00:00.929 --> 00:02.568
Previously
on <i>Covert Affairs...</i>

00:02.723 --> 00:05.124
Henry put out a hit
on Arthur and Joan.

00:05.191 --> 00:07.076
Arthur's been stabbed.

00:07.160 --> 00:09.028
Looks like Henry's
been using diamonds

00:09.079 --> 00:10.359
to launder
and move money around.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.465
We track down the diamond
courier to Henry,

00:12.532 --> 00:14.467
we grab Henry, and we take him
back to pay for what he's done.

00:14.534 --> 00:16.836
And why would you
come looking for me?

00:16.887 --> 00:19.204
You can have all
the diamonds for yourself.

00:19.256 --> 00:21.307
Auggie, I didn't stay
to try to catch him.

00:21.374 --> 00:22.308
I have a different plan now.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.309
You know that, right?

00:23.376 --> 00:25.011
You know I'm with you.

00:25.062 --> 00:26.812
No matter how this thing ends.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.815
Hey.
You lookin' for this?

00:32.552 --> 00:35.488
Hello, Ms. Walker.

02:05.946 --> 02:07.146
Sir, you're not
allowed in this area.

02:07.197 --> 02:08.497
Sir, you can't
come in this area.

02:08.582 --> 02:09.699
Hey, are you security?

02:09.782 --> 02:11.784
I need you to find Raymond Kent
for me, now.

02:11.835 --> 02:13.536
Okay, sir, there's no Raymond
Kent in this consulate.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.155
Right, find him, tell him
Auggie Anderson's here.

02:16.206 --> 02:17.156
Okay, let's step back
to the gate, please.

02:17.207 --> 02:18.924
No, no, no.
Just call him.

02:18.992 --> 02:20.960
Guys, I got this.

02:21.011 --> 02:22.261
I got this.
Kent?

02:22.328 --> 02:23.328
I got here as soon as I could.

02:23.380 --> 02:24.847
Come on.

02:24.931 --> 02:26.465
Could we speak freely?

02:26.516 --> 02:27.550
Yeah,
it's the middle of night.

02:27.634 --> 02:29.668
Everyone's sleeping.
All right.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.221
We have a high level operative
working in the city.

02:32.305 --> 02:34.006
If I don't get her the support
she needs,

02:34.057 --> 02:36.341
she's gonna be in the hands
of the MSS by sunrise.

02:36.393 --> 02:38.010
I need a second in command.

02:38.061 --> 02:39.395
I got an officer
I can free up.

02:39.479 --> 02:40.512
All right.

02:40.564 --> 02:41.680
I need a desk
and some computers.

02:41.732 --> 02:43.372
If you have access
to the security cameras

02:43.450 --> 02:45.568
in Kowloon East,
I'll need those feeds too.

02:45.652 --> 02:47.570
Okay.

03:21.071 --> 03:23.889
I have to say,
you surprised me by going dark.

03:23.940 --> 03:26.742
I didn't know you had it in you.

03:26.827 --> 03:29.061
I was always
the leap first type.

03:29.112 --> 03:31.730
But this time, no parachute.

03:31.782 --> 03:35.117
Oliver Li is on a plane
to D.C. with his intel.

03:35.202 --> 03:37.002
You will be tried
and convicted.

03:37.070 --> 03:38.871
How?

03:38.922 --> 03:40.873
I'm here.

03:42.843 --> 03:44.576
But you're here alone.

03:44.628 --> 03:45.761
Completely.

03:45.846 --> 03:48.047
No, not completely.

03:48.098 --> 03:49.932
You're here with me.

03:50.016 --> 03:51.467
And it's fitting,

03:51.551 --> 03:58.524
because you and I
are not so different.

03:58.591 --> 04:00.559
Yes, we are.

04:00.610 --> 04:04.480
It was not so long ago that
we sat across from each other

04:04.564 --> 04:08.150
in that diner
and you were so excited

04:08.235 --> 04:11.570
to see the file
I had on Arthur.

04:13.606 --> 04:17.076
Arthur's alive,
by the way.

04:17.127 --> 04:21.630
Joan called from the hospital.

04:21.714 --> 04:25.718
Medical intervention
doesn't guarantee survival.

04:25.785 --> 04:28.003
Didn't work out so well

04:28.088 --> 04:31.623
for Teo Braga, did it?

04:31.675 --> 04:37.680
You went after Teo,
Helen, Arthur, and Joan.

04:37.764 --> 04:40.900
You went after
a pregnant woman.

04:40.967 --> 04:44.904
You've crossed
every line, Henry.

04:48.191 --> 04:50.860
There is a fable

04:50.944 --> 04:56.248
in which a frog gives a scorpion
a ride across a river.

04:56.316 --> 04:59.585
Somehow, he's surprised
when the scorpion stings him.

04:59.652 --> 05:03.205
You're the scorpion
in this scenario, I assume?

05:03.290 --> 05:08.427
And to explain his actions,
the scorpion simply says,

05:08.494 --> 05:10.546
"I'm a scorpion.

05:10.630 --> 05:12.715
It's my nature."

05:12.799 --> 05:17.353
You all seem to think
I should be something different.

05:17.437 --> 05:18.771
But I'm not.

05:18.838 --> 05:21.774
You're a traitor.

05:24.361 --> 05:25.311
No.

05:25.362 --> 05:29.148
I'm no traitor.

05:29.199 --> 05:32.985
I'm just a man who's willing
to take actions

05:33.036 --> 05:35.988
based on his convictions.

05:46.466 --> 05:49.969
If you saying I'm a traitor,

05:50.036 --> 05:54.556
then you must want to kill me.

05:54.641 --> 05:57.009
There's your opportunity.

06:02.933 --> 06:05.217
It's empty.

06:08.271 --> 06:09.939
How did you know that?

06:10.023 --> 06:12.274
Because you are a scorpion,

06:12.359 --> 06:16.278
and every word
out of your mouth is a lie.

Auggie Anderson?

06:50.421 --> 06:51.421
Yeah.

06:51.505 --> 06:53.840
I'm Sarah Tam.

06:53.907 --> 06:57.510
Mr. Kent said--said
that you needed

06:57.577 --> 06:58.845
the best officer he's got.

06:58.912 --> 07:00.046
You're looking at her.

07:00.097 --> 07:04.851
I mean--what are we working on?

07:04.918 --> 07:06.803
We're supporting a high-level,
deep cover operative.

07:06.887 --> 07:08.221
- Okay.
- I need you to cloak

07:08.272 --> 07:10.807
an office building
in Kowloon East for me.

07:10.891 --> 07:12.475
- A full shutdown?
- Everything.

07:12.559 --> 07:14.944
All incoming and outgoing
communications,

07:15.028 --> 07:17.429
nearby cell towers
need to be neutralized,

07:17.481 --> 07:19.365
Internet portals need
to be taken offline,

07:19.432 --> 07:21.868
and all telephony
to and from the main switcher

07:21.935 --> 07:23.319
need to be rendered inoperable.

07:23.403 --> 07:26.405
Yes, sir.

07:32.045 --> 07:35.965
Calder Michaels delivering
Oliver Li for debrief.

07:41.305 --> 07:44.140
Good luck, Oliver.

07:44.224 --> 07:47.143
Here's to a bright future.

08:03.527 --> 08:05.477
Thanks for
assembling so quickly.

08:05.529 --> 08:07.530
With the attempts on the lives
of Joan and Arthur Campbell,

08:07.614 --> 08:09.782
the DCI has asked me
to convene a response team

08:09.833 --> 08:12.668
of senior staff to deal
with the Henry Wilcox threat.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.087
You told us Wilcox was vetted,
Braithwaite.

08:15.155 --> 08:16.589
You brought him on
as a green badge.

08:16.656 --> 08:18.007
This is a shock to us all.

08:18.091 --> 08:20.009
Henry was instrumental in
bringing down Annie Walker,

08:20.093 --> 08:21.177
a rogue operative.

08:21.261 --> 08:22.879
I mistook him for a patriot.

08:22.963 --> 08:26.165
Henry Wilcox's traitorous ways
run deep.

08:26.216 --> 08:27.383
I have just returned
from Hong Kong,

08:27.467 --> 08:28.718
where Auggie Anderson and I

08:28.802 --> 08:30.686
turned and extradited Oliver Li,

08:30.771 --> 08:33.306
one of China's top spies
who was colluding with Henry.

08:33.357 --> 08:34.557
China?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.508
Where does State come down
on this, Suzanne?

08:36.559 --> 08:38.561
Well, Beijing is being
discrete to save face,

08:38.645 --> 08:40.279
but they still
want their guy back.

08:40.347 --> 08:43.198
Now, Li has been
a veritable font of intel

08:43.283 --> 08:45.568
on Henry Wilcox's operation.

08:45.652 --> 08:48.020
Henry orchestrated the
helicopter attack in Copenhagen,

08:48.071 --> 08:51.457
and the foiled bombing of
Solstar executives in Medellin.

08:51.524 --> 08:52.992
Unbelievable.

08:53.043 --> 08:54.460
Have we verified this intel?

08:54.527 --> 08:57.863
So far everything syncs
up with Henry's movements

08:57.915 --> 08:59.382
over the last six months.

08:59.466 --> 09:01.200
It's extremely damning.

09:01.251 --> 09:02.885
Do we know
where Wilcox is now?

09:02.970 --> 09:04.136
Hong Kong.

09:04.204 --> 09:06.088
Well, he might as well
be in downtown Tehran.

09:06.173 --> 09:09.842
There's no way we're
getting him out of there.

09:09.893 --> 09:10.927
Joan.

09:11.011 --> 09:13.312
Yes.

09:13.380 --> 09:16.515
I thought Joan could help shed
some light on Henry's actions,

09:16.567 --> 09:17.900
so I called her in.

09:17.985 --> 09:19.819
Do you disagree?

09:19.886 --> 09:20.820
No, no.

09:20.887 --> 09:22.238
No, of course not.

09:22.322 --> 09:23.689
Just given what's transpired,

09:23.740 --> 09:25.408
are you sure
you want to be here?

09:25.492 --> 09:29.528
Given what's transpired,
I'm sure I need to be here.

09:29.580 --> 09:32.064
We were just going over with
State how problematic it will be

09:32.115 --> 09:33.616
getting Henry
out of Hong Kong.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.368
Try "impossible."

09:35.419 --> 09:37.503
This is Edward Snowden
times 100.

09:37.570 --> 09:40.423
Henry Wilcox needs to be
brought back here for justice.

09:40.507 --> 09:42.208
Rest assured, Joan,
we're into this.

09:42.259 --> 09:43.742
You don't have to
worry much longer

09:43.794 --> 09:45.294
about being in harm's way.

09:45.379 --> 09:48.514
Everyone in this building
puts themselves in harm's way

09:48.581 --> 09:49.915
when they sign up for this job.

09:49.967 --> 09:52.251
You have my word,
justice will be served.

09:52.302 --> 09:53.386
Please know that.

09:53.437 --> 09:56.389
I hope so.

09:58.692 --> 10:01.611
If everyone
will open their folders--

10:39.466 --> 10:41.967
Thank you.

10:42.019 --> 10:42.985
The building's cloaked.

10:43.070 --> 10:44.636
Good.
Is your team in position?

10:44.688 --> 10:45.855
They're ready.

10:45.939 --> 10:47.189
Don't send 'em in
until my go ahead.

10:47.274 --> 10:48.407
We have one shot at this.

10:48.475 --> 10:51.410
It has to be perfect.

11:02.422 --> 11:05.091
You changed your tie.

11:05.158 --> 11:07.093
You want to change your luck?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.679
I don't believe in luck.

11:09.763 --> 11:12.682
Don't tell that
to the Chinese.

11:22.059 --> 11:24.894
Yeah, I know.
Fix it!

11:26.780 --> 11:29.031
Something wrong?

11:29.116 --> 11:30.900
Not your concern.

11:30.984 --> 11:32.151
Let's face it.

11:32.202 --> 11:34.686
You're a man without a country,

11:34.738 --> 11:37.623
without a home,
without a family.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.691
- Doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

11:39.743 --> 11:40.910
It always matters.

11:40.994 --> 11:43.212
Our relationships are
what define us as spies,

11:43.296 --> 11:45.531
and you have none.

11:45.582 --> 11:50.086
Says the woman
the world thinks is dead.

11:50.170 --> 11:53.222
A strange choice--a bold
choice to go dark.

11:53.306 --> 11:55.224
You're turning your back
on something.

11:55.308 --> 11:56.559
What are you running from?

11:58.678 --> 12:01.597
What was that?

12:10.440 --> 12:13.392
Looks like CIA, sir.

12:19.399 --> 12:22.334
Shoot to kill.

12:56.369 --> 12:59.822
What are they saying?

12:59.906 --> 13:01.457
"Multiple shots fired at
our building in Kowloon East."

13:01.541 --> 13:03.742
I told you not to send
the team until my signal.

13:03.794 --> 13:06.045
We didn't send that team.

13:06.112 --> 13:07.797
Is your team
still in position?

13:07.881 --> 13:09.381
- Yes.
- Well, send 'em!

13:09.449 --> 13:10.549
Now.
Get her out.

13:26.817 --> 13:28.267
We have a vehicle
hot and ready.

13:28.318 --> 13:32.271
Let's go.
Keep an eye on her.

14:11.862 --> 14:14.179
Put down the gun.

14:14.231 --> 14:15.614
Drop the weapon.

14:15.682 --> 14:18.367
Don't shoot her!

14:18.451 --> 14:21.370
Put down the gun.

14:47.931 --> 14:50.882
It's clear.

15:12.071 --> 15:13.505
What's your move here, Henry?

15:13.573 --> 15:15.591
You've shown your true self,
Ms. Walker.

15:15.675 --> 15:16.675
You went after Joan
and Arthur.

15:16.743 --> 15:17.743
Did you really think
that after--

15:17.794 --> 15:20.746
Don't talk!

15:24.217 --> 15:28.137
Let's move, let's move,
let's move!

15:31.391 --> 15:34.526
Cover, cover!

15:37.814 --> 15:40.766
Cover! Cover!

15:55.415 --> 15:58.250
You still need me
if we're gonna survive.

15:58.301 --> 15:59.468
There is no "we."

15:59.552 --> 16:00.803
There's only me.

16:00.887 --> 16:03.455
I'm trading you
to the Chinese.

16:10.155 --> 16:12.154
Eh, you want to tell me
what that was?

16:12.155 --> 16:14.029
What the hell are you
talking about, Anderson?

16:14.113 --> 16:15.480
Langley sent in a TAC team.

16:15.531 --> 16:17.482
I thought you were handling
things on your end.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.084
A TAC team?
Where?

16:19.151 --> 16:20.985
Henry's offices in Kowloon.

16:21.037 --> 16:23.121
The team was decimated.

16:23.172 --> 16:25.040
Annie and Henry
are in the wind.

16:25.124 --> 16:26.991
Who would have the knowledge
of Henry's whereabouts

16:27.043 --> 16:31.329
in Hong Kong and the power
to order a TAC team?

16:31.381 --> 16:32.998
Braithwaite.

16:33.066 --> 16:35.500
On it.

16:35.551 --> 16:37.469
You didn't get him?

16:37.520 --> 16:40.472
How many men?

16:44.193 --> 16:47.145
And where is Henry now?

17:10.837 --> 17:11.752
Mr. Braithwaite?

17:11.838 --> 17:13.338
The DCI would like to see you.

17:13.388 --> 17:15.507
He'd like you to bring any files
or correspondences

17:15.558 --> 17:17.342
you have
in regards to Henry Wilcox.

17:17.393 --> 17:18.727
Thank you.

17:18.810 --> 17:21.730
Tell him I won't be long.

17:23.549 --> 17:26.484
Close the door.

18:45.314 --> 18:48.266
After you.

18:50.987 --> 18:53.772
The Chinese spy service will
register our presence here

18:53.823 --> 18:56.775
and send someone
in short order.

18:59.311 --> 19:02.414
I'm sure the motion sensor

19:02.481 --> 19:04.983
has already gotten

19:05.034 --> 19:08.837
Beijing buzzing.

19:08.921 --> 19:09.838
Have a seat.

19:09.922 --> 19:11.840
It shouldn't take long.

19:23.052 --> 19:24.970
This isn't much.

19:27.523 --> 19:28.473
Isn't much of what?

19:28.524 --> 19:31.676
Isn't much of a safe house.

19:31.727 --> 19:33.511
It isn't much of a plan.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.780
Comment all you want,
Ms. Walker,

19:35.848 --> 19:37.649
but this modest place

19:37.700 --> 19:40.368
is where the MSS
is going to torture you

19:40.453 --> 19:43.121
until you tell them
everything you know.

19:43.188 --> 19:49.360
Every secret... every truth.

19:49.412 --> 19:51.880
They're very effective
interrogators.

19:51.964 --> 19:53.882
Hmm.

19:56.719 --> 19:58.670
Mahjong?

20:05.728 --> 20:08.146
Braithwaite better
be ready to do some talking.

20:08.213 --> 20:09.431
This wasn't about justice.

20:09.515 --> 20:11.266
This was about him
covering his own ass.

20:11.350 --> 20:12.817
And he failed at both.

20:12.885 --> 20:13.985
Let me talk to him.

20:14.053 --> 20:15.236
I can get him to come clean

20:15.321 --> 20:18.239
if we don't overwhelm him.

20:21.110 --> 20:22.277
We're here to see Eric.

20:22.361 --> 20:25.113
- Where the hell is he?
- Where are you going?

20:25.197 --> 20:26.230
Braithwaite,
if you think you can--

20:26.282 --> 20:28.232
What's going on?

20:28.284 --> 20:31.235
What's going on?

20:33.122 --> 20:35.073
God damn it.

20:37.043 --> 20:39.961
I'll alert the DCI.

20:45.217 --> 20:49.104
Cordon off the hallway, and
call the SPO's, but quietly.

20:49.188 --> 20:53.108
Let's find a way to
give this guy his dignity.

21:48.647 --> 21:50.982
Thank you for coming.

21:51.033 --> 21:53.201
Why is the former DCS
of the CIA

21:53.285 --> 21:54.669
here in one of our safe houses?

21:54.754 --> 21:58.173
Oliver Li told me
I could always reach out

21:58.257 --> 22:00.675
using this method
if I had something to discuss.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.762
Oliver Li is in the hands
of the Americans.

22:03.829 --> 22:05.263
And this woman is to blame.

22:05.330 --> 22:06.831
Check your sources.

22:06.882 --> 22:11.186
I'm sure they have implicated
a dark-haired American woman

22:11.270 --> 22:15.640
in connection
with Oliver's abduction.

22:15.691 --> 22:18.977
And what do you
want in return?

22:19.028 --> 22:23.982
Asylum... and protection.

22:37.546 --> 22:40.498
I'll be right back.

22:51.727 --> 22:55.346
The saddest fact of all
is you went dark for nothing.

22:55.397 --> 22:58.549
This audacious gambit,

22:58.601 --> 23:02.937
this brusque persona,
this hair.

23:03.022 --> 23:05.440
You went all out.

23:05.524 --> 23:08.943
You gave up so much...

23:09.028 --> 23:11.863
And it simply
wasn't worth it.

23:11.914 --> 23:14.749
You simply
weren't cunning enough.

23:18.904 --> 23:21.339
You were right about her.

23:21.406 --> 23:26.127
My superiors are most thankful.

23:26.212 --> 23:27.712
Go here.

23:27.763 --> 23:31.182
We'll find a place for you.

23:31.250 --> 23:32.300
Pleasure doing business.

23:32.384 --> 23:36.137
The pleasure is all mine.

23:36.222 --> 23:37.605
I'm sure
you don't believe this,

23:37.690 --> 23:41.609
but I'm truly sorry
this has to end.

23:47.432 --> 23:50.368
Good-bye.

23:59.578 --> 24:02.413
Well, you can
call me Jonathan.

24:02.464 --> 24:05.416
And your name?

24:09.555 --> 24:11.455
Oh, your Cantonese is good.

24:11.507 --> 24:14.458
Please, sit.

24:17.462 --> 24:19.814
We'll figure out
your name soon enough.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.576
You understand
our need for diligence.

24:38.161 --> 24:41.079
This should not take long.

24:46.669 --> 24:51.590
This... is scopolamine.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.260
To help with the truth.

24:55.345 --> 24:57.896
Much better than
the sodium pentothal

24:57.981 --> 24:59.932
that the CIA is so fond of.

25:00.016 --> 25:02.935
This will only hurt a bit.

25:15.898 --> 25:18.166
Where did you
send Henry Wilcox?

25:18.234 --> 25:20.335
What is his location?

25:20.403 --> 25:21.620
I'm not telling you anything.

25:21.704 --> 25:23.171
The drugs haven't taken effect.

25:23.239 --> 25:25.757
You think I need drugs
to get the truth out of you?

25:25.842 --> 25:27.403
Are you willing to die
for Henry Wilcox?

25:27.427 --> 25:31.296
Because that
is what we are talking about.

25:31.381 --> 25:33.548
Kowloon train station.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.934
A train to Beijing.

26:29.305 --> 26:31.425
Auggie, there's an outside
line being patched through.

26:31.441 --> 26:34.359
It's for you.

26:36.245 --> 26:37.412
Yeah.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.614
The MSS is gonna start tracing
this phone

26:39.666 --> 26:41.116
if they haven't already.
All right.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.367
What's the update on Henry?

26:42.452 --> 26:43.952
Henry's in a car
headed to Kowloon station

26:44.003 --> 26:49.341
for a train to Beijing,
license plate "SQ 1971."

26:49.425 --> 26:50.959
Okay, you head
in that direction.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.461
We will slow him down.

26:52.512 --> 26:54.596
Get a burner phone,
text me the number.

26:54.663 --> 26:56.498
Thanks, Auggie.

26:59.802 --> 27:01.136
We need to activate
another Ops team.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.938
I'll go talk to
the station chief right now.

27:03.005 --> 27:04.940
Yeah.

27:38.508 --> 27:41.176
Text message received
from unknown.

27:41.227 --> 27:45.180
Message 30157.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.266
Auggie.

27:48.351 --> 27:50.051
Hey, what's the update
on that team?

27:50.103 --> 27:51.737
The station chief said no.

27:51.821 --> 27:53.438
The Chinese got word of
the shootout at Lexington.

27:53.523 --> 27:55.190
He doesn't want to risk
pissing them off anymore.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.743
He's not authorizing any
more operational forces.

27:57.827 --> 27:59.027
Hey, do you have a car?

27:59.078 --> 28:00.612
Yes?

28:00.696 --> 28:01.997
Is that a question,
or do you have a car?

28:02.064 --> 28:03.331
I have a car.

28:03.399 --> 28:04.783
Pull it up front,
come get me when it's here.

28:08.337 --> 28:09.421
Hello.

28:09.505 --> 28:11.623
Auggie,
what's the status on Annie?

28:11.707 --> 28:12.674
Mission not complete.

28:12.741 --> 28:13.759
Annie's still after the target.

28:13.843 --> 28:15.010
Damn it.

28:15.077 --> 28:16.511
I'll let you know
if something changes.

28:16.579 --> 28:17.745
All right.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.747
You may want to loop Calder in
on the progress.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.133
I'm gonna be a little tied up.

28:21.217 --> 28:22.684
You okay?

28:22.751 --> 28:24.686
I'm all right.

28:24.753 --> 28:26.555
Think I may
be having this baby, though.

28:26.606 --> 28:27.755
That's great news.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.775
Don't worry.
Annie'll find a way.

28:29.859 --> 28:32.694
I have no doubt.

28:43.623 --> 28:45.574
Arthur.

28:47.443 --> 28:50.412
I wasn't about to miss this.

28:50.463 --> 28:51.997
So glad you're here.

28:52.081 --> 28:53.498
Do you mind if I drive?

28:53.583 --> 28:55.500
Thank you.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.326
Oh.

29:21.410 --> 29:22.944
"Oh"?
What do you mean, "oh?"

29:22.995 --> 29:24.279
The MSS have Annie's photo.

29:24.330 --> 29:26.414
They've put it out onto
their internal security wire

29:26.482 --> 29:28.316
and they've looped in
Hong Kong police.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.817
They're gonna want
as many boots on the ground

29:29.869 --> 29:33.922
as they can get,
as fast as possible.

29:38.327 --> 29:41.046
Auggie, did you find
a way to slow down Henry?

29:41.130 --> 29:42.631
I'm workin' on it.

29:42.682 --> 29:46.184
The MSS just gave your picture
to the Hong Kong police force.

29:46.269 --> 29:48.270
Shit.

29:48.337 --> 29:49.888
Basically, one of the largest
police forces in the world

29:49.972 --> 29:51.732
has your picture
and they're looking for you.

29:51.774 --> 29:53.692
Got it.

30:11.029 --> 30:13.270
Let me know when we get
to the Victory Rd intersection.

30:15.585 --> 30:16.564
We're almost there.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.645
Alright, drive out to the middle
of the intersection.

30:18.725 --> 30:19.734
And then what?

30:19.735 --> 30:21.336
- Park it.
- Park it?

30:21.403 --> 30:24.455
Yeah, park it.

30:33.382 --> 30:37.302
We should get a cab.

31:55.931 --> 31:56.931
What the hell's going on?

31:56.932 --> 31:58.716
Traffic.

31:58.801 --> 32:01.719
We're about two kilometers away.

32:05.808 --> 32:08.609
Annie, we checked with the
traffic department's website.

32:08.677 --> 32:11.279
Traffic will be backed up
all around Kowloon Road.

32:11.346 --> 32:13.614
Got it.

35:00.458 --> 35:03.377
Hello, Henry.

35:17.494 --> 35:19.611
How'd you find me?

35:19.662 --> 35:21.196
Does it matter?

35:28.955 --> 35:32.207
It always matters.

37:14.611 --> 37:16.028
Annie.

37:16.095 --> 37:17.646
Auggie.

37:17.730 --> 37:21.200
I did it.
He's dead.

37:21.267 --> 37:24.603
Okay.

37:24.654 --> 37:26.438
We still need to get you
out of here.

37:26.489 --> 37:27.623
Can you get to the harbor?

37:27.707 --> 37:29.625
We have an inside man
at the Star Ferry.

37:29.709 --> 37:32.377
Pier three.

37:32.445 --> 37:35.113
Auggie, thanks for staying.

37:35.164 --> 37:37.282
You can thank me
in person later.

37:37.333 --> 37:40.285
Almost there.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.928
Annie Walker needs our help.

37:49.979 --> 37:52.931
Let's bring her in.

37:55.184 --> 37:59.438
By now, everyone should know
that Henry Wilcox is dead,

37:59.489 --> 38:00.805
and Annie Walker is alive

38:00.857 --> 38:02.908
and in need of support
in Kowloon.

38:02.975 --> 38:06.144
Auggie Anderson needs someone
to bigfoot DOD

38:06.195 --> 38:07.979
into giving her
a water egress home.

38:08.031 --> 38:09.665
I can put a call in
to Admiral O'Donnell.

38:09.749 --> 38:11.669
Great, have him call me
if there's any questions.

38:11.751 --> 38:14.453
Eric Braithwaite, well,

38:14.504 --> 38:16.171
you've all been read in
on that as well.

38:16.256 --> 38:19.508
How are we gonna get this done
without a DCS?

38:19.592 --> 38:23.345
The chair's open,
Mr. Michaels.

38:23.429 --> 38:24.930
You want me as DCS?

38:24.997 --> 38:26.048
Interim.

38:26.132 --> 38:27.516
The DCI insisted.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.802
Your gambit with operative
Walker was a masterstroke.

38:30.853 --> 38:32.971
You've brought down
one of the biggest traitors

38:33.022 --> 38:34.022
in our agency's history.

38:34.107 --> 38:37.059
Thank you, sir.

38:37.143 --> 38:38.277
What about Joan Campbell?

38:38.344 --> 38:40.479
I'm not about to
step on someone

38:40.530 --> 38:42.397
who just survived
an attempt on her life,

38:42.482 --> 38:44.232
who's about to have a baby...
You're not stepping on her.

38:44.317 --> 38:45.233
Who served in this position.

38:45.318 --> 38:47.185
You're not stepping on her.

38:47.236 --> 38:49.071
She'll have a chance
to properly compete for the job

38:49.155 --> 38:52.074
when the time comes.

38:55.861 --> 38:57.379
We won't discuss this further

38:57.463 --> 38:59.498
until Annie Walker
is home safe, got it?

38:59.549 --> 39:01.466
All right.

39:01.534 --> 39:04.202
Suzanne,
contact DOD immediately.

39:04.253 --> 39:06.254
I'll get the Asia desk to
marshall all their resources

39:06.339 --> 39:07.372
on the ground.

39:31.831 --> 39:34.416
Thank you.

39:36.035 --> 39:37.586
Auggie, I don't think
the ferry's gonna work.

39:37.670 --> 39:38.620
I need--
Halt.

39:38.705 --> 39:40.122
Can I call you back in a sec?

39:40.206 --> 39:43.458
Thank you.

39:46.212 --> 39:48.413
I don't know
if I have a sec.

39:55.021 --> 39:56.605
She can't make the ferry.

39:56.689 --> 39:57.606
Get me something else.

39:57.690 --> 40:00.425
I don't care what it costs.

40:31.123 --> 40:33.508
We'll get you out
to the U.S. carrier group

40:33.593 --> 40:35.677
in the South China Sea.

40:35.762 --> 40:37.396
You're looking at about
a 1/2 day sailing.

40:38.798 --> 40:39.848
I hope you like your ride.

40:39.932 --> 40:42.851
It's nice out here
on the water.

40:42.935 --> 40:44.486
Hey, I got someone
back in the states

40:44.570 --> 40:45.570
who wants to talk to you.

40:45.605 --> 40:49.191
Hold on.

40:49.275 --> 40:52.494
Glad you're safe, Annie.

40:52.578 --> 40:54.362
Joan.

40:54.447 --> 40:55.530
I know it hasn't been easy,

40:55.615 --> 40:57.499
but you've done
extraordinary work.

40:57.583 --> 40:58.583
Thank you.

40:58.651 --> 40:59.668
And when you get back,

40:59.752 --> 41:01.486
there's somebody
who wants to meet you.

41:01.537 --> 41:03.705
You had the baby?

41:03.790 --> 41:05.657
It's a boy.

41:05.708 --> 41:07.626
Mackenzie Campbell.

41:11.297 --> 41:13.014
Congratulations.

41:13.099 --> 41:14.633
We'll all see you
when you get back.

41:14.684 --> 41:16.668
Travel safe.
