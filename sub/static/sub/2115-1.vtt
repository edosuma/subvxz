09:05.746 --> 09:07.312

09:07.314 --> 09:09.080

a lot of money to make sure
jump street keeps going.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.353
We've doubled their budget.

guaranteed twice the profit.

Yeah. Well,
the commissioner's convinced
this debacle happened

09:25.866 --> 09:28.600
because you weren't
doing the same
undercover student thing

09:28.602 --> 09:30.001
you did the first time.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.337
She doesn't get
that it's always worse

09:32.339 --> 09:33.339
the second time around.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.207
You settle into
worn-out roles.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.877
One gets possessive,
the other runs away.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.079
You begin a slow,
painful unraveling,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.615
as all the good things
that came before

09:43.617 --> 09:47.052
begin to be crushed
by the trash compactor of sadness.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.221
That doesn't sound like us.
I mean... (CHUCKLES)

09:50.223 --> 09:51.890
I'm getting a divorce.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.528
We don't want to
do the same thing.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.930
We want to burst
through our ceiling.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.265
And you're gonna
find another ceiling

10:00.267 --> 10:01.800
and you got to
bust through that one,

10:01.802 --> 10:02.601
and you just got to
keep hammering ceilings.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.502
Okay, okay, okay.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.172
What if we actually went
into the secret service

10:07.174 --> 10:08.640
and, like, tried to
protect the white house?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.809

I don't think that would work.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.544
I'm going to ask you
to stop talking.

10:12.546 --> 10:13.979
I thought it was
a pretty good idea.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.716
Do the same thing as last time,
everyone's happy.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.655

their church back.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.423

10:25.425 --> 10:27.158

directly across the street.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.829
Yeah. That's convenient.
Yes, it is convenient.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.364
Next year, we'll probably
just be right back across the street.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.798
MALE STUDENT: Okay,
we got time for just
one more improve game.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.800
For this one,
we need a ton of
different suggestions.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.036
So, we just need you guys
to fill in the blank

20:05.038 --> 20:06.637
in a sentence that
we're gonna set up.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.373
So it'll go like this.
Oh, I'm so hungry,
I wish I had a...

20:09.375 --> 20:11.342
Tampon!
Okay, but we want...

20:11.344 --> 20:12.710
We want it to be actual food

20:12.712 --> 20:14.145
so that it, like,
makes sense
with the game.

20:14.147 --> 20:17.081
It's more fun that way.
So, uh, let's try it
one more time.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.116
Oh, I've got to get home
so I can feed my...

20:19.118 --> 20:20.651
Boner!

20:20.653 --> 20:21.953
You know what?
Let's just play
the game, okay?

20:21.955 --> 20:24.388
GIRL: All right,
so what would you...

20:24.390 --> 20:25.856
Hey, that girl's
in my psych class.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.258
Damn, she's hot.
Go talk to her.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.759
You come talk to her with me.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.462
Stop being a pussy
and go talk to her. Go.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.763
<i>All right, all right.</i>

20:32.765 --> 20:34.832
<i>Coming to the stage, we got...</i>

20:37.469 --> 20:38.970
<i>J. Bohnes, aka...</i>

20:38.972 --> 20:41.072
Hey.
Hi.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.554
I think we're in
the same psych class.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.642
Oh, yeah. Hi.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.244
Yeah.

20:47.312 --> 20:51.115
<i>Pills! Pills!
Bills! Pills!</i>

20:51.117 --> 20:54.619
<i>Bills! A sign of

20:54.621 --> 20:56.487

20:59.158 --> 21:01.058

21:01.060 --> 21:03.027
You guys are
the improve guys, right?
Yeah.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.428
That's cool.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.230
You're the guy with
the terrible suggestions.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.933
Yeah, yeah.
You're welcome, man.
Yeah.

21:08.935 --> 21:12.236
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>
<i>Um, lady J is gonna</i>
<i>be up next for you.</i>

21:12.238 --> 21:14.639
Cynthia, that girl who died,

21:14.641 --> 21:15.840
she used to come here
all the time, right?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.074
Mmm.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.877
This piece is called <i> areolas.</i>

21:19.879 --> 21:22.346
Did you know her?

21:22.348 --> 21:24.315
Yeah, she lived
across the hall from me.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.750
Yeah?
So why do you care so much?

21:26.351 --> 21:28.352
I'm... I'm writing a...

21:29.154 --> 21:30.588
<i>Greedy man hands!</i>

21:30.590 --> 21:33.157
...a slam poem
in her honor.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.759
Early stages, very early stages.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.060
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.561
Wouldn't it be better

21:37.563 --> 21:39.130
just to, like,
plan the stuff out
ahead of time,

21:39.132 --> 21:42.800
and then not say it
in front of people
and embarrass yourself?

21:42.802 --> 21:46.237
That's a thing
that people do.
That's stand-up comedy.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.371
That's probably
what you should do,

21:47.373 --> 21:49.073
because that stuff's funny.

21:49.075 --> 21:53.010
<i>My brown nipple</i>

<i>during lactation...</i>

21:53.012 --> 21:54.612
What do you think of this?

21:54.614 --> 21:56.614
I actually think
it's really powerful.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.149
That's cool that you said that,

21:58.151 --> 22:00.351
'cause I actually thought it
was really powerful, too,

22:00.353 --> 22:03.020
when the one girl
was talking about
her nips and shit.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.755
(APPLAUSE)

22:04.757 --> 22:08.426

22:08.428 --> 22:09.760
Let's see what you got.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.395
<i>Any more poets in the audience?</i>

22:11.397 --> 22:12.797
I...
I mean, do you
really do poetry?

22:13.131 --> 22:14.799
I do, and I will.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.167
I got somebody.
What?

22:16.169 --> 22:18.969
<i>Okay, we got somebody.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.371

Okay.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.639
Just go up there.
All right, okay.

22:21.641 --> 22:22.807
Okay.
No pressure.

22:22.809 --> 22:23.849
You'll see,
it's good.

I don't have a single lead.

23:48.194 --> 23:51.028
I do. I hear you can
get whyphy on campus
anywhere 24/7.

23:53.231 --> 23:54.899
Do you think they mean
whyphy the drug

23:54.901 --> 23:55.941
or WI-Fi like
the Internet?

23:57.335 --> 23:58.869

24:00.238 --> 24:02.339
Fuck you, brain.

24:02.341 --> 24:05.509
How did we find
the dealers so easy
the first time?

24:05.511 --> 24:07.011
Well, his number was
literally on a sticker.

24:07.013 --> 24:09.013
Well, let's go find
this guy's sticker.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.781
I don't think this guy
does stickers.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.717
Well, we need help.
We need to consult
an expert.

24:13.719 --> 24:15.686
KENNY: Yo, dude, you shot
him in the dick, dude.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.754
I got him

Yep.

Shot him in the dick.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.436
Hey, you should get
some tips from this guy.

24:32.438 --> 24:35.172
He's looking good.
Look at those
pectoral muscles.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.241
That's the kind of definition
I want out of you, man.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.076
What's up, Eric?
Hey.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.645
Mr. Walters,
we should, um...

24:41.647 --> 24:43.180
Or I should apologize for, uh...

24:45.617 --> 24:47.117
For shooting my penis off?

24:47.119 --> 24:48.486
Yeah.
Yeah.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.822
Don't sweat it, brother.
I'm liberated. Totally.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.064
You know they gave me a vagina?

24:53.758 --> 24:55.693
It's awesome.
You guys want
to see it?

24:55.695 --> 24:57.761
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.930
That's fine.
All right.
Eric's seen it.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.266
Eric's been all
up in that shit.
Isn't that right, Eric?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.734
You guys got to get me
the fuck out of here.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.768
Hey, guess what.

Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry, honey.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.914
I didn't mean that.
You know that, right?

25:16.916 --> 25:18.883
I am such a bitch
when aunt Flo shows up.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.886
It bleeds so much, it's crazy.

Your vagina doesn't
fucking work, man.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.627
Worked for you
last night. (CHUCKLES)

25:29.629 --> 25:32.963
You are
so clearly forcing Eric
into this relationship.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.032
Eric, am I forcing you
into anything?

25:35.034 --> 25:37.268
Yes.
(CHUCKLES) See?

25:37.270 --> 25:38.669
Look, they sent us
in undercover
at a college

25:38.671 --> 25:40.304
to find the dealer
of this new synthetic,

25:40.306 --> 25:42.339
and no one will
tell us anything.

25:42.341 --> 25:44.608
That's 'cause
you guys look like
fucking narcs, all right?

25:44.610 --> 25:46.210
College kids
aren't dumb like Eric.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.845
I was supposed
to go to Berkeley.

25:47.847 --> 25:50.581
Well,
they gave us a picture,
so we do have that.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.749
Well, that's your lead,
motherfucker!

25:51.751 --> 25:53.651
That's what you start with.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.619
I know,
but we can't see his face,
so we don't know who it is.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.655
We don't know who it is.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.723
I'm Schmidt. My pants
are filled with doody.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.792
(GROANS) That's you.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.194
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

26:04.029 --> 26:05.596
You sort of sound like that.

26:05.598 --> 26:06.764
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

26:06.766 --> 26:07.831
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.266
It's not not you.

26:09.268 --> 26:13.237
Eric! Close your eyes
and tell me who's
talking right now.

a good impression.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.679
Nice job, super sleuths.

26:21.681 --> 26:22.980
Did you even
bother to look at
the fucking picture?

26:23.481 --> 26:25.015
Yeah.
Huh?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.297
There's a reflection right here.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.987
Your fucking guy's got a tattoo.

26:29.989 --> 26:33.557
Find the tattoo,
find the dealer.

26:33.559 --> 26:37.728
Fuck, man, I don't know.
I do a lot of stupid
tattoos to drunk kids.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.063
Do you remember
that stupid tattoo?

26:39.065 --> 26:40.931
TATTOO ARTIST:
A bazooka?

I don't know.

look the same to me.

Dude, holy shit, bro.
Great fucking catch, dude.

28:40.686 --> 28:44.455
If you see that
safety line up that deep,
though, hit me quicker.

28:44.457 --> 28:46.356
Oh, yeah, I didn't know
you had wheels
like that, bro.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.058
It's funny, 'cause
he's my brother. So...

28:48.626 --> 28:50.194
Um...

28:50.196 --> 28:53.931
Hey, uh, you know, we have
this rush party at zeta.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.800
But I thought, you know,
you could come by
and meet the guys.

28:56.802 --> 28:58.302
It'd be really fun, I think.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.436
Great.
Yeah, maybe we will.

29:00.972 --> 29:02.606
Are you guys, like, together?

29:02.608 --> 29:04.508
Yeah.
Yeah, this is my bro.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.044
(LAUGHING) That's...
Funny, dude. You're funny.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.012
Oh.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.714
Uh, really?
Wow. Um, okay.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.483
Yeah, man, sure.
You, too, you can come, too.

29:12.485 --> 29:13.917
We'll see what we can do.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.052
Also, I said
a bunch of stuff earlier

29:15.054 --> 29:16.186
that you didn't acknowledge...

29:16.188 --> 29:18.055
Great catch.
Cool, yeah.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.156
See you then.
So you won't
address that?

29:19.158 --> 29:20.624
What the fuck's up
with that guy?

29:20.626 --> 29:22.526
All we have to do now
is rush the frat
long enough

29:22.528 --> 29:25.295
to confirm that
rooster has that
bazooka tattoo.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.364
Look, man, do you think
it's cool if you come?

29:27.366 --> 29:29.533
'Cause, I mean, he kind of
really just asked me.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.601
I just don't want to start off

29:30.603 --> 29:31.301
on the wrong foot with this guy.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.637
(LAUGHS)

29:33.639 --> 29:36.206
Dude, you're tripping.
We do everything together.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.841
You should lose
the puka shells, though.

29:37.843 --> 29:40.210
Things are different
since you didn't
go to college.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.678
(MUSIC PLAYING)

29:41.680 --> 29:43.347
Yo, Brad!
What's up, dude?

29:44.315 --> 29:45.716
Same puka, dude.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.017
You got the same...
Puka bros.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.259
ZOOK: Holy shit!
(BOTH LAUGHING)

29:49.354 --> 29:50.454
Look at him,
it's, like, all the same.

29:50.456 --> 29:51.955
Dude, you wear pants, too?

29:51.957 --> 29:54.024
What? Bros, man.
Dude.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.626
I knew we were gonna be
connected, just like that.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.094
Yeah, why don't you guys
just tie your dicks together

29:57.096 --> 29:57.895
and get married, right, rooster?

29:57.897 --> 29:59.930
Rooster. What's up, bro?

29:59.932 --> 30:01.431
You look good, man.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.766
What's up, rooster?

30:02.768 --> 30:04.434
How you doing, man?
Digging the puka.

30:04.436 --> 30:05.769
Thanks, dude. I can't
believe it's the same...

30:05.771 --> 30:07.070
How you doing, rooster?

30:07.072 --> 30:08.205
Rooster is getting some pop.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.447
Why don't you go check him out?

30:13.478 --> 30:14.545
JENKO: You in the zone, bro?
ZOOK: In the fucking zone,
dude.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.380
(IMITATING EXPLOSIONS)

30:19.551 --> 30:20.951
Hey. What's up?

30:21.719 --> 30:22.920
What's up? I'm rooster.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.755
Oh, yeah, no.

30:24.757 --> 30:26.089
We've met before.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.524
Oh, really? I don't
remember that at all.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.459
You must just have
a really plain face.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.261
Yeah. They call me
ol' plain face.

30:31.963 --> 30:33.564
They call you that?

30:33.566 --> 30:36.600
So, do you have any body art
or, like, any ink I could see?

30:36.602 --> 30:38.602
That's a pretty random question.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.071
Hey, anyway, it was so nice
chatting with you, man.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.406
Nice to meet you, man.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.440
Yo, what the fuck, bro?

30:43.442 --> 30:44.641
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing, dude?

30:44.643 --> 30:45.676
You serious
right now?
You...

30:45.678 --> 30:47.044
You're being weird.

30:48.379 --> 30:49.379
You've been weird.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.684
JENKO: It was just like,
what am I hearing?

30:53.686 --> 30:54.918
What am I hearing right now?

30:54.920 --> 30:55.919
And the psychic told you that?

30:55.921 --> 30:57.521
Yo.
That is so crazy, dude.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.189
Hey, dude, you want to
go see the roof?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.557
Fuck yeah, I want to
see the roof, dude.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.226
Come on, let's go,
let's go. Come on.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.188
Come on to the roof,
come on to the roof.
Let's go.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.234
JENKO: Come on, you can do it.
Come on, come on, come on!

31:10.236 --> 31:11.335
(LAUGHING)

31:13.004 --> 31:15.472
I miss climbing so much.
Come on, let's go. Come on.

31:15.474 --> 31:16.540
All right, uh...

31:21.679 --> 31:23.080
One more time.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.015
I'm just gonna go home.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.283
I don't know parkour, so...

31:27.452 --> 31:28.452
All right.

31:33.491 --> 31:35.025
Hey, Maya Angelou!

31:35.526 --> 31:36.960
(LAUGHS)

31:36.962 --> 31:39.496
Poetry, okay.
I got it. (CHUCKLES)

31:39.498 --> 31:40.658
Make fun of the poetry major.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.533
So, I guess you have no interest

31:43.535 --> 31:45.168
in having a real job
in the future.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.371
Absolutely not.
No, right?

31:47.373 --> 31:49.773
(BOTH LAUGH)
What about you?

31:49.775 --> 31:52.142
Um, I'm an art major.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.245
Okay. So you definitely
cannot talk any shit,
'cause...

31:55.247 --> 31:57.281
No, I can't. I cannot.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.181
...you're never gonna
make any money. (LAUGHS)

31:58.183 --> 32:00.183
I'm never gonna make any money,

32:00.185 --> 32:02.119
so don't tell my parents, but...

32:02.121 --> 32:03.320
When I talk to
your parents tonight,

32:03.322 --> 32:05.155
I will not tell them
about your major.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.757
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.191
All right, art major.

32:09.027 --> 32:10.961
What do you think about that?

32:12.931 --> 32:15.666
Um, I would say that

32:17.101 --> 32:20.070
it's these two beings

32:20.072 --> 32:22.940
leaning up
against each other
in perfect balance.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.609
If one were to fall,
they would just
lose each other.

32:26.577 --> 32:28.679
So it's just about support.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.483
You can't admit
that it looks
exactly like testicles?

32:35.253 --> 32:37.120
(LAUGHING) That's exactly
what it looks like.

32:40.224 --> 32:42.893
So, is there someone
who supports you?

32:42.895 --> 32:44.394
No, I'm just one of those people

32:44.396 --> 32:46.563
that really likes to
spend time with myself.

32:47.665 --> 32:50.033
Tell me about it.

32:50.035 --> 32:53.370
I love to be alone.
I am, like,
the best at it.

32:53.372 --> 32:56.373
I just love when you're
sitting there in a room,

32:56.375 --> 32:57.975
and you're just there
with your thoughts,

32:57.977 --> 33:00.043
and you're like,
oh, my gosh, I'm alone.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.845
Would anyone ever
love me? Or whatever.

33:01.847 --> 33:04.614
And, like, do I know
anyone who would care

33:04.616 --> 33:06.717
if I just ever came out
of this room or not?

33:06.719 --> 33:08.352
Or whatever and, like...

33:08.354 --> 33:09.519
I don't know.
It's just peaceful.
I just like it.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.154
Yeah.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.090
Well, if you don't want
to be alone tonight,

33:13.092 --> 33:14.852
we are gonna go hang out
at the art building,

33:14.959 --> 33:16.526
if you want to come.

33:17.095 --> 33:18.562
Okay, okay.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.631
Okay. Okay.

33:23.535 --> 33:24.735

33:28.106 --> 33:30.107
I expected tonight
would go in a way that
you wouldn't expect,

33:30.109 --> 33:31.508
but what I didn't expect
was tonight would go

33:31.510 --> 33:33.443
in the exact way
that you would expect.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.413
You know what I mean?
Totally.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.248
So you guys hang out here a lot?

33:38.250 --> 33:40.717
Yeah. I mean,
we're not into the whole
frat party kind of stuff.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.452
We like to sit around,
just drink some good wine

33:42.454 --> 33:44.454
and talk about
some important stuff.

33:44.456 --> 33:48.558
Banging bitches
and getting wasted
all fucking day.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.660
Those are, like, two of
my favorite things to do.

33:50.662 --> 33:53.296
You are, like,
a slightly less
attractive version of...

33:53.298 --> 33:54.464
Picasso?
Picasso.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.532
Right? I've been
told that before.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.534
You read my mind.

Oh, that's
Cynthia Watson's room.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.525
Oh.

34:22.527 --> 34:26.063
It's only 2:00.
I thought it was late.
Do you want to come in?

34:26.065 --> 34:29.331
It's only 2:00?
I usually go to dinner at,
like, 2:00 A.M., so...

34:29.333 --> 34:30.833
Sure, yeah, why not?

34:34.205 --> 34:36.764

I just got to get it
at the right angle.

Dude, stop.

Stupid fucking goalpost!

34:40.279 --> 34:42.712
It's impossible.
You can't fucking do it.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.848
The fans used to rush the field

34:44.850 --> 34:46.483
after every win
and tear down
the goalposts,

34:46.485 --> 34:49.052
and coach hated it.
And so he cemented
them in.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.454
They storm the field,
and still do it,

34:50.456 --> 34:52.222
but they just bounce around.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.556
ROOSTER: Fuck
this goalpost, bro!

34:53.559 --> 34:54.858

right there?

Mmm-hmm.

Look at it swim.

35:12.343 --> 35:14.678

What?

come to practice today?

35:25.757 --> 35:27.957
I mean,
you're obviously good enough
to play on the team.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.760
Look, I'm not
supposed to be here
to play football.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.462
What?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.464
I'm just here to
do my assignments

35:34.466 --> 35:36.366

35:36.368 --> 35:38.768

important or whatever,

35:38.770 --> 35:41.705
but when I was
throwing you those passes,

35:41.707 --> 35:44.227
it was like I knew
where you were gonna be
before you went there.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.344

like, vision of me

35:47.346 --> 35:50.547

to you, dude,

chanting and chanting,

35:58.357 --> 36:00.290
and then
the goalposts came down.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.893
Dude?

36:02.895 --> 36:05.829
I have had that exact vision,
like, my entire life.

It was a good time.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.290
Yeah, right.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.225
I enjoyed it.

Yeah.

what I'm doing here.

57:44.794 --> 57:46.328
I'm gonna tell you
something, all right?

57:46.330 --> 57:47.796
Can I trust you?
Yeah, of course.

57:53.203 --> 57:56.638
I have a friend who
knows a guy at umc.

57:57.407 --> 57:59.374
He's a scout. It's d-I.

57:59.376 --> 58:01.043
Their qb, he's not playing well.

58:01.045 --> 58:02.044
They're not happy
with the situation.

58:02.046 --> 58:03.412
They want me to make a tape.

58:03.414 --> 58:05.747
And I want you to
be on it with me.

58:09.619 --> 58:11.687
(STAMMERING) Nothing else?

58:11.689 --> 58:13.555
They had five guys in
the draft last year.

58:13.557 --> 58:14.823
I mean, Brad,
this could be our shot.

58:14.825 --> 58:16.859
We're like the dynamic duo, bro.

58:16.861 --> 58:19.294
We're like Batman and Robin.

58:19.296 --> 58:21.196
But we're both Batman.

58:21.198 --> 58:23.365
What do you want to be,
like, a stockbroker?

58:23.367 --> 58:24.900
Or a cop?

58:24.902 --> 58:26.768
Dude, your ceiling is, like,

58:27.704 --> 58:29.171
so high.

58:30.240 --> 58:34.009
You can just bust right...

58:34.011 --> 58:36.144
Just break
right through it.
Right through it.

58:36.146 --> 58:38.914
Right through it.
Right through it.

58:38.916 --> 58:40.883
You really think
I could make it at umc?

58:40.885 --> 58:44.219
Dude, you could make it
into the hall of fame.

58:44.221 --> 58:46.121
No, dude, come on, that's you.

58:46.123 --> 58:48.590
You're gonna be in,
like, the anals of
football history.

58:48.592 --> 58:51.159
Dude, you could make it
into the anals of
football history, too.

58:52.195 --> 58:55.697
We're gonna have to
tear those anals up.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.266
All right.
We're gonna
fucking tear it up.

58:57.268 --> 58:58.548
I mean, it's just a tape, right?

58:59.435 --> 59:00.769
I fucking hate my dad so much.

59:00.771 --> 59:02.170
Do you have any idea

59:02.172 --> 59:03.405
what it's like to
have a guy like that

59:03.407 --> 59:05.140
telling you what
to do all the time?
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

59:05.142 --> 59:06.575
I can only imagine.

59:06.577 --> 59:09.978
I just don't understand
what his problem is
with you specifically.

59:09.980 --> 59:12.814
(SIGHS) I don't... Jesus.
That makes no sense to me.

59:12.816 --> 59:13.916
I mean, you are
a perfectly good guy.

59:13.918 --> 59:15.017
You're very honest and nice.

59:15.019 --> 59:17.619
Why does my dad
have your phone number?

59:17.621 --> 59:20.188
I don't know.
Maybe the school
directory or something.

59:20.190 --> 59:21.557
Let's do something...

59:21.559 --> 59:22.424
Let's do something
that would distract us.

59:22.426 --> 59:24.059
Okay.

59:24.061 --> 59:26.128
So we don't have to think
about him anymore.

59:26.130 --> 59:27.729
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

59:27.731 --> 59:28.971
All right. Um...
(CLEARS THROAT)

59:29.465 --> 59:30.599
Maya.

59:32.669 --> 59:34.002
Is it okay if we just talk?

59:36.205 --> 59:37.205
Okay.

59:37.473 --> 59:39.508
Let's talk.

59:39.510 --> 59:41.276
No way.
Yeah.

59:41.278 --> 59:43.278
I was Peter Pan,
but then I was,
like, late.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.000
You're really close
with your brother, then.

59:45.515 --> 59:47.049
It seems like.
Yeah.

59:47.850 --> 59:49.284
Yeah, you know...

59:49.286 --> 59:50.319
(LAUGHING)

59:53.122 --> 59:54.823
You're a fucking genius, dude.

59:54.825 --> 59:56.465
Are you sure it's
not too much, though?
No!

59:57.594 --> 59:59.595
<i>Yeah!
Fuck, yeah!</i>

59:59.597 --> 01:00:01.897
All right? All right?
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:03.332
All night, bro.
Come on. All night.
Yeah, I know.

01:00:03.334 --> 01:00:04.800
It's gonna be so worth it, dude.

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:06.268
It's gonna be
fucking worth it,
I promise, all right?

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.736
Dude, you know what this needs?

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:09.504
BOTH: Another star wipe.

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:11.540
Jinx. Buy me a beer.
(CHUCKLING)

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:12.641
Nice twist.

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:13.742
On what?

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.312
MAYA: I can't believe we've
been talking all night.

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:21.316
Oh, my God, it's 8:00.
I have class, actually.

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:23.418
Okay.
I...

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.288
Yeah, you can help yourself
to whatever you need, and...

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.623
All right.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.524
Yeah, I'm so sorry,
this... (CHUCKLES)

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:30.993
I'll see you.

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:32.027
I'll see you later.

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:33.762
Okay.
Best night ever.

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:35.197
Okay. Bye.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.367

(CLEARS THROAT)

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.275
Like, the longest amount
of time you could think of
right now.

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:48.677
This stuff wasn't meant for you.

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:50.245
It was meant to be private.

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:52.781
So, am I supposed
to just sit here
and not act like

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:55.017
I hear every one
of your problems?

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:58.387
You got 99 problems,
but being young isn't one.

01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:01.757
You're just jealous
because Maya and I
have a real connection.

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:03.258
I'm pretty close
with my grandpa, too.

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.461
You're more messed up
than Cynthia was,

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:08.697
and she went to
the school shrink
three times a week.

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:10.866
Why?
I don't know.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:12.701
But he gave her
a ton of pills
and shit.

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:15.103
Maybe he could
give you something
for your weird old face.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.105
Okay.

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:22.444
Hey.
You're late.

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:25.247
No, actually,
I was busy with
the investigation.

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:30.185
This is Cynthia's
therapist's office.
This is our investigation.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:32.721
(WHISPERING) All right.

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.064
Watch the door.

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:45.300
Oh, is that all I'm good for?
Just watching a fucking door?

(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:48.837
Got it.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.908
Patient exhibits
drug-induced paranoia.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.343
Believes her life is in danger.

Hey.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.851
I wasn't told that I had
a 9:00 A.M. session.

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.720
Yeah, no,
we're your 9:00 A.M.
that's us.

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:07.322
And we're cured.

Thank you very much.
You're an amazing doctor.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.727
Please. You think
you're the first partners

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:16.565
only to try to run
when you're first faced
with talking with me?

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:17.999
How the fuck did you know
we were partners?

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:19.768
He doesn't know we're partners.

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:21.503
(WHISPERING) I suspect
you're partners.

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:24.172
A relationship is something
that requires constant work.

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:25.674
Which is what I thought
we learned in high school.

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:27.642
So you are
high school sweethearts.

01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:28.844
I picked up on that early.

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.046
Please, continue the dialogue.

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.513
Doc.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:34.516
I just feel like sometimes

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:36.017
he's not even trying anymore.

01:02:36.019 --> 01:02:38.386
Like this isn't
even worth saving.

Well, sometimes
I feel like

01:02:39.723 --> 01:02:41.356
that we should be
more like the yangs.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.058
Or maybe I should be more
like your beautiful zook.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.626
Oh, go fuck yourself!
You go fuck yourself.

01:02:44.628 --> 01:02:46.628
Okay.
You're so selfish.

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:48.497
All right.
That's a lot of fucking.
Oh, my God.

01:02:48.499 --> 01:02:52.200
Sometimes I like to
have the participants
make physical contact.

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:53.602
Why don't you hold hands?

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.003
Okay.
I'm not doing that.

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:56.872

reaching out for you.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:02.444
He won't hold my hand.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:03.612
JENKO: I'm not doing it.

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:05.013
I kind of need you to do it.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.848
He won't hold my hand.
Oh, you...

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.316
You got to interlock it, though.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:09.684
If you don't interlock it,
it's not hand-holding.

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:11.253
Fine.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:12.420
We might as well just be friends

and not partners.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:14.457
Nice, right?

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.392
Okay, you see this?
This is strong.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:19.628
What I want to be
able to have is this.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:22.297
Is this...

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:26.101
I want to be
able to have that,
that same thing, in, like

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:28.270
without actually
having to do it.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.471
Are you embarrassed
of your partner?

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:30.906
No, not at all. Okay?

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:32.674
And why the fuck
are you guys
ganging up on me?

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:33.875
Gang up on him.
Okay, seriously.

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:35.644
Okay, okay.
He's clingy.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.913
He literally is terrified
of being by himself.

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.514
Look, I know zook's your buddy

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:40.415
and you don't
want him to be guilty,

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:41.883
but he's our guy.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:43.819
No, he's actually
not our guy.
I would know.

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:46.354
Now, you know,
we sometimes cling to things

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:48.456
because they're
familiar and comfortable.

01:03:48.458 --> 01:03:50.192
I teach about
a principle called embedding.

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.726
Look at the facts.
Matter of fact, I...

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:54.296
Zook has the tattoo.
He knew Cynthia.

01:03:54.298 --> 01:03:55.597
I know the first time
he met you,

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:56.898
you dropped a fucking
sandwich on his foot

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.300
and he smiled at you,

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:01.369
but you are completely
blind to the fact...

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:03.305
What'd you say
embedding was?
Embedding?

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:06.775
Oh, embedding
is our tendency
to latch on to

01:04:06.777 --> 01:04:09.277
the first bit
of information
that we're offered

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:11.913
and overlooking,
or even ignoring,
contradictory information.

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:12.814
It's a fascinating principle...

01:04:12.816 --> 01:04:14.583
Shut up. I'm thinking.

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:17.953
You think it's possible that

01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:19.788
we embedded?

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.423
What, like when we were
drunk or something?

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.325
We embedded
each other?
Okay. I'm gonna recommend...

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:24.092
Okay, you can leave the room.

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:25.160
Just get the fuck out.

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:27.462
Get the fuck out.
You heard him.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:28.763
This took a turn.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:30.265
One, two...

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.033
Okay. Yep.
Good session.

this guy's the dealer.</i>

and thought has been
based on that fact,

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.109
but what if dickson was wrong?

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:43.545
And we've ignored
all the other clues.

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.849

really, really important
to tell you about.

the shit out of it.

Do you see that?

01:23:27.903 --> 01:23:31.705

I framed my psych prof just
for giving me a b-minus.

so don't fuck with me.

are you doing?
Be quiet.

like cocaine,
heroin and...

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:47.388

really your entire plan?

Coming in here with no backup?

01:25:16.178 --> 01:25:19.213
Or maybe we had a far
more elaborate plan.
Mmm-hmm.

01:25:19.215 --> 01:25:21.548
Maybe my partner has
a tracking device in
his pocket right now.

01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:22.783

01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:24.451

I don't have it.

person. You do the
tracking device shit.

That's your domain.
I do the physical shit.

I may drag you down
sometimes,

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:34.862
but every possible time
you can do something dumb,

01:25:34.864 --> 01:25:36.330
you do the dumbest
possible thing.

01:25:36.332 --> 01:25:37.998
No, the fucking
dumbest possible thing

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.833
is letting two cops
blah-blah-blah

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:42.402
while other cops are
getting in position
to bust their shit in.

01:25:42.404 --> 01:25:44.071
Oh, so you mean I brought
the tracking device.

01:25:44.073 --> 01:25:46.140
Yeah.
What's up now, huh?

01:25:46.142 --> 01:25:47.674

such a real argument.

01:30:39.501 --> 01:30:41.181
you would hit me and
not feel bad about it.

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.571
Okay.
Bring it!

01:30:44.573 --> 01:30:46.106
I'm ready.

01:30:46.108 --> 01:30:47.641
It's on now, dawg.

Oh. Oh.
Oh, my God.

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:55.415
Is there blood in my eye?
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

01:30:55.417 --> 01:30:56.850
I think there's blood in my eye.

01:30:56.852 --> 01:30:58.452
Fucking learn how to hit!

01:30:58.454 --> 01:30:59.454
(GRUNTS)

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.088
That's a little better!

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:04.210
That's a little better,
motherfucker!
Come on! Come on!

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:09.963
No! No!
What?

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.898
What were you doing?
What am I doing?

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.166
Why'd you try to kiss me?

01:31:13.168 --> 01:31:14.334
I didn't fucking
try and kiss you!

01:31:14.336 --> 01:31:16.536
Yes, you did.
Ooh, you're so weird!

01:31:16.538 --> 01:31:18.371
You're fucking
Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing me.

01:31:18.373 --> 01:31:19.873
I'm not
Mr. and Mrs. Smith-ing you.

01:31:19.875 --> 01:31:21.241
This wasn't a sexy fight.

01:31:21.243 --> 01:31:23.543
Oh, like you haven't
wanted to kiss me
the whole time.

01:31:23.545 --> 01:31:25.879
I never once wanted to kiss you!

01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:27.747
Never! No!

01:31:27.749 --> 01:31:28.849
You just did it again!
Stop it!
Stop!

01:31:28.851 --> 01:31:30.383
You're making a face
that is sexy!

01:31:30.385 --> 01:31:32.185
I don't even want to kiss you!

01:31:32.187 --> 01:31:33.553
Then stop trying!

01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:34.988
You keep trying!

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:36.623
I've never tried to kiss you.

01:31:36.625 --> 01:31:37.557
You gave me kiss me eyes.

01:31:37.559 --> 01:31:38.959
No, I didn't.

01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:40.794
The eyes were
I just got punched
in the face eyes.

01:31:40.796 --> 01:31:42.062
They weren't kiss me eyes.

01:31:42.064 --> 01:31:43.296
I don't even like you!

01:31:43.298 --> 01:31:45.065
Neither do I,
so stop kissing me!

01:31:45.067 --> 01:31:46.199
Okay!

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:49.202
No! You're leaning
in again!

01:31:49.204 --> 01:31:50.737
I didn't know
if we were gonna
punch or kiss!

01:31:50.739 --> 01:31:52.239
You're making this
so uncomfortable.

01:31:52.241 --> 01:31:55.108
This is the most
uncomfortable fistfight
I've ever been in.

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:56.643
I'm gonna give you
an out by punching
you in the face.

01:31:56.645 --> 01:31:58.111
Okay?
Okay.

01:31:58.113 --> 01:31:59.813
And then we're gonna
go back to fighting

01:31:59.815 --> 01:32:01.081
and we'll pretend
this never happened,

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:02.148

It's plastic.

Doesn't even hurt!
Okay...

01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:07.541
This isn't
the spring break
you imagined?

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.115
How about this?
You want a little fun?

01:33:09.117 --> 01:33:10.216
What is that?

Lube on my face.

You're so violent!

01:33:22.731 --> 01:33:24.831
Get off me unless
you're gonna fuck me!

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:26.099
I'm not gonna fuck you!

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:27.767
Are we gonna fuck?
No, we're not!

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:29.035
Is that what's happening?

01:33:29.037 --> 01:33:30.637
No! I'm not gonna
fuck you, ever!

01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:32.072

Choke me with your
liver-spotted hands?

01:33:48.657 --> 01:33:50.423
You gonna push me over
with your Walker?

01:33:50.425 --> 01:33:52.025
I'm impressed you
caught up to me.

01:33:52.027 --> 01:33:53.326
You probably
haven't run that fast

01:33:53.328 --> 01:33:54.794
since you played
stickball in the field

Now who's the damsel

Well, I guess it's him.

I don't have
a clean shot, schmidt.

01:34:06.942 --> 01:34:08.208
Then don't take the shot!

01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:10.276
Maybe I want to
take a dirty shot.

01:34:10.278 --> 01:34:12.412
Kind of like the dirty shot
you took on my daughter.

01:34:12.414 --> 01:34:15.649
I didn't take a dirty shot
on your daughter, okay?

01:34:15.651 --> 01:34:18.385

each other.

Don't take the shot.
