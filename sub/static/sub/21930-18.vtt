WEBVTT

00:02.056 --> 00:04.670
But why do they still call
Batman using the Bat-Signal?

00:04.770 --> 00:06.837
Wouldn't it just be, like,
easier to text him?

00:06.839 --> 00:09.073
The Bat-Signal isn't
just to alert Batman,

00:09.075 --> 00:11.342
it's also to strike fear
in the hearts of his enemies

00:11.344 --> 00:12.676
and let them know
he's coming.

00:12.678 --> 00:15.713
Sort of like Sheldon's knock.

00:15.715 --> 00:19.717
Comparing me to Batman?
I'll take it.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.585
If we don't do anything,

00:21.587 --> 00:23.721
how long do you think
they'll talk about Batman?

00:23.723 --> 00:28.359
Well, I've know them
for 11 years, so... 11 years.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.395
I believe they do text him.

00:31.397 --> 00:33.864
The-the Bat-Signal is linked
to his phone via Bluetooth.

00:33.866 --> 00:35.399
Has that been
in the comics?

00:35.401 --> 00:37.434
No, it's just what I believe.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.271
All right, I'm putting
a stop to this.

00:40.273 --> 00:43.474
If you knew how,
why'd you wait 11 years?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.309
Hey, guys, guess what?

00:45.311 --> 00:49.313
Today at work, I found out
I am going to meet Bill Gates.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.217
Sorry, Leonard,
you and Penny had a good run.

00:54.086 --> 00:56.020
I'm not leaving him
for Bill Gates.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.456
You sure? I-I bet
his Internet's really fast.

00:59.458 --> 01:01.158
How did this happen?

01:01.160 --> 01:03.060
Well, his foundation
is looking to partner

01:03.062 --> 01:05.829
with a pharmaceutical company to
help develop affordable vaccines

01:05.831 --> 01:07.498
so they asked me
to show him around.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.533
That's great.
When's he coming?

01:09.535 --> 01:12.202
Uh, he gets in on Sunday,
and Monday morning,

01:12.204 --> 01:13.837
I'm gonna give him a tour
of the labs and offices.

01:13.839 --> 01:17.908
Oh. He gets in
on Sunday, April first?

01:17.910 --> 01:20.477
Nice try, Penny.

01:20.479 --> 01:22.880
What're you
talking about?

01:22.882 --> 01:24.248
April Fools' Day.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.916
This is another one
of your classic pranks

01:25.918 --> 01:27.551
you try to pull on me
every year.

01:27.553 --> 01:30.554
Literally never
pulled a prank on you.

01:30.556 --> 01:32.089
Oh, really?
What about last year,

01:32.091 --> 01:34.525
when you sent me that e-mail
with the photo attached,

01:34.527 --> 01:36.627
but you didn't attach a photo.

01:36.629 --> 01:38.362
That was a mistake.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.431
Messing with me? Yes, it was.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.533
And this year,

01:42.535 --> 01:43.667
I am not falling for it.

01:43.669 --> 01:46.437
Sheldon, I swear...
No... what are you doing?

01:46.439 --> 01:49.073
Oh, you're right. He's
not coming. April fools.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.108
You know
what they say,

01:51.110 --> 01:52.610
fool me "N" times,

01:52.612 --> 01:54.945
where "N" equals the amount of
times you've already fooled me,

01:54.947 --> 01:56.213
shame on you.

01:56.215 --> 01:59.783
Fool me "N" plus one times,
shame on me.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.721
So you're gonna
spend a day

02:27.723 --> 02:29.957
with Bill Gates.
I'm a little jealous.

02:29.959 --> 02:31.391
Well, I'm a little nervous.

02:31.393 --> 02:33.527
You know, if I do a good job,
I'm hoping they'll consider me

02:33.529 --> 02:35.395
for a PR position
that's opening up.

02:35.671 --> 02:38.405
Well, if you're nervous,
I-I know a lot about him.

02:38.407 --> 02:42.109
I can fill you in
or maybe come along, whatever.

02:42.111 --> 02:44.678
I think I'll be okay.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.513
Well, I'm-I'm just saying,
what are you gonna do

02:46.515 --> 02:48.349
when he wants to talk about
high-level language interpreters

02:48.351 --> 02:49.717
for microcomputers?

02:50.038 --> 02:53.472
What are high-level language
interpreters for microcomputers?

02:53.474 --> 02:55.241
A way of programming computers

02:55.243 --> 02:57.343
using words and commands
instead of binary code.

02:57.345 --> 03:00.012
Oh. That's actually kind of
interesting. Tell me more.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.147
Oh, well...

03:01.149 --> 03:03.749
That, I'll do that. Mm-hmm.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.385
- I didn't even see it coming.
- Yeah, well...

03:06.387 --> 03:09.522
You never do.

03:09.524 --> 03:12.258
Well, i-it's just,
he's an idol of mine

03:12.260 --> 03:14.627
and I would love the chance
to hang out with him.

03:14.629 --> 03:15.995
Look, I know you
want to meet him,

03:15.997 --> 03:17.763
but I can't turn this
into a social thing, okay?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.899
This is my job.
I really need it to go well.

03:19.901 --> 03:22.735
I get it, I get it.
You're right.

03:22.737 --> 03:25.004
Actually, I've-I've already
met him once before.

03:25.006 --> 03:27.373
He gave a talk at Princeton
and my mom took me.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.241
Oh, really?
Was he nice?

03:29.243 --> 03:30.576
He's super nice.

03:30.578 --> 03:34.080
I-I got pretty emotional
and started crying and...

03:34.082 --> 03:36.782
He didn't make fun
of me or anything.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.317
Well, you were a kid.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.924
Uh-huh.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.763
Bye, my babies,
I love you.

03:50.765 --> 03:53.733
We love you, too, Mommy.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.301
Yeah, don't do that.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.236
Bernadette?

03:58.406 --> 04:01.974
Hi. Where you off to?
<i>El parque.</i>

04:01.976 --> 04:03.442
<i>El parque?</i>

04:03.444 --> 04:07.179
I'm learning Spanish so I can
talk to the other nannies.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.448
How's that going?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.784
<i>Bueno.</i>

04:11.786 --> 04:12.885
Good?

04:12.887 --> 04:16.389
Oh...

04:16.391 --> 04:18.624
<i>No bueno.</i>

04:23.197 --> 04:25.264
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problem.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.599
Can I get you anything?

04:26.601 --> 04:28.367
Juice box? 'Naners?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.102
'Naners?

04:30.104 --> 04:32.104
Sorry. Mom brain.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.340
I think I've forgot how
to talk to grown-ups.

04:34.342 --> 04:37.109
I meant Ba-naners.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.145
You know what, I'm good.

04:39.147 --> 04:40.446
Okay.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.314
So, what are we watching?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.583
<i>Bob the Builder.</i>
I'll catch you up.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.819
That one's Bob.

04:46.821 --> 04:48.988
He's a builder.

04:48.990 --> 04:51.824
Isn't this a kids show?

04:51.826 --> 04:54.560
It's what we watch
in this house.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.595
<i>Bob the Builder,</i>
<i>Dinosaur Train,</i>

04:56.597 --> 05:00.533
and <i>Peppa Pig,</i> which is
both funny and meaningful.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.804
You want to take a break and
maybe get something to eat?

05:04.806 --> 05:06.839
Sure.

05:08.943 --> 05:11.243
Why does it not feel like
we're going?

05:11.245 --> 05:15.548
Hang on, I-I just want
to see if Bob can fix it.

05:15.550 --> 05:18.150
Yes, he can!

05:22.457 --> 05:23.723
Oh, hey.

05:23.725 --> 05:27.660
I folded your laundry
for you. You're welcome.

05:27.662 --> 05:29.862
Uh, that's not mine.

05:33.301 --> 05:35.301
You're saying that these
aren't yours?

05:39.841 --> 05:41.574
No.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.781
So you're saying
that I'm touching

05:48.783 --> 05:50.616
a stranger's underpants?

05:50.618 --> 05:52.351
Yes.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.829
And just like that,
it's the worst day of my life.

06:03.831 --> 06:07.666
Wait, why are you being so weird?

06:07.668 --> 06:11.137
It occurred to me that perhaps
you were telling the truth

06:11.139 --> 06:14.473
about Bill Gates and it wasn't
just part of an elaborate prank.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.609
What would the
prank part even be?

06:16.611 --> 06:20.412
I show up to meet Bill Gates
over your "objections,"

06:20.414 --> 06:22.148
but it's not
Bill Gates at all, no.

06:22.150 --> 06:24.150
It's one of those look-alikes
that you hire for a party.

06:24.152 --> 06:25.851
And then when
I go around

06:25.853 --> 06:27.753
showing everybody
the balloon animal

06:27.755 --> 06:31.323
that "Bill Gates" made for me,
I'll look like an idiot.

06:31.325 --> 06:35.661
Have you been eating
laundry detergent?

06:35.663 --> 06:38.364
I just need you
to tell me the truth.

06:38.366 --> 06:39.865
This is driving me crazy.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.700
Sheldon, he is really coming.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.035
Is he?
He is.

06:43.037 --> 06:44.937
Really?
Yeah.

06:46.207 --> 06:48.474
Well, now I don't know
what to believe!

06:50.978 --> 06:52.912
Thanks for getting me
out of the house.

06:52.914 --> 06:54.914
I feel like my brain
is turning to mush.

06:54.916 --> 06:56.015
Happy to help.

06:56.017 --> 06:58.551
Did I show you the video
of the kids sitting?

06:58.553 --> 07:02.822
Yes, you texted it to me
at 3:00 a.m.

07:02.824 --> 07:06.125
Thought someone was either
in jail or dead.

07:06.127 --> 07:08.260
I'm sorry.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.029
No, no, i-it gave me
something to watch

07:10.031 --> 07:12.231
while I tried
to go back to sleep.

07:12.233 --> 07:15.201
You know what? I don't want
to be one of those moms

07:15.203 --> 07:16.902
who can only talk
about her kids.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.638
Okay, well, I'm reading
a pretty good book.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.509
It's the untold story of female
artists during the Renaissance.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.477
Oh, I'm in the middle
of a book, too.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.547
It's three pages long
and floats in the bath.

07:28.549 --> 07:32.551
All right, we can talk
about something else.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.653
It also quacks
when you squeeze it.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.656
You should've seen Michael
laugh. I think I have a video.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.626
Or maybe we can't.

07:44.899 --> 07:48.467
Why is your screen name
"JohnWilliams"?

07:48.469 --> 07:51.337
Uh, because I always score.

07:54.175 --> 07:56.809
Hey, I think I'm gonna head to
the office for a little bit.

07:56.811 --> 07:58.143
On a Sunday?
Yeah.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.212
Want to make sure
I'm prepared for tomorrow.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.514
Do you think you could
get Bill Gates

08:02.516 --> 08:04.049
to sign something for me?

08:04.051 --> 08:05.317
Yeah, maybe, like what?

08:05.319 --> 08:08.454
Oh, my arm, my chest, his call.

08:08.456 --> 08:11.123
His call will be to the police.

08:13.227 --> 08:16.161
Penny, remember when
I introduced you

08:16.163 --> 08:18.097
to 100 calorie Dove bars

08:18.099 --> 08:21.433
and you said you owed me,
like, big-time?

08:21.435 --> 08:23.068
Guys, even if I wanted
to introduce you,

08:23.070 --> 08:24.503
there is no room
in his schedule.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.105
I mean, look.
Look at this itinerary.

08:26.107 --> 08:28.274
I meet him at his hotel
first thing tomorrow morning,

08:28.276 --> 08:30.309
then we're on the go
all day long.

08:30.311 --> 08:31.877
You're right.
Guys, this is her job.

08:31.879 --> 08:32.945
We need to respect that.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.246
Thank you, honey.
Proud of you.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.715
Love you.

08:38.785 --> 08:42.888
I totally just saw
what hotel he's staying at.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.124
What are we waiting
here for?

08:45.126 --> 08:46.392
For Penny to walk
down the stairs,

08:46.394 --> 08:48.127
get in her car, and drive away.

08:48.129 --> 08:49.862
Right, smart.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.329
Is that long enough?
She's pretty quick, let's go.

09:03.985 --> 09:06.319
What would you do
if you had a billion dollars?

09:06.321 --> 09:08.254
Same as Bill Gates,

09:08.256 --> 09:10.523
try to make the world
a better place,

09:10.525 --> 09:13.893
but I'd do it
in a working Iron Man suit.

09:13.895 --> 09:16.596
I didn't know that came
in a boys' medium.

09:18.633 --> 09:19.966
Th-This is a bad idea.

09:19.968 --> 09:21.167
Maybe we should go.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.902
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

09:22.904 --> 09:24.404
I'm just feeling guilty,

09:24.406 --> 09:26.873
like I'm kind of sneaking around
behind Penny's back.

09:26.875 --> 09:28.374
We're not doing
anything wrong.

09:28.376 --> 09:30.176
We're just hanging out
in a hotel lobby.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.844
Plenty of people
do that:

09:31.846 --> 09:34.947
businessmen,
high-end prostitutes.

09:38.553 --> 09:40.520
That's a fun new game,

09:40.522 --> 09:43.556
CEO or Ho.

09:43.558 --> 09:45.925
No, this is wrong, let's go.

09:45.927 --> 09:48.327
Guys, guys, that's him.

09:48.329 --> 09:50.229
- Be cool.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:50.231 --> 09:53.032
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:53.034 --> 09:53.956
Cooler.

09:53.980 --> 09:56.152
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.940
Uh, M-Mr. Gates, I'm-I'm
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

10:00.942 --> 10:02.475
We've actually met before.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.110
Sorry, I don't remember.

10:04.112 --> 10:07.447
You were so nice, a-and
it was really special to me

10:07.449 --> 10:10.650
because you've been such
a big influence on my life.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.151
I mean, ever since
I was a little kid,

10:12.153 --> 10:14.387
I've looked up to you
like-like a hero.

10:14.389 --> 10:17.290
Oh, now I remember.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.592
Would you like a tissue?

10:19.594 --> 10:21.494
How about a hug?

10:21.496 --> 10:23.663
How-how about a tissue?

10:26.067 --> 10:28.568
Sorry I talked about
my kids the whole time.

10:28.570 --> 10:30.503
Oh, don't worry about it.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.505
I mean, besides you cutting up
my meat for me,

10:32.507 --> 10:34.874
it was a lovely lunch.

10:34.876 --> 10:37.777
God. What's happening?

10:37.779 --> 10:41.113
I'm a smart, educated,
successful...

10:41.115 --> 10:43.249
"Woman"?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.284
I was gonna get it.

10:45.286 --> 10:47.753
Don't be so hard on yourself.

10:47.755 --> 10:50.523
Pregnancy and childbirth
actually cause physical changes

10:50.525 --> 10:52.258
to the structure of your brain.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.961
I liked the old structure
of my brain.

10:54.963 --> 10:58.498
But then, I liked a lot
of my old structures.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.867
Well, these are
positive changes.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.169
Studies with rats
show that new mothers

11:03.171 --> 11:05.905
are more sensitive to danger,
better at multitasking

11:05.907 --> 11:08.908
and bolder
in the pursuit of food.

11:08.910 --> 11:12.478
I did stick a couple
lamp chops in my purse.

11:13.348 --> 11:16.082
So that's what I was smelling.

11:16.084 --> 11:19.519
Look, even though your
brain is different,

11:19.521 --> 11:21.187
in many ways, it's better.

11:21.189 --> 11:22.688
But were you bored?

11:22.690 --> 11:24.190
Of course not.

11:24.192 --> 11:25.691
You're lying.

11:25.693 --> 11:28.661
Which you can tell, because
your maternal brain is better

11:28.663 --> 11:31.464
at sensing nonverbal cues.

11:31.466 --> 11:33.332
Now you're just being
condescending.

11:33.334 --> 11:35.801
Look at you, two for two.

11:41.376 --> 11:42.542
Uh, hold the door.

11:42.544 --> 11:44.176
Hold the door!

11:49.784 --> 11:51.484
Oh. Hi, Leonard.

11:51.486 --> 11:54.253
Didn't you hear me
yell "hold the door"?

11:54.255 --> 11:56.088
I did. But you know
what they say,

11:56.090 --> 11:59.158
"hold the door,
get robbed some more."

12:00.161 --> 12:01.494
No one says that.

12:01.496 --> 12:03.195
Oh. Well, they should,

12:03.197 --> 12:06.299
because it's true,
and it rhymes.

12:07.168 --> 12:08.601
So where have you been?

12:08.603 --> 12:11.604
Actually, I met Bill Gates.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.339
I see.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.574
You're all in on it.

12:14.576 --> 12:16.876
Uh, nice try.

12:16.878 --> 12:19.145
It's not an April
Fools' joke, Sheldon.

12:19.147 --> 12:21.314
I actually went to a hotel
and met him.

12:21.316 --> 12:22.882
Right, right. Okay, so, uh,

12:22.884 --> 12:27.553
"Bill Gates" was at the "hotel"
that you "went to."

12:28.556 --> 12:30.256
Why is "went to" in quotes?

12:30.258 --> 12:31.924
Fine.

12:31.926 --> 12:35.061
So "Bill Gates" was at
the "hotel"

12:35.063 --> 12:37.163
that you went to.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.900
That's you and Bill Gates.

12:40.902 --> 12:42.101
It is.

12:42.103 --> 12:43.869
Were you crying?

12:43.871 --> 12:46.138
No.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.407
So,

12:48.409 --> 12:51.143
it wasn't a joke, and I actually
could've met him?

12:51.145 --> 12:52.645
Well, he's probably still there.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.113
What hotel?

12:54.115 --> 12:55.615
The La Quinta Inn
in Thousand Oaks,

12:55.617 --> 12:56.882
under the name Hernandez.

12:56.884 --> 12:59.218
Thank you, thank you so much!

13:01.289 --> 13:02.588
April fools.

13:07.295 --> 13:08.260
Hey.

13:08.262 --> 13:09.295
Hey, where you been?

13:09.297 --> 13:11.197
Uh, just hanging out
with the guys.

13:11.199 --> 13:12.398
They still mad at me?

13:12.400 --> 13:14.266
Uh, they were,
but then I was like, "Hey,"

13:14.268 --> 13:16.569
and they were like, "What?"
and I was like, "You know,"

13:16.571 --> 13:19.205
and they were like, "Okay."

13:20.341 --> 13:21.774
You're a good husband.

13:21.776 --> 13:23.943
Well, it's not for me to say,
but you just said it,

13:23.945 --> 13:25.144
so you're probably right.

13:25.146 --> 13:27.546
Well, as it turns out, there is

13:27.548 --> 13:29.582
a little reception
for Mr. Gates tomorrow night.

13:29.584 --> 13:32.051
I asked if I could bring you,
and they said yes.

13:35.456 --> 13:37.723
What?

13:37.725 --> 13:40.359
Yeah, you get to meet
Bill Gates again.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.962
Wait, what do you mean "again"?

13:42.964 --> 13:44.964
'Cause you met him
that one time with your mom.

13:44.966 --> 13:47.033
Yes.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.901
And then again tomorrow,

13:48.903 --> 13:52.371
for a total of two,
and only two times.

13:52.373 --> 13:55.174
Yeah. I wonder
if he'll remember you.

13:55.176 --> 13:57.977
Yeah, I wonder that, too.

13:59.147 --> 14:00.913
The sun is losing about

14:00.915 --> 14:04.216
six times ten to the 12th grams
per second,

14:04.218 --> 14:06.952
so the fraction of the mass
it loses every year

14:06.954 --> 14:09.755
is about ten
to the negative 13th.

14:09.757 --> 14:11.524
But don't worry.

14:11.526 --> 14:15.294
It'll be millions of years
before we all freeze to death.

14:20.134 --> 14:22.334
Sweet dreams.

14:24.505 --> 14:25.705
Wow.

14:25.707 --> 14:29.141
<i>Hop on Pop</i> took
a dark turn there at the end.

14:29.143 --> 14:32.344
Amy made me realize that new
mothers are cognitively primed

14:32.346 --> 14:34.814
to take in new information,
and I've been wasting it

14:34.816 --> 14:38.617
making up songs
about our babies' toes.

14:38.619 --> 14:42.521
To be fair, I cowrote
"Pinky Toe, Pinky Toe."

14:42.523 --> 14:45.357
Evolution gave me this mom brain
to focus on the baby,

14:45.359 --> 14:48.794
but I figure I can hack it to
learn all kinds of new things.

14:48.796 --> 14:50.329
Well, that's great.

14:50.331 --> 14:53.099
Yeah. There was a problem,
and I fixed it.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.869
Like Bob the Builder
in that giraffe cage.

14:56.871 --> 14:58.070
Spoiler alert.

14:58.072 --> 15:00.573
I didn't see that one yet.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.510
So that's fun.

15:04.512 --> 15:07.279
You get to meet
Bill Gates again.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.749
It's not fun, I'm screwed.

15:09.751 --> 15:12.218
It's fun for us.

15:12.987 --> 15:15.054
Maybe he won't
remember you.

15:15.056 --> 15:18.257
I snotted on his tie.

15:18.259 --> 15:21.227
Yeah, you did,
like, a lot.

15:21.229 --> 15:23.629
Hello, Leonard.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.265
Thought I'd find you here.

15:26.267 --> 15:28.100
You snake.

15:29.504 --> 15:30.569
What's going on?

15:30.571 --> 15:32.004
He sent me all the way
to Thousand Oaks

15:32.006 --> 15:33.239
to meet Bill Gates

15:33.241 --> 15:35.141
when he knew full well
he wasn't staying there.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.942
Wha-- Leonard,
that's terrible.

15:36.944 --> 15:38.277
Yeah, why would you do that?

15:38.279 --> 15:42.448
You know he's staying at the
DoubleTree in Long Beach.

15:42.450 --> 15:44.717
Aha!

15:44.719 --> 15:46.418
Wait.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.454
How do I know
you're not tricking me?

15:48.456 --> 15:51.357
We probably are.

15:51.359 --> 15:53.259
But what if we're not?

15:54.629 --> 15:56.796
You think you're so smart.

15:58.199 --> 16:02.768
You think I'm going to fall
for it again, don't you?

16:02.770 --> 16:05.337
Well, I won't.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.338
Where you going?

16:06.340 --> 16:08.207
Shut up.

16:10.711 --> 16:14.380
Aw, are you sure you can't come?

16:14.382 --> 16:16.782
I want to,
but I'm just too sick.

16:16.784 --> 16:17.883
Aw.

16:17.885 --> 16:20.286
And you really wanted
to meet him.

16:20.288 --> 16:21.554
I know.

16:21.556 --> 16:23.589
And I've been trying
to hide it so I could go,

16:23.591 --> 16:25.391
but I don't want
to make <i>him</i> sick.

16:25.393 --> 16:27.293
Yeah.

16:27.295 --> 16:30.496
Yeah, you do look
pretty pale and clammy.

16:34.569 --> 16:36.368
Yeah.

16:38.005 --> 16:39.205
Have fun.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.373
Well, feel better, okay?

16:48.182 --> 16:51.150
No, that's just my regular
pale and clammy.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.822
I mean, really, the bigger
danger isn't the loss of mass.

16:56.824 --> 16:57.957
Instead, it will
run out of hydrogen

16:57.959 --> 16:59.792
to use for nuclear fuel,

16:59.794 --> 17:03.295
swell up into a red giant,
and fry the Earth.

17:03.297 --> 17:06.665
So you don't want
to split a salad?

17:06.666 --> 17:07.665
No, thank you.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.001
But speaking
of splitting things,

17:09.002 --> 17:11.136
did you hear about the
light-splitting greenhouse film

17:11.137 --> 17:13.771
that could improve
photosynthetic efficiency?

17:13.773 --> 17:15.507
No.

17:15.509 --> 17:17.542
Just a little something I read

17:17.545 --> 17:19.811
while nursing a human being
that I made.

17:21.449 --> 17:23.147
I'm just gonna get the chicken.

17:23.150 --> 17:24.148
Ah.

17:24.151 --> 17:26.585
N-E-K-C-I-H-C:
chicken backwards.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.388
Boom, mom brain.

17:30.858 --> 17:33.058
And a whole bottle of wine.

17:35.162 --> 17:37.096
Whoa. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

17:37.098 --> 17:38.697
In your face!

17:44.805 --> 17:48.340
Hello?

17:48.342 --> 17:50.910
Aw, hey, sweetie,
how you feeling?

17:50.912 --> 17:53.045
Okay. I'm just resting.

17:53.047 --> 17:55.981
Well, I have a surprise
that might make you feel better.

17:55.983 --> 17:56.882
Oh, really?

17:56.884 --> 17:59.018
Yeah, look who's here.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.723
Wait, I know you.

18:04.725 --> 18:08.360
No, you don't.

18:08.362 --> 18:09.895
Yes, I do.

18:09.897 --> 18:12.564
You were waiting for me
at my hotel.

18:12.566 --> 18:15.034
You ruined my tie.

18:15.036 --> 18:16.435
Wait, what?

18:16.437 --> 18:17.670
What's he talking about?

18:17.672 --> 18:21.740
Uh, he, uh-- obviously,
he's kidding.

18:21.742 --> 18:23.242
That's a,
that's a good one, Bill.

18:23.244 --> 18:25.411
I got to go.

18:27.615 --> 18:30.249
Stupid Leonard,

18:30.251 --> 18:33.452
meeting stupid Bill Gates,

18:33.454 --> 18:37.589
without stupid me.

18:39.293 --> 18:42.394
Aw.

18:46.467 --> 18:49.234
I am so sorry-- Sheldon?

18:49.236 --> 18:52.404
Oh, Leonard,
I can't stay mad at you.

18:52.406 --> 18:54.306
Come here.

18:54.308 --> 18:56.475
Apology accepted.

18:57.445 --> 18:59.144
What's for dinner? I'm starving.

19:05.651 --> 19:07.484
