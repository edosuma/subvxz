00:06.006 --> 00:09.843
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.926 --> 00:14.723
You have no idea how many people
we can help with this, Grandpa.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.648
Thanks for giving it to me like that,
no questions asked.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.193
And thanks for trusting me.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.072
Just promise to be careful.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.950
It's too much cash to carry by yourself.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.370
Let Víctor take you.

00:37.954 --> 00:41.499
You don't need to explain anything to him
and I won't have to worry.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.626
Víctor!

00:43.710 --> 00:44.961
What is it, boss?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.463
Give the girl a ride.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.422
Yes, boss.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.442
What are you doing here?

01:08.610 --> 01:10.028
Are you watching me?

01:10.111 --> 01:11.654
No, I'm running an errand.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.575
It's for your own good.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.160
What?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.413
Your mother's crying for you, Víctor.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.793
She wants you to forgive her.
She only tried to protect you.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.503
You need to stay away…

01:29.631 --> 01:30.715
from…

01:48.108 --> 01:51.402
Just say, "Yes, sir" to everyone,
then bow.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.449
Do whatever the boss says
and don't talk back, okay?

01:57.408 --> 01:58.910
It's for your own good.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.711
Go back inside.

02:39.367 --> 02:43.121
Twenty-three women,
11 kids, one newborn baby.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.623
Here are their photo IDs.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.921
Gosh, Caridad! That's a lot of money.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.924
Enough for your cottage in Morelos?

02:56.217 --> 03:01.806
Sure, but so many documents together
make it a lot riskier.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.183
You know that.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.561
Julia.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.565
These women need them.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.032
All right then.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.409
Oh, girl!

03:21.492 --> 03:24.287
I'll be at the home.
Call me when you're done.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.705
Yes.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.148
I can't explain it.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.110
It's as if the guy's mother possessed me.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.656
I'm lucky you saw me, Julia.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.075
Thank you.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.118
No way. Lucky?

04:04.202 --> 04:07.872
I came to get
some of your protection stones.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.459
To protect you from what?

04:12.168 --> 04:16.923
I can't tell you that.
I promised your sister Caridad.

04:17.590 --> 04:21.177
It's so strange she didn't see you.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.930
My sister was with you?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.809
Then maybe it wasn't me
Víctor was watching.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.159
Have a nice day, Miss.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.078
Thanks.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.873
Hey, Víctor.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.208
Yes?

04:53.084 --> 04:56.170
I've forgiven you
for what you did to Manny.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.507
Grandpa says you're sorry.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.093
And if you're truly sorry…

05:04.846 --> 05:06.472
that's what matters to God.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.061
Thank you.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.325
Oh!

05:28.536 --> 05:32.457
Auntie, I'm so glad you're here.
I missed you so much.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.208
I'm glad to be here too.

05:36.127 --> 05:36.961
Sorry.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.590
Something wrong?

05:40.757 --> 05:42.091
FEDERICO: I MUST SEE YOU

05:43.176 --> 05:45.636
I am really glad to see you right now.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.513
Come in.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.182
Come in.

05:51.642 --> 05:55.355
They found traces of flunitrazepam
and ketamine in his body,

05:55.438 --> 05:57.273
which he took before dying.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.941
I MUST SEE YOU

05:59.817 --> 06:01.235
Maybe to gather courage.

06:02.904 --> 06:06.115
Maybe he gave it to his victims
and he was an addict.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.745
Dad says he confessed everything
to him that night,

06:11.245 --> 06:14.791
but the reporter's death
and all the evidence…

06:17.043 --> 06:19.754
Something doesn't add up, Fede.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.465
I couldn't care less.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.094
Dad screwed up my life enough.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.347
I can't have a normal relationship
thanks to him.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.308
Come on. You're not like him.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.601
Are you sure?

06:35.103 --> 06:38.898
Remember the girl I met in Cancún,
my Woman of Courage logo?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.360
Her name is Valentina.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.698
I'm in love with my fucking sister.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.076
What?

06:53.413 --> 06:57.041
You and your sisters deserve this house
and a lot more, honey.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.461
Rosa must be rejoicing in Heaven.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.801
Auntie, why stay with a friend
when there's so much space here?

07:08.177 --> 07:11.973
I'm only here for a few days.
Can you believe they fired me?

07:12.056 --> 07:13.141
They fired you?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.560
Yes, after 27 years.

07:16.269 --> 07:20.231
To replace me with a 27-year-old kid
who I had to train.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.319
It's for a reason.
Something better is coming your way.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.116
And you know you can count on me
for anything.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.576
-I know.
-Good.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.662
I need to go. See you later.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.666
Don't worry about me.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.376
-I know.
-Okay.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.605
Another club in the Canary Islands
was not part of the plan.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.110
There are some new opportunities
I don't want to miss.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.738
Can you do it?

08:09.655 --> 08:13.493
The authorities will be wary
of any internal transfer of funds.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.286
My name must be kept out of it.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.915
I know. Don't worry.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.047
-David.
-Yes?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.841
Do you still have a good contact
at EREDOA?

08:29.675 --> 08:33.679
And the DEA and Interpol.
That's critical to my business.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.307
What do you need?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.560
To speak with a guy at the Tenerife unit.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.397
Antonio Lozano.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.445
His daughter died of an OD.

08:50.571 --> 08:53.699
I think he'd like to know
where to find her enabler.

08:56.786 --> 09:00.915
No, those girls earned that money
by the sweat of their brows.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.543
Not precisely of their brows.

09:04.043 --> 09:04.877
Oh, Manny!

09:04.961 --> 09:06.087
Okay, Mom.

09:06.170 --> 09:09.131
They're fine, I protect them.
They make good money.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.260
And I can finally give you this money.
Come on.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.722
-You take good care of them?
-I swear.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.351
Okay. Go say hello to Carmela.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.146
Thanks, honey.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.786
I'm excited to hear what people say
about this new beer.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.665
I hope it won't get you in trouble
with Daniel.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.459
He didn't look too happy.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.046
Never mind him.
He's grumpy, but that's all.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.507
Why did they tell Beatriz he's your dad?

09:52.717 --> 09:56.804
Sorry, I heard him call you "daughter"
and you call him "Dad."

09:58.764 --> 10:02.768
Daniel is a transgender man.
He used to be my mom.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.354
But let's not talk about it.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.982
-Okay.
-How much do I owe you?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.900
How much do you owe me? Let's see.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.027
Are you sure?

10:11.902 --> 10:13.988
I don't think my son would like a--

10:14.071 --> 10:17.908
Being transgender isn't a flaw
or a disease.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.329
It's his nature and he's happy now.

10:21.912 --> 10:25.541
I'm telling you this so you won't worry
about your granddaughter.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.919
I hope I wasn't mistaken.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.504
Forgive me.

10:31.172 --> 10:35.843
My generation has a tough time
trying to understand this kind of thing.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.304
But you're right.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.891
You took a load off my shoulders.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.851
I'm happy to hear that.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.228
Okay. If you'll excuse me.

10:50.024 --> 10:53.069
Rogelio, nobody else knows.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.528
Rogelio, please.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.239
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.532
Thank you, Isabel.

10:59.033 --> 10:59.867
Good day.

11:14.548 --> 11:15.925
-Hi.
-Look.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.679
That place, The Aquarium,

11:19.762 --> 11:22.431
two of the girls I interviewed today
talked about it.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.686
It looks like they transfer some girls
from there,

11:26.769 --> 11:29.313
and… use others

11:30.314 --> 11:33.067
until they're useless.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.485
Thanks.

11:36.696 --> 11:42.243
-Need a ride?
-No. I'd rather go alone, thanks.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.994
Honey, don't be mad at me.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.330
Valentina had to mention the evidence.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.631
It hurt you the most.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.592
And you decided it with her, not me.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.305
Are you still in love with my sister?

12:04.306 --> 12:06.225
You don't know what you're saying.

12:06.308 --> 12:10.020
Yes, you're so right,
I don't know a lot of stuff,

12:10.104 --> 12:12.356
I was a naive novice a few months ago.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.400
You know what I do know?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.402
I need my space.

12:52.396 --> 12:55.941
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

13:00.362 --> 13:01.197
Grandpa.

13:02.823 --> 13:03.949
It's unbelievable

13:04.450 --> 13:07.077
that my own flesh and blood
is so talented.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.873
I know you got it from your mother,
but I'm still very proud.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.500
Thanks, Grandpa.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.794
So, when are you going pro?

13:15.836 --> 13:18.172
I guess you're working on a plan?

13:18.255 --> 13:22.384
It's funny that you mention it.
I was just thinking about that.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.431
But it's not so easy.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.268
You need money for the demo,
the producer, for your outfits--

13:31.352 --> 13:34.355
If money is an issue,
don't worry about it.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.982
I would love to help you.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.527
Nothing would make me happier.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.656
How are you guys? Good evening.
Enjoying yourselves?

13:43.739 --> 13:46.116
-Yes.
-Another whiskey?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.576
No, thanks.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.330
My doctor would smell it from here
and come to yell at me.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.208
Unbelievable.
I'll take the glass then. Enjoy.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.209
Thanks.

13:58.379 --> 14:03.008
I know Daniel would back me up,
but I'd rather tell him myself, okay?

14:03.759 --> 14:08.514
Then until it actually happens,
it stays between us.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.352
-Thanks, Grandpa.
-Okay? Another song?

14:18.023 --> 14:21.569
Turns out he was always in love with me,

14:21.652 --> 14:25.739
but I didn't know
and that's why I never told you.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.783
Why? You thought I'd judge you?

14:27.867 --> 14:32.413
You do know I should be the last person
in the world to judge you?

14:33.247 --> 14:38.586
But I just became a widow,
and people will talk, Susi.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.714
Cata, if there's one thing I've learned

14:41.797 --> 14:46.093
it's to live anyway we choose
and let people talk all they want.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.678
-Right.
-Of course.

14:47.761 --> 14:48.804
Okay.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.266
Have you told Fede?

14:53.350 --> 14:58.480
Not yet, because recently
he's been very sad.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.732
Yes, I noticed.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.320
He and Isabel are very professional
at the office,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.196
but you can tell something's wrong.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.326
Because the woman that broke his heart
did something to him,

15:10.409 --> 15:12.286
but when I find out who she is…

15:12.369 --> 15:13.787
You'd know why she did.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.164
Really?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.340
You got the message?

15:24.423 --> 15:27.051
An hour ago from a laptop
with a traceable IP

15:27.134 --> 15:30.220
to an e-mail I hardly use,
so I know it's from Ana.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.431
Look. Here's the message.

15:33.849 --> 15:34.683
Read it.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.560
"Dear brother, I'm happy here."

15:36.644 --> 15:39.396
"This reminds me
of my tenth birthday present."

15:39.480 --> 15:41.815
"Don't look for me. Love, Ana."

15:42.650 --> 15:44.401
Her present was a tiny fish.

15:45.152 --> 15:49.031
I know it's code for something,
but I don't know what.

15:49.615 --> 15:53.410
Is it a lake, somewhere near the sea?
I don't get it.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.371
-A fish?
-Yes, a fish.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.457
Jordi, Ana's at a place
called The Aquarium.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.253
Several girls who were rescued recently
mentioned it.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.505
Look.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.841
TESTIMONY FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS

16:07.925 --> 16:08.842
The Aquarium.

16:09.718 --> 16:13.055
A fish, of course.
My sister is a freaking genius.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.810
-Yes.
-She's in danger, right?

16:23.732 --> 16:27.361
I knew you were worried,
so I decided to tell you.

16:27.861 --> 16:32.074
Colonel Gaitán promised not to interview
anyone else in the family.

16:32.908 --> 16:37.121
And that none of us
is considered a suspect.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.498
What a relief!

16:40.624 --> 16:43.752
-I really felt guilty.
-You shouldn't.

16:44.753 --> 16:48.465
You did the right thing
and that's why I'm proud of you.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.300
Sorry.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.095
What's up?

16:54.430 --> 16:59.268
I can't believe that in all of Mexico City
there isn't one good CPA.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.564
Well, just keep looking.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.232
Okay. Good luck.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.027
Sorry.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.612
You do forgive me, right?

17:10.696 --> 17:11.530
Yes. Sorry.

17:11.613 --> 17:16.076
I don't mean to be nosy,
but did you say you need a CPA?

17:16.744 --> 17:17.578
Yes.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.123
You didn't have to get me a job, honey.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.167
I didn't need to say a thing.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.336
I heard Rogelio talking on the phone
by pure chance.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.590
He said Grandpa was the best CPA
he ever had,

17:29.673 --> 17:32.301
and his daughter had to be just as good.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.511
What kind of job is it?

17:34.595 --> 17:35.804
No idea, Auntie.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.141
All I know is, it's short-term,
three months or so,

17:39.224 --> 17:41.143
and he needs to see you ASAP.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.358
You can't make these decisions
without asking me!

17:48.442 --> 17:50.694
I am the company's PR officer!

17:50.778 --> 17:52.071
-I'm the owner.
-No!

17:52.154 --> 17:56.366
And it's an important event.
You never answered my messages.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.701
The owner. Right.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.581
Just let me know when it is
and I'll be an obedient worker.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.166
Forgive me, okay?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.336
Isabel, I hate to disappoint you.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.214
But these are all issues
I had in the past.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.381
Your old issues?

18:11.465 --> 18:14.343
So why don't you let me help you,
Federico?

18:16.512 --> 18:20.432
You just need to let your guard down.
All right?

18:21.475 --> 18:22.768
It's not that hard.

19:04.893 --> 19:05.727
Hello.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.399
Does your proposal
of a fun night still stand?

19:15.404 --> 19:17.030
This bill is all wrong.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.450
Don't tell me that! No news about Matilde?

19:20.534 --> 19:23.078
No. I need four beers and two tequilas.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.707
Damn it!

19:26.790 --> 19:28.709
How do you handle the taxes?

19:28.792 --> 19:31.837
I put in something and
I don't know how to go back.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.589
Only Matilde knows how.

19:38.802 --> 19:39.720
Damn it!

19:40.345 --> 19:42.097
What program is it?

19:43.515 --> 19:49.229
I'm Matilde's friend, a systems analyst.
Maybe I can help you.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.317
When were you at the bar?
I didn't see you.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.944
I wanted to see you performing,

19:56.028 --> 19:59.406
but without the pressure
of knowing I'm an agent.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.702
Your grandpa was right.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.080
You're very talented.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.041
Do you really think so?

20:09.124 --> 20:11.126
I don't say that to just anyone.

20:11.210 --> 20:16.298
I hate wasting my time.
I'm here because I'm interested in you.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.969
I want to introduce you
to a producer friend of mine.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.181
Is your schedule flexible?

20:25.265 --> 20:28.185
Yes. Yes, it is.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.311
Great.

20:29.394 --> 20:34.441
And I need you to please tell me
your whole story, everything.

20:35.192 --> 20:39.029
In this business
a good story is half the work.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.163
Is this place yours?

20:49.623 --> 20:50.457
It's all mine.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.050
Tequila?

21:00.550 --> 21:02.052
A bottle?

21:09.351 --> 21:12.813
-A bottle of tequila and two shot glasses.
-You're back, Manny?

21:13.689 --> 21:15.148
My favorite stripper.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.235
How dare you come here
after what you did to me?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.403
What I did to you?

21:19.486 --> 21:22.656
I only remember waking up
at that damn hotel.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.158
I'm not responsible
for what I can't remember.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.786
I want a private show.

21:27.869 --> 21:31.415
-I don't do that anymore. I'm the owner.
-Give me a break!

21:31.498 --> 21:35.752
-Everything okay, boss?
-Yes, the gentleman's leaving.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.341
Through the back door like the help.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.887
What the hell! Get off of me!

21:50.809 --> 21:51.643
Everything okay?

21:52.269 --> 21:54.688
Everything's fine. Drunks…

22:25.010 --> 22:25.886
I give this to you.

22:25.969 --> 22:26.928
Yes. Thank you.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.432
Where were you?
You didn't answer my messages.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.642
I was worried sick.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.269
It won't happen again.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.271
We'll talk later, okay?

22:36.855 --> 22:38.065
-Bea.
-What?

22:38.148 --> 22:41.193
This guy's tab is on the house.

22:50.118 --> 22:52.204
I just showed up at the right time.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.122
Thanks, Jordi.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.583
Let me know if you need anything else.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.877
Now that you mention it,

22:58.960 --> 23:02.297
can you see if there's a blond,
blue-eyed guy outside?

23:02.381 --> 23:03.215
Pocho.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.676
Beatriz told me about him.
Your ex-husband?

23:09.221 --> 23:12.849
Since you ask, yes,
although he hasn't signed the papers.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.477
-Can you go see or not?
-Sure.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.478
Thanks.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.025
I've never done this before.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.820
You've never kissed someone?

24:08.780 --> 24:10.323
I've never kissed a woman.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.660
Is it not the same?

24:15.078 --> 24:16.455
Desire is desire, Isabel.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.960
I'm not attracted to women.

24:23.962 --> 24:24.921
Stay here.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.071
Hello.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.656
Hello, how are you, witch?

24:51.740 --> 24:52.866
How are you?

24:52.949 --> 24:54.784
I can't focus.

24:56.244 --> 24:58.163
I'm crazy over you, witch.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.499
You're not reading my mind, are you?

25:01.625 --> 25:04.377
I can't if I have feelings for the person.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.963
Is that your way of saying

25:08.256 --> 25:10.383
you're in love with me, Miss Mai?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.138
When are you coming?

25:15.222 --> 25:17.557
You know? I need a vacation.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.519
We should hop in my car
and run away together.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.400
Fede, you're not eating
because you're not hungry

25:27.484 --> 25:29.569
or you only eat what Gracie cooks?

25:30.529 --> 25:35.033
Of course not, it's delicious.
But I had a late lunch.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.412
Isabel sends you her apologies,

25:39.496 --> 25:41.873
she couldn't make it
because her dad's sick.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.170
But she wants to take a rain check on it.

25:48.046 --> 25:48.880
Okay.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.745
What do you want now, dude?

27:43.828 --> 27:48.333
You didn't listen to me.
Matilde saw you hanging around the bar.

27:48.416 --> 27:49.834
She's my wife.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.712
You're messing with a woman with an owner.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.756
Two mistakes.

27:54.839 --> 27:59.386
Women are not property
and Matilde doesn't want to be your wife.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.098
Here are the divorce papers.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.476
Sign them and get out of this city.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.773
ARREST WARRANT

28:11.856 --> 28:14.401
I also issued an arrest warrant
in Arizona.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.528
The divorce papers are next.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.949
-How did you get this?
-Pocho!

28:22.909 --> 28:25.787
Easy, you just changed your hair
and your last name.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.624
It's a damn lie!
I never touched the woman!

28:30.125 --> 28:30.959
It's a lie.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.212
Sign next to the X.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.047
Here.

28:38.758 --> 28:42.554
If you're not gone in a week,
the Arizona cops will find you.

28:42.637 --> 28:45.849
So, start packing your bags.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.310
Have a nice trip, scumbag.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.194
Shit!

29:22.010 --> 29:23.595
Aren't you having breakfast?

29:24.095 --> 29:28.975
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
I've got some things to do.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.229
Isabel,

29:33.980 --> 29:38.318
what happened last night
doesn't make you a lesbian, or bisexual.

29:39.986 --> 29:40.904
It was sex.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.407
We enjoyed it and that's it.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.076
Manny.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.832
I have no regrets.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.085
But I have to go to the office.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.338
Okay?

30:02.884 --> 30:03.718
Okay.

30:25.198 --> 30:28.952
You know how many times
I've dreamt of waking next to you?

30:29.035 --> 30:30.036
Really?

30:32.413 --> 30:35.124
I've been thinking
I'd like to tell Federico.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.337
I don't want to keep pretending
in front of him.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.214
He'll like that.

30:41.297 --> 30:45.844
Yes, but we need to wait a bit.
He's been kind of moody lately.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.804
Hasn't he said anything?

30:49.055 --> 30:49.889
No.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.240
-See you later.
-Sure, just come back.

31:26.634 --> 31:28.386
The chief bacteriologist says

31:28.469 --> 31:31.139
he can use the samples
for a paternity test.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.018
This is so embarrassing.

31:38.980 --> 31:43.943
I have a question,
what if the people who are tested

31:45.403 --> 31:47.363
are related?

31:47.447 --> 31:50.867
I mean, how accurate is it
if they're related?

31:50.950 --> 31:54.037
Even the DNA of identical twins
is not exactly alike.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.373
If he's his dad,
there won't be the slightest doubt.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.459
Thanks.

32:08.384 --> 32:12.805
Are you going to stay every night
until we close as my bodyguard, or what?

32:13.389 --> 32:15.266
Just a few more days.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.020
I love being with you.

32:20.897 --> 32:24.150
And I think you're gorgeous.

32:26.527 --> 32:28.863
Jordi, I love being with you too,

32:28.947 --> 32:33.159
but right now I'm not looking
for any kind of relationship, okay?

32:34.953 --> 32:36.788
Look. It's your Uber.

32:36.871 --> 32:40.375
Daniel gave me your address.
He made me promise to take you home.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.418
That wasn't necessary.

32:45.505 --> 32:51.260
I know, but I'll have nightmares
if you take the subway, so I insist.

32:52.095 --> 32:52.971
Thanks.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.483
-Go get some sleep.
-Yes.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.792
At times it seemed like Rogelio
was more eager to hire me

33:22.875 --> 33:24.669
than I was to get the job.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.754
What do you have to do?

33:26.838 --> 33:29.841
Help him organize several companies.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.593
It's not difficult, just very detailed.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.762
-A toast to that.
-Cheers.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.306
Cheers to happy coincidences.

33:37.974 --> 33:42.687
There are no coincidences.
When the hell will you guys wake up?

33:52.113 --> 33:54.115
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.727
Víctor! What are you doing here?

34:22.810 --> 34:25.563
Matilde, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

34:26.397 --> 34:30.276
Yolanda phoned me about a gas issue.
I couldn't come earlier.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.694
It's late, isn't it?

34:32.445 --> 34:35.031
It's too late. Well, get some rest.

34:35.907 --> 34:36.741
You too.

34:49.545 --> 34:52.256
Stop fighting. Why do you have to fight?

34:52.340 --> 34:55.635
I know Manny doesn't.
But why don't you guys believe me?

34:56.469 --> 34:57.637
Enough, Bautista.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.568
I'm here, boss.

35:13.319 --> 35:16.572
Looks like a hungry rat.
I'll take care of it.

35:34.966 --> 35:35.800
Who are you?

35:37.885 --> 35:41.556
-What are you doing?
-I'm Víctor. I work here.

35:43.182 --> 35:44.934
I guess nobody heard you knocking.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.312
They've been fighting,
but I can let you in.

35:49.021 --> 35:51.232
-Do you want me to?
-I'd appreciate it.

35:51.315 --> 35:52.692
-Yes?
-You got a key?

35:55.153 --> 35:58.072
Yes, I do. Let's go if you want.

35:58.573 --> 36:02.160
Bautista, why do you keep
pitting us against Grandpa?

36:02.910 --> 36:07.206
I think all those visions
loosened a screw in your head.

36:07.290 --> 36:11.377
You know, I didn't trust him either,
but we were mistaken.

36:11.460 --> 36:16.090
If Rogelio wanted to hurt you guys,
he'd find another way to do it, right?

36:17.383 --> 36:18.759
It's all part of a plan.

36:19.802 --> 36:22.889
His presents, his money, Carmela's job.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.059
Even Víctor watched you
from outside Julia's shop.

36:28.144 --> 36:32.648
He went with me to the shop
and the home because I asked him to.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.447
Did you ask him to watch us too?

36:39.530 --> 36:43.201
Víctor's here because Yolanda asked him
to fix the gas.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.162
Why don't you leave the old man alone?

36:51.751 --> 36:53.753
I guess nobody heard you knocking.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.213
I can let you in.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.153
Do whatever you want.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.907
But I won't stay
to watch him destroy you all.

37:27.245 --> 37:31.082
I just hope it's not too late
when you realize I'm right.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.585
Bautista, stop it!

37:35.878 --> 37:36.921
Juana Bautista.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.006
Hysterical and stubborn.

37:56.023 --> 37:58.109
Miguel. How are you?

37:59.485 --> 38:01.946
When did you say we could go on vacation?

38:04.699 --> 38:07.493
I want to do it tomorrow.
I really need it.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.213
