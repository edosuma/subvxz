WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:06.500
NARRATOR: Mysterious stone
structures that defy explanation.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.420
Look at that.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.920
NARRATOR: Exhibiting
electromagnetic anomalies...

00:12.050 --> 00:13.880
- And you can see it's fluctuating. See it there?
- Yeah, right.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.510
NARRATOR:
That have even been linked

00:15.640 --> 00:18.310
to UFO sightings.

00:18.430 --> 00:19.430
Thousands of people
would witness

00:19.560 --> 00:21.890
these massive
triangular spacecraft

00:22.020 --> 00:24.810
congregate towards where
these chambers are.

00:24.940 --> 00:27.190
NARRATOR: And perhaps
most incredible of all,

00:27.310 --> 00:30.320
these ancient sites are located

00:30.440 --> 00:33.030
in the Northeastern
United States.

00:33.150 --> 00:36.370
WILLIAM HENRY: These mysterious
stone structures are in fact

00:36.490 --> 00:37.910
Druid structures.

00:38.030 --> 00:40.700
NARRATOR: Could an
extraterrestrial culture

00:40.830 --> 00:44.790
have existed in North America
centuries ago?

00:44.920 --> 00:47.250
BILL BIRNES: People were
not only seeing UFOs,

00:47.380 --> 00:51.710
they were seeing creatures, they
were experiencing missing time.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.300
WHITLEY STRIEBER: I have experienced
it directly for years now.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.050
It's an extraordinary place
of power.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.180
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:02.310 --> 01:05.190
in the universe.

01:05.310 --> 01:08.310
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:09.610 --> 01:12.030
It demands
we question everything

01:12.150 --> 01:14.610
we have ever been taught.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.990
The evidence is all around us.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.950
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.710
We are not alone.

01:24.830 --> 01:27.920
We have never <i>been</i> alone.

01:37.510 --> 01:39.470
NARRATOR:
New York's Hudson Valley.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.020
December 26, 1985.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.940
Author Whitley Strieber has
an experience that becomes

01:47.060 --> 01:49.860
the basis of his blockbuster
book <i>Communion.</i>

01:49.980 --> 01:53.820
STRIEBER: My wife and
I had bought a cabin.

01:53.940 --> 01:58.780
And in October of 1985,
strange experiences

01:58.910 --> 02:01.780
began to happen there
that were memorable

02:01.910 --> 02:03.370
but not understandable.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.580
And then, on December the 26th,

02:07.710 --> 02:10.539
I felt myself in motion...

02:10.669 --> 02:13.090
and woke up in the middle
of the night.

02:13.210 --> 02:16.760
And the room was filled
with these willowy figures

02:16.880 --> 02:19.760
with big black eyes,
and dark blue,

02:19.890 --> 02:21.720
short figures moving around.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.680
I assumed it was a nightmare,
and I kept trying

02:23.810 --> 02:26.890
to wake up from the dream,
and I couldn't.

02:27.020 --> 02:30.520
Then I began to hear a voice
repeating, a very gentle voice.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.360
But it was like
a mechanical voice:

02:32.480 --> 02:35.030
"What can we do to help you
stop screaming?"

02:35.150 --> 02:37.690
And I thought, "I'm screaming?"
And I was screaming.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.240
That was the beginning of it,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.490
and that's when the rest
of my life began.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.410
ANDREW COLLINS: And to this
day, he still doesn't know

02:44.530 --> 02:47.870
exactly who they were,
where they came from.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.540
Were they aliens?

02:49.670 --> 02:52.290
Were they inter-dimensional
visitors?

02:52.420 --> 02:54.040
He cannot say.

02:54.170 --> 02:57.210
NARRATOR:
Unbeknownst to him at the time,

02:57.340 --> 02:59.470
Strieber's abduction was
actually witnessed

02:59.590 --> 03:01.260
by a neighbor.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.140
STRIEBER:
After I published <i>Communion,</i>

03:03.260 --> 03:05.640
one neighbor shamefully admitted

03:05.760 --> 03:08.770
that he had seen
what happened to me that night.

03:08.890 --> 03:11.190
He and his wife had been
driving home from a party

03:11.310 --> 03:13.150
at about 2:00 in the morning,

03:13.270 --> 03:16.730
and they had seen what they
thought was the Goodyear Blimp

03:16.860 --> 03:20.110
landed in a field
near our houses.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.990
And suddenly, lights came on
all over it.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.580
He heard someone
screaming inside.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.410
His wife panicked,
and he drove away.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.410
And a year later, he said to me,
"Whitley, I'm so ashamed

03:30.540 --> 03:34.170
"to tell you,
I know it was you in there.

03:34.290 --> 03:36.960
It was a man screaming.
It had to have been you."

03:37.090 --> 03:40.800
NARRATOR: <i>Communion</i> became
a massive best seller,

03:40.920 --> 03:44.550
and ignited a cultural shift
in people's attitudes

03:44.680 --> 03:46.930
towards the subject
of alien abduction.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.350
STRIEBER:
When I published it,

03:49.470 --> 03:50.770
I thought there were,
like, maybe

03:50.890 --> 03:52.850
30 or 40 people
who had had the experience,

03:52.980 --> 03:54.560
not millions.

03:54.690 --> 03:56.230
But it was millions.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.780
NARRATOR:
But for UFO researchers

03:58.900 --> 04:01.240
and ancient astronaut
theorists alike,

04:01.360 --> 04:04.070
of particular significance
is where

04:04.200 --> 04:05.780
Strieber's encounter occurred.

04:05.910 --> 04:08.990
The Hudson Valley
stretches northward

04:09.120 --> 04:13.120
150 miles, from New York City
up to Albany.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.210
STRIEBER: This occurred
right at the western border

04:15.330 --> 04:16.750
of the Hudson Valley.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.089
The area is full of
this type of thing.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.340
And after I published <i>Communion,</i>

04:22.470 --> 04:25.550
people from the neighborhood
would come forward,

04:25.680 --> 04:28.510
one after another,
to tell me their own stories.

04:30.680 --> 04:31.930
NARRATOR:
Kent, New York.

04:32.060 --> 04:35.270
New Year's Eve, 1982.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.940
(party horns blowing)

04:37.060 --> 04:39.690
Just a few miles
from the Hudson River,

04:39.820 --> 04:43.490
New Year's Eve revelers spot
a gigantic V-shaped craft

04:43.610 --> 04:47.030
throbbing with red,
white and green lights.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.240
As they watch in amazement,
the colors vanish,

04:50.370 --> 04:52.580
replaced by white lights
so bright

04:52.700 --> 04:54.750
they illuminate the ground.

04:54.870 --> 04:58.340
Over the next months,
authorities are bombarded

04:58.460 --> 05:01.340
with hundreds
of similar reports.

05:01.460 --> 05:05.760
PHILIP IMBROGNO: Usually, UFOs just
appear to a small number of people,

05:05.880 --> 05:08.220
and they disappear.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.720
In this case, people were
stopped on the highways.

05:11.850 --> 05:14.940
People were running out
of their houses watching

05:15.060 --> 05:19.440
this enormous object pass over,
the size of a football field.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.440
BIRNES: They were so large that
people standing between trees

05:22.570 --> 05:25.110
couldn't see the ends
of the flying triangles

05:25.240 --> 05:26.240
'cause they were so big.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.570
That's how large they were.

05:30.410 --> 05:33.250
NARRATOR: The sightings continued
for more than six years,

05:33.370 --> 05:35.160
and became the most
widely reported

05:35.290 --> 05:37.120
in American history.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.710
DAVID CHILDRESS: The Hudson
Valley UFO sightings continued,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.590
well, up to 1988.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.800
It's estimated that
as many as 5,000 people

05:47.930 --> 05:50.470
called in and made reports

05:50.600 --> 05:53.930
of this very large,

05:54.060 --> 05:57.770
lit-up UFO.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.230
HUGH NEWMAN: Other accounts
are of people seeing

06:00.360 --> 06:01.690
these strange balls of light,

06:01.820 --> 06:06.360
which move around in erratic
and unusual ways.

06:06.490 --> 06:09.200
IMBROGNO: UFOs were being
seen all over the place.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.160
Pilots were seeing them,

06:11.280 --> 06:13.290
police officers were
chasing them.

06:13.410 --> 06:15.410
It was like something
out of a movie.

06:15.540 --> 06:19.290
NARRATOR: But why were so
many UFO sightings reported

06:19.420 --> 06:22.170
in this one particular area?

06:22.290 --> 06:23.800
Could there be a connection

06:23.920 --> 06:26.550
to Whitley Strieber's
abduction experience?

06:26.670 --> 06:30.510
The thinking is that
when you have so much

06:30.640 --> 06:32.970
UFO activity in one place,

06:33.100 --> 06:35.600
that place is going
to be significant.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.520
There's something about
that area, it seems,

06:38.640 --> 06:41.230
that is attracting the UFOs.

06:41.350 --> 06:44.190
They want something
in that location.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.860
There is a connection with
something in that location.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.530
Some have suggested
the reason why

06:49.650 --> 06:52.320
these sightings have happened
at the Hudson Valley

06:52.450 --> 06:56.700
is because they are
on top of a vortex.

06:56.830 --> 06:58.160
Now, what's a vortex?

06:58.290 --> 07:01.460
Well, there are varying opinions
of what that is.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.960
Some have suggested that
they are magnetic points

07:05.090 --> 07:08.170
that are part of the Earth's
magnetic grid.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.880
Other's have suggested
that vortexes are

07:11.010 --> 07:14.010
sort of these portals.

07:14.140 --> 07:17.930
COLLINS: What we call
"portals" are locations where

07:18.060 --> 07:20.690
paranormal phenomena
and supernatural events

07:20.810 --> 07:24.770
occur on an extremely
regular basis,

07:24.900 --> 07:27.860
and have done for many decades,

07:27.980 --> 07:30.490
if not hundreds of years.

07:30.610 --> 07:34.320
NARRATOR: Some argue that
New York's Hudson Valley

07:34.450 --> 07:36.330
and the adjoining region
of New England,

07:36.450 --> 07:40.710
America's Northeast,
may be just such a vortex.

07:40.830 --> 07:43.420
STRIEBER: There is definitely
an extraordinary place of power,

07:43.540 --> 07:45.210
the Hudson Valley.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.170
If you want to call it a vortex,
then sure it's a vortex.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.720
I'd have to be completely nuts
to say anything else,

07:50.840 --> 07:54.840
because I experienced it
directly for years there.

07:54.970 --> 07:57.430
NARRATOR: Could Whitley
Strieber's story of <i>Communion,</i>

07:57.560 --> 08:02.230
and the frenzied Hudson Valley
UFO sightings of the 1980s

08:02.350 --> 08:05.900
be just two small parts
of a much larger story?

08:06.020 --> 08:10.690
A story that begins thousands
of years before Columbus,

08:10.820 --> 08:13.610
when ancient visitors
set sail for America,

08:13.740 --> 08:17.700
bringing with them
secrets from the stars.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.540
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

08:21.660 --> 08:24.250
the hundreds of strange
stone structures

08:24.370 --> 08:27.540
that dot the area,
and their possible connection

08:27.670 --> 08:30.840
to an ancient people
known as the Druids.

08:33.090 --> 08:35.299
Salem, New Hampshire.

08:35.429 --> 08:38.809
July 9, 1975.

08:38.929 --> 08:43.140
At one of New England's most
popular archaeological sites,

08:43.270 --> 08:47.230
Mystery Hill, also known
as "America's Stonehenge,"

08:47.360 --> 08:52.280
Harvard professor Barry Fell
discovers a stone tablet

08:52.400 --> 08:55.030
with a mysterious script
carved into it.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.070
He identifies it as belonging

08:58.200 --> 09:00.540
to a writing system
called "ogham,"

09:00.660 --> 09:02.620
which was used
by the Irish Celts

09:02.750 --> 09:06.580
who lived 2,000 years ago,
and 3,000 miles away,

09:06.710 --> 09:09.460
in their traditional homeland
of Ireland.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.800
He translates the script
as meaning, "Dedicated to Bel,"

09:15.930 --> 09:17.760
the Celtic sun god.

09:17.890 --> 09:21.310
But why would there be
Celtic writing

09:21.430 --> 09:24.640
carved into an ancient
stone tablet in New Hampshire?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.520
NEWMAN: There is some
evidence that the Celts

09:29.650 --> 09:31.230
were in ancient America.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.740
The megalithic stone chambers.

09:33.860 --> 09:35.860
We have stone circles.

09:35.990 --> 09:38.280
There's stone avenues.

09:38.410 --> 09:41.280
There's also ogham writing
that's been found.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.450
And there's even some dolmens
as well.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.410
And it's all what you find
in ancient Ireland

09:45.540 --> 09:47.460
and ancient Europe.

09:47.580 --> 09:50.460
NARRATOR:
In recent years,

09:50.590 --> 09:53.090
a growing number of people
have come to believe

09:53.210 --> 09:55.920
that the Celts were present
in the American Northeast

09:56.050 --> 09:57.970
thousands of years ago.

09:58.090 --> 10:01.550
And some suggest that
these mysterious Celtic priests

10:01.680 --> 10:06.890
believed that the land possessed
a powerful energy.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.190
Did the Celts travel
to North America

10:09.310 --> 10:13.020
because of its connection
to extraterrestrial activity?

10:13.150 --> 10:16.360
Or, in coming here,
did they open a gateway

10:16.490 --> 10:19.110
that is still open today?

10:26.370 --> 10:30.330
NARRATOR:
Harvard University, 1976.

10:30.460 --> 10:33.460
Professor Barry Fell,
who discovered

10:33.590 --> 10:35.630
what he believed
to be ancient Celtic writing

10:35.760 --> 10:37.630
in New Hampshire
one year earlier,

10:37.760 --> 10:40.430
publishes <i>America B.C.</i>

10:40.550 --> 10:45.140
In it, he argues that long
before Christopher Columbus

10:45.270 --> 10:48.020
reached the shores
of the New World in 1492,

10:48.140 --> 10:51.100
America was visited
by the Druids,

10:51.230 --> 10:55.070
a high-ranking priest class
of the Celtic people

10:55.190 --> 11:00.200
who first arose in
Northern Europe around 800 BC.

11:00.320 --> 11:04.530
As evidence,
Fell points to the prevalence

11:04.660 --> 11:06.790
of strange stone chambers
scattered over

11:06.910 --> 11:10.370
large areas of the
Hudson Valley and New England.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.080
NEWMAN:
All over New England

11:13.210 --> 11:14.710
and New York state,

11:14.840 --> 11:18.510
hundreds of these
unusual stone chambers.

11:18.630 --> 11:20.930
Many of them are thought to be

11:21.050 --> 11:24.390
colonial root cellars,
where local colonialists

11:24.510 --> 11:26.430
would place their vegetables
in for storage.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.220
(leaves rustling)

11:28.350 --> 11:29.930
If they're root cellars,
if they're just for

11:30.060 --> 11:33.520
where the colonialists would
place their vegetables,

11:33.650 --> 11:36.770
then why are they so far out
in the middle of nowhere?

11:36.900 --> 11:39.820
And why were some of them
being reported

11:39.940 --> 11:42.070
by colonial people
as they moved into this area,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.700
even as far back as the 1600s?

11:44.820 --> 11:48.790
STRIEBER: There were stone
structures all over the place.

11:48.910 --> 11:51.290
But they weren't things made
by settlers because

11:51.410 --> 11:54.000
there had never been
any agriculture in those woods.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.790
You can't grow anything there.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.460
SALVATORE TRENTO: Many of
them have stone flooring.

11:58.590 --> 12:01.630
And stone is not the best
material for keeping crops.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.010
The cold seeps through
and destroys the crops.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.430
But there was something else.

12:06.550 --> 12:08.930
We've dated charcoal
that we found within

12:09.060 --> 12:10.810
many of these structures
and they date back

12:10.930 --> 12:14.020
to about 3,000 years ago.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.570
I think that the stone chambers,
which are dismissed

12:17.690 --> 12:19.570
so often as root cellars,

12:19.690 --> 12:22.610
are not root cellars.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.070
I've been in a couple
of those chambers

12:25.200 --> 12:27.620
and that is no root cellar,
believe you me.

12:29.870 --> 12:31.910
NARRATOR:
Professor Fell also noted

12:32.040 --> 12:34.750
that the chambers
accurately line up with

12:34.870 --> 12:38.540
astronomical events like
the solstice and the equinox,

12:38.670 --> 12:42.010
just like ancient Celtic
megaliths in Europe.

12:44.260 --> 12:47.850
Could Professor Fell
have been right?

12:47.970 --> 12:50.140
Were these chambers built by

12:50.270 --> 12:53.480
the ancient Druids
of Northern Europe?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.230
There's been a lot of discussion

12:55.350 --> 12:59.190
over the last century
about if these chambers

12:59.320 --> 13:02.570
are actually part of an ancient
Celtic or Druid tradition

13:02.690 --> 13:04.740
that came over from Europe.

13:04.860 --> 13:07.530
HENRY: They're virtually identical
to the Neolithic structures

13:07.660 --> 13:09.660
we find throughout Europe
that were created

13:09.780 --> 13:13.750
by the Druids for the purpose
of meditation,

13:13.870 --> 13:16.870
as observatories
of stellar phenomena

13:17.000 --> 13:21.550
and perhaps even other
more mysterious purposes.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.760
IMBROGNO:
There are all types of legends

13:24.880 --> 13:28.090
that people from Europe
came here a long time ago

13:28.220 --> 13:31.600
and explored the East Coast
of the United States

13:31.720 --> 13:33.770
from New York, Connecticut,
all the way up

13:33.890 --> 13:35.770
to Vermont and Massachusetts.

13:35.890 --> 13:41.070
And they actually built these
structures with a Druid priest

13:41.190 --> 13:44.990
and they were used
for ceremonial purposes.

13:45.110 --> 13:46.860
NARRATOR:
Did Druids visit America

13:46.990 --> 13:51.160
centuries before Columbus
and build these structures?

13:51.280 --> 13:53.540
And if so, are they connected

13:53.660 --> 13:56.410
to the Hudson Valley sightings
of the 1980s

13:56.540 --> 14:00.500
and even the abduction story
told by Whitley Strieber

14:00.630 --> 14:03.000
in his book, <i>Communion?</i>

14:03.130 --> 14:06.550
Perhaps further clues
can be found

14:06.670 --> 14:10.680
by more closely examining
just who the Druids were

14:10.800 --> 14:14.390
and who they worshipped.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.350
(wind whistling)

14:16.480 --> 14:18.690
Wiltshire, England.

14:18.810 --> 14:24.570
Summer solstice, 500 BC.

14:24.690 --> 14:27.360
As ancient Celts converge
on the megalithic

14:27.490 --> 14:30.030
stone circle known
as Stonehenge,

14:30.160 --> 14:32.620
the Sun's first rays
shine directly into

14:32.740 --> 14:34.580
the center of the monument.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.210
Like the stone chambers
found scattered

14:37.330 --> 14:38.920
throughout
the American Northeast,

14:39.040 --> 14:42.750
Stonehenge is aligned
to this celestial event.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.210
The Celts are led
by their Druid priests

14:46.340 --> 14:49.680
who are believed to communicate
with a higher realm.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.430
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK:
The Druids, history shows us,

14:52.550 --> 14:55.220
the ancient inhabitants in both

14:55.350 --> 14:57.730
the British Isles
and in Ireland.

14:57.850 --> 15:00.770
They were allegedly
an ancient priesthood.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.570
Masters of magic, science.

15:04.690 --> 15:07.400
They were political leaders.
They were judges.

15:07.530 --> 15:12.030
They were essentially the elite.

15:12.160 --> 15:16.330
Who exactly were they?
Where did they come from?

15:18.750 --> 15:21.580
NARRATOR: According to Irish
legend, the Druid priests

15:21.710 --> 15:24.290
were instructed by a race
of godlike beings

15:24.420 --> 15:26.800
who descended from the heavens:

15:26.920 --> 15:30.720
"The Shining Ones"
or Tuatha Dé Danann.

15:30.840 --> 15:34.260
TOK THOMPSON: The Tuatha
Dé Danann are probably

15:34.390 --> 15:37.850
the most important tribe
in Irish mythology.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.600
All the representations
we have that

15:40.730 --> 15:42.850
the Tuatha Dé Danann
were special.

15:42.980 --> 15:46.440
So the "Tuatha" means tribe.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.940
"Dé" means gods or divine,
so, divine tribes.

15:50.070 --> 15:52.360
Gods of the divine.

15:52.490 --> 15:54.780
According to these
ancient Irish books,

15:54.910 --> 15:57.790
the Tuatha Dé Danann
had red hair

15:57.910 --> 15:59.750
and blue or green eyes.

15:59.870 --> 16:02.210
They had magical powers.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.210
And they arrived in airships
with dark clouds.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.260
They had all kinds
of magical devices

16:14.390 --> 16:16.760
and weapons that they used.

16:16.890 --> 16:21.930
The Shining Ones had access
to strange pieces of weaponry.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.190
For example, one of them
is called the light sword.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.730
This sword made out of fire...

16:26.860 --> 16:29.650
(flames roaring)

16:31.990 --> 16:34.490
with which you could end
any battle like this.

16:36.490 --> 16:38.660
It is my opinion that those were

16:38.780 --> 16:40.950
the extraterrestrials
who imparted

16:41.080 --> 16:42.410
the first type of knowledge

16:42.540 --> 16:45.170
to the local population
of that area.

16:47.460 --> 16:50.130
NARRATOR: Are the Celtic
stories of the Tuatha Dé Danann

16:50.250 --> 16:52.170
actual historical accounts

16:52.300 --> 16:54.340
of an alien visitation
in Ireland?

16:56.510 --> 17:00.140
And if so, were these teachers
perhaps also present

17:00.260 --> 17:04.020
in the American Northeast
thousands of years ago?

17:04.140 --> 17:07.230
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.730
And they suggest
physical evidence

17:09.859 --> 17:13.440
may have been unearthed
on a quiet New England beach.

17:15.450 --> 17:16.780
Milford, Connecticut.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.450
August 19, 1922.

17:20.579 --> 17:24.500
The dean of American archeology,
Warren Moorehead,

17:24.619 --> 17:28.210
makes a shocking discovery
on the Connecticut shore.

17:28.329 --> 17:33.590
His excavations uncover the
remains of two massive giants.

17:33.710 --> 17:37.010
Their discovery sparked
a media sensation.

17:37.130 --> 17:38.800
IMBROGNO:
Warren Moorehead uncovered

17:38.930 --> 17:42.560
two skeletons
of some strange beings

17:42.680 --> 17:44.600
which were over seven feet tall.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.980
They had flat heads
and extra rows of teeth.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.280
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.820
an intriguing clue
about the giants' origins

17:54.940 --> 17:58.450
can be found in the
Native American oral tradition,

17:58.570 --> 18:02.410
which says that
the giants had red hair.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.950
COLLINS:
Red hair is something

18:04.080 --> 18:06.750
that is traditionally
associated with

18:06.870 --> 18:10.840
the Celtic peoples of Britain.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.010
So is it possible that there's
a relationship between

18:14.130 --> 18:19.010
the ancient British peoples
and these giants?

18:19.140 --> 18:21.890
NARRATOR:
If Druids came to the New World

18:22.010 --> 18:23.680
and built the stone chambers

18:23.810 --> 18:25.430
scattered throughout
New England,

18:25.560 --> 18:29.730
did they do so with the help
of extraterrestrial visitors?

18:29.850 --> 18:32.270
Perhaps further clues
can be found

18:32.400 --> 18:34.280
by more closely examining

18:34.400 --> 18:36.610
these potentially
ancient structures

18:36.740 --> 18:39.700
and the mysterious properties
they exhibit.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.080
NARRATOR:
North Salem, New York.

18:49.210 --> 18:51.960
April 2019.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.510
Seeking a link between the
Celts, Druids and the New World,

18:56.630 --> 18:59.010
ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress

18:59.130 --> 19:01.340
and British megalith expert
Hugh Newman

19:01.470 --> 19:04.260
set out to visit
one of the most mysterious

19:04.390 --> 19:06.430
stone structures in America:

19:06.560 --> 19:09.270
- Balanced Rock.
- CHILDRESS: I'm excited about

19:09.390 --> 19:11.480
seeing this Balanced Rock.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.150
And you, you think
it's a dolmen.

19:13.270 --> 19:15.270
- Is that what you're saying?
- I'm convinced it's a dolmen.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.900
It looks like something
you would find in Britain.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.320
NARRATOR:
Thousands of ancient dolmens

19:21.450 --> 19:22.870
have been found
throughout Europe.

19:22.990 --> 19:27.160
Most are known to be
at least 5,000 years old,

19:27.290 --> 19:29.250
and since rock
cannot be carbon-dated,

19:29.370 --> 19:31.040
could be far older.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.880
The dolmens were
sometimes open tombs

19:35.000 --> 19:37.960
under which a body would be
ceremonially placed.

19:38.090 --> 19:40.340
COLLINS:
This monument

19:40.470 --> 19:44.180
that is known
as Balanced Rock resembles

19:44.300 --> 19:48.270
almost exactly
the stone dolmens of Europe.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.520
NEWMAN:
It's a massive top stone.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.440
60 to 90 tons are the estimates.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.940
And it's just
a remarkable place.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.740
And so, geologists
are saying that it's...

19:59.860 --> 20:02.570
a glacial erratic
and a-a glacier just brought it.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.240
It's, it's totally natural.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.160
As the glacier pulled out,
it just sort of

20:06.280 --> 20:07.950
dropped them down
on these stones.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.910
That's what they say,
but it just doesn't make sense

20:10.040 --> 20:11.710
'cause it looks like
it's constructed.

20:11.830 --> 20:14.210
You can see the shaping on the,
the stones underneath it.

20:14.330 --> 20:16.750
NARRATOR:
Just a few miles south

20:16.880 --> 20:18.550
of the mass UFO sightings
that happened

20:18.670 --> 20:20.420
in Kent, New York in the 1980s,

20:20.550 --> 20:25.180
David and Hugh arrive
at the mysterious formation.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.100
Wow, look at that.

20:31.270 --> 20:33.440
Oh, man. That is huge.

20:33.560 --> 20:35.060
NEWMAN: That is pretty
impressive, isn't it?

20:35.190 --> 20:37.730
- CHILDRESS: That is a giant dolmen, isn't it?
- I know.

20:37.860 --> 20:39.820
- I know. It's amazing.
- Cool, wow.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.400
It looks like a European dolmen,
doesn't it?

20:42.530 --> 20:43.860
It does, it's identical.
'Cause you have,

20:43.990 --> 20:45.280
we have these uprights; I mean,

20:45.410 --> 20:46.780
there were originally
seven there.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.490
- Uh-huh.
- There seems to be five or six there.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.950
It's hard to tell
because some split.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.620
And the fact that it's granite
is quite intriguing,

20:52.750 --> 20:55.370
combined with
the gneiss rock underneath.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.170
So there is a potential
piezoelectric effect.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.130
And this site is renowned

20:59.250 --> 21:02.170
for having kind of energies
associated with it.

21:04.970 --> 21:08.010
NARRATOR: In the so-called
"piezoelectric effect,"

21:08.140 --> 21:11.640
electrical energy accumulates
in solids, rocks

21:11.770 --> 21:14.060
and otherwise lifeless matter.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.480
Some claim that objects infused
with piezoelectricity

21:17.610 --> 21:21.150
can produce strange
and anomalous results.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.990
Because this is granite,
it's infused

21:24.110 --> 21:26.610
- with tiny quartz crystals.
- Yeah.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.910
So, yeah, there should be
some energy coming out of it.

21:29.030 --> 21:32.160
I believe there is, and also,
the landscape it's in,

21:32.290 --> 21:35.830
it sits right on top
of a negative magnetic anomaly,

21:35.960 --> 21:39.670
directly under
the main part of the stone.

21:39.790 --> 21:43.010
So you think that this is
some kind of vortex area,

21:43.130 --> 21:44.720
and there's a magnetic anomaly,

21:44.840 --> 21:46.720
and that perhaps they used
that magnetic anomaly

21:46.840 --> 21:49.140
to move this giant boulder
a-and place it here?

21:49.260 --> 21:51.510
It's quite possible.
And I think,

21:51.640 --> 21:53.310
if you place them
in the right spot

21:53.430 --> 21:54.770
when there's magnetic anomalies

21:54.890 --> 21:56.600
or telluric currents underneath,
which is both here,

21:56.730 --> 21:58.980
you have
the piezoelectric effect.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.940
So when you place seeds
or grains there,

22:01.070 --> 22:02.940
it'll charge them up,
and you'll get a higher yield

22:03.070 --> 22:04.360
and a better-quality crop.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.150
CHILDRESS: Seeds that
are charged under here

22:06.280 --> 22:08.030
for one or two days,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.070
and then other seeds
that aren't charged,

22:10.200 --> 22:12.160
they grow 'em together,
and the ones from here grow,

22:12.280 --> 22:13.540
like, twice as fast.

22:13.660 --> 22:17.080
NEWMAN: This has been
tested scientifically.

22:17.210 --> 22:20.750
CHILDRESS: So, if there's some
kind of energy vortex here,

22:20.880 --> 22:22.290
- you can measure that, right?
- Yeah.

22:22.420 --> 22:23.710
So, I've got this.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.670
This is a TriField magnetometer.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.800
This is a classic device
where you measure

22:29.930 --> 22:32.510
different readings
from magnetic fluctuations.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.680
Also electric charge.
Even radiation.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.020
Well, should we do some tests?
Shall we see what we can find?

22:38.140 --> 22:39.440
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah, let's go.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.980
Okay, let's turn this on.
So what we'll do is,

22:41.110 --> 22:42.610
we'll get down a bit closer in.

22:42.730 --> 22:45.360
- Uh-huh.
- Let's put this down here, right in the center.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.690
And look, immediately...

22:46.820 --> 22:48.570
We've got it on the magnetic,
uh, setting,

22:48.700 --> 22:50.870
so we're getting
fluctuations already.

22:50.990 --> 22:55.790
CHILDRESS: So that means that
there's an anomalous energy here.

22:55.910 --> 22:59.250
Some magnetic field
that's stronger than outside.

22:59.370 --> 23:01.960
So this energy field is pulsing.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.920
NEWMAN:
This is a proper energy site.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.840
So let's just keep
walking around,

23:06.960 --> 23:10.630
see if we can pick up any other
fluctuations or readings here.

23:10.760 --> 23:15.140
And, yeah, this spot here
seems to be the-the hot spot.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.520
- CHILDRESS: It's stronger now.
- NEWMAN: It's much stronger.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.930
- It's almost double.
- Uh-huh.

23:19.060 --> 23:21.600
NEWMAN: We certainly
have an anomaly here.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.820
NARRATOR: While many rocks
naturally carry a magnetic charge,

23:26.940 --> 23:29.990
the magnetic energy under
and around Balanced Rock

23:30.110 --> 23:31.570
is unusually high...

23:31.700 --> 23:35.160
From ten to 50 times normal.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.750
STRIEBER: The great
structures of the past,

23:38.870 --> 23:40.710
like Balanced Rock,

23:40.830 --> 23:43.290
were about experiencing

23:43.420 --> 23:45.630
the great energy of the Earth.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.800
And, in fact, if you go
to Balanced Rock,

23:48.920 --> 23:53.180
you can feel the power
of the Earth there still,

23:53.300 --> 23:54.930
just as it was then.

23:55.050 --> 23:57.260
NARRATOR:
But is the rock generating

23:57.390 --> 23:59.480
all of this energy on its own?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.770
Or could it have been
purposely placed here

24:01.890 --> 24:04.520
because it is a location
that amplifies

24:04.650 --> 24:06.860
its magnetic properties?

24:06.980 --> 24:10.690
So, you're also thinking,
then, that Druids

24:10.820 --> 24:13.070
or the Tuatha Dé Danann,

24:13.200 --> 24:17.410
they've come here from Ireland
and England and Wales,

24:17.530 --> 24:22.330
and then they chose this area
because it's a vortex spot,

24:22.460 --> 24:25.330
and then they chose this spot
particularly

24:25.460 --> 24:27.710
to put this giant dolmen here?

24:27.840 --> 24:31.090
NEWMAN: I think that's the
case, and I think this is really

24:31.220 --> 24:35.640
the center of the whole complex
around this part of the country.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.930
CHILDRESS: So, back in the '80s,
there was this big UFO flap

24:40.060 --> 24:42.180
here in the Hudson Valley.

24:42.310 --> 24:46.400
And some UFO researchers claim
that the UFOs were

24:46.520 --> 24:51.240
coming up the valley
towards this rock.

24:54.150 --> 24:57.620
NARRATOR: Six years after Harvard
University Professor Barry Fell

24:57.740 --> 25:00.620
published his controversial
theory that the Druids

25:00.740 --> 25:02.790
had visited North America,

25:02.910 --> 25:06.080
the Hudson Valley UFO sightings
began right over

25:06.210 --> 25:10.210
the mysterious stone chambers
and Balanced Rock.

25:10.340 --> 25:13.220
As investigators began tracking
these many thousands

25:13.340 --> 25:15.380
of sightings
in the Hudson Valley,

25:15.510 --> 25:18.010
they began to notice that
there was a focal point.

25:18.140 --> 25:21.970
A central point: Balanced Rock.

25:22.100 --> 25:25.770
Appears to be a sort of a vortex
that was either used as a portal

25:25.890 --> 25:28.940
by these craft,
or as a guidance mechanism

25:29.060 --> 25:33.860
for these craft as they're
travelling through this vortex.

25:33.990 --> 25:37.450
It's no accident that these
masses of sightings took place

25:37.570 --> 25:39.120
in the Hudson Valley.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.540
NEWMAN: Some of the research
that was carried out,

25:43.660 --> 25:46.170
they found that some of
the balls of light

25:46.290 --> 25:49.290
which seem intelligent,
were moving towards these kind

25:49.420 --> 25:51.550
of sites, like the dolmens,
the chambers

25:51.670 --> 25:53.840
of the Hudson Valley here.

25:53.960 --> 25:58.010
NARRATOR: Does the magnetic
testing at Balanced Rock reveal

25:58.140 --> 26:01.100
that this area of the Earth
generates an energy vortex?

26:01.220 --> 26:04.310
And if so, could this anomaly

26:04.430 --> 26:07.060
be connected to both
the high number of UFO sightings

26:07.190 --> 26:09.650
in the Hudson Valley, and also

26:09.770 --> 26:12.940
the mysterious stone structures
found throughout the region?

26:13.070 --> 26:15.780
Perhaps further clues
can be found

26:15.900 --> 26:18.450
by examining an infamous site

26:18.570 --> 26:22.950
where some say time
stands still.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.670
NARRATOR:
Upstate New York.

26:29.790 --> 26:33.050
April 2019.

26:33.170 --> 26:34.630
In search of further evidence

26:34.760 --> 26:37.130
that the ancient Druids
came to America,

26:37.260 --> 26:40.300
David Childress and Hugh Newman
head to a site

26:40.430 --> 26:42.510
just 20 miles north
of Balanced Rock...

26:42.640 --> 26:46.810
One of the mysterious stone
chambers of Putnam County.

26:46.930 --> 26:50.350
There's huge boulders here,
and some walls. Well...

26:50.480 --> 26:52.060
Yeah, there's just
so many of them, really.

26:52.190 --> 26:53.820
I mean, some of them are
probably still buried,

26:53.940 --> 26:55.480
to be discovered.

26:55.610 --> 26:58.070
All right, I see a chamber
right there. Yeah.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.700
NEWMAN: I'm really looking
forward to seeing this one.

26:59.820 --> 27:00.660
CHILDRESS:
All right.

27:04.450 --> 27:08.040
Yeah, this is one of the-the
more famous ones.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.420
When we get inside,
it gets bigger.

27:12.540 --> 27:13.500
So let's get these on.

27:13.630 --> 27:14.880
Let's go in and take a look.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.510
See what we can see.

27:16.630 --> 27:18.880
CHILDRESS:
Yeah, this is a big lintel.

27:19.010 --> 27:20.880
NEWMAN: Yeah, look at this.
This is incredible.

27:21.010 --> 27:23.350
CHILDRESS:
Wow.

27:23.470 --> 27:26.100
NEWMAN:
It's well constructed.

27:26.220 --> 27:29.140
This is one of the chambers
where the strange lights

27:29.270 --> 27:31.980
would kind of congregate
during the whole

27:32.100 --> 27:35.690
- Hudson Valley UFO flap that lasted for ten years.
- Is that right?

27:35.820 --> 27:38.440
And also, we've got massive
megalithic block.

27:38.570 --> 27:41.160
Especially this stone back here.
Look at this.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.160
This is the classic sort of
British megalithic design,

27:44.280 --> 27:46.240
and it proves, I believe,

27:46.370 --> 27:48.410
a connection with the ancient
sites of Britain.

27:48.540 --> 27:52.460
This entrance, what direction
do you think that's pointing?

27:52.580 --> 27:54.840
Well, we can just check that,
actually, while we're here.

27:54.960 --> 27:57.250
If we're standing over
this side,

27:57.380 --> 27:59.550
in that direction,
it's going east.

27:59.670 --> 28:02.720
But if we go over here,
for instance,

28:02.840 --> 28:05.300
and we look in that direction,
that's like northeast.

28:05.430 --> 28:08.270
So we've got summer solstice
alignment going that way,

28:08.390 --> 28:09.730
and if you're standing
over there,

28:09.850 --> 28:11.520
we've got an eastern equinox
alignment.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.900
So, that's kind of intriguing
in itself.

28:16.190 --> 28:19.440
NARRATOR:
Based on Hugh Newman's research,

28:19.570 --> 28:22.950
the chamber lines up
with the solstice and equinox,

28:23.070 --> 28:26.490
like ancient sites all over
the former Celtic territory

28:26.620 --> 28:30.330
of Northern Europe,
such as Stonehenge in England,

28:30.450 --> 28:33.000
the Ring of Brodgar in Scotland,

28:33.120 --> 28:35.040
Newgrange in Ireland,

28:35.170 --> 28:37.630
and the Carnac Stones in France.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.670
Were the Hudson Valley
chambers constructed

28:40.800 --> 28:43.300
by the same ancient builders?

28:43.430 --> 28:46.850
And if so,
how are the chambers connected

28:46.970 --> 28:49.430
to the spectacular UFO sightings

28:49.560 --> 28:53.810
that electrified
the Hudson Valley 30 years ago?

28:53.940 --> 28:57.610
In the whole Hudson Valley
UFO flap in the '80s,

28:57.730 --> 29:00.860
we did have accounts of these
balls of light,

29:00.980 --> 29:03.200
these-these orbs coming down.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.860
They would sort of almost
orientate and kind of land,

29:05.990 --> 29:08.410
go inside the chambers.

29:08.530 --> 29:09.990
And so, why would they do that?

29:10.120 --> 29:12.620
Then it was realized they may
have been designed to trap

29:12.750 --> 29:15.620
magnetic and electric charge,
and it would attract

29:15.750 --> 29:18.290
and move these natural
balls of light around.

29:18.420 --> 29:21.420
NARRATOR: If Druids armed
with alien technology

29:21.550 --> 29:23.800
visited the American Northeast,

29:23.920 --> 29:25.840
could there be other signs
of their passage

29:25.970 --> 29:27.510
through New England?

29:31.010 --> 29:32.350
Hartford, Connecticut.

29:32.470 --> 29:35.140
November 20, 1654.

29:37.020 --> 29:40.360
A settler named John Pynchon
writes Governor John Winthrop

29:40.480 --> 29:44.360
about a newly discovered
stone site known as Gungywamp,

29:44.490 --> 29:48.780
from which he says he is hearing
"many strange reports."

29:48.910 --> 29:53.250
Gungywamp is a series
of stone chambers,

29:53.370 --> 29:56.580
alignments of standing stones
on a 24-acre hilltop

29:56.710 --> 29:58.500
in Southern Connecticut.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.750
And people have been
looking at this

29:59.880 --> 30:02.130
since the early 1600s.

30:02.250 --> 30:05.090
Gungywamp is a place of mystery.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.220
It's a place that has a lot
of anomalies with it.

30:07.340 --> 30:10.470
COLLINS: It's known for
its magnetic anomalies.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.310
It's known for
the strange lights,

30:12.430 --> 30:15.060
the UFOs that appear
in this area.

30:15.180 --> 30:18.100
People have very strange
experiences when they go there.

30:18.230 --> 30:22.570
They burst into tears,
becoming very emotional.

30:22.690 --> 30:26.190
People have reported nosebleeds
out of nowhere.

30:28.030 --> 30:30.570
Bleeding from the eyes.

30:30.700 --> 30:34.450
People have reported
passing out, feeling nauseous.

30:34.580 --> 30:39.000
I was there with a friend of
mine, and we had to sit down

30:39.120 --> 30:41.540
because we got so nauseous
and dizzy.

30:41.670 --> 30:46.590
Some have claimed
extraordinary experiences

30:46.720 --> 30:49.890
where time and space
actually are freezing.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.140
NARRATOR: Interestingly,
Governor John Winthrop,

30:57.270 --> 30:59.730
who recorded the first reference
to Gungywamp,

30:59.850 --> 31:03.020
also recorded the first report
of a UFO sighting

31:03.150 --> 31:04.270
in the New World.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.900
It occurred in 1639,

31:08.030 --> 31:10.320
100 miles east of Gungywamp,

31:10.450 --> 31:13.490
on Boston's Muddy River.

31:13.620 --> 31:16.290
He described an incident
that fishermen had,

31:16.410 --> 31:19.330
where an object flew up
out of the water,

31:19.460 --> 31:20.500
hovered in the sky...

31:20.620 --> 31:23.130
Then, all of a sudden,

31:23.250 --> 31:26.670
these fishermen were back
at the headwaters of this river,

31:26.800 --> 31:29.380
with no sense of passing time.

31:29.510 --> 31:33.550
NARRATOR:
Strange magnetic anomalies.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.180
Unexplainable physical ailments.

31:36.310 --> 31:38.180
Missing time.

31:38.310 --> 31:40.230
UFO sightings.

31:40.350 --> 31:43.810
Could Balanced Rock, Gungywamp,

31:43.940 --> 31:47.530
and the stone chambers be part
of a larger "energy grid"

31:47.650 --> 31:51.320
that overlies vast swaths of the
Hudson Valley and New England?

31:51.450 --> 31:54.660
One that contributes
to the creation of a vortex?

31:54.780 --> 32:00.290
For ancient astronaut theorists,
the answer is a resounding yes,

32:00.410 --> 32:03.080
and they suggest a connection
to the Druids

32:03.210 --> 32:04.540
and their otherworldly mentors,

32:04.670 --> 32:06.670
the Tuatha Dé Danann,

32:06.800 --> 32:10.050
can be found by examining
their darkest practice,

32:10.170 --> 32:12.970
human sacrifice.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.270
NARRATOR:
Mystery Hill, New Hampshire.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.440
At this remarkable
megalithic stone site

32:26.570 --> 32:28.650
known as America's Stonehenge,

32:28.780 --> 32:31.280
where Barry Fell
first discovered evidence

32:31.400 --> 32:34.320
of Druid writing in 1975,

32:34.450 --> 32:38.030
can be found numerous
celestial alignments.

32:38.160 --> 32:42.290
NEWMAN: It's an area
that covers 12 acres.

32:42.410 --> 32:44.170
It has multiple stone chambers.

32:44.290 --> 32:46.250
It has megalithic construction,

32:46.380 --> 32:49.380
such as standing stones,

32:49.500 --> 32:51.920
which have now been found
to be astronomically aligned

32:52.050 --> 32:53.880
from the center of the site.

32:54.010 --> 32:57.470
NARRATOR: The most famous
artifact at Mystery Hill

32:57.600 --> 33:00.430
is a curious stone slab.

33:00.560 --> 33:04.900
COLLINS: Among the many stone
structures at America's Stonehenge

33:05.020 --> 33:08.320
is a huge, flat slab

33:08.440 --> 33:12.320
that is the size
of a human body.

33:12.440 --> 33:16.660
And around its edges
is a channel

33:16.780 --> 33:18.410
that leads into a hole

33:18.530 --> 33:23.750
that very clearly would've been
used to catch liquid

33:23.870 --> 33:28.670
that was running down the stone
and that would eventually go

33:28.790 --> 33:31.250
through the channel
down into the ground.

33:31.380 --> 33:36.510
NARRATOR: A stone slab
the size of a human body?

33:36.640 --> 33:39.760
With a channel
for catching liquid?

33:39.890 --> 33:43.520
Could this slab have been used
for blood rituals?

33:43.640 --> 33:48.730
The stone has, in fact, been
dubbed "The Sacrificial Table,"

33:48.860 --> 33:53.030
and some researchers believe
it was used by the Druids.

33:53.150 --> 33:56.360
Throughout Northern England,

33:56.490 --> 33:58.740
so-called "bog bodies"
have been found,

33:58.870 --> 34:01.740
disturbingly
well-preserved corpses

34:01.870 --> 34:06.080
of 2,000-year-old
human sacrifice victims.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.330
COLLINS: Bog bodies,
as they're described,

34:08.460 --> 34:11.250
are human cadavers

34:11.380 --> 34:13.710
that have been repeatedly found

34:13.840 --> 34:16.719
in boggy environments,

34:16.840 --> 34:20.050
and the manner
of their discovery

34:20.179 --> 34:22.760
seems to suggest that they
could've been cast

34:22.889 --> 34:27.810
into the waters as a sacrifice.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.860
There is powerful evidence

34:30.980 --> 34:35.820
that those responsible for these
ritual murders were the Druids,

34:35.940 --> 34:39.570
and if the Druids
did reach North America,

34:39.699 --> 34:42.530
that they carried
sacrifice with them.

34:42.659 --> 34:46.659
IMBROGNO: The Druids did
sacrifice a certain way.

34:46.790 --> 34:49.170
They would put a noose
around the neck

34:49.290 --> 34:52.130
so that the pressure builds up
in the carotid artery,

34:52.250 --> 34:53.920
then they would slit the throat

34:54.050 --> 34:57.090
so the blood
had pressure to form

34:57.220 --> 35:02.100
a stream in the grooves
of the rock.

35:02.220 --> 35:05.560
NARRATOR:
Could the Table of Sacrifice

35:05.680 --> 35:08.390
be physical evidence that
the Druids came to America

35:08.520 --> 35:10.690
centuries ago

35:10.810 --> 35:14.480
and brought with them,
not only their dark customs,

35:14.610 --> 35:17.440
but perhaps also left
an indelible mark

35:17.570 --> 35:20.700
on New England
and the Hudson Valley?

35:22.570 --> 35:24.990
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

35:25.120 --> 35:27.450
and point out
that Balanced Rock,

35:27.580 --> 35:29.580
the Hudson Valley
stone chambers,

35:29.710 --> 35:32.580
the largest number of UFO
sightings in U.S. history,

35:32.710 --> 35:35.500
and Whitley Strieber's
famous abduction story,

35:35.630 --> 35:39.920
all happened within miles
of each other.

35:40.050 --> 35:44.140
I've had many conversations
with Whitley Strieber,

35:44.260 --> 35:48.600
and he uses the Hudson Valley
UFO sightings to give validation

35:48.730 --> 35:52.650
to his own experiences, which
occurred in the Hudson Valley.

35:52.770 --> 35:55.570
It validates his story.

35:55.690 --> 36:00.700
NARRATOR: Strieber notes that,
according to the ancient Celtic stories,

36:00.820 --> 36:03.450
the Tuatha Dé Danann,
the so-called "Shining Ones"

36:03.570 --> 36:05.620
who descended from the sky,

36:05.740 --> 36:07.910
ultimately went underground

36:08.040 --> 36:12.620
and became the fairy folk
of Irish myth.

36:12.750 --> 36:16.090
In his own extraterrestrial
abduction experience,

36:16.210 --> 36:19.210
the beings he encountered
came from below.

36:19.340 --> 36:24.010
There's a tradition
in Celtic folklore that

36:24.140 --> 36:27.390
the old gods
retreat underground.

36:27.510 --> 36:30.890
I think they came up,
and those people who came up

36:31.020 --> 36:35.810
were real, just as real
as you and me.

36:35.940 --> 36:40.610
So maybe there is something
to the old fairy lore.

36:40.740 --> 36:43.910
Let me put it this way,
and we mustn't forget this,

36:44.030 --> 36:48.580
these fairy folk had nothing
to do with Tinker Bell.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.580
They're really a serious bunch.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.290
NARRATOR: Is there an
extraterrestrial presence

36:56.420 --> 36:58.960
that has existed
in the American Northeast

36:59.090 --> 37:01.170
for more than 2,000 years?

37:01.300 --> 37:05.970
If so, is this what brought
the Druids to this area?

37:06.090 --> 37:09.760
Or might the Druids themselves
have been responsible

37:09.890 --> 37:13.560
for opening the door
to otherworldly visitors?

37:13.690 --> 37:16.520
Perhaps further clues
can be found

37:16.650 --> 37:20.110
in another eerie similarity
between ancient Druid legends

37:20.230 --> 37:24.240
and the testimony
of today's abductees:

37:24.360 --> 37:27.910
The strange phenomenon
of missing time.

37:33.620 --> 37:35.540
NARRATOR: More than 30
years after the publication

37:35.670 --> 37:37.290
of his book <i>Communion,</i>

37:37.420 --> 37:40.040
author Whitley Strieber
remains convinced

37:40.170 --> 37:41.920
of a profound connection

37:42.050 --> 37:45.260
between his abduction and
the mysterious stone chambers

37:45.380 --> 37:47.090
that dot the Hudson Valley.

37:47.220 --> 37:50.760
STRIEBER:
You sit in one of these chambers

37:50.890 --> 37:56.140
that's been carefully aligned
to the earth and to the sky,

37:56.270 --> 38:00.020
and you will communicate
with other levels of reality

38:00.150 --> 38:02.940
to the point that you
will actually bring

38:03.070 --> 38:06.400
physical entities
into your presence.

38:06.530 --> 38:10.780
And you knew then the land
is terribly sacred.

38:10.910 --> 38:13.620
NARRATOR:
Could these structures

38:13.750 --> 38:15.460
and Strieber's
strange encounter,

38:15.580 --> 38:17.830
point to an
extraterrestrial influence

38:17.960 --> 38:21.500
dating back to the age
of the ancient Druids?

38:21.630 --> 38:25.050
Perhaps one final key
can be found in famous tales

38:25.170 --> 38:27.180
of lost and missing time

38:27.300 --> 38:29.840
for which this region
of the world is famous,

38:29.970 --> 38:34.220
and which played a major role
in <i>Communion.</i>

38:34.350 --> 38:36.390
STRIEBER: Like many close
encounter witnesses,

38:36.520 --> 38:39.600
I have missing time
in my experience.

38:39.730 --> 38:41.730
It's not like going to sleep.

38:41.860 --> 38:44.900
It's as if you and I
are sitting here talking,

38:45.030 --> 38:48.530
I sense no change whatsoever,
and then I discover

38:48.660 --> 38:51.370
that I've actually been here
for over an hour

38:51.490 --> 38:53.580
in what seemed to me
like five minutes.

38:55.450 --> 38:56.870
NARRATOR:
Missing time plays a role

38:57.000 --> 39:00.040
in many modern reports
of alien abductions,

39:00.170 --> 39:02.590
but when it comes
to the Hudson Valley,

39:02.710 --> 39:06.090
stories of missing time
go back centuries.

39:06.210 --> 39:10.090
200 years ago,
Washington Irving published

39:10.220 --> 39:14.260
America's most famous tale
of lost time, <i>Rip Van Winkle.</i>

39:14.390 --> 39:17.680
It's the story of
a Dutch American colonist

39:17.810 --> 39:21.730
who takes a nap in the woods
and wakes up 20 years later.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.900
Curiously, it's set in a village

39:25.020 --> 39:28.400
just a few miles away
from Strieber's cabin.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.950
And Irving's
<i>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i>

39:31.070 --> 39:34.910
takes place in the real village
of North Tarrytown, New York,

39:35.030 --> 39:37.750
just a few miles
from Balanced Rock.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.540
STRIEBER:
I think that Washington Irving

39:40.670 --> 39:42.380
sensed something up there,
clearly.

39:42.500 --> 39:46.500
He was very sensitive to what
was going on in that area,

39:46.630 --> 39:49.550
what is going on to this day
in that area, in my opinion.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.930
THOMPSON: The well-known,
uh, <i>Rip Van Winkle</i> story,

39:53.050 --> 39:54.970
uh, that was put
into literary form,

39:55.100 --> 39:59.100
uh, by Washington Irving is, uh,
kind of a fascinating story

39:59.230 --> 40:02.350
because even though
it seems to be American,

40:02.480 --> 40:06.980
it's really lifted directly out
of the Celtic fairy tradition.

40:10.780 --> 40:14.820
NARRATOR: If the ancient Druids came
to America thousands of years ago,

40:14.950 --> 40:18.290
were they attracted
by an alien presence?

40:18.410 --> 40:20.290
Or is it possible that they used

40:20.410 --> 40:22.540
their vast and mysterious
knowledge,

40:22.670 --> 40:25.340
that allowed them to harness
the electromagnetic energy

40:25.460 --> 40:28.960
of the Earth,
in order to create a vortex

40:29.090 --> 40:32.840
and open a gateway
for extraterrestrials?

40:32.970 --> 40:36.930
And if so, could that gateway
have been left open,

40:37.060 --> 40:39.060
making it possible
for the scores

40:39.180 --> 40:42.640
of otherworldly encounters
that have followed?

40:42.770 --> 40:46.860
In my opinion,
the vortexes and the portals

40:46.980 --> 40:49.900
have been around for many,
many thousands of years.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.990
And with each generation,

40:52.110 --> 40:54.530
we interpret the
supernatural events,

40:54.660 --> 40:58.240
the paranormal phenomena,
that repeatedly occur

40:58.370 --> 41:00.500
in these areas
in different ways.

41:00.620 --> 41:05.120
Sometimes we see them
as demons and devils.

41:05.250 --> 41:10.420
Today, we see them as spacemen,
as places of extraterrestrials.

41:10.550 --> 41:13.800
Tomorrow, they may be
the portals through which

41:13.930 --> 41:18.430
trans-dimensional beings are
making contact with this world.

41:18.550 --> 41:23.230
STRIEBER: I don't think
that we should ever assume

41:23.350 --> 41:26.440
that we have
always been alone here.

41:26.560 --> 41:30.070
There's too much evidence
that that is not true.

41:30.190 --> 41:32.650
It's just that we don't like
to look at that evidence.

41:32.780 --> 41:37.200
NARRATOR: Did the Druids
arrive in America centuries ago

41:37.320 --> 41:40.910
and forever leave
their imprint on the land,

41:41.040 --> 41:44.580
creating an entry point
for beings from other worlds,

41:44.710 --> 41:49.250
other dimensions,
and even other points in time?

41:49.380 --> 41:52.800
Perhaps as we learn more
about the ancient Druids,

41:52.920 --> 41:57.340
we will uncover the secret to
harnessing this power ourselves,

41:57.470 --> 42:02.640
and finally be prepared to meet
our ancient alien ancestors.
