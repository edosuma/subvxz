18:54.800 --> 18:56.791
I hope
you're paying him properly.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.149
Well, there's something,
you know,

18:57.240 --> 18:58.195
employer confidentiality
so I can't discuss...

18:58.400 --> 18:59.355
Tenner a day.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.474
Good God!
Here! I'll report you!

19:04.240 --> 19:07.232
No, no, tenner a day!
I pay you more than...

19:06.080 --> 19:07.718
It's always a tenner a day.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.910
I'm not having that, I'm going to be
having strong words

19:10.760 --> 19:11.715
with the accountant tomorrow.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.271
Make sure you do.
I will do it now for you, madam.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.473
Ten pound a day, come on, mate!

19:21.720 --> 19:24.109
- Enjoy the food.
- PETE: Thank you.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.314
Does that mean I get
paid more now, Chabzy?

19:24.760 --> 19:26.193
You know what Steve's
I just got a text through

19:27.600 --> 19:30.068
and they have just confirmed
that you're on the right wage.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.709
- Okay. Thanks for checking, man.
- No problem, mate.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.438
DJ BEATS: (LAUGHS)
I'll get the next ones in then.

19:41.240 --> 19:42.719
You lot probably want to get
to know each other.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.356
- Same again?
- Yes, please, mate.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.953
Actually, Kev. Sorry.
What's the capital of Thailand?

19:47.440 --> 19:48.395
Fuck knows. Singapore?

19:50.480 --> 19:52.789
- Nope, Bangkok! (LAUGHS)
- (GROANS, LAUGHS)

19:53.520 --> 19:56.353
That actually hurt.
Good one, innit?

19:55.080 --> 19:56.433
Nah. I've heard that one before.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.400
I would have said "Bangkok"
and blocked it straight away.

19:59.000 --> 19:59.955
Same again, yeah?

20:00.560 --> 20:01.515
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.755
CAROL: <i>If you're happy</i>
<i>and you know it clap your hands</i>

20:08.240 --> 20:10.549
- Miche, tea's up, babe.
- MICHE: <i>Thanks, Mum.</i>

20:09.720 --> 20:10.755
Thank you.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.879
Where are your bin-bags?

20:13.320 --> 20:15.038
Mum, I told you.
We're not packing his stuff up.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.669
This is your house, babe.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.759
You don't want to have all these
reminders. D'you know what I mean?

20:17.960 --> 20:19.439
It makes the breakup
even harder.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.876
I told you, we're not breaking up.
We're just taking some time out.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.949
I hear ya.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.911
INTERVIEWER: Do you think Miche
and Grindah make a good couple?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.191
Not really, darling.
I just think she could, you know...

20:30.720 --> 20:33.792
He is punching well above his weight.
Well, above his weight.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.432
<i>And I just think she's worth</i>
<i>more than that, you know.</i>

20:34.600 --> 20:36.192
<i>She's my princess,</i>
<i>so I'm gonna say that, aren't I?</i>

20:37.360 --> 20:38.554
But he is a tosser.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.468
Tell you that for nothing.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.749
Tell you what we'll do, yeah?

20:43.320 --> 20:44.833
We just pack up
his stuff anyway, yeah,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.479
pop it by the door,
then if the break-up

20:47.760 --> 20:50.320
were to go ahead, God forbid,
we'd be ready.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.269
No, Mum.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.718
Put the bin-bags down, Mum.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.919
- There's the taxi.
- Yeah.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.198
Let's open the door for you.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.835
- There we go.
- See ya later.

21:00.880 --> 21:01.995
You're gonna be all right
getting back, yeah?

21:04.200 --> 21:07.317
Ooh. I'll be fine.
Peter will look after me.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.678
Yes, you'll be well looked after.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.519
Yeah, let's get you back
before you start getting tired.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.390
I've still got
plenty of energy left.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.673
(CHUCKLING)

21:15.200 --> 21:17.031
You doing something
when you get back?

21:18.520 --> 21:21.637
I certainly hope so. (CHUCKLES)

21:21.680 --> 21:24.638
- You lot have a good one.
- Perhaps more than one.

21:24.920 --> 21:27.957
- Ooh. Stop it!
- (LAUGHING)

21:26.160 --> 21:27.195
See you later anyway.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.476
Bye, darling. See ya. Bye.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.519
- PETE: Bye, Steve.
- STEVES: See ya later! Bye!

21:38.400 --> 21:40.709
What do you think of him?
He's proper safe, innit?

21:40.280 --> 21:41.315
On the level.

21:42.840 --> 21:43.955
Not my level, mate.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.031
- Here you go, boys.
- Cheers, mate.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.149
No worries, man.

21:49.480 --> 21:50.515
There you go, pal.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.159
Boys, you see that barmaid?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.072
She's a proper sort, mate,
you know what I mean?

21:55.560 --> 21:56.515
Yeah.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.675
You know what would
make her look better though?

21:59.320 --> 22:01.709
- Go on.
- My balls on her chin!

22:01.240 --> 22:02.958
(LAUGHING)

22:03.720 --> 22:05.995
- The imagery.
- Just fucking like that.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.358
I was just gonna say,
are those Huaraches?

22:07.240 --> 22:08.639
Huaraches, yes, mate.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.356
Proper comfortable.
Good for raving.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.079
He loves raving as well.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.390
What sort of music
do you actually like then?

22:15.640 --> 22:16.834
I dunno.
Bit of everything really.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.755
Sort of house,
techno stuff really.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.758
House? Hmm.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.039
What's your standpoint
on garage?

22:23.040 --> 22:24.314
(SCOFFS) Garage?

22:24.720 --> 22:26.199
Fuck, man, I ain't listened
to that for years.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.996
Hang on a minute,
it ain't 1998 is it?

22:28.560 --> 22:29.959
(LAUGHING)

22:30.720 --> 22:32.392
No it's not, mate.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.390
I mean only an idiot would listen
to garage now, wouldn't they?

22:35.400 --> 22:37.436
- Fucking pile of shit, mate.
- Yeah, it is, innit?

22:36.720 --> 22:37.835
Why would you
ever listen to garage?

22:38.120 --> 22:39.314
(LAUGHS) Not a fucking clue.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.353
Hang on, I think So Solid Crew
are calling me up.

22:41.000 --> 22:41.955
(LAUGHING)

22:44.080 --> 22:46.958
I tell you what, why don't
we delete garage forever?

22:45.720 --> 22:47.153
- (DARREN CHUCKLES)
- Yeah.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.953
You've got twenty-one
seconds to go?

22:49.280 --> 22:50.918
GRINDAH: Fuck off then, if you've got
twenty-one seconds to go,

22:51.000 --> 22:52.513
just fuck off, garage.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.913
Bunch of twats.
Yeah, fuck off! Get out of my life.

22:53.720 --> 22:54.675
(SIGHING)

22:55.360 --> 22:56.793
Go and make some
good fucking music.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.593
Funny fucker you are.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.709
(DARREN GIGGLES)

23:01.880 --> 23:03.871
I've just realized
I've gotta shoot off, but...

23:05.120 --> 23:08.157
Enjoy your night, lads, yeah?
(SIGHS)

23:06.320 --> 23:07.309
See you later, boy.
Nice to meet you.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.232
Yeah, nice to meet you, mate.
Take care.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.511
Yeah I'm probably gonna
shoot off as well, actually.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.876
I've got, like, an urgent thing...

23:19.160 --> 23:20.275
What you're going?

23:20.960 --> 23:22.552
Keep the pints though, man.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.600
Well, I'll see you Thursday then.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.675
I'll let you know.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.748
All right?

23:31.720 --> 23:34.029
Come on, mate.
Let's get you home.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.591
You can do so much
better than that.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.515
DJ BEATS: I know.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.912
CHABUDDY: <i>Okay, who is up</i>
<i>for a bit of Champagne?</i>

23:39.400 --> 23:40.355
Tia?

23:41.680 --> 23:43.750
You know what,
it's been a good day.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.593
Steves, you want one?

23:48.120 --> 23:50.554
Nah, I don't touch that stuff.
Fucks with your head.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.588
Oh, God. The good stuff.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.959
This always makes me jump.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.308
- (CORK POPS)
- Don't shake it!

23:59.080 --> 24:01.878
(LAUGHS) To my new
business apprentice.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.877
You're more like
my apprentice if anything.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.196
To think, yeah,
this place was nothing

24:05.360 --> 24:07.271
and we've built up
a whole restaurant together.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.872
I'm basically Gordon Ramsey.
Gordon Chabzy. (CHUCKLES)

24:12.640 --> 24:14.949
I think we work really well
together as a team.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.437
I think we work really well
together too.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.430
It's just beautiful.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.113
Let's not do that.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.791
Sorry. I thought...
that was my moment...

24:23.200 --> 24:24.315
It's okay.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.678
I think you just got
things a bit twisted.

24:29.160 --> 24:32.152
Look, you're my boss.
I admire you as a professional.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.233
I think we work really well,
as a team.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.989
And you've done it again.

24:35.840 --> 24:38.070
Sorry, I just...
read it wrong again.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.674
STEVES: Easy!

24:43.280 --> 24:45.919
- Bare washing up to do, man.
- Yeah.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.109
(SIGHS) Safe, man,
see you tomorrow, yeah?

24:47.080 --> 24:48.149
See you tomorrow.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.993
Or... I was gonna say, actually.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.118
I might as well,
just stay round tonight.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.791
Nah, I'll be fine, man, honestly.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.394
Thanks for caring though.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.073
Yeah, just you know,
good to make sure you're all right

24:59.440 --> 25:00.953
after what you've been
through and that.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.949
Nah, I'll be fine.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.757
Roche and Craig are there,
they'll perk me up.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.915
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

25:09.760 --> 25:13.673
Look, I just... I don't want
to go back home, man,

25:14.400 --> 25:16.960
Miche has been doing my nut in
and just...

25:16.440 --> 25:18.112
Bare arguments and that.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.758
- She kick you out?
- She didn't kick me out,

25:22.320 --> 25:26.233
she just...
Look, it's complicated, all right,

25:23.960 --> 25:25.393
and I just can't
go back there tonight.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.630
Mate, of course you can stay.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.878
SNM, mate, say no more.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.155
- What did I tell ya?
- My <i>casa</i> is your <i>casa.</i>

25:32.760 --> 25:34.512
- Come on, let's go in.
- Let's go in.

25:34.920 --> 25:35.875
(SIGHING)

25:36.960 --> 25:38.791
Actually,
I just got to ask Roche

25:40.120 --> 25:41.678
- if it's all right first.
- Oh, great!

25:43.360 --> 25:44.475
(DOOR CLOSES)

25:45.080 --> 25:46.593
- Rochelle?
- Yeah?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.472
- Hi, Roche.
- Hi.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.316
- How are you?
- Fine.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.795
- How's Craig?
- Fine.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.115
Cool.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.713
- Roche?
- Yes?

25:59.800 --> 26:03.190
Is it all right
if Grindah stays tonight?

26:01.520 --> 26:03.033
He had, like, this big fight
with Miche

26:04.240 --> 26:06.754
- and she kicked him out.
- She didn't kick me out, I left

26:05.400 --> 26:06.355
'cause she was acting
all weird.

26:06.760 --> 26:07.909
Did you put her
in a bad mood?

26:09.440 --> 26:11.158
I think you're more than
capable of that yourself.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.670
- Beats said I can stay. So...
- It ain't up to Beats, is it? So...

26:15.920 --> 26:17.069
- Beats?
- Sorry.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.995
Is it all right?

26:22.280 --> 26:24.396
All right you can stay,
but just for tonight.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.395
- Sweet.
- I'm gonna get a juice.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.954
Yeah, help yourself, mate.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.711
So did you have
a nice drink with Darren?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.758
Nah, shit. To be honest
I don't really wanna go

26:32.320 --> 26:33.548
parent classes anymore.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.596
Well, you know I'm up for that.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.675
DJ BEATS: Yeah.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.798
You don't need it these days, do ya?
It's pointless.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.993
- DJ BEATS: Yeah.
- (GROANS)

26:41.120 --> 26:42.394
Did something happen with Darren?

26:43.160 --> 26:44.991
You two seemed like you were
getting on really well.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.039
- Nah.
- DJ BEATS: Nah.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.159
He's just not who I thought he was.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.871
I don't really wanna talk about it
to be honest.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.511
Okay. I won't ask anymore then.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.753
CAROL: <i>Do you want some</i>
<i>wine now, Miche?</i>

26:57.880 --> 26:59.313
- MICHE: I'm all right thanks.
- Are you sure?

27:01.640 --> 27:05.189
- It does help.
- Yeah, I'll see if the tea works.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.313
If in doubt, drink wine.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.156
Mummy? Where's daddy?

27:13.720 --> 27:16.871
Oh, Daddy's having a sleep
over at Uncle Beats' house.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.276
- Why?
- CAROL: Why?

27:20.000 --> 27:23.356
Because sometimes grown ups
need to be separate,

27:24.640 --> 27:28.679
because one of them is an idiot
and takes everything for granted.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.235
Mummy, Nana says you're an idiot.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.752
No, she's not talking about me,
she's talking about Daddy.

27:30.360 --> 27:31.509
Daddy's an idiot.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.274
CAROL: Daddy's a plonker.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.874
Brought you the sleeping bag.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.196
(GROANS) This is beautiful.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.429
- Yeah, I'll just...
- Yeah.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.551
It's lovely being able to
sprawl out, actually.
