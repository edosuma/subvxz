WEBVTT

00:01.959 --> 00:03.250
Previously.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.165
Looks like I'm not as toothless
as you thought, sweetheart.

00:07.166 --> 00:09.666
- How?
- You came back wrong.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.833
Willow, you're using
too much magic.

00:11.834 --> 00:14.290
What do you want me to do, just
sit back and keep my mouth shut?

00:14.291 --> 00:15.707
That'd be a good start.

00:15.708 --> 00:18.791
- Forget.
- I know you used that spell on me.

00:18.792 --> 00:20.165
What is wrong with you?

00:20.166 --> 00:22.082
I don't think
this is gonna work.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.583
Are you saying
you're gonna leave me?

00:27.333 --> 00:30.666
- Amy, how have you been?
- Rat. You?

00:30.667 --> 00:32.415
- Dead.
- Oh.

00:32.417 --> 00:36.500
It's nice, having another
magically inclined friend around.

00:38.166 --> 00:41.707
There's gotta be someplace,
like, bigger than this.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.834
It's way too early
to go home yet.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.624
- It's beautiful.
- Boys, congratulations.

00:47.625 --> 00:49.624
Phase one of the plan
is now complete.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.125
- I'm in love with you.
- You're in love with pain.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.834
Are you afraid I'm gonna...

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.875 --> 01:09.457
Uh-oh. Morning paper!

01:09.458 --> 01:13.207
Hello.
Good morning.

01:13.208 --> 01:15.083
Morning-paper dog here.

01:26.417 --> 01:29.083
What time is it?

01:33.166 --> 01:36.417
Almost 7:00. God, I just
closed my eyes for a minute.

01:37.667 --> 01:41.207
A-and now
there's cartoons.

01:41.208 --> 01:45.249
Plus I have the mother
of all-night wedgies.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.499
Uh-oh.
Mmm. It's not tragic.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.457
I'm sure as soon
as I stand up...

01:50.458 --> 01:53.040
No, dawn.

01:53.041 --> 01:55.749
Why didn't anybody
wake us up?

01:55.750 --> 01:57.708
Where is everyone?

02:08.750 --> 02:11.165
Willow didn't
come home either.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.625
They were out
all night.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.165
Where are they?

02:17.166 --> 02:20.165
I'm sure they're fine, dawnie.
I'm sure they just...

02:20.166 --> 02:21.959
Lost track of time.

02:41.792 --> 02:43.750
When...

02:45.417 --> 02:47.959
When did the building
fall down?

02:50.667 --> 02:53.124
I don't know.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.207
Must have been some time between
the first time and the, uh...

02:56.208 --> 02:58.500
Oh.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.792
Oh, my god.

04:01.125 --> 04:04.416
Shoe. I need my shoe.

04:04.417 --> 04:07.582
- What's the hurry, love?
- The hurry is I left dawn all night.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.624
And don't
call me "love."

04:09.625 --> 04:13.582
You didn't seem to take issue
with that last night.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.749
Or with any of the other
little nasties we whispered.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.000
Can we not talk?

04:19.875 --> 04:22.124
I just don't see why
you have to run off so quick.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.416
- I thought we could...
- Not gonna happen!

04:24.417 --> 04:26.708
Last night was the end
of this freak show.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.916
Don't say that!

04:31.917 --> 04:33.916
What did you think
was gonna happen?

04:33.917 --> 04:36.332
What? We're gonna read
the newspaper together?

04:36.333 --> 04:39.124
Play footsie
under the rubble?

04:39.125 --> 04:42.791
Not exactly what I had in mind.
Stop!

04:42.792 --> 04:45.500
Make me.
No! Ow!

04:50.125 --> 04:52.916
No! No!
I-i have to...

04:52.917 --> 04:56.583
Stay. I'm stuck here.
Sun's out.

05:05.208 --> 05:08.374
I knew. I knew the only thing better
than killing a slayer would be f...

05:08.375 --> 05:10.916
What?

05:10.917 --> 05:14.707
That's what this was about?
Doing a slayer?

05:14.708 --> 05:16.999
I wouldn't throw stones, pet.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.874
- You seem to be quite the groupie yourself.
- Shut up.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.124
I'm just saying
vampires get you hot.

05:23.125 --> 05:26.416
A vampire got
me hot. One!

05:26.417 --> 05:29.083
But he's gone.
You're just...

05:31.875 --> 05:33.625
You're just convenient.

05:40.875 --> 05:43.290
So, what now?

05:43.291 --> 05:45.416
You go back to
treating me like dirt...

05:45.417 --> 05:48.374
Until the next time you got
an itch you can't scratch?

05:48.375 --> 05:50.291
Well, forget it!

05:51.959 --> 05:55.749
Last night changed things. I'm
done being your whipping boy.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.582
- Nothing's changed. It was a mistake.
- Bollocks!

05:58.583 --> 06:00.417
It was
a bloody revelation.

06:02.667 --> 06:06.791
You can act as high
and mighty as you like,

06:06.792 --> 06:10.332
but I know where
you live now, slayer.

06:10.333 --> 06:13.916
I've tasted it.
Get a grip.

06:13.917 --> 06:16.374
Like you're god's gift.
Hardly.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.125
It wouldn't be nearly
as interesting, would it?

06:20.708 --> 06:22.834
No! Let me go!

06:24.458 --> 06:26.582
I may be dirt,

06:26.583 --> 06:30.165
but you're the one who likes
to roll in it, slayer.

06:30.166 --> 06:33.332
You never had it so good as me.
Never. Oh, you're bent!

06:33.333 --> 06:36.666
Yeah. But it made you scream,
didn't it?

06:36.667 --> 06:39.749
I swear to god,
if you tell...

06:39.750 --> 06:42.207
Anyone about last night,

06:42.208 --> 06:45.374
I will kill you.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.291
Right.

06:48.917 --> 06:51.041
You, uh, gonna
want these too.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.541
Pancakes?

06:59.542 --> 07:02.082
Uh, sure.

07:02.083 --> 07:04.624
Um, should we call Xander?

07:04.625 --> 07:07.290
What if they're all
in a ditch somewhere?

07:07.291 --> 07:11.166
Ditches are bad. Mom always
used to talk about the ditches.

07:11.167 --> 07:12.999
Nobody's in a ditch.
We'll call,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.833
but we'll give 'em some time
before we wake them up.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.916
Funny shapes or...

07:18.917 --> 07:21.499
Won't be able
to eat for a while.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.380
No worries though. It'll
wear off in a day or...

07:24.750 --> 07:28.749
- Hey.
- Hey. I just...

07:28.750 --> 07:32.291
B-Buffy didn't come home
last night either, so...

07:34.291 --> 07:37.082
Uh, hey.
Uh, this is Amy.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.624
Amy, Tara. Tara, Amy.
How you doing?

07:39.625 --> 07:43.374
Fine. I... I'd
b-b-better g-get going.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.624
Amy. Amy the rat?
Sorry.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.917
No. That's fair.
I was a rat.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.666
When...

07:52.667 --> 07:55.249
Last night. It's nuts.
Everything's different.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.874
I mean, the bronze, for one thing.
And Willow.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.749
She's a freakin'
amazing witch now.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.707
- I couldn't even keep up with her last night.
- Amy.

08:02.708 --> 08:05.166
No, its true! I mean
I can do some transmogrify,

08:05.167 --> 08:06.999
but she is messing with
dimensions and everything.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.666
It was awesome! This blowhard dude?
First, she made his mouth disappear.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.791
Thank god. And then...

08:12.792 --> 08:15.374
I'm talking too much.
Sorry.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.541
It's just been,
you know,

08:17.542 --> 08:20.332
me and a bag of pellets
for the last few years, so...

08:20.333 --> 08:24.040
No, I-i-it's fine.
It's just, um...

08:24.041 --> 08:26.624
I-I really need to go.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.791
Tara, wait. You left some
stuff upstairs. I saved...

08:28.792 --> 08:32.332
- I'll get them later.
- Tara.

08:36.707 --> 08:40.749
Buffy! Where were you?
Are you okay?

08:40.750 --> 08:43.499
I'm fine.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.082
You're not.
You're all sore and limpy.

08:46.083 --> 08:50.749
I-I'm not sore.
I just, uh, had a fight.

08:50.750 --> 08:53.624
You know,
the all-nighter kind.

08:53.625 --> 08:56.457
Figured. I knew
that's why you didn't call.

08:56.458 --> 08:59.417
So, what's the big bad?
Should we be worried?

09:00.750 --> 09:04.000
No. I-i think
you guys are safe.

09:05.708 --> 09:09.207
- Tara was here?
- I guess she stayed over with dawn.

09:09.208 --> 09:11.083
You guess?
Where were you?

09:12.583 --> 09:15.707
We went out. We kind
of lost track of time.

09:15.708 --> 09:18.457
Oh.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.791
I never would have if I knew
you weren't coming home.

09:20.792 --> 09:23.332
No, of course.
I mean, you know,

09:23.333 --> 09:25.666
it wasn't intentional.

09:25.667 --> 09:27.833
And, you know,
everyone's safe.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.791
You are, right?
You're okay?

09:29.792 --> 09:32.290
Oh, yeah. I mean, um...

09:32.291 --> 09:35.708
I think my pancakes
are burning, but...

09:40.834 --> 09:42.834
Tara was making them.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.624
I've, uh...
I've got to get some sleep.

09:47.625 --> 09:50.416
Me too.

09:50.417 --> 09:53.290
Yeah. I should go home.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.999
Dad's expecting me. Okay.
I'll call you later.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.041
Yeah. Good.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.124
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm sorry about everything.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.040
It's okay.
You should rest.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.333
You're beat from
monster wrestling all night.

10:10.917 --> 10:13.250
Yeah. Right. Thanks.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.833
Yeah. I'm gonna
crash too.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.916
Night, dawnie.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.874
No problem. I'll just...

10:23.875 --> 10:25.708
Go find some awake people.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.290
All these demons are
starting to look alike.

11:14.291 --> 11:17.249
You got reptiles,
reptiles with horns,

11:17.250 --> 11:20.416
reptiles with gills.

11:20.417 --> 11:23.917
I'm still finding nothing of the "steal
a diamond, freeze a guy" variety.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.834
An, would you hand me
that one next to you?

11:30.208 --> 11:33.792
Great. We're not even married yet, and
already you've stopped listening to me.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.374
Anya! I'm sorry, but
this is pointless.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.541
We've been researching forever,
and we're not close...

11:43.542 --> 11:45.416
To finding out
who robbed that museum.

11:45.417 --> 11:48.040
- What's up?
- Anya has a theory.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.124
She thinks that Martha
Stewart froze that guy.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.874
Don't be ridiculous. Martha
Stewart isn't a demon.

11:52.875 --> 11:56.165
She's a witch. Please,
she... really?

11:56.166 --> 11:58.624
Of course. Nobody could
do that much decoupage...

11:58.625 --> 12:01.207
Without calling
on the powers of darkness.

12:01.208 --> 12:03.582
Guys, while this is fascinating,
we still have work to do.

12:03.583 --> 12:08.082
I know I do. I can't decide whether to put
my bridesmaids in cocktail dresses...

12:08.083 --> 12:10.999
Or the traditional burlap
with blood larva.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.082
The traditional what? Well, I was a
demon for a thousand years, Xander.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.165
You can't expect me to turn my
back on all the ways of my people.

12:17.166 --> 12:20.332
- Can I weigh in on this whole "me wearing larva"?
- - No.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.874
At least I'm not asking you to perform
the groom's rite of self-flagellation.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.333
Uh, guys. There's
something out there.

12:27.708 --> 12:30.040
There is. And as much
as I hate to admit...

12:30.041 --> 12:34.124
That my bizarre
bride-to-be has a point,

12:34.125 --> 12:36.124
we're gettin'
nowhere here, buff.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.541
Maybe it's time to try something new.
You know?

12:38.542 --> 12:42.207
Hit the streets. Get spike on it.
No. No. No spike.

12:42.208 --> 12:45.749
A-and no "hit the streets."
W-we stay put, you know?

12:45.750 --> 12:48.125
Away from distractions.
We'll figure this out.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.457
What about Willow?
Can't she do something?

12:52.458 --> 12:54.541
Maybe.
But she's home sleeping.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.791
Sleeping?
She sick?

12:56.792 --> 12:59.249
No. She was
out late with Amy.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.457
And I'm bizarre?

13:01.458 --> 13:04.707
At least I didn't dump you
to hang out with an ex-rat.

13:04.708 --> 13:08.249
No, it's not like that. She's just
helping Amy through a transition.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.165
And making herself a
playmate to do magic with.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.165
Someone who won't
monitor her, like Tara.

13:13.166 --> 13:16.417
Willow's a grown-up. Maybe she
doesn't need to be monitored.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.916
She's going through something,
but we're not her.

13:20.917 --> 13:23.916
I mean, maybe she has reasons
for acting this way.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.958
And so what
if she crossed a line?

13:26.959 --> 13:30.040
You know, we all do stuff.
Stupid stuff.

13:30.041 --> 13:33.541
But then we learn. A-and we
learn, and we don't do it again.

13:33.542 --> 13:36.499
Okay, so, you know, who
are we to be all judgey?

13:36.500 --> 13:40.916
Not judgey, buff.
Just observey.

13:40.917 --> 13:43.541
Yeah, all we're saying is she's
acting different, you know?

13:43.542 --> 13:45.417
She's not herself.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.916
So, what do you
want to do?

13:49.917 --> 13:52.124
It's gonna be hard
to top last night.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.124
Yeah. I don't know
if I can.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.707
I felt awful today.
And I couldn't do magic.

13:56.708 --> 13:59.124
It took me all day
to get my powers back.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.082
I think we should
just take it easy.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.833
I have a better idea.
What?

14:03.834 --> 14:07.749
I know this guy. And he knows
spells that last for days.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.708
The burn-out factor
is, like, nothing.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.833
Really?
He's a warlock?

14:12.834 --> 14:15.208
I guess.
But I'm not kidding you.

14:15.209 --> 14:18.624
This guy
will blow your mind.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.750
He will take you to places
that you can't even imagine.

14:25.083 --> 14:28.207
Is it dangerous?

14:28.208 --> 14:30.333
Would that stop you?

14:43.959 --> 14:46.249
This is it.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.958
Where? I thought you said
the guy lived around here.

14:48.959 --> 14:52.040
He does.
You can't feel it?

14:52.041 --> 14:53.959
What do you...

14:55.708 --> 14:57.791
Here.

14:57.792 --> 15:00.000
It's hot.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.125
Come on.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.249
It's cool, isn't it?
The place is cloaked.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.833
Yeah. Moves around a lot too.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.749
Keeps rack
out of trouble.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.000
Rack? Who's...

15:35.000 --> 15:37.332
Rack. Rack, it's my turn.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.249
No, man. You said I was up. Bull!
I've been here for hours!

15:40.250 --> 15:43.875
I believe
these two were next.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.333
Thanks, rack,
for taking us.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.833
I know
it's been a while.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.875
- You'll never believe...
- You were a rat.

16:06.792 --> 16:09.416
- How did you know?
- I hope that taught you...

16:09.417 --> 16:12.207
Not to mess with spells
you can't handle.

16:12.208 --> 16:15.083
You should leave that in the
hands of a professional.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.833
Ooh.

16:18.834 --> 16:21.999
This one's
giving off vibes.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.290
I don't mean
to vibe at you,

16:25.291 --> 16:27.416
uh, if it's
in a negative way.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.457
No. No. I mean you...
You have power, girl.

16:30.458 --> 16:33.208
It's just
coming off you in waves.

16:33.209 --> 16:35.374
Not so much.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.040
I mean,
I can do stuff,

16:38.041 --> 16:40.124
but I-i get
tapped out quick.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.290
And I've used practically
every spell I know.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.291
And what do you want me
to do about that?

16:47.834 --> 16:51.999
I don't know. I-i
thought... Amy said...

16:52.000 --> 16:55.541
"Amy said."

16:55.542 --> 16:57.707
Amy said
I could help you.

16:57.708 --> 16:59.834
But did Amy say
how you could help me?

17:02.166 --> 17:03.999
No. I have
some money, a bit...

17:04.000 --> 17:06.833
Not money.

17:06.834 --> 17:09.750
I could help you with your computer.
I'm really handy.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.707
Just relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

17:13.708 --> 17:16.165
You got to give a little
to get a little, right?

17:19.209 --> 17:23.208
It's okay.
It's over fast.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.124
That's right.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.125
I'm just gonna
take a little tour.

17:51.166 --> 17:54.166
You taste
like strawberries.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.667

the hard way.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.999
Spatulas are for wimps.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.624
I'm making peanut butter and
banana quesadillas. You want?

21:28.625 --> 21:30.707
No, thanks.

21:30.708 --> 21:33.124
I'm, uh, more
in water mode.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.499
Ow. Ow. Ow.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.833
Huh. You sure? It's my
own brand-new invention.

21:38.834 --> 21:43.667
Mmm. I'm sure. My tummy's
feeling kind of rumbly.

21:45.583 --> 21:47.333
Your loss.
Very delicious.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.666
Buffy called. She said
she was going straight...

21:51.667 --> 21:53.624
From the magic box
to do some patrolling.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.791
Oh. Did she need help?

21:55.792 --> 21:57.666
No, she was
just calling to check in,

21:57.667 --> 21:59.833
for, like,
the 10th time today.

21:59.834 --> 22:02.833
I think she's feeling all Joan
Crawford 'cause of the other night.

22:02.834 --> 22:05.374
Yeah, about that, um,
I'm really sorry.

22:05.375 --> 22:08.457
I-I shouldn't have assumed
Buffy would be here.

22:08.458 --> 22:11.582
Right. Assume would make
"u" an "ass" out of "me."

22:11.583 --> 22:13.582
Or, um, something.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.874
Anyway, please.
It's cool.

22:15.875 --> 22:18.290
I mean, it's not like I even
needed Tara to stay over.

22:18.291 --> 22:21.833
I'm so totally fine
on my own.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.457
But you are gonna
be around tonight, right?

22:24.458 --> 22:26.874
Right. Totally.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.707
Oh, w-we can do something
if you want.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.916
A movie maybe?
Really?

22:32.917 --> 22:35.082
But I thought
you weren't feeling so good.

22:35.083 --> 22:38.958
Well, nothin' a little
dawnie time won't fix.

22:38.959 --> 22:42.457
If you feel like baggin' the peanut
butter, I'll even buy you dinner.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.874
Oh.
Thank god.

22:44.875 --> 22:48.499
Remind me never
to invent that again. Yuck.

22:48.500 --> 22:51.582
Mmm. Great.
This will be great.

22:51.583 --> 22:54.124
I'll just grab the paper
and see what's playing.

22:54.125 --> 22:57.457
I'll leave a note for Buffy
on the refrigerator.

22:57.458 --> 23:01.018
That's the first place she goes after patrolling.
She's such a pig after she kills things.

23:09.583 --> 23:11.667
Hello?

23:16.542 --> 23:18.750
Willow?

23:20.542 --> 23:22.500
Dawn?

23:42.291 --> 23:45.374
What's going on?
Uh-oh.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.916
Busted.
Where's Willow?

23:47.917 --> 23:51.499
She said...
She said I could... wait.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.082
What is this? It's not
what you think it is.

23:54.083 --> 23:57.207
It's Sage. That is
what I think it is.

23:57.208 --> 24:00.332
What's going on? Where's
Willow and dawn?

24:00.333 --> 24:03.749
Well, I-i...

24:03.750 --> 24:06.791
I saw... I saw her,
but that was...

24:06.792 --> 24:10.541
I like your coat. When does
a slayer find time to shop?

24:10.542 --> 24:13.416
So they didn't
let you in?

24:13.417 --> 24:15.749
Not that they know of.

24:15.750 --> 24:19.207
What else did you take?
Nothing.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.416
Ow!
What else?

24:21.417 --> 24:23.791
Please.
Please, I need this stuff.

24:23.792 --> 24:26.582
Willow wants me to have it.
She understands.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.916
Understands what? Breaking into
someone's house for kitchen spices?

24:29.917 --> 24:32.165
No.
I don't think so.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.374
You should.

24:34.375 --> 24:36.457
She's as bad as I am.
Worse.

24:36.458 --> 24:39.666
I bet she's
at rack's right now.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.958
Rack's?
A place.

24:41.959 --> 24:45.040
H-he does spells,
heavy stuff.

24:45.041 --> 24:47.416
Willow's his new favorite.
She's there?

24:47.417 --> 24:49.416
With dawn?

24:49.417 --> 24:52.582
Oh, don't shake me again, super strength.
I think I'm gonna boot.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.749
Then tell me where this
place is, and I won't.

24:54.750 --> 24:57.207
It's downtown.
But it moves.

24:57.208 --> 24:59.666
What do you mean,
it moves?

24:59.667 --> 25:03.207
It's downtown. I'm not sure where
it would be tonight exactly.

25:03.208 --> 25:05.608
Tell me how to find it. You just
kind of have to feel it out!

25:06.667 --> 25:09.209
Oh, god, I think I'm gonna...
Oh, god.

25:10.875 --> 25:14.208
So, uh, the burger was good?
You liked it?

25:14.209 --> 25:17.208
Are you kidding? It was like
a meat party in my mouth.

25:17.209 --> 25:21.208
Okay. Now, I'm just a kid, and
even I know that came out wrong.

25:21.209 --> 25:23.290
Huh.
It was good.

25:23.291 --> 25:26.082
But you should've
had something.

25:26.083 --> 25:29.458
I will. I'll eat. I'm
saving myself for popcorn.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.707
The other day,
you had fun?

25:34.708 --> 25:37.040
Mmm. What other day?

25:37.041 --> 25:39.499
Give me a "Mon" or a "Fri"
here... something to work with.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.916
The other day with Tara.
Oh.

25:42.917 --> 25:47.249
Uh, yeah. I mean, it
was... it was nice.

25:47.250 --> 25:50.332
But it wasn't a laugh riot.
She's sad and everything.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.541
Did she say something?

25:52.542 --> 25:54.624
Not exactly.

25:54.625 --> 25:57.666
I-I can just tell by the
way she was acting.

25:57.667 --> 26:00.375
Oh.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.582
Uh, are you sure
you're okay?

26:04.583 --> 26:07.332
- You look a little...
- No, I'm fine.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.791
And Tara's in her new place and everything?
She's all settled in?

26:10.792 --> 26:14.165
Um, we really
didn't get into...

26:14.166 --> 26:17.207
Well, is this right?

26:17.208 --> 26:19.332
Is this the way
to the movies?

26:19.333 --> 26:23.124
Oh, yeah. I'm, uh, just... i
took you the long way around.

26:23.125 --> 26:27.333
But we're almost there. I, uh, just
have to make one quick stop first.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.290
What is this place?

26:34.291 --> 26:37.749
Why is it hidden? I don't know.
It's cool, isn't it?

26:37.750 --> 26:40.791
Okay, you just hang here for a minute.
I'll be back.

26:40.792 --> 26:43.749
Y-you want me to conjure you
a magazine or something?

26:43.750 --> 26:46.666
What about the movie?
It starts at 9:00.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.958
We'll make it.
I-I'll just be a minute.

26:48.959 --> 26:51.417
It doesn't matter
if we miss the trailers.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.125
I like the trailers.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.208
What do you think,
strawberry?

27:34.209 --> 27:35.834
Can you handle some more?

28:22.417 --> 28:24.666
God, do you sleep
through anything?

28:24.667 --> 28:27.332
I was, like,
yelling and nothing.

28:27.333 --> 28:31.416
I'm a bit knackered.
Had a long night.

28:31.417 --> 28:34.707
Someone should teach you how to
use candles in foreplay, love.

28:34.708 --> 28:37.165
Get dressed.
Dawn's missing.

28:37.166 --> 28:39.541
Again?

28:39.542 --> 28:42.749
Ever think about
a lojack for the girl?

28:42.750 --> 28:46.707
- What's the story?
- She went out with Willow.

28:46.708 --> 28:49.666
Willow? That's kind of
a sorry excuse to come by.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.582
You want "the touch,"
all you need to do is...

28:51.583 --> 28:53.874
Spike,
Willow's into something.

28:53.875 --> 28:56.833
Her and dawn have been missing for hours.
There's some guy named rack.

28:56.834 --> 28:59.749
- Rack?
- Yeah, he's some sort of...

28:59.750 --> 29:02.290
I know who he is. He deals in magic.
Black stuff. Dangerous.

29:02.291 --> 29:05.208
I've been all over downtown,
and I can't find his place.

29:05.209 --> 29:07.624
He cloaks it. You can't feel it
unless you're into the big bad.

29:07.625 --> 29:10.458
- A witch or a vampire.
- So let's go.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.582
Oh, that's right.

29:14.583 --> 29:17.167
Hide your blushing eyes.

29:30.542 --> 29:33.250
Hey, wait your turn.

29:34.458 --> 29:38.165
Hey, dawnie.
It's movie time.

29:38.166 --> 29:41.124
Do you know how long I've been out here?
It's too late for the movie.

29:41.125 --> 29:43.000
And that guy
smells like...

29:44.333 --> 29:46.499
A-are you okay?

29:46.500 --> 29:48.333
I'm fine.
Let's get out of here.

29:52.417 --> 29:55.332
So, what do you
want to do, cutie?

29:55.333 --> 29:58.208
It's late.
I just want to go home.

29:58.209 --> 29:59.874
No way. I said
we were gonna have fun,

29:59.875 --> 30:01.667
and we are gonna
have fun.

30:04.417 --> 30:07.624
I'm serious. I think we
should just get out of here.

30:07.625 --> 30:09.582
"I think we should
just get out of here."

30:09.583 --> 30:13.040
Come on, dawnie.
It's grown-up time.

30:13.041 --> 30:16.082
Do you want to play with
the grown-ups or not?

30:16.083 --> 30:18.207
Why are you
acting this way?

30:18.208 --> 30:20.749
Oh, don't get all weird on me.
We're fine.

30:20.750 --> 30:23.792
Everything's fine.

30:27.834 --> 30:30.165
Anything?
Not yet.

30:30.166 --> 30:33.290
I might pick up on it if you'd
stop asking me every two seconds.

30:33.291 --> 30:35.041
Spike, if you're
dragging this out...

30:38.333 --> 30:41.833
What? So I can linger near your
precious self? Get a grip.

30:41.834 --> 30:44.624
Like you've never
drawn things out before.

30:44.625 --> 30:47.457
Maybe. But we've been
through this, haven't we?

30:47.458 --> 30:49.499
Things have changed.
Will you quit that?

30:49.500 --> 30:52.874
The only thing that's different is
that I'm disgusted with myself.

30:52.875 --> 30:55.624
That's the power
of your charms.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.958
Last night...

30:57.959 --> 31:02.582
Was the most perverse, degrading
experience of my life.

31:02.583 --> 31:05.999
Yeah. Me too.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.791
That might be how you get
off, but it's not my style.

31:08.792 --> 31:10.999
No, it's your calling.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.542
Gave me a run
for my money, slayer.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.792
Now, I admit it. You've had
me by the short hairs.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.083
I love you.
You know it.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.457
But I got
my rocks back.

31:25.458 --> 31:27.416
You felt something
last night.

31:27.417 --> 31:29.250
Not love.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.249
Not yet. But I'm in
your system now.

31:33.250 --> 31:35.416
You're gonna crave me
like I crave blood.

31:35.417 --> 31:38.249
And the next time you come calling,
if you don't stop being such a bitch,

31:38.250 --> 31:40.332
maybe I will bite you.

31:40.333 --> 31:43.249
That's it.
I want you out of my life.

31:43.250 --> 31:45.999
Out of my work. Out of my home.
Too late for that.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.499
You invited me in already.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.332
And as for your work, you need me.
Like tonight.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.624
I'll find dawn myself.

31:54.625 --> 31:57.667
You really gonna put your little
sis in danger just to spite me?

31:58.959 --> 32:02.999
Willow, I'm serious.
I'm going home.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.249
Then go.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.707
God, I thought
we were gonna hang.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.916
You're not
coming with me?

32:09.917 --> 32:12.040
Well, I don't know.

32:12.041 --> 32:14.499
Maybe I could
just, uh, pop you back?

32:14.500 --> 32:17.874
With magic?

32:17.875 --> 32:21.624
What's that?

32:21.625 --> 32:24.207
What? I didn't...

32:24.208 --> 32:26.416
Oh... I'm getting out of here.

32:26.417 --> 32:29.707
Oh, dawnie, don't. It was probably
a cat or something like that.

32:29.708 --> 32:31.500
Aaah!

32:33.542 --> 32:36.165
Oh, no. It's okay.
He's not real.

32:36.166 --> 32:39.040
Seems real.
Very real.

32:39.041 --> 32:42.165
- You summon me, witch?
- I-i didn't...

32:42.166 --> 32:45.708
You did. You raised hell
with your magics.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.666
Ow!
Fresh.

32:50.667 --> 32:53.375
- Don't! She has nothing to do with it. It was me!
- Yes.

33:01.166 --> 33:04.666
He's coming!
He's too fast!

33:04.667 --> 33:06.875
Open! Get in!

33:09.125 --> 33:11.749
Close.

33:11.750 --> 33:15.209
Drive!

33:21.041 --> 33:23.166
What are you doing?

33:28.708 --> 33:30.500
Whoo!

33:37.333 --> 33:39.083
Take that, scuzz!

33:51.375 --> 33:53.667
Oh, god.

34:33.625 --> 34:35.581
No! Stop!

34:35.583 --> 34:37.583
Ow!

34:39.750 --> 34:41.500
Aaah!

34:59.458 --> 35:01.625
Dawn!

35:39.500 --> 35:42.333
Now you're scared?
Better late than never.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.999
Dawn.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.208
Dawn. What happened?

36:10.209 --> 36:13.874
Are you okay? Ow! He was after Willow.
She made the car drive.

36:13.875 --> 36:16.332
Don't! No, honey, please.
I need to see it, okay?

36:16.333 --> 36:18.499
Let me see your arm.
Dawn.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.833
- Oh, god. There's blood.
- We need to get her to a doctor.

36:21.834 --> 36:24.249
Is she okay?
Is she okay?

36:24.250 --> 36:26.290
Back off, wil.
I got her.

36:26.291 --> 36:29.082
No. Dawnie!

36:29.083 --> 36:31.165
I mean it.
Stay away from her.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.541
Dawnie! Dawnie,
I am so sorry.

36:33.542 --> 36:36.207
I'm so sorry. It was an accident.
I didn't see.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.208
I'm so, so sorry.

36:42.708 --> 36:45.582
Dawnie.
Dawnie.

36:45.583 --> 36:48.082
Don't!
Dawnie, I'm sorry.

36:48.083 --> 36:51.499
I'm s... I'm sorry.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.916
I'm sorry.

36:53.917 --> 36:57.207
I'm sorry.

36:57.208 --> 36:59.333
I'm sorry.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.124
Get up.

37:19.125 --> 37:22.582
I screwed it up.
Everything. Tara...

37:22.583 --> 37:24.749
Yeah, you know what?
You did screw up. Okay?

37:24.750 --> 37:26.833
You could have killed her!
You almost did!

37:26.834 --> 37:30.582
I know. I know.

37:30.583 --> 37:35.249
I can't stop, Buffy.
I've tried, and I can't.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.874
You can. I can't! I can't.

37:38.875 --> 37:41.999
I ju...
God! I need help.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.749
Please.
Please, help me.

37:44.750 --> 37:48.625
Please.
Help me. Please.

38:21.875 --> 38:25.707
Is she okay?
She's sleeping.

38:25.708 --> 38:28.290
The E.R. doc gave her something
for the pain. It knocked her out.

38:28.291 --> 38:31.499
But she's
gonna be all right?

38:31.500 --> 38:33.707
It's a fracture.

38:33.708 --> 38:35.625
It's gonna
take some time.

38:36.708 --> 38:41.333
God. I'm sorry.
I'm so...

38:43.041 --> 38:46.165
I just don't
understand.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.707
I don't understand why you'd
go to see somebody like rack.

38:48.708 --> 38:53.541
And I certainly don't understand
why you dragged dawn into it.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.375
I don't know.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.499
The magic. I...

38:59.500 --> 39:02.041
I thought I had it under control.
And then...

39:02.834 --> 39:04.791
I didn't.

39:04.792 --> 39:07.083
Because of Tara?

39:09.417 --> 39:13.458
No. It started
before she left.

39:16.542 --> 39:18.708
It's why she left.

39:22.291 --> 39:24.875
Seemed like things
were going so well.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.250
It was.

39:29.375 --> 39:31.416
But, I mean,

39:31.417 --> 39:34.499
if you could be...

39:34.500 --> 39:37.542
Plain old Willow or super
Willow, who would you be?

39:41.041 --> 39:45.791
I guess you don't actually have an
option on the whole super thing.

39:45.792 --> 39:48.040
Wil, there's nothing
wrong with you.

39:48.041 --> 39:49.999
You don't need magic
to be special.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.207
Don't I?

39:52.208 --> 39:54.916
I mean, Buffy,
who was I?

39:54.917 --> 39:56.875
Just some girl.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.667
Tara didn't even
know that girl.

40:02.125 --> 40:04.125
You are more
than some girl.

40:05.208 --> 40:08.165
And Tara
wants you to stop.

40:08.166 --> 40:11.457
She loves you.
We don't know that.

40:11.458 --> 40:13.708
I know that.
I promise you.

40:15.083 --> 40:17.041
I just...

40:19.041 --> 40:20.958
It took me away
from myself.

40:20.959 --> 40:23.207
I was...

40:23.208 --> 40:25.083
Free.

40:27.875 --> 40:32.666
I get that.
More than you...

40:32.667 --> 40:34.542
But it's wrong.

40:35.708 --> 40:37.667
People get hurt.

40:40.208 --> 40:43.499
If something had
happened to dawn tonight...

40:43.500 --> 40:45.457
Something worse...

40:45.458 --> 40:47.999
I know.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.500
No, I don't think you do.

40:52.041 --> 40:54.791
I-I...
I was out of my mind.

40:54.792 --> 40:58.083
I-I did things.
I can't even...

41:00.875 --> 41:03.917
It won't happen again.
I promise.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.375
No more spells.
I'm finished.

41:11.875 --> 41:14.290
Good.

41:14.291 --> 41:16.165
I think it's right...

41:16.166 --> 41:18.332
To give it up.

41:18.333 --> 41:21.707
No matter
how good it feels.

41:21.708 --> 41:23.874
It's not worth it...

41:23.875 --> 41:26.458
Not if it messes
with the people I love.

41:30.417 --> 41:33.332
Magic wasn't all great.

41:33.333 --> 41:36.749
I won't miss the nosebleeds
and the headaches and stuff.

41:36.750 --> 41:39.207
There you go.

41:39.208 --> 41:42.917
Or keeping stinky
yak cheese in my bra.

41:44.291 --> 41:48.749
Don't ask.
Now I don't have to.

41:48.750 --> 41:50.959
'Cause it's over.

41:52.625 --> 41:54.916
Exactly.

41:54.917 --> 41:57.458
It's over.

43:18.041 --> 43:19.875
Grr! Arrgh!
