00:42.655 --> 00:44.379
- Yeah.

00:44.448 --> 00:46.241
- Come with me.

00:50.448 --> 00:51.793
- Two flakes a horse.

00:51.862 --> 00:52.965
Then you muck
out the paddocks.

00:53.034 --> 00:55.241
But use a different
wheelbarrow.

00:55.310 --> 00:56.517
Green ones are for hay.

00:56.586 --> 00:58.793
Black for manure ...

00:58.862 --> 01:00.172
It wasn't my idea
to make you low man.

01:00.241 --> 01:02.413
So don't read too much into it.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.103
- I read it for what it is.

01:06.172 --> 01:09.241
It's fine.

01:09.310 --> 01:11.137
I deserve it.

01:11.206 --> 01:13.379
- Might need it,
but you don't deserve it.

01:15.586 --> 01:17.655
Just lose yourself
in the work, Jamie.

01:17.724 --> 01:19.034
Try to forgive yourself
and move on.

01:19.103 --> 01:20.965
That's all you can do.

01:24.413 --> 01:26.413
- Do you forgive me?

01:27.689 --> 01:29.310
- I'm your brother, Jamie.

01:30.896 --> 01:32.413
- Didn't answer my question.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.758
- Yeah, I did.

01:49.655 --> 01:52.379
- [gasps]

01:55.206 --> 01:56.275
[groans]

02:07.034 --> 02:08.620
[sighs]

02:49.862 --> 02:53.034
[theme music]

04:01.896 --> 04:03.206
- Hey, we should wait
for everyone else.

04:03.275 --> 04:04.862
- Grandpa never makes me wait.

04:04.931 --> 04:06.344
- You're waiting.

04:11.862 --> 04:15.068
- If you wait for everyone
to sit at this table,

04:15.137 --> 04:16.551
you'll never eat.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.620
- Told ya.

04:41.724 --> 04:44.275
- How you feelin', honey?

04:44.344 --> 04:46.413
- Like I just left
the fucking spa, Dad.

05:06.758 --> 05:08.586
- Hey Gator...
- Yeah?

05:08.655 --> 05:11.275
- Would you mind making me
a smoothie please?

05:11.344 --> 05:12.655
- Sure.
What kind of smoothie?

05:12.724 --> 05:16.379
- Two scoops of ice cream,
three shots of vodka...

05:16.448 --> 05:19.206
- Two scoops, three shots.
Got it.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.310
- And would you mind bringing
it to me on the porch?

05:21.379 --> 05:23.551
- Of course.
- Please.

05:32.275 --> 05:34.413
You should see the other guy.

05:40.482 --> 05:42.034
- Excuse me.

06:00.965 --> 06:02.862
- Lecturing me on how I behave

06:02.931 --> 06:05.620
in front of the school teacher
would be a mistake daddy.

06:08.965 --> 06:11.620
What are we gonna
tell Jason's parents?

06:11.689 --> 06:14.103
- Jason's family is not
my concern, sweetheart.

06:14.172 --> 06:16.206
You are.

06:32.620 --> 06:35.103
- [inhales deeply]

06:37.586 --> 06:40.896
- Our grandfathers
camped right here.

06:40.965 --> 06:44.758
Slept on the ground.

06:44.827 --> 06:47.965
Hunted this valley.

06:48.034 --> 06:51.586
For ten thousand years.

06:51.655 --> 06:54.724
Then John Dutton's grandfather
built a house on it.

06:54.793 --> 06:56.620
Called it theirs.

06:57.862 --> 07:02.275
- Maybe we'll sleep
here again someday.

07:02.344 --> 07:05.103
Beth: What are they doing?

07:05.172 --> 07:08.344
- I think they call that
"coveting" in the Bible.

07:20.344 --> 07:23.620
- What are you up to?

07:23.689 --> 07:25.862
- I'm gonna finish what they
started with you, honey.

07:30.172 --> 07:31.965
- Your smoothie, Miss Beth.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.137
- Bless you.

08:01.103 --> 08:03.241
- The Becks do that to you?

08:07.103 --> 08:09.413
- My face was just
the appetizer.

08:12.827 --> 08:15.344
- Oh...
I'm sorry.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.448
- What doesn't kill us, Dan...

08:18.517 --> 08:20.793
- I don't believe that.

08:20.862 --> 08:23.206
I don't believe
it makes us stronger.

08:23.275 --> 08:26.172
Harder, perhaps.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.413
- Hard is the goal.

08:30.482 --> 08:32.344
- I don't think you can get
much harder.

08:32.413 --> 08:33.655
- I'm shooting for Teflon.

08:33.724 --> 08:35.551
- [chuckles]

08:38.827 --> 08:40.413
- I understand your father
better now,

08:40.482 --> 08:42.344
being here
on this ranch.

08:42.413 --> 08:46.689
You, too, I think.

08:47.758 --> 08:50.827
- That's interesting.

08:50.896 --> 08:54.448
When I'm here,
I understand me less.

09:09.344 --> 09:11.586
- Thank you for coming.

09:11.655 --> 09:13.965
Now you know what
they did to me.

09:14.034 --> 09:16.482
- They did something
similar to me.

09:16.551 --> 09:20.689
- Mm? What did they do to you?

09:20.758 --> 09:23.172
- They pulled my liquor license.

09:23.241 --> 09:25.931
They're putting me
out of business.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.551
I don't see the logic in it.

09:27.620 --> 09:28.827
Attacking all three of us.

09:28.896 --> 09:31.620
- They want you to leave.

09:31.689 --> 09:34.448
They want him to quit building,
and they want me to make him.

09:41.586 --> 09:46.172
At this point,I say we all
have played fairly dirty.

09:46.241 --> 09:48.896
But no one's attacked my family
on behalf of your business.

09:48.965 --> 09:53.000
And No one's attacked yours
on behalf of mine.

09:56.275 --> 10:00.586
- Nothing any of us say here
is gonna change our goals.

10:00.655 --> 10:03.689
Our paths will always collide.

10:03.758 --> 10:07.241
We fight.
One of us will win.

10:07.310 --> 10:09.827
But you've been
a good enemy, John.

10:09.896 --> 10:11.655
A fair enemy.

10:11.724 --> 10:14.586
- I don't know
if I agree with fair,

10:14.655 --> 10:16.620
but you kept your fight with me.

10:16.689 --> 10:20.310
I respect that.

10:20.379 --> 10:23.379
- But now we face a new enemy.

10:23.448 --> 10:26.586
And they don't play fair.

10:26.655 --> 10:28.620
They'll find the thing
you care about most

10:28.689 --> 10:30.034
and they'll kill it.

10:33.724 --> 10:36.379
- So what do you
recommend we do?

10:36.448 --> 10:39.103
- I'm open to suggestions.

10:40.551 --> 10:42.724
- If you're going to be honest,

10:42.793 --> 10:45.310
be honest, John.

10:45.379 --> 10:48.655
You've already decided
what you're gonna do.

10:48.724 --> 10:50.620
You want us to be part of it

10:50.689 --> 10:52.965
so we don't use it against you.

10:53.034 --> 10:54.241
Just say it.

10:54.310 --> 10:57.931
So we can figure out how
to do it.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.310
Say it.

11:00.379 --> 11:02.172
- What do you want me to say?

11:02.241 --> 11:05.931
- I want you to say
that we should kill them.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.379
- Is that what you want?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.517
Just what
you want me to say.

11:21.586 --> 11:23.655
- You didn't tell me
what you wanted me here for.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.551
This is for my protection.

11:26.620 --> 11:27.827
All right?

11:27.896 --> 11:29.965
I'll say it.

11:30.034 --> 11:34.137
We should kill them.
We should kill them.

11:41.413 --> 11:42.862
- Hand it to me.

11:46.655 --> 11:48.413
This is like a blood oath,

11:48.482 --> 11:51.206
except we make the cut later.

11:51.275 --> 11:54.206
I'm not like you.

11:54.275 --> 11:57.758
If Montana's Livestock
Commissioner breaks the law,

11:57.827 --> 12:00.000
it doesn't change the
way an entire nation

12:00.068 --> 12:03.517
thinks about livestock
commissioners.

12:03.586 --> 12:05.551
If I break the law,

12:05.620 --> 12:09.827
every Chairman of every
National Tribe...

12:09.896 --> 12:12.517
suffers.

12:12.586 --> 12:14.689
My people suffer.

12:14.758 --> 12:18.931
And no one life is worth that.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.275
But I will say this,

12:22.344 --> 12:24.724
when things get lost
on the reservation,

12:24.793 --> 12:26.689
they don't get found.

12:26.758 --> 12:29.965
Because most of the time,
there's no one to look.

12:30.034 --> 12:34.551
I give you my word:
there will be no one to look.

12:36.517 --> 12:38.448
Your turn.

12:43.448 --> 12:45.137
- You didn't say it, John.

12:45.206 --> 12:47.689
- I don't have to say it.

12:47.758 --> 12:49.310
No one here's doing it.

12:51.172 --> 12:52.172
- I know some people in LA--

12:52.241 --> 12:54.931
No. Nobody from anywhere.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.068
If I need your help--
either one of you,

12:57.137 --> 12:58.965
I'll expect you to give it.

12:59.034 --> 13:00.172
No questions asked.

13:25.034 --> 13:26.241
- May I sit?
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.413 --> 13:39.965
We don't know
each other very well.

13:40.034 --> 13:43.551
- We don't know
each other at all.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.620
Don't worry, Monica.

13:45.689 --> 13:47.551
It wasn't my father
and it wasn't my boyfriend.

13:47.620 --> 13:50.172
This was business.

13:50.241 --> 13:52.586
- What kind of business
does that?

13:54.517 --> 13:57.448
- The family business.

13:57.517 --> 14:01.758
With that face, I recommend
you stick with teaching...

14:09.448 --> 14:10.862
Don't judge us

14:10.931 --> 14:13.862
for the way we protect
the thing we're giving you.

14:13.931 --> 14:15.275
- I'm not judging.

14:15.344 --> 14:18.689
I just...

14:18.758 --> 14:21.724
I don't understand this place.

14:21.793 --> 14:24.137
- I wouldn't try doing that,
either.

14:43.931 --> 14:45.586
- Tell you what,
I'll call you back later.

14:57.344 --> 14:58.793
Ahhhhh!

15:12.206 --> 15:13.931
- You know, this gets any
bigger, people gonna--

15:14.000 --> 15:15.517
gonna start to notice.

15:20.413 --> 15:23.862
So how far do you want
to take this thing now?

15:23.931 --> 15:26.758
- He's not leaving us
much choice.

15:26.827 --> 15:29.000
We take this all the way.

15:30.689 --> 15:34.241
- Well this thing doesn't
just stop with John Dutton.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.931
He runs this thing
with his children.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.793
- [ shouting ]
I said...

15:37.862 --> 15:41.862
[ calmer ]
all the way.

15:41.931 --> 15:44.344
- Alright.

15:44.413 --> 15:45.931
So who do you wanna start with?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.586
- The one he loves the most.

16:06.862 --> 16:07.965
- I wanna do it.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.068
- We'll get you a chance, buddy.

16:09.137 --> 16:12.793
This takes a lot of practice.

16:12.862 --> 16:14.931
Moment of truth.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Whoah.

16:38.551 --> 16:41.724
That it?
That all you got?

16:41.793 --> 16:43.586
You've got a good mind,
don't you?

16:43.655 --> 16:45.379
- I picked a good one.

16:45.448 --> 16:46.379
- You sure did, buddy.

16:46.448 --> 16:48.344
- Everyone just disappeared.

16:48.413 --> 16:51.586
House is so big you can't tell
when someone leaves it.

16:51.655 --> 16:53.586
- You get used to that.

16:55.275 --> 16:58.172
Hey.

16:58.241 --> 17:00.517
Don't do that.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.793
Don't have doubts.

17:02.862 --> 17:04.000
- I don't have doubts.

17:04.068 --> 17:05.896
I have worries.

17:05.964 --> 17:08.103
- Don't have those either.

17:08.172 --> 17:10.723
- How can I not?

17:10.792 --> 17:14.103
- By believing me.

17:14.172 --> 17:16.448
That I'm doing
what's best for us.

17:18.482 --> 17:22.413
I'm just asking you
to trust me.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.378
- I have class.

17:27.068 --> 17:28.550
- We didn't have school today.
It's a holiday.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.379
- It's a holiday
on the reservation.

17:30.448 --> 17:33.206
And we are very far
from the reservation.

17:33.275 --> 17:35.448
It's a field trip.

17:35.517 --> 17:37.413
I'll be home late.

17:37.482 --> 17:38.655
- How late?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.931
- Real late.

17:48.620 --> 17:49.724
- What do you have?

17:49.793 --> 17:51.758
- I got nothing, sir.

17:53.103 --> 17:55.482
I've been to every damn airport.

17:55.551 --> 17:57.689
No one rented a plane
to transport hay.

17:57.758 --> 18:00.172
I can't even find a feed store
that sells clover.

18:00.241 --> 18:03.241
Hell, I even ran Dan Jenkins'
name through the FAA database

18:03.310 --> 18:05.241
to see if he owned
a plane--nothing.

18:05.310 --> 18:07.172
This did just come through

18:07.241 --> 18:10.344
from the packing house in Butte.

18:16.551 --> 18:18.896
- Been right under
my goddamn nose.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.068
Look up Malcolm Beck
on the FAA's site.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.655
- Yes sir.

18:26.724 --> 18:28.551
- Out of Billings or Butte.

18:32.206 --> 18:35.827
- He's the authorized signer
for a Montana Gaming LLC,

18:35.896 --> 18:40.413
which has a Cheyenne 403
Cessna caravan cargo plane--

18:40.482 --> 18:41.931
- Three what?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.965
- Three Cessna
caravan cargo planes, sir.

18:44.034 --> 18:46.862
People use them for skydiving.

18:46.931 --> 18:48.827
He's got 'em hangared here
at the airfield in Billings.

18:51.275 --> 18:53.172
- He used his own plane...

18:53.241 --> 18:54.310
- Sir?

18:56.103 --> 18:57.758
- Nothing.

18:57.827 --> 18:59.137
I'll take it from here.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.344
- Yes sir.

19:11.172 --> 19:12.310
[music plays in distance]

How to get more.

Take more.

As long as it leads to more.

a home, Kayce.

houses than this room.

we can live in town.

a bigger apartment

26:01.896 --> 26:03.310

this every night.

27:54.482 --> 27:56.034
- Feel like you'd be better off
taking a bicycle.

Well, well, well.

30:06.344 --> 30:09.000

30:20.241 --> 30:22.344
- Can we send him
for cigarettes?

what I'm doing, quitter.

30:41.206 --> 30:43.068
Well?
Where is it?

30:55.413 --> 30:56.620
Jesus, Jimmy.

30:56.689 --> 31:00.000
I didn't know goat-fucking
paid so well.

31:00.068 --> 31:02.758
- We're done.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.413
Leave my grandfather alone.

31:06.655 --> 31:08.172
- Look whose balls
finally dropped.

31:09.310 --> 31:11.931
We're square
on the money, Jimmy,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.931
but your bitch still owes me

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
for that little bear
spray stunt.

31:18.068 --> 31:19.965
- How much is that gonna cost?

31:20.034 --> 31:24.103

31:24.172 --> 31:27.379
It's hard to put a price on it.

31:27.448 --> 31:29.206
Maybe you bring her over.

31:29.275 --> 31:31.034
We'll figure something out.

31:35.068 --> 31:39.413
Uh-oh, Jimmy's mad.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.655
Maybe you want to repay her
debt?

31:42.724 --> 31:44.517
How good do you suck?

31:48.310 --> 31:50.241
I'm just fucking with you,
Jimmy.

31:51.931 --> 31:55.137
Another grand
and she's off the hook.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.482
- I just gave you
all the money I have.

31:57.551 --> 32:01.310
- That looks like
it's worth something.

32:25.379 --> 32:29.310
- Are you gonna ride him today?

32:29.379 --> 32:31.724
- Probably not today, buddy.

32:31.793 --> 32:34.275
- Tomorrow?

32:34.344 --> 32:37.551
- Can't be in a hurry
with horses, buddy.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.172
- The day after tomorrow?

32:51.896 --> 32:54.862
- Spend most of my days
wondering why I bother,

32:54.931 --> 32:57.689
then see something like that.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.034
And it all comes back to me.

33:02.344 --> 33:04.379
Don't like it here, do you?

33:05.793 --> 33:08.724
- I love this.

33:08.793 --> 33:10.413

33:10.482 --> 33:13.241
how often is it this?

to be a part of it.

33:21.310 --> 33:24.517
These things don't
happen in the city.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.862
- Of course they do, Monica.

33:26.931 --> 33:28.551
Every day.

33:28.620 --> 33:30.482
The scale may be smaller.

33:30.551 --> 33:32.517
It may only be
your purse or your car

33:32.586 --> 33:34.448
someone tries to take.

33:34.517 --> 33:39.206
But they try
with the same force.

You going to tell me those
things don't happen in Bozeman

33:41.862 --> 33:44.310
or the reservation?

33:44.379 --> 33:48.655
- No, I can't tell you that.

33:48.724 --> 33:50.931
- Give us a chance.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.758
That's all I ask.

33:53.827 --> 33:57.034
Can you do that?

33:57.103 --> 33:59.758
- I can do that.

34:09.551 --> 34:11.172
- You're supposed to be in bed.

34:11.241 --> 34:13.103
- Shit, I've slept more
in the last two days

34:13.172 --> 34:14.931
than I did all last year.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.068
- Yeah, well,
just take it easy.

34:17.137 --> 34:19.413
- I will.

34:19.482 --> 34:22.688

34:22.757 --> 34:26.000
- We're starting to have a few
too many things in common,
big fella.

34:26.068 --> 34:29.447
- You got any more of them
pain pills left over?

34:29.516 --> 34:32.068
If I take any more banamine,
I'm gonna fucking whinnie.

34:48.413 --> 34:49.551
- Thank you.

34:55.137 --> 34:56.793
I mean it.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.931
- I know you do, sir.
I know.

35:01.793 --> 35:03.862
- You close to being done there?

35:03.931 --> 35:06.758
Need a word.

35:06.827 --> 35:09.551
- Well we were
just getting started.

35:09.620 --> 35:12.896
- You know what, I'll take care
of him sir, all right?

35:12.965 --> 35:14.448
- I said easy.

35:14.517 --> 35:17.793
- Yeah well, Tate will look out
for me, won't you tate?

35:17.862 --> 35:19.827
Go on run over there.

35:33.068 --> 35:34.724
- The Becks have
their own plane.

35:37.103 --> 35:40.000
Is that useful information
to a soldier?

35:40.068 --> 35:41.379
- Where is it?

35:41.448 --> 35:44.965
- Private airfield in Billings.

35:45.034 --> 35:47.551
- Yeah.
It's useful.

35:50.034 --> 35:52.931
- Then use it.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.758
- How much do you want
to know about it?

35:55.827 --> 35:59.793
- For this?
Everything.

36:03.448 --> 36:05.758
- Set a meeting.

36:05.827 --> 36:08.793
Somewhere too far for a man
with a plane to drive.

36:11.655 --> 36:15.517
- It needs to happen
where we can control it.

36:15.586 --> 36:17.034
The ranch or the rez.

36:20.689 --> 36:22.172
- Set the meeting
in Jackson Hole.

36:22.241 --> 36:23.413
They'll fly right over us.

36:23.482 --> 36:26.482
- Alright.

36:29.482 --> 36:32.655
- Dan Jenkins has an SF guy
working for him.

36:32.724 --> 36:36.310
- Yeah. I met him.

36:36.379 --> 36:38.034
- I'm going to need
his help on this.

36:38.103 --> 36:42.896
- I don't know, Kayce.
I don't know.

36:42.965 --> 36:46.862
- Him involved,
Dan can't use it against us.

36:52.827 --> 36:56.793
I just want this
whole thing to be over.

36:56.862 --> 36:59.517
- I don't know if this game's
ever over, son.

37:02.793 --> 37:06.034
- Is it scared?
That why he runs?

37:06.103 --> 37:10.034
- No. It's instinct more
than anything, you know.

37:10.103 --> 37:12.586
With these wild horses,
you know they...

37:12.655 --> 37:14.931
they're trying to figure out
who the boss is,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.586
who they can trust.

37:16.655 --> 37:18.724
I mean a tourist will look at,
you know,

37:18.793 --> 37:20.310
a mustang that's running around
let's just say.

37:20.379 --> 37:24.655
and think that they're playing.
But they're not playing, Tate.

37:24.724 --> 37:26.689
They're seeing where
they stand in the world

37:26.758 --> 37:29.655
and who's their friend.

37:29.724 --> 37:32.827
Here. Let me zip you up.

37:32.896 --> 37:35.931
It's getting cold out here.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.103
Better?

37:40.172 --> 37:42.068
He sure is good looking
isn't he?

37:42.137 --> 37:44.034
- Yeah.

37:44.103 --> 37:47.758
- Wanna ride him today?

37:47.827 --> 37:50.241
Think your dad
would get pissed off?

37:50.310 --> 37:52.896
[chuckles]

37:52.965 --> 37:55.965
- Turns out he's just
a big teddy bear.

37:56.034 --> 37:57.689
Who knew.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.862
- Tell ya what.

38:02.931 --> 38:05.689
I'm gonna work with you
on this horse.

38:05.758 --> 38:07.793
We're gonna sort it out.

38:07.862 --> 38:09.482
Make him the best horse
we got around here.

38:39.103 --> 38:43.724
- Look how well
shoveling shit suits you.

38:43.793 --> 38:45.275
Shocker.

38:48.241 --> 38:52.758
You know one day, Jamie,

38:52.827 --> 38:56.275
as much as it fuckin'
astonishes me...

39:00.517 --> 39:03.482
someone will love you.

39:05.793 --> 39:08.206
And you'll love somebody.

39:11.206 --> 39:14.482
And I can't wait
to take that from you.

39:19.689 --> 39:24.068
Even if I have to kill it
with my bare hands,

39:24.137 --> 39:26.896
I will take it from you.

40:14.103 --> 40:16.034
- Excuse me.

40:16.103 --> 40:17.379
I'm all turned around.

40:17.448 --> 40:19.655
This road lead to the park?

40:19.724 --> 40:22.206
- No, should've stayed on 89--

40:39.172 --> 40:40.586
- I think that's the first time

40:40.655 --> 40:42.551
I've ever seen you be outfoxed.

40:42.620 --> 40:44.931
- I'm not outfoxed.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.793
He asked me to give it a chance,

40:46.862 --> 40:49.620
Tate's playing with his...
new fucking horse.

40:49.689 --> 40:50.827
- Outfoxed.

41:03.241 --> 41:06.068
- I just don't like
being in the bedroom.

41:06.137 --> 41:07.758
The bathroom's
a whole different story,

41:07.827 --> 41:10.206
I mean a girl can
get used to this.

41:11.758 --> 41:14.172
- Well let's just move
into the bathroom then.

41:14.241 --> 41:16.551
Lord knows there's
enough room in here.

41:19.379 --> 41:22.655
- This house makes me want
to put a baby in every room.

41:22.724 --> 41:26.000
Kids running everywhere.

41:26.068 --> 41:28.517
It needs chaos
to make it a home.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.965
- Yeah, I agree.

41:31.034 --> 41:33.586
- But then they grow up and...

41:33.655 --> 41:35.586
it's quiet again.

41:35.655 --> 41:38.137
This place becomes a tomb.

41:38.206 --> 41:41.655
- Then we give it away
like he did

41:41.724 --> 41:43.137
and Tate and his wife
move in here

41:43.206 --> 41:45.068
and then they do the same thing.

41:48.034 --> 41:50.137
- You've got a lot
of work to do, buddy.

41:50.206 --> 41:51.793
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hm.

41:51.862 --> 41:54.551
- Better get to it.

41:56.482 --> 41:59.275
[knock on door]
John Dutton: Kayce.

41:59.344 --> 42:01.103
- Shit.

42:01.172 --> 42:02.482
- Well then there's
the downside

42:02.551 --> 42:05.172
of having three generations
on the same ranch.

42:09.551 --> 42:11.275
- Kayce.

42:16.413 --> 42:18.172
Get dressed.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.137
- Get dressed.

42:57.862 --> 42:59.724
- Where am I going?

42:59.793 --> 43:02.241
- I don't know.

43:20.448 --> 43:22.517
- Get in the back.

43:56.965 --> 43:58.310
- What is this?

44:01.241 --> 44:02.344
- You're a lawyer tonight.

44:06.551 --> 44:08.793
Where'd you think
I was taking you?

44:17.241 --> 44:19.172
- It's obviously
a tribal matter.

44:19.241 --> 44:21.689
A tribal employee
on tribal land.

44:21.758 --> 44:23.689
- He was shot on a country road.

44:23.758 --> 44:25.448
It's a fucking county issue.

44:25.517 --> 44:27.344
- We'll see what
the chairman thinks.

44:27.413 --> 44:28.724
- You do that.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.068
- I'll be damned if this
doesn't look like you.

44:41.137 --> 44:42.793
- This wasn't me
and you know it.

44:42.862 --> 44:44.241
- I'm not saying it was you.

44:44.310 --> 44:47.344
I'm saying it looks like you.

44:47.413 --> 44:50.172
You've been real clear about
how you feel about this casino.

44:53.517 --> 44:55.344
- Now we know who did it.

44:56.862 --> 44:59.068
Witnesses?
- No.

44:59.137 --> 45:01.689
No evidence other than
the bullet hole in his head.

45:01.758 --> 45:03.172
- So, now an investigation.

45:03.241 --> 45:05.758
- Yep.

45:05.827 --> 45:08.344
- That halts construction.

45:08.413 --> 45:09.896
- Look. I know them.

45:09.965 --> 45:11.068
And they are not gonna wait
around for a reaction.

45:11.137 --> 45:12.448
They're already
planning what's next.

45:12.517 --> 45:15.620
So I highly recommend you
make a public statement

45:15.689 --> 45:18.586
saying you're halting it
on your own.

45:18.655 --> 45:19.896
Even that's not gonna stop him,

45:19.965 --> 45:21.172
but it'll slow him down.

45:21.241 --> 45:22.862
And give you time
to figure out a move.

45:22.931 --> 45:24.172
Because right now,
you don't have one.

45:24.241 --> 45:25.965
And he's gonna
take a swing at you next.

45:26.034 --> 45:28.551
- He already took one.

45:28.620 --> 45:32.034
- John, you need to watch out
here 'cuz another one's coming.

45:32.103 --> 45:33.551
If he sees deputies
outside your place.

45:33.620 --> 45:36.172
It'll be me he's after next.
I can get State Police--

45:36.241 --> 45:37.896
- Nothing would please me more

45:37.965 --> 45:40.206
than them coming on my ranch.

45:40.275 --> 45:41.551
I'll leave the gate open.

45:51.931 --> 45:55.103
We're taking care
of this right now.

45:58.068 --> 46:00.965
[phone rings]

46:10.448 --> 46:12.241
- Yeah.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.103
John.

46:18.172 --> 46:21.275
What a surprise.

46:21.344 --> 46:25.655
Jackson Hole?

46:25.724 --> 46:28.655
During the day.
In the square.

46:28.724 --> 46:32.275
For all the world to see.

46:32.344 --> 46:33.862
Looking forward to it.
