00:00.644 --> 00:03.094
Now, please don't tell me we've got the only
medic who can't stand the sight of blood.

00:03.144 --> 00:05.394
Bashira. That's a lovely name.

00:05.444 --> 00:07.614
- I'm Molly.
- Molly?

00:07.664 --> 00:10.014
That kid is spotting for the
Taliban and reporting back.

00:11.624 --> 00:13.693
- Man down!
- That's Smurf!

00:13.744 --> 00:16.134
Sir, he's losing blood. I can get to him.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.414
Molly!

00:18.464 --> 00:21.894
I was a dickhead. I'm telling
you, I've learnt a big lesson.

00:21.944 --> 00:23.934
I'm going to come back to you.

00:23.984 --> 00:26.054
- Well done, Dawes.
- Thank you, Sir.

00:26.104 --> 00:27.614
You're an excellent medic.

00:27.664 --> 00:29.984
You're proving yourself.

00:44.824 --> 00:45.864
Bashira.

00:47.224 --> 00:48.774
You dropped this at the market.

00:48.824 --> 00:50.064
I've been chasing you.

00:51.224 --> 00:52.974
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

00:53.024 --> 00:54.854
That's what we're here for.

00:54.904 --> 00:58.654
- Sang Chill Bazi?
- Yeah, Sang Chill Bazi.

00:58.704 --> 01:00.414
Come on, then. Oh...

01:00.464 --> 01:04.294
Right, last time you beat me,
so this time the revenge is mine.

01:04.343 --> 01:07.144
Right.

01:08.824 --> 01:10.744
I'm rubbish at this.

01:13.224 --> 01:15.934
Ah, you beat me again!

01:15.984 --> 01:18.174
I tell you what...

01:18.224 --> 01:20.774
the winner gets a sweet.

01:20.824 --> 01:24.254
These are pang. My mum
sends these from London.

01:24.304 --> 01:26.174
Pang?

01:26.224 --> 01:27.944
Take these for Ron.

01:30.584 --> 01:32.024
Later on?

01:33.424 --> 01:36.094
I'm teaching you proper,
good English here, Bashira.

01:36.144 --> 01:38.534
See, me and you, we're soul sisters.

01:38.584 --> 01:41.024
- Sisters?
- Yeah.

01:45.424 --> 01:47.854
You'd better get off to
school. You're going to be late.

01:47.904 --> 01:49.414
I was always late.

01:49.464 --> 01:51.574
I spent more time writing in the late book

01:51.624 --> 01:53.904
than I did in all my
other lessons put together.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.734
School.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.374
My father say no school.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.934
Why would he say that?

02:12.944 --> 02:15.104
Dawes!

02:19.544 --> 02:22.494
Excuse me a second, when did Her
Majesty die and make you the Queen?

02:22.544 --> 02:22.968
Sir?

02:22.969 --> 02:25.210
You are not in charge.
You do not wander off.

02:26.624 --> 02:29.694
- Sorry, Sir...
- Do you realise how much danger you put yourself in?

02:29.744 --> 02:33.054
- She'd dropped her scarf, I was...
- You thought you'd risk your life to pick it up?

02:33.104 --> 02:35.414
Sorry, Sir. It's just she's
become my little friend...

02:35.464 --> 02:37.934
You do not involve yourself
in the lives of the locals.

02:37.984 --> 02:41.374
They must not become dependent on us in
any way, shape or form. Do you understand?

02:41.424 --> 02:44.984
- Yes, Sir.
- More importantly, you don't put yourself in jeopardy.

03:35.204 --> 03:38.814
This dust is like smoking
40 fags a day, man!

03:38.864 --> 03:41.148
So with the 40 you actually
smoke, that makes 80.

03:41.149 --> 03:42.149
Yeah.

03:42.504 --> 03:44.824
I probably should quit, shouldn't I?

03:48.184 --> 03:49.214
Look who it is!

03:49.264 --> 03:52.254
Our very own number one cock
muppet is back on the firm.

03:52.304 --> 03:55.494
All right, shitheads!

03:58.104 --> 04:00.534
Right, who wants to see
my rusty bullet hole?

04:00.584 --> 04:02.614
Fingers first!

04:02.664 --> 04:04.814
Molls, you want to cop a feel?

04:04.864 --> 04:07.814
It's a shame he didn't shoot you in
the head, put us all out of our misery.

04:09.224 --> 04:12.374
- Proper rinsed, Smurf!
- Oh, so she's flavour of the month now, is she?

04:12.424 --> 04:14.294
Yes, she is. Deal with it.

04:21.464 --> 04:24.174
Glad to have you back.

04:24.324 --> 04:26.574
I can't tell you how
glad I am to be back, Sir.

04:26.624 --> 04:29.974
- I won't let you down again.
- Correct. You won't.

04:30.024 --> 04:33.334
- You were lucky it was just a flesh wound.
- I know, Sir.

04:33.384 --> 04:37.094
Having said that, with the blood you lost,
you would've died if it weren't for our medic.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.774
- I know that too, Sir.
- And more importantly,

04:39.824 --> 04:41.744
she risked her life to save yours.

04:43.264 --> 04:44.894
I made a mistake.

04:44.944 --> 04:46.654
We all make mistakes, Smurf.

04:46.704 --> 04:49.654
It's what we do to rectify them that
separates the shit from the clay.

04:49.704 --> 04:51.454
Don't worry about me, Sir.

04:51.504 --> 04:52.824
I'll prove my worth.

04:54.384 --> 04:56.814
As if "The Smurfoid
Returns" wasn't treat enough,

04:56.864 --> 05:00.614
by way of celebration, we have some
very special guests arriving tomorrow.

05:00.664 --> 05:01.670
Who's that, Sir?

05:01.671 --> 05:04.464
- I'm talking mega. Huge.
- What, Prince Harry?

05:04.704 --> 05:07.094
Prince Harry? He's gagging to get out here.

05:07.144 --> 05:09.974
Are you telling us you've
bagged us the Royal ginge, Sir?

05:10.024 --> 05:12.414
Ask me no questions, I'll
tell you no lies, Dawes.

05:12.464 --> 05:14.814
My mum says I've got more
than a passing resemblance...

05:14.864 --> 05:16.534
Shut up!

05:16.584 --> 05:19.854
- Come on, Smurf, let's see your rusty bullet hole.
- Yeah, man!

05:19.904 --> 05:20.934
All right, all right.

05:20.984 --> 05:23.294
Check it, boys. Gather round, gather round.

05:25.864 --> 05:27.214
Excuse me, Sir.

05:27.264 --> 05:31.014
If it is the Ginger Ninja, then why haven't we
had royal security round to check everything?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.374
- I haven't said who it is, have I, Dawes?
- It is him.

05:33.424 --> 05:35.692
I can tell with you being all coy,

05:35.693 --> 05:37.680
like you're not supposed to say
anything, but you can't help it.

05:37.684 --> 05:39.744
I'm like that.

05:42.704 --> 05:44.894
The doctor at Bastion says

05:44.944 --> 05:48.374
the medic has to rub baby oil into
my bullet hole every hour or I'll die.

05:48.424 --> 05:51.694
- Looks like you're going to die then.
- Charming. Cup of tea?

05:51.744 --> 05:53.494
You owe me more than that.

05:53.544 --> 05:57.374
That's true, saving my life has got to be
worth at least a cup of tea and a bacon butty.

05:57.424 --> 06:01.064
Don't push it, mate. Your life
ain't worth a whole bacon butty.

06:05.584 --> 06:07.424
I'm there for you. Molls.

06:16.424 --> 06:17.494
What?

06:17.544 --> 06:20.894
Nothing. It's just that whenever
anyone says, "I'm there for you",

06:20.944 --> 06:23.854
it just makes me laugh. It's just
one of them expressions, innit?

06:23.904 --> 06:27.014
Yeah, I'm just letting you
know, like, if you need me...

06:27.064 --> 06:28.494
You're there.

06:28.544 --> 06:29.934
Yeah.

06:29.984 --> 06:31.944
For me?

06:40.544 --> 06:43.934
- So, you got him to like you now, then?
- What are you talking about?

06:43.984 --> 06:47.854
Well, you know, he was a bit
sort of... offish with you.

06:47.904 --> 06:49.584
Are you making that tea, or what?

07:06.304 --> 07:08.774
Kinders, if you go left
and hug the poppy fields,

07:08.824 --> 07:11.134
- we can get into the village that way.
- Sir!

07:11.184 --> 07:13.224
Swing it left here.

07:14.344 --> 07:16.854
"In Flanders fields the poppies blow... "

07:16.904 --> 07:18.614
Different type of poppies here, Sir.

07:18.664 --> 07:22.014
More smackheads here than
Liverpool, eh, Brains?

07:22.064 --> 07:23.494
Oh, don't stereotype us,

07:23.544 --> 07:26.414
you leak-eating,
daffodil-growing sheep-shagger.

07:26.464 --> 07:28.334
Circle of rocks ahead, Sir.

07:28.384 --> 07:29.824
Nude-Nut, you're up.

07:32.664 --> 07:34.334
My shout, Sir.

07:34.384 --> 07:36.624
Not on your first full day back, Smurf.

07:49.904 --> 07:51.704
I'm all right, Sir.

07:53.424 --> 07:54.574
I know you are, Smurf.

07:54.624 --> 07:57.814
It's just that it's
your first full day back.

07:57.864 --> 08:01.734
You just don't want to have to tell
my mum she's lost another one, Sir.

08:01.784 --> 08:05.454
- Well, yeah, there is that.
- Anything happens to me,

08:05.504 --> 08:07.974
you might have to move
to Newport yourself, Sir.

08:08.024 --> 08:10.904
That truly is a fate
worse than death, Smurf.

08:12.224 --> 08:14.054
* I'm Newport till I die *

08:14.104 --> 08:16.014
* I'm Newport till I die *

08:16.064 --> 08:18.494
* I knows I am, I'm sure I am *

08:18.544 --> 08:20.694
* I'm Newport till I die. *

08:20.744 --> 08:22.574
You sad Welsh tosser.

08:22.624 --> 08:24.974
They call Newport the Venice of Wales.

08:25.024 --> 08:27.654
- Who does, Smurf?
- My Aunt Linda, if you must know.

08:27.704 --> 08:28.894
Although she's never been to Venice,

08:28.944 --> 08:32.234
but she has got a tattoo
of a gondola... on her arse.

08:33.384 --> 08:35.453
'All clear here, Sir.'

08:35.504 --> 08:37.144
All right, lads, close in.

08:38.664 --> 08:42.854
Sir, I will be able to resume
my duties as lead man, Sir?

08:42.904 --> 08:44.344
Well, I hope so, Smurf.

08:45.584 --> 08:47.784
Lads, fall in on me.

09:08.264 --> 09:11.014
That dicker's still around, then, is she?

09:11.064 --> 09:13.774
Planted any devices around here lately?

09:13.824 --> 09:15.374
Shut up, Smurf.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.294
- What?
- Trapping off.

09:17.344 --> 09:18.894
I'm just saying.

09:18.944 --> 09:23.344
It's funny how wherever we are,
she seems to pop up like a meerkat.

09:25.304 --> 09:27.934
She does seem to be ever
present on our patrols.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.694
I'm right, aren't I, boss?

09:29.744 --> 09:31.814
Something about her
that smells a bit rotten.

09:31.864 --> 09:35.624
If she is the one you saw in the
minefield, we should keep an eye on her.

09:38.224 --> 09:40.374
Oh, you're back all right.

09:40.424 --> 09:44.544
I'm talking sense, Molls, and you knows it.

09:51.464 --> 09:54.464
Bashira, are you OK?

09:55.624 --> 09:57.134
Well, what is it?

09:57.184 --> 10:00.304
I won't let anyone hurt you, OK?

10:02.864 --> 10:04.574
Why aren't you going to school?

10:04.624 --> 10:07.144
That's the reason we're here.

10:09.664 --> 10:11.494
I... I must leave.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.264
I must go away.

10:14.504 --> 10:17.494
- Go where?
- My father has said.

10:17.544 --> 10:19.464
He can't just send you away, can he?

10:21.624 --> 10:24.734
I've been promised to a man.

10:24.784 --> 10:25.984
What?

10:27.104 --> 10:29.624
What do you mean, promised?

10:30.744 --> 10:33.784
To be married. I must leave.

10:37.464 --> 10:39.584
Is that what you want?

10:44.744 --> 10:46.064
Get down!

10:48.624 --> 10:50.294
Get down!

10:50.344 --> 10:52.454
- To your right!
- Watch your back.

10:52.504 --> 10:55.224
I think it came from the
school over there, Corporal.

11:00.944 --> 11:03.064
I don't understand, why the school?

11:04.864 --> 11:09.774
The teacher says two Taliban came
in, fired at the walls and went.

11:09.824 --> 11:11.694
So who was in here? Was anybody hurt?

11:11.744 --> 11:14.694
The elder was in his office, he
came but they didn't harm him.

11:14.744 --> 11:16.654
The children ain't coming back.

11:16.704 --> 11:21.934
He thinks the presence of the
soldiers has only made things worse.

11:21.984 --> 11:24.454
He says this is just the first.

11:24.504 --> 11:26.024
The first?

11:27.144 --> 11:29.104
First thing they do.

11:35.944 --> 11:37.294
Dawes.

11:37.344 --> 11:38.374
Hey!

11:38.424 --> 11:40.574
- Is that for me, Sir?
- No.

11:42.424 --> 11:44.184
But the letter on the top is.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.294
Ah, it's from my sister,

11:47.344 --> 11:49.654
so you can stick that parcel up your arse.

11:49.704 --> 11:52.054
This is better. Sir.

11:52.104 --> 11:53.574
I doubt that, Dawes.

11:53.624 --> 11:57.574
Gentlemen, this parcel is a
package of mine from my mummy!

11:57.624 --> 11:59.614
While you lot are sweating your nads off,

11:59.664 --> 12:04.534
I will be bathing on the steps of
my very own luxury swimming pool.

12:05.944 --> 12:07.174
Two volunteers?

12:07.224 --> 12:10.294
One to blow it up and one to
get the water and fill it up.

12:10.344 --> 12:12.214
Nude-Nut, Baz Vegas!

12:12.264 --> 12:16.544
Oh, how I adore a keen and eager soldier!

12:17.824 --> 12:18.934
Who's next?

12:18.984 --> 12:21.704
Dangleberries. A heavy one.

12:27.344 --> 12:28.864
What's all that about, Sir?

12:33.544 --> 12:34.784
I don't know.

12:35.984 --> 12:37.264
Let's find out.

12:52.864 --> 12:54.544
You making chai?

13:00.024 --> 13:02.494
I take that as a yes?

13:02.544 --> 13:06.664
- You want chai?
- That'd be lovely. If you're offering?

13:18.224 --> 13:21.024
You, Sir, are a scholar and a gent.

13:22.424 --> 13:24.077
Do you know anything about what happened

13:24.078 --> 13:28.814
- up at the school this morning?
- What happened? At the school?

13:29.064 --> 13:30.864
You don't know?

13:32.944 --> 13:34.894
Why should I know?

13:34.944 --> 13:38.864
The Taliban went in and
fired bullets into the walls.

13:42.784 --> 13:44.944
Have you got a chai for our medic?

13:47.704 --> 13:49.254
The female?

13:49.304 --> 13:52.614
Well, we let them drink
tea where we come from.

13:52.664 --> 13:56.064
I know, mental or what?

14:13.624 --> 14:14.744
All this...

14:16.184 --> 14:18.624
... just to get the
children to go to school?

14:19.824 --> 14:22.384
You got a problem with that, soldier?

14:26.894 --> 14:30.724
Yeah, that's why we're here, to make
sure the children can go to school.

14:30.774 --> 14:33.324
But they used to go to
school before you arrive.

14:33.374 --> 14:34.884
The boys did, yeah.

14:34.934 --> 14:36.254
And now no-one will.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.654
So...

14:41.254 --> 14:44.094
... what have you achieved?

14:46.574 --> 14:47.934
You go soon...

14:49.694 --> 14:52.164
... and everything will go back to normal.

14:52.214 --> 14:55.174
What exactly counts as
normal round here, then?

14:56.814 --> 15:00.254
Your normal isn't our normal.

15:01.774 --> 15:05.374
And when you go, we will still be here.

15:08.894 --> 15:11.494
Dawes... work to do, move.

15:20.814 --> 15:23.124
We're supposed to be on the same side,

15:23.174 --> 15:25.844
- but sometimes it really doesn't feel like that.
- Agreed.

15:25.894 --> 15:29.124
Did you see his face when you said
about just the boys going to school?

15:29.174 --> 15:30.924
See, when it all goes back to normal,

15:30.974 --> 15:33.724
like what he's talking about,
Bashira don't stand a chance.

15:33.774 --> 15:35.844
- Repeat after me. Do...
- Do.

15:35.894 --> 15:36.823
- ... Not...
- ... Not...

15:36.824 --> 15:37.634
- ... Get...
- ... Get...

15:37.635 --> 15:38.605
... In-fucking-volved.

15:39.254 --> 15:42.364
Because I need you 100% by my side.

15:42.414 --> 15:43.413
I am, Sir.

15:43.414 --> 15:45.362
You can't be, if you're worrying
about an individual child.

15:45.374 --> 15:47.164
I'm 100% by your side.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.694
Good.

15:50.134 --> 15:51.774
Now go and read your letter.

16:00.094 --> 16:01.604
Heavily armed insurgents

16:01.654 --> 16:04.524
are controlling the area around
the mountains and the village.

16:04.574 --> 16:06.884
The ANA will remain at the checkpoint here,

16:06.934 --> 16:09.124
and we will maintain a
presence in the village itself

16:09.174 --> 16:11.204
so that the kids can return back to school.

16:11.254 --> 16:14.964
They are planning more attacks
imminently. So be vigilant, guys.

16:15.014 --> 16:18.324
The buildings opposite
the school are empty.

16:18.374 --> 16:22.044
To the rear of the school is a
compound which we will also control.

16:22.094 --> 16:24.004
We need the children to go back to school

16:24.054 --> 16:26.684
or the entire mission here
has been a waste of time.

16:26.734 --> 16:28.204
We leave in two hours.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.054
Be ready.

16:39.014 --> 16:40.134
Sir...

16:41.134 --> 16:43.284
... who'd win a fight out
of you and Prince Harry?

16:43.334 --> 16:45.084
We'll find out later.

16:45.134 --> 16:48.564
Prince Harry isn't going
to be the mystery guest!

16:48.614 --> 16:51.684
I'm so nicking his beret
and bunging it on eBay!

16:51.734 --> 16:53.364
Benefits Street!

16:53.414 --> 16:56.884
I'm from Aston, it's completely
the other side of Birmingham!

16:56.934 --> 16:59.444
Listen up you shit-for-brain lady-parts.

16:59.494 --> 17:02.244
As soon as we get to the village
compound, we secure the outside.

17:02.294 --> 17:04.763
- Dawes, you go in and establish a med centre.
- Sir.

17:04.814 --> 17:06.134
- Understood?
- Sir!

17:12.493 --> 17:14.723
You can come to England now, can't you?

17:14.773 --> 17:16.124
What do you mean?

17:16.174 --> 17:17.574
After drawdown.

17:18.654 --> 17:19.804
Is that what you want?

17:19.854 --> 17:22.164
A peaceful Afghanistan is all I want.

17:22.214 --> 17:24.694
- Good luck with that one.
- Indeed.

17:28.614 --> 17:32.364
How can she be promised,
Qaseem? That's mad, innit?

17:32.414 --> 17:33.894
Welcome to my country.

17:35.974 --> 17:39.644
What did you do before
you come and work for us?

17:39.694 --> 17:44.444
I taught at the university
in Kabul. English literature.

17:44.494 --> 17:47.444
And working for us is
better than the university?

17:47.494 --> 17:50.374
I thought I could do more good.

17:52.214 --> 17:54.574
They killed my wife and daughter.

17:57.774 --> 17:59.294
Who, the Taliban?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.124
So what is the worst
that can happen to me now?

18:04.174 --> 18:06.414
There is no worst. I've already had it.

18:12.334 --> 18:15.214
Do you reckon Afghan will ever be peaceful?

18:25.854 --> 18:27.724
Yes. One day.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.924
I don't know when that
day is but, of course,

18:30.974 --> 18:33.124
one day Afghanistan will be peaceful

18:33.174 --> 18:35.844
and the most beautiful
place on the Earth to live.

18:35.894 --> 18:39.414
One day. And every day
is another day nearer.

19:06.774 --> 19:09.244
She is saying her daughter needs treatment.

19:09.294 --> 19:11.484
Well, tell her to take
her to a local hospital.

19:18.054 --> 19:20.284
She says she is looking
to you as medic to help.

19:20.334 --> 19:24.284
The local hospital is four hours
away, and she has no transport.

19:24.334 --> 19:29.244
- She's saying it's my fault, isn't she?
- Yes, she is, but it's not.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.844
A father hitting his child is wrong.

19:30.894 --> 19:33.124
As wrong in Afghanistan as
it is where you come from.

19:33.174 --> 19:35.564
She has to go to her own
hospital. Those are the rules.

19:35.614 --> 19:38.564
Yes, Sir. Understood, Sir.

19:38.614 --> 19:40.844
Can I at least examine the
eye to assess the damage?

19:40.894 --> 19:44.164
Sir, we have a responsibility.

19:44.214 --> 19:48.894
Please, Sir. It is my fault, if it
was because I was talking to her.

19:50.254 --> 19:53.894
Well, get the eye cleaned up and
then I never want to see her again.

19:55.414 --> 19:58.254
- You're not endearing yourself to me, Dawes.
- Thank you, Sir.

20:11.454 --> 20:15.084
I think you might going to
need a stitch in that, Bashira.

20:15.134 --> 20:16.484
Do you understand?

20:16.534 --> 20:19.204
Of course she doesn't
understand, I barely understood.

20:19.254 --> 20:22.564
- I thought your English was better than hers, Sir.
- Mine is.

20:22.614 --> 20:25.244
Yours... "Might going to need a stitch"?

20:25.294 --> 20:27.444
What's that even supposed to mean?

20:27.494 --> 20:29.284
She might going to need a stitch.

20:29.334 --> 20:33.374
I'll try putting butterfly
stitches in it to hold it together.

20:34.814 --> 20:39.004
She has come looking to you instead
of her local hospital. It's wrong.

20:39.054 --> 20:41.884
Sir, we have a duty of care
for loss of life, limb or eye.

20:41.934 --> 20:45.604
- Are you telling me the rules of the British Army now, are you?
- No, Sir.

20:45.654 --> 20:47.964
It's my fourth tour, Dawes,
and where it goes wrong

20:48.014 --> 20:50.324
is where soft fools start
to get personally involved.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.054
I'm not soft, Sir.

20:54.654 --> 20:59.204
Well, get her cleaned up, and then
she'll need to see her own doctor

20:59.254 --> 21:00.644
in her own hospital.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.614
Thank you, Sir.

21:08.694 --> 21:11.644
Who done this to your face, Bashira?

21:11.694 --> 21:13.374
Was it your dad?

21:16.094 --> 21:18.364
He say I love America.

21:18.414 --> 21:20.484
We're not American.

21:20.534 --> 21:22.454
We're British.

21:23.454 --> 21:25.414
It's a whole different ball bag.

21:27.694 --> 21:30.974
Look, I'm going to do all I can to
make sure this never happens again.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.414
That's what we're here for.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.964
To make sure there isn't a
next time for things like this.

21:39.014 --> 21:40.804
Do you understand?

21:40.854 --> 21:43.054
Hurry it up, Dawes!

21:44.574 --> 21:46.364
Can you get to a hospital?

21:46.414 --> 21:48.724
Show the doctor your
face, show him your eye.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.164
I'll try and keep the wound
tight for as long as I can.

21:51.214 --> 21:53.654
Thank you.

21:54.654 --> 21:57.004
I won't let them numpties hurt you.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.044
Numpties?

21:59.094 --> 22:02.934
- Dawes!
- I'm just coming, Sir.

22:04.334 --> 22:08.004
Look, we're here to stop the
Taliban from coming to the village.

22:08.054 --> 22:12.614
And they won't attack the
mountain if we're there too. OK?

22:17.814 --> 22:20.004
Do not go to the mountains.

22:20.054 --> 22:21.894
Why? What about the mountains?

22:23.254 --> 22:26.004
You must not go to the mountains tomorrow.

22:26.054 --> 22:29.014
Are you saying that something bad
is going to happen at the mountains?

22:31.734 --> 22:35.174
- Oi, gently!
- She must go.

23:25.014 --> 23:26.724
You all right?

23:26.774 --> 23:28.604
Why wouldn't I be?

23:28.654 --> 23:30.334
You just seem a bit...

23:32.694 --> 23:33.734
What's wrong?

23:35.334 --> 23:36.804
It's just Bashira.

23:36.854 --> 23:39.164
I think she was trying to
warn me about something.

23:39.214 --> 23:43.364
- Warn you about what?
- She told me not to go to the mountains so...

23:43.414 --> 23:44.724
the checkpoint, I suppose.

23:44.774 --> 23:49.524
But maybe she's just
trying to... I don't know.

23:49.574 --> 23:51.974
She said something's
going to happen at the CP?

23:54.054 --> 23:57.084
If you've got intelligence,
we need to tell James.

23:57.134 --> 23:59.644
There are Afghan soldiers up there.

23:59.694 --> 24:02.444
We're risking their lives
if we don't report it.

24:02.494 --> 24:03.534
Come on.

24:16.934 --> 24:18.254
Any chance of a word, Sir?

24:19.694 --> 24:22.524
You've got ten seconds, Smurf,
cos I am trying to relax here.

24:31.414 --> 24:34.164
- Our special guests! Yeah!
- Sir, we really need a word.

24:34.214 --> 24:35.884
Going to have to wait.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.564
Maybe Prince Harry's going to
have to wait, Sir, because...

24:51.654 --> 24:54.684
* God save our gracious Queen *

24:54.734 --> 24:59.124
* Long live our noble Queen *

24:59.174 --> 25:02.444
* God save our Queen... *

25:02.494 --> 25:04.604
Right.

25:04.654 --> 25:07.084
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have got a special treat

25:07.134 --> 25:08.524
arranged for you today.

25:08.574 --> 25:12.124
It is my great honour and
privilege to introduce to you...

25:12.174 --> 25:13.964
the Corps of Army Music!

25:16.614 --> 25:19.204
- Where's Harry, Sir?
- And that is just them warming up!

25:19.254 --> 25:21.644
Imagine how good they're going to be.

25:28.534 --> 25:29.894
Oh, yeah.

25:38.334 --> 25:41.284
Oh! Oh, sound familiar?

25:41.334 --> 25:42.644
Yeah!

25:42.694 --> 25:46.244
* Well, sometimes I go out by myself *

25:46.294 --> 25:50.174
* And I look across the water *

25:52.854 --> 25:56.004
* And I think of all the things *
* What you're doing *

25:56.054 --> 25:59.294
* And in my head I paint a picture *

26:02.694 --> 26:06.684
* Since I've come on home *
* Well, my body's been a mess *

26:06.734 --> 26:11.444
* And I've missed your ginger hair *
* And the way you like to dress *

26:11.494 --> 26:13.764
* Won't you come on over? *

26:13.814 --> 26:17.934
* Stop making a fool out of me *

26:19.254 --> 26:21.644
* Why don't you come on over, Valerie? *

26:21.694 --> 26:23.604
How'd you like my mandem, Nude-Nut?

26:23.654 --> 26:25.324
Banging, Sir!

26:25.374 --> 26:27.844
*... Valerie... *

26:27.894 --> 26:29.444
You impressed, Smurf?

26:29.494 --> 26:30.484
Sir.

26:30.534 --> 26:33.124
Excuse me, Sir. I think I've received intel

26:33.174 --> 26:35.774
about an attack on the
mountain CP tomorrow.

26:38.734 --> 26:41.934
- Sir.
- Ops tent now. Both of you.

26:44.654 --> 26:45.774
Sir.

26:48.534 --> 26:50.284
What makes you think it's credible?

26:50.334 --> 26:52.324
I've got a good relationship
with the kid, Sir.

26:52.374 --> 26:55.124
There's a possibility that
she's telling the truth.

26:55.174 --> 26:57.204
I'm pretty sure her dad's Taliban, Sir.

26:57.254 --> 26:59.444
You're making yourself vulnerable, Dawes.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.724
That is a possibility too,
but I was just being kind.

27:01.774 --> 27:04.524
She just told me. I
don't think she meant to.

27:04.574 --> 27:07.564
Sir, I could see it in her
eyes, she was telling the truth.

27:07.614 --> 27:09.564
Her eye was a right old
mess, though, to be fair.

27:09.614 --> 27:11.844
That kid really trusts her, Sir.

27:11.894 --> 27:14.614
You've obviously got close
enough so she can confide in you.

27:15.894 --> 27:17.364
And if that confidence leads to us

27:17.414 --> 27:19.724
being able to halt this
little group of insurgents...

27:19.774 --> 27:22.094
Then it could work out
brilliantly, Sir. Agreed.

27:23.774 --> 27:25.444
You two, wait outside.

27:25.494 --> 27:27.334
- Thank you, Sir.
- Thank you, Sir.

27:29.694 --> 27:31.484
Well, whichever way this works,

27:31.534 --> 27:33.364
an insurgent attack is clearly imminent.

27:33.414 --> 27:36.684
Either they're luring us in or
something else is going to happen.

27:36.734 --> 27:38.654
Certainly looks that way.

27:48.574 --> 27:50.174
How good are the music corps?

27:51.814 --> 27:55.004
* She said I love you, boy I love you so *

27:55.054 --> 27:57.884
* She said I love you, baby *
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... *

27:57.934 --> 28:00.284
What's going to happen to Bashira?

28:00.334 --> 28:01.964
What do you mean?

28:02.014 --> 28:03.984
Well, if she's right
and we act on her intel,

28:03.985 --> 28:05.640
things aren't going to
be very clever for her.

28:10.454 --> 28:12.654
Thanks for... for that in there.

28:14.294 --> 28:16.614
You saved my sorry arse out there.

28:17.974 --> 28:19.334
I owe you one.

28:21.014 --> 28:25.084
*... She said I love you, baby *
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... *

28:25.134 --> 28:28.324
I can take 2 Section to the
CP to support Captain Azizi

28:28.374 --> 28:30.724
and the Afghan Special
Forces that are flying in.

28:30.774 --> 28:32.604
I'll liaise with the Fire Support Group.

28:32.654 --> 28:34.414
Special Forces arriving 23:00.

28:40.414 --> 28:43.484
*... She said I love you
more than words can say *

28:43.534 --> 28:45.204
* She said I love you... *

28:45.254 --> 28:47.574
You did the right thing, Molls.

29:11.054 --> 29:12.614
Right, listen up.

29:13.854 --> 29:17.724
Relax. There's only about half
a dozen of them nasty Taliban

29:17.774 --> 29:21.334
and with this bad boy mini me, we
are not going to have a problem.

29:25.734 --> 29:27.724
You all right, Smurf?

29:27.774 --> 29:29.284
Why wouldn't I be?

29:29.334 --> 29:32.204
Well, the last time
you saw the mountain CP,

29:32.254 --> 29:35.244
you were hanging off the end
of a rope, bleeding to death.

29:35.294 --> 29:37.764
Casualty of war.

29:37.814 --> 29:39.684
Casualty of fuck-muppetry!

29:39.734 --> 29:41.614
Listen in, guys.

29:43.534 --> 29:46.404
01.30... we get there,
we dig in straight away.

29:46.454 --> 29:48.444
Remember, stay focused,

29:48.494 --> 29:51.254
stay alert, stay alive.

29:58.084 --> 30:01.444
Just get all that stuff
squared away over there, fellas.

30:03.524 --> 30:07.154
They think there was someone
in that compound yesterday.

30:07.204 --> 30:10.804
- Do they think they're still there?
- Not sure.

30:12.724 --> 30:14.154
Anything?

30:14.204 --> 30:16.314
- Kinders?
- Sir.

30:16.364 --> 30:18.404
I want locks down that compound now.

30:19.444 --> 30:22.324
- Helmets at all times, gentlemen.
- Sir.

30:47.484 --> 30:49.604
Nice kettle, mate.

30:54.124 --> 30:56.554
- Rolex.
- You sure about that, mate?

30:56.604 --> 30:59.004
If it is, they've spelt "Tuesday" wrong.

31:01.284 --> 31:02.834
Rolex.

31:02.884 --> 31:05.394
Won it from an American playing cards!

31:05.444 --> 31:07.474
Rolex. Proper Rolex.

31:07.524 --> 31:09.074
How old are you?

31:09.124 --> 31:10.215
18.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.870
Well, you're old enough to know
that Americans are full of shit.

31:30.724 --> 31:32.074
Sir.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.194
No, you're all right, Dawes.

31:34.244 --> 31:36.194
Talk about easy targets.

31:36.244 --> 31:38.674
I hope your intel's right on this one.

31:38.724 --> 31:41.794
Sir, if I am right, I'm a
bit worried about the girl.

31:41.844 --> 31:43.714
Maybe we've compromised her.

31:43.764 --> 31:46.364
- We'll worry about that later.
- Yes, Sir.

31:48.004 --> 31:50.204
- Dangles.
- Cheers, Dawesy.

31:55.004 --> 31:57.394
How are you feeling, Smurf?

31:57.444 --> 31:59.274
No heroics from me this time, Sir,

31:59.324 --> 32:01.634
if that's what you're worried about.

32:01.684 --> 32:05.274
- I promised your mum I'd wrap you up in cotton wool.
- Sir.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.954
Keep your helmet on and your head down.

32:08.004 --> 32:12.514
She's been surrounded by soldiers
her whole life. Imagine that.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.274
- Ain't normal, is it.
- Eh?

32:14.324 --> 32:15.684
Bashira.

32:17.004 --> 32:19.004
Yeah, well, we'll be gone soon.

32:20.004 --> 32:22.954
It's a shame we can't take
kids like her home with us.

32:23.004 --> 32:25.714
Sir, do you get the feeling
that Dawes is the type to bring

32:25.764 --> 32:28.754
- a donkey home from Spain?
- Like queen of the lost cause, Dawes?

32:28.804 --> 32:32.194
No, Sir, I'm hard as nails, me.

32:32.244 --> 32:35.154
It's just sometimes it
all seems a bit... unfair.

32:35.204 --> 32:36.834
It's luck.

32:36.884 --> 32:39.484
- What is, boss?
- Everything.

32:40.764 --> 32:43.474
The whole world and
everything in it. It's luck.

32:43.524 --> 32:45.114
My brother weren't so lucky.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.364
- Out there.
- No, but you were.

32:48.604 --> 32:51.474
- There you go.
- So you think it's all just luck...

32:51.524 --> 32:54.594
Luck. Fluke. Chance.

32:54.644 --> 32:57.274
Where you're born, who you're born to...

32:57.324 --> 32:59.714
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.

32:59.764 --> 33:02.804
Well, three out of four
ain't bad with my dad.

33:05.604 --> 33:08.764
No-one at home would believe
me but this is proper nice.

33:10.924 --> 33:14.434
- What?
- Afghan. I've never seen anywhere so beautiful.

33:14.484 --> 33:18.394
If you think this is nice, you're
going to shitting love Newport.

33:18.444 --> 33:21.234
If it weren't so, like,
bloody war and all that,

33:21.284 --> 33:24.554
then I'd live in a little
place in the mountains here.

33:24.604 --> 33:25.369
You'd need wi-fi, though.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.940
- Well, yeah, obviously.
- And Sky TV.

33:27.944 --> 33:30.604
And a Top Shop. And
Starbucks round the corner.

33:34.684 --> 33:37.234
Bashira weren't born
into much luck, was she?

33:37.284 --> 33:39.714
- A dad that beats the crap out of her and...
- Dawes.

33:39.764 --> 33:41.874
Shut the fuck up.

33:41.924 --> 33:43.804
Sorry, Sir.

33:48.204 --> 33:50.324
Sir, there's movement in the bunker.

33:51.324 --> 33:54.364
- How many, Kinders?
- Definitely a couple. Maybe more.

33:57.884 --> 34:00.524
Everybody stay low and out of sight.

34:01.684 --> 34:04.234
Sir, there's someone
heading into that store.

34:04.284 --> 34:06.754
Dangles, get me Zero on the radio now.

34:06.804 --> 34:10.554
Zero, this is Amber 3-0 Bravo,
sighting two possible insurgents.

34:10.603 --> 34:11.964
Wait out.

34:16.684 --> 34:18.484
Down! RPG!

34:20.563 --> 34:23.914
Zero, this is Amber 3-0
Bravo. Contact explosion.

34:26.324 --> 34:29.313
You all right? You all
right? You all right, Fingers?

34:29.364 --> 34:31.404
Rapid fire!

34:39.643 --> 34:41.034
Back down.

34:41.083 --> 34:42.444
Back in!

34:48.643 --> 34:50.724
Incoming from the compound now!

34:54.364 --> 34:56.324
Contact! Contact, wait out!

35:02.244 --> 35:04.354
Hold your fire!

35:04.404 --> 35:07.524
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

35:14.044 --> 35:16.354
What's happening, Sir?

35:16.404 --> 35:18.514
Keep your eyes on the bunker.

35:26.804 --> 35:29.074
CHEERING

35:29.124 --> 35:31.514
Did you see that?

35:31.564 --> 35:33.074
Beautiful.

35:33.124 --> 35:35.714
That has gotta be more
than a dead leg, that!

35:35.764 --> 35:38.804
- I would love to see them walk that off.
- Keep your heads down!

35:40.404 --> 35:44.474
Taj, take your guys down and check
both positions? We'll give support.

35:54.084 --> 35:56.154
They're all dead, Corporal.

35:56.204 --> 35:59.804
Dangleberries, confirm dead
insurgents aren't booby-trapped.

36:02.044 --> 36:03.724
Move.

36:08.644 --> 36:10.004
Clear.

36:14.124 --> 36:15.964
Clear.

36:22.564 --> 36:25.554
Clear.

36:25.604 --> 36:29.194
Store is clear, Captain.
Bravo 1 and 2 jackpot.

36:29.244 --> 36:32.164
Bravo 1 and 2 jackpot. Roger that, Kinders.

36:35.204 --> 36:36.874
Baz! Enemy casualty, Sir!

36:36.924 --> 36:38.234
Cover him.

36:38.284 --> 36:40.404
One times enemy casualty, Sir.

36:44.204 --> 36:46.154
Sorry, mate.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.564
Sorry about this.

36:48.604 --> 36:49.914
Clear.

36:49.964 --> 36:51.524
Dawes.

36:52.844 --> 36:56.354
Hold still, mate, we're
going to sort you out.

36:56.404 --> 36:59.634
Sir, I'm going to need my
morphine out my med bergan.

36:59.684 --> 37:01.234
You all right, mate?

37:01.284 --> 37:04.874
Just hold still for me. We're
going to sort you out, all right?

37:04.924 --> 37:09.204
Sir, we're going to have to medivac
him out of here, he's pissing blood.

37:11.004 --> 37:13.794
Zero, urgent medivac required,

37:13.844 --> 37:16.474
Bravo 3 to Alpha, Bravo 4 jackpot.

37:16.524 --> 37:17.883
Just keep making noises for me, that's it.

37:17.924 --> 37:21.374
- Two more jackpot over here, Sir.
- Nude-Nut, cover him.

37:24.324 --> 37:25.844
Clear!

37:32.414 --> 37:35.534
That's it, mate. Just stay with
me, all right? Stay with me.

37:38.694 --> 37:40.254
Clear.

37:41.734 --> 37:43.564
Bravo 5 and 6, jackpot.

37:52.654 --> 37:55.204
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.

37:55.254 --> 37:57.084
Qaseem!

37:59.094 --> 38:01.444
- What's that?
- Water. Water.

38:01.494 --> 38:05.044
Grab the water. Front
pocket. That's it, mate.

38:08.534 --> 38:11.374
You stay with me, mate.
Keep talking. Keep talking.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.404
Just tap it in his mouth. That's it.

38:37.374 --> 38:40.324
I can't believe Bashira's
father weren't one of the six.

38:40.374 --> 38:42.124
I really thought he was Taliban.

38:42.174 --> 38:44.404
Your work has been above and beyond, Dawes.

38:44.454 --> 38:47.164
- What the intel, or saving that bloke?
- Both.

38:47.214 --> 38:49.404
Just doing my job, Sir.

38:49.454 --> 38:52.404
Yeah, well, it takes a
fair amount to impress me.

38:52.454 --> 38:53.894
Thank you, Sir.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.724
They can go back to school now, yeah?

39:09.774 --> 39:11.884
Let's hope Bashira can, too.

39:11.934 --> 39:15.694
I do not want to get out my paddling
pool for the rest of this tour.

39:19.934 --> 39:22.134
Do not even look at her, Dawes.

39:36.974 --> 39:39.494
Eyes on Dickers's left.

39:47.214 --> 39:51.404
Oh... You could fry a pissing
egg on my head right now, man.

39:51.454 --> 39:54.254
Please can we try that when we get back?

39:55.774 --> 39:58.924
He's right, you should not get involved.

39:58.974 --> 40:01.364
But we are involved, aren't we?

40:01.414 --> 40:03.614
What are we, if we're not involved?

40:13.254 --> 40:15.414
- Debrief, Molls.
- I'm coming.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.134
Anyway, sorry.

40:23.614 --> 40:24.684
What?

40:24.734 --> 40:26.364
You were right.

40:26.414 --> 40:27.684
About the girl.

40:27.734 --> 40:29.004
I know I was.

40:29.054 --> 40:31.684
Yeah, well, I know too now.

40:31.734 --> 40:33.924
There was no way that she was Taliban.

40:33.974 --> 40:36.564
I was sure that we were going
to find her dad in them six.

40:36.614 --> 40:38.164
I'm sure he's rotten.

40:38.214 --> 40:43.334
Maybe he's just normal rotten,
instead of rotten rotten.

40:44.574 --> 40:47.364
Reckon you must be winning
James over now, though.

40:47.414 --> 40:49.084
Don't know about that, mate.

40:49.134 --> 40:50.764
He notices everything.

40:50.814 --> 40:52.444
And you've done good.

40:52.494 --> 40:53.884
Have I, though?

40:53.934 --> 40:55.604
I've compromised that girl.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.884
If anything happens to her, Smurf, then...

40:57.934 --> 41:00.494
It don't bear thinking about.

41:05.054 --> 41:07.294
Easy, you Newport numpty.

41:11.814 --> 41:15.494
Good work today. All of you.
You did your platoon proud.

41:16.574 --> 41:19.054
- Everyone happy?
- Sir!

41:20.694 --> 41:24.244
Private Dawes, high likelihood
of mention in dispatches.

41:24.294 --> 41:27.604
Heard from Bastion, and
without your excellent care

41:27.654 --> 41:30.684
the doctors say there's no way
the insurgent would have survived.

41:30.734 --> 41:32.124
Sir.

41:32.174 --> 41:34.294
Carry on.

41:36.174 --> 41:37.684
Right lads, relax.

41:37.834 --> 41:39.844
And may I just remind
you that tomorrow night,

41:39.894 --> 41:42.524
it's 2 Section's turn to
lay on the entertainment.

41:42.574 --> 41:44.484
- Aw... We still doing that?
- Yes!

41:44.534 --> 41:49.654
Now, I will be singing a duet
so I need one female volunteer.

41:50.774 --> 41:53.244
Dawes, lovely.

41:53.294 --> 41:56.444
And can I just say, that I will
be singing with such majesty

41:56.494 --> 41:58.364
that the Corps of Army Music will be

41:58.414 --> 42:00.604
practically begging me
to swell their ranks.

42:00.654 --> 42:03.454
- We know what song you'll be singing, Sir.
- What song?

42:04.894 --> 42:07.524
* Da-da-da-da-da... *

42:07.574 --> 42:09.814
What's going on?

42:36.934 --> 42:38.284
Cuppa tea?

42:38.334 --> 42:41.934
Shitting hell, Smurf. You
nearly give me a Julius seizure.

42:55.814 --> 42:57.644
This your secret cubbyhole?

42:57.694 --> 42:59.284
No, it's the roof of the shitter,

42:59.334 --> 43:01.964
but it's the only place
that I get peace and quiet

43:02.014 --> 43:05.374
from you lot asking for
after-sun and Pop-Tarts.

43:11.534 --> 43:13.924
- You all right?
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

43:13.974 --> 43:16.324
You don't need to bite my
head off for everything.

43:16.374 --> 43:19.364
- I'm trying to be nice.
- No, you're being a pain.

43:19.414 --> 43:21.814
I was trying to read my
little sister's letter.

43:29.054 --> 43:31.934
I've never seen a dead
body before today, have you?

43:35.374 --> 43:37.964
I had the opportunity when my brother died.

43:38.014 --> 43:42.294
My mum said, "Let's
remember him how he was."

43:45.454 --> 43:47.364
Maybe James is right.

43:47.414 --> 43:49.254
Maybe he was just unlucky.

43:51.014 --> 43:52.814
Like some of the kids out here.

43:54.054 --> 43:57.844
Guess they don't know what's going
on when their house gets bombed.

43:57.894 --> 44:00.174
Or when they're playing out and...

44:10.374 --> 44:12.134
Nice cup of tea.

44:17.334 --> 44:19.254
Sod off and leave me alone.

44:29.204 --> 44:31.634
Oh, and by the way,

44:31.684 --> 44:34.034
someone's spunked in the
ear piece in Sanga two

44:34.084 --> 44:37.194
so if you're in there and the
phone rings, don't pick up.

44:37.244 --> 44:39.994
Only a man would find that remotely funny.

44:40.044 --> 44:42.074
It was Micklar from 3 Section.

44:42.124 --> 44:45.044
Is that what they call
amusement in Leicester?

45:01.804 --> 45:03.604
Dawes!

45:06.484 --> 45:09.274
Just going to hit my
pit, Sir. I'm knackered.

45:09.324 --> 45:11.914
I'll be asleep before
the springs hit the floor.

45:11.964 --> 45:13.394
What does that mean?

45:13.444 --> 45:16.204
Don't know, but my grandad
used to say it every night.

45:17.964 --> 45:21.394
Lyrics. Learn them and
we'll do the tune tomorrow.

45:21.444 --> 45:25.154
Dangleberries is accompanying us
on the keyboard, so no pressure.

45:25.204 --> 45:26.524
Sir.

45:27.844 --> 45:29.844
Um... excuse me, Sir.

45:31.884 --> 45:33.524
I've been thinking...

45:34.644 --> 45:38.034
Oh, dear, that does sound dangerous, Dawes.

45:38.084 --> 45:42.044
Well, my teachers did say if I
had half a brain, I'd be dangerous.

45:44.604 --> 45:47.164
You've been thinking about Bashira.

45:48.484 --> 45:51.114
If you feel she's been
compromised in some way,

45:51.164 --> 45:53.234
then we have a moral
obligation to keep her safe.

45:53.235 --> 45:54.609
- Do we?
- Of course we do.

45:55.304 --> 45:56.754
What are we going to do?

45:56.804 --> 46:00.324
Well, you're going to bed
and learn those lyrics.

46:02.404 --> 46:04.674
Piss off, Dawesy.

46:04.724 --> 46:06.514
You just called me "Dawesy".

46:06.564 --> 46:11.044
I'm clearly winning you round with
my incredible charm and magnetism.

46:32.404 --> 46:34.524
Dawes. Dawes.

46:36.004 --> 46:38.524
- Ops tent now.
- Have I overslept?

46:59.684 --> 47:02.554
We'll have checkpoints at
either end of the street.

47:02.604 --> 47:06.594
- Now, the ASF will be coming in here...
- What's happened, Sir?

47:06.644 --> 47:10.074
Sorry to summon you from your
pit at such an ungodly, Dawes.

47:10.124 --> 47:12.114
We've had Bashira's
house under surveillance

47:12.164 --> 47:14.754
- since the contact in the mountains.
- Sir.

47:14.804 --> 47:18.114
Intercepted conversations mean
a plan is to be implemented ASAP.

47:18.164 --> 47:20.124
Has something happened to Bashira?

47:21.604 --> 47:23.554
We know that an action is imminent.

47:23.604 --> 47:26.994
Action? I thought we accounted
for all six insurgents?

47:27.044 --> 47:29.674
Bashira's father is clearly
in league with the insurgency.

47:29.724 --> 47:32.394
It would appear that he owed
certain taxes to the Taliban

47:32.444 --> 47:34.034
which he has been unable to pay.

47:34.084 --> 47:35.874
As the only soldier who has eyeballed him,

47:35.924 --> 47:37.914
your role in the operation is crucial.

47:37.964 --> 47:40.714
A man who has been driven to extremes.

47:40.764 --> 47:42.714
Thus, we need to extract Bashira.

47:42.764 --> 47:45.194
Well, do they know that
our intel came from her?

47:45.244 --> 47:46.714
That's why we're going in.

47:46.764 --> 47:49.394
These gentlemen here are,
to all intents and purposes,

47:49.444 --> 47:51.994
and for shorthand, Afghan social services.

47:56.924 --> 47:59.514
They are willing to help
facilitate the removal of Bashira

47:59.564 --> 48:02.154
from her family and into
a safe house in Kabul.

48:22.404 --> 48:24.394
You learnt your lady part, Dawesy?

48:24.444 --> 48:27.274
Do they know what song we're singing, Sir?

48:27.324 --> 48:29.994
He only sang it all the
way through training.

48:30.044 --> 48:33.474
Yeah. And he made me sing the
female bit once, didn't you, Sir?

48:33.524 --> 48:35.954
You know why, cos you don't
look like Prince Harry,

48:36.004 --> 48:38.234
you look like Sarah Ferguson!

48:38.284 --> 48:41.474
Never heard of her but I'm
guessing she's either from Mansfield

48:41.524 --> 48:43.284
or she's got a ginger head.

48:46.084 --> 48:49.434
- I can see the compound, Sir.
- Roger that, Kinders.

48:49.484 --> 48:52.314
Zero One Alpha to Taj. We
have eyes on the compound.

48:52.364 --> 48:55.394
- We'll secure the perimeter before you go in.
- 'Yes, Sir.'

48:55.444 --> 48:59.234
Special Forces will go in, apprehend
Badrai and get Bashira out and away.

48:59.284 --> 49:02.234
Not before we go in and
secure the area. Any questions?

49:02.284 --> 49:04.710
Sir, they won't just go in
firing, will they? It's just...

49:05.961 --> 49:06.711
Let's go.

49:15.844 --> 49:17.354
Prepare to move.

49:17.404 --> 49:18.604
Move!

49:41.844 --> 49:44.004
- Clear.
- Move.

49:58.804 --> 50:00.634
Set. Go, go, go!

50:07.364 --> 50:09.364
She ain't in there.

50:18.124 --> 50:20.034
She ain't here, Sir.

50:20.084 --> 50:22.794
- Where have they taken her?
- I don't know, Dawes.

50:22.844 --> 50:25.194
'I have eyes on the girl.'

50:25.244 --> 50:26.914
'Something's not right, Sir.'

50:26.964 --> 50:30.044
- 'The locals are anxious.'
- Go!

50:34.964 --> 50:36.674
Where?

50:36.724 --> 50:37.924
Where?

50:39.884 --> 50:41.924
Bashira, stay where you are. Stop!

50:44.484 --> 50:46.434
Bashira, stay where you are!

50:46.484 --> 50:49.114
Bashira, stay where you
are! Stop! Do not move!

50:49.164 --> 50:51.074
Do not move! Stay there!

50:51.124 --> 50:52.794
Lift your arms up!

50:52.844 --> 50:54.634
Lift your arms up!

51:01.004 --> 51:03.314
Kinders, I want all mobile signals blocked.

51:03.364 --> 51:05.194
All mobile signals blocked, Sir!

51:05.244 --> 51:07.674
We need bomb disposal here now!

51:07.724 --> 51:09.314
They need five minutes, Sir.

51:09.364 --> 51:11.194
We don't have that long.

51:11.244 --> 51:14.994
Dawes, what are you doing? Get down now!

51:15.044 --> 51:16.554
What are you doing?

51:18.644 --> 51:21.514
Please, Sir, you're going to
scare her. Just let me do it.

51:21.564 --> 51:23.114
I need to keep her calm, Sir.

51:23.164 --> 51:25.394
Kinders, is the ECM blocking all signals?

51:25.444 --> 51:28.434
It is, Sir, but she still needs
to keep still. It could still blow.

51:28.484 --> 51:31.714
Do not touch the device,
Dawes! Wait for bomb disposal.

51:31.764 --> 51:33.244
Hello, you.

51:34.684 --> 51:37.194
It's all right. I'm here now.

51:37.244 --> 51:39.474
Everything's going to be all right.

51:39.524 --> 51:40.954
I just need you to stay calm

51:41.004 --> 51:43.634
and stay really, really still for me, OK?

51:43.684 --> 51:47.284
We're going to get that vest off,
and everything will be all right.

51:48.324 --> 51:51.564
You're the bravest, bravest girl ever.

51:53.444 --> 51:55.564
Your dad can't beat you.

51:56.964 --> 51:58.234
You stood up to him.

51:58.284 --> 52:00.394
You showed him, you showed all of us,

52:00.444 --> 52:02.644
what a brave, brave girl you are.

52:04.684 --> 52:07.434
Everything will be all right.

52:07.484 --> 52:10.154
- Qaseem, have you tracked them yet?
- 400 metres, Sir.

52:10.204 --> 52:12.034
Northwest.

52:12.084 --> 52:13.434
What can you hear?

52:13.484 --> 52:15.834
They are trying to detonate the bomb.

52:15.884 --> 52:17.714
They are trying to detonate, Sir.

52:17.764 --> 52:20.194
We're going to play Sang Chill Bazi.

52:20.244 --> 52:22.914
Me and you, we're going
to play Sang Chill Bazi,

52:22.964 --> 52:24.844
and I'm going to beat you.

52:26.284 --> 52:28.284
We're soul sisters.

52:29.964 --> 52:31.714
- Sisters?
- Yeah.

52:31.764 --> 52:34.204
Soul sisters for ever.

52:57.924 --> 53:01.354
A... am I going to die?

53:01.404 --> 53:03.074
No.

53:03.124 --> 53:05.204
No, you're not going to die.

53:06.564 --> 53:10.164
Dawes, I need you to step away now.

53:11.804 --> 53:14.794
He's going to remove the
vest over her shoulders.

53:14.844 --> 53:17.554
She needs to stay calm and still.

53:17.604 --> 53:20.484
Dawes, step away now, understand?

53:24.084 --> 53:26.564
Just stay still, Bashira, stay still.

53:51.124 --> 53:52.554
Dawes, get back!

53:52.604 --> 53:54.514
Move! Dawes, move!

53:54.564 --> 53:55.964
Move!

53:57.004 --> 53:58.514
Move!

53:58.564 --> 54:01.594
Kinders, I need to send a
ten-liner. Turn off the ECM.

54:01.644 --> 54:04.484
ECM's off so we can establish
comms. Dangles, tell...

54:58.844 --> 55:00.474
Is that any better?

55:00.524 --> 55:01.714
A bit.

55:01.844 --> 55:04.714
Well, it's a bit of a
waste of an eye drop, Sir,

55:04.764 --> 55:06.994
but seeing as it's you.

55:07.044 --> 55:09.724
Crack on, Dawes, or
you'll be up on a charge.

55:13.444 --> 55:15.554
Where have they taken her, Sir?

55:15.604 --> 55:17.154
I don't know.

55:17.204 --> 55:19.194
I don't care.

55:19.244 --> 55:21.594
That's a bit heartless, Sir.

55:21.644 --> 55:23.834
It's not heartless. I just..

55:23.884 --> 55:26.404
I don't get emotionally involved.

55:28.884 --> 55:31.554
Anyway, I make you right about luck.

55:31.604 --> 55:34.434
A millimetre to the left
and you'd have lost an eye.

55:34.484 --> 55:35.914
That's fate, Dawes.

55:35.964 --> 55:38.474
Just like getting that vest off in time.

55:38.524 --> 55:42.034
Things could've all been so
different, couldn't they, Sir?

55:42.084 --> 55:46.914
If that vest would have blown, then
Bashira would have been red-misted.

55:46.964 --> 55:48.804
And so would you.

55:50.244 --> 55:52.364
I would never have forgiven myself.

55:55.324 --> 55:57.154
Lady Luck was smiling on us.

55:57.204 --> 55:58.674
This time.

55:58.724 --> 56:00.604
Indeed.

56:06.044 --> 56:09.514
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the stage Miss Molly Dawes.

56:13.204 --> 56:15.834
And on the keys, Mr Dangleberries!

56:15.884 --> 56:19.204
Don't Go Breaking My Heart by
Elton John and Bernie Taupin

56:20.804 --> 56:22.754
* Don't go breaking my heart... *

56:24.444 --> 56:27.234
*... I couldn't if I tried *

56:27.284 --> 56:31.914
* Oh, honey, if I get restless *

56:31.964 --> 56:34.284
* Baby, you're not that kind *

56:37.564 --> 56:40.204
* Don't go breaking my heart *

56:41.484 --> 56:44.124
* You take the weight off of me *

56:45.684 --> 56:49.434
* Oh, when you knock on my door, baby *

56:49.484 --> 56:51.834
* I gave you my keys... *

56:51.884 --> 56:54.034
You know what's coming, boys!

56:54.084 --> 56:56.434
*... Ooh, ooh *

56:56.484 --> 57:01.074
* Nobody knows it, nobody knows... *

57:35.164 --> 57:39.194
We are going on our bloody
holidays, so would you lot kindly...

57:40.884 --> 57:43.804
- Come back to me.
- I will.

57:46.604 --> 57:51.074
- I just want everything to be the same, Mum.
- Well, you're not.

57:51.124 --> 57:53.714
- Fate's thrown us together.
- Captain James?

57:53.764 --> 57:55.674
Me and you.

57:55.724 --> 57:59.634
You haven't said anything happened,
other than what actually happened?

57:59.684 --> 58:02.714
- I haven't said anything.
- So, this is the end, yeah?
