02:02.107 --> 02:04.591
David, I just finished

02:04.593 --> 02:07.760
You are a crime novel artiste.

02:14.603 --> 02:17.820
The new book is absolutely
fantabulous, my friend.

02:17.822 --> 02:20.106
It's compelling, captivating...

02:20.108 --> 02:21.274
But...

02:21.276 --> 02:24.277
It's incomplete.
Where is the dedication page?

02:24.279 --> 02:25.995
I didn't think you'd notice.

02:25.997 --> 02:27.247
I'm paid to notice.

02:27.249 --> 02:28.564
Well, I haven't decided.

02:28.566 --> 02:29.782
Well, hurry, would you?

02:29.784 --> 02:31.668
We're ready to go to print.

02:31.670 --> 02:33.786
Uh... I'll get right on it.

02:33.788 --> 02:34.787
Today.

02:34.789 --> 02:36.122
By the end of the week,
Amanda.

02:36.124 --> 02:37.790
I've still got my day job.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.175
Ah, yes.

02:39.177 --> 02:41.427
Lives to save,
adventures to live.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.512
I get it!

02:42.514 --> 02:44.881
You really don't.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.635
Someone is heating things up
in Santa Monica

02:48.637 --> 02:51.588
and they are not sharing
the sunblock.

02:51.590 --> 02:54.524
3 charred bodies have shown up
at the pier in the last week.

02:54.526 --> 02:55.975
M.E. cannot identify
the victims.

02:55.977 --> 02:58.611
She can tell us
that two are male

02:58.613 --> 03:00.196
and the latest victim
is a female.

03:00.198 --> 03:01.648
Well, if he's crossing
gender lines,

03:01.650 --> 03:03.599
we can probably rule out
sexual assault.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.119
Was the coroner able to determine
the exact cause of death?

03:06.121 --> 03:07.787
No. The results
were inconclusive,

03:07.789 --> 03:10.206
but my money
is on the obvious.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.607
It might not be that simple.

03:11.609 --> 03:13.826
If the unsub's connected
to the victims,

03:13.828 --> 03:16.546
burning the bodies might be
an attempt to mask their identity.

03:16.548 --> 03:19.115
Or he's sophisticated enough
to know the fire will eliminate

03:19.117 --> 03:20.800
the evidence
of his murder rituals.

03:20.802 --> 03:22.752
This takes time.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.804
If he's burning his victims
while they're alive,

03:24.806 --> 03:26.956
it's not just sadistic.
He's patient.

03:26.958 --> 03:29.458
And organized. He'd need
access to materials

03:29.460 --> 03:30.960
necessary for burning
a human body

03:30.962 --> 03:32.628
and a space to do so
undetected.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.147
Has anyone
been reported missing?

03:34.149 --> 03:35.431
Nobody that's a match.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.400
I'm running dental records
in there right now, though.

03:37.402 --> 03:40.186
Then the problem is we're
not even sure the victims are local.

03:40.188 --> 03:41.904
That pier is a popular
photo op.

03:41.906 --> 03:43.273
He could be hunting tourists.

03:43.275 --> 03:45.308
Or warning them away.
He's dropping the bodies

03:45.310 --> 03:47.527
where they can be found
quickly.

03:47.529 --> 03:48.661
He's also accelerating
his attacks.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.380
He's gone from a 4-day
cooling off period

03:50.382 --> 03:52.248
to only two days
between kills.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.616
It's all part of his plan.

03:53.618 --> 03:56.299
We need to stop him
before he makes it one.

to be noticed,

or because he lacks

He shows no signs of remorse

the pier is very
important to him.

Forget flossing those

I have been able to identify
the latest victim

05:08.280 --> 05:10.614
of this person barbecuer
as Lindsay Leeman,

05:10.616 --> 05:13.566
from Edina, Minnesota.
She was only 19 years of age.

05:13.568 --> 05:15.085
Her file's on your tablets.

05:15.087 --> 05:18.788
It says here she's only been
in Santa Monica a couple months.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.273
Yeah, it doesn't look like
she had a job,

05:20.275 --> 05:21.591
'cause according
to bank records,

05:21.593 --> 05:23.460
her mom's been sending her
$250 a month.

05:23.462 --> 05:25.912
Ok, so how does she afford
an Ocean Avenue address

05:25.914 --> 05:27.297
on such little income?

05:27.299 --> 05:29.182
Was she making money
under the table?

05:29.184 --> 05:30.617
Not that she was
depositing, anyway.

05:30.619 --> 05:32.519
Cell phone records
show her texting

05:32.521 --> 05:34.437
up until 7:00 last night.

05:34.439 --> 05:35.922
This unsub's
incredibly efficient.

05:35.924 --> 05:38.257
He was able to abduct, murder,
and dispose of Lindsay's body

05:38.259 --> 05:39.559
in under 12 hours.

05:39.561 --> 05:41.194
Wait, there's something else.

05:41.196 --> 05:43.813
All her communications
are to Minnesota numbers.

05:43.815 --> 05:45.282
There's not one
from California.

05:45.284 --> 05:47.584
So she lived somewhere two months
and didn't make any friends?

05:47.586 --> 05:49.602
I thought that only
happened to me.

05:49.604 --> 05:51.488
Garcia, any luck identifying
the other victims?

05:51.490 --> 05:53.657
No. Apparently fire's
my Kryptonite.

05:53.659 --> 05:55.041
But I'll keep searching.

05:59.013 --> 06:01.548
So what's he trying to say?

06:01.550 --> 06:03.717
Get out or this
could be you?

06:03.719 --> 06:05.251
Maybe.

06:05.253 --> 06:08.171
It's a pretty public area.
He's gotta be dumping late at night.

06:08.173 --> 06:09.990
Well, he blends in
when he does.

06:09.992 --> 06:12.509
Santa Monica police increased
patrol after the second body,

06:12.511 --> 06:15.562
yet he still manages
to dump Lindsay here.

06:15.564 --> 06:19.132
This guy's getting smarter
or he's got insider knowledge.

06:19.134 --> 06:20.767
We should take a look
at first responders.

06:20.769 --> 06:23.737
You know, his rage might not
be directed at tourists.

06:23.739 --> 06:26.523
If the bodies are found and
removed prior to morning rush hour,

06:26.525 --> 06:28.706
then most of them might
not even have a chance

06:28.731 --> 06:30.411
to see his work.

06:30.412 --> 06:32.412
Then who would?

06:36.985 --> 06:37.984
Hotchner.

06:37.986 --> 06:39.452
Sir, I noticed something odd.

06:39.454 --> 06:41.671
There aren't any utilities
listed in Lindsay Leeman's name,

06:41.673 --> 06:44.541
so I ran the address, and it turns out
it is not a residence,

06:44.543 --> 06:46.109
it's a private mail center.

06:46.111 --> 06:47.444
Did her family know
where she was staying?

06:47.446 --> 06:49.462
No, the apartment number
Lindsay gave her family

06:49.464 --> 06:51.464
corresponds to the mailbox
at the center.

06:51.466 --> 06:53.600
Her mom had no idea
it wasn't a home.

06:53.602 --> 06:56.019
All right, her mother's on the way
to Los Angeles to claim the body.

06:56.021 --> 06:58.221
Yeah, she just got to LAX.
I rerouted her to you.

06:58.223 --> 06:59.839
Ok. Thanks.

07:05.863 --> 07:07.981
There isn't much left.

07:07.983 --> 07:09.399
Were you able
to determine

07:09.401 --> 07:11.034
if the victims died
of immolation?

07:11.036 --> 07:13.044
An examination of the lungs
indicates Lindsay didn't

07:13.069 --> 07:14.291
breathe in smoke.

07:15.123 --> 07:17.073
So she was dead before
being set on fire.

07:17.075 --> 07:18.625
Same as the others.

07:18.627 --> 07:20.043
So how is he killing them?

07:20.045 --> 07:22.212
I was able to isolate penetrating
lacerations to the abdomen.

07:22.214 --> 07:23.463
They were stabbed.

07:23.465 --> 07:26.532
They most likely died
of exsanguination as a result.

07:26.534 --> 07:29.219
So the burning is nothing more than
a forensic countermeasure.

07:29.221 --> 07:30.273
An effective one.

07:30.298 --> 07:31.555
Not only does it destroy
trace evidence,

07:31.556 --> 07:33.423
but it makes it difficult
to identify the bodies

07:33.425 --> 07:35.258
and determine
a common victimology.

07:35.260 --> 07:38.094
Hopefully Lindsay's mother
can fill in the gaps.

07:38.096 --> 07:41.097
Why did she lie about
where she was living?

07:41.099 --> 07:43.400
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

07:43.402 --> 07:45.268
Did Lindsay know anyone
in Los Angeles

07:45.270 --> 07:47.337
before she moved here?

07:47.339 --> 07:50.657
No, she was on her own.

07:50.659 --> 07:52.158
Alone.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.310
That's very brave.

07:54.312 --> 07:59.282
She was fearless.

07:59.284 --> 08:00.917
Her dad died
when she was young,

08:00.919 --> 08:02.952
so she learned to be
independent

08:02.954 --> 08:04.537
earlier than most.

08:04.539 --> 08:06.956
Why did she leave home?

08:07.958 --> 08:10.093
She was chasing her dream.

08:10.095 --> 08:13.596
So she was performing
locally?

08:13.598 --> 08:15.565
All the time.

08:15.567 --> 08:18.084
Anywhere
she could draw a crowd.

08:18.086 --> 08:20.386
Usually the pier.

08:20.388 --> 08:22.522
Did she mention meeting
someone new?

08:22.524 --> 08:24.724
Anyone who was
offering her work?

08:24.726 --> 08:27.444
I was sending her money
until she got settled.

08:27.446 --> 08:30.613
If she needed more...

08:32.950 --> 08:37.120
Where was my daughter
living, Agent Hotchner?

08:39.000 --> 08:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:50.784 --> 08:52.919
So Lindsay's mother took out
a second mortgage

08:52.921 --> 08:55.672
so she could send cash
to her here, but the problem is--

08:55.674 --> 08:58.892
Money doesn't go quite as far
in California as it does in Minnesota.

08:58.894 --> 09:00.393
Exactly. And Lindsay
must have known

09:00.395 --> 09:02.061
that her mother would
be worried about her,

09:02.063 --> 09:03.897
so she told her that
she found an apartment

09:03.899 --> 09:05.431
or order to relieve
the financial stress.

09:05.433 --> 09:06.900
You think she was living here?

09:06.902 --> 09:10.186
Well, they don't
charge any rent.

09:14.842 --> 09:17.277
Excuse me. We're looking
for Sarah Mapes.

09:17.279 --> 09:18.745
Who's asking?

09:18.747 --> 09:20.530
I'm Aaron Hotchner.
This is David Rossi.

09:20.532 --> 09:21.865
We're with the FBI.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.666
What do you need, Aaron?

09:23.668 --> 09:25.034
We're investigating
homicides

09:25.036 --> 09:26.836
that have taken place
in the area in the last week.

09:26.838 --> 09:30.290
They called the FBI in
over a couple of burnt bodies?

09:30.292 --> 09:31.925
What happened?

09:31.927 --> 09:34.994
One of them a doctor?

09:34.996 --> 09:38.181
One of them was
a 19-year-old girl.

09:38.183 --> 09:40.433
Lindsay.

09:40.435 --> 09:42.519
What can you tell us
about her?

09:42.521 --> 09:44.971
She comes here now and then.

09:44.973 --> 09:47.390
Always singing for everybody.

09:47.392 --> 09:51.311
Made me promise to vote for her
if she ever made it on TV.

09:53.147 --> 09:54.614
You telling me she's dead?

09:54.616 --> 09:56.282
I'm afraid so.

09:56.284 --> 09:58.234
That's a damn shame.

09:58.236 --> 09:59.619
I'll be right back.

09:59.621 --> 10:02.071
Always the young ones.

10:06.327 --> 10:09.028
Excuse me. Sir?

10:10.331 --> 10:12.916
Sergeant Scott?

10:35.856 --> 10:37.924
Lock it up, Marines!

10:37.926 --> 10:40.426
- You got a death wish, Marine?
- No, Sergeant!

10:40.428 --> 10:41.661
In that case, Private Rossi,

10:41.663 --> 10:42.929
you might want
to put your helmet on

10:42.931 --> 10:46.599
before the Viet Cong
decide to paint your face red.

10:46.601 --> 10:49.335
There's a war going on
here, marines.

10:49.337 --> 10:51.004
The sooner you start
acting like it,

10:51.006 --> 10:52.472
the sooner you start
making it to tomorrow.

10:52.474 --> 10:55.108
And you, what's
your name, Marine?

10:55.110 --> 10:56.576
Private First Class
Hernandez!

10:56.578 --> 10:59.612
Well, Private
First Class Hernandez,

10:59.614 --> 11:01.414
seems like you landed
in some sunny resort.

11:01.416 --> 11:03.249
That's the only
reason I can think

11:03.251 --> 11:05.151
why you wouldn't be wearing
your flak jacket!

11:05.153 --> 11:06.819
Sorry, Sergeant!

11:06.821 --> 11:08.187
Sorry don't cut it
out here, marines.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.789
Sorry get you dead.

11:09.791 --> 11:11.257
And if you're dead,

11:11.259 --> 11:12.492
I have to carry your ass
back here

11:12.494 --> 11:14.227
so we can mail y'all
to your mama

11:14.229 --> 11:15.361
in a big wooden box.

11:15.363 --> 11:16.729
Now, do you think
I want scoliosis?

11:16.731 --> 11:19.332
No, Sergeant!

11:19.334 --> 11:22.168
Eyes front, Marine.

11:22.170 --> 11:24.804
Sergeant.

11:28.042 --> 11:30.843
Take a good look, marines.

11:30.845 --> 11:33.313
This is what war is.

11:33.315 --> 11:37.417
You follow my orders,
you just make it out of here alive.

11:37.419 --> 11:39.352
There's no second
chances out here.

11:39.354 --> 11:41.421
We either win or we die.

11:41.423 --> 11:42.955
Understand?!

11:42.957 --> 11:43.956
Yes, Sergeant!

11:43.958 --> 11:45.224
Now fall out!

11:45.226 --> 11:48.294
Dave Rossi.

11:48.296 --> 11:50.296
It's been a while.

11:50.298 --> 11:52.982
Too long.

11:52.984 --> 11:55.401
How did you know
it was me?

11:55.403 --> 11:58.187
Recognized you
from your book cover.

11:58.189 --> 12:00.473
You read my books?

12:00.475 --> 12:03.242
I thumbed through
one or two.

12:03.244 --> 12:06.195
I didn't know
you were out here.

12:06.197 --> 12:11.034
Yeah, I figured I'd get me
some of those California girls.

12:11.036 --> 12:12.535
And did you?

12:12.537 --> 12:14.037
Once or twice.

12:14.039 --> 12:17.840
But after my last divorce,
I figured, uh,

12:17.842 --> 12:20.293
marriage just wasn't
my thing.

12:20.295 --> 12:22.879
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.598
It's good seeing you.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.301
I got to go.

12:28.303 --> 12:30.386
No, no. Let me give you
my card.

12:30.388 --> 12:33.056
I can't believe
I ran into you like this.

12:33.058 --> 12:37.360
Look, we gotta
get together. You could--

12:51.375 --> 12:53.459
Hey, man--
hey, whoa.

12:53.461 --> 12:54.660
Easy, buddy.

12:54.662 --> 12:56.796
Just want to see if
you'd like a portrait.

12:56.798 --> 12:58.498
Already got it started.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.216
See?

13:02.636 --> 13:04.837
It looks just like you.

13:06.474 --> 13:08.057
No.

13:30.426 --> 13:31.726
If Lindsay
was a transient,

13:31.764 --> 13:34.098
it makes sense that the
other victims could be, too.

13:34.100 --> 13:37.618
This area of Santa Monica
has a heavy homeless population.

13:40.121 --> 13:43.507
That explains why Garcia
had trouble matching dental records.

13:43.509 --> 13:45.626
Regular office visits
aren't a priority

13:45.628 --> 13:47.962
for people who live
on the streets.

13:47.964 --> 13:50.147
He's been shaven clean
and left exposed.

13:50.149 --> 13:52.516
This is a complete
change in M.O.

13:52.518 --> 13:54.635
Yeah, and look at his skin.

13:54.637 --> 13:56.753
It looks like chemical burns.

13:56.755 --> 13:58.088
It smells like bleach.

13:58.090 --> 14:00.107
That's an evolution,
but why?

14:00.109 --> 14:01.592
Was the fire drawing
too much attention,

14:01.594 --> 14:04.928
or does the chemical burn
fulfill another purpose?

14:04.930 --> 14:07.264
He's got ligature marks
on his wrists.

14:07.266 --> 14:09.600
He couldn't fight back
while the unsub burned him.

14:09.602 --> 14:11.101
Changed his dumping
ground, too.

14:11.103 --> 14:13.103
In sight of a homeless
shelter?

14:13.105 --> 14:15.372
If he wasn't clear before,
he certainly is now.

14:15.374 --> 14:16.874
His face and prints
are intact.

14:16.876 --> 14:19.660
We should be able to I.D.
him faster than the others.

14:19.662 --> 14:21.078
Maybe that's intentional.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.414
His name's Jeremy.

14:24.966 --> 14:27.251
Give me a second.

14:28.586 --> 14:30.220
Excuse me.

14:31.156 --> 14:33.223
Please.

14:40.198 --> 14:42.399
You recognize him?

14:42.401 --> 14:45.819
He worked the Boardwalk.

14:45.821 --> 14:47.938
He was a artist.

14:47.940 --> 14:50.240
You sure?

14:50.242 --> 14:51.659
Thank you.

14:51.661 --> 14:53.694
This helps.

15:03.872 --> 15:04.922
Look--

15:04.924 --> 15:06.373
You don't have to say it.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.342
It depends on what
I was gonna say.

15:08.344 --> 15:12.546
You were going to apologize for
walking away yesterday. Don't.

15:12.548 --> 15:15.599
Last time I saw you,
you were unconscious,

15:15.601 --> 15:18.302
on your way home
with a concussion

15:18.304 --> 15:20.971
and a shrapnel wound
in your arm.

15:20.973 --> 15:23.891
I've still got the scar.

15:23.893 --> 15:25.609
What happened?

15:28.146 --> 15:31.615
You remember Danny James,

15:31.617 --> 15:34.902
PFC from Iowa,
was 19 years old?

15:34.904 --> 15:37.738
You remember what they
did to him over there?

15:37.740 --> 15:40.741
He was captured
outside Hue, I think.

15:40.743 --> 15:43.577
They held him
for 3 nights.

15:43.579 --> 15:46.497
No eyes. No ears.

15:46.499 --> 15:48.582
No arms.

15:48.584 --> 15:50.751
But he was still alive.

15:50.753 --> 15:54.254
You remember why
they did that to him?

15:54.256 --> 15:57.091
Hell, you were the first
one to figure it out.

15:57.093 --> 16:00.594
Fear. They were trying
to scare us.

16:00.596 --> 16:04.014
Same thing's happening here.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.886
Now, these people
are here to help us.

16:09.888 --> 16:13.891
They got work to do,
so everybody listen up.

16:13.893 --> 16:17.411
The guy we're looking for
is hunting the homeless.

16:17.413 --> 16:19.580
He seems to be
most active at night.

16:19.582 --> 16:21.898
We believe that this
unknown subject, or unsub,

16:21.900 --> 16:24.284
is trying to make a social
or a political statement

16:24.286 --> 16:25.902
by targeting
the homeless community.

16:25.904 --> 16:28.172
He's evolved from obliterating
his victims with fire

16:28.174 --> 16:29.590
to wanting them
to be identified

16:29.592 --> 16:31.341
while still
depersonalizing them.

16:31.343 --> 16:33.544
Listen, this guy's
burning people with bleach.

16:33.546 --> 16:35.095
He's trying to scare you.

16:35.097 --> 16:37.548
And the shaving of
the heads is most likely

16:37.550 --> 16:40.117
another way he can
humiliate his victims.

16:40.119 --> 16:42.419
This unsub has a method
of transportation

16:42.421 --> 16:45.322
and the facilities to bleach
and burn his victims.

16:45.324 --> 16:47.941
He dumps the bodies prior
to the morning commute,

16:47.943 --> 16:49.476
so he could have
a day job.

16:49.478 --> 16:51.028
You need to be
hypervigilant

16:51.030 --> 16:52.529
and look after
one another.

16:52.531 --> 16:55.732
Sleep in groups
and in shifts.

16:55.734 --> 16:57.267
How will we know
it's him?

16:57.269 --> 16:58.435
You might not.

16:58.437 --> 17:00.270
This guy blends in.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.805
He's probably a local,

17:01.807 --> 17:04.540
someone who feels wronged
by members of your community.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.577
He does not draw
attention to himself,

17:06.579 --> 17:08.212
and he's meticulous
in his planning.

17:08.214 --> 17:10.414
The fact that he's now dumping
the bodies away from the pier

17:10.415 --> 17:12.883
means he's probably aware
of our investigation

17:12.885 --> 17:14.718
and that this is far
from over.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.588
We need to increase the police
presence on the street.

17:17.589 --> 17:20.790
This guy is smart.
We have to be smarter.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.595
Thanks for your help today.

17:24.597 --> 17:27.964
We couldn't have reached out
like this on our own.

17:27.967 --> 17:30.134
These people trust you.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.468
Your training paid off.

17:31.470 --> 17:32.803
Thanks to you.

17:32.805 --> 17:35.072
I did my job.

17:35.074 --> 17:37.274
No, you did
a lot more than that.

17:37.276 --> 17:39.943
I was a screw-up
and you knew it.

17:39.945 --> 17:44.915
Well, maybe at first,
but you showed potential.

17:47.318 --> 17:51.205
Fall back! Fall back!

17:51.207 --> 17:52.739
Fall back! Fall back now!

17:52.741 --> 17:54.541
Fall back, marines!
Fall back!

17:54.543 --> 17:56.860
That's an order!
Fall back!

17:56.862 --> 17:58.662
Fall back!

17:58.664 --> 18:01.431
Aah!
Uhh!

18:04.286 --> 18:05.519
Hernandez!

18:05.521 --> 18:07.354
Take cover, Rossi!
Pull back! That's an order!

18:09.524 --> 18:11.525
But what about Hernandez?

18:16.414 --> 18:17.648
Leave no man behind,
Sergeant!

18:17.650 --> 18:20.551
Pull back! That's an order!

18:20.553 --> 18:24.721
Rossi, you cover this position
and cover Hernandez!

18:24.723 --> 18:26.623
I don't know if I can,
Sergeant!

18:26.625 --> 18:29.126
You can and you will.

18:29.128 --> 18:31.461
Where are you going?! Wait!

18:31.463 --> 18:34.164
Sergeant! Sergeant!

19:16.391 --> 19:19.109
Look, we're staying
just a few blocks from here.

19:19.111 --> 19:20.961
Why don't you come back
with me?

19:20.963 --> 19:22.579
I can get you a room.

19:22.581 --> 19:24.915
This is my home, David.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.651
This is no way
for a war hero to live.

19:27.653 --> 19:31.555
You know how many veterans
are on the street?

19:31.557 --> 19:34.090
Too many.

19:34.092 --> 19:36.593
More every day.

19:36.595 --> 19:40.930
It's not glamorous,
but... it's me.

19:42.116 --> 19:44.568
No, it's not.

19:44.570 --> 19:48.739
You think after 40 years,
you know a damn thing about me?

19:48.741 --> 19:52.409
How long have you
lived like this?

19:52.411 --> 19:54.494
I worked construction
for a while,

19:54.496 --> 19:57.214
but no one wants
an old man on the job

19:57.216 --> 20:00.283
when they can get somebody
younger and cheaper.

20:00.285 --> 20:02.386
How long?

20:02.388 --> 20:04.721
A year.

20:05.673 --> 20:08.458
Maybe 5.

20:08.460 --> 20:12.062
It's hard to keep track
without a watch.

20:12.064 --> 20:14.514
Then let me help you.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.803
If I had wanted your help,

20:19.805 --> 20:23.440
I would have asked for it.

20:38.923 --> 20:41.361
Could the fire have
destroyed evidence of bleach

20:41.386 --> 20:42.794
on the previous victims?

20:42.795 --> 20:45.212
Chemical residue would have
turned up in the autopsies.

20:45.214 --> 20:48.515
So we were right. He changed M.O.
to perfect his message.

20:48.517 --> 20:50.350
He changed something
else, too.

20:50.352 --> 20:52.302
I found bleach
in Jeremy's lungs.

20:52.304 --> 20:54.304
The unsub drowned him.

20:54.306 --> 20:58.174
The first victims
were incinerated postmortem.

20:58.176 --> 21:00.444
Why torture now?

21:00.446 --> 21:02.779
He's starting to enjoy
the kills.

21:02.781 --> 21:04.865
So as he fine-tunes
his methodology,

21:04.867 --> 21:07.484
he's also fine-tuning
what gets him off.

21:07.486 --> 21:10.287
Well, he managed to bleach
Jeremy inside and out.

21:10.289 --> 21:12.789
This could be about cleanliness.

21:12.791 --> 21:14.408
Or cleansing.

21:14.410 --> 21:16.243
The socioeconomic kind.

21:16.245 --> 21:18.962
He's trying to eradicate
the homeless.

21:35.880 --> 21:36.980
Need a blanket?

21:36.982 --> 21:38.765
Thanks, I've got one
that's all right.

21:38.767 --> 21:41.485
If you want to, check with some of
the younger kids first.

21:41.487 --> 21:43.687
Already taken care of.
Why don't you come with me?

21:43.689 --> 21:45.722
I can give you a shower
and a warm bed.

21:45.724 --> 21:48.057
I'm not a prostitute.

21:48.059 --> 21:49.659
I didn't say you were.

21:49.661 --> 21:53.363
I just thought I could
help you with your problem.

21:53.365 --> 21:55.031
And what is my problem?

21:55.033 --> 21:56.032
Your disease.

21:56.034 --> 21:57.117
Don't have a disease.

21:57.119 --> 21:58.452
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

21:58.454 --> 22:00.504
I'm going to rid you of it
once and for all.

22:00.506 --> 22:02.205
Leave her alone!

22:24.479 --> 22:27.731
No! Let me go! Help!

22:55.725 --> 22:57.392
Did you find her?

22:57.394 --> 22:59.427
Not yet.

22:59.429 --> 23:02.097
I had that son of a bitch
right in my hands,

23:02.099 --> 23:03.515
I let him get away!

23:03.517 --> 23:06.902
A few less drinks
might have helped.

23:06.904 --> 23:10.689
What the hell
are you talking about?

23:10.691 --> 23:14.442
I think saying age put you
on the streets is a copout.

23:15.912 --> 23:18.830
Don't you lecture me,
Rossi.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.949
What did booze cost you first?

23:20.951 --> 23:24.169
Your home? Your job?
Or maybe one of your wives.

23:24.171 --> 23:25.987
This wasn't my fault!

23:25.989 --> 23:27.856
I'm not saying that it was.

23:27.858 --> 23:30.458
I tried to save Sarah!
I couldn't!

23:30.460 --> 23:32.160
So now you're giving up.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.379
There's nothing else
I can do.

23:34.381 --> 23:36.497
Yes, there is.

23:36.499 --> 23:39.718
Help me to help her.

23:44.056 --> 23:47.842
Now, I want you to relax

23:47.844 --> 23:49.844
and focus.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.029
What's the point of this?

23:51.031 --> 23:52.230
I told you.

23:52.232 --> 23:54.449
It's a cognitive interview.

23:54.451 --> 23:56.701
Many times our subconscious
picks up on details

23:56.703 --> 23:58.853
our conscious mind's
not aware of.

23:58.855 --> 24:01.022
A marine more so.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.909
It's been a long time
since I was active, Dave.

24:03.911 --> 24:06.545
The instinct never goes away.

24:06.547 --> 24:08.046
Now, close your eyes.

24:08.048 --> 24:09.331
Oh, yes, sir.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.750
Take yourself back
to that night.

24:11.752 --> 24:13.534
Put yourself in the alley.

24:13.536 --> 24:14.869
It's dark.

24:14.871 --> 24:17.339
You're getting ready for bed.

24:17.341 --> 24:19.874
Something caught
your attention.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.026
What is it?

24:21.028 --> 24:22.543
And what is my problem?

24:22.545 --> 24:24.429
Sarah's voice.

24:24.431 --> 24:29.150
All right. But you must have
heard her voice a hundred times.

24:29.152 --> 24:31.403
What made it stick out?

24:31.405 --> 24:32.554
Don't have a disease.

24:32.556 --> 24:34.239
She's afraid.

24:34.241 --> 24:36.508
Can you see why?

24:38.394 --> 24:39.560
All right,
what else stuck out?

24:39.562 --> 24:41.863
Any distinctive odors?

24:47.569 --> 24:50.405
I'm not sure.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.894
It smells like a hospital.

24:55.896 --> 24:59.214
Whatever it is,
it's out of place.

24:59.216 --> 25:00.599
Focus on that smell.

25:00.601 --> 25:03.251
Let it draw you
into the conversation.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.469
...blanket?

25:04.471 --> 25:06.221
Thanks, I've got one
that's all right.

25:06.223 --> 25:08.473
If you want to, check with
some of the younger kids.

25:08.475 --> 25:09.474
I see him.

25:09.476 --> 25:10.809
Describe him to me.

25:10.811 --> 25:12.010
Why don't you come with me?

25:12.012 --> 25:13.695
I--I can't make him out.

25:13.697 --> 25:15.063
He's standing in the shadows.

25:15.065 --> 25:18.116
Blue collar? Clean-cut?

25:18.118 --> 25:20.819
Jeans and a button-down shirt.

25:20.821 --> 25:23.104
Can you see his face?

25:23.106 --> 25:24.372
It's too dark.

25:24.374 --> 25:26.541
Ok, let's go back
to the clothes.

25:26.543 --> 25:27.659
We follow them down

25:27.661 --> 25:30.445
to his hands.
Is he wearing a wedding ring?

25:30.447 --> 25:32.914
He's wearing gloves.

25:32.916 --> 25:35.450
Medical gloves?
Work gloves?

25:35.452 --> 25:37.168
Driving gloves.

25:37.170 --> 25:39.587
Are there any other
distinctive smells?

25:39.589 --> 25:42.140
Did he leave
his car running?

25:42.142 --> 25:44.392
Gasoline.

25:44.394 --> 25:47.195
Older model Ford.

25:47.197 --> 25:49.597
Yeah, the engine
is still running.

25:49.599 --> 25:51.566
It's a Mustang, I think.

25:51.568 --> 25:53.068
Can you see
the license plate?

25:53.070 --> 25:55.020
I'm lying on the ground.

25:55.022 --> 25:58.573
He's--he's taking her
to the car!

25:58.575 --> 26:00.608
He's coming right at me!

26:00.610 --> 26:02.977
The plate is right in front of you!
Tell me what it says.

26:02.979 --> 26:04.145
I can't see it.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.413
Yes, you can.
You can do this.

26:05.415 --> 26:07.449
- "J"!
- Yeah, go ahead.

26:07.451 --> 26:08.750
"W"!

26:08.752 --> 26:09.784
Go on! Go on!

26:09.786 --> 26:11.319
"D"!

26:11.321 --> 26:14.122
That's all I got.

26:15.458 --> 26:17.792
Rossi...

26:18.678 --> 26:20.845
You gotta find her.

26:20.847 --> 26:23.682
I can't lose another one.

26:23.684 --> 26:26.134
Another one?

26:28.804 --> 26:30.722
Try and get some rest.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.110
Factoring in a 2-mile
comfort zone

26:35.112 --> 26:37.529
mixed with Mustang
registries

26:37.531 --> 26:40.014
and a JWD partial,

26:40.016 --> 26:41.449
I come up with squat.

26:41.451 --> 26:43.952
He probably stole
the plates, Garcia.

26:43.954 --> 26:45.403
Run Mustang registries
from that area

26:45.405 --> 26:49.023
and focus on the ones
manufactured prior to the 1980s.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.626
Uh, I've got 10 possibilities.

26:51.628 --> 26:54.195
Well, I doubt this guy
could maintain a steady relationship.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.581
Eliminate any vehicles
registered to women.

26:59.001 --> 27:01.586
Only knocks off 2.
We got 8 more to go, folks.

27:01.588 --> 27:03.004
All right, what are
their occupations?

27:03.006 --> 27:04.305
Uh, ad exec,

27:04.307 --> 27:05.840
a teacher, a waiter...

27:05.842 --> 27:07.509
Whoa, I got a firefighter.

27:07.511 --> 27:10.261
Well, that would definitely
explain this guy's proficiency at burning.

27:10.263 --> 27:12.597
And he would know the layout of
the street cameras to avoid detection.

27:12.599 --> 27:14.096
Garcia, does this firefighter
have any relationship

27:14.121 --> 27:15.568
to the homeless community?

27:15.569 --> 27:16.985
Let's see...

27:23.559 --> 27:26.361
Chad Mills--third generation
firefighter.

27:26.363 --> 27:28.830
He saved 6 homeless people
from an electrical fire

27:28.832 --> 27:31.032
that destroyed the warehouse
they were squatting in.

27:31.034 --> 27:32.400
9 others died in the blaze.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.035
That's not a coincidence.

27:34.037 --> 27:36.020
Why didn't he come up in
the search of first responders.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.055
Because he isn't one
anymore.

27:37.057 --> 27:40.458
He left the department
two months ago.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.394
Just before
the murders started.

27:42.396 --> 27:44.512
Garcia--
sending you his address now.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.807
Unh! Unh!

28:56.585 --> 28:57.785
Clear!

28:57.787 --> 28:59.120
He was just here.

28:59.122 --> 29:00.355
I need medical.

29:00.357 --> 29:02.624
I'm going around back.

29:02.626 --> 29:04.325
He couldn't
have gotten far.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.677
Let's go.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.172
Try not to talk, Sarah.

29:18.174 --> 29:19.974
Help's on the way.

29:19.976 --> 29:23.695
This will coat your throat
and help dilute the bleach.

29:34.723 --> 29:35.690
Get in!

29:35.692 --> 29:37.158
What's the status on Mills?

29:37.160 --> 29:38.910
Mills is missing.
We don't have him.

29:38.912 --> 29:41.362
I repeat, Mills is gone.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.782
Uhh... Unh!

30:17.784 --> 30:19.233
You ruined everything.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.535
Come on.

30:35.348 --> 30:36.899
I should have
seen this coming.

30:36.901 --> 30:39.401
Rossi, you couldn't have known
he'd circle back for Scott.

30:39.923 --> 30:40.533
What you need?

30:40.534 --> 30:44.369
Garcia, give us everything
you have on Chad Mills.

30:54.095 --> 30:55.412
No dust.

30:55.414 --> 30:56.964
Nothing out of sorts.

30:56.966 --> 30:59.216
His clothes are organized
by color.

31:01.520 --> 31:05.639
You know, this speaks
to clear signs of OCD behavior.

31:05.641 --> 31:07.925
Sarah had some sort
of gel in her hair.

31:07.927 --> 31:10.394
I want to try to find
the source.

31:11.363 --> 31:12.646
What is it?

31:12.648 --> 31:14.865
Quell, a medical-grade
disinfectant.

31:14.867 --> 31:18.369
His OCD may manifest
in extreme germaphobia.

31:18.371 --> 31:20.538
That must be why
he shaved Jeremy's head.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.957
There wasn't any sign
of disinfectant until today, though.

31:22.959 --> 31:25.776
But it might have been eliminated
by the bleach and the fire.

31:25.778 --> 31:29.413
Guys, fire, bleach, quell--
these are all forms of sterilization.

31:29.415 --> 31:31.265
So you think the burning
might be incidental?

31:31.267 --> 31:33.250
If he's socioeconomically
cleansing the streets,

31:33.252 --> 31:34.656
he could be treating
the homeless population

31:34.681 --> 31:36.455
like an infection.

31:36.556 --> 31:37.972
To him they're a virus.

31:37.974 --> 31:40.123
And he's the cure.

31:40.125 --> 31:41.725
I figured out why Mills
left the fire department.

31:41.727 --> 31:43.777
He was forced out
because he contracted

31:43.779 --> 31:45.796
a drug-resistant
strain of tuberculosis.

31:45.798 --> 31:47.348
How did he get it,
you ask?

31:47.350 --> 31:48.895
Two of the squatters he saved

31:48.920 --> 31:50.635
from that burning warehouse
were infected.

31:50.636 --> 31:53.938
Theory is he caught it through
close, unprotected contact.

31:53.940 --> 31:55.272
That's a hell of a trigger.

31:55.274 --> 31:56.824
He blames the homeless
community for getting him sick.

31:56.826 --> 31:59.693
Combine that trauma with an
OCD germaphobe and what do you get?

31:59.695 --> 32:02.145
A serial killer who thinks
he can stop the spread of TB

32:02.147 --> 32:03.647
by killing
an entire population.

32:03.649 --> 32:05.649
The same way the victims
of the plague were burned.

32:05.651 --> 32:07.317
Well, now he's on the run
and he can't go back home,

32:07.319 --> 32:08.652
so where
would he take Scott?

32:08.654 --> 32:11.372
Back to where
his trauma originated.

32:11.374 --> 32:13.757
Garcia, give us the address
of the warehouse fire.

32:19.831 --> 32:22.332
Careful.
You gonna get me wet.

32:22.334 --> 32:24.184
I'm gonna burn you alive.

32:24.186 --> 32:26.503
That's a first for me.

32:26.505 --> 32:29.023
Don't go out of your way
on my account.

32:29.025 --> 32:30.858
You ruined my mission.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.343
Your mission?

32:33.345 --> 32:36.513
You fightin'
the wrong war, son.

32:36.515 --> 32:38.983
I am not your son!

32:38.985 --> 32:40.868
That the best you got?

32:44.857 --> 32:47.575
What's the matter?
You sick?

32:50.194 --> 32:52.496
You should recognize
the signs.

32:52.498 --> 32:54.415
It was your kind
who did this to me.

32:54.417 --> 32:56.417
My kind?

32:56.419 --> 32:57.868
Yeah.

33:00.505 --> 33:03.206
I was going to matter.

33:04.225 --> 33:06.343
You still can, Chad.

33:06.345 --> 33:09.212
Come any closer
and I burn him.

33:09.214 --> 33:11.315
You don't want
to do that.

33:11.317 --> 33:12.516
And you don't want to shoot.

33:12.518 --> 33:13.684
Otherwise we'll both go up.

33:13.686 --> 33:15.653
That's pretty brave
what you did,

33:15.655 --> 33:18.022
running into that fire
on your own.

33:18.024 --> 33:20.557
Yeah? Look how that turned out.

33:20.559 --> 33:23.393
I don't know, if you ask me,
I say it was pretty stupid.

33:23.395 --> 33:25.112
- Stupid?
- Yeah, that's right.

33:25.114 --> 33:26.997
You went in without
protective gear.

33:26.999 --> 33:28.782
Looks like maybe you were
trying to prove something.

33:28.784 --> 33:31.085
Third-generation fireman.
What's there to prove?

33:31.087 --> 33:32.069
It's in his genes.

33:32.071 --> 33:34.588
Quite a legacy
to try to live up to.

33:34.590 --> 33:36.757
But you just wanted to be
the best, didn't you.

33:36.759 --> 33:37.841
I am the best!

33:37.843 --> 33:39.510
Guess we'll never know
for sure.

33:39.512 --> 33:42.046
My whole life, I knew
I was gonna be a fireman.

33:42.048 --> 33:43.180
That I would matter!

33:43.182 --> 33:45.432
You do matter, Chad.
Everyone matters.

33:45.434 --> 33:47.134
Not him! He doesn't.

33:47.136 --> 33:48.686
That man is a marine.

33:48.688 --> 33:50.471
He risked his life
to protect us.

33:50.473 --> 33:51.939
You telling me
that doesn't matter?

33:51.941 --> 33:54.058
He's right, Dave.

33:54.060 --> 33:56.110
What?

33:56.112 --> 33:57.695
He drops that lighter,

33:57.697 --> 34:00.263
this whole place
goes up in flames.

34:00.265 --> 34:03.283
I don't want y'all caught
in the crossfire because of me.

34:03.285 --> 34:05.619
It's time to fall back.

34:05.621 --> 34:07.788
I'm not leaving you
behind.

34:07.790 --> 34:09.606
That's an order, Marine!

34:17.916 --> 34:20.784
Ok, we're falling back.

34:39.469 --> 34:41.938
What you gonna do now?

34:44.943 --> 34:47.911
Guess it's time
to finish this.

34:47.913 --> 34:51.281
You're not getting out
of this place alive.

34:51.283 --> 34:53.784
I didn't say I was.

34:53.786 --> 34:56.754
Do I get any last words?

34:56.755 --> 35:00.991
No one wants to hear them
'cause no one cares if you die.

35:00.993 --> 35:02.659
That's where you're wrong.

35:02.661 --> 35:05.796
What are you doing?
I'm gonna burn this place down!

35:13.104 --> 35:15.139
Don't do it!

35:37.912 --> 35:39.997
Thank you.

35:42.700 --> 35:46.637
So, that was quite
a stunt you pulled in there.

35:46.639 --> 35:49.506
I knew you'd get
the message.

35:49.508 --> 35:54.344
Figured that was my best chance
not to go down with him.

35:54.346 --> 35:57.481
So you bet your life
on the BAU.

35:57.483 --> 36:00.851
I bet my life on you.

36:00.853 --> 36:03.437
Do you know why
I joined the FBI?

36:03.439 --> 36:05.239
If you say--

36:05.241 --> 36:06.740
Because of you.

36:06.742 --> 36:10.277
You could say
the Corps changed me,

36:10.279 --> 36:11.862
or the war.

36:11.864 --> 36:15.949
But it was you
who made me honest.

36:15.951 --> 36:21.421
So, please,
be honest with me now.

36:21.423 --> 36:24.241
What are you running from?

36:28.046 --> 36:32.182
You remember how you got
that scar in the first place?

36:32.184 --> 36:33.617
Of course I do.

36:37.589 --> 36:39.439
Perez,
cover our right flank.

36:39.441 --> 36:41.592
Hernandez, our left.

36:41.594 --> 36:43.927
Mattheson,
I need you on point.

36:54.205 --> 36:55.739
Damn.

36:55.741 --> 36:57.991
Everyone, stand back!

37:00.411 --> 37:02.112
How bad, Sergeant?

37:02.114 --> 37:04.429
Hernandez, I need you
to take the troops back

37:04.454 --> 37:05.617
to our last position.

37:05.618 --> 37:06.917
Sergeant?

37:06.919 --> 37:09.469
Any movement
and this whole field lights up.

37:09.471 --> 37:11.138
Now move the men back.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.123
Yes, Sergeant.

37:13.125 --> 37:16.493
You better go, too, Sergeant.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.812
Can't do that, son.

37:18.814 --> 37:21.014
Leave no one behind.

37:21.016 --> 37:22.633
Don't die 'cause if screwed up.

37:22.635 --> 37:24.301
Who said anything
about dying?

37:24.303 --> 37:26.970
We're at the end
of the chain.

37:26.972 --> 37:28.672
We can use that ditch
for cover.

37:28.674 --> 37:30.340
We'll never make it.

37:30.342 --> 37:32.475
On my count.

37:32.477 --> 37:35.445
3...

37:35.447 --> 37:37.848
2...

37:39.701 --> 37:40.984
1!

37:44.923 --> 37:47.324
That blast
gave you a concussion.

37:47.326 --> 37:49.126
When you regained
consciousness,

37:49.128 --> 37:51.962
you were already
on your way home.

37:51.964 --> 37:54.932
Next thing I knew,
I was in the hospital

37:54.934 --> 37:57.768
getting ready
to rotate home.

37:57.770 --> 38:00.854
And I was receiving
a commendation

38:00.856 --> 38:04.174
for heroic bravery.
Huh.

38:04.176 --> 38:06.693
And you deserved it.

38:06.695 --> 38:10.197
Not a lot of people
would have done that.

38:10.199 --> 38:11.732
No.

38:11.734 --> 38:15.602
But someone did more.

38:15.604 --> 38:17.906
Hernandez, I need you
to take the troops back

38:17.931 --> 38:19.207
to our last position.

38:19.208 --> 38:20.624
Sergeant?

38:20.626 --> 38:23.493
Any movement
and this whole field lights up.

38:23.495 --> 38:25.829
Now move the men back.

38:25.831 --> 38:27.247
Yes, Sergeant.

38:33.004 --> 38:35.022
Hernandez, what are you doing?

38:35.024 --> 38:37.040
Push 'em through.
I got work to do.

38:39.711 --> 38:42.012
On my count.
We'll never make it.

38:42.014 --> 38:44.381
3...

38:44.383 --> 38:46.049
2...

38:49.821 --> 38:50.988
1!

38:55.226 --> 38:57.928
Aah!

39:00.548 --> 39:02.249
Hernandez?

39:03.901 --> 39:05.285
But why?

39:05.287 --> 39:07.537
Why did he do it?

39:07.539 --> 39:10.123
Or why did
I take credit?

39:10.125 --> 39:11.925
Both.

39:13.461 --> 39:16.263
The short answer is...

39:16.265 --> 39:18.765
I was ordered to.

39:18.767 --> 39:23.586
We were fighting that
P.R. war back home.

39:23.588 --> 39:26.723
The government
needed a face,

39:26.725 --> 39:29.776
a living face,
to parade around,

39:29.778 --> 39:34.147
to solicit support
for a unpopular war.

39:35.483 --> 39:37.951
I was chosen.

39:37.953 --> 39:40.287
And Hernandez?

39:40.289 --> 39:43.824
He was paying a debt.

39:45.243 --> 39:48.412
He was being a marine.

39:48.414 --> 39:52.799
He died
so that we could live.

39:55.303 --> 39:57.454
And you couldn't tell anyone.

40:04.979 --> 40:06.646
Come with me.

40:06.648 --> 40:08.598
Where?

40:08.600 --> 40:11.401
To honor our dead.

40:21.579 --> 40:24.748
"I am not concerned
that you have fallen.

40:24.750 --> 40:27.868
I am concerned
that you will rise."

40:27.870 --> 40:29.703
Abraham Lincoln.

40:32.173 --> 40:35.158
Your grandfather
was a hero, son.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.993
Thank you, sir.

40:36.995 --> 40:39.463
He saved both of our lives.

41:01.619 --> 41:05.572
You know, it's time you let yourself
off the hook, Sergeant.

41:05.574 --> 41:07.324
You did your duty.

41:07.326 --> 41:10.127
This country owes you
for your service.

41:10.129 --> 41:11.878
Oh, no. It doesn't
owe me anything.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.381
I had a feeling
you'd say that.

41:15.666 --> 41:18.368
But they're gonna
help you anyway.

41:18.370 --> 41:19.886
You know what this place is?

41:19.888 --> 41:22.806
It's called New Directions.

41:22.808 --> 41:24.836
It's an outreach center
dedicated to help vets

41:24.861 --> 41:26.861
land on their feet.

41:28.396 --> 41:30.514
Welcome home, Marine.

41:32.817 --> 41:35.068
Semper Fi.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.572
Hoo-rah.
