01:10.320 --> 01:11.905
The music we play is mournful...

01:12.698 --> 01:15.576
and tears flow,
itching our cheeks with sorrow.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.954
We do not forget
that our beloved Empress

01:19.037 --> 01:22.040
has departed this world
for one of eternal bliss.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.334
She's left us far too soon,

01:25.043 --> 01:27.963
but I take great comfort
that her soul resides in eternity,

01:28.046 --> 01:30.924
watched over by all the Gods
in the Elysian Fields.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.469
Now as we prepare to light the pyre

01:35.012 --> 01:37.055
that usher her into the afterlife,

01:37.472 --> 01:39.433
I ask only one thing of you.

01:40.392 --> 01:42.227
That you remember her as I do.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.105
A woman who loved Rome...

01:45.647 --> 01:46.732
and family...

01:47.649 --> 01:49.318
more than life itself.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.017
14 years after becoming
the Emperor of Rome,

02:22.476 --> 02:25.521
Marcus Aurelius
mourns the death of his wife,

02:26.271 --> 02:28.023
and the mother of his only son...

02:28.607 --> 02:30.192
Empress Faustina.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.640
Are they ready?

04:26.225 --> 04:27.643
They're just giving the horses some water.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.524
You should prepare to leave for Rome
at first light tomorrow.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.985
This is not a good time
for me to leave the front.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.904
I'll follow you in a week.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.448
Trust Pompeianus.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.201
And our attack plan is good.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.455
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.

04:53.502 --> 04:54.545
Father...

04:58.423 --> 05:00.509
When Mother sent me up here
to learn from you...

05:01.301 --> 05:03.011
I know I didn't take it seriously.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.267
Now, I feel I'm ready to.

05:08.892 --> 05:09.852
Feel?

05:10.686 --> 05:13.105
Know. I know I am.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.691
You don't know anything.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.946
I'm your son.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.657
Let me try.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.582
We'll see.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.601
The basic reason that Marcus Aurelius

05:50.684 --> 05:53.937
chose Commodus as his successor
is the obvious one,

05:54.021 --> 05:55.814
that Commodus was his son.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.943
And once that is taken into consideration,

06:00.027 --> 06:06.408
I think it would be extremely difficult
for Marcus to pass his son over.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.536
It would have looked
extremely problematic.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.157
The purpose of this training
is not to teach you how to kill.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.828
A great leader has internal strength.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.498
To get there, we begin with the sword.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.627
But, it's only the beginning.

07:00.963 --> 07:01.797
Begin.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.735
Again.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.030
Marcus Aurelius had been chosen

07:27.114 --> 07:30.117
at the age of 17 to, someday,
become Emperor.

07:31.410 --> 07:35.581
And at that point, after years
of education, and prepping, and grooming,

07:35.664 --> 07:37.207
he had been given military commands.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.959
He had been given experience.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.880
And he patterned Commodus's own
education in exactly that way.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.843
For Commodus to succeed him,

07:47.926 --> 07:49.761
and one day rule the Empire,

07:50.429 --> 07:52.598
Aurelius knows that first,

07:52.681 --> 07:55.392
his son must be groomed
for the throne.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.562
A process with a long tradition
in the Empire.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.652
Since the dawn of the Empire,

08:06.361 --> 08:08.363
the success of an emperor's rule...

08:09.615 --> 08:12.117
has relied on his control of the army.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.544
And to gain the respect
of the Roman troops,

08:23.295 --> 08:28.175
an emperor must prove himself
as a skilled warrior.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.802
Now, we may think
that it was a bit irresponsible

08:30.886 --> 08:34.515
of a father to take their son along
into a war zone.

08:38.184 --> 08:45.025
And yet, what Marcus Aurelius is trying
to do is introduce his son to his troops.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.945
He knows that when
Commodus inherits from him,

08:48.028 --> 08:50.739
that the troops
will be his power base.

08:54.743 --> 08:58.747
And he wants to make sure that the troops
are already familiar with him

08:58.830 --> 09:00.207
and comfortable with him.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.477
Greatly improved, Commodus.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.729
There's still a long way to go.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.109
In battle, your enemy will look you
in the eye and attack you with a weapon.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.904
In Rome,

09:31.947 --> 09:34.491
you must learn
to fight a battle of words...

09:36.410 --> 09:38.161
in a den of snakes.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.483
After proving himself
on the battlefield,

10:08.567 --> 10:11.236
Commodus heads back
to Rome with his father.

10:12.487 --> 10:16.617
But his training for the throne
is far from complete.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.176
Now, Marcus Aurelius knows...

10:35.302 --> 10:41.475
it's time for Commodus to learn to
navigate the Empire's political systems,

10:45.229 --> 10:47.064
including the Senate.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.028
For centuries,

10:53.612 --> 10:56.198
the Roman Senate
has commanded authority...

10:57.616 --> 11:00.994
as one of the Empire's
most powerful institutions.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.961
There was no way,

11:09.044 --> 11:12.047
no matter how much power
the Emperor claimed to exercise,

11:12.589 --> 11:17.052
for a single person to rule an empire
of 50 million people...

11:18.053 --> 11:19.304
without the help of others.

11:21.098 --> 11:24.560
The Emperor needs
civilian governing apparatus.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.980
And that apparatus,
that governmental structure,

11:28.063 --> 11:29.606
had to have leaders.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.192
The answer was the Senate.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.908
Made up of 600 men of the elite class,

11:41.243 --> 11:43.996
and with seats passed down
through generations...

11:47.666 --> 11:51.420
the Roman Senate is responsible
for maintaining the treasury,

11:51.503 --> 11:53.005
holding trials,

11:53.088 --> 11:54.965
and advising the Emperor.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.600
I humbly thank the Senate for its time.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.436
May the Gods be with you.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.902
Emperor...

12:14.985 --> 12:18.614
Senators. You know my son, Commodus.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.949
- Of course, of course.
- Senators.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.492
Emperor, before anything else,

12:23.118 --> 12:25.037
I would like to offer
my heartfelt condolences,

12:25.120 --> 12:26.413
on behalf of the Senate,

12:26.496 --> 12:27.873
on the loss of your wife.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.958
You're very kind, Senator.

12:31.043 --> 12:33.587
But you should remember
that it's not just my wife who was lost.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.005
My children have lost their mother.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.256
And Rome...

12:36.965 --> 12:38.717
-has lost their Empress.
-Indeed.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.594
And a great one.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.678
Without question.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.056
This is such a difficult time
for the Empire...

12:44.890 --> 12:46.183
in so many ways.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.521
Which is why I have not made
my request for funds lightly.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.898
I am acutely aware
of the limitations of the treasury--

12:52.981 --> 12:55.776
We are not interested
in awareness, Emperor.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.153
Simply, accountability.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.405
Emperor. What Senator Quintianus means--

13:00.489 --> 13:02.741
Senator Quintianus
made himself quite clear.

13:05.494 --> 13:09.206
But be assured, the Barbarian resistance
is in its last throes.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.999
And I have no doubt,
with the aid of the Senate,

13:11.083 --> 13:13.460
our inevitable victory
will come that much more quickly.

13:14.253 --> 13:17.422
A victory which will bring
greater compensation back to those...

13:18.799 --> 13:20.259
who made it possible.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.262
Senator...

13:29.893 --> 13:31.353
It's very interesting.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.236
You can't trust any of them.

13:47.578 --> 13:50.289
In the early centuries of Roman expansion,

13:50.372 --> 13:54.835
the Senate saw itself as the kind
of brain's trust of the state.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.255
The Emperors had to
pay lip service to them,

13:59.882 --> 14:02.301
but they were
always conscious of the fact

14:02.384 --> 14:06.847
that they could not allow Senators
to overreach themselves.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.310
And so, the relationship
between Emperors and Senators

14:11.393 --> 14:12.853
was often very challenging.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.692
As two of the most influential
Senators in Rome,

14:18.775 --> 14:23.655
Cassius Dio and Quintianus
both serve under Marcus Aurelius.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.536
And by supporting
the Emperor's request for military funds,

14:29.620 --> 14:32.372
they look to maintain
power of their own.

14:34.333 --> 14:39.338
Cassius Dio and Quintianus
were both powerful Roman politicians.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.839
They were both Senators.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.926
Cassius Dio was actually
to become a consul.

14:44.009 --> 14:48.639
Quintianus had led the successful
Roman campaign into Germania.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.059
So people looked to
them for leadership,

14:52.142 --> 14:54.478
for advice, for patronage.

14:55.145 --> 14:58.607
Both men were at the heart
of Roman politics.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.990
For Aurelius,

15:07.074 --> 15:11.995
negotiating with the Senate
is an important lesson for his son.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.959
But before he can
assume the throne,

15:17.042 --> 15:21.755
Commodus must have an empress
who will aid in his rule.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.426
When we're looking
at Rome's Emperors and their families,

15:26.510 --> 15:29.638
it's almost exclusively
arranged marriages.

15:32.266 --> 15:36.562
So these decisions were not made
very much on the basis of love.

15:36.645 --> 15:40.732
Almost all, really,
virtually all of the marriages

15:40.816 --> 15:43.819
one has seen for generations
amongst Rome's elite

15:43.902 --> 15:46.530
are for political, dynastic purposes.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.536
The high society
of the Roman Empire,

15:52.619 --> 15:54.371
was a highly aristocratic one.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.877
And it was therefore necessary,
when choosing a spouse,

16:00.836 --> 16:04.047
either for a prince or a princess
in the Imperial household

16:04.131 --> 16:07.426
to choose somebody
of considerable aristocratic prestige.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.485
Born into one of Rome's
most influential families,

16:27.905 --> 16:33.535
Bruttia Crispina is the daughter of
one of Marcus Aurelius's closest advisors,

16:34.745 --> 16:40.292
and is chosen by the Emperor
as a strategic match for his son.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.132
Bruttia Crispina
was from a very powerful family.

16:47.216 --> 16:49.259
Her father has been consul twice.

16:49.343 --> 16:54.598
A clever emperor needed the support of
the most powerful people in Roman society,

16:54.681 --> 16:57.142
who tended to be the
Senatorial class,

16:57.226 --> 17:00.562
and so he knows then
that when he himself dies,

17:00.646 --> 17:02.356
Commodus will be able to

17:02.439 --> 17:07.486
inherit a situation where
the movers and shakers in Roman politics

17:07.569 --> 17:08.904
are there to support him.

17:13.784 --> 17:17.329
My apologies.
I did not mean to be delayed, but...

17:18.247 --> 17:19.330
here we are.

17:21.165 --> 17:24.545
I must say, it's good to take a break
from all the matters of the Empire

17:24.627 --> 17:27.339
with this simple, private, social lunch.

17:29.007 --> 17:33.929
This gathering is as important as
any meeting I've taken in the Senate.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.432
Don't you think so, Commodus?

17:39.101 --> 17:40.060
I do.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.188
But I also think it's a beautiful day.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.650
I would love to show Crispina
some of the Palace orchids.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.082
Would you care for more wine?

18:02.165 --> 18:03.166
Perhaps a little.

18:17.181 --> 18:20.893
The marriage will bring
Commodus one step closer to the throne,

18:23.312 --> 18:26.607
securing his power and support
within the Empire.

18:32.821 --> 18:37.701
But the union is also a threat
to anyone looking to gain influence,

18:38.410 --> 18:41.580
including Commodus's sister, Lucilla.

18:44.958 --> 18:50.464
Lucilla had been
the perhaps most visible powerful woman

18:50.547 --> 18:52.299
in the Roman Empire at the time.

18:53.383 --> 18:57.012
And Crispina may have, in a way,
sort of usurped her position.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.689
Within months,

19:07.773 --> 19:09.942
Commodus and Crispina will be married...

19:10.859 --> 19:14.863
in a ceremony traditional
of royal weddings in the Roman Empire.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.205
When a member
of the royal family is married,

19:25.874 --> 19:29.127
an agreement is signed
between the two families.

19:32.297 --> 19:36.718
Gifts are exchanged and the union
is honored by the general public.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.516
For Commodus and Crispina,

19:43.267 --> 19:46.019
the wedding is commemorated
with minted coins...

19:47.938 --> 19:51.567
and a commissioned song
by one of Rome's best composers.

19:55.112 --> 19:58.073
But while the Empire
welcomes a new empress,

20:01.660 --> 20:04.538
not everyone in the palace
is celebrating.

20:14.173 --> 20:16.508
The marriage secures
a valuable alliance,

20:18.677 --> 20:21.805
but as the Empire's future
begins to settle in Rome...

20:26.977 --> 20:28.562
hundreds of miles away,

20:29.313 --> 20:32.941
with the absence of Marcus Aurelius
and Commodus on the battlefield,

20:33.817 --> 20:36.820
the war against
the Germanic tribes has escalated.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.704
The Roman army
is struggling to fight back.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.256
The Goths, this Germanic tribe,

20:56.340 --> 20:57.674
move westwards.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.052
And what this causes
is a kind of domino effect.

21:00.135 --> 21:04.640
And there is a whole series of wars
between groups of these German tribes

21:04.723 --> 21:05.849
and the Roman Empire.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.316
They're a diverse group of tribes.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.860
It's not like dealing with
the Persian Empire,

21:16.944 --> 21:19.905
where you're just dealing with
one government, one army.

21:20.405 --> 21:23.909
They form alliances,
they fall out with each other.

21:25.869 --> 21:29.665
And so the war proves to be
very long, costly.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.183
As the Emperor's wartime advisor,

21:48.851 --> 21:50.811
and a respected military leader,

21:51.937 --> 21:54.565
Pertinax has acted
in the Emperor's place.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.490
But with the Roman army
losing ground,

22:05.701 --> 22:09.079
he sends word of the mounting struggle
to Marcus Aurelius.

22:30.976 --> 22:35.731
News of invasions along the border
and Roman casualties travel to Rome.

22:39.193 --> 22:42.279
And Aurelius and Commodus
know they have no choice...

22:42.946 --> 22:45.365
but to head back to the front lines.

22:55.459 --> 22:58.170
In the reign of Marcus Aurelius,

22:58.253 --> 23:01.131
the military campaigns
were mainly reactive.

23:02.132 --> 23:05.677
These were not campaigns of conquest.
These were to solidify Rome's borders.

23:05.761 --> 23:08.514
And these were
forced upon Marcus Aurelius.

23:53.976 --> 23:58.939
Now facing a war with multiple fronts
against several battling armies,

23:59.773 --> 24:02.943
Marcus Aurelius
must come up with a plan.

24:03.652 --> 24:06.822
The third legion two leagues...

24:06.905 --> 24:09.074
west to the seventh legion,

24:10.242 --> 24:11.743
two leagues east, we'll trap them.

24:12.411 --> 24:13.829
-Right there.
-Yes, sir.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.414
Thank you, gentlemen.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.460
I'll give the Barbarians something.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.630
They don't give in easily.

24:25.174 --> 24:26.341
Can we defeat them?

24:28.093 --> 24:29.678
We'll find out on the battlefield.

24:30.929 --> 24:35.267
Or wherever these cowards decide to
crawl out from under their rocks.

24:37.269 --> 24:38.854
Is it true they have us surrounded?

24:40.189 --> 24:42.649
They do not have us surrounded.

24:42.733 --> 24:45.527
They do have us unsettled,
only because I wasn't here to lead a...

24:45.611 --> 24:48.280
a direct counter attack here.

24:52.826 --> 24:54.661
If we hadn't gone back to Rome,

24:56.163 --> 24:58.874
we wouldn't be
in this predicament.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.251
But we had to go back to Rome.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.425
We had to go back.

25:10.886 --> 25:14.056
Yes, yes we did.

25:14.765 --> 25:15.933
But if we hadn't--

25:16.016 --> 25:17.392
This isn't mother's fault.

25:18.894 --> 25:20.687
Don't put words in my mouth.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.356
What are you trying to say, then?

25:24.024 --> 25:24.983
I'm saying--

25:25.067 --> 25:27.486
She went to your tent
to ask for forgiveness.

25:27.569 --> 25:31.073
Your mother made a decision.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.991
Did you refuse?

25:34.284 --> 25:37.996
Do not lay the blame at my feet.

25:40.874 --> 25:42.376
Father? Father, Father...

25:43.043 --> 25:44.002
Father!

25:45.087 --> 25:45.921
Help!

25:48.882 --> 25:49.800
He just collapsed.

25:58.642 --> 25:59.852
For years,

25:59.935 --> 26:02.771
war has ravaged the borders
of the Roman Empire...

26:03.397 --> 26:05.399
and taken a toll on its Emperor.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.871
But nearly a decade
after the conflict began,

26:22.875 --> 26:25.752
Marcus Aurelius
is fighting another deadly enemy.

26:28.463 --> 26:34.011
One sweeping through the Empire and
wreaking havoc on the human population.

26:37.306 --> 26:38.390
The plague.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.525
For the past 15 years,

26:49.193 --> 26:52.988
the Antonine Plague
has devastated the Roman Empire.

26:57.701 --> 27:01.747
And the same half million miles of roads
built by the Romans...

27:02.331 --> 27:06.502
are now providing an ideal path
for the spread of the disease.

27:08.003 --> 27:12.841
One of Rome's greatest strengths
has become a fatal weakness.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.227
The Antonine Plague occurs

27:23.310 --> 27:26.021
in the mid '60s,
during the reign of Marcus Aurelius.

27:27.314 --> 27:29.316
The effects seems to have been dramatic.

27:30.359 --> 27:33.570
2,000 people a day
are dying in the city of Rome,

27:33.654 --> 27:38.033
and a quarter of all those
who are affected die of the symptoms.

27:44.665 --> 27:48.126
The Roman Empire
had good networks of communication.

27:48.836 --> 27:52.464
But that also meant that disease
could travel along those networks.

27:58.595 --> 28:00.848
It meant that any kind of new disease

28:00.931 --> 28:04.810
would quickly be dispersed
amongst the wider population.

28:14.403 --> 28:17.489
More than 5 million people
have died of the plague.

28:18.699 --> 28:21.201
And the Roman Army
has been nearly wiped out.

28:23.620 --> 28:24.830
With his father ill,

28:25.706 --> 28:29.543
Commodus knows
the fate of the Empire is at stake.

28:43.724 --> 28:44.600
Commodus...

28:47.060 --> 28:48.604
Bring me good news.

28:51.773 --> 28:55.319
There are reports of a tribal army
on the other side of the river.

28:56.987 --> 28:59.531
Pompeianus thinks we should
send the second legion across,

28:59.615 --> 29:01.325
hold the fourth and fifth in reserve.

29:02.034 --> 29:02.951
No.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.163
Tell him to commit all the troops.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.831
The Barbarians will have to...

29:08.707 --> 29:11.335
march a hundred miles
to attack our flank.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.754
We can overpower them...

29:15.172 --> 29:19.134
Pompeianus is always too conservative...

29:25.599 --> 29:26.642
Father...

29:28.852 --> 29:31.188
You're going to be
sole Emperor of Rome,

29:32.189 --> 29:33.232
when I die.

29:34.525 --> 29:36.026
You're not dying.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.695
I wish that were true...

29:39.988 --> 29:41.156
for your sake.

29:43.492 --> 29:44.660
I'm not ready.

29:46.203 --> 29:47.204
No.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.334
But if I don't name you Emperor,

29:53.752 --> 29:55.045
they'll kill you.

29:56.672 --> 30:00.717
You were brought up with women and slaves,
when you should have been here,

30:00.801 --> 30:02.135
by my side.

30:04.847 --> 30:06.056
I can be strong.

30:08.475 --> 30:10.060
Well, you'll have to be.

30:12.104 --> 30:14.690
Because even when
you've taken the throne,

30:15.983 --> 30:17.192
they'll come for you.

30:20.028 --> 30:20.946
Who?

30:22.447 --> 30:23.490
All of them.

30:30.038 --> 30:31.164
No, no, no.

30:31.248 --> 30:33.792
Not the generals,
they're loyal soldiers.

30:36.170 --> 30:39.798
Anyone who thinks
they deserve to be Emperor.

30:43.844 --> 30:44.928
Promise me...

30:47.472 --> 30:49.016
you'll finish the war.

31:17.252 --> 31:20.088
Nearly 20 years
after he claimed the throne,

31:23.258 --> 31:26.803
Marcus Aurelius
dies at the age of 58.

31:49.868 --> 31:52.996
The life of one of
the most celebrated rulers

31:53.080 --> 31:58.502
in the history of the Roman Empire
will be honored for centuries.

32:03.006 --> 32:08.053
And his writings on philosophy
will be read for generations.

32:08.887 --> 32:11.807
Marcus Aurelius was famous
for being a good Emperor.

32:11.890 --> 32:15.811
He saw it as his duty
to support the Empire,

32:15.894 --> 32:18.230
and to try and protect it militarily.

32:18.313 --> 32:20.566
But he was also popular with the people.

32:20.649 --> 32:22.943
He delivered Rome
great military victories,

32:23.026 --> 32:24.695
he handed out money,

32:24.778 --> 32:27.447
and people seemed to have
held him in very high regard.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.295
After the passing of one of
Rome's greatest Emperors,

32:43.338 --> 32:49.595
Commodus knows he must now take on
the most powerful position in the world.

32:59.897 --> 33:01.982
And while the Empire grieves,

33:03.275 --> 33:05.485
the royal family
looks to the future...

33:06.653 --> 33:10.157
knowing that the only son
of Marcus Aurelius...

33:10.240 --> 33:13.493
must now carry on
his father's legacy.

34:19.643 --> 34:22.688
That's four farms along the frontier
and two villages to the east.

34:22.771 --> 34:23.605
Cowards.

34:23.688 --> 34:26.650
And we'll continue to see more of this
unless we strike back now.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.944
And stretch the legion
out even thinner?

34:29.027 --> 34:31.612
We need to consolidate our forces.

34:32.114 --> 34:33.574
While the animals that did this

34:33.657 --> 34:35.868
scatter into the woods
to strike us again tomorrow.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.788
No. I say we push across the Danube.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.748
Drive a wedge
between the two tribes--

34:41.831 --> 34:44.877
You seem to forget
the numbers are on our side.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.505
To say nothing of the Gods,
this one battle may have been lost--

34:48.589 --> 34:50.591
I don't doubt we'll win the war--

34:50.674 --> 34:51.842
Enough!

34:55.344 --> 34:58.807
Consolidate, separate...

35:00.976 --> 35:02.853
Can you give me an answer
as to why are we even here?

35:02.936 --> 35:05.189
Emperor. We are here
for the glory of Rome.

35:06.023 --> 35:08.066
We are hundreds of miles from Rome.

35:08.859 --> 35:12.362
-Emperor, your father himself--
-I'm well aware of my father's feelings.

35:14.615 --> 35:15.657
Of course.

35:24.208 --> 35:25.792
For nearly a decade,

35:25.876 --> 35:29.129
Commodus has watched
his Empire consumed by war.

35:31.131 --> 35:32.299
And with his father gone,

35:33.467 --> 35:35.302
he knows he must make a choice

35:35.928 --> 35:38.847
that will determine the fate of Rome.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.519
When Marcus Aurelius dies,

35:43.602 --> 35:46.688
Commodus finds himself in a war zone

35:46.772 --> 35:48.982
with a war
that he doesn't want to continue.

35:54.530 --> 35:57.991
It's easy for us to judge Commodus
by the standards of his father.

35:58.575 --> 36:01.370
But Marcus Aurelius
was an exceptional emperor,

36:01.453 --> 36:05.332
who had ruled from the very highest
standards of good governance.

36:05.999 --> 36:08.877
Commodus was not
really interested in administration.

36:08.961 --> 36:11.880
And he was not interested
in fighting wars.

36:11.964 --> 36:15.217
And so, Commodus seems to sit
at this threshold

36:15.300 --> 36:17.594
of an empire that is transitioning.

36:39.616 --> 36:42.911
Commodus will soon lead
the entire Roman Empire.

36:43.912 --> 36:47.499
And those he trusts will be promoted
into the highest ranks

36:47.583 --> 36:49.793
of the Imperial palace.

36:51.336 --> 36:55.465
Including his closest friends
and former slaves...

36:55.883 --> 36:58.010
Cleander and Saoterus.

37:00.304 --> 37:02.472
Knock knock. Anyone home?

37:04.600 --> 37:05.642
Emperor?

37:07.936 --> 37:08.896
No.

37:09.813 --> 37:11.064
He's got to be at the bluff.

37:11.690 --> 37:13.025
Back to the bluff.

37:17.613 --> 37:20.699
Cleander and Saoterus
were members of the Imperial household

37:20.782 --> 37:23.535
and of slightly different background

37:23.619 --> 37:26.371
at the moment when we encounter them
in the life of Commodus.

37:26.455 --> 37:30.375
But both of them were, in essence,
low status individuals

37:30.459 --> 37:33.462
who achieved high status
by virtue of proximity to the Emperor.

37:34.296 --> 37:38.842
Commodus's trust of Cleander and Saoterus
probably derives from the fact

37:38.926 --> 37:41.637
that they were close to him
for virtually his entire life.

38:06.119 --> 38:07.246
Let them through.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.751
We thought you were
coming back to the tent.

38:13.585 --> 38:15.420
I don't want to be
anywhere near that tent.

38:15.504 --> 38:20.425
Or that camp. Or them.
Or this ridiculous, endless war.

38:20.509 --> 38:21.760
What did they say?

38:21.844 --> 38:23.262
It's what they didn't say.

38:24.471 --> 38:27.683
“Yes, Emperor.
“Excellent point, Emperor.

38:31.770 --> 38:32.938
They don't care what I think.

38:35.774 --> 38:38.110
You see,
I'm not my father, so I don't exist.

38:38.652 --> 38:40.737
They'll just keep doing
what they want to do and...

38:41.572 --> 38:42.906
and they'll never respect me.

38:42.990 --> 38:45.951
You're the Emperor of Rome.
They don't have to respect you.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.036
They have to obey you.

38:48.745 --> 38:49.913
If only it were that easy.

38:51.957 --> 38:53.959
It doesn't have to be so difficult.

38:55.252 --> 38:57.754
Commodus, the people of Rome,
they're just like you.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.048
They want to see an end to this war.

39:00.132 --> 39:02.217
I've heard it in the streets every day.

39:02.301 --> 39:04.845
It kept your father away for eight years.
And now, it's threatening

39:04.928 --> 39:07.264
-to do the same to you.
-I know. But I can't just--

39:07.347 --> 39:11.059
They need to see you.
A new Emperor needs to be in Rome.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.524
I promised my father
I would finish the war.

39:18.817 --> 39:20.235
Those generals, they know it.

39:20.319 --> 39:22.529
And they will use it against me
at every opportunity.

39:23.113 --> 39:24.573
So finish it.

39:44.885 --> 39:49.723
Despite his father's wishes
and the advice of his military advisors,

39:50.349 --> 39:55.646
Commodus is determined to put an end
to the war with the Germanic tribes.

39:57.898 --> 40:00.484
And just months
after his father's death,

40:02.194 --> 40:05.531
he makes his first move
in his absence.

40:23.632 --> 40:27.219
Emperor, with all due respect,
I urge you to reconsider--

40:45.279 --> 40:47.197
The war is over.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.045
The treaty marks
a historic moment for the Empire...

41:02.713 --> 41:05.340
as Germanic tribes
are pushed back from the border...

41:06.508 --> 41:11.847
and thousands of enemy soldiers
are forced to enlist in the Roman Army.

41:17.352 --> 41:21.398
But for Commodus,
the fight is far from over.

41:23.859 --> 41:26.403
While the people celebrate peace,

41:27.279 --> 41:30.490
the military and the Senate
oppose the treaty.

41:36.830 --> 41:40.375
Commodus did not continue to pursue

41:40.459 --> 41:44.004
his father's war with the Germanic tribes.

41:46.757 --> 41:52.346
When historians wrote about
Commodus suspending this war,

41:52.429 --> 41:56.099
they often said that he was eager
to rush back to Rome,

41:56.183 --> 41:59.394
because he wanted to
enjoy life in the city.

41:59.478 --> 42:03.065
That he had some interest
in luxury and debauchery

42:03.148 --> 42:05.359
that kept him off the battlefield.

42:05.442 --> 42:09.404
But instead, we can see someone
who really wanted to shore up

42:09.488 --> 42:13.992
political support for himself
in the nexus of power.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.580
With the war finally over,

42:19.122 --> 42:21.458
Commodus prepares to
leave the battlefront.

42:22.334 --> 42:27.339
And can now return home
as ruler of the Roman Empire.
