<i>[Woman On Radio]</i>
<i>Coroner Van 3, what's your E. T. A?</i>

00:04.037 --> 00:05.971
<i>[Radio Chatter]</i>

00:06.039 --> 00:08.701
<i>[Booth] They found the victim</i>
<i>in the filtration system.</i>

00:08.775 --> 00:11.744
<i>Just, you know, some bones,</i>
<i>and nobody knows what to make of them.</i>

00:11.811 --> 00:13.745
I mean, look at this.

00:13.813 --> 00:16.611
Millions of tax dollars
are spent to clean and treat tap water...

00:16.683 --> 00:19.413
and yet people spend billions
on bottled water.

00:19.486 --> 00:22.148
Well, it's cleaner.
Look, it comes from a clean mountain stream.

00:22.222 --> 00:25.089
Yeah, which contains
fecal matter from animals.

00:25.158 --> 00:28.719
There's no bones in it, though, is there?
Don't want that in your water.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.958
Excuse me. Um, do you know
how long this is gonna take?

00:32.031 --> 00:36.128
- Department wants to know
when I can get back on line.
- <i>[Man] Bag that and mark it.</i>

00:37.270 --> 00:39.636
Any way to determine
where the body originated?

00:39.706 --> 00:42.903
Water comes here through pipelines
that travel through five different states.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.342
<i>That's why I called the feds in.</i>

00:45.412 --> 00:48.279
Great. How many miles of pipe?

00:48.348 --> 00:50.339
About 1,800.

00:50.417 --> 00:53.250
I'm gonna need a schematic
of the entire system as soon as you can.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.913
- Sure.
- Yeah. Bones?

00:55.989 --> 01:00.358
Swirl treatment sped the rate of decomp.
Death was most likely less than three months ago.

01:01.961 --> 01:04.861
The sacrum is small, still developing.

01:04.931 --> 01:08.025
A kid.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.535
A little girl...

01:10.603 --> 01:13.094
about eight to 10 years old.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.271
[Chattering]

01:17.343 --> 01:19.868
[Booth]
Hey, any luck with the cause of death?

01:19.946 --> 01:22.813
[Zack] Eh, postmortem trauma
makes assignation of cause difficult.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.282
Great. "No" would've been just fine.

01:25.351 --> 01:30.311
There are bands of discoloration on the ribs.
Cam might find out why with a tox screen.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.689
I'd like those clothes as soon as I can get 'em.
Lots of crusty bugs and slime.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.719
All yours.
Zack, spend some time with the teeth.

01:37.797 --> 01:40.698
- They should be more discolored.
- Everything okay here?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.497
Yeah, sure. Hey. You know?

01:43.570 --> 01:46.038
- How's things?
- You know, murder and stuff.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.199
Just another day at the office.
How about you?

01:48.274 --> 01:50.242
Same old same old.

01:50.310 --> 01:54.337
<i>Listen, the Bureau's running location checks</i>
<i>for registered pedophiles in the area...</i>

01:54.414 --> 01:56.882
but we can't do much until we,
you know, I.D. the girl.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.010
<i>I'm running D.N.A. on the hairs</i>
<i>I pulled from the skull.</i>

02:00.086 --> 02:02.987
There's something funky about it.
The roots confirm brown hair.

02:03.056 --> 02:06.492
<i>The blonde is from oxidized thiols</i>
<i>evident in the hair shaft.</i>

02:06.559 --> 02:09.858
- Her hair was bleached?
- Wait, come on. I mean,
what nine-year-old dyes her hair?

02:09.929 --> 02:12.693
Well, that might explain why my sketch...

02:12.765 --> 02:15.427
isn't getting any hits from
the missing children's database.

02:15.502 --> 02:18.096
<i>Zack, look at the remains again</i>
<i>with a focus...</i>

02:18.171 --> 02:22.164
<i>on any physical anomalies that</i>
<i>could hamper identification.</i>

02:22.242 --> 02:24.733
- I've got results cooking, so...
- Sure. Yeah. See you later.

02:26.112 --> 02:29.081
- <i>Don't you have work to do?</i>
- Don't you?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.140
[Chuckles]

02:31.217 --> 02:33.412
Right. Right.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.884
<i>I should be able to run a tox screen</i>
<i>with the tissue left on her clavicle.</i>

02:39.959 --> 02:43.451
The scrapings that I took from the cheek
and eye socket contain propylene glycol...

02:43.530 --> 02:47.227
- fragrance, dyes and lanolin.
- She was wearing makeup?

02:47.300 --> 02:51.600
I was going to use dentition
to narrow down the age range, but look.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.375
<i>She has false teeth?</i>

02:57.443 --> 02:59.434
What the hell happened to this kid?

02:59.512 --> 03:03.278
- The false teeth replace
the missing deciduous teeth.
- Baby teeth.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.613
<i>And the other teeth were veneered.</i>

03:05.685 --> 03:09.553
What is she?
A midget stripper?

03:09.622 --> 03:12.785
[Angela] Okay, this is the color
she would've had from the bleaching.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.884
[Hodgins] I think the alkaloids
would make the color brighter.

03:14.961 --> 03:19.591
<i>Okay, so some twisted psycho killer gives</i>
<i>this little girl a makeover before he kills her?</i>

03:19.666 --> 03:23.796
I hate working with kids.
Childhood should be all about swings.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.431
- Swings?
- Yeah. You know, how high can I go?

03:27.507 --> 03:29.839
If I twist the chains,
how fast will I spin?

03:29.909 --> 03:32.309
What if I try to jump off
before the swing stops?

03:32.378 --> 03:34.642
- Exactly.
- <i>[Hodgins] I miss that feeling.</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:38.673
- Yeah. Me too.
- I miss organic chemistry class.

03:38.751 --> 03:41.515
- Those were good times.
- I miss my first microscope.

03:41.588 --> 03:44.284
Great. Yeah.
And I miss normal people. Can we go on?

03:44.357 --> 03:47.224
- Factor in the teeth.
- [Beeping]

03:47.293 --> 03:50.421
<i>Yeah, you know? Because, uh,</i>
<i>this isn't weird enough.</i>

03:50.496 --> 03:54.523
Hodgins supplied the types of makeup.

03:54.601 --> 03:57.331
<i>And that's what we've got.</i>

03:57.403 --> 04:01.339
- She looks 30.
- Okay, run the image against the database now.

04:03.009 --> 04:06.001
[Beeping]

04:08.014 --> 04:10.278
Oh, my God.
That's Brianna Swanson.

04:10.350 --> 04:13.285
- Who?
- The little beauty queen
who disappeared a few months ago.

04:13.353 --> 04:16.481
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>In the middle of the Little</i>
<i>Miss Junior Patriot Pageant.</i>

04:16.555 --> 04:19.047
Just nine years old.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.830
What do you mean...

05:03.903 --> 05:06.838
there isn't even
enough of her for me to see?

05:06.906 --> 05:08.897
The body traveled
through miles of piping.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.705
And then after three months...

05:14.280 --> 05:17.078
[Crying]
She was so beautiful, wasn't she?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.175
I always thought someday she'd come back.

05:19.252 --> 05:23.120
I even filled out her application
to theJunior Miss Starlite competition.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.783
She would've won her division.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.292
We're very sorry for your loss.

05:32.165 --> 05:37.933
<i>Ms. Swanson, I discovered dental work</i>
<i>on Brianna one doesn't usually see on a child.</i>

05:39.305 --> 05:42.206
The veneers and the caps? Yeah.
A lot of the girls had them.

05:42.275 --> 05:45.403
Statistically, that's... that's not true.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.641
<i>Well, Brianna took some antibiotics</i>
<i>when she was a baby that stained her teeth.</i>

05:48.715 --> 05:53.778
<i>She was very self-conscious about that,</i>
<i>so I wanted her to feel good about herself.</i>

05:53.853 --> 05:58.222
A nine-year-old is hardly mature enough
to make an informed decision about...

05:58.291 --> 06:01.886
You were at the competition in Delaware
when Brianna went missing, correct?

06:01.961 --> 06:04.555
Yeah. I never missed a pageant.
I never would.

06:04.630 --> 06:08.327
But you weren't... you weren't with her
when, uh, she disappeared?

06:08.401 --> 06:11.734
No. I left her alone
in our room for a minute.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.738
When I came back, she was gone.

06:17.777 --> 06:21.508
There's not a day that goes by
that I don't hate myself for that.

06:21.581 --> 06:25.574
According to initial reports, you suspected
your ex-husband of kidnapping Brianna?

06:25.651 --> 06:28.620
Well, he was trying to get custody of her
for over a year. Yeah.

06:28.688 --> 06:32.454
<i>David was not fit to be a father.</i>
<i>He wanted Brianna out of spite.</i>

06:32.525 --> 06:34.459
And he tried to drown me
in lawyer fees.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.257
Was your ex-husband violent
with you or Brianna?

06:37.330 --> 06:40.891
<i>Not physically, no.</i>
<i>But once when we were fighting...</i>

06:40.967 --> 06:45.666
he said that he would rather have Brianna
end up in a ditch somewhere than turn out like me.

06:49.275 --> 06:52.005
It's the "evening wear" category
that gets me.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.945
My evening wear's a ratty
T-shirt and a mud mask.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.347
There's bleeding evident
under the mental foramen.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.750
There was complete disruption
of all ventral ligaments...

07:00.820 --> 07:03.653
between the victim's skull
and the first and second vertebrae.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.782
Her neck was broken.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.883
Dislocated fracture of the mandible
suggests her death was caused...

07:07.960 --> 07:10.428
by a strong blow to the chin
by an object heavy enough...

07:10.496 --> 07:14.227
to leave markings
on her mental foramen.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.326
I found fragments of steel
in the victim's jacket.

07:17.403 --> 07:21.806
There was also an excessive amount
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.808
<i>I assume that means something.</i>

07:23.876 --> 07:26.367
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
are found in soot...

07:26.446 --> 07:29.904
<i>pesticides, creosotes, roofing tar.</i>

07:29.982 --> 07:33.179
The original police report said
Brianna's father was a roofer.

07:33.252 --> 07:35.482
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Interesting coincidence, huh?</i>

07:35.555 --> 07:39.013
- I'll call Booth.
- About this?

07:41.727 --> 07:45.219
- You have a roofing business?
- Uh, yeah.

07:45.298 --> 07:49.029
I... I... I went out on my own
when Brianna was born.

07:49.101 --> 07:52.036
<i>Thought I could make</i>
<i>some more money, you know?</i>

07:52.104 --> 07:54.595
<i>Do you use mastic asphalt</i>
<i>in your work?</i>

07:54.674 --> 07:56.869
Uh, yeah, for waterproofing.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.605
- <i>Why?</i>
- Were you working
the day your daughter disappeared?

07:59.679 --> 08:02.739
No. It was the weekend.
What are you guys getting at?

08:02.815 --> 08:05.784
We're just trying to piece things together.
That's all.

08:05.852 --> 08:09.015
Damn it! I answered all these questions
when Brianna first went missing.

08:10.456 --> 08:14.017
- This is Jackie's doing, right?
- You wanted your daughter back.

08:14.093 --> 08:17.585
Sometimes in a divorce, the emotions get
a little high, you don't know what you're doing.

08:17.663 --> 08:21.030
No. I know exactly what happened.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.400
Jackie wasted so much time having the cops
check me out, the case went cold.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.530
<i>This is all Jackie's fault.</i>

08:27.607 --> 08:30.371
Look.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.969
This was my little girl.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.071
Not whatJackie turned her into.

08:36.148 --> 08:39.583
This is who I wanted back.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.813
You, uh...

08:44.891 --> 08:46.950
You didn't give her
the remains, did you?

08:48.027 --> 08:50.222
No. We can't release them.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.628
Not before the investigation
is completed.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.531
I want her buried right.

08:55.601 --> 08:59.503
I don't want her funeral to be some
disgusting show Jackie puts on.

09:01.207 --> 09:06.304
I want to bury her
with some love, you know?

09:11.317 --> 09:14.650
[Beeping]

09:17.123 --> 09:19.057
How's it going?

09:19.125 --> 09:23.721
F.B.I. sent over the security tapes from
the hotel where Brianna's pageant was held.

09:23.796 --> 09:26.026
<i>I'm running them through</i>
<i>the body mass recognition program.</i>

09:26.098 --> 09:27.929
Maybe we'll find a shot of her
leaving with somebody.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.833
- <i>[Hodgins] Could you ever do this to your kid?</i>
- <i>[Angela] You know me.</i>

09:30.903 --> 09:34.031
I'm all about the swings.

09:34.106 --> 09:36.131
- Did you bring me something?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.006
This was in the zippered pocket
of what was left of Brianna's jacket.

09:39.078 --> 09:42.536
It's treated cellulose.
Can you get any details from it?

09:42.615 --> 09:45.243
I'll give it a shot.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.954
Listen, Angela.

09:51.524 --> 09:55.927
We've been dancing around this
for months now...

09:55.995 --> 09:59.328
like two pieces of neodymium
caught in a magnetic field.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.231
- [Chuckles] Is that good?
- Yeah.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.792
But if the field weakens, they fly apart.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.737
Which is why I thought
they should go on a date.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.700
- Hodgins...
- You can't say that you don't feel it.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.640
Come on.
We owe it to ourselves to give it a try.

10:20.820 --> 10:24.483
I... I just don't think
it would be a good idea.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.320
I mean, we work together, Jack.

10:28.394 --> 10:31.192
- Angela...
- I'm sorry.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.897
You're making a mistake.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.339
I'll examine the paper
after I go through the videos.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.900
Sure.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.877
<i>This is the rib cage</i>
<i>of a healthy 10-year-old girl.</i>

10:51.951 --> 10:55.751
And this... is our victim's rib cage.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.789
Ouch.

10:57.857 --> 11:01.224
<i>This is an X-ray of a teenage</i>
<i>girl who died in 1872.</i>

11:01.293 --> 11:04.751
- What caused the deformity? Was it genetic?
- It was a corset...

11:04.830 --> 11:06.798
<i>tightened a little more each day.</i>

11:06.866 --> 11:09.266
Based on the degree of misshaping...

11:09.335 --> 11:11.530
I'd say Brianna slept in one every night.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.630
- That's torture.
- <i>[Brennan] I imagine it was to give her...</i>

11:14.707 --> 11:18.268
an hourglass figure, which wouldn't be
possible naturally until well into puberty.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.812
You gotta be... You're telling me
her mom did this to her?

11:20.880 --> 11:24.873
<i>People have done much worse for beauty...</i>
<i>neck stretching, foot binding...</i>

11:24.950 --> 11:27.942
- Okay. And you're saying that makes it okay?
- Well, of course not.

11:28.020 --> 11:32.116
Any major alteration of our underlying
architecture demeans us.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.456
You know, we all have aspects of ourselves
we might wish were different.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.726
Yes. I wanted larger biceps before I became
comfortable with my mental acuity.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.927
- [Grunts]
- Here, you can see...

11:43.002 --> 11:47.302
<i>cribra orbitalia, suggesting Brianna</i>
<i>suffered from long-term malnourishment.</i>

11:47.373 --> 11:49.307
There's no enamel erosion
to indicate bulimia...

11:49.375 --> 11:53.937
so it's more likely she's been
on a calorie-controlled diet for at least two years.

11:54.013 --> 11:56.982
- Oh, it gets better.
- Oh, how can it not?

11:57.049 --> 11:59.950
<i>Her tox screen came back</i>
<i>with traces of somatropin...</i>

12:00.019 --> 12:01.987
tetracycline and glycopyrronium bromide.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.490
<i>[Zack] Human growth hormone,</i>
<i>broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat acne...</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:07.822
<i>and a chemical mixture</i>
<i>that controls perspiration.</i>

12:07.893 --> 12:10.361
All with serious side effects.

12:10.429 --> 12:12.329
No prescriptions were ever issued.

12:12.398 --> 12:16.095
<i>So Mom bound, starved</i>
<i>and drugged her.</i>

12:16.168 --> 12:18.102
That's heartwarming.

12:18.170 --> 12:22.129
<i>Our society puts a premium on beauty.</i>
<i>Common in declining cultures.</i>

12:22.208 --> 12:25.200
<i>Hey, guys,</i>
<i>you should take a look at this.</i>

12:27.980 --> 12:30.847
This was time-stamped a half hour...

12:30.916 --> 12:33.851
<i>beforeJackie Swanson</i>
<i>reported Brianna missing.</i>

12:33.919 --> 12:36.854
- There.
- Brianna, come on! Right now!

12:36.922 --> 12:40.187
- <i>[Brianna] Let go of me!</i>
- <i>[Shouting Continues]</i>

12:40.259 --> 12:43.695
<i>She said not a day goes by</i>
<i>that she doesn't hate herself.</i>

12:43.763 --> 12:46.197
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>I can see why.</i>

12:46.265 --> 12:49.325
lfJackie's willing to risk her child's life
to win these pageants...

12:49.401 --> 12:53.030
What would happen
if her daughter refused to compete?

13:02.114 --> 13:05.550
<i>What you have to understand</i>
<i>is that this was Brianna's dream, not mine.</i>

13:05.618 --> 13:09.054
You put your nine-year-old
daughter in a corset, Ms. Swanson.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.454
- A corset.
- Yeah. Brianna ordered that
off the Internet herself.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.516
And I didn't tighten it up very much.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.527
Did you ever think to tell Brianna...

13:16.595 --> 13:19.530
that she didn't need to alter
her physical appearance in order to be loved?

13:19.598 --> 13:23.056
- Did Brianna disappoint you somehow?
- No. She was a perfect angel.

13:23.135 --> 13:27.231
She won every competition, even her first one.
And after that, it was music and dance classes.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.434
- She was a real competitor.
- And when she won, it reflected well on you.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.273
That way you wouldn't have to deal
with your own physical identity.

13:33.345 --> 13:36.041
- I don't like her.
- Whoa.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.414
Let's... play a little
show-and-tell, shall we, hmm?

13:39.485 --> 13:43.216
How about this?
Can you explain these? This there.

13:43.289 --> 13:46.383
And then that one... my favorite one.

13:46.458 --> 13:49.359
Okay, these...

13:49.428 --> 13:52.226
these are right before
she disappeared.

13:52.298 --> 13:55.859
- We had a... disagreement.
- About the pageant?

13:55.935 --> 13:58.426
No. About her piano piece.
I suggested she use her elbow...

13:58.504 --> 14:02.065
to hit the last note with her head in her hands,
give the audience a little smile.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.473
- It's called dazzle.
- And she didn't want to do that?

14:04.543 --> 14:07.205
No. She didn't want dazzle.
She wanted to finish it perfectly.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.542
But it seems very silly now.

14:12.618 --> 14:15.883
- Only now?
- What happened immediately following this?

14:18.224 --> 14:22.888
I sent her up to our room, and I sent myself
to the hotel bar for a very large glass of rosé.

14:22.962 --> 14:26.329
And believe me, I was not the only mother
doing the exact same thing.

14:26.398 --> 14:31.768
Great. I'm sure you can provide me
with a list of the other mothers. Hmm?

14:33.472 --> 14:36.407
Blood would've rushed to the injured areas
that are evident on her X-rays...

14:36.475 --> 14:40.468
but there's no evidence of blood flow
here or here or here.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.480
So she was beaten after she died.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.516
The blows appear to be
consistent with kicking...

14:44.583 --> 14:47.575
but the dispersal pattern
is abnormal.

14:47.653 --> 14:49.985
Can you tell anything about the shoes?
Size? Make?

14:50.055 --> 14:53.855
Only that they are quite rigid,
possibly steel-toed.

14:53.926 --> 14:58.420
And Hodgins said he found
fragments of steel in the jacket.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.488
[Exhales]

15:02.768 --> 15:04.702
- Hodgins asked me out.
- [Gasps]

15:07.106 --> 15:09.370
Is that why you're hiding in here?

15:09.441 --> 15:11.875
I'm not hiding.
I need advice.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.606
What?
On a personal matter?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.875
- Yes.
- From me?

15:16.949 --> 15:20.350
- Yes.
- But romance is sort of...

15:21.987 --> 15:24.956
This is like me asking you
advice on phylogenetic systematics.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.151
Phylogenetic systematics.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.022
I have no idea what that is.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.691
- Exactly.
- Well, I can't ask Cam.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.225
- Can't ask Cam what?
- Oh, Hodgins asked Angela out on a date.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.171
- Brennan!
- What? Was it a secret?

15:41.240 --> 15:43.299
<i>It was a secret.</i>

15:43.375 --> 15:46.401
<i>I just came to ask if you'd made</i>
<i>any progress on the cellulose.</i>

15:46.478 --> 15:49.447
- No.
- Okay.

15:49.515 --> 15:52.814
Wait. You can't pretend
you didn't hear about this.

15:52.885 --> 15:56.548
- Fine. What'd you tell him?
- No.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.147
- Why?
- Because it would be a disaster.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.250
All of a sudden,
you have an opinion on this?

16:02.328 --> 16:05.092
You should never indulge in a romantic
relationship with someone you work with.

16:05.164 --> 16:07.860
- Why not?
- Well, anthropologically?

16:07.933 --> 16:10.265
There's an anthropological answer?

16:10.336 --> 16:13.499
An efficient workplace
is predicated upon a simple hierarchy.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.040
<i>Romance undermines that hierarchy.</i>

16:16.108 --> 16:21.273
This is like when I had an affair
with my thesis supervisor in college.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.838
Don't think we have time for that.
I say go.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.612
- What about this hierarchical-sexual?
- Won't be an issue.

16:26.685 --> 16:29.051
<i>It's always fun to flirt</i>
<i>in the workplace.</i>

16:29.121 --> 16:31.919
But out there, when fantasy
becomes a reality, it's a drag.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.856
What? The date will be bad?

16:33.926 --> 16:37.123
It will be awful.
You'll both realize it's not meant to be.

16:37.196 --> 16:41.064
<i>There'll be a couple days of awkwardness,</i>
<i>and then everything goes back to normal.</i>

16:41.133 --> 16:43.624
<i>If I were you,</i>
<i>I'd go with Cam on this one.</i>

16:43.702 --> 16:48.401
- Why?
- Phylogenetic systematics.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.643
I have to go to dance class.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.282
[Sighs]

16:57.483 --> 17:00.418
- <i># [Background: Disco]</i>
- <i>[Booth] Becky Swanson's alibi checks out.</i>

17:00.486 --> 17:02.477
She was in the bar
when Brianna disappeared.

17:02.554 --> 17:05.647
Can't we just prosecute her
for being horrible?

17:05.723 --> 17:07.714
That the dance teacher?

17:07.792 --> 17:10.489
- <i>[Booth] Yeah. That's Charlotte Craft.</i>
- Good.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.122
She owns the studio.
She also runs theJunior Miss Patriot Pageant.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.462
I mean, she's gotta be able
to give us something, right?

17:15.534 --> 17:17.468
I always wanted to take dance...

17:17.536 --> 17:20.800
- but I was so gawky and uncoordinated.
- What? You?

17:20.873 --> 17:24.205
Later I understood that
the gawkiness was caused...

17:24.276 --> 17:26.300
by an asymmetrical development
of the iliac crest.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.744
Oh, yeah. Because you know what?
That's what I would've guessed.

17:28.814 --> 17:32.580
- The old, uh, iliac crest.
- Hi. Which one's yours?

17:32.651 --> 17:35.017
- Hmm?
- Which what is what? What? Mine? Ours?

17:35.087 --> 17:37.248
Ours? Oh, no, no.

17:37.322 --> 17:40.485
Whoa. We're not...
[Chuckles] No. No, no. That's not...

17:40.559 --> 17:42.618
[Clears Throat]
We're... F.B.I.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.992
- Oh, wow. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.795
Oh, are you here
about Brianna Swanson?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.665
- Did you know Brianna?
- Yeah. Very well.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.705
I'm Kristen Mitchell.

17:53.772 --> 17:57.606
That's my daughter Ariel by the bar,
with the gray leg warmers.

17:57.676 --> 18:02.773
They... They took classes together,
were in the same pageants.

18:02.848 --> 18:06.306
Sometimes I can't help but wonder,
what if it had been Ariel who got kidnapped?

18:06.385 --> 18:09.218
Why do you assume she was kidnapped?

18:09.288 --> 18:12.155
Well, I can't imagine Brianna
just running away.

18:12.224 --> 18:15.990
Well, these pageants are very competitive.
There was a lot of pressure probably on her.

18:16.061 --> 18:19.827
[Scoffs]
To Brianna? Uh, no. No way.

18:19.898 --> 18:22.389
I mean, she had the face of an angel,
but underneath...

18:22.468 --> 18:26.564
<i>let's just say she had her sights set</i>
<i>on winning that pageant.</i>

18:26.638 --> 18:28.663
Why?

18:28.740 --> 18:31.800
- I don't understand the question.
- What's the draw here?

18:31.877 --> 18:34.869
Oh, my God.
The girls, they love it.

18:34.947 --> 18:39.884
They get to dress up all glamorous,
all the attention, the lights and the music.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.819
<i>All right, girls. That's enough for today.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

18:42.888 --> 18:45.982
<i>There's enough pressure</i>
<i>on young females...</i>

18:46.058 --> 18:48.083
without making them
prematurely sexualized.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.652
[Scoffs] I am sorry, but that is just
narrow-minded prejudice.

18:51.730 --> 18:56.099
I was in pageants my entire childhood.
I loved 'em.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.898
And they sent me to college
on a full scholarship.

19:00.005 --> 19:04.066
- <i>Hey, Mommy, I'm finished.</i>
- Hey, hon.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.077
Nice job.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.375
And good focus.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.711
- Thanks.
- [Chuckles]

19:10.782 --> 19:14.445
Well, I hope you find
the man responsible.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.581
Agent Booth?
I've got about 20 minutes till my next class.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.682
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

19:20.759 --> 19:23.785
- Oh, you know, why don't, uh...
why don't you go mingle?
- What? Why me?

19:23.862 --> 19:26.092
- Because you're a girl.
- What?

19:26.165 --> 19:30.124
Listen, because it's illegal for me to question
any of these kids without their parents, okay?

19:30.202 --> 19:33.365
Look, you're a civilian.
Okay? So take your pick.

19:33.438 --> 19:35.497
Good point.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.905
Behold the keepers of mystery...

19:40.979 --> 19:44.972
the <i>Sphecius speciosus</i>
and his trusty sidekick, the <i>Tibicen lyricen.</i>

19:45.050 --> 19:48.645
Ooh. Aah.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.711
What mystery?

19:50.789 --> 19:53.383
If Brianna Swanson was kidnapped,
they didn't take her far.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.722
The presence of these two species
together suggests that...

19:55.794 --> 19:59.093
she died within a one-mile radius
of the hotel where she disappeared.

19:59.164 --> 20:02.327
That whole area was thoroughly searched
within hours of her disappearance.

20:02.401 --> 20:06.804
Yeah. I think her body was jammed
into a storm culvert for over a month...

20:06.872 --> 20:09.500
until those thunderstorms
two weeks ago...

20:09.575 --> 20:12.009
Washed the remains
down to the treatment plant.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.204
F.B.I. forensics should check out
the culverts and drains...

20:14.279 --> 20:18.306
- large enough for a nine-year-old girl
around the hotel.
- I'll tell Booth.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.055
[Chuckling]
Hey.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.318
Don't come around again
looking for a second chance.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.792
That was a one-time offer, baby.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.421
Really? Hmm.

20:33.532 --> 20:36.524
No. What? No.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.536
No, no.
Not... Not really.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.437
I mean, it never occurred to me
that you would...

20:43.375 --> 20:46.208
Okay, now you talk.

20:46.278 --> 20:51.375
I accept going on a date
with you soon.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.318
- Tonight?
- [Chuckling]

20:55.387 --> 20:57.787
Wow. That is soon.

20:57.856 --> 20:59.949
I don't wanna give you time
to change your mind.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.785
What do you wanna do?

21:03.862 --> 21:05.853
You asked me.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.024
Figure it out.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.404
Thank you.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.307
- [Beeps]
- I took this at the pageant...

21:19.378 --> 21:22.370
about a half an hour
before Brianna disappeared.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.711
- Did you show it to the police?
- No.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.980
- Why not?
- Because he's not some murderous pedophile.

21:28.053 --> 21:31.784
- He's the 17-year-old brother
of one of the contestants.
- Then why'd you take his picture?

21:31.857 --> 21:34.849
Well, to show his parents how
creepy he seems hanging around.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.326
He could be such a good-looking boy.

21:37.396 --> 21:39.387
What's his name?

21:39.464 --> 21:41.591
Jeremy Ferrell.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.933
Look, I know he dresses in black and mopes
around, but he's totally harmless.

21:46.004 --> 21:50.600
- Hmm. I'm gonna need a copy of this picture.
- Certainly.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.576
<i>[Girl]</i>
<i>Is that a real skeleton?</i>

21:52.644 --> 21:55.044
Yes, of a 12-year-old
from the Bronze Age.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.547
These bones show
she'd already had children.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.846
- What killed her?
- Having the children.

21:59.918 --> 22:04.048
She should've waited to be
married before she had sex.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.181
You said "sex."

22:06.258 --> 22:09.091
Were you girls in theJunior
Miss Patriot Pageant?

22:09.161 --> 22:12.756
- I came in fourth.
- If Brianna was there, you'd have been fifth.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.425
<i>It must have been hard</i>
<i>to lose your friend like that.</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:19.561
Brianna was kind of mean.
She said Liza had cankles.

22:19.638 --> 22:23.472
- What are cankles?
- Where your calves and your ankles
are the same thing.

22:23.542 --> 22:28.479
She took my birthday watch too.
She'd take anything she liked.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.141
- So you weren't friends?
- You had to be friends with her.

22:31.216 --> 22:35.550
- Why?
- Because Brianna was the queen.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.986
So yours was a cultural structure...

22:38.056 --> 22:41.548
predicated on the equation
of beauty with power.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.821
You instinctively align
yourselves with someone...

22:43.895 --> 22:46.921
<i>who holds the greatest potential</i>
<i>for societal supremacy.</i>

22:46.998 --> 22:51.594
It's a Darwinian pressure
you're too young to bear.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.104
<i>Okay. Come on, Bones.</i>
<i>Up you go.</i>

22:54.172 --> 22:56.163
[Grunts]
There you go.

22:56.241 --> 22:58.607
- You have huge muscles.
- <i>[Booth] Thanks.</i>

22:58.677 --> 23:00.645
Learn anything?

23:00.712 --> 23:03.476
- <i>Yeah, I learned about cankles. How about you?</i>
- I found a possible suspect.

23:06.718 --> 23:10.119
<i>Well, Cam and Zack said that Brianna</i>
<i>was kicked with a steel-toed boot.</i>

23:10.188 --> 23:14.921
<i>Looks like my possible suspect</i>
<i>just became our primary suspect.</i>

23:22.701 --> 23:26.068
Of course.
I'm at every pageant.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.197
Okay, you see what happens?

23:28.273 --> 23:30.207
Look, I make him come...

23:30.275 --> 23:34.507
to carry Haley's changes
and the props for her talent competition.

23:34.579 --> 23:38.777
Well, you know, a lot of kids his age,
they'd... they'd just refuse.

23:38.850 --> 23:42.115
Okay, so what? So then
I'm a... I'm a bad kid because I'm a good kid?

23:42.187 --> 23:44.849
Mmm.
What do you call this look?

23:44.923 --> 23:48.154
- It's not a look.
- Emo. It's called emo.

23:48.226 --> 23:51.024
- No, it's not.
- It's short for overly emotive.

23:51.096 --> 23:54.463
No, Mom. No, it's not. Okay?
I like these clothes. I like this hair.

23:54.533 --> 23:57.661
It's not emo.
It's not anything.

23:58.970 --> 24:01.302
- You have a girlfriend?
- He does.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.898
She looks exactly like him.

24:03.975 --> 24:06.000
Are you guys, like,
real boyfriend and girlfriend?

24:06.077 --> 24:08.341
What do you mean?
What? Do we have sex?

24:08.413 --> 24:11.211
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Why? Because if we don't...

24:11.283 --> 24:13.911
then I'm just... I'm some pervert
who's got a thing for little girls?

24:13.985 --> 24:17.716
The day that this, uh, picture was taken,
did you speak with Brianna Swanson?

24:17.789 --> 24:20.724
- Yeah.
- Jeremy?

24:20.792 --> 24:25.820
- She was picking on my little sister.
- Oh. And did you argue?

24:25.897 --> 24:28.923
<i>You don't argue with a nine-year-old.</i>
<i>You call each other names.</i>

24:29.000 --> 24:31.833
Are you wearing the same shoes
that you wore that day?

24:31.903 --> 24:36.067
- No.
- Yes. He's worn the same thing
every day for a year.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.735
- <i>Would you be willing to give us those shoes?</i>
- No.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.038
- Yes.
- Mom!

24:40.111 --> 24:44.377
Just this once, Jeremy,
do what I tell you, okay?

24:44.449 --> 24:47.384
I... I know you didn't do this, honey.

24:47.452 --> 24:50.580
I know who you are under all this.

24:51.957 --> 24:54.448
Give the F.B.I. your shoes.

24:59.564 --> 25:01.498
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>Not the shoes.</i>

25:01.566 --> 25:04.433
- How do you know?
- First, the caps are plasticized chrome,
not stainless steel.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.199
<i>And they're too broad and rounded</i>
<i>to have caused the damage...</i>

25:07.272 --> 25:10.571
- to Brianna Swanson's bones.
- Tell Cam and Booth.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.545
- You do it.
- Why?

25:14.613 --> 25:16.808
Because I have a date.

25:19.818 --> 25:23.720
<i>Here's the thing, Angela.</i>
<i>I know you've been out with a lot of guys.</i>

25:23.788 --> 25:26.018
Hey, you have a different
girlfriend twice a month.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.389
Yeah. So imagine the pressure
to come up with a date...

25:28.460 --> 25:30.553
that neither one of us
has ever been on before.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.563
So what's up?

25:32.631 --> 25:35.964
We here to walk a dog or something?

25:36.034 --> 25:40.437
I remember what you said
about how you used to feel on a swing.

25:46.978 --> 25:49.208
[Whirring]

25:49.281 --> 25:51.681
It looks like colored dots,
but it's so faded.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.184
<i>Could this be a candy bar wrapper?</i>

25:54.252 --> 25:57.016
I don't think Brianna
was supposed to eat candy.

25:57.088 --> 26:00.285
There were a lot of things I wasn't
supposed to do as a kid. I still did them.

26:00.358 --> 26:04.226
- I haven't changed much.
- Bones, anything on the emo shoes?

26:04.296 --> 26:07.424
- Not a match. Sorry.
- What's with the, uh, Milk Blast Bar wrapper?

26:07.499 --> 26:09.933
Milk Blast Bar?

26:10.001 --> 26:12.299
- Yeah.
- What's a Milk Blast Bar?

26:12.370 --> 26:15.362
It's about the cheapest,
worst ice cream bar you can get.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.273

26:23.548 --> 26:25.539
I thought they stopped making them.

26:25.617 --> 26:27.881
Yeah. I thought I just ate 'em all.
[Chuckles, Snorts]

26:27.953 --> 26:30.786
Well, maybe we should determine
how Brianna Swanson got ahold of one.

26:30.855 --> 26:33.050
Brianna Swanson?

26:33.124 --> 26:35.285
- Hodgins found the wrapper with her remains.
- <i>[Dialing]</i>

26:35.360 --> 26:37.453
Yeah, it's Booth.
Listen, I need a search...

26:37.529 --> 26:39.463
for any Red Shed
convenience store...

26:39.531 --> 26:42.125
within a one-mile radius of
the Hyperion Hotel off of 171.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.997
Thanks.

26:44.069 --> 26:47.334
Look, I wouldn't have laughed so hard
if I knew it was Brianna Swanson.

26:50.575 --> 26:53.544
- <i>Oh, my God. I'm gonna puke.</i>
- <i>Put your head back. Head back! Head back!</i>

26:53.612 --> 26:56.080
Oh! I'm gonna puke.
I'm gonna puke.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.672
- No, don't. You all right?
- [Laughing]

26:58.750 --> 27:00.047
- Yes.
- Yeah?

27:00.118 --> 27:02.052
Not... Don't do it again.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.645
It was fun.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.691
I never thought
I'd be doing this again.

27:06.758 --> 27:08.726
- Really?
- Really.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.557
You know, I had a little dream
about it last night.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.997
- Did you?
- Yeah. It ended well too.

27:15.066 --> 27:20.197
- I'm sure it did.
- But you know what? You look much better here.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.205
Better than a dream, huh?

27:23.742 --> 27:26.370
You're shameless. All right,
you better get... get...

27:26.444 --> 27:29.675
You are gonna kill yourself.
[Chuckles]

27:29.748 --> 27:32.342
I wouldn't do that.

27:32.417 --> 27:35.079
- No?
- Not yet.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.415
What now?

27:55.607 --> 27:59.270
<i>Well, they carry Milk Blast Bars.</i>
<i>That's a start.</i>

27:59.344 --> 28:01.278
- These are good.
- Are you kidding me?

28:01.346 --> 28:03.814
These are God's food right here.

28:03.882 --> 28:08.376
So the F.B.I. forensic units
are sweeping the culverts near the hotel.

28:08.453 --> 28:12.287
So I figured, you know, while we were waiting,
we'd just go have a look around.

28:26.404 --> 28:30.170
- Right there. There it is.
- <i>[Brennan] Well hidden.</i>

28:30.241 --> 28:32.232
Yeah.

28:33.745 --> 28:38.341
Well, big enough to stuff
a child's body into.

28:38.416 --> 28:42.512
Oh, what do we got there?

28:49.594 --> 28:52.256
It's a pageant medal.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.628
Looks like we got
our crime scene, huh?

28:57.669 --> 29:01.332
<i>Crushing and scraping injuries</i>
<i>to the scapula...</i>

29:01.406 --> 29:04.466
are congruent with
Brianna Swanson being forced...

29:04.542 --> 29:06.806
into a culvert this size
in a prone position.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.937
The kicks to the back
were the attacker's attempt...

29:09.013 --> 29:11.948
to force the body farther into the culvert
where it couldn't be seen.

29:12.016 --> 29:15.474
<i>"Little Miss Raspberry Blossom,</i>
<i>Culpepper, Virginia. "</i>

29:15.553 --> 29:18.113
There were remnants of blood
on the medal before I cleaned it.

29:18.189 --> 29:21.818
- <i>I'm waiting to see</i>
<i>if it belongs to Brianna Swanson.</i>
- It's dated 1976.

29:21.893 --> 29:24.919
I got something.
Okay.

29:24.996 --> 29:26.987
- I don't know if this helps you.
- [Beeping]

29:27.065 --> 29:29.693

<i>"Lisa Fisher, 1976 Raspberry Queen.</i>

29:35.473 --> 29:39.739
That face.
Kristen Madigan.

29:41.279 --> 29:45.079
The mother that I spoke with
at the dance school was named Kristen.

29:45.150 --> 29:48.085
- Kristen Mitchell.
- Oh, my God.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.383
<i>It's like that Texas</i>
<i>cheerleading thing...</i>

29:50.455 --> 29:52.719
where the mother took out
her daughter's main competitor.

30:01.232 --> 30:05.191
Yes. My daughter did win the pageant
after Brianna disappeared.

30:05.270 --> 30:09.331
That's not a secret. The winner, Ariel,
went on to the national competition.

30:09.407 --> 30:11.898
And how did Ariel do in the nationals?

30:11.976 --> 30:15.878
- Very well. Finished in the top 10.
- <i>Top 10? Wow.</i>

30:15.947 --> 30:18.142
That probably wouldn't
have happened if, uh...

30:18.216 --> 30:20.582
Brianna Swanson
hadn't gone missing, right?

30:20.652 --> 30:24.053
You don't know that.
Nobody knows that.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.160
Where'd you get this?

30:31.229 --> 30:34.528
Oh, we found it...
at Brianna Swanson's crime scene.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.533
<i>Can you explain that?</i>

30:38.736 --> 30:41.967
Brianna Swanson was a thief,
Agent Booth.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.531
I mean, ask anybody.
She probably took it out of my bag.

30:44.609 --> 30:47.339
Did you report it missing?

30:47.412 --> 30:49.778
I'm not saying another word
until I get a lawyer.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.617
One, two...

30:54.686 --> 30:58.417
three, four.

30:58.489 --> 31:01.754
And she was kicked twice in the
same place here, twice as deep.

31:01.826 --> 31:04.158
So five, six.

31:04.229 --> 31:08.529
There's an asymmetry
both of force and distance to these kicks.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.626
<i>The fracture pattern suggests</i>
<i>a slight rotation to the blows.</i>

31:11.703 --> 31:14.263
- How slight?
- About 30 degrees.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.830
- Left side only?
- Yes.

Yeah. We're just sitting here,
you know, waiting for a lawyer.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.814
- Why?
- Okay, I need to know if her hips are even.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.088
Is that slang
or do you really mean "even"?

31:36.160 --> 31:39.926
<i>Stand behind her, place your hands on her hips.</i>
<i>Then move your hands up to her rib cage...</i>

31:39.998 --> 31:42.159
gauging if it's an equal
distance on each side.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.997
<i>That's so not gonna happen.</i>

31:45.069 --> 31:48.596

- Of course. We have to.

31:48.673 --> 31:50.800

Coming at you, Bones.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.013

Okay. I'm applying

[Beeping]

32:25.143 --> 32:27.077
No.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.306
- You might as well let her go, Booth.
- Why?

32:29.380 --> 32:32.008
She has very nice
symmetrical buttocks.

32:34.652 --> 32:36.813
Well, yeah. I know that.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.823
But, um, what's that
got to do with anything?

32:39.891 --> 32:42.758
Brianna Swanson's attacker
has a thoracolumbar curve.

32:42.827 --> 32:45.762
- Scoliosis.
- Sure. Meaning what?

32:45.830 --> 32:48.492
Kristen Mitchell is definitely
not the killer.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.234

The murder weapon?
Okay, well, what is it?

33:03.348 --> 33:06.181
- <i>A fore-stop trammel.</i>
- A what?

33:06.250 --> 33:09.276
- Hello.
- It's from the parking lot
at the Red Shed convenience store.

33:09.354 --> 33:12.050
The F.B.I. forensics team found
minute traces of blood on it.

33:12.123 --> 33:17.527
We brought it in here to compare the edging
with the marks on the victim's chin.

33:17.595 --> 33:20.530
- <i>[Brennan] And we can see here...</i>
- It's a match.

33:20.598 --> 33:25.501
The angle and force of the blow
suggest Brianna fell forward...

33:25.570 --> 33:29.131
was unable to break her fall
and caught her chin here.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.444
- Broke her neck instantly.
- <i>[Hodgins] Wanna hear about the steel?</i>

33:34.512 --> 33:38.915

33:41.886 --> 33:44.081
Remember the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons I talked about?

33:44.155 --> 33:47.784
- Absolutely not.
- Turns out that they weren't from roofing tar.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.454
- They were from asphalt.
- <i>So what you found on herjacket</i>
<i>was from her being dragged?</i>

33:51.529 --> 33:53.997
Exactly.
Wanna hear about the steel?

33:54.065 --> 33:58.968
<i>It wasn't from work boots.</i>
<i>It is the exact same steel used in tap shoes.</i>

<i>for a tap-dancing beauty queen with scoliosis.</i>

Right. Gotcha. Wait.
Half these kids have tap shoes.

34:14.685 --> 34:17.152
Well, we just need to examine

she can't just go around

What? I wasn't feeling like that.
That makes me sound like a pervert.

34:58.729 --> 35:01.823

- Just, well, examining really.

36:24.882 --> 36:27.908
[Applauding]

36:27.985 --> 36:30.647
[Murmurs]

36:33.558 --> 36:35.492
Oh, dude.
Not again.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.494
I thought you said
Jeremy was cleared.

36:37.562 --> 36:40.053
We know it's notJeremy.

36:40.131 --> 36:43.100
- We'd like to talk to Haley for a moment.
- No. I don't want to.

36:43.167 --> 36:46.261
This is a special day, Agent Booth.

36:46.337 --> 36:49.272
- You're upsetting her.
- Don't be afraid.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.467
No. You know, she should be afraid.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.016
I didn't do anything.
I promise.

36:59.083 --> 37:03.747
- We know you didn't mean to, Haley.
- Honey, what did you do?

37:05.189 --> 37:07.817
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>What did you do?</i>

37:11.028 --> 37:14.691
Brianna said she was gonna
buy me an ice cream.

37:14.765 --> 37:18.633
But she just made fun of me.
She said I was ugly.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.168
She said I'd never win anything.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.037
That must've hurt your feelings.

37:24.108 --> 37:27.441
I didn't mean to push her
so hard. Honest.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.738
<i>Oh, God.</i>

37:35.586 --> 37:39.716
- Why didn't you tell me?
- [Crying] The pageant was starting.

37:40.791 --> 37:43.157
I wanted to win.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.220
Oh. Oh, God.

38:08.252 --> 38:10.550
Hi.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.555
Hi.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.251
We didn't really
get a chance to talk today.

38:15.326 --> 38:19.023
Yeah.
I was avoiding you.

38:19.096 --> 38:24.329
That whole swing thing wasn't good enough, right?
'Cause I can do better.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.404
- It was perfect.
- It was?

38:29.473 --> 38:33.603
- Maybe the best date I've ever had.
- Really?

38:35.479 --> 38:38.175
Great. That's great.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.844
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- Yeah.

38:41.919 --> 38:44.444
That's not great.

38:45.623 --> 38:48.421
How can a great date be not great?

38:48.492 --> 38:51.586
Because it was
supposed to fall flat.

38:51.662 --> 38:55.029
That way, we'd both know
that this wasn't meant to be...

38:55.099 --> 38:57.294
and we'd go back
to the way we were before.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.802
I don't like the way it was before.

38:59.870 --> 39:04.239
Look, Brennan
is my best friend...

39:04.308 --> 39:07.277
and... Zack is...

39:07.345 --> 39:09.279
whatever the hell he is.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.680
And when this goes wrong, it...

39:12.750 --> 39:15.776
it pulls everybody else into it.

39:15.853 --> 39:19.755
And what the great date tells us...

39:19.824 --> 39:23.089
is that when it goes wrong...

39:23.160 --> 39:25.993
It'll go really, really wrong.

39:27.598 --> 39:29.657
Yeah.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.493
So...

39:35.106 --> 39:37.506
we go back, right?

39:40.845 --> 39:42.938
Friends.

39:43.013 --> 39:46.005
Sure, friends.

39:47.985 --> 39:50.146
Just one question.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.388
What if it doesn't end that way?

39:54.458 --> 39:56.790
What if it doesn't go wrong?

40:00.765 --> 40:02.756
Friends.

40:27.625 --> 40:29.786
This is what happened
when Rome fell.

40:29.860 --> 40:32.852
What? Uh, people ate
stale doughnuts?

40:32.930 --> 40:36.457
Objectification of women,
beauty as self-esteem.

40:36.534 --> 40:39.059
Well, I think, um...

40:39.136 --> 40:41.570
you know, some of those kids
actually had a good time.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.630
The girl in the pink
could really dance.

40:43.707 --> 40:46.505
But then again, Nero could
really play the fiddle.

40:46.577 --> 40:48.670
You know, Bones,
I like to think that, um...

40:48.746 --> 40:52.978
someplace deep inside,
people really know what's important.

40:53.050 --> 40:57.384
It's hard to believe when you see women
trying to disguise or change themselves.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.389
- Mmm.
- I never understood that.

40:59.457 --> 41:03.188
- Well, I mean, no, of course you wouldn't.
- Why?

41:03.260 --> 41:08.163
Well, it's just, you know,
someone who looks like you...

41:09.300 --> 41:11.768
well, wouldn't...

41:11.836 --> 41:13.736
Just because of the way you look.

41:13.804 --> 41:17.535
I don't understand.
What... way do I look?

41:17.608 --> 41:21.738
Well, you know, you're...
you're structured...

41:23.314 --> 41:25.578
very well.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.675
As are you.

41:36.660 --> 41:39.254
[Sighs]

41:39.330 --> 41:43.460
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:43.534 --> 41:46.401
It's just... Whew.

41:46.470 --> 41:48.597
I just... I remembered
that I had an appointment.

41:51.775 --> 41:55.211
Oh. So, um, I'll see you tomorrow?

42:03.387 --> 42:07.289
No. You know, you have all the
paperwork for the case, right?

42:07.358 --> 42:10.885
No. I was...
I was gonna stay and do it anyway, so...

42:10.961 --> 42:14.727
- No. You know, it's our case. I wanna help.
- You don't have to, Booth.

42:14.798 --> 42:17.323
- Bones, just drop it, okay? I'm here to help.
- <i># [Soft Rock]</i>

42:17.401 --> 42:21.667
Well, what about your appointment?

42:21.739 --> 42:25.175
Uh, it's... You know, it's no big deal.
I'll tell you what.

42:25.242 --> 42:30.441
How about I order some takeout
and I ditch these doughnuts?

42:30.514 --> 42:33.005
Sure.

42:34.351 --> 42:36.649

Thai food?

because you ate it last time.

42:46.163 --> 42:48.290
- All of it.
- What? I thought you were done.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.299
- Oh, right. I was done?
- Yeah.

42:50.367 --> 42:54.599
- You finished all of it.
- I did not. You were pretty focused
on the fried rice.

42:54.672 --> 42:57.937
- Can we just order? Okay?
- Fine.
