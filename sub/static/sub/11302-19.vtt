WEBVTT

00:06.465 --> 00:08.259
- Hey.
- What's up?

00:10.053 --> 00:12.764
You got there scrambled eggs, huh?

00:12.847 --> 00:16.100
Well, they started off over easy and
then I started thinking about Dad.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.686
[banging]

00:21.230 --> 00:22.857
Told him about the job, did you?

00:23.775 --> 00:24.776
- What'd he say?
- [sighs]

00:25.359 --> 00:28.237
He said, and I quote...

00:33.827 --> 00:35.286
[chuckles] That's pretty bad.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.830
Hang on. I'm not done.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.375
Damn.

00:42.293 --> 00:44.128
I'm sure he didn't mean that last part.

00:45.964 --> 00:48.592
He spends years telling me I'm
not good enough to run a ranch,

00:48.675 --> 00:49.735
then somebody wants to give me a shot

00:49.759 --> 00:51.302
and all of a sudden I'm the asshole?

00:51.385 --> 00:52.679
Yeah, that's messed up.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.263
You've always been an asshole.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.474
Exactly.

00:56.558 --> 00:59.811
Dad calling me an asshole is
like pot calling the kettle...

00:59.894 --> 01:01.229
an asshole.

01:03.522 --> 01:04.941
- Hey, Dad.
- [sighs]

01:05.942 --> 01:07.193
Hey, morning, Dad.

01:07.276 --> 01:09.195
Hustle it up. We've got cows to feed.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.404
[Colt] Yep.

01:10.488 --> 01:12.240
You guys need help?

01:16.410 --> 01:19.581
Oh, Dad, stop before you don't
say something you're gonna regret.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.751
You don't work here anymore.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.505
Yeah, I know, but I got two
weeks 'til my new job starts,

01:27.588 --> 01:28.715
so I can still help.

01:28.798 --> 01:32.093
Why don't you use that time
to find someplace else to live?

01:33.136 --> 01:34.178
What?

01:36.681 --> 01:38.767
You don't work here,
you don't live here.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.435
Let's get going.

01:42.771 --> 01:45.564
Dad, uh... you can't just kick him out.

01:45.649 --> 01:47.441
Colt, you know what?
Don't worry about it.

01:47.525 --> 01:49.378
You don't want me here?
Fine. I'm leaving right now.

01:49.402 --> 01:50.482
Oh, come on, dude. Come on.

01:50.528 --> 01:52.656
Well, apparently, I'm
not welcome here anymore.

01:52.739 --> 01:54.240
What're you...

01:54.323 --> 01:56.492
No one's welcome here. So what?

01:58.953 --> 02:00.705
Good luck, man. You're gonna need it.

02:02.832 --> 02:03.958
What're you doing?

02:04.042 --> 02:05.919
You don't like it, you can go with him.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.380
Where're you go...
What is everyone doing?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.465
Why can't this just
be like every other day

02:11.549 --> 02:13.259
where we all just hate each other?

02:15.637 --> 02:16.680
Fuck!

[country music playing]

03:21.619 --> 03:23.371
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.559
Weren't you that guy who used to
be a really good football player?

03:27.583 --> 03:28.626
[chuckles]

03:28.710 --> 03:32.630
Holy shit! You're <i>that</i> Colt Bennett?

03:34.382 --> 03:35.424
[chuckles]

03:37.010 --> 03:38.845
- Here you go.
- [Colt] Hey, Mom.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.388
Hey, you, uh, hear from Rooster?

03:40.471 --> 03:41.723
No, why?

03:41.806 --> 03:44.392
Oh, he told Dad about
that Neumann Hill job.

03:44.475 --> 03:46.352
- Dad kicked him out the house.
- What?

03:46.435 --> 03:49.313
Oh, God. Is he okay? Where'd he go?

03:49.397 --> 03:50.648
I don't know.

03:50.732 --> 03:53.902
He texted me. He's... he's with Berto.

03:53.985 --> 03:56.588
I don't know what they did, but
apparently his balls went to McDonald's.

03:56.612 --> 03:57.822
[groans] Oh!

03:59.741 --> 04:01.284
Why did I even look?

04:01.367 --> 04:03.912
But he should really
get that mole checked.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.664
[both] It's a birthmark.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.338
Well, apparently, they're
on their way over here.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.048
Oh, I think it's the best thing
that could have happened to him.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.425
Mom, he's homeless.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.218
Trust me, that's no fun.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.863
When I got cut from that team in Canada,

04:20.887 --> 04:22.764
I lived in my car for three months.

04:22.847 --> 04:24.473
Women do not respond well to,

04:24.557 --> 04:27.518
"Hey, let's take this party
back to my Kia Sorento."

04:30.479 --> 04:31.773
Well, it's kind of sad.

04:31.856 --> 04:34.025
I mean, your dad's driven
everyone away except the dog.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.568
Oh, I don't know.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.296
I've been watching Drake
when we're in the truck.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.114
I swear he's studying
how to work a stick shift.

04:40.990 --> 04:44.077
I'm saying that I love you,
but not in a sexual way.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.705
Unless of course, you know, we're stranded
on a desert island, in which case...

04:47.789 --> 04:49.582
I mean, I could do worse.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.251
Oh, you could do no better.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.089
Regardless, I would like
to stop talking about it.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.673
Oh, look, other people.

04:59.050 --> 05:01.302
- Hey, Colt.
- What's up?

05:01.385 --> 05:02.929
Mom, Abby.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.388
[all chuckle]

05:04.472 --> 05:05.514
I love you guys.

05:05.598 --> 05:07.809
[chuckles] Love you, too, Rooster.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.036
Wait, is this finally happening?

05:09.060 --> 05:10.311
Berto, you're out.

05:11.687 --> 05:12.897
How you doing, honey?

05:12.981 --> 05:13.982
Great.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.608
Been drinking for four straight hours.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.318
I feel no pain.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.946
I've been drinking for
four straight years.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.823
I can't feel my legs.

05:23.699 --> 05:24.951
[clears throat] So, wait.

05:25.034 --> 05:27.495
You've been drinking all day?
That's all you've been doing?

05:27.578 --> 05:30.081
No, no, no. I stopped
once to puke in a bucket.

05:31.249 --> 05:34.335
Yeah, it's too bad that bucket
belonged to a Salvation Army Santa.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.006
Yeah.

05:38.089 --> 05:39.774
Hey, I told Mom about
what happened with Dad.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.050
- Hmm.
- Look, Rooster,

05:41.134 --> 05:42.694
it might be hard to see at this moment,

05:42.760 --> 05:46.514
but I think it's a good thing for you
to get away from your dad, you know.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.017
It's a chance for you
to be your own man and...

05:49.100 --> 05:50.768
show the world what you've got.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.479
Kind of like a kid
going off to college...

05:53.562 --> 05:54.898
at 35.

05:55.899 --> 05:58.151
Yeah, I'm with you, Mom.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.914
Neumann's Hill is
gonna pay me more money,

05:59.986 --> 06:01.130
give me a better place to work,

06:01.154 --> 06:03.531
and give me two weeks of
vacation before I start.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.074
I could do anything.

06:05.158 --> 06:08.327
Shit, I could drive all the way
to Denver, keep on going to, uh...

06:09.954 --> 06:12.040
What's past Denver? Is that New York?

06:13.666 --> 06:14.708
That's bullshit.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.228
You don't know what's on
the other side of Denver,

06:16.252 --> 06:17.420
but to become a citizen,

06:17.503 --> 06:20.464
I have to know President
Garfield's middle name?

06:21.799 --> 06:22.967
Good one, dude.

06:23.051 --> 06:25.594
Garfield's a cat. His
middle name is lasagna.

06:28.932 --> 06:31.517
All right. Figured you
didn't wanna go home,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.412
so I stopped by and picked
up some of your shit.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.080
- Threw it in the back of my truck.
- Thanks, dude.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.564
No, you didn't let me finish.

06:36.647 --> 06:39.233
[chuckling] I hit a
curve, going real fast.

06:39.317 --> 06:41.527
All your shit flew out
into Copper Creek, so...

06:42.486 --> 06:46.574
I tried to fish out what I could,
and... Well, all I got was this.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.535
My toothbrush is red.

06:51.329 --> 06:52.663
Your new one's blue.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.861
Rooster, where're you gonna stay?

06:56.917 --> 07:01.505
Mmm... I'm hoping some place
between buzzed and shit-faced.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.510
Don't worry, Rooster. You can
stay with me in my Airstream.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.887
Oh, thanks, Mom. I'm probably
just gonna crash at Mary's.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.015
Thank God.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.278
- Maggie.
- Hey, Beau.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.865
- What're you doing?
- I'm taking shit.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.576
I figured since we're getting divorced,

07:30.659 --> 07:32.954
I'd just come and see if
there was anything I wanted

07:33.037 --> 07:35.081
that you don't care about.

07:35.164 --> 07:38.084
But it turns out, you
don't care about anything...

07:38.167 --> 07:39.377
including our son.

07:40.003 --> 07:41.795
Oh, I see what this is about.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.424
We got this on our
honeymoon. Do you like it?

07:45.508 --> 07:46.592
No.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.760
Great.

07:47.843 --> 07:51.055
I'll leave it right here, where
you have to look at it every day.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.600
I didn't kick Rooster out.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.102
He quit.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.646
His family's ranch wasn't
good enough for him.

07:59.272 --> 08:03.151
He's just taking the option
that's available to him.

08:03.234 --> 08:06.695
If you want to be mad at
someone, you should be mad at me.

08:07.363 --> 08:09.948
Are you under the
impression that I'm not?

08:10.574 --> 08:12.618
Rooster wasn't going anywhere here,

08:12.701 --> 08:16.122
so I called Ed Bishop to see
if he could use a good rancher.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.874
Wait, you set this up?

08:18.957 --> 08:20.584
That's right.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.461
I just wish I'd done it sooner.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.965
Oh, you've made this
divorce a whole lot easier.

08:27.050 --> 08:28.217
[sighs]

08:29.427 --> 08:31.554
I'll sign these papers,

08:31.637 --> 08:34.307
then you can get the
hell out of my house.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.659
[scoffs] "Get the hell out of my house."

08:35.683 --> 08:37.934
You know you ought to put
that on your welcome mat.

08:38.019 --> 08:39.727
Ooh, the welcome mat.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.397
Oh, I'll get it on the way out.

08:42.398 --> 08:43.524
What the hell?

08:44.107 --> 08:46.985
You want the hunting cabin
and the land around it?

08:47.070 --> 08:48.154
That's right. [Chuckles]

08:48.237 --> 08:50.989
I care about this ranch, too,
and I want a little piece of it.

08:51.907 --> 08:54.243
I also want it in
writing, that when you die,

08:54.327 --> 08:55.661
the boys get the ranch.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.913
You can have the cabin.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.291
I'm leaving the ranch to Colt.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.460
[scoffs] Really?

09:02.543 --> 09:05.421
After you die, Colt will just
give half to Rooster anyway.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.923
I don't care what happens after I die.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.135
He gave up on this place.

09:12.095 --> 09:13.554
I'm not giving it back to him.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.641
Oh, good, Beau. At least
you have your pride.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.230
Yeah, my pride and
this lovely candy dish.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.943
[Spanish music playing on stereo]

09:28.026 --> 09:30.196
[singing in Spanish]

09:34.283 --> 09:36.285
- [in English] Oh, what a song.
- Yeah.

09:36.369 --> 09:37.661
[chuckles]

09:37.745 --> 09:39.580
This guy falls in love with a woman.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.708
For their ninth anniversary
he buys her a little kitty-cat,

09:42.791 --> 09:44.918
and she just cries with joy.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.298
Oh, no, uh, Colt.

09:50.133 --> 09:53.719
This song is about a man who
murdered his wife and his best friend,

09:53.802 --> 09:55.596
and is about to be put to death.

09:57.681 --> 09:58.724
Really?

09:58.807 --> 09:59.850
Yes.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.436
[softly] Oh.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.481
So... when I played in Barcelona

10:05.564 --> 10:09.067
and the fans were cheering,
<i>"Mata al nueve..."</i>

10:10.528 --> 10:12.696
They weren't saying,
"We love number nine"?

10:13.739 --> 10:16.492
No. They were saying, "Kill
number nine." [chuckles]

10:17.910 --> 10:19.346
No wonder I couldn't keep a girlfriend.

10:19.370 --> 10:21.530
I kept telling them I was
gonna murder them. [Chuckles]

10:21.872 --> 10:23.291
- Exactly.
- Fuck.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.668
[groans]

10:25.751 --> 10:27.461
Man, this is fucked up.

10:27.545 --> 10:31.674
I'm going home, and Rooster
ain't even gonna be there. [Sighs]

10:31.757 --> 10:33.176
Yeah, I feel so bad for Rooster.

10:33.259 --> 10:35.844
Stuck in a house with
beautiful blonde women.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.263
[scoffs]

10:37.346 --> 10:40.599
I have to share a one bedroom
apartment with my two cousins.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.935
The toilet is practically
in the kitchen.

10:44.145 --> 10:46.355
Yeah, they say you shouldn't
shit where you eat...

10:47.440 --> 10:48.649
but we must.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.297
You make good money at Neumann's Hill.

10:53.321 --> 10:54.798
Why don't you just get your own place?

10:54.822 --> 10:57.741
Oh, I send most of my money
to my family back home.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.287
Yeah, I get it.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.456
When I was down in Orlando,

11:03.539 --> 11:07.668
I sent my dad a commemorative
SeaWorld fishing rod.

11:08.419 --> 11:09.628
Wrapped.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.088
I think he appreciated it.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.051
Yeah. Same thing.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.932
Seriously, though, that's
one hell of a sacrifice.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.058
Not really.

11:24.352 --> 11:26.437
It's my family. My family's my life.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.021
I'd do anything for my family.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.152
When I was a kid...

11:34.737 --> 11:36.405
Rooster tried to take the last biscuit.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.199
I stabbed his hand with a fork.

11:42.453 --> 11:44.872
Kinda makes me feel
like a bit of an asshole.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.333
Ah, don't be so hard on yourself.

11:48.376 --> 11:50.210
I'd kill a man for a Cinnabon.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.432
How'd that fence look?

12:03.516 --> 12:05.225
- [truck door closes]
- The fence is fine.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.686
Get those limbs off?

12:08.437 --> 12:10.230
Yep. [Grunts]

12:10.314 --> 12:11.815
Think we're missing a cow, though.

12:11.899 --> 12:15.027
Before you ask... yes, I double-checked.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.195
[sniffs] And, yes, I know how to count.

12:19.031 --> 12:21.575
And, no, I did not use
my fingers and toes.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.496
What do you mean we're missing a cow?

12:27.623 --> 12:29.333
Uh, how do I put this?

12:30.459 --> 12:33.712
There's a giant brown
and white creature...

12:36.214 --> 12:38.301
it was there yesterday.

12:38.384 --> 12:39.885
It ain't there today.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.307
I don't know how it got out. I
didn't see any breaks in the fence.

12:44.390 --> 12:47.643
I don't think a mountain lion got it
'cause I didn't see any carcasses, so...

12:48.185 --> 12:50.103
Damn it. How do you lose a cow?

12:50.187 --> 12:51.647
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.191
First... first of all,
I did not lose a cow.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.360
I noticed the cow was lost.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.154
And it happens all the time.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.917
How many cows have you
lost over the years?

13:00.948 --> 13:04.452
I bet if I tied a beer can to its
ass, you wouldn't have lost it.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.622
Okay, first of all,

13:08.706 --> 13:10.791
that's a great idea. [Chuckles]

13:12.793 --> 13:14.252
And second... [sighs]

13:15.170 --> 13:17.047
I know you ain't mad at me about a cow.

13:18.716 --> 13:20.551
You're just lashing
out 'cause of Rooster.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.973
You made a mistake throwing him out.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.311
First off, I disagree.

13:32.688 --> 13:34.357
And secondly, you're wrong.

13:39.362 --> 13:40.363
Dad...

13:42.114 --> 13:43.532
as long as I can remember...

13:44.617 --> 13:46.243
Rooster stood by your side.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.121
You're partners.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.875
You're like Batman and Robin.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.794
You're like Terrell
Davis and John Elway.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.963
Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers.

14:00.549 --> 14:03.176
You guys are islands in a stream.

14:05.721 --> 14:07.264
That is what you are.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.434
Are you done?

14:11.685 --> 14:12.978
Dad, I know...

14:14.522 --> 14:15.939
you feel betrayed.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.654
But he's not just your
employee. He's your son.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.197
He's family.

14:25.408 --> 14:26.659
And family's everything.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.745
That's right.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.415
He's my son.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.709
I taught him everything he knows.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.713
And my thanks?

14:39.797 --> 14:42.883
He takes off because I didn't
put him in charge fast enough.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.606
Dad, I'm not saying
that Rooster's right.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.763
I'm just saying you should
talk to him. That's all.

14:49.682 --> 14:51.934
[stammers] I knew you were
gonna say that. [Chuckles]

14:56.897 --> 14:59.357
Hey, got you a can of dip.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.319
Thank you.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.572
You owe me six bucks.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.953
This is great.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.246
I didn't think I was gonna
get to see you tonight.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.832
- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

15:14.915 --> 15:16.374
- Ooh.
- [chuckles]

15:18.669 --> 15:20.796
That was great. You got a beer?

15:20.879 --> 15:22.214
[chuckles]

15:23.882 --> 15:26.552
How was school? Make any kids cry today?

15:26.635 --> 15:28.386
No, it sucked.

15:28.471 --> 15:29.888
- Tomorrow's a new day.
- [chuckles]

15:29.972 --> 15:30.973
How are you?

15:32.475 --> 15:35.644
Ah, did the work of two guys today.

15:35.728 --> 15:36.979
I lost a cow.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.616
Saw a cloud that looked
like a butt, though.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.735
How's it going without Rooster?

15:43.777 --> 15:44.862
It sucks.

15:44.945 --> 15:45.946
Mmm-hmm.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.492
I don't know. He made things fun.

15:49.575 --> 15:52.495
[stammers] You ever play horse
with a shovel full of cow shit

15:52.578 --> 15:54.329
and a bucket on the
other side of the barn?

15:54.412 --> 15:56.414
Oh. [Chuckles] It's awesome.

15:56.499 --> 15:58.375
But then you do it by yourself, and...

15:59.585 --> 16:01.504
you're just playing with shit.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.339
I never thought about it that way.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.174
- Or at all.
- [chuckles]

16:06.258 --> 16:08.469
Uh... He's...

16:08.552 --> 16:09.887
He's kind of a buffer.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.430
You know? Now it's just me and my dad.

16:12.515 --> 16:13.516
Day and night.

16:13.599 --> 16:17.520
Work all day, and come home, and
have dinner and watch TV together...

16:17.603 --> 16:19.396
argue over the remote.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.315
He's like a... grumpy old
mustached wife. [Chuckles]

16:22.399 --> 16:24.442
Aww, that could be me one day.

16:26.612 --> 16:29.281
[smacks lips] I don't know
how much longer I can take it.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.700
Hmm, you know what you need?

16:32.910 --> 16:34.161
A teachers' lounge.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.997
A place to get away. A place to think.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.291
A place to smoke the pot
you confiscate from the kids.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.586
I knew the teachers smoked
it when they took my weed.

16:42.670 --> 16:45.881
[chuckles] What if I became
your teachers' lounge?

16:45.964 --> 16:48.175
I don't know what that means,
but I like it. [Chuckles]

16:48.884 --> 16:50.761
No, I mean this place.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.605
You know, when things get too much
with your dad, you could come here.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.517
You never want me to leave, huh?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.061
- I didn't say that.
- [both chuckle]

16:59.144 --> 17:00.478
But, here...

17:01.980 --> 17:03.106
Think of this...

17:05.025 --> 17:06.026
as your place.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.695
That's so sweet.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.906
Thank you. Oh, this says, "Kenny's key."

17:10.989 --> 17:12.991
Oh... I'll take this,
and I'll give you mine.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.326
[chuckles]

17:18.664 --> 17:19.957
Tell you what.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.126
Next time I go to a Broncos game,
I am wearing one of these things.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.271
You know, usually I can only
fit like six beers in my jeans.

17:26.296 --> 17:29.257
But with this thing, I
could fit a whole pony keg.

17:30.718 --> 17:32.737
Hey, thanks again for watching
Darlene's baby, Rooster.

17:32.761 --> 17:34.387
Oh. My pleasure.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.557
You know, hanging out
with babies is kind of like

17:36.640 --> 17:38.141
hanging out with drunk people.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.560
They babble incoherently,

17:39.643 --> 17:42.395
cry till they get another
bottle, and shit themselves.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.650
Oh, and thank you...

17:47.568 --> 17:49.111
I'm sorry. I forgot your name.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.989
Oh, it's, uh, Umberto.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.783
And you can remember
it because it's like...

17:54.867 --> 17:56.577
[moaning] "Mmm, Berto."

17:58.161 --> 17:59.747
Hmm... no thanks.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.708
Mmm... embarrassing.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.211
Hey, Darlene, are you ready to go yet?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.422
Stupid swollen breasts, I
can't find a bra that fits me...

18:09.506 --> 18:10.507
Oh.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.343
Hey. Sorry.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.345
I'm Darlene.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.890
Oh, uh, no apologies necessary, Darlene.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.392
[chuckles] I am Umberto.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.102
It's like, uh...

18:22.185 --> 18:24.271
[moaning] "Mmm, Berto."

18:26.564 --> 18:28.609
Hmm... maybe. [Chuckles]

18:30.944 --> 18:33.006
I can't remember the last
time we had a ladies night.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.322
I do.

18:34.406 --> 18:36.074
It was the last time you got pregnant.

18:37.743 --> 18:39.286
- Hey, y'all.
- [Rooster] Oh, hey.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.829
There she is.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.873
The womb that started it all.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.583
I thought you had the dinner shift.

18:45.668 --> 18:47.002
Oh, yeah, I got off early.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.229
Some guy grabbed my ass and said,

18:48.253 --> 18:50.255
"Can I get some more
hot cakes, hot cakes?"

18:50.338 --> 18:51.632
So I punched him in the throat.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.133
Manager gave him a free dessert

18:53.216 --> 18:55.468
and told me to take the
rest of the night off.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.804
America, huh?

18:57.595 --> 19:01.266
So, he grabbed your ass
and he got a free dessert?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.560
Is that policy there?

19:05.103 --> 19:06.563
Trust me, it's not.

19:07.648 --> 19:09.441
- We should get going.
- Yeah.

19:09.524 --> 19:10.752
Oh, well... [stammering] now that...

19:10.776 --> 19:16.824
That <i>Gallo</i> and Mrs. <i>Gallo</i>
are here, perhaps, uh, I am free to join?

19:16.907 --> 19:19.743
Sorry, Umberto, it's...
[chuckles] kind of a ladies night.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.954
How about I drive and you
can get as drunk as you want?

19:23.038 --> 19:24.206
Fuck, yeah!

19:24.289 --> 19:25.833
[Rooster laughs]

19:25.916 --> 19:27.476
Hey, who's getting a new little sister?

19:27.542 --> 19:28.669
Yes, you are.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.173
[sighs] Bye, Mom.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.424
[both] Bye.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.511
Hey, you know, there's no rule
against just blowing a guy.

19:39.972 --> 19:40.973
[door closes]

19:42.725 --> 19:43.851
You're a good mom.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.230
Yeah, I like your friend. He's cute.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.398
Yeah, he's a good guy.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.859
Not as cute as me though, right?

19:52.442 --> 19:53.777
Yeah, looks aren't everything.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.571
I'm kidding.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.115
[both chuckle]

19:58.198 --> 19:59.592
Hey, what time did you finally get up?

19:59.616 --> 20:01.260
- [sighs]
- You were dead to the world when I left.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.327
I don't know.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.250
Must have been sometime
between 10:00 and 11:00

20:04.287 --> 20:05.847
'cause the <i>Price is Right</i> was still on.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.833
[chuckles] Fucking Plinko, man.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.376
- Still good.
- [chuckles]

20:10.335 --> 20:11.544
Good for you.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.308
When was the last time
you slept that late?

20:13.881 --> 20:15.758
Uh, besides jail?

20:15.841 --> 20:17.134
I had mono in the fifth grade.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.969
Wait, you were in jail?

20:19.594 --> 20:20.971
Relax. I said jail, not prison.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.264
[chuckles]

20:22.347 --> 20:23.707
- [sighs]
- You hear from your dad?

20:23.766 --> 20:26.018
Oh, yeah. Won't stop
blowing up my phone.

20:26.101 --> 20:29.062
Texting me, "Where's my
BFF? I miss you so much.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.898
You're dead to me."

20:30.981 --> 20:33.233
Well, this can't be
easy for him, either.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.443
He's stuck over there
with your shithead brother.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.737
Yeah, that's true.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.946
I mean... [scoffs]

20:38.030 --> 20:39.948
I knew he'd be pissed
when I took this job.

20:40.032 --> 20:42.159
I did not see him throwing
me out of my own house.

20:42.242 --> 20:45.996
Oh, baby, nobody takes it well
when you tell them you're leaving.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.040
My husband told me, I
punched him in the throat.

20:48.123 --> 20:51.126
[chuckles] Damn, that
seems to be your go-to move.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.603
I'm surprised you
haven't been in prison.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.087
Who says I haven't?

20:55.713 --> 20:57.925
Damn. I have never wanted
you more than right now.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.009
[chuckles]

21:00.177 --> 21:01.678
Hang on a second.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.263
That kid watching?

21:03.346 --> 21:06.308
Oh, you have no idea
what that kid has watched.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.893
[both chuckle]

21:10.687 --> 21:12.314
Hey, Maggie.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.042
You know, with all the
lights off out there,

21:14.066 --> 21:15.901
I almost drove right by this place.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.278
[chuckles] I guess,
that would have been, uh,

21:18.361 --> 21:21.323
the second time that this old
lawyer passed the bar. [Chuckles]

21:23.116 --> 21:25.118
You see? Passed the bar? Bar exam?

21:26.078 --> 21:28.288
Lawyer? [Chuckles]

21:28.371 --> 21:30.623
[sighs] Can I get a beer?

21:30.707 --> 21:33.251
Yeah, sure. Uh, $20.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.921
What? For... for a beer?

21:36.004 --> 21:38.090
Well, why not? You overcharge me.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.136
Oh, hey, Beau.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.429
How are you doing?

21:44.512 --> 21:45.973
How do you think I'm doing?

21:46.056 --> 21:49.642
I'm here with my soon-to-be
ex-wife and a damn lawyer.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.686
No offense, Jerry.

21:53.271 --> 21:54.481
Nice shirt.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.859
Oh, Eddie Bauer outlet. [Chuckles]

21:58.068 --> 21:59.402
It's reversible.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.075
So...

22:05.158 --> 22:08.411
I have all your divorce papers here.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.581
Here you go.

22:19.965 --> 22:22.800
I thought I made it clear
that I was leaving the ranch

22:22.885 --> 22:25.012
only to Colt, not Rooster.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.721
Beau, I know you're upset.

22:26.804 --> 22:30.058
But I... I just want Rooster
to get what he deserves.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.352
He got what he deserved.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.812
Okay, that's why Jerry's here.

22:34.897 --> 22:35.939
Uh, no.

22:36.023 --> 22:39.526
Jerry is here because he bought
a boat last summer. [Chuckles]

22:40.527 --> 22:44.156
Ah, never go to a boat show on acid.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.119
Look, I'm not trying to
make this more difficult.

22:49.202 --> 22:52.455
I just think if you're not willing
to leave the ranch to both boys,

22:52.539 --> 22:53.623
then we'll go to court,

22:53.706 --> 22:56.001
we'll sell the ranch and
we'll split the money.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.835
You've gotta be kidding me.

22:59.004 --> 23:01.839
That ranch has been in this
family for four generations.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.633
You cannot be serious.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.219
Oh, yeah. I'm serious.

23:08.180 --> 23:09.222
Hey.

23:09.306 --> 23:10.432
We're closed, Hank.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.225
Even for emergencies?

23:13.893 --> 23:14.894
See you tomorrow.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.196
I think I went to law
school with that guy.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.076
Are we done here?

23:29.159 --> 23:30.868
'Cause I'm not signing this.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.413
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.123
[Jerry takes deep breath]

23:35.207 --> 23:37.375
Beau, I should say at this point

23:37.459 --> 23:40.378
that I think you need
to find your own lawyer.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.924
I'm gonna head back to the ranch...

23:45.633 --> 23:47.927
while it's still mine to go back to.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.477
- [sighs]
- [door closes]

23:57.604 --> 23:58.813
[sighs]

24:00.773 --> 24:02.609
So, I...

24:02.692 --> 24:05.695
guess you're gonna probably
come into quite a bit of money.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.451
Any interest in buying a boat?

24:23.713 --> 24:24.756
[Colt] Hey.

24:24.839 --> 24:26.924
Hey. About time.

24:27.009 --> 24:28.176
I was gonna leave.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.469
What are you doing here?

24:29.552 --> 24:32.389
Well, came by to grab some of my stuff

24:32.472 --> 24:33.657
and I saw Dad's whiskey sitting there,

24:33.681 --> 24:35.201
and I knew he'd get pissed
if some of it went missing.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.520
So, poured a big old glass,
then I dumped it down the sink.

24:39.229 --> 24:40.438
Then I poured this glass.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.191
You know he's gonna blame me.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.152
I know. That's what's so funny about it.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.821
- You want some?
- What? No.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.616
Oh, okay.

24:55.078 --> 24:57.122
Is that a T-bone over there in the snow?

24:57.205 --> 24:58.456
Don't worry about it.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.751
Hey, listen.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.045
[grunts]

25:03.128 --> 25:04.337
I talked to Ed Bishop today.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.674
[clicks tongue] He told me,

25:07.757 --> 25:10.635
I could hire whoever I want
to come work on the ranch.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.011
Well, that's awesome.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.889
Yep. I wanna hire you.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.435
[scoffs] What?

25:18.518 --> 25:20.978
That ranch is five times
the size of this one.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.356
Umberto and I can't
do all that work alone.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.485
- You serious?
- Yeah.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.904
Plus, if I hire a special needs
person, we get a tax break.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.868
I appreciate you thinking of me.

25:39.331 --> 25:41.458
Don't think I can bail on Dad like that.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.512
You know what it's gonna
be like around here?

25:46.921 --> 25:47.964
I know.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.174
I mean, I'm the favorite.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.633
- He kicked me out.
- I know.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.195
Plus, you're not even
that good at ranching.

25:52.219 --> 25:54.929
All right, this is the weirdest
job interview I've ever had.

25:56.473 --> 25:57.640
[vehicle approaching]

25:57.724 --> 26:00.102
There's Dad. Better get
the hell out of here.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.561
Why? I'm not scared of Dad.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.230
Oh, shit, the bottle.

26:09.444 --> 26:10.862
- [truck door closes]
- Hey, Dad.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.947
What are you doing here?

26:14.657 --> 26:15.908
Can't talk to my own brother?

26:19.078 --> 26:20.330
Sure you can.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.789
Just not here.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.627
All right, fine.

26:25.710 --> 26:29.131
Well, I just came by to offer
Colt a job working with me.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.039
You can start whenever you want.

26:37.597 --> 26:38.973
It's good to see you, Dad.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.106
I didn't know he was coming.

26:48.525 --> 26:51.278
Not... I wouldn't do anything
without talking to you first.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.240
Do whatever you want.

27:06.418 --> 27:09.671
- [Drake growls softly]
- Dude, you better eat that thing fast.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.636
