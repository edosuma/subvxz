WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.605
PORTER SCAVO,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST.
 WHAT?!

00:04.605 --> 00:06.437
PORTER HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT FIRE.
 APPARENTLY THERE IS A WITNESS
THAT SAYS OTHERWISE.

00:06.437 --> 00:09.140
A WITNESS? WHAT ARE
THEY TALKING ABOUT?

00:09.140 --> 00:12.012
PORTER WAS ACCUSED
BUT NOT CONVICTED.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.145
KATHERINE'S LOVE AFFAIR...

00:14.145 --> 00:17.218
I GOT THE FLOWERS.
 BECAME SERIOUS.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.019
MOMMY NEEDS TO LOSE
A FEW POUNDS.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.622
YOU WANNA HELP MOMMY
BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN?
 NO.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.524
AS DID GABY'S RESOLVE.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.456
HERE'S MY COOKBOOK.

00:25.456 --> 00:27.498
AND BREE'S SUCCESS
CAME AT A PRICE.

00:27.498 --> 00:28.799
YOU CAN BE A LITTLE TOUGH
SOMETIMES.

00:28.799 --> 00:31.762
IT'S ONLY TO BE EXPECTED.
 I DON'T THINK I DO THAT.

00:31.762 --> 00:33.304
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

00:40.811 --> 00:43.274
(Mary Alice)
PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT MONEY

00:43.274 --> 00:46.046
IN THE SUBURBS...

00:46.046 --> 00:49.550
MOSTLY
BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.552
THE ONES WHO HAVE IT

00:51.552 --> 00:55.726
LET YOU KNOW
WITH THEIR BRAND-NEW CLOTHES...

00:55.726 --> 00:59.130
THEIR EXPENSIVE APPLIANCES...

00:59.130 --> 01:00.631
THOSE ARE GOOD.

01:00.631 --> 01:03.134
AND THEIR MANICURED LAWNS.

01:03.134 --> 01:05.666
THE ONES WHO DON'T HAVE IT

01:05.666 --> 01:09.140
LET YOU KNOW WITH BARBECUES
THAT NEED REPLACING...

01:09.140 --> 01:12.643
WALLS THAT NEED PAINTING...

01:12.643 --> 01:15.346
AND CLASSIC CARS...

01:15.346 --> 01:18.109
THAT NEED TO BE SOLD.

01:18.109 --> 01:22.113
HEY YOU GO, WALTER.
SHE'S ALL YOURS.
 THIS IS SO AWESOME!

01:22.113 --> 01:24.115
WHERE'S TOM?
I WANNA THANK HIM

01:24.115 --> 01:27.118
FOR MAKING THIS
THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
 HE'S INSIDE,

01:27.118 --> 01:30.090
BUT BETWEEN SOBS,
HE WISHED YOU HAPPY DRIVING.
 (pats back)

01:30.090 --> 01:32.092
(starts engine)

01:32.092 --> 01:34.425
(chuckles)

01:34.425 --> 01:37.128
WHERE IS THAT MAN GOING
WITH TOM'S CAR?

01:37.128 --> 01:40.131
OH, THAT MAN IS WALTER BROTSKI,
AND HE JUST BOUGHT IT.

01:40.131 --> 01:42.433
TOM LOVES THAT CAR.
WHY WOULD YOU SELL IT?

01:42.433 --> 01:45.136
SADLY, WE CAN NO LONGER
AFFORD TOM'S MIDLIFE CRISIS.

01:45.136 --> 01:46.437
(laughs)
 (chuckles)

01:46.437 --> 01:48.709
OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.
WE'RE...
 (sighs)

01:48.709 --> 01:50.381
SORT OF BROKE.

01:50.381 --> 01:52.183
OH.

01:52.183 --> 01:53.184
LYNETTE.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.216
BETWEEN PORTER'S LEGAL FEES

01:55.216 --> 01:57.888
AND THAT GHOST TOWN
THAT WE CALL A RESTAURANT...

01:57.888 --> 02:01.392
I THOUGHT SCAVO'S
WAS DOING WELL.
 WHEN TIMES GET TOUGH,

02:01.392 --> 02:03.894
PEOPLE DO WITHOUT THINGS
LIKE PIZZA AND SPORTS CARS.

02:03.894 --> 02:07.228
I AM SO SORRY.
I HAD NO IDEA.
 IT'S OKAY.

02:07.228 --> 02:10.901
JUST KEEP IT UNDER YOUR HAT.
IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING.
 YOU SHOULD NOT BE EMBARRASSED.

02:10.901 --> 02:13.904
THIS IS A HORRIBLE ECONOMY.
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT.
 MM.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.666
(horn honks)

02:18.209 --> 02:22.142
(laughs) HELLO, LADIES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.175
YOU BOUGHT A NEW CAR?

02:24.175 --> 02:27.147
MY BOOK JUST MADE
THE "TIMES'" BEST SELLER LIST.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.721
NOW THEY'RE TALKING 3-BOOK DEAL,
SO I GOT THE URGE TO SPLURGE.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.654
OH!

02:33.654 --> 02:37.188
AND LOOK WHAT JUST BLEW ON
MY WINDSHIELD AT THE STOP SIGN!

02:37.188 --> 02:38.529
AH!

02:38.529 --> 02:40.531
LIFE IS GOOD.

02:40.531 --> 02:45.165
YES, PEOPLE DON'T TALK
ABOUT MONEY IN THE SUBURBS

02:45.165 --> 02:47.167
BECAUSE WHEN THEY DO,

02:47.167 --> 02:50.201
OTHER PEOPLE GET ANGRY.

03:01.252 --> 03:04.315
(birds chirping)

03:04.315 --> 03:06.587
WHENEVER SOMEONE
ON WISTERIA LANE

03:06.587 --> 03:08.219
BUYS A NEW CAR,

03:08.219 --> 03:11.722
A SIMPLE RITUAL IS PERFORMED.

03:11.722 --> 03:14.365
SO HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY NEW CAR?

03:14.365 --> 03:16.727
IT'S GORGEOUS!
 I AM SO JEALOUS.

03:16.727 --> 03:18.729
I WISH I HAD ONE.

03:18.729 --> 03:20.701
BUT ON THIS DAY,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.703
ONE OF THE OWNER'S FRIENDS

03:22.703 --> 03:24.875
REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE RITUAL.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.508
AND EVEN MORE SURPRISINGLY,

03:27.508 --> 03:30.441
THE OWNER
OF THE CAR IN QUESTION

03:30.441 --> 03:31.912
DIDN'T SEEM TO NOTICE.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.585
LOOK, THERE'S EVEN
A REFRIGERATOR.

03:34.585 --> 03:37.348
THE LEXUS DEALER SAID
THERE'S JUST ENOUGH ROOM

03:37.348 --> 03:39.750
FOR A SPLIT OF CHAMPAGNE
AND TWO CHILLED GLASSES.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.392
OOH.
 AHH.

03:41.392 --> 03:43.223
(Edie) MMM!
 (shuts car door)

03:43.223 --> 03:45.556
AND THE BEST THING IS,
IT'S A HYBRID

03:45.556 --> 03:48.559
SO YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT.
LET ME SHOW YOU.

03:48.559 --> 03:51.262
ACTUALLY,
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

03:51.262 --> 03:53.264
BUT CONGRATULATIONS, BREE.
IT'S A BEAUTY.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.612
WAS IT JUST ME,
OR WAS THAT A LITTLE ABRUPT?

04:01.612 --> 04:03.614
EH, DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

04:03.614 --> 04:05.646
I THINK SHE'S GOT
OTHER THINGS ON HER MIND.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.818
OH, DEAR. IS SOMETHING WRONG?

04:07.818 --> 04:10.381
WELL...

04:10.381 --> 04:13.624
APPARENTLY, SHE AND TOM
ARE HAVING FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

04:13.624 --> 04:15.986
THEY JUST HAD TO SELL
TOM'S CAR.

04:15.986 --> 04:18.988
AND YOU KNOW, I SAW HER
AT THE RECYCLING CENTER.

04:18.988 --> 04:21.362
SHE WAS TURNING
HER CANS IN FOR MONEY.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.863
OHH.
 (gasps) YIKES.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.865
THAT'S, LIKE,
A HALF A STEP AWAY

04:24.865 --> 04:26.867
FROM SELLING YOUR EGGS
ON THE INTERNET.
 OH.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.000
AND HERE I AM, RUBBING
MY FABULOUS NEW CAR IN HER FACE.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.042
I FEEL AWFUL.

04:32.042 --> 04:34.545
OH, DON'T.
HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN?

04:34.545 --> 04:37.648
THANK GOD I DIDN'T SHOW HER
HOW THE CAR PARKS ITSELF.

04:37.648 --> 04:38.979
(sighs)

04:38.979 --> 04:41.312
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
SHOW US, RIGHT?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.956
WELL, IT IS PRETTY AMAZING!

04:52.022 --> 04:54.865
WELL, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MRS. MAYER.

04:54.865 --> 04:57.868
THANK YOU FOR AGREEING
TO SEE US, MR. HOBSON.
 (kicking continues)

04:57.868 --> 05:00.431
RUNNING A SCHOOL LIKE OAKRIDGE

05:00.431 --> 05:03.404
MUSTN'T LEAVE YOU WITH MUCH...

05:03.404 --> 05:05.706
FREE TIME.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.578
HAPPY TO OBLIGE.

05:07.578 --> 05:11.041
SO I HEARD
THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE

05:11.041 --> 05:14.885
THAT THERE MIGHT BE
AN OPENING FOR ANOTHER STUDENT?

05:14.885 --> 05:18.719
I ASSUME YOU'RE REFERRING TO
THE HENDERSON BOY'S EXPULSION?

05:18.719 --> 05:20.951
YEAH.
HE BIT HIS TEACHER, HUH?

05:20.951 --> 05:22.453
THEY HAD THAT PROBLEM

05:22.453 --> 05:25.325
WITH THEIR OLDER BOY,
TOBY.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.958
IT'S A FAMILY OF BITERS.

05:29.630 --> 05:33.003
WELL, THE WHOLE SITUATION
WAS INCREDIBLY UNFORTUNATE.

05:33.003 --> 05:34.535
BUT...

05:34.535 --> 05:36.006
MM.

05:36.006 --> 05:38.939
WE CAN'T TOLERATE
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.942
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT WITH M.J.

05:41.942 --> 05:45.376
(chuckles)
HE'S SO WELL-BEHAVED.

05:45.376 --> 05:48.719
LOOK, I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU WANT YOUR SON AT OAKRIDGE.

05:48.719 --> 05:51.882
YOU'VE CALLED US EVERY WEEK
FOR THE PAST FIVE MONTHS.

05:51.882 --> 05:54.885
I'VE BEEN TOO PUSHY. OH,
PLEASE DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON M.J.

05:54.885 --> 05:57.728
HE IS SUCH A BRIGHT KID.
SAY SOMETHING IN SPANISH.

05:57.728 --> 05:59.089
I'M BORED.

05:59.089 --> 06:01.632
BE BORED IN SPANISH.

06:01.632 --> 06:04.034
MRS. MAYER, YOU CAN RELAX.

06:04.034 --> 06:07.037
WE WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE M.J. JOIN US HERE.

06:07.037 --> 06:08.869
SERIOUSLY?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.140
YES.

06:10.140 --> 06:13.003
AS A MATTER OF FACT, HIS NAME
WAS FIRST ON OUR WAITING LIST.

06:13.003 --> 06:14.645
FANTASTIC!

06:14.645 --> 06:15.806
OH!

06:15.806 --> 06:17.808
HERE'S A SCHEDULE FOR YOU.

06:17.808 --> 06:20.981
HERE ARE SOME INSURANCE FORMS
YOU NEED TO FILL OUT.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.613
AND HERE'S THE TUITION.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.815
AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT'S GONE UP A TAD.

06:24.815 --> 06:26.016
OH.

06:26.016 --> 06:28.659
YEAH. THAT'S QUITE A TAD.

06:28.659 --> 06:30.961
BUT WE'RE STARTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR,

06:30.961 --> 06:32.993
SO WE'D ONLY PAY HALF,
RIGHT?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.666
YES. WE'VE ALREADY PRORATED IT.
THAT IS HALF.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.032
FANTASTIC.

06:42.032 --> 06:43.634
(shaking continues)

06:48.038 --> 06:52.012
HEY, I JUST THOUGHT OF A WAY

06:52.012 --> 06:54.515
FOR US TO CELEBRATE
OUR ANNIVERSARY NEXT WEEK.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.548
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT DINNER AT THE PALM?

06:57.548 --> 06:59.019
THE PALM?

06:59.019 --> 07:00.621
AS IN,

07:00.621 --> 07:03.594
"THEY DON'T EVEN SHOW THE PRICES
ON THE MENU" THE PALM?

07:03.594 --> 07:06.727
HONEY, WE'RE STILL PAYING OFF
CREDIT CARD DEBT.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.960
NOT ANYMORE. THE DEAL CLOSED.
I GOT THE BONUS.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.062
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!

07:12.062 --> 07:14.605
(laughs)
 THAT'S GREAT!

07:14.605 --> 07:16.607
(gasps) OH, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS

07:16.607 --> 07:18.669
WHEN YOU WERE BEGGING
FOR SEX THIS MORNING?

07:18.669 --> 07:21.111
YOU WOULD'VE CLOSED
 THAT DEAL, TOO.
 (laugh) OH!

07:21.111 --> 07:24.114
OH. WE'RE RICH AGAIN!
HALLELUJAH!
 WELL, WE ARE NOT

07:24.114 --> 07:26.116
"LIGHTING CIGARS
WITH $5 BILLS" RICH,

07:26.116 --> 07:28.148
BUT WE ARE HEADED
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.120
OH! HONEY, WE'RE GONNA
BE US AGAIN--

07:30.120 --> 07:32.583
THE OLD CARLOS AND GABY.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.725
(chuckles)
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:34.725 --> 07:36.727
I'M GONNA WEAR MY DRESS
FROM THE NIGHT YOU PROPOSED.

07:36.727 --> 07:39.730
(scoffs)
YOU STILL FIT IN THAT?

07:39.730 --> 07:42.963
(singsongy) WE'RE RICH AGAIN!
HALLELUJAH!

07:42.963 --> 07:46.136
HAVE YOU NOT NOTICED
ME WORKING MY BUTT OFF?

07:46.136 --> 07:49.770
I'M ALMOST BACK TO THE WEIGHT
I WAS WHEN WE GOT MARRIED!

07:49.770 --> 07:52.102
(sighs)
ALL I MEANT WAS...

07:52.102 --> 07:54.104
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
AN OLD DRESS.

07:54.104 --> 07:56.106
I WILL BUY YOU A NEW ONE.

07:56.106 --> 07:59.109
NO, NO. THIS'LL BE WAY MORE
ROMANTIC. (chuckles)

07:59.109 --> 08:04.084
I'M ONE GOOD COLONIC AWAY
FROM BEING THE OLD ME!

08:04.084 --> 08:06.857
I'LL CALL THE RESTAURANT.

08:06.857 --> 08:10.060
THEY CAN WRITE THAT ON THE CAKE.

08:14.124 --> 08:17.227
SORRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVED THAT CAR.

08:17.227 --> 08:20.631
THIS IS ALL I HAVE
TO REMEMBER HER BY.

08:24.074 --> 08:26.577
I CALLED HER "FOXY."
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

08:26.577 --> 08:27.808
NO.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.509
(Dave) TOM.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.682
I JUST HEARD.
YOU SOLD THE CAR?

08:31.682 --> 08:33.082
YEAH. (sighs)

08:33.082 --> 08:36.587
WELL, WE NEEDED THE MONEY.
THE RESTAURANT IS DYING.

08:36.587 --> 08:38.589
APPARENTLY, PEOPLE DON'T WANNA
BUY THEIR PIZZA

08:38.589 --> 08:42.653
FROM PARENTS
OF AN ALLEGED ARSONIST.
 YEAH,
BUT PORTER DIDN'T DO IT.

08:42.653 --> 08:46.256
WELL, MAYBE PEOPLE STILL
THINK THAT HE'S GUILTY,

08:46.256 --> 08:48.258
OR MAYBE IT'S THE ECONOMY.

08:48.258 --> 08:50.530
OR MAYBE IT'S BOTH.
I DON'T KNOW.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.533
ALL I KNOW IS,
I AM DRIVING A "DAD CAR"

08:53.533 --> 08:56.737
WHILE SOME OTHER GUY
IS OUT ROLLING WITH FOXY.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.169
OH, BUDDY. I'M SO SORRY.

09:03.173 --> 09:06.116
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO.

09:06.116 --> 09:07.978
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

09:07.978 --> 09:11.922
BUT IF WE CAN HELP IN ANY WAY,
UM, LET US KNOW.

09:11.922 --> 09:13.924
OKAY?
 THANKS.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.293
OKAY, WHAT JUST HAPPENED
BACK THERE?

09:23.293 --> 09:25.095
NOTHING.

09:25.095 --> 09:27.598
(laughs) OH, YEAH.
LIKE THAT'S GONNA WORK.

09:27.598 --> 09:30.100
WHY CAN'T YOU EVER REMEMBER
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH?

09:30.100 --> 09:33.103
BOB? BOB? BOB? BOB--
I CAN KEEP THIS UP ALL DAY.

09:33.103 --> 09:34.805
BOB? B--
 FINE.

09:34.805 --> 09:37.107
THE DAY THE CASE AGAINST PORTER
WAS DISMISSED,

09:37.107 --> 09:40.611
I WAS GOING OVER THE DISCOVERY
MATERIALS THAT THE D.A. SENT ME.

09:40.611 --> 09:42.112
OKAY? SO?

09:42.112 --> 09:45.115
THE WITNESS WHO PUT PORTER
IN THE STORAGE ROOM AT THE CLUB,

09:45.115 --> 09:48.719
THE ONLY ONE LINKING HIM
DIRECTLY TO THE ARSON--

09:48.719 --> 09:51.121
TOM'S HELPFUL BUDDY THERE--
DAVE WILLIAMS.

09:51.121 --> 09:53.293
WHAT?
 YEAH.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.295
PORTER WASN'T EVEN
IN THE BUILDING.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.597
WHAT THE HELL
IS DAVE DOING?

09:57.597 --> 10:00.831
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE HAVE
TO TELL TOM AND LYNETTE.
 NO, THAT'LL JUST GET UGLY.

10:00.831 --> 10:02.773
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

10:02.773 --> 10:04.775
LEE, THE CHARGES
HAVE BEEN DROPPED.

10:04.775 --> 10:07.207
IT'S NO LONGER OUR BUSINESS.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.910
BESIDES, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT DAVE GUY

10:09.910 --> 10:11.742
THAT SCARES ME.

10:14.685 --> 10:17.047
(both speaking inaudibly)

10:28.198 --> 10:29.960
(grunts) OH!

10:29.960 --> 10:31.962
OH, I DON'T GET IT!

10:31.962 --> 10:34.965
I'M ONLY A FEW POUNDS AWAY
FROM MY RUNWAY WEIGHT.

10:34.965 --> 10:37.968
YOU WANT ME TO LET IT OUT?
 (sighs)
THAT WOULD BE CHEATING.

10:37.968 --> 10:39.970
I'M GONNA TRY
TO GO PEE AGAIN.

10:39.970 --> 10:43.013
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'VE HAD TWO CHILDREN.

10:43.013 --> 10:45.846
THE WEIGHT REDISTRIBUTES.
GIVE IN TO IT! I DID.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.848
JEAN, YOU DIDN'T JUST
GIVE IN TO IT.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.020
YOU SLAPPED A PIECE OF CHEESE
ON IT.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.322
YEAH, I SAID IT.
NOW JUST FIX THE HEM.

10:52.322 --> 10:55.325
AND THIS TIME, TRY NOT
TO LEAVE THE EDGES FRAYED.

10:55.325 --> 10:58.188
(sighs)

10:58.188 --> 11:00.030
OOH! OOH!

11:01.792 --> 11:03.894
HEY, EDIE! WAIT UP!

11:07.237 --> 11:09.239
NOW DON'T FORGET,
THE CLASP IS BROKEN.

11:09.239 --> 11:11.071
OH, I'LL REPLACE IT.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.073
IT MAY NOT MATCH EXACTLY.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.405
BUT, UM, YOUR HAIR
WILL COVER IT.

11:15.405 --> 11:18.749
JEAN, CARLOS IS TAKING ME TO
THE PALM, NOT OUT FOR HOAGIES.

11:18.749 --> 11:20.280
MAKE IT PERFECT.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.013
HUH. I SEE JEAN IS BACK.

11:23.013 --> 11:25.185
AH, YEAH. TIMES ARE GOOD.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.817
NOT FOR HER.

11:26.817 --> 11:28.719
HER, MRS. McCLUSKEY
SAID SOMETHING

11:28.719 --> 11:30.721
ABOUT YOU LOSING 5 POUNDS
IN ONE DAY.

11:30.721 --> 11:32.222
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

11:32.222 --> 11:34.995
I GOT DRUNK ON BOURBON
AND THREW UP ALL OVER HER LAWN.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.768
NO, NOT THAT STORY.
SOMETHING ABOUT A BOOT CAMP.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.429
OH, YEAH. JUST STARTED.

11:39.429 --> 11:41.902
VERY MILITARY, VERY INTENSE.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.234
THAT'S PERFECT. I'M TRYING
TO FIT IN AN OLD DRESS.

11:44.234 --> 11:48.708
I NEED INTENSE.
 FORGET IT. YOU CAN'T GET IN
WITHOUT A RECOMMENDATION,

11:48.708 --> 11:51.211
AND I'M NOT
RECOMMENDING YOU.
 WHY NOT?

11:51.211 --> 11:54.184
BECAUSE YOU'D EMBARRASS ME.
THIS IS REAL EXERCISE.

11:54.184 --> 11:57.447
IT'S NOT THE LOTUS POSITION
FOLLOWED BY A MOCHA LATTE.

11:57.447 --> 12:02.052
OH, YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
I'M GONNA LOOK BETTER THAN YOU!

12:03.323 --> 12:06.496
6:00 A.M., THE PARK.
PREPARE TO DIE.

12:08.098 --> 12:11.401
JEEZ. THIS IS THE TUITION?

12:11.401 --> 12:14.104
WE'RE GONNA BLOW
HIS COLLEGE FUND ON FIRST GRADE.

12:14.104 --> 12:17.507
I KNOW, I KNOW. WE MAY HAVE
TO GIVE UP A FEW LUXURIES.

12:17.507 --> 12:19.840
YEAH, LIKE FOOD AND HEAT.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.412
OKAY, YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS
THEY'RE HAVING AT HIS SCHOOL.

12:22.412 --> 12:24.414
AND NOW WITH ALL
THE BUDGET CUTBACKS...

12:24.414 --> 12:26.416
I MEAN, THIS PLACE
IS FABULOUS.

12:26.416 --> 12:29.149
YEAH, I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT.
I'D KILL TO SEND HIM THERE.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.282
BUT I JUST CAN'T SWING IT.
 WELL, WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

12:32.282 --> 12:33.984
MY EDITOR JUST QUIT,

12:33.984 --> 12:37.828
AND MY BOOKS ARE NOT EXACTLY
FLYING OFF THE SHELVES.

12:37.828 --> 12:40.490
COULD YOU PICK UP
SOME EXTRA SHIFTS?
 OH, YEAH, I WILL...

12:40.490 --> 12:44.194
(papers hit table)
 AS SOON AS THEY CREATE
A 30-HOUR DAY.

12:44.194 --> 12:48.198
I'M WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK.
 WHAT ABOUT THAT BIG JOB YOU JUST
DID FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS?

12:48.198 --> 12:50.500
WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THAT MONEY?

12:50.500 --> 12:53.103
SUSAN,
WE'RE NOT MARRIED ANYMORE.

12:53.103 --> 12:56.106
AND WHAT I DO WITH MY MONEY
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

12:56.106 --> 12:58.778
YEAH, WELL, IF WE WERE
STILL MARRIED, YOU'D...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.150
(door opens and closes)

13:00.150 --> 13:04.014
PROBABLY WOULD'VE WAITED
UNTIL I FINISHED MY SENTENCE.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.217
WHAT'S THIS?

13:07.217 --> 13:08.488
A CHECK.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.892
I UNDERSTAND YOU AND TOM ARE
GOING THROUGH SOME ROUGH TIMES.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.794
NO. OH!

13:14.794 --> 13:17.097
THANK YOU,
BUT I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.

13:18.999 --> 13:23.573
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I'M NOT ACCEPTING.

13:23.573 --> 13:26.276
$20,000?!

13:26.276 --> 13:29.980
HOW MANY COOKBOOKS
ARE YOU SELLING, WOMAN?
 WE JUST WENT TO
A SECOND PRINTING,

13:29.980 --> 13:32.542
AND NOW THEY'RE TALKING
A 3-BOOK DEAL.
 (gasps)

13:32.542 --> 13:34.514
SO SERIOUSLY, I AM NOT
GONNA MISS THAT MONEY.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.046
WOW!

13:36.046 --> 13:37.417
THAT MUST BE NICE.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.990
BUT... I CAN'T ACCEPT IT.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.353
WHY NOT?
WHAT'S THE POINT OF SUCCESS

13:43.353 --> 13:45.825
IF YOU CAN'T SHARE IT
WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE?

13:45.825 --> 13:48.959
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY YOU BACK,

13:48.959 --> 13:52.302
AND THEN YOU STOP LOVING THEM.
 THEN IT'S NOT A LOAN,
IT'S A GIFT.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.036
DON'T YOU HAVE A BIRTHDAY
COMING UP?

13:56.036 --> 13:59.269
(laughs) AND SO DO YOU.

13:59.269 --> 14:01.341
AND I'M GONNA FEEL
REAL CRAPPY

14:01.341 --> 14:03.473
WHEN YOU UNWRAP
YOUR LAVENDER BATH BEADS.

14:03.473 --> 14:05.175
COME ON, LYNETTE.

14:05.175 --> 14:08.148
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS MONEY
WON'T TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF.

14:08.148 --> 14:11.151
IT WOULD.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.955
BUT I CAN'T. I WOULDN'T WANT IT
TO AFFECT OUR FRIENDSHIP.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.126
(scoffs)

14:16.126 --> 14:17.457
(whispers) OKAY.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.989
ALTHOUGH...

14:20.290 --> 14:22.292
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO OWN

14:22.292 --> 14:25.165
A PIECE OF
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT?
 WHAT?

14:25.165 --> 14:27.167
IT WOULDN'T BE A LOAN
OR A GIFT.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.139
IT WOULD BE... AN INVESTMENT

14:29.139 --> 14:33.303
THAT WOULD BUY YOU, SAY...
15% OF SCAVO'S.

14:33.303 --> 14:35.175
OH! WELL,
THAT'S AN INTRIGUING OFFER.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.178
IF WE DO WELL,
YOU GET A CUT OF THE PROFITS.

14:38.178 --> 14:42.552
IF WE GO BELLY-UP, WE LIQUIDATE,
AND YOU GET THE FIRST $20,000.

14:42.552 --> 14:46.016
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
MY FAMILY MOVES IN WITH YOU.

14:46.016 --> 14:48.959
SO... DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

14:48.959 --> 14:51.661
WE MOST CERTAINLY DO...

14:51.661 --> 14:53.093
PARTNER.

14:55.165 --> 14:57.027
SOME PEOPLE
THINK IT'S STRANGE

14:57.027 --> 14:59.029
I HAVE A CONTRACT
FOR MY EXERCISE CLASS.

14:59.029 --> 15:01.301
BUT I WANT PEOPLE
TO UNDERSTAND

15:01.301 --> 15:04.504
THE COMMITMENT I EXPECT FROM
THEM. I FOUND IN THE PAST--
 HERE YOU GO.

15:04.504 --> 15:08.078
ALL SIGNED.
 YOU DIDN'T EVEN READ IT.

15:08.078 --> 15:10.040
OH, NO NEED.
I'M UP FOR ANYTHING.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.042
ALTHOUGH I DID
JUST GET A MANICURE,

15:12.042 --> 15:14.584
SO NOTHING THAT MIGHT
CHIP A NAIL.

15:14.584 --> 15:16.286
MRS. SOLIS...

15:16.286 --> 15:19.289
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I LEARN
IN THE ISRAELI ARMY.

15:19.289 --> 15:22.552
A GROUP WITHOUT COMMITMENT
IS A GROUP THAT WILL FAIL.

15:22.552 --> 15:25.155
THE WOMEN IN MY MORNING CLASS
ARE COMMITTED.

15:25.155 --> 15:27.157
I AM STARTING TO THINK

15:27.157 --> 15:29.559
THAT YOU ARE NOT
TOUGH ENOUGH.

15:29.559 --> 15:31.301
NOT TOUGH ENOUGH?

15:31.301 --> 15:34.965
(scoffs) LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MR. IRAQI ARMY GUY.

15:34.965 --> 15:36.606
ISRAELI.
 WHATEVER.

15:36.606 --> 15:39.569
I USED TO BE A MODEL,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WAR IS

15:39.569 --> 15:41.571
UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN
IN A DRESSING ROOM

15:41.571 --> 15:44.514
WITH A BUNCH OF SIZE ZEROES
REACHING FOR THE LAST RICE CAKE.

15:44.514 --> 15:47.217
I AM PLENTY TOUGH.
 I'M NOT SO SURE.

15:47.217 --> 15:50.050
HEY, I KNOW SOME OF THOSE WOMEN
IN YOUR EXERCISE CLASS.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.253
THE MOST EXERCISE THEY EVER GET
IS CUTTING A PIECE OF CAKE.
 THAT'S A LAP!

15:53.253 --> 15:55.085
EXCUSE ME?
 IN THE CONTRACT.

15:55.085 --> 15:57.387
THERE ARE CERTAIN WORDS
I DO NOT TOLERATE--

15:57.387 --> 16:00.290
"CAKE," "TIRED,"

16:00.290 --> 16:02.732
"CAN'T," "DOUGHNUT."

16:02.732 --> 16:06.036
IF I HEAR THEM,
YOU OWE ME A LAP.

16:06.036 --> 16:09.269
(scoffs) IT'S AN EXERCISE CLASS.
WHY WOULD ANYONE SAY "DOUGHNUT"?

16:09.269 --> 16:12.142
THAT'S ANOTHER LAP!

16:12.142 --> 16:15.305
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD
GIVE THIS A LITTLE GANDER.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.318
COME ON, LADIES!

16:28.318 --> 16:30.320
WHEN I WAS
IN THE SPECIAL FORCES,

16:30.320 --> 16:33.323
WE WOULD DO SIT-UPS
IN 115-DEGREE WEATHER.

16:33.323 --> 16:35.695
I STILL HAVE SAND IN MY ASS.

16:35.695 --> 16:38.528
YOU PEOPLE ARE WEAK!
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

16:38.528 --> 16:41.331
(wheezes and coughs)

16:41.331 --> 16:43.333
(lowered voice)
GABY, KNOCK IT OFF.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.475
YOU'RE GONNA GET US ALL
IN TROUBLE. (exhales)

16:45.475 --> 16:47.137
IT'S HARD.

16:47.137 --> 16:50.009
OF COURSE IT IS. THAT'S WHY
IT'S CALLED BOOT CAMP.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.712
JUST HANG IN THERE, GABY.
WE ALL WENT THROUGH IT.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.485
SHUT UP, MONA.
I'M PUKING AIR.

16:55.485 --> 16:56.786
(groans)

16:56.786 --> 16:59.049
HE'S COMING. GET CRUNCHING.

17:01.091 --> 17:03.423
HEY! DID I HEAR TALKING?

17:03.423 --> 17:06.226
SORRY, SIR!
SHE GOT A LITTLE NAUSEOUS.

17:08.058 --> 17:10.230
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.232
YOU RETCH ON YOUR OWN TIME.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.763
(panting)
OKAY. WE NEED TO TALK.

17:14.763 --> 17:17.036
(lowered voice) GABY, NO.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.138
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
GET YOUR BUTT BACK DOWN!

17:19.138 --> 17:21.540
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. TIME-OUT.
 TIME-OUT?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.574
LOOK, I APPRECIATE THIS
WHOLE MILITARY COMMANDO ACT,

17:24.574 --> 17:29.119
BUT I'M NEW AT THIS,
AND FRANKLY, THIS IS A BIT MUCH.
 A BIT MUCH?

17:29.119 --> 17:31.681
YEAH. ARE WE GONNA GET
A BREAK SOON?

17:31.681 --> 17:34.784
OH. OH, WE WANT A BREAK.

17:34.784 --> 17:38.628
LIKE, MAYBE SOME COFFEE,
SOME PASTRY?

17:38.628 --> 17:41.261
OH, THAT SOUNDS SO YUMMY.
 (chuckles)

17:41.261 --> 17:45.064
YOU GOT ANY?
 NO, I DON'T GOT ANY! NOW GET
DOWN OR I'M GONNA PUT YOU DOWN!

17:45.064 --> 17:49.199
I SAID TIME-OUT!
 THERE IS NO TIME-OUT! YOU SIGNED
A CONTRACT! NOW GET DOWN!

17:49.199 --> 17:52.242
DON'T TAKE THAT TONE WITH ME.
I AM PAYING.
 DO IT! DO IT!

17:52.242 --> 17:55.205
AAH!
 DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
DO IT! DO IT!

17:55.205 --> 17:57.307
WHO BROUGHT HER HERE?

17:57.307 --> 17:59.309
THAT WOULD BE ME!
(exhales)

17:59.309 --> 18:01.481
SORRY, SIR! (exhales)

18:01.481 --> 18:03.283
BECAUSE OF EDIE,

18:03.283 --> 18:07.357
OUR 2-MILE RUN IS NOW 4 MILES!

18:07.357 --> 18:08.388
(women groan)

18:08.388 --> 18:10.260
(panting)

18:17.267 --> 18:18.828
(Katherine laughs)

18:18.828 --> 18:22.672
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THOSE. WOW!
 HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:22.672 --> 18:25.835
OH, SUSAN,
YOU GOTTA CHECK THESE OUT.

18:25.835 --> 18:28.208
OH, PLEASE DON'T MAKE A FUSS.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.210
THEY'RE MAGNIFICENT.
SUSAN, LOOK AT 'EM.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.713
UH, WHAT AM I
LOOKING AT EXACTLY?
 THE PEARLS.

18:33.713 --> 18:37.387
OH, THOSE. (chuckles)
OH, THEY'RE STUNNING.

18:37.387 --> 18:39.149
OH.
 THANK YOU.

18:39.149 --> 18:42.692
WELL, I HAVE A BIG BAR MITZVAH
TO PREP. SEE YA.

18:42.692 --> 18:44.254
(chuckles)

18:44.254 --> 18:46.326
OH. MM. SHE'S SO LUCKY.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.328
MIKE IS SUCH A GREAT GUY.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.531
WHAT? MIKE BOUGHT THOSE?
HE BOUGHT HER PEARLS?

18:51.531 --> 18:54.534
HE'S A KEEPER.

18:54.534 --> 18:58.308
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DIDN'T KEEP HIM, DID YOU?

18:58.308 --> 19:00.310
MM.

19:00.310 --> 19:01.441
SU--

19:04.314 --> 19:05.915
(door opens)

19:05.915 --> 19:09.249
HI.
 LYNETTE, HI. OH, I WISH
I HAD TIME FOR A CHAT,

19:09.249 --> 19:11.221
BUT I'M ON MY WAY
TO A MEETING.

19:11.221 --> 19:14.224
I MIGHT DESIGN MY OWN LINE
OF BAKEWARE. CAN YOU IMAGINE?

19:14.224 --> 19:16.386
THIS WILL JUST TAKE A SEC.
 OKAY.

19:16.386 --> 19:18.388
TOM AND I ARE SO GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR INVESTMENT

19:18.388 --> 19:21.391
THAT WE WANT TO DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR YOU.
 OH, THAT SOUNDS LOVELY.

19:21.391 --> 19:23.393
WE'D LIKE TO SHUT SCAVO'S DOWN
FOR THE NIGHT

19:23.393 --> 19:26.896
AND THROW A PARTY IN YOUR HONOR.
JUST FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

19:26.896 --> 19:29.869
WE'D TOAST YOUR SUCCESS
AND HAVE A NIGHT OF FUN,

19:29.869 --> 19:34.244
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
 OH, THAT SOUNDS NICE.
CAN WE WALK AND TALK?

19:34.244 --> 19:37.247
YEAH, YEAH.
 YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE
EVEN BETTER?

19:37.247 --> 19:39.249
MY PUBLISHER
HAS BEEN BEGGING ME

19:39.249 --> 19:41.751
TO DO A LOCAL LAUNCH
FOR MY BOOK.
 HMM.

19:41.751 --> 19:43.753
I COULD DO A SIGNING
AT YOUR RESTAURANT

19:43.753 --> 19:45.955
AND FINALLY FILL THE PLACE.

19:45.955 --> 19:49.659
WOULD YOU HOLD THAT
FOR A MOMENT?
 OH. WELL, WE'VE FILLED THE PLACE
MANY TIMES, BUT IT'S YOUR PARTY.

19:49.659 --> 19:52.662
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
 OH, YOU CAN JUST PUT THAT
ON A HANGER IN THE BACK.

19:52.662 --> 19:54.964
WHAT I WANT IS TO MAKE THIS
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

19:54.964 --> 19:58.598
WE CAN TURN ONE OF YOUR
DISMAL THURSDAY NIGHT SEATINGS

19:58.598 --> 20:01.371
INTO A REAL EVENT.

20:01.371 --> 20:03.433
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.375
WELL, DON'T THANK ME.
IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.976
(chuckles) RIGHT.

20:08.378 --> 20:10.410
(engine starts)

20:10.410 --> 20:12.342
(sighs)

20:12.342 --> 20:15.785
GLAD I THOUGHT OF IT.

20:15.785 --> 20:20.590
SUSAN MAYER KNEW SHE COULDN'T
ALWAYS GIVE HER SON

20:20.590 --> 20:23.293
EVERYTHING
SHE WOULD'VE LIKED...

20:23.293 --> 20:25.425
(sighs)

20:25.425 --> 20:27.697
YET WHEN SHE SAW
HER CHILD'S TUITION

20:27.697 --> 20:30.400
AROUND
KATHERINE MAYFAIR'S NECK,

20:30.400 --> 20:34.304
SHE FELT SOMETHING
HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM HIM.

20:34.304 --> 20:38.768
AND IT DIDN'T TAKE HER LONG
TO DECIDE...

20:38.768 --> 20:43.273
HOW SHE WAS
GOING TO GET IT BACK.

20:43.273 --> 20:45.675
(cell phone rings)

20:45.675 --> 20:46.776
(ring)

20:46.776 --> 20:48.348
(beep)

20:48.348 --> 20:50.720
SUSAN, HI.
 Hi. You at home?

20:50.720 --> 20:53.723
UH, YEAH. I'M JUST ABOUT TO JUMP
IN THE SHOWER. WHAT'S UP?

20:53.723 --> 20:56.726
I'm going crazy 'cause I think
I left my front door unlocked.

20:56.726 --> 21:00.360
Could you run and check?
I'll stay on the line.

21:02.292 --> 21:05.465
NO, NO. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.467
THE ONE DAY I DON'T LOCK UP,

21:07.467 --> 21:10.670
I ALWAYS THINK THAT'S THE DAY
SOMEBODY'S GONNA BREAK IN.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.842
EXACTLY.

21:15.905 --> 21:19.979
AND SO EVEN THOUGH I WAS ALREADY
HALFWAY TO THE AIRPORT,

21:19.979 --> 21:22.382
I TURNED AROUND
AND I CAME HOME,

21:22.382 --> 21:25.485
AND, YEP, I HAD LEFT
THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL ON.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.658
SO EVER SINCE THEN,
I ALWAYS CHECK.

21:28.658 --> 21:31.361
Oh, I'm the same way.
Anyway, you can relax.

21:31.361 --> 21:34.063
The front door's
all locked up.
 OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:34.063 --> 21:36.366
I'M ACTUALLY STILL WORRIED
ABOUT THE SIDE DOOR.

21:36.366 --> 21:39.369
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
CHECK THAT, TOO?
 Already did. You're good.

21:39.369 --> 21:43.473
(front door closes)
 Well, I'm gonna take that shower
now. See ya later, hon.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.006
(sighs)

21:54.544 --> 21:57.547
(humming)

22:09.729 --> 22:11.100
(faucet squeaks)

22:11.100 --> 22:14.364
(shower running)

22:14.364 --> 22:16.035
(grunts)

22:18.638 --> 22:20.740
(Katherine) MIKE, IS THAT YOU?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.612
(whispers) OH. OH.

22:22.612 --> 22:24.614
(grunts)

22:24.614 --> 22:26.476
(faucet shuts off)

22:26.476 --> 22:28.347
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.649
(gasps)

22:29.649 --> 22:30.920
SUSAN?

22:30.920 --> 22:32.482
HI.

22:32.482 --> 22:34.784
(gasps)

22:34.784 --> 22:36.926
HEY!

22:40.990 --> 22:42.492
SUSAN MAYER!

22:42.492 --> 22:47.467
FOR GOD SAKE,
GIVE ME BACK MY PEARLS!

22:47.467 --> 22:49.899
PEARLS OR TOWEL--
YOU DECIDE.

22:49.899 --> 22:52.902
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.
 I HAVE BEEN NAKED
ON THIS STREET.

22:52.902 --> 22:56.776
IT WOULD BE NICE TO TAKE
THE HEAT OFF THAT STORY.
 HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

22:56.776 --> 22:59.949
MIKE SAID HE CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY
FOR M.J.'s PRIVATE SCHOOL.

22:59.949 --> 23:01.711
NOW I KNOW WHY.

23:01.711 --> 23:03.783
HE WANTS TO SEE
HIS GIRLFRIEND WEARING PEARLS

23:03.783 --> 23:05.114
WHEN SHE FLASHES HIM.

23:05.114 --> 23:08.418
WHAT? HE WOULDN'T PAY
FOR M.J.'s SCHOOL?

23:08.418 --> 23:10.490
NO. SO I WAS
GOING TO TAKE THESE

23:10.490 --> 23:12.492
AND SELL THEM
TO TRY TO PAY FOR IT,

23:12.492 --> 23:15.465
AND, YES, NOW THAT
I'M SAYING IT OUT LOUD,

23:15.465 --> 23:19.469
I HEAR HOW STUPID
THAT SOUNDS.
 I CAN'T BELIEVE
MIKE WOULD DO THAT.

23:19.469 --> 23:21.431
WELL, HE DID.
 (bicycle approaches, thud)

23:21.431 --> 23:23.933
HEY, MRS. MAYFAIR.

23:23.933 --> 23:26.135
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

23:30.710 --> 23:33.182
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
DISCUSS THIS LATER.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.532
(shifts gears,
removes keys from ignition)

23:54.433 --> 23:58.107
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

24:00.510 --> 24:03.673
SO IS THIS A "WELCOME HOME,
WE MISSED YOU" KIND OF THING

24:03.673 --> 24:05.475
OR...

24:06.846 --> 24:08.848
OH.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.120
DAMN RIGHT, "OH."
WHAT HAPPENED TO "I'M BROKE

24:11.120 --> 24:14.624
AND CAN'T AFFORD TO SEND M.J.
TO PRIVATE SCHOOL"?
 DON'T GET ME WRONG, MIKE.

24:14.624 --> 24:17.126
IT WAS
A WONDERFULLY GENEROUS PRESENT.

24:17.126 --> 24:20.229
BUT YOU CAN'T GO AROUND
BLOWING YOUR KID'S MONEY

24:20.229 --> 24:22.231
ON JEWELRY FOR YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

24:22.231 --> 24:25.464
WHAT DID THESE COST YOU?
$4,000, $5,000?

24:25.464 --> 24:29.068
$129.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.700
WHAT?

24:30.700 --> 24:32.772
THEY'RE FAKE, OKAY?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.974
AND I KNEW HOW BADLY
YOU WANTED PEARLS,

24:34.974 --> 24:37.677
AND I COULDN'T AFFORD
REAL ONES.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.479
AND THE SALESMAN SWORE
YOU'D NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE,

24:40.479 --> 24:41.981
AND SHE DIDN'T.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.482
WELL...

24:43.482 --> 24:48.888
AT LEAST YOU WON'T FEEL BAD
IF YOU EVER LOSE THEM.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.160
(sighs)

24:51.160 --> 24:54.163
I JUST WANTED TO GET YOU
A REALLY NICE GIFT,

24:54.163 --> 24:55.865
AND I DON'T KNOW.

24:55.865 --> 24:57.897
I-I GUESS I WAS EMBARRASSED
WHEN I COULDN'T.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.269
MIKE, DON'T EVER FEEL

25:00.269 --> 25:03.633
LIKE YOU HAVE TO SPEND MONEY
TO IMPRESS ME.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.274
OKAY?

25:05.274 --> 25:07.206
TRUST ME.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.009
I'M ALREADY VERY IMPRESSED.

25:15.044 --> 25:18.988
UGH. OKAY, OKAY. POINT MADE.

25:18.988 --> 25:20.720
MOVE ALONG.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.153
I'LL GO FIX US
SOME DINNER.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.256
HOW DARE YOU.

25:27.256 --> 25:29.829
(scoffs) I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE FAKE.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.831
I MEAN HOW DARE YOU THINK

25:31.831 --> 25:34.604
THAT I WOULD PUT JEWELRY
FOR MY GIRLFRIEND

25:34.604 --> 25:36.666
AHEAD OF MY SON'S EDUCATION.

25:36.666 --> 25:38.668
OKAY, MAYBE I JUMPED
TO CONCLUSIONS,

25:38.668 --> 25:41.240
BUT THIS SCHOOL IS IMPORTANT
FOR M.J.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.243
I FEEL REALLY BAD
THAT WE'RE FALLING SHORT.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.245
SUSAN, I'VE BEEN AT WORK
SINCE 6:00 THIS MORNING,

25:46.245 --> 25:48.247
AND AFTER I INHALE
A 5-MINUTE DINNER,

25:48.247 --> 25:50.249
I'M GOING BACK OUT
TILL MIDNIGHT.

25:50.249 --> 25:53.252
I AM BUSTING MY ASS
TO GIVE OUR SON THE BEST,

25:53.252 --> 25:57.687
SO IF WE'RE FALLING SHORT,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

25:57.687 --> 26:02.291
(door opens and closes)

26:05.034 --> 26:08.898

26:13.242 --> 26:16.345
(man) Where are you?
You're late for training.

26:16.345 --> 26:18.708
OH, YEAH, I QUIT THAT.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.711
There is no quitting.
It's in the contract.

26:21.711 --> 26:25.214
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT UP WITH MY LAWYER.

26:25.214 --> 26:27.717
HERE HE IS.

26:27.717 --> 26:31.290
(snores)

26:31.290 --> 26:34.293
(whistle blows)
 (man) WE ARE NOT LEAVING!

26:34.293 --> 26:36.696
(whistle blows)

26:36.696 --> 26:38.067
OH.

26:38.067 --> 26:40.229
COME ON, LADIES! KEEP GOING!

26:40.229 --> 26:42.301
KEEP IT MOVING!

26:42.301 --> 26:46.035
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

26:46.035 --> 26:48.037
WHEN YOU DON'T COME
TO BOOT CAMP,

26:48.037 --> 26:50.880
BOOT CAMP COMES TO YOU.
FALL IN!

26:50.880 --> 26:55.314
ARE YOU OUT OF MIND?
I HAVE TWO SLEEPING CHILDREN.
 OH, I KNOW.
I'VE SEEN THE CELLULITE.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.648
FALL IN!
 DO IT, GABY.
THERE IS NO QUITTING.

26:58.648 --> 27:00.690
OH, DON'T GET
ALL HOLIER THAN THOU, MONA.

27:00.690 --> 27:04.924
I SAW YOU PULL INTO
THE DOUGHNUT SHACK YESTERDAY.
 DOUGHNUT--THAT'S A LAP!

27:04.924 --> 27:07.396
OH, REALLY?
WELL, TRY THIS ON FOR SIZE.

27:07.396 --> 27:10.629
I'M GOING BACK TO BED,
BECAUSE I'M TIRED.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.402
AND WHEN I WAKE UP,
MAYBE I'LL HAVE SOME CAKE,

27:13.402 --> 27:16.305
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

27:16.305 --> 27:17.967

27:24.914 --> 27:26.716
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

27:26.716 --> 27:28.718
IF YOU DON'T GET OUT THERE,

27:28.718 --> 27:30.850
HE IS GONNA TAKE IT OUT
ON THE REST OF US.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.852
WELL, FRANKLY,
SOME OF THEM NEED IT.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.284
I JUST CAME
FOR A LITTLE REMODEL,

27:35.284 --> 27:37.286
AND THERE ARE
SOME REAL TEARDOWNS OUT THERE.

27:37.286 --> 27:39.358
WOW. YOU ARE ONE SPOILED,
SELFISH, LITTLE BRAT.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.361
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, EDIE,
IT'S A STUPID EXERCISE CLASS.

27:42.361 --> 27:45.865
I TRIED IT. IT SUCKED.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.868
LIGHTEN UP.
 WELL, THAT STUPID LITTLE
EXERCISE CLASS IS FILLED

27:48.868 --> 27:51.801
WITH WOMEN WHO BUST THEIR ASSES
THREE TIMES A WEEK

27:51.801 --> 27:54.303
WHILE RAISING KIDS
AND HOLDING DOWN FULL-TIME JOBS.

27:54.303 --> 27:56.806
WELL, THEY'RE CRAZY.
HE YELLS, AND THEY JUMP.

27:56.806 --> 27:59.879
HE TELLS THEM TO RUN ALL THE WAY
OVER HERE, AND THEY DO IT.

27:59.879 --> 28:03.452
HE DIDN'T MAKE US COME HERE.
WE AGREED TO.

28:03.452 --> 28:06.315
WHAT THE HELL FOR?

28:06.315 --> 28:08.017
BECAUSE YOU TOLD US

28:08.017 --> 28:12.021
THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU
TO GET INTO THAT DRESS.

28:12.021 --> 28:14.163

WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU GOT HER--

A SELF-CENTERED,
OBNOXIOUS JERK.

28:25.474 --> 28:29.308
PERSONALLY, I LIKED
POOR, PAUNCHY GABY BETTER.

32:13.262 --> 32:15.264
HEY,
CAN I BORROW YOU A SEC?

32:15.264 --> 32:18.637
NOW? PEOPLE ARE WAITING.
 YOU'LL STILL BE A CELEBRITY
IN FIVE MINUTES. COME ON.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.939
EXCUSE ME.

32:25.975 --> 32:28.177
(siren wailing in distance)

32:28.177 --> 32:30.419
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS?

32:30.419 --> 32:33.182
OH, DEAR. I WAS HOPING
TO SPARE YOUR FEELINGS,

32:33.182 --> 32:36.385
BUT SINCE YOU KNOW, I WASN'T
COMFORTABLE HAVING MY RECIPE

32:36.385 --> 32:38.957
MADE WITH
SUBSTANDARD INGREDIENTS.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.130
WE USE THAT PARMESAN
ALL THE TIME.

32:41.130 --> 32:44.433
YOU CAN'T GO CHANGING THINGS
WITHOUT ASKING ME.

32:44.433 --> 32:46.395
HEY, YOU MADE ME PARTNER.

32:46.395 --> 32:49.338
I CAN CHANGE 15%,
AND I CHOSE THE PARMESAN.

32:49.338 --> 32:51.340
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE HEARD,

32:51.340 --> 32:53.372
BUT PEOPLE ARE RAVING
ABOUT MY PIZZA.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.674
WELL, THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
LOVED MY PIZZA, TOO,

32:55.674 --> 32:57.376
BUT WE'LL NEVER KNOW,

32:57.376 --> 33:00.379
BECAUSE MY PARTNER THREW IT
IN THE GARBAGE. WHAT A WASTE.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.482
FINE. I'LL REIMBURSE YOU,
IF THAT'LL MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.255
OH, SURE.
IT'S ONLY MONEY, RIGHT?

33:06.255 --> 33:09.188
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

33:09.188 --> 33:11.260
WE ALL KNOW HOW WELL
YOU'RE DOING, BREE.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.322
YOU HAVE MADE THAT
VERY CLEAR.

33:13.322 --> 33:15.664
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE
LORDING IT OVER EVERYBODY

33:15.664 --> 33:17.696
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'VE CAUGHT
A COUPLE OF BREAKS.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.398
CAUGHT A COUPLE OF BREAKS?

33:19.398 --> 33:23.032
I'VE WORKED MY ASS OFF
TO GET WHERE I AM.

33:23.032 --> 33:26.035
I'VE WORKED MY ASS OFF, TOO.
I JUST WASN'T AS LUCKY AS YOU.

33:26.035 --> 33:29.238
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT WE CREATE OUR OWN LUCK.

33:29.238 --> 33:31.380
MEANING THAT I'VE CREATED
MY OWN FAILURE?

33:31.380 --> 33:35.714
WELL, NOT COMPLETELY, BUT LET'S
FACE IT. YOU DO CUT CORNERS.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.716
I MEAN, ONE OF THE THINGS
I CAN TEACH YOU

33:37.716 --> 33:40.719
IS THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL.
 WOW. TALK ABOUT LUCK.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.722
WHEN I OFFERED TO THROW YOU
THIS LITTLE THANK-YOU PARTY,

33:43.722 --> 33:46.725
I NEVER IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD
TURN INTO AN OPPORTUNITY

33:46.725 --> 33:50.329
FOR ME TO LEARN
FROM THE GREAT BREE HODGE.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.461
WELL, I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO NEEDED $20,000

33:52.461 --> 33:54.433
TO KEEP MY BUSINESS AFLOAT.

33:54.433 --> 33:58.067
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S NEVER
GONNA LET ME FORGET IT.
 WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

33:58.067 --> 34:01.270
HOME. TELL ME HOW THE PARTY
I THREW FOR YOU TURNS OUT.

34:01.270 --> 34:05.144
LYNETTE, I-I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE SO UPSET.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.545
I KNOW YOU DON'T,

34:06.545 --> 34:08.577
BUT FIVE YEARS AGO,
YOU WOULD'VE.

34:08.577 --> 34:10.047
(crash)

34:11.420 --> 34:13.282
MY CAR!

34:15.224 --> 34:18.056
YOU KNOW THAT WAS
AN ACCIDENT, RIGHT?

34:19.588 --> 34:22.561
I DID THE BEST I COULD
ON THE CLASP, MRS. SOLIS.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.135
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

34:26.135 --> 34:27.596
OKAY, BE HONEST.

34:27.596 --> 34:30.139
(singsongy) HERE I COME.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.773
(gasps)

34:40.149 --> 34:42.150
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

34:42.150 --> 34:45.284
YOU ARE STUNNING.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.556
RADIANT.

34:47.556 --> 34:49.217
REALLY?

34:49.217 --> 34:50.418
REALLY.

34:50.418 --> 34:52.221
YOU'RE BACK, MRS. SOLIS,

34:52.221 --> 34:54.693
EXACTLY LIKE
YOU WERE BEFORE.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.496
OH, I THINK I'VE CHANGED
A LITTLE BIT.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.798
NOT THAT I CAN SEE.

35:03.802 --> 35:07.436
IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE,
I'LL BE GOING.

35:07.436 --> 35:08.677
JEAN, WAIT.

35:08.677 --> 35:10.679
WHAT IS IT?
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

35:10.679 --> 35:13.582
NO, NO. IT'S PERFECT.
(chuckles)

35:13.582 --> 35:15.544
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU

35:15.544 --> 35:17.886
HOW HELPFUL YOU'VE BEEN TO ME
OVER THE YEARS,

35:17.886 --> 35:20.389
AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL.

35:20.389 --> 35:22.551
THANK YOU.

35:32.401 --> 35:35.133
HEY, BUDDY. HOW WAS
THE REST OF THE... (grunts)

35:35.133 --> 35:36.535
OH!

35:36.535 --> 35:39.368
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

35:39.368 --> 35:41.410
WHAT?!
 DON'T GIVE ME THAT!

35:41.410 --> 35:46.315
I KNOW THAT YOU TOLD THE COPS
THAT PORTER SET THAT FIRE.
 I DIDN'T SAY HE SET THE FIRE.

35:46.315 --> 35:48.917
I ONLY SAID I SAW HIM
IN THE BACK HALLWAY.

35:48.917 --> 35:51.250
YOU COULDN'T HAVE!
HE WASN'T THERE!

35:51.250 --> 35:54.253
TOM, THE COPS
WERE REALLY GRILLING ME.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.684
THEY WOULDN'T LET UP.

35:55.684 --> 35:58.887
I HAD TO TELL THEM
WHAT I THOUGHT I SAW.

35:58.887 --> 36:01.790
PORTER COULD HAVE
GONE TO JAIL.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.833
YOU ALMOST DESTROYED MY FAMILY,
DESTROYED OUR BUSINESS.

36:04.833 --> 36:07.796
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
I SWEAR.

36:07.796 --> 36:10.599
I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT YOU OR LYNETTE.

36:10.599 --> 36:13.602
OH, LYNETTE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS. I DIDN'T TELL HER.

36:13.602 --> 36:15.944
IF I HAD, YOU'D BE DEAD.

36:15.944 --> 36:18.547
I AM SO SORRY.

36:18.547 --> 36:20.779
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE SAID
ANYTHING TO THE COPS.

36:20.779 --> 36:24.313
IT WAS DARK. I'D BEEN DRINKING.
YOU'VE GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

36:24.313 --> 36:27.286
(grunts)

36:27.286 --> 36:28.457
STOP.

36:28.457 --> 36:30.659
JUST STOP.

36:30.659 --> 36:32.361
(grunts)

36:32.361 --> 36:33.762
ARE YOU DONE?

36:33.762 --> 36:35.564
YEAH.

36:37.266 --> 36:40.429
(sighs) THIS IS CRAZY.

36:40.429 --> 36:43.432
I MEAN, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

36:43.432 --> 36:45.874
WE'RE FRIENDS.

36:45.874 --> 36:48.607
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO.

36:50.339 --> 36:52.341
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO
YOU ARE.

36:57.486 --> 37:01.290
TOM.

37:01.290 --> 37:03.952
TOM.

37:03.952 --> 37:07.596
(growls)

37:21.470 --> 37:23.472
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

37:23.472 --> 37:26.244
GO AHEAD. SHOOT.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.347
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

37:28.347 --> 37:30.749
ABOUT YOUR FIRST WIFE.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.451
EDIE.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.884
I KNOW. JUST ONE QUESTION,
AND THEN I'LL SHUT IT.

37:35.884 --> 37:38.787
I DON'T LIKE
TALKING ABOUT HER.

37:38.787 --> 37:41.790
IT HAS BEEN WEEKS SINCE
I FOUND OUT SHE EVEN EXISTED,

37:41.790 --> 37:43.792
AND I'VE NEVER MENTIONED HER
ONCE.

37:43.792 --> 37:49.338
COME ON.
LOOK AT THIS AS MY REWARD.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.741
OKAY.

37:52.741 --> 37:54.343
ONE QUESTION.

37:56.004 --> 37:59.478
BEING MARRIED TO HER...
 MM-HMM.

37:59.478 --> 38:02.411
OR BEING MARRIED TO ME...
 MM.

38:02.411 --> 38:05.554
WHAT'S
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE?

38:05.554 --> 38:08.457
HONESTLY?

38:08.457 --> 38:11.620
OUR MARRIAGE IS MORE REAL.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.362
REALLY?

38:13.362 --> 38:14.863
MM.

38:14.863 --> 38:16.865
IN WHAT WAY?

38:20.599 --> 38:23.632
WELL, WITH HER,
IT WAS LIKE...

38:23.632 --> 38:24.973
A FAIRY TALE.

38:24.973 --> 38:28.377
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD LAST FOREVER.

38:28.377 --> 38:30.439
IT DIDN'T.

38:30.439 --> 38:32.741
WHAT YOU AND I HAVE
 IS MORE REAL

38:32.741 --> 38:35.714
BECAUSE I KNOW
IT'S NOT FOREVER.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.547
WHEN I HOLD YOU,

38:38.547 --> 38:40.549
WHEN I KISS YOU,

38:40.549 --> 38:43.321
I TRY TO REMIND MYSELF
TO APPRECIATE THE MOMENT,

38:43.321 --> 38:45.624
BECAUSE TOMORROW
MAY NEVER COME.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.996
LOVE...

38:47.996 --> 38:53.331
IS JUST TEMPORARY.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.004
THE WAY
THE FAIRY TALE ENDS...

38:56.004 --> 38:57.806
IS DEATH.

39:04.072 --> 39:06.415
MY FIRST INSTINCT

39:06.415 --> 39:09.578
WAS TO ASK YOU
IF SHE WAS PRETTIER THAN ME.

39:09.578 --> 39:13.622
WHEN WILL I LEARN
TO GO WITH MY GUT?

39:13.622 --> 39:16.124
(sighs)

39:21.560 --> 39:24.533
I'M SORRY.
YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE TUITION?

39:24.533 --> 39:25.634
NO.

39:25.634 --> 39:27.836
BUT I READ IN YOUR BROCHURE

39:27.836 --> 39:30.539
THAT FACULTY MEMBERS
GET A 50% DISCOUNT,

39:30.539 --> 39:32.771
SO FOR YOUR ART DEPARTMENT,

39:32.771 --> 39:35.574
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HIRE

39:35.574 --> 39:38.807
AN AWARD-WINNING
CHILDREN'S BOOK ILLUSTRATOR

39:38.807 --> 39:42.911
WHO IS GREAT WITH KIDS AND HAS
A FACE YOU CAN'T SAY NO TO?

39:42.911 --> 39:44.453
UNFORTUNATELY,

39:44.453 --> 39:46.585
OUR ART DEPARTMENT IS
FULLY STAFFED.

39:47.916 --> 39:50.459
CAN'T SAY NO.
(chuckles nervously)

39:50.459 --> 39:52.591
MISS MAYER,

39:52.591 --> 39:55.093
I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM

39:55.093 --> 39:56.825
AND THE FACE,

39:56.825 --> 39:59.468
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT JUST WON'T WORK OUT.

39:59.468 --> 40:01.029
I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK.

40:01.029 --> 40:03.872
YES.

40:05.634 --> 40:07.405
RIGHT.

40:11.039 --> 40:13.041
NO, WRONG.

40:13.041 --> 40:16.114
MISS MAYER, PLEASE,
I'M SO BUSY.

40:16.114 --> 40:19.618
LOOK, I KNOW I SAID
THAT M.J. WAS A STAR STUDENT,

40:19.618 --> 40:21.550
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

40:21.550 --> 40:24.553
HE'S ONE OF THOSE KIDS
THAT NEEDS EXTRA ATTENTION.

40:24.553 --> 40:27.055
THE CLASSES AT HIS SCHOOL
ARE WAY TOO BIG,

40:27.055 --> 40:30.098
AND I SEE HIM GETTING LOST
IN THE SHUFFLE.

40:30.098 --> 40:33.131
AND IF HE GETS LOST NOW...

40:33.131 --> 40:34.703
(sighs)

40:34.703 --> 40:37.566
MY EX-HUSBAND IS DOING
EVERYTHING THAT HE CAN,

40:37.566 --> 40:40.569
AND I NEED TO KNOW
THAT I AM, TOO.

40:42.511 --> 40:44.673
I WILL SERVE LUNCHES.

40:44.673 --> 40:47.015
I WILL BE A JANITOR.

40:47.015 --> 40:48.677
ANYTHING.

40:50.549 --> 40:54.122
BUT I AM NOT WALKING OUT
ON MY SON'S FUTURE.

40:56.955 --> 41:01.860
WELL, ONE OF OUR ART TEACHERS
DOES NEED AN ASSISTANT,

41:01.860 --> 41:04.092
BUT YOU'RE
COMPLETELY OVERQUALIFIED.

41:04.092 --> 41:06.535
I'LL TAKE IT.

41:10.499 --> 41:12.641
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NEW JOB.

41:12.641 --> 41:14.703
CONGRATULATIONS

41:14.703 --> 41:17.606
ON GETTING ME
OUT OF YOUR OFFICE.

41:21.049 --> 41:23.181
WHAT'S THAT?

41:23.181 --> 41:25.584
A CHECK FOR THE DAMAGE
TO YOUR CAR.

41:25.584 --> 41:28.256
I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO THROUGH
MY INSURANCE COMPANY.

41:28.256 --> 41:30.759
OH, LYNETTE, DON'T BE SILLY.
IT'S JUST THE BUMPER.

41:30.759 --> 41:34.092
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.694
YES, I DO.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.196
AND THE MINUTE
WE'RE BACK ON OUR FEET,

41:38.196 --> 41:40.498
I AM GONNA PAY BACK
YOUR INVESTMENT--

41:40.498 --> 41:42.130
EVERY PENNY,

41:42.130 --> 41:44.833
WITH INTEREST.

41:44.833 --> 41:48.607
LYNETTE, STOP. WAIT. PLEASE.
DON'T BE THIS WAY.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.209
I DON'T WANT MONEY TO GET
IN THE WAY OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.981
YEAH...

41:52.981 --> 41:55.684
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT.

42:02.591 --> 42:04.092
(door closes)

42:08.226 --> 42:12.961
THERE'S A LOT YOU CAN DO
WITH MONEY IN THE SUBURBS.

42:12.961 --> 42:16.134
YOU CAN PAY
FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN.

42:20.609 --> 42:23.171
YOU CAN PROVIDE
A PRIVATE SCHOOL EDUCATION.

42:28.046 --> 42:32.020
YOU CAN PURCHASE
A TOKEN OF AFFECTION.

42:35.784 --> 42:38.957
BUT THE ONE THING
YOU MUST NEVER DO WITH MONEY

42:38.957 --> 42:41.860
IS USE IT AS A WEAPON,

42:41.860 --> 42:44.993
BECAUSE SOMEONE...

42:44.993 --> 42:48.667
ALWAYS GETS HURT.
