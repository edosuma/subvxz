I need asylum.

Please!

01:00.408 --> 01:01.800
- What is going on here?

back at work.

01:47.455 --> 01:50.153

full clearance.

01:50.197 --> 01:53.983
No restrictions.
I'm good to go.

01:54.026 --> 01:56.377
- He seemed a little more
cautious when I spoke to him.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.030
- Meaning?

01:58.074 --> 02:00.598
- How about we just start you
off with modified duty?

02:00.642 --> 02:02.992
- Desk duty.
- Yeah, just for a bit.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.865
- If seeing each other
is gonna make you overreact

02:06.909 --> 02:08.606
as my boss and try to keep me
in bubble wrap,

02:08.650 --> 02:10.739
then this isn't gonna work.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.523
I don't know how else
to say it.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.612
- Jamie,
this is not an overreaction.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.180
You took a bullet.
Why rush back?

02:17.224 --> 02:18.877
- Because apprehensiveness
isn't a habit

02:18.921 --> 02:20.923
I want to start picking up now.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.891
- Hey, did you ever notice
that Forrester always comes

02:32.935 --> 02:35.416
into the office about
five seconds after Kellett?

02:35.459 --> 02:38.027
- No.
Maybe.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.638
- I'm not saying I care,
at all.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.379
But for two top-level agents,

02:42.423 --> 02:44.294
both with heavy-duty
undercover experience,

02:44.338 --> 02:45.643
do they really think walking in

02:45.687 --> 02:46.949
five seconds apart
is fooling anyone?

02:46.992 --> 02:48.385
- Would you ever?

02:48.429 --> 02:50.300
- What?
Date someone from work?

02:50.344 --> 02:52.737
- Yeah.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.610
- Depends on the coworker.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.438
You?
- Never.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.918
I mean, I've seen it blow up
too many times.

03:02.573 --> 03:03.879
- Morning.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.837
Anything for me here?

03:05.881 --> 03:07.187
Yeah? Okay.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.449
Nope?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.800
Oh, my God.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.976
You guys...

03:14.019 --> 03:15.195
- Good morning.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.589
Very nice.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.330
- We got cake.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.680
Or, I mean, maybe we should get
into the details of the case

03:22.724 --> 03:23.681
that came in?
- Yeah, let's do it.

03:25.988 --> 03:30.210
- U.S. Cit is Drew Edmonson,
24, from Tacoma.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.646
In Madrid on a student's visa,

03:31.689 --> 03:34.039
studying at the College
for International Studies.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.303
He's at the U.S. Embassy
claiming that he found

03:36.346 --> 03:38.870
his boyfriend dead
in the boyfriend's apartment.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.917
Rafael Delgado, 32.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.311
Edmonson called the police
when he discovered the body,

03:44.354 --> 03:47.052
but then he panicked
and ran to the embassy

03:47.096 --> 03:48.663
six blocks away for safety.

03:48.706 --> 03:51.100
- Our contact at the embassy
is Deputy Chief of Mission,

03:51.143 --> 03:52.754
Emma Healey.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.191
She is the State Department Rep
and the new ambassador

03:55.235 --> 03:56.932
to Spain's right-hand woman.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.021
So Jaeger is there,
and she'll help coordinate.

03:59.064 --> 04:01.241
- Oh, I just got
a message from her.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.852
"Heads up, the Madrid police
are PISSED"--

04:03.895 --> 04:05.680
all caps--
-

04:05.723 --> 04:07.203
- "That we have their suspect

04:07.247 --> 04:08.596
and they can't gain access
to him."

04:08.639 --> 04:10.206
- Already called the jet.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.555
Ready when we are.
- All right, let's hit it.

04:13.383 --> 04:16.081
- You're not coming?
- Desk duty.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.040
Until informed otherwise.
- Ah.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.314
-
- What's up, Katrin?

04:31.358 --> 04:32.576
- Quite a bit.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.578
The ambassador is hosting
a ball tomorrow

04:34.622 --> 04:36.450
for the Spanish Prime Minister
and other dignitaries.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.103
- Mm, so drag this out as long
as possible

04:38.147 --> 04:40.018
is what you're saying?

04:40.062 --> 04:42.325
The ambassador's new, right?

04:42.369 --> 04:44.327
- Yes,
he's been here two weeks.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.720
- What's his background?

04:45.763 --> 04:47.635
- Pharmaceutical magnate
who was given this post

04:47.678 --> 04:49.898
as a "thank you"
for his political donations.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.596
- Great,
so he's in over his head.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.774
- Emma.
- This the team?

04:56.818 --> 04:59.255
- Indeed.
- Hello, welcome.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.431
I'm Emma Healey, I'm
the Deputy Chief of Mission.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.346
Your liaison
at the National Police

05:03.390 --> 05:04.869
is going to be
Inspector Mateo Diaz.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.349
And he's very eager
to meet with you,

05:06.393 --> 05:08.003
so if we can make that happen
as soon as possible,

05:08.046 --> 05:09.526
that would be great.

05:09.570 --> 05:12.094
Oh, and here's
our ambassador now.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.270
His name is Gary Berger,
but you can address him

05:14.314 --> 05:17.360
as either Mr. Ambassador
or Ambassador Berger.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.537
Ambassador Berger, this is the
FBI fly team I briefed you on.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.670
- Oh, nice to meet you all.
- Likewise.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.889
- Whatever you guys need,
just let Emma know,

05:24.933 --> 05:26.674
and we'll make it happen.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.371
You're aware of the ball
I'm hosting?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.807
- We are.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.983
- So if this whole mess
could be cleaned up

05:32.027 --> 05:34.812
as expeditiously as possible,

05:34.856 --> 05:36.858
I'd be indebted.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.773
Whatever they need.
- Yes, Mr. Ambassador.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.864
- If you could point us in
the direction of Mr. Edmonson?

05:42.907 --> 05:44.300
- Yes, follow me.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.519
Right this way please.
Thank you.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.525
- We met at a café at Malasaña
four months ago.

05:53.962 --> 05:56.617
Rafael didn't come out
to his family yet.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.663
Or to himself, to be honest.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.406
His family is very religious,

06:03.450 --> 06:05.626
very conservative,

06:05.669 --> 06:08.237
very influential.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.631
They live in Toledo,
and they go back,

06:10.674 --> 06:14.199
I don't know
how many generations.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.071
He kept an apartment
here in Madrid,

06:16.114 --> 06:18.682
but he would go home and stay
with his parents most weekends.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.249
- He have a job?

06:20.292 --> 06:23.295
- He was a comptroller
for a real estate company.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.907
I didn't really know
much beyond that.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.475
I'm a liberal arts major.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.913
Accounting wasn't a huge topic
of conversation for us.

06:31.956 --> 06:35.438
- Did Rafael have
any problems with anyone?

06:35.482 --> 06:38.572
Any threats?
Any lawsuits?

06:38.615 --> 06:40.312
- Not that I know of.

06:43.228 --> 06:47.624
But he did come out
to his family a week ago,

06:47.668 --> 06:51.541
and according to Rafael,
it wasn't met warmly.

06:51.585 --> 06:54.457
And that was really the only
source of anxiety in his life.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.067
Again, that I knew of.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.463
What happened last night?

07:04.293 --> 07:06.687
- I went to his apartment
at 9:00 p.m.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.475
I have a key.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.650
Walking up the stairs,

07:13.694 --> 07:16.087
I saw a man close
Rafael's apartment door,

07:16.131 --> 07:18.786
which I thought was odd.

07:18.829 --> 07:21.571
He walked quickly
down the stairs, passing me.

07:25.706 --> 07:29.666
I walked into the apartment,

07:29.710 --> 07:32.016
and I found Rafael.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.714
On the floor.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.457
There was so much blood.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.414
It looked like
he'd been stabbed

07:38.458 --> 07:40.372
in the chest many times.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.810
I tried chest compressions,
but...

07:45.029 --> 07:47.379
I called the police.

07:47.423 --> 07:50.644
And then I realized
they might think that I did it.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.733
- Why?

07:52.776 --> 07:56.301
- I'm a foreigner. I'm gay.

07:56.345 --> 07:59.609
Rafael comes from
a very powerful family.

07:59.653 --> 08:02.307
I knew that the embassy
was close by,

08:02.351 --> 08:03.526
and something
in the back of my head

08:03.570 --> 08:05.833
said to run there
so I'd be treated fairly.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.835
I didn't really think
much beyond that.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.840
You will be treated fairly.

08:12.883 --> 08:15.103
But this will be thoroughly
investigated.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.497
And the truth will come out.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.586
So...

08:19.629 --> 08:22.458
if it went down any different
than what you just said,

08:22.502 --> 08:25.505
save us some time
and some effort.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.811
And save yourself
some goodwill.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.640
- I swear to you,
I didn't kill Rafael.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.080
- We're gonna need
a physical description

08:36.124 --> 08:37.995
of the guy you saw
on the staircase.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.475
And a full account
of where you were

08:39.519 --> 08:41.172
prior to finding the body.

08:45.394 --> 08:48.571
- Special Agent Forrester,
Raines, Vo.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.877
Inspector Diaz.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.356
- It's nice to meet you,
Inspector Diaz.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.488
We look forward
to working with you.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.881
- I want to speak
with Drew Edmonson.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.447
- Soon.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.406
Once we get a full sense
of what happened last night.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.887
- Has he confessed?
- Has not.

08:59.930 --> 09:01.932
Quite the opposite.
- And you believe him?

09:01.976 --> 09:04.369
- Uh, still early.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.198
- Why would he run to the
embassy unless he was guilty?

09:07.242 --> 09:10.332
- Let's just join forces,
figure that out.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.552
- You have a room
we can work out of, Inspector?

09:14.597 --> 09:16.120
- We're gonna need
to see the crime scene,

09:16.164 --> 09:18.166
and if you could provide us
with all pertinent information

09:18.209 --> 09:19.776
and list of potential suspects.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.735
<i>- Por favor.</i>

09:24.346 --> 09:26.914
- Edmonson said he saw a man
leaving Delgado's apartment

09:26.957 --> 09:28.263
as he was walking
up the stairs.

09:28.306 --> 09:31.614
- Perhaps he was lying
about that.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.399
Do criminals lie
to the police in America?

09:34.443 --> 09:37.054
Because, here, they do.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.101
We only have one suspect.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.151
This is
where Rafael Delgado lived.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.413
Second floor.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.247
- Who are they?

09:56.291 --> 09:59.033
- The mother and
the older brother of Delgado.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.296
- They're not removing items
from Delgado's apartment,

10:01.339 --> 10:03.515
are they?
- It would appear so.

10:03.559 --> 10:05.430
- So the crime scene
hasn't been secured.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.781
- It was,
but we did a thorough search.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.000
And now it is time
for the family to heal.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.611
<i>Después de usted.</i>

10:23.013 --> 10:25.755
- I'm assuming your crime scene
unit photographed the apartment

10:25.799 --> 10:28.279
before it was picked over?
- They did.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.499
- Mm-hmm, and Delgado's body
is at the morgue?

10:30.542 --> 10:32.240
- No, it's not.
- No.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.461
And it's at the taxidermist,
or?

10:36.505 --> 10:38.899
- The body was inspected
by our medical examiner

10:38.942 --> 10:40.727
and then transferred
to the family this morning.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.293
- Why so quickly?

10:42.337 --> 10:45.209
- A rapid burial is advisable
here in Madrid

10:45.253 --> 10:48.038
due to the limited burial space
in Catholic cemeteries.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.910
So most families try to bury
their loved ones

10:49.953 --> 10:51.389
within 24 hours,

10:51.433 --> 10:53.348
especially when
the weather is hot.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.872
I don't know
if you've been around a corpse

10:55.916 --> 10:59.441
in 38-degree heat--
Celsius, I'm referring to--

10:59.484 --> 11:02.705
but if that can be avoided,
you'd be well served.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.534
- Laptop, cell phone?
- We have both.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.493
Password protected.
We're working on it.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.244
- Breathe.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.165
- My mother heard arguing
last night.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.081
Two men.
- What were they arguing about?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.353
- She only heard pieces,
and mostly about money.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.877
But then one of them yelled,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.835
"I'm not going
to do this anymore."

11:45.879 --> 11:47.750
- Was it Rafael
who yelled that?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.625
- She thinks so.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.150
- All right.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.892
The mom said the argument
was at 8:45,

11:58.935 --> 12:00.763
which, according
to Edmonson's account,

12:00.807 --> 12:02.156
would have been
before he arrived.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.940
- Did you verify his alibi
for last night?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.116
- Everything until 8:00 p.m.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.902
After that, he said he was
walking around the park.

12:11.687 --> 12:12.993
<i>- Hola.</i>

12:17.475 --> 12:18.781
- What's that all about?

12:20.435 --> 12:22.176
- Hello?

12:25.222 --> 12:27.790
<i>♪</i>

12:27.834 --> 12:29.836
I see.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.098
Hold on a second.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.536
You're not gonna like this.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.759
- Well, did you check--
I have to--I have to go.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.633
Our attorney at the DOJ
spoke with Mr. Edmonson,

12:44.676 --> 12:46.504
and Mr. Edmonson's decided
to self-surrender

12:46.548 --> 12:48.593
to the Madrid police.
- The hell he did.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.726
That kid was scared
out of his mind.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.423
There is no way he would choose
to leave here.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.817
- Well, we have a signed
document that states otherwise,

12:54.861 --> 12:56.558
so--
- This embassy is U.S. soil.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.951
Have you ever heard
of the Fifth Amendment?

12:57.994 --> 12:59.648
- The Madrid police
have given us their word

12:59.691 --> 13:00.649
that they will continue
to cooperate

13:00.692 --> 13:02.129
with your entire
investigation--

13:02.172 --> 13:04.653
- They have already made up
their mind about this kid.

13:04.696 --> 13:06.133
- Well, it's out of my hands.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.917
And out of Ambassador Berger's
hands at this point,

13:07.961 --> 13:10.180
so you keep us posted,
Agent Forrester.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.008
Ambassador Berger will be
expecting updates.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.967
- You guys got worked.

13:14.010 --> 13:17.448
<i>♪</i>

13:25.239 --> 13:27.328
<i>♪</i>

13:28.764 --> 13:31.636
- Welcome back.
I take it you've been informed.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.769
- I've been informed. <i>
- Maravilloso.</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:36.206
- I need to see Edmonson.
- Soon.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.992
We're conducting
our own interrogation,

13:39.035 --> 13:40.732
as you did.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.300
And when we're done,
you'll be notified, huh?

13:45.433 --> 13:46.782
- Edmonson said he saw

13:46.826 --> 13:48.479
the assailant leave
Delgado's apartment.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.568
That means
the assailant saw Edmonson.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.874
His life could be in danger.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.354
He needs to be put
in protective custody.

13:53.397 --> 13:54.746
- I have--

13:54.790 --> 13:57.358
I am certain Edmonson
sees the assailant

13:57.401 --> 13:59.273
every time he looks
in the mirror.

13:59.316 --> 14:03.277
- Why are you so resistant to
doing a thorough investigation?

14:03.320 --> 14:06.889
- Do you not have people
that you answer to

14:06.933 --> 14:08.848
in your job, Agent?
- Hell yes, I do.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.589
But I push back when
it's the right thing to do.

14:11.633 --> 14:15.202
- It's, uh, it's inspiring.
Truly.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.682
Unfortunately, the conference
room you were using earlier

14:17.726 --> 14:19.119
is now being used
for a birthday party.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.382
So...

14:21.425 --> 14:25.125
We will have to provide you
with alternate accommodations.

14:31.653 --> 14:34.264
Do you have anything smaller?

14:34.308 --> 14:35.875
- I can't believe
this is all the photos

14:35.918 --> 14:37.572
they took of his body.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.574
No mention of the angle
of the entry wound,

14:39.617 --> 14:40.967
theorized height
of the assailant,

14:41.010 --> 14:43.708
whether the assailant
was left or right-handed.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.014
Look, I could go on.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.669
- Edmonson is an open book
on social media.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.237
Some photos of Delgado
on his posts, but no pictures

14:50.280 --> 14:52.717
that would indicate
a romantic involvement

14:52.761 --> 14:55.938
until one of their posts
from a few days ago.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.636
Delgado mostly posts
about sunsets and tapas.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.377
Very buttoned-up personality.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.817
- We need to talk
to the brother.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.521
So what did you take

15:13.564 --> 15:15.958
out of your brother's apartment
this morning?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.917
- Photos, mostly.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.094
- Of what?
- Rafael.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.618
And the man who killed him.
- Who's that?

15:23.661 --> 15:25.533
- You know who.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.187
Drew Edmonson.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.974
- Why remove the photos?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.845
- My mother wanted them gone.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.718
- Have you ever met
Drew Edmonson?

15:36.761 --> 15:38.024
- No.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.461
- Did your brother
ever mention him?

15:40.504 --> 15:43.333
- Once.
A week ago.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.901
- And how did
he characterize him?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.425
- Favorably.

15:48.469 --> 15:51.124
- Did your brother have anyone
making threats against him?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.995
- Not that I knew of.

15:53.039 --> 15:57.565
- Anyone have a problem with
him coming out two weeks ago?

15:57.608 --> 15:59.523
- Enough of a problem
to kill him?

15:59.567 --> 16:01.221
No.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.353
- Did you have
a problem with him?

16:04.659 --> 16:07.357
- I suppose so.
Many years ago.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.928
I always had a feeling
that Rafael might be gay.

16:15.713 --> 16:19.282
My parents, though, they're
from a different generation.

16:19.326 --> 16:22.242
- And how did they react
when he came out to them

16:22.285 --> 16:23.678
about his sexuality?

16:25.680 --> 16:26.942
- This conversation seems to be

16:26.986 --> 16:28.552
drifting away
from Drew Edmonson.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.032
You're not convinced
he's the killer?

16:30.076 --> 16:31.816
Because he's a fellow American?

16:31.860 --> 16:34.254
- No, we just want to know
for sure.

16:34.297 --> 16:38.040
No matter how much time
and effort it takes.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.955
- You must get paid
by the hour.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.176
- You have your doubts as well.
- Do I?

16:43.219 --> 16:46.005
- Otherwise you wouldn't
have met with us.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.670
- I just don't know
what to think.

16:59.714 --> 17:03.152
- What happened with
your brother is unspeakable.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.415
We are just looking
for the truth,

17:05.459 --> 17:08.027
and we can't find it
unless you help us.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.076
- Where did your brother work?

17:16.557 --> 17:18.515
- He worked as a comptroller

17:18.559 --> 17:21.518
at a real estate
investment firm.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.912
The company's owned
by a friend of the family.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.219
- We would very much appreciate
it if you could make a call

17:26.262 --> 17:27.829
and get us in there.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.402
- We'll need you to pull
all the records, accounts,

17:35.445 --> 17:37.534
and emails
that Rafael generated.

17:37.578 --> 17:40.276
- Of course, Thiago said
to grant you full access.

17:40.320 --> 17:44.106
- Rafael's office, and we need
any passwords you have for him.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.890
- Of course. <i>
Anna, por favor.</i>

17:48.197 --> 17:49.329
- I'm gonna get cracking
on his computer.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.286
- Yep.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.334
What can you tell us
about Rafael?

17:54.377 --> 17:57.989
- Uh, he was a great employee.

17:58.033 --> 18:01.602
A great coworker,
and a great friend.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.169
- You knew him well.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.348
-
Gosh, I'm--I'm sorry. I--

18:08.391 --> 18:10.089
- Hey.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.352
- I thought I was just going
to open his office for you.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.963
I--I didn't know you wanted
to talk about him.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.834
- I totally understand.
Okay?

18:16.878 --> 18:20.360
I'm sure it's still
very raw for you.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.145
- He was stuck.
- How so?

18:23.189 --> 18:25.104
- Stuck between
who he wanted to be,

18:25.147 --> 18:27.541
and who he needed to be
for his family.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.543
For as long as I knew him,
he was half a person.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.066
And it broke my heart.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.764
- You knew about Drew Edmonson?
- Yes.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.550
But Rafael had me swear
I wouldn't say anything.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.855
And I would say,

18:37.899 --> 18:40.336
"Rafael, cariño,
you're 32 years old.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.729
"It's okay to be yourself.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.339
Who cares about
what your parents think?"

18:43.383 --> 18:45.036
- Who'd want him dead?

18:45.080 --> 18:46.168
- I asked myself that
a million times

18:46.212 --> 18:47.735
the last couple of days.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.258
And the only thing
that I can think of

18:49.302 --> 18:53.088
is when he did come out,
he was so unprepared.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.264
'Cause he'd been so sheltered
his whole life, you know?

18:55.308 --> 18:58.398
So very easily,

18:58.441 --> 19:00.922
he could have been vulnerable
to the wrong person.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.358
- Mm.

19:06.057 --> 19:09.017
You seriously have a pencil
clenched in your teeth?

19:09.060 --> 19:11.106
- Mandatory if you're gonna
kick ass and crunch numbers.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.282
- I heard every third word
of that.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.719
- Guess what Delgado did
right before he was killed?

19:15.763 --> 19:18.418
- Tell me.
- He stole a lot of money.

19:18.461 --> 19:21.116
From his employer.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.074
- Oh.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.338
- As comptroller for
a real estate investment trust,

19:25.381 --> 19:27.340
he was responsible
for paying all their bills.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.864
REITs have dozens
of shell companies

19:29.907 --> 19:31.996
that buy up land
and housing assets.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.174
He'd know that his company
was processing huge payments.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.177
Wouldn't look into bills worth
less than 10, 20,000,

19:38.220 --> 19:41.136
so those bills
get paid real easy.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.139
- Hey, let me put you up
on the monitor.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.054
- Jamie, what do you got?

19:46.097 --> 19:47.316
<i>- Headquarters secured</i>

19:47.360 --> 19:49.362
<i>a forensic
financial analyst team</i>

19:49.405 --> 19:52.016
<i>at the Washington Field Office
to go over what Raines got.</i>

19:52.060 --> 19:54.454
They confirmed a very
sophisticated embezzlement

19:54.497 --> 19:59.241
of 250,000 euros implemented
by Delgado one month ago.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.722
<i>He set up a shell company
that did insurance</i>

20:01.765 --> 20:03.245
<i>and appraisal work,</i>

20:03.289 --> 20:05.073
<i>and then Delgado sent out
fictitious bills</i>

20:05.116 --> 20:06.944
<i>to the firm
through the shell company.</i>

20:06.988 --> 20:09.556
- That great, Jamie. <i>
- There's more.</i>

20:09.599 --> 20:11.122
Delgado needed proof
of identity

20:11.166 --> 20:13.342
for his shell companies
and couldn't use his own name,

20:13.386 --> 20:15.301
<i>so they were set up
at an American bank,</i>

20:15.344 --> 20:18.217
and those accounts were signed
by someone else.

20:22.003 --> 20:25.224
- Drew Edmonson.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.488
-
I think they call that motive.

20:36.322 --> 20:39.499
- Mr. Edmonson certainly has
a lovely signature, no?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.544
It's very elaborate.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.285
- We'd like to speak
to Edmonson

20:43.329 --> 20:44.895
if you'd be so gracious.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.332
- Regarding?

20:46.375 --> 20:47.681
- The extent of his involvement
in all this.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.813
- He signed his name
to the account.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.467
This is extortion
turned deadly.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.556
Do I really need to explain
to you what happened?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.384
- I'd rather hear it from him.

20:56.472 --> 20:59.606
- You still don't think
he killed Rafael Delgado?

20:59.649 --> 21:02.304
- Let's find out.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.263
- American optimism.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.963
I'll give you 15 minutes.

21:09.006 --> 21:12.183
After that, Mr. Edmonson will
be transported and arraigned.

21:15.056 --> 21:18.102
- So that's your signature?
- Yes.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.191
- Did you know the account
was funded with money that--

21:20.235 --> 21:22.585
- What account?
- The account you signed for.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.370
The copy of which is right
in front of your eyeballs.

21:24.413 --> 21:25.980
- I never signed
for an account.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.941
- What did you sign for?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.639
<i>- Rafael told me
it was documentation</i>

21:32.682 --> 21:34.162
<i>that would help him
get a work visa</i>

21:34.205 --> 21:36.251
<i>so he could visit me
in the U.S.</i>

21:36.295 --> 21:37.992
<i>- And you just scribbled
your name on it?</i>

21:38.035 --> 21:41.300
- It was in Spanish. Yes.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.562
I don't know anything
about an account--

21:42.605 --> 21:45.129
- Put yourself in our shoes
for one second.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.088
- I know! I know!

21:49.003 --> 21:53.094
I must sound crazy or gullible,
or both.

21:53.137 --> 21:56.358
But I swear I'm telling you
the truth.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.360
We were on our way
out to dinner

21:58.404 --> 22:00.188
and Rafael put these papers
in front of me

22:00.231 --> 22:01.972
and told me
it was about his visa.

22:02.016 --> 22:04.279
And then he handed me a pen,
and that was that.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.805
- You have another problem--

22:08.849 --> 22:11.982
your whereabouts the hour
before Rafael was killed.

22:12.026 --> 22:14.507
"Walking around the park"
isn't what we'd term

22:14.550 --> 22:16.639
an iron-clad alibi.

22:16.683 --> 22:20.251
- I stopped by a bakery
to pick up some tortas.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.079
- Why didn't you tell us this
the first time we spoke?

22:22.123 --> 22:23.864
- Because my boyfriend
was killed.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.779
And I had his blood on me.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.520
I apologize if I wasn't
thinking with utter clarity

22:27.563 --> 22:29.173
the last time we spoke.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.566
- The name of the bakery?

22:30.610 --> 22:34.918
<i>- Las Ventanas
on Paseo de Estrada.</i>

22:42.709 --> 22:44.972
- How'd you get that bruise?
- I was jumped.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.761
