Sunny, Petal, there you are.

01:56.464 --> 02:01.904
We discovered a new
clover field, Queen Buttercup

02:01.947 --> 02:05.125
full of clover blossoms.

02:05.168 --> 02:08.824
And have collected tons
of pollen for the hive.

02:08.866 --> 02:13.350
Great job,
Sunny and Petal, everybody
in the hive just loves clover.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.396
I know, right?

02:15.439 --> 02:17.224
Who doesn't?

How did you ever find
the clover field, little ones?

02:20.227 --> 02:23.012
Bailey, the dog,
told us about it.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.710
Oh our good friend,
Bailey the dog.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.017
Yes, Queen Buttercup.

02:28.060 --> 02:32.761
You see, Bailey has
a very good sense of smell.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.720
And when we asked him
if he could find a field

02:35.764 --> 02:37.896
of clover for us, he said:

02:37.940 --> 02:40.638
"Sure thing, little bees.

02:40.682 --> 02:46.557
I can sniff out a great big
clover field for you and yours."

02:46.601 --> 02:49.038
You will collect
enough sweet nectar

02:49.081 --> 02:51.562
to keep your hive fed
all winter long."

02:58.874 --> 03:01.268
Bailey, the dog is
a very kind friend indeed.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.662
I'm sure
you thanked him for showing
you the way to this field.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.187
[narrator] Sunny and Petal,
realized they have not

03:07.230 --> 03:10.407
thanked, Bailey, the dog,
for his amazing gift.

03:10.451 --> 03:15.412
-No, Queen Buttercup.
-We forgot.

03:15.456 --> 03:19.851
Sunny, Petal,
you know the importance
of being thankful, don't you?

03:19.895 --> 03:24.595
Hum... we're not sure,
Queen Buttercup.

03:24.639 --> 03:27.990
Why is it so important
to be thankful?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.949
[chuckles] Sunny and Petal,
why don't you go

03:30.993 --> 03:32.908

Chomps, the field mouse?

03:32.951 --> 03:34.823
I'm sure
he'll love to teach you two

03:34.866 --> 03:37.173

of being thankful.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.131
We will, Queen Buttercup.

03:39.175 --> 03:41.873
We'll go see Chomps right away.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.285
Hey, Chomps.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.244
Hi, Chomps.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.855
Hey, it's Sunny and Petal.

04:06.898 --> 04:09.466
What brings you this way?

04:09.510 --> 04:12.295
Bailey, the dog,
helped us find a field

04:12.339 --> 04:15.167
of clover
using his sense of smell.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.779
But we forgot to thank him.

04:17.822 --> 04:22.087
We're not even sure why
it's so bad that we forgot.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.786
Queen Buttercup said
you would explain to us

04:24.829 --> 04:27.223
the importance
of saying thank you.

04:27.267 --> 04:32.707
[chuckles] Well, Sunny
and Petal, if you'd like,
I'll tell you a story

04:32.750 --> 04:37.494
that will show you why it's
so important to be thankful.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.627
A story?

04:39.670 --> 04:43.979
Yes, a beautiful story
from the Bible.

04:44.022 --> 04:46.895
We would like that
very much, Chomps.

04:46.938 --> 04:52.204
Alright then,
this is how the story goes.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.598
[narrator] As Chomps
begins to tell the story,

04:54.642 --> 04:57.471
little Sunny
and Petal listen in,

04:57.514 --> 05:00.169
making sure they don't
miss a single word.

05:01.213 --> 05:06.218
Once Jesus entered a village
where he was met by ten lepers.

05:06.262 --> 05:10.222
The lepers called out,
"Jesus Master,

05:10.266 --> 05:15.358
have mercy on us."
When Jesus saw the poor men,

05:15.402 --> 05:20.407
he said to them: "Go and show
yourselves to the priests."

05:20.450 --> 05:23.714
And as they went
they were cleansed.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.587
Jesus helped them get well.

05:26.630 --> 05:31.548
He did.
When one of the cured men
saw that he was healed,

05:31.592 --> 05:35.422
he turned back, praising
God with a loud voice

05:35.465 --> 05:38.338
and he fell
on his face at Jesus' feet

05:38.381 --> 05:42.385
giving him thanks,
He was a Samaritan.

05:42.429 --> 05:46.563
Then Jesus answered,
"Were not ten cleansed?

05:46.607 --> 05:49.044
Where are the other nine?

05:49.087 --> 05:54.354
Was no one
found to return and give praise
to God except this foreigner?"

05:54.397 --> 05:59.271
Then he said to him:
"Rise and go your way,

05:59.315 --> 06:01.883
your faith has made you well."

06:01.926 --> 06:04.102
Wow, Chomps.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.496
What a wonderful story.

06:06.540 --> 06:11.762
Now, Sunny and Petal, which of
these men would you rather be?

06:11.806 --> 06:15.200
The one who went their way
or the one who remembered

06:15.244 --> 06:18.900
to turn around and
praise God for his help?

06:18.943 --> 06:23.426
Ah, Chomps, we want to be
like the one who turned around.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.733
The one who praised God.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.736
[chuckle]
I imagine so, little bees.

06:28.779 --> 06:33.654
Then go on now
and behave like good
little bees, good little bees

06:33.697 --> 06:39.050
who don't forget to give thanks
to their friends or to the Lord.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.966
We will, Chomps, thank you.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.752
Yes, thank you, Chomps.

06:44.795 --> 06:47.058
Let's go see Bailey.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.191

07:08.950 --> 07:13.694
We wanted to thank you
for helping us find
the field of clover today.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.827
Because of you, we'll
collect enough pollen

07:16.871 --> 07:20.614
to help feed our entire
hive all winter long.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.748
You're very welcome,

07:24.792 --> 07:29.100
We also want to thank God
for helping us too.

07:29.144 --> 07:33.496

friend like you, Bailey.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.847
Who helped us
find the clover field.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.502
That will
give us tons of pollen.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.026
To make lots of honey.

07:42.070 --> 07:45.552
To help feed the entire hive,
all winter long.

07:45.595 --> 07:51.209
Oh yes, little ones,
God is always there for you.

07:51.253 --> 07:56.040
Never forget
to give thanks to Him
for the blessings in your life.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.694
We won't.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.130

We'll never forget
to give thanks to God.

And to all those in our life who
help us, like Queen Buttercup.

08:07.225 --> 08:11.360
And Chomps, and you, Bailey.

08:11.403 --> 08:16.408
That's a wonderful thing you
learned today, little ones.

08:16.452 --> 08:22.240
And Speaking of help,
your thankfulness will
be rewarded, follow me.

08:24.329 --> 08:27.115

Thanks to their friend,
Bailey, Sunny and Petal

08:27.158 --> 08:29.987

another secret field.

08:30.031 --> 08:35.427
This time of alfalfa blossoms
and everybody knows

08:35.471 --> 08:38.909
bees love alfalfa blossoms.

08:38.953 --> 08:43.087
Well, Bailey, this is amazing.

Alfalfa blossoms.

08:45.568 --> 08:50.486
That's right, little ones.
You see, I was napping

08:50.530 --> 08:55.012
in the shade a little
while ago and the wind blew

08:55.056 --> 09:00.975
a whiff of the sweetest smelling
blossoms I ever did smell.

09:01.018 --> 09:04.631
You do have a great
sense of smell, Bailey.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.982
[chuckle] Yes, I sure do.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.985
-And you know what I thought?
-What?

09:11.028 --> 09:15.511
I thought,
"As soon as I see my good pals,
Sunny and Petal again,

09:15.555 --> 09:18.427
I'll tell
them about this field too."

09:18.470 --> 09:25.608
-Really?
-So after Chomps told us
that amazing Bible story.

09:25.652 --> 09:29.003
That taught us the importance
of being thankful.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.701
And we came to thank you.

09:31.745 --> 09:36.227
It was the perfect time
to show you this field too.

09:36.271 --> 09:40.667
Wow, so to be thankful
doesn't also feel great.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.366
But in the end,
you will be rewarded too.

09:44.409 --> 09:49.937
God always rewards those who
give thanks to Him, little ones.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.547

Queen Buttercup what
we've learned today.

Yes, Queen Buttercup. We visited
Chomps, just like you said.

10:20.794 --> 10:24.406
And he told us an amazing
story from the Bible.

10:24.449 --> 10:27.670

of being thankful.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.481
Why is friendship
so important, Queen?

13:50.525 --> 13:53.615
Friendship is the glue that
holds our world together, Petal.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.357
And just as importantly,
it's a gift from God.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.881
We'll do everything
in our power to help

13:58.925 --> 14:00.752
our friend in need,
Queen Buttercup.

14:00.796 --> 14:03.930
We'll go find Muffin
and Manny right away.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.715
Fly high, little ones,
there's not a moment to spare.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.721
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
fly to find Manny,

14:12.764 --> 14:18.422
help their friend Muffin,
and learn why friendship
is so important.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.337
Manny!

14:20.381 --> 14:23.558
We heard about Muffin,
is he okay?

14:23.601 --> 14:25.908
Hey, Sunny, Petal.

14:25.952 --> 14:29.564
Muffin's free from the mud
and he's okay.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.566
I just came from getting
him some water,

14:31.609 --> 14:34.917
for all this working his way
free, made him thirsty.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.050
Ah, good to hear he's okay.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.226
We came as fast as we could.

14:39.269 --> 14:42.055
As fast
as our wings would carry us.

14:42.098 --> 14:47.234
Wow, you
two bees sure are good friends
to a big old guy like Muffin.

14:47.277 --> 14:51.629
And so are you, Manny.
You got here before anyone.

14:51.673 --> 14:55.938
[chuckle] Well, I guess
you're right about that.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.027
She sure is.

14:58.071 --> 15:02.292
Friendship is so important
to our lives, yet it's one

15:02.336 --> 15:05.948
of the easiest things to
overlook when things get busy.

15:05.992 --> 15:09.082
Queen Buttercup was saying
the same thing earlier.

15:09.125 --> 15:13.913
We're lucky to have her too,
Queen Buttercup's one smart bee.

15:13.956 --> 15:17.612
But you know
some of the best lessons
we can learn on friendship

15:17.655 --> 15:19.309
are found in the Bible.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.964
Get out, can you tell us any?

15:22.008 --> 15:28.144
Sure, let me tell you
a very beautiful thing
Jesus told his disciples.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.973
[narrator] Sunny and Petal,
listen intently,

15:31.017 --> 15:36.109
as Manny
recounts his favorite story
of friendship from the Bible.

15:36.152 --> 15:40.765
Jesus said to his disciples:
"This is my commandment,

15:40.809 --> 15:44.682
that you love one another
as I have loved you.

15:44.726 --> 15:47.685
Greater love has no one
other than this,

15:47.729 --> 15:52.168
that someone lay down
his life for his friends."

15:52.212 --> 15:53.778
He said that?

15:53.822 --> 15:57.260
Jesus is so caring
and full of love.

15:57.304 --> 16:00.785
Yes, He loved His
disciples very much.

16:00.829 --> 16:06.226
And even though they saw
Him as Master, He treated
them as beloved friends.

16:06.269 --> 16:09.446
What else did Jesus
say to them, Manny?

16:09.490 --> 16:13.885
Jesus told His beloved
disciples: "You are My friends

16:13.929 --> 16:16.845
if you do as I command you."
Then he continued,

16:16.888 --> 16:19.282
"No longer
do I call you servants,

16:19.326 --> 16:22.242
for the servant, does not know
what his master is doing,

16:22.285 --> 16:25.201
but I have called you friends.

16:25.245 --> 16:29.466
For all that I've heard from my
Father, I've made known to you."

16:29.510 --> 16:34.036
So Jesus treated His
disciples like friends

16:34.080 --> 16:38.040
and not like servants, how come?

16:38.084 --> 16:42.740
Well, because they
simply learned to listen
to Him and to His teachings.

16:42.784 --> 16:46.483
They were able to quiet
their heart and simply listen.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.877
In doing so, they learned
from Him the teaching

16:48.920 --> 16:51.010
He received from God,
His Father.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.056
In that way,
they knew what He knew.

16:54.100 --> 16:58.626
And in His eyes,
they were as His friends.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.716
It would be a great gift
to be taught God's teaching,

17:01.759 --> 17:04.153
just like
the disciples were taught.

17:04.196 --> 17:08.462
How can we become
Jesus' friends, Manny?

17:08.505 --> 17:13.858
You simply listen to Jesus'
teachings and you do as He

17:13.902 --> 17:18.298
commands you, which is to love
one another as He loves you.

17:18.340 --> 17:21.779
Just as Jesus' capacity
for friendship and love

17:21.823 --> 17:27.742
-knows no boundaries,
so it should be for you.
-But how do we do that?

17:27.785 --> 17:32.138
Just the way you did when you
didn't hesitate to come
help a friend in trouble.

17:32.181 --> 17:35.793
It didn't matter to you where
it was or what you had to do,

17:35.837 --> 17:39.319
you based your decision
on compassion for that friend

17:39.362 --> 17:44.628
and then
acted accordingly, and that's
what friendship is all about.

17:44.672 --> 17:47.718
What a great story, Manny.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.851
Yeah, thanks, Manny.

17:49.894 --> 17:53.202
Let's go see Muffin
and make sure he's okay.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.813
Right, let's go.

17:55.857 --> 18:00.122
That's the spirit.
Follow me, I'll take you to him.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.865
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
fly to visit with Muffin

18:03.908 --> 18:06.389
to make sure he's okay.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.782
Muffin.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.393
We came as fast as we could.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.178
Are you okay?

18:12.221 --> 18:18.619
Sunny and Petal, what are you
bees doing all the way out here?

18:18.662 --> 18:20.882
We heard you needed us.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.579
And we're your friends.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.540
Shucks,
I don't know what to say.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.934
You don't have to say anything
to us, we want to help,

18:29.978 --> 18:33.721
and see you safe,
just because we care about you.

18:33.764 --> 18:37.986
Yeah, God gave us a great
friend in you, Muffin.

18:38.029 --> 18:41.642
We're so different,
some animals might

18:41.685 --> 18:44.079
wonder what little
bees have in common

18:44.123 --> 18:49.867
with a big guy like you,
but we don't need
to be the same to be friends.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.566
Right, what makes
us so different,

18:52.609 --> 18:55.482
is part of what makes
us such good friends.

18:55.525 --> 18:57.832
We appreciate you, Muffin.

18:57.875 --> 19:01.444
And we want to be your friends
for a long time to come.

19:01.488 --> 19:05.144
Yeah, we love you very much.

19:05.187 --> 19:08.886
Wow, you guys, thanks.

19:08.930 --> 19:13.456
-Don't mention it, big guy.
-Yeah, anytime.

19:13.500 --> 19:19.158
But don't
make it a habit of getting
into this kind of trouble, okay?

19:19.201 --> 19:20.855
For your own good.

19:20.898 --> 19:21.856
Right.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.249
Right.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.773
That's a great
lesson in friendship

19:25.816 --> 19:29.124
and an awesome thing
you've done today, bees,

19:29.168 --> 19:32.475
just wanting to take
care of a big old guy like me,

19:32.519 --> 19:34.477
without asking
anything in return.

19:34.521 --> 19:38.786
Oh, ho, ho.
But I have a reward for you.

19:38.829 --> 19:39.917
You do?

19:39.961 --> 19:42.964
I sure do, follow me.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.620
[narrator] Thanks to their
friend, Muffin,

19:46.663 --> 19:50.232
Sunny and Petal have discovered another secret field,

19:50.276 --> 19:56.282
with a sea
of colorful flowers
as far as their eyescan see,

19:56.325 --> 19:59.807
just overflowing
with a yummy pollen.

20:00.895 --> 20:04.986
Wow, Muffin this is amazing.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.555
I've never seen so
many flowers in one place.

20:08.598 --> 20:13.342
I had just found
this field on my morning
gallop and was headed back

20:13.386 --> 20:15.692
to tell you all
where to find it

20:15.736 --> 20:18.652
when I stepped in
that mud pit and got stuck.

20:18.695 --> 20:22.960
In by coming to help you,
we ended up finding it anyway.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.312
Funny how that works, huh?

20:26.355 --> 20:29.924
God, works in mysterious ways.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.883
Hey, it'll be dark soon,
let's collect as much

20:32.927 --> 20:35.973
pollen as we can carry
and get back to the hive.

20:36.017 --> 20:40.195
Right, Queen Buttercups
gonna be very happy.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.024
[music]

20:44.330 --> 20:48.029
[narrator]
Sunny and Petal returned to the hive to see Queen Buttercup

20:48.072 --> 20:51.989
and tell her all they've
learned about friendship.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.296
Sunny, Petal, you're back.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.125
Yes, Queen Buttercup.
We found Muffin,

20:57.168 --> 21:01.216
he was stuck in a mud pit,
but he's okay now.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.524
[chuckle] Even though
he kind of did it on his own.

21:04.567 --> 21:08.441
True but we lent lots
of support and made sure

21:08.484 --> 21:11.139
he knew he had friends
he could count on.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.620
Ah, that's amazing, little ones.

21:13.663 --> 21:18.189
And you'll never guess
what happened afterwards.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.322
[chuckle] What happened?

21:20.366 --> 21:23.107
Muffin led us to
a place he was coming to

21:23.151 --> 21:26.241
tell us about before
he slipped in the mud.

21:26.285 --> 21:31.246
And when we got there,
he showed us a whole new field

21:31.290 --> 21:35.598
of beautiful
pollen packed flowers.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.774
That's wonderful,
Sunny and Petal.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.907
I see that you've learned your
lesson about the importance

21:39.950 --> 21:42.997
of friendship and you were
rewarded for your kindness.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.304
Yes, Queen Buttercup.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.089
Our tummies will be
full of honey this winter.

21:48.132 --> 21:54.095
But what's more important,
our hearts will be
full of praise for God.

21:54.138 --> 21:59.318
Without Him,
none of these wonderful
things would be possible.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.450
And that's what matters most.

22:01.494 --> 22:05.019
[narrator] With a heart full
of gratitude and love for God,

22:05.062 --> 22:10.067
little Sunny and Petal,
head out for another
fun-filled adventure.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.983
Here we go, Petal.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.116
Let's go, Sunny.

22:15.159 --> 22:18.859
Woohoo!

22:18.902 --> 22:20.556
Yay.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.561
[birds twittering]

22:27.694 --> 22:30.131
[narrator] It's a beautiful
day in the country

22:30.174 --> 22:34.004
and little bees,
Sunny and Petal, are
flying back to their hive

22:34.048 --> 22:38.792
after a fun day distributing
pollen to hives in need.

22:38.835 --> 22:45.059
Petal, we sure did pass out
lots of yummy honey
to local hives today.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.888
Queen Buttercup
will be so proud of us, Sunny.

22:47.931 --> 22:50.891
She'll praise us for
our good deeds, I'm sure.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.068
[birds twittering]

22:57.811 --> 23:00.901
[narrator] Lo and behold,
here's Queen Buttercup

23:00.944 --> 23:04.339
waiting for the return
of her littlest ones.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.298
Sunny, Petal, welcome back.

23:07.342 --> 23:10.432
We distributed tons of pollen to

23:10.476 --> 23:12.739
the surrounding hives
today, Queen Buttercup.

23:12.782 --> 23:16.873
I feel like my little
wings might fall off.

23:16.917 --> 23:20.486
And we got tons of pollen
for our hive also.

23:20.529 --> 23:23.489
Great job, Sunny and Petal.
I'm sure the other bees

23:23.532 --> 23:26.013
are so very thankful
for your generosity.

23:26.056 --> 23:29.103
And we here at home appreciate
all your hard work too.

23:29.146 --> 23:35.588
-Thanks, Queen.
-Don't mention it, collecting
pollen is what us bees do best.

23:35.631 --> 23:39.330
It sounds like you collected
quite a bit. How in the world
did just find enough

23:39.374 --> 23:41.463
pollen to feed
our neighboring hives?

23:41.507 --> 23:44.814
Carlotta the cow, told us
about a brand new pasture

23:44.858 --> 23:47.208
where amazing flowers grow.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.515
Our good friend, Carlotta.

23:49.558 --> 23:53.693
She came across is grazing
one morning and thought of us.

23:53.736 --> 23:56.478
And when we saw it,
we realized there were

23:56.522 --> 23:59.612
so many flowers
and so much pollen,

23:59.655 --> 24:03.703
we just had to share and deliver
it to the other bees we know.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.227
We could've just told them
where to find it,

24:06.270 --> 24:08.447
but we were already there.

24:08.490 --> 24:12.363
It didn't seem like a big
deal to collect for others.

24:12.407 --> 24:16.890
Yeah, I mean worker bees
deserve to sleep in sometimes.

24:16.933 --> 24:20.067
[laughter]

24:20.110 --> 24:23.592
You have a point,
Sunny and Petal.
That's so nice of you both.

24:23.636 --> 24:27.596
You two possess unbelievable
strength for such young bees.

24:27.640 --> 24:33.515
Strength? I guess
it does take some muscles
to carry so much pollen.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.909
Yeah, stomach muscles.

24:35.952 --> 24:37.998
It really wasn't
that heavy, Queen.

24:38.041 --> 24:41.262
[chuckle]
That's not the strength
I'm referring to, Petal.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.917
Like the Bible teaches us,
"Real strength

24:43.960 --> 24:46.485
is found in serving,
not being served."

24:46.528 --> 24:50.401
-Wow, really?
-Really.

24:50.445 --> 24:56.016
So by giving pollen away
instead of just taking pollen,

24:56.059 --> 24:58.845
we got closer to God?

24:58.888 --> 25:02.022
Indeed, Sunny
and I'm so proud of you both.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.677
You've done such good today,
why don't you bees

25:04.720 --> 25:07.157
take the rest of the day
to play and be joyful?

25:07.201 --> 25:08.724
Okay.

25:08.768 --> 25:10.247
Okay.

25:10.291 --> 25:14.121
[music]

25:19.213 --> 25:22.346
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
run into their friend, Rita,

25:22.390 --> 25:25.524
the wisest frog
in all the woods.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.613
Hi, Rita.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.353
Long-time no see.

25:29.397 --> 25:32.400
Yeah, how goes it, Rita?

25:32.443 --> 25:35.142
I heard you got a new lily pad.

25:35.185 --> 25:39.494
I did, it's floating well.
How are you bees doing?

25:39.538 --> 25:44.804
-We're great.
-Yeah, we found a new pasture
this morning and distributed

25:44.847 --> 25:49.069
pollen to all the neighboring
beehives free of charge.

25:49.112 --> 25:54.857
Oh, wow, that was
so nice of you. I'm sure
those bees were very grateful.

25:54.901 --> 25:58.382
They certainly were,
and surprised too.

25:58.426 --> 26:02.386
I'll bet, it's not every day
that two little bees show up

26:02.430 --> 26:05.781
at someone else's hive to
give away precious pollen.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.828
It was pretty nice of us, huh?

26:08.871 --> 26:11.700
Queen Buttercup told us,
because of our actions,

26:11.744 --> 26:18.054
-we're very
strong little bees.
-We must be super-bees, Petal.

26:18.098 --> 26:22.363
[chuckle] Well, now little ones,
you should be

26:22.406 --> 26:24.931
careful of reveling
too much in pride.

26:24.974 --> 26:27.890
Whatever do you mean, Rita?

26:27.934 --> 26:30.719
Once, Jesus said
to his dinner host,

26:30.763 --> 26:34.070
"When you give
a dinner or a supper,
do not invite your friends

26:34.114 --> 26:36.725
or brothers or relatives
or rich neighbors,

26:36.769 --> 26:38.858
for they will
invite you in return

26:38.901 --> 26:41.643
and you will be repaid,
but when you give a feast,

26:41.687 --> 26:46.648
invite the poor, the crippled,
the lame, and the blind,
then you will be blessed,

26:46.692 --> 26:48.998
for they have
no way of repaying you.

26:49.042 --> 26:52.175
And you will be rewarded when
the upright rise from the dead.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.221
Do you know what Jesus meant?

26:54.264 --> 26:57.616
I think he's saying
we should give from our hearts

26:57.659 --> 27:03.273
because we want to, not because
we expect praise or reward

27:03.317 --> 27:06.668
or getting something
in return for our generosity.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.409
That's right, Petal.

27:08.452 --> 27:11.804
And God,
would rather we be humble,

27:11.847 --> 27:16.286
not proud about our
good deeds done in His name.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.027
Exactly, Sunny.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.508
To give,
it's a reward in itself.

27:20.551 --> 27:23.250
We should do
something nice for Carlotta,

27:23.293 --> 27:28.298
she showed us
the new pasture without
asking a thing in return.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.911
Right, but what can
two tiny bees,

27:31.954 --> 27:35.871
like us, do for
a big old cow like Carlotta?

27:35.915 --> 27:38.700
Don't let her hear you
call her that, Sunny.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.050
She's a girl, you know.

27:41.094 --> 27:44.532
[chuckle] Keep up
the good work, bee friends,

27:44.575 --> 27:47.100
I learned a lesson
from your kind deeds.

27:47.143 --> 27:49.624
And I'll fit my pond
with lily pads for everyone,

27:49.668 --> 27:53.236
then see
if any frogs would like to
come enjoy the water with me.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.674
That's awesome, Rita.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.894
Yeah, let us know how it goes.

27:58.938 --> 28:01.723
Maybe we'll come relax
on one sometime

28:01.767 --> 28:04.987
and bring Carlotta
to hang out on one of them.

28:05.031 --> 28:10.123
[chuckle] Oh well, better find
a big lily pad for her then.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.386
[chuckle] Bye, Rita.

28:12.429 --> 28:13.953
See you soon.

28:13.996 --> 28:16.172
[music]

28:16.216 --> 28:20.829
[narrator] Sunny and Petal fly back to see their friend, Carlotta the cow.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.483
Hey, Carlotta.

28:22.526 --> 28:26.661
Petal, Sunny, what brings
you guys back today?

28:26.705 --> 28:29.359
We just wanted to
thank you for showing us

28:29.403 --> 28:31.187
your new pasture
this morning.

28:31.231 --> 28:35.191
Those were more flowers
than we've ever seen.

28:35.235 --> 28:39.761
And our neighbor bees
were delighted by all
the pollen gifts we delivered.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.763
Isn't that wonderful?

28:41.807 --> 28:44.810
Now I'm happy
to have been of service, bees.

28:44.853 --> 28:48.770
-We'd like to give you
a gift as well, Carlotta.
-Me?

28:48.814 --> 28:51.468
No one's ever given
me a gift before.

28:51.512 --> 28:55.516
Well, we're about
to change all that.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.779
[narrator] Much to
Carlotta's surprise,

28:57.823 --> 29:01.957
Sunny and Petal have prepared
a little song for her.

29:02.001 --> 29:07.354
-Okay, Petal, are you ready?
-Ready?

29:07.397 --> 29:12.402
♪ Oh, Carlotta, she's so nice
And she's so kind ♪

29:12.446 --> 29:18.626
♪ She helped us find pollen
And she won't mind ♪

29:18.669 --> 29:23.674
♪ If we fly off and don't say
thank you' or even please ♪

29:23.718 --> 29:29.115
♪ Cause she's happy to give
That's how she is ♪

29:29.158 --> 29:33.641
Oh, you two have made a song
for me, thanks, you guys.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.382
That was so beautiful.

29:35.425 --> 29:38.777
You were so kind to us earlier,

29:38.820 --> 29:41.475
we wanted to do something
nice for you too.

29:41.518 --> 29:46.567
Oh, you shouldn't have,
all I did was
show you guys my pasture.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.525
That's not all you did,
Carlotta,

29:48.569 --> 29:51.354
you gave us
a tremendous gift

29:51.398 --> 29:54.662
and didn't
ask for a thing in return.

29:54.705 --> 29:58.797
Yeah, and as a result,
we were able to share pollen

29:58.840 --> 30:02.191
with each and
every bee around us.

30:02.235 --> 30:05.542
That was all because
of your generosity.

30:05.586 --> 30:08.763
You're so kind, Carlotta.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.592
We love you so much.

30:11.635 --> 30:15.204
What did I ever do to
have such giving friends?

30:15.248 --> 30:20.949
You've always
been good to us, Carlotta,
kindness comes back around.

30:20.993 --> 30:25.214
You guys come back
and see me again soon.
I'll be easy to find.

30:25.258 --> 30:31.394
-Just look for a cow
with a big dreamy smile.
-[laughter]

30:33.005 --> 30:35.181
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
returned to the hive

30:35.224 --> 30:38.967
to see Queen Buttercup and tell her all they've learned

30:39.011 --> 30:43.624
about giving without
expecting nothing in return.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.888
Sunny, Petal,
did you find Carlotta the cow?

30:46.932 --> 30:49.195
We sure did, Queen.

30:49.238 --> 30:54.069
And we gave her
a gift of a soooong.

30:54.113 --> 30:58.073
Our own special song
we made just for her.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.989
Oh my, I bet she was overjoyed.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.948
She sure was.

31:02.991 --> 31:06.255
The look
on her face was priceless.

31:06.299 --> 31:10.433
And fulfilling
God's plan for us was even
more priceless, wasn't it?

31:10.477 --> 31:13.393
-Yeah.
-Yes.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.221
Serving others
without being asked,

31:15.264 --> 31:18.006
rewards our souls
in ways we never imagined.

31:18.050 --> 31:20.966
See God created us
to be good to one another

31:21.009 --> 31:24.752
and when we
exercise His plan, we feel
better about ourselves.

31:24.795 --> 31:27.537
Wow, I understand.

31:27.581 --> 31:30.758
Yeah, that's amazing.

31:30.801 --> 31:34.066
God sure is great,
Queen Buttercup.

31:34.109 --> 31:37.286
[chuckles] That He is,
Sunny, that He is.

31:37.330 --> 31:42.248
-Let's go think of something
nice to do tomorrow.
-Yeah.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.773
I'm so proud of you, my little
bees, now get your rest.

31:45.816 --> 31:49.646
I'm certain tomorrow will
be just as magical as today.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.822
Hooray!

31:51.866 --> 31:53.737
Praise God.

31:54.651 --> 31:58.394
[narrator] With hearts full of
gratitude and love for God,

31:58.438 --> 32:04.183
little Sunny and Petal
fly high to be of the best
service they can be.

32:04.226 --> 32:06.185
Time to serve, Petal.

32:06.228 --> 32:07.795
Let's go, Sunny.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.101
Yeah.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.841
Woohoo.

32:10.885 --> 32:13.975
[jolly music]

32:14.889 --> 32:19.894
Today was such a fun day, Sunny,
I loved playing in the field.

32:19.938 --> 32:24.986
It sure is a nice break
from collecting pollen,
I'll say that.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.684
But we didn't get
a lot of pollen today,

32:27.728 --> 32:30.426
do you think
Queen Buttercup will be upset

32:30.470 --> 32:33.038
that we're
coming back empty-handed?

32:33.081 --> 32:38.217
Hm, nah, we'll just
tell her there wasn't much

32:38.260 --> 32:41.916
pollen to be found,
it's a windy day after all.

32:41.960 --> 32:47.530
We'll say it just blew away
before we could snag any.

32:47.574 --> 32:53.667
-Or, we could say it was too
windy to land on any flowers.
-Yeah.

32:53.710 --> 32:58.019
Then we'll make sure
to collect extra pollen
tomorrow, to make up for it.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.455
Agreed.

32:59.499 --> 33:02.458
[jolly music]

33:06.071 --> 33:10.249
[narrator]
And here is Queen Buttercup,
the leader of the colony.

33:10.292 --> 33:14.818
She rules the hive with
firm, but gentle wings.

33:14.862 --> 33:18.257
Sunny, Petal,
what have you bees been up to?

33:18.300 --> 33:20.172
Are you done collecting
pollen for the day?

33:20.215 --> 33:24.393
Well, we had
a hard time, Queen Buttercup,

33:24.437 --> 33:28.093
it's so windy out.

33:28.136 --> 33:32.619
We could hardly land on a flower
petal to grab any pollen at all.

33:32.662 --> 33:38.059
We'll make extra sure
we collect more pollen
tomorrow to make up for it.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.888
My little bees,
our other workers informed me

33:40.931 --> 33:43.108
that you were playing
in the field all day long.

33:43.151 --> 33:46.807
-Oh.
-Oh.

33:46.850 --> 33:50.898
I'm so disappointed
that you two decided
to lie to me about your day.

33:50.941 --> 33:53.596
I think you two
are great little worker bees

33:53.640 --> 33:57.470
and sometimes
even great worker bees
need a little time to play.

33:57.513 --> 34:00.212
I would've understood
if you had told me the truth,

34:00.255 --> 34:04.129
but now
I'm sad to see I can't always
trust what you tell me.

34:04.172 --> 34:08.742
Oh, Queen Buttercup,
we're so sorry.

34:08.784 --> 34:12.833
Yeah, we didn't mean
to lie, Queen, honest.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.444
I know you didn't,
you two have always

34:15.487 --> 34:17.664
been among
our colony's nicest bees.

34:17.706 --> 34:20.319
I just don't know what
got into you this time.

34:20.362 --> 34:23.103
You spent the day playing
and then lied about it.

34:23.148 --> 34:26.237
Oh,
I feel terrible.

34:26.281 --> 34:32.940
So do I,
I didn't mean to let myself
and everyone around me down.

34:32.983 --> 34:40.034
[crying] I didn't mean to hurt
anybody, Queen Buttercuuuup.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.907
[crying] Me neither.

34:43.951 --> 34:46.693
That's what dishonesty
and lying do, little bees,

34:46.735 --> 34:50.304
they hurt us, as well as
the ones we try to deceive.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.568
We understand that now.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.049
I can see this makes
you feel terrible,

34:55.092 --> 34:58.270
so I will forgive you two,
but I'd like it very much

34:58.313 --> 35:00.272
if you got together with
your hive-mate, Lanny.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.317
He can perhaps shed
some light on the power

35:02.361 --> 35:04.580
of moral purity and
a clear conscience.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.192
My little bees,
you feel badly for a reason.

35:07.235 --> 35:10.586
If you're truly sorry, this
can be a lesson well learned.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.459
We'll go right now, Queen.

35:13.502 --> 35:16.940
Yes, we want to make it right.

35:16.984 --> 35:19.029
Go on then, my Sunny and Petal.

35:19.073 --> 35:20.901
I'll speak to you both
when you return.

35:23.991 --> 35:27.386
[narrator] Sunny and Petal fly to meet up with Lanny, the bee,

35:27.429 --> 35:33.392
to learn why moral purity
and a clear conscience
are so important.

35:33.435 --> 35:38.658
Hi, Lanny, I don't know
if you've heard.

35:38.701 --> 35:42.444
About you guys lying
to Queen Buttercup?

35:42.488 --> 35:44.751
Yeah, I heard about it.

35:44.794 --> 35:50.191
Oh great, now the whole hive
will think we can't be trusted.

35:50.235 --> 35:53.977
Well, you did tell a lie.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.849
But we didn't mean it.

35:55.892 --> 35:59.331
We usually work hard every day.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.203
It's not like
we lie all the time.

36:02.247 --> 36:06.773
Yeah, we just started playing
and lost track of time.

36:06.816 --> 36:10.385
And we didn't want the Queen
to think we were lazy.

36:10.429 --> 36:13.214
But you were lazy.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.216
I know but--

36:15.260 --> 36:19.046
Wouldn't it have been better
to fess up and tell the truth?

36:19.089 --> 36:21.309
Just say
that you made a mistake?

36:21.353 --> 36:23.355
Yes.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.574
Yes.

36:25.618 --> 36:28.186
Remember that through God,

36:28.229 --> 36:31.885
confession makes
all forgiveness possible,

36:31.928 --> 36:38.326
for the Lord said: "Happy is
the man who follows not
the counsel of the wicked,

36:38.370 --> 36:43.331
nor takes his stand
with sinners, nor sits
among the scoffers

36:43.375 --> 36:47.074
but delights in
the law of the Lord.

36:47.117 --> 36:50.251
And day and night
he meditates on it

36:50.295 --> 36:55.125
for he is like a tree
planted by streams of water

36:55.169 --> 36:58.041
which yields its fruit
in due season,

36:58.085 --> 37:03.612
whose leaf never withers,
and all that he does prospers."

37:03.656 --> 37:05.266
He said that?

37:05.310 --> 37:10.358
Yes, but He also said:
"Not so the wicked.

37:10.402 --> 37:14.057
They are like
the chaff driven by the wind

37:14.101 --> 37:17.191
so the wicked shall
not rise up at the judgment,

37:17.235 --> 37:19.976
nor sinners where
the righteous are gathered,

37:20.020 --> 37:24.067
for the Lord directs
the way of the righteous

37:24.111 --> 37:28.115
but the way of
the wicked leads to ruin."

37:28.158 --> 37:29.986
God, said that?

37:30.030 --> 37:32.728
Oh boy, we are in trouble.

37:32.772 --> 37:35.514
[laughs]

37:35.557 --> 37:41.737
Well, here's always a way
to get things right in
the eyes of God, little ones.

37:41.781 --> 37:48.483
-There is?
-Why don't you guys go see our
old friend the gentle Daffodil?

37:48.527 --> 37:52.574
I bet he'll have some kind
of words of advice for you.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.838
Up, up and away.

38:00.278 --> 38:05.370
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
fly to see their good friend,
Daffodil, the bull.

38:07.546 --> 38:11.463
Hey, Daffodil.
How's it mooing?

38:12.464 --> 38:17.947
It's mooooing okay, little bees.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.254
Long-time no see.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.082
Long time.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.998
Daffodil, we have
done something bad

38:25.041 --> 38:27.435
and Lanny sent us
to talk with you.

38:27.479 --> 38:32.005
Yeah, he hopes you can help
us get right with God.

38:32.048 --> 38:35.791
Oh-oh, sure, what's going on?

38:35.835 --> 38:41.101
Well, Sunny and I,
we kind of... um--

38:41.144 --> 38:43.843
We blew off our
pollen collecting duties

38:43.886 --> 38:47.412
and then lied about it
to Queen Buttercup.

38:47.455 --> 38:51.416
Geeze, you make us sound so bad.

38:51.459 --> 38:55.724
We were bad, Petal,
I can see that now.

38:55.768 --> 39:00.729
Oh my, I always thought
you two were good little bees.

39:00.773 --> 39:05.386
See, our reputation
is going to be mud from now on.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.911
Well, that isn't
necessarily so, Petal.

39:08.955 --> 39:12.698
While Sunny's right,
what you two did was wrong,

39:12.741 --> 39:15.962
the great thing
about our faith is that God,

39:16.005 --> 39:19.487
in His infinite wisdom,
forgives.

39:19.531 --> 39:23.752
Even for two lying bees who
don't deserve a second chance?

39:23.796 --> 39:26.668
[laughing] Oh, Petal.

39:26.712 --> 39:33.414
In God's eyes
we all deserve and get
a second chance if we want one.

39:33.458 --> 39:38.463
"God blesses
the home of him who does right."
So it says in the Bible.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.769
Surely, He scoffs
at the scoffers,

39:40.813 --> 39:45.208
but to the modest,
He ever shows favor.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.819
Wow.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.516
Wow.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.563
Now why don't
you bees follow me?

39:51.606 --> 39:54.957
I have something
I think you'd like to see.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.658
[narrator] As a result
of their genuine sorrow

39:59.701 --> 40:02.312
and regret
for the mistake they made,

40:02.356 --> 40:08.841
Daffodil and Bull
leads the little bees to a pollen packed field of flowers.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.712
Here you go, bees.

40:10.756 --> 40:14.368
This field has been
untouched all week.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.806
These flowers should be
chock full of yummy pollen.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.853
No way, can we take some?

40:20.896 --> 40:24.900
You can take
all that you can carry.

40:24.944 --> 40:27.468
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

40:27.512 --> 40:32.342
I can clearly see
that you two regret
the choice you made earlier

40:32.386 --> 40:34.867
and that your
dishonest actions are

40:34.910 --> 40:37.522
weighing heavily
on your little wings.

40:37.565 --> 40:39.349
Yes, they do.

40:39.393 --> 40:43.310
Well, don't worry little bees,

40:43.353 --> 40:47.270
God forgives you
and he welcomes your honesty.

40:47.314 --> 40:50.491
Oh, Daffodil,
we can't thank you enough.

40:50.535 --> 40:53.625
We'll be honest
and upstanding from now on.

40:53.668 --> 40:56.497
Always in His name.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.151
That's a promise.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.849
I feel so relieved.

41:00.893 --> 41:06.942
-I'll tell you, Petal,
this beats lying anytime.
-Sure does.

41:06.986 --> 41:11.512
Lying feels grummy, but having
a clear conscience feels great.

41:11.556 --> 41:14.123
[music]

41:14.167 --> 41:17.866
[narrator]
Sunny and Petal returned to the hive to see Queen Buttercup

41:17.910 --> 41:20.434
and tell her all
they've learned about

41:20.478 --> 41:23.785
moral purity
and clear consciences.

41:23.829 --> 41:28.007
Well, did you learn anything
valuable today, my sweet bees?

41:28.050 --> 41:30.270
We sure did, Queen Buttercup.

41:30.313 --> 41:34.579
We learned that moral purity
and a clean conscience

41:34.622 --> 41:37.538
are both more
important than we know.

41:37.582 --> 41:43.152
They're the best way
to honor ourselves,
our loved ones, and God.

41:43.196 --> 41:46.286
Sunny, Petal,
I'm so proud of you two.

41:46.329 --> 41:48.723
You've shown you
can learn from your mistakes

41:48.767 --> 41:51.247
and be better
bees because of them.

41:51.291 --> 41:56.601
We understand now, Queen,
and we won't make
the same mistake again.

41:56.644 --> 42:03.303
-Oh, and we have a little
surprise for the hive.
-A surprise?

42:03.346 --> 42:06.567
Yes, after we
told Daffodil what we did

42:06.611 --> 42:12.312
and how sorry we were
about it, he led us to
a flower field full of pollen.

42:12.355 --> 42:18.405
-We collected our pollen for
the day and then some.
-How wonderful.

42:18.448 --> 42:22.191
See the blessed things
that can occur when
we follow the Lord's plan.

42:22.235 --> 42:24.019
We do, Queen.

42:24.063 --> 42:26.718
We'll never stray again, Queen.

42:26.761 --> 42:29.372
We love you and we love God too.

42:29.416 --> 42:33.246
-You can count on us.
-Oh, my lovely little bees.

42:33.289 --> 42:37.293
You've made me very proud
today, very proud indeed.

42:37.337 --> 42:39.818
[jolly music]

42:39.861 --> 42:42.995
[narrator]
Buzzing full of gratitude
with love for God,

42:43.038 --> 42:48.740
little Sunny and Petal
head out with clear
consciousness and pure hearts.

42:48.783 --> 42:52.004
Oh, I feel great, Petal.

42:52.047 --> 42:53.919
So do I, Sunny.

42:53.962 --> 42:56.095
Praise God.

42:56.138 --> 42:57.662
Wohoo!

43:04.582 --> 43:07.280
[narrator] It's a warm and
sunny day in the country

43:07.323 --> 43:10.283
and little bees Sunny
and Petal are flying back

43:10.326 --> 43:12.067
to their brand new beehive

43:12.111 --> 43:16.289
after a forest fire
destroyed their old one.

43:16.332 --> 43:18.291
Sunny, we did it.

43:18.334 --> 43:20.641
All of us bees
banded together today

43:20.685 --> 43:23.775
and built ourselves
a brand new hive.

43:23.818 --> 43:30.564
Bee power!
No nasty old forest fire can
keep our colony down, Petal.

43:30.608 --> 43:34.089
Us bees will always rise.

43:34.133 --> 43:36.657
Go, Bee Team [laughs].

43:36.701 --> 43:38.703
[laugh]

43:45.057 --> 43:48.582
[narrator] And here is
the famous Queen Buttercup.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.629
Her colony has seen
peril more than once

43:51.672 --> 43:53.631
during her ten years as leader,

43:53.674 --> 43:56.938
but just like always,
she guides her bees

43:56.982 --> 43:59.549
through troubles
with faith and grace.

44:00.420 --> 44:02.727
Hi, Queen Buttercup.

44:02.770 --> 44:08.646
-Hey, Queen.
-Sunny, Petal, I want to commend
you on a job well done today.

44:08.689 --> 44:11.779
I'm so, so proud of you
my little hard workers.

44:11.823 --> 44:13.694
Praise be to God
that we're blessed

44:13.738 --> 44:16.218
with young bees
as reliable as you two.

44:16.262 --> 44:22.268
[laughs] Flattery will
get you everywhere, Queen.

44:23.182 --> 44:30.406
No need to thank us.
We're honored to serve you,
our Queen and God, our creator.

44:30.450 --> 44:33.540
Oh, my wonderful, little ones
you should think about

44:33.583 --> 44:35.542
teaching a Sunday class
in the new hive

44:35.585 --> 44:38.588
for even littler ones,
they could learn
a thing or two

44:38.632 --> 44:40.460
from your
resilience and resolve.

44:40.503 --> 44:42.984
Hmm, maybe we will.

44:43.028 --> 44:46.422
It'll be a privilege
to help guide small bees.

44:46.466 --> 44:51.514
Yeah, and we could give
them lots of homework
to keep them occupied.

44:51.558 --> 44:55.693
[laughs] Now, now, Sunny,
let's not get carried away.

44:55.736 --> 44:57.912
You've learned a very
important lesson today.

44:57.956 --> 45:00.393
With the unfortunate
loss of our old hive,

45:00.436 --> 45:02.047
we could have
given up and scattered

45:02.090 --> 45:04.440
our colony to the wind,
but we didn't.

45:04.484 --> 45:05.790
No way.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.748
We love our colony.

45:07.792 --> 45:11.534
We all do, Petal, but love
sometimes is not enough for

45:11.578 --> 45:14.276
creatures to bounce back
from misfortune and failure.

45:14.320 --> 45:17.105
Sometimes faith and
perseverance are required

45:17.149 --> 45:19.455
to regain what we had
before our hardship.

45:19.499 --> 45:24.591
I see.
We had faith that we could
keep our colony together

45:24.634 --> 45:28.508
and we persevered in building
our new home quickly.

45:28.551 --> 45:32.860
And now we're stronger
than we were before the fire.

45:32.904 --> 45:36.081
Exactly and part of exercising
strength is helping

45:36.124 --> 45:38.474
others who've been
subjected to misfortune.

45:38.518 --> 45:41.390
Our friend Butterbean
is also having difficulty

45:41.434 --> 45:43.610
as his barn burned
in the forest fire.

45:43.653 --> 45:47.309
Oh no, we need to check on him.

45:47.353 --> 45:50.835
Yeah, we need to find him
and make sure he's okay.

45:50.878 --> 45:53.968
That's the spirit.
Godspeed, my little ones.

45:54.012 --> 45:57.580
I look forward to hearing how
Butterbean handled his bad luck.

45:57.624 --> 46:00.061
[music]

46:06.285 --> 46:09.288
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
fly to meet up with Hoothoot

46:09.331 --> 46:12.247
who can lead then
to Butterbean's barn.

46:12.291 --> 46:15.816
Hoothoot, did you hear
about Butterbean?

46:15.860 --> 46:17.339
I did.

46:17.383 --> 46:18.863
Have you spoken to him?

46:18.906 --> 46:20.473
Is he okay?

46:20.516 --> 46:23.955
He's feeling down right now,
but his faith is strong.

46:23.998 --> 46:26.696
Well, faith is half the battle.

46:26.740 --> 46:27.915
Let's go see him.

46:27.959 --> 46:30.265
Maybe we can help his mindset.

46:30.309 --> 46:33.660
Or maybe
we can help him rebuild.

46:33.703 --> 46:35.880
Us bees never quit.

46:35.923 --> 46:38.578
Go, Bee Team [laughs].

46:38.621 --> 46:41.624
I'm sure Butterbean
will be happy to see you two.

46:41.668 --> 46:44.497
But how do we find him,
Hoothoot?

46:44.540 --> 46:48.631
Easy, just follow the sun all
the way to Marsh-Marsh pond,

46:48.675 --> 46:51.939
then take a sharp right and
voilà, you'll find Butterbean.

46:51.983 --> 46:53.767
That's his favorite spot.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.290
That's where he goes to relax.

46:55.334 --> 46:57.989
Alright, let's go.

46:58.032 --> 47:01.731
[music]

47:01.775 --> 47:05.692
[narrator]
Sunny and Petal beat their
little wings ever so quickly

47:05.735 --> 47:09.435
to go see their good
friend Butterbean the pig.

47:09.478 --> 47:14.179
Butterbean, we're so sorry
to hear about your barn.

47:14.222 --> 47:17.095
We lost our hive.

47:17.138 --> 47:22.448
But we rebuilt and now our
hive is bigger and better.

47:22.491 --> 47:26.060
Oh, that's nice.

47:26.104 --> 47:27.888
I'm happy for you, guys.

47:27.932 --> 47:31.587
Hey, Butterbean,
don't be so sad.

47:31.631 --> 47:33.328
It's not so bad.

47:33.372 --> 47:37.332
You still have your health
and we're still your friends.

47:37.376 --> 47:39.857
And God still loves you.

47:39.900 --> 47:45.253
For sure. We can always
count on Him, no matter what.

47:45.297 --> 47:47.734
Through good times and bad.

47:47.777 --> 47:49.910
Especially bad.

47:49.954 --> 47:51.520
So I hear.

47:51.564 --> 47:55.133
I love my barn,
it was all I had.

47:55.176 --> 48:02.923
Oh, come on, Butterbean.
Cheer up buddy, it isn't so
bad that it can't be fixed.

48:02.967 --> 48:06.709
Petal's right, Butterbean.
Overcoming great difficulties

48:06.753 --> 48:10.235
is but one
of the gifts God has given us.

48:10.278 --> 48:14.108
And with faith in Him,
we can find the strength needed

48:14.152 --> 48:18.243
to bounce back after
failure or misfortune.

48:18.286 --> 48:19.331
Yeah?

48:19.374 --> 48:20.854
How so?

48:20.898 --> 48:23.248
We can tell you
a story, Butterbean.

48:23.291 --> 48:27.861
I think it will explain what
we mean much better than two

48:27.905 --> 48:32.213
little bees like us ever
could with all our buzzing.

48:32.257 --> 48:33.562
What do you say?

48:33.606 --> 48:36.174
Oh well, alright.

48:36.217 --> 48:41.527
Once upon a time, a great fire
destroyed all of Jerusalem.

48:41.570 --> 48:43.224
Oh no!

48:43.268 --> 48:45.574
Unfortunately, yes.

48:45.618 --> 48:48.751
So deciding to rebuild
the city's great wall,

48:48.795 --> 48:52.930
God's people were widely
ridiculed and disparaged,

48:52.973 --> 48:57.369
but after 52 days,
the new wall was finished.

48:57.412 --> 49:01.416
Nations around the world
watched in awe and fear

49:01.460 --> 49:06.769
for they knew
the power of God had a hand
in Jerusalem's rebuilding.

49:06.813 --> 49:08.989
Wow!

49:09.033 --> 49:13.689
In time, through God's grace,
Jerusalem was restored

49:13.733 --> 49:18.433
to a place even greater
than its former glory.

49:18.477 --> 49:24.787
Then the singers
sang loudly and the people
offered many sacrifices

49:24.831 --> 49:30.576
that day and rejoiced
for God had given them
great cause for joy.

49:30.619 --> 49:33.361
The women and children
rejoiced too

49:33.405 --> 49:39.367
so that the cries of joy at
Jerusalem were heard far away.

49:39.411 --> 49:42.762
Double wow, I'm inspired.

49:42.805 --> 49:45.547
Now that's
how we handle failure.

49:45.591 --> 49:48.681
But then how can
I rebuild my barn?

49:48.724 --> 49:54.774
I'm just one pig, one lonely,
roly-poly, chubby little pig.

49:54.817 --> 49:58.647
Hey, don't talk about yourself
like that, Butterbean.

49:58.691 --> 50:01.737
We are all
perfect in God's eyes.

50:01.781 --> 50:05.741
He made us for a reason
and we possess all the tools

50:05.785 --> 50:08.918
we need for our own success.

50:08.962 --> 50:12.705
Why don't we
go find the materials
to rebuild, Butterbean?

50:12.748 --> 50:16.839
There's no sense
standing around crying
about things that happened.

50:16.883 --> 50:19.712
Springing into action
will make you feel better

50:19.755 --> 50:24.238
and it's also the best way to
honor God's investment in us.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.460
Okay, if you think so.

50:28.503 --> 50:31.289
[jolly music]

50:31.332 --> 50:34.031
[narrator] Butterbean goes
along with Sunny and Petal

50:34.074 --> 50:36.946
in an effort to
feel better about things.

50:36.990 --> 50:39.862
It doesn't happen right away,
but when it does,

50:39.906 --> 50:43.083
he starts feeling
better and better.

50:43.127 --> 50:46.391
Alright, Butterbean,
you can collect some timber

50:46.434 --> 50:50.177
and we will glue it together
using some of our bee wax.

50:50.221 --> 50:55.487
-We're going to build
a cute little barn for you.
-We will?

50:55.530 --> 50:59.882
Yes, having faith and working
hard towards your goal

50:59.926 --> 51:03.582
helps you achieve anything
you set your mind to.

51:03.625 --> 51:09.849
It sure does and when we
use the gifts He's given us,
God smiles on us too.

51:09.892 --> 51:16.682
-You know, guys, I can see now
everything is going to be okay.
-Yes.

51:16.725 --> 51:22.731
And maybe it can be
an even better barn than
your old one, like our hive.

51:22.775 --> 51:26.518
We lost everything,
rolled with the punches,

51:26.561 --> 51:31.000
and rolled up our sleeves,
and came back even stronger.

51:31.044 --> 51:35.135
Sometimes God lets things happen
for a reason, Butterbean.

51:35.179 --> 51:38.269
And while it may not
be apparent at that time,

51:38.312 --> 51:41.620
there's a valuable
lesson waiting for us.

51:41.663 --> 51:45.102
You know I think you bees
are right, maybe this new barn

51:45.145 --> 51:49.193
will be better for me
and all the other pigs too.

51:49.236 --> 51:52.457
By my calculations, the square
footage of some of the timber

51:52.500 --> 51:57.244
I saw lying around is three
times the size of my old place.

51:57.288 --> 51:59.290
You'll have
more room to stretch out

51:59.333 --> 52:02.858
and you'll be able
to house more of your buddies.

52:02.902 --> 52:05.687
I do love company, yay.

52:05.731 --> 52:07.733
Thanks for
stopping by, you guys.

52:07.776 --> 52:09.909
I don't know what
I'd have done without you,

52:09.952 --> 52:12.433
I was really down in the dumps.

52:12.477 --> 52:16.611
Which isn't a bad place
for a pig to be generally.

52:16.655 --> 52:18.439
A different kind of dumps.

52:18.483 --> 52:20.528
[laughter]

52:20.572 --> 52:21.703
Got you.

52:21.747 --> 52:24.489
[music]

52:24.532 --> 52:28.406
[narrator] Sunny and
Petal returned to the hive
to see Queen Buttercup

52:28.449 --> 52:32.975
and tell her all they've learned about dealing with adversity.

52:33.019 --> 52:34.368
Hi, Queen.

52:34.412 --> 52:37.110
Petal, Sunny,
you're back so soon.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.155
How did it go?

52:38.198 --> 52:39.939
Wonderfully, Queen.

52:39.982 --> 52:42.898
We helped Butterbean
build a brand new barn

52:42.942 --> 52:45.640
and it's bigger
than his last one.

52:45.684 --> 52:51.646
It was great.
22 new pigs came to check it out
and they all fit inside.

52:51.690 --> 52:56.042
22? That's so nice.
I bet they're over the moon.

52:56.085 --> 53:01.526
No, those are cows that
jump over the moon, Queen.

53:01.569 --> 53:04.659
We also learned quite
a bit about dealing

53:04.703 --> 53:07.619
with life
surprises and failures.

53:07.662 --> 53:09.447
Really? Do tell.

53:09.490 --> 53:12.406
Well, Jerusalem wasn't
built in a day,

53:12.450 --> 53:14.495
but it was
destroyed in a day

53:14.539 --> 53:18.195
and with everyone's dedication,
vigilance, and hard work,

53:18.238 --> 53:21.198
the citizens went to work
and rebuilt the city.

53:21.241 --> 53:23.939
And It was
even better than before.

53:23.983 --> 53:26.812
Life might knock us
down a time or two

53:26.855 --> 53:29.162
but God has instilled
in each one of us

53:29.206 --> 53:33.166
the strength and
knowledge to pick
ourselves up and keep going.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.734
And It's in those
challenging times

53:35.777 --> 53:39.259
that we learn more
about ourselves and Him.

53:39.303 --> 53:41.696
Making us stronger

53:41.740 --> 53:43.524
and better prepared.

53:43.568 --> 53:45.918
And wiser.

53:45.961 --> 53:51.053
[laughs] I'm so, so proud of
you, Sunny and Petal, as always.

53:51.097 --> 53:53.142
[jolly music]

53:56.581 --> 53:59.410
[narrator] Full of gratitude
and love for God,

53:59.453 --> 54:05.851
little Sunny and Petal
go forth ready for anything
the day holds in store.

54:05.894 --> 54:08.114
Let's fly.

54:08.157 --> 54:12.161
Success is great,
but failure is not scary, Petal.

54:12.205 --> 54:14.642
No shame in our game, Sunny.

54:14.686 --> 54:16.470
Amen.

54:16.514 --> 54:18.080
Amen.

54:18.124 --> 54:20.692
[music]

54:24.609 --> 54:27.046
[narrator] It's another
great day in the country

54:27.089 --> 54:31.311
and little bees
Sunny and Petal
are flying back to their hive

54:31.355 --> 54:35.837
after helping
other worker bees
build their own hive.

54:35.881 --> 54:39.537
Sunny, it feels so good
to help other bees.

54:39.580 --> 54:44.063
With our
population numbers still
declining all over the world,

54:44.106 --> 54:47.458
us bees need
all the help we can get.

54:47.501 --> 54:50.896
That's true, Petal
and it doesn't take much

54:50.939 --> 54:53.507
to help others
and have a positive effect.

54:53.551 --> 54:56.249
Just say you'll do it
and keep your word.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.206
Easy.

54:57.250 --> 54:59.208
I know, right?

54:59.252 --> 55:02.560
Come on, let's see
what the Queen's up to today.

55:02.603 --> 55:04.866
[jolly music]

55:08.914 --> 55:11.525
[narrator] Don't look now,
it's Queen Buttercup,

55:11.569 --> 55:16.922
the widely
loved and revered leader
of Sunny and Petal's hive.

55:16.965 --> 55:19.881
Hey, Queen Buttercup,
how are things?

55:19.925 --> 55:23.189
Honestly, they've
been better, Sunny.

55:23.232 --> 55:26.584
Oh no, what's wrong, my Queen?

55:26.627 --> 55:30.544
It's Cluckity Cluck,
she promised Bailey
she'd play with him today.

55:30.588 --> 55:32.459
You know
how they both like to run.

55:32.503 --> 55:36.376
Anyway, she hasn't been around
and poor Bailey is very upset.

55:36.420 --> 55:38.683
What do you think happened?

55:38.726 --> 55:40.728
Is Cluckity sick?

55:40.772 --> 55:43.601
No, she's fine
as far as I know, Petal.

55:43.644 --> 55:49.258
Huh, why do you think she would
leave old Bailey in the lurch?

55:49.302 --> 55:51.565
I think she just forgot, Sunny.

55:51.609 --> 55:55.439
Forgot?
That sure seems inconsiderate.

55:55.482 --> 55:59.225
Yeah, sounds like Bailey
had his heart set on it.

55:59.268 --> 56:01.662
He did, Petal, he really did.

56:01.706 --> 56:03.534
Alas, it didn't happen.

56:03.577 --> 56:05.362
Maybe she's on her way.

56:05.405 --> 56:07.407
She ran late or something.

56:07.451 --> 56:09.322
The day is almost over now.

56:09.366 --> 56:11.324
It'll be dark soon
and the chickens will settle

56:11.368 --> 56:14.327
into their coops
for the night. Oh well.

56:14.371 --> 56:17.330
Maybe we can find
Cluckity Cluck, Queen.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.985
We'll get to the bottom
of this and see what happened.

56:20.028 --> 56:24.032
Maybe Bailey can still get
some good playing in
today after all.

56:24.076 --> 56:29.690
Would you? Oh my noble
little bees, I know it would
mean so much to Bailey.

56:29.734 --> 56:31.431
We're on it.

56:31.475 --> 56:33.041
Away we go.

56:33.085 --> 56:35.174
[music]

56:42.399 --> 56:46.185
[narrator] Sunny and Petal fly double-time to find Bailey the dog,

56:46.228 --> 56:49.971
who's still smarting
from his ignored play date.

56:50.015 --> 56:51.799
Hi, Bailey.

56:51.843 --> 56:54.498
Hey, Bailey,
how goes it, buddy?

56:54.541 --> 56:56.848
Uh, not great.

56:57.849 --> 56:59.720
It's been a lousy day.

56:59.764 --> 57:01.243
How are you, guys?

57:01.287 --> 57:04.899
We were good until
Queen Buttercup told us

57:04.943 --> 57:07.946
about your play date
with Cluckity Cluck.

57:09.600 --> 57:12.951
-Ooo, what play date?
-We heard.

57:12.994 --> 57:16.302
I bet there's a good reason
it didn't happen, though.

57:16.345 --> 57:19.044
Maybe Cluckity Cluck got sick.

57:19.087 --> 57:20.480
Or slept in.

57:22.177 --> 57:27.618
With the way Reggie the rooster
crows every morning, I doubt it.

57:27.661 --> 57:30.359
He's loud enough
to wake up a stone.

57:30.403 --> 57:33.275
Well, maybe she laid an egg.

57:33.319 --> 57:35.190
Or three.

57:35.234 --> 57:42.154
Or maybe she just forgot
about me. [sighs]

57:42.197 --> 57:47.507
Oh, Bailey,
I'm sure there's a simple
reason Cluckity no-showed.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.204
We're just sure of it.

57:49.248 --> 57:52.991
It doesn't matter. I guess
I'll just get ready for bed.

57:53.034 --> 57:58.866
I'm getting tired anyway
of waiting around
all day for nothing.

57:58.910 --> 58:02.479
Hey, let's give Cluckity
the benefit of the doubt, huh?

58:02.522 --> 58:07.135
Remember that time our foot
got stuck in the ivy branches?

58:07.179 --> 58:11.357
Or the time
she thought she could fly and
got stuck in that big oak tree?

58:11.400 --> 58:13.359
When she was afraid to jump?

58:13.402 --> 58:17.450
Or that time she tripped over
the duck eggs and broke them?

58:17.494 --> 58:21.149
The ducks were so mad, but
then we gave her some bee wax

58:21.193 --> 58:23.543
so she could stick
them back together again.

58:23.587 --> 58:27.765
You, guys, [chuckles] thanks
for trying to cheer me up,

58:27.808 --> 58:31.377
but it's just
disappointing, that's all.

58:31.420 --> 58:35.947
You think you know someone
and then something
like this happens.

58:35.990 --> 58:41.126
I know dogs and chickens
aren't supposed to have
a lot in common anyway,

58:41.169 --> 58:44.782
but Cluckity
has been a good friend.

58:44.825 --> 58:48.916
I guess she just doesn't
feel the same way.

58:48.960 --> 58:52.093
Hey, Bailey, before you
turn in for the night,

58:52.137 --> 58:56.054
what do you say we find Cluckity
and see what's going on?

58:56.097 --> 58:59.710
No, she obviously
doesn't want to see me.

58:59.753 --> 59:04.018
-I'm just a dog after all.
-Oh come on, Bailey.

59:04.062 --> 59:06.978
You're our friend. We love you

59:07.021 --> 59:11.373
and we're sure Cluckity loves
you too just as much as we do.

59:13.854 --> 59:16.770
-I don't know.
-Will you wait up for us?

59:16.814 --> 59:20.774
Maybe we'll discover a reason
that'll make you feel better.

59:20.818 --> 59:25.649
Yeah, we don't want
to see you go to sleep
so bummed out, buddy.

59:25.692 --> 59:29.304
Oh, okay.

59:29.348 --> 59:31.350
Yay!

59:31.393 --> 59:32.830
Yay!

59:32.873 --> 59:35.223
We'll be back soon, Bailey.

59:35.267 --> 59:36.616
Wait up for us.

59:36.660 --> 59:39.663
[music]

59:40.751 --> 59:44.058
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
fly out to see Cluckity Cluck

59:44.102 --> 59:46.887
and ask what happened
to her plans with Bailey.

59:48.149 --> 59:50.630
Sunny, Petal, hey, guys.

59:50.674 --> 59:52.893
It's kind of late in the day
for you to be out, isn't it?

59:52.937 --> 59:55.417
Glad you noticed,
Cluckity Cluck.

59:55.461 --> 59:59.639
-We're here for a friend.
-Oh yeah? Who's your friend?

59:59.683 --> 01:00:04.949
-Bailey the dog.
-Really? I haven't seen him in a
dog's age, we need to catch up.

01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:07.647
Whenever I go up there
we play like crazy.

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:10.650
Funny you mentioned that,
Cluckity, because we heard

01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:13.087
you were supposed
to go out and play today.

01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:17.091
Today? No, we talked
about playing on Thursday.

01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:20.399
Cluck, today is Thursday.

01:00:20.442 --> 01:00:22.923
What? No way?

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:24.838
Time in the coop just flies.

01:00:24.882 --> 01:00:26.318
I missed out on a play date?

01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:29.147
I bet Bailey is so upset.
Is he okay?

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:32.672
Oh I feel terrible.
I promised. What can I do?

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:36.720
How about you come back with us
and apologize to Bailey?

01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:39.026
Okay, that's the least I can do.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:41.115
Alright, let's go.

01:00:42.595 --> 01:00:44.815
[narrator] Sunny and Petal
lead Cluckity Cluck

01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:48.122
to Bailey the dog to make
sure things are set straight

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:49.950
for these two great friends.

01:00:51.038 --> 01:00:53.214
Hi, Bailey, how are you, buddy?

01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:55.390
Hi, Cluckity Cluck.

01:00:56.696 --> 01:00:59.699
I want to apologize for skipping
out on our playdate today,

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:01.614
I forgot what day it was.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.094
Really?

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:06.880
Oh, I was looking forward to it.

01:01:06.924 --> 01:01:10.492
I thought you didn't want
to be my friend anymore.

01:01:10.536 --> 01:01:12.625
What? Bailey, no.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:15.062
I cherish our friendship,
I would never.

01:01:15.106 --> 01:01:18.718
Oh, I mess up everything,
I'm just a dumb chicken.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:23.288
Hey, don't say that,
Cluckity, you're my friend.

01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:27.248
You still want to be my friend
after I left you high and dry?

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:33.254
Sure I do, I'm a dog,
we are loyal to the end.

01:01:33.298 --> 01:01:36.083
Oh, Bailey, I don't deserve you.

01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:39.347
Hey, you want to play tomorrow?

01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:41.306
Wait, that's Friday, right?

01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:42.916
Yep.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.701
Yes, I do.

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:48.748
Well, Petal, it looks like
our work is done here.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.707
It sure does, Sunny.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.013
Come on, it will be dark soon.

01:01:53.057 --> 01:01:56.103
I want to grab
a pollen snack before bed.

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:58.758
[jolly music]

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:03.154
[narrator]
Sunny and Petal returned to the hive to see Queen Buttercup

01:02:03.197 --> 01:02:05.678
and tell her all
about what they've learned

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.681
about keeping promises we make.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.118
Queen Buttercup,
you're still awake.

01:02:11.162 --> 01:02:15.166
I am indeed, Petal.
I wanted to see how
it went for you two out there.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:16.994
Were you able to
find Cluckity Cluck?

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:18.778
We sure were.

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:23.435
-And?
-And it's all fixed, Queen,
no hard feelings.

01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:27.221
-Oh?
-Cluckity forgot
what day it was.

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:29.658
She what?
I swear that chicken

01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:31.922
would forget her own beak
if it wasn't attached.

01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:35.012
[laughter]

01:02:35.055 --> 01:02:37.797
We definitely learned
one thing though,

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:41.322
it's important to keep
the promises we make.

01:02:41.366 --> 01:02:45.196
Yeah, for ourselves,
our friends, and God,

01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:49.722
who keeps track
of everything we do
and every choice we make.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:53.900
That's right, Petal.
The Bible tells us that God
promised the old man Abraham

01:02:53.944 --> 01:02:58.165
more descendants than
there are stars in the sky,
and he kept his promise.

01:02:58.209 --> 01:03:00.341
God leads by example.

01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:03.388
God keeps his promises
and so should we.

01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:04.606
Always.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.173
That's right, Sunny.

01:03:06.217 --> 01:03:09.786
Well, right now,
I plan to keep my promise

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:12.353
to grab a pollen snack
before bed.

01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:14.312
Is that so, young lady?

01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:17.837
[laughter]

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.057
[music]

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.800
[narrator] With souls brimming
with faith and love for God,

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:29.153
little Sunny and Petal set out to spread His word far and wide.

01:03:29.196 --> 01:03:31.677
Praise God, Petal.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.114
Always and forever, Sunny.

01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:36.334
Woohoo!

01:03:36.377 --> 01:03:37.857
Woohoo!

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:41.165
[music]

01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:44.951
What a great day
it's been, Sunny.

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:47.519
And it's only getting started.

01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:49.521
You got that right, Petal

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:53.481
and there's no one I'd
rather spend it with than you.

01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:56.484
Thanks, buddy.

And here is the leader
of the hive, Queen Buttercup.

01:04:07.234 --> 01:04:10.063
Despite Sunny and Petal's
day of adventuring,

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:12.805
she has
a mission waiting for them.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:15.199
Sunny, Petal,
I'm glad you're back.

01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:16.330
We have a dilemma.

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:17.897
What's that?

01:04:17.941 --> 01:04:19.507
Like a rash?

01:04:19.551 --> 01:04:21.640
No, it's not a rash, Sunny.

01:04:21.683 --> 01:04:23.163
A dilemma is
as a situation

01:04:23.207 --> 01:04:25.557
in which a
difficult decision must be made.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.909
Oh no, what's
going on, Queen Buttercup?

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:34.044
Well, Chomps
the mouse has made Felipo
the elephant feel terrible.

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:38.004
I think poor Felipo
could use some friendly
cheer if you two don't mind.

01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:41.529
Oh my, thanks for
thinking of us, Queen.

01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:45.664
Are you kidding?
You two bees are the cheeriest
we have here in the hive.

01:04:45.707 --> 01:04:49.842
You can bring rays of
sunshine to the rainiest day.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.844
We should be magicians.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.846
Magicians for God.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.370
I wonder if that pays well.

01:04:56.414 --> 01:05:00.200
I'm sure it would pay your soul
just fine, Sunny, but right now,

01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:02.681
what we need most
is to cheer Filippo up.

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:04.465
We're on it, Queen.

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:06.380
Yeah, you can count on us.

01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:10.036
Let's go Petal, up, up and away!

[narrator] Sunny and Petal fly
to find their friend Filippo

01:05:25.617 --> 01:05:28.576
and see why
Chomps made him feel bad.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.667
There he is. Hey, big guy,
how's your trunk swinging?

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.408
It's not.

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:35.932
How are you, guys?

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:39.283
Oh, Filippo, what's wrong?

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:43.417
Chomps said something mean to
me, it made me feel pretty bad.

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:45.811
I thought we were friends.

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:48.509
You are friends, Filippo.

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:55.516
Sometimes friends
say things off the cuff
or off the trunk if you will.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.694
Yeah, I bet Chomps
didn't mean it, whatever it was.

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:03.002
I bet he didn't even think
it'd make you feel bad.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:07.267
He said I was a big, dumb,
floppy-eared slowpoke.

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:11.793
Well, That's kind of
hard to misunderstand.

01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:14.492
Yeah, that's a tough one.

01:06:14.535 --> 01:06:16.624
I feel bad just hearing it.

01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:20.237
See? I don't know what
I did to deserve that.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.283
Well, I kind of do.

01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:25.677
What do you mean, Filippo?

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.768
I accidentally
stepped on Chomps tail while
we were walking in the field.

01:06:29.811 --> 01:06:35.339
-Ouch.
-I'm a lot bigger than him,
so it kind of hurt.

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:38.516
But you didn't mean it, Filippo.

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:41.388
-It was an accident.
-Absolutely,

01:06:41.432 --> 01:06:44.739
I'd never hurt a friend
on purpose, much less Chomps.

01:06:44.783 --> 01:06:46.524
We've always gotten along great.

01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:50.789
And that's no small feat
for a mouse and an elephant.

01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:53.313
Chomps does have small "feet",
doesn't he?

01:06:53.357 --> 01:06:56.621
[chuckles] Don't tell him that
though, he's sensitive about it.

01:06:56.664 --> 01:06:58.753
There's no telling
what he'd say back.

01:06:58.797 --> 01:07:02.105
Why don't you go talk
to Chomps, Filippo?

01:07:02.148 --> 01:07:04.020
He can't stay upset forever.

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.109
I bet he comes around.

01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:08.720
Oh, I'm afraid to.

01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:11.592
He didn't want to talk
at all the way he stormed off.

01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:13.768
But it's been a little while.

01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:17.468
I bet Petal's right and he's
calmed down a lot since then.

01:07:18.512 --> 01:07:20.210
Won't you guys go and see him?

01:07:20.253 --> 01:07:22.255
Maybe he'll come around
if you talk to him.

01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:23.430
Let's go.

[narrator] Sunny and Petal
fly to find Chomps,

01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:33.484
who's still sorely from
having his tail stepped on.

01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:37.270
Hi, Chomps, how's it going?

01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:38.967
It's been better.

01:07:39.011 --> 01:07:43.494
That big head, goofball
Filippo squashed my tail.

01:07:43.537 --> 01:07:47.498
Hmm, your tail
looks fine to me, Chomps.

01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:53.417
Yeah?
Try smashing it with an elephant
foot, see how it feels.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.334
Oh, Chomps, I know that
couldn't have felt very good,

01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:59.510
but Filippo didn't mean it.

01:07:59.553 --> 01:08:02.948
Hrr puff... Cheese balls.

01:08:02.991 --> 01:08:07.126
She's right, Chomps and we heard
what you said to Filippo.

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:10.303
It made him feel terrible.

01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:14.438
Good, he should feel terrible
after what he did to me.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.787
But it was an accident.

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:19.225
He still
wants to be your friend.

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:23.707
He should have thought of that
before he squashed my tail.

01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:27.407
Oh boy, Chomps,
is there no way you can

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:30.367
find it in you
to forgive poor Filippo?

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:34.022
No, no, and no!

01:08:34.066 --> 01:08:39.376
Alright, Chomps,
let me tell you a story
that might change your mind.

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:43.684
Once upon a time Peter
came to see Jesus and said,

01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:50.212
"Master, how often am I
to let my brother wrong me
and forgive him?

01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:52.953
Seven times?"
Jesus said to him:

01:08:52.997 --> 01:08:58.264
"I tell you, not 7 times,
but 70 times 7."

01:08:58.308 --> 01:09:03.313
Wait, 70 times 7?

01:09:03.356 --> 01:09:08.970
That's 490 times, ouch.

01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:15.020
You want me to let Filippo
stomp on my tail 490 times?

01:09:15.063 --> 01:09:17.935
No, Chomps, but God does

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:24.029
since forgiveness
of our brothers and sisters
is one of His strong mandates.

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:27.640
And using tongues for good
as opposed to making

01:09:27.685 --> 01:09:30.774
those around us
feel bad is another.

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:36.781
I don't want to go against
God's teachings,

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:40.045
I just want Filippo to
feel bad about what he did.

01:09:40.087 --> 01:09:45.224
But Wanting
to make Filippo feel bad
does go against God, Chomps.

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:47.531
Yeah, it's one thing
to get crabby

01:09:47.573 --> 01:09:50.185
because someone
unintentionally hurt us,

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:53.667
but it's another thing
to attack them because of it.

01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:58.368
Sometimes
our words can hurt much
worse than a foot on a tail.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:01.501
And Filippo's hurting, Chomps.

01:10:01.545 --> 01:10:06.767
He misses
his friend and feels really
bad about what happened today.

01:10:06.811 --> 01:10:09.030
You might think
about forgiving him.

01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:14.645
After all, isn't it
better to have a good friend
who isn't perfect...

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:16.212
None of us are.

01:10:16.255 --> 01:10:18.344
...than a perfect enemy?

01:10:18.388 --> 01:10:25.090
Mmm, oh okay, you're right.

01:10:25.133 --> 01:10:29.964
I don't want to defy God
or lose my friend.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:32.837
Can we go apologize to Filippo?

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.273
Yes!
