[Alba] <i>What do you do when you are going</i>
<i>to lose the thing you love most,</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:19.000
<i>when a piece of your heart</i>
<i>is about to be torn away?</i>

00:19.480 --> 00:20.800
Give me the girl.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.520
No.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.240
Don't make me take her by force, Ángeles.

00:28.720 --> 00:29.960
What are you going to do?

00:31.080 --> 00:33.040
Hit me in public?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.880
I'm her father.
You can't take her without my permission.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.960
See those policemen there?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.360
[Alba] <i>If you're willing</i>
<i>to lose everything,</i>

00:41.440 --> 00:43.560
<i>you don't care how far you might fall.</i>

00:43.640 --> 00:45.920
Please don't take my girl from me.

00:46.520 --> 00:50.080
<i>But if you're not, even the shortest fall</i>
<i>will seem endless.</i>

00:50.160 --> 00:54.640
Please, Mario! She's my daughter.
Please don't take my girl away, Mario!

00:54.720 --> 00:56.120
[Ángeles gasping]

00:57.400 --> 00:59.560
-Do you want me to call them over?
-[Ángeles sighs]

00:59.640 --> 01:01.440
-Mario...
-Well, then.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.400
[Alba] <i>Some people are willing to lose</i>
<i>their freedom for those they love,</i>

01:12.360 --> 01:14.920
<i>even if it means delivering</i>
<i>their souls to the devil.</i>

01:38.920 --> 01:43.640
-Well, it's about time I left.
-Yes, of course.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.520
If you want, I can...
[clears throat] I can go with you.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.040
No, don't worry.
The boardinghouse is nearby.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.320
I'm not worried.
I'd love to accompany you.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.960
It's because of Lola.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.960
She's a nightmare, always checking
when we come in and with whom.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.840
No, it's all right.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.400
Well... [clears throat]

02:07.480 --> 02:10.720
All right... See you tomorrow.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.880
See you tomorrow.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.520
[Alba] <i>There are others, however,</i>

02:17.600 --> 02:20.240
<i>who are not willing</i>
<i>to miss their chance to be happy.</i>

02:34.720 --> 02:37.120
You tart! Where do you think you're going?

02:37.200 --> 02:40.280
[stammering] Marisol, right?
I'm terrible with names.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.680
Don't play innocent with me.
You know who I am!

02:43.760 --> 02:46.400
[grunts] What are you doing here?
The company closed hours ago.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.720
-I was following you.
-Following me? That's interesting.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.840
-Since when, exactly?
-Since the bar.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.200
So don't invent some excuse,
you man-eater.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.040
I'll be very brief.
Pablo's mine, all mine, got it?

02:57.120 --> 02:58.600
I'm not giving him up just like that.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.680
[gasps]

03:02.840 --> 03:06.800
[Alba] <i>The truth is, you never know how</i>
<i>much you love something until you lose it.</i>

03:07.760 --> 03:11.040
<i>It happened to me with Francisco,</i>
<i>with Gimena,</i>

03:11.120 --> 03:13.400
<i>and I didn't want it</i>
<i>to happen to me again.</i>

03:13.480 --> 03:15.600
You know I would leave everything for you?

03:17.560 --> 03:21.320
You don't feel anything for Carlos.
You're saying that to punish me.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.560
Francisco, please.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.240
You're making it up to push me away.
Am I wrong?

03:27.520 --> 03:30.400
[scoffs] You really feel something
for Carlos.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.280
[sighs]

03:33.360 --> 03:35.920
Is it just an infatuation?
Are you in love with him?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Carlos makes me happy.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.600
Do you know how long it's been
since I've felt happy?

03:40.680 --> 03:42.680
Of course I know. Ten years.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.920
Do you know how I felt all those years?

03:48.720 --> 03:51.240
Thinking about you was very, very painful.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.400
Do you know how often you've lied to me
since we've been reunited?

03:55.120 --> 03:56.600
That's the problem, Francisco.

03:57.680 --> 03:58.720
That's the problem.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.680
We're no good for each other.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.760
But we could still get it back,
with no lies, no accusations--

04:04.840 --> 04:06.320
It'd be just the same!

04:08.760 --> 04:09.960
[softly] The same.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.480
Right now, I don't know what I feel...

04:16.880 --> 04:20.160
and Carlos is offering me
the chance to start a new life.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.240
Just like you've had with Elisa.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.320
Carlos.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.160
[Carlos breathing heavily]

04:36.840 --> 04:38.200
[sniffling]

04:43.160 --> 04:44.280
Carlos?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.560
What's wrong?

04:48.680 --> 04:49.720
What happened?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.120
My father is dead.

-We have to talk to her.
-Yes, when she comes back.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.760
-Carlota.
-Please, we have to talk.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.280
My daughter has nothing more
to say to you. Right?

06:52.360 --> 06:54.040
Father, give me two seconds. Please.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.720
[sighs]

06:58.360 --> 07:01.640
-Why did you leave like that?
-Why did you go back to your old life?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.520
It's what's best for all of us.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.320
[Miguel] What are you saying? Why?

07:09.040 --> 07:13.120
[Alba] <i>Sometimes it is worth lying</i>
<i>to avoid losing those you love most.</i>

07:14.440 --> 07:17.480
<i>The only thing that matters</i>
<i>is that they don't find out.</i>

07:17.960 --> 07:21.760
<i>Because if they do,</i>
<i>you will lose them forever...</i>

07:22.640 --> 07:24.080
<i>and you will end up alone.</i>

07:42.280 --> 07:44.000
What are you doing here?

07:44.080 --> 07:45.680
Since you won't come to see me...

07:46.800 --> 07:49.520
My patience is wearing thin, Lidia.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.480
I need more time.
I can't steal from Carlos right now.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.480
-His father just died, for God's sake.
-So what?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.480
What do you mean, "So what?"

08:00.560 --> 08:03.320
Don't tell me you're worried
about breaking his heart,

08:04.040 --> 08:07.960
because more hearts will be broken
if these photos get out.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.840
You're a pig!

08:10.600 --> 08:11.760
Well, well...

08:12.600 --> 08:16.080
The girl pretending to be in love
with Carlos was never really pretending.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.920
Suddenly, the photos of your kiss
with Francisco have twice the power,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.840
twice the importance.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.320
I suppose you know what you're doing,
but I want my money now.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.720
And make it fast, unless you want to lose
both of the men in your life.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.440
[church bell tolling]

09:02.120 --> 09:05.120
We'll follow in two cars.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.720
Carlos, you'll come with me.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.800
-I'm not going.
-What's that?

09:11.720 --> 09:13.960
I'm not going to watch
my father be buried.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.520
Calm down, son. Don't make a scene.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.200
[inhales sharply] I don't care.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.280
Carlos, it's a difficult time
for everyone,

09:22.360 --> 09:28.000
but you're the head of the family now,
and you have to rise to the occasion.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.520
Do it for your father.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.240
[sighs heavily]

09:31.320 --> 09:34.120
We both know that no one expects me
to rise to anything.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.760
Father would have expected even less.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.240
I thought we'd discussed this.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.920
You don't get it, do you?
It's my fault he's dead.

09:48.400 --> 09:53.480
-Don't say that. It wasn't anyone's fault.
-Yes, it was my fault... and yours

09:53.560 --> 09:56.960
for never missing a chance
to tell him his son was a disgrace.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.600
I didn't tell him about the rotary.
He found me in the machine room.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.080
I'd never betray you.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.040
The Francisco I used to know
wouldn't do that.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.000
I don't know what to think
about the one in front of me now.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.120
-Carlos, please--
-Don't touch me.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.800
Carlos. Carlos.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.800
Lidia, I'm sorry, I can't...
I need to be alone.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.280
[Carmen] Let him go. You've done enough.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.600
Carlos needs his family.

10:26.680 --> 10:32.400
Stay out of it
and go back to your place, operator.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.640
-Are you all right, Mother?
-Yes.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.560
[Francisco] Lidia.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.400
Lidia, wait.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.640
Don't hold it against her.
It's a tough time for everyone.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.920
Do you think what that woman says
could affect me?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.080
It's Beltrán, then.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.720
It's Beltrán, it's Carlos,
it's everything.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.120
Stay out of it, please.
Let me take care of it.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.800
It's not just about you.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.920
-You got into this because of me.
-Again, please stay out of it.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.160
I'm not staying out of it.
I'm going to help you.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.920
You don't want Carlos to see those photos?
We'll do it together.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.080
-Why would you do that?
-Because I love you and Carlos.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.600
You're the most important people
in my life.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.000
I don't like seeing you together,
I won't lie...

11:33.920 --> 11:36.040
but it's better
than losing you both forever.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.040
Sir, the cars are ready
to go to the cemetery.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.480
Carlos and I never used to argue,
and it kills me to see him suffer.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.520
-So you and I will confront Beltrán.
-No.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.480
I don't care what you say, Alba.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.840
I'm going to help you.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.200
Barman, another.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.120
You'd better go home.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.080
Hey, you. You're looking for trouble.

12:29.880 --> 12:30.880
Give me another.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.600
What?

12:40.840 --> 12:43.400
-I'm gonna smash your face in.
-You're going to what?

12:44.280 --> 12:45.360
[grunts]

12:54.240 --> 12:55.480
[groaning]

13:21.800 --> 13:23.120
What are you doing here? Get out.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.480
[Carmen] Ubalda.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.720
Ubalda!

13:35.360 --> 13:37.160
Is my son back?

13:38.760 --> 13:42.320
He has no shame, not even
on the day of his father's funeral.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.880
-Elisa.
-I'm worried. He was so upset.

13:45.960 --> 13:49.120
We all are, Mother,
but we didn't desert you

13:49.200 --> 13:51.240
or embarrass the family.

13:52.480 --> 13:56.280
I can't imagine what our friends thought
when he wasn't at the cemetery.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.560
Aren't you worried about what they think?

14:00.640 --> 14:03.680
Of course. But when you're a mother,

14:03.760 --> 14:06.960
you'll understand that your child's pain
matters more than that.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.360
I understand that you're upset.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.360
But it's just a tantrum. That's Carlos.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.640
He loves the attention.

14:15.720 --> 14:20.080
It's a malady that affects
all the members of this family.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.800
That's why my father left Francisco
in charge of the company.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.600
It's time to take the reins
and show what you're capable of.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.560
No one's doing anything here

14:31.640 --> 14:35.840
until the will's been read
and your brother turns up. Understood?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.760
Aren't you going to say anything?

14:52.520 --> 14:54.120
I'm defending
what's in your best interest,

14:54.200 --> 14:56.920
while my brother throws a tantrum,
and you say nothing.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.240
-It's like you agree.
-I do, Elisa.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.800
In this case, I do.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.560
What?

15:12.560 --> 15:16.240
I won't let you fight with your brother.
Not today.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.800
-I lost a mentor, but he lost a father.
-[voice breaking] I lost a father, too.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.000
[crying]

15:24.200 --> 15:27.320
-And I'm your wife.
-I met you thanks to him.

15:28.840 --> 15:34.400
I came to Madrid with nothing...
and your brother gave me a life, a family.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.400
And I could never thank him enough.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.200
All I've done is let him down,
again and again.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.760
He needs me, Elisa.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.440
And if he needs to get away from us
and not go to the funeral,

15:53.520 --> 15:54.800
he has that right.

16:00.640 --> 16:01.640
[crying]

16:02.320 --> 16:04.320
[phone ringing]

16:06.800 --> 16:07.880
[Carmen] Yes?

16:08.640 --> 16:10.720
My son's destroyed what?

16:11.640 --> 16:12.960
In the company?

16:21.680 --> 16:23.000
Damn it!

16:24.680 --> 16:26.440
Did you see where Mr. Cifuentes went?

16:26.520 --> 16:29.040
[worker] No, I just saw him
destroying everything.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.840
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.640
I just wanted to tell you
I was looking for Marisol.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.480
I went to her aunt and uncle's,
which was a bit unpleasant,

16:45.560 --> 16:49.160
and the boardinghouse, too.
All the places I thought she might be.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.320
-And?
-Nothing, no sign of her.

16:53.400 --> 16:57.320
-She must be on her way home.
-Just like that?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.560
After threatening and tormenting me?
I don't think so.

16:59.640 --> 17:04.240
Marga, it's true.
Marisol's got quite a temper.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.200
But, really, she's like...
[mimics explosion]

17:07.280 --> 17:09.400
then she gets over it.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.760
Besides, you don't need to worry.
She can't do anything...

17:14.839 --> 17:19.319
to change the way we feel
about each other.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.880
[both chuckle]

17:22.480 --> 17:24.040
I'm grateful for your visit.

17:24.119 --> 17:28.640
I'm like a mother to María Inmaculada
here in the big city.

17:28.720 --> 17:33.360
Mother of God, how could that girl
have such poor judgment?

17:33.440 --> 17:36.280
Pablo Santos only has a saintly last name.

17:36.360 --> 17:40.320
He's an expert
in deceiving young, innocent girls.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.960
And don't let his sweet face fool you.

17:43.040 --> 17:48.480
He's a demon, a wild man,
only after one thing.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.400
Yes, I know the type. They're the worst.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.120
But rest assured, I'll take care of it.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.400
That's such a relief.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.960
[both giggling]

18:05.040 --> 18:06.400
Ah, by the way,

18:06.480 --> 18:09.040
I know we were going
for a walk this evening,

18:09.120 --> 18:11.200
but I have a slight change of plan.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.520
-Really?
-What do you think?

18:14.480 --> 18:16.760
Tickets to Callao Cinema. It just opened.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.680
They're showing a movie
by some guy named Buster Keaton.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.560
[chuckles] He's a really funny guy,
or so they tell me.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.360
-[stammers] The movies, together?
-Yes.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.880
-Pick you up at nine o'clock?
-At the boardinghouse?

18:28.960 --> 18:32.000
Why don't we meet at the movies?
Oh, never mind.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.000
-[chuckles]
-Why the change?

18:35.920 --> 18:40.080
Since we haven't enjoyed
what the big city has to offer,

18:40.160 --> 18:42.240
I thought we could do it together.

18:43.680 --> 18:47.640
And with what's been happening lately,
with Don Ricardo, the poor man,

18:47.720 --> 18:49.840
and then the Marisol thing...

18:49.920 --> 18:52.280
We need to have
a little joy in our lives, too.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.720
-[chuckles]
-Yes!

18:53.800 --> 18:56.440
And we can celebrate
that we're together at last.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.440
You're right. Nothing can separate us now.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.920
[both chuckle]

19:08.320 --> 19:10.120
[both laugh]

19:10.200 --> 19:12.680
-All right, bye.
-Bye.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.720
-You're not going to the movies?
-Lidia, I'm not ready for the movies yet.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.520
I didn't know
you had to get ready for them.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.400
Am I really the small-town girl here?

19:27.480 --> 19:29.240
Don't you know what couples do
at the movies?

19:29.320 --> 19:31.320
Everything but watch the film.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.680
Pablo and I have had our share of kisses,

19:34.760 --> 19:37.720
and when I'm with him,
I feel warm inside... [chuckles]

19:38.400 --> 19:42.280
It'd be so much easier
if someone gave me some advice...

19:42.360 --> 19:45.200
like if a friend could tell me
about her experiences.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.960
Marga, we're very different.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.360
I don't think my advice
would do you much good.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.600
Carlota always gave me advice
about everything.

19:52.680 --> 19:56.560
-I didn't always listen, but...
-I'm not Carlota.

19:58.560 --> 20:01.360
Right. God, how I miss her!

20:01.440 --> 20:03.040
[doorbell rings]

20:09.680 --> 20:10.920
Hold on.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.160
I told you I never wanted
to see you again.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.840
Oh... yes, you made that clear,
but I'm not here for me.

20:24.920 --> 20:28.000
-[Alba] Is he all right?
-[Victoria] More drunk than battered.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.680
He was lucky.
It could've ended in tragedy.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.920
[sighs] What's he doing here?

20:33.000 --> 20:36.200
One of the girls found him in trouble
and brought him.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.520
He keeps saying your name.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.960
I read the obituary in the paper.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.600
The rich kid is
about to inherit a fortune, right?

20:46.120 --> 20:50.600
In another time, I would've told you
to take advantage of the situation.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.040
With a ring on your finger,
you won't need to steal anything.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.920
Not everyone does things
out of self-interest.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.760
I was only thinking
of what's best for you.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.040
My mistake was thinking
I didn't deserve a better life than this.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.960
But now I have friends
and people who love me.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.040
-Who knows? Maybe this is a second chance.
-Mm.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.080
You're walking on a spiderweb, princess.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.320
Be careful you don't get caught in it.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.480
This man loves Lidia Aguilar.

21:24.560 --> 21:28.080
Believe me, you can't keep a lie like that
going your whole life.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.320
Christ, Sofía,
are you going to sleep or not?

21:36.400 --> 21:39.200
Mother, do something with her.
I can't take it anymore!

21:39.280 --> 21:42.520
-Give her to me.
-Now she's crying!

21:42.600 --> 21:44.880
-You're not very good at this.
-Jesus Christ!

21:44.960 --> 21:46.680
[Asunción] There, there, honey.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.720
A girl needs a mother.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.160
A proper mother, not one like hers!

21:51.640 --> 21:54.080
She seemed so nice. It's all right, honey.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.600
It's those suffragettes.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.160
Her friends put absurd ideas in her head.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.280
-I'm going to the bar.
-Don't be long.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.480
[Ángeles gasps]

22:25.560 --> 22:28.360
Where are you going? Where?

22:28.440 --> 22:31.240
Do you think I'm an idiot? Come on.

22:31.320 --> 22:35.400
-Don't put your hand on me again.
-Go.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.600
-I want to see my daughter.
-Go.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.160
-You want to see her?
-Yes.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.840
You should've thought of that
before you tried to take her away.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.200
I'm her father.
The law's on my side, and you know it.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.280
Do you think I'm the bad guy here?

22:46.360 --> 22:49.000
-Shall I remind you how this started?
-I apologized.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.280
Maybe I should remind you
what you did to me.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.000
I apologized.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.600
I did all I could to fix things,
and you didn't give me a chance.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.480
I'm not giving you a chance now
to take her away.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.800
Don't make me call the police.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.600
-Please, Mario.
-Go.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.200
Go.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.720
[Carmen] Indalecio, I'm so grateful
you decided to disregard

23:22.800 --> 23:27.520
my husband's irrational whim
and leave the will as it was.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.440
[Indalecio] With all due respect, Carmen,
Ricardo signed his last wishes,

23:32.520 --> 23:36.360
specifying that Francisco
would take charge of the company,

23:36.440 --> 23:40.480
Elisa would be the main shareholder,
and Carlos would have an income

23:40.560 --> 23:43.880
as long as he gave up
any claim to the company.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.200
But you decided not
to give it to the notary.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.680
Otherwise, we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.840
Although it's not a will, per se...

23:55.600 --> 23:59.160
it expresses
what the deceased intended, and so--

23:59.240 --> 24:01.400
As you said, it's just an intention,

24:01.480 --> 24:05.040
and cemeteries are
full of good intentions.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.320
It's the living who have to keep going.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.600
How long have you been
this family's lawyer?

24:13.520 --> 24:16.080
-Twenty-three years.
-Twenty-three years.

24:16.160 --> 24:20.080
I'd like you to carry on
for another 23 years.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.000
-Careful.
-[Carmen] What is your price?

24:23.120 --> 24:25.920
-Let's go to bed. Come on.
-[groans softly]

24:26.960 --> 24:29.480
Let's go. Carlos, not now.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.720
Let's get to bed.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.880
Lidia, is that you?

24:38.960 --> 24:40.320
[chuckles]

24:40.400 --> 24:42.200
[whispers] I'm your guardian angel.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.920
All right...

24:56.600 --> 24:59.280
Do you know how many times
I've imagined you in my bed?

25:05.440 --> 25:06.680
I love you.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.280
When you meet the real Lidia,
will you love me the same?

25:21.720 --> 25:24.120
You'll get over it tomorrow,
after you sleep it off.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.080
[Carmen] Thank you, Indalecio. Lidia!

26:01.320 --> 26:03.720
It's a good thing that my son's home now.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.640
I was just saying to Indalecio
that if he didn't turn up tonight,

26:07.720 --> 26:11.160
we'd have to put it in the hands
of the authorities.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.000
But fortunately, there was no need.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.520
So, thank you. You can go.

26:19.320 --> 26:20.600
Good day.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.600
-He turned up?
-[Carmen] Yes.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.720
Where was he?

26:25.400 --> 26:29.480
Getting drunk in a bar...
that we went to a few days ago.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.600
You've gotten to know my son very well
in such a short time.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.640
Someone might think that annoys you.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.960
My dear, there were others before you.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.880
[chuckles] Yes.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.240
Many others.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.440
But a woman like me? I doubt it.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.120
[chuckles]

26:48.200 --> 26:51.000
I don't want to be rude
or to make an enemy of you,

26:51.080 --> 26:53.840
but don't compete with me
for Carlos' favor.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.680
You have a good chance of losing.

26:58.720 --> 27:02.480
Francisco, accompany this young lady
back to wherever she lives.

27:02.560 --> 27:08.080
It's not good for a decent girl like her
to be walking the streets alone at night.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.800
Carlos destroyed the prototype.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.680
What? The rotary?

27:20.760 --> 27:22.880
An employee called a couple of hours ago.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.240
Carlos was drunk and trashed everything.

27:25.320 --> 27:28.960
Beltrán's going to publish the photos.
It'll be a scandal.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.200
I can get more money.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.240
You don't have the amount of money
this man is demanding.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.160
Then it's over?

27:44.400 --> 27:46.440
My life, your life, my marriage,
your relationship with Carlos?

27:46.520 --> 27:48.800
As long as he has the photos,
yes, I'm afraid so.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.960
Where are you going at this hour?

28:22.800 --> 28:25.760
[stammering] Doña Lola!
I was going out for a walk.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.160
There's still some time
before the doors are locked. Bye.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.040
Hold it right there!

28:32.120 --> 28:34.160
You're going out
with your shoes in your hand?

28:34.240 --> 28:37.080
What's next, your handbag on your feet?

28:37.160 --> 28:38.800
I did it so I wouldn't bother you.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.520
When you say the rosary,
you get distracted so easily.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.280
-With whom are you going on a walk?
-What?

28:44.360 --> 28:46.680
Who are you walking with?

28:46.760 --> 28:49.880
[stammering] Oh, er...
I'm going... with Lidia.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.120
Off to the movies after all?

28:55.200 --> 28:58.240
[gasps] You're going to the movies?
Have you no shame?

28:58.320 --> 29:01.440
It's just a movie!
It's short and very funny.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.240
She's going to the movies, not a brothel.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.880
There's not much of a difference.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.760
Only wasters and tarts go there
to feel each other up.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.120
You're going with that Pablo Santos,
aren't you?

29:13.800 --> 29:17.120
-[stammering] How do you know about Pablo?
-Marisol told me.

29:18.320 --> 29:19.920
[stammers] Marisol?

29:20.000 --> 29:23.120
-How do you know Marisol?
-That's none of your business.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.880
But you're not leaving
until you bring me this Pablo

29:25.960 --> 29:29.120
so I can talk to him.
Otherwise, I'm calling your grandmother!

29:29.200 --> 29:30.200
No.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.000
[breathing heavily]

29:41.400 --> 29:42.400
[clears throat]

29:42.480 --> 29:46.880
Uh, Doña Lola, I'd like to ask you,
if you don't mind...

29:46.960 --> 29:49.680
Tell me how I can help you...

29:49.760 --> 29:52.600
instead of just staring at me
like a barn owl.

29:53.160 --> 29:58.000
-What are your intentions with Marga?
-Me? To take her to the movies.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.960
Hmm. I suppose you take them all there

30:01.040 --> 30:04.120
and then pounce on them
like a fox in a henhouse.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.680
[chuckles nervously] All of them?
All of who?

30:08.760 --> 30:13.880
No, I don't know what Marisol told you,
but never mind. It's a lie.

30:13.960 --> 30:18.040
-So she's not your girlfriend.
-Yes. No, yes, not anymore.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.200
She was.

30:20.280 --> 30:23.840
I suppose it's also not true
that you asked her to marry you.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.000
-Pablo?
-Hmm?

30:26.080 --> 30:30.360
Yes, yes, but to be completely honest,
I was drunk at the time.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.080
It was the village festival,
and I'd had a few...

30:33.160 --> 30:35.080
I haven't drank since then.
I don't like it.

30:35.160 --> 30:36.720
Sometimes Mario insists, but I try to...

30:36.800 --> 30:39.640
So then there's no reason
to doubt that it's true.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.280
You knocked up the poor girl.

30:41.360 --> 30:44.960
-Pablo! What is she saying?
-No, Marga! It's a lie!

30:45.040 --> 30:46.920
Get out of this house at once,

30:47.000 --> 30:51.480
and don't go near Marga again
or I'll report you for bigamy!

30:51.560 --> 30:54.560
-[Marga] Lola, please, this is--
-It's a lie because I'm a virgin!

30:58.960 --> 31:00.280
[chuckles]

31:02.240 --> 31:07.320
Doña Lola, I didn't knock up Marisol
or any other girl...

31:08.800 --> 31:11.600
because I haven't slept with any women.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.960
Not even paying for it?

31:19.240 --> 31:20.840
[Flora] Sir. Sir!

31:20.920 --> 31:22.440
[Miguel] I'll be quick.
I want to speak to Carlota.

31:22.520 --> 31:25.000
-I told him not to come in.
-I'll handle this, Flora.

31:25.080 --> 31:28.760
-My daughter's not taking visitors.
-I'll only be a moment.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.480
-Get out.
-Carlota!

31:30.560 --> 31:32.360
-Miguel?
-[Emilio] Take her away.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.640
-Wait, don't go!
-Carlota, we had a deal!

31:34.720 --> 31:37.080
-Let's go. It's best for everyone.
-[Miguel] What deal?

31:37.160 --> 31:39.240
Come back. You can't leave us!

31:39.880 --> 31:41.360
Get out of my house.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.800
You did the right thing, darling.
You know your father. Don't defy him.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.480
-You don't know what he could do.
-Miguel just wanted to see me.

31:55.560 --> 31:58.280
I know. If it were up to me,
there'd be no problem.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.200
Relax. I'll tell you
when things settle down, hmm?

32:05.840 --> 32:07.200
[door closes]

32:07.280 --> 32:08.560
[door locks]

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Carlota, don't worry.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.800
We knew this could happen.

32:13.880 --> 32:16.920
Why are you here?
I told you to respect my decision.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.840
What deal was your father talking about?

32:33.720 --> 32:36.400
He got me out of jail in exchange
for you coming home, right?

32:38.240 --> 32:41.040
-You didn't have to do that.
-I couldn't let you stay locked up.

32:41.120 --> 32:44.360
Don't you understand?
You sacrificed yourself for nothing.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.760
-I could've done it alone.
-What?

32:47.840 --> 32:51.600
The phone tapping.
I've got some very important information.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.520
They're planning a coup.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.000
-Two attempts have already failed.
-This is different.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.120
The army's getting organized,
and they have political support.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.120
Someone called the Falcon
is organizing it.

33:04.280 --> 33:07.000
With this, we can negotiate
your return to the company.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.920
Come on, Miguel's waiting.
Come back to us.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.480
I can't. I can't go back.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.400
My father will stop at nothing. I'm sorry.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.800
I just wanted a better life for Sofía.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.080
This happens every day.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.880
In this country,
a horse is worth more than a woman

33:50.960 --> 33:53.200
-because they work and don't complain.
-[sighs]

33:54.760 --> 33:58.480
I haven't lost a daughter like you did.
I can't imagine what it's like...

34:00.320 --> 34:03.480
being on a dead-end street
of lies and deception.

34:03.560 --> 34:05.200
[Marga] Lying is never good.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.360
Look what my Pablo had to admit
so we wouldn't split up.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.159
I was about to lose him
because of all that lying.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.000
Come on, it's late.

34:17.080 --> 34:21.639
Yes, I'm going to bed,
or I'll never get up tomorrow.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.520
-Good night, girls.
-Good night.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.719
[Ángeles] Who are you sending that to?

34:53.880 --> 34:55.000
To Carlos.

34:56.159 --> 34:59.360
I'm going to tell him the whole truth.
I can't keep lying to him.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.680
Do you care about him?

35:05.720 --> 35:09.760
Then don't do it like that, Lidia.
Be honest.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.800
You know that honesty is not my forte.

35:16.920 --> 35:20.880
But when you have been honest,
things have gone well for you.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.400
I forgave you
when you were honest with me.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.120
Say it to his face. Be brave.

35:32.200 --> 35:35.600
[scoffs] Look at me.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.760
I wanted to do everything
behind Mario's back, and...

35:38.840 --> 35:40.920
[sighs] what was the result?

35:41.960 --> 35:43.160
[sighs]

35:43.240 --> 35:44.680
Tell him everything, Lidia.

35:44.760 --> 35:50.560
It will make the photos meaningless
and save your relationship with Carlos.

35:59.320 --> 36:00.800
What are you going to do?

36:06.960 --> 36:08.160
[sighs]

36:08.240 --> 36:09.640
[door opens]

36:10.320 --> 36:12.040
[Asunción] What did you forget, son?

36:14.480 --> 36:17.240
Asunción, please let me see my daughter.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.920
You should've thought of that
before you deserted her.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.320
I'll be right there, honey.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.000
Be grateful I won't tell my son,
because if he found out--

36:26.080 --> 36:30.160
I see your son didn't tell you.
I left home because of him.

36:31.160 --> 36:33.240
-Liar.
-Liar?

36:36.920 --> 36:39.400
Do you think I'm making this up?

36:44.160 --> 36:48.000
-My son couldn't do something like that.
-Your son beat me.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.280
He beat me,
and I lost the child I was carrying.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
That's what your son did.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.160
That's why I left. So, please, Asunción...

36:56.240 --> 36:59.000
Please let me see my daughter.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.080
-Sofía!
-Mama!

37:10.160 --> 37:11.480
[chuckles]

37:11.560 --> 37:15.560
My girl! Let me see you.
You look so pretty!

37:23.960 --> 37:25.160
What are you doing here?

37:26.680 --> 37:29.160
Your mother's putting away
your father's things.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.840
-She says it hurts to see them.
-[smacks lips]

37:32.760 --> 37:35.760
-You want a souvenir of your master?
-I don't want to fight.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.600
Are you sure?

37:38.760 --> 37:39.960
You'd definitely win.

37:42.040 --> 37:45.360
With my aching body and hangover,
a fly could beat me.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.080
I know what you think of me,
but I didn't do it.

37:50.840 --> 37:51.920
I am who I am thanks to you.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.880
Who you are... What about who you were?

37:54.960 --> 37:58.160
What's left of that Francisco?
You're not the man I knew.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.680
If it's about the rotary,
I did not betray you.

38:00.760 --> 38:04.240
It's everything. The rotary, the spying...

38:05.320 --> 38:06.320
and Lidia.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.840
Would it do any good
if I said I was wrong about her?

38:11.480 --> 38:13.080
You have my blessing.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.200
You really don't care
that Lidia and I are together?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.040
No.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.320
You've always been a bad liar,

38:20.400 --> 38:22.960
except for when you lied for my father.
Then you nailed it.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.760
Who cares what I think of you two?

38:24.840 --> 38:26.560
I want to fix things.
What do I have to do?

38:27.920 --> 38:29.080
Maybe you can't.

38:30.480 --> 38:34.600
That's it? This is the end?
Our friendship is over because of a woman?

38:35.160 --> 38:36.480
That's not what I want...

38:38.800 --> 38:40.160
but it's not up to me.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.680
Son, we're going to be late.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.400
-Why don't we go ahead?
-Elisa...

38:56.480 --> 38:58.000
I'll catch up, Mother.

39:04.880 --> 39:08.320
I was sure I dreamed
you brought me home after a fight.

39:08.400 --> 39:11.080
I don't know why
I suddenly have the feeling it was real.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.240
That depends. Do you dream of me often?

39:15.600 --> 39:16.760
Every night.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.240
Then it must have been another dream.
[chuckles]

39:21.320 --> 39:24.520
If it weren't for the bruises
all over my body, I'd believe that.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.400
Those eyes...

39:30.120 --> 39:31.840
Are you worried about something?

39:35.200 --> 39:39.640
No, I'd just like to talk to you.
I need to tell you something.

39:39.720 --> 39:42.360
I have the reading of the will now.
Can it be later?

39:42.440 --> 39:44.440
Yes. [chuckles]

39:44.520 --> 39:47.840
Nine o'clock tonight,
at the train station?

39:47.920 --> 39:50.280
The train station? Why there?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.000
You'll see.

40:05.800 --> 40:09.600
-[Beltrán] <i>Inspector Beltrán speaking.</i>
-Francisco Gómez, the Telephone Company.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.600
<i>Mr. Gómez, what a surprise.</i>
<i>How can I help you?</i>

40:12.680 --> 40:16.560
Let's not beat around the bush.
Alba told me about the photos.

40:16.640 --> 40:19.400
I want to sort it out
as quickly and discreetly as possible.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.800
That's easy. Have you got the money?

40:24.280 --> 40:26.720
<i>I do. Where can we meet?</i>

40:28.080 --> 40:31.120
Come to my house tonight at 9:00.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.600
<i>Valverde 31, 3A. I'll be waiting for you.</i>

40:34.680 --> 40:35.760
[line disconnects]

40:35.840 --> 40:38.040
[Carmen] Thank you for your punctuality,
Indalecio,

40:38.120 --> 40:42.920
and for seeing the notary into the office.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
-[Indalecio] It's easy to get lost here.
-[Elisa] I'll tell my husband.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.000
-Honey.
-Yes?

40:48.080 --> 40:49.880
The notary and Indalecio are here.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.280
Let's go.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.040
Forgive the delay.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.200
[exhales heavily]

41:07.280 --> 41:10.520
[notary] Sit down, please.
We're starting straightaway.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.680
You're very nervous.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.680
Do you think our father
left you with nothing?

41:18.760 --> 41:20.080
I only hope he took into account

41:20.160 --> 41:23.080
the efforts Francisco has made
for the company and this family.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.480
I think he took that into account
when he made him director, didn't he?

41:27.480 --> 41:30.400
I bet he hasn't left me a generous income.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.480
-He was afraid I'd squander it.
-The things you say!

41:35.080 --> 41:38.120
All right. Now that we're all here,

41:38.200 --> 41:41.440
we'll proceed to the opening
and subsequent reading

41:41.520 --> 41:44.320
of the will
of Don Ricardo Cifuentes y Navarro,

41:44.400 --> 41:46.520
the last version I have in my power,

41:46.600 --> 41:51.480
unless the deceased expressed
any last wishes to modify said document.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.760
He did not.

41:53.600 --> 41:56.840
Then I shall proceed.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.640
"To my beloved wife,
I leave the family home

42:04.720 --> 42:09.560
and 30,000 pesetas annual income,
to be paid until the day of her death.

42:10.320 --> 42:15.280
To my daughter Elisa,
I leave the summer house in San Sebastián

42:15.360 --> 42:17.480
so she may enjoy the sea air

42:17.560 --> 42:21.440
and cure her nervous ailment,
plus an income of 15,000 pesetas.

42:23.760 --> 42:28.840
Ownership of the Telephone Company
and the rest of my fortune,

42:28.920 --> 42:33.400
except those amounts mentioned previously,
I leave to...

42:35.120 --> 42:38.560
my only son, Carlos,

42:38.640 --> 42:41.320
who I hope will be my worthy successor,

42:41.400 --> 42:45.480
and who will run the company with acumen
and honor his family name."

42:45.560 --> 42:49.800
He left everything... to you?

42:53.440 --> 42:56.480
I don't understand! I don't...
It makes no sense!

42:56.560 --> 42:59.400
It's what your father wanted, Elisa.
He had his reasons.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.560
-If it's any consolation, I had no idea.
-Oh, poor Carlos!

43:02.640 --> 43:06.360
What a terrible burden,
inheriting the entire family fortune!

43:06.440 --> 43:07.840
-Elisa...
-What?

43:07.920 --> 43:09.160
Elisa, my girl!

43:10.080 --> 43:11.400
[Francisco sighs]

43:11.480 --> 43:13.880
Let her blow off some steam.
She has good reason.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.840
See how your father trusted you?

43:16.440 --> 43:19.160
He knew you were brilliant,
and this is proof of it.

43:20.560 --> 43:23.880
Carlos, believe it or not,
I'm happy for you.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.320
I just want us to sort out
our differences.

43:27.400 --> 43:30.440
It's not good to be fighting
with everything that's going on.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.800
[Carlos sighs]

43:32.880 --> 43:34.800
Why don't we meet up tonight and talk?

43:35.720 --> 43:39.120
We'll drink as much as we need
to sort this out. Hmm?

43:39.200 --> 43:43.200
[chuckles] I can't tonight.
I'm meeting Lidia at the train station.

43:43.280 --> 43:47.280
She wants to tell me all about herself,
but we do need those drinks.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.840
Another time, all right?

43:49.960 --> 43:51.360
Sure, whenever you like.

43:59.680 --> 44:03.440
Don't worry about what your sister says.
You know what she's like.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.760
The company is yours now,
just like it was your father's before you.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.360
Honestly, I don't get it either.

44:12.440 --> 44:16.440
Your time has come,
and you have to tread carefully,

44:16.520 --> 44:19.360
in both your professional
and personal life.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.680
You can relax about the latter.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.760
In Lidia,
I've found what I've been looking for.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.120
[Carmen] That operator
seems like a good girl,

44:28.200 --> 44:31.520
but being the companion
of Carlos Cifuentes isn't the same

44:31.600 --> 44:35.000
as being the fiancée of the owner
of the Telephone Company.

44:41.960 --> 44:45.000
I've been thinking about that project
you wanted to do.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.000
What was your plan?

44:48.120 --> 44:49.120
My plan?

44:50.320 --> 44:52.360
I was thinking of installing the rotary

44:52.440 --> 44:54.280
in a small station like Santander.

44:54.360 --> 44:55.640
Why not in Madrid?

44:58.320 --> 45:00.320
Since when are you interested
in the business?

45:00.400 --> 45:05.800
Son, there's something you should know.
A woman may be silent, but she's not deaf.

45:05.880 --> 45:08.680
I know more about this business
than any of you.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.200
Why not set it up in Madrid?

45:12.720 --> 45:15.240
Because I'm not sure
if I want to move forward with it.

45:15.320 --> 45:18.160
It would take a huge investment
and we'd lay off a lot of staff,

45:18.240 --> 45:19.840
putting many operators out of work.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.840
There are always connections...

45:22.640 --> 45:25.200
Didn't you hear me?
I'm not sure if I want to do it.

45:25.280 --> 45:28.560
You have to do it. Your time has come.

45:28.640 --> 45:31.920
All the quarrels and fights
you had with your father

45:32.000 --> 45:35.720
were to light a fire under you,
to prepare you for this.

45:35.800 --> 45:38.240
Enough excuses and whining.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.680
You have to do it...

45:40.880 --> 45:42.520
and I'm going to help you.

45:45.400 --> 45:50.040
I've always had faith in you,
and you know it.

45:51.360 --> 45:54.080
I know, Mother. I know.

45:54.160 --> 46:00.120
You look after the profits.
I'll bring you investors.

46:08.960 --> 46:09.960
[man] Pablo Santos?

46:10.760 --> 46:14.720
From Don Carlos.
You're to call to acknowledge receipt.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.360
[phone ringing]

46:25.240 --> 46:27.800
-Hello.
<i>-Yes, this is Pablo Santos--</i>

46:27.880 --> 46:30.960
Great. Look, I need you
to do a cost-profit analysis

46:31.040 --> 46:33.480
for the installation
of the Rotary 7 in Madrid.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.440
All the information is in the folder.

46:35.520 --> 46:39.320
<i>And I don't need to tell you</i>
<i>that this is strictly confidential.</i>

46:39.400 --> 46:41.200
Yes, don't worry.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.520
Get the engineers in section five
to stop what they're doing

46:46.600 --> 46:49.360
and help Miguel Pascual
with the project he was on.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.200
It's been destroyed,
but I want it restored at once.

46:52.280 --> 46:53.280
Thanks.

47:16.920 --> 47:18.720
Pablo, what are you doing?

47:18.800 --> 47:20.280
Pablo! They'll hear us.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.320
-Last time--
-Shh! It's not what you think, Marga.

47:24.400 --> 47:27.800
-I don't want them to hear us.
-What's going on?

47:27.880 --> 47:30.520
Marga, what I...

47:30.600 --> 47:34.120
[coughs] What I have to tell you
is highly confidential.

47:35.200 --> 47:37.560
Look... Okay.

47:37.640 --> 47:41.280
I've discovered
that they're developing a machine

47:41.360 --> 47:45.400
that could increase
the company's profits exponentially.

47:46.400 --> 47:50.240
-But that's great.
-No, no, it's terrifying, Marga,

47:50.320 --> 47:52.680
because if this thing goes ahead...

47:54.520 --> 47:56.680
all the operators will be fired.

47:58.880 --> 48:02.840
What?
God, I'll have to go back to my hometown!

48:03.280 --> 48:04.840
-Oh, God.
-And there's something else.

48:04.920 --> 48:06.400
[clears throat]

48:06.480 --> 48:07.960
There's something else.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.000
-You have to come.
-[Carlota] <i>Marga, I can't.</i>

48:12.080 --> 48:16.360
Carlota, this is serious. Really serious.
They're going to fire all of us.

48:16.440 --> 48:20.120
-What? What are you talking about?
<i>-Pablo told me, and he doesn't lie.</i>

48:20.200 --> 48:21.880
At least not about this.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.680
And another thing...

48:25.880 --> 48:27.560
I don't know if I should tell you...

48:27.640 --> 48:30.680
-Marga!
<i>-It's Miguel's fault.</i>

48:32.080 --> 48:35.080
<i>He invented a machine that's going to put</i>
<i>all the operators out of work.</i>

48:35.160 --> 48:36.160
What?

48:36.680 --> 48:39.600
<i>Fine, I'll see you after work</i>
<i>outside the bar across the street.</i>

48:41.360 --> 48:42.800
[Emilio] You're not going anywhere.

48:44.040 --> 48:47.400
Father, I am back for good,
but I can't stay locked up all day.

48:47.480 --> 48:49.280
I will not tolerate that tone.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.320
What tone? I left the company.
I came home. I kept my word.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.120
-Word? You don't keep your word.
-And you'll never have my respect!

48:58.880 --> 49:01.480
Don Emilio, The Falcon

49:06.520 --> 49:07.600
The Falcon?

49:09.520 --> 49:11.080
You're the Falcon?

49:11.160 --> 49:14.720
