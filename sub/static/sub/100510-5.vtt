Bring Huey home.

02:40.870 --> 02:43.789
- Daddy!
- Hey, mama. What's up? Hmm?

02:43.831 --> 02:46.458
I like your tiny Huey banner.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.460
He's coming home soon, you know?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.421
My daddy changes the world.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.773
And you're gonna, too,
little lady.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.757
Huh?

02:53.799 --> 02:55.718
How you been, Rox?

02:55.759 --> 02:58.012
- Fine.
- Hmm.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.430
I mean, you don't look fine.

02:59.471 --> 03:03.100
Work's just been intense.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.727
So I see.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.937
I just hope you're bleeding
for a worthy cause, Rox.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.206
Because with Buchanan
and Buckley

03:08.230 --> 03:09.607
breathing down our necks,

03:09.648 --> 03:10.876
I don't think you should
be giving your blood

03:10.900 --> 03:12.860
to anybody but your own.

03:12.902 --> 03:15.195
We need the money, Darnell.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.739
I'm working this job

03:16.780 --> 03:18.741
so you can keep doing
what you're doing here.

03:20.159 --> 03:21.869
And I'm bleeding
for the worthiest cause

03:21.911 --> 03:23.120
in the whole fu...

03:24.663 --> 03:27.708
F-U-C-K-I-N-G world.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.728
- Look, I didn't mean
any disre...
- Mama's got to go.

03:29.752 --> 03:33.130
I love you, little chicken.

03:33.172 --> 03:36.550
I'm gonna hug you so tight,
I'm gonna make you poop.

03:39.011 --> 03:42.222
You be good for Daddy now. Okay?

03:42.264 --> 03:44.975
Power to the people, Mommy.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.856
Now, what do you...?

03:52.191 --> 03:53.734
Come on, mama.

03:53.776 --> 03:59.365
Brains are of little help
when brawn is needed.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.825
Joe will train you.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.827
He will exhaust you.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.246
Let your anger feed you.

04:06.288 --> 04:11.543
The war we are in,
you'll need stamina.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.671
Believe me, I should know.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.845
The Wolf tested
my stamina every day.

04:21.887 --> 04:27.768
Of all the prisoners in his pen,
he had it out for me.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.562
It's because of my safta?

05:04.555 --> 05:07.516
Jesus fucking Christ.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.935
How many people have you killed?

05:09.977 --> 05:12.021
Small indignities

05:12.062 --> 05:15.899
grew to outright assaults.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.901
Until one night,

05:17.943 --> 05:22.656
I was dragged from my sleep
to the doctor's chambers.

05:22.698 --> 05:26.910
And there reigned The Wolf.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.881
He made sure I couldn't run.

05:40.466 --> 05:44.595
I screamed just once.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.474
That was it.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.476
Never again would I scream.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.519
I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.237
He tortured me

06:02.279 --> 06:04.239
for nine hours.

06:04.281 --> 06:07.493
I know because I counted
in my head.

06:07.534 --> 06:12.331
One minute, two minutes.

06:16.168 --> 06:17.836
An hour.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.964
Two hours. Five hours.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.217
Six.

06:26.845 --> 06:31.725
The tools this surgeon
had used to mend soldiers

06:31.767 --> 06:35.813
he now used to tear me apart.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.167
But I had the stamina.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.503
I wore him out.

07:09.763 --> 07:13.517
And then, suddenly,
I had the chance.

07:13.559 --> 07:19.273
There was a hammer
so close to me,

07:19.314 --> 07:21.316
I could touch it.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.860
So close.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.903
I could have grabbed it.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.907
I could have killed him
in that very moment.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.702
But I didn't do anything.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.121
Why?

07:34.163 --> 07:36.748
Was it weakness?

07:36.790 --> 07:41.753
Was it that true evil kills you
from the inside out,

07:41.795 --> 07:44.756
rendering you inert?

07:46.425 --> 07:52.014
Or was it a light from within,
talking to me,

07:52.055 --> 07:57.436
telling me that even killing
this man was wrong?

07:57.477 --> 08:00.355
Whatever it was,

08:00.397 --> 08:03.775
it stopped me
from doing something horrible

08:03.817 --> 08:07.613
when something horrible
needed to be done.

08:12.201 --> 08:15.871
Because I didn't act,

08:15.913 --> 08:21.376
what I thought was the end
was only the start.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.379
Jesus Christ.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.799
It's like you were
clawed by a...

08:27.841 --> 08:29.801
A wolf?

08:29.843 --> 08:35.390
And yet...
it wasn't just this scar

08:35.432 --> 08:40.854
that earned him
that moniker, The Wolf.

08:40.896 --> 08:42.856
I hesitated once,

08:42.898 --> 08:47.319
and it was the greatest mistake
I ever made.

08:47.361 --> 08:52.950
Jonah, when your time comes,
swear to me

08:52.991 --> 08:56.411
you will not let
what's inside you stop you

08:56.453 --> 08:59.498
from doing what is difficult.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.168
- Jonah, swear to me.
- I swear.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.297
I will hold you to that.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.971
Ha. Yeah, who's the slow one
now, bitch?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.222
Come on.

09:20.978 --> 09:24.064
Seriously, how many people
have you killed?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.447
'Cause it's got something
to do with the timing.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.991
I know.

09:34.032 --> 09:38.036
Oh, Jesus. You smell like
what slides out of a cow

09:38.078 --> 09:40.789
- after a calf is born.
- All right.

09:40.831 --> 09:46.169
It's time to hunt The Ghost,
owner of box 630.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.880
Let's find
that nine-fingered fucker.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.507
Wh-What happened to the tenth?

09:50.549 --> 09:53.510
Oh, the tenth finger
is in the belly

09:53.552 --> 09:55.512
of a Romani girl.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.515
Bit it off while he was
experimenting on her.

09:58.557 --> 10:01.768
Ruth long ago ID'd
two of the men in this photo.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.979
The first one you'll recognize:
The Wolf,

10:04.021 --> 10:06.940
whereabouts obviously unknown.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.443
But the guy on the end?

10:09.484 --> 10:12.029
That's Dieter Zweigelt,
top lieutenant of The Ghost.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.282
Records say he ran a lab
for The Ghost at Auschwitz.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.908
Yes, and that little piggy

10:16.950 --> 10:18.368
is here.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.496
I found him in the visa
applications for 1945.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.749
After Auschwitz fell,
Zweigelt changed his name

10:23.790 --> 10:26.126
to, uh, Victor Dillman.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.962
So I searched for
and found a Victor Dillman.

10:29.004 --> 10:32.883
Same age, a doctor
in Huntsville, Alabama.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.301
Well,

10:34.343 --> 10:37.512
Joe, Jonah,

10:37.554 --> 10:40.515
and Harriet
will pay him a visit.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.811
Wait'll those rednecks get
a gander at you, Shlomo.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.855
Yeah, I d... I don't
look that Jewish.

10:46.897 --> 10:50.484
You? Jew.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.943
- We found something else.
- Yeah.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.113
We found a lead
on someone who knew The Ghost.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.115
Yeah, biblically.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.994
Wait. All right.

11:01.036 --> 11:04.831
Okay, Tilda Sauer, propagandist.

11:04.873 --> 11:08.335
Uh, Goebbels'
favorite filmmaker.

11:08.377 --> 11:09.795
She was also schtupping
The Ghost.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.631
All right, uh, Murray,
you made that clear.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.843
She lured people to worship
a genocidal madman.

11:16.885 --> 11:21.848
She spun his murders
of our people as heroic deeds.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.534
Now, Ruth couldn't verify it,
but she believed

11:23.558 --> 11:25.644
that Tilda might now
be in the States,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.313
living as Karen Ballinger...
Would you believe it...

11:28.355 --> 11:30.023
A political consultant,
a spin doctor

11:30.065 --> 11:31.608
in Westchester.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.194
Roxy, Lonny, and I will pay

11:34.236 --> 11:35.987
- this snake a call.
- With any luck,

11:36.029 --> 11:38.281
one of these
will lead to The Ghost.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.701
Yeah, you know, uh, Meyer,
unfortunately,

11:41.743 --> 11:43.703
uh, Murray and I can't join

11:43.745 --> 11:46.289
because tomorrow is
our daughter Amy's wedding.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.543
I thought I was getting
her hand in marriage.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.686
- You promised.
- Have you heard about this?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.045
Had no idea.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.297
- Get out.
- This is outrageous.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.298
Just get out.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.508
Stood up again.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.593
Listen, uh, boychick,

11:58.635 --> 12:01.596
you've got a very good head,
uh, for this kind of stuff.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.016
Not as good as mine, but I can't
seem to be able to figure out

12:05.058 --> 12:07.185
what the heck else
they were communicating

12:07.227 --> 12:08.728
in this music mishegas.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.772
So maybe you could give it
a shot for me, huh?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.983
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'll try not to show you up.

12:13.024 --> 12:16.111
Yeah, thank you,
but we're kind of counting on it

12:16.153 --> 12:18.363
that you do, hmm?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.365
- Okay.
- All right.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.717
Come on, this is
the third fucking bite

12:21.741 --> 12:22.909
you got out of me this week.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.578
I'm not Meals on Wheels.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.580
Give me something
on Offerman I can use.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.874
I told you I did a couple
profiles on the guy.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.625
Oh, my G...

12:30.667 --> 12:33.295
Then, when I needed him most,
he disappeared on me, all right?

12:33.336 --> 12:35.297
You happy? Sweet guy.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.132
Hope he gets cancer
of the balls.

12:37.174 --> 12:39.968
- You needed him for what?
- He came to me a year ago,

12:40.010 --> 12:42.679
spinning some yarn that he'd
spotted an old Nazi war criminal

12:42.721 --> 12:44.431
at Gristedes on the Upper East.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.558
I thought Offerman's cataracts
must have gotten worse

12:46.600 --> 12:47.976
until I looked into it.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.936
- Turns out, he was right.
- Mm-hmm.

12:49.978 --> 12:54.149
I tried to write a story,
expose the Nazi bastard,

12:54.191 --> 12:56.359
then my whole
fucking life imploded.

12:56.401 --> 12:59.362
The Nazi in the supermarket,
was his name Hans Fischer?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.364
How'd you know that?

13:01.406 --> 13:05.994
Did Meyer ever allude
to wanting to get revenge?

13:06.036 --> 13:08.205
- You know, to kill him?
- What? No.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.373
Meyer came to me specifically
to expose the guy,

13:10.415 --> 13:12.626
and when I started looking
into the Gristedes Nazi,

13:12.667 --> 13:15.587
- I found another one.
- Gretel Fischer?

13:15.629 --> 13:18.548
How the fuck did you know that?

13:18.590 --> 13:22.219
It was you. You were the one
who went to NASA about her.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.262
Weren't you?

13:27.390 --> 13:29.392
Did Meyer find out
about her, too?

13:29.434 --> 13:32.896
What, you think he's fucking
Shylock Holmes, Jew detective?

13:32.938 --> 13:35.899
I think he had
these Nazis killed.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.486
You're trying to cuff
the old Jew?

13:39.528 --> 13:42.822
- He's the least of your worries.
- How many?

13:42.864 --> 13:44.824
How many Nazis did you find?

13:44.866 --> 13:46.826
Thousands.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.621
There are thousands of them.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.123
Come on, man, I thought
you worked for the Times,

13:52.165 --> 13:53.750
not the fucking
National Enquirer.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.378
I have a source
who can prove it.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.089
I gave that story
to my publisher.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.067
Couple days later,
a folder was found in my office

14:01.091 --> 14:02.676
with photos of young boys.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.261
Pornographic photos.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.889
My fiancée found
similar ones in our house.

14:07.931 --> 14:12.894
I tried to explain, but no one...
No one... believed me.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.854
I went to Offerman,
begged him to help me out,

14:14.896 --> 14:17.232
He-he could've done something.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.318
But he just

14:20.360 --> 14:23.446
pretended like
he didn't even know me.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.865
Like we never even spoke.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.078
Look, if you can
really prove this,

14:30.120 --> 14:34.207
if you have a...
a credible resource...

14:35.250 --> 14:37.252
you got to introduce me.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.257
I can help.
I can expose them, Danny.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.467
I can help you finish
your story.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.178
Come on. You can't let
everything that happened to you

14:47.220 --> 14:49.222
be all for nothing.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.276
We're only going to be
in Alabama for one fucking day.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.986
Hurry up.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.786
Gonif.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.371
What are you doing in here?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.209
Give me that.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.004
Whose is that?

16:03.046 --> 16:05.507
I thought only boys wear Chais.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.509
It belonged to your grandfather.

16:07.550 --> 16:11.888
He gave it to me, and it's not
for you to play with.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.766
What else did you take?

16:19.938 --> 16:23.942
Shanda.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.739
Hey, there's a girl at the door.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.950
Get rid of her.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.619
You want her to end up
like your friend?

16:38.581 --> 16:41.418
- So...
- So.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.461
So, you gonna tell me
where the hell you've been?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.880
I've been here.
What? I've been around.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.301
That's bullshit, Jonah.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.346
Okay? I know when you're around.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.270
You missed Booty's funeral.

17:01.479 --> 17:02.897
What the fuck?

17:02.939 --> 17:04.739
Maybe I've had enough funerals
for one summer.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.861
Maybe, uh, I'm dealing
with my own shit.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.612
- Okay?
- You lied

17:09.654 --> 17:12.782
to that detective about seeing
the guy who killed Booty.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.160
Then some FBI agent came
around here asking about you,

17:15.201 --> 17:18.163
so what the hell is going on?

17:19.414 --> 17:20.999
I'm worried about you.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.417
Yeah, th... you... don't.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.627
Don't be. I-I'm swell.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.838
Give me a break.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.275
You know, w... you know, worry
about OPEC. Worry about famine.

17:29.299 --> 17:32.177
Worry about the next fucking
douchebag y-you're gonna date.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.804
Just give me some space,
all right?

17:34.846 --> 17:37.849
- Fuck.
- Why are you being like this?

17:37.891 --> 17:40.435
'Cause I've been freaking out,

17:40.477 --> 17:44.856
thinking the worst, picturing
you in a fucking coffin.

17:44.898 --> 17:48.818
And you think now is the time
to bring up Dennis?

17:48.860 --> 17:52.238
An ex-boyfriend I dated
for ten seconds?

17:52.280 --> 17:55.366
Yeah, well, herpes are forever.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.681
Oh, shit, ducky.

18:18.723 --> 18:22.519
No more Noxzema wank jobs
for you, huh?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.521
Noxzema?

18:24.562 --> 18:26.940
Noxzema would sting.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.109
Relationships are
weak spots, Jonah.

18:30.151 --> 18:34.239
A lone wolf is dangerous
because it has no pack.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.534
Nothing to protect,
nothing to lose.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.119
All of us have had to do
what you just did.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.164
- And trust me, it does get...
- Easier?

18:43.206 --> 18:45.708
Oh, no, lad, harder.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.086
Worlds harder.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.673
Time to go, love.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.759
♪ Those good times
were no good at all ♪

18:54.801 --> 18:56.553
♪ There were bad times ♪

18:56.594 --> 18:58.555
♪ We would start to fall ♪

18:58.596 --> 19:00.139
♪ We had fast times ♪

19:00.181 --> 19:03.977
♪ And we just don't need
it all. ♪

19:32.881 --> 19:35.633
I'm a fucking delivery boy?

19:35.675 --> 19:39.262
- I think I graduated from that.
- Yeah?

19:39.304 --> 19:42.056
- Think again.
- What about the bank?

19:42.098 --> 19:44.475
I heard Fredrich Hauser
killed himself.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.312
That's not your concern.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.899
Your concern is following
my orders.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.903
And taking that bag
to that address.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.113
I hope you can handle that.

19:57.155 --> 20:01.075
It's a really, really big job.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.559
Is it him?

20:26.601 --> 20:29.479
I can't tell.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.069
Jesus Christ.

20:36.110 --> 20:38.696
This sick fuck did experiments
on Jews with seawater.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.699
Why seawater?

20:41.741 --> 20:45.662
Well, most Luftwaffe airmen
died not from being shot down

20:45.703 --> 20:48.665
but from exposure when
they parachuted into the sea.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.709
The Nazis needed to find a way
to prolong life in the ocean,

20:51.751 --> 20:54.170
so they used Jews as lab rats.

20:54.212 --> 20:57.006
"He forced them to ingest
gallons of salt water.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.633
"Siphoned it down their throats

20:58.675 --> 21:03.429
"until their bellies distended
and their organs failed.

21:03.471 --> 21:05.848
"They drowned in their own
bodies, and he kept going,

21:05.890 --> 21:08.893
even when he knew
he'd never find a solution."

21:37.630 --> 21:40.466
Shit, Jonah.
Looks like you're up.

22:00.737 --> 22:04.365
Well, howdy.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.748
Do you want a drink?

22:11.789 --> 22:14.876
- Or food?
- No.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.921
I already ate.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.427
Well, then, this is your party.

22:24.469 --> 22:28.389
- Let's get to the cake.
- Okay.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.808
You don't seem to appreciate

22:30.850 --> 22:35.021
just how integral I am
to our mission.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.857
You can't do this without me.

22:37.899 --> 22:40.485
Don't be so sure.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.488
Now undo that childish thing
you did,

22:43.529 --> 22:46.491
tanking the bill.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.493
We need those sanctions
lifted immediately.

22:48.534 --> 22:52.497
We can't delay our delivery from
South America a single day more.

22:54.082 --> 22:58.461
First, you must
guarantee my safety,

22:58.503 --> 23:03.132
and second, I'm done
going through you.

23:03.174 --> 23:06.552
I want a meeting
with The General.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.601
Aim lower.

23:15.061 --> 23:19.232
I alone have the ear
of the peanut farmer.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.859
So you will do what I ask.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.529
Nicht kleckern,
sondern klotzen, eh?

23:28.407 --> 23:33.371
Here they say,
"Go big or go home."

23:34.831 --> 23:37.375
You do your part, Liebling,

23:37.416 --> 23:39.043
and I'll see what I can do.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.427
- I have bad news, Lon.
- It's not gonna happen.

23:48.469 --> 23:49.595
Dreyfuss wanted the part.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.056
Richard fucking Dreyfuss?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.600
Jesus!

23:54.642 --> 23:57.812
Did you see his face in Jaws

23:57.854 --> 23:59.647
when he was showing
his scars to Quint?

23:59.689 --> 24:01.399
Like he was holding in a fart.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.109
He's really hot right now.

24:03.151 --> 24:06.279
And to be honest, maybe not
enough time has passed

24:06.320 --> 24:08.823
between the old Lonny and now.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.449
Christ, Dave,
I've been in the program.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.077
I'm... I've been good.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.705
I haven't been
in the Enquirer or anything.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.957
We'll get 'em next time.
Okay, kid?

24:19.584 --> 24:23.004
Yeah. Next time.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.639
Dreyfuss is banging twins
in Malibu,

24:33.681 --> 24:35.683
and I'm here with this shit.

24:59.207 --> 25:02.126
Hello? Can I help you?

25:03.377 --> 25:05.838
Uh...

25:05.880 --> 25:07.798
Yes?

25:09.884 --> 25:11.844
Yes?

25:11.886 --> 25:14.055
Uh, happy Fourth of July, sir.

25:14.096 --> 25:17.975
Uh, I'm-I'm from
the Young Republicans club.

25:18.017 --> 25:22.396
And, uh, well, we love America
365 days of the year.

25:22.438 --> 25:26.317
Um, I just brought a petition
because we are hoping

25:26.359 --> 25:28.319
to keep the flags up
all the time,

25:28.361 --> 25:30.529
not just on Independence Day.

25:30.571 --> 25:34.158
Uh... uh, would you be
willing to sign?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.786
What organization did you say
you're from again?

25:36.827 --> 25:40.539
The-the, uh,
Young Republicans Club?

25:40.581 --> 25:43.501
It's... a hot day.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.502
- Dad?
- Huh?

25:44.543 --> 25:47.421
Oh, hi, happy Fourth.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.090
Yeah. Uh, uh, yeah.
Happy Fourth.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.943
Dad, did you buy the sparklers
for the party tonight?

25:50.967 --> 25:53.719
- I don't see 'em.
- O-Oh.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.514
Ah, I forgot.
Do we really need them?

25:56.555 --> 25:59.141
Okay. Okay, okay.
I-I-I'll-I'll get them.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.185
Come. Come, come.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.272
Um, uh...

26:04.313 --> 26:05.791
Can-can-can I please get
your signature?

26:05.815 --> 26:07.817
Please?

26:13.322 --> 26:15.324
Thank you.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.749
Same "E."

26:23.791 --> 26:26.168
- Same "R."
Uh-uh.
Finger off the trigger.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.379
Two hands, push, pull.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.006
- There you go.
- Push...

26:30.047 --> 26:32.216
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.884
- There you go.
- Ah.

26:33.926 --> 26:38.723
Gentlemen, we have verified
Dieter Zweigelt,

26:38.764 --> 26:42.727
also known as Victor Dillman,
Nazi scientist,

26:42.768 --> 26:45.730
medical experimenter
of Auschwitz,

26:45.771 --> 26:47.857
and lieutenant of The Ghost.

26:47.898 --> 26:51.110
Yes. Bing-fucking-o, right?

26:53.988 --> 26:56.198
When it gets dark,
we'll come back for him.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.083
Everything set for the big day?

27:06.125 --> 27:08.919
Oh, yeah, the flowers, the cake,
the band... big band.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.297
Murray, would you stop
with the band already?

27:11.339 --> 27:14.300
Why must we have
an eight-piece band?

27:14.342 --> 27:16.844
You really can't do
without the fakakta oboe?

27:16.886 --> 27:18.238
We'll talk
about that later, Murray.

27:18.262 --> 27:21.015
I'm sure it will be
a beautiful event.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.850
- Thank you.
- Yes.

27:22.892 --> 27:25.603
But, uh, perhaps now
is the time for me

27:25.644 --> 27:29.148
to address the elephant
in the kitchen.

27:29.190 --> 27:33.110
Mindy, you are a force
for good in the shul.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.528
Thank you.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.948
But, Murray,
I am a guest in your home.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.868
Hashem would smite me
if I didn't at least try.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.287
Why don't you come to services?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.706
We would love to see you there.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.584
No disrespect, Rabbi,
not my cup of borscht.

27:48.626 --> 27:50.211
Why don't we take

27:50.252 --> 27:53.798
some coffee and dessert
in the living room?

27:53.839 --> 27:55.841
- Excellent idea.
- Sure. It's delicious.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.843
- Delicious.
- Come, yeah, and take the chair.

27:57.885 --> 27:59.678
- Uh, Murray?
- Yeah.

27:59.720 --> 28:04.683
Uh, you have endured
tremendous suffering

28:04.725 --> 28:08.229
in-in your life, and, uh,

28:08.270 --> 28:12.942
God does not always
make his answers

28:12.983 --> 28:15.194
easy for us to understand.

28:15.236 --> 28:18.072
I-If I may,
with your permission,

28:18.114 --> 28:21.075
I-I, I would like to tell you
a small story.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.493
- Oh, please.
- Sure, sure.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.495
Okay... I don't want that.

28:24.537 --> 28:25.913
- Um...
- Yeah.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.542
A poor Jewish farmer

28:29.583 --> 28:32.336
lived in a tiny house

28:32.378 --> 28:35.881
with his wife and six children.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.092
It was misery.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.094
So, one day,
he runs to the rabbi,

28:40.136 --> 28:42.304
ah, to explain
how terrible things were.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.349
And the wise old rabbi
says, "Ah.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.560
"I know just what to do.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.770
"I want you to go home

28:49.812 --> 28:52.773
"and take all the animals
on your farm

28:52.815 --> 28:55.151
"and bring them
into the house with you.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.195
God will bless you."

28:58.237 --> 29:01.240
The man is skeptical, but,
uh, he doe... he goes home,

29:01.282 --> 29:04.410
he takes his animals and he
brings them into his house.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.829
The next day,
he runs to the temple.

29:06.871 --> 29:09.415
"Rabbi, it's worse.

29:09.457 --> 29:12.251
"We're stuffed like sardines.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.670
"The chickens defecate
on the children.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.840
"The goats are eating
everything in sight.

29:17.882 --> 29:19.049
It's no good."

29:19.091 --> 29:20.843
The rabbi says,

29:20.885 --> 29:26.474
"Okay, I want you to go home
and take out all the animals."

29:26.515 --> 29:29.477
And the man said, "Oh,
and then God will bless me?"

29:29.518 --> 29:34.356
And the rabbi said,
"Yes. 100% blessed."

29:34.398 --> 29:37.693
And, uh, then?
Wh-What happened then?

29:37.735 --> 29:42.323
The next day,
the man had a smile on his face

29:42.364 --> 29:47.161
as bright as a menorah
on the eighth day.

29:47.203 --> 29:50.581
"Rabbi," he said,
"life is so good.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.583
"It's so quiet.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.585
"We have room to spare.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.587
It's a joy."

29:56.629 --> 29:58.214
You see, Murray? I...

29:58.255 --> 30:01.342
Y-You understand
the meaning of my story?

30:01.383 --> 30:06.680
U-Uh, sometimes in our trials
and trauma,

30:06.722 --> 30:12.394
w-we don't understand
that we are also blessed.

30:12.436 --> 30:17.233
Sometimes we miss God's signs.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.904
That's a good one, Rabbi.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.368
Excuse me.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.995
Excuse me, uh...

30:30.037 --> 30:32.122
I-I leave it to you to decipher

30:32.164 --> 30:34.416
if this is a sign
from God or not.

30:34.458 --> 30:38.170
But I urgently have
to drain the snake.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.759
You have snakes?

30:45.970 --> 30:48.180
You're certain?

30:48.222 --> 30:50.099
It was this old Jew?

30:50.140 --> 30:51.100
Yes.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.601
He was Hauser's
last appointment.

30:54.812 --> 30:59.066
Wonder how that kike jumped
out of the oven...

30:59.108 --> 31:00.818
No matter.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.778
We will tuck him back in,
soon enough.

31:02.820 --> 31:06.115
Follow him.
His car is a weak spot.

31:12.413 --> 31:16.000
Hi, everyone.
Thank you for coming.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.294
I'm your host Karen Ballinger.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.130
Some of you are
longtime friends.

31:21.171 --> 31:23.024
You all know that I've worked
for a lot of politicians

31:23.048 --> 31:27.428
in my time, but no one
I believe in more

31:27.469 --> 31:29.388
than Doug Buckman.

31:31.098 --> 31:35.769
Doug and I are dedicated
to the conservative principle

31:35.811 --> 31:38.897
of hard work.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.609
There were no welfare queens
when we were kids.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.486
Hear, hear.

31:44.528 --> 31:48.991
But right now there's a war
for the soul of our country,

31:49.033 --> 31:51.952
and all Doug and I
care about is...

31:51.994 --> 31:54.371
putting America first.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.706
Excuse me.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.291
We must remain self-sufficient.

31:57.333 --> 31:58.709
Excuse me!

31:58.751 --> 31:59.793
Yes?

31:59.835 --> 32:00.919
Is she the caterer?

32:00.961 --> 32:03.047
So you're saying

32:03.088 --> 32:05.341
that every person should
pull themselves up

32:05.382 --> 32:07.551
by their boot straps, right?

32:07.593 --> 32:10.804
But not every person can afford
a pair of boots.

32:10.846 --> 32:15.684
Okay, but the government
can't take you shoe shopping.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.605
Is it fair your wages pay
for someone's chicken wings?

32:19.647 --> 32:22.733
Someone who's watching The
Jeffersons instead of working?

32:22.775 --> 32:25.361
- Of course not.
- E-E-Excuse me,

32:25.402 --> 32:26.820
that makes no sense.

32:26.862 --> 32:29.740
Sympathy leads to handouts.

32:29.782 --> 32:33.410
And capable people become fleas
on society's back.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.038
- And whom does that help?
- By "fleas"

32:36.080 --> 32:38.874
and "chicken wings" and the
motherfucking Jeffersons,

32:38.916 --> 32:42.419
you obviously mean black people.

32:42.461 --> 32:46.048
So why not just say,
"Hey, the government

32:46.090 --> 32:48.258
shouldn't help black people."

32:48.300 --> 32:50.236
Bet you'd get more money
out of these nice white folks.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.930
Throw her out of here.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.473
Why don't you try?

32:54.515 --> 32:56.266
I'll shove that cane up your ass

32:56.308 --> 32:58.143
till you're the world's
nastiest lollipop.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.311
Get the fuck off of me!

32:59.353 --> 33:00.312
Offensive.

33:00.354 --> 33:01.980
Touch me.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.608
Whoa.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.278
I certainly love
a spirited debate.

33:27.131 --> 33:30.259
Sorry, wasn't done with you yet.

33:45.399 --> 33:48.110
And what is with the baby face
and the suit?

33:48.152 --> 33:49.737
I don't want to be recognized.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.322
Plus, my ex liked the beard,
and fuck her.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.366
Can I get a whiskey?

34:05.878 --> 34:08.464
Did anyone see me?

34:08.505 --> 34:10.466
Think you pulled it off, 007.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.925
Thanks.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.178
And thanks for believing me,

34:14.219 --> 34:16.138
- since you're kind of
the only one.
- Sure.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.891
- Thank you for trusting me.
- Oh, no. God, no.

34:18.932 --> 34:21.351
I don't trust you.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.411
Danny, would you do it again?

34:39.453 --> 34:42.289
Knowing what happens and all?

34:48.170 --> 34:49.963
No.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.971
All right, all right, let's go.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.240
- We gonna start?
- Can I do it?

34:59.264 --> 35:00.474
I really want to.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.810
Be my guest.

35:02.851 --> 35:05.395
Wake the fuck up, bitch!

35:05.437 --> 35:08.774
Tilda Sauer, hello.

35:08.816 --> 35:13.111
Aw, fascists are so cute
when they first wake up.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.696
What is this?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.031
Look at her.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.158
Who are you?
Who are you people?

35:18.200 --> 35:21.829
Those are some very deep,
existential questions

35:21.870 --> 35:24.081
for a fucking Nazi.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.625
Tilda Sauer.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.837
Devotee of Joseph Goebbels.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.965
You sowed hate
through propaganda.

35:33.006 --> 35:36.885
You spread vile, false stories
through false news.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.011
Here you are.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.931
That's not me.
I'm Belgian.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.349
Belgian?

35:42.391 --> 35:44.017
Fonferer.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.520
You lie to our faces.

35:46.562 --> 35:49.231
You've been spewing
this horseshit your whole life.

35:49.273 --> 35:50.691
What are you talking about?

35:50.732 --> 35:54.695
And tonight...
unless we hear the truth,

35:54.736 --> 35:56.822
you're gonna eat some.

35:56.864 --> 36:00.784
- Yo, this is seriously gross.
- Yeah.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.954
Okay, we start the film now.

36:09.001 --> 36:13.213
- What is this?
- Your handiwork, Tilda.

36:13.255 --> 36:15.382
You've got the wrong person.

36:15.424 --> 36:18.677
- I have nothing to do with that.
- Oh...

36:18.719 --> 36:20.637
think that's lie number one.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.931
Oh, yes, I think it is.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.975
No. No! Aah!

36:25.017 --> 36:27.102
Oh, my! Oh, my...

36:27.144 --> 36:29.813
Come on! This shirt is silk!

36:29.855 --> 36:31.773
Oh, this is awful.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.652
Let me translate your words.

36:35.694 --> 36:40.490
"We will fight the infestation
of world Jewry.

36:40.532 --> 36:44.953
"They are nothing
but rats and roaches

36:44.995 --> 36:49.750
who direct their brutal greed
towards true Germans."

36:49.791 --> 36:52.336
Real Emily fucking Dickinson.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.379
Hut, hut, hut!

36:54.421 --> 36:56.340
Tell us one truth.

36:56.381 --> 37:01.303
Tell us where Oskar Hauptman is.

37:01.345 --> 37:03.639
Where is The Ghost?

37:03.680 --> 37:05.098
Where is your paramour?

37:05.140 --> 37:07.643
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

37:07.684 --> 37:10.187
Yes, you do. You completely know
what we're talking about.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.189
- Go ahead, Lonny.
- Here comes the airplane.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.399
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Here it comes.

37:14.441 --> 37:15.400
Open up!

37:15.442 --> 37:16.944
Ah, there it is!

37:16.985 --> 37:19.279
Come on, lady, tell us
what we need to know.

37:19.321 --> 37:20.405
MEYER Again.

37:20.447 --> 37:21.740
Oh. Oh!

37:21.782 --> 37:24.201
She's ready for more.
Or are you ready to speak?

37:24.242 --> 37:26.119
Who are you?

37:26.161 --> 37:27.871
I want to know who you are!

37:27.913 --> 37:29.706
I'm Karen Ballinger!

37:29.748 --> 37:31.249
I know who I am!

37:31.291 --> 37:35.087
That's right, Tilda Sauer!

37:35.128 --> 37:36.588
Tilda Sauer!

37:36.630 --> 37:39.800
- I know who I am.
- You're Tilda Sauer.

37:39.841 --> 37:41.969
Do it again.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.973
Again and again and again
till we loosen the screws

37:46.014 --> 37:47.265
in the back of her tongue.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.601
I beg you, please...

37:49.643 --> 37:51.937
Don't look at me like I'm
your fucking soul sister.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.313
- Come on.
- No!

37:57.484 --> 37:59.653
Have you had enough?

37:59.695 --> 38:01.238
'Cause there's more.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.547
Guess he went back
for more sparklers.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.801
Wait, wait, wait, we're still...

38:22.843 --> 38:24.553
Whole fucking town is here.

38:24.594 --> 38:27.889
He's here. He's verified.
We go.

38:27.931 --> 38:30.308

40:31.429 --> 40:32.806
Don't fucking move.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.937
Put the fucking knife down.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.063
Put it down.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.189
Put the fucking thing down.

40:41.231 --> 40:42.899
Joe, come on.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.360
Keep fucking walking or I'll
blow your fucking brains out.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.154
Come on.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.577
Madam Secretary?

40:55.078 --> 40:57.289
You look lovely.

40:57.330 --> 40:58.790
Glad I caught you.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.750
Fourth of July dinner
with the VP.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.878
But I hate heels.

41:02.919 --> 41:06.006
On a list of benefits
of being born with a penis,

41:06.047 --> 41:09.009
not having to wear heels
is in the top three.

41:10.385 --> 41:13.847
Uh, thank you for the other day,
but I think I might've let

41:13.889 --> 41:17.392
my emotions cloud
my better judgment.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.688
I made a mistake asking you
to do that, Juanita.

41:21.730 --> 41:24.441
Lifting sanctions is...

41:24.482 --> 41:27.068
is really the right choice.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.904
Are you kidding?
You said...

41:28.945 --> 41:30.906
And I'm simply mortified.

41:30.947 --> 41:35.035
I got caught up in it all,
but, gosh darn it,

41:35.076 --> 41:38.538
we're better off working
with the dictators down there.

41:38.580 --> 41:42.125
'Cause if we don't,
the commies will.

41:42.167 --> 41:45.420
And allowing commies
into our neck of the woods,

41:45.462 --> 41:47.547
well, that wouldn't
look too good

41:47.589 --> 41:49.049
for our president, would it?

41:49.090 --> 41:52.344
You want me to go back to Carter
and fucking flip-flop?

41:52.385 --> 41:53.470
Why?!

41:53.511 --> 41:57.807
This is 100% my fault,
Juanita, no question.

41:57.849 --> 42:02.187
Although ultimately,
if we don't lift the sanctions

42:02.229 --> 42:04.940
and the Russians do get
a toehold,

42:04.981 --> 42:10.654
I suppose he'll probably lay
100% of the blame on you.

42:10.695 --> 42:15.575
You small-balled son of a bitch.

42:15.617 --> 42:18.245
I'm just finally
thinking clearly

42:18.286 --> 42:22.207
after my... my trauma.

42:23.250 --> 42:25.335
I meant what I said.

42:25.377 --> 42:28.546
Lottie did so admire you.

42:28.588 --> 42:31.258
But what she really
would have wanted...

42:31.299 --> 42:34.636
is what's best for America.

42:37.055 --> 42:40.892
Have a nice dinner,
Madam Secretary.

42:40.934 --> 42:44.688
I'm not changing shit
for that snake.

42:44.729 --> 42:51.319
Once everything is in place, I
need you back here immediately.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.994
She needs me back.

43:00.954 --> 43:02.664
You know what to do.

43:14.718 --> 43:16.511
Victor Dillman.

43:16.553 --> 43:20.307
Or should I say Dieter Zweigelt?

43:20.348 --> 43:23.184
Doctor of Auschwitz, torturer,

43:23.226 --> 43:25.186
murderer.

43:25.228 --> 43:28.565
Tonight your sins, it seems,
have caught up with you.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.608
That was, that was during a war.

43:30.650 --> 43:32.360
I-I'm not the same man anymore.

43:32.402 --> 43:34.029
Oh, right, you're an angel now,
are you?

43:34.070 --> 43:35.710
You help little, old ladies
cross the road

43:35.739 --> 43:37.741
and you shit Cadbury Creme Eggs.

43:37.782 --> 43:41.286
You want to live, you talk.

43:41.328 --> 43:44.164
Oskar Hauptman, The Ghost,

43:44.205 --> 43:46.249
- where is he?
- Hauptman? I-I have no idea.

43:56.092 --> 43:58.011
No, no, no, no, please.

43:58.053 --> 44:00.180
I-I have a family. Please.

44:00.221 --> 44:03.767
Please. Okay, okay.

44:03.808 --> 44:05.185
A couple of years ago,

44:05.226 --> 44:07.729
he did come around to me.

44:07.771 --> 44:09.189
He was in America.

44:09.230 --> 44:11.858
A-And he was Director
of Medical Engineering

44:11.900 --> 44:15.612
at a, at a lab in Maryland.
Edgewood.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.155
The military research facility?

44:17.197 --> 44:20.575
What did he want from you?

44:20.617 --> 44:22.619
He was close
to a weapon that was

44:22.660 --> 44:24.371
more powerful
than an atomic bomb.

44:24.412 --> 44:26.873
He-he was building a team.
He-he wanted his trusted

44:26.915 --> 44:29.376
lieutenants close by to help.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.252
What sort of weapon?
Nuclear? Chemical?

44:31.294 --> 44:33.129
I... I-I don't know.

44:33.171 --> 44:34.464
I-I told him no right away.

44:34.506 --> 44:36.674
I mean, I-I've had
a good life here.

44:36.716 --> 44:39.761
I-I-I didn't want
to jeopardize it.

44:39.803 --> 44:41.471
How'd you even sneak
into the country?

44:41.513 --> 44:42.680
Sneak?

44:42.722 --> 44:45.683
No. I... I was invited.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.102
I was brought here

44:47.143 --> 44:50.814
to-to help your science programs
by the CIA.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.732
- CIA?
- Yes!

44:52.774 --> 44:54.150
We fucking brought them here?

44:54.192 --> 44:56.945
After the war,
it was, it was chaos.

44:56.986 --> 44:59.614
But the Americans
and the Soviets,

44:59.656 --> 45:01.783
they were on the eve
of their own war,

45:01.825 --> 45:04.786
and they made a play
for the most valuable

45:04.828 --> 45:08.248
of resources from the Reich.

45:08.289 --> 45:09.999
They wanted our minds.

45:12.961 --> 45:14.546
And-and-and the Russians,

45:14.587 --> 45:17.465
they threatened death
if we didn't go with them,

45:17.507 --> 45:21.469
but the Americans,
they-they offered...

45:21.511 --> 45:22.887
they offered life.

45:22.929 --> 45:26.349
My-my whole lab
w-w-was recruited.

45:26.391 --> 45:29.018
They gave us American names
and American homes.

45:29.060 --> 45:32.147
They gave us jobs in, in-in
the space program, NASA.

45:32.188 --> 45:35.650
We-we built lives
and-and-and families.

45:35.692 --> 45:37.819
I mean, we're citizens.

45:37.861 --> 45:39.988

-Bullshit.
-Well, it's true.

you got to the moon?

45:43.158 --> 45:46.828

our biologists.

45:46.870 --> 45:48.746
I mean, we-we-we, we helped you.

45:48.788 --> 45:51.958
NASA, just like Gretel.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.252
So NASA's filled
with fucking Nazis?

45:54.294 --> 45:56.629
Where is the rest of your lab?

45:56.671 --> 45:58.548
Are any of them here tonight?

46:03.094 --> 46:05.388
Give us names,

46:05.430 --> 46:08.850
or I will cut this off
your face and feed it to a duck.

46:08.892 --> 46:11.019

46:43.218 --> 46:44.761
The head Nazi surgeon?

46:44.802 --> 46:46.763
I have no idea where he is.

46:46.804 --> 46:50.099
Did you say Moritz Ehrlich?

Yes, yes.

52:09.794 --> 52:12.046
You're an echo in a well.

52:12.088 --> 52:14.215
A shadow in the dark.

52:14.257 --> 52:17.260
No one sees you.
You-you know why?

52:17.301 --> 52:19.554
Because there's nothing to see.

52:19.595 --> 52:21.764

52:28.145 --> 52:31.941
Do you think these men,
they care about you?

52:31.983 --> 52:36.487
They use you
for your black skin.

52:36.529 --> 52:37.947
And when they're done with you,

52:37.989 --> 52:39.740
they'll throw you back
into the ghetto.

52:39.782 --> 52:44.370
If the ghetto will even
take you anymore.

52:44.412 --> 52:47.957
- That's enough.
- And you.

What the fuck did you just do?

53:07.476 --> 53:09.770
She... We-we... She...
We didn't verify her!

53:09.812 --> 53:12.106
She didn't even
tell us anything.

53:12.148 --> 53:14.775
She could've known something,
Meyer. She could've given us

53:14.817 --> 53:18.195
- something on The Ghost
and you just...
- She knew nothing.

53:18.237 --> 53:21.324
Just how to pour poison
into our ears.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.910
That's all she knew.

53:23.951 --> 53:25.536

53:49.310 --> 53:52.355
I'm gonna...
I'll check the office.

53:57.735 --> 54:00.154
They were calculated
in how they discredited me.

54:00.196 --> 54:01.924
- They knew they had to ruin me.
- That is rough.

54:01.948 --> 54:04.241
