DEATHSTRIKE:
I want what that
creature took from me.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.125
Use the motion trackers
to follow him.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.833
(BEEPING)

01:36.833 --> 01:41.833
No one steals from
Lady Deathstrike
and lives.

01:49.958 --> 01:53.250
Callisto! Look!
Leech has it.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.000
Well done.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.875
With this device, I shall
unlock our alien treasure.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.875
I shall have its power,

02:00.875 --> 02:04.416
enough to become
the true leader of
the Morlocks again.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.958
DEATHSTRIKE: Intruders!

02:09.000 --> 02:12.958
Stop them, Morlocks.
They must not reach
the hidden tunnel.

(SCREAMS)

02:31.708 --> 02:33.208
(ROARS)

02:42.833 --> 02:46.750
You cannot have my prize.
I shall be leader again.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.000
No!

02:50.166 --> 02:53.083
How...
How does it work?

02:53.083 --> 02:54.875
Help.

02:54.875 --> 03:00.416
Tell me, why should I spare
your miserable life, thief?

03:00.416 --> 03:03.583
Callisto make Leech
steal from your lab.

03:03.583 --> 03:07.000
She think we open
buried treasure with it.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.208
Tell me more
about this treasure.

03:10.208 --> 03:13.416
Leech don't know more.
The Morlocks can't open it.

03:13.416 --> 03:15.833
(STAMMERING) It's in there.

03:15.833 --> 03:20.208
This treasure
had better be worth
the trouble you caused me.

03:20.208 --> 03:21.458
(GASPS)

03:31.166 --> 03:34.500
(GASPS) A spacecraft.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.625
It must have been
buried for centuries.

03:37.958 --> 03:41.458

03:41.458 --> 03:45.583
What technology
could send a ship
across the galaxy?

03:45.583 --> 03:49.416
Odd. I can feel its power.

03:49.416 --> 03:53.125
Perhaps now,
after all my work,

03:53.125 --> 03:56.458
I shall
have the means
to exact my revenge.

03:58.125 --> 04:03.500

04:12.208 --> 04:13.583

04:25.708 --> 04:27.250
Such power.

04:27.250 --> 04:30.583
It's like nothing
I've ever sensed before.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.000
I must discover its origin.

04:38.416 --> 04:42.416
(SCREAMING)

04:44.458 --> 04:45.708
(PANTING)

04:45.708 --> 04:47.333
What happened, Deathstrike?

04:47.333 --> 04:50.708
(GASPING) A defensive field
around the ship.

04:50.708 --> 04:54.708
It reacted with my
cyborg components.

04:54.708 --> 04:57.291
My circuits were on fire.

04:57.291 --> 04:59.708
Then
we'll just have
to blast our way in.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.375
No.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.875
Fool, you might destroy it.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.708
I pay you to fight,
not to think.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.583
The Morlocks
were able to
touch it.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.500
And my adamantium
talons scratched it.

05:13.500 --> 05:18.875
Perhaps what we need is
a human with a set of
adamantium claws.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.458
Make your move, hotshot.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.708
You lost, Wolverine.
Admit it.

05:25.708 --> 05:28.625
(CHUCKLES) Big talk.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.583
Come on.
Go for the hoop, Gumbo.

05:31.583 --> 05:32.583
If you insist.

05:36.375 --> 05:37.875
Hey. Message coming in.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.875

Nobody's picking up.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.208
Looks like we're it.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.166
Hello.

05:46.166 --> 05:50.375
Man, we gotta talk to Storm
about who she gives our
number to.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.958
Shh! Wolverine!

05:52.958 --> 05:54.750
Storm isn't here, Leech.

05:54.750 --> 05:58.166
Don't want to talk to
X-Man leader of Morlocks.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.000
Leech
got message
for Wolverine.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.458
Spit it out.

06:02.458 --> 06:05.000
We were in
the middle
of a game.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.250
Message is from Yuriko.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.458
Yuriko.

06:09.458 --> 06:12.958
She says tell you
she in Morlock tunnels.

06:12.958 --> 06:15.125
(STAMMERING) She needs you.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.708
Come back here,
you little sneak thief.

06:18.708 --> 06:22.375
He come now.
You'll see, he come.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.125
You let me go now?

06:24.125 --> 06:25.750
You did well.

06:25.750 --> 06:29.375
Too bad,
your usefulness has ended.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.750
Dispose of this garbage.

06:31.750 --> 06:35.125
No. No, please.
Leech do what you say.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.708
Wolverine will come.

06:41.708 --> 06:44.875
We must make
our preparations.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.458
Who's Yuriko?

06:50.458 --> 06:53.958
Somebody I used to
know a long time ago.

06:53.958 --> 06:55.875
This whole thing stink.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.583
Why Leech call
instead of Callisto?

06:58.583 --> 07:01.000
Gambit's nose
say it a trap.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.583
Doesn't matter.
I got to go.

07:03.583 --> 07:05.458
Wait, we'll go with you.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.875
No way.
This is personal.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.416
Everything personal
with that one.

07:11.416 --> 07:14.083
We've got to follow him.
He might need our help.

07:14.083 --> 07:17.458
Wolverine a big boy.
He can take care of
himself.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.500
The X-Men are
my family now,

07:19.500 --> 07:21.833
and members of
a family help
each other.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.166
I'm going to
help Wolverine.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.708
You know he'd help you.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.750
Family, ha!

07:27.750 --> 07:30.500
This family
nothing but trouble.

08:23.833 --> 08:27.166

Are you really
down here, Yuriko?

08:27.166 --> 08:29.708
Tell me it is
not so, Logan.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.166
Tell me you
are not leaving.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.583
I wouldn't go if
I didn't have to.

08:34.583 --> 08:37.500
But some guys in Canada
need to see me.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.500
They're not the kind
of people you say no
to.

08:40.500 --> 08:45.416
I am afraid
that you will go and I
will never see you again.

08:46.416 --> 08:52.125
I promise.
Whatever happens,
I'll come back to you.

Dr. Cornelius,
how is our patient?

09:45.708 --> 09:48.250
DR. CORNELIUS ON INTERCOM:
Could be better, Professor.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.750
He put up some resistance
when our boys picked him
up last night.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.875
Is he damaged?

09:51.875 --> 09:53.250
Nothing serious.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.625
Then begin
the adamantium feed.

09:56.708 --> 09:59.750
DR. CORNELIUS:
Feed initiated. Steady...

09:59.750 --> 10:03.250
Cardiotach
higher than expected.

10:07.958 --> 10:11.583

Cardiotach rising.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.208
Incredible!
The feed is impeded.

10:14.208 --> 10:15.458
He's resisting, sir.

10:15.458 --> 10:17.708
Adjust the feed accordingly!

10:20.958 --> 10:23.750
DR. CORNELIUS:
Adamantium feed
is compensating,

10:23.750 --> 10:25.833
but I've never seen
anything like this.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.958
PROFESSOR: It appears
we chose well, Cornelius.

10:28.958 --> 10:31.958
DR. CORNELIUS: Adamantium
reservoirs drained, sir.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.875
Absorption process complete.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.500
PROFESSOR:
And our dear Logan?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.083
DR. CORNELIUS:
Why not ask him yourself?

10:37.083 --> 10:38.708
A splendid idea.

10:38.708 --> 10:41.458
Logan, can you hear me?

10:43.333 --> 10:45.000
(GROWLING)

10:45.000 --> 10:47.583
I shall take that as a yes.

10:47.583 --> 10:50.583
Your skeleton has
been infused with

10:50.583 --> 10:53.500
a rare metal
called adamantium.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.833
Fascinating substance,
virtually indestructible.

(SHOUTING) Where
are you, Yuriko?

12:04.958 --> 12:07.458
(SOFTLY) Yuriko.
I told you I'd
come back.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.333
He's here.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.291
Attack.
But I want
him taken alive.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.375

12:27.375 --> 12:29.250
You're right, petite.
He need us.

12:31.583 --> 12:34.166
Bushwhacked.
Must be losing it.

(GROANS)

12:41.458 --> 12:43.000
(GRUNTING)

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000

12:51.000 --> 12:53.875
(SCOFFS) They're
a bunch of tin cans.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.583
Why don't you give
your circus a break?

13:09.583 --> 13:13.375
Your trap didn't work.
I'm alive.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.625
Now, where is Yuriko?

13:15.625 --> 13:19.375
Here, Logan, or
don't you recognize me?

13:19.375 --> 13:21.458
Yuriko?

13:21.458 --> 13:24.291
I knew you would
come back to me.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.083
You promised.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.708
What have you
done to yourself?

13:31.708 --> 13:35.458
Don't you
find me beautiful?

13:35.458 --> 13:38.291
I did it for you.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.125
Yuriko. No.

13:40.125 --> 13:43.500
The Yuriko you knew
no longer exists.

13:43.500 --> 13:48.708
I am Lady Deathstrike now,
a living weapon of revenge.

13:48.708 --> 13:49.750
(GRUNTS)

13:51.083 --> 13:53.500
Revenge? For what?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.166
For a murder.

13:55.166 --> 13:58.000
For the destruction
of my life.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.458
I searched for
years for a way

14:00.458 --> 14:03.333
to become
strong enough
to destroy you.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.125
The Reavers
offered me
an answer,

14:06.125 --> 14:09.291
become a cyborg
like they are.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.625
I was no longer
the Yuriko you knew.

14:13.625 --> 14:19.000
So I decided to change
my outer form to match
the darkness inside me.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.166
(WHOOSHING)

14:23.166 --> 14:28.166
I gave up
everything I had been
to become what I am now.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.000
Reborn to destroy.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.583
How could you do this?

14:43.583 --> 14:49.083
I had no choice
over what I became,
over what was done to me.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.625
I did it for
Professor Oyama.

14:51.625 --> 14:52.750
Oyama?

14:52.750 --> 14:54.458
The man who...

14:54.458 --> 14:58.625
The man who designed the
adamantium bonding process

14:58.625 --> 15:01.250
that made your
skeleton possible.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.583
So, what's that
got to do with you?

15:04.583 --> 15:09.208
He had a daughter
whose name was
Yuriko Oyama!

15:09.208 --> 15:10.458
My father!

15:10.458 --> 15:12.000
Your father?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.291
You destroyed him,
an innocent scientist,

15:15.291 --> 15:18.625
for what
his discovery
helped do to you.

15:18.625 --> 15:22.458
And now
I will destroy you.

15:22.458 --> 15:25.250
I don't want to
hurt you, Yuriko.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.833
The name is Deathstrike.

15:27.833 --> 15:28.875
(SCREAMS)

15:31.416 --> 15:32.583

15:38.875 --> 15:39.958
Get ready.

15:43.416 --> 15:45.500
I didn't kill him.

15:46.875 --> 15:47.958

15:50.583 --> 15:53.625
I loved you once.

15:54.708 --> 15:55.708

You should have finished me
when you had the chance,
Wolverine.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.416
I will not be so merciful.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.458
For my father!

16:13.458 --> 16:17.458
No, Deathstrike.
He was brought here
to open that alien ship.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.125
I don't care.
This is what
I want.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.500
(GUNS BEING COCKED)

16:21.500 --> 16:24.875
After we get
the alien technology,

16:24.875 --> 16:26.875
which ought to be worth
more than you're paying us,

16:27.875 --> 16:30.291
you can have your
revenge after that.

16:30.291 --> 16:31.500
Very well.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.500
After he's
opened the ship,

16:36.500 --> 16:41.166
I'll have
his adamantium skeleton
as a trophy on my wall.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.875
They've got Wolverine.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.291
Not yet, little one.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.583

16:45.583 --> 16:48.083
They are many. We are two.

the right moment.

(BOTH GASP)

17:22.166 --> 17:24.000
The Morlocks.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.708
It's just like
what those guys
did to Wolverine.

17:26.708 --> 17:28.500
Come, petite.
We help them later,

17:28.500 --> 17:29.708
if we can.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.000
Release him.

17:39.083 --> 17:40.375
(GROANS)

17:41.708 --> 17:43.500
(GROGGILY) What happened?

17:47.458 --> 17:50.208
Oh, yeah.
I remember.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.625
Now you'll do what I say!

17:52.625 --> 17:56.375
Open the alien spacecraft
with the claws my father
made for you!

17:56.375 --> 17:57.875
Open it yourself.

17:57.875 --> 18:01.291
Your end can
be quick and easy

18:01.291 --> 18:04.291
or slow and painful.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.416
It's your choice.

18:06.416 --> 18:08.291
(SCREAMING)

18:08.291 --> 18:09.875
Destroy him!

18:11.375 --> 18:15.708
Sorry, lady.
I don't kill easy.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.333
Now, petite.

18:32.458 --> 18:33.875
(SCREAMS)

18:35.458 --> 18:36.875
Get them.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.208
Hey!
Don't take it personally.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.500
(GRUNTING)

19:00.166 --> 19:01.375
(EXCLAIMS)

19:05.875 --> 19:08.875
(DEATHSTRIKE
GRUNTING VICIOUSLY)

19:28.000 --> 19:29.708
(SCREAMING)

19:30.708 --> 19:31.875
Gambit!

19:31.875 --> 19:33.625
Hey! Let me go!

19:33.625 --> 19:36.166
Keep your computer
hands to yourself.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.250
It doesn't have to
end this way, Yuriko.

19:43.250 --> 19:47.166
Yuriko is gone.
There is only Deathstrike!

19:51.500 --> 19:53.333
(SCREAMING)

19:54.250 --> 19:56.500
(GROANING)

19:56.500 --> 19:58.375
(SCREAMING)

20:00.458 --> 20:01.875
I understand.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.458
A force field.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.000
(BEEPING)

20:05.000 --> 20:06.583
It's a warning.
Don't open the ship!

20:06.583 --> 20:09.875
Yuriko. Pull away!

20:09.875 --> 20:13.625
(SOBBING)

20:14.625 --> 20:16.708
Let her go!

20:20.500 --> 20:24.708
(WHOOSHING)

20:31.166 --> 20:33.250
What is it,
Wolverine?

20:33.250 --> 20:34.875
What's happening?

20:34.875 --> 20:37.166
I don't think
I want to know.
