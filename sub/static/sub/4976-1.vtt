00:29.599 --> 00:31.888
My name is David Kruipen.

00:33.966 --> 00:36.093
"What is sacrifice?

00:37.061 --> 00:40.795
What does it mean
to make a real difference?

00:41.585 --> 00:45.381
Throughout my life and career,
I have straddled two worlds.

00:46.076 --> 00:48.240
Increasingly I have become...

00:48.393 --> 00:50.061
...respected.

00:50.219 --> 00:51.443
Increasingly...

00:51.733 --> 00:55.030
... my books and articles
are published and read.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.209
Increasingly I have been
embraced by policymakers...

00:59.262 --> 01:00.709
...and referenced by bureaucrats...

01:00.734 --> 01:02.975
...but today I realized...

01:03.288 --> 01:04.849
...that I have...

01:05.491 --> 01:07.553
...misguided myself.

01:09.311 --> 01:11.764
Today I rediscovered...

01:12.998 --> 01:15.967
...what I knew
when I was young. "

01:22.627 --> 01:24.837
- Is that one on her forehead?
- I can't look.

01:24.926 --> 01:26.970
Jesus Christ!

01:28.256 --> 01:29.506
I know.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.834
You said it was a tick.

01:30.859 --> 01:33.459
- Um, I don't know if it was a tick.
- It's not a tick.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.053
- I don't know.
- It hurts.

01:35.078 --> 01:37.998
I know, sweetheart,
but I need you to stay still.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.684
Okay, it's just about there.
Hold on, hold on.

01:41.787 --> 01:43.928
Hold on.
Okay okay.

01:44.248 --> 01:45.865
Okay, there, Doug,
do you see that?

01:45.890 --> 01:47.201
- Jesus.
- What?

01:47.226 --> 01:48.944
- See those hairs?
- Get the tweezers, the tweezers.

01:48.969 --> 01:51.305
I want you to grab it. Honey,
keep your head still, please.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.389
- Get back in so I can see it.
- What?

01:53.414 --> 01:54.600
Get... Just...

01:56.936 --> 01:58.115
Shit.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.998
What do I do?
What do I do?

02:00.023 --> 02:01.865
We have to do something
about the population.

02:01.890 --> 02:04.434
- And what is wrong with the population?
- We have too many people.

02:04.663 --> 02:07.291
There's way too many people
using way too much stuff.

02:07.316 --> 02:08.967
That's why we have
global warming.

02:09.068 --> 02:11.170
They will tell you
that we are on the verge...

02:11.195 --> 02:14.615
...of imminent destruction.
The carbon dioxide in the air...

02:14.640 --> 02:17.477
...is gonna turn our atmosphere
into a microwave...

02:17.578 --> 02:19.372
...and we're all gonna burn and die.

02:20.803 --> 02:22.522
What a load of crap.

02:24.301 --> 02:25.459
I don't care what they say.

02:25.484 --> 02:27.897
It's not a glacial meltdown
or anything like that.

02:28.039 --> 02:29.694
For decades
we've been warned.

02:29.719 --> 02:32.805
Global warming is definitely real
and it's potentially catastrophic.

02:33.540 --> 02:35.458
I believe it's prophecy
being fulfilled...

02:35.483 --> 02:38.111
...hard times that's spoken
about in the Bible.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.498
Global warming is
becoming a religion...

02:40.523 --> 02:42.420
...for some of these...
for some of these loonies.

02:42.603 --> 02:46.576
Of course there's global warming
and of course it's man-made.

02:46.821 --> 02:48.781
It's a hoax.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.710
The melting Arctic will
reveal a frightening truth.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.936
I don't think that people are
going to do enough in time.

02:55.501 --> 02:58.569
We're on the brink of Armageddon.
Most of us will die.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.561
The few of us who survive will be...

03:00.586 --> 03:02.630
...living in a world like Somalia.

03:04.131 --> 03:05.811
And what can we do about it?

03:06.108 --> 03:08.998
We make small sacrifices,
but the real ones that really matter...

03:09.023 --> 03:11.442
- The world will change, I don't think.
- Ever.

03:11.815 --> 03:14.725
What does it mean to make
a real difference?

03:14.750 --> 03:18.337
...radical environmentalists and
clearly a legitimate terrorist threat.

03:18.905 --> 03:21.217
When non-violent
methods fail to...

03:21.242 --> 03:23.411
...change people's minds
quickly enough...

03:23.552 --> 03:25.451
...well, we have to consider
other options.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.498
- The time is now.
- We have a breaking story.

03:28.690 --> 03:31.569
It's spreading quickly
and hospitals cannot keep up.

03:31.633 --> 03:34.670
Thousands are violently ill,
hundreds dead.

03:34.728 --> 03:36.834
There is complete chaos
in the streets.

03:36.859 --> 03:40.738
400 people have died.
At least 10,000 are infected.

03:40.961 --> 03:44.381
State troopers and the National Guard
were ordered to seal off all borders...

03:44.602 --> 03:47.162
...as people
are trying to flee.

03:49.164 --> 03:52.295
When nature is the terrorist...

03:59.252 --> 04:01.444
We're gonna... we're gonna die.

04:01.956 --> 04:03.358
It's too late to do anything.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.944
Die, I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die!

04:06.815 --> 04:08.859
I'm gonna... Help me!

04:08.939 --> 04:09.877
One...

04:11.115 --> 04:12.545
of the horrors...

04:12.602 --> 04:15.605
The worst bio terrorism
we've ever known.

04:15.967 --> 04:17.303
Oh my God!

04:20.357 --> 04:21.841
I'm dead!

05:35.289 --> 05:37.875
David!

06:16.106 --> 06:18.692
A couple hundred pounds
underweight.

06:18.827 --> 06:20.421
He must have traveled far.

06:20.499 --> 06:22.664
The teeth... only two years old.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.346
He probably tried to swim...

06:28.945 --> 06:30.796
...off island, had to come back.

06:30.936 --> 06:32.609
Not enough ice.

06:39.645 --> 06:41.179
What's he saying?

06:41.455 --> 06:43.836
He's saying get
the fuck over here.

06:45.512 --> 06:47.429
What did you find, man?

06:50.529 --> 06:51.711
What is it?

06:54.020 --> 06:55.343
Manalu.

07:05.368 --> 07:07.296
The pine beetle is
just one example...

07:07.321 --> 07:11.241
...of the profound impact
global warming is having on the planet.

07:11.802 --> 07:14.398
The truth is our way of life
is leaving the door open...

07:14.423 --> 07:16.383
...to an infinite number
of threats...

07:16.408 --> 07:19.445
...equally as pernicious
as the tiny pine beetle.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.492
We're not going to see an end
to this sort of horror...

07:23.822 --> 07:25.617
...unless sacrifices are made.

07:26.824 --> 07:28.836
And that's all for now.

07:29.145 --> 07:31.976
Now as you know, a few
of you will have the honor...

07:32.001 --> 07:34.337
...of joining the renown
Dr. Kruipen and his team...

07:34.611 --> 07:36.890
...studying the impact
of global warming...

07:36.915 --> 07:38.542
...on polar bears.

07:39.185 --> 07:40.492
Atom Galen...

07:41.551 --> 07:43.086
Federico Fulce...

07:43.782 --> 07:45.140
...and Ling Chen.

07:51.126 --> 07:54.587
- Yes, Atom?
- I thought four students were going.

07:55.128 --> 07:59.148
So did I. Unfortunately
that is no longer the case.

08:03.497 --> 08:05.708
Jesus Christ!

08:06.202 --> 08:08.121
You know, we probably would
have been there by now...

08:08.146 --> 08:11.843
...if you guys didn't have to, like,
put on four different bathing suits.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.343
I asked you
to please not call me.

08:18.741 --> 08:21.187
Evelyn, don't hang up.
It's important.

08:21.881 --> 08:24.546
We discovered something.
I want you to come up.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.273
I told you I'm not ready
to see you.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.258
Can we please
just leave it at that?

08:28.705 --> 08:30.148
Ev, I just...

08:30.988 --> 08:32.734
I want you to understand.

08:33.506 --> 08:35.789
You want me to understand?

08:36.123 --> 08:38.554
Dad, you couldn't even
make it to her funeral.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.842
Evelyn, this is important.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.600
It's important to our cause.

08:46.497 --> 08:48.953
Look, Dad, it's not my cause.

08:49.264 --> 08:51.375
It's your cause.
You're the one who chose...

08:51.400 --> 08:54.718
Okay, so apparently people just get out
of vehicles when they're moving.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.406
Everybody knows about global warming.
Congratulations.

08:57.707 --> 09:00.001
It just really too bad
nobody really gives a shit.

09:00.870 --> 09:01.712
Ev,

09:02.617 --> 09:03.375
I'll...

09:03.842 --> 09:06.117
...give you all
of your mother's money.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.281
- No more monthly payments?
- That's right.

09:12.474 --> 09:14.937
There are some students
coming up from Dawson...

09:15.182 --> 09:16.890
I'll save you a seat.

09:17.882 --> 09:18.601
Hey,

09:19.250 --> 09:20.921
Evy, get in the car!

09:23.285 --> 09:25.117
Uh, I'll... I don't know.
I'll think about it.

09:25.142 --> 09:27.523
- Get in the car!
- Dad, look, I have to go.

09:28.313 --> 09:30.679
I'll think about it.
Could you hold on a minute?

09:30.704 --> 09:33.179
- We're moving.
- Calm down.

09:36.681 --> 09:38.031
How can I communicate
with the world...

09:38.056 --> 09:40.225
...when I can't even communicate
with my own daughter?

09:40.808 --> 09:43.484
She's just angry right now.
She'll come around.

09:47.982 --> 09:49.390
What?

10:24.484 --> 10:26.570
Eight hours from bottle
to throttle, buddy.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.250
Are you good?

10:30.889 --> 10:32.062
Yeah, I'm good.

10:33.275 --> 10:35.125
Someone named Ling called.

10:35.329 --> 10:37.915
- Said she was running late.
- Thanks.

10:37.979 --> 10:39.187
Sounded cute.

10:47.325 --> 10:48.406
Hello?

10:48.772 --> 10:50.774
Bart, I need your help.

10:52.007 --> 10:53.187
Dr. Kruipen?

10:53.438 --> 10:55.899
I can't reach Evy.
She can't come up.

10:56.855 --> 10:59.039
Why?
Is everything okay?

10:59.064 --> 11:00.211
Yes, everything's fine.

11:00.236 --> 11:02.992
Just make sure she
doesn't come up.

11:04.608 --> 11:08.654
- Okay.
- I'll send her paperwork back with you.

11:09.836 --> 11:10.851
Sure.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.336
Listen...

11:45.112 --> 11:46.748
Did you reach Bart?

11:48.109 --> 11:50.320
David, did you
tell them not to come?

11:50.603 --> 11:52.438
To call for help?

11:52.762 --> 11:55.552
- Yes, I did.
- Thank God.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.404
Nuti is...

12:02.527 --> 12:04.185
...he's much worse.

12:05.737 --> 12:07.006
And I'm...

12:10.009 --> 12:11.810
I'm not much better.

12:34.355 --> 12:36.295
- Hey, nice chopper.
- Thanks.

12:36.341 --> 12:38.343
- Where are you from?
- Dawson City.

12:39.033 --> 12:42.021
- Where are you from originally?
- Dawson City.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.943
One of you gentlemen want
to help her with her bags there?

12:50.402 --> 12:52.841
Yeah. Here, let me
take that for you.

12:52.982 --> 12:54.271
No thanks.

12:56.571 --> 12:58.615
- Oh, hey, let me get that.
- Oh, thank you.

12:58.774 --> 12:59.802
Thanks.

13:00.098 --> 13:01.779
- Can I ride in the front?
- Yeah.

13:01.845 --> 13:03.263
There you go.
Hop in.

13:03.414 --> 13:04.279
Thanks.

13:08.182 --> 13:09.373
Oh, shoot.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.459
Uh, just put your stuff
in the back there, guys.

13:20.116 --> 13:21.756
- Evy.
- Hey, Bart.

13:22.266 --> 13:23.107
Well...

13:24.003 --> 13:24.974
shoot.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.756
You weren't supposed
to come up.

13:27.216 --> 13:29.115
- What?
- That's what he said.

13:29.148 --> 13:31.441
I was supposed to give you some
sort of paperwork when I got back.

13:31.554 --> 13:33.810
So he doesn't even
want me to come up there?

13:34.455 --> 13:36.263
I'm sure he's got his reasons.

13:39.255 --> 13:41.882
You know what? I don't really
care what he says. I'm coming.

13:42.057 --> 13:44.142
Uh... Uh... Evy?

13:44.395 --> 13:45.451
Listen...

13:46.493 --> 13:48.996
...that's going to put me
in a really tight spot, see 'cause...

13:49.021 --> 13:50.209
- Sorry, Bart.

13:51.532 --> 13:54.631
Yeah, you see, I kinda...
I promised him...

13:56.672 --> 13:57.545
Okay.

14:10.648 --> 14:13.776
Ground Control, this is Major Tom.
We're outta here, man.

14:14.435 --> 14:17.013
This is Ground Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.

14:38.580 --> 14:40.958
Did I hear that you're
David Kruipen's daughter?

14:41.014 --> 14:41.887
Yeah.

14:43.196 --> 14:46.408
No way. That...
it must be so cool.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.918
Yeah, he's my hero.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.848
Is it true that
when he was younger...

14:51.873 --> 14:54.527
...he sabotaged a pipeline that was
blocking Migratory Caribou?

14:54.933 --> 14:56.265
I guess so, yeah.

14:56.535 --> 14:59.887
Huh, sure has changed.

15:14.649 --> 15:17.965
It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.762
I'll wrap him in plastic...

15:34.312 --> 15:35.598
...just in case.

15:36.666 --> 15:38.199
Make sure it's sealed.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.582
We need to protect ourselves...

15:40.851 --> 15:42.379
...until we're ready.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.207
Are you okay?

16:02.820 --> 16:03.715
No.

16:07.708 --> 16:09.332
Ready for what?

16:11.149 --> 16:13.941
Edward, ready for what?

16:33.801 --> 16:35.582
Look at that ice.

16:38.234 --> 16:40.903
Yeah, she's breaking up
more and more every year.

16:41.327 --> 16:44.580
It's terrible.
When are we gonna wake up?

16:44.873 --> 16:48.973
It's not that easy, buddy, not when
people's lifestyles are at stake.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.620
What are you
implying, Federico?

16:53.177 --> 16:56.433
I'm just saying that we can't ignore
the reality of what we're up against.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.683
Somebody's got
to take responsibility.

16:59.113 --> 17:01.965
Okay, sure, but what are we
really doing to stop it?

17:02.179 --> 17:03.660
I mean really stop it?

17:04.286 --> 17:07.657
Look at Kruipen. He's attacking
the problem from the inside out...

17:07.695 --> 17:08.776
changing how people think.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.917
What if we don't have
that much time, anyway?

17:11.229 --> 17:13.902
Maybe the best way to change
how people think is to...

17:14.962 --> 17:16.494
...blow something up,
you know?

17:16.974 --> 17:19.667
Look at that ice down there.
That's melting fast.

17:20.579 --> 17:21.839
What do you think?

17:23.765 --> 17:26.675
Oh... You don't want to know
what I think.

17:27.796 --> 17:28.933
Sure we do.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.676
Honestly,

17:33.246 --> 17:34.941
I think that people are
incapable of change...

17:34.966 --> 17:36.339
...and our days are numbered.

17:36.669 --> 17:39.027
Might as well enjoy the
place while we can.

17:39.790 --> 17:42.941
See? That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

17:43.734 --> 17:46.254
Nobody's willing to make
any sacrifices.

17:50.856 --> 17:52.285
Thar she blows.

18:28.116 --> 18:29.519
There's no power.

18:30.439 --> 18:32.574
What is that smell?

18:33.835 --> 18:35.769
Smells like something
died in here.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.136
Mmm, ahem!

18:44.544 --> 18:45.478
Hello!

18:46.690 --> 18:48.859
Dr. Kruipen?
Edward?

18:49.315 --> 18:51.009
Why is there no heat?

18:51.591 --> 18:53.718
Yeah, wouldn't the pipes
freeze at night?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.642
They must be
out in the field.

18:56.432 --> 18:59.275
There's no running water either.

19:00.323 --> 19:01.931
The Genny must be off.

19:02.456 --> 19:04.251
I'm gonna go check it out,
okay? All right.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.736
Hey, where you going?

19:12.983 --> 19:15.228
The restroom.
Is that okay with you?

19:18.321 --> 19:20.375
Well, now we know why
one of us got bumped.

19:20.495 --> 19:22.986
Yeah, and she doesn't even
sound like she wants to be here.

19:55.514 --> 19:56.665
Shoot.

20:03.163 --> 20:04.665
Did you want a water?

20:05.282 --> 20:06.560
No thanks.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.748
I'm gonna go look around.

20:19.504 --> 20:20.560
Ling...

20:21.446 --> 20:24.302
...look, I know I can never
expect you to trust me again.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.482
I made a huge mistake.

20:32.196 --> 20:35.125
You are so full of shit.

20:35.891 --> 20:37.809
What, a little makeup sex
in the Arctic?

20:37.834 --> 20:39.507
Something to tell
your buddies about?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.710
- You know it's not like that.
- Oh, really?

20:41.750 --> 20:42.656
Well, then...

20:43.697 --> 20:45.351
why tell me this now?

20:45.378 --> 20:46.562
I don't know.

20:47.301 --> 20:48.984
You were so angry.

20:50.740 --> 20:52.203
And I was scared.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.719
Evelyn?

22:10.811 --> 22:13.384
I'm looking for something
that belongs to me.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.197
You don't really believe what
you said in the helicopter, do you?

22:18.907 --> 22:20.290
What did I say?

22:21.072 --> 22:22.876
About just giving up.

22:24.037 --> 22:25.908
Bet your dad
doesn't think that.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.626
You'd probably know what
he thinks better than I do.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.673
My dad's in the oil business.

22:40.329 --> 22:43.017
A few years ago,
one of his rigs hit sour gas...

22:43.042 --> 22:44.423
...and the well blew out.

22:45.079 --> 22:47.165
The gas blew downwind
and killed nine people.

22:48.551 --> 22:51.290
I asked him how he could live
with himself and you know what he said?

22:53.929 --> 22:55.525
"Plenty more
where they came from. "

22:55.956 --> 22:58.025
Just part of the risk.

23:04.587 --> 23:06.908
So now you know why
I'm willing to blow shit up.

23:08.253 --> 23:11.340
You don't really think that
eco terrorism is the answer.

23:12.069 --> 23:13.306
I don't know.

23:15.536 --> 23:19.165
But I want to do what needs to be done,
be there when the ball starts rolling.

23:25.951 --> 23:29.376
There's a flashlight in the lab. We'll
need it if the Genny doesn't start.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.414
Ewww.

24:02.305 --> 24:03.969
- Man.
- Ugh.

24:06.204 --> 24:08.219
Oh, that is brutal.

24:10.931 --> 24:12.899
God, it stinks.

24:13.736 --> 24:15.563
What the hell is that?

24:17.028 --> 24:18.204
I don't know.

24:19.181 --> 24:21.430
Hold on.
Don't get so close.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.133
Oh my God!
Oh, shit, are you okay?

24:27.419 --> 24:28.766
Yeah, it's okay.

24:37.861 --> 24:38.836
Hello?

24:38.989 --> 24:40.641
Yeah, we're in here.

24:46.202 --> 24:48.039
Oh, Jeez Louise!

24:49.038 --> 24:51.063
Not exactly my choice
of words, but...

24:51.417 --> 24:52.918
...yeah.

24:53.906 --> 24:56.047
Why do they have this
rotting bear in here?

24:56.680 --> 24:58.961
- Oh.
- I don't know, but I need a picture, man.

25:06.826 --> 25:07.717
Ow!

25:08.805 --> 25:10.415
Something just bit me.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.164
What?

25:16.155 --> 25:17.180
Ow.

25:18.312 --> 25:20.954
I think it's just a flea bite.
You're gonna make it.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.133
Let's get out of here.
The stink is getting to me.

25:27.633 --> 25:29.430
Evelyn, hold up.

25:34.131 --> 25:35.844
I heard a gunshot.

25:36.128 --> 25:36.993
What?

25:37.766 --> 25:40.685
From out in the field
when I was filling up the Genny.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.188
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.

25:43.852 --> 25:45.657
I just thought
you should know.

25:47.029 --> 25:49.063
- Okay?
- Okay.

26:14.148 --> 26:16.322
My name is David Kruipen.

26:18.483 --> 26:20.384
"What is sacrifice?"

26:39.455 --> 26:42.353
Base station
to field station, come in.

26:46.497 --> 26:48.509
Base station to field station.

26:50.236 --> 26:51.283
Dad?

26:52.078 --> 26:53.790
Dad, are you out there?

26:59.349 --> 27:00.830
Evelyn?

27:04.026 --> 27:05.876
Jane, could you please
put my dad on?

27:07.518 --> 27:10.361
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

27:12.013 --> 27:15.033
I don't want to discuss this with you.
Could you please put my dad on?

27:15.766 --> 27:18.712
Evelyn, are the students
with you?

27:19.755 --> 27:21.908
Yes, of course they're here.
Why wouldn't they be?

27:26.525 --> 27:28.775
Jane, could you please
put my father on?

27:32.055 --> 27:33.103
David!

27:34.608 --> 27:37.751
They're here!
The students are here.

27:38.674 --> 27:41.259
David, Evelyn's here.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.345
She's on the radio.

27:44.302 --> 27:46.322
She's at the base station.

27:46.772 --> 27:48.423
What's going on, David?

27:49.321 --> 27:51.462
Evelyn, what are you
doing here?

27:53.153 --> 27:55.759
- So now you don't even want to see me?
- I do.

27:56.205 --> 27:59.611
It's just... it's very important
that you stay where you are.

27:59.718 --> 28:01.494
Where are you?
Everybody's waiting.

28:01.615 --> 28:04.535
Please do what I'm saying,
just this once.

28:05.170 --> 28:08.970
- What's going on?
- Just do what I'm asking this one time.

28:09.214 --> 28:10.064
Okay?

28:11.103 --> 28:12.025
Please?

28:14.841 --> 28:17.129
Okay. Fine.

28:18.785 --> 28:19.629
Good.

28:21.095 --> 28:22.465
Why are they here?

28:24.182 --> 28:27.043
- I don't know.
- What did you do?

28:29.573 --> 28:30.895
You should lay down.

28:32.219 --> 28:33.403
I'll be there in a minute.

28:47.773 --> 28:50.187
The students are here.
Evelyn too.

28:53.227 --> 28:54.624
What did you tell Jane?

28:55.041 --> 28:57.109
Nothing.
I don't think she's...

28:57.776 --> 28:59.601
...got the strength
to go through with it.

29:02.658 --> 29:05.744
- I'll take care of it.
- I know.

29:05.943 --> 29:08.406
- We're doing the right thing.
- I know.

29:22.489 --> 29:23.281
Jane?

29:31.956 --> 29:33.492
Edward, no!

29:48.998 --> 29:50.195
Any luck?

29:50.662 --> 29:53.040
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, they're on their way.

29:53.401 --> 29:54.335
Good.

29:58.277 --> 29:59.626
Everything okay?

30:01.757 --> 30:02.755
I don't know.

30:03.619 --> 30:05.697
Why did he tell you
not to bring me?

30:07.780 --> 30:08.962
He didn't say.

30:09.520 --> 30:11.244
God, he's such an asshole.

30:16.787 --> 30:18.815
It tears him up, Evy.

30:19.254 --> 30:20.369
It really does.

30:20.757 --> 30:23.478
Look, I know you're probably
still mad about the funeral.

30:24.438 --> 30:27.065
But he did everything
he could to get there.

30:27.819 --> 30:31.744
- I mean, we were snowed in.
- Yeah, I know.

31:15.546 --> 31:16.650
You hear that?

31:17.428 --> 31:18.962
Yeah, what is that?

31:29.409 --> 31:30.806
It sounds like...

31:31.817 --> 31:33.861
...homo Sapiens mating.

32:01.097 --> 32:02.408
I missed you so much.

32:03.587 --> 32:05.080
I know you did.

32:06.933 --> 32:07.869
A bug!

32:07.926 --> 32:08.798
Jesus.

32:09.181 --> 32:10.478
- What?
- It's a bug.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.970
- It's just a bug.
- You don't understand.

32:17.521 --> 32:20.001
It's something I've had since
I was a kid. It's a phobia, okay?

32:20.026 --> 32:21.056
It's... it's a...

32:21.946 --> 32:23.416
I can't handle it.

32:25.483 --> 32:27.318
You never told me that.

32:29.079 --> 32:30.955
It's not exactly
something I'm proud of.

32:31.023 --> 32:32.692
All right?
Now come on, let's go.

32:33.686 --> 32:36.251
Where are you going?
I'm not going to go sleep out there.

32:37.441 --> 32:40.068
Okay, come on, you don't understand.
I can't stay here.

32:40.462 --> 32:43.001
- Please come with me.
- It's okay, Feddy.

32:43.457 --> 32:46.168
- I'll look after you.
- I can't stay here.

32:46.521 --> 32:48.142
Okay? I'll be
in the other room.

33:40.758 --> 33:42.001
What are you doing?

33:42.149 --> 33:43.727
Somebody's here.

33:45.534 --> 33:46.446
Bart!

33:48.762 --> 33:50.560
You guys!

33:51.593 --> 33:52.641
God.

33:53.125 --> 33:54.977
I feel like ass.

33:57.017 --> 33:58.415
Dude, your arm is bleeding.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.422
Jeez Louise,
this ain't no flea bite.

34:06.972 --> 34:08.735
- Ow!
- Stop scratching it.

34:10.197 --> 34:11.735
It's flipping itchy, man.

34:12.679 --> 34:13.563
Hello?

34:18.875 --> 34:19.735
Dad?

34:28.452 --> 34:29.429
Hello?

35:00.941 --> 35:02.986
Jane? Oh my God.

35:03.607 --> 35:06.189
Help!
Somebody help!

35:10.722 --> 35:11.807
What was that?

35:13.413 --> 35:14.564
What's going on?

35:20.956 --> 35:22.088
Ling?

35:27.308 --> 35:28.799
No no, Ling...

35:29.568 --> 35:31.049
Ling, honey, it's okay.

35:35.363 --> 35:36.908
Ling, you'll be fine, baby.

35:38.499 --> 35:41.033
- Who the hell is this?
- My dad's assistant.

35:41.058 --> 35:43.057
Evelyn found her
in the helicopter.

35:43.601 --> 35:44.861
Jesus Christ.

35:58.222 --> 35:59.861
I... I thought
there was a bug.

36:00.443 --> 36:02.088
- Uh-huh.
- It was just my zipper.

36:02.113 --> 36:03.010
Yeah.

36:05.976 --> 36:08.002
- I'm gonna try my dad again.
- Okay.

36:09.675 --> 36:10.955
Oh, uh...

36:12.649 --> 36:13.689
...sorry.

36:16.673 --> 36:18.861
Base station
to field station, come in.

36:20.789 --> 36:23.025
Base station to
field station, come in.

36:25.278 --> 36:26.807
Dad, it's me.
Come in.

36:29.707 --> 36:31.205
Dad, are you there?

36:59.811 --> 37:03.272
Ahem.
Is she contagious?

37:03.946 --> 37:04.984
I don't know.

37:05.253 --> 37:07.005
She's burning up.
Might be pneumonia.

37:07.687 --> 37:09.586
We gotta get her out of here.
She needs medical attention.

37:09.611 --> 37:11.484
That's the best idea
I've heard in a long time.

37:11.677 --> 37:14.195
This place is infested with bugs.
Ling's got bites all over her face.

37:14.235 --> 37:16.827
We gotta get out of here.
I got this... medical condition.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.206
it's a medical condition.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.000
It's a phobia.
It's like a panic attack!

37:24.025 --> 37:25.203
All right, all right.

37:25.688 --> 37:27.836
As soon as light breaks,
we'll fly out to Sachs Harbour.

37:29.667 --> 37:32.179
What about my dad?
Nobody's answering at the field station.

37:32.228 --> 37:34.140
Something's obviously
happened out there... something bad.

37:34.165 --> 37:36.008
We don't even know where
"out there" is, do we?

37:43.559 --> 37:44.383
What?

37:46.325 --> 37:48.875
Look, the ATV she came
in on has a GPS unit.

37:49.232 --> 37:51.578
We'll get the coordinates for
the field station. We'll fly out there...

37:51.603 --> 37:52.953
...and we'll see what's going on.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.797
If there's an emergency,
we'll call for a second chopper.

37:57.333 --> 37:58.890
Okay, sounds reasonable.

38:00.013 --> 38:01.140
Guys, I'm sorry.

38:01.424 --> 38:03.922
It's all right. Let's load everything
into the helicopter.

38:03.995 --> 38:05.705
We'll come back
and we'll get Jane.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.500
- Thank you.
- Okay.

38:09.533 --> 38:11.195
Where did you get
my dad's camera?

38:13.210 --> 38:14.648
It was in Jane's jacket.

38:18.875 --> 38:20.578
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

38:24.019 --> 38:25.133
There's no tape.

38:30.263 --> 38:32.375
Okay, guys, come on,
let's get packing. Let's go.

38:36.287 --> 38:37.383
Are you okay?

38:38.763 --> 38:39.601
Yeah.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.719
- What time is it?
- About 3:00 a. M.

38:57.205 --> 38:58.008
Jesus.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.977
Holy shit.

39:12.313 --> 39:13.313
What is it?

39:16.296 --> 39:17.578
Oh, man.

39:21.358 --> 39:24.235
- What?
- Take a look.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.086
Jesus H Christ.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.212
- What the heck was she thinking?
- That's a really good question.

39:32.605 --> 39:33.359
What?

39:34.084 --> 39:36.295
- Sabotage.
- Jane.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.750
It'll take me a couple
hours to fix this.

39:39.826 --> 39:42.149
You gotta be kidding me?
Can't we call another helicopter?

39:43.507 --> 39:45.234
It won't take me that long.

39:46.710 --> 39:48.258
Oh, whoa whoa.
What's that for?

39:48.375 --> 39:49.774
Relax, it's just a precaution.

39:50.439 --> 39:52.107
- I have to go.
- Evy!

39:52.165 --> 39:54.031
- Where are you going?
- The field station.

39:54.081 --> 39:55.211
I don't think
that's a good idea.

39:55.236 --> 39:57.453
No kidding. What if this thing's
fixed and you're not back?

39:57.563 --> 39:58.375
Evy.

39:58.992 --> 40:00.438
Honestly, what do we do?

40:00.463 --> 40:04.438
Hey, that woman's really sick.
I don't think she can breathe.

40:08.262 --> 40:09.180
Come on.

40:12.565 --> 40:15.235
Oh my God,
oh my God.

40:15.924 --> 40:16.758
Oh, Jane!

40:17.500 --> 40:19.281
Jane, it's me. It's Evelyn.

40:20.378 --> 40:21.156
Oh no.

40:21.181 --> 40:23.934
We have to do something.
It's okay.

40:25.459 --> 40:26.813
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

40:26.838 --> 40:29.297
Sorry for what?
It's okay.

40:32.685 --> 40:34.624
Don't let them leave.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.110
Let who leave?

40:36.901 --> 40:37.625
No.

40:39.982 --> 40:40.766
Holy shit.

40:40.791 --> 40:43.164
- She can't breathe!
- What can I do? Tell me what to do!

40:43.435 --> 40:45.836
No, stay with me, please.
Please!

40:46.896 --> 40:48.641
Jane, stay with me.
It's okay.

40:50.293 --> 40:52.879
No no.

40:55.405 --> 40:57.602
- No!
- No no no no! I wouldn't do that, no.

41:13.710 --> 41:15.709
Better seal off the room.
Who knows what she's got?

41:17.641 --> 41:19.490
Yeah, it's a good call.

41:23.315 --> 41:24.650
There... there's

41:24.740 --> 41:26.888
some plastic around
back by the Genny.

41:28.246 --> 41:29.068
Yeah.

41:35.078 --> 41:36.427
Come on, everybody out.

41:40.995 --> 41:41.795
Now.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.787
Just give me a minute.
I knew her!

41:54.615 --> 41:55.646
Evy.

41:58.889 --> 42:00.091
Oh, God damn it.

42:15.885 --> 42:18.513
Where the hell is she going?
I thought we agreed to stick together?

42:18.538 --> 42:19.321
Atom!

42:23.995 --> 42:25.500
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

42:26.408 --> 42:28.578
That woman just died in there, man.
Think about it.

42:29.985 --> 42:31.547
That's her dad out there, man.

42:38.597 --> 42:40.899
As soon as that helicopter gets fixed,
we're getting out of here.

42:44.317 --> 42:46.024
Get the duct tape.
Let's seal up this door.

42:54.367 --> 42:55.493
Evelyn!

42:56.349 --> 42:58.914
- Wait for me.
- What are you doing?

43:02.454 --> 43:03.766
I'm coming with you.

44:14.289 --> 44:15.344
Why'd you stop?

44:37.391 --> 44:38.652
Shoot.

44:44.532 --> 44:45.628
Shoot.

44:52.958 --> 44:55.627
- How is it going?
- It's worse than I thought.

44:55.966 --> 44:57.824
Why didn't you say something?
We should be calling for help.

44:57.849 --> 45:01.097
- I'm doing everything I can, okay?
- This is so fucked.

45:11.779 --> 45:12.860
Dad?

45:20.597 --> 45:21.512
Dad?

45:24.617 --> 45:27.113
Holy crap.

45:32.216 --> 45:33.941
Is that a wooly mammoth?

45:34.915 --> 45:36.426
Jesus, it's pristine.

45:39.760 --> 45:40.785
What is it?

45:42.604 --> 45:44.691
It looks like eggs of some kind.

45:46.945 --> 45:49.066
Yeah, it looks like they're
thawing with the mammoth.

45:51.027 --> 45:53.029
Oh my God,
did you see that?

45:54.524 --> 45:55.777
That's impossible.

45:58.735 --> 46:01.070
Isn't there that
species of frog?

46:01.941 --> 46:03.168
Yeah, the-the... Um...

46:03.348 --> 46:06.277
...the wood frog... its liver glycogen
converts to glucose...

46:06.841 --> 46:07.917
...but, that happens over a winter.

46:07.942 --> 46:10.097
This thing's gotta be what?
20,000 years old?

46:11.291 --> 46:12.370
Yeah.

46:17.986 --> 46:18.886
Dad?

46:25.004 --> 46:26.456
Oh... oh my God.

46:26.564 --> 46:28.753
- Who is that?
- It's Edward.

46:28.925 --> 46:30.112
He works for my dad.

46:31.168 --> 46:32.292
Dad!

46:51.234 --> 46:53.445
No no no.

46:54.167 --> 46:56.198
- No no no...
- Evelyn.

46:57.320 --> 46:58.905
No, God, no!

46:59.022 --> 47:00.982
- Don't don't, Evelyn!
- No, please.

47:01.024 --> 47:03.401
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to see him like this.

47:03.443 --> 47:05.721
- No no!
- Don't remember him like this.

47:06.947 --> 47:08.667
It's okay.

47:11.659 --> 47:14.050
What am I supposed
to do now?

47:16.591 --> 47:18.343
It's not fair!

47:18.446 --> 47:20.909
He's gone and I still hate him.

47:32.555 --> 47:35.350
Ow, ohh.

47:37.393 --> 47:39.443
Oh, Jesus Christ.

47:58.081 --> 48:00.396
I just had the most
painful piss of my life.

48:00.690 --> 48:04.201
- Any idea why?
- What are you saying?

48:04.349 --> 48:06.032
- Oh, little Miss Innocent?

48:08.087 --> 48:11.313
Who have you been seeing
for the past couple months?

48:17.707 --> 48:19.540
Jesus, baby, I'm sorry.

48:23.006 --> 48:24.212
I just...

48:26.226 --> 48:28.908
Oh, I guess I'm just...

48:29.450 --> 48:31.790
I'm scared, okay?

48:36.677 --> 48:38.533
There's something
wrong with us.

48:39.064 --> 48:40.064
Yeah

48:40.756 --> 48:42.423
Some kind of infection.

48:50.169 --> 48:51.962
It's inside of me
down there.

49:14.532 --> 49:15.722
What happened?

49:17.993 --> 49:19.454
They're all dead.

49:19.691 --> 49:20.470
Shot.

49:22.971 --> 49:24.267
Jane shot them all.

49:25.205 --> 49:26.454
Kruipen too?

49:29.174 --> 49:31.665
Why would she do that?

49:33.063 --> 49:34.251
I don't know.

49:42.852 --> 49:43.935
Look, man, I don't know
what a "20" is...

49:43.970 --> 49:46.701
I just know that we're
in trouble and we need help now.

49:47.006 --> 49:49.560
<i>I just need to know where you are.
What are your coordinates?</i>

49:49.665 --> 49:53.006
I don't know where I am, man.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

49:54.490 --> 49:57.865
- David Kruipen's research center.
<i>- Okay, stand by.</i>

50:28.623 --> 50:31.623
Ling, are you all right?

50:32.974 --> 50:35.420
Get out. Get out!

50:44.080 --> 50:46.708
- Evy, what are you doing?
- I need to see her.

50:46.750 --> 50:49.326
- This room is quarantined, Evelyn.
- Please!

50:49.351 --> 50:52.687
Please, you have to trust me.
We need to see her, please.

50:53.073 --> 50:54.685
Please trust me.

50:55.831 --> 50:57.303
Please.

51:22.102 --> 51:23.272
Oh God.

51:24.266 --> 51:25.373
What is it?

51:26.647 --> 51:29.475
- Eggs.
- What do you mean eggs?

51:31.060 --> 51:32.584
Like the ones
from the mammoth?

51:33.374 --> 51:34.272
What?

51:44.602 --> 51:46.170
- Oh my God, did you see that?
- What?

51:46.554 --> 51:47.499
What happened?

51:48.350 --> 51:49.616
The bugs that bit Ling...

51:50.279 --> 51:53.365
...they must be some kind of parasite.
I just saw one. They're inside of Jane.

51:53.747 --> 51:55.108
- We gotta move her.
- We have to get her to the lab.

51:55.133 --> 51:56.885
It's a separate structure.

51:57.104 --> 52:00.194
Come on, use the sheet
to wrap her up.

52:22.068 --> 52:23.248
What is it, Evy?

52:23.930 --> 52:25.381
The bear's infected too.

52:32.235 --> 52:33.787
There's more eggs over here.

52:36.192 --> 52:38.381
I wonder how long they stay
in their larval state.

52:42.148 --> 52:44.529
I radioed for a rescue helicopter.
We're getting out of here.

52:46.063 --> 52:48.096
- How long?
- A few hours if the weather holds.

52:48.183 --> 52:49.553
Oh, thank God.

52:52.417 --> 52:54.037
What, Evy?

52:57.803 --> 53:00.272
We have to call them back
and tell them not to come.

53:00.370 --> 53:02.539
- Excuse me?
- They won't be prepared.

53:03.154 --> 53:04.942
We have to contact
disease control.

53:04.967 --> 53:07.539
They'll have time to study this thing
and decide what to do.

53:07.564 --> 53:08.420
- What?

53:08.516 --> 53:11.233
- Evelyn, we have to get out of here.
- We have to be quarantined.

53:11.290 --> 53:13.029
Quarantined?
Are you out of your mind?

53:13.097 --> 53:15.891
Ling is sick in there. She's been
throwing up. We have to get out of here.

53:15.916 --> 53:18.201
- Federico, you don't understand.
- Hold on, hold on.

53:19.701 --> 53:21.608
Maybe we're jumping
to conclusions.

53:21.909 --> 53:23.411
I mean, we're just
students here.

53:24.280 --> 53:25.670
She's not even a student.

53:26.578 --> 53:29.444
They died out there
because they couldn't stop it!

53:30.617 --> 53:31.615
They're dead?

53:32.701 --> 53:34.959
Jane was trying to stop us
from getting home.

53:35.350 --> 53:38.295
She said don't let them leave...
she was talking about the bugs.

53:38.678 --> 53:40.061
What do you mean?
What bugs?

53:40.522 --> 53:41.424
Look, you don't know that.

53:41.662 --> 53:43.240
We don't know what
happened out there.

53:43.265 --> 53:45.600
- You saw the eggs in the mammoth, Atom.

53:45.808 --> 53:49.090
- Mammoth? Jesus Christ, would somebody
please tell me what's going on here?

53:49.115 --> 53:52.147
There's a wooly mammoth
in a glacier melting out there.

53:52.201 --> 53:55.350
It's full of eggs.
The same ones that are in this bear...

53:55.375 --> 53:59.225
...the same ones that are in Jane, and very
likely, the same ones that are in Ling.

54:01.722 --> 54:02.701
And me.

54:07.354 --> 54:08.428
And Ling?

54:11.321 --> 54:12.162
Fed...

54:13.623 --> 54:15.904
...we think that the insects
that bit Ling...

54:16.895 --> 54:19.442
- They're laying eggs inside.
- What?

54:20.505 --> 54:23.060
They're some sort
of prehistoric parasite that...

54:23.169 --> 54:25.135
... thawed in the ice
inside the mammoth.

54:26.130 --> 54:27.614
This is so sick.

54:28.161 --> 54:30.474
You guys are sick. Where would you
come up with something like this?

54:30.499 --> 54:33.716
We have to contact disease control.
They'll know what to do better than us.

54:34.334 --> 54:36.302
No no.

54:39.733 --> 54:41.052
No no... Hey!
Where are you going?

54:41.081 --> 54:43.114
Hey hey!

54:44.234 --> 54:45.770
We could die here.

54:49.826 --> 54:51.989
Hey, stay away
from the radio!

54:53.376 --> 54:55.177
Don't. Don't!

55:00.045 --> 55:02.810
- Put the gun down!
- I didn't have a choice.

55:08.058 --> 55:11.747
I'm in charge now. Until the helicopter
arrives, I'm in charge!

55:13.261 --> 55:14.833
What was that noise?

55:20.935 --> 55:24.235
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just a scratch.

55:25.060 --> 55:26.466
Oh, Jesus.

55:27.573 --> 55:30.091
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

55:32.512 --> 55:33.911
Soon, baby, soon.

55:38.434 --> 55:39.731
Jesus.

55:42.814 --> 55:43.919
It's the same color as...

55:44.500 --> 55:45.491
As what?

55:46.356 --> 55:48.177
Maybe you'd be
comfortable lying down.

55:48.202 --> 55:49.161
That's a good idea.

55:49.614 --> 55:51.169
Same color as what?

55:52.004 --> 55:53.512
All right, put her
in the spare bedroom.

55:56.565 --> 55:58.567
It's okay, baby.

55:59.083 --> 56:01.575
You'll be fine.
You just need to lie down for a minute.

56:10.269 --> 56:12.895
- Where's Feddy?
- I'm right here, babe.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.708
- When are we going home?
- Soon.

56:18.907 --> 56:20.661
Really soon.
It won't be long now.

56:25.703 --> 56:26.778
Wait.

56:51.552 --> 56:53.071
We need to seal off the room.

56:55.483 --> 56:57.962
- What about me?
- Good question.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.344
You guys need to see this.

57:18.029 --> 57:19.154
What is that?

57:19.976 --> 57:21.694
What do you think it is?

57:24.222 --> 57:25.639
Oh my God.

57:32.843 --> 57:33.686
Ohh.

57:43.823 --> 57:45.279
Do you think they can get out?

57:45.609 --> 57:48.553
No. But we need
to seal that door.

57:49.778 --> 57:50.670
Okay.

57:54.962 --> 57:56.889
I need to do
something about this.

57:59.453 --> 58:00.608
Right now.

58:11.257 --> 58:13.131
Bart, wait.
What are you going to do?

58:14.379 --> 58:17.574
I doubt there's a chopper between
here and Dawson City this time of year.

58:19.067 --> 58:21.277
They're not gonna
be here for a while...

58:21.749 --> 58:23.722
...and I ain't got that kind of time.

58:26.746 --> 58:28.917
If these things hatch,
they'll spread.

58:29.779 --> 58:33.440
If that happens, I'm done.

58:34.928 --> 58:37.473
If I can just kind
of get underneath...

58:37.968 --> 58:39.222
...some of them.

58:46.626 --> 58:47.707
If I can just...

58:51.560 --> 58:54.566
It's starting to come off a little bit.

59:03.957 --> 59:06.136
- Oh shit.
- Oh, Jesus!

59:24.456 --> 59:25.332
No.

59:25.949 --> 59:27.949
No no no,
don't look at me.

59:27.974 --> 59:29.964
Bart, no, you'll lose
too much blood.

59:32.726 --> 59:34.136
Okay, then...

59:35.900 --> 59:37.092
...we'll burn them out then.

59:37.218 --> 59:39.582
I don't see why not. We'll just
douse the arm in gasoline.

59:39.653 --> 59:42.222
How do you know if you'll get them all?
You'll have to burn it to the bone.

59:50.095 --> 59:51.316
If you don't do it...

59:52.404 --> 59:53.386
I will.

59:55.275 --> 59:56.878
We have to be
more prepared.

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:16.295
Are you sure about this?
I don't even know if this is morphine.

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.194
The worst that can
happen is that I OD.

01:00:21.161 --> 01:00:23.256
There are worse ways to go.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.733
Go on, man, jab it in.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.615
Jeez Louise.

01:00:53.463 --> 01:00:54.826
There we go.

01:00:55.897 --> 01:00:57.858
Oooh, a guy could
get used to that.

01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:13.904
All right, man, do it.

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.506
Something's happening
in there.

01:01:26.021 --> 01:01:27.272
They're hatching.

01:01:31.506 --> 01:01:34.217
Okay.
Okay, here we go.

01:01:35.235 --> 01:01:36.576
Atom, hurry!

01:01:37.725 --> 01:01:39.592
Do you believe in what I see?

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:48.522
This isn't right.
You can't just chop off body parts.

01:01:51.258 --> 01:01:52.529
This isn't the way.

01:01:54.325 --> 01:01:55.811
- Atom.
- Do it.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:56.936
Atom!

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.337
- Atom, do it again!
- Oooh.

01:02:02.613 --> 01:02:03.600
Atom!

01:02:18.834 --> 01:02:20.787
- Evelyn.
- Oh my God.

01:02:22.424 --> 01:02:23.545
Bart.

01:02:26.116 --> 01:02:27.428
Get the bugs.

01:02:30.863 --> 01:02:32.873
- With what?
- Try the bug spray.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:39.770
It's not working.

01:02:39.795 --> 01:02:41.670
There's a lighter... try it.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.858
God, I can't stop it.

01:02:52.944 --> 01:02:54.998
It's working.
It's working.

01:02:55.515 --> 01:02:58.518
I need something else to stop
the bleeding. This is not working.

01:02:58.872 --> 01:03:01.514
I saw in the...
ATV kit.

01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:24.147
Is he okay?

01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:27.014
The bleeding's starting to slow.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:29.248
Aw, he could go into shock.

01:03:29.322 --> 01:03:31.623
Get his arm up.
Get his arm up.

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.990
We gotta put him on the couch.
Lie him on his back.

01:03:34.035 --> 01:03:35.620
Okay?
Okay?

01:03:35.772 --> 01:03:38.400
Come on, come on.
There we go.

01:03:38.972 --> 01:03:41.483
- Get some gauze and some tape.
- Okay.

01:03:42.299 --> 01:03:46.185
Lie him on his back. Okay, wait...
put his feet up, okay?

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.170
- Put his feet up.
- Oh, fuck.

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:50.334
There we go.
There we go, buddy.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.451
Got the tape.
We need some gauze.

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:56.194
Shit.

01:03:59.479 --> 01:04:01.201
What the hell?

01:04:04.672 --> 01:04:05.944
Shit.

01:04:16.159 --> 01:04:17.865
It looks like they knew
what they were dealing with.

01:04:18.937 --> 01:04:19.686
Who?

01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:22.498
Dr. Kruipen.

01:04:27.107 --> 01:04:28.717
It's a vertebrate.
It's not a bug.

01:04:29.224 --> 01:04:31.800
- So we're related to this thing?
- Yeah.

01:04:32.455 --> 01:04:35.668
It says that the males are harmless,
except for they create the sores...

01:04:35.693 --> 01:04:38.696
...that the females bore into
and then they lay their eggs...

01:04:39.147 --> 01:04:40.175
...and multiply.

01:04:40.494 --> 01:04:41.589
What are you saying?

01:04:41.775 --> 01:04:44.517
If you're bit by a male you
might not necessarily be infected?

01:04:45.065 --> 01:04:46.446
Yeah, the eggs
are the only threat.

01:04:48.415 --> 01:04:50.532
These tapes, they only
date up to yesterday.

01:04:50.817 --> 01:04:52.407
We have to see what's on them.
We need to know...

01:04:52.432 --> 01:04:54.267
...exactly what we're
dealing with right now.

01:04:54.874 --> 01:04:57.767
This tape's the most recent.
Where's my dad's camera?

01:04:58.915 --> 01:05:01.564
It's with Jane's jacket.
But we put all that stuff in the lab.

01:05:10.233 --> 01:05:12.915
- What the hell are you doing?
- We have to get in there.

01:05:13.383 --> 01:05:15.400
You're not going back in there.
It's completely sealed.

01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:17.302
You're just going to bring
those bugs back in here with you.

01:05:17.342 --> 01:05:19.665
We need to get the information
before the helicopter gets here.

01:05:21.203 --> 01:05:23.570
There might be something
in there that can help Ling.

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:27.009
Maybe save us all.

01:05:29.095 --> 01:05:31.829
You get any bugs on you,
you're not coming back in here.

01:06:39.275 --> 01:06:41.370
Evelyn!
Behind you!

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:44.839
Shit.

01:06:46.746 --> 01:06:50.124
There's no fucking way she's getting
in here. She's covered in bugs.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.143
- Back off!
- Let me out! Let me out!

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:55.206
No no!

01:06:56.761 --> 01:06:58.870
There's... There's...
there's bugs on her!

01:07:01.837 --> 01:07:03.487
Atom, step away from her.

01:07:04.546 --> 01:07:05.948
Atom, step away.

01:07:07.487 --> 01:07:08.979
There's one under my shirt!

01:07:09.881 --> 01:07:10.847
God!

01:07:13.132 --> 01:07:14.932
What the fuck is that?

01:07:15.294 --> 01:07:16.518
Get it out.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.308
Get it!

01:07:22.498 --> 01:07:23.270
It's fine.

01:07:23.997 --> 01:07:25.737
What if it laid eggs in her?
Huh?

01:07:25.767 --> 01:07:27.222
I got it. She's fine.

01:07:27.259 --> 01:07:29.553
All right. Um...

01:07:30.688 --> 01:07:31.776
...the rest now.

01:07:32.814 --> 01:07:34.604
She's clean, Fed.
Drop it.

01:07:34.982 --> 01:07:36.433
Take the rest
of your clothes off.

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:39.372
- Now.
- It's okay.

01:07:40.706 --> 01:07:41.651
He's right.

01:07:42.932 --> 01:07:44.503
Atom, I need you
to check me.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:25.401
She's clean.

01:08:26.443 --> 01:08:27.331
Okay.

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:38.416
I had to be sure.

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:19.694
Are you sure you
want to see this?

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.232
Of course.

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:26.724
I'm really sorry,
you know?

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:32.045
Whatever happened between you
and your dad, I know it must be hard.

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:36.732
The weather's cleaning up.
They should be here soon.

01:09:37.852 --> 01:09:39.872
What exactly are you guys
trying to find on that tape?

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:42.459
I mean, they're bugs and they
eat people... it's that simple.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:45.372
We need to know what's gonna
happen if the bugs get off the island.

01:09:45.478 --> 01:09:46.926
What kind of habitat
can they survive in?

01:09:46.959 --> 01:09:48.684
What are the odds
of this turning into a pandemic?

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.348
My dad would have
thought this through.

01:09:50.528 --> 01:09:52.435
We have to get that
information back.

01:09:56.387 --> 01:09:58.506
"Today I rediscovered...

01:09:59.085 --> 01:10:02.623
...what I knew when
I was young.

01:10:05.306 --> 01:10:06.834
Whoa!
One got out.

01:10:07.358 --> 01:10:08.482
Somebody kill it.

01:10:58.928 --> 01:11:00.398
Oh my God.

01:11:15.851 --> 01:11:18.061
It's time to get out of here.

01:11:18.162 --> 01:11:20.081
We have to get
to the helicopter.

01:11:20.106 --> 01:11:22.633
It's the only safe place.
Everything else should be burned.

01:11:23.798 --> 01:11:26.171
- Help me! Help me!
- Oh my God.

01:11:26.608 --> 01:11:28.405
Shit, they're coming
through the vents.

01:11:30.799 --> 01:11:32.265
- We've got to get her out of there.
- No, we can't.

01:11:32.305 --> 01:11:34.718
- There's too many. It's too dangerous.
- We gotta do something.

01:11:34.775 --> 01:11:35.976
What's going on?

01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:39.539
The vertebrates...
they're with Ling.

01:11:41.982 --> 01:11:45.687
We gotta sedate her.
Get me some drugs, man.

01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:48.414
Get me something to wear...
something protective.

01:11:48.439 --> 01:11:50.357
Jeez, you almost fell.

01:11:50.829 --> 01:11:53.101
You gotta loosen this.
It's too tight.

01:11:55.052 --> 01:11:56.570
I can't.

01:12:01.154 --> 01:12:02.452
Feddy!

01:12:02.742 --> 01:12:05.453
Feddy, open this door, Feddy.

01:12:05.714 --> 01:12:07.261
- Almost got it.
- Agh.

01:12:09.214 --> 01:12:10.894
Help me, Feddy.

01:12:11.723 --> 01:12:14.855
Oh, please,
you have them too.

01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:27.707
Feddy, what are you doing?

01:12:32.179 --> 01:12:34.347
She was suffering.
She asked me to.

01:12:47.805 --> 01:12:49.574
She's still alive.

01:12:50.556 --> 01:12:52.066
You son of a bitch.

01:13:02.864 --> 01:13:04.324
I gotta sedate her.

01:13:16.874 --> 01:13:18.282
Bart, wait.

01:13:21.407 --> 01:13:22.642
It's okay, Evy.

01:13:23.714 --> 01:13:25.493
- I got nothing to lose.
- No.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:39.165
Evelyn, come on.
Come on, we've gotta go.

01:14:18.811 --> 01:14:21.531
We need to make sure
everyone's clean before we leave.

01:14:24.942 --> 01:14:26.961
I'm going straight
to the helicopter.

01:14:34.962 --> 01:14:37.055
Anybody who wants to leave
can come with me.

01:14:38.925 --> 01:14:41.703
It's just a precaution.
We're not accusing you of anything.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.000
We just want to be sure.

01:14:47.801 --> 01:14:49.125
Fuck that.

01:14:50.582 --> 01:14:51.985
Federico, wait!

01:14:54.439 --> 01:14:57.313
You can't go in there.
I know why you shot Ling.

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.766
You're gonna fuck
this up, aren't you?

01:15:05.256 --> 01:15:08.172
- Fed...
- Shut the fuck up, Atom.

01:15:09.132 --> 01:15:12.078
Soon as the helicopter gets here,
she's gonna blow the whistle on me.

01:15:12.226 --> 01:15:15.336
And that means I'm gonna
die with these fucking bugs in my dick.

01:15:19.392 --> 01:15:20.750
I can't let that happen.

01:15:22.035 --> 01:15:23.500
Please don't.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.563
I'm sorry.

01:15:31.062 --> 01:15:32.102
Dad?

01:15:33.127 --> 01:15:34.946
- Dad!
- Kruipen.

01:15:37.045 --> 01:15:39.339
Oh my God,
you're alive!

01:15:39.897 --> 01:15:41.117
I'm sorry.

01:15:42.549 --> 01:15:43.852
Me too.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:45.992
I'm so sorry.

01:15:46.651 --> 01:15:48.461
- Are you infected?
- No.

01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:52.914
You're shot.

01:15:53.665 --> 01:15:55.132
I'm okay.

01:15:56.438 --> 01:15:57.500
Jane...

01:15:58.050 --> 01:15:59.852
Jane died.

01:16:00.217 --> 01:16:01.867
She sabotaged
the helicopter.

01:16:02.802 --> 01:16:04.813
It's okay though.
We already called for help.

01:16:05.136 --> 01:16:08.196
The whole place...
it's almost entirely infested.

01:16:08.221 --> 01:16:10.602
Now the only safe place
is the helicopter.

01:16:11.431 --> 01:16:12.977
We're gonna burn it down.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.438
There's some gasoline
around the back.

01:16:18.344 --> 01:16:21.264
- You should wait in the helicopter.
- I'll be okay. Go on.

01:16:21.478 --> 01:16:23.860
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

01:16:53.113 --> 01:16:55.725
Bet you wish you didn't
get on that helicopter now, huh?

01:17:00.178 --> 01:17:01.221
What?

01:17:02.253 --> 01:17:03.201
What?

01:17:04.352 --> 01:17:05.787
He knew.

01:17:15.996 --> 01:17:19.326
"These parasites were
discovered in a thawing glacier.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.717
They are just one...

01:17:21.864 --> 01:17:25.397
...of the horrors that will
come from global warming.

01:17:26.078 --> 01:17:27.872
And so today I...

01:17:28.517 --> 01:17:30.756
...prepare this statement...

01:17:31.973 --> 01:17:34.201
...as I prepare myself...

01:17:34.532 --> 01:17:38.365
...for the ultimate sacrifice,
the only sacrifice.

01:17:38.604 --> 01:17:40.530
Though thousands will...

01:17:40.557 --> 01:17:43.552
...die the threat will surely
be contained.

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:47.998
This video, too,
will surely be contained.

01:17:49.022 --> 01:17:51.865
But the impact of both...

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.600
...will survive...

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.623
...spread through the veins
of the internet...

01:17:55.656 --> 01:17:57.311
...onto the screens
of the youth...

01:17:58.523 --> 01:18:00.569
...into your souls...

01:18:00.767 --> 01:18:02.069
...into your spirit.

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:04.928
You will know the need
to sacrifice.

01:18:04.953 --> 01:18:07.405
You will know
the time is now.

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:41.491
You were right, Evy.
No one cares.

01:18:42.948 --> 01:18:44.671
May I have the tape, please?

01:18:44.696 --> 01:18:48.139
Dad, please. Please don't do this.
There has to be another way.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.045
Please.
People listen to you.

01:18:51.112 --> 01:18:54.240
- You didn't.
- I only said that to hurt you.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.467
You were right.
You've always been right.

01:18:56.492 --> 01:19:00.413
We can change people's minds, but, Dad,
this is not the way to do it, please.

01:19:00.574 --> 01:19:02.409
I'm getting on the helicopter.

01:19:02.725 --> 01:19:03.788
Alone.

01:19:04.571 --> 01:19:07.436
When the fear...
when it spreads...

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.077
...the people will know.

01:19:09.268 --> 01:19:11.538
- You can't go.
- Maybe he's right.

01:19:12.274 --> 01:19:14.151
How could he
possibly be right?

01:19:14.277 --> 01:19:18.217
Dad, you were going to save me.
What about everybody else?

01:19:18.242 --> 01:19:20.788
What about
other people's children?

01:19:20.813 --> 01:19:23.608
How do you know how quickly
they'll be able to isolate it?

01:19:23.808 --> 01:19:26.272
How many people
are going to die? Thousands.

01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:30.491
Maybe hundreds of thousands.
Plenty more where they came from, right?

01:19:31.673 --> 01:19:34.005
Please. Please don't.

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:38.841
I'm sorry.

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:47.677
Dad!

01:19:49.199 --> 01:19:50.084
No!

01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:54.552
- No.
- The window... gotta go to the window.

01:19:57.412 --> 01:19:58.982
Oh my God.

01:20:07.396 --> 01:20:09.638
<i>That's Dr. Kruipen.
He looks hurt.</i>

01:20:17.618 --> 01:20:19.271
Are you okay?

01:20:19.442 --> 01:20:22.068
- I should take a look at that.
- No, let's go.

01:20:29.716 --> 01:20:31.339
Hey, is there
somebody else in there?

01:20:32.773 --> 01:20:35.152
Quarantine.
They're contaminated.

01:20:35.237 --> 01:20:38.386
- Are you contaminated?
- No. Let's go.

01:20:38.411 --> 01:20:39.823
Aw, shit!

01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:43.519
Stop, he's infected!

01:20:44.129 --> 01:20:46.519
Stop, this whole area's
quarantined!

01:20:49.827 --> 01:20:53.112
- He's on the skid.
- If he gets in, we die.

01:20:54.292 --> 01:20:55.465
He's infected.

01:20:56.153 --> 01:20:58.581
- What did he say?
- This whole area's quarantined.

01:20:58.606 --> 01:21:01.300
Something about the quarantine.
We've got to put him down.

01:21:01.325 --> 01:21:02.050
We can't.

01:21:04.388 --> 01:21:05.792
He's infected.

01:21:06.263 --> 01:21:09.081
He's rocking us.
I can't stabilize it.

01:21:16.224 --> 01:21:19.870
- Jesus Christ. Is he okay?
- He's not moving.

01:21:24.103 --> 01:21:26.362
- We need to go now.
- What about her?

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:29.025
- She'll be okay.
- No.

01:21:30.106 --> 01:21:31.034
No.

01:21:39.236 --> 01:21:40.511
Hey, she's got a gun!

01:21:42.218 --> 01:21:43.362
Get up, get up!

01:21:43.387 --> 01:21:44.652
Aw, fuck!

01:21:48.969 --> 01:21:50.136
Fuck!

01:21:53.507 --> 01:21:54.823
Come on!

01:22:25.175 --> 01:22:27.761
Oh my God, no, we need
to get you to the helicopter.

01:22:27.881 --> 01:22:30.287
No, it's too late.

01:22:30.483 --> 01:22:32.294
- No.
- It's too late.

01:22:33.496 --> 01:22:37.623
You have to... you have to get your
father's notes. You have to warn them.

01:22:38.493 --> 01:22:39.655
I can't.

01:22:40.219 --> 01:22:42.248
No, I can't leave you here.
I can't do this.

01:22:42.273 --> 01:22:43.881
Yes, you can, Evy.

01:22:46.185 --> 01:22:47.272
This is it.

01:22:50.974 --> 01:22:52.741
The ball's rolling.

01:22:57.449 --> 01:22:59.233
This is the beginning.

01:23:04.108 --> 01:23:06.819
No. No.

01:24:59.749 --> 01:25:01.213
What is sacrifice?

01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:04.437
We keep saying
we want change...

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.986
...but we just keep doing the same
shitty things every day.

01:25:07.366 --> 01:25:10.953
And that's no justification
for what my father did.

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.971
Or what he tried to do.

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:16.885
A body! There's a body
over here!

01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:19.689
But I want people to know that he
really did believe he was helping us...

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:21.689
...and he sacrificed
everything...

01:25:22.533 --> 01:25:23.955
including himself.

01:25:25.107 --> 01:25:26.361
I have a pulse!

01:25:27.072 --> 01:25:29.127
Come on, let's get
her out of there!

01:25:29.364 --> 01:25:32.117
I used to believe that
people couldn't change...

01:25:32.409 --> 01:25:34.236
...that all we could do was just...

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.127
...have as much fun as we could
before it all came to an end.

01:25:39.254 --> 01:25:40.182
But now...

01:25:41.789 --> 01:25:43.377
...now I don't want it to end.

01:26:08.777 --> 01:26:10.610
<i>All right, we're back and today...</i>

01:26:10.642 --> 01:26:12.769
<i>...we're talking
about Evelyn Kruipen...</i>

01:26:12.794 --> 01:26:15.922
<i>...daughter of infamous ecologist,
Dr. David Kruipen.</i>

01:26:16.268 --> 01:26:18.229
- Max!
<i>- Now she's being hailed as a hero.</i>

01:26:18.254 --> 01:26:21.321
- Max, come on.
<i>- She's on the front of every newspaper...</i>

01:26:21.346 --> 01:26:23.321
<i>- and websites around the globe.</i>
- Come on, boy, let's go.

01:26:23.346 --> 01:26:26.188
<i>The Center for Disease Control
said this young woman...</i>

01:26:26.221 --> 01:26:28.348
<i>...saved us from total annihilation.</i>

01:26:28.861 --> 01:26:30.697
<i>Well, I don't know, Mike.</i>

01:26:30.722 --> 01:26:34.642
<i>You're a bit of a conspiracy nut.
What do you think?</i>

01:26:42.599 --> 01:26:44.407
<i>Well, callers, what do you think?</i>

01:26:44.432 --> 01:26:47.059
<i>What is going to end
the human race?</i>

01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:49.235
<i>A giant meteor out of the sky?</i>

01:26:49.349 --> 01:26:51.126
<i>Are we all going
to starve to death?</i>

01:26:51.278 --> 01:26:54.781
<i>Or is a tiny little bug going
to come and wipe us all out?</i>

01:26:55.042 --> 01:26:56.478
<i>First caller, you're on the air.</i>

01:26:56.762 --> 01:26:59.579
<i>I honestly think it's just more
global warming propaganda.</i>

01:26:59.604 --> 01:27:02.345
<i>I... I think the whole thing's
just a marketing scam.</i>

01:27:02.586 --> 01:27:05.079
<i>It's just another example of
how vulnerable we are, you know.</i>

01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:07.047
<i>You've got SARS, bird flu, AIDS.</i>

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.665
<i>It's just a matter of time
before the big one hits.</i>
