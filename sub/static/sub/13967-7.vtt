<i>Previously on</i> Tyrant...

COGSWELL: <i>There's been some chatter</i>

00:21.966 --> 00:24.199
<i>about something bigger
planned, but we don't know where,</i>

00:24.224 --> 00:25.923
<i>and we don't know when.</i>

00:25.948 --> 00:27.868
I'll kill them all if I have to.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.537
<i>I have authorized our
security forces to arrest</i>

00:30.573 --> 00:31.872
<i>anyone who has collaborated</i>

00:31.907 --> 00:34.174
- <i>with terrorists.</i>
- I need to see Ihab.

00:34.209 --> 00:35.409
Face-to-face.

00:35.444 --> 00:37.544
You're finally waking up to the truth.

00:37.580 --> 00:40.146
I'm asking you to give me a
chance to win this election.

00:40.182 --> 00:41.548
There will be no election.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.984
<i>Oh, but there will be a war.</i>

00:44.019 --> 00:45.696
MALOOF: <i>And when Al-Qadi
comes home, we'll be waiting.</i>

00:45.720 --> 00:47.687
BARRY: <i>We'll find him and
we'll kill him, too.</i>

00:47.722 --> 00:49.722
- Welcome home.
- BARRY: <i>Your brother-in-law</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:50.790
was in contact

00:50.825 --> 00:53.026
with Ihab to arrange the
meeting the very same day

00:53.061 --> 00:55.996
<i>that he plotted the
massacre at the Commission.</i>

00:56.031 --> 00:57.797
Go ahead, arrest me.

00:57.832 --> 00:59.933
You're gonna be put on trial
for who you really are.

00:59.968 --> 01:01.846
REPORTER: The government of
President Bassam Al Fayeed

01:01.870 --> 01:03.236
has formally banned

01:03.272 --> 01:04.672
<i>Sheik Hussein Al-Qadi from standing</i>

01:04.706 --> 01:06.273
<i>in the presidential election.</i>

01:06.308 --> 01:08.008
This violence is taking its toll

01:08.043 --> 01:09.542
on Bassam's support.

01:09.577 --> 01:14.381
I'm resigning my
post as Foreign Secretary.

01:14.792 --> 01:16.325
MALOOF: Professor Haitham El-Amin.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.628
He's part of a new generation
of anti-government bloggers.

01:19.664 --> 01:21.138
This guy's the most influential.

01:21.276 --> 01:22.942
You're sleeping with Professor El-Amin.

01:22.966 --> 01:25.066
He's been writing blogs about
me being responsible

01:25.102 --> 01:26.735
<i>for the violence in Abuddin.</i>

01:26.771 --> 01:28.067
I'm in love for the first time

01:28.197 --> 01:29.570
<i>in 25 years.</i>

01:29.606 --> 01:30.505
Just so you know,

01:30.540 --> 01:33.541
I'm not gonna go easy
on the administration.

01:33.576 --> 01:35.443
You might come under fire yourself.

01:35.478 --> 01:37.012
Anything else?

01:37.047 --> 01:38.599
Yes.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.521
I'm going to win this election.

01:43.411 --> 01:45.611
(crickets chirping)

01:48.049 --> 01:50.783
(breathing deeply)

01:53.955 --> 01:55.387
(groans)

01:55.423 --> 01:56.923
Daliyah?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.434
Don't worry, it won't stain.

02:11.939 --> 02:14.639
Remember when I got this shirt?

02:14.675 --> 02:18.477
We went to that giant
mall in Orange County.

02:18.512 --> 02:22.013
Mom got you that hoodie you
thought looked feminine.

02:22.048 --> 02:24.215
Right, it was pink.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.184
It was lavender.

02:27.921 --> 02:30.522
Emma, honey, you woke me up again.

02:30.557 --> 02:32.891
I'm sorry.

02:32.926 --> 02:35.460
Do you want me to sing you a lullaby?

02:36.763 --> 02:40.131
No, sweetheart, I just
need you to let me sleep.

02:40.166 --> 02:41.332
Well,

02:41.368 --> 02:44.703
is he dead yet?

02:48.375 --> 02:50.942
Not yet.

02:53.146 --> 02:55.480
Soon.

02:55.515 --> 02:57.448
That's what you said last time.

03:00.253 --> 03:02.520
(inhales deeply)

03:02.555 --> 03:05.323
I'm trying, sweetie.

03:05.358 --> 03:08.026
Try harder.

03:09.862 --> 03:12.163
(sobbing)

03:14.700 --> 03:17.835
(whispering): Bassam?

03:17.870 --> 03:20.938
Bassam.

03:22.442 --> 03:24.975
You're shaking.

03:25.011 --> 03:27.378
(sighs)

03:27.414 --> 03:29.613
(breathing heavily)

03:34.921 --> 03:37.287
I'm so sorry I'm late, but honestly,

03:37.322 --> 03:39.790
you don't have to wait up for me.

03:46.065 --> 03:50.233
I'm going to meet with Al-Qadi tomorrow.

03:53.839 --> 03:55.005
What?

03:55.041 --> 03:56.774
I know I might be
playing with fire, but...

03:56.809 --> 03:59.009
In more ways than you think.

04:01.047 --> 04:03.681
These were sent to the campaign today.

04:10.656 --> 04:12.155
Who sent them?

04:12.191 --> 04:14.658
Someone who's trying to
embarrass you, obviously.

04:14.694 --> 04:17.127
Why send them here? Why
not post them online?

04:17.161 --> 04:18.495
Money.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.762
He wants 50,000 U.S. dollars.

04:20.798 --> 04:24.468
Which I will pay him in
order to shut this down.

04:24.503 --> 04:27.870
But this has to stop.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.308
Safiya said she'll take care of it.

04:31.343 --> 04:34.544
Maybe I better do that.

04:34.580 --> 04:35.745
I don't think that's smart.

04:35.780 --> 04:37.880
I think we should keep our distance.

04:37.916 --> 04:40.650
My sister is very resourceful.

04:40.685 --> 04:42.652
It will be safer that way.

04:44.389 --> 04:46.523
Are we being stupid?

04:49.528 --> 04:52.762
We have a lot to lose, both of us.

04:54.466 --> 04:56.633
Take off your clothes.

05:18.456 --> 05:20.689
(both breathing heavily)

05:27.965 --> 05:30.232
I want two things in my life.

05:35.439 --> 05:38.274
I want to do my job...

05:38.309 --> 05:39.808
and I want you.

05:44.882 --> 05:47.282
I'm not afraid of taking risks.

05:49.086 --> 05:52.754
Not being alive.

05:52.790 --> 05:55.057
That's what I'm afraid of.

06:25.089 --> 06:27.122
♪ ♪

06:29.658 --> 06:31.892
(both grunt)

06:56.252 --> 06:57.551
(breathing shakily)

06:57.586 --> 06:58.986
Are you all right?

06:59.021 --> 07:00.221
(exhales)

07:01.758 --> 07:03.357
(clears throat)

07:03.392 --> 07:04.859
I can go.

07:08.597 --> 07:11.330
No, no.

07:11.366 --> 07:13.099
Stay.

07:20.142 --> 07:21.775
(both moaning)

07:33.454 --> 07:36.422
(Ihab moaning louder)

07:50.772 --> 07:53.306
FAUZI: If Sheik Al-Qadi
is guilty of a crime,

07:53.341 --> 07:54.674
let him be charged with it.

07:54.709 --> 07:57.142
But whether he's worthy of office

07:57.178 --> 07:59.912
is for the people of Abuddin to decide

07:59.947 --> 08:01.480
and not the sitting president.

08:01.516 --> 08:03.683
Now, I may be the heir

08:03.718 --> 08:06.485
to my friend, Bassam's, revolution,

08:06.521 --> 08:08.521
but I'm not his twin.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.356
And on this we disagree.

08:10.391 --> 08:13.225
And my administration will reflect that.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.328
Truth.

08:15.363 --> 08:16.495
Reconciliation.

08:16.531 --> 08:19.799
Those powerful words ring hollow now.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.166
(TV turns off) He's winning.

08:21.202 --> 08:23.436
He doesn't need to say these things.

08:24.639 --> 08:26.305
What?

08:26.341 --> 08:29.208
He is allowed to disagree with you.

08:29.243 --> 08:30.508
Even in public.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.977
You think he's right, don't you?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.544
I didn't say that.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.080
No, you didn't say it, but you do.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.082
I think he's right.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.784
Did you two talk about this?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.754
What?

08:42.789 --> 08:45.324
No, you sound paranoid.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.726
You know, I wish people would
stop saying that to me.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.961
He loves you.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.630
We both do. We're both concerned.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.798
Separately.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.067
Are you?

08:56.603 --> 08:57.769
Yes.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.938
Neither one of you has any idea

08:59.974 --> 09:02.407
- what it is like to do this job.
- You're right.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.843
To be the one charged with
keeping people safe.

09:04.879 --> 09:06.912
- When there's no room for mistakes.
- Of course.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.248
Fauzi doesn't have a
clue, and neither do you.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.452
I'm going to go.

09:14.488 --> 09:15.820
I should go.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.022
Wait, wait, wait.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.625
I'm sorry.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.193
Don't go.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.397
I don't want to waste our time together.

09:25.432 --> 09:27.365
It's the one thing I look forward to.

09:27.401 --> 09:31.369
I look forward to it,
too, more than you even know.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.938
But I'm not just the
woman you sleep with

09:33.973 --> 09:36.407
in some anonymous room.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.575
Take some time.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.011
Think.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.913
And try and sleep.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.656
This is dangerous.

09:52.691 --> 09:54.558
For both of us.

09:54.593 --> 09:55.826
Yes, it is.

09:55.861 --> 09:58.062
I'll start by saying thank you.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.298
I appreciate your resignation.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.865
Now, why am I here?

10:01.901 --> 10:03.301
I want to know what really happened

10:03.336 --> 10:05.069
when you met with Ihab bin Rashid.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.704
It won't matter. You won't believe me.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.073
Try me. (sighs)

10:11.676 --> 10:13.176
I thought I could convince him

10:13.211 --> 10:16.479
that we both want the
same thing for Abuddin.

10:16.514 --> 10:19.215
I was wrong.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.052
I assumed I could succeed or die.

10:22.087 --> 10:25.155
And I was prepared for both.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.557
I was wrong about that, too.

10:27.592 --> 10:28.825
I ended up being used.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.561
The Caliphate has two
enemies inside Abuddin

10:31.596 --> 10:32.795
that scare them:

10:32.831 --> 10:34.564
Bassam...

10:34.599 --> 10:37.533
and me.

10:37.569 --> 10:40.837
One photograph took care of both of us.

10:40.872 --> 10:42.872
I'm outlawed,

10:42.907 --> 10:45.608
and Bassam proved
himself the enemy of Islam.

10:46.845 --> 10:48.811
You think I'm lying?

10:48.847 --> 10:51.080
I think you're telling the truth.

10:51.115 --> 10:54.683
The offer you made Ihab,

10:54.718 --> 10:57.019
I'm offering you the same thing.

10:57.054 --> 10:59.654
- A partnership, between us.
- You?

10:59.690 --> 11:02.224
I will be the president and you
will be my prime minister.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.393
- Impossible.
- Nothing is impossible.

11:04.428 --> 11:07.129
Bassam said you could not
run, and you won't be running,

11:07.285 --> 11:08.017
I will.

11:08.162 --> 11:09.831
N-not that.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.500
We want different things, madam.

11:11.535 --> 11:14.569
No, we want the same thing...
To win this election.

11:14.605 --> 11:17.339
And, unfortunately, the
only way that will happen

11:17.375 --> 11:21.410
is for us to reach some
kind of compromise.

11:21.445 --> 11:23.612
Otherwise, Fauzi
Nidal is about to become

11:23.647 --> 11:25.079
the President of Abuddin.

11:26.416 --> 11:31.052
Some gulfs are too
wide to cross, I'm afraid.

11:48.539 --> 11:51.205
Better?

11:53.043 --> 11:56.945
We need to start somewhere.

11:56.980 --> 11:59.146
MOHAMMED: Our intelligence suggests

11:59.181 --> 12:00.893
that with the help of
the American military,

12:00.917 --> 12:02.950
their strength is growing rapidly.

12:02.985 --> 12:05.085
They are moving
towards a ground war with us.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.488
This is precisely the kind of mistake

12:08.524 --> 12:10.402
- we want Bassam to make.
- Not if it comes too soon.

12:10.426 --> 12:12.927
I worry that we won't
be ready for an onslaught

12:12.962 --> 12:14.628
from an American-backed Abuddinian Army.

12:14.664 --> 12:16.575
TALAL: Between the bombing
by the Russians and the Kurds

12:16.599 --> 12:19.332
on the ground, we've lost
more than 1,000 soldiers.

12:19.368 --> 12:20.901
IHAB: I wouldn't worry.

12:20.937 --> 12:23.704
When the holy war begins,

12:23.739 --> 12:25.305
the true believers will flock.

12:25.340 --> 12:28.075
The Americans will
arrive well before they do.

12:28.110 --> 12:29.443
You need to have more faith.

12:29.478 --> 12:31.645
- And you need to watch your place.
- My place?

12:31.681 --> 12:33.279
What place is that?

12:33.314 --> 12:34.213
Enough.

12:34.248 --> 12:36.849
Fighting among ourselves, losing focus.

12:36.885 --> 12:39.452
This doesn't help our cause.

12:39.487 --> 12:42.073
He's willing to kill us all to
avenge the death of a woman.

12:42.164 --> 12:43.000
TALAL: For Samira Nidal,

12:43.024 --> 12:44.490
we turn back to Abuddin?

12:45.860 --> 12:48.561
I want us back in Abuddin.

12:51.165 --> 12:52.710
COGSWELL: <i>The Bradley
Fighting Vehicles arrived</i>

12:52.734 --> 12:54.333
<i>from Europe this morning.</i>

12:54.368 --> 12:56.168
MALOOF: <i>You've added
3,700 ground soldiers</i>

12:56.204 --> 12:57.403
<i>in the past month.</i>

12:57.438 --> 12:58.972
BARRY: <i>You just need to tell me</i>

12:59.007 --> 13:00.172
if we're ready or not.

13:00.208 --> 13:01.641
We're ready, Mr. President.

13:01.676 --> 13:04.076
Very soon.

13:05.079 --> 13:06.479
You don't agree, General?

13:06.514 --> 13:08.981
MALOOF: General Cogswell
does not take into account

13:09.016 --> 13:11.049
the fervor of the Abuddinian soldiers,

13:11.085 --> 13:13.119
their willingness to
die for their country.

13:13.154 --> 13:16.822
I'm a little old for
macho optimism, Mr. President.

13:16.857 --> 13:18.491
Here's the truth.

13:18.526 --> 13:20.559
This is going to be a long war.

13:20.595 --> 13:23.629
Every war is longer than you
think it's going to be.

13:23.664 --> 13:25.231
You'll be strongest on your first day,

13:25.266 --> 13:27.233
and every day after
that, you'll get weaker

13:27.268 --> 13:28.400
and they'll get stronger.

13:28.436 --> 13:30.302
You're going to be mired in Syria,

13:30.338 --> 13:31.837
which is their territory.

13:31.872 --> 13:33.772
You think you know fervor, General?

13:33.807 --> 13:35.006
This is an end-of-days cult.

13:35.041 --> 13:37.642
You have no idea what real fervor is.

13:37.677 --> 13:40.311
Unless you overwhelm
them from the start,

13:40.347 --> 13:41.924
you're gonna fight
them to a draw at best,

13:41.948 --> 13:43.181
which means they win.

13:43.216 --> 13:45.250
And you've got one
chance to get it right.

13:45.285 --> 13:47.585
So until then, he does nothing?

13:47.722 --> 13:48.710
Correct.

13:48.735 --> 13:50.035
You're not ready to send in

13:50.060 --> 13:51.644
troops and you can't find
me Ihab and the sheik.

13:51.669 --> 13:53.925
- Mr. President...
- You two figure this out!

13:53.961 --> 13:55.961
This election is two months away.

13:55.996 --> 13:57.895
I'm running out of time as president.

15:22.274 --> 15:26.344
My parents still want me
to have an arranged marriage.

15:26.379 --> 15:28.111
Like they did.

15:28.147 --> 15:30.289
Oh, well then.

15:30.314 --> 15:31.649
Oh, no.

15:31.684 --> 15:33.020
No way.

15:33.288 --> 15:34.687
Looking at them

15:34.722 --> 15:37.423
is exactly why I know I can't.

15:39.527 --> 15:41.760
(quiet laugh)

15:58.178 --> 16:00.579
I want to lose my virginity to you.

(laughs)

16:01.715 --> 16:03.115
What?

16:03.150 --> 16:04.949
We have class in 20 minutes.

16:06.153 --> 16:07.819
Well, not now. I mean...

16:07.854 --> 16:09.353
one day soon.

16:09.388 --> 16:12.089
Walk me to class.

16:14.627 --> 16:16.860
(indistinct chatter)

16:16.895 --> 16:18.229
Now I'm embarrassed.

16:18.264 --> 16:19.963
You shouldn't be. It's sweet.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.232
I'm a virgin, too.

16:21.267 --> 16:23.567
(chuckles) Wait, really?

16:23.603 --> 16:24.968
What's that supposed to mean?

16:25.004 --> 16:27.204
I don't know, you're just so well-spoken

16:27.240 --> 16:28.639
and Western and progressive and...

16:28.674 --> 16:30.486
Oh, shut up. Just
because I have a point of view

16:30.510 --> 16:32.276
that doesn't mean I'm...

16:32.311 --> 16:34.678
I'm an Arab woman in an Arab world.

16:34.713 --> 16:37.248
What kind of girl do you think I am?

16:37.283 --> 16:39.116
You don't believe me?

16:39.151 --> 16:41.685
Come on, I believe you.

16:41.720 --> 16:45.321
I've tried to learn about it... sex.

16:45.357 --> 16:49.159
On my own and mostly from porn.

16:49.194 --> 16:51.094
Maybe you can show me?

16:51.130 --> 16:52.729
We can watch one together.

16:52.765 --> 16:55.398
Yeah, well, I'll do some research.

16:55.433 --> 16:56.867
Find a good one for us.

16:56.902 --> 16:58.268
(both laugh)

16:58.303 --> 17:00.971
Sorry.

17:01.974 --> 17:04.473

HAITHAM: <i>And that
changed the entire course</i>

17:58.795 --> 18:01.395
of the Middle East, right
up through the Arab Spring.

18:01.431 --> 18:03.464
For your critiques, I want you to take

18:03.499 --> 18:05.366
one of the countries of the Arab Spring

18:05.401 --> 18:07.068
and write about the election process.

18:07.104 --> 18:08.669
And please...

18:08.705 --> 18:10.171
don't go over three pages.

18:10.207 --> 18:11.339
Economy, people.

18:11.374 --> 18:12.673
Professor El-Amin?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.409
I just wanted to ask you

18:15.445 --> 18:17.112
what's going on with your blog?

18:17.147 --> 18:19.413
- My blog?
- Yeah.

18:19.449 --> 18:20.626
I was working on my last paper,

18:20.650 --> 18:22.016
and I thought it would be helpful.

18:22.052 --> 18:23.784
And it was gone.

18:23.819 --> 18:27.320
Um, I don't post every week.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.521
No, I mean it's gone.

18:28.557 --> 18:29.835
And with everything going on right now

18:29.859 --> 18:31.391
with the election, it just seems

18:31.426 --> 18:33.260
strange that you're not blogging on it.

18:35.664 --> 18:38.932
I have a six-month-old
baby who doesn't sleep.

18:38.968 --> 18:41.735
Honestly, with, uh, my research,

18:41.771 --> 18:44.337
my family, that baby, I'm...

18:44.373 --> 18:46.140
I'm completely blogged out.

18:46.175 --> 18:47.941
Ah, really?

18:47.977 --> 18:51.145
'Cause it kind of feels
like somebody's putting pressure

18:51.180 --> 18:53.613
on you.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.651
You're spying on me now?

18:58.687 --> 19:00.365
How many people did
you have under surveillance

19:00.389 --> 19:02.221
when you were first lady?

19:03.491 --> 19:05.091
Why did you meet with him?

19:05.126 --> 19:06.192
Is that against the law?

19:06.227 --> 19:08.727
I could be, depending on
what you talked about.

19:11.132 --> 19:12.431
He's telling the truth.

19:12.466 --> 19:13.706
He thought he was going to die.

19:13.734 --> 19:15.101
That Ihab would kill him.

19:15.136 --> 19:16.169
Instead they used him.

19:16.204 --> 19:18.504
They used him?

19:18.539 --> 19:21.174
What would he have told you differently

19:21.209 --> 19:22.541
if he were guilty?

19:22.576 --> 19:24.010
Did it even

19:24.045 --> 19:26.478
occur to you that he might be using you?

19:26.514 --> 19:28.380
My instincts say no.

19:28.416 --> 19:29.949
(chuckles) Your instincts.

19:29.984 --> 19:31.884
That's a big chance you're taking

19:31.920 --> 19:34.020
with this country's
future based on a hunch.

19:34.055 --> 19:38.089
So, all you wanted to
do was hear his story?

19:40.393 --> 19:43.061
Tell me why you met with him!

19:43.096 --> 19:45.363
Are you trying to scare
me? Is that what you're doing?

19:45.398 --> 19:46.798
Shame on you.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.499
People are allowed to have

19:48.535 --> 19:50.568
private conversation in this country.

19:50.603 --> 19:52.470
Even your brother believed that.

19:52.505 --> 19:54.139
Get some rest.

19:54.174 --> 19:57.142
You look terrible.

19:58.846 --> 20:01.046
You wanted to see me?

20:01.081 --> 20:03.548
Yes, come on.

20:03.583 --> 20:06.117
(door closes)

20:07.820 --> 20:10.087
I want you to get married.

20:11.557 --> 20:14.859
I'm still in mourning, Sheik.

20:14.894 --> 20:16.460
Enough time has passed.

20:16.495 --> 20:18.762
Uh, not for me.

20:20.032 --> 20:22.632
(sighs) The council needs to know

20:22.668 --> 20:25.402
that you have moved beyond
personal revenge.

20:25.437 --> 20:27.537
Until they sense that,

20:27.573 --> 20:29.473
you will never have their trust.

20:29.508 --> 20:31.842
You don't believe them, do you?

20:31.878 --> 20:34.345
I am not marching an army into Abuddin

20:34.380 --> 20:35.913
to avenge Samira.

20:35.948 --> 20:38.114
You and I, we have a vision.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.583
I think one doesn't preclude the other.

20:40.618 --> 20:42.318
Marry Madiyah.

20:42.354 --> 20:44.120
You like her, no?

20:44.155 --> 20:45.821
(scoffs)

20:45.857 --> 20:47.556
No need to feel shame.

20:47.592 --> 20:49.658
It's good.

20:53.698 --> 20:55.431
Yeah?

20:55.466 --> 20:57.800
(short laugh)

21:01.842 --> 21:05.119
Now, I may be the heir to
my friend Bassam's revolution...

21:05.143 --> 21:06.742
(knocking)

21:06.778 --> 21:09.145
We have a break.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.514
We've been tracking Hanif Kattan,

21:11.549 --> 21:14.884
a student at the university
who was brought in a few weeks ago.

21:14.919 --> 21:16.597
Very outspoken since your
daughter's kidnapping.

21:16.621 --> 21:18.020
He's been in touch

21:18.055 --> 21:19.789
with his sister Madiyah Kattan,

21:19.824 --> 21:22.925
who recently left Asima to
join the Caliphate in Syria.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.587
Yesterday, they talked on
the phone for a while.

21:25.612 --> 21:28.464
Apparently, Madiyah's getting married...

21:28.499 --> 21:30.699
to Ihab bin Rashid.

21:30.735 --> 21:33.368
We tracked her phone.

21:33.404 --> 21:37.039
The exact time and location
of that ceremony is imminent.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.829
Finally.

21:51.002 --> 21:52.701
Hey!

21:52.737 --> 21:56.005
Hey.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.473
WOMAN: Honey?

21:59.244 --> 22:02.411
Um, Sammy, this is my wife Akilah.

22:03.314 --> 22:04.814
Ah, nice to meet you.

22:04.849 --> 22:05.849
Same here.

22:05.884 --> 22:07.083
They met me for lunch.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.684
Oh.

22:08.719 --> 22:12.054
She slept all the way through, hmm?

22:12.090 --> 22:14.056
She's beautiful.

22:14.092 --> 22:17.526
Um, so class was canceled?

22:17.561 --> 22:19.261
Yes, um, I'll be out of town.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.962
We're going to Dubai.

22:20.998 --> 22:22.363
- Dubai?
- Mm-hmm.

22:22.399 --> 22:23.431
Why?

22:23.466 --> 22:25.075
Haitham's interviewing for a job.

22:25.183 --> 22:25.884
Akilah...

22:26.038 --> 22:27.702
AKILAH: Don't be modest.

22:27.737 --> 22:30.138
He's up for a full professorship
at the university there.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.274
That's wonderful.

22:32.309 --> 22:35.110
(chuckles) When would it start?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.189
If he gets it, in two months.

22:36.213 --> 22:37.145
Akilah.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.880
Crazy.

22:38.916 --> 22:40.215
So fast.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.117
Let's not celebrate yet, hmm?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.985
Well, uh...

22:44.021 --> 22:45.720
break a leg.

22:45.755 --> 22:48.156
Thank you. Yes.

22:48.192 --> 22:49.724
Thank you, Sammy.

22:49.759 --> 22:52.527
Professor.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.041
Where were we when the
prayer spaces were closed?

23:07.076 --> 23:08.843
Nowhere.

23:08.878 --> 23:10.410
We said nothing.

23:10.446 --> 23:13.214
Where were we when
Sheik Al-Qadi was barred

23:13.249 --> 23:14.548
from the election? Nowhere.

23:14.583 --> 23:16.717
Again, we said nothing.

23:16.752 --> 23:19.553
What student union
wouldn't speak out against that?

23:19.588 --> 23:20.620
Even in America.

23:20.656 --> 23:24.024
30% of us are Islamists,

23:24.060 --> 23:25.892
but we have no voice here.

23:25.927 --> 23:27.894
Halima Nair's

23:27.929 --> 23:30.629
been hypnotized by her
American-style crush

23:30.665 --> 23:32.798
on our American-style president.

23:32.834 --> 23:34.267
This isn't your meeting, Hanif!

23:34.302 --> 23:35.579
I'm exercising my right to speak.

23:35.603 --> 23:36.669
We start in five minutes.

23:36.704 --> 23:37.904
You can wait your turn.

23:37.939 --> 23:39.272
Turn?

23:39.307 --> 23:40.417
You don't let anyone talk anymore

23:40.441 --> 23:42.108
unless they agree with you.

23:42.143 --> 23:43.576
Just like your hero.

23:43.611 --> 23:45.256
Fine, you want a gripe
session? I'll put you on the agenda.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.813
You can say whatever you want.
I'm sure you have a whole list.

23:51.887 --> 23:55.121
How about the fact you're an
informant for the government?

23:55.156 --> 23:58.691
Turning people into the
police without evidence.

23:58.726 --> 24:00.092
I said you'll have your turn.

24:00.127 --> 24:01.527
We're onto you.

24:01.562 --> 24:04.096
The 30% of us you want
to pretend don't exist.

24:04.131 --> 24:07.099
Just because you choose to
live a certain lifestyle.

24:07.134 --> 24:08.774
Lifestyle... What's
that supposed to mean?

24:08.889 --> 24:09.693
Look at you.

24:09.811 --> 24:10.636
How you dress.

24:10.671 --> 24:13.005
How you parade your body

24:13.040 --> 24:14.206
around men.

24:14.241 --> 24:15.741
Around your boyfriend.

24:15.777 --> 24:17.075
I saw the two of you together.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.990
I saw her with him yesterday afternoon.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.203
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.060
Throwing yourself at him!

24:23.095 --> 24:25.595
In the square! In public!

24:25.631 --> 24:27.097
That's not true!

24:27.133 --> 24:28.710
Besides, we're here to
discuss political issues.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.734
MAN: Whore!

24:30.769 --> 24:31.969
Whore!

24:32.473 --> 24:35.205
- MAN: Whore!
- WOMAN 2: Whore! Whore!

24:35.240 --> 24:38.308
- (crowd murmuring)
- WOMAN 3: Whore! Whore! Whore!

24:39.511 --> 24:41.311
You have the most to
gain from this deal.

24:41.347 --> 24:43.714
My support makes you president.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.349
What do I get? What do you want?

24:45.384 --> 24:46.249
First off,

24:46.284 --> 24:47.684
half the ministerial positions.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.887
You can't afford to walk away
from this any more than I can.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.656
There are 20 ministerial positions.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.224
You can appoint five.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.826
What else?

24:55.861 --> 24:58.428
A two-track legal system.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.129
Agreed.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.265
Observant Muslim may choose

25:02.300 --> 25:04.011
to bring their family
dispute into Sharia court.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.502
No, no choose.

25:05.537 --> 25:06.970
In family disputes, there should be

25:07.005 --> 25:08.505
no other option but the Sharia law.

25:08.540 --> 25:12.575
In criminal cases, we
can have the civil law apply.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.177
Leila Al Fayeed!

25:14.212 --> 25:15.578
Will you hear me out, Nafisa?

25:15.613 --> 25:17.091
- No one will listen to you.
- (slamming dishes)

25:17.115 --> 25:18.948
You think Bassam hates you?

25:18.984 --> 25:21.284
Wait until your followers
hear you say that name.

25:21.319 --> 25:23.319
You will be the first man in history

25:23.355 --> 25:24.988
to convince everyone on every side

25:25.023 --> 25:26.655
that you've betrayed them all

25:26.691 --> 25:27.757
simultaneously.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.058
SAFIYA: <i>He's a Muslim cleric</i>

25:29.094 --> 25:32.028
and a traitor... what
exactly are his good qualities?

25:32.063 --> 25:33.696
What does Kipfer say?

25:33.731 --> 25:36.165
He says I'm going to lose the
election to Fauzi Nidal,

25:36.201 --> 25:37.400
so I sent him home.

25:37.435 --> 25:40.536
This is Abuddinian politics now.

25:40.571 --> 25:43.639
You have gone completely mad.

25:43.674 --> 25:45.073
No, I have not.

25:45.109 --> 25:46.841
I found clarity.

25:46.877 --> 25:48.243
This is right, Safiya.

25:48.279 --> 25:50.178
It's revolutionary, that's
why it scares you.

25:50.214 --> 25:52.247
But I'm telling you, this is the answer.

25:52.283 --> 25:53.815
Trust me.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.817
A coalition...

25:55.852 --> 25:57.752
...that will unite
the people of Abuddin.

25:57.788 --> 25:59.187
Work with the Al Fayeeds?!

25:59.223 --> 26:01.623
She's not an Al Fayeed. She married one.

26:01.658 --> 26:03.058
I think we can trust her.

26:03.093 --> 26:04.559
At least we have to try.

26:04.594 --> 26:05.860
Or else we get nothing.

26:05.896 --> 26:07.129
LEILA: <i>I believe the sheik</i>

26:07.164 --> 26:08.630
is a man of peace.

26:08.665 --> 26:11.633
And we need to
learn to trust one another

26:11.668 --> 26:13.001
before it's too late.

26:13.037 --> 26:15.037
Unlikely bedfellows, yes,

26:15.072 --> 26:17.539
<i>but therein lies our beauty.</i>

26:17.574 --> 26:20.574
This small step is the
way to avoid calamity

26:20.609 --> 26:23.244
so that tomorrow we can
fight back for the true,

26:23.279 --> 26:25.679
fully Islamic state we ultimately want.

26:25.714 --> 26:29.450
In the meantime, there will
be Sharia law in this country

26:29.485 --> 26:32.686
for the first time for
more than 25 years.

26:35.058 --> 26:38.759
Either this or Fauzi Nidal.

26:38.794 --> 26:41.595
Nationalized industries.

26:41.630 --> 26:43.497
Redistribution of wealth.

26:43.532 --> 26:45.466
Some of you look scared.

26:45.501 --> 26:48.069
Well, you should be.

26:48.104 --> 26:49.736
That is a scary thought.

26:49.772 --> 26:50.737
<i>But there is</i>

26:50.773 --> 26:52.372
an alternative to that fear.

26:52.407 --> 26:53.740
This coalition.

26:53.776 --> 26:55.809
And with your support,

26:55.845 --> 26:59.880
this election is ours for the taking.

26:59.915 --> 27:02.483
(man singing loudly in Arabic)

27:03.819 --> 27:07.521
(other men join in singing)

27:08.824 --> 27:11.324
(man singing)

27:13.562 --> 27:16.062
(other men singing)

27:18.200 --> 27:21.735
(man singing)

27:23.572 --> 27:26.206
(other men singing)

27:26.241 --> 27:29.009
(men whooping)

27:29.044 --> 27:31.244
(man singing)

27:32.881 --> 27:35.415
(other men singing)

27:37.752 --> 27:40.186
(man singing)

27:42.924 --> 27:45.458
(other men singing)

27:50.899 --> 27:54.234
Let's sign this paper and
make you a married man.

28:04.478 --> 28:06.913
- What's wrong?
- (pen clicks)

28:06.948 --> 28:09.549
Pen's dry.

28:09.584 --> 28:11.951
(men laughing)

28:11.986 --> 28:14.353
Wait right there, hmm.

28:26.834 --> 28:29.301
(explosion)

28:36.544 --> 28:38.710
(distorted sounds of men screaming)

28:38.745 --> 28:40.312
(high-pitching ringing)

28:40.347 --> 28:42.514
(distorted screaming)

28:46.787 --> 28:49.288
(high-pitching ringing)

28:51.992 --> 28:54.226
(indistinct, muffled shouting)

29:00.033 --> 29:02.067
(muffled shouting continues)

29:02.103 --> 29:04.335
(shouting): Sheik!

29:06.372 --> 29:08.406
(shouting) Sheik!

29:14.748 --> 29:16.781
(people screaming)

29:18.919 --> 29:20.752
Sheik! Sheik!

29:27.260 --> 29:31.863
I will see you in
paradise, my brother, hmm?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.333
What if...

29:35.368 --> 29:37.135
what if we're wrong?

29:37.170 --> 29:40.638
What if...

29:40.673 --> 29:41.805
if it's not true?

29:41.841 --> 29:43.040
Shh.

29:43.075 --> 29:45.843
Of course it's true.

29:45.878 --> 29:47.277
Of course it is.

29:47.312 --> 29:49.013
You are lucky.

29:49.048 --> 29:51.448
You are blessed.

29:52.317 --> 29:55.719
Paradise awaits you.

29:57.857 --> 30:00.290
(men continue shouting)

30:14.797 --> 30:15.877
He's dead?

30:16.037 --> 30:17.193
Yes.

30:17.228 --> 30:19.195
But not Ihab?

30:19.230 --> 30:22.064
I don't think so, no.

30:22.899 --> 30:24.765
They're preparing to bury the sheik.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.600
If Ihab were dead, we'd know it.

30:26.635 --> 30:30.237
I need Ihab.

30:31.840 --> 30:35.508
Mr. President, this is a win.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.844
You need to know that.

30:44.186 --> 30:46.219
All right.

30:49.124 --> 30:51.457
I don't understand why
you're doing this.

30:51.493 --> 30:52.625
Shut the door.

30:52.660 --> 30:53.626
Are you running away?

30:53.661 --> 30:54.827
Is that what you're doing?

30:54.863 --> 30:55.795
HAITHAM: That's right.

30:55.830 --> 30:57.264
I can't stay here anymore.

30:57.299 --> 30:59.832
It's too dangerous.

31:00.598 --> 31:03.432
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, huh?

31:03.467 --> 31:04.645
Because you've only been in Abuddin

31:04.669 --> 31:05.646
for your father's honeymoon.

31:05.670 --> 31:07.402
Well, the honeymoon is over.

31:07.438 --> 31:08.837
I-I don't know what that means.

31:08.872 --> 31:12.541
That means this
country is about to remember

31:12.576 --> 31:16.411
its worst self again.

31:16.447 --> 31:19.448
It's when people like me would...

31:21.018 --> 31:23.752
They come for us in the middle
of the night and we disappear.

31:23.787 --> 31:25.064
That's not gonna happen.
I know my father.

31:25.089 --> 31:26.070
- Have you not been
- No, no, no.

31:26.095 --> 31:26.883
- listening to him?!
- You knew...

31:26.908 --> 31:30.659
you knew him before
he sat in that chair.

31:30.694 --> 31:33.128
The office changes everything.

31:33.164 --> 31:34.307
I let my guard down with you.

31:34.331 --> 31:35.864
I'm not going to do that again.

31:35.899 --> 31:37.566
Fine, leave.

31:37.601 --> 31:40.101
I'm not gonna make you
stay, but-but the Emirates?!

31:41.238 --> 31:42.215
Why don't you go to a place

31:42.239 --> 31:43.183
where you can be who you are?

31:43.207 --> 31:45.439
Who I am? Hey!

31:47.009 --> 31:48.075
Who am I? Hmm?

31:48.110 --> 31:49.009
You're a gay man.

31:49.045 --> 31:50.545
(door slams shut)

31:50.580 --> 31:52.647
You don't know me at all.

31:52.682 --> 31:53.914
I know you slept with me.

31:53.949 --> 31:55.683
As if that defines who I am.

31:56.986 --> 32:00.354
I'm not homosexual, Sammy.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.492
I may sleep with men once in a while,

32:04.527 --> 32:07.528
but don't you dare assume that
makes me something I'm not.

32:09.965 --> 32:11.098
That is...

32:11.133 --> 32:12.900
(chuckles)

32:12.935 --> 32:16.970
That is so American of
you to think that way.

32:18.575 --> 32:21.308
I'm not like you...

32:21.343 --> 32:24.143
or your, um... your other friends.

32:24.179 --> 32:27.013
I thought you understood that.

32:27.882 --> 32:30.917
I thought that was what drew you to me.

32:30.952 --> 32:33.853
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have papers to grade, huh.

32:33.888 --> 32:36.256
So, if you need a minute to collect
yourself I understand,

32:36.291 --> 32:38.191
(snaps fingers) otherwise, please go.

32:38.227 --> 32:39.926
And stop crying.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.399
You know if I'd been there,

32:46.435 --> 32:49.902
I would have punched his lights out.

32:49.938 --> 32:51.738
Hey.

32:57.378 --> 33:00.046
(whispering): Hey. Huh?

33:03.651 --> 33:05.151
What are you doing?

33:05.186 --> 33:06.163
I'm just trying to kiss you.

33:06.187 --> 33:07.153
Now?

33:07.188 --> 33:08.554
He just...

33:08.589 --> 33:10.356
they just called me a whore.

33:10.391 --> 33:12.658
But you're not a whore.

33:12.693 --> 33:14.438
Just because those
assholes are stuck somewhere

33:14.462 --> 33:15.494
in the middle ages, what,

33:15.529 --> 33:17.830
I'm not allowed to kiss you?

33:17.866 --> 33:19.565
What? Huh?

33:19.600 --> 33:20.833
Does this change something?

33:20.869 --> 33:22.179
How does this
change anything between us?

33:22.203 --> 33:23.168
I can't...

33:23.203 --> 33:25.003
win every fight at once.

33:25.038 --> 33:26.605
What does that even mean?

33:26.641 --> 33:27.606
I don't... I...

33:27.642 --> 33:29.308
I can't give him an argument.

33:29.343 --> 33:33.111
"That slut... she wants women
to be treated the same as men.

33:33.147 --> 33:34.380
That slut wants democracy.

33:34.415 --> 33:35.381
Western values."

33:35.416 --> 33:36.382
What are Western values?

33:36.417 --> 33:37.783
Sex.

33:37.818 --> 33:39.851
Depravity.

33:41.489 --> 33:42.454
That's crazy.

33:42.490 --> 33:43.490
You know, that's...

33:43.524 --> 33:45.157
that is giving him all the power.

33:45.192 --> 33:47.159
I'm a woman! He has all the power!

33:47.194 --> 33:48.627
Yeah, but he's-he's lying, anyway.

33:48.663 --> 33:50.703
He's calling you a whore whether
you are one or not.

33:50.731 --> 33:51.830
So what?

33:51.865 --> 33:54.065
Just have sex, no one will know.

33:55.502 --> 33:57.836
I will know.

34:01.408 --> 34:03.809
Unbelievable.

34:05.578 --> 34:09.580
I love you and I
want to make love to you.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.152
Me, too.

34:14.188 --> 34:16.487
Me, too...

34:17.489 --> 34:19.024
...but it can wait.

34:20.760 --> 34:24.830
Those other things that I
want can't wait until I'm married.

34:30.804 --> 34:31.902
Hey.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.237
Hey.

34:34.273 --> 34:37.141
No.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.610
Don't leave me because of this.

34:42.349 --> 34:44.581
I need you.

34:55.027 --> 34:57.428
COGSWELL: Remember me?

34:57.464 --> 35:00.565
The guy you were taking pictures of.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.166
Where's the computer?

35:02.201 --> 35:03.401
What pictures?

35:03.436 --> 35:05.236
Do I have to ask you twice?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.671
Y-you've got it all wrong.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.106
You think you can do this to me,

35:10.141 --> 35:13.410
when I've spent 30
years building a reputation?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.311
You think you can do this to her?

35:15.347 --> 35:17.481
Where's the computer?

35:17.516 --> 35:18.526
I don't know what you mean.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.250
Bullshit!

35:20.285 --> 35:22.285
Pictures live forever today.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.487
Now give me the computer.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.721
Let's go!

35:28.494 --> 35:30.527
Open it.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.532
(whispering): Shit.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.233
Shit.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.435
The-the battery's dead.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.236
What is this, some kind of a joke?

35:40.272 --> 35:41.905
Uh, I-I can't.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.274
- I-I can't.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

36:12.988 --> 36:15.388
Where were you?

36:19.462 --> 36:20.694
Been here for an hour.

36:20.730 --> 36:22.929
You didn't answer your phone.

36:25.701 --> 36:26.701
Wine?

36:26.736 --> 36:29.035
You look like you could use some.

36:33.509 --> 36:35.309
It's Quintarelli.

36:35.344 --> 36:38.078
Yeah, well, it's all grape juice to me.

36:50.024 --> 36:52.224
You missed your window.

36:52.260 --> 36:53.593
I have to go.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.396
Watch your television tonight.

36:56.431 --> 36:58.398
Why? What have you got up your sleeve?

36:58.433 --> 37:00.700
You advise the government.

37:00.735 --> 37:02.802
You know I can't talk to you about that.

37:06.341 --> 37:07.973
(sighs)

37:19.152 --> 37:20.985
I'm Nafisa Al-Qadi.

37:21.021 --> 37:23.154
Pleasure to meet you.

37:23.190 --> 37:25.490
This is my sister, Safiya.

37:25.526 --> 37:28.727
You and I should, uh, spend
some time together.

37:28.762 --> 37:30.662
Get to know each other.

37:31.765 --> 37:34.132
You're supposed to
say, "That will be nice."

37:34.167 --> 37:37.001
I prefer honest to polite.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.236
I believe you're using

37:38.271 --> 37:40.038
my husband.

37:40.073 --> 37:42.641
We're using each other.

37:42.676 --> 37:44.843
Given the history of
my people and yours,

37:44.878 --> 37:46.778
it's not as neat as you make it sound.

37:46.814 --> 37:48.880
History's about to change,

37:48.915 --> 37:51.716
but I appreciate a woman
who supports her husband.

37:51.751 --> 37:53.885
Like you did, Mrs. Al Fayeed?

37:55.222 --> 37:57.388
It's time, madam.

37:57.423 --> 37:59.490
(quietly): Thank you.

38:02.896 --> 38:04.863
<i>For generations</i>

38:04.898 --> 38:07.165
the secular and the religious

38:07.200 --> 38:12.103
have lived separate
existences in our country.

38:12.138 --> 38:15.406
Today we know

38:15.441 --> 38:18.943
that is no longer possible...

38:18.979 --> 38:23.213
if our nation is
going to have a real future.

38:23.249 --> 38:25.115
And so, today,

38:25.150 --> 38:26.450
I stand here,

38:26.486 --> 38:29.186
proud...

38:29.221 --> 38:32.256
to announce a coalition

38:32.291 --> 38:34.658
that will finally unite

38:34.694 --> 38:36.560
all of our people.

38:36.596 --> 38:40.130
A coalition of harmony.

38:40.165 --> 38:42.833
A coalition for peace.

38:52.111 --> 38:54.678
BARRY: <i>I don't know what it
is you think you're doing.</i>

38:54.714 --> 38:55.913
Please, you're just upset

38:55.948 --> 38:57.214
your guy isn't going to win.

38:59.719 --> 39:02.152
I banned that man from office,

39:02.187 --> 39:03.887
and you defied me.

39:03.923 --> 39:05.700
I'm not having this conversation
with you again.

39:05.724 --> 39:07.068
Is it just that you need to hurt me?

39:07.092 --> 39:07.824
Is that it?

39:07.859 --> 39:09.626
You still hate me that much?

39:09.661 --> 39:10.794
You can't really think that.

39:10.829 --> 39:12.529
Tell me how else I should interpret it.

39:12.564 --> 39:14.331
I never want to hurt you.

39:14.366 --> 39:16.133
- Never.
- Bullshit.

39:16.168 --> 39:18.101
You're lying.

39:18.137 --> 39:20.570
You're always lying.

39:20.605 --> 39:22.306
I'm not. I'm not lying.

39:22.341 --> 39:23.773
I'm not trying to betray you.

39:23.809 --> 39:25.708
I'm not your enemy.

39:25.744 --> 39:27.710
I just disagree with you.

39:27.746 --> 39:30.613
Not everyone who
disagrees with you is a traitor.

39:30.649 --> 39:34.418
He embraced my daughter's murderer,

39:34.453 --> 39:38.088
and you made him a partner.

39:38.123 --> 39:40.790
(short laugh)

39:42.094 --> 39:43.593
Get out.

39:43.628 --> 39:46.796
I never want to see your face again.

39:49.601 --> 39:52.368
Get out.

39:52.403 --> 39:53.870
No, you can't do that.

39:53.905 --> 39:57.774
You may be angry, but you
can't walk away from me.

39:58.810 --> 40:00.877
We're connected, you and I.

40:00.912 --> 40:02.912
(scoffs) That was a long time ago.

40:02.948 --> 40:04.681
- Not that.
- And Jamal is dead.

40:04.716 --> 40:06.483
Not that, either.

40:06.518 --> 40:09.786
What the hell are you talking about?

40:10.755 --> 40:12.421
Our child.

40:13.257 --> 40:14.257
Our son.

40:15.193 --> 40:17.626
Don't tell me you never suspected.

40:17.661 --> 40:21.463
The weekend before my wedding.

40:21.499 --> 40:23.164
Don't tell me you don't remember.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.669
I held onto it for so many years.

40:27.705 --> 40:30.873
I wanted to tell you desperately.

40:30.908 --> 40:34.209
When you came back for Ahmed's wedding.

40:34.244 --> 40:36.745
I wanted to tell you it was your son

40:36.780 --> 40:38.446
who was about to exchange vows.

40:38.482 --> 40:40.048
But for Ahmed's sake,

40:40.083 --> 40:42.450
I had to protect him from your brother.

40:42.486 --> 40:44.753
So there was no way I could.

40:44.788 --> 40:47.122
You would've done the same.

40:47.157 --> 40:48.857
We may disagree,

40:48.893 --> 40:52.292
we may never see eye to
eye politically ever again,

40:52.328 --> 40:54.428
but we're connected.

40:56.533 --> 40:58.766
It's all legacy.

40:58.801 --> 41:01.636
A legacy of love.

41:01.671 --> 41:04.872
Mine, at least.

41:07.043 --> 41:09.777
- (bangs on door)
- Open the door.

41:14.316 --> 41:17.823
(sighs)

41:26.433 --> 41:27.711
Apparently, there's polling

41:27.735 --> 41:29.401
that comes out later today that was done

41:29.436 --> 41:31.870
after our announcement last night.

41:33.307 --> 41:35.874
We'll see where we are.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.343
What's wrong?

41:38.378 --> 41:39.477
The kid who took

41:39.513 --> 41:41.680
those pictures of you?

41:41.716 --> 41:42.981
He was found dead.

41:43.017 --> 41:45.317
Police said robbery gone wrong...

41:45.352 --> 41:48.353
but that isn't
really what happened, is it?

41:48.388 --> 41:50.689
What are you suggesting?

41:50.725 --> 41:51.623
You tell me.

41:51.658 --> 41:53.692
I had nothing to do with it.

41:53.728 --> 41:55.293
I don't even know who that kid was.

41:55.329 --> 41:56.460
Your general then.

41:56.495 --> 41:57.773
Did you tell him about the pictures?

41:57.797 --> 41:59.063
Of course I did.

41:59.099 --> 41:59.831
So, it was him.

41:59.866 --> 42:01.899
I have no idea.

42:01.935 --> 42:03.701
Of course it was.

42:05.638 --> 42:08.505
If it was him...

42:08.541 --> 42:10.241
it was to protect me...

42:10.276 --> 42:13.277
you... us.

42:13.312 --> 42:15.646
- (slams down cup)
- Stop looking at me that way.

42:15.681 --> 42:16.759
Some people get what they deserve.

42:16.783 --> 42:18.983
He didn't deserve it.

42:19.018 --> 42:20.684
He wasn't a blackmailer.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.053
What are you talking about?

42:22.088 --> 42:24.889
I paid him to take those pictures.

42:25.725 --> 42:27.158
I don't understand.

42:27.193 --> 42:29.861
He was just a kid who worked for me.

42:29.896 --> 42:32.563
I gave him a few hundred
bucks just to scare

42:32.598 --> 42:34.998
some sense into you.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.440
Well, that was stupid, wasn't it?

42:43.476 --> 42:44.575
Who are you people?

42:44.610 --> 42:45.643
"You people"?

42:45.678 --> 42:46.977
Isn't there any limit

42:47.012 --> 42:48.457
to what you'll do to get what you want?

42:48.481 --> 42:50.247
No, this was your doing...

42:50.283 --> 42:51.348
not mine,

42:51.384 --> 42:52.149
not William's.

42:52.184 --> 42:55.352
He killed someone for no reason.

42:55.388 --> 42:57.821
Even if he was a blackmailer,

42:57.856 --> 43:00.023
I had paid him off.

43:01.627 --> 43:03.527
You need to pull yourself together.

43:03.562 --> 43:05.829
Everything is about to change for us,

43:05.864 --> 43:07.130
for all of us.

43:07.166 --> 43:09.299
I'm not going to put
that at risk because of some

43:09.334 --> 43:10.533
mistake you made.

43:10.568 --> 43:12.936
This stays between us.

43:13.872 --> 43:16.006
Between us.

43:16.041 --> 43:18.208
Or what? He kills me, too?

43:18.243 --> 43:20.443
You need to pull yourself together!

43:26.751 --> 43:27.951
Right.

43:27.986 --> 43:29.886
COGSWELL: It was an accident.

43:29.922 --> 43:32.455
I did what I had to do...

43:32.490 --> 43:35.425
to protect us, to protect you.

43:35.460 --> 43:38.528
I'm not used to being
taken care of that way.

43:39.897 --> 43:41.497
You make me feel safe.

43:41.533 --> 43:43.299
(chuckles)

43:43.335 --> 43:47.704
Well, you are many
things, Leila Al Fayeed,

43:47.739 --> 43:50.272
but safe is not one of them.

43:52.610 --> 43:54.944
Are you near a TV?

43:54.979 --> 43:57.847
(children laughing nearby)

43:57.882 --> 44:00.583
Nafisa, where's the remote?

44:01.653 --> 44:02.819
Nafisa!

44:02.854 --> 44:04.286
I'm in the refrigerator.

44:04.322 --> 44:06.055
Find it yourself.

44:08.460 --> 44:10.159
NEWSWOMAN: The latest polls in the race

44:10.194 --> 44:13.028
for president of Abuddin signified
a major change today

44:13.064 --> 44:14.308
- in the political landscape.
- You'll never catch me.

44:14.332 --> 44:15.497
I will, I will.

44:15.532 --> 44:16.966
- Quiet!
- Just one day after

44:17.001 --> 44:18.045
her announcement of a coalition

44:18.069 --> 44:19.468
with the Freedom Party

44:19.503 --> 44:20.569
of Sheik Al-Qadi,

44:20.604 --> 44:23.305
Leila Al Fayeed has pulled ahead

44:23.341 --> 44:24.974
of Fauzi Nidal,

44:25.009 --> 44:27.176
with 51% to 45%

44:27.211 --> 44:29.778
and 4% yet to be decided.

44:29.813 --> 44:31.914
Did you hear that?

44:31.949 --> 44:33.575
Did you hear that?

44:33.728 --> 44:34.962
What are you talking about?

44:34.986 --> 44:36.318
It looks like your father

44:36.354 --> 44:38.921
is going to be prime
minister of Abuddin.

44:38.956 --> 44:41.290
You see what you've done?!

44:41.325 --> 44:43.792
You've joined our enemies together.

44:43.827 --> 44:45.527
- Fauzi.
- Tell him!

44:45.562 --> 44:47.028
What are you doing here, anyway?

44:47.063 --> 44:49.230
I was delivering a Commission report.

44:49.266 --> 44:51.566
- Is that a problem?
- This is a disaster, Bassam.

44:51.602 --> 44:52.634
It's a disaster!

44:52.669 --> 44:53.702
It won't stick, Fauzi.

44:53.737 --> 44:55.069
What are the chances of them

44:55.105 --> 44:56.738
holding a coalition like this together?

44:56.774 --> 44:58.117
For two months until the election?

44:58.141 --> 44:59.708
Pretty good, I'd say.

44:59.743 --> 45:01.175
And if she gets to be president,

45:01.211 --> 45:02.744
you've amputated your own revolution.

45:02.780 --> 45:04.245
Fauzi, it's just one poll.

45:04.281 --> 45:05.792
They probably got a
bounce off the announcement.

45:05.816 --> 45:07.816
Look, let's not panic.

45:07.851 --> 45:09.028
All right? There's
still a long way to go.

45:09.052 --> 45:10.118
You just couldn't leave

45:10.153 --> 45:11.820
well enough alone, could you?

45:11.855 --> 45:13.354
You had to ban Al-Qadi.

45:13.390 --> 45:16.224
You are no different from your brother.

45:18.661 --> 45:23.331
Unless you have something
else to say, we're busy here.

45:35.711 --> 45:37.545
Don't say it.

45:38.982 --> 45:41.049
You need someone on your side.

45:42.419 --> 45:44.518
I'll be on your side.

45:52.562 --> 45:54.762
God has sent me a message.

45:54.797 --> 45:58.131
In some sense I always knew,

45:58.167 --> 46:03.070
but I let myself... be convinced.

46:03.940 --> 46:05.473
That was my mistake.

46:09.579 --> 46:11.879
My path is revenge.

46:11.914 --> 46:14.247
Nothing else.

46:15.050 --> 46:17.117
I understand.

46:28.416 --> 46:29.957
IHAB: <i>What is going on</i>

46:29.982 --> 46:32.723
in Abuddin makes it
even more important for us

46:32.748 --> 46:34.886
to put the pressure on.

46:34.921 --> 46:36.380
This American

46:36.405 --> 46:37.767
is not going to be president forever,

46:37.791 --> 46:39.924
and before he steps aside,

46:39.960 --> 46:42.816
we need to encourage him to
make a war he's going to regret.

46:42.841 --> 46:44.917
Your plan for Al-Qadi backfired.

46:45.069 --> 46:47.183
Instead of making the
American more powerful,

46:47.208 --> 46:49.168
it created an alliance against him.

46:49.193 --> 46:50.969
Now you want us to rush into war

46:51.005 --> 46:53.223
because you see your
window of opportunity closing?

46:53.248 --> 46:55.007
The sheik chose Ihab,

46:55.042 --> 46:56.441
loud and clear.

46:56.477 --> 46:58.446
If he were alive,
I know what side he'd be on.

46:58.471 --> 46:59.785
We all do.

46:59.810 --> 47:02.441
- I stand with the sheik.
- The sheik's dead! Look at the facts.

47:02.466 --> 47:04.058
It's our decision now.

47:04.083 --> 47:05.217
Who's with me?

47:19.365 --> 47:21.465
(exhales)

47:21.501 --> 47:24.035
Now, where were we?

47:24.070 --> 47:26.570
MALOOF: But we will not be deterred.

47:26.605 --> 47:29.340
We will continue this fight,

47:29.375 --> 47:33.461
even into their own territory
until we eliminate this threat

47:33.486 --> 47:35.446
to our way of life.

47:35.481 --> 47:37.281
(turns off TV)

47:37.316 --> 47:39.198
Have you seen the latest polls?

47:39.223 --> 47:40.479
Yeah, I've seen them.

47:40.504 --> 47:44.031
It makes things complicated, the polls.

47:45.115 --> 47:47.435
The army's not inclined
to support anyone,

47:47.460 --> 47:49.894
just because they
happen to win the election.

47:51.063 --> 47:53.029
Really?

47:54.866 --> 47:56.433
Well...

47:57.542 --> 47:58.673
I don't think you're quite

47:58.698 --> 48:00.589
getting the hang of democracy, General.

48:00.614 --> 48:01.981
(scoffs)

48:03.849 --> 48:05.014
You may be right.

48:05.039 --> 48:06.104
A military coup?

48:06.129 --> 48:07.396
The army was never going

48:07.421 --> 48:08.568
to allow Leila Al Fayeed

48:08.593 --> 48:10.493
to succeed her husband.

48:10.715 --> 48:12.484
Just so you know.

48:12.751 --> 48:14.251
Yeah.

48:14.286 --> 48:15.718
Well, let me tell you what happens

48:15.754 --> 48:18.354
when you decide to exercise veto power

48:18.390 --> 48:20.122
over the will of the people,

48:20.157 --> 48:22.425
the American military goes home,

48:22.460 --> 48:23.970
and with it all of its equipment,

48:23.995 --> 48:25.561
all of its spare parts

48:25.597 --> 48:27.930
and all of its intelligence capabilities.

48:27.965 --> 48:31.534
So, then what kind of army would
you have in six months?

48:31.569 --> 48:34.136
Oh, I'm shocked, General.

48:34.171 --> 48:36.406
I thought we were allies.

48:37.241 --> 48:39.442
Oh, please.

48:46.918 --> 48:48.217
(knocking on door)

48:48.252 --> 48:49.754
Yes?

48:51.935 --> 48:54.044
I-I'm sorry. It's-it's
too late, we'll...

48:54.069 --> 48:55.336
It's okay.

48:59.029 --> 49:00.529
I was just...

49:01.632 --> 49:03.532
I wanted to see how you are.

49:03.567 --> 49:04.999
I saw the polls.

49:05.026 --> 49:06.523
I realize my mother's made things...

49:06.557 --> 49:07.989
I know.

49:12.075 --> 49:13.808
What?

49:13.833 --> 49:14.965
I know.

49:14.990 --> 49:16.490
She told me.

49:19.182 --> 49:21.316
I'm happy about it.

49:21.351 --> 49:23.452
I hope you are.

49:26.221 --> 49:28.556
I'm trying to process it.

49:29.358 --> 49:31.224
What it means.

49:31.260 --> 49:33.594
How much I've missed.

49:34.502 --> 49:36.602
How to tell everyone else in my life.

49:36.627 --> 49:38.293
Right.

49:38.318 --> 49:40.218
I know.

49:40.368 --> 49:42.133
And if it's too much, too late, I...

49:42.158 --> 49:44.792
No.

49:48.210 --> 49:49.777
You're my son.

50:03.558 --> 50:06.058
(knocking on door)

50:06.094 --> 50:07.712
Mr. President?

50:07.737 --> 50:08.798
A video...

50:08.823 --> 50:10.440
from Ihab bin Rashid.

50:10.465 --> 50:13.743
The President of Abuddin and
his American bombs have murdered

50:13.768 --> 50:17.871
Sheik Abdullah, leaving me
the leader of the Caliphate.

50:17.906 --> 50:21.040
For the first time since
Bassam Al Fayeed and I

50:21.075 --> 50:24.711
opposed each other,
we both have an army.

50:26.815 --> 50:30.383
In the name of the Prophet, Bassam,

50:30.418 --> 50:33.685
let's finish this once and for all.

50:39.459 --> 50:42.127
I'm going to war...

50:43.497 --> 50:44.993
...to avenge your death.

50:49.327 --> 50:51.509
You need to go now, honey.

50:51.896 --> 50:53.298
I need to sleep.

50:56.009 --> 50:57.500
Let me sleep.

51:05.848 --> 51:10.848
