"Roses are red...

00:07.195 --> 00:08.864
Violets are blue...

00:10.824 --> 00:13.159
This assignment sucks...

00:13.618 --> 00:15.829
and Tristan also sucks."

00:16.538 --> 00:18.374
You know, if you wanted to
be class president so bad,

00:18.457 --> 00:20.792
- you just shouldn't have cheated.
- Just drop it already.

00:20.876 --> 00:23.390
All right, all right. Everyone just chill.

00:23.629 --> 00:25.296
Uh, yeah, you're gonna redo that...

00:25.381 --> 00:27.090
and I want it done tomorrow.

00:27.173 --> 00:28.216
What? Why?

00:28.299 --> 00:29.718
I asked you to write about
somethin' you care about,

00:29.801 --> 00:32.012
not picking fights with your classmates.

00:36.182 --> 00:38.560
Hey, let's get to the caf before
all the good slices are gone.

00:38.644 --> 00:40.687
Floating in the pool with
a glass of single malt

00:40.771 --> 00:42.398
is more what I had in mind. You in?

00:42.481 --> 00:45.066
Uh, I'm not skipping. It's
the second week of school.

00:45.150 --> 00:46.443
Hmm, your loss.

01:01.542 --> 01:02.668
Mom?

01:16.222 --> 01:18.349
Oh!

01:55.515 --> 01:56.722
What are you talking about?

01:56.805 --> 01:58.139
Scandal should totally
be your favorite show.

01:58.223 --> 02:00.851
The computer stuff is
completely unbelievable.

02:00.934 --> 02:03.353
But there's so much
torture. You love torture.

02:03.437 --> 02:07.816
What will your life be like in 15 years?

02:07.899 --> 02:10.693
That's what I want you to show
me in your first assignment.

02:10.776 --> 02:12.320
In groups of two, you're going to use

02:12.403 --> 02:14.114
the animation skills you've been learning

02:14.197 --> 02:17.325
to create a short video about what
you think your future looks like.

02:17.408 --> 02:19.244
Pair up!

02:19.327 --> 02:22.498
Wonder who Maya and Zig are working with.

02:22.581 --> 02:23.832
I think they have seizures

02:23.915 --> 02:25.626
if they're more than
five feet from each other.

02:28.253 --> 02:32.674
So, uh... did you maybe
wanna be my partner for this?

02:32.758 --> 02:34.257
Of course, dummy!

02:34.347 --> 02:36.058
I'll, uh, go grab a handout.

02:36.512 --> 02:38.346
That'll be fun.

02:40.431 --> 02:44.060
So, how's that whole "just being
friends" thing working out for you?

02:44.144 --> 02:45.353
Fine, why?

02:45.436 --> 02:47.898
"Oh, Grace, please be my partner.

02:47.981 --> 02:49.482
I simply can't live without you."

02:49.566 --> 02:51.527
Give it up. You love her.

02:51.610 --> 02:54.530
A little louder please. I don't
think the people in the back heard.

02:54.613 --> 02:56.573
Life's better out of the closet, Zo.

02:56.657 --> 02:59.660
- I don't even know if I'm gay.
- Right.

02:59.743 --> 03:01.578
I'm totally fine with just being friends.

03:01.662 --> 03:04.247
Besides, friendship is
basically dating, without...

03:04.330 --> 03:05.791
The good parts?

03:05.874 --> 03:07.834
You need to make your feelings known.

03:07.918 --> 03:09.545
And if she's not into girls, then sayonara.

03:10.503 --> 03:13.006
Look at her. That hair,

03:13.089 --> 03:15.466
those piercings...

03:15.551 --> 03:17.302
There is no way she's
doing that to attract boys.

03:17.385 --> 03:18.970
Shut up, please.

03:21.807 --> 03:25.686
Okay... I'll watch Scandal
if you watch Battlestar.

03:25.769 --> 03:27.688
Deal?

03:27.771 --> 03:29.898
Deal.

03:33.401 --> 03:34.402
Don't worry, I'll help you.

03:34.485 --> 03:36.446
- We'll just like, tutor, hang out.
- You sure?

03:36.530 --> 03:38.239
Yeah, it's like hanging out, except we...

03:38.323 --> 03:39.324
Oh...

03:41.451 --> 03:42.994
So, what do you think?

03:43.078 --> 03:47.207
Uh... it's so... different.

03:47.290 --> 03:49.543
- What's wrong with you?
- What do you mean what's wrong with me?

03:49.626 --> 03:51.878
Changing your hair is a cry
for help. Everyone knows that.

03:51.962 --> 03:54.840
And you've been different
since Winston broke up with you.

03:54.923 --> 03:57.843
- I just wanted a new look for this year.
- Are you sure?

03:57.926 --> 03:59.678
Because you've been really sad.

03:59.761 --> 04:00.804
I'm fine.

04:02.013 --> 04:04.683
Why don't we go out tonight?
Maybe you'll meet a cute boy.

04:05.559 --> 04:08.394
- I've got hats you can borrow.
- Thanks.

04:08.478 --> 04:10.271
I've already got other plans.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.821
So, how were they doing it?

04:17.904 --> 04:20.115
I already told you. I
couldn't see the dude's face.

04:20.197 --> 04:21.658
What does that even mean?

04:21.742 --> 04:23.952
- Were they like...
- No! Stop.

04:24.035 --> 04:26.747
I'm not gonna recount the
details of walking in on my mom...

04:26.830 --> 04:27.831
doing that.

04:27.914 --> 04:31.334
Hey, at least this means your mom's
not getting back together with your...

04:31.417 --> 04:33.128
lousy dad.

04:33.211 --> 04:34.545
You can say "abusive." He's earned it.

04:34.630 --> 04:35.797
Seriously.

04:35.881 --> 04:37.507
After everything he's put
our family through, like...

04:37.591 --> 04:38.925
I couldn't handle that.

04:39.009 --> 04:42.262
So, maybe there's a silver lining
to walking in on your mom getting...

04:42.345 --> 04:45.015
No! I think I have PTSD.

04:45.098 --> 04:46.432
I want to murder that
random my mom was with.

04:46.516 --> 04:47.601
Reasonable.

04:47.684 --> 04:49.185
I think that cutting the brakes on his car

04:49.269 --> 04:50.687
might really help me heal from this trauma.

04:50.771 --> 04:52.648
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Or maybe decapitation?

04:52.731 --> 04:55.025
I have some antique swords
kicking around the house.

04:55.108 --> 04:56.526
Well, there you go.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.695
I've also heard that bathing
in the blood of your enemies

04:58.779 --> 05:00.488
- is very therapeutic.
- Hmm.

05:03.909 --> 05:05.827
Your turn for institutionalized torture.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.206
So, are you gonna tell
your brother and sister?

05:10.290 --> 05:11.499
Nah, if my mom is having a fling,

05:11.582 --> 05:13.001
Frankie and Hunter don't need to know.

05:13.084 --> 05:15.754
I'm just gonna forget what
I saw. Or, you know... murder.

05:18.715 --> 05:20.801
What color do you think
your hair'll be in 15 years?

05:20.884 --> 05:24.095
- No clue.
- What about those piercings?

05:24.179 --> 05:26.807
Do you think they'll be all
stretched out and weird-looking?

05:36.733 --> 05:38.401
You okay?

05:40.153 --> 05:41.654
Whoa, what'd you do?

05:41.738 --> 05:44.365
I just made a dumb joke
about her piercings.

05:44.449 --> 05:46.910
- Uh-oh.
- What "uh-oh"?

05:46.993 --> 05:49.287
Well, you just don't want
to get on Grace's bad side.

05:49.370 --> 05:51.206
What are you talking
about? She's just a weirdo.

05:51.289 --> 05:53.124
I spilled soda near her laptop once

05:53.208 --> 05:55.210
and she didn't talk to
me for like, three weeks.

05:55.293 --> 05:59.672
Nah, Grace is always going
AWOL for no reason. Just chill.

06:02.425 --> 06:04.552
Okay, that is not chilling.

06:04.635 --> 06:07.388
I'm just texting her. Maybe
it wasn't about what I said.

06:15.063 --> 06:16.231
Who wants breast?

06:16.314 --> 06:17.733
It's very juicy.

06:17.816 --> 06:19.650
I'm gonna eat in my room.

06:19.735 --> 06:21.945
- Me, too.
- Sit down...

06:22.028 --> 06:23.363
both of you.

06:23.446 --> 06:25.365
We are going to have

06:25.448 --> 06:28.827
a nice meal together and we're
gonna talk about our days.

06:32.956 --> 06:34.457
So...

06:35.792 --> 06:37.293
what'd everyone do at school?

06:41.714 --> 06:43.133
I don't know why you're in such sour moods.

06:43.216 --> 06:46.011
I had a great day. I
tried a new Zumba class.

06:46.094 --> 06:47.595
- I feel very invigorated.
- Why don't we talk

06:47.678 --> 06:49.264
about Frankie's midlife-crisis hair?

06:49.347 --> 06:50.515
Why don't you shove it?

06:50.598 --> 06:52.851
Ugh, so much for a nice family dinner.

06:56.062 --> 06:58.148
Dude, what's your problem? Your
weirdo stat's been up today.

07:00.358 --> 07:02.360
Look, well, this morning, I... I kinda...

07:02.443 --> 07:04.320
That was the school. Uh...

07:04.404 --> 07:06.740
They want us to come and talk
to Principal Simpson tomorrow.

07:06.823 --> 07:09.659
- What'd you do now, idiot?
- For once, I have no idea.

07:09.743 --> 07:11.661
Apparently you threatened another student.

07:11.745 --> 07:12.871
What?

07:18.084 --> 07:19.419
I think I'm here.

07:19.502 --> 07:21.629
And for the record, this is a bad idea.

07:21.712 --> 07:23.048
I have to explain the hand touch

07:23.131 --> 07:25.133
wasn't a big deal before she
blows it out of proportion.

07:25.216 --> 07:27.844
Yeah, showing up at her house unannounced
will totally send that message.

07:27.928 --> 07:30.806
Thanks for the pep talk. Text you later.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.860
Hi, can I help you?

07:43.944 --> 07:45.528
I'm ZoÃ«.

07:47.572 --> 07:49.365
A friend of Grace's.

07:49.449 --> 07:52.035
Oh, um... Grace isn't home.

07:52.118 --> 07:55.163
- Do you know when she'll be back?
- Sorry.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.626
_

08:37.296 --> 08:41.275
_

08:41.876 --> 08:43.919
You're the only one who thinks so.

08:47.295 --> 08:51.548
_

08:53.033 --> 08:54.328
_

08:59.853 --> 09:01.220
_

09:01.244 --> 09:05.572
_

09:06.111 --> 09:08.556
_

09:13.483 --> 09:17.415
_

09:21.499 --> 09:23.376
Attention Degrassi students.

09:23.459 --> 09:26.504
If you haven't already done so,
please pick up your parking pass

09:26.587 --> 09:28.464
here at the office.

09:28.548 --> 09:30.216
You must do so by the end of the week.

09:30.300 --> 09:31.634
Thank you!

09:35.180 --> 09:36.347
Hi.

09:36.973 --> 09:38.599
Oh, so now you want to talk to me?

09:39.893 --> 09:42.770
I finished the backgrounds for our project.

09:42.853 --> 09:45.398
I'm sure you had lots of
free time at home last night.

09:45.481 --> 09:48.443
Are you seriously just gonna stand
there and pretend like nothing happened?

09:49.735 --> 09:50.778
You don't know the whole story.

09:50.861 --> 09:51.862
What's the whole story?

09:51.947 --> 09:53.864
That you're such an
emotionally damaged psycho,

09:53.949 --> 09:56.034
you can't even handle one little touch?

09:59.787 --> 10:01.581
Oh, my God. Is that blood?

10:01.664 --> 10:04.250
- I'm calling 911.
- You don't have to call an ambulance.

10:06.877 --> 10:08.964
Can you just take me home?

10:20.077 --> 10:22.427
_

10:31.527 --> 10:32.903
You really know how to cheer me up.

10:34.616 --> 10:38.861
_

10:40.954 --> 10:43.081
My friends don't understand like you do.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.750
They want me to paste on a happy face.

10:45.833 --> 10:46.834
But...

10:48.794 --> 10:51.089
I feel like nothing will ever be the same.

10:51.113 --> 10:55.255
_

11:00.265 --> 11:01.849
That's so dark.

11:04.394 --> 11:05.979
You guys catfished me?

11:07.647 --> 11:09.399
- Crap.
- We didn't mean to.

11:09.482 --> 11:11.526
Oh, okay, so you just
accidentally made a fake account,

11:11.609 --> 11:13.069
and then accidentally
commented on my picture,

11:13.153 --> 11:15.405
and then accidentally had
super-long conversations with me?

11:15.488 --> 11:16.614
You wouldn't talk to us.

11:16.697 --> 11:18.908
We wanted to know what
was going on with you.

11:18.991 --> 11:20.035
You dyed your hair.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.621
We thought you might...

11:23.704 --> 11:24.747
kill yourself.

11:24.830 --> 11:27.208
That is the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

11:27.292 --> 11:28.459
We were worried about you.

11:28.543 --> 11:31.296
We thought you didn't want
to be friends with us anymore.

11:32.422 --> 11:33.964
Maybe I don't.

11:38.761 --> 11:41.264
So is this about what
I said in English class?

11:41.347 --> 11:44.392
Because Mr. Mitchell asked
us to talk about our feelings.

11:46.102 --> 11:47.145
...cutting the brakes to his car

11:47.228 --> 11:49.064
would really help me heal from this trauma.

11:49.147 --> 11:50.190
That's what I'm talking about.

11:50.273 --> 11:51.482
Maybe decapitation?

11:51.566 --> 11:53.401
There are some antique swords
kicking around the house.

11:53.484 --> 11:54.860
There you go.

11:58.073 --> 11:59.115
Where did you even get that?

11:59.199 --> 12:01.951
Someone put it on Hastygram and
it was reposted hundreds of times.

12:02.034 --> 12:04.995
- A student brought it to my attention.
- Why?

12:05.080 --> 12:07.248
Because people are concerned
about what you're saying.

12:07.332 --> 12:08.583
I need to know who you're
talking about, Miles.

12:08.666 --> 12:11.752
I can't make jokes with my
friend in a private moment?

12:11.836 --> 12:14.089
Not about those things
and not on school property.

12:14.172 --> 12:16.924
You actually think I'm
capable of murdering someone?

12:17.758 --> 12:20.553
You were very upset about what
happened with the election.

12:21.304 --> 12:23.223
- Were you talking about Tristan?
- No.

12:23.306 --> 12:26.267
Well, if you won't tell us...
then I have to suspend you.

12:26.351 --> 12:27.560
Oh, come on, Miles.

12:27.643 --> 12:29.329
Just tell us who you were talking about.

12:29.399 --> 12:31.772
- No, thank you.
- Really?

12:31.856 --> 12:33.941
After everything this
family has been through,

12:34.024 --> 12:36.111
you're gonna get in trouble
again because you won't own up

12:36.194 --> 12:37.278
to your irresponsible behavior?

12:37.362 --> 12:40.115
I was talking about the random
guy I saw you with at our house.

12:41.866 --> 12:44.285
What were you doing home
in the middle of the day?

12:49.081 --> 12:50.875
So, this seems like it's a family matter.

12:50.958 --> 12:53.253
Um... maybe I should step out.

12:53.336 --> 12:55.963
No, let me. Maybe you two will hit it off.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.474
This room's occupied.

13:08.434 --> 13:10.353
I need to practice.

13:10.978 --> 13:13.898
- Well, I need to...
- Cry into your coffee?

13:13.981 --> 13:15.400
Pretty sure you can do that anywhere.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.278
Not that it's any of your business...

13:19.695 --> 13:21.071
but my friends catfished me.

13:21.947 --> 13:23.199
I don't care.

13:24.992 --> 13:27.203
You know, until I
figured out it was them...

13:28.413 --> 13:29.705
it was kinda nice having
someone who got it.

13:29.789 --> 13:32.667
Okay, but that someone
was actually your friends.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.336
- So... they do get it.
- No, they don't.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.257
They just want me to go
back to who I was before.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.341
Before what?

13:40.425 --> 13:42.385
Before my whole life exploded.

13:42.927 --> 13:45.596
I guess they just...
think I'm different now.

13:45.680 --> 13:46.889
Are you?

13:46.972 --> 13:49.392
Yeah, nothing's... black and white anymore.

13:49.475 --> 13:52.812
It's, uh... it's like nothing makes sense.

13:53.813 --> 13:55.940
I think my friends like the old me better.

13:56.023 --> 13:57.400
Then get new friends.

13:57.483 --> 13:58.943
I don't want new friends.

13:59.026 --> 14:01.153
Then go talk to your old ones.

14:01.237 --> 14:03.489
Either way, can... can you get out of here?

14:19.172 --> 14:21.216
Deep breaths, sweetheart.

14:21.799 --> 14:23.092
The nurse will be here soon.

14:24.302 --> 14:25.928
What's going on?

14:26.011 --> 14:28.013
It might be an infection,
but it might just be

14:28.097 --> 14:30.391
because she's been a
little lax with her therapy.

14:31.835 --> 14:33.462
Her therapy?

14:34.812 --> 14:38.233
Oh, you don't know.

14:38.316 --> 14:40.610
Grace has cystic fibrosis.

14:40.693 --> 14:44.364
Cystic fibrosis... But...

14:44.447 --> 14:45.490
not the one that kills you, right?

14:45.573 --> 14:48.158
There's only one kind.

14:49.244 --> 14:51.329
But there have been lots of
advances with the research.

14:52.747 --> 14:54.123
But... when she's old, right?

14:54.207 --> 14:57.210
Not like... soon, or now, or anything?

15:00.380 --> 15:02.382
We're keeping an eye on it.

15:02.465 --> 15:05.510
And we've got a great team to
make sure that Grace stays healthy.

15:05.593 --> 15:08.804
Lots of people with CF
live well into their 30s.

15:08.888 --> 15:13.809
And with more and more therapies
and medicines being developed...

15:13.893 --> 15:16.854
there's no reason to believe that
she won't make it into her 50s.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.904
By turning our backs on the dolphins...

15:21.942 --> 15:24.737
we've really turned our backs on ourselves.

15:27.323 --> 15:28.783
All right!

15:30.951 --> 15:34.455
So... what'd you guys
think of Tiny's piece?

15:35.331 --> 15:37.917
Dude likes his marine life.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.001
Very astute, Winston.

15:40.378 --> 15:42.880
What did it make you think about?

15:43.964 --> 15:46.216
I mean, how did it make you feel?

15:46.301 --> 15:49.387
- I want us to have these conversations.
- Yeah, right.

15:51.264 --> 15:52.557
Miles?

15:53.391 --> 15:54.809
You got something to share?

15:55.799 --> 15:57.700
It's just a bunch of crap.

15:59.439 --> 16:01.649
You don't wanna know how we feel.

16:01.732 --> 16:03.734
'Cause when people ask you
to "express your feelings,"

16:03.818 --> 16:05.361
they don't mean your actual feelings.

16:05.445 --> 16:07.655
They mean the feelings
that they want you to have.

16:07.738 --> 16:10.700
Because people can't deal
with dark, or scary, or weird.

16:11.617 --> 16:14.078
They want you to smile and say,
"Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's great,"

16:14.161 --> 16:15.996
because then they can just
go on with their boring lives,

16:16.080 --> 16:18.082
and never think about you again.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.716
You're gonna give me two pages on anything.

16:26.799 --> 16:28.133
Shock me. Surprise me.

16:28.217 --> 16:30.303
If it's anything like that,
you'll get yourself an A.

16:31.721 --> 16:33.848
Okay, where's my feedback on Tiny's piece?

16:40.605 --> 16:44.274
So you got my text. I
thought we should talk.

16:44.359 --> 16:46.777
On the roof of the school?

16:47.695 --> 16:49.071
I thought you'd want privacy.

16:49.905 --> 16:51.366
- About yesterday...
- No need to explain.

16:51.449 --> 16:53.075
I was up all night, researching.

16:53.158 --> 16:55.411
If you ever want to talk
about anything, I'm here.

17:01.334 --> 17:02.627
- What's this?
- Green smoothie

17:02.710 --> 17:05.170
with ginseng, clove, and
cinnamon, all of which

17:05.253 --> 17:07.382
are super anti-bacterial, to help
fight off those lung infections.

17:07.464 --> 17:09.008
This won't do anything.

17:10.675 --> 17:12.136
Have you heard about that crazy new drug?

17:12.219 --> 17:15.180
People with CF who take it
are living into their 70s.

17:15.263 --> 17:18.058
It's for a different genetic
mutation. It won't work for me.

17:18.142 --> 17:19.685
Well, there are lots of
alternative therapies.

17:19.769 --> 17:22.438
I mean, I personally think that
hot yoga is disgusting, but...

17:22.521 --> 17:24.314
Stop it!

17:24.398 --> 17:26.733
- You say you wanna talk?
- I do.

17:26.817 --> 17:29.153
But not about how I'm
going to die before 35!

17:29.236 --> 17:32.865
About how there's no point in anything
because I've got one foot in the grave!

17:35.701 --> 17:37.161
With what you're up against,

17:37.244 --> 17:39.664
it probably feels like
everything is pointless.

17:39.747 --> 17:41.248
You're finally getting it.

17:46.211 --> 17:47.672
So jump.

17:48.798 --> 17:49.799
What?

17:49.882 --> 17:51.216
You've already decided
that your life is over.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.261
You could have 20 more years,
but you've already given up.

17:54.344 --> 17:57.306
You're basically dead, so you
might as well just kill yourself.

18:02.437 --> 18:03.521
You know...

18:05.355 --> 18:06.566
I think you're right.

18:08.358 --> 18:10.570
- I am?
- You've given me a new lease on life.

18:10.653 --> 18:13.238
I think I'll go to med school
and dedicate my life to curing CF.

18:13.322 --> 18:15.616
I was just trying to prove that
you've got stuff to live for!

18:15.700 --> 18:17.743
Shut up!

18:17.827 --> 18:20.580
My whole life has been people
telling me to stay positive!

18:20.663 --> 18:22.707
Everyone wants to talk
about insane miracle cures,

18:22.790 --> 18:24.750
but no one wants to talk
about how I'm going to die!

18:24.834 --> 18:28.421
- Because maybe you won't!
- Because people can't handle it!

18:28.504 --> 18:31.090
In middle school, I was
hospitalized for a month.

18:31.173 --> 18:33.383
In the beginning, people came
to see me. But by the end?

18:34.677 --> 18:35.928
Nothing.

18:39.682 --> 18:43.227
- That's awful.
- This is why I don't do relationships.

18:43.310 --> 18:45.646
Hard to commit when you're one
lung infection away from the end.

18:45.730 --> 18:47.982
I've just accepted that there
won't be anyone at my funeral.

18:48.065 --> 18:49.734
- Don't say that!
- Why not?

18:49.817 --> 18:51.986
It's the truth.

18:52.069 --> 18:53.863
People just can't deal.

18:53.946 --> 18:55.197
I guess I thought you were different.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.127
Hey!

19:09.419 --> 19:10.963
See, I told you it'd work.

19:11.046 --> 19:12.757
What did I tell you about
doubting my abuelita?

19:16.343 --> 19:19.639
I'm sorry I freaked out on you
guys, but what you did was not cool.

19:19.722 --> 19:21.932
We know and we're sorry.

19:22.016 --> 19:25.978
It's just that this summer...
was a tidal wave of misery.

19:26.937 --> 19:28.648
And then my friends,

19:28.731 --> 19:30.983
the only two people left in
the universe that I trust,

19:31.066 --> 19:32.067
go and catfish me.

19:32.151 --> 19:34.111
You can trust us now.

19:34.194 --> 19:37.782
It's just, we didn't know what else
to do. You weren't talking to us and...

19:37.865 --> 19:41.118
you were doing some... pretty
self-destructive things.

19:41.201 --> 19:42.870
Okay, well, I wanted to look different,

19:42.953 --> 19:44.371
because after everything I've been through,

19:44.454 --> 19:45.915
I feel different.

19:45.998 --> 19:48.668
But it's like you guys want me to go
back to the same as how I was before.

19:48.751 --> 19:49.919
We want you to be happy.

19:50.002 --> 19:52.547
But we're okay with you however you are.

19:53.506 --> 19:55.299
- Right, Lo?
- Hmm.

19:56.509 --> 19:59.094
It's okay. I know the hair isn't working.

19:59.178 --> 20:00.680
Oh! Okay, good,

20:00.763 --> 20:03.390
'cause other than that, I
totally love and accept you.

20:03.473 --> 20:05.685
How about hangouts after school?

20:05.768 --> 20:07.394
We promise to listen. Zero judgment.

20:07.477 --> 20:09.229
And what do I do about this?

20:10.147 --> 20:11.649
I already made an
appointment with my colorist.

20:18.155 --> 20:22.743
So, as you can see, this
is me cheering Maya on,

20:22.827 --> 20:25.329
as she headlines for Coachella.

20:25.412 --> 20:27.331
So that makes you her groupie?

20:27.414 --> 20:29.083
No, that makes him my number one fan,

20:29.166 --> 20:30.835
- and maybe, personal chef?
- Oh.

20:31.919 --> 20:33.087
So, your servant?

20:33.170 --> 20:34.421
Oh, my God!

20:35.005 --> 20:37.299
All right, next up, uh...

20:37.382 --> 20:38.759
ZoÃ« and Grace.

20:43.985 --> 20:46.341
So, we're taking an F on this?

20:47.142 --> 20:48.435
Not quite.

20:52.898 --> 20:54.859
The future is uncertain.

20:56.110 --> 20:59.071
Who knows where we'll be in 15 years?

20:59.154 --> 21:01.323
Statistically, one person in this room

21:01.406 --> 21:04.201
will be in prison...

21:04.284 --> 21:05.327
My money's on Zig.

21:05.410 --> 21:07.329
...and two will be dead.

21:08.998 --> 21:10.916
Given her bad-ass lifestyle,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.794
I assume Grace will be one of these people.

21:18.674 --> 21:21.594
Here is me wearing vintage
Valentino at her funeral.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.054
Morbid much?

21:24.138 --> 21:25.890
All right, um...

21:25.973 --> 21:27.099
thank you, ZoÃ«.

21:27.182 --> 21:29.393
Uh, while Carter's setting
up for his presentation,

21:29.476 --> 21:31.646
I'd like to go over the evaluation...

21:31.729 --> 21:35.524
You don't suck as much as most people.

21:39.695 --> 21:42.239
Thanks... I think.

21:45.534 --> 21:47.452
There are, like, five swear
words in the first line.

21:47.536 --> 21:48.954
You can't do that in an English assignment.

21:49.038 --> 21:51.081
Mr. Mitchell told me he wanted
me to "shock and surprise him,"

21:51.165 --> 21:52.875
so I'm going for, like, a
Chuck Palahniuk kind of vibe.

21:52.958 --> 21:54.043
All right.

21:57.212 --> 22:00.424
I'm sure military school
is lovely this time of year.

22:00.507 --> 22:02.426
All right, did you two come
out here just to bug me, then?

22:02.509 --> 22:04.637
No, Mom wants to talk to us.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.056
What's that look?

22:07.139 --> 22:09.099
Nothing, just buckle up, man.

22:17.066 --> 22:18.233
Is everything okay?

22:20.235 --> 22:23.155
I've been meaning to talk with
you guys about this for a while,

22:23.238 --> 22:26.742
but, uh, frankly, it's not
an easy conversation to have.

22:26.826 --> 22:28.327
The truth is...

22:28.410 --> 22:30.245
I've been seeing someone.

22:32.206 --> 22:33.958
Who is it?

22:35.334 --> 22:36.335
It's your father.

22:37.502 --> 22:39.714
- Is he moving back in?
- No, but we...

22:39.797 --> 22:41.340
- we're really working toward that.
- Screw this.

22:42.842 --> 22:45.135
Miles? Miles, don't go!
