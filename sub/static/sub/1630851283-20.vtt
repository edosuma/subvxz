WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:06.172
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
>> TONIGHT, AN ENCORE OF "60

00:06.172 --> 00:15.415
MINUTES PRESENTS," A "60
MINUTES" WILDLIFE TOUR.
>> IF YOU'RE STANDING THERE, YOU
DON'T KNOW THAT SHARK IS THERE.

00:15.415 --> 00:19.352
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
>> YOU DON'T KNOW THAT SHARK IS
THERE.
>> NO IDEA.

00:19.352 --> 00:23.223
SHE IS LIKE TEN FEET OFFSHORE.
>> YEAH.
VERY CLOSE NOW.
>> THAT'S A GREAT WHITE SHARK

00:23.223 --> 00:29.763
LURKING JUST OFF THE COAST OF A
POPULAR CAPE COD BEACH.
WE WANTED TO KNOW WHY THESE
AWE-INSPIRING ANIMALS ARE

00:29.763 --> 00:38.805
COMING CLOSER TO OUR SHORES.
SO, WE WENT OUT INTO THE
NORTH ATLANTIC WITH TWO GROUPS
OF SCIENTISTS.

00:38.805 --> 00:47.280
AND, YES, AT SOME POINT, WE
ACTUALLY NEEDED A BIGGER BOAT TO
SEE WHAT THEY'RE FINDING OUT
ABOUT THE GREAT WHITE SHARK.

00:47.280 --> 00:53.853
(TICKING )
>> YOU FLY UP ALONGSIDE THAT
WOLF, AND YOU SHOOT A
TRANQUILIZING DART INTO IT.

00:53.853 --> 00:59.459
DART'S IN.
DART'S IN.
FIVE MINUTES, IT GOES DOWN.
WE PROCESS THE WOLVES, WE

00:59.459 --> 01:06.900
TAKE BLOOD, AND WE ATTACH A
RADIO COLLAR, AND THEN WE FOLLOW
THEM, FOR THEIR LIFE, HOPEFULLY.
>> YELLOWSTONE WOLVES ARE

01:06.900 --> 01:14.874
FIERCE AND TERRITORIAL.
THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IS
ATTACKS FROM OTHER WOLVES.
>> AND THEIR LOOK IS

01:14.874 --> 01:20.346
UNCONTROLLABLE.
THAT LOOK SAYS, "I AIN'T GOING
TO CONFORM TO YOUR RULES, AND
I'LL DIE BEFORE I DO."

01:20.346 --> 01:29.222
(TICKING )
>> TO CATCH JOEL SARTORE IN
ACTION, WE FLEW HALFWAY AROUND
THE WORLD.

01:29.222 --> 01:35.895
WHAT MAKES A GREAT PICTURE?
>> EMOTION.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE EYES.
WE'RE PRIMATES, AND WE'RE

01:35.895 --> 01:39.466
REALLY, REALLY RESPONSIVE TO
EYES.
>> BUT YOU SHOOT THEM LIKE
THEY'RE MODELS.

01:39.466 --> 01:43.736
>> WE DO.
LIKE THEY'RE GOING IN FOR THEIR
HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR PORTRAIT.
>> HE'S TRYING TO PHOTOGRAPH

01:43.736 --> 01:52.879
EVERY ANIMAL, BIRD, FISH,
REPTILE, AND INSECT IN
CAPTIVITY.
HE CALLS HIS PROJECT THE

01:52.879 --> 01:57.450
PHOTO ARK.
IN THE BIBLE, THE ARK SAVES ALL
THE CREATURES ON EARTH.
>> YEAH.

01:57.450 --> 02:07.093
>> IS THAT YOUR GOAL?
>> EXACTLY.
GIDDY UP.

02:08.461 --> 02:14.567
>> Whitaker: GOOD EVENING.
I'M BILL WHITAKER.
WELCOME TO "60 MINUTES
PRESENTS."

02:14.567 --> 02:20.740
TONIGHT, WE EMBARK ON A
WILDLIFE TOUR.
WE'LL ROAM WITH THE WOLVES
IN THE SNOWS OF YELLOWSTONE;

02:20.740 --> 02:27.547
MARVEL AT THE DIVERSITY OF
THE ANIMAL WORLD THROUGH THE
LENS OF A "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC"
PHOTOGRAPHER.

02:27.547 --> 02:33.386
BUT WE BEGIN WITH A DIVE INTO
THE LIVES OF SOME OF THE OCEAN'S
MOST STORIED-- AND FEARED--
PREDATORS.

02:33.386 --> 02:40.360
THE BOOK AND MOVIE "JAWS"
INTRODUCED US TO THE GREAT WHITE
SHARK MORE THAN 40 YEARS AGO,
AND SCARED US OUT OF OUR WITS.

02:40.360 --> 02:49.168
MUCH OF THE FILM WAS SHOT IN
THE WATERS OFF CAPE COD,
MASSACHUSETTS; THE IRONY IS
THAT WHEN IT CAME OUT IN THE

02:49.168 --> 02:56.342
MID-1970s, THERE WERE VERY FEW
WHITE SHARKS AROUND CAPE COD.
THE SPECIES WAS IN THE MIDST OF
A SERIOUS DECLINE, AND THE MOVIE

02:56.342 --> 03:05.885
MADE IT WORSE, WITH FISHERMEN
HUNTING THE FEW GREAT WHITES
THAT THERE WERE.
WHITE SHARKS WERE GRANTED

03:05.885 --> 03:12.258
FEDERAL PROTECTION IN 1997, AND
IN THE YEARS SINCE, HAVE MADE A
COMEBACK THAT HAS DELIGHTED
CONSERVATIONISTS AND FRIGHTENED

03:12.258 --> 03:17.430
SWIMMERS AND SURFERS.
ON CAPE COD THIS PAST SUMMER,
SHARK SIGHTINGS AND BEACH
CLOSINGS WERE ABOUT AS COMMON AS

03:17.430 --> 03:27.006
LOBSTER ROLLS.
AS WE FIRST REPORTED LAST
SEPTEMBER, THE ATLANTIC GREAT
WHITE SHARK IS BACK.

03:27.006 --> 03:31.844
>> Greg Skomal: LOOK AT THIS
FISH.
>> Whitaker: LOOK AT THIS FISH.
>> Skomal: YEAH, LOOK AT THIS

03:31.844 --> 03:39.619
FISH.
>> Whitaker: GEEZ.
ON A TUESDAY IN MID-SEPTEMBER,
WE'RE WITH DR. GREG SKOMAL,

03:39.619 --> 03:45.892
CHIEF SHARK SCIENTIST FOR THE
MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF
MARINE FISHERIES, FOLLOWING AN
11-FOOT WHITE SHARK SWIMMING

03:45.892 --> 03:52.231
JUST FEET OFF THE BEACH NEAR
TRURO ON CAPE COD.
>> Skomal: AND IF YOU'RE
STANDING THERE, YOU DON'T KNOW

03:52.231 --> 03:56.603
THAT SHARK'S THERE.
>> Whitaker: YOU HAVE NO IDEA!
>> Skomal: YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
SHARK IS THERE.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.472
>> Whitaker: NO IDEA.
SHE'S LIKE TEN FEET OFF SHORE!
>> Skomal: YEAH.
VERY CLOSE NOW.

03:59.472 --> 04:07.680
>> Whitaker: WHITE SHARKS ARE SO
CLOSE TO SHORE BECAUSE THAT'S
WHERE THEIR FAVORITE FOOD IS--
GREY SEALS, THOUSANDS OF WHICH

04:07.680 --> 04:12.218
NOW CALL CAPE COD HOME.
>> Skomal: THIS IS THE
RESTAURANT RIGHT HERE.
THESE SHARKS HAVE FOUND THE

04:12.218 --> 04:17.156
RESTAURANT, AND THEY'RE WAITING
FOR THE DOORS TO OPEN.
YOU KNOW?
AND WHEN THOSE SEALS BEGIN TO

04:17.156 --> 04:21.294
LEAVE THE BEACH... YOU KNOW.
>> Whitaker: IT'S DINNERTIME.
>> Skomal: IT'S DINNERTIME.
>> Whitaker: SKOMAL AND HIS TEAM

04:21.294 --> 04:30.136
FROM THE ATLANTIC WHITE SHARK
CONSERVANCY ARE TRYING TO ATTACH
ELECTRONIC TRACKING TAGS TO AS
MANY SHARKS AS THEY CAN--

04:30.136 --> 04:38.044
230 SO FAR.
THE WAY THEY DO IT IS
FASCINATING.
PILOT WAYNE DAVIS LOCATES SHARKS

04:38.044 --> 04:43.716
FROM HIS SPOTTER PLANE, THEN
GUIDES BOAT CAPTAIN JOHN KING
ONTO THEM.
>> Wayne Davis: USE A LITTLE

04:43.716 --> 04:48.388
GAS, JOHN.
HE'S RIGHT ON THE SHOAL.
IT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT'S GOING
TO GET.

04:48.388 --> 04:55.795
>> Whitaker: STANDING ON A
PULPIT ON THE BOW OF A SMALL
BOAT, GREG SKOMAL WIELDS A LONG
POLE THAT HAS A DART AND A TAG

04:55.795 --> 05:00.400
AT THE END.
>> Skomal: RIGHT, RIGHT THERE.
DONE.
>> Whitaker: YOU GOT HIM?

05:00.400 --> 05:04.270
>> Skomal: TAGGED.
>> Whitaker: THAT WAS IT!
>> Megan Winton: BEAUTIFUL, ALL
RIGHT.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.907
>> John King: MY GOD.
BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL PLACEMENT,
GREG.
>> Skomal: THANK YOU, JOHN.

05:07.907 --> 05:12.311
NICE WORK.
>> Whitaker: YOU CAN SEE, YOU
CAN SEE WHERE IT WAS?
>> Skomal: YEAH, YOU CAN SEE IT

05:12.311 --> 05:15.281
RIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE DORSAL.
SEE IT?
>> Whitaker: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH.

05:15.281 --> 05:20.353
>> Skomal: NOW WE'RE GOING TO
LEARN ABOUT THAT FISH FOR THE
NEXT NINE, TEN YEARS.
>> Whitaker: THEY WILL TRACK THE

05:20.353 --> 05:28.394
FISH BECAUSE THE TAG CONSTANTLY
EMITS A "PING" THAT IS PICKED UP
WHEN THE SHARK SWIMS CLOSE TO
ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS ATTACHED TO

05:28.394 --> 05:32.265
BUOYS.
AND HOW MANY OF THESE DO YOU
HAVE UP AND DOWN THE COAST?
>> Skomal: WE HAVE OVER A

05:32.265 --> 05:34.934
HUNDRED OUT ALL OVER
MASSACHUSETTS.
>> Whitaker: AND THAT'S JUST
YOU.

05:34.934 --> 05:38.771
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OTHERS.
>> Skomal: THAT'S JUST US, YEAH.
AND SO WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACK THE
MOVEMENTS OF OUR WHITE SHARKS

05:38.771 --> 05:45.511
WHEN THEY LEAVE HERE.
>> Whitaker: THE TAGS ALSO HELP
SKOMAL, AND HIS RESEARCH
COLLEAGUE MEGAN WINTON, FIGURE

05:45.511 --> 05:56.289
OUT JUST HOW MANY SHARKS THERE
ARE, AND HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT
CAPE COD IS NOW ONE OF THE
WORLD'S WHITE SHARK "HOT SPOTS."

05:56.289 --> 06:03.930
THEY REGULARLY HAUL BUOYS OUT OF
THE WATER AND DOWNLOAD DATA FROM
THEM TO A TABLET THAT DISPLAYS
EACH TIME A TAGGED SHARK SWIMS

06:03.930 --> 06:09.235
BY.
>> Winton: LOTS OF WHITE SHARK
DETECTIONS.
>> Whitaker: THIS TELLS THEM A

06:09.235 --> 06:16.442
LOT ABOUT INDIVIDUALS.
THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THEY'RE
LONERS, AND THAT THE SAME ONE
WILL OFTEN COME BACK TO

06:16.442 --> 06:25.351
PRECISELY THE SAME HUNTING
GROUND, YEAR AFTER YEAR.
A WHITE SHARK SEEMED TO BE
HUNTING GREG SKOMAL IN 2018

06:25.351 --> 06:31.891
WHEN IT CAME UP, JAWS OPEN,
RIGHT UNDER THE PULPIT.
>> King: OH!
HOLY CRAP!

06:31.891 --> 06:35.762
>> Skomal: IT CAME RIGHT UP AND
OPENED ITS MOUTH RIGHT AT MY
FEET!
>> Whitaker: THAT SHOOK HIM UP

06:35.762 --> 06:40.500
FOR A BIT.
BUT HE INSISTS IT SHOULDN'T
SHAKE UP THE PUBLIC.
>> Skomal: ALL I CAN TELL THEM

06:40.500 --> 06:45.238
IS, IS THAT THE PROBABILITY OF
THEM BEING BITTEN IS INCREDIBLY
LOW.
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE I CAN

06:45.238 --> 06:51.110
SAY.
>> Whitaker: BECAUSE THAT FEAR
IS PRIMAL.
>> Skomal: I THINK THAT FEAR IS

06:51.110 --> 06:57.850
PRIMAL.
I THINK IT'S INNATE.
I THINK IT'S IN THEM, IT'S IN
US, IT'S IN ALL OF US.

06:57.850 --> 07:07.193
>> Whitaker: FIVE DAYS AFTER OUR
DAY ON THE WATER OFF CAPE COD,
WE NEEDED A BIGGER BOAT, FOR A
VERY DIFFERENT SHARK-TAGGING

07:07.193 --> 07:11.097
EXPEDITION 600 MILES TO THE
NORTHEAST, JUST OFF HAY ISLAND
IN NOVA SCOTIA.
>> Chris Fischer: MORNING.

07:11.097 --> 07:17.303
>> Whitaker: MORNING, HOW ARE
YOU?
WE BOARDED A 125-FOOT RESEARCH
SHIP CALLED "OCEARCH," WHICH HAS

07:17.303 --> 07:25.912
BEEN TAGGING ATLANTIC WHITE
SHARKS FROM FLORIDA TO CANADA
SINCE 2012.
FOUNDER CHRIS FISCHER INVITED US

07:25.912 --> 07:34.153
TO JOIN THE FIRST DAY OF HIS
2019 NOVA SCOTIA EXPEDITION.
>> Fischer: AND WE COME UP HERE.
WE'VE BEEN HERE 24 HOURS.

07:34.153 --> 07:41.594
WE'VE SEEN TWO OR THREE SHARKS,
AND NO ONE EVER EVEN KNEW TO
COME LOOK HERE BEFORE.
>> Whitaker: "OCEARCH" LAUNCHES

07:41.594 --> 07:48.334
A TEAM ON A SMALL BOAT TO HOOK
WHITE SHARKS, MUCH AS FISHERMEN
WOULD, USING LONG LINES, BAIT
AND FLOATS TO KEEP THEM NEAR THE

07:48.334 --> 07:51.437
SURFACE.
>> Fischer: HOOKED IN THE CORNER
OF THE MOUTH.
SQUARED AWAY.

07:51.437 --> 07:57.910
EVERYTHING'S GREEN OUT HERE.
>> Whitaker: "OCEARCH" IS A
CONVERTED ALASKAN CRAB BOAT
EQUIPPED WITH A PLATFORM THAT'S

07:57.910 --> 08:08.254
LOWERED INTO THE WATER OFF ONE
SIDE.
AS THE SMALL BOAT TOWS THE SHARK
ALONGSIDE, "OCEARCH" FISHING

08:08.254 --> 08:16.395
MASTER BRETT McBRIDE LEAPS ONTO
THE SUBMERGED PLATFORM, INTO
WATER THAT'S 49 DEGREES.
WITH THE LINE IN HIS HAND, HE

08:16.395 --> 08:30.409
GUIDES AN 1,100-POUND MALE WHITE
SHARK ONTO THE CRADLE.
WHOA, WHOA!
LOOK AT THAT.

08:30.409 --> 08:34.981
THE PLATFORM IS RAISED OUT OF
THE WATER, EFFECTIVELY
"BEACHING" THE SHARK.
IT OFFERS NO RESISTANCE, WORN

08:34.981 --> 08:44.790
OUT AFTER BEING HOOKED AND
"TOWED" FOR NEARLY AN HOUR.
McBRIDE GETS RIGHT IN ITS FACE
TO INSERT A HOSE BETWEEN ITS

08:44.790 --> 08:49.729
GIANT JAWS.
>> Brett McBride: I'M KEEPING
CLEAN SEAWATER FLOWING OVER ITS
GILLS.

08:49.729 --> 08:55.167
I'M MAKING SURE IT'S GETTING
GOOD OXYGEN.
>> Whitaker: A TEAM MEMBER
STARTS A CLOCK.

08:55.167 --> 09:00.740
THEY DON'T WANT TO KEEP THE
SHARK OUT OF THE WATER FOR MORE
THAN 15 MINUTES.
AND "OCEARCH" CHIEF SCIENTIST

09:00.740 --> 09:08.014
DR. ROBERT HEUTER GIVES ME AN
OPPORTUNITY I'M NOT QUITE SURE I
WANT.
>> Robert Hueter: SO BILL, JUST

09:08.014 --> 09:13.352
GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.
AND TAKE YOUR TIME.
JUST FEEL HOW BEAUTIFUL THAT IS.
>> Whitaker: OH MY GOD.

09:13.352 --> 09:18.591
>> Hueter: HOW SMOOTH.
AND THEN GO THIS WAY.
RUB YOUR HAND THE OTHER WAY AND
YOU FEEL IT'S KIND OF BUMPY.

09:18.591 --> 09:29.802
>> Whitaker: MY GOD.
THE "OCEARCH" TEAM SWARMS THE
SHARK, DRAWING BLOOD AND TISSUE
SAMPLES, PICKING OFF PARASITES

09:29.802 --> 09:36.642
TO BE ANALYZED, AND MEASURING
ITS GIRTH AND LENGTH.
>> Christian Purcell: 371 TOTAL!
>> Whitaker: THAT'S 371

09:36.642 --> 09:44.917
CENTIMETERS, OR 12 FEET, TWO
INCHES.
THE BIGGEST ATLANTIC GREAT WHITE
THEY'VE CAUGHT WAS A 16-FOOT

09:44.917 --> 09:55.194
FEMALE WHO WEIGHED 3,500 POUNDS.
AS CHRIS FISCHER MEASURES THIS
ONE, BOB HUETER INSERTS AN
ACOUSTIC TAG, LIKE THE ONE GREG

09:55.194 --> 10:03.736
SKOMAL ATTACHES WITH A DART.
THAT DOESN'T HARM THE SHARK?
>> Hueter: NO, IT'S JUST, IT
FLOATS IN THE BODY CAVITY.

10:03.736 --> 10:09.909
>> Fischer: LET'S ROLL THE
SHARK.
EVERYBODY STEP BACK.
>> Whitaker: AFTER THE SHARK IS

10:09.909 --> 10:12.945
ROLLED ONTO ITS BELLY...
>> THERE WE ARE!
>> Christina Lobuglio: WE'RE AT
11 MINUTES!

10:12.945 --> 10:17.783
>> Whitaker: ...CHRIS FISCHER
DRILLS THROUGH THE DORSAL FIN.
HE INSISTS IT'S NO MORE PAINFUL
THAN PIERCING AN EAR.

10:17.783 --> 10:24.090
HE'S ATTACHING THE TAG THAT
REALLY SETS "OCEARCH" APART
IN THE WORLD OF WHITE SHARK
TRACKING.

10:24.090 --> 10:31.464
>> Fischer: THIS SPOT TAG ALLOWS
US TO TRACK THIS ANIMAL IN REAL-
TIME FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS.
>> Whitaker: THE SPOT TAG WILL

10:31.464 --> 10:36.902
SEND A SIGNAL TO A SATELLITE
EACH TIME THIS SHARK'S DORSAL
FIN COMES ABOVE THE SURFACE OF
THE WATER.

10:36.902 --> 10:43.876
"OCEARCH" HAS PUT MORE THAN 50
OF THEM ON ATLANTIC WHITE
SHARKS, AND DISPLAYS THEIR
TRACKS ON ITS WEBSITE.

10:43.876 --> 10:48.147
>> Fischer: AND THAT'S HOW YOU
LEARN NOT ONLY WHERE THEY ARE,
BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING, WHERE
THEY ARE, WHICH IS WHAT YOU NEED

10:48.147 --> 10:51.317
TO KNOW TO MANAGE.
RIGHT?
WHERE'S THE MATING?
WHERE'S THE BIRTHING?

10:51.317 --> 10:56.856
WHERE'S THE FORAGING?
WHERE'S THE GESTATING?
>> Whitaker: WHILE SOME
SCIENTISTS CRITICIZE THE

10:56.856 --> 11:03.696
"OCEARCH" TECHNIQUES AS TOO
INVASIVE, THEY ARE GATHERING A
LOT OF DATA.
17 DIFFERENT RESEARCH PROJECTS

11:03.696 --> 11:10.469
WILL GET SAMPLES AND INFORMATION
FROM A SINGLE SHARK.
>> DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO MAKE
EVERYBODY HAPPY.

11:10.469 --> 11:19.745
>> Whitaker: STILL, THERE ARE A
LOT OF UNKNOWNS.
NO WHITE SHARK HAS EVER BEEN
KEPT IN CAPTIVITY, AND NO ONE

11:19.745 --> 11:26.652
HAS EVER SEEN THEM MATE OR GIVE
BIRTH ANYWHERE.
BUT THERE ARE ALSO DISCOVERIES.
THE "OCEARCH" TEAM HAS CONFIRMED

11:26.652 --> 11:34.393
THAT THE WATERS OFF LONG ISLAND
ARE AN IMPORTANT "NURSERY" FOR
BABY WHITES LIKE THESE, CALLED
"PUPS."

11:34.393 --> 11:40.132
DID YOU GET HIM?
>> Skomal: YEP, GOT HIM.
>> Whitaker: AND BACK ON CAPE
COD, ACOUSTIC TAGS ARE TEACHING

11:40.132 --> 11:48.107
GREG SKOMAL ABOUT JUST HOW FAR
ADULT SHARKS TRAVEL.
WHAT'S THE MOST INTERESTING
THING YOU'VE LEARNED ABOUT THEM?

11:48.107 --> 11:54.814
>> Skomal: WE NOW KNOW, BASED ON
THE TAGGING WORK WE'VE DONE THE
LAST TEN YEARS, IS THAT, WHEN
THEY LEAVE CAPE COD, THEY GO

11:54.814 --> 12:00.086
DOWN TO FLORIDA, AND THEY SPEND
THE TIME IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.
AND THEY OVER-WINTER IN THESE
SOUTHERN CLIMATES.

12:00.086 --> 12:05.558
BUT SINCE SOME OF THESE SHARKS
MOVE OUT INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC
OCEAN, AND WHEN THEY'RE OUT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC, THEY

12:05.558 --> 12:12.031
DIVE DOWN AT DEPTHS AS GREAT AS
3,000 FEET EVERY DAY.
AND THERE'S NOT A SCIENTIST ON
EARTH THAT CAN TELL YOU WHY THEY

12:12.031 --> 12:16.936
DO THAT.
>> Whitaker: SCIENTISTS HAVE
LEARNED HOW LONG-LIVED THEY ARE.
>> Skomal: WHITE SHARKS, WE NOW

12:16.936 --> 12:23.209
KNOW, LIVE OVER 70 YEARS.
>> Whitaker: 70 YEARS?
>> Skomal: 70 YEARS.
>> Whitaker: THEY DON'T START

12:23.209 --> 12:31.784
HUNTING SEALS UNTIL THEIR LATE
TEENS, BUT WHEN THEY DO, WATCH
OUT.
IN THIS FOOTAGE GREG SKOMAL

12:31.784 --> 12:39.091
SHOT, YOU SEE A SEAL LEAP OUT OF
THE WATER WITH A SHARK RIGHT ON
ITS TAIL.
>> Skomal: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

12:39.091 --> 12:46.765
THAT BEFORE?
>> Whitaker: HERE, THE SHARK
CATCHES A SEAL, AND THE OCEAN
WATER EXPLODES IN BLOOD RED IN

12:46.765 --> 12:56.175
AN INSTANT.
THE SHARK THEN SWIMS AWAY, WITH
HALF A SEAL IN ITS JAWS.
SEALS HAVE BEEN PROTECTED BY

12:56.175 --> 13:06.719
FEDERAL LAW SINCE 1972, AND SOME
25,000 NOW LIVE NEAR CAPE COD.
MORE SEALS MEANS MORE SHARKS,
AND THAT'S WHAT WORRIES THE

13:06.719 --> 13:14.326
SWIMMERS AND SURFERS SHARING THE
WATER WITH THEM.
THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN AT THE CAPE
IN SEPTEMBER 2019.

13:14.326 --> 13:22.234
GREAT WHITE SHARKS VERY RARELY
ATTACK PEOPLE.
THE ONE THAT KILLED A SWIMMER
NAMED ARTHUR MEDICI JUST OFF

13:22.234 --> 13:29.308
THIS BEACH LAST SEPTEMBER WAS
THE FIRST FATAL ATTACK ON CAPE
COD SINCE 1936.
BUT IT TRIGGERED A FEAR OF

13:29.308 --> 13:36.215
ATTACKS THAT CAN HARDLY BE
MEASURED.
SCARY WARNING SIGNS ON EVERY
BEACH.

13:36.215 --> 13:43.355
"STOP-BLEED KITS" AT LIFEGUARD
STANDS.
A PHONE APP CALLED "SHARKTIVITY"
THAT REPORTS SIGHTINGS IN REAL-

13:43.355 --> 13:52.231
TIME, WITH LOCAL NEWS DOING MUCH
THE SAME, AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS
PACKED WITH FRIGHTENED CITIZENS.
>> Woman: NO SHARKS OR SEALS ARE

13:52.231 --> 13:58.704
WORTH A YOUNG MAN'S LIFE.
THEY'RE JUST NOT.
(APPLAUSE )
>> Whitaker: YOU'RE THE

13:58.704 --> 14:04.276
SCIENTIST, BUT YOU ALSO LIVE
HERE, AND, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE
AFRAID.
>> Skomal: WE CAN'T BURY OUR

14:04.276 --> 14:10.182
HEADS IN THE SAND WHEN IT COMES
TO SHARK ATTACKS.
AND SO, THAT'S IN MY FACE EVERY
DAY NOW.

14:10.182 --> 14:14.520
AND THEN IT ALWAYS FALLS BACK ON
THE-- YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION OF,
"WELL, WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR
KIDS TO DO?"

14:14.520 --> 14:19.091
YOU KNOW?
>> Whitaker: WHAT DO YOU TELL
YOUR KIDS TO DO?
>> Skomal: YOU KNOW, I-- I TELL

14:19.091 --> 14:25.164
MY KIDS, DON'T GO OUT PAST
WAIST-DEEP.
>> Whitaker: THAT'S CHILLING
ADVICE, FOR SWIMMERS, FOR

14:25.164 --> 14:30.269
SURFERS, AND FOR THE CAPE COD
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
>> Fischer: I MEAN, WE'VE
BASICALLY GOT TO UNDO EVERYTHING

14:30.269 --> 14:35.474
"JAWS" DID.
I MEAN, WE'VE GOT HALF THE
PEOPLE ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD
TERRIFIED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

14:35.474 --> 14:42.047
ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS.
>> Whitaker: I SAW THE TEETH ON
THIS CHARACTER HERE.
PEOPLE WHO ARE SWIMMING NEARBY

14:42.047 --> 14:45.851
SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF THAT?
>> Fischer: NO.
THEY'RE CLEVER.
LIKE, EVEN THOUGH WE DRESS UP

14:45.851 --> 14:48.921
LIKE THEIR FOOD AND TRY TO FOOL
THEM, THEY VERY RARELY GET
FOOLED.
>> Whitaker: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:48.921 --> 14:52.891
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DRESS UP LIKE
THEIR FOOD?
>> Fischer: YOU EVER SEEN WHAT
SOMEONE IN A WETSUIT LOOKS LIKE,

14:52.891 --> 15:00.299
COMPARED TO A SEAL?
>> Whitaker: HE'S GOT A POINT.
WHEN THIS WHITE SHARK'S
15 MINUTES ON THE "OCEARCH"

15:00.299 --> 15:06.205
PLATFORM RAN OUT, WE WERE
ORDERED OFF.
THAT WAS AMAZING!
THEY GAVE HIM A NAME...

15:06.205 --> 15:10.843
>> Fischer: "SYDNEY!"
>> Whitaker: ...FOR THE NEAREST
NOVA SCOTIA TOWN, AND BEGAN
LOWERING HIM BACK INTO THE

15:10.843 --> 15:16.348
WATER.
AND WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE TO
HIM-- THIS DOES NOT HARM OR HURT
THE SHARK AT ALL?

15:16.348 --> 15:22.388
>> Hueter: NO, BECAUSE WE'RE--
WE'RE MONITORING THE STRESS OF
THE ANIMAL THROUGHOUT.
>> Whitaker: AFTER A COUPLE OF

15:22.388 --> 15:27.426
MINUTES, HE PERKED UP,
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE NOTICED THE
"OCEARCH" PHOTOGRAPHER IN THE
WATER AROUND THE CORNER.

15:27.426 --> 15:34.600
>> OH, HE SEES YOU!
HE SEES YOU, ROB!
>> Whitaker: FINALLY, WITH
FISH MASTER BRETT McBRIDE

15:34.600 --> 15:41.140
HELPING "STEER" HIM BY THE TAIL,
OFF WENT SYDNEY.
>> THERE HE GOES.
>> DO YOUR THING.

15:41.140 --> 15:48.347
>> GOOD LUCK, OLD BOY.
SYDNEY.
YEAH.
(APPLAUSE )

15:48.347 --> 15:59.658
(TICKING )
>>HOW TO BE SHARK SMART AT THE
SHORE.

16:01.026 --> 16:06.799
>> Whitaker: IT'S SAFE TO SAY
THAT WOLVES HAVE AN IMAGE
PROBLEM.
SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, THEY'VE

16:06.799 --> 16:15.574
BEEN PORTRAYED IN FABLES AND
LEGENDS, AND THE BIBLE, AS
FEARSOME, VORACIOUS PREDATORS.
THE STORY OF THE "BIG BAD WOLF"

16:15.574 --> 16:22.915
MAY BE THE MOST MEMORABLE AND
FRIGHTENING OF ALL THE FAIRY
TALES TOLD BY THE BROTHERS
GRIMM.

16:22.915 --> 16:27.786
THAT "GRIM" REPUTATION ACTUALLY
PRODUCED A VERY REAL RESULT IN
AMERICA IN THE EARLY 20th
CENTURY.

16:27.786 --> 16:35.494
WOLVES WERE WIPED OFF THE
LANDSCAPE-- TRAPPED, POISONED,
AND HUNTED UNTIL THERE WAS NOT A
SINGLE ONE LEFT IN THE AMERICAN

16:35.494 --> 16:44.570
WEST.
THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
BROUGHT WOLVES BACK TO
YELLOWSTONE PARK ALMOST EXACTLY

16:44.570 --> 16:51.477
25 YEARS AGO, FOLLOWING A BITTER
DEBATE BETWEEN WILDLIFE GROUPS,
WHO WANTED THEM RESTORED, AND
RANCHERS, WHO MOST DEFINITELY

16:51.477 --> 16:57.616
DIDN'T.
EVEN TODAY, THE WOLVES OF
YELLOWSTONE STIR STRONG
EMOTIONS.

16:57.616 --> 17:07.860
BUT, AS WE FIRST REPORTED IN
2018, THEY'VE ALSO HAD AN IMPACT
THAT ALMOST NO ONE SAW COMING.
IN THE DEAD OF WINTER,

17:07.860 --> 17:19.138
YELLOWSTONE PARK IS A BEAUTIFUL
BUT FORBIDDING PLACE.
HOWLING WIND, SUB-ZERO
TEMPERATURES, SIX FEET OF SNOW.

17:19.138 --> 17:29.782
JUST FINDING ENOUGH FOOD TO
SURVIVE IS A PROFOUND STRUGGLE
FOR EVERY ANIMAL.
WATERFOWL, BISON, ELK, FOXES,

17:29.782 --> 17:37.389
THEY ALL HAVE TO WORK FOR EVERY
MORSEL.
YELLOWSTONE WAS THE WORLD'S
FIRST NATIONAL PARK, FOUNDED IN

17:37.389 --> 17:45.664
1872.
AND IT REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST
VISITED-- MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
COME HERE EVERY SUMMER.

17:45.664 --> 17:49.768
BUT THEY USED TO PRETTY MUCH
LEAVE IT TO THE WILDLIFE IN THE
WINTER-- UNTIL THE WOLVES CAME
BACK.

17:49.768 --> 17:55.707
>> Woman: OH, THEY'RE BEHIND THE
TREE.
>> Whitaker: NOW, REPORTS OF A
WOLF SIGHTING CAN PRODUCE A

17:55.707 --> 18:01.346
TRAFFIC JAM ALONG THE ONE
50-MILE STRETCH OF ROAD THE PARK
SERVICE KEEPS OPEN IN THE
WINTER.

18:01.346 --> 18:07.085
>> Man: OH, WE GOT A WOLF UP,
MOVING.
>> Woman: OH, NEAT.
>> Whitaker: VISITORS WITH

18:07.085 --> 18:12.991
SPOTTING SCOPES GATHER IN
ABSOLUTELY FRIGID WEATHER FOR A
MOMENTARY, LONG-DISTANCE VIEW.
>> Doug Smith: BILL, THESE FOLKS

18:12.991 --> 18:20.165
CAME FROM GERMANY TO SEE WOLVES.
>> Whitaker: HOW ABOUT THAT?
DOUG SMITH RUNS THE YELLOWSTONE
WOLF RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR THE

18:20.165 --> 18:23.735
PARK SERVICE.
>> Smith: AND NO ONE PREDICTED
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, WE--

18:23.735 --> 18:30.342
>> Whitaker: THE-- THE-- THE
APPEAL OF COMING IN TO SEE THE
WOLVES?
>> Smith: YES.

18:30.342 --> 18:35.747
AND IT TRULY HAS BEEN AMAZING.
AND, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE A YEAR, WE ESTIMATE, COME
HERE JUST TO SEE WOLVES.

18:35.747 --> 18:45.357
(HOWL )
>> Whitaker: WOLF TOURISM PUMPS
$35 MILLION A YEAR INTO THE
LOCAL ECONOMY, MUCH OF IT SPENT

18:45.357 --> 18:49.495
IN THE WINTER, WHICH IS PRIME
WOLF-WATCHING TIME.
>> Glen Mai: WE'VE SEEN WOLVES
ALL THREE DAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN

18:49.495 --> 18:56.301
OUT.
>> Whitaker: GLEN MAI IS A
RETIRED F.B.I. AGENT FROM
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA.

18:56.301 --> 19:02.307
KATHY LOMBARD IS A RETIRED COP
FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.
THEY BOTH PAID AN OUTFITTER
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO TAKE

19:02.307 --> 19:10.716
THEM WOLF-WATCHING.
SO, WHAT IS IT ABOUT WOLVES THAT
BRING YOU ALL THE WAY OUT HERE
FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE, TO SIT OUT

19:10.716 --> 19:15.220
HERE AND JUST HOPE FOR THE
CHANCE TO SEE THEM?
>> Kathy Lombard: THEY'VE BEEN
ABLE TO BRING WOLVES BACK INTO

19:15.220 --> 19:24.997
YELLOWSTONE AND THEY'VE THRIVED.
SO, THAT'S JUST AN AWESOME THING
TO SEE.
>> Whitaker: IT WAS JANUARY 12,

19:24.997 --> 19:34.206
1995, WHEN THE FIRST GREY
WOLVES, CAPTURED IN CANADA, WERE
CARRIED INTO YELLOWSTONE PARK.
IT DREW BOTH NATIONAL ATTENTION

19:34.206 --> 19:42.214
AND FIERCE OPPOSITION.
SO MUCH THAT ARMED GUARDS WERE
POSTED TO PROTECT THOSE WOLVES.
SO, THE FIRST WOLVES RELEASED

19:42.214 --> 19:48.453
INTO YELLOWSTONE PARK WERE
RELEASED RIGHT BACK HERE IN THIS
THICKET?
>> Smith: YES.

19:48.453 --> 19:53.392
SO, A TOTAL OF 41, OVER THREE
YEARS.
>> Whitaker: HOW MANY ARE IN THE
PARK NOW?

19:53.392 --> 19:59.565
>> Smith: WE'VE GOT 96 IN TEN
PACKS, AND IT'S BEEN ROUGHLY
100 WOLVES THE LAST TEN YEARS.
VERY STABLE.

19:59.565 --> 20:07.506
>> Whitaker: THOSE TEN PACKS, OF
ABOUT TEN WOLVES EACH, ARE,
WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE MOST
CLOSELY OBSERVED AND STUDIED

20:07.506 --> 20:13.645
WOLVES ON EARTH.
>> Smith: OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP IN
TOUCH WITH EACH PACK.
THAT'S OUR GOAL.

20:13.645 --> 20:20.786
>> Whitaker: THEY DO THAT BY
TRYING TO ATTACH RADIO COLLARS
TO AT LEAST TWO WOLVES IN EACH
OF THE PARK'S PACKS.

20:20.786 --> 20:30.162
>> Smith: SO YOU FLY OUT IN THE
AIRPLANE, FIND WOLVES IN THE
OPEN.
THAT AIRPLANE RADIOS A WAITING

20:30.162 --> 20:35.133
HELICOPTER ON THE GROUND.
THAT HELICOPTER FLIES OUT WITH A
GUNNER IN THE BACKSEAT.
>> Whitaker: THAT GUNNER IS

20:35.133 --> 20:42.374
ALMOST ALWAYS SMITH HIMSELF.
>> LOADED.
>> OKAY.
>> Smith: AND YOU FLY UP

20:42.374 --> 20:47.412
ALONGSIDE THAT WOLF, AND YOU
SHOOT A TRANQUILIZING DART INTO
IT.
>> DART'S IN!

20:47.412 --> 20:50.649
DART'S IN!
>> Smith: FIVE MINUTES, IT GOES
DOWN.
WE PROCESS THE WOLVES.

20:50.649 --> 20:58.090
WE TAKE BLOOD.
WE MEASURE THEM.
WE LOOK AT THEIR HEALTH.
AND WE ATTACH A RADIO COLLAR.

20:58.090 --> 21:03.562
AND THEN WE FOLLOW THEM FOR
THEIR LIFE, HOPEFULLY.
>> Whitaker: THAT LIFE, BY THE
WAY, TYPICALLY LASTS ABOUT FIVE

21:03.562 --> 21:10.168
YEARS.
YELLOWSTONE WOLVES ARE FIERCE,
AND TERRITORIAL; THE LEADING
CAUSE OF DEATH IS ATTACKS FROM

21:10.168 --> 21:18.310
OTHER WOLVES.
>> Smith: AND THEIR LOOK IS
UNCONTROLLABLE.
THAT LOOK SAYS, "I AIN'T GOING

21:18.310 --> 21:26.351
TO CONFORM TO YOUR RULES.
AND I'LL DIE BEFORE I DO."
AND THAT'S POWERFUL.
>> THAT IS A LOCATION OF A WOLF.

21:26.351 --> 21:31.757
>> Whitaker: DATA FROM THE RADIO
COLLARS HAS HELPED SMITH'S TEAM
TO LEARN VOLUMES ABOUT WOLF
BEHAVIOR.

21:31.757 --> 21:36.962
>> Woman: YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE
BOULDER IS, BY ITSELF.
>> Man: YEAH.
>> Whitaker: IT ALSO HELPS ALL

21:36.962 --> 21:44.703
THOSE WOLF WATCHERS FIND THEM.
PARK SERVICE VOLUNTEER RICK
McINTYRE IS OUT EVERY DAY,
LISTENING FOR SIGNALS...

21:44.703 --> 21:51.276
>> Rick McIntyre: SO, THAT IS
FROM A BLACK MALE WOLF, 1107.
>> Whitaker: ...AND THEN
SPREADING THE WORD.

21:51.276 --> 21:55.847
>> McIntyre: WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SEE A GRAY WOLF?
>> Whitaker: I WOULD LOVE TO.
>> McIntyre: OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

21:55.847 --> 21:59.618
SO, IT'S A LITTLE BIT RIGHT OF
CENTER.
>> Whitaker: OH, YEAH.
OH, LOOK, HERE COMES A WHOLE

21:59.618 --> 22:03.555
PACK.
WOW.
>> McIntyre: SO, SEE, IF YOU
COUNT THEM ALL, THERE WOULD BE

22:03.555 --> 22:07.092
TWO GRAYS--
>> Whitaker: ONE, TWO...
>> McIntyre: --AND SIX BLACKS.
>> Whitaker: ...THREE, FOUR,

22:07.092 --> 22:15.233
FIVE, SIX BLACK ONES, AND THE
WHITE ONE THAT WENT BY.
>> McIntyre: AND THERE SHOULD BE
A SECOND GRAY.

22:15.233 --> 22:22.207
>> Whitaker: HOW ABOUT THAT?
WE HAD SPOTTED THE JUNCTION
BUTTE PACK ALONG A RIDGELINE
ABOUT TWO MILES AWAY.

22:22.207 --> 22:29.247
LIKE MOST PACKS, IT'S LED BY AN
ALPHA MALE AND AN ALPHA FEMALE,
THE ONLY TWO WOLVES IN A PACK
WHO MATE, WITH EACH OTHER.

22:29.247 --> 22:33.819
>> McIntyre: THE GRAY ALPHA
FEMALE IS STILL LEADING TO THE
RIGHT.
>> Whitaker: OH, YEAH.

22:33.819 --> 22:39.524
>> McIntyre: AND YOU SEE HOW THE
ONES BEHIND HER ARE PLAYING.
SHE'S DETERMINED TO LEAD THEM TO
THE WEST.

22:39.524 --> 22:44.296
THEY'RE RUNNING ALONG THE TOP.
>> Whitaker: RIGHT ALONG THE
RIDGE, YEAH.
THAT'S MAGNIFICENT.

22:44.296 --> 22:51.770
>> Smith: WE CAN SEE THESE
WOLVES FROM THE GROUND, AND IT'S
BEEN A SENSATION.
SO WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT

22:51.770 --> 22:58.477
PACK DYNAMICS, AND
PERSONALITIES, AND-- AND HOW
SOCIAL THEY ARE.
>> Whitaker: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:58.477 --> 23:05.117
DESCRIBE THAT FOR ME.
>> Smith: THEY WANT TO BE
TOGETHER.
THEY'RE A PACK ANIMAL.

23:05.117 --> 23:11.823
SO THE POWER OF THE WOLF IS THE
PACK.
>> Whitaker: NOWHERE IS THAT
POWER MORE EVIDENT THAN WHEN A

23:11.823 --> 23:18.430
WOLF PACK IS ON THE HUNT FOR
ELK, ITS FAVORITE PREY.
THEY WORK TOGETHER, BECAUSE THEY
HAVE TO.

23:18.430 --> 23:24.803
>> Smith: YOUR AVERAGE WOLF
WEIGHS 100 POUNDS OR SO, BUT
YOUR AVERAGE PREY ANIMAL IS
MUCH BIGGER.

23:24.803 --> 23:31.409
A BULL ELK'S 750 POUNDS.
A COW ELK'S 500.
SO HOW IS A ROUGHLY 100 TO
120-POUND ANIMAL GOING TO TAKE

23:31.409 --> 23:37.883
THAT DOWN?
>> Whitaker: THEY DO IT, DOUG
SMITH SAYS, BOTH BY COORDINATING
THEIR ATTACK, AND BY ZEROING IN

23:37.883 --> 23:44.589
ON VULNERABLE PREY.
>> Smith: THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE WEAK.
SO, THEY'RE MAKING THEIR LIVING

23:44.589 --> 23:51.897
OFF OF CALF ELK, OLD ELK,
INJURED ELK.
>> Whitaker: WITHOUT WOLVES,
THERE WAS AN OVERPOPULATION OF

23:51.897 --> 23:59.471
ELK IN YELLOWSTONE.
AS WOLVES HAVE CUT THE SIZE OF
THOSE HERDS, THERE'S BEEN AN
UNEXPECTED SIDE-EFFECT: PLANTS

23:59.471 --> 24:07.212
THAT ELK FEED ON HAVE MADE A
COMEBACK, WHICH HAS IN TURN
PRODUCED BENEFITS FOR OTHER
SPECIES.

24:07.212 --> 24:13.351
>> Smith: ALL THE LITTLE TREES
HAVE COME BACK SINCE WOLF
RECOVERY.
THIS GULLY FILLED WITH SHRUBS

24:13.351 --> 24:17.189
HAS ALL COME BACK SINCE WOLF
RECOVERY.
>> Whitaker: AND THE WOLVES ARE
A FACTOR IN ALL OF THAT?

24:17.189 --> 24:24.329
>> Smith: VERY SIMPLY PUT:
WOLVES EAT ELK.
ELK EAT THIS.
WHEN THE ELK GET REDUCED, THEY

24:24.329 --> 24:30.869
EAT LESS.
SO BEAVERS AND SONG BIRDS CAN
RESPOND TO THE GROWTH AND THAT
VEGETATION.

24:30.869 --> 24:38.343
>> Whitaker: DOUG SMITH IS QUICK
TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE
AS HE JUST MADE IT SOUND.
BUT, THAT HASN'T STOPPED SOME

24:38.343 --> 24:44.783
ENVIRONMENTALISTS FROM DECLARING
WOLVES THE "SAVIORS" OF
YELLOWSTONE'S ECOLOGY.
>> Randy Newberg: THERE'S SOME

24:44.783 --> 24:51.256
PEOPLE WHO WILL TRY TO CONVINCE
YOU THAT WOLVES COULD PROBABLY
SOLVE MIDEAST PEACE AND WORLD
HUNGER.

24:51.256 --> 25:01.433
>> Whitaker: RANDY NEWBERG IS
A MONTANA HUNTER, WHO HOSTS A
TV SHOW AND PODCAST FOR HUNTERS.
HE REMEMBERS HOW EMOTIONAL THE

25:01.433 --> 25:06.071
DEBATE OVER REINTRODUCTION WAS
BETWEEN WOLF HATERS AND WOLF
LOVERS.
>> Newberg: WOLVES ARE WOLVES.

25:06.071 --> 25:10.208
THEY AREN'T THE BIG BAD WOLF,
AND THEY DON'T HAVE A RAINBOW
SHOOTING OUT THEIR ASS LIKE
EVERYONE WOULD THINK THEY DO.

25:10.208 --> 25:16.314
>> Eric Kalsta: THERE'S
SOMETHING ROMANTIC ABOUT A WOLF,
RIGHT?
UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN IT CHEWING ON

25:16.314 --> 25:24.456
A LIVE COW.
>> Whitaker: ERIK KALSTA'S
FAMILY HAS BEEN RAISING CATTLE
AND SHEEP ON THIS MONTANA RANCH

25:24.456 --> 25:30.929
FOR 100 YEARS.
HE SAYS HE WAS WORRIED FROM THE
MOMENT THE FIRST WOLVES WERE
BROUGHT BACK TO YELLOWSTONE,

25:30.929 --> 25:35.767
WHICH IS ABOUT 100 MILES TO THE
SOUTH.
>> Kalsta: YOU KNOW, THEY
WEREN'T GOING TO STAY IN THE

25:35.767 --> 25:39.304
PARK.
THEY'RE A WILD ANIMAL.
THEY'LL GO WHERE THEY WANT TO
GO.

25:39.304 --> 25:42.841
>> Whitaker: I'M SURE YOU KNEW
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY WERE GOING TO GET
HERE.

25:42.841 --> 25:48.113
>> Kalsta: OH, YES.
THERE WAS NO DOUBT.
AND THERE WAS A SET OF TRACKS...
>> Whitaker: ERIK KALSTA KNEW

25:48.113 --> 25:55.153
THAT WOLVES WOULD FOLLOW
MIGRATING ELK OUT OF YELLOWSTONE
AND ONTO HIS RANCH, AND THAT
THEY'D ATTACK HIS LIVESTOCK IF

25:55.153 --> 26:02.894
GIVEN THE CHANCE.
HE STARTED HIRING RANGE RIDERS
TO WATCH OVER HIS CATTLE, AND HE
BOUGHT GUARD DOGS TO HELP KEEP

26:02.894 --> 26:10.068
WOLVES AWAY FROM HIS SHEEP.
>> Kalsta: LIVE SHEEP PAY FOR
THINGS, LIVE CATTLE PAY FOR
THINGS.

26:10.068 --> 26:17.676
DEAD ONES DON'T.
>> Whitaker: HIS DEFENSIVE
MEASURES HAVE KEPT WOLVES AWAY
FROM HIS LIVESTOCK, BUT

26:17.676 --> 26:24.249
NEIGHBORING RANCHERS HAVE LOST
BOTH CATTLE AND SHEEP TO WOLVES.
>> Smith: THE THING THAT'S NEVER
MONITORED, WHEN I TALK TO THESE

26:24.249 --> 26:30.755
PEOPLE, IS THE LOST NIGHTS OF
SLEEP, THE NERVOUSNESS.
"I SAW A WOLF TRACK AT MY PLACE
TODAY," OR, "I ACTUALLY SAW A

26:30.755 --> 26:34.726
WOLF.
WOLVES ARE AROUND."
YOU CAN'T MEASURE OR COMPENSATE
FOR THAT.

26:34.726 --> 26:40.398
>> Whitaker: ARE WOLF ATTACKS ON
LIVESTOCK A SERIOUS PROBLEM?
>> Smith: NO, IT'S RARE THAT IT
HAPPENS.

26:40.398 --> 26:47.005
BUT IF IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU,
IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
>> Whitaker: IT WAS THAT FEAR OF
WOLF ATTACKS THAT DROVE RANCHERS

26:47.005 --> 26:56.514
AND SETTLERS TO ERADICATE THEM
IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY.
AFTER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT
WAS PASSED IN 1973, WOLVES WERE

26:56.514 --> 27:06.091
AMONG THE FIRST TO BE LISTED,
AND A CAMPAIGN BEGAN TO RESTORE
THEM TO YELLOWSTONE PARK.
AFTER THAT HAPPENED IN THE '90s,

27:06.091 --> 27:14.833
WOLVES QUICKLY SPREAD OUT OF
YELLOWSTONE AND INTO NEIGHBORING
STATES-- SO MANY, THAT THERE ARE
NOW NEARLY 2,000 IN MONTANA,

27:14.833 --> 27:24.075
WYOMING AND IDAHO.
AFTER A LONG AND BITTER LEGAL
BATTLE, THOSE STATES FINALLY WON
THE AUTHORITY TO MANAGE-- AND

27:24.075 --> 27:32.650
SOMETIMES KILL-- WOLVES OUTSIDE
THE NATIONAL PARK.
HAS THIS MANAGEMENT OF THE
WOLVES HELPED TO LESSEN SOME OF

27:32.650 --> 27:41.493
THOSE PASSIONS, TO CALM SOME OF
THOSE EMOTIONS?
>> Smith: I THINK SO.
>> Whitaker: SO TO HAVE WOLVES,

27:41.493 --> 27:46.231
YOU HAVE TO KILL THE WOLVES?
>> Smith: IN SOME SITUATIONS,
YES.
>> Whitaker: THE FIRST SITUATION

27:46.231 --> 27:53.438
IS CUT-AND-DRIED: ANY WOLVES
THAT ATTACK LIVESTOCK ARE
IMMEDIATELY KILLED THEMSELVES.
>> Kalsta: I THINK THAT'S HELPED

27:53.438 --> 27:59.310
A LOT, AT LEAST WITH THE
RANCHING COMMUNITY.
PEOPLE FEEL BETTER IF THEY'RE
NOT POWERLESS TO DEAL WITH

27:59.310 --> 28:02.947
SOMETHING.
>> Smith: AND THEN WOLVES ARE
HUNTED.
THERE'S A HUNTING SEASON ON

28:02.947 --> 28:10.522
WOLVES.
ALL THREE STATES HAVE THEM.
SO HAVING WOLVES BE HUNTED HAS
PROBABLY INCREASED PEOPLE'S

28:10.522 --> 28:15.293
WILLINGNESS TO SHARE THE
LANDSCAPE WITH THEM.
>> Newberg: IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S AT LEAST TWO OF THEM.

28:15.293 --> 28:20.298
>> Whitaker: RANDY NEWBERG IS
LIVING PROOF OF THAT.
HE FILMED A WOLF HUNT A FEW
YEARS AGO FOR HIS TV SHOW.

28:20.298 --> 28:28.740
IT TOOK HIM 11 DAYS, AND
100 MILES OF TRUDGING AND
TRACKING THROUGH THE SNOW.
YOU WENT OUT LOOKING FOR A WOLF,

28:28.740 --> 28:36.147
AND SAW HOW SMART THEY ARE, HOW
CUNNING THEY ARE, HOW ATHLETIC
THEY ARE?
>> Newberg: YEAH.

28:36.147 --> 28:43.254
IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR
RESPECT FOR WOLVES, GO AND CHASE
THEM OUT ON THEIR LANDSCAPE.
>> Whitaker: HUNTERS AND

28:43.254 --> 28:49.160
RANCHERS AND AVID WOLF-WATCHERS
RARELY SEE EYE-TO-EYE, BUT THEY
NOW AGREE ON AT LEAST ONE THING:
>> Woman: WE'VE GOT A GRAY.

28:49.160 --> 28:59.737
>> Whitaker: WOLVES ARE BACK IN
YELLOWSTONE, FOR GOOD.
>> Smith: PEOPLE LOVE THIS.
YOU KNOW, WE LIVE IN AN

28:59.737 --> 29:07.846
ARTIFICIAL WORLD.
IT'S STORES, AND CARS, AND
ROADS, AND BUILDINGS.
WOLVES ARE REAL, AND PEOPLE

29:07.846 --> 29:14.752
CRAVE IT.
THEY LOVE IT.
WE ALMOST HAVE THIS THIRST FOR
SOMETHING REAL NOW.

29:14.752 --> 29:20.492
(HOWLING )

29:24.362 --> 29:33.771
(TICKING )
>> Whitaker: JOEL SARTORE, AN
ACCLAIMED "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC"
PHOTOGRAPHER, IS A MAN ON A

29:33.771 --> 29:41.112
MISSION.
HE'S TRYING TO PHOTOGRAPH EVERY
SPECIES-- EVERY ANIMAL, BIRD,
FISH, REPTILE, AND INSECT--

29:41.112 --> 29:46.985
IN CAPTIVITY.
AS WE FIRST REPORTED BACK IN
2018, JOEL SARTORE SIDES WITH
SCIENTISTS WHO ESTIMATE THAT

29:46.985 --> 29:57.295
HALF THE SPECIES ALIVE TODAY
COULD BE EXTINCT BY THE END OF
THIS CENTURY, SO HE TRAVELS TO
ZOOS ALL AROUND THE WORLD TO

29:57.295 --> 30:02.634
TAKE PICTURES OF WHAT WE'RE
LOSING, AND TO IGNITE
CONSERVATION EFFORTS TO PREVENT
EXTINCTIONS.

30:02.634 --> 30:10.708
HE CALLS HIS PROJECT "THE PHOTO
ARK."
ON THIS ARK, THE ANIMALS GO IN
ONE BY ONE.

30:10.708 --> 30:16.781
>> Joel Sartore: HE'S BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T HE?
>> Whitaker: TO CATCH JOEL
SARTORE IN ACTION, WE FLEW

30:16.781 --> 30:24.989
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD, TO THE
PHILIPPINES, HOME TO HUNDREDS OF
UNIQUE SPECIES.
FLEW 20 HOURS TO GET HERE.

30:24.989 --> 30:30.828
AND YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY TO
TAKE A PICTURE OF A PALAWAN
STINK BADGER?
>> Joel Sartore: ABSOLUTELY!

30:30.828 --> 30:35.867
ABSOLUTELY.
BOY, IS HE STINKY.
>> Whitaker: HE'S SMALLER THAN A
SKUNK, BUT SMELLS WORSE.

30:35.867 --> 30:43.007
HE'S PART BADGER, PART SKUNK AND
HE FIRED A REEKING ROCKET--
OHHH!
--AFTER HE ENTERED THE PHOTO

30:43.007 --> 30:47.845
CAGE.
>> Joel Sartore: HOW CAN
SOMETHING THAT CUTE BE THAT
STINKY?

30:47.845 --> 30:56.120
>> Whitaker: IT SMELLED SO
TERRIBLE THAT THE NEXT ANIMAL TO
LEAVE THE RED CARPET AND HEAD
INTO THE PHOTO CAGE, A RARE

30:56.120 --> 31:06.030
PALAWAN BINTURONG, TOOK ONE
WHIFF, SMELLED STINK BADGER
STINK, AND BACKED OUT.
SARTORE SAID HE SHOULD HAVE

31:06.030 --> 31:09.934
PHOTOGRAPHED THE STINK BADGER
LAST, BUT THE LITTLE STINKER IS
A PUNGENT PRIZE.
>> Joel Sartore: THERE'S NOBODY

31:09.934 --> 31:14.505
ELSE COMING ALONG TO PHOTOGRAPH
A STINK BADGER.
I'M THE ONLY ONE.
AND THAT'S THE CASE FOR 90% OF

31:14.505 --> 31:22.380
THE SPECIES I PHOTOGRAPH, MAYBE
95%.
THESE ARE THINGS THAT NOBODY
WILL EVER KNOW EXISTED, IF IT

31:22.380 --> 31:30.355
WEREN'T FOR THE PHOTO ARK.
IF THEY COULD JUST SEE HOW
BEAUTIFUL THIS THING IS, THEY
WOULD CARE.

31:30.355 --> 31:39.097
>> Whitaker: JOEL CARES SO MUCH,
HE SPENDS HALF THE YEAR
TRAVELING THE WORLD.
WE SAW HIM WORK 12-HOUR DAYS IN

31:39.097 --> 31:45.970
STIFLING, HUMID, 100-DEGREE
HEAT.
>> Joel Sartore: OKAY, LET'S
SWITCH TO WHITE.

31:45.970 --> 31:53.811
>> Whitaker: IT WAS TOUGH FOR US
JUST WATCHING HIM BUILD POP-UP
STUDIOS, SWITCHING BETWEEN
BACKDROPS OF BLACK AND WHITE.

31:53.811 --> 32:00.418
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO USE EITHER
BLACK OR WHITE BACKGROUNDS?
>> Joel Sartore: THERE ARE NO
DISTRACTIONS IN THESE PICTURES.

32:00.418 --> 32:04.689
IT'S JUST THE ANIMAL AND YOU.
AND THAT ANIMAL'S OFTEN LOOKING
YOU IN THE EYE.
>> Whitaker: THAT'S WHEN IT ALL

32:04.689 --> 32:09.694
WORKS.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO,
WHEN JOEL TRIED TO PHOTOGRAPH A
CHIMP.

32:09.694 --> 32:14.766
HE SPENT MORE THAN AN HOUR
TAPING UP THE WHITE BACKGROUND.
>> Joel Sartore: SO NOW, DOESN'T
THIS LOOK NICE.

32:14.766 --> 32:22.840
>> Whitaker: MORE THAN AN HOUR,
FOR THIS.
(ANIMALS SCREECHING )
ANIMALS CAN BE FRUSTRATING, AND

32:22.840 --> 32:34.185
DANGEROUS, LIKE THIS FIERCE
LUZON WARTY PIG, FOUND ONLY ON A
FEW PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
HANDLERS HAD HERDED HIM INTO A

32:34.185 --> 32:42.760
MAKESHIFT PHOTO PEN.
JOEL GOT AS CLOSE AS HE DARED,
LYING IN A TROUGH USUALLY USED
FOR PIG WASTE.

32:42.760 --> 32:46.431
THE TUSKS ARE SHARP.
THE HOOVES ARE SHARP.
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH.
I, I-- YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:46.431 --> 32:52.437
I'M CONCENTRATING.
I GOT A LOT TO DO.
>> Whitaker: BEYOND THE TUSKS
AND HOOVES, THIS PIG PACKS A

32:52.437 --> 33:01.479
MEAN TEMPER.
YOU'VE HEARD THE EXPRESSION
"WHEN PIGS FLY?"
WATCH.

33:01.479 --> 33:06.517
>> Joel Sartore: LIKE A COW
JUMPING OVER THE MOON, EXCEPT IT
WAS A PIG.
LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT.

33:06.517 --> 33:10.254
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT HAPPEN,
EVER.
HE'S SHARP, YOU CAN SEE HIM.
WE'RE DONE.

33:10.254 --> 33:16.561
THAT'S GOOD.
WE GOT OUR PICTURE.
WE DON'T EVER NEED TO PHOTOGRAPH
THIS SPECIES AGAIN.

33:16.561 --> 33:23.634
>> Whitaker: BUT THEN, THERE WAS
TRIXIE, PERHAPS THE WORLD'S
SWEETEST ORANGUTAN.
WE MET HER NOT FAR FROM THE

33:23.634 --> 33:31.275
MEAN-SPIRITED PIG AT THE AVILON
ZOO OUTSIDE MANILA.
>> Joel Sartore: AND WE'RE JUST
GOING TO LET HER SEE THE FLASH.

33:31.275 --> 33:37.582
SO FAR, SO GOOD.
>> Whitaker: THE KEY QUESTION:
WOULD TRIXIE MOVE IN FRONT OF
THE WHITE BACKGROUND?

33:37.582 --> 33:41.185
>> Joel Sartore: DO YOU THINK
SHE WOULD WANT TO STAND OVER
THERE?
AND GET HER PICTURE?

33:41.185 --> 33:45.289
>> Whitaker: SHE'S AMAZING.
>> Joel Sartore: AWESOME, LOOK
AT THAT.
>> Ellen Sartore: AW, SWEET

33:45.289 --> 33:50.061
GIRL.
>> Whitaker: LIKE A COVER GIRL.
>> Joel Sartore: IF SHE LAYS
DOWN TO LOOK AT YOU, YOU GET

33:50.061 --> 33:56.601
DOWN WITH HER.
YOU JUST LAY DOWN ON THE GROUND
AT EYE LEVEL.
SHE WAS COMPLETELY CALM.

33:56.601 --> 34:01.205
>> Whitaker: LATER, SARTORE
SHOWED US HIS FAVORITE TRIXIE
SHOTS, AT "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC"
HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON.

34:01.205 --> 34:05.309
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'S
THINKING?
>> Joel Sartore: I THINK SHE WAS
JUST THINKING, YOU KNOW, "IS

34:05.309 --> 34:09.380
THERE A BANANA IN THIS SOMEWHERE
FOR ME?
(LAUGHS )
A MANGO?"

34:09.380 --> 34:18.556
LET'S GO IN THERE AND GET HER ON
BLACK.
VERY NICE, VERY NICE.
I LIKE THE WHITE ONE BETTER, I

34:18.556 --> 34:22.560
THINK.
IT'S MORE DIRECT.
IT'S MORE LIKE SHE'S INVOLVED.
SHE'S A PARTNER IN THE PROCESS.

34:22.560 --> 34:27.698
>> Whitaker: I PUT MY HAND OUT.
I WASN'T QUITE SURE SHE WAS
GOING TO TAKE IT, BUT SHE DID.
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH, IT'S

34:27.698 --> 34:33.070
SOFT.
>> Whitaker: AND IT WAS SOFT.
YEAH, THAT WAS AN AMAZING
EXPERIENCE.

34:33.070 --> 34:38.109
WHAT MAKES A GREAT PICTURE?
>> Joel Sartore: EMOTION.
THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK FOR IN ANY,
IN ANY GREAT PHOTOGRAPH.

34:38.109 --> 34:44.415
>> Whitaker: WHAT'S EMOTION IN
AN ANIMAL?
>> Joel Sartore: A MOMENT.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE EYES.

34:44.415 --> 34:48.786
HUMANS ARE, WE'RE PRIMATES, AND
WE'RE REALLY, REALLY RESPONSIVE
TO EYES.
WE'RE ALL ABOUT EYE CONTACT.

34:48.786 --> 34:52.290
>> Whitaker: BUT YOU SHOOT THEM
LIKE THEY'RE MODELS.
>> Joel Sartore: WE DO.
LIKE THEY'RE GOING IN FOR THEIR

34:52.290 --> 34:58.896
HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR PORTRAIT.
>> Whitaker: SARTORE SHOOTS
BIRDS IN TENTS SO THEY WON'T FLY
AWAY.

34:58.896 --> 35:07.972
THIS WHITE CROWNED HORNBILL
POSED LIKE A PREENING PRO.
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM JOEL'S
FIRST ATTEMPT TO SHOOT THIS

35:07.972 --> 35:13.211
SPECIES, BACK IN THE STATES.
>> READY?
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH.
SO THIS LADY, HER NAME'S JEN.

35:13.211 --> 35:19.317
NOT A BASHFUL BIRD AT ALL.
OW!
SO WHAT SHE DIDN'T TELL ME IS,
THAT BIRD IS SUCH A BADASS, HE

35:19.317 --> 35:24.355
ATTACKS HER WHEN SHE GOES IN TO
FEED HIM.
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE I'M BACK HERE.

35:24.355 --> 35:29.694
SO WHEN I SAID, "CAN YOU PUT
THAT BIRD IN MY TENT?"
SHE WENT, "SURE I CAN."
THIS IS LIKE A $6,000 CAMERA.

35:29.694 --> 35:39.203
DOESN'T HE KNOW THAT?
OW, GOD, (BLEEP )!
THAT'S MY BLOOD RIGHT THERE.
>> Whitaker: THAT'S WHY HE

35:39.203 --> 35:45.710
WANTED TO SHOOT A CALM HORNBILL
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
>> Joel Sartore: VERY NICE BIRD.
>> Whitaker: BUT HERE, THE RED

35:45.710 --> 35:51.282
RAT SNAKE KEPT ATTACKING.
>> Joel Sartore: GOD, THEY'RE
REAL LUNGE-Y, AREN'T THEY?
>> Whitaker: FORTUNATELY, HE'S

35:51.282 --> 35:58.189
NOT VENOMOUS--
>> Mark Laganga: JESUS!
>> Whitaker: --SINCE HE BIT OUR
CAMERAMAN, MARK LAGANGA.

35:58.189 --> 36:03.394
>> Joel Sartore: I ENJOY SEEING
A "60 MINUTES" CAMERAMAN GET
BIT, INSTEAD OF ME.
>> Whitaker: BUT THE NEXT SNAKE

36:03.394 --> 36:11.202
WAS EXTREMELY VENOMOUS.
>> Joel Sartore: IS THAT THE
SPITTER?
>> Whitaker: THE PALAWAN

36:11.202 --> 36:18.976
SPITTING COBRA CAN BLIND YOU IF
IT SPITS IN YOUR EYE-- AND IT
CAN SPIT TEN FEET.
THAT'S WHY JOEL WORE GOGGLES.

36:18.976 --> 36:24.749
BUT, WATCH HOW CLOSE HE GETS TO
THIS COBRA.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT WHEN THEY HAD
THEIR HOOD OUT LIKE THAT, THAT

36:24.749 --> 36:28.185
MEANT DANGER.
>> Joel Sartore: WELL, HE'S
REACTING TO US.
WE'RE LIKE SKYSCRAPERS TO THIS

36:28.185 --> 36:33.024
GUY.
SO, HE'S GOING TO STAND UP AND
LOOK AS BIG AS HE CAN.
THEY HAVE A SPACE PREPPED

36:33.024 --> 36:37.428
ALREADY.
>> Whitaker: IN ZOOS, SARTORE
CAN SHOOT MORE THAN 20 SPECIES
IN ONE DAY.

36:37.428 --> 36:46.704
IN THE WILD, IT COULD TAKE
SEVERAL DAYS TO GET ONE GOOD
SHOT.
NOW, WITH NATURAL HABITATS

36:46.704 --> 36:53.578
VANISHING, SOME SPECIES CAN ONLY
BE FOUND IN ZOOS.
>> Joel Sartore: A LOT OF THEM
ONLY EXIST IN ZOOS.

36:53.578 --> 36:58.382
THEY HAVE THESE CAPTIVE BREEDING
PROGRAMS FOR SOME OF THE RAREST
ANIMALS IN THE WORLD.
SO, WHEN PEOPLE SAY, "WELL,

36:58.382 --> 37:02.420
THEY'RE DOWN ON ZOOS," WELL,
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN A GOOD ZOO,
AND THEY DON'T KNOW THE
CONSERVATION EFFECT OF GOOD

37:02.420 --> 37:07.692
ZOOS.
>> Whitaker: SARTORE SPENT HIS
FIRST 16 YEARS AT "NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC" TAKING PICTURES IN

37:07.692 --> 37:14.699
THE FIELD.
HE SCORED NUMEROUS MAGAZINE
COVERS, AND ENDURED VARIOUS
HARDSHIPS.

37:14.699 --> 37:21.005
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH, THAT'S
ME.
THAT'S ON ALASKA'S NORTH SLOPE.
I WANTED TO SHOW THE INSECT LOAD

37:21.005 --> 37:24.809
UP THERE.
AND ALSO, I HADN'T MADE A GOOD
PICTURE IN THREE DAYS, AND SO
THE EDITORS HERE WILL SAY,

37:24.809 --> 37:28.746
"JOEL, WE CAN'T PUBLISH YOUR
EXCUSES."
>> Whitaker: THE MOSQUITOES
THOUGH, MY GOD.

37:28.746 --> 37:34.352
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH.
MY FEET ITCHED FOR A LONG TIME.
>> Whitaker: HE CAME UP WITH THE

37:34.352 --> 37:41.559
PHOTO ARK IDEA AFTER HIS WIFE
DEVELOPED BREAST CANCER.
>> Joel Sartore: THAT'S MY SON
COLE, AND MY WIFE KATHY.

37:41.559 --> 37:49.500
SHE WENT ON CHEMO FOR NINE
MONTHS, AND I WAS GROUNDED.
I WAS HOME FOR A YEAR.
AND SO, I WAS REALLY WORRIED SHE

37:49.500 --> 37:54.672
WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT.
BUT WE ALL MADE IT THROUGH.
SHE'S FINE TODAY.
IT'S BEEN 13 YEARS, WHICH IS

37:54.672 --> 37:58.376
GREAT.
>> Whitaker: WONDERFUL.
>> Joel Sartore: IT REALLY DOES
MAKE YOU APPRECIATE HOW LIMITED

37:58.376 --> 38:01.646
OUR TIME IS.
>> Whitaker: SO THE CANCER
CHANGED ALL OF YOUR LIVES.
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH.

38:01.646 --> 38:10.454
AND STARTED THE PHOTO ARK.
IT WAS A DESPERATE, LAST-DITCH
EFFORT TO USE MY LIFE FOR
SOMETHING THAT'S WORTHWHILE,

38:10.454 --> 38:15.026
SOMETHING THAT COULD SAVE
NATURE.
>> Whitaker: IN THE BIBLE, THE
ARK SAVES ALL THE CREATURES ON

38:15.026 --> 38:19.463
EARTH.
IS THAT YOUR GOAL?
>> Joel Sartore: EXACTLY.
GIDDY UP.

38:19.463 --> 38:22.933
YOU BET.
>> Whitaker: WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK YOU CAN SAVE THEM WITH A
PHOTO?

38:22.933 --> 38:27.738
>> Joel Sartore: WE CAN REACH
MORE PEOPLE NOW THAN EVER,
BECAUSE WE CAN POST TO "NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC," INSTAGRAM AND

38:27.738 --> 38:36.047
FACEBOOK, AND REACH OVER
100 MILLION PEOPLE, AND DO IT
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
>> Whitaker: HIS LATEST PICTURES

38:36.047 --> 38:45.089
ARE PUBLISHED PERIODICALLY, AND
THEY'VE APPEARED ON THE EMPIRE
STATE BUILDING, AND THE VATICAN.
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH, THE SIDE

38:45.089 --> 38:49.560
OF ST. PETER'S BASILICA.
THE POPE WAS SITTING THERE
WATCHING IT, WHICH WAS AWESOME.
>> Whitaker: WE FLEW WITH JOEL

38:49.560 --> 38:55.032
TO THE PHILLIPINE ISLAND OF
NEGROS.
HERE, VAST FORESTS WERE CUT FOR
TIMBER, ROBBING WILDLIFE OF

38:55.032 --> 39:00.137
ITAL HABITAT.
>> Joel Sartore: NOW THERE'S
HARDLY ANY LOWLAND FOREST LEFT,
LESS THAN 5% HERE.

39:00.137 --> 39:06.343
>> Whitaker: NEGROS HAS ITS OWN
TYPE OF CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
WARTY PIG.
THIS MOTHER WAS SAVED FROM A

39:06.343 --> 39:12.950
HUNTER'S SNARE.
IN THE ZOO, SHE'S HELPING TO
SAVE HER SPECIES.
>> Joel Sartore: SHE'S GOT HER

39:12.950 --> 39:18.155
BABIES.
AND YOU SEE THAT BRIDLE MARKING
ON HER SNOUT?
THAT'S REALLY DEFINITIVE.

39:18.155 --> 39:22.126
>> Whitaker: OH YEAH, OH YEAH,
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
>> Joel Sartore: I THINK THESE
ARE GOING BE ON THE GROUND.

39:22.126 --> 39:28.232
>> Whitaker: JOEL, WHO SPENDS SO
MUCH TIME AWAY FROM HOME,
BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER ELLEN ON
THIS TRIP.

39:28.232 --> 39:31.736
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT
HE'S DOING?
>> Ellen Sartore: I THINK IT'S
EXTRAORDINARY, WHAT YOU'RE

39:31.736 --> 39:34.405
DOING.
>> Joel Sartore: REALLY?
>> Ellen Sartore: I DO.
>> Joel Sartore: AW.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.941
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME CRY.
>> Ellen Sartore: DON'T CRY!
>> Joel Sartore: I'VE NEVER
HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

39:36.941 --> 39:39.110
YOU DO?
>> Ellen Sartore: YEAH.
>> Whitaker: BUT HE IS GONE ALL
THE TIME?

39:39.110 --> 39:43.981
>> Ellen Sartore: HE HASN'T BEEN
TO THE LAST SEVEN OF MY
BIRTHDAYS, JUST BECAUSE MY
BIRTHDAY IS IN MIGRATION SEASON.

39:43.981 --> 39:47.184
SO, HE'S--
>> Whitaker: MIGRATION SEASON?
(LAUGHS )
>> Joel Sartore: IT'S TRUE.

39:47.184 --> 39:51.889
>> Whitaker: SO THAT'S A
BIRTHDAY BUSTER.
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH.
>> Whitaker: THE NEXT DAY,

39:51.889 --> 39:56.160
SARTORE SHOWED US A BEETLE HE
HAD SPOTTED.
>> Joel Sartore: I THINK HE'D BE
WORTH PUTTING IN THE PHOTO ARK.

39:56.160 --> 39:59.263
>> Whitaker: A SPECIES HE HADN'T
SHOT BEFORE.
SO THERE'S NOTHING TOO SMALL FOR
YOU, HUH?

39:59.263 --> 40:04.468
>> Joel Sartore: NOTHING TOO
SMALL-- IF YOU CAN SEE IT WITH
YOUR EYES, WE'LL PHOTOGRAPH IT.
>> Whitaker: OW BIG IS THIS

40:04.468 --> 40:08.372
GUY?
>> Joel Sartore: OH, THAT GUY IS
THE SIZE OF A GRAIN OF RICE.
>> Whitaker: TINY.

40:08.372 --> 40:12.943
>> Joel Sartore: YEAH, TINY.
>> Whitaker: SO EVERY ANIMAL
FILLS UP YOUR FRAME?
>> Joel Sartore: THAT'S RIGHT.

40:12.943 --> 40:17.314
>> Whitaker: SMALL OR LARGE.
>> Joel Sartore: HE'S AS BIG AS
A POLAR BEAR.
>> Whitaker: WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

40:17.314 --> 40:21.418
>> Joel Sartore: BECAUSE IT
GIVES THEM ALL EQUAL SAY, EQUAL
VOICE.
THE BIG CHARISMATIC MAMMALS GET

40:21.418 --> 40:26.323
ALL THE INK.
THEY GET ALL THE PRESS, THE
GORILLAS AND THE RHINOS AND THE
TIGERS.

40:26.323 --> 40:33.964
NOBODY'S THINKING ABOUT THESE
LITTLE GUYS.
I AM.
>> Whitaker: SARTORE SHOT

40:33.964 --> 40:39.136
ANOTHER LITTLE GUY, BELIEVED TO
BE THE VERY LAST MEMBER OF A
NOW-EXTINCT SPECIES.
>> Joel Sartore: THAT'S THE LAST

40:39.136 --> 40:46.243
RABBS FRINGE LIMBED FROG.
>> Whitaker: WHAT'S THAT LIKE,
KNOWING THAT THIS ANIMAL WILL
NOT EXIST ANYMORE, SHORTLY AFTER

40:46.243 --> 40:49.313
YOU TAKE THE PICTURE?
>> Joel Sartore: WELL, DOES IT
MAKE ME SAD?
SURE.

40:49.313 --> 40:54.485
BUT DOES IT INSPIRE ME TO GO OUT
AND KEEP WORKING LIKE I DO?
ABSOLUTELY.
