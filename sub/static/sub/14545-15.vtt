<i>Chatswin is the silly trend</i>

It's <i>Ms.</i> Royce now, Javier.

<i>And the latest trend...</i>

00:30.183 --> 00:32.183
(Singsongy)
I'm divorced, y'all.

00:35.672 --> 00:37.556

Aah. Aah.

00:44.497 --> 00:45.464
(Jill) Noah.

00:45.498 --> 00:46.782
Yes, my love.

00:46.816 --> 00:49.468
I asked you to fix
the damn shower head.

00:49.502 --> 00:53.005
Fix the shower head, Noah.

00:53.039 --> 00:54.373
Jill, you're bleeding!

00:54.407 --> 00:55.808
Fix it.

00:55.842 --> 00:57.709
(George) So did you fix it?

00:57.744 --> 00:59.277
I don't know how to fix it!

00:59.295 --> 01:01.146
I'm a tooth guy.
If, uh, if the shower had

01:01.181 --> 01:04.248
a receding gumline
or... or an abscess...

01:04.284 --> 01:05.784
You know, she should have
married a plumber.

01:05.818 --> 01:06.752
So call someone.

01:06.786 --> 01:08.353
Let her call somebody,
all right?

01:08.388 --> 01:09.655
Or... or let her use
the upstairs shower.

01:09.689 --> 01:11.607
Noah, come on, man.

01:11.641 --> 01:13.459
She asked you to fix it.
Just fix it.

01:13.493 --> 01:15.415
You know what?
I asked her to fix dinner last week,

01:15.416 --> 01:16.745
but evidently she's
a modern woman.

01:16.796 --> 01:18.997
She doesn't cook.
She doesn't clean.

01:19.032 --> 01:20.682
She doesn't climax.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.000
Listen to me, man.

01:22.035 --> 01:23.368
Sometimes they say
they're upset about one thing,

01:23.403 --> 01:25.104
but they're really upset
about something else entirely,

01:25.138 --> 01:28.207
so just don't give her
any excuses.

01:28.241 --> 01:29.341
Excuses for what?

01:29.375 --> 01:30.776
Just fix the shower head.

03:09.706 --> 03:12.274
This should be

Take your time, doctor.
Money's no object.

03:15.044 --> 03:16.912
We're not paid by the hour.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.947
Well, even if you were,
I would say,

03:18.982 --> 03:20.949
take all the time
that you need.

03:20.984 --> 03:23.952
She's worth every penny.

03:23.987 --> 03:26.288
Our main concern is that
the break heals cleanly,

03:26.322 --> 03:29.691
so we'll rebreak the nose
and set it properly.

03:29.726 --> 03:32.161
That said, there could be
some residual bruising.

03:32.195 --> 03:35.664
Okay. Honey,
since you're going under,

03:35.698 --> 03:38.567
is there anything else
you want to have done?

03:39.569 --> 03:44.473

03:44.507 --> 03:50.179

pre, post, or mid-op?

03:59.889 --> 04:01.423
(Nasal voice) I had
an accident in the shower.

04:01.457 --> 04:03.892
<i>No.</i>
I am sorry to hear that.

04:03.927 --> 04:08.730
I must say, Dallas, that sounded
uncharacteristically sincere.

04:08.765 --> 04:11.300
What exactly did you
have done?

04:11.334 --> 04:14.136
I went up a half a cup size
to celebrate the divorce.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.337
You're positively glowing.

04:15.371 --> 04:18.589
Well, I also had
a dash of botulism,

04:18.625 --> 04:21.875
a few squirts of collagen,
a handful of lowlights,

04:21.894 --> 04:23.378
and a gelicure,

04:23.413 --> 04:25.447
but primarily
it's the divorce.

04:25.481 --> 04:28.417
Leaving Steven has done
<i>wonders</i> for me.

04:28.451 --> 04:31.353
I haven't felt this good
in years. Bye, Jill!

04:49.171 --> 04:50.639
Well, this is
an unexpected delight.

04:50.673 --> 04:52.824
(Both)
You talk like our grandmother.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.043
She calls things "marvelous."

04:55.078 --> 04:57.646
Are you seeing this?
She wasn't joking.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.549
What a sellout.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.317
(Malik) I'll talk some sense
into her at practice.

05:02.352 --> 05:04.186
We're working on a routine
for the school dance.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.504
We rehearse every night.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.055
Well, except
for Wednesday nights,

05:07.090 --> 05:08.957
because that's when
the "medium" fan club meets

05:08.992 --> 05:11.059
to reenact scenes
from the TV show "medium."

05:11.094 --> 05:16.031
Malik, I <i>know.</i>
Okay. (Sighs) Stay calm.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.200
The most important thing here
is not to give Dalia

05:18.234 --> 05:20.469
the satisfaction of knowing
she's getting to me.

05:20.536 --> 05:22.471
Smart...

05:22.522 --> 05:23.972
But she's definitely
getting to you.

05:24.007 --> 05:25.941
- Shut up, Malik.
- Just sayin'.

05:25.975 --> 05:27.809
You and me are like
twins, Lisa.

05:27.844 --> 05:30.746
We both have
long, blonde hair,

05:30.780 --> 05:33.699
we both have names that start
with the letter "D,"

05:33.750 --> 05:38.674
and we both hate Tessa Altman,

05:38.675 --> 05:39.987
right?

(Ball bounces)

05:50.640 --> 05:52.224
Oh. (Clears throat)

05:52.259 --> 05:55.411
You'd better talk
to your girl Dallas.

05:55.445 --> 05:56.929
She's out of control.

05:56.963 --> 05:58.414
What are you talking about?

05:58.448 --> 06:01.100
She's filling Jill's head
full of these crazy ideas.

06:01.151 --> 06:02.952
I thought those two hated
each other.

06:02.986 --> 06:03.953
Not anymore.
Ever since their surgeries,

06:03.987 --> 06:05.271
it's like they've bonded.

06:05.305 --> 06:06.955
Now they talk everynight
on the phone

06:06.973 --> 06:10.526
about Dallas'
hot, new boyfriend Yoni.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.243
- Yoni?
- Yeah.

06:12.244 --> 06:13.907
Some young Latin dude.

06:13.942 --> 06:16.543
Does reiki.
I met him. Real trim.

06:16.578 --> 06:17.878
I don't trust him.

06:17.912 --> 06:18.879
How trim?

06:18.913 --> 06:20.080
Noticeably trim.

06:20.098 --> 06:21.465
- Ah.
- And another thing...

06:21.516 --> 06:24.751
He says he can <i>heal</i> energy
with his hands.

06:24.786 --> 06:27.638
Jill says she wants him
to "work on her."

06:27.672 --> 06:29.006
I wouldn't let him
work on her.

06:29.057 --> 06:30.240
Why can't Dallas deal
with her divorce

06:30.275 --> 06:32.609
the way you did... curling up
into a little ball

06:32.660 --> 06:34.378
and screeching like
a wounded an...

06:34.412 --> 06:35.629
(Thuds)
(Strained voice) Ohh!

06:35.663 --> 06:37.047
I'm just sayin'. (Sighs)

06:37.081 --> 06:39.433
(High-pitched voice)
And it's in! Ohh!

06:43.388 --> 06:46.240
(Gasps) There's the man
I was hoping to see.

06:46.274 --> 06:48.709
(Spanish accent)
There is my crystal queen.

06:48.743 --> 06:50.244
Give me sugars.

06:50.278 --> 06:51.461
(Door closes)
Mm.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.545
Mm.
Mm.

06:52.564 --> 06:54.481
Mm-hmm.
Mm. Mm. (Chuckles)

06:54.515 --> 06:56.717
I have an incandescent
lighting fixture.

06:56.751 --> 06:59.503
Oh. Thank you, George.
Just go do your thing.

06:59.554 --> 07:01.138
And I go do mine.

07:01.189 --> 07:05.058
(Yoni and Dallas moaning)

07:05.093 --> 07:08.862
(Dallas) Ohh. Yoni! (Chuckles)
That is too much tongue.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.364
(Yoni) Not in my country.

07:10.398 --> 07:11.832
(Objects clatters)
"Yoni." (Sighs)

07:12.834 --> 07:14.501
Did you call to me?

07:14.519 --> 07:17.371
What? No. I just, uh...
Wh-where'd you two say you met?

07:17.405 --> 07:19.773
Yoni's doing a reiki unit
with the junior class.

07:19.791 --> 07:21.341
We met once upon
the gymnasium.

07:21.376 --> 07:23.477
And it felt love at first sight.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.711
It felt that to me, too.

07:24.746 --> 07:26.480
So just, uh,
a complete disregard

07:26.514 --> 07:28.315
for the English language
with you two, huh?

07:28.349 --> 07:31.218
His energy is cloudy,
like the winter in <i>Ro-mah-nia.</i>

07:31.252 --> 07:32.502
"Ro-mah-nia"?

07:33.108 --> 07:34.509
Oh, you think because
I'm from South America,

07:34.543 --> 07:36.978
I cannot reference
Eastern Europe?

07:37.012 --> 07:39.214
(Lowered voice)
George, you're being rude.

07:39.248 --> 07:40.715
(Lowered voice) I see you
didn't waste any time.

07:40.749 --> 07:43.017
Back in the saddle, huh?
(Gasps)

07:43.052 --> 07:44.285
Ride 'em, Ms. Royce.

07:45.571 --> 07:48.857
Yoni, would you mind stepping
outside for a moment

07:48.891 --> 07:51.593
so I can express my irritation
with George in private?

07:51.627 --> 07:52.760
(Yoni) Please be brief.

07:52.795 --> 07:54.829
For every second
we don't be together,

07:54.864 --> 07:56.497
my heart screams for you.

07:56.532 --> 07:57.765
And mine, you, <i>yoh-nee.</i>

07:57.783 --> 07:58.833
- Yoni.
- Yoni.

07:58.868 --> 08:00.418
(Whistles)

08:00.452 --> 08:02.303
Yakult, let's go.
(Barks)

08:02.338 --> 08:03.638
Yakult, you can stay.

08:03.672 --> 08:04.739
(Whines)

08:06.308 --> 08:08.142
I said, "let's go," Yakult.

08:08.177 --> 08:09.744
Yakult!
(Whines)

08:09.778 --> 08:11.246
On your bed, girl.

08:11.280 --> 08:16.534
(Whines)

08:16.569 --> 08:17.919
(Barks)

08:18.853 --> 08:21.755
I did not have
a white leash anyways.

08:23.908 --> 08:26.126
Why'd you have to drag
Yakult into this?

08:26.160 --> 08:27.578
The divorce has been hard
enough on her.

08:27.612 --> 08:28.946
(Door closes)
Dallas, who is that clown?

08:28.980 --> 08:31.081
How old is he? And what is
with the all white?

08:31.099 --> 08:32.950
You two have to dress
in all white, is that it?

08:32.984 --> 08:34.985
It is
the color of positivity,

08:35.019 --> 08:37.554
and you're just jealous
because we pop.

08:37.572 --> 08:39.256
- We pop, George, and you don't.
- I pop.

08:39.289 --> 08:41.525
I will thank you to remember
that I'm not a child.

08:41.558 --> 08:43.943
I am
a full-grown woman, George.

08:43.995 --> 08:45.862
Full-grown!
And I don't need you

08:45.896 --> 08:48.532
telling me
what or whom to do.

08:50.702 --> 08:53.837
No. You know what? This is
my dazzling crystal emporium.

08:53.871 --> 08:56.039
You leave!

09:00.895 --> 09:02.212
(Door slams)

09:08.897 --> 09:10.097
Oh. Hello, Dalia.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.066
Are you looking for the comfort
of a stable home?

09:12.100 --> 09:13.801
Or for Ryan?
Because he's at practice.

09:13.835 --> 09:15.336

09:16.371 --> 09:18.856

Lisa. The girl one?

09:18.890 --> 09:21.042
You leave Lisa alone.

09:21.076 --> 09:22.343
She never did anything
to anyone.

(Normal voice) You ready?

09:30.742 --> 09:31.792

09:31.843 --> 09:33.093
Ready.

09:33.128 --> 09:34.628

all your homework?

09:34.679 --> 09:36.063
No.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.881
You can do it later then.
(Chuckles)

09:37.899 --> 09:39.316
She has no curfew.

that buttery?

10:43.139 --> 10:44.439
Noah, I'm leaving you.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.662

10:45.696 --> 10:47.647

within the ash family.

10:47.673 --> 10:48.838
I'm going to stay

10:48.868 --> 10:50.642

10:50.728 --> 10:51.851
(Chuckles) Dallas. Okay.

10:52.190 --> 10:54.825

pull something like this.

10:54.844 --> 10:57.116
Dallas isn't
to blame, Noah. You are.

10:57.164 --> 10:59.398
Yoni tried to heal

10:59.604 --> 11:00.804
He said you're toxic.

11:01.768 --> 11:03.486

11:03.520 --> 11:04.437
He's from South America.

11:04.471 --> 11:06.705
- He also said you're constipating.
- Constipating?

11:06.740 --> 11:08.607
According to Yoni, yes.

11:08.642 --> 11:11.488
Yes, you are, and it makes
perfect sense to me.

11:11.543 --> 11:14.483
I partake in a diet
that is <i>very</i> high in fiber,

11:14.530 --> 11:16.129
yet I seldom see results.

11:16.182 --> 11:19.201
You think you're gonna go
more without this guy?

11:19.235 --> 11:20.268
(Dish clinks and rattles)

11:20.303 --> 11:21.844
Well, let me tell you
something.

11:22.505 --> 11:25.040
You're not
a regular girl, Jill!

11:25.379 --> 11:27.247
You never have been.
You never will be.

11:27.683 --> 11:28.750
Good-bye, Noah.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.552
Fine. I'm fine with that. Fine.
(Wheels rattle, door slams)

11:32.742 --> 11:35.644
He's been like this for hours.
The... the tears come and go.

11:35.686 --> 11:37.087
(Voice breaking)
Constipating?

11:37.222 --> 11:40.691
I mean, how can another person
<i>be</i> constipating?

11:40.766 --> 11:43.367
Where were you? I had
a court reserved and everything.

11:43.566 --> 11:44.833

A.J., my wife left me,
okay?!

11:48.504 --> 11:49.904
I don't need it
from you today!

11:50.009 --> 11:51.109

11:51.135 --> 11:53.231

I haven't been there?

12:04.357 --> 12:05.357
I've been there.

12:05.427 --> 12:08.186
I went through a similar thing with
this girl from my Hebrew school,

12:08.305 --> 12:09.864
but did I lay on the bottom bunk

12:09.865 --> 12:11.471
and cry my fat little eyes out?

12:11.722 --> 12:12.870
Absolutely not.

12:13.057 --> 12:15.059
I went on the field
trip, as scheduled,

12:15.216 --> 12:16.830
and held hands with
her best friend.

12:17.299 --> 12:19.929
What happened? Did it work?
Did you get her back?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.034
Let's just say this visor
I'm wearing is from her.

12:22.065 --> 12:24.222
Okay, that... that is
a pretty sweet visor, but...

12:24.280 --> 12:26.117
I don't know if you can tell
from where you're standing,

12:26.118 --> 12:27.052
but the accents are leather.

12:27.134 --> 12:28.558
Leather. George.

12:28.605 --> 12:31.815
Yeah, I-I'm not sure you should be
taking marital advice from A.J.

12:31.849 --> 12:33.983
Do <i>you</i> have
any better ideas?

12:34.001 --> 12:35.685
Yeah, do you, George?

12:36.261 --> 12:38.688
<i>Maybe A.J. was on to something.</i>

12:38.941 --> 12:41.108

17:34.305 --> 17:36.540
<i>In life,</i>
<i>there are firefighters</i>

17:36.574 --> 17:37.924
<i>and there are arsonists,</i>

17:37.975 --> 17:40.911
<i>and if you don't want</i>
<i>to watch it all burn down,</i>

17:40.945 --> 17:43.930
<i>you'd better know how</i>
<i>to put out a blaze.</i>

17:43.981 --> 17:45.869
Thanks for letting me stay.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.986
Are you sure
that Dalia won't mind?

17:48.105 --> 17:50.103
Mind? She won't even know
you were here.

17:50.154 --> 17:51.421
There's
a school dance tonight,

17:51.456 --> 17:53.657
so she won't be home
till morning, if at all.

17:53.691 --> 17:55.955
Would you like to wear one
of her tiaras to bed?

17:57.481 --> 18:00.182
Oh. Oh, I shouldn't.

18:00.331 --> 18:01.983
(Noah, amplified voice)
Mrs. Jill Werner,

18:02.725 --> 18:04.534
are you in there?

18:04.569 --> 18:09.090
Is my wife, Mrs. Jill Werner,
in there?

18:09.299 --> 18:13.228
Mrs. Jill Werner,
are you in there?

18:13.306 --> 18:14.261
(Whinnies)

18:14.568 --> 18:17.070
Noah, what the hell
are you doing?

18:17.095 --> 18:20.083
I fixed the showerhead!
(Dogs barking in distance)

18:20.101 --> 18:23.064
And now I'm here to sweep you
off your feet.

18:23.086 --> 18:24.053
(Gasps)

18:24.361 --> 18:26.329
Where did you get
that horse?

18:26.504 --> 18:29.563
I, uh, it's... never mind.

18:30.166 --> 18:33.041
Now we will go
to our castle,

18:33.781 --> 18:35.727
and I will take you
upstairs

18:36.124 --> 18:37.649
and make love to you,

18:38.479 --> 18:40.380
and you are going
to let me...

18:40.454 --> 18:41.788
(Mouths word)
And afterwards,

18:41.806 --> 18:43.741
you're going
to make me a sandwich!

18:43.837 --> 18:45.777
He still thinks
he's calling the shots.

18:46.253 --> 18:48.833
Steven would have never ridden
a horse for me...

18:48.929 --> 18:50.921
(Voice breaks) And we had one.
But...

18:51.448 --> 18:53.308
No "buts" about it,
Jill Werner.

18:53.473 --> 18:54.743
You get your skinny ass
up there

18:54.757 --> 18:57.342
on that horse,
or I'll do it for you.

18:57.698 --> 18:59.365
That man loves you.

19:06.330 --> 19:08.398
(Sighs)

19:08.432 --> 19:09.566
(Whinnies)

19:10.508 --> 19:13.127
<i>Chivalry was alive and well</i>
<i>in Chatswin.</i>

19:13.938 --> 19:15.184
<i>As it turns out...</i>

19:15.266 --> 19:17.567
I'll have a small vanilla
with mango to go.

19:17.601 --> 19:18.729
You got it.

19:19.716 --> 19:21.667
<i>It may have become</i>
<i>the latest trend.</i>

19:21.811 --> 19:23.728
I'll...
I'll pay for hers, too.

19:24.882 --> 19:26.202
Thanks.

19:26.551 --> 19:27.764
(Indistinct conversations)

19:27.976 --> 19:30.476
Hi. I'll have
a small vanilla with mango.

19:30.767 --> 19:32.299
Uh, yours has already been
paid for.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.213
It has? By whom?

19:35.028 --> 19:37.872
(Angus & Julia Stone)
♪ I wish I had a mango tree

19:39.430 --> 19:42.540
♪ in my backyard

19:44.110 --> 19:47.804
♪ with you standing next to me

19:48.784 --> 19:52.151
♪ take the picture

19:53.004 --> 19:56.418
♪ 'cause from her lips
I heard her say ♪

19:57.583 --> 19:59.000
(Boxes clatter)

19:59.317 --> 20:02.586
(Siren whoops,
police radio chatter)

20:02.620 --> 20:04.738
(Strained voice)
I learned something tonight.

20:04.789 --> 20:05.764
What's that?

20:05.802 --> 20:08.887
Don't try to beat
a yellow light on horseback.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.795
Right. Thank you
for breaking my fall.

20:11.829 --> 20:13.738
I would break every bone
in my body for you.

20:13.776 --> 20:15.090
I hope you know that.

20:15.142 --> 20:17.955
You could have just fixed
the shower instead.

20:18.817 --> 20:19.817
(Kisses)

20:19.852 --> 20:21.853
One more on my mouth.

20:22.838 --> 20:25.642
Come on, you hard-ass!
One more on my mouth.

20:26.543 --> 20:27.710
Mm.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.285
(Horse blusters)

20:29.822 --> 20:31.751
I love you, woman!

20:32.481 --> 20:34.049
I love you, too.

20:34.247 --> 20:35.814
Oh, if you want to do
any sprucing up

20:35.857 --> 20:39.042
while you're under,
now's the time to say so!

20:39.269 --> 20:42.174
<i>After our trial separation,</i>
<i>i had to admit,</i>

20:42.276 --> 20:43.493
<i>it was nice to have Lisa back.</i>

20:43.527 --> 20:45.695
Her room smells like
newborn babies.

20:45.730 --> 20:47.932
- I've been in there.It doesn't.
- It did to me.

20:48.088 --> 20:50.773
Look, I know that you guys
are probably still mad at me

20:50.796 --> 20:52.245
for going to hang
with Dalia,

20:52.292 --> 20:53.737
but I just want to say

20:53.747 --> 20:55.479
that if I had to do it
all over again,

20:56.540 --> 20:58.408
I would still go hang
with Dalia,

20:58.442 --> 21:00.364
because I know you guys
are my real friends,

21:00.401 --> 21:02.544
and real friends can take
each other for granted.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.030
She's joking, right?

21:04.190 --> 21:05.922
(Chuckles) Of course.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.887
Now go get me something
to drink.
