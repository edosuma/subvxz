03:52.982 --> 03:55.026
you picked such a convenient location.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.278
[laughing]

03:57.362 --> 03:58.562
Manuel says you've been asking

03:58.613 --> 04:00.490
to meet with me
every week for the last year.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.700
So now we meet.

What is it you want?

04:04.577 --> 04:06.412
I wanna buy directly from you.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.790
I only sell directly to a few people.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.111
People I know that can handle it.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.086
I own the ports in Montreal,
as you know.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.004
It's the gateway to the entire Northeast.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.632
Nothing comes in or goes out
without my approval,

04:17.714 --> 04:19.091
so I can handle it.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.470
That would put you
in a very high position.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.264
You would control the market up there.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.602
But why do you need the added aggravation?
You want more money?

04:30.853 --> 04:31.688
No.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.857
- What else is there?
- Do you answer to anyone?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.318
No.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.157
<i>That </i> is what I want.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.998
Manuel... is my cousin. Did you know that?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.833
- [Declan] I did.
- Of course you did!

04:51.916 --> 04:54.419
Manuelito likes to tell everyone
that he's my cousin!

04:54.502 --> 04:57.130

You're making me look like an idiot...

04:57.213 --> 04:58.131
It's okay!

04:58.214 --> 05:00.717
It's okay, Manuelito. I understand.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.677
[in Spanish]
When you're not important,

05:02.760 --> 05:05.388
you have to tell people that
you know someone important.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.100
[in English]
Of course, we did our research on you.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.813
I don't meet with just anyone.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.690
No, I wouldn't think you do.

05:15.773 --> 05:19.235
And you are as he says,
<i>profesional, </i> focused.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.113
You had all that whole mess
with the Mafia to deal with,

05:22.196 --> 05:24.449
and now
you are the strongest in your city.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.868
Myself,
I didn't like dealing with the Italians.

05:26.951 --> 05:30.621
They pay on time,
but they look down on us.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.083
Anyway, while we were looking into you,

05:34.792 --> 05:36.586
we discovered that we were short payments

05:36.669 --> 05:39.213
on some of the shipments
that you bought through Manuel.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.217
[Jorge] Can you explain that?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.471
- No.
- Are you sure?

05:48.473 --> 05:51.267
I don't short anyone, ever.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.227
No, you don't.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.408
It was Manuel that was stealing from them,

05:55.897 --> 05:58.441
which means he was also stealing from you.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.004
[in Spanish] What's going on, cousin?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.628
I already told you it was that bastard!

06:01.652 --> 06:03.780
You can't believe that I was stealing...

06:03.863 --> 06:05.448
[gunshot echoing]

06:07.450 --> 06:09.285
[Jorge] We will do business with you.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.788
One hundred kilos to start.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.790
That's five million US.

06:13.873 --> 06:17.210
Most don't have the cash to pay
for such a large shipment up front,

06:17.293 --> 06:19.712
so you'll have seven days
to come up with my money.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.715
Not a problem.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.386
And if you can handle more,
then we will increase from month to month.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.388
- Sound good?
- Good.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.138

a long time, amigo.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.404
You know what will happen to you.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.906
Manuel, he was family,

06:46.989 --> 06:48.825
and you don't make family suffer.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.704
You're not family.

- Allergies.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.870
Since when you got allergies?

09:39.954 --> 09:43.165
- Since lately.
- Don't start. You don't got no allergies.

09:43.624 --> 09:44.709
It's a great comfort to me

If you want,
I can check your prostate, too.

Dairy's really bad for you.
I cut out all dairy. I feel great.

- Almond milk.

Dom, what's happening?
What are we doing here?

10:02.685 --> 10:05.247
The families back home told me
to work with 'em. That's all I know.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.631
Would you stop saying "back home"?

10:06.689 --> 10:08.733
You've been here for 50 years.
This is home!

10:08.816 --> 10:10.151

He's the only one born in Italy,
he likes to hold it over us.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.326
- So give it to him.
- It's like the vampires.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.619
Vampires?

10:19.702 --> 10:22.913
Yeah. The original vampires
are the real vampires.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.037
They got pure blood.
The ones that have been turned,

10:25.082 --> 10:28.294
you see, the people that get bit
and turn into vampires,

10:28.377 --> 10:31.255
they're lower on the totem pole.
They don't have original blood.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.716
So now I'm... What, I'm a vampire?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.801
No, Pop, that's not what I meant.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.472
- What I meant is you're the OG vampire.
- [Enzo] Would you shut up already?

10:39.555 --> 10:42.576
- Domenic, you're not telling us anything.
- I'm telling you everything I know.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.770
- They're here to help expand business.
- My business or their business?

10:45.853 --> 10:48.272
Enzo, please. Let's take a beat.
They're gonna get here soon.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.817
Why don't we eat a bit before we look like
a bunch of cows in front of them? Okay?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.254
Thanks for dressing up for the occasion.
That's nice of you.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.364

- This is a $135 sweater.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.074
I got this in Milan!

10:58.157 --> 11:00.797
- It's the only thing I own.
- [Domenic] Forget it. Let's just eat.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.330
I have a CI who told me about the meeting.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.267
Every month, the families gather
to report on their businesses,

11:22.139 --> 11:23.699
- [camera clicking]
- [Ken] Who is that?

11:24.392 --> 11:26.310
I have no idea.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.605
- [Enzo] <i>So the capos don't trust us?</i>
- [Domenic] <i>Of course they do.</i>

11:31.190 --> 11:32.233
So why send someone?

11:32.316 --> 11:33.609
I don't know, Enz.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.778
Maybe the organization is changing.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.614
Yeah. You're the one taking orders now.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.575
[Luca] Hmm. They're here.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.705
[Domenic] Oh, look who's early!

11:46.247 --> 11:47.790
<i>Benvenuto, </i> Christian.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.250
<i>Ciao, </i> Domenic.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.170
- Teresa, <i>benvenuto.
- Grazie.</i>

11:54.255 --> 11:57.800
I'm Domenic. I welcome you
with the same respect I would your father.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.720
You know, he was very kind to my mother
after my father passed.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.263
I'm never gonna forget that.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.015
Our father loved your father very much.

12:05.099 --> 12:08.602
He still remembers you
as the smartest little boy in the village.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.440
Let me introduce you to everyone.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.817
You know. Then you guys can have
something to eat.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.736
Nonna made her famous pasta.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.071
Actually, we already ate, but thank you.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.031
- I'm Enzo.
- Enzo.

12:22.283 --> 12:25.619
[Bullock] <i>No one sits in
on the meetings. No one.</i>

12:26.328 --> 12:27.830
It's only for the bosses.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.915
Well, I guess they must be bosses, too.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.669
No. I've been on the 'Ndrangheta
for three years.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.005
I know who's who in Ontario.

12:36.088 --> 12:39.467
[Nellie] Way too young. They're outsiders.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.762
It was a difficult loss for everyone
when Toto was murdered.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.682
But, Domenic, you've done a wonderful job
running yours

12:46.766 --> 12:49.101
- and his territory since then.
- Thank you.

12:49.185 --> 12:53.647
Let me assure you, we are not here
to take anything away. Quite the opposite.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.733
We are here to help us all grow.

12:56.317 --> 13:00.279
Our organization has grown exponentially
over the last ten years.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.948
We now control 80%

13:03.032 --> 13:05.743
of the European cocaine and heroin market.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.912
- Oh!
<i>- Salute!</i>

13:09.914 --> 13:13.083
[Christian] But we see
even greater things ahead for all of us.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.711
And that is why our father
sent Teresa and I here.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.464
We have a simple three-part plan

13:18.547 --> 13:21.217
to get your drug business
back on track to where it should be.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.054
Expand territory, diversify product,

13:25.387 --> 13:26.680
increase local profits.

13:28.182 --> 13:31.769
[Teresa] Times have changed.
Business has changed.

13:31.852 --> 13:36.190
We live in the world of Amazon, Apple.

13:36.273 --> 13:39.568
To thrive, you must be the only option

13:39.652 --> 13:42.488
to consumers, suppliers,
and everyone in-between.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.950
You either own it all, or you own nothing.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.078
- Exactly what I've been saying.
- Luca!

13:50.162 --> 13:51.956
This time next year,

13:52.039 --> 13:54.583
we will be moving
ten times as much product.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.126
[Enzo] Ten times?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.587
We already supply most of Ontario
with what we're moving.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.071
What are we gonna do with all that?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.715
Expand.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.675
To Montreal.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.926
[chuckling]

14:05.177 --> 14:06.177
Okay.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.223
- What's the problem?
- Declan.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.351
- [Christian] The one who killed Toto.
- And Vito.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.436
Look, the papers said it was, uh,

14:15.437 --> 14:16.480
natural causes.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.192
Declan, he wiped everybody out.
He runs things now,

14:20.276 --> 14:23.237
so everybody buys
only from Declan, all right?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.822
He's also got a lock on the port,

14:24.905 --> 14:27.575
so don't even think about using that.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.577
You know,
I'm gonna be honest with you guys.

14:29.660 --> 14:33.080
You wanna take a piss in Montreal,
you gotta go through him first.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.957
[both chuckling softly]

14:35.040 --> 14:37.793
Well, perhaps
he'll be amenable to a partnership.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.957
No, he doesn't do that.
He doesn't make partnerships.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.214
He's not... He's not interested
in keeping the peace.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.716
[Enzo] It's not worth it.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.844
We already went to war
for years with him and Vito.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.263
You know, we almost lost everything.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.640
Let him have it.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.705
Thank you for your honesty.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.584
But our father tasked us with a job,

15:18.667 --> 15:20.794
and we do not ever let him down.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.797
We trust that you will feel the same way.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.761
Great things
are coming to our family, gentlemen,

15:28.844 --> 15:31.555
and my brother and I are very excited.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.309
[tense music playing]

15:40.564 --> 15:42.358
[door buzzing]

15:50.074 --> 15:52.201
[door buzzing]

15:52.993 --> 15:55.412
[exhales sharply, chuckles]

15:58.082 --> 15:59.166
Hey, hey.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.459
[Reggie] Hey.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.628
[Declan] How you doing?

16:03.504 --> 16:04.504
Hey.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.178
[coughs] Thanks for picking me up.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.261
You bet.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.683
[clears throat] I got the address
for the rooming house I'm staying at.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.310
Oh, you're not staying there.
I took care of that.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.145
You are staying with me.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.982
Really? [chuckles]

16:23.065 --> 16:24.316
Of course.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.860
You're my nephew. You're staying with me.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.655
Reggie,
I've got a great spot in the country.

16:29.738 --> 16:33.242
Lots of food, new clothes.
I'm gonna drop you off,

16:33.325 --> 16:35.411
then I got a meeting I gotta get to, okay?

16:35.494 --> 16:38.872
Yeah, all right.
Hey! I got something for you.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.833
Um, because of everything you did for me,

16:40.916 --> 16:42.876
I wanted to give this to you
when I got out.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.047
This helped me a lot in there.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.174
Wow.

16:50.968 --> 16:53.595
[Declan] Look at me and your mom. Babies.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.890
You hold onto that.

16:57.975 --> 16:58.975
For us.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.146
Let's go.

17:04.897 --> 17:05.983
[car door opens]

17:11.195 --> 17:12.281
Stop looking.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.367
That's done with. Let's go home.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.538
Yeah.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.255
[birds chirping]

17:30.841 --> 17:32.468
[Nats] Here goes a big bite!

17:32.551 --> 17:34.803
[imitating airplane whooshing]

17:35.888 --> 17:36.930
Aaah...

17:37.639 --> 17:39.266
Oooh!

17:39.349 --> 17:41.310
[laughs] Almost, Bubba! Almost!

17:41.393 --> 17:43.437
- So, uh...
- There you go!

17:43.520 --> 17:44.521
So, what are they like?

17:45.522 --> 17:47.274
Like no one I ever met before.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.420
Okay, she shows up to this meeting
wearing clothes from a fashion show.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.044
I mean, her coat, it's gotta be worth
two grand or more, I'll bet.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.824
Wow. So what does all this mean for you?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.577
I don't know.
I mean, things are good right now.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.204
It's quiet and steady.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.054
Expansion just means problems, you know?

18:02.122 --> 18:03.122
Yeah.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.210
- How did Zio Dom feel?
- [Nats inhales sharply]

18:06.293 --> 18:09.421
You know him, he's old school.
He won't break the chain of command.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.350
If that's what the families
back home wants,

18:11.381 --> 18:12.674
then that's what he's gonna do.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.027
- Want some more?
- [phone chimes]

18:14.051 --> 18:16.720
Adamo, you can't just eat cookies all day,
bro!

18:17.096 --> 18:18.889
Trust me, you're a boy after my own heart,

18:18.972 --> 18:22.017
but still, you gotta...
you can't just eat the cookies.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.979
You're gonna end up
looking like your old man. [chuckles]

18:26.480 --> 18:28.982
You know what,
I forgot I made a stupid appointment

18:29.066 --> 18:30.859
- for my nails. It's been weeks.
- Okay.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.779
Um, do you gotta go back to work?

18:33.862 --> 18:35.239
Nah, Papa is there.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.367
I'm just gonna take this guy to the park.
You wanna go to the park, big man?

18:38.700 --> 18:41.203
[Valentina] Hmm, okay. I'll be back soon.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.871
- Okay, take care.
- Love you.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.791
Come on, one bite.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.001
One bite.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.171
You have that last cookie? Can I have it?

18:51.255 --> 18:53.674
[tense music playing]

19:18.532 --> 19:20.284
I am not at your beck and call!

19:20.617 --> 19:22.452
Actually, you are.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.789
I told you about the meeting.
What else do you want?

19:25.873 --> 19:27.666
I wanna know about the newcomers.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.587
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I can keep you here all night,

19:32.004 --> 19:33.839
and you can try and explain that to Nats,

19:33.922 --> 19:37.176
or you can tell me what you know
and be on your merry way.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.846
They're cousins from Calabria.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.472
Names?

19:44.391 --> 19:46.059
Teresa and Christian Langana.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.691
- Why were they at the meeting?
- I don't know.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.527
- You sure?
- That's all he told me.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.364
How was Nats' mood after the meeting?

20:00.490 --> 20:01.783
Uh, fine.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.244
Concerned, distracted?

20:04.453 --> 20:06.747
Same as always! I don't know.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.083
Uh, if you hadn't asked,
I wouldn't have thought to mention.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.168
How's that?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.337
It's probably just a family visit.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.382
They didn't strike me as the types
who come to Hamilton, Ontario

20:17.466 --> 20:18.675
for a vacation.

20:18.759 --> 20:22.429
What do you want?
That's all I know, all right?

20:24.139 --> 20:27.017
They don't exactly take minutes
at these things, so...

20:28.268 --> 20:29.436
Can I go?

20:29.853 --> 20:31.146
Is that all right?

20:32.689 --> 20:34.316
Don't forget to get a manicure.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.653
It's the details that matter, Val.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.529
- [Nellie] It's already paid for.
- [scoffs]

20:44.743 --> 20:46.703
- How'd you get her?
- Lucky break.

20:47.454 --> 20:50.040
I've been tailing the whole family
and caught her at a motel

20:50.123 --> 20:52.793
sleeping with another dad
from her son's preschool.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.836
Filmed it through a window.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.838
And Nats is the only capo
I've ever heard of

20:56.922 --> 20:59.549
who actually talks to his wife
about his business.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.178
Seems like a sweet guy,
but he can't keep his mouth shut!

21:03.262 --> 21:04.721
So why did she cheat on him?

21:04.805 --> 21:07.307
[Nellie] <i>Postpartum, boredom,
living in the suburbs,</i>

21:07.391 --> 21:09.643
<i>longing for her carefree days. Pick one.</i>

21:09.726 --> 21:11.687
All that matters is the net result.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.906
[Declan] <i>My shipment
from the cartel was on its way,</i>

21:22.990 --> 21:25.242
<i>and everything else
I needed was locked down:</i>

21:25.325 --> 21:27.995
<i>My supply, the port, the buyers.</i>

21:28.578 --> 21:30.178
<i>But when you're moving hundreds of keys,</i>

21:30.205 --> 21:32.416
<i>you need to diversify
your points of entry.</i>

21:33.792 --> 21:37.671
<i>Back in the day, I used to run with
this cigarette smuggler, Bobby Sunwind.</i>

21:37.754 --> 21:40.090
<i>His reserve straddles
the Canadian/US border,</i>

21:40.173 --> 21:43.677
<i>so we could move anything across
without customs even getting a whiff.</i>

21:43.760 --> 21:46.263
<i>But he was doing time
for a bar fight gone wrong,</i>

21:46.346 --> 21:48.181
<i>so I went to talk to his sister, Rose,</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:50.100
<i>who is now running their operations.</i>

21:50.183 --> 21:51.435
- Hey, Twix.
- [Twix] Hey.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.145
- Rose.
- Hey.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.313
Been awhile.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.441
Been too long. Way, way too long.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.319
You mind if we take a walk?

22:02.529 --> 22:04.197
- Sure.
- I, uh...

22:05.741 --> 22:07.868
saw Bobby a couple of weeks ago.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.203
I mean, under the circumstances,
he's doing all right.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.289
Yeah, he told me.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.292
He said you'd also be by with an offer.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.920
I'm wondering if you're up for moving
something other than cigarettes?

22:19.629 --> 22:21.923
We get asked that a lot. I always say no.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.383
You haven't been asked by me.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.427
That's why I'm listening.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.262
All right.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.891
Six percent on product

22:30.974 --> 22:33.018
or four percent in cash on every load.

22:33.143 --> 22:36.503
We're gonna be dealing with heavy weights,
so those are gonna be big numbers for you.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.775
Well, I'm not interested in dealing,
so that's not a carrot.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.610
I want eight percent cash.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.362
It's a little high for a first-timer.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.822
You wouldn't be coming to me
if I was a first-timer.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.908
I've been running contraband
for over a decade.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.368
I know you have.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.870
But cocaine, smoke, it's different.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.622
Different game, different risks.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.209
Declan, I know that no one
knows the game better than you.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.712
But if I'm gonna ask my people to do this,
it's gotta be worth the risk.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.839
They will walk off a cliff for me,

23:02.923 --> 23:05.425
but that is because they know
that I'm looking out for them.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.428

you looked like Papa

So, what do you think of Domenic?

24:33.221 --> 24:34.431
He's a boss.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.646
Now he has to take orders.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.109
We have to be
a little understanding of that.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.696
But in the end,
he will serve the greater good.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.368
The others aren't an issue.
Soft in the middle.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.873
I know Papa said to lead them by the hand,

I think this is just a waste of time.

No, I think he's right.

Hmm.

They are still our blood, Christian.

with what we need...

We're not chasing you down
for another excuse.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.681
My brother-in-law, okay?
He's a doctor. He's got money.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.141
Shhh. All right, listen to me.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.184
Tomorrow at five, you're gonna be here

35:45.268 --> 35:47.562
with everything paid in full, right?

35:47.645 --> 35:50.314
- Absolutely. Thank you, Domenic!
- Beautiful.

35:50.398 --> 35:51.607
Get out of here.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.276
- [groans]
- Hey!

35:53.359 --> 35:55.111
[grunting]

35:55.194 --> 35:56.445
Luca!

35:56.529 --> 35:58.739
- [Domenic] Stop!
- [Nats] Hey, hey, hey!

35:58.823 --> 36:00.867
- You piece of shit!
- Come here! Hey!

36:00.950 --> 36:01.950
Hey, hey, hey!

36:01.993 --> 36:03.619
Relax!

36:03.703 --> 36:04.745
Relax!

36:06.038 --> 36:09.250
[Domenic] Luca, what are you doing?
You can't go off on a guy like that.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.919
You help him to his car, all right?

36:12.003 --> 36:14.603
Then you're gonna come back here,
you're gonna clean up this mess.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.692
[Luca] It's all over my shirt.
Now I gotta go home...

36:16.716 --> 36:19.302
Eighty dollars worth of sauce!
It's okay, we can still use it.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.636
It's just a couple hairs.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.056
[both laughing]

36:24.140 --> 36:26.142
Hey, Domenic, speaking of hair.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.144
We haven't talked about
the ice queens yet.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.688
- What's to talk about?
- What's to talk about?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.440
We got a boss to answer to.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.484
Ah, they're Vincenzo's kids.
He gave them the keys.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.963
You're just gonna say please
and thank you to those peacocks?

36:37.987 --> 36:39.363
Oh, stop. I don't take orders.

36:39.447 --> 36:42.909
You know, but right now, we gotta go...
we gotta go along with it.

36:42.992 --> 36:45.786
It's... It's...
They kind of scare me, Domenic.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.331
Yeah, it's in their eyes.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.166
They're not like us.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.921
Look, I don't want you
to worry about it, all right?

36:55.004 --> 36:57.298
Right now, we just gotta be smart, right?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.592
'Cause everything we say,
everything we do,

36:59.675 --> 37:01.344
- is reported back. Am I right?
- Yeah.

37:01.427 --> 37:04.013
But you're right.
You know, they're not like us.

37:04.513 --> 37:05.598
[chuckles]

37:06.265 --> 37:07.391
[clears throat]

37:07.475 --> 37:08.517
You're good?

37:11.604 --> 37:14.106
- Yeah, I'm good. Okay.
- All right.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.067
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

37:17.777 --> 37:18.778
[Enzo sighs]

37:18.861 --> 37:20.863
[crickets chirping]

37:22.698 --> 37:24.951
[tense music playing]

37:46.847 --> 37:47.847
[car door shuts]

37:51.727 --> 37:53.104
[Teresa] Middle of nowhere.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.524
It's somewhere for someone.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.402
Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.575
I sense a... reticence,

38:07.243 --> 38:10.246
which, in our business, is understandable,
but...

38:10.788 --> 38:12.748
rest assured, we are on your side.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.542
And how is that?

38:14.625 --> 38:16.961
Well, Vito, he was a problem

38:17.044 --> 38:19.755
for our family for many years.

38:22.466 --> 38:23.676
We have that in common.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.681
We have absolutely nothing in common.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.391
Hmm.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.559
[lighter clicks open]

38:41.610 --> 38:42.611
[Teresa] Mmm.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.865
There's something about being in nature

38:45.948 --> 38:47.992
that makes me want to smoke a cigarette.

38:51.370 --> 38:52.496
I wonder what that is?

38:52.580 --> 38:53.789
What do you want?

38:53.873 --> 38:56.375
- We met with your friends at the port.
- I heard.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.377
They're very loyal, which is good.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.005
Loyalty is a proof of confidence.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.798
That wasn't an answer.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.634
I said, "What do you want?"

39:06.135 --> 39:08.554
The business in Canada has plateaued.

39:08.637 --> 39:11.640
The old men are content

39:11.724 --> 39:14.727
to stay as they are,
which has been good for you,

39:15.311 --> 39:17.772
but bad for the organization.

39:18.105 --> 39:20.775
So the even older men in Italy
sent you two.

39:20.858 --> 39:21.901
[chuckles]

39:23.944 --> 39:25.196
You're funny.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.157
[Teresa] We've done our due diligence.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.784
You are good at what you do.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.828
So we want you
to be our partner in Montreal.

39:32.912 --> 39:33.829
Hmm.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.290
You will be handling volume
you could only dream of.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.958
We will arrange the shipment.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.503
You will do what you do on the ground

39:40.586 --> 39:42.046
to receive and distribute.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.591
We understand the benefit
of having someone

39:45.674 --> 39:47.802
who the locals know and trust.

39:48.511 --> 39:49.428
Hmm...

39:49.512 --> 39:51.639
We don't want to rock the boat.

39:54.266 --> 39:56.143
We want to offer you a yacht.

39:56.519 --> 39:57.770
[chuckles]

40:00.481 --> 40:01.690
You want me...

40:02.149 --> 40:03.526
to work for you?

40:04.318 --> 40:07.530
You say it like we are offering you
a job at McDonald's.

40:08.447 --> 40:11.909
You will be pocketing
no less than 20 million cash

40:12.076 --> 40:13.285
the first year.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.246
Double that the next.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.123
Whatever you need is yours.

40:17.206 --> 40:20.042
You choose your people.
You call the shots.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.128
Running things all alone
comes with problems

40:22.211 --> 40:23.462
you can't even imagine.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.214
- [clicks tongue]
- [Teresa] And for what?

40:25.631 --> 40:29.176
That was only our opening bid.
We came here to negotiate.

40:30.845 --> 40:31.887
Talk to us.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.724
As long as I'm above ground,

40:36.892 --> 40:38.185
I don't work for anyone.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.520
Ever.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.152
[suspenseful music playing]

40:54.702 --> 40:55.828
[cell phone beeps]

41:03.043 --> 41:05.880
[Declan] <i>Vito operated
from 30,000 feet in the air.</i>

41:06.297 --> 41:08.382
<i>He prided himself
in never dealing directly</i>

41:08.466 --> 41:10.551
<i>with the suppliers of the product.</i>

41:11.260 --> 41:14.305
<i>But it was those middle men and partners
who ultimately turned on him.</i>

41:15.055 --> 41:16.932
<i>By dealing directly with the cartel,</i>

41:17.016 --> 41:18.809
<i>I wouldn't suffer the same fate.</i>

41:19.393 --> 41:21.228
<i>With my shipment on the way,</i>

41:21.312 --> 41:23.230
<i>I'd soon be holding all the cards.</i>

41:26.609 --> 41:28.402
They need to see you guys down in payroll.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.571
Some confusion
about your overtime this week.

41:31.071 --> 41:32.615
I'll watch your terminals, though.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.125
[door shuts]

41:49.757 --> 41:50.799
[beeping]

42:03.145 --> 42:04.813
[beeping]

42:29.129 --> 42:31.048
[beeping]

42:31.131 --> 42:32.383
[gate buzzing]

42:51.193 --> 42:52.736
[reversing beep]

43:07.668 --> 43:09.670
[reversing beep]

43:13.215 --> 43:14.675
Declan? All good?

43:14.842 --> 43:15.676
[Declan] <i>Yeah.</i>

43:15.759 --> 43:18.512
I'm about to leave now.
Meet my driver. He's standing by.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.556
Standing by? He just left.

43:21.056 --> 43:22.224
<i>The ship arrived early.</i>

43:22.308 --> 43:24.560
<i>I was actually surprised
how fast your driver got here.</i>

43:24.643 --> 43:27.730
- What are you talking about?
<i>- The load. They just picked it up already.</i>

43:28.606 --> 43:30.149
Well, he didn't pick up shit!

43:30.232 --> 43:31.525
I haven't given him the PIN yet!

43:33.235 --> 43:34.486
He had the PIN number.

43:36.488 --> 43:37.740
Where's my load?

43:38.449 --> 43:40.200
He had the PIN number, uh...

43:40.284 --> 43:41.493
<i>Where is my load?</i>

43:42.911 --> 43:44.663
[cell phone vibrating]

43:49.251 --> 43:50.336
[cell phone beeps]

43:51.879 --> 43:55.174
[Teresa] <i>I told you
there are all kinds of problems</i>

43:55.257 --> 43:57.217
<i>you could never even imagine...</i>

43:58.177 --> 43:59.970
when doing this all by yourself.

44:01.930 --> 44:04.433
Our offer is still on the table <i> </i> for...

44:05.267 --> 44:07.144
<i>another 24 hours.</i>

44:08.187 --> 44:10.773
We will hold onto your shipment
until then,

44:10.856 --> 44:15.152
but the terms will change
for each hour you wait.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.905
Don't think too hard on it, Declan.

44:22.826 --> 44:23.911
[cell phone clatters]

44:28.582 --> 44:29.862
[Declan] <i>Next time on </i> Bad Blood.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.836
My employer sent me
to remind you that our payment deadline

44:32.920 --> 44:34.505
is still the same date.

44:34.588 --> 44:37.800
We are now in possession
of Declan's entire shipment.

44:37.883 --> 44:39.718
What do you think happens to mob wives

44:39.802 --> 44:42.304
who cheat on their husband
and rat on them to the cops?

44:42.388 --> 44:45.057
If I choose to tell Nats, they kill you.

44:45.140 --> 44:48.227
[Domenic]
<i>They just made your 100 keys disappear.</i>

44:48.310 --> 44:51.689
So if we go to war, Declan,
this ain't Vito you're dealing with.

44:52.898 --> 44:55.567
These people, they don't...
they don't got soft spots.

44:56.694 --> 44:57.861
They don't lose.

44:58.404 --> 44:59.405
Neither do I.
