WEBVTT

00:03.069 --> 00:04.640
Yes, yeah!

00:04.740 --> 00:05.804
Whoo!

00:05.806 --> 00:07.471
Yeah!

00:07.474 --> 00:09.341
Yes! Whoo!

00:09.343 --> 00:11.943
Chug, Francine! Whoo!

00:15.682 --> 00:16.785
Whoo!

00:17.684 --> 00:19.684
Whoa, what's the party for?

00:19.686 --> 00:21.620
Stan's uncle died!

00:21.622 --> 00:24.356
And left us a ton of cash, baby.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.291
A toast to me.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.492
I told you if we stayed in touch

00:27.494 --> 00:28.893
with Uncle Mitch it would pay off.

00:28.895 --> 00:30.362
Is this why you always laughed

00:30.364 --> 00:32.229
at his terrible racist jokes?

00:32.232 --> 00:34.233
Yeah, it's one of the reasons.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.237
I guess we should talk about
what to do with this 5 grand.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.505
How about a trip?

00:40.656 --> 00:41.840
Maybe to New York.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.776
I've always wanted to try a calzone.

00:43.778 --> 00:45.243
Calzone?

00:45.245 --> 00:47.379
It's New York City, baby.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.514
I'm getting a turkey sandwich.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.449
A trip? What a waste of money.

00:51.451 --> 00:52.517
Why don't we just pour the cash

00:52.519 --> 00:53.852
down the drain with Uncle Mitch?

00:53.854 --> 00:55.788
We need to invest this money.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.722
I think we all just want a vacation.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.924
We just went on that
trip to Fort Lauderdale.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.594
Sure, it was fun at the time,
but look at us now.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.862
We have nothing to show for it.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.998
We have all the great family memories.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.332
Memories are useless.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.533
What can I do with memories?

01:08.535 --> 01:09.802
Write a memoir?

01:09.804 --> 01:11.136
You think I'm the new Chelsea Handler?

01:11.138 --> 01:13.405
Well, I'm not.
There's only one Chelsea Handler

01:13.407 --> 01:14.739
and she's a goddess.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.809
Dad, we all worship Chelsea Handler.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.076
Keep her name out of your mouth!

01:18.078 --> 01:19.944
Let's have a family vote.

01:19.946 --> 01:24.416
Who wants to use the money to
buy a vacation to New York?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.984
Who's for investing the money?

01:28.622 --> 01:32.090
Oh, yeah! Uncle Mitch is dead!

02:04.258 --> 02:07.325
I thought we were booking
our New York trip.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.727
Why are we at Costco?

02:08.729 --> 02:11.196
Someone's not listening to my podcast.

02:11.198 --> 02:13.398
Costco has a travel agency.
I devoted a whole...

02:14.468 --> 02:17.135
_

02:17.137 --> 02:21.073
We <i> need</i> those leather jackets
if we are going to New York.

02:21.075 --> 02:24.076
Stan, we can't go to New
York without leather jackets.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.078
Lena Dunham will kick our asses.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.346
We may have our differences,
but I'm not an idiot.

02:28.348 --> 02:31.683
I know we need leather
jackets to go to New York.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.618
Okay, you guys grab the jackets.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.887
I'm gonna go and talk to a travel agent

02:34.889 --> 02:36.655
and get us a sweet deal.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.892
I want to book a trip to New York.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.694
All right,
when would you like to fly out?

02:41.696 --> 02:44.829
Fly? Who am I, the CEO of Amazon?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.899
I want to say John or Josh something.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.901
How much will you charge
me if I walk there?

02:48.903 --> 02:50.168
Um, nothing.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.169
That's a good start.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.037
Excuse me, but I've been listening,

02:53.039 --> 02:56.374
and I can tell you are someone
who knows the value of a dollar.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.710
- I do!
- Come with me.

02:57.712 --> 02:59.778
I like this. Not enough strangers

02:59.780 --> 03:01.846
physically escort you places.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.518
Today's your lucky day,

03:06.520 --> 03:07.719
because I'm about to offer you

03:07.721 --> 03:10.823
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.613 --> 03:35.480
I'm offering you the
North American rights

03:35.482 --> 03:38.483
to the off-Broadway show "Stomp,"

03:38.485 --> 03:39.884
all for the low price of...

03:39.886 --> 03:41.553
I will pay whatever you want.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.892
Stan, where did you go?

03:47.894 --> 03:50.162
Costco search and
rescue looked for hours

03:50.164 --> 03:52.564
and then declared you legally dead.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.898
We just read your will.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.768
I'm glad you're alive,
but for the record,

03:55.770 --> 03:58.236
my basketball is not yours to give away.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.838
Well, you're gonna forget all about that

03:59.840 --> 04:00.973
when you hear my news.

04:02.176 --> 04:03.508
Ow!

04:03.510 --> 04:04.576
What is he doing?

04:04.578 --> 04:05.844
Mama, make him stop!

04:05.846 --> 04:08.272
Stan, you're upsetting the children.

04:08.307 --> 04:11.716
Fine. Does anyone in this
family like Broadway?

04:11.718 --> 04:13.852
Really, Dad? We're going to Broadway?!

04:13.854 --> 04:16.654
Nope, Broadway is coming to us.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.123
What'd you say, Big Daddy?

04:18.125 --> 04:21.459
I used the vacation money
to buy "Stomp."

04:21.462 --> 04:24.128
Wait, is "Stomp" the one
where they're all painted blue?

04:24.130 --> 04:25.530
No, that's "Jersey Boys."

04:25.532 --> 04:27.800
"Stomp" was a huge
Broadway hit in the '90s

04:27.802 --> 04:29.334
that put New York on the map.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.403
It incorporates rhythms, acrobatics,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.938
pantomime, and brooms! Here, watch this.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.277
The [BLEEP] was that?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.613
The family voted for a vacation.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.882
This is so much better than a vacation.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.283
We're gonna make buttloads of money

04:45.285 --> 04:47.219
and then you can buy all
the memories you want.

04:47.221 --> 04:50.923
You, sir,
have broken a buttload of hearts.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.492
Stan, I love this.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.960
I've always wanted to be
part of a Broadway show.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.562
Ooh, can I be your assistant?

04:57.564 --> 04:59.164
Really? Yeah, sure.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.234
My first order of business will
be to fetch you some sorbet

05:02.236 --> 05:03.568
in the shape of a penis.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.769
What? Why?

05:04.771 --> 05:06.238
I'm trying to show initiative.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.772
I thought you'd be happy.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.842
Oh, please don't tell me
you're one of those bosses

05:09.844 --> 05:11.520
who can never be happy.

05:13.107 --> 05:14.773
_

05:18.252 --> 05:21.253
Hideki, first thing...
love the picture and résumé.

05:21.255 --> 05:24.722
You don't see a lot of nudes.

05:24.724 --> 05:27.693
I'll just, uh, hang on to this.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.930
Rockin' Ronnie here with Stan Smith,

05:31.932 --> 05:33.665
the man who's given this whole town

05:33.667 --> 05:36.068
a terrible case of "Stomp" fever.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.669
Stan, people are going bonkers

05:37.671 --> 05:39.070
waiting for your show to open.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.538
Let's take some callers.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.474
<i>I love "Stomp,"</i>

05:42.476 --> 05:45.811
<i>and I was sadly out of town
for the audition process,</i>

05:45.813 --> 05:48.614
<i>so I'd like to audition now.</i>

05:48.616 --> 05:50.682
<i>Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!</i>

05:50.684 --> 05:51.817
<i>Clap, clap!</i>

05:51.819 --> 05:53.685
<i>Broom, broom, broom!</i>

05:53.687 --> 05:55.553
<i>Trash can lids!</i>

05:55.555 --> 05:57.155
<i>Brooooom!</i>

05:57.157 --> 05:59.825
Yeah, everyone's very excited.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.093
What do you say we
give some tickets away

06:01.095 --> 06:02.227
at the top of the hour?

06:02.229 --> 06:04.430
Wish we could but the
show's all sold out.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.697
Why are you here promoting the show

06:05.699 --> 06:07.232
if it's totally sold out?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.768
Why don't <i> you</i> ever play
Toad the Wet Sprocket?

06:09.770 --> 06:14.306
Because Toad slept with my wife, Stan.

06:14.308 --> 06:17.643
<i>Awkwaaard!</i>

06:20.247 --> 06:22.380
It's cray-cray-donkulous.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.116
Ever since you bought "Stomp,"

06:24.118 --> 06:27.585
I've been getting the most
amazing treatment around town.

06:27.587 --> 06:28.854
See these earrings?

06:28.856 --> 06:32.057
Everyone at CVS saw me shoplift them,

06:32.059 --> 06:34.059
but nobody said nothing.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.995
My weed dealer let me
play with his tarantula.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.997
Principal Lewis showed
up in my math class

06:38.999 --> 06:41.066
and presented me with
an old bowling trophy.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.334
It was pretty cool.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.202
He was sweating pretty bad.

06:44.204 --> 06:48.207
For Mr. "Stomp" and his family,
compliments of the chef.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.009
Wow, Dad, I'm sorry.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.145
Buying "Stomp" was a great idea.

06:53.147 --> 06:55.280
Guys, you don't have to apologize.

06:55.282 --> 06:59.485
A simple singing of the
"Wrong Song" is all I need.

06:59.487 --> 07:02.154
♪ You were right, so, so right ♪

07:02.156 --> 07:04.356
♪ And we were oh, so wrong ♪

07:04.358 --> 07:06.825
♪ You are smart and we are dumb ♪

07:06.827 --> 07:09.561
♪ That's why we sing this song ♪

07:09.563 --> 07:14.833
♪ We're idiooots ♪

07:14.835 --> 07:17.235
_

07:19.039 --> 07:21.773
Man, if that house was any more packed,

07:21.775 --> 07:22.974
it'd be my wife's suitcase

07:22.976 --> 07:25.043
when we're just going
away for the weekend.

07:28.216 --> 07:29.951
_

07:31.118 --> 07:32.317
We want "Stomp"!

07:32.319 --> 07:33.318
Opening night.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.586
Feel the electricity.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.653
How's my cast?

07:35.655 --> 07:36.788
To tell you the truth,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.256
we're a little nervous, Stan.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.591
We haven't rehearsed at all.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.593
In fact, we never even met the director.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.995
Director?
What do you think this is, a movie?

07:43.997 --> 07:45.663
You didn't hire a director?

07:45.665 --> 07:48.200
All the direction you need is
right there in the title...

07:48.202 --> 07:50.468
Stomp. Just go out there and do it.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.938
Feet, broom, floor. Now, come on,

07:52.940 --> 07:54.206
this audience paid 100 bucks a ticket.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.607
Let's give them their money's worth.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.888
What the frick is this?!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.026
We got to get the hell out of here.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.229
Well, bad news...

08:17.231 --> 08:19.297
the angry mob destroyed my SUV.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.234
But good news, they spared Jeff's van.

08:22.236 --> 08:23.902
That "coexist" bumper sticker

08:23.904 --> 08:26.304
has gotten me out of a lot of jams.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.374
Religion is the great unifier.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.576
Oh, look at that,

08:30.578 --> 08:32.311
our house is on fire.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.317
Three weeks on the road and we're broke.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.186
This Luna Bar is our last meal until...

08:41.188 --> 08:43.453
we start eating the leather jackets.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.990
- Never!
- Never!

08:44.992 --> 08:46.125
Look, I'm sorry, guys,

08:46.127 --> 08:48.193
but this is what you wanted, right?

08:48.195 --> 08:49.528
We're making memories.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.663
Remember when that
coyote attacked Steve?

08:51.665 --> 08:53.799
Or how about when the
coyote attacked Hayley?

08:53.801 --> 08:56.401
- And who can forget...
- Yes, we all remember

08:56.403 --> 08:58.804
that coyote you tried to domesticate.

09:02.133 --> 09:03.142
Nice leather jackets.

09:03.144 --> 09:04.209
Big fan.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.545
License and registration.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.680
Sir, this isn't your registration.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.817
It's...
the North American rights to "Stomp"?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.152
You should do a show here.

09:13.154 --> 09:15.154
Sorry,
but our theater days are behind us.

09:15.156 --> 09:16.287
He's kidding.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.556
We're still doing "Stomp,"

09:17.558 --> 09:19.825
and we're bringing it to your town.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.026
Spread the word.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.027
You got it!

09:22.029 --> 09:25.497
Hey, I'll miss you guys.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.765
Francine, what are you doing?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.033
We don't have any performers.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.434
We'll be the performers,

09:29.436 --> 09:32.304
and this time, we'll do it right.

09:34.397 --> 09:35.574
You ripped us off!

09:37.474 --> 09:38.510
What the hell?

09:38.512 --> 09:40.712
I thought we were gonna do
"Stomp" for real this time.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.582
We were going to,
but it just seemed like

09:43.584 --> 09:44.583
a whole lot of work.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.718
So while you were out selling tickets,

09:46.720 --> 09:49.120
we were drinking 40s and
getting super into tetherball.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.922
I started out the worst, Stan,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.391
but now I'm second best.

09:52.393 --> 09:55.594
We realized we could just
say we were putting on a show

09:55.596 --> 09:57.596
and then drive away with
all the ticket money.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.799
So now we go from town
to town doing this.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.267
Ripping people off?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.535
Won't that make us bad people?

10:03.537 --> 10:06.205
No, we're tricking them,
and in my experience,

10:06.207 --> 10:07.672
people love being tricked.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.808
Hey, Jeff, what's that over there?

10:13.146 --> 10:15.014
- See?
- Well, I'm sold.

10:15.016 --> 10:17.549
And I'm a famously tough sell.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.025
And the dancers are always going...

10:28.695 --> 10:30.295
What else do they do?

10:30.836 --> 10:35.500
Oh, you're gonna have
to buy a ticket to find out.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.701
Surprise!

10:36.703 --> 10:37.836
It's me, Hayley!

10:37.838 --> 10:39.438
Who the hell is Hayley?

10:39.440 --> 10:41.440
The gal with the "Stomp" tickets.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.780
Ah, that's a gimme.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.182
Why don't you celebrate
your hole in one with a little...

10:54.084 --> 10:57.212
Wait, I know what this
stranger's talking about.

10:57.247 --> 10:58.609
It's "Stomp"!

10:59.460 --> 11:01.793
Young man,
those are expensive golf clubs.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.863
You can't bang 'em around
like some "Problem Child 2."

11:05.630 --> 11:08.066
Or can you?

11:11.272 --> 11:12.737
Here's 50 bucks.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.674
And you just bought yourself
a ticket to "Stomp."

11:15.676 --> 11:17.075
But I was only paying for the blow...

11:17.077 --> 11:18.477
That was free!

11:21.615 --> 11:23.949
Hot damn,
it feels good to rip people off!

11:23.951 --> 11:27.286
Oh, man, look at those
small-town morons chasing us.

11:27.288 --> 11:28.487
Stan, slow down a little.

11:28.489 --> 11:30.289
Steve, why don't you
serve our friends up

11:30.291 --> 11:32.458
a little pressed ham.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.030
Oh, yeah, they're hungry for it, Steve.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.437
Roger, I told you to go
to the gas station today.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.906
I did, but there were
some college kids there

11:47.908 --> 11:49.240
and I wanted to impress them

11:49.242 --> 11:50.441
and I couldn't think of anything cool,

11:50.443 --> 11:51.843
so I deepthroated the nozzle

11:51.845 --> 11:53.578
and guzzled $80 of gas.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.382
- You idiot!
- Relax. Just punch it when I say.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.721
Guys, th-this ham's getting overcooked.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.656
You can pull up your pants at any time.

12:04.658 --> 12:05.750
Go, go!

12:06.127 --> 12:07.726
Ahh.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.930
Look at me.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.533
I got my son's ass against my window,

12:14.535 --> 12:16.535
my alien's dick in my gas tank,

12:16.537 --> 12:18.870
and nothing but the open
road in front of me.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.940
And here comes God
with the cherry on top.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.142
Let's celebrate.

12:43.564 --> 12:46.031
Did someone order a ham slider?

12:47.168 --> 12:48.167
Yeah, yeah!

12:48.169 --> 12:50.803
Being mean is fun!

12:54.842 --> 12:58.043
Another day,
another town full of suckers.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.244
Patron of the arts.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.246
More like morons of the farts.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.182
What a way with words.

13:03.184 --> 13:05.450
Give me some of that silver tongue.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.786
Yeah! French him, Mom.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.656
Look who's skipping out again.

13:11.658 --> 13:12.791
Sorry, we don't remember you.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.326
We've swindled <i>a lot</i> of people.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.196
Funny. Let's see how funny you are

13:17.198 --> 13:18.697
with my gun in your mouth.

13:27.408 --> 13:29.674
Okay, that was funny.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.210
But that doesn't change the fact

13:31.212 --> 13:33.212
that you guys are in deep trouble.

13:33.214 --> 13:34.946
If you want your money back, sorry,

13:34.948 --> 13:36.815
we spent all of it to have Young MC play

13:36.817 --> 13:38.217
at Klaus' birthday party.

13:38.219 --> 13:39.484
It was freezing out.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.019
For some reason, he wore shorts.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.554
He said he wasn't cold,
but he had goose bumps

13:42.556 --> 13:44.022
all over his legs.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.090
That's all I can remember.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.492
Well, if we can't get our money,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.561
we're getting that show.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.931
And it better be good,
or else you're dead.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.837
Do it!

14:19.126 --> 14:22.193
Are we good at this?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.462
How is it possible?

14:23.464 --> 14:24.930
I guess during the past year

14:24.932 --> 14:26.531
when we were pitching the show,

14:26.533 --> 14:28.199
we must've learned how to stomp.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.353
Stop the play!

14:48.355 --> 14:50.689
I'm from New York City.

14:50.691 --> 14:52.291
He's wearing a scarf!

14:52.293 --> 14:53.558
Let him speak!

14:53.560 --> 14:55.226
I'm a producer...

14:55.228 --> 14:56.495
a very important person

14:56.497 --> 14:58.229
to a very small segment of people.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.766
You simply must come with me
and do this show on Broadway.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.034
Did you hear that, family?

15:03.036 --> 15:04.970
We finally get to go to New York City.

15:04.972 --> 15:09.508
Mm! I can almost taste
that Times Square turkey.

15:09.510 --> 15:12.377
And we got what we wanted...
half a show.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.512
Good luck in New York!

15:15.248 --> 15:16.915
Wait.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.050
There's one thing that stands

15:19.052 --> 15:21.586
between you and New York City.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.655
Do you have a leather jacket?

15:23.657 --> 15:25.524
We have 10.

15:32.533 --> 15:33.932
Stomp!

15:34.132 --> 15:36.468
- Mazel tov!
- Let's go Mets and Yankees!

15:36.470 --> 15:38.603
Our clam chowder is red!

15:39.244 --> 15:41.873
Francine, Hayley, Steve?

15:41.875 --> 15:44.743
Anyone up for a little
tai chi in Central P?

15:44.745 --> 15:46.878
They all left right after the show.

15:46.880 --> 15:47.879
Again?

15:47.881 --> 15:50.015
Do you want to hit up C Park with me?

15:50.017 --> 15:51.282
I can't.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.551
I'm a ghost.

15:52.553 --> 15:55.687
I died in this very theater in 1927.

15:55.689 --> 15:59.224
Only a kiss will free me
from haunting this realm.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.393
Please, sir, a kiss?

16:03.224 --> 16:04.563
You stupid idiot.

16:04.565 --> 16:08.133
I'm not a ghost, I'm a perverted boy.

16:10.771 --> 16:14.706
Morning, Steve. I made a big
family breakfast like old times.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.375
Wait, wait, wait. I got a joke here.

16:16.377 --> 16:17.976
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

16:17.978 --> 16:20.912
Not me. I have brunch plans with Diane.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.313
Diane?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.382
Steve's girlfriend.

16:23.384 --> 16:24.649
It's pretty serious.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.986
She's 50, but she looks 57.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.454
Sorry, we have to run.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.323
Oh, we were supposed to be
at the gallery ages ago.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.792
Gallery?

16:33.794 --> 16:36.327
Jeff is one of New York's
premier underground artists.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.464
See ya. On Tuesdays,
I play melancholy violin music

16:39.466 --> 16:41.400
on a subway platform.

16:41.402 --> 16:43.802
Francine, what has happened to us?

16:43.804 --> 16:46.071
This family used to be so close.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.606
Now the only time we spend together

16:47.608 --> 16:49.340
is on stage when we're performing.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.878
I hear ya, but can we talk
about it during "Stomp" tonight?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.546
I don't want to be late for my first day

16:54.548 --> 16:56.081
writing on "Law & Order."

16:56.083 --> 16:58.083
- What are you doing today?
- Oh, I'm busy, Stan.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.285
I've got a big day of
staring out this window

17:00.287 --> 17:02.421
and reporting our neighbors to the FBI.

17:02.423 --> 17:03.755
You don't have to be right.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.356
You just have to have a phone.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.291
They're all happy.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.029
Maybe I'm not giving this town a chance.

17:23.615 --> 17:26.711
So, Balanchine's "Agon"
is going at the Koch Theater.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.780
Balanchine's "Agon"?

17:28.782 --> 17:32.117
We might as well see Hall
& Oates at the ESPN Zone.

17:32.119 --> 17:36.321
Shall we have dessert at the M&M store?

17:36.323 --> 17:39.190
Is it one of <i> those</i> Sundays again, Diane?

17:40.127 --> 17:41.993
Oop, your fibromyalgia medication

17:41.995 --> 17:43.562
is ready for pick up.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.470
Bird!

17:51.472 --> 17:52.972
It's in my hair!

17:53.074 --> 17:54.673
It's in my hair!

18:01.682 --> 18:03.148
It's a beautiful painting.

18:03.150 --> 18:06.285
Thanks,
but I was trying to write a book.

18:06.287 --> 18:09.621
I'll never be a novelist!

18:17.631 --> 18:20.899
Mr. Wolf, I have an idea for an episode.

18:20.901 --> 18:23.034
What if a waiter gets murdered,

18:23.036 --> 18:26.638
and we find out that the
murderer who murdered him

18:26.640 --> 18:29.240
isn't who we thought he was?

18:29.242 --> 18:32.377
We've already done that.

18:49.130 --> 18:52.064
Tough city,
but I couldn't live anywhere else.

18:53.534 --> 18:57.736
Everyone's miserable and
they don't even know it.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.010
- Stan Smith?
- Yes.

19:05.012 --> 19:07.012
I've been looking everywhere for you.

19:07.014 --> 19:09.614
I'm Eric Jeremyson III,
president of Broadway.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.016
Hi.

19:11.018 --> 19:12.751
Buying the North American rights
to "Stomp"

19:12.753 --> 19:14.285
was a smart investment.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.355
You must be a very happy man.

19:16.357 --> 19:17.823
Well, obviously you are.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.891
You're sitting here
alone on this park bench,

19:19.893 --> 19:21.893
reflecting on your happiness no doubt.

19:21.895 --> 19:24.830
- Get to it.
- I'd like to offer you and your family

19:24.832 --> 19:27.232
a lifetime contract to perform "Stomp."

19:27.234 --> 19:30.101
Imagine, you'll be in New York for life!

19:30.103 --> 19:32.437
But I need your answer tonight.

19:32.439 --> 19:36.308
- Why?
- For drama!

19:40.447 --> 19:42.047
Hey, where are the brooms?

19:42.049 --> 19:44.850
Huh, are they not where they always are?

19:44.852 --> 19:46.718
There's just rakes.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.187
No brooms?!

19:48.189 --> 19:51.056
What the hell are we
supposed to do with rakes?!

19:51.058 --> 19:53.992
Calm down. We're the ones
that make the show amazing.

19:53.994 --> 19:55.594
The props don't matter.

19:58.225 --> 19:59.598
The props definitely matter!

19:59.600 --> 20:01.466
The brooms were the real stars!

20:01.468 --> 20:03.268
I've got to tell you
something before you read it

20:03.270 --> 20:04.936
in <i> The Village Voice</i> tomorrow.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.671
I switched out the brooms.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.607
Why would you do such a thing?

20:08.609 --> 20:09.941
I know we didn't vote on it,

20:09.943 --> 20:11.877
but our family's
happiness is too important

20:11.879 --> 20:13.278
to leave to democracy.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.679
We're miserable here.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.615
Maybe, but being miserable

20:16.617 --> 20:18.149
and pretending to love living here

20:18.151 --> 20:20.285
is just what New Yorkers do.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.420
That's what I was doing.

20:21.422 --> 20:23.688
Being together with you this past year,

20:23.690 --> 20:24.890
I've never felt so alone.

20:24.892 --> 20:26.425
Me, too, babe.

20:26.427 --> 20:28.960
Plus, these buildings are too tall.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.696
And let's admit it,
Domino's has better pizza.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.164
The last time I was happy

20:33.166 --> 20:36.367
was when we were making
memories together as a family.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.903
I want to go back to that place.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.971
I want to go home, too, Dad.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.306
Wrong again, numbnuts.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.426
Bye! Have a great time!
