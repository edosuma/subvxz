00:01.102 --> 00:03.237
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.270 --> 00:05.405
Please remove your clothing now.

00:05.439 --> 00:08.007
ANYA:
 Relationship.
 What kind do we have and...

00:08.041 --> 00:09.509
what is it progressing toward?

00:09.542 --> 00:11.679
They don't even know I exist,
right?

00:11.711 --> 00:14.747
I just like having something
that's just,

00:14.782 --> 00:17.917
you know, mine.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.920
TARA:
 I am, you know.

00:19.952 --> 00:22.489
WILLOW:
 What?

00:22.522 --> 00:25.725
Yours.

00:25.759 --> 00:29.263
*

00:34.201 --> 00:38.037
(grunting)

00:41.575 --> 00:43.009
(shouting)

00:43.042 --> 00:45.112
(grunting)

01:00.661 --> 01:03.396
(grunting)

01:08.168 --> 01:11.138
Okay. You get Fang,
I'll get Horny.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.805
I mean...

01:12.840 --> 01:13.774
(snarling)

01:13.807 --> 01:15.509
(grunting)

01:36.629 --> 01:38.731
(sighs)

01:38.765 --> 01:40.134
Whew.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.770
Vampire-demon tag team.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.438
Who says
we can't all get along?

01:44.472 --> 01:46.674
Don't recall
ever seeing that before.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.277
Oh, 'cause it never happens.
Vamps...

01:49.310 --> 01:52.513
hate demons.
It's like stripes

01:52.545 --> 01:53.813
and polka dots.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.250
Major clashing.

01:56.283 --> 02:01.087
So, uh, I guess we should
tell Giles about this.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.088
Right.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.490
I mean, it's the kind of thing

02:03.524 --> 02:05.759
he'd... want to know about.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.760
Uh-huh.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.627
Like, as soon as possible.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.128
Soon as possible.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.132
I mean it now.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.967
First thing...

02:14.001 --> 02:15.368
in the morning...

02:15.402 --> 02:16.637
we go tell Giles.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.705
First thing. Good plan.
Mmm.

02:21.008 --> 02:24.110
(wolf howling)

02:24.144 --> 02:26.213
*

03:15.094 --> 03:17.465
(crickets chirping)
(dog barking in distance)

03:21.100 --> 03:23.471
*

03:50.631 --> 03:53.066
*

04:20.293 --> 04:22.696
(crickets chirping)

04:26.699 --> 04:29.136
(echoing dripping)

04:38.946 --> 04:41.314
(dripping continues)

04:47.321 --> 04:48.988
(dripping continues)

04:53.994 --> 04:57.230
(dripping continues)

05:12.144 --> 05:15.081
(dripping continues)

05:20.721 --> 05:22.855
(dripping)

05:28.095 --> 05:29.862
(ice cream truck music playing)

05:35.836 --> 05:38.305
Aw, come on.
Big party at Riley's house.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.307
It's gonna be fun.
Why don't you want to go?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.310
You know why not.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.146
Those Initiative men
make me not comfortable.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.981
And you don't care.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.151
They don't even know
that you're an ex-demon.

05:51.183 --> 05:53.821
And we don't know that they'd
care even if they did know.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.822
Which, by the way,
they're not gonna find out.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.358
Anyways, they'll probably
be too busy flirting
with every other girl

05:58.391 --> 06:00.528
at the party to even notice you.
So...

06:00.560 --> 06:03.062
you don't think
I'm desirable enough to be

06:03.096 --> 06:05.699
flirted with? Is that it?

06:05.733 --> 06:07.735
I'm just not gonna win here,
am I?

06:07.767 --> 06:09.737
You don't find me attractive
anymore.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.773
What are you talking about?
I think you're gorgeous.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.776
Oh, really? Well, then why
didn't we have sex last night?

06:15.809 --> 06:18.278
Is that what this is about?

06:18.310 --> 06:21.380
We've gone other nights
without sex.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.115
I know. Twice!

06:23.149 --> 06:25.218
I can't believe
we're breaking up.

06:25.252 --> 06:29.423
Breaking... We're not. Are we?

06:29.456 --> 06:32.759
Of course we are. Y-You've
obviously grown tired of me.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.028
I mean, I've seen it happen
to thousands of women

06:35.062 --> 06:38.130
over the centuries. I just never
thought it would happen to me.

06:38.165 --> 06:42.369
Anya, there's a lot more
to you and me than the sex.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.036
Well, there should be.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.238
A relationship
is something that you work at,

06:46.273 --> 06:49.141
work through, together.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.478
I don't understand.
I'm pretty. I'm young.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.981
I mean, why didn't
you take advantage of me?

06:55.014 --> 06:57.149
Is something wrong
with your body?

06:57.183 --> 06:59.151
There's nothing wrong
with my body.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.488
Well-well,
there must be.

07:01.521 --> 07:04.324
I saw that wrinkled man on TV

07:04.357 --> 07:06.093
talking
about erectile dysfunction...

07:06.125 --> 07:08.327
Whoa! Hey!
(chuckles nervously)

07:08.360 --> 07:09.963
All systems go here.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.600
No function problem, okay?

07:13.966 --> 07:15.502
You want sex?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.170
Let's have sex.
Right here.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.838
Hot, sweaty, big sex!

07:26.480 --> 07:30.082
GILES:
 There's always been
 great discord between them.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.286
And yet you say that the-the
vampire went to the demon's aid.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.288
The-the two of them
were working as a team?

07:35.322 --> 07:38.625
Everything except giving each
other little pats on the behind.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.627
Extraordinarily odd.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.795
As a rule,
demons...

07:42.829 --> 07:46.800
have no empathy for any other
species other than their own.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.802
(man speaking indistinctly)
In fact, uh, you know,
most think of...

07:48.836 --> 07:52.639
(quietly):
vampires as, um, abominations,

07:52.673 --> 07:54.374
mixing with human
blood and all.

07:54.406 --> 07:57.444
So what brought
these two together?
RILEY: Not what,

07:57.476 --> 07:59.178
who.

07:59.211 --> 08:02.115
Adam.
BUFFY:
Think about it.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.317
Who better to bring together
a bunch of demon types

08:04.350 --> 08:07.555
than someone who's made out
of a bunch of demon types.
So he's, um,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.389
bridging the gap
between the races.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.891
Huh. Like
Martin Luther King.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.862
Um... (clears throat)
I-I suggest

08:14.894 --> 08:16.997
that, uh, you know, over
the next several nights,

08:17.029 --> 08:19.199
you two concentrate your
patrol in that same area.

08:19.231 --> 08:22.369
If there's
any other peculiar pairings

08:22.401 --> 08:24.071
or groupings, you let me know.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.238
I'll let the squad know as well.
They're patrolling.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.542
We'll have a, uh, reserve unit
out during the party.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.677
Party?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.178
Tomorrow night.
We're having a thing.

08:32.211 --> 08:34.548
At a time like this?
Wh-Whose idea was that?

08:34.581 --> 08:37.551
Mine. Boys are pretty ragged.
Need to let off steam.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.153
Point taken.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.154
You're welcome
to come.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.892
Well, much as I, uh...

08:44.924 --> 08:47.159
long for a good kegger, I, uh...

08:47.193 --> 08:50.163
I have other plans.
The... Espresso Pump.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.032
TARA:
What are you doing there?

08:52.065 --> 08:55.501
GILES:
I'm, um... It's-it's
a-a meeting of...

08:55.534 --> 08:58.004
of grown-ups. It couldn't
possibly be of any interest

08:58.038 --> 09:00.206
to you lot.
RILEY:
Buffy,

09:00.240 --> 09:03.110
hey, look at the time.
Don't you have a class?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.577
BUFFY:
Yeah, in about 20 minutes.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.547
Yeah, but I have
that thing...

09:07.581 --> 09:11.350
Right. That thing we
could squeeze in before.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.421
Yeah. Got to run.
Bye!

09:14.453 --> 09:17.190
(chuckles)
They-They're
probably goin' to...

09:17.224 --> 09:18.926
Yes, thank you,
Willow. I did

09:18.958 --> 09:20.927
attend university
in the Mesozoic Era.

09:20.961 --> 09:24.297
I do remember what it's like.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.734
(crickets chirping)

09:29.469 --> 09:32.706
Didn't we just get the
furnace fixed? It's freezing.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.107
I'll call in the a.m.,
get somebody to come...

09:35.142 --> 09:38.110
(moaning)

09:38.144 --> 09:39.879
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.615
When do these two
come up for air?

09:41.649 --> 09:44.017
Slaves to the rhythm.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.759
(moaning)

10:02.201 --> 10:05.172
Room should've warmed up
by now.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.774
I've been building this thing
for an hour.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.841
It's still an icebox in here.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.409
Don't bother, Mason. We got
a couple of heat generators

10:10.442 --> 10:11.443
pumping away upstairs.

10:18.686 --> 10:21.321
(moaning)

10:35.402 --> 10:37.804
(crackling)

10:40.307 --> 10:42.676
(moaning)

10:50.216 --> 10:51.150
Geez!

10:51.183 --> 10:52.219
(shouting)

10:55.355 --> 10:57.157
Call a medic!

10:57.190 --> 10:58.826
Get help!

11:07.067 --> 11:09.501
(music playing in distance)

11:14.506 --> 11:16.543
(growls)
(screams)

11:16.576 --> 11:20.379
Oh. It's you.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.883
Spike! What are you doing?
You made me yell really high.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.686
Hey. Yeah, I did. I scared you.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.023
Give me money.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.591
I'm not paying you
for scaring me.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.928
You're not paying me.
I'm robbing you.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.865
Oh, well, now
that's just ludicrous.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.932
You can't hurt me,
because you've got
that chip in your brain.

11:39.966 --> 11:43.036
Also, I like my money
the way it is, when it's mine.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.738
(growls)

11:44.772 --> 11:46.338
Oh, now, come on.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.075
You're not even bumpy anymore.

11:48.107 --> 11:50.744
Oh.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.412
I was just a minute ago.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.914
Hang on. Get me mad again.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.750
(sighs)
Does this really work?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.717
Scaring people
into giving you their money?

11:58.751 --> 12:01.288
Yeah, it works.
Keeps me in blood and beers.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.923
Plus, you know, funny watching
the little humans quail.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.592
I'm beginning to understand
why you're so friendless.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.195
Look who's talking.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.364
I don't see Droopy Boy
on your arm.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.567
Did he have better things to do?

12:16.602 --> 12:18.471
*

12:24.110 --> 12:26.513
(indistinct chatter)

12:30.517 --> 12:32.152
FORREST:
You're kidding.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.153
Mason requested
to go on patrol?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.488
GRAHAM:
He just didn't want
the girls to see him

12:35.522 --> 12:37.289
with his eyebrows
all burnt off.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.725
FORREST:
He's lucky
that's all he lost.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.793
GRAHAM:
You should have
seen it, Ri.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.293
It was weird as hell.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.962
Mm-hmm.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.835
How many kids?

12:47.868 --> 12:50.102
I don't know.
A whole herd of 'em.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.172
And some parents, to boot.
It's kind of embarrassing,

12:52.205 --> 12:53.941
which... welcome
to the life with Anya.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.176
So you don't even know
if she's coming tonight.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.778
I'm thinking no.
She was... pretty upset.

12:59.812 --> 13:03.817
Which makes me wonder,
is it me? Am I the crazy one?

13:03.850 --> 13:06.485
Uh-huh. Absolutely.

13:07.855 --> 13:11.323
Hey, Buffy,
this might be a good time

13:11.357 --> 13:13.592
to mention that someone--
so not me--

13:13.625 --> 13:15.695
spilled something purply
on your new peasant top,

13:15.727 --> 13:17.663
which I would never borrow
without asking.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.798
Still love me?

13:19.832 --> 13:21.168
Uh-huh.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.672
Huh? What about my peasant top?

13:25.705 --> 13:28.841
Nothing.
Xander was just
talking about Anya.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.844
Oh, it's nothing much.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.778
I'm just feeling
pretty glad right now

13:32.812 --> 13:34.947
that a certain ex-demon
doesn't have any powers.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.349
ANYA:
 Boy, I miss those powers.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.788
Yeah. Tell me about it.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.623
A year and a half ago,

13:43.655 --> 13:46.625
I could have eviscerated
him with my thoughts.

13:46.658 --> 13:49.361
Now I can barely
hurt his feelings.

13:49.395 --> 13:52.164
Things used to be
so much simpler.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.832
You know,

13:53.866 --> 13:56.068
you take the killing
for granted.

13:56.102 --> 13:59.172
And then it's gone,
and you're like...

13:59.206 --> 14:03.176
"I wish
I'd appreciated it more."

14:03.210 --> 14:06.745
Stopped and smelled the corpses,
you know?
Yeah.

14:06.778 --> 14:08.748
Now everything's complicated.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.582
It's a terrible thing,
love is.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.851
I been there
myself.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.520
Ended badly.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.923
Of course it did.
It always does.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.359
I've seen 1,000
relationships.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.229
First there's
the love and sex,

14:22.261 --> 14:24.998
then there's nothing left
but the vengeance.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.400
That's how
it works.

14:28.434 --> 14:31.837
You and I should just go do
the vengeance.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.405
Both of us.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.408
You eviscerate Xander,
and I'll stake Dru.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.378
Like a project.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.850
I don't know. I just can't.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.086
(sighs)
But you can

14:47.120 --> 14:48.421
go do Dru though.

14:48.455 --> 14:52.392
Yeah. I will.

14:52.424 --> 14:55.894
Maybe later.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.431
*

14:58.465 --> 15:01.033
See, the thing that they're
afraid to teach us about

15:01.067 --> 15:03.769
is the inherent
sensuality of language.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.873
Y-You learn French, and they
make it all about conjugations

15:06.905 --> 15:10.376
and fronted vowels, but
nobody ever really talks about,

15:10.409 --> 15:14.380
you know, the way
language tastes.

15:14.413 --> 15:18.551
You know? The-the way it feels
rolling over your tongue.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.553
I mean, just
think about "car"

15:21.587 --> 15:24.057
versus "voiture."

15:24.091 --> 15:26.759
(moaning)

15:27.995 --> 15:29.962
Wow!
(chuckles)

15:29.996 --> 15:31.431
A-Are you all right?

15:31.463 --> 15:33.265
Fine. I...

15:33.299 --> 15:37.504
(shudders)
Oh, my God. Wow.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.904
Wow.
(chuckles)

15:38.937 --> 15:42.475
You really like French.
Yeah, well...

15:42.509 --> 15:45.778
(moaning)

15:45.812 --> 15:48.181
(indistinct chatter)

15:51.451 --> 15:55.254
"Lowell House. 1962."

15:55.288 --> 15:56.655
Yes.
(chuckles)

15:56.688 --> 15:58.658
I'm just,

15:58.691 --> 16:01.961
you know, impressing you
with my knowledge

16:01.995 --> 16:04.130
of local history.
Or my knowledge

16:04.163 --> 16:06.166
of reading.
And you didn't

16:06.198 --> 16:08.967
even have to sound anything out.
You should

16:09.001 --> 16:10.937
see me add short columns
of small numbers.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.340
(laughs)

16:13.373 --> 16:15.341
You're funny.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.943
Thanks.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.279
That is...

16:20.312 --> 16:22.115
funny "how amusing" or...

16:22.149 --> 16:24.951
funny "back away
and avoid eye contact"?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.854
Hmm. Kind of both.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.124
Who are you here with?

16:31.158 --> 16:35.062
Right now,
I seem to be here with you.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.368
Hey. Uh, can we...

16:41.400 --> 16:45.804
I, um, need you to take a
look at an... essay for class.

16:45.837 --> 16:48.341
That essay. Right.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.909
Here. I'll catch
you guys in a minute.

16:50.942 --> 16:53.212
Um, there's an essay
I got to look at.

16:53.245 --> 16:57.250
And I'm the one
who got a "D" in Covert Ops.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.421
Hey, Evan, Evan,

17:01.453 --> 17:03.690
come here. You
got to see this.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.758
I'm gettin' a beer.
No, no, no.
First,

17:05.790 --> 17:07.759
just... put your hand...

17:07.794 --> 17:10.195
right here.
Okay.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.598
Somehow this is a trick.
I know it.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.366
Here.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.768
Now stay.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.538
Don't move.

17:18.569 --> 17:20.606
Whoa!

17:22.473 --> 17:23.410
What is that?

17:23.442 --> 17:25.545
(panting)

17:25.577 --> 17:27.180
I kind of feel...

17:27.213 --> 17:30.349
(shuddering):
Oh, my God.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.787
Oh, God!
(panting)

17:34.820 --> 17:37.789
Horses? Like big, tall,

17:37.824 --> 17:40.227
"teeth that can take
your arm off" horses?

17:40.259 --> 17:42.128
Well, sure. I learned
to ride when I was a kid.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.564
It's fun. And by the way,

17:44.596 --> 17:48.134
most horses don't like arm
very much.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.037
I had a bad birthday party pony
thing

17:51.069 --> 17:52.939
when I was four.

17:52.971 --> 17:56.143
I-I look at horses
and I see really big ponies.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.410
You should ride with me
sometime.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.778
I guarantee safety and fun.

17:59.811 --> 18:02.080
Well,

18:02.115 --> 18:03.982
if you promise
you'll look after me.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.287
Don't touch me.
That's just

18:07.319 --> 18:08.954
disgusting.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.589
Tara,

18:10.623 --> 18:13.092
wh-what's the matter?

18:13.125 --> 18:16.262
I don't... I don't know.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.431
I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to...

18:18.464 --> 18:20.633
A-Are you feeling okay?

18:20.666 --> 18:21.667
I'm f-fine.

18:21.701 --> 18:22.669
I just want to...

18:22.701 --> 18:24.371
go to the bathroom.

18:27.839 --> 18:30.210
*

18:32.111 --> 18:34.079
Hey.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.082
I know these guys
from somewhere.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.084
Initiative soldiers.
They live here.

18:38.116 --> 18:40.252
Experiments happen
in the lab under the house.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.154
It's where they kept you
and put in your chip.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.824
Let's have fun!
What are you doing?
You brought me here?

18:44.856 --> 18:46.992
XANDER:
Anya? What are you doing?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.795
You brought him here?

18:48.827 --> 18:50.028
That's what I said.

18:50.061 --> 18:51.798
Only I hit the "here" part.

18:51.830 --> 18:55.468
Anya, this is crazy.
We had a little fight.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.135
That just means
that we have to work our way

18:57.170 --> 18:59.806
through some stuff.
It doesn't mean that we rebound

18:59.838 --> 19:01.840
with the evil undead.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.509
And what have we been doing
with him anyway?

19:03.542 --> 19:04.810
Oh,

19:04.844 --> 19:06.813
who's the puffed-up manly man,

19:06.846 --> 19:08.815
all splotchy

19:08.847 --> 19:10.317
and possessive?
It's not very
convincing,

19:10.349 --> 19:12.117
is it?
Yeah.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.119
I see now what you said
about him earlier.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.488
No follow-through.

19:15.521 --> 19:16.989
Hey!

19:17.022 --> 19:19.326
What a surprise! Hostile 17!

19:19.358 --> 19:21.993
Can I get you a drink,
Hostile 17?!

19:22.028 --> 19:23.796
Xander, stop.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.199
(indistinct chatter)

19:30.169 --> 19:32.872
(scoffs)
Well,

19:32.904 --> 19:34.840
may be some fun to be had
in the lion's den

19:34.874 --> 19:37.410
after all. You
two keep scraping.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.911
I'll find the liquor.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.913
Anya, what are you
doing with him?

19:41.948 --> 19:44.517
We didn't have sex, if
that's what you mean.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.853
That's all I do
now, not have sex.

19:46.885 --> 19:49.521
You're overreacting.
We had a fight.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.525
But, see, it's okay.
It's normal.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.861
Yes. It's the normal part
of ending a relationship

19:54.894 --> 19:57.896
right before
the vengeance begins.
Right.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.199
No. Vengeance?

20:00.232 --> 20:02.201
Relax. I'm not going to do it.
I'm just trying

20:02.234 --> 20:03.869
to tell you
that we have nothing in common

20:03.903 --> 20:06.038
besides both of us liking
your penis.

20:06.071 --> 20:07.773
And now I don't
even have that!

20:07.807 --> 20:10.942
So I get to say when it's done.
And it's done!

20:10.977 --> 20:12.944
Okay, you know what?
You don't deserve

20:12.979 --> 20:14.681
to be the one
to walk away from this.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.715
I've put up
with a hell of a lot from you,

20:16.749 --> 20:18.718
much of that in the last minute.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.420
And if anyone gets
to be the one to leave,

20:20.452 --> 20:23.122
it's me.
You're leaving me?

20:23.154 --> 20:25.258
Yes, I am.
Where are you going?

20:25.291 --> 20:27.559
To enjoy the party.

20:27.594 --> 20:30.396
Well,
then-then I'm staying, too!

20:30.430 --> 20:33.766
To-to show you how much I'm
not bothered by you having fun!

20:33.799 --> 20:36.403
Because I'll be having more fun!

20:36.435 --> 20:37.869
I'm having fun already!

20:37.903 --> 20:41.607
Me, too! Whoo-hoo!

20:43.410 --> 20:46.378
(bottle clinking)
(cheering, whooping)

20:46.413 --> 20:47.747
MAN:
Kiss her.

20:47.779 --> 20:50.182
(chuckling)

20:51.683 --> 20:52.984
Huh.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.453
Sometimes I just don't get

20:54.487 --> 20:56.923
the sophisticated
college lifestyle.

20:58.657 --> 20:59.925
Whoo!
Whoo!

20:59.959 --> 21:01.192
Yeah!

21:03.829 --> 21:05.597
GUY:
Who's got spin?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.500
GUY 2:
I got spin. I'm spinnin'.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.935
GUY:
Yeah! (whoops)

21:09.969 --> 21:11.971
(excited chatter)

21:20.278 --> 21:21.814
Gee, it's a good
thing Mom's out.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.281
We'd be in trouble.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.190
Hey, buddy.

21:31.222 --> 21:33.125
You look familiar.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.260
Yeah. I get that a lot.

21:35.294 --> 21:39.999
* And did you see them...

21:40.031 --> 21:41.401
(laughter)

21:44.202 --> 21:46.105
GAL:
Oh!
GAL 2:
Ah...

21:46.137 --> 21:47.707
Hey, Xander.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.176
Julie!

21:51.210 --> 21:52.545
Okay.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.548
This, then,
would be the kissing.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.653
Very smooth cheek
you have, there.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.522
Do you exfoliate?

22:03.556 --> 22:04.790
GAL:
Yeah!

22:04.824 --> 22:06.826
(all whooping)

22:08.227 --> 22:09.060
Whoa.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.701
Julie! What?

22:16.403 --> 22:17.537
I'm sorry.

22:17.569 --> 22:19.672
I didn't...

22:19.705 --> 22:21.339
I'm sorry.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.509
(running footsteps recede)

22:28.714 --> 22:30.717
(indistinct conversations)

22:34.686 --> 22:36.756
GIRL:
Oh... my... God!

22:36.788 --> 22:38.891
(laughter)

22:38.924 --> 22:41.259
(excited chatter)

22:41.292 --> 22:44.195
(moaning)

22:44.230 --> 22:46.633
Touch it! Oh, oh...

22:49.736 --> 22:51.738
(moaning)

22:52.904 --> 22:54.874
(girl sobbing)

22:54.906 --> 22:56.342
(girl mumbling)

22:56.375 --> 22:58.911
Hi. Um...

22:58.944 --> 23:00.946
You okay?
(sobbing)

23:02.114 --> 23:03.382
Julie?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.952
I'm bad.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.755
(sobbing):
I'm bad.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.623
(door knob rattling)

23:10.656 --> 23:13.192
I'm bad. I'm bad.

23:13.224 --> 23:15.094
(crying):
I'm bad.

23:15.126 --> 23:17.896
I'm bad.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.633
Tara?

23:20.666 --> 23:21.933
It's me.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.238
Tara?

23:30.342 --> 23:31.577
Tara?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.613
*

23:55.366 --> 23:57.236
(faucet squeaks,
water shuts off)

23:57.269 --> 23:59.238
(water splashes)

23:59.270 --> 24:01.272
*

24:05.376 --> 24:08.279
(water splashes)

24:12.719 --> 24:14.452
(splashes)

24:28.634 --> 24:29.801
(screams)

24:32.371 --> 24:34.440
Was that Willow?

24:34.472 --> 24:36.843
I don't know.

24:36.875 --> 24:38.144
Doesn't matter.

24:40.646 --> 24:43.048
(whooping, giggling)

24:46.484 --> 24:48.820
Hey, guys, the girl Julie,
she's freakin' out.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.522
Uh-oh!

24:50.557 --> 24:52.692
Is anyone friends with Julie?

24:52.724 --> 24:54.393
(laughter)

24:54.425 --> 24:55.662
Yeah!

24:55.694 --> 24:58.064
Xander!

24:58.096 --> 24:59.598
Tara?

25:01.701 --> 25:03.035
Xander.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.737
Ghost boy.
Drowning in a tub.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.138
I-I tried to save him, but...

25:07.173 --> 25:10.041
being a ghost already, well...
I-I was way too late.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.144
A ghost?

25:12.178 --> 25:13.813
What's the deal?

25:13.846 --> 25:15.682
Is every frat
on this campus haunted?

25:15.714 --> 25:17.983
And if so, why do people
keep coming to these parties?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.250
'Cause it's not the snacks.

25:21.386 --> 25:22.721
Tara.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.323
How are you?

25:24.355 --> 25:26.826
I'm okay, but I...
I don't like it here.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.059
This house.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.663
I-I think we should go.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.064
(laughter, whooping)

25:33.766 --> 25:35.867
(bottle rattling increases)

25:36.802 --> 25:39.070
(shrieking)

25:39.105 --> 25:40.439
We need Buffy.

25:46.244 --> 25:47.445
Buffy?

25:47.479 --> 25:49.214
Buffy? Riley?

25:55.788 --> 25:57.388
Buffy!

25:59.290 --> 26:02.228
(both moaning)

26:02.260 --> 26:04.096
XANDER:
Buffy!

26:07.133 --> 26:08.734
Buffy!

26:08.768 --> 26:10.769
(heavy breathing)

26:15.273 --> 26:17.276
(Buffy moaning)

26:27.019 --> 26:29.020
(moaning pleasurably)

26:30.690 --> 26:32.924
RILEY:
Do you want to go back?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.559
BUFFY:
Never.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.595
(pounding on door)
Buffy! Riley!

26:36.628 --> 26:38.765
Buffy!

26:38.798 --> 26:40.833
We gotta get them
out of there.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.509
(chandelier crystals tinkling)

26:51.542 --> 26:53.244
(rumbling)

26:53.278 --> 26:55.513
(partygoers chatter fearfully)

26:55.547 --> 26:57.983
(shrieking, shouting)

27:05.356 --> 27:09.228
(loud rumbling,
partygoers screaming)

27:12.832 --> 27:15.667
Well, this party's
starting to liven up after all.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.212
Graham!
Quit standing around!

27:27.246 --> 27:28.547
Help get these people to safety!

27:28.579 --> 27:30.615
Touch not the impure thing...
What?

27:30.648 --> 27:32.050
...or ye shall perish.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.519
Find salvation in the cross

27:33.551 --> 27:34.953
of our Lord and Savior.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.221
Right.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.559
Retinal scan accepted.

27:55.574 --> 27:58.644
(screaming continues)

27:58.676 --> 28:00.679
(rumbling stops)

28:03.883 --> 28:06.117
(screams)

28:14.460 --> 28:17.063
(rumbling)

28:17.096 --> 28:18.364
(glass breaking)

28:20.932 --> 28:23.335
Anya, we gotta get
out of here. Come on.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.237
(shrieking)

28:25.270 --> 28:27.272
(grunting)

28:35.213 --> 28:38.650
Please, God, help me!

28:41.653 --> 28:43.255
(indistinct chatter)

28:43.288 --> 28:45.958
(over intercom):
Re-route through tunnel
five-five.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.859
We've got trouble
upstairs. Now.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.296
Some sort of disembodied
presence in the house.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.897
We've been paging you.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.231
Whatever this thing's
outputting,

28:53.265 --> 28:55.067
it must be scrambling
all the frequencies.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.969
Guard section two.
Level Five precautions.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.105
If the cell door locking
mechanisms malfunction,

28:59.137 --> 29:00.605
you know what to do.

29:00.638 --> 29:01.874
Got it.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.375
You with me?

29:03.409 --> 29:04.911
I'm good.

29:04.943 --> 29:06.178
Let's lock it down.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.252
We have to go back in there.
Why?

29:14.286 --> 29:15.922
Because Buffy
and Riley are trapped.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.455
So?

29:17.489 --> 29:19.625
She's a slayer;
he's a big soldier boy.

29:19.657 --> 29:20.659
What do they need you for?

29:20.692 --> 29:22.594
Anya, look around.

29:22.627 --> 29:25.263
There's ghosts and shaking

29:25.297 --> 29:27.066
and people are going
all Felicity with their hair.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.467
We're fresh out of super people,

29:28.500 --> 29:30.169
and somebody's
gotta go back in there.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.471
Now, who's with me?

29:32.503 --> 29:34.973
SPIKE:
I am.

29:35.007 --> 29:38.109
I know I'm not
the first choice for heroics,

29:38.144 --> 29:40.980
and Buffy's tried to kill me
more than once,

29:41.012 --> 29:43.816
and I don't fancy a single one
of you at all.

29:43.849 --> 29:47.618
But...

29:47.653 --> 29:50.489
Actually, all that
sounds pretty convincing.

29:52.723 --> 29:54.492
I wonder if
Asian House is open?

29:54.526 --> 29:56.694
Xander, let's get
out of here.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.364
You want to bail? Fine.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.298
I'm going back in there,
and I'm not coming out

30:00.332 --> 30:02.667
till I bring
my friend with me.

30:03.801 --> 30:05.804
(door creaking)

30:09.740 --> 30:11.109
(grunts)

30:11.143 --> 30:12.178
(groans)

30:14.212 --> 30:17.383
Or... it...
could be watcher time.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.317
We'll go to Giles.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.719
No, no, wait.
He isn't there.

30:20.751 --> 30:22.221
He was going
to the Espresso Pump.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.190
WILLOW:
But he-he told us not to come.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.992
He-he needed some
grown-up time.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.894
(playing lyrically)

30:28.928 --> 30:32.298
* No one knows what it's like

30:32.330 --> 30:34.732
* To be the bad man

30:36.367 --> 30:38.436
* To be the sad man

30:40.771 --> 30:43.342
* Behind blue eyes

30:45.111 --> 30:48.881
* No one knows what it's like

30:48.914 --> 30:50.582
* To be hated
Oh...

30:50.615 --> 30:51.849
Wow.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.319
Um....
* To be fated

30:54.353 --> 30:56.021
Could we go back
to the haunted house?

30:56.055 --> 30:58.390
Because this is creeping me out.
* To telling only lies

30:58.423 --> 31:00.358
Does he do
this a lot?

31:00.392 --> 31:02.228
Sure.
* But my dreams...

31:02.260 --> 31:03.662
Every day the Earth
rotates backward

31:03.694 --> 31:04.896
and the skies turn orange.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.798
* They aren't as empty

31:08.799 --> 31:11.436
* As my conscience

31:11.470 --> 31:14.105
* Seems to be

31:16.708 --> 31:20.278
* I have hours

31:20.311 --> 31:22.413
* Only lonely

31:22.448 --> 31:24.349
Now I remember
why I used to have

31:24.383 --> 31:26.585
such a crush on him.
* My love is vengeance

31:26.617 --> 31:28.753
Well, he is pretty good.

31:28.787 --> 31:31.690
* That's never free...

31:31.722 --> 31:33.925
His voice is pleasant.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.594
* No one knows what it's like
What?

31:35.626 --> 31:37.296
Oh, come on.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.131
It is kind of sexy.
* To feel these feelings

31:39.164 --> 31:41.299
I'm fighting total
mental breakdown here, Will.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.567
* Like I do

31:42.601 --> 31:44.435
No more fuel
on the fire, please.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.705
* And I blame you...

31:47.739 --> 31:49.740
(spectral voices moaning)

31:53.511 --> 31:55.513
(spectral girl sobbing)

31:57.316 --> 31:58.584
(another girl shrieks)

32:06.157 --> 32:08.160
(heavy breathing)

32:10.596 --> 32:13.898
You're... you're
too far away from me.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.166
I'm right here.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.903
You... have to...

32:18.936 --> 32:21.140
keep touching me.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.575
When you called
to Buffy and Riley,

32:23.608 --> 32:26.778
they didn't cry out
or-or respond in any way?

32:26.811 --> 32:29.080
No. They're
probably dead.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.282
Unless they're too busy
doin' it to answer.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.852
Doing what?

32:33.884 --> 32:35.787
You know, for a god
of acoustic rock,

32:35.820 --> 32:38.289
you're... kind of naive.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.992
I didn't think you meant...

32:41.027 --> 32:42.827
In the midst of all that,

32:42.861 --> 32:44.695
do you really think
they were keeping it up?

32:47.199 --> 32:49.500
Oh, for a different phrasing.
WILLOW: Well, see,
that's the thing.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.770
People all over the party
were starting to act...

32:52.804 --> 32:54.772
weird, sexually.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.974
In what way?

32:57.009 --> 32:58.210
You know.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.845
Ways.

32:59.877 --> 33:02.280
GILES:
Well, it could be
some form of, uh, succubi,

33:02.314 --> 33:04.615
or a-a satyr's prank.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.218
Could even be energy

33:06.251 --> 33:08.886
coming from the lab
beneath Lowell Fraternity.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.955
WILLOW:
It wasn't always
a fraternity.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.324
Look.

33:12.357 --> 33:15.361
"Between 1949 and 1960,

33:15.394 --> 33:17.395
"the Lowell Home for Children

33:17.429 --> 33:19.498
"housed upwards
of 40 adolescents:

33:19.530 --> 33:21.400
"runaways,
juvenile delinquents,

33:21.432 --> 33:23.335
"and emotionally disturbed
teenagers

33:23.368 --> 33:24.635
from the Sunnydale area."

33:24.670 --> 33:25.871
TARA:
Children?

33:25.903 --> 33:27.373
Did any of them...

33:27.405 --> 33:29.407
um... die in there?

33:29.441 --> 33:30.909
GILES:
If there were deaths,

33:30.942 --> 33:33.211
then, uh...
perhaps we're dealing with

33:33.244 --> 33:35.413
a fairly standard haunting.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.083
It doesn't say.

33:37.115 --> 33:38.884
It's mostly about
the old house director,

33:38.916 --> 33:40.219
Genevieve Holt.

33:40.251 --> 33:42.554
"Sunnydale Children's Aid...

33:42.587 --> 33:44.323
"30 years of community service,

33:44.355 --> 33:47.858
giving disadvantaged kids
the love and care they deserve."

33:47.893 --> 33:50.195
When did she die?

33:50.229 --> 33:52.530
She didn't.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.233
No, no.
I don't mind at all.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.667
I was up.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.836
Early morning prayer,
of course.

33:58.869 --> 34:01.038
And I like talking
about my kids.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.040
I still call them that:
my kids.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.743
I-I suppose you were
just like a mother to them.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.179
You did everything
for them?

34:07.212 --> 34:08.414
GENEVIEVE:
Oh, yes.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.181
I fed them and clothed them,

34:10.215 --> 34:12.751
educated them
in the way of the Lord.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.186
I was given a medal.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.621
GILES:
Yes, wonderful.

34:15.652 --> 34:17.588
Um, congratulations.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.391
Um... this'll sound
a little strange,

34:19.425 --> 34:21.793
but, uh... did you notice

34:21.827 --> 34:24.530
any odd disturbances
in-in the house?

34:24.563 --> 34:27.099
I don't understand.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.900
W-Well, um...

34:28.934 --> 34:31.237
like furniture moving
of its own accord

34:31.268 --> 34:34.139
or-or objects appearing
out of nowhere,

34:34.172 --> 34:37.643
or, um, or perhaps y-you saw
someone appear one moment,

34:37.675 --> 34:40.445
and then uh, then they were gone
the next, inexplicably.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.813
Why, that sounds
like crazy talk.

34:42.847 --> 34:46.050
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
Yes.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.655
Um... well, uh,
forgive me for asking this,

34:49.688 --> 34:51.322
but, uh, the children
in your care...

34:51.356 --> 34:52.958
were any of them
ever... ill,

34:52.989 --> 34:55.827
or did anything
ever happen to any of them?

34:55.860 --> 34:58.429
Well, some had the flu and such.

34:58.463 --> 35:00.998
No one died,
if that's what you mean.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.568
The engraving on the medal

35:02.601 --> 35:04.969
says how good I was
with the children.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.737
Oh, yes, yes.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.141
I treated them as I would
my own flesh and blood:

35:09.175 --> 35:12.443
gave them hugs and praise
when they were good

35:12.478 --> 35:14.280
and punished them
when they were dirty.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.081
Well, uh, children
will be children.

35:17.114 --> 35:18.483
They... you know,
they do like to play

35:18.516 --> 35:20.652
in the, uh, the muck.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.289
You didn't mean
muddy dirty.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.925
My kids didn't
think I knew.

35:26.958 --> 35:27.992
But I did.

35:28.025 --> 35:31.530
Very, uh... perceptive of you.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.132
Without me, they would have been

35:34.166 --> 35:36.768
shut out of the kingdom.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.505
Lost to lust.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.840
But you... helped them.

35:42.873 --> 35:46.512
GENEVIEVE :
The girls felt a vanity
more than the boys.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.780
I'd see them preening
like Jezebel,

35:48.813 --> 35:51.382
doting over their pretty hair.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.652
So you'd hack it off.

35:53.684 --> 35:57.389
I'd remove the temptation
to admire themselves.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.791
They were better for it.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.693
What about the bathtub?
Something happened there.

36:01.726 --> 36:05.331
I performed baptisms
on the most unclean...

36:05.364 --> 36:07.164
those who were tainted

36:07.199 --> 36:09.166
with impure
thought and deed.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.869
You held them under.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.271
They needed to be reborn.

36:15.172 --> 36:18.143
You choose to pass
judgment on me?

36:18.175 --> 36:20.246
Well, someone ought to!

36:20.278 --> 36:23.315
You traumatized
and abused these children,

36:23.349 --> 36:25.351
children who have
no doubt become

36:25.384 --> 36:27.853
extremely disturbed adults!

36:27.885 --> 36:29.554
You have ruined lives,
Mrs. Holt.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.324
Furthermore, what you did
has now manifested itself

36:32.358 --> 36:33.925
as a malevolent presence

36:33.958 --> 36:35.594
which threatens
still more lives.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.695
You have a great deal
to answer for.

36:37.728 --> 36:40.532
I refuse to listen to this
when I can smell the sin

36:40.565 --> 36:42.601
on each and every
one of you!
Yeah?

36:42.634 --> 36:43.934
You smell sin?

36:43.969 --> 36:45.371
Well, let me tell you
something, lady.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.672
She who smelt it
dealt it!

36:47.706 --> 36:50.409
It's like what
you said, but faster.

36:50.442 --> 36:53.579
So this totally adds to my
"old people are crazy" theorem.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.547
I don't get it.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.914
I mean, those kids
were tortured,
but they weren't killed.

36:56.947 --> 36:58.284
So where are those
ghosts coming from?

36:58.317 --> 37:00.619
I don't believe
there are any ghosts.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.588
One ran right
through me.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.222
Not a ghost.
An apparition.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.692
I believe we're
dealing with a...

37:06.724 --> 37:08.092
a kind of poltergeist--

37:08.126 --> 37:09.960
a whole cluster
of them, in fact--

37:09.994 --> 37:12.931
born out of intense
adolescent emotion

37:12.963 --> 37:14.565
and sexual energy.

37:14.599 --> 37:17.202
Both of which
were totally pent-up

37:17.235 --> 37:18.570
during Mrs. Holt's
reign of repression.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.137
XANDER:
So, with Buffy
and Riley having...

37:20.170 --> 37:24.742
you know, acts of nakedness
around the clock lately,

37:24.775 --> 37:26.378
maybe they set something free--

37:26.411 --> 37:29.880
like a big,
bursting poltergasm.
Yes.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.550
And now the poltergeists

37:31.583 --> 37:33.818
are drawing more and more energy
out of them...

37:33.851 --> 37:35.454
feeding on them, in fact.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.056
Buffy and Riley are powering
this whole thing.

37:38.088 --> 37:40.559
Okay. They're the battery
in the boo factory.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.960
So what happens when
 the battery's drained?

37:42.994 --> 37:45.331
GILES:
 They die.

37:45.364 --> 37:48.300
(moaning)

37:57.309 --> 37:59.677
(moans pleasurably)

37:59.710 --> 38:02.112
Don't stop.

38:02.146 --> 38:03.715
Never stop
touching me.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.025
ANYA:
What good are weapons

38:15.059 --> 38:16.927
against disembodied
spirits, Xander?

38:16.961 --> 38:18.295
They have no ass
to kick.

38:18.329 --> 38:19.764
She's right.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.632
You should just
stay outside.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.101
We'll bind the spirits
long enough

38:23.134 --> 38:24.702
for you to get
Riley and Buffy out.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.271
How much time
you buying us?

38:26.304 --> 38:27.672
It could be tricky.

38:27.706 --> 38:28.940
We're calling upon
the communal spirit

38:28.974 --> 38:31.009
of a certain time
and place.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.012
Let's go.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.315
(exhales)

38:38.349 --> 38:40.150
What do you feel?

38:40.184 --> 38:42.353
Upset, afraid
of being without you,

38:42.387 --> 38:43.954
and a little hungry.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.023
I meant about the house.

38:46.056 --> 38:47.559
Oh.

38:47.592 --> 38:48.860
Still haunted.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.797
TARA:
Give me your hands.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.498
Form a circle.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.304
Children of the past...

38:59.336 --> 39:03.509
spirits of Lowell...

39:03.541 --> 39:06.844
be guided by our light.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.980
Come forth

39:09.014 --> 39:11.215
and be known to us.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.086
H-how will we know
when it works?

39:17.556 --> 39:19.557
(spectral whispering begins)

39:22.793 --> 39:24.730
We'll know.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.579
House is clean.

39:40.612 --> 39:41.847
Let's go.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.081
You first.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.382
Yeah...

39:57.295 --> 39:58.797
We need to work fast.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.364
Never know how long before
the munchkins get homesick.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.800
Or till the human
battery conks out.

40:02.833 --> 40:04.670
Watch your fingers.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.706
We implore you...

40:08.739 --> 40:11.610
be still.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.043
GILES:
Find it in your hearts

40:13.077 --> 40:15.146
to leave our friends passage.

40:15.179 --> 40:17.414
Transform your pain.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.585
Release your past...

40:19.617 --> 40:22.219
and... uh...

40:22.253 --> 40:23.489
get over it.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.827
You okay?

40:29.994 --> 40:31.262
(grunts)

40:37.536 --> 40:39.304
(wind howling)

40:44.543 --> 40:46.744
Find here the serenity you seek,

40:46.777 --> 40:48.012
the peace you...

40:52.617 --> 40:53.918
What's happened?

40:53.952 --> 40:55.653
We lost them.

40:55.686 --> 40:56.954
Xander.

40:58.188 --> 40:59.824
Xander!

41:02.193 --> 41:03.460
Xander!

41:07.833 --> 41:09.199
(gurgling)

41:18.009 --> 41:20.311
(gurgling)

41:24.849 --> 41:26.851
(spectral voices shrieking)

41:35.360 --> 41:38.228
Shut up,
repressed crybabies!

41:40.699 --> 41:42.833
Aah!

41:51.275 --> 41:52.978
(coughing)

41:53.010 --> 41:54.913
It's okay.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.347
Come on.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.751
(spectral voices moaning)

42:06.257 --> 42:08.025
XANDER:
Come on.
We've just gotta...

42:09.027 --> 42:10.628
Xander!

42:17.534 --> 42:19.204
ANYA:
We can make it through this.

42:27.311 --> 42:28.579
(spectral voice wails)

42:28.614 --> 42:31.115
Xander, get it off!
Anya!

42:37.554 --> 42:38.789
Push.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.262
(panting)

42:44.295 --> 42:45.896
BUFFY:
Xander,

42:45.931 --> 42:47.164
don't you knock?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.371
RILEY:
 I can't believe
 it really happened.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.474
I just had no idea.

42:56.507 --> 42:58.710
It's so creepy.

42:58.744 --> 43:00.811
He was really singing?

43:00.846 --> 43:03.248
I'd say it was
more like crooning.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.115
If we grow old
together,

43:05.150 --> 43:07.117
remind me to skip
the midlife crisis.

43:07.152 --> 43:08.385
Okay.

43:08.418 --> 43:10.255
WILLOW:
Come on. You have to admit,

43:10.288 --> 43:12.056
it was kind of sexy.
XANDER: Please stop
saying that.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.425
I'm willing to offer
cash incentives.

43:14.458 --> 43:16.894
We're just lucky
no one got injured.

43:16.927 --> 43:18.429
No thanks to us.

43:18.463 --> 43:19.429
WILLOW:
Don't be too hard
on yourself.

43:19.463 --> 43:21.266
BUFFY:
He's right, Will.

43:21.298 --> 43:23.001
If Riley and I hadn't...

43:23.034 --> 43:24.434
gotten so wrapped up
in each other,

43:24.469 --> 43:25.670
none of this would
have happened.

43:25.704 --> 43:27.572
True.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.574
Feel shame.
XANDER:
My girlfriend,

43:29.606 --> 43:31.677
mistress of the
learning plateau.

43:31.710 --> 43:33.679
WILLOW:
Really, it wasn't
your fault.

43:33.711 --> 43:36.014
You were under the influence
of powerful magicks.

43:36.047 --> 43:37.682
We were like zombies.

43:37.715 --> 43:38.949
I had no control
over myself at all.

43:38.983 --> 43:41.318
It must have been horrible.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.425
Yeah. Horrible.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.626
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
It was bad.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.599
Grr. Argh.
