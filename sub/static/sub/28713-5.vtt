03:26.628 --> 03:27.462
Shit.

03:41.559 --> 03:42.602
The camera.

03:56.741 --> 03:57.867
Open it.

04:11.548 --> 04:12.632
Where is it?

04:15.260 --> 04:16.511
Have you seen my boot?

05:27.498 --> 05:28.999
Hey, baldy!

05:30.042 --> 05:31.210
Over here!

05:33.087 --> 05:34.422
Over here!

05:36.257 --> 05:38.340
Come on. Come on.

05:38.342 --> 05:41.093
Come on. You can do it.

05:41.095 --> 05:42.471
Here, baldy.

05:44.849 --> 05:46.809
There you go.

05:47.351 --> 05:48.811
There you go.

06:38.569 --> 06:40.237
What the hell are you protecting?

06:52.124 --> 06:53.584
Holy shit.

07:13.104 --> 07:15.231
Morgan, Alicia, do you copy?

07:23.823 --> 07:25.783
<i>Ground 17, respond.</i>

07:26.867 --> 07:27.910
Get out.

07:31.705 --> 07:33.374
Next time, use handcuffs.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.626
<i>Ground 17, go again.</i>

07:39.797 --> 07:41.757
<i>Ground 17, do you copy?</i>

07:43.676 --> 07:44.967
Step away.

07:44.969 --> 07:47.052
<i>Ground 17, respond.</i>

07:47.054 --> 07:49.138
Sounds like you need to answer this.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.182
OK.

07:50.975 --> 07:52.017
OK, OK.

07:54.061 --> 07:55.310
Go for Ground 17.

07:55.312 --> 07:57.563
- <i>Is this the lead?</i>
- Negative. The lead was KIA.

07:57.565 --> 07:59.481
- <i>Report.</i>
- Non-hostiles.

07:59.483 --> 08:02.151
- There was a breach in protocol.
- <i>The payload secure?</i>

08:02.153 --> 08:04.113
- Yes.
- <i>Why aren't you inbound?</i>

08:04.864 --> 08:05.906
Need to refuel.

08:08.409 --> 08:09.452
Do you copy?

08:13.080 --> 08:15.166
I could be inbound in 72 hours.

08:18.878 --> 08:20.588
<i>We're sending a reclamation team.</i>

08:23.799 --> 08:24.842
Roger that.

08:37.145 --> 08:38.856
What's a reclamation team?

08:50.951 --> 08:51.994
Put it on.

08:56.415 --> 08:57.500
Thank you.

09:05.758 --> 09:06.801
Where is it?

09:09.136 --> 09:11.388
You show me where it is, you live.

09:16.477 --> 09:18.310
I have to break one of your legs now.

09:18.312 --> 09:20.981
Doing that will kill me,
more or less.

09:21.524 --> 09:24.360
If you do that,
I'm not telling you shit.

09:25.152 --> 09:27.027
I can be really spiteful like that.

09:27.029 --> 09:31.115
You talk to me and tell me your
story, and I will get you the tape.

09:31.117 --> 09:34.451
Tell me where you're from, what
you are, what you're doing out here,

09:34.453 --> 09:36.703
why it's so important
no one sees that tape.

09:36.705 --> 09:37.540
No.

09:38.082 --> 09:41.625
Then we leave it...
with you killing me for no reason.

09:41.627 --> 09:43.295
I won't answer your questions.

09:43.629 --> 09:46.090
And I won't show you
where the tape is unless you do.

09:47.007 --> 09:48.217
And your helicopter?

09:48.717 --> 09:52.096
My friends are stranded out here.
We'll need a ride out of this place.

09:55.975 --> 09:59.019
You lost someone out here.
You didn't seem upset about that.

09:59.478 --> 10:01.605
You seemed upset
they were sending people.

10:02.273 --> 10:05.276
How much trouble are you gonna be in?
Are they gonna kill you, too?

10:07.528 --> 10:09.194
We could have this done in hours.

10:09.196 --> 10:11.405
- Just answer a few questions.
- I won't.

10:11.407 --> 10:13.615
I don't have a network.
The audience is dead.

10:13.617 --> 10:15.745
I want to know the truth.
That's why I'm here.

10:17.663 --> 10:18.956
Why are you?

10:23.753 --> 10:24.962
The tape first.

10:28.132 --> 10:29.175
No.

10:34.346 --> 10:35.639
We need fuel.

10:59.830 --> 11:01.290
Where are we going to get fuel?

11:02.166 --> 11:03.793
- Fuel drop.
- Fuel drop.

11:09.215 --> 11:10.257
It's high up?

11:13.052 --> 11:14.220
It's for a helicopter.

11:15.638 --> 11:17.181
Well, look at you, crack-wise.

11:20.226 --> 11:21.894
Ascenders? Quickdraws?

11:22.770 --> 11:23.979
How high are we talking?

11:25.773 --> 11:26.857
It's up there.

11:53.725 --> 11:55.018
What was on the map?

11:57.896 --> 12:00.649
What's with the symbol?
Three circles?

12:02.776 --> 12:04.277
Why were you out at the plane?

12:05.737 --> 12:09.449
I know you don't want to
tell me shit, but we have a deal.

12:10.701 --> 12:11.743
So...

12:13.453 --> 12:14.913
start with the basics.

12:15.330 --> 12:16.832
Same thing I ask everyone.

12:17.916 --> 12:22.004
Your name, where you're from,
what you've seen.

12:25.257 --> 12:26.300
OK.

12:28.135 --> 12:29.886
I have to call you something, so...

12:30.887 --> 12:32.681
just gonna call you Happy.

12:34.391 --> 12:36.143
All right, Happy, let's get to it.

12:36.685 --> 12:37.894
Where are you from?

12:46.445 --> 12:48.113
Why does any of this matter?

12:52.576 --> 12:55.954
When we're gone,
our stories will be all that's left.

13:09.801 --> 13:10.886
Wait here.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.396
I said wait here.

13:22.564 --> 13:24.066
I don't take orders from you.

13:29.905 --> 13:31.782
Here. Put this on.

13:33.659 --> 13:36.161
- Not wearing that.
- Can't afford for you to get bit.

13:36.536 --> 13:39.581
I thought we covered this.
I don't take orders from you.

13:46.254 --> 13:48.755
You want to get transactional?
Here's something.

13:48.757 --> 13:53.220
Everything I do is to ensure there's
more than stories left after I die.

13:57.557 --> 13:58.767
There you go, Happy.

14:08.527 --> 14:09.734
Really want me alive?

14:09.736 --> 14:12.195
How about giving me
something more than a jacket?

14:12.197 --> 14:13.240
I've got them.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.888
I don't stay in the car.

14:38.140 --> 14:41.476
That rule kept me alive even before
people ate each other's faces.

14:54.865 --> 14:56.072
Got it!

14:56.074 --> 14:58.452
We have to walk from here,
but we're ten klicks out.

14:59.369 --> 15:01.747
If we move double time,
we make it before sundown.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.375
- Al, it's just a camera.
- I need it.

15:23.644 --> 15:25.018
What the hell was that?

15:25.020 --> 15:28.063
If you weren't wearing that jacket,
you'd be as good as dead.

15:28.065 --> 15:29.232
I needed my bag.

15:33.820 --> 15:36.114
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Be careful with that.

15:38.742 --> 15:41.953
Wait, please. That's not
the one you're looking for.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.166
You had it the whole time?

15:48.168 --> 15:49.584
You might want to watch that

15:49.586 --> 15:51.797
before you spray my brains
across the ground.

15:56.927 --> 15:59.012
<i>I don't know how much longer
I can stay here.</i>

16:00.847 --> 16:02.432
<i>But I'm gonna get as much as I can.</i>

16:10.190 --> 16:12.857
<i>The National Guard is coming in
from the East Bridge.</i>

16:12.859 --> 16:14.820
<i>Word is the Army
is mobilizing, too.</i>

16:15.445 --> 16:17.904
<i>They've declared
a national state of emergency,</i>

16:17.906 --> 16:20.492
<i>cordoned off
the entire area for blocks.</i>

16:22.077 --> 16:23.576
<i>I'm gonna have to go dark.</i>

16:23.578 --> 16:25.414
<i>They see me from the street.</i>

16:27.749 --> 16:29.958
<i>The Army is moving in
from one direction,</i>

16:29.960 --> 16:31.712
<i>the National Guard from the other.</i>

16:33.380 --> 16:34.423
<i>Shit.</i>

16:34.840 --> 16:37.592
<i>Shit. They're shooting
at each other.</i>

16:44.016 --> 16:46.018
<i>I'm sorry, Jesse.
I should have stayed.</i>

16:48.812 --> 16:50.022
<i>Before and after.</i>

16:55.402 --> 16:56.611
What is this?

16:57.195 --> 16:59.406
This is not included
in our transaction.

17:00.032 --> 17:01.950
- Not this.
- You could have been killed.

17:02.868 --> 17:06.246
Your friends wouldn't get home.
Why would you do that for that tape?

17:07.789 --> 17:09.708
I could have said goodbye
to my brother.

17:10.459 --> 17:11.835
I got the story instead.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.503
Now he's dead,
and the story is all that's left.

17:19.343 --> 17:20.594
Since we're sharing...

17:23.180 --> 17:24.640
Why did you kill your partner?

17:34.483 --> 17:36.485
If you see someone
wearing this jacket,

17:37.110 --> 17:38.487
you should be afraid.

17:39.696 --> 17:43.406
We are a force who are not
living for ourselves or for now.

17:43.408 --> 17:45.243
You have your stories,

17:45.869 --> 17:48.080
already making every day the past.

17:48.997 --> 17:50.374
We have the future.

18:44.761 --> 18:47.097
Looks like we aren't
the first to make the climb.

18:50.684 --> 18:52.436
We had to fly just to get in here.

18:53.687 --> 18:55.230
None of the roads are passable.

18:55.772 --> 18:56.898
These people...

18:57.899 --> 18:59.234
probably trying to get out.

19:01.069 --> 19:03.989
Keep our eyes open on the way up.
They could still be up there.

19:06.241 --> 19:07.367
How's your foot?

19:08.368 --> 19:09.661
Are you good with heights?

19:13.123 --> 19:15.709
Al, I need you to answer me.

19:21.340 --> 19:22.591
I've answered plenty.

19:26.637 --> 19:27.846
We'll make camp here.

19:28.889 --> 19:30.891
It's dark soon.
We'll climb at the crack.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.316
Wrap your foot and get some sleep.

19:41.401 --> 19:42.611
I'll keep watch.

20:21.775 --> 20:24.069
What I told you today
I've never told anyone.

20:37.457 --> 20:39.167
You and me are the same kind of bird.

20:40.711 --> 20:42.045
Seems like you had a job,

20:42.921 --> 20:44.298
and you kept doing it,

20:44.798 --> 20:48.260
and it mattered more to you
than people's lives.

20:50.137 --> 20:51.179
Me, too.

20:54.850 --> 20:57.602
That's why I killed him.
I was doing my job.

20:59.688 --> 21:01.356
I didn't mean to piss on yours.

21:03.567 --> 21:04.985
I do think stories matter.

21:07.612 --> 21:10.574
Some things matter more
to me, that's all.

21:50.238 --> 21:52.699
If we don't trust each other,
we end up like him.

21:56.452 --> 21:59.205
You fall, I fall.
That's all the trust I need.

21:59.455 --> 22:02.166
Yeah. Just follow my lead, all right?

22:48.922 --> 22:51.382
We have to go by him.
It's the only path.

23:14.155 --> 23:15.239
Al!

23:15.823 --> 23:18.868
I need you to climb over to
this anchor for the final push.

23:48.481 --> 23:50.940
Almost there. You good?

23:50.942 --> 23:52.318
Let's do it.

24:08.126 --> 24:09.460
Are you OK?

24:16.759 --> 24:18.301
Unhook from the line!

24:18.303 --> 24:19.345
No!

24:31.357 --> 24:34.444
Listen, I'm gonna need a little bit
of slack. Can you do that?

24:35.445 --> 24:36.360
Yes!

24:36.362 --> 24:37.405
You fall, I fall.

24:56.507 --> 24:57.550
I'm good!

24:58.676 --> 24:59.719
All right?

26:41.029 --> 26:42.280
You fall, I fall.

26:50.163 --> 26:51.372
He was my friend.

26:55.043 --> 26:56.336
You killed your friend?

27:00.506 --> 27:02.091
We were doing what we always do.

27:05.470 --> 27:07.430
Come get supplies; get in, get out.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.643
Supplies for what?

27:14.687 --> 27:15.730
Purifying water.

27:21.069 --> 27:23.529
There's a nuclear power plant
ten miles from here.

27:26.032 --> 27:28.324
We took every precaution,

27:28.326 --> 27:30.411
timed everything out perfectly.

27:34.165 --> 27:37.708
But on that last run, when Beckett
saw what radiation did to the dead,

27:37.710 --> 27:39.087
he cracked.

27:40.338 --> 27:43.091
He was afraid that he was
going to end up just like them.

27:45.593 --> 27:46.719
And he did.

27:50.390 --> 27:51.516
He kept this with him.

27:53.017 --> 27:56.729
It's a key to this cabin
he always talked about.

27:59.941 --> 28:04.445
It had this view that you could see
all the way to the end of creation.

28:08.408 --> 28:09.993
I see that view every day.

28:30.972 --> 28:32.223
Why didn't you let him go?

28:35.393 --> 28:37.061
Nobody just walks away,

28:37.937 --> 28:39.814
let alone with the maps he carried.

28:41.024 --> 28:42.358
We exchanged fire.

28:43.568 --> 28:44.902
So you didn't just kill him.

28:45.486 --> 28:46.738
You gave him a chance.

28:47.238 --> 28:48.364
I hesitated.

28:50.366 --> 28:53.826
He was afraid, so I measured the
possibility of alleviating his fear.

28:53.828 --> 28:55.244
That's not protocol, is it?

28:55.246 --> 28:58.249
Protocol is to extinguish
threats to operational security.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.629
I hesitated. I made a mistake.

29:03.630 --> 29:06.047
- But I shot him.
- Your friend.

29:06.049 --> 29:08.343
My friend... had to die.

29:11.054 --> 29:13.723
You might as well tell me
everything about everything.

29:16.434 --> 29:19.520
You're gonna have to kill me, too,
aren't you?

29:20.605 --> 29:22.482
No, I'm not. I need your help.

29:24.484 --> 29:25.568
I need that tape.

29:27.070 --> 29:28.112
Right.

29:30.156 --> 29:32.825
Do you have to kill me
for operational security?

29:41.417 --> 29:42.460
Yeah.

29:43.586 --> 29:44.629
I do.

30:04.114 --> 30:05.699
He didn't make it very far.

30:06.325 --> 30:08.577
Left his friend to die
on the side of a cliff.

30:13.874 --> 30:14.917
Stay here.

30:24.260 --> 30:26.637
I told you, I don't follow orders.

30:28.013 --> 30:29.682
I'm gonna hang onto this...

30:30.641 --> 30:32.184
for my operational security.

30:34.728 --> 30:36.146
These two gonna be enough?

30:37.815 --> 30:39.942
It will be enough
to get the chopper up here.

30:40.401 --> 30:42.611
Then we take what's left
and go where we need to.

30:48.033 --> 30:51.078
You're still not gonna fly me
or my friends out of here, are you?

30:51.495 --> 30:53.122
Even if I give you the tape...

30:54.290 --> 30:56.709
I've got the climbing gear,
the fuel and your gun.

31:00.546 --> 31:02.256
Leaving me here would be a bad idea.

31:08.387 --> 31:09.930
You've got food, water.

31:10.848 --> 31:12.182
- You'll manage.
- And you?

31:14.852 --> 31:16.018
We'll go home.

31:16.020 --> 31:19.271
From what I saw, you couldn't keep
a Skyvan in the air. Flown an L3?

31:19.273 --> 31:21.442
- I'll figure it out.
- No, you won't.

31:25.696 --> 31:28.614
The reclamation team will be here
in less than 24 hours,

31:28.616 --> 31:32.244
and if you or your friends are
anywhere near that helicopter...

31:32.828 --> 31:34.622
Just don't be.

31:37.916 --> 31:39.251
Forget the helicopter.

31:40.169 --> 31:41.587
We'll find another way out.

31:42.171 --> 31:43.756
Were you gonna give me that tape?

31:45.841 --> 31:47.343
You have to destroy it!

31:55.184 --> 31:56.018
Why?

31:56.685 --> 31:58.103
You want that interview?

31:59.605 --> 32:00.648
Let's talk.

32:04.902 --> 32:07.569
The place I'm from,
I'm not gonna tell you where it is,

32:07.571 --> 32:09.571
I'm not gonna tell you
what it's called,

32:09.573 --> 32:11.531
but there is something
I will tell you.

32:11.533 --> 32:12.743
What?

32:14.870 --> 32:16.995
It's bigger than me.
It's bigger than you.

32:16.997 --> 32:19.706
- It's bigger than all of us.
- Because it's the future.

32:19.708 --> 32:21.249
And we're the past.

32:21.251 --> 32:23.587
And right now,
it's the only thing that matters.

32:26.173 --> 32:28.175
Look, whatever it is...

32:29.301 --> 32:30.344
I want to see it.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.722
Al...

32:35.766 --> 32:37.101
you don't want to go there.

32:40.354 --> 32:41.853
If someone finds the tape,

32:41.855 --> 32:45.276
if they figure out how to read
the map, it makes what we have,

32:45.818 --> 32:47.987
what we're working towards,
vulnerable.

32:51.448 --> 32:52.866
I need you to give me the tape.

32:54.451 --> 32:57.246
This isn't about me or Beckett.

32:58.247 --> 33:02.209
This is about the future
and rebuilding what we all once had.

33:03.335 --> 33:05.296
I will die here if I have to.

33:07.339 --> 33:09.339
And I understand
why you would leave me,

33:09.341 --> 33:11.425
why you think
the tape is more important.

33:11.427 --> 33:13.385
- It's...
- But if you choose the story,

33:13.387 --> 33:15.721
if you do not destroy the tape,

33:15.723 --> 33:17.600
then Beckett's death...

33:18.475 --> 33:19.602
my death...

33:21.228 --> 33:22.896
it might not amount to anything.

33:23.689 --> 33:26.317
You want your brother's death
to mean something?

33:26.817 --> 33:28.402
You want stories to matter?

33:30.779 --> 33:33.866
You have to make sure there's
people around to hear them one day.

33:44.752 --> 33:46.378
I'll show you where the tape is.

33:57.139 --> 33:59.433
- How long do we have?
- Just the night.

34:21.371 --> 34:22.998
They have beer where you're from?

34:28.462 --> 34:29.588
You left that out.

34:34.717 --> 34:35.552
Here.

34:39.931 --> 34:41.225
We have a brewer.

34:42.893 --> 34:46.355
Well, someone who's trying
to be one, anyway.

35:08.877 --> 35:10.004
Not bad.

35:20.222 --> 35:22.850
I would have much rather met you
before all this.

35:27.146 --> 35:29.271
Or maybe in whatever
it's gonna be after.

35:29.273 --> 35:31.150
- You get it.
- Yeah.

35:33.277 --> 35:34.361
I do.

35:38.490 --> 35:39.658
Sun comes up...

35:41.076 --> 35:43.120
we punch in and shit gets real again.

35:44.455 --> 35:45.539
I get it.

36:02.890 --> 36:04.975
Everything's so ugly nowadays.

36:12.441 --> 36:13.651
This is nice.

36:40.669 --> 36:41.711
Let's go.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.549
We have to hurry.

36:56.768 --> 36:58.478
You could have hidden it anywhere.

36:58.812 --> 37:00.730
I had to be sure
someone would find it...

37:01.898 --> 37:03.191
if you killed me.

37:06.111 --> 37:07.779
So you put it on one of the dead?

37:08.363 --> 37:09.406
Yeah.

37:11.658 --> 37:12.868
Not that one.

37:44.816 --> 37:45.859
Here.

37:49.237 --> 37:51.114
- You want to check it on the cam...
- No.

38:32.489 --> 38:33.573
So, that's it, then.

38:38.286 --> 38:40.288
The tape was only part of the story.

38:42.832 --> 38:43.875
The mission...

38:44.459 --> 38:47.796
No one can know anything.
No one can even see us.

38:51.591 --> 38:52.634
But...

38:53.176 --> 38:54.678
- Turn around.
- You...

38:55.136 --> 38:56.346
Turn around!

39:00.058 --> 39:01.101
Please.

39:16.157 --> 39:17.200
I know.

39:19.744 --> 39:21.204
Then why did you bring me here?

39:22.497 --> 39:25.458
Because for however long
it takes you to pull that trigger...

39:29.588 --> 39:31.965
I'll know I chose something
other than the story.

39:42.893 --> 39:43.935
I get it.

39:45.896 --> 39:47.230
I want you to know that.

39:50.358 --> 39:52.152
And I want you
to do something for me.

39:53.278 --> 39:54.654
I want you to take this.

40:02.621 --> 40:04.289
Make sure this story matters.

40:06.583 --> 40:07.834
Make sure he lives.

40:32.692 --> 40:34.152
I want you to live!

40:39.824 --> 40:41.326
Don't chase this story!

40:43.912 --> 40:45.789
Do not try to find me!

40:49.376 --> 40:52.963
I hope you get back to your friends
and that you can get home somehow.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.563
My name is Isabelle.

41:12.232 --> 41:13.441
I'm from Indiana.

41:16.278 --> 41:17.654
And I got to see...

41:18.446 --> 41:20.115
the prettiest thing I've seen...

41:20.949 --> 41:22.576
since the end of everything.

42:58.380 --> 43:01.047
This is Ground 17.
I've refueled and ready to return.

43:01.049 --> 43:02.676
- <i>With the payload?</i>
- Yes.

43:03.093 --> 43:05.720
<i>Copy, Ground 17.
Is the site buttoned up?</i>

43:07.430 --> 43:09.891
Affirmative.
Everything according to protocol.

43:10.517 --> 43:13.728
<i>Calling off the reclamation team.
You are cleared for return.</i>

44:12.120 --> 44:13.538
Morgan, do you copy?

44:14.998 --> 44:16.958
I repeat, Morgan, do you copy?

44:21.421 --> 44:22.464
<i>Al?</i>

44:23.048 --> 44:24.090
<i>Where are you?</i>

44:37.854 --> 44:38.897
Al.

44:40.023 --> 44:41.316
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:45.320 --> 44:46.363
Come here.

44:48.031 --> 44:50.575
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

44:51.034 --> 44:53.078
We were looking for you everywhere.

44:54.204 --> 44:55.247
What happened?

44:56.456 --> 44:58.748
I went back to the plane
to record that walker

44:58.750 --> 45:00.168
and got overrun by the dead.

45:00.585 --> 45:02.003
Had to run into the woods.

45:02.629 --> 45:04.548
Been trying to stay
ahead of them since.

45:04.840 --> 45:07.634
And what was it, the walker?
You said there was a story.

45:09.302 --> 45:10.426
No.

45:10.428 --> 45:14.307
It was a weird lighting trick
through a scuffed lens on my camera.

45:16.434 --> 45:18.186
See where the helicopter came from?

45:18.645 --> 45:20.979
I heard it.
I tried to get there but...

45:20.981 --> 45:22.023
It's all right.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.860
I'm just glad you're safe.

45:26.111 --> 45:28.361
We're gonna find
another way out of here, Al.

45:28.363 --> 45:31.241
And um... hopefully not just us.

45:33.493 --> 45:35.328
- More new people.
- Yeah.

45:36.204 --> 45:37.831
I'll tell you about it on the way.

45:38.623 --> 45:40.417
Come on, let's get you checked out.

45:49.676 --> 45:51.052
Szewczyk-Przygocki.

45:57.392 --> 45:58.600
What?

45:58.602 --> 45:59.811
It's my last name.

46:01.688 --> 46:05.358
I had two parents with Polish names
who insisted on double-barreling.

46:05.859 --> 46:07.736
- You OK?
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:08.195 --> 46:10.906
Just thought I should
tell you both that.

46:12.365 --> 46:13.408
Right.
