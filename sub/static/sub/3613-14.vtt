WEBVTT

00:07.215 --> 00:09.134
Here you go.

00:14.097 --> 00:18.352
- Max! Hey!
- Don't move, don't breathe, just listen!

00:18.560 --> 00:20.812
We're gonna borrow your kid.
We need him just for a day.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.606
If you're smart, you won't
call the cops.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.067
We'll have him home safe
and sound Monday morning,

00:25.233 --> 00:26.693
ready for school.
Do you understand?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.695
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just our little secret, right?

00:28.904 --> 00:30.363
Yeah.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.742
Dad! Dad!

00:38.371 --> 00:40.790
Can I just say
I am actually enjoying this?

00:40.957 --> 00:42.417
Because you're not
doing anything.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.587
Not true. I have painted my fingers
and my toes.

00:46.171 --> 00:49.382
I just hope that this doesn't fall
under the personal gain category.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.218
How could it?
A good witch is a clean witch.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.764
Yep, I think we should spring clean
like this more often.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.807
You go, girl!

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.448 --> 01:15.116
Good job, Prue.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.952
Oh, look, more toys.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.038
I told you Grams
wouldn't throw them away.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.374
Yeah, but we will. Why don't you
put that stuff in the discard pile.

01:23.958 --> 01:28.796
- Wait, what's in there?
- Stuffed animals without eyeballs.

01:29.213 --> 01:34.927
Dollies that look like they've been
through the mill once or twice.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.015
And lookie here,
Miss Phoebe's diaries.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.935
The place where I kept all my secrets.
Give me those.

01:46.230 --> 01:49.650
- What?
- The place you kept your secrets?

01:50.193 --> 01:52.403
Phoebe, you could never
keep a secret.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.280
Oh, that is so not true.

01:54.488 --> 01:56.616
Okay, maybe Prue's
surprise birthday party.

01:56.824 --> 01:58.492
Guess again.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.119
You knew?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.497
Phoebe, you swore
you wouldn't tell her.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.750
I'm sorry, okay?
It was an accident.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.336
- I say we keep all the toys.
- Subject changer.

02:09.544 --> 02:12.006
For our children, for our future.

02:12.214 --> 02:15.259
- That's a good idea.
- Well, you can get rid of mine.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.846
What?

02:19.013 --> 02:21.724
It's just that, you know, we live
in a world with so much violence,

02:21.891 --> 02:23.517
and then you add the evil demons,

02:23.684 --> 02:26.145
and it's a pretty scary place
to raise kids in.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.148
Besides, I don't really think
I'm cut out to be a mom.

02:29.940 --> 02:32.109
How can you say that?

02:32.443 --> 02:35.779
Why don't we have this conversation
later? Like, say, in five years?

02:35.988 --> 02:37.406
Good.

02:38.282 --> 02:41.160
I think dinner's burning.
Phoebe, lend me a hand.

02:42.494 --> 02:44.997
Don't look at my diary.

02:54.506 --> 02:56.884
You try anything, you're dead,
and so is your old man.

02:57.092 --> 03:00.637
- You got that, kid?
- Come on, ease up on him, Mickey.

03:00.804 --> 03:02.473
Kid's not stupid.
Are you, Max?

03:02.973 --> 03:06.560
You're gonna do just like we tell you,
and everything's gonna be fine, right?

03:06.768 --> 03:09.771
Yeah, you better be right about him,
or me and you got problems.

03:09.938 --> 03:13.817
Look, that kid is a living,
breathing, winning lotto ticket.

03:13.984 --> 03:16.820
All I know is my kid brother said
somehow, like magic,

03:16.987 --> 03:19.406
he turned off the arcade alarm system
from across the street

03:19.573 --> 03:21.533
and got them inside.

03:22.117 --> 03:23.493
I don't believe in magic.

03:23.660 --> 03:27.664
So we test him out.
If we don't like what we see,

03:27.831 --> 03:29.666
we cut our losses.

03:43.138 --> 03:46.850
Piper, Phoebe, get in here.

03:47.726 --> 03:49.352
What is it?

03:50.562 --> 03:52.188
Oh, no, not again.

03:52.355 --> 03:54.149
What's it saying?

03:55.150 --> 03:56.860
Help Max.

05:44.216 --> 05:47.553
So maybe Max is a ghost.
I mean, after all, that is a spirit board.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.888
A ghost who needs our help?
I don't think so.

05:50.055 --> 05:51.932
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.476
What if it's just someone
in trouble crying out?

05:54.685 --> 05:58.272
Well, it would have to be someone
with powers. That's not exactly AT&T.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.315
"Help Max." That's not a lot to go on.

06:00.816 --> 06:04.111
Yeah, there's nothing really you can do
unless he sends another message.

06:04.319 --> 06:06.029
What, are you on hold or something?

06:06.780 --> 06:08.740
It's Harry, the new chef at Quake.

06:08.907 --> 06:12.911
He threw out all my Henckel knives.
Apparently, he prefers Forschners.

06:13.704 --> 06:16.123
- You follow any of that?
- No.

06:16.290 --> 06:19.501
Look, we wouldn't have gotten
the message if it wasn't important.

06:19.710 --> 06:22.379
- Okay, so, what do you wanna do?
- Maybe go see Andy.

06:22.546 --> 06:25.048
See if he knows anything about
a Max needing help.

06:25.215 --> 06:27.259
Can you say "long shot"?

06:27.509 --> 06:30.595
All right, you're obsessed.
I accept that.

06:30.762 --> 06:32.723
<i>I'll thumb through the
Book of Shadows,</i>

06:32.931 --> 06:34.808
see if there's anything
on spirit board SOSs.

06:34.975 --> 06:37.561
- Okay, and maybe Piper can...
- Look, wait,

06:37.769 --> 06:40.981
I'm the manager. If I say
I want Henckels, then I want...

06:41.148 --> 06:42.899
Hello?

06:43.900 --> 06:45.527
The jerk hung up on me.

06:47.529 --> 06:49.573
Okay, how can I help you two?

06:50.574 --> 06:52.742
I think we got it under control.

06:52.951 --> 06:57.455
Okay, then I'm going to Quake
before Harry does any more damage.

07:07.257 --> 07:08.800
Ding-dong.

07:08.967 --> 07:11.344
Leo, you're back.
Come in.

07:11.553 --> 07:13.346
It's so good to see you.
How are you?

07:13.513 --> 07:15.140
Better now.

07:15.306 --> 07:18.768
- How are you, Piper?
- I'm better now too.

07:18.977 --> 07:21.855
- Leo!
- Hey, stranger, good to see you.

07:22.021 --> 07:24.315
- Yeah, what brings you back?
- Phoebe.

07:24.899 --> 07:27.652
You know, the chandelier
in the living room keeps flickering.

07:27.861 --> 07:31.656
- Yeah? Well, I'll get my tools.
- Oh, no, no, take your time.

07:32.156 --> 07:34.200
Attic, remember?
You have some reading to do.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.910
Right.

07:37.578 --> 07:39.664
Is that a spirit board?

07:39.956 --> 07:41.457
This?

07:42.083 --> 07:46.796
Yeah, it is. I'm just taking it to the
auction house to have it appraised.

07:46.963 --> 07:49.006
So I'll call you if I hear anything.

07:49.173 --> 07:51.634
I'll be at the restaurant.

07:52.385 --> 07:54.846
- Do you have to go now?
- Yeah, sort of.

07:55.012 --> 07:56.973
But I'll be back soon.
I promise.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.933
Can you wait?

07:59.100 --> 08:00.935
Sure.

08:06.774 --> 08:09.026
So glad you're back.

08:13.030 --> 08:14.365
Okay, let me get this straight.

08:14.573 --> 08:17.159
You think a guy named Max
might be in some kind of trouble,

08:17.368 --> 08:20.538
but you have no idea why.
You've never met him

08:20.746 --> 08:24.917
and really don't have any idea
who he is. Is that about right?

08:25.626 --> 08:27.795
Okay, fine.

08:28.045 --> 08:30.756
See, I had a dream last night.

08:30.965 --> 08:36.053
And in my dream, my sisters
and I were cleaning the attic

08:36.220 --> 08:40.349
when we found
this old Ouija-type board.

08:40.515 --> 08:46.855
And the pointer started to move
until it spelled out, "Help Max."

08:49.400 --> 08:51.235
That's it.

08:56.782 --> 08:59.243
You know, I hear a lot of stories
in my line of work,

08:59.410 --> 09:03.414
but yours are always
very entertaining.

09:03.664 --> 09:06.500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:07.376 --> 09:09.378
Sorry...

09:09.586 --> 09:12.172
...nothing on anyone named Max.

09:12.339 --> 09:14.716
- Thanks for checking.
- Any time.

09:18.178 --> 09:19.596
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:20.264 --> 09:22.766
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:27.896 --> 09:29.773
Harry.

09:30.357 --> 09:33.860
Hey, you must be Pippy.

09:34.027 --> 09:35.362
Piper. And...

09:35.570 --> 09:37.948
You know, your voice doesn't
do you justice.

09:38.115 --> 09:40.409
You're actually attractive.

09:41.118 --> 09:44.246
You cannot come into this restaurant,
throw away all of our knives

09:44.413 --> 09:47.249
and refuse to make
the house specialty...

09:47.415 --> 09:49.459
That is not a proper chef's uniform.

09:49.668 --> 09:51.294
Will be. I'm a trendsetter.

09:51.461 --> 09:54.714
In fact, I decided to change the menu,
so I threw out all the old ones.

09:54.881 --> 09:57.801
Now, my crab ravioli,
there's a specialty.

09:59.678 --> 10:02.847
- Straight from Eden.
- You threw out all the menus?

10:03.765 --> 10:07.727
Hey, complain to your sister Phoebe.
She's on line one.

10:08.436 --> 10:10.730
You're fired!

10:10.939 --> 10:14.609
Oh, attractive and feisty.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.947
You can't fire me,
because you're just a manager.

10:19.114 --> 10:22.200
Unless you'd rather be
the executive chef.

10:34.754 --> 10:36.089
Take that.

10:42.136 --> 10:44.764
Sounds like a real piece of work.
He has a nice voice, though.

10:44.931 --> 10:48.476
- What's he look like?
- A complete and total jerk.

10:48.643 --> 10:51.354
- Is Leo around?
- Yeah, he's working away.

10:51.562 --> 10:53.856
<i>He wants to know when you're
gonna get back, though.</i>

10:54.023 --> 10:56.317
I think it might be a while.
Maybe I should talk to Leo.

10:56.526 --> 10:58.277
Sure, hold on a sec.

10:58.694 --> 11:01.114
- Oh, my God!
- Phoebe!

11:02.448 --> 11:06.452
- Let me call you back.
- Phoebe, wait, I can explain.

11:07.078 --> 11:09.830
- You are a warlock, aren't you?
- No.

11:10.331 --> 11:13.084
Wait, think about it. If I was
a warlock, and I wanted to hurt you,

11:13.292 --> 11:16.254
don't you think I would've done it
the last time I was here?

11:16.420 --> 11:18.839
Okay, good point.

11:19.006 --> 11:24.178
But still, most normal handymen use
ladders to fix chandeliers.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.847
- Are you a witch?
- No.

11:27.056 --> 11:28.724
Then what are you?

11:33.646 --> 11:36.107
These are the blueprints
to the microchip plant.

11:36.273 --> 11:39.110
The main security panel
is in this room here.

11:39.318 --> 11:41.987
All you gotta do is switch the
system off. Start with zone one,

11:42.154 --> 11:44.114
ending up with zone five, okay?

11:44.281 --> 11:47.034
- You got it?
- I can't.

11:47.493 --> 11:50.371
My mom made me promise never
to use my power for bad things.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.374
<i>Yeah, you ever read the book When
Bad Things Happen to Good People?</i>

11:53.582 --> 11:57.378
Look, I got it, Mickey.
You broke into the arcade, right?

11:57.753 --> 11:59.463
This isn't any different, man.

11:59.630 --> 12:01.340
I mean, we're not even
gonna take anything.

12:01.507 --> 12:04.093
We just wanna see
if you can actually do it.

12:05.594 --> 12:10.140
Look, I'm really sorry about what
happened to your mom, okay?

12:10.307 --> 12:11.683
It's a tough break,

12:11.892 --> 12:15.395
but you wanna make sure something
doesn't happen to your dad, don't you?

13:12.535 --> 13:14.371
Well, I'll be damned.

13:14.579 --> 13:18.291
I don't know how you did that,
but I gotta say, I'm very impressed.

13:20.585 --> 13:22.170
Hey!

13:22.379 --> 13:24.380
No!

13:32.889 --> 13:35.642
I really don't know what to say.
I mean, up until today,

13:35.808 --> 13:38.394
I thought you were a handyman.
Now I find out that you're a...

13:38.603 --> 13:40.855
- Whitelighter.
- A whitelighter.

13:41.022 --> 13:45.443
- What exactly is a whitelighter?
- We're really just messengers, guides.

13:45.818 --> 13:49.656
Think of us as guardian angels
for good witches.

13:50.365 --> 13:52.450
Your tea's cold.

13:55.995 --> 13:58.456
Well, you are handy.

14:00.041 --> 14:03.252
So all this time, you knew
who we really were?

14:04.003 --> 14:07.632
I was sent here to watch over you and
your sisters when you got your powers.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.509
You know, help out wherever I could.

14:09.675 --> 14:12.261
- Sent by who?
- "Whom."

14:12.845 --> 14:15.556
They're a group of elder whitelighters.

14:15.723 --> 14:17.808
They're known as the Founders.

14:17.975 --> 14:21.145
You were never supposed to find out.
I screwed up and got caught.

14:21.354 --> 14:25.191
So, what, you're here again
to help us out with something else?

14:25.399 --> 14:27.693
Actually, I'm here
to help a boy named Max.

14:27.902 --> 14:32.907
- Max? Wait, that's...
- The spirit board. I know.

14:33.532 --> 14:36.369
See, Max is a budding good witch,
new to the powers,

14:36.535 --> 14:38.788
but he's very young
and vulnerable.

14:38.954 --> 14:40.623
And he's in serious trouble.

14:40.831 --> 14:42.833
Someone wants to take advantage
of his gift.

14:43.042 --> 14:45.377
- So why don't you help him?
- I did.

14:45.544 --> 14:49.256
I made sure that Prue received his cry
for help. That's why I was sent here.

14:49.423 --> 14:51.842
That's all I'm supposed to do.
The rest is up to Prue.

14:52.009 --> 14:53.886
Yeah, but Prue doesn't know
anything about him.

14:54.053 --> 14:57.723
- She doesn't know he's a little boy.
- Well, she will.

14:58.349 --> 15:00.142
In the meantime,

15:00.309 --> 15:03.395
you must help me keep my secret,
or I could get in trouble, okay?

15:03.562 --> 15:06.315
Piper and Prue can never know
what I really am.

15:06.482 --> 15:11.320
Me, keep a secret?
Hello, wrong Halliwell.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.574
Wait, you have to tell Piper.

15:15.783 --> 15:17.367
If I know her, she's gonna think...

15:17.534 --> 15:20.496
I know, I know,
and that's where I need your help.

15:21.121 --> 15:25.292
You see, whitelighters and witches
aren't allowed to fall in love.

15:25.459 --> 15:28.670
It's like humans and angels aren't.

15:29.213 --> 15:32.174
But I did. I fell in love with Piper.

15:33.175 --> 15:36.053
And I know how much
she cares about you.

15:37.638 --> 15:40.307
It isn't fair to keep her in the dark.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.393
But I have to keep this secret,
so somehow

15:43.560 --> 15:46.521
I have to tell Piper that
I can never see her again,

15:46.688 --> 15:49.483
and I can't tell her why.

15:50.358 --> 15:52.819
You don't need my help, Leo.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.155
You need a miracle.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.498
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

16:08.627 --> 16:11.171
Why don't you just sit there.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.425
That's perfect. So, what's up?

16:15.634 --> 16:18.428
I've got some interesting information
about a boy named Max.

16:18.637 --> 16:21.097
- A boy?
- Named Max, yes.

16:21.931 --> 16:24.309
- Whoa.
- It's curious, huh?

16:24.809 --> 16:26.728
Very.

16:27.270 --> 16:31.483
Earlier today, a microchip plant was
broken into, but nothing was taken.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.194
Stranger still, the alarms
on the inside were turned off

16:34.360 --> 16:37.947
before the front door
was opened on the outside.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.954
So, what does this have to do
with this boy, Max?

16:45.455 --> 16:49.542
Well, security cameras picked up
a car in the parking lot

16:49.709 --> 16:51.836
with a boy in the back seat...

16:53.171 --> 16:57.425
...matching this photo taken
at an arcade last week,

16:57.800 --> 17:02.680
where a couple of kids snuck in
in much the same way.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.807
Same boy, Max Franklin.

17:06.934 --> 17:10.313
Do you know who was
in the front seat?

17:11.646 --> 17:15.734
Just that they shot and wounded
a security guard at the scene.

17:15.902 --> 17:19.363
This boy's in serious trouble, Prue.
This is not a dream.

17:19.989 --> 17:22.742
I need to know what you
know about this.

17:23.034 --> 17:24.827
Well, I mean, why would
I know anything?

17:24.993 --> 17:27.538
I think that you need
to talk to his family.

17:27.704 --> 17:30.207
I did. His father.

17:30.374 --> 17:33.085
He pretended not to know
anything either.

17:33.336 --> 17:35.671
Told me the boy was out of state
visiting grandparents,

17:35.880 --> 17:37.715
will be back tomorrow.

17:38.466 --> 17:40.301
But something's wrong.

17:40.468 --> 17:43.220
He wanted to tell me something,
but he was scared.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.806
He was afraid to say anything.
What are you writing?

17:47.183 --> 17:48.601
Nothing.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.270
I'm just doodling.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.565
You're not gonna tell me
anything, are you?

18:01.030 --> 18:04.992
One day, I'm gonna figure out
your secret, Prue.

18:05.868 --> 18:07.453
Count on it.

18:19.256 --> 18:21.008
Telephone.

18:23.010 --> 18:26.513
- Hello?
- Hey. Look, Max is a boy, Piper,

18:26.680 --> 18:28.891
- and he's been kidnapped.
- What?

18:29.099 --> 18:31.935
Yeah, I got another message
on the spirit board. I have to help.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.062
I think we should call the police.

18:34.271 --> 18:36.023
Andy's already been here,

18:36.190 --> 18:37.941
and I think I have an idea
of what to do.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.068
Okay, so you've got
everything under control?

18:40.235 --> 18:42.696
No, everything's not under control.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.450
I need crab for my ravioli
because someone threw it away,

18:46.658 --> 18:49.536
and I just got five more orders,
Pepper.

19:00.547 --> 19:02.799
- Mr Franklin?
- Yes?

19:03.008 --> 19:07.387
My name's Prue Halliwell.
I need to talk to you about your son.

19:08.638 --> 19:11.558
Sorry, you have to leave, okay?

19:11.725 --> 19:16.062
Look, I know that he's been kidnapped,
I know that he's in trouble.

19:16.771 --> 19:18.440
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:18.648 --> 19:20.233
I think you do.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.153
What I don't understand is
why you won't talk to the police.

19:23.320 --> 19:27.073
Please, you gotta leave,
all right? Thank you.

19:27.657 --> 19:30.076
Unless you can't talk to the police.

19:30.285 --> 19:31.828
The kidnappers won't let you.

19:32.037 --> 19:34.247
That's why you wouldn't say
anything to Trudeau.

19:34.664 --> 19:39.294
Look, I don't know who you are,
but I'm begging you...

19:39.502 --> 19:42.088
- I can help.
- No, no...

19:42.630 --> 19:45.800
...you can't, all right?
Goodbye.

19:46.009 --> 19:47.343
Mr Franklin.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.976
Dear God.

20:03.276 --> 20:05.069
Thank you.

20:07.530 --> 20:11.033
Hi, I know you guys have
been waiting a long time.

20:13.327 --> 20:14.662
Hey, have you heard from Prue?

20:14.871 --> 20:18.708
Yeah. She's got everything
under control. I'll be right back.

20:20.209 --> 20:22.170
It's actually good we have
a few more minutes.

20:22.336 --> 20:24.213
We could go over your plan.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.883
You know, what you're
gonna tell Piper.

20:27.049 --> 20:28.968
Oh, well...

20:29.135 --> 20:31.929
...I thought I'd tell her that...

20:32.096 --> 20:33.598
...you know, as much as I love her,

20:33.764 --> 20:37.852
and as much as I'd like to stay
in San Francisco, I can't.

20:38.019 --> 20:41.647
And I don't know how long my work
will keep me away.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.150
No, no, what you just said
to her was,

20:44.316 --> 20:46.736
as much as you'd love to stay
and have sex with her,

20:46.902 --> 20:50.573
you've got a wife and kids in
another part of the country. Try again.

20:53.617 --> 20:55.578
Piper...

20:57.121 --> 20:59.081
...you know how much
you mean to me,

20:59.248 --> 21:01.917
and more than anything,
I wish things could work out,

21:02.084 --> 21:06.005
but they can't, and no one
is more sorry than me.

21:06.171 --> 21:07.506
Translation:

21:07.673 --> 21:09.758
"I've found someone
I like even better."

21:10.217 --> 21:13.721
- I'm completely confused.
- Look, Leo it's not that complicated.

21:13.929 --> 21:17.182
Okay, just avoid the following:

21:17.349 --> 21:18.809
"We can still hang out."

21:18.976 --> 21:21.311
"I don't deserve you yet."

21:21.478 --> 21:25.315
"I need more 'me' time
before we can have 'we' time."

21:25.482 --> 21:27.234
And my personal favourite:

21:27.526 --> 21:29.987
"It's not you, it's me."

21:30.154 --> 21:32.406
Whatever you do, don't start off
the conversation with,

21:32.573 --> 21:36.076
"We need to talk."
Other than that, you'll do fine.

21:42.833 --> 21:46.587
Then they hit me, and I passed out.

21:47.921 --> 21:51.049
I've been out-of-my-mind
crazy ever since last night.

21:51.216 --> 21:53.760
Should I go to the police?
Should I do what they say?

21:53.969 --> 21:55.595
They promised to bring him back,

21:55.762 --> 21:58.515
but after what the police say
happened this morning...

22:00.350 --> 22:01.977
I don't even know if he's all right.

22:02.310 --> 22:04.980
No, I know that Max is
okay right now.

22:05.147 --> 22:08.692
If he wasn't, he couldn't have
sent me that last message.

22:09.860 --> 22:14.406
So I take it you're a witch too, huh?

22:15.157 --> 22:16.783
Is that what your son says he is?

22:16.950 --> 22:20.704
What Paulette, my wife,
said he is. It's what she was.

22:20.871 --> 22:24.082
You know, it would have been a hell of
a lot easier to handle her family secret

22:24.249 --> 22:26.334
had it been revealed a lot sooner.

22:26.626 --> 22:29.170
Maybe she was afraid
of how you'd react.

22:31.715 --> 22:35.218
Maybe she was afraid that you
might not accept her or love her.

22:35.427 --> 22:38.888
Speaking from personal experience?

22:39.264 --> 22:40.598
Yes, I am.

22:41.433 --> 22:46.146
Yeah, Paulette, she had to tell me.
She was running out of time.

22:46.479 --> 22:48.481
She passed away three months ago.

22:48.857 --> 22:52.277
Then suddenly, Max,
he starts having these powers.

22:52.485 --> 22:55.071
I don't have a clue what to tell him,
what it all means.

22:55.238 --> 22:59.659
Then he uses it and nearly gets
busted at an arcade, and now this.

22:59.826 --> 23:02.579
- I'm sure that Max...
- Do you have any children?

23:02.745 --> 23:04.080
No, but...

23:04.247 --> 23:07.125
Then you couldn't possibly understand
what I'm feeling.

23:08.126 --> 23:11.462
Still, I'm sorry...

23:12.130 --> 23:15.466
...about what happened to Max
and your wife,

23:15.633 --> 23:18.344
but if you could just find
a way to forgive her...

23:18.511 --> 23:20.430
Forgive her.

23:21.180 --> 23:22.640
She should've told me.

23:22.849 --> 23:27.228
Maybe if she had I would have
been better able to protect Max.

23:28.312 --> 23:32.066
Do you know anybody who owns
an auto shop of any kind?

23:32.859 --> 23:34.193
Why?

23:34.402 --> 23:36.529
I think your son was trying
to send me a clue.

23:36.696 --> 23:38.573
No, I...

23:40.908 --> 23:43.202
Although, I think Max's friend Danny...

23:43.369 --> 23:45.746
His brother works at one
over in Oakland.

23:45.913 --> 23:48.708
Is Danny the friend that broke
into the arcade with Max?

23:50.626 --> 23:52.086
Got an address?

24:05.724 --> 24:07.393
- Max?
- Who's there?

24:07.560 --> 24:10.062
My name is Prue.
I'm here to take you home.

24:10.271 --> 24:13.857
- But how'd you find me?
- I had a chat with your friend Danny.

24:14.024 --> 24:16.110
Look, your dad, he's waiting for you.

24:16.318 --> 24:17.945
- You know my dad?
- Yeah.

24:18.445 --> 24:20.281
Hey, who the hell are you?

24:26.495 --> 24:29.331
- Come on, we need to hurry.
- You have powers?

24:29.498 --> 24:31.250
Yeah, I'll explain them
to you in the car.

24:31.417 --> 24:34.294
I can't leave.
They'll kill my dad if I do.

24:47.015 --> 24:48.600
Nap time's over. Wake up.

24:48.767 --> 24:50.602
I got a little surprise for you.

24:50.769 --> 24:52.604
- Max, are you okay?
- He's fine.

24:52.771 --> 24:55.482
- Look, don't worry.
- I said, he's fine.

24:56.358 --> 25:00.946
Now, before you go trying to pull any of
that magical hocus-pocus crap again,

25:01.113 --> 25:02.864
I wanna show you something.

25:04.324 --> 25:06.952
- What is it?
- All that matters is what happens

25:07.119 --> 25:08.912
when I flip that little switch.

25:09.121 --> 25:13.375
Now, I flip that little switch, and
Max here takes a nap, a long one.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.836
- Mickey, why don't...?
- Shut up.

25:28.932 --> 25:33.186
Plastic explosive. Little trick
I picked up in Corcoran.

25:33.395 --> 25:35.438
Prison system's very educational.

25:35.647 --> 25:38.066
Mickey, he's just a child.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.068
He's already proven
he's not going anywhere.

25:40.235 --> 25:42.862
If you're gonna wire anyone,
wire me.

25:43.905 --> 25:45.740
What is it with you?
What are you, magicians?

25:45.907 --> 25:48.243
Freaks of nature?
Aliens? What?

25:48.660 --> 25:50.537
Witches.

25:59.587 --> 26:02.048
- You okay?
- I'm scared.

26:02.549 --> 26:04.175
I know.

26:05.009 --> 26:09.681
Just do as they say,
and everything will be fine.

26:10.014 --> 26:11.432
They need you, remember?

26:11.975 --> 26:14.644
I'm sorry I got you into this.

26:14.852 --> 26:17.480
I'm sorry I have these stupid powers.

26:17.855 --> 26:19.732
No, Max.

26:20.525 --> 26:23.277
Don't ever be sorry about that.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.239
It's a gift.

26:26.656 --> 26:29.909
It's like being a musician
or an athlete.

26:30.576 --> 26:32.495
It's a pain.

26:32.662 --> 26:34.455
I'm a freak.

26:34.622 --> 26:36.582
My dad hates it too.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.377
He hates me.

26:40.836 --> 26:42.672
No, he doesn't.

26:43.464 --> 26:45.758
He just doesn't understand it, that's all.

26:45.967 --> 26:48.010
It's new to him too.

26:51.430 --> 26:52.932
Don't worry, Max.

26:54.892 --> 26:57.853
I won't let anything happen to you.
I promise.

26:58.896 --> 27:00.689
Okay?

27:02.650 --> 27:04.777
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:08.197 --> 27:11.700
You really think it's necessary,
wiring the kid like that?

27:11.867 --> 27:13.869
You saw what that chick did.

27:14.662 --> 27:18.958
Pretty cool, actually.
It might come in handy tonight.

27:19.166 --> 27:21.835
It's the only reason
she's still breathing.

27:30.177 --> 27:34.848
Sorry, small mutiny in the kitchen.
Where were we?

27:35.516 --> 27:38.143
Piper, there's something
I need to tell you.

27:38.310 --> 27:40.854
- Yeah?
- Look, forgive me,

27:41.063 --> 27:44.024
but I could be summoned at any
moment, so I have to tell you this now.

27:46.109 --> 27:47.653
I can't...

27:49.404 --> 27:51.532
I can't...

27:52.950 --> 27:55.327
I can't believe how much I missed you.

27:56.912 --> 28:00.123
Well, Leo, I missed you too,
but what do you mean, summoned?

28:00.290 --> 28:04.252
- Summoned where?
- Hey, Piper.

28:04.544 --> 28:08.048
No respect, I can live with, okay,
but where the hell's my coriander?

28:08.256 --> 28:10.509
Okay, that's it,
I'm ending this now.

28:10.676 --> 28:13.220
Oh, my gosh. You know.

28:13.428 --> 28:15.305
Of course I know.
The whole restaurant knows.

28:15.472 --> 28:17.432
Didn't you hear him scream
across the room?

28:17.724 --> 28:20.268
- I thought it was a secret.
- Phoebe...

28:20.477 --> 28:22.020
It'll probably be in the newspaper.

28:22.187 --> 28:25.732
No, it can't be. Look, Piper,
he never meant to hurt you.

28:25.899 --> 28:29.402
Phoebe, please. You haven't
even met the maniac yet.

28:29.611 --> 28:31.446
What's gotten into you?

28:34.407 --> 28:36.117
She's talking about the new chef.

28:36.326 --> 28:39.245
Oh, right.

28:39.412 --> 28:41.081
So does that mean
she took your news well?

28:41.665 --> 28:44.417
That means she doesn't know.
I can't tell her, Phoebe.

28:44.626 --> 28:47.128
I can't stand to think about it,
much less talk about it.

28:47.337 --> 28:49.589
Here's something else
you might not wanna think about.

28:49.756 --> 28:52.175
Piper said that Prue had
everything under control.

28:52.342 --> 28:54.844
Well, I can't find her.

28:57.639 --> 29:01.059
Say hello to Mickey Jackson.

29:01.226 --> 29:05.104
Security cameras digitally enhanced
for your viewing pleasure.

29:05.271 --> 29:06.773
But Jackson's a
convicted bank robber.

29:06.981 --> 29:08.650
Why is he breaking
into a microchip plant?

29:09.025 --> 29:12.320
And stealing squat. Good question.

29:12.779 --> 29:16.240
A better one would be how he broke
into the plant in the first place.

29:16.407 --> 29:18.409
High tech's not exactly his style.

29:19.118 --> 29:20.953
Unless this was just a dry run.

29:21.120 --> 29:24.082
Maybe Mickey's looking
to do bigger and better things.

29:24.248 --> 29:26.167
Like another bank?

29:26.334 --> 29:28.878
Like a big bank.
It's a leap, I know.

29:29.045 --> 29:31.631
Agreed, but why the kid?

29:32.632 --> 29:34.842
How's he fit into this?

29:36.219 --> 29:38.304
<i>- Trudeau.
- Hey, Andy, it's Phoebe.</i>

29:38.513 --> 29:40.097
Have you seen Prue
since this morning?

29:40.306 --> 29:43.476
No, as a matter of fact, I was about
to ask you the same question.

29:43.684 --> 29:46.020
- Really? Why?
- Because I think she knows something

29:46.187 --> 29:47.813
about a boy named Max.

29:48.648 --> 29:50.024
<i>Do you?</i>

29:50.233 --> 29:54.904
Yeah, oh... Oh, that's my call waiting.
I gotta go. Could be Prue. Bye.

29:56.822 --> 29:57.865
Anything?

29:58.032 --> 30:00.660
No, I can't reach either Max
or Prue telepathically.

30:01.327 --> 30:03.329
Does that mean they're in trouble?

30:04.038 --> 30:05.456
Who's in trouble?

30:05.664 --> 30:07.792
Oh, the 49ers.

30:08.042 --> 30:11.337
No secondary. They need
a really good draft pick next year.

30:12.755 --> 30:17.009
Well, I'm gonna go into the kitchen
and see if I can get in touch with Prue.

30:17.301 --> 30:18.636
Carry on.

30:22.348 --> 30:24.099
Alone, finally.

30:24.266 --> 30:29.229
Don't have to worry about any more
interruptions from Harry. He quit.

30:30.981 --> 30:34.818
Okay, not the enthusiastic response
I was hoping for.

30:34.985 --> 30:41.241
Look, Piper, I've been searching all day
for an easy way to tell you this.

30:43.952 --> 30:45.662
Phoebe?

30:46.622 --> 30:49.374
Phoebe, I know you're
not in the kitchen.

30:49.792 --> 30:53.504
That is so weird.
I was just on my way back.

30:54.213 --> 30:57.466
Is Leo about to tell me he doesn't
wanna see me anymore?

31:04.640 --> 31:06.725
You'll have to ask him.

31:11.688 --> 31:14.608
And that's the problem. I fell in love
with you, and I shouldn't have.

31:14.816 --> 31:16.735
- You're married?
- No.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.862
Engaged?

31:19.154 --> 31:24.534
I'm involved,
but it's not the way you think.

31:24.743 --> 31:28.538
The truth is, is that I led you on and
made you believe I was coming back.

31:29.122 --> 31:31.208
Leo, you are back.

31:31.416 --> 31:34.628
Yeah, but I have to leave again now,

31:34.794 --> 31:38.548
and it's not because I want to, though.
It's because I have to.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.051
I'm sorry.

31:41.635 --> 31:43.261
That's okay.

31:44.179 --> 31:46.222
- It is?
- Yeah.

31:46.389 --> 31:49.059
I mean, Leo, you're a nice guy,
and I like you a lot,

31:49.225 --> 31:54.147
but let's face it,
you're geographically undesirable.

31:54.356 --> 31:56.483
I mean, you said you live
really far away, right?

31:56.649 --> 31:58.276
Yeah, pretty far.

31:59.027 --> 32:02.322
Well, I try never to get involved
with guys I can't see regularly,

32:02.489 --> 32:04.449
so don't feel bad.

32:04.657 --> 32:08.036
I mean, I understand.
Really, I do.

32:19.088 --> 32:22.508
- So how'd she take it?
- Not bad.

32:26.137 --> 32:29.932
Oh, excuse me, but I have to go.

32:30.266 --> 32:31.893
Leo, where are you going?

32:32.060 --> 32:35.605
I have to leave now.

32:41.944 --> 32:45.490
So the thing is,
once Max shorts out the alarm,

32:45.656 --> 32:49.577
we've got three minutes till the guards
realize there's a signal interruption.

32:49.744 --> 32:52.622
Just make sure the kid knows
what he's supposed to do.

32:52.788 --> 32:56.542
And keep an eye on that girl.
I don't trust her.

32:59.128 --> 33:02.131
Has anything like this
ever happened to you before?

33:03.507 --> 33:05.760
Not exactly like this.

33:05.926 --> 33:09.513
- Usually, the demons that I have to...
- Demons?

33:10.014 --> 33:13.768
Your mom didn't get to tell you much
about being a witch, did she?

33:13.934 --> 33:18.022
No. I had just found out about
my power when she died.

33:20.107 --> 33:23.360
You know, my mom died
when I was young too.

33:23.611 --> 33:25.863
I know how much it hurts.

33:26.030 --> 33:28.824
And it doesn't ever really go away.

33:29.950 --> 33:32.953
I didn't even know that
my power was coming.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.832
I've had to figure it out all by myself,
which means so can you.

33:37.458 --> 33:41.045
- Especially with your dad's help.
- He'll never understand.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.422
Max, you have to help him understand.

33:43.964 --> 33:46.216
You sound just like my mom.

33:47.885 --> 33:51.138
Well, I care a lot about you too.

33:51.305 --> 33:54.141
I wish you could be my mom right now.

33:55.809 --> 33:58.896
So, what is your power anyway?

33:59.605 --> 34:01.857
Mom called it psychokinesis.

34:02.024 --> 34:04.902
It means I can move things I can't see.

34:05.110 --> 34:10.239
All right, remember, just do everything
I say, and nobody gets hurt.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.867
Let's roll.

34:12.743 --> 34:15.036
- Max?
- Dad.

34:15.829 --> 34:17.414
Hold it. Hold it.

34:17.581 --> 34:19.541
Don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.251
Nobody else knows you're here.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.712
I found you the same way she did,
through your brother.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.547
Your brother?

34:25.755 --> 34:28.507
- Gordon, they have him wired.
- Shut up!

34:30.092 --> 34:33.138
- Dad.
- It's all right, son.

34:33.388 --> 34:36.891
Look, man, I'll give you
anything else you want,

34:37.058 --> 34:41.396
just let me have my boy, please.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.696
All right, David, go put them in the van.

34:50.112 --> 34:51.697
Do it.

34:54.409 --> 34:56.244
My son.

34:57.245 --> 34:58.580
Max?

34:58.788 --> 35:00.248
Max?

35:02.125 --> 35:05.170
Please, man, let him go.
I beg you, please, he's my son.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.338
Let him go. I beg you, please...

35:08.465 --> 35:09.966
Sorry.

35:22.270 --> 35:23.980
Drive.

35:40.997 --> 35:44.459
All right, it'll be just like
this morning, Max.

35:45.543 --> 35:49.881
That's where the alarm panel is.
You know the rest.

35:50.673 --> 35:54.427
- What are you looking at?
- What are you gonna do to my dad?

35:56.137 --> 36:01.309
Max, the sooner this is over,
the sooner we can get to him.

36:01.475 --> 36:03.519
We need to hurry.

36:28.002 --> 36:30.713
- Okay.
- Out.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.334
We got two minutes.

37:09.501 --> 37:11.753
All right, you get the cash.
I'll watch them.

37:21.888 --> 37:23.932
Use your power.

37:33.024 --> 37:35.485
I don't want you two getting any ideas.

37:44.870 --> 37:46.913
What the hell are you doing?

37:52.377 --> 37:54.212
That's the vault!

37:55.463 --> 37:57.215
Put it down!

37:58.675 --> 38:00.385
Hold it right there!

38:00.677 --> 38:02.012
Drop it!

38:07.851 --> 38:09.978
Big mistake.

38:14.983 --> 38:16.526
Yeah, right back at you.

38:24.534 --> 38:27.287
- Come on.
- Shouldn't we wait for the cops?

38:27.453 --> 38:30.665
- Explain everything?
- No, we cannot explain without telling.

38:30.832 --> 38:33.376
And you have to protect yourself
by protecting your secret.

38:33.543 --> 38:36.004
We really need to get back
to your dad, okay?

38:54.522 --> 38:55.857
Paulette.

39:04.740 --> 39:06.826
It's not time to be with
your wife, Gordon.

39:07.201 --> 39:08.661
It's time to be with your son.

39:09.036 --> 39:10.621
But...

39:21.716 --> 39:23.509
Raise the boy well.

39:23.676 --> 39:25.678
Heed Prue's advice.

39:50.786 --> 39:52.705
Dad. You okay?

39:52.913 --> 39:55.708
Max. Oh, I'm fine, Max.

39:55.874 --> 39:58.377
Thank you, God.
Thank you! Thank you!

39:58.544 --> 39:59.878
Oh, you're all right.

40:00.087 --> 40:02.339
But I saw you get...

40:03.006 --> 40:05.008
You're not bleeding.

40:05.676 --> 40:07.386
It's a miracle.

40:07.761 --> 40:09.429
Thank you.

40:09.888 --> 40:11.807
Thank you for protecting my son.

40:12.599 --> 40:14.893
I'm just glad it worked out.

40:16.979 --> 40:19.147
Raise the boy well.

40:21.233 --> 40:22.985
What?

40:25.195 --> 40:27.739
There's somewhere we need to go.

40:30.325 --> 40:32.786
I'd like you to come with us.

40:48.552 --> 40:51.304
Max, I was so busy being angry
at your mother for leaving,

40:51.471 --> 40:55.058
for not telling me her secret,
your secret.

40:55.225 --> 40:58.395
It was like a weight on my heart.

41:00.981 --> 41:03.608
I hope you both can forgive me.

41:33.346 --> 41:35.807
Can you believe that?
Dad's old train.

41:36.015 --> 41:39.352
I can't believe you. You get mad at me
for chasing monsters on my own.

41:39.852 --> 41:43.356
Well, I figured that I could handle it
when I realized they weren't demons,

41:43.523 --> 41:45.441
but I probably should've
asked for help.

41:45.608 --> 41:47.902
Even though that kills you.
And it almost did.

41:48.111 --> 41:49.779
Live and learn.

41:49.946 --> 41:53.449
Yeah, you didn't even get
to say goodbye to Leo.

41:53.658 --> 41:56.077
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know. It's weird,

41:56.244 --> 42:00.248
I felt like he was holding
something back from me.

42:00.414 --> 42:01.874
Holding back? What do you mean?

42:02.333 --> 42:06.462
Who knows? It just seemed like
he wasn't telling me the whole story,

42:06.629 --> 42:09.674
like he had some secret
he was afraid I couldn't handle.

42:09.882 --> 42:12.051
Well, that's his call.

42:13.678 --> 42:17.223
Assuming that he had a secret.
Might not have.

42:17.390 --> 42:18.724
What are you talking about?

42:18.933 --> 42:21.102
Okay, okay, you don't have
to beat it out of me.

42:21.268 --> 42:22.603
Leo is a whitelighter.

42:22.812 --> 42:24.689
They're sort of guardian
angels for witches.

42:25.272 --> 42:27.525
And they're not supposed
to get involved with witches,

42:27.733 --> 42:31.278
but Leo couldn't help it. He fell in love
with you, and that broke all the rules

42:31.487 --> 42:32.988
and got him in all sorts of trouble.

42:33.155 --> 42:37.785
And even though he'll love you forever,
you will probably never see him again.

42:42.623 --> 42:47.169
What? Phoebe, that's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

42:48.712 --> 42:50.631
Oh, God. Don't be so silly.

42:50.798 --> 42:54.259
- That's me: Silly.
- I'm gonna go get some more tea.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.012
Yeah, you know, Pheebs,
with an imagination like that,

42:57.179 --> 42:59.390
you should be writing
children's books or something.

42:59.598 --> 43:00.974
No, but I didn't...

43:02.559 --> 43:05.938
...even think of that.
That's a really good idea, Prue.

43:09.149 --> 43:11.443
That stays here.

43:12.111 --> 43:15.322
Wait, I thought all of the toys were
going to the Salvation Army.

43:15.781 --> 43:20.202
Well, like you said, we should
save some for our children.

43:20.494 --> 43:23.997
Do I sense a hormonal shift here?

43:24.790 --> 43:26.625
It's no big deal.

43:26.792 --> 43:28.669
I've just had some time to think.

43:28.877 --> 43:30.796
Yeah, in all that spare time of yours?

43:31.380 --> 43:34.800
And I realize that I do want kids.

43:34.967 --> 43:36.635
I think I'll make a great mom.

43:40.555 --> 43:43.392
So did you save Max...

43:43.558 --> 43:45.936
...or did Max save you?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
