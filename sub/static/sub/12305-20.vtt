00:09.211 --> 00:10.754
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

00:10.796 --> 00:12.005
<i>Uh, please help. He's bleeding.</i>

00:12.089 --> 00:14.800
<i>Okay, sir, who's
bleeding? Oh, my God, no.</i>

00:14.883 --> 00:16.218
<i>Uh, he's shooting them,
he's shooting them all!</i>

00:16.300 --> 00:18.804
<i>Who is, sir? Oh, my God, he just, uh...</i>

00:18.887 --> 00:20.389
<i>I think before that was his son.</i>

00:20.514 --> 00:21.473
<i>Please, please hurry-</i>

00:21.515 --> 00:22.516
<i>he's going after his daughter now.</i>

00:22.599 --> 00:24.101
<i>Sir, I need a little more information.</i>

00:24.184 --> 00:24.893
<i>What more do you need?</i>

00:25.018 --> 00:27.020
<i>They're dying. Stop
him. Sir, where are they?</i>

00:27.104 --> 00:28.480
<i>113 Coral Way.</i>

00:28.605 --> 00:30.607
<i>Patrol units will be
dispatched immediately.</i>

00:50.919 --> 00:51.712
Go, go, go!

00:52.504 --> 00:53.714
SWAT! SWAT!

00:58.385 --> 00:59.470
Drop your weapon!

00:59.511 --> 01:00.804
I'm not scared of you!

01:01.597 --> 01:03.098
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

01:17.905 --> 01:21.492
No! No!

01:53.399 --> 01:55.317
Sergeant, I'm confused.

01:55.984 --> 01:57.611
We had a credible threat, Lieutenant.

01:57.694 --> 01:59.113
Victim came at me with that knife.

01:59.196 --> 02:02.282
I don't see any blood on that knife.

02:03.784 --> 02:05.786
He didn't get close enough to stab me.

02:05.911 --> 02:08.788
So nobody actually got stabbed.

02:09.914 --> 02:11.792
Where is the family, Sergeant?

02:12.793 --> 02:14.420
Wife's outside with my men.

02:14.712 --> 02:15.879
What about the kids?

02:16.588 --> 02:17.715
Cleared the premises.

02:17.798 --> 02:19.216
No "next of" in the house.

02:22.886 --> 02:25.889
911 dispatch call said that
there were children in peril.

02:26.014 --> 02:29.810
Sergeant, it would appear that you
acted on unsubstantiated information.

02:29.893 --> 02:32.604
And we are very sorry
about the casualties...

02:33.397 --> 02:34.481
...sir.

02:34.606 --> 02:37.901
But tactically, Lieutenant,
we were in the right.

02:39.695 --> 02:40.988
Wait outside.

02:49.204 --> 02:50.205
No kids,

02:50.247 --> 02:51.206
no gun.

02:51.415 --> 02:53.709
He must have grabbed a
knife for self-defense.

02:54.501 --> 02:56.211
What the hell has happened here?

02:56.295 --> 03:00.382
Frank, it's called crime
scene investigation.

04:03.214 --> 04:04.924
I can't believe this is happening.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.134
Why would they shoot him?

04:10.137 --> 04:10.971
Mrs. Maddox,

04:11.013 --> 04:13.516
your husband was brandishing a knife.

04:13.933 --> 04:15.434
To protect me.

04:16.726 --> 04:18.521
To protect you from who, ma'am?

04:19.021 --> 04:20.564
Who do you think?

04:20.606 --> 04:22.107
From your men.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.111
We were just talking about his
business meeting later today,

04:26.237 --> 04:28.322
and they just burst in.

04:29.031 --> 04:31.909
I am gonna sue your department
for all that it's worth.

04:32.034 --> 04:32.827
Mrs. Maddox...

04:32.910 --> 04:36.330
My husband was a good man, Lieutenant,

04:36.539 --> 04:38.541
and you took him from me.

04:50.427 --> 04:52.179
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

04:52.221 --> 04:53.597
<i>Uh, please help. He's bleeding.</i>

04:53.681 --> 04:55.015
<i>Okay, sir, who's bleeding?</i>

04:55.141 --> 04:56.475
<i>Uh, the boy... the boy is.</i>

04:56.517 --> 04:59.228
<i>Sir, please, I'm going to
need some more information.</i>

04:59.311 --> 05:00.604
<i>where is he bleeding?</i>

05:00.646 --> 05:01.939
<i>I, uh, I can't tell.</i>

05:02.022 --> 05:03.941
<i>Oh, God, he just, uh, he
just picked it up again.</i>

05:04.024 --> 05:07.319
<i>Sir, please, I need you
to calm down and help me.</i>

05:07.403 --> 05:09.238
Is that the 911 call?

05:09.321 --> 05:12.825
Yeah, I got access to the E911
system, and luckily for us,

05:12.908 --> 05:15.035
they, uh, record every
call as soon as it comes in.

05:15.119 --> 05:15.911
<i>Uh, I can see him.</i>

05:16.036 --> 05:17.079
<i>Oh, my God, he just, uh...</i>

05:17.121 --> 05:18.414
<i>I think before that was his son.</i>

05:18.455 --> 05:19.498
<i>Please, please hurry-</i>

05:19.540 --> 05:20.708
<i>he's going after his daughter now.</i>

05:20.833 --> 05:23.335
<i>Sir, I need a little more
information. What more do you need?</i>

05:23.419 --> 05:26.338
<i>They're dying. Stop him. Sir,
please. I need a little more...</i>

05:27.715 --> 05:29.925
Can you tell where the call originated?

05:30.134 --> 05:32.636
Yeah. Automatic Location
Identification system

05:32.720 --> 05:34.430
takes every number and, uh,

05:34.513 --> 05:35.681
matches it to an address.

05:35.723 --> 05:37.141
So if the number's in the database,

05:37.183 --> 05:38.476
we're gonna find a house.

05:38.517 --> 05:39.810
<i>Sir, where are they?</i>

05:40.019 --> 05:41.395
<i>113 Coral Way.</i>

05:41.437 --> 05:43.814
<i>Patrol units will be
dispatched immediately.</i>

05:47.318 --> 05:48.861
Neil Jackson.

05:48.903 --> 05:50.404
109 Coral Way.

05:52.531 --> 05:54.325
That's next-door to the Maddox house.

05:56.410 --> 05:58.704
Do you know what
"swatting" is, Mr. Jackson?

06:00.039 --> 06:01.707
Killing flies?

06:02.541 --> 06:03.834
Try people.

06:03.918 --> 06:06.837
It's when someone places
fake phone call to 911,

06:06.921 --> 06:10.216
causing SWAT to respond
to a non-situation,

06:10.424 --> 06:12.510
and results in the
injury of innocent people.

06:12.635 --> 06:14.720
And why would I know what that is?

06:14.804 --> 06:17.014
Because a SWAT call
was made from your home

06:17.139 --> 06:19.141
and it caused the
death of Michael Maddox,

06:19.225 --> 06:20.601
your next-door neighbor.

06:20.726 --> 06:22.102
I wasn't even home this morning.

06:22.228 --> 06:25.022
The call center confirms that the
call came from your house, Neil.

06:26.732 --> 06:27.817
That's insane.

06:27.942 --> 06:29.527
Exclusive of the fact

06:29.735 --> 06:32.112
that I've got no reason
to want Michael dead.

06:32.530 --> 06:35.741
Well, there is that little
matter of his lawsuit against you.

06:38.702 --> 06:39.537
Look...

06:40.120 --> 06:42.832
I just wanted to put an
addition onto my house,

06:43.123 --> 06:46.836
crease the market value, but
Michael was dead set against it.

06:46.919 --> 06:48.212
He isn't anymore.

06:49.505 --> 06:52.133
I did not make that call.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.510
Then why don't you tell me who did?

07:00.933 --> 07:02.726
There was this guy, yesterday.

07:04.228 --> 07:05.729
I caught him hiding in my tree.

07:06.313 --> 07:07.523
What the hell are you doing?

07:10.818 --> 07:12.820
So you really expect me to believe

07:12.903 --> 07:15.614
that this same guy broke into
your house and made the call?

07:17.241 --> 07:19.034
All I know is that I didn't.

07:19.076 --> 07:19.910
Then I'm sure

07:20.035 --> 07:23.205
you won't mind waiting in
holding until I believe you.

07:30.713 --> 07:33.924
So, Calleigh ran Neil Jackson's
voice against the 911 recording,

07:34.008 --> 07:35.134
and there was no match.

07:35.217 --> 07:38.137
You know, there might be something
to this whole tree climber story.

07:38.637 --> 07:40.931
The only prints we found
on his phone were his own.

07:42.016 --> 07:43.017
Okay, well,

07:43.434 --> 07:45.102
then this tree might just break the tie.

07:52.401 --> 07:53.611
You got something?

07:54.528 --> 07:55.279
Yeah.

07:55.321 --> 07:56.530
Got some skin.

08:14.632 --> 08:15.841
Hey. Got anything?

08:15.925 --> 08:18.219
Yeah. The epithelials we
got in Neil Jackson's tree

08:18.302 --> 08:20.304
gave me the DNA profile on this guy.

08:22.515 --> 08:23.599
Kurt Rossi.

08:23.641 --> 08:25.017
Yeah, how do I know that name?

08:25.100 --> 08:26.602
He calls himself a private investigator.

08:26.727 --> 08:29.021
Got a long list of clients,
all with deep pockets.

08:29.104 --> 08:30.022
What's the big attraction?

08:30.105 --> 08:32.024
Big attraction, he'll
put his morals aside,

08:32.107 --> 08:34.610
so you don't have to, bends the
law to get people what they want.

08:34.735 --> 08:37.029
Based on his record, he looks like
he breaks the law quite a bit, too.

08:37.111 --> 08:38.614
He's got burglary,
obstruction of justice,

08:38.739 --> 08:40.908
false impersonation,
bribery of a witness.

08:41.241 --> 08:43.118
Look, he doesn't do the time, either.

08:43.327 --> 08:45.621
18 months probation? Who is this guy?

08:45.830 --> 08:47.331
He's our number one suspect.

08:51.502 --> 08:52.503
No means no, okay?

08:52.628 --> 08:55.005
No doesn't mean maybe, and no
doesn't mean "ask me again. "

08:55.131 --> 08:56.006
Okay?

08:57.925 --> 08:59.802
Get off the phone, please.

09:00.928 --> 09:01.929
I got to go.

09:13.315 --> 09:14.525
Lieutenant Caine.

09:15.526 --> 09:19.238
I understand you were on Neil
Jackson's property yesterday.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.616
I'm a private investigator
- I go a lot of places.

09:23.617 --> 09:26.120
What's so special about... that place?

09:26.203 --> 09:28.831
A phone call originated
from that property

09:28.914 --> 09:31.125
which got Michael Maddox killed.

09:32.501 --> 09:33.919
Why would I kill Michael?

09:34.211 --> 09:35.171
He's a nice guy.

09:35.212 --> 09:36.839
Good client, pays on time.

09:40.634 --> 09:41.802
You worked for him.

09:43.220 --> 09:44.805
Michael had doubts about his wife.

09:45.306 --> 09:47.433
He wanted me to find out
if she was cheating on him.

09:51.020 --> 09:53.230
<i>So I settled into those
branches hoping Lucy</i>

09:53.314 --> 09:55.024
<i>and her mystery man would show up.</i>

09:58.527 --> 10:01.739
Until Johnny Neighbor comes home, and...

10:05.326 --> 10:06.118
Hey!

10:06.535 --> 10:07.912
What the hell are you doing?

10:13.626 --> 10:15.002
Never got any of the dirt.

10:17.213 --> 10:19.840
No names, nothing?

10:22.009 --> 10:25.721
Michael hired me to do things his way,

10:26.806 --> 10:29.141
and that takes time.

10:29.725 --> 10:31.018
If it were up to me,

10:31.519 --> 10:35.815
I'd look Lucy Maddox in the
eye and ask her point-blank.

10:39.527 --> 10:41.320
Maybe I can help you with that.

10:56.335 --> 10:58.504
Hoping to talk me out of my lawsuit?

10:58.712 --> 11:01.215
Mrs. Maddox, were you having an affair?

11:02.508 --> 11:05.719
What on earth would make you ask
me such a thing at a time like this?

11:05.803 --> 11:08.722
I am merely trying to establish motive.

11:09.515 --> 11:10.933
Well, I'm not.

11:11.934 --> 11:12.726
As it turns out,

11:12.810 --> 11:18.816
your husband hired a private investigator,
a one Kurt Rossi, to spy on you.

11:20.317 --> 11:21.402
Of course.

11:23.028 --> 11:25.114
Michael saw conspiracies everywhere-

11:25.156 --> 11:27.324
at home, at work, in the news.

11:28.033 --> 11:30.035
I'm not surprised he hired that vermin.

11:30.077 --> 11:31.912
Who else was he concerned about?

11:32.913 --> 11:35.833
His business partner, Peter Cullen.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.835
They started a hedge fund.

11:37.877 --> 11:38.961
Michael wanted out,

11:39.003 --> 11:40.629
and Peter's fighting him.

11:40.671 --> 11:42.214
It only fueled his paranoia.

11:43.132 --> 11:44.383
My husband is dead,

11:44.425 --> 11:46.635
and you're coming to me with this.

11:47.428 --> 11:48.637
I am.

11:48.804 --> 11:51.140
Yeah, well, have it
your way, Lieutenant.

11:52.308 --> 11:54.018
Your SWAT team destroyed everything-

11:54.101 --> 11:57.605
even Michael's car, which I am adding
to the list of things that they ruined.

11:58.022 --> 11:59.315
His car?

11:59.607 --> 12:01.066
Smashed the front bumper in.

12:01.108 --> 12:04.028
I can't see any
possible reason for that.

12:08.032 --> 12:09.909
All right, I'm on it.

12:10.409 --> 12:11.327
Thanks.

12:13.412 --> 12:15.122
Wife tried to stonewall,

12:15.331 --> 12:17.124
throw suspicion on the business partner.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.502
Horatio called to tell you that?

12:19.627 --> 12:22.338
Called to say the wife
says SWAT damaged the car.

12:22.421 --> 12:24.215
But it's not their MO.

12:25.841 --> 12:27.927
Well, I can tell you
SWAT didn't do that.

12:28.010 --> 12:29.929
Silver paint, verity of damage,

12:29.970 --> 12:31.639
that's vehicular impact.

12:32.515 --> 12:34.642
It's an accident Lucy
Maddox didn't know about.

12:35.017 --> 12:36.936
Paint's still flaked and hanging on.

12:36.977 --> 12:38.103
Means it's recent.

12:39.313 --> 12:41.106
Could be relevant to the case.

12:44.109 --> 12:46.111
This car has an event data recorder.

12:46.821 --> 12:49.532
Means we're gonna be able to tell
who our victim had an accident with.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.126
So what exactly does this thing do?

13:01.210 --> 13:02.711
Documents accidents.

13:02.920 --> 13:05.339
It senses deceleration over 1 G-force

13:05.422 --> 13:07.925
and it automatically
records for 15 seconds.

13:08.008 --> 13:10.010
So if Maddox were in an accident today,

13:10.052 --> 13:11.178
the footage will be here?

13:11.220 --> 13:13.430
Yeah, and hopefully someone with motive.

13:15.015 --> 13:16.308
Well, you know what that means.

13:16.433 --> 13:20.729
It's possible the SWAT call was meant
to finish off Maddox after the accident.

13:21.021 --> 13:22.231
Got a plate.

13:26.527 --> 13:27.736
See that?

13:27.903 --> 13:29.321
I'm gonna put out a BOLO.

13:39.123 --> 13:40.624
Want to step out of the car, please?

13:47.631 --> 13:48.382
Did you, uh,

13:48.424 --> 13:50.009
have a little accident, Mr. Decker?

13:50.134 --> 13:51.302
Minor fender bender.

13:51.802 --> 13:53.471
That turned into something major.

13:53.512 --> 13:55.139
I'm sorry. Why was I pull over?

14:04.231 --> 14:05.524
"To Lucy. "

14:06.817 --> 14:09.111
You wouldn't happen to know
Michael Maddox, would you?

14:09.528 --> 14:10.613
No. Why?

14:10.821 --> 14:13.115
Because Lucy is his wife's name.

14:13.157 --> 14:14.366
Isn't that right, Frank?

14:14.408 --> 14:17.411
Yeah. Do you want to come clean, Romeo,

14:17.453 --> 14:18.829
or should I read the card?

14:21.916 --> 14:23.834
Lucy and I have been seeing each other.

14:23.876 --> 14:25.503
Her husband's this paranoid freak.

14:25.628 --> 14:28.214
Paranoid freak? You're
having n affair with his wife.

14:29.340 --> 14:30.633
We call that "motive. "

14:33.010 --> 14:34.303
You're gonna come with us.

14:40.811 --> 14:41.895
I didn't kill him.

14:41.937 --> 14:43.731
The accident was a freak coincidence.

14:43.814 --> 14:45.524
We didn't even stop to check for damage.

14:45.649 --> 14:48.027
Problem is Michael Maddox
had his car equipped

14:48.068 --> 14:49.820
with a video monitoring system.

14:50.029 --> 14:51.739
Caught you two having words.

14:56.410 --> 14:58.912
So would you like to change
your story now, Charlie?

14:59.038 --> 15:01.206
Okay, we got out of our cars,

15:01.248 --> 15:02.916
but it's an accident, tempers rise.

15:03.042 --> 15:06.545
Tempers rise and let
the killing begin, huh?

15:06.629 --> 15:09.715
Hey, he's the one who came
after me out of nowhere.

15:16.930 --> 15:19.350
What is wrong with you?
Didn't you see me coming?

15:19.725 --> 15:21.310
He was crazed. You know what he said?

15:21.352 --> 15:22.936
He said if I didn't stop seeing Lucy,

15:23.020 --> 15:25.522
he was gonna kill me. But
you didn't want to end things,

15:25.648 --> 15:27.316
so you beat him to the punch.

15:28.525 --> 15:30.277
I didn't kill Michael Maddox.

15:30.319 --> 15:32.112
I wasn't even at their
house this morning.

15:32.237 --> 15:35.616
You didn't need to be. All
you needed was your voice.

15:38.827 --> 15:40.746
I thought you said
all you had was video.

15:40.788 --> 15:42.122
Well, that's of the accident.

15:43.248 --> 15:44.917
So what's the recording of?

15:45.209 --> 15:46.418
The murder.

16:11.819 --> 16:14.613
You're still working on
the swatter's 911 call?

16:15.614 --> 16:18.033
Yeah, but I haven't hit
on any of the suspects yet.

16:18.117 --> 16:19.326
What about Kurt Rossi?

16:19.410 --> 16:21.161
No, not even our number one candidate

16:21.203 --> 16:22.913
for breaking into Neil Jackson's house.

16:23.831 --> 16:25.332
I did isolate a sound in the background

16:25.416 --> 16:28.544
hoping it would help us
to identify the 911 caller.

16:28.836 --> 16:30.379
And this is the noise I got.

16:30.421 --> 16:31.922
It's a low Doppler rumble.

16:32.631 --> 16:34.842
Sounds like a cannonball rolling by.

16:37.011 --> 16:37.928
I just can't figure it out.

16:38.012 --> 16:40.014
There's no match to the
voice or environment.

16:40.723 --> 16:42.725
What if the killer manipulated it?

16:42.850 --> 16:44.310
Will you play the call again?

16:52.735 --> 16:54.028
It's an airplane.

16:56.113 --> 16:58.115
The caller must have lowered
the pitch to mask their voice.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.118
Let me just recalibrate the
vocal track here for one second.

17:01.618 --> 17:03.120
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

17:03.162 --> 17:04.621
<i>Please help. He's bleeding!</i>

17:04.747 --> 17:07.333
<i>Okay, sir, who's bleeding?
The boy. The boy is.</i>

17:07.415 --> 17:08.709
I think I got it now.

17:09.042 --> 17:10.210
<i>Uh, please help. He's bleeding.</i>

17:10.294 --> 17:11.420
<i>Okay, sir. Who's bleeding?</i>

17:11.462 --> 17:12.546
<i>Uh, the boy. The boy is.</i>

17:12.630 --> 17:15.132
<i>Sir, I'm going to need
some more information.</i>

17:15.214 --> 17:16.634
<i>Where is he bleeding? Uh, I can't tell.</i>

17:16.717 --> 17:19.011
<i>I need you to calm down and help me.</i>

17:19.136 --> 17:22.222
<i>Oh, my God, now he, he's shooting
them! He's shooting them all!</i>

17:23.432 --> 17:26.644
I don't believe it. Our
911 caller's a woman.

17:26.935 --> 17:29.313
It could have been
Michael's wife, Lucy Maddox.

17:29.647 --> 17:31.815
No, she was inside the
house. It's impossible.

17:33.025 --> 17:35.444
Not unless you tamper with
a dedicated phone line.

17:35.527 --> 17:38.030
That way you can make it appear
a call came from any phone number.

17:38.113 --> 17:40.115
So you're saying that it's possible

17:40.240 --> 17:42.743
that the call didn't come
from Neil Jackson's house.

17:42.826 --> 17:45.037
Well, Lucy Maddox already
lied about the affair.

17:45.079 --> 17:46.121
I think it's time to bring her in.

17:46.246 --> 17:48.123
Let's just hold on that for a sec.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.334
'Cause if that call came from anywhere,

17:51.126 --> 17:53.545
give me a chance to figure
out just where anywhere is.

18:07.726 --> 18:09.645
Hey, you're not
authorized to be in there.

18:10.229 --> 18:11.605
This warrant says I am.

18:11.647 --> 18:14.400
But I tell you what's not authorized

18:14.441 --> 18:17.111
is for you to tamper with phone lines.

18:17.236 --> 18:18.445
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:18.487 --> 18:19.405
I'll explain to you.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.615
See this over here? This
is Neil Jackson's house.

18:21.824 --> 18:24.243
This is his phone line.
Everything looks normal.

18:24.618 --> 18:27.121
Except you follow these two wires down.

18:27.246 --> 18:30.541
You keep following them
down, following them down...

18:35.421 --> 18:38.841
And lo and behold,
there is a lineman set

18:39.425 --> 18:41.218
attached to his phone line.

18:41.343 --> 18:42.511
Don't know what it's doing in there.

18:42.553 --> 18:44.138
I'll explain that to you, too.

18:44.221 --> 18:47.850
This lineman set piggybacks
on Neil Jackson's phone line.

18:51.228 --> 18:52.813
<i>So when you make a call from it,</i>

18:53.939 --> 18:56.150
<i>it shows up on someone's
caller I.D. as Neil's phone.</i>

18:59.611 --> 19:00.821
Why'd you do this?

19:01.030 --> 19:02.948
I did it for a little side money.

19:03.449 --> 19:04.825
A little side money.

19:05.409 --> 19:06.535
Who paid you?

19:06.618 --> 19:07.828
Paid for my silence, too.

19:07.911 --> 19:10.247
I don't think you understand the
seriousness of this situation.

19:10.331 --> 19:12.124
Because of your little innovation here,

19:13.417 --> 19:15.044
somebody was murdered today.

19:16.837 --> 19:19.048
Hey, my boss finds out,
I'm gonna lose my job.

19:19.131 --> 19:22.217
You already lost your job, but
if you want to save your ass,

19:22.843 --> 19:24.345
you're gonna trace the number

19:25.220 --> 19:27.139
to whoever's piggybacking off of Neil.

19:33.145 --> 19:35.314
You've reached Debby Schiffer,
assistant to Peter Cullen.

19:35.439 --> 19:37.650
Leave a message and I'll
get right back to you.

19:42.237 --> 19:43.447
Hey, Horatio,

19:43.739 --> 19:46.241
you might want to visit
Michael Maddox's partner...

19:47.409 --> 19:50.329
because the 911 phone
call came from his office.

19:55.334 --> 19:57.628
Security says that's Debbie's desk.

19:58.712 --> 20:00.923
We may be too late. Debbie's not here.

20:04.134 --> 20:06.345
Ms. Boa Vista, take a look at this.

20:12.810 --> 20:14.436
A voice transformer.

20:14.645 --> 20:16.313
Well, that pretty much
sinks her, doesn't it?

20:16.438 --> 20:18.440
Yes.

20:18.524 --> 20:22.736
You speak into the headset,
adjust the pitch of your voice

20:24.947 --> 20:27.032
and you become someone else.

20:27.449 --> 20:29.410
My God! Now he, he's stabbing them!

20:29.618 --> 20:30.828
He's stabbing them all!

20:31.537 --> 20:33.038
Got our murder weapon.

20:38.919 --> 20:40.004
If you're with the media,

20:40.045 --> 20:41.588
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

20:41.630 --> 20:43.132
We're not with the media, Mr. Cullen.

20:43.173 --> 20:45.134
We're with Miami-Dade PD.

20:46.343 --> 20:48.345
We've been getting a lot of
calls about Michael's death.

20:48.429 --> 20:52.349
Mr. Cullen, are you aware that your
assistant placed the call that got him killed?

20:53.434 --> 20:55.227
Debbie's the one who called SWAT?

20:57.146 --> 20:58.522
I'm amazed.

20:59.148 --> 21:00.733
Debbie hated the fact that Michael

21:00.774 --> 21:02.026
was selling off the company.

21:02.943 --> 21:05.946
She was scared she would get
downsized, lose her townhouse.

21:06.739 --> 21:09.742
Debbie's Type A, but this is extreme.

21:09.783 --> 21:11.118
Where is she now?

21:11.618 --> 21:13.746
She ran down to her
car to get something.

21:14.121 --> 21:15.539
I'm surprised she isn't back yet.

21:15.581 --> 21:18.042
Are you? Stay here.

21:54.036 --> 21:55.329
It's Debby Schiffer.

21:58.916 --> 21:59.875
Still warm.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.168
Bullet's still inside.

22:01.210 --> 22:03.420
Let's get it to Ballistics. Natalia,

22:03.629 --> 22:05.547
no more collateral damage.

22:05.589 --> 22:06.215
Done.

22:21.021 --> 22:22.606
This is a private office!

22:22.690 --> 22:24.233
Sorry, pal, I got a warrant.

22:24.942 --> 22:26.610
What exactly are you looking for?

22:26.652 --> 22:28.028
Gunshot residue.

22:28.821 --> 22:30.823
So you think I shot my assistant?

22:31.448 --> 22:32.741
We did our homework.

22:33.033 --> 22:36.120
<i>Miami Herald's devoted a lot of
ink to you and Michael recently.</i>

22:38.038 --> 22:41.542
"Acrimonious" is the word they're using.

22:41.625 --> 22:43.043
It all fits, Mr. Cullen.

22:43.127 --> 22:46.547
You get Debbie to make your
fake 911 call, your partner dies

22:46.630 --> 22:49.425
as does the threat to
dissolving your company,

22:49.550 --> 22:51.635
and you silence your accomplice.

22:51.927 --> 22:53.137
Hands out, please.

22:55.431 --> 22:57.141
He wanted to sell, I didn't.

22:57.349 --> 22:59.810
How that adds up to murder is beyond me.

23:01.011 --> 23:03.138
Paper said you'd been
hemorrhaging clients and cash

23:03.222 --> 23:06.016
to the tune of about a hundred
thou a day by your own quotes.

23:06.141 --> 23:08.227
Now if that's not motive,
I don't know what is.

23:09.811 --> 23:10.938
I see.

23:15.108 --> 23:18.612
So, Miss Duquesne, find anything?

23:19.530 --> 23:20.280
No, I didn't.

23:20.322 --> 23:22.032
I'mgoing to need your jacket.

23:25.035 --> 23:25.744
Here.

23:26.036 --> 23:27.412
I have better things to do.

23:27.830 --> 23:29.540
I don't think so, Mr. Cullen.

23:55.941 --> 23:58.318
You washed the GSR off your hands.

23:59.528 --> 24:00.821
Take him downtown.

24:15.544 --> 24:17.421
You here for the Maddox case, Kurt?

24:18.046 --> 24:19.047
Lieutenant.

24:20.424 --> 24:22.134
Oh, no, no. Um...

24:23.343 --> 24:24.344
About a young lady named...

24:24.386 --> 24:25.345
Schiffer.

24:25.512 --> 24:26.346
Yeah.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.849
I guess we can safely assume
you'll work for anybody

24:28.932 --> 24:30.726
as long as the price is right.

24:31.643 --> 24:32.644
Not for you.

24:36.231 --> 24:37.733
You've got nothing on Peter Cullen.

24:37.816 --> 24:39.193
You mean, except for the gun.

24:39.234 --> 24:41.612
Off a search warrant
obtained by Calleigh Duquesne.

24:45.824 --> 24:47.576
My firearms expert.

24:47.618 --> 24:49.536
Which is the only reason
the warrant was issued.

24:49.828 --> 24:50.829
Not true, Kurt.

24:51.538 --> 24:53.624
But I can make people
believe that it is. Okay?

24:54.917 --> 24:58.420
So lose your warrant. Lose your case.

24:59.213 --> 25:00.422
Drop this.

25:00.631 --> 25:03.717
Peter Cullen is not your guy.

25:03.842 --> 25:06.637
I don't agree with that, either, Kurt.

25:09.223 --> 25:10.849
We don't agree about much, do we?

25:10.891 --> 25:11.725
No.

25:12.726 --> 25:13.936
Then game on.

25:14.144 --> 25:15.729
One thing you'll learn about me,

25:16.146 --> 25:19.650
I got eyes, ears everywhere.

25:22.444 --> 25:23.946
Join the club.

25:36.834 --> 25:37.835
Mr. Caine.

25:38.335 --> 25:40.128
I'd love to chat, Rick,
but this is important.

25:40.212 --> 25:41.421
Can it wait?

25:42.339 --> 25:44.132
No, it can't. Your evidence is tainted,

25:44.216 --> 25:46.343
and I have to pull you
off this case. What?

25:46.426 --> 25:47.594
Remember the Website

25:47.636 --> 25:49.513
"Solve a Crime With Calleigh"?

25:50.013 --> 25:51.515
Damage is still being done.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.309
There's a a video of you on it,
reading off a piece of paper.

26:02.317 --> 26:04.111
Those are my notes. What of it?

26:04.152 --> 26:05.529
"Crime Scene recognition.

26:05.571 --> 26:06.947
Documentation. Collection. "

26:07.030 --> 26:09.324
It was basically a checklist
of how to process a crime scene,

26:09.449 --> 26:10.826
as if you didn't know how.

26:11.827 --> 26:14.621
Yeah. That was the Website
that almost got me killed.

26:14.746 --> 26:15.622
I remember it.

26:16.331 --> 26:18.041
Well, it could be made to appear

26:18.083 --> 26:19.668
as though you tampered with evidence

26:19.710 --> 26:21.712
or cleaned up a crime
scene for two criminals.

26:21.837 --> 26:25.424
To save my own life. This
is Rossi's doing, isn't it?

26:25.841 --> 26:27.718
Trust me. I know you're a hero.

26:27.843 --> 26:29.219
The department knows you're a hero.

26:29.344 --> 26:30.596
Okay, so what are you saying?

26:30.637 --> 26:31.847
He can get inside people's minds

26:31.889 --> 26:33.098
and change them?

26:33.140 --> 26:34.641
We have to play by the rules.

26:34.683 --> 26:35.225
He doesn't.

26:35.309 --> 26:37.144
He took it to the State Attorney.

26:38.937 --> 26:40.272
Okay, so you're telling me

26:40.314 --> 26:42.149
that I am probably sitting
on the murder weapon,

26:42.232 --> 26:44.026
and yet I can't do anything about it?

26:44.818 --> 26:46.737
Way I see it is there's only one option.

26:46.820 --> 26:47.529
No.

26:48.822 --> 26:51.116
There is always more than one option.

26:51.158 --> 26:52.618
Get him to change his mind back.

26:52.743 --> 26:54.620
I don't care. I'll do whatever it takes.

26:55.913 --> 26:57.122
I am sorry.

27:00.334 --> 27:01.418
Okay, so you're telling me

27:01.543 --> 27:03.128
that I've been on the
force for ten years,

27:03.170 --> 27:05.047
and yet I still have to prove myself?

27:06.048 --> 27:07.382
System isn't perfect.

27:07.424 --> 27:09.426
And yet it still demands perfection.

27:40.328 --> 27:41.204
Calleigh, I just heard.

27:41.246 --> 27:42.747
Why didn't you tell Stetler the truth?

27:42.789 --> 27:44.124
That the notes were mine.

27:46.418 --> 27:49.045
Okay, about the sheet, here's the thing.

27:49.921 --> 27:51.256
You know, after you were shot,

27:51.339 --> 27:52.632
you came back to work pretty fast.

27:52.674 --> 27:54.426
And maybe it was too fast.

27:54.843 --> 27:56.428
And I guess I was just so happy

27:56.470 --> 27:57.596
that you were okay

27:57.637 --> 27:58.889
that I didn't say anything.

27:58.930 --> 28:00.307
And I probably should have.

28:00.348 --> 28:01.725
Say anything about what?

28:01.766 --> 28:03.435
Well, are you okay?

28:06.813 --> 28:08.440
We never talk about it.

28:08.732 --> 28:10.317
You never talk about it.

28:20.827 --> 28:22.245
It's a process.

28:23.538 --> 28:25.415
And the medication helps.

28:25.749 --> 28:27.250
And therapy helps.

28:28.710 --> 28:31.630
And I make a few little notes
here and there and that helps.

28:34.216 --> 28:35.926
Well, I have to say something.

28:40.222 --> 28:42.724
Because I feel for
you, and you know that.

28:45.519 --> 28:48.522
But if one memory lapse
allowed a killer to go free...

28:48.647 --> 28:51.316
I would've turned in my badge
a long time ago. You know that.

28:52.651 --> 28:54.027
I'm re-training my brain, Calleigh.

28:54.111 --> 28:56.113
But I know how to do my job.

28:57.239 --> 28:58.740
What about the cheat sheet?

28:58.824 --> 29:01.034
Why does everyone keep calling it that?

29:02.119 --> 29:04.329
Work isn't a test that you take.

29:04.538 --> 29:06.623
It's something you do right. Every time.

29:07.332 --> 29:09.626
So what if I take a few notes?

29:11.828 --> 29:13.038
Would it make you feel better to know

29:13.121 --> 29:15.332
that I've never
consulted them, not once?

29:16.416 --> 29:17.917
Look, you know what? I'm
going to got to Stetler myself.

29:18.043 --> 29:19.044
I'm going to tell him everything.

29:19.085 --> 29:20.128
Don't.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.131
Here's the thing, I'm off
the case, but you're not.

29:23.214 --> 29:24.424
Find another way to get the guy.

29:24.466 --> 29:26.343
I know you can do that.

29:26.509 --> 29:28.011
Do that instead.

29:29.012 --> 29:30.221
For us.

29:36.645 --> 29:37.646
All right.

29:53.244 --> 29:56.247
This private investigator's
got everybody scrambling, huh?

29:57.332 --> 29:58.541
What are you doing here?

30:00.919 --> 30:03.421
Checking Peter Cullen's jacket for GSR.

30:03.838 --> 30:05.215
I thought Calleigh already tested it.

30:05.256 --> 30:06.716
And she didn't find any.

30:06.758 --> 30:07.926
Not necessarily.

30:08.218 --> 30:10.637
So then why wouldn't the sodium
rhodizonate pick up on it?

30:10.720 --> 30:13.139
Because there's GSR, and there's GSM.

30:14.224 --> 30:15.350
GSM?

30:15.433 --> 30:16.893
Gunshot mist.

30:16.935 --> 30:18.019
I'm using a new method

30:18.144 --> 30:21.231
that detects microscopic metal
particles on dark surfaces.

30:21.314 --> 30:22.816
With liquid nitrogen?

30:22.857 --> 30:23.525
Yeah.

30:23.650 --> 30:26.945
Well, combine it with hydrochloric acid,

30:27.445 --> 30:30.323
lead and antimony
become photoluminescent.

30:32.325 --> 30:33.827
You can detect the tiniest remnants

30:33.868 --> 30:35.328
of a gun being fired.

30:48.216 --> 30:50.343
You're really putting in
quite the effort on this one.

30:50.427 --> 30:53.138
It's my fault that we can't use
the evidence Calleigh gathered.

31:10.322 --> 31:11.531
You got him.

31:12.741 --> 31:13.742
Yeah.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.250
What's your private investigator
doing here, Mr. Cullen?

31:23.209 --> 31:24.919
He is representing me.

31:25.045 --> 31:26.629
Dusted off my old degrees.

31:26.671 --> 31:27.839
You're a lawyer, too?

31:27.922 --> 31:29.841
I'm whatever my clients need me to be.

31:30.133 --> 31:31.718
Well, today I hope you're a miracle.

31:32.010 --> 31:33.720
Because that's what your client needs.

31:35.638 --> 31:37.724
We found GSM on your jacket.

31:47.817 --> 31:50.612
Never happened. We have
evidence that says different.

31:52.322 --> 31:54.324
Sometimes it's not about the evidence,

31:55.533 --> 31:57.619
it's about who collected
it. You're right.

31:58.328 --> 31:59.829
It wasn't CSI Duquesne this time.

31:59.871 --> 32:00.914
It was me.

32:01.623 --> 32:02.540
Exactly.

32:04.417 --> 32:05.335
Here.

32:05.710 --> 32:08.213
Eric, how have you been coping at work?

32:09.631 --> 32:11.132
Every day is different.

32:12.050 --> 32:15.720
I Thought I'd be back in,
uh, my daily rituals by now.

32:17.430 --> 32:19.140
I thought I'd be a hundred percent,

32:19.516 --> 32:20.642
but it's taking a long time.

32:20.725 --> 32:22.644
It's only been a month
since the shooting.

32:22.727 --> 32:24.020
And that frustrates you?

32:24.062 --> 32:25.021
Of course.

32:25.730 --> 32:28.525
I have to be really
methodical about everything.

32:28.942 --> 32:29.776
Even dumb stuff.

32:29.818 --> 32:31.611
Writing checks, I can't...

32:34.239 --> 32:36.116
...I can't remember what
year it is sometimes.

32:36.157 --> 32:37.701
And do you feel like

32:37.742 --> 32:40.829
your coworkers are
distancing themselves?

32:41.121 --> 32:42.247
No. Not at all.

32:42.831 --> 32:45.125
In fact, there's this one
woman that I work with.

32:45.250 --> 32:46.626
Uh, her name's Calleigh.

32:47.627 --> 32:49.129
Huh. How did you get that?

32:49.170 --> 32:50.547
People send me things.

32:50.588 --> 32:51.923
I hang on to them.

32:52.048 --> 32:53.425
You never know when
it might come in handy.

32:53.550 --> 32:56.219
That's from a confidential
session, and unfortunately

32:56.344 --> 32:58.221
your recording has nothing
to do with our case.

32:58.346 --> 32:59.639
Except that it...

33:00.932 --> 33:03.727
ruins Eric Delko's credibility

33:03.768 --> 33:05.228
as an investigator.

33:05.812 --> 33:08.023
I processed every piece of
evidence in this case by the book.

33:08.148 --> 33:10.817
Who's gonna believe that when you
don't even know what decade we're in?

33:10.942 --> 33:12.110
That's not what I said.

33:13.445 --> 33:15.113
Well, that's what it sounds like.

33:15.822 --> 33:18.533
Now, while you guys pursue this case,

33:19.326 --> 33:20.285
this recording

33:20.327 --> 33:22.412
and a dozen more like
it will be on YouTube.

33:22.454 --> 33:23.330
So...

33:25.040 --> 33:27.125
do you want to arrest my guy?

33:29.627 --> 33:30.628
Or not?

33:40.221 --> 33:41.514
Get out of here.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.515
Let's go.

33:43.725 --> 33:46.019
Still have time to get
our table at the Fenston.

33:53.443 --> 33:54.527
You heard what happened.

33:54.819 --> 33:55.820
I did.

33:55.945 --> 33:57.322
First Calleigh. Now me.

33:58.031 --> 33:58.782
Rossi's behind all this.

33:58.823 --> 33:59.949
And he's going to get away with murder.

33:59.991 --> 34:01.618
No, he's not, Eric.

34:02.410 --> 34:04.037
But we don't know
what else he has on us.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.539
It doesn't matter what
he has on us. Why not?

34:06.831 --> 34:09.542
Because we're going
to destroing him first.

34:24.592 --> 34:26.678
Eric told me I'd find you down here.

34:27.261 --> 34:30.264
You know, it is killing him
that he can't work on this case.

34:30.681 --> 34:32.558
Well, let's close the case then.

34:32.684 --> 34:36.187
What we need is to go
back to the beginning.

34:36.228 --> 34:37.772
Back to the SWAT team.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.565
'Cause everything else
is right up Rossi's alley.

34:40.775 --> 34:42.527
The piggybacking of the phone lines,

34:42.568 --> 34:44.277
the voice modulation, the surveillance.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.155
But how do we connect this to him?

34:46.489 --> 34:47.989
The inciting incident.

34:48.074 --> 34:51.077
He had to make sure that Michael
Maddox would rush the SWAT team.

34:51.159 --> 34:54.163
So therefore the
confrontation was created.

34:54.288 --> 34:55.665
Where does that leave us?

34:56.791 --> 34:58.584
That leaves us right here.

35:00.086 --> 35:02.672
This paint transfer's
too high on the car.

35:09.262 --> 35:10.888
The custom bumper on the Escalade

35:10.972 --> 35:13.766
makes ground clearance on
both cars the same height.

35:13.891 --> 35:15.768
So if the cars hit normally,

35:15.977 --> 35:18.187
then the paint transfer
should be only on the bumper.

35:18.271 --> 35:20.773
Unless Mr. Decker jammed on his brakes.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.275
Lowering the front of his car.

35:22.316 --> 35:23.985
Causing the accident.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.459
So Charlie Decker
targeted Michael Maddox.

35:42.086 --> 35:43.963
So you lied to me, Charlie.

35:44.255 --> 35:45.256
About what?

35:45.298 --> 35:46.257
You told me

35:46.382 --> 35:48.760
that Michael Maddox came at you.

35:49.177 --> 35:50.678
Yeah. You saw the video.

35:50.720 --> 35:51.554
I did.

35:51.679 --> 35:54.057
And I believe that you
hit him with intention.

35:55.183 --> 35:56.768
Now why would I do that?

35:56.976 --> 35:58.978
Kurt Rossi, Charlie.

36:01.981 --> 36:02.857
Kurt Rossi?

36:02.982 --> 36:04.484
The big P.I.?

36:05.068 --> 36:06.361
I've heard of him.

36:09.072 --> 36:10.365
Charlie Decker.

36:12.992 --> 36:13.826
Do I know you?

36:13.868 --> 36:15.370
You can call me Rossi.

36:15.453 --> 36:17.580
I know you're sleeping with Lucy Maddox.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.378
And I know that her
husband just found out.

36:23.461 --> 36:25.588
Oh, God, are you here to...?
Look, I'm on your side.

36:25.963 --> 36:26.964
Charlie...

36:27.757 --> 36:30.760
you can continue protecting Mr. Rossi,

36:30.968 --> 36:33.262
or start taking care of yourself.

36:36.057 --> 36:38.267
Okay. Okay.

36:39.769 --> 36:42.772
Somehow, Kurt knew about me and Lucy.

36:43.356 --> 36:45.191
That I was completely crazy about her.

36:46.275 --> 36:47.652
Now you love her, right?

36:48.361 --> 36:49.362
Yeah.

36:50.780 --> 36:52.281
Then here's what you're going to do.

36:57.453 --> 36:59.497
So he told me to stage an accident

36:59.580 --> 37:01.582
and then he'd take care of the rest.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.588
What is wrong with you?
Didn't you see me coming?

37:07.672 --> 37:10.174
Sure I did... Michael.

37:10.258 --> 37:12.969
I'm Charlie Decker. You know who I am.

37:13.052 --> 37:13.886
Look...

37:14.971 --> 37:16.389
you stay away from my wife, all right?

37:16.472 --> 37:17.974
What are you going to do about it, huh?

37:18.016 --> 37:19.267
I'll tell you what,

37:19.392 --> 37:20.852
I'll give you some time to think,

37:20.977 --> 37:22.854
but when I come into
your house to take Lucy,

37:22.979 --> 37:25.857
I hope you are man enough to fight back.

37:32.655 --> 37:34.490
That's him! Don't do this!

37:34.657 --> 37:35.491
No!

37:35.867 --> 37:37.118
I am not scared of you.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.579
Michael, this will
kill me! Don't do this!

37:46.753 --> 37:49.380
What am I supposed to do
now? Give me the rest of it.

37:51.758 --> 37:53.092
I can't do that.

37:54.969 --> 37:56.179
Okay, Charlie.

37:58.389 --> 38:00.975
Then I guess I just
have to accept his offer.

38:02.769 --> 38:03.561
Whato you mean?

38:03.603 --> 38:04.729
Mr. Rossi

38:04.771 --> 38:07.065
claims that you planned the whole thing.

38:07.357 --> 38:08.483
He said that?

38:08.524 --> 38:09.567
Mm-hmm.

38:10.777 --> 38:11.778
So...

38:12.862 --> 38:14.655
what do you want to do?

38:45.061 --> 38:47.188
I'll have your best bourbon, neat.

38:47.563 --> 38:48.981
Put it on their bill.

38:52.485 --> 38:54.570
You double-crossed me.

38:55.363 --> 38:56.572
What are you talking about?

38:56.781 --> 38:58.866
I teed up Michael Maddox
for you and you sell me out?

38:58.991 --> 39:00.451
Who is this guy, Kurt?

39:00.576 --> 39:01.661
He's nobody.

39:01.953 --> 39:03.788
Get out of here, Decker,
before you get hurt.

39:05.373 --> 39:07.667
Yeah? Like you hurt Michael?

39:11.754 --> 39:15.967
Our business is concluded.

39:16.759 --> 39:18.261
You're calling what we did business?

39:18.302 --> 39:18.720
Yeah.

39:18.761 --> 39:20.471
What the hell is he talking about?

39:20.513 --> 39:22.181
Yeah, Kurt, why don't you tell him?

39:29.564 --> 39:30.773
You want to know...

39:31.774 --> 39:32.775
what I did?

39:36.988 --> 39:37.864
Peter...

39:45.371 --> 39:46.789
I saved your ass.

39:47.582 --> 39:49.292
Do you think I'm stupid?

39:51.085 --> 39:53.880
'Cause I smell these across a room.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.261
Who are you to try to take me down?

40:00.386 --> 40:03.473
Okay, listen, guys... I'm sorry, okay?

40:03.556 --> 40:05.558
I didn't have another option, ll right?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.185
They had me dead to rights.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.563
Yeah? My secretary was
worried about that same thing.

40:10.688 --> 40:11.856
You know what happened to her?

40:11.898 --> 40:12.690
No.

40:16.652 --> 40:18.363
I put one in her chest.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.782
Guys look, listen to me, okay?

40:20.865 --> 40:21.949
I will clam up.

40:21.991 --> 40:24.452
I will do the time. I will disappear.

40:31.459 --> 40:32.752
You believe this guy?

40:33.878 --> 40:35.171
This dead ttle man?

40:45.556 --> 40:47.225
I got SWAT to kill Michael Maddox.

40:47.266 --> 40:49.185
You don't think I can
get to you in prison, huh?

40:56.776 --> 40:58.486
That'll be all, Mr. Decker.

41:05.159 --> 41:06.869
You taught him well, Kurt.

41:06.953 --> 41:09.080
Hey, nice try, Caine.

41:09.664 --> 41:10.707
Really, um...

41:10.748 --> 41:11.791
you got nothing.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.876
I already found your wire.

41:13.918 --> 41:15.753
Not all the wires, Kurt.

41:24.262 --> 41:27.390
And thank you, Kurt,
for having a big mouth.

41:27.473 --> 41:30.351
You guaranteed this could
never be traced back to me!

41:33.354 --> 41:35.857
If I testify on his
involvement with Maddox,

41:36.065 --> 41:37.483
maybe we can make a deal?

41:38.484 --> 41:41.362
Like rats off a sinking ship, huh, Kurt?

41:44.282 --> 41:45.783
My offer still stands.

41:45.825 --> 41:46.492
Mm.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.286
Come on.

41:48.661 --> 41:52.373
Do you want your lab's dirty
secrets hung out to dry?

41:53.374 --> 41:57.962
Kurt, your offer is meaningless now,

41:58.004 --> 42:00.381
just like you.

42:01.883 --> 42:02.967
Ca-Caine?

42:05.261 --> 42:06.262
Caine!

42:19.484 --> 42:21.986
So this is Rossi's private vault.

42:24.489 --> 42:27.867
I can't even imagine
what must be on all these.

42:33.081 --> 42:34.957
Before, about Stetler...

42:35.666 --> 42:36.876
It's our secret.

42:37.168 --> 42:39.379
We'll keep it between you and me, okay?

42:43.091 --> 42:44.175
Thanks.

42:45.093 --> 42:47.470
Let's hurry up, this
place gives me the creeps.
