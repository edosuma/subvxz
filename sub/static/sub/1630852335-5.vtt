Ideally, I'm looking for one
investor who is involved

10:07.173 --> 10:10.675
In the video game market and
understands why a product like

10:10.743 --> 10:13.278

think long overdue.

[manjit] oh!

10:19.919 --> 10:21.719
...And we would love to invite
you to help us demonstrate

10:21.788 --> 10:22.920
How to put one together.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.122
Okay, so what do we do?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.256
[andrew] so I can either give
you kind of the teacher

10:25.324 --> 10:28.259
Explanation, or it's kind of
like a puzzle if you prefer

10:28.327 --> 10:29.628
That method instead.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.863
Let them figure it out.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.199
[dianne] andrew's designed the
tables in five different colours

10:34.267 --> 10:36.368
Made out of mdf, or medium
density fibreboard.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.470
[manjit] are you sure all the
pieces are here, andrew?

10:39.539 --> 10:41.740

could do this, okay?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.175

-[manjit] I know!

10:44.243 --> 10:45.710
Ah, michele, so close!

10:45.778 --> 10:48.579

easy with a finger lock system

10:48.648 --> 10:50.314

$300 each.

11:02.762 --> 11:03.962
[michele] but this is so
strange.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.797
Like, now you're just supposed
to play video games like this?

11:05.799 --> 11:08.033
[andrew] you've probably got
it--

11:08.101 --> 11:09.234
[vincenzo] too high.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.835
[andrew] well, you got it
backwards, and then the

11:10.903 --> 11:13.371
Incline--so then take that
platform piece and flip

11:13.440 --> 11:16.340
It the opposite--yeah, yeah,
there you go.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.810
So your chairs are really high
up.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.344

not really gonna work.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.413
[manjit] yeah, okay.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.815
What you can do though is you
can add a third box

11:23.883 --> 11:26.718
Into the neck, and that would
essentially make it up to

11:26.786 --> 11:27.585
That height of that chair.

11:27.653 --> 11:28.586
It's literally like building
lego.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.088
-It's customizable.
-Yeah, yeah.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.257
But this doesn't feel very
stable.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.426

I would just knock it all over.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.563

like leaning your upper body

11:38.631 --> 11:39.864

I think it does if you don't
understand the market

14:37.243 --> 14:38.375
[vincenzo] so, andrew--

So the whole point is that when
people don't understand

14:40.246 --> 14:41.512
Your market you have to bring
proof points.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.581
You have to bring, "this is what
the medical community thinks,"

think."

[dianne] shoppers with the
coinmiles app can then cash in

17:51.370 --> 17:52.770
Their credits whenever they
choose.

17:53.772 --> 17:56.407
[dave] we're now over two-thirds

17:56.475 --> 17:59.276
That either own or are
interested in owning

17:59.345 --> 18:00.278
Crypto currencies.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.379
Coinmiles is here to enable
brands to capture

18:02.448 --> 18:03.414
This potential.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.917

or ebates with the option

18:06.986 --> 18:09.454
To get paid in bitcoin versus
getting paid in cash?

18:09.522 --> 18:10.787
There's one more element to it.

18:10.857 --> 18:14.024
We do the online cash-back as
well, but we also do in-store.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.526
We don't issue any credit cards
at coinmiles.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.793
Yeah.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.963
[dave] you link your own credit
card in the app, and each time

18:19.031 --> 18:22.400
You use your card to shop at a
participating partners,

bitcoin in the app.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.805

program, right, at its heart?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.541
It is a reward program that--and
some brands also--

18:30.543 --> 18:33.344
Reward for being loyal to
whoever the partner is, yes.

18:33.412 --> 18:34.345
[dave] that's correct.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.680
[manjit] so how do you make
money?

18:35.682 --> 18:38.082
[dave] the deal we get with most
merchants is on a 50/50 deal,

18:38.084 --> 18:42.386
So if the merchants wants to
offer 20% commission

18:42.454 --> 18:43.621
On a customer we bring in-store,
we keep,

18:43.689 --> 18:46.757
10% we give 10%
back to the user.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.562
[wes] you said you did $1.5
million in sales

18:51.630 --> 18:52.563
For your partners.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.499
-[dave] yes.
-How much did you do for you?

18:54.567 --> 18:59.170
The company generated close to
$100,000 from January this year,

18:59.238 --> 19:03.607
And the net revenue is slightly
over $40,000 for coinmiles.

19:03.676 --> 19:07.044
Right now, there's so many
rewards programs.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.713
Is it enough because other
people will just copy

19:09.782 --> 19:11.782
The ability to be able to cash
out in bitcoin?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.518
[dave] it's actually not that
easy to deal with bitcoin.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.854
And one of the great things we
have at coinmiles is we convert

19:16.923 --> 19:19.123
Your bitcoin in less than 24
hours.

19:19.192 --> 19:23.327
So if you wait to cash out using
a traditional cash back,

19:23.395 --> 19:24.262
Bitcoin is a wild ride.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.262
Totally!

19:25.331 --> 19:26.531
[dave] it goes up and down all
the time.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.300
Typically, you wanna get your
purchases converted in bitcoin

19:29.368 --> 19:30.701
As soon as possible.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.469
We're the only company that do
that right now on the market

19:32.538 --> 19:33.637
That I'm aware of.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.674
We acquired right now around 200
users daily on the app.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.510
We now have one transaction
every ten minutes.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.079

card-linked offers.

with the highest rate

19:44.316 --> 19:46.784

world, around 87%.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.855

tax lawyer on this one?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.891
[dave] I'm a financial
litigation lawyer,

19:53.893 --> 19:56.294
And that's what I was doing
before launching this company.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.896

20:08.841 --> 20:11.141
Worked for seven years as a
police officer.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.376
Became a lawyer.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.580

opportunity to build something,

20:15.648 --> 20:16.480
And I took it.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.915
What do you need the money for?

20:17.917 --> 20:21.752
In-store brands, we need boots
on the ground, we need sales guy

20:21.820 --> 20:25.790
To approach those brands, so we
wanna hire more salesmen

20:25.858 --> 20:26.924

20:26.992 --> 20:29.526
So if I bring you a sales force

How much of the $200,000
do you still need?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.163

26:59.752 --> 27:02.219
-[vincenzo] okay, so--
-[wes] the chassis isn't.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.888
[vid] the chassis is supplied by
another manufacturer.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.056
[vincenzo] right.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.993
So, how have you avoided the
rust issue?

27:09.061 --> 27:12.195
So, in ten years from now, if
the chassis was corroded,

27:12.264 --> 27:14.531
And it was,
it served its lifespan...

27:14.599 --> 27:15.665
[vincenzo] right.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.701
...You could easily remove the
body off the back...

27:17.769 --> 27:18.602
[vincenzo] right.

27:18.670 --> 27:19.302
[vid]..And do what's called a
remount.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.270
[arlene] yeah.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.605
[vid] you would remount it onto
a new chassis.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.140
[arlene] that's interesting.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.975
So do you build them from
scratch or do you retrofit?

27:25.711 --> 27:28.779
Like, I have a fleet of delivery
trucks and sales vehicles,

27:28.847 --> 27:31.315
For example.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.850
Could I bring my fleets to you
to add this on?

27:34.686 --> 27:36.186
No, we would build you a
brand-new body.

27:36.254 --> 27:37.788
Okay.

27:37.856 --> 27:41.725
So we started off--our first
real year of selling was 2013.

27:41.793 --> 27:44.528
We did just under a mil.

27:44.596 --> 27:49.032
Since then, we finished off 2020
at about $1.6 million.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.801
[manjit] and what was your
profit on that?

27:50.869 --> 27:52.136
10% net.

27:52.138 --> 27:55.972
After all expenses, after I paid
myself, after we paid the rent,

27:55.975 --> 27:56.973
We netted 10%.

27:57.042 --> 27:57.941
That's decent.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.376
[michele] what does a regular
fire truck cost

27:59.445 --> 28:00.377
And what do yours cost?

28:00.445 --> 28:01.978
[vid] so a regular fire truck
like this...

28:01.981 --> 28:04.281
-[michele] yeah.
-[vid]...Would cost $250,000.

28:04.283 --> 28:07.818
-Mine is $150,000.
-So $250,000 versus $150,000.

28:07.886 --> 28:09.019
[vid] correct.

28:09.087 --> 28:12.022
[michele] so why haven't you
sold hundreds of these then?

28:12.090 --> 28:13.190
It's tough.

28:13.258 --> 28:15.926
Because every year, you know,
every month, every week,

28:15.994 --> 28:18.528
I'm bidding on
municipal contracts.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.065
The problem now is not winning
those contracts,

28:21.133 --> 28:23.533
Because I am winning those
contracts,

28:23.536 --> 28:25.536
It's delivering the finished
product to those clients.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.772
What's your backlog, if any?

28:28.840 --> 28:30.340
I have 12 in backlog right now.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.242
What is the bottleneck here?

28:32.310 --> 28:34.678
Is it sales, is it getting the
trucks, is it the industry?

28:34.680 --> 28:38.015
Like, there's more questions
than there are answers

28:38.083 --> 28:38.916
Right now, vid.

28:38.984 --> 28:40.117
Understood.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.818
So, manjit, as a sole person,
you know,

28:41.821 --> 28:44.020
I'm limited on what I can do.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.690
If I started selling 20 trucks a
month, I wouldn't be able

28:46.759 --> 28:47.624
To do it.

28:47.692 --> 28:48.959
I wouldn't be able to build
them,

28:49.027 --> 28:49.960
I wouldn't be able
to deliver them.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.428
So it's just a manpower issue,
labour issue?

28:51.496 --> 28:52.629
It's a labour issue,
it's a manpower,

28:52.697 --> 28:54.664
It's a back-office issue.

28:54.667 --> 28:55.866
-It's everything.
-[vid] it's everything.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.234
Yeah.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.269
You know, I'm struggling with
the back office

28:59.337 --> 29:01.004
Because I'm doing it by myself.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.973
You know, I don't have an
accounting staff;

29:02.975 --> 29:06.343
I don't have an it staff;
I don't have a marketing staff;

29:06.411 --> 29:07.644
I don't have a sales staff.

29:07.646 --> 29:10.280
If I could have help with that,
everything else would flow,

29:10.348 --> 29:11.114
And it would.

29:11.183 --> 29:11.982
It would.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.252
I know, but, vid, why would--I'm
not a human resource place,

29:15.254 --> 29:16.520
So I'm just curious...

29:17.990 --> 29:19.189
[vid] yeah.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.757
...Why are you coming to ask us
for that back office?

29:20.826 --> 29:23.460
That means I'm going into an
operation.

29:23.528 --> 29:24.561
Well--

29:24.630 --> 29:26.997
Hold on, hold on, if I was
running my own business

29:27.065 --> 29:30.400
And I'm doing all the
backend--the finance, paying it,

29:30.402 --> 29:33.403
Collecting and everything--I
wouldn't be sitting on the stage

29:33.472 --> 29:34.271
Right now, okay?

29:34.339 --> 29:35.806
And that's what you're doing,
right?

29:35.874 --> 29:39.810
You can't run a business when
you have nobody behind you doing

29:39.878 --> 29:41.711
All the paperwork and the
backend stuff, okay?

29:41.714 --> 29:42.646
Absolutely.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.748

reasonable.

35:16.681 --> 35:17.914

35:17.982 --> 35:19.415

35:19.418 --> 35:21.384

re-constructors.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.354

free, cruelty free.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.223
-I feel fabulous!
-[laughter]

35:27.226 --> 35:30.227
-This is my beyoncé moment!
-[dragons] wow!

35:30.295 --> 35:33.062
[wes] what a transformation,
woo!

35:33.065 --> 35:35.398
Oh, I'm living my best beyoncé
life, dragons!

35:35.466 --> 35:37.267
[laughter]

35:37.335 --> 35:41.037
So, what's great about our
products is we have our little

35:41.106 --> 35:43.640
Hang hooks and just so easy and
accessible in the shower.

35:45.110 --> 35:49.546
Well, not only that, you can cut
this right open.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.014
You can squeeze every last drop.

35:51.082 --> 35:53.449
[jay] so, dragons, who wants to
join us in saying goodbye to

35:53.452 --> 35:58.655
Bottles, to bad hair days, and
say hello to the fantastic...

35:58.657 --> 36:00.723
-[both] aob products.
-Well done.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.326
All right, dragons, all the fun

36:03.394 --> 36:04.728

36:04.796 --> 36:06.930
-Down to business.
-[jay] down to business.

36:06.932 --> 36:10.333
So right beside you, we have
brought some samples for each

36:10.335 --> 36:12.068
Of you, if you would like to
take a look.

36:12.070 --> 36:16.072
Why am I the only person with a
wig?

36:16.074 --> 36:17.707
[jay] you are the new dragon,
and we really didn't want you

36:17.775 --> 36:19.275

we'd give you a wig

36:19.344 --> 36:21.011
Just to join everybody
else on the panel.

36:21.079 --> 36:21.911
-[michele] it's true.
-[manjit] so kind.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.746
You can have your beyoncé moment

36:23.749 --> 36:26.182

36:30.822 --> 36:32.088
[arlene] it's you!

36:32.156 --> 36:34.691
Okay, I need some--I need the
fan.

36:34.759 --> 36:35.825
I need a fan here.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.293
[manjit] you look good in pink,
wes.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.361
[wes] does that match?

36:38.430 --> 36:40.196
-Does it match the colour?
-[michele] let's see.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.497
-[wes] look at that.
-[arlene] oh.

36:41.500 --> 36:45.268
Oh yeah.

36:45.336 --> 36:47.637

36:47.639 --> 36:50.073

-Okay.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.178
[jay] so, dragons, I'm sure
you've all seen this rubbish

36:55.180 --> 36:57.113
Around the side of your bathtub.

36:57.181 --> 36:59.082
It's an eyesore.

36:59.150 --> 37:00.383
-We wanna get rid of it, so--
-[wes and arlene] whoa.

37:00.451 --> 37:02.318
[manjit] you guys have a flair
for the dramatic.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.988
-Only a little bit.
-[arlene] a tiny bit.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.525
Tell us about, you know,
how you came up with it

37:08.593 --> 37:09.692
And what's your background.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.995
Yeah, so we arrived in canada
ten years ago.

37:12.997 --> 37:16.232
You know, neither of us had any
jobs, and we basically came

37:16.301 --> 37:17.200
With some savings.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.302
And aaron is very ambitious.

37:19.304 --> 37:20.403
He's a hairstylist.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.672
He said, "you know what,
I'd love to own my own salon."

37:22.740 --> 37:23.940
So we opened our own salon.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.676
And then like and he said,
"I've always wanted to own

37:26.678 --> 37:27.744
My own product line.

37:27.812 --> 37:30.246
I've been listening to customers
for over 15 years."

37:30.315 --> 37:32.615
And I was thinking, "this is
crazy, but let's go with it."

37:32.684 --> 37:33.783
-[michele] yeah.
-Very supportive.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.518
[chuckles]

37:36.788 --> 37:37.553
So is this launched in market?

37:37.556 --> 37:38.388
You said it's new.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.455
How new is it?

37:39.524 --> 37:41.224
Yeah, so we have a full year of
sales.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.727
In that year, we've had $215,000
of revenue.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.563
How much do you make them for
and how much do you

37:47.566 --> 37:48.365
Sell them for?

37:48.433 --> 37:51.567
So the pouches retail for $32.

37:51.636 --> 37:54.337
And then our new products go
from $32 and $34.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.842
It costs us $7 to make our
pouches, and then our new

37:58.910 --> 38:01.377
Products range between $8.50 and
$10.05.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.578
[michele] got it.

38:02.647 --> 38:05.982
So around $215,000 in sales,
what's your gross margin?

38:05.984 --> 38:10.753
So to date, we've made a net
profit of $20,000.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.255
-So 10% net.
-[jay] yeah.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.924
So it usually doesn't cost $7 to
$10 bucks to make shampoo

38:14.992 --> 38:15.858
And conditioner.

38:15.927 --> 38:16.826
-That's pretty expensive.
-[jay] I know.

38:16.894 --> 38:17.727
Yeah.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.130
We started off with a small
production,

38:20.198 --> 38:22.399
So that's why the product did
cost so much at the start.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.335
But the ingredients are
extremely good.

38:25.403 --> 38:28.137
But where can you get the cost
to if you get

38:28.206 --> 38:29.739
Large-scale volumes?

38:29.741 --> 38:32.008
Yes, so we really need to blow
this up,

38:32.076 --> 38:33.209
Get a much bigger scale.

38:33.277 --> 38:36.312
[michele] so when this comes
down, it comes to $5 or $1?

38:36.315 --> 38:37.313
Probably $5.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.015
There's really high-end
ingredients in all

38:39.017 --> 38:40.317
Of our products.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.418
But does that mean that you have
to hand-sell each of them?

38:42.421 --> 38:44.254
Like, it has to be clear as to
what the advantage

38:44.322 --> 38:46.222
Of this product is.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.024
[aaron] I do a lot on the
shopping channel.

38:48.026 --> 38:52.662
I do a lot of tv, and I like to
be able to do that performance

38:52.664 --> 38:55.031
For people to get to know me, to
get to know the brand,

38:55.099 --> 38:56.899
And really like--really sell it.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.735
You know, I like to work hard.

38:58.803 --> 39:02.105
[wes] I think for you guys
direct to consumer is it.

39:02.173 --> 39:06.642
And I think you, aaron, is the
guy to do it, to sell it.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.244
-With my beyoncé wig?
-[jay] what about me?

39:08.312 --> 39:10.246
[arlene] I think drtv is it for
him, not d to c.

39:10.314 --> 39:13.216
[wes] yeah, well--yeah, you
know, that--

39:13.284 --> 39:14.984
Do you do any direct to
consumer?

39:15.052 --> 39:16.519
Are you selling online from your
own website?

39:16.521 --> 39:17.754
[jay] yeah, we have an online
platform.

39:17.822 --> 39:20.456
Our online sales in the first
year were 55% online,

39:20.525 --> 39:23.159
45% was like wholesale
and distribution.

39:23.227 --> 39:26.129
Our advertising costs have been
super low--

39:26.197 --> 39:27.029
You don't have to spend money on
advertising.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.131
-You guys are the ad.
-[jay] right.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.200
So just--can I just step back to
my question?

39:30.268 --> 39:32.535
Because I think it's an
important point,

39:32.537 --> 39:34.204
And I wanna see where
you guys are at.

39:35.339 --> 39:36.305
-[aaron] yeah, of course.
-[jay] right.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.040
So direct response tv, drtv,
right...

39:38.109 --> 39:38.908
[aaron] yeah.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.311
...Is actually a really good
strategy to sell a lot.

39:42.748 --> 39:46.015
Like, you can sell tens of
millions of dollars that way.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.083
-Qvc, the shopping channel...
-Yes.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.317
[arlene]...Shopping network.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.287
Are you open to forgetting all
the other channels

39:51.355 --> 39:52.488

to that channel?

39:52.557 --> 39:55.391

passionate you are about salons,

39:59.564 --> 40:01.597
And now you're saying you're
willing to pull out of salons?

40:01.600 --> 40:02.966
That's very contradictory.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.100
No, not necessarily pull out of
salons,

40:04.102 --> 40:05.568

Because ultimately, like, you
