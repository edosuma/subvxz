Ooh!
[ Music stops ]

10:07.207 --> 10:09.908
Music Hole: You know what?
I envy you.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.444
I've always wanted
to be heard by everyone.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.947
That's what friends are, right,
just people to observe you,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.582
people
to enjoy your song?

10:17.584 --> 10:18.750
Hey, bud.

10:18.752 --> 10:22.120
Yeah.
I'm lucky.

10:22.122 --> 10:26.324
Jake, I've selected the winner
of The Battle of the Bands.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.026
[ Clears throat ]

10:28.794 --> 10:30.762
The winner is
a very special someone

10:30.764 --> 10:32.964
who I just met,
last name -- Hole.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.834
She'll take home this handmade
potato-chip-bag crown.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.636
Music Hole:
Oh, my gosh!

10:37.638 --> 10:39.804
I've never won
an award before.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.742
Both:  With the sorrow
in our hearts

10:43.744 --> 10:46.978
We can play

10:46.980 --> 10:52.784
And I look up to you

10:52.786 --> 10:59.991
And we hear different sounds
than the heartless do

10:59.993 --> 11:07.699
Wakeful at night looking
everywhere for you

11:07.701 --> 11:14.172
Why do I look up to you?

11:18.978 --> 11:22.947
Come along with me

11:22.949 --> 11:27.018
And the butterflies and bees
