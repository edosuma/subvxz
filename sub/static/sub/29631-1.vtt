WEBVTT

00:07.141 --> 00:08.941
Tim: <i> I'm running</i>
<i> for San Bernardino</i>

00:08.943 --> 00:10.809
<i> District Attorney.</i>

00:11.479 --> 00:12.878
Yeah.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.313
I'm coming out here.

00:14.315 --> 00:17.249
I'm a one-man band,
meeting the businesses,

00:17.251 --> 00:18.350
<i> talking to voters,</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:21.020
<i> and getting the word out</i>
<i> about my candidacy.</i>

00:21.856 --> 00:25.424
Yes, for District Attorney.
I've said that three times now.

00:25.826 --> 00:30.129
I'm not that corrupt,
Washington-style,

00:30.131 --> 00:34.700
swamp-style...
District Attorney.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.174
Look, I'm strong on crime.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.544
I'm strong on crime.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.548
I'm him! I don't have a beard.
I...

00:49.550 --> 00:50.883
He doesn't have a beard in this.

00:50.885 --> 00:55.487
This is me. Yeah. I am me.
I am... I just have a beard.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.956
And I have sunglasses on. See?

00:57.958 --> 00:59.591
That's a documentary crew
filming.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.428
They're making a film
about my campaign.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.762
See me?

01:03.898 --> 01:04.863
That's me. Okay?

01:04.864 --> 01:07.599
I just have a beard now
because we did a focus group

01:07.601 --> 01:08.967
and people liked the beard.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.403
Toni Newman says
the beard works.

01:12.807 --> 01:15.074
Well, Vincent Rosetti

01:15.076 --> 01:17.209
and some other clown, Sandoval.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.778
So, I'm third party.
Just look for Tim Heidecker.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.280
If you have the Internet,
you can go

01:21.282 --> 01:24.883
to timheideckerforda.com.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.052
And I'm gonna bring change.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.121
All right?

01:58.219 --> 02:01.186
All the... all the chips
are in on this,

02:01.188 --> 02:02.721
sort of all the...

02:02.723 --> 02:06.692
Everything's, um,
on the line here.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.259
<i> And, you know, financially,</i>

02:08.262 --> 02:12.131
<i> emotionally, sort of,</i>
<i> where I'm at...</i>

02:12.133 --> 02:13.532
<i> this is sort of my...</i>

02:13.534 --> 02:16.435
<i> I don't wanna say my last play,</i>
<i> but it's my big play.</i>

02:16.437 --> 02:18.837
<i> I think we've put ourselves</i>
<i> in a perfect position</i>

02:18.839 --> 02:21.206
<i> to really come from</i>
<i> out of nowhere,</i>

02:21.208 --> 02:22.241
<i> be the outsider,</i>

02:22.243 --> 02:23.942
<i> and I think we have</i>
<i> a very good chance</i>

02:23.944 --> 02:25.010
<i> of winning, too.</i>

02:25.012 --> 02:26.945
Tim: Oh, hi. I love dogs,
so this is perfect.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.614
- Here's a...
- What are you running for?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.149
- District Attorney.
- (dog barking)

02:30.151 --> 02:33.185
Yeah, running against
Vincent Rosetti.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.319
This is not a vote for me.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.787
It's just to let me
get on the ballot.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.656
I'm running
as an independent candidate.

02:37.658 --> 02:42.728
<i> Get on the ballot is a big part</i>
<i> of my day, every day.</i>

02:42.730 --> 02:46.165
At 15 signatures today,
so feeling pretty good.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.001
<i> We're just basically taking it</i>
<i> street by street,</i>

02:49.003 --> 02:51.069
<i> and it's been a slog.</i>

02:51.071 --> 02:55.174
This is basically...
Fontana has been somewhere

02:55.176 --> 02:59.011
where I've pretty much covered
the past three or four days.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.146
<i> I'm on my own.</i>
<i> I'm a one-man band.</i>

03:01.148 --> 03:02.281
<i> I've got Rialto to hit.</i>

03:02.283 --> 03:05.317
<i> I've got Highland, Redlands,</i>
<i> Loma Linda,</i>

03:05.319 --> 03:06.552
<i> the city of San Bernardino,</i>

03:06.554 --> 03:08.687
<i> and we have to cover</i>
<i> all that area.</i>

03:08.689 --> 03:11.190
It's 108 degrees out.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.258
Ugh.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.826
<i> You know, it's a lot of ground</i>
<i> to cover</i>

03:14.828 --> 03:16.728
<i> 'cause, first of all,</i>
<i> most people aren't home.</i>

03:16.730 --> 03:20.265
<i> Knocking on their door</i>
<i> on a Wednesday at 1:00 p.m...</i>

03:20.267 --> 03:23.435
(clears throat)<i> You know,</i>
<i> I'm just... It's tough.</i>

03:23.437 --> 03:26.705
<i> We need, you know,</i>
<i> something like 500 signatures</i>

03:26.707 --> 03:28.574
<i> by next week.</i>

03:29.410 --> 03:30.709
<i> But we're on track.</i>

03:30.711 --> 03:33.378
We're very optimistic about it,
and that's...

03:33.380 --> 03:34.646
Toni's cracking the whip on that

03:34.648 --> 03:36.114
'cause if we're not on
the ballot,

03:36.116 --> 03:39.985
then we're in real trouble.
You guys voters? You 18?

03:40.955 --> 03:42.421
Do you vote? No?

03:42.423 --> 03:44.957
I'm running
for District Attorney.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.060
No, I'm running
for District Attorney.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.127
Sort of like governor.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.430
It's the way to change
your future.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.499
All right, thank you. Be safe.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.068
We have tremendous, you know,

03:56.070 --> 03:58.136
support on the Internet
for the campaign,

03:58.138 --> 04:02.107
and we have
a real movement happening.

04:02.109 --> 04:06.411
Timheideckerforda.com.
It's a website.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.479
And you can go on there

04:07.481 --> 04:09.615
and fill out our petition
to get me on the ballot.

04:09.617 --> 04:13.018
We need 500 signatures.
And I'm strong...

04:13.020 --> 04:17.456
strong on crime, no uh...

04:17.891 --> 04:18.790
no uh...

04:18.791 --> 04:22.594
no more corruption, you know,
just getting Rosetti out.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.496
So, pass that on to your dad,
all right?

04:24.498 --> 04:26.498
My campaign chairman,
Toni Newman,

04:26.500 --> 04:31.336
is very active in the campaign
and is doing...

04:31.338 --> 04:34.873
Wearing many hats,
talking to media outlets

04:34.875 --> 04:35.874
almost every day.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.878
We got the Epson printer
basically printing out

04:40.114 --> 04:41.980
whatever we need...

04:42.883 --> 04:44.416
and then
for the bigger-print stuff,

04:44.418 --> 04:50.455
we're going off, you know, to...
to Kinko's for that stuff.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.724
This is our campaign
headquarters, really,

04:52.726 --> 04:54.826
at this point,
until we get bigger offices.

04:54.828 --> 04:58.497
To-do board, my strategy board,
I call it, my map.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.898
You know, the hotel
treats us right.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.001
We got a fridge
pretty much fully stocked,

05:03.003 --> 05:04.469
whatever you need.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.307
Uh, TV. It's basically
your classic...

05:08.776 --> 05:09.975
bathroom, which is all I need.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.345
That's work,
and then we have, sort of...

05:13.347 --> 05:16.481
I don't want to say play,
but rest

05:16.483 --> 05:18.517
and sort of a home life,

05:18.519 --> 05:21.687
which was
one of the great reasons

05:21.789 --> 05:23.422
I picked up on this idea

05:23.424 --> 05:26.992
of relocating
to this beautiful hotel,

05:26.994 --> 05:28.126
<i> is that I could...</i>

05:28.128 --> 05:29.861
<i> I don't have to commute</i>
<i> or anything like that.</i>

05:29.863 --> 05:32.264
<i> I can basically get right</i>
<i> to work as soon as I get up.</i>

05:32.266 --> 05:34.399
<i> And then I'm just</i>
<i> in the community,</i>

05:34.401 --> 05:36.368
<i> which is great.</i>
<i> It's not necessarily</i>

05:36.370 --> 05:37.569
<i> about having... I don't need</i>

05:37.571 --> 05:39.504
to have lived here
my entire life

05:39.506 --> 05:41.173
to know the problems
and to understand

05:41.175 --> 05:43.175
how to fix them.
There's crime everywhere,

05:43.177 --> 05:46.712
and the same solution
applies to anywhere you live.

05:46.714 --> 05:51.049
So, if I lived here,
which I do officially...

05:51.051 --> 05:52.250
This is my legal residence.

05:52.252 --> 05:56.154
This is where mail comes to,
when I need mail.

05:57.725 --> 06:01.460
It's the same anywhere. And...

06:01.528 --> 06:03.729
You know, if I need
to do a call in here,

06:03.731 --> 06:04.796
I got a phone in here.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.465
<i> You know, I wish</i>
<i> I had the volunteers,</i>

06:06.467 --> 06:09.768
<i> but I also am glad and grateful</i>
<i> that there are...</i>

06:09.770 --> 06:11.536
<i> that it's me</i>
<i> coming to the door.</i>

06:11.538 --> 06:13.538
I'm not a career politician.
I'm an outsider.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.574
Are you an attorney...
You're an attorney now?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.975
I've practiced law, yeah,

06:16.977 --> 06:19.578
- and I've represented myself.
- Okay.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.246
I've had tremendous experience
in law,

06:21.248 --> 06:23.281
- so there's no worries there.
- All right.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.816
<i> 'Cause that's what's happening</i>
<i> with Rosetti,</i>

06:24.818 --> 06:26.685
<i> is he's hiring</i>
<i> all these people, immigrants,</i>

06:26.687 --> 06:29.888
people that probably
don't even have identification.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.858
<i> Rosetti is paying them cash</i>
<i> to go out there</i>

06:32.860 --> 06:34.860
<i> and basically offer cash</i>

06:34.862 --> 06:37.329
if you vote for Rosetti
if I guaran...

06:37.331 --> 06:38.530
So, they're buying votes.

06:38.532 --> 06:44.302
My options were, really,
meet him again in civil court...

06:44.304 --> 06:48.540
to prosecute him for the crime
he committed against me,

06:48.542 --> 06:50.776
<i> which is</i>
<i> unlawful incrimination.</i>

06:50.778 --> 06:52.611
I'd rather have you guys
in the driver's seat

06:52.613 --> 06:54.980
than these rats here.
And they're liars.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.481
And I don't know
what I did to them.

06:56.483 --> 07:01.420
I don't know what I did to them
that they're so upset with me.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.655
man: <i> Tragedy struck today</i>
<i> as hundreds</i>

07:03.657 --> 07:05.724
<i> of musical-festival attendees</i>
<i> fell ill</i>

07:05.726 --> 07:09.428
<i> in what authorities are calling</i>
<i> a suspected drug overdose.</i>

07:09.430 --> 07:11.630
<i> The San Bernardino County</i>
<i> Sheriff's Office</i>

07:11.632 --> 07:13.932
<i> has launched an investigation</i>
<i> into the event</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:17.235
<i> known as the Electric Sun</i>
<i> Desert Music Festival,</i>

07:17.237 --> 07:20.705
<i>founded this year by musician</i>
<i>and entrepreneur Tim Heidecker.</i>

07:20.707 --> 07:23.241
The court calls the People
of the State of California

07:23.243 --> 07:25.744
versus
Timothy Richard Heidecker.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.379
Defendant is charged with counts

07:27.381 --> 07:30.081
one through 20
of second-degree felony murder.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.852
Vincent: He filled the lungs
of his innocent victims

07:33.854 --> 07:39.257
with a chemical cocktail.
These portable vaporizers...

07:39.927 --> 07:42.928
contain a dangerous chemical...

07:43.096 --> 07:47.532
known to Mr. Heidecker
to cause illness

07:47.534 --> 07:50.001
and be potentially fatal
when inhaled.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.138
And Mr. Heidecker,
he'll be representing himself

07:53.140 --> 07:55.841
- in this matter.
- I'm being unjustly prosecuted

07:55.843 --> 07:57.876
for crimes of which
I did not commit.

07:57.878 --> 08:01.513
woman: Your daughter was 17
when she left you.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.816
I would do anything
to have her back.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.252
And that man over there
is responsible.

08:07.254 --> 08:10.155
He is responsible
for me losing her.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.090
No, but he disobeyed me!
It's my...

08:12.092 --> 08:15.060
I'll fuck you up, Mark!
Believe me! I'll fuck you up!

08:15.062 --> 08:20.098
I have never seen
such a heinous crime

08:20.100 --> 08:23.802
and such a tragedy.
See that justice is done.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.737
Convict this individual.

08:25.739 --> 08:29.875
Madam Foreperson, has the jury
reached a verdict?

08:29.877 --> 08:33.144
No, we were not able to reach
a unanimous decision.

08:33.145 --> 08:36.548
This is a mistrial,
and we are adjourned.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.150
Yes! Yes!

08:39.152 --> 08:42.988
I thank God for the one juror,
really,

08:42.990 --> 08:44.990
who is sort of the stopgap here

08:44.992 --> 08:48.093
and created this
amazing verdict.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.262
It is my first time being
a juror...

08:50.264 --> 08:52.764
a lawyer and I've proven myself

08:52.766 --> 08:55.901
to be basically unstoppable
at this point.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.136
As far as the DA goes,
this Rosetti

08:58.138 --> 09:02.140
has turned out to be a total rat
and a bad, bad guy.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.276
And I don't know how
you find these people,

09:04.278 --> 09:05.410
if you elect them or not,

09:05.412 --> 09:07.012
but if you have elected them,
who knows?

09:07.014 --> 09:09.180
maybe he'll have
some competition next time.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.050
Fuck this! I'm done!
You hear me!

09:12.052 --> 09:15.220
And I'm coming for you, Rosetti,
wherever the fuck you are!

09:15.222 --> 09:17.255
I'm running
for District Attorney

09:17.257 --> 09:21.293
of San Bernardino County.
Why? Because I'm a fighter,

09:21.295 --> 09:23.528
and I know
what that county needs.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.563
I already proved myself

09:24.565 --> 09:26.431
that I am the best lawyer
there's ever...

09:26.433 --> 09:27.799
I won that case fair and square.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.269
I want to be your DA,
and I hope I have your vote.

09:35.309 --> 09:39.544
Edward: <i> I retired</i>
<i> about three months ago.</i>

09:39.546 --> 09:41.746
<i> I had a backlog</i>
<i> that I really felt</i>

09:41.748 --> 09:42.881
<i>I was obligated to work through</i>

09:42.883 --> 09:47.452
<i> and not pass off</i>
<i> onto any of my fellow judges.</i>

09:47.521 --> 09:49.087
<i> But I have been winding down</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:52.657
since not too long after
the Heidecker verdict.

09:52.659 --> 09:55.160
I have to say that
in all my time on the bench,

09:55.162 --> 09:56.494
I've never had a case like that.

09:56.496 --> 10:00.231
<i> Mr. Heidecker clearly had</i>
<i> no respect for decorum.</i>

10:00.233 --> 10:02.300
Objection. Defendant
is intimidating this witness.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.636
I am not intimidate...
I'll intimidate you.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.705
- Believe me.
- Edward: Mr. Heidecker!

10:06.707 --> 10:07.839
- I'm...
- Mr. Heidecker!

10:07.841 --> 10:09.307
I'm warning you
that this is my...

10:09.309 --> 10:11.009
I move to hold the defendant
in contempt.

10:11.011 --> 10:14.512
- Judge, I promise
I'm going somewhere with this.
- Do you have a question to ask,

10:14.514 --> 10:16.781
as opposed to an accusation
to make?

10:16.783 --> 10:19.451
Frankly, he turned it
into a circus.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.320
And I think we all bear
a responsibility

10:22.322 --> 10:23.888
for allowing that to happen.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.890
What a lot of people
don't understand

10:25.892 --> 10:29.194
is that I had to allow
some of that to happen.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.663
<i>I had a constitutional duty...</i>

10:31.665 --> 10:34.933
<i> to allow Mr. Heidecker</i>
<i> to represent himself</i>

10:34.935 --> 10:39.270
and to let him
do the best he could.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.840
So, I think a lot
of the criticism

10:41.842 --> 10:45.176
that's been leveled against me
is simply ignorant.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.277
<i> People don't understand</i>

10:46.279 --> 10:48.246
<i> that that's a very</i>
<i> different situation.</i>

10:48.248 --> 10:50.815
From the volume of hate mail
I received

10:50.817 --> 10:54.419
from people who were irate
about that verdict,

10:54.488 --> 10:56.788
my perception is that...

10:56.790 --> 10:59.357
in large sections
of San Bernardino County,

10:59.359 --> 11:02.293
Mr. Heidecker
is persona non grata.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.497
He is perceived as a charlatan.

11:05.499 --> 11:09.868
He's perceived as a murderer

11:09.870 --> 11:11.870
who got away with it...

11:12.005 --> 11:13.438
um...

11:13.440 --> 11:15.807
by manipulating the system.

11:15.809 --> 11:19.444
Yes, one juror held out,
but as far as the election goes,

11:19.446 --> 11:21.346
I take great comfort
from the fact

11:21.348 --> 11:23.581
that 11 out of 12...

11:23.583 --> 11:26.718
were convinced
beyond a reasonable doubt...

11:26.720 --> 11:30.789
that he was guilty of at least
second-degree felony murder.

11:30.791 --> 11:35.093
So, if 11 out of 12 eligible
voters in San Bernardino County

11:35.095 --> 11:36.528
believe that...

11:37.197 --> 11:39.064
he doesn't have a chance.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.031
Josh:

11:40.033 --> 11:42.867
Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes.

11:43.770 --> 11:44.502
Josh:

11:44.504 --> 11:48.306
Well, you know, this is, uh...

11:48.308 --> 11:51.476
this is the most serious race
I've run in.

11:51.478 --> 11:56.514
You don't want guys that have
sort of career politicians.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.283
I think that's my point,
is you don't want...

11:58.285 --> 12:00.151
you want an outsider to come in
and shake things up

12:00.153 --> 12:03.354
because San Bernardino
has gotten to be so corrupt.

12:03.356 --> 12:07.792
And the crime has skyrocketed.
We have crime stats here.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.227
All these numbers,
if you see the...

12:09.229 --> 12:11.529
You can almost look
from a 30,000-foot view,

12:11.531 --> 12:15.467
you see that it's just up, up,
up, and that's all crime.

12:15.469 --> 12:19.304
You know, really a lot
of big problems here, which...

12:19.306 --> 12:20.338
We want to be realistic,

12:20.340 --> 12:24.576
but I'd say a 100 percent
elimination of crime...

12:24.578 --> 12:28.413
is our goal. And that's,
I think, very doable.

12:29.316 --> 12:33.218
We are off to one of my
favorite family restaurants

12:33.220 --> 12:35.353
in the San Bernardino County.

12:35.355 --> 12:39.224
And we're gonna be meeting
with my campaign chairman,

12:39.226 --> 12:41.526
Toni Newman.
Really a brilliant strategist,

12:41.528 --> 12:46.164
a brilliant political mind
who knows the issues

12:46.166 --> 12:48.933
and believes in me
as a candidate,

12:48.935 --> 12:50.468
and, frankly, I...

12:50.470 --> 12:53.772
you know, sees me going
far, far, far beyond

12:53.774 --> 12:57.041
simply, District Attorney.

12:57.043 --> 13:01.646
You know, national office,
national positions.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.616
So, we'll...

13:04.684 --> 13:07.685
- (watch chimes)
- On my way.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.389
On...

13:11.525 --> 13:13.057
(watch dings)

13:13.860 --> 13:15.260
On...

13:16.363 --> 13:19.330
- (watch dings)
- Okay.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.834
We'll be there in five minutes.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.602
- (bell chimes)
- How you doing?

13:24.604 --> 13:26.404
- Mel: Good. Hi. How are you?
- Tim: Good. How are you?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.872
- I'm Tim Heidecker.
- Tim, nice to meet you.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.707
Yeah.
Running for District Attorney.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.876
How's it going? Nice to see you.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.244
<i> -</i> woman: <i> Hola.</i>
- How you doing?

13:33.246 --> 13:34.946
I'm Tim Heidecker.
Nice to meet you.

13:34.948 --> 13:38.049
Running for District Attorney.
Y'all registered voters, I hope?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.751
I'm not wasting my time
over here?

13:39.753 --> 13:41.419
- man: Absolutely.
- Great.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.453
Sorry I'm late.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.722
- Well...
- This is Toni Newman,

13:44.724 --> 13:48.927
my campaign chairm...
chairwoman, chairman, whatever.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.496
I come
from an advertising background,

13:51.498 --> 13:52.564
outside advertising.

13:52.566 --> 13:56.668
I've got about 17, 20 years
in advertising, so...

13:56.803 --> 13:58.036
Tim: Which is ultimately...

13:58.038 --> 14:00.038
You were telling me this,
that a campaign, a candidate,

14:00.040 --> 14:01.206
is essentially a product, is...

14:01.208 --> 14:03.441
Why don't you
bring me up to speed?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.710
Well, you know,
I've just been out canvassing.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.880
I mean, I'm getting signatures
at a rate that concerns me

14:08.882 --> 14:10.782
because it's not the rate
that is gonna get us

14:10.784 --> 14:13.484
to where we need to be,
according to you.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.719
Well, we can't get on the ballot

14:14.721 --> 14:16.487
- if we don't have
enough signatures.
- I understand.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.723
So we need to find a way to...

14:18.725 --> 14:20.925
- We need
to figure out something.
- Well, let's just

14:20.927 --> 14:21.793
put that aside.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.094
Let's put that
on the back burner.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.964
Can we get...
Yeah, we're very hungry.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.866
I have to try
those peanut butter...

14:27.868 --> 14:30.134
that peanut butter
chocolate banana pie.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.836
You know, just sort of
the classic omelet.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.239
- What's the classic omelet?
- waitress: Do you want to do
the four and 20 omelet?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.207
- Yeah, let's do that.
That sounds great.
- waitress: Sure.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.142
What kind of wine
do you have, a red wine?

14:38.144 --> 14:40.778
waitress: Red? We have a Merlot.
We have Cabernet.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.081
- We have Pinot Noir.
- Pinot?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.582
- Thank you so much.
- waitress: Mm-hmm.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.252
Are you registered to vote
in the area?

14:47.254 --> 14:48.853
- waitress: Not in this area.
- Tim: Okay.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.490
'Cause I felt like we had
a connection from the beginning.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.458
Tim: Oh, yeah.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.326
- And I felt like...
- Tim: That was there.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.394
...we should be a team,

14:56.396 --> 15:00.899
that we could put things back
in their proper place.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.101
Tim: Yeah, because you're
from this area,

15:03.103 --> 15:04.335
so you know even more than I do.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.205
- Yes, I'm from San Bernardino.
- And you were talking to me

15:07.207 --> 15:08.873
about the demographics change.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.509
It's not the same city
that I grew up in.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.144
- It's absolutely changed.
- Mm-hmm.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.079
- And it's not safe anymore.
- No.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.849
And you know exactly
what I'm talking about...

15:17.851 --> 15:21.452
- don't you?
- Yeah. Well, I think we all do.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.654
Oh, thank you.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.088
- Tim: That's a big pour.
- Wow.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.724
And you have shown me
just unbelievable graphics that

15:26.726 --> 15:30.662
you've pulled off the Internet,
unbelievable stats that,

15:30.664 --> 15:34.065
when you look
at the Hispanic population,

15:34.067 --> 15:35.800
- Asian population...
- Toni: I mean, you could look

15:35.802 --> 15:37.302
through the newspaper,
and you can...

15:37.304 --> 15:39.737
- Tim: You see it, yeah.
- ...see the crime.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.674
I feel like a minority
in my own city,

15:42.676 --> 15:46.044
- to be quite honest with you.
- That's kind of interesting.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.278
You can't be safe there anymore.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.448
And Rosetti is behind
a lot of this.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.750
It's sort of like this
kind of three-stage thing.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.118
It's, "We have a rat problem."

15:54.120 --> 15:55.620
And I wish you'd give me
a pen that works.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.989
Here, let me give you
another one. "Get him out."

15:57.991 --> 16:00.525
- So, once you get
into office...
- Tim: Well, yeah,

16:00.527 --> 16:01.592
but before that,

16:01.594 --> 16:03.461
acknowledge that we have
a rat problem.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.697
So, we have a rat problem.
That's one.

16:05.699 --> 16:09.467
- Then we set the rat trap.
- Set the trap.

16:10.904 --> 16:13.171
Tim: So, that's... Yeah,
we have a rat problem.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.138
Set the rat trap.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.873
waitress: There we go.
Food coming in.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.809
Tim: But I would like
more specifics.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.444
In terms of setting the trap,

16:19.446 --> 16:21.346
we need to force him
into the corner

16:21.348 --> 16:26.150
to come to the debate,
to come to the town hall debate.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.386
Toni: Yeah, but that's gonna be
difficult to do.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.188
He's not gonna want to interact
with you.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.622
- He's already...
- Well, of course,

16:31.624 --> 16:33.992
because he knows
he would lose the debate,

16:33.994 --> 16:35.193
just like he lost in court.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.895
I love that, sort of,
Rocky Balboa,

16:37.897 --> 16:39.630
you know,
underdog position to be in.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.332
I don't think there's
a better position to be in,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.134
especially when you're fighting
up against the powers

16:43.136 --> 16:44.902
that be of Rosetti
and the machine,

16:44.904 --> 16:46.537
the San Bernardino machine,

16:46.539 --> 16:50.942
which includes people like
Symczyk, who is in that...

16:50.944 --> 16:54.412
is part of that, you know...

16:54.414 --> 16:55.680
He's the other one. He retired.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.950
He got out 'cause he knew
that he ran a kangaroo court.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.818
- Toni: But keep in mind...
- You did hear that, right?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.754
- He retired. He's done.
- Toni: I did hear it.
He's done.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.789
- Tim: He's done.
He got laughed out.
- Toni: He's washed up.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.656
- I know.
- Tim: He got laughed out
of the courtroom.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.393
I heard about it.
We were a team then.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.494
You didn't know it.
You didn't know me.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.762
This is sort of the big reveal.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.196
- I was on the jury...
- Tim: Mm-hmm.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.300
...and thanks to me,
I got him off.

17:16.301 --> 17:21.138
And I got a phone call kind of
out of the blue from Toni.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.141
We met up,
and it was a long lunch,

17:23.143 --> 17:25.175
a lot of gratefulness
coming from me,

17:25.178 --> 17:29.113
a lot of respect for you
and your mind.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.783
I knew that Tim was a guy
that was gonna

17:31.785 --> 17:33.184
- help me...
- Hmm.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.218
...accomplish the change

17:34.220 --> 17:37.021
that I know
that San Bernardino needs.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.523
And I saw the corruption
in Rosetti.

17:38.525 --> 17:41.059
As soon as that man opened
his mouth, I could see it.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.394
The campaign sort of
began then, didn't it?

17:43.396 --> 17:45.063
- Toni: Kind of, yeah.
- I want to know

17:45.065 --> 17:46.264
where the pie is.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.499
Did we forget about the pie?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.735
waitress: Do you want them now
or to go?

17:50.737 --> 17:51.669
Well, no, now.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.104
- Toni: He wants it now.
- I mean, I could eat it

17:53.106 --> 17:55.106
- with the breakfast.
- Okay.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.110
Tim: At some point soon,

17:59.112 --> 18:02.046
we need to kind of address
the elephant in the room

18:02.048 --> 18:04.982
and start getting
some kind of staff going.

18:04.984 --> 18:08.886
I've got some flags out there
and working with people.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.388
- Tim: Yeah.
- It's not easy

18:10.390 --> 18:11.422
to get money, though.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.723
- I mean, we're...
- Toni: I know.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.925
We're less than two weeks out.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.493
Toni: But we don't have
the signatures, Tim.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.727
Once we get the signatures,

18:16.729 --> 18:18.563
I think people will be
more apt to give money

18:18.565 --> 18:20.665
because they know
that you're on the ballot.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.166
Tim: Okay, well,
we're talking in circles

18:22.168 --> 18:24.368
because we need money
to get the volunteers

18:24.370 --> 18:25.536
so we can get the signatures.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.737
But this is what it is, folks.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.906
I mean, this is the grind
of the campaign.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.309
Right now we're operating
on a shoestring budget.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.712
Uh, a lot of it's coming out
of my personal account.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.415
And Toni's contributed some.

18:37.417 --> 18:41.252
We don't want that corrupt,
dark money...

18:41.554 --> 18:43.921
because then I become a puppet
of those people.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.425
We would love the big bucks
through small donations,

18:47.427 --> 18:50.061
is sort of our dream.
Or one big donor.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.763
- waitress: There's the pie.
- Thank you. And I do apologize.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.433
We're just on
a rough schedule today.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.534
Let's get a shot of this.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.403
I mean, this is
San Bernardino right here.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.772
- Toni: <i> Is that awesome?</i>
- Tim: <i> This is how it goes.</i>

19:01.774 --> 19:03.674
You have to create
your own momentum.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.910
You have to create
your own media, really.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.346
- Okay. Hi. This is Tim.
<i> - Yes, I know.</i>

19:08.348 --> 19:11.315
Toni: <i> Tim Heidecker.</i>
<i> I wanted to introduce you.</i>

19:11.317 --> 19:13.651
<i> - Go ahead, Tim.</i>
<i> - Hi, everybody.</i>

19:13.653 --> 19:14.719
<i> This is Tim Heidecker,</i>

19:14.721 --> 19:17.188
<i> running for District Attorney</i>
<i> for San Bernardino.</i>

19:17.190 --> 19:20.158
<i> I'm sitting here at one of</i>
<i> my favorite family restaurants</i>

19:20.160 --> 19:21.459
<i> in San Bernardino County,</i>

19:21.461 --> 19:25.062
<i> about to dig in to their</i>
<i> world-famous chocolate pe...</i>

19:25.064 --> 19:26.531
<i> chocolate</i>
<i> peanut butter apple...</i>

19:26.533 --> 19:29.534
<i> or chocolate peanut butter</i>
<i> banana pie.</i>

19:29.536 --> 19:33.204
<i> Doesn't that look good?</i>
<i> So, let's take a bite.</i>

19:33.806 --> 19:35.206
- Toni: <i> Yum. How is it?</i>
<i> - Mm!</i>

19:35.208 --> 19:38.476
- Toni: <i> Is it amazing?</i>
<i> - I'm gonna come back for this.</i>

19:38.478 --> 19:39.844
<i>This is a great piece of pie.</i>

19:39.846 --> 19:42.013
-<i> I look forward</i>
<i> to meeting with you...</i>
- Toni: <i> What are you gonna</i>

19:42.015 --> 19:44.315
<i> - do for the community...</i>
<i> - Don't interrupt the video.</i>

19:44.317 --> 19:48.119
(indistinct chatter)

19:48.121 --> 19:49.253
<i> I look forwarding to...</i>

19:49.255 --> 19:50.955
<i> I look forward to taking a bite</i>
<i> out of crime</i>

19:50.957 --> 19:53.791
<i> when I become elected</i>
<i> District Attorney...</i>

19:53.793 --> 19:56.494
<i> and we will see you</i>
<i> at the ballot box.</i>

19:56.496 --> 19:58.262
<i> Say no to Rosetti.</i>

19:58.264 --> 19:59.864
<i> We have a rat problem,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen.</i>

19:59.866 --> 20:02.967
<i> I am here to exterminate it,</i>
<i> set the rat trap.</i>

20:02.969 --> 20:06.103
<i> We want him out.</i>
<i> We want Rosetti out.</i>

20:06.639 --> 20:09.106
<i> - Tim... go to timheidecker...</i>
- Perfect.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.708
Put that up on Twitter
and Facebook

20:10.710 --> 20:11.976
- on the site.
- Toni: I will.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.445
How about we open
an Instagram account?

20:14.447 --> 20:16.047
Tim: Well, yeah,
we should have that already.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.149
Toni: GoFundMe, Instagram.
Facebook's up.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.151
- I'll work on the billboards.
- Okay. All right.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.919
- Toni: Okay?
- I think that's good.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.688
- You got this?
- Toni: Yeah?

20:23.690 --> 20:26.257
Get that, and we'll deal
with the details later.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.126
I'll see you back at the...
at the office.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.695
- Bye, Tim. Bye.
- Thank you so much.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.563
- Toni: See you a little later.
- Tim: Okay. See you later.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.632
And look for me,
Tim Heidecker for DA.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.802
Mel? Could be a man
or a female, Mel.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.137
- Mel: All right. See you.
- All right.

20:40.139 --> 20:44.442
(indistinct chatter)

20:47.113 --> 20:49.280
Gregg:

21:09.569 --> 21:11.235
Josh: <i> And if you can</i>
<i> just count to three.</i>

21:11.237 --> 21:15.206
- Three, two, one, action.
- Josh: A few more levels here.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.440
If you could just
state your name

21:16.442 --> 21:18.075
and what you had for breakfast.

21:18.077 --> 21:21.112
Gregg Turkington
from <i> On Cinema at the Cinema</i>

21:21.114 --> 21:26.250
and <i> Decker vs. Dracula</i>
and <i> Ant-Man,</i> and I...

21:26.252 --> 21:28.719
Actually,
this is my breakfast, so...

21:28.721 --> 21:30.321
Josh: So, tell me, Gregg,
how did you come

21:30.323 --> 21:31.389
to meet Tim Heidecker?

21:31.391 --> 21:32.923
How did you first
get involved with him?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.659
Well, first I just wanted
to say you're probably wondering

21:34.661 --> 21:38.629
why I chose this park
as a place to meet.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.398
And it's actually
an interesting story.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.068
This is kind of
a historic movie site.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.337
Have you seen
the <i> Oh, God!</i> movie

21:46.339 --> 21:49.006
with George Burns
and John Denver?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.574
- Josh:
- In that spot,

21:50.576 --> 21:54.178
Tracy throws a basket
from far away

21:54.180 --> 21:56.981
and makes it perfectly,
and that's when Shingo thinks,

21:56.983 --> 21:59.917
"Okay, she must be
affiliated with God,"

21:59.919 --> 22:01.485
'cause she couldn't make
that shot otherwise.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.355
So, that's where this... that's
exactly where this was filmed.

22:04.357 --> 22:07.391
Josh: What's your relationship
with Tim Heidecker?

22:07.393 --> 22:10.695
Well, it started out
just as a guest on the show

22:10.697 --> 22:12.730
<i> On Cinema at the Cinema.</i>

22:12.732 --> 22:15.833
(intro music playing)

22:16.369 --> 22:17.968
Hi, everybody.
My name is Tim Heidecker.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.638
And welcome to the first episode
of my new show,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.239
<i> On Cinema at the Cinema.</i>

22:22.241 --> 22:24.108
Congratulations
on the TV series.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.177
Thanks very much.
This is our first episode,

22:26.179 --> 22:27.745
so we're just sort of
working out the kinks

22:27.747 --> 22:29.280
and having a lot of fun
doing it, as well.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.449
Gregg: <i> But then I was bringing</i>
<i> so much expertise</i>

22:31.451 --> 22:32.750
<i> to the show and stuff that,</i>

22:32.752 --> 22:35.786
<i> after the first episode,</i>
<i> I think he realized,</i>

22:35.788 --> 22:37.655
<i> "Why bring in different guests</i>
<i> each week?</i>

22:37.657 --> 22:39.357
<i> Why not just have</i>
<i> a resident expert?"</i>

22:39.359 --> 22:42.660
<i> And so I ended up taking</i>
<i> a bigger and bigger and bigger</i>

22:42.662 --> 22:44.695
<i> and bigger and bigger role</i>
<i> in that until,</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:47.865
<i> finally, that's why people</i>
<i> were tuning in to the show,</i>

22:47.867 --> 22:50.901
was to get
that kind of movie expertise.

22:51.104 --> 22:54.472
Hey, everybody. Welcome back
to another episode of <i> On Cinema.</i>

22:54.474 --> 22:56.073
I'm your host, Tim Heidecker.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.441
He got in over his head,
you know,

22:57.443 --> 22:59.043
with some of his legal troubles
and things

22:59.045 --> 23:01.212
and also the fact
that he doesn't know anything
about movies.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.548
Prepping for the Electric Sun
Desert Music Festival

23:04.550 --> 23:08.219
coming up in a couple...
this coming week, actually.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.887
The good Dr. San and I

23:09.889 --> 23:13.157
have developed
this very special blend,

23:13.159 --> 23:14.925
TCH vape system.

23:14.927 --> 23:19.397
We're gonna be giving away
as much as we can.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.766
Josh:

23:21.768 --> 23:23.334
- For murder, yeah.
- Josh: For murder.

23:23.336 --> 23:25.403
For murder. There were other
legal troubles before that.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.773
In fact, one thing
that was never filed in court

23:28.775 --> 23:31.242
was that he used my credit card

23:31.244 --> 23:33.711
to fund the second season
of <i> Decker,</i>

23:33.713 --> 23:35.012
which was shot in Hawaii.

23:35.014 --> 23:39.083
And he owes me
just under 10,000 dollars.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.085
Strangely enough,
he doesn't have money

23:41.087 --> 23:42.286
to pay me back, but you see

23:42.288 --> 23:44.255
that he has money
for all these other schemes

23:44.257 --> 23:45.356
that he comes up with.

23:45.358 --> 23:48.359
These, like, protein-powder
type products

23:48.361 --> 23:51.362
<i> or something that are supposed</i>
<i> to eliminate germs.</i>

23:51.364 --> 23:53.330
He's got this awful band
called Dekkar,

23:53.332 --> 23:56.400
<i> and they press up thousands</i>
<i> of these CDs, and they just...</i>

23:56.402 --> 23:58.169
<i> I think they take them</i>
<i> all to the dump...</i>

23:58.171 --> 24:00.805
I don't know,
because nobody wants them.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.206
His ex-wife, Ayaka's family,

24:02.208 --> 24:04.375
they financed this movie theater
which he burned down.

24:04.377 --> 24:08.446
I hope he never sees this film
because if he sees this hat...

24:08.714 --> 24:09.713
he's gonna lose it.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.115
He's gonna get so angry
at you guys

24:11.117 --> 24:14.351
'cause he doesn't allow people
to wear movie hats.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.253
Mark, who's a good friend
of mine,

24:16.255 --> 24:17.988
<i> who's also a movie buff,</i>

24:17.990 --> 24:20.224
<i> lost a lot of oxygen</i>
<i> to the brain,</i>

24:20.226 --> 24:21.358
<i> so he was a vegetable.</i>

24:21.360 --> 24:23.761
<i> And we thought he was dead,</i>
<i> but he wasn't dead.</i>

24:23.763 --> 24:25.629
<i>He's alive, but he's in a coma,</i>

24:25.631 --> 24:28.666
and it's all because Tim
didn't get real scuba equipment.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.268
He thought there were only
three <i> Jaws</i> movies,

24:31.270 --> 24:32.837
and I had to let him know
there were more.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.606
He's on Twitter saying
that there's gonna be

24:35.608 --> 24:36.841
a movie called <i> Whale Man.</i>

24:36.843 --> 24:39.343
<i> And if you were gonna</i>
<i> make a movie about a whale,</i>

24:39.345 --> 24:41.045
you would do a Moby Dick movie,

24:41.047 --> 24:42.580
which is already
a successful franchise.

24:42.582 --> 24:48.619
And he says no vaccines. Well,
then little Tom Cruise Jr. died.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.254
<i> And, you know,</i>

24:50.256 --> 24:51.722
<i> it doesn't faze Tim any,</i>
<i> though.</i>

24:51.724 --> 24:53.390
He's right back
with his latest scheme.

24:53.392 --> 24:57.895
He's running for District
Attorney, which is not...

24:57.897 --> 25:00.498
not gonna really happen
because he's not a lawyer.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.566
He doesn't live
in San Bernardino.

25:02.568 --> 25:08.172
Have you seen a movie from 1976
starring Dean Jones

25:08.174 --> 25:10.608
called <i> The Shaggy DA?</i>

25:10.676 --> 25:11.442
Josh:

25:11.444 --> 25:13.777
You should see this movie.
It's a very funny movie.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.714
The character of Dean Jones...
(clears throat)

25:16.716 --> 25:19.083
...is running for DA, okay?

25:19.085 --> 25:21.752
And he has a secret he wants
to keep from the voters,

25:21.754 --> 25:25.122
and the secret is,
he keeps turning into a dog.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.525
You could almost say Tim's...

25:27.593 --> 25:30.928
his whole campaign
is an unofficial remake

25:30.930 --> 25:31.996
of <i> The Shaggy DA</i>

25:31.998 --> 25:34.265
because he keeps turning into
a dog in front of the voters,

25:34.267 --> 25:37.434
except not a dog, more of,
a murderer or an arsonist

25:37.436 --> 25:40.971
or he's unmasked as somebody
who doesn't know anything
about movies

25:40.973 --> 25:44.108
or he doesn't know anything
about the law or what have you.

25:44.110 --> 25:48.979
<i> The Garbage Pail Kids Movie</i>
from 1987 with Anthony Newley...

25:48.981 --> 25:51.815
- was actually also shot
in this park.
- (cellphone chimes)

25:51.817 --> 25:53.150
Hold on.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.959
All right, I got to get going.
Um...

26:05.831 --> 26:07.264
Actually...

26:07.266 --> 26:10.401
if you guys want to come along
and see something that...

26:10.403 --> 26:12.069
in light of what
we've been talking about,

26:12.071 --> 26:14.104
I think you'd find
very interesting.

26:14.106 --> 26:17.441
My source said
it's just past the mailbox.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.145
Okay. Here we go.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.083
See, these are children's films,

26:26.085 --> 26:28.218
so that's not of any use
to the archives,

26:28.220 --> 26:31.956
but this is a sealed copy
of <i> Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>

26:31.958 --> 26:34.625
which actually won
two Academy Awards,

26:34.627 --> 26:37.461
including Best Picture
and Best Actress.

26:37.463 --> 26:40.197
<i> Bringing Down the House</i> with
Steve Martin and Queen Latifah.

26:40.199 --> 26:45.402
This is a great popcorn classic,
one of the funniest movies ever.

26:47.607 --> 26:49.373
A hundred and five minutes.

26:49.375 --> 26:53.177
This is an audiobook.
It does not belong here.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.244
Onto the next location.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.846
<i> This is the kind of thing</i>
<i> that Tim,</i>

26:55.848 --> 26:57.481
<i> since that's what</i>
<i> your film's about...</i>

26:57.483 --> 26:59.016
this is the kind of thing
he would never do.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.451
He doesn't really care
about movies.

27:00.453 --> 27:01.952
You guys know where
to get in touch with me

27:01.954 --> 27:04.655
if you want to discuss
any of this further,

27:04.657 --> 27:08.158
or come by and just film
at the VFA.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.394
Tim: <i> Call...</i>

27:11.964 --> 27:15.232
- Call Gregg Turkington.
- (watch dings)

27:15.501 --> 27:17.501
- (watch dings)
- Come on!

27:17.670 --> 27:19.103
It's Tim Heidecker.
I just got word

27:19.105 --> 27:22.339
that a filmmaker that's been
following me around, Josh.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.941
Has... you contacted him
and you've been

27:23.943 --> 27:26.777
speaking with him?
Is that right?

27:27.279 --> 27:29.880
Gregg:

27:29.882 --> 27:33.651
Hey, Gregg, stay the fuck
out of my movie, okay?

27:33.653 --> 27:34.952
Nobody wants
to hear from you.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.154
This is about
my political career.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.355
This has nothing to do with you.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.290
It has nothing to do
with your fucking movies.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.091
Gregg:

27:41.093 --> 27:42.593
Well, what are you
talking to him about?

27:42.595 --> 27:45.496
What the hell does he
have to do with you?

27:45.498 --> 27:49.600
Gregg:

27:49.602 --> 27:52.436
Well, stay the fuck
away from Josh.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.906
Stay away from his fucking crew,
stay away from me,

27:55.908 --> 27:57.574
and you stay... get...

27:57.576 --> 27:59.043
Gregg:

27:59.045 --> 28:00.744
They are not... No.
That is not...

28:00.746 --> 28:02.980
You're lying to me.
That's not what Josh said.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.982
He said that you wanted
to talk to him about...

28:04.984 --> 28:07.685
- You... you...
- Gregg:

28:08.287 --> 28:09.386
Gregg:

28:09.388 --> 28:10.921
No. Stay out of my life.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.824
- Good luck with the... good...
- Gregg:

28:15.194 --> 28:17.094
All right. Goodbye.
You got nothing to say.

28:17.096 --> 28:20.998
You're a loser. Fuck you.
Stay out of my life.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.171
(clears throat)

28:31.177 --> 28:34.078
Tim: Oh, yeah. That's great.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.182
Look at this.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.050
I wanted it to say, "Houston,
we have a rat problem,"

28:40.052 --> 28:43.287
but we didn't... felt that was
a little confusing.

28:43.289 --> 28:47.357
It's sort of from that,
<i> Ocean's...</i>

28:47.359 --> 28:48.492
<i> Ocean's...</i> What is it?

28:48.494 --> 28:51.729
<i> Apollo 13,</i>
"Houston, we have a problem."

28:51.731 --> 28:54.531
This is, "Houston,
we have a rat problem,"

28:54.533 --> 28:55.966
or just,
"We have a rat problem."

28:55.968 --> 29:00.204
Five thousand of these and then
a little more literature here.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.773
"Vincent Rosetti tried"...

29:02.775 --> 29:06.376
"Vincent Rosetti tried to put
an innocent man in prison.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.112
Now he wants to get re-elected?"

29:08.114 --> 29:10.748
And then it's Roset...
Me, as you can see,

29:10.750 --> 29:14.418
as the exterminator,
Rosetti the Rat.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.421
That's him.
We're about to bring change.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.690
I've talked to you guys
about that.

29:19.692 --> 29:21.892
(grunts) Let's do it.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.928
And my keys are in my room.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.830
Okay, we'll be back soon.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.632
Shit.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.636
All right, let's do the work
we need to do.

29:34.573 --> 29:38.675
- Excuse me.
Can we put this in your window?
- woman: Yeah?

29:39.111 --> 29:39.943
Yeah, go ahead.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.079
Great. Should have brought tape.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.213
Do you have any masking tape

29:43.215 --> 29:44.948
or Scotch tape
or anything like that?

29:44.950 --> 29:48.318
- man:
Right by the cash register.
- Oh, perfect.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.656
That looks pretty good, huh?

29:58.063 --> 29:59.196
Hi, there.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.631
I'm running
for District Attorney.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.066
My name is Tim Heidecker.
My name is Tim Heidecker.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.535
I'm running
for District Attorney.

30:04.537 --> 30:06.103
I'm running
for District Attorney

30:06.105 --> 30:07.371
of San Bernardino County.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.540
Would it be okay
to put these up in your window,

30:09.542 --> 30:10.941
- just one of them? Thank you.
- Sure.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.576
Just wanted to see
if you would be okay with me

30:12.578 --> 30:14.978
putting some of my literature
in your window?

30:14.980 --> 30:17.447
- Okay.
-<i> The message is resonating.</i>

30:17.449 --> 30:22.553
<i> I love the sort of viral,</i>
<i> unorthodox message of,</i>

30:22.555 --> 30:25.189
<i> "We have a rat problem,"</i>
<i> because it gets people talking.</i>

30:25.191 --> 30:29.026
And I think it's...
it's a powerful message.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.061
Once you get down to what
the message is,

30:31.063 --> 30:33.997
<i> you feel the trickle</i>
<i> of the message</i>

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
<i>spreading across this county,</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:37.935
<i> and that's what's gonna</i>
<i> get us the big win.</i>

30:37.937 --> 30:39.469
- woman: No sign now.
- Tim: I understand.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.172
- I apologize.
- woman: Right. Thank you.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.010
Tim: (sighs) Well,
that's a new one.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.447
If there was a real rat problem
in that restaurant,

30:50.449 --> 30:51.682
then it would be appropriate.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.050
And if there isn't
a rat problem,

30:53.052 --> 30:55.252
then they don't have
anything to worry about.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.488
There we go.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.357
Oh, great.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.859
Shit.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.497
Tim: <i> So, what are we doing</i>
<i> with the...</i>

31:07.499 --> 31:09.933
<i> I mean, are we...</i>
<i> Do we have anybody coming down?</i>

31:09.935 --> 31:12.736
- I'm working on it. Actually...
- Tim: Okay.

31:12.738 --> 31:13.904
You said you were working on it.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.240
I'm working on it.
CNN... We've got CNN.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.941
- Tim: You have CNN?
- I have them on the line.

31:17.943 --> 31:20.143
- Tim: You have them
on the line?
- It looks good. It looks good.

31:20.145 --> 31:23.046
Good. What's happening
with the GoPro account?

31:23.048 --> 31:24.948
What's GoPro?
Oh, you mean GoFundMe.

31:24.950 --> 31:26.216
- Tim: Mm-hmm.
- It's GoFundMe.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.517
I got it set up.

31:27.519 --> 31:30.254
We have a few dollars.
People donated already.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.222
Tim: Was it linked
to the website?

31:32.224 --> 31:33.290
No, it's not linked.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.691
I don't think we're able
to do that.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.060
The donations are based...
Most of the time, GoFundMe

31:37.062 --> 31:40.430
is set up for people who are,
like, sick or poor or starving.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.865
- (telephone ringing)
- Hold on a sec.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.333
Toni:
I really shouldn't technically

31:43.335 --> 31:45.869
- be doing this, but...
- All right, hold on. Hello?

31:46.038 --> 31:47.938
Yes. Hi.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.373
Oh, good. Great. Thanks.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.942
- Okay. I'll be right down.
- Toni: Wait, wait, wait.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.044
- Who was that?
- It's the front desk.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.812
The hats arrived, so...

31:55.814 --> 31:57.848
- The hats? Oh, careful.
- (clattering)

31:57.850 --> 31:59.716
Toni: <i> I think</i>
<i> it's going pretty well.</i>

31:59.718 --> 32:00.851
<i> I've got GoFundMe.</i>

32:00.853 --> 32:04.621
I'm also... I just set up
a profile for him on IMDb.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.791
Do you know what IMDb is?
It's an actors' website.

32:07.793 --> 32:11.395
Have a gorgeous picture,
a couple of videos of him.

32:11.397 --> 32:15.899
It looks like ABC is interested
in picking up our story.

32:15.901 --> 32:18.669
So I'm gonna
keep on top of that.

32:18.737 --> 32:19.836
I had a connection there,

32:19.838 --> 32:22.039
so I did speak
with that connection,

32:22.041 --> 32:23.640
and he referred me
to somebody else.

32:23.642 --> 32:26.810
We're going door to door.
I mean, we're doing everything

32:26.812 --> 32:29.479
- physically possible.
- (knocking)

32:29.682 --> 32:30.414
Oh.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.848
- Is that Tim? Yeah.
- Tim: Toni?

32:31.850 --> 32:34.918
- Hey. I don't have my key.
- Toni: Okay. I'm coming.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.553
Give me a sec.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.822
That was fast. Wow.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.258
- Hi. Yeah. This is it.
- Hi.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.726
How are there 500 hats in here?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.861
Toni: It looks like there
might be five hats in there.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.531
- Toni: Who ordered the hats?
- Tim: You ordered the hats.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.600
I don't remember
ordering five hats.

32:50.602 --> 32:55.372
(clears throat) Yep.
There's one, two, three hats.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.440
There's not even...

32:56.442 --> 32:58.041
- There's three hats.
- I'll have to call them.

32:58.043 --> 32:59.977
Let me put it on my list.
Hold on.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.412
'Cause I think we paid
for those, yeah?

33:02.414 --> 33:04.247
I'll make a call.
I'll send an email,

33:04.249 --> 33:06.383
and then I'll follow up
with a phone call.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.685
Very nice. (clears throat)

33:09.054 --> 33:10.287
Tim: Here.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.025
Toni: Yeah,
it's really nice, Tim.

33:15.027 --> 33:17.227
Mm-hmm. Put it on.

33:18.697 --> 33:19.963
Oh.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.699
(sighs)

33:24.703 --> 33:27.871
Yeah, it's nice.
Yeah, I like it.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.240
- Really nice.
- Tim: Figure out this...

33:30.242 --> 33:32.109
- Toni: Yeah, I'll take care
of it right now.
- There's no point

33:32.111 --> 33:34.077
in five... three fucking hats.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.546
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.

33:36.548 --> 33:39.649
- (clattering)
- I just...

33:40.586 --> 33:43.153
(clattering)

33:48.060 --> 33:51.161
Point of three hats are,
one for me, you,

33:51.163 --> 33:53.263
and the volunteer we don't have.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.834
Toni: Tim, there's wine
in the other room.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.636
- Why don't you have a glass?
- Tim: I might have a glass.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.205
Toni: It might calm you down
a little bit.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.207
(door closes)

34:08.813 --> 34:10.580
(watch chimes)

34:14.585 --> 34:17.454
All right,
let's pound some pavement.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.696
- Tim: Hello.
- man: How you doing?

34:26.697 --> 34:28.331
Tim: Good. How are you guys?

34:28.333 --> 34:32.369
¶ (rap music playing) ¶

34:32.471 --> 34:34.438
So, you getting a haircut?

34:35.574 --> 34:36.406
Cool.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.909
Are you a registered voter here
in San Bernardino?

34:39.911 --> 34:40.911
- Yeah.
- Cool.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.914
I want to eliminate crime
from the entire region...

34:44.315 --> 34:46.449
and basically have
a zero-tolerance policy

34:46.452 --> 34:49.652
for anybody that breaks the law.
I mean, it's not that...

34:49.655 --> 34:51.054
I don't want to disrupt
your, uh,

34:51.056 --> 34:52.789
- concentration there.
- No, you're fine, you're fine.

34:52.791 --> 34:57.794
I'd probably not be
so kind on people...

34:57.796 --> 34:58.829
no offense to you guys,

34:58.831 --> 35:00.630
but listening
to that kind of music.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.800
I'd put a clamp down
on that kind of stuff...

35:04.369 --> 35:07.537
just 'cause it's so...
you know, encourages violence.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.906
You know, sort of taking
San Bernardino

35:09.908 --> 35:11.808
back to the good old days.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.211
Okay. I hear that.
Curtain down on E Street?

35:14.213 --> 35:15.445
That's right.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.214
man:

35:17.216 --> 35:18.748
Well... (laughs)

35:18.750 --> 35:20.417
...I know what you mean by that.

35:20.419 --> 35:23.453
But it's complicated.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.622
Things are changing.

35:26.959 --> 35:27.991
All right?

35:27.993 --> 35:30.594
- (bell chimes)
- Tim: Hello.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.429
Running for District Attorney.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.630
Sorry. I do not mean to solicit.

35:33.632 --> 35:38.268
I'm just... free speech,
First Amendment, ability to...

35:38.270 --> 35:40.337
woman:

35:40.339 --> 35:42.472
- I'm sorry?
- woman:

35:42.474 --> 35:43.740
I do have permission. I have...

35:43.742 --> 35:46.109
From the county,
I have permission.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.411
I have permission
from the First Amendment.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.680
Look it up.
It's the Constitution.

35:51.617 --> 35:55.352
I have a First Amendment right
in the Constitution.

35:55.921 --> 35:59.990
I'm not filming you.
Get over yourself.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.163
woman:

36:09.301 --> 36:11.301
You'll vote for me!

36:11.436 --> 36:12.636
<i> Kind of the full screen.</i>

36:12.638 --> 36:14.971
Toni: <i> It is... Oh.</i>
<i> So, I hit full screen and...</i>

36:14.973 --> 36:16.540
- Tim: <i> Then play.</i>
- Toni: <i> ...then "play."</i>

36:16.542 --> 36:18.375
<i> Okay. Got it. Okay.</i>

36:20.546 --> 36:22.012
Okay.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.082
Tim: No.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.757
- Toni: What?
- (Tim sighs)

36:33.759 --> 36:35.325
Press play.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.793
- Press pl...
- There we go. I got it.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.495
man: <i> For District Attorney</i>
<i> Vincent Rosetti,</i>

36:38.497 --> 36:41.031
<i> protecting our community</i>

36:41.033 --> 36:42.566
-<i> It's a calling.</i>

37:11.196 --> 37:14.364
"I am District Attorney
Vincent Rosetti."

37:14.900 --> 37:16.333
- That sucks.
- What the hell?

37:16.335 --> 37:17.901
I don't know.
Is it a good thing or not?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.569
- I don't know.
- I... I don't...

37:19.571 --> 37:20.804
We don't want negative press,

37:20.806 --> 37:23.873
but, you know, you want
an acknowledgement that there's,

37:23.875 --> 37:25.342
that we're in
the arena together.

37:25.344 --> 37:28.011
But any press is good press.
You know what I'm saying?

37:28.013 --> 37:29.279
There's no press for us.

37:29.281 --> 37:32.082
We should put out a statement
about that at least.

37:32.084 --> 37:33.550
Yeah, I'm gonna...
As soon as I get...

37:33.552 --> 37:36.786
Put out a press release from me,
basically...

37:36.788 --> 37:40.590
- (exhales)
- Get this... get this down.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.725
You want the computer off?

37:41.727 --> 37:43.660
No, I'm saying put the...
write this down.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.362
All right, well, do you
have some suggestions?

37:45.364 --> 37:46.863
- What are you...
- I'm telling you

37:46.865 --> 37:48.865
- I want to send
a press release out, so...
- Okay.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.701
All right. Will do.

37:54.840 --> 37:55.872
Tim: All right, ready?

37:55.874 --> 37:58.842
Get a Word document open
or something.

37:58.844 --> 37:59.876
Do you not have Word?

37:59.878 --> 38:02.245
Toni: I don't know where
it is on this.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.014
Let me see. Hold on.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.783
That's to open the files.

38:08.387 --> 38:09.319
(computer dings)

38:09.321 --> 38:11.554
You should have sent this to me
on my computer.

38:11.556 --> 38:15.692
- Write it on your notepad or...
- Oh, here, we got it.

38:15.694 --> 38:18.628
Okay. Documents. Geez!

38:18.964 --> 38:20.297
- Here.
- I'm losing my train

38:20.299 --> 38:22.632
of thought here.
Just make a note.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.803
"To whom it may concern...

38:27.039 --> 38:30.907
I have recently viewed
the Vincent Rosetti attack ad."

38:30.909 --> 38:33.009
- "Rebuttal."
- No. I...

38:33.011 --> 38:35.645
I got it. "Vincent Rosetti."

38:36.048 --> 38:41.451
"I have recently viewed
the Vincent Rosetti attack ad...

38:42.554 --> 38:45.622
which was more full of lies
than...

38:45.891 --> 38:47.991
whatever, a...

38:48.627 --> 38:50.293
Yeah, but it wasn't an attack
against you.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.362
- You weren't even in there.
- No, I know,
but it was an offic...

38:52.364 --> 38:54.097
It was an... It was an attack
against Sandoval.

38:54.099 --> 38:58.001
How about this?
"The recent Rosetti..."

38:59.671 --> 39:00.937
"The recent Rosetti..."

39:00.939 --> 39:03.106
Write that down,
"The recent Rosetti."

39:03.108 --> 39:04.140
What are you doing?

39:04.142 --> 39:06.376
You know what I think
we should do, honestly?

39:06.378 --> 39:10.413
I think that we should leave
Sandoval out of it completely.

39:10.415 --> 39:13.083
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- Yeah. And just go after...

39:13.085 --> 39:16.953
- Listen, just write what I'm...
- Go ahead. I'm listening.

39:16.955 --> 39:22.892
"The recent Rosetti ad
that I saw on YouTube is so...

39:22.894 --> 39:26.463
is dishonest, even for him."

39:28.200 --> 39:28.965
(burps)

39:28.967 --> 39:32.402
"Now that the race
is tightening"...

39:33.538 --> 39:36.072
"Now that the race
is tightening...

39:37.309 --> 39:41.878
we see the rat beginning
to scow... beginning to cower."

39:42.247 --> 39:43.580
Mm-hmm.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.416
Anything else?

39:47.285 --> 39:48.351
No. I mean, all the...

39:48.353 --> 39:49.819
"Visit the website"
and all that crap.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.721
- But we need to get our own ad.
- Yeah. We will.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.557
And we need to get a film crew
down here.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.092
I mean, these guys could do it,
but they say

39:56.094 --> 39:58.528
they're not gonna do it.
I've asked them 20 times.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.763
Why can't they do it?

39:59.765 --> 40:02.766
- They've got cameras.
- They say it's impartial
journalism or some shit.

40:02.768 --> 40:03.967
I mean, he's scared, right?

40:03.969 --> 40:06.870
That's what I...
That's what it's about.

40:06.872 --> 40:07.837
He's scared.

40:07.839 --> 40:12.742
He doesn't want to mention me
in the ad because he's so...

40:12.744 --> 40:14.043
Toni: Oh!

40:14.479 --> 40:21.184
So nervous about the mere
mention of my name than...

40:22.220 --> 40:23.253
He's so...

40:23.255 --> 40:25.455
Here, let me get
a napkin for you.

40:25.457 --> 40:28.458
- Where are the napkins here?
- Tim: "He's so scared."

40:28.460 --> 40:30.326
- Viral campaign that's...
- Toni: Here you go.

40:30.328 --> 40:31.661
- There you go.
- Tim: Thank you.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.730
- You're welcome.
- Tim: That's gotten...

40:34.032 --> 40:36.032
Oh, it's on the floor.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.434
Toni: I'm listening to you.
Go ahead.

40:37.436 --> 40:40.003
Tim: I'm saying, so, there is...

40:40.238 --> 40:41.438
If he brings my name, people go,

40:41.440 --> 40:43.540
"Oh, that's the guy
with the 'rat problem' sign."

40:43.542 --> 40:44.574
We can ignore the ad.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.075
We don't have to directly talk

40:46.077 --> 40:47.444
- about the ad.
- The ad is crap.

40:47.446 --> 40:49.612
The ad is terrible anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

40:49.614 --> 40:50.880
Let's just not focus on that.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.749
- Let's just focus on us.
- I'm not worried about it.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.684
- I'm not worried
about it, actually.
- Toni: Are you sure?

40:54.686 --> 40:56.152
Because it seems
to bother you a lot.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.053
Absolutely not.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.621
Should we report that,
though, because...

40:58.623 --> 41:01.224
- report that to YouTube.
- Toni: I don't think you can.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.525
I think he paid for it legally.

41:02.527 --> 41:04.627
- I understand,
but there's factual in...
- Toni: You can't report it.

41:04.629 --> 41:05.829
inaccuracies in there.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.464
It is what it is.
It's out there.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.532
- We, you know...
- Toni: Yeah.

41:09.534 --> 41:10.767
Our preference would be that...

41:10.769 --> 41:12.869
I think our preference is
that we're mentioned in there

41:12.871 --> 41:15.238
because that at least provides
a little contrast.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.040
Toni: That we are?
We're not mentioned.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.441
- It's good.
- I know, but I'm saying

41:18.443 --> 41:20.910
we should... it would be better,
but it's not there.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.011
That's the reality.

41:22.013 --> 41:26.516
Um, you know, we have to just
look at tomorrow as a new day

41:26.518 --> 41:30.987
and do... you know,
get our to-do list going again

41:30.989 --> 41:33.623
and... (burps)

41:35.026 --> 41:36.526
...you know...

41:37.896 --> 41:39.796
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.365
(Toni sighs)

41:43.635 --> 41:46.503

with the petition
for the ballot.

43:06.084 --> 43:09.552
And it's not... I know
it's not what you want to see.

43:09.554 --> 43:11.154
- Um...
- Toni: Oh, my God, Tim.

43:11.156 --> 43:13.990
Yeah, I mean, well, we have...
add 30 from the website,

43:13.992 --> 43:18.695
from the petition we put up
on the Internet, but, um...

43:18.697 --> 43:21.364
Tim, this is not gonna cut it.

43:21.366 --> 43:23.333
This is not gonna get us
on the ballot.

43:23.335 --> 43:25.001
- You realize that.
- Tim: I understand. I know.

43:25.003 --> 43:26.869
We're hundreds away,
hundreds of signatures away.

43:26.871 --> 43:29.505
- Hundreds and hundreds away.
- Tim: I know.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.507
Toni: I think we need to sit
and strategize

43:31.509 --> 43:32.542
about this right now.

43:32.544 --> 43:34.310
- Okay.
- Do you think it'd be possible

43:34.312 --> 43:36.479
that we could have
a little privacy, um,

43:36.481 --> 43:40.116
just a little alone time
so that Tim and I can just...

43:40.118 --> 43:42.452
Tim: Josh, I think probably
a good idea

43:42.454 --> 43:44.854
to maybe
take a five-minute break.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.489
Toni: If you don't mind,
just so we can have

43:46.491 --> 43:48.658
- a few moments
to kind of reset.
- Yeah. We're getting into some

43:48.660 --> 43:49.792
sensitive territory here.

43:49.794 --> 43:51.628
- Josh: Sure. Yeah, you guys...
- Toni: Yeah.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.763
Tim: She's been... Yeah,
she's a little uncomfortable

43:53.765 --> 43:55.365
about being on camera.

43:55.367 --> 43:56.699
- Toni: Yeah.
- Tim: You know?

43:56.701 --> 43:59.002
- Tim: Thanks. Thanks, guys.
- Toni: We really appreciate it.

43:59.004 --> 44:00.637
Tim: And we have a...
You know, if you want

44:00.639 --> 44:02.472
to get something down
at the snack bar or anything,

44:02.474 --> 44:05.908
you can just put it
on the room, all right?

44:06.511 --> 44:09.445
- (door closes)
- They're gonna check
the address.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.847
They're not gonna check
the address.

44:10.849 --> 44:13.049
That was my point, that this is
all just a formality.

44:13.051 --> 44:14.784
- So let's just get into it.
- All right.

44:14.786 --> 44:18.421
John, uh... It doesn't matter.
John...

44:18.423 --> 44:20.390
- Trevor.
- ...Grover.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.357
Trevor Smith.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.626
- Peter...
- That's really close,

44:23.628 --> 44:25.294
so you're gonna need
to mix it up a little bit.

44:25.296 --> 44:27.897
Yeah, I'll change...
Why don't we change pens...

44:27.899 --> 44:29.666
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- ...kind of randomly?

44:29.668 --> 44:32.402
Toni: So, look.
You see how I varied everything?

44:32.404 --> 44:33.336
Tim: Mm-hmm.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.838
- So you got a Trevor Smith.
- Tim: Put this...

44:35.840 --> 44:38.274
Yeah, but why don't I do...
I'll do some on here.

44:38.276 --> 44:41.210
- Toni: All right.
- Tim: And, um...

44:41.646 --> 44:44.514
Amy... Masters.

44:44.516 --> 44:46.282
- (Toni laughs) There you go.
- (Tim laughs)

44:46.284 --> 44:47.717
Tim: You do one,
and then I'll do one.

44:47.719 --> 44:52.255
- Perfect.
- Jason... Davidson.

44:52.524 --> 44:53.556
How about Johnny Mathis?

44:53.558 --> 44:56.392
- (Toni laughs)
- Johnny Mathis. Tom Cruise.

44:56.394 --> 44:58.428
- I'll make it Tom Cruise Jr.
- Oh, I'd like

44:58.430 --> 45:00.530
to make it Tom Cruise.

45:00.532 --> 45:01.798
What's the camera guy's name?

45:01.800 --> 45:04.033
- Vincent Price, huh?
- (laughs) No, don't do that.

45:04.035 --> 45:05.601
No? Why not? Who cares?

45:05.603 --> 45:06.703
I mean, it's all guys.

45:06.705 --> 45:08.304
- That's my problem.
- Do you have any siblings?

45:08.306 --> 45:10.907
Uh, no. I did,
but she's passed away.

45:10.909 --> 45:13.009
- She passed away
a couple years ago.
- I'll put my

45:13.011 --> 45:14.077
sister's name down.

45:14.079 --> 45:17.847
Joe Estevez. He would have
signed it. He's a friend.

45:17.916 --> 45:20.383
All right, good.
And now that's one, two...

45:20.385 --> 45:21.284
that's 20.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.252
Oh, my God, this is gonna
take us all night.

45:23.254 --> 45:24.554
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

45:24.556 --> 45:26.656
- (Tim burps)
- You better grab another beer.

45:26.658 --> 45:28.224
Another bottle of wine
for me, too.

45:28.226 --> 45:29.759
Where's the wine?

45:31.529 --> 45:35.064
Here you go, baby.
It's all good.

45:35.133 --> 45:35.965
Awesome.

uh, assault this motherfucker
when I see him.

45:58.389 --> 45:59.555
I have to hold back.

45:59.557 --> 46:01.257
I mean, I'm getting
my adrenaline up,

46:01.259 --> 46:04.026

Listen, I'm gonna go to him

46:04.028 --> 46:05.661
straight up to his face and say,

46:05.663 --> 46:08.030
"Motherfucker, you are
meeting me in the arena."

46:08.032 --> 46:09.699
I don't know. I don't know how
to predict it.

46:09.701 --> 46:10.933
I think he might take the bait.

46:10.935 --> 46:13.703
I think he might step right into
my trap and actually show up...

46:13.705 --> 46:17.306
We hope he does, 'cause I think
we should hear from him.

46:17.308 --> 46:18.574
He has to answer for his crimes.

47:34.686 --> 47:37.086
so we can get this debate
going tomorrow night.

47:37.088 --> 47:39.555
And he should be out here
for his lunch break.

47:39.557 --> 47:42.725
It's been... He should have been
out here ten minutes ago.

47:42.727 --> 47:47.830
All right, we are...
It's been 20 minutes, and uh...

47:47.932 --> 47:51.667
There he is. All right,
here we go. We're going live.

47:51.669 --> 47:54.103
Hey, Vincent! Rosetti!

47:54.105 --> 47:56.472
How you doing?
It's Tim Heidecker.

47:56.474 --> 47:58.007
How come you
haven't called back?

47:58.009 --> 47:59.075
We've left you messages.

47:59.077 --> 48:01.444
We're challenging you
to a debate tomorrow night

48:01.446 --> 48:04.714
at the Lincoln Suites downtown.

48:04.883 --> 48:05.915
You should join us.

48:05.917 --> 48:07.283
I'd love to talk to you
about the issues.

48:07.285 --> 48:08.751
You have anything to say?

48:08.753 --> 48:10.353
You can't be serious, Heidecker.

48:10.355 --> 48:11.320
No, I am serious.

48:11.322 --> 48:12.822
Why don't you want
to debate me, rat?

48:12.824 --> 48:14.590
- You're a clown, Heidecker.
<i> -</i> You're a clown.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.125
Oh, I'd rather be a clown
than a rat.

48:16.127 --> 48:17.927
- I don't have time for this.
- Tim: You don't have time.

48:17.929 --> 48:19.962
- This conversation is over.
- Tim: Okay.

48:19.964 --> 48:21.464
- Thank you.
- Get out of my way, please.

48:21.466 --> 48:23.833
How come you couldn't beat me
in court?

48:23.835 --> 48:25.001
What kind of DA is that?

48:25.003 --> 48:29.605
- First time in a courtroom me,
first time... Oh!
- (car horn honking)

48:29.707 --> 48:31.607
Folks, Vincent Rosetti,

48:31.609 --> 48:33.409
District Attorney
of San Bernardino,

48:33.411 --> 48:34.510
is trying to kill me.

48:34.512 --> 48:36.112
It's attempted murder
happening right here

48:36.114 --> 48:40.049
in front of the DA's office,
with his Honda piece of shit...

48:40.051 --> 48:43.052
Hey! Are you... Fuck you!

48:43.054 --> 48:45.354
Yeah. Oh, I got that on tape,
scumbag.

48:45.356 --> 48:50.092
I got your license plate.
7-B-N-V-6-0-0.

48:50.094 --> 48:53.896
<i> That is... Vincent Rosetti</i>
<i> just tried to kill me</i>
<i> on camera.</i>

48:53.898 --> 48:57.466
<i> We have it on camera.</i>
<i> He refuses to debate me.</i>

48:57.468 --> 48:59.835
Woo! That was awesome.
You guys get that?

48:59.837 --> 49:03.539
I think Tim's running for DA
because he's just angry

49:03.541 --> 49:06.742
because Rosetti
did a really good job.

49:06.744 --> 49:08.844
<i> The case didn't go the way</i>
<i> Rosetti wanted,</i>

49:08.846 --> 49:10.579
<i> but to the people</i>
<i> that watched it,</i>

49:10.581 --> 49:14.350
<i> Tim was very, very guilty</i>
<i> and looked like a real fool.</i>

49:14.352 --> 49:17.253
He just always wants
to get revenge against anybody.

49:17.255 --> 49:19.255
Like, for instance,
I got free tickets

49:19.257 --> 49:22.091
to the <i> Sully</i> premiere...
not even the premiere,

49:22.093 --> 49:24.827
but the pre-premiere,
like the critics screenings.

49:24.829 --> 49:27.563
He was jealous 'cause he was
probably passed out

49:27.565 --> 49:29.165
somewhere in his vape den.

49:29.167 --> 49:31.500
And then I'm telling everyone,
"Oh,<i> Sully</i> is great.

49:31.502 --> 49:34.503
This is the film of the year.
This is gonna win Oscars."

49:34.505 --> 49:36.505
And he's like, "What's <i> Sully?"</i>

49:36.507 --> 49:38.574
I think if you point it back
at him

49:38.576 --> 49:39.709
with a lot of these things,

49:39.711 --> 49:41.277
turn it around
and point it at him,

49:41.279 --> 49:42.611
and you'll find out the truth.

49:42.613 --> 49:45.581
I saw it in the first group
of 300 people

49:45.583 --> 49:46.682
ever to see <i> Sully.</i>

49:46.684 --> 49:48.684
Tim: <i> We're in a town hall</i>
<i> debate tomorrow</i>

49:48.686 --> 49:50.286
<i> for District Attorney,</i>
<i> if you're interested.</i>

49:50.288 --> 49:52.188
- woman: Sure.
- Thanks. I forgot to put the...

49:52.190 --> 49:55.057
(chuckles) ...forgot to put
the time and date on it.

49:55.059 --> 49:57.026
- So, it's tomorrow.
- woman: Tomorrow.

49:57.028 --> 49:57.793
Yep.

49:57.795 --> 50:01.998
<i> Toni forgot to put the date</i>
<i> and time</i>

50:02.000 --> 50:04.967
<i> on the town hall debate</i>
<i> happening tomorrow.</i>

50:04.969 --> 50:06.535
<i> But it's no problem.</i>
<i> I'm just...</i>

50:06.537 --> 50:09.238
<i> I'm just kind of putting</i>
<i> a little personal touch on it.</i>

50:09.240 --> 50:10.473
<i> Me, Rosetti, and Sandoval</i>

50:10.475 --> 50:13.309
<i> are gonna be talking</i>
<i> about the issues tomorrow.</i>

50:13.311 --> 50:14.977
And I'm looking forward to it.

50:14.979 --> 50:17.046
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> in a million years</i>
<i> I would have thought</i>

50:17.048 --> 50:20.349
<i> I would be standing in front</i>
<i> of San Bernardino City Hall</i>

50:20.351 --> 50:24.320
<i> knowing that I was only</i>
<i> a few steps away from becoming</i>

50:24.322 --> 50:27.890
<i> not only District Attorney,</i>
<i> but hopefully even higher</i>

50:27.892 --> 50:31.093
<i> in the chain of command</i>
<i> within San Bernardino.</i>

50:31.095 --> 50:34.363
<i> So, you know,</i>
<i> it's starting to feel real.</i>

50:34.365 --> 50:36.732
<i> I'm not nervous.</i>
<i> I just feel a sense</i>

50:36.734 --> 50:38.768
<i>of obligation to the community</i>

50:38.770 --> 50:41.704
<i> that I'm doing this</i>
<i> for the right reasons.</i>

50:41.873 --> 50:45.307
There's
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr...

50:45.309 --> 50:50.579
poster... a statue of him,
one of the founding fathers.

50:50.581 --> 50:53.349
Uh, you know, just one
of the people I look up to

50:53.351 --> 50:58.087
and I'm always quoting
and using his message

50:58.089 --> 51:02.124
to get me through, you know,
what I'm going through.

51:02.126 --> 51:04.193
One of the great citizens
of San Bernardino and...

51:04.195 --> 51:06.762
was one of the greats.
Unfortunately, he passed.

51:06.764 --> 51:10.800
But we are always remembering
his words and deeds.

51:10.802 --> 51:13.702
So, I'm gonna go pay homage
to him privately.

51:13.704 --> 51:19.308
- (siren wailing)
- (firetruck horn honking)

51:19.310 --> 51:22.511
Tim: <i> I can feel the energy</i>
<i> coming off something like that,</i>

51:22.513 --> 51:24.313
<i> such, uh, a great icon</i>

51:24.315 --> 51:27.817
<i> of the San Bernardino Valley</i>
<i> and the county.</i>

51:27.819 --> 51:29.819
<i> You know, as I come</i>
<i> to work each day,</i>

51:29.821 --> 51:32.555
<i> obviously I'll be at</i>
<i> the District Attorney's office,</i>

51:32.557 --> 51:35.324
but I'm sure I'll be scrambling
to and fro,

51:35.326 --> 51:38.928
visiting City Hall,
chiming in on new laws.

51:38.930 --> 51:40.496
I'm sure I will stop each time

51:40.498 --> 51:42.531
and pay my respects
to this beautiful fountain,

51:42.533 --> 51:46.402
this rushing water,
reminiscent of the Rio Grande

51:46.404 --> 51:47.536
or the great Mississippi

51:47.538 --> 51:49.605
or any of the rivers
of our great country,

51:49.607 --> 51:52.007
and pausing to reflect
on the message

51:52.009 --> 51:53.342
of Dr. Martin Luther King.

51:53.344 --> 51:57.847
It's fitting that San Bernardino
has such a monument here,

51:57.849 --> 52:02.585
and I'm glad we got to spend
some time enjoying it together.

52:02.587 --> 52:05.821
Josh, if you want to get
your picture taken with it.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.893
Gregg: Hey, guys.

52:10.895 --> 52:13.562
<i> Josh.</i>
<i> What are you guys shooting?</i>

52:13.664 --> 52:15.898
Josh: Uh, just some B-roll.

52:16.267 --> 52:19.401
A lot of cool movies
shot in San Bernardino.

52:19.403 --> 52:20.336
You know <i> Congo?</i>

52:20.338 --> 52:22.037
You'll never guess
where that was shot.

52:22.039 --> 52:24.507
They actually shot
the airport scenes right here

52:24.509 --> 52:26.775
at the San Bernardino Airport...

52:26.777 --> 52:29.512
- Josh: I didn't know that.
- ...not in the Congo.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.546
Kind of cool.

52:30.548 --> 52:33.249
<i> Independence Day,</i> too,
they shot in Fontana.

52:33.251 --> 52:36.352
Josh: Sorry I didn't, uh...
I got your messages.

52:36.354 --> 52:38.721
Yeah. Um,
I wanted to talk to you

52:38.723 --> 52:41.056
about this <i> Shaggy DA</i> thing,
and then, also,

52:41.058 --> 52:42.558
I had this idea...

52:42.560 --> 52:45.928
and if you guys are into it,
we go to a Baskin-Robbins

52:45.930 --> 52:48.631
and shoot me coming out
of the Baskin-Robbins...

52:48.633 --> 52:49.899
- Josh: Oh.
- ...sort of like

52:49.901 --> 52:51.400
as the character
from <i> Ant-Man...</i>

52:51.402 --> 52:52.835
- Josh: Mm-hmm.
- ...just coming out

52:52.837 --> 52:56.138
of the thing. And then I can
talk to you guys or whatever,

52:56.140 --> 52:57.039
be in character.

52:57.041 --> 52:58.707
Josh: Yeah. I don't know
if we can do that today.

52:58.709 --> 53:00.609
- Maybe, um...
- There's a Baskin-Robbins.

53:00.611 --> 53:03.913
I checked. It's about a mile
from here, on 5th.

53:03.915 --> 53:06.182
Josh: We got a lot of stuff
we got to cover today.

53:06.184 --> 53:07.883
We're meeting back up with Tim
in a little bit.

53:07.885 --> 53:10.052
Well, you've got enough of him,
I'm sure.

53:10.054 --> 53:11.487
We've actually
got to get going now.

53:11.489 --> 53:13.656
We have a couple other spots
we have to hit up.

53:13.658 --> 53:16.825
- But it was nice
running into you.
- Okay, well, I'll come along.

53:16.827 --> 53:18.394
Josh: That's okay.

53:37.582 --> 53:40.416
- Manuel: <i> How are you, man?</i>
- Tim: <i> Hey, man.</i>

53:40.418 --> 53:42.384
I'm fucking tired.

53:42.386 --> 53:44.353
- What time is it there, man?
- Manuel: <i> How are you, man?</i>

53:44.355 --> 53:45.554
<i> So good to hear from you.</i>

53:45.556 --> 53:48.424
Yeah. Good to hear from you,
man. It's...

53:48.926 --> 53:50.259
- What?
- Manuel: <i> It's 4:20</i>

53:50.261 --> 53:52.494
<i> in the morning.</i>
<i> 4:20 in the morning.</i>

53:52.496 --> 53:54.697
You're probably up partying.

53:55.066 --> 53:57.866
<i> You know, Manuel has...</i>

53:57.868 --> 54:00.536
<i> Because of what happened</i>
<i> with him at the trial,</i>

54:00.538 --> 54:02.871
<i>he's essentially back in Italy.</i>

54:02.873 --> 54:07.977
"I, Dr. San, am only one
responsible for all the death

54:07.979 --> 54:10.379
from the Electric Sun 20.

54:10.381 --> 54:11.747
It is all my fault."

54:11.749 --> 54:13.983
You took an oath,
and you swore before God

54:13.985 --> 54:16.352
- that you would tell the truth.
- Come on.

54:16.354 --> 54:18.787
I'm gonna ask you now
one more time.

54:18.789 --> 54:20.422
Who wrote the letter?

54:20.424 --> 54:22.691
- Tim gave it to me
this morning.
- Vincent: Okay.

54:22.693 --> 54:24.126
He talks like
they're his friends

54:24.128 --> 54:26.095
and says they're his rock
and all this stuff,

54:26.097 --> 54:29.331
but those guys, believe me,
the minute he doesn't pay them,

54:29.333 --> 54:30.633
<i> you don't see them around.</i>

54:30.635 --> 54:32.234
<i> They're gone for long periods</i>
<i> of time.</i>

54:32.236 --> 54:34.870
<i> And then he gets a little bit</i>
<i> of money through some scam,</i>

54:34.872 --> 54:36.839
<i> and then suddenly,</i>
<i> there's Axiom, Manuel,</i>

54:36.841 --> 54:39.174
and they're doing
recordings again.

54:39.176 --> 54:42.611
You are so worried
about this perjury shit

54:42.613 --> 54:43.846
from the trial, that...

54:43.848 --> 54:46.615
it is not something
that they're gonna follow up on

54:46.617 --> 54:47.783
because when you get back here,

54:47.785 --> 54:50.152
I'm gonna be in charge
of that shit.

54:50.154 --> 54:52.087
You know what I mean?

54:52.823 --> 54:53.656
Manuel:

54:53.658 --> 54:58.093
And Axiom's not calling me back,
and he's being, you know...

54:58.095 --> 55:03.399
like suddenly creating a wall
that I don't understand.

55:03.634 --> 55:04.667
Hold on, Manuel.

55:04.669 --> 55:06.168
- Toni!
- Toni: Yeah?

55:06.170 --> 55:08.537
Can you get another one
of these, please?

55:08.539 --> 55:10.639
- Toni: Uh, sure.
- Thanks.

55:12.543 --> 55:14.410
I'm sorry.
I'm doing this campaign,

55:14.412 --> 55:19.381
and we're, like, trying to get
this town hall thing going.

55:19.383 --> 55:20.883
It's like... It's not as easy

55:20.885 --> 55:22.985
as just going down
and playing a show.

55:22.987 --> 55:25.454
- And I'm doing this...
- Manuel:

55:25.456 --> 55:28.957
I'm doing this
with this woman who's...

55:28.959 --> 55:31.427
- What is it?
- We need to talk.

55:31.429 --> 55:32.928
- Okay.
- So?

55:32.930 --> 55:34.063
- Right now?
- Yeah.

55:34.065 --> 55:35.464
- Okay. Hold on.
- Come on out.

55:35.466 --> 55:37.533
- Get off the phone
and come out and talk.
- I can't get out. Hold on.

55:37.535 --> 55:39.201
Manuel, baby, I got
to call you back, man.

55:39.203 --> 55:43.339
Keep rocking, and I love you,
and we'll talk soon.

55:44.075 --> 55:46.508
- Manuel:
- Cheers.

55:46.777 --> 55:48.377
Ciao.

55:48.679 --> 55:51.380
- What's up?
- Well...

55:51.482 --> 55:54.183
- I sort of have some bad news.
- Okay.

55:54.185 --> 55:56.552
I had all of these guys
in the loop,

55:56.554 --> 55:59.555
and they've all pretty much
just dropped out.

55:59.557 --> 56:00.622
Tim: Mm-hmm.

56:00.624 --> 56:02.658
I mean, everything
was in a pending mode.

56:02.660 --> 56:04.660
I can't even get <i> The Sun</i>
to come.

56:04.662 --> 56:06.161
- What do you mean?
- I can't even get

56:06.163 --> 56:07.863
- the <i> San Bernardino Sun.</i>
- They're not com...

56:07.865 --> 56:09.398
- They're not...
- They're not coming, Tim.

56:09.400 --> 56:11.567
- They said they're not coming?
- They said they're not coming.

56:11.569 --> 56:13.168
Why wouldn't they come?
It's a...

56:13.170 --> 56:16.271
- it's an official campaign.
- I know. I unders...

56:16.273 --> 56:17.439
You're telling me they're not...

56:17.441 --> 56:18.941
they've confirmed to you
that they're not coming?

56:18.943 --> 56:21.276
They've confirmed
that they're not coming.

56:21.278 --> 56:22.444
- Ugh!
- They actually sent me

56:22.446 --> 56:24.947
an email
and it wasn't a very nice one.

56:24.949 --> 56:25.647
Hmm.

56:25.649 --> 56:26.782
We're gonna do the best we can.

56:26.784 --> 56:28.884
And what about Rosetti
and Sandoval?

56:28.886 --> 56:30.519
I haven't heard
from either of them.

56:30.521 --> 56:32.020
- They won't confirm.
- All right, well,

56:32.022 --> 56:34.823
I mean, so,
what are we doing tomorrow?

56:39.630 --> 56:42.965
Tim: <i> Toni put the big ad</i>
<i> for the town hall</i>

56:42.967 --> 56:45.367
in the, uh, paper this morning.

56:46.036 --> 56:47.569
(coins clinking)

56:48.105 --> 56:49.538
Last one.

56:51.375 --> 56:53.008
(horn honks)

56:57.448 --> 57:01.016
It's not supposed
to be in Sports. Let me just...

57:02.420 --> 57:05.421
Call Toni Newman.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.359
Hey, Siri. Toni,
I'll bring it back to the room,

57:10.361 --> 57:12.828
but I'm telling you,
there's no ad

57:12.830 --> 57:14.062
for the town hall debate.

57:14.064 --> 57:18.434
The "We have a rat problem" ad
isn't in there, either, so...

57:19.603 --> 57:22.104
Well, that's a lot of money.

57:22.106 --> 57:24.606
It doesn't do us any good
to put it in tomorrow.

57:24.608 --> 57:28.177
You know what I mean?
I'm not saying it's your fault.

57:28.179 --> 57:30.379
I'm saying that
it's not in the paper.

57:30.381 --> 57:31.246
That's the news.

57:31.248 --> 57:33.315
So, I'll be back
in a few minutes.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.784
All right, yeah. Take care.

57:36.187 --> 57:38.287
All right. Love you, too.

57:38.789 --> 57:42.357
<i> She said she put that ad</i>
<i> in like a week ago</i>

57:42.359 --> 57:43.625
<i> and that they needed more...</i>

57:43.627 --> 57:45.994
<i> that she thinks they might have</i>
<i> needed more time,</i>

57:45.996 --> 57:47.162
<i>but that sounds like bullshit.</i>

57:47.164 --> 57:48.864
I'm not worried about it
because print media's dead

57:48.866 --> 57:50.532
and there's not a lot of people
picking that up.

57:50.534 --> 57:54.403
You saw the disarray
that the news stand was in.

57:54.405 --> 57:56.104
Anyways, I don't... That's...

57:56.106 --> 57:58.941
We don't need to use that stuff
'cause I...

57:58.943 --> 58:00.309
I don't want to get her
in trouble.

58:00.311 --> 58:01.910
I don't want to...
It's nobody's fault.

58:01.912 --> 58:05.247
It's just...
There's a lot to do.

58:06.050 --> 58:08.750
(clears throat)
There's a lot to do.

58:17.461 --> 58:18.627
How's that look?

58:18.629 --> 58:22.164
Doing a little debate prep,
a little issue research.

58:22.166 --> 58:26.268
<i> You know, that's pretty much</i>
<i> my day, has been prepping</i>

58:26.270 --> 58:30.205
<i>so I'm as educated as I can be</i>
<i>on the issues of San Bernardino</i>

58:30.207 --> 58:32.007
<i> and also getting to a place</i>

58:32.009 --> 58:34.009
where we have a real
competitive chance to win.

58:34.011 --> 58:36.578
- Tim, where do you want to sit?
- Right in the middle.

58:36.580 --> 58:38.580
Right in the center? Okay.
I'll put you...

58:38.582 --> 58:39.615
I'm gonna put you here.

58:39.617 --> 58:41.183
Why don't we put a couple
on the table?

58:41.185 --> 58:42.851
- What do you think?
- Tim: Oh, on his seat.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.953
- Yeah. Or in front of him.
- (laughs) Yeah.

58:44.955 --> 58:46.188
Let's do it.

58:46.190 --> 58:48.090
We have a rat problem.

58:48.092 --> 58:49.324
- Tim: Yeah.
- (Toni laughs)

58:49.326 --> 58:51.360
I'm getting to the place
where I'm kind of off-book

58:51.362 --> 58:53.862
with this memorizing
all this stuff.

58:53.864 --> 58:55.631
And I got a hundred more
of these books

58:55.633 --> 58:58.667
waiting for me to put up here.

58:58.669 --> 58:59.735
It's going very well.

58:59.737 --> 59:01.436
The energy he had
in that parking lot

59:01.438 --> 59:02.905
and the confrontation
was he wanted

59:02.907 --> 59:04.206
to have nothing
to do with us.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.108
Well, if he doesn't show,
that makes him look bad.

59:06.110 --> 59:09.678
I think the plan should be,
at 7:15, if there's no...

59:09.680 --> 59:13.081
if Rosetti doesn't show
and if Carlos doesn't show,

59:13.083 --> 59:14.483
it becomes the town hall.

59:14.485 --> 59:16.451
- Becomes about you.
- It becomes about me.

59:16.453 --> 59:18.053
That's it.
That's what we want anyway.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.922
- All right, cool. All right.
- Awesome.

59:19.924 --> 59:21.523
I'm gonna clean up,
and I'm gonna head up

59:21.525 --> 59:22.858
- to the room.
- Toni: All right.

59:22.860 --> 59:24.192
- Tim: You want to come?
- You know what?

59:24.194 --> 59:25.694
Let me just tidy up
a little bit.

59:25.696 --> 59:28.130
- I'll meet you up there
in a second, okay?
- Tim: Okay. All right.

59:47.851 --> 59:49.618
(whispers) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

59:49.620 --> 59:54.590
<i> It's been an honor to be here</i>
<i> with you guys tonight.</i>

59:54.592 --> 59:56.458
<i> I want to talk to you</i>
<i> about why I'm running</i>

59:56.460 --> 59:59.528
<i> for District Attorney</i>
<i> of San Bernardino.</i>

59:59.530 --> 01:00:00.996
I'm gonna talk to you
about why...

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:03.131
I want to talk to you about why
I'm running for San Bern...

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:05.667
District Attorney
of San Bernardino.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:07.135
<i> You know, I'm an outsider.</i>

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.870
(clearing throat)
<i> My name is Tim Heidecker.</i>

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:12.908
<i> I'm running for District</i>
<i> Attorney of San Bernardino.</i>

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.610
<i> It's good to meet you guys.</i>

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.179
<i>Sold-out crowd. Unbelievable.</i>

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:20.482
<i> We know firsthand...</i>
<i> we know firsthand</i>

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:24.119
<i> that our community is suffering</i>
<i> from high rates of crime,</i>

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:31.760
<i> and my idea,</i>
<i> my campaign pledge is to...</i>

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:38.600
is to remove crime,
eliminate crime.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.005
Well, I'm looking
at the world now,

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.172
and it's going insane.

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:46.975
Toni: Well, I'll do
a brief introduction

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:50.112
so that it looks really nice
before you come in.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:51.380
What you got? I got some strays.

01:00:51.382 --> 01:00:53.415
- I've been working
on that all morning.
- (laughs) I know,

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:56.151
- let me fix it.
- Are we just saying goodbye
to the debate idea?

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.787
- 'Cause they're... I mean...
- Toni: Well, let's give them

01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:59.788
a little bit more time.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.223
I mean, they might
still show up.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:03.458
So, I mean, we're still just
a few minutes over, so...

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.527
I mean, we...
Okay, well, it's almost...

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:07.729
- It's 7:12 now.
- Yeah. I...

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.197
When are we pulling
the trigger on it?

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:10.666
Yeah, I don't have any messages
from them.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:12.100
How about you?
Do you have any messages?

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:13.268
No, my iWatch has been quiet.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.838
<i> I think we hit Rosetti</i>
<i> right away...</i>

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.674
<i> or not... or either</i>
<i> we're gonna save that</i>

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:20.442
<i> - as the closing...</i>
- Toni: <i> Why don't we do this?</i>

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:22.077
Why don't we go
with the positive first?

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:25.047
Let's make you look good,
make you look amazing.

01:01:25.049 --> 01:01:27.082
- Let's sell your points.
- I have one for one.

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:28.383
I don't want to say
"One for one."

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:29.651
I want to say
"Perfect record."

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:30.652
Well, let's just...

01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:32.054
- your accomplishments...
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:34.156
- ...your goals.
- Small business.

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:36.291
You look really nice, Tim.

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.694
- Thank you.
- And you're gonna wow them.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:40.462
Just get your mouth wet.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:41.630
What do you have? Is it Orbits?

01:01:41.632 --> 01:01:43.598
(Toni laughs)
It's your favorite. Of course.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.900
- Great.
- Toni: How'd you know?

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:47.936
- Well, I know you carry Orbits.
- There you go.

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:49.738
Good luck.
We'll see you in there, okay?

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.339
- Okay. See you.
- Toni: See you in a minute.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.709
- Yeah. We'll talk soon.
- Toni: Okay.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:26.007
Hey. This is the movie
I was telling you about,

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:30.045
<i> The Shaggy DA</i>
with Dean Jones from 1976.

01:02:30.047 --> 01:02:31.680
It's got total parallels

01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:34.082
to what Tim's campaign
is doing right now.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.651
Like, if you watch it, it almost
feels like this campaign

01:02:36.653 --> 01:02:37.986
is a remake of this movie.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:41.356
Um, and it's out of print
on VHS, so I went ahead

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:44.292
and dubbed a copy and then
glued this thing over it

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:46.428
because you won't really
get this anywhere.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.363
It's not on eBay or anywhere.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.365
So, take a look
and see what you think.

01:02:50.367 --> 01:02:52.868
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.070
Thank you all for coming.

01:02:55.706 --> 01:02:58.073
Josh:

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.775
- What are you talking about?
- Josh: Gregg.

01:02:59.777 --> 01:03:02.310
Here's here
at the town hall.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:04.613
(crowd applauding)

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:07.883
- He's in the room right here?
- Josh: Yeah.

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:12.087
- Fuck.
<i> - ¶ Well I'm looking</i>
<i> At the world now ¶</i>

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:14.289
<i> ¶ And it's going insane ¶</i>

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:19.895

01:03:19.897 --> 01:03:21.496

<i> ¶ But I know just who I am</i>
<i> How strong I can be ¶</i>

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:27.969

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.317
Thanks, guys, for coming out.
This is gonna be a good time.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.419
(clears throat) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.421
for being here. This is, uh...

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.690
Well, we're gonna do things
a little differently.

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:49.891
I see you, by the way.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:52.027
I see that you've decided
to show up,

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:54.563
and it's not...
you're not gonna ruin my night.

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:55.397
Gregg:

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:58.667
Well, save your questions
for the Q&A portion.

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:02.704
Um, I played this song here
that I wrote a few years ago.

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:04.105
How many people feel
that way lately,

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:06.975
it feels like the values,
the thing...

01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:11.413
"The way things used to be
ain't that way no more"

01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:12.514
is another expression.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:15.984
And, uh, for some,
for people like you, it's...

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:19.287
it's a good opportunity...
(clears throat)

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:23.658
...but for the original
San Bernardino people...

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.327
of the '50s and '60s,

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:27.929
life has not... is getting
a little weird, isn't it?

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:31.733
Anyways, what else did I want
to say about that?

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:33.568
Demographics.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:38.139
Um, imagine if you had
a candidate who stripped...

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:43.411
who promised on the day one that
we would be eliminating crime.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:45.046
How many people would vote
for that candidate?

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:48.183
And we're talking 100 percent
elimination of crime.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:51.119
That's what my candidacy
will deliver as DA.

01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:52.287
My name is Tim Heidecker.

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:55.657
I'm a businessman,
a legal expert, an entrepreneur.

01:04:55.659 --> 01:05:01.029
I've got several years
of experience in this area.

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.064
And I'm a proven leader.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:06.701
I ran a small business here
in the county,

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.904
in Victorville, the...

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:12.073
the Victorville Film Archive
Film Center.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.675
- You didn't run it.
- Tim: Excuse me?

01:05:13.677 --> 01:05:15.777
- You didn't run it.
- Tim: I did run it, actually.

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:16.978
- No. I ran it.
- Actually,

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.446
this is not a Q&A period
of the show, sir,

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:21.082
so if you wouldn't mind
taking your hat off.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:22.117
That's strike two.

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:24.719
And I won't be taking questions
from you, either.

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:26.788
I apologize. He's an instigator.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:31.026
And how many people
have had trouble with Roset...

01:05:31.028 --> 01:05:32.227
with Victor Ros... I'm sorry.

01:05:32.229 --> 01:05:34.763
That should be
"Vincent Rosetti."

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:37.666
Toni.

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:40.135
But the question is,
where is Rosetti? Where is he?

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:43.872
Where is... What...
He's hiding in some rat hole.

01:05:43.874 --> 01:05:48.443
He does not want to come
and face me in the arena.

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.315
Okay?

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:54.482
We have a rat problem.

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:57.719
- (cell phone dings)
- We got to ch...
set the rat trap!

01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:01.623
And I'm the exterminator.
You know?

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:04.359
So, we're trying
to get that going.

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:06.294
We have a rat problem.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.629
And that would be great
if everybody

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.264
was joining in on that.

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:12.000
We have a rat problem.

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:14.202
We have a rat problem.

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.338
- woman: We have a rat problem.
- We have a rat problem.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.007
And it's Rosetti the Rat.
He's corrupt.

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.475
And I actually have
some experience,

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.477
interestingly enough,
of dealing with corruption.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.080
I wrote and produced
and directed and starred in

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:28.383
the great <i> Decker</i> TV show,
currently on hiatus.

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:32.954
And had an interesting character
that some of you guys

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:36.024
probably remember,
President Jason Davidson,

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:39.094
one of the most
corrupt politicians in history,

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:41.429
if you could believe that.
Production always said

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.565
how well <i> Decker</i> actually dealt

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:47.535
with the whole
corruption concept.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:48.703
So I'm way ahead of that,

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:54.175
and we're having a good time
figuring out. So, uh...

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:55.643
you put your hat back on.

01:06:55.645 --> 01:06:59.047
Can you take your hat off
if you're gonna be inside?

01:06:59.049 --> 01:07:03.084
Thank you. Medicaid fraud...
we have that in the news lately.

01:07:03.086 --> 01:07:06.187
I don't know if you've seen
this Medicaid fraud.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:09.691
We have people taking advantage
of the system.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.261
There's people out there
who are basically vegetables,

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.430
who are brain-dead
and who have not...

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:16.564
can't feed themselves.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.833
And then you have people who are
taking advantage of those people

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:21.136
and taking a paycheck
from that experience.

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:24.472
And that's something
I'm gonna be fighting for,

01:07:24.474 --> 01:07:25.774
so watch...

01:07:25.776 --> 01:07:27.776
- watch out for that.
- Gregg: You're the one
that put them

01:07:27.778 --> 01:07:29.711
- in that position
in the first place...
- Tim: Excuse me?

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:31.579
...by depriving oxygen
with a scuba tank

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.348
- that didn't work.
- Tim: Now, we're not getting

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.251
into the details of that case.
That's a very sensitive case.

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:39.854
And, anyways, we are, uh,
gonna open it up to the floor,

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:43.725
if anybody has any questions.
It is a town hall event.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:46.261
- Gregg: I have a question.
Why did you...
- Tim: No. I'm sorry.

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:47.896
We're not taking questions
from you.

01:07:47.898 --> 01:07:48.930
If you're wearing a hat,

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:50.432
you will not be allowed
to ask a question.

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:52.033
- Why did you say that...
- Tim: Ma'am... Shut up.

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:54.135
Now ask your question.
You may ask a question.

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:55.970
- Indidi: Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening to you.

01:07:55.972 --> 01:07:57.572
- So, you mentioned...
- What's your name, by the way?

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.174
- I didn't get...
- My name is Indidi.

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:00.975
- Indidi. Indeedy, we sh...
- Yes.

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:04.312
Uh, Indidi, indeedy,
it's nice to see you.

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:06.181
- Nice to see you, too. Yes.
- Indidi.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:08.249
So, you mentioned
how it's your pledge

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.685
to erase crime in the community.

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:12.087
How would you make sure
that defendants

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:14.422
still get a fair trial
while accomplishing your goal

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.990
of eliminating crime
in our communities?

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:18.426
Terrific question. Thank you
for asking that question.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:22.897
It's really nice to get
that kind of brain here,

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.066
that kind of thinking,
which you...

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:27.969
you excel in, frankly.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.537
Um...

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:31.538
you know, a little personal,

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:35.210
but I was wrongly accused
of a crime myself.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:37.712
So, that's one of the reasons
I'm running, actually,

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:40.148
Indidi, indeedy,
is why I'm running.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.450
Um, yes, indeedy,
that is why I'm running.

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:44.618
Uh, represented myself
in court...

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:48.256
and successfully, I might add,
where I was convict...

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:49.290
I was not convicted.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.426
I was accused of something,
but I did...

01:08:52.429 --> 01:08:54.129
- Mass murder.
- Excuse me?

01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:56.764
Mass murder,
killing 19 people.

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:59.868
It doesn't matter
what I was accused of.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.836
What matters is the truth.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:05.273
The truth is, the court
of San Bernardino

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.374
found me not guilty,

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:11.979
despite the worst best efforts
of Rosetti and his squad of rats

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:14.048
and pigs.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:18.819
So, my point is,
to get to your question,

01:09:19.089 --> 01:09:21.456
I will be fighting
for the innocent.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.292
Now, if you commit a crime
on my watch...

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:27.662
you're going to jail
forever, right?

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.231
No more three strikes,
you're out. You're done.

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:32.834
That's the community
we want to create.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.836
But if you're innocent,
let's let...

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.037
let's let you be innocent.

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:39.407
Let's not put the courts...
Let's not put you under the...

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:42.877
the heel of just...
of corrupt justice.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:44.546
- Tim: Anybody else?
- Why did you say that you...

01:09:44.548 --> 01:09:46.113
- I didn't call on you.
- I just want to know

01:09:46.116 --> 01:09:48.850
why you said that you were
a small business owner

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:51.586
and ran the VFA
when you didn't run the VFA.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:54.022
- You burned the VFA down.
- I did not burn...

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:55.256
See, that's false accusations.

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:57.025
This is what got me into trouble
in the first place.

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:59.127
- Two times you burned down
the film archive.
- No, that's not true.

01:09:59.129 --> 01:10:01.095
That's off-limits,
as a subject goes, today.

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:04.065
Gregg: Well, if you're running
for a District Attorney job,

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:05.567
people should know
that you're an arsonist.

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.902
I'm not an... How dare you,
calling me an arsonist?

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:09.204
That's illegal,
what you're doing.

01:10:09.206 --> 01:10:10.605
- You're...
- You had ownership

01:10:10.607 --> 01:10:14.008
in the film theater,
the Victorville Film Center,

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.476
but that's different
than the archive,

01:10:15.478 --> 01:10:16.878
- which I ran.
- Tim: That's not...

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.413
- I ran the archive.
- That is irrelevant

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.114
- to this situation.
- Gregg: I ran both of them.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:22.150
- Excuse me.
- Gregg: I ran both
the film center

01:10:22.152 --> 01:10:23.218
and the film archive,

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:24.786
but you burned down
the film archive.

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:25.853
You didn't run that.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:27.889
So don't tell these people
you have a small business

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:29.524
in Victorville
because you never did.

01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:31.426
That business didn't...
wouldn't exist without me...

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:32.894
- Gregg: You can't even name...
- ...actually.

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.963
...three movies
that came out in the 1980s.

01:10:34.965 --> 01:10:37.332
I'm not running for mayor
of Movie Town.

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:39.300
I'm running
for District Attorney.

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:41.336
You're delusional.
This guy, by the way,

01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:45.373
is, like, obsessed
with collecting old videotapes.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.808
Nobody even watches videotapes
anymore.

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:49.210
Gregg: Yeah, they do.
A lot of people have both.

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:52.080
Do you have a DVD player
or a di...

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:54.449
- what is it? The VHS player?
- DVD.

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:56.918
What do you got, DVD?
You guys a couple?

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.753
You didn't run the film archive,
is my point,

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.488
'cause you don't know
anything about movies,

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.023
so you couldn't have
run a film archive.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:05.093
What do you... what do you care?
Why are you here?

01:11:05.095 --> 01:11:06.894
- You're here to ruin me.
- Gregg: I'm here

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:08.329
because I needed to give
something to

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:10.198
- your cameraman...
- Shame on you.
This guy is a pig.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.433
He's coming... He's driven
in here from Hollywood...

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.402
- He's driven in here
from Hollywood...
- Gregg: So did you.

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:16.170
- to disrupt the process.
- You don't live here.

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.905
Tim: Huh? I do live here.
I live right here

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:20.108
- in this building.
I am a resident of the...
- Just 'cause you rented

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:21.976
- a hotel room for a night...
- Tim: I'm a resident of...

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:24.712
This is a work-home environment.
And I have my mail coming...

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:26.914
How do I have my fucking mail
coming here...

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:28.916
How do I have
my fucking mail coming here...

01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:31.319
- Gregg: You could get P.O. box.
- ...if it's not where I live?

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:35.923
- Rosetti owns a house.
- Stay out of this process.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:38.793
That's my message.
So, I'm sorry.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:42.964
I apologize for the use
of the "F" word and, uh...

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.966
Yes. Thank you.

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:48.469
I asked him to go,
and he didn't listen.

01:11:48.672 --> 01:11:49.971
Fuck!

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.206
- Tim!
- I'm sorry!

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.876
I'm looking at you
the whole fucking way!

01:11:54.878 --> 01:11:56.644
Why don't you ask him
to get security...

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.447
- get somebody
to get fucking security?
- Tim, calm down! Calm down!

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:01.416
- Fuck this!
- Toni: You can't use that word!

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:04.118
I just wanted to get that
videotape back on the weekend,

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.620
so I'll be in touch
with you guys.

01:12:05.622 --> 01:12:09.057
But go ahead and watch it
and then see what you think,

01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:11.626
and I'll get it on the weekend.

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.294
Okay. Thanks.

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:14.662
Rewind it.

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:18.933
Toni: So sorry, everybody,
for his outburst.

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:21.302
He's been under a lot of stress.

01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:24.439
(indistinct chatter)

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:27.008
I'm sorry, everybody.
Thanks. I appreciate it.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.444
You don't understand.
I'm a very passionate guy.

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:30.945
I'm passionate for you guys.

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:32.814
And it's been a lot of...
been a long time...

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:37.051
it's been a long, um,
couple of days, okay?

01:12:37.253 --> 01:12:39.387
I am so sorry. (sniffles)

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:41.556
Thank you.

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:42.790
- Can we take some food?
- Yeah.

01:12:42.792 --> 01:12:44.225
- Toni: Absolutely.
- Tim: Help yourself.

01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:45.860
Toni: Please, help yourself.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.266
Thank you, guys.

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:58.239
We'll get them in...
We'll get out tomorrow

01:12:58.241 --> 01:13:01.776
and get down there
and just get out there.

01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:03.411
I mean, there's not a lot
of people there,

01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:05.146
so it doesn't matter.
It's not like they're gonna...

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:06.614
If it was bad,
it would be 1000 people.

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.117
- It'd be everybody
talking about...
- (watch chimes)

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:13.121
You guys are gonna need to take
a piss break or something.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:15.156
I got to be alone.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:24.365
Gregg: Oh, it's like,
I told you guys that Tim's nuts.

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:26.033
Josh: Gregg, can you take
your hat off for a second?

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.169
- Just the lights.
- Do I need to?

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:30.605
Josh: It's just casting a shadow
on your face.

01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:33.808
He goes in there, and he starts
dropping the VFA name

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.476
to try to win voters over.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:37.311
And it's not really fair
to movie buffs

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:39.280
that might think
they should vote for him

01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:41.315
that he has something to do
with that archive,

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:42.817
other than having
caught it on fire.

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:47.255
I told you that he was nuts
and you were wasting your time,

01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:48.322
and you didn't listen.

01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:49.757
And now you're still
wasting your time

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:51.325
'cause you want to talk
about him more.

01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:53.361
What you should talk about
is the movies.

01:13:53.363 --> 01:13:56.364
But you guys don't seem
too interested,

01:13:56.366 --> 01:13:58.499
so best of luck to you.

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:12.814
Tim: <i> All right, well, is there</i>
<i> anybody else I can speak with?</i>

01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:14.348
<i> Because...</i>
<i> You know what I mean?</i>

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:18.753
Like, is there anybody above you
I can speak with?

01:14:18.755 --> 01:14:20.621
'Cause this seems like...

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:26.561
If they're printed already,
is there not a way

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:28.529
to hold the elect...

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:31.466
I don't know, stop...
like, delay the election

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:32.900
until we can fix the mistake?

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:36.003
Because... So,
what are you telling me?

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:38.673
That I have to, what?

01:14:38.675 --> 01:14:42.109
That they... Can they write
my name in at this point?

01:14:43.046 --> 01:14:45.446
If I'm not on the ballot,
how am I supposed to compete

01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.815
if those two other fuckers
are on the ba...

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:48.749
No. I apologize.

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:52.053
If those two guys
are on the ballot, right?

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:55.756
So, you're...
This whole thing... You're...

01:14:55.758 --> 01:14:58.292
This board of elections
in San Bernardino County...

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:00.561
I know.
You've won this round, I guess,

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:03.264
but I'm gonna get the word out
starting tonight.

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:05.366
We're gonna start
making phone calls.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:09.737
Well, that's a little...
too little... little too late.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:11.272
We're a little past that.

01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:12.874
And if you guys would have been
more cooperative

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:17.712
from the beginning and...
then we wouldn't be here.

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:21.549
So, tell your boss
to go fuck himself.

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:24.886
Hello? Yeah.

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:27.188
- Great.
- Oh, Tim.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.991
Tim: You know, it's blank!
(sighs)

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:34.595
(inhales)

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:35.997
Tim.

01:15:37.433 --> 01:15:39.033
Okay, we're not on the ballot.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:44.705
We are a write-in candidacy.
It's an insurgency candidacy.

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:48.476
And that's the news.

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:50.711
So, I'm gonna get some ice.

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:54.782
- (thuds)
- Tim! Jesus Christ.

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:57.885
- (scoffs)
- (door opens)

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:04.358
(Tim sighs)

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.676
Oh, my God.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:26.080
- (pounds on door)
- Tim: Toni?

01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:29.016
- Toni: Tim? Tim?
- Hey, I'm sorry.

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.384
Toni: You have to calm down,
Tim.

01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:32.286
- I'm calm. I'm sorry.
- Toni: Calm down.

01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:35.890
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Stop throwing things.

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:39.627
I didn't... I just threw a beer.
I'm not being violent.

01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:41.228
(Tim sighs)

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:44.098
Toni: I... I...

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:49.136
I don't even know what to say
to any of this at this point.

01:16:50.173 --> 01:16:51.038
Tim: Yeah.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.975
Well, I need a little bit
of space right now.

01:16:53.977 --> 01:16:56.010
So why don't you, um...

01:16:56.212 --> 01:16:57.678
why don't you give me that
right now?

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.514
I think I just need...
I need a little bit of...

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.284
I need a little bit
of space, so...

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:06.520
Do you want to just give me
a little bit of that?

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.089
Of course.

01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:11.292
Yeah.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:15.262
(Toni sighs)

01:17:35.251 --> 01:17:36.917
(door closes)

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:46.360
- (sofa squeaks)
- (sighs)

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:50.364
(burps, sighs)

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:56.303
(munching)

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:32.573
man:
<i> ...Beginning to get results</i>
<i> trickling in</i>

01:18:32.575 --> 01:18:35.776

<i> over the next few hours.</i>

<i> We will keep you up-to-date</i>

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:45.519

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:56.931
reporter: <i> And just a quick</i>
<i> update on some local races.</i>

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:07.975

01:19:07.977 --> 01:19:10.177

<i> ...Reporter Jay Shay-Sibesta</i>

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:21.956

<i> ...and will be giving you</i>

01:19:25.928 --> 01:19:30.698

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:35.136
- Call Rosetti... Call...
- (watch dings)

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:38.706
(inhales)

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.643
Tim: <i> I need to...</i>
<i> Can you connect me</i>

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:46.180
<i> to the DA office</i>
<i> in Can Bernardino office?</i>

01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:50.084
Hello. Is it Vincent?
It's Tim Heidecker...

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:55.356
calling to concede to you
for winning election...

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:56.757
the election...

01:19:57.794 --> 01:20:00.394
and wish you congra...
wish you luck.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:04.165
And it was a good, hard race.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.233
And you won.

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:10.171
I know that you were behind
many of the tricks

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:13.040
that you screwed me
with getting...

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:18.145
shutting my... shutting down
the press and everything else.

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.580
And, uh...

01:20:19.582 --> 01:20:22.349
uh... you uh...

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:24.285
you suck, you know?

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:28.255
And you...
you had the easiest case ever

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:31.826
in the history of courts
against me,

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:34.461
and you had the smoking gun,

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:36.030
and you couldn't even
close that.

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:39.266
So, just... You got to sleep
with that shit.

01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:43.737
And I'm gonna get you
next election cycle.

01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:44.738
(phone clicks)

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:49.176
We're living in a culture
that is more and more about...

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:55.816
what's glittery,
style over substance.

01:20:55.818 --> 01:20:59.286
And Mr. Heidecker brought that
into the courtroom.

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:03.224
We don't value substance.
We don't value character.

01:21:03.226 --> 01:21:05.526
I mean,
Mr. Heidecker's character,

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:07.528
as far as I'm concerned, is nil.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.064
There is no character there.

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:12.066
I lost my heart...

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:16.070
for the courtroom after that.

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:18.105
<i> Once you lose that</i>
<i> sense of purpose...</i>

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:20.908
<i> I don't care</i>
<i> what profession you're in...</i>

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.177
<i> it's time to move on.</i>

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.848
Tim: So, this is, uh...

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:31.085
this is it. This is the spot.

01:21:31.187 --> 01:21:33.520
It's the site
of the Electric Sun, uh,

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:35.456
20 music festival...

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:39.560
that they've condemned,
but you can sneak in here.

01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:46.000
I haven't really been back here
since that night.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:50.938
This place was a...
was just filled with bodies.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.106
That's, like, my last memory

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:54.174
'cause I was kind of
buzzed myself.

01:21:54.176 --> 01:21:57.845
So I was seeing, sort of,
flashes of...

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:01.782
sick kids and, you know...

01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:04.685
I don't know how much
you want to talk about that.

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:06.086
(sighs)

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:09.290
You know, shit happens.

01:22:14.864 --> 01:22:17.031
It was, you know,
one of those bittersweet things

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:21.101
because it... it was such
a horrible, tragic event

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.636
<i> that we would take back</i>
<i> in a minute,</i>

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:25.339
<i> but at the same time,</i>
<i> it got me to this place</i>

01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:26.974
<i> where I was able to come out</i>

01:22:26.976 --> 01:22:29.209
<i> and get in the ring,</i>
<i> get in the arena.</i>

01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:33.614
<i> And, um, as much as I lost,</i>
<i> you know, and didn't...</i>

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:35.749
<i> didn't win,</i>
<i> that's the risk I took.</i>

01:22:35.751 --> 01:22:39.687
<i> And that is not something</i>
<i> I would ever change.</i>

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:41.755
<i> I wouldn't change a thing.</i>

01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:45.759
If they're doing...
they would have counted the...

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:49.063
the absentee ballots
and everything like that, right,

01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:52.299
like, the provisional
ballots and... Yeah.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.034
<i> I fought fair,</i>
<i> I fought honestly,</i>

01:22:54.036 --> 01:23:00.908
and you know, I should probably
give Rosetti a concession call.

01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:01.976
(sniffles) Um...

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:05.679
You know? I guess that's the...
the right thing to do, which...

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:07.548
You know, I should have done
that last night.

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:10.050
I'm gonna do something,
and you can film it or not.

01:23:10.052 --> 01:23:14.221
I don't care.
I just... saw this.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:24.098
This is for the Electric Sun 19,

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:31.071
who accidentally overdosed
on medicine that was...

01:23:31.073 --> 01:23:34.041
that was tainted
by the Chinese government.

01:23:34.043 --> 01:23:36.910
And, uh, I'm sorry that I...

01:23:36.912 --> 01:23:41.415
that I was in any way connected
with it and that I was a...

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:44.284
a bystander
to the massacre here.

01:23:44.453 --> 01:23:45.853
And forever we...

01:23:45.855 --> 01:23:49.323
we know that you guys
are looking down on us, and...

01:23:51.394 --> 01:23:54.561
you know, we wish you were
with us today.

01:23:54.964 --> 01:23:57.564
Let me put that here.

01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:06.974
Does this work if I stand it up?

01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:18.285
How's this look?
Can you get this and...

01:24:18.487 --> 01:24:20.454
Can you get the flowers,

01:24:20.456 --> 01:24:24.858
if you rake up from flowers
to me, mountains, sky?

01:24:26.662 --> 01:24:29.596
That's your.. probably
your end shot, right?

01:24:29.598 --> 01:24:30.764
Dedicated... Something with text

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:33.967
dedicated to the memory
of the Electric Sun 19?

01:24:36.605 --> 01:24:38.238
Something like that?

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:42.309
Yup. Okay, cool. Great.
We got it? Cool.

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:44.344
I think that'll play nice
as your ending.

01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:47.481
I don't want to tell you
what to do, but if you can

01:24:47.483 --> 01:24:48.549
just send me a rough cut

01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:51.151
and I'll give you notes, um,
that would be great.

01:24:51.153 --> 01:24:52.719
I think you guys did
a great job.

01:24:52.721 --> 01:24:55.122
From what I could see,
everything looked great.

01:24:55.124 --> 01:24:56.857
I wish you would have gotten
a version where I won.

01:24:56.859 --> 01:24:58.926
That would have made,
probably, a more interesting

01:24:58.928 --> 01:24:59.960
documentary for you.

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:02.196
But maybe next time
you can follow me around

01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:03.297
on my next adventure,

01:25:03.299 --> 01:25:06.834
"Whale Man," or whatever it is,
run for governor.

01:25:06.836 --> 01:25:10.938
- (watch chimes)
- Tim: Ah! That's Toni.

01:25:11.006 --> 01:25:14.074
Okay, I got to call her.
She wants to talk.

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:15.943
But that's just sort of me
and her,

01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:19.580
so that's a wrap on this,
I believe, don't you think?

01:25:20.182 --> 01:25:21.915
- Josh: Yep.
- Tim: Okay.

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:26.053
And don't use any of that shit
with Gregg, you know...

01:25:26.055 --> 01:25:28.989
or the stuff
in the hotel room with the...

01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:33.660
Just keep it... Keep it
sort of positive, I think.

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:35.929
Good luck.
