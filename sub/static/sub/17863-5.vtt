And yet it feels
so right.

19:44.622 --> 19:47.557
Why must I be
a homosexual?

19:47.559 --> 19:49.092
Why?!

19:49.094 --> 19:50.760
Ugh!

19:53.530 --> 19:56.265
(dr. Freud)
what is going on in here?

19:56.267 --> 19:57.200
Nothing!

19:57.202 --> 19:59.335
Frederick, look at you.

19:59.337 --> 19:59.969
You are cured.

19:59.971 --> 20:04.107
The masculinity training
must have done the trick.

20:04.109 --> 20:07.577
I officially declare you
a non-homosexual.

20:07.579 --> 20:10.413
Oh, frederick,
I'm so proud of you.

20:10.415 --> 20:11.814
You're not concerned at all
with the fact

20:11.816 --> 20:13.349
That I'm having sex
with my sister?

20:13.351 --> 20:15.818
Seems perfectly natural
to me.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.754
Carry on.

20:23.427 --> 20:25.461
There comes a time
in every man's life

20:25.463 --> 20:27.463
When he must choose
between doing

20:27.465 --> 20:28.865
What his mother
wants him to do

20:28.867 --> 20:31.634
And what his sister
wants him to do.

20:31.636 --> 20:34.737
And I've realized
that my country needs me

20:34.739 --> 20:37.406
In washington, b.C.

20:37.408 --> 20:39.709
Yes, let's go.

(hortense)
what is going on in here?

21:12.710 --> 21:13.643
What are you doing?

21:13.645 --> 21:14.710
What the hell was that?

21:14.712 --> 21:15.778
What the hell was that?

21:15.780 --> 21:16.679
What is happening?

21:16.681 --> 21:18.581
What? What is it?
What do you want?

21:18.583 --> 21:19.482
What is this?

21:19.484 --> 21:21.551
What is this, baltimore?
