00:00.811 --> 00:05.381
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:05.448 --> 00:07.449
The current is really strong.

00:07.584 --> 00:10.419
It's bubble, bubble, toil and trouble...

00:10.487 --> 00:12.723
Like riding a bucking bronco.

00:12.891 --> 00:15.391
...as the guys test a fizzy fable

00:15.459 --> 00:18.426
that it's impossible to stay
afloat in bubbly water.

00:19.129 --> 00:20.963
You're just not trying hard enough.

00:21.031 --> 00:22.264
That's more like it!
Yeah, baby!

00:22.332 --> 00:25.901
But, will it be a case of sink or swim?

00:25.969 --> 00:27.403
Swim harder.

00:27.504 --> 00:30.409
Meantime, Kari, Tory and Grant
take aim at a myth

00:31.350 --> 00:33.350
that's got them quiver with anticipation.

00:33.376 --> 00:34.710
Okay, it's lit!

00:34.778 --> 00:36.814
Can an exploding arrow

00:36.882 --> 00:39.383
cleave a mighty pine tree in two?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.384
With precision explosives

00:42.452 --> 00:44.453
and the mother of all pine trees,

00:44.521 --> 00:45.821
it's time to split.

00:45.889 --> 00:47.089
I'm so ready!

00:47.157 --> 00:47.990
Here we go.

00:48.058 --> 00:53.596
Three, two, one!

00:53.663 --> 00:56.166
Who are the MythBusters?

00:56.268 --> 00:57.701
Adam Savage...

00:57.702 --> 00:59.343
That's the spirit, soldiers!

00:59.369 --> 01:00.836
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:00.904 --> 01:02.004
I'll be darned.

01:02.072 --> 01:04.473
Between them, more than 30 years

01:04.474 --> 01:06.711
of special effects experience.

01:08.279 --> 01:10.279
Joining them, Kari Byron...

01:10.865 --> 01:12.065
That is messed up!...

01:12.366 --> 01:13.565
...Grant Imahara...

01:13.566 --> 01:15.090
Start the car!

01:15.091 --> 01:16.559
...and Tory Belleci.

01:16.584 --> 01:17.984
This time is car up!

01:18.209 --> 01:20.509
They don't just tell the myths...

01:20.634 --> 01:22.934
...they put them to the test!

01:35.678 --> 01:36.344
Hangover?

01:36.412 --> 01:37.078
No.

01:37.146 --> 01:39.447
I'm setting up a demo for our next story.

01:39.515 --> 01:40.115
Which is?

01:40.182 --> 01:41.616
There is a myth going around

01:41.684 --> 01:43.952
that it is impossible
to swim in bubbly water.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.559
Whether it's antacid
tablets, or carbonated,

01:46.584 --> 01:49.484
as long as there's bubbles in the water,
you won't be able to swim.

01:49.509 --> 01:50.309
Really?

01:50.334 --> 01:51.726
Yeah, the conventional
wisdom is that the bubbles

01:51.727 --> 01:53.628
make the water overall less dense,

01:53.630 --> 01:55.731
and so, while you would float
in the non-bubbly water,

01:55.798 --> 01:56.832
when you get to the bubble part,

01:56.899 --> 01:58.334
you would sink like a stone.

01:58.436 --> 02:00.137
Sound like we're going for a swim.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.104
I think so.

02:02.805 --> 02:04.239
According to the myth,

02:04.473 --> 02:06.676
when water is filled with fizz,

02:06.677 --> 02:08.610
you supposedly sink without trace.

02:09.512 --> 02:12.712
But, does the density
difference of bubbly water

02:12.915 --> 02:15.951
really mean that swimming
in it is impossible?

02:17.118 --> 02:20.421
Well, since we used up all our
antacid breaking out of jail...

02:21.657 --> 02:24.791
...what say we start with something
small, like a fish tank,

02:24.794 --> 02:27.095
and make a bunch of bubbles
in it, see what happens.

02:27.097 --> 02:28.263
Sounds good. Let's do it.

02:29.498 --> 02:32.332
The myth is that it is impossible
to swim in bubbly water

02:32.335 --> 02:34.202
because the aerated water is supposed to be

02:34.237 --> 02:36.104
less dense than regular water.

02:36.172 --> 02:38.072
Are you ready for some experimenting?

02:38.074 --> 02:39.740
I don't think so.

02:39.908 --> 02:43.043
So I'm about to conduct
some scale experiments

02:43.045 --> 02:45.982
to see if there is a change
in density of water

02:46.018 --> 02:48.554
when I run a crackload
of bubbles through it.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074

02:58.828 --> 03:00.128
All right, let's try that again.

03:00.396 --> 03:02.498
It's a great place to start.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.668
Adam and his 2-D "mini me"

03:04.670 --> 03:07.070
will test the science
at the heart of this myth.

03:08.738 --> 03:11.571
Do bubbles make a difference
to the density of water?

03:12.441 --> 03:15.046
What I've made here is a crude hydrometer.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.571
It's actually floating at
a very specific depth,

03:17.596 --> 03:18.613
depending on the density of the water.

03:18.714 --> 03:20.681
If I increase the density of this fish tank

03:20.749 --> 03:23.150
with, say, salt, he would
float a little higher.

03:23.419 --> 03:25.186
If I decrease the density

03:25.254 --> 03:27.788
with, let's say, air bubbles,
he'd float a little lower.

03:27.890 --> 03:29.491
Now, if this myth is is true,

03:29.558 --> 03:32.127
and I put a whole bunch of
air bubbles underneath this guy,

03:32.194 --> 03:33.830
little Adam there is gonna drown.

03:33.831 --> 03:36.733
So, now that 2-D "mini me"
is neutrally bouyant,

03:36.801 --> 03:40.169
it's time to see if he'll sink
like the myth suggests.

03:40.337 --> 03:43.277
Three, two, one.

03:49.645 --> 03:50.612
Someone is happy.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.147
But aside from putting a smile

03:52.215 --> 03:54.983
on Adam's dial, what are the results?

03:55.784 --> 03:57.885
I'm seeing almost no change at all

03:57.953 --> 03:59.755
in the hydrometer's level.

04:00.322 --> 04:02.257
If anything, it's actually
rising a little bit.

04:02.324 --> 04:04.492
And I must admit, I had
a little bias going into this.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.295
I thought that as soon as
I turned on the bubbles,

04:06.363 --> 04:09.531
that hydrometer was gonna
drop below the surface.

04:09.599 --> 04:12.266
I'm fully in camp of
"the bubbles lower the density",

04:12.302 --> 04:14.570
but there's something else going on here.

04:14.738 --> 04:16.039
At any rate, in a small scale test,

04:16.106 --> 04:17.740
it is not looking very good for this myth.

04:17.807 --> 04:21.308
A conviction only confirmed
after Jamie gets a demo.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.878
So I see you're fixing to dump
water all over my floor.

04:24.214 --> 04:26.715
No, no, I'm containing it
in this lovely tank.

04:27.151 --> 04:28.784
So, what do you think is gonna happen?

04:28.885 --> 04:29.952
I think it's gonna sink.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.289
Check this out.

04:34.557 --> 04:36.291
It's not sinking.

04:36.358 --> 04:38.058
Not at all, not even a little bit.

04:38.094 --> 04:40.228
If anything, it rises up
a fraction of an inch.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.264
You would think that the increased
amount of air in the water

04:43.333 --> 04:45.201
would make it less dense, so it would sink,

04:45.235 --> 04:47.870
but that seems to be
counteracted, and then some,

04:47.938 --> 04:51.039
by the upwelling current of the
movement of those bubbles.

04:52.108 --> 04:54.242
Not looking very good for
the story at this point.

04:54.310 --> 04:55.177
No.

04:55.544 --> 04:58.182
Far from sinking,
the hydrometer rose slightly,

04:58.207 --> 05:00.507
but it's too early to call this myth yet.

05:00.583 --> 05:04.223
After all, you can't test a
swimming saga without getting wet.

05:08.190 --> 05:11.392
Next up, a myth that's
going to blow you away.

05:12.428 --> 05:14.228
All right., so this myth
comes from a viewer.

05:14.296 --> 05:17.666
A guy in Iowa wrote in and said
that his uncle used to take

05:17.667 --> 05:20.537
a bow and arrow, strap a
stick of dynamite to it,

05:20.562 --> 05:22.162
light it, fire into a tree,

05:22.204 --> 05:24.973
and when it would explode, it
would split the tree up the middle.

05:25.041 --> 05:26.680
Okay, are you sure this is a viewer myth

05:26.705 --> 05:28.705
and not like a Tori Belleci family history?

05:28.905 --> 05:30.405
No, I'm serious! He wrote it in!

05:30.448 --> 05:31.881
Wery well, I'm willing to try it.

05:31.949 --> 05:34.918
Sounds like we need a stick of
dynamite, an arrow, and a tree.

05:36.686 --> 05:40.189
As any William Tell fan will,
err, "Tell" you, the trick

05:40.256 --> 05:43.562
of splitting an apple
with an arrow is a blast.

05:46.629 --> 05:50.269
But according to this myth,
an arrow, coupled with dynamite,

05:50.294 --> 05:52.594
can split a much bigger apple.

05:52.636 --> 05:55.671
But is this fan fable bubble baloney?

05:57.774 --> 05:59.775
Okay, for this experiment
I think we need to just go for it.

06:00.242 --> 06:02.378
Get the biggest log we can
find and just anchor it

06:02.403 --> 06:03.603
to the ground at the bomb range.

06:03.646 --> 06:07.048
Remember, we're trying to split this
tree down the middle with explosives.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.153
We don't wanna just blow it into pieces.

06:09.178 --> 06:09.978
Right.

06:12.521 --> 06:18.026
Full scale testing means
finding the right tree.

06:18.093 --> 06:19.964
We're here at the bomb range to find out

06:19.989 --> 06:22.189
if our dynamite arrows can split a tree.

06:22.932 --> 06:24.098
These are our trees.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.800
They're pine trees from a recycler.

06:25.935 --> 06:29.103
Now, they're 20 feet long
and almost 6,000 pounds.

06:29.171 --> 06:32.340
So the first step, dig a hole.

06:32.508 --> 06:36.845
The pine trees tech specs match
the viewer myth almost to the letter.

06:36.913 --> 06:39.082
All right, how's about right here?

06:39.916 --> 06:42.019
While Kari gets on with step one...

06:42.244 --> 06:44.044
So much better than a shovel.

06:44.087 --> 06:47.122
...getting to grips with the
pines' parameters is Grant.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.026
Now, we've chosen the pine tree

06:49.051 --> 06:51.251
because it's one of the most
common trees in America.

06:51.461 --> 06:54.429
In fact, there are over 35 varieties
in North America alone.

06:54.797 --> 06:58.933
But there are two reasons that might
make it easier to split down the middle.

06:59.268 --> 07:02.904
One, they have vascular bundles
that run the entire length of the tree.

07:02.972 --> 07:06.074
These are tiny tubes that carry
water and nutrients to the top.

07:06.342 --> 07:11.246
And two, it's got a spiral grain which
goes parallel to the axis of the tree.

07:11.313 --> 07:13.848
Those things together might
just help us get a split.

07:14.716 --> 07:15.850
That's the theory.

07:15.918 --> 07:18.222
And, with the target
tree now standing tall...

07:18.747 --> 07:20.747
That's what I call a real stick in the mud.

07:20.789 --> 07:23.825
...the guys turn their
attention to the weapon,

07:23.993 --> 07:28.129
setting up a remote bow and
arrow firing mechanism.

07:28.197 --> 07:33.401
So we need to fire a lit stick of dynamite
from a bow and arrow into a tree.

07:33.569 --> 07:35.403
Now, that is way too
dangerous for us to do.

07:35.471 --> 07:38.673
So, we brought out our remote
arrow firing mechanism.

07:38.940 --> 07:42.076
With the bow ready to go,
that just leaves the payload.

07:42.344 --> 07:43.845
We're not gonna use dynamite,

07:43.912 --> 07:46.049
cause, actually, it's a fairly
unstable substance.

07:46.117 --> 07:50.118
Instead, our experts Frank Doyle
and J.D. Nelson have given us... this.

07:50.686 --> 07:52.053
It's a binary explosive.

07:52.221 --> 07:55.756
It's a lot more stable, which means it
will go off when and where we want it to.

07:55.824 --> 08:00.228
And it has exactly the same amount
of energy as a stick of dynamite.

08:00.929 --> 08:07.001
After a quick test fire to make sure the
remote bow and arrow is on the money,

08:07.102 --> 08:09.236
it's time to take aim at this myth.

08:09.304 --> 08:12.774
It's time to load up our arrow firing
machine, shoot it into the tree,

08:13.142 --> 08:15.343
and see if it gets split down the middle.

08:15.410 --> 08:17.045
Do I think that's gonna happen?

08:17.112 --> 08:18.212
Sure. Absolutely.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.515
If we lived in a cartoon.

08:20.616 --> 08:25.821
"Wile E. Coyote" Kari has her doubts.
But there's only one way to find out.

08:27.222 --> 08:28.960
All right. So the dynamite's lit.

08:29.028 --> 08:30.930
Let's see if we can cleave this tree.

08:30.955 --> 08:32.554
Okay, this is dynamite arrow, take it!

08:32.563 --> 08:36.464
Here we go, in three, two, one...

08:37.432 --> 08:39.100
The arrow gets triggered.

08:39.168 --> 08:40.634
The fuse burns through.

08:41.501 --> 08:42.870
And then...

08:48.077 --> 08:50.211
And the tree still stands.

08:50.278 --> 08:52.181
That was a good blast.

08:54.549 --> 08:56.650
It sure was a hefty blast.

08:56.651 --> 09:00.488
But when the smoke clears, it's
clear it wasn't hefty enough.

09:00.522 --> 09:04.059
The tree appears to be
pretty well undamaged.

09:05.827 --> 09:06.461
All right,

09:06.528 --> 09:08.763
well, the tree is still in one piece.

09:08.831 --> 09:10.598
Yeah, I don't even see a crack.

09:10.865 --> 09:13.067
Well, maybe we need more explosives.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.637
Maybe this was more than
just like a stick of dynamite,

09:15.671 --> 09:17.705
maybe it was extra powerful dynamite.

09:17.873 --> 09:19.140
That is a great idea.

09:19.308 --> 09:24.245
After a surprisingly feeble first
test, the myth is already on thin ice.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.647
So it's time to up the ante.

09:27.115 --> 09:29.017
We're gonna double the amount of explosives

09:29.085 --> 09:31.286
that we're attaching
to the tip of the arrow.

09:31.354 --> 09:33.688
Same as before, we're gonna
light the fuse, remote fire it

09:33.756 --> 09:36.327
into the tree and see what happens.

09:36.828 --> 09:38.598
Later, on "MythBusters",

09:38.623 --> 09:41.423
splitting time with a super dynamite arrow.

09:41.632 --> 09:45.167
But next, bubble, bubble,
Adam's in trouble.

09:45.834 --> 09:46.868
Oh, the current is really strong.

09:54.375 --> 09:55.175
I don't know, man.

09:55.243 --> 09:56.844
It's not looking very good for this story.

09:56.912 --> 10:00.481
Our hydrometer didn't just
not sink in the water, it rose.

10:00.549 --> 10:02.052
Well, you know, sometimes things

10:02.077 --> 10:05.377
as basic as air and water
just doesn't scale that well.

10:05.419 --> 10:08.221
Let's say we bump it up
a notch and go larger.

10:08.289 --> 10:08.989
All right.

10:09.057 --> 10:11.625
Hey, you know irrigation tank
we used for whirlpool of death?

10:12.093 --> 10:15.330
What say we fill that full of water
and put a bubbler at the bottom of it?

10:15.398 --> 10:16.565
I think we've still got it.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.033
I think we do. Let's do it.

10:18.934 --> 10:21.735
Yeap, the small scale wasn't
particularly promising.

10:22.303 --> 10:23.570
It's not sinking.

10:23.671 --> 10:25.840
But the myth hasn't sunk just yet,

10:25.907 --> 10:29.543
and as Adam won't fit in that tank,
the team is upsizing everything.

10:30.011 --> 10:31.445
Starting with the bubble maker.

10:32.713 --> 10:36.850
So, this assembly of aquarium bubblers
worked pretty well for this... test,

10:36.917 --> 10:40.087
but if we're gonna do this in
a larger scale, I don't wanna

10:40.155 --> 10:42.388
have to do all the plumbing, and "You can buy

10:42.456 --> 10:44.825
a thousand of these
little aquarium thingies".

10:45.193 --> 10:47.763
I need to figure out
some more efficient way

10:47.788 --> 10:49.488
of creating lots of little bubbles.

10:49.530 --> 10:53.902
And the method is typically Jamiesque
in its practical simplicity.

10:54.170 --> 10:57.474
Compressed air, pumped
into a canvas pillow case,

10:57.499 --> 10:59.999
forcing thousands of tiny
bubbles through the fabric.

11:00.342 --> 11:02.009
Ah, that is very cool.

11:02.376 --> 11:03.676
Very cool indeed.

11:03.744 --> 11:06.651
With the proof of concept
pillow case bubbling away,

11:06.676 --> 11:08.276
Adam's on to the next task.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.576
Well, let's start figuring out
how to go full scale with this,

11:10.618 --> 11:12.520
cause I'm dying to get
in the water with this.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.989
If the myth is true, dying could be right.

11:15.857 --> 11:18.325
But Jamie doesn't seem
too bothered by the prospect.

11:18.792 --> 11:20.194
It's gonna be fun.

11:21.762 --> 11:24.798
But before the fun begins,
Jamie has to upscale

11:24.866 --> 11:28.603
his prototype into a heavy
duty working model.

11:30.838 --> 11:35.010
So, all we've done here is welded together
a couple of heavy steel frames,

11:35.178 --> 11:38.813
and we've sandwiched, inside the frames, our pillow case.

11:38.881 --> 11:41.582
We're pumping air into that pillow case,

11:41.650 --> 11:45.622
and as it pressurizes, it comes
through the weave of the fabric.

11:45.647 --> 11:46.547
That's great.

11:46.572 --> 11:47.972
It makes little bubbles.

11:47.989 --> 11:50.558
But not in the shop it won't.

11:51.125 --> 11:55.197
For that, they're heading for
some familiar queasy scenery.

11:58.465 --> 12:00.267
Brings back memories, don't it?

12:00.734 --> 12:02.102
Not very pleasant ones.

12:02.969 --> 12:06.441
Yep, the last time Adam took
a dip in the irrigation tank...

12:06.466 --> 12:07.466
Cut it!

12:07.966 --> 12:08.866
Well, that's great.

12:08.876 --> 12:11.210
...things did not go quite to plan.

12:11.478 --> 12:13.346
I'm done with science for today.

12:13.613 --> 12:16.416
We've done our small scale tests
and we've learned a thing or two,

12:16.483 --> 12:19.353
but if we're gonna find out if it's
possible to swim in fizzy water,

12:20.021 --> 12:22.456
we're gonna have to swim in fizzy water.

12:22.623 --> 12:26.493
We've come back out here to
Alameda to this 10,000 gallon tank

12:26.561 --> 12:28.762
that we installed a few years ago,

12:28.830 --> 12:33.266
and we're gonna put a larger bubbler in
there, and Adam's gonna go for a swim.

12:33.534 --> 12:34.835
Or not.

12:35.902 --> 12:37.470
Now comes the tricky bit.

12:37.538 --> 12:40.105
Getting the giant bubbler up and in.

12:40.873 --> 12:42.240
All right.

12:42.675 --> 12:44.613
Take it on up.

12:46.714 --> 12:49.483
So, our bubbler is just about
ready to be put in place.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.017
That's a tight fit.

12:51.085 --> 12:51.718
Okay, stop!

12:51.986 --> 12:54.321
What happens next is that
we hook up the air supply...

12:54.889 --> 12:57.558
Okay, go ahead and give it some air.

12:58.225 --> 12:58.992
Nice!

12:59.060 --> 13:00.727
And then we slowly lower it.

13:01.061 --> 13:05.365
The 20 feet to the bottom of
this tank, which is full of...

13:05.699 --> 13:07.667
reasonably clear but quite cold water.

13:07.735 --> 13:09.938
Then, I will put on some scuba gear,

13:09.963 --> 13:11.963
and then we're pretty much
ready to do this test,

13:12.006 --> 13:14.112
which I hope happens quickly,
because this water right now

13:14.137 --> 13:15.837
is about 50, 51 degrees.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.214
As plans go, it's pretty straightforward.

13:20.982 --> 13:24.251
I'm above ground, and yet
I'm going scuba diving.

13:24.318 --> 13:24.785
Bon voyage.

13:24.852 --> 13:26.853
All right.

13:28.288 --> 13:29.088
How is the water?

13:29.155 --> 13:31.291
The water is so cold, I
got an instant headache.

13:31.159 --> 13:32.359
But you know what's really cool in here?

13:32.426 --> 13:33.860
Looking out the portholes.

13:35.328 --> 13:38.899
But before Adam can unhook the bubbler,
it needs to be in the right position.

13:39.366 --> 13:40.099
Is that good enough?

13:40.267 --> 13:40.934
I think so.

13:41.001 --> 13:43.136
- Will you start to lower it very slowly?
- Will do.

13:43.204 --> 13:46.807
The aim is to get the bubbler
perfectly level, to have an even

13:46.874 --> 13:48.642
spread of bubbles at the surface.

13:49.209 --> 13:51.778
Fire up the generator, please.

13:52.446 --> 13:55.051
Slowly bring it up to the mark.

13:59.219 --> 14:04.492
As the rig roars into life, a perfect
hubbub of bubbles bursts forth.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.494
It's a gorgeous stream of bubbles.

14:06.562 --> 14:08.630
Can't wait to get into it.

14:08.631 --> 14:12.598
With their fully functioning rig
in the right position, what's next?

14:13.066 --> 14:16.403
This test is pretty much the same as
our small scale experiments, except...

14:16.771 --> 14:19.072
this time we're gonna have
a human hydrometer.

14:19.207 --> 14:20.240
Namely Adam.

14:20.607 --> 14:24.010
Now, we're going to try and weight
him, so he's neutrally buoyant,

14:24.078 --> 14:26.779
and just his head is
floating above the water.

14:27.147 --> 14:30.250
And when we turn the air
on, if he goes up or down,

14:30.317 --> 14:32.486
that will tell us what's really happening.

14:32.554 --> 14:34.888
It's time to sink or swim.

14:39.163 --> 14:41.602
Kari, Tory and Grant are testing the myth

14:41.627 --> 14:44.927
that a dynamite arrow can
split a tree down the middle.

14:45.203 --> 14:49.070
But, so far, it's got the team
well and truly stumped.

14:49.937 --> 14:52.305
Well, the tree is still in one piece.

14:52.573 --> 14:54.508
Yeah, I don't even see a crack.

14:55.142 --> 14:57.777
Today's solution, double the dynamite.

14:57.845 --> 15:01.381
So, this is two times the explosives
that we used on the first test.

15:01.749 --> 15:04.784
Let's see if this is enough to
split the tree down the middle.

15:04.851 --> 15:06.019
Arr, we're late, we're late.

15:07.187 --> 15:09.155
All right, Grantie, call it.

15:09.223 --> 15:11.124
So this is splitting a tree with dynamite,

15:11.292 --> 15:12.225
double the explosives.

15:12.593 --> 15:15.628
In three, two, one.

15:17.196 --> 15:19.065
Whoa!

15:19.533 --> 15:20.100
Yeah.

15:20.167 --> 15:22.972
That was a good blast.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.743
Well, I say this is looking
pretty bad for the myth.

15:30.510 --> 15:33.279
Yeah, I mean we used twice the
amount of explosives as the myth

15:33.280 --> 15:37.185
calls for, and still we did not
get any cleaving whatsoever.

15:38.353 --> 15:43.524
Even with two sticks of modern dynamite,
the tree was left with hardly a scratch.

15:44.091 --> 15:45.258
Let alone a cleave.

15:45.326 --> 15:47.093
And Grant thinks he knows why.

15:47.761 --> 15:51.231
Now, my theory is that
the dynamite is outside,

15:51.256 --> 15:53.397
and when you explode it, all that energy

15:53.398 --> 15:55.535
just gets dissipated away from the tree,

15:55.603 --> 15:58.371
and not where we actually
need it to be focused,

15:58.739 --> 16:01.341
which is right on the trunk
in order to split it.

16:01.108 --> 16:06.079
And, without that focus, the myth,
unlike the tree, is looking busted.

16:06.247 --> 16:07.414
So what's next?

16:07.781 --> 16:11.150
Well, any more explosives
strapped to that arrow

16:11.218 --> 16:13.721
it's gonna mess with the aerodynamics,
there's no way it's gonna fly.

16:13.788 --> 16:17.691
So why don't we just push an arrow into
the tree, put as many explosives on it

16:17.759 --> 16:20.861
as J.D. will allow, and just
see if we can get anything.

16:21.028 --> 16:22.629
Now you're talking.

16:23.297 --> 16:26.867
For round three, the MythBusters
are going gang busters.

16:26.935 --> 16:30.704
Strapping an arrow with as much
dynamite as can be crammed on,

16:30.772 --> 16:33.006
but too much for it to actually fly.

16:33.674 --> 16:35.274
So how much is too much?

16:35.642 --> 16:39.580
J.D. says the amount we can use
out here is six sticks of dynamite.

16:39.648 --> 16:41.716
Is that gonna split the
tree down the middle?

16:41.784 --> 16:42.850
I don't know.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.618
But we're gonna get a big bang.

16:44.686 --> 16:46.787
Six drops of essence of terror.

16:46.855 --> 16:48.355
Five drops of sinister sauce.

16:49.123 --> 16:53.693
With the mother of all explosive arrows
prepped and embedded in the tree...

16:53.961 --> 16:55.996
The mega-arrow is in place.

16:56.097 --> 16:58.231
...the team is taking no chances.

16:58.299 --> 16:59.633
They'll hunker in the bunker,

16:59.701 --> 17:01.537
because this is going to be big.

17:01.572 --> 17:05.872
Fire in the hole!

17:06.739 --> 17:09.942
This is splitting the tree
with dynamite, six sticks.

17:10.010 --> 17:12.609
In three, two, one.

17:17.652 --> 17:20.055
That was a good explosion.

17:22.123 --> 17:23.723
Let's see if we split the tree.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.157
I don't think so.

17:25.226 --> 17:27.329
We rattled the bunker.

17:31.031 --> 17:34.200
There's just no timber on the timber.

17:34.268 --> 17:37.404
Even with six sticks of
dynamite, the shock wave

17:37.505 --> 17:40.740
barely scratches the surface,
let alone causes a cleave.

17:40.808 --> 17:42.941
So, it's back to the drawing board.

17:43.009 --> 17:44.879
So right now this myth is looking busted.

17:44.947 --> 17:47.082
We used one stick of dynamite,
two sticks of dynamite,

17:47.150 --> 17:50.952
finally six sticks of dynamite and
it was not enough to split the tree

17:51.020 --> 17:52.887
at the middle, like the myth talked about.

17:53.288 --> 17:54.521
But, this is MythBusters.

17:54.522 --> 17:55.763
We're gonna go deeper,

17:55.789 --> 17:57.623
not stop here, we're gonna figure out

17:57.691 --> 18:01.828
is there a way to use nothing
but explosives to split that tree.

18:02.396 --> 18:05.133
Next up, Adam, the human hydrometer.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.101
Like riding a bucking bronco.

18:07.126 --> 18:09.826
But, will he sink without a trace?

18:15.603 --> 18:19.505
In "Bubble Trouble", Adam is
about to find out if decreasing

18:19.573 --> 18:23.543
the density of water with air means
you'll sink without a trace.

18:23.610 --> 18:28.282
And to do that, Adam's ditched the
scuba tank and turned himself

18:28.349 --> 18:30.920
into a neutrally buoyant human hydrometer.

18:31.187 --> 18:34.658
My wet suit makes me quite floatacious.

18:34.683 --> 18:37.883
I'm overly buoyant, so I'm putting weights

18:37.926 --> 18:41.431
around my waist, so that
I will be neutrally buoyant.

18:41.532 --> 18:44.401
Ideally, floating right around here.

18:44.568 --> 18:49.074
Then, we'll be able to see the best effect
that the bubbles might have on you.

18:49.099 --> 18:50.299
All right, let's try it.

18:52.024 --> 18:53.124
I think that's perfect.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.342
It's a simple test.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.967
Let's fire up the compressor.

18:56.710 --> 19:00.949
When Jamie turns on the bubbler, if
Adam sinks, the myth is looking good.

19:01.017 --> 19:03.788
Okay, open the valve to the mark please.

19:08.856 --> 19:09.789
Here they come!

19:09.857 --> 19:13.527
With the bubbles on, Adam does go under.

19:13.594 --> 19:15.962
But not quite as planned.

19:16.630 --> 19:20.600
He first gets pushed to the side
and only then does he sink.

19:26.205 --> 19:28.641
I'll tell you, it's not making
me sink like a stone.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.111
But it is creating this
really strong current

19:31.179 --> 19:32.982
that is throwing me to the side

19:33.007 --> 19:35.907
and I feel like it is dragging
me down a little bit.

19:35.949 --> 19:38.317
You don't seem to be
able to stay right there.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.585
No, I definitely can't stay on top of this.

19:40.622 --> 19:44.724
It's very, very... it's a
super strong push. And if I...

19:44.792 --> 19:48.762
"...get pushed to the side I get dragged
under" is what he was going to say.

19:50.330 --> 19:52.966
It seems Adam is being lifted up and away

19:52.967 --> 19:54.800
from the central column of bubbles,

19:54.901 --> 19:57.738
and then, just like a convection current,

19:57.739 --> 20:00.775
there's a downward draft at the outer edge.

20:01.876 --> 20:03.076
Where to from here?

20:03.544 --> 20:06.013
Well, I think if we're seeing
this kind of effect

20:06.014 --> 20:08.916
where it's an upwelling that
drags me down on the outside,

20:08.983 --> 20:11.485
let's turn it up and see if the
effect gets more pronounced.

20:12.153 --> 20:13.353
My kind of thinking.

20:13.421 --> 20:17.457
Of course, it's the one instruction
that fits all mythbusting occasions.

20:17.525 --> 20:19.361
Ramp it up.

20:22.128 --> 20:24.232
And as they turn it up again...

20:24.257 --> 20:25.457
Let's, er, move it up another notch.

20:26.700 --> 20:30.570
The bigger current pushes
Adam to the side faster.

20:30.637 --> 20:32.406
I'm on top of the bubbles!

20:32.674 --> 20:36.012
In fact, the upwelling of water
associated with the rising bubbles...

20:38.137 --> 20:40.037
The current is really strong!

20:40.080 --> 20:42.818
...is pushing him upwards
until he reaches the sides,

20:42.843 --> 20:45.143
leaving just one further test.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.389
We need more power, Scottie!

20:48.257 --> 20:52.559
Jamie just made a Star Trek
reference! Awesome!

20:52.561 --> 20:56.100
And with the compressor giving us all she's got...

20:58.625 --> 21:01.125
Like riding a bucking bronco!

21:02.068 --> 21:04.872
Jamie and Adam are ready to wrap it up.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.942
I don't feel like we can call
it on the basis of this tank.

21:09.043 --> 21:12.112
I think it's actually too small.

21:12.180 --> 21:16.716
This current being everything,
it sort of overwhelms

21:16.783 --> 21:18.584
the original story, which is about bubbles.

21:18.652 --> 21:23.589
So, I feel like we need to create
more bubbles in a much bigger space.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.992
The myth is you can't swim in bubbles.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.795
There is no swimming going on in there,

21:29.162 --> 21:29.829
it's treading.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.965
We need to go someplace we can
do some... some swimming.

21:33.033 --> 21:37.169
The close proximity of the tank's walls
has rendered the results unreliable.

21:37.237 --> 21:41.074
To truly test the myth, they'll need
somewhere with much more room

21:41.099 --> 21:42.299
to make a splash in.

21:42.575 --> 21:43.642
This was a great test.

21:43.810 --> 21:47.046
It was also an excellent proof of
concept for my prototype bubble maker.

21:47.214 --> 21:50.116
It put thing in a human scale
and showed us a lot about

21:50.183 --> 21:53.219
bubbles and how they interact with water.

21:53.287 --> 21:56.889
But given that this myth is about
swimming and bubbles, to test it

21:57.057 --> 22:00.259
properly, we're gonna have
to go up yet more in the scale.

22:04.698 --> 22:09.639
After three big booms, the
myth of a dynamite axe is, well...

22:09.664 --> 22:12.364
100% busted. You're never
gonna split a tree

22:12.406 --> 22:14.710
using one stick of dynamite,
let alone six sticks of dynamite.

22:14.735 --> 22:17.735
Yeah, all the energy is going
outward, it's completely external.

22:17.778 --> 22:20.046
I think to actually cleave the tree
you need something inside.

22:20.114 --> 22:22.449
All right, what if we tried
reconfiguring the explosives,

22:22.517 --> 22:25.917
get it closer to the core, maybe that
will split the tree up the middle.

22:25.985 --> 22:27.622
Yeah, let's go to a smaller scale,
so we can experiment

22:27.647 --> 22:29.447
with different kinds of explosives.

22:29.490 --> 22:30.523
Great idea.

22:31.191 --> 22:34.460
Much as they love blowing
things up, this myth is about

22:34.528 --> 22:36.629
dividing the tree, not destroying it.

22:36.997 --> 22:39.999
So in small scale, the guys are
going to start by putting

22:40.067 --> 22:41.367
two explosives head to head.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.971
The first type is TNT, or trinitrotoluene.

22:45.038 --> 22:48.140
And this is a faster moving,
more tearing explosive.

22:48.208 --> 22:52.845
The other kind of explosive we're gonna
be using is Anfo; that is a slower

22:52.913 --> 22:54.447
moving explosive, but it
has more pushing power.

22:54.514 --> 22:57.985
We're gonna see if either of those
is able to split our tree

22:58.010 --> 22:59.785
up the middle, just like the myth.

22:59.786 --> 23:03.990
But switching the explosives and
using tiny quantities aren't

23:04.058 --> 23:06.892
the only changes they're
drilling down for this test.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.662
So what we've done here is solve
what I think is the biggest

23:09.763 --> 23:13.066
problem of our previous test,
which is getting the explosive

23:13.134 --> 23:16.069
to where it needs to be, which
is the strength of the tree,

23:16.136 --> 23:17.170
the core, the hardwood.

23:17.537 --> 23:20.409
But, will this internal
placement cause the cleave

23:20.434 --> 23:22.734
that dynamite arrow couldn't?

23:22.777 --> 23:25.148
Well, to find out, they're
starting by embedding

23:25.215 --> 23:27.116
explosive one: the TNT.

23:27.641 --> 23:28.841
Smoke!

23:30.083 --> 23:33.619
All right, this is TNT in
the looney pine tree.

23:34.787 --> 23:36.088
Let's do it.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.325
It is a tense way for
the fuse to burn down.

23:39.393 --> 23:40.693
Until...

23:42.518 --> 23:45.018
It might have had "the boom"...

23:45.234 --> 23:49.237
but did it give the team
the kind of break they need?

23:51.604 --> 23:53.639
I see some cracking going on,

23:53.706 --> 23:56.007
but not what I would call a split.

23:56.075 --> 23:58.713
Yeah, it seems like it's shredding
more than anything.

24:00.514 --> 24:02.049
Tory's on the money.

24:02.116 --> 24:05.218
Traveling at more than 21,000 feet
per second, the shock wave

24:05.286 --> 24:09.122
from the TNT simply ripped
the tree to pieces.

24:09.290 --> 24:13.060
Will there low velocity
explosive do any better?

24:13.328 --> 24:16.765
This is Anfo, which stands for
ammonium nitrate fuel oil.

24:16.833 --> 24:20.272
It's a lower velocity explosive
than TNT, which means it has

24:20.297 --> 24:22.797
a higher likelihood of
actually splitting the tree

24:22.822 --> 24:24.322
without shredding it.

24:27.540 --> 24:30.476
What I've just done is cut some vertical
grooves in the bark of the tree.

24:30.544 --> 24:34.213
That way we can lay up our
explosives along the grain,

24:34.281 --> 24:36.515
the vascular bundles of the tree.

24:36.583 --> 24:39.052
'Cause what's happening right now,
is we have an explosive at the base

24:39.077 --> 24:40.219
and it is cross cutting.

24:40.220 --> 24:42.388
What we want is a vertical split.

24:42.456 --> 24:45.425
So this way we put the explosives
up the line of the tree,

24:45.450 --> 24:47.550
and that force punches
through, and hopefully

24:47.593 --> 24:49.696
we get that vertical split
that we're looking for.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.264
All right, the grooves are loaded.

24:51.332 --> 24:52.198
We're going hot.

24:53.233 --> 24:54.934
All right, we're lit.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.368
Okay.

24:56.436 --> 25:01.877
So this is cutting a tree in half
with explosives, zipper technique.

25:05.145 --> 25:07.980
It didn't go completely to plan.

25:08.348 --> 25:12.652
But at least the team gets slightly
more than a toppled trunk.

25:13.420 --> 25:16.823
It's kind of a split
in the right direction.

25:17.424 --> 25:18.124
Wow!

25:18.191 --> 25:20.226
That is definitely a better technique.

25:20.293 --> 25:22.596
Finally, we got a split.

25:23.630 --> 25:24.497
Of sorts.

25:24.865 --> 25:28.634
It's still not the clean cleave
they wanted, but promising enough

25:28.702 --> 25:33.405
to warrant one more go at
a mighty grand finale.

25:33.507 --> 25:35.308
What did we do right?

25:35.376 --> 25:38.180
Well, on this test we got
our explosive in a line

25:38.205 --> 25:40.905
that's parallel to the grain of the tree.

25:40.947 --> 25:43.884
Instead of focussing on one spot,
we went all the way up the tree,

25:43.951 --> 25:46.386
and I think that is what
made the difference.

25:46.453 --> 25:47.553
Now, this is a small tree.

25:47.621 --> 25:50.454
But that's fine, we proved
the concept here.

25:50.490 --> 25:54.026
Now it's time for us to go onto
a big tree, and try it full scale.

25:54.594 --> 25:58.231
Coming up, almost a ton
of run-away rogue steel

25:58.256 --> 25:59.356
heading Adam's way.

25:59.399 --> 26:00.899
This is where things get dangerous.

26:05.714 --> 26:08.685
So far, bubble trouble
is looking like a bust.

26:08.752 --> 26:10.852
Wow, I feel that totally lifted me!

26:11.420 --> 26:13.755
But Adam and Jamie aren't done yet.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.524
Ow!

26:16.692 --> 26:18.359
I took a pin in the leg.

26:18.927 --> 26:21.796
To put this myth to bed,
they're going to sink or swim

26:21.831 --> 26:25.166
in a full size pool
with a super size bubbler.

26:25.201 --> 26:29.505
One that's four feet
wide and 16 feet long.

26:30.673 --> 26:34.243
And to get job done in double
time, Jamie welds the massive

26:34.311 --> 26:38.750
steel frame, while Adam sews
the giant canvas bubbler bag.

26:39.717 --> 26:43.988
Well, based on what we
saw at the big tank,

26:46.056 --> 26:48.791
this new bladder ought to be
perfect for the swimming pool.

26:49.558 --> 26:50.291
Do you know what it looks like?

26:51.059 --> 26:54.332
It looks like the world's
largest whoopi cushion.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.337
With both bubbler components ready to roll,

26:59.362 --> 27:01.162
the truck gets loaded and locked.

27:02.504 --> 27:05.507
So, the myth is that it is impossible
to swim in bubbly water.

27:05.575 --> 27:08.344
And so far we've tested that
in small scale, in a fish tank...

27:08.369 --> 27:09.569
It's not sinking.

27:09.612 --> 27:13.349
and in a 10,000 gallon irrigation tank
in what is now only medium scale.

27:13.416 --> 27:15.251
I'm on top of the bubbles!

27:15.318 --> 27:18.423
In both cases we found evidence
of upwelling and currents.

27:18.448 --> 27:21.348
It really makes us feel like we
haven't fully answered this question,

27:21.391 --> 27:24.293
so now it is time for mondo scale.

27:24.361 --> 27:25.528
Full time swimming pool.

27:25.553 --> 27:26.753
Yeah. That's it.

27:26.829 --> 27:29.866
We've built a bubbler that will
give us a swath of bubbles

27:29.933 --> 27:32.167
four feet wide and 16 feet long.

27:32.235 --> 27:35.171
I'm going to get in it
and see if I can swim.

27:35.539 --> 27:36.071
Yeah.

27:36.139 --> 27:39.042
We recognize that you have a
choice of myths and we thank you

27:39.043 --> 27:40.644
for flying "MythBusters."

27:41.911 --> 27:43.612
That's nice and stable.

27:43.613 --> 27:46.516
Remember those little fish
tank bubblers and then that

27:46.584 --> 27:48.685
little bag that I tested out in the shop?

27:48.753 --> 27:49.953
That's not bad.

27:49.978 --> 27:51.178
Well...

27:51.221 --> 27:54.022
this is the final result
of all that testing.

27:54.090 --> 27:55.724
The granddaddy bubbler.

27:55.792 --> 28:00.029
We've got I-beams on it to hold
it down against the flotation,

28:00.097 --> 28:03.833
we've got a massive steel frame,
the big bladder and not one,

28:03.834 --> 28:06.968
but two air pumps to supply
all the air we need.

28:07.136 --> 28:08.970
We drop it in the pool...

28:09.038 --> 28:11.206
and you've got yourself
a big-ass bubbler.

28:11.274 --> 28:16.646
It's big, but will it be big enough to
eliminate those supposed edge effects?

28:18.414 --> 28:21.950
Well, to find out, Adam, designated
to do the wet work, goes under

28:22.018 --> 28:25.154
to guide it into position
and make sure it's level.

28:25.855 --> 28:29.224
It's within one or two degrees to
level and I'm inclined to start up

28:29.292 --> 28:31.026
the pump and see what it looks like.

28:31.094 --> 28:31.761
I'm on it.

28:31.828 --> 28:32.461
Okay.

28:33.529 --> 28:35.865
Okay, go ahead and let some air in.

28:37.432 --> 28:41.002
With the air pump on, things
seem to be proceeding smoothly.

28:41.269 --> 28:42.406
Until...

28:48.343 --> 28:49.410
Cut the air!

28:49.411 --> 28:53.181
Luckily, Adam was clear of the
rig when it made an unexpected

28:53.248 --> 28:55.483
and dangerous break for the surface.

28:55.551 --> 28:58.656
And make no mistake,
despite the muffled noise

28:58.724 --> 29:03.261
and sub-aqua slow motion,
that was 1,600 pounds

29:03.286 --> 29:05.686
of run-away rogue steel.

29:05.728 --> 29:07.229
Not enough weight?

29:07.497 --> 29:08.464
Not enough weight.

29:08.531 --> 29:09.899
The whole thing started to float.

29:09.967 --> 29:10.633
Well, that's a...

29:10.658 --> 29:11.300
Bummer.

29:11.301 --> 29:13.068
...but the solution is simple.

29:14.035 --> 29:17.973
It could simply be a matter of just placing
the barbell weights in the corners.

29:18.041 --> 29:20.209
Well, that's why we brought the barbells.

29:20.277 --> 29:21.277
I'll start to break them out.

29:22.378 --> 29:24.714
With an additional 100
pounds on each corner,

29:24.815 --> 29:28.884
totalling 2,000 pounds, surely
they've got this covered.

29:29.652 --> 29:31.621
Cue test number two.

29:33.489 --> 29:35.990
I see little bubbles starting to come up.

29:36.058 --> 29:39.028
And at first it all seems to
be working beautifully.

29:39.995 --> 29:43.866
But once again, the astonishing
force exerted by the buoyancy

29:43.933 --> 29:45.734
of the trapped air is evident.

29:45.968 --> 29:46.501
Stop.

29:46.569 --> 29:47.469
Cut the air.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.038
And that's another...

29:49.063 --> 29:49.904
Bummer.

29:49.905 --> 29:50.472
Yeah.

29:50.939 --> 29:52.306
It was looking so good.

29:52.374 --> 29:57.245
It was looking so good, but
now the whole rig [ bleep ].

29:57.413 --> 29:58.046
Yeah.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.683
So far the team has selected
option F for "failure".

30:01.750 --> 30:05.522
But it takes more than 2,000
pounds of runaway steel to throw

30:05.523 --> 30:07.424
the "MythBusters" off their game.

30:07.449 --> 30:09.349
This is just a minor setback,

30:09.392 --> 30:12.561
all we need are heavier I-beams
or bars of steel of some sort

30:12.629 --> 30:15.130
to put on this thing. We'll
be able to weight it down.

30:15.197 --> 30:16.031
We'll fix it.

30:16.498 --> 30:19.133
Look, when you want to rescue big
things from the bottom of a body

30:19.201 --> 30:22.470
of water, you use what
are called lift bags.

30:22.505 --> 30:24.339
These are air-tight canvas bags

30:24.407 --> 30:27.275
you fill with air, and the air
lifts stuff off the bottom.

30:27.343 --> 30:31.279
What we've essentially made
here is a captured air bladder.

30:31.647 --> 30:35.016
And we're trying to keep it on
the bottom, which is proving more

30:35.084 --> 30:37.585
of a challenge than we surmised.

30:37.653 --> 30:39.588
That's a workout, huh!

30:39.656 --> 30:40.523
[ bleep ].

30:41.190 --> 30:43.926
This is where things get dangerous,

30:44.127 --> 30:45.261
late in the day.

30:46.128 --> 30:47.696
Let's test it out.

30:47.697 --> 30:48.397
Yeah.

30:49.265 --> 30:49.831
Right in place?

30:49.899 --> 30:50.665
Yeah.

30:50.733 --> 30:53.671
I'm gonna stay far away from
this rig while you pressurize it.

30:54.138 --> 30:58.842
Their first unsuccessful test of the
rig weighted in at 1,600 pounds.

30:58.909 --> 31:01.509
This time they've got 4,200.

31:01.577 --> 31:03.143
But, will this be enough?

31:03.211 --> 31:04.779
There they come.

31:06.547 --> 31:07.917
Yeah, baby!

31:09.385 --> 31:12.921
So, that may have been about halfway.

31:12.989 --> 31:13.789
That's perfect.

31:13.857 --> 31:15.057
Nothing is budging.

31:15.124 --> 31:15.724
It looks gorgeous.

31:15.792 --> 31:16.358
Excellent.

31:16.926 --> 31:18.326
So, we had a few bugs to work out.

31:18.394 --> 31:19.294
So sue me.

31:19.662 --> 31:21.362
We added more weight.

31:21.430 --> 31:24.465
It took care of the buoyancy
problem, and we're all tested.

31:24.533 --> 31:25.466
Good to go.

31:25.734 --> 31:27.904
I think we're ready for tomorrow.

31:30.672 --> 31:35.209
Next, the big bang on the
mother of all pine trees.

31:35.210 --> 31:37.010
That is one big tree.

31:37.378 --> 31:38.311
Fire!

31:43.853 --> 31:46.154
Now, we've already busted the myth
that you can use a dynamite

31:46.222 --> 31:47.656
arrow to split a tree in two.

31:47.724 --> 31:49.727
But, we wanted to find out if you can use

31:49.752 --> 31:52.052
explosives to create that perfect cleave.

31:52.194 --> 31:53.795
So, we did a few experiments.

31:53.863 --> 31:56.199
We tried TNT, we tried Anfo.

31:57.167 --> 31:59.701
As you can see, it didn't quite
work from a singular point.

31:59.769 --> 32:02.004
So, we went and took it one step further.

32:02.072 --> 32:03.946
We made sort of a a zipper,
by perforating the tree

32:03.971 --> 32:06.071
with little slots and
filling them with Anfo.

32:07.471 --> 32:08.813
And we did get a split.

32:08.814 --> 32:11.782
So now, it's time to take it to full scale.

32:12.717 --> 32:16.353
We've come out to the forest, to make
a tree split "MythBusters style".

32:16.422 --> 32:20.356
Doing it "MythBusters style" means
driving to an isolated tree farm...

32:20.424 --> 32:22.760
Man, this is way out there, isn't it?

32:22.828 --> 32:25.296
...and blowing the biggest tree they can see,

32:25.364 --> 32:28.999
with a technique they... sort
of perfected in small scale.

32:29.067 --> 32:31.068
It's like a winter wonderland down here.

32:31.136 --> 32:33.603
You can't see the trees for the forest.

32:35.271 --> 32:36.705
Here's the tree.

32:36.839 --> 32:37.873
Wow!

32:37.974 --> 32:39.808
That's one big tree.

32:39.875 --> 32:40.909
Definitely.

32:40.977 --> 32:44.046
This is a 100-foot tall Ponderosa pine.

32:44.113 --> 32:45.882
Now, you might be a little
freaked out that we're using

32:45.907 --> 32:47.607
a perfectly good tree in our experiment.

32:47.650 --> 32:50.553
But it's already been earmarked for lumber,

32:50.620 --> 32:52.756
and it will be recycled at
the end of the experiment.

32:52.823 --> 32:55.958
Depending on how successful
we are, that'll either be lumber,

32:56.125 --> 32:58.594
or, if we manage to split it, fire wood.

32:59.262 --> 33:04.700
Given their early results, splitting this
tall tree seems like an even taller order.

33:05.001 --> 33:07.836
But Tory for one is confident.

33:07.904 --> 33:13.442
Now, we learned from our small scale
that Anfo was the best type of explosive.

33:13.509 --> 33:15.744
It was slower moving, more pushy.

33:15.812 --> 33:18.980
And, what we also learned is
cutting grooves along the vertical

33:19.048 --> 33:22.850
of the tree will give us a better
chance of splitting the tree.

33:22.852 --> 33:24.085
So we're going to do just that.

33:24.087 --> 33:27.022
We're gonna cut a bunch of
grooves up the length of the tree,

33:27.090 --> 33:29.624
so that way the force of
the explosion is vertical,

33:29.692 --> 33:32.461
and hopefully we can replicate the results.

33:32.528 --> 33:35.464
In other words, going big
means thinking small.

33:35.531 --> 33:41.372
Cutting lots of vertical slots near the
core to house small bags of "boom".

33:44.340 --> 33:48.143
All right, so we finished cutting
15 slots up the length of the tree.

33:48.211 --> 33:52.013
Now what we're going to do is
we're gonna fill those slots with Anfo,

33:52.248 --> 33:55.484
ignite them and see if we can
split this tree up the middle.

33:56.251 --> 33:59.588
But first, they need to
do a serious calculation

33:59.656 --> 34:02.091
of just how much bang
they need for their buck.

34:02.759 --> 34:07.030
Okay, now when you usually see
explosives into the MythBusters scene,

34:07.097 --> 34:10.605
you're used to seeing mass
quantities,  like the 850 pounds

34:10.630 --> 34:11.830
we used in the cement truck.

34:17.373 --> 34:22.443
Now for this experiment, we actually want
a pushing rather than a huge destruction.

34:22.511 --> 34:25.284
So we're only gonna use
about 25 pounds of Anfo,

34:25.310 --> 34:28.909
in small bags, strung evenly
up the side of the tree.

34:29.585 --> 34:32.187
That way, hopefully we
get a nice clean cleave.

34:32.755 --> 34:34.156
It's a delicate operation.

34:34.223 --> 34:36.891
Too much Anfo, and the
tree will be blown apart.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.895
Too little, and the explosive
may not even detonate.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.062
All right.

34:41.230 --> 34:43.199
So one pound bags.

34:43.266 --> 34:44.399
One pound bags.

34:44.467 --> 34:48.969
Luckily, bomb expert Frank is on
hand to take charge of the charge.

34:49.038 --> 34:49.704
What do you think, Frank?

34:49.772 --> 34:52.607
Am I going to be able to join
the bomb squad after this?

34:52.675 --> 34:54.643
We're signing you up right now.

34:55.210 --> 34:55.710
All right.

34:55.777 --> 34:57.550
Ready to decorate the tree?

34:57.575 --> 34:58.775
Ready to wire in.

35:01.918 --> 35:03.385
Anfo?

35:03.452 --> 35:04.386
There you go.

35:04.453 --> 35:08.629
Working somewhat gingerly, Kari
and Grant carefully place

35:08.654 --> 35:11.754
the 25 one pound bags
along the entire trunk.

35:11.796 --> 35:16.167
You know what? The sap is a natural
adhesive to holding the bags in.

35:17.235 --> 35:21.471
So add wiring explosives
at heights to my resume.

35:21.472 --> 35:22.813
All right, you're done?

35:22.839 --> 35:23.739
I'm done.

35:23.740 --> 35:25.010
And, as the saying goes...

35:25.135 --> 35:26.735
Let's make like a tree and leave.

35:28.378 --> 35:33.550
Going down on this level, we have
explosives, timber and ladies' lingerie.

35:34.817 --> 35:38.754
Hey, this is the very last bag
of explosives going in the tree.

35:39.021 --> 35:41.857
We've wired them all the way up.

35:41.925 --> 35:43.559
I think we might have a shot at this one.

35:43.593 --> 35:46.195
I mean, we've given it all the
advantage we possibly could,

35:46.963 --> 35:49.398
using this nice low velocity explosive,

35:49.466 --> 35:53.169
we've given it a perforation, so
that it could go really really well,

35:53.236 --> 35:55.705
I think we might get a nice, clean split.

35:55.773 --> 35:58.373
But the guys, on the
other hand, aren't so sure.

35:58.441 --> 35:59.876
So, do I think the tree is gonna split?

35:59.944 --> 36:02.112
There's a lot of factors that go into it.

36:02.180 --> 36:05.081
Too much explosive, too little,
the weight of the branches...

36:05.083 --> 36:07.917
Given all that, I think
we are gonna get a split.

36:07.985 --> 36:10.152
Maybe not super clean,
but it's gonna split.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.591
Looking at all this Anfo,
and this tree, I have a feeling

36:13.616 --> 36:15.816
we're just gonna blow this
tree in a bunch of pieces.

36:16.559 --> 36:18.193
Yeah, this looks safe enough here.

36:18.294 --> 36:19.327
All right.

36:19.395 --> 36:21.528
I guess we're all set. Are you guys ready?

36:21.530 --> 36:23.467
I'm so ready.

36:23.468 --> 36:25.035
Fire in the hole!

36:27.103 --> 36:28.103
Fire in the hole!

36:28.170 --> 36:31.641
Okay, so this is splitting
a tree with Anfo.

36:32.408 --> 36:33.608
Here we go.

36:33.676 --> 36:38.179
In three, two, one!

36:38.314 --> 36:43.084
After the break, sink or swim
in the mythical fable of fizz.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.086
Swim harder.

36:48.756 --> 36:52.759
So, do you want to know why we did what
we did and didn't do what we didn't do?

36:52.794 --> 36:55.894
Well, go to
discovery.com/mythbustersaftershow

36:55.919 --> 36:57.719
and watch our aftershow!

36:57.929 --> 37:00.903
Keep those questions and
comments coming in.

37:04.738 --> 37:06.772
After double trouble with the bubbler...

37:06.997 --> 37:08.197
Cut the air.

37:09.140 --> 37:11.478
Adam and Jamie are ready to test the myth

37:11.503 --> 37:14.303
that it's impossible to
swim in bubbly water.

37:15.447 --> 37:17.348
Okay, swimming with bubbles.

37:17.416 --> 37:22.020
In three, two, one, go!

37:23.088 --> 37:27.190
On the first lap, displaying all of
his exemplary style and technique,

37:27.292 --> 37:29.126
Adam powers through the bubbles.

37:29.194 --> 37:31.862
But on the way back, it is not so easy.

37:32.230 --> 37:35.200
Just like the small scale
tests, the upwelling current

37:35.268 --> 37:37.671
pushes him to the side and outweighs

37:37.696 --> 37:40.438
 any effect the lower density may have.

37:40.739 --> 37:41.839
Okay.

37:42.206 --> 37:44.277
At this stage it seems the
myth that it is impossible

37:44.311 --> 37:47.012
to swim in bubbly water
is pretty much busted.

37:47.279 --> 37:49.815
It does, however, seem to be more difficult

37:49.882 --> 37:52.486
to swim in bubbky water, and
the timings we've been taking

37:52.511 --> 37:54.911
from my testing seem to bear that out.

37:55.154 --> 37:57.422
So, given that there might be
a grain of truth to this story,

37:57.490 --> 38:00.861
that it might be more difficult, but
not impossible, to swim in bubbly water,

38:00.886 --> 38:02.986
we're gonna ramp it up as far as we can go,

38:03.028 --> 38:06.565
and see if we can't make that
artifact more pronounced.

38:06.633 --> 38:09.235
We've done our testing at one
quarter compressor capacity.

38:09.902 --> 38:14.004
And the results were interesting,
but perhaps not conclusive.

38:14.072 --> 38:17.042
So, I think now it's time to ramp it up.

38:17.109 --> 38:18.409
That's more like it.

38:18.977 --> 38:22.614
And that means we're gonna go
full power with those compressors.

38:22.681 --> 38:23.915
We'll see what happens.

38:23.983 --> 38:27.185
Wow. That's a lot of bubbles!

38:27.853 --> 38:28.886
You ready?

38:28.954 --> 38:29.720
Ready.

38:29.788 --> 38:30.754
All right.

38:30.822 --> 38:33.225
Full scale bubble test.

38:33.226 --> 38:37.761
In three, two, one, go!

38:37.929 --> 38:43.034
With the dial turned to 11, the forces
Adam has to deal with are clearly evident.

38:44.002 --> 38:46.175
Despite looking quite serene below,

38:46.200 --> 38:49.500
it'ts a broiling, frothing
volcano at the surface.

38:49.543 --> 38:53.146
And the current is just too
strong to swim across.

38:53.771 --> 38:55.271
Swin harder!

38:55.347 --> 38:59.182
Meaning, in this case, it
is impossible to swim in.

38:59.250 --> 39:02.419
Like any good myth, this one has
a grain of truth in its heart.

39:02.487 --> 39:04.824
And that is that when
you mix air with water,

39:04.849 --> 39:07.249
it is going to make that water less dense.

39:07.492 --> 39:11.328
The thing is that by taking it to
ridiculous extremes like we have...

39:11.396 --> 39:13.430
You're just not trying hard enough.

39:13.498 --> 39:14.732
Stop screwing around.

39:14.799 --> 39:18.872
...that decrease in density
relative to its surroundings

39:18.873 --> 39:22.840
causes an upwelling and a
very vigorous current, in fact.

39:23.908 --> 39:26.812
That current is so vigorous,
that it makes it

39:26.837 --> 39:28.637
virtually impossible to swim through.

39:28.680 --> 39:30.881
I swallowed some water.

39:31.982 --> 39:35.419
After small scale, medium scale,
and full scale, it wasn't

39:35.487 --> 39:39.558
until super full scale that they got
the result they were looking for.

39:39.626 --> 39:41.727
And Adam for one is buoyant.

39:42.228 --> 39:45.963
This myth is a letter perfect case
for why I love doing this show.

39:46.031 --> 39:49.433
We started out with the myth about it being
impossible to swim in bubbly water.

39:49.501 --> 39:52.436
The conventional wisdom being
that bubbles make the water less

39:52.504 --> 39:55.806
dense and thus you would sink,
when in fact it turns out that

39:55.874 --> 40:01.278
the bubbles create this churning upwelling
of current as they rise to the surface,

40:01.479 --> 40:04.882
and it is the current, and not the
bubbles, that makes it in fact

40:04.950 --> 40:07.117
impossible to swim in bubbly water.

40:07.185 --> 40:09.788
I love being surprised
by results like that.

40:10.855 --> 40:12.122
That's pretty neat.

40:12.224 --> 40:14.191
We had a build that it was
more difficult than we thought,

40:14.259 --> 40:17.929
a surprise ending and a myth
that is, I gotta say, plausible,

40:17.996 --> 40:20.163
but not for the reasons
we originally thought.

40:20.731 --> 40:24.067
And bubbly water is kind
of festive, isn't it?

40:24.735 --> 40:27.035
Yes, yes, it is.

40:34.012 --> 40:38.249
Busting the myth of the explosive
tree split has been a bit of a misfire.

40:39.317 --> 40:41.054
From big scale failure...

40:41.179 --> 40:42.879
The tree is still in one piece.

40:43.922 --> 40:46.223
To some small scale success.

40:46.324 --> 40:47.057
Wow!

40:47.125 --> 40:49.960
That is definitely a better technique.

40:50.028 --> 40:51.929
But now, the moment of truth.

40:52.063 --> 40:53.063
Here we go.

40:53.131 --> 40:58.736
To replicate the results of this myth,
it all comes down to this one-shot wonder.

40:59.303 --> 41:04.040
One monster pine tree filled
with 25 bags of explosives.

41:04.142 --> 41:07.812
They're using the smallest amount
of Anfo that will still detonate.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.114
But, will it be small enough?

41:10.615 --> 41:14.349
In three, two, one!

41:14.417 --> 41:16.017
Fire!

41:19.991 --> 41:20.457
Wow!

41:20.725 --> 41:24.095
That was a good one.

41:25.229 --> 41:27.266
Well, the tree is down.

41:29.133 --> 41:31.435
Let's go see if it split.

41:31.502 --> 41:33.705
If there's anything left of it.

41:33.772 --> 41:34.339
Wow!

41:35.906 --> 41:38.976
Well, what's clear is the Anfo detonated.

41:39.044 --> 41:42.379
But what is not clear is
what happened to the tree.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.714
Wow.

41:43.782 --> 41:46.751
There are bits of tree everywhere.

41:48.119 --> 41:51.387
With the smoke gone, it's
bad news for the myth.

41:51.455 --> 41:53.630
Instead of a split, the tree has been diced

41:53.655 --> 41:56.855
into a nice pile of
kindling for Bear Grylls.

41:58.198 --> 42:00.900
The result that we were
looking for for this experiment

42:00.967 --> 42:04.537
was two pieces, one left, one right,
split right down the middle.

42:05.204 --> 42:08.738
What we got was 200 pieces.

42:08.906 --> 42:11.408
The tree shattered all over the forest.

42:11.476 --> 42:12.476
There's bits everywhere.

42:12.943 --> 42:15.647
It turns out the Anfo was just too much,

42:16.015 --> 42:18.184
even at the minimum amount to detonate,

42:18.209 --> 42:20.909
to sustain that crack all
the way to the top.

42:21.652 --> 42:24.121
And that leaves only one conclusion.

42:24.488 --> 42:27.824
All right, no matter how you look
at this myth, this one is busted.

42:27.992 --> 42:28.691
Busted.

42:28.759 --> 42:29.626
Busted.

42:29.693 --> 42:31.995
But at least we have all this
firewood and kindling now.

42:32.031 --> 42:33.931
This isn't a split. This is a shatter.

42:35.899 --> 42:38.768
The tree and the myth are both shattered.

42:38.836 --> 42:42.038
And let's face it, if this
method didn't work,

42:42.063 --> 42:45.163
then a dynamite arrow is
not even a long shot.

42:47.388 --> 42:49.288
All right, I've got some seedlings.

42:49.313 --> 42:50.213
Okay.

42:50.238 --> 42:52.038
The myth might be busted...

42:52.063 --> 42:53.263
Let's do our part.

42:53.288 --> 42:56.488
...but at least the team has given
something back to the forest.

42:56.513 --> 42:58.813
Sort of a strange
MythBusters circle of life.

42:58.838 --> 43:02.138
I think it's a good deal for the
forest, I mean three for one.
