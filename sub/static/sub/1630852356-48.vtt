[Corbyn] <i>If you don't make room</i>

00:02.197 --> 00:05.243
<i>for my soup,
I am going to scream!</i>

00:05.287 --> 00:07.550
[Jayme] <i>
Corbyn, we all have soup
on this table,</i>

00:07.594 --> 00:08.943
<i>there's just no room.</i>

00:08.986 --> 00:10.553
[Corbyn] <i>
Ahh! My soup!</i>

00:10.597 --> 00:12.686
<i>- Ahhhh!
- Corbyn! Grr!</i>

00:12.729 --> 00:14.992
[Announcer] <i>You're watching Snug Lil' Room!</i>

00:15.036 --> 00:17.212
- What is this?!
- Alice! Oh.

00:17.255 --> 00:19.780
- Well, uh... it's...
- [Announcer] <i>Three dozen
young adults</i>

00:19.823 --> 00:22.826
<i>trapped in one extremely
cramped bachelor apartment!</i>

00:22.870 --> 00:26.569
It's a trashy reality show.
I-like-it-don't-judge-me.

00:26.613 --> 00:28.440
So what, it's like a soap opera?

00:28.484 --> 00:31.182
No. It's real. Maybe.

00:31.226 --> 00:32.923
Count me in. Scootch.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.839
- Gladly!
- What on earth are
y'all watchin'?

00:35.883 --> 00:38.581
Some show where everyone's up
in each others biz-nizz!

00:38.625 --> 00:42.063
[sobs] <i>If Marco bumps into me
like one more time...</i>

00:42.106 --> 00:44.979
<i>- Oops.</i>
- [screams] <i>Eat it!</i>

00:45.022 --> 00:47.677
It mostly shows
that people go crazy

00:47.721 --> 00:49.046
when they don't have
their own space.

00:49.070 --> 00:50.637
I dunno, Gloria.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.005
Cricket and I have been
sharing a room

00:52.029 --> 00:53.422
since we were little babies.

00:53.465 --> 00:55.032
- And we're doin' good.
- Yah!

00:55.076 --> 00:57.208
Tilly's easy!
She's like a house plant.

00:57.252 --> 00:58.949
And everyone loves
livin' with Cricket.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.822
He's great! Anyways, goodbye.

01:01.865 --> 01:05.086
I'm gonna go in the yard
and try to ride that goat!

01:05.129 --> 01:08.742
And I am going to entertain
myself quietly in our bedroom.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.352
See? A houseplant.

01:10.395 --> 01:12.702
Now let's get a goat!

01:13.703 --> 01:15.662
What a ridiculous notion.

01:15.705 --> 01:18.055
To think that Cricket
and I, brother and sister,

01:18.099 --> 01:19.970
would ever butt heads!

01:20.014 --> 01:23.060
Clearly our relationship
is as solid and sound

01:23.104 --> 01:24.671
as this house of cards.

01:25.933 --> 01:26.934
Hmm...

01:28.979 --> 01:31.329
Cricket's dang secret entrance.

01:31.373 --> 01:33.941
- [Cricket laughing]
- [Goat bleats angrily.]

01:33.984 --> 01:35.986
Ohh! Aw.

01:36.030 --> 01:39.337
So this is why it's always
so drafty in our room.

01:39.381 --> 01:41.122
Hum?! What was that, Saxon?

01:42.471 --> 01:44.081
Well, I could do that.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.083
Sharing a room should be
about considering

01:46.127 --> 01:47.824
each others needs after all.

01:47.868 --> 01:51.045
And I need it to be
less drafty in here.

01:51.088 --> 01:53.351
[Jayme] <i>
Melanie, if you don't
get out of my chair,</i>

01:53.395 --> 01:55.658
<i>I'll peel you like a grape!</i>

01:55.702 --> 01:59.314
<i>You always say that,
but you never have the...</i>

01:59.357 --> 02:01.098
Ah crud, my brain broke!

02:01.142 --> 02:02.665
No, the cables out.

02:02.709 --> 02:03.971
-Bill?

02:04.014 --> 02:07.017
- Bill!
- [both] Bill!

02:07.061 --> 02:10.368
Hey, you two. I think
the wind knocked out
your cable connection.

02:10.412 --> 02:12.980
Fix it or else I'll peel
you like a grape!

02:13.023 --> 02:16.070
- But... I'm your son!
- [laughs]

02:16.113 --> 02:17.941
Well, I'm glad I can
still make you laugh.

02:17.985 --> 02:20.117
OK. I'll be outside
fixin' the cable.

02:20.161 --> 02:22.511
Heheh... Now what?

02:22.554 --> 02:25.122
There. Stable and harmonious.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.950
- [bang]
- [Cricket] Aw!

02:26.994 --> 02:31.041
-[bang]
-[Cricket moans]
Ah, what the heck?

02:31.085 --> 02:34.566
Who ding danged closed up
the ding dang, aw!

02:34.610 --> 02:38.092
Tilly! Call the police!
Someone boarded up my hole!

02:38.135 --> 02:39.963
I boarded up your hole.

02:40.007 --> 02:42.183
Uh, to help me how?!

02:42.226 --> 02:44.011
Well, I was getting chilly,

02:44.054 --> 02:46.578
and if we are both considerate
of each others needs, then...

02:46.622 --> 02:49.233
Tilly, you don't have
any needs! Right?

02:49.277 --> 02:51.409
Houseplants are
supposed to be easy.

02:51.453 --> 02:54.456
That's you. You're
supposed to be easy!

02:54.499 --> 02:57.938
Grr! I am not a houseplant!

02:57.981 --> 02:59.809
And you are selfish!

02:59.853 --> 03:02.986
Hah? Ha-bah? Wha? Heh? Hah?

03:04.422 --> 03:06.222
How long has it been
since the cable went out?

03:06.250 --> 03:07.861
- Five minutes.
- Gaaah!

03:07.904 --> 03:09.906
I think I'm going through
drama withdrawal!

03:09.950 --> 03:12.039
The pettiness... the politics!

03:12.082 --> 03:13.954
The lying! The screaming!

03:13.997 --> 03:15.912
- The back stabbing!
- The back stabbing!

03:15.956 --> 03:17.784
I never knew how badly I needed

03:17.827 --> 03:20.656
to watch idiots
stuck in a house
fight with each other!

03:20.700 --> 03:22.397
- [Tilly] <i>Well...</i>
- [Cricket] <i>Unbelievable!</i>

03:22.440 --> 03:24.027
- Listen to me for once!
- OK, I'm up to here with you.

03:24.051 --> 03:26.029
- This is my room too!
- You can't just board up...

03:26.053 --> 03:28.011
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

03:28.055 --> 03:30.492
Tilly was just way out
of line. It's my room too,

03:30.535 --> 03:32.929
I should be able to havea secret entrance!

03:32.973 --> 03:34.104
This feels weird.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.411
Oh, no. Just keep
monologuing to us.

03:36.454 --> 03:39.109
You were talkin' about
how upset Tilly made you?

03:39.153 --> 03:42.417
Right! So. Tilly thinksshe
can mess with my stuff,

03:42.460 --> 03:44.462
then I can mess with hers, too.

03:44.506 --> 03:47.161
Today has been a bit
of a wake-up call for Tilly.

03:47.204 --> 03:50.077
After all,
our bedroom belongsto both Cricket and me.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.863
So I should have a sayin whether or
not we shouldhave a hole in the wall.

03:53.907 --> 03:56.648
I feel my only optionis to retaliate.

03:56.692 --> 03:59.521
Ooh-hoo-hoo! A juicy conflict.

03:59.564 --> 04:02.916
Oh, wait. Do your Gramma
duties require you to do
anything about this?

04:02.959 --> 04:05.919
It'll build Character if they
figure it out on their own.

04:05.962 --> 04:08.312
Then retaliate away!

04:08.356 --> 04:10.793
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we're gonna go make popcorn.

04:10.837 --> 04:11.838
[laughing]

04:13.143 --> 04:15.189
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

04:15.232 --> 04:17.800
Well, since you boarded up
my secret entrance,

04:17.844 --> 04:21.717
I figured the new rule is each
of us can do whatever we want.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.329
So I'mma use your fancy
schmancy mirror. Mwah! Mwah!

04:25.373 --> 04:27.941
In that case, I think
I'd like to have Phoenix

04:27.984 --> 04:29.943
sleep by me for a change!

04:29.986 --> 04:33.076
Okay, that's pushing it!
Phoenix always sleeps by me!

04:33.120 --> 04:35.122
She's my dog too, Cricket.

04:35.165 --> 04:37.080
You know I'm starting
to think Gloria was right.

04:37.124 --> 04:40.127
Maybe this tiny room ain't big
enough for the both of us.

04:40.170 --> 04:43.130
- Whatchu tryin' ta say?
- What I'm tryin' ta say is,

04:43.173 --> 04:45.523
there is only one way
to solve this.

04:45.567 --> 04:48.788
- What do you think we missed?
- What in blue blazes?

04:50.006 --> 04:52.487
- [Cricket groans]
- [both groaning]

04:52.530 --> 04:56.186
- You stay outta my half!
- And you stay out of mine! Hum!

04:56.230 --> 04:58.101
Oh, my gosh!

04:58.145 --> 05:00.843
You guys literally split
your room in two!

05:00.887 --> 05:02.845
Wait, why didn't you
divide it in half?

05:02.889 --> 05:04.020
- We did.
- We did.

05:04.064 --> 05:05.979
No, no, like a line
down the center.

05:06.022 --> 05:07.110
Left and right sides?

05:07.154 --> 05:08.590
Gloria, that's ridiculous.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.200
Left and right change
all the time.

05:10.244 --> 05:12.028
This is left, this is right.

05:12.072 --> 05:13.682
Now that's left
and that's right.

05:13.725 --> 05:15.989
And now this is left,
and that's right!

05:16.032 --> 05:17.033
See? No good.

05:17.077 --> 05:19.166
But up and down are always true.

05:19.209 --> 05:21.168
That's crazy.
Am I right, Alice?

05:21.211 --> 05:23.953
Good work, kids.
Makes perfect sense.

05:23.997 --> 05:25.128
Ugh, never mind.

05:25.172 --> 05:27.130
I obviously got the better
end of the deal,

05:27.174 --> 05:28.697
what with the floor and all.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.655
I disagree
because I can do this.

05:32.005 --> 05:33.484
Whee! Ah.

05:33.528 --> 05:35.791
See? Sky dwellers rule.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.619
What?! That's so cool!

05:37.662 --> 05:39.273
[coughs] I mean, lame!

05:39.316 --> 05:40.883
Hey, Tilly, watch this.

05:40.927 --> 05:43.799
It's in your room, now it's not!

05:43.843 --> 05:44.994
It's in your room,
now it's not! Ha-ha!

05:45.018 --> 05:46.802
Really?! Your shoe?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.456
- [groans]
- I'm team Cricket.

05:48.499 --> 05:50.197
- He's funny!
- I'm team Tilly.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.589
She's savage.

05:51.633 --> 05:53.940
Well, at least you're
out of ammo. Aw!

05:53.983 --> 05:55.637
A third shoe?!

05:55.680 --> 05:58.248
Ha-ha! Well, this is fun.
But I need a juice break.

05:59.771 --> 06:01.686
Ahh! Aww.

06:01.730 --> 06:03.427
Oh! Whoopsie!

06:03.471 --> 06:06.039
Did I leave my ba-na-na
in the hallway?

06:06.082 --> 06:08.780
Oh, whoopsie.
Did I leave my lasso

06:08.824 --> 06:10.130
- around your ankle?
- Whoa!

06:10.173 --> 06:12.741
How is a Tilly supposed
to use the hallway

06:12.784 --> 06:14.482
with banana peels lying around?

06:14.525 --> 06:17.093
[spits] And how is
a Cricket supposed to walk

06:17.137 --> 06:19.443
with lassos lying around?

06:19.487 --> 06:23.143
Looks like our problem
is still unresolved!

06:23.186 --> 06:24.666
- Hmmm!
- Hmmm!

06:24.709 --> 06:25.928
- Hmmm?
- Hmmm?

06:25.972 --> 06:29.845
- We split the house!
- We split the house.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.412
Kitchen? Split.

06:31.455 --> 06:34.328
I control the liquid juice.

06:34.371 --> 06:39.028
I actually prefer
frozen juice concentrate.

06:39.072 --> 06:40.943
Livingroom. Split!

06:40.987 --> 06:42.902
[groans, groans]

06:42.945 --> 06:44.816
[whispering]
That's so cool!

06:46.122 --> 06:48.777
Agh! Are you jealous
of my grabbing forks?

06:48.820 --> 06:50.561
Are you jealous of my TV?

06:51.998 --> 06:53.521
Wait, what happened
to the cable?

06:53.564 --> 06:56.263
Bathroom! Yah! Split!

06:56.306 --> 06:58.961
Just close the door.
I can figure this out.

06:59.005 --> 07:00.615
[whistles]

07:00.658 --> 07:03.357
Gramma and Gloria? Split.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.228
I get their heads and faces.

07:05.272 --> 07:06.969
Have fun with butts, Cricket.

07:07.013 --> 07:08.971
Pfft! Joke's on Tilly!

07:09.015 --> 07:10.799
I'll talk to butts! I love it!

07:10.842 --> 07:14.020
Ugh. Anyways,
how are you two doing today?

07:15.238 --> 07:16.500
OK, this stinks.

07:16.544 --> 07:18.589
I'mma do something
about this. Hup!

07:20.026 --> 07:22.506
- [thunder]
- [Bill] Ooh,
that doesn't sound good.

07:22.550 --> 07:24.944
[Cricket]
Gaaaah... Oof! Ugh...

07:24.987 --> 07:27.294
Ha-ha! I got
my secret exit back!

07:27.337 --> 07:29.383
How you likin'
that breeze, Tilly?

07:29.426 --> 07:31.080
Hmph. Two can play these games.

07:31.124 --> 07:33.343
[groans, groans]

07:33.387 --> 07:35.563
Oh man, I thought
the two of you went to bed.

07:35.606 --> 07:37.434
I'm gonna put on
some coffee! BRB!

07:37.478 --> 07:40.002
Uh! Cricket...
Uh. Looks like I...

07:40.046 --> 07:43.049
Uh! Have a secret exit too. Ha!

07:44.093 --> 07:46.008
Oh, look. Rain.

07:46.052 --> 07:47.140
Delicious.

07:47.183 --> 07:50.012
Hey, what's goin on...
haa... Aahh?

07:50.056 --> 07:52.188
What are y'all doin'
to my house?!

07:52.232 --> 07:55.496
I must admit,
I think we letthings get out of hand.

07:55.539 --> 07:57.933
We'll have to stop
exploitingthe the kids for fun.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.935
- And intervene.
- What?!

07:59.979 --> 08:01.154
But we can't stop here!

08:01.197 --> 08:03.243
I need... the drama.

08:03.286 --> 08:06.028
Well, it has to end soon
before my house falls apart.

08:06.072 --> 08:09.162
Don't these show have
like a big finale or something?

08:09.205 --> 08:11.033
Yes, they do.

08:15.211 --> 08:20.086
[coughs] Standing
before me tonight are
two strong contestants.

08:20.129 --> 08:22.697
Cricket, you are selfish
and irresponsible.

08:22.740 --> 08:25.047
And it's nice to see you get
put in your place for once.

08:25.091 --> 08:29.008
I mean, it's true.
But I don't. Take. Criticism.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.968
Tilly, you grew out
of your nice shell
for the sake of justice.

08:33.012 --> 08:36.885
I respect that.
But I'm 99% sure you ate
all of my cherry lip balm.

08:38.539 --> 08:42.064
It's clear that the two of you
can no longer share a space.

08:42.108 --> 08:44.632
So whoever receive
this rose may stay.

08:44.675 --> 08:50.072
The other... must...
pack your bags and leave!

08:50.116 --> 08:51.900
- Wait... Leave?!
- Wait... Leave?!

08:51.943 --> 08:55.512
Yes. Leave. Move out. Scram!

08:55.556 --> 08:57.949
No, hold on. I don't want
Tilly to move out!

08:57.993 --> 09:00.126
And I don't want Cricket
to move out either!

09:00.169 --> 09:03.085
- Aww, ya mean it, Tilly?
- I mean it, brother.

09:03.129 --> 09:06.262
Well, too bad! That's not
how reality TV works!

09:06.306 --> 09:08.612
One of you has
to leave the island!

09:08.656 --> 09:10.484
One of you has to go!

09:10.527 --> 09:13.661
And that person... is...

09:13.704 --> 09:16.664
- [inhales]
- Now hold on one second.

09:16.707 --> 09:20.059
- Ahh!
- What is this?

09:20.102 --> 09:22.104
Whoever gets kicked out
of their room

09:22.148 --> 09:25.455
must live in the basement
with Gloria.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.456
What?!

09:26.500 --> 09:29.242
[sobs] Betrayal.

09:29.285 --> 09:30.895
So go ahead, Gloria.

09:30.939 --> 09:32.245
Choose who has to go.

09:32.288 --> 09:34.508
I didn't know we'd get
to live with Gloria!

09:34.551 --> 09:36.466
Let's both live with Gloria!

09:36.510 --> 09:38.425
- Gloria! Gloria!
- Nooo!

09:38.468 --> 09:42.081
Ugh! Die! Die! Die!
Die, die, die! Die!

09:42.124 --> 09:44.431
It's suddenly occurred
to me that it's wrong

09:44.474 --> 09:47.086
to view real people's
suffering as entertainment.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.044
You guys can keep
sharing your room.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.438
And therefore not sleeping
anywhere near me.

09:51.481 --> 09:53.092
- All right!
- Whoo-hoo!

09:53.135 --> 09:55.094
I'm sorry for calling you
a house plant, Tilly.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.487
We can keep my secret exit
closed if you want.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.924
Well, how about this,
you can keep the secret exit,

09:59.968 --> 10:03.014
and I can hang up
some wind chimes
to enjoy the breeze!

10:03.058 --> 10:04.755
[loud noise]

10:04.799 --> 10:06.322
Guh! Well, I don't love it,

10:06.366 --> 10:08.498
but... it's a fair deal.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.935
Hey, guys! I finally
fixed the cable.

10:10.979 --> 10:12.348
So you can go back
to watching that show.

10:12.372 --> 10:14.156
- It's back!
- Get outta my way!

10:14.200 --> 10:16.550
Wait, is it wrong
to watch reality TV

10:16.593 --> 10:18.160
now that we know
the harm it can cause?

10:18.204 --> 10:20.249
We don't know the people on TV,

10:20.293 --> 10:21.598
so it doesn't count!

10:21.642 --> 10:23.818
[cheer and laugh]

10:23.861 --> 10:27.038
Aw, they must've been
real bored. Hm...?

10:27.082 --> 10:29.171
What on earth happened here?!

10:29.215 --> 10:30.651
