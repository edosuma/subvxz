<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain.

03:16.068 --> 03:20.114

Sir, this is strange.
All the small bottles of vodka is gone.

03:39.841 --> 03:44.513

04:24.384 --> 04:27.887
It was just a dream.

I need a shih tzu to.

05:39.706 --> 05:42.625
Not this time.

05:55.471 --> 06:00.059
This should certainly be free.

06:08.024 --> 06:12.319
I have you. I've got you.

06:24.165 --> 06:27.459
It was unusual.

06:28.211 --> 06:30.961
No.

06:32.047 --> 06:33.923
Perfect.

06:34.675 --> 06:39.096
I do not like labels.
You are my woman. Okay?

06:39.846 --> 06:44.893
- And anal sex is not really sex.
- I want to love only when we are a couple.

06:45.643 --> 06:50.439
- Drink that.
- Ugh, you like kale?

06:51.191 --> 06:55.319
- I've been hurt before.

07:53.500 --> 07:58.129
- Was it good?
- What? I've dealt with worse.

07:58.879 --> 08:03.093
- This is nothing. Do you get it?
- No, slow down.

08:07.639 --> 08:11.141
- The teeth are so sharp!
- Well we had a short break?

08:11.891 --> 08:16.939

- Are we really there?

08:17.689 --> 08:20.692
- Second chances, then?
- You've got six.

08:21.444 --> 08:25.279
- What happened to seven chances?
- Bryan, you are too intense.

08:26.031 --> 08:29.326
Is it? I am intense?

08:30.076 --> 08:32.745
Okay, I'm a little intense.

08:33.496 --> 08:36.792
Money is tender
and has a big... heart.

08:37.543 --> 08:41.837
Is it the only thing that's great?
Where is Kim?

08:42.587 --> 08:46.926
- Not here.
- You're lying. I saw the boy's shoes in the hall.

08:47.676 --> 08:53.389

22:55.317 --> 23:00.529
Heat it to 70 degrees
and corn kernels popped.

23:01.279 --> 23:03.700
Poppa his ass full.

23:04.450 --> 23:07.871
No, Lenore is very sensitive right now.

23:08.621 --> 23:13.584
Okay. Need a place
to shine drown in, let me know.

23:14.334 --> 23:16.502
Thanks, Mom.

23:31.433 --> 23:34.686
Day One at Vialis test.

23:44.445 --> 23:49.201
25 minutes. Nothing. Zero.

23:53.579 --> 23:58.542
Training to increase blood flow.
Nothing.

24:00.211 --> 24:04.089
50 minutes. Still nothing.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.676
<i>The African lion is romantic.</i>

24:08.426 --> 24:12.347
<i>She gets only his vibrant,
magical sword.</i>

24:13.098 --> 24:18.438
<i>He really knows how he
'll show her who's the boss.</i>

24:19.189 --> 24:22.316
<i>See how relaxed he moves his hips.</i>

24:23.066 --> 24:26.069
Ladies and gentlemen, we have lift.

24:57.391 --> 25:00.728
Check it out here.

25:03.690 --> 25:07.107
Oh my God! It is burning!

25:10.319 --> 25:14.740
<i>We broadcast live from the Village Square
where an enormous fire be fought.</i>

25:15.826 --> 25:21.122
- We have to get out! Now!
- No!

25:23.333 --> 25:27.420
<i>We are waiting for details on how the fire started
. We interview him.</i>

25:28.171 --> 25:33.092
<i>- Backa. Backa.
- I'm a hero!</i>

25:33.842 --> 25:38.013
<i>Excuse me, how the fire started?</i>

25:39.472 --> 25:41.892
<i>Did you see anything?</i>

25:42.643 --> 25:46.270
<i>- What were you doing when the fire broke out?
- I do not really know.</i>

25:47.021 --> 25:52.943
The plan failed.
We'll get him next time, I promise.

25:53.694 --> 25:58.450
I will not disappoint you.

26:04.538 --> 26:09.961
Kim, your favorite, vanilla.
Lenore, they had unfortunately not chocolate.

26:10.711 --> 26:12.296
Why did you want to be seen?

26:13.047 --> 26:17.884
Dad, there's a party over the weekend.
My friends go, I want too.

26:18.634 --> 26:22.638
- Your daughter wants to go out.
- If the parents are there?

26:23.390 --> 26:30.229
- No, it's a college party.
- Absolutely not. I know how guys think.

26:31.689 --> 26:34.858
This party is so cruel.

26:35.608 --> 26:39.239
College Girls are so stylish.

26:39.989 --> 26:45.786
We're looking up virgins there
and fuck them.

26:46.537 --> 26:50.915
Okay, you may not
accompany us out anymore.

26:51.666 --> 26:54.627
He does not even kidding. Go to hell.

26:55.378 --> 27:00.467
Bryan. Your daughter is searching for contact.

27:01.217 --> 27:05.096
Are you going to eat or to have it
around the mouth like a whore?

27:05.846 --> 27:10.309
- Any thought that.
- You're ruining my life.

27:13.645 --> 27:15.814
I just took a bite.

27:16.565 --> 27:20.111
I thought you had changed.
You can not live in fear forever.

27:20.861 --> 27:25.906
You've lost me. Do not lose her.
Let Kim go to the party.

27:47.010 --> 27:50.765
What do you want?

27:52.308 --> 27:57.770
Kim, I've thought about it.
You get to go to the party.

27:58.521 --> 28:03.192
On one condition. They follow you.

28:03.943 --> 28:07.488
- No.
- Okay. In one condition.

28:08.239 --> 28:11.826
That I bug you and monitor you
from a van outside.

28:12.576 --> 28:15.413
- No.
- In one condition.

28:16.163 --> 28:20.251
That you have this chastity belt
you. It is a good chastity belt.

28:21.001 --> 28:25.964
I did it in a camp to escape
become sodomiserad. Do you know what it is?

28:26.715 --> 28:30.594
- I try to compromise.
- How about this?

28:31.345 --> 28:35.847
- You will drive me to the party.
- Sure.

28:36.599 --> 28:41.855
- So, we eat birthday dinner together.
- Yes! Thanks, Dad!

28:49.193 --> 28:52.949
Thank you, Bryan.

29:02.834 --> 29:07.546
Is it a college party? It looks for quiet
out to be a celebration. Are you honest?

29:08.297 --> 29:13.259
Yes, Dad. Thank you.

29:17.596 --> 29:21.518
- Kim, honey. Have you tear gas?
- Yes, father.

29:22.268 --> 29:26.897
- If you have electrical gun?
- Yes.

29:32.359 --> 29:36.824
- Call me at midnight.
- Dad!

29:39.159 --> 29:43.204
- Honey, why does it take time?
- I put on something more comfortable.

29:43.955 --> 29:48.000
Hurry,
I have to let stuff unfold.

29:53.756 --> 29:56.759
What...

30:01.930 --> 30:04.976
- What do you do?
- You like it?

30:05.727 --> 30:10.690
I'm a vegan. Look at the tattoos.
Did you think I was kidding?

30:11.441 --> 30:16.693
Have you seen how they treat
chickens? Tilapia get chicken feces.

30:17.444 --> 30:20.198
Therefore, we can not even eat tilapia.

30:20.949 --> 30:24.911
Take your chicken suit.
It is not sexy.

30:25.662 --> 30:29.207
I'm trying to... what was it?

30:30.290 --> 30:33.794
- Is Kim at home already?
- Can you go and check?

30:34.546 --> 30:39.217
- I'll be right.
- I'll wait here. Change to something edible.

30:39.968 --> 30:46.432
A tempeh-roll, a samosa.
Or a potato, damn. Or curry.

30:48.016 --> 30:50.936
Bryan, what the hell are you doing?

30:51.686 --> 30:55.273
There is something wrong with the party.
Kim hiding something.

30:56.022 --> 30:59.944
You're just paranoid. There is no danger,
it is completely innocent.

31:00.695 --> 31:04.700
- They hand them out at school.
- Lubricant.

31:05.450 --> 31:09.371
Yes, to moisturize hands.

31:11.538 --> 31:16.919
- This is mine.
- It's bigger than my forearm.

31:19.087 --> 31:24.759
- P-pills were to Kim!
- Do not overreact. They amuse themselves only.

31:25.509 --> 31:31.849
- Bryan, you make yourself a laughing stock!
- Lenore, you're dressed chicken.

31:32.601 --> 31:36.771
What the hell?
George Washington and Napoleon smoked grass.

31:37.522 --> 31:40.607
- What?
- It is proven.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.693
Can anyone put on Kenny G?

31:44.444 --> 31:49.701
He is lovely. He gave a lock of hair
to an African of crowdfunding.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.618
Oops.

31:52.369 --> 31:58.084
- Do you think... What's up?
- There, there, buddy. Good luck.

32:01.586 --> 32:05.715
- Did you notice? What the hell?
- Calm.

32:06.464 --> 32:09.510
Hey, girls.

32:13.472 --> 32:17.852
- I like your balls.
- Thanks.

32:21.021 --> 32:24.650
- Jamie?
- Yes?

32:25.401 --> 32:29.696
I want to make love to you tonight.

32:30.865 --> 32:34.534
- Tonight?
- Yes.

32:35.285 --> 32:40.748
It's not that I do not want to,
but your father scares me.

32:42.459 --> 32:46.046
Do not worry about him.

32:46.797 --> 32:51.174
It's just the two of us tonight.

32:56.013 --> 33:00.768
- Hello?
- Kim, hear. Your innocence is in danger.

33:01.519 --> 33:05.438
- Dad!
- Can I talk to your father?

33:06.189 --> 33:11.027
Why did not the condom on you?
I do not know who you are or what you want.

33:11.778 --> 33:16.865
If you intend to make my daughter pregnant
and live on the family so do you wrong.

33:17.615 --> 33:22.455
I have no money, but
a specific set of skills.

33:23.205 --> 33:26.375
Skills who took time to devel-

33:27.126 --> 33:31.546
- That make me a nightmare
of craps you.

33:32.297 --> 33:34.924
Release my daughter, it's over.

33:35.675 --> 33:39.221
Otherwise, I will seek you-

33:39.971 --> 33:44.852
-Find You and kill you.

33:47.144 --> 33:48.564
I hate you!

33:49.314 --> 33:51.900
- Oh my God.
- Your nose is so fine.

33:52.651 --> 33:57.239
I know. The doctor said I
can touch it in two weeks.

33:59.990 --> 34:02.951
My nose !

34:03.702 --> 34:07.164
- Where is my daughter Kim?
- What grade are you in?

34:07.914 --> 34:12.170
- Come on, calm down.
- Do you smoke marijuana?

34:12.920 --> 34:19.092
It's like that behavior
which keeps the country in stupidity.

34:21.052 --> 34:24.681
I'm looking for my daughter Kim.
Where is she?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.306
I do not know.

34:28.059 --> 34:32.063
- Where is she?
- Up there.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.445
Sorry. Pardon!

34:40.197 --> 34:44.199
You must go home. This is bad.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.960
Two holes remain. Check.

34:55.710 --> 35:01.298
It's not safe. Hyscha me.
It has not felt good since...

35:02.050 --> 35:07.181
- Kim?
- Sir, wait!

35:17.188 --> 35:23.403
You deserve it!
You tried to exploit my daughter!

35:24.153 --> 35:27.239
She is so damn cute!

35:28.699 --> 35:32.661
- I won!
- I think he's dead.

35:33.414 --> 35:38.376
- He does not look so bad.
- He's only sensation in the nose.

35:39.126 --> 35:44.090
I thought you had changed.
Do not come near us for a while.

35:44.840 --> 35:49.012
- Not until Kim's birthday.
- I understand.

35:49.762 --> 35:52.639
Sorry, Kim.

36:04.777 --> 36:08.195
- Now you can get your pussy.
- I slaughter you, hang pattering!

36:08.947 --> 36:13.452
- Who hängpattar?
- Go to hell, bitch.

36:17.289 --> 36:21.166
- What? Not now, Bryan.
- I need help, Mom.

36:21.916 --> 36:24.753
- I'm busy.
- I have to get back Lenore.

36:25.503 --> 36:29.884
- We have talked about it.
- I'm not going to kill him.

36:30.635 --> 36:35.472
- Do not be such a coward. Fuck you down.
- What?

36:36.222 --> 36:40.684
I have an idea.
Meet me here at 05:00.

36:41.436 --> 36:44.690
You little bastard!

36:48.192 --> 36:52.362
- This live Money.
- I plant bugs. Guard them.

36:53.114 --> 36:55.992
Let me know when they come back.

36:59.286 --> 37:04.123
- Radio Test.
<i>- Acknowledged.</i>

37:10.172 --> 37:14.300
THE NAKED bazooka

37:15.052 --> 37:19.097
8-MILSBALLEN

37:19.847 --> 37:25.018
Dick on Wall Street

37:28.356 --> 37:34.027
- You must not pay for everything.
- What have I said? Porn pays.

37:34.777 --> 37:38.532
- Gay porn pays even better.
<i>- You make me so happy.</i>

37:39.282 --> 37:42.536
<i>Now we go home and feed the fish.</i>

38:00.552 --> 38:05.724
I just drank wheat grass.
You will love the taste.

38:06.976 --> 38:10.855
- Money, we must reassure us.
- Yes, suck my cock a little, just.

38:11.605 --> 38:15.983
- What?
- Nothing. We're supposed to get married.

38:16.735 --> 38:20.864
I know, but I need more time.
Understand.

38:21.614 --> 38:26.577
Okay, okay.
I will call for a car for you.

38:28.036 --> 38:32.375
You. Moneymaker. I have one more.

38:41.425 --> 38:45.096
Hello? Hey. No, she just left.

38:45.847 --> 38:50.768
No, not even a handjob.
We'll see. She gets up to two weeks.

38:51.518 --> 38:58.273
Releasing she did not so she goes out.
Yes, I thought the ring would help.

38:59.900 --> 39:06.240
If I'm getting married? Are you kidding?
I have a girl in every state.

39:06.992 --> 39:12.454
I'm talking about when I put it on her.
I turn on FaceTime over time.

39:13.204 --> 39:16.876
As last time. All right.
I love you dad.

39:17.626 --> 39:21.505
I knew he was a creep.

39:22.715 --> 39:28.387
It's so fun to have the whole family
gathered at Kim's birthday.

39:29.137 --> 39:32.099
Jamie, it's great that you're here.

39:32.849 --> 39:36.978
A spine injury may feel horrible,
but they heal.

39:37.728 --> 39:41.483
Congratulations, Kim.

39:42.233 --> 39:46.028
Hi, honey.

39:47.280 --> 39:53.409
- Money, what fun you came.
- Bryan, that's okay?

39:54.161 --> 39:59.583
- Sure.
- Kim, this is your birthday present.

40:02.210 --> 40:05.172
A book about a beautiful girl like you.

40:05.922 --> 40:07.965
Kim, I had too little time.

40:08.715 --> 40:12.387
I wrote a book about you.

40:13.137 --> 40:16.224
Congratulations, girl.

40:16.974 --> 40:20.351
How about cake?
I asked them to write your name on it.

40:21.103 --> 40:26.568
This was embarrassing.
I also had to make a cake for you.

40:29.320 --> 40:33.949
- Oh my God, it's incredible.
- Congratulations on the birth-day.

40:34.699 --> 40:40.038
Kim, I forgot the most important thing.
You get a card.

40:43.291 --> 40:46.920
Oh, it plays music. Thanks, Dad.

40:47.670 --> 40:53.759
Kim, I could not buy a card,
but a friend will sing for you.

40:56.219 --> 41:00.557
Akon
It is Kim's birthday.

41:02.518 --> 41:05.813
I want to eat your cake.

41:06.563 --> 41:11.610
And get glaze in my face.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.655
It tastes so good.

41:16.405 --> 41:21.369
I have a present for you
I know what you like.

41:22.119 --> 41:26.208
Receiving cock
Receive your dick.

41:26.958 --> 41:31.045
Receiving cock.

41:31.795 --> 41:36.592
Receiving cock
Receive your dick.

41:37.342 --> 41:39.804
Subba.

41:40.554 --> 41:44.766
- Yes. Kid.
- I have to stick to a bar mitzvah.

41:45.516 --> 41:50.313
- Schyst.
- Where's my juice?

41:51.440 --> 41:55.402
Here you have wheatgrass
and this is beetroot.

41:56.152 --> 42:00.782
- Remember, the wheat before the beta.
- Green before sweets.

42:01.532 --> 42:07.371
- Have you left colonic contact?
- Yes, we can run a game together.

42:08.123 --> 42:12.710
Not together, in different rooms.
You are not blacker than I!

42:15.170 --> 42:18.590
- I have to pee.
- I have to help Jamie.

42:19.340 --> 42:23.262
- What?
- Bryan. Go ye.

42:24.012 --> 42:28.974
- It's your fault that he is bandaged.
- Will she take on his...

42:29.726 --> 42:35.356
No. The poor have a catheter.
Feels better if I help him?

42:37.150 --> 42:42.028
Holy shit. Hey, pink hottie.

42:42.780 --> 42:46.032
What very vanilla. Like chocolate?

42:46.784 --> 42:51.539
They have T-bone steak. You can get
a real T-bone steak at your home.

42:52.289 --> 42:58.293
I, you, a green Lamborghini,
a kålsmoothie your home.

42:59.045 --> 43:04.842
- Examine your ass. How about it?
- Can you handle this?

43:05.592 --> 43:11.431
Well... Hell, yeah.

43:12.182 --> 43:17.021
- Can I take your plates?
- No, I'm not done yet.

43:17.773 --> 43:21.818
- We take the plates.
- I'm finished.

43:22.568 --> 43:26.405
- Here we go. Rapidly.
- Move it.

43:27.155 --> 43:31.201
- I want to play with it.
- Please, be careful.

43:34.829 --> 43:40.251
- Come on!
- Now, Mom!

43:42.045 --> 43:46.382
What the hell?
Do not let him get away.

43:48.719 --> 43:51.637
Faster!

43:52.387 --> 43:55.516
Beware!

44:01.396 --> 44:02.940
Holy shit!

44:03.690 --> 44:06.777
Run!

44:10.572 --> 44:13.409
They go the other way!

44:14.159 --> 44:18.413
When I stop, you go on foot. Go
furthest away in the alley and turn right.

44:19.164 --> 44:22.916
Go eight meters, turn left.
There is a patisserie with good struvor.

44:23.668 --> 44:28.422
Cross Grand Street, walk one block.
Take Bueller Street and turn right.

44:29.172 --> 44:32.467
Then you are right across the street
from Jamie and Kim.

44:33.217 --> 44:37.514
Take them home and await instructions.
Understand?

44:38.264 --> 44:42.978
- Did you talk to me?
- Lenore, I have no time!

44:43.728 --> 44:46.190
Stick, girls.

44:46.940 --> 44:51.485
- What should you do?
- What I do best.

44:52.235 --> 44:55.614
Fan.

45:00.494 --> 45:03.454
What? Oh well.

45:10.503 --> 45:15.925

45:16.675 --> 45:23.016

45:45.494 --> 45:51.041
- Daddy, I'm scared.
- Leave a tip, but not more than 15%.

45:51.793 --> 45:55.630
- Potato came late.
- What do I do next?

45:56.382 --> 45:59.717
Go home to me
and await instructions.

46:00.467 --> 46:03.219
Do not ask questions. Go only.

46:03.972 --> 46:07.391
Are you ready?

46:15.065 --> 46:17.693
No!

46:24.449 --> 46:29.704
Well, Mr Bryan Miller.
You know I'm the boss.

46:30.454 --> 46:36.628
But sometimes in life
have even boss is a boss.

46:46.387 --> 46:50.349
- Who are you and what do you want?
- I'm known as Brown finger.

46:51.099 --> 46:55.353
- Mr Brown Finger?
- Only Brown finger.

46:56.103 --> 47:00.108
- Please, let my family.
- No worries, they will do.

47:00.858 --> 47:06.157
- Do you want something? Ost? Biscuits? Tab-Cola?
- Have you Tab?

47:06.907 --> 47:10.534
- I stocked.
- Thanks for the offer, that's fine.

47:11.284 --> 47:16.123
- Lenore, Mom. Do you want something?
- A Tab would be fantastic.

47:16.875 --> 47:21.961
Two Tab, thanks. They are for the guests!

47:22.711 --> 47:28.219
Well, for one thing. You are here
so I can tell my evil plan.

47:28.969 --> 47:34.432
Later you can try to stop me
from killing you, your family...

47:35.184 --> 47:38.561
-... And the thousands of innocents.
- Yeah.

47:39.311 --> 47:44.900
But first I will tell you my background.
As a little boy I had no money.

47:45.652 --> 47:51.657
My father left us nothing.
I had no playmates.

47:52.407 --> 47:57.871
The worst thing is that I think
mom really wanted a girl.

47:58.623 --> 48:02.376
- "How did I know it" you ask?
- I did not ask.

48:03.126 --> 48:09.465
She worked in a rich family
who had a girl my age.

48:10.215 --> 48:12.552
She was so spoiled!

48:13.304 --> 48:18.556
She came home and talked about the girl
as if she were her own.

48:19.307 --> 48:21.393
Will toe bones today?

48:22.144 --> 48:27.567
One day I was playing in the alley
behind our apartment.

48:28.317 --> 48:33.864
I was completely alone. I found
a little dog who was also alone.

48:34.614 --> 48:37.867
He was homeless and became my family.

48:38.619 --> 48:44.583
The dog was just like me. We came
close to each other, we needed each other.

48:45.335 --> 48:48.920
We became best friends.
Dog meant everything to me.

48:49.670 --> 48:54.134
- One day togdes he from me.
- Togs, you mean?

48:54.885 --> 48:57.512
- Togdes.
- That's wrong.

48:58.262 --> 49:04.518
Quiet! My mother took my best friend
and gave a spoiled brat.

49:05.268 --> 49:10.815
If you have not gotten over it yet?
The guy is a jerk.

49:11.567 --> 49:14.985
Look, who do not receive any Tab.

49:19.114 --> 49:22.284
I decided to get revenge.

49:23.036 --> 49:28.208
I saved everything I earned
and started Puppy Empire.

49:28.958 --> 49:32.711
We are selling most puppies in town.

49:33.463 --> 49:37.342
- This makes me happy. Do you know why?
- Why?

49:38.092 --> 49:44.889
Because I have stopped the explosives
in the ass all the dogs I have sold!

49:47.059 --> 49:51.271
- A birthmark.
- You blew my dog.

49:52.021 --> 49:55.525
- You are sick.
- No, I work with my feelings.

49:56.277 --> 49:59.653
I am very angry. It just gets better-

50:00.405 --> 50:05.869
- If I spoiled kids'
best friends. It is for my sake.

50:06.619 --> 50:12.958
You lost a dog, so why
blow your dogs and killing them?

50:13.708 --> 50:16.670
There is someone who listens.

50:17.420 --> 50:22.134
- It's the wrong way to handle it.
- You are not the boss of me.

50:22.885 --> 50:25.260
Say goodbye to our little friend.

50:26.012 --> 50:30.976
No! No! No! No!

50:39.650 --> 50:42.527
Well. A dud.

50:43.820 --> 50:48.324
- There are certain your lucky day.
- Nothing you do is logical.

50:49.076 --> 50:53.204
You are a weird person with
a poo-like birthmark.

50:53.954 --> 50:59.001
You have no reason to take me
and my family. You should let us.

50:59.753 --> 51:04.007
But if you do not release us,
so we hold.

51:04.757 --> 51:09.387
We will find you and kill you.

51:12.974 --> 51:16.936
You are just a guardian,
, you are in deep water.

51:17.686 --> 51:21.273
- I have skills.
- Not according Linkedln.

51:22.023 --> 51:24.400
What is the "Spanish medium-level"?

51:25.152 --> 51:30.742
I can find the toilet,
a police station or a taco-car.

51:31.492 --> 51:35.036
I was just hungry. Just now.

51:35.786 --> 51:41.416
I'm going to make a sandwich.
Think of all that I have said.

51:42.168 --> 51:46.130
Dalmat, take the girls to another room.
When I comes back

51:46.882 --> 51:49.259
-Do I what I want with Bryan.

51:50.009 --> 51:55.014
- Someone may taste corn.
- Mom.

52:11.655 --> 52:17.494
Yes, it was... it was... I...
It was the first time ever.

52:18.244 --> 52:22.789
- There is a bus...
- Whatever. You little prick.

52:23.541 --> 52:28.128
Small? No, but yours was great.
Bigger than mine.

53:09.668 --> 53:14.715
- Dad?
<i>- Listen. Download portfolio on the couch.</i>

53:15.465 --> 53:17.717
I have it.

53:18.467 --> 53:23.181
<i>In it lies a lot of weapons
and a red bag.</i>

53:23.931 --> 53:28.393
<i>- Come here with your bag.</i>
- I do not know where you are.

53:29.144 --> 53:32.940
No, damn it. All right.

53:33.690 --> 53:40.532
Take a grenade from the portfolio.
Go to the window and throw the grenade.

53:43.074 --> 53:48.164
Kim? Kim? Hey Girl. Do you know...

53:48.914 --> 53:53.001
I came back to the restaurant,
but you had gone.

53:59.382 --> 54:04.719
You are 9.3 kilometers
east or west of the...

54:06.139 --> 54:11.184
Puppy Empire. I'm in the mall
in some kind of basement.

54:11.936 --> 54:16.690
Come here with the red bag.
Call when you are here.

54:17.440 --> 54:21.152
- Come on, Jamie! We have to go!
- Kim...

54:21.903 --> 54:25.447
Kim ! Kim!

54:26.784 --> 54:30.079
Yourselves at home, ladies.

54:30.829 --> 54:35.333
Wait. I've been around long enough
to know what men want.

54:36.083 --> 54:40.295
- Edna, what do you do?
- Ignore her.

54:41.047 --> 54:45.842
- How about an orgy?
- What sickening.

54:46.594 --> 54:50.764
Do not pretend like you do not want.

54:51.516 --> 54:56.686
Your friends can also participate.
I pick out his false teeth.

54:57.436 --> 55:02.693
Get silently at her.
Put gag on them.

55:07.112 --> 55:10.699
<i>- Yeah, who is it?</i>
- Dieter.

55:11.451 --> 55:17.748
<i>- What diets?</i>
- It is locked. Are you kind and open?

55:33.014 --> 55:36.224
What the...

55:38.268 --> 55:41.063
Kidding you?

55:43.148 --> 55:46.902
Money? Money,
, you will not believe what happened!

55:47.652 --> 55:52.699
You threw a grenade
and blew away my thumb.

55:53.449 --> 55:59.746
- Sorry.
- Where is the course. Do not worry, I have it.

56:00.498 --> 56:05.795
Help me. My family is taken.
I have to take the bag to my dad.

56:06.545 --> 56:11.007
- Can you drive me?
- If I may take you on the butt.

56:14.594 --> 56:19.349
Wait, Kim! No! Wait! Come on!

56:22.226 --> 56:24.353
What the...

56:46.331 --> 56:49.920
Sorry, wrong room.

56:56.800 --> 56:59.469
I made it.

57:20.907 --> 57:24.869
You, we'll go to the hospital.
I'm getting dizzy.

57:25.621 --> 57:30.373
It can wait. It applies to people's lives.
Come on!

57:31.583 --> 57:34.753
"Come on!"

57:36.880 --> 57:40.385
We have to find my father.
Go that way, I go that way.

57:41.135 --> 57:43.137
Push on!

57:43.887 --> 57:50.519
"Go that way, I go that way."
Go where you want, I'll go this way.

57:53.688 --> 57:59.277
- Dad.
- Did you bring your bag? How well.

58:01.237 --> 58:04.617
- I shit on me.
- You have a bag with underwear?

58:05.367 --> 58:10.288
It is important in my profession. I learn shit
at me several times before it's over.

58:11.039 --> 58:16.543
- Anar you how many I fight?
- Dad, keep some things for yourself.

58:17.295 --> 58:22.675
Courage is not to feel fear,
without the ability to overcome rädslan-

58:23.425 --> 58:26.219
- And do what is needed.
As soon as you arrived.

58:26.969 --> 58:30.264
- Money drove me.
- Is Moneymaker here?

58:31.016 --> 58:37.773
- We split up. He's here.
- I will fix it. Now you have to help me.

58:40.608 --> 58:45.320
Lenore? What the hell? Where the hell are we?

58:46.739 --> 58:52.284
- Money, what happened to your thumb?
- I lost it for your sake.

58:53.036 --> 58:57.458
- You are so nice.
- It's the wrong time.

58:58.208 --> 59:00.710
How is Edna?

59:01.461 --> 59:06.465
- Can we stand, you idiot?
- She is fine.

59:08.675 --> 59:12.222
- Can we go now?
- No, we are firmly linked.

59:12.972 --> 59:19.186
I'll get something to rid yourself of.
Then I will have your ass?

59:19.938 --> 59:22.398
Okay.

59:23.148 --> 59:28.278
- What did you think I should do?
- It is the dogs' only salvation.

59:29.530 --> 59:32.824
I do it.

59:36.744 --> 59:40.206
Okay, relax.

59:48.172 --> 59:51.717
Oh my God. There was a.

59:59.432 --> 01:00:04.105
Yes, damn it. The first attempt.

01:00:07.565 --> 01:00:12.320
- Hands up.
- Come on now.

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:19.077
Ouch! You bastard!

01:00:19.827 --> 01:00:25.208
- Kim, you had to hold him tight.
- I do after all that!

01:00:29.878 --> 01:00:33.882
Kim, listen carefully. Go out and sit
in Moneymaker's car.

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:39.471
Lock the doors, call the police
and tell them to hurry up here.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:54.360
Money! What happened to your hand?

01:00:55.110 --> 01:01:01.909
It is gone, but I got the bastard.
I will take you from here.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:12.878
Money, you can not.
Find something better. Think.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:18.132
- Okay! What should I do?
- Find something else.

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:23.179
- I'll get something else.
- Hurry up.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:33.773
Why do I do it for little white ass?
She lets not even go to.

01:01:34.523 --> 01:01:39.528
Fucking Internet.
Fucking fraudsters to mendacious subbor.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.074
I got rid of the thumb and hand.

01:01:43.824 --> 01:01:49.454
I would have dated a black girl.
Forgive me, black women!

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:54.251
Okay. Be a man. Find something better.

01:01:55.001 --> 01:01:59.422
I find something better.
What the hell is that?

01:02:00.172 --> 01:02:05.887
I have to find something. OK OK.

01:02:13.186 --> 01:02:16.438
Yes, damn it!

01:02:17.856 --> 01:02:21.527
Ouch! No! God damnit!

01:02:22.777 --> 01:02:27.615
My fucking clock!

01:02:28.365 --> 01:02:32.954
Absolutely incredible! Check my fucking arm!

01:02:33.706 --> 01:02:37.666
My fucking arm!

01:02:47.844 --> 01:02:53.181
Hello? I make a sandwich,
I told you not to call me.

01:04:01.498 --> 01:04:05.250
- A seaweed!
- What happened to your arm?

01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:10.713
I do not want to talk about it.

01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:17.387
Idiots.
I had a knife in his pocket all the time.

01:04:18.137 --> 01:04:25.061
- Why did you say nothing?
- Can we go now, please?

01:04:27.648 --> 01:04:31.858
What are you doing? It was my sandwich.

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.028
Sorry, boss. I make a new one.

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.702
I do not want a new one. I make them
my way. It was perfect.

01:04:41.452 --> 01:04:46.998
There was a delicious snack.
What was it crisp?

01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:51.920
What crunchy?

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:58.717
Bingo.

01:05:06.768 --> 01:05:11.981
- Bryan.
- Lenore. You miss your forearm.

01:05:12.731 --> 01:05:17.695
- Yes. Is he always so witty?
- Where is Kim?

01:05:18.445 --> 01:05:22.782
- She would wait in Money's car.
- In my car?

01:05:42.802 --> 01:05:45.804
Someone is going to get beat.

01:05:46.554 --> 01:05:50.893
- Where the hell is my car?
- She may have taken help.

01:05:53.813 --> 01:05:58.483
Hey, y'all. I bought the coffee.

01:05:59.233 --> 01:06:03.989
- Oh, what is good.
- Grandma, chai tea with almond milk.

01:06:04.739 --> 01:06:08.702
Dad, decaffeinated coffee.
Mom, double espresso.

01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:13.164
Money, karma-frappuccino
with extra whipped.

01:06:13.914 --> 01:06:16.501
Thank you, girl.

01:06:17.251 --> 01:06:22.672
- Oh, no.
- Backa, I got it.

01:06:23.422 --> 01:06:29.179
It was just as well. He was not
right for you. You need to hear this.

01:06:31.264 --> 01:06:35.353
<i>- Day One at Vialis test.</i>
- Not there.

01:06:36.103 --> 01:06:39.105
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have lift.</i>

01:06:39.856 --> 01:06:43.985
<i>Yes, I have tickled before thighs.
No, I can not get to.</i>

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:51.701
<i>If I'm getting married? Are you kidding?
I have a girl in every state.</i>

01:06:53.869 --> 01:06:58.541
- I'm sorry you have to hear it.
- No, it was probably just as well.

01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:02.545
Mom!

01:07:03.295 --> 01:07:07.507
- You are sexy as hell, you know?
- Do you like my ass?

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:13.346
It's like a hammock
full of grapefruit. Come here.

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:18.268
- There he told me.
- He said the same thing to me.

01:07:19.019 --> 01:07:23.481
- You guys are just jealous.
- Warm Me, Big Chocolate.

01:07:24.231 --> 01:07:29.945
- Come, sexbomb.
- Now we take care of your enormous shaft.

01:07:30.695 --> 01:07:33.907
That was unexpected.

01:07:34.657 --> 01:07:38.454
- The thing.
- Sorry!

01:07:39.204 --> 01:07:44.918
- Are not you...
- Death? No. But you ruined my plan.

01:07:45.668 --> 01:07:51.007
And you killed my Albanian friend.
Now you will pay. Bring them in.

01:08:11.235 --> 01:08:14.947
Good luck.

01:08:23.246 --> 01:08:29.961
Kim. Lenore. Listen carefully now.
Its over.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:36.091
I have no gun. I am old
and look bad. It's over.

01:08:36.841 --> 01:08:41.971
You sold, but only when you
have been raped and tortured.

01:08:42.721 --> 01:08:46.768
I will be killed by this tokfan.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.149
It's so fucking screwed.

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:57.404
Okay, I...

01:09:09.747 --> 01:09:14.752
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:51.913
Thanks!

01:10:44.756 --> 01:10:47.509
Ouch!

01:11:04.899 --> 01:11:11.030
- I always wanted to die like this.
- This feels uncomfortable.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:15.327
And good. Is that weird?

01:11:25.795 --> 01:11:29.298
I'm so proud of you.

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.393
- This I put up.
- Kim, take no...

01:11:43.938 --> 01:11:50.193
- Bryan, is everything okay?
- I had such a strange dream.

01:11:52.237 --> 01:11:55.448
- Mother.
- Hello, darling.

01:11:56.198 --> 01:11:59.118
What's up, B? Location?

01:11:59.869 --> 01:12:05.039
- Oh my God, it was no dream.
- Bryan?

01:12:05.791 --> 01:12:10.753
I need to go to the bathroom. Sorry.

01:12:14.466 --> 01:12:19.762
- Flight plane! Flights planet!
- Dad!

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:24.350
Hello, Mr Miller.
