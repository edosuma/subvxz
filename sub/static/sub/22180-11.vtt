two parents directly
affected by this ban.

11:25.065 --> 11:27.833
Please, tell us about your son.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.468
Nikolai was born

11:29.469 --> 11:31.437
with Leber congenital amaurosis,

11:31.438 --> 11:32.771
a genetic defect

11:32.772 --> 11:36.308
that causes retinal degeneration
and eventual blindness.

11:36.309 --> 11:38.410
PETER: There's an
experimental gene therapy

11:38.411 --> 11:40.145
that could cure him,
but it's only available

11:40.146 --> 11:42.915
in the United States, so the fact

11:42.916 --> 11:44.416
that we can't take care of him...

11:44.417 --> 11:47.152
It... it breaks our hearts.

11:47.153 --> 11:48.621
NEWSWOMAN: Were you encouraged

11:48.622 --> 11:50.646
- by the vice president's remarks today?
- PETER: We were.

11:50.647 --> 11:52.958
It's nice to hear common sense
coming out of a politician.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.063
Her office has been in touch

11:55.064 --> 11:57.085
- with us throughout the process.
- (PHONE RINGS)

11:57.403 --> 11:59.222
- I'll bet they have.
- STEVIE: Hello?

11:59.223 --> 12:01.133
Can't Conrad tell her
to stay in her lane?

12:01.134 --> 12:03.535
He thought it would be
better to close ranks.

12:03.536 --> 12:05.037
We'll see how Russia reacts.

12:05.038 --> 12:06.705
- STEVIE: Mom?
- Yeah.

12:06.706 --> 12:08.073
Jay is here to see you.

12:08.074 --> 12:11.176
Thank you.

12:11.177 --> 12:13.746
(SIGHS) Shouldn't you be passed out

12:13.747 --> 12:15.087
with a kid's book over
your face right now?

12:15.088 --> 12:17.082
Sorry for the intrusion, ma'am.
But this is sensitive.

12:17.083 --> 12:20.085
I just spoke to Sofia Martinez,

12:20.086 --> 12:21.453
that reporter at the <i>Chronicle.</i>

12:21.454 --> 12:23.989
I've had... contact
with her in the past.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.925
Oh, I remember.

12:25.926 --> 12:28.360
Anyway, Teresa Hurst

12:28.361 --> 12:29.995
is trying to raise her profile

12:29.996 --> 12:31.297
for a presidential campaign.

12:31.298 --> 12:33.132
Sofia got a tip from
her chief of staff

12:33.133 --> 12:35.367
that it would be worth her
while to ask that question

12:35.368 --> 12:36.602
about the adoptees.

12:36.603 --> 12:38.270
The whole thing was staged?

12:38.271 --> 12:39.571
Including the follow-up.

12:39.572 --> 12:41.640
They fed her the exact wording.

12:41.641 --> 12:43.809
The VP is playing us.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.844
And going rogue on foreign policy.

12:45.845 --> 12:48.047
Why?

12:48.048 --> 12:50.115
Because she sees you as a rival.

12:50.116 --> 12:54.052
And... ma'am, she's
trying to take you out.

12:57.389 --> 13:04.670
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

13:08.722 --> 13:11.324
- Could you go get Marcus for me, please?
- Mm-hmm.

13:11.325 --> 13:12.914
Madam Secretary, if you'll
just wait a minute...

13:12.915 --> 13:15.962
- We need to talk.
- Sounds good. All right.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.964
I'll have my office
contact you. Thank you.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.300
Do you have an appointment?

13:20.301 --> 13:23.436
I know you staged that Q and A

13:23.437 --> 13:25.827
- on the Hill.
- Those families are suffering.

13:25.828 --> 13:27.428
Someone needed to have their back.

13:27.429 --> 13:30.531
You subverted policy to
serve a personal agenda.

13:30.532 --> 13:32.033
I did you a favor.

13:32.034 --> 13:33.701
We're already on edge with Russia.

13:33.702 --> 13:35.236
Sanctions will only make it worse.

13:35.237 --> 13:36.871
Teresa, if you disagree,

13:36.872 --> 13:39.140
debate us.

13:39.141 --> 13:42.844
But you cannot contradict the
president behind his back.

13:42.845 --> 13:45.379
And you have no right to
lecture me on loyalty

13:45.380 --> 13:47.248
after the stunt you pulled

13:47.249 --> 13:50.084
over the holidays.

13:50.085 --> 13:52.319
This is about my party?

13:53.486 --> 13:57.212
I have zero interest in
running for president.

13:57.213 --> 13:58.780
Really?

13:58.781 --> 14:00.615
Your actions say otherwise.

14:00.616 --> 14:02.984
I only hosted that thing

14:02.985 --> 14:05.253
to whip votes for the
land mine treaty.

14:05.254 --> 14:06.822
Well, that's not what
Jacob Barker thinks.

14:06.823 --> 14:08.990
Or half a dozen other key bundlers

14:08.991 --> 14:11.626
who will not return my calls.

14:11.627 --> 14:12.861
When I signed on as VP,

14:12.862 --> 14:14.363
when I abandoned the party

14:14.364 --> 14:16.131
I spent a lifetime working for,

14:16.132 --> 14:17.733
I was made certain promises...

14:17.734 --> 14:20.202
promises that apparently mean nothing.

14:20.203 --> 14:22.270
What promises?

14:22.271 --> 14:24.706
(SCOFFS) Oh, come on. Please.

14:24.707 --> 14:28.310
Russell Jackson pledged
Dalton's explicit support

14:28.311 --> 14:29.845
if I ever ran for president.

14:29.846 --> 14:32.446
I'm not responsible for that.

14:33.648 --> 14:36.318
But I am responsible

14:36.319 --> 14:38.854
for the foreign policy
of the United States,

14:38.855 --> 14:41.089
and you need to let me do my job.

14:41.090 --> 14:43.425
Let me tell you a story.

14:43.426 --> 14:45.794
I started out as a PTA mom

14:45.795 --> 14:49.331
who just wanted the school to
remove asbestos from the gym.

14:49.332 --> 14:52.234
I've won a lot of tough
elections since,

14:52.235 --> 14:54.403
mostly against smug, entitled men

14:54.404 --> 14:56.104
who I had to work twice as hard as.

14:56.105 --> 14:57.706
But that was all right. I expected it.

14:57.707 --> 15:00.208
But you know what I
really couldn't stand?

15:00.209 --> 15:03.478
There was always this
one influential woman

15:03.479 --> 15:06.615
who just wasn't sure about me.

15:06.616 --> 15:09.751
Of course, what she was
really struggling with

15:09.752 --> 15:12.052
was her own ambition.

15:14.423 --> 15:17.192
This little game that
you're playing, Elizabeth?

15:17.193 --> 15:20.395
I have played it a hundred times...

15:20.396 --> 15:22.397
and I've always won.

15:22.398 --> 15:25.633
So, if you'll excuse me...

15:35.677 --> 15:37.112
Okay, so, in response

15:37.113 --> 15:39.548
to the VP's novel approach
to the adoption issue,

15:39.549 --> 15:41.416
we've compiled some potential
inducements for Salnikov.

15:41.417 --> 15:42.851
The most promising idea

15:42.852 --> 15:45.554
might be in the area of public health.

15:45.555 --> 15:47.088
Russia is suffering

15:47.089 --> 15:49.758
from a severe HIV and hep C outbreak.

15:49.759 --> 15:51.226
JAY: The CDC could implement

15:51.227 --> 15:53.628
a clean needle exchange program
and smart data analysis

15:53.629 --> 15:55.263
- to help contain the outbreak.
- Good. Blake.

15:55.264 --> 15:56.565
Get Salnikov on SVTC.

15:56.566 --> 15:58.300
- See if he bites. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:58.301 --> 15:59.568
May want to hold off on that.

15:59.569 --> 16:01.837
Kremlin just released this.

16:01.838 --> 16:03.071
SALNIKOV: I was profoundly touched

16:03.072 --> 16:05.711
by the vice president's commitment

16:05.712 --> 16:06.908
to these beautiful children.

16:06.909 --> 16:09.544
It gives me hope that we
can find common ground.

16:09.545 --> 16:11.012
Accordingly,

16:11.013 --> 16:13.882
I would like to formally invite

16:13.883 --> 16:16.451
Vice President Hurst to Moscow

16:16.452 --> 16:18.253
to resolve

16:18.254 --> 16:20.021
- this adoption issue.
- Sly bastard.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.056
He's milking this.

16:21.057 --> 16:23.325
Well, you can bet Teresa will, too.

16:23.326 --> 16:24.426
Your office.

16:24.427 --> 16:25.660
Please.

16:25.661 --> 16:27.863
Russell Jackson, ma'am.

16:27.864 --> 16:31.399
It might be time to pull the plug.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.469
Is that a question or a statement?

16:34.470 --> 16:36.538
This is all her fault.

16:36.539 --> 16:38.773
Now Salnikov can look

16:38.774 --> 16:40.041
like a gallant peacemaker,

16:40.042 --> 16:42.110
all for a crisis of his own making.

16:42.111 --> 16:44.446
(SIGHS)

16:44.447 --> 16:46.880
No way his offer's sincere.

16:49.317 --> 16:50.685
That was a question.

16:50.686 --> 16:53.154
Yes, he's insincere.

16:53.155 --> 16:54.623
But it's also an opportunity.

16:54.624 --> 16:56.091
What, you think she should go?

16:56.092 --> 16:58.193
Is that really how we want

16:58.194 --> 17:00.395
to conduct diplomacy?
Throw a tantrum, get a cookie?

17:00.396 --> 17:01.630
I don't disagree.

17:01.631 --> 17:04.465
But if we have a chance to
reunite those families, yes.

17:04.467 --> 17:05.867
We have to take it.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.336
(SIGHS)

17:08.337 --> 17:09.971
Fine.

17:09.972 --> 17:12.773
But I want you babysitting
her every step of the way.

17:12.775 --> 17:14.943
If we face-plant, that's on you.

17:14.944 --> 17:16.310
Did you tell Teresa Hurst

17:16.311 --> 17:17.846
that you would support her campaign

17:17.847 --> 17:19.381
- if she ran for president?
- (SIGHS)

17:19.382 --> 17:22.416
Teresa Hurst is a fine public servant.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.019
We just happen to like you better.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.554
Just answer the question, Russell.

17:25.555 --> 17:28.089
Hurst was the only person

17:28.089 --> 17:29.858
who could deliver us Pennsylvania.

17:29.859 --> 17:31.092
I'd have sold my own mother

17:31.093 --> 17:33.995
to get those electoral votes.

17:33.996 --> 17:35.763
Does Conrad know?

17:42.003 --> 17:44.906
I make promises

17:44.907 --> 17:48.243
so that he doesn't have to.

17:48.244 --> 17:50.879
- We done here?
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:50.880 --> 17:53.214
Sorry to interrupt.
Ephraim Ware called.

17:53.215 --> 17:54.983
You're needed at
Liberty Crossing ASAP.

17:54.984 --> 17:56.320
Well, tell him I'll be right there.

17:56.321 --> 17:57.519
I meant the secretary.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.120
Did he say what it was about?

17:59.121 --> 18:00.354
Just that it's urgent.

18:05.026 --> 18:07.929
Okay, this Afghan deal. We
got to figure out a way

18:07.930 --> 18:09.998
to decrease our footprint in-country

18:09.999 --> 18:13.068
and be more creative and-and
flexible with our mission.

18:13.069 --> 18:14.603
Where's Alexander?

18:14.604 --> 18:16.338
We thought he was with you.

18:16.339 --> 18:18.139
Dr. McCord.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.775
Director Ware just called.
You're wanted at the ODNI.

18:20.776 --> 18:23.578
That's Igor Zhukov,

18:23.579 --> 18:26.648
a GRU agent and noted assassin.

18:26.649 --> 18:28.283
Facial recognition caught him

18:28.284 --> 18:31.052
at a tollbooth on I-95
near the Beltway.

18:31.053 --> 18:34.389
We have reason to believe his
target is Dmitri Petrov.

18:34.390 --> 18:36.524
Seems your instincts were right.

18:36.525 --> 18:37.959
Based on what?

18:37.960 --> 18:40.161
NSA intercepted a communiquÃ©

18:40.162 --> 18:43.064
sharing his personnel file
with unknown Russian assets

18:43.065 --> 18:44.332
in the United States.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.700
Tell me you've secured Petrov.

18:45.701 --> 18:47.369
I had CIA Security

18:47.370 --> 18:49.671
place both Mr. Petrov and his sister

18:49.672 --> 18:52.207
in protective custody an hour ago.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.176
Well, I see how this is...

18:55.177 --> 18:56.444
relevant to Henry,

18:56.445 --> 18:58.245
but why am I at this meeting?

18:59.914 --> 19:02.250
This matter pertains to
your daughter, as well.

19:02.251 --> 19:05.754
It appears that Stephanie

19:05.755 --> 19:07.088
is in a romantic relationship

19:07.089 --> 19:09.024
with Mr. Petrov.

19:09.025 --> 19:10.725
- Oh, my God.
- What?

19:10.726 --> 19:12.227
Uh, I'm sorry you're only
learning of this now.

19:12.228 --> 19:14.087
The information was highly
compartmentalized...

19:14.088 --> 19:16.087
How did they even know each
other? How did they meet?

19:16.088 --> 19:18.116
- Henry? At the house?
- They met at the house once. Months ago.

19:18.117 --> 19:19.964
- Why would he... What is he thinking?
- ELIZABETH: Wait a second.

19:19.965 --> 19:22.303
If you know about this, then
there is a very good likelihood

19:22.304 --> 19:24.272
that the Russians
know about this, too.

19:24.273 --> 19:25.473
Stevie could end up
as collateral damage.

19:25.474 --> 19:26.508
That's right. Where is she?

19:26.509 --> 19:27.442
She's still at the White House?

19:27.443 --> 19:29.044
A Secret Service team

19:29.045 --> 19:30.545
is with her as we speak.

19:30.546 --> 19:33.314
But until Zhukov is captured,

19:33.315 --> 19:35.817
she'll have to stay on total lockdown

19:35.818 --> 19:38.153
at your home, in the White House...

19:38.154 --> 19:40.855
and nowhere in between.

(DOOR OPENS)

20:04.285 --> 20:05.690
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:05.691 --> 20:07.108
Did you reveal any information

20:07.109 --> 20:08.458
that could put my daughter in danger?

20:08.459 --> 20:11.844
That is, any more danger
than you already put her in?

20:11.845 --> 20:13.546
Look, I-I wanted...

20:13.547 --> 20:15.214
Just answer the question.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.682
What did you tell her?

20:16.683 --> 20:17.850
Nothing.

20:17.851 --> 20:19.919
No names. No operational details.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.554
I insisted "Alexander Mehranov."

20:21.555 --> 20:23.255
I worked at the War College.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.591
She had other suspicions,
but I never confirmed them.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.323
I maintained situational awareness.

20:27.324 --> 20:30.929
Except you kept going
back to the same hotel.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.036
She kept the relationship a secret.

20:37.037 --> 20:38.270
Was that your idea, too?

20:38.271 --> 20:40.673
I-I didn't want trouble.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.423
Yeah, and how's that
working out for you?

20:42.424 --> 20:44.276
She doesn't know anything, Henry.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.182
have to trust your judgment.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.620
why her?

a few times, and...

20:58.658 --> 21:02.061
we just... connected.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.434
to connect with.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.536
Which you shouldn't even be doing,

21:10.537 --> 21:12.314
anyway, because you just got sober.

21:12.315 --> 21:14.113
- Remember how we got you sober?
- Well, remember

21:14.114 --> 21:15.975
what I went through to become
addicted in the first place?

21:15.976 --> 21:18.911
Yes, very well. And I think
this is revenge for that.

21:18.912 --> 21:20.880
It-it... it wasn't. Please.

21:20.881 --> 21:23.215
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

21:23.216 --> 21:26.585
My-my whole life as a kid in Russia,

21:26.586 --> 21:29.522
and then... as a soldier, then a spy,

21:29.523 --> 21:32.558
there was always so much that
you weren't allowed to think,

21:32.559 --> 21:34.693
you know, to-to feel.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.662
Not if you wanted to survive.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.896
And so... so I-I didn't.

21:39.632 --> 21:43.002
And then I met Stevie,
and I thought...

21:43.003 --> 21:47.839
can't I feel what I feel just... once?

21:51.176 --> 21:55.214
And it was selfish of me, and...

21:55.215 --> 21:58.249
I apologize.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.953
And I'm sorry for what
you went through,

22:00.954 --> 22:03.956
and any part my wife and I
might have played in that.

can't see him again?

22:19.773 --> 22:21.807
We're consenting adults.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.242
It's not about that.

22:23.243 --> 22:25.177
He's a national security risk.

22:25.178 --> 22:27.246
Well, okay, well, how?

22:27.247 --> 22:28.981
I mean, specifically.

to learn that Alexander

22:31.451 --> 22:32.425

22:32.426 --> 22:34.898
For starters, Alexander
isn't even his real name.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.321

22:48.435 --> 22:50.269
- security clearance, too!,
- Not high enough, okay?

22:50.270 --> 22:53.105
Does that give you some
indication of how serious it is?

22:53.106 --> 22:55.873
It is dangerous for
you to be near him.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.643
Is he safe?

23:17.764 --> 23:20.598

There's something else on my mind.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.627
You know, I was going to adopt once.

You know, I know you don't
like the way this went down,

24:10.450 --> 24:12.117
Yes.

it's just a stalling technique.

with the practice.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.805
ELIZABETH: The key is
not to indulge him.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.373
We need to maintain firm pressure

24:34.374 --> 24:36.375
to keep these talks on track.

24:36.376 --> 24:38.476
I appreciate the tip.

Madam Vice President.

24:42.115 --> 24:44.917
Madam Secretary.

24:44.918 --> 24:47.451
- Welcome to Moscow.
- Our pleasure.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.688
We're delighted to be here

24:49.689 --> 24:51.924

24:51.925 --> 24:53.058
What a coincidence.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.860
I'm here to do the same.

24:54.861 --> 24:58.063
Maxim, I understand that you are

24:58.064 --> 25:00.499
an avid collector of antique weaponry.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.167
Mainly guns, it's true.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.502
I've heard that you have

25:03.503 --> 25:05.971
the most exclusive
collection in Europe.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.973
Perhaps you would like to take a tour.

Madam Vice President?

25:09.509 --> 25:11.243
That would be wonderful.

25:11.244 --> 25:13.544
Lead on, Mr. President.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.282
Tell me this is part of a strategy.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.251
I-I wish I could.

No sightings on metro cameras

25:27.036 --> 25:29.371

25:29.372 --> 25:30.772
He's a trained assassin.

25:30.773 --> 25:33.342
Conventional methods were
always gonna be a long shot.

25:33.343 --> 25:35.243
I think we should
read in the local PD,

25:35.244 --> 25:37.312
- get more eyeballs on the street.
- If we go wide,

25:37.313 --> 25:39.548
- he'll go to ground.
- And what's the alternative?

25:39.549 --> 25:42.184
I don't know.

25:42.185 --> 25:44.785
We use Alexander as bait.

25:45.887 --> 25:47.622
Alex has avoided predictable behavior

25:47.623 --> 25:50.726
with one exception... he had...

25:50.727 --> 25:53.362
regular meetings at the Potomac Lodge

25:53.363 --> 25:55.030
in the Hay-Adams district.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.264

25:56.265 --> 25:58.299
Enough to establish a pattern.

25:59.034 --> 26:01.570
All right. So if we have Alexander

26:01.571 --> 26:03.438
show up like it's any other day...

26:03.439 --> 26:04.740
Zhukov will make his move.

26:04.741 --> 26:06.707
And then we can move in and take him.

26:08.643 --> 26:10.312
Are we sure about this?

26:10.313 --> 26:13.548
Well, we can't have a GRU killer
loose in the United States.

26:13.549 --> 26:16.284
Zhukov's the kind of guy who
likes to make a statement.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.553
Whatever he's planning
won't be simple, or clean.

31:41.768 --> 31:43.970
Uh, I don't have a choice.

31:43.971 --> 31:45.471
I'm kind of cursed that way.

31:45.472 --> 31:46.973
You know, you don't remember this,

31:46.974 --> 31:50.610
but when you were about three,
you fell out of a tree.

31:50.611 --> 31:52.979
And you... hit the ground.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.413
You didn't move.

31:54.414 --> 31:57.183
I was... I was pretty cool.

31:57.184 --> 31:59.619
I checked your pulse, made
sure you were breathing.

31:59.620 --> 32:02.488
When we got home and I
knew you were safe,

32:02.489 --> 32:03.956
I just lost it.

32:03.957 --> 32:06.591
The thou... (EXHALES)

32:08.527 --> 32:11.597
I'm sorry I scared you.

32:11.598 --> 32:14.233
You didn't know.

32:14.234 --> 32:16.702
Yeah, but...

32:16.703 --> 32:18.504
(SIGHS)

32:18.505 --> 32:21.274
Another damaged, unavailable guy.

32:21.275 --> 32:26.646
(SCOFFS) I mean, Jareth
was an exception, but...

32:26.647 --> 32:29.315
I don't know, it just keeps happening.

32:29.316 --> 32:32.251
It's, like, becoming a
pattern or something.

32:32.252 --> 32:34.587
Look, Alexander was no Harrison or...

32:34.588 --> 32:36.088
Armon.

32:36.089 --> 32:38.691
You... Do you mean Arthur?

32:38.692 --> 32:39.992
Arthur. Arthur.

32:39.993 --> 32:41.994
He was twice your age and so pedantic.

32:41.995 --> 32:44.897
Peda... Dad, look who's talking.

32:44.898 --> 32:49.201
Look, it's completely normal
to question yourself.

32:49.202 --> 32:53.506
I do it all the time...
these days, especially.

32:53.507 --> 32:56.575
Just the idea that I would
be involved in something

32:56.576 --> 32:59.377
that put you in danger...

33:01.547 --> 33:06.552
A-Alexander did heroic
things for this country,

33:06.553 --> 33:09.988
at im-immense personal cost.

33:12.525 --> 33:14.993
He's a courageous young man.

33:30.076 --> 33:33.045
I am very pleased with this deal.

33:33.046 --> 33:36.782
Your people send me this memo
about our joint statement.

33:36.783 --> 33:39.918
It's... wonderful.

33:40.953 --> 33:43.222
But?

33:43.223 --> 33:44.957
There is one small detail

33:44.958 --> 33:47.493
I would like to add. A pledge

33:47.494 --> 33:51.764
to discuss the presence of
American troops in Bulgaria.

33:51.765 --> 33:53.499
The country you invaded.

33:53.500 --> 33:57.036
Otherwise, the adoptees
stay in Russia.

33:57.037 --> 33:58.437
Where they belong.

33:58.438 --> 34:02.208
Why don't you send us the
language you have in mind?

34:02.209 --> 34:04.742
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

34:05.478 --> 34:07.747
We need to talk, alone.

34:07.748 --> 34:09.047
Please.

34:12.318 --> 34:13.886
- (QUIETLY): We need to walk.
- Why?

34:13.887 --> 34:16.155
It's not like he declared war.

34:16.156 --> 34:19.558
Our NATO deployment is off-limits.

34:19.559 --> 34:22.561
It is a glowing red line,
and he just crossed it.

34:22.562 --> 34:24.630
We are inches from the finish line.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.797
What is the harm in negotiating?

34:25.799 --> 34:28.400
Negotiating <i>is</i> the harm.

34:28.402 --> 34:30.703
If he walks out there

34:30.704 --> 34:33.706
and says that we have opened the door

34:33.706 --> 34:36.775
to pulling out of Europe,
our allies will panic.

34:36.777 --> 34:37.810
So reassure them.

34:37.811 --> 34:39.011
By saying what?

34:39.012 --> 34:41.246
That we're being duplicitous
but not with you?

34:41.248 --> 34:42.715
We can refuse the joint statement

34:42.716 --> 34:44.382
- and come up with new incentives.
- No.

34:44.384 --> 34:46.351
Groveling will only make things worse.

34:46.353 --> 34:49.221
I cannot abandon those children.

34:49.222 --> 34:52.257
I made a promise to the American
people, to their parents,

34:52.259 --> 34:53.925
to bring them home.

34:54.659 --> 34:59.098
Your promises are not my problem.

34:59.099 --> 35:01.267
National security is.

35:01.268 --> 35:03.803
Blake.

35:03.804 --> 35:06.405
I'm leaving, Madam Vice President.

35:06.406 --> 35:08.339
So are you.

35:13.769 --> 35:17.656
That is great news. And, again,
we're ready to assist the FBI

35:17.657 --> 35:18.790
in any way you need.

35:18.791 --> 35:20.359
Yeah. Thanks. Bye.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.794
(EXHALES) We got Zhukov.

35:22.795 --> 35:24.496
Oh, thank God. Where?

35:24.497 --> 35:27.299
Uh, at the FBI checkpoint
at Lake Champlain,

35:27.300 --> 35:28.834
- near the Canadian border.
- Oh, my God.

35:28.835 --> 35:31.470
Then-then that means
Stevie's safe, right? Yes?

35:31.471 --> 35:32.940
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, we should keep

35:32.941 --> 35:35.540
the detail on her for a couple
more days, but threat is over.

35:35.541 --> 35:36.642
- Mm.
- (SIGHS)

35:36.643 --> 35:40.479
Oh, that just about
takes the sting out

35:40.480 --> 35:42.481
- of my face-plant in Moscow.
- No,

35:42.482 --> 35:44.149
come on. That's on the VP, not you.

35:44.150 --> 35:45.984
(SIGHS) Russell was right.

35:45.985 --> 35:49.454
This was a fool's errand
from the beginning,

35:49.455 --> 35:51.289
- you know?
- Here.

35:51.290 --> 35:54.593
I shouldn't have let
guilt cloud my judgment.

35:54.594 --> 35:56.395
But the thing is, honestly,

35:56.396 --> 36:00.381
I wanted to support a
woman who felt betrayed.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.868
You know? And those kids.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.170
(BOTH SIGH)

36:05.171 --> 36:06.772
I reached out to the Gundersons.

36:06.773 --> 36:10.347
You know, the-the parents
of the boy in the video?

36:10.348 --> 36:12.282
Yeah. Who could forget?

36:12.283 --> 36:14.318
Yeah.

36:14.319 --> 36:16.120
They wouldn't take my call.

36:16.121 --> 36:18.622
We would file a claim

36:18.623 --> 36:22.259
in the European Court of Human Rights.

36:22.260 --> 36:25.596
There's a chance Russia
will respect their ruling.

36:25.597 --> 36:26.930
Mm...

36:26.931 --> 36:28.799
Okay. That chance is zero.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.734
(CHUCKLES)

36:30.735 --> 36:32.736
(GROANS)

36:32.737 --> 36:34.671
Ow. Mm.

36:34.672 --> 36:37.007
(CHUCKLES) Mm.

36:37.008 --> 36:39.543
Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait.

36:39.544 --> 36:41.378
Where is Zhukov now?

36:41.379 --> 36:43.892
Uh, he's being transported
to FBI Headquarters.

36:43.893 --> 36:44.715
No, no.

36:44.716 --> 36:46.752
They'll probably just throw
him in some deep, dark hole.

36:46.753 --> 36:49.031
They can't do that.
Not yet, not yet. We got to...

36:49.032 --> 36:50.888
we got to try one thing.

36:50.889 --> 36:53.824
SALNIKOV: We categorically
deny any involvement.

36:53.825 --> 36:56.427
Such an attack would be
against our principles.

36:56.428 --> 36:58.328
This isn't your call-in show, Maxim.

36:58.329 --> 36:59.763
Platitudes won't help you.

36:59.764 --> 37:01.331
What more is there to say?

37:01.332 --> 37:04.234
Our government denies any
knowledge of Mr. Zhukov.

37:04.235 --> 37:10.107
Well, Zhukov categorically
admitted to working for the GRU.

37:10.108 --> 37:11.241
That's right. He's in custody.

37:11.242 --> 37:14.344
And he was all too
happy to name names,

37:14.345 --> 37:17.981
including that of his
handler, Yaroslav Ryback.

37:17.982 --> 37:21.351
Who is the linchpin of
your entire spy network

37:21.352 --> 37:22.653
in the United States.

37:22.654 --> 37:26.223
Ryback has been operating
under nonofficial cover.

37:26.224 --> 37:28.592
So, no diplomatic immunity.

37:28.593 --> 37:32.096
Which means, under federal law,
he can be executed.

37:32.097 --> 37:36.100
ELIZABETH: However, might
consider clemency,

37:36.101 --> 37:38.035
maybe even a future exchange,

37:38.036 --> 37:40.370
under one condition.

37:40.371 --> 37:42.206
And that would be?

37:42.207 --> 37:45.542
Honor the original terms of
the deal we struck in Moscow.

37:45.543 --> 37:48.177
Those orphans come home.

37:49.880 --> 37:53.115
They'll be on a plane tomorrow.

37:53.884 --> 37:56.053
Thank you for your time.

37:56.054 --> 37:58.489
I have to ask.

37:58.490 --> 38:01.492
This man you accuse of being GRU,

38:01.493 --> 38:04.361
he could resist any
form of interrogation.

38:04.362 --> 38:06.697
How did you get him to crack?

38:06.698 --> 38:08.665
Don't you know?

38:18.710 --> 38:20.811
Credit lies with Conrad.

38:20.812 --> 38:22.880
He had to approve it.

38:22.881 --> 38:25.849
Still, this was a guy who might
have murdered your own daughter.

38:25.850 --> 38:28.485
Trying to forget that.

38:28.486 --> 38:30.220
I'm sorry I doubted you.

38:30.221 --> 38:32.756
We make strong allies, Elizabeth.

38:32.757 --> 38:33.757
Can we bury the hatchet?

38:33.758 --> 38:34.758
Of course.

Rule yourself out.

38:47.572 --> 38:48.872
Pardon?

38:48.873 --> 38:51.375
Announce you won't run
for president in public.

38:51.376 --> 38:53.210
Shouldn't be difficult.
You've already said

38:53.211 --> 38:55.378
you have zero interest in the job.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.981
I can't do that.
