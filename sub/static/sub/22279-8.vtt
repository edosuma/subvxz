WEBVTT

00:07.167 --> 00:09.133
NARRATOR: Across the Arctic,

00:09.167 --> 00:12.200
the dog days of summer
draw to a close,

00:12.233 --> 00:16.500
and Alaska braces
for Mother Nature's icy grip.

00:16.533 --> 00:19.067
On this episode of
Life Below Zero...

00:19.100 --> 00:22.233
One, two, three.

00:22.267 --> 00:23.600
NARRATOR: Sue Aikens' grandson

00:23.633 --> 00:25.800
struggles with a lesson
in bush survival.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.867
Don't splash.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.167
NARRATOR: A sudden danger
could doom the Hailstone's
journey home.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.233
-Watch out.
-(SCREAMS)

00:32.267 --> 00:33.633
NARRATOR: Glenn scours
the tundra

00:33.667 --> 00:36.933
for an essential element
of winter survival.

00:36.967 --> 00:38.433
And in Eagle,

00:38.467 --> 00:41.200
sparks fly as cold weather
preparations get underway.

00:41.233 --> 00:43.633
One spark, this whole place
will go up real fast.

01:16.633 --> 01:21.767
You can see the bugs are
kind of thick and heavy and...

01:21.800 --> 01:23.467
Sometimes they're there,
and sometimes they're not,

01:23.500 --> 01:25.867
but we're gonna
go ahead and try to
put the sneak on it.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.733
My name is Nathan.
I'm Sue's grandson.

01:28.767 --> 01:32.800
She is trying to teach me
how to get a caribou.

01:32.833 --> 01:34.667
Keep your eyes open.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.833
NARRATOR: Nathan is visiting
from the lower 48

01:36.867 --> 01:38.967
with little experience
in the bush.

01:39.067 --> 01:43.367
Sue hopes to teach him
how to better survive
Kavik's harsh conditions.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.200
NATHAN: My grandma's life
is very, very cool.

01:46.233 --> 01:48.233
Hunting, most grandmas
don't do that.

01:48.267 --> 01:50.167
I do worry about her a lot.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.500
Um, it is good for me to
come up here and check on her.

01:53.533 --> 01:57.233
A couple of years ago,
she got attacked by a bear.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.233
NARRATOR: With winter
on the horizon,

01:59.267 --> 02:02.233
Sue has a limited opportunity
to hunt caribou

02:02.267 --> 02:06.267
before the tundra freezes
and the animals become scarce.

02:06.300 --> 02:10.333
SUE: This ground
is extremely uneven, isn't it?

02:10.367 --> 02:12.967
So take your time,
lead with your toe,

02:13.067 --> 02:17.067
let your toes and everything
tell you where
the obstructions are.

02:17.067 --> 02:20.433
Breaking your ankle out here,
nobody's gonna be
helping you, are they?

02:22.233 --> 02:23.733
There's gonna come a day.

02:23.767 --> 02:26.700
I don't know what
my expiration date is,
but it's coming.

02:26.733 --> 02:28.533
And I'd like to know that

02:28.567 --> 02:30.967
if he needs to,
he has a skill called hunting,

02:31.067 --> 02:32.533
and he can get his own food.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.433
What I try to instil
in my grandchildren is

02:35.467 --> 02:38.300
believe in yourself,
be proud of yourself,

02:38.333 --> 02:40.400
be a good person all the time.

02:40.433 --> 02:42.867
Grab life by the balls
and live it.

02:42.900 --> 02:44.633
I'm thinking
if we don't spook them

02:44.667 --> 02:48.067
or see them by the time we hit
that next copse over there,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.933
then we'll turn around
and head back.

02:50.967 --> 02:54.333
Bugs like this, this late
in the year, it's just not
even heard of.

02:54.367 --> 02:57.833
So they are keeping
my food source away.

02:57.867 --> 02:59.733
We haven't
run across some caribou.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.633
So I'm thinking they're,

03:01.667 --> 03:04.100
they're probably fairly
stunned at the bug situation.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.200
They don't eat them, but they
do get bugged by them.

03:06.233 --> 03:07.600
And when you're hunting

03:07.633 --> 03:09.900
for a means of supporting
yourself, foodwise,

03:09.933 --> 03:11.367
it is not a guarantee.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.300
Nature has a way of
just doing what it wants, huh?

03:14.767 --> 03:16.400
Yeah.

03:16.433 --> 03:18.300
It is part of life up here,
and if he's really
interested in it,

03:18.333 --> 03:21.767
you know, like he says he
wouldn't mind running this
place when I keel.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.400
Well, this is part of
the territory,
better get used to it.

03:24.433 --> 03:26.633
Think you could work
in an office like this?

03:26.667 --> 03:28.367
-Yeah.
-You think so?

03:29.267 --> 03:31.167
Bears are gonna
try to eat you.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.133
Cold is gonna try to kill you.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.133
Bugs are gonna
try to carry you off.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.333
Think you can handle that?

03:42.100 --> 03:44.067
GLENN: If you wanna
live in the wilderness,

03:44.067 --> 03:46.067
close to nature,
in an area that hasn't been

03:46.067 --> 03:49.067
changed drastically
by human activities,

03:49.100 --> 03:51.367
this is one of
the very few places left.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.567
By the end of October,

04:03.600 --> 04:05.333
the sun sets
for the last time.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.800
I won't see it again
for over 100 days.

04:07.833 --> 04:11.600
Got about a month
to get certain jobs done
that I want to do outside.

04:11.633 --> 04:15.167
It's important to be
all set up ahead of time.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.933
I have to cut a considerable
amount of wood out here
to get through the year.

04:17.967 --> 04:20.433
During the wintertime,
during the coldest
months of the year,

04:20.467 --> 04:23.233
I'll go through four cubic
feet of wood in one day.

04:23.267 --> 04:24.667
That's about a cord a month.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.200
Food, water,
clothing, shelter.

04:30.233 --> 04:33.067
And to keep that shelter warm,
I've got to have wood.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.900
You can see the forest here,
it's all green trees
that are living.

04:39.933 --> 04:42.300
I don't like to cut
those for wood,
I like to cut dead wood

04:42.333 --> 04:44.600
because it's lighter,
and it burns better.

04:44.633 --> 04:47.267
I've cut all the dead wood
in this area close to my camp.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.133
Over the years, I've had to go
further and further

04:49.167 --> 04:50.867
away from my camp
in order to get firewood.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.300
So today I'll probably go
a few hundred yards from camp.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.867
It's a long ways
to get wood back,

04:54.900 --> 04:58.133
but that's the nearest
that I can get enough
dead wood now.

05:01.067 --> 05:04.667
I don't use a calendar
out here, but I pay
attention to the seasons.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.300
When the leaves
start changing colour,

05:06.333 --> 05:08.133
it's time to
get ready for winter.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.467
Pretty soon that lake's
going to freeze over,

05:09.500 --> 05:11.400
and I need
some firewood out here.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.200
So this looks great.

05:14.233 --> 05:16.067
Lots of dead trees,

05:16.700 --> 05:18.133
close together.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.067
I just like the feeling
of being in shape

05:24.067 --> 05:25.667
and using my body physically.

05:25.700 --> 05:29.067
Out here, I don't have to
worry about going to a gym.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.533
All the jobs I do,

05:30.567 --> 05:33.700
I choose to do them in ways
that I get a lot of exercise.

05:33.733 --> 05:37.467
Even though the job itself
might get a bit mundane,

05:37.500 --> 05:39.767
it's the environment
I'm doing it in

05:39.800 --> 05:41.433
that keeps it interesting.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.300
I didn't come here
because it was paradise

05:48.333 --> 05:49.833
or the Garden of Eden.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.133
I chose this spot to live

05:51.167 --> 05:52.967
because it was the last
place in the world

05:53.067 --> 05:54.800
where I thought
I could live this way.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.700
The winter that's coming,

06:01.733 --> 06:03.833
I'm gonna burn this amount
of wood in just
a couple of weeks' time.

06:03.867 --> 06:06.933
So I have to start building
piles up now around the woods,

06:06.967 --> 06:08.767
make sure I stay
a little bit ahead

06:08.800 --> 06:11.467
and have plenty of wood to get
me through the cold weather.

06:13.433 --> 06:16.400
This is a good start,
but I got
a lot more work to do.

06:17.967 --> 06:20.167
ANDY: You're always gonna
have a few setbacks.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.667
That's just
a part of living out here.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.900
Everybody gets their butt
kicked every now and then.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.100
Hopefully, you don't lose
your life doing it.

06:33.933 --> 06:35.700
Feels like fall to me.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.433
Feels like the middle
of fall to me.

06:38.467 --> 06:40.667
Holy cow.
I can't believe the hills.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.567
Right now, we're getting into
the waning part of the summer.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.767
The fall colours
are already happening

06:45.800 --> 06:48.300
in the high country
across the river from us,

06:48.333 --> 06:50.633
and that's our barometer
telling us

06:50.667 --> 06:54.200
that fall and winter are very
soon to be here.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.600
Today's project is to start
emptying out the trash

07:03.633 --> 07:06.200
we've been accumulating
since the flood around here

07:06.233 --> 07:08.300
for four or five years now.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.633
My hopes are
to get rid of this trash

07:10.667 --> 07:12.533
by bringing it over
to the landfill,

07:12.567 --> 07:16.067
burning what will burn,
pushing the rest into the pit.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.200
The pit is full of water,

07:17.233 --> 07:19.733
so any metal's gonna
rust away pretty quick.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.400
We're getting
into late summer.

07:23.433 --> 07:24.500
We've had a little bit
of rain,

07:24.533 --> 07:26.067
so things
are a little bit damp.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.633
And that's why I'm choosing
this day to do this,

07:28.667 --> 07:31.367
but there's always a potential
for starting a forest fire,

07:31.400 --> 07:34.067
and once started
there's no putting it out.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.633
I think what
I'm gonna to do here

07:37.667 --> 07:39.100
is fire this pump up,

07:39.133 --> 07:41.967
and then
try and spray some water
around here to wet,

07:42.067 --> 07:43.667
wet the area down
a little bit.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.167
The type of stuff I'm burning
is a lot of paper,

07:46.200 --> 07:49.300
and stuff that's gonna
throw out a lot of embers.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.300
It only takes one spark
in this black spruce forest

07:52.333 --> 07:55.133
and this whole place
will go up real fast.

07:55.167 --> 07:57.067
(WHIRRING)

08:18.533 --> 08:20.567
I think it's time to go get
the bulldozer,

08:20.600 --> 08:22.067
and start hauling trash.

08:23.967 --> 08:26.467
CHIP: I wanna be able
to give my kids
a more rounder education.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.233
I want them to have
a countrywise education.

08:28.267 --> 08:30.267
They're gonna
remember this stuff
the rest of their lives.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.700
And it'll be important
lessons, and it's also an
important feeling for them

08:32.733 --> 08:35.267
to know that they're
successful, that they can do

08:35.300 --> 08:38.233
exactly what it takes
to provide for themselves.

08:51.067 --> 08:54.300
AGNES: I'll go find our new
place for our cache.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.900
CHIP: A cache is a place
where you store your things.

08:55.933 --> 08:59.067
We frequent this spot
from February
till about the end of August.

09:00.667 --> 09:03.067
And then the rest of our year
is spent up Noorvik.

09:04.933 --> 09:06.333
This is a higher ridge
right here.

09:06.367 --> 09:09.333
I'm thinking more,
more towards past
the old house pit here.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.333
I'm gonna leave my
equipment behind, fishing net,

09:13.367 --> 09:14.433
maybe a tent,

09:14.467 --> 09:16.567
cook stove, stuff like that,
easily removable.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.533
And put it right here
where there have been
other caches

09:18.567 --> 09:21.133
and people for a couple
thousand years probably.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.733
Just to think a whole family
probably lived there

09:22.767 --> 09:24.467
-at one time, huh?
-Yeah.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.633
-Now it's just
a hole in the ground.
-Yeah. Now it's our turn.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.233
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

09:28.267 --> 09:30.633
We could take all this
stuff home, but it would be
very expensive

09:30.667 --> 09:32.900
and it would take many loads.

09:32.933 --> 09:35.633
Just taking it across
the ocean would be
very costly,

09:35.667 --> 09:38.067
and it would be very,
very, very time consuming.

09:38.067 --> 09:40.767
I don't want to build a cache
too much higher
than you or myself

09:40.800 --> 09:42.300
so I'll make it
just high enough

09:42.333 --> 09:44.933
for myself to go into,
and then build you a ladder,

09:44.967 --> 09:46.633
-and we'll put our
things right here.
-Yeah, I want it

09:46.667 --> 09:49.867
in the willows, too,
so that we could be kind of...

09:49.900 --> 09:50.933
-Private?
-Private, yeah.

09:50.967 --> 09:52.400
-Right on.
-Yeah. Yep.

09:52.433 --> 09:53.733
Yep, this will be
the place then.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.067
I need to have it
weatherproof.
I need to have it animalproof,

09:58.067 --> 09:59.167
and I need to have it
riverproof

09:59.200 --> 10:01.633
because in the spring,
the river floods.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.200
Water will be flowing
right over this.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.033
All right, I'll get to it.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.700
When you're gonna
build something,

10:12.733 --> 10:14.867
you might as well use
the best materials possible.

10:14.900 --> 10:17.600
Since those best materials
are available just
upriver from where I camp,

10:17.633 --> 10:19.300
I decided that
instead of using driftwood,

10:19.333 --> 10:22.333
that I would make a right,
proper, long-lasting cache.

10:27.367 --> 10:29.567
My plan is to
get some longer poles,

10:29.600 --> 10:31.033
the ones that will go
in the ground.

10:32.767 --> 10:35.300
What I need are
fresher trees because they
can bear the weight.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.200
They have the strength
that I'm looking for,

10:37.233 --> 10:39.200
and they'll last a long time.

10:39.233 --> 10:40.233
Yep.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.300
Oh, yeah.

10:46.333 --> 10:48.333
Part of having camps
and living the way we do

10:48.367 --> 10:51.467
is to be able to leave certain
specific equipment behind.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.267
So if I have certain things
that I use only
in a certain area,

10:54.300 --> 10:55.967
I would rather put them
into a cache,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.167
you know, instead of hauling
the equipment
back and forth with us.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.500
We trust in our neighbours,

11:00.533 --> 11:01.900
and we trust in the people
in the Kiwalik

11:01.933 --> 11:04.467
and the neighbouring villages
not to mess with our stuff.

11:06.267 --> 11:08.067
This could be
pretty tough work.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.067
Work up a heck of a sweat,

11:11.067 --> 11:12.400
hopefully,
not injure yourself,

11:12.433 --> 11:14.500
but nobody's
gonna do it for me.

11:14.533 --> 11:16.067
(WHIRRING)

11:29.500 --> 11:30.633
Whoa!

11:31.400 --> 11:32.933
Two things went on there.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.067
My foot found a hole,

11:34.067 --> 11:35.833
and I just skipped
a chain off.

11:35.867 --> 11:38.267
Man, I could have fallen over
backwards on that one.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.633
And I use a chainsaw
quite a bit by myself,

11:41.667 --> 11:43.333
and that's a power tool.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.533
And any power tool,
you have to respect them.

11:45.567 --> 11:48.333
The reason why we use them
is 'cause they're
more powerful than us.

11:48.367 --> 11:49.767
Freaked me out.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.300
Get her in the groove,
in the groove.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.267
The last thing
I want to do is cut myself.

11:55.267 --> 11:57.467
Getting myself back downriver

11:57.500 --> 12:00.067
and then finding a flight that
would take me to Anchorage

12:00.067 --> 12:01.433
to a proper doctor

12:01.467 --> 12:03.367
could be
hours or days in the making.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.433
And, um, a lot of people
don't really survive that.

12:08.567 --> 12:10.067
Okay, here we go.

12:11.767 --> 12:14.567
You know,
you really can't drive a car
for an entire lifetime,

12:14.600 --> 12:16.800
you can't shoot a gun
for an entire lifetime.

12:16.833 --> 12:19.667
There's a time that comes
where things are wore out
and need to be replaced.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.767
(WHIRRS)

12:31.533 --> 12:34.233
I got the four logs
that I came up here to get.

12:34.267 --> 12:35.667
They're pretty long,
pretty straight,

12:35.700 --> 12:37.400
and I'm going to make eight
pieces of wood out of them.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.400
So I'm pretty happy
with what I got.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.733
(STRAINS)
This is about the most
I can manage myself.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.367
(GRUNTS)

12:47.400 --> 12:49.233
If I cut them up right now,

12:49.267 --> 12:51.900
the fact is you can make
a long piece of wood
short as much as you want.

12:51.933 --> 12:53.300
You can't make no short
piece of wood long.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.433
So my best bet is to
keep them intact like this...

12:56.600 --> 12:59.133
Put them in the boat,
balance carefully,

12:59.167 --> 13:00.967
and go back home now.

13:01.067 --> 13:03.067
Oh, green trees are so heavy.

13:05.267 --> 13:06.633
These are still
full of moisture.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.833
They have a lot of integrity,
they're fresh,

13:08.867 --> 13:10.667
and they'll last many,
many years.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.933
GLENN: I really enjoy
living out here

13:18.967 --> 13:20.467
because the whole environment,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.767
it just suits the way
my brain works.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.300
I find it intellectually
stimulating to be out here,

13:25.333 --> 13:27.067
physically stimulating.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.733
And it's just a very
sensual experience, too.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.433
NARRATOR:
With winter approaching,

13:42.467 --> 13:44.467
Glenn Villeneuve
works around the clock

13:44.500 --> 13:47.333
gathering wood
to help him survive.

13:47.367 --> 13:50.533
The firewood process is
that I take a standing tree,

13:50.567 --> 13:53.367
fell it in the woods,
and cut it into
a six-foot-long piece

13:53.400 --> 13:55.567
that will
fit in my sled to get it home.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.133
Once I get it home,

13:57.167 --> 14:00.600
I stack the six-foot-long
sled length
pieces here in the yard.

14:00.633 --> 14:02.367
Then I use this sawbuck

14:02.400 --> 14:04.333
with the larger
diameter pieces

14:04.367 --> 14:06.067
to saw them with a bowsaw

14:06.100 --> 14:08.200
into lengths
that will fit in my stove.

14:08.233 --> 14:10.067
If it's large diameter,

14:10.067 --> 14:12.267
I also have to split it
after I saw it.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.733
Winter can be

14:18.767 --> 14:21.467
pretty challenging
if you're not ready for it.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.500
And you get caught behind.

14:25.533 --> 14:28.500
If you don't have firewood,
for example, and all of a
sudden winter sets in.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.567
It can be quite a challenge
just to keep up.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.667
It can be hand-to-mouth.

14:31.700 --> 14:32.700
I've done that before

14:32.733 --> 14:34.700
when I don't have
any wood in reserve.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
There, just made it.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.633
Uh, this is
an interesting thing.

14:40.667 --> 14:41.867
Gosh, I can't count them

14:41.900 --> 14:43.733
with just my fingernail
for a reference,

14:43.767 --> 14:45.833
but this tree is very old.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.833
There's the middle
right there.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.933
One, two, three.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.733
So that's about
10 years right there.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.233
Ten, 20, 30, 60, 70, 80.

14:56.267 --> 14:58.300
That tree is well over
100 years old.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.367
Larger pieces
have to then be split,

15:07.400 --> 15:09.500
then I can
fit them in my stove.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.533
It doesn't want to go.

15:13.567 --> 15:16.700
It's gonna take
several whacks at least.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.900
A wedge is a powerful tool.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.967
You can do a lot with a wedge.

15:23.067 --> 15:26.100
For the most difficult pieces,

15:26.133 --> 15:27.800
I have to use this system.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.500
Yeah.

15:47.467 --> 15:48.767
I'm gonna do it.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.133
Inside, I've got
a little wood crib.

15:53.167 --> 15:55.233
This is four cubic feet.

15:55.267 --> 15:57.133
On a really
cold day in the winter,

15:57.167 --> 15:59.100
this full wood crib
will get burned up

15:59.133 --> 16:01.167
in one 24-hour period.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.133
And wood
is what I use for cooking.

16:03.167 --> 16:05.367
It's what I use
for heating hot water.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.567
It's nice to have a little bit
of reserve wood pile

16:09.067 --> 16:10.500
built up.

16:10.533 --> 16:12.167
When I start
moose hunting in the fall,

16:12.200 --> 16:14.500
I wanna just focus
on hunting every day.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.333
I don't want to be
worried about

16:16.367 --> 16:19.400
cutting firewood
for a couple of weeks, so...

16:19.433 --> 16:23.200
I've got some firewood now
to see me through that period.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.633
I feel prepared
and I feel excited.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.633
Just a few more weeks.

16:27.667 --> 16:29.500
It'll be time
to start hunting.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.067
ANDY: There's always
a challenge out here.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.367
There's always adaptation.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.433
Nothing is the same
every year.

16:37.467 --> 16:40.100
You're constantly rethinking
how you're gonna do something,

16:40.133 --> 16:43.633
adapting to it, and hopefully
winning, not losing.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.400
We'll see if I can
take this over there

16:54.433 --> 16:57.233
and use my big bucket on this
to get rid of this trash

16:57.267 --> 16:59.600
by bringing it over
to the landfill.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.500
Well, we've got some
electrical lines

17:01.533 --> 17:03.533
that I need
to go underneath of.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.500
If I was to catch that
with the bulldozer

17:06.533 --> 17:07.700
on the way underneath,

17:07.733 --> 17:09.667
it would rip out the power
lines from our house.

17:09.700 --> 17:12.900
Right now we're running
a 6,000-watt generator

17:12.933 --> 17:15.433
to run the dehydrators
and the freezers.

17:15.467 --> 17:19.067
So it's pretty dangerous
handling overhead power lines.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.533
I better go get Kate,

17:20.567 --> 17:23.600
make sure she can keep
an eye on this wire for me.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.967
The last thing I wanna do
is snag that with my boom

17:26.067 --> 17:28.467
on the tractor 'cause that's
gonna electrify my tractor,

17:28.500 --> 17:32.200
and I think I'm gonna get
a new hairdo pretty quick.

17:32.233 --> 17:34.133
So we've got to
come up with a method here

17:34.167 --> 17:36.100
to get those wires
up and out of the way

17:36.133 --> 17:37.800
until I can get past them.

17:37.833 --> 17:39.467
So I need you to

17:39.500 --> 17:41.333
-keep an eye
on this wire here...
-Yeah.

17:41.367 --> 17:45.233
When I go under it with
the boom, make sure I don't
snag that wire, okay?

17:45.267 --> 17:46.867
Just holler really loud.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.867
KATE: I'll stand
right here by it.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.367
Yeah, you need two hands on it

17:50.400 --> 17:52.433
'cause you may have to
push it up. I don't know.

17:52.467 --> 17:55.500
Okay. Watch for my fists,
that means stop.

18:12.433 --> 18:13.733
Whoa!

18:14.967 --> 18:16.333
(ANDY SPEAKS)

18:21.533 --> 18:22.533
(ANDY SPEAKS)

18:32.700 --> 18:33.767
KATE: What Andy's doing now

18:33.800 --> 18:35.367
is a task
that needed to be done.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.600
A lot of this is stuff
that was left from 2009.

18:38.633 --> 18:41.467
We've got a lot of debris
and things that are ruined,

18:41.500 --> 18:42.833
and uh,

18:42.867 --> 18:45.133
there's just no way
of getting it out of here.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.700
So what we're
gonna do is burn it.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.733
It's been a really,
really wet summer,

18:48.767 --> 18:52.067
and it's a good time
to try, and uh...

18:52.900 --> 18:54.100
But you know,

18:54.133 --> 18:56.733
a forest fire would mean
the end of Calico.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.467
ANDY: I am concerned
about forest fires.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.233
That would be
absolutely devastating to us.

19:13.267 --> 19:15.533
If we burn
this country around here,

19:15.567 --> 19:17.633
we got no protection
from the elements.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.200
All right, let's get
a fire going here.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.333
GLENN: Basically, I got
a philosophy in life.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.133
If I don't need something,

19:27.167 --> 19:28.467
I go without it.

19:41.367 --> 19:44.867
What I wanna do today is
I wanna build a ladder
and put it right here

19:44.900 --> 19:46.567
just to help me
get up to my chimney.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.967
I clean my chimney
as often as once a week.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.200
The reason I have to
go up there

19:50.233 --> 19:51.867
and clean the chimney so much

19:51.900 --> 19:55.600
is creosote, a build-up
inside the stove pipe.

19:55.633 --> 19:57.833
It's a highly
flammable material.

19:57.867 --> 20:01.100
If that catches on fire,
the stove pipe can get so hot,

20:01.133 --> 20:03.533
that it can catch
the whole place on fire.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.800
But it would be nice
to just have a ladder
here all the time.

20:05.833 --> 20:08.767
Then I could just come out
and easily go up
whenever I wanted to,

20:08.800 --> 20:10.367
make the job a lot simpler.

20:14.733 --> 20:18.067
This is some leftover wood
from another project.

20:18.100 --> 20:21.700
Hopefully, I can get enough
here to get started
with the ladder project,

20:21.733 --> 20:23.200
if not finish it.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.533
So I'm just going to
set it upside down.

20:30.567 --> 20:33.300
I don't want it too narrow,
but I don't want it too wide.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.467
So, time to make some rungs.

20:38.900 --> 20:42.467
In this environment,
the reality is
you have to think ahead.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.700
You have to plan

20:43.733 --> 20:46.500
because the resources
just aren't here year round.

20:46.533 --> 20:49.900
You have such extreme
differences in seasons.

20:49.933 --> 20:51.667
You do have to
take into account

20:52.467 --> 20:53.933
what's around the corner.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.333
So when something's available,

20:55.367 --> 20:57.233
I have to take
advantage of it.

20:59.567 --> 21:01.067
You might wanna
live in the moment,

21:01.067 --> 21:02.333
but you do have to plan
for the future,

21:02.367 --> 21:03.733
there's no doubt about that.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.467
Let's see how this goes.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.367
Ah. It's a beauty.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.400
Look at that. I'm gonna
go up and check my chimney.

21:19.167 --> 21:21.067
A little creosote in there.

21:31.633 --> 21:33.167
There.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.800
That looks nice and clean.

21:36.967 --> 21:38.767
SUE: You have to be

21:38.800 --> 21:41.400
dead nuts about who you are,
what you want out of life,

21:41.433 --> 21:43.333
and how the hell
you're gonna get it.

21:43.367 --> 21:46.233
You better have both hands
on the pistol and ready
to aim and shoot.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.333
Got an assload
of caribou right there.

22:03.367 --> 22:04.967
We gotta get going
to go get them.

22:05.067 --> 22:07.067
So I'm gonna
head down the road.

22:10.433 --> 22:12.500
NARRATOR: After a failed
caribou hunt,

22:12.533 --> 22:15.233
Sue and Nathan head out
for another attempt,

22:15.267 --> 22:16.833
before the herd migrates.

22:16.867 --> 22:19.867
SUE: I've noticed a little
bit of a change this year.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.800
Uh, the caribou just changed
their migration route

22:22.833 --> 22:24.367
and I'm gonna make the most

22:24.400 --> 22:26.533
of the opportunity
while I can.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.700
Let's go start hiking.

22:29.733 --> 22:31.067
All right.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.400
I wanna get closer,

22:36.433 --> 22:37.667
but they're gonna make us.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.733
Coming on the road,
they kind of made us.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.300
We're gonna have water
to go through.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.067
Try to stay low.

22:55.367 --> 22:56.267
(SPLASHES)

22:56.300 --> 22:58.200
Nathan, don't splash.

22:59.133 --> 23:00.367
Don't fall.

23:02.133 --> 23:04.633
They've seen us.
They've made us.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.100
Give me the sticks.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.933
Shit.

23:13.967 --> 23:16.600
Next time I want you
to hand me to them,

23:16.633 --> 23:18.233
I want you to open them.

23:18.267 --> 23:21.600
He recognises that hunting
is gonna get the meat
that I need.

23:21.633 --> 23:25.133
He recognises that
I can love animals,

23:25.167 --> 23:27.233
turn it off, and shoot one.

23:27.267 --> 23:29.133
Can he do the same thing?

23:38.867 --> 23:40.300
(GUNSHOT FIRES)

23:42.667 --> 23:44.067

23:45.967 --> 23:47.533
Safety's on.

23:51.367 --> 23:53.800
Well, let's go see
what we've done.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.833
He's a young man that seems to
be making really good choices.

23:56.867 --> 24:01.633
He's looking at life with
a career frame of mind.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.533
But in the end,

24:03.567 --> 24:05.933
he's a grandson just
wanting to be with his grandma

24:05.967 --> 24:07.267
and get a little time in.

24:08.133 --> 24:09.667
You got kind of wet.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.567
Boneheaded that one section
of stream, didn't you?

24:12.600 --> 24:13.767
What do you step on?

24:14.733 --> 24:16.500
You step on the weeds, huh?

24:16.533 --> 24:19.300
I think you kind of missed it,
and decided to go for a swim.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.267
Need a shower that bad, huh?

24:22.333 --> 24:23.767
You're travelling
with a firearm.

24:24.967 --> 24:26.267
Safety's on.

24:33.133 --> 24:35.500
SUE: Yeah, I'm not
swimming that.

24:35.533 --> 24:37.967
I don't get to see
my family very often.

24:38.067 --> 24:39.567
That's something I've chosen.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.600
That's one of
the repercussions

24:41.633 --> 24:44.300
of having a lifestyle
that pleases me.

24:44.333 --> 24:47.533
But when I do, it's cherished
and valued time.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.533
What do you think?

24:50.567 --> 24:51.767
Meat in the freezer?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.167
(NATHAN SPEAKS)

24:56.900 --> 24:58.067
(PANTS)

24:58.700 --> 24:59.800
Phew.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.367
Well, come here.

25:05.267 --> 25:08.500
So, this is a bull.

25:08.533 --> 25:12.133
In the caribou family,
females and males get racks.

25:12.167 --> 25:15.167
Males are generally bigger,
not always.

25:15.767 --> 25:17.600
First thing we do,

25:17.633 --> 25:19.133
you always say thanks.

25:19.167 --> 25:22.600
This guy gave up his life
so we could have food,
didn't he?

25:22.633 --> 25:25.700
So what do you do? Get over
here and tell him thanks.

25:27.367 --> 25:29.700
Yeah, you respect
the life you take, man.

25:29.733 --> 25:31.167
Being here,

25:31.200 --> 25:33.200
I think
it's a healthy experience.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.133
He's developing
a sense of self

25:35.167 --> 25:37.267
and responsibility
for his own actions.

25:38.400 --> 25:40.500
Thank you for
helping me, buddy.

25:40.533 --> 25:42.900
SUE: We've gotta
get back to the four-wheeler,

25:42.933 --> 25:45.067
get the knife bag,
get the trailer,

25:45.067 --> 25:46.367
and bring him in.

25:50.700 --> 25:53.600
CHIP: A lot of people
just don't get
the idea of being out here.

25:53.633 --> 25:56.467
They just don't realise
that we get to
shape ourselves here,

25:56.500 --> 25:58.100
and we get to
flow with nature.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.567
NARRATOR: With winter looming,

26:12.600 --> 26:15.300
Chip must build
a cache to store his supplies

26:15.333 --> 26:17.633
before their venture
back home to Noorvik.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.100
This should work.

26:22.333 --> 26:25.300
Cut through the sod first
with the shovel.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.933
We know this area very well,

26:27.967 --> 26:30.533
and we come back all the time,
so I really need to
have the cache here,

26:30.567 --> 26:32.533
so that I'm not hauling
this stuff back and forth.

26:32.567 --> 26:33.800
It'll be here in place.

26:33.833 --> 26:36.433
It's a good waterproof
place to put my equipment.

26:36.467 --> 26:37.367
Okay.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.233
And it's kind of
a landmark too, because

26:39.267 --> 26:41.067
in the middle of winter
when this is all white,

26:41.067 --> 26:42.333
that cache will stick out.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.200
I guess the next one
will be about here.

26:44.233 --> 26:45.833
I've selected an area
where it's nice and high

26:45.867 --> 26:48.067
where it's fairly
brush-free at the moment.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.667
And then I'm gonna
dig down the holes,

26:50.700 --> 26:53.067
and when I have
the measurement of how
deep my hole is,

26:53.067 --> 26:54.767
then I can measure
my cache off of that.

26:59.467 --> 27:02.100
I'm pretty happy with that.
Now I've hit permafrost.

27:03.367 --> 27:06.067
Permafrost is permanently
frozen ground

27:06.067 --> 27:07.667
that northern Alaska
is full of.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.233
The permafrost here
is probably about

27:10.267 --> 27:12.567
two, maybe three feet down,
the deeper the better.

27:18.567 --> 27:21.167
We'll call that good.
I got four holes.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.367
I need to put in
my eight posts,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.667
my four good
strong rigid ones,

27:26.700 --> 27:28.467
my two shorter ones,

27:28.500 --> 27:30.467
put my crossbeams,
make my floor,

27:30.500 --> 27:33.233
make my walls, make my roof,
make a ladder,

27:33.900 --> 27:35.400
and be done with it.

27:35.433 --> 27:37.600
I want to
make it about high enough
to walk under.

27:37.633 --> 27:40.267
And it keeps it above
the water, and it keeps it
above most animals...

27:42.100 --> 27:44.300
Takes me and my wife
to carry the posts.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.433
Pack them really good
so they don't go anywhere,

27:46.467 --> 27:48.667
and then just start
building on the platform.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.067
There, see what we can get.

27:50.067 --> 27:51.200
Is it all the way in?

27:51.233 --> 27:53.067
-It's about to.
-Whoa.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.067
This one is kind of heavier.

27:55.067 --> 27:58.100
Those logs are kind of
heavy but light enough for
Chip and I to carry them.

27:58.133 --> 28:00.933
But if something were to fall
on us, I'm sure it would

28:00.967 --> 28:03.867
put a pretty good scratch.

28:03.900 --> 28:06.333
CHIP: Part of the renewal
process is making storage.

28:06.367 --> 28:07.767
If you don't
store your things properly

28:07.800 --> 28:09.433
through the winter away from
the animals and the weather,

28:09.467 --> 28:10.800
you ain't going to
have it very long.

28:10.833 --> 28:14.200
Ooh, my God,
I can't even lift this
over my shoulder.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.100
This one's heavy.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.167
Add some mud in there,
oh, that one go deep.

28:25.667 --> 28:26.667
Right on.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.467
Okay, I can do
the rest of this myself.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.067
AGNES: Oh, that's gonna be
a good one.

28:33.100 --> 28:36.133
Yep. I'll get to doing this.

28:36.167 --> 28:37.333
Do you have
berry picking to do?

28:37.367 --> 28:39.767
-Yep.
-Get your berry picking.

28:39.800 --> 28:43.867
(SCREAMS) Oh, scary.
Oh, my God!

28:43.900 --> 28:45.900
Fucked up.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.867
CHIP: Never trust a tree.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.133
That was fucking scary.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.067
One of the posts just leaned
so it freaked me out.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.767
But always got to remember
your surroundings
and keep your eyes open.

29:02.367 --> 29:05.333
CHIP: I have my four tall
posts in the ground,

29:05.367 --> 29:08.600
and I'm making my
short posts that fit
right up next to them.

29:10.067 --> 29:11.433
This place
floods out every year.

29:11.467 --> 29:13.200
That's why I wouldn't build
anything permanent here.

29:13.233 --> 29:15.567
Because every year,
this is completely underwater.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.167
If I had to
take it down and move it

29:18.200 --> 29:19.667
or if I needed
firewood for burning,

29:19.700 --> 29:22.333
this would be down
in probably 20 minutes.

29:23.133 --> 29:24.700
That's the way I like it.

29:26.967 --> 29:28.567
Uh, this is recycled rope,

29:28.600 --> 29:31.433
probably costs me less than
a gallon of gas.

29:31.467 --> 29:33.267
When it came to
using the chainsaw,

29:33.300 --> 29:35.867
probably cost me
10 gallons in gas

29:35.900 --> 29:38.067
to go get the trees
from up the river.

29:38.067 --> 29:41.467
So I would say it costs
me 100 bucks probably,
and my time, of course.

29:43.233 --> 29:45.300
It's coming along
like it should be.

29:53.367 --> 29:54.500
These are sheets of plywood

29:54.533 --> 29:56.367
that we collected
up off the coast.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.300
If you go down the coast,
and there's a sheet of plywood

29:58.333 --> 29:59.767
sitting by the side
of the beach,

29:59.800 --> 30:01.833
you tend to
throw it in your boat.

30:01.867 --> 30:04.767
Two summers I accumulated
11 sheets of plywood.

30:06.033 --> 30:07.500
Yeah.

30:08.167 --> 30:10.167
I can handle that.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.100
Well, a fellow can certainly
look around at the Kiwalik

30:13.133 --> 30:15.600
a little better from up here.

30:15.633 --> 30:19.067
This is an excellent perch
in the middle of an
excellent hunting place.

30:22.067 --> 30:24.400
I'm gonna
box this in basically.

30:24.433 --> 30:27.200
Whenever we want in the cache,
we'll just have to untie
the front board,

30:27.233 --> 30:30.967
and drop it down,
take out whatever it is
we're looking for.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.567
We spend so much
time here at this camp,

30:32.600 --> 30:34.767
that this is worth
leaving behind.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.400
This should
work out pretty good.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.600
GLENN: I'm not out here
for the isolation,

30:41.633 --> 30:43.033
but it goes
with the territory.

30:43.067 --> 30:46.133
I'm out here
for nature and wilderness.

30:46.167 --> 30:47.833
Where there's much
wilderness left,

30:47.867 --> 30:49.667
there aren't
a whole lot of people.

31:04.767 --> 31:08.067
Maybe I should put another
piece of wood on the fire.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.467
Fall's short up here.

31:09.500 --> 31:12.067
It's about a month long,
and then it can be winter.

31:13.833 --> 31:16.333
Then all of a sudden,
there's snow
over all the land.

31:18.233 --> 31:21.367
The resources
just aren't here year round.

31:21.400 --> 31:25.067
You might want to live in the
moment, but you have to plan
for the future to a degree.

31:25.067 --> 31:26.567
There's no doubt about that.

31:29.067 --> 31:32.100
I remember the first time
I ever camped at this lake.

31:32.133 --> 31:33.400
That was...

31:33.433 --> 31:36.233
Must have been
13 or 14 years ago.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.467
It was like I just found

31:38.500 --> 31:43.100
a perfect little spot
for me out here.

31:43.133 --> 31:45.433
I just thought
it was like paradise here.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.700
(SIZZLING)

31:50.767 --> 31:52.333
Tasty looking.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.067
Whitefish, mmm.

32:00.433 --> 32:01.767
Really tasty.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.567
Days are getting shorter.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.667
My favourite time of the year
is just around the corner.

32:23.467 --> 32:26.500
In another month from now,
I'll be hunting moose.

32:27.567 --> 32:30.633
I'll be real busy
with plenty of work

32:30.667 --> 32:34.167
to do at that time, so I don't
want to think about firewood.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.100
I don't want to think about
building a ladder.

32:36.133 --> 32:38.133
This is the time
to get all that taken care of,

32:38.167 --> 32:41.067
so I got my ladder built,
chimney clean.

32:41.733 --> 32:43.667
Got some wood cut.

32:43.700 --> 32:46.833
I'm going to be well prepared
to take advantage
of the hunting season,

32:46.867 --> 32:48.700
my favourite time of the year.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.100
Go out and get a moose,

32:50.133 --> 32:51.833
and I won't have to
think about firewood,

32:51.867 --> 32:54.200
and these jobs that
I'm taking care of now.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.100
SUE: I'm already
worried about winter.

33:04.133 --> 33:06.300
I've got to think
all of the time.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.567
How can I get
what I need to survive?

33:26.967 --> 33:29.167
NARRATOR: With the
mosquitoes dying down,

33:29.200 --> 33:31.267
and the caribou
herd migrating,

33:31.300 --> 33:35.367
Sue must seize every chance
to stock up for winter.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.767
SUE: I am an opportunist.
We all are when we
live out in the bush.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.067
The opportunity to get meat,
sure you're gonna do it.

33:52.867 --> 33:54.933
There he is.

33:54.967 --> 33:57.600
I gotta be very careful,
I'm close to camp.

33:59.133 --> 34:03.967
If we stay low,
there's a chance they could
cross this direction.

34:04.067 --> 34:06.200
So let's get
closer to the bush.

34:10.633 --> 34:12.233
Camp is here.

34:13.367 --> 34:14.967
We're here.

34:15.067 --> 34:16.800
The caribou
are between the two.

34:17.933 --> 34:20.767
-Do we have clients in camp?
-Yes.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.567
Do you know? Can you tell
exactly where they're at?

34:23.600 --> 34:24.833
No.

34:24.867 --> 34:27.500
All right, so what is
the one direction
we can't shoot?

34:29.800 --> 34:32.333
We can't compromise the
safety of other people, huh?

34:32.367 --> 34:33.567
-Yeah.
-SUE: It would have been good

34:33.600 --> 34:36.400
had it
been the right direction, huh?

34:36.433 --> 34:38.200
You're guaranteed
an opportunity to hunt,

34:38.233 --> 34:40.167
but you gotta
do it wisely, huh?

34:40.200 --> 34:44.067
We've got a little meat in
the freezer we gotta take
care of, so let's go do it.

34:44.667 --> 34:45.567
You know what,

34:45.600 --> 34:47.633
proud of you for
that decision, man.

34:47.667 --> 34:50.200
Sometimes all's you get out
of the hunting experience

34:50.233 --> 34:52.433
is a good stalk
or a good stretch of the legs.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.600
Anything that way?

34:56.633 --> 34:59.400
-Just right about there.
-Right about there? Okay.

34:59.433 --> 35:02.167
That's the direction
we can shoot in, huh?

35:02.200 --> 35:04.300
So you wanna try
and go over there?
Is that a clear shot?

35:04.333 --> 35:05.800
-Yeah, it is.
-You wanna try
and sneak on them

35:05.833 --> 35:07.133
-and see how far it is?
-Yeah.

35:07.167 --> 35:08.800
All right.

35:08.833 --> 35:10.233
Just keep low.

35:11.367 --> 35:13.433
That's an awful
tough location.

35:16.867 --> 35:18.400
Come on, Nathan.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.733
You're gonna have to
hang onto the brush.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.567
I need sticks.

35:43.767 --> 35:47.167
Gotta get a clear shot
without him being
in the water.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.733
(GUNSHOT FIRES)

35:49.700 --> 35:51.133
I can't see him,
where'd he go?

35:51.167 --> 35:52.833
He dropped to the ground.

35:52.867 --> 35:54.067
SUE: Another one down.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.600
That was the way
to take a caribou down, man.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.067
Well, he's another decent one.

36:02.567 --> 36:04.367
This guy has a big rack.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.533
Get up his belly.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.267
I'm putting my knife

36:11.300 --> 36:15.533
in between
this fascia area and the skin.

36:15.567 --> 36:19.067
What you want to do,
you feel their muscles,

36:19.067 --> 36:22.233
and that's kind of
where you want to cut.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.233
NATHAN: I do enjoy
watching my grandma hunt,

36:24.267 --> 36:25.667
and I do learn from it.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.600
I do feel like I'm learning
many things.

36:28.633 --> 36:30.500
It was pretty amazing.

36:30.533 --> 36:32.267
SUE: My grandson
came up to visit,

36:32.300 --> 36:34.567
I got to spend
quality time with him,

36:34.600 --> 36:37.333
help teach him some skills
that he didn't have.

36:39.067 --> 36:40.833
Meat paw.

36:40.867 --> 36:43.800
This thaw season has seen
the end of my first year
being a business owner.

36:46.167 --> 36:47.867
It's been good,
clients in and out.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.600
Thank you.

36:49.633 --> 36:51.900
SUE: I've learned a lot.
I've learned that I have
a lot more to learn.

36:51.933 --> 36:53.767
And there's been epic fails.

36:55.267 --> 36:58.367
No, no, no, no, no...
(SCREAMS)

37:00.867 --> 37:02.433
Ah!

37:02.467 --> 37:03.633
Mother!

37:04.700 --> 37:06.767
But there's been epic rewards.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.267
-(GUNSHOT FIRES)
-Got it.

37:09.133 --> 37:12.167
Yes! It's working. Yay, me.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.833
(GUNSHOT FIRES)

37:13.867 --> 37:14.933
Thank you very much.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.500
You'll be
some tasty little meat.

37:16.533 --> 37:18.767
But that's life. Whoo!

37:21.067 --> 37:22.667
All's I can say
about this winter

37:22.700 --> 37:23.867
is bring it on, motherfucker.

37:23.900 --> 37:25.067
I'm ready for it.

37:25.067 --> 37:26.767
This next year's
gonna be a blast.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.800
ANDY: Every day's an
experiment out here.

37:34.833 --> 37:37.400
The only thing you can
really rely on is yourself

37:37.433 --> 37:38.967
and your skills,

37:39.067 --> 37:41.567
and your creativity
with those skills.

37:53.067 --> 37:54.600
KATE: I can't even imagine

37:54.633 --> 37:58.567
what would happen
if this place burned down.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.233
-Fingers crossed.
-All right,
let's give it a shot.

38:01.267 --> 38:03.700
Three, two, one, go.

38:03.733 --> 38:05.700
-(SCREAMS)
-Whoo-hoo.

38:06.667 --> 38:08.200
(LAUGHS)

38:08.233 --> 38:11.100
Oh, my...
I think I had a heart attack.

38:11.133 --> 38:13.567
-We got a little fire going.
-Yep.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.333
All in all, kind of
a disappointing summer.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.067
Nothing in this end.

38:19.067 --> 38:20.933
The fishing was disappointing.

38:20.967 --> 38:22.467
That ain't working.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.233
The cabin project didn't get
nearly the amount of time

38:25.267 --> 38:26.600
that I had hoped it would.

38:27.867 --> 38:30.067
Almost every day it rained.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.733
But you never know
on the Yukon River.

38:31.767 --> 38:35.100
Things can go from
really easy to really bad

38:35.133 --> 38:36.800
in about two hours.

38:37.633 --> 38:39.567
Yeah, baby.

38:39.600 --> 38:43.500
There's a definitive timeline,
and that's winter.

38:43.533 --> 38:46.067
When winter hits,
everything stops.

38:47.333 --> 38:48.600
If you didn't get it done,

38:48.633 --> 38:50.833
you wait another year
to get it done.

38:50.867 --> 38:52.800
I don't think I've ever

38:52.833 --> 38:56.933
gone into winter completely
finished with all the projects
or all the things on my list,

38:56.967 --> 39:01.667
but my whole reason
for living out here
is to live with the land.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.400
So to do it well,
you just gotta get your
ass up in the morning.

39:04.433 --> 39:07.600
You gotta get out there
and do what you gotta do.

39:17.667 --> 39:19.067
Whoo!

39:21.133 --> 39:22.633
KATE: Bye-bye, garbage.

39:27.367 --> 39:29.633
CHIP: I like
getting up every day,

39:29.667 --> 39:32.133
getting absolutely filthy,
dirty, bloody, muddy,

39:32.167 --> 39:34.067
and sweaty wet.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.100
Going home, cleaning up,
getting up the next day

39:36.133 --> 39:37.667
and doing it again.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.167
Well, I imagine if we're
gonna pack stuff up,

39:47.200 --> 39:49.567
what I need to do is make
a better ladder
up to the cache.

39:49.600 --> 39:53.067
You guys take this apart,
take everything
out of here, and dry it out.

39:53.067 --> 39:55.533
When it's all good and dry,
we're gonna wrap it up
and pack it up,

39:55.567 --> 39:57.400
and by then
I'll have the cache ready.

39:57.433 --> 39:59.233
We'll put it in the cache,
and pack it away.

39:59.267 --> 40:00.500
And then we can
get out of here.

40:00.533 --> 40:03.700
We'll be Kiwalik to
Kobuk River Express.

40:03.733 --> 40:05.700
We always
hate leaving this place,

40:05.733 --> 40:08.933
but we have more things
to go do closer to home.

40:08.967 --> 40:10.633
We've gathered lots of meat,
lots of food,

40:10.667 --> 40:12.000
and now it's time to go home.

40:12.033 --> 40:13.467
We're starting to get
darkness now,

40:13.500 --> 40:16.967
so basically
our summer is over
and our fall is here.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.033
It's not sad to be
leaving here, but I ain't glad
to be leaving here.

40:20.067 --> 40:21.300
This is just
wonderful country.

40:21.333 --> 40:22.667
AGNES: So we have a whole day

40:22.700 --> 40:24.367
of just
cleaning up camp today.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.567
Getting all our stuff dried
out and emptying this teepee

40:27.600 --> 40:30.033
so we can go on ahead
and collapse it

40:30.067 --> 40:33.367
and put it up in the new cache
Chip built for us.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.533
Yeah, that'll work.

40:38.567 --> 40:40.833
Okay, empty.

40:40.867 --> 40:43.700
It's very educational for the
girls to come down here.

40:43.733 --> 40:46.500
It's always a good investment
and good learning process.

40:46.533 --> 40:47.900
You know, we're always
getting ready,

40:47.933 --> 40:49.600
always getting ready
for the next season.

40:49.633 --> 40:51.800
All of summer is just
nothing but a
preparation for winter ahead,

40:51.833 --> 40:54.233
and the winter's nothing
but a preparation
for the summer ahead.

41:04.300 --> 41:06.400
We're basically gonna leave
this here for the next time.

41:06.433 --> 41:08.533
And there will be a next time,
I'm sure.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.333
All we got to do is move
everything over

41:13.367 --> 41:15.400
-and we're ready to go.
-Yep.

41:15.433 --> 41:17.933
I always feel like
I'm never done here.

41:17.967 --> 41:19.167
There's just so much to do,

41:19.200 --> 41:21.533
there's so much
excitement around.

41:21.567 --> 41:24.533
Have to bring everything
to the cache and secure it.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.067
It took all the family
to work together

41:29.067 --> 41:31.500
and managed to
put it all away today.

41:32.967 --> 41:34.767
We're all stored
and ready to go.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.967
CHIP: I'm gonna put
the front door on
and call it good.

41:37.067 --> 41:39.600
Okay.

41:39.633 --> 41:42.500
CHIP: Everything we own
except for our boating stuff
is in the cache.

41:47.067 --> 41:49.067
Tighten it all down real good.

41:51.733 --> 41:54.167
I call this cache done.

41:54.200 --> 41:57.467
Ready for next season
in the Kiwalik.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.667
And the one after that
and the one after that.

42:02.067 --> 42:04.433
The girls
got to catch caribou.

42:04.467 --> 42:05.567
Ooh, ooh.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.600
They got to go out
and catch geese.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.133
They got to
catch salmon in the nets.

42:12.167 --> 42:13.800
They got to go egging.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.767
They got to learn
how to look for smelts.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.533
Not only did they
learn and observe,

42:19.567 --> 42:22.533
but they got to put
hands on and participate.

42:22.567 --> 42:26.067
And my daughter Qutan
can cut a salmon now
just as good as I can.

42:29.100 --> 42:34.067
Well, if we're gonna do any
travelling tonight, we better
get started with it.

42:34.100 --> 42:36.667
Let's go, Carol.
Pull it in, Qutan.

42:37.867 --> 42:40.100
We got a big ocean to cross,
a big sound to cross,

42:40.133 --> 42:41.633
and then we have
a big lake to cross.

42:42.500 --> 42:43.833
Okay, we're loaded.

42:43.867 --> 42:44.967
Just the adventure
and the health

42:45.067 --> 42:47.367
that came out of it
is worth every penny.

42:48.433 --> 42:49.967
The whole summer's turned out.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.500
AGNES: Yeah, ready, girls,
to go home?

42:52.533 --> 42:54.567
Home sweet home?

42:54.600 --> 42:56.500
Gonna be a long ride.

42:57.433 --> 42:58.633
Yeah.
