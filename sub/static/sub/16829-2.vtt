00:01.435 --> 00:03.569
(Wind whooshing)

00:03.571 --> 00:07.439
Sylvester: Walter? Walter,
can you hear me? Walter?

00:07.441 --> 00:08.574
(Screams)

00:08.576 --> 00:10.542
Sly, what's happening?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.611
You're 5.5 miles
above the ocean,

00:12.613 --> 00:14.513
falling at roughly
53 meters per second

00:14.515 --> 00:16.448
without a parachute!

00:16.450 --> 00:18.550
Okay, this is where a plan
would be useful.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.785
Please tell me you have one!

00:21.155 --> 00:22.654
Male voice (Recorded):
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:28.027
Feel all stress leave your body.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.731
Inhale through the feet.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.168
Exhale from the crown.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.670
A biological impossibility.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.173
Doesn't mean it literally.
It's a metaphor.

00:41.175 --> 00:44.209
Makes him sound like an idiot.
That's a simile.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.713
Cleanse your mind
of all thought.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.181
(Scoffs) Impossible.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.649
The brain is
constantly thinking,

00:50.651 --> 00:51.750
even during sleep.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.053
In fact, a 2013 study found

00:54.055 --> 00:56.555
neural activity
in deep-coma subjects.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.290
(Exhales)

00:58.292 --> 01:00.292
You both said you would
give this a chance.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.795
We are here for relaxation.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.630
Sorry.
Sorry.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.499
And we will find Serenity,
even if it kills us.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.369
(Electrical crackling)

01:10.371 --> 01:12.337
Male voice:
Scan your body

01:12.339 --> 01:15.674
for all pockets of negativity,
and release it.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.610
What's going on?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.646
Oh, welding solar panels.

01:20.648 --> 01:23.315
I thought we could go a little
green, save a little green.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.017
No, with the dali-lame-a's.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.718
Oh, Walt is tense about
Paige dating Tim,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.754
Toby's tense about...
Your secret husband?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.622
Yeah, and it all
stresses sly out big time,

01:30.624 --> 01:31.790
so hence the hokum.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.158
Don't knock meditation.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.660
Even the marines
are using it these days.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.295
Why don't you pull up
a mat, then?

01:36.297 --> 01:38.230
Male voice:
Inhale white light.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.465
(Inhales deeply)

01:39.467 --> 01:41.166
Pass.

01:41.168 --> 01:44.169
Hold for three seconds.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.271
Exhale black smoke.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.740
Three seconds?
That was barely 2.38 seconds.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.209
Thought we were supposed
to relax.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.112
You're right, uh...
I'm going to reset it.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.613
Okay...
(Door opens)

01:54.615 --> 01:55.814
Tim, there is no way.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.449
No, I'm telling you,
i think that she is.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.851
Son of a bee sting.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.185
Paige:
Guys, settle this for us.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.587
Tim swears
the "where's the beef" lady

02:01.589 --> 02:03.155
is the same woman as

02:03.157 --> 02:04.656
the "I've fallen,
and I can't get up" lady.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.525
Thank goodness.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.627
I was worried it might be
about something trivial.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.729
If I'm wrong,
i gotta buy dinner, so...

02:10.731 --> 02:12.664
No, if you're wrong,
you have to cook dinner,

02:12.666 --> 02:14.600
including your
blueberry crumble.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.535
This guy can bake.
It's like heaven in a pie tin.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.203
Well, I have a project
to work on.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.340
(Humming a tune)

02:25.179 --> 02:26.678
This is your urgent project?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.282
Actually, yes, it's...
It's our garage floor plan.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.967
Triple-a.

02:31.968 --> 02:33.651
I assume this has nothing to do
with your car insurance.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.187
It's my "active
avoidance algorithm."

02:35.189 --> 02:37.156
I track the typical
daily movements of Paige,

02:37.158 --> 02:39.191
indicated here with a "p."
I assumed.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.360
And Tim.
"I"?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.762
Interloper.
Oh.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.330
Anyway, areas where
they typically interact

02:45.332 --> 02:47.466
have exclamation points,

02:47.468 --> 02:49.668
and the numbers denote duration.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.603
So, for example,
at 2:00 P.M.,

02:51.605 --> 02:54.406
Paige and Timothy
congregate in the kitchen

02:54.408 --> 02:55.874
for coffee and banal banter

02:55.876 --> 02:57.576
for about eight minutes
and 36 seconds.

02:57.578 --> 03:00.946
Now, from my desk, I would have
an unobstructed view,

03:00.948 --> 03:02.414
and that kind of irks me.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.482
Kind of?
Anyway...

03:03.484 --> 03:04.683
But thanks to triple-a,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.785
I know to be here,
at the monitor tree,

03:06.787 --> 03:08.787
where I occupy myself with work

03:08.789 --> 03:11.073
until they're separated.

03:11.074 --> 03:13.358
Now, this map identifies
36 such hot spots.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.428
Hmm. You know, some
world-class behaviorists,

03:16.430 --> 03:18.564
like me, might say
this will drive you crazy

03:18.566 --> 03:20.666
if it hasn't already.
Oh, you're one to talk.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.534
You're avoiding
the happy situation.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.802
Just because I've
stopped hounding her

03:23.804 --> 03:25.504
does not mean I'm avoiding it.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.306
Check this out.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.608
What is this?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.311
That's a dossier
of all my suspects.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.213
Any one of these bozos could
be happy's mystery spouse.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.214
Hold on.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.716
Ray?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.217
He was in our lives,
then he left.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.851
Maybe he's
commitment-phobic.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.821
The point is, where you're
avoiding your problems,

03:42.823 --> 03:44.856
I'm meeting mine
head-on, Walt.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.392
You got the triple-a,
I'm doing the triple-h.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.830
Hunting happy's husband.
Paige: Hey, guys.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.666
Um... hi.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.835
Am I interrupting something?
Both: Nope.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.769
Okay, uh, Richard elia's
downstairs.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.571
I think he has a job for us.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.806
Cool.
Cool.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.708
Okay.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.846
My company has our first
manned space launch

04:07.848 --> 04:09.715
in three days.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.750
Make a few orbits,
then splash down.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.353
Routine stuff, bit it's
make or break for us.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.787
We have to meet this deadline,

04:15.789 --> 04:18.457
or we lose our next
round of funding,

04:18.459 --> 04:21.727
and NASA gives our contracts
to space x or virgin galactic.

04:21.729 --> 04:22.761
What do you need from scorpion?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.464
Well, recognize this?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.533
That's Walter's throttle design.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.335
After you so generously
open-sourced

04:30.337 --> 04:31.837
your rocket research,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.573
my guys adapted some of your
best thinking to our bird.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.708
Walt's throttle's
revolutionary.
That's what I thought,

04:36.710 --> 04:38.343
but it doesn't work.
Sylvester:
I can assure you

04:38.345 --> 04:40.279
we have empirical
evidence that it does.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.780
I know that your private
beach launch

04:41.782 --> 04:43.348
last Christmas was successful,

04:43.350 --> 04:45.751
but when we scaled it up
to a much larger rocket,

04:45.753 --> 04:47.786
we found some
instability issues.

04:51.692 --> 04:52.875
Take a look.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.059
Hey, I know you guys
saved elia's daughter

04:54.061 --> 04:55.694
from a cartel last year,

04:55.696 --> 04:57.963
but didn't Walter
also wreck his Ferrari

04:57.965 --> 05:00.065
and burn his building
to the ground?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.833
Uh, well, the Ferrari
was one of nine,

05:01.835 --> 05:03.568
so I'm pretty sure
he didn't miss it.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.903
And, um, the building
wasn't our fault.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.806
Oh.
Although Walter did
hit elia over the head

05:07.808 --> 05:09.641
with his laptop that day.
Really?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.643
(Whispering):
I don't put everything
in the case summaries.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.811
These numbers can't be right.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.646
You dumb engineers screwed up.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.081
I'd be happy if you
could prove them wrong.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.749
Walter, time is of the essence,

05:17.751 --> 05:19.618
and I'm more than willing
to pay a premium.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.025
Sylvester:
Fuel levels are looking good.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.694
You're go for testing, guys.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.362
Happy:
No way the problem's
your throttle.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.797
I bet it's their valve system.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.532
Well, we'll soon find out.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.673
So this contract you're
competing for, what is it?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.475
Giving rides to NASA
until they get their own

05:43.477 --> 05:44.910
manned program
back up and running?

05:44.912 --> 05:46.428
It's like "space uber."

05:46.429 --> 05:47.945
Our sights are set
a little higher.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.781
Private companies like ours
are the future

05:49.783 --> 05:50.949
of space exploration.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.851
See, we intend to take the next

05:52.853 --> 05:54.953
giant leap for mankind.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.055
Put a man on Mars.
Or a woman.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.358
A whole colony, actually.
And Walter's throttle

05:59.360 --> 06:00.525
could play a big part.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.993
That's why I saw the
news Van outside.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.762
A little PR for your
company's ego?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.464
A little PR never
hurt anybody, Toby.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.065
Besides, scorpion should
get some good press

06:07.067 --> 06:08.600
if Walter can get
everything going.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.435
He'll fix it.
He always does.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.738
Walter:
Diagnostics complete.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.039
Checking the results.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.575
Happy:
Told you.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.844
Elia, your engineers'
redundant valve system

06:18.846 --> 06:19.945
is destroying

06:19.947 --> 06:21.580
Walt's throttle ratio.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.115
Our experts advised us
to put that in

06:23.117 --> 06:24.916
to protect against
standard instability

06:24.918 --> 06:26.507
below 60% of thrust.

06:26.508 --> 06:28.097
Walter:
There won't be the instability,

06:28.098 --> 06:29.687
and I can prove it;
Just let me undo what you did

06:29.690 --> 06:31.774
and run some tests.

06:31.775 --> 06:33.859
I'll head to mission control,
pick up the proper valves.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.894
Elia: Looks like you guys
are gonna be here for a while.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.462
I'll have my assistant
order lunch.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.731
Is Greek okay?
Anything's fine.
Thank you.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.434
As long as it has an "a" rating
from the board of health.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.002
Understood.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.905
You sure you're okay
with Greek food?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.874
Might make you emotional.
Oh, shut up.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.543
We rented an indie
Greek film last night,

06:51.545 --> 06:53.445
and I might have cried.
Yeah, she tried
to hide it.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.880
Paige: It was romantic.
I can't help it.

06:54.882 --> 06:55.981
True love always makes me cry.

06:55.983 --> 06:56.982
It was one tear.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.017
It was sweet, like you.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.819
Yeah, right.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.088
Female computer voice:
Intercom off.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.023
Take that. (Mutters)

07:05.025 --> 07:06.892
You're such a man, Tim.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.827
(Muttering)

07:08.829 --> 07:11.129
Sly, what does the radar
look like?

07:11.131 --> 07:12.664
On it.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.901
Oh, boy, big storm coming in.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.702
Happy: Rockets are giant
lightning rods.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.438
We better get Walt out
of that tin can.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.939
Hey, Walt, you hear
that weather report?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.974
Sly:
Hello? Walter?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.743
You copy, kid?

07:24.745 --> 07:25.877
Walter!

07:25.879 --> 07:27.646
Ah, the triple-a.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.880
What-what does that mean?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.615
That means he took his comm out.

07:31.585 --> 07:32.884
What about the capsule's radio?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.820
Must have turned that off, too.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.054
Happy, it'd probably be prudent

07:36.056 --> 07:37.989
for you to go back there
and get him out

07:37.991 --> 07:39.024
until this storm clears.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.091
Roger that.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.095
(Thunder rumbling)

07:45.899 --> 07:47.132
(Thunder crashing)

07:47.134 --> 07:48.494
(Electrical crackling
and sizzling)

07:50.637 --> 07:52.003
(Alarm blaring)

07:52.005 --> 07:54.039
Oh, boy, oh, boy oh, boy!

07:54.041 --> 07:55.874
Elia: What's happening?
The engines fired,

07:55.876 --> 07:57.192
and I can't shut 'em down.

07:57.193 --> 07:58.509
Lightning must have
struck the connections.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.778
Did Walter do it on his end?

07:59.780 --> 08:01.580
Sylvester:
<i>Not likely.</i>

08:01.582 --> 08:03.014
<i>The fact that they
are firing proves</i>

08:03.016 --> 08:04.783
that the lightning struck
the open circuit

08:04.785 --> 08:05.851
that Walter was working on.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.052
The whole thing got fried.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.620
That sucker is gonna launch.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.021
Guys, that sucker's
gonna launch.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.606
Oh, man,
this sucker's gonna launch.

08:11.607 --> 08:13.190
There's an escape slide
if he can exit the hatch,

08:13.193 --> 08:14.793
cross the gantry
and get into the bunker.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.595
Wait, does Walter
have time for that?

08:16.597 --> 08:17.963
Sylvester:
<i>Math is not in his favor.</i>

08:17.965 --> 08:19.798
He needs to make a decision.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.668
Female computer voice:
T-minus 25 seconds to launch.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.206
He's shutting the hatch.
'Cause if it launches
without it sealed, he's dead.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.975
He's gotta strap in.
When that thing goes up,

08:29.977 --> 08:31.276
inertia will pin him down,

08:31.277 --> 08:32.576
make him feel three
times his weight.

08:32.579 --> 08:35.013
Female computer voice:
T-minus 15 seconds.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.284
T-minus ten seconds.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.821
Nine, eight, seven...

08:43.757 --> 08:46.057
T-minus five, four...

08:46.059 --> 08:47.993
Female computer voice:
Three, two,

08:47.995 --> 08:49.961
one...

08:49.963 --> 08:52.030
(Tires squeal)

08:55.002 --> 08:56.768
Not good.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.015
(Alarm blaring)

09:10.017 --> 09:11.616
Cabe:
<i>We gotta raise Walter</i>
<i>on the radio.</i>

09:11.618 --> 09:13.218
He has got bigger problems
than communications

09:13.220 --> 09:15.186
if he wants to survive
the next few minutes.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.055
What problems?
Problem number one:

09:17.057 --> 09:18.623
Systems control.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.225
The telemetry of the rocket
is a mess.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.760
The lightning strike
scrambled the computers.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.128
Lightning struck
<i>Apollo 12</i> during launch.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.630
Control came back on
when the astronauts

09:25.632 --> 09:27.632
switched to auxiliary
and the computers rebooted.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.266
Does Walter know about that?

09:28.268 --> 09:29.267
I sure as hell hope so.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.304
(Alarm blaring)

09:34.074 --> 09:37.909
(Strained grunting)

09:37.911 --> 09:39.578
(Computer buzzing and trilling)

09:39.580 --> 09:41.313
Toby: <i>And if he gets
the computers restarted,</i>

09:41.315 --> 09:42.948
<i>then he can deal with</i>

09:42.950 --> 09:45.317
problem number two,
atmospheric pressure.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.453
If he doesn't
pressurize the cabin

09:47.454 --> 09:49.588
as the capsule gets higher,
his blood will literally boil.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.623
How much time does he have?
Less than a minute.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.291
Button's in the copilot panel,
three seats in that capsule.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.893
Let's hope Walter
jumped in the right one.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.728
(Alarm blaring)

10:00.601 --> 10:01.666
(Grunts)

10:06.907 --> 10:08.907
Can he breathe up there?
Oxygen is involved

10:08.909 --> 10:11.276
in pressurizing the cabin
so the systems are connected.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.978
<i>If Walter can get
to that button in time,</i>

10:12.980 --> 10:13.979
<i>he'll have plenty of fresh air.</i>

10:13.981 --> 10:15.380
If not...

10:29.730 --> 10:31.262
Do you have an abort button?
Yes.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.831
And if we abort,

10:32.833 --> 10:36.234
Walter's capsule separates
from the rocket,

10:36.236 --> 10:38.336
parachutes deploy from there,
and he just...

10:38.338 --> 10:40.672
Falls back to earth
safe and sound.
Yes.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.641
Then just do it already!
We can't until Walt

10:42.643 --> 10:44.109
gets the computers back up.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.377
That brings us
to problem number three.

10:45.379 --> 10:46.678
What's problem number three?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.146
The abort window's closing.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.681
That's problem three.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.750
He has to abort before
the rocket goes into space,

10:51.752 --> 10:54.886
and he can't do that until
the rocket's computers reboot.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.755
(Panting):
I have to abort.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.089
Come on! Come on!

10:58.091 --> 11:00.191
(Groans)

11:00.193 --> 11:02.794
(Grunting)

11:08.201 --> 11:09.434
(Beeping)

11:11.738 --> 11:13.004
(Electronic whirring
and trilling)

11:13.006 --> 11:15.140
Walter's computer's back on.
I'm hitting abort!

11:17.678 --> 11:18.677
Come on, come on!

11:18.679 --> 11:20.779
(Beeping)

11:20.781 --> 11:21.780
Oh, no. Oh, no.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.282
I can't abort. I can't abort!

11:24.284 --> 11:26.685
Guys, guys!
Don't press the button.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.153
Don't press the button.
(Grunts)

11:29.423 --> 11:30.955
(Beeping)

11:30.957 --> 11:32.123
No, no, no, no!

11:32.125 --> 11:34.059
No!
(Yells)
What the hell?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.878
Lightning fried
the parachute package.

11:35.879 --> 11:38.079
If we abort the capsule
without a chute, we kill Walter.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.967
(Beep)
(Relieved sigh, then chuckles)

11:42.969 --> 11:45.270
Good work, guys.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.405
Okay, I'm getting data from the
medical sensors in the seats.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.274
Walter's still alive,

11:49.275 --> 11:51.142
so we got that going
for us, which is nice.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.410
What happens now,
he just keeps traveling

11:52.412 --> 11:54.079
into outer space forever?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.747
No, the rocket was designed
to blast the capsule

11:55.749 --> 11:58.349
into a low-earth orbit
and then stop.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.751
Which means?

11:59.752 --> 12:01.152
It means Walter
is reaching space right now.

12:01.154 --> 12:04.055
And the capsule is detaching
as we speak.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.429
<i>But the rocket was only fueled
two thirds to capacity</i>

12:11.431 --> 12:12.897
<i>for the test,
which is not enough</i>

12:12.899 --> 12:14.332
<i>to maintain a stable orbit.</i>

12:14.334 --> 12:16.735
So the capsule is in
a decaying orbit

12:16.737 --> 12:18.503
and will crash to the earth

12:18.505 --> 12:20.505
in 26 hours.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.074
And he'll die because
the capsule has no parachutes.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.409
That's about the size of it.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.978
Problem number four,
get Walter home.

12:26.980 --> 12:30.115
How? His ride's busted.
It's not like he can hitchhike.
Happy: Not necessarily.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.816
The international space
station's escape pod

12:31.818 --> 12:32.917
could pick up Walt.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.819
Sly?
Pulling it up now.

12:34.821 --> 12:36.488
Won't work. Iss is on
the other side of the earth.

12:36.490 --> 12:37.889
Check out the dor log.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.324
There's a Russian iss

12:39.326 --> 12:41.159
resupply rocket
launching in a week.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.495
And our capsule conforms to
international docking standards.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.764
We convince them
to move up their timeline,

12:45.766 --> 12:47.298
dock with Walter
and bring him back home.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.933
(In Russian accent):
Hey, Vladimir, on way home,

12:48.935 --> 12:52.270
please pick up vodka,
borscht and 150-pound irishman?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.905
(Normal voice): Are you kidding?
These are Russians.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.007
Why would they change their
schedule to help uncle Sam?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.342
'Cause then we'd owe 'em one.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.977
You take Paige,

12:58.979 --> 13:00.662
go to the Russian consulate.

13:00.663 --> 13:02.346
Throw homeland's weight around,
and see what you can get done.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.549
Copy that.
Keep us posted.
Absolutely.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.484
Speaking of keeping us posted,

13:06.486 --> 13:09.187
that takes me to problem
number five, communication.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.556
Take a look at the damage
done to the rocket.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.158
When the rocket ripped
from the tower

13:13.160 --> 13:15.293
during blastoff,
a piece of debris

13:15.295 --> 13:16.828
must have fallen into
the communication array.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.030
We cannot talk to Walter.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.431
What about Walter's comms?

13:26.873 --> 13:28.807
(Sighing):
Okay.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.479
Anyone hear me? Oh...

13:34.481 --> 13:36.181
Of course you can't.
Happy:
<i>Comms are a no go.</i>

13:36.183 --> 13:37.315
The capsule has
radiation shielding,

13:37.317 --> 13:38.583
which blocks the signal.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.552
Well, then, what about
an air force awacs plane?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.887
A big communications bird like
that could more than make up

13:42.889 --> 13:44.889
for the rocket's
communications array.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.157
And then they could
relay a signal

13:46.159 --> 13:47.525
from the sky back down
to you guys.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.027
My corporate jet's hangared
here, but it doesn't

13:49.029 --> 13:50.962
have the kind of
broadcast equipment you'd need.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.898
Happy:
I know how we can get it.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.520
Okay, cabe, I need a hand.

13:58.521 --> 14:00.881
I need your plane gassed up
and pilot-ready in five minutes.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.075
A story on advancements
in private sector rocketry

14:04.077 --> 14:05.543
has become a cautionary tale

14:05.545 --> 14:07.278
as an unscheduled blastoff

14:07.280 --> 14:09.514
may have launched
a civilian into space.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.083
We have been prevented entry
into mission control

14:12.085 --> 14:13.952
or an audience with...
(Tires screech)

14:19.392 --> 14:20.625
Very subtle, happy.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.896
(Speaking Russian)

14:27.133 --> 14:28.566
My government would be
happy to help.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.002
However, in addition to funding

14:31.004 --> 14:34.606
and technology from Mr. elia
to help move up our launch,

14:34.608 --> 14:36.507
we require one thing.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.976
Which is what?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.945
Credit.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.913
When this mission is over,
we want your president

14:41.915 --> 14:44.082
to make a statement
telling the world how

14:44.084 --> 14:46.017
Russian space program

14:46.019 --> 14:47.652
saved an
American homeland agent.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.420
Yeah, I'm not sure that's
gonna happen...
Done.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.422
We need to consult
with cabe first...

14:51.424 --> 14:54.092
Agent cabe gallo gave me
permission to act on his behalf.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.628
Sir, you a have a deal.
Excellent.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.230
I will leave you to make
the necessary arrangements.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.032
(Clears throat)

15:04.671 --> 15:06.938
What was that?

15:06.939 --> 15:09.206
We can't just agree that the
U.S. is gonna kowtow to Russia.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.508
And we both know that cabe

15:10.510 --> 15:11.643
didn't authorize
you to do anything.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.677
That's right.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.612
So I'm on the hook, not you.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.115
I'd do it for any member
of the team.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.017
Now, make the arrangements.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.394
That was Tim.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.595
Looks like I'm gonna
have to make

15:30.597 --> 15:31.996
an uncomfortable call
to the white house.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.064
Well, I am ready here.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.999
Okay, guys.
Give it a shot.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.467
Okay, connecting to you now.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.635
Happy:
Signal's hot.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.938
Relaying now.
Ok, Toby,

15:39.940 --> 15:43.474
give it a try.
Walter? Walter, do you copy?

15:43.476 --> 15:46.377
Guys... guys, I hear you.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.679
Can you hear me?
We got him.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.380
Yes, Walter, hello.
We can hear you.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.481
I'm zooming in.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.650
Walter, Mr. elia
is very angry,

15:52.652 --> 15:54.218
and he wants his rocket returned

15:54.220 --> 15:55.987
right now, young man.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.223
I'm gonna return it,
just probably not in one piece.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.391
My parachute is shot,

16:00.393 --> 16:02.493
and my orbit is decaying.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.029
I assume you all
know that already.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.732
I figure I've got
25 hours before I crash.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.067
Any ideas?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.568
Yeah, you're gonna bum a ride.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.403
A Russian spacecraft
will be coming

16:12.405 --> 16:14.038
to pick you up
in plenty of time.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.673
Toby:
So sit back, relax,

16:15.675 --> 16:17.175
and enjoy your flight.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.043
I could play you
my meditation app.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.511
No, thanks, um...
(Clanging)

16:20.513 --> 16:23.014
Toby: Hey, Walt, don't forget
to pick me up one of those

16:23.016 --> 16:24.282
"my friend got launched
into space,

16:24.284 --> 16:26.651
and all I got was this
lousy t-shirt" t-shirts.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.486
(Clanging)
Do you guys hear that?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.089
Hear what?
(Clanging continues)

16:36.496 --> 16:38.262
(Clanging)

16:38.264 --> 16:39.998
A clang from the hold.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.266
No, don't copy any clanging.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.434
The hold's empty.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.204
(Banging)

16:52.145 --> 16:53.711
I beg to differ.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.180
Why is he opening the hold?
There's no sound coming from it.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.749
This could be why.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.784
Oxygen tanks must have
taken a hit during launch.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.220
O2 levels are dangerously low.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.354
That doesn't make any sense.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.839
Warning sensors
should've gone off.

17:04.840 --> 17:06.323
Well, not if they
were damaged, too.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.494
Oh, man, that clanging
only exists in his head.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.695
This is bad.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.196
How bad?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.631
If he's having false
sound perceptions,

17:13.633 --> 17:16.034
that means he's already
suffering from hypoxia,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.102
which means that cabe
won't have to make

17:18.104 --> 17:19.604
that uncomfortable call
to the white house,

17:19.606 --> 17:21.439
'cause Walter doesn't have
a day anymore.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.708
If we don't get him oxygen,
he's dead in 32 minutes!

17:23.710 --> 17:25.176
So how do we know if things
are gonna be getting worse?

17:25.178 --> 17:27.211
He'll have full-blown
hallucinations.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.684
Oh, hello.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.186
Let me help you out.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.123
Hello, Walter.
I've missed you.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.124
Guys, why didn't you tell me

17:40.125 --> 17:41.124
that Paige was in
the cargo hold?

17:41.127 --> 17:43.061
I think things just got worse.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.730
And that would be
problem number six.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.770
Hey, Walter... pal...

17:52.772 --> 17:56.441
I need you to sit down,
conserve oxygen

17:56.443 --> 17:58.543
and stop talking
to people who aren't there.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.379
His O2 levels are dropping
at an alarming rate.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.713
He has less than 28 minutes!

18:02.715 --> 18:04.665
Why doesn't he respond?
He can hear.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.616
Sensory cells on his corti
are converting vibrations

18:06.619 --> 18:08.786
into neural messages,
which are carried to his brain.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.321
So, yes, technically
he hears you,

18:10.323 --> 18:11.656
but he doesn't hear you.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.826
Simply put, Walt's taken
a vacation from reality.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.462
Paige:
Oh, wow.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.630
Oh, the view is so beautiful
from here.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.665
It's breathtaking.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.751
I hadn't noticed it.

18:22.752 --> 18:24.836
I'm focused on something
much more lovely.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.573
That is so sweet.
Mm.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.141
And poetic.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.708
I remember everything
you taught me.

18:31.711 --> 18:35.213
My days of not being able to
put it into practice are over.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.781
I can restrain myself

18:36.783 --> 18:39.550
when I hear something
factually inaccurate.

18:39.552 --> 18:43.721
I can engage in small talk,
no matter how insipid.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.456
I can remember
to compliment someone

18:45.458 --> 18:47.892
when I observe something
about their appearance.

18:47.894 --> 18:51.462
For example, you look absolutely
stunning in that outfit.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.830
We really shouldn't
be listening to this.

18:52.832 --> 18:53.798
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.366
He's sick.
Da, da, da.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.801
What he's saying
is making me sick.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.902
Making me sick, too.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.904
Thank you.
Mm.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.572
It's what I wore
when we first kissed.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.241
But you know that because...

19:03.243 --> 19:05.743
You think about that kiss
all the time.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.180
What I wore, my perfume.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.150
How my lips felt.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.851
It's all burned
into your memory.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.753
I have the data stored, yes.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.757
Now, I know you think you know
my limitations...

19:19.759 --> 19:22.293
What I am capable of,

19:22.295 --> 19:24.829
or more accurately,
incapable of.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.531
But...

19:26.533 --> 19:27.932
I can still surprise you.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.234
Really?

19:30.236 --> 19:31.435
Prove it.

It's what I wore

20:09.375 --> 20:10.975
at that art fund-raiser
two years ago.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.843
I never forgot
how you looked in it.

20:12.845 --> 20:13.911
It's a halston.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.746
It should be called a galaxy.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.266

20:36.803 --> 20:38.636
What was that noise?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.338
Just some space debris.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.942
Come here.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.711
I didn't know you could dance.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.779
Just body movements

20:48.781 --> 20:52.316
and physiology
synched to rhythmic patterns.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.285
You know, I am well aware

20:54.286 --> 20:56.253
that with your knowledge
of kinesiology and biology,

20:56.256 --> 20:58.823
you could be as strong as
Tim if you wanted to be.

21:00.526 --> 21:04.028
If I wanted to waste my time
lifting heavy objects

21:04.030 --> 21:06.731
over and over...

21:08.334 --> 21:09.600
But you don't need to do that,

21:09.602 --> 21:11.836
because you're already
lugging around a great,

21:11.838 --> 21:13.704
big brain.

21:14.807 --> 21:19.543
♪ Just as long as I'm your man ♪

21:24.417 --> 21:25.483
Oh.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.988
If Walter knew
we were seeing this,

21:30.990 --> 21:32.623
he'd choose to remain in space.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.825
You're my whole world.

21:34.827 --> 21:37.295
I'm just a moon
that orbits around you.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.797
That's it. Orbiting moon.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.382
That's how we're
gonna save o'brien.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.966
Sylvester: Walter is running
out of oxygen and time.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.369
You need to break it down
quickly.
Happy: He said "moon."

21:45.371 --> 21:46.921
The moon is just a satellite.

21:46.922 --> 21:48.472
Man-made satellites always have
a little bit of fuel

21:48.474 --> 21:49.640
left in their booster rockets.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.742
And they use liquid oxygen
for fuel.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.078
Okay, satellite information
is mostly public information.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.880
I just need to find one
that's going to cross paths

21:55.882 --> 21:56.881
with Walt's capsule.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.416
Oh, I found one. Here.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.584
A Norwegian
telecommunications company.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.653
I'm a little confused
how this is all gonna work.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.955
I'm glad you asked, cabe.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.491
As Walter gets closer
to the satellite,

22:07.493 --> 22:08.826
I will hack said satellite

22:08.828 --> 22:10.661
and use its thrusters
to fly it directly

22:10.663 --> 22:13.064
into the capsule's cargo hold.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.365
Walter releases liquid oxygen,

22:14.367 --> 22:16.434
and as it warms,
it turns to a gas.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.635
He could breathe it in and get
that brain of his working again.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.337
Sounds great,
except for the fact that

22:19.339 --> 22:20.571
I've been watching Walter
dance by himself

22:20.573 --> 22:22.323
for the last two minutes.

22:22.324 --> 22:24.074
For this to work,
he has to be cognizant enough

22:24.077 --> 22:26.510
to release the cargo hold door,
to get to the satellite.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.545
Walter!

22:27.547 --> 22:28.979
Walter, I know you can hear me.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.781
Listen to me, son.

22:30.783 --> 22:31.982
It's no use, cabe.
I'm looking at him.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.751
He's talking to
invisi-Paige.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.486
You can't get through to him.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.487
Whoa. Oh, she can!

22:36.489 --> 22:37.788
What? What'd I... what'd I do?

22:37.790 --> 22:40.524
Not "what did you do,"
but what you are about to do.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.026
You are about to break

22:42.028 --> 22:44.395
the psychotropic grip that
hypoxia has on our boy wonder.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.930
Why is he dancing?

22:45.932 --> 22:48.933
In layman's terms, he's running
out of oxygen and he's loopy.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.535
And the only person
he'll talk to is you,

22:50.536 --> 22:52.136
'cause he thinks that
you're up there with him.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.704
What? Wh-what is he saying?

22:57.143 --> 22:58.776
Things.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.478
Oh, boy.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.813
Paige, you only have
a few minutes, so talk to him

23:02.815 --> 23:04.982
and get him to pull
that big blue lever

23:04.984 --> 23:06.751
that opens the exterior hatch

23:06.753 --> 23:08.452
so sly can guide
a satellite inside.

23:08.454 --> 23:09.520
What if I can't do it?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.756
Then he dies.
But, Paige,

23:11.758 --> 23:13.457
you know how to talk to us.

23:13.459 --> 23:14.725
That's why you're on this team.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.461
We know you can do this.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.064
Okay, everybody out.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.133
Why? What if you
need our help?

23:22.135 --> 23:24.168
This is a private conversation
between me and Walter.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.503
Everybody out.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.570
Clock's ticking. Let's go.
(Claps)

23:26.572 --> 23:28.139
Come on.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.842
You too, happy.
I can hear you over the mics.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.010
Happy:
Damn it.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.879
(Intercom clicks off)

23:37.183 --> 23:39.483
Walter:
I have a surprise for you.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.152
Close your eyes.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.153
Can I open them now?

23:42.155 --> 23:44.488
Yes.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.992
Baked Alaska.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.860
Beats the hell
out of blueberry crumble.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.970
Mmm. Oh.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.539
It's perfect.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.707
It's the most scientifically
interesting dessert.

24:03.709 --> 24:07.011
Air trapped in small meringue
pockets acts as an insulator,

24:07.013 --> 24:08.546
slowing heat transfer.

24:08.548 --> 24:12.550
So the 450-degree oven
does not melt the ice cream.

24:12.552 --> 24:15.453
Can you show me how to make it?

24:15.455 --> 24:16.454
In the oven

24:16.456 --> 24:17.621
in back of the garage?

24:17.623 --> 24:18.756
We could bake together

24:18.758 --> 24:20.524
and have fun,

24:20.526 --> 24:22.460
but we'd...
We'd have to go home first.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.094
Just us?

24:24.096 --> 24:26.597
Just us, just you and me...

24:26.599 --> 24:29.467
...me, but if you want
to go home,

24:29.469 --> 24:30.868
you have to pull the large...

24:30.870 --> 24:34.138
...blue lever near the seat.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.606
That will get you home.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.608
Ah, I see the lever.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.944
You're lying right next
to it on the chaise.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.579
Um, that's right.
It's right...

24:41.581 --> 24:43.647
...next to me.
Yeah.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.183
(Breathing shallowly)

24:46.185 --> 24:47.251
Oh,

24:47.253 --> 24:49.019
wal... Walter.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.087
Are you okay?

24:50.089 --> 24:51.489
Why don't you...

24:51.491 --> 24:52.556
...sit down next to me?

24:53.659 --> 24:55.626
I'm confused.
Well, I know.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.561
It's because you're not getting
enough oxygen.

24:57.563 --> 24:58.803
No, it's 'cause you picked Tim.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.999
I know I can't be what you need.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.834
I know I can't be
emotionally present

25:03.836 --> 25:05.669
the way that you deserve,

25:05.671 --> 25:08.606
but I always thought that...

25:08.608 --> 25:11.041
That eventually,
that you want to...

25:11.043 --> 25:13.143
You want to be with me.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.679
And...

25:15.681 --> 25:16.680
That's why it hurts.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.549
Because...

25:18.551 --> 25:19.550
(Exhales)

25:19.552 --> 25:21.652
...because I love you.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.759
I love you, too, Walter.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.730
And we-we can be together.
You just have to...

25:32.732 --> 25:35.966
...pull that lever,
and it'll be just you and me.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.704
And we'll be together...

25:40.706 --> 25:41.772
Forever.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.309
I don't see the handle,

25:45.311 --> 25:47.445
I just see your hand.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.580
Well, that's what I meant.
Take my hand.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.849
Pull me to you.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.117
Do that, and everything
will be okay, Walter.

25:57.723 --> 25:58.723
Now pull me close.

26:02.628 --> 26:05.896
(Air rushing)

26:05.898 --> 26:08.632
(Sighs)

26:13.806 --> 26:15.039
The hatch is open.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.240
Yes!

26:18.578 --> 26:19.677
That's a good job. You okay?

26:19.679 --> 26:21.712
Yeah.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.180
Great work in there.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.748
Couldn't have been easy.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.716
What'd you have to tell him?

26:25.718 --> 26:28.686
Uh, whatever he needed to hear.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.654
(Sighs)

26:30.656 --> 26:32.289
Okay, I am
into the Norwegian satellite.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.791
Now I just need to manipulate

26:33.793 --> 26:35.326
the thrusters,
and I will be able to

26:35.328 --> 26:37.094
guide it through the external
hatch within minutes.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.663
Walter opens the interior hatch
and the liquid O2 warms to gas

26:39.665 --> 26:41.699
and he stays alive.
I'm not so sure about that.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.734
He can't open the interior hatch
if he's passed out.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.603
And if he doesn't
open the hatch...
He doesn't get the oxygen.

26:45.605 --> 26:46.770
And if he doesn't get
the oxygen...

26:46.772 --> 26:47.771
Then Walter dies.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.273
Walter!

26:49.275 --> 26:50.941
Walter, wake the hell up!

26:50.943 --> 26:52.109
Wait, what's going on?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.711
He's unconscious!
Let him hear your voice.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.057
Walter!

26:55.058 --> 26:56.402
Walter, it's me.
Remember, you promised

26:56.403 --> 26:57.747
to come back
to the garage with me!

26:57.750 --> 26:59.116
Walter!
It's no use.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.618
He's out.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.793
Cabe:
<i>All right,</i>

27:09.795 --> 27:10.978
so if he's out cold,

27:10.979 --> 27:12.162
how we gonna get the oxygen
to him?

27:12.164 --> 27:13.831
We don't.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.666
But maybe we can get him
to the oxygen.

27:15.668 --> 27:16.900
I don't like
where this is heading.

27:16.902 --> 27:18.352
And where is this heading?

27:18.353 --> 27:19.803
Happy wants me
to use the thrusters

27:19.805 --> 27:21.171
to push the capsule
into the atmosphere,

27:21.173 --> 27:22.840
where he'll be
surrounded by oxygen.

27:22.842 --> 27:25.075
But Walter's in the capsule.
How does he get to the oxygen?

27:25.077 --> 27:26.343
See, that's the part
that I don't like.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.778
We remotely blow the hatch.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.113
The change in pressure
sucks Walter out

27:29.115 --> 27:30.648
into the sky,
where he'll be able to breathe.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.282
We covered this
in medical school.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.251
Falling thousands of feet
without a parachute,

27:34.253 --> 27:35.986
it's bad for your health.
I'll catch him.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.155
Mm, I don't think they make
baseball gloves that big.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.190
No, on a seal mission,
we once did a halo jump.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.358
One of our guys passed out.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.177
He had a bad mix of stuff
in his tank.

27:43.178 --> 27:44.995
I dove after him, I caught him,
i pulled his chute.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.364
If I could catch him,
i can catch Walter.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.932
Except I am
backing the satellite

27:48.934 --> 27:50.834
into the cargo hold right now,
as we speak.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.469
There is no time for you

27:52.470 --> 27:54.103
to get into a plane and get
all the way up there. Plus,

27:54.106 --> 27:55.339
if I don't push this capsule

27:55.341 --> 27:56.440
into the atmosphere
within the next...

27:56.442 --> 27:57.741
180 seconds.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.743
...180 seconds,
Walter will suffocate!

27:59.745 --> 28:00.811
Cabe:
I can do it!

28:00.813 --> 28:02.179
I had jump training
in the corps,

28:02.181 --> 28:04.314
and this plane is already
chasing after the capsule.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.133
It's the only hope he's got.

28:06.134 --> 28:07.951
Elia, you got to have
emergency chutes on this rig.

28:07.953 --> 28:09.286
Back closet, on the top.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.287
All right.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.689
Timing has to be perfect.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.074
Sly?
Do you have any idea

28:13.075 --> 28:14.458
how many variables
need to be computed

28:14.460 --> 28:16.427
in order to make cabe
and Walter intersect?

28:16.429 --> 28:18.228
No! But you do.
So figure it out!

28:18.964 --> 28:20.798
(Muttering):
Okay...

28:20.800 --> 28:22.299
Last time you did this?

28:22.301 --> 28:23.367
30 years ago.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.135
Wow. I'm not even 30.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.937
Shut up.
Sylvester: Okay, cabe,

28:26.939 --> 28:28.972
I just got your speed
and coordinates from your pilot.

28:28.974 --> 28:31.341
Walter's capsule is plummeting
through the atmosphere,

28:31.343 --> 28:32.810
so we got to do this now.

28:32.812 --> 28:33.977
How much do you weigh?
200 pounds?

28:33.979 --> 28:35.913
207.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.749
I start a program on Monday.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.417
Okay, that will
affect calculations.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.219
All right, cabe,
when I say, "go,"

28:42.221 --> 28:43.253
you need to leap.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.421
Yeah, I got it, kid.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.889
Sylvester:
Walter's capsule is burning

28:45.891 --> 28:47.374
through the thermosphere.

28:47.375 --> 28:48.858
Okay, on my count,
I'm going to tell cabe

28:48.861 --> 28:50.494
to leap out of a
perfectly good plane

28:50.496 --> 28:52.863
and then eject my friend
into the atmosphere

28:52.865 --> 28:54.031
without a parachute.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.099
Don't worry about me, sly!

28:55.101 --> 28:56.300
You just tell me when!

28:56.302 --> 28:57.501
Cabe, now!

29:06.178 --> 29:08.412
Okay, seconds away from
launching Walter, but somebody's

29:08.414 --> 29:10.848
gonna have to push that button
because i-i can't do it.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.750
I'll do it.
Great.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.786
You volunteered for that job
pretty quickly.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.988
(Button clicks, beeps)

29:17.990 --> 29:21.258
All right, genius eject
in three, two, one.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.259
Now.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.327
(Beeps)

29:27.066 --> 29:28.065
Oh, no!

29:28.067 --> 29:29.433
What do you mean, "oh, no"?!

29:29.435 --> 29:30.918
He's out of the capsule.
That's what we wanted.

29:30.919 --> 29:32.402
Despite the power that pulled
him out of the capsule,

29:32.404 --> 29:34.171
he was still able to hang
onto the lever longer

29:34.173 --> 29:35.372
than somebody
should've been able to.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.141
He thought it was my hand.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.809
His subconscious tried
to hang onto you.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.444
Given the speed and distance
of what we're dealing with,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.312
one second can mess up
all of my calculations.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.882
Cabe could miss.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.484
Walter?!

29:47.486 --> 29:48.485
Walter, can you hear me?

29:48.487 --> 29:50.554
Walter!

29:50.556 --> 29:51.922
(Shouts)

29:51.924 --> 29:53.056
Sly, what's happening?!

29:53.058 --> 29:55.058
You are 5.5 miles
above the ocean,

29:55.060 --> 29:58.929
falling at roughly 53 meters
per second without a parachute!

29:58.931 --> 30:01.231
Okay, this is where a plan
would be useful.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.466
Please tell me you have one.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.301
Hold, please.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.303
Wh... uh, sly,
what are you doing?!

30:06.305 --> 30:09.039
He is falling likely to his
death, and cabe might miss

30:09.041 --> 30:11.975
catching him midair in a
one at a one million shot

30:11.977 --> 30:13.410
because he was
hanging onto a lever

30:13.412 --> 30:15.546
that he thought
was imaginary Paige!

30:15.548 --> 30:17.381
Would you like me
to tell him that?!

30:17.383 --> 30:18.949
No, it's best you not say that.

30:18.951 --> 30:19.950
Happy:
Maybe we can fix

30:19.952 --> 30:20.951
cabe's trajectory

30:20.953 --> 30:21.885
by using physics.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.904
Cabe, spread out your arms,

30:23.905 --> 30:26.186
palms out for a second, let wind
resistance slow you down.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.427
Hope that was enough!

30:31.931 --> 30:33.864
Hey, Walter.
It's Sylvester.

30:33.866 --> 30:34.898
Sly, what the hell?!

30:34.900 --> 30:35.966
I'm sorry you're stressed out,

30:35.968 --> 30:37.067
but you got to do me a favor

30:37.069 --> 30:38.068
and look to your right.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.236
(Groans)

30:39.238 --> 30:41.071
You see that little dot
coming in hot?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.873
That is cabe.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.141
When he collides with you,

30:44.142 --> 30:45.408
you need to grab
him and hold tight.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.845
This will be
a violent collision.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.879
It's like snagging a hard spiral

30:48.881 --> 30:49.880
that's thrown your way.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.615
Okay, just cradle the football.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.350
Don't fight it, or it will
bounce off your hands.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.952
I never caught a football!

30:54.954 --> 30:57.054
I think I'm wide
on the approach!

30:57.056 --> 30:59.456
Lean in the opposite direction
to counteract the variable.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.459
I'm trying!

31:03.429 --> 31:04.595
I can't seem to...

31:04.597 --> 31:06.330
Walter!

31:06.332 --> 31:07.364
(Groans)

31:07.366 --> 31:08.899
Cabe!

31:09.869 --> 31:11.201
Cabe!

31:11.203 --> 31:12.903
Walter!

31:12.905 --> 31:14.938
I missed him!
Cabe.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.373
Pull your chute.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.642
Guys, please tell me

31:18.644 --> 31:19.943
there's a plan "b."

31:27.987 --> 31:29.253
Okay. Just got
off the horn

31:29.255 --> 31:30.287
with our friend admiral pace.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.805
There is a naval sub

31:31.806 --> 31:33.322
on maneuvers in
the immediate area.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.092
They've been dispatched
to pick up cabe and...

31:35.094 --> 31:36.627
Retrieve Walter.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.161
Retrieve? We're not just
gonna let him fall.

31:38.163 --> 31:40.097
Paige, I didn't mean it
like that. It's just...

31:40.099 --> 31:41.431
It's just that
we're out of options.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.566
We're scorpion.
We're never out of options.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.134
There must've been situations

31:44.136 --> 31:46.069
where people have fallen
without a chute and lived.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.304
Exceedingly rare situations.

31:47.306 --> 31:48.338
I'm looping Walter back in.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.606
We need his brain.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.108
Hey, Walter.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.143
It's the gang, but we don't have
a plan "b" yet.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.128
Well, now's a good time
to think of one!

31:54.129 --> 31:55.112
Happy:
That's why we're searching

31:55.114 --> 31:56.346
for common factors

31:56.348 --> 31:58.348
in parachute fail
survival stories.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.483
I remember a guy in Kansas

31:59.485 --> 32:00.918
hit a plowed field and lived.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.586
I once read a story about a guy
who crash-landed

32:02.588 --> 32:04.121
in the okefenokee swamp.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.389
Paige:
Freshly turned over earth,

32:05.391 --> 32:06.990
swampland...
They hit something soft.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.158
Walter's about to hit water.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.910
Water's soft.
Sylvester:
No, no, no.

32:09.911 --> 32:11.661
The surface tension of water
doesn't allow for compression.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.530
If he hits the water at this
speed, it's like cement.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.531
Walter:
The common factor

32:14.533 --> 32:17.100
is aeration.
I need bubbles.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.169
He's right... swampland
is naturally aerated,

32:19.171 --> 32:21.138
so is tilled soil. We just
need to aerate the water.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.506
I was a platform diver
in high school.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.474
Was there a sport
you didn't play?

32:24.476 --> 32:27.044
In practice, they softened
the water by using a machine

32:27.046 --> 32:28.562
that blew bubbles into the pool.

32:28.563 --> 32:30.079
It helped prevent injuries.
That's a pool.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.049
We're talking about
the pacific ocean.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.350
But Walt will just hit
a small area.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.685
Sly can calculate
the exact coordinates,

32:34.687 --> 32:36.053
then we'll just need
a big explosion

32:36.055 --> 32:38.355
deep underwater
that is perfectly timed.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.290
It'll roil the water,
break the surface tension

32:40.292 --> 32:42.159
and cocoon Walt's body
when he hits.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.994
My odds of survival are low.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.163
Your current odds
of survival are zero.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.564
This is our only shot, buddy.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.533
I'm gonna call admiral
pace at naval command.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.134
I'll tell him we'll have
coordinates and launch orders

32:51.136 --> 32:53.236
for the rescue sub asap.
Launch orders?

32:53.238 --> 32:54.972
I'm gonna detonate a torpedo
right under Walter.

32:54.974 --> 32:55.973
That will provide

32:55.975 --> 32:57.107
happy the explosion

32:57.109 --> 32:58.108
that she's looking for.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.143
(Exclaiming)

33:00.145 --> 33:02.045
Man the torpedoes.
We have direct orders

33:02.047 --> 33:04.214
to fire on
admiral pace's command.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.984
Aye, aye, admiral.
Fire!

33:07.753 --> 33:09.219
My math has the torpedo

33:09.221 --> 33:10.821
detonating in ten seconds.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.422
Toby: Walt, feet together,
toes pointed,

33:12.424 --> 33:14.157
arms at your side, chin tucked,

33:14.159 --> 33:17.127
and try to relax.
Oh, sure, relax. No problem.

33:19.598 --> 33:22.699
Five, four, three,

33:22.701 --> 33:25.335
two, one.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.419
<i>This is xo Calvin</i>
<i>of the USS</i> grandin.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.254
<i>We have retrieved
Walter o'brien.</i>

33:47.259 --> 33:48.675
He is alive.

33:48.676 --> 33:50.092
Repeat: He is alive.
Yes!
(All cheering)

33:50.095 --> 33:52.662
Yes!
(Exhales)

33:52.664 --> 33:55.265
Yeah!
Come on, man!

33:55.267 --> 33:56.366
Come on!

33:56.368 --> 33:57.534
Aah!
Scorpion!

33:57.536 --> 34:00.103
Both: Scorpion!

34:05.611 --> 34:07.244
Hey.
Hey.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.478
You should be resting.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.114
Well, I've been
resting for five days.

34:11.116 --> 34:12.349
I'm going stir crazy.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.383
Well, too bad.
Now take your pill.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.451
I don't like methylprednisolone.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.353
Uh, it makes me jumpy.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.789
Toby says it keeps inflammation
down around your l4.

34:18.791 --> 34:21.324
L5.
Whatever. Take it.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.398
So...

34:28.400 --> 34:30.467
How's your head?

34:31.570 --> 34:34.504
It's better.
No more headaches.

34:34.506 --> 34:38.141
And, um... the memory loss?

34:38.143 --> 34:40.177
Um, well...

34:40.179 --> 34:41.645
I remember the fall,

34:41.647 --> 34:44.714
the torpedo explosion.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.284
Um... nothing after that

34:47.286 --> 34:49.152
except for waking up
at the hospital.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.821
I meant, uh, up in the capsule.

34:50.823 --> 34:53.090
No memory at all of that,
of what you were

34:53.092 --> 34:54.624
thinking or experiencing?

34:54.626 --> 34:56.259
No, nothing.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.195
But that makes sense,
considering the O2 levels.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.863
Toby (Clears throat):
Sorry to interrupt,

34:59.865 --> 35:02.232
but you got a visitor, boss.
Mr. elia.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.267
He's resting.
Nonsense.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.770
If I don't move around,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.507
Uh, what were you guys
talking about?

35:10.509 --> 35:11.708
Nothing, just chatting.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.343
Excuse me.
I can help you

35:13.345 --> 35:15.512
downstairs.
He's fine.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.347
Hey.

35:17.349 --> 35:18.648
Yes?

35:18.650 --> 35:20.851
Why are you pressing
to see what he remembers?

35:20.853 --> 35:22.819
Uh, I'm worried about his brain.

35:22.821 --> 35:26.223
It's scorpion's... top asset.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.326
Bullpoop. You want to know if he
remembers confessing his love.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.328
Bullpoop. I want to know
if he's okay.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.497
Paige, you've moved on to Tim.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.765
Walter is trying
to move on from you,

35:35.767 --> 35:38.201
but his subconscious
is struggling with it.

35:38.203 --> 35:40.270
You digging up these memories

35:40.272 --> 35:42.572
and messing around with them
is going to hurt him

35:42.574 --> 35:44.341
worse than when
he hit that water.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.909
Trust me, if he has
any recollection

35:45.911 --> 35:49.379
of what went on in that capsule
buried away, it will surface.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.747
There will be clues.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.582
And that's mucho bad.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.251
'Cause that means
he can't get over you,

35:54.253 --> 35:56.620
which means a big pile of chaos

35:56.622 --> 35:58.622
for all of us.

35:58.624 --> 36:01.324
Especially the guy
that can't process emotion.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.899
Uh, I need to...
Clean these dishes.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.908
(Grunts)

36:17.910 --> 36:19.509
Okay.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.710
Oh, my god.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.646
My doctors treating you okay?

36:22.648 --> 36:24.347
Uh, too well.

36:24.349 --> 36:27.384
They visit twice a day
to give cognitive evaluations.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.686
Only twice? I told them
morning, noon and evening.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.820
You shouldn't feel guilty.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.189
Lightning strikes
are unpredictable.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.741
I do feel guilty.

36:33.742 --> 36:35.292
I've been reviewing
the footage to try and see

36:35.294 --> 36:36.626
what could've been done
to prevent it.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.361
Hm. You find
anything interesting?

36:38.363 --> 36:40.463
Yes.

36:40.465 --> 36:41.932
But not with respect
to the rocket.

36:41.934 --> 36:43.400
Walter, you had a split second

36:43.402 --> 36:44.601
to decide whether you could

36:44.603 --> 36:46.403
get out of the capsule
before it launched

36:46.405 --> 36:48.638
or if your best
chance of survival

36:48.640 --> 36:50.740
was to shut the hatch
and ride it out.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.442
I calculated the odds
and decided

36:52.444 --> 36:53.810
there wasn't time to escape.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.512
Certainly a tough call.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.714
But in the same situation,
i would have tried to get out.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.249
Almost anyone would have.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.418
Well, you don't have a 197 IQ.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.688
But I'm low 150s.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.323
And I have some life experience.

37:06.325 --> 37:08.391
Point is, Walter...

37:08.393 --> 37:10.794
I know you and Paige
had some kind of a thing once.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.596
And I also couldn't
help but notice

37:12.598 --> 37:15.298
that she's gotten close
to your newest team member.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.400
Timothy, yeah.
What I'm trying
to say is

37:17.402 --> 37:21.338
guys who think like you and me...

37:21.340 --> 37:22.939
We avoid what we can't solve,

37:22.941 --> 37:25.976
do almost anything to avoid
it, no matter how drastic.

37:25.978 --> 37:28.745
I've been there,
during my divorce.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.513
Mm.
Walter, guys
like you and me...

37:30.515 --> 37:33.416
We need to find something to
fill our time constructively,

37:33.418 --> 37:36.886
because next time
you try avoidance...

37:38.023 --> 37:39.906
(Sighs)

37:39.907 --> 37:41.790
...we might not be able
to bring you home.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.795
Okay?
Okay.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.430
All right.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.431
Take care, pal.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.867
Okay. You, too.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.477
(Walter grunts)

38:00.479 --> 38:02.345
Hmm. Everyone gone?

38:02.347 --> 38:03.713
Paige is cleaning up,

38:03.715 --> 38:05.615
sly's at some
comic book nerd fest,

38:05.617 --> 38:07.584
happy's at the junkyard,
and I'm busy...

38:07.586 --> 38:09.452
Hunting happy's husband?
Yup.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.721
Still think it's a bad idea.
Still don't care what you think.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.490
Fair enough.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.026
(Grunts)
I am feeling better,

38:16.028 --> 38:18.395
so I'm heading to Emma's
for dessert.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.730
Emma's... isn't that place
famous for baked Alaska?

38:20.732 --> 38:22.432
Yeah, ever since
i woke up in the hospital,

38:22.434 --> 38:23.767
I can't stop thinking
about baked Alaska.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.803
It just keeps rattling
around in my head.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.571
Okay, see you later.

38:32.744 --> 38:34.511
(Door opens)

38:34.513 --> 38:36.079
Bullpoop.
(Door closes)
