10:36.512 --> 10:40.474
TJ Clawson, a swing and a drive

I'm not sure this was such
a good idea, bringing the baby.

11:11.213 --> 11:14.383
Oh, oh, I see.
You get to go out and have fun

11:14.466 --> 11:16.593
while I'm stuck taking care of the baby.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.719
But you got to go...

11:17.803 --> 11:21.306
No. You would've rather brought Fungus
than dragged boring old me and the baby.

"You make 'em try something once,

11:36.071 --> 11:37.447
"or they'll become picky eaters."

-(BABY COOING)
-There. Okay. There you go.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.330
(SQUEAKS)

19:23.413 --> 19:24.623
(EXCLAIMS)

19:24.706 --> 19:25.916
-Shh, shh, oh...
-(BABY WHINES)

19:25.999 --> 19:28.710
-Oh, It's, it's okay. Shh, It's okay.
-(COOING)

19:28.794 --> 19:31.129
Mike, maybe you should sing to her.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.341
What? I am not gonna sing her a song.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.593
-You have a beautiful voice.
-Go on.

19:36.677 --> 19:38.679
-(WHINING)
-No. I'm not go...

19:38.762 --> 19:39.888
CELIA: Googly Bear.

19:39.972 --> 19:40.973
-(WHINING)
-(SHUSHES) Okay.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.141
Okay, okay, okay, I'll do it.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.561
But just for you.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.939
(CHIMING)

19:50.399 --> 19:53.485
(SINGING) I put you back
Back where you came from

19:53.569 --> 19:56.363
I put you back
Back where you belong

19:56.446 --> 19:59.324
I put you back
Back where you came from

19:59.408 --> 20:01.577
And I'm not gonna sing you a song

20:01.660 --> 20:03.370
I don't care about you

20:03.453 --> 20:04.913
Not one single bit

20:04.997 --> 20:07.332
I don't care about you at all

20:07.416 --> 20:10.002
I don't care about you
So don't think I do

20:10.085 --> 20:12.671
And I'm not gonna sing you a song

20:12.754 --> 20:15.674
Your sweet simple smile
Doesn't brighten my day

20:15.757 --> 20:18.135
Your eyes don't reach into my heart

20:18.218 --> 20:20.888
Your wiggly toes don't tickle my nose

20:20.971 --> 20:24.057
And quite frankly you smell like a rose

20:24.141 --> 20:25.350
(CHUCKLES)

20:25.434 --> 20:28.604
(SINGING) I'm putting you back
Back where you came from

20:28.687 --> 20:31.690
And like I told you I won't sing a song

20:31.773 --> 20:35.152
I put you back
Back where you came from

20:35.235 --> 20:37.237
And now it's hard to say...

20:37.321 --> 20:38.322
(SNORING)

20:39.198 --> 20:40.616
(WHISPERS) Good night, Snore.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.494
(SINGING) So long

20:47.497 --> 20:51.126
Oh, Googly Bear, you and Sulley
took such good care of her.

20:51.210 --> 20:54.129
MIKE: Yeah. Maybe me and Sulley will have
a little grubby wubby of our own.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.507
-CELIA: Mike!
-MIKE: I'm just kidding, schmoopsie poo.

20:56.590 --> 20:57.591
(MIKE CHUCKLES)

20:57.716 --> 20:59.718
(SIGHS) That was close.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.846
But we, uh, got through it. Didn't we?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

21:03.347 --> 21:05.557
Like our Origins of Fear class.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.685
But you don't remember me.

21:10.812 --> 21:11.813
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

21:12.314 --> 21:14.191
"You picked the best seat in the house."

21:15.484 --> 21:16.485
What?

21:16.568 --> 21:19.446
When I asked, uh, "Is this seat taken?"

21:19.530 --> 21:22.908
You... You said,
"You picked the best seat in the house.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.285
You remember.

21:25.369 --> 21:30.916
Yeah. You, uh, you even shared
your Hot Snots candy with me. (CHUCKLES)

21:30.999 --> 21:33.460
I remember that because it's,
uh, it's my favorite.

21:34.253 --> 21:36.213
(SIGHS) College buds.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.131
College buds. Yeah.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.466
Hey, but look at us now.

21:39.550 --> 21:40.634
Makin' new memories.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.219
Work buds.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.721
Yeah, work buds. Why not?

21:44.847 --> 21:48.016
(GASPS AND CHUCKLES) Hey. I know
where Duncan hides his Hot Snots.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.811
-Really? Where?
-(CHUCKLES) Under Roto's cage.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.438
-Oh. Oh, that. No.
-I eat it all the time.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.065
-No. That's not candy.
-Yeah.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.483
-It definitely is.
-No. That's...

21:56.567 --> 21:58.944
-We're gonna eat it. Work buds.
-Don't eat them.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.279
(SINGING) Candy, candy, candy...

22:00.362 --> 22:01.738
Val, no.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.825
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:17.045 --> 22:18.046
MIKE: All right.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.340
All you future jokesters
settle down, please.

22:20.424 --> 22:21.633
Settle down.

22:21.717 --> 22:24.803
Now today will be the evaluation
of the laugh potential of this round,

22:24.887 --> 22:27.764
bladder-like item humans
call the hoopie cushion.

22:27.848 --> 22:28.932
-(ALL GASP)
-That's awesome.

22:29.016 --> 22:32.311
As you can see, I have pre-inflated
it according to the instructions

22:32.394 --> 22:36.315
and will now place it
on the chair and await the comedy.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.567
-(CLASS EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)
-Here we go.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.029
Just keep watching.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.656
It's gonna be great. (CHUCKLES)

22:45.991 --> 22:47.284
Here it comes.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.453
Comedy.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.080
(CLICKS TONGUE) Hmm.

22:52.915 --> 22:53.916
(SQUEAKING)

22:53.999 --> 22:55.209
It should be workin' fine.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.628
It says right here in the manual,

22:57.711 --> 23:00.380
"Inflate it to its full
capacity and then..."

23:00.464 --> 23:01.965
(FARTING)

23:08.388 --> 23:09.890
You killed it!

23:09.973 --> 23:11.975
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

25:57.850 --> 25:59.852
