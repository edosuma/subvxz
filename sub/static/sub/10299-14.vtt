01:23.701 --> 01:26.567
Uh, no, thanks, boy.
I'm not hungry.

01:26.601 --> 01:30.633
<i>Feed me,
you big, rumpled shoe salesman.</i>

01:30.667 --> 01:34.200
Yep. Quite a day,
isn't it, boy?

01:34.234 --> 01:36.767
Wife in Wanker County,
visitin' the relatives,

01:36.801 --> 01:39.366
and ol' Dad here waitin'
for his favorite dessert

01:39.400 --> 01:41.233
in the history of the world.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.900
Yep, cherry cheesecake

01:42.934 --> 01:46.233
from the famous
Chuck's Cheese Bowl.

01:46.267 --> 01:48.433
Can you feel
the excitement, boy?

01:48.467 --> 01:51.967
<i>Feed me.</i>

01:52.234 --> 01:53.500
No breakfast for me today.

01:53.534 --> 01:55.133
I want the first taste
in my mouth

01:55.167 --> 01:57.166
to be cherry cheesecake.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.300
<i>Yeah, you wouldn't want
that first taste</i>

01:59.334 --> 02:02.167
<i>to be toothpaste
or anything.</i>

02:03.701 --> 02:05.300
Oh, Bud,
I'm goin' to work.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.433
Listen, uh, there's somethin'
I need you to do,

02:07.467 --> 02:08.966
but I can't think
of what it is.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.199
<i>Feed the dog.</i>

02:10.234 --> 02:11.333
<i>Feed the dog.</i>

02:11.367 --> 02:13.099
<i>Feed the dog.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:15.200
Oh, yeah,
feed the dog.

02:15.234 --> 02:18.533
<i>Yes!</i>

02:18.567 --> 02:20.099
You want some food, boy?

02:20.133 --> 02:21.467
<i>Well, gee,
if you're done</i>

02:21.501 --> 02:24.900
<i>sifting
through your Playboys.</i>

02:26.701 --> 02:29.167
Let's just see
what's in this stuff, huh?

02:30.934 --> 02:33.767
Hm. "Beef byproducts...

02:33.801 --> 02:35.934
"chicken byproducts...

02:35.968 --> 02:39.234
corn meal."

02:46.400 --> 02:48.467
<i>Hey. Hey, stop that!</i>

02:48.501 --> 02:52.233
<i>Oh, he's getting germs
all over it.</i>

02:52.267 --> 02:55.167
<i>Oh, now it's ruined.</i>

02:59.067 --> 03:03.034
Well, you sleep with him,
you might as well eat like him.

03:03.501 --> 03:05.133
I--
I wasn't eating anything.

03:05.167 --> 03:09.201
I-- I just thought I--
I heard something.

03:09.801 --> 03:12.967
Can the malarkey. Share.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.467
<i>Well, would you look
at this?</i>

03:16.501 --> 03:17.567
<i>This is a lot better</i>

03:17.601 --> 03:21.066
<i>than getting gassed
at the pound.</i>

03:21.100 --> 03:22.066
Listen, Kel,

03:22.100 --> 03:23.633
I'm going
to play some soccer.

03:23.667 --> 03:26.567
Oh, uh, Dad told me
to tell you to feed the dog.

03:26.601 --> 03:30.067
<i>Oh, no,
not the girl!</i>

03:34.033 --> 03:37.033
What was
I supposed to do?

03:37.067 --> 03:40.533
<i>I'm dead.</i>

03:40.968 --> 03:42.600
Let's see.

03:42.634 --> 03:43.800
I woke up,

03:43.834 --> 03:45.733
so that's not it.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.767
I showered,
brushed, dressed,

03:48.801 --> 03:52.234
came home...

03:53.501 --> 03:55.099
Well, my job's done.

03:55.133 --> 03:56.567
I guess it's time
to go to the mall.

03:56.601 --> 03:58.700
Bye, boy.

03:58.734 --> 04:00.700
<i>Well, when
the going gets tough,</i>

04:00.734 --> 04:03.633
<i>the tough drink
outta the toilet.</i>

04:08.701 --> 04:10.999
* I was born in the junkyard *

04:11.033 --> 04:13.266
* A child of the streets *

04:13.300 --> 04:15.533
* My dinner
Was cats and garbage *

04:15.567 --> 04:18.200
* And other tasty treats *

04:18.233 --> 04:20.333
* Police chased and caught me *

04:20.367 --> 04:22.500
* I was in the pound alone *

04:22.534 --> 04:24.200
* The Bundys came and got me *

04:24.234 --> 04:27.167
* Didn't even bring a bone *

04:27.501 --> 04:29.700
* I'm hungry out here *

04:30.767 --> 04:33.301
* I ain't talkin' jive *

04:34.968 --> 04:37.767
* I'll eat anything *

04:37.801 --> 04:41.001
* Even if it's alive *

04:43.534 --> 04:45.834
* Don't want no fax machine *

04:45.868 --> 04:48.166
* Got no use for phones *

04:48.200 --> 04:50.366
* Don't even want
My belly rubbed *

04:50.400 --> 04:53.967
* Just give me
A blood-stained bone *

04:54.567 --> 04:56.767
* I'm starvin' out here, mama *

04:58.267 --> 05:01.334
* Got no food to call my own *

05:03.667 --> 05:07.300
* You better watch
Your wives and children *

05:07.334 --> 05:10.468
* I'm out here prowlin'
For a bone *

05:17.334 --> 05:19.200
Hey, the little tramp.

05:19.234 --> 05:21.966
Hey, I bet
you're hungry.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.767
<i>No, I just like
kissin' foreign butt.</i>

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
How about
some meatball, yes?

05:29.234 --> 05:30.567
<i>Meatballs?</i>

05:30.601 --> 05:33.368
<i>Meatballs would
be very nice, sir.</i>

05:33.901 --> 05:35.834
Do not feed the dog.

05:35.868 --> 05:38.133
It's the boss. Shh.

05:38.167 --> 05:42.099
I'm trying to run
Italian restaurant here.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.067
That's tomorrow's special.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.533
<i>Oh, well,
there's always</i>

05:51.567 --> 05:53.233
<i>the soul-food place
up the street</i>

05:53.267 --> 05:55.834
<i>run by Koreans.</i>

05:56.801 --> 05:59.767
<i>Whoa, mama!</i>

06:00.801 --> 06:04.600
<i>Look at the two pair
of legs on this bitch.</i>

06:07.133 --> 06:08.767
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

06:08.801 --> 06:10.567
<i>Did you get the message
I left for you</i>

06:10.601 --> 06:14.167
<i>on the hydrant
down the street?</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:18.500
<i>Oh, God,
not another jerk.</i>

06:18.534 --> 06:19.999
<i>Look,
I have no time.</i>

06:20.033 --> 06:21.934
<i>I'm getting ready
to run into traffic</i>

06:21.968 --> 06:24.099
<i>and kill myself.</i>

06:24.133 --> 06:27.633
<i>Whoa, heavy.</i>

06:27.667 --> 06:30.533
<i>Hey, uh, you wanna give me
a little somethin' first?</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:36.600
<i>You know, that way you can die
with a wag on your tail.</i>

06:38.367 --> 06:41.167
<i>I'd rather live.</i>

06:42.267 --> 06:43.834
<i>Well, aren't you
even gonna ask me</i>

06:43.868 --> 06:45.300
<i>why I'm gonna
kill myself?</i>

06:45.334 --> 06:49.767
<i>Uh, with my luck, I get
the one that wants to talk.</i>

06:49.801 --> 06:51.900
<i>Okay, baby.
What's the problem?</i>

06:51.934 --> 06:54.800
<i>No one loves me.
I have no family.</i>

06:54.834 --> 06:56.800
<i>It's tough
out here on the street.</i>

06:56.834 --> 06:58.200
<i>Uh, yeah, that's too bad.</i>

06:58.234 --> 06:59.966
<i>Hey, listen,</i>

07:00.000 --> 07:02.066
<i>uh, you've got a little piece
of lint on your back.</i>

07:02.100 --> 07:04.366
<i>Want me to get that
for ya? Heh-heh.</i>

07:04.400 --> 07:08.200
<i>I'd rather give it up
to Garfield.</i>

07:08.234 --> 07:10.900
<i>Oh, baby, look, uh,
I know what you're thinkin',</i>

07:10.934 --> 07:12.767
<i>uh, but I'm no street trash.</i>

07:12.801 --> 07:14.166
<i>I got me a crib
in the 'burbs,</i>

07:14.200 --> 07:15.733
<i>you know?</i>

07:15.767 --> 07:16.934
<i>Two bathrooms:</i>

07:16.968 --> 07:19.934
<i>one in the front yard,
one in the back.</i>

07:19.968 --> 07:21.066
<i>Come on, check it out.</i>

07:21.100 --> 07:22.700
<i>Hm, well...</i>

07:22.734 --> 07:23.767
<i>All right.</i>

07:23.801 --> 07:27.366
<i>But keep it
holstered, okay?</i>

07:27.400 --> 07:29.633
<i>Hey, you got it, baby.</i>

07:32.334 --> 07:33.767
<i>Mmm.</i>

07:33.801 --> 07:36.934
<i>Must be jelly 'cause jam
don't shake like that.</i>

07:40.167 --> 07:41.900
Daddy, aren't you gonna eat
your burger?

07:41.934 --> 07:43.266
No.

07:43.300 --> 07:47.201
I shall not soil my palate
until my cheesecake has arrived.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.433
Can Dad's life
be so empty

07:49.467 --> 07:52.401
that a piece of cheesecake
is this important?

07:53.033 --> 07:56.401
Is this
your first day here?

08:00.868 --> 08:03.201
It's my cheesecake!

08:06.534 --> 08:08.734
What the hell is this?

08:09.901 --> 08:11.433
Aw, look.

08:11.467 --> 08:13.999
Buck brought home
a little girlfriend.

08:14.033 --> 08:18.434
No more of Dad's shoe
for you, huh, big boy?

08:20.300 --> 08:24.201
<i>No, from now on,
they're both yours.</i>

08:27.400 --> 08:29.366
Aw, isn't she cute?

08:29.400 --> 08:30.966
<i>My, God, the girl reeks</i>

08:31.000 --> 08:34.167
<i>of construction workers
and peroxide.</i>

08:36.900 --> 08:39.799
It's here! It's here!

08:40.467 --> 08:41.433
Well,
we're back.

08:41.467 --> 08:42.567
Yeah,
we got it.

08:42.601 --> 08:44.734
You wouldn't
believe the trouble--

08:49.300 --> 08:51.233
Do you know
what hell we went through

08:51.267 --> 08:53.066
to get you that cheesecake?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.333
We had to cut
our honeymoon short

08:55.367 --> 08:57.133
so that we could make
a two-day trek

08:57.167 --> 09:00.767
through the dark side
of Wisconsin's cheese country.

09:00.801 --> 09:04.733
Livin' off cheese wine,
nibblin' on cheese bread,

09:04.767 --> 09:08.500
havin' to make
cheap cheese love.

09:08.534 --> 09:10.900
And we almost got lost
a thousand times.

09:10.934 --> 09:13.700
Well, that's why I sent Peg
with you as a guide.

09:13.734 --> 09:17.133
Yeah, thanks so much for sending
you wife on our honeymoon.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.633
Without her playing pinochle
with us every night,

09:19.667 --> 09:21.366
we don't know
what we would have done.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.767
Well, she's been beggin'

09:22.801 --> 09:24.366
for a second honeymoon
for years,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.834
so I figured,
better you than me.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.834
Kids...

09:31.834 --> 09:33.834
...here we go.

09:34.467 --> 09:36.166
Yeow! Ugh.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.266
Jeez, there must be
a dead man in there.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.633
Ah, boy, you know there's
no mistakin' real cheese.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.900
And, you know, pumpkin,
they age this cheese six months.

09:44.934 --> 09:46.400
Where,
in the belly of a bear?

09:46.434 --> 09:47.967
Ugh.

09:48.534 --> 09:50.034
Let's do it.

09:55.801 --> 09:59.533
I'm going in.

10:10.267 --> 10:11.934
This is a horrible hoax!

10:11.968 --> 10:14.834
This isn't an authentic Chuck's
Cheese Bowl cherry cheesecake!

10:14.868 --> 10:16.433
You went
to the wrong place!

10:16.467 --> 10:19.066
I don't think there are
a lot of Chuck's Cheese Bowls

10:19.100 --> 10:21.233
in Tanoose, Wisconsin.

10:21.267 --> 10:25.400
Just a belch and a holler
from Wanker County.

10:25.434 --> 10:27.066
Where we met
so many nice people

10:27.100 --> 10:31.700
who said wise things like,
"I gots my own teeth."

10:31.734 --> 10:33.467
Yeah, and, uh,

10:33.501 --> 10:37.267
"I'll trade you my sister
for your Bic lighter."

10:39.467 --> 10:41.099
Ah, yes, we had
such a great time.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.500
We must show you
the slides

10:42.534 --> 10:44.700
of me getting fondled
at the gas station

10:44.734 --> 10:49.167
by something that
was half-man, half-owl.

10:49.601 --> 10:52.900
Dad, they met
Cousin Hooty.

10:57.334 --> 10:58.533
Well, anyway.

10:58.567 --> 11:01.101
We saved the receipt
so you could repay us.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.099
All right, I got the money
out in the car.

11:04.133 --> 11:05.099
Good.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.966
Thirty-four, ninety-five?
Right.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.033
We'll make it a nice even $35
for your trouble.

11:09.067 --> 11:11.700
Okay. Thanks a lot.
That would be good--

11:19.667 --> 11:22.533
Like I'd really pay
for the wrong cheesecake.

11:22.567 --> 11:24.600
Or the right one.

11:24.634 --> 11:27.434
Man, I'm starving to death.
Where's my burger?

11:30.334 --> 11:33.400
<i>Hey, babe, I told you
I'd take care of you.</i>

11:33.434 --> 11:35.266
<i>Now, how about sharin'
some of that burger</i>

11:35.300 --> 11:38.900
<i>with your sugar doggie?</i>

11:38.934 --> 11:41.434
<i>I would,
but he's in Mexico.</i>

11:42.167 --> 11:44.567
Come on, let's go play
with the new dog.

11:44.601 --> 11:45.767
Did anybody
feed Buck?

11:45.801 --> 11:47.301
Who's Buck?

11:51.367 --> 11:54.101
<i>You dirty son of a...</i>

11:57.667 --> 11:58.999
Come here, Buck.

11:59.033 --> 12:01.400
Wrong cheesecake.

12:01.434 --> 12:02.633
All I want out of life

12:02.667 --> 12:04.433
is a rancid piece
of Chuck's Cheese Bowl

12:04.467 --> 12:05.600
famous cherry cheesecake.

12:05.634 --> 12:07.533
Can't even get it.

12:07.567 --> 12:10.233
I'm so depressed.

12:10.267 --> 12:13.134
Why can't my life be
as good as yours, boy?

12:13.367 --> 12:16.368
<i>Ugh, take a shower.</i>

12:20.868 --> 12:22.600
Well, if this
is Chuck's Cheese Bowl,

12:22.634 --> 12:25.099
you should know
what his name is.

12:25.133 --> 12:28.600
He was your chef
for 24 years.

12:28.634 --> 12:32.800
No, I'm not the IRS.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.200
Chitty Chitty Cheese Bang.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.200
In Wisconsin.

12:39.234 --> 12:41.200
Thanks.

12:41.234 --> 12:43.266
I don't care if he was
a war criminal.

12:43.300 --> 12:47.133
You had no right
to let him go.

12:47.167 --> 12:51.233
Well, he made the best cherry
cheesecake in the free world.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.800
Just tell me
where he went.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.600
Hans?

12:56.634 --> 12:58.533
Oh, it's you, Peg.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.166
Yeah, you miss me?
Yeah, who cares?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.200
I'm busy, all right?

13:02.234 --> 13:04.834
Listen,
you French moron!

13:04.868 --> 13:07.266
We saved your cowardly
wine-soaked behinds

13:07.300 --> 13:08.834
in the war!

13:08.868 --> 13:10.066
In all the wars!

13:10.100 --> 13:12.767
Every stinkin' war
you ever been in!

13:12.801 --> 13:15.533
Now you tell me where you're
hidin' Hans before I-- !

13:15.567 --> 13:19.166
Hello?

13:19.200 --> 13:23.066
They really are rude
to Americans!

13:23.100 --> 13:25.567
Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you!

13:25.601 --> 13:29.166
Kelly. Kelly.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.767
I did it. I did it.
I found my cheesecake.

13:31.801 --> 13:33.366
You were doubting me,
but I was right.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.600
There was something wrong
with that cheesecake.

13:35.634 --> 13:38.200
See, it was the right place,
but the wrong chef.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.900
The chef that made
my cherry cheesecake

13:39.934 --> 13:41.400
left Chuck's Cheese Bowl.

13:41.434 --> 13:43.401
Daddy, you're
spitting on me.

13:44.501 --> 13:46.366
You can't me you're not proud
of your old dad.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
'Cause I trailed Hans
all over Europe

13:48.434 --> 13:49.966
till I finally found him
in Germany.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.600
See, he had gone there
to die,

13:51.634 --> 13:53.667
but he promised to ship me
one of his cheesecakes

13:53.701 --> 13:55.667
if I saved it as a testimonial
to his greatness,

13:55.701 --> 13:57.733
and I agreed, but...

13:57.767 --> 13:59.334
I'm really gonna eat it!

14:13.367 --> 14:14.333
Hey, guys.

14:14.367 --> 14:15.333
Watch.

14:15.367 --> 14:16.834
This dog can do tricks.

14:16.868 --> 14:18.400
Sit.

14:18.434 --> 14:20.700
Foot.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.234
Speak.

14:23.701 --> 14:24.700
<i>Hey.</i>

14:24.734 --> 14:25.966
<i>Hey, I can do
all that stuff.</i>

14:26.000 --> 14:28.033
<i>Ask me somethin'.
Go ahead, ask me.</i>

14:28.067 --> 14:29.834
Buck, somersault.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.834
<i>Say what?</i>

14:32.868 --> 14:36.633
<i>Gee, why don't you just
ask me to drive a car?</i>

14:36.667 --> 14:38.233
<i>Hey, you want a paw?
I can do that.</i>

14:38.267 --> 14:40.733
<i>Look. Here.
Here's my paw.</i>

14:40.767 --> 14:42.334
Look how stupid
Buck is.

14:43.601 --> 14:45.467
You know, kids, we, uh,

14:45.501 --> 14:47.667
really can't afford
to keep two dogs.

14:47.701 --> 14:50.400
<i>Gee, I wonder
which one gets to stay.</i>

14:50.434 --> 14:52.867
Aw, she's so pretty.
Aw, isn't she pretty?

14:52.901 --> 14:53.867
<i>Hey,</i>

14:53.901 --> 14:55.600
<i>anybody want a paw?</i>

14:55.634 --> 14:56.700
<i>A paw?</i>

14:56.734 --> 14:59.600
<i>You know, a paw?</i>

15:06.801 --> 15:08.567
Hey, where's
my slipper?

15:08.601 --> 15:10.233
Where's my Game Boy?

15:10.267 --> 15:11.633
I don't know.

15:11.667 --> 15:15.001
I can't find my CD
or my best bra.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.300
There it is.
Buck.

15:30.334 --> 15:33.633
<i>Huh? Huh? What? What, what?</i>

15:33.667 --> 15:34.966
That's my slipper.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.133
Bad boy.

15:36.167 --> 15:37.133
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

15:37.167 --> 15:40.266
<i>I was dreaming
about a roast.</i>

15:40.300 --> 15:41.733
<i>Now, somebody set me up.</i>

15:41.767 --> 15:43.633
<i>Who could have done this?</i>

15:48.968 --> 15:51.433
Buck, would you like
to come back in now?

15:51.467 --> 15:53.300
And what have we learned?

15:53.334 --> 15:55.700
<i>Th-th-that when you're
frozen solid,</i>

15:55.734 --> 15:58.468
<i>you really don't think
about sex that much.</i>

16:01.133 --> 16:02.900
Okay,
you can come back in.

16:02.934 --> 16:03.900
Come on.

16:03.934 --> 16:05.700
Come.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.366
Are you hungry, boy?

16:07.400 --> 16:11.200
<i>Yeah, it's a holdover
from a couple days ago.</i>

16:11.234 --> 16:13.600
I'll get you
some food.

16:16.767 --> 16:20.800
<i>Is it possible
God's a cat?</i>

16:20.834 --> 16:25.234
<i>Cherry cheesecake
for Herr Bundy.</i>

16:26.167 --> 16:30.001
Well, I'm a Bundy,
and I'm here.

16:30.801 --> 16:32.333
I'm--
A little bit of French humor.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.567
I'll take it.
Yeah.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.300
Uh, I'm Hans the chef.

16:35.334 --> 16:37.533
I wanted
to deliver this myself

16:37.567 --> 16:38.999
so I might
meet the man

16:39.033 --> 16:41.900
who loved
my cheesecake so much.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.200
I'm sorry,
but you missed him.

16:43.234 --> 16:44.700
He would've loved
to have meet you.

16:44.734 --> 16:46.468
It's very cold out--

16:50.567 --> 16:52.767
Ugh, one of Dad's
socks get free?

16:52.801 --> 16:54.066
Ugh, I wish.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.500
It's Dad's cheesecake.

16:58.801 --> 17:01.033
I had to chase some sissy mary
in short pants

17:01.067 --> 17:03.500
off our front lawn.

17:05.267 --> 17:07.800
He was babblin' at me,
callin' me "Hair."

17:07.834 --> 17:10.200
So I--

17:10.233 --> 17:12.700
I turned the hose on him.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.567
With the wind chill factor,

17:15.601 --> 17:18.767
he shouldn't make it
to the corner.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.532
What's that I smell?

17:21.800 --> 17:23.468
It's here.

17:26.733 --> 17:29.333
I must open it
and let it breathe.

17:29.367 --> 17:31.101
Yikes!
Yikes!

17:32.701 --> 17:35.700
This is what memories
are made of.

17:35.734 --> 17:37.300
I must fetch
my cheese goggles.

17:37.334 --> 17:40.333
Now, you two
may admire it,

17:40.367 --> 17:42.099
but don't touch it.

17:42.133 --> 17:46.633
This cheese means more to me
than both of your lives.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.767
Well, once again,
Dad has gone

17:51.801 --> 17:55.366
where no cartoon character
has dared to go.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
Yeah, but he hasn't been
this happy

17:57.434 --> 18:01.033
since Charmin started coming
in an eight-pack.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.834
Well, we better
get out of here.

18:03.868 --> 18:05.834
Once Dad cuts
into that cheese,

18:05.868 --> 18:08.966
neither of us will be
able to have children.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.767
Aw, I didn't know you
and your pillow

18:10.801 --> 18:13.134
were planning
a family.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.233
Hey.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.500
Hey, look
at that snowman

18:23.534 --> 18:25.834
in front
of the Henderson house.

18:25.868 --> 18:27.166
Looks like
a guy in shorts

18:27.200 --> 18:30.066
givin' our house
the bird.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.667
Wonder
how they did that.

18:32.701 --> 18:35.066
<i>A nice nap.</i>

18:35.100 --> 18:37.266
<i>Gee, that bed
was comfortable.</i>

18:37.300 --> 18:38.533
<i>Hey,
you still here?</i>

18:38.567 --> 18:41.033
<i>Heh, yeah,
but not for long.</i>

18:41.067 --> 18:42.433
<i>The big dumb Bundy
went upstairs</i>

18:42.467 --> 18:43.999
<i>to get my leash.</i>

18:44.033 --> 18:45.733
<i>And I think he's takin' me
to the pound.</i>

18:45.767 --> 18:47.999
<i>Aw, the pound isn't so bad.</i>

18:48.033 --> 18:50.066
<i>Somebody'll take you home.</i>

18:50.100 --> 18:52.333
<i>I hear there's a big demand
for 9-year-old dogs</i>

18:52.367 --> 18:56.368
<i>who couldn't sit
if they had no front legs.</i>

18:56.801 --> 18:58.133
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

18:58.167 --> 18:59.767
<i>It's you they love.</i>

18:59.801 --> 19:01.433
<i>They even got
that cheesecake</i>

19:01.467 --> 19:03.700
<i>over there on the table
for you.</i>

19:03.734 --> 19:05.700
<i>I was hoping you'd
let me have a bite,</i>

19:05.734 --> 19:07.966
<i>sort of a last meal.</i>

19:08.000 --> 19:09.567
<i>Hm, I'll tell you what.</i>

19:09.601 --> 19:11.400
<i>You did me a favor
by bringing me here,</i>

19:11.434 --> 19:13.099
<i>so I guess
I can do you one.</i>

19:13.133 --> 19:14.967
<i>You can watch me eat it.</i>

19:23.467 --> 19:26.301
What do you want,
ya dumb-- ?

19:28.033 --> 19:30.033
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

19:30.067 --> 19:33.700
<i>So now what?
Rub me, wash me, walk me, what?</i>

19:34.601 --> 19:36.867
<i>Daddy?</i>

19:36.901 --> 19:38.834
Well, I've tried
to track down Hans,

19:38.868 --> 19:42.333
but nobody seems to know
where he is.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.433
Jeez, I'm starving.

19:44.467 --> 19:47.200
Nothin' in this house to eat,
not even dog food.

19:47.234 --> 19:48.867
<i>If I had a gun
and a thumb,</i>

19:48.901 --> 19:51.468
<i>you'd be dead.</i>

19:53.801 --> 19:56.233
Oh, tramp. No more.

19:56.267 --> 19:58.733
The boss will be mad.

19:58.767 --> 19:59.934
Okay.

19:59.968 --> 20:03.267
But this is
the last piece.

20:15.334 --> 20:18.099
We have nothing. Go away!

20:18.133 --> 20:21.500
<i>And they keep saying
there's no recession.</i>

20:23.634 --> 20:25.733
<i>Oh, no,
it's you, huh?</i>

20:25.767 --> 20:27.767
<i>Gee, sorry I didn't
get a chance to say goodbye,</i>

20:27.801 --> 20:29.366
<i>but sound doesn't
really travel well</i>

20:29.400 --> 20:31.267
<i>as high up
as you got tossed.</i>

20:34.300 --> 20:35.767
<i>Yeah,
I had it coming.</i>

20:35.801 --> 20:37.500
<i>Well, I'm here
to apologize.</i>

20:37.534 --> 20:39.733
<i>I should have known
you were smarter than me.</i>

20:39.767 --> 20:42.300
<i>After all,
you're a male dog.</i>

20:42.334 --> 20:43.300
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:43.334 --> 20:46.099
<i>You got that right.</i>

20:46.133 --> 20:48.433
<i>You know, I could have done
those tricks too.</i>

20:48.467 --> 20:51.667
<i>I just think
they're...demeaning.</i>

20:51.801 --> 20:53.900
<i>I see that now.</i>

20:53.934 --> 20:55.834
<i>I can't stand
that I hurt you.</i>

20:55.868 --> 20:59.066
<i>The only honorable thing to do
is to end it all.</i>

20:59.100 --> 21:00.834
<i>If you think
of me at all,</i>

21:00.868 --> 21:04.333
<i>know that I loved you
just a little.</i>

21:04.367 --> 21:06.333
Arrivederci,
mon amour.

21:06.367 --> 21:08.500
<i>Ohhh, wait.</i>

21:08.534 --> 21:10.533
<i>Come home with me.
I'll sneak ya in.</i>

21:10.567 --> 21:12.667
<i>I'll find you some food too.</i>

21:12.701 --> 21:15.266
<i>But this time,
as soon as you eat,</i>

21:15.300 --> 21:18.167
<i>I get some heat.</i>

21:20.734 --> 21:22.234
<i>You're the boss.</i>

21:22.868 --> 21:24.567
<i>Damn right.</i>

21:26.400 --> 21:29.334
<i>I'm the male dog.</i>

21:36.934 --> 21:39.066
* Woman makes you stupid *

21:39.100 --> 21:41.233
* Every man's a hound *

21:41.267 --> 21:43.600
* She say
Her love's an ocean *

21:43.634 --> 21:45.934
* Then she pulls you in
To drown *

21:45.968 --> 21:48.166
* Woman makes you stupid *

21:48.200 --> 21:50.400
* Always playin'
With your head *

21:50.434 --> 21:52.366
* Next time
You'll be smilin' *

21:52.400 --> 21:55.633
* Is the day
You wake up dead *

22:04.167 --> 22:06.366
* Woman makes you stupid *

22:06.400 --> 22:08.700
* When she show
A little tail *

22:08.734 --> 22:10.066
* I don't know why
We need 'em *

22:10.100 --> 22:11.133
* Oh, yeah *

22:11.167 --> 22:13.900
* A coffin needs a nail *

22:40.534 --> 22:42.800
* Woman makes you stupid *

22:42.834 --> 22:44.934
* When she show
A little tail *

22:44.968 --> 22:46.467
* I don't know why
We need 'em *

22:46.501 --> 22:47.500
* Oh, yeah *

22:47.534 --> 22:50.368
* A coffin needs a nail *
