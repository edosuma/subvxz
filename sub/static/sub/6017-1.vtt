00:02.001 --> 00:04.334
How about the seedless
watermelon? What an invention.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.131
Scientists are working on this.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.403
Other scientists devote their lives
to fighting cancer, AIDS.

00:10.577 --> 00:13.205
These guys go,
"No, I'm focusing on melon.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.712
Oh, sure, thousands of people
are dying needlessly...

00:15.882 --> 00:18.646
...but this, that's gotta stop.

00:20.587 --> 00:24.421
You ever try and pick a wet one up
off the floor? It's almost impossible.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.752
I'm devoting my life to that."

00:27.160 --> 00:31.153
So I guess if they can get rid
of the seeds, the rind is going next.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.595
What do we need that for?
They're not gonna stop...

00:33.767 --> 00:35.962
...until they're making
ready-to-eat fruit cups...

00:36.136 --> 00:38.127
...growing right out of the ground.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.010
-So, what's her name?
-Karen.

00:46.179 --> 00:47.476
-She nice?
-Great.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.205
-So you like her?
-I think so.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.847
You don't know?

00:52.018 --> 00:54.316
I can't tell anymore.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.554
-Well, do you feel anything?
-Feel? What's that?

00:59.359 --> 01:02.328
Let me ask you this. When she
comes over, you cleaning up a lot?

01:02.495 --> 01:04.156
-Yeah.
-Straightening up or cleaning?

01:04.330 --> 01:05.661
-Cleaning.
-You do the tub?

01:05.832 --> 01:08.027
-Yeah.
-On your knees, Ajax...

01:08.201 --> 01:10.396
...hands, scrubbing, the whole deal?
-Yeah.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.663
Okay. I think you're in love.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.640
-Tub is love?
-Tub is love.

01:17.944 --> 01:20.174
You got a nice girl
and a clean apartment.

01:20.346 --> 01:21.973
Yep.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.173
Just one little problem.

01:25.151 --> 01:27.176
-Sexual?
-Yeah.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.083
Well...

01:34.194 --> 01:38.893
...I've never really felt confident...

01:39.766 --> 01:42.826
...in one particular aspect.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.439
-Below the equator?
-Yeah.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.039
Nobody does.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.842
You know, nobody knows
what to do.

01:57.016 --> 02:00.213
You just close your eyes,
you hope for the best.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.946
I really think they're happy
if you just make an effort.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.860
I don't know.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.620
Last time I got the tap.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.962
You got the tap?

02:14.267 --> 02:17.759
You're going along,
you think everything's all right...

02:17.937 --> 02:21.270
...and all of a sudden
you get that tap.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.608
It's like, "All right, that's enough.
You're through."

02:26.779 --> 02:28.212
Yeah.

02:28.781 --> 02:31.341
-The tap is tough.
-It's like the manager coming out...

02:31.518 --> 02:34.146
...and asking you for the ball.
-Yeah.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.946
Maybe she wanted to move on
to other business.

02:37.123 --> 02:39.182
No, no, this wasn't moving on.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.990
I got the hook.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.187
I wish I could get a lesson in that.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.589
It's a very complicated area.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.200
You could go crazy trying
to figure that place out.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.161
It's a hazy mystery.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.272
Anyway, I think everything else
is okay...

02:54.908 --> 02:57.172
...unless, of course, she's faking.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.834
-Who's faking?
-Nothing.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.776
-Faking what?
-Nobody's faking.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.709
-Orgasms?
-She's not faking.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.115
-How do you know?
-I know. I can tell.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.348
It's one of my powers.

03:11.991 --> 03:13.424
Why? Did you ever fake?

03:13.760 --> 03:15.227
-Of course.
-Really?

03:15.995 --> 03:18.088
-You've faked?
-On occasion.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.391
-And the guy never knows?
-No.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.535
How can he not know that?

03:22.702 --> 03:25.136
Because I was good.

03:25.905 --> 03:29.568
I guess after that many beers,
he's probably a little groggy anyway.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.938
Well, you didn't know.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.779
What's that?

03:39.452 --> 03:41.477
You didn't know.

03:41.854 --> 03:45.722
-Are you saying..?
-I think I'll have a piece of cake.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.382
-With me?
-Well...

03:47.560 --> 03:49.460
-You faked with me?
-Yeah.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.153
-You faked with me?
-Yes.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.629
-No. You faked it?
-Yes. I faked it.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.462
That whole thing, the whole
production, it was all an act?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.300
Not bad, huh?

03:59.472 --> 04:02.441
What about the breathing, the panting,
the moaning, the screaming?

04:02.609 --> 04:05.237
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.908
I'm stunned. I'm shocked.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.513
How many times did you do this?

04:13.019 --> 04:14.919
-All the time.
-All the time?

04:15.421 --> 04:17.911
I think I'll have
a chocolate malted here.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.249
But I'm so good.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.757
I'm sure you are.

04:22.195 --> 04:25.164
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you.
I just didn't have them back then.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.333
She faked.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.472
-Maybe they've all been faking.
-I'm sure they're not.

04:35.174 --> 04:37.642
Maybe Karen is faking.

04:40.747 --> 04:44.239
-She was probably joking.
-No, no. It was no joke.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.612
-She didn't have any?
-No, none.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.949
-She faked them all?
-Faked them all.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.221
Well, so she faked them. So what?

04:54.394 --> 04:57.522
The woman had an orgasm
under false pretenses.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.188
That's sexual perjury.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.863
You know, I heard her screaming
from my apartment.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.136
She woke me up a few times.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.139
How did she do it?
She's like Meryl Streep, this woman.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.936
And I know how to work
the equipment.

05:11.110 --> 05:12.737
I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.642
I mean, if she'd told me,
maybe I could have done something.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.874
Yeah, I could've helped you out.

05:21.454 --> 05:24.753
-What could you have done?
-I could've given you some pointers.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.984
I know how to press those buttons,
buddy.

05:31.698 --> 05:35.532
Well, I'm feeling very inadequate
about the whole thing. Don't:

05:35.702 --> 05:39.160
I'm supposed to do something with
her later. I don't even wanna see her.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.841
Hello?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.704
Oh, hello, Elaine.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.742
So we having dinner tonight?

05:46.913 --> 05:49.108
I don't know.
I'm not really in the mood.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.681
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

05:50.983 --> 05:53.247
You're not still thinking
about earlier, are you?

05:53.419 --> 05:56.388
What, the grilled cheese?
No, they always burn the toast.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.057
No, the other thing.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.853
Oh, that. Well...

06:02.028 --> 06:05.259
Oh, come on, Jerry. You're making
too much of a big deal about it.

06:05.431 --> 06:08.366
-I guess. So you wanna meet at 7:30?
-<i>Okay.</i>

06:08.534 --> 06:11.697
-All right. Bye.
-All right, see you later. Bye.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.332
Renee, can you
come here a second?

06:14.507 --> 06:16.407
Let me ask you something.

06:16.943 --> 06:20.401
Have you ever, you know...

06:21.347 --> 06:23.747
...faked it?
-Yeah, sometimes.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.646
-Really, like when?
-If we went to a Broadway show...

06:26.819 --> 06:30.448
...if we had really good seats.
-Yeah, well...

06:35.128 --> 06:38.154
You know, if it's enough already,
and I just wanna get some sleep.

06:42.635 --> 06:46.071
-I really don't feel like seeing her.
-You know, I faked it.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.013
-What?
-Yeah.

06:55.181 --> 06:56.671
-You faked it?
-Yeah.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.942
-Why would you do that?
-Well, you know...

06:59.118 --> 07:02.679
...if it's enough already,
and I just wanna get some sleep.

07:06.793 --> 07:09.318
Yeah, but why would you..?

07:14.467 --> 07:17.265
-Bad peach?
-It's terrible!

07:17.637 --> 07:20.333
-Did you get that at Joe's?
-Of course I got it at Joe's.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.474
Surprising.
His fruit's usually the best.

07:22.642 --> 07:25.440
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna return this.

07:25.611 --> 07:30.480
-You're returning used fruit?
-Jerry, this peach is subpar.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.214
-So, what do you want me to do?
-I want restitution.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.256
Restitution? You want restitution?

07:39.425 --> 07:41.620
-Why should I give you restitution?
-It's no good.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.627
-Once I put it out, it ends for me.
-It's still your fruit.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.493
-You gotta stand behind your fruit.
-I stand behind my fruit.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.225
-So?
-Hey, you got a bad peach...

07:49.402 --> 07:52.860
...that's an act of God. He makes
the peaches. I sell the peaches.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.597
You got a problem, you talk to him.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.242
You know, this whole place
is going... downhill.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.470
I could've come in here last week
with a bad plum, but I let it go.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.479
Take your business elsewhere.
I don't want your business.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.480
-Now you don't want my business?
-I don't.

08:05.651 --> 08:09.178
And at this moment, you're banned
from this store. You're banned!

08:09.355 --> 08:11.323
But what am I gonna do for fruit?

08:13.000 --> 08:19.074

08:34.981 --> 08:37.916
You seem like you really enjoyed
your risotto.

08:39.118 --> 08:41.916
You have a very contented air
over there.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.955
You look very contented,
very satisfied.

08:46.225 --> 08:49.217
-Are you satisfied?
-I'm very satisfied.

08:49.395 --> 08:53.525
I'm sure if you weren't satisfied, you
would say something, wouldn't you?

08:53.699 --> 08:56.065
-I probably would.
-Sure.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.396
But then again, I'm an enigma.

09:01.574 --> 09:05.635
Hey, listen, instead of the movie...

09:05.811 --> 09:08.780
...maybe we'll go back and...

09:08.948 --> 09:10.779
...you know...

09:14.387 --> 09:16.218
Maybe.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.050
So...

09:22.228 --> 09:25.391
...you feel okay
about that whole thing...

09:25.565 --> 09:27.055
...what we do in there.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.599
You're generally okay
with everything in there?

09:30.136 --> 09:31.694
Generally.

09:33.372 --> 09:36.273
Do you feel the way you feel
after the risotto?

09:37.944 --> 09:41.072
Well, no. I feel full after the risotto.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.409
Yeah.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.987
Oh, God.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.528
Satisfied?

10:03.703 --> 10:06.934
Hey, you know what? You wanna go
see that new Meryl Streep movie?

10:09.308 --> 10:11.606
-Meryl Streep?
-You don't like her?

10:12.345 --> 10:13.869
She's okay.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.606
God, I love her, Jerry.
She's so authentic.

10:16.782 --> 10:20.377
You believe everything is actually
happening to her. No acting there.

10:20.553 --> 10:24.182
-Yeah. You don't want coffee, do you?
-I really admire actors, you know.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.292
It's just such an incredible skill
to pull that off.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.121
Yeah, yeah. Can we get off of this?

10:30.529 --> 10:33.054
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.924
You're not still thinking
about that, are you?

10:36.102 --> 10:38.570
-No, no.
-Oh, good.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.097
Give me another shot.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.816
-What?
-Another shot. I want another shot.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.646
-You mean..?
-Yes.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.880
-Oh, no. I don't think so.
-Come on.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.321
One shot. I could do it.
I know I could do it.

11:02.595 --> 11:06.031
Jerry, we're friends. We can't do that.
It would ruin our friendship.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.099
Oh, friendship.
Friendship, schmiendship.

11:09.568 --> 11:13.163
-No, that's important to me.
-We won't ruin the friendship.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.330
-Yes, we will.
-Elaine.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.408
No, Jerry, it is out of the question.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.170
You know what sex does
to a friendship. It kills it.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.541
Half-hour. Give me a half-hour.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.148
-No.
-Okay, 15 minutes.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.682
I guarantee you, 15 minutes,
I can make it happen.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.616
No.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.815
You're worried I'll be able to do it,
aren't you?

11:33.392 --> 11:36.418
No, it doesn't matter.
Jerry, I don't care.

11:36.595 --> 11:39.257
No, that's it. That's it.
You like having this over me.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.697
-You don't want me to do it.
-That is so ridiculous.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.335
-Come on, Elaine!
-No.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.869
-Elaine.
-No!

12:11.163 --> 12:13.063
-It's Jerry's fault.
-Jerry?

12:13.232 --> 12:16.759
Jerry and Elaine.
They made me nuts.

12:16.936 --> 12:21.396
Oh, I don't care, George.
Really, it's all right.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.405
So you feel okay?

12:23.576 --> 12:27.535
Well, it's not like after the risotto.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.578
Well, good night.

12:34.019 --> 12:37.614
I still don't understand why we
had to walk out on that movie.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.953
Oh, that Meryl Streep,
she's such a phony baloney.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.361
Good night.
Thanks for a really fabulous evening.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.966
-Oh, what, you're upset?
-Yes, I'm upset. Can't you tell?

12:48.134 --> 12:50.034
No, I can't. Maybe you're faking.

12:51.904 --> 12:54.634
I'm really, really sorry
I told you that.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.275
-I'm sorry too.
-Well, stop being such a baby.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.469
-You're a baby!
-You're a baby!

13:06.952 --> 13:08.442
It's all your fault.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.919
You and Elaine, all that orgasm talk.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.617
She did have an orgasm, she didn't.
Orgasm this, orgasm that.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.318
I got so focused on it.

13:16.495 --> 13:19.760
I started to panic and... I lost it.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.059
I tried everything.
I was talking to him.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.395
"Please wake up. Do something."

13:24.870 --> 13:27.395
They're mysterious little fellows,
aren't they?

13:27.573 --> 13:29.336
I hate him.

13:29.975 --> 13:33.536
You know, it happens to everybody.
Happened to Houdini.

13:33.712 --> 13:36.408
And he could get out of a trunk
with his hands in chains.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.675
But he had a problem with that.

13:38.851 --> 13:42.343
-The miracle is that it ever happens.
-It's like a magic trick.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.388
Sometimes I think it would be easier
to bend a spoon mentally...

13:45.558 --> 13:47.651
...than to make that transformation.

13:49.428 --> 13:50.986
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.596
Listen...

13:53.465 --> 13:56.730
...if I give you money, will you
go out and get me some fruit?

14:01.473 --> 14:04.101
-Why can't you get it?
-Well, I got banned from the store.

14:04.276 --> 14:05.868
I can't go back in there now.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.909
-What happened?
-We had a fight over the peach...

14:10.082 --> 14:11.674
...and Joe doesn't want
my business.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.082
-Hey, is that a joke about Houdini?
-No.

14:15.621 --> 14:19.057
-I told you not to say anything.
-What am I gonna do for fruit?

14:19.225 --> 14:22.092
-You'll have to go to the supermarket.
-The supermarket?

14:22.261 --> 14:25.458
Impossible. They don't have a decent
piece of fruit at the supermarket.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.565
The apples are mealy.
The oranges are dry.

14:27.733 --> 14:30.031
I don't know what's going on
with the papayas.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.639
You gotta go to Joe's.
You gotta get me some fruit.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.968
So, what, am I gonna buy
all your fruit now?

14:37.142 --> 14:41.101
Well, if Houdini couldn't do it,
what chance do I have?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.447
Hello? Oh, hi, Patty.
Thanks for calling me back.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.955
I wanted to ask a question.
When we were going out...

14:53.125 --> 14:55.150
...did you have orgasms?

14:55.527 --> 14:57.995
Okay. Thanks. No, that's it.

14:58.163 --> 15:01.758
Yeah. Okay, bye.
Patty Lawrence had them.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.233
-I'll make you a fruit list, all right?
-Yeah.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.738
Hello, Elaine?
Patty Lawrence had orgasms.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.397
What do you think about that?

15:09.575 --> 15:12.806
And I got calls in to six other women.
I bet they confirm an orgasm too.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.809
So, what do you have
to say now, Elaine?

15:15.514 --> 15:16.947
Hello?

15:21.053 --> 15:24.352
-I feel like I'm doing something wrong.
-All right, now here's the list.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.354
All this? It's too much.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.823
-What do you need five mangoes for?
-I like mangoes.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.692
Avocado? I don't know how
to pick out an avocado.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.661
-Well, they gotta be soft.
-How soft?

15:33.832 --> 15:35.356
But not too soft.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.367
See, better too hard
than too soft.

15:38.537 --> 15:41.506
I'm not going through this
every week. I'll you that right now.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.699
What are these, plums?
What is that?

15:43.876 --> 15:46.276
Yeah. Now, get the ones
that are red on the inside.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.345
How do I know
what they look like inside?

15:48.514 --> 15:50.277
What do they look like
on the outside?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.111
-Oh, and get some plantains.
-Plantains?

15:53.285 --> 15:54.547
-Yes.
-What's a plantain?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.620
It's in the banana family.
It's a delicacy.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.381
You're not getting any plantains.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.861
-Hey, Joe.
-How's it going?

16:09.268 --> 16:12.726
Good. Just getting some fruit
for myself.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.901
Gotta have fruit in the house.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.738
I like it as a snack. Wholesome...

16:19.912 --> 16:22.142
...natural, chock-full of vitamins.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.747
All right, let's see...

16:25.918 --> 16:28.045
Mangoes.

16:28.887 --> 16:32.414
Four plums with red on the inside.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.528
An avocado.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.829
Just right.

16:41.567 --> 16:46.595
And three plantains ought to do it.

16:46.972 --> 16:49.702
-All right, just hold it right there.
-What?

16:49.875 --> 16:51.672
This fruit isn't for you.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.645
-What are you talking about?
-You think I don't know, huh?

16:56.815 --> 17:00.751
Mangoes, plantains, plums with
the red on the inside? That's Kramer.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.049
-I can't buy mangoes and plantains?
-All right, get out.

17:05.758 --> 17:09.558
-You're making a big mistake, Joe.
-I don't want your business either.

17:09.728 --> 17:13.255
-Are you banning me from the store?
-That's exactly what I'm saying.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.798
-I'm banned?
-You're banned.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.070
-All right, where do you want it?
-Put it over there.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.709
Yes.

17:25.911 --> 17:27.776
-This stuff is heavy.
-Oh, great.

17:27.945 --> 17:31.609
What do you got? Look at these.
These mangoes are beautiful.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.649
Oh, those are beautiful.
You did good.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.844
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.888
-All right, I gotta get going.
-What are you doing?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.992
I got a date with Karen.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.185
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

17:43.362 --> 17:46.126
There's nothing happening
down there.

17:46.298 --> 17:49.131
You're thinking about too much,
putting too much emphasis on it.

17:49.301 --> 17:52.202
I knew this was gonna happen
someday. It was inevitable.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.602
I've known it ever since I was
a little kid. I've been waiting for it.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.566
This mango is delicious.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.406
That reminds me. I'm not getting
you guys any more fruit.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.777
That guy was eyeballing me
the whole time. Gave me the creeps.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.809
All right, you owe me 28.60.

18:07.986 --> 18:10.386
Gee, sorry, I don't have any cash.

18:10.689 --> 18:12.987
I only got hundreds.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.122
You see, I... I knew it.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.456
Come on, we're gonna pay you.
Have some mango.

18:18.630 --> 18:22.225
-I don't want any mango.
-Come on, take some. It's good.

18:22.634 --> 18:23.965
Yeah.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.399
It's very good.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.040
Juicy. Ripe.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.634
Boy, this Joe's got
some terrific fruit.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.573
What?

18:35.747 --> 18:38.215
I feel like I got a B12 shot.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.647
-This is like a taste explosion.
-I told you.

18:42.654 --> 18:44.315
What is it?

18:45.724 --> 18:47.624
I think it moved.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.120
Oh, my God. I think it moved.
Here, give me the big piece.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.131
-I'll see you later.
-Hey, George.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.132
I'm back, baby! I'm back!

18:58.670 --> 19:02.037
-Do you want some mango?
-No, thanks.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.802
Well, well. If it isn't the first lady
of the American theater.

19:09.781 --> 19:11.214
What brings you here?

19:11.383 --> 19:14.580
Just gonna return some of your things
that were in my house.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.180
And I've got some things
of yours here.

19:17.356 --> 19:18.880
-I know.
-Well, I'll get them.

19:19.057 --> 19:21.457
-I'm waiting.
-All right then.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.352
-You got my fins?
-Yeah, I got your fins.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.862
-Do you have my poker chips?
-I got your poker chips.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.364
-You got my goggles?
-They're next to the fins.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.993
-You got my cards?
-They're next to the poker chips.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.032
All right.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.978
-Guess that just about does it.
-I guess.

19:44.116 --> 19:48.075
-Okay, well, see you around.
-Yeah, see you.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.724
All right, let's go.
I'll give you half an hour.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.222
-What?
-Come on.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.230
-Are you serious?
-Look, Jerry...

20:02.401 --> 20:05.131
...we have to have sex
to save the friendship.

20:06.805 --> 20:09.797
Sex to save the friendship.

20:12.844 --> 20:16.837
Well, if we have to, we have to.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.684
Oh, George.

20:26.191 --> 20:29.024
Please, it's not necessary.

20:29.194 --> 20:31.389
What's not necessary?

20:31.563 --> 20:34.464
The little extra moan
you threw in there.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.295
Laying it on a bit thick,
don't you think?

20:37.469 --> 20:41.030
-What are you talking about?
-What am I talking about? Come on.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.935
You don't think I bought all that.

20:43.709 --> 20:46.974
-Bought what?
-No, you're very good.

20:47.145 --> 20:49.705
Very good with the moanings
and the gyrations.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.247
You really had me going there
for a minute.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.775
You think I was faking?

20:55.454 --> 20:59.151
Come on. With the,
"Oh, George. Oh, George!"

20:59.324 --> 21:00.916
Come on.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.358
Not that I don't appreciate the effort
that was put into the performance.

21:07.199 --> 21:09.190
I'd like you to leave.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.670
-What?
-I said, I would like you to leave.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.864
-Just get your clothes on and get out.
-But why?

21:16.041 --> 21:18.635
Because I said so!

21:19.544 --> 21:21.478
-I can't find my glasses.
-Well, hurry up.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.775
-Let me look for my glasses.
-Get out.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.683
Get out.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.618
Get out.

21:43.435 --> 21:44.925
It's all George's fault.

21:45.103 --> 21:47.936
All that talk about impotence,
it got to me.

21:48.106 --> 21:50.700
And that orgasm stuff.
Orgasm this and orgasm that.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.707
It's a lot of pressure.

21:52.878 --> 21:54.106
I'm a little hungry.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.543
You wouldn't happen to have
any of that mango left?

22:07.159 --> 22:10.094
The female orgasm,
it's kind of like the Batcave.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.854
Very few people know where it is.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.827
And if you're lucky enough
to see it...

22:13.999 --> 22:16.126
...you probably don't know
how you got there...

22:16.301 --> 22:18.769
...and you can't find your way back
after you leave.

22:20.672 --> 22:25.006
There are two types of female
orgasm, the real and the fake.

22:25.177 --> 22:29.079
And I'll tell you right now,
as a man, we don't know.

22:29.247 --> 22:32.148
We do not know. Because to men,
sex is like a car accident...

22:32.317 --> 22:34.979
...and determining the female orgasm
is like being asked:

22:35.153 --> 22:38.088
"What did you see after the car
went out of control?"

22:38.256 --> 22:40.952
"I heard a lot of screeching sounds.

22:41.126 --> 22:44.254
I remember I was facing
the wrong way at one point.

22:44.429 --> 22:47.193
And in the end,
my body was thrown clear."
