00:16.184 --> 00:20.088
(Projector whirring)

00:20.121 --> 00:24.658
*

00:49.483 --> 00:51.419
(Woman) Please come back.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.456
(Panting)

01:08.736 --> 01:10.738
Okay, okay, okay.

01:18.379 --> 01:21.649
*

01:22.783 --> 01:25.353
(Rustling)

01:25.386 --> 01:27.255
(Panting)

01:27.288 --> 01:29.157
Please, please, please, please.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.695
I'll... I'll do
anything you want.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.732
I won't say anything.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.801
Please.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.378
Just... please.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.749
Please come back!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.286
Please!

02:04.392 --> 02:06.227
I promise.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.829
(Sobs)

02:10.798 --> 02:15.636
(Sfx)

02:15.669 --> 02:26.914
*

02:26.947 --> 02:32.953
(sounds of birds and insects)

02:32.986 --> 02:43.231
*

02:43.231 --> 02:50.604
*

03:08.756 --> 03:11.425
(Janey) Excus...
(Albert) No talking.

03:11.459 --> 03:21.502
*

03:21.502 --> 03:31.512
*

03:38.286 --> 03:39.953
(Unlocks doors)

03:39.987 --> 03:50.230
*

03:50.230 --> 04:00.240
*

04:05.979 --> 04:07.981
(Door opens)

04:15.456 --> 04:17.524
(The Doctor) Janey Andrews.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.428
This is the only conversation
you'll have here.

04:23.030 --> 04:27.468
To respect the process we keep
things as quiet as possible.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.471
Arrested for assault.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.505
(Janey) I didn't do it.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.708
My job is not to
determine guilt.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.878
Judge Prince already
decided that.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.416
My job is to rehabilitate you.

04:42.450 --> 04:47.521
If you fail you will go to
jail. So, if you comply, follow

04:47.555 --> 04:52.826
the rules, embrace the silence,
we won't have a problem.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.864
Now everyone requires a
different amount of time.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.766
The judge said I only
have to stay a month.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.502
A month for some.
For others...

05:04.405 --> 05:08.442
You should be grateful this is
the option you've been given.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.079
Now we're a family-run business.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.416
It's just myself
and my two sons.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.552
We only cater to five
patients at a time.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.454
Our success rate is very high.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.357
The rules are simple.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.026
No talking.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.761
No phones.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.930
No Internet.
No music.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.599
No reading.
No writing.

05:32.099 --> 05:35.002
No eye contact.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.539
No gestures.
No touching.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.874
No sexual misconduct.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.615
We sleep at sunset,
get up at sunrise.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.619
It is imperative that
you stay quiet at night.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.427
(Whispers)

06:04.932 --> 06:08.068
You went through my bag?
You can't do that.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.837
Distractions!

06:09.870 --> 06:12.773
They cloud the mind.
They interfere.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.576
That's all that's
left of my family.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.846
Well, that gives you one more
reason to follow the rules.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.749
You'll get it back
when we're done.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.183
It's an invasion of privacy.

06:23.216 --> 06:28.522
Here you have no privacy.
You have no voice.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.092
No name.
No identity.

06:33.561 --> 06:37.565
It's time to clear your mind
of all that unnecessary noise.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.871
Is that clear?

06:45.639 --> 06:55.583
*

07:24.177 --> 07:25.946
(Girl clears throat)

08:49.196 --> 08:51.031
Are we waiting for dinner?

08:55.135 --> 08:56.904
Are we waiting for dinner?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.270
(Clears throat)

10:12.412 --> 10:14.314
I just...

10:14.347 --> 10:15.348
Shhh.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.361
(Girl) Ha!

11:14.341 --> 11:15.809
(Kicks plate)

11:32.826 --> 11:36.363
(Howling)

12:00.954 --> 12:04.091
(Muffled music)

12:46.834 --> 12:48.301
(snarling)

12:56.576 --> 12:58.511
(Muffled music)

13:03.450 --> 13:05.118
(Music sounds)

13:20.033 --> 13:21.334
(Music stops)

13:21.368 --> 13:24.204
(Creaing and rattling)

13:51.598 --> 13:53.100
(Bang)

13:53.133 --> 14:01.608
*

14:01.641 --> 14:03.610
(Sfx)

14:21.228 --> 14:23.430
(The Doctor)
Close your eyes.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.900
Relax and let go.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.303
You're floating through the air.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.473
Nothing is around you.

14:34.474 --> 14:40.880
Now, as you relax, let
your thoughts disappear.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.318
Let your mind wander.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.121
Relax.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.457
Relax.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.994
(Girl) Psssst...
(The Doctor) Slowly, slowly...

14:55.628 --> 14:59.166
an image comes into your
mind, through the darkness.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.370
An empty theatre.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.139
You're in the front row.

15:07.140 --> 15:11.178
There are soft noises,
comforting noises.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.983
Listen to the soft sounds.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.320
(Pink Stripe) No. Let go of me.
I'm not going with you.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.090
(The Doctor)
The sound will disappear.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.062
10, 9...

16:24.417 --> 16:25.752
(Sfx)

16:48.641 --> 16:50.377
(Sfx)

17:02.522 --> 17:04.057
Don't tell
them I'm in here.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.646
(Struggling and shrieking)

17:31.751 --> 17:33.386
No!

17:33.420 --> 17:34.754
Nooo!!

17:36.723 --> 17:39.126
Don't put me in there.
Don't put me in there. Please.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.129
Please I'll do anything.
Please. No. No.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.316
(Muffled music)

18:28.208 --> 18:29.742
(Growl)

18:46.859 --> 18:49.629
*

18:49.662 --> 18:51.831
(Growl)

18:59.839 --> 19:00.873
(Paul) Now.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.309
I'm not going with you.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.843
(Growl)

19:05.778 --> 19:07.347
Now.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.500
(sound of film
projector running)

20:10.610 --> 20:12.745
(The Doctor) You're lucky
my son picked you up.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.417
There are things here that
only come out at night,

20:17.450 --> 20:19.519
things you don't
want to encounter.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.855
Besides, we're
miles from anywhere.

20:25.325 --> 20:25.858
(Door closes)

20:28.295 --> 20:30.463
I saw them drag her away.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.465
What do you think happened here?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.502
I...

20:35.535 --> 20:37.504
You?

20:37.537 --> 20:38.705
I don't know.

20:38.738 --> 20:44.477
You have no idea who this girl
is, why she was sent here,

20:44.511 --> 20:47.814
and yet you sit
there and accuse me.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.585
We are turning her into
a respectable person.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.822
One day she'll make a good wife.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.559
We have a two-strike policy.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.961
This is strike one.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.365
Strike two - you go to jail.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.035
Nod if you understand.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.748
Don't disappoint me again.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.554
(Hypnotic voice)
The noises are vanishing.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.591
8,7.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.794
All around you.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.796
Silence.

21:36.829 --> 21:40.367
6, 5.

21:41.434 --> 21:44.303
The quiet is so comforting.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.508
The deep silence.

21:49.742 --> 21:54.614
4, deeper, 3,

21:54.647 --> 21:59.552
2, deeper, 1.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.000
1,2,3.
Open your eyes.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.102
(Whispers) What happened?

24:18.057 --> 24:19.992
(The Doctor) Close your eyes.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.563
Relax and let go.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.133
You're floating through the air.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.736
Nothing is around you.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.839
Again. Again. Again.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.631
(Gagging)

25:14.180 --> 25:16.015
(Gagging)

25:21.754 --> 25:22.989
(Alexis) Come on.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.926
*

25:35.367 --> 25:37.236
Wooo.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.307
I've been dying to
do that for weeks.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.711
You should try it.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.880
(Janey) No.
I'm okay.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.017
So, how did you do it?

25:51.050 --> 25:52.985
Special ingredient in the food.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.889
The older brother likes me.
Let me in the kitchen.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.727
We probably have,
like, 20 minutes.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.262
I'm Alexis.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.265
Janey.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.970
You know I've been
thinking you're a Susan,

26:11.003 --> 26:15.975
or a Julia for the last week.
Janey's not even close.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.611
You got the J right.

26:19.812 --> 26:22.048
Been here for three weeks.

26:23.650 --> 26:27.219
Got to do something to keep
from going insane here.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.896
They're changing us.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.798
Somehow.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.737
One day you're fine,
the next it's like

26:44.771 --> 26:46.305
you're Little Miss Stepford.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.343
Just like the girl
with the pink stripe.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.012
And the others too.

26:54.681 --> 26:57.416
That's pretty much how you last
around here. You have to keep

26:57.449 --> 27:02.121
quiet and keep your head down,
and act like it's working.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.796
She was here just
before you were.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.765
I woke up one morning and she
was gone. That was on her door.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.702
Okay. So she left.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.403
You're not an idiot.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.240
They took them to the
cabin didn't they?

27:21.273 --> 27:22.909
Yeah.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.777
What happens in there?

27:24.811 --> 27:26.345
You tell me.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.314
You were there yesterday.

27:34.821 --> 27:35.922
I don't...

27:37.957 --> 27:39.992
you don't
remember either.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.229
They took you there today.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.002
I... what?

27:56.442 --> 27:58.410
Why haven't we changed?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.013
I don't know.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.015
I don't want to know.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.253
We have to get out of here.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.058
You need to help me.

28:12.091 --> 28:15.227
I haven't seen a phone
around here, but if we...

28:15.261 --> 28:16.428
No.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.399
I tried to leave last
night and it's just one road

28:20.432 --> 28:21.367
miles before we could get any...

28:21.400 --> 28:24.503
If we take the car we
can get out of here.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.006
There's a car parked
outside the office. I saw it.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.440
Well where are the keys.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.376
If I knew that I'd be gone.

28:33.846 --> 28:36.315
I need you on the
lookout tonight.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.187
We should go.

28:43.522 --> 28:46.292
(Janey) We have to be careful
if we're going at night.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.394
They're scared of something.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.998
We outnumber them.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.367
No.
I tried to leave last night.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.004
He was scared of
something, in the woods.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.220
The cabin.

29:14.821 --> 29:15.988
What, now?

29:17.023 --> 29:18.825
When else?

29:30.236 --> 29:40.279
**

29:40.279 --> 29:50.289
**

31:34.160 --> 31:36.028
(Whimpering)

32:13.099 --> 32:14.300
(Door closes)

32:57.476 --> 32:58.977
Janey?

33:00.779 --> 33:02.581
He tucked me in.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.084
Okay, we have to go.
The cabin?

33:05.751 --> 33:07.319
There's nothing in there.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.520
What do you mean nothing?

33:08.554 --> 33:10.522
(Car starts)
The car.

33:11.223 --> 33:14.326
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.330
We'll try again tomorrow.

33:20.666 --> 33:24.503
My ex used to say that.
Tomorrow will be better.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.639
She used to say "we'll
win it tomorrow".

33:28.674 --> 33:30.276
Doesn't do shit about today.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.112
She?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.513
Yeah.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.150
Small town.
You know?

33:38.184 --> 33:40.419
It was... a thing.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.324
My family... well...

33:48.660 --> 33:50.396
I don't exist to them.

33:52.164 --> 33:57.403
I, uh, started an impromptu,

33:57.436 --> 34:01.207
permitless pride parade and
I sat in the middle of the

34:01.240 --> 34:04.510
busiest intersection until
the police took me away.

34:05.344 --> 34:09.481
Yep. And now I'm here to
curb my radical tendencies.

34:10.815 --> 34:13.284
Well, they're right.
Nothing we say matters.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.491
Did you accomplish
anything with your parade?

34:20.692 --> 34:23.195
Or did things just go on
like they always have?

34:24.496 --> 34:28.134
I tried to explain to
them what happened to me...

34:28.167 --> 34:32.838
that he had his
hands on me... that he...

34:36.775 --> 34:39.378
but it didn't
make a difference.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.514
That's why we're here
because no one cares.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.518
Someone must. I mean,
what about your family?

34:51.556 --> 34:53.259
They... died.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.801
The car hit ice.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.473
It was night.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.146
We went over the shoulder.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.315
It was a long way down.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.120
Mom's neck snapped
when we landed.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.461
Dad... he was still alive.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.168
He couldn't say anything.
He was hurt.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.708
His eyes though...

35:46.345 --> 35:48.747
he wasn't scared.
He was smiling.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.420
He didn't want me to panic.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.891
I couldn't get out of my seat.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.594
I was stuck, so I just
started to scream.

36:05.697 --> 36:10.402
I thought if one person
could hear me, somebody.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.543
I could see the headlights
through the window.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.812
All the cars driving above us.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.952
I screamed for hours and hours,

36:28.520 --> 36:31.790
and the entire time he just

36:31.823 --> 36:34.893
looked right into
my eyes and smiled.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.868
He did it for me.

36:46.938 --> 36:50.576
I couldn't do anything to
help him and he just died.

36:51.377 --> 36:53.211
Right there.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.582
He just died.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.489
All that noise for nothing.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.826
But you were still fighting,
and you're still alive.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.631
I mean, that's why we scream,
to let the world know

37:12.664 --> 37:16.702
that we're still here and
that we haven't given up.

37:32.651 --> 37:35.287
(The Doctor) An empty theatre.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.889
You're in the front row.

37:38.890 --> 37:42.561
There are soft noises,
comforting noises.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.364
(Foot steps)

37:46.565 --> 37:47.999
Don't go with him.

37:48.534 --> 37:50.836
You've broken the silence.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.071
I just..she should stay here.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.841
Oh. So you're running things
now? You seem to think that

37:55.874 --> 37:58.710
your words are more
important than everyone elses.

38:03.849 --> 38:05.050
Go to Hell.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.718
What?

38:18.063 --> 38:19.365
Good.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.403
These girls could have
spent a lifetime behind bars,

38:24.436 --> 38:27.038
but now they're going
to serve society and raise

38:27.072 --> 38:29.975
families as nature
intended them to.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.546
But you... I tried.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.650
I did.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.957
But that's two strikes.
I can't do anything with you.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.728
Take her to her room.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.798
She'll be leaving
in the morning.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.743
- Is she asleep?
- Yes.

39:37.776 --> 39:41.613
Get Cabin 9 ready.
You. Take over for your brother.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.815
(Albert)
I'll take care of the cabin.

39:43.849 --> 39:44.983
You'll keep watch.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.019
But that thing out there.
It's been more sensitive lately.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.886
Damn it.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.209
Aaahhh!!
(Drops)

40:48.046 --> 40:49.147
Going now.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.982
Where did he go?

41:13.939 --> 41:15.641
Oh God.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.242
I hope these keys
are easy to find.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.514
Keep an eye out.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.505
Janey.

41:54.212 --> 41:55.581
Alexis.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.778
The Doctor's name is Prince.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.148
Alexis.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.186
It's Doctor Prince.

43:10.255 --> 43:12.223
Doctor Prince and Judge Prince.

43:12.257 --> 43:13.925
They have the same name.
They're brothers.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.668
(Alexis) It's my release form.

43:23.735 --> 43:26.371
It's already been signed.
Both of their signatures.

43:26.404 --> 43:27.939
(Janey) Mine too.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.074
Why are they signed?

43:29.107 --> 43:30.976
They want people to
think we're free.

43:42.854 --> 43:44.389
*

43:44.422 --> 43:46.224
Oh shit.

43:52.430 --> 43:54.666
They're covering their tracks.

43:55.701 --> 43:57.435
That girl who left the note.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.237
She never finished
her treatment.

43:59.270 --> 44:01.172
What day was it
when you came here?

44:01.940 --> 44:03.141
What?

44:03.174 --> 44:04.275
What day?

44:06.878 --> 44:09.214
- October 22nd.
- What year?

44:09.247 --> 44:11.082
What the Hell are you
talking about? This year.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.685
- Which is?
- 2014.

44:18.289 --> 44:19.090
No.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.862
No.

44:25.997 --> 44:28.266
I can't remember any of this.

44:29.901 --> 44:31.737
What are you talking about?

44:31.770 --> 44:34.039
I can't remember... why
I can't I remember this?

44:34.072 --> 44:36.875
(Sobs)

44:38.376 --> 44:40.178
What are you talking
about Alexis?

44:40.211 --> 44:44.149
I came here September 1st, 2012.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.684
*

44:52.924 --> 44:54.692
We need to find the keys.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.195
Come on.
We need to find the keys.

45:06.271 --> 45:08.774
(Keys jingle)
Janey.

45:08.807 --> 45:11.076
(Muted voices)

45:18.316 --> 45:19.350
(Door squeaks open)

45:46.277 --> 45:49.247
So you thought you'd
just drive away did you?

45:49.280 --> 45:51.049
(Chuckles)

45:53.184 --> 45:55.987
You're a very bad
influence, Janey.

46:00.125 --> 46:02.360
I had such hope for you.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.931
You had everything
the others didn't.

46:08.033 --> 46:10.936
I thought you
were the one for me,

46:10.969 --> 46:14.906
but disobedience like
this cannot go unpunished.

46:21.212 --> 46:23.048
(Squeals)

46:23.081 --> 46:25.383
Bring her inside.
We don't want it to hear.

46:29.054 --> 46:30.221
You.

46:31.556 --> 46:33.424
Where's your friend?

46:34.525 --> 46:36.161
Is she here with you?

46:36.194 --> 46:38.096
I thought we weren't
supposed to talk.

46:39.564 --> 46:40.899
(Slap)

46:56.114 --> 46:59.117
When she's out take
her to the cabin.

46:59.150 --> 47:00.886
I'll grab your brother.

47:01.887 --> 47:03.821
Son, this is her last chance.

47:04.956 --> 47:07.025
(Squeals)

47:08.426 --> 47:10.028
(Falls silent)

48:21.632 --> 48:23.434
Please let this work.

48:28.539 --> 48:30.641
We can finally be together.

48:57.402 --> 48:59.204
Did she have any keys on her?

48:59.237 --> 49:00.405
No.

49:01.572 --> 49:05.043
Alright. This is the last time.
If it doesn't work...

49:05.076 --> 49:06.344
I know.

49:07.545 --> 49:09.414
Now find the other girl.

49:30.768 --> 49:33.704
Now I'm going to count
backwards from 10.

49:33.738 --> 49:36.007
(Film projector)

49:37.242 --> 49:41.579
10, 9, 8,

49:41.612 --> 49:46.751
7, 6, 5,

49:46.784 --> 49:52.490
4, 3, 2, 1.

50:46.377 --> 50:47.612
(Snaps fingers)

51:07.332 --> 51:08.433
(Rattles door)

51:10.468 --> 51:11.702
(Rattles door)

51:20.311 --> 51:21.279
(knocks on door)

51:23.314 --> 51:24.749
Hello?

51:29.787 --> 51:31.822
You can't keep me locked
up in here forever.

51:33.624 --> 51:34.759
(Door squeaks)

51:44.869 --> 51:47.772
(The Doctor) Now comes
the unfortunate moment

51:47.805 --> 51:51.609
where I inform you that
you have failed the test.

52:33.718 --> 52:35.320
(Alexis) Two years?

52:35.353 --> 52:37.622
And what... you're just
going to make me disappear?

52:39.424 --> 52:41.192
You're going to have to
try harder than that.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.461
Let go of me.

52:45.596 --> 52:47.265
You want me to be an animal?

52:47.298 --> 52:48.599
Argh!!

52:48.633 --> 52:51.269
An animal would be better.

52:51.302 --> 52:53.304
Animals can be trained.
Women?

52:54.839 --> 52:57.342
Women are trickier.
So hard to find

52:57.375 --> 53:00.545
a good wife these days.
Someone for your sons.

53:01.712 --> 53:05.250
A wife that can be tamed, that
can learn to uphold your values.

53:06.651 --> 53:08.553
So why not create them?

53:08.586 --> 53:11.956
The demand is there, we
just supply the product.

53:11.989 --> 53:16.627
What? We're part of a
matchmaking service?

53:16.661 --> 53:18.296
I'll kill you.

53:18.796 --> 53:20.765
No you won't.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.236
My ex-wife said the same thing.

53:26.003 --> 53:29.374
Right over there after I
caught her cheating on me.

53:30.808 --> 53:34.245
And then something evolution
forgot came out of the woods

53:34.279 --> 53:37.715
and gave me the solution
to all my problems.

53:38.649 --> 53:39.950
What?

53:39.984 --> 53:42.320
I don't know
where it came from,

53:42.353 --> 53:44.522
but it kills for
me when I need it to.

53:45.690 --> 53:47.258
Say goodbye.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.695
He loved you, so much.

53:54.031 --> 53:55.533
We tried.

53:56.601 --> 54:01.739
We really tried, but you
didn't want to be fixed.

54:08.012 --> 54:09.614
Please.

54:47.985 --> 54:49.920
(Rustling)

54:58.363 --> 55:00.731
Are you okay?
Those bastards.

55:00.765 --> 55:02.567
I know. Get me out of here.

55:04.902 --> 55:05.870
It's locked.

55:05.903 --> 55:07.505
Find a rock.

55:11.709 --> 55:13.678
I think I found
something sharp here.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.013
Oh shit.

55:16.046 --> 55:17.114
What the Hell is that?

55:17.147 --> 55:18.616
Hurry up.

55:22.052 --> 55:23.954
(Growl)

55:34.899 --> 55:36.767
- Janey...
- Shhhhhh.

56:10.501 --> 56:11.669
(Growl)

56:14.672 --> 56:16.040
(Rustling)

56:38.496 --> 56:39.897
(Sfx)
(Screams)

56:41.031 --> 56:42.833
Oh Janey!

56:42.867 --> 56:45.069
(Growling, scrunching)

56:55.012 --> 56:57.047
(Growls)

57:04.789 --> 57:06.090
(Puff)

57:08.726 --> 57:10.561
There you are.

57:10.595 --> 57:12.062
You sick fuck.

57:12.096 --> 57:13.898
You chained her to that tree
with that thing out there?

57:13.931 --> 57:15.099
(Punch)

57:16.667 --> 57:19.937
This is why I called you here
in the middle of the night.

57:19.970 --> 57:22.607
These girls suffer from
paranoid delusions.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.509
Is this a delusion?

57:24.542 --> 57:27.945
There's something in the woods
and he tried to feed me to it.

57:27.978 --> 57:30.481
Now listen to yourself.
Something in the woods.

57:30.515 --> 57:32.249
Think of everything
you've been through here.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.118
You know something's off.

57:34.151 --> 57:37.655
These girls have
accepted their treatment.

57:37.688 --> 57:39.590
They're getting better.

57:39.624 --> 57:41.058
How long have they
been here for?

57:41.091 --> 57:43.828
Alexis has been
here for two years.

57:43.861 --> 57:46.196
She doesn't remember any of it.

57:46.230 --> 57:48.866
You told me this
place was bullshit.

57:48.899 --> 57:51.001
(The Doctor) They're just
trying to undermine the good

57:51.035 --> 57:52.670
works that we're doing here.

57:57.908 --> 58:00.878
(Janey) How many of you even
knew her name before I said it?

58:00.911 --> 58:02.012
If you continue to...

58:02.046 --> 58:03.548
I'm Janey.

58:04.882 --> 58:06.250
I'm Sara.

58:07.585 --> 58:09.787
Come here.
Show them you...

58:09.820 --> 58:11.488
Katie.

58:20.565 --> 58:22.700
You would have been so perfect.

58:24.935 --> 58:26.971
(Alexis) You can't
hide in there all night.

58:29.807 --> 58:39.850
* Cello plays

58:39.850 --> 58:54.331
* Cello plays.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.300
(Girl) Something's moving.

59:02.707 --> 59:04.842
We need to stay quiet.

59:04.875 --> 59:11.716
*

59:11.749 --> 59:12.917
(Thwack)

59:14.051 --> 59:15.085
Shut it.

59:18.022 --> 59:19.724
(Scream)

59:19.757 --> 59:21.258
Oh my God.
What is that?

59:21.291 --> 59:23.293
Oh no.
My glasses. Oh no.

59:29.967 --> 59:31.135
(Rattling)

59:32.236 --> 59:34.104
(Scream)

59:35.405 --> 59:36.841
Help me!

59:36.874 --> 59:50.988
*

59:51.021 --> 59:52.857
(Crunching)

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.782
(Scurrying)

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:27.858
*

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:37.868
*

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:45.710
(Scream)

01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:01.358
(Loud noises)

01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:08.198
(Silence)

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.917
(Drips)

01:02:08.192 --> 01:02:09.493
(Clatter)

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:04.915
(Gasp)

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.154
(Alexis) Janey.
Leave her.

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:11.421
(Janey) No.

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.799
I don't know how we're
going to do this.

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.303
Go.

01:03:27.071 --> 01:03:27.972
Go.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:29.874
No.

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:13.918
(Deep panting)

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:17.021
(Puff)

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.392
It's hurt by every sound.

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:24.594
Did it see you?

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:25.562
No.

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:30.434
Shhh.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.536
Could come back.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:36.306
The sound hurt it more
than usual tonight.

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:38.275
10 years.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:41.311
It's never made
a mess like this.

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:43.948
It's protecting something.

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:46.483
One.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.155
Two.

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:54.091
Three.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:57.327
Two missing.

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.630
Well, the others
must have escaped.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:02.066
Get them.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.502
I let them go,
I'll get them back.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:08.005
Fine. Go.

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:12.609
Start cleaning.

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:36.000
Shit.
He's coming.

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.158
(Rock music)

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:40.157
(Whimpering)

01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:53.370
(Loud music)

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.805
(Growling, screaming)

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.414
Do something.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.392
(Scream)

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.644
(Scream)

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:41.518
(Glass hatters)

01:08:42.286 --> 01:08:43.687
What are you doing?

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:46.523
It's busy.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.359
(Tearing)

01:08:58.535 --> 01:09:00.404
It should have never happened.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:02.805
What was that?

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:06.676
Quiet.

01:10:04.801 --> 01:10:07.203
You let him die.

01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:24.554
I've got two more
bitches to put down.

01:10:46.543 --> 01:10:48.678
(Banging)

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:53.283
(Growl)

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:48.004
***

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:52.476
(Soft growl)

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:02.719
(Crack)

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.134
(Door closes)

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.969
(Car doesn't start)

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:23.507
- No.
- Try again. It's okay.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.141
(Car doesn't start)

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.010
No, no, no, no.

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:30.013
Okay. Pop the hood.
Pop the hood.

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.114
Okay.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:42.792
What's the problem?

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:45.629
They disconnected the fuel line.
I'm going to need some pliers.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:51.501
Didn't think a girl would be
smart enough to figure it out.

01:12:52.436 --> 01:12:53.537
No I didn't.

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.871
Alexis!

01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:05.482
(Locks door)

01:13:07.551 --> 01:13:09.152
Alexis, get under!

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:18.995
Get the crowbar.

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:29.606
(Car horn)

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:33.176
(Car horn)

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.683
(Car horn)

01:13:39.716 --> 01:13:41.818
(Agonized sounds)

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:11.214
(Whimpering)

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:34.504
(Janey) Wait.
No. No.

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:42.879
(Whimpering)

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:44.581
We're almost there.

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:47.784
We'll go in here.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:50.086
You need to stay quiet.
Please stay quiet.

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.565
(Crying)

01:15:07.704 --> 01:15:09.939
You have to be quiet.
You have to be quiet.

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:18.014
Look at me.
Look at me.

01:15:19.583 --> 01:15:21.718

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:23.086

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:26.556
Stop, stop, stop.
Please be quiet.

01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:30.193
(Loud bangs)

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:31.961

01:15:39.836 --> 01:15:41.605
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

01:15:44.007 --> 01:15:46.175
(Bangs)

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.282
No. No. No.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:56.085
I'm dying anyways.
Please.

Please.

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:06.830
Do it.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.933
Make sure they know
you're still here.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.068
No.

01:16:14.137 --> 01:16:15.672
No.

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:19.342
*

01:17:49.132 --> 01:17:51.901
(The Doctor)
Looks like we got a rabid one.

01:17:51.935 --> 01:17:53.302
(Albert) I found the crowbar.

01:17:57.907 --> 01:17:59.408

Go to Hell!!

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:11.400
