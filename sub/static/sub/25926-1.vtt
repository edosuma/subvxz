00:20.488 --> 00:23.455
Oh, that is beautiful.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.557
-Perfect.
       -That's the crown.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.925
[Scott] That is the crown.
           Show Mommy.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.794
-Show her.
          -Mommy, look!

00:30.664 --> 00:32.331
Is that me?

00:32.433 --> 00:35.134
-Duh.
       -Yeah, duh, mommy.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.503
[all chuckling]

00:37.605 --> 00:38.937
Well, it's beautiful.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.006
I especially love the red eyes.

00:41.108 --> 00:44.076
[dramatic music]

00:45.346 --> 00:46.278
You wanna hang it on the fridge?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.679
-Uh-huh.
             -Yeah?

00:47.782 --> 00:49.648
-[yelps]
         -[Amy wailing]

00:49.750 --> 00:52.751
I am almost done with this,
 and it is my first day at the--

00:52.853 --> 00:53.952
I didn't make the rules.

00:54.055 --> 00:57.056
[Amy continues wailing]

00:58.692 --> 01:00.325
Fortune favors the bold.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.694
I knew you were gonna
         throw scissors.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.196
I just love you that much.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.398
[Scott clicks tongue]

01:07.568 --> 01:09.268
[Beth] Are you okay?

01:09.370 --> 01:14.039
[Scott] Hey. Hey, sugar, yes.
           Here we go.

01:14.141 --> 01:16.708
Oh, big happy family.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.177
You wanna say hi to Amy?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.511
-Yeah? Come here.
         -She's crying.

01:19.613 --> 01:22.214
-Yeah. She was.
          -[Amy cooing]

01:22.316 --> 01:23.782
[Scott] Come on.
Give her a kiss on the forehead.

01:23.884 --> 01:26.185
[Beth] Dad, wait, wait.
   Can I put her pacifier in?

01:26.287 --> 01:27.319
[Scott] Yeah.
         [Beth] Uh-huh.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.454
[Scott] Yeah, right there.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.788
-[Beth] Okay.
           -[Amy coos]

01:29.890 --> 01:31.490
[Scott] Great going. You got it.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.459
[Beth] Is this right?
       [Scott] Yes. Good.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.127
Give her a little kiss
        on the forehead.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.155
[alarm blaring]

02:04.358 --> 02:06.525
[Mara sighs]

02:06.627 --> 02:10.529
[Amy crying]

02:10.631 --> 02:14.099
Babe we overslept.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.435
[groans, sighs]

02:16.537 --> 02:17.803
[sighs]

02:18.806 --> 02:21.807
[instrumental music]

02:22.977 --> 02:26.812
[sighs]

02:26.914 --> 02:30.115
Looks like it's gonna be toaster
           tots again.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.750
[Scott] Come on,
    you gotta put your pants.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.152
-Come on. Come on.
         -[Beth giggles]

02:33.254 --> 02:35.554
-[Scott] Come on.
         -[Beth groans]

02:35.656 --> 02:37.723
Are you kidding me?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.158
Can you please take her?

02:39.260 --> 02:45.264
[Amy coos]

02:45.366 --> 02:46.798
[sighs]

02:50.237 --> 02:51.603
[Scott] Good job. Good job.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.205
Here. Eat your food, all right?

02:53.307 --> 02:54.373
Right.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.278
Mommy, where's Rachel?

02:59.380 --> 03:01.647
Now that is an excellent
            question.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.816
Did you not see the text?

03:04.919 --> 03:06.618
She's running late.
  Said she had a family thing.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.289
Oh, that will explain why this
 morning's been such a disaster.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.991
I'm glad you're text buddies
with our young, beautiful nanny.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.359
Don't worry,
        I don't send her

03:14.461 --> 03:16.862
nearly as many winky faces
        I send you, hon.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.732
Keep eating.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.236
Oh, we forgot to open the gate
 again for the pool guys. Again.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.904
That is the third week in a row.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.241
[sighs] Well, at least
  no one can see it back there.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.010
It's green and slimy!

03:32.112 --> 03:34.913
I know, sweetie.
    We'll remember next week.

03:35.916 --> 03:36.982
Yeah.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.985
Are you done?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.019
Yes.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.821
-Are you ready?
              -Yes.

03:42.923 --> 03:43.956
[Mara] Where's your backpack?

03:44.058 --> 03:45.691
-I left it in Kid Cave.
              -Huh!

03:45.793 --> 03:47.426
We better go get it.
     We don't wanna be late.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.594
Hm.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.663
I'm still waiting
    for my invitation to see

03:51.765 --> 03:53.165
the famous Kid's Cave
           by the way.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.033
Well, You know the rules.
       No adults allowed.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.869
So why does mommy
        get a free pass?

03:57.972 --> 03:59.371
Well, obviously,
      it's because we have

03:59.473 --> 04:01.106
such a strong mother-daughter
          relationship.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.708
[chuckles] Okay, that's it.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.142
Plus, she needed someone
         to decorate it.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.611
-[Scott chuckles]
         -[phone beeps]

04:07.281 --> 04:09.047
-Oh, no.
         -What's wrong?

04:09.149 --> 04:12.484
Eric just texted asking
   if I saw an email he sent.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.686
Oh, God, our Wi-Fi
         is down again!

04:14.788 --> 04:15.721
My meeting this morning
          got moved up.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.022
Do you have time to take Beth?

04:17.124 --> 04:18.824
I can't.
 I'm sorry, I'm showing a house

04:18.926 --> 04:20.291
on the opposite side of town,
         so, I'm sorry.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.627
As soon as Rachel gets here,
         I gotta leave.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.328
Mm-hm.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.164
Take out the garbage can
 before the trash guy gets here?

04:26.267 --> 04:27.699
I would love nothing more.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.001
Hm.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.536
Beth? Honey, time to go!

04:34.708 --> 04:35.874
Beth?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.946
Beth?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.415
Coming.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.720
[Mara] All right.
         Come on, honey.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.559
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.396
Raise your arm. Put this on.
      Pew! One arm. Ready?

04:57.498 --> 04:59.364
Pow! Two arms.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.333
This is for you.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.536
Keys. And you don't need it,
    but good luck. All right?

05:04.638 --> 05:05.904
-You're gonna do great.
           -Thank you.

05:06.006 --> 05:06.938
-You're welcome.
        -See you tonight.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.006
Yes.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.675
And have Rachel fix the Wi-Fi.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.009
-I can do it.
              -Hm.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.778
I know you can
     but she's a millennial,

05:12.880 --> 05:14.012
and she'll do it so much faster.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.914
I can do it. Bye.

05:16.784 --> 05:17.949
[car beeps]

05:26.260 --> 05:27.993
[Beth] Okay.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.467
[footsteps approaching]

05:36.503 --> 05:37.903
-Need some help?
            -[sighs]

05:38.005 --> 05:39.571
You have no idea.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.540
-Can you strap in Beth?
          -I'd love to.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.774
Thank you.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.643
Huh!

05:44.745 --> 05:45.777
Hi there, angel!

05:45.879 --> 05:47.579
[Beth] Rachel!

05:47.681 --> 05:48.780
Oh, you're so cute.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.115
Let me take this off

05:50.217 --> 05:52.184
so I can strap you in.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.722
Ooh. Rough morning, huh?

05:56.824 --> 05:58.423
[Mara] Oh, just the world
         falling apart.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.459
I had a presentation
      that got rescheduled

06:00.561 --> 06:02.828
and now I'm late.
  Not a good first impression.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.964
Oh, if you'd like,
  I can take Beth to preschool.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.066
-[Beth] Yay!
             - Yay.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.735
Wish you could,
  but Scott has to show a house

06:09.837 --> 06:10.769
he needs you to watch Amy.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.771
Oh. Of course.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.173
In that case, I'll see you
       later today, okay?

06:15.275 --> 06:16.908
[Beth] Bye.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.310
Thanks, Rachel!

06:18.412 --> 06:19.811
[engine starts]

06:21.949 --> 06:23.048
Bye!

06:24.351 --> 06:27.352
[dramatic music]

06:46.640 --> 06:47.839
-How may I help you?
              -Hi.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.808
Mara Franklin,
    here to see Eric Messer.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.943
It's okay, Clair.
     I can, I can take her.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.478
The whole team's gathered.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.513
I had to stall.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.614
This is not good.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.349
Eric, I am so sorry.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.650
I don't know what's happening
       with our internet,

06:58.752 --> 06:59.985
I didn't see the email.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.853
Look, it's, it's LA. Okay?

07:01.955 --> 07:05.891
Ten minutes behind
  is, it's on time. It's fine.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.026
-Thank you.
        -Don't thank me.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.329
Help me convince the rest
 of the team that they want you.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.731
Shouldn't be too hard.

07:12.833 --> 07:13.932
Yeah?

07:15.235 --> 07:16.968
-Come on.
             -Great.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.870
Lead the way.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.542
So, try not to think of me
   as someone who's interested

07:23.644 --> 07:25.644
in changing what you are.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.379
I love <i> InHabit.</i>

07:27.481 --> 07:28.880
I read it every month.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.749
And if you came over
          to my house,

07:30.851 --> 07:33.318
you would probably see that.

07:33.420 --> 07:36.555
The last thing you need
   is to change your content.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.923
But what I can help you with

07:38.025 --> 07:40.759
is making that content
        more accessible.

07:40.861 --> 07:44.062
Now, if you bring me on
  to handle your social media,

07:44.164 --> 07:46.531
I promise
   to help your marketing team

07:46.633 --> 07:49.067
reach an entirely new audience,

07:49.169 --> 07:53.672
and help them see what everyone
  in this room already knows...

07:53.774 --> 07:57.042
that <i> InHabit</i> is the best
 home and lifestyle publication

07:57.144 --> 07:59.644
on the market. Period.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.516
Congratulations.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.984
You earned it.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.354
[Eric] I hope this office
        suits your needs?

08:09.456 --> 08:11.056
Eric, it's perfect.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.958
Thank you.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.961
Seriously.<i> InHabit</i> is my first
       really big client.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.395
I couldn't have landed it
          without you.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.431
Oh, please.
  All I did was open the door.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.932
You did the rest.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.568
Well, thank you for taking
         a chance on me.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.937
-Well, to taking chances.
        -[glasses clink]

08:26.039 --> 08:27.739
I'll drink to that.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.742
Mm. I was just thinking we
  should go out and have dinner

08:30.844 --> 08:32.477
and talk strategy, you know?

08:32.578 --> 08:34.412
Celebrate properly.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.115
Yeah, you know,
     I would love to, but...

08:37.217 --> 08:38.817
Oh, yeah. No, no, I get it.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.952
Two kids. Last-minute plans
       don't really work.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.287
-Mm.
          -[Eric] Yeah.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.755
Maybe tomorrow?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.824
-I'll hold you to it.
             -Okay.

08:47.461 --> 08:50.462
[instrumental music]

09:19.459 --> 09:23.295
[sighs] Babe, I swear
I took it out when I left. Okay?

09:23.397 --> 09:25.096
I don't know how the truck
           missed it.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.566
It's fine. I believe you.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.334
Okay, I admit it.

09:29.436 --> 09:30.602
I am a garbage person

09:30.704 --> 09:32.437
who doesn't take out
         the garbage can

09:32.539 --> 09:34.439
in a timely manner.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.908
It's not about the garbage.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.878
Okay, so what's it about?

09:39.980 --> 09:43.315
I don't know. Everything.

09:43.417 --> 09:49.154
The yard, preschool, that stupid
  coffee pot that never works.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.958
The thousand tiny little things
    that go wrong every day.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.659
Then throw in a baby,
        a four-year-old--

09:54.761 --> 09:56.628
[stammers] I get it.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.064
It's a lot
      but we're getting by.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.466
I had the biggest client meeting
       of my career today,

10:01.568 --> 10:04.469
and had I been any later...

10:04.571 --> 10:06.071
it would have all fallen apart.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.373
And luckily, Eric was there
     to smooth things over.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.308
Yeah. Thank God for Eric.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.914
Even with Rachel helping,

10:16.016 --> 10:18.350
it's like we're always
         treading water.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.652
If we keep trying to hold
 everything together like this,

10:20.754 --> 10:23.488
we're gonna go crazy.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.991
I just feel like
   something needs to change.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.427
[sighs]

10:31.098 --> 10:34.099
[Scott sighs]

10:39.339 --> 10:40.739
You're right.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.908
Things are crazy.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.013
But, honey, we knew what we were
          getting into

10:48.115 --> 10:50.515
when we adopted Beth.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.284
And if we were lucky enough to
have a baby later down the line,

10:53.387 --> 10:55.620
it would be worth
       all the hard work.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.289
And it is.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.760
Okay, the-the things in life
           that matter

11:01.862 --> 11:03.895
aren't supposed to be easy.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.098
Yeah, but they'd at least be
          easier if...

11:10.404 --> 11:12.604
If what?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.939
If what, huh?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.908
If what?

11:17.010 --> 11:17.942
Go ahead, say it. What, what?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.578
If I pulled more weight?

11:20.681 --> 11:23.481
[scoffs] Are we really having
    this conversation again?

11:23.583 --> 11:25.784
Yeah, that's not
        what I'm saying.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.686
I know, you do a lot.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.755
But I feel like
        I'm still the one

11:30.857 --> 11:34.559
who has to remember everything.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.561
I don't want to have to worry
  about something getting done

11:36.663 --> 11:39.064
if I don't remind you to do it.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.871
You're right.

11:48.842 --> 11:49.941
Okay.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.143
[stammers] I'll...

11:52.245 --> 11:53.511
I'll try harder.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.751
Come here.

12:01.455 --> 12:02.520
I'm sorry.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.390
Okay? I love you.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.426
Let's not go to bed angry.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.196
[Amy crying]

12:11.298 --> 12:12.697
[sighs]

12:12.799 --> 12:14.299
And there it is.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.667
I'll go check on Amy.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.802
[Amy crying]

12:21.775 --> 12:24.776
[Amy sobs]

12:27.581 --> 12:28.780
Hey.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.515
Is somebody hungry?

12:30.617 --> 12:32.617
Huh? Okay.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.122
Oh.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.060
[Amy cries]

12:44.030 --> 12:47.031
[dramatic music]

12:53.907 --> 12:55.273
Scott?

12:56.643 --> 12:57.942
Scott?

13:00.514 --> 13:02.313
-Where's Beth?
 -She's sleeping. What's wrong?

13:02.415 --> 13:03.581
I think someone's in the house.

13:03.683 --> 13:04.783
Someone's in the house?

13:05.952 --> 13:08.052
-[Mara gasps]
          -[Amy cries]

13:09.089 --> 13:11.055
Get back. Get back.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.627
What do you want?

13:20.834 --> 13:23.835
[grunting]

13:25.305 --> 13:26.504
[Scott grunts]

13:28.475 --> 13:30.341
[Amy cries]

13:35.115 --> 13:36.447
[Scott] Are you okay? You sure?
       [Mara] Yeah. Mm-hm.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.882
All right.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.484
Go make sure she's okay.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.587
[Amy cries]

13:45.692 --> 13:47.559
[Nolan]
   <i> Nolan, 30 to headquarters.</i>

13:47.661 --> 13:49.427
[Officer Andrews] Aside
 from the window to gain entry,

13:49.529 --> 13:50.595
the rest of the house is clean.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.963
You probably scared them off

13:52.065 --> 13:54.232
before they had a chance
        to take anything.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.201
What if they weren't
        trying to rob us?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.603
What if they were trying to hurt
        us or something?

13:58.705 --> 14:00.071
Well, from what your husband
            told me,

14:00.173 --> 14:01.306
they had the perfect opportunity

14:01.408 --> 14:03.041
to hurt him and didn't take it.

14:03.143 --> 14:07.145
Honestly, this looks like
  a smash-and-grab gone wrong.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.781
There's been a few B&Es in
 the area the past couple weeks,

14:09.883 --> 14:11.449
all nonviolent.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.219
Look, I wouldn't
  worry about them coming back.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.655
But if you wanna discourage this
  from happening in the future,

14:17.757 --> 14:20.291
I'd look into getting
       a security system.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.926
Do they really help?

14:22.028 --> 14:24.395
They do. If you had one
       in the first place,

14:24.497 --> 14:27.265
I doubt your intruder would have
         made it inside.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.801
A little precaution
        goes a long way.

14:31.171 --> 14:34.005
-Thank you. We'll look into it.
             -Good.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.075
Uh, feel free to call if you
   need anything else, Ma'am.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.143
Okay.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.579
-Thank you, Officer.
        -Get that alarm.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.580
Hopefully,
     it won't be necessary.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.515
Yeah. Thank you.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.053
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:51.324 --> 14:54.359
[instrumental music]

14:58.531 --> 15:00.365
[Mara] I just don't think it's
  something we should skimp on.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.033
I don't either. Okay?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.669
I just wanna make sure
 we're paying for what we need.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.372
Trust me, I show houses
         all the time...

15:07.474 --> 15:09.007
I just don't think
      we need a panic room.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.475
Did I say "Panic room?"

15:10.577 --> 15:13.344
I did not say "Panic room."

15:13.446 --> 15:14.379
What do you think
       about this, Rachel?

15:14.481 --> 15:16.681
Yes, Rachel. Please help me.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.883
Oh, I'm with Mara on this one.

15:18.985 --> 15:20.885
You can't put a price
      on a family's safety.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.620
Look, I get it. Okay?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.188
I'm not trying to get
    a bargain basement system

15:24.291 --> 15:26.057
just to save a couple bucks.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.392
I just want something
    that's gonna do its job.

15:27.494 --> 15:28.893
That's it.

15:28.995 --> 15:32.230
You should get what my mom has.
         It's extensive.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.700
But we haven't had a break-in
        since we got it.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.402
-That's the point, isn't it?
            -Exactly.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.370
Just trying to deter people
        from breaking in

15:39.472 --> 15:40.505
not catch them in the act.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.839
Yeah, I-I get it. Me too.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.741
What's the name of the company?

15:43.843 --> 15:45.243
Ooh, I'm not sure.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.478
I need to ask my mom.
    I'll email you about it.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.747
Yeah. Perfect. Okay.
        You ready, kiddo?

15:49.849 --> 15:51.416
-Ready.
             -Okay.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.483
-See you tonight?
             -Yeah.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.218
Okay.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.653
Okay. Say bye to Amy.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.523
Bye, Amy.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.991
Okay. Let's go.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.093
-Thank you as always.
            -You too.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.194
Bye, angel.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.163
[Beth] Bye, Rachel.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.670
I should probably
      finish getting ready.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.172
Don't let me stop you.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.353
[knocking on door]

16:28.455 --> 16:29.821
[Mara] Oh. Hey, Eric.

16:29.923 --> 16:32.724
Hey. I, uh, I heard what
      happened last night.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.726
I just wanted to make sure
         you were okay.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.661
Thank you. Yeah, we're fine.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.330
Just, a little shaken up.

16:39.432 --> 16:43.201
I'm actually caught up
   in a home security spiral.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.671
Spent my whole lunch break
        reading up on it.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.773
-Scott thinks I'm overreacting.
             -No...

16:48.875 --> 16:50.241
Overreacting?

16:50.343 --> 16:53.044
I don't think you can
    when it comes to family.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.414
Uh... Oh, yeah.
   I heard about this company.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.018
They are crazy
  when it comes to automation.

17:00.987 --> 17:01.919
-Really?
             -Yeah.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.121
My sister got one.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.356
Syncs everything in the house.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.924
One push and boom!

17:07.027 --> 17:09.060
Lights, locks, alarms...

17:09.162 --> 17:11.229
All security systems too.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.763
All remotely monitored.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.898
I mean, she has cameras
         in every room,

17:15.001 --> 17:17.234
which I think is kinda nuts,
             but...

17:17.337 --> 17:19.237
I guess it has its appeal.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.304
Does she like it?

17:20.406 --> 17:22.272
Oh, she's crazy about it.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.108
Doesn't know how she lived
           without it.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.281
[phone ringing]

17:34.421 --> 17:35.420
Hey.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.788
Hey.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.456
Can you be home in an hour?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.324
[Scott on phone]
     <i> Uh, yeah. I think so.</i>

17:41.394 --> 17:42.927
Why? What do you have in mind?

17:43.029 --> 17:44.729
You'll see.

17:44.831 --> 17:45.930
Be there soon.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.398
Okay.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.100
Bye. Bye.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.501
[phone beeps]

17:50.603 --> 17:52.136
[sighs]

17:54.707 --> 17:57.708
[dramatic music]

18:14.260 --> 18:16.294
Yeah, so I checked it out
 online. The reviews look great.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.329
-You've nothing to worry about.
              -Hey!

18:18.431 --> 18:19.464
What's goin' on?

18:19.566 --> 18:20.965
Uh, don't be mad.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.600
I might've gotten
       a little impulsive

18:22.702 --> 18:24.435
but I was talking with Rachel
       a bit more about it

18:24.537 --> 18:26.037
and she gave me their number.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.271
It's no big deal.

18:27.373 --> 18:28.706
Uh, Mara.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.842
I thought we were still
       talking about this.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.277
I... I'm gonna go.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.580
Of course. Thank you, Rachel.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.616
Hey, Scott.
     It's just an estimate.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.017
I mean, I called them today
        for some pricing.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.153
And, they told me

18:42.255 --> 18:43.821
that they happen to have someone
          cancel today.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.457
So I figured what's the harm.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.560
-What are those for?
      -I thought we were...

18:51.131 --> 18:52.730
They're for you.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.532
-Thank you.
              -Hi.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.134
Uh, Dan, this is my husband,
             Scott.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.369
-Pleasure to meet you.
            -You too.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.404
So, look, I took a quick look.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.140
I don't think there's gonna be
     any problem installing

19:02.242 --> 19:03.841
the deluxe package for the price
        I've quoted you.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.544
-I'm sorry, the deluxe package?
           -Oh, yeah.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.213
Top of the line. The best in
  security and home automation.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.915
-Huh. Really?
          -[Dan] Yeah.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.352
I'm sorry. Dan, do you mind
       giving us a minute?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.487
Sure. I'll wait by the van.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.228
Hey, I know you think
         this is crazy.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.930
But we can afford this.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.165
Look, I'm okay with you getting

19:27.267 --> 19:28.733
whatever security system
            you want.

19:28.835 --> 19:29.767
All right?

19:29.869 --> 19:31.335
But all this automation stuff--

19:31.437 --> 19:34.172
But we talked about this.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.506
And then we both agreed that

19:35.608 --> 19:37.675
something needs to change,
             right?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.244
Yeah.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.447
I want this.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.484
We need this.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.621
There's nothing wrong with
  getting a little extra help.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.659
I see what you're doing.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.427
Okay. Okay.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.433
Okay.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.703
So what's in the deluxe package?

20:05.805 --> 20:08.606
From a security standpoint,
 it's the best in the business.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.608
All right,
    I'm gonna put one there.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.376
One camera up here.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.912
[Dan] <i> It has an award-winning</i>
     <i> alarm response system.</i>

20:15.014 --> 20:16.547
<i> There are cameras</i>
         <i> in every room,</i>

20:16.649 --> 20:17.882
<i> all with remote access</i>

20:17.984 --> 20:20.585
<i> that connect to an app</i>
         <i> on your phone.</i>

20:20.687 --> 20:23.054
<i> The whole house is wired with</i>
  <i> microphone-enabled speakers,</i>

20:23.156 --> 20:24.155
<i> so you can hear everything</i>
        <i> that's happening</i>

20:24.257 --> 20:25.289
<i> while you're away.</i>

20:25.391 --> 20:26.557

32:15.801 --> 32:17.367
[Scott] My mind didn't change.

32:17.469 --> 32:18.936
This is definitely gonna
        end the same way.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.404
[laughing]

32:20.506 --> 32:23.840
Maybe with a little less
          time travel.

32:23.943 --> 32:27.177
But in the meantime...

32:27.279 --> 32:29.246
let's just enjoy the ride.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.449
I'm already there.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.607
Tonight was good.

32:57.710 --> 32:58.842
[Scott] Yeah.

32:58.944 --> 33:00.043
It was.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.117
[Mara] <i> I know we're still</i>
  <i> getting used to all of this</i>

33:07.219 --> 33:08.885
<i> but...</i>

33:08.988 --> 33:09.987
[camera whirring]

33:10.089 --> 33:11.054
<i> it's nice to feel like things</i>

33:11.156 --> 33:12.856
<i> are more manageable again.</i>

33:12.958 --> 33:14.124
[Scott] <i> Yeah.</i>

33:23.335 --> 33:25.635
-I was thinking...
             -Mm-hm.

33:25.738 --> 33:29.239
[Mara] <i> How do you feel about</i>
  <i> cutting back Rachel's hours?</i>

33:29.341 --> 33:32.009
[Scott] <i> Don't you think</i>
 <i> that's jumping the gun a bit?</i>

33:32.111 --> 33:34.678
[Mara] <i> I'm not saying</i>
         <i> we let her go.</i>

33:34.780 --> 33:36.413
But maybe the days
    you're working from home

33:36.515 --> 33:38.248
we might not need her.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.916
Maybe she can just come in
       a few days a week?

33:40.019 --> 33:42.352
I see what you're trying to do.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.087
You're trying to turn me into
 your househusband, aren't you?

33:44.189 --> 33:45.489
[giggles]

33:45.591 --> 33:47.491
Mm. You'll always be
         my rugged man.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.092
[laughing]

33:49.194 --> 33:50.827
Just, you know.

33:50.929 --> 33:52.496
A rugged man who folds laundry.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.830
Oh.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.535
Sure.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.504
And maybe once you get
      a couple big clients

34:00.606 --> 34:02.839
under your belt, you can
  start working from home, too.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.609
And then we can be domestic
       goddesses together.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.277
[giggles]

34:07.379 --> 34:09.980
That's the dream.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.449
-So, what do you think?
         -About Rachel?

34:13.318 --> 34:14.684
Hm.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.554
I don't know.
  Let's see how the week goes.

34:17.656 --> 34:20.489
Once we get into
   our new groove, who knows?

34:20.592 --> 34:23.592
<i>Maybe we won't need her at all.</i>
             <i> Deal?</i>

34:24.563 --> 34:25.594
Deal.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.422
[keys clacking]

35:30.863 --> 35:32.696
[Amy crying]

35:37.636 --> 35:40.370
Hi. Hi.

35:58.056 --> 35:59.055
Beth?

36:01.026 --> 36:04.027
[intense music]

36:14.740 --> 36:16.740
[indistinct murmuring]

36:23.982 --> 36:27.417
Um, we have to whisper.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.489
[exhales]

36:49.408 --> 36:50.473
Beth?

36:54.379 --> 36:57.113
Beth, honey, what are you doing?

36:57.216 --> 36:59.883
[whispering]
      I was talking to SAM.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.118
You were talking to him?

37:03.755 --> 37:04.988
Why?

37:05.090 --> 37:08.325
I'm not tired.
     I just wanted to play.

37:08.427 --> 37:11.695
Okay, sweetie, you can't
   sneak out of bed like that.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.396
You scared me.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.832
-I'm sorry.
             -Okay.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.734
Hey...

37:17.836 --> 37:20.670
let's get you
      back to sleep, okay?

37:20.772 --> 37:22.739
Okay. Come on.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.342
Ooh.

37:25.444 --> 37:41.524
[SAM beeps] goodnight

37:41.627 --> 37:54.604
[SAM beeps] <i> Alert.</i>
     <i> Laundry load complete.</i>

38:05.517 --> 38:08.351
-[Scott] Mara?
            -In here.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.490
-Mornin'.
            -Morning.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.059
You're up early.

38:16.161 --> 38:18.395
Not as early as you.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.763
Someone's been busy.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.531
Yeah.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.799
I didn't sleep
    all that well last night,

38:22.901 --> 38:25.802
so... figured I'd be productive

38:25.904 --> 38:28.204
instead of tossing in bed.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.073
Well, that sounds awful.

38:30.175 --> 38:31.808
But I can't say I mind.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.743
Don't be too grateful.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.145
You get to fold.

38:35.247 --> 38:36.913
Yay!

38:37.015 --> 38:38.948
I'm gonna go see
        if Beth's awake.

38:39.051 --> 38:40.150
Yeah, take your time.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.184
I still have a whole hour

38:41.286 --> 38:42.652
to kill after this.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.443
-Excuse me, Sarah?
              -Yes.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.913
Hi, I'm Mara.
   You're Rachel's mom, right?

39:10.849 --> 39:12.248
She babysits our kids.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.750
I think we met once,
     when she first started

39:13.852 --> 39:15.418
working for us.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.187
Has she caused any trouble?

39:17.289 --> 39:19.656
I-I know she got sent home
      early the other day.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.958
Oh, no. No. Not at all.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.462
She's been great. We were just
     giving her the day off.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.864
And, honestly, I don't know
    what we'd do without her.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.265
Turns out a baby
     and a four-year-old are

39:29.368 --> 39:31.735
more than we can
      handle by ourselves.

39:34.106 --> 39:36.439
Uh, the security system
          also helped.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.508
I guess I should thank you
         for that, too.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.212
Rachel sent us the company
            you use.

39:42.314 --> 39:44.681
We don't have a security system.

39:44.783 --> 39:47.183
I'm not sure why she would
      make up such a thing.

39:48.754 --> 39:51.688
M-my daughter,
     she, she's a good girl.

39:51.790 --> 39:52.789
Usually.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.291
But she's troubled.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.027
Her father...

39:59.464 --> 40:01.798
I-I'm sorry, I should go.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.833
-Is everything okay?
     -Please, just go home.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.369
[Sarah] W-we shouldn't
           be talking.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.888
[Rachel] What was that about?

40:25.457 --> 40:27.424
What?

40:27.526 --> 40:29.692
I saw you talking to Mara.

40:29.795 --> 40:33.163
Yes, she saw me on the street
   and started talking to me.

40:33.265 --> 40:35.098
I couldn't just ignore her.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.067
-What did you say?
    -I-I didn't say anything.

40:38.170 --> 40:40.303
She just said hi.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.441
You better not be lying to me.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.509
[utensil clatters]

40:47.145 --> 40:48.778
I'm not.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.682
I hope so.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.990
[instrumental music]

41:07.132 --> 41:10.033
God, it was just so bizarre.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.802
The whole thing.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.537
And why would Rachel lie to us?

41:14.639 --> 41:16.306
[sighs] I don't know.

41:17.742 --> 41:20.109
I don't know,
    maybe her mom's mistaken.

41:20.212 --> 41:21.778
I-I have no clue. I...

41:21.880 --> 41:23.880
The whole thing, it's just...

41:23.982 --> 41:26.549
I don't know,
       seems very surreal.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.219
Yeah. I don't know
         what to think.

41:31.389 --> 41:33.456
-Hey.
          -[Mara sighs]

41:33.558 --> 41:35.825
I'll talk to Rachel today,
              okay?

41:35.927 --> 41:37.794
Look, I'm sure it's nothing.

41:37.896 --> 41:41.197
Just a... big misunderstanding
          or something.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.368
Yeah, you're probably right.
             [sighs]

41:46.371 --> 41:48.471
I think I'm just tired.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.242
And now I get to go
         into the office

41:52.344 --> 41:54.711
and tweet about tiny homes.
           [chuckles]

41:56.214 --> 41:57.647
Take your time.

41:57.749 --> 42:01.117
Get ready.
  I'll take care of the girls.

42:01.219 --> 42:04.053
And by the time you get back,
  this will all be cleared up.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.655
Deal?

42:06.358 --> 42:07.857
Okay. Thank you.

42:07.959 --> 42:08.958
You're welcome.

[Rachel] I put her down already.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.653
[Scott] Rachel?

42:40.258 --> 42:41.925
When did you get here?

42:42.027 --> 42:44.327
Thirty minutes ago.

42:44.429 --> 42:46.963
Sorry, I let myself in
  because the door was unlocked

42:47.065 --> 42:48.932
and I didn't
      want to disturb you.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.301
Really? Hm.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.737
Uh, lis...

42:54.839 --> 42:57.240
Do you mind if I talk to you
       in the living room?

42:57.342 --> 43:00.043
Of course. Anything you want.

43:09.921 --> 43:10.920
[Rachel sighs]

43:12.023 --> 43:13.189
So, what's up?

43:15.393 --> 43:16.459
Uh...

43:18.129 --> 43:20.163
So, me and Mara were talking
          this morning

43:20.265 --> 43:21.864
um, about you.

43:21.967 --> 43:25.168
And how much we appreciate
   everything that you've done

43:25.270 --> 43:26.970
here with the, the helping out
          with the kids

43:27.072 --> 43:28.938
and the house and everything.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.507
Trust me, it's been a pleasure.
        I love you guys.

43:31.610 --> 43:34.577
[chuckles] Yes.
   An-an-and we love you too.

43:34.679 --> 43:39.082
Um, it's just... [sighs]

43:41.119 --> 43:42.819
I mean, you probably don't
         plan on working

43:42.921 --> 43:44.554
for us forever, right?

43:44.656 --> 43:46.022
I mean, you're probably
     thinking about college

43:46.124 --> 43:48.725
and, uh, career, moving...

43:48.827 --> 43:50.793
Oh, no. I...

43:50.895 --> 43:52.662
I haven't even applied.

43:52.764 --> 43:54.130
I'm tryin' to save up.

43:54.232 --> 43:56.699
Besides, I would
    never leave you and Mara.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.735
Or the kids.

43:58.837 --> 44:00.503
And I can't leave my mom.

44:00.605 --> 44:02.372
I mean, she doesn't have
          anybody else.

44:02.474 --> 44:06.075
-Who's gonna take care of her?
    -Yeah, so, about that...

44:08.947 --> 44:11.214
Um, I have to be
       straight with you.

44:11.316 --> 44:12.849
Uh...

44:12.951 --> 44:15.151
Mara ran into your mom
          this morning.

44:16.955 --> 44:18.788
And...

44:19.858 --> 44:22.158
she said the conversation, um...

44:22.260 --> 44:25.261
[clicks tongue] It was
        kind of strange.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.231
What do you mean?

44:30.502 --> 44:33.236
Well, apparently
       your mom told Mara

44:33.338 --> 44:37.006
that you guys don't have
       a security system.

44:37.108 --> 44:40.710
And that... I don't know,
            you're...

44:40.812 --> 44:42.478
you're troubled.

44:43.782 --> 44:45.615
Something about your dad.

44:50.689 --> 44:51.621
-I'm sorry.
          -No, no, no!

44:51.723 --> 44:53.423
No, it's, it's okay. All right?

44:53.525 --> 44:55.291
I'm just, uh...

44:55.393 --> 44:56.959
[clears throat]

44:57.062 --> 45:00.196
I'm having a hard time
 understanding why you would...

45:00.298 --> 45:02.765
Why you'd lie to us?

45:02.867 --> 45:06.369
About something... so weird?

45:07.405 --> 45:09.072
No...

45:09.174 --> 45:11.607
I'm sorry that Mara had to
       see her like that.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.510
I didn't lie.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.281
I'm not the troubled one,
             she is.

45:19.551 --> 45:22.218
My dad, he was a bad person.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.888
He... He'd hit her and-and me.

45:25.990 --> 45:27.957
-Uh, Rachel, I, I--
         -N-no, no, no.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.093
It's okay. Just listen.

45:30.195 --> 45:31.461
Okay.

45:31.563 --> 45:34.564
For years, we had to
         put up with it.

45:34.666 --> 45:37.333
We were too scared
         to tell anyone.

45:37.435 --> 45:39.402
He would get drunk,

45:39.504 --> 45:41.904
get angry
     and take it out on us.

45:43.341 --> 45:46.442
And even though
    things got worse, and...

45:46.544 --> 45:48.678
he would continuously hurt us,

45:48.780 --> 45:50.246
she still loved him.

45:52.016 --> 45:54.016
And even when he got drunk

45:54.119 --> 45:57.153
and crashed head on
        into another car,

45:57.255 --> 45:59.322
she defended him.

46:01.726 --> 46:03.993
[sobbing] And when he died...

46:05.330 --> 46:07.730
she just lost it.

46:10.835 --> 46:13.236
She's never been the same since.

46:16.641 --> 46:18.674
She got depressed

46:18.777 --> 46:22.478
and took
    all kinds of medication.

46:22.580 --> 46:26.883
And it's just, it's just like
        her mind's gone.

46:28.586 --> 46:30.686
[Rachel] You know, when...

46:30.789 --> 46:32.955
she's at home, she's okay.

46:33.057 --> 46:35.725
But [scoffs] on bad days...

46:40.165 --> 46:42.131
[sobbing]

46:43.468 --> 46:44.801
Hey.

46:44.903 --> 46:48.004
Oh, come on. that's okay.

46:48.106 --> 46:51.440
-[Rachel sniffles]
     -I'm sorry. It's okay.

46:53.077 --> 46:55.411
-[Rachel sniffles]
    -Every-everything's okay.

46:58.283 --> 47:00.616
Tell you what.
      Why don't you, uh...

47:02.086 --> 47:05.087
Why don't you take
    the rest of the day off?

47:05.190 --> 47:07.089
Okay? Go home
  and, an-and be with your mom.

47:07.192 --> 47:09.158
I can take care
       of everything here.

47:10.862 --> 47:12.461
No, no, no.
   Please, don't send me home.

47:12.564 --> 47:15.665
I wanna stay here with you,
        with the family.

47:19.671 --> 47:21.370
Please.

47:25.276 --> 47:27.543
-What're you doing?
       -I-I'm sorry if I--

47:27.645 --> 47:29.612
Rachel, you need to go home.

47:29.714 --> 47:32.014
-Uh, Scott--
        -Rachel, go home!

47:32.116 --> 47:33.583
[Scott]
           Right now.

47:33.685 --> 47:37.153
You cannot just push me away
       like everyone else.

47:38.022 --> 47:40.456
This is my family too.

47:49.467 --> 47:52.735
-You lied to me.
           -I didn't.

47:52.837 --> 47:55.805
Scott told me what you said.
    Now they don't trust me.

47:55.907 --> 47:57.440
Why are you trying to get
           between us?

47:57.542 --> 47:58.941
I know what you're up to,

47:59.043 --> 48:00.409
why you're always there
           with them.

48:00.511 --> 48:02.478
[laughing]

48:04.849 --> 48:06.916
You don't know
   what you're talking about.

48:07.018 --> 48:08.951
Is it her you're fixated on?

48:09.053 --> 48:10.753
Or is it him?

48:10.855 --> 48:12.054
Shut up.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.491
I saw your computer.

48:15.593 --> 48:18.294
You've been watching them.
           It's sick.

48:19.364 --> 48:22.131
You... don't get to judge me.

48:22.233 --> 48:24.500
Just because you're so scared
  of your little pathetic life

48:24.602 --> 48:26.669
doesn't mean I have to be.

48:26.771 --> 48:28.604
I want more.

48:28.706 --> 48:31.741
-I want what I deserve.
    -You don't deserve them.

48:31.843 --> 48:34.076
You deserve so much worse.

48:34.178 --> 48:36.512
You're not gonna see them again.
        I won't let you.

48:37.048 --> 48:38.047
[scoffs]

48:40.785 --> 48:43.619
You're not gonna do anything.

48:43.721 --> 48:45.721
That's what you're good at.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.374
[Mara] <i> Beth?</i>

49:07.946 --> 49:10.947
<i> Beth, honey,</i>
      <i> what are you doin'?</i>

49:12.917 --> 49:14.583
Get out of my room.

49:18.790 --> 49:19.889
What are you doing?

49:19.991 --> 49:21.724
I won't let you
        hurt that family.

49:21.826 --> 49:23.993
Even if I have to tell them
             myself.

49:24.095 --> 49:25.461
Give it back!

49:26.230 --> 49:28.464
Give it back!

49:28.566 --> 49:29.999
-[Rachel] Give it back!
       -[banging on door]

49:30.101 --> 49:32.068
This is for your own good.

49:32.904 --> 49:34.937
[cellphone ringing]

49:39.177 --> 49:40.843
[cellphone beeps]

49:40.945 --> 49:42.078
Hi, Rachel.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.146
No, it's Sarah.
       You need to listen.

49:44.248 --> 49:46.182
Keep Rachel away
        from your family.

49:46.284 --> 49:48.584
-Excuse me?
   -She's been spying on you.

49:48.686 --> 49:51.754
I saw it on her computer.
  Cameras, all over your house.

49:51.856 --> 49:52.989
What are you talking about?

49:53.091 --> 49:54.690
Promise you won't
        see her anymore.

49:54.792 --> 49:56.359
-[banging on door]
        -She's trying...

49:56.461 --> 49:58.928
[Rachel grunts]
           No! No! No!

49:59.030 --> 50:00.062

50:02.767 --> 50:03.899
[Mara over phone]

50:05.336 --> 50:06.936
-[Mara] <i> Hello?</i>
       -[cellphone beeps]

50:08.706 --> 50:09.939
Hello?

50:10.641 --> 50:11.974
Hello?

50:32.196 --> 50:35.197
[breathing heavily]

50:37.135 --> 50:39.502
-Hey.
         -Where are you?

50:40.338 --> 50:41.804
Um, at the house.

50:41.906 --> 50:43.906
Just got back
     from dropping off Beth.

50:44.008 --> 50:46.575
-[Scott] <i> What's up?</i>
   -Is Rachel there with you?

50:46.677 --> 50:49.278
No. No, I sent her home.

50:49.380 --> 50:51.313
Hey, are you logged in
        to the vault app?

50:51.416 --> 50:54.316
No. No, I haven't all day.

50:54.419 --> 50:55.885
<i> Look, Mara, we need to talk.</i>

50:55.987 --> 50:57.453
<i> Okay? It's about Rachel.</i>

50:57.555 --> 50:59.255
Yeah, I know.
     I'm coming home early.

50:59.357 --> 51:02.058
Just, please,
      if Rachel comes back,

51:02.160 --> 51:03.659
<i> don't let her inside.</i>

51:03.761 --> 51:04.894
Okay.

51:04.996 --> 51:07.530
Okay. I'll be home soon.

51:07.632 --> 51:08.664
[hangs up call]

51:15.173 --> 51:16.572
[stammers] I don't know.
           It just...

51:16.674 --> 51:18.074
It doesn't make any sense.

51:18.176 --> 51:19.308
I know it doesn't.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.343
And I don't know
        what to believe.

51:21.446 --> 51:24.613
I mean, her mom
  did seem off when I met her.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.282
Do you think Rachel
     was telling the truth?

51:26.384 --> 51:28.451
I-I think so.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.186
All right, the way that
  she was talking about her dad

51:30.288 --> 51:32.988
I don't think she was
          making it up.

51:33.091 --> 51:34.790
I-I don't know,
  doesn't that make more sense

51:34.892 --> 51:36.625
than her spying on us?

51:36.727 --> 51:39.195
I mean, w-why,
     why would she do that?

51:43.601 --> 51:45.634
What?

51:45.736 --> 51:49.171
You can't think of any reason
     why she might want to?

51:49.273 --> 51:50.840
I mean, it has just been
      the two of you late--

51:50.942 --> 51:52.208
Oh, come on.

51:52.310 --> 51:55.077
Scott, I know nothing happened.

51:56.414 --> 51:58.347
I trust you,
      but isn't it possible

51:58.449 --> 52:01.250
that maybe she developed
       some kind of crush?

52:05.089 --> 52:06.522
[sighs]

52:06.624 --> 52:09.225
Yeah, there's one thing
       I didn't tell you.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.964
After she told me everything,

52:15.066 --> 52:17.733
I was trying
to comfort her and... [chuckles]

52:22.173 --> 52:23.506
she kissed me.

52:23.608 --> 52:25.341
-What?
            -I know?

52:25.443 --> 52:29.311
Okay? But I sent her home
        right after that.

52:29.413 --> 52:32.581
-Why didn't you tell me this?
        -I-I don't know.

52:32.683 --> 52:34.583
Okay? Look, I'm-I'm sorry.
         I just don't...

52:34.685 --> 52:37.319
I don't think she knew
       what she was doing.

52:37.421 --> 52:39.855
Okay, she just unloaded all of
 this emotional baggage onto me,

52:39.957 --> 52:42.158
and-and I think
     she was just confused.

52:44.428 --> 52:45.861
Look, I was gonna tell you,
           obviously.

52:45.963 --> 52:48.097
I'm just trying to make sense
         of all of this.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.334
You know what?
  Stay here with Beth and Amy.

52:53.504 --> 52:54.737
What? Wh-where are you going?

52:54.839 --> 52:56.238
I am gonna go see Rachel.

52:56.340 --> 52:57.840
I am getting
     to the bottom of this.

52:57.942 --> 52:59.275
No, you're not going
           over there.

52:59.377 --> 53:01.243
Yes, I am!

53:01.345 --> 53:04.613
Scott, our nanny
could be spying on us right now.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.582
Watching everything we do,

53:06.684 --> 53:09.518
hearing everything we say.

53:09.620 --> 53:12.955
Oh, the thought of it
      makes my skin crawl.

53:13.057 --> 53:15.791
I'm not gonna let
      some 20-year-old girl

53:15.893 --> 53:17.960
control our lives
       because of a crush.

53:18.062 --> 53:19.929
-I'm coming with you.
        -No, you're not!

53:20.031 --> 53:22.531
You have seen enough of Rachel.

53:24.468 --> 53:26.802
We'll talk about this
        when I get home.

Rachel?

55:41.739 --> 55:43.906
[device beeping]

55:55.786 --> 55:58.887
If you don't come out here right
  now, I am calling the police.

56:15.206 --> 56:17.206
[door creaking]

56:17.308 --> 56:19.141
What are you doing?

56:21.445 --> 56:23.178
[Mara] I talked to your mother.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.948
I saw your room.

56:27.318 --> 56:29.485
And we know
     what you've been doing.

56:30.888 --> 56:32.721
I don't know
   what you're talking about.

56:32.823 --> 56:35.691
Oh, give it up.

56:35.793 --> 56:38.594
And I can't believe
    you've been lying to us.

56:39.563 --> 56:40.763
Watching us.

56:40.865 --> 56:43.132
I'm only watching
        over the family.

56:43.868 --> 56:44.967
Just like you.

56:45.069 --> 56:47.469
It isn't your family!

56:47.571 --> 56:50.372
Of course it is.

56:50.474 --> 56:53.075
Who's the one actually
    taking care of your kids

56:53.177 --> 56:54.777
while you're at work?

56:55.846 --> 56:57.813
You've gotta be kidding me.

56:59.250 --> 57:01.283
You know I'm right.

57:01.385 --> 57:03.419
You're barely home.

57:03.521 --> 57:07.723
Choosing your own career
        over your family.

57:10.060 --> 57:12.361
Somebody needs to be home
           with them.

57:13.230 --> 57:14.563
Loving them.

57:14.665 --> 57:16.899
Appreciating them.

57:17.768 --> 57:19.701
Your mom was right.

57:20.538 --> 57:22.070
You're crazy.

57:22.840 --> 57:25.007
I am not crazy!

57:32.016 --> 57:36.585
You are never allowed
        in my home again.

57:38.022 --> 57:40.622
[Mara] If you try
        to come near us,

57:40.724 --> 57:43.025
or monitor us,

57:43.127 --> 57:44.526
I will call the police.

57:46.897 --> 57:48.831
And if you ever

57:48.933 --> 57:52.434
try to come between me
       and my family again

57:52.536 --> 57:56.171
I will come back here
and I will deal with you myself.

57:57.508 --> 57:59.107
Understood?

58:04.915 --> 58:07.149
[beeping]

58:09.854 --> 58:12.955
I've never come across
    a breach this bad before.

58:13.057 --> 58:16.492
Any idea how she got access?

58:16.594 --> 58:19.628
She, uh, helps manage
a lot of stuff around the house.

58:19.730 --> 58:21.263
I mean, she has
     most of our passwords.

58:21.365 --> 58:22.297
Yeah.

58:22.399 --> 58:23.432
And you didn't think to have

58:23.534 --> 58:24.800
a different master password

58:24.902 --> 58:25.934
for the device that controls

58:26.036 --> 58:27.769
your entire house?

58:27.872 --> 58:29.605
Uh, yeah, well,
     we didn't really expect

58:29.707 --> 58:32.040
our nanny to be a psycho
         and spy on us.

58:32.142 --> 58:34.710
Sorry, didn't mean anything
             by it.

58:34.812 --> 58:35.811
It's all right.

58:35.913 --> 58:36.845
The good news is

58:36.947 --> 58:38.947
she can't get in from now on.

58:39.049 --> 58:41.950
Okay? Here's your new password.

58:42.052 --> 58:44.953
Don't let anyone else see it.

58:45.055 --> 58:47.122
I've also added
 a second layer of authenticity.

58:47.224 --> 58:48.657
So if you wanna access the app,

58:48.759 --> 58:51.026
you're gonna need to verify
        via your phones.

58:51.128 --> 58:54.396
And I've limited remote access
to only your phones and laptops.

58:54.498 --> 58:55.864
No other device can sign in

58:55.966 --> 58:57.299
unless they're on
       your home network,

58:57.401 --> 58:58.567
have access to your phone,

58:58.669 --> 58:59.902
and know the password.

59:00.004 --> 59:02.538
Thank you for coming out
           so quickly.

59:02.640 --> 59:06.008
Ever since seeing her computer,
      I've felt so exposed.

59:06.110 --> 59:08.844
Yeah. Not a problem at all.

59:08.946 --> 59:10.746
I'm sorry this happened.

59:10.848 --> 59:14.550
We like to pride ourselves on
 being impenetrable, but, um...

59:14.652 --> 59:18.186
we never expect a threat to come
   from the inside, you know?

59:18.289 --> 59:19.655
All right. You take care now.

59:19.757 --> 59:21.023
-Thanks. You too.

59:32.469 --> 59:35.037
You mind watching the kids
       for a couple hours?

59:35.139 --> 59:36.772
Yeah. Why?

59:36.874 --> 59:39.441
I just wanna go get a couple
    of things for the house.

59:39.543 --> 59:41.376
Look, I'm glad we got the
 security system all sorted out,

59:41.478 --> 59:43.478
but I don't think I trust it
       on its own anymore.

59:44.882 --> 59:47.115
I-I just want to make sure
           we're safe.

-Hey.
              -Huh?

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:44.573
There's nothing
      to worry about, okay?

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:47.242
Yeah, I know.
      I'm just making sure.

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:54.416
I think I'm gonna call it
      a night. Do you mind?

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.418
No. No, I should call it, too.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.420

-Rachel!
              -Shh!

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:11.453
Hey, we have to get your
backpack and some clothes, okay?

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:12.888
-Okay.
           -All right.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.656
'Cause I'm gonna take you
         somewhere fun.

      it'll be so amazing.

Get up. We have to hurry.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.810
I've got something so fun
        planned for you.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.578
Stay here, okay?

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:42.450
What are you doing?

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:45.187
Stay out of this.
This has nothing to do with you.

01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:47.189
I'm taking her with me.

01:03:47.291 --> 01:03:49.758
Are you completely insane?

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.027
I'm not letting you
       take her anywhere.

01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:53.829
Come on, Beth. Come to mommy.

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:55.764
-Let go.
    -Come on, come to mommy.

Baby, it's okay.

Rachel, what are you...

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:05.440
-Let go of her. Let go of her.
              -No.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.142
Let go of her! Go with mommy.
         Go with mommy.

-No, no, no! Get out--

[Dan] What's going on?
      [Rachel] No! Let go!

Take the kids
     and go somewhere safe.

[Rachel] Dan, help!
        He's hurting me!

-Get somewhere safe!

  to stay inside the Kid Cave.

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:50.185
I need you to be as quiet
    as you can and stay put.

-No adults allowed in Kid Cave.

It doesn't have to be
        like this, Mara.

We can both have a family.

You can hand over Beth

until we break down the door.

          to break in.

Listen, listen,
       if I can sneak out

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.714
I can get to my phone
      and call the police.

-No. No, that's too dangerous.
              -No.

        -Well, maybe not.

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:09.457
But Rachel would.

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:13.961
She has some [chuckles]
      serious daddy issues.

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:18.399
Ah... works for me.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:25.073
Yeah, her mother
  had the same look on her face

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:27.375
when she found out
        we got together.

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:29.177
Sarah was a good woman,
      but that relationship

01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:30.745
was never gonna last.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:33.648
Rachel just has her way of,
        you know, just...

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:35.817
sinking her claws into you.

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:37.285
You know?

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:41.689
She usually gets what she wants.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:44.726
And she wants her family.

01:12:44.828 --> 01:12:46.094
So, I'm gonna give it to her.

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:47.328
[Amy crying]

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:50.398
[grunting]

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:02.410
[grunting]

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:03.945
Bitch!

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:09.417
Come on, fight me.
       Come on, fight me.

01:13:09.519 --> 01:13:11.486
[grunting]

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:27.435
Oh, my God!

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:29.637
Hey. Hey.

01:13:30.774 --> 01:13:32.006
Are you okay?

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:33.741
[Rachel] Mara!

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:35.476
[Rachel laughing]

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.078
[Amy crying]

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.214
I know you're here, Mara.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:49.557
Please...

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:53.928
Just let her go.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.999
-You know we're way beyond that.
          -[Amy crying]

01:13:58.568 --> 01:14:00.201
Ah...

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:02.069
Not so fast.

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:04.439
Drop it.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:05.606
You first.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.108
I mean it!

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:10.478
She's just a baby.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.946
You wouldn't hurt her.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:17.351
You really wanna
        take that chance?

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:20.955
[Amy crying]

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:24.725
Okay. Okay.

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:26.894
Okay. Just, please...

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:32.967
[sighs] I see, seeing
  that you have that, Dan is...

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:34.936
He didn't give me a choice.

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:37.972
[sighs] No...

01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:41.375
He served his purpose.

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:43.611
He was only good
      for one thing anyway.

01:14:45.515 --> 01:14:46.948
So, what happens now?

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.384
[sighs] What happens now

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:53.921
is you give me Beth

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.390
and we leave.

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:58.726
And if you try to stop us
       and call the police

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:02.830
I will kill you,
   your husband and your baby.

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:06.100
Why? Why are you doing this?

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:10.671
You'll never understand.

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:13.074
Then help me understand!

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:19.747
I know about your father.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:24.151
What he did to you
       and your mother...

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:28.155
and how it destroyed
          your family.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:31.859
And after he died,

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:35.930
I can understand
     you wanting that family

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.999
that you never had.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:42.403
But why like this?

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:45.907
-Why us?
 -Because you don't deserve her!

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:48.409
You never did!

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:50.111
[voice breaking] I did.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:55.583
I looked for her
       and never gave up.

01:15:55.685 --> 01:15:59.353
I kept looking and looking
         for four years.

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:06.861
Beth is your daughter.

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:11.332
[sobbing]

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:15.469
I never wanted to give her up.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.607
I was only 16
       when I was pregnant

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:22.577
and my mother
    wouldn't let me keep her.

01:16:22.679 --> 01:16:25.012
She was jealous of us.

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.849
She threatened to kick me out

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:30.451
and she said
    I was ruining the family

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:32.987
and I couldn't
    just leave her like that.

01:16:33.856 --> 01:16:35.756
She made me choose!

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.027
And I chose wrong.

01:16:41.531 --> 01:16:44.732
It was the biggest mistake
         I've ever made.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:51.038
And I'll never
    make that mistake again.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:55.042
Rachel...

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:57.545
I can't begin to understand

01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:59.880
how hard that was for you.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:05.052
-But this is not the way--
   -Don't tell me what to do!

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:07.989
Give me Beth, now!

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:10.191
You know I can't do that.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.694
I'm her mother, too.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:17.398
And you know better than anyone

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.468
what I will do to protect that.

01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:24.372
Then you leave me no choice.

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:34.448
[grunting]

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:47.528
I told you to stay away from my
             family.

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:55.736
That's ok, mommy's got you.

01:17:55.838 --> 01:18:06.681
[siren blaring]

01:18:06.783 --> 01:18:09.784

      -[instrumental music]

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.030
[alarm blaring]

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:46.587
[music continues]

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.794
[sighs] Come on.

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:57.998
Come on, don't do this to me.

01:18:58.101 --> 01:18:59.767
You havin' trouble?

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:02.803
Mm, I forgot how much
       I hate this thing.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:05.239
Well, we couldn't have at least
     kept the coffee maker?

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:06.674
And you're the one
         that said that

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:08.309
things that matter
       shouldn't be easy.

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:10.945
[laughs] Yeah, I did say that.

01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:12.446
Now you should be gloating.

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:15.416
You were right.
        The machines won.

01:19:15.518 --> 01:19:18.519
I forgot how much
    of a giant piece of sh...

01:19:20.289 --> 01:19:21.589
There it goes.

01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:24.225
-Success.
              -Hm.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:34.535
Mm...
        Heading to work?

01:19:34.637 --> 01:19:38.606
Yeah. But I shouldn't be
 at the office too late tonight.

01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:41.175
Okay. Have fun.

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:54.789
Good morning, Eric.

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:57.792
<i> Good morning. To what</i>
     <i> do I owe the pleasure?</i>

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.627
I just wanted to see
     if there were any fires

01:19:59.729 --> 01:20:01.028
before I dive in for the day.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.229
<i> No. We're all good.</i>

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:03.397
<i> How's everything on your end?</i>

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:06.167
<i> The new office going well?</i>

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:09.537
-Yeah. It's perfect.
             <i> -Good.</i>

01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:12.006
<i> Look, I just wanted to say</i>
      <i> I'm really glad that</i>

01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:14.642
<i> we could find a solution</i>
       <i> to keeping you on.</i>

01:20:14.744 --> 01:20:16.977
<i> InHabit is now trending</i>
        <i> because of you.</i>

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.546
[Eric laughs]

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:20.981
<i> Oh, that reminds me, um,</i>

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:23.751
<i> I wanted to talk to you</i>
    <i> about our presentation.</i>

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.052
<i> Maybe we can do lunch?</i>

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.654
I wish I could, but

01:20:26.756 --> 01:20:28.389
I've got lunch plans
         with the baby.

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:31.492
<i> Yeah, I know. Um, I figured</i>
      <i> I'd give it a shot.</i>

01:20:31.594 --> 01:20:33.694
<i> Uh, I'll email you the deck.</i>

01:20:33.796 --> 01:20:35.796
-Sounds good. Talk soon?
       -[Eric] <i> All right.</i>

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:37.131
-[Eric] <i> Take care.</i>
          -[key clacks]

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:41.669
Beth?

01:20:43.105 --> 01:20:44.905
Honey?

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:46.740
Are you out of bed yet?

01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:50.144
Beth?

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:52.613
[sighs]

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:56.851
Beth?

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:05.559
I just wanted to play.

01:21:05.661 --> 01:21:07.928
We talked about this.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:10.197
Come on, hand it over.

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:14.301
-Okay?
             -Okay.

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:15.402
Let's get you some breakfast

01:21:15.504 --> 01:21:17.872
and get you to school, huh?

01:21:17.974 --> 01:21:20.241
Yeah? Okay, let's go.

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:21.342
Come on.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:24.211
Yes, you do. You want some food?

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:27.114
Okay. Who wants pancakes
         for breakfast?

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:28.382
-I do.
             -I do.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:30.718
Yeah, pancakes.

01:21:33.022 --> 01:21:35.155
[device beeps]

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:36.590
[Mara] Bye, SAM.

01:21:36.692 --> 01:21:38.659
Bye, SAM.

01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:41.795
All right, baby girl. You wanna
   help me make some pancakes?

01:21:41.898 --> 01:21:43.397
-Yes!
             -Okay.

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.467
-Let's get you up here.
         -Pancake time.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:50.471
-Pancakes. Sit right there.
   -You want banana pancakes?

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:51.772
-Blueberry pancakes?
          -No, thanks.

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:53.240
"No, thanks?" Okay.

01:21:53.342 --> 01:21:56.243
-Banana pancake, pronto.
     -Banana pancakes it is.
