Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:05.960 --> 00:11.159
- All right, 1 955 AL MVP.
- Yogi Berra.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.390
All right, height of the left field wall
at Fenway.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.314
- The Green Monster is 37 feet high.
- Told you.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.068
All right, here you go.

00:20.240 --> 00:24.119
- lke Delock's lifetime ERA.
- 4:03. Had enough?

00:24.640 --> 00:27.393
Give it up, Norm. The woman's
a lean, mean trivia machine.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.676
- Unbelievable. You're the best.
- I know.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.956
- Ask me something.
- Forget it, Zeke.

00:32.119 --> 00:35.510
There aren't any questions
about wheat in there.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.395
Oh, and I suppose you know
everything that's in this book.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.039
- If it's in there, I know it.
- Yeah?

00:40.200 --> 00:42.236
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.835
What's the Library of Congress
card catalogue number?

00:49.920 --> 00:53.276
Seven, eight, zero, three,
four, seven, six.

00:53.480 --> 00:57.029
- That's not even close.
- What do you mean? Look there.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.872
What?

00:59.720 --> 01:02.234
That's it exactly.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.075
Hey, everybody. Guess what
I grew in my greenhouse?

02:16.240 --> 02:19.835
Not another potato that looks
like Richard Nixon.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.634
No, I learned the error
of my ways there.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.439
Yeah, I guess I was pretty
off the deep end then, huh?

02:25.600 --> 02:29.115
No, but this is nothing like that.
Look at that.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.834
A map of the Hawaiian lslands.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.277
See the little bumps in the exact shape
and formation of our 50th state.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.754
Come on, Cliff,
don't make me look, please.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.913
Normy, Normy, this is one of nature's
fascinating little mutations here.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.992
Resting in the hands
of one of her bigger ones.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.037
All right, no skin off my nose.

02:51.200 --> 02:55.352
I'll just put it in the bag
and take it on home.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.870
Hey, guess what's in the bag.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.275
"Human Sexuality"?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.590
You don't have to broadcast it.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.910
It happens to be assigned reading
for a required course.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.310
You're blushing.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.994
I am not blushing.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.559
I prefer to maintain a sense
of decorum, unlike you

03:18.720 --> 03:22.474
who brought in coloured slides
of your wedding night.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.998
They were a big hit.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.996
And your break was over
ten minutes ago.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.593
Oh, Carla, please.

03:29.760 --> 03:34.197
I have to come up with a topic
for my psychology paper by tonight.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.476
I'm at a complete loss.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.313
Of course I could turn out your
run-of-the-mill essay

03:39.480 --> 03:43.029
on sadomasochism, bestiality,
bondage and discipline...

03:43.200 --> 03:45.634
but I'm looking for something
with a little pizzazz.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.432
- Hello, everybody.
- Oh, Sam.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.478
Would you please see if you can
light a fire under the stick?

03:53.640 --> 03:55.039
She's been goofing off
for an hour.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.156
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. She's gotta write some paper

03:57.320 --> 04:00.835
about sex and she can't think
of anything to write about.

04:01.800 --> 04:06.794
You're kidding me. She studied
for a whole year at Sammy State.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.436
Hey there. I hear you're
writing a paper on sex.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.115
- Is there any way I can help out?
- Thank you, Sam.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.555
This paper is on human sexuality.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.597
No, come on, I'm serious.
I want to help.

04:22.760 --> 04:26.230
Well, it had occurred to me
to use you as a case study,

04:26.400 --> 04:30.791
but I lack the proper clinical distance,
so that's out of the question.

04:30.960 --> 04:31.995
What are you talking about?

04:32.160 --> 04:34.276
You got an A plus staring you
in the face, here.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.911
Come on, we're pals, aren't we?
Come on, let me feel useful.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.116
Well, you would be
an interesting study.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.068
Great. Kind of slow in here, why don't
you step into my laboratory.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.999
Well, all right. I am desperate.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.313
Sam...

04:53.480 --> 04:55.835
...this has to be done
in a professional manner.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.151
I hope you'll take this seriously.
I'm only this far away

04:59.320 --> 05:02.869
from a master's degree in--
Well, 37 different subjects.

05:04.120 --> 05:08.955
But if I do well in this class, psychology
could well become my major major.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.915
Wow, and we were here, huh, Cliff?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.875
We're always here.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.912
Sam, before we start,
I want to warn you.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.150
This will be frank and candid.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.676
We may be touching on some
highly sensitive areas.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.229
I like the sound of it already.

05:33.320 --> 05:35.595
Go ahead. Go ahead.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.671
Okay, why don't we start
with your parents.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.991
Would you describe them
as physically demonstrative?

05:41.160 --> 05:44.232
I'm here, aren't l?
They must have been.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.392
But why are you asking me
about my parents?

05:50.560 --> 05:53.472
I'm asking about your parents
to lay a psychological foundation

05:53.640 --> 05:56.234
- for your later behaviour.
- Boy, this isn't as much fun

05:56.400 --> 05:59.870
as I thought it was gonna be.
When are we gonna get to me?

06:00.040 --> 06:03.271
Okay, why don't we jump to your
relationships outside the family.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.589
Yeah.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.718
At what age did you have your
first sexual encounter?

06:07.880 --> 06:10.633
That's more like it. Okay.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.270
"Trevor, a Case Study."
Who's Trevor?

06:15.680 --> 06:19.036
- That's you.
- You're not gonna use my name?

06:19.520 --> 06:20.748
Of course not.

06:20.920 --> 06:25.675
So I do all the work
and this Trevor guy gets the credit?

06:26.720 --> 06:29.188
Sam, this is not your résumé.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.638
In a psychological treatise,
real names are never used.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.155
Yeah, but at least I should be able
to choose my own name.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.754
How about "Duke"?

06:39.640 --> 06:43.872
- This is my paper, and I like Trevor.
- All right. All right.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.271
Let's see where were we? You wanted
to know about my first time, right?

06:47.440 --> 06:50.273
Yes. How old were you?

06:51.760 --> 06:53.830
Boy, I'm not sure.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.278
I know I couldn't get to her house
until the crossing guard showed up.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.514
Wow. First time is kind
of hard to remember.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.717
- What about your first time?
- I'm the scientist, Sam.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.270
My first time has nothing
to do with this.

07:10.520 --> 07:13.114
But just to lay the subject to rest...

07:13.280 --> 07:16.875
...it was the summer of my 19th year.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.508
He was a young man in uniform.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.591
It was a brief encounter.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.309
He left my arms and went
to his doom.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.439
Oh, no, he was killed, huh?

07:27.600 --> 07:30.034
No, no, he went off to boot camp
and came back

07:30.200 --> 07:33.078
with the most God-awful haircut
I'd ever seen.

07:33.680 --> 07:39.118
Now, may we get back to you?
And limit your responses to attitudes.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.840
Please leave out the gory details.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.877
Now, what about your
second encounter?

07:44.040 --> 07:46.952
Well, that would be
the crossing guard.

07:58.200 --> 08:02.637
So, Woody, ready to take on Carla
in the sports trivia contest?

08:02.800 --> 08:06.395
Yeah, well, now, I've been studying
all week long, so go ahead.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.278
- Test me.
- All right.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.030
In what game did Ted Williams
break his elbow.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.396
Ted who?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.389
I'd take another quick peek
in the book, Woods.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.312
- Diane?
- Dr Greenspon.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.630
What on earth are you doing here?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.950
I just wanted to come by
and tell you in person,

08:32.120 --> 08:35.556
I've read your paper, and I think
it is absolutely extraordinary.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.392
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised

08:37.559 --> 08:40.870
if The New England Journal
of Psychology wanted to publish it.

08:41.039 --> 08:45.192
Forgive me for losing my academic
demeanour for a few moments.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.072
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.993
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love a beer, please.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.549
Wonderful. Coming right up.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.871
Of course I do have a couple
of reservations.

08:58.520 --> 09:03.514
Well, the most significant concerns
your psychological subject, Trevor.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.355
Since you seem to have found such a
near perfect example of Don Juanism,

09:07.520 --> 09:12.036
there are bound to be those who are
going to doubt this paper's authenticity.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.476
Doctor, I assure you,
every word is true,

09:15.640 --> 09:17.358
although I understand your doubt.

09:17.520 --> 09:21.115
It is hard to believe
that such a man exists.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.191
Doctor,

09:23.360 --> 09:25.590
have a seat over there
for just a couple of minutes.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.513
I'll join you soon.
There are a few things I have to do.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.833
- Sam.
- Yeah.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.798
Would you mind
if I revealed your identity

09:36.960 --> 09:39.428
to my psychology professor,
Dr Greenspon?

09:39.600 --> 09:42.831
Mind? Yo, doc, Trevor here.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.953
- Alias: Sam Malone.
- Lowell Greenspon.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.035
That's an amazing case history
you have.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.952
Yeah, isn't it? Knock on wood.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.156
So you'd say that the paper
is accurate?

09:54.320 --> 09:58.836
Well, now, we had to change a few
of the names to protect the satisfied.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.513
- Well, it's been very nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.911
- Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah. No, thank you very much.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.632
What a find you have there, Diane.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.870
So you really think it's publishable?

10:15.040 --> 10:17.270
Well, that brings me
to my other reservation.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.590
- What?
- In Trevor,

10:19.760 --> 10:23.116
you've shown us the cause, yes?

10:23.280 --> 10:26.590
What the paper lacks is the effect.

10:26.760 --> 10:31.311
Now, if you could possibly find one
of these conquests to learn

10:31.480 --> 10:33.835
why she's so gullible.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.878
What gives her such low self-esteem
so that she could possibly

10:38.040 --> 10:41.430
fall for this blatant manipulation.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.798
I don't know.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.748
Well, if you did, I don't see how
the Journal could fail to publish it.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.791
Hey, Woody.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.230
Come on, buddy,
get your nose out of that book.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.039
How much more trivia can you cram
into that head?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.475
Yeah, maybe you're right.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.837
My brain must be filled up,
because my hair hurts.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.509
Why don't you call Carla over
before I forget everything.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.989
Carla, you got a brash,
young challenger over here who says

11:20.160 --> 11:22.390
he's gonna boot you off the top
of sports trivia mountain.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.549
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:23.720 --> 11:27.156
Well, he said it before and I've always
left him bleeding in the dust.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.630
I say, Jethro goes down
in three questions.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.874
Okay, everybody, gather around
for the sports trivia championships.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.354
- Give me your best shot.
- Okay.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.353
What was the lowest round
ever recorded

11:42.520 --> 11:45.796
in a PGA-sanctioned
golf tournament?

11:46.520 --> 11:48.670
- Fifty-nine, Al Geiberger.
- He's right.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.035
All right.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.988
Who was the oldest
heavyweight champion?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.431
- Jersey Joe Walcott.
- Yeah. Bingo.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.790
- All right, those were easy questions.
- Two for two.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.758
You're gonna choke on this one.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.314
Who was the only pitcher to ever lose
a one-hitter in the World Series?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.438
- Bill Bevans.
- He did it.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.431
All right.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.431
New York Yankees, 1947,
against the Brooklyn Dodgers.

12:19.600 --> 12:23.229
- All right. That's good, Woody.
- Goodwoody. Elmer Goodwoody,

12:23.400 --> 12:25.231
shortstop, Boston Beaneaters.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.075
It's all right, buddy, take a rest.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.676
Take A Rest,
winner of the California Derby, 1 959.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.198
Ten-eighty to win,

12:35.360 --> 12:37.191
six-forty to place,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.749
three-twenty to show.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.593
- So you liked my rewrite?
- Oh, yes.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.273
I just can't get over it.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.319
I mean, who would have thought that
this "Colette" that you described

12:52.480 --> 12:58.555
as "rapturously beautiful, intelligent,
indeed brilliant with an ethereal quality"

12:58.720 --> 13:02.030
could be so easily manipulated
by Trevor.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.388
Trevor is not without his charms,
crude as they may be.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.438
Well, but they're so transparent.
The woman would have to be addled.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.831
- She'd have to be totally lacking.
- Thank you. Your point is made.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.996
Oh, hi, doc.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.948
- Oh, my, is that the paper there?
- This is it.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.111
You know, I still haven't had a chance
to read that.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.316
- Mind if I take a look?
- You wouldn't enjoy it.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.913
Oh, don't be modest, Diane.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.799
I'm looking forward to your
presentation of it in class tonight.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.757
- Thank you, doctor.
- Tonight?

13:29.920 --> 13:32.593
Hey, you know, wait a second,
I'm the headline act of that thing.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.479
- You mind if I sit in on class?
- Oh, Sam.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.313
- You wouldn't enjoy the class, either.
- It's very dry and boring.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.392
No reflection on you, professor.
I mean to someone

13:42.560 --> 13:45.711
of Sam's limited intelligence.
No reflection on you, Sam.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.475
What I mean is, don't you have
to cover for Woody tonight?

13:49.640 --> 13:52.632
Oh, you're right. Darn it.
Well, too bad, huh? Doc.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.756
Shoot,
and that did sound like fun too.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.194
Wait a second, I've got an idea.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.873
Why don't you bring them
all over here.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.873
Kind of a field trip.
See Trevor in action.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.709
We could hardly do that.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.031
But I don't think some of the members
would mind coming by for a drink after.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.272
It would give them a chance to meet
the clinical case in the flesh.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.830
Oh, I'm not going to promise that.
We'll just see how the evening goes.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.032
He's remarkable.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.710
Sam.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.429
- Sam.
- No, not now.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.388
I'm going to prepare my lecture, here.
You know, it's about time

14:29.560 --> 14:33.792
I gave something back to the sport
that's given me so much.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.794
Sam, I think you should read this
after all.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.437
It's not what you think.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.068
If you change your mind
about the class coming here tonight,

14:43.240 --> 14:46.198
call me at home. I'll understand.

14:54.160 --> 15:00.474
"The Don Juan Syndrome
in Modern Culture: An Analysis of...

15:00.640 --> 15:05.191
...Sat-- Sate-- Sater-- Satyriasis."

15:05.760 --> 15:10.072
Oh, man, she did it.
She even made my sex life boring.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.789
And not for the first time.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.314
Excuse me,
is there a Cliff Clovin here?

15:26.080 --> 15:28.992
It's Cliff Clavin, partner,
and you're looking at him.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.799
Oh, hi.
I'm a reporter from the Chronicle.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.110
You the guy that sent in this picture
of a squash

15:34.280 --> 15:38.558
- with the Hawaiian lslands on it.
- Yeah. Yeah. What did I tell you guys?

15:38.720 --> 15:41.632
This is one story
they couldn't squash.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.154
There you go.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.515
To be honest,
it's not the squash I'm looking for.

15:45.680 --> 15:50.674
Actually, it's a part of a larger story
on eccentrics here in Boston.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.751
You know, the lunatic fringe.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.753
Lonely people desperate for attention.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.478
Yeah, yeah, but where do I fit in?

15:57.640 --> 16:01.030
You come right after the old lady
with the 84 snakes.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.870
Okay, I'm insulted,
and I'll thank you to leave this bar.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.835
They don't pay me enough.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.119
Cliffy. All right,
you stuck up to that guy.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.078
- You didn't let him exploit you.
- Yeah. Who the hell they think

16:14.240 --> 16:15.559
they're dealing with.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.917
I ain't giving my squash second billing
to a broad with a bunch of snakes.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.789
Hey, how would you like to get a look
inside that old bag's head, huh?

16:25.440 --> 16:28.159
Professor Malone, I think you've got
a little class in session there.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.198
Hi, doc. Over here.
Welcome, everybody.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.715
Why don't you come over
and take a seat anywhere over here.

16:33.880 --> 16:37.873
There's no need to be so formal,
but if you have something prepared.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.395
Oh, just a few things
off the top of my head.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.836
Did you bring an apple
for the teacher?

16:45.320 --> 16:46.548
- Sam.
- Yeah.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.836
I didn't hear from you,
so I assume you read the paper.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.752
Paper? Oh, yeah.
Couldn't put it down.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.911
Are you sure you still want
to go through with this?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.719
- Oh, absolutely.
- But, Sam, I don't feel this--

16:55.880 --> 16:57.393
No, come on. Take a seat here.

16:57.560 --> 17:01.917
Don't want to be late for class.
Okay, sit down.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.912
Welcome, everybody.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.390
Now, I realize you came here
to meet me and find out

17:07.560 --> 17:11.394
what makes a guy like me tick.
So I asked myself:

17:11.560 --> 17:14.154
"What makes you so different
from everybody else

17:14.319 --> 17:16.628
when it comes to scoring big
with women?"

17:16.800 --> 17:20.792
And I think it's--
I think it's this: I love ladies.

17:20.960 --> 17:25.670
I love the way they smell,
the way they sound, the way they feel.

17:25.839 --> 17:29.037
And by the way, that shade
of lipstick really compliments

17:29.200 --> 17:31.794
that rosy glow on your cheeks.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.311
- Unbelievable.
- Now, see, I'm not the only one

17:34.480 --> 17:35.913
who thinks that.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.514
Okay. All right, let's--
Enough about me here.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.432
Let's open up this discussion
a little bit.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.113
- What's your name, son?
- Barry.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.554
Barry. All right, Barry.

17:43.720 --> 17:48.157
Why don't you tell me what you do
when you meet a girl for the first time.

17:48.320 --> 17:52.950
Well, I talk to her and I let her know
that I respect her as a human being.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.236
I ask her out
without putting any pressure on her,

17:55.400 --> 17:59.313
and I let the relationship
grow naturally.

18:00.680 --> 18:04.514
Well, we all have some
pretty crazy ideas when we're young.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.832
Okay, can anyone tell me
where Barry went off the beam?

18:12.280 --> 18:14.840
Miss Chambers has a thought here.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.394
All right. Well, all right, I guess so.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.791
We can take five here.
Smoke them if you got them.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.828
- You didn't read this, did you?
- Didn't have to, I lived it.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.798
Sit down, please.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.753
"Trevor is the image
of the arrested adolescent,

18:38.920 --> 18:40.990
entirely self-oriented,

18:41.160 --> 18:42.991
still intimidated
by the women around him

18:43.160 --> 18:46.357
and attempting
to prove himself superior to them.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.876
Through sexual conquest he can,
for a time, quell his constant fears

18:50.040 --> 18:52.508
of inferiority and failure.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.475
Indeed,
the idea of a nonsexual relationship

18:55.640 --> 18:57.119
is completely foreign to him.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.477
As the years pass and his physical
attractiveness diminishes,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.791
he'll be doomed to a life
of loneliness and despair,

19:03.960 --> 19:06.679
unable to give or receive love."

19:12.200 --> 19:16.830
- Is this really how you feel about me?
- This is my clinical view of you.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.230
As a woman,
I might have felt something different

19:19.400 --> 19:21.470
than I feel as an academician.

19:21.640 --> 19:25.918
It makes my life seem so cheap
and pathetic.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.231
- Sam, you're reading things into this.
- Like here where it says:

19:29.400 --> 19:31.834
"His life is cheap and pathetic."

19:36.880 --> 19:39.348
Don't be hurt.
I hate it when you're hurt.

19:39.520 --> 19:43.069
This is not a true picture of you.

19:43.240 --> 19:47.472
I exaggerated in order
to corroborate my thesis.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.358
Boy, I don't know.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.795
Maybe I am gonna end up this way.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.554
You're not listening to me.
This is a paper.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.234
Theory and conjecture.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.595
I was going for a grade.
I told the professor

20:04.760 --> 20:06.432
what I thought he wanted to hear.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.795
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.030
I mean, everything in here is true,

20:11.200 --> 20:15.796
including the part about I've never
had a nonsexual relationship.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.714
Now, there, that's a good example
of exaggeration.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.030
You and I have
a nonsexual relationship.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.428
How can you say that?

20:23.600 --> 20:27.036
Well, I think that the fact
that we don't have sex is a major hint.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.709
That's just because we promised
to try to keep our distance.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.110
And we have.

20:34.280 --> 20:38.114
Our relationship has reached
the mature adult stage.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.589
Well, I wish there
were some way I could...

20:41.760 --> 20:43.637
...prove it to you.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.913
Well, maybe there is.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.958
Sit on my lap.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.271
I'm just trying to convince myself
that I can be close to a woman

20:54.440 --> 20:57.034
without it being sexual.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.432
- This is the silliest thing I've ever--
- Hey, come on, Diane.

21:03.400 --> 21:07.359
Well, if it'll help prove something
to you, all right.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.792
- Boy, you're nervous.
- I am not.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.598
- There, we did it.
- Hey, come on.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.957
Come on, you can't just get up
like that. That doesn't prove anything.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.759
Come sit here, and let's just try
to have a normal conversation.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.316
There is nothing normal about this.

21:29.160 --> 21:34.109
- What do you want to talk about?
- It doesn't matter. Anything.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.918
- How about the weather?
- Okay.

21:36.520 --> 21:40.911
- Nice weather.
- A little nippy.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.071
Well, that's because we're in Boston.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.676
Now, if we were in, say, Tahiti.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.035
- We'd be lying in the sun.
- Getting a tan.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.954
Maybe even a sunburn.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.829
Well, not if we rubbed oil
all over each other.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.353
What are we trying to prove again?

22:03.520 --> 22:06.353
Something about that I can carry
on a normal conversation

22:06.520 --> 22:09.318
- without it being sexual.
- Well, so much for the weather.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.914
- Yeah.
- How about music?

22:12.080 --> 22:15.868
- No, we don't like the same music.
- Well, we can talk about that.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.470
- All right. I like rock 'n' roll.
- I like classical.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.312
- Harmonies.
- Grandeur.

22:22.480 --> 22:26.758
- The hot guitar licks.
- The strings washing over you

22:26.920 --> 22:29.195
in a darkened concert hall.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.430
The driving beat.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.550
The low moan of the cello.

22:38.720 --> 22:42.395
The drums, pounding,
pounding, pounding.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.997
- But if we don't agree, we don't agree.
- Yeah, right.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.958
- What's that leave us?
- Religion.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.348
Religion. All right, the Bible.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.509
- Adam.
- Eve.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.069
- Fig leaves.
- Sin. All right.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.674
- Okay.
- Well, I think we've proved our point.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.195
Clearly we have
a nonsexual relationship.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.793
And you are a fine human being.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.916
- Well, thank you, Diane.
- So if you'll excuse me,

23:04.080 --> 23:06.958
I'm going to go out there and tell them
my paper is completely invalid.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.315
- There you go.
- Your knob.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.799
Yes, I believe so.
