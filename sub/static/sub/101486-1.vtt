10:23.106 --> 10:24.623

10:24.699 --> 10:28.117

You missed dinner.

10:35.410 --> 10:38.136

at the plant.

10:38.213 --> 10:41.973
You know what's cool is
spending time with your family.

10:42.050 --> 10:44.258
-That's not cool.
-Yeah, Mom, it really isn't.

10:44.335 --> 10:47.428
I agree with Mom
on everything but this.

10:47.505 --> 10:49.147
I'm sorry. Definitely not cool.

10:49.224 --> 10:50.932
Oh, all right, all right.

10:51.008 --> 10:54.060

in this town.

10:54.137 --> 10:57.155

She came, she inspired Lisa

11:06.241 --> 11:08.991

11:09.002 --> 11:10.952
Well, we really should do
a little work.

11:11.028 --> 11:13.246
Yeah. I have a whole inbox

bothering you?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.419
-Oh, back off, Smithers.
-ALL: Whoa!

11:19.495 --> 11:22.338
I'll box your ears next time you
speak to me with such insolence.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.465
Yes, sir.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.509
Oh, my God.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.011
You totally pwned him.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.189
Hmm. I suppose I did pwn him.

11:31.266 --> 11:32.857
I did.

11:32.934 --> 11:34.434
Ugh, that was quite

11:34.510 --> 11:36.811
I better go take
a three-hour nap.

11:36.888 --> 11:39.021
No, no, wait. While Smithers
is off drowning his sorrows

11:39.032 --> 11:42.650

Burns is unprotected.

11:42.727 --> 11:44.193
This is the perfect time
for you to represent us

11:44.204 --> 11:46.112

11:49.117 --> 11:50.867
Oh, I wouldn't. I-I couldn't.

For your friends.

11:56.073 --> 11:57.882
I won't let you down.

You down, you down, you down.

Don't you understand, Burns?

12:06.634 --> 12:08.885
Without the workers,
this plant is nothing.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.219
If you give them respect,

12:10.230 --> 12:11.846
it comes back to you
a hundredfold.

12:11.923 --> 12:14.223
(chuckles)
Respect the workers?

12:14.234 --> 12:17.569
What next? Put batteries
in the smoke detectors?

12:17.645 --> 12:20.146
Have you no heart?

12:20.223 --> 12:21.814
I certainly do.

12:21.891 --> 12:24.409
I'm not flooding this room
with mustard gas right now.

12:24.486 --> 12:28.029
I'll give you a chance to tell
your buddies that you failed.

12:28.105 --> 12:32.325
But then they might not
like me anymore.

12:32.401 --> 12:35.369
You're right. Friendship
<i> is</i> something worth treasuring.

Boy, he's really raking Burns
over the coals.

Yeah, I like how they're not
interrupting each other.

-BURNS: Yes, spirits, yes.

everything they want.

Montgomery Burns died
when I put on this suit.

13:06.769 --> 13:08.361
And six other times this week.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.988

and kidneys.

Oh, no. It's in the air.
