00:33.000 --> 00:34.411
<i>His ring...</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:37.843
<i>I spent hours picking it out.</i>

00:39.073 --> 00:40.484
<i>Not knowing...</i>

00:41.909 --> 00:44.788
<i>I tried to ignore the signs, but...</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:47.017
<i>I could smell her on his clothes.</i>

00:48.682 --> 00:51.060
<i>Taste her on his lips.</i>

00:51.151 --> 00:53.461
<i>He confessed. He cried.</i>

00:53.554 --> 00:55.693
<i>I told him I forgave him, but...</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:58.267
<i>I didn't.</i>

00:59.460 --> 01:00.837
<i>I was broken.</i>

01:02.362 --> 01:04.137
<i>But I guess...</i>

01:04.230 --> 01:07.110
<i>none of us are perfect.</i>

01:10.471 --> 01:13.384
This is the hottest place in town.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.546
Really?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.560
This place is all kinds of wrong.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.455
Yeah, exactly, and it's perfect for you.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.683
Come on.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.124
You should go talk to him.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.219
I can talk to those boys any time.

01:59.319 --> 02:00.889
This is our weekend.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.366
You're right. We stick together.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.232
You ladies need a round?

02:05.926 --> 02:08.137
Not from you, Red. Thanks.

02:08.228 --> 02:10.071
I'll get us cocktails.

02:10.163 --> 02:13.475
No, I'll do it.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.043
That waitress looked
just like the home-wrecker.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.323
What are you looking for?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.958
Something to make me forget.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.390
If it were only that easy.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.405
You're staring.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.301
I'm sorry.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.537
You remind me of someone.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.544
I hope it's not a bad memory.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.046
She was...

02:54.741 --> 02:57.017
very special to me.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.729
Thank you.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.395
It's good.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.937
Hey, barman,
can I talk to you for a minute?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.199
My name's Patrick.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.501
Tara.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.598
Tara.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.972
Hey, buddy?

03:19.066 --> 03:20.977
Can I talk to you?

03:21.068 --> 03:23.105
You should probably
go take care of that guy.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.474
I don't want to look away.

03:26.573 --> 03:27.847
Why not?

03:27.941 --> 03:29.579
You might disappear.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.384
Nice ink.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.492
Christ, man, get over here!

03:37.584 --> 03:39.393
I'll be right back.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.035
Hey, what the fuck is this?

03:45.125 --> 03:47.571
I'm not paying $40 for two fucking drinks.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.672
You don't have to drink it.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.903
- You can leave.
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

04:01.441 --> 04:02.579
Let's go.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.653
What did you say to that guy?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.060
Nothing.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.659
I sent you all a round.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.699
Thank you.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.506
What do I owe you?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.601
It's on me.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.531
That was so cool!

04:49.623 --> 04:52.194
Where do we get a car?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.033
I gotta go.

04:54.127 --> 04:57.836
Hey, that bartender
you were talking to earlier.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.911
He's standing over there.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.238
He's so hot.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.147
He's so cute. You should go talk to him.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.014
- Shut up.
- You were already talking to him!

05:08.108 --> 05:09.280
I'm not going to talk to him.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.447
- You were flirting with him.
- You totally were.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.354
Speak louder, that would be great.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.358
- Just talk to him.
- I hate you.

05:17.884 --> 05:18.954
Hi.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.101
You again.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.298
Me again.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.589
I should be going.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.100
Thank you.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.272
Good night.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.007
Shut up. So what?

06:30.757 --> 06:33.135
Who keeps calling?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.227
Man...

06:37.364 --> 06:38.968
No one.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.375
All right, ladies,
it's time for Bloody Marys.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.399
I can't.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.048
You're awake.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.518
Where are my clothes?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.658
They smelled like a club.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.456
I washed them for you.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.634
You washed my clothes?

10:56.723 --> 10:58.259
When?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.168
Couldn't sleep, really.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.070
Don't worry, I handwashed your dress.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.171
They're in the bathroom.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.978
Would you like some coffee?

11:13.073 --> 11:14.711
I brewed some.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.651
Yeah, sure.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.983
Do you have a T-shirt or something?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.561
Yeah, in the wardrobe.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.229
What's mine is yours.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.604
You take sugar and cream?

11:42.769 --> 11:44.874
You know, I...

11:44.971 --> 11:47.508
I'm probably gonna skip
the coffee, actually.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.218
Do you wanna grab breakfast?

11:55.982 --> 11:58.258
I know a place that serves great crepes.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.989
Best in New Orleans.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.036
So?

12:11.931 --> 12:13.706
I have to get going.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.412
- So soon?
- Yeah.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.019
Well, wait. I want to show you something.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.116
You know, I have to catch a flight.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.214
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- It's important.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.020
Okay. What is it?

12:38.324 --> 12:41.237
I meet a lot of girls, and...
but you, you're...

12:45.732 --> 12:47.268
From the moment I met you...

12:49.936 --> 12:51.711
I knew you'd come back for me.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.383
Come back?

12:56.476 --> 12:57.853
Yeah.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.357
You're the one who can save me.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.966
You don't like it?

13:12.058 --> 13:13.867
I did it for you.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.304
I'm sorry. This was a mistake.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.137
Don't say that. We have something special.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.609
No, I... I really should have never come.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.575
Don't leave.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.718
You know, I...

13:28.808 --> 13:30.810
I've got to catch my flight.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.618
Why? Stay.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.430
I can't.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.964
I really have to go.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.039
- It's just...
- It's okay.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.408
I need to go now.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.607
Oh, my God. You do realize
our plane leaves in an hour.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.472
Yes, I know.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.170
What the hell happened to you last night?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.475
I fucked up. I don't want to talk
about it right now.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.443
Where's Justine?

14:33.539 --> 14:34.916
She left already.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.423
I can't find my phone.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.323
- Here, I'll call it.
- Thanks.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.810
I don't hear it anywhere.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.983
Shit. My whole life is in that thing, man.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.419
Well, it's too bad.
You're gonna have to buy a new one.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.817
Let's just go, I gotta get out of here.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.246
Hi.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.874
Welcome home, sweetheart.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.646
You're the best.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.813
So, how was the bachelorette weekend?

15:44.911 --> 15:46.788
You know, we did a bunch of girly stuff.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.950
You would have hated it.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.391
You're such a gentleman.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.587
He is.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.493
Look. It's a picture of your sister.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.930
I told you those dresses were gonna look
great on everyone.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.460
Don't say anything.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.266
Don't say anything. It's not worth it.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.867
What are we whispering about?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.308
Well, if we told you,
it wouldn't be a secret.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.606
- I gotta go.
- Bye.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.510
Bye, sweetheart.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.207
- Debra.
- Bye.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.342
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.587
So, I'm...

16:19.679 --> 16:23.486
I'm not gonna really be seeing very much
of you these next couple of weeks, am I?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.961
I just need to finish planning everything.

16:26.052 --> 16:26.996
Okay.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.193
I just want one last night.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.571
What's up with your phone?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.105
I've been trying to call.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.064
So, how we doing today?

17:09.262 --> 17:10.468
Well...

17:14.467 --> 17:16.571
I couldn't be better.

17:16.669 --> 17:17.977
I'm in love.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.176
That's great.

17:26.145 --> 17:28.125
She's an angel.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.819
Definitely not this.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.761
- Not this...
- Okay.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.628
You know, I like this for sure.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.496
Okay.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.864
This one, I'm not so sure about.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.164
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, one sec.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.829
Sure.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.238
Excuse me. Hey, babe.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.937
Just wanted to let you know
that I picked up my tux,

17:48.034 --> 17:49.707
and I'm officially done.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.372
<i>I hate you.</i>

17:51.471 --> 17:54.213
Wait. Does that mean
that the wedding is off?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.513
That's such a bummer.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.679
I am so swamped right now.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.347
I have so much more to do.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.356
You know what, babe,
can I call you back in a few?

18:01.447 --> 18:02.448
<i>No, wait.</i>

18:02.548 --> 18:04.528
I want to see you tonight.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.528
Alone.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.791
<i>I don't know, Michael.</i>

18:07.887 --> 18:09.457
<i>I have so many plans to get done.</i>

18:09.555 --> 18:10.499
- <i>And I'm just...</i>
- Babe?

18:10.590 --> 18:11.830
- <i>I'm feeling...</i>
- Babe.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.301
You need to relax, all right?

18:13.392 --> 18:16.066
It's just... just one night.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.704
Okay. When and where?

18:21.934 --> 18:22.912
Where, when?

18:23.002 --> 18:26.976
I'll be at your place at 6:00,
unless I can get out of the hotel earlier.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.053
Okay, it's a date.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.482
I got caught up in the moment, but...

21:35.861 --> 21:37.340
I've missed this.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.738
Me, too.

21:40.032 --> 21:43.206
- What's wrong?
- What are you doing here?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.543
- No, get out!
- Just calm down.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.551
If you don't get out of here right now,
I am calling the cops.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.121
- No...
- Whoa. Hey. Hey!

21:55.948 --> 21:57.120
Oh, my God.

21:57.216 --> 22:00.823
Hey, listen. I just wanted to see you.

22:04.690 --> 22:05.964
That's all.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.000
How did you find me?

22:14.533 --> 22:16.137
You left your phone.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.516
All right, I get it.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.553
I understand. You're surprised to see me.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.921
Maybe if you give me
a chance to talk about it...

22:33.018 --> 22:34.258
No. No.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.128
I have nothing to say to you.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.901
Michael's gonna be here any minute.

22:41.727 --> 22:42.933
Michael?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.537
Michael, your fiancé?

22:52.738 --> 22:55.275
You haven't told him
about us yet, have you?

22:59.612 --> 23:01.523
You know what? Look, I'm...

23:03.115 --> 23:05.823
I'm sorry if I misled you.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.623
But I want to make this perfectly clear.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.670
There is nothing between us.

23:17.263 --> 23:18.742
You don't believe that.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.239
I love you.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.049
I don't understand why
you can't do me the courtesy...

23:30.142 --> 23:31.951
of just talking with me.

23:33.846 --> 23:37.589
Maybe if you open up,
then maybe you'll see...

23:38.951 --> 23:40.055
Shit!

23:40.152 --> 23:41.722
You have to get out of here right now!

23:41.821 --> 23:43.596
- Get out!
- Not out.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.430
Not until you talk to me.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.834
- You say you love me?
- Yes.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.101
And you don't want to hurt me?

23:51.197 --> 23:52.175
Of course not.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.245
Then I need you to leave right now.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.836
- Please.
- I won't go anywhere

23:56.936 --> 23:58.779
until you tell me you'll meet me.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.681
- Okay, yes, I'll meet you.
- Where?

24:04.243 --> 24:07.247
There's a coffee shop on Lincoln,
just south of Pico.

24:07.346 --> 24:10.624
I can meet you there at 10:00 tomorrow,
but only if you leave now.

24:10.716 --> 24:12.718
- Please.
- Ten.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.024
Yes.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.269
Babe?

24:24.430 --> 24:25.875
You all right?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.410
Yeah.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.979
Yeah, I was...

24:29.068 --> 24:31.207
I was about to get in the shower,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.340
and I thought I heard a noise.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.385
Noise?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.977
What was the noise?

24:38.077 --> 24:40.455
It was nothing.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.820
Okay.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.856
All right, well, why don't you go get ready,
because we have an earlier reservation.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.329
Okay.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.133
Are you sure you're okay?

24:52.224 --> 24:54.067
Yeah. Yes.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.140
I'll go get dressed.

24:57.229 --> 24:58.299
Okay.

25:19.118 --> 25:23.631
So, everything's booked, set up
at the hotel for all the wedding guests.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.131
You know, I was also thinking that...

25:31.730 --> 25:32.868
Hey?

25:32.965 --> 25:34.137
What?

25:36.702 --> 25:39.774
I can't help but feel like
I'm dining alone here.

25:43.809 --> 25:46.255
I'm sorry.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.383
I've just been really overwhelmed lately.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.171
You know, it was...

26:01.260 --> 26:04.639
only a one-time thing, right?

26:04.730 --> 26:07.677
I hate that you found her card
before I could tell you.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.268
It almost ruined us.

26:12.705 --> 26:16.118
Every single day,

26:16.208 --> 26:17.744
I am thankful for...

26:19.511 --> 26:21.616
I mean, you gave me a second chance.

26:23.082 --> 26:27.720
If you're having second thoughts
or doubts, just tell me.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.424
No.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.501
No, absolutely not.

26:32.858 --> 26:36.396
There is no one in this world
that I love more than you.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.998
And I'm so sorry

26:39.098 --> 26:42.238
if I've been distracted this past week.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.508
It's not you.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.418
It's the wedding.

26:48.507 --> 26:51.784
I mean, I don't know
how people go through this process

26:51.877 --> 26:54.118
and still stay together, but...

26:56.248 --> 26:58.125
I love you.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.753
And I'm excited.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.862
I love you.

28:09.722 --> 28:12.259
All right, rise and shine.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.428
You can't sleep the day away, babe.

28:17.062 --> 28:18.564
So, you're gonna be like that, are you?

28:19.898 --> 28:21.673
Are you all right?

28:21.767 --> 28:23.747
Yeah.

28:23.836 --> 28:26.077
I just... I had a bad dream.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.411
Okay.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.750
You expecting someone this early?

28:33.846 --> 28:35.154
No.

28:36.749 --> 28:40.196
No. You just go get dressed,
and I'll get the door.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.868
Well, whoever it is,
they are awfully persistent.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.832
All right, I'm coming.

28:56.602 --> 28:57.876
Hello, Debra.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.280
Hey. Tara! Tara!

29:00.372 --> 29:02.249
Please, come on in.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.216
Tara.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.312
Hey, come on, girl, get dressed.
We gotta go.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.686
What are you talking about?

29:08.781 --> 29:10.351
Our spa day, remember?

29:10.449 --> 29:11.860
- Shit.
- Yeah.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.055
No, I can't. I've got
an appointment this morning.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.598
With who?

29:15.687 --> 29:16.859
No one. I just, I have...

29:16.955 --> 29:19.458
Okay, well, you're gonna have to cancel.

29:19.558 --> 29:22.095
Well, that does not sound like
anything I want to be a part of,

29:22.194 --> 29:24.765
but have fun, love you.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.002
- Debra.
- Bye.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.976
What are you doing? Get dressed.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.809
All right, just...

29:31.904 --> 29:34.009
- Five minutes.
- Okay.

30:10.108 --> 30:11.519
You came.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.817
Of course I did.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.127
Before you say anything...

30:20.886 --> 30:23.628
I've thought a lot about what you said.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.703
And you're right.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.374
I'm right?

30:33.398 --> 30:35.378
We belong together.

30:39.905 --> 30:42.146
I want to hear you say something.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.388
Anything.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.919
Tell me you love me.

31:00.158 --> 31:02.604
With all my soul.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.072
More coffee?

31:05.163 --> 31:07.006
What?

31:07.099 --> 31:08.806
More coffee?

31:21.747 --> 31:24.284
Wait. Who were you supposed
to be meeting with this morning?

31:24.383 --> 31:26.420
I don't want to talk about it.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.758
Listen, I get it, girl.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.161
Weddings are really stressful.

31:29.254 --> 31:30.426
Do you want a Valium?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.559
No, no. It's not that.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.196
It's him.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.172
Who's him?

31:38.263 --> 31:39.833
Patrick.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.878
He showed up at my house.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.705
Wait. That guy you hooked up with
two weeks ago?

31:49.808 --> 31:52.652
Christ. And you were gonna meet with him?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.724
Yeah, to tell him to stay away.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.520
I can't have him showing up
at my house, Deb.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.958
No... Absolutely not.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.394
You don't go meet with him, okay?

32:00.485 --> 32:02.123
You have to cut him off completely.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.790
He'll just keep coming around.

32:03.889 --> 32:06.028
Trust me.

32:25.577 --> 32:26.681
<i>Yeah, you're probably right.</i>

32:26.778 --> 32:28.348
<i>Yeah, of course I'm right.</i>

32:28.447 --> 32:32.324
And if he comes around again, call me,
and I will take care of the little prick.

32:33.652 --> 32:34.892
Okay?

32:36.221 --> 32:38.326
Hey, come on.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.363
Forget about weirdo stalkers.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.168
It's gonna be fine.

33:08.387 --> 33:12.231
Hey, after the fitting, remind me to check
the flower arrangements and the cake.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.769
Yeah, I'm on it.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.135
Hi.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.799
Miss Bloom?

33:19.898 --> 33:21.400
I am so sorry.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.810
I just heard.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.176
Just heard what?

33:25.270 --> 33:27.011
Your fiancé or your ex,

33:27.105 --> 33:30.348
he called to let us know
that the wedding had been canceled.

33:32.277 --> 33:34.154
- We should...
- No, no, no.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.523
Michael called?

33:37.449 --> 33:39.156
You didn't know?

33:39.251 --> 33:40.628
I'm so sorry.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.290
He said there was a change of plans.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.835
No, no. That's... That's a mistake.

33:46.925 --> 33:49.371
This doesn't make any sense.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.405
- This is...
- No.

33:50.495 --> 33:51.838
Men do get cold feet.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.967
No. That's... That's really not helping.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.704
Seriously.

33:55.801 --> 33:56.779
This makes no sense.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.745
No, Michael wouldn't do this.

34:01.406 --> 34:04.512
Yes, I understand
we will have to forfeit the deposit.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.424
Yes, I guess some things
just weren't meant to be.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.226
Thank you.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.858
Don't take any other orders
from anyone but me, please.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.524
No, I just told you,
the wedding is not canceled.

34:17.621 --> 34:20.864
Hold on. No, that wasn't my fiancé.
No, that wasn't my fiancé.

34:20.958 --> 34:24.371
Yes, I understand that you're confused.
I have another call.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.603
Yes, I understand that your time
is valuable. I'm paying for it, aren't I?

34:28.699 --> 34:30.610
I understand that,
but the wedding is not canceled.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.545
I understand that, just, can you just
please keep on with the cake?

34:33.638 --> 34:35.914
And I will make it worth your while.

34:36.007 --> 34:39.079
No, the wedding's not canceled, okay?
Just give us the flowers, please?

34:39.177 --> 34:40.746
Shit, that was the gardens.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.254
It's busy.

34:45.583 --> 34:49.259
I guess there's just no stopping
the hand of fate, is there?

34:51.056 --> 34:53.400
Well, thank you for being so kind.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.402
Thank you, bye.

35:07.272 --> 35:10.185
Hi. I need to cancel
a service for a limousine.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.019
Nice shot.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.184
You're proud, aren't you?

35:18.316 --> 35:20.296
Shit, it's Michael.

35:20.385 --> 35:22.092
Well, answer the phone.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.369
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.596
<i>What's up?</i>

35:27.692 --> 35:29.603
You sound stressed.

35:29.694 --> 35:32.265
<i>I've just been on the phone all day.</i>

35:32.364 --> 35:35.072
Well, don't you worry
because, in a couple of days,

35:35.167 --> 35:37.408
we're going to be a million miles away.

35:37.502 --> 35:40.210
Thank God.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.443
So...

35:41.540 --> 35:43.019
<i>Where are you?</i>

35:44.242 --> 35:46.085
I'm just... I'm with Deb.

35:46.178 --> 35:49.819
We're actually on our way
over to the gardens right now.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.451
<i>Why is that?</i>

35:52.918 --> 35:55.694
Just wanna make sure everything's perfect.

35:55.787 --> 35:59.257
Well, I cannot wait to get you
all alone on an island.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.270
Mikey! You're up!

36:02.360 --> 36:06.634
Right. All right, so, couple of hours,
I'm gonna stop by the hotel,

36:06.731 --> 36:10.945
make sure everything at the suite is
perfect for when your folks arrive.

36:11.036 --> 36:13.277
Okay. I love you.

36:13.371 --> 36:16.650
I love you too. I'll see you tonight.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.950
It's okay, we can play in the dark.
No big deal.

36:22.047 --> 36:25.190
- I brought the glow-in-the-dark balls.
- You brought the glowing balls?

36:25.283 --> 36:26.353
All right.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.494
You all right?

36:46.805 --> 36:48.113
Hi.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.184
Miss Bloom.

36:49.274 --> 36:52.689
I've been trying to reach you
for the last, like, hour.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.518
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:57.015 --> 36:58.551
- Did I?
- Yeah.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.096
I hope I didn't cause you any distress.

37:01.186 --> 37:03.359
The garden... you didn't give it away,
did you?

37:03.455 --> 37:06.368
No. I was just getting ready
to call you back.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.869
Great.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.303
The man on the phone...

37:10.395 --> 37:13.069
sounded a bit... peculiar.

37:26.211 --> 37:28.020
Anything else I can get you?

37:28.113 --> 37:29.251
No.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.700
Hey, give me one of those.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.441
You quit.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.344
Just give me one.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.489
What do you know about this guy?

38:02.547 --> 38:03.651
He's psychotic.

38:06.718 --> 38:07.856
Yeah, but...

38:09.120 --> 38:12.129
Do you know his last name
or where he's from or anything?

38:12.223 --> 38:15.432
No. We didn't exactly do a lot of talking.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.432
Well, what do you remember?

38:20.932 --> 38:22.036
Why?

38:23.501 --> 38:24.809
I know a private eye.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.712
He's an ex-cop.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.313
I think you should look into this guy.

38:32.544 --> 38:36.351
Look, I know he's crazy,
but do you really think that's necessary?

38:37.716 --> 38:39.320
Yeah.

38:39.417 --> 38:40.794
You don't know how crazy he is.

38:40.885 --> 38:42.125
I mean...

38:42.220 --> 38:44.131
Is he violent? Is he dangerous?

38:44.222 --> 38:46.566
Has he done this kind of shit before?

38:50.061 --> 38:51.699
You know?

39:00.638 --> 39:02.413
All right.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.113
But I don't want anybody
to know about this,

39:05.210 --> 39:06.848
and I don't want Patrick to find out

39:06.945 --> 39:09.016
because he'll probably take it
as some kind of encouragement.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.352
No, you don't have to worry.
Clay is completely discreet.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.671
Hey. Hey, it's Deb.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.501
I've got somebody I want you to look into.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.623
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.649
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

40:17.749 --> 40:18.784
Good.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.498
Clay, Tara. Tara, Clay.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.657
Miss Bloom. It's a pleasure.

40:23.755 --> 40:24.927
Hi.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.060
You sure know how to pick them.

40:27.158 --> 40:30.736
His name is Patrick Flynn, a real loon.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.366
Did a little digging,
pulled up quite a file on him.

40:35.700 --> 40:38.647
Been in and out of state custody
most of his life.

40:38.736 --> 40:42.548
Shrink said he was obsessive-compulsive,

40:42.640 --> 40:46.144
with paranoid delusions and rage issues.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.225
It's a total blueprint
for a psycho stalker.

40:49.314 --> 40:50.554
And get this...

40:50.648 --> 40:54.494
it seems young Patrick had quite
the crush on his babysitter.

40:54.586 --> 40:57.226
Or maybe it was
a little more than a crush.

40:57.322 --> 40:58.767
Hey, Patrick.

41:01.659 --> 41:03.536
Thank you.

41:03.628 --> 41:07.576
<i>Oddly enough, the babysitter
didn't feel the same way,</i>

41:07.665 --> 41:10.509
<i>and the little psycho
didn't exactly take it well.</i>

41:17.208 --> 41:18.414
Come on, Patrick!

41:18.510 --> 41:20.820
Get out! Patrick, get out!

41:20.912 --> 41:22.550
Go!

41:22.647 --> 41:27.588
The babysitter saved his life but
died a few days later from the burns.

41:28.753 --> 41:30.357
Jesus.

41:30.455 --> 41:33.129
I'd say he has a type, wouldn't you?

41:35.093 --> 41:38.506
He's got a half-dozen
restraining orders against him.

41:38.596 --> 41:40.473
Spent a couple stints in rehab,

41:40.565 --> 41:44.103
and most recently,
the Louisiana State Correctional System.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.476
What did he do?

41:45.570 --> 41:49.084
He stalked a nurse at the rehab because
he thought she was some kind of angel

41:49.173 --> 41:50.948
or some shit, thought she'd save him.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.065
Somebody, please help!

42:09.160 --> 42:10.468
Someone, help me!

42:10.562 --> 42:12.564
Help me! Help me!

42:12.664 --> 42:13.608
Someone!

42:14.899 --> 42:16.242
<i>Help me!</i>

42:30.848 --> 42:33.124
<i>He set the car on fire with her in it?</i>

42:33.217 --> 42:34.560
<i>They let him walk.</i>

42:34.652 --> 42:36.598
<i>Didn't have enough to build a case.</i>

42:36.688 --> 42:39.168
Now, you can file a restraining order.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.100
Won't really help.

42:41.192 --> 42:44.696
Most stalkers are long gone
by the time the police arrive.

42:44.796 --> 42:48.539
A creep like this won't stop
unless... you make him stop.

42:48.633 --> 42:50.670
You know he's going to show up again.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.707
What are we going to do when he does?

42:53.805 --> 42:55.512
You aren't going to do anything.

42:55.607 --> 42:57.848
Let me handle this prick.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.621
Yeah.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.090
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.251
Let's do it.

43:04.349 --> 43:05.589
Okay.

44:44.816 --> 44:47.729
Whoa... I'm sorry.

44:47.819 --> 44:49.196
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

44:49.287 --> 44:50.994
- I didn't see you there.
- Yeah.

44:51.089 --> 44:52.227
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

44:52.323 --> 44:54.462
- Yeah, I think so.
- I didn't see you either.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.677
It's fascinating.

45:08.106 --> 45:09.414
Do you mind if I walk with you?

45:09.507 --> 45:10.986
Yeah, sure.

45:19.117 --> 45:20.994
Do you ride?

45:22.253 --> 45:23.960
No, not yet.

45:25.623 --> 45:27.432
I've been waiting for the right time.

45:28.993 --> 45:30.472
Maybe that's now.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.336
Could you point me in the right direction?

45:35.433 --> 45:38.107
You just book a riding lesson,

45:38.202 --> 45:39.977
go for a ride.

45:42.473 --> 45:44.475
He's a beauty.

45:44.575 --> 45:45.747
Is he yours?

45:45.843 --> 45:47.254
Yeah.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.556
You think I could...

45:51.649 --> 45:53.026
take a picture?

45:53.117 --> 45:54.357
Sure, I guess.

45:54.452 --> 45:56.227
- Both of you?
- Yeah.

46:01.993 --> 46:03.063
Good.

46:03.161 --> 46:04.469
Perfect.

46:08.833 --> 46:09.937
I'm Patrick.

46:10.034 --> 46:11.308
Emily.

46:12.870 --> 46:15.043
So, have you been riding a long time?

46:15.139 --> 46:17.050
Yeah, since I was little.

46:18.676 --> 46:20.451
Does anyone else in your family ride?

46:20.545 --> 46:21.819
No, just me.

46:23.414 --> 46:24.916
You have siblings?

46:25.016 --> 46:26.893
Yeah, I have two sisters.

46:26.984 --> 46:28.327
What's their names?

46:28.419 --> 46:30.092
Annie and Tara.

46:30.188 --> 46:31.531
They don't ride though.

46:32.890 --> 46:34.392
Tara...

46:35.526 --> 46:37.597
that's a...

46:37.695 --> 46:39.265
That's a beautiful name.

46:40.331 --> 46:41.605
I know a Tara.

46:41.699 --> 46:44.407
What's she like?

46:44.502 --> 46:47.711
You ask a lot of questions.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.012
I do, don't I?

46:50.107 --> 46:51.347
Let me take him from here.

46:51.442 --> 46:52.716
Thank you.

47:01.586 --> 47:03.122
You know, I have to get going.

47:03.221 --> 47:05.030
I'm meeting my parents.

47:07.191 --> 47:09.137
Well, I don't want to keep you.

47:10.428 --> 47:12.635
It was nice to meet you.

47:12.730 --> 47:14.471
You too.

47:14.565 --> 47:17.205
I'm sure we'll talk again.

47:17.301 --> 47:18.905
Soon.

48:53.331 --> 48:55.675
Excuse me?

48:55.766 --> 48:57.302
Could I have a notepad?

48:57.401 --> 48:59.005
Sure.

49:03.441 --> 49:05.011
Can I have two?

49:07.878 --> 49:09.357
Yes, sir.

49:10.648 --> 49:12.127
Why don't you take three?

49:12.216 --> 49:14.025
Thank you.

49:14.118 --> 49:16.189
Are you a member of the wedding party?

49:17.655 --> 49:21.563
You don't have to wait for Michael.
I can book you into your room if you like.

49:21.659 --> 49:24.265
No, thanks. I'll wait.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.446
Hi.

50:11.976 --> 50:14.820
I knew we'd see each other again.

50:14.912 --> 50:16.983
Honestly, you did not have to go
out of your way for us.

50:17.081 --> 50:19.220
Yeah. You are going to let me pay
for all this, right?

50:19.316 --> 50:22.854
Nonsense, the least I could do
is spoil my family.

50:22.953 --> 50:24.091
Family to be.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.166
Family to be.

50:25.256 --> 50:29.594
It's really nice to see you again,
but we were actually just leaving

50:29.693 --> 50:32.833
because my parents are checking in, so.

50:32.930 --> 50:34.238
Maybe I'll see you around.

50:35.499 --> 50:36.705
Who is that?

50:36.801 --> 50:38.075
I met him at the stables.

50:38.169 --> 50:40.115
- He's sexy.
- I know, right?

50:42.440 --> 50:45.319
Will you make sure their luggage makes it
to the rooftop suite, please?

50:45.409 --> 50:47.411
Oh, my God! The rooftop suite?

50:47.511 --> 50:48.785
This place is awesome.

50:48.879 --> 50:51.689
I am totally going to live
in a place like this...

50:53.084 --> 50:55.621
Where is my eldest?

50:55.719 --> 50:57.062
Has Tara gotten here yet?

50:57.154 --> 50:58.462
No, so...

50:58.556 --> 51:00.126
Michael?

51:01.592 --> 51:03.594
It's nice to finally meet you.

51:03.694 --> 51:07.437
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
you have me at a disadvantage.

51:07.531 --> 51:10.671
Patrick. Patrick Flynn.

51:10.768 --> 51:13.009
- Right.
- Tara hasn't mentioned me?

51:13.104 --> 51:14.742
Michael, would you mind if we head up?

51:14.839 --> 51:17.410
Sure. Let's make sure they get
to their room and everything's good.

51:17.508 --> 51:18.543
- Great, thanks.
- All right.

51:18.642 --> 51:20.121
I'll see you guys in a little bit.
One second.

51:20.211 --> 51:21.349
Thank you.

51:24.281 --> 51:27.888
Now, I'm sorry. What was this about Tara?

51:27.985 --> 51:29.794
The wedding, it's still going on?

51:31.122 --> 51:32.658
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?

51:33.991 --> 51:35.561
There's no problems?

51:37.661 --> 51:39.504
Why don't we go talk in private?

51:45.002 --> 51:46.913
All right.

51:47.004 --> 51:49.109
What exactly is this about?

51:51.542 --> 51:54.785
I don't think you know your fiancé
as well as you think you do.

51:56.514 --> 51:58.187
And why is that?

52:02.019 --> 52:04.226
You should ask Tara about me.

52:06.390 --> 52:07.391
I get it.

52:07.491 --> 52:11.967
You're some douchebag ex-boyfriend
here to rile me up.

52:12.062 --> 52:13.939
But guess what?

52:14.031 --> 52:16.375
Nothing is going to upset me

52:16.467 --> 52:18.469
before my wedding.

52:18.569 --> 52:20.606
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

52:20.704 --> 52:23.150
Nothing is going to upset you.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.742
Nothing.

52:27.478 --> 52:29.287
Well, you should ask Tara about me.

52:29.380 --> 52:30.984
Fuck you.

52:31.081 --> 52:32.719
Michael!

52:37.221 --> 52:40.031
I cannot believe you are
going to marry our Tara!

52:40.124 --> 52:41.159
Justine, I...

52:41.258 --> 52:42.828
Give me one second, okay?

52:52.236 --> 52:53.772
Hey.

52:53.871 --> 52:55.612
- Hey.
- Wow.

52:55.706 --> 52:57.845
You're a sight for sore eyes.

52:57.942 --> 53:00.183
Did you have a long day?

53:00.277 --> 53:02.518
You have no idea.

53:06.317 --> 53:09.764
Well, your folks are in the suite,
and your crazy girlfriend just showed up,

53:09.853 --> 53:12.197
so we should not keep them waiting.

53:12.289 --> 53:15.270
Is it too late to run away together?

53:15.359 --> 53:17.396
Yeah, let's go join the party.

53:17.494 --> 53:19.474
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay. All right.

53:25.469 --> 53:28.143
So...

53:28.239 --> 53:31.812
Why this rush job, huh?

53:31.909 --> 53:33.889
I have a very big day tomorrow.

53:35.346 --> 53:38.054
You are trying to impress a lady, no?

53:38.148 --> 53:39.752
Is it that obvious?

53:39.850 --> 53:44.695
Well, in my business, one sees
a lot of that sort of thing, no?

53:44.788 --> 53:46.461
You're done.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.572
She must be quite some lady.

53:54.598 --> 53:56.100
You have no idea.

54:10.214 --> 54:11.625
Come on, guys. Can we get the picture?

54:11.715 --> 54:13.194
Yes.

54:27.464 --> 54:28.943
What is this?

54:31.035 --> 54:32.810
Wait. How did you get that picture?

54:32.903 --> 54:35.406
You have to stay away from him.

54:35.506 --> 54:38.146
- Why?
- Because I said so.

54:39.677 --> 54:41.884
Oh, my God. I get it.

54:41.979 --> 54:43.424
You're the Tara that Patrick knows.

54:43.514 --> 54:45.221
That's why he's here.

54:45.316 --> 54:46.795
- What?
- He's here.

54:46.884 --> 54:49.228
He's here at the hotel.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.526
Emily, listen to me.

54:50.621 --> 54:52.396
I need you to stay away from him, okay?

54:52.489 --> 54:55.865
Really? You're the one getting married,
and I can't talk to a cute older guy?

54:55.959 --> 54:58.872
- You don't understand.
- Oh, yeah, I understand.

54:58.962 --> 55:00.532
You want all the attention for yourself.

55:00.631 --> 55:02.804
Emily, please. Not now.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.880
Okay, fine.

56:47.604 --> 56:49.550
Is that for me?

56:55.212 --> 56:57.021
Who else would it be for?

56:58.015 --> 56:59.995
Can I read it?

57:01.452 --> 57:02.897
When I'm done.

57:04.555 --> 57:06.796
I wanna read it now.

57:08.926 --> 57:11.406
When I'm done,

57:11.495 --> 57:14.032
you'll know how much I love you.

57:45.162 --> 57:46.766
You're so lucky.

57:46.864 --> 57:49.140
Yeah, Michael's awesome.

57:49.233 --> 57:50.541
And hot.

58:01.545 --> 58:03.855
Excuse me, everyone.

58:03.947 --> 58:05.824
I know we're supposed to be...

58:05.916 --> 58:08.988
saving the toast for the reception,

58:09.086 --> 58:13.033
but I want to take this moment to
officially welcome Michael into the family.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.446
I'm sorry that your own parents
can't be with us.

58:29.306 --> 58:32.310
But I know they'd be really proud of you
and all your accomplishments.

58:32.409 --> 58:33.353
Thank you, Jack.

58:36.346 --> 58:37.654
To Michael.

58:42.252 --> 58:45.893
No one could love our daughter
any more than you.

58:45.989 --> 58:47.366
Cheers.

59:00.003 --> 59:01.573
All right.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.419
Thank you so much for taking care
of my parents like that.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:16.389
Well, they are my parents, too.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.188
This is the last time I'm going to see you
before the wedding.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.896
I know, gosh.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.560
That reminds me, I need to write my vows.

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:29.797
You haven't done that yet?

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:32.373
Well, I've been thinking about it a lot.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.941
Come here.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:37.809
Good night.

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:39.244
Babe?

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:40.474
Yeah?

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.279
Nothing.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.718
Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.084
Forget it.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:50.454
- Done.
- Okay.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:52.185
I love you.

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:53.659
Love you too.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:04.321
There you go.

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:06.655
Thank you so much.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:09.659
It's so beautiful.

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:11.460
I can't wait.

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:13.592
You are going to look fantastic in it.

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:15.294
Thank you.

01:03:24.868 --> 01:03:28.077
Make sure you send me a photo,
so I can put it up at the shop.

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.343
I will, I promise.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:36.255
See you later.

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.567
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.071
What are you doing here?

01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:56.473
Well, there was just...

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.773
something that I wanted
to talk to you about.

01:03:58.869 --> 01:03:59.904
Okay?

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:02.244
I didn't wanna bring it up
last night, but...

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:05.882
What is it?

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.223
That the wedding dress, huh?

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.793
Yeah.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:19.928
You know what? It's nothing.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.833
Really, I mean, I shouldn't...

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:24.564
Michael, wait.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.642
There's something you should know.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.513
And... I don't know how to...

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:33.706
Don't.

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:36.875
Just don't.

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:40.477
I've done some things
that I'm not proud of,

01:04:40.577 --> 01:04:43.217
and if you have too,

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:45.520
it doesn't matter.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.424
This matters.

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:51.494
Tomorrow...

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:54.426
Tomorrow's a new day

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:57.664
and a clean slate, all right?

01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.672
Okay.

01:04:59.763 --> 01:05:01.333
Come here.

01:05:08.305 --> 01:05:09.807
I love you.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.317
I love you.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.382
All right.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.473
<i>Tomorrow's the big day.</i>

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:21.366
Champagne?

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.277
How do I look?

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.582
- Gorgeous.
- You look beautiful.

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:36.856
Are you ready?

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.527
Yes.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.618
Okay, I'm gonna let everybody know.

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:43.823
Okay.

01:08:52.028 --> 01:08:53.837
Hello.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:57.069
You two are just as beautiful
as the bride.

01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:01.174
I was surprised to see you
the other night in the lobby.

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:04.685
I'm just 14.

01:09:04.774 --> 01:09:06.617
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:11.223
So, how do you know Tara?

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.760
We're close.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:17.319
That's really weird because she's
never mentioned you until last night.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:21.035
Hey, we're gonna start soon.

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:22.330
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:24.734
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.544
Hey, everybody, we're gonna start soon,

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:34.410
if you guys want to go ahead
and take your seats.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.984
We're gonna start if you guys
want to head over to your seats.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:40.145
So, how did you meet Tara?

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:41.483
Well, it's funny you should ask.

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:43.182
- I'd like to just...
- Patrick, hey!

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.849
I'm so glad you could make it.

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:47.554
You guys don't mind if I borrow him
for a second, do you?

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:49.425
Tara wants to talk to you.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:54.997
So you know? About us?

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:56.627
Yeah, she told me everything.

01:09:57.961 --> 01:09:59.372
So she's finally accepting.

01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:03.106
- Well, we're meant to be.
- Yeah.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.872
You know, I know something else, too.

01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:06.879
Your babysitter's
not gonna save you this time.

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:11.381
Fuck him up.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:35.439
Friends and family,
we are gathered here today

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:39.035
not to witness a beginning
of what will be,

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:41.172
because it already is.

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:48.220
Just help celebrate
with Tara and Michael...

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.589
the wondrous and joyful feelings

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:55.685
that they have in their hearts
for one another.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:58.026
You may now kiss the bride.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.413
Easy there, cutie. Here.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:35.327
- I can carry you. Whoa. You okay?
- I'm fine. Keep your paws to yourself.

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:36.419
I'm going to bed.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:37.691
Okay, have a good night.

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:38.822
You too.

01:12:57.907 --> 01:12:59.853
I have a few questions for you.

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:00.947
No!

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:12.261
Thanks, Deb.

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:15.427
For letting me use your place.

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.308
I got everything I need.

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.680
You want a chip?

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:03.643
So, how is everything?

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.150
It's wonderful.

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:06.311
Everything is fantastic.

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:08.013
That's good.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.885
Is there anything else I can get for you?

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:12.084
No, I think...

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.683
I think we should be good for the night.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:14.989
Good, good.

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:17.860
We've had a few cancellations,

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:20.628
so I'll send the rest of the staff
home for the night.

01:14:20.723 --> 01:14:22.066
Besides me,

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:25.162
you have the entire place to yourselves.

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:27.707
- All right.
- You two enjoy your evening.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:31.176
We will have some fresh food
set out for you after sunrise.

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:32.575
Thank you.

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:35.046
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.741
Alone.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:10.183
<i>This is Monica Lady Ace.</i>

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.776
<i>Here are details for broadcast times</i>

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:16.084
<i>for our marine weather forecast bulletin.</i>

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:30.869
Not again.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.175
What the fuck?

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:33.625
So, can you finally relax?

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:35.202
Yes.

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:38.336
Good.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.879
I'm thinking that we just stay here.

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.744
- Forever?
- Forever.

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:50.943
- And ever.
- And ever.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.383
And ever.

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:58.086
Oh, no.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.352
No.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.450
That's not good.

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:02.927
All right.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:04.225
I'm gonna grab some wine.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.358
- Okay.
- Do you need anything from the...

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.129
Can you bring my sweater?

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:10.363
Yes.

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:18.006
All right.

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.927
You!

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.291
Oh, God!

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:30.708
It fits.

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.095
Thank you.

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.342
Isn't it just so beautiful here?

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:03.808
Let's never leave.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.614
Michael! Michael!

01:20:07.703 --> 01:20:09.341
Hey...

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:16.784
Where's my husband?

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:19.757
I'm right here.

01:20:22.918 --> 01:20:24.591
You're fucking crazy.

01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:30.200
Don't be like that.

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.703
Come on.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.066
You're sick.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:43.716
You... hurt me.

01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:50.415
Michael's gone.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.921
You should have saved me.

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.764
That's all I needed.

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.101
Please, Patrick.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:07.435
Don't.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.270
Please.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:10.605
Please.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:13.903
Please.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.584
- You brought this on yourself.
- No!

01:21:32.021 --> 01:21:32.965
Oh, my God.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:34.329
Michael.

01:21:34.423 --> 01:21:36.528
It was... him.

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:38.937
Oh, my God.

01:21:39.028 --> 01:21:40.530
Come here. Come here.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:47.638
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:50.707
I'm sorry.

01:21:50.806 --> 01:21:52.217
I'm sorry.

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:55.547
Honey, I need you to get up.

01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:56.987
Get up. Michael, get up.

01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:58.490
Please.

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:06.628
No, no! No!

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:11.233
I've got... I've got you.

01:22:20.069 --> 01:22:21.139
Come on. Come on.

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:22.977
Come on.

01:22:40.556 --> 01:22:41.557
No.

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:43.928
Michael.

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:50.735
You have to go get help.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:52.073
No, I'm not leaving you.

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.306
You have to. You have to go.

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:56.076
No. If I leave, he'll kill you.

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:58.310
He's gonna kill us both.

01:22:58.407 --> 01:23:01.047
Please, I can't let you die.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:03.214
- So just... go.
- No.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:04.450
Go.

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.523
Tara?

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:16.028
Sweetheart?

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:23.033
Come on, honey.

01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:27.514
Let's talk.

01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:25.137
I almost feel sorry for you.

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:34.169
But you can't stop the hand of fate.

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:41.049
Where's our girl now?

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.895
Till death do you part, huh?

01:24:49.952 --> 01:24:52.523
- You ready?
- Are you?

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:21.518
I'm so sorry.

01:26:25.981 --> 01:26:27.824
I was just looking for you.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.732
You really should be in bed, resting.

01:26:33.822 --> 01:26:35.199
I'm fine.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.599
How is he?

01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:40.640
Your husband's coming along.

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:42.436
He lost a lot of blood, but...

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:43.976
he should be just fine.

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:48.946
The two of you are really very lucky.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.846
And in your condition...

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:53.913
Condition?

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.479
You don't know?

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.184
You're pregnant.

01:27:00.082 --> 01:27:01.584
Congratulations.
