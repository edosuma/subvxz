simultaneously

24:33.139 --> 24:36.225
If you'd like to educate
yourself further, Mr. Gavin,

24:36.225 --> 24:37.685
there's a good analysis
on the topic

24:37.685 --> 24:39.145
by Bree and Colton.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.359

24:52.200 --> 24:55.828

for every possibility,

24:55.828 --> 24:58.206
and you will never act.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.499
It is nobler to have courage

25:00.499 --> 25:02.919
as we stumble into half
the things we fear

25:02.919 --> 25:05.630

every possible obstacle

25:05.630 --> 25:07.715

25:09.258 --> 25:13.596
Great things are achieved
by embracing great dangers.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.266
These were the words of Xerxes,

25:17.266 --> 25:19.352

25:19.352 --> 25:22.104

in Old Persian.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.689

25:23.689 --> 25:26.734
History has borne out
Xerxes' wisdom.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.028
The tactics of the battlefield
have changed

25:29.028 --> 25:31.364
with the invention
of the stirrup,

25:31.364 --> 25:33.199
the machine gun, the airplane,

25:33.199 --> 25:34.867
the Epstein drive.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.536
Political and economic worlds
changed

25:37.536 --> 25:40.206
when the Europeans
colonized the New World

25:40.206 --> 25:43.668
and when Mars
declared its independence

25:43.668 --> 25:46.462
and now, again,

25:46.462 --> 25:48.631
with the opening
of the Ring Gates.

25:50.007 --> 25:52.760
Every new invention
or discovery

25:52.760 --> 25:56.889
alters the strategic
and tactical landscape.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.267
The doctrine of grand strategy

25:59.267 --> 26:02.103
is the way in which
we face these changes

26:02.103 --> 26:05.231
without losing sight
of our purpose,

26:05.231 --> 26:07.942
how we adapt to the new reality

26:07.942 --> 26:09.777
and remain faithful

26:09.777 --> 26:12.697
to our overarching goals.

26:12.697 --> 26:15.032
In these lectures
and workshops,

26:15.032 --> 26:17.368
we have considered
the Ring Space

26:17.368 --> 26:20.830
as a radical alteration
of the tactical, economic,

26:20.830 --> 26:23.624
and strategic landscapes,

26:23.624 --> 26:26.168
and I hope we have given
each of you

26:26.168 --> 26:28.004
the insights

26:28.004 --> 26:29.880
to carry the dream of Mars

26:29.880 --> 26:35.052
from being a planet circling
a lonely, single sun

26:35.052 --> 26:37.346
to a vision of humanity

26:37.346 --> 26:40.641

a thousand stars.
