WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:01.960
<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"...</i>

00:01.970 --> 00:03.840
You took home someone else's baby

00:03.850 --> 00:05.770
and another family took home yours.

00:05.780 --> 00:07.660
The hospital wants this to go away quietly.

00:07.670 --> 00:08.550
Pointing the finger at how

00:08.560 --> 00:11.140
the other kid was raised always
turns into a bloodbath.

00:11.150 --> 00:13.600
- Guys, this is Daphne.
- There was this deaf kid in our school.

00:13.610 --> 00:16.239
He used to talk like: hello, my name is...

00:16.250 --> 00:17.390
I need a lookout.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.460
This is the strangest first
date I've ever been on.

00:19.470 --> 00:20.540
Come here

00:21.945 --> 00:25.099
- Why do you hate them so much?
- They're arrogant and entitled.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.355
I do not like the way she talked to us.
I do not like her temper.

00:28.455 --> 00:30.155
So who do you think my dad is?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:39.268 --> 00:40.821
- Curse you!
- Get back! Get back!

00:42.158 --> 00:43.158
Yeah!

01:00.479 --> 01:01.479
Toby.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.550
So, uh, F.Y.I.,

01:08.560 --> 01:10.520
I'm the switched girl who can hear,

01:10.540 --> 01:11.760
and if you guys could either make

01:11.770 --> 01:14.290
your shots or miss somewhere
other than my wall,

01:14.720 --> 01:16.900
that would be great. I'd appreciate it.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.700
I'm really sorry. I didn't realize.

01:18.710 --> 01:21.380
Daphne, it's okay.
That's just Bay being Bay.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.560
- What does that mean?
- I think it's a euphemism

01:23.570 --> 01:25.200
for another word that starts with "B."

01:25.210 --> 01:28.710
- Toby.
- Don't worry, dad,
that's just Toby being Toby.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.250
Yeah well, it's Toby being Carmelo Anthony.

01:34.090 --> 01:35.140
Here we go, here we go.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.610
Point... haaa! Now listen to me.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.550
You're short-arming it and
you want to extend your elbow.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.580
Make sure the thumb on

01:41.590 --> 01:43.650
your guide hand is pointed at your forehead.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
Hoo-yeah.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.890
That's what I'm talking about! Nice!

01:51.310 --> 01:52.620
One more, one more.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.300
- Oh hi, Gillian.
- Hi!

01:56.430 --> 01:57.370
As soon as I heard you

01:57.380 --> 01:59.480
were running the fundraiser,
I had to stop by.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.580
I have been meaning to donate this.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.460
- Thank you.
- How's the planning going?

02:04.670 --> 02:07.160
I know Denise set the bar so high.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.880
That medieval theme was so original.

02:09.889 --> 02:12.040
Yeah, but the jousting
got a little out of hand.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.150
Oh!

02:15.670 --> 02:17.940
Oh, is your new maid a live-in?

02:18.330 --> 02:21.230
That explains the car pulling in
and out of your driveway lately.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.920
No no, she's not a maid.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.010
- Who is she?
- Yeah, mom, who is she?

02:33.700 --> 02:35.320
Dunk! Ahhhh!

02:37.260 --> 02:38.520
- Hoo-yeah, up!
- Guys!

02:39.870 --> 02:41.560
Guys, hey!

02:42.760 --> 02:46.450
Hey, sorry, we need to decide
what we're going to tell people

02:46.460 --> 02:49.550
about our... situation.

02:49.710 --> 02:53.130
- Our situation?
- Yeah, you guys living here.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.340
Some of mom's friends are getting curious.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.810
Crazy idea... we could tell everybody

02:59.820 --> 03:01.250
our daughters were switched at birth

03:01.260 --> 03:03.060
and this seemed like
a good way to get to know them.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.970
I just don't want other people weighing in

03:05.970 --> 03:08.350
while we're still figuring things out.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.790
How about dad's a polygamist and
you and Regina are sister-wives?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.460
Witness protection... Daphne saw a mob hit?

03:13.470 --> 03:14.640
A white slavery ring.

03:14.650 --> 03:17.380
Black-market organ deal...
Regina's selling mom a kidney.

03:17.390 --> 03:19.370
Okay, I get it. You guys think I'm crazy.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.860
So let's just go with
a vague version of the truth.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.860
Daphne and Regina are old friends,

03:26.870 --> 03:30.150
and they're just staying here until they...

03:30.950 --> 03:32.520
relocate.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.190
How does that sound?
Is that okay with everybody?

03:35.200 --> 03:36.550
- Yeah, it sounds good to me.
- It sounds brilliant.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.180
Perfectly vague.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.280
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.830
They're kind of allergic to the truth.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.070
Ah, it seems like a lot of work

03:50.080 --> 03:51.970
always worrying about
what everybody's thinking.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.970
But, you know, to each his own.

03:53.980 --> 03:57.210
Hey, so speaking of the truth...

03:58.900 --> 04:00.180
Who's my father?

04:01.480 --> 04:04.260
Oh wow.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.370
Yeah, I've been kind of

04:06.380 --> 04:08.640
wondering about that half of the equation.

04:11.030 --> 04:12.990
It's a guy who took off
when Daphne was little

04:13.000 --> 04:14.930
and hasn't been in touch since.

04:14.940 --> 04:16.860
That's it? That's all you could tell me?

04:19.320 --> 04:20.540
You want the truth?

04:21.070 --> 04:23.550
The best thing that man ever did was leave.

04:24.726 --> 04:28.098
Our lives are better for it.
And so is yours.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.210
Hey, fried zucchini?

05:28.430 --> 05:30.220
No lunch is complete without them.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.480
Your dad's restaurant delivers. Who knew?

05:33.510 --> 05:35.330
Yeah, we also have a mobile truck

05:35.340 --> 05:36.960
and I'll be manning
the kitchen friday night.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.270
You'll have to come check it out.

05:39.150 --> 05:41.590
We'll be serving our famous popcorn shrimp.

05:42.830 --> 05:44.270
I think I'm gonna pass.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.970
Oh, you're not a big shrimp fan?

05:47.820 --> 05:49.520
I'm not really a fan of hanging with a guy

05:49.530 --> 05:52.200
who doesn't defend me
when his friends try to humiliate me.

05:52.350 --> 05:55.590
Well, I wasn't sure if you were mad...
I mean you just kinda left.

05:55.610 --> 05:58.240
- 'Cause I was mad.
- Well, I just...

05:58.340 --> 06:01.240
I froze, you know?
I didn't want to say the wrong thing.

06:01.290 --> 06:03.620
So not saying anything
seemed like the right choice?

06:03.630 --> 06:06.770
- I didn't know what you wanted me to do.
- Exactly.

06:07.260 --> 06:08.670
Thanks for the zucchini.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.609
If you see a short latina woman
with gray roots and a map

06:19.709 --> 06:22.010
wandering around the neighbourhood
could you send her my way?

06:22.020 --> 06:23.360
Are you having a friend stop by?

06:23.410 --> 06:25.620
Oh, she's too irritating
to count as a friend.

06:25.630 --> 06:28.680
- She's a client.
- You're doing hair here?

06:28.690 --> 06:32.410
I did hair at my old place
and when I moved here so did my business.

06:32.420 --> 06:36.080
Although three busses and a 45 min
commute is not making it easy.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.360
So you're operating a salon right here

06:39.370 --> 06:41.830
with clients from your old neighborhood?

06:42.080 --> 06:44.040
That's right. And feel free to stop by

06:44.050 --> 06:45.910
if you ever want to do
something about those bangs.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.920
I love this place. It's so...

07:00.020 --> 07:01.020
authentic.

07:01.359 --> 07:03.901
That's what rich people say when a place is rundown.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.280
You know what I mean. It just...

07:07.490 --> 07:11.810
It feels real. Like, real people come here.

07:11.820 --> 07:12.760
Hmmm.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.380
Are those people from the neighborhood?

07:17.910 --> 07:19.890
Yeah. Yeah, that's us.

07:27.930 --> 07:29.990
Did you ever meet Daphne's dad?

07:30.020 --> 07:33.200
Uh, I mean my dad?

07:33.210 --> 07:35.430
No, he took off before I moved in.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.710
So Daphne's never even mentioned him.

07:38.810 --> 07:40.714
No, I mean, it kinda
seemed like a sore subject.

07:40.814 --> 07:42.526
You know, if this whole thing
hadn't happened

07:42.626 --> 07:45.530
there'd probably be like
17 pictures of me on that wall.

07:45.950 --> 07:48.680
Really. I'd have my own table,
they'd know my order...

07:49.510 --> 07:51.900
They know everyone's order.
They only serve tacos.

07:51.910 --> 07:52.960
Indulge me. I'm trying to

07:52.970 --> 07:55.200
figure out what my life
could have been like,

07:56.080 --> 07:57.670
who I might have been.

07:58.150 --> 08:01.200
Hmm, well, you'd probably
still be a pain in the ass.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.330
Oh, thank you. You're so sweet.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.090
Does anybody on this team know how to pass?

08:27.720 --> 08:28.980
I mean, seriously?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.039
I have not seen a pass since
I walked in the building.

08:33.110 --> 08:35.929
- Who's the coach?
- That would be Melody.

08:39.020 --> 08:42.789
Hi. Would you tell her
Daphne's open at the low post

08:42.799 --> 08:43.679
and her point guard is

08:43.690 --> 08:45.830
launching prayers from the three-point line?

08:49.810 --> 08:53.700
And who are you... besides the pass police?

08:53.770 --> 08:54.820
Uh, I'm, uh...

08:55.490 --> 08:58.310
a friend of Daphne's mom.
They're staying with us.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.220
- Oh, you're a friend of Regina's.
- Yeah.

09:02.230 --> 09:03.750
I've never seen you around.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.720
Oh, we just recently reconnected.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.050
- And they're staying with you?
- Yeah, we, um...

09:11.060 --> 09:13.930
have a guest house and it seemed like a...

09:14.240 --> 09:17.400
I should, um, it's late,
I should probably get going.

09:17.410 --> 09:18.610
It was nice to meet you.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.400
I can't let her leave with just anybody.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.530
Oh, I'm not just anybody. I'm...

09:25.520 --> 09:27.060
You're John Kennish.

09:28.620 --> 09:31.240
You dove into the dugout to catch a pop-up

09:31.370 --> 09:34.640
in the '96 A.L.C.S.
game against the Red Sox.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.170
Eh, you're the baseball fan, all right.

09:39.530 --> 09:42.340
And you're Daphne's biological father.

09:44.190 --> 09:46.190
Uh, yeah. How did you know that?

09:47.970 --> 09:49.620
Regina tells me everything.

09:49.830 --> 09:52.900
Uh-huh, I see. So you let me
just blather on like an idiot

09:52.910 --> 09:54.170
for fun?

09:55.580 --> 09:56.580
Pretty much!

10:01.120 --> 10:04.630
I was just out shopping and
I picked up a few things for Daphne.

10:04.740 --> 10:07.060
- Could I come in?
- Uh, sure.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.320
A few?!

10:13.060 --> 10:15.550
Uh, I've never shopped for her before

10:15.560 --> 10:19.090
so I didn't know what size she was

10:19.100 --> 10:23.180
and whether she liked
solid colors or stripes

10:23.190 --> 10:27.030
or... so I kind of bought everything.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.380
I hope that's okay.

10:32.430 --> 10:35.780
So you're asking my permission

10:36.000 --> 10:38.090
to shower my daughter with clothes

10:38.100 --> 10:40.020
that I could never afford to buy her?

10:41.090 --> 10:42.300
And shoes.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.140
I'm sure she'll love them.

10:51.510 --> 10:52.550
Thank you.

10:55.740 --> 10:57.490
Is there anything else?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.780
Well, I happened to go
by my hair salon today

10:59.790 --> 11:01.890
And Geraldo said he has an open chair.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.380
So I told him about you

11:03.390 --> 11:05.720
and he's really excited to meet you.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.730
Oh, thanks, but I like
working out of my house.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.000
Well, you wouldn't have
to worry about no-shows,

11:12.010 --> 11:14.150
or late clients.
You could cultivate a clientele

11:14.160 --> 11:16.160
right here in Mission Hills.

11:16.540 --> 11:18.240
And they're really big tippers.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.450
Uh, let me think about it.

11:24.050 --> 11:24.990
Okay.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.190
Nice bangs.

11:30.460 --> 11:31.530
Thank you.

11:35.620 --> 11:36.430
Hmmm.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.640
This thing is a piece of crap.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.370
Or as my people say, "Authentic."

11:50.830 --> 11:52.620
Oh, it's getting late.

11:53.270 --> 11:56.320
If I miss my curfew
I'm back under house arrest.

11:56.330 --> 11:58.810
I should probably text my brother.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.710
All right, hang on.

12:05.630 --> 12:06.810
Come on.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.120
I'm sorry.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.350
Hey, you were my guide through
east what-might-have-been.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.440
Don't be sorry.

12:15.950 --> 12:18.710
Well, is there anything else
you want to see while we wait?

12:19.190 --> 12:22.520
There's a laundromat around
the corner that's pretty sketchy.

12:24.830 --> 12:27.240
Yeah! Fine.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.110
- All right.
- Okay.

12:30.470 --> 12:32.830
So what's the deal with

12:32.840 --> 12:35.870
the girl with the braids who never runs?

12:35.880 --> 12:39.400
Oh, that's Heather. My nickname
for her is lazy with an "H."

12:39.400 --> 12:40.810
Oh, lazy with an "H."

12:41.710 --> 12:42.760
I like that.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.650
Is there any way... I mean...

12:46.660 --> 12:49.620
I know that you're really busy,
but would you be able to

12:49.630 --> 12:51.330
come by practice again sometime?

12:51.740 --> 12:53.960
I was thinking the exact same thing.

13:02.170 --> 13:06.600
Okay, so what does this amp do
that your other eight don't?

13:06.700 --> 13:09.010
You know, I just drove halfway
across town to pick you up.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.780
That should buy me a little less judgment.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.960
I'm just saying, doesn't
our lifestyle seem a little excessive?

13:15.070 --> 13:17.630
You know, compared to how real people live?

13:17.640 --> 13:20.350
H.A., why don't you pull out
your smart phone and tweet about

13:20.360 --> 13:22.150
your newfound love of social justice?

13:26.920 --> 13:28.200
That's dad's car.

13:29.030 --> 13:30.430
The only reason he let me

13:30.440 --> 13:32.520
out was 'cause I promised
I could keep curfew.

13:34.660 --> 13:37.330
- I'm so dead.
- Yeah.

13:43.130 --> 13:45.000
So what do you call the short girl

13:45.010 --> 13:47.690
- who elbows everybody?
- Oh, crazy with a "K."

13:47.700 --> 13:49.480
But it has nothing to do with elbowing.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.790
- Hey, guys, how was your night?
- Good.

13:55.930 --> 13:58.260
Toby, need help unloading that amp?

13:58.430 --> 14:00.120
- Sure.
- Good night.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.270
That was easy.

14:05.730 --> 14:06.680
Yeah.

14:07.550 --> 14:09.960
He totally forgot I have a curfew.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.480
Hey.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.870
I hope it was okay that
John picked you up tonight.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.200
That's great. He said he could

14:25.210 --> 14:27.630
do it tomorrow too, if that's okay with you.

14:27.860 --> 14:29.620
Yeah sure.

14:30.530 --> 14:31.480
Homework.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.370
Oh hey, hon, do you still have the results

14:39.380 --> 14:42.120
from that blood test
thing you did at school?

14:42.130 --> 14:43.410
You don't have to double-check.

14:43.420 --> 14:45.510
It's pretty obvious Daphne's your daughter.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.490
No no no, it's for the lawyer.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.130
You need it for my fake I.D. case?

14:49.140 --> 14:51.550
No, we're suing the hospital.

14:52.860 --> 14:54.240
You are? Why?

14:55.240 --> 14:56.468
Well, they made a giant mistake

14:56.568 --> 14:58.440
and they need to be held responsible.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.560
You think getting stuck
with me was a giant mistake?

15:02.670 --> 15:04.680
Sweetie, no, that's not what I'm saying.

15:04.690 --> 15:06.600
What are you suing them for then?

15:06.610 --> 15:08.010
Damages and pain and suffering?

15:08.020 --> 15:10.290
We're trying to teach the hospital a lesson.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.270
Yeah, and the lesson is
"Don't stick me with Bay."

15:14.330 --> 15:16.590
No, Bay, come on. Bay!

15:52.320 --> 15:54.230
- Hey.
- Hey, it's Liam.

15:55.010 --> 15:56.720
It's not like I didn't get the hint,

15:56.730 --> 15:58.620
but I really thing you should
give me one more chance.

15:58.720 --> 15:59.720
Why?

15:59.976 --> 16:02.180
Because I'm really sorry I acted like an idiot

16:02.280 --> 16:03.640
the last time we hung out.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.650
Could you emphasize "Really"?

16:05.810 --> 16:08.210
And I would like to make it up to you.

16:08.220 --> 16:10.250
You know, the interpreter
signs every word you say.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.950
Wait, why didn't you tell me that?

16:12.990 --> 16:14.440
Wait, don't sign that!

16:15.900 --> 16:18.400
You really haven't got
this figured out, have you?

16:18.850 --> 16:21.160
Look, could you just tell her... wait,

16:21.230 --> 16:23.520
don't sign her like I'm talking
to her in the third person

16:23.530 --> 16:26.810
'cause that's rude. Anyway, Daphne,

16:26.820 --> 16:27.970
I know you're mad.

16:29.810 --> 16:33.300
- Never tell a woman she's mad.
- Dude, I got this.

16:33.843 --> 16:34.843
Your funeral.

16:34.963 --> 16:37.720
Should I hang up
while you two figure this out?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.030
No no no no no. I mean,
I know this is kinda weird...

16:40.040 --> 16:40.850
I mean I'm talking to you

16:40.860 --> 16:42.180
through some guy who thinks I'm blowing it,

16:42.190 --> 16:45.010
but I don't want to give up
just 'cause it's kinda hard.

16:45.060 --> 16:47.100
And I don't think that you should either.

16:49.330 --> 16:52.170
I don't think it's too hard.
I'm just not interested.

16:56.740 --> 16:57.680
Wow.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.960
She has tons of experience.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.560
Where were you working most recently?

17:02.610 --> 17:05.211
An exclusive little shop just east of here.

17:05.310 --> 17:06.310
- Hmmm.
- Casa Regina.

17:06.411 --> 17:08.755
I had a station set up at
my house in east Riverside.

17:08.855 --> 17:13.477
- ¿La sala o la cocina?
- La sala, claro, la cocina es para cocinar.

17:14.299 --> 17:17.560
Girl, this chair over here is yours.

17:19.060 --> 17:20.460
Back home I started

17:20.470 --> 17:22.990
in my grandmother's basement in Brixton.

17:23.030 --> 17:25.109
Toughest clients I ever worked on.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.410
- ¿Exigentes?
- Oh, claro que sí.

17:27.510 --> 17:29.780
Kathryn, let me guess.

17:29.790 --> 17:30.840
You're hitting up Geraldo

17:30.850 --> 17:33.490
to donate a cut and blow for the fundraiser.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.860
- I was just about to do that.
- Have you chosen a theme?

17:35.870 --> 17:38.160
I was thinking 1,001 nights,

17:38.170 --> 17:40.060
kind of mysterious and exotic.

17:40.070 --> 17:43.370
Okay, um, that's an interesting choice...

17:43.380 --> 17:46.120
considering everything
that's going on with the middle east.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.440
Well, it's... it's not written in papyrus.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.880
I have to hit up some
more shops for donations,

17:51.890 --> 17:54.100
so I gotta go. Nice to see you.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.640
- you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.700
Gerry! Gerry sweetie,

17:58.740 --> 18:01.700
my curls are beginning to frizz.
We gotta do something.

18:02.150 --> 18:04.910
- Kathryn's friend can probably help you out.
- Oh.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.440
So you and Kathryn, what's the connection?

18:17.470 --> 18:20.310
Oh, um, mommy-and-me group back in the day.

18:20.310 --> 18:23.530
- So your daughters are the same age?
- To the day.

18:23.590 --> 18:26.610
Huh. And you're all staying

18:26.620 --> 18:28.200
in Kathryn's guest house.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.400
Wow, you really have your finger

18:30.410 --> 18:32.630
on the pulse here
in Mission Hills, don't you?

18:32.790 --> 18:35.630
The Kennishes aren't taking
in boarders, are they?

18:35.640 --> 18:39.090
I mean, they're not having
any financial problems?

18:39.330 --> 18:42.690
- Honey, I'm sure you would know if they were.
- Oh, thank god.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.530
Because if Kathryn had to work,
god only knows what she'd do.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.510
I mean, I love the woman...
great energy, but, well,

18:48.980 --> 18:50.560
you know what I'm talking about.

18:52.050 --> 18:55.670
So how long have you two been friends?

18:58.280 --> 19:00.330
Uh, come in.

19:05.490 --> 19:07.100
I said come in!

19:07.690 --> 19:09.940
Hey, I hope I'm not bothering you.

19:09.950 --> 19:11.110
Uh no, what's up?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.700
Your mom got me a few things.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.360
I think some of them were meant for you.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.590
Oh, that explains

19:15.600 --> 19:18.310
the collection of floral
pastel sweaters she gave me.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.310
- Wow, that's a lot of lilac.
- You're telling me.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.920
So how's it going?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.510
It's going good.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.360
Your mom is being so nice
and your dad's really cool.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.350
Your definition of cool

19:42.360 --> 19:44.960
must include a lame sense of humor,
ultracompetitive

19:44.970 --> 19:48.290
and has a sports analogy for everything.

19:49.190 --> 19:50.550
For me that is cool.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.660
Uh, hey.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.258
Uh, do you ever talk to that guy

19:57.258 --> 20:00.438
who contributed sperm to my existence?

20:00.438 --> 20:02.405
'Cause I kinda want to meet him one day.

20:02.438 --> 20:06.206
I'm not like secretly
in touch with him or anything,

20:06.239 --> 20:07.443
if that's what you think.

20:07.444 --> 20:08.926
But you must know something about him...

20:08.926 --> 20:11.343
like his name.

20:13.306 --> 20:15.927
He left when I was little.
What else do you need to know?

20:15.927 --> 20:17.614
Like everything.

20:19.491 --> 20:22.133
I'm just saying he had zero
interest in being a dad.

20:22.558 --> 20:23.924
He had zero interest in being your dad.

20:23.957 --> 20:25.823
He may not feel the same way about me.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.957
Really? Why is that?

20:30.790 --> 20:34.558
That's what I thought.

20:43.599 --> 20:45.208
So how was your first day?

20:45.239 --> 20:48.229
Oh, Geraldo is great.

20:48.229 --> 20:49.691
Yeah, he's the best.

20:51.061 --> 20:52.225
How'd it go with Denise?

20:53.474 --> 20:54.372
Not bad.

20:55.037 --> 20:57.518
Um, she's a little...

20:57.518 --> 21:00.801
Well, maybe this is what women
in your circle are like...

21:01.489 --> 21:04.296
Women in my circle? What are we, a coven?

21:04.296 --> 21:06.346
No, what I mean is

21:06.787 --> 21:09.901
she's a little insincere.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.020
Unbelievable.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.719
I get you a job and instead of thanking me,

21:15.956 --> 21:18.547
it's just another excuse for you
to judge me and my friends.

21:18.966 --> 21:21.456
Please. You got me the job at queen bee

21:21.456 --> 21:24.464
so more riff-raff like me didn't
come traipsing through your yard

21:24.464 --> 21:26.453
and give your neighbors
even more to gossip about.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.937
I don't even know why I try.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.482
Well...

21:32.639 --> 21:33.951
Come in!

21:36.002 --> 21:38.973
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Adriana.

21:42.001 --> 21:45.168
Honey, do you need something?

21:47.168 --> 21:50.102
I wanna ask you a favor.

21:50.135 --> 21:54.868
- Anything.
- I want to know about my father.

21:58.235 --> 22:01.935
- You already talked to Regina?
- Yeah.

22:01.968 --> 22:05.068
She doesn't seem to be
the biggest fan of the guy.

22:05.102 --> 22:08.935
- Was he really that bad?
- No.

22:12.035 --> 22:15.068
- It's a long story.
- Is he in prison?

22:15.102 --> 22:17.836
Is he like a spy or something?

22:17.868 --> 22:20.802
Nobody will talk about him.
Does Regina even know who he is?

22:24.202 --> 22:27.802
It was just so bad for both of them.

22:27.836 --> 22:31.202
If there's any way you could drop this?

22:34.068 --> 22:36.836
So you can't even tell me his name?

22:36.868 --> 22:39.235
I can't.

22:55.302 --> 22:57.935
Hey!

22:57.968 --> 23:00.769
Wow, a coach who makes house calls.

23:00.802 --> 23:04.068
Or my best friend who's
here for a bang trim.

23:05.094 --> 23:05.851
Hello.

23:06.714 --> 23:11.619
Um, this is Melody, my friend
and Daphne's basketball coach.

23:12.048 --> 23:14.836
- she's also...
- Deaf, hard of hearing,

23:14.868 --> 23:16.836
but never hearing-impaired.

23:16.868 --> 23:18.968
- Ah.
- Um...

23:19.001 --> 23:21.901
I was gonna say Emmett's mom.

23:22.667 --> 23:26.935
We love Emmett.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

23:26.968 --> 23:30.935
- You too.
- Daphne and I were about to play horse,

23:30.968 --> 23:33.901
if you'd care to join us or coach us.

23:35.802 --> 23:38.102
I'm just a guidance counselor filling in.

23:38.135 --> 23:40.901
I've had enough basketball for the day.

23:40.935 --> 23:42.901
All right.

23:42.935 --> 23:46.769
We're old friends with Regina.
She's just staying here until...

23:46.802 --> 23:49.168
- She knows the whole story.
- Oh.

23:52.135 --> 23:53.856
Well, we're just trying to

23:53.857 --> 23:56.968
keep it quiet till we get
used to it ourselves.

23:58.769 --> 23:59.503
Of course.

24:02.235 --> 24:04.001
Oh, hey, sweetie.

24:04.035 --> 24:06.035
My place... right there.

24:06.068 --> 24:06.887
Come on.

24:08.068 --> 24:09.407
Yeah.

24:12.797 --> 24:14.964
I don't wanna make this easy for you.

24:17.663 --> 24:20.564
H-o-r-s all around.
Okay, let's see what you've got.

24:20.598 --> 24:22.564
Can we finish this up tomorrow?

24:22.598 --> 24:24.797
What, are you quitting on me?

24:24.830 --> 24:28.265
No no, it's just I've got a lot of homework.

24:28.265 --> 24:30.867
The only way to wrap this up
is for you to make your shots.

24:30.867 --> 24:33.598
Here we go, come on. Come on.

24:35.030 --> 24:36.797
Okay, watch this.

24:36.830 --> 24:38.663
Watch this, ready? Watch this.

24:39.930 --> 24:42.663
Oh man!

24:47.607 --> 24:48.393
She seems smart,

24:48.951 --> 24:49.754
strong-willed,

24:50.645 --> 24:51.785
a little bit of a temper.

24:52.964 --> 24:54.797
Yeah.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.451
Oh, I haven't really gotten to know her yet.

25:01.894 --> 25:04.598
I'm taking it slow. Letting it happen.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.648
Don't get all guidance counselory on me.

25:18.997 --> 25:20.874
Nothing.

25:21.740 --> 25:23.972
It's just right now

25:24.006 --> 25:26.073
I'm the cool mom...

25:27.619 --> 25:31.584
Exotic, artsy, even a little heroic

25:31.584 --> 25:33.735
with my A.A. coins.

25:34.763 --> 25:38.336
You know, once she gets
to know the real me...

25:42.972 --> 25:46.510
Fine. Proud of yourself, Dr. Freud?

25:52.661 --> 25:55.988
Oh, that is what I call one sexy bartender.

25:56.497 --> 25:57.362
Beer please.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.011
Still the reigning horse champ?

26:00.011 --> 26:01.063
Yeah, it was a nail biter,

26:01.063 --> 26:03.223
but I finally got her on the hook shot.

26:03.223 --> 26:05.335
- Oooh.
- Works every time.

26:05.335 --> 26:07.933
Yeah. You know, it's weird.

26:08.006 --> 26:11.807
- It is so easy with Daphne.
- I know.

26:12.645 --> 26:15.740
She doesn't talk back.
She likes cooking, basketball.

26:19.482 --> 26:20.603
Don't put that on her.

26:21.942 --> 26:22.994
Nobody's perfect.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.398
She's a teenager.

26:26.667 --> 26:29.889
As human and flawed as...

26:32.740 --> 26:34.039
Bay.

26:44.655 --> 26:45.907
Hi?

26:45.907 --> 26:49.224
- Hey.
- Please tell me you're on your way.

26:50.151 --> 26:53.807
Not exactly. Um,
my foreman docked my pay today

26:53.807 --> 26:55.050
because I couldn't get to work,

26:55.840 --> 26:57.912
so now I can't buy the alternator I need.

26:57.912 --> 26:59.879
That authentically sucks.

27:00.514 --> 27:02.783
I know. I'm gonna have to bail.
Sorry about that.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.175
Catch you later.

27:11.007 --> 27:13.973
And what do you need this money for again?

27:14.007 --> 27:16.107
I need new paintbrushes.

27:16.140 --> 27:19.140
- What, are they made out of gold?
- Ostrich eyelashes.

27:20.274 --> 27:22.240
Seriously.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.940
What would Karl Marx say?

27:24.973 --> 27:26.240
Thanks.

27:36.174 --> 27:39.908
I can't believe I haven't
started my history paper yet.

27:41.140 --> 27:43.908
You shouldn't have spent
all night shooting baskets.

27:43.940 --> 27:47.140
- I couldn't just quit.
- Why not?

27:47.174 --> 27:49.274
He's not a big fan of quitting.

27:49.307 --> 27:53.973
You know, you don't have to
let him push you like that.

27:54.007 --> 27:58.240
I don't mind. I mean, that's
what having a dad is like, right?

28:07.940 --> 28:11.007
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.007
- What a nice surprise.
- It gets better.

28:15.573 --> 28:17.060
Now you can get your alternator.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.808
- I can't take that, Bay.
- Of course you can. Here.

28:24.874 --> 28:27.174
Seriously, I'm not gonna take your money.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.763
You don't have to pay it back
or anything. It's a gift.

28:31.763 --> 28:34.686
I don't want it, okay?

28:35.140 --> 28:37.262
Here in east Riverside,
we don't have rich white girls

28:37.262 --> 28:38.955
bailing us out with daddy's money.

28:40.416 --> 28:41.940
I was just trying to help.

28:41.973 --> 28:44.240
Yeah well, you're gonna
have to find yourself

28:44.274 --> 28:46.307
another charity, 'cause I ain't it.

28:49.274 --> 28:50.841
Okay.

30:14.883 --> 30:16.514
Oh, hear that crunch?

30:16.514 --> 30:18.880
- That's why I needed this baby.
- Hmph, needed.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.850
Here, in case you need a 10th amp.

30:22.244 --> 30:24.652
Decided not to paint with
the bird lashes after all?

30:24.899 --> 30:28.025
I tried to give the money to Ty
so that he could fix his truck.

30:28.912 --> 30:30.230
And why didn't you tell me

30:30.230 --> 30:31.980
that's why you needed
the money in the first place?

30:32.265 --> 30:34.663
Because I figured you'd
tell me it was a bad idea.

30:34.663 --> 30:36.013
It was a bad idea.

30:36.354 --> 30:37.857
What were you planning on
doing with his testicles

30:37.857 --> 30:41.307
- once you snipped them off?
- I was just trying to help!

30:42.134 --> 30:44.734
Dude, sometimes you are so mom.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.106
- Please.
- I'm serious.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.092
There's a lot more of her
in you than you know.

31:09.277 --> 31:12.211
Hi, just a quick question.

31:12.244 --> 31:14.737
Have you ever considered
using Daphne as a forward?

31:14.737 --> 31:17.099
I'm just saying because
if Daphne were playing forward,

31:17.523 --> 31:18.243
you could use that short

31:18.243 --> 31:20.563
girl with the ponytail
to cover the point guard.

31:20.735 --> 31:23.553
And then you'd use Daphne
for rebounding because, you know,

31:23.553 --> 31:26.153
you guys really could use help rebounding.

31:26.528 --> 31:27.723
I'm just saying.

31:36.394 --> 31:39.193
Here, all yours.

31:39.952 --> 31:41.211
Oh no no, I...

32:04.770 --> 32:06.279
- Yeah?
- So the good news is

32:06.279 --> 32:10.090
I replaced the timing belt in
my truck and got it running again.

32:10.424 --> 32:12.952
- Yeah?
- So I thought I'd come on over

32:12.952 --> 32:14.586
and let you know that

32:15.472 --> 32:17.678
I may have overreacted a little last night.

32:18.469 --> 32:20.420
- Yeah.
- The bad news is

32:20.420 --> 32:22.312
the belt wasn't really the problem

32:22.855 --> 32:25.261
and I just broke down next to Lewis park.

32:26.552 --> 32:27.280
Is there any chance you could

32:28.274 --> 32:30.378
come over here so I could
apologize in person?

32:31.425 --> 32:32.324
Seriously?

32:34.504 --> 32:36.134
Okay, let's hear it.

32:38.491 --> 32:39.523
I'm sorry.

32:41.654 --> 32:44.320
That's the big apology?

32:45.804 --> 32:46.867
I'm really sorry.

32:47.783 --> 32:50.087
Okay, I shouldn't have
gotten so bent out of shape

32:50.087 --> 32:51.887
- when you were saying...
- I just wanted to help.

32:51.887 --> 32:53.655
If you didn't want it, there were 100 better

32:53.655 --> 32:54.985
different ways you could have told me.

32:54.985 --> 32:57.477
And for the record, I'm not just white.

32:57.477 --> 33:00.353
I'm a quarter puerto rican,
and really who knows what else I am?

33:00.353 --> 33:01.643
All right? And...

33:10.503 --> 33:11.804
Okay, pass it.

33:11.837 --> 33:13.704
Good. Pass it... good.

33:13.737 --> 33:15.704
Pass it, pass it!

33:19.971 --> 33:22.382
Daphne, what are you doing?

33:23.615 --> 33:26.042
- Take it easy.
- No, we worked on this last night.

33:26.042 --> 33:27.742
It's fine. What are you doing?

33:28.403 --> 33:30.848
- Sorry.
- You have to show these girls how to do it, baby.

33:30.848 --> 33:33.077
We can't be taking stupid shots, all right?

33:33.565 --> 33:35.345
- Okay.
- Okay, so we're gonna do it one more time.

33:35.542 --> 33:37.952
All right? We're gonna
do it perfect. All right?

33:38.379 --> 33:40.923
Okay, here we go.
One more time, ladies. Let's go.

33:49.670 --> 33:52.207
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:52.570 --> 33:53.870
Can I give you a hand?

33:53.904 --> 33:56.603
No, I've got it.

33:57.870 --> 34:02.470
Let me guess: friday is
celebrating the orient night?

34:02.966 --> 34:04.033
That's not a judgment.

34:07.192 --> 34:09.089
Denise is stopping by tomorrow

34:09.089 --> 34:12.130
and I wanted to run a few ideas

34:12.130 --> 34:14.094
by her for the big fundraiser.

34:15.581 --> 34:18.060
By the way, she says that
restructuring you gave her

34:18.060 --> 34:20.445
- changed her life.
- Oh.

34:22.603 --> 34:25.837
- You need to tell her the truth.
- About those roots?

34:27.130 --> 34:28.601
About Bay and Daphne.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.337
Did she say something?

34:35.466 --> 34:37.792
Nobody is buying this friend thing

34:37.792 --> 34:41.699
and I'm sure the stories
she's making up to fill in the blanks

34:41.733 --> 34:43.666
are way worse than switched at birth.

34:43.699 --> 34:46.533
Maybe.

34:47.833 --> 34:51.023
I'm just afraid that when people find out,

34:51.023 --> 34:52.766
they're gonna treat Bay differently

34:52.800 --> 34:53.400
and let's face it,

34:53.400 --> 34:55.766
she hasn't had
an easy time fitting in as it is.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.666
If your friends and their kids
are gonna treat Bay differently

34:59.699 --> 35:02.566
then, honestly, you need new friends.

35:02.599 --> 35:05.766
Okay, it's not just Bay.

35:08.566 --> 35:13.399
I've never had a career.
Hell, I've never even stuck to a hobby.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.666
But the one thing that I have,

35:19.699 --> 35:23.666
the one thing that I am proud
of is that I'm a good mom.

35:27.666 --> 35:31.399
This whole time I was raising
somebody else's daughter

35:31.432 --> 35:34.699
and I didn't even know it.

35:39.432 --> 35:41.766
What does that say about me?

35:44.399 --> 35:46.366
Same thing it says about me, I guess.

35:49.963 --> 35:52.772
If you don't want me to tell your friends

35:52.772 --> 35:54.693
about the switch thing, I won't.

35:56.499 --> 35:58.366
Okay?

36:04.332 --> 36:06.566
Thanks.

36:08.432 --> 36:10.432
Good luck with this.

36:18.742 --> 36:21.974
Ladies, ladies, come on.
Let's get our heads in the game.

36:26.201 --> 36:26.954
What is she doing?

36:26.954 --> 36:29.798
You drive to the basket.
You're playing scared. Let's go.

36:31.143 --> 36:33.095
Come on, ladies. Come on.

36:34.381 --> 36:35.715
What is that? Come on!

36:36.522 --> 36:37.676
Daphne, come on!

36:38.224 --> 36:39.851
No more mental mistakes.

36:40.595 --> 36:42.958
Excuse me, what is that?

36:43.391 --> 36:44.725
You're better than this.

36:44.758 --> 36:47.291
Actually, I'm not.

36:47.324 --> 36:48.591
What do you mean you're...

36:48.625 --> 36:50.591
Where are you going, Daphne?

36:52.691 --> 36:54.792
Daphne, get back here!

37:02.147 --> 37:06.112
I... I got carried away. I'm sorry.

37:06.332 --> 37:07.828
I do that sometimes.

37:08.265 --> 37:10.517
It's probably why Bay hates basketball

37:10.517 --> 37:12.113
and Toby won't play with me.

37:12.466 --> 37:13.544
Did you say something?

37:13.544 --> 37:15.675
Uh, no no. Not important.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.045
I'm not that great a player.

37:19.045 --> 37:20.686
I'm not like Maya Moore or something.

37:21.209 --> 37:22.551
You know what? You could be.

37:23.042 --> 37:25.347
I see that kind of potential in you.

37:27.999 --> 37:29.899
You really think I play scared?

37:29.933 --> 37:31.612
I just think you...

37:32.058 --> 37:34.414
You don't like to play
outside of your comfort zone.

37:34.799 --> 37:36.833
You don't like to get into the fray.

37:37.593 --> 37:39.830
But, you know, that's
just something to work on.

37:40.866 --> 37:42.320
Whenever.

37:45.276 --> 37:46.138
Yeah, I know.

37:52.225 --> 37:55.325
- Can you drop me off somewhere?
- Sure.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.444
You guys, thanks. Enjoy.

38:07.325 --> 38:11.458
- So what's good?
- The firecracker shrimp is my favorite.

38:11.492 --> 38:14.425
But be warned: it's three-alarm hot.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.425
Not a problem.

38:17.492 --> 38:19.425
I like to live dangerously.

38:44.135 --> 38:46.719
And then finally I thought
we'd have the movie "Chinatown"

38:46.719 --> 38:49.355
- playing over here on the side.
- That could be interesting.

38:49.644 --> 38:51.789
Anyway, this is the vintage earrings

38:51.789 --> 38:53.735
I was telling you about for the auction.

38:53.735 --> 38:56.525
And if you need any more help
brainstorming, then let me know.

38:56.558 --> 38:58.953
- Thank you.
- Okay? See you later.

38:59.358 --> 39:00.875
Denise, wait.

39:02.715 --> 39:05.200
I wanted to tell you something.

39:08.818 --> 39:12.756
When Bay was born,
the hospital made a mistake.

39:14.325 --> 39:17.868
Bay's not our biological daughter.
She's Regina's.

39:18.258 --> 39:21.414
And Regina took home our daughter,

39:22.258 --> 39:25.516
so the girl she raised, Daphne,

39:26.523 --> 39:29.762
- she's our baby.
- I can't believe it.

39:30.931 --> 39:32.492
I know it's crazy.

39:32.525 --> 39:35.191
Oh my god, honey. I don't
know what I would have done.

39:35.225 --> 39:38.258
Well, when we found out,
we asked them to move in

39:38.291 --> 39:41.225
so that we could all get to know each other.

39:41.258 --> 39:45.458
Wow. And we all thought that
Regina was John's ex-lover

39:45.492 --> 39:48.191
and her daughter was John's love child.

39:48.225 --> 39:51.158
Really? Oh my god,
that's what people thought?

39:51.191 --> 39:53.325
Well, some.

39:53.358 --> 39:55.325
And for the record,

39:55.358 --> 39:59.258
I wouldn't have handled this situation
with nearly as much grace.

40:03.225 --> 40:05.392
Thanks.

40:14.225 --> 40:16.325
Come in.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.291
Hey.

40:21.225 --> 40:24.225
I just wanted to pop by and
see how you were doing.

40:24.258 --> 40:26.458
Fine.

40:28.931 --> 40:33.125
Nice... use of color and line.

40:33.158 --> 40:35.425
You don't have to do that.

40:40.392 --> 40:42.392
Hey, so what I wasn't able

40:42.425 --> 40:45.225
to tell you the other night
is that that lawsuit

40:45.258 --> 40:48.080
we've got with the hospital
has nothing to do with you.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.919
Your mom and I...

40:56.966 --> 40:59.281
are so lucky to have you in our lives.

41:01.225 --> 41:02.286
Really.

41:03.258 --> 41:04.276
Do you know why?

41:04.276 --> 41:09.974
'Cause you make us look at
the world differently, Bay.

41:11.802 --> 41:14.014
Like that... that painting.

41:14.014 --> 41:17.728
You took the word "Man"
and you made that actual guy,

41:17.728 --> 41:20.260
and the question mark and...

41:21.225 --> 41:22.725
that's amazing.

41:24.002 --> 41:26.678
And I have no idea how you did that.

41:27.258 --> 41:29.425
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

41:29.458 --> 41:32.125
The question mark... I wasn't sure

41:32.158 --> 41:33.258
anyone would get that.

41:35.225 --> 41:37.191
I'm not sure anybody would.

41:40.158 --> 41:42.258
But I did.

42:05.225 --> 42:07.091
Hey.

42:09.225 --> 42:12.258
I'm sorry about what I said the other day.

42:14.458 --> 42:16.525
It's fine.

42:22.225 --> 42:25.458
It sucks that your dad...

42:25.492 --> 42:28.392
My dad? I never know which pronoun to use.

42:28.425 --> 42:33.258
It sucks that that guy took off
when you were little.

42:33.291 --> 42:35.191
It sucks for both of us.

42:37.149 --> 42:38.592
Yeah, it does.

42:44.492 --> 42:46.492
There's something I want you to have.

42:51.258 --> 42:53.325
Your dad took it.

42:55.392 --> 42:58.325
That's you in there.
