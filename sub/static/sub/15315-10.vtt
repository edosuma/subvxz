00:16.840 --> 00:21.560
ROBIN:You realising how difficult
life can be in the forest?

00:21.600 --> 00:23.720
How long have you and
your men been following me?

00:23.760 --> 00:24.800
You're jumpy.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.880
Answer me!

00:26.920 --> 00:30.160
Gisborne, I have better
things to do with my day.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.480
I'm alone. TWIG SNAPS

00:41.200 --> 00:42.800
Very well.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.800
Really?

00:47.920 --> 00:50.680
You're really sure you
want to do this now?

00:52.840 --> 00:55.160
Why not? What, honestly?

00:57.800 --> 01:02.440
I don't think you have the energy. I
don't need food or sleep to drive me.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.840
Then what do you need? Revenge.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.640
On who? Prince John?
Prince John will keep.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.040
Isabella will not. Neither will you.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.760
Gisborne? Ah!

02:25.640 --> 02:30.120
WOLF HOWLS

02:30.160 --> 02:32.360
What is this?

02:32.400 --> 02:35.760
Who's done this? Hood? No.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.680
Where are you?

02:39.720 --> 02:43.640
You're a coward to take
us like this.Show yourself!

02:46.680 --> 02:48.000
Gisborne.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.120
Who sent you? Prince John?No, this
is one of your sister's tricks.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.480
What would Isabella want with us?

03:11.520 --> 03:14.720
I want you to listen and understand.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.760
Someone's life depends on it.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.040
I find it hard to
understand when I'm tied.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.320
Now free me! I'll free you.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.800
Free you from the bad blood
that shackles you to each other.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.840
Well, maybe there are good
reasons for that bad blood.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.360
What do you know about
our lives, anyway?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.280
More than you do.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.800
I know the truth.

03:38.840 --> 03:43.600
The truth about what? About
how your parents really died.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.160
My father's inside!

03:45.200 --> 03:49.600
Yours, too! And your
mother! Do something!

03:52.360 --> 03:55.080
You know about the fire.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.880
So? It was never a secret.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.120
Everybody knew that we both
became orphans that day.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.200
There are still things you
don't know about your past.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.160
Oh, Ghislaine, I've been
thinking about you all day.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.360
We do not have much time, but
if you wish to talk, then...

04:21.040 --> 04:25.160
Oh! Oh, I look forward to the
day when we no longer have to hide

04:25.200 --> 04:28.920
in stables and outhouses to
do this. Not long now, my love.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.520
My father loved one woman
only, and that was my mother.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.240
That's just what you were told.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.320
The truth was kept from
you by your precious father.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.440
What are you talking about?!

04:45.480 --> 04:47.560
He shielded you from
reality like he always did.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.960
You were never made to face the
consequences of your actions.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.800
You were once on a very
different path, Robin.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.400
Robin, come and give
Swain a hand! Yes, Father.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.760
Guy, Isabella, come with me.

05:13.160 --> 05:14.560
Ladies and gentlemen!

05:14.600 --> 05:17.600
I am so pleased you decided to join me

05:17.640 --> 05:22.360
in celebrating the safe return
of our men from the Holy Land.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.600
Sadly, not everyone was
able to make the journey back

05:26.640 --> 05:32.280
and I would ask that we think also of
our loved ones who died on this day.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.960
As you know, I feel your
pain as it is my own,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.960
my own husband being among the dead.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.840
My Lady Gisborne.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.520
As bailiff of these parts, it's my duty
to ask who will now be lord of the manor.

05:50.560 --> 05:55.600
Longthorn! Now is not the
time. No. He's right to ask.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.280
There will be no lord.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.920
Instead, there will
be a lady of the manor.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.800
So...

06:02.840 --> 06:05.840
we're expected to serve a woman.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.200
A French woman.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.440
The land should be
returned to Lord Locksley.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.760
Longthorn! This village was awarded

06:13.800 --> 06:16.400
to your husband for his
services in the Holy Land.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.720
Now he is dead, it's your
right to reclaim them.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.360
A right I will not be exercising.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.720
Sir Roger fought and
died for an English King.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.680
His family should be respected.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.920
To Sir Roger of Gisborne.
ALL:Sir Roger of Gisborne!

06:33.240 --> 06:38.360
Now, to celebrate
those who have returned

06:38.400 --> 06:41.800
and to honour those who have not,

06:41.840 --> 06:44.640
I want you to join me
in enjoying something

06:44.680 --> 06:46.840
the men have brought
back from their travels.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.600
The Fire Wheel will light our skies

06:50.640 --> 06:56.120
to show us that our darkest
days are now behind us.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.240
Now, I need two strong
men to lift the wheel,

06:59.280 --> 07:02.160
and thetwo best archers in the county.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.520
Robin, will you help me?

07:05.600 --> 07:08.640
And Guy? Father, may I?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.200
Robin... I want to make the shot.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.840
And you will, but not
because of the bow.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.520
You're not ready.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.040
I don't know why you're bothering, Guy.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.880
You're a terrible shot.

07:26.920 --> 07:30.880
I'm younger than you and everyone
knows I'm the best shot in the village.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.760
Only because you keep
telling everyone you are.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.520
I thought your father said
you couldn't use his bow.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.680
You're not ready. I'm going
to show him he was wrong.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.800
I can hit that lantern
with this. Watch.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.960
Don't be so stupid!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.560
Look what you've done!

07:55.960 --> 07:57.040
No!

08:16.040 --> 08:17.040
Seize the boy!

08:23.080 --> 08:24.400
Help me!

08:35.919 --> 08:38.320
Don't just stand there!
Somebody get a physician!

08:38.360 --> 08:40.600
Let me see him. I can help.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.320
Yousee?You see what your
stupid prank has done?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.760
I didn't do it. Who did, then?

08:44.800 --> 08:47.640
It wasn't me! Of course
it wasn't, Master Robin.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.280
You wouldn't fire at your
own father.No, I swear.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.000
He fired the arrow that caused the
priest's injuries. He's a murderer!

08:54.040 --> 08:58.520
I didn't... Huh? One
of yours, Master Guy?

08:58.560 --> 09:02.120
How dare you?!It's not a
question of daring, but duty.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.120
As bailiff, it's my
job to uphold the law.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.240
I warn you only to hold the boy.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.440
Any further action and you
will have me to answer to.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.760
What? No! He will only
be charged if he dies.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.760
Get him to the manor,
quickly. You heard her.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.560
Carefully! Carefully!

09:19.600 --> 09:22.040
Everybody out. Leave us. Let her work.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.880
His rib is broken and
it has punctured a lung.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.640
His chest is filling with air.
There must be something you can do.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.880
Ah, yes...

09:31.600 --> 09:33.280
What are you doing?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.720
It will release the air. Father...

09:41.000 --> 09:45.280
Just breathe. Careful. Better?
Father! They're going to hang Guy!

09:47.840 --> 09:50.120
I can't leave him. I cannot leave him.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.760
I'll put an end to this.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.880
Did you see the way she declared
herself lady of the manor?

09:58.920 --> 10:03.520
She has no right to this
estate! Like an eye for an eye.

10:03.560 --> 10:07.440
The boy must hang! Have you
taken leave of your senses?

10:07.480 --> 10:11.560
If you do this, you will
have to answer for it.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.240
We must all pay for
our actions, my lord.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.560
You were told not to
harm the boy. True.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.840
But now I feel compelled
by the will of the people,

10:19.880 --> 10:23.200
and they want justice,
and to that end...

10:24.160 --> 10:26.200
Then you force my hand... Stop!

10:26.240 --> 10:28.080
I command you to stop!
On whose authority?

10:28.120 --> 10:31.080
The King's, as he made
me lord of this manor.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.960
I'm Sir Roger of Gisborne,
this boy's father.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.640
No!What? You doubt my word?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.040
We thought you were dead.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.720
I was captured, not killed.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.280
Out of my way. I can't do that.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.680
As bailiff, I must uphold the law.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.400
You are no longer
bailiff! Out of my way!

11:00.680 --> 11:05.400
You will never hold office again
as long as I'm lord of this manor.

11:05.440 --> 11:08.440
He will live! Swain will live!

11:15.360 --> 11:16.520
Roger!

11:18.160 --> 11:21.000
They told me...

11:21.040 --> 11:23.000
I was captured.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.440
There was no way to get word to
you. Captured? Did they hurt you?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.000
I must talk with you
at once, Ghislaine.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.600
ROBIN: I was truly sorry
for what happened that night.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.600
It was a mistake which I learnt from.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.560
And it was one that
made me a better man.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.480
Do you think Mother watches me?

11:51.520 --> 11:53.040
From heaven?

11:54.320 --> 11:58.200
I'm sure she does. I'm sure
she sees everything you do.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.000
Father...

12:06.040 --> 12:09.200
it was me that shot the arrow.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.720
I was showing off

12:11.760 --> 12:14.080
with your bow.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.840
Robin...

12:18.360 --> 12:21.920
...one day you will
be lord of Locksley,

12:21.960 --> 12:23.840
lord of my lands.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.280
You must grow up and learn
to take responsibility

12:26.320 --> 12:28.120
when you do something wrong.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.560
You could be the best shot in England.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.560
You shouldn't stand by and
let something terrible happen

12:34.600 --> 12:37.400
because you were too scared
to do the right thing.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.240
Do you understand?

12:40.800 --> 12:42.560
Yes.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.240
GISBORNE:Ah, how touching(!)

12:52.280 --> 12:55.520
Look, I really don't see
the point of any of this.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.000
You need to know the
truth to save a life.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.200
Oh, we should not do this.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.600
Malcolm...

13:20.640 --> 13:23.360
I have done what I thought was right.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.400
I have stayed away from you.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.360
You have no idea how hard that's been.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.280
Of course I do. But you
understand, I had to care for Roger.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.600
I understand more than you think.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.120
I know about his affliction.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
How?The night of his return,

13:42.040 --> 13:45.920
Longthorn's dagger went straight through
his hand and he didn't even cry out.

13:51.360 --> 13:55.880
He told me he was
infected in the Holy Land.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.280
All he wanted was to get back home and
spend his last days with his family.

14:00.320 --> 14:05.800
He made his own way home, away from
his soldiers, so they wouldn't know.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.400
But people will know.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.080
There is talk about the bandages.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.000
The fact he barely leaves
your house. He is a sick man!

14:13.040 --> 14:18.400
He is a leper! And if he is
discovered you will all be cast out.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.000
You should not have been put
in this position, Ghislaine.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.160
There is something else.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.600
More lies! There was never any child.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.720
What are you doing?

15:09.760 --> 15:13.000
If you think me a liar, there's
no point in you being here.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.400
You're going to kill me with
no means to defend myself?

15:16.440 --> 15:20.560
I expected nothing less
from you, Bailiff Longthorn!

15:23.960 --> 15:25.960
Hear my story or walk away.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.520
But if you do, your brother will die.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.640
Do you want that on your consciences?

15:37.160 --> 15:38.800
Keep talking.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.320
You understand now?

15:40.360 --> 15:42.280
I must go away.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.360
Roger will know for sure
this is not his child.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.760
Then I will declare my feelings
for you and we can be a family.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.600
But I am married to another man!

15:50.640 --> 15:53.600
If he is discovered, he will
be banished from the village.

15:53.640 --> 15:57.240
He'll be stripped of his title,
his lands. You will have nothing.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.800
Ghislaine, listen.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.600
If he is declared a leper
you will be given a choice.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.800
You can declare yourself a widow.

16:04.840 --> 16:08.240
But that would be a lie!
In the eyes of God...

16:08.280 --> 16:11.120
In the eyes of the law,
you will be free of him.

16:11.160 --> 16:15.640
But the baby will show.
People will still know.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.480
Roger has been back a very short time.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.600
Then you will have our baby in secret.
I will arrange for it to be taken away.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.920
No!Only for a short while!

16:25.960 --> 16:28.680
Once you are recovered from the birth,

16:28.720 --> 16:31.800
you can go on a pilgrimage
and bring him back.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.560
Claim he is a foundling
- an orphan.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.640
With that, we can be a family.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.520
Roger, I did not expect to see you.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.320
I was restless. I went for a ride.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.720
Of course.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.760
And on this ride, did
you happen to see anyone?

17:04.800 --> 17:06.920
Malcolm Locksley, perhaps?

17:10.040 --> 17:15.280
How did you know?
Because I am your husband.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.640
And I have failed you as a wife.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.440
No.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.680
It is I who failed you...

17:33.720 --> 17:36.920
leaving you alone and
returning like this.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.520
No, Roger...

17:38.560 --> 17:42.680
You will never know how grateful
I am that you've kept my secret,

17:42.720 --> 17:47.200
and allowed me to see out my
days with you and the children.

17:47.240 --> 17:53.080
And I'm glad you've found someone
who will care for you when I've gone.

17:59.800 --> 18:04.400
All I ask is that he has the
patienceto wait until that day.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.720
Roger, you must go.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.760
Not for me,

18:13.800 --> 18:16.760
for yourself
- now.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.000
I don't understand.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.920
I'm sorry. I thought that
I was doing the right thing.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.560
You must leave right away.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.480
POUNDING ON DOOR

18:27.640 --> 18:28.640
Not already...

18:35.720 --> 18:40.720
Sir Roger, I think you
know why we're here.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.400
Oh, will you not show him mercy?

19:14.440 --> 19:17.920
I saved your life! I'm
sorry. This is God's will.

19:31.040 --> 19:34.680
Roger of Gisborne, you are
a leper... Mother, please.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.160
...and, as such, are to be cast
out from the society of others.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.840
No, don't let them do this. Guy!

19:40.880 --> 19:43.000
You must act like a
man and not a child.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.720
Do not shame me.

19:44.760 --> 19:49.600
From this day forward you are
deemed unclean. Do you understand?

19:49.640 --> 19:51.080
I do.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.000
As his wife, you may go with him

19:54.040 --> 19:58.400
or you may declare yourself a widow
and be free of your impediment.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.480
Impediment? He is my husband!

20:00.520 --> 20:03.480
Ghislaine, you must set an
example for the children.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.240
Do you declare?

20:20.400 --> 20:21.880
Yes.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.840
From today I am a widow.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.280
Very well.

20:30.280 --> 20:36.040
Roger of Gisborne, I forbid you
ever to enter any church, market,

20:36.080 --> 20:40.720
tavern or any assembly of people.

20:40.760 --> 20:44.280
I forbid you to drink or eat
from any vessel but your own.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.960
I forbid you to touch any child.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.480
Now you must leave this place.

21:20.760 --> 21:23.560
Thank you. Care for her.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.040
Care for them all.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.680
Father!

21:31.720 --> 21:33.160
Get away from me!

21:44.640 --> 21:46.720
You did this.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.320
I'll never forgive you.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.720
I'm not going in here.
It's a leper's house.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.280
Shut your mouth! Why? It's true.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.120
Your father is a leper... Shut up!

21:59.160 --> 22:01.320
Guy, no!

22:02.680 --> 22:04.760
It is a good thing your
father is not here to see this.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.200
He would be ashamed of your behaviour.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.000
Hey!

22:09.040 --> 22:10.440
Robin! No more. But he...

22:10.480 --> 22:12.880
Imagine you had lost what he has lost.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.000
Go and find him, make
your apologies. Go!

22:19.800 --> 22:20.920
Lady Gisborne...

22:22.040 --> 22:24.200
...Lord Malcolm.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.520
How fortuitous to
find you both together.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.880
Have you told the
children the good news?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.080
What?

22:32.120 --> 22:36.200
Do you think they'll want a
little brother or a sister?

22:39.840 --> 22:41.520
You've been spying on us?

22:41.560 --> 22:46.960
I've been looking for an opportunity to get what I deserve
- lands of my own.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.000
You will give me yours, lady,

22:50.040 --> 22:52.480
unless you want everyone
to know your little secret.

22:53.920 --> 22:58.160
Very well. Go to Nottingham,
have the deeds drawn up.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.320
Thank you, my lord.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.640
Malcolm, the lands have to pass to Guy.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.360
And they will.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.160
On Saturday we shall be married.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.520
Your lands will become mine and
Longthorn's deeds will be worthless.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.800
Saturday? The children
have just lost their father!

23:17.840 --> 23:20.400
But we must marry soon.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.640
ROBIN: They never married.

23:25.680 --> 23:29.360
No, they only ever planned to.

23:30.520 --> 23:31.960
Didn't they, Guy?

23:35.360 --> 23:36.640
You knew?

23:38.560 --> 23:39.960
I found out.

23:42.560 --> 23:46.760
I saw my mother making
her way into the forest,

23:46.800 --> 23:49.480
and so I followed.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.040
She still loved him.

23:54.720 --> 23:58.120
I was so angry.She told me
that I had to forget him...

24:00.320 --> 24:02.800
...pretend that he didn't exist.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.400
Yet here she was,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.760
denying me my father.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.520
How could you? Guy! You frightened me.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.400
I saw you with Father. You said...

24:27.440 --> 24:29.920
I could not just abandon him.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.440
He needs care.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.720
You said he was gone. I know.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.680
Did Malcolm make you do it?
I've seen how he looks at you.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.400
He wants you for himself.
Malcolm is a good man, Guy.

24:40.440 --> 24:45.360
He can take care of us now
that your father cannot.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.760
We are to be married. Married?

24:49.800 --> 24:54.600
Yes, on Saturday. It is for
the best. All will be well.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.520
But you must promise not to
speak of it until it is done.

24:58.560 --> 25:02.160
Why? Why must it be a
secret? Just promise me.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.920
You must tell no-one
- especially Robin.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.840
He must hear it from his father.
You don't have to do this, Mother.

25:08.880 --> 25:13.000
Let's leave Nottingham, go back to France,
take Father with us. We'll be together...

25:13.040 --> 25:14.960
Mon dieu!

25:15.000 --> 25:18.480
What is it? Ah! Get help! Get help!

25:20.240 --> 25:22.240
Hurry, Guy, please!

25:22.280 --> 25:25.040
I'd never run so fast.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.080
I thought that...

25:27.120 --> 25:29.120
STRANGER:She was in labour.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.720
I see that now.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.040
What happened to the baby?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.560
He was early...

25:43.600 --> 25:45.120
but strong.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.160
Look.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.960
He is so quiet...

25:57.000 --> 25:59.240
like he knows he's a secret.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.480
And look at this.

26:06.760 --> 26:12.000
My son, by this mark, you
will never be lost to me.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.560
Ghislaine...

26:13.600 --> 26:15.640
I have thought of a name.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.440
Archer.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.600
Do you think it suits?

26:19.640 --> 26:21.440
I do.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.720
But it's...

26:24.760 --> 26:27.920
I know. It is time.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.520
STRANGER:The baby was to
be taken to a safe place

26:41.560 --> 26:44.040
until the parents could marry

26:44.080 --> 26:46.040
and reclaim him.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.920
You ride carefully.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.680
You carry precious cargo.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.240
THUNDER CRASHES Go.

26:57.880 --> 27:02.000
And that was the last he or
Ghislaineever saw of their son.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.400
CROWS CAW

27:19.400 --> 27:21.400
Father?

27:26.080 --> 27:27.840
My son. Wh...?

27:30.200 --> 27:31.520
Come with me.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.560
You should not have come here.
I needed to tell you something.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.840
Malcolm Locksley is
forcing Mother to marry him.

27:42.880 --> 27:46.240
The wedding is tomorrow.
You must stop them.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.080
No.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.960
That's no longer my right.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.600
You must try and understand.
Your mother needs a husband,

27:55.640 --> 27:58.320
and you need a father. I
thought I already had one.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.360
Guy... I thought you loved us,

28:00.400 --> 28:02.040
even when you went to the war.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.400
But you can't love us.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.000
If you did, you would
never let this happen.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.240
If you did, you'd fight for us!

28:09.280 --> 28:11.360
Leave me be.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.880
Leper.

28:35.200 --> 28:40.280
I've readied an altar in the woods.
He's back - the leper - Guy's father!

28:40.320 --> 28:42.640
He's in their house.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
Hold!

28:48.120 --> 28:51.120
What's going on? The leper's back.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.840
Do you hear that?

28:55.880 --> 28:57.360
The leper's back...

28:58.720 --> 29:00.800
...risking all our lives again!

29:00.840 --> 29:02.360
Come on.

29:03.360 --> 29:04.920
Come on!

29:06.520 --> 29:08.440
Where is he?

29:16.040 --> 29:17.560
Out of my way, boy.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.800
No! Not after what
you did to my father!

29:31.520 --> 29:34.760
Get out! Get out! Get
your sister out of here!

29:42.520 --> 29:45.600
Ghislaine, there is a
fire. You must leave now.

29:47.280 --> 29:50.720
You were told not to return.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.360
You expected me to stay away
whilst you stole my wife?

29:53.400 --> 29:56.480
Your wife? The woman that
you abandoned for years?

29:56.520 --> 29:58.680
Oh, please don't do this!

29:58.720 --> 30:02.200
Why are you not leaving? Go!
Go! Not without you. Both of you!

30:02.240 --> 30:06.160
I was wrong to give up without a fight.

30:06.200 --> 30:10.160
I see clearly now how you had things
planned from the moment I returned.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.360
You brought disease to your family!

30:12.400 --> 30:16.560
If you loved them, you
would have stayed away.

30:16.600 --> 30:22.280
You know nothing of our love. It was
she who came to me in the leper colony.

30:22.320 --> 30:27.800
But perhaps your hold over her
wasn't as strong as you thought.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.800
Malcolm! Malcolm!

30:31.840 --> 30:35.400
He is my husband, the
father of my children!

30:36.200 --> 30:37.440
And so am I!

30:38.840 --> 30:40.600
Our son.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.240
There is a child?!

30:53.760 --> 30:56.840
Look! Sir Malcolm is burning the place!

30:56.880 --> 30:58.560
No! It was an accident.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.680
The only way to get rid of the disease!

31:00.720 --> 31:02.640
Come on!No, you're wrong!

31:02.680 --> 31:06.200
Don't do this!Stop! Stop!

31:06.240 --> 31:08.040
Wait! My father's inside!

31:08.080 --> 31:10.680
No! No!

31:10.720 --> 31:13.280
GUY: I should have saved her.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.520
I should have braved the flames.

31:20.280 --> 31:24.000
It would have been too
late. You don't know that.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.400
She was already dead.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.440
GHISLAINE:No!

31:50.200 --> 31:51.560
Please!

31:52.600 --> 31:55.800
This solves nothing. Enough!

32:29.880 --> 32:31.880
She's dead.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.200
Get off!

32:52.560 --> 32:54.160
What will that achieve?

32:54.200 --> 32:57.160
He didn't kill Ghislaine.
No, but his father did.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.920
And as his father's
dead... No, he isn't.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.840
Explain yourself.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.120
Go.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.160
My children will be
better off without me...

33:20.800 --> 33:24.720
...and I wish only to spend
my last moments with my wife...

33:24.760 --> 33:27.040
alone.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.000
Please!

33:49.880 --> 33:51.120
Robin!

33:51.160 --> 33:54.080
Let me go! My father's inside!

33:54.120 --> 33:58.320
Yours, too! And your
mother! Do something!

34:01.120 --> 34:03.280
Get off me!

34:03.320 --> 34:05.960
My father would never
have left me alone!

34:16.920 --> 34:19.080
No...

34:23.440 --> 34:24.920
No!

34:29.080 --> 34:31.080
I'm sorry, Robin.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.440
No!

34:35.239 --> 34:37.040
I mourned for you!

34:41.520 --> 34:45.760
How could I be your father
after what I had done?

34:47.520 --> 34:50.480
After all I'd taught you about honour?

34:50.520 --> 34:52.760
Robin...

34:54.679 --> 34:57.880
...I couldn't bear to see
the shame in your eyes.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.560
GUY: You killed her.

35:04.600 --> 35:08.040
All these years, I
thought it was my fault -

35:08.080 --> 35:11.360
that my parents died because
of the fire that I started -

35:11.400 --> 35:13.000
but it was you.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.080
That guilt was with me every day.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.720
Every day!

35:19.760 --> 35:22.320
Get off him! Can't you
see he deserves this?

35:22.360 --> 35:24.000
He betrayed us both!

35:25.000 --> 35:26.480
You're right.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.800
Death would be a release.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.480
There have been many times when I've
been tempted to do the job myself.

35:35.520 --> 35:39.320
And you expect us to feel
sorry for you?Of course not.

35:39.360 --> 35:42.920
So why now? Why tell
us after all this time?

35:42.960 --> 35:45.040
Because of your brother.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.240
I need you to forgive each other...

35:51.720 --> 35:53.440
...so that you can unite

35:53.480 --> 35:56.400
and save him.This again!

35:56.440 --> 35:59.600
Everything I have
told you is the truth.

35:59.640 --> 36:02.000
And I have told you

36:02.040 --> 36:04.560
so you don't destroy each other,

36:04.600 --> 36:06.920
like your fathers.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.280
Son...

36:10.320 --> 36:11.720
No.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.840
You lost the right to call me son
when you left me alone in the world.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.400
Maybe.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.400
But didn't it make you
the man you are today?

36:33.840 --> 36:35.440
Children...

36:35.480 --> 36:39.720
we've searched what is
left of Gisborne Manor.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.840
Your parents...

36:42.880 --> 36:44.720
there's nothing left.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.280
You killed them!

36:47.320 --> 36:50.920
All of you
- you murdered them. You started the fire, boy.

36:54.720 --> 36:58.520
That's right, you go back
to where you came from.

36:58.560 --> 37:01.400
News of your father's shame
won't have reached France yet.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.680
You're no longer welcome
anywhere near my lands.

37:04.720 --> 37:08.360
YOUR lands? Longthorn,

37:08.400 --> 37:11.000
you are not a noble
- you have no right to this land.

37:11.040 --> 37:14.000
The village will become part
of the Locksley estate again.

37:14.040 --> 37:18.320
They are Robin's lands now. Me?

37:18.360 --> 37:21.040
Him? You run along.

37:21.080 --> 37:23.280
There's no room for
you here now, either.

37:23.320 --> 37:26.400
Robin, he's stealing from
you, from your poor father.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.360
I'm doing the boy a kindness.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.760
Do you really think you
can run this estate, boy,

37:32.800 --> 37:36.880
feed the people when they're
hungry, clothe them when they freeze?

37:36.920 --> 37:38.400
You're just a child.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.560
Robin! I thought not.
The duty falls to me.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.400
Right, let's start as we
mean to go on, shall we?

37:48.440 --> 37:50.440
Tax collection.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.720
I don't know what to do.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.440
MALCOLM: You shouldn't stand by
and let something terrible happen

38:13.480 --> 38:16.200
because you were too scared
to do the right thing.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.640
Thank you.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.360
Thank you.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.880
WOMAN: Leave us alone! Leave us alone!

38:56.520 --> 38:57.680
Leave them be!

38:59.840 --> 39:00.720
Ignore him.

39:06.680 --> 39:10.320
Next time, I won't miss.
You stupid little boy!

39:12.680 --> 39:15.920
My father never struck
me. Neither will you.

39:15.960 --> 39:20.720
These are my people and I will
care for them as my father intended.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.800
I am lord of the manor now.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.080
We'll see how long that lasts.

39:25.120 --> 39:28.600
Wait till you have to deal with your
first poor harvest or bad winter.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.640
You'll be begging for
help. And he will have it.

39:31.680 --> 39:36.760
What? From a simpering
priest and a few villagers?

39:46.040 --> 39:47.520
MAN:Go on, get out of here.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.080
LAUGHTER

39:52.120 --> 39:54.240
CHEERING

40:02.920 --> 40:05.920
Both of your lives could
have been so different

40:05.960 --> 40:09.680
were it not for the
mistakes your parents made.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.240
We can't change that, and
I can never forgive Guy.

40:12.280 --> 40:13.280
Why not?

40:13.320 --> 40:16.520
Because he showed no remorse
for what he did to Marian.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.560
You know nothing.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.040
You worked and killed
for the Sheriff for years.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.960
You'd still be under
his power without me!

40:22.000 --> 40:23.040
What do you mean?

40:31.880 --> 40:33.240
You killed the Sheriff.

40:33.280 --> 40:36.800
And I intend to kill the new one, too.

40:36.840 --> 40:40.240
First, join and save your
brother. You know where he is?

40:40.280 --> 40:41.840
Finally...

40:42.840 --> 40:45.120
...after many years of searching.

40:45.160 --> 40:51.840
I thought if I could find him, tell
him the truth about who he was...

40:51.880 --> 40:55.840
It seemed the right thing
to do... for Ghislaine.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.920
It wasn't easy.

40:58.960 --> 41:05.120
He doesn't stay in the same place
for long, but now he has no choice.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.480
Where is he?

41:08.520 --> 41:10.760
York jail.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.040
He is to hang.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.320
I'm too sick to help.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.120
I'm dying, Robin.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.560
Father...

41:24.600 --> 41:28.120
You are my last chance.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.040
Together, I know you can both do this.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.280
Remember the birthmark...

41:33.320 --> 41:35.240
shaped like an arrow-head.

41:36.800 --> 41:40.120
That is why your
mother named him Archer.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.240
You'll do this for me?

41:48.400 --> 41:50.320
I won't let him die, Father.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.200
I wish I could see you
three together at last.

42:08.240 --> 42:13.080
Well, surely we have
more time... I'm sorry.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.280
No!

42:18.920 --> 42:20.840
Look, I have no desire
to see you again...

42:29.840 --> 42:31.320
Save him...

42:35.600 --> 42:37.880
...and save yourselves.

42:52.880 --> 42:54.360
Urgh.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.520
Gisborne...Enough.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.280
No more talk.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.840
But what do you think we should...?

43:12.880 --> 43:14.400
To York.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.720
Oh, oh, oh...

43:41.280 --> 43:43.720
Gisborne has chosen to join
us in our struggle, John.

43:44.640 --> 43:48.160
Our brother is in jail in
York, awaiting execution.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.200
Who is this brother, Robin?

43:49.240 --> 43:50.720
I'm Archer.

43:50.760 --> 43:53.080
He brings back mysteries
from the Orient, Harold.

43:53.120 --> 43:55.600
Me and Gisborne will go
to York and bring him back.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.120
Go to the Sheriff of York.

43:58.160 --> 44:01.520
Tell him I will offer 100
crowns for their heads.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.840
Stop!

44:04.800 --> 44:06.320
Prepare them all to die.
