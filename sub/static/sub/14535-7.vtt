<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "The American West"...</i>

00:08.208 --> 00:09.291
( explosion )

00:09.291 --> 00:11.041
<i> The nation and big business</i>

00:11.041 --> 00:14.625
<i> struggle to settle</i>
<i> the western frontier.</i>

00:14.625 --> 00:17.709
<i> And deputy marshal</i>
<i> of Dodge City Wyatt Earp</i>

00:17.709 --> 00:20.667
<i> has discovered</i>
<i> that with more money</i>

00:20.667 --> 00:22.667
<i> comes more corruption.</i>

00:22.667 --> 00:25.250
<i> So the lawman</i>
<i> turns in his badge</i>

00:25.250 --> 00:28.750
<i> and heads further west</i>
<i> to new opportunity</i>

00:28.750 --> 00:31.500
<i> in a town called Tombstone.</i>

00:33.542 --> 00:36.542
<i> Meanwhile in Missouri,</i>

00:36.542 --> 00:40.166
<i> after three years in hiding,</i>

00:40.166 --> 00:44.083
<i> notorious outlaw</i>
<i> Jesse James reemerges...</i>

00:44.792 --> 00:47.208
I want everybody's attention,
and I want it now!

00:47.208 --> 00:48.792
Narrator:
<i> ...with a new gang</i>

00:48.792 --> 00:51.250
<i> and once again finds himself</i>

00:51.250 --> 00:53.500
<i> one of the country's</i>
<i> most wanted men.</i>

00:55.333 --> 00:57.208
<i> In New Mexico,</i>

00:57.208 --> 01:01.500
<i> Billy the Kid has been</i>
<i> on a murderous rampage.</i>

01:01.500 --> 01:03.583
<i> But when the law</i>
<i> finally catches up to him...</i>

01:03.583 --> 01:05.333
Garrett:
<i>It's Pat Garrett!</i>

01:05.375 --> 01:08.375
<i> ...Billy will have to plan</i>
<i> his next move...</i>

01:09.792 --> 01:12.458
<i> from behind bars.</i>

01:13.417 --> 01:16.542
<i> ( theme song playing )</i>

02:22.542 --> 02:25.834
You really kill 21 men?

02:30.500 --> 02:32.583
Don't believe everything
you read in the paper.

02:34.875 --> 02:38.750
You know,
I was never a criminal
until the law made me one.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.500
I had a reason

02:40.500 --> 02:42.500
for every man I killed.

02:44.542 --> 02:47.583
How many reasons
did you have?

02:48.333 --> 02:49.834
Twenty-one.

02:55.709 --> 02:59.375
Narrator:
<i> After surrendering</i>
<i> to lawman Pat Garrett,</i>

02:59.375 --> 03:01.375
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> awaits his trial</i>

03:01.375 --> 03:02.750
<i> for the murder of corrupt</i>

03:02.750 --> 03:05.834
<i> Lincoln County Sheriff</i>
<i> William J. Brady.</i>

03:08.834 --> 03:13.375
<i> As news of</i>
<i> Brady's murder spreads,</i>

03:13.375 --> 03:16.625
<i> it only adds to the West's</i>
<i> violent reputation.</i>

03:19.667 --> 03:21.625
David Eisenbach:
<i> During this period</i>
<i> in the West,</i>

03:21.625 --> 03:24.166
<i> they're just trying</i>
<i> to protect their bottom line.</i>

03:24.166 --> 03:27.417
Everybody's saying in order
to transact business,

03:27.417 --> 03:31.166
we need to put clamps
on all this lawlessness.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.834
Narrator:
<i> The government knows</i>
<i> they can use Billy the Kid</i>

03:33.834 --> 03:38.458
<i> to send a message</i>
<i> about lawlessness in the West.</i>

03:38.458 --> 03:40.709
Paul Hutton:
<i> In the entire</i>
<i> Lincoln County War,</i>

03:40.709 --> 03:42.959
Billy the Kid is the only one
charged with any crime

03:42.959 --> 03:44.583
and that's because
the territory

03:44.583 --> 03:45.917
was determined
to get rid of him.

03:45.917 --> 03:49.375
He was bad for business.
He's just too reckless.

03:49.375 --> 03:51.417
<i> We can't have outlaws</i>

03:51.417 --> 03:53.458
<i> if we're gonna bring</i>
<i> business to New Mexico.</i>

03:55.709 --> 03:58.750
Narrator:
<i> In a trial that</i>
<i> only lasts one day,</i>

03:58.750 --> 04:00.875
<i> Billy is sentenced to hang.</i>

04:03.458 --> 04:05.458
<i> But New Mexico's</i>
<i> infamous outlaw</i>

04:05.458 --> 04:08.417
<i> isn't ready to give in</i>
<i> just yet.</i>

04:23.792 --> 04:25.625
Lunchtime, Billy.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.583
Cold grits,
just how you like 'em.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.875
Kathleen Chamberlain:
<i> Pat Garrett left</i>
<i> Billy the Kid</i>

04:36.875 --> 04:38.917
with two deputies.

04:38.917 --> 04:42.750
One was a nice man
named Deputy Bell.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.417
<i> The other was a man</i>
<i> named Bob Olinger,</i>

04:45.417 --> 04:47.959
<i> who was a mean, mean guy.</i>

04:47.959 --> 04:49.583
And Billy hated him.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.001
Not so tough anymore.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.917
Enjoy the gruel.

05:03.917 --> 05:06.917
<i> ( door opens, closes )</i>

05:13.750 --> 05:16.750
Chamberlain:
<i> When Billy was in the jail,</i>

05:16.750 --> 05:20.041
<i> he was thinking...</i>

05:20.041 --> 05:22.834
<i> "How can I</i>
<i> get out of this?"</i>

05:25.959 --> 05:29.458
He was not going
to hang easily.

05:38.667 --> 05:39.959
Damn.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.792
A little help?

05:47.917 --> 05:50.542
What, you want me
to feed ya?

05:50.542 --> 05:52.917
Unless you got
a better idea.

06:04.583 --> 06:05.834
Stand up.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.083
I'm taking this shackle off.
Once you're done eatin',

06:17.083 --> 06:18.667
it goes right back on.

06:20.001 --> 06:22.875
You got five minutes.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.667
Hey, Deputy?

06:32.750 --> 06:34.917
Ah!

06:37.083 --> 06:38.709
Bell.

06:38.709 --> 06:39.834
Bell, don't.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.083
<i> ( shackles clatter )</i>

06:59.709 --> 07:01.709
Narrator:
<i> Once again, Billy the Kid</i>

07:01.709 --> 07:04.375
<i> has pulled off</i>
<i> an impossible escape</i>

07:04.375 --> 07:06.001
<i> that leaves</i>
<i> two deputies dead.</i>

07:07.709 --> 07:09.709
Kiefer Sutherland:
<i> He was a very charming guy,</i>

07:09.709 --> 07:14.375
but he literally had no problem
killing anybody.

07:14.375 --> 07:17.875
Narrator:
<i> Now the most famous outlaw</i>
<i> in the West</i>

07:17.875 --> 07:20.125
<i> is back on the run.</i>

07:25.375 --> 07:27.625
<i> Four hundred miles away...</i>

07:31.166 --> 07:33.709
<i> former lawman Wyatt Earp</i>
<i> has moved on</i>

07:33.709 --> 07:36.125
<i> from the corrupt town</i>
<i> of Dodge City...</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:40.834
<i> and is looking</i>
<i> to strike it rich</i>

07:40.834 --> 07:43.959
<i> in one of the biggest</i>
<i> new boomtowns in the West...</i>

07:45.542 --> 07:47.667
<i> Tombstone, Arizona.</i>

07:49.417 --> 07:51.959
Ann Kirschner:
<i> Tombstone explodes</i>
<i> on the scene</i>

07:51.959 --> 07:53.875
because silver
had been discovered there.

07:56.625 --> 08:01.417
<i> One day you were looking at</i>
<i>a desert landscape of mesquite,</i>

08:01.417 --> 08:04.583
<i> and then, as if a magician</i>
<i> had waved a wand,</i>

08:04.583 --> 08:05.875
suddenly you had a town.

08:08.917 --> 08:13.125
Tombstone was
the absolutely typical boomtown.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.083
<i> Once that word got out,</i>

08:15.083 --> 08:17.750
<i> it swelled in size</i>
<i> dramatically.</i>

08:17.750 --> 08:19.917
The usual things
that come along with it--

08:19.917 --> 08:22.583
the gambling,
the prostitution,

08:22.583 --> 08:24.917
but also a lot
of legitimate businesses.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.750
- To Tombstone.
- To Tombstone.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.834
<i> ( glasses clink )</i>

08:33.834 --> 08:36.709
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt's brothers</i>
<i> Virgil and Morgan join him</i>

08:36.709 --> 08:38.750
<i> in his plan</i>
<i> to mine silver.</i>

08:45.083 --> 08:47.875
<i> But the Earps</i>
<i> quickly discover</i>

08:47.875 --> 08:50.625
<i> that the best mining land</i>
<i> has already been claimed.</i>

08:54.041 --> 08:56.208
<i> After traveling</i>
<i> nearly 900 miles</i>

08:56.208 --> 08:58.625
<i> to seek out his fortune,</i>

08:58.625 --> 09:02.750
<i> Wyatt's prospects</i>
<i> are growing dim.</i>

09:02.750 --> 09:06.166
<i> But the boomtown</i>
<i> has a new problem,</i>

09:06.208 --> 09:10.166
<i> and Wyatt may be</i>
<i> the perfect man to solve it.</i>

09:17.959 --> 09:20.041
Anne Collier:
<i> Tombstone in the early 1880s</i>

09:20.041 --> 09:22.750
<i> was your typical boomtown.</i>

09:22.750 --> 09:24.667
<i> But it was hard</i>
<i> to get there.</i>

09:24.667 --> 09:26.208
There was not a train
that came to town.

09:26.208 --> 09:29.083
You had to go from train
to stagecoach or wagon.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.792
Narrator:
<i> Stagecoaches carry</i>

09:32.792 --> 09:34.750
<i> thousands of dollars</i>
<i> worth of silver</i>

09:34.750 --> 09:38.792
<i> from Tombstone mines</i>
<i> to the nearest railroad head,</i>

09:38.834 --> 09:41.001
<i> making them prime targets</i>
<i> for criminals</i>

09:41.001 --> 09:44.500
<i> looking to make</i>
<i> a quick score.</i>

09:44.500 --> 09:46.083
Kirschner:
<i> You'd have a driver,</i>

09:46.083 --> 09:47.667
<i> and then you'd have</i>
<i> a shotgun driver</i>

09:47.667 --> 09:49.667
sitting right there
with a shotgun

09:49.667 --> 09:52.667
ready to take on
whoever there was.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.208
<i> But despite all of that,</i>

09:54.208 --> 09:57.208
<i> the stagecoaches</i>
<i> were sometimes ambushed.</i>

09:57.250 --> 09:59.709
<i> Sometimes there were deaths.</i>

10:05.667 --> 10:07.083
Narrator:
<i> Looking for a solution,</i>

10:07.125 --> 10:11.792
<i> local businesses</i>
<i> turn to Wyatt Earp for help.</i>

10:11.792 --> 10:14.125
Collier:
<i> Wyatt was the right lawman</i>
<i> for Tombstone</i>

10:14.166 --> 10:17.834
because of his background
in the Kansas cow towns.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.333
<i> He understood cowboys</i>

10:19.333 --> 10:21.709
<i> and he understood</i>
<i> how they acted.</i>

10:21.709 --> 10:24.125
<i> And he could read</i>
<i> the warning signs</i>
<i> before they came.</i>

10:24.125 --> 10:27.250
So it just happened
to be the perfect storm

10:27.250 --> 10:28.667
when he came to Tombstone.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.291
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt Earp is appointed</i>

10:33.291 --> 10:36.333
<i> deputy sheriff of Tombstone</i>

10:36.333 --> 10:38.208
<i> and, with the help</i>
<i> of his brothers,</i>

10:38.208 --> 10:42.208
<i> begins making an impact</i>
<i> in the lawless boomtown.</i>

10:45.083 --> 10:47.083
Jeff Morey:
<i> As deputy sheriff</i>
<i> in Tombstone,</i>

10:47.083 --> 10:49.125
he's remarkably effective.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.959
He trails killers,
he makes numerous arrests.

10:51.959 --> 10:54.041
<i> Men don't escape</i>
<i> from his jail.</i>

10:54.041 --> 10:59.041
<i> Wyatt took that</i>
<i> law enforcement responsibility</i>
<i> very seriously.</i>

11:03.375 --> 11:05.834
Narrator:
<i> In the spring of 1881,</i>

11:05.834 --> 11:08.208
<i> Wyatt gets</i>
<i> his biggest case yet...</i>

11:10.250 --> 11:13.166
<i> when a stagecoach robbery</i>
<i> outside Tombstone</i>

11:13.166 --> 11:15.917
<i> leaves two men dead.</i>

11:15.917 --> 11:19.417
When a robbery, such as
the spectacular robbery

11:19.417 --> 11:23.417
of a stagecoach going from
Benson to Tombstone occurred,

11:23.417 --> 11:25.208
it was really a big deal.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.250
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt Earp doesn't realize</i>

11:29.250 --> 11:31.875
<i> that he's just walked in</i>
<i> on a case</i>

11:31.875 --> 11:35.250
<i> that will cement his place</i>
<i> in western mythology...</i>

11:40.166 --> 11:44.166
<i> and turn him from a lawman</i>
<i> into an outlaw.</i>

12:21.375 --> 12:24.166
Looks like there
were three of them.

12:24.166 --> 12:27.083
Maybe more.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.125
<i>Didn't stick around long.</i>

12:46.166 --> 12:48.125
They didn't even get
a shot off.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.041
Who do you think did it?

13:04.083 --> 13:05.375
I don't know...

13:06.291 --> 13:09.125
but I know
who probably does.

13:11.458 --> 13:15.041
Kirschner:
<i> There was $25,000 worth</i>
<i> of silver onboard</i>

13:15.041 --> 13:19.125
that was gonna be used
for currency in Tombstone.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.417
<i> Wells Fargo put out</i>

13:20.417 --> 13:22.333
<i> a very large reward</i>

13:22.333 --> 13:24.250
<i> to find the perpetrators.</i>

13:26.834 --> 13:30.333
Narrator:
<i> Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp</i>
<i> knows that in Tombstone</i>

13:30.333 --> 13:34.166
<i> there's only one group</i>
<i> capable of an act like this--</i>

13:34.166 --> 13:37.125
<i> the ruthless gang</i>
<i> of outlaws known as</i>

13:37.125 --> 13:39.834
<i> "the Cochise Cowboys."</i>

13:41.458 --> 13:43.458
<i> The Cochise Cowboys</i>
<i> are made up</i>

13:43.458 --> 13:47.542
<i> of nearly 300 cattle rustlers,</i>
<i> smugglers and bandits</i>

13:47.583 --> 13:51.250
<i> spread out across</i>
<i> the Arizona territory</i>

13:51.250 --> 13:53.583
<i> who have developed</i>
<i> a notorious reputation</i>

13:53.583 --> 13:55.792
<i> across the country.</i>

13:55.792 --> 13:59.125
Kirschner:
<i> The Cowboys were known</i>
<i> for their hotheadedness.</i>

13:59.125 --> 14:01.375
They were a pretty bad lot.

14:04.291 --> 14:07.208
Narrator:
<i> One of the most well-known</i>
<i> of the Cowboys</i>

14:07.208 --> 14:09.542
<i> is a man named</i>
<i> Ike Clanton.</i>

14:10.500 --> 14:12.291
Ike Clanton's
a one-man riot.

14:12.291 --> 14:15.001
<i> He was a notorious man.</i>

14:15.001 --> 14:17.375
<i> Not a man you wanted</i>
<i> to offend.</i>

14:29.250 --> 14:31.500
There better be
a good reason I'm here.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.875
It all depends
on you, Ike.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.917
There was
a stagecoach robbery
a few days back.

14:41.917 --> 14:44.166
<i> Two men are dead.</i>

14:44.166 --> 14:48.000
Judging by the tracks,
I'd say there were three men.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.250
You think I did it?

14:51.917 --> 14:54.041
No. Wells Fargo
is offering

14:54.041 --> 14:57.875
a $3,600 reward
for their arrest.

14:59.208 --> 15:02.166
You give me
the three names,

15:02.166 --> 15:05.083
I'll give you
the $3,600.

15:06.333 --> 15:09.250
If anyone
were to find out...

15:09.250 --> 15:10.875
and I mean<i> anyone...</i>

15:10.875 --> 15:12.375
No one will find out.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.083
I give you my word.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.500
Leonard, Head, and Crane.

15:33.083 --> 15:36.375
Narrator:
<i> Armed with names of the men</i>
<i> responsible for the robbery,</i>

15:36.375 --> 15:39.917
<i> Wyatt Earp sets off</i>
<i> to track them down.</i>

15:43.208 --> 15:46.917
<i> Four hundred miles away...</i>

15:46.917 --> 15:49.208
<i> Lincoln County Sheriff</i>
<i> Pat Garrett</i>

15:49.208 --> 15:52.125
<i> is about to begin</i>
<i> a manhunt of his own.</i>

16:16.667 --> 16:18.583
Where the hell
did Billy get the guns?

16:20.917 --> 16:23.291
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i> Pat Garrett has two reactions</i>

16:23.291 --> 16:27.125
<i> when he sees</i>
<i> this horrible jailbreak--</i>

16:27.125 --> 16:29.083
one reaction
is tremendous anger.

16:31.500 --> 16:35.208
<i> Another reaction</i>
<i> is tremendous guilt.</i>

16:35.208 --> 16:38.458
<i> Pat Garrett knew</i>
<i> Billy was ruthless</i>

16:38.458 --> 16:41.208
and would stop at nothing
to escape.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.041
I think he felt like
he was partly responsible

16:45.041 --> 16:46.250
for those murders.

16:49.458 --> 16:52.166
Catron:
<i> How do you think it is</i>
<i> that you got elected sheriff</i>

16:52.166 --> 16:54.291
of Lincoln County?

16:55.959 --> 16:58.041
Because you're
a popular man?

17:00.166 --> 17:03.166
Some kind of
great success?

17:06.542 --> 17:09.375
People of Lincoln County
didn't elect you, Sheriff...

17:13.291 --> 17:14.959
I did.

17:14.959 --> 17:18.166
I found him once,
I'll find him again.

17:19.458 --> 17:22.125
Try not to lose him
this time.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.625
Trust me, I won't.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Narrator:
<i> Prominent businessman</i>
<i> Thomas Catron knows</i>

17:33.000 --> 17:35.500
<i> in order for business</i>
<i> to grow in the West,</i>

17:35.500 --> 17:38.083
<i> he needs to stop</i>
<i> Billy the Kid</i>

17:38.083 --> 17:40.166
<i> once and for all.</i>

17:44.625 --> 17:49.125
<i> And this time Pat Garrett's</i>
<i> not taking any chances,</i>

17:49.125 --> 17:51.500
<i> because he's not</i>
<i> out to arrest Billy,</i>

17:51.500 --> 17:54.083
<i> he's out to kill him.</i>

18:12.583 --> 18:15.667
Narrator:
<i> After Jesse James'</i>
<i> first train robbery</i>

18:15.667 --> 18:17.375
<i> in three years</i>
<i> is a failure,</i>

18:17.375 --> 18:19.667
<i> he knows he needs</i>
<i> to make some changes</i>

18:19.667 --> 18:24.041
<i> if he's going to continue</i>
<i> his life of crime.</i>

18:24.083 --> 18:27.500
Eisenbach:
<i> With Jesse James,</i>
<i> it's like all these movies.</i>

18:27.500 --> 18:29.500
<i> These guys</i>
<i> go into retirement,</i>

18:29.500 --> 18:31.417
they need a little money,
and they're like,

18:31.417 --> 18:33.417
"Oh, one more job."

18:33.625 --> 18:36.291
That is Jesse James.

18:36.291 --> 18:37.667
The train's gonna come
around a nice tight bend,

18:37.667 --> 18:39.542
then it goes up a ridge,
which is nice,

18:39.542 --> 18:41.625
'cause it's gotta slow down
considerable right here.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.083
That's gonna give us
the time we need.

18:44.083 --> 18:47.458
Narrator:
<i> Jesse begins picking</i>
<i> his targets more carefully</i>

18:47.458 --> 18:49.375
<i> and hires a new gang member</i>
<i> to help him</i>

18:49.375 --> 18:51.375
<i> pull off the heist--</i>

18:51.375 --> 18:54.333
<i> fellow Missourian</i>
<i> Charley Ford.</i>

18:54.333 --> 18:56.542
There's something about
Charley Ford that Jesse liked.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.333
I don't know what it was.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.125
And Charley Ford liked Jesse.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.667
Ed Harris:
<i> There was a certain</i>
<i> code of honor.</i>

19:04.667 --> 19:06.375
I think a certain loyalty
was probably built

19:06.375 --> 19:08.542
into a lot
of relationships,

19:08.542 --> 19:10.667
<i> because you really</i>
<i> needed to have somebody</i>
<i> watching your back,</i>

19:10.667 --> 19:12.583
<i> you know,</i>
<i> somebody you could trust.</i>

19:16.792 --> 19:18.458
You stay in your seats,
and you will have

19:18.458 --> 19:20.834
a nice story
to tell your friends.

19:20.834 --> 19:23.083
<i> Get up, move around,</i>

19:23.083 --> 19:25.291
<i> and you probably</i>
<i> will not be talking to them.</i>

19:25.333 --> 19:28.417
Narrator:
<i> After a string</i>
<i> of successful robberies,</i>

19:28.417 --> 19:30.709
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> reestablishes himself</i>

19:30.709 --> 19:34.583
<i> as one of the most</i>
<i> dangerous criminals</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

19:46.291 --> 19:49.250
What did I tell you
about bringing strangers
around here?

19:49.250 --> 19:51.583
This is my brother Robert,
the one I told you about.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.125
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.417
How old are you?

19:56.417 --> 19:58.417
Twenty,
nearly twenty.

19:58.417 --> 20:01.458
How many men
you killed?

20:01.458 --> 20:05.625
I'm asking you,
not your brother.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.291
None.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.208
I got no use
for him.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.542
Jesse, he's my brother.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.709
I-I trust him
more than anyone
I know.

20:29.291 --> 20:31.166
We're low on whiskey.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.166
Did you hear
what I just said?

20:44.166 --> 20:45.667
Jesse needs
an extra man

20:45.667 --> 20:49.333
because he has
a bank robbery planned
in Platte City.

20:49.333 --> 20:53.333
<i> So he's willing to accept</i>
<i> this young Bob Ford,</i>

20:53.333 --> 20:55.500
who's Charley's brother,
'cause Jesse liked Charley Ford,

20:55.500 --> 20:59.250
and I'm sure that
Charley vouched for Bob.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.709
Narrator:
<i> With another gang member</i>
<i> on board,</i>

21:01.709 --> 21:05.500
<i> Jesse James starts planning</i>
<i> his next heist.</i>

21:07.291 --> 21:09.875
<i> Over a thousand miles</i>
<i> to the west,</i>

21:09.875 --> 21:14.750
<i> one man continues</i>
<i> to crack down on crime</i>
<i> in his town.</i>

21:18.625 --> 21:20.458
<i> For the past four months,</i>

21:20.458 --> 21:23.792
<i> Wyatt Earp and his brothers</i>
<i> Virgil and Morgan</i>

21:23.792 --> 21:25.792
<i> have been on the hunt</i>
<i> for three outlaws</i>

21:25.792 --> 21:30.001
<i> involved in a deadly</i>
<i> stagecoach robbery.</i>

21:30.001 --> 21:32.375
<i> But to catch the men,</i>

21:32.375 --> 21:35.000
<i> Wyatt has brought in</i>
<i> more muscle...</i>

21:36.750 --> 21:38.625
Two for me, Wyatt.

21:38.625 --> 21:41.709
<i> ...a famed gambler</i>
<i> and notorious gunman</i>

21:41.709 --> 21:43.417
<i> named Doc Holliday.</i>

21:45.875 --> 21:49.792
- Oh, boy.
- My heart's broken.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.625
Kirschner:
<i> Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp</i>

21:51.625 --> 21:53.417
<i> met in Dodge City.</i>

21:53.417 --> 21:54.875
<i> They had been friends</i>
<i> for a long time.</i>

21:54.875 --> 21:58.625
So Doc turns up
in Tombstone as well

21:58.625 --> 22:00.792
and was very close
to the Earps.

22:02.291 --> 22:03.667
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt plans to ride out</i>

22:03.667 --> 22:05.083
<i> with Doc and his brothers</i>

22:05.083 --> 22:07.792
<i> to confront the men</i>
<i> responsible.</i>

22:13.542 --> 22:17.500
<i> But before Wyatt</i>
<i> can take them down,</i>

22:17.500 --> 22:20.834
<i> the three suspects</i>
<i> turn up dead.</i>

22:21.917 --> 22:24.834
Kirschner:
<i> Wyatt wanted to</i>
<i> solve the murders,</i>

22:24.834 --> 22:28.583
only the perpetrators
got caught in another showdown

22:28.583 --> 22:31.417
<i> and were killed.</i>

22:31.417 --> 22:33.542
Narrator:
<i> With the suspects dead,</i>

22:33.542 --> 22:37.000
<i> in Wyatt's mind,</i>
<i> the case is closed.</i>

22:41.792 --> 22:43.083
All right, boys,
poker's the game.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.917
$10 to get in.

22:50.542 --> 22:52.500
What can I
do ya for, Morgan?

22:52.500 --> 22:55.417
All right,
I'll take two.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.583
Damn it, I fold.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.917
Surprise, surprise.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.875
We need to talk.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.000
What do you want?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.166
I gave you three names.

23:33.542 --> 23:36.834
I want my $3,600.

23:37.542 --> 23:40.001
The $3,600

23:40.001 --> 23:42.750
was for the reward.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.542
The three names you gave me
wound up dead.

23:46.917 --> 23:50.583
I took a big risk
giving up those names.

23:50.583 --> 23:51.959
I know you did.

23:53.667 --> 23:56.500
If I had the money,
I'd give it to you.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.959
But I don't.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.625
That's not my problem.

24:03.583 --> 24:04.917
It's not mine, either.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.834
I told you
don't cross me!

24:07.834 --> 24:10.000
I heard you
the first time.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.917
I think we both know
you're not gonna do

24:12.917 --> 24:15.166
a damn thing about it.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.583
Get the hell outta here.

24:29.750 --> 24:31.583
Kirschner:
<i> Ike was caught in the middle.</i>

24:31.875 --> 24:34.709
And he was afraid
that if anybody knew

24:34.709 --> 24:36.959
that he had this deal
with Wyatt Earp,

24:36.959 --> 24:39.166
his name would be mud,

24:39.166 --> 24:42.667
<i> because loyalty was everything</i>
<i> at the frontier.</i>

24:44.959 --> 24:49.041
Narrator:
<i> With Ike Clanton looking</i>
<i> to make good on his threat,</i>

24:49.041 --> 24:51.375
<i> Wyatt Earp realizes</i>

24:51.375 --> 24:53.750
<i> he's made a new enemy</i>
<i> in Tombstone.</i>

24:53.750 --> 24:55.709
Shall we resume, boys?

25:12.750 --> 25:15.001
Narrator:
<i> For the last four years,</i>

25:15.000 --> 25:17.834
<i> Lakota leader Sitting Bull</i>
<i> and his people</i>

25:17.834 --> 25:21.458
<i> have been following</i>
<i> the northern buffalo herd</i>
<i> in Canada</i>

25:21.458 --> 25:23.458
<i> after being forced</i>
<i> from their native lands</i>

25:23.458 --> 25:25.500
<i> in the United States.</i>

25:30.250 --> 25:32.250
<i> Following the death</i>
<i> of Crazy Horse</i>

25:32.250 --> 25:34.750
<i> at the hands</i>
<i> of the U.S. Army,</i>

25:34.750 --> 25:39.500
<i> Sitting Bull is one</i>
<i> of the few remaining leaders</i>
<i> of the Lakota.</i>

25:44.250 --> 25:46.959
<i> And now,</i>
<i> after a brutal winter,</i>

25:46.959 --> 25:50.542
<i> his people</i>
<i> are facing a crisis.</i>

25:50.542 --> 25:53.583
( speaking
native language )

26:25.667 --> 26:28.834
<i> Sitting Bull</i>
<i> realizes he has no choice</i>

26:28.834 --> 26:31.917
<i> but to lead his people</i>
<i> back to America...</i>

26:33.583 --> 26:36.166
<i> and agree to live</i>
<i> on the reservation.</i>

26:37.917 --> 26:40.542
Larry Pourier:
<i> I just feel like</i>
<i> he had to have known</i>

26:40.542 --> 26:43.625
<i> this isn't gonna</i>
<i> get better.</i>

26:43.625 --> 26:46.709
<i> Any respectful man</i>
<i> who loves his wife</i>
<i> and his children,</i>

26:46.709 --> 26:48.333
that's what
they're gonna do.

26:53.542 --> 26:56.250
Narrator:
<i> Upon his arrival</i>
<i> to the U.S.,</i>

26:56.250 --> 26:58.709
<i> Sitting Bull,</i>
<i> like thousands of Indians,</i>

26:58.709 --> 27:02.291
<i> is forced to assimilate</i>
<i> to the white man's ways.</i>

27:06.250 --> 27:09.208
Pourier:
<i> He was adjusting</i>
<i> to the reservation life,</i>

27:09.208 --> 27:11.625
not that he liked it,

27:11.625 --> 27:16.000
but there was a certain
acceptance, I guess.

27:17.250 --> 27:20.875
<i> I don't think anyone</i>
<i> that was born in a teepee,</i>

27:20.875 --> 27:23.750
that was living
the last part of their life
on a reservation--

27:23.750 --> 27:26.083
I don't know how anyone
could've been happy.

27:34.834 --> 27:36.333
Narrator:
<i> Knowing that things</i>
<i> would never go back</i>

27:36.375 --> 27:38.917
<i> to the way they were,</i>

27:38.917 --> 27:41.250
<i> Sitting Bull believes</i>
<i> there may be one way</i>

27:41.250 --> 27:44.166
<i> to preserve</i>
<i> some of the Lakota culture.</i>

27:51.917 --> 27:56.250
<i> In 1885, Sitting Bull</i>
<i> leaves his reservation</i>

27:56.291 --> 28:00.083
<i> to join Buffalo Bill Cody's</i>
<i> famous Wild West Show.</i>

28:06.834 --> 28:11.001
Andrew Isenberg:
<i> Buffalo Bill started</i>
<i> portraying himself onstage.</i>

28:11.001 --> 28:13.834
<i> It was kind of</i>
<i> a combination of a rodeo</i>

28:13.834 --> 28:15.917
<i> and performances.</i>

28:18.083 --> 28:20.750
And one
of the very savvy things

28:20.750 --> 28:23.709
that Buffalo Bill did
was that he would bring

28:23.709 --> 28:26.001
<i> real Native Americans along</i>
<i> in the show</i>

28:26.001 --> 28:27.792
<i> and they would perform,</i>

28:27.792 --> 28:30.375
<i> and they would kind of</i>
<i> reenact battles.</i>

28:34.375 --> 28:37.792
It was wildly popular
in the 1880s and 1890s
in the United States.

28:41.166 --> 28:42.667
Karl Jacoby:
<i> Why would someone</i>
<i> like Sitting Bull</i>

28:42.667 --> 28:46.208
<i> agree to join</i>
<i> the Wild West Show?</i>

28:46.208 --> 28:50.208
There seems to have been
a couple of reasons for this.

28:50.208 --> 28:53.000
<i> For a lot of the Lakota</i>
<i> who are on the reservations,</i>

28:53.041 --> 28:55.291
they're being exposed
to these tremendous efforts

28:55.291 --> 28:57.291
to Americanize them, right?

28:57.291 --> 28:59.333
<i> To destroy their culture.</i>

28:59.333 --> 29:01.250
<i> The Wild West Show</i>
<i> is one of the few ways</i>

29:01.250 --> 29:03.208
<i> that they can</i>
<i> actually maintain</i>

29:03.208 --> 29:06.417
<i> at least a fragment</i>
<i> of traditional culture</i>

29:06.417 --> 29:09.291
and demonstrate their skill
as horsemen

29:09.291 --> 29:12.000
<i> and their skill and bravery</i>
<i> as warriors.</i>

29:15.709 --> 29:20.291
Narrator:
<i> While Sitting Bull</i>
<i> begins touring the country...</i>

29:20.291 --> 29:22.000
<i> another legend of the West</i>

29:22.000 --> 29:24.417
<i> is gaining notoriety</i>
<i> once again.</i>

29:26.834 --> 29:31.208
My name is Jesse James,
and I trust you know who I am.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.291
Narrator:
<i> With a new gang</i>
<i> by his side,</i>

29:33.291 --> 29:35.458
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> has successfully pulled off</i>

29:35.458 --> 29:38.041
<i> a series of train heists.</i>

29:38.041 --> 29:43.208
<i> But his actions are gaining</i>
<i> more attention than ever.</i>

29:43.208 --> 29:46.875
Gardner:
<i>For Missouri, for the governors</i>
<i> and for the bankers,</i>

29:46.917 --> 29:50.417
it's not good
when people call your state
the Robber State.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.375
<i> That doesn't really</i>
<i> recruit business.</i>

29:52.375 --> 29:55.083
<i> That doesn't recruit</i>
<i> land buyers.</i>

29:55.083 --> 29:58.250
<i> It's a stain</i>
<i> on your state.</i>

29:58.250 --> 30:02.125
So they want
to get beyond that.

30:02.125 --> 30:03.834
Narrator:
<i> The railroad companies</i>

30:03.834 --> 30:05.834
<i> reach out</i>
<i> to the governor of Missouri</i>

30:05.834 --> 30:08.125
<i> to put an end</i>
<i> to Jesse's spree,</i>

30:08.125 --> 30:12.083
<i> offering a $5,000 reward</i>
<i> for his capture.</i>

30:30.917 --> 30:34.000
You wanna explain to me what
in the hell took you so long?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.166
We came as quick
as we could.

30:40.166 --> 30:41.417
Anybody see you?

30:41.792 --> 30:43.125
No. No-- no one.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.375
Sit down.

30:46.375 --> 30:49.125
Narrator:
<i> With a new bounty</i>
<i> on his head,</i>

30:49.125 --> 30:51.917
<i> Jesse goes into hiding.</i>

30:51.917 --> 30:55.166
<i> And he knows if he's going</i>
<i> to stay away from the law,</i>

30:55.166 --> 30:59.333
<i> he needs to keep</i>
<i> his two newest gang members</i>
<i> close to him.</i>

30:59.333 --> 31:03.959
Jesse was the most paranoid
of any of the gang members.

31:05.917 --> 31:07.375
<i> He'd become very suspicious,</i>

31:07.417 --> 31:10.125
and you can't really
blame him.

31:10.125 --> 31:12.125
<i> I think that</i>
<i> the Ford boys,</i>

31:12.125 --> 31:14.417
<i> he could keep</i>
<i> an eye on them</i>
<i> and make sure</i>

31:14.458 --> 31:17.458
<i> that everything is normal,</i>
<i> the way it should be.</i>

31:22.333 --> 31:24.583
All right, this bounty
that's on my head,

31:24.583 --> 31:26.875
it's now on
all of our heads.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.417
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

31:31.417 --> 31:33.001
I understand.

31:33.001 --> 31:34.375
Yeah.

31:38.083 --> 31:42.041
Narrator:
<i> As a man with</i>
<i> a price on his head,</i>

31:42.041 --> 31:44.917
<i> it's becoming hard</i>
<i> for Jesse to tell</i>

31:44.917 --> 31:46.959
<i> who he can trust.</i>

31:55.959 --> 31:58.000
<i> ( patrons chattering )</i>

32:01.375 --> 32:03.375
Narrator:
<i> After escaping jail,</i>

32:03.375 --> 32:06.375
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> is enjoying life</i>

32:06.375 --> 32:08.001
<i> as a fugitive.</i>

32:08.001 --> 32:11.291
He never, ever for a second
thought he was gonna be caught.

32:11.291 --> 32:13.000
And if he was caught,
what would he do?

32:13.041 --> 32:15.208
He would escape, because
he was always escaping.

32:15.208 --> 32:17.500
<i> And he had a sense</i>
<i> that he had a charmed life</i>

32:17.500 --> 32:20.542
<i> and that there was nothing</i>
<i> that could ever touch him,</i>

32:20.542 --> 32:23.001
and, you know,
he's 20 years old.

32:23.001 --> 32:25.166
I mean, he's got
that sense of immortality.

32:28.375 --> 32:31.041
Gardner:
<i> Every friend he encounters</i>
<i> tells him,</i>

32:31.041 --> 32:34.542
"Billy, Pat Garrett
is a different kind of sheriff.

32:34.542 --> 32:38.000
He is not going to stop
hunting you.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.959
You can flee now,
go to Mexico.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.542
Nobody's gonna look
for you in Mexico.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.000
Get out of the territory."

32:44.000 --> 32:46.333
<i> But he insisted on staying</i>
<i> in that Fort Sumner area,</i>

32:46.333 --> 32:48.333
<i> that part of</i>
<i> eastern New Mexico.</i>

32:54.583 --> 32:57.125
Narrator:
<i> But what Billy</i>
<i> doesn't realize</i>

32:57.125 --> 33:00.041
<i> is that Lincoln County</i>
<i> Sheriff Pat Garrett</i>

33:00.041 --> 33:03.250
<i> has been tracking him</i>
<i> for the last three months.</i>

33:03.250 --> 33:05.458
The killing of two deputies
changes everything,

33:05.458 --> 33:08.041
and Garrett engages

33:08.041 --> 33:11.417
in a massive manhunt
for Billy the Kid.

33:14.041 --> 33:17.333
Narrator:
<i>After hearing rumors that Billy</i>
<i> may be in Fort Sumner,</i>

33:17.333 --> 33:20.208
<i> Pat Garrett uses</i>
<i> his knowledge of the land</i>

33:20.208 --> 33:24.208
<i> to track the young outlaw</i>
<i> to a ranch outside of town.</i>

33:24.208 --> 33:27.542
Stay here.
I'm gonna go look around.

33:30.125 --> 33:31.625
You know,
for the average citizen,

33:31.625 --> 33:34.333
Billy the Kid
is very horrifying--

33:34.333 --> 33:36.542
I mean,
that he's on the loose,

33:36.542 --> 33:40.375
<i> so there's tremendous pressure</i>
<i> on Pat Garrett as the sheriff</i>

33:40.375 --> 33:44.208
<i> to get Billy, kill him,</i>
<i> capture him, get it done.</i>

34:00.375 --> 34:03.166
Hutton:
<i> Billy the Kid's</i>
<i> just incredibly charming,</i>

34:03.166 --> 34:06.291
but he's also deadly,
and he can just turn on a dime.

34:06.291 --> 34:10.500
<i> And that smile could fade</i>
<i>and that pistol would come out.</i>

34:58.083 --> 35:00.667
<i>Qué es?</i>

35:00.667 --> 35:02.375
Who's there?

35:37.291 --> 35:41.458
Narrator:
<i> Billy the Kid is dead</i>
<i> at 21 years old.</i>

35:55.375 --> 35:58.667
<i> But in death,</i>
<i> a kid from New York City</i>

35:58.667 --> 36:01.709
<i> becomes a legend</i>
<i> of the American West.</i>

36:05.333 --> 36:08.125
Eisenbach:
<i> Billy the Kid is just that--</i>
<i> he was a kid.</i>

36:08.125 --> 36:10.917
He was a kid
caught up in something

36:10.917 --> 36:15.250
that he couldn't control,
without any deeper ambition

36:15.250 --> 36:16.834
than just to survive

36:16.834 --> 36:19.291
in this jungle.

36:19.792 --> 36:22.667
Gardner:
<i> Billy lived in</i>
<i> a very, very violent world.</i>

36:22.667 --> 36:26.500
And the way he responded
was sensational.

36:26.500 --> 36:30.333
And then the way he died
made him legendary.

36:32.667 --> 36:36.208
Chamberlain:
<i> The newspapers</i>
<i> pick up on the story.</i>

36:36.208 --> 36:38.458
<i> There are books</i>
<i> written about him.</i>

36:40.542 --> 36:42.792
<i> He became what he did</i>

36:42.792 --> 36:47.250
because he embodies
the idea of freedom.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.250
Sutherland:
<i> When you take a look</i>
<i> at the dime novels</i>

36:53.250 --> 36:54.709
<i> that were so successful</i>
<i> back East,</i>

36:54.709 --> 36:56.667
it was always the David
against the Goliath

36:56.667 --> 36:58.667
that was the most exciting.

36:58.667 --> 37:01.458
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> was so attractive</i>
<i> in that context.</i>

37:01.458 --> 37:05.291
<i> Here was this very small,</i>
<i> you know, unassuming kid.</i>

37:05.291 --> 37:07.542
But if you tried
to take advantage of him,
you'd pay for it.

37:07.542 --> 37:10.375
<i> And there was</i>
<i> a great romance in that.</i>

37:17.542 --> 37:21.583
Narrator:
<i> The death of Billy the Kid</i>
<i> marks the end of an era.</i>

37:22.709 --> 37:26.375
<i> But while one ruthless outlaw</i>
<i> may be gone,</i>

37:26.375 --> 37:29.625
<i> the violence in the West</i>
<i> is far from over.</i>

37:57.542 --> 38:00.375
Narrator:
<i> After Wyatt Earp</i>
<i> refuses to give Ike Clanton</i>

38:00.375 --> 38:02.333
<i> a $3,600 bounty...</i>

38:05.291 --> 38:08.375
<i> the notorious cowboy</i>
<i> is out for revenge.</i>

38:11.583 --> 38:13.750
You're a dead man, Earp!

38:14.750 --> 38:16.750
Wyatt!

38:18.375 --> 38:19.792
You're a dead man!

38:22.667 --> 38:24.834
Collier:
<i> Ike Clanton</i>
<i> is not happy with Earp.</i>

38:27.750 --> 38:29.834
So he walked around
that morning pretty much
letting everybody know

38:29.834 --> 38:31.834
<i> that he was going</i>
<i> to kill them.</i>

38:36.291 --> 38:37.792
Virgil!

38:39.375 --> 38:40.917
Morgan!

38:42.333 --> 38:43.875
You're dead men!

38:55.000 --> 38:56.959
Narrator:
<i> To back up his threats,</i>

38:58.583 --> 39:01.917
<i> Clanton enlists the help</i>
<i> of his fellow gang members.</i>

39:13.458 --> 39:16.709
It's Ike.
He's in town.

39:16.709 --> 39:18.583
Wyatt, he's drunker
than hell.

39:18.583 --> 39:20.500
Going around telling everyone
he's coming to kill you

39:20.500 --> 39:22.375
<i> and your brothers.</i>

39:25.375 --> 39:26.709
Where's he at?

39:26.709 --> 39:28.875
Last place I saw him
was over on Fremont.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.375
Does he have
anyone else with him?

39:34.333 --> 39:35.709
Four, maybe five guys.

39:39.709 --> 39:42.625
Collier:
<i> There was a lot</i>
<i> of anxiety and tension.</i>

39:42.625 --> 39:44.917
<i> And it was brewing,</i>
<i> you could feel it.</i>

39:44.917 --> 39:46.667
You knew something
was gonna happen.

39:46.667 --> 39:48.667
You knew something
was going down that day.

39:56.625 --> 39:59.834
Narrator:
<i> By bringing their guns</i>
<i> into Tombstone,</i>

39:59.834 --> 40:03.041
<i> Clanton's gang knows</i>
<i> they are provoking a fight.</i>

40:08.750 --> 40:10.542
What do you want
to do, Wyatt?

40:12.792 --> 40:14.792
Go get me Doc Holliday.

40:14.792 --> 40:16.000
Yes, sir.

40:44.667 --> 40:47.001
Isenberg:
<i> Ike Clanton has been</i>
<i> talking all around town</i>

40:47.001 --> 40:49.500
<i> about what they're</i>
<i> gonna do to Wyatt.</i>

40:52.417 --> 40:55.500
<i> The Earps make the decision</i>
<i> to walk down there</i>

40:55.500 --> 40:56.875
and confront these guys.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.000
<i> The way to understand men</i>
<i> in this period</i>

41:01.000 --> 41:03.500
<i> is an honor culture.</i>

41:03.500 --> 41:04.834
<i> You have to be willing</i>
<i> to meet</i>

41:04.834 --> 41:06.750
any challenge to your honor
with violence,

41:06.750 --> 41:08.917
<i> otherwise you're a coward.</i>

41:12.750 --> 41:17.417
Narrator:

Kirschner:
<i> The sight of</i>
<i> the three Earp brothers</i>

41:27.875 --> 41:31.667
and Doc Holliday marching down
the dusty streets of Tombstone

41:31.667 --> 41:35.542
<i> to confront the cowboys</i>
<i> at the O.K. Corral</i>

41:35.542 --> 41:38.083
has burned
into our mythology.

42:07.500 --> 42:08.750
Give us your guns.

42:14.750 --> 42:16.500
( clicks )

42:17.458 --> 42:18.792
Throw up your hands.

42:23.709 --> 42:26.125
I'm not gonna ask again.

42:30.917 --> 42:33.001
<i> ( gunfire )</i>
