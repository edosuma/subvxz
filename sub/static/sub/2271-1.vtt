        (woman panting)

00:33.801 --> 00:35.868
              ¶¶¶

01:03.230 --> 01:06.131
        (woman moaning)

02:27.648 --> 02:29.715
           (panting)

02:39.693 --> 02:43.028
           (giggling)

02:56.076 --> 02:58.076
                        - Hurry!

02:58.078 --> 03:00.245
                        Get him!

03:00.247 --> 03:03.148
                     Over there!

03:07.555 --> 03:10.289
                  Where are you?

03:22.603 --> 03:25.938
          Gotcha now.

03:27.875 --> 03:32.244
If you wanted to play house, all
     you had to do was ask.

03:37.651 --> 03:42.955
Haven't you ever
kissed a girl before?

03:42.957 --> 03:45.657
Aww, it's easy.

03:45.659 --> 03:49.595
All you do is close your eyes
and pucker up.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.097
Like this.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.248
           (laughing)

04:11.919 --> 04:13.919
             Mm-mm.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.488
                    We wanna see
              what's down there.

04:19.994 --> 04:23.328
              I'll show you mine
           if you show me yours.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.272
      Come on, lover boy.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.316
           (laughing)
           That's it?

04:44.318 --> 04:47.152
Looks like an acorn!

04:50.424 --> 04:53.425
            - Mmm...

04:53.427 --> 04:56.862
  - Hey, come back! Come back!

04:56.864 --> 05:00.599
     Come back, lover boy!

05:11.512 --> 05:14.212
         (door opening)

05:14.214 --> 05:16.281
       Bye! See you soon!

06:14.141 --> 06:17.743
        (twigs cracking)

06:20.581 --> 06:24.916
          (screaming)

06:27.788 --> 06:31.623
           (moaning)

06:36.730 --> 06:39.464
           (gasping)

06:39.466 --> 06:41.733
            Help...

06:41.735 --> 06:44.936
           Please...

06:51.178 --> 06:53.712
         Please help...

07:14.501 --> 07:17.235
       I'm sorry! What...

07:17.237 --> 07:19.538
         I was kidding.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.449
       No... No! Please!

07:30.451 --> 07:34.085
   I'll do whatever you want!
           I'm sorry!

07:34.087 --> 07:37.289
           Please...

07:37.291 --> 07:40.926
        I'm begging you,
        I'm begging you!

07:40.928 --> 07:43.728
        No, no, please!

07:43.730 --> 07:46.531
          (screaming)

07:46.533 --> 07:48.600
          (splashing)

07:59.646 --> 08:03.648
 (children's laughter echoing)

08:17.498 --> 08:20.866
       (messages binging)

09:19.993 --> 09:23.328
           (exhaling)

09:26.266 --> 09:28.833
           - ...Well?

09:32.372 --> 09:36.508
           (scoffing)
          "All right"?

09:36.510 --> 09:39.911
        Honey, this here
   is some Grade A prime rib.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.987
     We've been over this.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.323
     I don't have a choice.

09:51.325 --> 09:54.092
       - You could always
          sell drugs.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.761
   - Oh, my God, what are you...
       Go back to your computer,

09:56.763 --> 09:59.264
     I wasn't done with my show.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.533
  Uh, okay, then get in here and
 close the door, I'm buck naked.

10:01.535 --> 10:03.568
       - Well, you better
        get used to it.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.971
It is your new business attire.
     - Joke all you want,

10:05.973 --> 10:09.207
but it's either this
or drop out of school.

10:09.209 --> 10:13.044
 - I thought you said your mom
        could swing it?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.046
- The tuition and her mortgage?
           I mean...

10:15.048 --> 10:17.215
 - Not without my dad's income.
         Not for long.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.217
 - Well, breaking news for ya,

10:19.219 --> 10:21.319
      there are other ways
      a gal can earn cash

10:21.321 --> 10:24.656
 besides flashing her vertical
  smile all over cyberspace.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.225
          Look, Kylie,

10:27.227 --> 10:30.161
   you're better than this -

10:30.163 --> 10:33.565
            and I strongly doubt
         your dad would approve.

10:33.567 --> 10:37.168
All right, look; it's not
prostitution, or even stripping.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.538
There's no sleazy men slipping
singles into my g-string
while copping a feel.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.108
   - Yeah, but it's porn, Kylie!

10:43.110 --> 10:46.611
Technically. But it's not like
skanky <i> Boogie Nights</i> porn.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.680
I mean, it's just me
and a few unmanned cameras

10:48.682 --> 10:52.183
doing things I'd probably
be doing anyways.

10:52.185 --> 10:56.821
Metal and glass - that's all.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.823
    - And a whole wide world

10:58.825 --> 11:01.426
   of douchebags whacking off
       on the other side!

11:01.428 --> 11:03.695
       Ugh... I gotta go.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.798
         Have fun with
    your little nudie site.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.778
           (giggling)

11:19.780 --> 11:23.181
  -<i> My name's Mia. Welcome to</i>
    Girlhouse.<i> Come inside!</i>

11:31.425 --> 11:33.992
              ¶¶¶

11:37.330 --> 11:40.765
      (rock music playing)
        -<i> Come on, boys. </i>

11:40.767 --> 11:45.470
 <i> I'm so wet and ready for you.</i>
            (beep)

11:47.908 --> 11:51.943
           (moaning)
      -<i> Oh, yeah. Yeah... </i>

11:51.945 --> 11:54.846
          <i> Oh, oh...</i>

11:54.848 --> 11:57.849
          <i> Oh, mm...</i>

12:02.222 --> 12:04.522
        (phone ringing)

12:04.524 --> 12:07.325
    -<i> Hi, you've reached the</i>
   <i> voicemail of Linda Atkins,</i>

12:07.327 --> 12:09.327
   <i> please leave a message.</i>
            (beep)

12:09.329 --> 12:11.329
     - Hey, Mom, it's me.
    Great news... Um, I got

12:11.331 --> 12:14.999
  a part-time job working for
     one of my professors.

12:15.001 --> 12:18.903
It pays really well, so I'll be
 able to send you some money.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.006
    Also, I decided to move
 off campus with some friends.

12:22.008 --> 12:25.043
 It's way cheaper and way more
   spacious than the dorms.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.646
     Oh, yeah, and, wait,
     here's the best part:

12:28.648 --> 12:31.182
  I got this scholarship that
     begins next semester,

12:31.184 --> 12:33.184
       so you won't have
       to pay my tuition

12:33.186 --> 12:38.556
 from now on. I miss you, Mom.
        Talk soon. Bye.

12:38.558 --> 12:44.829
        - Kylie Atkins!
    What changed your mind?

12:44.831 --> 12:48.366
        - Got my eye on
      a new pair of shoes.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.741
  - (Gary): My detractors say
  I'm just some smut pedlar,

12:56.743 --> 13:00.512
  preying on the weaknesses of
      young women and men.

13:00.514 --> 13:02.814
       I say screw them.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.651
     The fact is, I'm one
     of the fastest-rising
   entrepreneurs in America.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.220
          I'm no pimp.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.790
      I'm the Hugh Hefner
     for the 21st century.

13:11.792 --> 13:16.694
     - Um, about the pay.
  Can I really expect to make

13:16.696 --> 13:18.897
      as much as you said?
           - Minimum.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.366
   Anything above base salary
         is up to you.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.702
We track every eyeball and every
 girl every second of the day.

13:24.704 --> 13:28.273
   You bring dollars, you get
   rewarded. Sky's the limit.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.775
            - Now...

13:30.777 --> 13:32.977
How do I make sure one of these
guys doesn't end up stalking me?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.979
      - Today,<i> Girlhouse </i>
      is the most secure,

13:34.981 --> 13:38.516
 technologically advanced site
         of its kind.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.386
 My team of top engineers work
       around the clock

13:41.388 --> 13:43.621
  from an untraceable location
           to ensure

13:43.623 --> 13:45.957
  that <i> Girlhouse</i> can never be
      tracked or hacked.

13:50.063 --> 13:54.632
     Team, say hi to Kylie.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.535
     - (all): <i> Hi to Kylie.</i>

13:57.537 --> 14:01.005
          - Bye, team.
     With this little baby,

14:01.007 --> 14:04.475
I can monitor and control every
   aspect of the site 24/7.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.477
     Cameras, microphones,

14:06.479 --> 14:09.414
 computers - I can block it all
   with the push of a button.

14:09.416 --> 14:13.318
   <i> Girlhouse</i> is pretty much
   the Fort Knox of websites.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.429
           (moaning)

14:24.431 --> 14:30.201
        - Um... How much
      of that is required?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.570
 - Uh, nothing's ever required.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.672
    Everything and everyone
     you do is up to you.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.444
  Look, when I approached you
   in the quad last spring,

14:39.446 --> 14:43.047
 it was because I could see you
     were someone special.

14:43.049 --> 14:46.317
         I knew you had
   what it takes to be a hit.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.129
          Here we are.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.365
        Home sweet home.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.901
           After you.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.081
             Steve.
        - (Steve): Gary.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.183
        - This is Kylie,
      our newest resident.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.185
          - Pleasure.
             - Hi.

15:21.187 --> 15:24.422
      - Steve and Big Mike
       oversea security.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.557
 Along with the perimeter wall
           out back,

15:26.559 --> 15:29.494
     they're our low-tech
     last line of defence.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.898
    - How often do you have
     to turn people away?

15:33.900 --> 15:36.768
- Uh, a few times a year
some college chump

15:36.770 --> 15:39.604
follows one of the girls home.
No big deal.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.440
 - Yeah. Especially when you're
   an ex-NC State linebacker.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.923
      (TV playing quietly)

16:07.834 --> 16:11.336
   - (TV): <i> Okay, so now we're</i>
    <i> at this nice state...</i>

16:11.338 --> 16:13.404
         - Shit, Gary!

16:13.406 --> 16:15.740
        You didn't say
      you were coming by!

16:15.742 --> 16:19.143
   - And that's Kat. She's...

16:19.145 --> 16:21.512
        Well, she's Kat.
        (door slamming)

16:24.884 --> 16:26.884
        Uh, we have over

16:26.886 --> 16:29.520
  50 cameras around the house.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.391
   I encourage you to utilize
      as many as you can.

16:33.393 --> 16:37.195
  - So, like, hundreds of guys
   are watching us right now?
          - Thousands,

16:37.197 --> 16:39.263
      at any given moment.

16:43.236 --> 16:47.805
     - Why do they want to watch
 all the boring stuff like this?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.974
    - well, it gives members
         the sensation

16:49.976 --> 16:52.010
of actually getting to know you.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.012
 - It's what makes us different
       from other sites.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.681
   - (Gary): There's our Kat.
 - These guys will fall in love

16:56.683 --> 16:58.683
  with you, 'cause they're not
     getting just the sex,

16:58.685 --> 17:00.852
        they're getting
       a full experience.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.987
        It's kinda like
       they live with us.

17:02.989 --> 17:06.457
       - Except each girl's full
 identity is always kept secret.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.127
    Members can never figure out
            where or who you are

17:09.128 --> 17:11.496
                   in real life,

17:11.498 --> 17:13.498
       and if some random viewer
             does recognize you,

17:13.500 --> 17:16.834
              we block or delete
    any attempt to broadcast it.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.305
   - Should we take the tour?

17:30.183 --> 17:32.750
         That's Devon,
      our main attraction.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.720
             Devon.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.489
This is Kylie, our new roommate.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.726
           (chuckles)

17:41.728 --> 17:44.529
         - A little on
 the wholesome side, eh, Gare?

17:44.531 --> 17:49.167
        Hope she doesn't
      devalue the product.

17:49.169 --> 17:53.137
- She thinks you're competition.
    Take it as a compliment.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.206
            Come on.

17:58.144 --> 18:01.712
            Okay...
           (knocking)

18:01.714 --> 18:04.248
     (loud music playing)
   That's Janet. She's doing

18:04.250 --> 18:06.884
a chat right now, probably with
 a bunch of millionaire execs.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.554
         She's big with
     the Fortune 500 crowd.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.756
    - That's 'cause I'm all
      business, bitches!

18:11.758 --> 18:14.125
 - This is Kylie, the new girl.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.328
    - Hey, girl. Okay, boys,

18:17.330 --> 18:20.031
 you wanna see my spreadsheet?

18:20.033 --> 18:22.133
           - Okay...

18:22.135 --> 18:25.069
       - Get that. Yeah!

18:25.071 --> 18:28.039
           (knocking)

18:28.041 --> 18:31.642
    This is Heather's room.
      She's the wild one.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.812
           (moaning)

18:34.814 --> 18:38.416
 Also the loudest in the sack.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.585
When she's knocking boots you're
      gonna hear about it.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.587
          Literally,
    the whole house shakes.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.823
      - Hey! Gare, thought
     I heard you out there.

18:45.825 --> 18:49.260
 - Hey, Heather, this is Kylie.
     - Hey, hun. Pleasure.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.963
Gare, you still owe me for that
  3-way last week, remember?

18:51.965 --> 18:55.199
- Oh, God, I'm sorry. I forgot.
    I'll get on that, okay?

18:55.201 --> 18:58.536
            - Okay.
          - All right.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.872
   Good luck, and live sexy.
      (Heather laughing)

19:00.874 --> 19:03.975
           Take care.
        (blowing kisses)

19:03.977 --> 19:06.277
- Okay, come on.

19:11.484 --> 19:16.087
   - Here it is. New girl always
           gets the third floor.

19:21.327 --> 19:26.097
        - It's perfect.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.366
        - Here you are.
            - Hey!

19:30.770 --> 19:33.404
         I missed you.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.773
      Kylie, this is Mia,

19:35.775 --> 19:39.377
         my girlfriend.
             - Hey.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.880
            - Hey.
     - I know, I know what
   you're probably thinking,

19:42.882 --> 19:45.449
  "How do they justify living
 here, doing this for all those

19:45.451 --> 19:48.019
 sleazy guys out there," but we
  don't look at it like that.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.288
The members may not necessarily
        be our fantasy,

19:50.290 --> 19:53.691
 but we definitely are theirs.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.195
      And they're not all
   creepy losers. You'll see.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.330
            Come on.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.399
              Bye!

20:20.753 --> 20:22.753
  - (Kylie): And you all go to
         Selby College?

20:22.755 --> 20:24.755
       - (Kat): Are you kidding?
  I dropped out when I found out

20:24.757 --> 20:27.024
     how much money I could make
          here. It's ridiculous.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.860
- Mm-hmm. No college for this
girl. Gary found me in Vegas.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.862
       - Stripping, or...
             - No.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.898
Making $5 foot-longs
at Subway.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.900
- Now she puts about 5
foot-longs in her subway

20:35.902 --> 20:38.569
          each week.
- Yeah, for a lot more than $5.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.072
      - (laughing): Yeah!
        (all laughing)

20:41.074 --> 20:45.076
 - (Devon): Yeah, I go to Selby,
but that's not where I met Gary.

20:45.078 --> 20:48.145
       I was in a bikini contest
                 in South Beach,

20:48.147 --> 20:51.382
    he was judging. I offered to
       blow him for first place.

20:51.384 --> 20:54.252
           - ...And?
  - I didn't realize there was

20:54.254 --> 20:57.521
                 a second judge,
           and I came in second.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.691
- (Janet): Okay, what about you?
What's your story?

21:00.693 --> 21:03.527
       - I'm from Topeka.
           - Mm-hmm.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.530
          - Siblings?
      - I'm an only child.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.200
   - What do your parents do?
    - My mom is a housewife.

21:09.202 --> 21:11.669
                   - Hmm, sweet.
            What about your dad?

21:11.671 --> 21:15.439
- He, um... He passed away.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.009
             - Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:18.011 --> 21:21.045
        Recently, or...
     - Like, 3 months ago.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.784
- But anyway, I'm really happy
to know about

21:26.786 --> 21:29.420
  the off-camera room. I might
 need to use the bathroom there

21:29.422 --> 21:31.756
 until I get more comfortable.
            - Yeah.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.758
   - (Heather): Some guys pay
     serious coin for that.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.826
             - Ew!
       - Shut, up, Devon,

21:35.828 --> 21:39.163
      you fucking love it.
- (Devon): Okay, ladies, ladies,

21:39.165 --> 21:42.867
    ladies, I think it's time...

21:42.869 --> 21:45.770
            - Oh...
       - (Kylie): Time...

21:45.772 --> 21:48.606
        - Time for what?
        - To get naked!

21:48.608 --> 21:50.608
  (all laughing and cheering)

21:50.610 --> 21:53.477
            (typing)

21:56.149 --> 21:59.383
    - Okay, boys. Here I am.

21:59.385 --> 22:02.653
      - Okay, remember -
  just you and your computer.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.504
      - No tricks, but...

22:20.506 --> 22:24.008
     ...maybe a few treats.

22:24.010 --> 22:34.118
              ¶¶¶

22:34.120 --> 22:44.729
              ¶¶¶

22:44.731 --> 22:46.797
 - ¶ Well, I've flown around ¶

22:48.901 --> 22:51.168
   ¶ Gone from town to town ¶

22:51.170 --> 22:54.071
        ¶ But I never ¶

22:57.009 --> 23:01.412
        ¶ I'd never met
       someone like you ¶

23:12.258 --> 23:14.492
           - I don't know, Gare.
It's a little junior high to me.

23:14.494 --> 23:18.295
   - Just give her a minute.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.542
   - (laughing): Oh, really?

23:31.544 --> 23:34.979
    Are you here for these?

23:34.981 --> 23:37.982
          (chuckling)

23:56.235 --> 24:02.807
      - Here we go, gang.

24:02.809 --> 24:06.777
 - ¶ Oh, the words that I sow ¶

24:08.881 --> 24:11.549
    ¶ They let it be known ¶

24:11.551 --> 24:14.618
         - Damn, girl!

24:14.620 --> 24:16.687
           Nice rack.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.632
             - Yes!

24:28.634 --> 24:30.935
  I knew this girl would kill.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.270
       - (woman): Jimmy,
       time for dinner.

24:33.272 --> 24:38.709
      - In a minute Mom,
      I'm doing homework.

24:41.314 --> 24:44.448
        (phone ringing)

25:10.810 --> 25:12.910
        - (Ben): Dude,
      clean up your shit.

25:12.912 --> 25:15.479
- Dude, dude, shut up. You gotta
 get in here and see this girl,

25:15.481 --> 25:17.448
     right now. Right now!
         - All right,

25:17.450 --> 25:19.517
 you can clean up later, then.

25:24.891 --> 25:27.157
                - Fuckin' way...

25:27.159 --> 25:29.927
        - I know, right?
         Hot as balls.

25:29.929 --> 25:33.230
 - No, dude; I know that girl.
          (scoffing)

25:33.232 --> 25:36.667
                    I'm serious,
            that's Kylie Atkins.
      I went to school with her.

25:36.669 --> 25:40.671
   - You know this creature?
         Not possible.

25:40.673 --> 25:43.607
Okay...

25:43.609 --> 25:46.043
  - Dude, what are you doing?

25:46.045 --> 25:48.178
- Why, are you in love with her?
          - What? No!

25:48.180 --> 25:51.715
    - Oh, my God. How long?

25:54.253 --> 25:57.655
        - Kindergarten.
      - Does she know?...
     Naw, that makes sense.

25:57.657 --> 26:00.524
          - You're a total dork,
                    and she's...

26:00.526 --> 26:04.728
            ...that.

26:09.535 --> 26:12.102
      - You are a natural!
           (laughing)

26:12.104 --> 26:15.205
 - I loved it. How did it feel?
      - You know, just me
        and my computer.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.644
      - Oh! It's Loverboy.

26:20.646 --> 26:23.581
     He's always on here.
     He's a total sweetie.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.649
       You should say hi.

26:28.387 --> 26:31.589
<i>Sorry, Loverboy, you just missed</i>
<i>me. Can you come back tomorrow?</i>

26:31.591 --> 26:34.625
    <i> We'll chat one-on-one.</i>

26:37.229 --> 26:40.631
           <i> You bet.</i>

26:42.735 --> 26:46.070
 <i> That works, I'll look for you.</i>

26:46.072 --> 26:48.072
   <i> By the way, great handle.</i>

26:48.074 --> 26:50.641
<i>Anyone with "love" in their name</i>
        <i> is okay by me.</i>

26:53.746 --> 26:56.380
      (breathing heavily)

27:01.721 --> 27:04.722
          (rewinding)

27:04.724 --> 27:08.225
<i>Anyone with "love" in their name</i>
        <i> is okay by me.</i>

27:23.876 --> 27:26.844
       (muffled moaning)

27:48.668 --> 27:51.435
     (moaning gets louder)

27:52.772 --> 27:55.673
      -<i> Aw, yeah... Oh...</i>

29:16.288 --> 29:18.355
         - (Alex): Wow.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.225
       You are really not
       taking this well.

29:21.227 --> 29:24.128
            - Yo...

29:24.130 --> 29:26.130
- Think about it this way, man.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.132
   From now on, you literally
        get to jerk off

29:28.134 --> 29:30.734
      to your dream girl.
  - She goes to Selby College,

29:30.736 --> 29:34.004
           actually.
    - Like, Selby in Milton?

29:34.006 --> 29:36.006
           - Mm-hmm.
       Dude, that's like,

29:36.008 --> 29:38.809
70 miles from here. You gotta go
  get her. I'm serious; dude,

29:38.811 --> 29:41.512
she's not only right around the
    corner, she's gettable.

29:41.514 --> 29:44.715
          "Gettable"?
 Why, 'cause she's doing porn?

29:44.717 --> 29:47.217
   - Exactly! Dude, it's got
      self-esteem issues

29:47.219 --> 29:49.787
     written all over it.
  - No, you don't understand.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.989
 There must be an explanation.
       Kylie was always

29:51.991 --> 29:53.991
  the hottest girl in Topeka,

29:53.993 --> 29:56.994
  but she was never...a slut.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.930
   - How would you know that?

29:59.932 --> 30:01.932
You said it yourself, you were
too much of a pussy to ever

30:01.934 --> 30:04.501
talk to her, so why don't you
drop some fertilizer

30:04.503 --> 30:06.603
down on those floors, and grow
your little apple seeds

30:06.605 --> 30:08.806
into Granny Smiths
and go get her!

30:08.808 --> 30:12.409
  -Mm-hmm, yes. Gonna do that.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.812
      - Fucking gorgeous.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.553
      (footsteps falling)

30:53.552 --> 30:55.719
        (gate unlocking)

31:18.510 --> 31:21.678
           (giggling)
     - Drink up, buttercup!

31:32.458 --> 31:36.860
   (electronic lock opening)

31:36.862 --> 31:38.929
 - (Heather): We need to switch
       shots for clothes.

31:38.931 --> 31:40.931
- (Devon): Strip war? Hell yeah!
         - Yeah, yeah.

31:40.933 --> 31:44.768
 - (counting cards): "Go-suck-
    cock-for-a-liv-ing..."

31:44.770 --> 31:48.972
             Fuck!
       (Heather laughing)

31:48.974 --> 31:50.974
 Lady luck over here! What, did
     you fuck a leprechaun

31:50.976 --> 31:55.712
          last night?
    - Shirt's off, sourpuss.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.454
       - Perfect... Ahh!
       (glass shattering)

32:04.456 --> 32:09.026
 You scared the crap out of me!

32:09.028 --> 32:11.028
- What are you doing here?
You know you're not supposed

32:11.030 --> 32:13.330
          to be here.
   - Gary's gonna be pissed.

32:13.332 --> 32:17.167
 - Whatever. I had nowhere else
      to go. I'm broke and
        homeless, okay?

32:18.904 --> 32:21.772
   - Anyways, I'm clean now,
      so I can come back.

32:21.774 --> 32:25.042
 - I highly doubt you're clean.
      - And Gary's already
         replaced you.

32:25.044 --> 32:28.078
      - What? You serious?

32:28.080 --> 32:31.148
         That's my bed!

32:31.150 --> 32:35.085
        - She's pretty.
        - ...And nice.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.654
 - ...And not a heroin addict.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.161
  - Gary, if you're watching,

32:44.163 --> 32:47.431
     <i> I swear I'll be good</i>
         <i> from now on.</i>

32:47.433 --> 32:51.668
   <i> Besides, you need some</i>
   <i> latin</i> panocha <i> up in here,</i>

32:51.670 --> 32:55.672
 <i> give this house some flavour.</i>

32:55.674 --> 32:59.009
    Look, I'm off the crank,
    I promise, just give me
        one more chance.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.082
       You sure you wanna
        give up on this?

33:12.057 --> 33:13.991
         (Gary typing)

33:13.993 --> 33:15.993
        (tablet pinging)

33:15.995 --> 33:20.097
    - He says you can stay
    on the couch...for now.

33:20.099 --> 33:23.000
- Thank you so much, papi, I...

33:23.002 --> 33:25.469
 I won't let you down, I swear.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.675
 (women shouting and laughing)

33:35.080 --> 33:37.047
 - (Heather): Okay, who's next?

33:37.049 --> 33:39.449
   - (Janet )I need you guys
       cheering for me!

33:39.451 --> 33:42.719
         Ready, girls?
         Pay attention!

33:42.721 --> 33:45.088
           (cheering)

33:45.090 --> 33:47.290
       Whose turn is it?
          Who's next?

33:47.292 --> 33:49.426
        - (Devon): Woo!

33:49.428 --> 33:53.130
          (chuckling)

34:27.166 --> 34:30.033
 - (Loverboy): Is that coconut?

34:34.005 --> 34:37.674
        I've missed you.

34:37.676 --> 34:40.744
    - (girl): <i> Gotcha now...</i>

34:47.453 --> 34:50.219
           (mumbling)

35:01.100 --> 35:03.834
           You got clean for me?

35:07.406 --> 35:10.073
           (sniffing)

35:11.777 --> 35:14.644
     I knew it was coconut.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.739
             - Hey.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.741
       - Linda Lovelace,

35:44.743 --> 35:47.310
         in the flesh.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.514
   Saw your show last night.
    Definitely got me hard.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.683
 The house looks nice though -
 score. When are you going to
    invite me over for tea?

35:53.685 --> 35:56.286
   - No can do. The location
        is top secret.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.288
    - Really? What about all
    the guys that come over

35:58.290 --> 36:00.857
    to pork your brains out?
     - They are blindfolded

36:00.859 --> 36:02.859
       on the drive over.
       - You're kidding.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.362
             - No.
            - Kinky.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.697
        (phone ringing)
         (hanging up)

36:07.699 --> 36:11.768
         Tell her yet?
  - I'm really not too worried

36:11.770 --> 36:15.038
     about her logging on
  and finding out, so...nope.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.359
      - Kylie... Wow! Hey.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.962
          - Uh, hi...
            - Yeah.

36:38.964 --> 36:42.332
  - Ben Stanley. What are you
doing here, do you go to Selby?

36:42.334 --> 36:45.302
- No, I don't, actually, I go to
  Old North Tech in Charlotte.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.304
But I have a chemistry lab here,

36:47.306 --> 36:50.140
         twice a week.
             - Oh.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.542
 - So, wow! It's so good to see
    you. Were you in Topeka
          this summer?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.644
           - ...Yeah.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.247
- 'Cause I... I didn't see you.
         - I didn't...

36:57.249 --> 36:59.549
        ...get out much.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.851
         My...dad died.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.788
  - Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.023
             Wow...

37:07.025 --> 37:09.392
         Well, I mean,
    I didn't know your dad,

37:09.394 --> 37:11.628
     but if he contributed
        to making you,

37:11.630 --> 37:15.765
       he must have been
        pretty awesome.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.469
     You look different...
       from high school.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.905
       Late growth spurt,
      that's what that is.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.474
    - Well, it's good to...
    - Hey, do you wanna...

37:24.476 --> 37:27.410
   Sorry, do you wanna maybe
   go for coffee some time?

37:27.412 --> 37:30.146
       Or like, a snack?
          - "Snack"?

37:30.148 --> 37:32.182
     - Yeah... I don't know
       why I said snack.

37:32.184 --> 37:34.451
 - Um... Yeah, that'd be great.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.753
    - Cool, when...should we
            do that?

37:36.755 --> 37:39.022
        - Gimme a call.
            - Okay.

37:44.196 --> 37:47.097
   - Wait, is that the time?
            - Yeah.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.099
         - I gotta go.
    - Where? I'll walk you.

37:49.101 --> 37:51.935
   - No, um... No, it's okay.
      I... Across campus.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.771
    It's far away. Call me!

38:20.766 --> 38:23.400
     (message tone binging)

38:23.402 --> 38:26.670
 Hey, Loverboy, sorry I'm late.

38:31.610 --> 38:35.245
      Aww, not this girl.
       Let's go private.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.753
             So...

38:43.755 --> 38:46.289
Do you want me to get undressed?

38:46.291 --> 38:49.693
     (message tone binging)
            - Oh...

38:49.695 --> 38:53.563
          Just talk.
          (chuckling)

38:53.565 --> 38:57.300
   Okay, sure. I can do that.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.539
 <i> What do you wanna talk about?</i>

39:02.541 --> 39:05.508
   - (girl's voice): <i> Come on,</i>
          <i> lover boy!</i>

39:08.380 --> 39:11.147
 - (Kylie): <i> Um.. The girls say</i>

39:11.149 --> 39:13.516
 <i> you're something of a regular.</i>

39:18.290 --> 39:21.691
<i>I like that. Means you're loyal.</i>

39:25.897 --> 39:29.165
   <i> What do you do for work?</i>

39:37.976 --> 39:40.677
    <i> Oh, like programming?</i>

39:43.115 --> 39:45.181
     How do you like that?

39:47.486 --> 39:51.588
       Oh, that's...nice.

39:55.293 --> 39:57.427
            <i> Aww...</i>

39:57.429 --> 40:00.130
   <i> Thanks, Loverboy. You too.</i>

40:06.605 --> 40:08.938
      <i> What do you mean?</i>

40:16.515 --> 40:20.450
      True, but sometimes
      you can just tell.

40:27.325 --> 40:31.795
       <i> Well, I'm sure</i>
    <i> you're very handsome.</i>

40:38.503 --> 40:44.007
   <i> Are you sure you don't</i>
   <i> want me to get undressed?</i>

40:44.009 --> 40:45.141
         <i> It's okay,</i>
   <i> it's what I'm here for.</i>

40:46.011 --> 40:48.178
        (phone buzzing)

40:51.016 --> 40:54.651
   <i> Sorry, Loverboy, can we</i>
   <i> pick this up another time?</i>

41:07.833 --> 41:11.568
   <i> Wait, how did you do that?</i>
   <i> Gary said this place was</i>

41:11.570 --> 41:14.604
    <i> impossible to hack...</i>

41:16.942 --> 41:19.976
      <i> - Yes, Loverboy,</i>
   <i> I think you're beautiful.</i>

41:22.347 --> 41:24.581
             <i> Bye.</i>

41:33.091 --> 41:36.559
   - It's weird, we've known
      each other since...

41:36.561 --> 41:39.195
- Since kindergarten... I think.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.197
            - Yeah.
           (laughing)

41:41.199 --> 41:44.200
And this is the first time we've
   actually really hung out.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.603
        - That is weird.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.905
       - Who else do you
 keep in touch with from home?

41:48.907 --> 41:51.708
  - Oh, just my close friends.
      You know, my homies.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.877
             Um...

41:53.879 --> 41:56.679
        What about you?

41:56.681 --> 41:58.748
       - No one, really.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.284
     It's weird, you know,
    sometimes it feels like

42:01.286 --> 42:04.354
 you have so many friends one
minute, and then you leave home

42:04.356 --> 42:06.356
and you're basically all alone.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.358
   - It's hard to picture you
        as not popular.

42:08.360 --> 42:12.395
  - I mean, I have friends...

42:12.397 --> 42:15.698
     - And now you have me.

42:15.700 --> 42:19.202
         - I do, do I?

42:19.204 --> 42:22.205
           - Mm-hmm.

42:58.610 --> 43:01.444
           (laughing)

43:01.446 --> 43:04.113
 - Uh, well, this is me, so...

43:04.115 --> 43:08.184
          - Very nice.

43:09.654 --> 43:12.755
- Hey, uh, you know there's this
      matinee on Saturday

43:12.757 --> 43:15.758
        of <i> Rear Window, </i>
      it's playing at that

43:15.760 --> 43:18.161
  old theatre by the river...

43:18.163 --> 43:20.563
 - Do you have a chemistry lab
       on Saturday, too?

43:20.565 --> 43:22.665
- Oh... Yeah, no, no, no. Um...

43:22.667 --> 43:26.235
  But Hitchcock is definitely
   worth the 70-mile drive.

43:26.237 --> 43:29.105
           (laughing)
 - Yeah, I'll see you Saturday.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.040
      - See you Saturday.

43:34.346 --> 43:37.213
- Good night.

43:37.215 --> 43:40.249
                   - Good night.

43:42.087 --> 43:44.320
           (dialling)

43:44.322 --> 43:46.990
           (ringing)
         - It's Kylie.

43:46.992 --> 43:51.260
   I need a pick-up. Thanks.

43:55.333 --> 43:58.534
      - (Alex): How's that
        exam prep going?

43:58.536 --> 44:01.304
You know, I think you might be
the only straight person I know

44:01.306 --> 44:03.740
        to turn it off
    when the nudity starts.

44:03.742 --> 44:05.742
         Which does beg
  the interesting question of,

44:05.744 --> 44:07.744
       you are straight,

44:07.746 --> 44:11.481
          aren't you?
           - Dude...

44:11.483 --> 44:13.983
      I'm gonna tell her.

44:13.985 --> 44:17.920
        ...That I know.
       - About <i> Girlhouse?</i>

44:17.922 --> 44:21.424
        Bad idea, dude.
       - Okay, um... Why?

44:21.426 --> 44:23.926
  - If she knows, then she'll
think that you think she's easy.

44:23.928 --> 44:26.896
  Any girl on a site like this
        must be a whore.

44:26.898 --> 44:28.898
   - But I don't think that.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.067
 - It's not gonna matter, dude.

44:31.069 --> 44:34.704
You wanna keep this thing going,
then trust me: do not tell her.

44:38.309 --> 44:40.677
        (phones ringing)

45:22.353 --> 45:24.420
                    - Excuse me.

45:31.496 --> 45:34.464
                             Hi.

45:40.905 --> 45:45.007
         Wow, looks intimidating
                       in there.

45:45.009 --> 45:47.610
        You must be pretty smart
         if you know how to work

45:47.612 --> 45:50.079
    all those wires and buttons.

45:51.883 --> 45:54.350
      I've always been attracted
                   to smart men.

45:54.352 --> 45:56.619
                Men with brains.

45:56.621 --> 46:00.690
           But do you wanna know
               what's not smart?

46:00.692 --> 46:04.293
                What's not smart
         is coming to a job site

46:04.295 --> 46:06.963
     and then sexually harassing
           one of the employees.

46:06.965 --> 46:09.832
      I saw what you were doing.

46:09.834 --> 46:12.001
             Tongue hanging out,

46:12.003 --> 46:14.237
          like some thirsty dog.

46:14.239 --> 46:16.973
           Get a good peek? Hmm?

46:16.975 --> 46:20.543
          One word to your boss,

46:20.545 --> 46:22.545
          I could have you fired
                      like this.

46:22.547 --> 46:25.915
   Next time, think twice before
      preying on innocent women.

46:25.917 --> 46:28.518
                         Got it?

46:28.520 --> 46:30.553
                         I said,

46:30.555 --> 46:33.990
      you got it, you sick perv?

46:39.764 --> 46:41.931
          (screaming)

46:48.139 --> 46:50.139
           OH MY GOD!

46:50.141 --> 46:53.776
  Hmm. Not so smart after all.

47:03.121 --> 47:06.122
 - (Kylie): Poor Jimmy Stewart,
  with those two broken legs!

47:06.124 --> 47:08.691
  - But he got the girl, so...

47:08.693 --> 47:10.693
          - It is a pretty steep
                 price for love.

47:10.695 --> 47:14.330
  - (in Jimmy Stewart voice):
     No price is too steep
       for love, Kylie.

47:14.332 --> 47:17.466
     That was good, right,
         a good Jimmy?

47:17.468 --> 47:19.702
  - (Kylie): What are the odds

47:19.704 --> 47:22.572
  that we bump into each other
    like that the other day?

47:22.574 --> 47:25.074
                     It's crazy!

47:25.076 --> 47:28.244
- Well, maybe
it wasn't so random.

47:28.246 --> 47:30.746
             - What do you mean?

47:30.748 --> 47:33.950
- I um... I know.

47:33.952 --> 47:38.387
...About <i> Girlhouse.</i>

47:41.526 --> 47:44.994
                    - Oh, I see.
     You saw something you liked

47:44.996 --> 47:47.196
        and you wanted to sample
                the merchandise.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.866
- No, it's not like that at all.
I don't understand...

47:49.868 --> 47:52.468
    - You don't understand.
        - Then help me.

47:52.470 --> 47:55.438
       - I'm going to go.
           - Kylie...

47:55.440 --> 47:58.708
I only brought it up 'cause I
don't want it to be an issue

47:58.710 --> 48:01.644
moving forward.

48:01.646 --> 48:04.247
           - Porn is not what it
               used to be, okay?

48:04.249 --> 48:07.283
     It's totally different now.
   It's mainstream and accepted.

48:07.285 --> 48:10.119
  I mean, think about Sasha Grey
               or Jenna Jameson.

48:10.121 --> 48:13.522
There's no stigma. Nobody cares.
         - Yeah, but...

48:13.524 --> 48:18.094
       ...shouldn't they?
        - I don't know.

48:18.096 --> 48:20.897
- What about these other guys

48:20.899 --> 48:23.933
that are coming to the house?

48:23.935 --> 48:26.702
      - Fair. It's not required.

48:26.704 --> 48:29.105
- Okay, but I assume

48:29.107 --> 48:31.741
it's a big part of the job
sooner or later.

48:31.743 --> 48:35.177
 - Not necessarily.<i> Girlhouse</i> is
  different. It's not like that.

48:35.179 --> 48:37.380
           The guys that log in,

48:37.382 --> 48:39.482
         it's not just for that.

48:39.484 --> 48:41.484
                  They feel like
     they're getting to know us.

48:41.486 --> 48:43.486
          They develop feelings,
        they fall in love, even.

48:43.488 --> 48:46.956
- Come on, Kylie. They just
want to fuck you. That's all.

48:46.958 --> 48:49.492
                - Well, I am not
              that type of girl.

48:49.494 --> 48:51.494
- Yeah, that's what
I keep telling myself.

48:51.496 --> 48:53.496
                - You know what,
               you have no right

48:53.498 --> 48:56.265
              to judge me, okay?

48:56.267 --> 48:59.001
           You have no idea what
    I'm going through right now.

48:59.003 --> 49:01.971
                  I'm doing this
 so I don't have to quit school.

49:01.973 --> 49:05.441
  My dad's gone and my mom needs
       all the help she can get.

49:05.443 --> 49:08.311
    And you know what, the guys?

49:08.313 --> 49:10.479
        That's the toughest part
                     about this.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.848
 Okay? I'm hoping I can just get
    in there, make as much money

49:12.850 --> 49:16.619
      as I can, and then get out
   before that becomes an issue.

49:21.726 --> 49:24.994
       I've thought this through
                     completely.

49:24.996 --> 49:29.565
              I really don't see
  how anything bad could happen.

49:29.567 --> 49:33.402
          - I'm sorry.

49:35.406 --> 49:40.176
        So... Is this, you know,
           going to be a problem

49:40.178 --> 49:43.079
                 moving forward?

49:43.081 --> 49:45.982
     - Not until you ask me
       to stay the night.

49:45.984 --> 49:50.386
   I am extremely camera-shy.

50:45.109 --> 50:49.545
      -<i> No idea, Loverboy. </i>

50:49.547 --> 50:52.648
     <i> I'm kinda busy here.</i>

50:56.754 --> 51:00.990
     <i> Loverboy, I'm trying</i>
        <i> to do a show.</i>

51:07.031 --> 51:10.099
   <i> Jesus! I said I don't know</i>
        <i> where she is.</i>

51:10.101 --> 51:12.668
<i>You really are a pathetic freak.</i>

51:24.649 --> 51:27.149
-<i> You were with him last night? </i>
  -<i> Yeah, I had sex with him </i>

51:27.151 --> 51:30.119
<i>the other night and then I told</i>
   <i> you that he was small.</i>

51:30.121 --> 51:33.956
  - Well, I mean, he's okay...

51:33.958 --> 51:36.525
    - Well, you told me that
        he was small...

51:36.527 --> 51:39.261
        - Who is that?
 - Oh, my God, look who it is!

51:39.263 --> 51:43.032
     It's Loverboy... Yeah.
        - Oh, Loverboy!

51:43.034 --> 51:45.401
Hey, Loverboy, I'm just curious.

51:45.403 --> 51:48.537
    How did you come up with
    that handle, "Loverboy"?

51:48.539 --> 51:52.441
       You must be quite
       the ladies' man.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.543
Could have gone with "Loserboy".

51:56.681 --> 52:00.516
   (girl's laughter echoing)

52:00.518 --> 52:02.518
          (laughing)
         - Definitely.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.653
  - Janet! Janet! Come say hi
         to Loverboy.

52:04.655 --> 52:07.490
     - Aww, poor Loverboy!

52:07.492 --> 52:11.060
         Don't be mean.

52:11.062 --> 52:16.098
    - (Anna): Enough of him.
        I mean, anyways.

52:46.364 --> 52:51.000
          (screaming)

53:52.263 --> 53:55.364
           - What...

54:08.746 --> 54:11.347
      (car radio playing)

54:19.857 --> 54:21.957
         (lock beeping)

54:28.599 --> 54:31.467
      (muffled electronic
        music playing)

54:59.297 --> 55:01.363
             (thud)

55:11.042 --> 55:13.342
           (grunting)

55:13.344 --> 55:17.012
     (banging door on head)
          (screaming)

55:39.303 --> 55:42.104
       (muffled shouting)

55:44.942 --> 55:47.009
      (muffled screaming)

55:50.414 --> 55:52.481
       (inhaling deeply)

56:04.061 --> 56:06.128
 - (Loverboy): Enjoy the show.

56:10.768 --> 56:13.936
     - Come on, have dinner
        with me tonight.

56:13.938 --> 56:15.938
We can drive back to Charlotte.

56:15.940 --> 56:20.476
   We can go to this awesome
    barbeque place, you can
     meet my roommates...

56:20.478 --> 56:23.312
    - How would I get back?

56:23.314 --> 56:25.481
  - You could spend the night.

56:25.483 --> 56:28.484
- I told you I have study group.

56:28.486 --> 56:31.487
  But I'll take a rain check.

56:31.489 --> 56:34.990
Because meeting your roommate is
totally worth the 70-mile drive.

56:34.992 --> 56:39.061
        (both laughing)
           - Funny.

56:59.517 --> 57:02.518
  - Is this some kind of joke?

57:08.859 --> 57:10.859
          Hey, buddy!

57:10.861 --> 57:13.562
       Private property,
       you can't be here.

57:21.071 --> 57:25.174
        Turn around now,
       before I make you.

57:25.176 --> 57:27.976
       All right, well,
       you asked for it.

57:27.978 --> 57:30.612
    Ahh! Fuck, that... Oof!

57:40.458 --> 57:43.125
        (neck breaking)

58:00.044 --> 58:02.010
           (beeping)

58:02.012 --> 58:04.079
        (door unlocking)

58:09.019 --> 58:11.553
    (muffled music playing)

58:11.555 --> 58:13.622
       (muffled moaning)

58:16.260 --> 58:19.394
  - (Anna): Ooh, baby... Mm...

58:22.433 --> 58:26.935
              ¶¶¶

58:33.143 --> 58:37.145
          Oh, baby...

58:41.252 --> 58:44.686
           (moaning)

58:44.688 --> 58:46.755
         (door opening)

58:54.098 --> 58:56.098
        Can I help you?

58:56.100 --> 58:58.467
     (breathing ominously)

59:05.809 --> 59:09.211
         Let me guess.
     You're here for Devon?

59:13.117 --> 59:17.319
      No, wait... Heather.

59:17.321 --> 59:20.989
   She likes that kinky shit.

59:24.695 --> 59:28.163
        Well, run along.
      Her room's upstairs.

59:32.770 --> 59:34.736
- Homie, you're really starting
     to piss me off, man.

59:34.738 --> 59:37.806
      (frantic breathing)

59:39.243 --> 59:42.277
        (weakly moaning)

59:45.215 --> 59:47.783
           (choking)

59:55.426 --> 59:58.260
        (choking stops)

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:20.248
 (inhaling and exhaling deeply)

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:25.954
             - Hi.
             - Hey.

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:39.067
      (rap music playing)

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:46.208
      -<i> All right, boys,</i>
<i>ready to have your minds blown?</i>

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:49.511
           (beeping)

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.518
        <i> Only 3 of you?</i>

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.988
 <i> ...Or only 3 of you with your</i>
     <i> hands free to type?</i>

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:17.406
      - Yeah, screw this.
     I'm going one-on-one.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:24.346
 - Sorry, fellas. Tugboat and I
       are going private.

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:29.885
      (soft music playing)

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.690
       - I'm going to go.
    Got a lot to do tonight.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:38.493
   - Reading <i> War and Peace</i> or
    showing your lady parts
      to all of humanity?

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:42.230
          - Real cute.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:03.919
         - What the...

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.927
             Okay.

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.505
         What the fuck?

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.193
 -<i> What are you talking about? </i>

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:52.467
- Maybe jerking off really does
       ruin your vision.

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:21.696
           Aw, shit!

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.376
 <i> What's your problem, Tugboat?</i>

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:42.484
 <i> Okay, is this a prank? Are you</i>
   <i> trying to freak me out?</i>

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:44.553
          <i> Not cool.</i>

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:58.366
     <i> Okay, you know what?</i>

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:00.368
     <i> If that's how you're</i>
         <i> going to be,</i>

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:03.772
<i>this session is over. Fuck you.</i>

01:04:03.774 --> 01:04:07.275
          (screaming)

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:11.213
      -<i> HELP ME! NO! AHH!</i>
          -<i> Shut up!</i>

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:14.049
            - Jesus!

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.588
 Dude, I need you to come here,
           right now.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.559
       (Devon screaming)

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:29.397
       - Somebody help...
           (choking)

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:39.174
         - What is this, a joke?

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:45.380
               - Ahh, my face...

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.449
- What's that they say
about beauty?

01:04:47.451 --> 01:04:51.086
   Something about skin deep?
          (screaming)

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:53.922
 - Is this real? Is this really
      happening right now,

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:55.924
    or is it, like, some gimmick
            to drive up traffic?

01:04:55.926 --> 01:04:59.594
 - I don't know! They did some
    weird shit before, but
      nothing like this!

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.271
                   Nobody knows.

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:12.340
Call 911, now, right now! Do it!
             I gotta warn Kylie.

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:30.959
           (dialling)

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:37.966
        (phone buzzing)

01:05:47.678 --> 01:05:50.612
             Shit!

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.055
        - What the fuck?
      - (dispatcher): <i> 911,</i>
    <i> what's your emergency?</i>

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:02.057
 - Hi, um, I don't really know
       how to explain...

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:04.059
     So I'm on this website
       called <i> Girlhouse.</i>

01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:06.127
         - "Girlhouse"?
 - It's a pornographic website.

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.129
 -<i> Sir, I'm not following, this</i>
 <i> line is for emergencies only. </i>

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:10.131
- Look, I realize that, but I'm
   pretty sure I'm watching

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.000
 a girl being murdered online.

01:06:12.002 --> 01:06:15.036
        -<i> Where is she? </i>
     - I don't know! Um...

01:06:15.038 --> 01:06:16.972
    -<i> Is she in Charlotte? </i>
   - I have no fucking clue!

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:19.040
     I'm pretty sure she's
    somewhere in the state.

01:06:19.042 --> 01:06:22.010
-<i> Well, if you don't know where</i>
   <i> she is, how am I supposed</i>
        <i> to help her? </i>

01:06:22.012 --> 01:06:24.946
          <i> Sir? Sir?</i>

01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:28.616
    - That's it. That's it.
           (sobbing)

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.190
        - (Devon): Why?

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:39.728
   - He's putting on a show.
 - I can't get a hold of Kylie.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:43.665
    Did you call the cops?
   - They can't do anything.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.667
     - What do you mean--
     - We don't know where

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:49.671
     the house is. It could
   be fucking anywhere, man.
Did Kylie ever tell you? Dude...

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:57.812
         - No, no, NO!
      DON'T, DON'T, DON'T!

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:00.949
       (screaming loudly)

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:11.426
            - Ugh...

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:13.595
       - This is insane.
     Dude, there has to be

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:15.797
     some way to find them.
 - From a live video broadcast?

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:18.333
- What about the website, okay?
It has to be registered, or...

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:20.735
-<i> Girlhouse</i> prides itself on its
impenetrability, man. Trust me.

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:22.904
      I've snooped around.
           - Well...

01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:26.074
         Okay, we know
  they're in Carolina, right?
 Kylie goes to Selby in Milton,

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.710
 so it can't be far from there.
 - That really narrows it down.

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:41.790
  - Fucking call the cops again,
     man! Do something! See what

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.825
   they have on the website, all
        right? Business records,

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:47.162
licences, tax receipts,
anything. And then I need
you to hop onto that computer

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:49.831
   and work your magic. You're a
friggin' CompSci major, dig into

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:51.900
   your bag of wizardry and then
   hack the fuck into that site.

01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:54.335
- Well what are you going to do?
  - I'm gonna drive to Milton.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:57.238
Hopefully you'll have an address
for me by the time I get there.
         - That'll take

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.240
      an hour and a half!
 - I'll be there in 45 minutes.

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.810
Don't let me down, okay?
Kylie's life may depend on this.

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:05.280
     - No pressure, right?

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:10.919
         (whimpering)
     - I'm so... Please...

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:19.194
            - MOM...

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:23.698
           (sobbing)

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:29.770
            - Oof..

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:37.212
 (inhaling and exhaling deeply)

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.751
            - Damn!
          - Close one.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:02.136
- (man on TV): <i> Are you married?</i>

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.816
    - It's called love, dumbass.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:18.653
  Believe it or not, some people
                still want that.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:21.589
- Please, there are far too many
     distractions nowadays.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:26.060
 Porn sites, the dating sites,

01:09:26.062 --> 01:09:28.830
       cheating sites...

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:31.232
  You really think if this guy
         had <i> Girlhouse </i>

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:34.569
   he'd have acted this way?

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:37.872
 He'd be too busy watching you.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:47.814

               then we can fuck.

for me. I'm gonna rinse off

01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:26.234
and head upstairs before I pass
     out. You wanna come?
