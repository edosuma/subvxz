WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.900
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

00:02.000 --> 00:05.100
Where did you even get this?
It was e-mailed to me this morning.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.800
Julian, we're being blackmailed.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.800
You filmed us having sex?
You found my computer?

00:09.900 --> 00:10.800
No. But someone did.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.900
And now Julian and his
father are being blackmailed

00:13.000 --> 00:14.400
for 1 million dollars thanks to you!

00:14.500 --> 00:16.200
We just said we were
getting the tape out there.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.500
The plan was never to blackmail
these people for money.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.900
Look, we got to tell Brooke, all right?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
She's got no idea...

00:21.100 --> 00:23.100
Look, I told Brooke I was taking a lover.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.700
You just need to relax.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.700
I came home for you because I love you.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.600
It's just, things are different.
Is there someone else?

00:29.734 --> 00:30.734
Maybe.

00:30.802 --> 00:32.403
- Is you, isn't it?
- Yes, but...

00:35.006 --> 00:37.841
Thanks for sleeping with
my girlfriend, buddy.

00:37.908 --> 00:40.719
I'm being deported.
Marry me.

00:40.753 --> 00:44.126
What did you just say?
Marrying me fixes everything.

00:44.161 --> 00:47.567
Somebody bought your portrait.
She's right there.

00:47.601 --> 00:50.683
Remember the tennis player that
wouldn't take no for an answer?

00:50.717 --> 00:53.387
She is the girl who bought
my portrait tonight.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.558
That Katie girl?

00:54.592 --> 00:57.336
Why do you have a photo with her?
Because it's not her.

00:57.404 --> 00:59.470
It's Sara.

00:59.505 --> 01:01.843
Even though she doesn't
show it all the time,

01:01.911 --> 01:05.646
deep down inside, your mom is still
very sad that your grandma died.

01:05.713 --> 01:08.714
Mom's gonna be okay, right?
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.994 --> 02:32.997
Welcome to Brooke's spa.
We hope you enjoy your stay.

02:37.436 --> 02:40.139
Trust m, it's great for the skin.
In that case...

02:44.511 --> 02:47.279
Seriously?

02:47.314 --> 02:51.183
That thing has been ringing nonstop.
Didn't the shoot just end?

02:51.218 --> 02:55.121
Yeah, but editing just started.
You just did the thing.

02:55.155 --> 02:57.156
What thing?

02:57.224 --> 03:00.159
Whenever you're passionate about
something, your eyebrows tighten up

03:00.227 --> 03:02.895
I saw it a lot on set.

03:02.930 --> 03:05.965
And even though I think it's kind of sexy,
m worried about you.

03:06.032 --> 03:08.501
Why? Because I'll never win
the world poker championship?

03:08.535 --> 03:11.003
No. Because when you're
passionate about something,

03:11.037 --> 03:12.939
you put everything you have into it.

03:12.973 --> 03:16.409
Have you stopped for one second to relax?

03:16.443 --> 03:19.045
Yes. For about five hours every night.

03:19.079 --> 03:22.181
Sleeping doesn't count.
I'm serious, Julian.

03:22.249 --> 03:24.783
I need you to take
 care of yourself

03:24.851 --> 03:28.053
because I want you to live
for a long, long time.

03:28.088 --> 03:31.390
Well, I will as long as I have you.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.393
Brooke's spa will always be
here to help you recuperate.

03:53.113 --> 03:56.049
Alexander did what to Victoria?

03:56.083 --> 03:59.353
Actually, it was Victoria
doing things to Alexander.

04:00.923 --> 04:07.062
Totally ew but totally awesome.
And you and Josh made a sex tape.

04:07.096 --> 04:08.764
I don't know which is worse.

04:08.798 --> 04:11.400
I do. But just for the record,
Josh made the tape.

04:11.435 --> 04:12.869
I just suffered through it.

04:12.903 --> 04:14.938
No way.
Yes way.

04:16.808 --> 04:21.712
Oh, I almost forgot.
Skills punched out Melvin.

04:28.553 --> 04:30.454
- It's illegal.
- It's not.

04:30.522 --> 04:34.091
It's absolutely illegal for me to marry
someone just to stay in the country.

04:34.126 --> 04:37.229
Not if there are real feelings involved.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.967
Look, it's late.

04:43.035 --> 04:48.539
Take the night to think about it.
You can say "I do" in the morning.

05:27.322 --> 05:29.891
Someone's up early this morning.

05:29.925 --> 05:32.527
Nervous for your music-video shoot?

05:34.897 --> 05:38.833
You'll do great, Hales. You always do.

05:41.437 --> 05:45.139
Have a good run, dad.
Thanks, buddy.

05:45.207 --> 05:46.607
So, mom, what's for breakfast?

06:06.929 --> 06:09.864
What do you think? It's our new campaign.

06:09.932 --> 06:12.367
I'm calling it "The blunder down under."

06:12.435 --> 06:16.938
I think my hair looks amazing,
but that flag needs to be much bigger.

06:16.973 --> 06:19.274
Mother!
Brooke.

06:19.275 --> 06:21.944
He's half your age.
Lucky me.

06:21.978 --> 06:24.213
I'm serious. What are you thinking?

06:24.247 --> 06:27.416
I'm sorry you're offended that
Alexander and I are lovers now.

06:27.451 --> 06:30.486
No, I'm just offended that you
decided to display that love

06:30.554 --> 06:35.993
in front of all my friends.
Oh, please. Cougars are in now.

06:36.061 --> 06:40.265
Morning, Brooke.
Doughnut?

06:42.168 --> 06:43.969
Have fun with your "cub."

06:55.582 --> 06:58.083
Please.
You've got 30 seconds.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.751
You're used to working
in that timeframe, right?

07:01.720 --> 07:05.456
Last night isn't what you think.
What I think is you're a jerk.

07:05.490 --> 07:08.192
What I saw was you making
out with another guy.

07:08.226 --> 07:10.694
Haven't you ever done something
that you didn't mean to do?

07:10.728 --> 07:12.829
Yes. I had sex with you.

07:12.897 --> 07:16.699
I would appreciate it if you
didn't tell anyone what you saw.

07:16.734 --> 07:18.501
Yeah? Well, I'd appreciate it

07:18.535 --> 07:20.736
if you didn't tape me having sex with you.

07:20.804 --> 07:24.406
Oh, wait. You already did.
I shouldn't have done that.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.807
And I'm sorry.

07:25.842 --> 07:31.079
But I'm asking you,
please... don't tell anyone.

07:31.114 --> 07:34.817
Josh is gay.
Alex, I understand you're upset.

07:34.851 --> 07:36.785
True, but I also caught
him sticking his tongue

07:38.021 --> 07:41.357
are you sure it wasn't
a boyish-looking girl?

07:41.425 --> 07:43.926
It was a guy. Maybe you'll
meet him at the wrap party.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.329
There's not gonna be a wrap party.

07:46.363 --> 07:49.299
No wrap party? Kind of cheap, isn't it?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.800
Not really. Considering
there are two leads

07:51.836 --> 07:55.973
decided to cost the film an extra
million dollars with their sex tape.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.242
Josh made the tape.
I just suffered through it.

07:58.277 --> 08:00.044
You can also suffer through no wrap party.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.588
It's kind of creepy, right?

08:09.655 --> 08:12.290
That this Katie girl looks just like Sara

08:12.358 --> 08:14.493
and she bought the picture of you.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.329
Yeah, it's weird.

08:17.363 --> 08:21.065
But maybe it's just that...
weird but harmless.

08:22.868 --> 08:25.670
How come you never told me about
her whenever you first met her?

08:27.572 --> 08:29.640
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

08:29.674 --> 08:31.875
You know, but with your mom being sick,

08:31.909 --> 08:33.376
it just didn't seem important.

08:34.878 --> 08:39.381
As important.
It's okay.

08:39.416 --> 08:43.451
Mean, like you said,
hopefully she's just harmless, right?

08:43.486 --> 08:45.620
Either that or completely psychotic.

08:47.723 --> 08:50.391
Listen, I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

08:50.426 --> 08:52.227
But just in case, I'll make some calls

08:52.295 --> 08:54.896
and see if I can find out more about her.

08:54.931 --> 08:57.299
And, babe, I am sorry for not telling you.

09:00.003 --> 09:01.937
It's okay.

09:10.547 --> 09:15.284
I heard you had a rough night.
Yeah.

09:15.319 --> 09:18.888
You guys look so young.

09:18.923 --> 09:22.025
I wish I would have known
you in high school.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.096
Do you want to talk about it?

09:27.131 --> 09:30.067
It's not like Lauren and I
planned any of this, you know?

09:30.134 --> 09:32.802
It just sort of happened.

09:32.837 --> 09:36.740
But you like her?
I do.

09:36.774 --> 09:40.910
Then you should talk to Skills.
Tell him that.

09:40.945 --> 09:43.881
You guys have been friends a long time.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.685
I should probably be getting to work.

09:48.753 --> 09:51.221
Thanks for stopping by, Millie.
It means a lot.

09:51.256 --> 09:54.658
After all you've done for me,
it's the least I could do.

09:58.364 --> 10:02.033
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

10:02.068 --> 10:06.539
Do you ever miss me?
Of course.

10:06.573 --> 10:11.210
Thanks.
That means a lot, too.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.554
Look like you didn't
sleep much last night.

10:22.588 --> 10:25.223
That's because I didn't.

10:25.290 --> 10:30.494
Sounds good.
Dance with me.

10:30.529 --> 10:36.132
Grubbs...
Just dance with me.

10:37.835 --> 10:39.869
Practice for the wedding.

10:41.705 --> 10:46.041
I can't marry you.
Why not?

10:46.109 --> 10:50.646
We dance good together.
That's not a reason to get married.

10:50.713 --> 10:55.683
It's a start.
Listen to me.

10:55.718 --> 10:58.186
We need to focus on the
album... your album.

10:58.221 --> 11:00.121
And... and we don't have much time.

11:00.156 --> 11:03.859
The music's good, Michael.

11:03.927 --> 11:06.228
Now you just have to find the words.

11:14.471 --> 11:16.638
Hey, Skills. Can I talk to you?

11:18.775 --> 11:20.209
Where y'all going?

11:20.243 --> 11:23.746
Laundry.
Cooking class?

11:33.656 --> 11:36.658
You're my best friend, Skills.
And I just...

11:38.661 --> 11:41.396
Lauren and I were just
hanging out, you know?

11:41.464 --> 11:43.965
It's not like we planned this.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.164
There's my guy!

12:16.199 --> 12:18.934
- I wanted to check on you. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

12:19.002 --> 12:21.003
I'm glad you did, though.
I need to ask you a question.

12:21.038 --> 12:22.472
Shoot.

12:22.506 --> 12:25.742
Right after Skills punched me,
were your mom and Alexander...

12:25.810 --> 12:30.847
Yes. Don't remind me. Thanks.
I left the store to avoid them.

12:30.915 --> 12:32.449
Scandalous.

12:32.516 --> 12:34.517
Not as scandalous as two
best friends fighting.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.754
- What?
- Well, it's just funny, hearing that from the girl

12:38.822 --> 12:41.924
who wore a black eye to prom,
courtesy of her bff.

12:41.958 --> 12:44.426
Okay. Well, I remember a certain someone

12:44.460 --> 12:46.962
encouraging me to make up with Peyton...

12:47.029 --> 12:50.532
Something about too much
history to just walk away.

12:50.566 --> 12:52.334
Thank you for that, by the way.

12:52.369 --> 12:55.004
If it weren't for P. Sawyer,
I would have never met Julian.

12:55.039 --> 12:58.541
You're welcome.
So, what now?

12:58.576 --> 13:00.310
I'm very well versed in girl code,

13:00.344 --> 13:02.646
but I thought guy code didn't
extend past a high five.

13:02.681 --> 13:03.848
Usually.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.452
But when a guy really cares about a girl,
guy code is pretty much the same.

13:08.487 --> 13:09.987
I feel horrible.

13:10.055 --> 13:15.027
Well, have you guys talked about it?
I tried. He walked away.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.496
I'm sorry, buddy. That sucks.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.598
Yeah.

13:25.773 --> 13:29.875
"Brooke Davis caught in
sex act with boy toy"?!

13:29.910 --> 13:43.989
That sucks worse.
Skills... round two.

13:58.306 --> 14:01.975
How can you do this to me?
We broke up, Antwon.

14:02.010 --> 14:06.447
Yeah, but only because of geography.
You really think that's all it was?

14:06.515 --> 14:08.482
You left. We barely talked.

14:08.517 --> 14:12.052
And... and that's okay,
but don't put this all on me.

14:14.622 --> 14:16.222
But you stopped calling.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.625
I didn't even know you were coming home

14:20.627 --> 14:22.895
yeah, but with my best friend?

14:24.931 --> 14:28.433
You must feel guilty.
That's why you came over here, right?

14:28.468 --> 14:31.804
I came over here to tell you to
stop being a jerk to your friend.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.673
So, that's it?
You're choosing Mouth over me?

14:34.741 --> 14:39.178
I didn't choose anyone,
but this version of you isn't helping.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.556
You're not helping.
You're not even listening.

14:49.590 --> 14:51.324
Haley!

14:51.358 --> 14:53.660
Grubbs proposed to me.
Do you believe that?

14:53.694 --> 14:55.661
I... I mean, maybe I do like him.

14:55.696 --> 14:58.264
But like isn't love.
And... and like isn't marriage.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.166
Anyway, enough about me.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.800
We should be focusing on your music video.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.102
They're expecting you in wardrobe.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.505
After that, hair and makeup.
The live portion will be at Tric...

15:18.520 --> 15:20.588
"Oh, thanks, Miranda."

15:26.896 --> 15:28.897
Five minutes, Haley.

15:56.127 --> 15:57.728
Alex.

15:57.762 --> 15:59.964
I just want to apologize
about the sex tape.

16:00.031 --> 16:02.367
I know you and Julia put
a lot into this film.

16:02.435 --> 16:05.704
The sex tape was yesterday's problem.

16:05.739 --> 16:08.040
You put a lot into this film, too.

16:08.074 --> 16:10.776
You did great work. Maybe your best work.

16:10.844 --> 16:14.913
But that won't matter if
nobody shows up to see it.

16:14.947 --> 16:20.452
You need to keep Josh's...
personal life under wraps.

16:20.487 --> 16:22.788
Our film is a love story
between a guy and a girl,

16:22.856 --> 16:24.156
not a guy and a guy.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.092
I think that's why they call it acting.

16:27.160 --> 16:31.730
How many openly gay
leading men can you name?

16:31.765 --> 16:34.667
Doesn't make it right.

16:34.701 --> 16:37.703
Doesn't make it okay.
It's just the way it is.

16:37.771 --> 16:41.040
I just don't think it matters.
I hope it doesn't.

16:41.074 --> 16:42.942
But we can't afford to take that risk.

16:42.976 --> 16:45.077
Julian can't afford it.

16:52.987 --> 16:55.589
You have until tonight to
give Paul his money back.

16:55.623 --> 16:59.893
What's that supposed to mean?
How could you do this to us?

16:59.927 --> 17:02.028
And to the movie? And to Alex,
for that matter?

17:02.096 --> 17:03.463
Hey, I'm an actor, okay?

17:03.497 --> 17:05.498
I travel a lot. The road gets lonely.

17:05.531 --> 17:08.134
You know what? Save it. Alex told me.

17:08.202 --> 17:10.136
You didn't think we would
put two and two together

17:10.204 --> 17:11.404
with the extortion?

17:11.438 --> 17:14.573
I'd have you arrested,
if it wasn't for the film.

17:14.608 --> 17:17.910
I wasn't behind the extortion.
I wanted the tape to get out.

17:22.615 --> 17:25.483
My ex-boyfriend is threatening to out me.

17:25.518 --> 17:27.553
That's not my problem.

17:27.619 --> 17:30.255
One bad Indie film isn't
gonna kill my career,

17:30.323 --> 17:31.923
but a scandal like this could.

17:34.327 --> 17:36.461
A scandal like this
could kill us right now.

17:36.529 --> 17:38.864
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
U think that's dramatic?

17:38.932 --> 17:40.433
Wait till I have you fire Alexander.

17:40.467 --> 17:42.601
You wouldn't. I might.

17:42.636 --> 17:44.871
How could you do something
like that in public?!

17:44.939 --> 17:46.306
And better question...

17:46.340 --> 17:48.208
What imbecile would mistake
me for my mother?!

17:48.243 --> 17:52.646
Maybe it's not that bad.
"Clothes over blows"?!

17:52.681 --> 17:54.615
It's the second biggest
scandal of the week!

17:54.649 --> 17:56.050
Well, what's the first?

17:56.084 --> 17:58.152
Oh, God.

18:05.460 --> 18:09.763
Grubbs, you seen Haley?
Uh, I think she's with Miranda.

18:09.798 --> 18:12.200
Can I get you something
to drink while you wait?

18:12.267 --> 18:16.405
Yeah, sure.
What'll it be?

18:16.473 --> 18:18.842
You've never asked me that before.

18:18.876 --> 18:21.578
I'm a little off my game today.

18:21.612 --> 18:23.614
Just Miranda.

18:23.681 --> 18:26.617
Ah. That sounds like
when I first met Haley.

18:28.186 --> 18:29.320
I'll have a whiskey and water.

18:32.090 --> 18:34.725
Actually, you know what?
It's still daylight outside.

18:34.793 --> 18:36.293
Hold the whiskey.

18:39.297 --> 18:43.300
I mean, at least Haley liked you.
Miranda just keeps shooting me down.

18:43.334 --> 18:45.102
Haley hated me in the beginning.

18:45.137 --> 18:47.305
How did you change things?
What did you do?

18:47.339 --> 18:50.675
Nothing. There was nothing I could do.

18:50.710 --> 18:54.013
One day, she just decided let me in.

18:55.515 --> 18:56.916
You can only do what you do, man.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.055
Nathan, have you seen Haley?

19:02.123 --> 19:04.658
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

19:07.763 --> 19:11.329
No, I didn't know that.
Can you tell me why Katie was...

19:13.234 --> 19:16.069
Yeah, any information would be helpful.

19:16.137 --> 19:19.405
And could you have Tanesha give me a call?

19:19.439 --> 19:21.740
Great. Thank you.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.600
what can I get you boys?

19:57.356 --> 20:00.225
Can I get a grilled cheese
with chicken fingers,

20:00.259 --> 20:02.561
extra fries, and a chocolate milkshake?

20:05.064 --> 20:08.733
What? I had leftover Chinese
for breakfast. I'm starving.

20:08.768 --> 20:10.101
Okay.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.903
And a vanilla shake for me.

20:14.173 --> 20:17.909
So... how much did you miss your Uncle Skills?

20:20.212 --> 20:23.615
Oh, come on, man.
It better be more than that.

20:23.683 --> 20:26.718
That's what I'm talking about.

20:26.786 --> 20:29.788
Can I tell you a secret?
Let's hear it.

20:29.789 --> 20:32.924
I know someone who missed
you even more miss Lauren.

20:32.992 --> 20:35.860
She was pretty sad that you left.

20:35.895 --> 20:38.129
I bet she's happy now that you're back.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.432
I don't know, Dawg.

20:40.499 --> 20:43.868
Things are different now. She moved on.

20:43.903 --> 20:49.107
What's moved on?
Mouth stole her from me.

20:49.141 --> 20:54.613
You believe that? My friend.
Or at least my ex-friend.

20:54.647 --> 20:57.415
So you're not gonna be
friends wit Mouth anymore

20:57.450 --> 20:59.117
because he stole miss Lauren from you?

20:59.151 --> 21:02.187
Yeah, well, friends just
don't do that, Jamie.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.322
Well, you stole miss
Lauren away from me first,

21:04.357 --> 21:06.324
and we're still friends.

21:10.900 --> 21:13.500
you want the bad news
or the really bad news?

21:14.100 --> 21:16.925
How about the bad news?
Well, your girlfriend

21:16.959 --> 21:18.827
is the second biggest
Internet scandal of the day.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.830
"Brooke Davis caught in
sex act with boy toy!"

21:23.666 --> 21:26.868
I cannot believe they
confused me with my mother!

21:26.935 --> 21:28.136
Well, in their defense,

21:28.170 --> 21:30.171
she was being blocked by
Alexander's naked body.

21:32.641 --> 21:34.976
Which brings me to the really bad news.

21:35.044 --> 21:39.247
"Alex Dupre and Josh
Avery in steamy sex tape.

21:39.281 --> 21:41.349
Click here to watch."

21:48.590 --> 21:51.059
they released the sex tape.

21:51.093 --> 21:55.863
I know. I sold it.
I'm sorry. You did what?

21:55.898 --> 21:57.365
I did what was best for the film.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.734
We had to cover our investment.
Don't take it personally.

21:59.768 --> 22:01.502
Don't take it personally?

22:01.570 --> 22:04.972
You mean that my father
didn't consult me about this?

22:05.007 --> 22:06.874
That's kind of personal, dad.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.276
And on top of that what about Alex?

22:08.310 --> 22:11.179
How could you do that to her?
It was Alex's idea.

22:21.990 --> 22:24.659
Hey, Skills.
Hey, Millie.

22:24.693 --> 22:28.963
I need to ask you something.
Is it about Marvin and Lauren?

22:29.600 --> 22:32.100
Yeah.
You know about that?

22:32.123 --> 22:35.759
Yeah.
And you're not upset about it?

22:36.327 --> 22:40.430
Of course I'm upset,
but I want Marvin to be happy.

22:40.464 --> 22:46.136
So, why'd you come back?
I just missed my life here.

22:46.170 --> 22:48.438
It's hard starting over in a new place.

22:48.472 --> 22:50.840
It's hard starting over, period.

22:52.576 --> 22:54.544
Lauren was my girl.

22:54.578 --> 22:57.414
And Marvin was my guy,
but we took them for granted.

22:57.448 --> 23:00.150
I guess we made our beds,
and now we have to sleep in them.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.100
* after all

23:55.562 --> 23:57.029
hello?

23:57.064 --> 23:58.731
Haley! Thank God! Where are you?

23:58.765 --> 24:00.566
Um, I'm at home.

24:00.634 --> 24:03.202
Home. Well, what happened?
We're waiting for you.

24:03.237 --> 24:05.404
What are you waiting for?

24:05.439 --> 24:09.742
Um, your video shoot.
What is going on with you?

24:09.776 --> 24:12.945
Nothing. I just...
It's just music.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.380
Just music?

24:14.448 --> 24:16.916
Haley, we're spending 50,
000 dollars a day on this video,

24:16.950 --> 24:19.952
and I am not shooting sock puppets
in front of a white sheet!

24:19.987 --> 24:21.487
So get your ass back here now!

24:21.555 --> 24:24.423
I got to go.
Haley, I'm serious.

24:24.458 --> 24:25.958
Please tell me there's an emergency

24:25.993 --> 24:28.227
or... or give me some reason
I can sell to the label

24:28.262 --> 24:30.329
as an excuse for why you're
not onstage right now.

24:30.364 --> 24:35.001
I'm making soup. Haley...
Haley!

24:51.118 --> 24:52.919
They were in Katie's room.

24:52.986 --> 24:55.221
That's how I knew who you
were when you called.

24:55.289 --> 24:57.456
I just told her that I
wouldn't represent her...

24:57.491 --> 24:59.392
It's not you.

24:59.426 --> 25:01.694
I also found her lithium in the garbage.

25:01.728 --> 25:06.700
Her behavior gets a little...
Unpredictable without it.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.500
How unpredictable?

25:08.725 --> 25:12.227
Let's just say you should be careful.

25:39.656 --> 25:43.092
mom, I finished my puzzle.
You want to come see?

25:43.159 --> 25:44.726
Um, in a minute.

25:44.761 --> 25:48.030
Oh, are you making grandma's special soup?

25:48.064 --> 25:50.232
Oh, cool! Don't touch! Jamie!

25:50.266 --> 25:52.668
I didn't mean to... look...
look what you did! Go to your room!

25:52.702 --> 25:54.870
But, mom! Just go to your room!

26:24.147 --> 26:26.048
Haley...

26:27.851 --> 26:30.519
What happened?
They've been calling all day.

26:30.553 --> 26:32.387
You just... You just walked off the set?

26:32.455 --> 26:33.455
It's a big deal, babe.

26:35.859 --> 26:40.562
All right. Hey, hey. It's okay.
Just... I'll call them.

26:40.597 --> 26:43.365
You go upstairs and relax.
Let me clean this up.

26:43.399 --> 26:44.666
You know, I'm okay.

26:44.701 --> 26:46.969
I don't need any help.
I just want to be alone.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.864
It's gonna be okay, Haley...
I want to be alone.

27:14.120 --> 27:19.424
No comment.
Look, the thing is,

27:19.492 --> 27:20.925
we didn't want any of this to happen.

27:20.993 --> 27:22.127
We...

27:22.194 --> 27:25.397
Well, I wanted that to happen, obviously,

27:25.431 --> 27:26.898
but not so publicly.

27:30.803 --> 27:33.238
I don't understand why
you just didn't tell me.

27:33.306 --> 27:36.408
Should have.
I feel like an idiot, mother.

27:36.442 --> 27:37.842
I yelled at Paul

27:37.910 --> 27:39.744
because I thought he
stood you up for dinner.

27:39.812 --> 27:41.346
Why keep it a secret?

27:41.414 --> 27:44.015
Unless, of course, you're ashamed of it.

27:46.852 --> 27:48.720
Well, I've never been ashamed of it.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.755
We're not ashamed of it.

27:52.858 --> 27:56.661
Oh, my God.
Fine.

27:56.729 --> 27:59.331
If he makes you happy,
will be happy for you...

27:59.365 --> 28:03.601
So long as I do not have
to hear or see any more...

28:03.636 --> 28:06.400
Details.
Deal.

28:06.596 --> 28:12.266
And you... no more... 
You know, outwork.

28:12.567 --> 28:16.870
All work and no play promise.

28:19.007 --> 28:20.941
You're really okay with this coming out?

28:20.976 --> 28:22.843
Yeah, cool by me.

28:22.877 --> 28:29.083
Let the world know.
Clothes over bros.

28:29.117 --> 28:33.520
Yes.
Hello, TMZ.

28:33.588 --> 28:38.625
Uh-huh. That was actually my mother,
Victoria Davis.

28:38.693 --> 28:44.531
Yes.
V-i-c-t-o-r-i-a.

28:44.599 --> 28:47.701
Vocal track, take 1.

29:44.415 --> 29:46.716
hey, I have something of yours.

29:51.789 --> 29:53.923
thanks for letting it be
a part of my wardrobe.

29:53.991 --> 29:56.025
Every time I stepped onto set,
it reminded me

29:56.093 --> 29:57.694
that someone believed in me.

29:57.728 --> 30:01.197
And now that the film's wrapped,
well... thank you.

30:01.232 --> 30:04.033
Well, you've come a long way
since I gave you this watch.

30:06.337 --> 30:07.604
which is why I don't understand

30:07.638 --> 30:10.406
how you would allow Paul
to release the sex tape.

30:12.543 --> 30:14.344
hope you're not doing this for Josh.

30:14.411 --> 30:17.547
I didn't do it for Josh.

30:17.615 --> 30:22.185
I did it for you and the movie.
You saved my life... Literally.

30:22.219 --> 30:24.320
It was the least I could do.

30:26.557 --> 30:29.325
I needed to let you know
that I believe in you, too.

30:35.032 --> 30:37.667
Hey, what happened, man?

30:38.100 --> 30:39.600
You were almost finish with this thing.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.500
That's not work.

30:48.067 --> 30:49.534
Thank you.

30:49.769 --> 30:55.774
Is mom still mad at me?
it's not you, buddy.

30:58.111 --> 31:04.183
your mother really loves you.
She always will. Promise.

31:05.985 --> 31:08.387
Let's put this thing back together, huh?

31:53.333 --> 31:55.868
It's just missing one thing.

32:20.749 --> 32:24.585
I'll be right with you.
Watch the glass, please.

32:35.497 --> 32:37.699
Have an accident?

32:37.766 --> 32:42.370
Can I help you?
I'm here for Clay.

32:42.404 --> 32:44.906
I mean, my photo of Clay.

32:44.973 --> 32:46.908
I know I said you could send it to me,

32:46.975 --> 32:49.877
but I decided that I want him now.

32:49.912 --> 32:52.146
Well, that's unfortunate
because that print's

32:52.181 --> 32:54.248
already been shipped,
per your instructions.

32:54.283 --> 32:56.084
Could take weeks.

32:56.118 --> 32:58.886
So I guess you're gonna have to
get used to being without him.

33:01.190 --> 33:15.036
Excuse me.
Clay, she's here.

33:15.104 --> 33:17.939
Katie?
All right, Quinn, listen to me.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.800
I talked to her roommate,
Katie's unstable.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.500
Yeah, you're damn right. She's unstable.

33:22.534 --> 33:25.503
She's standing in my gallery
telling me that she wants you.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.571
She's about to see how unstable I can be.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.073
Quinn, I'm being serious.

33:29.141 --> 33:32.543
Just be careful and get the
hell out of there, okay? Please.

33:32.577 --> 33:35.245
Okay.
Promise me.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.647
Yeah, I promise.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.515
Um, I'll just tell her I'm
gonna close up and head home.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.850
Okay.

33:39.884 --> 33:42.186
And just call me as soon
as you get out of there.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.990
And, Quinn... I love you.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.592
I love you, too.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.097
I feel sorry for you.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.500
Can't you see how sad he is?

33:56.568 --> 33:59.503
Stop pretending like you
know him and leave us alone.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.039
That's cute. You said "us."

34:02.073 --> 34:05.042
But it was obvious he never
even told you about me.

34:05.076 --> 34:11.348
You need to go now.
I see the way he looks at you.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.083
But you don't know the way he looked at me

34:13.118 --> 34:14.385
the first time he saw me.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.489
He'll never look at you like that.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.623
You'll never be Sara.

34:21.192 --> 34:23.193
Neither will you.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.000
We'll see about that.

35:00.441 --> 35:04.945
I'm sorry I hurt you.
It's part of the game, bro.

35:06.648 --> 35:12.686
You know what I mean.
You there?

35:12.754 --> 35:14.321
Could we just play for a while?

35:14.355 --> 35:16.290
Sure.

35:37.879 --> 35:42.983
I miss her.
I know.

35:45.286 --> 35:48.589
Maybe you should focus
on your music, Haley.

35:48.623 --> 35:52.226
It will see you through.

35:52.293 --> 35:54.995
What if it doesn't?

35:58.099 --> 36:00.033
I'll be here.

36:07.408 --> 36:10.444
What's the difference between
a whore and Alex Dupre?

36:10.500 --> 36:13.100
The one is payed for sex and the
another do it for free.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.900
And another is a turns out
was it for Davis

36:16.007 --> 36:18.441
vacationing down under...
It was her mom.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.143
I guess cougars do live
in Australia.

36:21.312 --> 36:23.647
Okay, here's the deal.

36:23.714 --> 36:26.883
I'm tired of the entire
world thinking I'm a slut.

36:26.917 --> 36:28.218
Thinking?

36:28.252 --> 36:30.420
So at this moment,

36:30.454 --> 36:34.424
you and I are officially together.

36:34.458 --> 36:37.527
What are you talking about? The sex tape.

36:37.561 --> 36:39.729
I don't look as bad as if I
made it with my boyfriend...

36:39.730 --> 36:44.668
Who loves me
you're welcome.

36:54.679 --> 36:57.814
Wow. You look nice.

36:57.848 --> 37:00.417
Well, I was gonna get
dressed for a wrap party,

37:00.451 --> 37:02.152
but now I don't have to.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.587
To my boyfriend, Julian Baker

37:04.655 --> 37:08.158
who survived a day of sex,
lies, and videotapes.

37:08.192 --> 37:10.760
Nice.

37:12.263 --> 37:14.764
I almost forgot.
That came in the mail for you.

37:18.202 --> 37:20.837
"You and a guest have
been cordially invited

37:20.871 --> 37:23.707
"to attend the official unwrap party

37:23.774 --> 37:26.176
for 'seven dreams 'til Tuesday.'"

37:31.700 --> 37:35.500
Brooke Davis caught in a
sex act with her boy-toy.

37:48.355 --> 37:52.858
When I'm upset, I bake.
And I was really upset.

37:52.926 --> 37:58.597
Thanks.
Look, I'm sorry.

37:58.632 --> 38:00.833
I never meant to come between you guys.

38:00.867 --> 38:03.702
I don't know how to handle
all of this, Lauren.

38:03.737 --> 38:06.105
I don't, either.

38:06.139 --> 38:08.073
I just know I wanted to see you.

38:08.141 --> 38:12.177
I did, too.
But...

38:12.245 --> 38:14.747
I can't do this to my friend.

38:17.884 --> 38:19.952
I'm sorry.

39:33.249 --> 39:36.017
ancient architecture... *

39:36.052 --> 39:38.620
she's not gonna go away.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.700
And even what I said thing
this is just the beginning.

39:48.197 --> 39:51.366
priest on TV: And do you,
Sara take this man, Clay Evans,

39:51.400 --> 39:52.968

for better or for worse,

39:57.473 --> 40:02.043

to love and to cherish

40:02.078 --> 40:04.613

40:04.680 --> 40:06.381
I do. I do.

40:12.900 --> 40:16.113
Haley!
Move!

40:30.829 --> 40:33.964
Are you okay?

40:34.032 --> 40:38.002
Haley!

40:39.100 --> 40:41.300
I'm gonna go call my mum.
