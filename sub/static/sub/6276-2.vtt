WEBVTT

00:12.417 --> 00:13.458
Previously on Ray Donovan...
Yeah?

00:13.542 --> 00:15.500
We're fucked.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.375
Director's back.

00:16.458 --> 00:17.792
Either of you two guys
want to tell me

00:17.875 --> 00:20.250
who the fuck shot Sully?

00:20.333 --> 00:22.083
My father.
All right, I need

00:22.166 --> 00:23.667
your father in this office
right away.

00:23.750 --> 00:25.291
You got 24 hours.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.750
So you're still having
sex two times a day?

00:27.834 --> 00:30.000
Is it possible
he just likes to fuck?

00:30.083 --> 00:32.250
Until he can face
his molestation,

00:32.333 --> 00:34.208
I'm afraid your marriage
is going to be in trouble.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.917
RAY: We're gonna call
the kid's parents,

00:41.000 --> 00:42.083
go over to their house,
and we'll apologize.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.625
FRANCES:
What happened to him?

00:44.709 --> 00:47.375
TERRY: There's things
that I can't talk about.

00:47.458 --> 00:50.625
If you can't talk about these
things, then how can anything...

00:50.709 --> 00:53.000
Jesus, woman!

00:53.083 --> 00:54.792
This is who I am!

00:54.875 --> 00:57.041
We're loyal to each other!

01:00.709 --> 01:02.500
So, how big is this
guy? Is he big?

01:02.583 --> 01:04.959
MICKEY: He's Mexican--
how big could he be?

01:05.041 --> 01:07.291
Are you kidding me, Mickey?
That guy's fucking huge!

01:07.375 --> 01:08.917
You could take
this cocksucker.
(bell clangs)

01:13.208 --> 01:14.041
Yeah?

01:14.125 --> 01:15.709
DARYLL:
He's in Rosarito.

01:15.792 --> 01:16.875
Where in Rosarito?

01:16.959 --> 01:18.375
This place called Lucy's.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.208
COCHRAN: Hello?
RAY: I got him.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.333
All right, good.

Lot of fucking stars, huh?

02:21.875 --> 02:24.500
Remember that summer

02:24.583 --> 02:27.291
we rented that little
place in Wellfleet?

02:28.375 --> 02:30.542
Only summer we spent together.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.208
Only summer I wasn't in the can.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.166
Saved up some real money.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.917
Your mother wanted
a lobster dinner.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.709
Got 'em for her.
Three pounds each.

02:40.792 --> 02:42.875

went out for something.

Hundred bucks

03:03.834 --> 03:06.000
Your mother made us
bologna sandwiches that night.

03:06.083 --> 03:09.834
Best bologna sandwich
I ever ate.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.500
It wasn't all bad, Ray.

03:18.583 --> 03:21.250
Wasn't that the summer
you started fucking Claudette?

03:21.333 --> 03:23.709
That's why you were born, Ray,
to be my fucking judge.

03:23.792 --> 03:26.875
That's always been your job.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.500
What's on your mind, boy?

03:46.208 --> 03:47.417
Hey.

No.

Ed, look at me.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.917
This is your moment.

(cameras clicking)

04:24.583 --> 04:26.250
Good morning.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.125
If you were gonna kill me,
you'd have put two

04:31.208 --> 04:34.375
in the back of my head by now,
or had someone else do it.

04:34.458 --> 04:36.709
So what the fuck
are we doing here, Ray?

04:36.792 --> 04:38.750
The head of the FBI
wants to see you

04:38.834 --> 04:41.333
Oh, yeah? Great.

04:41.417 --> 04:43.208
They gonna give me
the $2 million reward

04:43.291 --> 04:44.709
they owe me
for killing Sully?

04:44.792 --> 04:46.875
They want to make sure
you keep your mouth shut.

04:46.959 --> 04:49.542
FBI killed Sully.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.500
Those fucking jerks
didn't do a fucking thing.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.333
Sully was hiding in plain sight
for 20 fucking years. (laughs)

04:54.417 --> 04:56.500
This ain't Van Miller, Mick.

04:56.583 --> 04:59.417
You want to go back
to your little hacienda,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.333
better play ball.

05:01.417 --> 05:03.375
You tell them what
they want to hear,

05:03.458 --> 05:05.458
they'll turn you around
and send you right back.

05:05.542 --> 05:06.667
Sounds good,

05:06.750 --> 05:10.250
but how are they gonna make sure
I keep my mouth shut, Ray?

05:10.333 --> 05:12.583
You know what they got planned?

05:12.667 --> 05:15.041
(closes zipper)

05:15.125 --> 05:17.583
I'll be all right,

05:17.667 --> 05:19.792
no matter what happens.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.041
The fuck you waving at?

05:36.125 --> 05:38.959
A friend.

05:39.041 --> 05:41.500
I had a spiritual awakening.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.000
Banging whores

05:45.083 --> 05:46.583
and getting
your kid beat up?

05:46.667 --> 05:49.083
That's some spiritual
awakening, Mick.

05:49.166 --> 05:52.083
You wouldn't understand.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.542
COCHRAN:
As you know,

05:54.625 --> 05:57.458
under my direction,
we've been tracking Patrick...

05:57.542 --> 06:01.000
"Sully" Sullivan for...
many years now.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.083
It was during the course
of that investigation

06:02.166 --> 06:04.417
that one of our own,

06:04.500 --> 06:06.709
Special Agent Van Miller,

06:06.792 --> 06:09.542
was tragically shot and killed
by Mr. Sullivan.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.041
But Agent Miller
did not die in vain.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.375
Through the heroism

06:13.458 --> 06:15.917
and the quick work
of Agents Volcheck and Barnes,

06:16.041 --> 06:19.000
we were able to bring down
America's Most Wanted.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.333
I'll take some questions now.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.166
REPORTER: How long was Sully
in Los Angeles?

06:22.250 --> 06:23.458
COCHRAN: This is
an ongoing investigation,

06:23.542 --> 06:25.250
so we can't release
all the details,

06:25.333 --> 06:28.792
but I can say
that he was in L.A.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.709
for at least
six to eight months.

06:30.792 --> 06:31.709
Bullshit.

06:33.709 --> 06:37.208
I need you to send me to L.A.
They're lying about Sully.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.834
Why would
the FBI lie?

06:39.917 --> 06:43.125
That's why I need to go
to L.A.-- to find out, Bob.

06:43.208 --> 06:45.375
I'm not sending you to L.A.
on a hunch.

06:45.458 --> 06:46.959
It's not the
old days.

06:47.041 --> 06:47.959
I don't have the dough.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.667
Okay, here's the deal--
you give me a day,

06:50.750 --> 06:52.709
I bring you something,
you fly me out.

06:52.792 --> 06:54.917
(sighs)

06:55.000 --> 06:56.625
MICKEY:
I like this.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.166
I'm used to Ban-Lon.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.166
What the fuck is this?

07:00.250 --> 07:02.583
It's called cotton, Mick.

07:07.291 --> 07:10.583
I know where you buried
the body of that priest, Ray.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.667
This goes wrong for me,
you're fucked.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.709
I'll spill.

07:21.792 --> 07:24.500
Spill all you want, Mick.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.250
Just remember, you do that,
Terry, Bunch, Daryll--

07:27.333 --> 07:30.709
they all go to prison,
not just me.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.041
He's waiting for you.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.625
All right.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.041
(clears throat)

07:47.125 --> 07:50.375
I'm Mickey Donovan.
Where's my fucking reward?

07:50.458 --> 07:51.792
$2 million for shooting Sully.

07:51.875 --> 07:55.500
You think I give a shit
about a 75-year-old gangster?

07:55.583 --> 07:57.041
You know who
I care about?

07:57.125 --> 07:58.041
Mohammed, Abdul

07:58.125 --> 07:59.208
and Hakim.

07:59.291 --> 08:01.792
Fitzie, Murphy and O'Donahue?

08:01.875 --> 08:04.917
I really couldn't give a shit
about you potato-eating,

08:05.000 --> 08:05.959
Riverdancing motherfuckers.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.834
Oh.

08:07.917 --> 08:11.250
So...

08:11.333 --> 08:15.083
the days of you making
your own decisions are over.

08:15.166 --> 08:15.959
What are you talking about?

08:16.041 --> 08:17.959
These papers...

08:18.041 --> 08:19.375
put you on parole
for the next five years.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.792
But if you
don't behave,

08:22.875 --> 08:25.709
these papers put you away
for the rest of your life.

08:25.792 --> 08:27.417
You go to Leavenworth as
a material witness to a crime.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.667
MICKEY: Oh, yeah?
Which one?

08:30.750 --> 08:32.250
I don't know.
Anything I fucking want.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.458
How about, uh,
the assassination of JFK?

08:34.542 --> 08:37.000
Now, get the fuck
out of my office

08:37.083 --> 08:40.333
and go report to
your parole officer.

08:40.417 --> 08:43.375
Parole officer?
I'm a goddamn patriot.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.417
I ratted out 20 guys

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
for you people.

08:46.583 --> 08:48.583
You know... you know
the danger I was in?

08:48.667 --> 08:49.917
I wore a wire for you.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.417
For me? I don't think so.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.083
Did you wear a wire
for Van Miller?

08:59.291 --> 09:01.250
Now, which one
of you motherfuckers

09:01.333 --> 09:03.375
killed him?

09:03.458 --> 09:04.917
He's dead?

09:06.667 --> 09:08.041
(chuckles softly)

09:08.125 --> 09:09.166
I ain't going on parole.

09:09.250 --> 09:12.291
I know.
That's fine.

09:12.375 --> 09:14.500
You're on the next
flight to Guantanamo.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.625
You can be roomies
with the Blind Sheikh.

09:16.709 --> 09:18.875
As-salamu alaykum,
motherfucker.

09:20.792 --> 09:21.667
Here's how it's gonna work.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.625
You don't open
your mouth about Sully.

09:23.709 --> 09:26.333
You weren't on the docks
that night.

09:26.417 --> 09:27.917
And you didn't kill him.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.083
Frank did.
End of story.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.166
Can I talk to you... alone?

09:33.250 --> 09:36.125
Yeah. Wait outside, huh?

09:36.208 --> 09:39.583
Yeah, you-you two work it out.
Work it out.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.750
(exhales)

09:45.125 --> 09:46.375
(sighs)

09:46.458 --> 09:48.125
This isn't smart.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.709
You're not making
the right play here.

09:49.792 --> 09:52.792
Believe me, it's a hell
of a lot better for both of us

09:52.875 --> 09:54.000
if he stays in Mexico.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.792
Us? There's no "us" here, Ray.

09:55.875 --> 09:59.333
I'm sorry, are you the Director
of the L.A. Bureau of the FBI?

09:59.417 --> 10:01.500
Look, Cochran, I don't want
to tell you your job,

10:01.583 --> 10:02.750
but my father...

10:02.834 --> 10:03.875
(sighs)

10:03.959 --> 10:05.125
You don't want him around.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.875
You put him on parole, you
won't be able to control him.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.166
Well, I'm not gonna control him,
Ray, you are.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.000
'Cause if he fucks up,
guess what.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.542
You're going to Leavenworth
with him.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.875
You guys can share a cell.

10:17.959 --> 10:21.667
Now, get the fuck out of here,
and take that asshole with you.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.667
I said you could go, Donovan.

10:35.250 --> 10:38.208
What the fuck
are you looking at?

10:38.291 --> 10:38.834
Your mom.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.417
Hey, Ray, uh,

10:44.500 --> 10:47.250
I know how you
got to Frank,

10:47.333 --> 10:49.458
but I don't have
a second family.

10:49.542 --> 10:52.500
So I guess
you can't fuck with me.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.834
Couldn't let me
live my life?

11:03.917 --> 11:05.250
You set me up,
motherfucker.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.834
You knew this was
gonna happen.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.291
You think I want you
back here? Huh?

11:09.375 --> 11:10.250
Think anybody does?

11:10.333 --> 11:12.750
You know what?

11:12.834 --> 11:15.083
Some of these parole
officers aren't so bad.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.625
Nothing I can't handle.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.417
Do what you're told, Mick,
you understand?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.125
Sure, and if it
ain't all right,

11:20.208 --> 11:22.542
I'll blow town, go back
to Mexico. Fuck it.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.417
Go back to Mexico,
you'll end up dead.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.458
Dead?

11:25.542 --> 11:28.458
You're getting
paranoid, Ray.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.709
Drop your stuff off,

11:31.792 --> 11:33.417
and we go see
that parole officer.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.417
What's your hurry, Ray?

11:39.208 --> 11:41.166
(men grunting, punches landing)

11:43.208 --> 11:44.542
Boys.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.417
I'm back.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.625
Fucking funeral.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.709
Say hi to your dad.

12:03.041 --> 12:05.875
Hey, Bunch.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.333
DARYLL: What are you
doing back here, Mick?

12:08.417 --> 12:09.625
What are you talking about?

12:09.709 --> 12:11.875
You think I'm gonna
walk out on my family?

12:11.959 --> 12:13.083
They just put me

12:13.166 --> 12:15.333
on parole, boys.
I thought I was gonna

12:15.417 --> 12:16.792
go back to Walpole
for a minute there.

12:16.875 --> 12:16.959
Here we go.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.500
Let's celebrate.

12:22.583 --> 12:22.834
He's sober, Mick.

12:24.750 --> 12:28.041
I got a job, Pop.

12:28.125 --> 12:30.083
Ain't that something!

12:30.166 --> 12:31.834
That's great, Bunch.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.000
That's great.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.458
Didn't we have fun down there?

12:37.083 --> 12:39.291
Come on,
let it go.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.959
You got hit. It happens.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.583
The most important thing
is to get back up.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.125
Got to keep
pushing forward.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.250
Choo-choo-choo-choo,
choo-choo-choo-choo.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.500
Climb the mountain.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.291
Choo-choo-choo-choo.
I can get there.

12:51.375 --> 12:52.458
Yeah.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.875
I'm there. Victory.

12:57.417 --> 12:58.834
All right, get back to work.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.375
Ray.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.166
Don't leave.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.166
I know a lot of
bad shit happened.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.208
But it'll be better.

13:09.291 --> 13:12.542
I'm stronger now.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.875
Everything's gonna be okay.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.959
I know it is, Bunch.

13:26.417 --> 13:28.709
I need the name of every parole
officer in the Hollywood office

13:28.792 --> 13:31.583
and their Social Security
numbers.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.875
You're an FBI agent, Frank.

13:35.959 --> 13:37.041
Figure it out.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.041
(chuckles)

14:06.500 --> 14:10.208
(chuckling):
Ray, what are you doing?

14:10.291 --> 14:12.000
Seriously, Ray?
Shh.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.208
Ray, sweetheart, hold on.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.542
Ray, no.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.083
No, I said no. I said no.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.083
I said no.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.083
I can't... keep doing this.
I feel raped.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.083
Raped?

14:45.709 --> 14:48.709
You fucking kidding me?

14:49.667 --> 14:51.750
(sighs)

15:06.166 --> 15:09.583
I talked to Dr. Finkel
about it.

15:10.959 --> 15:14.917
Do you even know
how rough you are?

15:15.542 --> 15:18.458
My pussy hurts.

15:21.542 --> 15:24.125
I can barely walk
some days.

15:27.917 --> 15:30.875
You told me what happened
with that priest.

15:31.917 --> 15:35.583
We can't pretend
it didn't happen.

15:36.709 --> 15:40.250
I want to be close to you.
I do, sweetheart.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.625
Will you answer me?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.250
WOMAN:
Mrs. Sullivan?

15:57.333 --> 16:00.375
I'm Kate McPherson
from The Boston Globe.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.709
We spoke a few years ago.

16:02.792 --> 16:05.041
I'm writing a book
about your son.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.917
Look...

16:07.000 --> 16:09.709
I want to tell
your side of the story.

16:09.792 --> 16:10.959
I know he was
a good son to you,

16:11.041 --> 16:13.625
and I don't think
he would've left you

16:13.709 --> 16:15.667
unless there was
some compelling reason.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.750
Do you know
what that was?

16:23.834 --> 16:26.792
They say he was in L.A.
for a few months.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.041
And I don't think that's true.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.834
Do you think
Catherine was with him?

16:34.917 --> 16:38.083
I know she was in hiding
with him for 20 years.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.208
I'd like to talk to her.

16:43.417 --> 16:48.709
Catherine-- she always took
me to get my hair done.

16:50.125 --> 16:53.083
When's the last time
she did that?

16:54.792 --> 16:57.625
I got nobody now.

16:57.709 --> 17:01.583
Sully was the
last one left.

17:02.208 --> 17:04.709
Fucking Mickey Donovan.

17:04.792 --> 17:06.083
Piece of shit.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.959
Fucking... rat.

17:09.041 --> 17:13.000
All because he was fucking
that nigger.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.291
(sighs)

17:24.375 --> 17:25.792
(phone ringing)

17:25.875 --> 17:27.166
Yeah, boss.

17:27.250 --> 17:28.041
Lena, I need you and Avi
to get me

17:28.125 --> 17:29.125
everything you can
on Ed Cochran.

17:29.208 --> 17:32.834
What, uh...
the head of the L.A. FBI?

17:32.917 --> 17:34.417
Yeah, I know who he fucking is.
Just do it.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.917
Be careful.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Okay.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.333
Hey, little dude, what's up?

17:50.417 --> 17:51.291
CONOR:
Nothing.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.875
I'm at home. I'm suspended.

17:52.959 --> 17:55.583
Awesome.
(knocking)

17:56.792 --> 17:58.875
What you doing, kiddo?

17:58.959 --> 18:01.291
Nothing, Dad.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.792
All right.

18:04.875 --> 18:05.834
See you later.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.709
Hey, check this out.

18:08.792 --> 18:09.667
Say hi, Conor.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.500
Hi, Conor.

18:11.583 --> 18:12.792
(laughs)

18:12.875 --> 18:14.500
Whoa.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.208
(ringtone playing)

18:19.250 --> 18:20.709
Hey, Tommy, I got to go.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.375
All right, little dude. Adios.

18:22.458 --> 18:23.500
(snorts)

18:24.834 --> 18:26.166
Con, it's your Grandpa.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.166
Hi, Grandpa.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.375
You still in Mexico?

18:28.458 --> 18:29.542
No, kiddo. I'm back.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.834
What are you, between classes?

18:31.917 --> 18:32.667
No, I got suspended.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.667
Oh, yeah?
Mendez,

18:35.750 --> 18:38.583
you're late. Get in there.
I got suspended, too.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.041
What'd you do?

18:41.125 --> 18:43.750
I pushed a kid down the stairs.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.000
He broke his collarbone.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.208
You pushed him from behind?

18:48.291 --> 18:49.500
Yeah.

18:49.583 --> 18:53.542
Oh, Conor,
I-I can't condone that.

18:53.625 --> 18:54.875
Can you come over?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.500
I would if I could.

18:56.583 --> 18:57.542
I got my hands full.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.250
I can't go anywhere
for a few days

18:59.333 --> 19:01.792
until I sort some things out,
but I'm at the gym.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.625
We got to talk this through.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.750
Mickey Donovan?

19:06.834 --> 19:09.333
Uh, just a second.
I'm on with my grandson.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.875
I got to call you back.
I love you, Con.

19:11.959 --> 19:13.375
Miss you.

19:16.208 --> 19:17.333
That's me, sweetheart.

19:29.917 --> 19:32.792
(phone ringing)

19:34.667 --> 19:35.625
EZRA:
Where are you?

19:35.709 --> 19:38.625
Trousdale.

19:38.709 --> 19:40.208
Trousdale? You're nearby.

19:40.291 --> 19:42.542
I need you to come here now.

19:42.625 --> 19:45.250
It's all happening, Raymond.

19:51.166 --> 19:54.750
I need you to pee
in a cup for me.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.917
I might need
some help.

19:57.000 --> 19:57.625
Enough with the jokes.

19:57.709 --> 20:00.417
Go pee.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.709
Listen, I got to be
honest with you.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.625
I had a little drop this morning
making a toast with my boys.

20:06.709 --> 20:10.291
I didn't know this was gonna
be part of our visit.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.709
It won't happen again.

20:13.792 --> 20:16.458
All right.

20:16.542 --> 20:18.041
You get a pass this time.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.875
But we'll do it next week.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.542
Thank you
for telling me.

20:22.625 --> 20:23.458
You're a sweetheart, Lupita.

20:23.542 --> 20:26.625
You and me are gonna
get along great.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.417
You got real
humanity in you.

20:31.583 --> 20:33.250
(scoffs)

20:35.291 --> 20:37.291
Hey, Deb.
Hey.

20:38.834 --> 20:43.000
Ezra just put me in charge
of fundraising for the RGOCC.

20:43.917 --> 20:45.500
Congratulations.

20:45.583 --> 20:48.500
God, it feels great
to be out in the open.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.625
Did you give these to Abby?

20:50.709 --> 20:52.500
Yeah, I did.

20:52.583 --> 20:53.834
What is it with her
and Trousdale?

20:53.917 --> 20:57.959
I tried to get her interested
in Brentwood, in the Palisades.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.291
She liked this one, huh?

20:59.375 --> 21:01.500
She fell in love
with that house.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.417
We have
a problem, Raymond.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.959
When I was sick, people
didn't honor their pledges.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.333
We need to build now.

21:09.417 --> 21:12.041
June Wilson
pledged $5 million,

21:12.125 --> 21:14.125
and now I can't get her
on the phone.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.208
Leave her alone, Ezra.

21:15.291 --> 21:16.250
Leave her alone?

21:16.333 --> 21:18.208
Do you know
what that woman owes me?

21:18.291 --> 21:21.417
Do you know the things
I've done for her?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.917
I need you
to go take care of this.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.291
She pledged the money.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.291
Now she's got to make it good.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.000
Could you excuse us
for a sec?

21:30.083 --> 21:32.208
Of course, Ray.

21:37.709 --> 21:39.542
Listen to me.

21:39.625 --> 21:42.709
I've worked for you
for 20 years, Ezra.

21:42.792 --> 21:45.041
Trust me, right now,

21:45.125 --> 21:47.208
June Wilson is the least
of your problems.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.542
Is the FBI coming to arrest me?

21:51.125 --> 21:53.041
I'm taking care of that.

21:53.125 --> 21:54.125
Then what's the problem?

21:54.208 --> 21:56.083
I need that money, Raymond.

21:56.166 --> 21:58.083
Tikkun olam.

21:59.458 --> 22:00.500
All right.

22:00.583 --> 22:01.208
MAN:
Good job today, guys.

22:01.291 --> 22:04.083
Blessings.
Beautiful practice.

22:04.166 --> 22:07.458
Tomorrow at 10:30,
Ashtanga level two.

22:07.542 --> 22:11.166
Okay? Blessings,
everybody. Bye.

22:16.917 --> 22:19.750
Abby?

22:29.417 --> 22:33.542
You're looking at me
like you see me.

22:35.125 --> 22:38.166
I-I do see you.

22:45.917 --> 22:48.917
Do you?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.750
Do you really see me?

22:51.834 --> 22:55.000
I do, Abby.

brother's following me?

24:46.125 --> 24:49.417
Did you send him?

24:49.500 --> 24:50.583
No.

24:52.250 --> 24:56.542
Look, I know
who you are.

24:56.625 --> 24:59.125
I know what you did.
I was there.

24:59.208 --> 25:02.709
That man is dead.

25:02.792 --> 25:06.208
I don't care how it happened.

25:06.291 --> 25:09.709
I need you to know that you
don't have to worry about me.

25:12.792 --> 25:16.375
And I need to know
that my family's okay.

25:16.458 --> 25:20.041
I can't keep looking
over my shoulder.

25:23.959 --> 25:25.834
Your family's safe.

25:25.917 --> 25:29.333
I don't believe you.

25:29.417 --> 25:33.083
We both know
what I saw.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.834
What'd you see?

25:34.917 --> 25:38.083
Are you playing games with me?

25:41.417 --> 25:45.000
What'd you see?

25:48.125 --> 25:50.000
I didn't see anything.

25:57.375 --> 25:58.834
Tell Terry to leave me alone.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.583
Frances.

26:15.959 --> 26:18.959
Frances, why won't
you talk to me?

26:19.041 --> 26:21.750
Leave me the fuck alone!

26:31.375 --> 26:32.625
What did you say?

26:32.709 --> 26:35.208
You threaten her?
She came to me.

26:35.291 --> 26:37.667
Bullshit.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.625
RAY:
The fuck you doing here?

26:39.709 --> 26:41.083

Come on. Come on,
Ray. Come-come...

26:41.166 --> 26:43.250
Come on.
Stop!

Fight me. Fight me!

26:45.333 --> 26:47.417

26:48.875 --> 26:51.792
I'm not fighting you, Terry.

26:56.750 --> 27:00.625
What did you do?
What did you tell her?

27:00.709 --> 27:02.333
What she needed to hear.

27:03.917 --> 27:05.750
There's a body.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.542
We killed a fucking priest--
could get dug up any day now--

27:07.625 --> 27:10.166
and she knows who put him there.

27:12.458 --> 27:13.375
She's not gonna say anything.

27:13.458 --> 27:16.458
Oh, come on, Terry.

27:16.542 --> 27:19.208
She's got a fucking family!

27:23.000 --> 27:25.083
She chose him.

27:25.166 --> 27:27.083
What more you need to know?

27:41.041 --> 27:42.917
How often did you see her?

27:43.000 --> 27:43.667
Once a month.

27:43.750 --> 27:47.375
She called every week.
Always.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.166
And the last time
you spoke to her?

27:49.250 --> 27:52.417
She called me
on her way to California.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.750
She and Sully
were in New Mexico.

27:54.834 --> 27:57.625
And when was that?

27:57.709 --> 28:00.250
A month ago maybe.

28:03.917 --> 28:05.834
Do you have a picture of her

28:05.917 --> 28:07.667
from the last
few years?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.417
Yeah.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.875
I got something recent.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.667
It's her and Baby.

28:19.750 --> 28:22.333
She had a baby?

28:22.417 --> 28:25.125
No, her dog, Baby.

28:25.208 --> 28:27.291
Oh.

28:28.959 --> 28:29.917
Can I keep this?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.583
No.

28:32.667 --> 28:33.875
Oh, okay. Hold on.

28:36.417 --> 28:38.417
Just gonna
take a photo.

28:55.709 --> 28:57.000
MICKEY:
See?

28:57.083 --> 28:57.917
Normal gym.

29:00.709 --> 29:02.291
This is where I sleep.

29:02.375 --> 29:05.375
I know it's a little tight
for the two of us.

29:05.458 --> 29:06.458
(laughs)

29:06.542 --> 29:08.917
Stop with the lip, Mickey.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.959
I had enough.
Conor!

29:11.041 --> 29:13.291
Conor, what are
you doing here?

29:13.375 --> 29:15.041
You told me
we needed to talk.

29:15.125 --> 29:15.500
How'd you get here?

29:15.583 --> 29:16.417
I took Uber.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.667
Uber? What the hell is that?

29:18.750 --> 29:19.291
Lupita,
this is my... this is

29:19.375 --> 29:22.083
my grandson.

29:22.166 --> 29:24.875
He's the one in charge of
keeping me out of trouble.

29:24.959 --> 29:26.083
Nice to meet you.

29:26.166 --> 29:26.834
Go put some,
uh, wraps on.

29:26.917 --> 29:28.834
Maybe we'll do
some bag work.

29:28.917 --> 29:30.834
I got to finish up
with the lady.
Okay.

29:34.166 --> 29:36.458
No, that's okay.
We're done.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.417
I'll see you
same time next week.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.333
You got to start to look
for a job, okay?

29:41.417 --> 29:43.458
Sure thing.
No problem.

30:31.792 --> 30:33.333
(sighs)

30:48.000 --> 30:49.500
He's down 10K.

30:49.583 --> 30:52.291
Where is he?

30:52.375 --> 30:54.375
The large
black man.

31:19.542 --> 31:22.375
(sighs)

31:41.667 --> 31:44.458
Buy you a drink?

31:44.542 --> 31:46.625
I don't feel
like talking.

31:47.542 --> 31:49.500
Rough day, huh?

31:50.667 --> 31:53.291
Are you fucking deaf?

31:53.375 --> 31:55.583
I just told you
I don't want to talk.

32:38.917 --> 32:41.709
So, I said...

32:41.792 --> 32:44.834
"Sheila, baby,

32:44.917 --> 32:48.458
what the hell do you want
with a $15,000 wedding dress?"

32:48.542 --> 32:50.500
And she said, "Daddy,

32:50.583 --> 32:52.709
"it's so beautiful,

32:52.792 --> 32:54.917
and it's my wedding."

32:57.917 --> 32:59.875
(chuckles)

32:59.959 --> 33:03.500
I mean, this kid has
never asked me for a dime.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.625
Nothing.

33:05.709 --> 33:07.417
Paid her own way
through college.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.625
Graduated with honors.

33:09.709 --> 33:12.041
You got a daughter?

33:12.125 --> 33:14.083
Yeah, sure.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.750
Love of my life.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.792
And it's all gone.

33:26.041 --> 33:29.458
I can't believe I
fucked up this bad.

33:33.083 --> 33:36.291
Oh, you stupid...

33:36.375 --> 33:38.625
sorry ass
motherfucker!

33:43.375 --> 33:45.417
(sighs)

33:45.500 --> 33:47.458
What is wrong
with you, nigga?

33:51.792 --> 33:53.959
(groans)

33:54.041 --> 33:55.917
$15,000.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.583
(sighs)

33:57.667 --> 33:59.709
That's a lot
for a parole officer.

34:07.750 --> 34:09.709
Who the fuck are you?

34:09.792 --> 34:12.834
I'm Ray Donovan.

34:21.875 --> 34:23.333
Come here.
(clears throat)

34:23.417 --> 34:24.375
Come here.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.500
Oh! You fucking asshole!

34:29.583 --> 34:30.792
See what that
feels like?

34:30.875 --> 34:32.458
That's a bitch move.

34:32.542 --> 34:35.709
In the can, you do enough of
those, and they'll shank you.

34:35.792 --> 34:38.458
You won't even
see it coming.

34:38.917 --> 34:41.750
Sorry, Grandpa.

34:41.834 --> 34:43.625
A good man feels bad
when he does something wrong.

34:43.709 --> 34:45.500
You understand?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.917
Yes.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.375
All right.

34:49.458 --> 34:51.333
What did your father
say about what happened?

34:51.417 --> 34:54.583
He was supposed to take me
to the kid's house to apologize.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.166
Apologize?

34:56.250 --> 34:56.667
Donovans don't
apologize.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.166
But you just said,

34:59.250 --> 35:00.000
"A good man feels bad
when he does something wrong."

35:00.083 --> 35:03.000
But he don't tell
no one about it.

35:03.083 --> 35:04.333
That's for you.

35:04.417 --> 35:06.083
You got to pay attention
to what I'm saying.

35:06.166 --> 35:08.583
What kind of a man
do you want to be?

35:08.667 --> 35:10.667
Who are you? You want
to be a good man?

35:10.750 --> 35:13.375
A man who loves, forgives,
embraces his family?

35:13.458 --> 35:15.667
You want to be a captain
or a sailor, Con?

35:15.750 --> 35:18.041
I saw some tits today.

35:18.125 --> 35:19.667
Tits.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.667
Man, that's for babies.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.000
When you get older,
it's all about ass.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.166
You know, Con,
I met this woman.

35:25.250 --> 35:29.000
She didn't have much of
an ass, but I liked her.

35:29.083 --> 35:29.667
She got into a
bad situation.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.917
What happened?

35:32.000 --> 35:34.083
Wrong place, wrong time.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.709
It was a tragedy. Real tragedy.

35:36.792 --> 35:38.542
Ever have a girl die on you?

35:38.625 --> 35:41.125
Get to a certain age,

35:41.208 --> 35:43.667
they start dying on
you left and right.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.250
(sniffles)

35:46.333 --> 35:48.125
It's gonna be a
great year, Con.

35:48.208 --> 35:49.000
MAN:
Hey, look here.

35:49.083 --> 35:52.041
I can take him
away from Lupita.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.542
That I can do.

35:54.625 --> 35:58.291
But this other shit
you're asking...

35:58.375 --> 35:59.709
I can't just make
up rules here.

35:59.792 --> 36:01.041
All right.

36:01.125 --> 36:03.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

36:03.875 --> 36:05.500
Where you going?

36:05.583 --> 36:09.750
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around it, that's all.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.750
(sighs)

36:13.375 --> 36:15.792
(quietly):
Sit down.

36:20.291 --> 36:23.000
I could go to jail
for this shit.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.375
I put people
back in the hole.

36:25.458 --> 36:27.500
I don't want
to go there.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.417
Now, what is that?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.375
Yacht-master?

36:43.583 --> 36:45.667
Submariner?

36:54.417 --> 36:56.375
It's a Daytona.

36:56.458 --> 36:57.917
Oh, yeah.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.333
(chuckles)

37:07.542 --> 37:09.417
(phone chimes)

37:25.834 --> 37:27.083
(phone ringing)

37:27.166 --> 37:28.417
ABBY:
Conor's at the gym.

37:28.500 --> 37:28.917
He's what?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.250
He's at the gym.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.750
How'd he get there?

37:32.834 --> 37:34.083
He took Uber, Ray.

37:34.166 --> 37:35.667
You got him an Uber account?

37:35.750 --> 37:36.959
I'm tired of being a chauffeur.

37:37.041 --> 37:38.667
They track the drivers.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.875
(sighs)

37:40.959 --> 37:42.750
I'll go get him.

37:42.834 --> 37:44.917
Thanks.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.458
(sighs)

37:53.041 --> 37:55.125
Goddamn it.

37:57.458 --> 37:58.417
(sighs)

38:06.041 --> 38:07.917
MICKEY:
Jab, cross.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.041
(punches landing)

38:09.125 --> 38:10.500
That's the way
you're gonna hit?

38:10.583 --> 38:13.250
Bah, bah? Come on.
You got to bing, bing!

38:13.333 --> 38:15.709
Let's go. Put some
snap into it, okay?

38:15.792 --> 38:17.083
Jab, cross.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.709
You want to fight or not?

38:18.792 --> 38:21.709
I don't know.

38:21.792 --> 38:23.709
Jab, cross.
Let's go.

38:24.583 --> 38:28.250
Oh. Oh, you are.
You are a fighter.

38:28.333 --> 38:30.458
Now you feel it, see?
That's...

38:30.542 --> 38:32.709
What's the matter?

38:32.792 --> 38:35.250
Let's go, Con.

38:35.333 --> 38:38.667
No! You told me you
were gonna take me

38:38.750 --> 38:39.458
to that kid's house
to apologize.

38:39.542 --> 38:42.291
What kind of man
am I gonna be?

38:42.375 --> 38:43.750
Donovans don't
apologize.

38:43.834 --> 38:46.333
You were gonna try
to make me a bitch!

38:46.417 --> 38:48.625
Uh, let's get
those gloves off, huh?

38:54.041 --> 38:56.542
Abby, me darlin'.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.333
Conor, let's go.

38:58.417 --> 39:00.750
Good work, kiddo.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.250
Welcome home, Mick.

39:28.458 --> 39:31.083
When were you gonna
tell me, Ray?

39:31.166 --> 39:33.250
Listen to me. I went to Mexico
and brought him back.

39:33.333 --> 39:35.250
I thought
it was gonna be one day.

39:35.333 --> 39:38.625
Then they put him on parole.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.500
It's out of my hands.
You think I want him here?

39:40.583 --> 39:43.750
I'm so fucking tired
of you lying to me.

39:43.834 --> 39:45.542
It's so belittling.

39:45.625 --> 39:46.959
I'm your partner.

39:47.041 --> 39:49.625
You keeping this from me
makes me feel like a child.

39:52.417 --> 39:54.291
You don't want this to work.

39:54.375 --> 39:55.625
You don't want to
save this marriage.

39:59.542 --> 40:00.709
I didn't know it needed saving.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.208
Maybe you should think about it.

40:14.709 --> 40:16.625
(car door closes)

40:16.709 --> 40:17.667
(engine starts)

40:17.750 --> 40:18.750
KATE:
Sully's girlfriend

40:18.834 --> 40:22.542
called her mother
from New Mexico three weeks ago.

40:22.625 --> 40:24.417
She and Sully were on their way

40:24.500 --> 40:26.417
to California.
That's interesting.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.959
The FBI has said
that Sully was in L.A.

40:30.041 --> 40:32.458
for six to eight months.

40:33.458 --> 40:34.625
Don't you get it?

40:34.709 --> 40:36.375
Sully wasn't in L.A.
six months ago.

40:36.458 --> 40:37.709
The FBI is lying.

40:37.792 --> 40:40.208
Maybe they went back and forth.
How the fuck do you know?

40:40.291 --> 40:43.000
I'm not sending you to L.A.

40:43.083 --> 40:45.375
I'm going, Bob. See ya.

40:45.458 --> 40:45.917
Kate.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.500
See ya.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.667
You're fired.

41:06.834 --> 41:08.500
(phone ringing)

41:10.792 --> 41:12.166
Hey.

41:12.250 --> 41:13.208
LENA: Hey.
Where are you?

41:13.291 --> 41:15.333
He just left the office.

41:15.417 --> 41:16.583
Heading home to Northridge?

41:16.667 --> 41:18.458
No, no, no, he's heading
towards the airport.

41:19.417 --> 41:20.709
Hmm.

41:20.792 --> 41:22.208
All right.

41:22.291 --> 41:24.333
Stay on him.

41:26.291 --> 41:28.375
(laughs)

41:34.417 --> 41:36.500
Uh...

41:37.959 --> 41:40.792
Why don't you go
for a smoke, okay?

41:40.875 --> 41:41.583
All right?

41:46.375 --> 41:47.667
How are you?

41:54.250 --> 41:55.834
You in love again?

41:55.917 --> 41:57.208
No.

41:57.291 --> 41:58.709
(chuckles):
No.

41:58.792 --> 42:00.125
You want me
to check him out?

42:00.208 --> 42:01.625
No.

42:01.709 --> 42:04.667
No, I think I can
handle this one myself.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.667
(laughing)

42:06.750 --> 42:08.458
All right.

42:08.542 --> 42:09.583
Hey, gorgeous.

42:09.667 --> 42:11.709
Hey, gorgeous, yourself.

42:11.792 --> 42:12.667
Hello.

42:12.750 --> 42:14.917
Louis, how are you tonight?

42:15.000 --> 42:16.625
Fine, thank you.
Oh, good.

42:16.709 --> 42:19.083
Uh, this gentleman
will have the Lagavulin

42:19.166 --> 42:22.208
25... Is that right?
Did I say it...

42:22.291 --> 42:23.291
Okay, good.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.125
Um...

42:25.208 --> 42:27.125
I'll have another one of these.

42:33.333 --> 42:36.709
Okay. Ezra wants his money?

42:36.792 --> 42:39.500
Yeah.

42:39.583 --> 42:42.583
He's really obsessed with
this hospital, isn't he?

42:42.667 --> 42:45.375
It's his legacy.

42:46.834 --> 42:48.542
How much did I pledge?

42:50.625 --> 42:51.875
$5 million.

42:53.375 --> 42:55.750
$5 million?

42:55.834 --> 42:57.166
$5 million?

42:57.250 --> 43:00.875
I must have been drunk.

43:00.959 --> 43:03.083
You want me to check you
in to that place

43:03.166 --> 43:04.125
for a couple of weeks?

43:04.208 --> 43:05.375
No.

43:05.458 --> 43:08.417
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

43:17.750 --> 43:19.834
What do you want me
to tell him, June?

43:23.208 --> 43:26.041
Yeah.

43:29.291 --> 43:31.250
I'm gonna have to sell
my art collection.

43:34.458 --> 43:35.667
Slow down.
Oh...

43:35.750 --> 43:39.750
The pledge--
it's not legally binding.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.458
Legally binding?

43:41.542 --> 43:43.959
This is Ezra Goldman.

43:44.041 --> 43:48.583
Just what kind of man
do you think he is, huh?

43:48.667 --> 43:50.000
I can handle Ezra.

43:50.083 --> 43:52.542
Oh, sweetheart,
I love you, but...

43:52.625 --> 43:54.583
I don't think so.

44:13.917 --> 44:14.166
(sighs)

44:14.250 --> 44:15.208
Wha...

44:15.291 --> 44:17.959
(stammers)

44:19.458 --> 44:21.500
You want me to stick around
for dinner?

44:21.583 --> 44:24.250
No.

44:24.333 --> 44:26.542
I'm more than good, baby.

44:26.625 --> 44:29.208
Just... go home.

44:29.291 --> 44:30.250
Good night, June.

44:30.333 --> 44:32.375
Good night.

44:35.959 --> 44:37.208
Play nice, Chico.

44:37.291 --> 44:38.250
Carlos.

44:38.333 --> 44:39.875
Whatever.

44:46.417 --> 44:48.500
(dialing)

44:50.500 --> 44:52.500
Yeah, I can't believe
how fucking easy this was.

44:52.583 --> 44:53.542
What?

44:53.625 --> 44:54.291
Cochran.

44:54.375 --> 44:56.166
He's at the Airport Inn at LAX.

44:56.250 --> 44:57.333
What's he doing there?

44:57.417 --> 45:01.375
Well, wearing
a tight white T-shirt

45:01.458 --> 45:02.917
and a leather vest.

45:03.000 --> 45:03.959
What color?

45:04.041 --> 45:05.375
Black.

45:05.458 --> 45:06.917
Rock and roll or S&M?

45:07.000 --> 45:08.250
Uh, a little of both.

45:08.333 --> 45:09.917
Wait, with, uh...

45:10.000 --> 45:12.208
tight ripped jeans
and a bandana.

45:12.291 --> 45:13.625
He's got a young girlfriend.

45:13.709 --> 45:14.875
No, no, no, no, no.

45:14.959 --> 45:15.959
It's kinkier than that.

45:16.041 --> 45:17.750
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
Boyfriend?

45:17.834 --> 45:19.208
He's getting something
out of the trunk.
What?

45:21.834 --> 45:23.583
Fuck, forget it.

45:23.667 --> 45:23.917
What? What is it?

45:26.375 --> 45:28.750
He's in a fucking cover band.

45:29.959 --> 45:31.834
(laughs)

45:31.917 --> 45:33.041
(phone beeps)

45:37.125 --> 45:38.959
(dialing)

45:40.250 --> 45:42.166
(sighs)

45:42.250 --> 45:44.125
(phone ringing)

45:46.750 --> 45:47.792
Hello?

45:47.875 --> 45:49.959
I want you to meet me someplace.

45:50.041 --> 45:51.166
Are you kidding me?

45:51.250 --> 45:53.291
Come on.

45:55.583 --> 45:57.458
You'll be glad you did.

45:59.375 --> 46:00.834
I don't know
what's what anymore.

46:00.917 --> 46:02.709
Come meet me.

46:02.792 --> 46:04.792
I'm texting you the address now.

46:17.917 --> 46:21.500
(door opens, closes)

46:31.458 --> 46:33.625
We're closed.

46:33.709 --> 46:34.917
They must have
forgot to lock it.

46:38.041 --> 46:39.917
(clears throat)

46:46.166 --> 46:47.500
Can I help you?

46:47.583 --> 46:49.375
You Mickey Donovan?

46:49.458 --> 46:50.417
Who wants to know?

46:50.500 --> 46:52.625
I'm Ronald Keith.

46:54.875 --> 46:58.041
I'm your new
parole officer.

46:58.125 --> 46:58.542
Oh.

46:58.625 --> 47:00.500
I got Lupita.

47:00.583 --> 47:01.417
You made a mistake.

47:01.500 --> 47:04.375
No, it's no mistake.

47:05.458 --> 47:07.750
You've been reassigned.

47:09.583 --> 47:10.917
Nah.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.458
You cannot stay here.

47:13.542 --> 47:14.709
This is a boxing gym.
People gamble here.

47:14.792 --> 47:16.542
That's bullshit.
It's a new regulation.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.583
Pack your shit. Let's go.

47:17.667 --> 47:20.083
My son owns this place.

47:20.166 --> 47:24.166
You come with me...
or I'll violate your ass

47:24.250 --> 47:27.959
so fucking quick, you won't know
what fucking hit you.

47:28.041 --> 47:30.000
Where am I supposed to go?

48:20.875 --> 48:22.000
(phone ringing)

48:25.125 --> 48:26.500
Yeah?

48:26.583 --> 48:28.458
EZRA: What the fuck
did you do, Raymond?

48:28.542 --> 48:29.959
Calm down, Ezra.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.458
I just talked to June.

48:31.542 --> 48:34.125
I gave you a job to do,
you didn't do it.

48:34.208 --> 48:34.750
She can't afford it.

48:34.834 --> 48:37.542
Not acceptable, Raymond.

48:37.625 --> 48:39.041
Not acceptable.

48:39.125 --> 48:41.959
What do you want me to do, Ezra?
Beat her up?

48:44.875 --> 48:45.542
MICKEY:
Leroy comes home from school,

48:45.625 --> 48:47.917
says to his mama,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.667
"Mama, why do I have the biggest
dick in the third grade?

48:50.750 --> 48:51.834
Is it 'cause I'm black?"

48:51.917 --> 48:54.375
She says, "Who told you
that, Leroy? That's racist.

48:54.458 --> 48:57.041
"You don't have the biggest
dick 'cause you're black.

48:57.125 --> 49:00.500
You have the biggest
dick 'cause you're 23."

49:00.583 --> 49:01.875
(chuckles)

49:01.959 --> 49:03.041
Yeah.

49:07.250 --> 49:09.166
(sirens wailing in distance)

49:17.583 --> 49:17.709
What's this?

49:18.417 --> 49:21.166
Your job.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.166
Be there at 5:00 a.m.

49:45.041 --> 49:49.041
