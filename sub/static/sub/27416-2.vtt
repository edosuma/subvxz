00:01.200 --> 00:03.400
You think the London Fields boys
could come to Summerhouse

00:03.401 --> 00:05.319
if he was doing his job right?

00:05.320 --> 00:05.880
What do you want from me?

00:05.881 --> 00:07.439
Let me run Summerhouse.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.440
Do you have a history of mental
illness, Lisa?

00:09.441 --> 00:13.559
Mum, mum.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.280
Is someone looking after Ra'Nell?

00:15.281 --> 00:17.519
Are you pregnant or just fat?

00:17.520 --> 00:18.318
Shut up, man.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.840
How long's it take to grow a crop?

00:19.841 --> 00:22.719
13 weeks, I give you good price.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.399
They put her in a mental hospital.
If they found out, I'd go in care.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.760
We've got this place in Finchley,
it's set up.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.400
You know we're fucked now.

01:16.640 --> 01:23.599
That's 40 bags' worth of my grub
that you've lost.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.399
I promise ya, let me get your
money back.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.479
Well, I know I'll get my money, but
what you two should've said is when?

01:30.480 --> 01:33.319
You got three days.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.719
Three days?

01:34.720 --> 01:37.999
There's no way we're going to get
your money in three days, Bobby.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.919
Really?

01:39.920 --> 01:42.959
I must've been off my fuckin'
canister doing business with you.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.679
I told ya. You told me what?

01:44.680 --> 01:47.799
We said we're going to get his
money, we'll get his fucking money.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.839
Calm down, listen.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.959
Bobby we're going
to get your money, yeah?

01:51.960 --> 01:53.679
All we need is some guns.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.760
Guns?

01:56.320 --> 01:57.879
Guns?

01:57.880 --> 01:59.599
Don't make me laugh.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.440
That's twice Kamale's robbed us now,
both times he was carrying.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.679
I ain't no hothead, you know that.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.519
I'm saying, we're going to need some
more time, going to need some guns.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.880
You got two weeks, that's it.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.598
Now fuck off, the pair of ya.

02:19.599 --> 02:21.000
Go on, fuck off.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.639
They're going to think you've
gone soft.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.559
Yeah?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.360
Well that would be a big
mistake, Lee.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.759
Ya know what I'm thinking?

02:38.760 --> 02:41.639
We got a snake, bruv, That's twice,
that ain't no coincidence.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.720
What you saying?

02:47.721 --> 02:50.160
I don't know, man,
something ain't right.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.560
Put your seat belt on.

03:06.560 --> 03:12.919
Everything's all right but you're
going to have to take it easy.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.999
Rest?
I don't do rest, it's not me.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.880
Heather, I'm being serious,
that was a close call.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.119
If you want to keep this baby,
you've got to look after yourself.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.960
Is there anyone who can
help you out?

03:50.800 --> 03:52.440
Come on, Marnie, good girl.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.200
Good girl, come on.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.640
You'll need this to keep her warm.

04:09.641 --> 04:12.641
Marnie, look what Ra'nell got you.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.439
You all right?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.679
I did a bit of extra cleaning for my
nan and I wanted to give you this.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.119
What?

04:38.120 --> 04:41.279
You've been on your own all this
time, I'm only trying to help.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.358
I don't need your money.

04:42.359 --> 04:43.838
How many times do I tell you,

04:43.839 --> 04:45.840
when someone offers you money,
you take it?!

04:47.840 --> 04:48.958
Ra'Nell!

04:48.959 --> 04:50.240
Ra'Nell!

04:50.241 --> 04:52.040
Shit, there's that milf.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.960
Aren't you coming to class?

05:04.160 --> 05:06.839
I wouldn't do this,
babes, believe me.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.719
But I've got no other choice.
I need to ask you a favour.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.799
OK.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.000
Come with me, yeah?

05:17.320 --> 05:21.879
Fucking hell!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.799
You've got a sick farm.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.039
You ain't meant to know about farms.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.319
I'm nearly 14.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.440
That's what I mean.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.799
I wouldn't ask you to do
this, Ra'Nell,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.560
but I've been told to take it easy.

05:34.561 --> 05:38.039
Or else I could have another
miscarriage.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.959
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
talk about shit like that to you.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.360
You haven't got to do much.
It's all pretty straightforward

05:44.361 --> 05:46.080
and I'll pay ya.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.320
But I need to know
I can depend on you.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.359
OK.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.639
You have to be very, very careful.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.839
You can't tell no-one,

05:56.840 --> 06:00.000
and I mean no-one. Not your best
mate, not your girlfriend...

06:00.680 --> 06:03.400
No-one, and especially not your mum.

06:04.880 --> 06:05.960
I won't say anything.

06:05.961 --> 06:07.959
I could go to prison for this.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.320
Do you understand?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.439
Right.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.360
Let me show you what to do.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.360
This is long.

06:22.361 --> 06:26.199
Kamale is going to be
hiding in his yard right now.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.720
He ain't going to be out
on the road.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.719
Fucking 40 grand, y'know?

06:29.720 --> 06:32.639
He's got to be fucking somewhere.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.999
Well, we're gonna find him.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.200
Right now, I'm fucking hungry
though.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.400
Man.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.398
You Chris Hill?

06:49.399 --> 06:50.680
That's right. You are?

06:50.681 --> 06:52.639
Get the...

06:52.640 --> 06:54.279
My god!

06:56.760 --> 06:57.720
Leave her alone!

06:57.721 --> 07:00.080
Get off me, get off of me!

07:04.000 --> 07:07.279
Your brother Dushane owes me
40 grand. Little cunt.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.559
OK, I'll pay it,
I'll make sure he pays.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.239
Listen. Next time you see him,
you show him your chest.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.399
No, please, God... No!

07:20.800 --> 07:22.078
Bro, we got two weeks,

07:22.079 --> 07:24.400
we have to work out how we're
gonna get to Kamale.

07:24.401 --> 07:28.039
He's a smart bruvva.
Bruv, he's smart.

07:28.040 --> 07:32.039
Bruv, he's on the 20th floor,
he's at the top of the block.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.759
You know the lift ain't working
in that bitch, yeah?

07:34.760 --> 07:37.279
Man's got to climb all them
fucking stairs,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.638
get into the flat,
then deal with them

07:39.639 --> 07:41.480
and then get all the way back
down again...

07:42.880 --> 07:45.559
without getting seen.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.840
I can't see that happening, bruv.
That's on top.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.759
You know what? We should've just
killed him when we had the chance.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.080
What you saying,
what, you're ready to kill, yeah?

08:14.480 --> 08:18.520
Thanks for coming. You don't
understand what a relief this is.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.160
How's your mum?

08:22.161 --> 08:24.160
She's in hospital.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.280
What?

08:26.281 --> 08:29.159
What do you mean she's in hospital?

08:29.160 --> 08:30.478
Why didn't you tell me?

08:30.479 --> 08:32.400
What's wrong with her,
what's happened?

08:32.400 --> 08:35.719
Ra'nell, what's happened to your
mum? Can you talk to me?

08:35.720 --> 08:38.839
Chill out, she's gonna be all right.
It's all gonna be cool.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.080
She's just a bit tired.
Leon said she'll be home soon.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.799
Who you staying with?

08:47.800 --> 08:49.999
Who's looking after you, Ra'Nell?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.159
Well, look...

08:52.160 --> 08:53.760
do you wanna come and stay at mine?

08:53.761 --> 08:56.960
Nah, Leon brings me food
so it's all right.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.800
Promise me.

09:04.801 --> 09:06.519
Yeah, I promise.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.880
All right.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.800
You fucking bastard.

09:18.801 --> 09:20.159
Nat? What you doing?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.240
You fucking bastard!

09:21.241 --> 09:23.159
What? What are you doing?!

09:23.160 --> 09:24.600
Chris is in hospital because of you!

09:24.601 --> 09:26.719
Why, what's wrong with him?

09:26.720 --> 09:28.479
Because you owe someone money,

09:28.480 --> 09:30.999
they came into my house,
they put an iron on his chest!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.599
Who? Who the fuck are you talking
about?! Natalie!

09:33.600 --> 09:34.760
What hospital is he in?

09:34.761 --> 09:37.199
No! You stay the fuck away from us!

09:37.200 --> 09:38.840
We don't want you in our lives
anymore.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.520
Fuck this.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.240
Oi, Dushane!

10:06.440 --> 10:08.519
Where you been? I sent you a text.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.999
I was busy, innit.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.679
Yeah, what was you busy at?

10:11.680 --> 10:14.559
You ain't got the right to ask me
that. You ain't my old man.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.079
As long as you wasn't hanging
with them boys on the road.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.519
I wasn't with them.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.839
Good. So where you been?

10:21.840 --> 10:23.799
With a girl.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.080
A girl?

10:29.640 --> 10:30.719
Precious.

10:30.720 --> 10:31.800
Precious?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.639
Go inside and smarten yourself up.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.320
I got a surprise for you.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.238
Oi!

11:07.920 --> 11:10.919
Fucking pussy! Fucking pussy!

11:10.920 --> 11:13.519
Ai, ai, move, move, move,
move, move!

11:13.520 --> 11:15.720
You fucking pussy!

11:17.080 --> 11:23.359
Don't ever come after my family
again, you understand?!

11:23.360 --> 11:25.039
Pussy hole!

11:25.040 --> 11:27.279
Fucking mugs.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.159
Come on then. Cunts.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.200
Come on.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.039
You're late.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.879
Sorry. I got caught up.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.400
You've got two minutes, Leon,
otherwise I'm fucked.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.600
Lisa?

12:02.520 --> 12:04.840
Lise? Got a visitor.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.520
Let me see you.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.960
You all right, Mum?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.400
I'm going to get better...

12:29.440 --> 12:30.760
I promise.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.520
I won't ever leave you again.

12:33.521 --> 12:35.480
Don't worry about it, Mum.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.600
I promise.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.520
I'm doing all right at school.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.960
That's good.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.119
I'm sorry you have
to see me like this.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.719
It's all right, Mum,
don't worry about it.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.760
I'm sorry, baby.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.600
Come on, we gotta go.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.959
This is yours.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.839
That ain't ours, bruv.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.720
It is.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.039
Weirdo!

15:24.040 --> 15:25.880
Open it up.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.600
Shit.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.440
Must be Raikes', innit?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.079
Yeah, but how we going to do that?
That's the ting.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.240
We're going to lure him out, bruv.

15:47.241 --> 15:49.399
Lure him out. That's smart.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.758
Oi, but yo,
that kid with the dog as well.

15:51.759 --> 15:54.078
He's fuckin' gotta get it
as well, you know.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.238
Nah, man, we don't even know
he's the snake yet.

15:55.239 --> 15:56.558
Come on, man.

15:56.559 --> 15:57.438
What?

15:57.439 --> 15:59.200
Bruv, who else could it be, then?

15:59.201 --> 16:02.359
No-one. Tell Dris and them
to keep an eye on him.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.879
Don't do nothin' yet.
..Bruv, what are you doing?

16:05.641 --> 16:09.039
Move from me.
Don't come near me with that orange.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.919
Stealing oranges
from the market, yeah?

16:11.920 --> 16:14.718
Old habits, you know,
you know how it is.

16:14.719 --> 16:16.080
What are you looking at, man?

16:16.081 --> 16:19.239
Here, here take that bag?
Quickly. Take it, man!

16:19.240 --> 16:21.880
Yo. Yo, Wendell.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.360
Dushane!

16:27.640 --> 16:28.600
That your son?

16:28.601 --> 16:30.839
Yeah, this is Jason.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.200
How old?
Five.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.919
Jason got any brothers or sisters?

16:35.920 --> 16:39.280
One of each. Twins.
They're three now.

16:40.840 --> 16:46.239
What you sayin', little man?
You all right?

16:46.240 --> 16:48.279
You livin' round here now?

16:48.280 --> 16:53.079
No, his mum's mum lives round
the corner. You're looking good.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.279
Yeah, you too.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.600
Yeah, you know.
Gettin' older.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.878
I gotta go pick up
the twins from school.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.559
Good to see you.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.877
Yeah, you too.

17:09.878 --> 17:11.718
Yo, Jason...

17:11.719 --> 17:13.040
Take care, yeah?

17:13.040 --> 17:15.039
Say goodbye, Jason. Say goodbye.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.199
You don't have to be shy
with me, you know.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.079
I'm your brother.
I'm Dushane.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.520
See ya later.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.000
Who's the older, fam?

17:29.001 --> 17:31.439
No-one. Come, man!

17:31.440 --> 17:33.279
Go on, go and steal some meat!

17:35.240 --> 17:37.040
I might do.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.240
Come.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.640
How's that feel?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.520
It's all right.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.040
You ever see Wayne?

18:16.041 --> 18:18.879
I don't have much to do
with Wayne no more, you know.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.360
You must see him around?

18:20.361 --> 18:22.600
I see him around
from time to time, but...

18:26.040 --> 18:27.560
How was he?

18:28.560 --> 18:30.040
Wayne's Wayne.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.919
Lisa, look, right now...

18:34.920 --> 18:37.559
I didn't need to ask that, did I?

18:37.560 --> 18:41.559
If there's one thing Wayne
couldn't do without is a woman.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.600
She's welcome to him.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.360
Does he ever ask about me?

18:58.240 --> 19:00.359
Does he ask about his son?

19:00.360 --> 19:02.640
Wayne ain't going
to change, Lise.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.279
I can let you have that
for three and a half, yeah.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.039
All right, George.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.959
What day for?

19:24.960 --> 19:28.239
On the 26th?
I can do that, all right.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.160
Yeah, all right.
Bye-bye. Thank you. Ta-ra.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.080
Bobby.

19:34.081 --> 19:35.239
Yeah, go on.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.518
Cor, fuck, look at the state
of you! What's happened?

19:37.519 --> 19:38.960
They fucking jumped me!

19:38.961 --> 19:39.839
Who?!

19:39.840 --> 19:43.839
Who do you think? Dushane and Sully!
There's gotta be comeback, Bobby.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.640
They can't disrespect me. If they
disrespect me, they disrespect you!

19:46.641 --> 19:49.599
Yeah, of course, mate. But...

19:49.600 --> 19:51.480
People saw what fuckin' happened
in the club! They fuckin' saw it!

19:51.481 --> 19:54.479
Yeah, but Lee...
Here's my problem, mate.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.079
Them two little fuckers
owe me a lotta money.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.959
Now, anything happens to them
and I don't get my money,

19:59.960 --> 20:01.519
then I'm outta pocket.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.839
Fuck that! It's fucking political,
mate! They can't do what they did

20:04.840 --> 20:06.200
and expect nothing to come
fucking back at them!

20:06.201 --> 20:08.559
Well, then, go and kill 'em, Lee.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.519
But if you do that,
then you have to take on the debt.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.559
Fuck!

20:14.560 --> 20:18.120
Right, Lee, listen.
I tell you what we do.

20:19.200 --> 20:27.119
If they don't meet that deadline,
then be my guest. You can kill 'em.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.920
Then the debt
becomes yours, my friend.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.679
Here's that little snake, bruv.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.040
I need to keep an eye
on that yout, swear down.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.919
Wagwan, Gem.
What you sayin', cuz?

20:50.920 --> 20:51.720
You all right.

20:51.721 --> 20:53.319
Gem, watcha doin'?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.279
Nothin'. Just buyin' paint.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.718
What you buyin' paint for, man?

20:56.719 --> 20:58.400
Painting Ra'nell mum's room, innit.

20:58.401 --> 20:59.719
Yeah?

20:59.720 --> 21:00.318
What colour?

21:00.319 --> 21:01.800
It's like yellow-ish.

21:01.801 --> 21:03.959
It's Loyal Wheat, man.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.999
I like yellow, innit.
I got that in my room.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.439
Hey, Gem, you coming?

21:12.440 --> 21:14.360
So what, does your dog
do any tricks?

21:14.361 --> 21:17.359
Yeah. Marnie!

21:17.360 --> 21:20.799
Sit. Sit! Sit!

21:20.800 --> 21:24.799
Come on, girl. Beg. Beg! Beg!

21:24.800 --> 21:26.679
Usually does it. Marnie, sit!

21:26.680 --> 21:29.799
That dog's dead, bruv.

21:32.280 --> 21:36.159
Balance. Balance. Balance.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.720
That's hard still!

21:39.200 --> 21:40.919
Good girl!

21:40.920 --> 21:42.040
Good girl.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.639
The dog's sick, bruv.

21:43.640 --> 21:47.839
I'm A Big Man

22:05.960 --> 22:10.359
Oi, Ra'nell. Is there anyone
troublin' you or disrespectin' you?

22:10.360 --> 22:14.959
If anyone tries it with you, see
Gem. I'll fuck them up good for you.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.719
Cos they respect me, bruv.
Why d'ya think?

22:22.720 --> 22:23.840
Does Chantelle respect you?

22:23.841 --> 22:27.039
I think so,
she loves Marnie as well.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.639
I seen the way you look at her man,
I know you like her.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.159
Shut up, man!

22:31.160 --> 22:32.360
Are you going to take pics?

22:32.361 --> 22:35.600
No, no, I'm not going to take pics.

22:38.080 --> 22:41.639
When I think it's ready. I don't
need you telling me what to do.

22:41.640 --> 22:46.199
Hey, I'm starting to get bored
already, man. This is so shit.

22:46.200 --> 22:50.039
This is going to take long, man,
I should've stolen a roller instead.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.640
Can you remember what you were like
when you first came in?

23:31.240 --> 23:33.839
You were extremely withdrawn,
very down.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.360
Well, that's common
with psychotic depression.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.439
But you've come a long way.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.679
You're interacting much more
with the other patients now.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.279
And you've started using the gym,
I see, with Leon?

23:45.280 --> 23:49.040
Leon, yeah. Leon's been
very nice to me.

23:50.720 --> 23:54.359
There's a light at the end
of the tunnel, Lisa.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.360
We're going to help you find it.

23:58.840 --> 24:02.480
How would you feel about going out
for a day? Would you like that?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.599
I think so.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.518
Yes, doctor.

24:09.519 --> 24:09.998
Get your clothes.

24:09.999 --> 24:10.640
Get ready, blood.

24:10.641 --> 24:12.159
Are we going?

24:12.160 --> 24:12.960
Come on, let's go, innit.

24:12.961 --> 24:15.039
Just come, come on.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.719
Where's your clothes?

24:16.720 --> 24:19.279
Where we going? Where we going?

24:19.280 --> 24:19.878
Just put your clothes on.

24:19.879 --> 24:21.320
Get the fuck out of here.

24:21.321 --> 24:23.519
I'm not going
to put my clothes on.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.638
Where's my keys?

24:24.639 --> 24:26.560
What's the hurry?

24:26.561 --> 24:30.240
You've been asking questions
all the time, man.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.518
You got nice feet.

24:34.519 --> 24:36.160
Thanks.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.959
See you later.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.040
Come on. Come on.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.679
Yo?

24:52.680 --> 24:54.599
Yo, I might've seen Kamale.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.040
Where?

24:55.041 --> 24:58.519
The bowling alley. Ninja and
Tyler and some Field Goons.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.400
All right, bruv, go to the back,
yeah, I'm going to meet you there.

25:00.401 --> 25:02.519
'All right, cool, cool.'

25:02.520 --> 25:07.439
Bruv, Tareek just saw Ninja and them
mandem in the bowling alley, fam.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.039
I don't even know.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.440
Ring Dris and tell him to pick up
the pieces from the little ones.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.159
Yo. Keep that low,
cos it's bait out here.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.039
Bere cameras, innit.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.639
All right, just look out
for me, fam.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.840
What you saying?

25:27.841 --> 25:31.199
I've seen someone that looks like
Kamale, but I'm not sure if it's him.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.679
Then there's no point in goin' in
there unless we know for sure, bruv.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.120
You know Ninja and them, man,
they always carry.

25:36.121 --> 25:38.800
I hear that, but this could be
our last chance, yeah.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.320
You know what Kamale looks like?

25:47.321 --> 25:49.240
Yeah.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.679
- Yeah, that's good.
- That was all right.

25:58.960 --> 26:03.159
Sea of Love

26:09.760 --> 26:12.320
Can you see if
Kamale's with 'em?

26:14.720 --> 26:17.559
I can't see and
I don't want to look.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.999
So just chill out.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.719
I didn't know they had guns.
Did you know they had guns?

26:23.720 --> 26:25.799
No.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.320
You stay here.
I'm going to go to the ladies.

26:44.720 --> 26:45.999
Ain't him.

26:46.000 --> 26:46.760
Fuck!

26:46.761 --> 26:48.880
That's a shame, bruv.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.600
Fuckin' come down
for no reason. Shit!

27:03.720 --> 27:06.399
I am not bringing up my kid
round here, no way.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.719
It's not that bad.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.359
Yeah, that's cos we're used to it.
There are places, believe it or not,

27:11.360 --> 27:13.440
where you can let your kids
out at night,

27:13.441 --> 27:16.639
and not worry about them being
stabbed or picked on by police,

27:16.640 --> 27:18.640
That's one of them places
I want to live.

27:18.641 --> 27:22.199
Where?

27:22.200 --> 27:27.359
It's a new development, really
quiet, beautiful. It's just perfect.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.719
Well, all depends on the crop,
don't it? How much I get.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.559
If you don't get enough from this,
grow another one. You'd be rich.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.319
I have thought about that,
but it's like gambling, innit?

27:37.320 --> 27:40.800
You say you're going to do one more,
then stop, but you don't.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.999
People get greedy
and that's how they get caught.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.159
So don't tell... or I'm dead.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.320
Good.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.278
Yo, look who it is.

28:11.279 --> 28:12.278
Who is it?

28:12.279 --> 28:13.758
That's Shaun.

28:13.759 --> 28:14.438
Who's Shaun?

28:14.439 --> 28:16.560
Kamale's cousin.
Year below us in school.

28:16.561 --> 28:20.639
Yeah, but he ain't even on the road,
he don't run with Kamale and them.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.320
Yeah, but he's family, blood.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.160
You get what I'm sayin'?

28:37.800 --> 28:38.800
All set?

28:38.801 --> 28:40.279
Yeah.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.680
You need to be back in the hospital
by 9pm.

28:42.681 --> 28:45.359
Don't be late.
It's very important, OK?

28:45.360 --> 28:46.999
I won't.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.560
Have a great day.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.679
Dushane, listen, we're running out
of time, bro.

29:07.680 --> 29:11.599
If we don't get this money, trust me,
we're fucking dead meat.

29:11.600 --> 29:16.439
If we mark Shaun like they mark
Chris, I'm telling you.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.039
Sends out a message.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.880
We or one of your family
will keep on

29:19.881 --> 29:21.759
till we get our fucking food back.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.200
Sure they're on the road?

29:23.201 --> 29:24.839
Chris weren't on the road.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.599
That didn't stop them.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.119
Trust me, bro, it's better they
ain't on the road.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.040
That way, it sends a bigger message.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.680
You know what?

29:38.440 --> 29:41.799
Kamale wants his cousin back,
he has to bring the food, innit?

29:41.800 --> 29:43.479
Simple.

29:43.480 --> 29:46.320
That could work.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.519
Hi.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.959
Thank you.

30:00.960 --> 30:01.880
Thanks.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.040
Can I get that?

30:14.640 --> 30:16.079
Do I owe you money?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.879
No, that's all right, darling.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.320
You don't owe me nothing.

30:21.680 --> 30:22.919
Thank you.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.040
I'll put all this in there for you.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.199
There.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.119
OK, thank you.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.559
Stay bliss.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.439
Hey, bruv. Jules told me
that you're a virgin.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.318
Is that true?

30:37.319 --> 30:38.720
Yeah, so what?

30:38.721 --> 30:39.959
You serious?

30:39.960 --> 30:41.240
Yeah.

30:41.241 --> 30:43.799
Bruv, what is up with that?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.960
I'm holding it for that
special girl.

30:45.961 --> 30:47.559
Bruv, you sound gay.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.119
I'm not gay. I've got girls.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.118
You've got girls?

30:50.119 --> 30:51.200
Yeah, I got plenty of girls.

30:51.201 --> 30:53.999
So, what do you do with these girls
if you're a virgin then?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.318
I get sucked, blatant.

30:55.319 --> 30:56.078
Is it?!

30:56.079 --> 30:56.598
Yeah.

30:56.599 --> 30:57.960
What else do you do then?

30:57.961 --> 30:59.719
I get a smelly finger.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.519
That it?

31:01.520 --> 31:02.320
Yeah.

31:02.321 --> 31:04.359
Sure you ain't pushing
nothing in there?

31:04.360 --> 31:07.719
Like your tongue?

31:07.720 --> 31:09.160
You're a bocat man, sharp.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.040
Any girl would tell you the
tongue's a good tool.

31:13.041 --> 31:15.199
Bollocks.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.759
Hey, Gem!

31:16.760 --> 31:18.399
I bet Snake's a bocat.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.159
Gem ain't no snake.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.839
Ain't what Jules says.

31:22.840 --> 31:23.720
Yeah, I'm good.

31:23.721 --> 31:25.079
Where are you going?

31:25.080 --> 31:26.440
To our den.

31:26.441 --> 31:27.599
What's that?

31:27.600 --> 31:29.480
Where me and Marnie go
and hang out.

31:29.481 --> 31:31.799
Why don't you come and check it out?

31:31.800 --> 31:33.799
Yeah. Oi, you coming?

31:33.800 --> 31:35.280
No, I'm cool. I'm going home.

31:35.281 --> 31:36.639
You sure? Yeah.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.880
All right, cool.

31:37.881 --> 31:39.439
Come on.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.079
This guy's a bocat, you know.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.280
Shut up!

34:10.000 --> 34:10.558
William?

34:10.559 --> 34:11.598
The pump.

34:11.599 --> 34:13.719
It's stopped working,
I can't get it started.

34:13.721 --> 34:14.958
Shit.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.998
I'll be there as soon as I can,
all right?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.958
You've got to keep the plants
watered. Do it by hand.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.199
I'll do it now.

34:22.201 --> 34:25.759
Listen, I've really got to go.
I'm sorry, I've got an emergency.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.239
I'm sorry.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.640
Well done, Ra'Nell.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.879
This place is sick, man.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.599
How did you find it?

35:58.600 --> 36:03.479
Me and Ra'Nell found it when we were
It's been our hang about since.

36:03.480 --> 36:07.199
And you've got a little bed
for Marnie!

36:07.200 --> 36:08.879
That's proper cute.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.160
We sometimes sleep here
in the summer.

36:13.520 --> 36:17.120
Don't you get scared?

36:18.520 --> 36:20.559
Don't your parents ask where you are?

36:20.560 --> 36:23.479
No. It's just me and my dad.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.920
He's always at the chippy,
so he don't really realise.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.320
She went away.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.719
Where?

36:32.720 --> 36:34.319
You for real?

36:34.320 --> 36:36.079
You don't know where your mum is?

36:36.080 --> 36:37.280
No.

36:41.680 --> 36:45.839
Feels like Dushane and Sully
are like my family, innit?

36:45.840 --> 36:48.840
So... That's the only people
I've kind of got.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.519
What, ain't you never been drunk
before?

36:55.520 --> 36:57.799
No.

36:57.800 --> 36:58.240
Yeah.

36:58.241 --> 36:59.240
God, man.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.519
What perfume are you wearing?

37:07.520 --> 37:08.599
What?

37:08.600 --> 37:11.279
What perfume are you wearing?
You smell nice.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.319
Thank you.

37:12.320 --> 37:13.520
Natural smell?

37:13.521 --> 37:14.400
Yeah.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.838
Do you have a girlfriend?

37:17.839 --> 37:19.000
No.

37:19.001 --> 37:20.559
You ain't got no girlfriend?

37:20.560 --> 37:22.399
What, are you gay or something?

37:22.400 --> 37:23.959
No, just...

37:23.960 --> 37:26.960
None of the girls in my school
are as pretty as you.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.919
Don't make me blush.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.719
You are nice though.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.479
You're really nice.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.520
Thank you.

37:35.521 --> 37:39.039
Boys are not usually nice to me.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.640
It's cold.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.320
Hey, Mum, you gonna make me some
of that pepper sauce?

37:52.321 --> 37:54.719
Pepper sauce takes too long to make.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.599
Mum, what you being like that for?
What's wrong with you?

37:57.600 --> 37:59.599
Come on, you know I need my sauce.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.919
Or else I can't eat nothing, I'm
going to start losing my appetite

38:02.920 --> 38:06.479
and then I'll lose weight,
I'll be all skinny and that.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.719
All right,
I'll make you pepper sauce,

38:08.720 --> 38:10.678
but you have to do something for me.

38:10.679 --> 38:12.000
Well, of course.

38:12.001 --> 38:14.159
Come to church with me on Sunday.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.038
Man. Mum, I'm going, I'm going.

38:16.039 --> 38:17.760
Especially if you want pepper sauce!

38:17.761 --> 38:19.519
Stop, stop!

38:19.520 --> 38:21.600
I'll see you later, yeah?
I love you.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.680
I dunno, I'll check it later.

38:52.520 --> 38:56.800
Ra'Nell. They let me out
for the day, I'm at the flat.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.160
Well done, babes.
I think we're gonna be OK.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.880
Thank God.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.280
Ra'Nell, what's the matter?

40:32.640 --> 40:34.240
Mum!

42:47.360 --> 42:50.720
Excuse me, blood,
do you mind helping me for a second?

42:55.640 --> 42:57.880
Why you hit him so hard, man?

43:03.840 --> 43:06.079
This brother's heavy.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.080
Careful, careful.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.079
Boy, I wish we
could see Kamale's face

43:16.080 --> 43:18.280
when we tell him
we got Shaun, you know?

43:31.080 --> 43:33.679
Right, get out the fucking car.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.680
Something ain't right.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.800
Fuckin' dead, bruv,
you killed him, blood!

43:39.801 --> 43:42.080
I can't believe this shit, you know!

43:43.400 --> 43:44.599
Fuck!

43:44.600 --> 43:46.880
Man, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

43:46.881 --> 43:49.279
What, you think I meant that, bro?

43:49.280 --> 43:50.678
For fuck's sake, man!

43:50.679 --> 43:51.958
Shit!

43:51.959 --> 43:52.840
I didn't mean this shit!

43:52.841 --> 43:58.479
Well, he's fuckin' dead now, innit?!

43:58.480 --> 44:00.359
What are we gonna do?

44:00.360 --> 44:02.160
God. Jeez...

44:08.600 --> 44:11.440
Come on.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.360
It's Lisa.

44:42.880 --> 44:45.799
Hiya, Lisa ...
did you have a good day?

44:45.800 --> 44:48.159
Yeah, it was nice... thanks.

44:48.160 --> 44:49.118
Yeah?

44:49.119 --> 44:49.998
Thank you.

44:49.999 --> 44:51.240
That's good.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.960
'As long as only me and you know
what went down, then we're cool.'

46:31.760 --> 46:33.799
'I think you're ready.'

46:33.800 --> 46:36.000
Shaun was Kamale's cousin, innit?
He ain't gonna disrespect his family.

46:36.001 --> 46:37.599
Kamale's got to show up.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.160
'I don't think I've got enough for
that deposit.'

46:39.161 --> 46:42.519
She sell to someone else.
I know the olders on the estate.

46:42.520 --> 46:43.798
Haven't told anyone, have you?

46:43.799 --> 46:44.718
No.

46:44.719 --> 46:45.998
There's that other thing, the snake.

46:45.999 --> 46:47.360
We ain't got time for that.

46:47.361 --> 46:49.039
He doesn't even know Kamale!

46:49.040 --> 46:50.880
Get off him!

46:52.480 --> 46:53.439
Yo...

46:53.440 --> 46:55.520
'Dushane ... it's Kamale... '

47:24.800 --> 47:27.880
