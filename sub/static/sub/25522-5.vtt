01:55.657 --> 01:57.700
Hurt me if you can,
but my wounds will heal

01:57.785 --> 02:00.286
stronger than before,
and my scars will armor me.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.914
I will never give up my husband!

02:02.998 --> 02:05.291
I will never betray my town!

02:20.641 --> 02:21.682
Alan?

02:30.818 --> 02:34.111
Look at you. Perfection.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.866
-Can you...
-Yeah.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.998
Today celebrates
what is unmovable about this place.

02:46.792 --> 02:47.959
About us.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.211
I just want things to be nice.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.587
And it will be.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.048
It's gonna be
the best Calhoun Day ever.

02:57.469 --> 03:01.889
Now, which jacket do you like?

03:03.016 --> 03:07.311
People are talking, Cubby.
This story is blowing up.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.855
Do not say "blowing up."

03:08.939 --> 03:10.773
We are both too old for "blowing up."

03:10.858 --> 03:13.067
Well, it's got more hits
than our site's ever got.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.777
What do the kids call that?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.028
Look, we need to feed this thing.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.614
Can you turn me around
a new installment in 24 to 48?

03:19.324 --> 03:20.449
48, maybe.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.076
We need more about those girls.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.244
Who were their best friends?

03:23.620 --> 03:25.121
What's the pattern here?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.123
What the hell's wrong with this town?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.333
Well, that I cannot fit
into 800 words.

03:29.418 --> 03:33.129
Big picture. Rotting America.
Fall of Rome stuff.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.798
Yeah, it's more like
the fall of the South.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.384
My backyard's about
to be littered with Confederate flags.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.805
Now, that's good. You gotta
milk the shit out of that cow.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.349
Yeah, I'm not sure
those two metaphors go together.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.767
You been drinking?

03:47.352 --> 03:48.436
Funny girl.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.439
Hey, kid, I'm proud of you.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.732
Yeah,
I'll get on it. Thanks.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.275
You're doing...

04:13.086 --> 04:14.879
If it's the floor
your readers want,

04:14.963 --> 04:16.881
the light flatters it best
from the doorway.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.051
You a shutterbug, Mrs. Crellin?

04:20.135 --> 04:21.928
I just... I know this floor,

04:22.012 --> 04:24.805
and this house has been
a part of my family for ages.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.850
There's soldiers' blood on this floor.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.604
My mother was a Calhoun.
She married into the Preakers.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.607
They had the money,
the Calhouns had the house.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.902
That's never gonna make it
into the magazine. Anyway...

04:38.403 --> 04:40.738
No, it's just...

04:41.782 --> 04:43.616
I am just the photographer.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.743
Good background.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.872
This was added in the '30s.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.208
And do you see

04:52.834 --> 04:55.002
where the ivory ends here?

04:55.963 --> 04:59.799
Lean times for the...
For the Calhouns.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.803
And of course,
you can't get ivory anymore.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.222
Camille!

05:06.890 --> 05:08.516
No, no, that's... That's all right.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.684
And youe shoes.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.268
How many times...

05:11.645 --> 05:13.437
Camille!

05:15.065 --> 05:17.024
It's fine,
it's fine. See?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.068
Thank you.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.552
Hey. Call me back
when you have a minute.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.138
I want to talk to you
about this article I just read.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.098
Beautiful.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.017
Right on Calhoun Day.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.493
Here you go.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.621
K.C.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.167
Well, it's tradition.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.044
Wear it every year.
I gotta look my best.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.881
Yeah, I still think
your tradition's a bad idea.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.299
Be right with you, Detective.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.633
Take your time.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.635
Can't call it off now. Besides,

06:26.720 --> 06:29.096
-people need to blow off steam.
-That's what I'm afraid of.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.682
Well, you should
have thought of that before.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.478
"Wind Gap victims knew killer.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.272
"Police scrutinize community.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.566
"Sources close
to the investigation... "

06:40.650 --> 06:42.651
-I like that word, "close."
-I didn't tell her anything

06:42.736 --> 06:44.612
she hadn't figured out already.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.322
And I got something out of it, too.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.074
Ooh, I hope you did, son.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.243
Now everybody's all het up,
going on about Keene and Nash.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.953
I never mentioned them.
She never mentioned them.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.955
I don't know how many folks
sent me this article

06:55.040 --> 06:56.082
in the space of two hours.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.374
And you still think it's a good idea

06:57.459 --> 06:58.501
to get these het-up people

06:58.585 --> 06:59.710
convened in one place?

06:59.795 --> 07:00.878
You ask me,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.630
if you cancel
you're asking for trouble.

07:03.006 --> 07:06.509
There's a lot of folks ready to drink,
and no place to be? No, thank you.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.635
There you go.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.139
I doubled the detail.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.476
I got good men and true
coming in from up county.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.394
I'm not worried about Calhoun Day.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.771
Thank you, Clyde.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.275
A little worried
about you, though, son.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.113
Your Preaker girl?
Good tree, bad apple.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.409
Hey. There's things
about her you don't know.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.245
You watch yourself.

07:36.915 --> 07:37.957
And Kansas City,

07:40.210 --> 07:43.379
if you're coming,
don't dress like a Union soldier.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.257
-Thank you, Clyde!
-Chief.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.678
Anything with fleurs-de-lis
is gonna be dining room service.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.763
Without is veranda.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.306
Mama,
will you run lines with me?

07:54.391 --> 07:55.641
In a minute, sweet.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.145
And of course, anything past
the tents is plastic ware.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.481
It's a big job.
Thank you. These look beautiful.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.775
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.280
-Okay...
-I want Camille to do it.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.159
Camille never liked
our pageant history.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.368
Did you?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.370
No, I just thought
it was an odd thing to celebrate.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.999
-But I don't mind.
-I'm Millie Calhoun.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.001
You're the Yankee rapist.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.506
All right. "You're gonna tell us
where he's hiding,

08:27.591 --> 08:28.632
"girl, or else."

08:28.717 --> 08:30.050
I will never give up my husband.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.719
I will never betray my town!

08:31.803 --> 08:34.138
You'll have to burn this tree down.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.807
I forgot how creepy this play was.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.602
Tried to change it,
but Mr. Lacey wouldn't go for it.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.937
Just let it be. It is what it is.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.231
You said it's that way
only because it's written by men.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.026
Wow, you did, now? Wow.
So you're a feminist?

08:47.110 --> 08:50.446
That is not what
you're wearing to the party, is it?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.407
It's a barbecue,
and I'm wearing jeans.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.742
It's not a barbecue.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.912
And you're in all black.
On Calhoun Day?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.872
Well, I'm not really a part of it.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.791
Folks don't understand that, Camille.
You're under my roof.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.169
Field trip to find you
something appropriate.

09:05.754 --> 09:10.341
Let's go!
Just girls. Hear that, Alan?

09:10.592 --> 09:11.634
Yes, dear.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.179
She's so easy to rile.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.265
My other phone. Don't tell Mama.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.685
You have Ann and Natalie in there?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.521
You guys were friends, right?

09:24.606 --> 09:26.565
You used to hang out with them?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.317
Not that much.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.778
I mean, like, a million years ago.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.571
- Seventh grade.
- Alan?

09:32.656 --> 09:34.949
- Coming.
- That was, like, a year ago.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.245
Do you feel like
you can talk to me about them?

09:39.704 --> 09:41.747
-On the record?
-Come on.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.123
Kidding.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.416
I just...

09:46.836 --> 09:48.254
I don't like to think about them.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.005
It scares me.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.466
I feel bad,

09:53.385 --> 09:55.886
because we weren't friends
anymore when it happened.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.181
They still wanted to,
like, play in the woods,

09:59.307 --> 10:00.683
build forts and shit.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.060
Kid stuff.

10:05.981 --> 10:09.191
You guys used to hang out
in that hunting shed?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.359
Shit.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.152
"'Wind Gap protects its own'

10:14.155 --> 10:16.198
"You hear that a lot
in a small Missouri town.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.242
"But two grisly child murders
have changed

10:18.326 --> 10:19.868
-"the meaning of 'protect."'
-Don't read that.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.287
Don't read that.
Where did you get that?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.163
Kelsey. Jodes shared it to her.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.165
"Sources close to the investigation

10:25.250 --> 10:27.167
"confirm that the local community... "

10:27.502 --> 10:30.170
John, right?
"Is under scrutiny."

10:30.255 --> 10:32.006
Can you keep it down, please?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.633
Holy shit. Three more people
just shared it to me.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.261
Shared it "with" you. And put it away.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.054
Fucking Jodes saw this before I did?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.973
Girls! Let's go.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.141
Bitch.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.668
she still has that ugly grate.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.421
Such a shame
people in town feel the need

11:12.505 --> 11:14.131
for that sort of thing.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.175
Good morning!

11:16.259 --> 11:19.053
We have some great things
set aside for you ladies today.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.305
And who is this lovely creature?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.848
This is my eldest daughter.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.808
-Camille. It's a pleasure.
-Hello.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.185
She takes after her father.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.020
His coloring, his temperament.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.897
How are your hands? I heard.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.691
Roses are so cruel
to my soft skin.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.342
That's more than I ever
heard you say about my father.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.636
There's not much else to say.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.016
Mama, help me pick.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.310
I've got this one. Or these.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.312
Give me a minute, sweet.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.940
I must concentrate on
this five-alarm fire here.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.109
- Come in the dressing room.
- Amma, give me a minute.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.527
No.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.491
Camille wrote a new article.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.743
-Everyone's talking about it.
-What's that?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.703
She said it's either John Keene

12:26.788 --> 12:28.831
or Bob Nash who killed those girls.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.167
No, I just said that authorities
think it might be a local.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.919
"...Mexicans or drifters
or truckers."

12:34.003 --> 12:36.588
-Amma.
-Says it in the article, plain as day.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.757
-"Wind Gap kills its children."
-Stop!

12:38.883 --> 12:40.676
Right now!

12:43.763 --> 12:45.305
You've made me bleed.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.890
Both of you.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.559
I'm not sure
of your taste, Camille,

12:48.643 --> 12:50.519
but I think you'd look
lovely in these.

12:50.645 --> 12:53.647
Sarabeth,
you do have an eye.

12:54.232 --> 12:57.151
Why don't you take Camille
to the dressing room

12:57.235 --> 13:00.195
while I pick out something for Amma?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.697
Right this way, darling.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.490
Amma.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.661
And you let me know
if I can get you anything else.

13:07.745 --> 13:08.787
You know what?

13:08.872 --> 13:11.373
-I think I would like to try this one.
-Okay.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.418
- Mama? This one?
- There you go.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.647
Can I please have the one
that I picked out, please?

13:40.195 --> 13:41.653
Excuse me, Sarabeth?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.655
You all right in there?

13:46.451 --> 13:47.618
Where are my clothes?

13:47.702 --> 13:49.369
Which one fits better?

13:49.454 --> 13:51.246
Well, none of these are gonna work.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.832
- Just try one!
- What's wrong?

13:54.042 --> 13:55.584
Your sister's being stubborn.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.336
Can you have her go wait in the car?

13:58.004 --> 14:00.005
-Why?
-I have no idea why.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.673
Amma,
just go wait in the car.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.468
Can you have her go wait in the car?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.595
Amma, can you just wait in the car?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.847
Camille, just let me see you.
I have got to get home,

14:08.932 --> 14:10.224
for heaven's sake!

14:16.689 --> 14:17.731
You happy?

14:19.651 --> 14:20.901
Go wait in the car.

14:31.871 --> 14:32.913
Go.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.918
That's what you wanted, right?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.380
It's worse than I remember.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.840
You weren't there at the end.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.679
So it's over?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.101
Yes.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.312
Hardly matters. You're ruined.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.274
All out of spite. You want to know

15:00.358 --> 15:03.318
who your father was?
That's who he was.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.613
All spite. I'm glad Amma saw.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.366
I'm sorry.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.911
I started it
with the article. I didn't...

15:56.456 --> 15:57.623
I didn't think she'd...

15:58.875 --> 16:01.501
I didn't know about your...

16:05.381 --> 16:07.466
I'm sorry. I was mad.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.350
Did it hurt?

16:18.186 --> 16:20.937
'Cause I know a girl like you.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.814
Not like you, but...

16:22.899 --> 16:27.402
She says it doesn't hurt
because the cut's already there

16:27.654 --> 16:28.904
under the skin.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.156
The knife just lets it out.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.576
Your friend sounds like
an after-school special.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.370
What's that?

16:42.085 --> 16:44.711
-Do you have my name on there?
-I don't do names.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.464
-Not even boyfriends?
-I don't do boyfriends.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.428
Come on,
I want to show you something.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.765
Please.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.184
Chief,
we've gotta respond to a 288.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.770
- Copy that. I'm here.
- Be safe out there.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.233
Come on, you don't want
to miss your turn.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.493
Wait for me!

17:44.814 --> 17:46.022
Please stay.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.902
I don't know if I can.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.782
If I can, you can.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.549
Well, lookit here.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.510
Veranda girls,
35 Calhoun Days running.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.805
-Got to be a record.
-It's classic Adora.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.807
"On this special day,

18:20.892 --> 18:22.642
"everyone is welcome in my home.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.395
"P.S. Don't come in my home."

18:25.480 --> 18:26.980
That's so true.

18:36.073 --> 18:39.075
Hello, Avery!

18:40.286 --> 18:43.079
Thank you for coming to my party.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.206
I love you.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.707
You okay?

18:48.044 --> 18:51.087
And there is
our most beautiful hostess.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.923
Ladies, enjoy.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.509
Girls.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.762
It's good to see you.
Jackie, you finding everything?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.722
Everything found me.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.183
Well, enjoy,
and please save some liquor

19:03.267 --> 19:05.268
for the rest of us.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.688
- I enjoyed Camille's article.
- I haven't read it.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.899
You should
really take a look at it.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.277
You should.
It's honest, it's refreshing,

19:14.362 --> 19:15.946
-it's timely.
-As are you.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.490
Cheers, ladies.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.825
Okay.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.576
Hello, boys.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.704
I think that I should probably
just head home, okay?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.623
What are you talking about?

19:26.791 --> 19:28.166
Just give it a few more days.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.336
Cubby, you holding up?

19:31.963 --> 19:33.004
Um...

19:33.673 --> 19:35.882
Well, I guess that's not
for you to worry about, is it?

19:37.468 --> 19:39.302
Look, I thought that
sending you home would help,

19:39.387 --> 19:40.804
but I forget sometimes

19:40.888 --> 19:43.598
how parents aren't always
good for their kids.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.729
-Camille?
-Yeah.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.443
It's just that whenever I'm here,
I just...

19:57.864 --> 19:59.072
I just...

19:59.407 --> 20:01.575
I feel like a bad person.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.247
Camille.

20:08.958 --> 20:13.295
Camille, you are
one of the most decent people I know,

20:13.379 --> 20:15.839
and there aren't that
many decent people left in the world.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.883
With my folks gone,
it's pretty much down

20:17.967 --> 20:19.551
to you and Eileen.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.846
- No, I'm not decent.
- Camille, you are.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.055
No, I'm not.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.683
Even to the most worthless
pieces of shit.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.977
Hey, why do you think
I keep you around?

20:29.061 --> 20:31.187
It's not because
you're a great reporter.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.567
Kiddo, was that funny?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.152
I meant it to be funny.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.070
You know I'm funnier when I drink.

20:39.155 --> 20:40.697
I'm not allowed to drink.
So here's the deal.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.450
Go get a drink. Make it a double.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.622
Camille.

20:49.624 --> 20:50.916
You want to come home, kiddo?

20:53.836 --> 20:54.920
No.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.088
I should see this through.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.301
That's my Cubby.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.638
You know we're here for you.

21:05.723 --> 21:06.765
Thanks.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.726
-We'll talk soon.
-Okay.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.145
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:18.319 --> 21:19.486
Fuck it.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.913
Fuck, no.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.334
-Kansas City.
-Chief.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.169
I'd like you to meet my wife, Jocelyn.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.129
Ma'am. Pleasure to meet you.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.131
Detective Willis.
I've heard so much about you.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.759
Well, I hope I can change
your opinion of me.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.136
Charming, as advertised.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.847
Don't flatter yourself, Betty Sue.
Come on, honey.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.517
-Have a great day, Detective.
-Happy Calhoun Day.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.228
- Hey.
- Yeah.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.076
Camille Preaker!

22:08.911 --> 22:11.454
Why don't you come over here,
hang out with us for a little bit?

22:11.539 --> 22:13.832
That does sound delightful,
but I can't right now.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.333
Maybe later.

22:18.379 --> 22:22.507
My, my. Those Crellin girls
sure do like their boys with badges.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.022
What's up, James?

22:40.276 --> 22:41.568
Hey, Big City.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.069
Hey, Bob.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.280
What the hell you doing here?

22:45.573 --> 22:47.115
It's Calhoun Day.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.409
I'm just enjoying the festivities.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.744
-Really?
-Yeah.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.079
You sure you're not following me?

22:53.456 --> 22:54.664
You're the one that came up to me.

22:54.749 --> 22:57.000
-Hey.
-Do yourself a favor

22:57.084 --> 22:58.626
and don't touch me again.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.753
You got it?

23:03.424 --> 23:04.632
Is this a joke to you?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.053
I lost a kid, remember?

23:16.395 --> 23:18.772
It's no joke, Bob. Okay?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.108
Look, I'm telling ya,
we're gonna get this guy.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.443
There'll be justice.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.696
What, are you gonna...

23:27.865 --> 23:30.784
You gonna strangle him
and rip out his teeth?

23:32.620 --> 23:34.079
That'd be justice, wouldn't it?

23:34.413 --> 23:35.955
All I'm asking you to do
is lock him up.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.665
Jesus, he's right over there.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.753
You cut my stuff? All of it?

23:41.837 --> 23:45.340
I gave you good stuff.
I gave you John. We had a deal.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.759
-There was no deal, Ashley.
-I am John's only advocate...

23:47.843 --> 23:49.302
-Let's just go.
-No. We are not leaving.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.306
You don't want to burn this bridge.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.141
I know things, Camille.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.685
Come on.

24:03.651 --> 24:04.984
-Let's keep it that way.
-Yep.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.663
-Hey. There she is.
-Hi, guys.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.748
Read your article, Big City.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.458
Where'd you learn to write like that?

24:20.543 --> 24:21.709
Couldn't have been here.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.129
Where'd you learn to read like that?
Couldn't have been here.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.381
Hey, we're starting a pool.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.174
Nash or Keene.
Who you got your money on, Preaker?

24:28.259 --> 24:30.635
-It was the brother, right?
-I'm gonna get myself a beer.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.012
-Now, don't go.
-Say, Camille.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.390
Why don't we take
a little tour around the grounds

24:35.474 --> 24:36.975
and get reacquainted?

24:37.309 --> 24:39.227
I bet your wife
would just love that?

24:39.436 --> 24:41.229
She won't mind.
One of us has gotta get some.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.981
These gentlemen
bothering you, Miss Preaker?

24:43.065 --> 24:44.315
-No.
-Excuse me?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.733
No, no. Come on.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.486
You ain't in Kansas anymore, Toto.
All right?

24:48.863 --> 24:50.947
Let's just enjoy
the festivities.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.825
Son of a bitch.
Can't-get-laid motherfucker.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.034
-Yeah.
-It ain't me.

24:55.119 --> 24:58.037
No, no, no, it ain't me

24:58.706 --> 24:59.873
You feeling all manly now?

24:59.957 --> 25:01.541
No, no,
just a little frustrated,

25:01.625 --> 25:03.168
'cause the girl
I'm seeing won't call me back.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.460
We're seeing each other?

25:04.545 --> 25:05.920
We are now.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.380
Plus, she wrote
this inconvenient article

25:07.464 --> 25:08.506
about my case.

25:08.591 --> 25:10.508
Published it on
the worst day possible.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.635
Well, she has a talent for that.

25:15.055 --> 25:16.097
Can I help you?

25:16.182 --> 25:18.558
Yeah, I'll take two beers
and a glass of wine.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.143
Here you go.
Can you carry all that?

25:20.227 --> 25:21.352
I got it.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.229
Adora.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.399
Welcome. Hello.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.734
Thank you for having us.

25:28.444 --> 25:31.362
-The town needed it, don't you think?
-Yes.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.450
How's the case coming, Chief?

25:35.910 --> 25:38.203
It appears my daughter
has some notions.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.787
Do you share them?

25:40.206 --> 25:42.415
Well, I'm afraid...

25:42.583 --> 25:44.626
I'm not at liberty
to comment, Mrs. Crellin.

25:44.710 --> 25:49.047
Yes, well... Enjoy the barbecue.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.924
Thank you.

25:51.008 --> 25:53.092
You look beautiful, as always.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.510
Thank you so much.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.269
Jodes.
Lovely, beautiful girl.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.939
So, what is this thing, anyway?
Calhoun Day.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.857
So what, it's Confederate pride?

26:08.525 --> 26:10.276
We don't use the "C-word" here
in Missouri.

26:10.361 --> 26:13.821
Right. Bite my tongue.
Silent racism is best.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.699
So, Zeke Calhoun,
our founding pedophile,

26:16.784 --> 26:18.326
he fought for the South,

26:18.577 --> 26:20.995
and his child-bride, Millie Calhoun,

26:21.080 --> 26:25.083
she was my great-great-great
grand-victim or something.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.834
She was from a Union family.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.044
Hell of a pairing.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.880
Yeah, well, one day,
the Union soldiers

26:30.965 --> 26:33.424
come down here
to collect hubby, dead or alive.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.969
But brave Millie, who is with child,

26:36.053 --> 26:38.513
she refuses to give Zeke up,
she resists.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.975
But it's how she resists
that people in this town just love.

26:42.393 --> 26:45.019
The Union soldiers,
they tied her to a tree,

26:45.688 --> 26:47.230
did horrible things to her.

26:47.481 --> 26:48.898
Violations.

26:49.858 --> 26:52.485
But Millie never said a word.
Lost the baby.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.362
The end. Applause.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.030
And this is a holiday?

26:56.448 --> 26:58.491
We don't have a lot
of happy stories around here.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.743
Yeah. I got that on our first date.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.829
That was a date?

27:02.913 --> 27:04.622
I don't know. I'm just fishing here.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.762
Don't beat anyone up.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.479
Camille! How are you, sweetie?

27:28.564 --> 27:29.731
I'm good, thank you.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.941
I was just looking for Amma.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.109
We need to calm her down.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.986
She's a little nervous. Stage fright.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.322
There isn't enough beer
at this party to calm her down.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.865
I mean, you didn't hear this from me,

27:38.949 --> 27:41.159
-but she's a bit of a wild...
-Gretchen.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.619
Whose lawn are you standing on, honey?

27:44.204 --> 27:46.414
Well, thank you
for not telling me, Gretchen.

27:49.752 --> 27:51.502
Look who's putting on airs now.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.338
I hate her dress.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.840
Kansas City, here I come.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.053
No, no, no, it ain't me

28:01.930 --> 28:05.433
Confederate and Union
soldiers drinking together.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.480
Detective.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.859
-Mrs. Crellin.
-It's so good of you to come.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.986
Thank you
for your hospitality. This...

28:17.738 --> 28:20.698
-This place is amazing.
-Would you like a tour?

28:20.783 --> 28:23.409
I could have a plate sent up
to the house if you like.

28:23.494 --> 28:25.453
I don't want you
to go to any trouble. That's okay.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.705
Well, it's no trouble at all.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.749
My home is your home.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.034
Amma.

29:06.662 --> 29:07.703
Mama.

29:10.249 --> 29:13.209
This is Nathan.
He just wanted to see the dollhouse.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.669
- Ma'am.
- Hello.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.797
Your sister's waiting to rehearse
with you backstage.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.048
She is?

29:19.133 --> 29:20.925
Yes. You better get down there.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.224
My daughters might be a lot of things,

29:28.308 --> 29:30.351
but they really do care
for one another.

29:33.647 --> 29:36.482
This wallpaper is hand-painted

29:37.067 --> 29:40.653
on silk from Paris.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.905
Inside invite. That's a first.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.075
Hey. Have you seen Amma?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.204
I think she went back to the house.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.165
Okay. Thanks.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.460
Camille.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.756
I'm glad you're back.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.383
That makes one of us.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.228
I always knew
you'd get out of here.

30:15.689 --> 30:16.856
Thanks.

30:17.441 --> 30:20.568
I've thought a lot about you.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.403
Camille Preaker.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.615
Good luck with the play.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.911
Guess who's inside with your mama.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.498
Mama said you wanted
to rehearse with me.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.083
I did. I just got something
that I need to do.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.171
I'll run lines with you, sweetheart.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.506
I'm fine, thanks.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.137
This ivory floor,

30:49.139 --> 30:52.141
all ivory, was a wedding present

30:53.143 --> 30:55.895
for my great-great-grandmother.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.107
Before anybody knew
what "endangered" was.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.862
It was supposed to last forever.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.241
And it has, just.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.703
Things fall apart awful quick.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.541
Good things, good people, gone,
just like that.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.045
Richard, some people
don't understand loss,

31:21.129 --> 31:23.339
because some people haven't lost.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.674
But the people here...

31:24.758 --> 31:28.636
And I know all this
must seem strange to you,

31:28.720 --> 31:32.473
these country folk,
our backward ways...

31:32.558 --> 31:34.183
No, ma'am, I never said that.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.935
I don't want
to tell you your business.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.605
It's your job to see the bad in us.

31:39.773 --> 31:41.607
That's not my job, Mrs. Crellin.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.317
I just want to remind you,

31:43.402 --> 31:44.902
there's good here, too.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.114
No matter what you might have heard.

31:49.491 --> 31:52.743
Would you mind
taking your shoes off, please?

31:53.829 --> 31:55.371
-Sure.
-Thank you.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.136
You've spent time
with my daughter lately.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.681
We're both after the same thing.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.642
And what might that be?

32:18.061 --> 32:20.563
Ten minutes
to showtime, everyone.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.398
Ten minutes to showtime.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.191
Camille? Camille.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.694
You know the detective, Willis,
from Kansas City?

32:26.778 --> 32:29.363
-Yeah, I've talked to him.
-Which way is he leaning?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.324
To the left, if you ask me.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.867
Stop it!

32:32.951 --> 32:35.369
You know what I mean.
We think it's Nash.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.163
They don't really tell me much.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.123
Well, your piece
said it was John or Bob Nash...

32:39.207 --> 32:41.375
No, I didn't say that
it was John or Bob Nash.

32:41.460 --> 32:45.129
Someone should tell that to Bob.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.797
Wouldn't it be nice
if he did it?

32:46.882 --> 32:48.341
You're such a class act,
Gretchen.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.343
Then it wouldn't have
to be sweetie John.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.219
Windfall for the inmates.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.013
You must think we're awful.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.018
She lost a sister, you know?

32:59.895 --> 33:01.437
I do. I'm sorry.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.607
Camille's strength went with her.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.859
People avoid the topic.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.446
But I can speak of it.

33:11.573 --> 33:15.201
Camille can't.

33:17.162 --> 33:21.540
Even now, she's recovering
from a recent episode.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.335
She's delicate.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.963
A rare rose.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.259
But not without thorns.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.056
You should come
to our Pity Party tomorrow night.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.016
It's a tradition,
we sit around, we watch Beaches,

33:39.101 --> 33:40.601
and we cry and we cry.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.436
- It's fun.
- I don't think that I can.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.689
You'll get a month's worth of articles
in the first 10 minutes.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.233
Plus, it'll be a giggle.
It'll be like old times.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.902
-Please, Camille?
-Okay, sure. Why not? Right?

33:49.986 --> 33:51.195
Yay.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.571
Wear something kicky.

33:52.656 --> 33:53.823
Okay.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.460
- Quite a place.
- Yeah, it is.

34:06.962 --> 34:10.047
I'm starting to get
a picture of your upbringing.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.717
What did she say?

34:13.260 --> 34:15.344
Did I do something wrong?
Is your mother off-limits?

34:15.429 --> 34:17.430
Is that part of the tradition?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.058
No. I'm sorry.

34:21.435 --> 34:22.768
No.

34:23.353 --> 34:26.814
The only Calhoun Day tradition
you really need to respect is

34:26.898 --> 34:29.233
drinking enough
to get through Calhoun Day.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.287
All right, boys and girls.

34:41.747 --> 34:42.872
Showtime.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.426
There you go.

35:11.151 --> 35:14.028
I just can't believe that
she didn't use any of my stuff.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.530
That bitch.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.919
Why must men always fight?

36:13.255 --> 36:14.588
I know you're afraid.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.757
Evil is about to descend on Wind Gap.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.844
What must we do, my brave husband?

36:20.428 --> 36:22.137
At the first sign of trouble,
you must flee.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.056
So what did she say, really?

36:25.976 --> 36:28.811
A lot. I know a lot.

36:31.064 --> 36:33.607
About that floor
made of elephant tusks.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.527
Kinda fucked-up standing on it,

36:36.903 --> 36:38.988
for a guy that wanted to
be an animal doctor.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.489
That's all she talked about?

36:42.659 --> 36:44.535
Was there something else
she should have said?

36:46.663 --> 36:49.373
That you could take advantage
of me maybe, when I'm drunk?

36:55.338 --> 36:57.548
Zeke, you cannot go
and fight those Yankees.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.300
Who will defend our children?

37:08.810 --> 37:10.352
The Yankees are coming!

37:14.065 --> 37:15.608
I will distract them.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.735
Once I do, you'll get help.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.381
You are a Union woman.

37:39.466 --> 37:40.925
You've honored your bond.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.636
You best tell us
where he's hiding, girl...

37:45.805 --> 37:47.514
- Or else.
- Or else.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.768
Do with me what you will.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.189
Hurt me if you can,

37:55.273 --> 37:57.900
but my wounds will heal
stronger than before!

37:57.984 --> 37:59.902
My scars will armor me.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.321
I will never give up my husband!

38:02.405 --> 38:04.448
I will never betray my town!

38:04.532 --> 38:06.867
You'll have to burn this tree down!

39:39.377 --> 39:40.919
You son of a...

39:43.131 --> 39:44.339
Somebody get him off!

39:55.393 --> 39:58.395
-Amma!
-Get him off!

39:58.480 --> 39:59.646
Amma!

40:02.817 --> 40:04.735
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

40:06.237 --> 40:07.279
Woo!

40:07.363 --> 40:09.782
-All right! All right!
-Fucking killed my daughter!

40:09.866 --> 40:12.701
-God damn!
-Look out! Look out!

40:13.078 --> 40:15.204
-Fucking pervert!
-Bob, shut the fuck up!

40:16.122 --> 40:17.414
Go on. Go on.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.792
Did I get you there, John?

40:20.502 --> 40:21.919
Woo!

40:22.003 --> 40:23.504
Take that, you candy-ass.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.756
Baby killer!

40:25.840 --> 40:29.843
I think the situation
has been resolved, so...

40:29.928 --> 40:32.513
Why don't we give
another round of applause

40:32.597 --> 40:35.808
to our fine,
young Wind Gap performers here?

40:37.727 --> 40:41.688
And for Mr. Kirk Lacey,
who set all of this up!

40:44.526 --> 40:44.691
-Come on, have some water.
-No.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.485
-Come on, have some water.
-No.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.530
-Please?
-She left without her phone.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.366
She never leaves
without her phone.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.202
Well, she might have
her other one. Right?

40:55.370 --> 40:56.912
What other one?

40:57.914 --> 41:02.626
Three hundred people
and no one saw a thing.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.837
Adora, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna check the woods.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.005
We got some men together, all right?

41:07.090 --> 41:10.175
-I mean, my God! My God!
-Sweetheart, please.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.178
Amma!

41:14.389 --> 41:16.306
Amma!

41:17.058 --> 41:18.350
Come on, boys.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.979
Amma!

41:24.607 --> 41:26.024
Amma!

41:26.734 --> 41:27.818
Amma?

41:31.406 --> 41:33.991
Amma! Amma!

41:42.125 --> 41:43.876
Amma! Amma!

41:57.807 --> 42:00.851
Amma? Hey.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.394
Amma, are you okay?

42:02.478 --> 42:03.645
Amma, what the hell?

42:09.152 --> 42:10.485
I've got her!

42:29.172 --> 42:32.674
She's shaken up, scratched.
Poor thing.

42:33.509 --> 42:37.095
So, what? She claims she ran away
'cause she was upset about the play?

42:37.180 --> 42:39.306
She's not really up to talking.

42:39.766 --> 42:43.268
The important thing is
she's all right.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.229
Yeah.

42:47.523 --> 42:51.235
Would you have a drink
with me on the veranda?

42:57.659 --> 42:58.992
Please?

43:01.704 --> 43:03.872
I wanted to apologize.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.625
No, Mama... Mama, you don't have to.

43:07.961 --> 43:09.294
I just... I wasn't thinking,

43:09.420 --> 43:11.296
and I should have
told my editor to wait

43:12.048 --> 43:14.216
on the article, so...

43:17.804 --> 43:19.972
Mama, can I talk to you about Amma?

43:21.140 --> 43:22.641
She's scared of something.

43:23.142 --> 43:26.228
I think that's the reason
she's doing what she's doing.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.690
What's she doing?

43:32.527 --> 43:35.070
Her mood swings. Her acting out.

43:35.238 --> 43:37.948
That's just being a teenager.

43:40.660 --> 43:44.621
Well, I'm sure you'll do
what you think is best.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.456
I try.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.126
And I...

43:51.921 --> 43:55.966
I appreciate you not telling
that detective about, um...

43:57.885 --> 44:01.722
But, darling,
he'll find out, won't he?

44:01.806 --> 44:03.390
I mean, not to be blunt, but...

44:05.268 --> 44:07.185
When you get close...

44:07.270 --> 44:08.395
I won't

44:09.897 --> 44:13.942
get close. I don't. I never get close.

44:14.694 --> 44:17.362
But that's what I wanted
to apologize for.

44:21.034 --> 44:22.701
You can't get close.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.120
That's your father.

44:28.374 --> 44:30.417
And it's why I think...

44:35.089 --> 44:36.673
I never loved you.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.677
You were born to it,

44:42.180 --> 44:44.681
that cold nature.

44:46.517 --> 44:49.019
I hope that's some comfort to you.

45:20.718 --> 45:21.927
Let me see you.

45:32.688 --> 45:33.939
It's okay.

46:05.221 --> 46:06.805
Do you like that?

46:21.779 --> 46:22.904
No.

46:25.783 --> 46:26.992
No.

46:28.369 --> 46:29.661
No.

46:31.497 --> 46:32.706
My way.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.499
We do it my way.

46:35.251 --> 46:36.376
My way.
