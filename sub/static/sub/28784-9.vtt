WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:03.200
Is it worth it?

00:03.230 --> 00:04.700
Is what worth it?

00:04.730 --> 00:07.000
Moving to Bakersfield.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.140
Anyone he's willing
to leave Denver for

00:09.170 --> 00:11.010
-has got to be amazing.
-Thank you.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.040
To whom it may concern.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.010
"You are in ownership of
property

00:15.040 --> 00:16.980
"along the official route
of California's new

00:17.010 --> 00:18.150
high-speed rail system."

00:18.180 --> 00:20.050
MRS. BASKETS:
Seizing the rodeo?!

00:20.080 --> 00:21.320
I think we should fight this.

00:21.350 --> 00:22.820
Let's fight it.
I love that.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.650
-MRS. BASKETS: I'm in.
-CHIP: I'm in.
-DALE: I'm in.

00:24.690 --> 00:28.360
-DALE: City hall,
here come the Baskets!
-(horn honking)

00:32.900 --> 00:33.860
MRS. BASKETS:
802...

00:33.900 --> 00:37.670
803... 801?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.840
Now it's going down.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.740
Oh, I'm so confused.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.910
It's a classic
big government tactic.

00:43.940 --> 00:45.910
Confuse the proletariat.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.540
CHIP:
Hey, Mom and Dale, I found it.
It's down here.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.680
Oh, here it is.

00:50.710 --> 00:53.350
Oh... oh, finally, a human.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.850
Oh, that's me.

00:54.880 --> 00:58.590
-I'm here to see
Assemblyman Brian Von Vogel.
-Yes.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.720
Oh, well, he's not in
his office now.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.030
But if you look here

01:03.060 --> 01:05.390
-on his website...
-Uh-huh.

01:05.430 --> 01:07.060
-Just press that button.
-Oh.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.060
Well, we want to see him
in person.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.230
We're here to take some names

01:10.270 --> 01:12.370
and, uh, bust some skulls,
right?

01:12.400 --> 01:14.700
Well, not right now.
We just want to speak to him.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.870
Oh. Oh, okay.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.770
Let me try to find him for you.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.210
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.710
"Contact Brian Vogel."

01:22.750 --> 01:27.220
Dear Brian. B-R-A-I-N.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.750
CHIP:
Ma'am, it's kind of urgent
that we talk to him.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.220
We own one of the properties

01:30.250 --> 01:31.550
that the government wants
to destroy

01:31.590 --> 01:32.890
so it can build
the bullet train.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.760
We're trying to save
our family rodeo.

01:35.790 --> 01:37.890
Oh, neat.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.960
You know, they're having
a hearing in Sacramento

01:41.000 --> 01:42.730
-on the 15th.
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.600
You should go protest there.

01:45.630 --> 01:47.270
That's tomorrow.

01:47.300 --> 01:51.270
Oh, I know. This year has
just flown by. (chuckles)

01:51.310 --> 01:52.980
You know what?

01:53.010 --> 01:54.810
We should go.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.580
-Sacramento?
-Mm-hmm.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.110
Oh, it's so beautiful there
this time of year.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.080
Let's go to this.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.590
We have to.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.190
Oh, that's wonderful.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.930
Hey, Facebook Live,
this is Dale.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.000
Welcome to the proletariat rise.

02:13.030 --> 02:15.260
Um, I'll show you a few things.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.000
I got a bunch of flags here--
American flags--

02:17.030 --> 02:18.770
to make some protest suits
out of.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.800
Check out my shirt.
"Kiss My Caboose."

02:21.840 --> 02:26.610
Oh, I want to show you the...
the exterior...

02:26.640 --> 02:28.610
of my house.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.280
(horn honks)

02:31.310 --> 02:34.520
DALE:
What the hell are you
wearing a suit for, Chip?

02:34.550 --> 02:36.850
Well, I thought we should
look professional.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.150
Are you filming me?

02:38.190 --> 02:39.490
Yeah, there's cameras
everywhere.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.990
You better get used to it,
old man.

02:42.020 --> 02:44.690
Turn that off, please.
That's terrible music.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.460
DALE:
Don't touch that.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.160
-Now, say hello to my followers.
-(sighs)

02:49.200 --> 02:51.800
DALE:
Hey, Mom, what's in
the Tupperware?

02:51.830 --> 02:53.800
It's a Cindy Evans pie.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.800
It's for the government
officials.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.470
-Everybody's got a sweet tooth.
-DALE: Beautiful pie, Mom.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.970
-Will you take it?
-Sure.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.340
-Were you gonna get out?
-I'll get out.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.980
-Good.
-I'll let you sit in here, Mom.

03:02.010 --> 03:05.150
Oh, I love-- Hey, honey,
you know what I'm thinking?

03:05.180 --> 03:06.980
-What?
-I better pee one more time
before we go.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.020
DALE:
Oh, God.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.990
Oh, it's so nice to have
all the family together.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.660
You know, fighting
for our legacy.

03:15.690 --> 03:17.830
-Yeah.
-I do have a question, though.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.700
-Who's gonna speak
at the hearing?
-DALE: You know what?

03:19.730 --> 03:22.500
I nominate myself. I think
I have the best speaking skulls.

03:22.530 --> 03:23.670
Skills.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.900
But, you know, I'm the CEO.
I don't know.

03:24.930 --> 03:26.240
Should I-- should I do it?

03:26.270 --> 03:27.870
DALE:
If you do it,
you'll just get up there

03:27.900 --> 03:30.070
(laughing): and drool all over
the microphone. Right, Mom?

03:30.110 --> 03:32.910
No. I'll tell you what.
I think I should do it.

03:32.940 --> 03:36.350
'Cause I am the face of all the
commercials for the rodeo,

03:36.380 --> 03:37.850
and I own it.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.580
Plus, I've got a great
opening line, you guys.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.190
Yeah? What is it?

03:43.220 --> 03:45.420
"The bullet train has
come off the rails."

03:45.450 --> 03:46.860
I can't beat that.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.020
That's really good, Mom.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.430
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.700
Also add, though, that in 2006,

03:52.730 --> 03:55.900
the-the budget for the
bullet train was 35 billion.

03:55.930 --> 03:59.230
And now it's skyrocketed
to 98 billion.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.600
Is that right?

04:00.640 --> 04:02.370
Yep. Yep.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.370
Oh, my God.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.740
Good for you, Chip.
Listen to you.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.380
I've never thought of you
like this.

04:07.410 --> 04:10.380
-Like what?
-Well, you're so smart.

04:10.410 --> 04:13.050
I mean, I've always thought you
were smart, don't get me wrong.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.050
No, he's never been that smart.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.220
-But that sounded smart.
-No, I-I mean,

04:16.250 --> 04:18.950
but you're really
applying yourself here.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.260
Well, I just, you know,
I'm just trying to

04:20.290 --> 04:22.790
-act like a CEO.
-Very nice.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.890
Very nice.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.230
220 miles to go!

04:26.260 --> 04:28.400
Ah, that's a lifetime.

04:28.430 --> 04:31.730
* 99 bottles of beer
on the wall *

04:31.770 --> 04:33.140

and pass it around *

04:43.680 --> 04:45.910
* You take one down,
you pass it around *

04:45.950 --> 04:49.080
-* 97 bottles of beer
on the wall *
-DALE: Keep up.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.350
MRS. BASKETS:
You know, you would think
that was more popular.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.460
I'm glad to be out
of that behemoth. Okay.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.430
Lady Liberty!

05:01.460 --> 05:03.000
-We made it.
-Yeah.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.270
-Come on, girl.
-Oh, it's so beautiful.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.940
My tax dollars at work!

05:07.970 --> 05:10.310
We made it to the capitol!

05:10.340 --> 05:12.310
-DALE: Be a killer place
for a selfie.
-(siren chirps)

05:12.340 --> 05:15.280
(over P.A.): This is
a "no parking" zone, ma'am.

05:15.310 --> 05:16.450
Oh, honey, move the camper.
You can't park here.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.610
-Not it. Not it.
-Yeah,

05:18.650 --> 05:20.280
-I heard you, Dale.
Take the pie.
-Thank you.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.950
Ah, what is this,
Neoclassical Californian?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.790
-(engine starts)
-I have no idea,
but it is breathtaking.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.660
MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, my God!

05:30.490 --> 05:32.290
ATTENDANT:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.300
You can't park
that thing here, man.

05:34.330 --> 05:35.630
It's way too high.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.200
Okay, sorry.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.400
Here we go.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.240

DALE:
Hey, here we are on the steps
of the State Capitol!

Hi, everybody.
I'm Dale Baskets,

-Yeah, this is live, Mom.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.240
Oh, hi to my church group.
Hi, Maggie.

06:13.270 --> 06:15.570
-Okay, let's...
-We're in the, uh,
State Capitol.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.240
What else, Mom?
What else do you want to say?

06:17.270 --> 06:20.180
Oh, I love America,
and I love justice.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.210
Okay, so watch this, we're gonna
do the Statue of Liberty pose.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.250
-Go ahead, Mom.
-Oh!

06:23.280 --> 06:24.410
The Statue of Liberty!

06:24.450 --> 06:26.010
Yeah, there you go.
A little higher.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.350
There you go. Okay, let me just
back up a little,

06:28.380 --> 06:29.890

MRS. BASKETS:
Oh, my God.

I'm all right, sir, thank you.

You okay, Mama?

-Okay.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.860
Yeah, we're okay.
It happens often, actually.

-Is she okay?
-Yeah, she'll be fine.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.430

a lot as a family.
-Oh.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.440
Hey, uh, the pie's okay, Mom.

06:47.470 --> 06:49.710

Okay, we're right here in the,
the belly of the beast.

We're getting ready to
go through security.

There we go.
There goes Mama.

DALE:
And, uh, there's the apple pie.

A little damaged,

07:18.930 --> 07:21.140
talk to about those stairs?

-Has anyone else
tripped on those?

that thing's active, isn't it?
-Come on through.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.240
Okay, I don't have a belt buckle

It's fine, sir.

tell me I look like this?

-Sir, please remove your boot.

07:46.460 --> 07:49.260
-What?
-Please remove your boot.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.930
Remove my boot?
For what reason?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.670
These are American cowboy boots!

07:52.700 --> 07:54.670
-OFFICER 2: Your
ankle section, sir.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.970

What's in the boot?

DALE: What is going on?
I mean-- Oh, this thing?

07:58.510 --> 07:59.940
-It's just a switchblade.
-Whoa!
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh, honey!

07:59.980 --> 08:02.650
-It was a gift
from my cousin Douglas.
-Hold on.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.480
-OFFICER: Sir,
you are coming with us.
-What are you doing with a s--

08:04.510 --> 08:05.950
Are you in a gang?

08:05.980 --> 08:07.450
They're arresting me!
M-My hands are behind my back!

Where are you taking my son?

I can't bring an American knife
to a U.S. Capitol building?!

08:13.160 --> 08:15.490
MRS. BASKETS:
We've got to do
the bullet train thing.

08:15.520 --> 08:18.830
DALE:
Mom, it's up to you now!
Stop the bullet train, Mom!

08:32.740 --> 08:34.740
(brakes squeak)

08:38.850 --> 08:40.880
Hey, telephone?

08:40.919 --> 08:43.850
Directions to State Capitol,
please.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.320
Hello?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.390
(quietly):
Directions.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.360
(mutters)

08:51.390 --> 08:53.560
-(chimes)
-30 minutes?

08:56.430 --> 08:58.870
(mutters, exhales)

09:00.900 --> 09:02.400
(harmonica playing)

09:02.440 --> 09:06.840
Chip... parked 30 minutes away?
Where are you?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.380
Oh. Ah.

09:09.410 --> 09:12.210
Is this the line to be heard
on the Senate floor?

09:12.250 --> 09:15.550
-Uh, sure is. Yeah.
-Oh...

09:15.580 --> 09:17.520
I wish I would've thought
to bring a chair.

09:17.550 --> 09:20.890
Hmm. Hmm. Yeah.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.360
(sighs)

09:22.390 --> 09:24.930
(playing harmonica)

09:27.630 --> 09:30.730
(phone ringing)

09:30.770 --> 09:32.370
Hey, Christine, how's it going?

09:32.400 --> 09:35.200
Oh, I don't know.
It's all topsy-turvy.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.370
Dale got arrested
and Chip's wandering around

09:38.410 --> 09:40.710
who knows where
in Sacramento, and...

09:40.740 --> 09:43.710
and I can't remember
what I'm gonna say up there.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.750
I hate to say this, but...

09:46.780 --> 09:49.720
it is a lot of money
they're offering you.

09:49.750 --> 09:53.560
Money?
K-Ken, we're fighting this.

09:53.590 --> 09:55.120
I mean, think about it, really.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.460
Who is the rodeo benefiting?

09:57.490 --> 09:59.390
Chip loves the rodeo.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.060
Come on, does he?

10:01.100 --> 10:03.130
I mean, really, think about it.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.970
-(sighs)
-You'll do the right thing,
Christine.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.910
-Well...
-I have faith in you.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.610
(exhales): Oh!

10:12.640 --> 10:14.110
Okay, here we are.
I am being told

10:14.140 --> 10:16.440
that my First Amendment rights,
because I'm filming,

10:16.480 --> 10:17.910
uh, are in jeopardy.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.410
-Is that what you're saying?
-You can film

10:19.450 --> 10:21.150
as much as you want, sir.
We-we just want to know why

10:21.180 --> 10:23.420
-you brought a weapon
into the building.
-Oh! He wants to know

10:23.450 --> 10:24.820
why I brought a weapon
into the building.

10:24.850 --> 10:26.250
So I don't have my
Second Amendment rights, either.

10:26.290 --> 10:27.320
Is that, is that what you guys

10:27.360 --> 10:28.920
are telling me?
I mean, the message boards

10:28.960 --> 10:30.630
are gonna light up
on this thing.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.960
So, my First Amendment rights
are in jeopardy,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.760
-my Sec...
-(beeps)

10:34.800 --> 10:35.930
Oh, gosh.
Low battery.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.430
I'm losing the charge here.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.170
-Do you have a power cord
that I could borrow?
-No.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.610
-Ma'am?
-I left mine in my car.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.680
Well, go get it.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.140
Never mind,
that'll take too much time.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.350
Okay, uh...
all right, where was I?

10:50.380 --> 10:52.650
I was saying s-- It's dead.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.650
Phone's dead.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.320
Battery's gone.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.820
Hey, do you have a
auxiliary hole in that body cam?

11:01.820 --> 11:06.490
I am being illegally held here
in Sacramento at the, um...

11:06.530 --> 11:07.630
What is the name
of this building?

11:07.660 --> 11:09.830
-State Capitol.
-At the State Capitol!

11:09.870 --> 11:11.970
This is an SOS situation.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.140
I'm almost cuffed!

11:14.170 --> 11:16.340
-(indistinct chatter)
-(sighs)

11:21.880 --> 11:22.980
-Ooh!
-Oh!

11:23.010 --> 11:24.310
-God, I'm sorry.
-Oh, my God, are you okay?

11:24.350 --> 11:26.980
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.820
That's a great ensemble you got
there, though. (chuckles)

11:28.850 --> 11:31.690
-Oh, thank you.
I sewed this myself.
-Oh.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.060
Are-are you leaving?

11:33.090 --> 11:35.220
My feet hurt.
My family's supposed to be here.

11:35.260 --> 11:36.860
We have a business and...

11:36.890 --> 11:39.390
they're gonna do with that train
what they want anyways.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.360
Not necessarily.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.830
-No?
-I'd love to hear your story

11:42.870 --> 11:44.830
if you'd like to share it.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.530
Christine Baskets.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.170
(chuckles):
Hi. Come with me.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.840
-Nice to meet you.
-Our group has an area up front.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.910
-Oh, up front?
-Up front.

11:51.940 --> 11:54.380
-(gasps) You're a godsend.
-(chuckles)

11:55.940 --> 11:57.180
-(phone chimes)
-AUTOMATED VOICE: You have

11:57.210 --> 11:59.080
arrived at your destination.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.890
CHIP:
State Capitol Coffee?

12:04.750 --> 12:07.020
Ma'am, do you, do you know
where the, uh, State Capitol is?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.360
Uh, yeah, it's a couple miles
that way.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.760
Couple miles?

12:12.090 --> 12:13.100
(mutters)

12:13.130 --> 12:14.700
(chimes)

12:14.730 --> 12:16.200
Okay, Mom. Okay.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.700
(bicycle bell dinging)

12:17.730 --> 12:20.040
Hey! Excuse me!

12:20.070 --> 12:22.400
-Is your tricycle for hire?
-Yeah.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.570
Great. I need to go to the, uh,
State Capitol building.

12:26.610 --> 12:29.880
PROTESTER:
Every morning.
Every morning I wake up to it.

12:29.910 --> 12:32.550
-Ah, what's going on in here?
-PROTESTER: This is what's
happening in Fresno.

12:32.580 --> 12:36.280
-Oh, is this the hearing? Oh.
-It's louder than
a nuclear explosion.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.050
-What's her deal?
-The air is unsafe to breathe.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.260
This is what's happening
in Fresno!

12:41.290 --> 12:43.290
-Good day!
-SENATOR: Thank you.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.730
-(scattered applause)
-(grunts)

12:44.760 --> 12:47.260
We will now hear from
Robert Shockley of Palmdale.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.600
Oh, God.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.070
Hello.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.900
-(quietly): Oh, I know him. Yes.
-My name is Robert Shockley.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.140
And, yes, I currently live
in Palmdale. However, uh,

12:57.170 --> 12:58.570
my entire family
lives in Gilroy.

12:58.610 --> 13:02.240
And, uh, I had to move
to Palmdale after I...

13:02.280 --> 13:04.150
lost the use of both my legs

13:04.180 --> 13:06.820
because there was a cheaper
rehabilitation center there,

13:06.850 --> 13:10.620
and it's all
my insurance would cover.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.620
-Oh.
-I can't drive.

13:12.650 --> 13:16.090
A high-speed rail would allow me
to go home every weekend

13:16.120 --> 13:17.590
to be with my family.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.130
(quietly): Hey, don't worry
about going up there, okay?

13:19.160 --> 13:20.160
You're gonna be great.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.100
Just-- here's some
talking points.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.930
-Just work them
into your speech.
-Oh.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.430
You'll be golden.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.640
-Look at these.
-ROBERT: Do it for everyone

13:27.670 --> 13:32.440
who wants to stay in touch
with their families.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.310
-Well, I hope my kids make it.
-No matter how far away...

13:34.340 --> 13:37.110
-You know, they're on their way.
-...from the Central Valley
they live.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.120
-(bicycle bell dinging)
-Oh, look at that.
We're so close. There it is.

13:40.150 --> 13:43.290
Oh, actually, that's a one-way
the wrong way.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.350
You can't go that way.
You got to go around.

13:45.390 --> 13:46.960
I'll just get out here, then.

13:46.990 --> 13:48.460
Fine, no problem.

13:48.490 --> 13:50.360
That'll be 97 bucks.

13:52.860 --> 13:55.460
$97? I don't have $97.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.800
-Plus tip.
-Tip?

13:58.830 --> 14:00.470
-ROBERT: I thank you
for your time.
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.340
(applause)

14:02.370 --> 14:04.640
Thank you.
And now, we will hear

14:04.670 --> 14:06.310
from the California Bus Lobby.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.480
-That's us.
-Th-That's us?

14:08.510 --> 14:11.010
-Mm-hmm. Yep.
-We're the Bus Lobby?

14:11.050 --> 14:14.150
What the hell
is going on here?

14:14.180 --> 14:15.850
(camera clicking)

14:15.880 --> 14:18.320
Thank you, Senator.

14:18.350 --> 14:19.990
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you

14:20.020 --> 14:22.520
to a very important
small business owner

14:22.560 --> 14:24.160
from Bakersfield, California.

14:24.190 --> 14:27.660
Her name is Christine
and she owns a rodeo.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.230
A rodeo that would be destroyed

14:30.270 --> 14:32.170
by the bullet train.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.870
So, without further ado,

14:33.900 --> 14:35.400
Christine Buckets.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.070
What? What's this?

14:38.110 --> 14:40.380
"Sunset... Coach Lines"?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.580
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.050
(exhales sharply)

14:49.080 --> 14:50.550
MRS. BASKETS:
Anyway, I'm here...

14:52.250 --> 14:55.360
...uh, as owner
of the Baskets...

14:55.390 --> 14:57.890
Family Rodeo with my two sons

14:57.930 --> 15:00.730
and, uh...

15:00.760 --> 15:03.130
the bullet train
is off the rails.

15:05.430 --> 15:06.730
(man coughs)

15:06.770 --> 15:09.700
MRS. BASKETS:
Uh...

15:09.740 --> 15:13.880
"The bus is a better alternative

15:13.910 --> 15:17.550
than a bullet train,
so the bus stops here"?

15:17.580 --> 15:19.750
What is this about?

15:19.780 --> 15:21.550
Who wrote this?

15:21.580 --> 15:24.550
Oh, my God. Your Honor,
hold on, Your Honor.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.920
This is not...

15:26.960 --> 15:30.590
I-I'm not affiliated with him.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.560
-Um...
-SENATOR: Three minutes, ma'am.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.930
Three minutes?

15:34.960 --> 15:37.670
Oh, God, hold on.
Let me start again.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.970
You know, we were
minding our own business

15:42.000 --> 15:44.810
in Bakersfield, California.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.410
I'm Christine Baskets,

15:46.440 --> 15:49.440
owner of the
Baskets Family Rodeo.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.410
-And we got a flyer.
-Sir.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.750
A letter, really.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.120
And they said
a bullet train was coming.

15:55.150 --> 15:58.820
And that they'd give us
some money for our property

15:58.850 --> 16:00.990
but we didn't have nothing
to say about it.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.920
And I guess that's how
we ended up here,

16:02.960 --> 16:05.960
we have something to say
and now I'm here and...

16:05.990 --> 16:08.100
I...

16:08.130 --> 16:10.630
I loved what Robert said
about his family.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.970
It was beautiful.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.140
And I guess
I started thinking...

16:15.170 --> 16:18.310
I bought my rodeo
to be closer to my family.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.940
And it was wonderful
for a while,

16:20.980 --> 16:23.110
but I have to be
honest with you.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.610
I think I was fighting the train
for selfish reasons.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.280
And maybe it's not fair of me
to stop a train

16:29.320 --> 16:31.490
that's gonna connect
other families.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.120
You know, because really,
in my heart,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.490
-I should be in Denver.
-CHIP: Wait, what?

16:37.530 --> 16:39.290
MRS. BASKETS:
Huh?

16:39.330 --> 16:41.330
Oh. Sorry, Senators.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.830
This is Chip, who I was
talking about, my son.

16:43.870 --> 16:47.200
He, he doesn't know any of this;
I haven't discussed it with him.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.970
This is-- Chip, I just--
I had a revelation.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.710
You've got to hear
Robert's story.

16:52.740 --> 16:55.140
-Who's Robert?
-He's right here.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.550
He needs his family

16:57.580 --> 16:59.680
and that train's gonna put him
in contact with it

16:59.710 --> 17:02.020
-every week if he wants.
-Hi, Robert.

17:02.050 --> 17:05.720
Chip, maybe we should let
the train come through there.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.190
I think we've,
we've done everything we can

17:08.220 --> 17:10.329
-with that rodeo.
-(sighs) I mean, I be--

17:10.359 --> 17:14.030
-I became a CEO.
-And you did
a terrific job, honey.

17:14.060 --> 17:17.000
Yeah, but w-we had a plan.

17:17.030 --> 17:19.030
I think the train will help

17:19.069 --> 17:21.740
people like Robert
and other families connect.

17:21.770 --> 17:24.040
And isn't that what
we've been trying to do?

17:24.069 --> 17:25.670
Haven't we been
trying to connect?

17:25.710 --> 17:28.040
And that's why I bought
the rodeo, I wanted to connect.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.550
But now my home is--
and my life, Chip--

17:31.580 --> 17:34.420
it's in Denver with Ken.

17:34.450 --> 17:37.690
And I listened
to somebody on the way up here,

17:37.720 --> 17:39.050
on the radio,

17:39.090 --> 17:42.020
"The one change
in life is constant."

17:42.060 --> 17:43.560
-What?
-MRS. BASKETS: What'd they say?

17:43.590 --> 17:47.430
No. No. "The only constant
in life is change."

17:47.460 --> 17:49.200
That train's coming.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.200
That change is happening.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.700
And my granddaughter is bi.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.540
-What?
-Yes.

17:54.570 --> 17:58.040
I came here with him to protest

17:58.070 --> 18:01.110
the train, but I'm, I'm...

18:01.140 --> 18:04.210
I'm leaving here...

18:04.250 --> 18:07.950
in favor of it.
I'm leaving here in favor of it.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.880
-Okay.
-Chip, wait. You don't...

18:09.920 --> 18:11.890
Oh, my God.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.890
So sensitive.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.560
Oh... well, I'd like to thank

18:16.590 --> 18:19.260
the great state of California...

18:19.290 --> 18:21.900
for your time...

18:21.930 --> 18:25.270
and for being my home
for many, many years.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.340
I'll be thinking of you
when I'm in the Mile High City.

18:34.180 --> 18:35.810
-MRS. BASKETS: Chip?
-(sighs) I'm just gonna go

18:35.840 --> 18:40.280
-get the RV.
-Honey, you have to realize I...

18:44.450 --> 18:46.250
DALE:
Denver sounds like a blast
because I hear

18:46.290 --> 18:48.290
the thin air
makes you all freaky.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.960
You okay up there, Chip?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.830
I'm sorry I flip-flopped
on you, honey.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.600
I should have told you.

18:59.630 --> 19:02.340
I thought you were
a great CEO for our rodeo.

19:02.370 --> 19:05.110
It's nothing on you.

19:05.140 --> 19:07.980
People just don't want
cowboys falling off bulls

19:08.010 --> 19:10.650
as much as they want
their lickety-split commute.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.480
You know?

19:12.510 --> 19:14.020
CHIP:
I need to figure

19:14.050 --> 19:15.950
-this out.
-TAMMY: You were
supposed to make

19:15.980 --> 19:18.820
-a life plan.
-I-I... I-I tried.

19:18.850 --> 19:21.990
I did and-- but I-I-I
just couldn't finish it.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.660
Things got too crazy in my life.

19:23.690 --> 19:25.460
Do you know how many people
have said that to me?

19:25.490 --> 19:27.300
I don't know. A lot.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.160
(stammers)
The rodeo was, you know,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.300
a thing I put my energy into
and I thought,

19:32.330 --> 19:34.140
"Okay, this could be
a good thing, the rodeo."

19:34.170 --> 19:37.640
And now it's gone.
The rodeo's gone.

19:37.670 --> 19:40.310
And the-the clowning endeavor,
I-I have no-- I mean,

19:40.340 --> 19:41.980
my artistic endeav...

19:42.010 --> 19:44.680
Life is gone.
(hyperventilating)

19:44.710 --> 19:47.650
(stammers)

19:47.680 --> 19:50.180
I'm lost.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.850
-(panting)
-I want to help you.

19:52.890 --> 19:55.160
I, I really do.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.660
-(exhales sharply)
-And I know that I can,

19:57.690 --> 20:00.060
it's just that you have
to make a real commitment.

20:00.090 --> 20:02.560
Do you understand?

20:02.600 --> 20:05.330
Yeah. I-I realize that now.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.170
I-I do.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.100
Okay. Then just...

20:11.210 --> 20:13.010
...sign...

20:13.040 --> 20:14.210
right there.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.210
CHIP:
Okay. What is this?

20:17.250 --> 20:20.880
This is the best day
of your life.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.690
From now on,

20:24.720 --> 20:27.420
everything changes.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.520
(Tammy laughs)

20:29.560 --> 20:31.430
(sighs)

20:31.460 --> 20:34.560
You could be happy.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.600
