00:16.225 --> 00:18.519
Look at this. It's beautiful.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.187
Female?

00:20.771 --> 00:21.772
Queen.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.566
I think so. Look at the dorsal structure.

00:26.568 --> 00:30.489
SG-1 1 , archaeological survey.
P3X-888, dig-site four.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.241
- Five.
- Five.

00:32.366 --> 00:37.955
Subject: queen. Primordial Goa'uld - see
enlarged pectorals and dorsal structure.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.458
- This Goa'uld ancestor appears to be...
- Cleopatra.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.002
I found her. I get to name her.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.630
No! Cleo.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.343
Cleo, as she has been so colourfully
named by Robert Rothman,...

00:51.426 --> 00:54.596
..appears to have been a predator,
confirming my theory...

00:54.721 --> 00:59.434
..that the Goa'uld evolved for millions
of years before ever taking on hosts.

00:59.518 --> 01:02.688
Get a sedimentary time line
before we jump to conclusions.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.897
Testing for naqahdah level.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.446
Wow! Nothing. Not even trace amounts.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.740
We didn't find any in Brutus or Julius.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.619
It must become part of their Goa'uld
make-up later in their evolution.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.830
- How so?
- I have no idea.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.957
Let's crate this one.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.292
Loder!

01:30.883 --> 01:31.884
- Have some.
- No.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.469
Go ahead. Hawkins can make a water run.

01:35.262 --> 01:38.182
I love ordering those
military types around.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.642
Hawkins!

01:43.312 --> 01:46.273
Um... mark this one "Cleo" and...

01:46.732 --> 01:48.775
Don't ask.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.722
(rustling)

02:31.276 --> 02:32.903
Daniel!

03:36.175 --> 03:39.136
(PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.724
- It's SG-1 1 , sir.
- Open the iris.

03:48.187 --> 03:52.482
- Daniel's with them, isn't he?
- They're not due back for two more days.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.702
Dr Rothman, what is it? What happened?

04:04.620 --> 04:06.663
Where's the rest of your team?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.376
Loder's dead.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.754
Some sort of indigenous life form.

04:13.879 --> 04:17.132
It killed Loder.
The rest of my team went after it.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.510
- Daniel?
- No, no, no. It took Daniel.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.096
- That's why the others went after it.
- How long ago?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.224
I don't... maybe three hours.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.103
Daniel was still alive.
The thing was draggin' him!

04:30.229 --> 04:31.855
- You saw it?
- For a second.

04:31.980 --> 04:36.944
- Request permission to lead rescue.
- If I had to guess, I'd say it was an Unas.

04:38.737 --> 04:39.905
A what?

04:40.030 --> 04:44.910
It was like that thing that you described
in your mission report from Cimmeria.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.788
Basically, it's a Goa'uld
with teeth and claws, sir.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.832
- Not necessarily.
- What do you mean?

04:49.957 --> 04:54.086
Daniel believed that planet 888 was
where all Goa'uld symbiotes originated.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.047
Some Unas there may never
have been taken as hosts.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.426
We're still talking about a big,
stinky monster. Makes no difference.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.721
Indeed it does.
These Unas will be more primitive...

05:04.805 --> 05:07.516
..than Unas we have
previously encountered.

05:07.599 --> 05:11.270
What would a primitive Unas
want with Daniel?

05:11.395 --> 05:13.772
Recommend units one and two, P-90s.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.233
I also recommend
we take off right now, sir.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.527
- You have a go.
- Thank you.

05:55.606 --> 05:59.109
Grrrr...!

06:10.329 --> 06:12.789
Listen up! We're pressed for time,...

06:12.915 --> 06:15.918
..so this is gonna have to serve
as your mission briefing.

06:16.210 --> 06:20.839
Daniel Jackson has been dragged off
by a creature called an Unas.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.259
This is search and rescue.
Any questions?

06:24.510 --> 06:25.511
Uh...

06:25.636 --> 06:29.139
Yes, I have one. When were you
gonna tell me when we were leavin'?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.518
I wasn't.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.229
Oh.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.522
Move out.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.038
Stargate is secure, sir.

06:54.498 --> 06:58.168
- Make sure it stays that way, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

06:59.127 --> 07:04.258
Sierra Golf one-one-niner.
This is Sierra Golf one-niner. Come in.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.469
(O'Neill) Sierra Golf leader, do you read?

07:07.594 --> 07:12.224
Sir, the UAV is switched to automatic
and is flying a search pattern. Nothing yet.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.980
Daniel Jackson would have
radioed us by now if he were able.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.441
- What about SG-1 1?
- They could all be out of range.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.570
The Unas can traverse
great distances in a short time.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.114
Well, we know they're not here.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.533
Teal'c, take point.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.536
- Pierce, you got our six.
- Yes, sir.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.831
Rothman, you're with me.

07:53.807 --> 07:59.021
OK, I know it seems completely unlikely
you understand a word I'm saying, but...

08:00.063 --> 08:04.151
..l've gone about as far as I can go
at this particular pace, so,...

08:04.234 --> 08:07.821
..with your permission,
I'm gonna fall down now.

08:08.947 --> 08:13.577
Rest. This is a thing you should
become familiar with.

08:14.536 --> 08:18.832
Rest. It means, uh... rest.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.043
Grrrr!

08:22.211 --> 08:24.838
It's close. Try again.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.508
Grrest!

08:31.345 --> 08:33.138
This...

08:33.263 --> 08:37.726
This is, uh... nothing that
you need to be worried about.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.562
This is a radio.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.440
It's, uh...

08:43.524 --> 08:47.444
..so my friends can find me
and... shoot you.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.823
Uh...

08:51.907 --> 08:54.618
This is Daniel Jackson.
If anyone can hear me...

08:55.994 --> 08:58.038
Ugh!

08:58.580 --> 09:02.000
OK, I get it. No more radio. Radio bad.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.548
Do you speak any kind of language at all?

09:07.631 --> 09:11.927
I mean, you must be intelligent.
You made that necklace...

09:13.220 --> 09:16.974
..and... those... clothes...

09:19.768 --> 09:23.939
That was refreshing. Thank you.
I'm good for another ten miles.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.612
- Sir!
- Yeah?

09:30.696 --> 09:34.950
Fairly strong RDF signal. It's gone now.
Not long enough to triangulate.

09:35.033 --> 09:39.329
- So what does that mean?
- Daniel may have tried to use his radio.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.166
- Could be SG-1 1 .
- UAV picked up something.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.293
I can't explain why it died out.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.838
All right, let's pick it up.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.362
Yes.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.489
Rest. This is...

10:14.573 --> 10:17.326
This is good. This is... rest.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.349
This some sort of meditation or...?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.337
This is Dr Daniel Jackson.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.924
In case anybody finds this,...

11:15.926 --> 11:17.970
..l met a wonderful new friend...

11:18.095 --> 11:21.765
..and he's taking me on a long
journey to see his planet.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.018
I'm just making notes.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.694
At the moment my main concern
is that my new friend is...

11:35.153 --> 11:38.323
..an aboriginal Unas
in its un-Goa'ulded state,...

11:38.448 --> 11:41.451
..and that I'm the evening meal.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.456
It, uh...

11:47.916 --> 11:53.213
Rather, he appears to have an
underdeveloped chin and facial horns,...

11:54.173 --> 11:58.719
..which indicate he could be
a subspecies, possibly a juvenile.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.436
Grrrr!

12:09.730 --> 12:11.523
- Shut up?
- Grr!

12:12.399 --> 12:14.610
I understood that.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.866
We're communicating.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.744
Cha...

12:23.827 --> 12:24.328
Ka...

12:24.453 --> 12:25.787
Cha...

12:25.871 --> 12:26.455
Ka...

12:26.538 --> 12:28.123
Cha...

12:28.207 --> 12:28.790
Ka...

12:28.916 --> 12:30.417
Cha...

12:30.501 --> 12:31.251
Ka...

12:31.376 --> 12:33.420
Cha-ka.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.799
Chaka.

12:39.218 --> 12:42.221
Is that what you call yourself? Chaka?

12:43.764 --> 12:46.558
Daniel. I'm Daniel.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.979
Chaka's something else?

12:55.025 --> 12:57.402
Chaka is the moons?

12:59.071 --> 13:01.990
This is some sort of moon chant?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.410
The moons coming into alignment?

13:05.661 --> 13:07.704
Grrrr!

13:10.624 --> 13:12.835
Moon chant. What was I thinking?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.925
- Shesh!
- Shesh?

13:20.592 --> 13:23.929
- "Shesh." What is that?
- Chaka ke ka?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.932
Shesh!

13:27.099 --> 13:29.142
- Chaka ke ka.
- UAV.

13:29.268 --> 13:31.311
Shesh.

13:31.937 --> 13:35.774
UAV. This is my friends looking for me.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.943
Shesh!

13:38.485 --> 13:40.946
Chaka ke ka.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.575
You're frightened?

13:44.700 --> 13:47.870
It's OK. It won't hurt you.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.039
It won't hurt you.

14:06.180 --> 14:10.225
Sierra Golf one-one-niner.
This is Sierra Golf one-niner.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.352
Come in.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.940
We're somewhere on your six,
joining the search.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.151
Do you read?

14:19.276 --> 14:22.613
- Where the hell's Hawkins?
- UAV will have run out of fuel by now.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.781
Maybe an Unas got him.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.335
Hey!

14:39.963 --> 14:42.007
Water.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.803
Need water.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.654
Grrrr!

16:08.510 --> 16:11.054
(snarling)

16:38.749 --> 16:40.792
(snarling)

16:51.428 --> 16:53.972
(splashing)

17:09.279 --> 17:10.531
Ke ka.

17:14.576 --> 17:15.993
Ke ka.

17:16.662 --> 17:18.454
Ke ka!

17:19.164 --> 17:21.208
Ke ka.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.795
OK.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.631
Dead. "Ke ka" means dead?

17:28.507 --> 17:30.551
Danger?

17:34.012 --> 17:35.889
Ka! Ka!

17:36.890 --> 17:39.017
OK, "ka" means no.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.859
Right. I won't do that again.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.740
Loder was killed over there.

18:07.629 --> 18:11.842
He appears to have been killed
by a being of great strength.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.137
What was Loder doing?

18:15.262 --> 18:18.765
Packing up fossilised Goa'uld
for transport back to Earth.

18:19.808 --> 18:23.228
You weren't doing anything that
would've provoked an attack?

18:23.312 --> 18:25.355
I don't know.

18:26.148 --> 18:29.902
- Rothman, I'm so glad you came.
- OK, then. No, I doubt it very much.

18:29.985 --> 18:34.448
We've been here three weeks, doing just
what Loder's been doing for three weeks.

18:37.659 --> 18:41.330
Look at this.
They got off a helluva lot of shots.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.749
Our theory appears to be correct.

18:43.832 --> 18:47.586
The shape of these footprints
is consistent with that of an Unas.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.880
- Can you track it?
- Indeed.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.757
(Pierce) Colonel O'Neill!

18:52.382 --> 18:55.344
I found him just standing there,
staring off into space.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.471
Colonel.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.732
Where's the rest of your men?

19:08.857 --> 19:12.277
We were attacked.
Sanchez is dead for sure.

19:13.695 --> 19:17.616
I don't know what happened
after that. We got split up.

19:18.617 --> 19:21.161
I was hopin' some of them
might've made it back.

19:21.537 --> 19:25.541
- Oh, God.
- Major, we've been trying to contact you.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.466
My men are dead, aren't they?

19:40.138 --> 19:42.599
Look, Hawkins.

19:43.559 --> 19:48.605
We can't spare anybody to take you to
the Stargate. You'll have to stick with us.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.650
- Can you do that?
- Whatever you say, sir.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.239
Let's move out.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.264
Sir... I think we should rest.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.269
All right, go to ground. Boots on, no fire.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.230
I'll take first watch.

21:02.638 --> 21:06.808
Is this your cave? Your cave?

21:12.981 --> 21:15.359
It's nice.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.625
Nan.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.842
"Nan."

21:44.179 --> 21:48.225
"Nan" is... is Goa'uld? It's a symbiote?

21:51.812 --> 21:54.189
- Nan?
- Grrrr!

21:54.773 --> 21:56.817
Nan.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.489
"Eat". "Nan" is "eat".

22:03.282 --> 22:05.492
Of course.

22:06.160 --> 22:11.832
No, you know, if I am the main course,
I'd rather you fill up on the appetisers.

22:11.915 --> 22:14.710
So, no.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.628
Ka.

22:18.589 --> 22:20.048
Nan.

22:24.469 --> 22:25.554
Ka.

22:27.973 --> 22:31.143
- Nan!
- Ka.

22:32.936 --> 22:36.690
- Nan.
- Ka.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.650
(chuckles)

22:38.775 --> 22:40.819
Nan! Heh-heh-heh!

22:42.362 --> 22:44.239
Right. Yes.

22:44.656 --> 22:48.243
"Toss the Symbiote Head".
That's very, very popular.

22:48.368 --> 22:52.372
Very, very interesting.
Yes, all the kids are doing this.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.500
Uh-oh! Look out!

22:55.334 --> 22:57.377
In the fire. But...

23:04.009 --> 23:07.262
- Nan.
- Ka!

23:08.889 --> 23:11.016
Don't say "ka" till you've tried it.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.156
Nan.

23:36.875 --> 23:37.960
Mmm.

24:07.656 --> 24:09.116
(sighs with pleasure)

24:12.536 --> 24:14.580
Mmm.

24:16.290 --> 24:18.333
(gurgles)

24:19.251 --> 24:24.214
It's funny.
I met my father-in-law like this.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.179
(glugs)

24:32.306 --> 24:34.349
Yeah. Like that.

24:46.987 --> 24:49.031
- (whispers) Rothman!
- Mmm?

24:52.951 --> 24:54.995
What?

24:56.121 --> 24:58.081
Colonel?

24:58.207 --> 25:00.918
Did you notice anything weird
about Hawkins?

25:01.960 --> 25:04.171
- Weird?
- Different.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.882
- Different?
- Odd.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.385
- Odd?
- Rothman!

25:10.469 --> 25:13.096
I'm still not awake yet, Colonel.
I'm sorry.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.057
Well, you work with him.

25:15.307 --> 25:20.437
Just tell me if you notice
anything out of the ordinary.

25:26.485 --> 25:30.948
He seems like... Hawkins.
That's the way he is.

25:32.241 --> 25:36.245
- Are you sure?
- No. It's not my thing.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.706
- What isn't?
- People.

25:39.832 --> 25:43.252
With a million-year-old fossil,
I know what it had for breakfast.

25:43.377 --> 25:45.921
But I'm not too good at people.

25:47.381 --> 25:49.424
They're too recent.

26:07.234 --> 26:09.695
I'm in a cave.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.656
There are crude drawings. Pictographs.

26:13.365 --> 26:16.952
The Unas seems to comprehend
Goa'uld symbiote species structure,...

26:17.077 --> 26:19.371
..as well as their ability to blend.

26:20.539 --> 26:25.419
The Unas who were taken over figured
out how to work the Stargate and left...

26:26.461 --> 26:28.505
Why not all of them?

26:31.258 --> 26:34.428
This Unas wears
a strange, bony neckpiece.

26:34.553 --> 26:39.266
At first I thought it was ornamental, but
now I suspect it serves as a safeguard...

26:39.349 --> 26:42.853
..to protect against symbiotes
penetrating the neck.

26:49.985 --> 26:53.071
Some of the aboriginal Unas
must have realised...

26:53.197 --> 26:55.741
..their kind were being taken over,...

26:55.824 --> 26:58.285
..and taken refuge in these caves.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.634
This is a rite of passage.

27:15.552 --> 27:17.679
There are parallels in Earth culture.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.432
For example,
the Masai warriors of Africa...

27:20.516 --> 27:24.269
..kill lions in order to be
recognised as adult warriors.

27:27.898 --> 27:30.776
I think I understand
what it is you're doing.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.988
Wok tah.

27:36.448 --> 27:37.449
Ka!

27:43.080 --> 27:45.123
Ke ka.

28:10.649 --> 28:13.193
I think I've just been marked for death.

28:20.409 --> 28:22.870
(Carter) Teal'c! We're moving out.

28:49.563 --> 28:52.024
- Come no closer.
- What was that?

28:52.733 --> 28:55.652
- Lower your weapons.
- What?

28:58.322 --> 29:03.368
One or more of you may have become
host to a Goa'uld during your watch.

29:06.288 --> 29:08.165
That doesn't make any sense.

29:08.248 --> 29:11.001
You yourself may have
been compromised.

29:11.084 --> 29:13.378
Why do you think there are Goa'uld here?

29:13.504 --> 29:18.967
These waters abound with them. Anyone
who has ventured near the edge is at risk.

29:19.051 --> 29:22.054
No, the Goa'uld fossils we found
were millions of years old.

29:22.179 --> 29:26.475
- I've been on this planet for weeks.
- Perhaps you pretend to be human.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.478
I think I would know
if there was a snake in my head.

29:31.355 --> 29:33.982
- Carter?
- I can't explain it, sir.

29:34.066 --> 29:36.193
I don't even sense the ones in the water.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.696
Daniel and I found no traces of
naqahdah in the symbiote fossil.

29:39.822 --> 29:42.825
- Maybe that's why...
- Enough! Relinquish your weapons.

29:42.950 --> 29:45.494
Hold on! How do we know
you're not one of them?

29:45.786 --> 29:50.249
- Symbiotes can't blend with a Jaffa.
- Yeah? Look at my neck. You see a scar?

29:50.374 --> 29:53.794
The Goa'uld may enter through
the mouth, leaving no visible scar.

29:53.877 --> 29:57.214
It may be impossible to tell who
has been taken and who has not.

29:58.549 --> 30:03.679
Sir, Teal'c is right. He's the only one
we can be sure of, including you and me.

30:10.561 --> 30:12.604
Do as he says.

30:27.953 --> 30:31.123
- What about Daniel?
- None of you can be trusted to proceed.

30:31.248 --> 30:35.252
- You think you can bring him back alone?
- I do. And I will.

30:38.505 --> 30:41.216
- Sergeant Coburn.
- Coburn.

30:41.300 --> 30:45.137
One ormore ofour team may have been
compromised by a Goa'uldparasite.

30:45.512 --> 30:49.266
- How many?
- It may be impossible to determine here.

30:49.558 --> 30:52.644
- I intend to restrain them at this location.
- What?

30:52.728 --> 30:57.024
I will leave this frequency open so you
may locate them and return to the SGC.

30:57.149 --> 31:00.652
- Take extreme caution.
- We're on our way. Coburn out.

31:08.660 --> 31:14.333
Bind their hands and feet tight with those.
I will then do the same to you, O'Neill.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.375
Grrrr!

31:56.458 --> 31:58.335
It's OK.

31:59.878 --> 32:01.338
It's OK.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.096
Look.

32:10.138 --> 32:14.142
I can help you with that... if you let me.

32:17.855 --> 32:19.898
But you have to trust me.

32:32.786 --> 32:36.123
- I'm tellin' you, it's gotta be Hawkins.
- Trust in me, O'Neill.

32:37.249 --> 32:40.502
- What if I'm not O'Neill?
- Then I was not talking to you.

32:47.759 --> 32:50.137
What if an Unas comes by?
What do we do then?

32:50.220 --> 32:53.640
- Teal'c didn't have any other choice.
- Yeah?

33:06.612 --> 33:10.199
I don't suppose you know the story
of Androcles and the lion?

33:12.493 --> 33:14.620
Chaka.

33:15.329 --> 33:17.873
What is "chaka"?

33:24.796 --> 33:29.176
Look, obviously, we don't need
to be enemies here. I mean, uh...

33:29.259 --> 33:31.470
I wanna go home.

33:31.595 --> 33:34.431
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, it has been a hoot.

33:34.640 --> 33:38.560
But, uh... I did just pass up
a chance to kill you, so...

33:38.644 --> 33:39.728
Grrr!

33:43.649 --> 33:46.735
Please... Iet me go.

34:13.762 --> 34:16.306
This is ridiculous. I'm not a Goa'uld.

34:16.556 --> 34:21.018
Then why didn't you say so? Could've
straightened this whole thing out.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.692
So which one of you is it?

34:28.110 --> 34:32.030
All right. Anybody with a snake
in their head, raise their hand.

34:33.532 --> 34:35.576
Damn.

34:36.034 --> 34:39.121
Uh... Teal'c!

34:41.415 --> 34:43.375
(O'Neill yells) Teal'c!

34:43.917 --> 34:45.960
Teal'c!

34:47.295 --> 34:48.630
Teal'c!

35:03.270 --> 35:06.857
- That took you long enough.
- You are welcome, O'Neill.

35:10.277 --> 35:14.990
I knew if a Goa'uld was among you, he
would be strong enough to free himself.

35:19.244 --> 35:23.624
You had to wait long enough to make sure
Hawkins wasn't the only one.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.042
Yes.

35:28.629 --> 35:30.672
You satisfied now?

35:31.840 --> 35:33.884
I am.

35:34.301 --> 35:36.845
I'm glad that's over with.

36:01.787 --> 36:03.831
You gonna live?

36:04.498 --> 36:06.625
Yeah. I think so.

36:08.836 --> 36:11.797
Meet up with Coburn.
Get back to the Stargate.

36:12.047 --> 36:13.131
Yeah.

36:16.051 --> 36:18.428
How long do you figure
he was a Goa'uld?

36:18.554 --> 36:21.890
Could've been the whole time.
We just didn't know.

36:23.475 --> 36:26.019
They deserve a decent burial, sir.

36:28.146 --> 36:31.483
- Yes, they do.
- We'll take care of it, sir.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.861
Go find Dr Jackson.

36:36.864 --> 36:38.115
Yeah.

37:06.143 --> 37:08.812
(Teal'c) We're very close behind.

37:24.995 --> 37:26.955
That's red...

37:27.039 --> 37:28.749
There's not much of it.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.210
That's somethin'.

37:34.588 --> 37:36.632
(Teal'c) This way.

37:45.098 --> 37:47.142
You're good.

37:54.066 --> 37:58.779
I know this is the beginning of a beautiful
friendship, but will your folks understand?

37:58.904 --> 38:00.948
(growling)

38:11.625 --> 38:13.252
Grrrr!

38:39.153 --> 38:41.363
Ka! Ka ke ka.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.491
Ka nan chaka.

38:45.409 --> 38:47.870
Chaka ska nat.

38:47.995 --> 38:49.955
Chaka.

38:51.248 --> 38:53.709
Don't! Don't shoot!

38:58.922 --> 39:00.799
(roars)

39:14.438 --> 39:16.064
Cho ee che!

39:20.319 --> 39:22.696
This started out as
a sort of rite of passage.

39:22.779 --> 39:25.949
Maybe the alpha male was expecting
me to be offered as a feast.

39:26.074 --> 39:29.578
Cho chaka. Ka nan!

39:29.703 --> 39:33.123
But I think the younger one's
trying to bring me into his clan.

39:33.582 --> 39:37.336
- Why?
- We've communicated. We're friends.

39:38.795 --> 39:40.589
Friends?

39:42.216 --> 39:44.259
- Ka!
- Don't!

39:46.803 --> 39:51.850
I think the younger one's telling the clan
that he's found something good for them.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.978
- And they're buying that?
- No, I don't think so.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.356
Ka! Ke ka.

40:04.947 --> 40:07.074
- Daniel.
- What did you just say?

40:07.491 --> 40:10.661
I think I just asked him not to kill me.

40:14.206 --> 40:16.166
Grrrr!

41:13.056 --> 41:15.350
(roars)

41:22.608 --> 41:24.985
He's just become the alpha male.

41:27.738 --> 41:29.948
(snarls)

41:44.922 --> 41:48.091
Dan-eIll.

41:54.681 --> 41:56.725
Ka.

41:58.143 --> 42:00.521
I have to go now. Thank you.

42:07.903 --> 42:09.530
Chaka.

42:10.322 --> 42:13.200
Aaaaah.

42:33.428 --> 42:36.098
Chaka.

42:37.391 --> 42:39.601
What'd that mean?

42:39.685 --> 42:42.062
I have no idea.

42:46.608 --> 42:50.612
But I think I've just been invited
to come back one day and find out.
