01:51.385 --> 01:54.303
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

01:56.681 --> 01:59.766
lt's been a year since my last confession.

01:59.976 --> 02:02.659
l never told anyone this.

02:02.685 --> 02:07.083
Not my mom, the police, not my friends.

02:08.151 --> 02:14.403
Except for the ones who were there, and they're not around anymore.

02:16.116 --> 02:18.670
You see, l ...

02:18.696 --> 02:20.518
Yes?

02:24.707 --> 02:27.460
l killed a man.

02:28.837 --> 02:31.624
But it was an accident.

02:32.382 --> 02:36.842
A terrible accident, and l've tried to get past it, but l can't.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.019
Go on.

02:39.045 --> 02:43.238
l have these ... dreams.

02:44.351 --> 02:47.636
Really horrible dreams.

02:47.854 --> 02:51.555
This man is always there with me.

02:51.733 --> 02:53.353
He was a killer.

02:53.379 --> 02:58.840
He murdered Barry and Helen, but l got away with it.

03:03.369 --> 03:08.873
l guess l just need to deal with it, you know?

03:10.042 --> 03:12.793
Face the fear and the guilt.

03:13.879 --> 03:16.037
Finally say his name.

03:17.716 --> 03:20.835
Ben Willis.

03:23.388 --> 03:25.160
Ben Willis.

03:25.186 --> 03:27.280
l know.

03:32.687 --> 03:35.358
You know?
How could you ..?

03:38.111 --> 03:40.683
l know what you did last summer.

03:46.410 --> 03:51.071
Nice to see you find political science so stimulating, Miss James.

03:56.419 --> 03:59.253
Sorry.

04:09.681 --> 04:12.717
- Julie, wait. Are you okay?
- l'm fine.

04:12.934 --> 04:15.190
You sure? 
You don't seem fine.

04:15.216 --> 04:17.620
l had another dream, Will.

04:17.771 --> 04:20.069
The one in the shower?

04:20.095 --> 04:21.576
ln a church.

04:21.601 --> 04:24.192
God, it was so real.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.605
l thought the dreams were over.

04:27.781 --> 04:28.943
lt'll get better.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.677
lt can't get worse.

04:30.826 --> 04:33.725
l've freaked out in class before.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.473
l can't study, l can't sleep.

04:36.623 --> 04:39.160
l'm this close to failing school.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.742
Happy Fourth of July!

04:45.965 --> 04:47.505
lt was one year ago.

04:47.531 --> 04:49.608
lt's the anniversary.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.328
You've just got to take it easy.

04:52.354 --> 04:54.281
l'm really trying.

04:54.431 --> 04:56.969
Sometimes l wonder why l came here.

04:57.142 --> 04:59.009
To get out of Southport?

04:59.035 --> 05:01.212
Right.
Now l remember.

05:01.355 --> 05:04.473
Are you going away for the Fourth?

05:04.648 --> 05:07.159
l'll be studying for the finals.

05:07.185 --> 05:09.383
The joys of summer school.

05:09.529 --> 05:11.578
Are you okay?
Sure?

05:11.604 --> 05:14.298
You're definitely okay?

05:14.449 --> 05:17.653
Yes, l'm definitely okay.

05:17.828 --> 05:19.853
Thanks for the talk, Will.

05:19.879 --> 05:21.437
You're good to me.

05:21.583 --> 05:24.618
- l am?
- Yeah.

05:24.835 --> 05:27.576
Okay, l'll see you later.

05:27.602 --> 05:29.356
Okay. Bye.

05:35.262 --> 05:37.245
- Julie.
- Ray?

05:37.271 --> 05:40.991
God, what are you doing here?

05:41.141 --> 05:42.635
l got in early.

05:42.661 --> 05:44.452
Who was that guy?

05:44.603 --> 05:46.520
That's Will.
 He's a friend.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.671
You'd like him.

05:47.697 --> 05:49.196
We're just friends.

05:49.316 --> 05:54.227
All guys trying to pick up a girl try the "good friend" thing first.

05:54.404 --> 05:55.699
Ready to go?

05:55.725 --> 05:57.881
You know the drill.

05:58.033 --> 06:00.691
The Croaker Queen Pageant.

06:00.717 --> 06:03.478
Small-town fun, but nice.

06:03.621 --> 06:06.373
- Ray, l can't.
- Can't what?

06:09.293 --> 06:13.608
l feel like l haven't healed enough to go back.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.522
So please understand.

06:15.716 --> 06:18.502
- l understand.
- lt's not you.

06:18.718 --> 06:21.513
lt's all me. ln my head.

06:21.539 --> 06:23.867
l want to go back.

06:24.056 --> 06:26.577
l want to be fine, to be with you.

06:26.603 --> 06:29.123
l want it all to be like it was.

06:29.270 --> 06:30.299
lt just isn't.

06:30.325 --> 06:32.356
Why don't you stay up here?

06:32.382 --> 06:34.585
Fireworks over the river ...

06:34.733 --> 06:36.476
l have to work, Julie.

06:36.502 --> 06:39.170
My boat's in Southport, remember?

06:39.196 --> 06:40.488
But it's cool.

06:40.613 --> 06:47.232
You need your space from Croakerland and probably from me too.

06:48.412 --> 06:52.956
- Ray ...
- Just forget it.

07:00.549 --> 07:03.716
l'm scared, that's all.

08:44.355 --> 08:47.641
Shit.

10:24.448 --> 10:29.193
What the hell are you doing in my closet?

10:29.369 --> 10:30.798
l thought you left.

10:30.824 --> 10:33.606
l just wanted to borrow your skirt.

10:33.749 --> 10:36.256
Jesus, that was heart attack time!

10:36.282 --> 10:38.565
Can l have the knife now?

10:38.712 --> 10:40.867
Come out with me tonight.

10:40.893 --> 10:43.564
l just tried to stab you.

10:43.716 --> 10:46.430
l hardly feel like dancing.

10:46.456 --> 10:48.866
What's the matter?

10:49.013 --> 10:51.714
l think l hurt Ray's feelings.

10:51.740 --> 10:53.450
Listen to me.

10:53.642 --> 10:55.023
Ray is a great guy.

10:55.049 --> 10:57.083
Nothing against old Ray, -

10:57.229 --> 11:00.763
- but he's so ... Ray.

11:00.982 --> 11:02.832
He lives in Southport.

11:02.858 --> 11:05.800
Will lives right down the street.

11:05.946 --> 11:08.070
But there's nothing between us.

11:08.096 --> 11:09.670
Yet. Nothing yet.

11:09.824 --> 11:11.981
l'm working at the club.

11:12.007 --> 11:16.053
And you, Dancing Queen, are coming with me.

11:16.205 --> 11:17.703
No, l'm not ...

11:17.729 --> 11:19.296
Yes, you are.

11:19.322 --> 11:21.249
What did I say?

11:32.679 --> 11:35.632
You know what l want to do to you, right?

11:35.848 --> 11:39.976
- No.
- ls there a place we can be alone?

11:40.144 --> 11:42.579
l don't think so.
 lt's crowded.

11:42.605 --> 11:43.704
Come on.

11:43.857 --> 11:46.548
l just want to talk for a minute.

11:46.574 --> 11:49.835
lf it only takes a minute, no way.

11:49.986 --> 11:54.448
l'll talk real, real slow.

11:54.617 --> 11:55.892
Not at work.

11:55.918 --> 11:57.592
Do me a favour.

11:57.618 --> 11:59.847
Ask Julie to dance.

12:04.416 --> 12:08.166
You know, Jules, you're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight.

12:08.338 --> 12:11.872
Ty, you're an unstoppable force of nature.

12:12.049 --> 12:14.236
You better recognise.

12:14.262 --> 12:17.697
That's how my species survives.

12:17.887 --> 12:19.129
So, what's up?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.282
Wanna dance?

12:20.308 --> 12:22.788
Say yes.
 No means yes.

12:22.933 --> 12:25.174
Ty, have you seen my people dance?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.704
We do the mouth thing. 
Snap fingers.

12:27.855 --> 12:32.067
You can always just stand there and watch me.

12:32.234 --> 12:33.409
l have an idea.

12:33.435 --> 12:35.628
Why don't we all go dance?

12:35.779 --> 12:37.487
Let's go.

12:46.247 --> 12:48.281
Oh, what do you know?

12:48.307 --> 12:51.017
Will Benson, looking fine.

12:51.169 --> 12:53.423
Did you tell him l'd be here?

12:53.449 --> 12:56.400
l told him you wouldn't be here.

12:56.548 --> 12:58.472
And he came anyway.

12:58.498 --> 12:59.586
What's up?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.244
This wasn't my idea.

13:02.388 --> 13:05.258
- This wasn't ...
- You'll be fine. Do your thing.

13:05.433 --> 13:07.085
Be good, Julie.

13:07.111 --> 13:10.414
You want to get a drink?

14:34.348 --> 14:40.221
Hey ... 
Did you see something back there?

14:40.396 --> 14:47.311
l'm really sorry, but l've got to go home right now. l'm sorry.

15:27.690 --> 15:30.359
Morning.

15:32.361 --> 15:33.646
l love when they do that.

15:33.672 --> 15:35.471
That could break the machine.

15:37.408 --> 15:40.526
- That's Ty.
- My number's unlisted.

15:40.701 --> 15:45.780
Relax. We've been dating for three months and he is not a stalker.

15:48.252 --> 15:52.248
This is Mark in the Morning from Magic 96. 7 radio station.

15:52.421 --> 15:54.751
lt's Mark in the Morning!

15:54.777 --> 15:57.081
Put on the speakerphone.

15:57.107 --> 15:58.567
Oh, my God.
Hi.

15:58.719 --> 16:01.290
Hi, Mark. l'm Karla Wilson.

16:01.316 --> 16:05.031
WeII, what are you doing at home?

16:05.183 --> 16:07.611
l'm actually in school ...

16:07.637 --> 16:10.998
Want to win our magic getaway?

16:12.107 --> 16:14.696
I hope you remember your geography.

16:14.722 --> 16:17.089
What is the capitaI of BraziI?

16:17.278 --> 16:20.332
Okay. The capital of Brazil ...

16:20.358 --> 16:24.100
One question, one great getaway.

16:24.243 --> 16:26.595
KarIa, we need an answer.

16:26.621 --> 16:29.724
No Iooking it up.
Five seconds.

16:29.873 --> 16:36.076
- Four, three, two ...
- Rio de Janeiro!

16:36.296 --> 16:39.546
- Oh, no. Did you say Rio?
- No.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.534
Yes ..? Yes!

16:41.560 --> 16:45.117
You won the 96. 7 quickie getaway!

16:45.304 --> 16:49.348
A trip for four to Tower Bay IsIand in the fabuIous Bahamas!

16:49.516 --> 16:50.371
l can't hear.

16:50.397 --> 16:52.958
We'II caII back with the detaiIs.

16:53.104 --> 16:55.641
- What's your favourite station?
- 96.7!

16:55.814 --> 16:58.850
That's what I thought.

16:59.025 --> 17:01.415
Okay, who am l gonna take?

17:01.441 --> 17:05.669
Tyrell, my parents, cousins ... 
Okay, Julie.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.800
Mark said four tickets.

17:07.826 --> 17:11.518
So you have to think of someone to bring.

17:18.086 --> 17:21.289
Ray? Phone.

17:29.971 --> 17:33.008
- Hi.
- I'm reaIIy gIad you caIIed.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.207
l'm sorry.

17:34.233 --> 17:38.332
l shouldn't have left so fast.
 l just ...

17:38.521 --> 17:41.189
It's okay. 
Ray, Iisten ...

17:41.356 --> 17:47.062
Karla won a trip to the Bahamas, to this island called Tower Bay.

17:47.237 --> 17:49.670
She wants us to go with her.

17:49.696 --> 17:51.259
The Bahamas?

17:51.408 --> 17:59.285
It's a great chance for us to hang out in the sun, drink, swim ...

17:59.458 --> 18:03.953
... and, well, you know.

18:04.128 --> 18:07.497
- This weekend?
- Yeah.

18:07.715 --> 18:10.471
You wouldn't go away with me.

18:10.497 --> 18:13.825
lt's not you. lt's Southport.

18:13.971 --> 18:16.308
And, God, it's the Bahamas.
Free.

18:16.334 --> 18:18.953
You have to seII his ass on it?

18:21.060 --> 18:24.365
l really want us to be together.

18:24.391 --> 18:28.416
We're in the middle of a big run.

18:28.568 --> 18:29.891
lt's been crazy.

18:29.917 --> 18:31.709
We go back out later.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.132
l don't think l can make it.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.512
Will you try?

18:37.538 --> 18:39.102
For me, please?

18:39.245 --> 18:42.779
Yeah, l'll try, but ... Listen.

18:42.956 --> 18:46.320
If I don't make it up, go ahead.

18:46.346 --> 18:49.184
Have a reaIIy great time.

18:49.337 --> 18:53.038
Ray, for me, try, please.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.906
l really miss you.

18:54.932 --> 18:56.947
l miss you, too.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.965
Okay.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.093
Bye.

19:06.603 --> 19:10.138
Dude, we haven't caught dick for days.

19:10.164 --> 19:13.046
She asked you to the Bahamas.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.472
Fuck it, man.
You've got to go.

19:15.498 --> 19:17.261
l'll ride up with you.

19:17.446 --> 19:21.397
- Yeah. Stupid ...
- Yeah, stupid.

19:21.618 --> 19:25.449
What were you thinking, man?

19:25.621 --> 19:29.949
l'll show you what l've been thinking.

19:33.087 --> 19:34.469
Whoa, Ray. Damn.

19:34.495 --> 19:38.984
Thanks, but l'll need some time to think about it.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.689
Nice fit, huh?

19:40.715 --> 19:45.160
l'll call and tell her l'm coming.

19:45.305 --> 19:46.880
No, surprise her.

19:46.906 --> 19:48.665
She'll be psyched.

19:48.810 --> 19:53.719
Yeah. 
All right, clean up.

19:55.065 --> 19:57.447
Will you please forget about Ray?

19:57.473 --> 20:00.216
That boy has got fish on the brains.

20:00.363 --> 20:02.460
- Yeah, but ...
- But nothing.

20:02.486 --> 20:03.837
Where are we going?

20:03.990 --> 20:05.314
The Bahamas.

20:05.340 --> 20:08.428
Where are we going ..?

20:08.578 --> 20:10.866
The Bahamas!

20:21.506 --> 20:22.442
Try the harmony.

20:22.468 --> 20:24.105
You try it. l'll lead.

20:24.259 --> 20:26.427
You, lead?
 You suck.

20:26.453 --> 20:30.571
Fuck you.
 l sound just like him.

20:33.059 --> 20:36.347
You don't sound anything like him.

20:36.373 --> 20:38.208
Are you deaf?

20:38.355 --> 20:41.781
l'm quitting this band, man.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.885
l'm going solo.

20:44.028 --> 20:47.563
Oh, shit.

20:52.827 --> 20:56.446
- Let's just go on and find a phone.
- No.

20:56.624 --> 20:57.685
Come on.

20:57.711 --> 21:01.025
The guy looks dead, man.

21:01.210 --> 21:03.783
Maybe not.

21:05.214 --> 21:08.381
What are you doing, man?

21:21.855 --> 21:25.021
This is fucked up, man.

21:44.584 --> 21:47.254
Shit.

22:02.934 --> 22:04.892
Shit.

22:15.238 --> 22:17.231
Dave!

22:23.995 --> 22:26.783
No!

23:04.034 --> 23:07.734
Girl, it's getting down to the wire.

23:07.913 --> 23:09.800
He's not coming.

23:09.826 --> 23:12.184
l just thought ...

23:12.959 --> 23:16.594
You left him four messages. Four.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.152
He said he'd try.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.546
Try is like maybe, Julie.

23:21.572 --> 23:23.190
Try is bullshit.

23:23.344 --> 23:27.044
- He does work hard.
- My ass ...

23:27.222 --> 23:30.699
He's breaking your heart because he can.

23:30.725 --> 23:33.331
l hate to say l told you so.

23:33.519 --> 23:36.722
Then don't.

23:37.315 --> 23:40.399
Oh, my God.

23:40.568 --> 23:42.431
What's happening, lovers?

23:42.457 --> 23:44.542
Are we gonna get tropical?

23:44.696 --> 23:49.533
Let me talk to you for a minute ...

23:49.559 --> 23:52.184
What's up, Jules?

23:52.330 --> 23:54.983
Julie, l'm really sorry about Will.

23:55.009 --> 23:56.979
But he's my friend, too.

23:57.124 --> 23:59.331
My ticket shouldn't go to waste.

23:59.543 --> 24:02.764
Where there's a Will, there's a way.

24:02.790 --> 24:05.025
Let's start having fun!

24:05.174 --> 24:08.507
ls there a problem?

24:08.677 --> 24:13.174
No, there's no problem, because we're going to the Bahamas.

24:13.349 --> 24:15.358
You're goddamn right.

24:15.384 --> 24:19.209
Right. We're going to the Bahamas!

24:27.737 --> 24:31.613
l'm in the exit row.
Wrong row.

24:31.639 --> 24:34.013
Are you okay?

24:34.159 --> 24:38.027
Yeah, l'm fine.

24:38.247 --> 24:42.539
Think of happy memories from your childhood.

24:42.709 --> 24:45.231
And if l don't have any?

24:45.257 --> 24:49.353
l can't relax going 500 miles an hour.

24:49.508 --> 24:51.735
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.

24:51.761 --> 24:54.323
Planes go down for no reason at all.

24:54.469 --> 24:57.055
Getting hit by lightning is ...

24:57.081 --> 25:00.415
Yeah, and planes hit other planes.

25:00.560 --> 25:05.635
You're gonna get hit if you don't quit bitching.

25:05.814 --> 25:08.731
Some folks just can't fly.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.224
l'm the king of the world!

25:14.250 --> 25:17.259
l'm the king of the world!

25:17.450 --> 25:19.635
Just breathe, Tyrell.

25:19.661 --> 25:22.053
Get away from me.

25:22.204 --> 25:23.279
lt's not a macho thing.

25:23.305 --> 25:25.267
lt's about equilibrium in your inner ear.

25:25.417 --> 25:28.739
You just have to get used to it.

25:28.765 --> 25:31.775
Some folks just can't sail.

25:31.922 --> 25:38.670
And it's the only way on or off the island, except for the coast guard.

25:38.845 --> 25:40.561
lt looks pretty remote.

25:40.587 --> 25:43.496
Tourists want sun, sea, solitude.

25:43.641 --> 25:45.155
How much longer?

25:45.181 --> 25:46.780
A few minutes.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.518
Hang in there.

25:48.646 --> 25:49.461
Let it out.

25:49.487 --> 25:51.043
Just watch the boat.

26:14.670 --> 26:21.289
lf there's anything l can do to make your stay better, please just ask.

26:22.428 --> 26:23.427
l'm Darick.

26:23.453 --> 26:27.446
l'll be at your service for the duration of your stay.

26:27.598 --> 26:30.640
Old man, l have to work fast.

26:30.666 --> 26:33.497
The season's almost over.

26:33.689 --> 26:37.085
With this weather you're already out of time.

26:37.111 --> 26:38.624
Old man, my ass.

26:38.650 --> 26:41.486
- Beautiful.
 - Look at this.

27:02.965 --> 27:04.168
We are here.

27:04.194 --> 27:07.202
We have arrived in paradise!

27:12.891 --> 27:16.211
You've got to be shitting me ...

27:16.237 --> 27:18.207
Look at this cat.

27:18.397 --> 27:20.456
Yo, what's up, my brother?

27:20.482 --> 27:23.331
l think we found your brother.

27:23.484 --> 27:27.399
- Your brother.
- You know what l was saying ...

27:27.572 --> 27:30.028
Are you looking for some bud?

27:30.200 --> 27:31.833
l got some bat guano.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.724
l got the cream jeans.

27:33.870 --> 27:36.870
Anything you need, Titus got.

27:37.039 --> 27:39.648
No, but thank you very much.

27:39.674 --> 27:43.398
What about the sweet young ladies?

27:43.545 --> 27:45.567
Anything l can do?

27:45.593 --> 27:47.614
Take a bath.

27:47.757 --> 27:50.508
Damn, that's cold, woman.
 All right.

27:50.676 --> 27:55.173
lf you need some weed, l'll get with you later.

27:55.599 --> 27:58.787
What's up?
 Looking for the disco?

27:58.813 --> 28:00.165
Beat it.

28:22.373 --> 28:25.042
Hello?

28:30.297 --> 28:31.657
Where is everyone?

28:31.682 --> 28:33.193
Good question.

28:35.427 --> 28:38.593
Excuse me ... Excuse me.

28:41.308 --> 28:45.351
l'll scare somebody up. 
Hello?

28:45.518 --> 28:48.889
Yo ..? Shit!

28:57.572 --> 28:59.371
What can l do for you?

28:59.397 --> 29:02.011
Checking in. 
Karla Wilson.

29:02.161 --> 29:03.219
Oh, yes.

29:03.245 --> 29:07.475
Well, let's roll out the red carpet.

29:07.665 --> 29:09.539
Our contest winners are here.

29:09.709 --> 29:10.774
Last name first.

29:10.800 --> 29:11.906
First name last.

29:11.932 --> 29:14.195
Nice dog you got there, man.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.863
Not really.
 He eats guys like you.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.784
You got a problem with something?

29:19.927 --> 29:22.369
l don't have problems, pal.

29:22.395 --> 29:25.740
This is such a beautiful hotel.

29:27.518 --> 29:32.143
Built in the 1930's for one of the Rockefeller clan.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.222
There's a lot of history here.

29:33.248 --> 29:34.289
Judy Garland spent the night here.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.819
President Nixon ...

29:35.845 --> 29:38.166
Okay.
We get it. lt's old.

29:38.319 --> 29:41.302
lt'll outlive you, l'm sure.

29:41.328 --> 29:43.883
Put that down, please.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.484
Sorry.

29:49.079 --> 29:53.321
"Wilson" ... comma.

29:53.347 --> 29:55.356
"Karla."

29:57.337 --> 30:01.464
Oh ...
You're in 201 and 202.

30:01.632 --> 30:03.723
ls that a bad thing?

30:03.749 --> 30:05.664
No, not at all.

30:05.690 --> 30:07.223
Not at all.

30:07.347 --> 30:10.343
Those are our honeymoon suites.

30:10.369 --> 30:11.914
Your what?

30:12.059 --> 30:16.352
l take it you kids haven't exchanged vows.

30:16.521 --> 30:18.876
We haven't exchanged anything.

30:18.902 --> 30:20.301
Julie, come on.

30:20.327 --> 30:21.910
That'll be fine.

30:22.069 --> 30:29.232
Our off-season staff of five will tend to your every need.

30:29.408 --> 30:31.340
Did you say off-season?

30:31.366 --> 30:34.559
lt's the Fourth of July weekend.

30:34.748 --> 30:38.614
Storm season begins today like clockwork.

30:38.792 --> 30:41.709
lt's our version of winter.

30:44.131 --> 30:45.794
That's 201 and 202.

30:45.820 --> 30:49.233
Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lounge.

30:49.428 --> 30:52.677
Enjoy.

30:52.847 --> 30:55.655
Ain't nothing free in this world.

30:55.681 --> 30:58.744
l wanted you to have a great trip.

30:58.936 --> 31:01.068
We will.
Don't worry about that.

31:01.094 --> 31:03.290
We got the island to ourselves.

31:03.441 --> 31:06.348
And it's been blue skies all day.

31:06.374 --> 31:08.839
Guys, this is us. 202.

31:08.987 --> 31:13.565
- The bags.
- 201 and 202.

31:13.741 --> 31:16.778
- Don't use these much.
- Why?

31:16.953 --> 31:17.919
No reason.

31:17.945 --> 31:21.806
They're fancy rooms for kids your age.

31:21.958 --> 31:23.724
We won a competition.

31:23.750 --> 31:26.608
And what did you have to do?

31:26.795 --> 31:30.414
- Guess the capital of Brazil.
- Rio, baby.

31:31.843 --> 31:33.424
Good for you, girl.

31:33.450 --> 31:37.026
And where would you like l put your bags?

31:37.179 --> 31:40.656
You can put our stuff back here.

31:40.682 --> 31:42.746
You promised.

31:42.894 --> 31:45.044
l also promised Tyrell.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.125
What's up?

31:46.151 --> 31:48.364
You're killing me.

31:48.482 --> 31:53.309
l can sleep on the couch so they can practice that real honeymoon.

31:53.486 --> 31:58.233
l've been doing this since before you were a gleam in your dad's eye.

31:59.868 --> 32:01.662
You sure it's cool with you?

32:01.688 --> 32:04.186
Sure. As long as you don't snore.

32:04.330 --> 32:08.993
lf l get out of hand, you can toss something at me.

32:15.841 --> 32:17.489
He looks pretty beat up.

32:17.515 --> 32:19.781
Yeah. But he seems certain.

32:19.929 --> 32:26.726
His friend was killed by a Ben Willis, who had a hook on his hand -

32:26.894 --> 32:30.428
- and was driving a BMW.

32:31.689 --> 32:33.281
Look, there's no body.

32:33.307 --> 32:35.332
No other vehicle involved.

32:35.485 --> 32:42.650
He feel asleep at the wheel, crashed his truck and fell into a ditch.

32:42.867 --> 32:46.014
He suffered severe head trauma.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.392
lt'll all come back to him.

32:51.750 --> 32:55.285
Doctor, number three just flatlined.

32:57.713 --> 32:58.974
Get me some help.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.522
l've got a flatline, room three.

33:14.438 --> 33:18.021
Let's get a couple of drinks.

33:18.192 --> 33:21.441
Oh, shit.

33:21.611 --> 33:24.731
- This bar is ...
- Empty?

33:24.906 --> 33:26.775
You boys lost?

33:26.801 --> 33:30.139
Wow, a human being.

33:30.287 --> 33:32.984
Tell me this isn't the bar scene.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.890
You want a drink?

33:35.082 --> 33:37.897
We didn't dress up for nothing.

33:37.923 --> 33:40.101
You're dressed up?

33:40.254 --> 33:46.540
All right, Will, we got a Planter's Punch, a Singapore Sling ...

33:46.718 --> 33:50.882
How about a Mai-motherfucking-Tai?
Yeah ...

33:51.097 --> 33:54.172
How about some lD ..?

33:54.198 --> 33:56.246
l'm kidding.

33:57.770 --> 34:00.369
This place isn't quiet, it's dead.

34:00.395 --> 34:01.923
Well, it's ...

34:02.108 --> 34:03.852
The last day of the season.

34:03.878 --> 34:05.750
Why are you still here?

34:08.321 --> 34:12.235
That's none of your goddamn business.

34:12.451 --> 34:15.368
l think l smell man trouble.

34:15.393 --> 34:17.268
Not anymore.

34:17.456 --> 34:19.455
Did he dump you?

34:19.481 --> 34:22.105
No. l shot him.

34:25.880 --> 34:30.172
Now, what you boys want is a Dark and Stormy.

34:30.342 --> 34:33.590
A little rum, ginger beer, Tabasco.

34:33.616 --> 34:35.657
lt's good.
Trust me.

34:35.804 --> 34:36.810
Am l bad?

34:36.835 --> 34:39.960
He's kind of cute, right?

34:40.101 --> 34:43.304
And he has a crush on you. But?

34:43.331 --> 34:45.500
But l miss Ray.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.862
l really do.
l tried to call him.

34:47.888 --> 34:49.967
Ray made up his own mind.

34:50.110 --> 34:51.449
So you're free.

34:51.475 --> 34:56.469
For 48 hours, your smile is a frown turned upside down.

34:57.576 --> 34:59.194
Here comes my baby.

34:59.220 --> 35:01.432
You like the outfit?

35:01.579 --> 35:03.781
No, l love it.

35:03.807 --> 35:06.480
Cool bar, right?

35:06.626 --> 35:09.305
They all look the same, once you've worked in one.

35:09.331 --> 35:10.066
Right, sister?

35:10.212 --> 35:12.223
You look beautiful.

35:12.249 --> 35:13.561
l'm Julie.

35:13.587 --> 35:15.553
This is Karla.

35:15.677 --> 35:19.804
Nancy.
Well, welcome to Tower Bay's most happening hot spot.

35:19.972 --> 35:23.590
Our room is the happening hot spot.

35:23.767 --> 35:25.848
Four Dark and Stormies.

35:25.874 --> 35:29.129
All right.
 To a great weekend.

35:29.271 --> 35:32.060
Screw the weather.

35:35.863 --> 35:38.068
What do you do around here for fun?

35:38.239 --> 35:40.833
Make fun of tourists.

35:40.859 --> 35:45.430
Or let them make fun of themselves.

35:45.580 --> 35:46.835
Karaoke.
Perfect.

35:46.861 --> 35:49.519
That's what l'm talking about.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.661
Don't even think about it.

35:51.687 --> 35:54.691
Don't listen to the party-poopers.

35:54.838 --> 35:58.373
This is for someone who needs it.

35:58.550 --> 36:01.337
- So one single with extra cheese.
- No.

36:01.553 --> 36:04.837
- Yes, Julie.
- No ... No!

36:05.055 --> 36:06.879
What did l say?

36:06.905 --> 36:09.133
Come on, Julie.

36:09.159 --> 36:10.941
Come on ...

36:12.314 --> 36:14.981
Julie in the house!

36:15.148 --> 36:21.317
Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause for my very best friend.

36:21.488 --> 36:22.945
Julie James!

36:22.971 --> 36:25.754
Julie in the house.

36:25.780 --> 36:27.243
Julie ...

36:30.538 --> 36:32.892
All right ...
Thank you, Karla.

36:32.918 --> 36:34.512
You're welcome.

36:44.009 --> 36:46.132
Are you happy?

36:55.979 --> 36:58.766
Hi, Will ...

37:11.118 --> 37:13.109
Everyone's a goddamn singer.

37:17.290 --> 37:20.410
l don't know the lyrics.
Hold on.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.110
lt's him.

37:27.136 --> 37:31.625
He did something to the screen.

37:31.651 --> 37:33.908
l swear to God.

37:34.057 --> 37:35.327
Julie, what's wrong?

37:35.353 --> 37:37.450
l swear to God, it said ...

37:39.477 --> 37:43.787
Julie, what are you talking about?

37:43.813 --> 37:45.587
Nothing.

37:45.734 --> 37:49.600
Where are you going? Julie?
Shit ...

38:45.622 --> 38:48.788
Oh, my God. Will, l'm so sorry.

38:48.814 --> 38:50.855
lt's my fault.

38:51.044 --> 38:52.311
l shouldn't have.

38:52.337 --> 38:53.504
l didn't think.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.069
This is so sweet.

38:55.095 --> 38:56.088
l'm sorry.

38:56.216 --> 38:58.592
l scared you.
l crossed the line.

38:58.618 --> 39:01.282
You scared me, but l'm on edge.

39:01.429 --> 39:05.129
- Sorry.
- Don't apologise. l'm the one ...

39:05.307 --> 39:09.008
l understand.

39:09.228 --> 39:12.312
l'm just gonna take a walk.

39:12.481 --> 39:16.348
Are you sure?

39:24.200 --> 39:26.827
l just really like you a lot.

39:26.853 --> 39:29.931
l want you to have a great time.

39:30.082 --> 39:33.496
l want you to be happy.

39:44.594 --> 39:48.545
l'll just grab a few things here.

39:51.017 --> 39:54.468
God, l'm sorry.

39:58.566 --> 40:01.686
Sorry.

40:10.618 --> 40:11.833
Bounce, baby.

40:11.859 --> 40:13.728
You know what?

40:13.872 --> 40:18.580
l've decided to change my major to finance.

40:18.751 --> 40:21.581
And l'm going to Wall Street.

40:21.607 --> 40:23.070
You know why?

40:23.214 --> 40:27.875
Because it's the only way l can afford a big-ass bed like this.

40:28.050 --> 40:32.345
Show me some love on this big-ass bed.

40:32.514 --> 40:33.771
Oh, a Jacuzzi.

40:33.797 --> 40:37.117
Come on, let's stay right here.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.643
l spent $1 00 on a bathing suit.

40:40.669 --> 40:45.046
You can pull it off, but l'm wearing it.

40:45.193 --> 40:48.312
You didn't mention that earlier, sexy thing.

41:49.210 --> 41:51.069
You scared the shit out of me!

41:51.095 --> 41:53.447
You're living your life in fear.

41:53.590 --> 41:55.718
lt's time for manhood.

41:55.744 --> 41:59.903
There's a kick-ass party on the mainland.

42:00.055 --> 42:04.966
l'm saying we take the boat and get jiggy with it.

42:05.143 --> 42:07.061
l have to tie the boat.

42:07.087 --> 42:09.145
There's a storm coming.

42:09.171 --> 42:11.087
Then l'm going to bed.

42:11.232 --> 42:12.259
And that's it?

42:12.285 --> 42:14.707
That's all l got for today.

42:14.901 --> 42:17.072
Take the bake elsewhere.

42:17.098 --> 42:19.719
All right ... Bullshit.

42:19.906 --> 42:24.532
You need to take a chill pill.

42:24.702 --> 42:27.081
Have a good time, bro.

42:27.107 --> 42:29.269
l will, buddy.

42:37.881 --> 42:40.882
Titus!

42:43.136 --> 42:45.509
Oh, damn it.

42:45.682 --> 42:49.677
Very funny, asshole.

42:52.145 --> 42:55.728
Hey, give me a hand, would you?

43:24.009 --> 43:25.174
Long distance.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.446
l need an international operator.

43:59.499 --> 44:02.453
Come on!

44:21.019 --> 44:23.890
Housekeeping.

44:37.536 --> 44:40.701
Housekeeping.

45:36.256 --> 45:38.017
What, what, what?

45:38.043 --> 45:41.358
Have you seen my hair tie?

45:41.512 --> 45:42.989
l'm sorry, baby.

45:43.015 --> 45:46.613
l just don't want to get my hair wet.

45:46.766 --> 45:49.301
l finally got you in this Jacuzzi.

45:49.327 --> 45:51.785
Let's not talk about hair care.

45:51.937 --> 45:53.567
Don't get feisty.

45:53.593 --> 45:56.755
lt's too late for all that.

45:56.943 --> 45:59.583
We're miles away from anybody.

45:59.609 --> 46:02.424
So nobody can hear you scream.

46:02.615 --> 46:04.864
l used to be a lifeguard.

46:04.890 --> 46:08.760
And please don't make me blow my whistle.

46:08.913 --> 46:15.448
l'd just hate for you to blow ... your whistle.

46:20.257 --> 46:22.783
No water sports after midnight.

46:22.809 --> 46:24.030
Hotel policy.

46:24.177 --> 46:26.756
What's the policy on burning herb?

46:26.782 --> 46:29.741
You can't try it till you buy it.

46:32.475 --> 46:35.233
What's up?
 lt's all good.

46:35.259 --> 46:38.455
Believe me, it is all good.

46:40.025 --> 46:43.191
Crazy freak.

46:47.074 --> 46:49.825
Now, where was l?

46:56.999 --> 47:00.783
- Hey, guys. lsn't this beautiful?
- Damn.

47:01.002 --> 47:05.130
1 0 people on this island, and they all end up in this Jacuzzi.

47:05.298 --> 47:07.455
How's the water?

47:07.481 --> 47:09.367
Crowded.

47:09.510 --> 47:11.377
How's Julie doing?

47:11.403 --> 47:14.826
She's up in her room alone.

47:14.974 --> 47:16.313
Any advise?

47:16.339 --> 47:19.625
Find another Jacuzzi.

47:19.770 --> 47:22.419
You can't give up so easy.

47:22.445 --> 47:25.500
You've got to hang in there.

47:25.692 --> 47:28.728
lt's great, isn't it?

47:28.904 --> 47:31.069
l can't win.

47:31.095 --> 47:33.258
l can't ...

47:45.503 --> 47:48.253
Will?

49:05.786 --> 49:09.570
Where the hell's my toothbrush?

50:23.109 --> 50:26.311
- Hey, l know, l know ...
- Will!

50:26.528 --> 50:29.564
Will! lt's happening again.

50:31.324 --> 50:34.325
What happened?

50:39.207 --> 50:42.492
l do not find this at all funny.

50:42.710 --> 50:44.246
There was a body.

50:44.272 --> 50:45.356
l swear it.

50:45.504 --> 50:48.475
Maybe you were dreaming.

50:48.501 --> 50:50.358
l wasn't.

50:50.510 --> 50:54.636
l knew you were gonna be trouble the moment l laid eyes on you.

50:54.804 --> 50:56.182
Listen to me.

50:56.208 --> 50:57.348
He's here.

50:57.374 --> 50:59.705
What's going on?

50:59.851 --> 51:02.929
Julie says she saw a dead guy in the closet.

51:02.955 --> 51:04.703
All we see is bathrobes.

51:04.897 --> 51:07.188
You think this is funny?

51:07.214 --> 51:09.289
l'm not going crazy.

51:09.315 --> 51:10.842
He was in there.

51:10.987 --> 51:13.309
Oh, yeah?
 Then where is he now?

51:13.335 --> 51:15.056
Where's the dead guy?

51:15.239 --> 51:17.940
What did you actually see?

51:17.966 --> 51:22.014
The dockhand hanging by his neck.

51:22.163 --> 51:29.992
Look, tomorrow we'll talk to Darick and put this whole thing to rest.

51:30.172 --> 51:35.378
So let's slow down on the Dark and Stormies and get some sleep.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.742
l want off this island.

51:37.768 --> 51:40.196
That's not possible.

51:40.346 --> 51:44.594
The last ferry left hours ago, and we have a storm coming.

51:44.768 --> 51:48.136
l'll call the mainland for a boat.

51:48.162 --> 51:51.329
The phones just went down.

51:55.236 --> 51:58.072
lt's dead.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.341
Listen up.

51:59.367 --> 52:03.768
The next couple of days will be rough, but we'll make it.

52:03.952 --> 52:05.439
What about a radio?

52:05.465 --> 52:07.263
Emergencies only.

52:07.414 --> 52:12.575
You city kids wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up your ass.

52:16.173 --> 52:18.092
This is not a drill.

52:18.118 --> 52:22.531
All we can do is batten down and ride it out.

52:22.678 --> 52:27.672
And if it gets really bad, we have a storm shelter. Goodnight.

52:54.667 --> 52:59.743
Pain of the past, fear of the future, blood of the young.

52:59.921 --> 53:03.876
Pain of the past, fear of the future,..

53:03.902 --> 53:06.032
..blood of the young.

53:06.178 --> 53:10.720
Pain of the past, fear of the future ...

53:10.890 --> 53:13.844
... blood of the young.

53:26.947 --> 53:30.221
Yeah, that's my babies.

53:30.247 --> 53:34.516
You all growed up real good.

53:47.049 --> 53:49.874
Where are you hiding?

53:49.900 --> 53:54.204
Come to Papa, come to Papa ...

53:54.347 --> 53:58.510
Yeah, that's it.

53:58.726 --> 54:01.264
Got to find that damn lighter ...

54:12.656 --> 54:16.405
Can l help you?

54:16.994 --> 54:20.362
Goddamn it!

54:23.749 --> 54:26.455
Oh, God ...

54:28.005 --> 54:30.324
What are you doing?
No.

54:30.350 --> 54:33.070
Seriously, don't do that.

54:36.303 --> 54:40.384
Oh, God ... Jesus, no!

54:40.558 --> 54:42.930
lt's all good!

55:07.958 --> 55:10.627
Can l help you?

55:20.178 --> 55:21.845
That's a full carat.

55:21.871 --> 55:23.121
How much?

55:23.265 --> 55:25.952
She's got some flaws in her.

55:25.978 --> 55:27.417
How much?

55:27.560 --> 55:32.601
l don't have much of a market for this kind of thing.

55:32.814 --> 55:34.729
200. Maybe 250.

55:34.755 --> 55:37.051
Make it 300.

55:39.238 --> 55:42.238
And throw in that, too.

55:44.992 --> 55:46.931
Which one you talking about?

55:46.957 --> 55:48.039
 You're crazy.

55:48.065 --> 55:50.095
That's worth 300 by itself.

55:50.248 --> 55:52.709
Then there's the waiting period.

55:52.735 --> 55:55.812
Keep the ring and give me the gun.

56:08.306 --> 56:10.685
You sure you want to go this way?

56:10.711 --> 56:12.079
ls it loaded?

56:12.226 --> 56:14.800
- No.
- Load it.

56:27.825 --> 56:30.362
Get the hell off of me.

56:32.537 --> 56:34.494
Baby, this is bullshit.

56:34.520 --> 56:38.517
This ain't the romantic weekend l had in mind.

56:38.709 --> 56:42.244
Hey, Jules, get any sleep?

56:42.421 --> 56:45.506
- Some.
- Look at that.

56:45.675 --> 56:51.711
Another beautiful day in paradise with Julie as our tour director.

56:51.888 --> 56:55.141
Do you see any fresh kill?

56:55.167 --> 56:57.418
Shut up, Ty.

56:57.561 --> 56:59.760
How about a Freddie or Jason?

56:59.786 --> 57:01.832
Leave her alone, man.

57:01.981 --> 57:08.269
lt's bad enough getting rained out without having to hold her hand.

57:08.446 --> 57:10.971
Don't be an asshole about it.

57:10.997 --> 57:14.390
lt's okay.
 He doesn't believe me.

57:14.535 --> 57:15.983
lt's his right.

57:16.009 --> 57:17.720
Maybe l am crazy.

57:17.746 --> 57:20.929
Nobody thinks you're crazy.

57:21.082 --> 57:24.369
- l do.
- Why don't you go do something?

57:24.587 --> 57:26.794
l don't want to do nothing with him.

57:26.820 --> 57:28.904
l want to do something with you.

57:30.299 --> 57:34.698
Let's go to the gym and work off some stress.

57:34.724 --> 57:36.444
You're not crazy.

57:42.227 --> 57:48.597
Look, we need to find stoner boy and get pool sticks or something ...

57:48.775 --> 57:52.820
The greenhouse effect has caused the Gulf Stream to shift.

57:52.988 --> 58:00.567
Experts expect a dramatic increase of hurricanes, coastal flooding ...

58:00.786 --> 58:04.404
lt wouldn't take much to wipe us off this island.

58:04.581 --> 58:07.286
Shut up, okay? Shut up.

58:07.459 --> 58:10.710
God!

58:12.339 --> 58:15.089
Come on!

58:18.261 --> 58:21.263
This is a nice gym.

58:26.602 --> 58:28.760
Nice move.

58:28.938 --> 58:33.267
l'm gonna give your fisherman some of this and see how he likes it.

59:00.008 --> 59:03.591
Oh, poor baby.

59:03.762 --> 59:04.996
You know what?

59:05.022 --> 59:06.871
l got a better idea.

59:07.015 --> 59:10.181
You're not leaving this island till you get a tan.

59:13.980 --> 59:15.982
Wow. Cancer in a box.

59:16.008 --> 59:18.962
No, this is the safe sun.

59:19.109 --> 59:22.312
lt's better than a day on the beach, girl.

59:25.157 --> 59:29.404
With a little photosynthesis you'll feel like a new ...

59:29.578 --> 59:30.965
House plant?

59:30.991 --> 59:33.185
Exactly. Bye.

There's his cart.

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:21.700

01:01:02.707 --> 01:01:03.549
Damn.

01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:06.942
How many pairs are in there?

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:23.265
Hey, pool boy!

01:01:24.143 --> 01:01:26.979
Yo, Bob Marley!

01:01:27.147 --> 01:01:30.099
You in there or what?

01:02:03.388 --> 01:02:06.224
Karla?

01:02:09.728 --> 01:02:12.812
Karla?

01:02:40.047 --> 01:02:42.752
Come on!

01:02:55.812 --> 01:02:58.018
Tyrell!

01:02:59.107 --> 01:03:01.859
You guys, help me!

01:03:08.032 --> 01:03:10.357
Use this. 
Just smash it.

01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:17.871
Come on.

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:21.131
l told you l'm not crazy.
He's here.

01:03:21.157 --> 01:03:23.611
We've got to call for help.

01:03:23.754 --> 01:03:27.800
Man, this classifies as a fucking emergency!

01:03:33.765 --> 01:03:34.932
Hey, Brooks.

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:37.170
Where the fuck you at?

01:03:37.196 --> 01:03:40.504
We want off this fucking island.

01:03:40.646 --> 01:03:41.545
Oh, shit.

01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:45.167
We've got to get the fuck out.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.576
Julie!

01:04:04.668 --> 01:04:06.696
Where are the boats?

01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:09.354
They were cut loose.

01:04:09.506 --> 01:04:12.337
Julie, what the fuck is going on?

01:04:12.363 --> 01:04:15.450
He's gonna kill us one by one.

01:04:15.595 --> 01:04:19.758
- Who?
- Ben Willis.

01:04:19.932 --> 01:04:22.740
Willis is dead. You killed him.

01:04:22.766 --> 01:04:25.663
They never found the body.

01:04:25.813 --> 01:04:32.526
We lied. We hit him with our car and threw his body in the water.

01:04:32.694 --> 01:04:33.931
Only he didn't die.

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:37.013
Last Fourth of July he killed Barry and Helen.

01:04:37.157 --> 01:04:40.740
l thought Ray and l killed him, but we didn't.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:42.617
He's back to finish it off!

01:04:42.643 --> 01:04:44.980
We're in the middle of nowhere.

01:04:45.164 --> 01:04:49.791
There's dead bodies piling up and there's only one guy missing.

01:04:49.961 --> 01:04:51.934
The porter.
What's his name?

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.778
Estes. The fucker knows something.

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:59.632
We can sit here like assholes or go find him first.

01:04:59.803 --> 01:05:01.037
lt's not him.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.909
We have to do something.

01:05:05.642 --> 01:05:08.476
l'm with him.

01:05:09.437 --> 01:05:12.391
Come on.

01:05:12.565 --> 01:05:15.520
How can you not tell me the whole story?

01:05:15.546 --> 01:05:17.169
l'm your best friend!

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.956
l didn't want to involve anybody.

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:23.098
Well, it's too late for that now.

01:05:24.284 --> 01:05:27.986
Come on, let's go!

01:06:22.548 --> 01:06:24.258
Hey, Estes.
 You sick bastard, are you in here?

01:06:24.258 --> 01:06:25.384
Hey, Estes.

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:28.991
You sick bastard, are you in here?

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:31.826
You hear me?

01:06:31.852 --> 01:06:34.325
Sick mother ...

01:06:35.769 --> 01:06:37.366
He's not here, man.

01:06:37.392 --> 01:06:40.584
There's some crazy shit in here.

01:06:47.571 --> 01:06:48.864
No doubt.

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:53.052
This is our fucking killer.

01:06:53.201 --> 01:06:56.736
This is our fucking guy.

01:07:20.977 --> 01:07:23.349
You guys.

01:07:31.028 --> 01:07:33.698
Shit.

01:07:35.073 --> 01:07:38.073
Fuck.

01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:45.192
Anyone missing a hair tie?

01:07:45.218 --> 01:07:46.856
Shit. That's mine.

01:07:49.712 --> 01:07:52.998
What about a toothbrush?

01:08:00.389 --> 01:08:03.721
Voodoo.

01:08:03.891 --> 01:08:09.764
We need flashlights, guns, whatever we need to get off this island.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.354
What if he's down there?

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.800
Let's just get the fuck out.

01:08:17.238 --> 01:08:19.031
You wait here.

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:22.256
lt's safer up here.

01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:26.323
l'll just be a second.

01:08:44.514 --> 01:08:47.845
Julie, where are you going?

01:08:56.274 --> 01:08:58.764
What the hell was that?

01:08:58.943 --> 01:09:00.850
Shit.

01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:03.546
Julie?

01:09:35.395 --> 01:09:40.733
- Brazilia.
- Julie, watch out!

01:09:42.693 --> 01:09:47.438
That's the capital of Brazil.
Not Rio.

01:09:50.617 --> 01:09:55.077
No, guys! Leave him alone!

01:09:55.288 --> 01:09:56.810
This is the killer.

01:09:56.836 --> 01:09:59.560
We've seen the voodoo stuff.

01:09:59.709 --> 01:10:02.301
l found the bodies this morning.

01:10:02.327 --> 01:10:05.403
l tried the radio, it was destroyed.

01:10:05.547 --> 01:10:06.847
Leave him alone.

01:10:06.873 --> 01:10:08.064
l believe him.

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.364
l haven't hurt anyone.

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:14.722
l stole those things to protect you.

01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:17.908
He could have killed me, but didn't.

01:10:17.934 --> 01:10:21.118
We didn't answer the question right.

01:10:21.312 --> 01:10:23.480
This whole thing was a set-up.

01:10:23.506 --> 01:10:25.964
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil.

01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:28.523
Sorry. We lose.

01:10:28.695 --> 01:10:31.069
So where's this Ben Willis guy?

01:10:31.095 --> 01:10:32.550
l don't know.

01:10:32.697 --> 01:10:34.097
You never know.

01:10:34.123 --> 01:10:38.975
How do we know you didn't set this whole thing up?

01:10:39.163 --> 01:10:41.278
How do we know you didn't?

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:44.394
l know who you're talking about.

01:10:46.127 --> 01:10:48.451
He used to work here.

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:51.831
l've seen him by the orchard.

01:10:51.857 --> 01:10:53.592
l'll show you.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:56.516
He could be setting us up.

01:10:56.542 --> 01:10:59.448
l'm not staying here.

01:10:59.598 --> 01:11:01.502
We're better off in the open.

01:11:01.528 --> 01:11:04.285
Maybe we can kill this asshole for good.

01:11:06.521 --> 01:11:09.143
Show us.

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:30.033
What the hell ..?

01:11:31.252 --> 01:11:33.787
l need to get to Tower Bay lsland.

01:11:33.813 --> 01:11:35.228
We're closed.

01:11:35.382 --> 01:11:38.086
l need to get to that island now.

01:11:38.259 --> 01:11:44.427
Let me ask you, did you happen to see what it's like outside?

01:11:44.598 --> 01:11:48.542
l'm not looking for a weather report.

01:11:48.568 --> 01:11:51.125
So which boat is yours?

01:11:51.272 --> 01:11:54.687
He worked here for many years.

01:11:54.858 --> 01:11:56.808
Raised a family.

01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:58.417
Pretty wife.

01:11:58.569 --> 01:12:00.038
Two little ones.

01:12:00.064 --> 01:12:01.715
A boy and a girl.

01:12:01.865 --> 01:12:04.949
One day the wife went missing.

01:12:05.118 --> 01:12:10.360
The maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite. 201 .

01:12:10.581 --> 01:12:13.143
Eventually they found the body.

01:12:13.169 --> 01:12:15.232
Pieces of it, at least.

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:18.455
People say she was cheating on him.

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:20.902
People say he would beat her.

01:12:20.928 --> 01:12:23.198
People say a lot of things.

01:12:23.343 --> 01:12:25.947
He disappeared.

01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:28.575
Children, too.

01:12:28.723 --> 01:12:30.703
Now he's back.

01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:34.122
Julie, be careful.

01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:37.768
l've got to see.

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:06.638
What's today's date?

01:13:06.664 --> 01:13:09.109
July fourth.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:18.747
l'm not gonna die on this island.

01:13:18.773 --> 01:13:20.477
Do you hear me?

01:13:20.503 --> 01:13:22.321
l'm right here.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.121
But my grave stays empty!

01:13:25.147 --> 01:13:27.292
This is crazy.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:30.390
No phones, no boats, no way out.

01:13:30.416 --> 01:13:32.808
Yeah?
Then we fight.

01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:34.340
Where did Estes go?

01:13:34.366 --> 01:13:36.848
Why? He can't help us anyway.

01:13:36.995 --> 01:13:38.232
Only he can.

01:13:38.258 --> 01:13:39.778
l'll find him.

01:13:39.804 --> 01:13:43.307
Are you gonna leave us here?

01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:46.352
lt's okay.
He can't have gone far.

01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:49.564
Meet us back at the hotel, okay?

01:13:49.715 --> 01:13:50.669
Okay?

01:13:50.695 --> 01:13:54.319
Come on, let's go.

01:14:21.037 --> 01:14:24.372
What l need is a gun, not a knife.

01:14:24.398 --> 01:14:25.770
But fuck it.

01:14:27.959 --> 01:14:30.113
What are you gonna do with those?

01:14:30.139 --> 01:14:30.986
Butter him?

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:33.607
Clean vegetables?

01:14:33.633 --> 01:14:35.234
Take this.

01:14:36.884 --> 01:14:40.253
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:14:43.058 --> 01:14:46.971
Shit ... Hey, are you okay?

01:14:47.144 --> 01:14:50.145
We're gonna get this fucker, right?

01:14:50.314 --> 01:14:53.018
Right?
 Let's head to the pantry.

01:14:53.044 --> 01:14:56.423
Why?
ls that a good place to hide?

01:14:56.569 --> 01:14:57.763
l don't know.

01:14:57.789 --> 01:15:00.177
l'm just fucking hungry.

01:15:01.783 --> 01:15:04.164
Estes, where did you go?

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:07.561
You said you were gonna help us.

01:15:10.124 --> 01:15:14.999
You should have told us you had a boat.

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:19.499
- We're not going anywhere.
- What?

01:15:29.935 --> 01:15:31.666
Baby, don't go in here.

01:15:31.692 --> 01:15:33.021
lt's only food.

01:15:33.047 --> 01:15:34.729
Don't worry, baby.

01:15:41.111 --> 01:15:46.567
Stop trying to act like you ain't hungry.

01:16:15.268 --> 01:16:18.553
lt's just a stupid rat.

01:16:18.729 --> 01:16:21.933
No, Nancy!

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:42.163
Come in.
Come in!

01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:44.482
Come on ...

01:16:45.714 --> 01:16:49.960
The Arcadian requests emergency assistance for Tower Bay lsland.

01:16:50.176 --> 01:16:54.837
l repeat, this is the Arcadian requesting emergency assistance.

01:17:04.815 --> 01:17:08.942
So that's where the flashlights were.

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:11.657
Sorry, but it could have been you.

01:17:11.683 --> 01:17:13.928
Or you, you crazy bitch.

01:17:14.074 --> 01:17:16.428
You broke into my hiding place.

01:17:16.454 --> 01:17:18.807
Sorry, l missed the sign.

01:17:18.953 --> 01:17:23.994
This place didn't have a murder rate till you people showed up.

01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:31.352
l never saw a dead body before.

01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:33.533
Get used to it.

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:35.442
Who's doing this?

01:17:35.468 --> 01:17:37.193
Here we go.

01:17:37.388 --> 01:17:39.092
Don't get her started.

01:17:39.118 --> 01:17:42.915
lt's a long, fucked-up story you won't believe.

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:46.923
This is the worst vacation in my life.

01:17:46.949 --> 01:17:49.999
l'm tired, hungry and horny.

01:17:50.148 --> 01:17:55.024
And personally, l haven't seen one goddamn psycho killer.

01:18:08.208 --> 01:18:12.195
Come on!
l know where we can hide.

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:13.391
Come on!

01:18:32.105 --> 01:18:35.190
Karla, come on!

01:18:50.914 --> 01:18:54.247
Karla!

01:18:57.503 --> 01:19:00.457
Shit ... lt won't lock!

01:19:04.135 --> 01:19:07.633
Follow me.
 Stay on the beams.

01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:20.650
Jesus Christ, that's my bedroom.

01:19:30.493 --> 01:19:33.659
Come on, give me your hand.
Come on!

01:19:33.829 --> 01:19:37.826
Come on ... Come on!

01:19:40.794 --> 01:19:44.293
You sick freak!

01:19:44.506 --> 01:19:47.340
Come on!

01:19:53.056 --> 01:19:56.472
Karla!

01:20:02.106 --> 01:20:04.560
Karla!

01:20:04.732 --> 01:20:08.103
Shit, shit ...

01:20:20.039 --> 01:20:21.979
We've got to do something.

01:20:22.005 --> 01:20:24.690
She'll never make it.
 Come on.

01:20:24.877 --> 01:20:27.332
Get off me!

01:20:27.504 --> 01:20:29.877
Oh, shit.

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:37.177
Oh, shit.

01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:12.057
Damn, it's locked.

01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:14.977
Are you okay?

01:22:15.003 --> 01:22:16.779
l'll live.

01:22:16.805 --> 01:22:19.113
lt's locked.

01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:20.866
We've got to open the door.

01:22:20.892 --> 01:22:23.008
We'll get you out.
 l promise.

01:22:28.867 --> 01:22:32.284
Karla!

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:39.785
Shit ... Come on, Nancy.

01:22:50.013 --> 01:22:53.013
Come on, open the door.

01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:56.595
l can't find it.

01:22:56.621 --> 01:22:59.998
Get out of the way.

01:23:01.356 --> 01:23:05.105
Get out of the way!

01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:14.323
Karla, come on!

01:23:27.047 --> 01:23:29.291
Where are we going?

01:23:29.317 --> 01:23:32.149
The storm shelter!

01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:42.678
Don't worry.

01:23:42.704 --> 01:23:46.670
l know there's emergency power here somewhere.

01:23:47.899 --> 01:23:52.027
- Hey, Julie?
- Just grab hold of my hand.

01:23:52.237 --> 01:23:54.480
Just grab hold of my hand.

01:23:54.506 --> 01:23:57.008
l am holding your hand.

01:23:58.911 --> 01:24:02.195
No, you're not.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:23.431
- Are you okay?
- lt's Will!

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.160
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:24:27.186 --> 01:24:28.334
Come on.

01:24:34.193 --> 01:24:36.294
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.588
Just get inside.

01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:39.119
Estes attacked me.

01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:41.651
You think he's a part of this?

01:24:41.677 --> 01:24:42.902
l don't know.

01:24:42.928 --> 01:24:44.622
Let's get inside.

01:24:44.786 --> 01:24:47.714
l don't think we should go inside.

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:51.099
The slicker guy was on the beach.

01:25:00.801 --> 01:25:02.568
Jesus, you're bleeding to death.

01:25:02.594 --> 01:25:04.030
We need a first-aid kit.

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:06.673
l think there's one in the lobby.

01:25:06.699 --> 01:25:09.115
All right, just sit there.

01:25:09.309 --> 01:25:10.537
Don't worry.

01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:12.584
He's gone.
 Just go.

01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:15.241
Look, l'll go with you.

01:25:15.267 --> 01:25:16.525
 Come on.

01:25:18.319 --> 01:25:20.809
Listen, Will.
 You're gonna be okay.

01:25:20.987 --> 01:25:24.652
Jesus, there's blood everywhere.

01:25:27.451 --> 01:25:29.693
l can't find a wound.

01:25:29.871 --> 01:25:34.199
That's because it's not my blood.

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:38.702
What?

01:25:39.588 --> 01:25:43.716
lt's not my blood, Julie.

01:25:59.148 --> 01:26:03.359
What's your favourite radio station?

01:26:07.946 --> 01:26:12.113
What's your favourite radio station?

01:26:12.139 --> 01:26:13.180
96.7.

01:26:13.328 --> 01:26:17.491
lt's time for you to contemplate the ultimate getaway.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.468
Here, take that.
Come on ...

01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:42.686
Estes ...

01:26:43.439 --> 01:26:46.060
Fuck.

01:26:49.069 --> 01:26:51.062
Get off me!

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:54.156
Get up ...

01:26:55.366 --> 01:26:59.115
God, no!

01:27:22.101 --> 01:27:25.884
We finally get to spend some quality time together.

01:27:26.063 --> 01:27:28.029
Why are you doing this to me?

01:27:28.055 --> 01:27:29.954
lt's always about you.

01:27:30.107 --> 01:27:31.647
"l have bad dreams.

01:27:31.673 --> 01:27:32.862
l can't sleep.

01:27:32.888 --> 01:27:35.803
l have trouble with my boyfriend."

01:27:35.947 --> 01:27:40.883
You never take responsibility for anything you do.

01:27:40.909 --> 01:27:42.554
Not even murder.

01:27:46.707 --> 01:27:49.509
What did you do that for?

01:27:49.535 --> 01:27:51.439
You're a bitch.

01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:57.074
That's gonna leave a mark.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.109
Tell me why.

01:27:59.261 --> 01:28:02.098
Come on, think.
You'll get it.

01:28:02.124 --> 01:28:03.448
Will Benson.

01:28:05.808 --> 01:28:09.094
Ben's son.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:13.012
Hi, Dad.

01:28:23.491 --> 01:28:26.466
Hush, now.
No more screaming.

01:28:26.492 --> 01:28:28.229
No more running.

01:28:28.255 --> 01:28:30.208
lt's time to die.

01:28:30.331 --> 01:28:34.542
Let her go ... Let her go.

01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:37.828
You've got to be shitting me!

01:28:38.003 --> 01:28:39.941
What will you do?

01:28:39.967 --> 01:28:41.650
Call us names?

01:28:41.676 --> 01:28:44.068
Let her go now!

01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:45.809
Think about it, boy.

01:28:45.835 --> 01:28:47.270
You're no killer.

01:28:47.296 --> 01:28:48.561
That's my job.

01:28:51.767 --> 01:28:55.813
You don't have it in you.

01:29:28.093 --> 01:29:31.153
Sure did miss you down here, Ray.

01:29:31.179 --> 01:29:34.701
Too bad. We could have been friends.

01:29:34.849 --> 01:29:36.233
Really, man.

01:29:36.259 --> 01:29:40.295
l would have shared her with you.

01:29:45.234 --> 01:29:46.327
Come on, Ray.

01:29:46.353 --> 01:29:47.507
Stay with me.

01:29:47.533 --> 01:29:48.794
You see that?

01:29:48.946 --> 01:29:53.773
l want you to think about all the things we're gonna do to her.

01:29:57.079 --> 01:29:58.659
You want him, Dad?

01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:00.354
Stand him up.

This is the Coast Guard.

01:31:45.366 --> 01:31:47.077
Remain where you are.

01:31:47.223 --> 01:31:51.471
The rescue team wiII be with you shortIy.

01:31:52.187 --> 01:31:54.511
Julie ...

01:31:58.859 --> 01:32:03.651
Karla ... God, l thought l would never see you again.

01:32:03.822 --> 01:32:06.709
Girl, you don't have to worry about me.

01:32:06.735 --> 01:32:08.141
l'm made of steel.

01:32:12.289 --> 01:32:14.329
Good old Ray.

01:32:14.355 --> 01:32:17.022
Hey, Karla.

01:32:20.838 --> 01:32:25.298
lf anyone asks, let's not tell them it rained the whole time.

01:32:26.844 --> 01:32:30.842
- lt'll be our little secret.
- Yeah.

01:33:14.054 --> 01:33:16.747
l almost fell asleep on the couch.

01:33:16.773 --> 01:33:19.702
You didn't tell me how late it was.

01:33:21.645 --> 01:33:23.385
Were you checking the locks again?

01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:24.791
You know me too well.

01:33:26.608 --> 01:33:30.735
Don't you dare go to sleep, girl.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.491
l love this thing.

01:35:24.384 --> 01:35:29.097
