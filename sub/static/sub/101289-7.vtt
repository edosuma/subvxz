00:08.133 --> 00:10.844
[gun blasts]

00:15.807 --> 00:17.100
-[gun blast]
-[Sterling] Ooh!

00:17.183 --> 00:18.560
I got him in the nostril!

00:18.643 --> 00:21.062
Wow, you look just like Mom right now.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.398
With my hair pulled back?
I totally thought that this morning.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.859
No, I mean adeptly handling
a deadly weapon.

00:25.942 --> 00:26.776
[gun blast]

00:26.860 --> 00:29.571
By the way, who do you think
she's going to shoot

00:29.654 --> 00:32.240
with her secret gun
from her secret storage unit?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.367
-Blair...
-[gun blast]

00:34.451 --> 00:36.828
...I know you saw something
that you thought felt weird, but--

00:36.911 --> 00:39.164
Oh, my God!
That's extremely condescending.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.042
Mom isn't a criminal mastermind, okay?
She hates crime.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.461
Remember when she made you return
that MoonPie

00:44.544 --> 00:45.795
that you stole from Piggly Wiggly

00:45.879 --> 00:47.589
when we were driving
to Seaside in the fourth grade?

00:47.672 --> 00:49.591
It was a Goo Goo Cluster
from Harris Teeter

00:49.674 --> 00:52.135
when we were driving back
from Seaside in the third grade.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.596
You're saying you won't even consider
the possibility

00:54.679 --> 00:56.389
that she's lying to us at least?

00:56.473 --> 00:59.267
Fine. If you make this bullseye,
dead center,

00:59.350 --> 01:00.935
then I will consider the possibility

01:01.019 --> 01:03.980
that Mom is leading some
dangerous double life.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.315
-Really?
-Really.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.192
[distant man chattering]

01:21.790 --> 01:23.124
[gasps]

01:23.792 --> 01:25.126
-I got him in the nuts!
-Doesn't count.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.045
I totally got him in the nuts.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.213
-It doesn't count.
-That totally counts.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.714
We didn't say nothing about nuts.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.549
Well, it's a bullseye of some sort.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.010
-[theme music]
-Bullseye.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.387
[vocalizing]

01:52.946 --> 01:54.405
[Blair] I've landed on a theory.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.949
She's a part of the Dixie Mafia.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.952
While we're at school,
she drives to Biloxi, Mississippi

01:59.035 --> 01:59.953
and then on the weekends,

02:00.036 --> 02:03.915
she serves up premium hardcore drugs
to the Atlanta upper-crust

02:03.998 --> 02:06.209
through tennis matches,
book club, church...

02:07.252 --> 02:09.129
Come on, don't you think
it's even a little bit suspicious?

02:09.212 --> 02:10.588
What? Mom having a gun?

02:10.672 --> 02:11.840
No. Want to know why?

02:12.257 --> 02:14.467
Because we're holding guns
right now, Blair.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.593
We're gun owners.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.680
Dad is a gun owner.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.307
Mom says, that guns
are a product of the Fall.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.978
[grunts] There's no reason for her
to have a gun or a pile of cash,

02:25.061 --> 02:26.855
just like there's no reason
for her to have a storage unit.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.232
Maybe that's where she put
our Madame Alexander dolls.

02:30.066 --> 02:30.900
And the gun?

02:31.693 --> 02:32.902
To protect the dolls.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.070
[cell phone dings]

02:34.154 --> 02:35.321
[cell phone bleeps]

02:37.407 --> 02:39.159
You need to take this seriously.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.787
Blair, you are like a dog
with a bone, okay?

02:42.871 --> 02:43.997
It's either sex, sex, sex

02:44.080 --> 02:48.084
or some implausible theory
about Mom and her criminal second life.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.086
Okay, you're doing it again.
You're stirring things up.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.254
No, I'm not.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.214
Stop minimizing my experiences.

02:54.007 --> 02:54.883
Sorry.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.136
Hey.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.846
I'm sorry again that you didn't

02:59.929 --> 03:02.182
get to put the "O" in your column
at the debate tournament.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.143
I really thought that one of those guys
was going to get you there.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.686
Yeah, that's okay. Uh...

03:06.769 --> 03:08.479
I'm sure I'll have an orgasm one day.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.274
I'll sit on a bicycle seat or something.
It's fine.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.400
Of course, you will.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.153
It just takes some women
a lot of time to figure it out.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.113
You just have to find out
what makes you tick.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.574
Inside your vagina.

03:20.909 --> 03:21.784
[gasps]

03:21.868 --> 03:23.703
[gasps ecstatically]

03:23.786 --> 03:24.704
Mm-hm.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.540
Uh, can we talk
about something else, like, um...

03:29.167 --> 03:30.335
Mom and the gun?

03:30.418 --> 03:32.128
-[gasps] Really?
-Yeah.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.796
Okay, so this is what I'm thinking.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.382
We can go to the storage unit,
but it's locked.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.426
-So we've gotta crack the lock and--
-Anyway...

03:38.509 --> 03:41.804
Anyway, uh...

03:41.888 --> 03:43.223
-Hey, Dad.
-Hello!

03:43.306 --> 03:46.226
How are you enjoying
this season of  The Masked Singer?

03:46.309 --> 03:47.518
I've been meaning to ask you.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.314
Oh, my goodness, that show does not miss.
[chuckles]

03:51.397 --> 03:53.483
I never would have thought
that cricket was Roberta Flack.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.363
Hey, um, have you seen April?

03:59.405 --> 04:01.866
No. She went AWOL
since the debate tournament.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.161
Your ex is looking bereft.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.792
Hi, Luke. How's, um... everything?

04:11.709 --> 04:12.585
Great.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.254
Amazing.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.215
-Mm.
-Um, I'm taking time for myself.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.550
That's really good.
I'm really glad to hear that.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.220
And I have my music,

04:22.762 --> 04:25.265
and my bandmates take turns
reminding me to eat...

04:26.140 --> 04:27.016
which rocks.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.435
Luke! Come sit by me.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.939
[school bell rings]

04:40.822 --> 04:41.698
Hi!

04:44.742 --> 04:45.660
[sighs]

04:45.743 --> 04:46.953
How's your morning been?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.789
Those announcements were so loud,
my ears were like...

04:50.290 --> 04:51.666
Yeah. [clears throat]

04:51.749 --> 04:52.875
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.752
Um, I don't know what you're doing,

04:54.836 --> 04:57.630
but I would keep my fingers
out of that mousetrap.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.548
Oh.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.175
She's best to be avoided
when she's in a biting mood.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.218
She bit you?

05:02.844 --> 05:03.845
What? No.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.305
What's going on with her?

05:05.763 --> 05:07.849
She's... um...

05:07.932 --> 05:10.977
struggling to keep it all together,
but it's personal, so...

05:11.060 --> 05:13.479
Yeah, it's her dad. 
His trial started today.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.148
-It's personal!
-Right.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.443
And her dad's a person, Ezequiel.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.154
That must be really hard for her.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.573
Yeah, but we have to look out
for ourselves.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.408
In an autocracy, when the despot is down,

05:25.491 --> 05:27.118
it's every person for herself.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.703
-Zirself.
-Zirself.

05:28.786 --> 05:29.871
[Ellen] Okay, guys and gals.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.290
Now listen, I don't want anyone to revolt

05:32.373 --> 05:34.542
'cause I know you're all
excited for your long weekend,

05:34.625 --> 05:38.421
but I have an itsy-bitsy,
teeny-weeny little assignment.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.173
I did it myself back in the day

05:40.256 --> 05:43.009
and I had so much fun. Oh!

05:43.092 --> 05:45.219
Okay, it is time for...

05:47.096 --> 05:48.473
Biblical Buildings.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.807
[all groaning]

05:49.891 --> 05:55.396
Yes, I know! You each get to pick
an architectural structure from the Bible,

05:55.480 --> 05:59.192
and then build a historically
accurate representation

05:59.275 --> 06:00.735
to present to the class.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.779
It's a chance to just dig in

06:02.862 --> 06:06.699
and get your hands dirty
in that rich biblical soil, huh?

06:06.783 --> 06:09.243
And who says our school
doesn't teach the Arts?

06:09.327 --> 06:12.205
[mimics flatulence]
Okay. So, let's just pair off

06:12.288 --> 06:14.540
and then everybody
yell out who wants what.

06:14.832 --> 06:15.792
Can I do the manger?

06:16.084 --> 06:19.629
Uh, that's a kind of building,
I guess. Yeah.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.964
Moses' door with blood on the frame,

06:22.048 --> 06:23.508
like, dripping down, really violent.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.885
Well, it should really
be the whole building, Franklin.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.678
Luke and I want Noah's Ark.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.598
Each animal... matched with a mate...

06:31.224 --> 06:32.767
propagating the species.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.394
[chuckles]

06:34.477 --> 06:37.897
Yeah. Yeah, and I bet
some animals paired off and...

06:37.980 --> 06:41.025
weren't the exact same person,
like an octopus and a Sterl--

06:41.109 --> 06:41.984
A squirrel!

06:42.068 --> 06:42.985
Um...

06:43.069 --> 06:45.613
A squirrel. I think that
sounds like a beautiful idea.

06:45.696 --> 06:46.781
I'm very excited.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.658
Okay.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
Solomon’s Temple.

06:50.076 --> 06:50.993
[students gasp]

06:52.203 --> 06:55.373
That's insanity. Why do you always gotta
try so hard, April?

06:55.456 --> 06:56.791
[Ellen] Oh, Franklin!

06:56.874 --> 06:58.668
Do we need to speak privately?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.129
No, Miss Johnson.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.797
[Ellen] Solomon's Temple. That...

07:02.880 --> 07:04.924
hmm... is ambitious, April,

07:06.134 --> 07:08.428
but I like it and I like you.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.473
We're going to need gold paint,
chicken wire and spackle.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.267
Also blood, I think it should be real.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.227
You're gonna have to kill a pigeon.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.187
[students chattering]

07:18.271 --> 07:19.939
Why aren't you writing this down?

07:20.022 --> 07:21.190
Um...

07:21.274 --> 07:23.651
Hannah B and I are actually partners.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.070
-Sorry.
-Sorry, it just happened.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.282
But, like, before you asked. S-- So...

07:30.867 --> 07:34.454
-Oh-oh, you've got a Dorito in your hair.
-It's right here.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.371
Yeah.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.998
It's kind of gross, yeah.

07:38.249 --> 07:42.795
Fine. But you should build
a biblical time machine back to now

07:42.879 --> 07:45.590
because partnering with Hannah B
is a huge mistake.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.050
She cites Wikipedia in her bibliographies.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.720
She's never even registered her JSTOR
and EBSCO Host logins.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.180
We choose the cross.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.017
It's technically a building
Jesus lived on until he died.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.352
[Ellen] Okay, let's think on that.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.312
Um...

07:59.395 --> 08:01.105
I'll do Solomon's Temple with you.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.524
I know all the dimensions
from Miss Kline's Sunday school class.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.568
Uh, "Five cubits in height
and ten cubits brim to brim."

08:05.651 --> 08:07.904
I know the dimensions, too.
I'm not an animal.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.947
Oh, you know,
of course you're not an animal,

08:10.031 --> 08:10.948
Oh, my gosh.

08:11.032 --> 08:11.949
Um, but--

08:12.033 --> 08:13.784
Ooh ooh, my dad has this woodworking shop,

08:13.868 --> 08:15.244
and he paints these little wooden ducks.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.163
It's so weird, but he's got

08:17.246 --> 08:21.417
a mi-- a miter saw,
and a nail gun and drills.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.752
-It will be so fun--
-Fine.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.672
Okay... um, tomorrow maybe?

08:26.756 --> 08:29.634
-If you aren't busy, because--
-I said fine.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.010
Okay.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.179
[pop music playing]

08:33.679 --> 08:36.265
[Sterling, mimicking Bowser]
"Get in there! Why is paper so heavy?"

08:36.349 --> 08:37.892
[Blair] "Stupid piece of plastic."

08:39.894 --> 08:43.814
[Sterling, in British accent] "Oh, hello.
I'm a lady dressed like a napkin."

08:43.898 --> 08:45.816
"Are you from the Napkin Department?"

08:46.359 --> 08:47.777
"Hey there, pretty lady."

08:48.152 --> 08:49.904
"Do you have any yogurt?"

08:50.154 --> 08:51.405
[Blair] "You know you want it."

08:54.075 --> 08:55.535
Does Bowser have friends?

08:56.118 --> 08:57.870
No. We're it.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.665
[Sterling] They're still hugging.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.874
[Blair] This is pornographic.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.212
[Sterling] Why is she rubbing his arms?

09:06.295 --> 09:08.089
Is he backing away?
Should we go and save him?

09:08.339 --> 09:11.050
Wait. Yolanda knows her, too?

09:13.928 --> 09:15.054
Is that his ex?

09:15.721 --> 09:16.806
[gasps]

09:16.889 --> 09:20.810
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:21.811 --> 09:25.189
-[gaps] They're looking at us.
-They're coming inside. What do we say?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.692
-Hello?
-Hello. Yeah, that's good. Hello.

09:27.775 --> 09:28.985
Okay, great. We're saying hello.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.778
-Classic, adult, neutral.
-Be normal!

09:31.237 --> 09:32.655
Greetings, earthlings.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.573
Bonjour!

09:33.656 --> 09:34.615
Hola!

09:34.699 --> 09:36.826
You must be Bowser's... boo.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.703
-Ex-boo.
-Uh, hey!

09:39.078 --> 09:41.163
Don't be... you.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.333
And you must be the little  gringas
Yolanda told me about,

09:44.417 --> 09:47.628
bringing in new life
and lighting up B's fourth chakra.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.714
[chuckles lightly] Mmm.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.424
Oh, my God.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.427
Your soul is settled.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.511
I can feel it.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.762
I'm actually a pretty nervous person.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.974
And you... You...

10:00.057 --> 10:01.225
[inhales deeply]

10:04.437 --> 10:05.855
-Mmm.
-Okay, cool.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.940
How about we get to work here?

10:08.024 --> 10:09.400
Yolanda, you got a skip?

10:09.483 --> 10:10.651
That's why I'm here.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.361
Oh, you know, you go.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.946
I'll stop by for dinner.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.032
Oh, I've been dying to make my goulash.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.327
I'm assuming you have pots,
pans, homemade beef broth,

10:19.410 --> 10:21.329
noodle... No?

10:21.412 --> 10:22.288
No.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.582
You know what? [clicks teeth]
We'll figure it out.

10:25.791 --> 10:26.626
Ciao-ee.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.211
[gasps]

10:29.295 --> 10:31.047
-Oh, my God.
-What is she doing here?

10:31.130 --> 10:33.215
Looking for a potential producer
for her new album.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.092
She's a singer?
I thought she owned a goat farm.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.010
Exactly.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.012
-Did you know she was coming?
-[Bowser] Yeah.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.430
Are you gonna get back together with her?

10:39.513 --> 10:42.266
No! Not that it's any business of yours.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.726
Nice plants, by the way.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.853
-I give it a day and a half.
-Till they're banging?

10:45.936 --> 10:48.022
-Yeah.
-No. Nope.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.316
-Why?
-She needs Bowser to fund that album.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.276
That is not how it is.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.236
-She was touching you a lot.
-Mm-hm.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.363
How do you know how it is?

10:55.446 --> 10:56.947
You haven't talked to her in...

10:57.740 --> 10:58.699
Oh.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.743
Mm.
She liked that Instagram post of yours.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.119
[gasps] The picture I took?

11:02.203 --> 11:03.120
-Yes.
-Aww.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.747
And what? She sent you a message?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.333
Well, I saw that she liked it
and I sent her one. Okay?

11:07.958 --> 11:10.252
I'm allowed to keep in touch
with my ex-wife, you know.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.088
See, this is textbook Michelle.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.756
She sees an opening and she sweeps in

11:13.839 --> 11:15.883
with whatever new project
she's got going on.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.593
A yoga studio on a boat,

11:18.052 --> 11:20.221
a marathon across Antarctica, oh,

11:20.304 --> 11:22.223
"Oh, I know, let's clone ourselves."

11:22.682 --> 11:24.725
And then she sweeps away just as easily

11:24.809 --> 11:26.268
and Bowser here is left holding the bill

11:26.352 --> 11:28.688
or his own genetic matter,
depending on the year.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.940
On, off, off, on.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.109
I figured it'd end after the divorce,

11:33.192 --> 11:34.985
but old habits die hard, I guess.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.864
Huh. So, you're, like, addicted to her.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.991
And she uses him like an old rag.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.453
Well if he's the addict, then he uses her.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.330
But she's using him clearly,

11:46.414 --> 11:48.457
so he can't be the addict. He's the drug.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.875
And she's the addict?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.086
Well, she's addicted
to him being addicted to her.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.588
-So they're both addicts then?
-It's called codependence.

11:54.672 --> 11:55.589
I'm not addicted!

11:59.135 --> 12:00.970
Jesus, somebody shoot me.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.012
Do you have a skip or not?

12:04.056 --> 12:04.932
Thank you.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.100
How hard was that?

12:06.684 --> 12:07.643
His name's Gary Durbin.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.730
Gary skipped bail three weeks ago.
He's currently MIA.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.065
-What was he booked for?
-Dealing amphetamines.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.152
-His old lady drives a 18-wheeler, hm?
-Mm-hm.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.528
Travels with her sometimes.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.030
Probably hiding out
in the back of her semi right now.

12:20.781 --> 12:21.866
You call the truck company?

12:21.949 --> 12:23.409
-Get her route?
-Not yet.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.077
[sighs]

12:25.911 --> 12:26.787
I'll do it.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.373
You sure? Because I can call Pedro,

12:29.457 --> 12:30.875
-Rory, or Perry D--
-Yolanda.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.919
I said I got it, hm?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.172
Here, take this.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.716
Track her credit card statements
like I taught you.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.135
See if you can find out
if she's sticking to her route.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.094
Okay.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.183
I’m out sixty grand here, Bowser.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.018
Yolanda? Trust me.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.024
Maybe Mom's dealing amphetamines.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.401
What are amphetamines?

12:57.651 --> 12:59.612
Drugs that can go on land and water.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.030
Oh.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.157
Oh, I have to be honest, y'all,

13:03.240 --> 13:05.785
I was running around
so much today doing my errands,

13:05.868 --> 13:07.286
I had to go get a pre-made casserole.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.330
So, y'all be honest. [chuckles]

13:09.872 --> 13:11.999
Well, it tastes a little mealy,

13:12.458 --> 13:15.377
and there's something in there
I can't quite put my finger on,

13:15.461 --> 13:18.380
but beige would be the flavor I'd give it.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.133
Oh, well, maybe a little too honest.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.134
[chuckles]

13:22.218 --> 13:24.220
So, girls, are you all packed up

13:24.303 --> 13:27.223
and ready for your big hunting trip
with Uncle Deacon and Big Daddy?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.307
Why do you ask?

13:28.974 --> 13:30.017
Are you planning something?

13:30.100 --> 13:33.687
I'm not sure, maybe mimosas,
a little foot mask?

13:33.771 --> 13:35.648
Ooh, interesting.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.525
Where do you store those?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.694
Um, I actually have to stay behind.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.696
-What? Why?
-Well, that's a shame, Sterl.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.490
I've got this big project for Bible class

13:44.573 --> 13:45.991
and it's going to take all weekend.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.451
And we need to use your tools, too, Dad,

13:47.535 --> 13:48.828
-if that's okay.
-That's okay.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.747
-We?
-Yeah, they partnered me up with April.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.290
[groans] It's awful. I hate it.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.169
You can't bail.
We have to wring Dad for information.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.671
-Since when?
-Since I realized just now

13:58.754 --> 14:00.172
that this man cannot lie.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.966
[scoffs] Did you hear what he said
about the casserole?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.552
If he knows anything
about Mom and the gun,

14:04.635 --> 14:06.345
he will crack in five seconds flat.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.138
Let Mom be. It's okay to have a secret.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.641
-We don't have secrets.
-No, but we could if we wanted to, right?

14:10.724 --> 14:12.685
Right. Wait. No.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.978
I don't like secrets.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.729
Secrets imply boundaries.
Do you have a secret?

14:15.813 --> 14:17.439
No, it was a hypothetical.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.067
And Dad isn't that bad of a liar.
He can keep things in.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.611
By the way, Daddy, what did you
get up to this afternoon?

14:23.320 --> 14:27.575
Well, I was lacquering up my
wooden ducks in the garage and...

14:28.033 --> 14:30.160
next thing I knew
was high as a kite on fumes.

14:30.244 --> 14:34.123
[sniffs] I woke up on my hammock,
holding a bowl of pimento cheese.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.666
I do not know how I got there.

14:35.749 --> 14:36.667
[chuckles]

14:37.668 --> 14:40.671
Sterl, I'm disappointed
you're not going to be joining us,

14:40.754 --> 14:41.839
but school work does come first.

14:41.922 --> 14:42.840
Yes, sir.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.843
I hope this doesn't mean that you're
bailing on your old Dad, too, Blair.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.095
Even if you're doing
your peaceful protest,

14:48.178 --> 14:49.638
I'd still like
a little daddy-daughter time.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.932
No way. I'm totally, totally psyched.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.183
I'm gonna, you know....

14:54.310 --> 14:57.146
shoot a bunch of innocent animals.

14:57.646 --> 15:00.274
I thought you were opposed to hunting
on moral grounds, honey.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.027
Actually, a lot of hunters
don't support the NRA.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.155
Also, we only shoot older bucks,
right, Daddy?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.656
And not any of the young does.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.533
No does.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.826
And we eat everything we shoot.

15:12.953 --> 15:13.787
Also...

15:15.164 --> 15:15.998
I miss you.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.875
Aww.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.251
I miss you, too.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.045
[chuckles]

15:32.473 --> 15:33.515
Now, can we talk?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.142
Shhh.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.520
[whispering] We want to get into
the right frame of mind,

15:39.104 --> 15:41.023
really feel the deer.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.693
Well, we felt the entire history
of Gettysburg on tape on the way up here,

15:44.777 --> 15:47.279
so I was kind of hoping
that we could talk about life,

15:47.363 --> 15:49.448
and love, and Mom.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.575
You know I love talking about love, baby,

15:51.659 --> 15:54.244
but deer are quiet souls.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.746
Can we not call them souls?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.207
And huntin' is a chance for a man

15:58.958 --> 16:02.378
to really just breathe in and breathe out,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.505
sink into that silence.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.423
[man] Whoo!

16:06.507 --> 16:08.759
Hey oh! [chuckles]

16:08.842 --> 16:09.927
[groans]

16:11.553 --> 16:12.388
Deek.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.224
Lookin' good, ace.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.267
It's good to see you, Big Daddy.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.268
Good to see you, Son.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.771
Hey, no hard feelings about me leaving
the company, right?

16:20.854 --> 16:21.981
I just needed a change.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.400
This isn't  Maury Povich,  Son.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.193
Let's just have a nice hunt.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.569
[Anderson] Okay, Big Daddy.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.989
-Blair.
-Uncle Deacon.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.281
-Give me a hug.
-A hug?

16:31.365 --> 16:33.742
-Oh, yep. All right.
-Yep.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.411
[chuckles] How've you been, bud?

16:35.494 --> 16:36.745
Oh!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.080
-[cackles]
-Deacon. [groans]

16:38.664 --> 16:41.083
Come on.
Would you please keep your voice down?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.001
Sure.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.919
[shouting]
Are you cracking away at those ducks?

16:45.295 --> 16:47.589
That's a hobby, is what that is.
That's all.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.633
Yeah, I've been, I've been,
you know, keeping busy.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.594
I've got my hands in this and that
and so things are good. I'm good.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.304
-That's good to hear, man.
-Thanks.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.015
-Oh!
-Come on!

16:56.098 --> 16:57.266
Come on, Deacon.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.809
You know what keeps me up at night?

16:58.892 --> 17:02.563
[chuckles] How in the hell a guy
like your dad bags a girl like your mom.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.315
I mean, it-- it baffles the   mind, truly.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.235
[chuckles] I love hearing about that.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.195
-Yes. Keep going.
-[Big Daddy] Blair!

17:11.196 --> 17:13.991
You here to ruin our time
yammering on about gun laws?

17:14.074 --> 17:17.036
No, I-- I actually support the right
to bear arms.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.372
But if you need an assault rifle
to take down a whitetail,

17:20.456 --> 17:23.208
you're a lousy shot
and you should get a new hobby.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.961
Finally, something we agree on.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.089
Also the NRA is in with Big Oil

17:29.173 --> 17:31.425
and they are eatin' up
the American wilderness.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.135
Soon, there won't be
anywhere to hunt anyway.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.514
I'm just...

17:37.598 --> 17:38.766
-Oh!
-Jesus!

17:39.349 --> 17:40.559
[Deacon] Easy there.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.937
[snoring]

17:44.021 --> 17:48.442
Okay. Now, let’s just relax
into the quiet.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.736
It's too bad about Sterly Pearly.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.946
That girl loves a gun.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.448
Daggum.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.742
You know who doesn't love a gun, though?

17:57.701 --> 17:59.620
Mom, right?

18:00.245 --> 18:05.084
She would never, like, have one,
or shoot one, or... store one?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.335
That's right. Shh.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.711
Deb's a hell of a shot.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.296
She is?

18:09.797 --> 18:12.925
She took us to a gun range
on a double date when y'all first met.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.053
Taught us how to grunt
like a buck to a doe in heat.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.471
[mimics animal grunting]

18:17.554 --> 18:19.890
-Mom taught you how to sex grunt?
-Oh.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.101
-Language, please!
-She won an award, too.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.646
Yeah, the Peaky Rounding Falls
Sharpshooter Award.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.565
I believe, for taking down a coyote
in Stewart County.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.483
Shh.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.276
Anderson can’t even take down
his own damn name.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.113
Man, how the hell did you
land a girl like Debbie?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.698
-They love each other, Uncle Deacon.
-We fell in love, Deacon.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.367
-[spits]
-[Blair] Eww.

18:38.951 --> 18:42.204
Hey, Dad, when did Mom stop shooting?

18:42.287 --> 18:45.040
I don't know,
sometime before y'all came along.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.668
Why didn't she tell us
that she was a good shot?

18:47.751 --> 18:48.794
Oh...

18:48.877 --> 18:49.920
She probably forgot.

18:50.003 --> 18:56.009
Forgot that she won the Peaky...
Sneaky Blinder Sharpshooting Award?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.511
For taking down a coyote?

18:57.594 --> 18:58.428
Yeah, she must've.

18:58.887 --> 18:59.721
How?

19:01.056 --> 19:02.099
I don't know, Blair.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.226
People change.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.813
Life is long and deer are quiet.

19:07.896 --> 19:08.897
[gun blast]

19:08.981 --> 19:10.983
-[gasps] We got him!
-[groans]

19:11.859 --> 19:12.693
[spits]

19:12.776 --> 19:14.903
[pop music playing]

19:18.031 --> 19:20.159
You are so good at using that saw.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.494
Thanks.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.539
Luke tried to use this once
to make me a pair of wooden flip-flops

19:25.622 --> 19:27.457
and--and he almost took his finger off.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.752
And then, he cried and threw the flip-flop

19:30.836 --> 19:33.755
and didn't calm down until I gave him
a bowl of mac and cheese.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.716
Never send a man to do a woman's job.

19:37.050 --> 19:37.885
Yeah.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.602
I never really got what you saw in Luke.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.478
He always seemed a little...

19:49.396 --> 19:52.107
amorphous... for you.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.820
He was really sweet
and-- and kind and loving but...

19:57.905 --> 20:01.700
yeah, after a while,
I did want someone with a little more...

20:01.783 --> 20:03.577
[stammering] more this than this.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.332
Remember when Luke ate his own ChapStick?

20:09.124 --> 20:10.000
Yeah.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.962
You were reading  Mere Christianity
in the fifth grade. [chuckles]

20:14.504 --> 20:16.965
-How do you remember that?
-Well, he ate the ChapStick,

20:17.049 --> 20:20.219
choked, gagged, threw up
and then you quoted C.S. Lewis to him.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.679
"God will not love you any less

20:22.763 --> 20:25.015
if you happen to be born
with a second-rate brain."

20:25.182 --> 20:26.058
That's it!

20:26.600 --> 20:28.101
My gosh, you were so smart.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.270
You read it, too.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.647
I didn't remember it, though.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.565
Not like  The Lion,
the Witch   and the Wardrobe.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.650
[scoffs]

20:34.733 --> 20:37.361
Well, yeah,
that book is seared into my brain

20:37.444 --> 20:38.737
because it's so sad.

20:38.820 --> 20:39.988
The saddest!

20:40.364 --> 20:43.784
Aslan tied up on that slab of rock,
dead with no mane?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.827
And Tumnus the Fawn, turned to stone.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.162
And Mr. Beaver!

20:47.829 --> 20:48.956
Wait, what was sad about him?

20:49.581 --> 20:52.793
Well, you know, they destroyed
his little beaver house, right?

20:53.835 --> 20:54.795
Oh, yeah, they did.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.839
Yeah, whatever. He had it comin'.

21:03.095 --> 21:03.929
[chuckles]

21:12.145 --> 21:13.522
My dad used to read me those books.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.648
Mine, too.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.198
[turns on electric saw]

21:30.956 --> 21:33.125
[new age music playing]

21:35.502 --> 21:38.922
[chuckling] I'm open to love.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.174
[Bowser] I'm open to love.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.219
I forgive myself and others.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.637
Mm. I...

21:45.721 --> 21:48.140
[clears throat]
...I forgive myself. And others.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.562
I'm connected to others and myself.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.898
I'm connected to others and myself.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.650
I'm one with nature.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.609
[Bowser] I am...

22:00.527 --> 22:02.696
I'm one... Yolanda?

22:03.530 --> 22:05.157
What's-- uh...? Hey.

22:06.742 --> 22:07.576
Why are you here?

22:07.659 --> 22:10.037
I was trying to return your call
and I got worried.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.372
I thought you might have been tied up,
naked and afraid.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.666
[moaning]

22:14.750 --> 22:16.001
I guess that comes later.

22:17.627 --> 22:18.754
Look, uh...

22:18.837 --> 22:20.797
-I'm sorry, I didn't hear my phone ring.
-[moaning]

22:20.881 --> 22:22.799
I-- I just called you
with an update, that's all.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.134
Oh, what's the update?

22:24.885 --> 22:27.095
-Uh, I got Jocelyn's route.
-Ah.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.056
She's on her way
from Chattanooga to Tallahassee.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.057
[Michelle moans]

22:30.140 --> 22:32.934
Her supervisor says sometimes 
she stops at the LaGrange Motel,

22:33.477 --> 22:34.519
down the 85 South.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.729
-All right.
-Yeah.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.980
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.649
So, later, me and the girls,
we'll head out there

22:39.775 --> 22:41.318
and, um... you know...

22:41.443 --> 22:43.570
Hey, you still got
that CB radio in your RV?

22:43.862 --> 22:44.738
I do.

22:44.821 --> 22:45.781
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.908
No!

22:47.991 --> 22:49.743
-[Michelle moans]
-[Bowser] Uh...

22:50.160 --> 22:52.412
-Should I get it?
-I guess it could crawl up here.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.331
[Michelle continues moaning]

22:55.082 --> 22:56.792
I had a nightmare
that started like this once.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.880
What are you doing here, Michelle?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.383
What are any of us doing here...

23:05.050 --> 23:06.593
if you really think about it?

23:07.886 --> 23:10.931
[sighs] I'm meeting producers
for my new record.

23:11.014 --> 23:11.848
Mm.

23:11.932 --> 23:16.144
It's a concept album
about the path to radical self-care,

23:16.228 --> 23:19.940
refilling the soul
with self-love and self-acceptance.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.858
It sounds very selfish.

23:21.942 --> 23:22.859
Oh.

23:22.943 --> 23:25.404
Well, I wouldn't expect you
to understand my process.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.906
Also, something called out to me,

23:27.989 --> 23:29.950
made me feel drawn here to Bowser.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.368
Was it your pathological need

23:31.451 --> 23:33.453
to never let me have anything for myself?

23:33.912 --> 23:34.913
Just spitballing.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.124
Bowser told me you saw the post.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.254
You two look... good together.

23:42.337 --> 23:45.340
I mean, your energies 
are completely incompatible.

23:45.424 --> 23:49.136
[chuckles] Yeah, I suppose
we'd have to have an ugly divorce

23:49.219 --> 23:50.387
to be as close as y'all two.

23:50.470 --> 23:54.599
Oh, sweetie, are you catching feelings
for him... again?

23:55.058 --> 23:56.393
I know what you're up to, Michelle,

23:56.476 --> 23:57.811
and you can't ask him for a loan,

23:57.894 --> 23:58.979
-or a down payment on a car...
-I'm not.

23:59.062 --> 24:00.105
...or a place to stay.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.231
He is just getting back on his feet.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.691
Don't worry so much.

24:02.774 --> 24:05.235
I pulled the Four of Wands
for Bowser's next year.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.281
Success, victory, joy, love.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.116
Maybe a romantic reunion.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.118
Oh, his aura is very bright--

24:13.201 --> 24:14.578
Por favor,   Michèlle!

24:14.661 --> 24:16.037
His aura is shit!

24:16.121 --> 24:17.664
He is still hung up on you

24:17.747 --> 24:19.958
living paycheck-to-paycheck,
barely hangin' on.

24:20.041 --> 24:22.294
You run him around again,
and he will be knocked flat.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.211
[Bowser] Wow.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.508
I didn't realize I was so delicate.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.719
-Bowser.
-No, no, no.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.387
"Barely hanging on, huh?

24:34.097 --> 24:35.265
Good to know that's how you see me.

24:35.348 --> 24:39.436
B, clearly Yolanda doesn't believe
in your growth potential.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.437
But I do.

24:40.854 --> 24:41.980
[Yolanda] That's right.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.315
You believed in him so hard

24:43.398 --> 24:46.776
that you up and left as soon as shit
got the tiniest bit tough, right?

24:47.277 --> 24:48.737
Great. This is just great.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.449
I'm tired of seeing history repeat itself.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.869
I am not going to pick up the pieces
with you again.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.122
Noted.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.086
[door opens and closes]

25:05.754 --> 25:07.797
[Anderson]
Father, we commit this animal to you.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.925
We thank you for its life,

25:11.134 --> 25:12.219
for its sustenance.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.722
And for time with family.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.057
Amen.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.558
-Amen.
-Amen.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.560
Did Dee-daw teach mom to shoot?

25:21.311 --> 25:23.438
You know, I don't recall to be honest.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.439
Well, he must've.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.151
Where do you hunt in Savannah?

25:28.235 --> 25:29.986
[chuckling] I don't know, honey.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.281
You never went hunting
with her or Dee-daw?

25:33.823 --> 25:34.658
I did not.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.661
No, she'd-- she'd given that up
by the time we met.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.080
No, she hadn't.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.165
You guys went shooting with Deacon.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.000
Man, you're like a dog with a bone.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.544
Wait.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.296
Of course, you never went
hunting with Dee-daw.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.464
He died before you guys met.

25:49.756 --> 25:50.840
-Right.
-Right.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.219
I guess it makes sense

25:54.302 --> 25:56.680
that she doesn't like talking
about Mee-maw or Dee-daw much.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.515
I wouldn't want to talk about it either

25:58.598 --> 26:01.560
if my parents died
in a jet crash in the Rockies.

26:01.643 --> 26:02.727
That's exactly right.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.148
It was the Appalachian Mountains, Dad.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.818
They crashed
into the Appalachian Mountains.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.280
I don't know
where the plane crashed, Blair.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.823
The point is that it crashed!

26:15.198 --> 26:17.742
And they are dead and they are gone
and that is sad, so be quiet!

26:18.410 --> 26:20.287
Please, just be quiet!

26:21.830 --> 26:23.456
Daggum, Deacon, get her going.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.002
[flesh ripping]

26:27.752 --> 26:28.878
[Sterling]  He yelled at you?

26:28.962 --> 26:30.672
Yeah. And got sweaty.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.675
and his face turned red like a guava.

26:33.758 --> 26:34.676
Guava's are pink.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.344
Fine, then his face got all pink.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.179
But, like, a fiery, angry pink.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.056
What did he say?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.017
"Be quiet."

26:42.100 --> 26:43.101
[gasps]

26:43.935 --> 26:45.061
Oh, that is awful.

26:45.145 --> 26:45.979
I know.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.773
He is definitely hiding something.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.234
Something about Mom
and Mee-maw and Dee-daw.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.527
[cell phone rings]

26:53.612 --> 26:55.447
Hey, babe. I can't talk right now.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.990
[Miles]  Well, then why'd you answer?

26:57.490 --> 26:58.867
Because it would be rude not to.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.202
I miss you. You've been MIA all week.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.704
Yeah. I know. I'm sorry.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.497
I miss you, too. I've just been...

27:05.457 --> 27:07.667
Well, I've been super, super busy

27:07.751 --> 27:10.086
just, like, with school, and Chloe,

27:10.170 --> 27:12.464
and polishing my lacrosse stick.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.924
Okay. All right. Well, um...

27:15.008 --> 27:16.926
I gotta go.
I promise I'll call you tonight.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.055
Are you okay?

27:20.138 --> 27:21.598
Yeah, no vacancies.

27:21.931 --> 27:23.558
You know what I hate about Yolanda?

27:24.100 --> 27:25.018
She's smug.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.728
Which is a real feat,

27:26.811 --> 27:29.272
especially when everything
is apparently going to shit. You know?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.524
People change, things work out,

27:31.608 --> 27:33.401
the sun rises and it's a new day.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.320
Wow.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.282
You are getting back together
with old, dirty rag Michelle, aren't you?

27:39.366 --> 27:40.492
No!

27:40.659 --> 27:42.410
I don't know. Maybe?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.079
[groans] Bowser!

27:44.746 --> 27:46.915
Sterling, let's play top five reasons

27:46.998 --> 27:49.584
Bowser is going to end up
dead in a ditch somewhere

27:49.668 --> 27:51.127
with a Michelle sticking out of his arm.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.046
I am not addicted, all right?

27:53.797 --> 27:55.632
Um, do-- do you really think
that people change?

27:55.715 --> 27:57.008
Like, if someone likes you like a friend,

27:57.092 --> 27:58.843
maybe tomorrow they'll change their mind?

27:58.927 --> 28:01.221
Sure. You gotta trust
that good things are coming.

28:02.138 --> 28:03.223
Surrender to the universe.

28:03.306 --> 28:05.558
Excuse me, who are you talking about?

28:06.142 --> 28:07.435
Chase Colton? Huh?

28:07.977 --> 28:09.020
Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.272
No one in particular, just a hypothetical.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.315
Advice.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.983
-From Bowser?
-Yeah.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.403
-Really?
-He's right here.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.697
-Okay, thanks.
-You should totally go for Chase.

28:19.155 --> 28:21.825
I used to think that he was really boring
and bad at math,

28:21.908 --> 28:25.328
but he changed his hair part
really deep left

28:25.412 --> 28:28.373
-and he looks so, so good.
-Hm.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.086
Is that them? Is that the Durbins?

28:33.169 --> 28:34.295
Hey hey...

28:38.633 --> 28:39.634
Wow, see?

28:40.635 --> 28:41.761
If you choose Michelle,

28:42.220 --> 28:43.471
this is who you'll end up like,

28:44.055 --> 28:47.016
just a couple of junkies
jonesing for their next fix.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.018
Thank you, Dr. fucking Freud.

28:49.477 --> 28:50.311
Is this a drug deal?

28:50.395 --> 28:52.480
Is this, like... with drugs and stuff?

28:52.564 --> 28:54.149
-Is that what's happening right now?
-Yeah.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.692
-Come on. Let's go.
-[Sterling sighs]

29:15.253 --> 29:16.087
[cocks gun]

29:16.921 --> 29:18.423
-[groans]
-Last resort.

29:18.506 --> 29:19.758
There's a drug deal happening!

29:19.841 --> 29:21.259
Last resort! Put it away now!

29:22.719 --> 29:24.304
All right. Stay behind me.

29:24.387 --> 29:25.430
This could get hairy.

29:25.513 --> 29:26.514
Don't you trust us?

29:26.973 --> 29:29.851
Yeah. Trust us
like you trust the universe.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.437
We're professionals and adults.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.231
There is nothing behind that door
that we cannot handle

29:35.815 --> 29:37.358
-What the fuck?
-Nobody move!

29:38.067 --> 29:39.861
-Eww.
-They're naked!

29:39.944 --> 29:41.070
Get the fuck out of here!

29:41.154 --> 29:43.031
Yeah, we've got the room
for the next 45 minutes.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.407
Gary Durbin?

29:45.492 --> 29:46.868
-No. Why is it purple?
-Oh, god.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.161
[Bowser] You're under arrest.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.621
I'm a bail enforcement officer.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.665
-Move away from the human pyramid here.
-[Blair] Sorry, guys.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.542
Okay. Don't everybody move!

29:54.959 --> 29:56.669
-[both scream]
-Cold!

29:56.753 --> 29:57.796
What the fuck? Get down!

29:58.421 --> 30:00.381
-[Blair] Are you okay?
-[Sterling] Yeah!

30:00.465 --> 30:01.341
Stupid bitches!

30:02.175 --> 30:04.719
-[screams]
-Sterl! Watch out, Bowser!

30:05.345 --> 30:07.597
-[groans]
-Get out of here, Gary!

30:08.973 --> 30:09.933
Go! Go! Go!

30:12.977 --> 30:14.646
-He's naked!
-And fast!

30:19.150 --> 30:20.193
Watch out!

30:21.152 --> 30:21.986
Whoa!

30:23.071 --> 30:24.364
-Ow!
-Are you okay?

30:24.447 --> 30:27.033
[Bowser] He's getting away!
Sterl! Last resort!

30:27.116 --> 30:29.077
-Shoot him?
-No! Shoot the lights!

30:34.958 --> 30:35.792
[gasps]

30:37.335 --> 30:39.420
[groans]

30:41.297 --> 30:43.383
Yeah! Yeah!

30:43.716 --> 30:44.884
Yeah, that's my girl.

30:46.344 --> 30:47.262
[Sterling] Don't roll!

30:47.345 --> 30:48.888
Sir, your front stuff!

30:48.972 --> 30:50.098
[groans]

30:50.181 --> 30:51.933
Um, sir? I'm going to cuff you now.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.226
Put your hands where we can--

30:53.309 --> 30:56.938
[screams] Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna cuff-- I'm gonna cuff your feet.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.733
Are you kiddin' me, Gary? Amphetamines?

31:00.817 --> 31:02.819
What did I tell you about what we share?

31:02.902 --> 31:04.279
Share if there's blood in your poop.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.823
And share if you've committed a crime!

31:07.365 --> 31:08.533
Did you ever sell to Edwards?

31:08.992 --> 31:12.078
Because he is six months sober
and I swear to God, Gary--

31:12.161 --> 31:13.413
I didn't sell to Edwards.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.123
And I don't have blood in my poop.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.208
-It's black.
-Your poop is black?

31:18.042 --> 31:20.003
Shit, Gary! That's blood!

31:20.086 --> 31:21.629
Okay, he could have eaten an Oreo.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.549
-We have to get him to a doctor.
-Not on my watch, friends.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.217
Can you open the door for me?

31:26.301 --> 31:27.844
-Okay.
-Come on, black poop, let's go.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.597
[Jocelyn] He never listened to me.
Anything I said.

31:33.641 --> 31:37.186
So... y'all three are in a relationship?

31:37.478 --> 31:38.479
How can you tell?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.523
How did that happen?

31:40.690 --> 31:42.775
Did she approach you or...?

31:42.859 --> 31:44.110
I met Tina at a bar.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.946
We talked about it
and then we took it for a spin.

31:47.822 --> 31:48.698
But what did you say?

31:48.781 --> 31:50.283
How did y'all broach the subject?

31:50.366 --> 31:51.826
-[scoffs] Well--
-I've got this friend

31:51.910 --> 31:53.411
and she doesn't know that I like her,

31:53.494 --> 31:55.455
and we're religious
so I don't know what to say

31:55.538 --> 31:57.415
or if she's going to tell my parents,

31:57.707 --> 31:59.417
or my teachers,

31:59.584 --> 32:02.045
or the pastor,
who loves married people having sex

32:02.128 --> 32:05.924
but not non-married women having sex
with other women.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.009
Not that I'm a lesbian.
I like penises, too, right?

32:08.426 --> 32:09.427
That's your call, honey.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.137
Right.

32:11.387 --> 32:12.847
Listen, either way,
I have to tell her soon

32:12.931 --> 32:15.808
because if keep it inside any longer, 
I'm gonna die.

32:17.852 --> 32:18.728
Well, look.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.272
I think you should just start slow.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.193
Throw out the bait,
see if she bites, and go from there.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.362
You really think that'll work?

32:27.445 --> 32:29.781
My husband's going to jail
with glass in his feet.

32:29.864 --> 32:30.990
I don't fucking know.

32:31.074 --> 32:31.950
Language.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.368
[clears throat]

32:34.702 --> 32:35.536
Thank you!

32:36.204 --> 32:37.747
[Bowser] Sterling! Let's go!

32:38.289 --> 32:39.123
Yep.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.294
Well, I think we'll get points
for style and accuracy.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.296
Your lamb looks like it's bleeding out.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.298
-Is it too much?
-No.

32:49.634 --> 32:50.760
We make a really good team.

32:51.052 --> 32:51.886
I guess so.

32:52.971 --> 32:53.888
You're less...

32:54.806 --> 32:56.432
blinky in your own home.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.268
And you did what I told you to,
which felt good.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.437
I aim to please.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.522
Noted.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.946
You know who's also a really good team?

33:10.363 --> 33:11.739
Naomi and Ruth from the Bible.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.241
I really like that story.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.450
Yeah, me too, actually.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.368
Really?

33:15.785 --> 33:16.744
Yeah.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.622
Two women left on their own
who make the best of a bad situation,

33:19.706 --> 33:21.791
securing their fortune
without the help of a man?

33:24.794 --> 33:26.045
I read that they were together.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.130
Yeah, of course they were together.

33:27.213 --> 33:28.339
Women couldn't travel alone back then.

33:28.423 --> 33:31.926
No, um... like, "together-together,"

33:32.135 --> 33:34.637
like, they cleaved or whatever.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.638
[chuckles]

33:35.722 --> 33:38.891
What do you mean, "cleaved"?
Like... "sex"?

33:39.183 --> 33:41.602
Yeah. It's the same Hebrew word,

33:41.686 --> 33:43.187
like Naomi cleaved to Ruth

33:43.271 --> 33:45.648
like how Adam cleaved to Eve.

33:46.983 --> 33:50.069
[scoffs] That's a loose interpretation.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.779
Well, what about Jonathan and David?

33:51.863 --> 33:54.323
Jonathan grew "full" thinking about David.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.616
"Full," like, erect.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.036
Okay. What about the Apostle Paul?

33:58.119 --> 34:01.581
Romans 1:26: "For this reason, God
gave them up to degrading passions.

34:01.664 --> 34:03.791
Their women exchanged natural intercourse

34:03.875 --> 34:05.376
-for unnatural--"
-I hate Paul.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.087
The Apostle Paul?

34:08.171 --> 34:09.380
He's so annoying.

34:09.756 --> 34:12.508
He also said that women
should learn in silence.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.553
Like, "You smile and shush, Paul."

34:16.596 --> 34:18.765
Why should the Bible
be a rule book for sex, anyway?

34:18.848 --> 34:20.099
It's 2000 years old.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.602
It contradicts itself
in, like, a bajillion different places.

34:22.685 --> 34:26.355
Its big points are "love thy neighbor"
and "protect the poor,"

34:26.439 --> 34:29.150
but all anybody can ever talk about
is sex and purity,

34:29.233 --> 34:32.111
and one man and one woman, r-- right?

34:34.322 --> 34:36.991
I'm sorry... what are you saying?

34:38.451 --> 34:42.330
Um... Just that Naomi and Ruth kick butt,
that's all.

34:45.625 --> 34:46.459
Okay.

34:49.837 --> 34:50.671
All right.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.006
Get you some drink there, greenie.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.884
-Yeah.
-[knocking]

34:55.676 --> 34:56.511
Hey.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.096
Here's your check.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.263
Oh.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.181
Thank you.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.808
Hey, look, um...

35:03.601 --> 35:06.062
I know you think you know 
what me and Michelle got.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.398
And I'll admit, there is a pattern.

35:10.858 --> 35:11.734
But you're not in it.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.320
So you don't know what it could be.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.823
And I have changed. 
I don't care what you think.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.076
And if I've changed, change is possible.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.329
Actually...

35:24.997 --> 35:26.332
I should apologize.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.501
It really is none of my business

35:29.252 --> 35:31.170
and I shouldn't have said any of that,

35:31.254 --> 35:32.880
not to the girls and not to you.

35:33.881 --> 35:34.757
I'm sorry.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.761
I don't know that many people
here in Atlanta.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.221
Truth is...

35:41.389 --> 35:42.974
you're one of my best friends.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.768
I don't want to see you get hurt...

35:47.353 --> 35:49.480
or say you're one with nature.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.440
[snickers]

35:52.984 --> 35:54.402
But it's your life, Bowser.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.863
You know what's best for you.

36:07.623 --> 36:08.791
Congrats on the skip.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.924
[Blair]  Are we here at the wrong time?

36:17.008 --> 36:18.050
No, I'm re-reading it.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.678
It says, "8:00 p.m. family meeting,"
in her text,

36:20.761 --> 36:22.054
and it's 7:59.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.140
She's always two minutes early.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.184
[groans]

36:26.267 --> 36:27.101
I feel sick.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.978
Dad knew I was so suspicious.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.438
There's no way he didn't tell her.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.524
Well, maybe it's not about the gun
or the storage unit or anything, you know?

36:33.608 --> 36:36.569
Maybe... Maybe Chloe's got
a new walk schedule or something.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.946
No, I want it to be about that stuff.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.948
If they don't talk about it,
I'm going to confront them.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.033
Confront who?

36:42.450 --> 36:44.827
Um, Ezekiel and Hannah B.
They mimicked me.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.245
Oh.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.457
We have some questions
for the two of you, actually.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.626
That's what we'd like
to talk to you about.

36:52.335 --> 36:54.962
[Anderson]
Blair seemed curious on the trip.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.255
And...

36:56.339 --> 36:58.758
I sometimes forget...

37:00.092 --> 37:01.385
parts of your mother's life.

37:01.469 --> 37:05.431
And then we realized
that we haven't really shared...

37:05.514 --> 37:06.849
-Mm.
-...much with you.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.935
No, and that is mostly my fault.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.813
Y'all know that I've had a difficult time
talking about Mee-maw and Dee-daw,

37:12.897 --> 37:14.565
but I never really explained why.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.319
Well, um...
before they left for the airport,

37:19.403 --> 37:20.947
the three of us got into a big fight.

37:22.114 --> 37:24.242
I'd snuck out of the house
to go to a party

37:24.659 --> 37:27.787
and, um... well, they found out
and confronted me

37:27.870 --> 37:30.331
and... I disrespected them.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.167
I said some awful things.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.585
What things?

37:35.044 --> 37:35.878
Well...

37:37.546 --> 37:38.881
girls, I, uh...

37:42.051 --> 37:45.805
I told them that... I hated them.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.432
You should've seen Dee-daw's face.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.936
I told him they were... pathetic

37:52.019 --> 37:53.771
and old and out of touch, you know.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.942
Anyway, they left to go fly to New York.

37:58.025 --> 37:59.610
I refused to say goodbye
and that was that,

37:59.694 --> 38:00.736
I never saw them again.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.489
So, I don't talk much...

38:04.407 --> 38:06.951
about Savannah or my life there.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.370
Or huntin' with Dee-daw...

38:10.246 --> 38:11.706
because I just can't.

38:13.040 --> 38:13.874
But...

38:15.293 --> 38:16.377
[sighs]

38:16.460 --> 38:18.421
girls, I need you to know that I love you.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.339
Oh, I love you so much and...

38:22.091 --> 38:23.509
I do want you to know me.

38:25.511 --> 38:26.429
So, um...

38:26.887 --> 38:28.014
Here. [chuckles]

38:32.268 --> 38:33.769
-[exhales deeply]
-Oh!

38:36.897 --> 38:39.817
Oh, Mom, your little baby rollers!

38:39.900 --> 38:41.193
That was mama's first perm.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.403
[chuckles]

38:45.114 --> 38:46.449
[Debbie] That was by our house.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.160
We used to walk down to the candy store

38:49.243 --> 38:51.120
and make ourselves
just sick on Lemonheads.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.248
Something wrong, honey?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.501
No, I-- I...

38:59.003 --> 39:00.254
I thought that maybe...

39:04.342 --> 39:06.552
I don't know what I thought,  actually.

39:07.636 --> 39:08.554
Can I keep this?

39:08.637 --> 39:10.639
Yeah. It's yours. This is all yours now.

39:11.932 --> 39:13.225
I'm gonna go to bed now.

39:22.818 --> 39:23.652
Oh.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.198
Hey, Blairsy.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.407
Yeah.

39:28.866 --> 39:29.950
[sighs]

39:30.534 --> 39:34.205
I-- I know you might have been expecting
something more exciting, but...

39:34.705 --> 39:35.539
I wasn't.

39:36.040 --> 39:36.874
It's okay.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.460
Questioning stuff is important.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.463
I don't want you to lose that.

39:44.048 --> 39:44.882
Never.

39:45.966 --> 39:46.801
You hear me?

39:48.052 --> 39:48.886
Sure.

39:49.595 --> 39:50.429
Look...

39:53.808 --> 39:55.810
You know, I had a really good time
hunting with you.

39:58.854 --> 40:00.147
We should do that again sometime.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.150
Yeah.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.152
Yeah.

40:06.612 --> 40:07.446
Goodnight.

Hey. What's this?

40:28.008 --> 40:30.177
Ooh, a celebration. [chuckles]

40:30.261 --> 40:31.220
Oh?

40:31.303 --> 40:32.763
So I met with that producer.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.974
Oh, yeah?

40:35.057 --> 40:38.644
Baby, I didn't realize
how expensive it is to produce an album.

40:38.727 --> 40:40.020
-Oh.
-Mm-hm.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.982
He asked if we can go digital
on the trumpets.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.818
[flutters lips]
I was, like, "No, of course not.

40:45.901 --> 40:47.319
I don't want to be laughed off the radio."

40:47.778 --> 40:51.157
So that'll be another 2,000, 3,000.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.950
-Is that right?
-Mm-hm.

40:53.033 --> 40:57.121
But then he played my demo
over the phone for this financier

40:57.913 --> 41:00.124
and he wants to finance the whole album!

41:00.958 --> 41:02.460
All 23 tracks!

41:03.002 --> 41:04.170
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.298
We start laying them down on Monday.

41:07.381 --> 41:08.424
[chuckles]

41:09.049 --> 41:10.593
-Mmm.
-Wow.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.054
Hey. What happened to all your stuff?

41:14.680 --> 41:15.514
Oh, well...

41:16.474 --> 41:17.683
I found a place.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.561
It's just a little apartment
over a hookah bar,

41:21.312 --> 41:26.775
but... I was thinking
that if we're gonna have a real shot,

41:27.568 --> 41:30.279
we should start slow
and switch things up a bit.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.823
-[exhales deeply]
-What do you say?

41:32.907 --> 41:33.991
Does that sound good?

41:35.451 --> 41:36.952
-Mm.
-Wait, wait.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.078
Um...

41:39.246 --> 41:40.122
You've changed, right?

41:41.499 --> 41:46.212
I mean, we were fiending for each other
pretty... pretty bad back then, and...

41:47.796 --> 41:48.923
we're different now.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.424
-Change?
-Yeah.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.218
You're telling me to change?

41:52.301 --> 41:54.136
[chuckles] I don't need to change.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.429
You're the one that stopped trying.

42:00.142 --> 42:00.976

42:02.728 --> 42:04.146
-Okay.
-Mm.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.982
Well, I think now it's time
for me to try something new.

[chuckles]

42:08.776 --> 42:10.027
-Something new?
-Yeah.
