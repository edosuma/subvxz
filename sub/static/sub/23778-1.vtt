00:51.908 --> 00:54.476
Oh, hurry up, Mr. Dickens!

00:54.478 --> 00:56.878
Hey, I paid 50 cents for this!

00:56.880 --> 00:59.247
- Come on, Dickens!
- Come on, Charley!

01:01.283 --> 01:04.284
We want Charles!

01:04.286 --> 01:06.022
I want to see Charles!

01:07.323 --> 01:09.389
Where is Dickens?

01:31.147 --> 01:32.880
<i>My dear Forster,</i>

01:32.882 --> 01:34.848
<i>how can I give you
the faintest notion</i>

01:34.850 --> 01:36.918
<i>of my reception
here in America?</i>

01:36.920 --> 01:39.820
Five minutes. Five minutes.

01:39.822 --> 01:43.190
<i>Of the crowds that pour
in and out the whole day,</i>

01:43.192 --> 01:45.794
<i>of the people that line the
streets when I go out.</i>

01:54.236 --> 01:56.004
Places, please. Places!

01:56.006 --> 01:57.104
Hello, Charley.

01:57.106 --> 01:59.841
<i>Of the balls, dinners,</i>

01:59.843 --> 02:03.344
<i>speeches, parties,
assemblies without end.</i>

02:03.346 --> 02:07.248
<i>There never was a king or emperor
upon the earth so cheered.</i>

02:09.953 --> 02:12.887
Tonight, live on stage...

02:12.889 --> 02:14.189
Ready?

02:14.191 --> 02:17.424
- the great magician of our time...
- Ready.

02:17.426 --> 02:19.828
whose wand is a book!

02:19.830 --> 02:21.963
The Shakespeare
of the novel.

02:21.965 --> 02:24.165
The people's author.

02:24.167 --> 02:27.869
The great and marvelous Boz!

02:27.871 --> 02:31.371
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:31.373 --> 02:34.475
Mr. Charles Dickens!

02:34.477 --> 02:38.015
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

02:41.016 --> 02:42.616
Thank you! Thank you!

02:42.618 --> 02:45.453
Look, it's him!
It's really him!

02:50.560 --> 02:52.927
- Hey there, Boz!
- Whoo!

02:52.929 --> 02:56.030
Dear friends! Dear friends!

02:56.032 --> 03:00.067
You have welcomed me to your country
with such open arms that I fear I...

03:00.069 --> 03:02.002
Ohh!

03:10.280 --> 03:13.513
<i>Americans are friendly,</i>

03:13.515 --> 03:16.250
<i>earnest, hospitable,</i>

03:16.252 --> 03:18.521
<i>kind, frank, accomplished,</i>

03:19.656 --> 03:22.155
<i>warm-hearted, fervent,</i>

03:22.157 --> 03:24.561
<i>and... enthusiastic.</i>

03:26.395 --> 03:28.031
<i>I can't wait to get home.</i>

04:54.184 --> 04:56.550
Mrs. Fisk,
I have told you repeatedly

04:56.552 --> 04:58.519
not to disturb me
when I am working.

05:01.690 --> 05:05.425
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
Only, Mr. Forster is here.

05:05.427 --> 05:07.060
Forster.
Yes, of course.

05:07.062 --> 05:09.230
As you can see,
Mr. Forster,

05:09.232 --> 05:11.598
we're having all-new
wallpaper put in, French,

05:11.600 --> 05:13.634
new doors,
new door knocker,

05:13.636 --> 05:15.702
new roller blinds
for the windows,

05:15.704 --> 05:20.007
new bookcases in the
library, a new chandelier,

05:20.009 --> 05:22.243
all chosen by Charles,
of course.

05:22.245 --> 05:24.611
And the staircase is
to be painted green.

05:24.613 --> 05:27.548
- Though not too dull a green, Signor Mazzini.
- <i>Ma certo. SÃ¬, capisce.</i>

05:27.550 --> 05:29.517
You know how Charles is.

05:29.519 --> 05:32.156
- Only the best for Mr. Dickens.
- Yes.

05:33.288 --> 05:37.257
Mr. Forster,
if you'll allow me,

05:37.259 --> 05:39.260
how do things stand between
you and Miss Wigmore?

05:39.262 --> 05:40.762
Oh, splendid,
Mrs. Dickens.

05:40.764 --> 05:43.798
In fact, I intend
to ask her to bestow upon me

05:43.800 --> 05:45.703
the greatest happiness
a man can ever know.

05:47.202 --> 05:49.570
Well, to marry me.

05:49.572 --> 05:51.406
Oh!

05:51.408 --> 05:53.440
Oh, I'm very glad
to hear that.

05:53.442 --> 05:56.476
Forster! Forster, Forster, Forster.
So sorry!

05:56.478 --> 05:58.579
I completely lost track
of the time.

05:58.581 --> 06:00.048
- Shall we?
- Charles.

06:00.050 --> 06:01.615
- You need to pay Signor Mazzini.
- Hmm?

06:01.617 --> 06:03.584
For the parlor mantle.

06:03.586 --> 06:05.752
- How much?
- Seventy-five pounds.

06:05.754 --> 06:09.156
Seventy-five?
What's it made of, gold?

06:09.158 --> 06:12.360
Carrara marble, Signor.
Finest quality.

06:12.362 --> 06:14.394
No gentleman
would accept less.

06:14.396 --> 06:16.630
No? Well, quite.

06:16.632 --> 06:19.469
Well, I will have the money for you
when I return, Signor Mazzini.

06:21.071 --> 06:22.239
Good day, Mrs. Dickens.

06:23.173 --> 06:24.605
Good day, Mr. Forster.

06:28.812 --> 06:32.079
Ah! Come in!

06:32.081 --> 06:34.082
Good-bye,
little strangers!

06:34.084 --> 06:35.315
Bye!

06:35.317 --> 06:37.721
- Say good-bye to Mr. Forster, children!
- Bye!

06:40.189 --> 06:43.091
- I'll hail us a cab.
- What? No, it's a waste of money. We'll walk.

06:43.093 --> 06:45.093
It's damned expensive
being a gentleman.

06:45.095 --> 06:46.526
Forster,
this meeting...

06:46.528 --> 06:48.296
- Aye! I know my job.
- Good.

06:48.298 --> 06:50.565
- And the money?
- Leave the publishers to me.

06:50.567 --> 06:52.433
Good.

06:52.435 --> 06:54.637
Slow down!
What's the hurry?

06:59.408 --> 07:00.875
Charles
Bloody Dickens, huh?

07:00.877 --> 07:04.545
The best-selling bloody author in the
history of English bloody literature.

07:04.547 --> 07:08.315
Three of his books you have published
in the last year and a half. Three!

07:08.317 --> 07:10.183
So where's the money?

07:10.185 --> 07:13.654
Mr. Forster, like you, we are as
puzzled as the Egyptians in their fog.

07:13.656 --> 07:15.723
- How's that?
<i>- Martin Chuzzlewit.</i>

07:15.725 --> 07:19.459
A masterpiece of the
picaresque genre, and yet...

07:19.461 --> 07:21.796
<i>Barnaby Rudge.</i> A fine book.
An important subject.

07:21.798 --> 07:23.764
But, alas...

07:23.766 --> 07:26.233
And the travel book,
<i>American Notes.</i>

07:26.235 --> 07:28.668
Perhaps a little too candid
for our American cousins.

07:28.670 --> 07:31.171
No joke. I heard they were burning
copies of it in the streets.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.308
Well, they're mad as snakes,
the Yanks.

07:35.310 --> 07:38.613
But what about this 50 pound a month
you're withholding from his royalties?

07:38.615 --> 07:40.581
What is the explanation
for that?

07:40.583 --> 07:43.885
You may remember that when Mr. Dickens
approached us about the tour to America,

07:43.887 --> 07:46.521
we were pleased to provide him
with an interest-free loan.

07:46.523 --> 07:49.490
With the provision that, in
the unlikely case of profits

07:49.492 --> 07:51.858
being inadequate
to certain repayments...

07:51.860 --> 07:55.396
What? So he's had a couple of flops?
Well, who hasn't? Huh?

07:55.398 --> 07:57.264
Your publishing house
wouldn't exist without this man.

07:57.266 --> 07:59.834
What about an advance?

07:59.836 --> 08:02.736
- On?
- A new book.

08:02.738 --> 08:04.440
You have a new book
in mind?

08:06.809 --> 08:09.343
Yes.
Of course he does.

08:09.345 --> 08:12.647
Well, in that case, I mean we'd
obviously love to consider it.

08:12.649 --> 08:15.451
- Consider?
- That is to say, if we like it.

08:16.685 --> 08:19.322
- If?
- I'm sure that we will.

08:21.790 --> 08:23.591
Gentlemen,
I bid you good day.

08:23.593 --> 08:27.228
Mr. Forster, please, we had no
intention of causing offense.

08:27.230 --> 08:28.663
Well,
he's in a fettle now.

08:28.665 --> 08:30.865
I'll give him a day
to calm down.

08:30.867 --> 08:33.700
And then...
It's most awkward.

08:33.702 --> 08:36.337
<i>He</i> was in last week,

08:36.339 --> 08:38.238
in some difficulty.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.573
Again.

08:39.576 --> 08:41.876
No, that's not possible.
He's in the countryside.

08:41.878 --> 08:44.214
He's under strict
instructions to remain there.

08:46.515 --> 08:47.750
What is it this time?

08:58.360 --> 09:00.962
"I need money immediately or
productive of fatal consequences,

09:00.964 --> 09:03.797
I beseech you
to do the needful..."

09:03.799 --> 09:07.803
He's been offering Mr. Dickens's
autographs for sale in the newspapers.

09:13.308 --> 09:16.477
- How much did you give him?
- Forty-five, all told.

09:16.479 --> 09:17.479
Forty-five?

09:19.749 --> 09:23.316
Well,
I'll pay it all back.

09:23.318 --> 09:25.521
But not a word of this
to Charles, do you hear?

09:39.701 --> 09:41.701
"What's the secret?"
they say.

09:41.703 --> 09:43.206
There is no secret.
I sit down...

09:45.942 --> 09:49.910
- Charles. What are you doing here?
- I'm hiding from Thackeray.

09:49.912 --> 09:52.345
They absolutely
come pouring out of me.

09:52.347 --> 09:54.781
He'll no doubt want to commiserate
me on my <i>Chuzzlewit</i> reviews,

09:54.783 --> 09:56.783
which he will quote
by heart.

09:56.785 --> 09:58.287
Come on.

10:08.664 --> 10:12.699
I am clammin' for some scran.
Where's Robertson?

10:12.701 --> 10:14.602
Why do we come here,
hmm?

10:14.604 --> 10:18.339
The service is terrible. The food is
inedible. The fees keep going up.

10:18.341 --> 10:20.344
It's full of...

10:24.413 --> 10:25.945
Gentlemen.

10:25.947 --> 10:27.714
You're not Robertson.

10:27.716 --> 10:29.586
The name is Marley, sir.

10:30.886 --> 10:33.753
- Marley? Marley with an "E"?
- Yes, sir.

10:33.755 --> 10:35.823
Hmm.

10:35.825 --> 10:38.658
Uh, oh, don't worry.
He collects names.

10:38.660 --> 10:40.895
We'll have some oysters
and a bottle of champagne.

10:40.897 --> 10:42.466
Very good, sir.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.633
- Champagne?
- We're celebrating.

10:46.635 --> 10:49.369
- Celebrating?
- Hello, Thackeray.

10:49.371 --> 10:51.571
- How are you?
- Tolerable.

10:51.573 --> 10:53.074
I thank ye.

10:53.076 --> 10:55.776
Charles, I must say I am relieved
to see you out and about.

10:55.778 --> 10:57.777
Relieved?

10:57.779 --> 11:00.781
You know, after those vile things
they wrote about <i>Chuzzlewit.</i>

11:00.783 --> 11:03.584
I won't even
call them reviews.

11:03.586 --> 11:05.685
- No matter. I never read them.
- Quite right.

11:05.687 --> 11:08.457
Scandalous what one is
allowed to print nowadays.

11:16.532 --> 11:18.531
Go on.
What did they say?

11:18.533 --> 11:21.901
"Dull, vapid, and vulgar.

11:21.903 --> 11:26.806
Not a single character capable of
exciting the reader's sympathies."

11:26.808 --> 11:29.776
I certainly didn't think
it was vulgar.

11:29.778 --> 11:32.079
Oh, look.
There's Macready.

11:32.081 --> 11:35.583
Poor thing. His <i>Macbeth</i> was
absolutely shredded in the <i>Times.</i>

11:35.585 --> 11:37.921
I must go and give him
my condolences.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.690
I'm sick of London.

11:43.692 --> 11:45.425
It's overcrowded,
overpriced...

11:45.427 --> 11:47.795
- You love this town.
- No place for a man without money.

11:47.797 --> 11:49.930
Not to mention
the bloody fog.

11:49.932 --> 11:52.836
But it's your inspiration, your
what-do-you-call-it... your magic lamp.

11:59.174 --> 12:01.441
I tell you, Forster,
my lamp's gone out.

12:01.443 --> 12:03.511
I've run out of ideas.

12:03.513 --> 12:05.045
I feel old.

12:07.517 --> 12:08.951
Old?
You're a puppy.

12:11.052 --> 12:13.820
You're exhausted, that's all.
Too many speeches.

12:13.822 --> 12:16.456
I've got another one tomorrow
for the Children's Refuge.

12:16.458 --> 12:18.592
Well, you have to learn
to say no.

12:18.594 --> 12:22.162
How can I say no if I can be useful, if
I can lighten the burden of another?

12:22.164 --> 12:25.031
Well, you have to, what with your
new commission to think about.

12:25.033 --> 12:27.801
Forster, I just told you that...
Sorry. New commission?

12:27.803 --> 12:30.905
It's from Chapman and Hall,
for your new book.

12:30.907 --> 12:33.473
I've told them you'll have the first
chapter done by the end of the year.

12:33.475 --> 12:36.109
You like a deadline.

12:36.111 --> 12:38.881
- Do you mind telling me what it's about?
- I'll leave that up to you.

13:31.567 --> 13:34.734
And on Christmas
Eve, they say,

13:34.736 --> 13:36.871
the fairy mounds open wide

13:36.873 --> 13:39.839
and the fire spirits
pour into the night.

13:39.841 --> 13:42.675
And then
the Lord of the Dead

13:42.677 --> 13:45.813
leads all of the spirits
into a wild hunt.

13:45.815 --> 13:47.214
And he calls to them...

14:10.907 --> 14:13.641
- Do we have a new housemaid?
- What?

14:13.643 --> 14:16.075
Uh, yes. Tara.

14:16.077 --> 14:19.081
She's Irish.
Charley adores her.

14:23.653 --> 14:24.921
What are you doing?

14:26.688 --> 14:29.290
- It was only a stub.
- Another hour in that.

14:29.292 --> 14:32.660
- Oh, really, Charles.
- If you carry on like this, we'll end up in the poor house.

14:32.662 --> 14:34.328
- You're funny.
- I'm not joking.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.095
Charles!

14:36.097 --> 14:39.233
You give money to every and
any beggar in the street.

14:39.235 --> 14:43.036
You insist we move to a bigger house
and order in all new fixtures,

14:43.038 --> 14:45.138
and then you complain
about a new candle.

14:45.140 --> 14:47.877
Debt is an ogre, Kate. If you're
not careful, it can eat you up.

14:50.779 --> 14:52.780
Are we in trouble?

14:52.782 --> 14:55.049
No, of course not.

14:55.051 --> 14:56.686
Then what?

14:57.653 --> 14:59.887
Nothing.

14:59.889 --> 15:03.125
I'm just sick of writing tooth
and nail for bread, that's all.

15:04.293 --> 15:05.993
Hmm.

15:05.995 --> 15:08.896
- Should've become a journalist.
- You hate the press.

15:08.898 --> 15:11.198
- Or a lawyer.
- "The law is an ass."

15:11.200 --> 15:13.267
I believe you wrote that.

15:13.269 --> 15:15.905
A hairdresser, then,
in the Burlington Arcade.

15:17.306 --> 15:19.607
Do you know what
I should have liked to be?

15:19.609 --> 15:21.642
An explorer,

15:21.644 --> 15:24.877
paddling a canoe somewhere
in the wilds of Canada

15:24.879 --> 15:27.714
in a pair
of buckskin breeches,

15:27.716 --> 15:29.782
all on my own.

15:29.784 --> 15:31.288
No nappies to change.

15:37.192 --> 15:38.727
By the way, dear,

15:39.861 --> 15:41.932
I-I saw the doctor today.

15:47.736 --> 15:49.637
Not another...
little stranger.

15:49.639 --> 15:51.738
Are you pleased?

15:51.740 --> 15:53.706
Well, of course.

15:56.879 --> 15:58.748
- Well, that's splendid.
- Yes.

16:11.860 --> 16:15.764
I am a necromancer.

16:17.133 --> 16:18.868
Behold.

16:35.317 --> 16:37.751
And now...

16:50.331 --> 16:53.099
Charley.

16:53.101 --> 16:55.969
Charley,
it's all right.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.905
I'm here.

17:15.223 --> 17:18.191
Mistress Chickenstalker!

17:18.193 --> 17:20.728
Mistress Chickenstalker, what
has happened to your pinnie?

17:20.730 --> 17:22.729
You look as if you've
been caught in a cyclone.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.330
That's much better.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.137
Master Corporal Skittles, sir.
On your feet, sir!

17:34.210 --> 17:37.413
Ah, Lucifer Box.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.317
Would you do me the honor?

17:42.384 --> 17:44.117
Good.

17:44.119 --> 17:48.221
Ah, the Snodgering Blee.
We meet at last.

17:48.223 --> 17:50.056
What's this?

17:50.058 --> 17:53.026
You have forgotten
to wash behind your ear.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.362
Cor!

17:55.364 --> 17:58.201
Now you must be...
Don't... Don't tell me.

17:59.367 --> 18:01.034
- Who is that?
- Tara.

18:01.036 --> 18:03.237
Tara. Of course.

18:03.239 --> 18:05.439
I see you've made a conquest.

18:05.441 --> 18:07.940
What was that wonderful story
I overheard you telling

18:07.942 --> 18:11.411
about fairy mounds
and the fire spirits?

18:11.413 --> 18:15.882
Only a story my gran used to tell
us, sir, back home in Ireland.

18:15.884 --> 18:17.985
She used to say
that on Christmas Eve

18:17.987 --> 18:21.220
the veils between this world
and the next thin out,

18:21.222 --> 18:24.894
and that's when the spirits
cross over and walk among us.

18:26.194 --> 18:27.797
Do they indeed?

18:29.030 --> 18:31.364
Well, well, well.

18:31.366 --> 18:33.001
Christmas Eve.

18:41.442 --> 18:43.943
Thank you so much
for coming.

18:43.945 --> 18:46.815
- It was such an interesting speech.
- Thank you very much.

18:47.817 --> 18:50.083
- Your hat, sir.
- Thank you.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.885
Oh, Mr. Dickens, it's such
an honor to meet you.

18:52.887 --> 18:55.389
- We just adore your books.
- No, we don't.

18:55.391 --> 18:59.026
- Well, <i>I</i> love them.
- Nonsense. You just like a good cry.

18:59.028 --> 19:02.062
What is it you particularly
object to in my books?

19:02.064 --> 19:05.097
Pickpockets, streetwalkers,
charity boys.

19:05.099 --> 19:07.100
Those people
don't belong in books.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.135
"Those people"?
You mean, the poor?

19:09.137 --> 19:12.005
Look here, Mr. Dickens.
I'm a self-made man.

19:12.007 --> 19:14.274
Pulled myself up
by my own bootstraps.

19:14.276 --> 19:17.844
Never asked for anything from anyone
that I wasn't willing to pay for.

19:17.846 --> 19:20.913
- Really? No help from anyone?
- None.

19:20.915 --> 19:24.788
Well, Papa did give us a very small
cotton mill when we were married.

19:27.189 --> 19:29.922
What do you suggest we do
with "those people"? Hmm?

19:29.924 --> 19:31.126
Are there no workhouses?

19:33.863 --> 19:36.263
Do you know how many people
would rather die than go there?

19:36.265 --> 19:38.065
Then they'd
better do it

19:38.067 --> 19:40.303
and reduce
the surplus population.

19:45.941 --> 19:47.576
Can you spare
a bob, please?

19:57.353 --> 20:00.557
Care to buy, sir?
Hard workers.

20:03.659 --> 20:05.124
Fit any chimney.

20:05.126 --> 20:07.196
You f...

20:14.435 --> 20:16.338
Quick!
Come on! In here!

20:19.909 --> 20:21.845
Down here now!

20:23.979 --> 20:25.459
- Come on!
- No!

20:35.190 --> 20:38.225
I lift mine eyes
unto the hills

20:38.227 --> 20:41.094
from whence cometh
my help.

20:41.096 --> 20:44.297
My help cometh
even from the Lord,

20:44.299 --> 20:46.533
who hath made
heaven and earth...

20:46.535 --> 20:50.437
All right, all right. I'm not paying
you by the hour. Skip to the end.

20:50.439 --> 20:53.206
Rest eternal, grant to him, O
Lord. Let light perpetual shine upon him.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.107
- Amen. Amen.
- Amen.

20:55.109 --> 20:57.009
Shame, innit?

20:57.011 --> 21:00.247
All that money and no one here to
mourn him except Old Scratch there.

21:00.249 --> 21:03.150
- Who's that?
- His business partner.

21:03.152 --> 21:05.952
The meanest cur on two legs,
so they say.

21:05.954 --> 21:07.890
Aye, right.
Come on.

21:45.227 --> 21:48.464
Ah... humbug.

21:58.507 --> 21:59.642
"Humbug."

22:03.545 --> 22:06.013
"Are there no workhouses?

22:06.015 --> 22:07.447
Well, then they'd
better do it

22:07.449 --> 22:09.649
and decrease
the surplus population."

22:09.651 --> 22:13.423
"Old Scratch.
All that money. Shame."

22:15.423 --> 22:17.790
Good evening, sir.

22:17.792 --> 22:19.127
Yes, it is,
Mrs. Fisk.

22:20.528 --> 22:22.528
- Charles?
- Humbug! Humbug!

22:22.530 --> 22:25.134
Humbug! Ha-ha!

22:31.773 --> 22:35.074
<i>It's about a businessman.
Or a factory owner. A miser.</i>

22:35.076 --> 22:39.179
<i>His partner dies. He doesn't shed a tear.
Thinks only of the money.</i>

22:39.181 --> 22:40.713
<i>And on
Christmas Eve...</i>

22:40.715 --> 22:44.351
On Christmas Eve,
he meets some kind of... of...

22:44.353 --> 22:48.154
of supernatural guides,
or spirits, possibly,

22:48.156 --> 22:50.257
who in the course
of one night

22:50.259 --> 22:53.794
teach him what a miserable,
loathsome, selfish toad he is.

22:53.796 --> 22:56.065
It's a short book.
Short and sharp.

22:57.199 --> 22:58.498
A hammer blow
to the heart

22:58.500 --> 23:01.069
of this smug,
self-satisfied age.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.375
It's a comedy.

23:09.377 --> 23:12.312
Brilliant.

23:12.314 --> 23:14.780
- Does it have a title?
- Yes.

23:14.782 --> 23:17.352
<i>Humbug: A Miser's Lament.</i>

23:20.689 --> 23:23.190
<i>A Christmas Ghost Story...
Christmas Song...</i>

23:23.192 --> 23:24.824
<i>Christmas Ballad.</i>
Something like that.

23:24.826 --> 23:28.828
Intriguing, really.
Ah, just one question.

23:28.830 --> 23:30.198
Why Christmas?

23:32.134 --> 23:34.534
- Well, why not?
- Does anybody really celebrate it anymore?

23:34.536 --> 23:37.170
Apart from our clerk, who
never misses an opportunity

23:37.172 --> 23:39.639
to take a day off...
with pay.

23:39.641 --> 23:43.776
More or less an opportunity for picking
a man's pocket every 25th of December.

23:43.778 --> 23:47.213
What we mean to say, Mr. Dickens, is,

23:47.215 --> 23:49.751
not much of a market
for Christmas books, what?

23:55.190 --> 23:59.625
It is a Christmas book because Christmas
is, or ought to be, the one time of year

23:59.627 --> 24:03.563
when men and women
open their shut-up hearts

24:03.565 --> 24:07.467
and think of people below them as if they
really were fellow passengers to the grave

24:07.469 --> 24:09.568
and not another race
of creatures altogether.

24:09.570 --> 24:11.837
We are already
halfway through October.

24:11.839 --> 24:15.174
Even if you had already written it, we
couldn't possibly get it illustrated,

24:15.176 --> 24:18.344
typeset, printed and bound,
advertised and distributed to shops

24:18.346 --> 24:19.816
in only six weeks.

24:22.483 --> 24:23.586
Well...

24:24.752 --> 24:26.585
thank you
for your opinion.

24:26.587 --> 24:27.690
Mr. Dickens!

24:31.593 --> 24:34.527
Tie it off now.
That's it.

24:34.529 --> 24:38.864
Scaly-headed vultures.
Money-grubbing, scum-sucking...

24:38.866 --> 24:41.567
- But, Charles...
- I'll do it myself.

24:41.569 --> 24:44.504
- What?
- I'll pay for it myself... all of it.

24:44.506 --> 24:46.672
Illustrations, everything.
I'll distribute it myself.

24:46.674 --> 24:50.209
But, Charles, this is madness.
Think of your finances, huh?

24:50.211 --> 24:52.379
Come on. We'll go back.
We'll renegotiate.

24:52.381 --> 24:54.280
No shame in it.
It's just business.

24:54.282 --> 24:57.449
Why throw everything away
for a minor holiday?

24:57.451 --> 25:00.353
No, I've never felt so strongly
about anything in my life, John.

25:00.355 --> 25:02.455
You can help me or not,
as you wish.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.824
- Where are you off to?
- Going to raise some capital.

25:04.826 --> 25:06.593
One thing I've learned
from my father...

25:06.595 --> 25:08.961
people will believe anything
if you're properly dressed.

25:08.963 --> 25:11.698
Mr. Trabb!
Your finest cravats!

25:19.607 --> 25:21.674
Ah.

25:21.676 --> 25:23.776
Nothing like the air
of the metropolis

25:23.778 --> 25:26.313
to put color in your cheeks,
eh, Mother?

25:37.226 --> 25:40.994
There you are, sir. Best quality.
A-1 condition.

25:40.996 --> 25:43.263
And look inside.

25:43.265 --> 25:45.334
Autographed
by the author.

25:47.536 --> 25:50.539
"To Papa. Love, Charles."

25:53.008 --> 25:55.644
Five bob.

25:56.644 --> 26:00.546
Hello, old dog.

26:00.548 --> 26:04.017
Perhaps we could,
um, strike a bargain.

26:04.019 --> 26:06.923
- Hello.
- Good with children, is it?

26:15.263 --> 26:16.565
Too much?

26:18.532 --> 26:21.934
Aha! Mr. Dickens
and Mr. Forster.

26:21.936 --> 26:24.270
How do you?

26:24.272 --> 26:26.408
Very well, thank you,
Mr. Haddock.

26:27.476 --> 26:28.874
Mittens.

26:30.578 --> 26:33.380
You are a bad boy.

26:42.023 --> 26:44.990
Now, how may I be
of service to you?

26:44.992 --> 26:47.459
Well, sir,
it's about the loan.

26:47.461 --> 26:50.398
There was something I wanted to tell you.
What was it?

26:51.799 --> 26:55.035
It was some rather good news,
if I recall correctly.

26:55.037 --> 26:56.670
What, uh...

26:56.672 --> 26:57.839
Ah.

27:00.409 --> 27:01.674
Biscuit?

27:01.676 --> 27:04.713
Well... thank you.

27:08.916 --> 27:10.019
Mmm.

27:11.586 --> 27:14.988
Ah! Uh, yes.

27:14.990 --> 27:17.590
Now, what was I, uh...
What...

27:17.592 --> 27:21.026
Uh, you said something
about good news?

27:21.028 --> 27:23.063
Possibly
about the lawsuit?

27:23.065 --> 27:25.731
Ah, the lawsuit.

27:25.733 --> 27:27.901
Yes, the copyright
infringement.

27:27.903 --> 27:30.636
<i>Oliver Twisted.</i> "As re-originated
from the original."

27:30.638 --> 27:33.038
Yes! Ha!
I have it here.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.644
Uh... Ah, yes.

27:36.644 --> 27:39.978
Good news indeed.
We won.

27:39.980 --> 27:42.882
The fine was set
at Â£2,200.

27:42.884 --> 27:45.117
2,200!

27:45.119 --> 27:47.720
The bad news is,
the defendants have no money.

27:47.722 --> 27:49.625
- Ah.
- Bankrupt.

27:50.726 --> 27:52.728
Disappointing, I know.

27:55.463 --> 27:58.030
But we'll have them arrested,
throw them into debtor's prison.

27:58.032 --> 27:59.599
No. No, no.

27:59.601 --> 28:00.803
No?

28:02.371 --> 28:03.806
As you wish.

28:04.705 --> 28:06.940
In the meantime,

28:06.942 --> 28:09.077
if you would be
so good...

28:16.718 --> 28:18.321
here's my bill.

28:24.125 --> 28:27.427
No rush.
Next week will be fine.

28:27.429 --> 28:28.995
Hmm.

28:28.997 --> 28:33.600
Tell you what. Why don't we
defer this until... January?

28:33.602 --> 28:36.469
And while we're at it, perhaps
you might add a little bit more.

28:36.471 --> 28:38.171
I'll make it
worth your while.

28:38.173 --> 28:39.674
More?

28:42.176 --> 28:44.413
You wish to borrow more?

28:47.048 --> 28:48.683
Not very much.
Just...

28:50.085 --> 28:53.486
Â£300...
till January.

28:53.488 --> 28:55.889
I think we can
increase your loan

28:55.891 --> 28:59.159
at, shall we say,
25 percent?

28:59.161 --> 29:00.696
God's teeth!

29:02.196 --> 29:03.465
Thank you.

29:07.836 --> 29:09.739
Charles.
Charles.

29:10.939 --> 29:12.838
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.606
Never better.

29:14.608 --> 29:16.745
Now find me
an illustrator.

29:23.117 --> 29:27.786
He was a tight-fisted,
hand to the grindstone

29:27.788 --> 29:31.557
old... Scratch.

29:33.662 --> 29:35.597
Scrounger.

29:36.565 --> 29:37.732
He was a...

29:39.134 --> 29:42.137
covetous old sinner.

29:44.038 --> 29:45.604
Name!

29:45.606 --> 29:47.006
Shh.

29:47.008 --> 29:49.642
Screwpull! Scrabbly.

29:49.644 --> 29:51.978
Name! Ah!

29:51.980 --> 29:53.846
Well, go on.
He won't bite.

29:53.848 --> 29:56.149
Screwpull.

29:59.221 --> 30:00.689
Aah!

30:16.938 --> 30:17.871
Scrimple!

30:17.873 --> 30:19.138
Aah!

30:19.140 --> 30:21.274
You're... What are you
doing in here?

30:21.276 --> 30:23.575
I've just come to see
to the fire, sir.

30:23.577 --> 30:26.578
I'm not to be interrupted under
<i>any</i> circumstances! Do you hear?

30:26.580 --> 30:29.681
I beg your pardon, sir.
It won't happen again.

30:29.683 --> 30:31.619
Wait. What's that
in your pocket?

30:38.692 --> 30:42.094
<i>Varney the Vampire,
or The Feast of Blood.</i>

30:42.096 --> 30:45.998
You won't tell Mrs. Fisk, will ya?
She'll think I was shirkin'.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.636
- Where did you learn to read?
- My mum taught me.

30:49.671 --> 30:51.069
But then she died

30:51.071 --> 30:53.074
and I had to go
to the Grubber.

30:54.576 --> 30:56.812
The workhouse?

31:00.048 --> 31:03.551
- Is it any good?
- Well, yes, sir. Thrilling.

31:05.987 --> 31:08.990
Tell you what.
I'll make you a trade.

31:12.693 --> 31:15.161
<i>Varney the Vampire</i>
for...

31:15.163 --> 31:16.895
Uh, where is it?

31:16.897 --> 31:19.567
Ah!

31:22.069 --> 31:24.170
<i>Aladdin
and His Magic Lamp.</i>

31:24.172 --> 31:26.038
Oh, my.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.240
Read it.
Let me know what you think.

31:28.242 --> 31:30.144
Thank you, sir.

31:33.914 --> 31:35.283
Hmm.

31:39.788 --> 31:41.621
Who is Scrimple?

31:41.623 --> 31:43.021
Hmm? Scrimple?

31:43.023 --> 31:45.924
- When I come in, you were saying...
- Oh!

31:45.926 --> 31:49.761
It's just a name
for a story I'm concocting.

31:49.763 --> 31:53.269
Get the name right and then, if you're
lucky, the character will appear.

31:54.935 --> 31:56.736
Hmm.

31:56.738 --> 31:57.972
He's not here yet.

31:59.974 --> 32:02.877
Scrantish?

32:04.945 --> 32:07.148
Scrarmer.

32:09.049 --> 32:10.382
Come on.

32:10.384 --> 32:13.686
Scrunge.

32:13.688 --> 32:15.622
Aw, come on!

32:15.624 --> 32:17.026
Come on,
you old sinner!

32:19.326 --> 32:20.996
Scrooge!

32:22.696 --> 32:26.132
Shut the window! Do you
think I'm made of money?

32:26.134 --> 32:28.634
Mr. Scrooge.

32:28.636 --> 32:32.037
- How delightful to meet you, sir.
- Sorry I can't say the same.

32:32.039 --> 32:34.774
Come now. Don't be standoffish.
We ought to be friends.

32:34.776 --> 32:36.742
- Don't have friends. Don't need 'em.
- Ah.

32:36.744 --> 32:38.878
Naturally.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.747
- I know. Let's play a game.
- Don't like games.

32:40.749 --> 32:42.748
Well, humor me.

32:42.750 --> 32:46.919
What do you think of when I
say the word... "darkness"?

32:46.921 --> 32:48.190
Cheap.

32:49.223 --> 32:51.125
- Love.
- Swindle.

32:52.794 --> 32:54.830
- Money.
- Security.

32:56.397 --> 32:58.965
- Children.
- Useless.

32:58.967 --> 33:01.070
- Workhouse.
- Useful.

33:04.172 --> 33:05.307
Christmas.

33:08.676 --> 33:10.111
Christmas?

33:11.413 --> 33:12.847
That's right.

33:17.117 --> 33:19.786
Help! Help! Get it away!

33:19.788 --> 33:21.754
Away!

33:23.424 --> 33:25.091
What is going on?

33:25.093 --> 33:26.992
Get it away,
the filthy thing.

33:26.994 --> 33:29.194
Come on, Grip, old chap.
Back in the cage.

33:29.196 --> 33:31.130
- Father?
- Ah. Charles.

33:31.132 --> 33:32.998
- Good day.
- What are you doing here?

33:33.000 --> 33:35.101
Well, we were
in the neighborhood

33:35.103 --> 33:38.203
and we thought we'd drop by with
a present for the children.

33:38.205 --> 33:40.273
His name is Grip.
He talks!

33:40.275 --> 33:42.808
- Can we keep him?
- Hello, old girl.

33:42.810 --> 33:45.077
It's bad luck, a bird in the house.
It means death.

33:45.079 --> 33:46.813
- Hello!
- Father, in here.

33:46.815 --> 33:48.717
Of course.

33:51.352 --> 33:54.319
Charles? Charles?

33:54.321 --> 33:56.988
What are you doing
back in London?

33:56.990 --> 33:59.491
My dear Charles.

33:59.493 --> 34:02.394
I will not disguise from you
that this is not the ardor

34:02.396 --> 34:04.396
with which a loving father
might be expected...

34:04.398 --> 34:07.100
You are supposed to be in Devon.

34:07.102 --> 34:08.333
Banishment!

34:08.335 --> 34:11.503
Be merciful
and say "death,"

34:11.505 --> 34:14.143
for exile has more
terror in its look.

34:15.342 --> 34:18.244
Father,
we had an agreement.

34:18.246 --> 34:19.945
Hmm?

34:19.947 --> 34:21.780
I bought you a house.

34:21.782 --> 34:24.016
I gave you an allowance.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.818
For which
I am very grateful.

34:26.820 --> 34:29.889
As for me, I'm happy
wherever the weather.

34:29.891 --> 34:33.762
But your mother is of
a more delicate sensibility.

34:34.795 --> 34:37.963
Charles,
the mere sight of cows

34:37.965 --> 34:40.234
causes her
actual physical pain.

34:41.402 --> 34:43.436
Father.

34:43.438 --> 34:46.340
And I have research to do
in the London Library.

34:49.010 --> 34:50.713
- Research?
- Oh, yes.

34:52.045 --> 34:53.945
Yeah.

34:53.947 --> 34:56.815
I have a commission
from <i>The Spectator</i>

34:56.818 --> 34:59.421
to write a feature
on the Bank Charter Act.

35:00.454 --> 35:02.487
The editor
was very impressed

35:02.489 --> 35:05.391
with my series
on marine insurance.

35:05.393 --> 35:09.929
Good for you, Father. I do hope that
you and Mother will stay here with us.

35:09.931 --> 35:13.068
The children and I will so enjoy
having some company in the evenings.

35:20.108 --> 35:22.277
<i>The Spectator.</i>
Well, that's, um...

35:23.478 --> 35:25.481
That's most impressive.

35:27.414 --> 35:29.817
Thank you, dear boy.

35:30.451 --> 35:32.150
Oh, by the way,

35:32.152 --> 35:34.420
you couldn't lend me
a tenner, could you?

35:34.422 --> 35:37.123
That blighter took my last
farthing for the cage.

35:42.429 --> 35:45.331
It was the bird, sir. It flew upstairs.

35:45.333 --> 35:50.302
Oh, um, I'll see
that it's all cleared up.

35:50.304 --> 35:53.005
Please, can we keep him?

35:53.007 --> 35:54.842
Well, I, um...

35:57.512 --> 35:59.481
Come on, Walter.

36:04.485 --> 36:07.523
"This is not the ardor
with which a loving father..."

36:11.893 --> 36:12.994
Humbug!

36:14.161 --> 36:16.497
- What is?
- Christmas.

36:19.434 --> 36:21.032
What about it?

36:21.034 --> 36:23.101
Well, what is it
but an excuse

36:23.103 --> 36:26.541
for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December?

36:28.376 --> 36:30.242
Yes. Keep going.

36:30.244 --> 36:33.445
A time for paying bills
without money.

36:33.447 --> 36:36.481
A time for finding yourself a year
older and not an hour richer.

36:38.385 --> 36:40.552
If I could work my will,

36:40.554 --> 36:43.121
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

36:43.123 --> 36:45.291
should be boiled
in his own plum pudding

36:45.293 --> 36:49.061
and <i>buried</i> with a stake of holly
through his heart, he should.

36:49.063 --> 36:53.999
Oh, Mr. Scrooge, you and I are
going to do wonderful things together.

36:54.001 --> 36:58.670
Oh, but he was a tight-fisted
hand at the grindstone, Scrooge.

36:58.672 --> 37:01.574
A squeezing, wrenching,

37:01.576 --> 37:05.211
grasping, scraping,

37:05.213 --> 37:08.014
clutching,
covetous old sinner.

37:10.018 --> 37:11.353
Charles?

37:14.588 --> 37:16.389
Hard at work?

37:16.391 --> 37:18.557
What can I help
you with, Father?

37:18.559 --> 37:22.461
Well, I was wondering if we might have
an extra candlestick for our room.

37:22.463 --> 37:24.429
- Of course.
- Oh!

37:24.431 --> 37:27.368
Cigars. Oh, yes.

37:28.469 --> 37:30.403
I must confess,

37:30.405 --> 37:35.273
I have acquired an irrepressible
habit of smoking whilst I write.

37:35.275 --> 37:36.708
Dreadful habit, I know,
but...

37:36.710 --> 37:38.613
Oh, yes.

37:39.947 --> 37:41.215
Thank you.

37:44.952 --> 37:46.485
Hmm. Going well?

37:46.487 --> 37:48.990
Oh.

37:50.324 --> 37:52.326
I won't detain you.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.508
Don't do that.
D-Don't.

38:09.510 --> 38:11.543
Why not?

38:11.545 --> 38:13.112
Too late.

38:15.349 --> 38:16.615
Who is it?

38:16.617 --> 38:18.120
Who is it?

38:19.554 --> 38:20.987
Bunsby?

38:22.623 --> 38:23.692
Clennam?

38:25.693 --> 38:28.427
Heep? Hexam?

38:28.429 --> 38:30.195
- Oh, stop, stop!
- Magwitch?

38:30.197 --> 38:31.299
No.

38:32.599 --> 38:33.701
Marley.

38:42.643 --> 38:45.577
Is that you, Jacob?

38:45.579 --> 38:47.746
- You know him?
- My business partner.

38:47.748 --> 38:50.516
Last time I saw him
he was dead as a doornail.

38:50.518 --> 38:53.219
How do you, Jacob?

38:53.221 --> 38:55.755
Business, business.

38:55.757 --> 38:58.724
Mankind was my business.

38:58.726 --> 39:01.296
The common welfare
was my business.

39:02.663 --> 39:04.132
Charity...

39:05.365 --> 39:06.568
mercy...

39:08.235 --> 39:10.135
forbearance,
and benevolence

39:10.137 --> 39:12.371
were all my business.

39:12.373 --> 39:15.240
He was never one
for a straight answer.

39:15.242 --> 39:17.309
And yet I practiced
none of them!

39:17.311 --> 39:19.077
Come in.

39:19.079 --> 39:20.414
Come in, please.

39:43.838 --> 39:47.175
You are fettered.
Why?

39:48.643 --> 39:51.612
I wear the chain
I forged in life.

39:54.849 --> 39:56.284
I made it...

39:58.286 --> 39:59.653
link by link,

40:01.222 --> 40:03.191
yard by yard.

40:04.759 --> 40:08.463
And of my own free will,
I girded it about me.

40:09.730 --> 40:12.530
Of my own free will,

40:12.532 --> 40:14.432
I wore it.

40:23.710 --> 40:27.415
Do you know the weight and length
of the chain you bear yourself?

40:29.550 --> 40:30.818
You mean him,
surely.

40:33.353 --> 40:35.156
Mm-mmm.

40:36.257 --> 40:37.659
You, Charley.

40:40.260 --> 40:43.130
Your chains,
all around you.

40:44.865 --> 40:47.335
Past and present...

40:49.137 --> 40:50.572
and what is to come.

40:55.409 --> 40:58.776
Hail to thee,
blithe turkey,

40:58.778 --> 41:01.246
whose exquisite odors

41:01.248 --> 41:04.349
now perfume
the circumambient air.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.720
And let this day
be fragrant

41:08.722 --> 41:12.258
with the love
we bear one another.

41:12.260 --> 41:15.360
And may God bless us,
every one.

41:15.362 --> 41:17.396
Every one.

41:22.269 --> 41:24.403
Mr. John Dickens.

41:24.405 --> 41:27.373
You're under arrest
for a debt of 42 pounds.

41:27.375 --> 41:28.606
- Father!
- Charley.

41:28.608 --> 41:30.744
Father,
tell them to stop!

41:31.878 --> 41:33.445
Take everything
that shines, boys.

41:33.447 --> 41:35.748
It's all right, Charley.

41:35.750 --> 41:38.617
- Tell them to stop, Father!
- It's all right.

41:38.619 --> 41:40.822
Please, Charley,
don't worry.

41:55.503 --> 41:57.936
What about Leech
for the illustrations?

41:57.938 --> 41:59.637
Leech?
He's so prickly.

41:59.639 --> 42:02.541
- And he's by no means the cheapest.
- I don't want the cheapest.

42:02.543 --> 42:05.778
Oh, Charles, for God's sake, slow down.
You move at railway speed.

42:05.780 --> 42:07.746
I don't want the cheapest.
I want the best.

42:07.748 --> 42:09.347
- It's going well then?
- What?

42:09.349 --> 42:11.749
- The book.
- It's brilliant. Best thing I've ever written.

42:11.751 --> 42:13.385
- What, so you...
- I've got 11 pages.

42:13.387 --> 42:15.787
- Eleven?
- Well, if it weren't for constant interruptions.

42:15.789 --> 42:18.990
We've got my father staying with us. He
could not have come at a worse time.

42:18.992 --> 42:20.492
Oh.

42:20.494 --> 42:21.896
Miss Wigmore.

42:24.297 --> 42:25.764
Ah.

42:25.766 --> 42:28.434
Come.

42:28.436 --> 42:29.668
Come along.

42:34.909 --> 42:36.809
Who was that?

42:36.811 --> 42:38.811
- Charlotte.
- Who?

42:38.813 --> 42:40.778
My fiancÃ©e.
I told you.

42:40.780 --> 42:42.947
FiancÃ©e?

42:42.949 --> 42:46.318
- She's a canny lass, is she not?
- Indeed. Most amiable.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.287
Amiable?

42:48.289 --> 42:51.257
Why, man, she's an
angel, a sylph.

42:51.259 --> 42:53.726
She's a goddess on a...

42:53.728 --> 42:56.528
Whatever is the matter?

42:56.530 --> 42:59.597
Charlotte and I have come
to a parting of the ways.

42:59.599 --> 43:02.034
- I thought you said you were engaged.
- We were.

43:02.036 --> 43:05.273
But then her father had no intention
for her to marry the son of a butcher.

43:07.275 --> 43:08.643
Here.

43:12.780 --> 43:14.947
Perhaps
it's for the best, eh?

43:14.949 --> 43:17.686
The life matrimonial, it's
not for everyone, old stick.

43:19.387 --> 43:21.222
Aye. Aye, no doubt.

43:22.422 --> 43:23.824
So... Leech.

43:24.791 --> 43:26.358
That's the ticket.

43:26.360 --> 43:27.825
Four wood cuts,
four etchings.

43:27.827 --> 43:29.394
The cover in red.
Hand-colored.

43:29.396 --> 43:32.298
The title in rustic,
spectral writing.

43:32.300 --> 43:34.432
The end papers to be green and
all three edges to be gilded.

43:34.434 --> 43:37.536
Gilded?
It'll cost you.

43:37.538 --> 43:40.539
Well, it must be exquisite.
That's why we came to you.

43:40.541 --> 43:43.976
You'll have to sell every
copy to make your money back.

43:43.978 --> 43:46.345
That is my intention.

43:46.347 --> 43:48.780
You brought
the manuscript?

43:48.782 --> 43:50.648
I'll have
something for you in a week.

43:50.650 --> 43:52.450
- A week?
- Mmm.

43:52.452 --> 43:54.820
That leaves only four weeks
to do all the illustrations

43:54.822 --> 43:56.891
and get it to the printer
in time for Christmas.

43:59.693 --> 44:02.927
- Can you do it?
- Mr. Dickens, I'm not a hired hand.

44:02.929 --> 44:05.466
I am an artist.

44:06.766 --> 44:08.602
What you are asking
is impossible.

44:09.836 --> 44:12.338
Impossible
for an ordinary man.

44:12.340 --> 44:14.742
But you are no ordinary man,
Mr. Leech.

44:15.543 --> 44:16.878
You are a genius.

44:20.681 --> 44:21.715
Fifty pounds.

44:22.650 --> 44:24.483
Paid in advance.

44:24.485 --> 44:27.021
Plus more
for the plates.

44:32.659 --> 44:35.062
Done.
Thank you, Mr. Leech.

44:37.731 --> 44:40.566
Look, Charles, I don't want
to be the voice of doom,

44:40.568 --> 44:42.934
but before we lay out
money for illustrations,

44:42.936 --> 44:46.373
we should consider what happens
if you don't finish on time.

44:47.141 --> 44:49.010
I <i>will</i> finish on time.

44:50.378 --> 44:51.846
Quite.

44:55.483 --> 44:58.516
Mr. Dickens. I fix the chandelier.
See?

44:58.518 --> 45:01.487
Yes. Good.
<i>Grazie,</i> Signor Mazzini.

45:01.489 --> 45:03.021
Is no problem.

45:03.023 --> 45:06.023
Only 12 guineas extra.

45:06.025 --> 45:08.494
Wh... Tw...

45:08.496 --> 45:11.829
I thought my father was off
to the British Library.

45:11.831 --> 45:14.833
Your sister's here, sir. Come from
Manchester with her little boy.

45:14.835 --> 45:15.936
Ah.

45:17.405 --> 45:19.938
- My dear sister! Ha-ha!
- Charley.

45:22.143 --> 45:23.742
Henry, how are you?

45:23.744 --> 45:25.878
Very well,
grace be to God.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.914
This cannot be young Master Henry.
I barely recognize you.

45:28.916 --> 45:31.483
- How old are you now?
- Nine, if you please, sir.

45:31.485 --> 45:33.918
Nine? I shall soon
run out of fingers.

45:39.793 --> 45:41.693
Excuse me, sir.

45:41.695 --> 45:44.829
The children are having their
tea in the dining room.

45:44.831 --> 45:46.701
Come on then, young 'un.
Up!

45:52.072 --> 45:53.575
Mind your head.

45:54.842 --> 45:56.874
There goes my heart.

45:56.876 --> 45:59.010
What did
the doctor say?

45:59.012 --> 46:00.848
He says we have to
wait and see.

46:01.849 --> 46:03.715
Won't you
let us help?

46:03.717 --> 46:06.552
- We'll manage.
- At least until Henry finds a new position.

46:06.554 --> 46:08.854
Something will come up.
I'm sure of it.

46:08.856 --> 46:11.190
You sound
just like Father.

46:11.192 --> 46:13.925
How is the old reprobate?

46:13.927 --> 46:17.662
"This morning I had 25 shillings in my
hand. And now, observe the vacancy."

46:17.664 --> 46:19.630
He means no harm.

46:19.632 --> 46:23.501
It's not enough. He bobs around
like a cork on the surface of life.

46:23.503 --> 46:25.670
- Not a thought for the future.
- Oh, Charley.

46:25.672 --> 46:28.507
Let it go, can't you?

46:28.509 --> 46:32.478
Come on, me army!
Me landlubbers, me lovelies!

46:32.480 --> 46:36.248
Oh! Up we go.
Ha-ha! Me landlubbers!

46:36.250 --> 46:40.586
Come aboard my ship!
Here we go! Let's set sail!

46:40.588 --> 46:43.921
Brail your capstan bar!
Come here, Walter.

46:43.923 --> 46:46.825
- Brail your capstan bar!
- No one is useless in this world...

46:46.827 --> 46:49.961
Who lightens the burden
of another. I know.

46:49.963 --> 46:54.199
For all his faults,
you won't find a kinder man.

46:54.201 --> 46:56.934
How long he is
growing up to be one.

47:00.173 --> 47:02.811
Here we go!
Full sail ahead!

47:11.952 --> 47:13.719
Why are you here?

47:13.721 --> 47:17.224
You'd better come and see
who's just turned up.

47:23.597 --> 47:24.932
Charles?

47:27.268 --> 47:29.967
Just a bit of indigestion.
Go back to sleep.

47:29.969 --> 47:31.472
Mmm.

47:49.722 --> 47:52.124
Tell him who you are.

47:52.126 --> 47:54.963
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Past.

47:58.097 --> 47:59.831
Follow.

47:59.833 --> 48:02.833
Not bloody likely.

48:02.835 --> 48:06.137
- Why not?
- Mucking around in the past? What's the point?

48:06.139 --> 48:07.905
You might learn something.

48:07.907 --> 48:10.775
Well, I already know
everything I need to know.

48:10.777 --> 48:13.744
- Uh, take him, why don't you?
- Me?

48:13.746 --> 48:16.315
- Yes, if you're so keen.
- It's not about me!

48:16.317 --> 48:19.253
Well, you're the author,
aren't you?

48:23.657 --> 48:24.992
Follow.

48:26.893 --> 48:30.996
Don't cry. We'll be back
when the debt's paid.

48:30.998 --> 48:35.099
- Why can't I stay with you?
- You're a big boy, Charley.

48:35.101 --> 48:37.034
You're the breadwinner now.

48:37.036 --> 48:40.738
You'll see.
It'll be an adventure.

48:40.740 --> 48:42.911
You'll hardly think of us at all.

48:44.811 --> 48:47.179
Time to go!

48:47.181 --> 48:49.213
Now, sir,
enough of that.

48:49.215 --> 48:51.083
Stand up tall.

48:51.085 --> 48:53.050
Blood of iron,
heart of ice.

48:53.052 --> 48:55.086
Huh?

48:55.088 --> 48:57.025
And remember!

48:58.257 --> 49:00.358
You're the son
of John Dickens!

49:00.360 --> 49:02.159
A gentleman!

49:02.161 --> 49:04.164
You be sure
and tell them that!

49:15.675 --> 49:16.777
Well, come on then!

49:18.846 --> 49:20.778
Blood of iron,

49:20.780 --> 49:22.182
heart of ice.

49:29.422 --> 49:32.157
- Good morning.
- What? Oh.

49:32.159 --> 49:34.392
You were tossing and turning
all night, you know.

49:34.394 --> 49:36.130
Yes. Bad dreams.

49:37.030 --> 49:39.331
What about?

49:39.333 --> 49:42.202
I don't know. Shadows.

49:43.836 --> 49:45.269
Well...

49:45.271 --> 49:47.371
a little daylight
will cure you.

49:47.373 --> 49:49.206
Now, Constable,

49:49.208 --> 49:52.043
shall we ask Mr. Punch where
the baby's daddy's gone?

49:52.045 --> 49:53.845
I bet he knows.

49:53.847 --> 49:57.349
- Oh! Where's the baby's daddy gone?
- Where's he gone, Mr. Punch?

49:57.351 --> 49:59.885
Daddy's off to prison!

49:59.887 --> 50:02.019
Off to prison? Oh-ho!

50:02.021 --> 50:05.057
Come on. We're wasting time.
Let's get to work.

50:05.059 --> 50:06.891
I <i>am</i> working.

50:06.893 --> 50:09.927
- Here?
- Yes. Gathering inspiration.

50:09.929 --> 50:12.097
Gathering what?

50:12.099 --> 50:16.200
- What do you see when you look around?
- Well, it's a market, you idiot.

50:16.202 --> 50:17.969
What else?

50:17.971 --> 50:21.238
Hot pies!
Eel, beef or mutton pies!

50:21.240 --> 50:23.378
- Buyers and sellers.
- What else?

50:25.244 --> 50:27.445
Never say die.
Have a look, sir.

50:27.447 --> 50:29.046
Thieves and ruffians.

50:29.048 --> 50:31.749
Highly interesting murder,
gentlemen!

50:31.751 --> 50:34.286
Hold! Hold!

50:34.288 --> 50:36.987
Clear the way!
Clear the way, lads!

50:36.989 --> 50:38.990
Mr. Fezziwig!

50:45.965 --> 50:47.798
Life, Mr. Scrooge.

50:47.800 --> 50:50.168
It's London. The great
theater of the world.

50:50.170 --> 50:52.436
- It's all here.
- Bah. Humbug!

50:52.438 --> 50:55.507
I'm a man of facts,
of calculations.

50:55.509 --> 50:57.943
Realities, not fancy.

50:57.945 --> 50:59.447
What the devil is that?

51:00.748 --> 51:02.016
Here you go, sir.

51:11.492 --> 51:13.992
- Must go.
- Where to?

51:13.994 --> 51:15.229
It's time to write.

51:24.204 --> 51:26.470
- Come along.
- Good night, children!

51:26.472 --> 51:29.143
Bye! Shoo!

51:34.782 --> 51:38.550
Well, looks as though Charles
won't be joining us. Again.

51:38.552 --> 51:40.519
- We may as well start.
- Oh.

51:40.521 --> 51:42.787
Ah, the parties.

51:42.789 --> 51:44.923
We used to keep such hours.

51:44.925 --> 51:47.858
Balls, dinners, champagne.

51:47.860 --> 51:50.028
First-rate capon,
Mrs. Fisk.

51:50.030 --> 51:52.798
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'll let the cook know.

51:52.800 --> 51:55.333
And the chairs
had turned legs,

51:55.335 --> 51:58.135
with green squabs
to match the curtains.

51:58.137 --> 52:00.005
What was that story,
Mother?

52:00.007 --> 52:04.075
Oh, I was just telling Kate about the
dining room set we used to have.

52:04.077 --> 52:07.512
Rosewood.
In the most approved taste.

52:07.514 --> 52:09.914
You mean the one
we pawned?

52:09.916 --> 52:11.449
Oh!

52:11.451 --> 52:16.086
Charles!
You are a satirical monster.

52:16.088 --> 52:18.255
- Is that a joke, Charles?
- Not a very amusing one.

52:18.257 --> 52:20.025
Is that a new waistcoat,
Father?

52:20.027 --> 52:25.229
What? Oh, yes. It's Persian crimson.
A little more expensive.

52:25.231 --> 52:28.532
But as I always say, people
will believe anything

52:28.534 --> 52:30.467
if you are properly dressed.

52:30.469 --> 52:33.905
Kate, will you ask Tara to bring
a tray up with something on it?

52:33.907 --> 52:36.842
- I'll bring it up.
- No. I need Tara to do it.

52:36.844 --> 52:39.577
I'll get her, sir.
Tara!

52:39.579 --> 52:42.414
That's the
spirit, my boy. Hmm?

52:42.416 --> 52:45.983
Procrastination is the thief of
time, eh, Charles?

52:45.985 --> 52:47.954
Collar him!

52:52.458 --> 52:54.291
We must not
disturb the poet

52:54.293 --> 52:56.628
when the divine frenzy
is upon him.

52:58.632 --> 53:00.534
Hmm.

53:10.210 --> 53:12.146
Know the place?

53:14.981 --> 53:17.018
Was I apprenticed here?

53:18.652 --> 53:22.519
Clear the way, lads! Clear the way.
It's Friday night.

53:22.521 --> 53:25.990
Why, it's old Fezziwig.

53:37.271 --> 53:39.271
Who is it?

53:39.273 --> 53:41.309
It's Tara, sir,
with your dinner.

53:48.315 --> 53:50.050
Tara.
Come in. Come in.

53:51.918 --> 53:53.621
Close the door.

53:56.123 --> 53:57.988
Sit. I want to
read you something.

53:57.990 --> 53:59.990
Oh... Oh, I... I don't think Mrs.
Fisk would...

53:59.992 --> 54:02.693
Ah! Skittleshins
to Mrs. Fisk.

54:02.695 --> 54:04.628
Come. Sit.

54:07.567 --> 54:09.700
Now, since you
like ghost stories,

54:09.702 --> 54:12.505
see if this can rival
<i>Varney the Vampire.</i>

54:15.275 --> 54:17.409
"With cherry-cheeked apples,

54:17.411 --> 54:20.679
juicy oranges,
luscious pears,

54:20.681 --> 54:23.715
immense Twelfth cakes
and seething bowls of punch

54:23.717 --> 54:27.184
that made the chamber dim
with their delicious steam.

54:27.186 --> 54:31.322
In easy state, upon this couch,
there sat a jolly giant..."

54:31.324 --> 54:33.590
- The second ghost.
- The second ghost.

54:39.132 --> 54:42.032
I am the Ghost
of Christmas Present.

54:42.034 --> 54:46.737
These are the gifts
of abundance, goodwill,

54:46.739 --> 54:48.405
and of generosity.

54:48.407 --> 54:50.240
Uh-huh.

54:50.242 --> 54:53.345
Of course, you wouldn't understand
much about that, would you?

54:53.347 --> 54:55.082
Unlike these good people.

54:57.617 --> 55:00.719
My dear Mrs. Cratchit, you have
outdone yourself this year.

55:00.721 --> 55:03.054
Oh, everyone pitched in.
Even Tim.

55:03.056 --> 55:05.358
- I set the table.
- Yes, you did.

55:08.027 --> 55:10.662
I didn't know Cratchit
had a crippled son.

55:10.664 --> 55:12.363
Didn't you ever think
to ask?

55:12.365 --> 55:15.266
A merry Christmas
to us all, my dears.

55:15.268 --> 55:18.139
- And may God bless us.
- God bless us, every one.

55:20.039 --> 55:23.240
He's my clerk. I don't pay him to
tell me about his personal life.

55:23.242 --> 55:25.642
- You hardly pay him at all.
- Fifteen shillings a week.

55:25.644 --> 55:28.545
For a man with a family,
not to mention a sick child?

55:32.485 --> 55:34.454
That's the market rate.

55:36.123 --> 55:39.090
Do you really believe
that every inch of existence

55:39.092 --> 55:41.492
is a bargain
across the counter?

55:41.494 --> 55:43.494
Observe this family.

55:43.496 --> 55:48.099
They don't have much, but they're happy,
grateful, contented with their lot.

55:48.101 --> 55:52.237
Whereas you are miserable
and content with nothing.

55:52.239 --> 55:54.738
Never heard such folly.

55:58.811 --> 56:01.315
Heed well what I've said.

56:02.416 --> 56:04.182
Farewell.

56:04.184 --> 56:06.187
And... intermission!

56:07.820 --> 56:10.789
- Thrilling performance.
- That's very kind. Thank you.

56:10.791 --> 56:13.995
And that is as far
as I've got.

56:19.365 --> 56:20.831
- Tara.
- Hmm?

56:22.668 --> 56:25.403
- How do you do that, sir?
- Do what?

56:25.405 --> 56:27.572
Make a world come alive.

56:27.574 --> 56:30.211
I could almost see
and hear them people.

56:31.844 --> 56:34.311
Especially that Tiny Tim.

56:34.313 --> 56:35.782
Poor mite.

56:45.759 --> 56:48.492
Um...
A word in your ear.

56:48.494 --> 56:52.130
- About what?
- The scene.

56:52.132 --> 56:55.867
- It's very one-sided.
- What? One-sided?

56:55.869 --> 56:58.506
Well, my character doesn't get
to explain his side of things.

57:00.773 --> 57:03.708
- So I've taken the liberty of writing a short speech.
- No.

57:03.710 --> 57:06.778
Something about the
rational self-interest...

57:06.780 --> 57:08.780
and the natural tendencies
of free markets...

57:08.782 --> 57:11.318
No. No. And no.

57:13.286 --> 57:15.153
Well, what sort of book
is this anyway?

57:16.489 --> 57:19.624
No! It's too... Ew.
It's too gloomy.

57:19.626 --> 57:21.793
The Ghost of Christmas
Present should be wonderful.

57:21.795 --> 57:23.862
Warm, jolly!

57:23.864 --> 57:25.796
- Jolly?
- Yes!

57:25.798 --> 57:27.632
A jolly ghost?

57:27.634 --> 57:29.135
That's it.

57:39.846 --> 57:42.313
- What's this?
- Find another artist.

57:42.315 --> 57:44.315
We don't want
another artist.

57:44.317 --> 57:48.586
A jolly Christmas ghost?
What's that mean?

57:48.588 --> 57:52.490
I can't draw
what I don't understand.

57:52.492 --> 57:56.360
Well, it is everything
that's best about Christmas.

57:56.362 --> 58:01.167
He's the soul of kindness
and generosity. He's...

58:02.434 --> 58:04.369
Well, he's Forster.

58:04.371 --> 58:05.936
Eh?

58:05.938 --> 58:08.208
With a beard.

58:12.512 --> 58:13.847
Come on. Jolly.

58:55.922 --> 58:58.856
In shops by Christmas?

58:58.858 --> 59:00.657
That'll be a miracle.

59:00.659 --> 59:02.594
Go away.

59:02.596 --> 59:06.766
Three flops in a row.
Up to your eyeballs in debt.

59:08.268 --> 59:10.534
I'd think you'd be glad
of some advice.

59:10.536 --> 59:13.237
So, you've had a few flops.
What of it?

59:13.239 --> 59:16.340
You're still young. It's not
as if you're an old man.

59:16.342 --> 59:18.378
You've still got lots of time to be...

59:45.405 --> 59:48.539
Are we in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?

59:51.411 --> 59:53.280
- Why doesn't he speak?
- Shh!

59:57.583 --> 01:00:01.985
You are here to show us the shadows
of the things that have not been,

01:00:01.987 --> 01:00:04.389
but will happen,
in the time before us.

01:00:04.391 --> 01:00:05.693
Is that so?

01:00:17.603 --> 01:00:19.336
Where does
it want us to go?

01:00:19.338 --> 01:00:21.241
I think I know.

01:00:25.311 --> 01:00:27.981
I have a bad feeling
about this. I...

01:00:34.788 --> 01:00:38.389
And then they entered
poor Bob Cratchit's house

01:00:38.391 --> 01:00:40.791
and found the mother and the
children round the fire.

01:00:45.532 --> 01:00:46.831
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:48.735
Then Bob came in the door.

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:58.809
You went today then,
Robert?

01:00:58.811 --> 01:01:01.047
To the cemetery?

01:01:02.414 --> 01:01:04.449
Yes, my dear.

01:01:04.451 --> 01:01:09.820
I wish you could have gone
to see how green a place it is.

01:01:09.822 --> 01:01:11.988
But you'll see it often.

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:16.764
I promised him that I would
take a walk there on a Sunday.

01:01:22.469 --> 01:01:24.371
My little child.

01:01:28.474 --> 01:01:30.007
- My little, little child.
- "...little child."

01:01:30.009 --> 01:01:32.008
- No!
- Uh, rude!

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:34.748
- Is Tiny Tim dead?
- Well, of course he is. Imbecile.

01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:38.115
He was very ill.

01:01:38.117 --> 01:01:39.883
You can't save
every child in London.

01:01:39.885 --> 01:01:42.519
And the family
has no money for a doctor.

01:01:42.521 --> 01:01:44.554
Then Scrooge must save him!

01:01:44.556 --> 01:01:45.591
Me?

01:01:47.059 --> 01:01:48.793
- But he wouldn't...
- Why?

01:01:48.795 --> 01:01:51.461
- Well, he's too selfish.
- He can change.

01:01:51.463 --> 01:01:53.530
There's good in him somewhere,
I know it!

01:01:53.532 --> 01:01:55.768
People don't change.

01:01:57.737 --> 01:02:00.104
He's been this way
for a long time.

01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:02.407
I'm not sure
he can change.

01:02:02.409 --> 01:02:05.112
Of course he can.
He's not a monster.

01:02:07.012 --> 01:02:09.479
I thought this was a ghost
story, not a fairy tale.

01:02:09.481 --> 01:02:13.016
He wouldn't let Tiny Tim die,
Mr. Dickens.

01:02:13.018 --> 01:02:15.853
He has a heart,
doesn't he?

01:02:15.855 --> 01:02:18.057
It would be
too wicked...

01:02:20.025 --> 01:02:21.961
even for him.

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:09.740
'Tis now the
very witching time of night...

01:03:09.742 --> 01:03:10.941
Hush!

01:03:10.943 --> 01:03:13.144
when graveyards
yawn and hell...

01:03:13.146 --> 01:03:15.947
Aha, Shakespeare.

01:03:15.949 --> 01:03:18.081
There's a man
who could write.

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:21.651
I doubt he ever
had a blockage.

01:03:21.653 --> 01:03:24.722
Self-preservation...
first law of nature.

01:03:24.724 --> 01:03:26.026
And that's
just a fact.

01:03:28.927 --> 01:03:30.728
Oh, hush.

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:33.164
Oh, Charles! Good evening.

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:35.199
We'll get him straight
into bed, Charles.

01:03:35.201 --> 01:03:39.036
We were up the river to Kew, and I
think perhaps it was too long a day.

01:03:39.038 --> 01:03:42.005
- Kew.
- Kew?

01:03:42.007 --> 01:03:44.608
- What about your newspaper article?
- Article?

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:47.177
Yes, the one you're writing.
It's been over a month.

01:03:47.179 --> 01:03:49.579
Oh!

01:03:49.581 --> 01:03:51.516
Oh, ho! Oh!

01:03:51.518 --> 01:03:53.818
No, the, um...

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:58.588
The editor felt that due
to pecuniary complications

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:00.791
of a most complicated
nature,

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:03.793
he felt he could not proceed
with the commission.

01:04:03.795 --> 01:04:05.595
So, no newspaper article.

01:04:05.597 --> 01:04:09.233
No. However,
I rejoice in saying

01:04:09.235 --> 01:04:12.637
I have every hope
something will turn up.

01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:15.541
I think it's time you went
back to Devon, Father.

01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:19.213
- Indeed.
- As soon as possible.

01:04:23.181 --> 01:04:25.749
Of course, dear boy.

01:04:25.751 --> 01:04:28.188
We shall catch the
afternoon train tomorrow.

01:04:31.791 --> 01:04:33.624
No, sweet.

01:04:33.626 --> 01:04:35.496
I can manage
from here.

01:04:36.329 --> 01:04:37.865
Thank you.

01:04:39.231 --> 01:04:41.201
Good night, Charles.

01:04:44.804 --> 01:04:48.204
Ride on, ride on,

01:04:48.206 --> 01:04:50.575
over all obstacles

01:04:50.577 --> 01:04:52.842
and win the race.

01:04:52.844 --> 01:04:55.211
Don't be unkind,
Charley.

01:04:55.213 --> 01:04:57.280
You don't know
what he's been through.

01:04:57.282 --> 01:05:00.184
He feels it all,
you know.

01:05:00.186 --> 01:05:04.124
He would never tell you,
but he feels it all.

01:05:23.742 --> 01:05:28.179
That's it. Blood of
iron, heart of ice.

01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:30.717
Now perhaps we can finish
this little book.

01:05:35.855 --> 01:05:39.289
"Are these the shadows
of the things that will be,

01:05:39.291 --> 01:05:42.328
or are they shadows of the
things that may be only?"

01:05:46.032 --> 01:05:47.901
That is as far
as I've got.

01:05:49.702 --> 01:05:52.003
It's brilliant.

01:05:52.005 --> 01:05:54.738
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No. No, of course not.

01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.177
Well, now...
that's encouraging.

01:06:00.179 --> 01:06:02.880
My... My one criticism...

01:06:02.882 --> 01:06:04.414
Yes?

01:06:04.416 --> 01:06:07.150
- Tiny Tim.
- Go on.

01:06:07.152 --> 01:06:10.021
- Are you really going to let him die?
- Aw, not you as well.

01:06:10.023 --> 01:06:13.190
It's a Christmas book.
Shouldn't it be hopeful?

01:06:13.192 --> 01:06:15.325
I mean, isn't that what... what...
what Christmas is all about?

01:06:15.327 --> 01:06:19.429
The hope that in the end, our
better natures will prevail?

01:06:19.431 --> 01:06:22.133
You were the one who persuaded
me to kill off Little Nell.

01:06:22.135 --> 01:06:23.767
Yeah. Well, I stand by
that decision.

01:06:23.769 --> 01:06:25.369
John, my readers
implored me...

01:06:25.371 --> 01:06:29.242
But this is different. If Tiny
Tim dies, then what's the point?

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:32.842
- Thank you, John.
- You're welcome.

01:06:32.844 --> 01:06:35.679
For reminding me why I never
ask your opinion on my work.

01:06:35.681 --> 01:06:38.014
Your services
are no longer required.

01:06:38.016 --> 01:06:39.950
- You cannot sack me.
- Why not?

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:43.019
Because I don't work for you.
I do what I do as a friend.

01:06:44.824 --> 01:06:47.124
John, please leave.

01:06:47.126 --> 01:06:50.760
See you on Friday.

01:06:50.762 --> 01:06:53.366
Last chapter's due
at the printers.

01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:05.976
Right. Let's run it again from the
scene with Scrooge's debtors.

01:07:05.978 --> 01:07:07.878
- Oh, what's the point?
- The point?

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.713
We keep stopping
at the same place.

01:07:09.715 --> 01:07:12.182
Yes, because
I'm working out the ending.

01:07:12.184 --> 01:07:14.851
- Admit it, you're blocked!
- I'm not blocked.

01:07:14.853 --> 01:07:16.122
Now, if you take
my advice...

01:07:17.824 --> 01:07:19.990
- I'm the author here.
- Allegedly.

01:07:22.494 --> 01:07:24.197
I'm going out.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.103
- Alone!
- Aw.

01:07:38.911 --> 01:07:40.744
Forster.
I need your help.

01:07:40.746 --> 01:07:43.416
- What is it? The children?
- No. The children are fine.

01:07:44.449 --> 01:07:46.249
What's this?

01:07:46.251 --> 01:07:50.186
"Candle-scandal, flirt-hurt,
Charlotte-poor heart."

01:07:50.188 --> 01:07:53.025
Is that a poem? That's atrocious.
What has got into you?

01:07:54.827 --> 01:07:57.327
You look terrible.
What's the matter?

01:07:57.329 --> 01:07:59.829
It's the book. I'm struggling
with one of the characters.

01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:02.768
Whoo-hoo! Ah!

01:08:06.873 --> 01:08:09.773
- Quite a few of them, actually.
- What exactly is the problem?

01:08:09.775 --> 01:08:15.146
The problem is, could a man as mean-spirited
as Scrooge, as evil as Scrooge...

01:08:15.148 --> 01:08:18.348
Could he become a different
person overnight?

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.152
What is so evil about him?

01:08:21.154 --> 01:08:23.254
- Well, he's a miser.
- Well, that doesn't make him evil.

01:08:23.256 --> 01:08:25.790
- It just makes him cheap.
- He worships money.

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:27.894
- It's the only thing that matters to him.
- Why?

01:08:30.328 --> 01:08:32.897
He has nothing else.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.801
No friends? No family?

01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:39.870
No one he trusts.

01:08:39.872 --> 01:08:41.471
Why?

01:08:41.474 --> 01:08:44.211
Because he's afraid.

01:08:45.511 --> 01:08:47.010
Of?

01:08:51.384 --> 01:08:53.216
Being found out.

01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:57.254
- Hello, chaps.
- Thackeray.

01:08:57.256 --> 01:09:01.357
Charles, I haven't seen anything
of yours in print for ages.

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.593
Don't tell me
you've had a blockage.

01:09:03.595 --> 01:09:06.996
Not in the least. I'm neck and
heels into a Christmas book.

01:09:06.997 --> 01:09:10.968
- What the deuce is that?
- A story about Christmas.

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:12.569
For Christmas.

01:09:12.572 --> 01:09:15.872
A story... about...?

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:18.008
How amusing.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:20.343
Well, best of luck with it.

01:09:20.345 --> 01:09:25.148
Oh, dear, my last book has
come out in a Railway edition.

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:27.483
Sold 10,000 copies,
in a week.

01:09:27.484 --> 01:09:30.019
"There's gold
in them thar hills,"

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.524
as your American friends
would say.

01:09:36.362 --> 01:09:39.865
Come on. Let's go somewhere
else, get a real drink.

01:09:48.006 --> 01:09:52.408
She's a big lass, and a bonny
lass, and she likes her beer.

01:09:52.411 --> 01:09:57.647
And I call her Cushie Butterfield,
and I wish she was here.

01:09:57.649 --> 01:09:59.950
What language is that?

01:09:59.952 --> 01:10:02.055
That's Geordie, man.
We're gods.

01:10:05.091 --> 01:10:07.391
- Where are we?
- Oh, it's Hungerford Stairs.

01:10:07.393 --> 01:10:08.895
Oi, I smell the river.

01:10:12.899 --> 01:10:14.932
What's that?

01:10:14.934 --> 01:10:16.599
It's a graveyard.

01:10:16.601 --> 01:10:20.336
Ah, it's the old Warren's Factory.
They moved from there years ago.

01:10:20.338 --> 01:10:22.339
I wonder they've not
pulled it down yet.

01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:25.142
Yeah.
Or burnt it down.

01:10:25.144 --> 01:10:27.111
Might do it myself
one day.

01:10:27.113 --> 01:10:29.382
Why? What have you got
against boot blacking?

01:10:30.115 --> 01:10:31.451
Charles.

01:10:32.284 --> 01:10:33.586
What is it?

01:10:35.154 --> 01:10:37.588
I just have
this recurring nightmare.

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:40.089
Oh, nightmares, aye.

01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:42.660
I've got one where I'm being
chased by a giant badger.

01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:46.932
What's yours?

01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:52.001
Never mind.

01:10:52.003 --> 01:10:54.338
Well, come on.
It's time to go home.

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.540
I'll see you at the printers.
Friday morning, nine o'clock.

01:10:56.542 --> 01:10:58.411
- I can't.
- Well, why not?

01:11:00.947 --> 01:11:04.214
It's the book.

01:11:04.216 --> 01:11:07.253
I can't... The characters
won't do what I want.

01:11:11.056 --> 01:11:12.690
And I'm afraid.

01:11:12.692 --> 01:11:15.159
Of what?

01:11:15.161 --> 01:11:18.361
If I can't finish it,
I'll never write again.

01:11:18.363 --> 01:11:21.598
Oh, come on, man, come on.
Have some sleep, hear?

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.136
I can't.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:28.272
The wrong fire
is burning in my head.

01:11:28.274 --> 01:11:31.040
Oh, don't be daft. Now, come on,
your wife will be worried sick.

01:11:31.042 --> 01:11:32.977
Who? Kate?
She doesn't understand me.

01:11:32.979 --> 01:11:36.245
I've got news for you, Charles.
None of us understand you.

01:11:36.247 --> 01:11:38.549
You're...
You're a freak of nature.

01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:41.652
I'm exhausted spending
two hours in your company.

01:11:41.654 --> 01:11:44.220
Come on, go home.
It's cold tonight, yeah?

01:11:44.222 --> 01:11:47.057
I'll see you Friday.

01:11:47.059 --> 01:11:50.760
<i>âª Oh, she's a big lass And a bonny
lass And she likes her beer âª</i>

01:12:03.175 --> 01:12:05.278
Here. Bye.

01:12:12.551 --> 01:12:14.454
Put that one over there!

01:12:21.092 --> 01:12:23.160
Boys!

01:12:23.162 --> 01:12:26.562
This here
is Charley Dickens.

01:12:26.564 --> 01:12:29.201
And what was you just telling me, lad?
About your dad?

01:12:36.341 --> 01:12:38.107
My father
is a gentleman.

01:12:38.109 --> 01:12:41.178
Where is he then?

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:44.380
- Dining with the queen?
- I heard he's been sent to prison.

01:12:44.382 --> 01:12:46.383
Hush, you lot.
Get back to work!

01:12:46.385 --> 01:12:47.385
Master Dickens.

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:50.756
No shirkin' here.

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:57.229
You're no better than us, cocker,
and you'd best learn that.

01:13:31.162 --> 01:13:33.563
You.
What are you doing?

01:13:33.565 --> 01:13:35.799
Hello, Charley, old boy.

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:38.201
Father?
What are you doing here?

01:13:38.203 --> 01:13:41.871
Oh, I had some business that I had
to attend to, so I thought...

01:13:41.873 --> 01:13:44.741
You just left town. What business
could you possibly have?

01:13:44.743 --> 01:13:46.579
- Oh, I...
- What's that?

01:13:49.614 --> 01:13:51.117
You're going
to sell this?

01:13:52.451 --> 01:13:54.518
Well, it's no good to you,
is it?

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.820
Is that what
you've been doing?

01:13:56.822 --> 01:13:59.755
Going through the rubbish like a
tramp, selling bits and pieces of me.

01:13:59.757 --> 01:14:02.692
Is this your business?

01:14:02.694 --> 01:14:06.196
- Aren't you ashamed?
- What?

01:14:06.198 --> 01:14:09.732
I bought you a house.
I gave you an allowance.

01:14:09.734 --> 01:14:11.835
What more can you
possibly need?

01:14:11.837 --> 01:14:16.240
Need?
Oh, reason not the need.

01:14:16.242 --> 01:14:19.175
- You see me here, you gods?
- No. No. Shh. No.

01:14:19.177 --> 01:14:21.711
- A poor old man!
- No! Shh! Stop it.

01:14:21.713 --> 01:14:27.617
Charley, you don't know what it's
like to be poor, to be nothing.

01:14:27.619 --> 01:14:30.320
At 11 years old
I was made to know.

01:14:30.322 --> 01:14:32.889
Working 12 hours a day,

01:14:32.891 --> 01:14:37.427
going hungry,
alone and afraid

01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:40.464
because your father, who is
supposed to care for you,

01:14:40.466 --> 01:14:42.532
is so utterly
thriftless!

01:14:42.534 --> 01:14:44.634
No, please.
I beg you.

01:14:44.636 --> 01:14:46.702
No, you are not
the victim here.

01:14:46.704 --> 01:14:48.738
This is about me and your
family and all of us

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:52.209
who've lived our whole lives in
the shadow of your recklessness.

01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:55.312
Charley...

01:14:55.314 --> 01:14:59.549
Go away. I am sickened
at the sight of you.

01:14:59.551 --> 01:15:03.219
You are nothing but a drag
and chain upon my life.

01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:05.589
I owe you nothing. Go!

01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:06.893
Ah, Charley.

01:15:36.689 --> 01:15:38.455
- Who's that then?
- Nobody.

01:15:38.457 --> 01:15:40.257
- The author.
- Huh.

01:15:40.259 --> 01:15:42.261
No wonder he looks
so depressed.

01:15:47.699 --> 01:15:49.900
Right. That's enough.
Back to work.

01:15:49.902 --> 01:15:52.001
God bless us,
every one.

01:15:52.003 --> 01:15:54.338
Why are you so miserable?

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:57.273
What else can I be, when I live
in such a world of fools as this?

01:15:57.275 --> 01:15:59.543
- You mean-spirited, cynical...
- Oh, yes?

01:15:59.545 --> 01:16:01.544
Well, you look
in the mirror sometime.

01:16:01.546 --> 01:16:03.379
"Is that a new candle, Kate?"

01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:05.415
"Your services
are no longer required."

01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:08.684
Ah, a hypocrite.

01:16:10.622 --> 01:16:12.421
- What?
- Pardon me, sir.

01:16:12.423 --> 01:16:14.391
- Mrs. Dickens just wanted me to ask...
- This is intolerable.

01:16:14.393 --> 01:16:18.894
- Mrs. Fisk! Mrs. Fisk!
- Yes, sir?

01:16:18.896 --> 01:16:22.734
Take this child away from here and see that she
never disturbs me ever again. Do you hear?

01:16:23.969 --> 01:16:26.471
Yes, sir.
Come with me, girl.

01:16:27.905 --> 01:16:30.906
Oh, yes. Banish her.
Banish them all.

01:16:30.908 --> 01:16:33.643
- Quiet!
- Humanity's great benefactor.

01:16:33.645 --> 01:16:35.379
- Humbug!
- Shut it.

01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:37.848
Or I'll make you bald,
with bad teeth.

01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:40.616
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
It won't change a thing.

01:16:40.618 --> 01:16:42.688
You still won't have an ending.

01:16:48.426 --> 01:16:50.693
This is ridiculous.

01:16:50.695 --> 01:16:52.966
You're all being ridiculous.

01:17:00.506 --> 01:17:03.973
If you be a man!

01:17:03.975 --> 01:17:06.677
Come on then, coward!

01:17:06.679 --> 01:17:08.512
Fight me!

01:17:08.514 --> 01:17:10.714
You miserable old fool!

01:17:10.716 --> 01:17:13.620
Fight me! Come on!

01:18:01.699 --> 01:18:03.099
Tara.

01:18:03.101 --> 01:18:05.305
Tara!

01:18:07.939 --> 01:18:09.805
Has anybody seen Tara?

01:18:09.807 --> 01:18:12.808
- She's gone.
- You asked Mrs. Fisk to send her away.

01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:15.911
Well, go and search for her.
Find her.

01:18:15.913 --> 01:18:18.482
Rehire her at once.

01:18:18.484 --> 01:18:23.786
An Irish orphan in London? That would be
like looking for a needle in a haystack.

01:18:23.788 --> 01:18:27.523
Come on, out. Come on,
children, off you go.

01:18:27.525 --> 01:18:29.561
Quick sticks.
That's it.

01:18:31.462 --> 01:18:33.129
Why didn't you
stop her?

01:18:33.131 --> 01:18:35.766
How was I to know you didn't mean it?
You said...

01:18:35.768 --> 01:18:39.402
I say a lot of things that are
nonsense when I'm working.

01:18:39.404 --> 01:18:43.173
- Charles...
- You know how ideas take possession of me.

01:18:43.175 --> 01:18:47.579
- You knew what I was like when you married me.
- Yes. I did.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.818
But you have no idea
what it's like to live with you.

01:18:54.118 --> 01:18:55.951
Always walking
on eggshells,

01:18:55.953 --> 01:18:57.853
trying to guess your mood,

01:18:57.855 --> 01:19:00.859
to know which of your commands are
a whim and which are in earnest.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.730
You know, sometimes I...

01:19:06.564 --> 01:19:09.598
I feel your characters
matter more to you

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.703
than your own flesh and blood.

01:19:19.778 --> 01:19:21.114
I am who I am.

01:19:23.047 --> 01:19:25.581
And who is that?

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:28.018
It's as if
there are two of you.

01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:30.920
One who's kind and gentle,

01:19:30.922 --> 01:19:33.190
and a secret self

01:19:33.192 --> 01:19:35.927
that no one is allowed
to know or question.

01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:58.141
<i>This here
is Charley Dickens.</i>

01:20:58.143 --> 01:21:01.680
<i>What was it you was telling me,
lad, about your dad?</i>

01:21:03.681 --> 01:21:06.016
<i>My father is a gentleman.</i>

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.620
<i>Where is he then?
Dining with the queen?</i>

01:21:10.622 --> 01:21:12.621
<i>I heard he's
been sent to prison!</i>

01:21:12.623 --> 01:21:15.825
<i>Hush, you lot! Where's your manners?
Get back to work.</i>

01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:17.760
<i>Master Dickens.</i>

01:21:17.762 --> 01:21:20.229
<i>Got a present
for the young gentleman,</i>

01:21:20.231 --> 01:21:22.935
<i>seeing as it's Christmas.</i>

01:21:33.145 --> 01:21:35.678
Blood of iron,
heart of ice.

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.282
<i>You're no better
than us, cocker!</i>

01:21:44.221 --> 01:21:46.889
Hello, Charley.

01:21:46.891 --> 01:21:51.061
So, this is
your miserable secret.

01:21:51.063 --> 01:21:55.365
The famous author,
the inimitable Charles Dickens,

01:21:55.367 --> 01:21:59.969
was once a scabby
little factory boy.

01:21:59.971 --> 01:22:01.705
Leave me be.

01:22:01.707 --> 01:22:05.642
A common bit of riffraff,
a squalid wretch.

01:22:05.644 --> 01:22:08.247
No use to anyone!

01:22:20.024 --> 01:22:23.893
Look for yourself.
What do you see, huh?

01:22:23.895 --> 01:22:27.964
A nothing. A nobody.
A debtor's son.

01:22:27.966 --> 01:22:30.202
Who could ever care
for you?

01:22:32.871 --> 01:22:36.805
Certainly not your father.
He abandoned you.

01:22:36.807 --> 01:22:39.776
Enough of that.
Stand up tall.

01:22:39.778 --> 01:22:41.314
Blood of iron,
heart of ice.

01:22:42.847 --> 01:22:44.750
He failed you again and again.

01:22:47.019 --> 01:22:48.019
Oh!

01:22:51.055 --> 01:22:52.888
You said so yourself.

01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:56.795
Nothing but a drag and chain
upon your life.

01:22:58.162 --> 01:22:59.764
Who are you? Huh?

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.336
You know me, Charley.

01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:08.838
I'm hunger. I'm cold.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.775
I'm darkness.

01:23:12.444 --> 01:23:17.350
I'm the shadow on your thoughts,
the crack in your heart,

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:22.154
and the stain upon your soul.

01:23:23.755 --> 01:23:26.891
And I will never,
ever leave you.

01:23:29.293 --> 01:23:30.860
Go away.

01:23:30.862 --> 01:23:32.965
Why? We're having such fun.

01:23:33.998 --> 01:23:35.831
People don't change, Charley.

01:23:35.833 --> 01:23:40.035
Look around you. You're
still the same scabby boy.

01:23:40.037 --> 01:23:42.707
Useless,
just like your father.

01:23:45.342 --> 01:23:46.878
No.

01:23:49.146 --> 01:23:52.851
"No one is useless in this world who
lightens the burden of another."

01:23:54.786 --> 01:23:57.155
My father
taught me that.

01:24:08.265 --> 01:24:10.135
Which grave is that?

01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:15.273
- There's no name on it.
- Well, why should there be?

01:24:17.175 --> 01:24:19.308
The man to whom
this grave belongs

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:21.279
never made himself useful
to anyone but himself.

01:24:22.747 --> 01:24:24.513
No friends.

01:24:24.515 --> 01:24:26.051
No family.

01:24:27.752 --> 01:24:30.689
Never felt love or joy.

01:24:32.224 --> 01:24:34.694
Never took any kind
of pleasure in life.

01:24:43.033 --> 01:24:45.304
And now it's too late.

01:24:46.771 --> 01:24:49.207
It's time, Mr. Scrooge.

01:24:50.307 --> 01:24:52.310
We've come to the end.

01:25:20.372 --> 01:25:23.109
I don't want to die.

01:25:24.376 --> 01:25:26.375
Not like this...

01:25:26.377 --> 01:25:29.178
alone,

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.082
unloved, forgotten.

01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:34.349
It's too late.

01:25:34.351 --> 01:25:36.419
No, it's never too late.

01:25:36.421 --> 01:25:39.291
It's never...
It's never too late.

01:25:46.264 --> 01:25:49.464
I will honor Christmas
in my heart

01:25:49.466 --> 01:25:51.934
and try to keep it
all the year.

01:25:51.936 --> 01:25:55.205
I will live in the past,
the present, and the future.

01:25:55.207 --> 01:25:58.974
The spirits of all three
will strive within me.

01:25:58.976 --> 01:26:03.248
I will not shut out
the lessons that they teach.

01:26:04.882 --> 01:26:07.485
Oh, please. I beg you.

01:26:10.855 --> 01:26:13.958
Let me do some good...

01:26:15.961 --> 01:26:18.361
before I die.

01:26:24.402 --> 01:26:26.538
So we come
to the final chapter.

01:26:30.942 --> 01:26:33.912
Oh, I told you we'd do great
things together, Mr. Scrooge.

01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:02.006
<i>Stave five.</i>

01:27:03.408 --> 01:27:05.211
<i>"The End of It."</i>

01:27:08.212 --> 01:27:10.679
<i>Yes. And the bedpost
was his own,</i>

01:27:10.681 --> 01:27:15.117
<i>the bed was his own,
the room was his own.</i>

01:27:15.119 --> 01:27:18.858
<i>Best and happiest of all, the time before
him was his own to make amends in.</i>

01:27:20.926 --> 01:27:22.558
<i>Scrooge was better
than his word.</i>

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.294
<i>He did it all
and infinitely more.</i>

01:27:25.296 --> 01:27:28.263
<i>And to Tiny Tim,
who did not die,</i>

01:27:28.265 --> 01:27:30.666
<i>he was a second father.</i>

01:27:30.668 --> 01:27:33.436
<i>And so,
as Tiny Tim observed,</i>

01:27:33.438 --> 01:27:36.208
<i>"God bless us, every one."</i>

01:27:39.411 --> 01:27:40.945
<i>The end.</i>

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.617
The end.

01:27:52.524 --> 01:27:54.389
- Charles?
- What?

01:27:54.391 --> 01:27:56.558
- There is someone here to see you.
- Not now, Kate, please.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.230
I have to get this to the
printer by nine o'clock.

01:28:07.706 --> 01:28:09.240
Tara.

01:28:10.274 --> 01:28:11.643
Thank you for the loan.

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.548
Well, thank you.

01:28:18.716 --> 01:28:20.184
It's good, isn't it?

01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:26.522
Oh, yes, sir.
It was fizzing.

01:28:26.524 --> 01:28:29.662
Fizzing?
That's delightful.

01:28:32.262 --> 01:28:33.631
Tara.

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:39.535
I am very sorry that I sent you away.
That was a mistake.

01:28:39.537 --> 01:28:41.106
And I was...

01:28:44.309 --> 01:28:46.209
And you were right
about Tiny Tim.

01:28:46.211 --> 01:28:48.076
He doesn't die.

01:28:48.078 --> 01:28:50.679
Scrooge helps him
to get better.

01:28:50.681 --> 01:28:53.318
And does he help Scrooge
get better too?

01:28:56.453 --> 01:28:58.620
Yes.

01:28:58.622 --> 01:29:01.326
Yes, he does.

01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:08.563
- Where did that come from?
- A gift.

01:29:08.565 --> 01:29:11.701
For the children.
From your father.

01:29:11.703 --> 01:29:13.635
My father was here?

01:29:13.637 --> 01:29:17.173
You can still catch him, if...

01:29:17.175 --> 01:29:18.510
Oh!

01:29:21.345 --> 01:29:23.147
Kate.

01:29:26.384 --> 01:29:28.683
I know.
You don't deserve me.

01:29:28.685 --> 01:29:31.055
Go. Go.

01:29:36.261 --> 01:29:38.197
- Cab!
- Whoa!

01:29:39.663 --> 01:29:41.630
- Paddington Station!
- Right-o, governor.

01:29:41.632 --> 01:29:44.002
- As fast as you can!
- Oi! Oi!

01:29:48.105 --> 01:29:49.504
Whoa!

01:29:49.506 --> 01:29:52.375
Turn it around.
And wait for me here!

01:29:52.377 --> 01:29:54.343
Oi! Stop!

01:29:54.345 --> 01:29:56.144
- Hey!
- Stop! Police!

01:29:56.146 --> 01:29:58.080
Wait!

01:29:58.082 --> 01:30:00.482
Wait, wait, please! Where
do you think you're going?

01:30:00.484 --> 01:30:02.652
- What?
- Oh, please, dear.

01:30:02.654 --> 01:30:06.822
- Don't make a scene. We're going away.
- No, you're not. Please.

01:30:06.824 --> 01:30:09.692
Police! Get out of my way! Clear the way!
Let me through!

01:30:09.694 --> 01:30:12.160
Oh.
What have I done now?

01:30:12.162 --> 01:30:14.597
No, it's...
it's what you haven't done.

01:30:14.599 --> 01:30:18.701
- What do you mean?
- Well, who's going to carve the turkey?

01:30:18.703 --> 01:30:21.403
And who's going to make
the Christmas pudding?

01:30:21.405 --> 01:30:23.438
It won't be the same
without you.

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:27.643
The pudding! The secret is
to warm the treacle first.

01:30:27.645 --> 01:30:29.812
There, you...
You see, my dear?

01:30:29.814 --> 01:30:32.581
I told you something
would turn up.

01:30:32.583 --> 01:30:35.119
Oh, my son. Oh.

01:30:36.453 --> 01:30:37.789
Gotcha!

01:30:39.323 --> 01:30:41.257
You're that Charles
Dickens, aren't you?

01:30:41.259 --> 01:30:42.458
Uh, guilty.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:45.160
That last one.
<i>Chuzzlewit.</i>

01:30:45.162 --> 01:30:47.796
Wept like a baby, I did.

01:30:47.798 --> 01:30:50.433
Well, that's... That's very kind.
What's your name, Constable?

01:30:50.435 --> 01:30:52.805
My name?
Copperfield, sir.

01:30:53.837 --> 01:30:55.737
Copperfield.

01:30:55.739 --> 01:30:57.807
Any chance
of a new book soon?

01:30:57.809 --> 01:30:59.677
New book. New book!

01:31:00.878 --> 01:31:03.812
Wait. New book.

01:31:03.814 --> 01:31:05.317
Merry Christmas!

01:31:06.751 --> 01:31:09.188
I'm his father.

01:31:10.622 --> 01:31:12.354
Santa bells for sale!

01:31:12.356 --> 01:31:15.327
Shoe Lane!
As fast as you can go.

01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:24.634
- Charles, where have you been?
- It's all right. I've got it!

01:31:24.636 --> 01:31:28.403
Mr. Grub!
Mr. Grub. We're here.

01:31:28.405 --> 01:31:31.810
I have it. I have the ending.
You can finish it now.

01:31:33.444 --> 01:31:35.577
- It's too late.
- What?

01:31:35.579 --> 01:31:38.748
Oh, come on. You've already printed the other
four chapters, and it's just one more.

01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:41.185
Get the whole book
finished today.

01:31:46.256 --> 01:31:49.491
- I can't guarantee anything.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Grub!

01:31:49.493 --> 01:31:51.295
Thank you.

01:31:52.462 --> 01:31:54.233
I didn't say
I could do it.

01:32:08.246 --> 01:32:10.582
Well, I'll see
what I can do.

01:32:21.359 --> 01:32:23.629
Oh, come on, man.
Don't prolong the agony.

01:33:13.011 --> 01:33:14.713
It's exactly
as I'd imagined it.

01:33:20.417 --> 01:33:23.652
Hello, gents. Extraordinary
weather, isn't it?

01:33:23.654 --> 01:33:25.588
Looks like snow.

01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:28.958
- Hello, Thackeray.
- Oh, what's this I have?

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:31.861
Yes. It's a proof copy
of your new book.

01:33:31.863 --> 01:33:35.498
I'm going to review it
for <i>The Spectator.</i>

01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:38.834
I'm told you wrote it
in only six weeks, Charles.

01:33:38.836 --> 01:33:40.838
What a prodigy you are.

01:33:46.377 --> 01:33:48.643
Did you bring that
all the way from Italy?

01:33:48.645 --> 01:33:49.981
<i>SÃ¬. Venezia.</i>

01:33:51.048 --> 01:33:52.947
And now...

01:33:52.949 --> 01:33:58.086
And now the beautiful mermaid
floats through the sea.

01:33:58.088 --> 01:34:01.859
Wooo!

01:34:11.469 --> 01:34:13.639
Hello, old girl!

01:34:15.372 --> 01:34:17.940
Oh, my goodness.
That is beautiful.

01:34:17.942 --> 01:34:20.576
Isn't it? The Germans
call it a Tannenbaum.

01:34:20.578 --> 01:34:23.446
It's a tree for Christmas.
A Christmas tree, I suppose.

01:34:23.448 --> 01:34:26.081
Now the royal family have got
one, it'll be all the rage.

01:34:28.953 --> 01:34:31.387
- Hello.
- Miss Wigmore!

01:34:31.389 --> 01:34:32.990
Papa had
a change of heart.

01:34:34.591 --> 01:34:37.893
So he did. Oh, I'm so pleased!
Congratulations.

01:34:37.895 --> 01:34:40.396
Charles, uh, I think you're
going to want to hear this.

01:34:40.398 --> 01:34:41.897
- It's by Thackeray.
- Not now.

01:34:41.899 --> 01:34:44.036
No, please.
Everyone, gather round.

01:34:53.677 --> 01:34:56.010
"It was a blessed inspiration

01:34:56.012 --> 01:35:00.915
that put such a book into
the head of Charles Dickens.

01:35:00.917 --> 01:35:04.387
A happy inspiration
of the heart

01:35:04.389 --> 01:35:07.889
that warms every page.

01:35:07.891 --> 01:35:13.728
It is impossible to read without a
glowing bosom and burning cheeks,

01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:18.701
between love and shame
of our kind."

01:35:18.703 --> 01:35:20.463
- Aw.
- Bravo, Charles.

01:35:23.841 --> 01:35:25.775
Well, uh...

01:35:25.777 --> 01:35:29.081
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

01:35:31.716 --> 01:35:33.952
And those on the way.

01:35:35.752 --> 01:35:37.553
A toast.

01:35:37.555 --> 01:35:42.525
I wish you all many,
many happy Christmases

01:35:42.527 --> 01:35:47.862
and friendships, and great
accumulation of cheerful recollections

01:35:47.864 --> 01:35:50.499
and heaven at last
for all of us.

01:35:50.501 --> 01:35:54.573
In the season of hope, we will shut
out nothing from our firesides

01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:57.843
and everyone
will be welcome.

01:36:06.451 --> 01:36:10.154
Welcome what has been
and what is

01:36:11.756 --> 01:36:13.923
and what we hope may be,

01:36:13.925 --> 01:36:15.924
to this shelter
underneath the holly.

01:36:22.934 --> 01:36:26.235
Merry, merry Christmas
to one and all.

01:36:26.237 --> 01:36:28.739
Merry Christmas!

01:36:57.268 --> 01:36:58.804
Thank you.
