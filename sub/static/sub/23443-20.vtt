You know, I charge
by the nautical mile.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.475
- This is fine right here.

19:40.712 --> 19:43.614
So long, sister.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.219
What are you lookin' at?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.153
- Nothing.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.221
Ah, I don't want
any trouble.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.557
- Keep your yap shut
and you won't get any.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.525
Now row.

19:55.494 --> 19:57.795
[bird caws]

19:59.665 --> 20:00.631
Hmm?

20:00.633 --> 20:01.532
[gasps]

20:01.534 --> 20:02.700
[thunder crashes]

20:02.702 --> 20:03.734
[gasps]

20:03.736 --> 20:04.602
[screams]

20:04.604 --> 20:06.204
[breathing heavily]

20:06.206 --> 20:06.737
Lucy!

20:06.739 --> 20:07.905
- Hey, Lola.
Glad you're here.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.576
I just drew the ace of wands,
which means you're going--

20:11.578 --> 20:12.476
- Never mind that.

20:12.478 --> 20:13.878
We need to barricade the door.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.246
Help me move this dresser.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.582
- Uh, want to tell me
what's going on?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.217
- [sighs]
Okay.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.852
I took your creepy doll
and then I broke her

20:21.854 --> 20:23.554
and now she's haunting me.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.555
I'm so sorry, Lucy.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.656
You told me not to touch her,

20:25.658 --> 20:27.858
and I should have
listened to you.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.628
- You broke her?

20:30.630 --> 20:31.796
She looks fine to me.

20:31.798 --> 20:35.800
- Uh, that--yeah,
that's not your doll.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.268
That is!

20:37.270 --> 20:38.169
[thunder crashes]

20:38.171 --> 20:40.504
- Whoa, how did you
even do this?

20:40.506 --> 20:42.840
- Well, it began
as a simple tea stain,

20:42.842 --> 20:45.910
and then things kind of
progressed from there.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.513
[sighs]
I'm a terrible sister.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.581
- No, you're not.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.415
I forgive you.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.618
It's not like you
did this on purpose.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.885
- Thank you, Luce.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.753
You're really nice.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.490
So can you please get her
to stop haunting me and stuff?

20:59.492 --> 21:00.758
- She was probably
just haunting you

21:00.760 --> 21:03.461
because you took her away
from her rightful owner.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.629
Now that
you've given her back,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.831
I'm sure
she'll leave you alone.

21:06.833 --> 21:07.598
- Phew.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.899
Well, that's a relief.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.869
And sorry again for wrecking
your doll and stuff.

21:11.871 --> 21:12.737
- Wrecking her?

21:12.739 --> 21:14.772
Now that I know
she can haunt people,

21:14.774 --> 21:16.641
I like her even better.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.643
- Of course she does.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.212
[mouse squeaks]
[frog croaks]

21:21.214 --> 21:23.414
- Whoa, guys, wrong way!

21:23.416 --> 21:25.283
[frog croaks]

21:25.285 --> 21:25.950
Sorry, Lynn.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.385
I'm still training 'em.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.019
- No big.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.621
They probably smell
the sandwich I left down there.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.489
[mouse squeaks]

21:31.491 --> 21:34.992
Whoop, looks like Lola's doll
got out of our room again.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.627
- That's not Lola's.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.928
That's Lucy's.

21:37.930 --> 21:38.763
- It is?

21:38.765 --> 21:40.264
Oh, well, I feel like a dummy,

21:40.266 --> 21:42.700
'cause I kept finding it
in all these weird places

21:42.702 --> 21:43.968
and returning it to our room.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.436
First it was
in the crawl space,

21:45.438 --> 21:48.239
then buried in the backyard,
then at the dump.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.775
I even found it at the bottom
of Tall Timbers Pond

21:50.777 --> 21:52.810
when I was visiting
my fish friends.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.713
- Weird, how'd it get
to all those places?

21:55.715 --> 21:56.781
- I don't know, Lynn.

21:56.783 --> 21:57.848
How do boogers get made?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.917
Some stuff is
just unexplainable.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.385
- Yeah, true that.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.587
- Hey, you guys better share!
