00:02.520 --> 00:05.280
-So how much do you normally
put in? Is that all right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08.080 --> 00:10.520
Really get it in there.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.960
That's it. See what you've
done there, that's good.
You got the flick right.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.320
-Pukka.
-Yeah. If you need
any help, here's a...

00:18.200 --> 00:21.560
-OK. Yeah, OK.
-See that? I'll
pop that there for ya.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.040
-Oh, shit.
I've found a grey hair.
-Grey hair? What?

00:25.080 --> 00:27.600
-Where?
-Shall I pull 'em out?

00:27.640 --> 00:30.320
"Them"? You just said it was a
grey hair. What d'ya mean, them?

00:30.360 --> 00:33.560
No, I reckon embrace it,
like silver fox, Lineker-style.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.280
Lineker! He's bollocks
comparing to me.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.080
Jesus Christ! We need to sort
this out. It's my wedding day.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.880
OK, just don't get
all hot and bothered,
cos the gel's gonna run.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.400
Fuck's sake! Lineker?

00:44.440 --> 00:47.480
Clooney, if anything.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.320
Check the bathroom,
see if there's any hair dye.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.120
Hello, guys. You all right?
How are ya? I'm best man,
by the way,

00:55.160 --> 00:58.520
just in case you didn't know.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Take a seat.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.080
And if you are religious,
please kneel on the cushions.
Thank you.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.280
<i>Grindah chose me
to be his best man...</i>

01:04.319 --> 01:07.240
which means I'm better
than everyone at the wedding.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.040
-Well, apart from me, mate.
-Yeah, apart from Grindah,
obviously.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.280
How you doing, Paul?
It's Grindah's dad.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.200
He's well safe. Cameraman,
come on, you need to get
a photo of my and Grindah's dad.

01:17.240 --> 01:21.000
Yeah, go on, you can just...
There you go.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.240
-Cheers. See ya in a bit.
-Lovely, all right.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.800
-See ya.
-Nice one.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.160
Can't wait to bang
this bit out.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.520
This is the best bit. The
beginning of your whole life.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.120
For you, because you don't
really have a life, innit?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.520
<i>Listen, no one gives a shit
about some weird church
where you're going,</i>

01:34.560 --> 01:37.880
"Meh, let's, like, sing hymns
and do weird promises and that."

01:37.920 --> 01:41.280
-The main bit ain't the God bit,
the main bit's the after party.
-Yeah.

01:41.320 --> 01:46.520
<i>Grindah did this proper clever
thing, where instead of having
a wedding after party,</i>

01:46.560 --> 01:50.440
he was, like, dead that, let's
have the Kurupt FM daytime rave.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.520
Exactly. So think about it.
Not only are we gonna have
all the ravers and that there,

01:54.560 --> 01:56.880
but you're gonna have all
the wedding guests as well.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.200
It's got the potential to be
one of our biggest sets to date.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.280
Probably get a shit load of
bookings off the back of this.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.600
It's a very special day for us.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.560
-[director] I see you're
looking forward to it.
-[both] Yeah.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.199
No sign of Miche, no?

02:10.240 --> 02:12.000
-I'm calling her now.
-Sweet.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.240
What's going on
with your hair, anyway?

02:14.280 --> 02:16.880
-Nothing going on with my hair.
-Straight to voicemail.

02:16.920 --> 02:20.120
If there's anything wrong
with my hair, it's cos Beats
done it instead of Miche.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.080
-Oh, yeah, that must be it, man.
-Yeah, it is it, man!

02:24.600 --> 02:26.480
So mouthy.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.400
-She ain't picking up.
-Leave a message.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.160
-Shall I call back?
-Call back, leave a message.

02:32.200 --> 02:36.200
Say it's an emergency.
Say something horrible's
happened or something.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.040
Hi, Michelle. It's, er, Kevin.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.640
Unfortunately, your nan's
had a slight stroke.

02:44.680 --> 02:49.440
So if you can get down here
as quick as possible, that'd
be great. Thank you.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.680
How's my shininess?
Do we need a bit more powder?

02:51.720 --> 02:53.600
-No, it's fine.
-Hold on.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.880
Where's Roche? She's meant
to be my Maid of Honour.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.600
<i>One of the biggest surprises
on the wedding day is what
the bride looks like.</i>

02:59.640 --> 03:02.560
And obviously you look
your very best in white,
it shows off your tan.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.240
Please don't mess up my hair.
I don't want anything else to
go wrong. It's taken so long.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.240
In my dreams, I'll go in
and Grindah will just weep.

03:09.280 --> 03:14.240
<i>I just want him to cry. I just
want him to see that I look so
beautiful it hurts his eyes.</i>

03:19.800 --> 03:24.640
<i>You know, he can barely say
his vows because he's just
so overcome with emotion.</i>

03:28.120 --> 03:30.920
[Chabsie] Control it,
Stevie. Calmly, calmly.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.520
[Miche] Oh, my God, fuck off!

03:33.560 --> 03:36.560
Grindah got a pony!
You got the pony!

03:36.600 --> 03:39.000
-Yeah.
-I cannot wait to marry you!

03:39.040 --> 03:42.720
-Same, so hurry up.
-Sorry, we did discuss this.
You need to be on that side.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.920
I'll do the walk again.
I'd prefer the photos to be on
that side, if that's all right.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.560
-What's going on?
-OK, so we're gonna reset,
guys. Is that OK?

03:48.600 --> 03:51.320
-Yeah.
-[Chabsie] OK, turn
the pony round, Stevie.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.640
-No worries.
-Yeah.

03:53.680 --> 03:57.000
-It's quite a tight space
for it to turn.
-Flick its head.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.640
Well, my dream was always
to have a pony at the wedding,

03:59.680 --> 04:03.040
cos it's quite, like,
a religious symbol,
isn't it, the pony?

04:03.080 --> 04:06.040
Jesus got on the horse
and rode to the Cross
and that kinda thing.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.760
I want that at the wedding, so
you're really in touch with God.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.640
And also it just looks
good in the photos.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.440
-Turn her. You turn.
-Come on, everyone stand up!

04:13.480 --> 04:17.120
["Wedding March" plays]

04:18.160 --> 04:20.240
-Are you smiling?
-Oh, yeah.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.640
[Grindah] Fuck, yeah,
she looks banging.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.040
[Chabsie] Easy, easy.

04:27.080 --> 04:30.400
-Can he go up stairs?
-Yeah, he can go up stairs.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.720
-Are you sure?
-Can he go down stairs? Don't
wanna get ourselves in trouble.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.240
Right, everyone sit down,
come on! Thank you.

04:36.280 --> 04:39.120
You look different.
Have you dyed your hair?

04:39.160 --> 04:42.720
Nah, it's cos I used
different gel, so that's
probably what it is.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.240
-Well, you look stunning.
-Ah, come on, look at you.
You do too.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.760
-Ah, thank you.
-Let's just bang this out as
quick as we can though, yeah?

04:49.800 --> 04:50.840
Yeah.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.520
First, I'm required to ask

04:54.560 --> 04:59.160
if anyone knows of any reason
why these persons should
not be married?

04:59.200 --> 05:02.120
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.480
Can we just speed this up?
Cos I've got some DJs
coming down in a bit.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.640
-Yeah, cool.
-OK, all right?

05:07.680 --> 05:09.960

Take you, Anthony Zografoff.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.600
-"Zografos" is the correct...
-Zografos.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.960
How about you just let us say it
without having to repeat it?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.760
-Cos it will save on time
that way, innit?
-Cut out the middle man.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.200
I want the priest, cos God
signs it off, doesn't he, so...

05:33.240 --> 05:37.000
-So we need her.
-All right then, well, let's
just speed it up, if you can.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.080
-Can we just go for it?
-Push the set time back
20 minutes.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.000
-OK, cool.
-Please repeat after me.

Carry on. You guys keep them
on, it's fine. Ah, right,
so let's go.

-[Beats] No!

-Ssh! Keep it down. Ready and...
-Could we have the rings,
please?

06:06.440 --> 06:08.560
Yeah, sure.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.720
-You're on.
-One ring to rule them all!

-Come on, hurry up.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.600
Yeah, I know.
Down on your knee.

-On my knee?
-Yeah.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.720
-Go on.
-OK.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.360
-No, I don't...
-Thank you.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.480
-And then, slide that one.
-Cheers.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.520
Ah! Thanks, mate.
Lovely, wasn't it?

06:28.560 --> 06:32.720
And by the power vested in me
and by the Church of England,

06:32.760 --> 06:35.480
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.320
-Ah, thank God for that.
-Oh, my God,
it's actually official!

06:38.360 --> 06:40.600
[cheering and applause]

06:40.640 --> 06:43.760
OK, everyone,
settle down, please.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.040
Thanks very much everyone
for putting up with that.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.040
We are running a little
bit behind schedule,

06:48.080 --> 06:49.920
so if you can get out of
here as quick as you can,

06:49.960 --> 06:51.800
bang out some photos and
straight to the main event.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.040
-[Beats] Thank you!
-Thank you. Keep it Kurupt.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.200
Amen. Let's go people.
Watch your backs.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.200
-Come on, everyone out. Get out!
-[Grindah] Carol, hurry up.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.800
It's not all about you,
you old slag. [laughs]

07:03.840 --> 07:06.360
-Where are you going?
-I'm just gonna get the bucket.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.320
Get the bucket,
it's gonna shit everywhere.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.280
[director]
Where did the pony come from?

07:11.320 --> 07:13.280
Chabuddy G can get you
whatever you want, mate.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.640
If you want a pony, I'll get you
a bloody pony. Look at that.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.760
When it drops, it's gonna
be a bloody epic shit, mate.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.520
She's due one any minute.
She had a McDonald's
on the way here.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.120
I don't judge. You wanna pony,
I'm not gonna ask what for,
you know?

07:28.160 --> 07:32.400
Up to you, mate. I look
the other way, as long as
I get my, you know?

07:32.440 --> 07:36.520
As long as I get paid, mate, you
can fuck a pony, I don't care.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.080
Eat some grass if you want.

07:41.440 --> 07:46.080
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
the bride and groom,
Miche and Grindah!

07:46.120 --> 07:48.880
[cheering]

07:51.240 --> 07:54.280
But not in the eye,
not in the eye!

07:54.320 --> 07:56.480
Oh, kick him while he's down!

07:56.520 --> 07:58.680
And then stomp the balls in!

07:58.720 --> 08:01.680
[director] What do you expect
then from Beats as best man?

08:01.720 --> 08:05.800
I need him to make sure whenever
there's a minute where it's
boring, he brings it back up.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.680
I need him to be organised.
I need him to be on the ball.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.400
-Filofax.
-Filofax, if he needs one, like.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.080
-You got the gold mic
for later, yeah?
-Yeah, man, of course.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.760
Sweet. Good man.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.480
Steves, come on,
I need to chat to you.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.760
I fucking left Grindah's
gold mic at the station
and we need it for the party.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.800
-Shit! You left his gold mic?
-Yeah.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.120
-I could run back to radio.
-Please, yeah.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.240
Get Beats in. Where's Beats?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.440
All right, sweet. I'll meet
you there in a minute.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.400
-Thanks, Steves.
-Beats?

08:38.440 --> 08:41.039
-Sorry, guys.
-Steves, we'll get
you in in a minute.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.400
I've just gotta run back
to radio. I left something on.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.040
-What?
-I left something on!
I think the oven's on.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.400
Do you want the bridesmaids
in on this one as well?

08:49.440 --> 08:51.960
Yeah. Angel, come on,
let's get some more pictures.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.720
Ah, yeah, Angel can, yeah.
Put your arm around me.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.840
-You're not in this one.
-Great.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.000
-So they can see you, all right.
-Come in a little bit closer.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.520
[Miche] <i> The photos</i>
<i>are really important,</i>

09:00.560 --> 09:03.200
<i>cos there'll definitely be
magazines and newspapers
wanting to buy</i>

09:03.240 --> 09:06.480
all the pictures up,
or websites, you know,
whoever wants them, really.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.960
Miche, is it not a bit morbid,
by a gravestone?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.920
Three, two, one.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.840
But I definitely think
that some people want them,

09:13.880 --> 09:17.040
cos it's a big moment for me
and the music industry.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.000
-Miche, come on.
-Did you get it?

09:19.040 --> 09:22.120
-Mum, you take pictures easy.
-What are you doing?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.560
-How long are you gonna be?
-Five minutes.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.040
Address is on the flyer, so...

09:27.080 --> 09:30.400
Also, set times have been
pushed back, so quick as
you can, people.

09:30.440 --> 09:35.640
Hello, gorgeous.
Who's a gorgeous girl?
Yeah, are you waving?

09:35.680 --> 09:37.760
-Oh, getting on so well.
-Clever girl.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.040
I'll just take her back from
you at the next venue, yeah?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.640
No, you're all right.
Do you wanna go back to Mummy?

09:43.680 --> 09:47.360
Look at that, no response.
Yeah, she's happier with you.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.000
Dirty federalies.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.360
Fucking hell!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.680
What the fuck are they doing?
Outside the flat, innit?

10:08.160 --> 10:10.120
Better get out.
It's the fucking feds.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.720
-Get in the house to get
the rest down there.
-Fucking hell!

10:12.760 --> 10:15.960
Fucking come downstairs! You're
so big with your massive camera.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.640
-Does anyone wanna
take the baby?
-Why ain't she with the baby?

10:18.680 --> 10:21.800
-Have you seen Roche?
-Come on.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.040
-Can you get the door for me?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.400
-Come on, quick as you can.
-We're leaving.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.560
-Gotta get it all in,
so give me a hand.
-Exactly. Quick as you can.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.120
-Oh, thank you.
-Ah!

10:32.160 --> 10:35.640
-Come on, mate.
-Oh, shit, I didn't think
you were getting in.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.000
-You normally get in the front.
-Yeah, it's all that traditional
bollocks though, innit?

10:39.040 --> 10:42.880
-Yeah.
-You're my lovely,
gorgeous hubby, aren't you?

10:42.920 --> 10:45.920
-Come and give wifey a kiss.
-OK. [laughs]

10:47.520 --> 10:49.320
Aaah!

10:49.360 --> 10:52.040
-Come on, Decoy.
-All right.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.840
[Tanya] Wait, wait, guys!
Guys, where is Roche?

10:57.680 --> 10:59.640
Whoa, Nellie!

10:59.680 --> 11:02.120
Come on, you. Good girl.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.920
Ah, look at you. I used to
have a pony when I was little.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.560
Hey. Well...

11:06.600 --> 11:09.800
<i>♪ Let's do it, ride it ♪</i>

11:09.840 --> 11:11.880
<i>♪ My pony ♪</i>

11:11.920 --> 11:14.000
-[they laugh]
-Is that a song?

11:14.040 --> 11:16.120
Yeah, it's about riding a pony.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.360
But I think it's
a metaphor, actually.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.360
I think in the song
the pony is his penis.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.160
-Oh, right.
-But in this case I'm
talking about my actual pony.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.280
Or whichever you prefer,
you know?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.160
[Chabsie] Weddings are a really
great place to find love.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.880
There's a lot of older women
there, starting to get broody,
lowering their standards.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.880
Their biological clock
is ticking. Time is
running out for them

11:36.920 --> 11:39.280
and I'm just there
to remind them of that.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.480
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
"Hi, Chabuddy."

11:44.080 --> 11:48.200
[police chatting indistinctly]

11:48.240 --> 11:52.000
-I think that's the lot.
-Come on, let's go.
That's enough of this.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.600
Jesus!

12:01.640 --> 12:03.320
-What, we're here already?
-Come on, Decoy.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.840
-Up to the corner, mate.
-Up to the corner, Decoy.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.120
Up to the corner, Decoy!

12:08.960 --> 12:11.760
-[Miche] Lot of people here,
aren't there?
-Fair people.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.400
-Easy, boys.
-Easy.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.440
-Who are they?
-Two of my mates, isn't it?

12:15.480 --> 12:17.520
Well, you are so popular,
aren't you? Love it.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.160
People only go to weddings
cos they have to.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.640
So I'm trying to switch
that vibe up for my team.

12:22.680 --> 12:26.080
I want people to want it, like,
"I can't wait for
the wedding next Friday."

12:26.120 --> 12:27.960
Like, you'd say about a rave.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.840
-Miche?
-Oh!

12:29.880 --> 12:33.320
Craig David sort of shit.
Everyone got their flyers, yeah?

12:33.360 --> 12:36.160
<i>And then they can go to
the wedding, deal with
all the bollocks</i>

12:36.200 --> 12:39.120
<i>and then go to the after party
and just go, "Sick!"</i>

12:39.160 --> 12:41.480
<i>And then all they remember
from that wedding...</i>

12:41.520 --> 12:43.080
is how sick Kurupt FM were.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.160
[gasps] Oh, my God!

12:46.200 --> 12:50.120
-Fucking sick, innit?
-Ah, it's perfect.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.760
Hold on, did you just say
perfect? Wait till you see
what else I got.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.440
Personalised cake. I've done
a few additions as well.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.280
-It's stunning.
-[Carol] Wow, Miche,
that is nice, innit?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.440
-So nice, innit? Three tier.
-The bridegroom only looks
like Decoy, don't he?

13:02.480 --> 13:04.480
-No, not really.
-Yeah, he does.

13:04.520 --> 13:08.120
Always said if you didn't marry
Decoy, I will. Innit, Decoy?

13:08.160 --> 13:10.440
-That's inappropriate for today.
-Looks nothing like Decoy.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.480
-I've got the
Mediterranean colouring.
-Hair feels a bit different.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.200
So, do you guys want an hand?

13:16.240 --> 13:17.960
-It's fine, honestly.
-You sure?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.240
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.120
What are you gonna play, then?

13:22.160 --> 13:24.560
Do it a bit of bhangra
if you want. [laughs]

13:24.600 --> 13:27.040
All right, yeah. I'm up
for anything, you know me.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.240
-You know that, Decoy, don't ya?
-Yeah, all too well.

13:30.280 --> 13:33.640
All right, babe. I got
no gag reflex, you know?

13:34.600 --> 13:36.040
Yeah.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.400
Our people are
all coming in now.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.960
-Who are they?
I don't know her, do I?
-There's free food and that.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Thank you. Good.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.160
-Have you got a flyer?
-What, if we didn't,
would you not let us in?

13:48.200 --> 13:51.480
-Everyone needs a flyer, Roche.
-Sorry about all that bit, like,

13:51.520 --> 13:54.120
waiting out there, but it's
gonna be popping off soon, yeah?

13:54.160 --> 13:56.720
-Will we go and find mummy?
-Thank you.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.080
-Is your wife in there?
-Have you got a flyer?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.760
Are you joking? I'm standing
here holding your baby.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.680
-No flyer, no entry,
that's the policy.
-No, where is your wife?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.320
Hi, thank you, cheers.

14:06.360 --> 14:11.720
Where's your mummy? Where
is she? Where did she go?

14:11.760 --> 14:14.160
[director]
So are you a fan of weddings?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.760
I'm not a massive fan
of weddings, no.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.440
They are a good place
to dump your baby on to
other people though, so...

14:20.480 --> 14:24.880
I've given her half a banana.
I don't even know what to do.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.600
-Goodness.
-Do you wanna?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.600
Yes.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.960
We actually said that this is
gonna be our last one together.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.400
-Babies are proper
draining, innit?
-Yeah!

14:34.440 --> 14:37.240
-All right, go to Craig.
-[baby cries]

14:37.280 --> 14:39.800
Oh, there we go. Good.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.240
Are they from the bar
downstairs? Can we get...

14:42.280 --> 14:46.720
-Nah, listen, they're
all bloody fans of yours.
-It's weird cos it's my wedding

14:46.760 --> 14:50.840
-and I don't know who the people
are, it feels so funny.
-They think you're beautiful.

14:50.880 --> 14:54.080
-[director] Do you know
everyone at the reception then?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.200
Everyone at the reception
are all my friends and...

14:57.240 --> 15:00.480
We had the family at the first
bit, friends come later

15:00.520 --> 15:03.000
-for the rave party
sort of thing.
-Reception.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.160
Reception. Yeah, rave reception.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.520
Sorry about all the weird
wedding shit. The rave's
gonna pop off soon.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.680
-You've met some...
-What, they were your mates?

15:10.720 --> 15:14.520
No, exactly. I can't have mates
and not know them.

15:14.560 --> 15:18.600
-Quite strange,
it's our wedding.
-No! [laughs]

15:18.640 --> 15:21.760
[Steves sighs]
Look at this.

15:21.800 --> 15:26.040
We ain't done anything wrong.
It's just everything.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.440
Grindah's gonna be
fuming about this.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.440
Sick. Still got the whiteboard.

15:32.480 --> 15:35.560
So at least we know
what we're doing.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.520
All around you there's people
that are trying to get you

15:38.560 --> 15:42.200
and you always have to be
thinking about that, so you have
to make sure you're secure.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.640
You've gotta make sure, when
you're in the street, you're
ready to run at any time.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.040
Yes!

15:49.720 --> 15:52.840
Too clever for 'em.
Hid it in the safe.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.840
<i>It's the way it is. You get
caught slipping, they will
take everything they can.</i>

15:56.880 --> 15:58.160
Fuck!

16:00.200 --> 16:03.080
All my nan's money's gone.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.880
They've taken it.

16:05.920 --> 16:09.560
All right, we just gotta go.
We got the mic, let's
just fucking...

16:09.600 --> 16:13.080
Bill a zoot on the way.
Just block it out.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.680
[whispers to himself]

16:15.720 --> 16:18.840
<i>Being a best man,
it's a big responsibility.</i>

16:18.880 --> 16:21.320
-Fast and furious...
-Kevin, mate.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.880
-You're needed upstairs.
-Is it?

16:23.920 --> 16:28.960
<i>And I get nervous talking
to people that I've never
spoken to before.</i>

16:29.000 --> 16:32.600
-Can I get a picture?
-Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.880
To be honest, writing
a best man's speech is, like,

16:35.920 --> 16:38.520
probably one of the hardest
things I've ever done.

16:38.560 --> 16:43.000
Er, first of all, I just wanted
to apologise to everyone

16:43.040 --> 16:45.760
that didn't realise
this was a wedding thing.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.840
Just bear with us, yeah?
I've prepared a few words.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.000
So here goes.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.560
When we first met,
I knew you would be,

16:56.600 --> 17:00.520
my best mate and the best
MC in the galaxy.

17:00.560 --> 17:05.359
<i>Putting my feelings
about Grindah</i>

17:05.400 --> 17:08.040
<i>into lyrics that rhyme...</i>

17:08.079 --> 17:10.760
Yeah, I have told him
it doesn't have to rhyme.

17:10.800 --> 17:15.640
-Yeah, but, everything sounds
better when it rhymes, Roche.
-Does it?

17:15.680 --> 17:19.599
Dealing with radio beefs,
putting Angel to sleep.

17:19.640 --> 17:24.599
The power of our friendship
is fast and furious levels
of deep. Yeah?

17:24.640 --> 17:28.079
-Mm. Yeah.
-I know you'll be happy,
your family too,

17:28.119 --> 17:31.600
because every family
needs a leader like you.

17:31.640 --> 17:35.280
Erm... So give me a bell
whenever you need me.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.600
You're the best mate
I could ever have.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.640
Sincerely yours, Colonel Beatty.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.680
-[trickle of applause]
-Thank you. To Grindah!

17:44.720 --> 17:46.760
-And Miche.
-Oh, and Miche, as well.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.120
-Brilliant. Really good.
-Smashed that.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.240
[emotionally]
I just wanna say...

17:54.280 --> 17:56.640
No, I'm good, don't.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.480
[coughs] That was beautiful.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.560
Just wanna say
that I'm in this for life.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.240
Yeah? Like, even if we
get divorced or whatever,

18:07.280 --> 18:09.360
once I've calmed down and
I'm not fuming at you any more,

18:09.400 --> 18:11.680
I'd probably marry you again
at the drop of a hat.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.840
Aw, thank you.

18:13.880 --> 18:17.200
-Clap then.
-[applause]

18:17.240 --> 18:20.920
Angel, do you wanna say a few
words? Tell everyone how proud
you are of Mummy and Daddy?

18:20.960 --> 18:24.120
-Go on, Angel.
-Show 'em your star quality,
go on. Say it loudly.

18:24.160 --> 18:28.360
Thank you for coming. I hope
you have a nice wedding party.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.280
-[Grindah] Bless her!
-[loud applause]

18:31.320 --> 18:34.600
The speech, mate,
I absolutely shelled it.

18:34.640 --> 18:39.160
Best one of the day.
Not to be too harsh on Angel.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.160
Probably quite disappointed
in herself, you know, like.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.000
I'd probably give myself
a solid ten,

18:46.040 --> 18:49.440
and I'd give her
two, at a push.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.960
[director]
So you think that's...

18:52.000 --> 18:55.160
Two, just because
she made the effort.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.520
OK, Mr Decoy!

18:57.560 --> 18:59.520
Run the riddim!

18:59.560 --> 19:02.280
-[music plays]
-Oh, my God, you did it,
you picked my best tune!

19:02.320 --> 19:04.400
Yeah, cos you said you liked it.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.680
-Thank you.
-Yeah, is it? All right.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.800
-[Miche] <i> We are the fairytale</i>
<i>romance, aren't we? Yeah.</i>
-[Grindah] <i> Yeah, we are.</i>

19:14.840 --> 19:18.760
<i>Well, not fairytale,
cos that shit ain't real,
but more just real life.</i>

19:18.800 --> 19:20.760
-It's our love story.
-Shoulda done
the marriage ages ago.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.560
Don't know why I was
being all weird about it.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.440
<i>-You get married and then you
live happily ever after.
-Exactly.</i>

19:27.480 --> 19:29.520
<i>-It's easy. Simple as that.
-Yeah.</i>

19:29.560 --> 19:32.200
-Do I do it? No.
-Just carry on.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.000
[gunshots play, gun loads]

19:36.040 --> 19:39.200
-Oh, my God! You wrote
me my own song?
-Yeah.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.040
-This is insane.
-Well, Decoy did, but...

Ladies and gentlemen,
the official Decoy
wedding dub play remix!

19:47.840 --> 19:49.680
Get us skanking.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.040
Looks like I'm shooting you
in the head.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.560
[Miche] <i> We haven't got</i>
<i>a honeymoon planned yet,</i>

19:56.600 --> 19:59.760
<i>cos Grindah doesn't really
like anywhere hot, or cold.</i>

19:59.800 --> 20:03.760
<i>So we haven't really got
any choices, but we're just
gonna be really happy, I think.</i>

20:03.800 --> 20:08.120
That's it. With no more worries,
we're just gonna enjoy the
rest of our days together.

20:09.480 --> 20:11.960
Where's my gold mic?
I'm not using this.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.840
I got your mic.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.000
I need to talk to you, man.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.240
-What?
-I need to talk to you.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.360
-No, Steves, help us
clear the tables.
-It's important, man.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.280
Yeah, tell me later.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.440
-It's about radio.
-Not now.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.520
I don't like secrets.
I don't like having that thing,

20:29.560 --> 20:33.360
you know, that weird feeling
when you have a secret
inside you and, like,

20:33.400 --> 20:37.560
you can't say it. I hate that.
I'm all about the truth.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.320
Bruv, I need to talk
to you, seriously.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.800
Steves, stop. Shut up!

20:41.840 --> 20:44.240
-Sorry.
-You're getting in his head.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.560
It makes me feel weird
and I'm not a secrets guy,

20:48.600 --> 20:51.040
you know, I'm a truth-seeker.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.920
This is gonna be the best
night of your life.

20:53.960 --> 20:58.200
-Standard news.
-I am the best MC you have ever
heard in your whole entire life.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.280
-Ever.
-Hold tight! Steves!

21:01.320 --> 21:04.520
I think it's time to show
them who the best MC
in the galaxy is.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.320
[they start freestyling]

21:12.200 --> 21:16.360
[Beats] <i> This ain't one of them</i>
<i>daytime raves where you do</i>
<i>yoga and have smoothies...</i>

21:16.400 --> 21:20.040
-None of that.
-And a weird DJ in East London.
It's a proper daytime rave.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.800
Know what I'm saying? Listen,
you'll feel like it's
night-time, know what I mean?

21:22.840 --> 21:26.440
Like, proper tunes and that.
Blazing, bare chicks.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.680
-Yeah, bare chicks.
-Trust me.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.920
-And no mum's with kids in
the rave. Like, dead that.
-Get out!

21:31.960 --> 21:35.240
-This is pure corruption
in its purest format.
-Exactly.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.920
-But Miche and Angel
will be there, won't they?
-That's their wedding, innit?

21:38.960 --> 21:41.680
Come on, girls.
Come on, Angel. Wooh!

21:46.080 --> 21:48.160
What's up, chicks?

21:49.320 --> 21:52.560
Chabuddy, by the way.
No worries.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.360
What material is that shirt?

21:58.760 --> 22:01.200
Is it nylon?

22:01.240 --> 22:04.760
Is it nylon? Is that nylon?

22:04.800 --> 22:07.160
No worries.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.920
[baby cries]

22:12.800 --> 22:15.480
Is she out here?
Where'd she go?

22:15.520 --> 22:18.760
Roche, there you are.
I thought you were
going for a dance.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.640
Yeah, I was. Er, just...
Oh, I can't. I'm smoking.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.520
-She's your baby.
-All right. Come here, darling.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.680
-There you go.
-All right. Thanks, Susan.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.040
Well, that was a little
bit of freedom, wasn't it?

22:35.000 --> 22:41.074

22:45.280 --> 22:47.840
Ssh, not now, Steves.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.200
Steves, what are you doing
on stage? We're in the middle
of a set. Get off the stage!

22:51.240 --> 22:53.720
Sorry about that, people.

22:53.760 --> 22:57.480
I wasn't the one trying
to interrupt man when
I'm in my lyrical zone.

22:57.520 --> 23:00.320
All right, boys? Decoy!

23:00.360 --> 23:03.200
Oh, come on, Decoy,
for fuck's sake!

23:03.240 --> 23:06.240
I ain't come in two months.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.160
All right?

23:11.200 --> 23:15.160
Ah, Steves, you couldn't take
her for a minute, could ya?

23:15.200 --> 23:18.240
I really could do
with a little...

23:18.280 --> 23:20.960
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, just...

23:21.000 --> 23:24.160
-Sorry, mate.
-No, everything's fine.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.920
All right, Nan? Yeah.
Everything's all right.

23:27.960 --> 23:31.200
-Yeah, go on.
-Oh, thanks. You're a legend.

23:31.240 --> 23:35.120
-[baby cries]
-Ah, she's so good
with you, Steves.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.200
-Hey, Tanya, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

23:40.240 --> 23:44.080
-Yeah. Chabuddy.
-Oh, yeah. I'm Miche's boss.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.280
Oh, wow. Boss lady!

23:46.320 --> 23:49.400
-Yeah, I'm good.
-I've got a really
high sperm count.

23:49.440 --> 23:54.160
-Did you just say you've got
a really high sperm count?
-Yeah. Very, very potent.

23:54.200 --> 23:59.080
-I'm just gonna forget this
conversation every happened.
-Yeah, cool. No worries.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.760
[Chabsie] <i> Yeah, I'm a great</i>
<i>dancer, you know. I've got</i>
<i>kind of child-bearing hips.</i>

24:02.800 --> 24:06.200
So, you know women do twerking?
I actually do front twerk,

24:06.240 --> 24:11.000
which is just my gusset
and my penis, just kind
of shaking, like that.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.880
Very subtle. Just balls
gently going up and down,

24:14.920 --> 24:19.320
releasing a scent
and letting the women know,
"Hey, I'm available."

24:21.840 --> 24:24.400
Oh, sorry. You all right?

24:24.440 --> 24:26.520
-Yeah, all right, Chabs?
-How you doing?

24:26.560 --> 24:29.440
-I'm doing good. You?
-Yeah, really good.

24:29.480 --> 24:33.200
And then, obviously,
you combine the front twerk
with the shoulders.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.120
Altogether, it's
a very powerful look.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.720
I like that. Shake it, baby!
[chuckles]

24:43.080 --> 24:45.320
We're fucking brilliant!

24:47.000 --> 24:50.480
Basically, they took everything.
They took the money as well.

24:54.240 --> 24:57.040
Obviously, like,
I'll pay you back and that.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.880
Basically, I owe you
four grand now.

24:59.920 --> 25:04.120
We'll just say that,
innit, like? Yeah?

25:04.160 --> 25:07.160
[MC Grindah freestyles]

25:22.560 --> 25:25.720
-Are you enjoying yourself?
-Yeah, definitely. I'm
having a bit of a sit down,

25:25.760 --> 25:28.640
cos actually it's not as fun
as you'd think to wear this.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.440
I've never tried it myself!

25:30.480 --> 25:33.400
That's the last one
from myself and DJ Beats.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.320
Make some fucking noise,
bloods, right now!

25:36.360 --> 25:39.080
They love me! They love me!

25:39.120 --> 25:42.120
-He's good though, ain't he?
-Oh, he's amazing.
Yeah, really good.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.880
He gets his sense of rhythm
from me, you know.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.520
[director] Do you think
Grindah's similar to his dad?

25:47.560 --> 25:50.760
I think Grindah's dad is a DILF,
because obviously Grindah's
gonna turn into his dad...

25:50.800 --> 25:54.160
-DILF? What does that even mean?
-A dad that I'd like to...

25:54.200 --> 25:57.400
You know. He's also a HILF
now, because he's a husband...

25:57.440 --> 26:01.120
No, I'm not. Nah,
I'll tell you what I am.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.280
I'm a MILF -
an MC I'd like to fuck.

26:04.320 --> 26:08.840
Not me, but other people.
Grindah, AKA top MILF.

26:08.880 --> 26:13.000
-Give us a leg up, babe. Ooh!
-I touched your bum again.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.800
I know! You're gonna touch
more than that in a minute.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.680
Oh, my God! I can't believe
this is happening.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.080
-Right.
-Hey, get in.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.360
[Steves] I gotta clean
all this shit up now.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.320
<i>You can't be too careful
these days.</i>

26:29.360 --> 26:33.200
<i>We're all being watched
by the government, but
there's a select few people</i>

26:33.240 --> 26:35.160
<i>who can see what's going on.</i>

26:35.200 --> 26:37.600
And that's me.

26:37.640 --> 26:40.840
This is the face of somebody
who's seen a lot.

26:43.760 --> 26:46.600
-Steven Green?
-No, I'm another Steves.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.640
-We need to speak to you.
-I'm a different Steves.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.920
Steven... Get down!
I'm arresting you...

26:50.960 --> 26:52.840
What do you mean?

26:52.880 --> 26:55.680
For offences committed under the
Wireless Telegraphy Act, 2006.

26:55.720 --> 26:58.640
And for the possession of
Class A drugs with the intent
to supply. Do you understand?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.840
One, two, three. It's in.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.200
Wooh! Did it at an angle.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.320
-It's quite hard.
-Thank you.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.120
I think getting back with Miche
has taught me a valuable lesson.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.400
It's made me realise I can do
anything I want in life.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.960
And that's what relationships
are all about.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.880
Miche'll be there whatever
happens, whatever I do.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.360
They'll be there whatever I do.
And now we're ready to
shell the game.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.840
[Miche] I think relationships
always change over time,

27:22.880 --> 27:25.160
and it's like you sort of
have to just grow with them.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.800
It's also about taking
those next steps together.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.280
So, like, now that we're finally
married, maybe it's time

27:30.320 --> 27:33.640
to start thinking about
making Angel a lovely
little brother or a sister.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.360
Eh?

27:35.400 --> 27:37.840
[Beats] It's about love.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.840
Love just catches you sometimes
and you don't even know why,

27:40.880 --> 27:42.880
like, you can't explain it.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.200
-[Carol] Make it hard then!
-[Chabsie] It is hard.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.880
Well, thumb it in then, yeah,
I'm beginning to sober up.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.960
This time next year I wanna be
in a bloody mansion, mate.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.760
Just chicks everywhere, parties.
We're living the dream.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.840
[Chabsie groans]

27:58.880 --> 28:00.880
-Thumb it in!
-I am!

28:00.920 --> 28:04.240
-I can't even feel it.
-Oh... Oh, I've come!

28:04.280 --> 28:07.520
-I've come, I've come!
-You are fucking kidding me.

28:07.560 --> 28:11.560
Yeah, go on. We should've got
the photographer to do this bit
really, shouldn't we?

28:11.600 --> 28:13.880
It'd be a bit weird
for this bit, wouldn't it?

28:13.920 --> 28:15.920
[Grindah] Behind every
strong man there is a woman

28:15.960 --> 28:20.600
and loads of mates
and...draw and...

28:20.640 --> 28:25.360
But she's a part of that,
do you know what I mean? And
without that, it all crumbles.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.880
-Come on. Let's go.
-I'm not even a drug dealer.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.320
That's just all for me. That's
my normal amount that I have.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.800
-We're young in this game.
-Are you getting me?

28:34.840 --> 28:37.040
-We've only just
started in this game.
-Are you getting me, like?

28:37.080 --> 28:41.080
-Trust me, we're babies.
-And we're ready to grow
like giants out here.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.880
-You're gonna make the lift
smell of bacon.
-Oh, shut up!

28:43.920 --> 28:46.280
-So nothing can stop you?
-Nah, we're unstoppable.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.720
We're unstoppable, mate,
like what's-his-name?

28:48.760 --> 28:51.880
-Like fucking Keanu Reeves
in "Speed".
-Exactly.
