you stupid little shit.

49:03.858 --> 49:07.942
Yeah, stupid. Good, rub it in!

49:08.904 --> 49:10.155
Just give me my money.

49:10.322 --> 49:13.189
-How am I supposed to live?
-Get a job.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.536
I can't fucking read.

49:16.704 --> 49:18.194
Not my problem.

49:22.376 --> 49:23.491
Fuck you.

49:26.547 --> 49:29.539
You ain't gonna shoot shit.

50:10.299 --> 50:13.416
-Your Majesty.
-Hm.

50:14.345 --> 50:17.257
We'll sidestep your recent defection.

50:18.265 --> 50:19.971
For now.

50:21.435 --> 50:25.144
Tell me, do I make a good widow?

50:25.314 --> 50:26.599
You are a vision.

50:27.441 --> 50:32.777
Bill, don't be such a sourpuss.

50:33.781 --> 50:36.193
Aren't you the least bit excited?

50:36.367 --> 50:38.949
Russell is no more.

50:39.119 --> 50:41.246
I am pleased, yes.

50:41.914 --> 50:46.624
Dear me. How dreary you are.

50:48.087 --> 50:51.079
All right, bring me the girl.

50:52.383 --> 50:55.466
I have waited centuries to find a true fae.

50:56.845 --> 51:00.337
I can't wait to feel
the sunlight on my skin again.

51:01.308 --> 51:03.094
Maybe I'll get a yacht.

51:03.811 --> 51:05.597
Sookie is not here.

51:07.106 --> 51:12.146
Yes, I brought you here
under false pretenses.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.769
But I do have another surprise for you.

51:16.490 --> 51:18.481
Only one of us will leave this house.

51:21.495 --> 51:25.659
You dare challenge me?

51:26.875 --> 51:29.207
I'm over twice your age.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.285
Yes.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.922
But I have nothing left to lose.

51:35.092 --> 51:37.674
[GROWLING]

51:57.698 --> 52:02.192
Gran, I am so lost.

52:04.246 --> 52:09.616
I followed my heart,
but it led me down a dead-end road.

52:13.213 --> 52:15.955
I miss you so much.

52:18.218 --> 52:21.051
I've never felt so alone.

52:24.600 --> 52:28.138
And I've spent my whole life
feeling alone.

52:30.230 --> 52:32.061
WOMAN:
SooMe.

52:32.232 --> 52:34.063
You're not alone.

52:35.611 --> 52:36.896
Come with us.
