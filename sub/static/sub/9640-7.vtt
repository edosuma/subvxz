WEBVTT

00:07.002 --> 00:11.574
Welcome to the grand
re-opening of wiztech.

00:15.875 --> 00:20.213
We owe a big debt of gratitude to
justin russo for saving wiztech

00:20.248 --> 00:24.551
By removing the plastic balls
from our hallowed halls.

00:24.585 --> 00:27.689
And we know how dangerous
plastic is to wizards.

00:27.723 --> 00:31.194
we hate plastic! We hate plastic!

00:31.228 --> 00:35.199
Thank you, thank you. We're wizards.
We all hate plastic, right?

00:37.437 --> 00:41.708
Saving wiztech wouldn't have been possible
without the generous financial support

00:41.743 --> 00:44.878
Of the wizworld industries,
so let's...

00:48.649 --> 00:50.851
I, uh, hope that's ok
with you, professor.

00:50.885 --> 00:54.388
Of course. A few advertisements
is a small price to pay

00:54.422 --> 00:57.725
For the reopening of
our beloved school.

00:57.759 --> 01:00.828
As long as the sign
isn't made of plastic.

01:00.862 --> 01:02.463
Ahh.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.600
Now, I would like to invite
wiztech student, hugh normous,

01:05.634 --> 01:07.502
To cut the ceremonial ribbon.

01:14.677 --> 01:18.915
Oh, no thanks. My giant hands
will never fit in those scissors.

01:18.949 --> 01:21.084
I'll have to use my own.

01:27.758 --> 01:31.961
- Gee...
- Oh, are you kidding me?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.073 --> 01:44.174
Whoa. Finally.

01:44.209 --> 01:46.376
Tv how I want it.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.244
All commercials.

01:50.647 --> 01:53.015
Thanks for coming
back with me, alex.

01:53.249 --> 01:56.752
And I promise I'll make you forget about
that boyfriend who broke your heart.

01:58.188 --> 01:59.421
Yeah.

01:59.456 --> 02:00.622
Dean.

02:00.657 --> 02:02.524
Almost forgot about him.

02:02.558 --> 02:05.360
Thanks for hitting the
reset button on that.

02:05.395 --> 02:06.928
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

02:06.963 --> 02:09.698
No, this is a new start for you.

02:09.732 --> 02:12.100
You have no idea
what's possible here.

02:12.135 --> 02:14.336
And you're a very special girl.

02:15.838 --> 02:19.140
very, very special.

02:22.077 --> 02:24.846
More special than
you will ever know!

02:24.880 --> 02:28.750
Um, I'm sorry. I can't hear you
with all this evil thunder.

02:28.784 --> 02:31.285
- Oh. I said you're special.
- Oh, thank you.

02:33.055 --> 02:36.390
ominous thunder and
lightning brought to you by

02:36.425 --> 02:38.225
The wizworld weather channel.

02:39.695 --> 02:41.295
Now, that could get annoying.

02:41.496 --> 02:44.799
You think this would look
good with my board shorts?

02:44.833 --> 02:47.834
- I'm gonna get it anyway.
- Ok. You do that.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.738
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

02:51.772 --> 02:53.806
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

02:54.074 --> 02:55.742
* you can fix any problem
at the slightest ease *

02:55.776 --> 02:57.476
* yes, please *

02:57.511 --> 02:59.378
* well, you might find out
it'll go to your head *

03:00.046 --> 03:01.814
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

03:01.848 --> 03:04.349
* with a snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

03:04.383 --> 03:06.084
* that's what I said *

03:06.118 --> 03:09.054
* everything is not what it seems *

03:09.088 --> 03:12.825
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

03:12.859 --> 03:16.662
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

03:16.697 --> 03:20.899
* because everything
is not what it seems *

03:20.933 --> 03:24.369
* everything is not what it seems *

03:24.403 --> 03:28.272
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

03:28.306 --> 03:32.010
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

03:32.044 --> 03:34.979
* because everything is not *

03:36.281 --> 03:37.948
* what it seems *

03:37.949 --> 03:44.649

03:44.789 --> 03:46.823
Junior, I cursed the castle

03:46.857 --> 03:48.991
So I could turn the whole
place into a ball room

03:49.026 --> 03:50.993
For the best birthday ever.

03:51.027 --> 03:52.527
Now it's ruined.

03:52.562 --> 03:56.164
Dad, I have a better evil plan.

03:56.198 --> 04:00.767
To restore our
family's evil powers.

04:00.802 --> 04:03.569
Oh, now, that is a
fantastic birthday gift.

04:03.604 --> 04:07.005
But you know, I'd rather have
some of those shoe skates.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.908
Size ten.

04:09.942 --> 04:12.211
Dad, focus.

04:12.245 --> 04:14.647
- All right.
- All we need to do

04:14.681 --> 04:18.283
Is get alex russo up to
the tower of evil with me.

04:18.317 --> 04:21.619
And then we can turn this place
into an evil wizard school.

04:21.653 --> 04:24.287
- Dad?
- Hmm?

04:24.321 --> 04:27.255
That is a great evil plan.
I am proud of you.

04:27.289 --> 04:31.359
yeah, well, actually,
I didn't think of that.

04:31.393 --> 04:33.727
Justin russo gave me the idea.

04:33.762 --> 04:35.729
Oh, well, take credit
for it, anyway.

04:35.763 --> 04:37.263
And that's evil.

04:37.297 --> 04:39.598
Now, in the meantime,

04:39.633 --> 04:42.401
Make sure no one sees this.

04:48.574 --> 04:51.009
Jiggly fruit dessert!

04:51.043 --> 04:53.444
My party's back on.

04:53.478 --> 04:54.545
No!

04:54.579 --> 04:57.514
No, this is alex's boyfriend.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.516
I hid him in here
in the supply closet

04:59.550 --> 05:01.951
So we can get alex up
to the tower of evil.

05:01.985 --> 05:05.654
That sounds delicious.

05:05.688 --> 05:08.456
Dad, I know what you're thinking.

05:08.490 --> 05:10.525
Don't eat it!

05:13.762 --> 05:14.861
Stop it!

05:14.896 --> 05:18.331
Oh. And, um, also,

05:18.365 --> 05:22.067
I need you to get rid of this silly
wooden card alex's boyfriend made for her.

05:22.102 --> 05:24.837
Oh, isn't that sweet?

05:24.871 --> 05:26.839
- Dad, you're evil.
- Right.

05:32.011 --> 05:33.811
Oh, hey. Cool booth. Who's this?

05:33.845 --> 05:35.945
- My father.
- The evil one?

05:35.980 --> 05:37.280
Yes, I am.

05:37.315 --> 05:39.148
But defeated.

05:39.183 --> 05:41.617
- By your brother?
- Oh, right.

05:41.651 --> 05:44.319
I'm horribly defeat...
I'm terribly defeat...

05:44.353 --> 05:47.255
I'm a mess. Just
selling t-shirts here.

05:47.289 --> 05:50.324
Not hiding anything back there
in jiggly, fruity dessert.

05:50.359 --> 05:52.626
You are not good at hiding things!

05:55.063 --> 05:57.998
And by hiding things,

05:58.032 --> 06:03.169
I mean hiding......What amazing
deals these t-shirts are.

06:04.904 --> 06:07.138
- These are pretty good deals.
- Yeah.

06:07.173 --> 06:09.974
- Do you have this in blue?
- I'll look in the supply closet.

06:10.008 --> 06:11.742
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:14.178 --> 06:15.345
Let's just, uh...

06:17.681 --> 06:19.982
Oh, look. It's a blue.

06:20.016 --> 06:23.785
Thank you.

06:23.820 --> 06:27.622
You better get to class. - When I was
with dean we never went to class.

06:27.657 --> 06:30.191
Well, I'll try and be a
better influence on you.

06:30.226 --> 06:33.094
Oh. A lot of people have tried.
Good luck with that.

06:33.128 --> 06:36.596
Well, uh, hey,
how about after class

06:36.630 --> 06:40.565
We have a picnic in this great place I know,
on top of the tower of evil.

06:40.599 --> 06:43.433
Oh. I was told to never go
to places that are evil.

06:43.468 --> 06:46.470
Oh, it was just named after...

06:46.505 --> 06:49.439
...William. Evil.

06:50.675 --> 06:52.008
The architect.

06:52.042 --> 06:54.243
He's famous for a lot of buildings.

06:54.278 --> 06:56.212
- Oh, yeah, I've heard of him.
- You have?

06:56.246 --> 06:58.514
No, I was just trying
to impress you.

07:13.093 --> 07:14.727
Hey, hugh.

07:14.761 --> 07:16.061
That's funny.

07:16.096 --> 07:18.697
It sounded like I said, "hey, you."

07:23.668 --> 07:25.903
Anyway.

07:25.937 --> 07:28.805
What are you doing there,
pulling a cereal box on a wagon?

07:28.839 --> 07:31.307
No, it's not cereal.

07:31.341 --> 07:34.643
- It's a massive billboard.
- Oh.

07:34.677 --> 07:37.078
Wizworld industries picked
me to haul it around.

07:37.113 --> 07:39.747
You know, 'cause I'm a giant.

07:39.781 --> 07:44.684
Well, if I order the cool binoculars
on the back, maybi could see it.

07:44.719 --> 07:47.720
You think all these advertisements
around here are a bit too much?

07:47.754 --> 07:51.823
Well, if by "a bit too much"
you mean "a bit too terrific,"

07:51.857 --> 07:53.924
Then yes! Check this out.

07:57.395 --> 07:59.162
"why buy wizworld? Why not?"

07:59.296 --> 08:02.731
I, uh... I wouldn't wear
that in class if I were you.

08:02.766 --> 08:04.366
Oh, I'm wearing it for class.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.335
Sign wearing 101.

08:06.369 --> 08:08.603
- That's a class?
- Uh-huh.

08:08.638 --> 08:12.573
What about learning wizardry
and spells and potions?

08:12.608 --> 08:14.475
All the things that I
love about wiztech.

08:14.509 --> 08:16.844
whoo!

08:19.148 --> 08:21.382
Wizworld industries!

08:21.416 --> 08:24.920
They've got products, yes, they do.

08:24.954 --> 08:28.423
They've got products
to sell to you. Whoo!

08:28.458 --> 08:29.991
Wizworld!

08:33.695 --> 08:35.429
I could learn to love that.

08:38.298 --> 08:41.566
No! All this advertising
is corrupting my school!

08:41.600 --> 08:42.967
Whoo!

08:49.072 --> 08:50.806
Oh. Sorry.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.945
I'm working on this for my advertising
class, called "blimp-ertising."

08:57.979 --> 08:59.412
That's it!

08:59.447 --> 09:01.748
Wizworld said they'd put
up a couple of signs.

09:01.782 --> 09:04.516
Those tiny little
executives lied to me.

09:06.586 --> 09:08.586
I need to speak to
professor crumbs.

09:11.956 --> 09:13.490
Here we are.

09:13.524 --> 09:15.492
The entrance to the tower of evil.

09:15.659 --> 09:19.428
Shall we? - I thought you
said we were gonna picnic.

09:19.462 --> 09:22.030
- Where's your basket?
- Um...

09:22.064 --> 09:23.731
A bear took it.

09:25.567 --> 09:28.635
Look, if you're trying to make
me scared of some pretend bear

09:28.669 --> 09:30.403
So you can put your arms around m

09:30.437 --> 09:31.904
I'll play along. Watch.

09:31.938 --> 09:34.539
Oh, no. A bear! Protect me.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.410
Real cute. Well, come on.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.512
There is a wicked view up there.

09:40.546 --> 09:44.882
Although it's nothing
compared to this view.

09:47.686 --> 09:49.019
Why are you looking at me?

09:49.154 --> 09:51.821
Oh, I get it. I'm the view. Duh.

09:56.526 --> 10:00.861
Oh, professor crumbs, look,
I know I brought wizworld industries in,

10:00.896 --> 10:04.398
But nobody's learning anything
except how to buy wizworld products.

10:04.433 --> 10:08.468
Well, wizworld products are
high-quality and affordable.

10:08.503 --> 10:12.906
Hi. This professor has been brought
to you by wizworld industries.

10:15.476 --> 10:18.477
What was that? - Wizworld
industries is sponsoring me.

10:18.511 --> 10:22.314
Kind of like a walk-a-thon,
except I get to keep the money.

10:22.348 --> 10:24.682
This has gone too far.

10:25.817 --> 10:27.050
Hey, justin!

10:27.185 --> 10:31.588
I heard that alex went
to the tower of evil.

10:32.657 --> 10:34.557
Where did you hear that?

10:34.591 --> 10:36.559
That's what everybody's
talking about.

10:36.593 --> 10:39.763
Well, that, and my
awesome sign flipping.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.103
Not to worry.

10:46.137 --> 10:47.637
Alex is perfectly safe

10:47.971 --> 10:50.605
As long as she doesn't go up
there with ronald longcape.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.206
That's exactly who she
went up there with.

10:53.241 --> 10:57.443
- Oh, no.
- What do you mean, "oh, no?"

10:57.477 --> 11:01.946
I mean, if alex goes up to the tower of
evil and plays the tetherball of evil,

11:01.981 --> 11:04.415
- She'll become evil.
- Oh, I love tetherball.

11:04.449 --> 11:07.818
It's the only ball that
you can never lose.

11:07.852 --> 11:11.587
If ronald and she become evil,
then they have the evil strength...

11:11.622 --> 11:13.389
To take over wiztech
and make it evil.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.123
I knew that guy was evil.

11:15.324 --> 11:17.859
But then he talked me into
believing that he wasn't evil.

11:17.894 --> 11:21.029
Which is totally evil of him.

11:21.064 --> 11:23.898
Come on. We've got to go stop them.

11:23.932 --> 11:25.733
I'll stay here.

11:30.304 --> 11:32.205
Ooh, lovely.

11:32.239 --> 11:36.142
This is the strangest
greeting card I've ever seen.

11:36.176 --> 11:38.377
I like this one, yes.

11:38.411 --> 11:40.479
I don't think anybody's
gonna mind that.

11:46.752 --> 11:48.152
Oh, wow.

11:48.186 --> 11:50.053
It's so romantic up here.

11:50.088 --> 11:52.822
We should look at the stars.
It's kind of our thing.

11:52.857 --> 11:57.460
Yeah. And you know what else is
our thing? Playing tetherball.

11:57.494 --> 11:59.561
Playing tetherball? No, it isn't.

11:59.596 --> 12:01.463
Well, can it be?

12:03.599 --> 12:07.234
Uh, no. I think looking at the stars
is more romantic than tetherball.

12:07.268 --> 12:11.370
Well, then,
how about we stand here.

12:11.405 --> 12:15.106
Next to this pole and
look up at the stars

12:15.140 --> 12:17.841
And maybe just bat the
ball around a little.

12:17.875 --> 12:21.944
I gotta tell you, ronald,
I'm not all that into playground games.

12:21.978 --> 12:23.679
I'm really into
just being with you.

12:26.815 --> 12:29.149
Come on, alex. Just one game.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.385
I don't even know how to play.

12:31.419 --> 12:33.820
You just keep hitting it
back and forth for a while.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.722
Sounds complicated. No.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.458
- Hit it.
- No.

12:38.492 --> 12:39.759
- Hit it.
- No!

12:39.794 --> 12:41.160
- Hit it!
- No!

12:41.362 --> 12:45.264
- Hey, I'm doing it.
- Good. Keep going.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.836
It's glowing. It's working!

12:49.871 --> 12:53.239
- Why is it glowing?
- This is good. This is good!

12:53.273 --> 12:55.440
Why is this good?

12:55.475 --> 12:58.310
- 'cause it's our thing.
- It's not our thing.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.480
alex, no!

13:07.044 --> 13:10.046
Whoo! That was a lot of stairs!

13:12.183 --> 13:15.618
I should really run instead of
hiding under the bleachers during pe.

13:15.652 --> 13:19.188
why didn't you guys
just take the elevator?

13:19.222 --> 13:21.056
There's an elevator?

13:22.758 --> 13:25.459
There needs to be better
signage in this tower of evil.

13:25.494 --> 13:28.362
What are you guys even doing here?

13:28.396 --> 13:31.865
Alex, you gotta stop playing
tetherball or you're gonna turn evil.

13:31.899 --> 13:34.099
You're too late, justin.

13:34.134 --> 13:37.102
In less than a minute,
alex and I will have turned evil,

13:37.136 --> 13:40.972
To destroy wiztech and begin
our evil lives together.

13:41.006 --> 13:42.607
- What?
- Oh, I heard him.

13:42.641 --> 13:44.442
He said that you and
he are gonna start

13:44.543 --> 13:46.711
Your evil lives together.
Congratulations.

13:46.745 --> 13:49.713
It's too late to stop
the evil, justin.

13:49.747 --> 13:52.046
Your sister has served her purpose.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.682
Wait. Is that why you
brought me up here?

13:54.716 --> 13:57.950
For evil? You used me to
complete your evil plan?

13:57.985 --> 14:00.686
Well, it could have been any russo.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.887
Come on, justin,
let's go spit over the edge.

14:05.122 --> 14:06.855
I guess it had to be you.

14:08.090 --> 14:10.124
Max, we're trying to stop evil.

14:10.159 --> 14:12.660
You fight evil your way,
I'll fight it mine.

14:13.767 --> 14:17.036
You lied to me, ronald. You told me
that I was special and I fell for it.

14:17.070 --> 14:20.873
- I can't believe I broke up with dean.
- He broke up with you.

14:20.907 --> 14:24.342
Look, the story we're telling everybody
is that I broke up with him, ok?

14:24.377 --> 14:26.811
Maybe you won't turn evil.
Maybe it's not too late.

14:26.912 --> 14:29.880
wizworld industries
is proud to announce

14:29.914 --> 14:35.051
That evil will commence in three,
two, one...

14:35.085 --> 14:37.086
Evil.

14:41.190 --> 14:42.591
Yeah, it's too late.

14:45.061 --> 14:46.828
I don't look like him, do I?

14:53.868 --> 14:57.937
Professor, we're too late. - I would have
been here sooner, but somebody spit on me.

14:57.972 --> 15:00.373
I had to change my robes.

15:00.407 --> 15:03.609
Bull's eye! - yeah, well,
you didn't make it.

15:03.643 --> 15:06.844
My evil powers have been restored.

15:06.879 --> 15:11.483
I am taking over wiztech
and making it evil!

15:11.517 --> 15:13.386
and professor crumbs,

15:13.420 --> 15:15.288
Um, I'm firing you.

15:15.323 --> 15:19.992
And just to prove that I am evil,

15:20.027 --> 15:23.129
I'll take that beard.

15:40.144 --> 15:41.510
Thank you.

15:43.179 --> 15:46.013
Before I go, I'd like
to give alex something

15:46.048 --> 15:48.882
That I believe belongs to her.

15:51.485 --> 15:54.420
I can't get used to looking
at him without the beard!

15:57.724 --> 15:59.591
It's from dean.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.859
That's impossible!

16:00.893 --> 16:02.527
"dear russo,

16:02.561 --> 16:05.429
I was thinking, maybe I
should start calling you alex,

16:05.463 --> 16:06.996
So here it goes.

16:07.031 --> 16:09.532
Dear alex, I like you.

16:09.566 --> 16:10.833
Signed, moriarti.

16:10.867 --> 16:12.901
I mean, dean."

16:14.403 --> 16:15.869
Aw, dean.

16:15.904 --> 16:18.039
And there's not a grade on it.

16:18.073 --> 16:20.440
It wasn't an assignment.

16:20.475 --> 16:24.143
- Then why'd he break up with me?
- He didn't. I did.

16:24.178 --> 16:27.246
And you fell for it.

16:28.548 --> 16:31.016
I'm stopping seeing you.
See you in school.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.784
It was you?

16:34.052 --> 16:35.953
Absolutely.

16:36.755 --> 16:40.056
And now, evil is mine.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.430
Oh, my gosh, evil has taken over.
We've got to warn the others.

16:48.398 --> 16:50.434
There's an elevator.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.808
These things are slow.

16:59.043 --> 17:01.644
Wait a minute.

17:01.679 --> 17:04.646
There is a way evil can be undone.

17:04.682 --> 17:07.683
If one of the tetherball
players is in love,

17:07.717 --> 17:09.617
Then evil is cancelled.

17:09.652 --> 17:11.419
- Ronald?
- Hm?

17:11.454 --> 17:13.221
Are you in love with anyone?

17:15.723 --> 17:17.057
Yes.

17:18.593 --> 17:21.161
Is that someone yourself?

17:21.194 --> 17:23.195
Yes.

17:26.967 --> 17:28.400
Doesn't count.

17:28.435 --> 17:31.503
Alex russo, are you
in love with someone?

17:31.537 --> 17:32.804
Oh, my goodness.

17:32.838 --> 17:35.039
I guess I am.

17:36.541 --> 17:37.874
I'm in love with dean.

17:37.909 --> 17:39.809
I believe you are.

17:47.784 --> 17:49.217
What's happening to me?

17:49.252 --> 17:52.520
The natural power of love!

17:56.491 --> 17:58.892
Ew. I found him attractive?

18:00.761 --> 18:04.396
Well, you can love dean,

18:04.430 --> 18:08.566
- But he can't love you back!
- What are you saying, ronald?

18:08.601 --> 18:12.169
That I have trapped your precious
dean in a jiggly fruit dessert.

18:12.204 --> 18:16.072
And I have hidden him somewhere
you will never find him.

18:16.107 --> 18:18.608
finally.

18:20.911 --> 18:23.012
Oh, hi, son.

18:23.046 --> 18:26.782
Having all this jiggly fruit dessert
around is just too tempting.

18:26.816 --> 18:29.785
I thought I'd better hide
your encased boy up here.

18:29.819 --> 18:30.886
Dean!

18:30.920 --> 18:32.654
Oooh, no.

18:32.688 --> 18:35.623
Dad, this is why

18:35.658 --> 18:38.826
We've failed at being an
evil family all these years.

18:38.860 --> 18:43.530
Evil is one thing but mean is
a hurt that never goes away.

18:45.599 --> 18:46.766
All right!

18:47.902 --> 18:50.636
No one try and follow
us or loverboy gets it.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.306
No, wait, dean!

18:53.340 --> 18:55.241
Justin, we have to take the stairs.

18:55.275 --> 18:57.543
Couldn't we just wait for
the elevator to come back?

18:57.578 --> 18:59.345
Justin, even I know
that's a bad idea.

19:00.814 --> 19:02.848
Fine. Grab my hands.

19:02.883 --> 19:04.250
We're wizards.

19:04.284 --> 19:06.452
We'll take our own way down.

19:14.026 --> 19:16.126
Pillows for feet spell.
Nice one, justin.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.128
I know. Pillows for feet.
Never thought I'd use it.

19:21.598 --> 19:25.167
Oh, man, I got hit
with my own spit.

19:25.201 --> 19:28.036
not your spit. Bull's eye!

19:31.807 --> 19:35.008
- There they are. Let's catch them.
- You'll never catch me.

19:38.479 --> 19:40.446
I think we're gonna catch him.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.081
Never!

19:44.984 --> 19:46.785
We just caught you, dude.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.387
Curses.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.222
I almost got away.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.623
Oh, great.

19:52.657 --> 19:55.825
I was with a guy that
said "curses." not hot.

19:55.860 --> 19:58.761
I'll take my beard back.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.777
Higgly wiggly,
get out of that jiggly

20:19.046 --> 20:21.714
Hey, russo. I came by
to give you something.

20:21.749 --> 20:24.450
Oh, no. I lost it.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.451
- I'll go make you another one.
- No.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.754
I think you dropped it.

20:30.690 --> 20:31.890
Read it to me.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.161
"dear russo,

20:37.195 --> 20:39.729
I was thinking maybe I should
start calling you alex.

20:39.763 --> 20:43.432
So here it goes. Dear alex,

20:43.466 --> 20:45.500
I like you.

20:45.534 --> 20:47.368
Signed, moriarti.

20:47.402 --> 20:48.870
I mean, dean."

20:50.706 --> 20:53.374
- Aw. I love it.
- You do?

20:53.408 --> 20:55.242
Yes.

20:55.277 --> 20:57.010
And I love...

20:59.480 --> 21:00.881
...This card.

21:02.383 --> 21:05.052
- You just said that.
- Well, that's how much I love it.

21:05.086 --> 21:06.620
I love it so much.

21:06.654 --> 21:10.123
more than you will ever know.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.194
Why did you say it like that?

21:14.662 --> 21:17.230
I don't know. I thought I'd give
it a shot but it's not really me.

21:22.969 --> 21:26.538
All right. First one
down the staircase wins.

21:26.572 --> 21:28.540
I'll even give you a
ten second head start.

21:28.574 --> 21:30.208
You're on.

21:30.243 --> 21:32.344
- Go!
- Go. One, two...

21:32.379 --> 21:34.446
...Three...

21:38.518 --> 21:41.787
I knew you were gonna do that
and I'm still gonna beat you.

21:41.821 --> 21:43.455
No! No, no...

21:43.490 --> 21:45.157
wait, wait!

21:48.395 --> 21:49.461
No!
