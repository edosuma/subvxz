"This Is Us"...

00:02.944 --> 00:04.567
Do you want to go on a drive?

00:04.655 --> 00:06.070
Where do you want to go?

00:06.178 --> 00:07.671
Los Angeles.

00:08.316 --> 00:11.340
My mom says I'm nuts for doing
this with a guy I barely know.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.476
We've known each other
a whole week.

00:13.837 --> 00:15.183
So, keep in touch.

00:15.532 --> 00:17.392
Definitely keep us posted
on what you're up to.

00:17.562 --> 00:19.443
<i>He said that I
was "Pittsburgh good",</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.509
which I've decided to take
as a compliment.

00:27.204 --> 00:28.792
Let's go home.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.246
Hey.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.038
Hey.

00:57.332 --> 00:58.448
Mm?

00:59.887 --> 01:01.380
We're home.

01:03.034 --> 01:04.430
Oh, wow.

01:07.506 --> 01:08.992
How long have I been out?

01:09.301 --> 01:10.934
..Just a little while.

01:13.312 --> 01:14.783
So...

01:15.792 --> 01:17.294
great third date.

01:17.511 --> 01:18.684
I thought so.

01:21.093 --> 01:22.545
Isn't it crazy?

01:22.688 --> 01:25.000
- Hmm?
- How, just a couple weeks ago,

01:25.088 --> 01:27.481
I was a girl singing at a bar
and...

01:27.854 --> 01:30.001
I locked eyes
with a cute guy...

01:30.334 --> 01:32.039
No. No, no, not you.

01:32.127 --> 01:33.587
There was another guy
there, and then he left.

01:33.674 --> 01:34.947
- Ah.
- And I saw you

01:35.050 --> 01:36.330
and I was like, "He'll do".

01:36.418 --> 01:37.926
Okay, yeah.
No, I got it.

01:40.263 --> 01:42.563
It's so strange,
isn't it?

01:42.996 --> 01:44.231
How, just like that,

01:44.318 --> 01:48.802
a complete stranger can become
such a big part of your story.

02:01.366 --> 02:03.620
<i>It's actually kind of
terrifying, you know?</i>

02:04.838 --> 02:07.086
How a single cross
with one person

02:07.173 --> 02:09.238
you've never met can change...

02:09.326 --> 02:10.893
<i>everything.</i>

02:12.191 --> 02:13.083
Yo.

02:13.171 --> 02:14.632
- What's up?
- Malik. What's up, man?

02:14.783 --> 02:15.982
- What's up, man?
- You good?

02:16.070 --> 02:17.216
- Come on in here. Come on.
- I see you,

02:17.303 --> 02:18.718
- I see you.
- Let's go.

02:19.670 --> 02:21.774
All right,
I'm stalling.

02:21.908 --> 02:25.209
'Cause I don't want to get out
of this car.

02:26.963 --> 02:28.472
Which is odd for me,

02:28.560 --> 02:30.342
'cause it's usually the...

02:30.689 --> 02:33.065
bad-boy musicians I like

02:33.185 --> 02:36.226
when it comes to
life-changing strangers.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.188
Okay.

02:52.415 --> 02:54.905
Uh, just so you know,

02:55.119 --> 02:56.859
I am gonna play it cool here,

02:56.947 --> 02:58.465
so don't expect
to get a phone call

02:58.553 --> 02:59.871
- from me right away.
- Oh, yeah.

02:59.981 --> 03:01.196
Same here.

03:01.284 --> 03:03.119
Yeah, I-I got
a pretty full plate,

03:03.207 --> 03:05.376
to be honest.
I got to find a job,

03:05.463 --> 03:07.045
- couch to crash on, so I...
- Yeah.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.888
I wouldn't expect you
to hear from me

03:08.976 --> 03:10.214
- anytime soon.
- Mm.

03:10.301 --> 03:12.004
Or maybe ever again.

03:12.289 --> 03:14.100
- It's quite possible.
- Yeah.

03:37.070 --> 03:38.584
I'm not calling you first.

03:38.672 --> 03:40.541
I'm not calling you first.

Hello?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.075
I called you first.

04:13.647 --> 04:15.251
<i>Couldn't play it cool,
huh?</i>

04:15.339 --> 04:18.024
No, that's never really been
my thing.

04:19.072 --> 04:21.209
Hey,
can I see you tomorrow?

04:21.298 --> 04:22.601
Yes.

04:23.126 --> 04:25.289
That's... that's never really been

04:25.376 --> 04:26.376
<i>my thing either.</i>

04:27.719 --> 04:29.157
Oh, shoot. Tomorrow.

04:29.245 --> 04:31.160
I'm supposed to have
dinner with my parents

04:31.247 --> 04:32.561
<i>and their friends tomorrow.</i>

04:32.648 --> 04:33.562
<i>They want...</i>

04:33.649 --> 04:34.763
<i>proof of life.</i>

04:35.488 --> 04:37.745
But you could come.

04:38.102 --> 04:39.746
I mean,
it's at their country club,

04:39.834 --> 04:41.437
<i>- so I don't know if you'd want to...</i>
- Yeah.

04:41.524 --> 04:43.872
No, I'll... I'll be there.

04:44.267 --> 04:45.841
<i>- Really?</i>
- Yeah.

04:46.525 --> 04:47.668
Great.

04:48.034 --> 04:49.638
Uh, you do have
to wear a sport coat,

04:49.726 --> 04:51.107
but they have a few there

04:51.195 --> 04:52.714
<i>if you want to just borrow one.</i>

04:52.801 --> 04:55.899
Mm, no.
Nah, I'm... I'm set.

04:56.953 --> 04:58.623
Um, hold on one second.

04:58.711 --> 05:00.705
I'm gonna go find
the address for you.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.072
<i>Okay.</i>

05:18.026 --> 05:19.107
<i>Cass.</i>

05:19.195 --> 05:20.622
- Hey. Hey, guys. <i>
- Cassidy?</i>

05:20.710 --> 05:21.607
Hey. Hey, Matty?

05:21.695 --> 05:23.810
<i>It-It's just me.
Matty couldn't stay up any longer.</i>

05:23.898 --> 05:26.272
<i>He's got school in the morning.
But I pinky swore</i>

05:26.360 --> 05:28.114
<i>I'd ask if you got
his Lightning McQueen.</i>

05:28.209 --> 05:30.991
Yeah, I did. I did.
You can tell him I did.

05:34.241 --> 05:35.487
Sorry I haven't called.

05:35.575 --> 05:36.917
<i>Ah...</i>

05:38.077 --> 05:39.515
Ryan,

05:40.514 --> 05:42.852
I miss you guys like crazy.

05:44.322 --> 05:45.912
First thing I want to do
when this is over

05:45.999 --> 05:47.502
is make breakfast
with you and Matty.

05:47.626 --> 05:48.884
We can have breakfast
for dinner.

05:48.971 --> 05:50.773
Remember when we used
to do that all the time?

05:55.191 --> 05:57.211
I think about that
all the time lately.

05:57.478 --> 05:59.379
You know that, right?
You know that...

05:59.608 --> 06:00.952
..even when
we're not talking,

06:01.040 --> 06:02.617
I think about you both
all the time.

06:02.778 --> 06:04.295
Every minute.
Every day.

06:04.606 --> 06:05.852
<i>I know.</i>

06:05.940 --> 06:07.314
<i>Sharp.</i>

06:09.387 --> 06:11.540
Hey, babe,
I got to go, okay?

06:13.432 --> 06:14.560
<i>Okay.</i>

06:14.648 --> 06:16.108
Okay.

06:17.381 --> 06:18.665
Big kiss.

06:18.866 --> 06:20.099
<i>All right.</i>

06:20.186 --> 06:21.384
<i>Bye.</i>

07:01.359 --> 07:02.424
All right, fine.

07:02.512 --> 07:04.047
It's your waistline.

07:06.576 --> 07:07.690
Oh, Sammy.

07:07.778 --> 07:10.651
Crap. No.
Sammy, get back, get back.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.158
Just stay.

07:34.439 --> 07:35.834
Can I help you?

07:36.554 --> 07:38.075
Sir? Can I help you?

07:38.163 --> 07:39.412
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

07:39.507 --> 07:40.778
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God, why did you do that?

07:40.865 --> 07:42.213
- Oh, I'm so...
- Why would you touch me?

07:42.300 --> 07:44.348
I'm so sorry. I-I
was just trying to get

07:44.435 --> 07:46.050
your attention. I-I...

07:46.231 --> 07:47.970
O-Oh, my God.

07:48.143 --> 07:49.875
- That scared me.
- I'm totally kidding.

07:50.115 --> 07:51.178
Yeah.

07:51.266 --> 07:52.656
But I'm starving.

07:52.743 --> 07:54.199
So if you could, like,
show me to a table,

07:54.286 --> 07:56.246
that would be really,
really cool.

07:56.619 --> 07:57.961
- Of course.
- Yeah.

07:58.048 --> 07:59.329
- Right this way.
- Can you just...

07:59.416 --> 08:00.474
- Yeah.
- Can you just... Yeah.

08:00.561 --> 08:01.919
Yeah. Thank you.

08:02.921 --> 08:04.000
Bro,

08:04.088 --> 08:05.902
20 minutes is too long
for homeroom.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.958
That's all I'm saying.
It's got no purpose.

08:08.046 --> 08:10.071
- They take roll in homeroom.
- Roll?

08:10.260 --> 08:12.278
Roll?
Hey, Malik, you here?

08:12.366 --> 08:14.178
- Here.
- That took one second.

08:14.266 --> 08:15.640
And we're going into junior year

08:15.728 --> 08:17.279
still losing 20 minutes
to homeroom?

08:17.367 --> 08:18.501
That's all I'm saying.

08:18.589 --> 08:20.591
Oh, that's all you're saying?
Promise?

08:20.796 --> 08:22.996
'Cause you say one more word,
you're giving me a dollar.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.213
That's cool.

08:28.169 --> 08:30.060
- Here, fool.
- <i>Give me that money.</i>

08:30.728 --> 08:32.072
You got it.

08:32.452 --> 08:33.881
Come on, man.
Put the phone down.

08:33.969 --> 08:35.177
You're obsessed with her.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.499
If she was your girl,
you'd be obsessed, too.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.062
All right, guys, look,

08:39.150 --> 08:41.503
last kickback before school
at my place tomorrow.

08:41.590 --> 08:42.764
Malik, you coming?

08:42.852 --> 08:44.258
My mom said we can invite girls,

08:44.346 --> 08:45.824
and I got you on grill duty.

08:46.268 --> 08:47.444
Maybe.

08:47.536 --> 08:49.216
Maybe.
I'll see, I'll see, I'll see.

09:06.457 --> 09:07.862
No promises on the kickback.

09:07.949 --> 09:09.064
But I got to get home.

09:09.151 --> 09:10.298
- All right.
- Told Moms that I'd bring home

09:10.385 --> 09:11.499
some food, so...

09:11.586 --> 09:14.081
- Okay.
- Catch y'all later.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.795
Hey, Ma.

09:20.883 --> 09:23.385
- Got you a burger.
- Mmm.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.283
No, no. Go away.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.650
Mmm.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.374
Not as good as yours, baby,

09:36.462 --> 09:38.292
- but mmm!
- Oh, yeah. I know.

09:39.386 --> 09:41.873
- I'm going to go head upstairs...
- Mm-mm.

09:42.334 --> 09:43.423
Don't wake that baby.

09:43.511 --> 09:45.346
Can't hear you.
Too much food in your mouth.

09:51.695 --> 09:53.196
What you doing up?

09:54.990 --> 09:56.372
Hey, Janelle.

09:56.737 --> 09:58.572
Hey. Hey.

09:59.804 --> 10:02.201
I was watching you
on my phone today.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.818
Hey, look. Look.

10:13.216 --> 10:14.995
That's you.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.164
Aw. Aw, Janelle.

10:17.322 --> 10:18.487
Come here.

10:21.232 --> 10:22.936
Oh, you're getting heavy.

10:23.337 --> 10:25.680
Long way from that NICU, huh?

10:26.300 --> 10:29.276
You know, Grandma said
not to wake you up, but, uh...

10:29.542 --> 10:31.544
Daddy trumps Grandma,
doesn't he?

10:31.794 --> 10:34.383
Doesn't he? Doesn't he?

10:57.180 --> 10:58.853
Can I help you?

11:01.301 --> 11:02.503
Yeah. Um...

11:03.470 --> 11:05.180
I'm looking for a suit.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.519
Can I get you anything else?
Coffee...?

11:11.607 --> 11:13.321
- No. I'm good, thanks.
- Okay.

11:13.409 --> 11:15.475
Wait. Come. Sit.

11:15.855 --> 11:17.573
- Join me.
- Oh, I, um...

11:17.661 --> 11:18.717
Your shift is over, Lucy.

11:18.805 --> 11:20.472
I heard you say that
to the other lady.

11:20.622 --> 11:22.720
Mm. Also heard her
call you Lucy,

11:22.808 --> 11:25.375
just...
so you know I'm not a stalker.

11:25.806 --> 11:27.405
Come sit.

11:31.765 --> 11:33.036
Mmm.

11:33.202 --> 11:35.006
This is amazing bacon here.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.197
This is great for a hangover.

11:37.643 --> 11:39.113
Why are you hungover?

11:39.339 --> 11:40.827
I'm hungover,
'cause, last night,

11:40.915 --> 11:42.330
I was writing a song

11:42.916 --> 11:44.226
and...

11:44.314 --> 11:46.229
I realized
I completely suck

11:46.317 --> 11:48.161
and I'm gonna be
playing cocktail lounges

11:48.249 --> 11:50.156
and country clubs for
the rest of my life.

11:52.135 --> 11:53.492
You're a musician?

11:54.104 --> 11:55.566
I'm trying.

11:57.777 --> 11:59.292
It's bright in here.

12:00.175 --> 12:01.834
- How do you...
- I can see some light.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.590
Just a little.
And, um...

12:04.651 --> 12:07.425
and really, really blurry shapes

12:07.513 --> 12:09.052
but nothing clearly.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.182
- Mm.
- I've been here a few times,

12:11.270 --> 12:12.679
but never for breakfast.

12:12.836 --> 12:14.385
Can you describe it for me?

12:15.019 --> 12:16.125
The restaurant?

12:16.213 --> 12:17.279
Yeah.

12:18.162 --> 12:19.995
Yeah, it's, uh...

12:21.634 --> 12:22.712
..it's one of those diners

12:22.800 --> 12:24.924
that will...
never change.

12:25.716 --> 12:27.423
It's not what I would open.

12:27.550 --> 12:28.608
I'm a chef.

12:28.696 --> 12:31.730
Or... I want to be a chef,
I should say.

12:32.611 --> 12:34.312
But it's...

12:35.230 --> 12:37.039
warm here, you know?
It's...

12:38.040 --> 12:40.542
The food is warm,
the people are warm,

12:40.630 --> 12:42.904
the... room is literally
always warm,

12:42.992 --> 12:44.379
even when it's super cold out.

12:45.006 --> 12:46.189
Yeah.

12:52.052 --> 12:53.341
May I?

12:57.812 --> 12:59.011
Sure.

13:15.363 --> 13:16.682
Damn.

13:20.905 --> 13:23.039
I think
I'll have another cup of coffee.

13:28.396 --> 13:29.871
Okay.

13:32.623 --> 13:33.866
She sleep through the night?

13:34.131 --> 13:36.496
- Not really.
- 'Cause you woke her.

13:36.584 --> 13:38.269
Told you
not to, and you woke her.

13:38.357 --> 13:40.739
- Would you leave him alone, woman?
- "Woman"?

13:41.234 --> 13:43.483
I'm sorry,
you plan on kissing me

13:43.571 --> 13:44.800
with that mouth today?

13:45.030 --> 13:47.296
That is definitely the plan,
yeah.

13:49.103 --> 13:51.593
Grandma and Grandpa
are cheesy as hell.

13:51.688 --> 13:54.208
We've earned our cheese,
thank you kindly.

13:54.296 --> 13:55.956
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm working the night shift

13:56.044 --> 13:57.263
at the hotel tonight,
Malik.

13:57.363 --> 13:58.562
Be home by 5:00.

13:58.650 --> 13:59.748
- 5:00?
- Mm-hmm.

13:59.836 --> 14:02.240
Yes, I know
all about Andre's barbecue.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.338
You're watching the baby.
Welcome to responsibility.

14:05.434 --> 14:07.593
Don't start.
Now, go to work.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.826
Both of you.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.287
Hey.

14:10.606 --> 14:12.402
Promise to shine
that beautiful light of yours

14:12.489 --> 14:14.068
onto the world today?

14:16.905 --> 14:18.709
What about you, husband?

14:20.054 --> 14:21.269
For you?

14:21.658 --> 14:23.580
I'll give it everything I got.

14:26.580 --> 14:28.728
Yeah, cheesy as hell.

14:28.816 --> 14:30.245
Hmm...

14:34.496 --> 14:37.473
You don't need a suit
for a country club.

14:38.313 --> 14:40.772
Navy sports coat is
a much better play.

14:41.185 --> 14:42.646
It'll get you anywhere.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.949
Yeah. Mark my words,

14:45.037 --> 14:46.826
you <i> will</i> be sleeping in this.

14:47.586 --> 14:49.586
Looks good.
Fits you perfect.

14:51.598 --> 14:55.319
You know, I... I just
got back from 'Nam,

14:55.454 --> 14:56.797
and...

14:56.931 --> 14:59.053
haven't quite landed a job yet,
so...

14:59.141 --> 15:01.290
Oh, uh, yeah,
I get it.

15:01.794 --> 15:05.138
Yeah. Somehow my number
didn't get called.

15:05.386 --> 15:06.791
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:07.002 --> 15:09.008
Puerto Rican kid whose
number doesn't get called.

15:09.096 --> 15:10.978
You ever hear of something so crazy?

15:14.543 --> 15:16.269
Look, we're not, uh...

15:17.338 --> 15:20.066
we're not tailoring this thing, right?

15:20.859 --> 15:23.968
So why don't you take it,
tuck the tag up in the sleeve

15:24.056 --> 15:25.856
when you wear it, and
bring it back next week.

15:26.412 --> 15:27.734
Really?

15:28.291 --> 15:30.650
This girl,
she's worth it?

15:31.845 --> 15:34.614
Oh, man,
she's like no one you've ever seen.

16:08.626 --> 16:10.636
- Lasher.
- Roger that.

16:10.724 --> 16:13.073
- Waters. You're with me.
- I got it.

16:13.161 --> 16:14.863
All right, guys, listen up.

16:15.048 --> 16:17.120
Go ahead and set up a cordon
around the building.

16:20.030 --> 16:21.037
<i>As-salaam alaikum.</i>

16:21.125 --> 16:22.724
<i>Wa-alaikum-salaam.</i>

16:24.619 --> 16:26.066
<i>Dalta rasha.</i>

16:39.901 --> 16:41.178
Lasher.

16:41.528 --> 16:42.710
What's up?

16:42.798 --> 16:45.198
- Put a guy at the door.
- Ortiz!

16:45.637 --> 16:46.920
Post up here.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.145
We're losing daylight.

16:49.292 --> 16:50.765
I'm not gonna have my guys
in a row

16:50.862 --> 16:52.502
in the middle of the night
in IED country.

16:52.609 --> 16:54.293
You got five minutes.

16:58.453 --> 17:02.037
Asmaan, you promised me
a photo of Mohammad Nadir.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.351
I haven't received anything.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.932
I haven't even heard from you.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.156
<i>Speaking Arabic...</i>

17:11.195 --> 17:12.232
She says she's nervous.

17:12.319 --> 17:13.195
- People are watching her.
- I know.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.214
- She's scared.
- You need to think about your child.

17:18.294 --> 17:19.915
Tell her to look at me,
not you, when she speaks.

17:23.931 --> 17:25.470
Nadir, the bomb maker,

17:25.599 --> 17:27.258
I need his photo.
The longer we are here,

17:27.346 --> 17:29.156
the more danger
we are all in.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.038
If this dog keeps barking,
I'm gonna shoot it.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.209
You're not gonna do anything
till I tell you to, Marine.

17:40.296 --> 17:41.597
We had a deal.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.506
An immigrant visa and
an expedited process.

17:44.888 --> 17:46.771
If I leave here
without that photo,

17:46.859 --> 17:48.097
you get nothing.

17:50.178 --> 17:51.593
- Sergeant.
- I see 'em.

17:51.681 --> 17:53.095
<i>One Bravo, Echo Main.</i>

17:53.292 --> 17:54.774
Echo Main, this is One Bravo.

17:54.862 --> 17:58.360
<i>Be advised ISR spotted
12 military-age males</i>

17:58.478 --> 18:00.994
<i>moving towards your
location, possibly enemy QRF.</i>

18:01.081 --> 18:02.612
- <i>How copy?</i>
- Asmaan.

18:03.323 --> 18:05.323
<i>Speaking Arabic...</i>

18:06.809 --> 18:08.113
She's asking for water
for the village.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.360
That's more than fair.
I can get water for the village.

18:10.527 --> 18:12.607
All right, Asmaan, I need
you to calm down that baby.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.528
Hey, Sharp! Wrap it up!

18:19.779 --> 18:21.032
Asmaan, there's no more time.

18:21.692 --> 18:22.826
I'm a mother, too.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.227
I have a son...
I would do anything to protect him.

18:26.315 --> 18:27.762
Anything. Just like you.

18:27.977 --> 18:30.406
Your patients here,
they are mothers and they are children.

18:30.811 --> 18:32.393
Nadir is a murderer.

18:32.855 --> 18:34.681
He is hiding amongst you.

18:34.999 --> 18:36.373
You give me that photo,

18:36.461 --> 18:38.810
or the entire village pays,
including you and your child.

18:39.711 --> 18:41.445
Look at me. Stay with me.

18:41.533 --> 18:43.063
Hey, look at me!

18:43.350 --> 18:44.965
Do you think I'm playing?

18:45.480 --> 18:46.928
Do you hear me?

18:47.127 --> 18:48.664
You have five seconds.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.053
Five.

18:51.435 --> 18:52.783
Four.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.579
Three.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.825
Two.

19:01.294 --> 19:02.925
Okay, give it to me.

19:05.713 --> 19:07.328
We'll be in touch
about the visa.

19:07.424 --> 19:09.813
- Water?
- And the water.

19:11.204 --> 19:12.503
Let's go.

19:13.937 --> 19:15.054
All right!

19:15.142 --> 19:16.557
Let's mount up!

19:35.783 --> 19:37.020
Thank you.

19:38.690 --> 19:41.293
- Oh! He's here.
- Oh! He's here.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.403
Hi.

19:42.491 --> 19:44.071
Hey.

19:44.389 --> 19:45.489
Um, I want to,

19:45.577 --> 19:47.635
But there
are eyes everywhere.

19:48.064 --> 19:49.604
- Okay, got it.
- Okay,

19:49.692 --> 19:51.142
so, it's my parents
and their best friends.

19:51.229 --> 19:52.852
My mom is... tough,

19:53.012 --> 19:55.046
I'm not gonna lie,
but my dad

19:55.134 --> 19:57.612
saves all,
and he's gonna absolutely love you.

19:57.785 --> 19:58.870
Okay.

19:58.963 --> 20:00.517
I like your jacket, by the way.

20:00.605 --> 20:01.791
Oh, this old thing?

20:01.879 --> 20:05.026
Oh, and I did tell them,
under no circumstances

20:05.114 --> 20:07.682
are they to bring up
anything about Vietnam, so...

20:08.496 --> 20:09.769
- Thanks.
- Okay.

20:10.189 --> 20:11.357
Everyone...

20:12.119 --> 20:13.852
this is the famous Jack.

20:14.388 --> 20:16.762
Famous or infamous?

20:16.977 --> 20:18.832
Taking my daughter
across the country

20:18.934 --> 20:21.517
just a week after meeting her
seems to land...

20:21.946 --> 20:24.213
squarely
in the infamous territory.

20:24.301 --> 20:26.149
Well, now, honey, he took her

20:26.237 --> 20:28.288
for two weeks,
but he brought her back in one piece,

20:28.376 --> 20:30.124
so he can't be all bad.

20:30.769 --> 20:32.841
Very nice to meet you,
Jack. Sit, sit, please.

20:32.929 --> 20:34.817
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

20:37.316 --> 20:38.830
So...

20:39.282 --> 20:41.953
I heard
you just returned from Vietnam.

20:48.402 --> 20:50.288
It was just
a little fender bender.

20:50.376 --> 20:51.921
I can't... I don't know

20:52.009 --> 20:53.864
- how I'm going to pay.
- Let me see what I can do.

20:53.951 --> 20:55.825
You pay what you can
when you can.

20:55.957 --> 20:57.239
Thank you.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.546
- Hey.
- Yo.

21:01.762 --> 21:04.024
Haven't you seen by the spot
in a minute.

21:04.809 --> 21:05.990
Yeah, I been busy.

21:06.148 --> 21:08.297
Man, you're a Boy Scout now.

21:08.385 --> 21:09.566
It's all good.

21:10.023 --> 21:11.350
The kid has your car in the back.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.938
Custom work's his department.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.346
- All right. Good seeing you.
- You, too.

21:26.652 --> 21:27.747
Yeah?

21:28.025 --> 21:29.336
Sharp?

21:30.891 --> 21:33.095
Nadir came back to the village
a few hours ago.

21:33.498 --> 21:35.453
- Predator drone took him out.
- What?

21:35.949 --> 21:39.077
I-I... thought the point
was ID him, take him quietly.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.745
He's just gonna be replaced
in a week.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.875
Yeah. Well, headquarters seems
to like to play Whac-A-Mole.

21:44.785 --> 21:46.394
How many civilian deaths?

21:46.482 --> 21:48.420
Eight dead,
12 or more so wounded.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.230
Strike caught
the back side of a building.

21:50.351 --> 21:52.234
We think bags of fertilizer
were inside,

21:52.322 --> 21:54.737
because the blast radius
wasn't supposed to be so big.

21:54.998 --> 21:56.446
Your asset survived.

21:56.597 --> 21:58.710
We're working on a visa
for her and her kid.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.953
Gunny.

22:03.091 --> 22:05.325
I promised her water
for the village.

22:06.310 --> 22:07.989
There's no more village, Sharp.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.143
to the communists just
like Ike said they would.

25:42.231 --> 25:45.213
I don't recall hearing any
congressional declaration.

25:45.579 --> 25:47.057
Wasn't even a real war.

25:47.236 --> 25:49.413
- Honey? Stop.
- Well...

25:49.501 --> 25:50.854
Enough. Enough war.

25:51.028 --> 25:52.246
- Uh...
- Yuck.

25:52.334 --> 25:53.819
Happier topics.

25:54.853 --> 25:56.979
So, Jack, it must be nice for you

25:57.067 --> 25:59.616
to just take off cross-country
at a moment's notice.

25:59.703 --> 26:02.282
You must come from a wealthy family

26:02.370 --> 26:04.385
to fund all that wanderlust.

26:05.435 --> 26:07.257
What do your parents do?

26:07.858 --> 26:09.431
Um...

26:12.126 --> 26:13.997
I'm sorry.
Was that inappropriate?

26:14.168 --> 26:16.656
Jack, looks like you
took a little fire there.

26:20.794 --> 26:23.445
Um, I should probably go clean this up.

26:23.533 --> 26:25.543
Mm. The restroom is to the left.

26:25.631 --> 26:28.011
- Do you need me to come show...?
- No, no, no, no. I'm-I'm okay.

26:28.099 --> 26:29.566
Excuse me.

26:33.854 --> 26:36.455
Dad?
What the hell?

26:39.153 --> 26:40.748
It's good work, kid.

26:43.372 --> 26:44.685
Damn good.

26:44.773 --> 26:46.451
Thank you.

26:52.332 --> 26:55.104
Um, M-Mr. Castillo,
look, I-I know you, um...

26:55.343 --> 26:58.374
I know you have a business
of your own, right, and, uh,

26:58.471 --> 27:00.219
- look, if you ever need anything...
- Whoa.

27:01.729 --> 27:03.559
You're Darnell's kid.

27:03.670 --> 27:06.130
And Darnell's kid
and my business are not a fit.

27:10.526 --> 27:12.010
Hey, look.

27:12.401 --> 27:16.351
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm
Darnell's kid, but, uh...

27:16.697 --> 27:18.310
man, um...

27:18.960 --> 27:22.062
I'm-I'm also raising a
kid of my own, and, um...

27:24.659 --> 27:25.935
...she's special.

27:26.462 --> 27:29.270
I-I've been looking up
the best schools.

27:29.473 --> 27:31.373
And it's like ten K,

27:31.563 --> 27:33.199
ten K for pre-K.

27:33.620 --> 27:36.412
I mean, my-my parents
do fine, but, come on.

27:36.499 --> 27:38.896
Even you know
they don't do that fine.

27:39.893 --> 27:41.620
I need to earn real money

27:42.771 --> 27:44.282
for her.

27:49.478 --> 27:51.076
I got your number.

27:51.683 --> 27:53.817
I'll call you
when you can grow a mustache.

28:14.904 --> 28:16.588
Breathe.

28:18.096 --> 28:19.692
Breathe, Jack.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.291
- Oh, so many...
- Didn't you work here once?

28:24.378 --> 28:25.460
I did.

28:25.593 --> 28:27.207
Sorry. Sorry about that.

28:27.359 --> 28:29.230
- Okay?
- Yeah.

28:29.695 --> 28:31.706
To be honest,
I've never had lobster.

28:31.841 --> 28:33.487
- Oh.
- Kind of got the best of me.

28:37.318 --> 28:39.754
My parents don't do much, ma'am,

28:39.850 --> 28:41.549
in answer to your question.

28:43.164 --> 28:44.188
I mean, my dad...

28:44.276 --> 28:46.458
he-he's in door-to-door sales,

28:46.546 --> 28:50.375
but mostly
what my folks do is fight.

28:51.958 --> 28:53.520
He hits, she cries.

28:53.607 --> 28:56.096
That's... that's what they do.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.851
I had, uh...

28:59.267 --> 29:00.498
a little brother.

29:01.356 --> 29:02.547
Um...

29:03.739 --> 29:05.583
Basically raised him myself.

29:06.784 --> 29:08.265
When he was l-little,

29:09.301 --> 29:11.905
he had this two-year phase

29:12.138 --> 29:14.437
where he was convinced

29:14.524 --> 29:16.591
there was a monster
living in his closet.

29:18.769 --> 29:21.318
I couldn't convince him
that there was no monster,

29:21.421 --> 29:24.337
so instead, I would sit in
front of his closet door,

29:24.504 --> 29:26.705
and I'd tell the monster stories.

29:28.472 --> 29:30.524
I'd tell it bedtime stories

29:30.943 --> 29:33.293
until Nicky was convinced

29:33.400 --> 29:36.109
that the monster had gone to sleep,

29:36.530 --> 29:38.564
and it wasn't gonna
bother him anymore.

29:39.208 --> 29:40.651
Yeah.

29:42.457 --> 29:43.936
Of course, the monster wasn't real,

29:44.023 --> 29:46.819
but my brother's fear...

29:48.227 --> 29:49.679
that was real.

29:51.897 --> 29:54.597
The sweat on his forehead
was real.

29:56.950 --> 29:59.117
My brother's experience was real.

30:02.535 --> 30:04.535
I lost my brother in Vietnam.

30:09.606 --> 30:11.229
People died.

30:11.630 --> 30:12.973
People that I loved.

30:13.500 --> 30:15.933
So, due respect,

30:16.295 --> 30:19.803
it may not seem like
a real war back here,

30:19.890 --> 30:22.906
but I promise you,
that war was very real

30:23.190 --> 30:25.061
for those of us
who were there.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.418
I know...

30:36.135 --> 30:38.550
a stranger taking your daughter
cross-country

30:38.638 --> 30:41.093
might not have been
your favorite thing.

30:41.996 --> 30:45.129
And I'm sorry that was your
first impression of me, but...

30:45.381 --> 30:46.707
don't worry.

30:47.135 --> 30:48.653
You'll get to know me.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.862
I'm not going anywhere.

30:56.511 --> 30:58.370
Oh, I got to say,

30:59.268 --> 31:01.422
I think
I might be a lobster guy, Bec.

31:35.896 --> 31:36.959
Hey.

31:37.047 --> 31:38.110
Hey.

31:42.545 --> 31:43.770
Been drinking?

31:44.541 --> 31:47.875
I needed a few after another day
of looking for jobs.

31:47.963 --> 31:49.657
Needed more than a few,
actually.

31:51.642 --> 31:52.898
Well, hey,

31:53.685 --> 31:55.248
at least you're finally out, huh?

31:55.336 --> 31:56.449
Yay for me.

32:02.134 --> 32:03.849
Did you drive home drunk?

32:05.004 --> 32:06.559
I don't need a lecture.

32:07.994 --> 32:10.304
Well, hey,
don't have one prepared.

32:12.801 --> 32:15.216
Somehow I missed the last
credit card statement.

32:15.303 --> 32:16.899
We're gonna have to pay a late fee.

32:17.190 --> 32:19.712
Well, that's because you keep
piling the mail on the counter

32:19.800 --> 32:21.500
even though
I keep telling you not to.

32:24.995 --> 32:26.886
I'm doing the best
I can here, Cass.

32:26.974 --> 32:30.098
I'm-I'm... I'm taking
care of everything,

32:30.185 --> 32:32.829
I'm practically
raising Matty alone.

32:32.948 --> 32:34.989
Must be nice to have it so easy.

32:35.152 --> 32:36.937
- Do you have any idea...?
- No, no. I don't.

32:37.024 --> 32:38.652
I don't because
you won't talk to me.

32:38.740 --> 32:41.559
Mom? Mom, come here!
I made a car out of Legos!

32:41.647 --> 32:43.763
Matty, give me a second.
Mommy just got home.

32:43.851 --> 32:46.466
Oh, and the, uh...
the hot water heater broke again.

32:46.553 --> 32:47.962
- Again?
- Mom, come on!

32:48.051 --> 32:49.427
- Come on, Mom!
- Matty, please, come on.

32:49.514 --> 32:52.261
I asked about getting it replaced,
but it's expensive.

32:52.349 --> 32:53.827
It's 12 hundred bucks.

32:54.081 --> 32:55.244
Can you believe that?

32:55.332 --> 32:56.909
$1,200 for a water heater?

33:02.249 --> 33:04.242
Mom? Mom?!

33:06.578 --> 33:10.013
Mommy? Mommy? Mom! Mom.

33:14.140 --> 33:16.104
- Mom?
- Stop!

33:18.913 --> 33:20.580
Sor...

33:21.301 --> 33:22.778
Matty.

33:23.849 --> 33:26.863
- Matty, I'm so sorry. I...
- Um... no, no.

33:27.449 --> 33:28.861
Get out.

33:28.982 --> 33:31.628
- I didn't... I didn't...
- Just get out of this house.

33:45.707 --> 33:47.690
I'm gonna go to the restroom,
I'll be right back.

33:47.778 --> 33:49.248
- I'll get the coats.
- Okay.

33:50.496 --> 33:51.943
Young man,

33:52.411 --> 33:56.011
you know, you walked in here
tonight a bit of an underdog,

33:56.082 --> 33:57.529
to put it mildly.

33:57.712 --> 33:59.476
But you had yourself quite
an evening.

33:59.587 --> 34:02.009
You made a bunch of fans.

34:02.097 --> 34:04.910
Thank you, sir.
Just need the one.

34:04.998 --> 34:06.285
Ah.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.422
You know,
first year of her life,

34:09.629 --> 34:13.188
she only stopped crying
if I held her.

34:13.498 --> 34:15.317
Not her mother, not her sister.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.105
Just me.

34:17.597 --> 34:21.101
And everyone would say
"Oh, she's a Daddy's girl."

34:21.188 --> 34:22.658
And I said, "No.

34:23.175 --> 34:25.630
She is her daddy's world."

34:26.146 --> 34:28.156
Oh, and she still is.

34:30.103 --> 34:31.429
You're a good man, Jack.

34:31.676 --> 34:32.909
I can see that.

34:33.782 --> 34:37.505
I can also see a man who
is carrying things with him.

34:38.295 --> 34:39.366
And I can see a man

34:39.454 --> 34:43.322
who is far more haunted
than he wants to let on.

34:44.731 --> 34:45.818
I don't follow.

34:45.906 --> 34:49.362
I want more for her
than you can offer, Jack.

34:49.813 --> 34:53.230
I will do everything I can
to stop this.

34:53.478 --> 34:55.824
And make no mistake
about this, son.

34:56.503 --> 35:00.316
I'm a lot harder to beat than
an imaginary monster in a closet.

35:02.174 --> 35:04.837
Oh, goodness,
I barely ate, I was so nervous.

35:04.925 --> 35:06.783
- Daddy, thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

35:06.871 --> 35:07.792
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you for dinner.

35:07.879 --> 35:08.911
I love you to death,

35:08.999 --> 35:11.032
but Jack, can you take me
to go get a burger, please?

35:11.119 --> 35:12.686
- Absolutely.
- Okay. Good night, Dad.

35:12.774 --> 35:14.009

What, you feeling your age,
old man?

37:35.222 --> 37:36.878
Watch it.

37:40.564 --> 37:41.948
I see you roll your eyes

37:42.035 --> 37:44.775
every time your moms gets on you
about responsibility.

37:45.422 --> 37:46.848
I get it.

37:47.650 --> 37:49.250
Responsibility.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.658
For me, it was always
a pain in the ass word.

37:54.913 --> 37:56.654
When I was young,
it meant doing chores.

37:56.741 --> 37:58.504
As I got older,
it meant not getting to do

37:58.592 --> 38:00.054
the stuff I really wanted to do.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.807
I was going down a wrong path
in my 20s.

38:08.226 --> 38:10.003
Then your mom got pregnant.

38:11.912 --> 38:13.320
And being responsible,

38:13.652 --> 38:15.657
setting the right example
for you,

38:16.614 --> 38:18.084
it saved me.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.262
That's when I realized

38:20.349 --> 38:23.153
"responsibility" didn't have
to be a pain in the ass word.

38:26.365 --> 38:27.469
Son.

38:28.166 --> 38:29.532
Hey.

38:31.796 --> 38:33.563
Don't even think about it.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.724
A'ight?

38:41.157 --> 38:42.584
Yeah.

38:43.436 --> 38:44.671
A'ight.

38:46.481 --> 38:47.775
I'll watch the baby.

38:47.863 --> 38:49.372
I'll talk to your mother.

38:49.511 --> 38:51.527
But you're going to
Andre's barbecue.

38:51.685 --> 38:52.868
No, no, no, I-I...

38:52.956 --> 38:55.939
Son,
your life is not over.

38:56.475 --> 38:57.706
You're still a young man,

38:57.794 --> 38:59.533
you still have friends
that have barbecues,

38:59.620 --> 39:03.156
and, on occasion,
your wonderful father...

39:03.959 --> 39:05.595
I'm down to babysit.

39:06.327 --> 39:08.400
Get some QT
with my granddaughter.

39:09.090 --> 39:10.510
W-Wait, are you sure?

39:10.783 --> 39:12.563
You're making
breakfast tomorrow.

39:12.763 --> 39:14.740
And you better not half-ass it,
either.

39:14.842 --> 39:16.209
I want the full deal.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.252
Western omelets
and hash browns.

39:18.419 --> 39:20.421
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah, okay. Okay.

39:20.509 --> 39:21.821
Yeah.

39:26.707 --> 39:28.589
I used to sing here
all the time,

39:28.677 --> 39:31.512
and they basically paid me

39:39.798 --> 39:41.567
You know,
it's open Mic tonight.

39:41.737 --> 39:43.770
Place is pretty dead, so...

39:43.968 --> 39:45.472
You want to dust off
an old one for us?

39:45.559 --> 39:46.640
No, no, no, I'm okay.

39:46.728 --> 39:48.260
- We're actually just gonna...
- Yes.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.626
It's-it's been a day.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.241
I could use a song
from my favorite singer.

39:53.886 --> 39:54.933
<i>So...</i>

39:55.021 --> 39:57.116
the drinking's become a thing.

39:57.203 --> 39:58.969
It started a few years ago.

39:59.462 --> 40:02.439
It's only gotten worse
since I've been out of the Corps.

40:04.809 --> 40:06.549
My husband and I are...

40:07.042 --> 40:08.957
separated, I guess.

40:09.648 --> 40:11.749
My life's at a standstill.

40:12.610 --> 40:15.226
Actually, that's a lie.
It's...

40:15.805 --> 40:17.195
moving in reverse.

40:17.490 --> 40:20.206
I went from working
in classified settings

40:20.294 --> 40:21.875
to driving around
college students

40:21.963 --> 40:23.598
on a Saturday night for Uber.

40:23.749 --> 40:25.936
No offense to Uber drivers.

40:29.328 --> 40:30.715
I...

40:30.845 --> 40:34.269
I can't... feel anything.

40:34.805 --> 40:37.221
I can't feel sadness.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.390
I certainly can't feel joy.

40:39.924 --> 40:42.141
And I hate throwing
around the term PTSD,

40:42.229 --> 40:43.351
and I know you guys
will probably tell me

40:43.438 --> 40:45.305
that that's what this is,
but...

40:46.261 --> 40:47.735
But when I hit him...

40:54.767 --> 40:56.420
When I hit my son,

40:57.495 --> 41:01.941
I can't
blame PTSD or alcohol or Uber.

41:05.102 --> 41:07.700
It was the cost
of a water heater.

41:09.922 --> 41:11.461
Just brought me right back.

41:11.618 --> 41:12.815
On behalf of the U.S. government,

41:12.902 --> 41:14.726
we'd like to present to you
these condolence payments

41:14.813 --> 41:16.710
for every civilian that
was killed yesterday.

41:17.220 --> 41:19.616
$1,200 U.S. per person.

41:31.425 --> 41:33.419
<i>You guys
know we do that, right?</i>

41:33.776 --> 41:35.270
Dead civilian.

41:35.531 --> 41:36.859
Dead kids.

41:37.932 --> 41:39.594
$1,200 per person.

41:39.682 --> 41:42.384
That's the price of a
life over there. That's...

41:42.730 --> 41:44.962
a price of a water heater.

41:45.721 --> 41:47.636
So when I think about that...

42:02.663 --> 42:05.466
Don't know where Toby
and Kate put their dishes.

42:05.554 --> 42:07.559
- They've barely even unpacked.
- I will find them.

42:07.743 --> 42:09.030
Guess whose birthday

42:09.118 --> 42:11.144
- it is, huh?
- Hi.

42:11.255 --> 42:12.645
- Birthday cake.
- No, no, no, no.

42:12.733 --> 42:13.702
Don't touch the cake.

42:13.790 --> 42:15.197
We're waiting for
your sister and Toby.

42:15.284 --> 42:16.488
- Yeah?
- Happy birthday.

42:16.576 --> 42:17.378
Thank you, Mom.
You know,

42:17.466 --> 42:18.354
I came out first.
I feel like

42:18.441 --> 42:19.508
I should be able
to eat the cake first.

42:19.595 --> 42:21.144
No one's eating
any cake yet.

42:21.232 --> 42:22.313
We're waiting for your sister.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.828
Hello?

42:25.251 --> 42:26.694
Yeah.

42:26.782 --> 42:28.254
Uh, no. Yeah.

42:28.381 --> 42:31.183
Okay. Uh, no.
No, of course. Yeah.

42:31.271 --> 42:33.975
Um... I...

42:34.251 --> 42:35.957
H-Hold on one second.

42:36.663 --> 42:38.107
It's Uncle Nicky.
He got in trouble

42:38.195 --> 42:39.602
in Pennsylvania,
he's being arrested

42:39.690 --> 42:42.102
and he gave them
my number for the bail money.

42:45.378 --> 42:46.992
What's up, what's up, what's up?

42:47.302 --> 42:48.673
Hey, man.

42:48.810 --> 42:50.980
Hey. Hey.

42:51.202 --> 42:52.804
Hey, yo, Malik.

42:58.113 --> 42:59.235
Hey, Malik.

42:59.323 --> 43:00.909
Hey, Sky. What's up?

43:00.997 --> 43:02.720
Yo, I heard
you got into honors bio.

43:02.808 --> 43:04.356
That's what's up.

43:04.850 --> 43:07.043
Hey, I want to introduce you
to someone.

43:07.423 --> 43:09.553
This is my friend Deja.

43:09.641 --> 43:10.989
She just moved here.

43:11.077 --> 43:12.524
She's starting school tomorrow.

43:12.612 --> 43:15.993
Uh... Hi, hi, hi, Deja.

43:16.081 --> 43:18.213
Um, Malik.
Nice to meet you.

43:18.301 --> 43:21.117
Um, Sky says
you make a good burger.

43:21.205 --> 43:23.154
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, I-I make a...

43:23.329 --> 43:25.411
I make a decent,
decent burger.

43:27.617 --> 43:30.251
But-but for you,
I'll give it everything I got.

43:47.830 --> 43:49.515
Sorry I'm late.

43:50.670 --> 43:51.694
Hey, Dej.

43:51.790 --> 43:52.908
Hmm?

43:55.902 --> 43:57.911
What's happening with your face?

43:58.739 --> 44:02.045
What?
Um, nothing.

44:10.301 --> 44:11.755
All right, here's the plan.

44:11.845 --> 44:13.394
I'll take a break and
stay home with him.

44:13.481 --> 44:15.347
- Or her.
- Okay.

44:17.384 --> 44:19.624
Tobe, no matter what he says,

44:20.470 --> 44:22.839
he's gonna have an
amazing, incredible life.

44:23.757 --> 44:25.192
Yes, he will,
because he has

44:25.280 --> 44:27.423
an amazing, incredible
mother who's going to give him

44:27.511 --> 44:29.316
all of her amazing,
incredible traits.

44:29.549 --> 44:31.411
His dad's not so bad.

44:31.511 --> 44:33.727
- Is he? Huh?
- Yeah.

44:33.861 --> 44:35.980
Well, maybe his dad will
give him his sense of humor.

44:36.068 --> 44:38.016
But please, God, please,
please, please, God,

44:38.104 --> 44:39.658
not his hairline.

44:39.869 --> 44:42.618
Grow some hair, please.

44:42.744 --> 44:45.322
You crush it at the restaurant,
and if you can make it home

44:45.426 --> 44:46.341
every once in a while
to see him...

44:46.429 --> 44:48.120
- Or her.
- Okay.

44:48.363 --> 44:50.545
Well, that's great,
but it's not required.

44:50.774 --> 44:53.395
Okay, guys.

44:59.257 --> 45:00.815
So...

45:02.306 --> 45:05.329
Nothing's really changed
since the last procedure.

45:06.003 --> 45:09.430
Jack is still not following
cues or responding to tests.

45:09.785 --> 45:11.699
I know it's been a long three months,

45:11.995 --> 45:14.171
but now it's time to move forward.

45:14.671 --> 45:16.832
<i>Jack's retinopathy will not be reversed.</i>

45:17.045 --> 45:19.182
<i>His eyesight will not return.</i>

45:19.878 --> 45:21.515
Okay, we're here.

45:23.579 --> 45:26.197
The good news is
it's not total stage V.

45:26.387 --> 45:28.027
He will be able to see some light,

45:28.114 --> 45:29.605
<i>maybe some shapes.</i>

45:30.654 --> 45:32.003
Am I lined up?

45:32.882 --> 45:34.063
You're perfect.

45:34.263 --> 45:35.721
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:35.809 --> 45:37.443
Jack Damon.

45:56.410 --> 45:57.768
Hi.

46:02.493 --> 46:05.054
Good evening.
Hello. Sorry to interrupt.

46:05.221 --> 46:06.868
Um...

46:07.066 --> 46:09.048
I would like to dedicate
this song

46:09.385 --> 46:12.738
to a man
who was a total stranger

46:12.826 --> 46:14.216
just a few weeks ago.

46:14.661 --> 46:16.938
I may be only Pittsburgh good,

46:17.355 --> 46:19.437
but, my God,

46:19.938 --> 46:23.336
he makes me feel like
one day,

46:23.750 --> 46:25.292
I will stand

46:25.380 --> 46:27.447
on the biggest stage
in the world.
