00:26.280 --> 00:29.720
(O'Neill) You know that UAV
needs a swift kick in the CPU.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.200
Its aerial camera
showed some sort of camp.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.280
(explosions)

00:34.760 --> 00:36.680
We're drawing weapons fire.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.360
Clearly a staff-weapon blast.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.720
(fire continues)

01:08.880 --> 01:10.800
It's an SG team, sir.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.760
I can't make out their unit number.
They're pinned down.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.960
- They are not returning fire.
- Out of ammo?

01:22.120 --> 01:24.040
Maybe.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.480
They're not supposed to be here at all.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.200
SG-1 1?

01:28.360 --> 01:31.240
They were declared MIA
eight months ago on P89-534.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.000
- What would they be doing here?
- Whoever they are, they are about to die.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.400
Unidentified Sierra Gulf unit,
this is Sierra Gulf One.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.120
We're on your six,
standing by to offer fire support. Over.

01:46.680 --> 01:50.400
Sierra Gulf unit,
your position's about to be overrun. Over.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.080
They're either on another frequency
or they don't have comms.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.080
RV at the tree line.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.160
Move. Now.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.080
Pull out! Cover your six!

02:24.240 --> 02:26.080
Identify yourself!

02:26.760 --> 02:30.120
- Colonel Jack O'Neill, SG-1 !
- Which quadrant?

02:30.280 --> 02:31.400
What?

02:33.960 --> 02:35.880
Get out of there!

02:36.160 --> 02:38.080
Take 'em out!

02:44.360 --> 02:46.280
(groans)

04:57.640 --> 04:59.560
Everybody OK?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.880
Headache. Bad headache.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.800
I thought I got shot.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.360
So it would seem.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.920
- Must be some kind of stun weapons.
- Looked like MP5s to me.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.760
Well, all I can say is...

05:34.960 --> 05:36.520
Hello.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.600
Boy, are you guys gonna get it.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.160
Get what? From whom?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.080
- You can't talk!
- Why not?

05:46.640 --> 05:48.560
Because you're dead.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.280
Dead?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.720
Pretending not to be dead
will just get you into more trouble.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.760
More trouble than dead?

05:58.920 --> 06:02.560
Come on, Colonel. You know better.
Stop breakin' the rules.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.640
Sorry.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.280
Who's in charge here?

06:06.440 --> 06:08.320
Casualties don't ask questions.

06:08.920 --> 06:09.440
Uh...

06:09.600 --> 06:12.160
What rules are we talking about exactly?

06:15.080 --> 06:17.000
I said stop!

06:17.960 --> 06:22.360
We don't understand. If we're meant to be
dead, how are you meant to kill us again?

06:22.520 --> 06:25.200
You wanna find out, four-eyes?

06:27.080 --> 06:29.680
- Four-eyes?
- Easy, big fella.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.280
Just play dead.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.680
Indeed.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.120
Captain's waiting for you. Follow me.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.280
Anyone notice the patch?

06:56.440 --> 06:58.320
SG-X.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.400
There is no SG-X, O'Neill.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.440
Not under Hammond's command, no.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.320
Hey!

07:04.480 --> 07:06.400
I said follow me.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.120
Hey, guys.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.160
- They are no more than children.
- Playing some war game, it looks like.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.280
Who do you think they are? NID?
Colonel Maybourne?

07:41.600 --> 07:44.160
I wouldn't put it past him.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.800
SG-1 , reporting as ordered, sir!

07:59.280 --> 08:01.720
You are all casualties until 1400 hours.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.880
Would that be daylight savings
or standard?

08:07.320 --> 08:12.240
You may not speak, except to answer
a direct question by the evaluating officer.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.480
Is that clear?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.120
Is this the way
you behave in your quadrant, mister?

08:28.080 --> 08:33.080
I think "Colonel" is the proper way
of addressing me... Captain.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.760
No rank is above strict adherence
to the rules of engagement.

08:36.919 --> 08:41.480
Rule 2, Article 4: unauthorised forces
shall be shot on sight.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.640
You were unauthorised.
And you ruined our ambush.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.960
- Nearly half of the enemy team got away.
- Carter, I've never been real big on regs.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.320
- Is this familiar to you?
- No, sir.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.080
They are familiar to me.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.880
Kal vak Jaffa.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.440
- You're not from D Quadrant.
- We are not.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.960
Then you came through the Chaapa-ai.
This is a challenge.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.040
The... Chaapa-ai?

09:12.560 --> 09:14.280
Oy.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.360
He meant the Stargate, sir.

09:18.280 --> 09:20.200
Stargate. Of course.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.200
We've been so long without challenges.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.360
I am sorry, Master Jaffa.
I have revealed myself and failed.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.920
You must execute me
for the remainder of the day.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.840
You must execute me as well.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.560
Master Teal'c?

09:55.800 --> 09:58.000
Might I suggest we...

09:58.880 --> 10:00.800
..spare them this time?

10:01.960 --> 10:04.040
Very well...

10:04.200 --> 10:06.120
..underling.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.200
Captain, your full name and rank.

10:11.200 --> 10:15.600
My Earth name is Captain Kyle Rogers.
Acting Quadrant A commander, sir!

10:16.480 --> 10:18.120
Your Earth name?

10:18.280 --> 10:20.680
Orders given you
by your previous Jaffa master?

10:21.240 --> 10:24.480
To practise battle according to
the rules of engagement...

10:24.640 --> 10:27.200
..until the return of our lord, Apophis.

10:28.800 --> 10:29.680
Really.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.520
When we are ready for
the final challenge, he will come.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.880
- Don't hold your breath.
- We will be ready.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.600
You're training to serve Apophis
wearing SG uniforms?

10:42.160 --> 10:45.160
To know the enemy.
Quadrant A has spared no detail.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.160
We've studied long and hard
and know much.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.160
- About Earth?
- Oh, yes.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.520
Corn and cotton
are indigenous to North America.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.320
That information
could save your life one day.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.520
So you see, Master Teal'c,
my mistake will not happen again.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.200
I will infiltrate the Tauri at your command.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.720
That time has not yet come,
Captain Rogers.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.560
So...

11:10.680 --> 11:12.600
If you're pretending to be...

11:15.120 --> 11:18.560
- Who were those Jaffa attacking you?
- They were led by my deputy.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.960
Captain Nelson.
As part of the daily exercise.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.480
We have kept the Jaffa camp separate,
the better to practise Earth behaviour.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.520
- Shall I have him sent for?
- No, I don't think that'll be necessary.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.960
- Send for him.
- Yes! Send for him.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.920
- How else may I serve?
- We'd like our weapons back.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.080
- The ones we came with.
- They were stored in the armoury tent.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.320
At the conclusion of today's war game.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.600
- Take us to them.
- As you wish.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.360
Colonel, none of them
have symbiote pouches.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.200
I noticed that.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.200
Before Apophis requested asylum...

12:10.360 --> 12:13.440
..only a handful of loyal Jaffa
remained in his service.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.520
So he drafted ordinary humans?

12:15.920 --> 12:19.880
It is common among the Goa'uld
to use humans as fodder during battle.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.680
Especially when facing defeat.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.240
- All right. We can handle it from here.
- I can assist you.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.440
Shal kek!

12:48.680 --> 12:51.000
Yes, Master.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.880
So, Teal'c... how do you know about
these rules of engagement?

12:55.120 --> 12:58.080
They are the code of battle
during a young Jaffa's training.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.920
Spoken by Apophis himself.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.080
Teal'c, what about these?

13:02.920 --> 13:04.360
They are intar.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.400
Short for...?

13:06.560 --> 13:08.480
Intar.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.120
They are used for training
and only meant to stun.

13:12.280 --> 13:16.280
They can be identified by this crystal.
They can take the form of any weapon.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.400
Well, I got our GDOs,
but my MP5's still missing.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.800
As is my staff weapon.

13:22.560 --> 13:26.520
All right, Teal'c, I want everyone
in one place - just to make sure.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.240
Can you handle that?

13:28.400 --> 13:30.080
I can.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.160
You two keep lookin'.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.760
Captain Rogers.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.320
Where are the weapons
with which we arrived?

13:45.480 --> 13:48.520
They were returned to
the armoury tent, of course.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.360
Do you possess a vo'cume?

13:53.520 --> 13:54.760
Yes, sir.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.280
Use it.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.360
Yes, Master Teal'c.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.760
What'd you tell him to do?

14:08.400 --> 14:12.400
I ordered him to use a training instrument
to assemble his men for inspection.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.000
It may serve to emphasise our authority.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.680
Whoa.

14:37.320 --> 14:42.440
Warriors of Apophis, assemble and listen
to he that possesses the vo'cume.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.760
Sir?

14:45.920 --> 14:50.040
Just a huge, honkin' Apophis, Major.
Nothing to worry about.

15:00.320 --> 15:04.200
The warrior before you
speaks in my name. Heed his words.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.680
I would be honoured if you would
inspect my warriors, Master.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.040
Company!

15:20.320 --> 15:22.240
Ready weapons for inspection.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.800
You do yourself proud, Captain Rogers.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.200
Master Teal'c?

15:50.400 --> 15:52.760
This is my second-in-command - No'var.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.400
For the games,
he leads the side of the Jaffa warriors.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.280
His Earth name is Captain Nelson.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.600
Most of my warriors
are engaged in battle, Master.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.520
I will relay your words to them
after the battle.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.200
Master Teal'c.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.440
If... I may?

16:12.520 --> 16:16.840
This is Colonel O'Neill.
He is much loved by Apophis.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.560
You may address the warriors.

16:23.960 --> 16:29.000
Apophis wanted me to tell you that
you've all been doing a wonderful job.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.680
Well done.

16:31.800 --> 16:36.200
But he also wanted me to tell you
that the whole invasion-of-the-Tauri idea...

16:36.360 --> 16:38.280
..has been cancelled, due to...

16:39.960 --> 16:41.280
..rain. Ahem!

16:43.240 --> 16:44.680
So.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.160
The war games are officially over
as of right...

16:49.360 --> 16:50.320
..now.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.280
You can all go home.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.640
Sir?

17:02.720 --> 17:06.720
It's over, Nelson.
Go tell your buddies to quit fighting.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.359
You speak more like a Tauri
than a warrior of Apophis.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.079
Well, thanks. You're not so bad yourself.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.560
Who taught you?

17:17.720 --> 17:21.960
If you are who you say you are,
you already know the answer to that, sir.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.440
Nelson, I am ordering you
to recall your men from the field.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.599
Article 7, Section 3 states...

17:27.760 --> 17:30.920
..that once the battle has commenced,
it cannot be stopped.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.680
Well, you're obviously
referring to the old Article 7.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.000
That's it.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.960
That means those kids are
playing war games with real weapons.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.960
- Colonel.
- Go ahead, Carter.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.320
So far all we've recovered
is one 9mm and one MP5.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.600
Roger that. Keep lookin'.

17:57.840 --> 18:02.960
Quadrant A must assemble, including
those engaged in games. Immediately!

18:03.120 --> 18:06.760
- As Captain Nelson stated, Master...
- Do you wish to be punished?

18:06.920 --> 18:10.480
I will not fail your challenge
a second time, Master Teal'c.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.360
Tell him the truth.

18:17.960 --> 18:21.080
Warriors of Apophis, hear me.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.160
Apophis has been slain
in battle with his enemies.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.000
Hey!

18:30.360 --> 18:32.280
He's telling you the truth.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.960
The battle you've been preparing for
is never gonna happen.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.040
He's not coming back.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.960
Is this mike on?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.720
We're trying to tell you
something important here!

18:44.880 --> 18:47.720
Apophis is a god. And gods cannot die.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.200
So he cannot be dead.

18:50.360 --> 18:54.560
Any anyone who says otherwise
is either testing us or is a traitor,...

18:54.720 --> 18:56.000
..sir.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.360
Now we've passed your challenge.

18:58.520 --> 19:03.280
If there's nothing else, sirs, we're
scheduled to join the games in progress.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.720
Company, dismissed!

19:13.200 --> 19:16.000
Apophis has lived for thousands of years.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.400
It is as if we said
the sun will never rise again.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.680
It just might not for some of those kids
if they don't wise up.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.040
What's going on?

19:38.480 --> 19:42.160
I'm trying to get a weapon, sir.
I'm already late. The games have started.

19:42.320 --> 19:47.520
Colonel, one MP5, Teal'c's staff weapon
and two 9mms are still unaccounted for.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.560
(horn blast)

19:49.720 --> 19:52.880
- What does that mean?
- It means my team needs reinforcements.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.960
No. The game is cancelled.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.040
You can't do that.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.080
I believe I can.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.200
Everybody grab an intar.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.480
It's a staff-weapon wound.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.280
He's dead, sir.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.520
Take cover!

20:42.960 --> 20:46.960
- Colonel! I'll draw his fire.
- Negative! That is a real weapon.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.880
- Apophis will protect me.
- I said stay down!

21:00.400 --> 21:02.560
- Secure that weapon!
- Yes, sir!

21:07.680 --> 21:09.560
Have I displeased Apophis?

21:09.720 --> 21:11.640
No.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.480
Apophis would be proud.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.560
This is the final challenge.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.480
What happened?

21:29.080 --> 21:32.200
The day has come, Nelson.
It's the final challenge.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.320
Blood has been shed.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.120
Prepare the men.
The challenge must begin at first light.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.200
Yes, sir.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.800
What's he talking about?
The final challenge?

21:58.160 --> 22:01.960
It is the day in a warrior's training
when first blood is shed,...

22:02.120 --> 22:04.040
..and the games become real.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.120
Oy.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.320
Colonel? We found something.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.880
Our weapons were all turned in
after the war games.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.560
Roger that. Keep 'em secure.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.520
How's he doing?

22:28.280 --> 22:29.920
Apophis will save him.

22:30.080 --> 22:34.720
Actually, no. There's nothing more we
can do for him as long as we stay here.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.920
There's probably internal injuries.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.480
So we'll take him back with us.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.840
- You cannot.
- For crying out loud.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.440
You know as well as I do that the rules
forbid entry or exit of the sector...

22:46.600 --> 22:49.560
..before the final challenge,
wounded or not.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.360
Right, right.

22:51.520 --> 22:56.040
Apophis would be disappointed in me if
there were an exception made for myself.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.600
What if I told you we were
bringing you to see Apophis personally?

22:59.760 --> 23:04.640
To show blood has been shed and your
quadrant is truly ready for his return?

23:06.400 --> 23:11.440
If we don't bring you back, he will know
you failed our challenge and never return.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.920
- Then I must go.
- Good.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.920
Tell him we will make him proud.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.640
I will.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.800
Need a medical team!

23:47.080 --> 23:49.000
What happened, Colonel?

23:49.160 --> 23:51.080
My lord?

23:51.400 --> 23:54.080
Actually,
we just call him General Hammond.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.320
Where is Apophis?

23:57.160 --> 23:59.800
- He's not here. I'm sorry.
- What have we got?

24:00.560 --> 24:02.480
Liars. Traitors!

24:03.200 --> 24:05.120
Easy! Easy!

24:05.280 --> 24:08.880
- You will be punished. He will avenge me!
- Who is this, sir?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.920
His name's Rogers.
Despite appearances, he's not SGC.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.520
He will strike you down! You will all die!

24:15.160 --> 24:17.240
Go! Let's get him to the infirmary!

24:20.280 --> 24:22.200
I'd like to debrief ASAP, Colonel.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.960
Yes, my lord.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.880
What's this final challenge all about?

24:32.760 --> 24:35.920
In my training, it is when
we received our actual staff weapons.

24:36.080 --> 24:39.200
The two camps then did battle
until one side emerged victorious.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.400
You killed each other?

24:42.000 --> 24:45.360
The Goa'uld wish only the strong
to prevail, Major Carter.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.440
I was among the victors.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.720
We were honoured by Apophis and I
became a member of his personal guard.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.920
And that's what's about to happen
to those boys?

24:55.080 --> 24:59.480
As long as they don't have real
weapons to play with, I don't see how.

25:00.200 --> 25:04.760
The only lethal weapons in the armoury
belonged to us. The rest were intars.

25:04.960 --> 25:08.640
The Jaffa who supervised their war
games have long ago abandoned them.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.840
Yet they have maintained their games
until this day without fail.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.040
- So what are you saying?
- That they're resourceful and determined.

25:16.200 --> 25:21.240
So they might try to fulfil the challenge
whether they have lethal weapons or not.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.120
It is possible.

25:23.280 --> 25:27.520
If they really want to kill each other
they don't need guns to do it.

25:27.680 --> 25:31.920
We have to go back there, sir,
and try and prevent this from happening.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.280
General, we're indirectly
responsible for this.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.160
They think that
we were sent through to start this.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.720
I understand.

25:40.880 --> 25:45.520
What we need to send back there is a
team of shrinks. Those kids are out there.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.280
Maybe so, Colonel, but before I send you
or anyone else into a battle zone,...

25:50.440 --> 25:53.280
..l wanna know
what's going on on that planet.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.960
Why don't I see
what I can get out of Rogers?

25:57.560 --> 25:59.480
Very well.

26:06.920 --> 26:10.280
He won't eat, he won't speak -
except to call me a shol'va.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.000
You must be doin' a good job.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.720
There's no internal injury.
He mustn't have taken the full blast.

26:16.880 --> 26:20.840
Physically he'll be fine.
Emotionally, that's another story.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.840
- He's very angry, Colonel.
- Where's his tray?

26:24.480 --> 26:26.400
Right here.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.400
Good luck.

26:45.320 --> 26:48.080
Ol' Doc Fraiser says
you haven't been eatin'.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.800
- It's poison.
- It's hospital food. Of course it is.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.520
Mmm...

26:59.720 --> 27:01.400
Tuna.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.280
Go to Sokar.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.760
It's "go to hell", actually.

27:09.600 --> 27:13.520
Which, by the way, is a rude thing to say
to a person offering you a sandwich.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.600
It means the same.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.880
You've got a point.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.200
I will reveal nothing.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.760
- You may begin torturing me.
- Oh, I've already begun.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.200
This is the infamous "tuna torture".

27:38.280 --> 27:40.200
Last chance.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.200
Good.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.680
So, you and I should have a little talk
about this final-challenge thing.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.440
We will battle to the death,...

28:02.600 --> 28:05.040
..and Apophis will choose
the victors as his guard.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.760
All right. I'm gonna tell you
the absolute truth right now.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.640
Apophis is dead.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.600
Gods cannot die!

28:16.560 --> 28:19.680
Why do you think
he's been gone for so long?

28:19.840 --> 28:22.320
Why have all the Jaffa masters left?

28:22.760 --> 28:25.320
Apophis was on his way out
when you got drafted.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.400
- You lie.
- What if he told you himself?

28:28.560 --> 28:31.880
If Apophis can speak,
then he cannot be dead.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.400
When Apophis came to us,
he had already been tortured.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.720
Impossible. He is a god.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.280
The images we are about to show
you are of Apophis just before he died...

28:51.440 --> 28:53.360
..and his body was sent to Sokar.

28:55.040 --> 28:58.360
- Gods cannot die.
- So you keep saying.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.480
Have a look.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.920
Help me.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.280
A host.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.800
I am...

29:21.080 --> 29:23.000
..afraid.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.240
(gasps)

29:48.520 --> 29:52.640
- What magic is this?
- No magic. I was there.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.760
As was l.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.640
Then it is true.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.600
It is.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.360
What will you do to us?

30:11.520 --> 30:14.600
We're not going to do anything to you.
We wanna help you.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.640
You can go home. Wherever that is.

30:21.440 --> 30:23.360
War's over.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.560
No, it's not.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.960
Because tomorrow
the final challenge begins.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.640
And many of my men will die.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.160
For him.

30:46.440 --> 30:50.640
- (Hammond) What's your real name, son?
- My true name is Rophiapgisy, sir.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.280
Your Earth name is Kyle.
Can we call you Kyle?

30:54.720 --> 30:56.800
That would be fine, sir.
I'm used to that.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.080
How long have you been on that planet?

30:59.240 --> 31:03.600
We were brought there five cycles ago
from a number of different worlds.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.120
Right after we blew up Apophis's ships.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.360
He commanded that
we worship no other god but him.

31:09.520 --> 31:13.000
He left many Jaffa warriors with us.
They taught us everything.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.360
Who taught you all about Earth?
Our uniforms, weapons?

31:16.520 --> 31:19.480
Near the beginning Apophis
captured one of your SG teams...

31:19.640 --> 31:22.200
- ..and forced them to teach us.
- SG-1 1 .

31:23.280 --> 31:25.680
Yes. At first that was
all they would reveal,...

31:25.840 --> 31:28.840
..but our Jaffa masters
forced them to say things.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.560
We listened to your speech, observed
your ways, but they did not last long.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.080
What happened to them?

31:36.560 --> 31:40.120
One day their bodies
were put on display in the encampment.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.360
I... I do not know how they died,...

31:43.360 --> 31:47.600
..only that they refused to tell the Jaffa
masters all that was asked of them.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.680
Then our Jaffa masters
began to leave us one by one.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.520
They said, to help Apophis
win a great battle.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.240
And then we were alone.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.480
Thank you for your cooperation, son.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.400
May I now ask for your cooperation, sir?

32:05.400 --> 32:06.440
Go on.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.640
As we speak, my men
are preparing for the final challenge.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.680
I was under the impression
your weapons are non-lethal.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.760
They are.

32:16.160 --> 32:20.920
But before Master Gar'toc left, he showed
Captain Nelson and myself a cave.

32:21.080 --> 32:25.920
Inside were weapons intended for
the final challenge. Real weapons.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.840
What are we talking about here?
Weapons-wise.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.800
They're exactly like your own. MP5s.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.920
He told us it was with those we would one
day infiltrate the Tauri and destroy him.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.080
May I request permission to be returned
to my men, sir?

32:50.240 --> 32:52.840
To tell them what I've learned
and to try and stop them?

32:53.000 --> 32:56.960
- They won't believe you. You know that.
- They are under my command.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.440
Teal'c, is the vo'cume
capable of recording other images?

33:00.600 --> 33:02.120
Yes, that is correct.

33:02.280 --> 33:06.000
Well, then, Colonel O'Neill's
already thought of the solution.

33:08.040 --> 33:11.800
- You know where I'm going with this, sir.
- Haven't a clue.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.200
Well, if seeing Apophis die
was enough to convince Kyle,...

33:15.360 --> 33:18.720
..all we have to do is show
that same image to everyone else.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.440
- With the vo'cume device?
- Yes.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.040
I believe O'Neill's solution
could be successful.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.600
In a battlefield? Combining
alien technology with our own?

33:27.760 --> 33:32.880
Sir, the technical part of transferring
the data to the vo'cume I can figure out.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.240
We've already been experimenting with
interfacing Goa'uld technology with ours.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.160
The problem will be getting there.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.880
We do have the intars, General.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.920
What good will they do?

33:46.080 --> 33:48.560
We can shoot first
and ask questions later.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.560
May I request permission
to join them, sir?

33:53.600 --> 33:55.480
They are his men, General.

33:55.640 --> 33:59.800
And he might provide the tactical
advantage we need to pull this off.

34:03.840 --> 34:06.680
Final-challenge scenario.
Let's hear it one more time.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.080
My elite SG squad
is to defend the encampment...

34:09.239 --> 34:13.040
..from an invading force of
other SG teams, led by Captain Nelson.

34:13.199 --> 34:16.639
The attackers have greater numbers,
the defenders, greater firepower.

34:16.800 --> 34:20.920
- But both sides will be in SG uniforms.
- As it would have been on Earth.

34:21.080 --> 34:25.719
All right, once we take the encampment
we become defenders to buy Carter time.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.960
Is everyone clear on that? Daniel?

34:28.760 --> 34:30.320
- What?
- Good.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.960
You, stay with Carter -
who will watch you like a hawk.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.199
- Yes, sir.
- SG-1, you have a go.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.560
(gunfire)

35:34.800 --> 35:37.120
- I said stay with Carter!
- I was drawing fire.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.560
You will listen to every word I tell you
and do everything I tell you,...

35:40.720 --> 35:43.320
..or I will shoot you myself. Is that clear?

35:44.480 --> 35:46.400
Damn it.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.520
Yes, sir.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.920
Status report, Sergeant!

36:49.680 --> 36:53.080
- Captain Rogers?!
- I am back with a message from Apophis.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.160
I have glorious news.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.560
- Get the vacuum.
- Vo'cume.

37:05.720 --> 37:08.960
Carter, set it up.
Teal'c with Carter, Daniel with me.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.560
- Here they come.
- I got some at nine o'clock here too.

37:46.880 --> 37:50.040
- It is ready.
- Good. I'm not. Give me a second.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.840
- Any time, Carter.
- Yes, sir!

37:54.000 --> 37:58.240
- What is the delay?
- You can't just combine the technologies.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.280
I have to match the frequency
of the vo'cume before I can transmit.

38:07.240 --> 38:08.760
O'Neill!

38:13.520 --> 38:14.840
Incoming!

38:17.600 --> 38:20.520
- Rogers! What the hell was that?
- Mortars!

38:20.680 --> 38:25.000
- What else is in that cave?
- Stingers, M60s, M72s, TOW missiles.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.560
We need this now!

38:26.720 --> 38:28.640
What the hell was... Get down!

38:33.480 --> 38:35.400
Damn it, Carter!

38:42.080 --> 38:44.000
Got it.

38:56.320 --> 38:59.040
Warriors of Apophis,
assemble before me...

38:59.200 --> 39:02.040
..and listen to he
that possesses the vo'cume.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.800
The warrior before you
speaks in my name. Heed his words.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.440
It's a message from Apophis himself!

39:39.800 --> 39:42.240
Summoning his image in battle
is against the rules!

39:42.400 --> 39:44.600
- Hear him!
- When the challenge is over!

39:44.760 --> 39:49.000
Now, Nelson! You will listen to him now!

39:51.000 --> 39:55.240
- Before anybody else gets hurt.
- The final challenge is to the death.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.480
A host.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.280
I am...

40:18.640 --> 40:20.560
..afraid.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.200
(gasps)

40:28.880 --> 40:30.800
He is a god.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.440
It cannot be so.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.600
It is so.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.880
What will become of us?

40:57.480 --> 40:59.400
Where will we go now?

41:00.400 --> 41:02.320
Home.

41:13.960 --> 41:16.200
