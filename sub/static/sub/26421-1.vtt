00:22.188 --> 00:23.308
Scoot over.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.192
Okay.

00:30.739 --> 00:31.739
All right.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.588
You ready?

00:49.799 --> 00:51.049
All right, wait...

00:53.636 --> 00:54.466
Okay.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.848
Just keep breathing, okay?

00:59.184 --> 01:00.564
-You breathing?
-Yes, just go!

01:00.643 --> 01:02.103
All right. One...

01:02.479 --> 01:03.309
two...

01:04.355 --> 01:05.435
-three. What?
-Fuck!

01:05.522 --> 01:07.983
-Oh, my God, Richard!
-Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.028
-It really fucking hurts.
-I'm sorry. Okay.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.238
-Oh, God!
-Almost done, almost done.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.372
Almost done.

01:16.868 --> 01:17.698
Done.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.917
I think you hit a nerve.

01:22.624 --> 01:26.004
I'm sorry, sweetheart. I did exactly
what the nurse told me to do.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.296
Wasn't it supposed be
more like right here?

01:28.379 --> 01:30.089
No, it's the upper-outer quadrant.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.673
Then why did it hurt like that?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.340
None of the message boards said
it was gonna hurt like that.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.427
I-I don't know, Rach.

01:36.137 --> 01:39.677
It's a bigger needle. Maybe you have
a lower pain threshold than most people.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.636
I don't know.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.771
I am not a doctor, remember?

01:49.651 --> 01:50.571
Are you mad at me?

01:54.322 --> 01:55.202
No.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.199
I'm not mad, I'm just...

01:58.201 --> 01:59.491
Whatever. I don't know.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.200
Tired.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.299
These are your consent forms.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.644
Both partners' signatures are required
on the second page.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.889
This is our policy regarding
embryo storage,

03:01.973 --> 03:03.563
these schedules on the back.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.141
You both need to initial each paragraph,

03:06.227 --> 03:08.397
-then sign here.
-Very good. Thank you.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.936
-And this is for you.
-Oh. This--

03:12.025 --> 03:13.605
-Instructions are inside.
-Good.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.945
-Ah, there you are.
-Hey! What's wrong?

03:16.237 --> 03:18.067
Nothing,
it's just fucking freezing in here.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.696
Just... relax. Don't obsess, all right?

03:20.783 --> 03:22.203
I'm not obsessing. I'm cold.

03:26.247 --> 03:29.287
Okay. You need to sign these.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.457
Oh, my God, what are we doing?

03:31.836 --> 03:35.716
-Are we really doing this? Are we insane?
-No, we're not insane. We're normal.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.472
This is not normal.
This is the opposite of normal.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.260
I'm not sure it's even ethical.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.807
-Remember what Marty said?
-Ugh.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.730
"Having a baby is an immoral act."

03:45.850 --> 03:46.810
Marty's an idiot.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.227
"Overpopulation, climate change...

03:49.896 --> 03:52.356
rise of neo-fascism."

03:53.483 --> 03:55.993
-Did you take your Valium?
-Yes, why?

03:58.154 --> 03:59.074
Ms. Biegler?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.161
-One sec. Okay.
-Okay.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.621
Okay, I guess we're really doing this.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.615
-Don't be scared, okay?
-Okay.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.424
You're gonna do great.
All we need is one good egg.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.746
Okay. You, too.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.458
Don't be scared, you're gonna do great.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.630
-Okay, I love you.
-I love you, too.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.390
Ah!

04:27.475 --> 04:31.685
Fuck! Oh, my God, your dick feels
so good inside of me!

04:32.188 --> 04:33.728
Ah... Ah!

04:34.232 --> 04:37.032
Ah, yeah, fuck me like a fucking whore!

04:37.151 --> 04:38.611
Fuck me like a whore!

04:38.736 --> 04:42.616
Yeah, I wanna feel the head of your cock
deep inside of me!

04:43.074 --> 04:44.374
Yeah, give it to me!

04:44.575 --> 04:45.405
Oh...

04:45.493 --> 04:48.163
Fuck! Oh, God!

04:48.371 --> 04:49.661
Yes! Yes!

04:50.039 --> 04:50.999
Oh...

04:51.082 --> 04:54.292
Fuck! Yes! God!

04:56.212 --> 04:58.842
Fuck, yeah!
I like it when you squeeze my ass!

04:59.882 --> 05:01.552
You like my fucking ass?

05:01.926 --> 05:02.756
Yeah!

05:03.594 --> 05:05.604
Tell me, how does that feel?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.637
Wanna fuck me like a little whore?

05:07.807 --> 05:08.847
Yes? Huh?

05:09.851 --> 05:12.691
My eight-year-old came to work one day
to see what I do.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.192
You know,
"Take Your Daughter To Work Day."

05:16.482 --> 05:17.362
Well...

05:17.984 --> 05:23.324
she said I had the most boring job
in the world.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.332
All I do all day...

05:26.993 --> 05:29.003
is put people to sleep.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.496
Excuse me, ma'am?

06:14.415 --> 06:15.245
Nurse?

06:17.835 --> 06:19.455
Where's my husband?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.295
Your birth partner never joined you?

06:22.632 --> 06:23.802
He's my husband.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.093
-Excuse me--
-My birth partner, he's my husband.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.467
Mr. Grim?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.470
Grimes. Yes, Richard Grimes.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.347
You're gonna need to speak
to a doctor. Let me go find someone.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.733
-Is something wrong?
-Just a moment.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.346
Why can't you just tell me?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.226
Hello?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.438
Fuck!

06:43.486 --> 06:44.946
There wasn't any sperm.

06:47.698 --> 06:48.698
Excuse me?

06:49.534 --> 06:51.374
Your husband didn't have any sperm.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.541
Wait, you mean he couldn't...

06:58.751 --> 06:59.591
do it?

07:00.628 --> 07:04.718
No, he produced,
and there was semen, but no sperm.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.681
Dr. Dordick will have to give you
the details.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.435
Think of it like a soda machine.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.992
Either one of you ever work
in a movie theater?

07:25.069 --> 07:27.819
So, the seltzer comes from one place,

07:27.905 --> 07:30.445
the syrup comes from someplace else,

07:30.533 --> 07:34.623
and, together, they make Mountain Dew,
or Diet Coke, or what have you.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.964
But, if the pipe gets clogged,

07:39.250 --> 07:40.630
you don't get Mountain Dew.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.003
You just get seltzer.

07:42.670 --> 07:45.130
Richard is probably blocked.

07:45.923 --> 07:48.183
Like mentally? Like psychosomatic?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.848
No, not mentally. Physically.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.390
-Like the talk about the soda machine.
-Right, sorry.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.933
Yeah. So, I just got off the phone
with a buddy of mine.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.097
He's a urologist, he's an expert on this.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.806
In fact, he's writing a book about it.
Joel Fisher.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.438
Oh, my God. That is so depressing.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.939
It's not depressing, Rich.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.817
Based on everything we've talked about,

08:07.904 --> 08:11.244
he's convinced you've got sperm in there.
The trick is we gotta get it out.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.334
-Okay.
-Now, there's a procedure for this,

08:13.409 --> 08:15.539
and Joel's definitely the man for the job.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.250
It's called TESE.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.832
Testicular Sperm Extraction.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.340
Oh, my God.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.668
Not as bad as it sounds.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.336
You know he only has one testicle, right?

08:27.089 --> 08:27.919
What?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.586
He needs to know.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.761
Yeah, I realize that.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.101
I only have one testicle.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.181
-Yeah, I saw the note in your file.
-Okay.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.476
I filled Fisher in.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.774
He doesn't anticipate it being a problem.

08:40.895 --> 08:44.975
What he'll do is avoid the vas,
and go right to the source,

08:45.066 --> 08:46.776
doing a testicular biopsy.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.606
-Like for cancer?
-No, Rach, not cancer.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.565
I don't have cancer. I have blocked sperm.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.026
Sorry, he said biopsy.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.204
The thing is, if we do TESE,

08:56.285 --> 08:59.245
then we're gonna have to do ICSI.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.422
It's Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.040
It's an additional expense,
but that actually can't be helped.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.167
The good news is Fisher is available.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.052
Happens to be in the city today.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.388
Bad news is he'll need a check
for $10,000.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.390
I know, it's... short notice.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.555
-Not a problem.
-Ah.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.308
-It's not?
-No.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.558
Okay, well, take a minute.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.983
Talk things over.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.316
When you're ready,
I will give Fisher a call.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.780
Meanwhile, Moira can get you suited up,

09:30.278 --> 09:33.278
and we're off to the races. Yeah, boom!

09:34.240 --> 09:35.200
Okay.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.957
Richard, we don't have $10,000.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.619
I know. I'm gonna call Charlie.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.791
I thought we weren't gonna tell anybody.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.253
I know, but what are we
supposed to do, Rach?

09:48.337 --> 09:51.047
-My God.
-Eleven of your eggs are sitting in here

09:51.132 --> 09:53.682
and we don't have anything
to inseminate them with.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.013
So if I don't call him, we're screwed.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.850
The cycle will have been a bust,

09:57.972 --> 10:01.182
and we will have blown through a big chunk
of our baby budget for nothing.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.702
That's great, no, that's fine, it's no...

10:14.780 --> 10:18.740
If you're gonna be here within the...
Yeah, okay, good. All right.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.868
I'll see you soon. Bye.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.165
-He's on his way with a check.
-He is?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.672
-Yep!
-Did Cynthia say anything?

10:26.917 --> 10:28.417
What? No, of course not.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.092
-She's so judgmental.
-No, she's not.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.971
Yes, she is.
She was even weird when we were doing IUI.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.974
-They're doing it again?
-No, this is something totally different.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.267
New doctor, very high-tech. It's got...

10:42.767 --> 10:45.897
egg harvesting, hatching...
something called "icksy."

10:47.897 --> 10:49.147
You seen my pants?

10:49.273 --> 10:51.863
I thought they were done with that
and were trying to adopt.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.242
They're still doing that.
But after that thing with that girl,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.450
they're trying
a by-any-means-necessary approach,

10:56.530 --> 10:58.450
-doing both at once.
-Oh, my God.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.992
They're like impulsive gamblers.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.696
Anyway, it's very technical
and it's hard to keep track of,

11:02.787 --> 11:06.037
but there's a problem with Richard's sperm
and he needs to borrow $10,000,

11:06.123 --> 11:07.083
like, now.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.418
You're not gonna give it to him?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.421
-Oh, yeah.
-What?

11:09.710 --> 11:11.000
-Charlie!
-They'll pay me back.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.087
Giving them money is just enabling them!

11:13.172 --> 11:17.682
-To do what?
-To pursue this fantasy of fertility,

11:17.760 --> 11:19.890
when it's pretty clear
that it's consuming them.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.600
They are strung out.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.184
Their marriage is a wreck,
they're always fighting.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.981
They're like fertility junkies!

11:27.478 --> 11:28.398
That's nuts.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.939
Oh, come on.
They've been doing this for years!

11:31.023 --> 11:33.033
They need to stop. They need to move on.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.319
Mom! Sadie's on the phone.
She doesn't sound good.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.784
-My goodness! Hi, honey.
-I really need to get going.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.616
Yeah-- I really want you to think about
what you're doing!

11:41.701 --> 11:43.541
Mom, what's going on?

11:43.619 --> 11:46.119
Nothing. It's just,
Charlie is going into the city--

11:46.205 --> 11:48.955
I'm gonna pick up some stuff
at Russ &amp; Daughters. You want salmon?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.041
Hey, Charlotte, do you want salmon?

11:51.168 --> 11:51.998
What?

11:52.378 --> 11:56.008
Do you-- Dad is going into Manhattan.
You want Russ &amp; Daughters?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.182
Bialy and an everything bagel.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.009
Bialy and an everything bagel,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.934
and get me a half a pound of wild--

12:02.012 --> 12:04.772
No! Get me a half... quarter pound
of wild nova!

12:05.725 --> 12:07.845
Hi, honey. So sorry about that.
Is everything okay?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.772
Not really.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.271
What's wrong?

12:13.649 --> 12:14.819
Are you smoking?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.645
No, I quit. I told you.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.912
I'm just-- I've got a cold and it's--

12:21.157 --> 12:22.947
I'm standing outside and it's freezing.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.541
You sound funny.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.745
I'm not doing well.

12:28.998 --> 12:29.998
Are you failing?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.841
No, not-- God, Mom. Not--

12:33.085 --> 12:36.795
Emotionally, not academically.
God, you're so achievement-oriented.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.007
Finishing college at 25 isn't exactly
an achievement, Sadie.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.512
It's damage control.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.507
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.476
-It's what you think.
-No, it's not what I think.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.349
I just want you to find something
that you love doing,

12:51.437 --> 12:54.227
that will, you know,
give your life meaning and purpose.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.145
I found it.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.281
Remember?

12:57.985 --> 12:58.855
Writing?

12:59.528 --> 13:01.318
Right. Yes.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.779
And you're so good at it,

13:02.865 --> 13:06.695
but if you want to be a writer writer,
like professional,

13:06.786 --> 13:08.696
you have to be driven and disciplined.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.291
If you're having trouble with that now,
imagine how hard it's gonna be

13:11.373 --> 13:13.383
in real life when you have
to pay rent at the same time.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.749
I'm not failing, Mom! I did good work
at the beginning of this semester

13:16.837 --> 13:19.337
that I'm really proud of. I'm just...

13:20.341 --> 13:22.301
I'm stuck right now,

13:22.384 --> 13:25.394
and I'm not gonna be ready to hand in
my portfolio in writing workshop,

13:25.471 --> 13:28.431
which is like 80 per cent of my grade,
but I've got this great professor

13:28.516 --> 13:30.806
who really believes in me,
and the good news is

13:30.893 --> 13:34.653
she's gonna give me an "incomplete,"
which is really great, because...

13:36.941 --> 13:37.781
Sadie?

13:39.026 --> 13:41.566
I'm just waiting for you to tell me
that in the real world,

13:41.654 --> 13:43.454
there's no such thing as an "incomplete."

13:46.158 --> 13:48.948
Honey, why don't you come home
and we can talk about this in person?

13:50.079 --> 13:52.579
-I can't come home, Mom.
-Why not?

13:55.042 --> 13:58.252
Because... I wanna be in the city.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.511
Oh, my God, Sadie.
How are you gonna do that?

14:01.590 --> 14:05.010
I'll work, I'll waitress. It's not gonna
cost you a penny, I promise.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.514
Uncle Richard and Aunt Rachel said I could
stay at their place anytime--

14:08.597 --> 14:10.427
Richard and Rachel have a lot
on their plate.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.346
They're not in any position to take care
of anyone but themselves right now.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.589
Say goodnight to everyone.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.420
Say goodnight!

15:24.506 --> 15:26.256
-Goodnight!
-Goodnight!

15:26.342 --> 15:29.052
On Monday and Thursday,
they clean the north side of the street.

15:29.136 --> 15:32.306
On Tuesday and Friday,
they clean the south side of the street.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.889
On the weekends, they don't do anything.
I don't see what the problem is

15:35.976 --> 15:38.766
about alternate-side parking.
I mean, people get so, like,

15:38.854 --> 15:40.444
"What are you gonna do with the car?"

15:40.522 --> 15:44.072
It's all just party people drinking
themselves sick on the weekends.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.191
-For real?
-Yes.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.906
I can barely walk the dogs at night.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.243
Oh, man.

15:50.741 --> 15:54.501
I just don't wanna find myself at 50
in some block association meeting

15:54.578 --> 15:56.618
trying to prevent the opening
of a new bar.

15:56.705 --> 15:57.785
Richard...

15:58.165 --> 16:00.165
we're not turning 50 on East 6th Street.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.464
I'm 47.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.884
When's your book coming out?

16:07.841 --> 16:10.471
-April.
-Oh, that's exciting!

16:11.637 --> 16:14.097
I haven't written jack-shit
since Talia was born.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.392
Okay, you've got to try this,
I'm obsessed.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.846
-I drank it all summer.
-Oh... No, thank you.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.107
Really? It's Prosecco.
Not a Prosecco person?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.151
No, I am, I love it. I just...

16:27.194 --> 16:28.204
I can't.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.202
I'm cycling.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.954
Oh, my God, SoulCycle?

16:32.282 --> 16:35.952
My sister does that and her ass is like
two little coconuts. Do you love it?

16:37.079 --> 16:39.369
Yeah, no,
not that kind of cycling. It's...

16:41.583 --> 16:42.423
IVF.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.297
Oh, my God.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.298
-I'm so sorry. What an idiot!
-No!

16:50.384 --> 16:52.304
Why would-- That's okay.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.006
No, it's not! I'm such a dope.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.600
Wow!

16:57.349 --> 17:01.439
I didn't know you two were back to that.
I thought you were just trying to adopt.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.652
No, yeah, we are. We just figured
while we're waiting we might as well

17:05.733 --> 17:06.693
give this a shot.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.031
Ha!

17:08.359 --> 17:09.530
Sorry, that's a good one.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.161
Giving IVF "a shot."

17:13.949 --> 17:17.949
It's our first time. We've done a lot of
IUIs before, but we've never really...

17:18.203 --> 17:19.623
brought out the big guns.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.285
I'm sure it'll really increase
your chances though, right?

17:24.042 --> 17:25.502
Yeah, I don't know...

17:27.087 --> 17:28.627
Our numbers aren't that great.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.343
You should talk to my cousin, Erin.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.507
-Yeah?
-She did IVF to get her kids.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.474
The doctors told her she shouldn't bother.
Her chances were one percent or something.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.926
And she got pregnant twice.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.186
In her 40s. With only one ovary.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.401
Wow.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.069
I'm sure she'd be happy to talk to you
about it. And her kids...

17:46.565 --> 17:49.025
are amazing. Look at them.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.613
-Oh...
-How cute!

17:51.236 --> 17:52.066
Right?

17:56.658 --> 17:58.538
That's a double-A embryo right there.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.584
See the tightly-packed cells?

18:01.246 --> 18:02.616
That puppy's raring to go.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.918
I'm gonna transfer both,
but I'm putting my money on that guy.

18:07.920 --> 18:08.840
You ready?

18:10.881 --> 18:11.761
All righty...

18:12.257 --> 18:13.877
Here we go, guys! Showtime!

18:15.344 --> 18:18.684
Now your job is just to relax
and breathe, okay?

18:19.765 --> 18:21.175
This might be a little cold.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.227
Just... relax.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.691
That's it.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.612
You like prog rock?

18:36.365 --> 18:37.195
No.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.104
All right. Let's get pregnant, shall we?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.659
Oh, here. Let's grab that one.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.080
Oh, my God! Wait! Richard! Get it!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.410
-Oh!
-Richard!

19:22.494 --> 19:24.414
-Ho, ho, ho!
-Jesus Christ!

19:40.345 --> 19:42.845
Excuse me, excuse me. Hi!

19:42.931 --> 19:44.561
-Could you open your--
-It's fine, sweetheart.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.481
No, it's not. I'm trying to implant.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.863
Sir, could you please open up your thing?
Could you open that up?

19:50.105 --> 19:51.055
Hi!

19:51.273 --> 19:54.323
Hi, I just had a medical procedure--

19:56.153 --> 19:57.533
It's gynecological.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.617
If you could just slow down and go easy
on the bumps, I'd really appreciate it.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.501
-How we doing?
-Good!

20:11.293 --> 20:12.213
Okay.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.216
As of now...

20:18.258 --> 20:21.178
-there are no IVF materials in sight.
-Great.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.760
Ugh...

20:23.972 --> 20:27.312
Hey, you think we should
take down the Lisa Yuskavage?

20:28.435 --> 20:30.095
What? No!

20:30.270 --> 20:32.360
I'm just looking at it
from Beth's perspective.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.149
We're used to it, but...

20:34.316 --> 20:36.146
if we sit next to each other on the couch

20:36.235 --> 20:38.855
and Beth sits across from us,
it's right in her face.

20:38.946 --> 20:39.986
What is?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.279
The vagina.

20:43.283 --> 20:46.453
I think we should at least move it
so it's not so...

20:47.412 --> 20:48.372
central.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.882
No. No.

20:52.459 --> 20:56.459
If our social worker's so uptight that she
would deny us a child because we have...

20:57.130 --> 20:59.880
a vagina on our wall,
well, then it's, like...

21:00.175 --> 21:01.505
screw everything!

21:02.970 --> 21:03.800
No!

21:04.221 --> 21:08.021
I mean, you know, it's, like, fuck it!
Just fuck the whole fucking thing!

21:08.100 --> 21:09.770
-Okay.
-So sick of people judging us,

21:09.851 --> 21:11.481
telling us what to do all the time.

21:11.561 --> 21:14.401
Between the doctors, the social workers,
and the support groups,

21:14.523 --> 21:16.403
it's like, you know what,
shut the fuck up already!

21:16.483 --> 21:18.153
Shove it up your fucking asses!

21:21.947 --> 21:24.567
So, before Kyra went on maternity leave,

21:24.658 --> 21:27.238
she walked me through everything,
so I'm pretty up to date.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.827
-Okay.
-But...

21:29.288 --> 21:31.918
there's really nothing that can replace
the face-to-face.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.209
-Yes.
-Oops. Hope it's not too hot.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.133
Thank you.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.960
-You want any?
-No, I'm good.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.256
Yeah, she's a good friend of ours.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.762
Not the woman in the picture,
the artist who made it.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.218
She's a friend.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.478
-It was a wedding present.
-Yeah, so...

21:53.103 --> 21:57.773
So, it looks like you came to adoption
after some fertility treatments.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.686
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.119
Well, it wasn't for us.
Just didn't feel right.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.788
Plus, Richard only has one testicle, so...

22:13.040 --> 22:16.170
And I see that you were matched
with a birth mother last winter.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.248
Would you mind telling me
a little bit about that?

22:21.381 --> 22:22.221
Yeah.

22:23.508 --> 22:24.628
Okay...

22:28.847 --> 22:31.977
Well, we had been officially waiting
for a couple of months,

22:32.059 --> 22:33.769
and we weren't getting any calls,

22:33.852 --> 22:35.772
-which was totally depressing.
-Yeah.

22:35.979 --> 22:39.819
-Kyra told us about Parent Portraits...
-Yeah.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.435
...and so we decided to give it a try.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.568
About a week after our page went up,

22:45.655 --> 22:46.735
-we got a call.
-Yeah.

22:50.911 --> 22:51.831
Fuck!

22:52.913 --> 22:53.793
Hello?

22:55.791 --> 22:57.831
Yes, hi. Yeah, that's us.

22:59.169 --> 23:02.169
No, we're so happy that you called.
It's the perfect time.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.513
Yes, that's right. New York City. NYC.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.005
Well, it's got pros and cons,
but we love it.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.310
So where are you from?

23:14.226 --> 23:15.976
Wow. Really?

23:17.354 --> 23:19.154
Birthplace of Bill Clinton.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.533
No, we've never been there,
but that's somewhere we've always...

23:24.611 --> 23:25.861
we've always wanted to go to.

23:26.279 --> 23:29.409
No, we were just watching TV.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.453
Yes, exactly, the city that never sleeps.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.536
We talked almost every night for a month.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.711
"He's so weird, so scrawny,"
and he was like--

23:37.582 --> 23:41.422
Yeah, he like asked me out
for ice cream or something.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.423
I don't know, whatever you do in 6th Grade
and I was like, "No..."

23:44.506 --> 23:46.876
I guess it was, yeah,
freshman year of high school.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.761
He asked me out again. He was relentless.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.934
We just fell in love with her.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.064
What's the story with that thing?

23:59.813 --> 24:02.653
She was so young, it was almost like
we were her parents.

24:02.899 --> 24:03.729
No?

24:03.817 --> 24:06.697
-The doctor's appointment went so well!
-Okay!

24:06.778 --> 24:09.698
The only thing I did before
I got on, was...

24:10.740 --> 24:11.780
Oh!

24:11.867 --> 24:13.987
-Oh, that is so sweet!
-Very nice!

24:14.077 --> 24:16.577
They said that the heartbeat is great.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.253
The blood work...

24:18.874 --> 24:24.094
um, they did the whole sonogram thing,
and I guess it's growing at the right...

24:24.421 --> 24:25.711
speed, so--

24:38.935 --> 24:41.145
-And so you arranged to meet with her?
-Yeah.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.149
-Okay.
-Yup.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.978
Two days before Christmas.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.613
It's amazing we could get tickets.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.742
Yep. There she blows.

25:08.298 --> 25:13.798
-Okay! We got barbecue ribs and iced tea.
-Wow! That looks great, thank you.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.931
Are you sure there's nothing else
I can get for you?

25:17.057 --> 25:18.177
No. Thank you.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.726
-All right. Enjoy.
-Thank you.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.453
Rach, relax.

25:32.822 --> 25:33.702
She's just late.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.325
Come on. Have some mashed potatoes.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.176
After that it was just like...

25:55.136 --> 25:55.966
poof.

25:59.057 --> 25:59.927
She never...

26:00.475 --> 26:03.095
showed up and we never heard
from her again.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.494
We'd been warned about this stuff.

26:16.491 --> 26:19.201
But, it's not like she asked us for money
or anything.

26:31.631 --> 26:32.881
And when we got home,

26:33.174 --> 26:37.644
we realized that there was no name or date
on any of the sonograms.

26:42.058 --> 26:45.308
Kyra said that sometimes
the girls just want the attention.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.231
And there isn't a baby at all.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.320
We still don't know if she was...

26:55.822 --> 26:56.822
real or not.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.251
You know, it's much easier
when it involves money.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.875
At least that makes some kind of sense.

27:09.878 --> 27:12.088
But the emotional scams are just really...

27:13.214 --> 27:14.054
really tough.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.973
I mean, most people that've been through
what you've been through,

27:20.055 --> 27:21.215
they would've given up.

27:21.681 --> 27:25.141
Or they would have thrown themselves
right back on the fertility treadmill.

27:26.811 --> 27:30.361
It really is a testament
to your strength as a couple

27:30.774 --> 27:32.034
that you stuck with it

27:32.651 --> 27:34.651
and renewed your commitment to adoption.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.570
Thank you.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.432
Hey, Eno! Lazlo!

28:22.867 --> 28:23.737
Rich?

28:24.494 --> 28:25.834
A text from Rachel.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.496
What does it say?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.134
It's kind of personal.

28:39.676 --> 28:40.506
Thanks.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.310
We're rooting for you.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.334
Rach?

30:06.888 --> 30:07.808
Yeah, hello?

30:10.475 --> 30:14.345
Yes. Sure, just hold on just a second.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.653
Rach!

30:18.691 --> 30:20.031
Hey. It's Dordick.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.007
You could give it another go.

30:42.173 --> 30:45.093
This was your first IVF,
Rachel responded well.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.012
All it takes is one good egg.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.216
On the other hand...

30:51.307 --> 30:54.477
the two of you have been at it
for quite some time,

30:54.561 --> 30:56.941
and if money is a factor...

30:57.856 --> 31:00.816
that, combined with Rachel's age,
makes me think...

31:01.442 --> 31:07.162
sure, you could try again, but your best
chance for success is with a donor egg.

31:10.451 --> 31:11.951
Yeah. It's a big leap, I know.

31:12.495 --> 31:14.075
It takes some getting used to.

31:14.664 --> 31:18.084
And I don't want to diminish
the loss of a genetic link for Rachel.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.752
But there are a lot of positives
to consider.

31:22.505 --> 31:26.125
Rachel would carry the child,
she'd control the prenatal environment,

31:27.510 --> 31:28.550
give birth.

31:29.053 --> 31:29.933
Breastfeed.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.925
And, of course, there'd be
Richard's genetic contribution.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.517
It's a lot to wrap your head around.

31:40.857 --> 31:41.767
Give it some time.

31:43.401 --> 31:46.491
Meanwhile, take a look at our program,

31:46.571 --> 31:49.281
see what you think,
and we can talk next week.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.746
Well, he's out of his fucking mind.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.706
No way in hell I'm doing that.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.247
We should at least just think about it.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.295
I'm not saying that we would do it.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.216
We can just explore the idea,
see how we feel.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.894
Make a list of all the pros and cons.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.519
We talked about this.
We swore we would never do it.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.231
No, you swore that you would
never do it. I...

32:20.813 --> 32:24.403
I kept my mouth shut because I didn't want
to pressure you into something

32:24.484 --> 32:26.994
that you were gonna have to live with
for the rest of your life.

32:28.655 --> 32:32.325
Wait, so all this time I'm assuming
that we feel the same way about this,

32:32.408 --> 32:35.368
you've been having secret fantasies
about egg donation?

32:35.453 --> 32:36.873
It's not a secret fantasy.

32:37.121 --> 32:40.461
It is to me. I didn't know about it.
I thought that we had decided,

32:40.541 --> 32:42.001
together as a couple,

32:42.085 --> 32:44.295
that we would definitely
draw the line at...

32:44.504 --> 32:45.844
science fiction!

32:45.922 --> 32:47.722
It's not science fiction, Rach.

32:47.799 --> 32:51.509
It's pretty primitive, actually.
They do it with farm animals all the time.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.425
Well, I'm not a goat!

32:53.638 --> 32:55.678
-Okay?
-Bad example. I'm sorry.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.269
Oh, my God!

32:57.350 --> 33:00.690
You're, like, so gung-ho right now,
it's freaking me out.

33:00.770 --> 33:03.690
I am not gung-ho, I am just pragmatic.

33:03.773 --> 33:08.533
If we do another IVF with your eggs, we've
got a four per cent chance of pregnancy?

33:09.070 --> 33:12.660
With a donor egg, we'd be going
from four to, like, 65 per cent!

33:13.116 --> 33:16.116
The gambler in me just wants to put
my money on the better odds.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.327
Oh, my God!

33:18.287 --> 33:19.497
You're Guy Woodhouse.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.495
What?

33:21.582 --> 33:24.592
The husband in Rosemary's Baby,
John Cassavetes, that's you.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.999
Yeah, Rach. That's me,

33:26.087 --> 33:28.797
standing by while you're raped
by a satanic demon.

33:28.881 --> 33:33.141
I am just suggesting that we listen to
our doctor and look into all the options.

33:33.219 --> 33:35.679
We're already signed up for adoption.
What is the big deal?

33:35.763 --> 33:38.983
Well, for one, I'm not putting
someone else's body parts

33:39.058 --> 33:39.978
into my uterus.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.599
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me. Sorry.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.939
I know it's more complicated for you.

33:47.025 --> 33:51.395
-Isn't it more complicated for you, too?
-Yes, of course it is. Yes, yes.

33:53.072 --> 33:54.242
But you heard him.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.121
There's a lot of positives.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.786
-You would get to carry the baby.
-Whoop-de-doo!

33:59.203 --> 34:01.043
What does that make me, the bellhop?

34:03.291 --> 34:04.131
No.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.297
Why don't you just go screw
a younger woman, then?

34:09.380 --> 34:11.969
-What are you talking about?
-Look!

34:12.382 --> 34:14.053
There's one now. Go fuck her!

34:14.135 --> 34:16.635
I don't want to fuck her!

34:16.763 --> 34:19.563
My God, look, we are doing
everything we can,

34:19.639 --> 34:22.980
short of kidnapping, to start a family.
I do not know why

34:23.518 --> 34:24.649
this is so off-limits.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.228
That's easy for you to say.
You'll have your...

34:27.732 --> 34:29.862
genetic contribution, and me, I'm just...

34:31.235 --> 34:32.195
I'll just be...

34:35.197 --> 34:36.027
What?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.251
Left out.

34:46.708 --> 34:47.748
Don't even--

34:49.754 --> 34:50.634
Just don't.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.389
Oh...

35:49.897 --> 35:51.187
Who is it?

35:53.067 --> 35:56.067
It's the kids from the third floor.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.568
What do they want?

35:59.615 --> 36:00.575
Candy.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.117
It's Halloween.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.249
Shit.

36:06.455 --> 36:07.915
Just don't answer it.

36:14.922 --> 36:16.922
Someone's there. I heard them.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.142
But they're not answering.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.889
-But it's a holiday.
-It's not that kind of holiday.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.724
Not everybody celebrates Halloween.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.692
They did it last year.

36:32.106 --> 36:34.106
-Trick or Treat!
-Trick or Treat!

36:57.506 --> 36:59.876
Jesus, it's like eBay for ova.

37:03.471 --> 37:07.601
There's one that got
a full athletic scholarship in golf.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.938
I mean, have you ever even heard of that?
College golf?

37:12.313 --> 37:14.403
I thought you were working on your edit.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.284
So what do you think?

37:20.863 --> 37:22.623
-What?
-For her to have your baby.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.041
She's not having my baby. You are.

37:27.536 --> 37:30.246
Okay, fine. Well, just, what do you think?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.384
I think she's fine.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.459
-That's all you're gonna say?
-I'm not making a big thing out of this.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.295
It's just an egg.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.716
It's one cell.

37:42.134 --> 37:45.934
One cell that would contain half
the chromosomes of our child-to-be.

37:46.013 --> 37:49.273
-I don't see it that way.
-You are so in denial. It's crazy.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.940
You know what? Don't knock denial.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.192
It comes in very handy,
you should try it sometime.

37:54.355 --> 37:56.515
'Cause without it,
you end up like this guy.

38:00.695 --> 38:01.945
Listen to this.

38:02.488 --> 38:05.528
Double major,
Philosophy and Political Science,

38:05.658 --> 38:09.288
at an East Coast Ivy League university.
Entered at age 16.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.291
Too intimidating.

38:11.580 --> 38:15.000
Yeah. Your sperm might be
a little shy around her eggs.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.757
Favorite book, The Fountainhead?

38:20.756 --> 38:23.626
See, she's got an asterisk.
That means she's reserved.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.721
She probably has a waiting list.
It's that Ivy League thing.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.265
Hm. Hm. Whoa, whoa.

38:32.852 --> 38:33.732
Click on her.

38:34.729 --> 38:35.559
She's cute.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.492
She's got a BA in Journalism
and Cinema Studies.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.946
No wonder she's selling her eggs.
She can't get a job.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.043
I like her nose.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.922
I like your nose.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.842
This is actually kinda kinky, isn't it?

39:06.302 --> 39:07.642
I find it kind of...

39:08.554 --> 39:09.684
kind of kinky.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.055
Hm?

39:13.434 --> 39:14.394
Oh, my God.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.401
Richard.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.240
Wait. Is that...

39:25.363 --> 39:27.373
Er... Fiona from Mogador?

39:32.078 --> 39:32.908
Whoa.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.465
This is weird.

39:45.633 --> 39:49.303
Just think of it as an exercise.
There's no right or wrong answers.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.138
-All right.
-Okay?

39:51.222 --> 39:52.142
Yeah. All right.

39:54.141 --> 39:55.021
Fine.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.608
Well, you know, she's beautiful.
That's obvious.

40:02.316 --> 40:05.146
She's always nice, which is good,
whenever we come in.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.316
No matter how crowded.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.543
She's got a great laugh.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.622
Amazing body.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.831
In summer, when she wears those...

40:19.208 --> 40:22.378
thin cotton dresses,
with her hair all piled up--

40:22.461 --> 40:23.841
Oh, my God.

40:24.630 --> 40:25.460
What?

40:28.384 --> 40:30.144
You said there were no wrong answers.

40:30.219 --> 40:33.219
It's very confusing.
I've never done this before.

40:33.305 --> 40:36.975
Neither have I, but just...
stop thinking about fucking her.

40:37.143 --> 40:37.983
Okay?

40:39.019 --> 40:41.519
Think about her like she's your daughter,
not your...

40:42.648 --> 40:43.478
girlfriend.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.395
You wanted to do this, you know.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.990
You think I enjoy this?

40:49.363 --> 40:52.453
Looking for another woman's egg
to mix with my husband's sperm

40:52.533 --> 40:55.453
so we can shove it up my pussy
so we can make a baby?

40:56.871 --> 40:57.711
God!

40:58.456 --> 41:00.166
At least Fiona's an actual, real,

41:00.249 --> 41:02.919
flesh-and-blood person,
and not some random thumbnail photo.

41:03.002 --> 41:05.552
-I think maybe we should just ask her--
-What are you, crazy?

41:05.629 --> 41:09.049
-Jesus Christ!
-Jesus... Rach, are you crazy?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.683
We can't just ask her.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.845
-She put her picture up on the website.
-That doesn't mean that--

41:16.348 --> 41:17.428
Hey, guys.

41:20.561 --> 41:21.731
What can I get you?

41:24.231 --> 41:25.401
My God!

41:26.192 --> 41:28.112
It's like The Handmaid's Tale.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.783
It would be different if I had, like,

41:31.155 --> 41:34.025
a younger sister or something,
or like a cousin.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.157
Even like a family friend.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.787
Someone we had a real connection with,
so I wasn't just...

41:40.873 --> 41:44.003
preying on the bodies
of random young women.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.304
What?

42:08.400 --> 42:10.400
Really sucks, what you're going through.

42:11.403 --> 42:12.913
Yeah, it does, thanks.

42:14.782 --> 42:15.622
Thanks?

42:17.034 --> 42:19.414
For confirming
that my life sucks right now.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.705
-Okay.
-It really means a lot to me.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.039
Well, you're welcome.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.594
I know technically you're just
my step-uncle and aunt,

42:27.670 --> 42:30.510
but I feel closer to you guys
than everyone else in the family.

42:31.882 --> 42:32.932
You guys get it.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.642
Everyone else is on me all the time
to get my shit together

42:35.719 --> 42:37.719
like I'm some sort of dropout
or something.

42:39.265 --> 42:42.175
You did just drop out of Bard, didn't you?

42:43.018 --> 42:45.558
No, I was given permission
by the dean's office

42:45.646 --> 42:47.896
to finish my degree requirements
in absentia.

42:48.566 --> 42:49.396
Ah!

42:49.984 --> 42:52.954
-That's a thing.
-Yeah. I mean, that's Latin, right?

42:53.153 --> 42:54.113
For "dropped out."

42:54.363 --> 42:58.163
-Shut up!
-Ho! Ho! Careful, I'm driving here.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.872
Oh, my God! Even you, Uncle Cool.

43:00.953 --> 43:03.793
You know what? You came up with
that nickname, not me.

43:04.790 --> 43:08.130
And the fact that anyone would refer to me
as cool

43:08.294 --> 43:11.634
is just evidence of how utterly uncool
our family actually is.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.092
-That's true.
-Yeah.

43:45.080 --> 43:47.580
Thought everything was supposed to be
all gentrified now.

43:50.628 --> 43:54.008
Well, I guess they forgot about
our corner.

43:58.093 --> 43:59.603
It's so Serpico.

44:02.931 --> 44:03.891
There you go.

44:05.601 --> 44:06.441
Hey!

44:06.935 --> 44:09.555
Oh, my God! Hi, puppies!

44:09.772 --> 44:11.072
Hi, Sade!

44:12.650 --> 44:13.690
Hi!

44:14.193 --> 44:15.363
Oh, my God!

44:15.444 --> 44:16.784
Whoa, whoa!

44:18.822 --> 44:20.162
God, you guys all right?

44:23.661 --> 44:26.081
So, how do you plan on finishing?

44:26.580 --> 44:27.410
Online.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.167
Really?

44:29.625 --> 44:30.495
Why online?

44:31.502 --> 44:34.382
Because that way, I don't have to talk
to deluded college students

44:34.463 --> 44:37.173
who think the world gives a shit
about their stupid short fiction,

44:37.257 --> 44:39.127
which isn't even fiction
in the first place,

44:39.218 --> 44:42.848
just thinly-veiled autobiographical crap
about their entitled upbringing.

44:43.472 --> 44:46.062
Wow. Thank you.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.642
And I won't have to listen
to what a big deal it is

44:48.727 --> 44:52.557
that they're being published in some
literary magazine no one has heard of,

44:52.648 --> 44:54.148
like Tin House or whatever.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.323
Wait, Tin House?

44:58.779 --> 45:01.659
Tin House is a really well-regarded
literary magazine.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.570
Yeah.

45:02.658 --> 45:05.658
-They published something of yours, right?
-Yeah, once.

45:06.453 --> 45:09.713
So everybody at your school's
getting published in Tin House?

45:10.249 --> 45:11.379
Not everybody.

45:11.542 --> 45:14.962
I just mean in general, like,
everyone is so self-promoting,

45:15.087 --> 45:17.507
and convinced of their artistic promise,
and I'm like,

45:17.589 --> 45:19.799
"Hey, my uncle is an award-winning
theater genius,

45:19.883 --> 45:22.853
and my aunt is a real-life playwright
and author who gets...

45:23.345 --> 45:27.925
invited to Yaddo, and gets her stories
published in well-known periodicals

45:28.016 --> 45:31.646
that normal people have actually heard of,
like The New Yorker, for instance.

45:31.812 --> 45:32.862
And they're over 40

45:32.938 --> 45:35.728
and still have to live in
a rent-stabilized apartment on Avenue A

45:35.816 --> 45:38.436
with drunks and graffiti in the front,
so don't talk to me

45:38.527 --> 45:42.197
about 'the sacrifices' you're making
to be an artist, okay?"

45:48.787 --> 45:49.657
So good.

46:07.973 --> 46:09.183
Don't you ever miss it?

46:10.601 --> 46:11.771
You guys were so great.

46:12.394 --> 46:13.734
Tell that to the NEA.

46:18.108 --> 46:19.738
Oh, I meant to tell you,

46:19.818 --> 46:23.568
I went by our old space on Walker Street.
You know what it is now?

46:23.655 --> 46:25.115
-No.
-Citibank.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.489
-Ugh.
-My God.

46:27.493 --> 46:29.873
Try doing Grotowski in front of an ATM.

46:33.540 --> 46:37.000
"This was the year that
a small downtown theater collective

46:37.085 --> 46:41.005
reminded us of the singular power
of theater to astonish.

46:41.548 --> 46:46.348
In Tray, a story set among cafeteria
workers in a suburban high school,

46:46.553 --> 46:50.223
La Rata and its director, Richard Grimes,
created a political comedy

46:50.307 --> 46:54.517
that deftly examines the racial
and socioeconomic divide

46:54.603 --> 46:56.063
that plagues our nation."

46:57.606 --> 46:58.476
Who wrote that?

46:59.441 --> 47:01.571
-Jonathan Saks, The Village Voice.
-Oh.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.204
See, that's how sad we are.

47:04.696 --> 47:07.906
We're from a time when
The Village Voice was considered relevant.

47:18.168 --> 47:18.998
Honey.

47:20.128 --> 47:21.208
Honey, are you awake?

47:21.755 --> 47:24.585
-Richard?
-Yeah. What?

47:27.511 --> 47:28.971
Do you think we should do it?

47:30.639 --> 47:31.519
Do what?

47:33.016 --> 47:34.096
Ask Sadie.

47:36.019 --> 47:37.939
She's so young.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.530
Yeah, that's the point, isn't it?

48:04.256 --> 48:05.166
Okay.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.023
-Hey.
-Wow!

48:19.479 --> 48:21.939
How Instagrammable, thank you!

48:24.818 --> 48:26.028
Do you need a...?

48:26.612 --> 48:27.452
Yum.

48:29.364 --> 48:30.324
Thank you.

48:36.705 --> 48:39.415
Oh, my God, look at us.
We're like an ad for assholes.

48:41.710 --> 48:45.460
You mean we're assholes, or we're part
of an ad that's targeted to assholes?

48:45.631 --> 48:47.631
No, it's just that whole...

48:48.008 --> 48:54.008
people with cappuccinos in their lofts,
with their laptops, dogs, with messy hair.

48:55.474 --> 48:57.394
You know, that whole fantasy.

49:00.187 --> 49:03.227
It's not your fault. You guys are
authentic and real, you've just been

49:03.482 --> 49:06.572
co-opted by cultural mechanisms
that create desirability.

49:08.236 --> 49:11.696
I took a media and consumer society
course. It was pretty life-altering.

49:16.536 --> 49:17.746
Sadie...

49:18.372 --> 49:19.962
there's something that we want to...

49:21.792 --> 49:23.502
Look at-- Just--

49:24.753 --> 49:26.923
You know I only have one testicle, right?

49:32.844 --> 49:34.054
Yeah, I do, actually.

49:35.305 --> 49:37.385
-You do?
-Charlie mentioned it once.

49:37.683 --> 49:40.023
-He did?
-Not to me personally, but to my mom.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.603
I overheard it
a couple of Thanksgivings ago.

49:43.063 --> 49:43.943
I don't remember.

49:45.899 --> 49:49.149
It was when you guys were going through
all that fertility stuff.

49:51.405 --> 49:54.405
We're still going through
all that fertility stuff.

49:54.574 --> 49:58.414
-My mom said you were trying to adopt.
-Yeah, we are.

49:58.912 --> 50:02.832
But recently we decided it might be
a good idea to just try everything

50:02.916 --> 50:04.076
all at once.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.997
'Cause, you know,
we're not getting any younger.

50:07.087 --> 50:10.257
-That's for sure.
-Yeah. And we just had a failed IVF.

50:12.718 --> 50:13.718
Wait, what?

50:15.804 --> 50:18.314
-Oh, my God, you guys, I'm so sorry.
-Thanks.

50:19.182 --> 50:20.062
That must suck.

50:22.894 --> 50:25.484
It's not over, though.
You guys are gonna keep trying, right?

50:26.064 --> 50:26.904
Well...

50:27.441 --> 50:31.401
now the doctor is suggesting a...
a different approach altogether.

50:31.945 --> 50:35.525
My mom told me you guys had a lot going on
but I had no idea.

50:36.158 --> 50:39.538
Is... This is a really bad time
for me to be crashing here, isn't it?

50:39.619 --> 50:41.829
-No, not at all.
-I have friends in Bushwick...

50:41.913 --> 50:43.583
No, we're so glad that you're here!

50:43.665 --> 50:44.955
-You're sure?
-Yes.

50:46.752 --> 50:47.712
Me, too.

50:49.212 --> 50:50.422
I love you guys.

51:00.098 --> 51:00.968
Okay.

51:01.808 --> 51:03.808
-I'll pop in some more toast.
-Good idea.

51:04.352 --> 51:07.232
Oh, does anybody mind if I get started
on the crossword?

51:15.197 --> 51:17.527
Actually, we wanted to ask you
about your eggs.

51:18.450 --> 51:21.660
Scrambled is good, but however you guys
do them is fine with me.

51:44.184 --> 51:45.024
Oh.

51:45.393 --> 51:46.523
-Hey!
-Hey!

51:54.444 --> 51:55.704
Did you mean hay...

51:56.238 --> 51:59.068
-with an "A"?
-No, just "hey" as in "hello."

51:59.324 --> 52:02.494
-Sam, this is my niece Sadie. Sadie, Sam.
-Hi.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.909
-Hi.
-Sadie's gonna help out here for a while.

52:04.996 --> 52:06.616
I thought you could show her the ropes.

52:06.706 --> 52:08.496
Yeah, okay. Cool.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.456
Okay. Come on.

52:11.044 --> 52:12.714
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

52:15.173 --> 52:18.513
I like to be as prepared as possible
the night before the farmers' market,

52:18.593 --> 52:20.683
because, well,

52:21.596 --> 52:24.136
we set up at like, 5:00 a.m.,

52:24.391 --> 52:26.561
and at that hour I am...

52:26.893 --> 52:31.233
utterly impaired, and not in a position
to make any kind of business decisions.

52:37.529 --> 52:40.239
Oh, my God, I'm totally whale-tailing,
aren't I?

52:40.323 --> 52:41.323
Sorry.

52:43.243 --> 52:44.373
It's cool.

52:51.084 --> 52:53.964
-I would get a gourmet...
-How often do you guys get this?

52:57.257 --> 53:00.217
-You have no idea!
-You haven't been here!

53:00.594 --> 53:01.764
No crema.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.102
I got extra guac.

53:03.680 --> 53:06.180
-Stop.
-You're getting pico de gallo?

53:06.266 --> 53:07.806
This is not his first rodeo.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.596
My burrito's without cheese, right?

53:10.896 --> 53:13.146
-Yeah.
-Okay. It smells so good.

53:14.149 --> 53:15.189
We got it all.

53:17.694 --> 53:19.704
Oh, my God. What does that even mean?

53:21.489 --> 53:24.159
It's like an open invitation for assholes.

53:25.076 --> 53:26.286
Yes, it is.

53:26.536 --> 53:29.746
Oh, my God, my esophagus is
on fucking fire. I love this.

53:34.127 --> 53:35.127
Sadie.

53:38.715 --> 53:41.755
Rachel and I have been looking for
an egg donor.

53:43.929 --> 53:45.389
You know what that is, right?

53:47.933 --> 53:49.353
Yeah, I do.

53:49.851 --> 53:53.561
They advertise for it at school.
I know somebody who did it, a film major.

53:54.689 --> 53:58.569
They paid her like $10,000.
That's how she financed her senior thesis.

53:58.652 --> 54:00.782
It was the entire budget
of her short film.

54:01.112 --> 54:03.622
She named the company "Ovum Productions."

54:06.660 --> 54:08.290
It was really funny at the time.

54:09.079 --> 54:10.079
Not so much now.

54:10.538 --> 54:11.458
No, that's funny.

54:11.539 --> 54:14.249
-You know...
-No, no, no. It is. It is.

54:18.505 --> 54:21.675
Well, we wanted to ask you
about your eggs, actually.

54:23.343 --> 54:25.973
In your ovaries.

54:29.432 --> 54:30.812
Oh, okay.

54:31.977 --> 54:32.807
What about them?

54:37.274 --> 54:38.114
Well...

54:39.442 --> 54:41.992
we were wondering if you would consider...

54:45.949 --> 54:47.029
donating some.

54:48.618 --> 54:49.538
To us.

54:51.746 --> 54:54.166
-Just like your friend.
-Yeah, except not.

54:54.249 --> 54:55.959
No, no. Yes. Yes.

54:56.418 --> 54:57.248
Because...

54:58.461 --> 55:00.631
you know us, so it would be different.

55:07.178 --> 55:08.008
Wow.

55:12.517 --> 55:13.347
Yeah.

55:18.273 --> 55:19.943
What would this entail, exactly?

55:23.069 --> 55:26.069
Well, technically, you would just
go through pretty much

55:26.323 --> 55:28.533
what I just went through with IVF,
minus the...

55:28.992 --> 55:30.742
-transfer.
-What's the transfer?

55:30.827 --> 55:34.287
That's when they put
the fertilized eggs back into your uterus.

55:34.372 --> 55:38.382
-My uterus, in this case.
-Right, yeah. Yes.

55:38.501 --> 55:41.921
It wouldn't be yours,
because it would be Rachel's.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.335
So...

55:44.841 --> 55:48.141
Yeah, your uterus would not be involved
in this instance.

55:48.303 --> 55:51.143
You would be done right after
the retrieval, so...

55:52.807 --> 55:56.347
You'd have to get screened

55:56.436 --> 55:57.596
by the clinic first.

55:57.812 --> 56:00.232
Bunch of blood tests,
a psychiatric evaluation.

56:00.315 --> 56:02.975
-Uh-oh!
-No, no, it's nothing like that.

56:03.068 --> 56:06.528
They just wanna make sure you would
be able to handle the whole thing,

56:06.905 --> 56:07.855
psychologically.

56:08.156 --> 56:10.866
Right, so I don't go
all Mary Beth Whitehead on you?

56:12.077 --> 56:12.907
Who?

56:14.371 --> 56:17.081
Er, no, nothing, forget it. It's...

56:17.582 --> 56:18.922
-Who was that again?
-Yeah.

56:19.125 --> 56:22.455
The-- Just something we read about
in a medical ethics class.

56:24.089 --> 56:27.089
The surrogate in the Baby M case.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.087
In the '80s.

56:29.344 --> 56:32.604
Yeah, yeah. She refused to give up
the baby or something, right?

56:33.640 --> 56:35.850
Yeah. Sorry.

56:36.184 --> 56:39.234
-Creepy reference. Totally inappropriate.
-No.

56:39.396 --> 56:40.606
That's okay. Okay.

56:42.065 --> 56:42.935
So...

56:44.818 --> 56:45.688
what else?

56:49.406 --> 56:52.736
-The drugs?
-Yes, right. The stimulating hormones.

56:52.992 --> 56:53.952
How could I forget?

56:54.577 --> 56:59.077
You give yourself injections to
increase your egg count for the cycle.

56:59.374 --> 57:01.924
Yeah. It's a lot of...

57:02.460 --> 57:04.840
shots. Let me show you here.
You see them?

57:05.296 --> 57:06.666
-God. Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

57:06.756 --> 57:08.876
I mean, this looks a lot worse than it is.

57:08.967 --> 57:10.717
But the drugs can make you feel...

57:11.553 --> 57:13.563
pretty crazy, mood-wise.

57:14.055 --> 57:17.555
My shrink had a really funny name for it.
What did she call it again?

57:18.476 --> 57:21.346
-"Emotionally incontinent."
-Oh, my God, gross!

57:21.688 --> 57:25.648
But because it's not you trying to have
the baby directly,

57:25.984 --> 57:28.494
it would be way less fraught,
emotionally.

57:28.736 --> 57:30.406
-Don't you think?
-Definitely.

57:30.488 --> 57:31.318
Yeah.

57:32.365 --> 57:34.025
And, of course, we would pay you.

57:34.701 --> 57:36.871
No way, I'm not taking money
from you guys.

57:36.953 --> 57:37.953
No. We insist.

57:38.037 --> 57:40.867
We'd pay you exactly what you would get
in any of the university clinics.

57:40.957 --> 57:42.917
Ten thousand dollars,
just like your friend.

57:44.544 --> 57:49.224
It's not a lot of money, considering.
But it's the standard rate, and it's...

57:50.383 --> 57:51.893
it's all we can afford.

57:56.181 --> 57:58.181
You don't have to say anything now.

58:05.690 --> 58:06.520
This...

58:09.527 --> 58:12.277
It's... It's just an overview.

58:16.784 --> 58:18.414
It's a lot to absorb, so just...

58:18.953 --> 58:21.663
take your time and think about it.

58:30.340 --> 58:31.170
Okay.

58:31.591 --> 58:32.631
-Good.
-Okay.

58:33.218 --> 58:34.048
All right.

58:35.845 --> 58:37.465
-Who needs more beer?
-I do!

58:37.639 --> 58:40.809
No. I mean, okay, like, I'll do it.

58:41.142 --> 58:42.602
The egg thing. I'll do it.

58:43.728 --> 58:46.058
You really need to think.
This is a big decision.

58:46.147 --> 58:49.027
-You don't have to answer right now.
-I'm totally cool with it.

58:49.400 --> 58:53.240
It's not like I'm doing anything else
with my life. I don't even have a job.

58:53.696 --> 58:54.526
And...

58:55.823 --> 58:59.543
what could be more rewarding than
helping two people I love start a family?

59:02.121 --> 59:04.621
You guys have always been
such role models for me.

59:05.708 --> 59:07.458
You're so supportive, and...

59:08.545 --> 59:10.045
non-judgmental.

59:11.881 --> 59:13.681
You're gonna be amazing parents.

59:14.509 --> 59:16.009
Way better than mine.

59:16.261 --> 59:18.681
Hey. Don't say that.
You have great parents.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.683
We're gonna have to tell them
about this, too, you know.

59:23.393 --> 59:26.483
It has to all be out in the open.
Totally transparent.

59:26.563 --> 59:28.193
I don't see a problem with that.

59:29.357 --> 59:30.187
Yeah?

59:30.316 --> 59:33.856
-You don't?
-My mom's always on me about...

59:34.612 --> 59:37.662
finding purpose
and doing something real with my life.

59:39.200 --> 59:41.620
Well, it doesn't get more real than this,
right?

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.065
Be careful!

01:00:13.484 --> 01:00:15.614
All right? Did you hear me?

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.170
Lunatic, are you filming me like that?

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:36.259
It's just gonna be my bald spot!
That's all it's gonna be.

01:01:01.866 --> 01:01:02.946
They're here!

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.334
Hey, guys!

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:08.962
Come on!

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.963
How's everything? You made good time.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:15.875
You brought your laundry?

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:17.127
Yeah, I did.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.377
-Good.
-Hey!

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:19.296
Hi.

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:23.104
It's, like, quarters only,
and the laundromat had no--

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.679
-Hi, Sadie!
-Hi!

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.640
-How are you?
-Oh, my God!

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.557
Hi! It's so good to see you!

01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:35.528
Charlotte! Are you okay?

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:39.699
You brought pie?

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:50.999
I'll get you the rest
before the end of the year!

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:01.630
Come here!

01:02:03.678 --> 01:02:05.928
That's okay. I'm so embarrassed.
This is like...

01:02:06.013 --> 01:02:09.933
Don't be sorry, I didn't realize you were
so sensitive. Is it okay if I go back?

01:02:10.017 --> 01:02:12.647
-Go ahead, please. Sorry.
-Mom? How many?

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.309
How many what?

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.398
-Hi, Nellie! Hi, Jennifer.
-Hi!

01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:18.943
You'll play later, right?

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.407
Thank you.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.037
They're super comfy. Do you want it?

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:36.957
I would love it.

01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:39.051
So, I'm not gonna use my...

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:42.220
You know how, like,
all college grads are like...

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.390
That's so creepy.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:47.639
Like, looking down the shirts of girls,
like when we walk around,

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.352
we don't have to do anything.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.642
I'm in, like, all AP classes.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.733
Well, you did that to yourself.

01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:55.811
No, but I have to do that.

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.225
I wanna get in.

01:02:57.565 --> 01:02:58.565
You're gonna get in.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:02.986
Okay, but if I wasn't doing that whole--
Yeah, I can't change it.

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.281
Charlie? Charlie...

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:09.198
-I cannot manage that.
-Because they don't teach us as kids.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.410
Okay.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:17.208
Charlie and I decided that we wanted
to do Thanksgiving right for a change,

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:19.553
so before we all dig in,

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:23.169
we'd like to invite everyone
to go around the table

01:03:23.424 --> 01:03:26.394
and talk about what it is
you're grateful for this year.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:31.183
-Come on.
-It'll be a "Thanksgiving" Thanksgiving.

01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:33.555
Thank you, Charlie, my supportive husband.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.313
Okay, I think I'm going to begin.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:40.442
I would like to say that I am
very thankful to Richard and Rachel.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:41.645
-Hell, yeah.
-Wow.

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.034
Woo!

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:46.775
For giving our daughter, Sadie,

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:51.948
all the great love and support she needs
for starting her new life in Manhattan,

01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.788
and giving her a great home base.

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:57.995
And, I just want to say
on a personal note, I know that

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.883
you guys have been going through
a really tough time,

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:04.423
and the fact that you're taking care of
someone else's child

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.089
when you're struggling
to have a child of your own

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:11.255
is just more evidence
of your incredible generosity.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:14.727
And... I really hope someday that

01:04:15.142 --> 01:04:18.232
we can repay you for all that you guys
have done for us, so cheers.

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:21.767
-Hear! Hear!
-Cheers!

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.648
Cheers.

01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:26.151
-Okay.
-Can I be next?

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:28.614
Yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Sadie, go.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:31.203
Okay.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.537
That was beautiful.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:36.334
And it's the perfect prologue
for what I wanted to say.

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:39.081
I'm also thankful for Richard and Rachel

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:42.126
-for everything they've done for me.
-Never been so popular.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:47.551
From letting me intern
at their theater company...

01:04:47.633 --> 01:04:49.223
Free labor is more like it.

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:53.432
...to employing me
at the Pickle Guy offices and...

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:57.808
most recently, letting me crash at
their place until I get my act together.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:00.728
I'm especially thankful to you, Rachel.

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:06.989
For reading all of my lame attempts
at playwriting and short fiction.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:13.661
And for taking me seriously as an artist
when I have a hard time doing that myself.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:19.751
And, finally,

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:23.671
this seems like the perfect opportunity
to share some exciting news.

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.208
I'm going rogue here.

01:05:25.546 --> 01:05:28.666
I haven't asked Richard and Rachel,
but I can't let this moment go to waste.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.218
-It's okay.
-No, I don't think--

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:33.721
What I'm most thankful for this year
is the opportunity

01:05:33.804 --> 01:05:36.434
to help Richard and Rachel
make their dreams come true.

01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:41.017
-Sadie, it's not-- Seriously.
-By offering them a tiny bit of myself,

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:44.573
I get to give these guys the greatest gift
they could have asked for.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:46.863
The gift of life.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:51.985
An oocyte.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.789
I don't understand. What is an oocyte?

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:03.706
Isn't it...

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.127
like an egg?

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.927
I've decided to be
Richard and Rachel's egg donor.

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.761
And, if all goes well,

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:16.757
by this time next year,

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:20.274
we'll all be giving thanks for the newest
member of our family:

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:22.647
Richard and Rachel's baby.

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:25.727
Cheers.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:27.356
-We haven't even--
-It's...

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:31.566
Yes!

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:34.486
Yeah! Yes, it's good news! It's good news.
Cheers!

01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:36.948
We haven't even...

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:41.865
-I was gonna-- We haven't coordinated--
-It's my turn now, right?

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.746
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-What?

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.673
On this fabulous Thanksgiving,

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.335
spending it with family and friends,

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:51.172
I am most grateful for

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:54.137
being 31 days sober today.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.388
Clean and sober 31 days.

01:06:57.471 --> 01:06:59.521
Over my dead body! Do you hear me?

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:01.888
This has nothing to do with your body.
It's my body...

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:06.146
It's not blood or checking the organ
donation box on your driver's license.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.610
You'll be living with this all your life.
Our whole family will be affected.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.652
-I've given it a lot of thought.
-Have you?

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:15.196
-I wanna help them. It means a lot to me.
-Well, now it's fun.

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:18.371
You're the center of attention,
but and after the baby's born? What then?

01:07:18.492 --> 01:07:23.292
I'll be Aunt Sadie, or Cousin Sadie,
whatever they want me to be. Look, Mom...

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:28.002
What if you had kidney disease, and
I'm your friend and I have two kidneys?

01:07:28.252 --> 01:07:31.262
Person only needs one kidney, right?
Of course I'd give it to you!

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.180
Honey, kidney disease kills people.
Rachel wants a baby, she's not dying.

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:39.309
-How do you know?
-Sorry. We were planning to talk to you.

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:40.308
That's nice.

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:42.599
How were you planning on paying for it?
Kickstarter?

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:43.683
Jesus, Mom!

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:47.059
-Why don't we go upstairs and get you--
-Whose side are you on?

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.556
Nobody's side, nobody's side.

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:50.517
We're not doing this without your support.

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.608
Well, you don't have it.

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.584
So, guys, why don't you just...

01:08:00.826 --> 01:08:01.656
Fuck this!

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:05.206
...get some food, go home and then
we'll talk about it some other time, okay?

01:08:05.372 --> 01:08:07.672
-Where are you going?
-I'm getting my laundry!

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.300
God, Mom. You are so anti-Aunt Rachel.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.876
-I'm not anti-anybody.
-Come on!

01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:16.715
On some level, you're threatened by her.

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:20.930
'Cause she'll have a book and a baby and
you'll have nothing once Charlotte's gone?

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.639
That's what you think I'm worried about?

01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:25.564
I am worried about you, Sadie.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:28.444
You could be squandering
your future fertility for all you know.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.481
My God, you should be freezing your eggs,
not selling them.

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:34.185
That's absurd.
Tons of girls do it and they're fine.

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.736
Anyway, I'm not having kids.

01:08:36.403 --> 01:08:37.662
You do not know that now.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.029
Yes, I do. I don't want kids,
I want a career.

01:08:40.323 --> 01:08:41.374
You could have both.

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:45.116
What?

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:48.002
Do you know how many times you've told me

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.841
that women have to sacrifice things
when they have kids?

01:08:51.585 --> 01:08:54.165
That you had to drop out of school
when you had me?

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:59.215
I get my period every month,
and I flush an egg down the toilet.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.426
Why not give some to Richard and Rachel?

01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:04.810
What could be more meaningful than me

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:08.729
giving two people I love who are desperate
to start a family the gift of life?

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:09.981
Oh, my God.

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:13.363
-They've brainwashed you.
-Oh...

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.948
Why do you feel so cheated by life, Mom?

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.620
And if I can just make it through today...

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:25.788
just today...

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:29.328
I will be one third of the way through
the Bermuda Triangle.

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:30.915
I am not happy about this!

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.250
Maybe we should've gone with
an anonymous donor.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.881
-Goddammit.
-This is not a good idea!

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:37.591
Honey!

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.466
I know you want a child,

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.350
-but this is my child we're talking about.
-I am not a child!

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.679
-Understood, Cynthia.
-If she was your daughter,

01:09:45.764 --> 01:09:47.024
would you want her to do this?

01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:49.639
-Goodnight. Come on, okay?
-Cynthia, we haven't even--

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:51.439
-Okay. Thanks!
-Sadie!

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.979
-This is madness.
-We're gonna call you in--

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:26.679
Third-party reproduction is usually
an arrangement

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.184
between anonymous
or unrelated individuals.

01:10:33.854 --> 01:10:38.074
But some couples prefer to involve
a family member,

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:40.440
or a trusted friend, which is fine.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:44.782
As long as all the people involved
are consenting adults,

01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:46.775
it should not be a problem.

01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:53.365
Now, that's not to say that
this kind of collaboration

01:10:53.457 --> 01:10:56.997
doesn't bring up some intense feelings
for everyone,

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.836
including the extended family.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:10:59.921
Of course it does.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:02.510
This is uncharted territory
for most people.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.971
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:09.643
We don't even know if Sadie's
an appropriate candidate for egg donation.

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:15.193
My advice is to get the process started,

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:17.691
and then use the time
to wrap your heads around

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:20.443
what this arrangement might mean
for you and your family.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:31.747
Then, after the reports come back

01:11:31.912 --> 01:11:35.292
and Sadie's completed
her psychological evaluation...

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:42.546
...you can sit down and make
a fully-informed decision.

01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:11.826
I call him Uncle Richard,
but he's actually

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.000
my stepfather Charlie's brother.

01:12:14.705 --> 01:12:16.245
So we're not really related.

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.291
Which is probably better
for something like this.

01:12:20.794 --> 01:12:21.634
Right.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:25.337
Because... otherwise, it would be incest.

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:29.894
For the record, I don't have a problem
with the whole donor thing.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.765
Not to say I don't think it's weird.
It's weird, but...

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:36.135
I'm a periodontist.

01:12:36.226 --> 01:12:40.806
I graft freeze-dried cadaver bones into
the mouths of living people every day.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.018
I can handle weird.

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:43.688
Ugh!

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:47.357
But Cynthia?

01:12:48.572 --> 01:12:51.912
She's different, she's much more
sensitive, especially these days.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.618
She's been having a really tough time...

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.367
hormonally.

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.860
Honey...

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:33.579
they're screening her.

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:35.948
Who's screening her?

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:39.293
The clinic for the egg donation.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:45.959
-You might wanna talk to her about it.
-She doesn't need my permission.

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.717
Well, that's true, she doesn't.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.432
Honey,
what if Richard and Rachel were gay?

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:58.314
-Please!
-No, I'm serious. What would you say?

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.520
If they were a gay male couple
and they wanted to start a family

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:02.983
and Sadie wanted to help them.

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.150
I would say, "Mazel tov.

01:14:05.232 --> 01:14:08.492
Now go get some girl off the internet
and leave us out of it."

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.868
Sadie doesn't understand what it is
she's doing. She's just...

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:16.078
throwing around her genetic material
like it's popcorn.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:19.332
Auctioning off family property
like it's no big deal.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:24.497
Well, they're family.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:27.457
-What?
-Richard and Rachel are family.

01:14:33.927 --> 01:14:37.507
-What are you doing? Oh, my God--
-There's something on your chin.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:39.978
-Can you not, please? Do you mind?
-It's bleeding.

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:43.477
It's nothing. It's a pimple.
My God, Charlie, please.

01:14:43.937 --> 01:14:46.057
Don't touch me. I'm trying to concentrate.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.515
I got into Berkeley!

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.938
-What!
-My early decision letter came. I got in!

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:53.408
-Oh, my God, let me see!
-I'm going to Berkeley!

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:56.866
You did it! I'm so proud of you!

01:14:57.117 --> 01:15:01.707
-We are so proud of her, right, Cyn?
-It's great, honey, I'm so happy for you.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.212
What happened to your face, Mom?

01:15:07.711 --> 01:15:10.511
It's nothing. It's just a little...

01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:16.676
It's-- It's just this...

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:18.101
pimple.

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:20.059
Stupid. Just...

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.190
We'll meet you downstairs, okay?

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:26.100
Oh, okay.

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:28.113
It's okay, it's okay.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:44.999
"Ms. Sadie Barrett has applied to become
a donor in the Conceptions Oocyte

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.042
Donor Program.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:48.923
The purpose of this evaluation
is to gain insight

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:51.962
into her psychological
and emotional well-being.

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:57.009
Psychological testing indicates no
significant evidence of psychopathology."

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:59.474
-Woo! Yeah!
-Awesome!

01:15:59.596 --> 01:16:01.176
Wait, this is the good part.

01:16:01.306 --> 01:16:06.226
"Ms. Barrett presented as a bright,
sophisticated, and charismatic young woman

01:16:06.311 --> 01:16:09.021
who appears comfortable
with her decision to donate.

01:16:09.606 --> 01:16:12.726
She is mature and intelligent
and it is likely that she will

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:15.448
comply with the medical demands
of the donation.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:19.947
In conclusion, Ms. Barrett is approved
as a candidate for oocyte donation."

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.079
-Yeah! Yes!
-Yes!

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.960
-I was a little worried.
-I was very worried about you.

01:16:25.038 --> 01:16:25.958
Psychiatric!

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.418
You passed?

01:16:27.541 --> 01:16:29.421
Why are you so surprised?

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:30.790
I'm not, I'm just...

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:32.589
You know, I thought maybe...

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:41.641
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.096
You know that I love you, right?

01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:51.439
Even though I don't agree with you,
at all...

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:53.612
I respect you,

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:57.654
and if this project is something you feel
you need to do, then you should do it.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.990
So you're cool with it?

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:03.664
No, I'm not "cool" with it.
I'm not cool with anything, ever.

01:17:05.203 --> 01:17:07.163
But I see how much this means to you,

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:11.171
and I don't want to stand in your way.
I want to support you. No matter what.

01:17:12.252 --> 01:17:13.132
You do?

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.585
Doesn't mean I'm happy about it.

01:17:28.018 --> 01:17:29.518
Wow! Christmas!

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.230
What does this stuff do?

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:37.244
It shuts down our reproductive systems
so they can sync up our cycles.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:39.660
Yikes.

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.622
Any risk of, like, triggering menopause?

01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:46.906
Technically, it is menopause.
It's chemically-induced, it's temporary.

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.785
Okay, I'm gonna start with Rachel.

01:17:48.872 --> 01:17:49.962
-All right.
-Yup.

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.674
-There you go.
-All right.

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:55.796
All right.

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:57.461
Ready?

01:17:57.547 --> 01:17:59.877
One, two, three.

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:03.851
See?

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:07.886
-Subcutaneous. No biggie.
-All righty, your turn.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.939
Oh, my God, this is so glamorous.
We're like Drugstore Cowboy.

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:32.495
All done.

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:42.054
He wants me to start stimming.

01:18:50.475 --> 01:18:54.145
Warning: this stuff can make you feel
really crazy and all over the place.

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:57.229
"Emotionally incontinent." I remember.
Don't worry. I can handle it.

01:18:57.315 --> 01:18:58.855
One, two, three.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:01.149
-Oh! Shit!
-One, two...

01:19:08.201 --> 01:19:09.411
Oh, I love it!

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:12.214
Are you sure you don't want it?
It's in perfect condition.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.593
No, it's... better for you.
I can't wear that anymore.

01:19:16.668 --> 01:19:20.548
Oh, no. You're not gonna start...
draping, are you?

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.930
God, my mom went on this jag
where she got rid of, like,

01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:28.011
everything in her closet
that was even remotely form-fitting,

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:29.676
and now it's just like cowl necks,

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:34.635
and tunics, and draw strings, and shawls,
that whole Eileen Fisher thing.

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:36.858
It's like she doesn't even
have a body anymore,

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:41.648
she's just drowning inside all this fabric
and erased all sexuality from her being.

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:43.235
It's like she's been spayed.

01:19:46.823 --> 01:19:50.493
Can I use some of your lotion?
My skin is so dry. I'm molting.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:52.753
Yeah, sure, whatever's there.

01:20:01.254 --> 01:20:03.224
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:07.177
My boobs are so big from those drugs,
I look like a porn star.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:14.561
You're gonna be such a great mom.

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:18.059
I am?

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:20.228
Uh-huh. Totally.

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:21.895
I wish you were my mom.

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:24.902
-What? That's crazy.
-No, it's not.

01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:26.945
I think of you like that sometimes.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:31.491
Like, you're my art mom,
and Richard is my art dad,

01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:33.203
and I'm your art daughter.

01:20:34.871 --> 01:20:39.041
And now it's gonna be, like, so intense,
because a little part of me,

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:43.169
mixed with a little part of him,
is gonna be growing inside of you.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.804
Do you think Sam is attractive?

01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:57.345
-What?
-Sam, who works at Pickle Guy?

01:20:59.312 --> 01:21:02.272
I don't know.
I never thought about it before.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.315
I think he's attractive

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:07.701
in a kind of "fucked-up character
in a Sam Shepard play" way.

01:21:09.614 --> 01:21:11.164
Broken, but hot.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:16.828
Do you think our baby will grow up
to be a writer?

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:20.249
Yours and Sam's?

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:21.708
No, yours and mine.

01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:31.141
Shit, it's my editor.

01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:34.639
-Hi, Liz.
-Have you seen it?

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:38.140
No. Seen what?

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:39.848
-Sorry.
-The book jacket.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.066
Okay. Okay.

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:46.069
Holding, holding, holding...

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:49.565
Okay.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:57.408
Are you there?

01:22:03.376 --> 01:22:05.296
It totally misrepresents the book.

01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:09.218
Then it's like, oh, I don't understand
the business side, which I don't.

01:22:09.799 --> 01:22:13.719
But I do know if a guy wrote it,
it wouldn't be packaged like a cupcake.

01:22:13.803 --> 01:22:16.313
So sick of this shit.

01:22:16.848 --> 01:22:20.098
Same thing with this whole fertility
nightmare. I just feel so betrayed.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:21.192
By what?

01:22:21.394 --> 01:22:24.114
You know,
the bullshit I was fed in college.

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.646
Feminist ideology.

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:29.737
The lie that I could have a career
and then kids.

01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:31.859
Well, obviously that hasn't panned out.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.527
Should send them the bills
for our IUI's and IVF's.

01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:38.996
You can't blame second-wave feminism
for our ambivalence about having a kid.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.035
I'm not ambivalent.

01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:44.878
No, now you're not.

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:47.875
Because you realize that the boat
is leaving the dock. But...

01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:51.511
before, you kept changing the deadline.
Remember?

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:55.604
You know, "We'll start
as soon as I finish the play,"

01:22:56.262 --> 01:22:58.522
"right after I get this story published,"

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.274
"once I finish the book."

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:02.393
Are you blaming me?

01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:06.194
No, I'm not blaming you.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:11.025
I'm just saying that we need to take
some responsibility for the situation.

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:15.315
A lot of women have babies at 41.
I thought I could, too.

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:18.454
Okay.

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.907
I just don't think
it's Gloria Steinem's fault

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.367
that we can't get pregnant.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.794
Whose fault is it, then?

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:29.298
I guess it is mine, because I was too busy
writing my stupid book.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:33.510
I didn't say that.

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:39.434
All the doctors ever talk about is
my advanced maternal age, my old eggs.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:42.098
Then we're in the middle of an IVF and,
what a surprise,

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:45.153
your sperm is, like, on a sabbatical.

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:49.857
-Whoa. What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.735
Let's just drop it.

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:54.652
All I'm saying is that we can't blame
Dr. Dordick,

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.358
or Bella Abzug,

01:23:56.489 --> 01:23:58.239
or anybody else for our fuck-up.

01:23:58.324 --> 01:23:59.874
You mean my fuck-up!

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.905
Why do I feel like
I'm in a Wendy Wasserstein play?

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:06.326
I don't know, but it's our anniversary
and I've got to go get a...

01:24:07.083 --> 01:24:09.293
dildo cam shoved up my twat
by Dr. Dordick,

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:12.707
so can we just not talk about this
right now, and just repress it?

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:16.683
Or suppress it, or whichever one
is more appropriate for this instant,

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.800
so we can just keep this train on track?

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:22.137
It's "suppress."

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:28.190
When you consciously forget something,
that's suppression.

01:24:28.688 --> 01:24:30.188
Repression is unconscious.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.660
-Hey.
-Sadie? You--

01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:27.405
Surprise!

01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:30.875
Happy anniversary.

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.255
-It smells so good.
-Yeah!

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:37.921
Oh, my God!

01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:41.343
"Donny, calm down and have a tonic!"

01:25:41.427 --> 01:25:42.757
Oh, my God!

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.977
Did you ever read Innocence
by Harold Brodkey?

01:25:50.895 --> 01:25:52.265
No, I don't think so.

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:53.734
Me, neither.

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:56.316
It's pretty life-altering.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.525
-Wait, that the Harvard cunnilingus one?
-Yeah, that one.

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:03.367
It's all about a guy going down
on a girl, right?

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:07.701
Yeah. I read it in a contemporary
short fiction class.

01:26:07.829 --> 01:26:09.959
And then, as an assignment, I wrote,

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:15.339
a kind of tongue-in-cheek response to it,
that I called Experience.

01:26:15.461 --> 01:26:16.421
No pun intended.

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:22.218
A "tongue-in-cheek response" to a story
about cunnilingus. Somebody had to say it!

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:23.342
Come on!

01:26:23.803 --> 01:26:25.973
It's still a work in progress, but...

01:26:26.472 --> 01:26:29.602
I was wondering,
if you guys were interested,

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:31.564
I'd love to get your thoughts about it.

01:26:31.644 --> 01:26:33.984
-Oh, my God, yes. I can't wait.
-Absolutely. Sure.

01:26:34.063 --> 01:26:36.233
Oh, God. That would be so great.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:37.976
But it has to be top secret,

01:26:38.067 --> 01:26:42.107
because my mom has been asking to see
my writing all semester

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:45.532
and the thought of her reading about me...

01:26:46.492 --> 01:26:47.742
choking on cock,

01:26:48.244 --> 01:26:50.794
even in a fictional piece, is horrifying.

01:27:02.133 --> 01:27:03.263
It's intense.

01:27:03.843 --> 01:27:06.013
Oh, my God. You don't have to
look at that tonight.

01:27:06.095 --> 01:27:07.215
No, hey.

01:27:07.764 --> 01:27:08.894
It's our anniversary.

01:27:09.432 --> 01:27:11.182
At least I can read about fellatio.

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:12.309
Oh, my God.

01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:18.816
-Yeah, yeah!
-Just kidding.

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:21.777
Bye, guys.

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:23.864
Where you going?

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:26.823
To meet Sam.

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:31.081
Oh. Cool.

01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:32.501
Yeah, cool.

01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:35.416
Well... have a good time.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.589
-Yeah, have fun.
-All right.

01:27:38.169 --> 01:27:39.169
Just don't have sex.

01:27:42.006 --> 01:27:44.046
You know if it-- Just, not right now.

01:27:45.551 --> 01:27:47.101
I'm not planning on having sex with Sam.

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:50.635
No, I know, just, you know,
if it comes up.

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:54.233
You're extremely fertile, at the moment.

01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:57.404
-We're just going to the movies.
-What are you guys seeing?

01:27:58.147 --> 01:28:00.897
Something at Anthology Film Archives.

01:28:01.484 --> 01:28:03.574
Documentary about some music guy.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:09.742
I'm concerned with the fact
that I have not been made a doctorate

01:28:09.826 --> 01:28:12.786
at any college, and Bill Cosby has.

01:28:16.207 --> 01:28:17.327
Even Dylan has.

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:19.884
George Martin is made a Sir.

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:23.051
Paul McCartney is made a Sir.
Elton John is made a Sir.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:25.553
Buddy Holly's given a stamp.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:26.473
You know--

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:29.051
-Definitely not a good date movie.
-No.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:31.967
They should have a warning.
"Should not bring a date to this movie."

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:38.095
-Total vibe kill. Emphasis on "kill."
-Well, I guess I blew it, then.

01:28:39.355 --> 01:28:40.185
What?

01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.070
Our date.

01:28:43.067 --> 01:28:45.697
Oh. Wait, no. This isn't a--

01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:48.735
I thought so.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.195
-Oh.
-It's up to you.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:55.832
Are we...

01:28:58.499 --> 01:29:00.079
on a date?

01:29:01.252 --> 01:29:02.212
Good question.

01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:19.154
Do not freak out.

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.397
We didn't do anything, I swear.

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:23.816
Just, like, cuddled and kissed.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:25.402
Nothing vaginal.

01:29:25.735 --> 01:29:28.565
Okay. I think I'm gonna wait in the car.

01:29:28.988 --> 01:29:30.698
You take my seat, and...

01:29:31.282 --> 01:29:33.372
I'm gonna see you guys after, okay? So...

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:36.449
Oh, my God. The trains were so messed up.

01:29:37.747 --> 01:29:39.247
You missed the appointment.

01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:41.786
Didn't you get my text?

01:29:42.668 --> 01:29:44.458
Texting isn't being here on time.

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:47.631
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:50.125
But, like I told you,
the trains were messed up.

01:29:56.307 --> 01:29:57.387
Where are you going?

01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:58.845
To see if they can get you in.

01:30:01.562 --> 01:30:02.732
So, she just showed up.

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:04.484
Is there any way you can possibly
get her in?

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.605
-Can you guys wait?
-That's fine.

01:30:06.776 --> 01:30:09.146
-Okay. You're welcome.
-Yes. Thank you so much.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:22.793
What did they say?

01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:26.917
They said they can squeeze you in
in half an hour.

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:28.376
Oh, okay. Cool.

01:30:29.215 --> 01:30:30.795
So there's no problem, then.

01:30:36.389 --> 01:30:37.889
I'm gonna wait in the car, too.

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:49.323
Oh, honey.

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:51.450
Hey!

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:53.238
Over here!

01:30:54.323 --> 01:30:55.373
It's pouring!

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:59.197
-I can sit in the back.
-No, no. Sit in the front.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:00.711
Hey!

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:02.419
Man!

01:31:03.499 --> 01:31:07.749
I got you a Green Goddess
with a shot of wheat grass.

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:11.383
Are you okay?

01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:16.304
-Oh, no.
-God.

01:31:17.054 --> 01:31:20.684
Honey, I'm sorry I got so mad.
I think I overreacted.

01:31:22.226 --> 01:31:23.436
That's not it?

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:30.489
The doctor just yelled at me and said
my eggs aren't developing on schedule.

01:31:33.362 --> 01:31:35.242
-What?
-Dordick yelled at you?

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:36.663
Dr. Russell.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.201
-Who's Dr. Russell?
-I think that was his name.

01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.752
He said that I didn't have
enough follicles,

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:45.039
that I'm a "low responder,"

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.538
that someone my age should have way more,

01:31:47.627 --> 01:31:50.507
and my eggs aren't growing
at the right rate or something.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:55.885
He said that he has 41-year-old patients
who produce more eggs than me.

01:31:57.887 --> 01:31:59.057
Oh, my God.

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.233
Honey, what are you doing? What--

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:14.744
I need to talk to Dr. Russell.

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:17.282
I'm sorry, Mr. Grimes,
he's with patients all morning.

01:32:17.657 --> 01:32:19.577
But I can get him a message if you'd like.

01:32:21.452 --> 01:32:25.372
Yeah, okay.
Tell him that my niece is not a chicken.

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:28.998
Write it down. Please.

01:32:29.126 --> 01:32:31.086
Yes, tell him that our donor,

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.342
who is giving us the gift of life,

01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:37.126
-is being treated like a piece of shit.
-Please keep your voice down, Mr. Grimes.

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.718
Is there a problem?

01:32:39.136 --> 01:32:41.096
Dr. Russell, this is Richard Grimes.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:44.429
Oh, hey. Dr. Frank Perdue. How are you?

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:46.019
I'm sorry, what--

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:49.271
Are you? Really? Sorry? Really?

01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:53.531
Because my niece is sitting out there
crying in my car,

01:32:53.693 --> 01:32:56.863
feeling like some kind
of a failed factory farm animal,

01:32:56.946 --> 01:32:59.616
because you told her she's not producing
enough goddamn eggs!

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:01.199
Okay. Should I call security?

01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:03.735
I don't know. You tell me.

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:11.587
Sorry about-- Sorry.

01:33:12.211 --> 01:33:13.591
Sorry. I got it.

01:33:15.381 --> 01:33:17.471
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:33:19.468 --> 01:33:21.468
I'll just collect that with the jacket.

01:33:23.806 --> 01:33:24.636
Shit.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.000
Hi. Hi!

01:33:54.503 --> 01:33:56.423
Those guys driving you crazy up there?

01:33:56.839 --> 01:33:59.009
I've been living in a dorm
for three months.

01:33:59.508 --> 01:34:00.508
That's right.

01:34:05.431 --> 01:34:06.311
You know...

01:34:07.683 --> 01:34:09.693
You can call it quits any time you want.

01:34:10.102 --> 01:34:10.942
Okay?

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.937
Don't worry
about the stupid numbers thing.

01:34:15.066 --> 01:34:16.686
All it takes is one good egg.

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.030
That's what they keep telling us, anyway.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.160
Okay.

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:26.451
-Night.
-Good night.

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:36.459
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:34:37.296 --> 01:34:39.046
-How's it going?
-Good. How are you?

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:41.133
-Good.
-Good.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.968
-I need to...
-Oh, yeah, sure. I'm sorry.

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:01.861
Hey, Sadie?

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.485
Are you freaking out?

01:35:08.285 --> 01:35:11.575
-No. Not really. Should I be?
-No, I...

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.376
You just seem kind of distant.

01:35:19.004 --> 01:35:23.014
-I'm in the bathroom.
-No, about the other morning, you...

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:26.259
you left before I woke up.

01:35:26.929 --> 01:35:27.759
Oh.

01:35:29.014 --> 01:35:30.734
I'm sorry. I was...

01:35:30.933 --> 01:35:34.693
running late for something.
I'm not trying to be coy or anything.

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:36.516
It's just...

01:35:38.482 --> 01:35:41.612
there's a lot of personal shit
I'm dealing with right now.

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:49.327
"Human Chorionic Gonadotropin."

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.660
Jesus. Could it sound more sci-fi?

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:53.456
They call it the trigger shot.

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:57.458
Makes you ovulate, and then
36 hours later, the retrieval,

01:35:57.543 --> 01:36:00.133
and then, finito!

01:36:00.713 --> 01:36:02.473
Okay. You ready?

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:04.797
-Okay.
-All righty.

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.547
Okay.

01:36:10.806 --> 01:36:14.476
All right. One, two, three.

01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:25.357
I guess it's stating the obvious, but...

01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:28.739
we couldn't have done this without you.

01:36:31.368 --> 01:36:33.868
Oh, my God. You know what
we never even talked about?

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:35.659
What?

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:37.706
That whole birthing thing.

01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:40.804
Are you guys gonna do it
at home with, like,

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:46.764
a doula and a bath tub, and placenta?

01:36:47.551 --> 01:36:48.841
Natural childbirth?

01:36:56.268 --> 01:36:58.808
Nothing about this has been natural
so far.

01:37:00.022 --> 01:37:02.272
I don't see why we would start now.

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:14.163
She said I had the most boring job
in the world.

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:19.627
All I do all day is put people to sleep.

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:25.918
Okay. Wow.

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:33.638
Really? Okay.

01:37:34.598 --> 01:37:39.648
They did ICSI on 15 eggs. Six fertilized
and they're waiting on two more.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480
Is that good?

01:37:49.071 --> 01:37:50.281
I'm so happy.

01:37:59.582 --> 01:38:01.582
Did you gain a lot of weight after?

01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:05.250
I swear I've put on, like,
12 pounds in three days.

01:38:07.256 --> 01:38:10.626
Sometimes it takes a while for your body
to re-adjust after all the hormones.

01:38:10.718 --> 01:38:12.088
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.060
Coffee's on the table.
And scrambled eggs and strawberries.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:16.970
Thanks.

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:19.177
-All right. Feel better.
-I will.

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:22.060
-See you later.
-Bye.

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:31.318
How is she gaining weight?
She hasn't eaten anything in two days.

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:34.156
It's water retention. It's totally normal.

01:38:49.131 --> 01:38:50.631
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:38:50.966 --> 01:38:52.336
No one wants that.

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.260
-Me, three.
-Okey-dokey. Here we go.

01:38:57.139 --> 01:38:58.139
You guys...

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:22.080
Hey.

01:39:22.164 --> 01:39:23.924
You okay?

01:39:23.999 --> 01:39:25.789
I don't know. I don't know.

01:39:29.088 --> 01:39:31.548
-What the heck's going on?
-Something feels wrong. I--

01:39:39.056 --> 01:39:42.056
It started a few days ago,
after the retrieval.

01:39:42.893 --> 01:39:44.903
Yeah. We're in the middle of an IVF.

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:46.730
-You're trying to get pregnant?
-No.

01:39:47.022 --> 01:39:48.442
-I am.
-Right.

01:39:49.692 --> 01:39:51.442
I thought you two were her parents.

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:53.072
-Prospective parents.
-Right.

01:39:54.029 --> 01:39:56.869
She's my aunt, he's my uncle.
I'm just the donor.

01:39:56.949 --> 01:39:59.539
-It's complicated.
-I can see that.

01:39:59.868 --> 01:40:01.698
Were there any difficulties
with the retrieval?

01:40:01.787 --> 01:40:02.707
No.

01:40:07.501 --> 01:40:08.541
Actually...

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:11.804
I mean, yeah. Sort of.

01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:14.931
What happened?

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:16.970
Well, I wasn't...

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:21.100
-I didn't have enough follicles...
-Okay.

01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:24.475
...so I increased the dose of Follitropin.

01:40:25.227 --> 01:40:26.187
By how much?

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:27.557
Like...

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:29.192
Oh, my God.

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:31.979
God, that doctor is a fucking idiot.

01:40:32.067 --> 01:40:33.397
No, it wasn't him.

01:40:34.486 --> 01:40:36.486
He didn't make me do it.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.119
I did it myself.

01:40:39.783 --> 01:40:40.623
What?

01:40:43.454 --> 01:40:45.664
I increased the dosage on my own.

01:40:49.126 --> 01:40:50.286
Sadie...

01:40:51.795 --> 01:40:54.795
I just really wanted this to work out
for you guys.

01:40:55.716 --> 01:41:01.136
You've spent so much money.
And I know how much it means to you.

01:41:03.015 --> 01:41:06.305
And I didn't want to disappoint you.

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:11.073
It's okay. It's all right.

01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:24.908
Knock-knock.

01:41:29.708 --> 01:41:33.088
It's okay, Mom. I'm fine.

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.880
They're just observing.

01:41:35.631 --> 01:41:36.971
Sweetheart.

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.375
My baby.

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:44.934
It's not their fault.

01:41:46.016 --> 01:41:47.726
It was me. I was the idiot.

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.807
Discontinue the progesterone,

01:43:55.896 --> 01:44:00.106
the estrogen patches, the Estrace,
as well as the supplements.

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:05.240
Barbara will call next week to schedule
a meeting to talk about next steps.

01:44:07.616 --> 01:44:08.826
I'm sorry, guys.

01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:12.826
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

01:44:29.846 --> 01:44:31.846
-Where are you going?
-Walk the dogs.

01:44:56.164 --> 01:44:57.334
I'm so sad.

01:45:02.045 --> 01:45:02.875
Richard?

01:45:06.508 --> 01:45:09.758
God. Don't those people
ever fucking stop partying?

01:45:12.264 --> 01:45:14.184
Fuck!

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:16.141
Goddamn...

01:45:35.245 --> 01:45:36.325
Did you hear me?

01:45:37.914 --> 01:45:39.504
Yeah, I did.

01:45:44.546 --> 01:45:48.926
And I know, intellectually, that I am
supposed to do something for you now.

01:45:51.345 --> 01:45:55.765
Comfort you, or whatever.
But I'm sorry that I can't.

01:45:59.478 --> 01:46:00.848
I just don't have it in me.

01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:09.110
Okay.

01:46:14.826 --> 01:46:16.866
You're gonna hate me for saying this.

01:46:20.290 --> 01:46:23.380
You're gonna think
it's hideous sacrilege, but...

01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:31.637
I'm actually kinda glad
that the cycle didn't work.

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:36.431
Because at least now it's over.

01:46:42.687 --> 01:46:45.567
I know it's harsh,
but that's honestly how I feel.

01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:47.980
Relieved.

01:46:56.785 --> 01:46:59.195
I don't think I even want to have
a kid anymore.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.580
I just want my life back.

01:47:06.837 --> 01:47:08.627
I mean, look at us. We're a mess.

01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:13.474
It's like we're not even
in a relationship, let alone a marriage.

01:47:13.552 --> 01:47:14.762
I'm not your husband,

01:47:15.053 --> 01:47:18.393
I'm just some guy that injects hormones
into your ass every night.

01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:25.310
We don't even have sex.

01:47:29.067 --> 01:47:31.777
-Wait, is that what this is about? Sex?
-No.

01:47:32.737 --> 01:47:34.027
Yeah. I...

01:47:35.031 --> 01:47:37.621
Well, maybe. I don't know.

01:47:39.494 --> 01:47:42.124
What do you think?
Think we're ever gonna have sex again?

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:48.381
Are you actually asking me that right now,
or are you being theoretical?

01:47:48.837 --> 01:47:51.047
No, I'm not. I'm actually asking you.

01:47:52.257 --> 01:47:54.587
Do you think that we will ever
have sex again?

01:47:58.346 --> 01:47:59.466
I don't know, Richard.

01:48:01.183 --> 01:48:04.603
-You don't know?
-I... Yeah, I mean, yes.

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:07.771
I... Yes. Yes, at some point.

01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:11.072
-At what point will that be, exactly?
-I don't know!

01:48:12.068 --> 01:48:13.858
Why are you so fixated on this?

01:48:14.446 --> 01:48:19.826
I'm not. I am simply pointing out that
since we have been so obsessed...

01:48:20.452 --> 01:48:24.542
with this project, we've had sex
maybe one time in 11 months.

01:48:25.207 --> 01:48:29.207
And you had to get trashed on a bottle
of rosé before you would even consider it!

01:48:30.754 --> 01:48:34.424
I mean, Jesus-- Dr. Dordick is more
intimate with your vagina than I am!

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:37.088
Oh, my God. Do you want sex right now?
Is that it?

01:48:38.553 --> 01:48:40.643
'Cause we just had a failed IVF.

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:44.057
And I don't know about you,
but that makes me feel pretty shitty.

01:48:44.434 --> 01:48:47.444
And dead. And despondent.
And doesn't put me in a...

01:48:47.854 --> 01:48:50.444
particularly erotic frame of mind.

01:48:50.649 --> 01:48:53.399
But if you're dead set on it, you know...

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:56.453
I'm sure we can manage something.

01:48:58.156 --> 01:49:01.696
Just can't guarantee
it's gonna be a hell of a lot of fun.

01:49:01.826 --> 01:49:04.326
Look, battery still works.
It's our lucky day.

01:50:10.687 --> 01:50:12.937
Okay, slow down. It's easy to miss.

01:50:13.315 --> 01:50:15.565
Right there! That's it.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.610
-Hello.
-Hey.

01:50:53.688 --> 01:50:55.688
-Hi!
-Hi, Sadie?

01:50:55.815 --> 01:50:57.435
-Yeah.
-Hey, I'm Jonathan.

01:50:57.901 --> 01:51:00.321
Nice to meet you. This is for you.

01:51:00.403 --> 01:51:01.493
-Cool.
-All right.

01:51:01.905 --> 01:51:04.945
-Hello! Hi, I'm Richard. Nice to meet you.
-Jonathan, nice to meet you.

01:51:05.033 --> 01:51:06.283
-Hi! I'm Rachel.
-My wife, Rachel.

01:51:08.411 --> 01:51:09.581
That's them.

01:51:09.871 --> 01:51:12.371
Spencer and Katrina Trask.

01:51:13.375 --> 01:51:15.375
Our patron saints.

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:18.963
-Terrible luck with children.
-They couldn't have them?

01:51:19.047 --> 01:51:21.717
No, they had four,
but all of them died young.

01:51:21.966 --> 01:51:23.636
Some of them are actually buried here.

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:25.680
And after the children were gone,

01:51:25.845 --> 01:51:30.055
they decided they'd turn their estate into
a place where artists could come and work.

01:51:30.266 --> 01:51:33.306
That's why you're here, that's why
I'm here, that's why everyone's here.

01:51:34.646 --> 01:51:36.106
It's all in your packet, too.

01:51:40.735 --> 01:51:42.815
Holy smokes!

01:51:43.655 --> 01:51:45.655
-Wait. What is...
-Well, well, well!

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.910
-Are you serious?
-Wow!

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:51.196
-Look at this.
-This was Katrina's room.

01:51:51.955 --> 01:51:52.825
Wow.

01:51:52.914 --> 01:51:55.794
Look. You even have
your own fainting couch.

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:57.999
-Wait, this is my room?
-Mm-hm.

01:51:59.504 --> 01:52:00.924
Oh, my God!

01:52:01.256 --> 01:52:04.926
Wow. I've been here three times.
I never got this room.

01:52:05.677 --> 01:52:06.547
This is...

01:52:17.355 --> 01:52:18.185
So...

01:52:19.441 --> 01:52:21.401
we'll get you in, like, a month. Right?

01:52:22.152 --> 01:52:23.782
Actually, you don't need to.

01:52:25.822 --> 01:52:27.162
Sam said he could do it.

01:52:29.993 --> 01:52:32.753
He's just always wanted to see
Saratoga Springs and...

01:52:34.456 --> 01:52:36.326
thought it would save you guys the trip.

01:52:39.335 --> 01:52:42.585
Thank you for whatever strings
you had to pull to get me in here.

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.553
I didn't pull any strings.

01:52:48.553 --> 01:52:51.893
You didn't put in a good word for me?
I thought that's why I got accepted.

01:53:04.736 --> 01:53:05.566
Okay.

01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:19.501
Go get it! Go get it!

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:50.779
Trick or treat!

01:53:50.907 --> 01:53:53.197
Wow. You guys look great!

01:53:53.785 --> 01:53:54.615
What are you?

01:53:55.119 --> 01:53:56.249
Climate change.

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.909
-Ah!
-Who are you?

01:54:01.543 --> 01:54:02.543
Richard Nixon.

01:54:04.087 --> 01:54:06.167
He was the President
from when I was a kid.

01:54:07.257 --> 01:54:10.007
I wanted to wear my Bill Clinton,
but I couldn't find it.

01:54:11.261 --> 01:54:13.051
I guess he's before your time, too.

01:54:16.599 --> 01:54:17.479
Oh, sorry.

01:54:18.977 --> 01:54:21.647
There we go. How's that?

01:54:22.272 --> 01:54:23.232
Thank you.

01:54:23.481 --> 01:54:24.821
-Thank you.
-All right.

01:54:32.991 --> 01:54:34.491
Sorry about the environment!

01:54:44.627 --> 01:54:45.457
Hey.

01:54:46.004 --> 01:54:47.014
Where'd you find it?

01:54:50.258 --> 01:54:51.258
Linen closet.

01:55:26.502 --> 01:55:28.762
-Come here. Come here!
-Where?

01:55:30.465 --> 01:55:31.295
Ah...

01:55:32.467 --> 01:55:33.967
It's the 800 number!

01:55:37.513 --> 01:55:38.603
Here. Answer it.

01:55:39.057 --> 01:55:41.137
-Why me?
-I... Come on!

01:55:41.684 --> 01:55:42.524
Okay.

01:55:43.478 --> 01:55:44.348
Hello?

01:55:45.855 --> 01:55:46.855
Yeah, that's us.

01:55:49.525 --> 01:55:53.655
No, no. We're so happy you called.
This is the perfect time.

01:55:54.572 --> 01:55:55.912
We're just out for...

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:57.489
Halloween.

01:55:58.868 --> 01:56:00.158
Yeah. New York City.

01:56:00.912 --> 01:56:03.792
Well, it's got its pros and cons.
Where are you...

01:56:04.666 --> 01:56:05.626
Where are you from?

01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:07.206
Oh, wow.

01:56:09.128 --> 01:56:11.298
No, we've never been to Virginia.

01:56:30.441 --> 01:56:31.731
Land, ho.

01:56:53.423 --> 01:56:54.473
Thank you.

01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:55.720
-You good?
-Yeah.

01:56:58.136 --> 01:56:59.006
All righty.

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:09.647
-Thank you.
-Great, thanks.

01:57:11.107 --> 01:57:13.687
Oh, actually, we're expecting someone.

01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:15.953
-I'll grab another menu.
-Okay.

01:58:27.183 --> 01:58:28.233
There.

01:58:30.061 --> 01:58:31.061
That's better.
