[Jefferson]<i> Previously</i>

00:02.470 --> 00:05.637
Don't make me rip
that mask off your face.
You say it.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.074
After all these years,
huh, man?

00:09.076 --> 00:11.210
[reporter]<i> According to</i>
<i> Reverend Jeremiah Holt,</i>

00:11.212 --> 00:13.979
<i> his church's Rebecca Lee</i>
<i> Crumpler Free Clinic</i>

00:13.981 --> 00:15.814
<i>is in danger of shutting down.</i>

00:15.816 --> 00:17.449
The clinic
is running out of time.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.085
If I don't help, then I'll
just be wasting the gifts
that God gave me.

00:20.087 --> 00:21.553
That's what your father
always used to say.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.560
God bless you, sister.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.162
I'm gonna set up a meeting

00:30.164 --> 00:34.500
so that you can convince
Dr. Jace to come on board.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.369
I'd like to include you
in a team working
to save the children.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.971
-The pod kids.
-Yes.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.873
Now, the purpose
of Black Lightning

00:40.875 --> 00:43.409
<i> was to kill Tobias,</i>
<i> who killed my father.</i>

00:43.411 --> 00:45.194
[groans]

00:45.195 --> 00:46.978
[Inspector Henderson]
<i> I wanted you</i>
<i> to hear it from me.</i>

00:46.981 --> 00:48.313
We caught Tobias.

00:48.949 --> 00:49.982
She needs help.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.450
She needs
a therapist to talk to.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.818
Can I help you?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.086
My name is Perenna.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.922
Where the hell are we?

00:56.924 --> 00:59.324
[Perenna] A place inside you
that will eventually allow you
to control your powers.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.960
Before you can stuff
your feelings into anything,

01:01.962 --> 01:04.530
we need to know
what those feelings are.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.199
[screaming]

-What do you guys think?
-[chuckling]

01:29.457 --> 01:32.691
-Baby, you look beautiful.
-Thank you, Mom.

01:32.693 --> 01:33.959
Gorgeous.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.227
All right, come on.
Get together.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.895
[Anissa] Yeah. Yeah, right.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.430
Got to love pictures.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.665
[laughs]

01:40.468 --> 01:42.935
Oh, come on, Dad.
You are old school.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.971
Hey. Not all cameras
are used for selfies now.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.340
[camera shutter clicks]

01:49.276 --> 01:52.144
-You really do look beautiful.
-Thanks.

[knocking on door]

02:08.863 --> 02:10.129
Really, J?

This dude?

[grunts]

02:19.540 --> 02:20.606
[gasps]

02:21.542 --> 02:24.376
J, we need to talk.

[Jennifer]<i> I can't stop it!</i>

03:15.796 --> 03:20.399
You can. You are the storm,
so you can control the storm.

03:20.401 --> 03:25.103
Don't fear it. Own it.
Pull the energy back into you.

03:26.607 --> 03:31.276
Take a minute, and know
that you are this power.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.712
Now...

03:33.714 --> 03:35.280
put it in the box.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.294
[gunshot]

03:50.631 --> 03:52.097
[monitor beeping]

03:52.099 --> 03:54.132
Hey, hang in there.
I'm right here.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.471
[breathing heavily]

04:01.775 --> 04:03.408
I can't. I tried.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.811
-I tried. I--
-I know.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.880
But you're making progress.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.150
[Jennifer sighs]

04:16.790 --> 04:18.890
Who is this Khalil?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.327
[sighs]

04:22.328 --> 04:23.894
<i> ¶ Last night</i>
<i> I saw a superhero</i>
<i> He was black ¶</i>

04:23.897 --> 04:27.199
<i> ¶ He said</i>
<i> "This is for the street</i>
<i> Black Lightning's back" ¶</i>

04:36.644 --> 04:39.878
I've been in here two days
and haven't changed
or nothin'.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.218
How is it
you never seem to age?

04:46.220 --> 04:48.220
[chuckles]
Well, a vegan lifestyle

04:48.222 --> 04:50.289
mixed with a little yoga
really does work.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.324
I keep saying black folks
got to get off of that

04:52.326 --> 04:55.527
fried chicken and watermelon
Kool-Aid diet.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.496
Plus, I do my best
to stay out of the sun.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.798
I'mma ask you a few questions.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.401
I know you gonna lie to me,

05:02.403 --> 05:03.502
but do you happen to know

05:03.504 --> 05:05.270
your whereabouts
last Thursday night?

05:05.272 --> 05:07.339
I'm pretty sure
that's domino night.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.741
Have you seen
Marsellus White recently?

05:09.743 --> 05:12.711
[scoffs]
Man, now you digging
in the crates.

05:12.713 --> 05:13.779
It's been years.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.747
How's that brother doing?

05:15.749 --> 05:20.218
Great. Up until the moment
somebody snapped his neck.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.487
Damn.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.291
All this violence
in Freeland...

05:27.428 --> 05:29.461
-is disturbing.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.164
Conveniently, all this
happened the very same week

05:32.166 --> 05:34.433
that the DNA evidence
in Alvin Pierce's murder

05:34.435 --> 05:36.168
went missing
from our evidence room

05:36.170 --> 05:38.470
and one of my cops
who had access

05:38.472 --> 05:41.540
to that evidence room
got himself set on fire.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.876
My condolences.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.244
I'm sure his kids
will be happy

05:46.246 --> 05:48.013
to know that you're concerned.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.281
[chuckles]

05:51.185 --> 05:56.054
You forgot something,
you translucent freak.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.290
You are not going to get away
with this.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.693
Deputy Chief Henderson.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.496
"Translucent."

06:04.498 --> 06:06.965
That's a very interesting
choice of words.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.702
It means
you can see right through me.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.003
And if you can see
right through me,

06:12.005 --> 06:13.939
then you know
what I'm thinking.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.311
[indistinct chatter]

06:20.914 --> 06:22.514
He orchestrated
this whole thing.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.182
He killed
his former lieutenant,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.917
he got rid
of our DNA evidence,

06:25.919 --> 06:26.985
got himself arrested

06:26.987 --> 06:28.353
knowing we would
have to let him go,

06:28.355 --> 06:30.756
all while rehabilitating
his reputation
with one stroke.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.557
Well, the judge
will call that a theory.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.393
I need hard evidence
of something.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.460
Murder, obstruction,

06:35.462 --> 06:37.362
conspiracy
to commit obstruction.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.698
Without that, we're gonna
have to let him walk.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.434
You got about 48 hours,
if that.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.104
As always, Ms. Montez,

06:46.106 --> 06:48.607
you're a regular ray
of sunshine.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.348
-[keyboard keys clacking]
-[beeping]

06:59.219 --> 07:01.119
She gave that money
to Reverend Holt?

07:01.121 --> 07:02.387
Yes.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.556
Who'd she steal it from?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.792
Mobsters from some
break-away republic.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.277
They were laundering money

07:08.278 --> 07:09.761
for that redevelopment
project downtown.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.062
And you knew about this?

07:11.732 --> 07:12.597
I did.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.699
But you didn't
come to me first?

07:14.701 --> 07:17.369
If I'd done that, I would have
lost Anissa's trust.

07:17.371 --> 07:18.670
I don't care about that.

07:18.672 --> 07:22.374
I do. Listen, Jeff,
Tobias is still out there,

07:22.376 --> 07:23.942
and he's got the briefcase.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.577
And some faction of the ASA

07:25.579 --> 07:27.446
is almost certainly
still hunting metas,

07:27.448 --> 07:29.214
which means that
you and the girls

07:29.216 --> 07:30.482
continue to be in danger.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.817
If I had let Anissa
go out there

07:31.819 --> 07:34.719
by herself that night,
she might be dead right now.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.055
And I wasn't about
to let that happen.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.291
I told her I was going
to tell you after the fact.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.892
I have.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.694
What you do now is up to you.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.931
[Jefferson]<i> Not only</i>
<i> was it illegal,</i>

07:45.933 --> 07:47.165
but you could've been hurt.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.167
Bullets literally
bounce off of me.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.769
Only if you're ready for 'em.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.004
And you think you saved
the clinic with that money?

07:53.006 --> 07:54.473
No, you just made it a target.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.241
Dad, Freeland
is already a target.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.943
This is way bigger
than a clinic.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.212
They have a reason
for buying all this property.

08:00.214 --> 08:01.546
And whatever that reason is,

08:01.548 --> 08:02.781
it means way worse things

08:02.783 --> 08:04.282
than the clinic
being a target.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.550
That's because
they're not just

08:05.552 --> 08:07.352
gangbangers on a corner,
Anissa.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.653
These are
professional criminals.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.422
Aren't we supposed
to be helping people?

08:10.424 --> 08:12.023
We are helping people.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.124
But unlike criminals,

08:13.126 --> 08:14.326
we have rules
that we need to follow.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.495
-Rules made by who?
-Rules made by me.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.763
Guess what? I have
a different set of rules.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.899
Because I'm not gonna
watch my people

08:20.901 --> 08:22.033
get taken advantage of.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.335
They are not
your people, Anissa.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.003
And as long as
you're under my roof,

08:25.005 --> 08:26.605
you will follow my rules.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.542
[scoffs] Wow.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.612
Okay. So you're going there?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.680
No, we're not going there.
We're already there.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.718
Okay.

08:40.954 --> 08:44.222
If you're gonna use this house
to try and tell me what to do,

08:44.224 --> 08:45.690
I'll make it easy for you.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.759
I'll be out of here
by morning.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.744
[voice trembles]
So you leaving
the rest for me, or what?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.648
Oh, come on, Jen.
Would you stop that?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.449
Or you gonna
get me crying, too.

09:11.818 --> 09:12.884
Come here.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.621
[Anissa sighs]

09:16.623 --> 09:20.825
Look, I'm not dying, okay?
I'll still be around.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.961
I just cannot have
Dad thinking

09:22.963 --> 09:24.963
he can control me.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.933
You act like he doesn't do
the same thing to me.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.201
You're 16. Your fast ass

09:30.203 --> 09:31.770
could use
a bit of controlling.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.838
Oh, I'm fast?
What are you, then?

09:33.840 --> 09:37.709
Grown. And what I do
is my own damn business.

09:37.711 --> 09:38.777
[chuckles]

09:47.287 --> 09:48.553
Anissa...

09:49.423 --> 09:50.956
I know I'm doing a lot,
but I don't know

09:50.958 --> 09:53.825
how I'm gonna get though
all this stuff without you.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.995
Really. I can't talk to Mom.
I can't talk to Dad.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.766
Listen.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.836
You know
I'm always here for you,

10:04.838 --> 10:05.670
right?

10:05.672 --> 10:07.472
[cell phone vibrating]

10:11.912 --> 10:12.978
Give me that.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.083
[sighs]

10:18.084 --> 10:20.285
Khalil? Have you lost
your damn mind? He killed Dad.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.519
Anissa, he killed
Black Lightning.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.154
Oh, so now you're
sticking up for him?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.389
When did he start texting you?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.925
A while ago. But I never
hit him back. I swear.

10:26.927 --> 10:27.792
Not once. I swear.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.761
Yo, you've gotta
shut this down.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.162
Now, I know
y'all used to be tight,

10:31.164 --> 10:32.530
but he is not who he was.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.000
You don't think I know that?
I know.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.268
Jennifer...

10:37.270 --> 10:39.070
whatever you are
going through...

10:40.774 --> 10:42.841
this boy is not the answer.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.975
I know.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.879
Here.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.016
And you better
stay away from him.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.518
Okay.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.288
Look, even if
I'm not in this house,

10:57.290 --> 10:59.090
I will always
be there for you.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.660
Come here, little girl.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.297
[sighs] I love you, girl.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.534
I love you.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.138
I think we've put
so much attention on Jennifer,

11:13.940 --> 11:15.473
we've forgotten
this is all new

11:15.475 --> 11:17.008
for Anissa as well.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.713
This path she's taking...

11:23.050 --> 11:24.182
Stealing.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.987
It only leads to blood--

11:28.989 --> 11:32.824
Hey, it's the same path
you took early on, remember?

11:33.960 --> 11:34.993
No, I never stole.

11:34.995 --> 11:38.029
Well, you may not have
stolen or killed,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.065
but how close to the edge
did you get?

12:06.293 --> 12:07.726
I'm sorry...

12:09.763 --> 12:12.163
that you have to
go through all this.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.204
That you had to
pull that trigger.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.776
It was
a live-or-die situation.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.212
I chose to live.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.217
I've come to terms with it.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.461
[cell phone vibrating]

12:43.463 --> 12:44.863
[Jefferson groans]

12:47.567 --> 12:49.067
[sighs]

12:54.674 --> 12:56.007
Mr. Pierce?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.345
[indistinct chatter]

13:04.451 --> 13:05.817
You're letting Tobias walk?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.586
First of all, I'm not
letting him do anything.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.255
Unlike Black Lightning,
I'm not a vigilante.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.791
I just can't go around
breaking the law.
I am the law.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.226
And secondly, where are you
getting your information from?

13:15.595 --> 13:17.228
I can't say.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.429
[scoffs] Of course you can't.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.731
Well, whoever pulled
your coattail

13:19.733 --> 13:22.534
should've told you
the evidence against him is...

13:22.536 --> 13:25.570
-It's all gone.
-Wait, what? But...

13:25.572 --> 13:28.072
the newspapers?
What about the DNA?

13:28.074 --> 13:29.874
What about the guy
he worked with?

13:29.876 --> 13:31.776
He was murdered last week.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.246
So he's just been playing you
the whole time?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.715
Right now, that's what
it looks like, yeah.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.284
No, no, there's gotta be
something else.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.386
And I'm confident he made
some sort of mistake,

13:41.388 --> 13:42.520
and I will find it.
But in the--

13:42.522 --> 13:43.955
Put me on the stand.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.293
Okay. Why? To say what?

13:48.295 --> 13:51.029
That I was there. That I saw
Tobias kill my father.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.897
You gonna
perjure yourself now?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.599
That's not how I roll.
You know that.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.068
I'm not lying. I was there.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.107
What?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.878
I was there.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.081
I saw Tobias murder my father.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.484
Gambi didn't let me
say anything

14:13.486 --> 14:16.120
because he thought it was
the best way to keep me safe.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.225
Damn, bro.
Any more lies or half-truths

14:20.227 --> 14:22.010
you want to clear up?

14:22.011 --> 14:23.794
Come on, man. Look, we gotta
squash this beef, all right?

14:23.797 --> 14:25.296
So that you and I
can work together

14:25.298 --> 14:27.115
and take down Tobias.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.933
You really don't understand
what position you've put me in

14:28.935 --> 14:31.269
as a deputy chief
or as a friend.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.778
I got work to do.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.766
[low rumbling]

15:10.377 --> 15:11.542
[Kara exhales]

15:13.513 --> 15:14.579
[Kara grunting]

15:14.581 --> 15:16.247
[monitor beeping]

15:23.189 --> 15:26.524
Please try not to move.
Nobody knows you're here.

15:29.829 --> 15:32.830
The straps are for
your own protection.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.399
I don't want
you to hurt yourself.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.802
Whatever it is
you were shot with,

15:37.804 --> 15:39.070
it went straight through.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.138
Tobias.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.507
With a harpoon.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.877
[groans]

15:49.716 --> 15:51.683
You've lost a lot of blood.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.185
You've gotta help me. Please.

15:54.187 --> 15:58.022
Kara, you need
to make your peace.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.558
No, there's
gotta be something.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.027
Kara, you've got sepsis.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.896
And it's only
going to get worse.

16:08.301 --> 16:15.073
You're trying to play me.
You lying old hypocrite.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.308
You ain't no better than I am.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.878
No, I'm not.
But I've had time to atone.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.081
You don't.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.049
At least tell me
what you know.

16:27.921 --> 16:31.255
I'm not telling you
a damn thing.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.898
I'm hoping
you might reconsider.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.270
This is for the pain.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.624
[indistinct shouting]

17:12.699 --> 17:13.965
[grunting]

17:17.437 --> 17:18.803
-Come on, man!
-Hey! Hey!

17:18.805 --> 17:20.905
Hey, hey, hey! No, no! Enough!

17:20.907 --> 17:22.273
Enough, both of you.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.942
Everybody, back to class.
Go. Go on.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.012
Go. Now, look, I don't know
what this all about,

17:28.014 --> 17:29.814
but at Garfield, we do not

17:29.816 --> 17:31.149
settle disputes
with our fists.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.817
-Yeah, no, but I--
-No, wait. No, no.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.053
No. "Hate is too great
a burden to bear.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.688
It injures the hater more
than it injures the hated."

17:37.690 --> 17:39.524
Who said that? Hmm?

17:41.294 --> 17:42.460
[sighs]

17:42.462 --> 17:45.997
-Coretta Scott King.
-That's right. That's right.

17:45.999 --> 17:49.300
Now, look each other
in the eye.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.436
In the eye.

17:51.438 --> 17:55.406
Shake hands
and squash this beef. Come on.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.644
-Yes.
-[Principal Lowry]
What's going on?

17:59.646 --> 18:00.945
I heard there was fighting.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.680
No, no, Principal Lowry,
I got it. Everything's okay.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.916
Had I wanted your opinion,
Mr. Pierce, I would've asked.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.217
Now, which one of you
threw the first punch?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.785
It doesn't matter.
These young men have--

18:07.787 --> 18:11.289
-Answer the question.
-His punk ass did.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.757
Hey, man, he was talking
all that mess, dog,

18:12.759 --> 18:13.791
and you know what?

18:13.793 --> 18:15.893
Calm... Calm down, okay?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.695
So it was you?
What's your name?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.298
[sighs] Sekou Hamilton.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.000
Congratulations, Mr. Hamilton,
you've just been expelled.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.168
What? Hey,
Mr. Pierce, what's--

18:24.170 --> 18:26.037
And you are suspended
for a week.

18:26.039 --> 18:29.207
What? Look, Principal Lowry,
these two are good kids.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.408
They just made a mistake.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.077
And this school
has a zero-tolerance policy

18:33.079 --> 18:34.145
when it comes to fighting.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.346
Now get back to class.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.949
No, this school was built
on the understanding

18:37.951 --> 18:39.650
that no one
is beyond redemption.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.319
Times change, Mr. Pierce.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.488
And if you feel you're unable
to properly enforce

18:43.490 --> 18:44.889
the school's
new rules and policies,

18:44.891 --> 18:46.991
well, you're free
to leave as well.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.459
Let's go.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.196
Expelled? Come on--

18:52.198 --> 18:53.831
Go back to class.
Everything's fine.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.734
Go back to class. It's fine.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.011
Don't you ever
talk to me like that.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.813
Not here or anywhere else.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.615
Are you threatening me,
Mr. Pierce?

19:10.617 --> 19:12.450
Oh, for the record, yes.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.284
As I've said,
if you don't like my methods

19:14.287 --> 19:16.687
or find you're
unable to support them,

19:16.689 --> 19:17.788
feel free to go.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.858
No... To hell with that.
Let's be clear.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.361
I am only here
to give you cover,

19:23.363 --> 19:26.330
to give your presence
at Garfield legitimacy.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.133
So we both know
I'm not going anywhere.

19:29.135 --> 19:32.036
No, no. You're here to give
cover to the board, not me.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.237
Now, I understand

19:33.239 --> 19:35.506
why they need their
Black Jesus, but I don't.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.242
Because no child
will be shot, kidnapped,

19:38.244 --> 19:41.412
or overdose on Green Light
on my watch, period.

19:43.483 --> 19:47.818
Look, if you give
that kid another chance,

19:47.820 --> 19:51.155
he will become a person
that we can all be proud of.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.557
But you throw him out
on the street,

19:52.559 --> 19:55.760
odds are, he's gonna become
someone to be feared.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.133
Zero tolerance.

20:02.135 --> 20:05.169
The rule offers no room
for interpretation,

20:05.171 --> 20:08.539
which is why it will be easy
for all of us to understand.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.711
Yeah.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.187
[bell dings]

20:32.632 --> 20:33.764
[sighs]

20:35.168 --> 20:37.568
I take it it didn't go so well
with your father.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.470
[scoffs]

20:39.472 --> 20:41.973
You mind if I crash
for a few days?

20:41.975 --> 20:44.842
Of course.
You're always welcome.

20:44.844 --> 20:45.977
You stay as long as you like.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.645
Thank you, Uncle Gambi.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.181
But I'm gonna have to let
your parents know you're here.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.918
[sighs] I know.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.587
Come on,
let's get you settled in.

21:00.393 --> 21:07.164
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.603
That's odd.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.871
[beeps]

21:15.174 --> 21:17.108
Are you expecting
something to happen?

21:17.110 --> 21:18.809
-[alarm blaring]
-Yes.

21:21.281 --> 21:26.050
No. No, no, no, no.
This is not right.

21:26.052 --> 21:30.621
This... What's happening?
What's happening?

21:36.896 --> 21:39.363
Guess we know
what his powers were.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.731
If you knew
he was gonna wake up,

21:40.733 --> 21:41.966
why didn't you say something?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.201
-We could've saved him.
-We couldn't.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.503
The subject was experiencing

21:45.505 --> 21:47.672
rapid mitochondrial
deterioration.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.641
-Death was imminent.
-No! He's not a subject!

21:50.643 --> 21:52.777
He's a person,
and his name is Sean Phillips.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.378
And now he's dead.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.381
Indeed. And now
we have more data.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.883
I'll input this.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.584
No.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.458
[indistinct talking on TV]

22:13.032 --> 22:14.365
Hey, sweetheart.

22:17.270 --> 22:18.869
[Jefferson exhales deeply]

22:24.377 --> 22:26.243
So how'd it go yesterday?

22:37.090 --> 22:38.489
[sighs]

22:40.259 --> 22:42.226
I see you're ignoring me.

22:45.064 --> 22:47.164
-Wonderful.
-[TV turns off]

22:47.166 --> 22:48.666
You know, I didn't think
there was anything else

22:48.668 --> 22:51.569
you could take away from me,
and then you threw Anissa out.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.738
I did not throw her out.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.606
I confronted her.

22:56.275 --> 22:57.341
She made a choice.

22:57.343 --> 22:59.110
You know what, Dad? I get it.

22:59.112 --> 23:01.579
It's cool. You never
make any mistakes, right?

23:01.581 --> 23:02.646
You're perfect.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.282
Uh...

23:11.958 --> 23:13.858
[chains clinking]

23:13.860 --> 23:15.693
[guard] All right, Tobias.
Here's your lawyer.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.273
How about a little music?

23:35.148 --> 23:36.547
[jazz playing
over headphones]

23:38.584 --> 23:40.217
If you want, I can make
a couple calls,

23:40.219 --> 23:41.585
have you home by dinner.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.521
[chuckles]

23:43.523 --> 23:45.156
It never ceases to amaze me

23:45.158 --> 23:46.357
how all you white folks

23:46.359 --> 23:48.192
feel this need
to be the savior.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.127
Makes me want to laugh
and at the same time,

23:50.129 --> 23:51.595
punch you in the face.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.064
Now, before my smile fades,

23:54.066 --> 23:55.800
how about you tell me
why you're here.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.569
[sighs]

23:58.571 --> 24:03.674
A, uh... [exhales]
significant sum of money
was stolen

24:03.676 --> 24:05.976
from us by
some bitch with powers.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.579
Ah, so that's how
the free clinic

24:08.581 --> 24:10.581
got its miraculous donation.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.349
Mmm.

24:12.351 --> 24:14.919
Out of respect,
we've come to you.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.054
Before we spill blood
on the streets of Freeland,

24:17.056 --> 24:18.689
your streets...

24:18.691 --> 24:20.558
we're here
to ask for permission.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.093
You want to kill her?

24:23.095 --> 24:25.496
We have ideas
on how to make our point.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.165
[sighs]

24:28.167 --> 24:30.634
Permission granted,
under one condition.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.970
I want facial and body
recognition monitors

24:32.972 --> 24:34.138
set up outside the clinic,

24:34.140 --> 24:37.174
just in case
Black Lightning shows up.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.376
He's been walking
around Freeland every day,

24:39.378 --> 24:41.312
and no one knows
who his black ass is.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.813
But I'm going to burn
this city down

24:42.815 --> 24:45.249
and everyone in it
until I find him.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.918
He's taken everything from me.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.989
Tori, Joey Toledo, Syonide.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.359
He's got to die.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.995
And he's got to die soon.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.431
We're on the same page.

25:09.475 --> 25:10.741
[laptop chimes]

25:12.645 --> 25:13.711
[scoffs]

25:23.890 --> 25:24.955
[gasps]

25:30.196 --> 25:31.495
[groans in frustration]

25:35.001 --> 25:36.734
[footsteps approaching]

25:44.343 --> 25:45.376
[Lynn sighs]

25:45.378 --> 25:46.644
You okay?

25:48.214 --> 25:49.813
I lost another kid.

25:54.487 --> 25:55.953
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.722
Yeah.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.961
Did Jennifer tell you
that she fried another laptop?

26:03.963 --> 26:06.063
What? [Jefferson sighs]

26:06.065 --> 26:08.365
That girl
is costing me a fortune.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.833
I thought she was
making progress.

26:09.835 --> 26:12.002
She is. But this is why
I don't feel like

26:12.004 --> 26:13.771
she's ready to go back
to school, you know?

26:13.773 --> 26:15.372
I mean, it only
takes one mistake.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.907
Yeah, true.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.344
Uh. Besides, I wouldn't
want her there.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.513
Garfield is not
Garfield right now.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.615
-Lowry?
-Mmm.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.450
Yes, Lowry.

26:26.452 --> 26:29.486
You know what?
I want to take my school back.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.221
I mean, this guy, he's...

26:31.223 --> 26:32.289
He's just a pencil pusher

26:32.291 --> 26:33.357
trying to get
to another raise.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.959
He doesn't care
about the kids.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.493
So, then, take it back.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.462
If there's one thing I know
about Jefferson Pierce,

26:38.464 --> 26:39.830
when he puts
his mind to something,

26:39.832 --> 26:41.098
there aren't enough Lowrys
in the world

26:41.100 --> 26:42.866
that can stop him.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.835
Everything happens
for a reason.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.404
My father
would have loved you.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.707
[chuckles] Good taste.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.709
-Great taste.
-[laughs]

26:52.979 --> 26:54.144
[both laughing]

26:57.049 --> 26:58.148
Oh, hey, sweetheart.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.018
Hey.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.120
You mind if I
have a second with Dad?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.254
Yeah.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.723
Just...

27:05.725 --> 27:08.892
Just remember you were sad
when she left yesterday.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.903
It's good to see you.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.807
Look, Dad, Gambi thinks
the free clinic's in trouble

27:23.809 --> 27:25.943
and that someone's
gonna attack it.

27:25.945 --> 27:29.546
Just go ahead and say,
"I you told you so."

27:29.548 --> 27:31.515
-I know you're dying to.
-No.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.951
I wish I weren't right.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.521
Dad, I think I need your help.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.823
Well, I'm here to do
what needs to be done.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.294
And I accept your apology.

27:44.296 --> 27:48.699
[chuckles] Well, that's...
That's funny,
because I didn't give one.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.968
But I'll definitely
take yours.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.303
Yep. Let's go.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.741
All right,
Henderson's up to speed.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.777
But since there's
no definite time or threat,

27:59.779 --> 28:01.078
he couldn't get
the clinic to shut down.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.414
All they'll do is beef up
security for a week or so.

28:03.416 --> 28:04.748
Okay, so what should we do?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.950
Though there are no known
photos of Vladislav Zlovac,

28:06.952 --> 28:09.553
the guy in charge of this
redevelopment project.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.722
He just transferred $50,000

28:11.724 --> 28:13.557
from one of his
business accounts.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.292
-To who?
-Don't know.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.860
After being rerouted
several times,

28:16.862 --> 28:18.796
I traced it to
a company in Chicago.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.597
But it turns out,
other than a bank account

28:20.599 --> 28:21.765
and a digital profile,

28:21.767 --> 28:24.501
the company
doesn't even exist.

28:24.503 --> 28:25.903
Chatter on the
Dark Web tells me

28:25.905 --> 28:27.871
that the money was for
some sort of hired gun.

28:27.873 --> 28:31.975
Now, the clinic
only has two
points of entry...

28:31.977 --> 28:33.744
-[Anissa clears throat]
-The front door on the street

28:33.746 --> 28:36.180
and this service door
off the alley.

28:36.182 --> 28:38.515
And Henderson says he'll limit
traffic on both sides.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.550
Okay.

28:39.552 --> 28:40.951
Now, based on
what I'm hearing,

28:40.953 --> 28:42.086
and knowing that
they're gonna want to

28:42.088 --> 28:44.688
inflict the maximum amount
of damage,

28:44.690 --> 28:45.789
an explosive device

28:45.791 --> 28:47.191
seems the most likely
method of attack.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.827
So if they can't deliver
a blast by car or truck,

28:49.829 --> 28:51.095
well, that just leaves us--

28:51.097 --> 28:53.664
With every person who may
walk through that door.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.758
Took long enough for
Popsicle Boy here to thaw out.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.562
I need you to run some sims
on a new chemical chain.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.064
I reverse engineered
the ones you used--

29:27.066 --> 29:30.534
Why would you do that?
Those calculations were off.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.002
Yeah, but only by ten seconds.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.737
Eight.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.973
Look, I've run this simulation
several times,

29:35.975 --> 29:38.275
taking into account both
corrosion and energy storage,

29:38.277 --> 29:40.744
and even with
the added ten seconds
it doesn't add up.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.413
It was eight.

29:42.414 --> 29:43.547
And what you're doing
isn't working

29:43.549 --> 29:45.482
because you're trying
to predict improvement

29:45.484 --> 29:47.417
and I designed it
to predict failure.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.420
-Yeah, okay--
-I told you, Dr. Stewart,

29:50.422 --> 29:51.655
they're all gonna die.

29:51.657 --> 29:54.725
It's only a matter
of how quickly.

29:54.727 --> 29:57.861
-I refuse to accept that.
-I know.

29:57.863 --> 30:00.764
I know.
Your optimism amuses me.

30:00.766 --> 30:03.267
But death catches
us all, Dr. Stewart.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.935
None of us gets out alive.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.138
I'm here because
I'm one of three people
in the world

30:08.140 --> 30:09.973
who can do what I do.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.876
And the other two
aren't nearly as nice.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.679
Oh, by the way,
I came across some samples

30:15.681 --> 30:17.714
of stable metahuman DNA.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.750
Do you know
where these samples came from?

30:21.887 --> 30:24.087
Uh, the ASA acquired them.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.857
One is a vaccine subject
that is actually stable.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.827
The other two show no sign
of the vaccine or Green Light.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.695
Had you noticed
that both samples

30:31.697 --> 30:34.131
have the exact same
set of protein markers,

30:34.133 --> 30:38.202
each sequencing
at a previously
uncategorized fashion?

30:38.204 --> 30:39.670
They'd have to be related.

30:39.672 --> 30:42.806
It's Genetics 101, right?

30:42.808 --> 30:46.043
What if the metagene
could be inherited?

30:46.545 --> 30:48.111
Let's stay focused, okay?

30:48.113 --> 30:50.347
Uh, run the simulation
on the chemical chain

30:50.349 --> 30:52.816
and see if it doesn't lead
to a serum of some sort.

30:52.818 --> 30:56.453
Just imagine an entire family
of metas, though.

30:56.455 --> 31:00.023
Once the ASA found them,
we'd be able to poke, prod,

31:00.025 --> 31:03.327
and scrutinize every detail
of their genetic makeup.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.330
Now, that would be excellent.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.434
[sirens wailing]

31:17.676 --> 31:19.109
[Gambi]
<i> The Dark Web's gone quiet.</i>

31:19.111 --> 31:21.778
And when people stop talking,
it usually means one thing.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.180
That they're ready.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.283
Well, we just
have to be careful,

31:26.285 --> 31:29.119
stay on our toes.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.954
These guys don't play by
the same rules that we do.

31:31.957 --> 31:35.692
[scoffs] You just couldn't
help yourself, could you?

31:35.694 --> 31:37.561
Look, I'm just saying,

31:37.563 --> 31:38.629
if we don't have a code,

31:38.631 --> 31:39.663
we're no better
than the criminals.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.465
We'll always
be better than them.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.935
We're fighting for the people,
for Freeland, not for money

31:44.937 --> 31:47.137
or trying to make
some young girl a sex slave.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.239
If we aren't using our powers
to help people,

31:49.241 --> 31:51.241
then what good are they?

31:51.243 --> 31:53.543
You had to steal
to help those people?

31:53.545 --> 31:54.845
I don't consider

31:54.847 --> 31:56.647
taking money back from people
like that stealing.

31:56.649 --> 32:00.083
I consider doing it...
Hang on.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.885
You see this guy
by the dumpster?

32:01.887 --> 32:03.253
[Black Lightning]
<i> Oh, Gambi, you seeing this?</i>

32:08.093 --> 32:10.394
Just a guy
trying to kill hunger pains.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.332
So your mother
and I were wondering...

32:16.602 --> 32:18.869
if you want your own place...

32:19.972 --> 32:23.974
maybe you'd want to move
into my father's old house.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.012
<i> Wait a second.</i>
<i> Wasn't that woman</i>

32:29.014 --> 32:30.347
<i> pregnant a few minutes ago?</i>

32:35.587 --> 32:36.687
[Gambi] It's the same woman.

32:36.689 --> 32:38.088
Whatever she gave birth to
ain't good.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.490
You guys better get in there.
I'll take care of her.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.377
[both grunting]

33:03.182 --> 33:04.414
[car horn blares]

33:10.456 --> 33:12.556
Guys, I need everybody
out of here. Let's go.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.657
Everybody out. Come on.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.292
We gotta get out here.
We gotta get out.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.432
Guys, I need
everybody out of here.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.667
Go, guys, we need to be safe.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.335
Get out here. Let's go.
We gotta get out.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.371
Come on, we're not
moving fast enough. Let's go!

33:28.407 --> 33:29.539
You, out.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.647
Got a bomb.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.485
[bomb beeping]

33:50.963 --> 33:52.996
-[bomb beeping]
-I've got one in here, too.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.400
[grunts]

34:04.810 --> 34:06.109
[both grunting]

34:24.963 --> 34:26.063
[tires screeching]

34:26.065 --> 34:28.532
What's going on here?
Are you okay?

34:28.534 --> 34:29.633
[grunting]

34:50.923 --> 34:51.988
So I saw in the file

34:51.990 --> 34:53.890
that you were interviewed
as a child,

34:53.892 --> 34:56.593
but there's no mention
of you being there.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.563
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

34:59.565 --> 35:01.331
-Wait a minute--
-I mean, it doesn't
really matter.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.167
Once the defense asks
the question, which he will,

35:04.169 --> 35:07.070
the jury won't believe
anything that you say.

35:07.072 --> 35:09.473
I've lived my whole life
in Freeland.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.008
My word usually means
something around here.

35:12.010 --> 35:13.577
I'm sure it does.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.746
But let's say that I actually
allowed you on the stand.

35:16.748 --> 35:19.749
The defense cross-examination
would go something like,

35:19.751 --> 35:21.985
"Mr. Pierce,
have you ever lied

35:21.987 --> 35:24.588
to investigators
regarding this case?"

35:26.825 --> 35:28.058
Yes, but--

35:28.060 --> 35:30.160
"So, besides your word,
do you have any proof

35:30.162 --> 35:31.228
that you were a witness

35:31.230 --> 35:34.064
to this alleged crime
by my client?"

35:34.433 --> 35:36.416
No, but I--

35:36.417 --> 35:38.400
"Mr. Pierce, did you
love your father?"

35:38.403 --> 35:39.853
Of course.

35:39.854 --> 35:41.304
"Would you say that you
would do anything for him?"

35:41.306 --> 35:42.405
Now, of course, at this point,

35:42.407 --> 35:44.174
I would object
to leading the witness.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.076
The defense would
withdraw his question

35:46.078 --> 35:48.044
and ask some version of,

35:48.046 --> 35:51.515
"Do you think my client
being released from custody

35:51.517 --> 35:54.017
after decades
of being wrongly accused

35:54.019 --> 35:56.686
has anything to do
with you coming forward now?"

35:56.688 --> 35:58.655
"Wrongly accused"?

35:58.657 --> 36:01.958
Tobias Whale has gotten
away with this for 30 years,

36:01.960 --> 36:04.060
while my father
has rotted in his grave.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.429
"No further questions,
Your Honor."

36:08.667 --> 36:09.733
Oh.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.869
Mr. Pierce,
I believe you. I do.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.105
But right now,
the truth does not help us.

36:15.107 --> 36:19.376
The only thing that helps us
make a case is proof.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.150
So there's nothing, then?

36:27.152 --> 36:30.954
Nothing to prove
that I was actually there?

36:30.956 --> 36:32.489
I destroyed anything
that could have

36:32.491 --> 36:35.225
even remotely linked you
to that crime scene.

36:35.227 --> 36:38.128
I did whatever I could
to protect you.

36:41.166 --> 36:47.470
So Tobias is gonna be free
to walk the streets?

36:50.242 --> 36:51.808
I can't accept that.

36:55.380 --> 36:58.281
If you hurt Tobias after they
drop the charges against him,

36:58.283 --> 37:00.617
then you're
the bad guy, not him.

37:01.119 --> 37:02.586
[Jefferson sighs]

37:02.588 --> 37:07.190
We will find something, Jeff.
We will. I won't ever give up.

37:09.995 --> 37:12.963
-Jennifer!
-Yeah.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.698
Could you
come down here, please?

37:15.968 --> 37:17.534
Do you think
we're overreacting?

37:17.536 --> 37:21.338
No. No, we were leaning
in this direction already.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.907
I mean, yes, I thought
she was improving.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.141
But then, after the laptop,

37:25.143 --> 37:26.710
now this thing
with Dr. Jace...

37:26.712 --> 37:28.228
Oh, she's gonna be mad.

37:28.229 --> 37:29.745
And you know what?
I can't say I blame her.

37:33.118 --> 37:34.384
Hey, what's up?

37:35.387 --> 37:37.120
Sweetheart, there is something

37:37.122 --> 37:39.489
we need to
talk through with you.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.660
Your mother and I have decided

37:43.662 --> 37:46.596
it's not safe for you
to go back to Garfield.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.765
What?

37:50.068 --> 37:51.668
We're gonna homeschool you.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.639
No, Dad...

37:56.375 --> 37:57.540
Wait, I don't understand.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.609
I've done everything
you guys asked me to do.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.678
Yes, you have.

38:01.679 --> 38:03.746
But you still can't
control your powers.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.215
I mean, not yet.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.682
And there are people out there
looking for metas.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.118
The police. The government.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.186
Even my work helping to save
the pod children

38:10.188 --> 38:11.221
is a threat to you.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.256
-This isn't fair.
-We're sorry.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.392
Yeah, we are really sorry.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.793
I can't believe
after everything you guys

38:16.795 --> 38:18.361
have put me through, that...

38:19.631 --> 38:20.697
[Jennifer sighs]

38:21.900 --> 38:23.166
Wow.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.672
[Lynn sighs]

38:31.710 --> 38:33.243
[monitor beeping]

38:40.218 --> 38:41.484
[Kara grunting]

38:52.130 --> 38:57.334
[breathing heavily]
I really am dying, aren't I?

38:57.969 --> 38:59.602
I'm afraid so.

39:00.472 --> 39:06.242
I swear I didn't know
Proctor was bent.

39:06.244 --> 39:09.279
I was just trying
to serve my country.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.151
You still can.

39:15.153 --> 39:18.655
Help me. I need to find
Proctor's case.

39:18.657 --> 39:20.790
Is it as powerful
as I think it is?

39:24.563 --> 39:25.695
Burn me.

39:27.199 --> 39:28.865
Don't put me in the ground.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.235
Burn my body.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.974
I will. I promise.

39:41.646 --> 39:42.846
Tobias...

39:44.349 --> 39:46.549
Tobias has the case?

39:46.551 --> 39:50.553
Does he know how to use it?
Kara, where can I find him?

39:58.230 --> 40:00.296
-[exhales]
-[monitor flatlining]

40:06.304 --> 40:07.637
[reporters clamoring]

40:07.639 --> 40:09.539
Tobias, how's it feel
to be exonerated?

40:09.541 --> 40:11.975
Oh, I've always had
a strong belief

40:11.977 --> 40:13.376
in our justice system.

40:13.378 --> 40:15.512
And knowing
I've been wrongly accused
all these years,

40:15.514 --> 40:18.314
to see that system
work firsthand,

40:18.316 --> 40:20.517
[exhales] only solidified
my belief.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.385
So what's next
for Tobias Whale?

40:22.387 --> 40:24.087
Well, much more than anything,

40:24.089 --> 40:25.121
I want to once again become

40:25.123 --> 40:26.589
an active member in society

40:26.591 --> 40:29.659
and, most importantly,
a pillar of this community.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.696
And let me just say this.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.597
<i> I can only hope and offer</i>
<i> up my prayers that, one day,</i>

40:34.599 --> 40:37.300
<i> after 30 years,</i>
<i> they finally find the person</i>

40:37.302 --> 40:39.102
<i> who really killed</i>
<i> Alvin Pierce.</i>

40:39.104 --> 40:40.970
<i> If for no other reason</i>
<i> than to allow</i>

40:40.972 --> 40:42.505
<i> Jefferson Pierce</i>
<i> and his family</i>

40:42.507 --> 40:44.741
<i> to finally find peace.</i>

40:44.743 --> 40:46.709
<i> Now if you'll kindly</i>
<i> excuse me...</i>

40:46.711 --> 40:47.977
[reporter]
<i> Thank you for your time.</i>

40:48.914 --> 40:50.380
[electricity crackling]

41:13.605 --> 41:14.671
Hey.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.908
I didn't expect
you to text me back.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.511
Yeah, well...

41:32.290 --> 41:33.923
[indistinct chatter]

41:39.064 --> 41:40.330
I'm back.

41:40.332 --> 41:44.267
[crowd chanting]
Yeah! One Hundred!
One Hundred!

41:44.269 --> 41:46.836
One Hundred! One Hundred!

41:46.838 --> 41:50.673
One Hundred! One Hundred!
One Hundred!

41:52.477 --> 41:54.744
[closing theme music playing]
