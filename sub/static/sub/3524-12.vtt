01:38.331 --> 01:40.128
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:41.167 --> 01:45.570
Corrado Soprano is not
some harmless old man...

01:46.272 --> 01:48.740
being persecuted by the government...

01:48.908 --> 01:53.174
but a ruthless and calculating mob boss...

01:53.246 --> 01:56.579
who controls a vast criminal enterprise.

01:57.383 --> 02:01.717
Over the past few months,
you've heard from FBI agents...

02:02.188 --> 02:07.057
who have documented
clandestine meetings at his doctor's offices.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.987
Tales of bid rigging, sweetheart deals...

02:11.598 --> 02:14.999
secret payoffs, and even murder.

02:15.935 --> 02:20.929
No, Corrado Soprano
is not some harmless old man...

02:21.641 --> 02:24.633
but a killer who orders up murder...

02:24.944 --> 02:27.344
like you and I order up coffee.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.019
All right. So, I rewrote it.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.155
<i>"The entire point of Melville's Bily Budd...</i>

02:46.299 --> 02:49.996
"it seems to me, is to show
how mean humans can be to each other.

02:50.069 --> 02:52.435
"Especially when living
in cramped conditions. "

02:52.505 --> 02:54.097
Hold that thought.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.477
Come on in.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.856
So, how is your mother's
apartment coming?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.085
Artie's Uncle Zio finished the framing...

03:13.159 --> 03:15.889
but now the Sheetrock,
it's wet on the bottom.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.055
There's a leak, maybe in the foundation.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.031
My father is a contractor.

03:20.099 --> 03:24.263
If you want, I can have him take a look at it.
He is free, I think, tomorrow afternoon.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.464
That would be a huge relief.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.399
<i>What smells in this house?
Marone, it's like the smell of heaven.</i>

03:31.477 --> 03:33.968
Homemade scones. My son loves them.

03:35.014 --> 03:37.642
Here, try one. They are just out of the oven.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.207
Thank you, no.

03:40.186 --> 03:43.121
That's all there is for breakfast,
is fat and carbs?

03:44.123 --> 03:46.489
Excuse me, we have a guest.
You want to say hello?

03:46.559 --> 03:47.719
Anyway.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.830
"When Mr. Claggart gets mad at Billy,
it is a surprise...

03:52.999 --> 03:56.059
"because he is always saying
how handsome Billy is.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.069
"This does not seem realistic...

03:58.137 --> 04:01.903
"because why would an officer care
if a sailor was handsome or not?"

04:18.291 --> 04:21.658
A.J., your father's leaving.
I'll come up in a minute. Go over it.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.134
What is this?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.603
"Ocean Club at Paradise Island. "

04:33.906 --> 04:36.773
We leave tomorrow for three beautiful days.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.505
Tomorrow?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.172
I know it's short notice,
but the deal came through.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.376
We got a view suite, first-class plane tickets.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.516
Guy owes me a favor.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.286
- What?
- I don't know...

04:54.093 --> 04:57.722
- A.J.? School?
- He's old enough to spoil himself now.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.489
You were jealous when I left for Florida...

05:00.566 --> 05:04.297
My mother with the skin condition.
Just the time it's gonna take to pack.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.598
To pack.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.733
I'll wait outside.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.002
With all the shit that's been going on,
the horse and all...

05:14.080 --> 05:17.049
Now, I know you need a break. Deep down...

05:18.584 --> 05:21.382
that's probably the reason
you got your hair cut.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.249
<i>You believe that in there? The tickets?</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:27.987
For two years,
she's complained that we never get away.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.689
So I make it happen.
Top shelf across the board.

05:30.763 --> 05:35.257
All of a sudden, her mother's psoriasis
is like the bubonic fucking plague.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.432
<i>You know what, va fungule.
I don't know why I bother.</i>

05:40.106 --> 05:43.166
- She's probably worried for her mother.
- Fuck that.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.472
They got her on the cortisone.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.814
I know she's my wife
and the mother of my children and all...

05:49.882 --> 05:53.340
but let me tell you something,
she can be a moody bitch.

05:59.058 --> 06:02.619
There he is. Live from Miami Beach.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.058
- Where's your pop?
- Clubhouse.

06:09.135 --> 06:10.966
Forgot to put his Desenex.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.169
- This shit with Tony?
- Total debacle.

06:21.781 --> 06:24.682
<i>And Pop with his testa dura,
he's not doing anybody any good.</i>

06:24.751 --> 06:27.242
Anything you could do
to change your father's mind?

06:27.320 --> 06:30.153
I'm gonna try, John.
I came all the way up here for that.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.884
You put your sun block on?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.898
As you know, Dad,
Tony Soprano came to visit me recently.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.631
I bought him dinner, we talked.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.036
I'm not sure I like that he did that end run.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.974
He's an old-fashioned guy, Pop.
Very allegorical.

06:51.043 --> 06:54.103
I don't think it was his intention
to insult anybody.

06:55.481 --> 06:58.382
You're distracting me. I'm taking a mulligan.

06:59.318 --> 07:03.755
The problem is, I'm afraid that you backed
yourself into a corner, this HUD thing.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.622
Your insistence on the 40 percent.

07:06.692 --> 07:10.389
Remember, even from the beginning
I felt 40 was a tad steep.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.863
A real hardhead, this Soprano kid.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.299
And the ego.

07:16.002 --> 07:19.733
I tell you, though, when I first met him,
decisive as he is...

07:20.506 --> 07:23.441
I would've been proud
to call him my own son.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.474
Maybe there's a compromise here, then.

07:29.682 --> 07:31.809
There's always a compromise.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.511
He's a bit of a poseur, if you ask me.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.818
Tony. He likes to talk the talk, I don't know.

07:40.893 --> 07:44.226
- What did he say?
- His turf, his appraiser.

07:44.430 --> 07:45.988
Son of a bitch.

07:46.065 --> 07:49.501
- What, did they resod that green?
- No, you got to give him some slack.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.732
He hasn't really been boss of a family
very long.

07:53.239 --> 07:56.731
Family? I told you, they're a glorified crew.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.840
Whatever they are, Carmine,
the Sopranos bring in a lot of cash.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.247
I've been close with Tony for a lot of years.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.809
On reflection, John,
maybe that's the sticking post.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.720
Tony feels like you're friends
and not business associates.

08:10.790 --> 08:14.920
See, what am I always saying?
I hate this fucking shit.

08:25.371 --> 08:29.603
It's a small space, but I guess
that makes it a decorating challenge.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.803
The man in the store says to put mirrors...

08:32.879 --> 08:36.645
but Mama thinks it's nose-in-the-air
when people look at themselves.

08:38.116 --> 08:42.520
How about, let's see, something like this?

08:44.090 --> 08:47.526
That's beautiful.
She'll fall in love with that place.

08:47.593 --> 08:51.085
It's so cozy with the pillows... Romantic.

08:52.231 --> 08:53.994
Not that your mother...

08:58.304 --> 09:00.568
I never thanked you for helping me.

09:01.407 --> 09:02.806
That's okay.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.377
You're a very special woman.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.975
Have you thought about flooring yet?

09:14.921 --> 09:16.047
Not really, no.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.754
Speak English, for Christ's sake.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.818
If she doesn't go for mirrors...

09:23.896 --> 09:27.093
we should pick
a light-colored ceramic tile maybe.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.264
All the houses back home have tile floors.

09:30.436 --> 09:34.099
Then we should go to Colortile.
They have everything.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.973
- I would love to go with you there.
- Great, then it's a date.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.608
Good. It's a date.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.315
The handicaps are all taken.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.654
What beautiful affairs they were,
those Knights of Columbus dinners.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.058
Julius La Rosa would sing
with that voice of his.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.493
Top dollar, they paid.

09:57.563 --> 09:59.861
Now, that's a nice-looking man.

10:07.373 --> 10:10.171
There's a handicap by the door.
Quick, Minn.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.676
I remember him
from Arthur Godfrey's program.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.770
He was so mean to him, that man.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.716
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

10:19.785 --> 10:23.186
I'm bleeding. Oh, my god.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.824
Jesus Christ, lady, didn't you see me?

10:33.332 --> 10:35.266
Guy checks into one of the guest rooms...

10:35.334 --> 10:37.666
calls down and says,
"I got a leak in the sink. "

10:37.737 --> 10:40.570
I said, "Go ahead,
the customer's always right. "

10:42.742 --> 10:44.505
Any results from Little Carmine yet?

10:44.577 --> 10:47.478
Johnny Sack wants a sit-down
tomorrow night.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.772
Sweetheart, another drink.

10:52.184 --> 10:55.483
What do you say, Ton'?
Maybe we should take off soon?

10:56.022 --> 10:58.456
What's your hurry? Hang out awhile.

10:58.691 --> 11:02.183
- Stay, I'll get you home.
- No, we should go.

11:02.428 --> 11:05.727
All right, you two want to go?
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.891
Come on, I'll walk you out.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.129
Perfect.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.269
Got my drink, a little dancing...

11:23.482 --> 11:25.245
You want to go upstairs?

11:27.920 --> 11:29.080
That's okay.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.859
<i>Paulie, Marone.</i>

11:43.969 --> 11:47.234
For Pete's sake, Nucci,
you were fine for the last two hours.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.739
All right, let me see.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.606
She's just a little shaken up.
We gave her some Tylenol.

11:51.677 --> 11:55.408
It was such a crash, though.
Cookie's in the x-ray with three stitches.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.881
When was the last time
you had your eyes examined?

11:57.950 --> 12:00.851
- My eyesight is fine.
- Listen to the doc.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.718
You shouldn't be behind the wheel
at your age.

12:03.789 --> 12:08.283
- I've been driving since I was a young girl.
- Horse and buggies don't count.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.022
- Paulie, be nice.
- Relax, Ma.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.857
She ain't driving you no more.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.924
Maybe if your mother
wasn't talking in my ear.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.268
We were all chatting.

12:18.337 --> 12:21.238
Everyone in the neighborhood
says you're moving into the home.

12:21.307 --> 12:24.674
- What do you need a car for?
- I like my independence.

12:24.744 --> 12:29.010
- And it's none of your goddamn business.
- This is my Ma we're talking about.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.515
<i>But we have tickets to The Producers.</i>

12:31.951 --> 12:34.852
Don't worry about it. I'll drive you girls.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.517
Hello?

12:41.827 --> 12:42.816
Colin, hi.

12:43.028 --> 12:45.861
Hey, Mrs. Soprano.
Meadow's on campus, she'll be right back.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.565
- I'm Ellen McDermott, Colin's mother.
- Hi.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.467
I'm gonna get my shoes.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.063
You've seen the apartment before?

12:55.141 --> 12:58.406
I teach school out in Akron
and I couldn't get here till now.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.537
We figured she's only a sophomore,
why does she need an apartment?

13:01.614 --> 13:05.175
But with those seniors moving out midterm,
we said a Hail Mary.

13:05.251 --> 13:09.517
No, I have to tell you.
Your daughter is really something.

13:09.588 --> 13:13.149
- His old roommate...
- Thank you. Colin is very sweet also.

13:13.826 --> 13:17.318
Thank you. But she's going places, that girl.

13:17.763 --> 13:22.291
Poised, mature. Cooks for these other two.
Plus she volunteers at that law center.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.599
I think that's extraordinary. Congratulations.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.862
Speak of the devil.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.843
- Mom, remember Alex?
- Of course, hi.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.141
Excuse me.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.547
- The place is really shaping up.
- I guess.

13:46.992 --> 13:51.224
What's the matter? Finn? I thought
things were going well with you two.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.629
They are. I don't know.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.127
I keep waiting for him to say he loves me
and he hasn't.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.808
Some men have to move
at their own pace, Mead'.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.411
It's amazing, isn't it?

14:15.221 --> 14:16.620
Whoa, Nelly.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.520
He'll be all right.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.188
So, what do you say? You boys hungry?

14:24.697 --> 14:27.689
- No, we got to go.
- The limo's on its way up from Norwalk.

14:27.766 --> 14:30.257
Marty, why don't you chopper them out?

14:30.336 --> 14:34.136
Chopper? That's fucking awesome.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.334
I'll call Doug. See if it's available.

14:43.682 --> 14:45.650
I got Tony Soprano here.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.250
He was asking if the chopper's available.

14:51.257 --> 14:52.451
I know.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.353
This new fucking girl told him.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.257
I know.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.491
About $15,000 between the five of them.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.466
I know.

15:09.141 --> 15:10.369
Righty-o.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.010
Good news, gentlemen.

15:26.892 --> 15:28.325
Sorry about the mess.

15:28.394 --> 15:32.228
Mr. Soprano? Greg Erwitt.
You got any luggage?

15:32.298 --> 15:34.129
- Just him.
- He's drunk.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.996
He was just with the girls.

15:37.336 --> 15:41.204
- So, Caldwell Airport, right?
- Fuck that, how about Maui?

15:42.174 --> 15:44.472
Just climb on in and buckle up.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.075
Oh, Jesus! Old Faithful.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.445
Better here than at 2,000 feet.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.341
I got to take a piss.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.624
Oh, yeah!

16:04.496 --> 16:06.760
<i>Hasta la vista!</i>

16:22.181 --> 16:24.149
What the fuck you doing?

16:27.252 --> 16:29.311
You're standing too close.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.449
- Furio come by?
- He's already 40 minutes late.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.818
He's probably worse off than me.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.588
What, did you two go out?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.784
Can I get a cup of coffee?

17:49.501 --> 17:52.664
- Where the fuck is he?
- Was he out with somebody last night?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.138
He's a single guy. How should I know?

17:55.207 --> 17:57.641
Anyway, my memory's a little hazy.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.746
I'm going back to bed.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.184
When he gets here, don't wake me.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.565
<i>l'm not home now, leave a message.</i>

18:48.160 --> 18:50.560
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</i>

18:50.796 --> 18:51.990
Meadow, hi.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.464
You all right?
You don't sound happy to hear from me.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.201
- Of course I am. What's up?
- Nothing.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.670
I was calling to invite you over
for dinner Sunday...

19:00.739 --> 19:03.037
so Dad can see the place and meet the crew.

19:03.108 --> 19:06.202
- How nice, what brought that on?
- I figure before break.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.803
Finn invited me
to go ski in Canada next week.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.942
- You want me to make anything?
- Nothing, I'm doing everything myself.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.717
<i>Maybe wine.</i>

19:15.120 --> 19:17.714
We only drink good wine
when parents come.

19:17.789 --> 19:20.121
<i>- Anyway, l got to go.
- Okay, bye.</i>

20:01.266 --> 20:03.962
- Nice place.
- Yeah, we open in a few weeks.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.437
Carmine got the chef from Fontanella.
Killer wine list.

20:07.806 --> 20:11.503
Look at this, it used to hang
in Fiorello LaGuardia's office.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.408
Who's that, Carmine in that boat?

20:13.478 --> 20:15.503
Gin and I are going over next month.

20:15.581 --> 20:16.673
<i>Salute.</i>

20:22.487 --> 20:23.579
Listen, Tony.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.715
It's very important to Carmine
that we work something out.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.817
If it's so important, where is he?

20:28.894 --> 20:32.159
His son's leaving tomorrow.
He had family obligations.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.360
So what is it, what's the offer?

20:34.433 --> 20:37.425
Forty percent of the HUD take
across the board, starting now.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.560
Forty?

20:39.171 --> 20:42.470
I thought Little Carmine said
he was gonna take care of this.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.668
He did, that's why the concession.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.370
We were at 40 a week ago.

20:46.445 --> 20:49.380
Whatever is done already is done.
You keep that for yourself.

20:49.448 --> 20:52.042
The 40 percent only applies to future deals.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.382
Let's go.

21:10.135 --> 21:13.366
- Darlene, hi, how are you?
- Great. You know, I wanted to thank you.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.498
Your husband's friend came by the office.
We got the listing.

21:16.575 --> 21:20.272
- Which friend, who?
- Furio Gunther, is that how you say it?

21:20.379 --> 21:22.404
His house just went on the market.

21:22.481 --> 21:25.211
Hi, Penny. How are you?

21:59.017 --> 22:01.451
All right, I'll talk to you later.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.680
Who was that?

22:06.858 --> 22:07.950
Silvio.

22:09.127 --> 22:10.594
Listen to this...

22:10.762 --> 22:13.925
Furio called,
the stupid fucking zip moved back to Italy.

22:14.700 --> 22:18.727
Asshole left a message on the
answering machine at the Bing at 4:30 a. m.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.263
Here, carry this.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.714
- Flower delivery.
- Come on in, I'll be right there.

22:39.658 --> 22:41.250
- Hi, Mrs. Soprano.
- Hi, Finn.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.419
Mr. Soprano, Finn Detrolio.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.726
Finn the dentist, right?

22:45.797 --> 22:48.493
Someday. I'm still waiting
to hear from dental school.

22:48.567 --> 22:51.730
Remind me to talk to you
about this loose filling later.

22:57.109 --> 23:00.374
These are beautiful. Thank you.

23:06.752 --> 23:10.779
- So, what smells so good in there?
- Mom's recipe for chicken cacciatore.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.883
You see, I should've known.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.457
- You always leave your door open like that?
- I'm cooking, it's hot.

23:17.529 --> 23:19.326
I'll protect her, don't worry.

23:21.266 --> 23:24.429
You hear that? Anybody bothers her,
he'll knock their teeth out.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.937
Then he can put them back in, too.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.971
These are my roommates, Colin and Alex.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.107
So, you're her roommate, too?

23:35.180 --> 23:37.842
Colin McDermott.
I've heard so much about you.

23:37.916 --> 23:41.477
- So he lives here and you don't?
- Dad.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.779
- I have a place on 118th Street.
- Good.

23:46.191 --> 23:48.284
I'll show you around later.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.563
So, Finn. Where you from?

23:58.637 --> 24:00.070
My dad was in the Navy.

24:00.138 --> 24:04.006
I was born in Japan, spent my first 10 years
on a base near the Azores.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.837
- So, your dad was a sailor?
- Surgeon, actually.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.041
- So, you've been all over the world.
- Yeah, pretty much.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.582
- Would you like a mushroom?
- No, I don't think so.

24:18.857 --> 24:21.451
- Have one, they're good.
- Maybe later.

24:23.495 --> 24:25.360
I got to tell you, Mrs. Soprano...

24:25.430 --> 24:28.991
your daughter absolutely keeps us alive
with her cooking.

24:29.601 --> 24:31.762
Didn't you make macaroni and cheese once?

24:31.837 --> 24:33.702
Well, I didn't want to brag.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.957
Yo, guys, come here, look at this.

25:06.905 --> 25:10.170
So, Finn, Meadow tells me
that you're going skiing.

25:10.308 --> 25:13.038
For four days next week,
a whole bunch of us.

25:13.144 --> 25:17.103
A friend of my dad has a house
in the Laurentians, near Montreal.

25:18.149 --> 25:20.583
You can ski right onto the trails.

25:20.886 --> 25:24.151
I saw pictures.
There's this humongous stone fireplace.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.715
Just be careful,
with all those accidents you read about.

25:27.792 --> 25:28.918
Sonny Bono.

25:28.994 --> 25:31.792
- How about you, Alex? You ski?
- I used to.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.057
- My family had a retreat near the Pyrenees.
- Pyrenees?

25:35.166 --> 25:37.566
Alex is descended from Spanish royalty.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.230
- Seriously?
- She's our little princess.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.205
My great-great-grandmother was a countess.

25:43.608 --> 25:47.044
<i>- Which makes you...
- Technically I'm an lnfanta de gracia.</i>

25:47.112 --> 25:49.979
But that wouldn't fit on her driver's license.

25:51.082 --> 25:54.176
You might have told me
you were living with royalty.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.549
My daughter's an Italian princess.
Does that count?

25:58.857 --> 26:00.984
My wife, too, for that matter.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.621
- There's more chicken if anyone wants.
- Yeah, I'll take a little more.

26:06.898 --> 26:10.095
- So, A.J., what are you, a junior?
- Next year.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.833
- Did you look at any schools yet?
- Not really.

26:14.472 --> 26:16.337
I'll go to Rutgers, I guess.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.508
Are you passing everything?

26:18.577 --> 26:21.876
<i>- I got a "C" on a paper I did on Bily Budd.
- A "C"?</i>

26:22.948 --> 26:26.315
He usually gets "D's" and "F's. "
What's with you today, you okay?

26:26.384 --> 26:29.911
- He worked so hard on it, why only a "C"?
- I don't know.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.717
<i>- Did you like Bily Budd?
- It was okay.</i>

26:33.925 --> 26:36.985
- My teacher says it's a gay book.
- Mr. Weggler?

26:37.295 --> 26:38.728
That is ridiculous.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.764
I've heard that before.

26:41.633 --> 26:46.366
- That was written when, in the 19th century?
- I didn't even know they had fags back then.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.929
- No offense.
- I'm not gay.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.766
- You're not?
- No.

26:53.211 --> 26:56.510
I read where they found
gay cave drawings in Africa.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.343
Really? Shut up.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.454
This stuff is pervading
our educational system...

27:03.521 --> 27:06.081
not to mention movies, TV shows.

27:06.424 --> 27:09.552
- What stuff?
- This gay nonsense they're teaching.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.358
<i>I am sorry,
but Bily Budd is not a homosexual book.</i>

27:12.430 --> 27:14.125
Actually, it is, Mother.

27:14.199 --> 27:16.292
I saw the movie, Meadow,
with Terence Stamp.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.098
<i>Terence Stamp was in
Priscila, Queen Of The Desert.</i>

27:19.170 --> 27:20.762
I don't know about that.

27:20.839 --> 27:23.603
<i>But Bily Budd
is a story of an innocent sailor...</i>

27:23.675 --> 27:25.666
being picked on by an evil boss.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.905
Who is picking on him out of self-loathing...

27:27.979 --> 27:31.244
caused by homosexual feelings
in a military context.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.149
- Oh, please.
- Okay.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.386
Actually, Mrs. Soprano...

27:36.554 --> 27:38.044
there is a passage in the book...

27:38.123 --> 27:41.718
where Melville compares Billy
to a nude statue of Adam before the Fall.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.852
- Really?
- I thought you read it.

27:43.928 --> 27:46.328
So, it's a biblical reference,
does that make it gay?

27:46.398 --> 27:49.162
- What's the difference?
- I'm just saying it's ridiculous...

27:49.234 --> 27:51.634
how everything is being sold
as homosexual nowadays.

27:51.703 --> 27:55.332
Must be a gay book.
Billy Budd's the ship's florist, right?

27:58.810 --> 28:02.143
Leslie Fiedler has written extensively
on gay themes in literature...

28:02.213 --> 28:04.807
<i>since the early '60s, Bily Budd in particular.</i>

28:04.883 --> 28:07.044
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

28:07.118 --> 28:11.145
She's a "he," Mother, and he's lectured
at Columbia, as a matter of fact.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.881
Well, maybe he's gay,
you ever thought of that?

28:22.233 --> 28:23.461
They broke the urn.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.305
He sent Little Paulie
to trash Carmine's restaurant?

28:32.377 --> 28:33.708
He works for me.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.343
What do I know?

28:36.981 --> 28:39.108
A lot more than me, that's for sure.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.375
Everybody does.

28:44.589 --> 28:48.685
We've been friends a long time, Paulie.
I'm gonna go off the record here.

28:50.228 --> 28:54.597
You know, I probably shouldn't be telling
you this, but since you ask...

28:55.967 --> 28:59.300
I think certain people
are starting to wonder where your heart is.

28:59.838 --> 29:03.205
People who? Tony?
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

29:04.008 --> 29:06.875
Right there. Your attitude lately.

29:07.145 --> 29:09.909
Four months inside,
I'm supposed to skip down the street?

29:10.081 --> 29:13.539
You're only as good as your last envelope.
You know that.

29:14.719 --> 29:18.177
You have any idea what Albert
kicked up last week?

29:18.890 --> 29:20.983
Fuck that fucking parakeet.

29:21.359 --> 29:24.192
I got a relationship with Tony
Albert'll never have.

29:24.362 --> 29:27.058
No matter how far he sticks his tongue
up Tony's ass.

29:27.132 --> 29:29.100
All right, fuck this.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.395
Every friendship has its peaks and valleys.

29:34.873 --> 29:37.842
Right now, me and Tony are in the valley.

29:39.377 --> 29:42.175
The cycle comes around, it'll be different.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.909
I'm past worrying I gotta be the top earner
every fucking second.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.679
So there you go then.

29:50.155 --> 29:52.214
Don't give me that smart-alecky shit.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.822
Don't forget,
I go back in this family to Johnny.

29:56.327 --> 29:57.726
Before you even.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.259
It's your fault anyway.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.930
All this shit started with that Russian prick
when I had to go pick up your $5,000.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.064
You know,
things might be a little different, Paulie...

30:09.407 --> 30:12.376
if you'd accept
some responsibility for a change.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.371
You're a wormy cocksucker, you know that?

30:15.780 --> 30:19.272
I'm just telling you
how you're being fucking perceived!

30:19.350 --> 30:21.682
Just worry
about how you're fucking perceived!

30:22.153 --> 30:25.520
Nobody knows what the future holds,
my friend.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.511
You heard what he did
to the fucking restaurant?

30:49.581 --> 30:51.572
So how do you want to respond?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.446
We got to break this guy's back.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.356
I haven't wanted to do this.

31:01.125 --> 31:02.649
But it's gotta be.

31:03.494 --> 31:05.155
Call the union.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.592
His mother was coming.

31:08.666 --> 31:10.566
He was so excited, Ro.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.662
We had a date to go to Colortile.

31:13.771 --> 31:17.036
- A date?
- To look at tile for his mother's apartment.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.436
No phone call, no note.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.047
- I know I sound foolish.
- No, you don't, honey.

31:27.685 --> 31:29.846
When I ran into Darlene at church...

31:30.321 --> 31:32.687
I felt like somebody punched me
in the stomach.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.654
I almost threw up the sacrament.

31:35.793 --> 31:38.523
- What am I gonna do, Ro?
- What's there to do?

31:38.596 --> 31:41.087
A couple of months,
you'll forget all about him.

31:42.166 --> 31:43.599
I don't know if I can.

31:43.701 --> 31:46.169
You don't think Tony
said something to him, do you?

31:58.016 --> 32:01.816
I didn't see what all the fuss was,
particularly for what it cost.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.521
<i>Remember we saw Man of La Mancha
that time?</i>

32:04.689 --> 32:09.683
<i>Richard Kiley stared at Ma the whole time
he was singing The lmpossible Dream.</i>

32:10.495 --> 32:13.692
- How I cried.
- Give me Sondheim any day.

32:13.965 --> 32:17.423
When Salvatore was alive,
Minn went to the theater every week.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.402
He did well, Salvatore.

32:19.604 --> 32:23.199
- Barber scissors, right?
- Precision cutlery, 46 years.

32:23.741 --> 32:25.538
There you are, sir.

32:26.244 --> 32:28.041
Finally, the doggy bags.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.713
I give these to my son.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.661
Here's for Ma and me.
Parking and gas, I'll take care of.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.458
I have $100 I need to break.

32:49.634 --> 32:50.931
Come on, Ma.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.069
Shoot, I forgot to cash my check.

32:54.138 --> 32:58.040
- Don't you have direct deposit?
- She doesn't even have a savings account.

32:58.109 --> 33:02.307
- I like to have the money right in my hands.
- Still keep it under the mattress?

33:02.380 --> 33:05.372
Never you mind where I keep it.
I need change.

33:08.453 --> 33:09.852
Where's my rolls?

33:11.723 --> 33:13.748
- I don't know, Ma.
- Waiter?

33:19.097 --> 33:22.157
These Parker House rolls,
they belong to my ma.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.631
They do not. They were for the table.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.639
Wrap these up, will you? Cellophane.

33:34.445 --> 33:35.639
Come on, Ma.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.267
What the fuck is this now?

34:09.112 --> 34:11.239
<i>Can l have your attention, please?</i>

34:11.315 --> 34:14.216
<i>l repeat, can l have your attention, please?</i>

34:15.053 --> 34:16.679
Whoa. What's going on?

34:16.821 --> 34:18.447
You the foreman? Dave Fusco.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.121
I'm the business agent
for Local 87, Laborers.

34:21.192 --> 34:23.592
It's come to our attention
this site is employing...

34:23.661 --> 34:27.495
a substantial number of non-union laborers
in violation of our master contract.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.964
Come on, what the fuck?

34:29.033 --> 34:33.367
- Frankly, sir, I'm shocked and appalled.
- Yeah, right. What are you, fucking kidding?

34:33.438 --> 34:36.635
<i>This site is shut down until further notice.</i>

34:46.951 --> 34:49.215
Hey, how you doing?

34:50.353 --> 34:54.222
We just want you to know how glad
we are a guy like you is on the jury.

34:54.692 --> 34:57.252
That mob thing, that Junior Soprano trial.

34:59.163 --> 35:01.131
- I got that.
- $14.20.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.234
Hey, what are you doing?

35:04.402 --> 35:05.835
It's a privilege.

35:06.237 --> 35:07.602
Hard-working guy.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.800
Wife and two kids.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.275
Performing a civic duty
we should all take part in.

35:13.644 --> 35:15.771
We know you'll do the right thing.

35:50.081 --> 35:52.777
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me, what are you doing?

35:53.384 --> 35:56.012
Nothing, just reading. You all right?

35:56.554 --> 35:58.647
<i>Yeah, l just wanted to talk to you.</i>

35:59.490 --> 36:01.355
Did I do something to piss you off?

36:01.592 --> 36:03.082
What are you talking about?

36:03.161 --> 36:05.721
I know you were kinda mad at me
the other night.

36:05.796 --> 36:08.128
<i>- Why would I be mad?
- l don't know.</i>

36:09.600 --> 36:11.625
Anyway, the reason I called.

36:12.436 --> 36:16.532
It's kind of near my birthday
and I was thinking we'd do our tradition.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.968
Go to the Plaza for tea
under Eloise's picture.

36:20.745 --> 36:22.713
Really? That's so wonderful.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.210
Are you crying?

36:26.918 --> 36:29.318
I'm just happy, that's so thoughtful.

36:29.453 --> 36:33.116
I was thinking tomorrow. It's the only day
I have before we go to Canada.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.691
Well, I have my nails in the morning,
but I could...

36:39.864 --> 36:41.331
drive in and meet you after that.

36:41.399 --> 36:44.368
Actually, I'll be on the West Side,
maybe you can pick me up?

36:44.435 --> 36:46.835
Sure. I'll take
the George Washington Bridge.

36:46.904 --> 36:49.168
Why take the bridge
if you're going to midtown?

36:49.240 --> 36:53.176
- I know how to get to the city, Meadow.
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

36:53.678 --> 36:55.646
- How's 1:00?
- That's fine.

36:55.746 --> 36:57.976
<i>On second thought, l'l just meet you there.</i>

36:58.049 --> 37:00.244
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.819
Well, it happened.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.722
Stubborn old fuck shut down the Esplanade.

37:11.796 --> 37:14.356
This business agent
he owns was there from the union.

37:14.432 --> 37:16.423
Put on an Emmy-caliber performance.

37:16.567 --> 37:21.163
Let him run this 40 percent bullshit by
the other bosses, see if they put up with it!

37:21.239 --> 37:24.231
If you want,
we could torch a few of his cement trucks.

37:28.713 --> 37:31.443
No. No retaliation, counter-retaliation.

37:31.882 --> 37:34.612
- We just sit tight.
- It's gonna cost us, T.

37:35.386 --> 37:38.685
- That's why Carmine did it.
- It's gonna cost him, too.

37:47.131 --> 37:50.066
- I brought these!
- Sorry.

37:50.234 --> 37:54.295
I am not wearing the gloves.
Soprano family tradition, notwithstanding.

37:54.572 --> 37:56.039
I didn't think so.

37:57.174 --> 37:58.801
But I'm wearing mine.

37:59.677 --> 38:01.167
Where'd you park?

38:01.245 --> 38:03.475
There's a lot over on 57th Street.

38:03.614 --> 38:06.606
Is that okay or would you like
to lecture me on parking, too?

38:06.684 --> 38:08.083
What are you talking about?

38:08.152 --> 38:11.383
I figure since you're also an authority
on driving directions.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.855
- Very funny.
- Not to mention literature.

38:14.425 --> 38:16.086
<i>So it's the Bily Budd thing.</i>

38:17.128 --> 38:18.925
I was merely pointing out to you...

38:18.996 --> 38:21.829
what serious literary critics
have to say about the book.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.966
These look delicious.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.647
So, how is Finn?
When are you leaving for Montreal?

38:36.847 --> 38:40.408
Wednesday morning. He'll pick me up
at home, I have my ski clothes there...

38:40.484 --> 38:43.510
so I'm gonna stay over the night before
and do some laundry.

38:44.188 --> 38:47.453
- Is that a problem?
- No, of course not.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.726
As long as he stays in the guest room.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.557
He's not staying, Mother.

38:51.929 --> 38:54.363
Well, the way you two hang on each other...

38:54.432 --> 38:58.266
Well, excuse me, Mrs. Danvers.
What do you have against love?

39:00.571 --> 39:03.005
- Nothing.
- Why are you not happy for me?

39:05.042 --> 39:08.136
What, are you jealous?
Just 'cause you and Dad are middle-aged?

39:08.212 --> 39:10.009
Watch it, young lady.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.911
- What, am I a child?
- Actually, yes.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.781
Your apartment
in Manhattan, notwithstanding.

39:15.853 --> 39:16.877
What?

39:16.954 --> 39:19.787
I'm sure your friend the princess
found us quite amusing.

39:19.857 --> 39:22.724
You're the one who wanted me
to go to an Ivy League school.

39:22.793 --> 39:25.626
These are the type who go there.
There are also people...

39:25.696 --> 39:29.393
who grew up without indoor plumbing
but you would know even less about them.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.161
Would you rather I transfer
to Montclair State?

39:32.236 --> 39:34.636
Then maybe I can drop out like you did.

39:41.512 --> 39:42.570
I'm sorry.

39:42.646 --> 39:46.377
I invited you here to have a nice time,
not to belittle me.

39:46.784 --> 39:49.218
Maybe you'll be happier
if I didn't come around.

39:49.286 --> 39:52.653
Except that won't happen.
'Cause you'll need money in about a week.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.287
You know what?
To hell with not coming around...

39:55.359 --> 39:59.159
I'll just transfer to Northwestern
so I can be near Finn when he goes.

40:44.842 --> 40:45.831
Yeah, sure.

40:49.346 --> 40:51.644
Carmine, hey, what are you doing here?

40:51.715 --> 40:55.048
- I'm a guest. My housekeeper's daughter.
- Small world.

40:55.519 --> 40:57.749
The groom's dad is my third cousin.

40:59.323 --> 41:00.517
Beautiful ceremony.

41:02.693 --> 41:06.060
So, listen,
about all this stuff that's going on.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.728
- Tony and all.
- What's your name again?

41:09.467 --> 41:12.197
Paulie Gualtieri. Jersey?

41:12.536 --> 41:15.130
Your father was run over by a trolley, right?

41:16.707 --> 41:18.732
Johnny talked to you about me, right?

41:19.076 --> 41:20.737
Johnny who? Sack?

41:21.645 --> 41:23.670
Talk to me about what?

42:20.170 --> 42:22.468
- Anything good?
- Just bills.

42:29.480 --> 42:33.075
- So, you never told me about your lunch.
- It was horrible, since you ask.

42:33.250 --> 42:36.242
She's threatening to transfer
to Northwestern.

42:37.221 --> 42:40.281
- What brought that on?
- Boyfriend probably, Finn.

42:40.424 --> 42:43.689
Maybe she wants to put some space
between us, I don't know.

42:44.929 --> 42:48.262
- Why would she wanna do that?
- You know, frankly, I don't care.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.766
The way I feel now, if I never see her again,
that would be just fine.

42:52.736 --> 42:56.297
- How could you say that?
- Look, Tony, I don't feel well.

42:56.941 --> 43:00.069
My joints ache, my stomach is all queasy.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.076
You asked, I told.

43:03.948 --> 43:05.108
Just making conversation.

43:05.182 --> 43:07.480
If you don't care what the answer is,
don't ask!

43:07.551 --> 43:09.348
All right, calm down!

43:11.789 --> 43:13.381
I don't have enough on my plate?

43:13.457 --> 43:16.984
One of my key guys disappeared
to Naples for Christ's sakes!

43:35.813 --> 43:37.781
Have you seen my Nordica goggles?

43:37.948 --> 43:39.677
Yeah, they're in the basement.

43:39.750 --> 43:42.082
I had to solder something in my computer.

43:42.152 --> 43:45.053
<i>- What're you reading?
- Death in Venice.</i>

43:45.556 --> 43:46.989
Mr. Weggler assigned it.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.449
Where's Mom?

43:51.662 --> 43:52.959
Bed, I guess.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.122
- She seem weird to you lately?
- How?

43:56.200 --> 43:59.692
- Angry, sad?
- I guess she's been crying a lot.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.937
- Since when?
- Last week.

44:02.339 --> 44:05.308
- I think she's upset about Furio's dad.
- Why, what do you mean?

44:05.376 --> 44:06.536
Well, he died.

44:06.610 --> 44:09.204
And I think Furio went back
to Italy or something.

44:09.279 --> 44:11.747
- She was going over there a lot.
- To Furio's?

44:11.815 --> 44:15.251
She was helping him decorate.
And she made me go, too.

44:15.819 --> 44:17.810
It was really a pain in the ass.

44:18.088 --> 44:20.181
She took you there? More than once?

44:20.290 --> 44:22.758
I don't know, a couple, three times.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.054
Oh, dude.

44:27.598 --> 44:30.726
- Meeting's over.
- Jesus!

45:12.142 --> 45:13.131
Who's there?

45:14.712 --> 45:15.906
What're you doing?

45:16.747 --> 45:18.806
Minn! Your door was open.

45:19.483 --> 45:21.314
I brought you something from my ma.

45:21.652 --> 45:23.347
What are you doing in my house?

45:23.420 --> 45:25.684
Take it easy. I didn't know you were home.

45:25.756 --> 45:28.452
- Your car was gone.
- It's being repaired.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.026
- What are you doing?
- Calling your mother.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.165
I know you.

45:40.804 --> 45:42.271
You got any coffee?

45:42.606 --> 45:45.040
My kitchen's all wiped off for the night.

45:45.109 --> 45:47.634
Well, this week then, I'll bring my ma...

45:47.711 --> 45:50.544
the three of us,
we'll go have lunch over at Pal's Cabin.

45:50.881 --> 45:52.314
You're here to rob me.

45:52.382 --> 45:55.078
No, what are you crazy?
Just calm down, okay?

45:55.152 --> 45:57.143
You're a disgrace to your mother!

45:57.221 --> 46:00.019
Don't set that thing off!
You think I'm here to hurt you?

46:00.591 --> 46:03.389
- You've known me since I'm a kid.
- Help!

46:03.794 --> 46:05.421
What are you doing?

46:11.201 --> 46:12.190
Fuck!

46:16.373 --> 46:17.738
Minn, wait!

46:18.842 --> 46:21.037
You were always a little bastard!

46:21.111 --> 46:22.976
Shut up with that fucking mouth!

46:27.317 --> 46:28.875
Help!

46:36.560 --> 46:38.027
Oh, no.

47:09.092 --> 47:11.652
- There's the skip.
- Hey.

47:22.639 --> 47:23.731
For you.

47:24.541 --> 47:26.634
I know things have been slow lately.

47:27.077 --> 47:28.908
That ought to bring us up to date.

47:29.146 --> 47:32.172
- What'd you do, rob a bank?
- Back in business, T.

47:32.649 --> 47:35.641
- What, are you going to track?
- Thinking about it.

47:35.886 --> 47:37.911
Ton'! Johnny Sack for you.

47:38.889 --> 47:41.653
- What's that prick want?
- I don't know.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.061
Let me take this.

48:00.377 --> 48:01.605
Hello?

48:02.479 --> 48:03.673
Thought we did.

48:07.150 --> 48:09.141
All right, I'll meet you.

48:15.826 --> 48:17.726
Did you say goodbye to your mother?

48:17.995 --> 48:20.520
She went to the market
while I was in the shower.

48:29.873 --> 48:31.397
She loves you, Meadow.

48:32.409 --> 48:34.434
You know that, don't you?

48:36.246 --> 48:37.770
- I know.
- Come here.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.725
Cut her some slack, will you?

48:48.792 --> 48:51.818
You gotta understand,
she's going through a rough time right now.

48:51.895 --> 48:54.363
- How come?
- Change of life, maybe.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.129
Her kids are growing up.

48:59.670 --> 49:02.366
We talked about this in counseling,
me and her.

49:02.773 --> 49:04.206
You guys went to counseling?

49:04.274 --> 49:07.937
Yeah, it's part of the therapy
for the panic attacks and all.

49:08.111 --> 49:11.239
- You were in therapy?
- You knew that, didn't you?

49:11.682 --> 49:13.047
Oh, my God.

49:14.351 --> 49:16.979
On some level she may feel...

49:18.255 --> 49:19.688
unfulfilled.

49:21.625 --> 49:24.617
<i>Switch on Rosie O'Donnel,
that's all these women bitch about.</i>

49:26.897 --> 49:29.593
A little of that's probably my fault anyway.

49:32.769 --> 49:34.737
It's an epidemic, right?

49:38.342 --> 49:40.435
- You really think that's it?
- Yeah.

49:48.185 --> 49:50.949
It's probably the beginning of menopause,
like you said.

49:52.055 --> 49:54.080
All right, you go have a good time.

49:54.725 --> 49:56.090
Thanks.

50:33.563 --> 50:35.531
Well, here I am, what is it?

50:36.633 --> 50:38.760
We go back a long way, Tony.

50:38.969 --> 50:41.961
We've come way too far
to let it all go to shit.

50:42.105 --> 50:46.132
With all due respect, you wanna go
down memory lane, put it in second gear.

50:46.610 --> 50:48.271
The Esplanade now.

50:49.146 --> 50:52.081
I wish for Carmine's own sake he'd ease off.

50:54.618 --> 50:56.381
Why don't you tell him that?

50:56.787 --> 50:58.948
He's so easily upset these days.

50:59.122 --> 51:00.214
His teeth.

51:00.824 --> 51:03.657
I'll tell you, that restaurant thing didn't help.

51:04.161 --> 51:06.994
He hurt my appraiser.
What was I supposed to do?

51:07.364 --> 51:10.390
It's on page four
of the boss manual, John. Jesus!

51:10.667 --> 51:13.192
You're preaching to the choir, Tony.

51:14.438 --> 51:17.100
You don't even wanna hear
how many of his decisions...

51:17.174 --> 51:19.199
end up lightening my pockets.

51:26.850 --> 51:28.909
Why you telling me all this, John?

51:28.985 --> 51:31.783
Because at heart,
I know you're a pragmatist.

51:31.855 --> 51:32.879
As I am.

51:34.925 --> 51:36.358
I'm telling you now...

51:37.427 --> 51:38.917
Carmine won't bend.

51:40.330 --> 51:42.230
And I just told you, I won't.

51:42.732 --> 51:44.563
If Carmine's health were bad...

51:46.136 --> 51:48.730
if something were to happen to him,
God forbid...

51:51.541 --> 51:54.066
all of this unpleasantness would just...

51:54.478 --> 51:56.070
John, Carmine's fine.

51:57.114 --> 52:00.049
Yes. He's very healthy.

52:01.418 --> 52:02.407
Thank God.

52:04.588 --> 52:05.577
Call me.

52:15.031 --> 52:16.123
Holy shit.

52:19.936 --> 52:22.962
<i>As soon as we get off this barge,
l never wanna see you again.</i>

52:32.015 --> 52:33.505
<i>- Yes?
- Tonight?</i>

52:34.417 --> 52:35.406
<i>No.</i>

52:40.123 --> 52:41.522
You're home early.

52:44.895 --> 52:46.556
What are you watching?

52:47.998 --> 52:49.488
<i>How to Marry a Milionaire.</i>

52:51.234 --> 52:52.599
Do I have a fever?

52:56.673 --> 52:58.300
Maybe. A little.

53:00.143 --> 53:02.111
- You want some Advil?
- I took some.

53:07.717 --> 53:09.514
I talked to Meadow this morning.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.678
She left for her ski trip.

53:16.026 --> 53:17.550
She's a good kid, Carm.

53:18.061 --> 53:19.585
She hates my guts, Tony.

53:19.796 --> 53:21.593
She doesn't hate you.

53:22.832 --> 53:24.390
She's gonna call you.

53:25.068 --> 53:27.161
Come on, you know how that works.

53:28.505 --> 53:29.699
Finn will go.

53:31.074 --> 53:33.770
She'll forget all about him
in a couple of weeks.

53:35.412 --> 53:39.371
In a few years she'll find somebody else,
settle down.

53:42.586 --> 53:44.486
Maybe she won't, who knows.

53:46.856 --> 53:48.983
She can do whatever she wants.

53:52.862 --> 53:55.422
She's becoming a wonderful woman, Carm.

53:55.865 --> 53:57.833
Smart, beautiful...

53:59.469 --> 54:01.801
independent woman that you created.

54:05.041 --> 54:07.202
Isn't that what you dreamed about?

54:10.447 --> 54:11.436
Yes.
