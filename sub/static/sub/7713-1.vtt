lt's great to see you, Kev.
You, too.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.628
l'm keeping
a list of everyone
who wrongs me.

22:18.713 --> 22:21.548
So when l'm back on top,
they'll be sorry.

l want to apologize
for how l treated you
last year.

22:30.016 --> 22:34.769
l lost sight of myself
and now that
l've quit the rat race,

22:34.854 --> 22:36.187
l realize there's
so much more to life

22:36.272 --> 22:39.232
than being the youngest VP
in the company's history.

22:39.316 --> 22:43.820
l've even
started volunteering,
giving back to the community.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.572
That's great.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.533
You're talking about
your court-ordered
community service?

22:48.617 --> 22:51.369
l don't need a judge
to tell me to keep
my community clean.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.204
But he did, right?

22:53.289 --> 22:55.165
All right.
All right.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.841
Well, you lost
zero pounds.
No change.

On the brighter side,
you gained zero pounds.

l can't do this
by myself, people!

who've either passed out
or almost passed out!

a very hard life.

lovers with her first

weigh ourselves again
at the end of the day

this thing after all.
