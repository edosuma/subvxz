00:01.640 --> 00:04.246
Great. So,um,I'll give you a call.

00:04.256 --> 00:06.522
- I hope you do.
- All right.

00:08.697 --> 00:09.850
Look at this.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.547
I just got that girl's
number. Check it out.

00:12.557 --> 00:15.013
Holly. Nice.

00:15.023 --> 00:18.803
Girls whose names end
in L-Y are always dirty.

00:18.833 --> 00:22.322
Holly,Kelly,Carly,Lily.

00:24.156 --> 00:26.482
Oh,yeah,I know it's true.

00:26.492 --> 00:30.863
And don't even get me started on
girlshose names should end in Y,

00:30.873 --> 00:32.728
but instead end in I.

00:32.747 --> 00:35.174
Those girls are like roller coasters.

00:35.204 --> 00:37.439
You got to wait in a long
line,but once you get up there,

00:37.479 --> 00:40.366
you just hold on for dear life
and hope you don't drop your keys.

00:40.988 --> 00:42.152
Hey,you know what I'm gonna do?

00:42.182 --> 00:44.016
I'm gonna call her right now.

00:44.036 --> 00:47.485
I'm gonna do that whole,"Hey,remember
me? It's been so long."

00:48.807 --> 00:50.653
See,it's funny because I just saw her.

00:50.673 --> 00:51.996
Dude,you can't call her.

00:52.016 --> 00:54.722
You have to wait three days to
call a woman. That's the rule.

00:54.732 --> 00:56.677
Barney,that rule is
completely played out.

00:56.697 --> 00:58.101
Girls know exactly what you're doing.

00:58.121 --> 01:00.316
Hey,I got a new rule.

01:00.346 --> 01:04.947
It's kind of crazy,but I call
it,You like her,you call her.

01:04.958 --> 01:08.547
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
I don't speak I Never Get Laid.

01:09.399 --> 01:11.976
Barney,the Three Days Rule is insane.

01:11.986 --> 01:14.682
I mean,who even came up with that?

01:15.274 --> 01:16.757
Jesus.

01:16.767 --> 01:19.564
Barney,don't do this. Not with Jesus.

01:19.574 --> 01:23.625
Seriously. Jesus started the
whole wait-three-days thing.

01:23.635 --> 01:25.920
He waited three days
to come back to life.

01:25.950 --> 01:26.953
It was perfect.

01:26.983 --> 01:30.531
If he have only waited one day,a lot of
people wouldn't have even heard that he died.

01:30.562 --> 01:33.038
They'd be all,"Hey,Jesus,what up?"

01:33.058 --> 01:37.339
And Jesus would probably
be,like,"What up? I died yesterday."

01:37.349 --> 01:40.958
And then they'd be all,Uh,you
look pretty alive to me,dude.

01:40.978 --> 01:44.727
And then Jesus would have to explain how
he was resurrected and how it was a miracle.

01:44.767 --> 01:49.269
And then,the dude would
be,like,Uh,okay,whatever you say,bro.

01:49.279 --> 01:52.347
Wow,ancient dialogue
sounds so stilted now.

01:52.377 --> 01:54.361
And he's not going to
come back on a Saturday.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.858
Everybody's busy doing chores.

01:56.878 --> 01:59.715
Working the loom,trimming
their beards. No.

01:59.725 --> 02:04.376
He waits the exact right
number of days... Three.

02:04.386 --> 02:07.805
Okay,I promise-- I'll wait three
days. Just please stop talking.

02:08.637 --> 02:11.735
Plus,it's Sunday,so
everyone's in church already.

02:11.755 --> 02:15.213
They're all in
there,Oh,no,Jesus is dead.

02:15.223 --> 02:19.213
Then,bam! He bursts through
the back door,runs up the aisle.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.507
Everyone's totally psyched.

02:20.536 --> 02:23.554
And,FYI,that's when he
invented the high-five.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.309
Three days,Ted.

02:25.339 --> 02:31.133
We wait three days to call a woman because
that's how long Jesus wants us to wait.

02:33.148 --> 02:35.263
True story.

Mother Season04 Episode21</font>

02:48.517 --> 02:52.907
Okay,fine. I promise,I won't
call Holly for three days.

02:52.917 --> 02:55.644
But I never said anything about texting.

02:55.654 --> 02:58.551
I started things off with
something cute and charming.

02:58.592 --> 03:02.532
"I was thinking about you,so I thought
I'd send you a little texty text."

03:02.892 --> 03:07.664
And the moment I hit "Send," I
realized it wasn't cute at all.

03:07.464 --> 03:10.923
<i>{\a6}texty text</i>

03:07.464 --> 03:10.923
It was the lamest thing
anyone has ever said to anyone.

03:10.933 --> 03:14.140
And the worst thing about texting
is that once you send it...

03:16.736 --> 03:20.145
Oh,no! No!

03:20.536 --> 03:22.711
you can never get it back.

03:22.731 --> 03:25.308
And then... you wait.

03:23.544 --> 03:27.414
{\a6}******

03:25.318 --> 03:29.559
And just when you've decided
never to text anyone again...

03:30.431 --> 03:32.757
"I've been thinking about you,too,

03:32.767 --> 03:36.206
"and how weird is it that you
texted me while I was in the bath?"

03:43.333 --> 03:44.806
- What was that?
- What?

03:44.816 --> 03:47.874
- You made a noise.
- That was my phone. I got a text.

03:47.884 --> 03:50.992
- Not that. You made your naked lady noise.
- What?

03:51.002 --> 03:55.373
Whenever you see a naked
lady,you make the noise.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.461
I don't do that.

03:58.481 --> 03:59.884
Really?

04:01.959 --> 04:03.754
Oh,God,sorry,Lily.

04:08.686 --> 04:12.576
While the men are out hunting,the women
of New Guinea's indigenous Korowai tribe

04:12.587 --> 04:14.892
wash their clothes in the river.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.526
That's totally a boob.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.964
Is that Holly who keeps texting you?

04:27.984 --> 04:29.688
Didn't you promise to wait three days?

04:29.708 --> 04:32.646
To call,yes. Texting
is totally different.

04:32.656 --> 04:35.904
Okay,well,just try to keep the
naked lady noises to a minimum.

04:35.924 --> 04:38.571
I don't make a naked lady noise.

04:39.814 --> 04:41.969
Really?

04:47.413 --> 04:50.661
Holly and I stayed up texting
until 2:00 in the morning.

04:51.634 --> 04:54.551
And we spent the whole next
day texting each other,too.

04:55.252 --> 04:57.499
She seemed perfect.

04:58.220 --> 05:01.247
Holly just told me what
she's wearing right now.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.802
It is pretty hot.

05:02.832 --> 05:05.869
Yeah,whatever it is,I can
guarantee you she's not wearing it.

05:05.910 --> 05:07.453
She's lying to you to make you like her.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.628
- How do you know that?
- Here. Come here.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.816
Because no woman in the
history of the world is ever

05:12.856 --> 05:18.420
"just sitting around reading architecture
magazines in my old cheerleader uniform."

05:18.801 --> 05:22.742
Okay,maybe she's lying about
the architecture magazines.

05:27.092 --> 05:28.635
Oh,no.

05:28.645 --> 05:30.932
- Oh,no. This is bad.
- What?

05:30.942 --> 05:34.861
She just sent me a text that was
clearly meant for someone else.

05:36.044 --> 05:39.743
"Hey,baby,I picked up some take-out
from Generro's. Be home soon."

05:40.465 --> 05:43.834
Okay,yes,this sounds bad,but
let's think about this,okay?

05:43.874 --> 05:47.734
It could be for a brother
or maybe her sick dad.

05:47.754 --> 05:49.769
Scroll down.

05:50.551 --> 05:54.801
"And then I want you
to do me on the couch."

05:55.122 --> 05:57.718
Okay,maybe not a sick dad.

05:57.728 --> 06:01.558
Or a very sick dad. Am I right?

06:03.092 --> 06:05.126
Sorry.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.244
Hey,guys.

06:08.615 --> 06:10.680
God. What is this?

06:11.322 --> 06:14.009
It's just some take-out from Generro's.
I'm bringing it home for Lily.

06:14.019 --> 06:15.443
Oh,that's weird.

06:15.483 --> 06:19.051
Holly just texted Ted something
about take-out from Generro's.

06:21.057 --> 06:23.182
Wait a second.

06:23.192 --> 06:26.320
- You sons of bitches.
- What?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.107
You're Holly.

06:32.205 --> 06:35.212
So Ted hasn't been texting Holly at all?

06:35.232 --> 06:36.836
He's been texting you two?

06:36.866 --> 06:41.167
Look,we knew he'd try to call her before
the three days,so I swiped his phone,

06:41.197 --> 06:43.382
and I changed her
number to my work cell.

06:43.874 --> 06:49.638
We were just gonna bust on him for calling
her too soon,but then he started texting her.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.886
Texty text?

06:52.906 --> 06:54.209
Oh,Ted.

06:54.229 --> 06:58.520
Oh,poor,sweet Ted. We should...
we should tell him it's us.

06:58.530 --> 07:00.916
Yeah. Or...

07:00.926 --> 07:04.575
we pretend we're Holly,and
we're in the bath.

07:05.277 --> 07:07.492
Yeah,that's better.

07:12.735 --> 07:14.340
Well,that was fun.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.632
We should tell him that it's us.

07:15.663 --> 07:18.580
Yeah,we should. Or...

07:18.590 --> 07:23.562
we tell him our favorite color is red,and
we think the cowboy look is very sexy.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.350
Yeah,that's better.

07:27.191 --> 07:31.814
I'm wearing them right
now,and they do look sexy.

07:32.685 --> 07:36.294
- He put on the boots!
- He totally put on the boots!

07:36.916 --> 07:38.560
- That was awesome!
- Yeah.

07:38.570 --> 07:42.299
But it's time to tell him who
he really put those boots on for.

07:42.309 --> 07:44.675
Yeah. Or...

07:44.685 --> 07:47.322
we just took off our shirt.

07:47.623 --> 07:49.938
Yeah,that's better.

07:50.239 --> 07:54.810
You think maybe we're wearing
a black lace bra underneath?

07:55.663 --> 07:57.948
I don't think we're
wearing anything underneath.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.384
God,we're hot.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.657
Now he's only wearing the
cowboy boots! It is on!

08:05.667 --> 08:07.753
It is so on! Okay,okay,tell
him that we're...

08:07.763 --> 08:11.311
we're slowing slipping out of our...

08:12.615 --> 08:15.091
What are we doing?

08:16.505 --> 08:20.434
I think that we're about
to have sex with Ted.

08:24.605 --> 08:28.153
So,you did this to him
all day? That's just mean.

08:28.163 --> 08:31.783
No,no. No,it was... It was
actually for his own good.

08:31.793 --> 08:33.327
We're protecting him from himself.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.001
He... No. He really likes this girl.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.684
He had that-that look in his eye.

08:36.715 --> 08:40.494
Yeah,that crazy "I'm about to move
too fast and screw this up" look.

08:40.916 --> 08:43.432
It was actually the same look he
had on his first date with you.

08:43.452 --> 08:45.787
- And we all remember how that went.
- Yeah.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.725
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?

08:49.186 --> 08:52.124
Yeah,well,I-I think
I was a special case.

08:52.154 --> 08:55.412
This Holly is no Robin Scherbatsky.

08:55.763 --> 08:57.126
Hey,what is the deal with her hair?

08:57.156 --> 09:02.008
I mean,news flash: they make
conditioners that don't leave a buildup.

09:02.018 --> 09:03.652
I'm so b.

09:03.662 --> 09:06.449
Look,it's been a while since
Ted really liked someone.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.036
He's clearly got a lot of
crazy stored up. We just...

09:09.046 --> 09:12.906
we thought we'd get him to say "I love you"
before he even makes contact with this girl.

09:12.936 --> 09:16.113
And you can tell it's on the way.
He's exhibiting all the telltale signs.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.161
Yeah. One: He joked
about getting married.

09:19.171 --> 09:24.044
"You like architecture? We
should get married." "Ha-ha.LOL."

09:24.054 --> 09:26.891
"Just kidding. Question mark?"

09:26.901 --> 09:30.900
Two: He made a crazy
way-too-soon trip suggestion.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.509
"I like beer,too. We should
totally go to Germany together."

09:34.519 --> 09:38.398
"LOL.JK.LOL."

09:38.900 --> 09:42.770
And three: He got way
too personal way too soon.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.918
"Yeah,my parents got
divorced a couple years back.

09:45.928 --> 09:49.697
It was really tough." LOL."

09:50.158 --> 09:52.494
And he clearly doesn't
know what LOL means.

09:52.504 --> 09:53.827
Yeah,but here's the real problem.

09:53.858 --> 09:57.587
Ted wasn't saying "I love you"
as easily as we thought he would.

09:57.607 --> 10:00.043
Then we met... Stan.

10:06.759 --> 10:09.115
Why are you making so much noise,man?

10:10.258 --> 10:15.602
So we explained everything to him,and when
we were done,something amazing happened.

10:15.993 --> 10:19.552
Why don't you tell Ted that just knowing
he's out there,thinking about you,

10:19.572 --> 10:22.680
caring about you,makes you feel safe?

10:22.740 --> 10:25.898
So,all your fears,all
your yesterdays wash away,

10:25.908 --> 10:30.108
and only hope remains in
the promise of his embrace.

10:32.494 --> 10:34.950
Go,Stan. Who is this guy?

10:34.960 --> 10:36.354
He's a security guard who works nights.

10:36.384 --> 10:38.158
And he eats lunch at
MacLaren's every day.

10:38.178 --> 10:40.624
- And he wasn't done.
- Not by a long shot.

10:41.095 --> 10:43.822
You make me thank God for
every mistake I ever made

10:43.862 --> 10:47.662
because each one led me down
the path that brought me to you.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.161
That's,uh,really nice,man.

10:51.171 --> 10:53.507
Whatever. It's okay.

10:54.448 --> 10:58.128
"And when finally come
together,"I want you to hold me.

10:58.168 --> 11:01.577
Hold me" "all night. Stroke my hair."

11:01.587 --> 11:04.684
"Tell me I'm a woman
and show me you're a man.

11:04.725 --> 11:06.840
Until there there was only now."

11:06.870 --> 11:11.280
You and I... and now."

11:11.290 --> 11:13.487
Yes!

11:14.087 --> 11:17.927
You want me to text
that to Ted. I know that.

11:19.661 --> 11:22.268
"I do not ask "of the
night explanations.

11:22.298 --> 11:25.175
I wait for it,and it envelops me,"

11:25.185 --> 11:31.130
"and so you and bread
and light and shadow are."

11:31.822 --> 11:34.027
That's Pablo Neruda.

11:34.047 --> 11:37.025
I don't know,um,what
bread was doing in there,

11:37.035 --> 11:42.167
but that touched me here and here.

11:42.699 --> 11:46.188
Well,if Ted won't say it,I will.

11:46.388 --> 11:48.774
I love you.

11:50.078 --> 11:52.484
That's cool.

11:53.616 --> 11:54.990
Still nothing,huh?

11:55.010 --> 11:56.433
Maybe he's not in love with us.

11:56.443 --> 11:59.170
How can he not be in love with us?
We're everything he's looking for.

11:59.180 --> 12:01.606
I don't get men.

12:02.358 --> 12:03.612
Got to head to work.

12:03.632 --> 12:05.265
Will you be... Will you be back?

12:06.258 --> 12:10.458
I'll be back when the wind and
fates and chance bring me back.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.363
Which will be tomorrow.

12:12.384 --> 12:15.120
It's cheese steak day.

12:16.784 --> 12:19.852
It sounds like you
were all over this guy.

12:19.872 --> 12:22.198
Hope his girlfriend didn't get jealous.

12:22.218 --> 12:24.814
Did he mention a girlfriend or...

12:25.626 --> 12:30.829
It was all going great until Marshall sent Ted
a text meant for Lily and ruined everything.

12:30.849 --> 12:33.365
Well,it doesn't matter.
Okay? It's over now.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.470
I got to get going,but
here's what's going to happen:

12:35.510 --> 12:39.992
You're going to call him right
now,tell him what you did,and apologize.

12:40.022 --> 12:42.248
- You got it?
- Yes.

12:45.426 --> 12:47.481
Or...

12:47.491 --> 12:50.418
Holly explained everything. It
was all just a misunderstanding.

12:50.428 --> 12:52.834
- Everything's great now.
- Really?

12:52.844 --> 12:55.771
Uh,how did,uh,Holly explain
her way out of that one?

12:55.811 --> 13:01.155
Well,apparently,her dumb friend Marsha accidentally
used her phone to text her husband Billy.

13:01.165 --> 13:02.699
Marsha and Billy.

13:02.729 --> 13:05.285
No one sprained any muscles there.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.353
And now we are better than ever.

13:08.363 --> 13:13.235
Look,I know this sounds crazy,but I think
I might actually be falling for this girl.

13:13.797 --> 13:16.894
- You're falling for Barney and Marshall.
- What?

13:16.904 --> 13:19.651
They didn't believe that you
could wait the three days,

13:19.681 --> 13:23.139
so Barney changed her number
in your phone to his work cell.

13:23.159 --> 13:25.225
Holly is Barney and Marshall.

13:25.235 --> 13:28.072
Wait. That whole time it was them?

13:28.533 --> 13:31.110
So Holly wasn't in the bath?

13:33.676 --> 13:37.606
Or sitting by her window,looking
up at the stars,thinking about me?

13:41.185 --> 13:46.037
Or lounging in her old cheerleader
uniform reading architecture magazines?

13:49.054 --> 13:51.641
Yeah. I don't think they
actually did those things.

13:51.651 --> 13:53.766
They were just at the bar.

13:53.786 --> 13:54.949
Right.

13:54.969 --> 13:56.994
But,yeah,it was them.

13:57.646 --> 13:59.701
- Unbelievab.
- I know.

13:59.711 --> 14:01.686
So you might as well tell
them you're on to them.

14:01.696 --> 14:05.164
Yeah. Or...

14:05.645 --> 14:08.342
I text them something that will
really mess with their heads.

14:08.352 --> 14:12.663
Oh,I gotcha. Okay. How about...

14:12.994 --> 14:17.746
"I haven't told any of my friends
yet,but I only have three months to live?"

14:17.756 --> 14:19.009
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

14:19.019 --> 14:24.022
How about "I once killed a man with a
shovel,and those feelings are creeping up again"?

14:25.084 --> 14:28.864
I-I liked that thing someone said
before about having three months to live.

14:28.884 --> 14:33.595
How about "I never told anyone this,but
I slept with my best friend's mom"?

14:33.615 --> 14:38.107
Oh,that is good,but I feel like we keep
coming back to that three months to live thing.

14:38.557 --> 14:41.245
- Wait. I think I got it.
- Oh,yeah?

14:43.831 --> 14:45.786
He texted back!

14:46.107 --> 14:48.954
"I probably shouldn't tell you this.

14:48.984 --> 14:51.972
I mean we barely know each other."

14:51.992 --> 14:54.317
But what the hell,I'll just say it.

14:54.337 --> 14:56.322
This is it,dude. Here
comes the "I love you."

14:57.064 --> 15:00.122
- I sh Stan were here.
- Stan.

15:03.109 --> 15:04.873
What?

15:04.883 --> 15:09.185
I sometimes have gay
dreams about my best friend.

15:13.675 --> 15:17.835
I sometimes have gay
dreams about my best friend.

15:17.865 --> 15:23.570
Why in the world would Ted text a girl he barely
knows that he sometimes has gay dreams about me?

15:24.663 --> 15:27.018
Slow your roll. You?

15:27.309 --> 15:29.174
He's clearly talking about me.

15:29.184 --> 15:31.621
Dude,it's me. I'm his best friend.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.716
Okay,one: that has never been proven.

15:33.736 --> 15:37.735
Two: If anyone were to have gay
dreams about one of us,it would be me.

15:38.427 --> 15:41.114
I mean,look at me. Now look at you.

15:41.124 --> 15:45.264
A still-in-the-closet 80-year-old
wouldn't be into that mess.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.364
Here's the thing,Barney.
I'm snuggly. You're not.

15:49.374 --> 15:53.124
Who wouldn't want to snuggle up next
to this business on a Sunday morning?

15:53.154 --> 15:57.504
Wrapped in a comforter,and it's raining
outside,and there's muffins warming in the oven.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.311
I'm cuddly,bitch. Deal with it.

16:00.321 --> 16:02.568
I work out every day.

16:02.588 --> 16:06.377
If there is one thing we know about
Ted,it's that he likes a nice body.

16:06.407 --> 16:08.072
This body would rock his world.

16:08.102 --> 16:10.848
Ted and I have a history.
I know what he likes.

16:10.858 --> 16:14.387
There are things I could do to
him that would blow his mind...

16:17.324 --> 16:19.119
Why do we keep trying
to have sex with Ted?

16:19.129 --> 16:21.304
I don't know. It's weird.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.938
Crazy,right?

16:22.958 --> 16:25.424
Ted's having gay dreams about me.

16:25.444 --> 16:29.545
And by me,he means
M-E,Marshall Eriksen,

16:29.575 --> 16:32.272
star of Ted's gay dreams.

16:32.302 --> 16:35.470
Who cares? So Ted has gay
dreams about one of you guys.

16:35.480 --> 16:39.138
It's not like you found out
he has three months to live.

16:39.148 --> 16:42.818
That's like,oh,shocking,right?

16:42.828 --> 16:44.623
Hey,look at this guy.

16:44.633 --> 16:47.069
How's it going,uh,best
friend of 12 years?

16:48.271 --> 16:53.915
Well,it's kind of weird,but,uh,I
had this crazy dream the other night.

16:53.955 --> 16:55.199
It's a little embarrassing.

16:55.219 --> 16:57.906
You can tell us,Ted.
This is a safe space.

16:57.916 --> 17:00.713
ah,your feelings are
perfectly natural,buddy.

17:00.723 --> 17:04.692
Okay. Here's what happened. So I'm at...

17:04.702 --> 17:08.281
And then I proceeded to waste a
half hour of those bastards' lives,

17:08.300 --> 17:09.734
telling them about this dream I had

17:09.744 --> 17:13.574
where I ate dinner with my top five
favorite architects throughout history.

17:13.584 --> 17:17.955
And then,at the end of the meal,Frank
Gehry slides the check over to I.M.Pei,

17:17.965 --> 17:23.398
and he says,Buddy,tonight,your
name is I.M.Paying.

17:23.931 --> 17:27.529
Buckminster Fuller
almost did a spit take.

17:28.702 --> 17:31.168
And then I woke up.

17:31.860 --> 17:34.016
So,that-that's it?

17:34.026 --> 17:35.940
No other dreams?

17:35.950 --> 17:40.251
- Nothing confusing or erotic?
- Nope.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.048
Okay,how about this?

17:43.078 --> 17:46.126
Ted,you know how at some point in the
future,machines will rise up against us?

17:46.136 --> 17:48.692
- Sure. -
Okay.So,the machines--

17:49.013 --> 17:50.396
they've killed everybody,

17:50.436 --> 17:56.793
and all that's left
is you,me,and Barney.

17:57.824 --> 18:00.992
Which one of us would you,like...

18:02.306 --> 18:04.722
get with?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.098
And,um...

18:07.138 --> 18:09.845
why do I have to get with one of you?

18:09.885 --> 18:11.229
The machines are forcing you.

18:11.269 --> 18:13.905
They want to watch. That's
just how they get down.

18:14.447 --> 18:17.234
Oh,that's a... that's
a... That's a tough one.

18:17.244 --> 18:20.471
I guess it would have to be...

18:22.697 --> 18:24.993
Holly.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.446
Robin told me what you guys did.

18:26.486 --> 18:28.091
That's why I made up
the gay dreams thing.

18:28.111 --> 18:30.266
Uh,guys,this is Holly.

18:31.078 --> 18:33.705
And I didn't wait your
precious three days to call her.

18:33.725 --> 18:36.071
I knew where she worked,so
I tracked her down.

18:36.091 --> 18:38.266
Um,let me ask you. Did
I call you too soon?

18:38.276 --> 18:40.822
I loved that he called me right away.

18:40.832 --> 18:42.927
I found it very romantic.

18:42.957 --> 18:45.985
And by the way,I don't sit around my
apartment reading architecture magazines

18:45.995 --> 18:48.491
in my old cheerleader uniform.

18:48.772 --> 18:51.739
I do that completely naked.

18:55.409 --> 18:57.855
So,uh,Holly and I are
going out to dinner.

18:57.865 --> 18:59.859
- I'll meet you out front.
- Okay.

19:01.825 --> 19:04.542
I'm sorr bud. We-We were
just trying to help you.

19:04.552 --> 19:08.090
And,also,it was really fun.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.933
I don't need your help,okay?
I can take care of myself.

19:13.324 --> 19:14.707
And,yeah,maybe...

19:14.727 --> 19:17.594
maybe there are some girls who wouldn't
like it that I called them right away

19:17.624 --> 19:20.160
or said things too soon,but guess what?

19:20.190 --> 19:22.646
Those aren't the right girls for me.

19:22.666 --> 19:25.905
Maybe the right girl is the one
who loves that I do those thin

19:25.935 --> 19:31.749
because that's just who I am,and I'm not going
to change because of some stupid Three Days Rule.

19:33.854 --> 19:38.316
Oh,and,um,Holly spells
her name with an "I."

19:39.699 --> 19:44.781
So I had proven that the Three Days Rule was
wrong,and I was out to dinner with a pretty girl.

19:44.801 --> 19:49.043
And until right now,I've never told anyone
the truth about what happened on that date.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.729
That's so funny! I love indie music,too.

19:51.739 --> 19:53.764
We should get married.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.584
Just kidding. Or am I?

19:58.045 --> 19:59.589
Just kidding again.

19:59.619 --> 20:01.543
That's it. We're totally
going to Brazil together!

20:01.824 --> 20:05.985
And I went to my doctor this morning,and he
said it is all cleared up,so I'm good to go.

20:06.486 --> 20:08.391
I think I'm in love with you,Ted.

20:08.421 --> 20:13.543
In the end,I didn't need to wait
three days,but Holly really,really did.

20:13.874 --> 20:17.885
Like a lot of rules,there are times
to follow them and times to not.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.849
But I will tell you this.

20:19.869 --> 20:23.668
When I got your mother's
number,I called her right away.

20:27.057 --> 20:29.453
- Stan!
- Hey,fellas.

20:29.463 --> 20:31.679
- Stan,aren't you working?
- Took the night off.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.403
- That's great! We can all hang out!
- Yeah.

20:33.413 --> 20:35.468
Uh,I can't. Got a date.

20:36.050 --> 20:37.753
- You ready,baby?
- Yup.

20:37.763 --> 20:39.067
What the...

20:39.117 --> 20:42.937
Wait,wait. Couldn't you guys just
stay here and do your date with us?

20:42.947 --> 20:46.225
Yeah,it'll be fun! Look,I'm laughing!

20:46.235 --> 20:48.652
It's fun here! You like magic?

20:48.662 --> 20:52.129
Fellas,it-it's time
we said good-bye.

20:52.160 --> 20:56.802
I mean,we shared a very special afternoon
together,and that's something I will always cherish.

20:56.812 --> 20:59.157
I'll never forget you guys.

20:59.649 --> 21:02.105
- Do you even know their mes?
- No idea. Is the tall one Ted?

21:02.115 --> 21:04.240
No. That's Marshall.
He's married to Lily.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.107
- Okay. You like chicken wings?
- Oh,yeah.
