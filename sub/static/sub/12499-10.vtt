WEBVTT

00:03.219 --> 00:06.221
Have you ever seen a more beautiful sight?

00:06.222 --> 00:08.223
No, I haven't.

00:08.224 --> 00:10.592
I bet it smells like Strawberry Shortcake.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.027
Mmm.

00:12.028 --> 00:14.279
The majestic Philadelphia Eagle.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.229
They're almost extinct, because...
[chainsaw buzzing]

00:16.230 --> 00:18.947
[Gasps] Molloy! What are you doing?

00:18.948 --> 00:21.717
Ooh, I'm sorry, "timber".

00:21.718 --> 00:25.054
You may have just wiped
out an entire species!

00:25.055 --> 00:27.289
You can't just cut down trees
inside of a national...

00:27.290 --> 00:29.391
[Chainsaw buzzing] [Screams]

00:29.392 --> 00:30.899
- [Grunts]
- [Grunts]

00:30.900 --> 00:34.797
[Sniffing] Whoa.
Smells more like strawberry shit-cake.

00:34.798 --> 00:37.318
[Jaunty music]

00:37.801 --> 00:39.702
- [Crunching]
- [Screams]

00:39.703 --> 00:42.103
<i>Brickleberry!</i>

00:44.974 --> 00:47.209
All right, rangers. I've got exciting news.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.276
Oh, let me guess!

00:48.277 --> 00:52.014
Judge Judy is here, and she
buck-ass naked and horny as hell!

00:52.015 --> 00:54.280
No. Today's my birthday.

00:54.281 --> 00:57.452
And tonight's my annual
blow-out party in honor of me!

00:57.453 --> 01:00.455
There will be cake, ice cream, and hookers.

01:00.456 --> 01:01.957
Just like my childhood parties.

01:01.958 --> 01:04.292
Molloy, you worthless son of a bitch!

01:04.293 --> 01:07.162
Hmm, can you speak up? I cunt hear you.

01:07.163 --> 01:10.733
You made the mother eagle fly off, and
these eggs are completely cracked.

01:10.734 --> 01:12.835
Luckily, Connie had duct tape on her.

01:12.836 --> 01:16.438
Come to think of it, why did you
bring duct tape into the forest?

01:16.439 --> 01:17.840
[Laughs nervously] No reason.

01:17.841 --> 01:20.342
Those trees had to go to make
room for Woody's birthday party.

01:20.343 --> 01:22.510
Malloy here is planning the whole thing.

01:22.511 --> 01:27.349
You are jeopardizing an endangered
species for your stupid birthday party?

01:27.350 --> 01:31.153
Hey! All the great leaders throw
themselves extravagant parties.

01:31.154 --> 01:36.024
Hussein, Gaddafi, Kim Jong-il, we all
took a page from Hitler's playbook.

01:36.025 --> 01:39.461
"Self-aggrandizement is how
we reinforce our dominance".

01:39.462 --> 01:41.063
Steve, kiss my ass!

01:41.064 --> 01:43.698
Gladly. Happy Birthday, Sir.

01:43.699 --> 01:45.067
Mwah!

01:45.068 --> 01:47.369
Di... I didn't mean literally!

01:47.370 --> 01:49.731
Ah-ah... but I also didn't say "stop".

01:49.732 --> 01:51.840
- Mwah!
- Ugh, that is so degrading.

01:51.841 --> 01:54.810
Of course it's degrading,
it keeps people in line.

01:54.811 --> 01:57.679
Connie! Wish me Happy Birthday
while you choke yourself!

01:57.680 --> 02:00.182
[Muffled, straining] Happy Birthday, Woody.

02:00.183 --> 02:03.185
- Denzel, you're next.
- Suck my [Bleep], mother[Bleeper].

02:03.186 --> 02:05.520
See, that's...
that's black for "Happy Birthday".

02:05.521 --> 02:08.957
I don't care how many people wish you
Happy Birthday, none of them mean it.

02:08.958 --> 02:12.060
Well, lucky for me, I don't give a shit.
I'd rather be feared than loved.

02:12.061 --> 02:15.197
Well, I don't fear you or love you.
Come on, eggs, let's get out of here.

02:15.198 --> 02:16.265
[Strained breathing]

02:16.266 --> 02:17.465
It keeps them warm!

02:17.466 --> 02:21.436
Huh. I always thought
witches' tits were cold.

02:21.437 --> 02:25.040
I need some fireworks for a birthday party,
and I heard you were the best around.

02:25.041 --> 02:26.675
[Shouting] Huh? What?

02:26.676 --> 02:29.838
Yeah, 20 years in the business
and not one accident!

02:29.839 --> 02:32.747
- You know why?
- Hmm, I'm as stumped as you are.

02:32.748 --> 02:36.828
What? Because I'm all about safety!

02:37.120 --> 02:39.288
[Sizzling] So what you need, huh?

02:39.289 --> 02:43.925
I got bottle rockets, jumping
jacks, m-80s, cocaine.

02:43.926 --> 02:46.862
I'm Firecracker Jim, God damn it! Huh?

02:46.863 --> 02:49.631
No, this is kid stuff.
You have anything bigger?

02:49.632 --> 02:53.712
Hell yeah, I do! Hold on a minute!

02:58.441 --> 03:00.361
Sold.

03:03.046 --> 03:04.412
You know what I miss?

03:04.413 --> 03:07.533
- Uh, fingers?
- Yeah.

03:08.017 --> 03:10.152
All right, people, work faster!

03:10.153 --> 03:14.456
Or work slower, because I kinda
want to break in this bullwhip.

03:14.457 --> 03:15.958
[Gasps]

03:15.959 --> 03:17.757
Wow.

03:17.758 --> 03:18.768
[Nail gun firing]

03:18.769 --> 03:21.830
Ow! Jesus Christ, I look like Jesus Christ!

03:21.831 --> 03:23.966
Sorry, Steve, I got distracted.

03:23.967 --> 03:27.387
I'll go get a nail claw.

03:29.005 --> 03:30.056
Ow!

03:30.057 --> 03:31.202
- Connie!
- Ow...

03:31.203 --> 03:33.242
Stop wasting nails.

03:33.243 --> 03:38.163
Either go for the kill
shot, or knock it off.

03:38.181 --> 03:40.249
I know what's going on.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.884
You like that girl.

03:41.885 --> 03:45.698
Either that, or you planning to murder her.
I can't tell, you got those crazy eyes.

03:45.699 --> 03:48.523
Wow. She's way out of my league.

03:48.524 --> 03:51.293
Don't sell yourself short.
You're just as nasty as she is.

03:51.294 --> 03:54.296
Tell you what, tonight at the party,
I'ma help you get that girl.

03:54.297 --> 03:57.032
- You'd really do that?
- Sure, we're friends.

03:57.033 --> 03:59.866
Now, here's the plan.
At the party, I'll distract her.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.935
- You throw her in your trunk.
- What?

04:01.936 --> 04:04.206
I don't want to kill her,
I want to date her.

04:04.207 --> 04:08.243
Kill her, date her, either way,
she's getting a gash to the face.

04:08.244 --> 04:10.082
What happened to the wildlife fund?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.614
I tried to get cash for an
Incubator, but it was all gone.

04:12.615 --> 04:14.116
Woody said he needed the money.

04:14.117 --> 04:16.418
- For what?
- For that.

04:16.418 --> 04:19.321
Ha ha! I feel like a Pharaoh!

04:19.322 --> 04:22.457
- You look more like a fat-ho.
- Woody, how could you do that?

04:22.458 --> 04:24.927
I am trying to save an endangered species.

04:24.928 --> 04:28.196
Ugh, those eagles are endangered
because they're weak.

04:28.197 --> 04:30.198
And I got no respect for weak!

04:30.199 --> 04:33.049
- Right, Steve?
- Happy Birthday! [Crashing]

04:33.050 --> 04:35.507
Aw, thanks, you weak son of a bitch.

04:35.508 --> 04:39.207
Hey, speaking of bitches, I don't believe
Ethel's wished me a Happy Birthday yet.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.509
- Now say it!
- Screw you!

04:41.510 --> 04:44.579
Okay then, you're on...
administrative leave!

04:44.580 --> 04:47.350
- What the hell does that mean?
- I mean, I am the administrator,

04:47.351 --> 04:49.670
and for you to... well, uh...
[bleeping] Leave!

04:49.671 --> 04:51.619
You are a dick, Woody Johnson.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.956
- Get back to work! [Whip cracking]
- [Screams]

04:53.957 --> 04:56.897
[Overlapping chatter]

04:58.909 --> 05:00.555
[Screaming]

05:00.556 --> 05:02.530
[Glasses clinking]

05:02.531 --> 05:04.433
[Glass and tray clinking]

05:04.434 --> 05:05.867
[Laughing]

05:05.868 --> 05:07.970
Great job on the party, little buddy!

05:07.971 --> 05:09.871
So what's in store for my entertainment?

05:09.872 --> 05:14.076
Well, after the fireworks Denzel
will be performing a magic show.

05:14.077 --> 05:16.211
Magic? I love magic!

05:16.212 --> 05:19.032
[Fireworks booming]

05:19.983 --> 05:23.518
Glorious! Makes me feel
like I'm back in Iraq!

05:23.519 --> 05:25.087
I've gotta go back there one day.

05:25.088 --> 05:28.990
You know I never finished my
necklace made of baby dicks?

05:28.991 --> 05:31.659
Hey, uh, Firecracker Jim,
I think this one's a dud.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.695
Huh? Dud, my ass!

05:33.696 --> 05:38.016
Pour some gasoline on it, it'll light!

05:39.634 --> 05:44.139
I said light the Bengal Fire,
then the Roman Candle, idiot!

05:44.140 --> 05:46.600
I'll do it!

05:50.113 --> 05:52.814
[Fireworks booming]

05:52.815 --> 05:55.553
- Now's your chance!
- Hi. What can I get you?

05:55.554 --> 05:58.520
Let's play little Dutch
Boy who saved Holland.

05:58.521 --> 06:00.655
You can stick your finger in the dyke.

06:00.656 --> 06:02.124
Ugh.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.059
Well, that was a disaster.

06:04.060 --> 06:05.693
Man, I thought that was a solid line.

06:05.694 --> 06:07.562
Took me all night to come up with that.

06:07.563 --> 06:09.264
Don't worry, I got a backup plan.

06:09.265 --> 06:11.735
You gonna help me do a magic trick.
She'll love it!

06:11.736 --> 06:12.934
Magic trick?

06:12.935 --> 06:15.103
Why not? You're both lesbians, right?

06:15.104 --> 06:16.771
Ain't nothing gayer than magic.

06:16.772 --> 06:18.799
When Woody says he doesn't
care about these birds,

06:18.800 --> 06:21.331
what he's really saying is
that he doesn't care about me.

06:21.332 --> 06:24.211
Well, screw him!
Now nothing can keep me here!

06:24.212 --> 06:26.986
Steve, can you be a doll and blow into
this thing so I can start my car?

06:26.987 --> 06:28.216
You're drinking again?

06:28.217 --> 06:29.095
[Laughing nervously]

06:29.096 --> 06:30.618
What? No.

06:30.619 --> 06:32.034
- [Blowing air]
- [Glugging liquor]

06:32.035 --> 06:33.788
[Engine turning over]

06:33.789 --> 06:37.259
Come on, Cousin [Bleepers], let's see the
stuff you were saving for the race war.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.727
[Laughs] We ain't preparin'
for no race war.

06:39.728 --> 06:42.046
Speak for yourself, Bobby, because I am.

06:42.047 --> 06:44.599
He's talking about the
big finale, numbnuts!

06:44.600 --> 06:46.000
This!

06:46.001 --> 06:48.002
Now I'll show you how to
escape from the handcuffs.

06:48.003 --> 06:50.865
Wow. I didn't know you were a magician.

06:50.866 --> 06:54.097
Magician? I ain't no magician.
I'm just black.

06:54.098 --> 06:57.698
Victor, Bravo, Foxtrot, Tango.

07:02.379 --> 07:03.415
[Engine sputtering]

07:03.416 --> 07:05.954
What the... oh, wait, I forgot.

07:05.955 --> 07:08.065
Can you blow into this for us?

07:08.066 --> 07:11.666
[Blowing air] [Engine revving]

07:13.000 --> 07:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:21.204 --> 07:23.004
Ah!

07:31.581 --> 07:34.382
[Gasping] Help! Ethel! Help!

07:34.383 --> 07:36.684
Woody! Grab hold!

07:36.685 --> 07:38.666
Slipping. Give me your other hand!

07:38.667 --> 07:41.089
I can't, just pull harder!

07:41.090 --> 07:43.958
God damn it, who's more important,
me or those [Bleeping] eggs?

07:43.959 --> 07:48.159
- Whoops, you slipped.
- You biiiii...

07:48.764 --> 07:50.864
Iiiii...

07:54.237 --> 07:57.057
You goddamn bitch!

07:58.132 --> 08:02.060
Oh, my God! We're marooned on
an uncharted desert island!

08:02.061 --> 08:04.228
Steve, we're on the hill
by the parking lot.

08:04.229 --> 08:06.264
So, there's...

08:06.265 --> 08:08.223
- There's no smoke monster.
- Damn it.

08:08.224 --> 08:09.495
Oh, just my luck.

08:09.496 --> 08:12.549
The Park goes all Katrina, and
I'm handcuffed to The Superdome.

08:12.550 --> 08:15.768
- No offense.
- We lost the key during the flood.

08:15.769 --> 08:18.516
Where's Woody? He'll know what to do.

08:18.517 --> 08:20.273
Guys, Woody didn't make it.

08:20.274 --> 08:23.776
I did my best to save him,
but I guess he was too weak.

08:23.777 --> 08:28.212
And too stupid, and too assholey,
and, you know, too fat to live.

08:28.213 --> 08:29.858
- Oh, my God!
- That's terrible.

08:29.859 --> 08:31.650
Poor guy. [Splashing]

08:31.651 --> 08:33.285
Malloy, you survived!

08:33.287 --> 08:37.847
Barely. Luckily, I found this pontoon boat.

08:39.058 --> 08:40.294
Anybody hungry?

08:40.296 --> 08:42.561
I'm kidding. She probably has AIDS.

08:42.562 --> 08:44.863
- Woody's dead.
- Oh!

08:44.864 --> 08:45.898
What's for breakfast?

08:45.899 --> 08:48.107
- Aren't you sad at all?
- Yeah, I'm sad.

08:48.108 --> 08:50.937
And how I grieve is by eating breakfast.

08:50.938 --> 08:53.306
What are we gonna do?
We don't have a leader.

08:53.307 --> 08:54.773
Yes, we do.

08:54.774 --> 08:57.276
Woody always said I was second in charge.

08:57.277 --> 08:58.945
Actually, this is what he said.

08:58.946 --> 09:02.148
In the event of my death, I
want Steve to be in charge.

09:02.149 --> 09:03.316
Ha! You're all [Bleeped]!

09:03.317 --> 09:05.751
You heard what he said. I'm the new leader.

09:05.752 --> 09:08.120
We're behind you 100%, Steve.

09:08.121 --> 09:09.488
[Whispering] Ethel, you
can't let this happen!

09:09.489 --> 09:12.091
Relax, Denzel, let Steve play leader.

09:12.092 --> 09:15.127
He couldn't be worse than Woody.
Besides, I need to look after these eggs.

09:15.128 --> 09:19.098
Yes! Trust me, guys, I won't
let it go to my head.

09:19.099 --> 09:22.801
Gather 'round, my people, I
am your new King, Steve!

09:22.802 --> 09:27.106
Together, we will create a new
society called Steveistan! No...

09:27.107 --> 09:28.707
Steveland! That's it.

09:28.708 --> 09:30.676
Now, Stevelanders!

09:30.677 --> 09:34.512
I know you are hungry, so we are
all going to forage for food.

09:34.513 --> 09:38.084
- That sounds like a lot of work.
- The chocolate cowboy is right.

09:38.085 --> 09:40.353
No one makes Jorge forage!

09:40.354 --> 09:42.554
Yeah, maybe we need a new leader!

09:42.555 --> 09:44.991
How about you?
Why, you remind me of a Kennedy.

09:44.992 --> 09:47.726
Only because you're drunk, and I
saw you drowning a woman earlier.

09:47.727 --> 09:49.695
[Chanting] New leader! New leader...

09:49.696 --> 09:52.865
- King Steve sucks!
- Wait, wait, I-I-I was kidding!

09:52.866 --> 09:56.135
No... no one has to work,
just do whatever you want.

09:56.136 --> 09:58.737
- No rules!
- [Cheering]

09:58.738 --> 10:01.907
- Hail to the new regime!
- Rules can suck my ass off!

10:01.908 --> 10:04.843
My people love me!
Wait, what are you doing?

10:04.844 --> 10:07.446
We gonna get naked and touch
our dick-eyes together.

10:07.447 --> 10:10.516
Yep. Ain't no rules against it.

10:10.517 --> 10:14.453
If I had to be handcuffed to anybody,
I'm glad it's you, Denzel.

10:14.454 --> 10:15.687
That's nice, Connie.

10:15.688 --> 10:18.757
And of everybody I've been handcuffed
to, I'd say you in the top ten.

10:18.758 --> 10:19.858
[Stomach rumbles loudly]

10:19.859 --> 10:21.380
Uh-oh.

10:21.381 --> 10:23.571
Do you think there's a
bathroom around here?

10:23.572 --> 10:25.164
Don't even think about it.

10:25.165 --> 10:27.066
I would gnaw right through
my [Bleeping] arm.

10:27.067 --> 10:29.268
- But it hurts!
- Hi, guys.

10:29.269 --> 10:32.211
- Hey, it's Trudy!
- Um... hello.

10:32.212 --> 10:35.841
Hey, you're the girl who used
that dyke-finger line on me.

10:35.842 --> 10:38.677
I just got it. It was hot and clever.

10:38.678 --> 10:40.913
- Really?
- I knew it was gold!

10:40.914 --> 10:43.449
So, uh... you wanna hang out today?

10:43.450 --> 10:45.751
Sure I do! Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

10:45.752 --> 10:49.788
Well, actually I got other plans... hey!

10:49.789 --> 10:51.649
Mmm.

10:53.427 --> 10:55.647
[Slurping]

10:55.662 --> 10:57.882
[Giggling]

11:00.200 --> 11:02.480
[Screaming]

11:12.679 --> 11:14.146
See, citizens?

11:14.147 --> 11:18.717
While you were relaxing on the
beach, your leader has found food.

11:18.718 --> 11:21.358
Help yourselves.

11:21.455 --> 11:23.675
Too sour.

11:23.910 --> 11:26.358
- Ugh, too sweet.
- Too just right!

11:26.359 --> 11:29.895
Guys, we have limited
food, so you may wanna...

11:29.896 --> 11:32.965
I mean, please continue wasting our food!

11:32.966 --> 11:34.666
Whatever makes you happy.

11:34.667 --> 11:38.927
No one tells Jorge how to eat apples!

11:45.078 --> 11:48.947
Connie, I want to hear
more of your florid words.

11:48.948 --> 11:50.549
- Uh...
- [Inaudible whispering]

11:50.550 --> 11:56.388
Even though your face is heinous, I'll
dive into your mouth like Greg Louganis.

11:56.389 --> 11:59.024
- Hell yeah!
- Oh, Connie...

11:59.025 --> 12:01.954
Ooh. Normally, I'm a fan
of pigs in a blanket.

12:01.955 --> 12:02.961
Ah!

12:02.962 --> 12:08.567
It cheers my heart to see my huddled
masses shivering around a dying fire.

12:08.568 --> 12:10.302
We're cold! Ain't no firewood.

12:10.303 --> 12:12.403
But no one wanted to get firewood.

12:12.404 --> 12:13.326
[Chuckling]

12:13.327 --> 12:15.520
Of course no one wanted to get firewood.

12:15.521 --> 12:19.185
That goes against everything
Steveland stands for.

12:19.186 --> 12:20.016
[Gasps]

12:20.017 --> 12:22.014
Oh, God! They're hatching!

12:22.015 --> 12:24.983
The only two known Philadelphia
eagles in existence.

12:24.984 --> 12:28.454
Push! Push, you little orphan bastards!

12:28.455 --> 12:29.563
- [Hatchlings chirping]
- [Gasping]

12:29.564 --> 12:31.823
I'm a mother! Oh!

12:31.824 --> 12:36.362
And my parents said it would never happen
after I played hide the rolling pin.

12:36.363 --> 12:38.096
I was a curious child.

12:38.097 --> 12:41.400
Great news, everyone.
I found a rowboat washed up on the beach.

12:41.401 --> 12:43.538
That's great, Steve, we're saved!

12:43.539 --> 12:46.738
Hell yeah we are!
I chopped it up into 100 pieces.

12:46.739 --> 12:48.440
Now we'll have firewood for months!

12:48.441 --> 12:50.543
[Cheering]

12:50.544 --> 12:53.045
Hooray for short-term solutions!

12:53.046 --> 12:56.382
I only wish Woody could see me now.

12:56.383 --> 12:59.023
Wherever he is.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.427
Is anyone out there?

13:08.428 --> 13:09.732
Hello?

13:09.733 --> 13:11.463
Hello?

13:11.464 --> 13:14.366
Please, I can't be alone with my thoughts.

13:14.367 --> 13:16.101
I hate my thoughts!

13:16.102 --> 13:17.869
Everyone hates you.

13:17.870 --> 13:19.971
You deserve to die alone.

13:19.972 --> 13:22.552
Who said that?

13:23.210 --> 13:25.611
You're not real, damn you!

13:25.612 --> 13:27.379
[Tearfully] You're not real.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.148
We're gonna drive you crazy.

13:30.149 --> 13:31.988
Crazy...

13:31.989 --> 13:33.819
Crazy...

13:33.820 --> 13:35.980
[Screams]

13:37.990 --> 13:39.610
- What was that?
- [Gasps]

13:39.611 --> 13:41.156
It's the smoke monster.

13:41.157 --> 13:46.126
You know, they really prefer
to be called African-American.

13:46.127 --> 13:48.028
Will the defendant please rise?

13:48.029 --> 13:49.729
Done, baby!

13:49.730 --> 13:51.432
Oh! Oh yeah, right there.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.818
Yeah baby, I'm all up
in the Judge's chamber!

13:53.819 --> 13:54.836
[Snores]

13:54.837 --> 13:57.938
- Oh, yeah, that's how I like it...
- I know you do!

13:57.939 --> 13:58.972
[Screams]

13:58.973 --> 14:00.474
It's okay, it's me.

14:00.475 --> 14:02.142
I know it's you, that's why I'm screaming!

14:02.143 --> 14:06.080
All this time I spent with Connie, it
was your words I fell in love with.

14:06.081 --> 14:09.483
- What's going on here?
- Call me, lover.

14:09.484 --> 14:12.553
- Denzel, how could you?
- How could I? She raped me!

14:12.554 --> 14:13.735
Liar!

14:13.736 --> 14:17.204
She was the one person in the world
that liked me, and you ruined it!

14:17.205 --> 14:18.905
I never want to see you again!

14:18.906 --> 14:20.840
Connie, listen to reason.

14:20.841 --> 14:23.677
At least flip me over,
you're road-rashing my dong!

14:23.678 --> 14:27.038
Eat up, my little babies.

14:27.911 --> 14:31.238
You need to grow big and strong
to re-populate the species,

14:31.239 --> 14:33.627
because even though you're
brother and sister today,

14:33.628 --> 14:36.697
the day will come when I will
force you to be husband and wife.

14:36.698 --> 14:41.348
- No shame in that.
- No shame in that at all.

14:41.349 --> 14:43.950
Hey, leader! Uh, we're starving!

14:43.951 --> 14:46.152
Yeah, and this here's the last apple.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.854
Ugh! Too applely.

14:47.855 --> 14:49.856
It's your job to feed us, King dickhead.

14:49.857 --> 14:52.592
Yeah, King dickhead! Feed us!

14:52.593 --> 14:54.294
Wait, am I still the leader?

14:54.295 --> 14:56.196
I say we eat him.

14:56.197 --> 14:59.766
He looks plump and juicy,
like a Thanksgiving rooster!

14:59.767 --> 15:01.901
Hey, hey! Hold on, fellas.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.237
Cannibalism is illegal and immoral.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.873
But, on the other hand, there
are no rules in Steveland.

15:06.874 --> 15:07.984
[Indistinct angry shouting]

15:07.985 --> 15:10.644
No one panic. I have an idea.

15:10.645 --> 15:13.846
We'll just take the rowboat to
civilization, and get some food.

15:13.847 --> 15:16.349
Steve, you idiot.
You chopped up the rowboat.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.318
Okay, I have another idea.

15:18.319 --> 15:20.353
It better not involve a time machine.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.232
I have a third idea!

15:22.233 --> 15:24.277
What? No!

15:24.278 --> 15:26.059
You can't eat my birds!

15:26.060 --> 15:28.504
[Chuckling] No, you misunderstood me.

15:28.505 --> 15:31.864
I'm not gonna eat your birds,
I'm gonna feed your birds...

15:31.865 --> 15:32.899
To people.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.168
There's no way in hell!
These are my babies!

15:35.169 --> 15:36.703
Oh, come on!

15:36.704 --> 15:39.806
That's like saying adopted
kids are people's babies.

15:39.807 --> 15:43.076
They're just homeless children
people raise to have sex with.

15:43.077 --> 15:44.344
[Indistinct angry shouting]

15:44.345 --> 15:46.979
Enough yip-yap, time to
pluck 'em and [Bleep] 'em.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.837
Uh, I-I mean, eat 'em.

15:48.838 --> 15:51.284
Denzel, we're meant to be together.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.619
We're soul mates!

15:52.620 --> 15:54.287
Look, girl, we ain't happening.

15:54.288 --> 15:56.456
Although it is pretty
cool I flipped a lesbian.

15:56.457 --> 15:59.792
Trudy, he's not that much of a catch.
He hits women.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.228
What? I would never!

16:01.229 --> 16:02.794
[Grunts, bursts into tears]

16:02.795 --> 16:05.031
Connie, that's messed... oh!

16:05.032 --> 16:07.200
Don't make me... ow!

16:07.201 --> 16:08.301
See how you like it.

16:08.302 --> 16:09.946
[Grunting, straining]

16:09.947 --> 16:10.803
[Panting]

16:10.804 --> 16:12.272
Damn.

16:12.273 --> 16:13.306
Ow!

16:13.307 --> 16:16.042
[Baby eagles chirping]

16:16.043 --> 16:18.545
So, Steve came through, huh?

16:18.546 --> 16:21.620
Hey, here's a thought, what if we
didn't give in to our impulses today,

16:21.621 --> 16:23.816
and waited until these birds had eggs?

16:23.817 --> 16:25.566
Then we'd never run out of food.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.186
Boo! Boo!

16:27.187 --> 16:32.435
You're right, you're right, there will
always be endangered birds to eat.

16:32.436 --> 16:34.020
An entire species wiped out,

16:34.021 --> 16:37.029
just because Steve is too much of
a pussy to stand up to anyone.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.865
Maybe I should have saved Woody's life.

16:38.866 --> 16:40.933
Woody? He's not dead.

16:40.934 --> 16:42.630
He's on the other side of
the island going crazy,

16:42.631 --> 16:44.738
- like Tom Hanks in that movie.
- Cast away?

16:44.739 --> 16:46.973
No, the one where he thinks
Julia Roberts is attractive.

16:46.974 --> 16:48.808
Did I just do a Charlie Wilson's war joke?

16:48.809 --> 16:52.349
You're goddamn right I did!

16:56.241 --> 16:57.241
Woody?

16:57.242 --> 17:00.182
[Laughing maniacally]

17:00.679 --> 17:02.079
Woody is dead.

17:02.080 --> 17:05.875
The whispers have named me
Second Lieutenant Leakycheeks!

17:05.876 --> 17:07.075
[Laughing maniacally]

17:07.076 --> 17:10.020
Whoa. You are nuttier than squirrel shit.

17:10.021 --> 17:11.858
I have never felt more alive.

17:11.858 --> 17:12.883
[Shouting] Leakycheeks!

17:12.884 --> 17:15.259
All thanks to the whispers.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.861
You're welcome. Now head-butt that tree.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.198
- All right. [Grunts]
- Why did you do that?

17:20.199 --> 17:22.400
<i>Peanut butter with Jim Belushi.</i>

17:22.401 --> 17:26.637
Okay. Here's the thing, psycho.
We need you back.

17:26.637 --> 17:28.839
Steve has taken charge,
and everything's a mess.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.875
- They're gonna eat my eagles.
- [Shouting] Chinese werewolves!

17:31.876 --> 17:35.112
Oh, you can't be serious, you
used to love abusing power!

17:35.113 --> 17:39.577
I have found love. [Laughing] Whee!
Love, I'm surrounded by love!

17:39.578 --> 17:41.752
I got Mr. Crabby and Rock-Rock.

17:41.753 --> 17:43.354
[Flies buzzing]

17:43.355 --> 17:45.889
And the whispers.
[Shouting] I love you, whispers!

17:45.890 --> 17:48.125
Screw you. Pull your hair out.

17:48.126 --> 17:48.985
[Screams]

17:48.986 --> 17:51.461
I'm happy here. [Laughing maniacally]

17:51.462 --> 17:55.681
Fine. Good-bye, Lieutenant Cheeks.
If you see Woody, tell him Happy Birthday.

17:55.682 --> 17:58.436
Aw, you don't have to say
that shit to Woody anymore.

17:58.437 --> 17:59.927
His tyrant days are over.

17:59.928 --> 18:03.313
I'm not saying it because I have to,
I'm saying it because I want to.

18:03.314 --> 18:06.313
Yes, he was a cruel,
inconsiderate, racist ass wipe.

18:06.314 --> 18:09.228
But deep down, I considered him to be...

18:09.229 --> 18:11.988
Almost not a complete
lowlife piece of shit.

18:11.989 --> 18:15.024
Wow. That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

18:15.025 --> 18:16.693
I know what you're thinking, Woody.

18:16.694 --> 18:18.861
Don't do it.

18:18.862 --> 18:21.598
It's no use, whispers! I'm a born leader!

18:21.599 --> 18:24.111
And born leaders help their annoying, P.C.,

18:24.112 --> 18:25.794
holier-than-thou co-workers.

18:25.795 --> 18:27.504
Woody, come on.

18:27.505 --> 18:31.208
Indian burn your ball sack one last time.

18:31.209 --> 18:33.489
Don't go.

18:33.911 --> 18:35.378
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

18:35.379 --> 18:37.314
[Chanting] We want eagle!

18:37.315 --> 18:39.115
We want eagle!

18:39.116 --> 18:41.084
We want eagle!

18:41.085 --> 18:45.345
Do what you do best, Mr. Possum-Gods!

18:45.623 --> 18:48.625
Hey! No one touches those birds.

18:48.626 --> 18:50.560
Woody? You're alive!

18:50.561 --> 18:53.027
Back down, Steve. I'm running the show now.

18:53.028 --> 18:54.340
Yes, Sir!

18:54.341 --> 18:56.766
Now, just one minute. Steve is our leader.

18:56.767 --> 18:59.302
And we like it that way because,
well, we can walk all over him.

18:59.303 --> 19:00.903
Yeah, we want Steve!

19:00.904 --> 19:02.405
Really guys, it's... it's fine.

19:02.406 --> 19:06.088
Well, that's great, but if anyone wants
to challenge the leader, we all know...

19:06.089 --> 19:08.644
[Shouting] They must fight to the death!

19:08.645 --> 19:09.751
Where are you getting that?

19:09.752 --> 19:11.661
You wrote it in the Steveland constitution.

19:11.662 --> 19:14.457
- Damn it!
- Woody, kill.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.786
Sounds good to me, whispers!

19:16.787 --> 19:18.677
[Grunts]

19:18.678 --> 19:23.958
[Chanting] Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight...

19:26.597 --> 19:27.664
[Pinecones crunching]

19:27.665 --> 19:30.300
- Go get 'em, Steve!
- I'm rooting for Woody.

19:30.301 --> 19:33.212
- All right. Go get 'em, Woody!
- I'm rooting for Steve.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.739
That does it! I told you what
happened, and you don't believe me.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.574
Save it, Denzel.

19:37.575 --> 19:39.809
Trudy was the one person
I could have loved.

19:39.810 --> 19:42.379
She was beautiful, she was kind...

19:42.380 --> 19:43.311
I raped him.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.794
- See?
- And I have chlamydia.

19:44.795 --> 19:46.285
See, I told you... w-w-w-what?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.854
Oh, my God, what an awful skank!

19:48.855 --> 19:50.956
I should have believed you.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.724
I'm sorry she gave you chlamydia.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.894
Nah, don't worry.
I gave her something way worse.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.995
A baby.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.832
[Grunts]

20:00.833 --> 20:04.002
- I'll kill him later.
- All: All hail Woody!

20:04.003 --> 20:06.371
Okay, Woody. So you're the new leader.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.739
It doesn't matter, we're
still gonna starve to death.

20:08.740 --> 20:10.509
[Shipboard bell ringing]
You people need a lift?

20:10.510 --> 20:14.110
You see, Steve? We're saved.

20:18.361 --> 20:21.061
[Eagle screeches]

20:21.888 --> 20:25.123
Time for my babies to leave the nest.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.858
I appreciate you coming with me, Woody.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.461
Well, I can't say I care
about these little suckers.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.729
But you do.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.030
And that's good enough for me.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.932
Soar!

20:33.933 --> 20:35.601
I was wrong, Ethel.

20:35.602 --> 20:39.104
Maybe they are strong enough to survive.

20:39.105 --> 20:42.585
I'm Firecracker Jim, God...

20:43.109 --> 20:45.544
[Laughing loudly]

20:45.545 --> 20:47.645
Or not.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.275
[Wailing]

20:52.352 --> 20:54.019
[Typewriter clacking]

20:54.020 --> 20:55.351
[Carriage return dinging]
