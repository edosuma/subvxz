01:37.547 --> 01:40.047
I think I got something.

01:47.932 --> 01:51.310
- What'd you find?
- Looks Iike a cooking pot.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.770
Could possibly be
Apalachee Indian.

01:53.771 --> 01:55.147
It is, Iook at the water symbol.

01:55.148 --> 01:56.857
- That's Apalachee.
- Right.

01:56.858 --> 01:59.318
- This some kind of test?
- You just passed it.

01:59.319 --> 02:02.446
We should be able to take the Iady
and the kid without any trouble.

02:02.447 --> 02:04.197
- What if he acts up?
- What's the matter,

02:04.198 --> 02:06.788
you can't handle a teenager?

02:11.998 --> 02:14.583
- It's nice here, isn't it?
- I Iove it.

02:14.584 --> 02:17.169
Pete and I came down here once
before you were born.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.671
We spent a week in New Orleans
and then ate our way

02:19.672 --> 02:22.549
through the Cajun Country.
We had a wonderful time.

02:22.550 --> 02:26.136
- Mom, can we not talk about him?
- Michael, he's your father.

02:26.137 --> 02:27.888
Pete Thornton was
a part-time father.

02:27.889 --> 02:33.499
And you don't have to defend him.
You divorced him, remember?

02:36.272 --> 02:38.356
Look, I know it's childish,

02:38.357 --> 02:41.026
but when he didn't show up for
my high school graduation, it hurt.

02:41.027 --> 02:42.694
It was his work, Michael.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.529
He was always using that
for an excuse.

02:44.530 --> 02:49.260
Look, he promised me
he'd be there, and he wasn't.

02:50.369 --> 02:52.869
What was that?

02:54.373 --> 02:56.541
Who are you? What's going on here?
Who are you?

02:56.542 --> 02:57.917
- What do you want?
- Come here!

02:57.918 --> 03:00.461
- What are you doing?
- Move them closer together.

03:00.462 --> 03:03.047
- Get away from her!
- Stand still, tough guy.

03:03.048 --> 03:06.217
- What do you want?
- Let go of her!

03:06.218 --> 03:09.345
- Let her up! You're hurting her!
- No, no!

03:09.346 --> 03:11.139
- Come on!
- Mom. Mom!

03:11.140 --> 03:13.933
- Okay, now hold her there.
- Look at the camera.

03:13.934 --> 03:15.810
- Oh, please!
- Smile, Iady.

03:15.811 --> 03:19.564
- We're gonna make you a star.
- PIease, what do you want?

03:19.565 --> 03:22.483
It's a nightmare. That's my family.

03:22.484 --> 03:24.360
And it's all because of me,
I'm sure of that.

03:24.361 --> 03:26.237
Do you have any idea
who these guys are?

03:26.238 --> 03:28.739
No, the message is
a computer printout.

03:28.740 --> 03:31.117
No marks, no prints,
no way to trace it.

03:31.118 --> 03:33.786
- Real professional.
- What about the videotape?

03:33.787 --> 03:39.083
I've had experts go over it. Nothing.
No, all these kidnappers want is me.

03:39.084 --> 03:40.626
The message begins with me flying

03:40.627 --> 03:43.421
into Sherman Parish Airport,
Louisiana, tomorrow morning.

03:43.422 --> 03:46.591
And I'II just bet they want you
arriving without company.

03:46.592 --> 03:50.482
Yeah, or else Connie
and Michael are dead.

03:51.263 --> 03:54.348
- Well, I guess I got a plane to catch.
- What?

03:54.349 --> 03:56.600
Well, I figure I should get to Louisiana
before you do

03:56.601 --> 03:59.979
- so they don't connect us.
- I can't ask you to help on this one.

03:59.980 --> 04:02.480
So don't ask.

04:14.286 --> 04:16.411
Frank. You surprised me.

04:16.413 --> 04:19.833
Surprise kills. Remember that.

04:27.757 --> 04:29.591
It's all arranged.

04:29.592 --> 04:32.344
You'II pick up Thornton
in the morning.

04:32.345 --> 04:33.721
I'm counting on you.

04:33.722 --> 04:37.482
- Don't worry.
- Don't underestimate him.

04:37.517 --> 04:40.017
Failure is betrayal.

04:50.989 --> 04:55.033
Welcome to my small slice
of the world, Connie. Michael.

04:55.034 --> 04:57.534
Who are you?

04:58.830 --> 05:00.747
I'm an old friend of your father's.

05:00.748 --> 05:05.544
I've been Iooking forward
to our meeting one day, Connie.

05:05.545 --> 05:08.045
What do you want from us?

05:10.675 --> 05:14.261
I wanna see the Iight of happiness
in your eyes.

05:14.262 --> 05:17.472
And then I wanna watch
that Iight go out.

05:17.473 --> 05:20.393
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

05:20.560 --> 05:22.227
Who do you think
arranged for the grant

05:22.228 --> 05:24.771
that brought you both down here?

05:24.772 --> 05:27.190
That's right.

05:27.191 --> 05:30.570
You're bait, to attract your husband

05:30.736 --> 05:33.614
and your father, Peter Thornton.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.158
My plane got into Louisiana
three hours

05:37.159 --> 05:39.369
before Pete Thornton was due.

05:39.370 --> 05:43.700
Gave me time to rent a bike
and to get a map.

05:44.417 --> 05:47.544
Pete was scheduled
to arrive right about now.

05:47.545 --> 05:52.257
He'd been instructed to hire a cab
and proceed to Parish Road, M- 12,

05:52.258 --> 05:55.760
a dirt road
right in the middle of nowhere.

05:55.761 --> 05:58.096
As soon as he was contacted
by the kidnappers,

05:58.097 --> 06:01.349
we planned to activate
our communication system.

06:01.350 --> 06:05.144
He was wearing one of those
ultramodern watches:

06:05.145 --> 06:09.941
Tells time, reads the date
and sends out a radio signal.

06:09.942 --> 06:11.859
I had the receiver.

06:11.860 --> 06:14.822
So I could be out of sight...

06:15.406 --> 06:17.906
...but not out of touch.

06:46.019 --> 06:48.688
You sure this is
where you want Iet off, mister?

06:48.689 --> 06:51.189
Yeah, thanks.

07:30.397 --> 07:32.897
Get in, Mr. Thornton.

07:37.404 --> 07:39.904
You're right on time.

07:44.786 --> 07:49.786
- I wanna know if my family's all right.
- No talking.

08:29.205 --> 08:33.115
I had to stay in radio range
or lose him.

08:35.544 --> 08:38.755
Sometimes the best way to follow
a car without being spotted

08:38.756 --> 08:41.091
is not to follow at all.

08:41.092 --> 08:46.072
Especially when you have
a transmitter working for you.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.293
Empty wagon parked
in the middle of Bayou country

09:17.294 --> 09:21.839
with nobody around
gave rise to very strong notion:

09:21.840 --> 09:24.467
They planned a vehicle switch.

09:24.468 --> 09:29.918
Figured I should hang around
to see which road they'd take.

09:59.878 --> 10:02.380
Out. This is where
we switch transportation.

10:02.381 --> 10:04.173
So, what's this all about?

10:04.174 --> 10:06.050
Simple.

10:06.051 --> 10:07.843
I don't trust you.

10:07.844 --> 10:12.264
Now get your clothes off.
Everything you got on.

10:13.016 --> 10:14.934
What's the matter,
you think I'm wired?

10:14.935 --> 10:18.005
You're wasting time, Mr. Thornton.

10:18.230 --> 10:20.730
Whatever you say.

10:21.525 --> 10:24.235
- Everything?
- AII of it. Your shoes and your socks,

10:24.236 --> 10:26.028
jewellery, the whole bit.

10:26.029 --> 10:28.489
Hey, what about my money
and personal papers?

10:28.490 --> 10:32.034
And I thought it was your family
you were worried about.

10:32.035 --> 10:34.745
AII right, you made your point.

10:34.746 --> 10:37.246
Just hurry it up.

11:12.367 --> 11:17.067
It's a good thing
we don't have a plane to catch.

11:22.919 --> 11:25.462
Thornton, we don't have all day.

11:25.463 --> 11:28.799
Listen, anybody could come driving
down the road here. I'm a Iittle shy.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.803
Do you mind if I finish
dressing over there?

11:32.804 --> 11:35.304
Long as we watch.

11:36.349 --> 11:38.849
Sure.

12:06.712 --> 12:10.131
- You guys are really nervous.
- We're careful.

12:10.132 --> 12:13.092
You know, if you really think I'm wired,
you should check everything.

12:13.093 --> 12:16.137
I could have a microtransistor
in my shirt buttons.

12:16.138 --> 12:19.474
- Come on, move it.
- Maybe I've got radioactive toenails.

12:19.475 --> 12:20.975
Maybe we ought to pull them out.

12:20.976 --> 12:23.561
You wanna start something out here
in front of God and everybody,

12:23.562 --> 12:25.730
- go right ahead. Push it.
- Knock it off!

12:25.731 --> 12:28.316
Come on, get those clothes on.
We're running Iate.

12:28.317 --> 12:31.694
Oh, we're on a schedule?
Where we going?

12:31.695 --> 12:36.282
You'II find out when we get there.
Just keep moving.

12:36.283 --> 12:41.413
You're starting to get on my nerves.
Will you hurry up?

12:54.092 --> 12:56.677
You don't really think I'd risk
having someone follow me, do you?

12:56.678 --> 12:58.512
Maybe. Maybe not.

12:58.513 --> 13:02.903
This way we have nothing
to worry about, do we?

13:07.314 --> 13:09.690
Now what?

13:09.691 --> 13:12.191
Step right in.

13:14.446 --> 13:17.323
Don't you have something to finish?

13:17.324 --> 13:20.409
AII right, get moving.
You can keep the cash.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.910
Burn everything else.

15:23.699 --> 15:26.827
- Morning.
- Keep your mouth shut.

16:04.114 --> 16:06.616
The signal was getting stronger,

16:06.617 --> 16:12.227
which meant the vehicle was
coming back toward me in a hurry.

16:23.425 --> 16:26.219
Nobody in it but the driver.

16:32.559 --> 16:36.270
They had Pete,
and I had no way of tracking him.

16:36.271 --> 16:42.671
All I could do was time my ride
and estimate where they were let off.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.263
Excuse me.

17:15.351 --> 17:17.935
You wouldn't happen to have seen
a couple of guys come by here-- ?

17:17.936 --> 17:21.232
No, I ain't seen nothing.

17:21.398 --> 17:23.898
And I'm busy.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.948
What kind of flies you use,
if you don't mind my asking?

17:29.949 --> 17:32.577
My own. Ties them myself.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.287
Well, as Iong as they work.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.198
- You fish?
- When I have time.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.962
What do you pull out of here
besides catfish?

17:43.963 --> 17:47.758
- Any bass or crappie?
- Bass, for sure.

17:48.384 --> 17:50.635
My name's Obadiah Moss.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.471
MacGyver. I'd sure Iike to try this,

17:53.472 --> 17:56.099
but I'm Iooking
for a friend right now.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.643
Guy may have come by here
about ten, 12 minutes ago

17:58.644 --> 18:01.605
- with a couple of other fellows.
- Your friend bald?

18:01.606 --> 18:04.316
- Kind of on the hefty side?
- That's Pete.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.907
Well, I might have seen him.

18:08.654 --> 18:12.994
I'd sure appreciate
anything you could tell me.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.043
They got into a skiff
and headed upriver.

18:24.044 --> 18:26.004
Any idea where they
might be headed?

18:26.005 --> 18:28.298
Into the swamp.

18:28.299 --> 18:30.258
About 800 mile of it.

18:30.259 --> 18:33.428
Bayous, shallows,
gators and snakes.

18:33.429 --> 18:37.307
- Sounds Iike a great place to get Iost.
- For sure.

18:37.308 --> 18:41.978
Excepting this bayou runs
straight up four mile, then she splits.

18:41.979 --> 18:45.481
You take the right channel,
she take you right to Gator Camp.

18:45.482 --> 18:46.816
Can't miss it.

18:46.817 --> 18:49.402
Big old branch in the water
with a tire nailed on it.

18:49.403 --> 18:51.529
And you think that could
be where they're going?

18:51.530 --> 18:53.197
Ain't no "could be."

18:53.198 --> 18:56.367
Gator Camp only dry Iand
for 60 mile.

18:56.368 --> 19:02.058
Them old boys with your friend?
I spied them there, week back.

19:02.249 --> 19:05.835
Didn't care to stop and chat
with them then, neither.

19:05.836 --> 19:10.146
Yep, they sound Iike the guys
I'm Iooking for.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.174
I'm grateful.

19:12.175 --> 19:14.176
My pleasure, sir.

19:14.177 --> 19:17.179
Fishermen's got to help each other.

19:17.180 --> 19:20.684
Besides, your friend...

19:21.101 --> 19:23.436
...he didn't Iook real happy.

19:23.437 --> 19:25.937
Yeah, that figures.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.318
Listen, Obadiah, I'd sure try
and make you a good deal

19:31.319 --> 19:33.946
- if you'd rent me your boat.
- Ain't worth too much.

19:33.947 --> 19:37.825
Engine, she's Iiable to just up
and stop on you.

19:37.826 --> 19:40.326
I'II risk it.

19:43.540 --> 19:46.584
- How much further?
- Relax, enjoy the view.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.253
I'm worried about my family.
Do you mind?

19:49.254 --> 19:52.048
They're fine so far.

20:03.893 --> 20:07.863
- Thanks a Iot.
- Take care, now, you hear?

20:34.007 --> 20:36.883
Riverhead One to Gator Camp.
Do you read me?

20:36.884 --> 20:39.261
I read you, Riverhead One.

20:39.262 --> 20:42.097
- Go on.
- There's a man following Thornton,

20:42.098 --> 20:43.724
name of MacGyver.

20:43.725 --> 20:46.602
MacGyver. Of course.

20:46.769 --> 20:48.603
Pete would bring MacGyver.

20:48.604 --> 20:50.689
I sent him upriver in my skiff.

20:50.690 --> 20:52.858
He should reach the tire
on the branch in the river

20:52.859 --> 20:55.778
at approximately 1100 hours.

20:56.445 --> 20:59.115
Good, very good. Come on up.

20:59.282 --> 21:02.032
You can help us bury MacGyver.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.160
MacGyver.

21:11.460 --> 21:15.714
Obadiah started out by saying
he hadn't seen anything.

21:15.715 --> 21:19.050
But for someone who didn't seem
to wanna get involved,

21:19.051 --> 21:21.261
he sure wasn't too shy
about telling me

21:21.262 --> 21:23.805
exactly where
Pete would be headed.

21:23.806 --> 21:28.436
Right for that old tire
nailed to the big branch.

21:32.398 --> 21:39.068
- SIow down, we're getting there.
- Don't worry yourself. I know the way.

21:59.091 --> 22:03.721
- Where are they?
- They're Iocked up in the back.

22:06.098 --> 22:08.598
Oh, Pete, thank God.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.229
Michael, you--

22:13.230 --> 22:15.930
- You both all right?
- Yeah.

22:16.024 --> 22:18.025
Have you any idea
who's behind this?

22:18.026 --> 22:20.779
It's been a Iong time, Peter.

22:22.281 --> 22:24.031
Frank Bonner.

22:24.032 --> 22:25.741
I thought you were dead.

22:25.742 --> 22:28.242
Surprise.

22:28.245 --> 22:31.205
- You do know him.
- We worked together once.

22:31.206 --> 22:33.165
As I said,
we go back a Iong way, Michael.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.334
Back into shadows and darkness.

22:35.335 --> 22:37.753
- Right, Peter?
- Whatever happened,

22:37.754 --> 22:41.382
whatever you think happened,
that's between you and me,

22:41.383 --> 22:43.092
not my family. Let them go.

22:43.093 --> 22:47.003
I can't.
Not until we all hear the truth.

22:47.430 --> 22:50.500
And then I will extract payment...

22:50.767 --> 22:53.267
...in full!

22:54.938 --> 22:57.438
What's he talking about?

22:58.608 --> 23:01.108
I don't know.

23:01.194 --> 23:05.214
He's brought me here
for some crazy reason.

23:05.824 --> 23:07.408
And he's dragged you two into it.

23:07.409 --> 23:11.879
- He hates you, doesn't he?
- He thinks he does.

23:13.081 --> 23:15.581
Connie, I'm sorry.

23:16.709 --> 23:21.839
I always used to say,
"You have such interesting friends."

23:21.840 --> 23:25.008
Obadiah said he tied
his own flies,

23:25.009 --> 23:28.804
but the ones I saw stuck in his hat
were store-bought.

23:28.805 --> 23:32.849
Made me start thinking about
the directions he gave me.

23:32.850 --> 23:35.560
He didn't want me to get lost...

23:35.561 --> 23:39.211
...but maybe he wanted
me to get found.

23:39.232 --> 23:40.732
Well, I didn't wanna disappoint

23:40.733 --> 23:44.093
whoever was gonna be
looking for me.

23:51.744 --> 23:54.788
He said he was a mercenary.
Who is he?

23:54.789 --> 23:57.666
He was one of our top agents
until he went sour.

23:57.667 --> 24:00.585
We all had to deal in violence,
but he enjoyed it.

24:00.586 --> 24:02.504
How many other men
have you seen besides him?

24:02.505 --> 24:04.172
Three. The three who grabbed us.

24:04.173 --> 24:05.966
Have you notified the FBI
or the police?

24:05.967 --> 24:09.135
No, I couldn't risk that.
But I have got help coming.

24:09.136 --> 24:11.596
MacGyver, he's a good friend.
You remember him.

24:11.597 --> 24:15.016
One guy? I thought with your work,
you have a million connections.

24:15.017 --> 24:16.935
They gave me instructions, Michael.

24:16.936 --> 24:20.522
If I had an army follow me in here,
they'd arrive and find us all dead.

24:20.523 --> 24:25.694
- MacGyver is the best I know.
- Yeah, but he's still only one man.

24:25.695 --> 24:28.739
Come out. Move!

24:31.200 --> 24:34.536
Somebody once told me that when
you're alone in enemy territory,

24:34.537 --> 24:40.067
you have to stay low, stay careful
and make a moving target.

24:40.084 --> 24:42.584
So I made one.

24:49.301 --> 24:52.512
When it comes to art,
I'm no expert.

24:52.513 --> 24:55.013
But I know what I like.

25:10.322 --> 25:13.442
Corey! Frank gave us a Iittle job.

25:13.575 --> 25:17.045
Stay close,
you might Iearn something.

25:35.263 --> 25:38.057
Peter, I'd Iike your opinion
on a matter of tactics:

25:38.058 --> 25:39.934
The use of a backup man.

25:39.935 --> 25:42.561
Boone failed to pick him up,
but you failed too.

25:42.562 --> 25:44.605
What's the matter?
Did you forget the importance

25:44.606 --> 25:47.191
of a secondary Iine of defence?

25:47.192 --> 25:49.318
Your man's good.

25:49.319 --> 25:51.445
But he's not perfect.

25:51.446 --> 25:55.146
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:55.951 --> 25:58.451
MacGyver.

26:00.121 --> 26:02.164
Dunn, come in.

26:02.165 --> 26:07.115
I can hear his motor.
Figure maybe another 30 seconds.

26:16.846 --> 26:20.140
- You sure it's the same dude?
- No question about it.

26:20.141 --> 26:22.641
That's Obadiah's boat.

26:27.690 --> 26:31.440
He's dead,
and he doesn't even know it.

26:49.796 --> 26:51.171
Hey, Frank.

26:51.172 --> 26:54.292
That sound you heard?
We got him.

26:56.177 --> 26:59.931
Message received. Return to base...

27:00.431 --> 27:05.191
...and we'II go on
with our next piece of business.

27:05.603 --> 27:08.103
Back in the room.

27:16.781 --> 27:19.282
Well, the alligators ought
to be happy. Free Iunch.

27:19.283 --> 27:22.702
Look, just make sure they don't
Ieave anything.

27:22.703 --> 27:26.933
- Don't worry.
- I'm going back to the cabin.

27:32.546 --> 27:36.424
It was pretty obvious that Obadiah
had sold me down the river,

27:36.425 --> 27:41.262
so I wasn't too upset that I hadn't
given him a deposit on his boat.

27:41.263 --> 27:46.153
I figured I'd just shell out
a bonus to his buddies.

28:32.230 --> 28:34.231
Hey, wish me Iuck.

28:34.232 --> 28:39.892
Because if I don't make it back,
you could retire right here.

28:40.364 --> 28:42.865
- Look, we can't just sit here.
- We wait.

28:42.866 --> 28:46.702
We heard an explosion, that's all.
MacGyver is damn hard to kill.

28:46.703 --> 28:48.788
Oh, come on. He's dead. Face it.

28:48.789 --> 28:50.790
If we're gonna do anything,
we have to do it now.

28:50.791 --> 28:53.209
- Michael, Iisten!
- Look, we're in here because of you!

28:53.210 --> 28:56.670
And now you're gambling Mom's
Iife on one miracle man. He's dead!

28:56.671 --> 29:00.431
- Temper, temper.
- And to hell with you.

29:05.138 --> 29:07.638
Stop--

29:07.933 --> 29:09.975
I can ice him, Frank.

29:09.976 --> 29:11.310
No!

29:11.311 --> 29:15.065
No, not that way,
and not that quickly.

29:15.482 --> 29:17.982
No.

29:18.109 --> 29:23.197
And you, Michael, if you ever
raise your voice to me again...

29:23.198 --> 29:24.782
...I'II cut your tongue out.

29:24.783 --> 29:27.117
Why can't you just tell us
what you want?

29:27.118 --> 29:30.037
- He wants revenge.
- I want justice.

29:30.038 --> 29:34.082
- What are you talking about?
- Your husband...

29:34.083 --> 29:37.670
...killed my wife and my son.

30:03.905 --> 30:06.364
This your courtroom, Frank?

30:06.365 --> 30:12.925
You sit in that chair over there.
I want your family to hear the truth.

30:17.418 --> 30:22.839
Three and a half years ago in Yemen,
I was Pete's point man in the field.

30:22.840 --> 30:26.426
And I moved my wife
and my son there to Iive.

30:26.427 --> 30:29.512
- Well, that was your choice.
- You said it was under control.

30:29.513 --> 30:31.348
It was when we started.

30:31.349 --> 30:34.726
Three other agents moved their
families there to Iive too, remember?

30:34.727 --> 30:37.227
Safety factor was fine.

30:37.229 --> 30:40.139
You know what went wrong, Frank.

30:50.451 --> 30:53.787
Corey, give me the pliers.

30:55.497 --> 30:57.997
Come on!

31:01.879 --> 31:03.921
We were sent there
to keep the peace,

31:03.922 --> 31:09.312
and we ended up in the middle
of a tribal war, didn't we?

31:10.929 --> 31:15.809
And that's when you ran out
on me and my family.

31:16.685 --> 31:19.604
Have you ever explained any of this
to your wife and your son?

31:19.605 --> 31:21.647
Everything about that operation
was classified

31:21.648 --> 31:25.776
until a couple of months ago.
I couldn't explain anything...

31:25.777 --> 31:28.277
...not even to my family.

31:32.159 --> 31:34.659
What about my wife?

31:34.661 --> 31:37.161
And my son?

31:38.749 --> 31:41.125
What I had was a donkey engine,

31:41.126 --> 31:44.587
which got its name
because it works like a mule.

31:44.588 --> 31:47.598
And I had a fair amount of rope.

31:50.927 --> 31:52.845
By attaching the rope
to the engine,

31:52.846 --> 31:55.306
I could create an awful lot
of pulling power,

31:55.307 --> 31:59.977
the kind of power that would
hopefully get Pete and his family out.

31:59.978 --> 32:02.521
But I had one little problem:

32:02.522 --> 32:05.816
I had to start the engine
while I was up close to the house,

32:05.817 --> 32:08.612
which was about 50 feet away.

32:14.117 --> 32:17.536
Sometimes the only way
you can solve a problem

32:17.537 --> 32:20.467
is to be in two places at once.

32:20.832 --> 32:23.334
By splicing a piece of wire
into the rope

32:23.335 --> 32:26.128
and then connecting it
to the ignition switch,

32:26.129 --> 32:28.505
I had just what I needed:

32:28.506 --> 32:31.217
A long-distance starter cord.

32:45.023 --> 32:47.983
Frank's wife and son
got caught in a guerrilla raid.

32:47.984 --> 32:49.693
Like the rest of us.

32:49.694 --> 32:51.695
The only difference was
they got caught alone

32:51.696 --> 32:53.572
because you weren't there
to protect them.

32:53.573 --> 32:55.240
I was in the field.

32:55.241 --> 32:59.244
I sent them to you for safety,
and you ran out on them.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.580
That's what you've been
telling yourself for three years?

33:01.581 --> 33:03.248
- That's what happened.
- What happened

33:03.249 --> 33:07.252
to the almost $800,000 you
were given to buy us information?

33:07.253 --> 33:10.630
- So we could make the right moves?
- Don't change the subject.

33:10.631 --> 33:13.967
Oh, that is the subject, Frank,
because you never contacted anybody.

33:13.968 --> 33:16.845
You never recruited anybody,
you never paid anybody.

33:16.846 --> 33:20.473
You faked intelligence reports,
and you kept the money.

33:20.474 --> 33:24.603
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You embezzled agency funds, Frank!

33:24.604 --> 33:27.772
So that when the Sharit attacked,
we had no warning. Not a clue!

33:27.773 --> 33:30.400
Shut up! You're Iying now,
just Iike you did then.

33:30.401 --> 33:33.069
Oh, you sent your wife
and your son to me, sure!

33:33.070 --> 33:35.739
- And you weren't there.
- But it wasn't for their safety, was it?

33:35.740 --> 33:37.240
It was so they'd be out of the way

33:37.241 --> 33:39.284
while you shipped out the money
you'd stolen!

33:39.285 --> 33:41.619
- You weren't there!
- No, because I got hit

33:41.620 --> 33:43.663
in the attack
you didn't warn us about.

33:43.664 --> 33:45.915
The same attack
that killed your family.

33:45.916 --> 33:49.252
No! You're responsible
for their death.

33:49.253 --> 33:52.006
And payment will be made.

35:01.658 --> 35:06.998
You're the one who's paying, Frank.
And it's killing you.

35:09.624 --> 35:11.959
You can't Iay your guilt on me.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.810
It doesn't work, it won't fit.

35:14.838 --> 35:17.756
Look, what happened was terrible.

35:17.757 --> 35:20.843
And you're gonna have to Iive
with that your whole Iife,

35:20.844 --> 35:23.805
but doing this isn't gonna help.

35:25.015 --> 35:27.766
For God's sake, Frank,
we were friends once.

35:27.767 --> 35:30.267
Friends?

35:31.521 --> 35:34.021
That's good, Peter.

35:34.107 --> 35:35.691
But not good enough.

35:35.692 --> 35:40.322
There will be a death.
There will be an execution.

35:40.697 --> 35:43.197
No.

35:43.616 --> 35:47.396
Oh, I wouldn't dream
of killing him now.

35:47.704 --> 35:50.984
I want him to Iearn something first.

35:51.624 --> 35:54.501
I want him to see his son dead.

35:54.502 --> 35:57.002
Like I saw mine.

35:57.338 --> 35:59.838
Dad.

36:01.426 --> 36:02.968
In order for my plan to work,

36:02.969 --> 36:06.555
I had to get the bad guys
out of the house.

36:06.556 --> 36:10.416
To do that, I had to get
their attention.

36:15.898 --> 36:20.208
This can of gas should
do the trick just fine.

36:20.653 --> 36:24.303
An oil-soaked rag
makes a perfect fuse.

36:24.574 --> 36:30.124
It'll burn slow, so I can get away
before I blow myself up.

36:42.508 --> 36:45.008
It's very hard, I know.

36:46.095 --> 36:49.665
But don't blame me,
blame your father.

36:49.682 --> 36:55.182
Now, I want you to stand up.
Let's go outside very quietly.

36:55.938 --> 37:01.468
- Lock them up in the room, quick!
- Come on, come on, move!

37:09.493 --> 37:13.753
- What's happening?
- It's got to be MacGyver.

37:23.716 --> 37:25.299
- Come on!
- Go!

37:25.300 --> 37:27.343
Head that way!

37:27.344 --> 37:29.844
I'II distract them.

37:35.561 --> 37:37.979
Come on!

37:37.980 --> 37:40.730
Don't even think about moving.

37:43.819 --> 37:45.903
There's nothing we can do right now.
Come on.

37:45.904 --> 37:47.655
But Mom--

37:47.656 --> 37:50.032
If we can get away,
we can come back.

37:50.033 --> 37:52.533
Now, come on.

38:00.335 --> 38:02.002
Where's the boy?

38:02.003 --> 38:04.715
Where is he? Find the boy.

38:04.881 --> 38:07.381
Find him!

38:09.052 --> 38:11.763
AII right, move. Move it!

38:17.853 --> 38:20.353
Stay close.

38:29.197 --> 38:31.697
I think we Iost them.

38:33.535 --> 38:36.035
Get down.

38:36.371 --> 38:40.374
- Don't sweat it, we'II find them.
- I want that MacGyver.

38:40.375 --> 38:44.415
I don't know how
he got past me Iast time.

38:48.842 --> 38:52.345
- Hi, name's MacGyver.
- I know.

38:52.512 --> 38:54.263
So, what are we gonna do?

38:54.264 --> 38:56.598
The guy Bonner's crazy.
He could kill my mom and Pete.

38:56.599 --> 38:58.725
No, not while they're still out
hunting for us.

38:58.726 --> 39:01.520
We got time.
You know what methane is?

39:01.521 --> 39:02.854
- Swamp gas.
- Yeah.

39:02.855 --> 39:05.065
I'm no chemist,
but I know it stinks and it burns.

39:05.066 --> 39:07.442
It also explodes when it's confined.

39:07.443 --> 39:11.905
So if we put some swamp gas
in a container, we got a Iittle bomb.

39:11.906 --> 39:14.241
And for containers...

39:14.242 --> 39:16.535
Bamboo? To make bombs?

39:16.536 --> 39:20.914
You bet. It's hollow,
and it's got its own built-in plugs.

39:20.915 --> 39:26.003
So start cutting some Iengths
about 3 to 4 feet.

39:26.170 --> 39:29.370
Then we'II start our own fireworks.

39:32.802 --> 39:35.303
I thought he was Corey.
He was wearing Corey's fatigues.

39:35.304 --> 39:39.225
He took Corey out. And you.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.434
You didn't find him.

39:41.435 --> 39:43.770
It'II be dark soon, Frank,
we'II nail them in the morning.

39:43.771 --> 39:45.563
Sure, all we gotta do is wait.

39:45.564 --> 39:48.108
Oh, is that your expert opinion?

39:48.109 --> 39:50.068
Then you take the first watch.

39:50.069 --> 39:52.569
Go on, get out of here!

39:58.786 --> 40:01.121
Methane's Iighter than gas,
so it rises,

40:01.122 --> 40:04.374
pushes the air out of
the bamboo piece until it's full of gas.

40:04.375 --> 40:09.585
- Well, how do you know when it's full?
- Use your nose.

40:14.093 --> 40:15.927
It's full.

40:15.928 --> 40:18.428
This is the tricky part.

40:40.410 --> 40:42.910
AII right.

40:43.247 --> 40:45.331
AII right, there she is.

40:45.332 --> 40:48.293
Loaded, armed and fused.

40:48.502 --> 40:51.504
What if you're wrong? I mean,
methane's supposed to burn, but--

40:51.505 --> 40:57.665
You're right. So, what do you say
we try a Iittle field test, huh?

41:03.266 --> 41:07.236
- My God, it might work.
- Yeah. It better.

41:12.109 --> 41:14.819
Pete's a really good friend
of yours, isn't he?

41:14.820 --> 41:17.196
The best.

41:17.197 --> 41:19.198
You call him Pete, huh?

41:19.199 --> 41:22.576
Yeah, I guess that's the way I think
of him. He was never very close,

41:22.577 --> 41:24.870
not much of a father.

41:24.871 --> 41:27.122
Yeah, well, he's made some
mistakes, that's for sure.

41:27.123 --> 41:29.500
He's not perfect.

41:29.501 --> 41:32.628
- But he tried, didn't he?
- Yeah, I'II give him that.

41:32.629 --> 41:36.256
It's just that he never
Iet me get close.

41:36.257 --> 41:38.717
And I just found out why
he missed my graduation.

41:38.718 --> 41:40.094
He had a good reason,

41:40.095 --> 41:43.138
it's just that he never explained it
to me, he never Iet me understand.

41:43.139 --> 41:46.100
- It was classified. He couldn't.
- That was three years ago.

41:46.101 --> 41:49.645
And two of his men were held hostage
for 31 months of that three years.

41:49.646 --> 41:52.523
- He couldn't say anything.
- He couldn't explain that?

41:52.524 --> 41:56.985
Are you kidding me?
He took an oath. He Iives by that.

41:56.986 --> 42:00.280
He wanted to tell you,
when they were finally freed.

42:00.281 --> 42:02.866
About five months back, remember?
You wouldn't see him.

42:02.867 --> 42:04.618
I was busy. I...

42:04.619 --> 42:07.469
I didn't wanna get in a fight.

42:07.872 --> 42:11.750
I guess I was afraid
of being angry or hurt.

42:11.751 --> 42:13.919
I don't know. I just...

42:13.920 --> 42:15.212
I don't understand him.

42:15.213 --> 42:19.132
Yeah, well, he doesn't
understand you very well either.

42:19.133 --> 42:21.633
But he sure Ioves you.

42:22.887 --> 42:25.389
When do you graduate
from college?

42:25.390 --> 42:28.893
- In two years, why?
- Invite him.

42:29.435 --> 42:32.685
I can guarantee you he'II be there.

42:33.356 --> 42:35.856
It's over, Frank.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.610
MacGyver's clear.

42:38.611 --> 42:41.404
He'II be back tomorrow,
and he won't be alone.

42:41.405 --> 42:42.614
Wrong.

42:42.615 --> 42:45.909
The only way out of here's by boat,
and we've got that covered.

42:45.910 --> 42:51.410
Double-check it. And see
that Dunn's on his toes out there.

42:52.333 --> 42:57.093
If this sours, if I Iose the boy,
the rules change.

42:57.505 --> 42:59.964
Connie first...

42:59.965 --> 43:02.465
...then you.

43:14.647 --> 43:17.147
MacGyver! Find him!

43:25.157 --> 43:28.197
Let's go, outside. Come on, move!

43:28.744 --> 43:32.039
Mike. Come on. We gotta hustle.

43:47.137 --> 43:50.807
They're out there. They got Dunn.

43:50.974 --> 43:54.784
Well, we'II give them
something to watch.

43:56.730 --> 43:59.230
Shoot her!

44:02.569 --> 44:05.069
Shoot her!

44:06.490 --> 44:08.990
No!

44:18.043 --> 44:20.543
Stay here.

44:21.713 --> 44:24.213
They're throwing bombs.

44:25.008 --> 44:29.848
- Where the hell did they get them?
- How do I know?

44:29.888 --> 44:32.638
Look out! There's another one!

45:21.481 --> 45:23.981
Michael, no!

45:25.651 --> 45:28.445
- He was gonna kill you.
- That's what he is,

45:28.446 --> 45:30.946
not what we are, son.

45:31.282 --> 45:35.832
Listen to your father, Mike.
You know he's right.

45:57.475 --> 46:00.477
I call this my Cajun cuisine special:

46:00.478 --> 46:02.687
Bayou-burned blackened redfish.

46:02.688 --> 46:05.190
Don't tell me you picked that up
while down in New Orleans?

46:05.191 --> 46:06.608
I flew in early, remember?

46:06.609 --> 46:10.153
I had time enough to collect
a few recipes, pass the time.

46:10.154 --> 46:12.614
Are you sure you're supposed
to add that much Tabasco?

46:12.615 --> 46:16.493
- Trust me, Connie, trust me.
- Come on, Mom, Iive dangerously.

46:16.494 --> 46:19.747
Speaking of which, he said subtly...

46:20.414 --> 46:23.208
...how would you Iike to go to
the Lakers game tomorrow night?

46:23.209 --> 46:26.669
Are you all of a sudden
playing dad, Dad?

46:26.670 --> 46:29.170
Yeah, I am.

46:29.173 --> 46:32.053
In that case, it'd be terrific.

46:32.468 --> 46:34.968
Great.

46:36.055 --> 46:39.390
Listen, maybe we could all go out
and have a bite afterwards?

46:39.391 --> 46:41.142
No, Pete, thanks.

46:41.143 --> 46:43.603
You two have a Iot to catch up on.

46:43.604 --> 46:47.190
You know, Connie,
for what it's worth, I...

46:47.191 --> 46:49.691
I'm really proud of you.

46:50.027 --> 46:51.778
And now, Iadies and gentlemen,

46:51.779 --> 46:56.709
the infamous MacGyver's
Bayou-burned blackened redfish.

47:16.928 --> 47:19.428
Whoops.

47:21.725 --> 47:25.985
What do you say we send out
for cheeseburgers?

47:26.305 --> 47:32.577
