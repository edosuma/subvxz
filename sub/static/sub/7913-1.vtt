01:29.356 --> 01:32.154
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.

01:32.559 --> 01:34.254
Theres no ether, either.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.987
Jesus Christ.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.263
You there! Is this the last one?

01:46.576 --> 01:48.100
God, what a mess.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.277
At least theres no gangrene.

01:51.817 --> 01:54.217
There will be if it doesn't come off soon.

01:54.386 --> 01:57.253
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.

01:58.858 --> 02:00.018
I'm sorry.

02:01.595 --> 02:04.564
Lets coffee up. He can wait a few more minutes.

03:17.755 --> 03:18.881
God!

04:46.396 --> 04:47.328
Glass.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.930
- Is that Tuckers men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.

04:53.505 --> 04:55.166
How long has it been like this?

04:55.340 --> 04:59.140
We found em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.422
Is that you, Lieutenant?

05:14.965 --> 05:16.523
Sons of bitches.

05:19.804 --> 05:22.534
Come on. You better take cover.

05:23.942 --> 05:27.378
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover.

05:28.147 --> 05:29.512
There you go.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.323
You went to the hospital?

05:40.095 --> 05:41.528
It was no good.

05:45.235 --> 05:46.930
What's going on here?

05:47.404 --> 05:49.065
What's going on here?

05:49.407 --> 05:52.001
That seems to be the question, all right.

05:52.877 --> 05:54.902
See, you could ask the major...

05:55.848 --> 05:57.281
...but he don't know.

05:57.449 --> 05:58.677
He's busy.

05:58.885 --> 06:01.581
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers mess...

06:01.788 --> 06:03.722
...run out of peach ice cream.

06:04.492 --> 06:06.483
Then, of course, you got the general.

06:06.927 --> 06:08.792
He come up to see the show.

06:08.997 --> 06:10.931
All he knows is there ain't no show...

06:11.166 --> 06:14.101
...which ain't entirely correct
cause we started a balloon up...

06:14.270 --> 06:16.864
...but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

06:17.074 --> 06:20.566
Nobodys made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

06:22.847 --> 06:25.645
Now, the major, he's looking at the general.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.946
He's thinking to himself,
I better do something.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.622
You know what that means.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.818
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.461
They're supposed to be beat up just like us.

06:38.801 --> 06:42.032
Hell, everybody knows
Tuckers men are tough as cobs.

06:42.604 --> 06:46.267
So far, the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows.

06:47.678 --> 06:49.475
Course, thats about to change.

06:54.586 --> 06:56.213
You son of a bitch.

06:57.790 --> 07:01.590
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight...

07:02.963 --> 07:05.693
...we could just settle
this whole business with a little...

07:05.867 --> 07:07.562
...high-stakes poker.

07:07.769 --> 07:09.600
Wouldnt that be a sight?

07:09.772 --> 07:13.139
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field...

07:13.275 --> 07:14.469
...drawing cards.

07:23.956 --> 07:25.423
What is it, sir?

07:25.557 --> 07:26.922
Looks like a suicide.

07:27.827 --> 07:28.919
Tucker!

07:41.611 --> 07:43.101
What's he doing?

08:09.945 --> 08:12.914
- What did you say to him?
- I didnt say nothing.

08:37.312 --> 08:39.143
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

08:41.717 --> 08:44.550
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.

08:48.392 --> 08:49.757
Forgive me, Father.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.491
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!

09:31.211 --> 09:33.236
- Ready!
- I got him.

11:17.641 --> 11:18.767
Don't...

11:21.346 --> 11:22.870
Don't take off my foot.

11:23.481 --> 11:26.177
You rest easy, son. Youll keep your foot.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.186
With God as my judge, youll keep it.

11:34.362 --> 11:36.387
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

11:37.031 --> 11:39.761
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

11:41.503 --> 11:44.233
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

12:11.907 --> 12:14.341
The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.

12:14.478 --> 12:16.139
In trying to produce my own death...

12:16.313 --> 12:19.009
...I was elevated to the status of a living hero.

12:19.217 --> 12:20.980
I was also awarded Cisco...

12:21.152 --> 12:24.019
...the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.

12:24.223 --> 12:28.057
And on full recovery,
was given transfer to any station I desired.

12:28.394 --> 12:32.057
The bloody slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hayes.

12:32.233 --> 12:36.864
A tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie.

13:34.876 --> 13:36.138
Lieutenant.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.329
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

14:00.473 --> 14:01.963
Down at the end of the hall.

14:02.176 --> 14:03.404
Thank you.

14:12.888 --> 14:15.083
Lt. John J. Dunbar.

14:20.031 --> 14:21.828
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

14:22.433 --> 14:24.526
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

14:25.904 --> 14:27.565
Indian fighter.

14:28.708 --> 14:29.766
Excuse me?

14:29.976 --> 14:32.410
It says here that youre
to be posted on the frontier.

14:32.545 --> 14:33.807
The frontier is Indian country.

14:34.015 --> 14:36.415
I quickly deduced that youre an Indian fighter.

14:36.550 --> 14:39.075
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

14:39.287 --> 14:41.084
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

14:46.129 --> 14:49.292
It says here that youve been decorated.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.660
Yes, sir.

14:53.338 --> 14:55.533
And they sent you here to be posted?

14:55.708 --> 14:58.302
Actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.

14:58.477 --> 15:00.206
Really? Why?

15:01.348 --> 15:03.873
I've always wanted to see the frontier.

15:04.217 --> 15:05.980
You want to see the frontier?

15:06.988 --> 15:08.148
Yes, sir.

15:08.556 --> 15:09.648
Before it's gone.

15:16.566 --> 15:19.160
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.

15:25.844 --> 15:26.902
Sir...

15:27.547 --> 15:28.673
...Knight.

15:30.283 --> 15:32.774
I am sending you on a knights errand.

15:34.388 --> 15:36.379
You will report to Captain Cargill...

15:37.158 --> 15:39.456
...at the furthermost outpost of the realm...

15:40.195 --> 15:41.628
...Fort Sedgewick.

15:43.733 --> 15:46.793
My personal seal will assure your safety...

15:47.504 --> 15:50.473
...through many miles
of wild and hostile country.

16:00.487 --> 16:02.352
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

16:03.491 --> 16:06.551
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?

16:07.629 --> 16:09.256
You think I don't know?

16:09.431 --> 16:11.365
- No, sir.
- You think that.

16:11.533 --> 16:13.626
- It's just that I don't know...
- Hold your tongue.

16:13.836 --> 16:16.327
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

16:16.473 --> 16:18.441
See that peasant out there?

16:18.876 --> 16:20.366
He calls himself Timmons.

16:20.511 --> 16:24.345
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

16:25.016 --> 16:28.008
He knows the way. Thank you. That is all.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.131
Sir Knight?

16:46.075 --> 16:48.202
I've just pissed in my pants...

16:50.381 --> 16:52.781
...and nobody can do anything about it.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.892
To your journey!

17:13.976 --> 17:15.375
To my journey!

17:33.200 --> 17:34.258
Haw!

17:36.805 --> 17:38.773
Over a little bit, Jim!

17:41.544 --> 17:43.102
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.110
I'll have my crown now.

17:46.583 --> 17:49.347
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

17:51.289 --> 17:53.621
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

17:53.825 --> 17:56.157
I said I'll have my crown right now!

17:56.328 --> 17:57.317
Now!

18:01.701 --> 18:02.565
No.

18:04.305 --> 18:05.966
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

18:16.319 --> 18:17.183
Sir?

18:19.089 --> 18:20.113
Major?

18:24.829 --> 18:26.353
The king is dead.

18:31.271 --> 18:32.898
Long live the king.

18:57.035 --> 18:59.299
Get these kids out of here, come on!

19:15.024 --> 19:16.582
Haw, Jim and Jake!

19:21.199 --> 19:23.167
Gee a little bit, Jim!

21:04.058 --> 21:05.286
The hell was that?

21:06.794 --> 21:08.159
What is that?

21:14.003 --> 21:15.698
What the hell is that?

21:41.036 --> 21:43.402
Why don't you put that in your book?

21:53.218 --> 21:54.651
Were it not for my companion...

21:54.786 --> 21:57.311
...I believe I would be having the time of my life.

21:57.523 --> 21:58.820
I know he means well...

21:58.991 --> 22:02.119
...but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met.

22:37.138 --> 22:39.072
How far you make the Fort?

22:39.608 --> 22:40.540
Far.

22:43.679 --> 22:44.611
How far?

22:45.716 --> 22:47.547
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

22:48.518 --> 22:50.748
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

22:51.723 --> 22:53.350
It's to be my post.

22:54.760 --> 22:55.886
My home.

23:01.368 --> 23:03.768
You ain't hard to please, I'll give you that much.

23:09.177 --> 23:10.508
Look yonder.

23:22.027 --> 23:23.619
What you got there?

23:35.043 --> 23:38.206
Somebody back east is saying,
Why don't she write?

23:40.783 --> 23:42.375
You stupid bastard.

24:58.210 --> 24:59.700
Get up, Timmons.

25:03.650 --> 25:04.742
Get up.

25:18.469 --> 25:19.333
Get up.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.128
Come on. Get up.

25:25.944 --> 25:28.139
Get up!

25:34.121 --> 25:36.919
Someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?

25:37.358 --> 25:38.655
Goddamn it!

25:41.197 --> 25:42.892
I'm gonna have a welt.

26:57.690 --> 26:59.157
Cpl. Guest?

27:12.441 --> 27:15.035
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

27:36.403 --> 27:37.597
It's the end.

27:39.174 --> 27:41.870
Assemble the men in front of my quarters.

27:52.190 --> 27:53.487
You hate me.

27:55.494 --> 27:57.894
But I feel none of the same for you.

27:59.833 --> 28:01.232
You men stayed.

28:04.005 --> 28:06.735
You stayed after they took all our horses.

28:09.077 --> 28:11.477
You stayed after all the others deserted.

28:13.516 --> 28:16.485
You stayed after the army failed to resupply us.

28:20.424 --> 28:23.188
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes...

28:23.495 --> 28:24.860
...just as you have...

28:25.397 --> 28:27.262
...day after miserable day.

28:30.570 --> 28:33.061
And all I can say is that I'm proud of you.

28:35.109 --> 28:38.237
Now get your things, men.
Were leaving this place.

28:39.247 --> 28:40.839
The army can go to hell.

28:45.221 --> 28:46.085
Go.

28:46.489 --> 28:47.956
Get your things.

29:27.639 --> 29:30.073
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

29:30.577 --> 29:32.545
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

29:33.113 --> 29:35.946
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.

29:36.117 --> 29:39.348
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore.

29:42.792 --> 29:44.020
What about Indians?

29:44.227 --> 29:46.491
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

29:46.997 --> 29:50.433
You just as soon not see em
unless the bastards are dead.

29:50.601 --> 29:52.967
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.

29:53.271 --> 29:54.670
Ho, up there!

31:23.815 --> 31:27.376
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

31:32.259 --> 31:33.453
Go down there.

31:33.660 --> 31:36.595
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

31:38.132 --> 31:39.292
Go down there.

31:44.474 --> 31:46.066
There, son of a bitch!

32:12.675 --> 32:14.540
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

32:35.369 --> 32:37.599
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

32:42.511 --> 32:43.773
Lieutenant!

32:45.414 --> 32:47.439
Everybodys run off or got killed.

33:05.906 --> 33:09.000
All right. Lets unload the wagon.

33:09.811 --> 33:12.041
What? What, and leave it all here?

33:13.750 --> 33:15.274
I'm staying, too.

33:15.918 --> 33:17.715
There ain't nothing here.

33:18.489 --> 33:20.821
No, not at the moment.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.289
We don't know what's happened.

33:25.764 --> 33:27.629
Things being as they are...

33:28.534 --> 33:31.526
...we might as well
just turn around and get headed back.

33:31.805 --> 33:32.999
This is my post.

33:33.206 --> 33:34.366
This is my post?

33:34.641 --> 33:36.131
This is my post.

33:38.212 --> 33:39.372
This is my post?

33:39.782 --> 33:41.113
Jesus H. Christ.

33:41.283 --> 33:42.841
What, are you crazy, boy?

33:46.489 --> 33:48.184
Fast son of a bitch.

33:48.993 --> 33:51.052
- Jesus H. Christ.
- This is my post.

33:51.262 --> 33:52.627
All right, put it down.

33:52.763 --> 33:56.392
And these are the post provisions, all right?
Now get your ass off the wagon...

33:56.568 --> 33:58.593
- Put it down!
- And help me unload.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.365
Were just havin a conversation,
now put it down.

34:52.637 --> 34:54.867
I'll let them know where you are.

34:55.639 --> 34:56.629
Good.

34:59.311 --> 35:00.437
Good luck.

35:02.749 --> 35:03.841
Thank you.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.721
Jake and Jim!

35:21.138 --> 35:22.537
Good mule!

35:23.542 --> 35:24.702
Haw up there now!

35:54.980 --> 35:56.242
Good mules!

36:15.671 --> 36:18.401
Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick deserted.

36:18.609 --> 36:22.306
Am now waiting for garrisons return
or word from headquarters.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.573
The post is in exceedingly poor condition...

36:24.749 --> 36:28.583
...and I have decided to assign myself
clean-up duty beginning tomorrow.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.514
Supplies are abundant...

36:30.690 --> 36:33.386
...and the country
is everything I dreamed it would be.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.188
There can be no place like this on Earth.

38:35.376 --> 38:36.604
Bad horse.

38:37.478 --> 38:38.706
Bad horse.

41:45.942 --> 41:48.274
The animals in the pond
had not been poisoned.

41:48.479 --> 41:50.037
They had all been shot.

41:50.214 --> 41:52.409
But why? Was it for sport?

41:53.018 --> 41:55.077
Could it have been out of spite?

41:55.286 --> 41:58.153
My first guess would have been
that the men here were starving.

41:58.357 --> 42:01.224
But this rotting waste speaks to the contrary.

42:01.695 --> 42:04.129
The caves are an even bigger mystery.

42:04.331 --> 42:07.027
What could have driven men to live in caves?

42:07.235 --> 42:09.066
Perhaps they were frightened.

42:09.237 --> 42:11.797
Maybe there had been some sort of revolt.

42:12.274 --> 42:15.334
I can make no sense of the clues left me here.

42:15.612 --> 42:16.579
Perhaps my relief will provide the answers.

42:27.959 --> 42:29.927
Come on, Cisco. One more time.

42:30.096 --> 42:31.188
Git up!

42:32.398 --> 42:34.195
Come on! Git up, Cisco.

42:37.906 --> 42:38.998
Git up!

42:40.442 --> 42:41.704
Git up! There you go!

42:42.311 --> 42:43.141
Easy.

43:20.624 --> 43:26.928
Only a white man would make a fire
for everyone to see.

43:27.900 --> 43:30.391
Maybe theres more than one.

43:30.603 --> 43:33.071
There might be three or four.

43:34.007 --> 43:35.474
I know three or four...

43:35.676 --> 43:38.042
...who will not be making the trip back home.

43:38.212 --> 43:41.147
We have nothing to show for this trail.

43:42.651 --> 43:44.312
We have no rifles.

43:44.487 --> 43:46.580
White men are sure to have rifles.

43:48.091 --> 43:51.720
It's hard to say how many might be down there.

43:58.938 --> 44:01.338
We should forget this and go home.

44:01.974 --> 44:03.271
Then go.

44:04.178 --> 44:06.043
I would rather die...

44:06.246 --> 44:09.909
...than argue about a single line of smoke
in my own country.

44:20.665 --> 44:24.101
He will not quit until we are all dead.

44:38.086 --> 44:39.576
And if I...

45:47.370 --> 45:48.803
Look at me.

45:57.449 --> 45:59.417
Don't hurt my mules.

46:05.326 --> 46:06.452
Stop.

46:06.860 --> 46:07.724
Stop it.

46:32.726 --> 46:34.717
Please don't hurt my mules.

47:33.333 --> 47:35.460
I am pleased with my efforts thus far.

47:35.636 --> 47:40.096
For all my improvements, though,
there remains an ugliness here I cannot dispel.

47:40.308 --> 47:44.677
An injury that goes beyond neglect
and like a bruise, it will be slow to heal.

48:39.915 --> 48:41.780
It's been almost 30 days.

48:42.017 --> 48:45.475
I have come to enjoy
the patterns of my life at Fort Sedgewick.

48:45.655 --> 48:48.624
Especially my daily
reconnaissance rides with Cisco.

48:49.593 --> 48:52.460
Each day, we go further into the prairie
and every discovery...

48:52.663 --> 48:55.928
...big or small,
becomes etched in my mind forever.

48:56.568 --> 49:00.060
It would seem I've been marooned,
as no one has yet come for me.

49:00.173 --> 49:04.337
I can only assume that there is a problem,
which the army will solve shortly.

49:04.778 --> 49:07.474
Maybe I am being foolish in my optimism...

49:08.116 --> 49:10.380
...but when I look to the eastern horizon...

49:10.685 --> 49:13.813
...I never fail to hope
that a column might be out there.

49:21.632 --> 49:24.362
Still no sign of Capt. Cargills command.

49:24.736 --> 49:27.204
Though well-supplied,
I've decided to ration my goods...

49:27.406 --> 49:30.773
...as if I were part
of a post instead of the whole affair.

49:32.078 --> 49:35.479
Theres a wolf who seems intent
on the goings-on here.

49:36.083 --> 49:39.018
He does not seem inclined
to be a nuisance, however.

49:39.221 --> 49:42.190
And aside from Cisco,
has been my only company.

49:42.491 --> 49:45.688
He's appeared
each afternoon for the past two days.

49:46.028 --> 49:48.019
He has two milky white paws.

49:49.466 --> 49:51.491
If he comes calling tomorrow...

49:51.803 --> 49:53.828
...I will name him Two-Socks.

51:45.775 --> 51:48.107
Almost a month and no one has come.

51:48.579 --> 51:50.206
The longer this condition persists...

51:50.381 --> 51:53.373
...the less inclined I am
to believe that anyone will.

51:53.752 --> 51:56.687
Rain has forced me indoors
for most of two days now...

51:56.856 --> 51:58.949
...and I have begun work on an awning.

52:03.630 --> 52:05.655
It is the loneliest of times for me now...

52:05.833 --> 52:08.859
...but I can say honestly
that I am not unhappy.

52:57.362 --> 53:01.264
How can I marry a pretty little girl

53:01.434 --> 53:03.800
When I got no coat to put on?

53:04.939 --> 53:06.600
Soldier, soldier

53:06.774 --> 53:08.537
Wont you marry me

53:08.944 --> 53:11.139
Before the fight comes home?

53:11.780 --> 53:14.749
How can I marry a pretty little girl

53:15.418 --> 53:17.682
When I got no shoes to put on?

53:33.039 --> 53:36.031
How can I marry a pretty little girl

53:36.644 --> 53:38.839
When I got no hat to put on?

54:02.709 --> 54:05.507
Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me

54:05.746 --> 54:07.941
Before the fight comes home?

54:08.283 --> 54:10.877
How can I marry an ugly little girl

54:11.620 --> 54:13.485
When I got a pretty wife back home?

55:14.464 --> 55:15.692
You there!

55:59.085 --> 56:01.645
Have made first contact with a wild Indian.

56:01.821 --> 56:04.881
One came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse.

56:05.125 --> 56:07.719
When I appeared,
he became frightened and ran off.

56:08.630 --> 56:12.657
Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands.

56:12.868 --> 56:15.860
Keeping only the barest necessities for myself.

56:21.345 --> 56:24.610
My afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols...

56:24.782 --> 56:26.875
...always keeping the post in sight.

56:27.853 --> 56:30.981
Am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.

56:31.224 --> 56:33.658
Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity...

56:33.827 --> 56:37.228
...but am assuming that where there is one
theres sure to be another.

56:40.102 --> 56:43.037
Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion...

56:43.205 --> 56:44.968
...of strength and stability.

56:46.275 --> 56:49.733
I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon...

56:49.913 --> 56:50.140
...all may be lost.

57:07.468 --> 57:11.495
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days.

57:13.142 --> 57:17.135
I do not like to see our medicine man
walking so alone.

57:19.583 --> 57:21.744
What does his wife say?

57:21.919 --> 57:24.547
She says that he is keeping to himself.

57:24.823 --> 57:27.155
Thats not what I asked you.

57:27.325 --> 57:28.849
Well, what did you ask me?

57:29.028 --> 57:31.019
What did she say?

57:31.164 --> 57:34.292
She said that he is keeping
to himself these days.

57:35.669 --> 57:37.534
Thats what she says.

57:39.207 --> 57:41.869
Make sure that my meat is soft.

57:42.044 --> 57:44.308
My teeth hurt.

57:54.525 --> 57:56.493
May I come in?

58:07.708 --> 58:12.077
No, let him sit with me.

58:16.619 --> 58:20.055
Our country seems good this summer...

58:20.224 --> 58:24.558
...but I have not been out to see it.

58:25.930 --> 58:29.422
But the buffalo are late.

58:29.635 --> 58:33.127
And I always worry
about the bellies of our children.

58:36.177 --> 58:38.805
I was thinking of a dance.

58:39.013 --> 58:42.710
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

58:42.885 --> 58:48.017
It would be good to have a strong sign.

59:02.776 --> 59:05.870
Theres a funny thing about signs.

59:06.013 --> 59:08.504
We know when they are bad or good.

59:09.951 --> 59:14.320
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

59:14.490 --> 59:17.186
A smart man will think on these things.

59:18.428 --> 59:22.296
If he is still confused, he will tell somebody.

59:22.967 --> 59:25.026
For instance, he might tell you or me.

59:25.203 --> 59:27.068
A smart man always does this.

59:32.812 --> 59:35.542
I have seen such a sign.

59:37.117 --> 59:38.106
Really?

59:52.203 --> 59:54.569
I saw a man.

59:54.739 --> 59:57.708
A naked, white man.

59:57.876 --> 59:59.400
Are you sure it was a man?

01:00:01.815 --> 01:00:03.840
I saw his sex.

01:00:06.287 --> 01:00:07.720
Did you speak to him?

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:11.614
No.

01:00:26.745 --> 01:00:29.009
It's been two days now, and nothing.

01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:32.150
My presence here must
have been reported by now.

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:35.117
Have made all the preparations I can think of.

01:00:35.288 --> 01:00:36.414
Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.

01:00:37.892 --> 01:00:40.452
But will try to make
a big impression when they come.

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:41.889
Waiting.

01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:43.658
Post-script...

01:00:43.832 --> 01:00:47.199
The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:01.847
He might be a god.

01:01:02.021 --> 01:01:06.823
Or a white chief with special abilities.

01:01:06.994 --> 01:01:09.258
That is why we should talk with him.

01:01:12.034 --> 01:01:14.696
I do not care for this talk about this white man.

01:01:15.354 --> 01:01:19.083
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:23.554
When I hear that more whites are coming,
I want to laugh.

01:01:23.693 --> 01:01:25.922
We took a hundred horses from these people.

01:01:26.128 --> 01:01:28.425
There was no honor in it.

01:01:29.263 --> 01:01:31.196
They don't ride well. They don't shoot well.

01:01:31.365 --> 01:01:34.060
They're dirty.

01:01:34.234 --> 01:01:37.929
Those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here.

01:01:39.203 --> 01:01:40.965
And these people are said to flourish?

01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:43.571
I think they will all be dead soon.

01:01:46.108 --> 01:01:49.667
I think this fool is probably lost.

01:01:55.248 --> 01:01:58.704
Wind In His Hairs words are strong
and I have heard them.

01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:01.647
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.119
But make no mistake. The whites are coming.

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.346
Even our enemies agree on this.

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:11.083
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:15.922
...I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

01:02:16.129 --> 01:02:19.460
I see someone who might speak...

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:22.726
...for all the white people who are coming.

01:02:22.934 --> 01:02:27.164
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

01:02:29.672 --> 01:02:36.438
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

01:02:36.644 --> 01:02:40.703
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

01:02:40.914 --> 01:02:44.575
He is nothing to us.

01:02:44.716 --> 01:02:46.376
I will take some men.

01:02:46.551 --> 01:02:48.575
We will shoot some arrows into this white man.

01:02:48.752 --> 01:02:52.277
If he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.

01:02:52.455 --> 01:02:55.082
If he has no medicine, he will be dead.

01:03:00.561 --> 01:03:03.960
No man can tell another what to do.

01:03:04.162 --> 01:03:07.459
But killing a white man is a delicate matter.

01:03:07.632 --> 01:03:11.566
If you kill one, more are sure to come.

01:03:17.072 --> 01:03:21.598
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

01:03:21.775 --> 01:03:24.208
It's hard to know what to do.

01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:29.743
We should talk about this some more.

01:03:30.881 --> 01:03:33.576
That is all I have to say.

01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:10.504
What's the matter, now?

01:04:10.642 --> 01:04:13.201
We don't think this is such a good idea.

01:04:14.545 --> 01:04:16.068
If we take the horse of a white god...

01:04:16.479 --> 01:04:18.605
...they will make up songs about us.

01:04:19.749 --> 01:04:20.612
Maybe.

01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:24.077
They will ask us to go on raids.

01:04:24.218 --> 01:04:27.152
Who gets the horse?

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.183
I do.

01:04:29.489 --> 01:04:34.652
I do, but we share. Now who can say
this is not a great plan?

01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:40.921
It's always the same.

01:04:41.864 --> 01:04:43.490
Every time.

01:04:50.003 --> 01:04:52.402
Yes, sir, I have. No, I'll ask, sir.

01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:19.318
Well be heroes.

01:05:22.525 --> 01:05:24.651
Theyll write songs about us.

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:39.869
What happened?

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:48.233
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

01:05:50.979 --> 01:05:54.538
You shouldnt have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

01:05:55.249 --> 01:05:57.239
It was your idea.

01:05:57.417 --> 01:06:02.717
My idea was only to take the horse,
not fall down.

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:09.357
Otter hurt himself.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.524
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

01:06:14.763 --> 01:06:19.061
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

01:08:42.966 --> 01:08:45.899
I am Wind In His Hair.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.533
I am Wind In His Hair.

01:08:50.636 --> 01:08:53.934
Do you see that I am not afraid of you?

01:08:54.273 --> 01:08:55.671
Do you see?

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:12.289
The party that went against the Utes
is coming back.

01:10:13.061 --> 01:10:16.392
There are many hearts on the ground.

01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:54.193
I realize now that I have been wrong.

01:11:54.365 --> 01:11:56.229
All this time, I've been waiting.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.832
Waiting for what?

01:11:58.001 --> 01:11:59.399
For someone to find me?

01:11:59.535 --> 01:12:01.195
For Indians to take my horse?

01:12:01.403 --> 01:12:02.926
To see a buffalo?

01:12:03.138 --> 01:12:06.334
Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.

01:12:06.507 --> 01:12:09.236
It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it.

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:11.740
Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.400
I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking...

01:12:14.579 --> 01:12:18.069
...but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.

01:12:18.248 --> 01:12:19.942
I am through waiting.

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.946
What are you looking at?

01:13:53.881 --> 01:13:55.347
Son of a bitch!

01:14:08.358 --> 01:14:09.517
No. Wait.

01:14:10.693 --> 01:14:11.716
Wait.

01:14:14.262 --> 01:14:15.228
Wait.

01:14:18.632 --> 01:14:20.258
You need help. Youre hurt.

01:14:20.433 --> 01:14:22.366
- You need...
- No!

01:14:24.403 --> 01:14:26.870
Let me... You need help.

01:14:27.271 --> 01:14:30.239
You need help. Youre hurt. Let me help you.

01:14:34.844 --> 01:14:36.140
Youre hurt.

01:14:41.348 --> 01:14:42.439
Don't.

01:18:01.854 --> 01:18:03.115
She's hurt.

01:18:09.759 --> 01:18:11.020
She's hurt.

01:18:22.102 --> 01:18:24.365
You are not welcome here.

01:18:28.139 --> 01:18:30.368
No. She's hurt.

01:18:32.609 --> 01:18:34.974
Go away from us.

01:18:43.549 --> 01:18:46.880
You are not welcome. Go away from us.

01:19:29.281 --> 01:19:31.145
Stop.

01:19:31.317 --> 01:19:34.444
The soldier did not come to fight.

01:19:34.652 --> 01:19:37.814
He is going away and we will let him.

01:20:03.472 --> 01:20:06.634
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.

01:20:07.642 --> 01:20:10.201
We will go down and talk to the white man.

01:20:11.378 --> 01:20:14.244
And find out why he is here.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.487
If this council decides to talk to the white man...

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.747
...then it will be so.

01:20:28.923 --> 01:20:30.787
But in my mind it's not right...

01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:32.686
...that a chief as great as Ten Bears...

01:20:32.859 --> 01:20:35.884
...goes to ask the business of a puny,
trespassing white man...

01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:40.689
...who has only a smart horse
and a few white mans clothes.

01:20:42.566 --> 01:20:44.157
I will not go.

01:20:45.067 --> 01:20:46.897
You will go.

01:20:52.506 --> 01:20:54.735
And you will go.

01:20:56.008 --> 01:20:58.805
That is all I have to say.

01:21:19.425 --> 01:21:20.550
Welcome.

01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:22.784
Welcome.

01:21:25.129 --> 01:21:25.992
Hi!

01:21:33.335 --> 01:21:34.301
Come.

01:21:35.269 --> 01:21:36.792
Please, sit down.

01:21:37.837 --> 01:21:38.894
Sit down.

01:22:03.789 --> 01:22:05.779
Wait just a... Just a minute.

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:12.960
His mind is gone.

01:22:41.015 --> 01:22:42.606
Tatanka. Buffalo.

01:22:43.716 --> 01:22:45.444
- Buffalo.
- Tatanka.

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:54.780
Buffalo. Tatanka.

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:00.822
The fierce one, as I call him,
seems a very tough fellow.

01:23:00.995 --> 01:23:02.757
I hope I never have to fight him.

01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:06.420
From the little I know,
he seems to be honest and very direct.

01:23:06.599 --> 01:23:08.725
I like the quiet one immensely.

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:10.697
He's been patient and inquisitive.

01:23:10.869 --> 01:23:12.893
He seems eager to communicate.

01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:16.197
I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people.

01:23:16.406 --> 01:23:17.565
Buffalo.

01:23:25.812 --> 01:23:28.905
I believe I made an even greater impression
on their next visit.

01:23:29.048 --> 01:23:33.176
I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before.

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:16.641
Is the coffee not good?

01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:19.549
It's too strong, maybe.

01:24:22.585 --> 01:24:23.642
Sugar.

01:24:24.888 --> 01:24:25.979
Put in.

01:24:35.895 --> 01:24:37.054
Taste it.

01:24:48.503 --> 01:24:49.560
Sugar.

01:24:50.705 --> 01:24:52.103
You want some?

01:24:52.773 --> 01:24:54.171
You want some?

01:25:00.279 --> 01:25:01.575
Thats a lot.

01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:08.946
Okay.

01:25:09.852 --> 01:25:10.715
Yeah.

01:25:15.289 --> 01:25:17.518
It's good to finally have some company.

01:25:17.723 --> 01:25:20.589
So much goes unsaid
and I have the feeling that these people...

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.523
...the quiet one in particular,
want something from me.

01:25:23.695 --> 01:25:25.958
Made presents of coffee and most of the sugar.

01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:28.256
It didnt figure to last anyway.

01:25:28.498 --> 01:25:30.226
Don't believe I go too far in saying...

01:25:30.433 --> 01:25:33.128
...that a foundation
for good relations is being laid.

01:26:08.292 --> 01:26:10.725
Stands With A Fist.

01:26:14.563 --> 01:26:17.053
We will talk awhile.

01:26:25.638 --> 01:26:28.504
Your wounds are healing well?

01:26:29.941 --> 01:26:32.602
Yes, they are.

01:26:35.945 --> 01:26:38.435
You are happy here, with my family?

01:26:38.614 --> 01:26:40.843
I am glad to be here.

01:26:41.682 --> 01:26:45.081
I am missing my husband.

01:26:47.753 --> 01:26:50.915
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

01:26:51.055 --> 01:26:52.282
Perhaps.

01:26:57.627 --> 01:27:02.653
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming.

01:27:04.198 --> 01:27:06.461
They are coming into everyones country.

01:27:06.633 --> 01:27:08.623
I think they will soon be in ours.

01:27:09.068 --> 01:27:11.535
This white man
who lives at the old soldier fort...

01:27:11.703 --> 01:27:14.535
I have visited him
and I believe his heart is a good one.

01:27:21.176 --> 01:27:23.871
I am afraid of the white man at the fort.

01:27:24.779 --> 01:27:28.338
I am afraid he will tell others that I am here.

01:27:28.515 --> 01:27:30.778
I am afraid they will try to take me away.

01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:33.884
I've heard they take people away.

01:27:34.052 --> 01:27:36.679
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried.

01:27:36.854 --> 01:27:39.481
I cannot make the white man language.

01:27:39.656 --> 01:27:41.816
He cannot speak Sioux.

01:27:43.025 --> 01:27:46.221
It has been a long time since I made the talk.

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:48.394
I want you to try.

01:27:49.096 --> 01:27:50.619
I don't know how.

01:27:50.797 --> 01:27:52.229
Yes, you do.

01:27:52.431 --> 01:27:53.920
I can't.

01:27:55.267 --> 01:27:57.393
I can't. It's dead in me.

01:27:58.569 --> 01:28:02.867
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all the people.

01:28:03.005 --> 01:28:05.996
He knows things about the whites
which we do not.

01:28:06.174 --> 01:28:08.471
Now, you must remember.

01:28:12.012 --> 01:28:13.876
I can't.

01:28:24.721 --> 01:28:27.780
Will she make the white words?

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:31.785
She won't try. She is being difficult.

01:28:32.492 --> 01:28:34.982
Well, she's the one who's crying.

01:28:35.128 --> 01:28:38.392
Perhaps the difficulty is yours.

01:29:44.909 --> 01:29:46.136
Christine!

01:30:01.788 --> 01:30:03.982
Get em, Joe! Get them chickens!

01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:09.316
Billy, you get away from those puppies!

01:30:16.098 --> 01:30:17.086
Damn!

01:30:17.832 --> 01:30:20.356
Get the kids, and get them in the house.

01:30:21.802 --> 01:30:22.859
Go on!

01:30:25.404 --> 01:30:26.631
Christine!

01:30:27.706 --> 01:30:30.299
Christine! Where are you?

01:30:32.243 --> 01:30:33.937
I'm up here, mother.

01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:35.940
- Get down now.
- Why?

01:30:36.112 --> 01:30:37.408
Just do it.

01:30:45.485 --> 01:30:49.078
Stay right where you are. Get back.
Do you hear me?

01:30:50.222 --> 01:30:52.416
Joe, get in the house right now!

01:30:59.529 --> 01:31:00.552
Willie!

01:31:01.263 --> 01:31:04.560
- Who is it, Willie?
- They look like Pawnee.

01:31:04.732 --> 01:31:07.564
My father and your father are talking to them.

01:31:08.468 --> 01:31:10.935
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

01:31:11.804 --> 01:31:14.294
Go on. You heard him. Get out of here.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:28.913
Run, Christine!

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:31.247
I said run!

01:31:34.052 --> 01:31:35.382
Joe!

01:31:51.531 --> 01:31:52.758
Christine!

01:32:04.774 --> 01:32:06.138
Mommy!

01:32:45.236 --> 01:32:47.965
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.

01:32:48.137 --> 01:32:51.299
Two Socks, like Cisco,
has become a trusted friend.

01:32:51.607 --> 01:32:53.699
He still won't eat from my hand...

01:32:53.841 --> 01:32:58.003
...but his keen eyes and ears
never fail to alert me when something is wrong.

01:33:23.428 --> 01:33:24.553
Tatanka.

01:33:26.697 --> 01:33:27.560
No.

01:33:27.899 --> 01:33:30.025
No, I haven't seen any buffalo.

01:33:31.001 --> 01:33:32.058
Sorry.

01:33:51.115 --> 01:33:53.082
Are you hungry?

01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:56.515
Are you hungry?

01:33:57.085 --> 01:34:00.247
I have food. I have a lot of food.

01:34:23.938 --> 01:34:26.633
Nothing I've been told
about these people is correct.

01:34:26.806 --> 01:34:28.466
They are not beggars and thieves.

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.437
They are not the bogeymen
they've been made out to be.

01:34:31.676 --> 01:34:35.804
On the contrary, they are polite guests
and have a familiar humor I enjoy.

01:34:35.979 --> 01:34:38.037
Real communication is slow, however...

01:34:38.213 --> 01:34:40.942
...and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.

01:34:41.115 --> 01:34:43.912
Most of our progress
has been built on the basis of failure...

01:34:44.084 --> 01:34:45.880
...rather than success.

01:34:46.053 --> 01:34:49.851
I've thought to inquire
if the woman I found lived or not...

01:34:50.222 --> 01:34:53.883
...but it seems far too complicated a subject,
given our limitations.

01:34:54.091 --> 01:34:56.718
One thing is clear, however.
There are no buffalo.

01:34:56.894 --> 01:34:59.225
And it weighs heavy on their minds.

01:34:59.529 --> 01:35:01.689
Yesterdays meeting was the best yet.

01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:06.093
It seems I've been invited to the village
and I'm looking forward to going.

01:36:34.261 --> 01:36:35.693
We were waiting for you.

01:36:48.638 --> 01:36:51.037
We were waiting for you.

01:36:51.173 --> 01:36:54.732
Now tell him we are glad that he is here.

01:37:00.079 --> 01:37:01.238
Hello.

01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:03.637
You...

01:37:04.516 --> 01:37:05.607
Here...

01:37:08.419 --> 01:37:09.442
Good.

01:37:13.055 --> 01:37:15.045
Thank you. I feel good.

01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:16.753
I feel good.

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:23.654
Ask him why he is at the soldier fort.

01:37:27.565 --> 01:37:31.761
The soldier fort.

01:37:32.701 --> 01:37:33.724
Wait.

01:37:35.904 --> 01:37:37.530
What is your names?

01:37:38.705 --> 01:37:41.537
- Our names?
- What is his name?

01:37:46.445 --> 01:37:51.779
He's right. Introductions should come first.

01:37:54.551 --> 01:37:55.710
He...

01:37:57.519 --> 01:37:58.678
He...

01:37:59.821 --> 01:38:00.752
Kick.

01:38:01.422 --> 01:38:02.854
Kick?

01:38:03.523 --> 01:38:04.489
More.

01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:05.948
More kick?

01:38:06.492 --> 01:38:07.856
More kicking?

01:38:08.393 --> 01:38:09.518
Kicking.

01:38:11.795 --> 01:38:14.194
Bird? Bird, kicking bird.

01:38:14.364 --> 01:38:15.921
Kicking Bird.

01:38:21.336 --> 01:38:22.597
What is he...

01:38:24.305 --> 01:38:25.601
Is he chief?

01:38:26.005 --> 01:38:26.936
No.

01:38:39.448 --> 01:38:42.007
A holy man.

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:44.380
Holy man.

01:38:49.288 --> 01:38:50.151
Your name?

01:38:52.057 --> 01:38:54.718
- I don't...
- How are you called?

01:39:26.181 --> 01:39:27.477
Get up?

01:39:32.385 --> 01:39:33.408
Stand up?

01:39:34.953 --> 01:39:36.419
Stands?

01:39:37.588 --> 01:39:39.521
Stands. Your names Stands?

01:39:39.957 --> 01:39:41.389
Stands.

01:39:44.793 --> 01:39:46.760
- With.
- With?

01:39:46.929 --> 01:39:49.761
- With.
- Stands with?

01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.088
Fist?

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.766
Yes.

01:39:56.402 --> 01:39:58.028
Stands With A Fist?

01:40:01.472 --> 01:40:03.063
Stands With A Fist.

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.129
I'm John Dunbar.

01:40:06.242 --> 01:40:08.209
John Dunbar.

01:40:14.781 --> 01:40:16.077
Dumb Bear.

01:40:17.049 --> 01:40:18.845
No, not Dumb Bear.

01:40:19.718 --> 01:40:20.809
Dunbar.

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:22.783
Dun...

01:40:22.987 --> 01:40:24.044
Bar.

01:40:24.421 --> 01:40:25.546
Not Dumb Bear.

01:40:25.722 --> 01:40:26.847
Dunbar.

01:40:44.335 --> 01:40:46.825
Theres been an exciting breakthrough
with the Indians.

01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:49.199
The woman I found
on the prairie speaks English...

01:40:49.406 --> 01:40:51.737
...and today, clear progress was made.

01:40:51.941 --> 01:40:55.898
She is white, and though I cannot be sure
how she came to be with these people...

01:40:56.077 --> 01:40:58.203
...I can tell she is not a captive.

01:40:58.612 --> 01:40:59.908
While I'm not afraid...

01:41:00.079 --> 01:41:02.842
...I don't feel completely
welcome by everyone in the village.

01:41:03.014 --> 01:41:05.709
My being here must be Kicking Birds idea.

01:41:06.217 --> 01:41:08.741
He is very enthusiastic and like two children...

01:41:08.886 --> 01:41:11.718
...we are both anxious
to know more about each other.

01:41:11.888 --> 01:41:14.014
But I find myself holding back.

01:41:14.223 --> 01:41:17.588
For some reason,
I am reluctant to answer all his questions.

01:41:17.725 --> 01:41:19.089
Maybe it's my sense of duty...

01:41:19.292 --> 01:41:21.816
...but something tells me not to say too much.

01:41:34.403 --> 01:41:36.495
It was good to see Fort Sedgewick again...

01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:40.400
...and yet I look forward
to another visit with my new neighbors.

01:41:43.309 --> 01:41:44.900
This is still my home, however...

01:41:45.044 --> 01:41:46.567
...and I remain watchful
for my relief and can only hope...

01:41:47.879 --> 01:41:52.041
...that my negotiations
with the wild people of the plains will bear fruit.

01:43:59.404 --> 01:44:00.165
Buffalo!

01:44:01.339 --> 01:44:04.205
Buffalo! I've seen buffalo!

01:44:34.795 --> 01:44:36.125
Buffaloes!

01:44:36.564 --> 01:44:37.928
Tatanka.

01:44:39.699 --> 01:44:40.995
Tatanka?

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:42.188
Yeah.

01:45:24.463 --> 01:45:27.158
Riders were sent out to pick up the trail.

01:45:27.432 --> 01:45:30.093
In the time it took to gather
my things at Sedgewick...

01:45:30.267 --> 01:45:32.700
...the entire tribe was well on its way.

01:45:33.069 --> 01:45:35.730
Their efficiency and speed
with which they moved...

01:45:35.872 --> 01:45:38.704
...was enough to impress
any military commander.

01:45:39.141 --> 01:45:42.836
Spirits are high, and overnight
I've gone from a person of suspicion...

01:45:42.976 --> 01:45:44.966
...to one of genuine standing.

01:45:45.311 --> 01:45:48.801
I am greeted with open smiles
and looks of appreciation.

01:45:48.947 --> 01:45:51.039
In short, I have become a celebrity.

01:45:51.249 --> 01:45:52.510
Loo ten tant!

01:45:52.816 --> 01:45:55.306
- Loo ten tant!
- Loo ten tant!

01:45:56.619 --> 01:45:59.644
Scouts picked up the trail
exactly where I said it would be.

01:46:00.522 --> 01:46:02.352
It was not hard to find...

01:46:02.523 --> 01:46:06.355
...a gigantic swath of torn-up ground
extending to the horizon.

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:09.619
The numbers it took to create
this impossible image...

01:46:09.795 --> 01:46:11.455
...was hard to imagine.

01:47:38.089 --> 01:47:39.350
Loo ten tant!

01:47:41.658 --> 01:47:42.919
Loo ten tant!

01:50:10.162 --> 01:50:12.095
Who would do such a thing?

01:50:12.264 --> 01:50:13.525
The field was proof enough...

01:50:13.664 --> 01:50:16.598
...that it was a people
without value and without soul.

01:50:16.933 --> 01:50:19.127
With no regard for Sioux rights.

01:50:19.768 --> 01:50:22.600
The wagon tracks
leading away left little doubt...

01:50:22.804 --> 01:50:26.397
...and my heart sank,
as I knew it could only be white hunters.

01:50:26.740 --> 01:50:28.764
Voices that had been joyous all morning...

01:50:28.942 --> 01:50:32.876
...were now as silent
as the dead buffalo left to rot in this valley...

01:50:33.078 --> 01:50:36.637
...killed only for their tongues
and the price of their hides.

01:51:16.842 --> 01:51:18.103
Loo ten tant.

01:55:07.135 --> 01:55:09.694
It was suddenly clear now
what had happened...

01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:12.303
...and my heart sank
as I tried to convince myself...

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:16.202
...that the white men who'd been killed
were bad people and deserved to die.

01:55:16.675 --> 01:55:18.107
But it was no use.

01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:21.073
I tried to believe
that Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird...

01:55:21.245 --> 01:55:25.339
...and the others who shared in the killing
were not so happy for having done it.

01:55:25.514 --> 01:55:26.912
But they were.

01:55:28.917 --> 01:55:32.181
As I looked at familiar faces,
I realized that the gap between us...

01:55:32.319 --> 01:55:35.116
...was greater than I could ever have imagined.

01:55:54.936 --> 01:55:57.927
As they celebrated into the night
the coming hunt...

01:55:58.104 --> 01:56:00.230
...it was hard to know where to be.

01:56:00.906 --> 01:56:04.738
I don't know if they understood,
but I could not sleep among them.

01:56:04.976 --> 01:56:07.944
There had been no looks,
and there was no blame.

01:56:08.278 --> 01:56:09.676
There was only the confusion of a people
not able to predict a future.

02:03:04.967 --> 02:03:06.336
Are you all right?

02:04:55.523 --> 02:04:56.595
I can't.

02:04:57.779 --> 02:04:59.836
No, I'm full.

02:05:00.002 --> 02:05:03.111
I'm full, and I can't tell the story anymore.

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:16.989
You want to try it?

02:05:17.923 --> 02:05:19.405
You want to try it?

02:05:22.007 --> 02:05:22.927
Here.

02:05:52.653 --> 02:05:54.428
I can't. This is too much.

02:06:01.864 --> 02:06:02.613
Good trade.

02:06:06.464 --> 02:06:07.728
This is a good trade.

02:06:13.417 --> 02:06:15.947
No, no, I can't. I'm full, I'm tired.

02:06:16.092 --> 02:06:17.024
No!

02:06:27.635 --> 02:06:29.698
Loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!

02:06:37.872 --> 02:06:40.071
Tatanka. Big tatanka.

02:06:40.247 --> 02:06:41.579
Big tatanka.

02:07:11.728 --> 02:07:12.696
Thats my hat!

02:07:23.237 --> 02:07:24.729
Youre wearing my hat.

02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:30.089
It's my hat.

02:07:30.463 --> 02:07:32.698
I found it on the prairie. It's mine.

02:07:35.315 --> 02:07:36.979
No, you...

02:07:38.526 --> 02:07:39.619
My hat.

02:07:58.566 --> 02:08:02.534
That hat belongs to the Lieutenant.

02:08:02.748 --> 02:08:07.527
He left it on the prairie. He didnt want it.

02:08:09.271 --> 02:08:12.371
Well, you can see he wants it now.

02:08:13.587 --> 02:08:17.430
We all know that it's a soldiers hat.

02:08:18.872 --> 02:08:21.437
We all know who wears it.

02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:24.618
If you want to keep it, thats all right.

02:08:24.828 --> 02:08:26.959
But give something for it.

02:09:03.655 --> 02:09:04.855
Good trade.

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.104
There you are.

02:11:19.305 --> 02:11:20.825
Come here, Cisco.

02:12:17.899 --> 02:12:20.624
It seems every day ends with a miracle here.

02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:23.923
And whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day.

02:12:25.198 --> 02:12:27.492
To stay any longer would have been useless.

02:12:27.665 --> 02:12:30.458
We had all the meat we could possibly carry.

02:12:30.864 --> 02:12:33.692
We had hunted for three days,
losing a half a dozen ponies...

02:12:33.864 --> 02:12:35.828
...and only three men injured.

02:12:36.497 --> 02:12:38.859
I'd never known a people so eager to laugh...

02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:42.085
...so devoted to family,
so dedicated to each other.

02:12:42.863 --> 02:12:45.828
And the only word
that came to mind was harmony.

02:12:55.062 --> 02:12:57.117
Many times I've felt alone...

02:12:57.328 --> 02:12:59.292
...but until this afternoon...

02:12:59.462 --> 02:13:01.982
...I'd never felt completely lonely.

02:15:59.925 --> 02:16:01.921
Made a long patrol today.

02:16:02.334 --> 02:16:04.330
Theres nothing to report.

02:16:04.645 --> 02:16:07.486
Time seems irrelevant
except for the fact that I am bored...

02:16:07.591 --> 02:16:09.964
...and these hours alone are endless.

02:16:30.024 --> 02:16:32.499
It is difficult for me to muster any enthusiasm...

02:16:32.570 --> 02:16:34.736
...for my regular duties here.

02:16:34.846 --> 02:16:37.343
And the fort is showing
serious signs of neglect.

02:16:40.236 --> 02:16:43.682
The truth is,
I am missing the company of my friends.

02:16:43.786 --> 02:16:47.392
I can see all of their faces,
but somehow it is not enough.

02:16:47.536 --> 02:16:49.566
Tomorrow I will pay them a visit.

02:16:49.679 --> 02:16:52.450
It may be forward of me, but what can it hurt?

02:16:52.861 --> 02:16:55.165
After all, they are my neighbors.

02:18:09.388 --> 02:18:13.153
The night sounds have become so familiar
as to be comforting.

02:18:13.358 --> 02:18:17.690
My life on the prairies a good one
and for the most part, I am content.

02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:35.409
The Indians have a great pull for me
that goes beyond curiosity.

02:18:35.513 --> 02:18:38.309
Theres something wise about them
and I'm drawn to them...

02:18:38.415 --> 02:18:41.906
...in ways much stronger
than my obligations to the military.

02:20:00.767 --> 02:20:01.993
Go home!

02:20:05.604 --> 02:20:06.864
Damn him.

02:20:27.159 --> 02:20:28.784
God! Go home!

02:20:34.534 --> 02:20:35.500
Go!

02:20:35.868 --> 02:20:37.561
Go home, Two Socks!

02:20:39.005 --> 02:20:40.402
Bad wolf!

02:21:20.814 --> 02:21:24.373
You were right. He is a special white man.

02:21:24.484 --> 02:21:26.746
He should have a real name.

02:21:43.602 --> 02:21:47.901
It is autumn now and I am spending
more time than ever with my friends.

02:21:47.974 --> 02:21:51.601
They have given me
my own lodge and I feel comfortable there.

02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:55.701
We talk every day,
but I know Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.

02:21:55.815 --> 02:21:59.249
He always wants to know
how many more white people are coming.

02:21:59.518 --> 02:22:04.180
I tell him they will most likely
pass through this country and nothing more.

02:22:04.390 --> 02:22:06.482
But I am speaking in half-truths.

02:22:06.659 --> 02:22:11.185
One day there will be too many,
but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.

02:22:11.331 --> 02:22:14.561
I am sure that Stands With A Fist
knows that I am holding back...

02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:17.366
...but to her credit, she says nothing.

02:22:46.266 --> 02:22:50.395
A war party is going against the Pawnee soon
and I have asked to go.

02:22:50.536 --> 02:22:52.696
I sense I made a mistake in doing so...

02:22:52.805 --> 02:22:55.637
...but I could not bring myself to take it back.

02:22:55.742 --> 02:22:58.402
They are my friends,
and from what little I gather...

02:22:58.510 --> 02:23:00.999
...the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.

02:23:01.114 --> 02:23:03.774
I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.

02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:09.776
Come in, please.

02:23:12.293 --> 02:23:13.519
Sit down?

02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:19.088
Kicking Bird want to know...

02:23:19.198 --> 02:23:22.757
...why you want to make war on the Pawnee.

02:23:23.404 --> 02:23:26.099
They have done nothing to you.

02:23:26.806 --> 02:23:28.635
They are Sioux enemies.

02:23:36.215 --> 02:23:38.943
Only Sioux warriors to go.

02:23:39.953 --> 02:23:41.782
Tell him that I have been a warrior...

02:23:41.888 --> 02:23:45.186
...longer than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

02:23:45.692 --> 02:23:46.918
Tell him.

02:24:01.541 --> 02:24:04.771
He said that the Sioux way of being a warrior...

02:24:04.878 --> 02:24:06.741
...is not the white way.

02:24:07.381 --> 02:24:11.372
- You are not ready.
- I know, I understand.

02:24:11.484 --> 02:24:14.007
Tell him I cannot learn these ways in camp.

02:24:21.462 --> 02:24:23.622
He also asks that you...

02:24:24.664 --> 02:24:28.064
...watch over his family while he is gone.

02:24:29.102 --> 02:24:32.831
This thing he asks is a great honor for you.

02:24:36.409 --> 02:24:40.276
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

02:24:46.754 --> 02:24:49.482
He thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.

02:24:51.024 --> 02:24:52.990
Who is Dances With Wolves?

02:24:54.962 --> 02:24:58.453
It is the name which all the people...

02:24:58.565 --> 02:25:00.327
...are calling you now.

02:25:00.901 --> 02:25:02.366
Dances With...

02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:05.335
Thats right.

02:25:05.773 --> 02:25:07.033
That day.

02:25:08.307 --> 02:25:09.967
Dances With Wolves.

02:25:11.644 --> 02:25:13.269
How do you say it?

02:26:13.073 --> 02:26:18.532
Keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.

02:26:18.645 --> 02:26:21.111
I like to make the talk.

02:27:01.722 --> 02:27:02.948
I'm here.

02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.524
We walk.

02:27:40.694 --> 02:27:42.183
I cut this off.

02:27:43.231 --> 02:27:45.460
I shaved it off. More.

02:27:47.668 --> 02:27:49.760
Grass grows on the prairie.

02:27:49.871 --> 02:27:51.336
Grass grows on the prairie?

02:27:53.607 --> 02:27:55.072
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

02:27:55.142 --> 02:27:57.267
You said, Fire lives on the prairie.

02:27:57.378 --> 02:27:58.571
I did?

02:27:59.279 --> 02:28:02.212
No laughing, though.

02:28:06.253 --> 02:28:09.049
That man is a fighter.

02:28:13.328 --> 02:28:14.521
Again.

02:28:15.329 --> 02:28:18.660
- That man is a fighter.
- Okay, I have it.

02:28:22.403 --> 02:28:23.460
Yes.

02:28:30.944 --> 02:28:32.637
Hoo hoo, right?

02:28:38.218 --> 02:28:39.184
No?

02:28:48.329 --> 02:28:49.624
Try this.

02:28:51.899 --> 02:28:53.559
What's the word...

02:28:54.135 --> 02:28:55.624
...for beautiful?

02:29:00.908 --> 02:29:03.137
What are you doing?

02:29:03.243 --> 02:29:06.972
It's hot, and we are sitting in the shade.

02:29:11.452 --> 02:29:13.418
I'm hungry.

02:29:31.204 --> 02:29:33.899
How is Dances With Wolves?

02:29:36.010 --> 02:29:38.135
What do you mean?

02:29:39.379 --> 02:29:41.868
How is he learning?

02:29:42.717 --> 02:29:46.412
He is a fast learner.

02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:49.352
What did you think I meant?

02:30:09.545 --> 02:30:11.637
You go for water, today?

02:30:16.451 --> 02:30:19.509
Then let us take you.

02:30:34.869 --> 02:30:36.858
How did you get your name?

02:30:41.209 --> 02:30:44.074
I was not very old...

02:30:45.079 --> 02:30:47.478
...when I came to be with the people.

02:30:48.384 --> 02:30:50.247
And I was made to work.

02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:53.512
I worked every day, very hard.

02:30:55.289 --> 02:30:58.620
There was a woman...

02:30:58.726 --> 02:31:00.692
...who didnt like me much.

02:31:02.297 --> 02:31:06.356
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she...

02:31:10.973 --> 02:31:12.199
Beat me?

02:31:16.210 --> 02:31:17.938
And one day, she was...

02:31:18.814 --> 02:31:20.974
...calling me these bad names...

02:31:21.416 --> 02:31:23.905
...with her face in my face...

02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:26.215
...and I hit her.

02:31:28.190 --> 02:31:31.282
I was not very big, but she fell down.

02:31:31.593 --> 02:31:33.753
She fell hard and didnt move.

02:31:35.197 --> 02:31:38.528
And then I stood over her with my fist...

02:31:38.801 --> 02:31:40.096
...and I asked if...

02:31:40.536 --> 02:31:42.798
...there was any other woman...

02:31:43.404 --> 02:31:45.666
...who wanted to call me bad names.

02:31:47.642 --> 02:31:50.006
No one bothered me after that day.

02:31:53.114 --> 02:31:56.082
No, I wouldnt think so.

02:32:01.189 --> 02:32:02.518
Show me.

02:32:03.625 --> 02:32:05.591
Show me where you hit her.

02:32:34.356 --> 02:32:36.254
Why are you not married?

02:32:40.361 --> 02:32:41.826
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

02:32:44.767 --> 02:32:46.062
I'm sorry.

02:32:48.270 --> 02:32:49.395
Can I help you?

02:33:19.768 --> 02:33:22.564
You are not talking today?

02:33:22.671 --> 02:33:24.364
No, I am not.

02:34:30.773 --> 02:34:36.869
Some of your words are wrong
but you are learning fast.

02:34:37.914 --> 02:34:42.213
So what can I tell you today?

02:34:43.485 --> 02:34:45.781
I want to know about Stands With A Fist.

02:34:45.888 --> 02:34:48.946
Why is there no man with her?

02:34:50.359 --> 02:34:53.019
She is in mourning.

02:34:55.631 --> 02:34:56.756
I don't...

02:34:58.101 --> 02:35:01.627
I do not understand mourning.

02:35:03.206 --> 02:35:05.570
She cries for someone.

02:35:07.843 --> 02:35:10.207
Cries for who?

02:35:14.017 --> 02:35:16.849
It is not polite to speak of the dead.

02:35:16.953 --> 02:35:20.910
But you are new, so I will tell you.

02:35:21.024 --> 02:35:23.253
She cries for her husband.

02:35:23.358 --> 02:35:25.450
He was killed not long ago.

02:35:25.561 --> 02:35:30.155
That is how you came to find her on the prairie.

02:35:33.569 --> 02:35:37.470
How long will she cry?

02:35:39.409 --> 02:35:44.310
It is Kicking Birds place
to say when she is finished.

02:35:44.681 --> 02:35:48.240
He's the one that found her
when she was very little.

02:36:06.002 --> 02:36:08.935
People are talking about you.

02:36:11.641 --> 02:36:13.665
What are they saying?

02:36:16.413 --> 02:36:18.573
They are proud of the medicine...

02:36:18.681 --> 02:36:22.137
...you are making with Dances With Wolves.

02:36:24.987 --> 02:36:29.251
I have hurt him, and I should go talk to him.

02:36:30.359 --> 02:36:33.054
You can't. He is gone.

02:36:33.931 --> 02:36:36.124
He left this morning.

02:39:01.343 --> 02:39:03.208
Bet you were thinking:

02:39:03.313 --> 02:39:05.304
Now, why don't he write?

02:39:06.185 --> 02:39:07.811
Hello, Two Socks.

02:39:35.333 --> 02:39:36.560
Come on.

02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:44.772
I won't hurt you. Come on. You can do this.

02:39:45.183 --> 02:39:46.774
You can do this.

02:39:51.192 --> 02:39:52.352
Come on.

02:40:04.515 --> 02:40:05.981
This is easy.

02:40:06.519 --> 02:40:08.384
This is easy, Two Socks.

02:41:29.927 --> 02:41:31.553
I am in mourning.

02:41:40.945 --> 02:41:42.411
No, we cannot.

02:41:42.714 --> 02:41:45.616
- Yes.
- We must be careful.

02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:49.088
We must be careful.

02:41:49.191 --> 02:41:50.657
Okay.

02:42:54.501 --> 02:42:55.559
Wait!

02:45:01.916 --> 02:45:02.974
What?

02:45:03.853 --> 02:45:05.047
Trouble.

02:45:28.728 --> 02:45:32.130
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.

02:45:32.234 --> 02:45:34.702
Hunters found them not far to the north.
Soon be here.

02:45:34.872 --> 02:45:38.866
Stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.

02:45:38.979 --> 02:45:41.846
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

02:45:41.949 --> 02:45:43.883
Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

02:45:45.824 --> 02:45:47.018
I will get them.

02:45:47.793 --> 02:45:49.692
Stone Calf, wait.

02:45:49.796 --> 02:45:50.854
I have guns.

02:45:50.965 --> 02:45:53.433
I have many rifles.

02:45:55.606 --> 02:45:57.700
- At the fort?
- Yes.

02:45:58.444 --> 02:46:00.969
No. The ride is long and we can spare no men.

02:46:01.081 --> 02:46:04.175
Guns would make one warrior like two.

02:46:09.630 --> 02:46:12.828
Take one man and go quickly.

02:46:13.937 --> 02:46:16.428
I will take Smiles A Lot.

02:47:06.459 --> 02:47:07.425
Okay!

02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:43.879
Shoot the gun!

02:54:10.843 --> 02:54:12.974
It was hard to know how to feel.

02:54:13.085 --> 02:54:15.651
I'd never been in a battle like this one.

02:54:15.761 --> 02:54:18.395
There was no dark political objective.

02:54:18.505 --> 02:54:22.507
This was not a fight for territory or riches
or to make men free.

02:54:22.619 --> 02:54:26.497
It was fought to preserve the food stores
that would see us through the winter.

02:54:26.602 --> 02:54:31.016
To protect the lives of women and children
and loved ones only a few feet away.

02:54:31.318 --> 02:54:34.955
Stone Calf was a great loss,
but even the old men could not remember...

02:54:35.067 --> 02:54:37.005
...such a one-sided victory.

02:54:37.107 --> 02:54:40.049
And I gradually began
to look at it in a new way.

02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:42.816
I felt a pride I'd never felt before.

02:54:43.632 --> 02:54:46.436
I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.

02:54:46.810 --> 02:54:49.340
Perhaps the name itself had no meaning.

02:54:49.453 --> 02:54:52.588
But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over...

02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:55.539
...I knew for the first time who I really was.

02:56:18.755 --> 02:56:22.723
When we were younger,
he always bragged about how brave he was.

02:56:22.837 --> 02:56:26.303
And what a great chief he would make.

02:56:26.417 --> 02:56:28.686
He thought I was impressed.

02:56:28.792 --> 02:56:33.365
While walking on the prairie,
we surprised a small herd of buffalo.

02:56:33.476 --> 02:56:37.045
And the first thing this brave warrior did
is run for a tree.

02:56:39.767 --> 02:56:41.705
He would have forgotten all about me...

02:56:41.806 --> 02:56:43.904
...if he hadnt needed my help to climb it.

02:56:44.017 --> 02:56:48.623
And we sat there all day
as this old cow circled below.

02:56:48.733 --> 02:56:51.572
Making loud noises
and hitting her head against the trunk.

02:57:02.752 --> 02:57:06.595
Where are you going?
There is gambling tonight.

02:57:06.701 --> 02:57:09.174
Horsebacks games are always good.

02:57:10.548 --> 02:57:15.020
I'm tired.
Horseback already has a good rifle of mine.

02:57:18.578 --> 02:57:20.412
Good night.

02:58:03.714 --> 02:58:06.781
How long will Stands With A Fist mourn?

02:58:07.629 --> 02:58:09.532
I don't know.

02:58:13.283 --> 02:58:16.384
I hope it will not be too long.

02:58:19.005 --> 02:58:21.068
Has something happened?

02:58:21.714 --> 02:58:23.309
What?

02:58:24.190 --> 02:58:26.960
She has found love again.

02:58:28.038 --> 02:58:30.010
With who?

02:58:30.113 --> 02:58:31.582
Who do you think?

02:58:31.686 --> 02:58:32.949
Tell me.

02:58:33.058 --> 02:58:35.360
Dances With Wolves.

02:58:38.344 --> 02:58:40.316
Are you certain of this?

02:58:41.154 --> 02:58:44.894
When you see them together, you will know.

02:58:46.641 --> 02:58:48.636
What are people saying?

02:58:49.419 --> 02:58:51.449
They like the match.

02:58:56.612 --> 02:58:58.710
No one is angry?

02:58:58.821 --> 02:59:02.823
It makes sense. They are both white.

02:59:04.876 --> 02:59:09.051
I suppose I will be the one to say something.

02:59:09.996 --> 02:59:12.562
She's your daughter now.

02:59:13.106 --> 02:59:15.044
I know.

02:59:20.568 --> 02:59:24.446
Relax. You can't see everything coming.

02:59:25.219 --> 02:59:28.526
Stop it. Quit your playing.

02:59:42.316 --> 02:59:43.946
Stands With A Fist.

02:59:45.261 --> 02:59:47.791
You will mourn no more.

03:00:08.180 --> 03:00:10.746
Sit, sit.

03:00:16.913 --> 03:00:19.912
Theres talk that you want to get married.

03:00:22.232 --> 03:00:23.599
To who?

03:00:24.373 --> 03:00:26.436
To Stands With A Fist.

03:00:26.548 --> 03:00:28.451
Thats the one, isn't it?

03:00:28.555 --> 03:00:29.752
She's in mourning.

03:00:29.862 --> 03:00:31.331
Not today.

03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:34.170
Kicking Bird has released her.

03:00:34.277 --> 03:00:36.249
He did?

03:00:36.653 --> 03:00:38.784
What are you doing here?

03:00:40.100 --> 03:00:43.235
Kicking Bird told me to wait.

03:00:45.051 --> 03:00:47.250
You might have to wait a long time.

03:00:47.359 --> 03:00:51.429
Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking Bird
riding on the prairie.

03:00:52.948 --> 03:00:56.015
He says he was talking to himself.

03:00:56.125 --> 03:00:57.618
A medicine man takes it pretty hard...

03:00:57.732 --> 03:00:59.670
...when he is the last to know something.

03:01:01.915 --> 03:01:04.114
What do I do?

03:01:07.334 --> 03:01:11.509
You are pretty poor
and a Sioux girl is not for free.

03:01:11.617 --> 03:01:14.113
I don't know if you can get married.

03:01:18.912 --> 03:01:20.884
I have the buckskin...

03:01:20.986 --> 03:01:22.479
No, thats too much medicine.

03:01:24.968 --> 03:01:29.382
Do you think my horse is too much medicine?

03:01:31.324 --> 03:01:33.820
For a girl.

03:01:38.283 --> 03:01:42.126
Wait here. Maybe we can help you.

03:01:42.265 --> 03:01:43.895
Wait.

03:01:46.146 --> 03:01:48.084
Thats all I do is wait!

03:02:08.966 --> 03:02:12.671
The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.

03:02:12.813 --> 03:02:15.755
The generosity of the people was astonishing.

03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:19.199
The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.

03:02:19.337 --> 03:02:23.647
Even the poorer families
wanted to give up animals they could not afford.

03:02:23.820 --> 03:02:26.019
It was hard to turn them away.

03:02:30.781 --> 03:02:32.776
Black Shawl was a mystery.

03:02:33.556 --> 03:02:37.057
I couldnt guess what she was thinking
and she offered no advice...

03:02:37.606 --> 03:02:39.601
...no words of encouragement.

03:02:45.469 --> 03:02:47.771
I may have been the brunt of an inside joke...

03:02:47.877 --> 03:02:50.179
...that included the entire village...

03:02:50.354 --> 03:02:52.155
...but I was determined.

03:02:55.539 --> 03:02:58.913
Wind In His Hair told me
if all the gifts were gone in the morning...

03:02:59.019 --> 03:03:01.082
...my offer had been accepted.

03:03:02.199 --> 03:03:06.407
I spent a sleepless night
wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.

03:03:07.384 --> 03:03:10.657
I had no idea
what Kicking Birds decision would be.

03:03:34.837 --> 03:03:36.255
Turn around.

03:03:38.268 --> 03:03:40.520
You look good.

03:03:40.618 --> 03:03:43.498
You know, the man she mourned for...

03:03:43.606 --> 03:03:46.237
He was my best friend.

03:03:47.991 --> 03:03:49.951
I didnt know that.

03:03:52.375 --> 03:03:54.335
He was a good man.

03:03:54.981 --> 03:03:57.959
It has been hard for me to like you.

03:03:59.366 --> 03:04:02.604
I am not the thinker Kicking Bird is.

03:04:02.702 --> 03:04:04.987
I always feel anger first.

03:04:05.086 --> 03:04:07.588
There were no answers to my questions.

03:04:07.691 --> 03:04:12.608
But now I think he went away
because you were coming.

03:04:12.712 --> 03:04:14.867
That is how I see it.

03:04:39.734 --> 03:04:42.332
This is a good day for me.

03:04:44.254 --> 03:04:45.569
And for me.

03:04:49.072 --> 03:04:52.727
If you want this man, take his hand in yours.

03:05:07.387 --> 03:05:09.422
I had never been married before.

03:05:09.532 --> 03:05:12.400
I don't know if all grooms
have the same experience...

03:05:12.502 --> 03:05:16.787
...but as Kicking Bird began to speak about
what was expected of a Sioux husband...

03:05:16.891 --> 03:05:20.580
...my mind began to swim
in a way that shut out everything but her...

03:05:20.686 --> 03:05:22.924
...the tiny details of her costume...

03:05:23.029 --> 03:05:25.031
...the contours of her shape...

03:05:25.338 --> 03:05:27.182
...the light in her eyes...

03:05:27.384 --> 03:05:29.386
...the smallness of her feet.

03:05:30.124 --> 03:05:32.890
I knew that the love
between us would be served.

03:05:38.704 --> 03:05:41.933
Have you heard all that I have said?

03:05:44.248 --> 03:05:45.226
Yes.

03:05:47.054 --> 03:05:50.709
Good, then take her inside.

03:05:50.815 --> 03:05:52.490
She is your wife.

03:05:55.569 --> 03:05:57.043
Good.

03:05:58.848 --> 03:06:01.206
Thank you.

03:06:07.520 --> 03:06:08.656
Bye.

03:06:14.707 --> 03:06:15.843
Bye.

03:06:59.697 --> 03:07:03.256
Dances With Wolves door
is closed a lot these days.

03:07:03.365 --> 03:07:07.264
I think they're having trouble making a baby.

03:07:07.366 --> 03:07:10.663
I don't think they're having trouble at all.

03:07:14.670 --> 03:07:18.069
If we pull the smoke flap shut,
they will come out for sure.

03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:46.981
Dances With Wolves, are you in there?

03:07:49.653 --> 03:07:53.780
Today I am riding away to a far away place.

03:07:53.889 --> 03:07:56.014
I would like you to ride with me.

03:08:11.763 --> 03:08:13.922
It's good to be out.

03:08:14.965 --> 03:08:17.295
Yes, it must be.

03:08:18.500 --> 03:08:20.864
We are trying for a baby.

03:08:22.268 --> 03:08:23.962
No waiting?

03:08:24.569 --> 03:08:26.263
No waiting.

03:08:30.572 --> 03:08:34.972
I was just thinking
that of all the trails in this life...

03:08:36.175 --> 03:08:38.971
...there is one that matters most.

03:08:39.076 --> 03:08:42.339
It is the trail of a true human being.

03:08:43.645 --> 03:08:48.079
I think you are on this trail, and it is good to see.

03:09:08.056 --> 03:09:10.522
We call you the Busy Bee.

03:09:46.541 --> 03:09:50.372
It is said that all the animals were born here.

03:09:50.476 --> 03:09:54.637
That from here they spread over the prairies
to feed all the people.

03:09:55.312 --> 03:09:58.837
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

03:10:49.970 --> 03:10:51.698
It's quiet here.

03:12:51.693 --> 03:12:54.251
We must wait for these people.

03:12:55.595 --> 03:12:59.324
No, they've been gone a week. Maybe more.

03:13:01.999 --> 03:13:05.262
We will water the horses and go home.

03:13:51.588 --> 03:13:55.351
You always ask about the white people.

03:13:57.157 --> 03:13:59.316
You always want to know
how many more are coming.

03:14:01.693 --> 03:14:04.319
There will be a lot, my friend.

03:14:04.427 --> 03:14:06.155
More than can be counted.

03:14:08.729 --> 03:14:09.956
How many?

03:14:12.665 --> 03:14:14.154
Like the stars.

03:14:28.506 --> 03:14:32.462
It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

03:14:39.878 --> 03:14:42.640
We should tell this to Ten Bears.

03:15:09.124 --> 03:15:11.147
The men who wore this came...

03:15:11.259 --> 03:15:14.090
...in the time of my grandfathers grandfather.

03:15:14.727 --> 03:15:17.387
Eventually we drove them out.

03:15:18.162 --> 03:15:21.857
Then the Mexicans came.
They do not come here anymore.

03:15:22.297 --> 03:15:25.287
In my own time, the Texans.

03:15:25.398 --> 03:15:27.887
They have been like all the others.

03:15:30.967 --> 03:15:35.628
They take without asking.

03:15:36.637 --> 03:15:40.400
I don't know if we are ready for these people.

03:15:41.872 --> 03:15:46.397
But I think you are right.
I think they will keep coming.

03:15:47.675 --> 03:15:50.141
When I think of that, I look at this helmet.

03:15:52.678 --> 03:15:56.771
Our country is all that we have,
and we will fight to keep it.

03:15:57.880 --> 03:15:59.903
Tomorrow we will strike the village...

03:16:00.015 --> 03:16:02.345
...and go to the winter camp.

03:16:33.530 --> 03:16:36.292
You have everything from the soldier fort?

03:16:36.565 --> 03:16:37.588
Yes.

03:16:37.965 --> 03:16:40.056
Theres nothing for me there.

03:16:41.034 --> 03:16:42.432
Thats good.

03:16:56.041 --> 03:16:57.405
The journal.

03:16:59.676 --> 03:17:01.336
Stands With... Wait!

03:17:01.744 --> 03:17:02.903
Words are important!

03:17:03.010 --> 03:17:05.340
The words in the book
are like a trail for people to follow.

03:17:05.445 --> 03:17:09.208
Now, it tells everything about my life here.
I must get it.

03:17:09.447 --> 03:17:10.572
Enough.

03:17:10.681 --> 03:17:13.239
We cannot wait for you.

03:17:25.154 --> 03:17:27.313
I'll catch up.

03:18:08.941 --> 03:18:10.066
Injun!

03:18:10.509 --> 03:18:11.975
Get him! Injun!

03:18:17.645 --> 03:18:18.611
No!

03:18:40.222 --> 03:18:42.415
Stay down. Stay.

03:18:42.824 --> 03:18:44.188
My God.

03:18:44.892 --> 03:18:46.119
God.

03:18:51.795 --> 03:18:53.022
It's okay.

03:19:35.348 --> 03:19:36.837
Something has happened.

03:19:36.949 --> 03:19:39.507
Dances With Wolves is not coming.

03:19:40.184 --> 03:19:42.150
He must have trouble.

03:19:43.819 --> 03:19:49.152
Pick two good men
and send them back to the soldier fort.

03:20:00.960 --> 03:20:02.324
Spivey.

03:20:03.228 --> 03:20:05.387
- Spivey!
- Yeah, Sergeant.

03:20:06.529 --> 03:20:08.688
Tell the major he's waking up.

03:20:10.631 --> 03:20:12.529
Move your worthless ass.

03:20:24.104 --> 03:20:26.093
You got yourself a hell of a shiner...

03:20:26.939 --> 03:20:28.200
...didnt you?

03:20:28.306 --> 03:20:30.363
Majors coming through.

03:20:40.478 --> 03:20:42.342
Does he speak English?

03:20:42.513 --> 03:20:44.139
I don't know, sir.

03:20:45.948 --> 03:20:47.710
Speak English?

03:20:49.549 --> 03:20:52.072
Talk English? Talk!

03:20:53.885 --> 03:20:55.476
I speak English.

03:21:00.020 --> 03:21:01.384
Who are you?

03:21:03.589 --> 03:21:07.750
Lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.

03:21:08.358 --> 03:21:10.052
Why are you dressed like this?

03:21:12.327 --> 03:21:16.158
I came out from Fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

03:21:16.761 --> 03:21:18.727
Do you have proof of that?

03:21:21.297 --> 03:21:25.560
My journals on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.

03:21:25.666 --> 03:21:27.757
It will tell you everything.

03:21:28.100 --> 03:21:30.692
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

03:21:30.802 --> 03:21:33.098
Did you find anything? A journal?

03:21:33.469 --> 03:21:35.765
No, we didnt find nothing, sir.

03:21:36.204 --> 03:21:37.761
Wheres Edwards?

03:21:38.305 --> 03:21:39.771
He's outside.

03:21:44.375 --> 03:21:46.773
He didnt find nothing either.

03:21:51.011 --> 03:21:53.307
Somebody find me Edwards.

03:22:02.116 --> 03:22:03.776
You turned Injun, didnt you?

03:22:08.920 --> 03:22:10.250
Didnt you?

03:22:14.955 --> 03:22:17.148
What did you say your name was?

03:22:17.891 --> 03:22:19.050
Dunbar.

03:22:20.158 --> 03:22:22.556
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

03:22:22.659 --> 03:22:24.625
You say youre an officer?

03:22:24.927 --> 03:22:28.724
- God. Did you read my orders?
- No.

03:22:29.396 --> 03:22:31.453
They're in my journal.

03:22:31.730 --> 03:22:33.424
There are no orders.

03:22:33.931 --> 03:22:35.625
Theres no journal.

03:22:40.101 --> 03:22:42.090
Why are you out of uniform?

03:22:44.503 --> 03:22:46.231
I have to relieve myself.

03:22:49.472 --> 03:22:52.166
- Sergeant, take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

03:22:53.841 --> 03:22:55.000
Lets go.

03:22:59.043 --> 03:23:01.168
- He's a white man.
- Doesnt look white to me.

03:23:02.011 --> 03:23:04.978
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer.

03:23:05.079 --> 03:23:06.909
Do you salute him or shoot him?

03:23:15.918 --> 03:23:17.782
Here, you. Eyes front.

03:23:23.688 --> 03:23:25.279
I said eyes front!

03:23:27.356 --> 03:23:29.822
Don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!

03:23:29.890 --> 03:23:31.151
Get him!

03:24:21.615 --> 03:24:23.604
Why are you out of uniform?

03:24:27.617 --> 03:24:29.106
What's the army doing out here?

03:24:30.185 --> 03:24:32.708
- Lieutenants asking the questions.
- Bauer.

03:24:39.022 --> 03:24:41.318
Were charged with apprehending...

03:24:44.259 --> 03:24:47.715
Were charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property...

03:24:47.827 --> 03:24:50.589
...retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

03:24:50.695 --> 03:24:54.628
- There are no hostiles.
- We will ascertain that for ourselves.

03:24:54.730 --> 03:24:57.720
If youll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter...

03:24:57.831 --> 03:25:00.195
...your conduct will be re-evaluated.

03:25:00.733 --> 03:25:02.722
- What conduct?
- With all due respect...

03:25:02.834 --> 03:25:06.097
Your status as a traitor might improve
should you choose...

03:25:06.202 --> 03:25:08.896
...to cooperate with the United States Army.

03:25:10.737 --> 03:25:13.033
Theres nothing for you to do out here.

03:25:16.707 --> 03:25:19.173
Are you willing to cooperate or not?

03:25:21.942 --> 03:25:23.431
Speak up!

03:25:27.245 --> 03:25:30.576
I am Dances With Wolves.

03:25:32.781 --> 03:25:33.644
What's that?

03:25:36.516 --> 03:25:39.142
I have nothing to say to you.

03:25:39.250 --> 03:25:42.445
You are not worth talking to.

03:25:52.457 --> 03:25:56.118
Sergeant, form a detail
and take this man down to the river.

03:25:57.026 --> 03:25:59.822
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.

03:26:01.928 --> 03:26:03.417
Not you, Spivey.

03:26:31.475 --> 03:26:32.805
Lieutenant.

03:26:35.410 --> 03:26:37.308
Major wants to see you.

03:27:11.627 --> 03:27:12.991
Spivey.

03:27:18.063 --> 03:27:20.052
Spivey. You got paper?

03:27:20.698 --> 03:27:24.154
- What's it to you?
- Give me some, shit-bird.

03:27:24.533 --> 03:27:25.556
Can you read?

03:27:25.767 --> 03:27:27.926
No, I can't read. What the hells the difference?

03:27:28.035 --> 03:27:30.968
You can't read either. Now just give me some.

03:27:31.503 --> 03:27:35.334
- Quick, give me some!
- All right. Hold your horses.

03:28:57.443 --> 03:28:58.568
Bauer!

03:29:02.212 --> 03:29:03.473
Let go of me!

03:29:11.783 --> 03:29:14.614
Lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.

03:29:17.386 --> 03:29:19.114
You son of a bitch!

03:29:22.054 --> 03:29:23.543
It's all right.

03:29:24.289 --> 03:29:25.778
It's all right.

03:29:26.390 --> 03:29:30.517
He's going to get hungrier, thats all.
But maybe that don't matter.

03:29:31.358 --> 03:29:34.325
Word is they're going to ship you back to Hayes.

03:29:34.426 --> 03:29:37.086
And once you get there, they gonna hang you.

03:29:40.763 --> 03:29:43.753
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

03:29:58.871 --> 03:29:59.996
Get up in there!

03:30:26.017 --> 03:30:27.983
Spivey, what is that?

03:30:28.419 --> 03:30:30.544
Looks like he's following us.

03:30:30.853 --> 03:30:32.547
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

03:30:33.721 --> 03:30:34.846
Dang. You missed him.

03:30:35.922 --> 03:30:38.821
- Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
- Wait. I seen him first.

03:30:38.923 --> 03:30:40.753
- Get down!
- Look at that stupid bastard.

03:30:40.858 --> 03:30:42.586
He ain't even moving.

03:30:43.159 --> 03:30:46.752
- Wait a minute! Thats my shot.
- Shoot him!

03:30:47.861 --> 03:30:50.327
Shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.

03:30:50.762 --> 03:30:51.625
Shoot him!

03:30:54.964 --> 03:30:57.021
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

03:31:01.634 --> 03:31:03.464
Bauer, get him off him!

03:31:10.271 --> 03:31:11.794
He might have killed you.

03:31:19.675 --> 03:31:21.141
I'll get that son of a bitch.

03:31:27.746 --> 03:31:29.372
Sit down, goddamn it!

03:31:41.752 --> 03:31:43.309
Thats it. I got him!

03:31:46.822 --> 03:31:48.913
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

03:31:50.390 --> 03:31:51.879
Son of a bitch!

03:31:52.525 --> 03:31:53.684
Get up!

03:31:55.392 --> 03:31:56.415
Get up!

03:31:57.994 --> 03:31:59.790
I mean it! Get up!

03:31:59.895 --> 03:32:01.861
Get up! Come on, get up!

03:32:02.428 --> 03:32:03.451
What?

03:32:03.563 --> 03:32:06.792
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

03:32:07.864 --> 03:32:09.989
You men get back here!

03:32:13.634 --> 03:32:14.998
Goddamn it!

03:32:53.653 --> 03:32:54.550
Boo.

03:33:03.124 --> 03:33:05.386
Clear behind that stand of trees?

03:33:09.626 --> 03:33:11.354
All right. Lets go.

03:33:34.872 --> 03:33:36.168
I don't see nobody.

03:33:54.881 --> 03:33:56.074
Indians!

03:37:38.619 --> 03:37:39.585
No.

03:40:28.097 --> 03:40:32.724
Dances With Wolves is quiet these days.

03:40:34.501 --> 03:40:36.990
Is his heart bad?

03:40:46.105 --> 03:40:49.266
Killing the soldiers at the river...

03:40:51.741 --> 03:40:53.934
...was a good thing.

03:40:54.843 --> 03:40:57.742
I did not mind killing those men.
I was glad to do it.

03:41:01.780 --> 03:41:07.476
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

03:41:08.649 --> 03:41:11.912
They think I am a traitor.

03:41:16.620 --> 03:41:19.985
And they will hunt for me.

03:41:20.088 --> 03:41:24.283
And when they find me, they find you.

03:41:25.791 --> 03:41:31.623
I think it would be wise to move the village now.

03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:40.823
I will be leaving.

03:41:43.266 --> 03:41:47.256
I must go and talk with those who would listen.

03:41:56.105 --> 03:41:58.970
Quiet. You are hurting my ears.

03:42:08.944 --> 03:42:11.604
Leave us alone.

03:42:29.420 --> 03:42:33.444
You are the only white man I have ever known.

03:42:33.556 --> 03:42:37.489
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

03:42:37.591 --> 03:42:41.354
But I think you are wrong.

03:42:42.293 --> 03:42:45.351
The man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists.

03:42:45.462 --> 03:42:51.886
Now there is only a Sioux
named Dances With Wolves.

03:42:55.799 --> 03:42:58.027
Lets smoke awhile.

03:43:03.703 --> 03:43:06.499
With Ten Bears,
it was always more than a while.

03:43:06.604 --> 03:43:10.367
There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.

03:43:10.473 --> 03:43:12.133
But I was sure of myself.

03:43:12.240 --> 03:43:16.367
I would be an excuse and thats all
the army would need to find this place.

03:43:16.476 --> 03:43:19.136
I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp...

03:43:19.244 --> 03:43:22.609
...but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.

03:43:22.712 --> 03:43:26.941
He reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything.

03:43:27.380 --> 03:43:29.778
Ten Bears was an extraordinary man.

03:44:11.101 --> 03:44:12.965
You have nothing to say?

03:44:15.370 --> 03:44:17.098
What can I tell you?

03:44:18.805 --> 03:44:20.737
What's ever on your mind.

03:44:27.408 --> 03:44:29.374
Youve made the decision.

03:44:33.845 --> 03:44:35.607
My place is with you.

03:44:36.613 --> 03:44:38.239
I go where you go.

03:44:41.815 --> 03:44:43.441
Youre not afraid?

03:44:44.583 --> 03:44:45.571
No.

03:44:49.086 --> 03:44:52.144
I told Ten Bears
we'd leave when the snow breaks.

03:44:59.290 --> 03:45:01.120
Did you tell everyone?

03:45:05.193 --> 03:45:06.659
Not everyone.

03:45:43.177 --> 03:45:45.405
It's all right.

03:46:18.327 --> 03:46:19.657
You...

03:46:20.762 --> 03:46:22.251
...finish your pipe?

03:46:35.402 --> 03:46:36.698
Good pipe.

03:46:38.202 --> 03:46:39.532
How...

03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:41.434
...does it smoke?

03:46:44.606 --> 03:46:46.095
I've never smoked it.

03:46:57.946 --> 03:46:59.276
We come far...

03:46:59.713 --> 03:47:01.043
...you and me.

03:47:03.782 --> 03:47:05.612
I will not forget you.

03:48:54.133 --> 03:48:56.725
Dances With Wolves.

03:48:57.901 --> 03:49:00.527
I am Wind In His Hair.

03:49:00.636 --> 03:49:04.126
Do you see that I am your friend?

03:49:08.172 --> 03:49:11.367
Can you see that you will always be my friend?

03:50:39.049 --> 03:50:40.981
Sergeant! Over here! Now!
