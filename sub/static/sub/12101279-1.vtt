01:19.454 --> 01:21.911
You prefer corporate
or government jobs.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.908
There's usually a complete dossier.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.119
They allow time for planning.

01:28.213 --> 01:32.297
Planning because typically
they prefer low profile.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.466
Low profile is safer.

01:34.553 --> 01:37.841
Low profile makes almost no ripple.

01:38.849 --> 01:42.433
Low profile is unspectacular.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.680
Time can become an issue.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.183
You may have to hasten things along.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.107
Your training lets you
slow your breathing,

01:50.193 --> 01:52.024
lets you calm your heart.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.319
Two pounds of pressure and...

02:01.538 --> 02:04.530
But organized crime
likes a visible statement.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.872
Let them know you were there.
Send a message written in blood.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.751
With this employer, you rarely
get more than a name,

02:17.846 --> 02:19.928
sometimes not even that.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.683
It adds to the risk,
and it adds to the fee.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.681
But you know there's a risk in that too.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.018
The other risk with organized crime:

02:31.109 --> 02:33.191
It creates enemies.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.439
Experience has taught you
she won't call for help

02:35.530 --> 02:37.987
until she's vacuumed up his cash

02:38.075 --> 02:40.066
and has at least slipped on her panties.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.948
It's vital that you show no urgency.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.458
You trust your planning, your accuracy.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.250
Two minutes until she calls
the front desk.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.333
Fifteen to 30 seconds to get
the manager on duty,

02:59.346 --> 03:02.179
some low-level schlump
working the graveyard shift.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.269
He'll call either his boss
or the head of security.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.526
Both will be home sleeping.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.569
The phone rings once every six seconds.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.657
Typically it will ring four times
before they're conscious enough to answer.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.202
That's another 18 seconds.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.083
Another minute before police
are dispatched.

03:37.676 --> 03:41.635
In this part of the city, police should
arrive in under three minutes.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.175
You're a professional...

03:50.105 --> 03:53.142
An expert devoted to timing and precision.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.191
A virtuoso.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.332
You keep your tools in pristine condition.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.543
Perfection demands precision.

04:27.559 --> 04:30.175
Precision demands perseverance.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.019
You live off the grid as much as possible.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.647
You leave no trace of your real self.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.026
You're a shadow.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.498
You keep your true identity protected.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.552
You avoid the us postal service

05:47.639 --> 05:51.348
and open a mailbox run by
an independent company.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.933
No hames.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.441
No trail.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.917
You make sure
the process to engage you

06:19.004 --> 06:21.120
is complex enough
to preserve your anonymity.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.503
You might miss out on some assignments.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.927
You see it as the cost of doing business.

06:29.014 --> 06:32.256
However, you set your fee
to compensate.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.323
Hmm?

07:30.408 --> 07:32.490
You recognize the code.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.796
(50.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.718
You're outside established protocol.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.512
This is a one-off.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.633
And afterwards, we'll return to procedure.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.226
It's a short time frame.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.770
- How short?
- Forty-eight hours.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.395
Not much time to plan.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.531
Is it worth it?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.405
I'm seeing double.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.790
Let me be clear. Crystal clear.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.287
For this fee...

08:25.296 --> 08:28.163
It is delicate.

08:29.175 --> 08:33.087
Special outcome demanded by client.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.044
- Understood.
- Good.

08:36.057 --> 08:39.674
I knew you would.
We go back a long way.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.977
Do not put me in a bad position.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.771
Call me when it's done.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.224
Details?

08:47.318 --> 08:51.857
You can inquire discretely today...

08:52.866 --> 08:55.608
At 6:32.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.507
Six, three, two.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.256
You need to make it look
like an accident.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.020
You don't mind
the added complexity in general.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.724
But to do it right,
you need more time to plan.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.809
And to add to it, no headlines.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.068
Quiet.

10:14.489 --> 10:17.105
A plan forms in your head.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.752
You have to hit a two-inch moving target

10:31.840 --> 10:35.583
on a car going 60-plus miles per hour
from 50 yards away.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.879
And you only get one shot.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.136
The blown tire should
pull him sharply to the right.

10:48.231 --> 10:52.691
He'll overcorrect, which should cause him
to hit this very building.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.945
It's rushed. You know that.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.448
You wish you had more time.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.661
But it's a plan. It'll have to do.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.331
You know the rules.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.876
Do not rush.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.429
Do not hesitate.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.110
Hey, mom.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.612
Mom! Here, pass!

11:47.707 --> 11:48.707
Okay, kick it over.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.708
Nice one, mom.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.127
Do not get distracted.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.546
Careful.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.043
I got it. Don't worry. I got it.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.639
Do not question.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.684
I ook out!

12:12.857 --> 12:14.142
Mom!

12:26.621 --> 12:28.202
Mom! Mom!

12:28.289 --> 12:30.621
- Call the police!
- Oh, my god!

12:30.708 --> 12:32.414
Somebody call 911!

14:58.106 --> 14:59.346
Relax.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.186
It's only me.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.819
Your father was a good soldier.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.658
- So you've said.
- It's a fact.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.079
And you too.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.623
So the medals say.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.285
It's a family business.

15:23.297 --> 15:27.256
I figured that I might find you here
since you don't answer the phone.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.502
- I needed some time.
- I understand.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.596
Till now, you were perfect, on point.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.429
I rushed you, I know.
Couldn't be helped.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.390
It's on me, not you.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.601
Yeah.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.735
Collateral damage. It happens.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.070
You know that.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.989
This is not amarijah.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.359
I know what happened there.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.703
You shouldn't let this stuff
get to you, kid.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.198
I'm not.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.912
It's not your fault.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.672
Did your father ever tell you
about pinkville?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.588
No. Never spoke of it.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.544
Ah, that's not surprising.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.506
That's where we met, you know... pinkville.
Me and your old man.

16:16.601 --> 16:20.389
We were just young kids,
fresh out of boot camp.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.220
One night, the officers told us,

16:22.315 --> 16:24.418
"tomorrow you'll meet the enemy,
a whole battalion of gooks,

16:24.442 --> 16:27.684
viet cong, who killed your...

16:28.821 --> 16:32.484
Friends, your relatives,
who'd kill your family

16:32.575 --> 16:35.112
and rape your sister if they could.â

16:36.120 --> 16:39.829
So, we kids, we toked it up,
and the officers, they just drank it up,

16:39.916 --> 16:41.872
because, you know, they were...

16:41.959 --> 16:44.291
They were preparing us, as they say.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.252
So we were prepared and...

16:48.382 --> 16:51.545
We woke at 3:00 A.M.,
jumped on those choppers and...

16:52.553 --> 16:53.759
We took off...

16:54.764 --> 16:56.880
To kill or be killed.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.848
It's really simple
when you think about it.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.551
Only, finally, when we got there,

17:01.646 --> 17:04.762
already the intelligence was bad,
because usually it was.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.223
Because there was no hostile fire.
There was no fire at all, really.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.772
There were just old men,

17:11.864 --> 17:13.479
women and children,

17:14.742 --> 17:18.576
sitting around fires, heating their rice,
ready for breakfast.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.117
So, the officers, they just
gathered up all these...

17:22.208 --> 17:23.887
The old men and the women
and the children,

17:23.960 --> 17:28.169
even their pigs and their dogs
and their cats and...

17:28.256 --> 17:30.212
Pushed them into ditches.

17:30.299 --> 17:35.885
And they ordered us,
me and your old man, to plug them.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.885
So we did. Clip after clip after clip.

17:39.976 --> 17:44.310
Like a couple of automats
staring at each other, just firing and...

17:45.314 --> 17:46.724
So we couldn't see the target,

17:46.816 --> 17:51.230
the blood and the... carnage.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.819
Until we stopped firing.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.522
And then, as bad as that was,

17:56.617 --> 18:01.236
when it was over, we started to have lunch
right there near the ditches.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.822
And, you know, maybe 10, 15 feet away
from the bodies,

18:04.917 --> 18:09.160
from the stench and the groaning.

18:09.255 --> 18:13.043
Anyway, suddenly we hear this noise.
It was a whine or a squeal or something.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.671
Maybe it was one of their pigs.

18:16.679 --> 18:19.324
So, we all go to the top of the ditch
and we look in for the first time.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.259
And it's...

18:27.106 --> 18:30.223
This ain't no pig. No, sir.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.776
It's a little boy,

18:34.864 --> 18:36.980
two, maybe three, tough to say.

18:37.074 --> 18:41.693
But his mother must've sheltered him
with her own body.

18:41.787 --> 18:46.577
And he was too young to know that he
should've just played dead, stupid kid.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.158
So the whole squad is watching him now,

18:49.253 --> 18:53.622
crawling on tiny hands
and feet over dead bodies,

18:53.716 --> 18:55.627
probably his whole family.

18:55.718 --> 18:59.757
And then, none of us is moving.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.133
We're just watching.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.967
Maybe just rooting for the kid.

19:06.979 --> 19:11.848
Till he gets to the top and he starts
running away towards the jungle.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.102
The jungle.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.947
And still none of us moves.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.364
And then this little guy, this officer,
this lieutenant,

19:24.455 --> 19:27.913
he comes running up to us
and he's still finishing his k rations.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.834
And he sees all of us
staring at the tree line,

19:31.921 --> 19:37.541
and then he sees the kid,
maybe 30 yards away, still going.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.716
And he looks at me, and he looks
at your old man, and he says, "plug him."

19:42.807 --> 19:44.763
Pointing at the kid. "Plug him.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.018
Shoot him."

19:48.020 --> 19:51.308
So, I look at your old man
and he looks at me, and...

19:55.277 --> 20:00.817
I can see clear as day
in his eyes, he can't, he's done.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.237
So I look back to this lieutenant,

20:04.328 --> 20:09.743
this heartless little motherfucking prick
of a human fucking being...

20:13.295 --> 20:15.786
And he looks at me and he smiles.

20:16.799 --> 20:21.168
He points at the kid, he said,
"plug him, goddamn it.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.464
Shoot him."

20:25.725 --> 20:26.931
Yeah.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.691
Oh, yeah.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.271
Yeah, I was a good soldier that day.

20:46.454 --> 20:48.285
- How could he live with that?
- Huh?

20:48.372 --> 20:50.237
How could he live with that?

20:52.001 --> 20:53.207
How could you?

20:53.294 --> 20:55.376
We were soldiers. It's what we do.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.711
It's what we did.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.165
Taking orders from our superior officers.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.178
We followed them.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.091
Did we regret it? Sure.

21:06.182 --> 21:10.767
I had no guilt, because...
We were not responsible for it.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.684
That's not what we trained for.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.897
Yeah. But I'll tell you this...

21:24.283 --> 21:27.116
We humans, we human beings,
whatever we are,

21:27.203 --> 21:30.695
we're just homicidal killing machines.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.954
Get it? Homicidal killing
machines, that's all.

21:36.086 --> 21:39.294
And all the military training
and all that stuff,

21:40.299 --> 21:44.087
oh, it's just finishing school.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.968
You'd better believe it, kid.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.213
Yeah.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.929
God, what a beautiful day, huh?

21:54.480 --> 21:58.769
Anyway, 25 years later,
I ran into this guy,

21:58.859 --> 22:00.724
this guy from our squad.

22:01.779 --> 22:06.614
And I could tell straightaway
by just looking at him

22:06.700 --> 22:08.531
that he'd never forgotten.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.361
He was all busted up inside.
Do you know what I mean?

22:11.455 --> 22:15.323
I remember he looked at me
and he said to me, "you know...

22:18.295 --> 22:21.378
Some of us will walk in those jungles

22:21.465 --> 22:25.583
and hear those cries
of anguish and horror...

22:27.096 --> 22:29.178
For all eternity."

22:31.141 --> 22:32.597
Yeah.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.136
But me and your dad,

22:38.524 --> 22:39.764
we didn't.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.360
And I'm grateful for that.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.900
Yep.

22:52.371 --> 22:56.364
God, I haven't talked like that
for 50 years, do you know that?

22:57.585 --> 22:58.916
Yeah.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.214
Next time,

23:06.302 --> 23:09.886
answer your goddamn phone,
do you get me?

23:14.351 --> 23:16.262
- Yeah.
- Good.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.761
I'm glad.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.473
So, you have a good day.

24:26.632 --> 24:27.792
Yes?

24:43.107 --> 24:44.597
So, what do you think?

24:46.402 --> 24:47.858
You ready for this?

24:47.945 --> 24:51.733
I would tell you to pass
on this one, but...

24:52.741 --> 24:54.652
I can see you've already decided.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.985
Arrive early, look for every advantage,

24:58.080 --> 25:01.197
and don't hesitate.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.035
Call me when it's done.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.382
You get another assignment.

25:17.725 --> 25:21.058
Routine data. Name, employer, address.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.601
Means it's typical.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.679
No name, no address,

25:24.773 --> 25:26.809
no way to confirm identity,

25:26.900 --> 25:29.687
except a cryptic note
that says they don't know much.

25:29.778 --> 25:33.521
Therefore your quarry
must be very special.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.988
You leave your vehicle
in long-term parking

26:17.076 --> 26:19.283
and rent a nondescript sedan.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.031
Dark colors are best, then gray.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.531
You make precise plans.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.287
But the biggest flaw in any plan

26:27.377 --> 26:29.789
always comes from events
you can't control.

26:30.798 --> 26:34.086
But there's always a margin for error.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.338
- There's no bathroom!
- It's around the corner!

26:40.432 --> 26:43.640
It's not around the corner!
No, I told you, stay in the car!

27:08.460 --> 27:10.041
That's gonna be trouble.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.212
You got an eye for trouble?

27:15.217 --> 27:16.627
I'm lookin" at you, ain't I?

27:22.182 --> 27:23.797
All right, thank you.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.431
Bitch!

27:28.522 --> 27:31.202
- Did you see a girl around here?
- I think she's around the corner.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.601
- What are you doing?
- I wasn't... aah!

27:36.697 --> 27:38.153
Why don't you listen?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.802
What do you not understand
about staying in the car?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.782
I had to go! Aah!

27:42.870 --> 27:45.031
You don't go. You just wait.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.363
Now we're late. Get in the car.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.575
Stay!

27:54.840 --> 27:56.421
You got something to say?

27:59.678 --> 28:03.262
No point. None of my business, is it?

28:03.348 --> 28:06.932
That's right. None of your business.

28:10.314 --> 28:11.520
My hero.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.919
Ride?

28:49.311 --> 28:50.311
I'd better not.

29:03.492 --> 29:04.823
I won't ask again.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.692
It'll just make things worse later.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.700
Maybe it's just time to get away, hmm?

29:10.791 --> 29:12.452
Just leave.

29:12.542 --> 29:17.002
I wish, mister.
But I got nowhere else to go.

29:20.717 --> 29:21.923
Yeah.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.118
You make quick note
of the players in the game.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.088
Lone man. Back to the wall,
view of the entrance,

31:25.175 --> 31:28.212
coat still on, bulge indicating
a shoulder holster.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.804
A couple. The guy also sitting
where he can observe the entrance.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.725
He sits forward, tense.
Maybe pistol tucked in back.

31:41.650 --> 31:42.935
Small world.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.354
You can say that again.

31:46.363 --> 31:48.900
Please take a seat anywhere.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.575
You pick a seat that lets you
keep an eye on both men

31:53.662 --> 31:55.493
but leaves your back vulnerable.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.626
Can I get you something to drink?

32:07.717 --> 32:09.173
Coffee. Black.

32:17.894 --> 32:22.809
It was pricey, but you secure an illegal
app that scans the dmv database.

32:26.528 --> 32:27.893
Was I right?

32:27.988 --> 32:30.354
About the girl at the gas station.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.823
Yes, you were right.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.949
She'll figure it out, or she won't.
That's quite a gift you have there.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.075
Sometimes it's a curse.

32:41.877 --> 32:42.877
Anything else?

32:43.879 --> 32:45.369
Yes.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.836
Would you know an area around here
called white rivers?

32:50.844 --> 32:54.962
There's rivers and... white water rafting.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.384
Does that help?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.512
Thank you. Leave the pot.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.394
You check the results of the license
plates and look for clues.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.775
You try to match the players to the cars.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.733
You know the Jeep out back
belongs to the waitress,

33:15.827 --> 33:18.864
but there are three other cars
in the parking lot.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.994
The man with the gun in his jacket
probably drives the gray Ford.

33:23.084 --> 33:27.248
Could be law enforcement,
or he just may be white rivers.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.955
The couple, the guy whose position
is second best,

33:30.050 --> 33:31.836
probably arrived after the loner.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.339
Can't keep his eyes off the door.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.260
Two more vehicles in the parking lot

33:36.348 --> 33:38.304
suggest they have not been
a couple for long,

33:38.391 --> 33:40.222
or that they aren't a couple at all.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.350
You classify him as an amateur,

33:43.438 --> 33:45.804
but amateurs can still be dangerous.

33:51.988 --> 33:56.231
Another player. Local law enforcement.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.454
Deputy Myers.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.658
- How you doing?
- Oh, fine.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.288
Rosie?

34:07.379 --> 34:09.040
Rosie went home sick, but lucky I'm here.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.666
Hmm.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.590
- Pastry?
- Maybe one for the road, then.

34:13.677 --> 34:16.635
What about two? One for here,
one for the road.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.177
I won't tell anyone.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.471
You read my mind.

34:20.475 --> 34:21.931
That's what I do.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.882
Would you like something
to drink with that?

34:35.907 --> 34:38.023
- How about a glass of milk?
- Sure.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.029
Bit of a rush, I see.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.824
We'll survive.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.826
The game should begin,

34:49.920 --> 34:52.833
but... the deputy has thrown
a wrench in the plan.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.644
The first piece to any plan
is your escape.

35:11.735 --> 35:14.442
You want it clean, unobserved, anonymous.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.650
It also adds a hew element.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.356
Which one?

35:20.368 --> 35:22.654
But the deputy's arrival
muddies your plan.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.619
You quickly reassess.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.119
Without the deputy, you could
complete the assignment.

35:28.209 --> 35:30.825
The outcome would look like
a robbery gone wrong.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.205
But now...

35:32.297 --> 35:33.412
Thank you.

35:34.424 --> 35:36.039
Which one?

35:38.428 --> 35:41.386
Something's not right.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.384
You decide to give it some more time.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.342
If nothing changes, you'll leave
and revise the plan.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.143
You don't need another rush job.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.189
You gonna lick that clean?

36:02.202 --> 36:03.692
I was thinking about it.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.944
So...

36:07.082 --> 36:08.663
Dixy.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.787
Yeah, like the cup, but...

36:11.878 --> 36:14.961
Most people, they say "Dee."

36:15.048 --> 36:16.208
What do you want me to say?

36:16.299 --> 36:18.460
You don't have to say anything.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.631
And why's that?

36:20.637 --> 36:22.423
Because I can divine your thoughts.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.005
- Divine?
- Try me.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.974
White rivers.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.932
I know what you want.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.810
And what's that?

36:34.901 --> 36:37.233
Maybe something to eat instead.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.771
Actually...

36:42.367 --> 36:45.575
Is there another motel other than the one
I saw on my way into town?

36:45.662 --> 36:47.243
No, that's the only one.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.197
There's a couple of b&bs,
but they're closed.

36:50.291 --> 36:51.371
Too early in the season.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.700
Well, how late are you open?

36:54.713 --> 36:58.501
Usually shut at 9:00,
but if it's slow, we shut at 8:00.

36:58.591 --> 37:01.833
Maybe I'll stop in later
for a little something.

37:02.846 --> 37:07.306
Okay. If the lights are out,
just... tap on the door.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.098
I'll open it for you.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.550
You wait for the players to come out.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.762
The couple.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.679
Both the car and the house
are in the woman's name.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.682
You figure that either, one,
they're a long term couple

38:36.773 --> 38:38.684
and have put everything
under her name,

38:38.775 --> 38:43.144
or two, the guy may have
recently entered her life.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.025
If two is true, it's a good cover.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.796
The lone man with the gun in his jacket...

39:04.801 --> 39:06.462
He's the most likely target.

39:07.512 --> 39:11.505
Wouldn't be going out on a limb to guess
the loner is heading to the motel.

40:43.358 --> 40:46.316
Probably first burned well before noon.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.563
Now it's completely charred.

40:48.655 --> 40:51.488
I can make some fresh for you,
if you want.

40:52.492 --> 40:53.492
Not necessary.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.234
Sorry if I kept you waiting,

40:56.329 --> 40:59.196
I was studying.
I didn't even hear you come in.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.997
There's a college in this area?

41:02.085 --> 41:03.325
No.

41:04.337 --> 41:06.498
Oh, I'm studying to get my ged.

41:06.589 --> 41:09.251
Oh. Well, it's never too late, huh?

41:09.342 --> 41:11.378
Yeah. That's what my grandpa always says.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.005
Well, before he died.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.472
You need a room, or...

41:17.558 --> 41:19.719
Can't get anything past you, can I?

41:19.811 --> 41:22.803
Something quiet.
How about the room at the end?

41:22.897 --> 41:25.058
Yeah. Yeah, it's empty.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.105
But there's a guest
in the room right next door.

41:27.193 --> 41:31.061
Let me see if I have something
with empties on both sides.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.567
Is the room next to the one at the end

41:33.658 --> 41:36.320
occupied by a couple
who plan to go at it all night?

41:37.328 --> 41:40.616
No. No, it's just some old guy.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.368
Then the room at the end will do.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.287
Okay.

41:45.378 --> 41:48.370
I just need a credit card and license.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.579
Yeah.

41:55.555 --> 41:56.761
Thank you.

42:01.686 --> 42:04.519
Do you give a discount
to government employees?

42:07.734 --> 42:09.975
Yeah, I don't... I don't think so.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.559
No one's ever...

42:12.572 --> 42:15.860
I could call the manager
at home and find out.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.815
No, don't bother.

42:18.828 --> 42:21.410
Are you sure you don't want me
to make a fresh pot?

42:21.497 --> 42:24.489
I just gotta go in the back
and get a new...

42:24.584 --> 42:26.074
If it isn't too much trouble.

42:26.169 --> 42:29.832
No, not at all. Not at all.

42:47.148 --> 42:49.480
Yeah, I just...

44:54.025 --> 44:55.025
Viagra.

44:55.902 --> 44:57.813
And Nitroglycerin.

44:57.904 --> 45:01.897
The combination causes
blood pressure to drop and can be fatal.

45:01.991 --> 45:06.280
Add some sumatriptan, which results
in chest pain that mimics a heart attack.

45:08.039 --> 45:10.200
The threat of death from torture
or a bullet

45:10.291 --> 45:14.375
is not nearly as effective as actually
feeling death is imminent.

46:15.690 --> 46:16.975
I wouldn't.

46:18.359 --> 46:19.974
You want to finish that?

46:29.704 --> 46:31.069
What do you want?

46:32.290 --> 46:33.700
Why are you packing?

46:34.709 --> 46:37.416
- I'm a federal marshal.
- Hmm.

46:37.503 --> 46:40.620
Pretty chintzy room discount
for government employees, don't you think?

46:41.632 --> 46:43.122
Are you a fed?

46:43.217 --> 46:44.582
No.

46:44.677 --> 46:46.417
And neither are you.

46:46.512 --> 46:48.628
But nice try. I've used that line myself.

46:48.723 --> 46:50.714
I had to try.

46:56.522 --> 46:57.978
So, what do you want?

46:58.065 --> 46:59.726
White rivers.

47:00.735 --> 47:01.895
What?

47:01.986 --> 47:04.102
White rivers.

47:04.196 --> 47:05.652
I don't know what you're asking.

47:24.300 --> 47:25.300
"Warning:

47:26.302 --> 47:29.419
Do not use with prescribed
heart medication."

47:30.681 --> 47:34.048
Well, unfortunately you just chugged it
down with two different heart drugs.

47:34.143 --> 47:36.475
- You don't understand.
- You're having a heart attack.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.304
- Call 911.
- I would, but out here in the wastelands,

47:39.398 --> 47:40.888
who knows how long it would take.

47:40.983 --> 47:42.473
For god's sake, just call them.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.809
- White rivers.
- Please!

47:44.904 --> 47:46.735
White rivers.

47:46.822 --> 47:49.404
I don't... I don't...

47:51.660 --> 47:54.697
The heart beats two and a half billion
times during the average lifetime,

47:54.789 --> 47:57.451
but there's only one beat
that really matters.

47:58.459 --> 47:59.574
The next one.

48:11.514 --> 48:13.095
You were careful.

48:16.435 --> 48:18.721
You studied weight-based dosing.

48:21.816 --> 48:25.980
The amount you administered should have
just mimicked a heart attack,

48:26.070 --> 48:28.436
giving you ample time to get
the information you needed

48:28.531 --> 48:30.362
for confirmation of kill.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.373
Just his luck. He had a heart condition.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.619
He was already on borrowed time.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.526
You search for clues on white rivers.

49:41.562 --> 49:44.349
If the authorities find
multiple identities on this guy,

49:44.440 --> 49:48.729
that could get them delving more deeply
into his background and death.

49:53.115 --> 49:55.481
You need to have them think
he's just some schmuck

49:55.576 --> 49:57.988
whose weakened heart finally seized.

50:09.298 --> 50:14.338
Oh, hey, you're back.
Is everything okay?

50:14.428 --> 50:17.761
Yeah, I found this
on the ground near my room.

50:17.848 --> 50:21.636
Thought the guy in the room next to mine
might've dropped it. Jonathan Ford?

50:21.727 --> 50:24.013
Yeah, sounds familiar.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.604
Let me just double-check here.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.603
Yep, that's him.

50:30.694 --> 50:34.562
You know what? I'll just give it back
to him on my way back.

50:34.657 --> 50:36.693
But not until I get that cup of Joe, huh?

50:37.701 --> 50:39.942
Oh. Thanks, mister.

50:40.037 --> 50:44.997
I'll get that...
Yeah, I'll just get that for you.

50:47.211 --> 50:48.621
Jonathan Ford.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.166
Dead.

50:51.257 --> 50:52.918
Of natural causes.

50:55.094 --> 50:57.426
But he's not white rivers.

50:57.513 --> 50:59.754
You need to look into the couple.

51:04.270 --> 51:05.806
Threat.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.727
Kill.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.430
Everything else.

51:09.525 --> 51:12.983
The woman lives in a farmhouse
a few miles away.

51:13.988 --> 51:16.525
The best time to visit is
between midnight and 4:00 A.M.

51:17.533 --> 51:20.900
You have a hard rule:
Eat when you can.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.862
You never know when the chance
will come up again.

51:54.278 --> 51:57.236
Good timing.
I was just about to turn off the stove.

51:57.323 --> 51:59.405
Sure this isn't any trouble?

51:59.491 --> 52:01.027
A man's gotta eat.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.446
Got any specials?

52:05.080 --> 52:06.786
Everything around here is special.

52:09.043 --> 52:12.581
Just as long as you order
burgers and fries.

52:13.922 --> 52:15.128
Cheeseburger.

52:16.383 --> 52:17.793
Are you gonna be hard to please?

52:18.844 --> 52:20.300
If that's what you want.

52:21.305 --> 52:23.387
Oh, so it's about what I want.

52:23.474 --> 52:24.964
Isn't it always?

52:25.976 --> 52:28.342
Mostly. I'll just be a few minutes.

52:44.870 --> 52:46.360
Need any company?

52:47.373 --> 52:50.240
Sure, just give me a few seconds.

53:00.052 --> 53:02.168
Do you mind if I join you?

53:04.098 --> 53:05.679
I'd prefer it if you do.

53:08.936 --> 53:10.301
Want yours toasted?

53:12.272 --> 53:13.432
Sure.

53:19.405 --> 53:21.270
You ever work in a kitchen?

53:23.492 --> 53:24.652
Not as an employee.

53:24.743 --> 53:26.904
"Not as an employee."

53:28.205 --> 53:29.741
What does that even mean?

53:31.625 --> 53:33.240
Have you worked in many kitchens?

53:34.336 --> 53:37.874
Ah, you know, girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

53:39.633 --> 53:40.918
Sometimes we all do.

53:42.970 --> 53:44.380
Yeah, I guess.

53:48.559 --> 53:52.097
Are these gonna be okay? It just saves me
a lot of time cleaning up.

53:53.105 --> 53:54.140
Sure.

53:55.566 --> 53:56.646
You want the works?

53:57.651 --> 53:59.733
Hold the onions.

54:02.156 --> 54:05.114
Oh. An optimist.

54:08.454 --> 54:10.911
What about beer?
There's a couple in the fridge.

54:10.998 --> 54:12.033
Sure.

54:26.889 --> 54:28.470
I'm conflicted.

54:29.892 --> 54:31.257
Conflicted?

54:33.520 --> 54:36.762
Yeah, there's... there's a part of me

54:36.857 --> 54:39.894
that wants to ask you
all the usual questions.

54:39.985 --> 54:44.775
What's your name?
Where are you from? What do you do?

54:45.949 --> 54:48.486
Are you just passing through?

54:48.577 --> 54:49.657
However?

54:50.954 --> 54:55.664
However, you'll be gone in the morning
and I'll never see you again.

54:55.751 --> 54:59.915
So I can either be left
with the memory

55:00.005 --> 55:03.418
of having dinner with a man
that I got to know.

55:03.509 --> 55:04.749
Or...

55:04.843 --> 55:06.003
Or?

55:08.013 --> 55:09.878
Or I can be left with a fantasy.

55:09.973 --> 55:13.636
A fantasy that I can shape and change...

55:14.645 --> 55:15.760
However I want.

55:16.772 --> 55:17.807
So?

55:21.109 --> 55:24.101
I think I'm gonna leave
those questions unasked.

55:32.246 --> 55:33.782
Can we talk about you?

55:37.543 --> 55:38.953
What is it you want?

55:39.044 --> 55:41.080
You mean nowâ?

55:41.171 --> 55:45.335
Like in the next few hours,
or next few years?

55:46.635 --> 55:48.171
Whichever one you're clear about.

55:48.262 --> 55:49.297
Now.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.136
I want to finish my burger,

55:52.224 --> 55:55.091
and then I want to spend the night
in a warm embrace,

55:55.185 --> 55:59.394
the kind that you only get
after great sex.

56:03.819 --> 56:06.185
In the next few years, then.

56:11.785 --> 56:14.527
Over the next few years, I...

56:14.621 --> 56:17.579
I want to... triumph.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.124
- Over what?
- What do you got?

56:23.589 --> 56:24.669
What about you?

56:25.757 --> 56:29.295
You got any dreams, solitary man?

56:33.223 --> 56:35.088
Mom! [Ook out!

56:38.061 --> 56:39.301
You all right there, partner?

56:41.899 --> 56:43.059
No.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.274
No dreams.

56:49.156 --> 56:53.149
Before, when you were asking me
about white rivers...

56:54.995 --> 56:56.531
What is that?

56:58.248 --> 57:01.240
I'm not sure. Just wanted
to know what it was.

57:02.252 --> 57:05.164
Well, I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.999
I know what it's like to want something.

57:12.012 --> 57:13.127
Okay.

57:14.765 --> 57:16.756
I have some things to do. Thank you.

57:27.027 --> 57:28.767
I'm staying at the motel.

57:30.864 --> 57:33.071
You mean the only one in town?

58:07.985 --> 58:09.145
One minute.

59:45.749 --> 59:48.035
Maybe I'm a little rusty.

59:49.961 --> 59:52.794
That's some strange foreplay
you got going on there.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.417
What do you want?

59:57.135 --> 59:59.217
I thought that was obvious.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:08.764
Hey.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.391
Who sent you?

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.264
Okay, this is getting weird now.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.613
Wow.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:22.569
I guess I misread
the signals back there.

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:28.071
My bag?

01:00:35.882 --> 01:00:37.338
Tell me...

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:40.542
About white rivers.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.716
Again with this white rivers.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.179
Just my luck.

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.636
The first time I meet
an interesting man in a while,

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.686
and look what happens.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.769
No weapons.

01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:59.648
What was your plan?

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:05.784
Can we just agree that this is a mistake
and just let me go?

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:09.120
I promise I won't call the cops.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.116
- Why didn't you know the deputy?
- What?

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.210
Back at the diner, the deputy,
you didn't know him.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:15.994
How is that possible in this town?

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.626
Rosie, she's my aunt, she's the owner.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:21.795
She's not well. It's...

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:23.923
It's cancer, if you really must know.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.473
So I thought I'd come up here
to this godforsaken town

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.051
to help out, do a good deed.
Look what I get.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:35.472
Besides, something was off
about the deputy anyways.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:38.145
What do you mean?

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.610
I'm not sure.

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:42.980
Just a feeling.

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:48.485
His badge didn't look real.
Isn't it supposed to have numbers on it?

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.337
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.725
I had to be sure.

01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:15.853
Okay.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:19.315
Whatever you say.

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:24.653
Why don't I just...

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:28.325
Why don't I just leave
and we'll forget the whole thing?

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.161
Hmm.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.284
Mm-hmm.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:35.622
Thank you.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:56.177
Well, that was something.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:01.808
Fuck me.

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:07.531
Okay. Now I'll probably get killed
in a car accident

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.653
trying to find my aunt's house.
This is great.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.869
Wait.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.784
What now?

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:17.240
Come back inside.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.748
I don't think so.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:22.830
Had my fair share
of excitement for the night.

01:03:22.924 --> 01:03:24.960
I'm just gonna take my chances.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:28.919
Just... just until the snow stops.

01:03:29.014 --> 01:03:30.379
Please.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:33.882
Okay.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.518
No funny stuff.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:47.270
Your first concern
on a night assault is dogs.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.273
The fact that it's been quiet
so far can be misleading.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:55.983
On nights like this, only the most cruel
of owners leave their dogs out.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:18.176
Experience has taught you
that homes this remote are often unlocked.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:22.058
It's possible the front door
may be locked.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.352
But unlikely all of them are.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.282
Most owners feed their dogs
in the kitchen.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:21.030
You search for a water dish.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.326
You know things don't
always go as planned.

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.453
Best to minimize access
to potential weapons.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:33.039
If things go awry, you gain a few seconds
while your quarry is confused.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:53.446
Collateral damage. It happens.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:56.824
You know that.

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:05.651
Do not... rush.

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:12.404
Do not... hesitate.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.116
Do not get distracted.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:22.918
Do not question.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.228
This is interesting.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.111
No white rivers.

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:45.122
You've been taught that,
in this situation,

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:48.170
it's best to appear
like a burglary gone bad.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.122
You take cash, credit cards,

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:53.209
even a few things of minimal value,
and ransack the place.

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:14.160
If this is the real deputy Myers,

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:16.878
then who's in the house?

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.718
You can't risk starting the car.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:53.642
Plumes from the tailpipe will act just
like a smoke-filled beacon.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.811
No bars.

01:18:56.899 --> 01:18:59.481
You hope the same is true
for the impostor.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:02.275
You hope that he leaves
the scene quickly.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:05.730
But if he doesn't leave soon,
you're going to have to risk it.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:03.830
Got a bit of a problem here.

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:08.084
Yeah, I can see that.
Did you call for help?

01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:12.137
Well, my radio, I think it went out
when I went off the road.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:14.215
Tried my cell. No signal.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.766
Huh.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.428
Just my cell.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:22.682
Yeah. Me, too. No signal.

01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:24.391
Where you coming from?

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:26.859
Fast.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:33.276
You know anything about a burglary
few miles back?

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:35.406
Burglary? Can't say that I do.

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:39.831
You see, I got a 911 call,
which by itself is unusual in this town.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.667
It's the home of a local woman.

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:46.004
Even more unusual, at the scene,

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:48.707
there's a man shot dead
in one of the bedrooms.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:53.963
And it looks like the woman
was there, possibly wounded.

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:56.174
But there's no sign of her now.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.806
I saw you at the diner.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:03.813
Wow, you are extremely observant.

01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:07.359
Well, I go to Rosie's earlier.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:10.529
There's nothing but friendly faces.

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:13.608
And this time, it's all different.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:18.822
It's unusual to see
so many unfamiliar faces in these parts.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:24.543
So you go to Rosie's
for dinner every night at 5:00?

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:29.249
You gonna make some kind
of smart remark about that, too?

01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:32.085
Sorry. Can I ask you a question?

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:37.136
White rivers... are you familiar with it?

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:40.764
White rivers? Yeah.

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:42.094
I know it.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:43.850
I just had to be certain.

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.698
I've been racking my brain.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.957
What does it mean?

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:51.964
You calm your heart,
quiet your breath.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.790
You take in every sound.

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:50.772
You've completed your mission.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.851
Not a complete success,
due to the collateral damage,

01:23:53.946 --> 01:23:56.904
but in the long run,
it makes no difference.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.572
Seven billion people on the planet,

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.867
and even with medical advances,
the odds are,

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:04.912
in only 130 years, maybe less,

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:08.616
every single person
currently alive will be dead.

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:11.539
Seven billion.

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:14.963
Your work doesn't even equate
to a rounding error.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:23.180
You don't even understand why you care.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:26.475
But you do hope they make it
to the woman in time.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:12.979
You all right?

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:15.853
Yeah.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:18.686
(Guess so.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.482
Just finished.

01:25:24.494 --> 01:25:26.109
So everything went okay?

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:29.742
It's good to hear from you.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:31.118
Thanks.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:35.832
There was one slight hitch.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.631
Another civilian.

01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:43.134
Not like the last one.

01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:45.633
So everything was cleaned up?

01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:49.967
You'd better get back here
as quick as you can.

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.222
I will.

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:55.013
Just need some rest.

01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:59.476
And one last loose end.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:02.737
I oose end?

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.482
Something personal.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.451
Oh, yeah?

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.373
Something on your mind?

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:17.546
It's just...

01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:26.466
I keep seeing them burning.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:29.844
Yeah, I know.

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:32.767
Sorry, kid.

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.515
Get back as soon as you can.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.651
I'll be waiting.

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.591
Did you go out?

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:33.718
- Just checked the roads.
- For me? Heh.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.387
That's so sweet.

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:44.066
I can't believe I... I actually slept.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.605
Considering.

01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:54.653
I mean, you could've done all kinds of
unspeakable things to me, but you didn't.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.660
Maybe you're not a bad guy after all.

01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:05.745
What do you say, cowboy?

01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:11.126
Life's short.

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:42.884
You check out today?

01:30:45.982 --> 01:30:47.472
Most likely.

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:52.394
I can't wait to get out of this town.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:54.904
It's that bad?

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:59.447
Why? You planning on moving here?

01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:02.282
Thought not.

01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:07.083
Where would you go?

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:10.714
Anywhere.

01:31:11.675 --> 01:31:13.461
Anywhere?

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:14.551
I don't know.

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:18.878
Florida, maybe.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:22.511
You ask anywhere...

01:31:24.187 --> 01:31:27.725
And then you pick Florida?

01:31:33.405 --> 01:31:34.861
Okay, Italy.

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:37.605
Southern Italy.

01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:40.450
It shows in Rome.

01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:41.537
Hmm.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.996
It must be beautiful when it does.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.083
Do you speak Italian?

01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:52.753
I studied Spanish in school.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:55.423
It's kind of the same thing, right?

01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:05.717
There are...

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.220
Some good things here.

01:32:11.484 --> 01:32:12.940
Name one.

01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:35.421
I'm just gonna go freshen up, okay?

01:33:26.392 --> 01:33:29.304
White rivers.

01:33:30.563 --> 01:33:32.554
Small world. Please sit wherever you want.

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.395
- Dixy.
- Yeah, like the cup.

01:33:36.486 --> 01:33:38.397
Most people, they see "Dee."

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:41.150
Rosie, she's my aunt.
She's the owner.

01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:43.135
She's not well. It's cancer,
if you really must know.

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:44.899
- Why didn't you know the deputy?
- What?

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:46.931
Back at the diner, the deputy,
you didn't know him.

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:48.616
How is that possible in this town?

01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:50.742
Deputy Myers.

01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:07.965
- Fake.
- Mostly.

01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:10.018
Yours?

01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:12.310
Mostly.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.679
Did you kill them all?

01:34:20.446 --> 01:34:21.561
Yes.

01:34:21.656 --> 01:34:23.317
(Go on.

01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:27.025
The coroner's report
will show a heart attack.

01:34:28.413 --> 01:34:30.404
- Nitro and...
- Viagra.

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.661
Ah. That's always a fun combination.

01:34:35.545 --> 01:34:36.876
The others?

01:34:36.963 --> 01:34:38.544
Burglary gone bad.

01:34:40.675 --> 01:34:44.042
It'll look like the deputy pulled over
the bad guys leaving the scene.

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:52.726
And each one of them...
Gunning for you.

01:34:55.982 --> 01:34:57.222
Not for me.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:00.775
I got there early.

01:35:01.779 --> 01:35:04.566
Watched you all saunter in.

01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:07.023
That was my plan.

01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:09.651
Except I stopped to...

01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:11.202
Ride?

01:35:18.004 --> 01:35:20.120
It goes that way sometimes.

01:35:21.299 --> 01:35:22.914
I had to kill the cook.

01:35:27.972 --> 01:35:30.429
And aunt Rosie.

01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:39.810
I didn't know there was a cook.

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:41.732
Well, he's in the basement now.

01:35:43.279 --> 01:35:45.440
Which one showed up first?

01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:47.362
First was an innocent.

01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:52.952
Local girl, she'd just finished work.

01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:54.654
Came in for a bite.

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:56.705
I thought they might've been a couple.

01:35:56.793 --> 01:35:58.374
Ah, no.

01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:01.669
Handsome Johnnie came strolling on in,

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:04.122
instantly started wooing the girl.

01:36:05.802 --> 01:36:09.886
Now, what is a beautiful woman like you
doing eating alone?

01:36:09.973 --> 01:36:11.088
Coming from this town,

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:14.845
I think she... thought her prayers
had been answered.

01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:18.428
It's just her bad luck.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440
The loner?

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:23.478
Came in right after the gigolo.

01:36:25.488 --> 01:36:28.901
Saft, waited for you.

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:31.900
For me?

01:36:32.912 --> 01:36:34.777
Now you're just catching on.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:38.827
I can tell you
I wasn't thrilled to see him there.

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:48.333
What about the deputy?

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:51.760
I wasn't sure at first.

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:55.840
Then I was.

01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:08.444
I wouldn't go over there now.

01:37:08.531 --> 01:37:10.738
That guy on the end, I think he has a gun.

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:13.157
Keeps asking about a white rivers.

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:16.574
I ain't never seen him around here before.

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:18.746
You're getting too old
for this kind of work.

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:22.075
Finish your coffee and leave him to me.

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:26.421
Have a nice big tip for you.

01:37:27.425 --> 01:37:28.881
I'll bet you do.

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.721
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:37:55.995 --> 01:37:57.986
I never saw you coming.

01:37:58.081 --> 01:38:01.619
You see what you want to see.

01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:06.668
Look inside the passport.

01:38:23.398 --> 01:38:26.936
You read your own name.

01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:32.028
Contact me when it's done.

01:38:50.883 --> 01:38:53.499
And here I was thinking
that I screwed up.

01:38:56.722 --> 01:38:58.838
Had to eliminate them all
just to be sure.

01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:01.091
No.

01:39:02.103 --> 01:39:03.388
You were right.

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.812
Except...

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:08.264
About you.

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:13.061
What about...

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:18.365
What about just now?

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:21.235
The old man cares about you.

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.160
Something on your mind?

01:39:26.252 --> 01:39:29.039
I keep seeing them burning.

01:39:30.047 --> 01:39:31.412
Yeah, I know.

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:34.210
I'm sorry, kid.

01:39:35.261 --> 01:39:38.753
- White rivers?
- He never lied to you.

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:42.594
He wanted you to be content.

01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:45.764
Happy, almost.

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:48.725
How?

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:52.058
Well, that was my choice.

01:40:00.953 --> 01:40:02.409
Are you happy?

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:06.781
It's just...

01:40:09.295 --> 01:40:10.660
At my cabin.

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:15.710
Just...

01:40:17.803 --> 01:40:19.919
Check the trunk of my car, all right?

01:40:34.153 --> 01:40:37.520
The choice is yours.

01:40:46.374 --> 01:40:47.580
I know.

01:41:21.993 --> 01:41:23.278
It's done.

01:41:58.404 --> 01:42:00.144
Feliz navidad.

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:40.230
You've really come to hate mob jobs.

01:42:40.321 --> 01:42:42.152
They're just too messy.

01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:45.652
And sometimes the other side
takes it personally.

01:42:45.743 --> 01:42:49.702
You decide from now on, you'll only take
corporate or government work.

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:53.077
The intel is better.
It's thorough, it's complete.

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:57.456
Allows time for planning, time to mitigate
problems, prepare contingencies.

01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:03.382
But rules are important
and need to be followed.

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:09.342
And a promise needs to be kept.

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:19.064
After all, you're an Ace, an expert.

01:43:19.151 --> 01:43:20.641
A professional.

01:43:20.736 --> 01:43:24.570
Some might even say... a virtuoso.
