Star Trek: Discovery...

00:12.316 --> 00:14.275
BOOK:
Pull up Kwejian
on the deep-space array.

00:14.318 --> 00:17.147
-BURNHAM: What happened?
-My ship was hit by something.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.931
BOOK:
They're gone.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.803
STAMETS:
Five light-years across.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.893
That's the size
of the gravitational anomaly

00:23.936 --> 00:25.068
that hit Kwejian.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.243
The DMA disappeared.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.812
It reappeared 4.2 seconds later,

00:29.855 --> 00:31.901
1,000 light-years away.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.859
BURNHAM:
The only logical explanation

00:33.903 --> 00:35.296
is someone created it.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.211
VANCE:
For now, we're classifying

00:37.254 --> 00:40.301
those responsible
as Unknown Species Ten-C.

00:40.344 --> 00:44.566
ZORA:
Thank you, Commander,
for reaching toward me.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.134
-GRAY: What are those?
-The coordinates.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.832
-To Species Ten-C.
-I'm struggling.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.095
The DMA has brought up
a lot of, uh, uncertainty.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.792
You are only human.

00:53.836 --> 00:56.360
If you don't find fulfillment
in something other than work,

00:56.404 --> 00:59.885
then you will fail those
in the chair in front of you.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.322
And I designed this.

01:01.365 --> 01:04.107
A weapon capable
of destroying the DMA.

01:04.151 --> 01:07.328
A "cascading subspace burst"
sounds a lot like the result

01:07.371 --> 01:08.981
of an isolytic explosion.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.418
My proposal carries some risk,

01:10.461 --> 01:12.463
but not nearly as much
as doing nothing.

01:12.507 --> 01:14.944
We need to defend ourselves.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.641
BURNHAM:
If we make first contact
peacefully,

01:16.685 --> 01:19.340
then we can determine intent
before we act.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.951
Introducing the next generation
spore drive.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.648
We have 94 seconds
before they realize it's gone

01:23.692 --> 01:26.216
and figure out I'm the one
who took it.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.479
Next part's all you.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.177
Book. No.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.016
VANCE:
I need Booker's ship found.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.018
Scramble every available vessel.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.542
Eisenbergclass, shuttle,
I don't care.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.326
They've stolen classified tech.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.154
Do we have any idea where it is?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.503
Negative, sir. It spore-jumped.

01:52.547 --> 01:53.852
-Any idea where it's headed?
-Not yet, sir.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.680
All available personnel
are looking.

01:55.724 --> 01:58.292
Can anyone please tell me,
how the hell did our prototype

01:58.335 --> 01:59.858
get out in the first place?

01:59.902 --> 02:02.034
Security requires dual
authorization, does it not?

02:02.078 --> 02:03.645
Yes, sir.
It has dual authorization.

02:03.688 --> 02:04.863
Uh, Ruon Tarka entered
his code somehow

02:04.907 --> 02:06.256
in conjunction with, uh...

02:08.954 --> 02:11.087
...yours, sir.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.220
RILLAK:
Admiral.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.529
I'll ask you both just once.

02:18.573 --> 02:21.271
Did you have any idea
this was coming?

02:21.315 --> 02:24.187
-BOTH: No, Madam President.
-Okay, then,

02:24.231 --> 02:27.843
how did you have no idea
it was coming?

02:27.886 --> 02:31.194
Tarka was your guy, Admiral.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.109
Handpicked.
You gave him free reign.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.458
Barely any oversight.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.069
And it is one thing to miss
the capacity

02:37.113 --> 02:39.898
for criminal misbehavior
in a professional relationship,

02:39.942 --> 02:41.552
but yours was also personal.

02:41.596 --> 02:44.729
I knew Book was struggling,
but he... he gave no indication

02:44.773 --> 02:47.167
that he would do
something like this.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.256
Hmm.

02:50.822 --> 02:54.130
That spore drive technology
is the closest we have come

02:54.174 --> 02:56.915
to ending
our dilithium dependence.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.353
If word gets out that
the only functional prototype

02:59.396 --> 03:03.400
has been stolen,
it will threaten everything.

03:03.444 --> 03:06.751
Including trust
that we have the ability

03:06.795 --> 03:11.103
to pull off this monumental
first contact mission

03:11.147 --> 03:14.063
that you just helped to sell
a few hours ago.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.413
That doesn't even
take into account

03:16.457 --> 03:18.589
the risk we now run of provoking

03:18.633 --> 03:21.766
a highly advanced species
who are capable

03:21.810 --> 03:24.726
of destroying us all,
if Booker and Tarka succeed.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.815
BURNHAM:
With all due respect, ma'am,

03:26.858 --> 03:28.773
he's a good man
who's not thinking clearly.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.167
He's grieving, he's-he's dealing
with unimaginable loss.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.169
He thinks he's preventing
another Kwejian.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.867
We are trying to prevent
something even worse.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.435
I can get him to see that
before it's too late.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.872
In order to build
an isolytic weapon,

03:40.916 --> 03:42.613
Tarka needs isolynium.

03:42.657 --> 03:45.268
That's a black-market element
that is not easy to track down.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.661
That buys us time to find them.

03:46.704 --> 03:49.098
Discovery'sprimary repairs
are done.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.273
We can leave immediately.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.448
I know you want to help,
Captain.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.058
But you're too close to this.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.322
You cannot be involved.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.280
I'm told Intelligence
has identified four vendors

03:57.324 --> 04:00.152
who are believed to have access
to isolynium.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.937
I'm deploying ships
to all locations

04:01.980 --> 04:05.027
with orders to detain
Booker and Tarka on sight.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.377
Good. In the meantime, I'd ask

04:07.421 --> 04:10.380
that Discoverygather data
on Species Ten-C.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.948
We have to prepare
for a first contact,

04:12.991 --> 04:16.038
provided our rogue associates
don't beat us to it.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.214
I agree.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.522
You have your orders,
Captain Burnham.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.784
Dismissed.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.014
TARKA:
So, how'd it feel?

04:36.058 --> 04:37.320
The spore drive.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.583
The interface. Efficiency.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.282
Hit me. Come on, you're
the first real beta tester.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.806
-It's impressive.
-Oh, come on, now.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.329
Specifics.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.505
It works.
It'll help us stop the DMA.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.202
That's all that matters to me.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.467
Can't fault your honesty.

04:53.510 --> 04:56.687
We're safe for now,
out of scanner range.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.733
How long do you need
to build the weapon?

04:58.776 --> 05:00.256
24 hours should do it.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.606
-[trilling]
-She's hailing you again.

05:03.477 --> 05:07.089
Yeah. And there's this, too.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.788
TARKA:
Well, it's not the most
flattering picture of me,

05:10.832 --> 05:12.703
but you, you look fantastic.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.708
It's not lost on me, what
you're giving up to do this.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.711
It's worth it, whatever
my sentence turns out to be.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.234
Your sentence?

05:22.278 --> 05:24.541
Once billions of lives
are saved, you'll be a hero.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.761
That's not how
the Federation works.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.417
You had half the assembly
eating out of your hand.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.333
-We still lost the vote.
-Rillak's a political animal.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.812
Once the DMA is gone,

05:34.856 --> 05:36.901
she'll face political pressure
to pardon us.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.077
She'll find a way to explain
that, in this case,

05:39.121 --> 05:40.775
the ends justified the means.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.647
Let's just worry about saving
the billions of lives first.

05:43.691 --> 05:46.346
Okay?

05:47.216 --> 05:48.783
Very well.

05:50.306 --> 05:52.395
Once you've secured us
some isolynium,

05:52.439 --> 05:55.790
-I can finish
the third phase of...
-Wait, what?

05:55.833 --> 05:58.314
You made it sound like
you knew exactly how to get it.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.707
I was counting
on the Federation's help.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.013
-We don't have that now.
-Unbelievable.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.363
What's the issue here?

06:03.406 --> 06:04.712
I thought couriers
could find anything.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.409
Buying something
that's dangerous and rare

06:06.453 --> 06:08.455
is never easy, especially
with Starfleet on our asses.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.156
[low beeping]

06:15.723 --> 06:19.422
I know a place
that won't be on their radar.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.119
But it's gonna cost us.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.600
See? That's the spirit.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.473
And don't worry,

06:41.183 --> 06:43.272

06:48.669 --> 06:51.454
I first met Ruon Tarka

06:51.498 --> 06:54.457
when he was giving a lecture
ten years ago.

06:54.501 --> 06:58.809
One of the most brilliant minds
I've ever encountered.

06:58.853 --> 07:02.639
He had all these ideas
for new propulsion systems

07:02.683 --> 07:05.120
and power sources.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.731
Made it sound like
anything was possible.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.300
And I believed him.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.609
I still do.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.655
I keep asking myself,

07:18.699 --> 07:20.352
why would he do this?

07:20.396 --> 07:22.485
What am I missing?

07:24.748 --> 07:27.011
Sir, I wish I had answers.

07:29.100 --> 07:33.061
Maybe Tarka couldn't handle the
council voting down his plan?

07:34.366 --> 07:36.281
He has quite the ego...

07:38.066 --> 07:40.677
...but I don't think that's it.

07:45.595 --> 07:48.424
I just got my family back,
Captain.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.604
The thought that I will have
to send them away again,

07:54.648 --> 07:58.695
for their protection, because
someone I brought into the fold

07:58.739 --> 08:02.917
might invite a war that
we couldn't possibly win...

08:02.960 --> 08:04.571
We will figure this out.

08:04.614 --> 08:08.879
And I will do everything in my
power to help make things right.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.403
I think we can both agree
that Booker's not foolish enough

08:11.447 --> 08:15.103
to buy isolynium
from any of the known suspects.

08:16.757 --> 08:20.456
Sir, you and President Rillak
were pretty clear.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.720
Yes, and it's very important for
the Federation president and I

08:23.764 --> 08:25.548
to present a united front,

08:25.592 --> 08:29.117
so I would never
publicly contradict her.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.554
But I can take a page
out of her own book

08:31.598 --> 08:35.558

Data on what lies
beyond the galactic barrier

is extremely limited.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.139
That gap in the center?

11:02.183 --> 11:03.445
Is that where the Ten-C
are located?

11:03.488 --> 11:06.317
Well, um, like I said,
it's limited.

11:06.361 --> 11:11.496
But the orbit of
the extragalactic stars nearby

11:11.540 --> 11:14.456
indicate a significant
gravitational presence.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.850
There's definitely
something there.

11:16.893 --> 11:20.070
To find out what,
we'll need a visual on the area.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.550
Any idea how to do that?

-Zora?
-ZORA: Yes, Commander Stamets.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.902
I may have something.

The sphere data has records

They're warp-capable.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.783
So they're advanced enough
and close enough

11:36.826 --> 11:38.349
that their standard
stellar surveys

11:38.393 --> 11:40.047
should cover the area we need.

11:40.090 --> 11:43.703
Zora, has the Federation ever
crossed paths with the Stilph?

11:43.746 --> 11:46.706
No. And no diplomatic
relations exist.

11:46.749 --> 11:49.534
But they've dealt with
the Orions in the past.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.450
Mm. Rather complicated

hoping to be the next Osyraa.
Yeah, I know.

36:21.483 --> 36:23.311
Yeah, so, we don't agree
on a lot of things right now,

36:23.355 --> 36:26.271
but we both know
they cannot get the isolynium.

36:26.314 --> 36:28.273
I don't plan
on losing it to them.

36:28.316 --> 36:30.971
Or to you, for that matter.

36:31.014 --> 36:32.233
You're great at Leonian Poker.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.017
You're a hell of a lot better
than me.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.845
But you're no sure thing.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.847
No one is.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.241
-So?
-So,

36:40.285 --> 36:42.156
you remember Schaefer Colony?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.462
BOOK:
Mm-hmm.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.421
Odds can be modified

36:46.465 --> 36:49.207

Next!

36:56.344 --> 36:58.607
I got your pretty star pictures.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.783
I knew you'd come through.

37:00.827 --> 37:04.309
Want a Tetryonic Dosimeter
to measure potency?

37:04.352 --> 37:05.832
-No, thank you.
-[chuckles]

37:05.875 --> 37:08.356
Isolynium has the same
metallic luster as pyrite,

37:08.400 --> 37:10.445
and its crystals are equant,

37:10.489 --> 37:14.188
meaning they have
roughly equal dimensions.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.364
When cut with impurities,

37:16.408 --> 37:19.541
opacity and shape
are affected, so...

37:19.585 --> 37:22.240
Learn a lot of useful things
as a courier.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.589
This is the real deal.

37:23.632 --> 37:26.461
I don't know what's happening
between you two,

37:26.505 --> 37:29.029

for love,

37:29.072 --> 37:30.596

37:30.639 --> 37:33.338

38:54.723 --> 38:56.551
You know, I...

38:56.595 --> 38:59.337
I played a game once
at Schaefer Colony.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.773
There-there was this guy

39:00.816 --> 39:03.036
on a new wardrobe,
thinking it was his night,

39:03.079 --> 39:04.994
only to go home
in the emperor's new clothes

39:05.038 --> 39:07.388
on a flush draw.
[chuckles softly]

39:07.432 --> 39:10.217

what's your opinion

41:10.642 --> 41:13.601
I assume
you toe the company line?

41:13.645 --> 41:17.300
I actually understand
why you saw this as a way to go.

-Hmm.
-Still a gigantic risk.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.610

41:22.654 --> 41:25.134
And to do this against
the advice and will of so many

41:29.704 --> 41:32.359
I'm not surprised
you think that.

41:33.142 --> 41:34.883
What is it, then?

You're the Federation's
genius darling.

Why throw it all away?
Makes no damn sense.

41:38.887 --> 41:41.803
I couldn't care less what
the Federation thinks of me.

41:41.847 --> 41:43.109
It's not about them.

Died?

41:52.161 --> 41:54.468
So this is, what, revenge?

41:54.512 --> 41:57.210
You're getting back at someone?

41:59.908 --> 42:02.868
Or keeping a promise, maybe,
to that someone who died.

42:02.911 --> 42:06.393
Okay, you're boring me.
Go stand somewhere else.

42:11.267 --> 42:14.227
I know what it is
to lose someone.

You can choose to make
something good come out of it.

of loss,

how much choice one has

You'd leave me no choice.

43:39.660 --> 43:42.402
Starfleet will come after you
with everything they've got.

43:43.229 --> 43:45.666
I'll be one of the tools
they use.

Congratulations, Glow-Worm.

I'm sorry.

TARKA:
Sacrifice is always heavy.

45:46.961 --> 45:49.877
And though doing it for
the right reasons should help,

45:49.921 --> 45:52.358
it never does.

45:58.277 --> 46:02.455
In time, I do believe Burnham
and others will understand.

46:03.891 --> 46:06.067
Maybe.

46:06.111 --> 46:08.113
The only thing
that would be worse

46:08.156 --> 46:10.942
is that sacrifice done
for nothing.

46:10.985 --> 46:13.640
Hmm. [sighs]

46:13.683 --> 46:16.338
So let's do
what we came here to do--

46:16.382 --> 46:18.688
end the DMA.

46:18.732 --> 46:22.431
For good.

46:22.475 --> 46:23.868
RILLAK:
As I understood it,

46:23.911 --> 46:26.653
you were gathering data
for first contact

46:26.696 --> 46:29.177
and doing nothing else.

46:29.221 --> 46:31.701
I was there to acquire
a rare set of stellar surveys.

46:31.745 --> 46:33.616
Thought it would shed some light
on what's located

46:33.660 --> 46:35.053
at the 10-C's coordinates.

46:35.096 --> 46:36.750
They're being analyzed now.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.796
Did I hope to run into Book
in the process?

46:38.839 --> 46:41.973
Yes, that is also true.

46:42.016 --> 46:43.975
I can't help but be impressed
by your ability

46:44.018 --> 46:46.151
to navigate a loophole, Captain.

46:46.194 --> 46:50.285
Wouldn't be surprised if you had
some inspiration, either.

46:50.329 --> 46:52.897
I am troubled, however,
that you were not able

46:52.940 --> 46:55.508
to make your loophole count.

46:55.551 --> 46:58.424
You should have found a way to
drag Booker and Tarka back here.

46:58.467 --> 47:00.208
With respect, Madam President,

47:00.252 --> 47:02.950
she was outside
Federation territory,

47:02.994 --> 47:05.866
without a weapon, without
a badge, without authority.

47:05.910 --> 47:10.131
Be that as it may, she literally
bet it all, and lost.

47:10.175 --> 47:14.527
Not quite. Book is incredible
at Leonian Poker,

47:14.570 --> 47:16.964
so going into the game, I
already knew that I would lose.

47:17.008 --> 47:21.447
So, I made the best play
that I could with the hand

47:21.490 --> 47:22.796
that I was dealt.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.276
When cut with impurities,

47:24.319 --> 47:26.321
opacity and shape
are affected, so...

47:26.365 --> 47:27.888
I planted a tracker.

47:27.932 --> 47:30.848
Same kind Starfleet put
in dilithium shipments

47:30.891 --> 47:33.067
back when deliveries were
being stolen.

47:33.111 --> 47:36.157
And as you may remember,
Madam President,

47:36.201 --> 47:39.204
the signal can be detected
from multiple sectors away.

47:46.515 --> 47:51.869
Not many people have the ability
to surprise me, Captain Burnham.

47:51.912 --> 47:54.262
I won't deny
what Book means to me.

47:56.961 --> 48:01.052
But I also won't compromise
my commitment

48:01.095 --> 48:03.924
to the safety of the
Federation and everyone in it.

48:05.926 --> 48:07.885
They're not moving.

48:07.928 --> 48:10.583
Tarka's assembling the weapon.

48:11.453 --> 48:14.543
We'll only have one shot
at surprising them.

48:14.587 --> 48:15.936
It has to count.

48:15.980 --> 48:17.851
We'll begin mission-planning
immediately.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.245
SARU:
Apologies for the interruption,
Admiral,

48:20.288 --> 48:21.768
but Commander Stamets

48:21.811 --> 48:23.422
has something very important
to show you.

48:23.465 --> 48:25.685
It cannot wait.

48:26.947 --> 48:30.255
This is what we found
at the species' coordinates.

48:32.039 --> 48:34.041
Their
technological capabilities

48:34.085 --> 48:36.957
are beyond
our wildest assumptions.

48:37.001 --> 48:38.698
How do you conclude that
from this?

48:38.741 --> 48:40.918
It looks like a... blob.

48:40.961 --> 48:42.963
Natural astrophysical objects

48:43.007 --> 48:45.444
emit a broad spectrum
of black body radiation.

48:45.487 --> 48:47.054
This does not.

48:47.098 --> 48:49.317
Therefore,
it can only be artificial.

48:49.361 --> 48:51.929
And, whatever it is,

48:51.972 --> 48:55.715
it's 228 million kilometers
in radius.

48:55.758 --> 48:57.717
That's enough
to contain a host star

48:57.760 --> 49:00.763
with two
or three orbiting bodies.

49:00.807 --> 49:03.418
Any signals being emitted
from inside of this thing?

49:03.462 --> 49:05.203
None that we can register.

49:05.246 --> 49:08.946
The structure--
a hyperfield of some kind--

49:08.989 --> 49:11.731
seems to function
as some sort of Faraday cage.

49:11.774 --> 49:14.864
We have no way
of knowing what's inside.

49:14.908 --> 49:16.562
Must be astronomical,
the amount of energy

49:16.605 --> 49:18.172
required to maintain that.

49:18.216 --> 49:21.132
VANCE:
Where would
all that energy come from?

49:21.175 --> 49:25.005
Zora, analyze the areas
of space left behind

49:25.049 --> 49:27.138
after the DMA changed location.

49:27.181 --> 49:28.530
What are you thinking?

49:28.574 --> 49:30.271
The remaining gases
and elements should all fall

49:30.315 --> 49:32.099
within known
statistical parameters,

49:32.143 --> 49:36.277
but if something specific
is missing, like boronite...

49:36.321 --> 49:38.845
Boronite. Of course!

49:38.888 --> 49:41.239
Mr. Saru, if you don't mind?

49:41.282 --> 49:44.546
Boronite is an element
that forms naturally,

49:44.590 --> 49:47.027
albeit
in infinitesimal quantities.

49:47.071 --> 49:51.162
In sufficient amounts, however,
it can be synthesized

49:51.205 --> 49:54.469
into some of the most powerful
substances in existence.

49:54.513 --> 50:00.040
Would there be enough energy
for this hyperfield of theirs?

50:00.084 --> 50:01.520
And then some.

50:01.563 --> 50:03.696
ZORA:
Your hypothesis was correct,
Captain.

50:03.739 --> 50:05.132
There's no trace of boronite
at any

50:05.176 --> 50:07.352
of the DMA's
prior known locations.

50:07.395 --> 50:08.701
The DMA removed it.

50:08.744 --> 50:10.920
They mined it.

50:10.964 --> 50:13.184
That's the purpose of the DMA.

50:13.227 --> 50:15.186
That's why it seems
to move so randomly.

50:15.229 --> 50:16.622
It's not a weapon.

50:16.665 --> 50:18.058
It's a dredge.

50:18.102 --> 50:20.974
If the DMA is
their mining equipment,

50:21.018 --> 50:23.368
we can only imagine
what their weapons are like.

50:23.411 --> 50:26.023
And if their power supply is
threatened,

50:26.066 --> 50:29.591
it will almost certainly be seen
as a hostile act.

50:30.940 --> 50:33.900
Booker and Tarka
must be stopped.

50:34.683 --> 50:37.208
Whatever the cost.

50:38.209 --> 50:40.733
I know.
