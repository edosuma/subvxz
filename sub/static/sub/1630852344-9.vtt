00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:22.022 --> 00:24.274
-

00:29.112 --> 00:31.698
I can't remember the last time
we had a storm like this.

00:31.781 --> 00:35.493
This is the kind of weird weather that
happens now, thanks to climate change.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.787
I guess Dann wasn't
wrong about everything.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.624
Uh, is raining cats and dogs
really a thing now?

00:42.917 --> 00:44.961
-Hey, guys!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.046
Janet's back!

00:47.130 --> 00:50.508
Looks like these storm clouds
do have a silver lining.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.886
Thought you said
you were never coming back.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.429
-
-I wasn't.

00:54.512 --> 00:58.099
But then Dann gave a bunch of thugs
the order to take us out.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.476
Guess she didn't realize

00:59.559 --> 01:05.273
it would take more than a biker gang
to rub out the Three Janeteers.

01:05.356 --> 01:11.696
Do you not hear how that makes us
sound like a team of janitors?

01:11.780 --> 01:14.199
And is Janet even your name?

01:14.282 --> 01:15.617
And why are you here?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.494
With Dann putting a price on our heads,

01:17.577 --> 01:20.288
the only way we'll be safe
is to take her out for good.

01:20.371 --> 01:24.876
So until that happens, looks like
our only choice is working with you.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.961
Alright! The family is back together!

01:27.045 --> 01:28.797
Not so fast, Toretto.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.632
Once Dann is out of commission,

01:30.715 --> 01:34.052
I'm walking my crew
right back out of here.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.513
Then I guess this is
the team's final mission.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.806
One last ride.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.474
The final roundup.

01:39.557 --> 01:42.560
The burnt fry…

01:43.895 --> 01:46.314
You know, the one you save for last.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.565
Yeah, we got it.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.528
So, give me the download. Where's Dann?
What's she want? What do we know?

01:51.611 --> 01:52.695
Nothing.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.698
Ah, just like old times.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.867
We do have these devices we found.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.620
We can run some tests on them
to find out what they're for.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.087
You ever think
putting your main computer lab

02:09.170 --> 02:13.424
in a novelty head the size of
a Porta Potti wasn't the best idea?

02:13.508 --> 02:17.303
Well, I never expected to jam
a whole football team in here.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.513
I vote we lose Julius.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.890
-We already have Gary, we don't need both.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.308
Aw…

02:22.934 --> 02:27.522
Your value doesn't decrease based on
someone's inability to see your worth.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.774
It feels like it does.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.695
So, what are these things?

02:34.404 --> 02:35.697
Maybe they're transmitters?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.657
Or explosives?

02:37.740 --> 02:38.783
Label makers?

02:39.993 --> 02:43.872
Dann's brain is an AI filing system.
She's obviously very organized.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.916
Hm.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.085
They contain a rare earth component

02:49.169 --> 02:51.671
that was stolen from a government lab
about a month ago.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.674
According to these records,
she stole enough to make 15 of them.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.593
The one I found was here.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.679
The La Brea Tar Pits is here,
90 miles away.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.556
So where are the rest?

03:01.639 --> 03:05.351
There, right in the middle:
Rancho Cucamonga!

03:05.435 --> 03:06.311
Really?

03:06.394 --> 03:09.147
I don't know. I just
really like to say Rancho Cucamonga.

03:09.230 --> 03:12.609
Rancho Cucamonga! Monga, monga.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.905
We've got to hurry up and find out
what these things are for, okay?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.616
According to Matsuo,
Dann's AI logic is fading.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.660
That means she's only going to become
more reckless and unstable.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.247
We have two of her devices,
so that should be some kind of advantage.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.793
<i>Yes, we're holding devices</i>

03:30.877 --> 03:34.505
<i>that a machine with no conscience,</i>
<i>no morals, and no heart</i>

03:34.589 --> 03:37.967
<i>desperately needs</i>
<i>to carry out her diabolical plan.</i>

03:38.051 --> 03:39.260
<i>I feel safer already.</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:45.099
If we want to find out what these things
are for, and where the rest are,

03:45.183 --> 03:47.644
we need someplace
with more tech to evaluate them.

03:47.727 --> 03:51.022
We need an agency mobile lab.
Echo, order one for us to use.

03:51.105 --> 03:55.276
Uh, maybe you forgot, but you don't
give the orders around here anymore.

03:55.360 --> 04:01.199
That's why I said,
"Echo, order us a mobile lab."

04:03.159 --> 04:05.995
I got this. This happens
in criminal crews all the time.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.956
-Hey! Mad dogs!

04:08.039 --> 04:11.751
One of you hit the other with a bottle and
settle this, or let's get back to work.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.714
I'm calling the agency.
But-but not because you told me to.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.841
Everyone, keep quiet
while I'm on the phone

04:18.925 --> 04:20.677
so they don't know we're all together.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.928
<i>Queso liquidators.</i>

04:22.011 --> 04:26.599
This is Echo Alpha
2-2-6-9-4 Zulu Tango Bravo.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.310
<i>I need one bucket,</i>
<i>extra spicy, on my pin.</i>

04:29.394 --> 04:31.729
<i>One jalapeño special, copy.</i>

04:47.161 --> 04:49.747
-What was that?
-We got hit by lightning!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.554
-Hey, guys! Hold on!

05:15.023 --> 05:16.274
No!

05:20.236 --> 05:22.572
-It's Dann!
-She's trying to get her gear back.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.698
Block the entrance!

05:25.033 --> 05:27.035
It's a good thing it's so crowded in here!

05:28.536 --> 05:29.996
You're not getting in here!

05:30.079 --> 05:31.998
But if she can't get in, we can't get out.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.003
-Who's steering this thing?

05:42.508 --> 05:44.260
I don't know if we can hold her off.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.767
Was that thunder?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.065
-Gotcha!

05:58.441 --> 05:59.942
-Tony!
-Where'd he go?

06:00.026 --> 06:02.653
I don't know, but we gotta
get out of here before we sink.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.406
There's a branch up ahead!

06:41.192 --> 06:43.444
We made it.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.695
But where's Tony?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.995
Whoa!

07:23.734 --> 07:27.780
Man, I hate rain. Shoes all squishy.

07:27.864 --> 07:32.034
-This is how you get the jungle rot.
-Don't worry about the jungle rot, Cisco.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.871
-I can take care of you.
-Aw, thanks man.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.999
I've amputated more toes
than you can shake a stick at.

07:38.082 --> 07:42.795
You hardly miss 'em. In fact,
I think plain feet are just as beautiful.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.797
Oh. Thanks, man.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.009
Are you sure we should be going
right back to the garage?

07:48.092 --> 07:50.595
You remember Dann attacked us
there, like, an hour ago.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.014
The mobile lab
will arrive there in ten minutes,

07:53.097 --> 07:54.765
and we need it to study the devices.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.060
Plus I lost my phone in the river
and can't call to have it come to us.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.104
Plus, our cars are there.

08:00.188 --> 08:04.150
Plus, I'm in charge,
so just zip it and keep walking!

08:05.359 --> 08:06.527
Remind you of anyone?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.280
I was never this emotional
when I ran the crew.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.116
You were the very model of temperance.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.869
I hope Tony's okay.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.455
He'll be fine.
That puddinhead is so lucky,

08:17.538 --> 08:20.291
that cyborg will knock him
into buried treasure or something.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.375
Yeah.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.711
Yeah, uh, yeah, he'll make it.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.547
Listen, I'm worried about Tony, too.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.841
We just gotta hang in there
and get through this.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.303
Help is on the way from the agency
and we still have Dann's devices,

08:32.386 --> 08:33.679
so we're one step ahead.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.432
-Toretto can take care of himself.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.185
Let's just stay on mission. Right, chief?

08:40.061 --> 08:40.895
Right.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.694
<i>Queso liquidators.</i>

08:48.778 --> 08:52.698
This is Echo Alpha
2-2-6-9-4 Zulu Tango Bravo.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.285
Change of location for extra-spicy bucket.
Send to current pin.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.746
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Changing fiesta coordinates.</i>

08:58.829 --> 09:00.957
<i>Jalapeño special</i>
<i>cheesing it to current mark.</i>

09:04.669 --> 09:05.670
There it is.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.968
Frostee, get to work on the devices
while we search for Tony.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.761
Driver, put us on lockdown.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.805
There's a major threat
of attack from Dann.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.015
And I got a major threat
of low blood sugar.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.976
Is there an emergency pizza onboard?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.479
<i>Lab secured.</i>
<i>No ins or outs.</i>

09:24.689 --> 09:27.316
Was that… your voice?

10:52.193 --> 10:55.029
<i>Mobile lab</i>
<i>will self-destruct in ten,</i>

10:55.112 --> 10:56.697
<i>nine, eight…</i>

10:57.198 --> 10:58.699
Everyone, get out!

10:58.783 --> 11:02.995
<i>…five, four, three, two,</i>

11:03.079 --> 11:03.913
<i>one.</i>

11:09.669 --> 11:11.629
-Is everyone okay?

11:11.712 --> 11:14.256
Define "okay."

11:14.340 --> 11:17.760
I think everybody made it out,
but Dann has the devices.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.096
-No way we're catching her now.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.186
Yeah! Take that, cyborg!

11:29.688 --> 11:31.440
Frostee! Grab those devices!

11:34.735 --> 11:35.736
You guys okay?

11:35.820 --> 11:39.323
Yeah, bro, but I can't believe
you called Mitch for help!

11:39.407 --> 11:42.618
It's his city too. We're gonna need
everyone's help this time.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.245
Everyone, get in!

11:44.912 --> 11:47.957
Aw, Jun! You're here?

11:48.040 --> 11:51.127
You think I'd miss a chance
to see a cybernetic super-soldier?

11:51.210 --> 11:54.338
Get Frostee and the devices to safety.
We'll hold off Dann.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.471
Uh-oh.

12:04.598 --> 12:07.560
And that's all for me, I'm done.
Good night, everybody!

12:11.772 --> 12:14.942
I know he's a coward,
but I'm still a little impressed.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.751
Oh, come on, you piece of junk, faster!

12:48.184 --> 12:50.186
Now I know how jelly feels.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.983
Someone slow my roll!

12:56.066 --> 12:58.277
EMP, cyberpunk!

12:59.445 --> 13:01.363
It worked!

13:01.864 --> 13:03.491
Take that, Dann!

13:03.574 --> 13:04.825
Oh, snap.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.173
Nowhere to run, Dann.

13:25.387 --> 13:28.015
You know, I-I've gotta stop
saying things like that.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.977
I will never look at breakfast
the same way again.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.813
Well, Dann got away,
but I think Frostee is safe.

13:34.897 --> 13:35.898
For now.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.401
Yeah, but clearly Dann
has hacked our agency contact.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.779
We can't trust
any communications from now on.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.697
So we can't call for backup.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.242
We're just going to have to
fight Dann outlaw-style.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.744
I vote for not fighting Dann at all.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.330
Agreed. I can't take another donut ride.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.250
I hope Frostee comes up with
some information on the devices.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.670
-Where was Jun taking Frostee, anyway?
-I-I'm not sure.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.339
<i> She gave me</i>
<i>this address out in Malibu.</i>

14:00.422 --> 14:04.218
<i>She told me she thought we could get help</i>
<i>there, but we probably wouldn't like it.</i>

14:16.230 --> 14:17.356
Wait…

14:17.439 --> 14:19.316
Isn't this Shashi's old house?

14:19.900 --> 14:21.318
It sure is.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.029
The house got seized
when Shashi went to prison.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.948
It was auctioned off by the government.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.700
-So who lives here now?

14:29.076 --> 14:30.953
Well, well, well.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.331
Sounds like you all got yourself
in a real pickle!

14:34.415 --> 14:37.001
Good thing old Cleve
is still around to help.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.923
Heck of a storm out there tonight.
Y'all want some hot tea?

14:43.007 --> 14:45.676
Maybe something a little stronger?

14:45.759 --> 14:48.470
How much stronger? You talking cocoa?

14:48.554 --> 14:51.473
Son, I got a raw milk connection
out in Bakersfield,

14:51.557 --> 14:55.060
gets me a gallon a week,
totally unpasteurized.

14:55.144 --> 14:59.189
Then my gal does a hot mix
with a Peruvian marshmallow cream

14:59.273 --> 15:02.902
so fluffy it's outlawed
here in the lower 48.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.196
Ooh, you are bad! I'll take two.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.657
Enough cocoa talk!
Okay? How are you still alive?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.744
Y-You fell off a rocket
in the middle of the Sahara desert!

15:11.827 --> 15:16.123
Yeah, that smarted like heck.
Luckily, that robot suit saved my life.

15:16.206 --> 15:19.126
Then some local villagers
nursed me back to health.

15:19.209 --> 15:22.713
Owe my life to those wonderful people.
Real salt of the earth.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.757
-Aw, that's nice.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.177
Ha! And then I took
their whole goat flock in a dice game

15:28.260 --> 15:30.512
and flipped it for triple the price
a month later!

15:30.596 --> 15:32.264
Oh, that's terrible!

15:32.348 --> 15:36.310
I traveled the world, and ended up
in a Russian fishing village for a bit,

15:36.393 --> 15:38.604
and there I discovered
the most wonderful thing.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.523
The folks there were living
well over a hundred years,

15:41.607 --> 15:45.861
even though they had next to nothing,
just little huts for whole families.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.491
I started to think that maybe
the most important thing in life is just…

15:51.325 --> 15:52.159
love.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.662
Okay, nice again.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.540
And then I realized
it was the oil in their fish guts diet!

15:58.624 --> 16:02.586
So I called an old Russian general,
had him chase them folks off the property,

16:02.670 --> 16:05.172
and I cornered
the fish gut market!

16:05.255 --> 16:08.258
So you are still pretty much
the worst person in the world.

16:08.342 --> 16:12.304
Cat don't change his stripes
on the ninth life, son!

16:13.138 --> 16:17.643
Anyway, I got my crew here working
on social media and gut purification

16:17.726 --> 16:21.563
until I finish my new headquarters
in Hollywood, but the lab's all yours!

16:21.647 --> 16:23.899
I can't believe the agency doesn't know.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.194
Ah, they know. I made some payments
and dropped some names.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.655
After that, the heat on me
died down pretty quick.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.116
Looks like
you're still need-to-know, Echo.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.076
So h-how do we know we can trust you?

16:34.159 --> 16:37.246
You did try to kill us, like, a lot.
Why would you want to help us?

16:37.329 --> 16:41.458
Son, I can't have my new hometown
messed up by some crazy robot.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.210
At least one I don't control.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.913
Wow.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.749
This stuff is strong.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.334
-I can feel cavities forming as I speak.

17:24.418 --> 17:27.087
It tastes like it gives you
super strength for an hour,

17:27.171 --> 17:28.630
then takes a year off your life.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.508
You can't afford to lose a year,
the way you're going.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.968
I'm glad you made it this far.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.679
I can't believe
we're hanging out with Cleve Kelso.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.724
We've had a pretty crazy ride
over the past couple years.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.394
Yeah, but I'm starting to think
this ride is different.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.981
I'm not so sure we're gonna
make it out of this one alive.

17:48.025 --> 17:52.488
Dann is definitely the toughest thing
that we've ever come up against.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.783
But we can take her.
She's all alone. But we…

17:55.866 --> 17:57.743
-Got family.
-Got family.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.411
Yeah, I know.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.455
It's true! You just gotta trust it.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.499
Hey, Tony?

18:03.582 --> 18:06.710
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that
I was working with the agency again.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.504
You would have never done that to me.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.756
No, but that's why you're such a good spy.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.883
Thanks.

18:12.966 --> 18:17.054
But sometimes, I-I feel like
the things that make me a better spy

18:17.137 --> 18:19.348
aren't the things
that make me a better person.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.392
Hey, with our hometown on the line,

18:22.476 --> 18:25.187
there's no one
I'd rather be in a foxhole with.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.400
Tony, listen.
If this is our last night enjoying LA…

18:31.235 --> 18:34.154
It's not. Come on.
Let's go see what Frostee's found out.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.579
Okay, let's get a look
at this thing's guts.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.337
What's that in there? A magnetic core?

18:50.420 --> 18:53.340
This looks like some kind of
resonance-creating device.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.635
Like maybe it sends out a pulse,
then picks up the reverberations?

18:56.718 --> 18:58.929
Is it some kind of underground sonar?

18:59.012 --> 19:03.142
Looks like that cyborg's making a play
to wildcat the Monterey Shale.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.061
-Is that like three-card monte?
-Oh, riskier.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.314
Some folks say there's
15 billion barrels of tight crude

19:09.398 --> 19:12.025
under the surface of Southern California.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.485
Are you talking about oil?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.070
That's what I said.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.073
Course, the problem is,
you might trigger the San Andreas Fault.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.826
Pumping and fracking around here
could cause quakes.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.036
But the payday would be worth it.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.997
For you.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.416
Hey, remember that field trip

19:27.499 --> 19:30.002
to the oldest refinery in the world
up in Santa Clarita?

19:30.085 --> 19:32.421
Yeah! We always
stopped to use the bathroom

19:32.504 --> 19:35.799
at restaurants
that served pea soup and pecan logs.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.177
-I mean, do they not get how that looks?

19:38.260 --> 19:41.638
So what, Dann is
in Los Angeles to drill for oil?

19:42.222 --> 19:44.057
Doesn't seem like her thing.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.644
But with all the oil wells, and the cars,
and the dirtiest air in the country,

19:47.728 --> 19:52.232
if you were an environmental terrorist
cyborg, LA would be a pretty nice target.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.985
But we still don't know
what these devices are for.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.781
I'm gonna run a very low-level test
on the devices

19:59.865 --> 20:02.201
to power them up
and get a reading from them.

20:02.284 --> 20:06.330
Fine, but if we find a gusher here,
it's all mine.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.542
Okay, I'm just going to run
the minimum amount of power through these

20:10.626 --> 20:11.543
to get a readout.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.055
-Nothing's happening.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.728
What are you doing to the second Janeteer?

20:29.811 --> 20:30.812
Second?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.314
-Nothing!

20:32.856 --> 20:35.067
Quiet down, Roscoe.

20:37.819 --> 20:42.115
Oh, no. Powering these up
is making all the devices resonate!

20:43.116 --> 20:45.452
-Shut it down!
-I think it's too late!

20:46.036 --> 20:47.329
We gotta get out of here!

20:55.128 --> 20:56.755
She found us again!

21:01.760 --> 21:05.055
-No time to fight. We gotta run.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.188
-She's gonna get to the devices!
-Let her. Let's go!

21:15.190 --> 21:16.024
Whew!

21:16.108 --> 21:17.150
Whew!

21:38.964 --> 21:40.382
Aw, my fish guts!

21:40.465 --> 21:43.135
That dang cyborg ruined my new business!

21:43.218 --> 21:45.345
Bro, your priorities are whacked.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.597
Any chance that fall took her out?

21:47.681 --> 21:50.058
After what she did at the North Pole?

21:50.600 --> 21:51.601
I don't think so.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.688
Also, it looks like Dann has
a giant earthquake machine

21:54.771 --> 21:56.732
she's gonna use to destroy LA.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.400
Worse. Look.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.738
This line runs through
highly combustible oil and gas beds.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.615
If Dann triggers her quakes
down this line…

22:06.116 --> 22:11.246
All of Southern California is going to
slide into the sea or burn to the ground.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.275
