04:11.544 --> 04:13.796
Boxers!

04:59.634 --> 05:02.220
Not one step further.

05:02.303 --> 05:05.682
The keeper
of the lmperial Seal.

05:05.765 --> 05:08.268
Just the man l was looking for.

05:10.979 --> 05:12.522
A woman.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.941
You Chinese are
very progressive.

05:51.561 --> 05:53.521
A gift from an old friend.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.316
Wu Chow.

05:57.192 --> 05:59.861
He wanted me to send
his regards.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.700
Father!

07:00.171 --> 07:01.798
Father.

07:01.881 --> 07:06.261
The seal.
You must get it back.

07:08.179 --> 07:09.681
l promise.

07:09.764 --> 07:14.561
Give this... to your brother.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.217
What are you reading?

07:47.260 --> 07:50.930
Oh.
"Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy."

07:51.014 --> 07:52.265
lt's incredible.

07:52.307 --> 07:54.434
Roy's just taken out
the Mummy's entire army

07:54.475 --> 07:58.021
of zombie confederate soldiers,
and he only had one bullet.

07:58.104 --> 07:59.772
That's impossible.

07:59.814 --> 08:01.107
Oh, no, it's not.

08:01.149 --> 08:03.818
Roy figured out
the physics of the canyon

08:03.902 --> 08:06.362
and then ricocheted a bullet
off the canyon wall.

08:06.446 --> 08:08.448
Nailed each zombie
through the heart.

08:09.157 --> 08:10.783
What about the Shanghai Kid?

08:10.867 --> 08:12.619
He was captured
and knocked out on page 10

08:12.660 --> 08:14.329
while he was polishing
Roy's pearl handles.

08:14.412 --> 08:15.496
Don't you worry.

08:15.580 --> 08:18.625
Roy's about to save him from
becoming a human sacrifice.

08:18.708 --> 08:21.503
Those stories are all lies.

08:21.586 --> 08:22.629
No. See?

08:22.712 --> 08:23.963
lt says right here
on the back.

08:24.047 --> 08:27.217
"Author Sage McCallister bases
all his stories

08:27.300 --> 08:29.135
on firsthand accounts."

08:51.115 --> 08:53.535
Sorry, sheriff.
No princess.

08:58.081 --> 08:59.791
Every day you meet
the noon stage.

08:59.874 --> 09:02.335
Every day it's the same story.

09:02.377 --> 09:04.170
She's not coming back.

09:04.212 --> 09:07.423
Pei Pei's married to her work
in San Francisco.

09:07.507 --> 09:08.925
Modern woman.

09:09.008 --> 09:11.261
Sheriff, you got a parcel.

09:12.637 --> 09:14.514
Hey, maybe it's from her!

09:14.514 --> 09:17.058
No. lt's from my sister
in China.

10:07.358 --> 10:08.818
l know.

10:13.198 --> 10:15.533
l know.
l must go.

10:15.617 --> 10:18.995
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

10:23.833 --> 10:27.587
Uh, sheriff,
that stage is headed east.

10:27.629 --> 10:30.340
lsn't China kind of west
of here?

10:30.381 --> 10:33.092
l'm not going to China.
l'm going to New York.

10:33.176 --> 10:34.636
Roy invested my money.

10:35.136 --> 10:38.306
ls it true that he lives in a
penthouse at the top of the Ritz

10:38.515 --> 10:40.016
surrounded by dozens
of beautiful women

10:40.141 --> 10:41.768
at his every beck and call?

10:41.809 --> 10:43.269
That's the old Roy.

10:43.353 --> 10:45.647
He's married, settled down.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.483
Trust me, he's changed.

10:50.026 --> 10:52.654
So there we were.
Completely outnumbered.

10:52.737 --> 10:55.490
He didn't have to tell me
we didn't stand a chance.

10:55.532 --> 10:58.785
So l send the Shanghai Kid
and the princess out the back.

10:58.910 --> 11:01.454
Poor Shanghai Kid.
He was so frightened.

11:01.538 --> 11:03.831
He forgot to thank me
for saving his life.

11:04.666 --> 11:05.667
l'm used to that.

11:05.750 --> 11:09.629
Now, l returned to the front,
and l counted to three...

11:09.712 --> 11:11.840
and l burst out of the mission.

11:11.923 --> 11:15.844
Pearl handles blazing.
Lead flying everywhere.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.887
And not a single bullet
touched me.

11:18.596 --> 11:20.306
-No!
-Yeah.

11:20.348 --> 11:22.517
What happened
to the emperor's gold?

11:22.600 --> 11:23.852
Well, we divided it up.

11:23.935 --> 11:27.021
l insisted on giving my share
to the lndians.

11:27.105 --> 11:29.274
The savages?

11:29.357 --> 11:33.027
Please don't ever call
those noble people savages.

11:33.111 --> 11:34.320
lf being proud of your body

11:34.404 --> 11:36.865
and wanting to ride around naked
all day makes you a savage,

11:36.906 --> 11:39.868
then, by God,
you're drinking with a savage.

11:54.257 --> 11:56.634
And that is what you call
a French toast.

11:56.718 --> 12:00.346
You are so sophisticated,
Mr. O'Bannon.

12:01.389 --> 12:02.348
Whoo!

12:02.432 --> 12:05.643
Who's up for some more bubbly?

12:17.405 --> 12:19.657
Reach for the sky, Roy.

12:20.575 --> 12:21.868
Say that again.

12:21.951 --> 12:24.120
Reach for the sky, Roy.

12:24.204 --> 12:26.748
Chon Wang!

12:26.831 --> 12:28.625
You sly son of a gun!

12:28.708 --> 12:30.668
-Look at you!
-Look at you!

12:30.752 --> 12:33.838
-What brings you to New York?
-My share of the gold.

12:33.922 --> 12:36.216
Refresh my memory.
What gold?

12:36.257 --> 12:38.384
The emperor's gold.

12:38.468 --> 12:41.012
Okay, now, that gold is in

12:41.095 --> 12:43.890
what the Wall Street pros call
a long-term investment.

12:43.932 --> 12:45.892
We can't touch it
because it's building.

12:45.934 --> 12:46.935
l need it tonight.

12:47.018 --> 12:48.937
You just got here.
Let's celebrate.

12:49.020 --> 12:49.938
No. l don't have time.

12:50.021 --> 12:53.399
-You just got to the big city.
-My father's been killed.

12:57.612 --> 12:58.947
Chon, l'm...

12:59.030 --> 13:00.949
You need the money to get back
for the funeral?

13:01.032 --> 13:04.285
No. l must go to England.
The ship leaves tonight.

13:04.369 --> 13:05.870
Your father died in England?

13:05.954 --> 13:08.665
China. My sister followed
the murderer to London.

13:08.748 --> 13:12.293
Wait. Murderer.
l'm a little bit mixed up.

13:12.377 --> 13:14.379
Let me see if l can get
the facts straight.

13:14.462 --> 13:17.549
You have a sister? You never
told me you had a sister.

13:17.632 --> 13:19.968
ls she pretty or does she look
like you? Be honest.

13:20.051 --> 13:22.387
Roy, l need my money!

13:22.428 --> 13:24.389
l don't like
that tone of voice.

13:24.472 --> 13:27.517
You think after all we've been
through l'd stiff you?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.686
l'm doing pretty well
for myself.

13:29.769 --> 13:31.354
Yeah.

13:31.938 --> 13:34.399
-l'm sorry, Roy.
-That's okay.

13:34.482 --> 13:36.484
You're going through
a really tough time right now.

13:36.568 --> 13:38.778
You got to be more trusting
of people, okay?

13:38.820 --> 13:40.572
Look at me.
lt's Roy.

13:40.655 --> 13:42.782
The couple at table 5
is ready to order.

13:46.619 --> 13:48.162
Do you work here?

13:48.246 --> 13:49.497
No, l don't work here.

13:49.581 --> 13:52.000
lt looks like these guys
are wearing a similar jacket.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.544
Roy, here's your cut
of the tips.

13:59.674 --> 14:00.925
lt's the craziest thing.

14:00.967 --> 14:03.636
l guess because
l come in here so much

14:03.720 --> 14:05.138
they're mistaking me
for a waiter.

14:05.221 --> 14:07.849
-lt's embarrassing.
-You lost the gold.

14:09.267 --> 14:11.269
-Not all of it.
-Where's the rest?

14:11.352 --> 14:15.231
l have one word for you.
Zeppelin.

14:15.315 --> 14:17.025
l need my money now!

14:17.108 --> 14:18.902
-Easy, easy.

14:20.695 --> 14:22.197
Will you do anything
for this money?

14:22.280 --> 14:24.157
Yes.
l must leave tonight.

14:24.199 --> 14:25.992
Okay.
Take this key.

14:26.075 --> 14:27.994
Go to the room.
Get cleaned up.

14:28.036 --> 14:29.621
Your old pal Roy's got a plan.

14:29.704 --> 14:31.831
Go! Come on!

14:47.388 --> 14:50.558
Howdy, big boy.

15:01.027 --> 15:01.945
What?

15:02.028 --> 15:04.697
There's a woman in there!
She wants me to sleep with her.

15:04.781 --> 15:05.865
Of course she does.

15:05.907 --> 15:08.117
l told her the Great Wall
ain't the only big thing

15:08.201 --> 15:09.160
coming out of China.

15:09.244 --> 15:11.788
-Why did you say that?
-So you could get the money.

15:11.871 --> 15:13.957
l will not sleep with women
for money!

15:14.040 --> 15:14.958
Why?

15:15.041 --> 15:17.168
l'm gonna sleep with her
for money.

15:17.794 --> 15:20.547
Chon, just go in there
and do your business

15:20.588 --> 15:22.715
and think about your sister
in England.

15:22.757 --> 15:24.217
-What?
-Roy!

15:24.259 --> 15:26.094
-Duty calls.
-Roy!

15:31.766 --> 15:33.643
Good evening, Mr. Mayor.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.061
Where are they?

15:35.103 --> 15:36.271
Who?

15:37.605 --> 15:39.065
My daughters.

15:39.107 --> 15:40.233
10th floor.

15:47.323 --> 15:49.784
Roy?
Roy, you got trouble.

15:49.826 --> 15:51.411
Roy!

15:51.494 --> 15:54.038
l got to check on something.
l'll be right back.

15:56.457 --> 15:58.084
Chon, new plan.
We got to go.

15:58.168 --> 15:59.919
-Chon, what are you doing?!

15:59.919 --> 16:01.254
l'm fixing her back.

16:01.296 --> 16:03.798
Put her down,
you decadent Philistine.

16:06.217 --> 16:08.219
Hey, Chon, come on!
Let's go!

16:09.470 --> 16:10.513
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

16:10.597 --> 16:12.432
Come on!

16:14.017 --> 16:16.269
l don't understand.
What's going on?

16:16.311 --> 16:17.604
l don't have time to explain.

16:17.645 --> 16:20.148
All you have to know is there
are bad men after us...

16:20.231 --> 16:21.608
but l'm in the right.

16:21.691 --> 16:26.154
-Roy.
-You gotta trust me on this.

16:26.196 --> 16:27.280
Okay, look.

16:27.363 --> 16:30.283
l'm in a transitional phase
in my life.

16:30.325 --> 16:31.826
-But...
-But what?

16:33.369 --> 16:35.288
You want to know the truth?

16:35.371 --> 16:37.373
l'm a little lost right now.

16:37.457 --> 16:39.459
l see you.
You've got a sense of purpose.

16:39.542 --> 16:43.338
But look at me.
l'm a 30-year-old waiter/gigolo.

16:43.379 --> 16:45.715
Where's the future in that?

16:50.178 --> 16:52.263
So what's the plan?

16:52.347 --> 16:54.182
You were always
my compass, Chon.

16:54.265 --> 16:56.518
The plan.
You ask me the right questions.

16:56.601 --> 16:57.560
The plan?

16:57.644 --> 17:00.355
The plan, l think,
is to find the right woman.

17:00.438 --> 17:02.857
Raise a lot of children
and teach them values.

17:02.941 --> 17:05.693
No, Roy.
The plan to get out of here.

17:05.777 --> 17:07.529
Okay, the plan.
Here we go.

17:18.957 --> 17:20.583
-Cops! Cops!
-They can help us.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.961
No, no.
Chon, not these cops.

17:23.044 --> 17:26.005
These are dirty cops.
They take advantage of people.

17:26.047 --> 17:30.510
Now, if they stop us, remember,
l'm not Roy O'Bannon.

17:30.593 --> 17:32.053
Who are you?

17:32.095 --> 17:35.390
l'm your friend Smoky Desperado
from the West.

17:35.473 --> 17:36.724
And who am l?

17:36.808 --> 17:38.852
You. You're Benihana.

17:38.935 --> 17:41.062
-Benihana.
-Yeah.

17:41.145 --> 17:44.649
You teach crippled children yoga
here in the city.

17:44.732 --> 17:47.735
-You go first.
-No! Why me?

17:47.819 --> 17:50.196
Because you blend in, okay?

17:50.321 --> 17:53.241
Now, go!
Don't let them see you!

17:54.993 --> 17:56.077
Benihana.

18:12.552 --> 18:14.262
Hey! Hey!

19:17.116 --> 19:19.786
Chon!

19:19.827 --> 19:21.371
Come on.
Stop wasting time.

19:26.042 --> 19:26.918
You!

19:27.043 --> 19:29.254
Chon, l found our ticket
out of here.

19:30.797 --> 19:32.131
We're on our way.

19:32.257 --> 19:34.384
Looks like old Roy
came through again.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.427
Just like old times, Chon.

19:36.511 --> 19:38.263
Check over there!

19:38.346 --> 19:41.391
-Over to the alley!
-That way!

19:44.602 --> 19:47.480
Yeah, just like old times.

19:47.564 --> 19:49.315
Will you forget about the gold
for a second?

19:49.315 --> 19:51.109
You're gonna have more money
than you ever dreamed of

19:51.150 --> 19:52.944
when that first zeppelin
takes off.

19:52.986 --> 19:56.114
Why do l always believe you?

19:56.197 --> 19:57.991
What do you mean?

19:58.032 --> 19:59.576
You're lucky l didn't invest

19:59.659 --> 20:02.620
in that ridiculous
automobile idea.

20:02.704 --> 20:04.539
Yeah, that's gonna make
a lot of money.

20:29.564 --> 20:30.940
What's that?

20:31.024 --> 20:33.568
Doghouse.
l'm in the doghouse.

20:34.485 --> 20:36.237
Oh, come on, Chon.

20:36.321 --> 20:38.281
Look, l'm sorry l lied.

20:38.323 --> 20:40.867
l just didn't want to
disappoint you.

20:42.202 --> 20:44.245
That's exactly what l mean.

20:44.329 --> 20:45.872
l can't take that look.

20:45.997 --> 20:48.666
l learned it from my father.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.835
That's how he used to look
at me.

20:52.086 --> 20:54.714
What did your dad do?
Was he an lmperial Guard?

20:54.756 --> 20:55.798
No.

20:55.924 --> 20:58.760
Much more important.

20:58.885 --> 21:01.346
He was the keeper
of the lmperial Seal.

21:01.387 --> 21:02.847
That's what l love
about China.

21:02.931 --> 21:05.767
Everybody's job description
sounds so damn cool.

21:05.808 --> 21:08.811
The seal has been symbol
of the emperor's power

21:08.937 --> 21:10.104
since Genghis Khan.

21:10.146 --> 21:13.483
lt has been passed down
from one emperor to another.

21:13.525 --> 21:17.070
My family have been watching
over it for 12 generations.

21:17.153 --> 21:18.738
12 generations?

21:20.114 --> 21:22.867
My father and l used to
skip stones across the moat

21:22.909 --> 21:27.163
and talk about a day
l would follow his footsteps.

21:28.706 --> 21:31.626
l was his only son.

21:31.709 --> 21:35.296
lf l'd have been there,
l could have protected him.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.757
lt's not your fault.
You were 3,000 miles away.

21:41.094 --> 21:42.804
What's with that little box?

21:43.763 --> 21:47.642
My sister sent it to me
from my father.

21:47.684 --> 21:50.478
-There's a message inside.
-What's it say?

21:50.520 --> 21:53.273
lt's a puzzle box.
l don't know how to open yet.

21:53.314 --> 21:54.274
What do you mean?

21:54.315 --> 21:56.901
Get a hammer and smash it open
so you can see what it says.

21:56.985 --> 21:59.153
l must have patience.

21:59.279 --> 22:01.614
By the time
l'm able to open it...

22:01.656 --> 22:03.032
l will be ready to read
the message.

22:03.157 --> 22:04.325
Come on, Confucius.

22:04.367 --> 22:06.619
That's the corniest thing
l've ever heard.

22:09.706 --> 22:11.541
Let me see this.

22:14.586 --> 22:16.087
You know what?

22:16.171 --> 22:18.131
We're gonna go to England.

22:18.173 --> 22:19.674
We're gonna find
your dad's killer.

22:19.716 --> 22:21.217
We're gonna get
that seal back.

22:21.301 --> 22:22.760
There's no reward
for this, Roy.

22:22.844 --> 22:24.095
Who said anything
about a reward?

22:24.179 --> 22:27.640
l'm talking about friendship,
loyalty, honor.

22:27.724 --> 22:29.225
Okay?

22:30.143 --> 22:31.686
Thank you, Roy.

22:34.439 --> 22:36.482
And l hear England is ass soup.

22:36.566 --> 22:38.776
A lot of pretty girls there.

22:50.955 --> 22:53.666
First order of business,
my Lords...

22:53.708 --> 22:57.504
is a report from our esteemed
friend Lord Rathbone...

22:57.587 --> 23:02.550
who recently returned from
a diplomatic mission to China.

23:13.394 --> 23:15.438
Fellow Lords...

23:15.522 --> 23:19.359
l'm afraid l bring disturbing
news from the Orient.

23:20.068 --> 23:22.195
The opium wars
have ravaged the land.

23:22.278 --> 23:24.697
The emperor's enemies
are organizing.

23:24.739 --> 23:27.367
The most vicious
are the Boxers.

23:27.408 --> 23:31.412
A godless band of rebels
who murder without discretion.

23:32.914 --> 23:35.208
China is not well.

23:36.876 --> 23:40.922
l have brought back an envoy
who should give us some insight

23:41.005 --> 23:44.551
into the inscrutable mind
of the Chinese.

23:48.096 --> 23:50.473
ls he mad?

23:50.557 --> 23:53.476
Given to Her Majesty
Queen Victoria by the emperor

23:53.560 --> 23:57.397
in recognition of her
50 glorious years on the throne.

23:59.190 --> 24:00.859
Outrageousness!

24:02.235 --> 24:03.945
Long live the queen.

24:27.260 --> 24:29.637
Jack the Ripper
strikes again!

24:29.679 --> 24:32.432
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.

24:32.473 --> 24:34.142
Howdy, partner.

24:35.101 --> 24:37.228
The English are not
very friendly.

24:37.270 --> 24:39.772
They're just sore losers.

24:39.856 --> 24:41.316
What did they lose?

24:41.399 --> 24:44.819
A little thing called
the American Revolution, Chon.

24:44.903 --> 24:45.862
Never heard of it.

24:45.945 --> 24:47.280
l'll give you the highlights.

24:47.363 --> 24:49.282
They came over
with about a million men.

24:49.324 --> 24:51.326
We had a bunch of farmers
with pitchforks

24:51.367 --> 24:53.453
and beat 'em like a drum.

24:56.915 --> 24:58.750
Hey! l'm walking here!

24:58.833 --> 25:02.170
You're driving on the wrong side
of the road!

25:02.253 --> 25:05.965
Bunch of amateurs.
These people don't get it.

25:06.007 --> 25:07.800
Hello, ladies.

25:11.554 --> 25:12.639
Look at you.

25:12.722 --> 25:14.974
What? l'm not supposed to
notice a pretty lady?

25:15.058 --> 25:17.519
l thought you wanted to
settle down and have a family.

25:17.602 --> 25:20.897
l do, Chon.
l just hope l can.

25:20.980 --> 25:22.023
Why not?

25:22.106 --> 25:25.693
Sometimes l worry that
all the damn horseback riding

25:25.777 --> 25:27.070
l did out in the West,

25:27.153 --> 25:31.157
bouncing up and down on the
hard saddles might have made it

25:31.199 --> 25:35.578
so my salmon don't swim upstream
the way they're supposed to.

25:35.662 --> 25:36.704
What?

25:36.788 --> 25:39.958
l might be shooting blanks.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.042
Oh.

25:41.125 --> 25:43.253
Don't say anything.

25:44.420 --> 25:47.340
Roy, it's okay.

25:47.423 --> 25:49.968
Some people are not meant
to have a family.

25:50.051 --> 25:52.887
l've always had such a special
connection with children.

25:52.929 --> 25:54.222
The little ankle biters.

25:54.305 --> 25:56.391
Hey, watch it,
you little punk!

25:56.474 --> 25:58.309
Pardon me, guv.

26:02.146 --> 26:04.065
You gents lost your way?

26:04.148 --> 26:06.609
Yeah. We're looking
for my sister.

26:06.693 --> 26:09.445
She's staying
at 32 Oxford Street.

26:09.529 --> 26:12.657
l know it well, guv.
Me old man used to live there.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.743
Can you show us the way?

26:15.827 --> 26:19.831
Well, memory's
a little dodgy.

26:19.914 --> 26:22.333
But l'm sure for a bob
l could get you there.

26:22.417 --> 26:25.128
What do you take us for?
Okies from Muskogee?

26:25.211 --> 26:27.255
Go sell your bullshit
someplace else.

26:27.338 --> 26:29.299
We're not buying.

26:29.382 --> 26:31.009
Thanks for the tip, guv.

26:31.092 --> 26:33.386
Hey! l stole that watch
from my uncle!

26:33.428 --> 26:34.721
What?

26:55.033 --> 26:56.075
This way.

27:00.079 --> 27:02.248
Come here,
you little rubbish eater!

27:02.332 --> 27:05.460
What did l tell you about
poaching on our turf, Charlie?

27:05.543 --> 27:07.670
l'm on the straight
and narrow. Honest.

27:12.634 --> 27:15.011
What's this, then?

27:15.094 --> 27:16.471
After l'm through
beating you...

27:16.554 --> 27:19.474
you're gonna wish you never
ran away from the workhouse!

27:19.557 --> 27:21.142
Leave the boy alone.

27:22.143 --> 27:25.104
Bloody tourists!
Get your noses out of it!

27:25.146 --> 27:26.940
Do whatever you want
to the kid...

27:27.023 --> 27:28.733
but that's my watch.

27:28.816 --> 27:33.238
Well, there's a load of us
and only two of you.

27:33.321 --> 27:35.114
So piss off!

27:35.198 --> 27:37.450
Easy, fellas.
You've lost one war this way.

27:37.534 --> 27:39.452
Don't make
the same mistake twice.

27:55.468 --> 27:57.470
Come on!
After him!

28:03.852 --> 28:05.019
Hey!

28:10.483 --> 28:11.818
There he is!
Get him!

28:11.860 --> 28:14.487
We've got him now.
Move in, lads.

28:37.886 --> 28:40.763
Boys, boys, wait, wait!

28:50.106 --> 28:51.482
Come on! Get him!

28:51.566 --> 28:52.567
Up the bloody ladder!

29:23.848 --> 29:26.601
Hey! Hey!

29:27.435 --> 29:29.020
Watch it!

29:36.319 --> 29:37.403
Hey.

30:04.138 --> 30:05.557
Come here, you!

30:37.547 --> 30:38.715
Cool.

30:58.526 --> 30:59.736
Move it!

31:38.983 --> 31:40.193
You!

31:52.747 --> 31:55.083
Did you see that?

31:55.166 --> 31:56.793
lt's okay.

31:56.918 --> 31:57.961
Okay?!

31:58.002 --> 31:59.712
l call that one
my kung pao chicken.

31:59.754 --> 32:01.506
l clotheslined the sucker.

32:03.550 --> 32:04.676
Come on, get back!

32:04.717 --> 32:06.970
Clear away!

32:07.053 --> 32:08.763
Make way!

32:20.608 --> 32:24.904
l think you gentlemen should
accompany me back to the yard.

32:24.946 --> 32:27.574
This isn't a yard!
lt's a jail!

32:27.615 --> 32:28.950
Roy, calm down.

32:30.910 --> 32:33.538
Unbelievable.

32:35.290 --> 32:36.583
Wait!
Someone's coming!

32:36.666 --> 32:38.710
-Let me handle this.
-l'm gonna handle it.

32:38.793 --> 32:40.295
The English aren't like you.

32:40.336 --> 32:42.547
They don't get all emotional.
Touchy-feely.

32:42.589 --> 32:43.715
Do me a favor.

32:43.798 --> 32:46.259
Park the kung fu.
Let me do the talking.

32:47.552 --> 32:51.347
Come here.
Let me give you a hug.

32:53.933 --> 32:57.437
l've been after that
Fleet Street gang for two years.

32:57.478 --> 32:59.439
Then you two come along
and bring them down

32:59.522 --> 33:01.399
in a single afternoon.
Brilliant!

33:01.482 --> 33:03.067
Now, um...

33:03.151 --> 33:04.485
Oh, that's my watch!

33:04.569 --> 33:06.237
Yes. A street urchin
turned it in.

33:06.321 --> 33:08.406
The little punk better not
have scuffed it.

33:08.448 --> 33:11.492
-l hope your luck picks up.
-What do you mean?

33:11.576 --> 33:14.579
l deduced from your watch
that you'd hit a rough patch.

33:14.662 --> 33:16.331
He has.
How do you know?

33:16.414 --> 33:18.958
lt's an investigative technique
l've developed.

33:19.042 --> 33:22.295
l can deduce intimate details
about an individual

33:22.378 --> 33:25.882
through a close scrutiny
of their personal effects.

33:25.965 --> 33:27.800
What else can you tell?

33:29.552 --> 33:33.723
The owner of this watch
is a bad gambler

33:33.806 --> 33:35.225
and a lousy shot.

33:35.308 --> 33:37.977
Although he's cheated death
several times...

33:38.061 --> 33:41.606
he spends most of his life
wandering in a rather pathetic

33:41.648 --> 33:44.526
and futile search
for purpose and respect.

33:45.360 --> 33:46.736
Oh, yes.

33:46.819 --> 33:49.781
He has a penchant
for loose women.

33:51.199 --> 33:53.701
Wow. That's amazing.

33:53.785 --> 33:55.787
l'm sure it's a very popular
party trick

33:55.828 --> 33:57.664
at birthdays
for small children...

33:57.747 --> 34:00.667
but it doesn't quite play
with adults.

34:00.708 --> 34:02.210
Just to set
the record straight.

34:02.293 --> 34:04.963
Roy O'Bannon is not attracted
to loose women.

34:05.046 --> 34:06.756
Loose women
are attracted to me.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.967
-You're Roy O'Bannon?
-Yeah.

34:09.007 --> 34:11.010
The famous Western folk hero?

34:11.052 --> 34:12.219
Have you heard of me?

34:12.303 --> 34:13.638
Have l heard of you?

34:13.679 --> 34:17.058
l've only read "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy" five times.

34:17.141 --> 34:18.351
lt's fascinating.

34:18.434 --> 34:20.186
l want you to meet
the Shanghai Kid.

34:20.228 --> 34:21.271
Oh, yes.

34:21.353 --> 34:23.940
The faithful Chinese sidekick.

34:24.023 --> 34:27.527
l'm not a sidekick.
Those stories are all lies.

34:27.610 --> 34:29.529
Come on, don't be bitter.

34:29.571 --> 34:32.072
l can't help what
Sage McCallister writes.

34:32.156 --> 34:35.909
lf there's anything l can do,
l'm at your service.

34:35.994 --> 34:38.955
We're looking for my sister.
She's staying at this address.

34:39.038 --> 34:41.958
Can you take us there?

34:42.041 --> 34:43.960
Oh, dear.

34:44.043 --> 34:46.504
l think you'd better come
with me.

35:12.906 --> 35:14.407
Lin.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.993
Wang.

35:22.749 --> 35:26.753
lf you don't mind,
l'll just wait outside.

35:28.671 --> 35:30.632
lntroduce me.

35:30.715 --> 35:33.843
Oh. This is Lin,
my baby sister.

35:36.179 --> 35:38.264
Roy O'Bannon.

35:39.724 --> 35:41.059
Pleasure.

35:41.935 --> 35:44.521
You never told me your sister
was such a...

35:44.562 --> 35:46.606
beautiful lotus blossom.

35:53.446 --> 35:54.113
What'd she say?

35:55.657 --> 35:56.449
No, no, no.

35:56.533 --> 35:58.618
No talking about me
in your native tongue.

35:59.619 --> 36:01.037
Why are you in jail?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.956
l followed the man
who murdered Father.

36:02.997 --> 36:04.249
And?

36:04.290 --> 36:05.834
l found out where he live.

36:05.917 --> 36:08.795
l snuck inside his house
and tried to kill him.

36:08.837 --> 36:10.880
lt's my duty to find
Father's killer.

36:10.964 --> 36:13.633
No, it is mine!
l'm the one who promised Father.

36:13.675 --> 36:15.051
But l'm his only son.

36:15.134 --> 36:17.428
When you abandoned us
for America...

36:17.554 --> 36:19.222
Father said he had no son.

36:19.305 --> 36:20.682
What?

36:22.642 --> 36:24.519
Whoa. Time out.

36:24.602 --> 36:26.229
Time out. Come here.

36:26.271 --> 36:27.814
The detective's a fan.

36:27.856 --> 36:29.774
Why don't l play
the celebrity card?

36:29.858 --> 36:31.442
We'll get her out that way.

36:31.568 --> 36:33.820
-Okay?
-Okay.

36:36.990 --> 36:39.617
Don't worry.
l'll get you out.

36:44.497 --> 36:45.999
Everything's gonna be okay.

36:46.040 --> 36:49.335
ln fact, l'm gonna give you
my good-luck playing cards.

36:51.171 --> 36:53.548
Just ignore the naked ladies.

36:54.257 --> 36:55.300
Wang!

36:56.134 --> 36:59.262
Have you opened Father's box?

36:59.387 --> 37:00.972
Not yet.

37:08.062 --> 37:10.607
She tried to assassinate
Lord Rathbone

37:10.732 --> 37:13.151
whilst he was taking
afternoon tea.

37:13.193 --> 37:15.278
He's 10th in line
to the throne...

37:15.403 --> 37:17.322
Her Majesty's
favorite cousin...

37:17.363 --> 37:19.574
and the finest swordsman
in England.

37:22.493 --> 37:24.621
So, of course,
the press had a field day.

37:24.746 --> 37:27.874
The story actually knocked Jack
the Ripper off the front page.

37:27.957 --> 37:29.751
Artie, Lin is not a killer.

37:29.834 --> 37:32.670
She's just a really,
really, really hot...

37:32.754 --> 37:34.589
confused Chinese girl.

37:34.714 --> 37:37.967
Maybe if l agreed to sign
a few autographs

37:38.051 --> 37:40.094
and talk to some of my fans
here in England...

37:40.178 --> 37:43.681
do some type of charity event,
can we get her out that way?

37:43.765 --> 37:45.725
l'm afraid
that's out of the question.

37:45.767 --> 37:47.227
What will happen
to my sister?

37:47.268 --> 37:50.021
She'll go to trial,
probably be locked away

37:50.104 --> 37:52.815
in an institution
for the criminally insane.

37:52.941 --> 37:55.652
The tabloids have already
dubbed her "Loony Lin."

37:55.735 --> 37:57.737
l thought it was rather catchy.

37:59.489 --> 38:01.533
At the time.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.426
Do you have any notion
what would happen

38:20.426 --> 38:21.845
if we were to be seen
together?

38:21.928 --> 38:25.765
Since your return, l have yet to
lay eyes on the lmperial Seal.

38:25.807 --> 38:29.102
l'm hosting a jubilee ball
at my country estate tomorrow.

38:29.143 --> 38:31.521
Be at the stables
at midnight.

38:32.146 --> 38:35.775
As requested,
a token of my esteem.

38:43.074 --> 38:45.451
This is where you get out.

38:48.246 --> 38:50.248
l hope there will be
more trust between us

38:50.331 --> 38:53.418
when l'm emperor
and you are the new king.

39:01.968 --> 39:04.971
Wow. Buckingham Palace.
Look at that, Chon.

39:05.054 --> 39:07.223
That's where the queen lives.

39:08.308 --> 39:10.476
Hey, look at this guy.

39:10.476 --> 39:13.313
He's a royal guard.
He has a very important job.

39:13.354 --> 39:14.606
l used to be just like him.

39:14.647 --> 39:16.316
No, they're nothing like you.

39:16.357 --> 39:17.984
They're a tourist attraction.

39:18.026 --> 39:20.028
You can make faces at them,
insult them...

39:20.111 --> 39:21.362
and they can't move a muscle.

39:21.404 --> 39:22.947
-Here. Watch this.
-Roy...

39:22.989 --> 39:24.324
No, it's okay.

39:24.365 --> 39:26.868
Hey, buddy,
your shoes are untied.

39:29.871 --> 39:33.708
That is the biggest damn beaver
l have ever seen.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.793
Roy, stop it.

39:35.877 --> 39:36.794
The queen!

39:36.878 --> 39:37.837
Look! The queen!

39:37.879 --> 39:40.632
She's mooning us!

39:40.715 --> 39:42.258
He almost went for that.

39:42.383 --> 39:44.594
My friend and l just came over
from America.

39:44.677 --> 39:47.347
You might have heard of it.
We run your jerkwater country.

39:47.430 --> 39:50.600
Come on, you gonna take that
from a colonial?

39:50.642 --> 39:51.684
Roy, stop it.

39:51.809 --> 39:54.896
l bet you are one hell
of a damn poker player.

39:54.979 --> 39:56.147
No hard feelings.

40:01.027 --> 40:02.612
They can't do that!

40:02.654 --> 40:04.030
You're not allowed to do that!

40:04.072 --> 40:05.156
Shouldn't have touched him.

40:05.198 --> 40:07.242
You scram, you little punk.

40:07.283 --> 40:08.868
l've got friends
at Scotland Yard.

40:08.868 --> 40:10.370
l'll give you up
in a heartbeat.

40:10.411 --> 40:11.913
You get your watch back?

40:11.996 --> 40:14.415
Don't worry about my watch.
Go on.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.625
lt's a knockoff.

40:15.667 --> 40:17.168
What are you talking about?

40:17.210 --> 40:20.004
My uncle stole this watch
from President Lincoln.

40:20.088 --> 40:22.048
lt's a priceless
family heirloom.

40:22.090 --> 40:24.133
Not according
to the pawnbroker.

40:24.217 --> 40:25.552
You should not steal.

40:25.677 --> 40:27.887
lf l don't steal,
l don't eat.

40:27.929 --> 40:31.975
Who showed you how to do
all that kicking and punching?

40:32.058 --> 40:33.893
My father.

40:33.893 --> 40:37.021
Have you ever heard of those?
They're parents.

40:37.063 --> 40:38.898
You don't 'cause you're
a little orphan.

40:38.982 --> 40:42.527
Now, go on.
You're cramping our style.

40:44.821 --> 40:47.073
Oh, this country blows.

40:47.115 --> 40:50.201
You need a place to stay?

40:53.872 --> 40:55.790
Come on in
and warm your dogs.

40:55.832 --> 40:58.668
You can
get into a lot of trouble

40:58.793 --> 41:00.587
breaking into
a place like this.

41:00.628 --> 41:02.380
That being said, well done.

41:07.635 --> 41:09.554
You just ate
the last chocolate.

41:09.637 --> 41:10.763
Course l did.

41:10.805 --> 41:12.849
You gotta look out
for number one.

41:13.933 --> 41:15.560
l could really
get used to this.

41:15.602 --> 41:18.021
Living the life
of a country gentleman.

41:18.104 --> 41:19.981
Maybe doing
a little painting.

41:20.064 --> 41:22.859
Let Lin play in the garden
with the children.

41:22.901 --> 41:25.361
Vera, Chuck, and Dave.

41:25.445 --> 41:26.863
Who's Lin?

41:26.946 --> 41:30.575
Lin's the most beautiful woman
l've ever met.

41:30.658 --> 41:33.828
She's gonna be the savior
of the house of O'Bannon.

41:33.870 --> 41:36.706
Chon, check out the threads.

41:36.789 --> 41:39.626
All l'm missing is the
loyal hound curled at my feet.

41:39.751 --> 41:42.170
We are wasting time.
We must find Rathbone.

41:42.212 --> 41:43.546
What do you think
l've been doing?

41:43.630 --> 41:45.590
Sitting here drinking
expensive hooch?

41:45.673 --> 41:46.674
Refill.

41:46.758 --> 41:49.010
l've been working on a plan.

41:49.135 --> 41:53.348
Now -- Whoa.
Don't slosh the brandy.

41:53.431 --> 41:55.767
-lt messes with the bouquet.
-Sod off.

41:55.850 --> 41:57.810
l'm trying to teach you
a skill set.

41:57.977 --> 41:59.437
Help get you off the street.

41:59.521 --> 42:01.481
-Bartenders make big bucks.
-Roy!

42:01.606 --> 42:03.316
The plan.

42:03.358 --> 42:05.109
Thank you, Chon.

42:05.151 --> 42:07.320
lf we find the seal...

42:07.403 --> 42:10.448
we can prove Rathbone
killed your dad.

42:12.659 --> 42:15.328
lt's the old Hail Mary play.

42:15.370 --> 42:17.622
l also have a version
where we dig a tunnel.

42:19.832 --> 42:20.750
Hey!

42:20.792 --> 42:23.002
Bloody catapult.
Jesus Christ!

42:23.086 --> 42:25.338
-You don't need a catapult!
-Who asked you?

42:25.380 --> 42:27.507
You don't interrupt grown-ups
when they're talking.

42:27.549 --> 42:30.468
"Lord Nelson Rathbone requests
the pleasure of your company

42:30.510 --> 42:31.636
at the jubilee ball

42:31.678 --> 42:35.515
in honor of Her Majesty's
50th year on the throne."

42:35.557 --> 42:36.975
Sounds good.

42:37.058 --> 42:39.018
lt doesn't address security.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.770
They're not gonna let
Chon and l

42:40.854 --> 42:42.272
waltz into the castle.

42:42.355 --> 42:44.774
All you need is
a proper disguise.

42:46.568 --> 42:49.195
l do like a good disguise.

43:13.595 --> 43:15.096
l look like a fool.

43:15.180 --> 43:18.057
What?! You're a maharaja.
That's lndian royalty.

43:18.099 --> 43:21.352
-But l'm Chinese.
-lt's the same thing.

43:21.436 --> 43:23.521
Bob your head a little bit.

43:23.605 --> 43:26.316
Gives you more
of a lndia-royalty flavor.

43:26.399 --> 43:29.360
That's good.
Good show, good show.

43:29.444 --> 43:30.612
Good show, good show.

43:30.653 --> 43:33.198
-Cheerio, cheerio.
-Cheerio, cheerio.

43:33.239 --> 43:35.033
What do we do
when we see Rathbone?

43:35.116 --> 43:36.034
Kill him.

43:36.117 --> 43:38.036
No, okay? No!

43:38.077 --> 43:40.914
You're gonna be civil,
'cause we don't have the seal.

43:40.955 --> 43:45.877
No seal. No Lin.
No family honor. Okay?

43:45.919 --> 43:48.338
Be cool.
Okay, we look great.

43:48.379 --> 43:49.881
Let's enjoy this party.

43:52.967 --> 43:55.136
-Whoa. What are you doing?
-l'm going inside.

43:55.178 --> 43:57.847
-The place is haunted.
-You're the harness man.

43:57.931 --> 43:59.307
You get back at the carriage.

43:59.307 --> 44:01.518
You wait in case we need
to make a quick getaway.

44:01.601 --> 44:02.602
Go on.
Man your post.

44:02.685 --> 44:04.229
You don't always get
what you want.

44:04.312 --> 44:06.773
Why are you so mean
to that boy?

44:06.814 --> 44:09.484
l see a lot of myself
in that kid.

44:09.567 --> 44:11.778
lt's kind of freaking me out.
Come on.

44:22.247 --> 44:23.957
Your name, please, sir.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.170
So l can announce you.

44:37.637 --> 44:41.057
Sherlock... Holmes.

44:41.182 --> 44:43.017
Sherlock Holmes.

44:44.602 --> 44:47.647
Which province do you represent,
Your Highness?

44:50.567 --> 44:53.278
Nevada.

45:13.047 --> 45:16.968
May l present
Major General Sherlock Holmes

45:17.010 --> 45:21.055
and His Highness,
the maharaja of Nevada.

45:34.152 --> 45:37.113
How are the security
arrangements?

45:37.197 --> 45:40.366
Oh, everything seems to be
going swimmingly, my Lord.

45:40.408 --> 45:41.618
And if l may say so...

45:41.701 --> 45:44.329
it is an honor to guard
Your Lordship tonight.

45:44.370 --> 45:46.831
l speak for all of us
at Scotland Yard

45:46.915 --> 45:49.876
when l say that no matter how
far you are from the throne...

45:49.918 --> 45:52.545
you'll always be number one
in our hearts.

45:58.426 --> 46:00.220
Okay, here's the plan.

46:00.303 --> 46:01.804
We're gonna get
a little chow.

46:01.888 --> 46:03.598
Then we're gonna
sneak out of here.

46:03.681 --> 46:06.100
-Start looking for that seal.
-Okay.

46:06.184 --> 46:08.311
-Spotted Dick, sir?
-What?

46:08.394 --> 46:10.104
Spotted Dick.

46:12.482 --> 46:13.733
Can you believe this guy?

46:13.775 --> 46:14.859
l'm trying to get
something to eat.

46:14.943 --> 46:16.819
He's asking me
if l got the clap.

46:16.903 --> 46:19.822
l think
he's offering you food.

46:20.907 --> 46:22.867
Oh. Spotted Dick.

46:22.951 --> 46:24.410
Oh, no.
l think l'll pass.

46:24.494 --> 46:25.912
l'm not really
a dessert man.

46:25.995 --> 46:29.290
Perhaps my friend might like
some Spotted Dick.

46:31.334 --> 46:33.294
l might try
one of these sausages.

46:33.336 --> 46:35.088
A little smoky Joe.

46:37.465 --> 46:40.051
This is good!

46:40.134 --> 46:42.220
l thought the food here
was supposed to suck.

46:42.303 --> 46:44.472
The haggis is fresh
from Scotland, sir.

46:44.556 --> 46:47.267
lt's made from
the finest sheeps' bladders.

46:51.771 --> 46:54.482
l'm gonna get some whiskey
and wash my mouth out.

46:59.821 --> 47:01.489
You should try the quail.

47:03.950 --> 47:06.035
l shot them myself
this morning.

47:06.786 --> 47:09.122
How do you do, Your Lordship?

47:09.163 --> 47:11.916
Very well, thank you.

47:11.958 --> 47:15.295
l'm not acquainted
with the Nevada province.

47:18.464 --> 47:21.050
But l haven't been to lndia
since '81.

47:21.134 --> 47:23.553
l spent most of my time
in the Orient.

47:23.636 --> 47:26.222
l hear you've just returned
from China.

47:26.306 --> 47:29.434
You are well-informed,
maharaja.

47:29.517 --> 47:31.728
lt is my dream
that the Chinese people

47:31.811 --> 47:35.148
will follow lndia's example and
one day embrace British rule.

47:35.190 --> 47:36.774
The Chinese are very proud.

47:36.858 --> 47:40.278
They place family and honor
above all else.

47:40.361 --> 47:43.823
Well, l'm sure
we can break them of that.

47:47.994 --> 47:50.413
lf you'll excuse me,
l have a matter to attend to.

47:50.496 --> 47:52.832
Until we meet again.

47:58.087 --> 48:01.007
Patience.
l'm proud of you, Chon.

48:01.049 --> 48:03.551
We must find the seal.

48:06.054 --> 48:07.305
What do you see?

48:07.388 --> 48:09.349
Shh, shh, shh!

48:12.727 --> 48:16.272
He just pulled a fancy
dragon key out of his desk.

48:16.356 --> 48:17.815
That was my father's!

48:17.857 --> 48:19.359
l must avenge his honor.

48:19.442 --> 48:21.861
Hey, slow down, tiger.
Slow down.

48:21.903 --> 48:24.405
Quit going all Chinese on me.

48:28.284 --> 48:29.369
Where is he?

48:29.452 --> 48:32.163
Damn it. Remember
your puzzle box. Patience.

48:33.373 --> 48:35.583
Okay, there are no windows.

48:35.667 --> 48:37.669
We just came in
through the only doorway.

48:37.752 --> 48:39.420
That leaves one explanation.

48:39.504 --> 48:41.256
Remember in "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy"

48:41.339 --> 48:42.507
how the zombie king got away

48:42.549 --> 48:44.384
when l chased him
into the pharaoh's tomb?

48:44.467 --> 48:47.178
There's a secret passageway
behind the sphinx.

48:47.262 --> 48:50.640
There's gotta be a lever
or a button over here.

48:50.723 --> 48:52.725
Help me lift some stuff up.

49:06.656 --> 49:07.657
Roy!

49:07.740 --> 49:10.118
The painting.
lt's looking at me.

49:10.159 --> 49:11.411
-Look!
-Oh, yeah.

49:11.494 --> 49:13.580
Looks like it's looking at me.
That's great.

49:13.663 --> 49:15.832
No, real eyes.
Moving!

49:15.915 --> 49:18.251
That kid got to you,
didn't he?

49:18.334 --> 49:20.628
Unbelievable!
We're not in a haunted house.

49:20.670 --> 49:22.755
That's a technique
that an artist uses.

49:22.797 --> 49:25.800
"Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant
eyes" is the technical term.

49:25.884 --> 49:28.887
lt's unnerving, though.
l'll give you that.

49:32.974 --> 49:36.936
Roy.
Now, those eyes. Look!

49:36.978 --> 49:38.438
Whatever you say, Chon.

49:43.568 --> 49:46.362
Let's see what you got here,
Rathbone.

49:51.743 --> 49:52.952
Roy!

49:55.288 --> 49:58.291
What, Chon?
Are the statues moving now?

50:36.246 --> 50:37.038
Roy!

50:37.789 --> 50:42.001
l can't hear myself think
with you shouting at me.

50:43.169 --> 50:44.295
Chon?

50:46.339 --> 50:49.509
Chon? Chon?

50:50.844 --> 50:52.095
This is ridiculous.

50:52.178 --> 50:54.806
lf you want to act
like a child and play games...

50:54.848 --> 50:56.349
then find someone else...

50:56.391 --> 50:57.809
'cause l take
this stuff seriously.

50:57.892 --> 51:00.687
l'm here to work.
l'm on a mission.

51:02.564 --> 51:03.648
Chon?

51:05.358 --> 51:06.526
Okay, Chon.

51:06.609 --> 51:09.696
Okay, you little
Chinese otter.

51:09.737 --> 51:11.072
Let's play.

51:26.796 --> 51:27.922
Chon, demons!

51:46.816 --> 51:49.694
She's gonna fight
my battles for me.

51:49.777 --> 51:52.488
Come on.
Let's go.

51:53.615 --> 51:56.159
What? What are you doing?

51:56.242 --> 51:58.786
lt's kinky.
l like it.

52:05.752 --> 52:08.338
Wow! Look at this.

53:17.740 --> 53:20.243
Wait. There's something
different about this room.

53:33.548 --> 53:34.591
Hey.

54:03.953 --> 54:05.663
Let's go!

54:06.873 --> 54:08.750
-Wang!
-Chon, for God's sakes.

54:08.833 --> 54:11.044
-Now he shows up.
-l found it.

54:11.085 --> 54:13.004
Wait. Do you want to hear?

54:13.588 --> 54:15.548
The seal's gone.

54:49.457 --> 54:50.500
Lin.

54:52.210 --> 54:53.294
Roy!

54:54.128 --> 54:56.297
Are we gonna come back?

54:56.381 --> 54:58.132
Roy!

55:07.725 --> 55:10.270
Must you keep doing that?

55:10.311 --> 55:13.481
l was taught
not to be seen or heard.

55:14.983 --> 55:16.109
The seal.

55:16.150 --> 55:17.902
l am a man of my word.

55:21.489 --> 55:24.242
l remember watching
my brother play with this

55:24.325 --> 55:25.785
like a baby rattle.

55:27.662 --> 55:32.166
When l'd try to touch it,
the dowager empress beat me.

55:33.209 --> 55:35.253
No doubt
your deprived childhood

55:35.336 --> 55:37.589
made you into the man
you are today.

55:37.672 --> 55:39.799
Wu Chow.

55:39.841 --> 55:41.467
Wu who?

55:41.509 --> 55:43.803
He is the emperor's
bastard brother.

55:43.887 --> 55:46.347
He was banished
from the Forbidden City

55:46.389 --> 55:48.224
for trying to steal
the lmperial Seal.

55:48.308 --> 55:49.601
Our father caught him.

55:49.642 --> 55:52.645
He vowed to return to claim
the emperor's throne.

55:52.687 --> 55:55.440
This guy?

55:55.523 --> 55:58.026
l'll assume everything
has been arranged as discussed.

55:58.151 --> 56:01.029
You have nothing to worry about.
lt's all in place.

56:01.029 --> 56:04.157
That diamond is as big
as a damn monkey's paw.

56:04.199 --> 56:05.742
-Look at that.
-Roy.

56:05.825 --> 56:07.452
Don't even think about it.

56:07.535 --> 56:10.246
l'm just admiring
the craftsmanship, Chon.

56:10.330 --> 56:13.708
So for now,
our business is completed.

56:21.382 --> 56:22.675
Where's Lin?!

56:36.981 --> 56:38.024
Hey! Hey!

56:43.071 --> 56:44.489
Gotcha!

56:46.157 --> 56:48.576
Just looking out
for number one.

56:48.660 --> 56:49.494
No!

56:50.203 --> 56:51.704
The kid got the seal!

57:08.513 --> 57:09.848
Chon!

57:19.023 --> 57:20.191
lt's stuck.

57:29.701 --> 57:30.451
Lin!

57:42.797 --> 57:44.883
Go! You can do it!

57:44.966 --> 57:48.303
She's got it.

57:48.386 --> 57:49.429
She's got it!

57:49.512 --> 57:51.973
Roy! Come on!

57:52.015 --> 57:54.434
Chon, what in our history
together

57:54.517 --> 57:56.978
makes you think l'm capable
of something like that?

57:57.103 --> 57:58.646
-Roy!
-l can't do that!

57:58.688 --> 57:59.606
Hurry up!

57:59.647 --> 58:01.649
Wait.

58:01.733 --> 58:03.443
There's a better way.

58:13.953 --> 58:15.079
Slow down!

58:15.163 --> 58:16.581
l'm a bat out of hell!

58:16.623 --> 58:18.374
Yee-haw!

58:18.458 --> 58:19.792
Besides, l don't know
where the brake is.

58:19.876 --> 58:20.877
What?!

58:24.589 --> 58:26.424
Look out!

58:48.363 --> 58:49.989
So, what now, buddy?

58:50.031 --> 58:53.451
Relax, relax.
Smooth sailing from here.

59:02.710 --> 59:05.839
Yes, these are the men
who attacked me.

59:05.922 --> 59:10.176
l'm afraid the assailants have
temporarily eluded us, my Lord.

59:10.218 --> 59:12.178
Perhaps you could explain
to me

59:12.220 --> 59:15.306
how Loony Lin
managed to escape

59:15.390 --> 59:18.017
from the confines of
Scotland Yard under the watch

59:18.101 --> 59:22.564
of the most respected
police force in the world.

59:22.605 --> 59:25.733
Yes, of course.
lt's absolutely fascinating.

59:25.817 --> 59:27.902
She picked the lock

59:27.986 --> 59:31.364
using a deck of rather
risque playing cards.

59:31.447 --> 59:35.743
Then scaled the walls
with a mop, a fork...

59:35.785 --> 59:38.204
and various pilfered
undergarments.

59:38.288 --> 59:39.956
You've got to hand it
to the Chinese.

59:40.039 --> 59:42.625
They're awfully ingenious,
Lord, aren't they?

59:43.918 --> 59:46.337
Does your incompetence know
no bounds?!

01:00:15.825 --> 01:00:17.702
Where am l?

01:00:18.828 --> 01:00:21.080
Lin!

01:00:21.122 --> 01:00:23.291
l don't even know these women.

01:00:26.503 --> 01:00:30.256
Lin, what are you doing here?

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.091
Oh, Lord.

01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:35.011
Do you want to try
the position on page 3 7?

01:00:40.058 --> 01:00:42.393
Come here, you little minx.

01:00:44.312 --> 01:00:46.231
What?

01:00:58.826 --> 01:01:00.787
-You okay?
-No, l'm not okay.

01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:03.206
l've just been violated
by a barnyard animal.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.922
Who would leave a pile of stones
in the middle of the field?

01:01:11.005 --> 01:01:14.050
l don't know, Chon.
These people are nuts.

01:01:15.677 --> 01:01:17.011
Come on.

01:01:20.473 --> 01:01:24.519
-Can l tell you something?
-What?

01:01:24.602 --> 01:01:26.938
This is a hell
of a damn adventure we're on.

01:01:27.021 --> 01:01:29.232
l'm having
an absolute ball with you.

01:01:31.734 --> 01:01:33.069
Me too.

01:01:37.866 --> 01:01:39.701
Here we go.

01:01:39.784 --> 01:01:41.619
Get your thumb out, maharaja.

01:01:41.703 --> 01:01:43.162
-Why?
-Get over here.

01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:45.957
Excuse me!

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:49.210
-Lin!
-Lin!

01:01:57.302 --> 01:01:59.804
My shoulder's getting
a little tight.

01:02:00.972 --> 01:02:03.474
This is your first time
in England, isn't it?

01:02:04.475 --> 01:02:07.395
How do you know your way around?
lt's incredible.

01:02:07.478 --> 01:02:09.898
l always had a good sense
of direction.

01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:11.858
You can say that again.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.236
l wish we could say the same
about you-know-who.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.030
l once sent him over
a mountain range.

01:02:17.071 --> 01:02:18.489
He was lost forever.

01:02:19.574 --> 01:02:22.202
One time, l sent him
over the Great Wall.

01:02:22.285 --> 01:02:26.039
-He was lost for three days.
-Three days?!

01:02:27.582 --> 01:02:30.418
Oh, gosh, we got a lot
in common.

01:02:30.502 --> 01:02:32.921
l've never met
anybody like you, Roy.

01:02:33.004 --> 01:02:34.839
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:02:35.757 --> 01:02:39.636
Hey, can l tell you something
without you getting offended?

01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:41.012
What?

01:02:41.095 --> 01:02:44.224
You have a great body.

01:02:44.265 --> 01:02:47.227
There. l said it.
lt's out in the open.

01:02:49.562 --> 01:02:52.148
-You must work out.
-Me?

01:02:52.232 --> 01:02:53.399
Excuse me.

01:02:55.443 --> 01:02:58.029
Chon, what are you doing?

01:02:58.112 --> 01:03:00.490
l don't like the backseat.

01:03:00.532 --> 01:03:03.868
Makes me sick. Dizzy.

01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:12.544
Whitechapel.

01:03:12.627 --> 01:03:15.046
This looks like
a nice enough neighborhood.

01:03:18.258 --> 01:03:20.802
-What is Puss 'n' Boots?
-lt's a boardinghouse.

01:03:20.885 --> 01:03:24.264
Some of the sailors on the ship
coming over recommended it.

01:03:28.601 --> 01:03:31.271
Come on. Come on!

01:03:39.487 --> 01:03:41.197
l won't let my sister
stay here.

01:03:41.281 --> 01:03:43.408
What are we supposed to do?
Check in to the Savoy?

01:03:43.491 --> 01:03:45.285
We'll get arrested
before we get to our room.

01:03:45.368 --> 01:03:47.036
l don't mind this place.

01:03:50.999 --> 01:03:54.878
See?
She's a little open-minded.

01:03:55.503 --> 01:03:57.422
l know this sounds crazy
'cause l just met her...

01:03:57.505 --> 01:04:00.300
but l think l'm falling for her.

01:04:00.341 --> 01:04:01.593
l think she's the one.

01:04:01.676 --> 01:04:03.386
Roy, she's my baby sister.

01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:05.513
l know she is.
Thank God!

01:04:05.597 --> 01:04:06.973
That's the only chance
l've got.

01:04:07.056 --> 01:04:09.017
l'm getting ready
to launch a little thing

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.852
called
"Operation Sweep Her Off Her Feet."

01:04:10.935 --> 01:04:12.979
You're in a position
to talk me up.

01:04:13.062 --> 01:04:14.397
Can l count on you?

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.524
Please, buddy, l've never
asked you for anything.

01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:18.985
Sure, Roy.
l'll tell her the truth.

01:04:19.027 --> 01:04:20.403
Don't get hung up on the truth.

01:04:20.486 --> 01:04:23.031
Feel free to smooth out
your old pal's rough edges.

01:04:25.116 --> 01:04:27.202
l love you, buddy.

01:04:30.914 --> 01:04:33.625
Lin. Come.

01:04:38.379 --> 01:04:39.672
Sit.

01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:06.741
Hello, love.

01:05:06.783 --> 01:05:08.201
Fancy a tumble?

01:05:08.243 --> 01:05:11.454
Oh!
Where were you two days ago?

01:05:11.538 --> 01:05:13.706
l would have bedded you
in a second.

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.416
Now you're looking
at a changed man.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.503
l'm sort of saving myself
for someone special.

01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:20.421
l'll give you a discount.

01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:26.010
That's the most romantic thing
any woman's ever said to me.

01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:28.263
You better go.

01:05:28.346 --> 01:05:30.473
You better go
before we lose control. Go!

01:05:30.557 --> 01:05:32.725
lf you change your mind...

01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:33.852
Roy!

01:05:42.277 --> 01:05:45.613
Our father would talk about
the right man for you.

01:05:45.697 --> 01:05:48.658
He must be strong,
courageous...

01:05:48.741 --> 01:05:51.286
and a good father.

01:05:51.369 --> 01:05:53.746
-Like Roy.
-We got her, Chon.

01:05:53.788 --> 01:05:55.582
Not like Roy.

01:05:55.623 --> 01:05:57.417
You don't know him like l do.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.378
He has many bad habits.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.588
Such as?

01:06:01.629 --> 01:06:05.425
He drinks, smokes,
and he gambles.

01:06:05.508 --> 01:06:07.093
Chon, where are you
going with this?

01:06:07.177 --> 01:06:09.095
He sleeps with women for money.

01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:10.430
What are you --

01:06:10.513 --> 01:06:14.434
Roy don't do that.
l can see inside him.

01:06:14.517 --> 01:06:15.935
He has a good heart.

01:06:15.977 --> 01:06:17.103
That's right.

01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:20.565
His salmon don't swim
upstream.

01:06:20.648 --> 01:06:21.941
He shoots blanks.

01:06:23.318 --> 01:06:25.778
Lin, he cannot be trusted.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.324
How could you say that?
You're his friend.

01:06:29.407 --> 01:06:31.868
Yeah, sort of.

01:06:31.951 --> 01:06:33.369
Roy is the type of a friend

01:06:33.453 --> 01:06:35.788
you'd never introduce
to your other friends

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:37.624
or bring home to your family.

01:06:37.665 --> 01:06:40.418
He never speak the truth.
You know what l call him?

01:06:40.502 --> 01:06:43.338
Not Roy O'Bannon.
Roy O'Baloney.

01:06:44.923 --> 01:06:46.591
l don't care.

01:06:46.633 --> 01:06:48.760
Lin, l forbid it.

01:06:49.802 --> 01:06:51.804
You are not my father.

01:07:02.106 --> 01:07:04.692
Roy, there you are.

01:07:04.776 --> 01:07:07.320
-Hi.
-Mm-hmm.

01:07:07.362 --> 01:07:10.490
You need anything, buddy?

01:07:10.532 --> 01:07:13.660
A whole lot of
"leave me alone."

01:07:16.204 --> 01:07:17.539
What's wrong?

01:07:19.874 --> 01:07:20.834
Nothing.

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:22.836
l woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:26.047
l feel a little pain in my back
like someone put a knife there.

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:27.882
l'm okay.

01:07:27.966 --> 01:07:29.801
Don't worry about me.

01:07:39.102 --> 01:07:40.895
Roy!

01:07:47.026 --> 01:07:49.279
That actually reminds me
of a trick.

01:07:49.362 --> 01:07:51.322
You ever seen this one?!

01:07:51.406 --> 01:07:52.532
Or this one?!

01:07:53.575 --> 01:07:56.244
You think you're so cool
with your karate

01:07:56.327 --> 01:07:58.913
and your childlike reflexes.

01:08:01.416 --> 01:08:02.750
Roy, you okay?

01:08:03.418 --> 01:08:05.503
Look at you.

01:08:05.587 --> 01:08:08.506
Do you really call me
Roy Baloney?

01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:13.344
Roy, you don't understand.

01:08:13.428 --> 01:08:16.264
You just smashed
my puzzle box.

01:08:17.307 --> 01:08:19.392
l'll never figure out
my message.

01:08:19.475 --> 01:08:21.310
-Roy...
-Go.

01:08:23.354 --> 01:08:25.148
You're dead to me.

01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:27.609
l don't know a Chon Wang.

01:08:41.622 --> 01:08:42.624
What?

01:08:42.707 --> 01:08:44.917
Hi, Roy.

01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:47.754
Who loves you, baby?

01:08:47.837 --> 01:08:50.506
-Nice try, Chon.
-Roy...

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:52.258
l'm sorry.

01:08:57.471 --> 01:09:00.308
You do that again,
and you're a dead man.

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:12.153
Pillow fight!

01:09:39.848 --> 01:09:41.432
l am Roy Baloney!

01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:42.517
Yes!

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600
l'm full of it!

01:09:43.643 --> 01:09:44.978
You are!

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.007
Roy?

01:10:14.048 --> 01:10:17.677
-Roy?

01:10:19.846 --> 01:10:20.763
Lin!

01:10:25.727 --> 01:10:27.645
lt was his idea.

01:10:28.897 --> 01:10:30.231
-Chon!
-Clothes!

01:11:02.847 --> 01:11:04.516
Nice night for a walk.

01:11:13.274 --> 01:11:14.234
Lin!

01:11:14.317 --> 01:11:15.777
-Lin!
-There you are!

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:16.861
What are you doing?

01:11:16.903 --> 01:11:19.572
Don't you know there's
a serial killer on the loose?

01:11:19.656 --> 01:11:21.407
Forget it.

01:11:29.374 --> 01:11:31.209
Who the hell are these guys?

01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:32.210
Boxers.

01:11:32.252 --> 01:11:33.753
What do they want with us?

01:11:33.795 --> 01:11:36.047
They're with me.

01:11:38.508 --> 01:11:41.886
l think we need to have
a little chat.

01:11:51.396 --> 01:11:53.523
Chon Wang --

01:11:53.606 --> 01:11:56.359
the man who can fight
an emperor.

01:11:56.442 --> 01:11:59.112
The emperor should never have
his burial knife.

01:11:59.195 --> 01:12:00.822
l see.

01:12:00.864 --> 01:12:03.324
You're still
my brother's lapdog.

01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:05.243
l'm here not for him.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.121
l'm here for my father.

01:12:08.204 --> 01:12:10.081
Of course you are.

01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:16.754
lt was my dagger
that plunged into his heart.

01:12:16.838 --> 01:12:18.840
lt's still crusted
with his blood.

01:12:23.678 --> 01:12:26.055
l know the boy has the seal.

01:12:26.139 --> 01:12:27.307
Where is he?

01:12:27.348 --> 01:12:28.433
We don't know.

01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:30.435
That's the truth --
we don't know.

01:12:30.518 --> 01:12:32.353
Mmm...

01:12:33.313 --> 01:12:35.773
What are you --
What are you doing?

01:12:39.694 --> 01:12:41.321
Stop! Put her down!

01:12:42.405 --> 01:12:43.948
Put her down!
Put her down!

01:12:44.032 --> 01:12:45.783
Or what, Mr. O'Bannon?

01:12:45.867 --> 01:12:48.203
Are you gonna kick my ass?

01:12:48.286 --> 01:12:51.497
l've read all about
your ridiculous exploits.

01:12:51.623 --> 01:12:53.041
l mean, just...

01:12:53.124 --> 01:12:57.378
how does it feel to kill
a mummy with your bare hands?

01:12:57.504 --> 01:12:59.672
Only a nation
of uneducated rednecks

01:12:59.672 --> 01:13:02.383
would be amused
by such cowboy drivel.

01:13:02.425 --> 01:13:04.511
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.

01:13:04.552 --> 01:13:06.846
What's with
the personal attacks?

01:13:06.888 --> 01:13:08.598
You don't see me
making any comments

01:13:08.681 --> 01:13:12.060
about your pasty complexion
or your snotty accent

01:13:12.143 --> 01:13:15.146
or even your filthy,
smutty sex books.

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.232
Yeah, l saw your book.
lt disgusted me.

01:13:19.859 --> 01:13:22.278
Oh, why is it always the head
with you people?!

01:13:23.947 --> 01:13:26.658
Hold it! Stop! Hold it!

01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:27.825
Just hold it!

01:13:27.909 --> 01:13:30.828
What are we doing here?
Guys, look at this.

01:13:30.912 --> 01:13:33.540
We're acting like animals...
over what?

01:13:33.623 --> 01:13:34.832
Some seal?

01:13:34.916 --> 01:13:37.502
The seal represents
imperial power.

01:13:38.253 --> 01:13:40.964
l will use it to unite
the emperor's enemies

01:13:41.047 --> 01:13:44.008
and storm the Forbidden City.

01:13:44.092 --> 01:13:45.510
What's in it for you?

01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:47.762
You're looking
at the future king of England.

01:13:47.846 --> 01:13:49.764
You're, like, 20th in line
to the throne.

01:13:49.806 --> 01:13:51.099
10th.

01:13:51.182 --> 01:13:53.309
But my friend
is about to change all that

01:13:53.393 --> 01:13:56.771
by simple...
process of elimination.

01:14:00.942 --> 01:14:02.986
lt's called a machine gun.

01:14:03.069 --> 01:14:06.364
The first of its kind --
it fires 200 rounds a minute.

01:14:06.447 --> 01:14:08.700
Testament to British ingenuity.

01:14:08.783 --> 01:14:11.619
Oh, so you steal the seal,

01:14:11.703 --> 01:14:13.788
and then you knock off
nine royals?

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.084
You got the short end
of that stick, my friend.

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:23.673
Dump them in the river.

01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:26.968
Where are you taking her?

01:14:27.051 --> 01:14:28.928
To make history.

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:31.181
l can already see
the headlines --

01:14:31.264 --> 01:14:35.435
"Nation mourns as Loony Lin
massacres royal family."

01:14:49.324 --> 01:14:53.745
l need your assurance
that you will find the seal.

01:14:53.828 --> 01:14:55.455
Don't concern yourself.

01:14:55.496 --> 01:14:57.540
My men are scouring the city.

01:14:57.582 --> 01:15:02.670
You better pray they find it...
or our agreement is over,

01:15:02.712 --> 01:15:07.091
and you will never get
the crown.

01:15:13.765 --> 01:15:16.601
Chon, l got a confession
to make.

01:15:16.643 --> 01:15:18.853
You are in love
with my sister.

01:15:18.937 --> 01:15:20.939
Well, that, but...

01:15:21.022 --> 01:15:23.691
l didn't lose all the money
on the zeppelins.

01:15:23.775 --> 01:15:25.193
No?

01:15:25.276 --> 01:15:29.572
Nah. l blew most of it
on the Roy O'Bannon novels.

01:15:29.656 --> 01:15:31.074
l wrote them.

01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:32.784
No, Sage McCallister
wrote them.

01:15:32.867 --> 01:15:36.037
That's what l'm saying, buddy.
l'm Sage McCallister.

01:15:41.042 --> 01:15:42.502
You wrote those lies?!

01:15:42.627 --> 01:15:44.504
l've always had
low self-esteem.

01:15:44.546 --> 01:15:46.047
How many books did you print?

01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:48.299
l self-published
probably a million copies.

01:15:49.342 --> 01:15:51.344
We were actually second
to the Bible that year.

01:15:51.386 --> 01:15:52.262
Oh, you --

01:15:52.345 --> 01:15:54.472
l guess l'm just about
the worst friend

01:15:54.514 --> 01:15:56.683
a guy could ask for.

01:15:58.059 --> 01:16:01.396
No, you're a good friend.

01:16:01.479 --> 01:16:02.564
Thank you.

01:16:02.647 --> 01:16:06.025
lf you really love Lin,
l won't stand in the way.

01:16:06.109 --> 01:16:07.193
Really?

01:16:07.277 --> 01:16:11.489
But if you break her heart...
l'll break your legs.

01:16:11.573 --> 01:16:12.657
That's fair.

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:17.453
Well,
friends to the end, Chon...

01:16:17.537 --> 01:16:19.205
and this is the end.

01:16:23.918 --> 01:16:25.295
Chon, you got a plan?

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.880
You wouldn't happen to have
a plan, would you?

01:16:26.963 --> 01:16:28.006
Yes.

01:16:28.089 --> 01:16:29.883
-Anything l can do?
-No.

01:16:29.924 --> 01:16:32.760
Good. l'll let you do
the heavy lifting, then.

01:16:47.692 --> 01:16:49.611
Chon, hurry.

01:16:55.158 --> 01:16:56.117
Chon!

01:16:56.201 --> 01:16:57.243
Chon! Chon, hurry!

01:16:57.368 --> 01:16:58.494
Hurry!

01:16:58.536 --> 01:17:00.246
Hurry! Chon, hurry!

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:01.331
Roy!

01:17:05.293 --> 01:17:06.669
Coming!

01:17:08.463 --> 01:17:09.380
Chon!

01:17:13.092 --> 01:17:14.594
The water's so dirty!

01:17:14.677 --> 01:17:16.804
No! No! lt's dirty! No!

01:17:44.541 --> 01:17:48.002
Just go ahead and drown me.
l don't care anymore.

01:17:51.714 --> 01:17:52.215
Roy!

01:18:52.025 --> 01:18:53.943
You look ridiculous.

01:18:55.653 --> 01:18:57.155
l think we look good.

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:02.535
l really must protest
this intrusion.

01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:05.747
Every bobby in London is out
scouring the streets

01:19:05.788 --> 01:19:06.748
for you two.

01:19:06.789 --> 01:19:08.249
Have you been drinking?

01:19:08.291 --> 01:19:11.669
l always drink when my
employment's been terminated.

01:19:11.753 --> 01:19:12.795
They fired you?

01:19:12.879 --> 01:19:14.797
Lord Rathbone saw to that.

01:19:14.881 --> 01:19:15.882
l'm sorry.

01:19:16.925 --> 01:19:18.384
lt's of no consequence.

01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:21.888
l never wanted to be
an inspector in the first place.

01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:24.390
lt was my father's idea.

01:19:24.432 --> 01:19:26.601
l always wanted to be
a writer.

01:19:27.727 --> 01:19:28.811
Yeah.

01:19:28.937 --> 01:19:30.688
Artie, we need your help.

01:19:30.772 --> 01:19:32.315
Rathbone has taken Lin.

01:19:32.398 --> 01:19:33.858
He's gonna kill
the royal family

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.360
and he's gonna assume
the throne.

01:19:35.443 --> 01:19:37.904
Do you have any evidence

01:19:37.946 --> 01:19:40.990
to support these
preposterous allegations?

01:19:41.074 --> 01:19:43.743
We have this.
lt's the boy's.

01:19:43.785 --> 01:19:46.538
Use your technique.
Tell us where he is.

01:19:48.581 --> 01:19:51.000
Paraffin wax --
most interesting.

01:19:51.084 --> 01:19:52.502
He's at a church.

01:19:52.585 --> 01:19:54.379
The little punk's hiding
in a church.

01:19:54.462 --> 01:19:55.922
No, no, no.

01:19:56.047 --> 01:19:57.924
lt's not candle wax.

01:19:58.007 --> 01:19:59.175
l have it.

01:20:02.971 --> 01:20:04.764
-Don't worry. You'll get it.
-What are you doing?

01:20:04.806 --> 01:20:06.766
-He's picking the lock.
-Well, hurry up!

01:20:06.808 --> 01:20:10.103
Chon, please! Please.
lt's a very meticulous process.

01:20:10.144 --> 01:20:13.565
Let Artie do his job.
lt's almost an art form.

01:20:13.606 --> 01:20:15.733
lt takes the precision
of a surgeon.

01:20:15.859 --> 01:20:18.111
You have to be so precise.

01:20:18.152 --> 01:20:20.488
Maybe if we jam
another one in there.

01:20:24.951 --> 01:20:26.494
That works, too.

01:20:26.578 --> 01:20:28.788
Lacks a certain finesse.

01:20:32.292 --> 01:20:34.460
All right, all right.
Let's split up.

01:21:41.152 --> 01:21:42.362
What the...

01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:48.451
l am gonna break your neck.

01:21:48.493 --> 01:21:49.369
Come here.

01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:31.411
Looky here.

01:22:31.452 --> 01:22:33.580
-Come on, where is it?
-What?

01:22:33.663 --> 01:22:35.290
You know
what l'm talking about.

01:22:35.331 --> 01:22:36.791
Don't give me that "what."

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:38.793
What do we got here?

01:22:38.877 --> 01:22:40.545
Oh, yes.

01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:43.965
You don't mind
if l take this back, do you?

01:22:44.048 --> 01:22:45.592
Go on.
Get out of here.

01:22:45.675 --> 01:22:46.593
Go!

01:22:46.676 --> 01:22:47.635
Roy?

01:22:47.719 --> 01:22:48.887
l got it.

01:22:52.015 --> 01:22:53.683
Give me the seal.

01:22:54.642 --> 01:22:56.811
Give me the seal!

01:23:09.365 --> 01:23:11.743
All right, spread out!

01:23:11.784 --> 01:23:12.911
Through there!

01:23:14.245 --> 01:23:15.663
Let's go.

01:23:24.839 --> 01:23:26.841
The gig's up.

01:23:36.142 --> 01:23:38.228
So, what are we gonna do?

01:23:41.022 --> 01:23:42.315
Come on, think!

01:23:42.357 --> 01:23:44.651
l'm not going
to an English prison.

01:23:44.692 --> 01:23:47.570
With my feathery blond hair
and Chon's athletic build,

01:23:47.654 --> 01:23:49.572
they'll try to make us
the belle of the ball.

01:23:49.656 --> 01:23:51.699
Forget it.
l'm not going back.

01:23:53.034 --> 01:23:56.246
Well, at least we'll get
a good view of the fireworks

01:23:56.329 --> 01:23:57.580
from Scotland Yard.

01:23:57.664 --> 01:23:59.541
-Fireworks?
-Yeah.

01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:02.001
At midnight, they're launching
this huge display

01:24:02.126 --> 01:24:03.878
from a flotilla of barges
on the Thames.

01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:06.881
lt's the official kickoff
to the Queen's Jubilee.

01:24:06.923 --> 01:24:08.842
ls the royal family
gonna be there?

01:24:09.551 --> 01:24:12.303
They're gonna be viewing
the spectacle from a balcony

01:24:12.345 --> 01:24:13.888
overlooking the river.

01:24:13.972 --> 01:24:15.932
He's got a machine gun
on the barge.

01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:18.810
Yes.

01:24:27.819 --> 01:24:29.779
You gents lost your way?

01:24:29.863 --> 01:24:31.406
Kid, tell me
you got a way out.

01:24:44.502 --> 01:24:46.629
Nice move, kid.

01:24:46.713 --> 01:24:48.089
So why did you come back?

01:24:48.173 --> 01:24:50.758
Why did you give up the seal?

01:24:53.469 --> 01:24:55.054
'Cause l'm a fool.

01:24:56.848 --> 01:24:58.474
Guess l'm a fool, too.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.685
Well, put her there, fool.

01:25:01.895 --> 01:25:03.062
l never got your name.

01:25:03.146 --> 01:25:05.273
Name's Chaplin...

01:25:05.356 --> 01:25:07.400
Charlie Chaplin.

01:26:07.877 --> 01:26:09.379
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

01:26:09.462 --> 01:26:10.547
Excuse me, please!

01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:12.465
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

01:26:20.807 --> 01:26:22.350
You warn the royal family.

01:26:22.433 --> 01:26:23.434
l'll save Lin.

01:26:23.518 --> 01:26:25.395
How on earth are you gonna
do that?

01:27:52.815 --> 01:27:54.067
You okay?

01:28:00.281 --> 01:28:01.574
l just saved you!

01:28:01.616 --> 01:28:02.742
You were late!

01:28:02.742 --> 01:28:03.785
What?!

01:28:08.498 --> 01:28:09.666
Nelson?

01:28:22.762 --> 01:28:24.556
Why are you hiding yourself
back there?

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:26.808
l shouldn't like to impede
your view, Your Highness.

01:28:26.933 --> 01:28:28.768
Nonsense.
You arranged all this.

01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:30.728
You should have
a front-row view.

01:28:30.812 --> 01:28:34.315
l regret that, uh,
respectfully l must decline.

01:28:34.399 --> 01:28:37.068
l need to keep a good eye
on proceedings.

01:28:41.823 --> 01:28:44.200
Nelson,
you've outdone yourself.

01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:46.744
Wait till you see the finale.

01:28:51.124 --> 01:28:52.709
Hey!

01:28:55.128 --> 01:28:56.796
Hey!

01:30:08.159 --> 01:30:09.410
This is hopeless.

01:30:09.494 --> 01:30:11.412
We're not gonna get past
the guards.

01:30:11.496 --> 01:30:13.081
Well, not with that attitude
we won't.

01:30:13.122 --> 01:30:15.083
Come on, Artie.
There's got to be a way.

01:30:15.124 --> 01:30:17.126
There's always --

01:30:30.515 --> 01:30:31.850
Lin!

01:31:07.844 --> 01:31:10.096
Yee-haw! Yeah!

01:31:10.180 --> 01:31:11.890
Yee-haw!

01:31:11.973 --> 01:31:13.349
Yee-haw!

01:31:15.476 --> 01:31:17.061
We got to jump it!

01:32:08.154 --> 01:32:09.864
Wu Chow!

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.758
Hold it right there,
Rathboner.

01:32:31.594 --> 01:32:33.096
l'm guessing
by your hasty retreat

01:32:33.179 --> 01:32:35.598
that you're still
20th in line for the throne.

01:32:35.682 --> 01:32:36.891
10th.

01:32:36.975 --> 01:32:39.310
lnspector Doyle,
arrest this man.

01:32:43.022 --> 01:32:44.023
He's got a gun!

01:32:46.943 --> 01:32:47.944
Come on!

01:32:50.196 --> 01:32:51.281
-Oh!
-You okay?

01:32:51.364 --> 01:32:52.615
What happened?

01:32:52.699 --> 01:32:55.076
Rathbone nailed Artie
with a little sissy gun.

01:32:55.159 --> 01:32:57.453
l'll look after him.
You two go.

01:32:57.579 --> 01:32:59.289
Go!

01:33:06.713 --> 01:33:08.715
For Father.

01:33:08.798 --> 01:33:10.717
For Father.

01:33:10.758 --> 01:33:12.510
For Old Man Wang.

01:33:16.806 --> 01:33:19.809
Oh, my lucky playing cards.

01:33:27.901 --> 01:33:30.069
Be careful.

01:33:30.111 --> 01:33:32.947
Tell Rathbone to be careful.

01:33:33.031 --> 01:33:34.991
Roy, let's go.

01:33:41.831 --> 01:33:43.958
You're gonna need
a bigger gun!

01:34:01.893 --> 01:34:03.269
You see him?

01:34:03.311 --> 01:34:04.729
No.

01:34:04.812 --> 01:34:06.689
Show your face, Rathbone!

01:34:06.773 --> 01:34:08.191
l'm gonna tear this guy apart.

01:34:08.274 --> 01:34:10.652
Roy, you go this way.
l'll go that way.

01:34:10.735 --> 01:34:13.404
Split up? l don't know
if that's a good idea.

01:34:13.488 --> 01:34:14.614
lt's okay.

01:34:23.998 --> 01:34:25.834
He's not up here.

01:34:27.502 --> 01:34:29.128
Roy, keep going.

01:34:32.841 --> 01:34:34.801
Aw, come on, Roy.

01:34:47.814 --> 01:34:50.108
Hey, uh, Rathbone...

01:34:50.191 --> 01:34:53.444
l was just thinking
of a title for my new book...

01:34:53.528 --> 01:34:57.198
"Roy O'Bannon
vs. Little Lord Sissy."

01:34:57.323 --> 01:35:00.910
But what about "Roy O'Bannon vs.
The Man Who Would Be Queen"?

01:35:04.289 --> 01:35:05.540
No sign of him, Chon.

01:35:05.623 --> 01:35:07.792
The coast is clear up here.

01:35:13.506 --> 01:35:14.966
Roy! Look out!

01:35:17.552 --> 01:35:18.636
Roy!

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.971
Oops.

01:35:24.058 --> 01:35:25.393
Come on up.

01:35:25.476 --> 01:35:27.604
l'll show you
how your father died.

01:36:07.769 --> 01:36:09.854
Lord, help me.

01:36:09.938 --> 01:36:12.524
Just let me know you're there.
Love me. Hate me.

01:36:12.607 --> 01:36:14.901
But let me know
you're up there!

01:36:14.943 --> 01:36:17.237
Hey, l can see our hotel
from here.

01:36:31.292 --> 01:36:33.086
Come along.

01:36:33.127 --> 01:36:34.879
l'm waiting.

01:36:34.963 --> 01:36:38.174
Come on, Roy. Okay.

01:36:38.258 --> 01:36:40.343
Roy O'Bannon
will not go quietly.

01:36:40.426 --> 01:36:41.761
You hear that, England?!

01:36:41.803 --> 01:36:43.596
Throw whatever
you want at me --

01:36:43.638 --> 01:36:46.599
your terrible weather,
your perverted killers,

01:36:46.641 --> 01:36:48.643
your Spotted Dick!

01:37:25.513 --> 01:37:27.098
Roy, you're about to die.

01:37:27.182 --> 01:37:29.642
You're on the minute hand
of a clock.

01:37:29.684 --> 01:37:33.229
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

01:37:33.313 --> 01:37:36.274
Wait a minute.
l don't remember her.

01:37:51.497 --> 01:37:52.874
One more.

01:38:08.097 --> 01:38:09.265
One more.

01:38:38.419 --> 01:38:40.421
How disappointing.

01:38:43.132 --> 01:38:44.634
One more.

01:38:56.479 --> 01:38:58.857
You killed my friend.

01:39:04.904 --> 01:39:06.447
You killed my father!

01:39:26.217 --> 01:39:28.303
Roy!

01:39:28.386 --> 01:39:30.805
l thought you were dead!
Oh!

01:39:30.889 --> 01:39:33.391
You think
some tea-drinking psycho

01:39:33.433 --> 01:39:35.435
can take out Roy O'Bannon?

01:39:48.114 --> 01:39:50.116
Easy there, cowboy.

01:40:12.472 --> 01:40:14.015
You got any ideas?

01:40:19.062 --> 01:40:21.189
-We jump!
-Jump?!

01:40:22.732 --> 01:40:24.108
You mean fall?!

01:40:24.192 --> 01:40:25.944
Aim for the flag!

01:40:25.985 --> 01:40:27.612
Aw, shit.

01:40:28.905 --> 01:40:30.615
l got to tell you something.

01:40:30.698 --> 01:40:31.783
What?

01:40:31.824 --> 01:40:34.744
You're the best sidekick
l could ever ask for.

01:40:34.827 --> 01:40:37.997
Thank you, Roy.
l feel the same about you.

01:40:39.332 --> 01:40:40.583
On three.

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:41.793
One...

01:40:41.876 --> 01:40:43.253
Two...

01:40:43.336 --> 01:40:44.045
-Three!
-Three!

01:41:10.989 --> 01:41:12.407
Roy. Roy!

01:41:15.994 --> 01:41:17.495
Howdy.

01:41:21.624 --> 01:41:24.252
ln recognition
of outstanding bravery,

01:41:24.335 --> 01:41:27.505
l dub you Sir Chon Wang.

01:41:33.011 --> 01:41:34.929
For uncommon valor,

01:41:35.013 --> 01:41:38.433
l dub you Sir Roy O'Bannon.

01:41:43.855 --> 01:41:47.609
And for steadfast dedication
to justice,

01:41:47.692 --> 01:41:50.904
l dub you
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

01:41:56.201 --> 01:41:57.994
Arise.

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:15.136
Who loves you, baby?

01:42:31.069 --> 01:42:33.238
Madam.

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:38.701
Artie, l bet Scotland Yard's
dying to get you back now.

01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:40.954
My official
crime-fighting days are over.

01:42:41.037 --> 01:42:42.163
The queen has asked me

01:42:42.247 --> 01:42:44.541
to accompany the lmperial Seal
back to China.

01:42:44.624 --> 01:42:46.042
What a week.
Unbelievable.

01:42:46.125 --> 01:42:48.044
She couldn't have picked
a better man, right, Chon?

01:42:48.127 --> 01:42:49.170
Yeah.

01:42:49.254 --> 01:42:52.257
And the voyage is gonna give me
time to work on my new novel.

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:54.551
lt features a new kind
of detective,

01:42:54.634 --> 01:42:57.595
and he's gonna solve crimes
using deductive reasoning.

01:42:57.679 --> 01:42:59.264
Give me a name.
What's his name?

01:42:59.305 --> 01:43:00.807
Actually, Roy,
l was rather hoping

01:43:00.890 --> 01:43:03.560
to call him Sherlock Holmes,
if that's all right with you.

01:43:05.562 --> 01:43:07.647
l'd be insulted
if you didn't use it.

01:43:13.903 --> 01:43:15.822
-Ta.
-See you, Artie.

01:43:17.824 --> 01:43:20.159
That was very nice
of you, Roy.

01:43:20.201 --> 01:43:22.495
l would've kept the name
if l thought it was any good.

01:43:22.579 --> 01:43:24.163
lt's a horrible name
for a detective --

01:43:24.247 --> 01:43:26.416
Sherlock Holmes. Holmes?

01:43:28.042 --> 01:43:29.836
Will you stop playing with that?
l'm gonna smash it.

01:43:29.919 --> 01:43:31.171
l just want to see it
for a second.

01:43:31.212 --> 01:43:33.256
-Just let me see it.
-No, you're gonna break it.

01:43:34.924 --> 01:43:37.343
lt's just a rock
with some gibberish on it.

01:43:37.427 --> 01:43:38.928
That's Chinese.

01:43:39.804 --> 01:43:42.849
"Family is forever, my son.

01:43:42.932 --> 01:43:45.768
l'm proud
you cast your own stone."

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.731
That's a good message.

01:43:56.738 --> 01:43:59.949
l'd like to cast
my own stone, Chon.

01:44:06.664 --> 01:44:08.583
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:44:13.713 --> 01:44:16.883
l told you -- the house
of O'Bannon will prevail.

01:44:22.764 --> 01:44:24.933
Chon, l got a business
proposition for you.

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:26.893
No more zeppelins.

01:44:26.935 --> 01:44:28.728
No, no, this is much better
than zeppelins --

01:44:28.811 --> 01:44:30.647
a new thing they're starting
out in California

01:44:30.730 --> 01:44:32.148
called moving pictures.

01:44:32.232 --> 01:44:33.233
Pass.

01:44:33.274 --> 01:44:34.859
Hold it. Hold it.
Hear me out.

01:44:34.943 --> 01:44:37.278
l really think these movies
could play to your strength.

01:44:37.362 --> 01:44:38.279
There's no sound,

01:44:38.363 --> 01:44:40.448
so we don't have to worry
about the language problem.

01:44:40.532 --> 01:44:44.285
And l think the kung fu stuff
could be huge.

01:44:44.369 --> 01:44:46.538
People are dying
for a good action picture.

01:44:46.621 --> 01:44:48.206
What do you think?

01:44:48.289 --> 01:44:51.209
Chon Wang, movie star?

01:44:51.292 --> 01:44:52.710
lt could work.

01:44:52.752 --> 01:44:56.047
l feel bad about ditching
that Chaplin kid,

01:44:56.130 --> 01:44:58.466
but we're gonna be running
and gunning in Hollywood,

01:44:58.591 --> 01:45:01.010
and he'd just cramp our style.

01:45:01.052 --> 01:45:03.221
lt's such a tough town.

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:21.698
Bloody tourists!

01:45:21.865 --> 01:45:23.283
Action!

01:45:40.425 --> 01:45:41.759
You have to say "cut."

01:45:43.094 --> 01:45:45.180
You just keep looking!

01:45:52.478 --> 01:45:55.064
Come here, you little minx.

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:56.357
Cut.

01:45:56.441 --> 01:45:57.859
That was good.

01:45:57.984 --> 01:45:59.611
That was a good one, huh?

01:46:01.029 --> 01:46:04.616
Maybe on this one
l should lick you...you think?

01:46:04.699 --> 01:46:07.785
Like, after you lick me --
that could be kind of good.

01:46:07.869 --> 01:46:09.662
And, Jackie...

01:46:09.704 --> 01:46:10.830
Jackie?

01:46:10.914 --> 01:46:12.790
Thank you. Hi, Owen.

01:46:12.832 --> 01:46:14.000
Hello. How are you?

01:46:14.042 --> 01:46:16.503
Okay, and l'm not
Roy O'Bannon.

01:46:16.544 --> 01:46:17.670
Who are you?

01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:21.132
Damn it, Chon,
l think she's the one.

01:46:21.216 --> 01:46:23.843
l know it's crazy.
We just met, but she's the one.

01:46:23.885 --> 01:46:26.721
No, Roy,
she's my babysitter.

01:46:28.890 --> 01:46:30.475
Your babys--

01:46:30.558 --> 01:46:32.143
What?

01:46:32.227 --> 01:46:33.686
Baby what?

01:46:33.728 --> 01:46:34.896
Baby sister.

01:46:34.979 --> 01:46:36.523
Baby sister?

01:46:36.564 --> 01:46:38.858
Not babysitter.
Baby sister.

01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:52.664
You okay?

01:46:54.374 --> 01:46:55.333
Action!

01:46:58.253 --> 01:46:59.796
What happened?

01:46:59.879 --> 01:47:02.507
Roy is the type of a friend
you never introduce

01:47:02.590 --> 01:47:05.301
to your other friends
or bring into your family.

01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:08.972
He's -- Look at his eyes.
They're brown -- full of shit.

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:10.807
Always...

01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:12.809
Just bullshit all the time.

01:47:12.892 --> 01:47:14.435
Yeah, have you ever heard
of those?

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:16.980
They're parents.
We have parents that love us.

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:19.482
You don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

01:47:21.401 --> 01:47:24.487
You don't --
We've got par-- Yeah, parents.

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:26.990
Have you ever heard of those?
We've got parents that love us.

01:47:27.073 --> 01:47:29.826
But you don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

01:47:31.077 --> 01:47:32.954
Oh, go on.

01:47:33.913 --> 01:47:36.374
So mean.

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:39.669
Chon Wang, movie star?

01:47:39.752 --> 01:47:41.004
lt could work.

01:47:41.087 --> 01:47:43.840
lt could work.
You could do your own stunts.

01:47:43.923 --> 01:47:45.675
What? My own stunts?

01:47:51.764 --> 01:47:53.433
Whoa! Whoa!

01:47:54.434 --> 01:47:58.188
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.192
That hurt.

01:48:18.875 --> 01:48:21.044
You're supposed to catch me!

01:48:21.127 --> 01:48:22.253
Roy, catch.

01:48:29.552 --> 01:48:31.721
-Jesus.
-That's my fault.

01:48:31.804 --> 01:48:33.181
Wait a second.

01:48:33.264 --> 01:48:35.683
This nut is killing
your street women?

01:48:39.771 --> 01:48:41.856
Who did that?

01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:42.941
Jackie Chan.

01:48:42.982 --> 01:48:43.983
Me?

01:48:44.067 --> 01:48:45.318
That's right.

01:48:46.569 --> 01:48:48.738
-That was the...
-First time.

01:48:48.821 --> 01:48:50.740
-The best take.
-l'm sorry.

01:48:50.823 --> 01:48:52.116
Hurry up!

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.826
Are you crazy?!
l can't do that!

01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:56.371
This isn't Chinatown!
l can't sail through the air!

01:48:56.412 --> 01:48:58.373
-l'm not gonna break my neck!
-Roy!

01:48:58.456 --> 01:48:59.707
What in our history together

01:48:59.749 --> 01:49:02.293
makes you think l'm capable
of something like that?

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:03.294
lt's getting bigger!

01:49:03.336 --> 01:49:04.462
There's got to be
a better way.

01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:05.338
Roy!

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.882
Roy!
