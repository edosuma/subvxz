00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Good evening, Sergeant. 

00:53.001 --> 00:55.370
Good evening, Dr. Hassler. 

00:56.800 --> 00:58.810
File 7842. 

00:58.820 --> 01:00.880
Authority, please. 

01:01.340 --> 01:04.709
Thank you. 

01:20.340 --> 01:22.890
Your pen, Dr. Hassler. 

01:26.670 --> 01:28.820
Sorry, Sergeant. 

01:29.850 --> 01:31.880
Oh, well, now my plan is ruined. 

01:32.190 --> 01:36.000
See, it is not a pen at all, 
it is a secret camera. 

01:36.130 --> 01:38.670
A better luck next time, Doctor. 

01:52.260 --> 01:54.330
Vault nine. 

02:01.640 --> 02:03.980
Thank you, Sergeant. 

02:23.000 --> 02:26.390
Now, we shall see.

My mistake. You were right. 

02:56.670 --> 02:59.960

- ThatТs all right, doctor.

You didnТt won yet. 

07:56.501 --> 07:58.510

He's only got a hundred yards to walk.

Security, Lisa. 

08:28.270 --> 08:30.460
Scrambling's operative. 

08:37.690 --> 08:40.360
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. 

08:40.700 --> 08:42.700
The 67-th meeting 

08:42.700 --> 08:46.830
of the European Space Exploration 
Counsel is now in session. 

08:46.990 --> 08:50.920
This is a momentous occasion 
for our organization. 

08:51.250 --> 08:54.700
Sun Probe 1 was an unqualified success. 

08:54.760 --> 08:57.850
We have some spectacular results. 

08:57.940 --> 09:01.940
However, this meeting is colled 
considering one single result, 

09:01.970 --> 09:04.250
startling in its implications. 

09:04.560 --> 09:08.940
Dr. John Kane, the project Director. 

09:10.300 --> 09:14.680
Gentlemen, an unmanned 
satellite is naturally limited 

09:14.790 --> 09:16.870
in the transmission of information. 

09:17.040 --> 09:19.500
Part of the Sun Probe's equipment 
was a cine camera, 

09:19.510 --> 09:22.460
set to take one picture a minute 
for the duration of the flight. 

09:23.900 --> 09:25.700
Roll the film, please. 

09:28.500 --> 09:30.500
The far side of the Sun, 

09:30.501 --> 09:33.050
over 100 million miles from Earth, 

09:33.060 --> 09:37.850
hidden from the eyes of 
radiotelescopes by the Sun itself. 

09:37.860 --> 09:40.680
Now, at this point of the flight 
a strange thing happened. 

09:40.800 --> 09:42.000
The gyro mechanisms aboard 

09:42.010 --> 09:44.830
were influenced by another magnetic field 

09:44.840 --> 09:47.700
and the capsule slowly started to rotate. 

09:47.770 --> 09:50.500
Now, if you watch 
your screens carefully, 

09:50.600 --> 09:53.890
you will see, that the capsuleТs sunny 
camera was panned of the Sun 

09:53.895 --> 09:57.050
to watch the force, that was attracting it. 

09:59.420 --> 10:03.990
That force, gentlemen, was the 
gravitational pull of another planet. 

10:05.330 --> 10:07.630
Now I am going to hold 
the film here to show you 

10:07.631 --> 10:10.510
the first complete photographic 
evidende for the new planet. 

10:12.590 --> 10:14.700
Hold and zoom. 

10:16.020 --> 10:18.720
A new planet in our Solar system. 

10:22.150 --> 10:24.160
Thank you. 

10:24.170 --> 10:26.699
Photographic evidence is 
only part of the story. 

10:26.700 --> 10:32.830
Instruments aboard capsule report, 
that it is in the same orbit, as Earth, 

10:32.870 --> 10:35.790
but directly on the 
opposite side of the Sun. 

10:36.140 --> 10:39.720
Orbital speed, precisely 
the same as ours, 

10:39.730 --> 10:41.700
is the reason, that 
it remained undetected. 

10:41.710 --> 10:44.630
What information do we have 
from the other systems on board? 

10:44.750 --> 10:46.930
Not enough. 

10:46.940 --> 10:49.999
Which brings  me to the 
purpose of this meeting. 

10:50.120 --> 10:52.320
A proposal from the Chair, 

10:52.380 --> 10:55.500
that we should mount a manned 
flight to the new planet. 

10:55.510 --> 10:59.049
Lisa, book me a scrambled satellite 
call to the NASA Headquarter 

10:59.050 --> 11:01.080
at the end of this meeting, please. 

11:01.090 --> 11:04.090
- It is allready in hand, David. 
- How come? 

11:04.091 --> 11:06.200
Instructions from Jason Webb. 

11:06.210 --> 11:08.000
Oh. Thanks. 

11:08.330 --> 11:12.570
Now, Jason, how much is it 
going to cost us this time? 

11:14.310 --> 11:16.750
A point of order, Mr. Chairman. 

11:16.820 --> 11:18.820
Another one? 

11:18.850 --> 11:21.240
Mr. Chairman will agree, will he not, 

11:21.250 --> 11:24.500
that all delegates are entitled 
to share the EUROSEC information. 

11:24.530 --> 11:26.540
Correct!

11:26.550 --> 11:28.550
Then, perhaps, the Chairman 
will share with us 

11:28.560 --> 11:31.580
the estimative costs of 
this manned expedition.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.690
A realistic estimate, Gentlemen, 

11:39.800 --> 11:44.390
3 thousand million pounds sterling. 

11:46.500 --> 11:51.360
Mr. Chairman, I am sure, I am speaking 
for the whole of the community, 

11:51.390 --> 11:55.140
when I say, that such a sum 
is out of the question. 

11:55.390 --> 11:58.640
Trust a German to louse it up! 

11:58.750 --> 12:02.100
They lecture us on 
penny-pinching economics. 

12:02.390 --> 12:05.910
The French are only too glad 
to agree with  them. 

12:05.920 --> 12:10.680
The rest of the Comunity goes 
wichever way the wind blows. 

12:10.690 --> 12:12.740
America is our only hope. 

12:12.800 --> 12:17.630
- If they contribute, the rest might follow. 
- Oh, face it, Jason, we've had it. 

12:17.640 --> 12:19.030
Had what? 

12:19.040 --> 12:21.160
This is only a temporary setback. 

12:21.161 --> 12:23.161
Did you see the the PoulsonТs face, 
when you pitched the price? 

12:23.310 --> 12:25.620
- No, I didnТt. 
- Well I did, and he's not gonna buy it. 

12:25.630 --> 12:29.330
- He'll buy it! 
- Oh, for GodТs sake! 

12:31.480 --> 12:34.320
- Yes? 
- David Poulson on the internal. 

12:34.330 --> 12:36.800
Are you free to see him? 

12:37.300 --> 12:39.320
- Send him right up. 
- Yes, sir. 

12:39.380 --> 12:44.920
You're gonna sit there and watch 
me take command for 1 billion dollars. 

12:45.240 --> 12:47.980
The words of an egocentrical megalomaniac. 

12:48.300 --> 12:50.900
Maniac? 

12:52.370 --> 12:58.690
Remind me to be as charitable to you, 
when one of your rockets blows up on the pad. 

12:59.020 --> 13:01.910
And you better attend that cardiac warning. 

13:03.500 --> 13:05.970
Just a  minute. 

13:06.010 --> 13:08.310
I will make a deal with you. 

13:10.870 --> 13:12.930
You stick to the science, 

13:13.350 --> 13:15.460
let me handle the politics. 

13:15.470 --> 13:17.500
I will accept that deal. 

13:17.510 --> 13:20.630
I will stick to the science, 
if you handle the politics. 

13:23.160 --> 13:25.320
Hello, John. 

13:26.090 --> 13:28.680
Hi, Jason. 

13:28.690 --> 13:30.710
How are you, David? 

13:30.720 --> 13:32.170
Some scotch? 

13:32.280 --> 13:34.300
Thanks. Hope you don't mind 
if I do. Straight. 

13:34.310 --> 13:36.310
All right. 

13:39.120 --> 13:42.170
Now, why don't you give 
it to me, straight? 

13:42.300 --> 13:47.500
Well, as you know, the United States 
has always cooperated with EUROSEC. 

13:47.501 --> 13:50.410
- But in this case we feel... 
- I said straight! 

13:51.170 --> 13:53.390
O'k, Jason, 

13:53.390 --> 13:55.430
It's "no go". 

13:56.900 --> 14:01.030
We discover a new planet 
in our own Solar system. 

14:01.370 --> 14:05.140
Military and scientific implications 
beyond comprehension. 

14:05.160 --> 14:07.170
We ask our friends... 

14:07.180 --> 14:09.180
...for a few dollars. 

14:09.190 --> 14:11.200
And it's "no go".

14:11.210 --> 14:13.319
One billion dollars, Jason. 

14:13.320 --> 14:15.330
Cheap at twice the price. 

14:18.830 --> 14:21.830
- Are you sure about this? 
- Yes. Give it to Jason tonight. 

14:23.090 --> 14:25.100
Delay could be dangerous. 

14:26.000 --> 14:28.010
Oh, no, thanks. 

14:28.020 --> 14:30.470
You wouldn't want anybody 
else get there first, could you? 

14:30.480 --> 14:33.790
But how could they? When we have 
sole access to the information. 

14:34.000 --> 14:36.080
Who else would know of 
the planet's existence? 

14:36.090 --> 14:39.090
You know perfectly well, 
that we have a security leak. 

14:39.100 --> 14:41.300
Well, we all have our problems. 

14:43.050 --> 14:45.390
I see. I get the message. 

14:45.420 --> 14:48.030
I know how you feel 
about this project, Jason. 

14:48.060 --> 14:50.080
But the answer ist "no". 

14:50.090 --> 14:52.170
I am sorry, I really am. 

14:52.380 --> 14:54.650
So am I. 

14:58.020 --> 15:00.110
Miss Kurby! 

15:09.120 --> 15:11.120
I am going home now. 

15:11.130 --> 15:14.130
Tell Newman and Lisa, 
I want to see them at 7:30. 

15:14.131 --> 15:16.131
Yes, Mr. Webb. 

15:16.132 --> 15:18.132
Oh, and... 

15:18.133 --> 15:21.150
John Kane asked me 
to give you this. 

15:36.080 --> 15:38.990
Sorry, Jason, but I am through. John.  

16:01.300 --> 16:03.430
Come in! 

16:07.870 --> 16:10.930
I want a run-down on the 
current security position. 

16:10.931 --> 16:12.620
- Deffensively? 
- H-m-m-m. 

16:12.630 --> 16:14.629
We haused all findings, 
computer programs 

16:14.630 --> 16:16.629
and visual data from 
Sun Probe 1 in Vault 2. 

16:16.630 --> 16:18.629
Access? 

16:18.630 --> 16:20.629
- Restricted! 
- To whom? 

16:20.630 --> 16:22.730
Yourself, John Kane and Mark. 

16:22.835 --> 16:24.840
And offensively? 

16:24.841 --> 16:27.850
I've already reported the near certainty 
of a security leak, especially... 

16:27.851 --> 16:29.960
And so? 

16:29.970 --> 16:32.240
We picked up a radio 
signal again this morning. 

16:32.290 --> 16:35.250
- I am gonna burry him. 
- Why not a fake? 

16:35.760 --> 16:37.200
Listen, Jason, that 
information is coded 

16:37.650 --> 16:39.720
and radioed out in 
a 2-seconds transmission. 

16:40.840 --> 16:43.560
And there are 86,400 seconds in a day. 

16:44.000 --> 16:47.990
All right. You made your point. 

16:48.620 --> 16:51.350
- But when are you gonna nail him? 
- What? 

16:51.570 --> 16:54.750
When are you going to nail him? 

16:55.650 --> 16:57.680
Depends on how much 
rope we'll give him. 

16:57.700 --> 16:59.950
All right. 

17:00.050 --> 17:03.369
Lisa, that access restriction 
must be widened. 

17:03.370 --> 17:05.369
To whom? 

17:05.371 --> 17:07.371
Hassler. 

17:07.372 --> 17:09.372
Dr. Hassler. 

17:09.373 --> 17:11.373
You are serving the 
information on a plate 

17:11.374 --> 17:13.374
to our prime suspect? 

17:13.375 --> 17:15.375
That is my responsibility. 

17:15.376 --> 17:18.376
Your responsibility is this: 

17:18.377 --> 17:22.140
If he shows his hand, 
I don't want an arrest. 

17:22.640 --> 17:24.660
Undestood? 

17:25.609 --> 17:27.970
Undestood. 

18:30.770 --> 18:32.770
Has any of this information 
been transmitted? 

18:32.771 --> 18:34.990
He certainly wasn't 
broadcasting record requests. 

18:35.000 --> 18:37.050
So by now, the existence of the new planet 

18:37.060 --> 18:39.060
could be known outside 
Europe and the States. 

18:39.070 --> 18:41.070
I am afraid so. 

18:41.071 --> 18:43.071
And preparation for a manned flight 

18:43.072 --> 18:45.072
should be under way 
by somebody else.

18:45.073 --> 18:48.074
Don't panic. 
It would take some time. 

18:48.075 --> 18:50.075
Yes, we have to check out 
your information,  

18:50.076 --> 18:52.076
to examine Hassler's body, 

18:52.076 --> 18:54.076
to see the transmissions 
you monitored, 

18:54.077 --> 18:56.317
to check the manufacturing origins 
of this photographic equipment. 

18:56.400 --> 18:59.990
Arrange all that for 
Mr. Poulson immediately. 

19:00.000 --> 19:02.160
And put John Kane in the picture. 

19:02.360 --> 19:04.360
Right. 

19:05.160 --> 19:07.490
Oh, can I have a look at 
the photographic equipment? 

19:07.620 --> 19:09.590
Sure. 

19:11.000 --> 19:13.060
Does our side have anything like this? 

19:13.061 --> 19:14.320
We have now. 

19:16.500 --> 19:18.500
Oh, Mark... 

19:18.510 --> 19:20.670
Give that back to Kane, will you? 

19:21.650 --> 19:24.840
Tell him... 
I accept his apologies. 

19:24.850 --> 19:26.870
Right. 

19:32.000 --> 19:34.390
So, you are convinced now 
there have been a leak. 

19:34.500 --> 19:37.520
Yes. And I am left with no choice. 

19:37.800 --> 19:39.800
I agree. 

19:39.801 --> 19:41.801
But itТll be up to you to persuade 
the rest of the Community. 

19:41.802 --> 19:45.510
But you be prepared to recommend, 
that the United States 

19:45.520 --> 19:50.960
should contribute 1 billion dollars to a 
manned flight conducted by EUROSEC. 

19:51.000 --> 19:54.660
Yes. Full information share. 

19:54.670 --> 19:56.670
Guaranteed. 

19:56.671 --> 19:58.671
By you? 

19:58.672 --> 20:00.672
What else do you suggest? 

20:00.673 --> 20:02.673
Putting an American 
astronaut on the team. 

20:02.674 --> 20:04.674
Who? 

20:04.675 --> 20:06.675
I have already called Cape Kennedy. 

20:06.676 --> 20:08.676
They've come up with 
our most experienced. 

20:08.677 --> 20:10.677
50 days of space flight, 

20:10.678 --> 20:12.678
2 manned projects to Mars... 

20:12.700 --> 20:15.140
Glenn Ross? 

20:25.370 --> 20:30.670
<i> The passengers from NASA flight 155 
will arrive at Gate seven. </i> 

20:30.700 --> 20:32.790
<i> Thank you. </i> 

21:12.060 --> 21:14.330
Hold it, Mrs Ross! 

21:14.500 --> 21:16.670
Thank you, Colonel. 

21:19.000 --> 21:21.330
I am Jason Webb. 
Welcome to EUROSEC! 

21:21.331 --> 21:23.331
Glenn Ross. 
My wife Sharon. 

21:23.332 --> 21:25.332
- How do you do? 
- Hello! 

21:25.333 --> 21:27.333
This is Lisa Hartman, security. 

21:27.334 --> 21:29.334
- How do you do? 
- Hello! 

21:29.335 --> 21:31.335
- Miss Hartman. 
- Nice to meet you. 

21:31.336 --> 21:33.336
- Dr. Kane, our Project Director. 
- How do you do? 

21:33.337 --> 21:35.337
- Delighted to meet you. 
- Me too. 

21:35.338 --> 21:37.338
Paulo Landi, public relations. 

21:37.339 --> 21:39.339
He will be lookng after both of you. 

21:39.340 --> 21:41.340
- How do you do, Missis Ross? 
- Hello! 

21:51.940 --> 21:55.770
- Would you like me to bring you a drink? 
- A scotch, please. 

22:12.840 --> 22:15.870
- WhatТs on your mind? 
- I have been thinking, John... 

22:16.360 --> 22:20.650
... about the second astronaut 
of Captain Ross. 

22:20.670 --> 22:22.690
Now, Baldwin is the obvious choice.  

22:22.700 --> 22:24.700
Or Mitchell... 

22:24.701 --> 22:27.000
If we want just 
an astronaut, I agree. 

22:27.001 --> 22:31.600
- But? 
- It occurs to me, that we need 
someone more flexible. 

22:31.610 --> 22:34.710
- But I trained them... 
- I mean in terms of knowledge. 

22:35.000 --> 22:37.320
Someone who could take full advantage 

22:37.321 --> 22:40.570
of any findings on the new planet. 

22:40.600 --> 22:43.950
However bizarre and unusual 
they happen to be. 

22:43.960 --> 22:46.670
You mean an astrophysicist? 

22:48.630 --> 22:50.690
Me? 

22:50.700 --> 22:52.700
Yeah. The idea doesnТt appeal to you? 

22:52.701 --> 22:56.770
- You must be joking. 
- 't'll grow on you. 

23:18.300 --> 23:20.720
Well, there she is. 

23:39.160 --> 23:41.380
Watch the gantry. 

23:42.500 --> 23:45.950
We have been developing a 
lift body for controlled landings. 

23:46.000 --> 23:48.960
If analysis confirms an 
atmosphere on the new planet, 

23:48.970 --> 23:51.630
we'll use that as a last stage. 

24:00.190 --> 24:03.230
Without seeming too eager, 
when does the training start? 

24:03.240 --> 24:05.390
Tomorrow. 

24:06.590 --> 24:08.780
I can hardly wait.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.150
400. 

24:54.160 --> 24:56.160
400. 

24:56.161 --> 24:58.161
450. 

24:58.162 --> 25:00.162
500. 

25:00.163 --> 25:02.163
600. 

25:02.164 --> 25:04.164
650. 

25:04.165 --> 25:05.165
700. 

25:05.166 --> 25:06.166
700. 

25:06.167 --> 25:08.167
- Fire retros! 
- Hold it! 

25:08.168 --> 25:10.168
- 750. 
- Jason! 

25:14.169 --> 25:16.169
800! 

25:16.410 --> 25:18.630
What are you trying to do? 
Kill him? 

25:22.030 --> 25:24.180
800! 

25:24.181 --> 25:26.181
- 850! 
- Now! 
- Retros! 

25:26.182 --> 25:28.590
No! 

25:32.070 --> 25:34.610
Are you o'k, John? 

25:34.620 --> 25:36.620
O'k. 

25:36.621 --> 25:38.621
Yes, I am o'k. 

26:03.150 --> 26:05.160
Hi! 

26:05.320 --> 26:07.350
I didnТt know you would be back. 

26:09.190 --> 26:12.360
- You are late. 
- We... 

26:12.400 --> 26:15.400
drove to Lisbon to see the Cathedral, 

26:15.410 --> 26:17.860
and then stopped over for dinner. 

26:18.400 --> 26:22.660
Oh, I could sleep for a week! 

26:49.580 --> 26:51.660
I had my first medical today. 

26:51.670 --> 26:54.870
Did you? 
How did it go? 

26:54.880 --> 26:57.330
The doctors say 
everythingТs alright, as usual. 

26:58.650 --> 27:00.670
Good. 

27:00.830 --> 27:02.890
<i> Everything </i> is all right. 

27:03.450 --> 27:06.450
We are not starting that one again, are we? 

27:06.570 --> 27:08.670
Look, face it, Glenn, it is your job. 

27:08.680 --> 27:11.690
You're up in space hundreds of days, 

27:11.710 --> 27:14.500
you are subjected to radiation effects 
and that is why we can't have children. 

27:14.510 --> 27:16.860
The doctors said differend. 

27:16.870 --> 27:18.910
They were employed by politicians. 

27:19.140 --> 27:22.540
Do you really think they'd 
tell you even the truth? 

27:23.980 --> 27:27.030
Great publicity. 

27:29.050 --> 27:33.640
AmericaТs top astronaut... sterile. 

27:37.320 --> 27:40.370
Your doctors donТt work for politicians, 
so we know it is not you. 

27:40.390 --> 27:44.970
For GodТs sake, I am not about 
to go trough this again! 

27:44.971 --> 27:47.990
The brutal truth of the matter 
is that you went up there a man, 

27:47.991 --> 27:50.500
but you came less than a man.  

27:58.110 --> 28:00.980
May be this is why we are 
not having kids, huh? 

28:05.700 --> 28:07.730
If you have anything to say, 
you better say it now. 

28:08.920 --> 28:11.390
It'so how you prove 
your virility? 

28:29.360 --> 28:32.750
It really was the only way 
of attracting your attention. 

28:33.370 --> 28:35.700
You look like a man with problems. 

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Yes, IТll tell you about them some day. 

28:38.170 --> 28:40.440
Thank you. 

28:40.700 --> 28:43.340
<i> Would Mister Edwards, 
please contact reception? </i> 

28:43.360 --> 28:45.660
We donТt often see you 
at the administration. 

28:45.670 --> 28:47.670
Jason wants to see me. 

28:47.690 --> 28:50.130
How is the training going? 

28:50.140 --> 28:53.190
ItТs tough enough for me, 
but itТs hard for John. 

28:53.200 --> 28:55.560
So itТs crash course 
of space preparation. 

28:55.750 --> 28:57.260
Glenn... 

28:57.270 --> 28:59.290
There is something 
I shouldnТt tell you. 

28:59.300 --> 29:01.300
WhatТs that?  

29:01.301 --> 29:03.301
- I know why Jason wants to see you. 
- Why? 

29:03.302 --> 29:05.302
He plans to put the 
launch date forward. 

29:05.310 --> 29:07.310
- Forward? 
- Hmm. 

29:08.010 --> 29:10.370
Well, weТll see about that. 

29:10.371 --> 29:12.471
Good luck, Glenn. 

29:12.500 --> 29:14.500
- Lisa... 
- Hmm? 

29:15.000 --> 29:17.950
Thanks for the warning. 

29:22.410 --> 29:25.170
I am forwarding the 
launching day four weeks. 

29:25.180 --> 29:27.140
You are pushing too hard, Jason. 

29:27.150 --> 29:29.320
You donТt understand. 

29:29.400 --> 29:31.460
In Germany budgetary troubles, 

29:31.470 --> 29:33.470
in France political troubles... 

29:33.500 --> 29:36.760
Someone is going to suggest 
withdrawing from the project, any day. 

29:36.770 --> 29:38.990
You are an administrator, you 
know when a rocket's ready, 

29:38.991 --> 29:41.210
but you donТt know when 
a man is ready. Kane isnТt. 

29:44.760 --> 29:48.050
I know more about human nature, 

29:48.060 --> 29:51.290
than anybody else at EUROSEC. 

29:51.640 --> 29:54.650
ThatТs why I am in this office. 

29:55.280 --> 29:57.350
And I am telling you, Kane will make it. 

29:57.360 --> 29:59.370
And I am telling you he wonТt. 

29:59.371 --> 30:01.371
Where do we go from here? 

30:01.372 --> 30:03.372
There are other American astronauts... 

30:03.373 --> 30:05.373
ThatТs right. 

30:05.374 --> 30:07.374
You'd be right back to zero again. 

30:08.320 --> 30:10.500
Nevertheless, 

30:10.510 --> 30:12.590
I am informing you officially, 

30:12.600 --> 30:15.600
that the launching day 
will be brought forward... 

30:16.000 --> 30:18.320
two weeks. 

30:21.990 --> 30:23.990
Two weeks. 

30:28.710 --> 30:30.710
Now? 

30:30.711 --> 30:32.711
Now. 

30:57.300 --> 30:59.300
My instincts tell me, there is 

30:59.301 --> 31:01.990
a little bit of transportation 
around here somewhere. 

31:02.000 --> 31:04.330
Don't the rule say we walk? 

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
Sure. 

31:18.380 --> 31:20.390
What is it like up there? 

31:20.391 --> 31:22.940
- Where? 
- There. 

31:23.070 --> 31:25.100
Lonely. 

31:25.310 --> 31:27.450
How lonely? 

31:27.460 --> 31:30.320
Same as down here, no difference. 

31:30.630 --> 31:35.690
You mean, you have got someone 
with you down here, up there? 

31:35.700 --> 31:37.700
Yes. It has to be the right person. 

31:37.710 --> 31:39.710
Otherways makes no difference. 

31:39.720 --> 31:41.720
No difference. 

31:47.500 --> 31:50.100
- Home again. 
- Yeah. 

31:50.101 --> 31:52.101
This is the part we have 
to make look good, 

31:52.102 --> 31:54.110
we are back uncomfortably early. 

32:09.320 --> 32:11.340
I could grow attached to them. 

32:11.350 --> 32:13.400
That's the idea. 

32:13.710 --> 32:16.990
Now you could be hooked up to the heart, 
lung and kidney machine during the flight. 

32:17.000 --> 32:19.260
With sedation, 

32:19.300 --> 32:21.350
you will sleep... 

32:21.690 --> 32:23.690
for tree weeks there... 

32:23.960 --> 32:26.210
and tree weeks back. 

32:26.530 --> 32:28.960
That part I'm looking forward to.

38:47.301 --> 38:49.301
<i> Roger. Stand by. </i> 

39:01.320 --> 39:03.390
Remove fuel injectors. 

39:03.391 --> 39:05.391
Roger. 

39:12.000 --> 39:16.630
- Control, have X-ray Bravo keep us 
informed about that weather front. 
<i> - Check. </i> 

39:16.631 --> 39:18.631
Cabin pressure seems 
a little bit low. 

39:18.632 --> 39:20.632
<i> It's been checked right now. </i> 

39:20.633 --> 39:22.633
Medical 1 to Flight control. 

39:22.634 --> 39:24.634
Colonel Ross: 
pulse: 74, 

39:24.634 --> 39:26.634
blood pressure normal. 

39:26.634 --> 39:28.634
Respiration normal. 

39:30.960 --> 39:32.960
Medical 2 to Flight control. 

39:32.970 --> 39:35.970
Dr. Kane, pulse 110, 

39:36.380 --> 39:39.670
Blood pressure raised 150 over 100, 

39:39.680 --> 39:41.980
respiration: normal. 

39:42.500 --> 39:44.500
Phoenix, 

39:44.501 --> 39:46.950
<i> - switch to internal. </i> 
- Roger, internal. 

39:46.960 --> 39:49.000
Remove umbilical! 

39:59.510 --> 40:02.110
Lift-off: minus 2 minutes. 

40:02.120 --> 40:04.120
<i> Stages check. 
Command done, internal? </i> 

40:04.121 --> 40:06.121
<i> Affirmative. </i> 

40:06.123 --> 40:08.123
<i> - Telemetry in launch condition? 
- Affirmative. </i> 

40:08.124 --> 40:10.124
<i> - Missile on internal D.C. (Display Console)? 
- Affirmative. </i> 

40:10.125 --> 40:12.125
<i> - Pressurization complete? 
- Affirmative. </i> 

40:12.130 --> 40:14.300
<i> I have a check-complete light. </i> 

40:14.320 --> 40:16.620
<i> Lock tanking secured. </i> 

40:16.630 --> 40:20.030
This is EUROSEC Launch control, 
ignition sequence commences. 

40:20.031 --> 40:22.600
<i> T (Time), minus 27 
seconds and counting. </i> 

40:22.601 --> 40:26.601
<i> All recorders and oscillographs 
to fast vario start. </i> 

40:26.602 --> 40:28.602
<i> - This is Computer control... 
- Lock water is pressurized. </i> 

40:31.070 --> 40:34.100
Ten seconds, nine, eight... 

40:34.101 --> 40:36.101
seven, six... 

40:36.102 --> 40:38.102
five, four... 

40:38.103 --> 40:40.398
tree, two, one... 

40:40.399 --> 40:42.600
Igniзгo! 

40:44.120 --> 40:46.140
Flight control, this is Phoenix. 

40:46.320 --> 40:49.520
We have ignition, 
I say again, we have ignition. 

40:50.030 --> 40:52.070
All systems go. 

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
Lift-off. 

42:14.380 --> 42:16.780
Well, she flies. 

42:16.790 --> 42:18.990
Off cource she bloody well flies! 

42:40.190 --> 42:42.390
You can see how they imagined at 
that time the dream of the medicals - 

42:42.400 --> 42:46.790
a direct continuous venous 
approach for infusions. 

42:46.800 --> 42:49.590
Nowadays there are already avaiable 
implantable port-a-cath systems 

42:49.600 --> 42:51.990
for chemotherapy and infusions 
for oncological and other patients.

43:43.850 --> 43:45.850
See you in three weeks. 

43:45.851 --> 43:47.950
Let us hope the alarm clock goes off. 

43:47.960 --> 43:51.380
Better. You made it. 

47:06.600 --> 47:08.960
Good morning. 

47:59.300 --> 48:01.680
Bang on target. 

48:02.010 --> 48:04.010
Clouds. 

48:04.011 --> 48:06.011
There are clouds, Glenn! 

48:06.012 --> 48:08.012
So, there is an atmosphere. 

48:08.150 --> 48:13.510
All right. Preliminary orbit: 34 thousand miles 
from the planet's surface's plane, right? 

48:13.511 --> 48:15.511
Right. 

48:15.850 --> 48:18.100
O'k, two orbits to mark out 

48:18.101 --> 48:20.101
electronic survey 

48:20.102 --> 48:22.102
and we decide... 

48:22.110 --> 48:24.110
To land or not to land?  

49:16.740 --> 49:18.850
Well, let's have it. 

49:18.851 --> 49:20.851
Mass and gravitational pull: 

49:20.852 --> 49:22.852
similar to Earth, 

49:22.853 --> 49:24.853
there is an atmosphere, 

49:24.854 --> 49:26.854
oxygen present. 

49:26.855 --> 49:28.855
Suitable landing site? 

49:28.856 --> 49:30.856
Established. 

49:30.857 --> 49:32.857
Seascape 

49:32.858 --> 49:34.858
and vegetation, 

49:34.859 --> 49:36.859
so far no sign of life. 

49:36.860 --> 49:37.860
All right, mate. 

49:37.861 --> 49:39.861
What's the next move? 

49:41.100 --> 49:43.340
Well, like you said: 
to land or not to land. 

49:44.300 --> 49:46.999
Well, this is one we can't 
put through the computer. 

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
What do you think? 

49:49.100 --> 49:51.690
I think, on the result of the survay, 
we donТt have a choice. 

49:51.700 --> 49:53.999
- You? 
- I am for go. 

49:54.040 --> 49:56.310
LetТs go, then. 

49:57.110 --> 49:59.870
Landing orbit, coming up. 

50:25.090 --> 50:29.630
EXPLOSIVES 

50:33.380 --> 50:35.640
<i> Cabin pressure: zero. </i> 

50:35.650 --> 50:38.650
<i> Ready for transfer to 
the landing lift body. </i> 

53:43.090 --> 53:45.950
<i> - 30 seconds. 
- O'k. </i> 

53:49.290 --> 53:53.990
<i> The on board computer should take us 
within 5 miles from the selected landing site. </i> 

53:54.680 --> 53:56.680
<i> - 10 seconds. 
- Right. </i> 

53:56.690 --> 53:59.000
<i> If we have any trouble with the guiding 
system, give me manual straight away. </i> 

53:59.001 --> 54:01.003
<i> Check. </i> 

54:01.004 --> 54:03.100
<i> There we go. </i> 

55:04.180 --> 55:07.770
<i> Computer checks, 
main retros: 5 seconds. </i> 

55:07.771 --> 55:09.771
<i> Roger. </i> 

55:09.772 --> 55:12.772
<i> Tree, two, one... </i> 

55:27.310 --> 55:29.590
<i> Time check? </i> 

55:30.660 --> 55:34.600
<i> Three minutes to manual, 
four minutes to touch-down. </i> 

55:39.100 --> 55:41.640
<i> Manual! </i> 

55:43.010 --> 55:45.500
<i> Give me manual! </i> 

55:51.330 --> 55:53.760
<i> Landing lights. </i> 

56:01.520 --> 56:04.910
<i> Vertical jets, full flaps. </i> 

59:51.010 --> 59:53.510
Do you speak English? 

59:53.520 --> 59:55.760
I am Air-Sea Rescue. 

59:55.770 --> 59:57.840
Ulan Bator. 

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:02.780
I will get your friend. 

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.670
- Well? 
- The results of the electronic medical check... 

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.550
He is in a pretty good shape. 

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.470
But the readouts of the items 
20, 27 and 32 donТt make sense. 

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480
They certainly don't. 

01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:37.481
- Check the computer. 
- It was checked out this morning. 

01:01:37.482 --> 01:01:39.482
Then check it out again! 

01:01:39.703 --> 01:01:41.780
Never trust them. 

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.720
- Any improvement? 
- No. 

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:54.990
Has he spoken? 

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Desjointedly. 

01:01:57.001 --> 01:01:59.001
It's impossible to make out a meaning. 

01:01:59.002 --> 01:02:01.790
Arrange for everything 
he says to be recorded. 

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.900
Mark, 

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.980
I want a total security black-out 
on news of their return. 

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.960
Till we find out what 
the devil has gone wrong! 

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.310
What about that 
Mongolian rescue team? 

01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:14.809
I have already called 
my opposite number 

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.610
in the Soviet Academy of Space Science. 
They agreed to cooperate. 

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.620
Does the clamp-down 
include Missis Ross? 

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.690
No, tell her to stand by. 

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:26.860
Pontini! 

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:30.920
No one, except authorized personel, 
has to see any of the results, 

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:33.000
till all of the computers have 
been completely rechecked. 

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.100
You are responsible. 

01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:37.170
It's my department. 

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.270
Well? 

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.960
- Dr. Kane is still unconscious... 
- And Colonel Ross? 

01:02:46.961 --> 01:02:48.961
Apart of the shock and 
the surperficial burning, 

01:02:48.962 --> 01:02:50.962
- located in... 
- Is he fit? 

01:02:50.963 --> 01:02:52.963
I donТt want details. 

01:02:52.964 --> 01:02:54.964
I want to know one thing: 

01:02:54.965 --> 01:02:57.965
- Is he fit questioning? 
- Yes. 

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.350
Do I have to go through with this? 

01:03:24.351 --> 01:03:26.370
ItТs your job. 

01:03:38.099 --> 01:03:40.099
Before we get started, 

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.600
this is an interrogation room, 
not a debriefing center. 

01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:45.960
ThatТs right. Sit down, please. 

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:57.410
Why did you turn back? 

01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:59.650
We did not turn back. 

01:03:59.651 --> 01:04:02.360
You continue to claim that 
you completed your mission? 

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840
We reached the new planet. Yes. 

01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:07.960
You agree that the flight to the planet 
and return is a journey of six weeks?  

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:12.390
- Yes. 
- You accept that you have in fact returned 
three weeks after launching? 

01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:14.400
All right, I... canТt exlplain that. 

01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:16.401
What I can say is that... 

01:04:16.402 --> 01:04:18.402
You completed the electronic survey? 

01:04:18.403 --> 01:04:20.403
Yes. 

01:04:20.404 --> 01:04:22.404
On the new planet? 

01:04:22.405 --> 01:04:24.405
- Yes. 
- And returned to Earth? 

01:04:24.406 --> 01:04:26.406
We crashed! 

01:04:26.407 --> 01:04:28.407
On Earth!? 

01:04:28.408 --> 01:04:30.408
On the planet! 

01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:32.500
You are here... 
...<i> on Earth! </i> 

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.501
To the planet and back in three weeks? 

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:38.180
I donТt know. There 
is a lot I canТt explain. 

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:41.190
You left Earth. Three 
weeks later you returned. 

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.360
Crashed. 

01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:46.270
It takes six weeks to travel 
to the new planet and return. 

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.560
You were gone three weeks. 

01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:50.570
So, you turned back! 

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.580
- We did not turned back! 
- Why? 

01:04:52.581 --> 01:04:53.581
Why? 

01:04:53.582 --> 01:04:55.582
WHY? 

01:04:55.583 --> 01:04:58.583
I am sending Ross home. You won't 
get any more out of him today. 

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.100
The interrogation leaves 
us with two possibilities: 

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.270
One: 

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.080
Ross aborted the mission and turned back. 

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:10.160
If that was the case, 
he would deny for obvious reasons. 

01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.470
Two: 

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.830
Ross genuinely believes he made 
the journey to the new planet. 

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.670
And he is as surprised as we are, 

01:05:18.671 --> 01:05:21.440
that when he landed, he 
found himself back on Earth. 

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.980
This is the theory I prefer to believe. 

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.110
Only one snag:  

01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:32.998
Why was there Уno sign of lifeФ 
on his electronic survey? 

01:05:33.699 --> 01:05:35.700
But that could be explained. 

01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:39.360
The orbit took them over the Pacific, 
the Atlantic and the Poles. 

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:41.598
The few land masses they crossed 
are mainly uninhabited. 

01:05:41.599 --> 01:05:43.599
All right. 

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.600
So we prefer the second theory. 

01:05:45.601 --> 01:05:47.601
But...three weeks to the planet... 

01:05:47.602 --> 01:05:50.310
three weeks back, 
that's six weeks in all. 

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.970
- They were only away three weeks. 
- That's right. 

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:55.970
So...they turned back. 

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.980
It still doesn't make sense. 

01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:00.990
The world's most experienced astronaut... 

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.340
and the leading scientist... 
Why? 

01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:09.960
The Council felt railroaded 
into this project from the start. 

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:12.460
They'll turn like a pack of wolves, 
when they know that it has failed. 

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.470
They don't know yet. 

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.530
And they won't know, until I 
establish exactly what happened. 

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.570
You can't do that without 
the flight recorder. 

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.800
And itТs still on the Phoenix. 

01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:23.260
Arrangements must be 
made to bring that back. 

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:25.700
When is Poulson due back from the States? 

01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:27.710
Not till the 17th. 

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.710
Thank God for that! 

01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:39.070
Was it rough? 

01:06:39.071 --> 01:06:41.090
Yeah. 

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.800
Glenn, what really happened? 

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.170
What do you mean? 

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.520
What made you turn back? 

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.880
We didnТt turn back. 

01:06:50.890 --> 01:06:53.060
Then it doesnТt make sense. 

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.740
Right. 

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:01.990
You are covering for 
John Kane, arenТt you? 

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.930
No. There ist nothing to cover for. 

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:07.680
Look out! 

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.590
What the hell are you doing? 

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.650
He was on the wrong side of the road. 

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.920
It must have been rough. 

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.570
IТll go make some coffee. 

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.190
Sharon, whatТs going on? 

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:14.350
Sharon! 

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.359
- What is it, Glenn? 
- You know damn well what it is. This rom. 

01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:19.810
- What about the room? 
- ItТs changed! Everything is changed! 

01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:21.840
What the hell's happened here? 

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.939
Well, some desorientation isn't unusual, 

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:43.960
after a protracted period in space. 

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.979
I undersand that, but it has never 
happened after the previous space flights. 

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.080
All right. Keep me informed. 

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.380
If the things get worse, 
I promise immediate action. 

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.600
Fresh Appeal 
Cologne 

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.340
What is it? 

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.150
What's wrong? 

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160
The wrighting is reversed. 

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.190
Everything is reversed! 

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.890
Jason Webb, please. 

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:42.330
Jason, this is urgent. I 
must see you right away. 

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:46.150
Excuse me, Colonel. 

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.770
- Yeah, what is it? 
- Over here, Colonel! 

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.030
What the hell is this all about? 

01:10:50.031 --> 01:10:52.320
Do what they say, Glenn. 

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.970
- He called me.
- From where? 

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.300
From the bathroom in here. 

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:28.980
See for yourself. 

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:31.950
He shouldnТt have been send home. 

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.360
He could have killed me. 

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.830
This does it. 
I am getting out of here. 

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.890
You donТt mean that, Sharon! 

01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:42.891
You bet I do. 

01:11:42.892 --> 01:11:44.892
What happened after he 
smashed off the bottles? 

01:11:44.893 --> 01:11:47.100
He went crazy. He sayd his own 
handwrighting was reversed, my watch ...  

01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:49.150
...everything. 

01:11:49.151 --> 01:11:52.060
Look at this. Does this 
look reversed to you? 

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.760
This man has gone out of his mind. 

01:11:58.761 --> 01:12:01.140
We donТt know that yet. 

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.150
Well, you may not, but I do. 

01:12:03.151 --> 01:12:05.151
I am his wife, remember that. 

01:12:05.152 --> 01:12:07.152
He has been violent before. 

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.500
Like this? 

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.520
He hit me. 

01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:13.599
- It was that flight. 
- It was before the flight. 

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.190
And, like I said, 
I am getting out of here. 

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.580
We know about your 
personal life, Mrs. Ross. 

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.160
ItТs our job. 

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.190
But you better forget 
this idea about leaving. 

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.200
You canТt stop me. 

01:12:25.201 --> 01:12:27.300
I canТt stop you leaving this house. 

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.390
But I can and I will stop 
you leaving EUROSEC. 

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.140
You can talk to him now. 

01:12:41.141 --> 01:12:43.141
So... 

01:12:43.142 --> 01:12:45.142
Everything is reversed, huh? 

01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:47.743
- Everything. 
- But, Glenn,... 

01:12:47.744 --> 01:12:50.144
we are going to check a few things. 

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.650
All right. 

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.540
Set it up. 

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.280
Now, watch the mirror, please. 

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.300
Thank you. 

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:08.310
Read it! 

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.170
Fire emergency check list: 

01:13:10.171 --> 01:13:13.240
In event of fire priorities 
are assigned as follows: 

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:15.250
First-Documentation, 
Second-Research specimens, 

01:13:15.251 --> 01:13:17.251
Thirth - Photographic material, 
Fourth - Progress report... 

01:13:17.252 --> 01:13:19.252
All right. 

01:13:19.253 --> 01:13:20.253
Good enough for you? 

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:25.750
What the hell more do you want? 

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.940
I don't envy him. 

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:03.150
<i> You completed your mission? </i> 

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.680
<i> Why did you turn back? </i> 

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.100
<i> We crashed! </i> 

01:15:08.101 --> 01:15:10.101
<i> Why? </i> 
<i> Why? </i> 

01:15:10.102 --> 01:15:12.102
<i> Why? </i> 
<i> Why? </i> 

01:15:12.103 --> 01:15:14.103
<i> WHY? </i> 
<i> WHY? </i> 

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.640
<i> You completed your mission? </i> 

01:16:06.999 --> 01:16:09.180
<i> Why did you turn back? </i> 

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.190
<i> We crashed! </i> 

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200
<i> Why? </i> 
<i> Why? </i> 

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:15.210
<i> Why? </i> 
<i> Why? </i> 

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:18.220
<i> WHY? </i> 
<i> WHY? </i> 

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:28.670
Satisfied? 

01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:31.000
Satisfied? 

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:33.950
Satisfied, that I was telling 
the truth about the new planet.  

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.970
You are bound to be a little confused, 
until the drug wears off. 

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.780
- You are trying to check up my story, right? 
- Yeah. 

01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:41.790
You couldn't fault it, right? 

01:16:41.791 --> 01:16:43.791
- No, we coludnТt fault it. 
- Right. 

01:16:43.792 --> 01:16:45.792
You will hear the same story 
from John Kane. 

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:04.710
<i> What happened? </i> 

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.920
<i> Tell me! </i> 

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.420
I am sorry I am late. 

01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:19.490
I was detained at the medical centre. 

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.150
Come and sit down. 

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.230
What I have to say to 
you, is very important. 

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.570
No, Jason, you sit down. 

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.900
You checked me, interrogated me, 
you looked in to my brain 

01:19:30.901 --> 01:19:34.180
and you found out nothing. I want 
you to sit down and listen to me. 

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.550
I am listening. 

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:44.730
Now, what I am going to tell you, 

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:46.780
is bizarre, weird. 

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.970
But itТs the only theory, 
that fits the facts. 

01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:54.968
I propose a complete 
duplication of matter. 

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:59.590
A situation, where every single 
atom, every molecule here... 

01:19:59.591 --> 01:20:01.630
... is duplicated here. 

01:20:01.631 --> 01:20:03.700
Except that it is in reverse. 

01:20:04.999 --> 01:20:07.790
Then, when I left Earth 
to travel to the new planet, 

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.940
another man left the new planet, 

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:14.390
at precisely the same 
time to travel to Earth. 

01:20:14.590 --> 01:20:16.900
Another Colonel Ross. 

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.680
The man you know as Colonel Ross, 

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.500
is on the other planet, standing in 
an identical, except reversed, room, 

01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:27.790
talking to an identical Jason Webb, 
who is sitting in an identical chair, 

01:20:27.791 --> 01:20:30.350
rubbing his hands together 
in this exact moment. 

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:35.410
Look here. 

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.630
Now, what do you see? 

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:46.120
Go on. 

01:20:46.121 --> 01:20:49.320
You see the mirrored images 
of Jason Webb and Glenn Ross. 

01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:51.490
There are four people in this room. 

01:20:51.491 --> 01:20:53.610
Two Jason Webbs, two Glenn Rosses. 

01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:59.680
What I am trying to say is, these two 
planets have a physical connection. 

01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:01.690
One is the mirrored image of the other. 

01:21:01.691 --> 01:21:03.691
But unlike the reflection 
in the mirror, 

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.692
they both exist. 

01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:08.693
For every person on one planet 
there is a double on the other. 

01:21:09.634 --> 01:21:13.960
DonТt you understand? Until a few 
days ago you and I have never met. 

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.620
Are you trying to tell me, that you 
donТt know any of the people here? 

01:21:18.621 --> 01:21:21.650
Your wife? 
Lisa, Newman? 

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.810
Only their Doppelgдngers. (from German: mythology, folklore, 
literature (romanticism): evil twin, astral body, 
bilocation phenomenon or disastrous prophesy.)

01:21:23.811 --> 01:21:26.810
- Dopp... What? - Doppelgдngers. Doubles. 
(Literature: Gilgamesh, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Sheley, Dostoyevsky, 
Andersen, Hawthorn, Salvatore, R. L. Stevenson, J. Conrad etc.) 

01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:30.670
In a literal translation, the mirrored 
imaghes of themselves. (Movie: David Linch-
Tween Peaks, Stanley Kubrik-Eyes Wide Shut etc.) 

01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.310
I better get you a drink. 
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:41,310

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:38.880
All right, I know how it sounds. 

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:41.650
Could you think of anything better? 

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.780
I wish to God I could. 

01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:49.160
When I got your call, 

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:53.380
- Dr. Pontini had just completed 
the post-mortem of John Kane. 
- And? 

01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:58.699
KaneТs internal organs were found to 
be on the oposite side from normal. 

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.700
My normal, that is. 

01:22:01.701 --> 01:22:03.701
It was all there, 

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:07.300
on the computer readouts, when 
you had your electronic medicals,  

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:09.940
I assumed wrongly, 

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960
that it was a fault. 

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:14.160
Lesson number one: 
never distrust a computer. 

01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:16.170
So you see your theory holds up. 

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:20.250
It would seem I am not that 
Jason Webb, that you know. 

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:25.090
Only... an impish Doppelgдnger. 

01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:30.920
How do you do, Coronel Ross? 

01:22:31.340 --> 01:22:34.910
- ItТs only a theory. 
- But itТs the best that you could come up with. 

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.640
But we canТt prove it, 
till we recover the Phoenix. 

01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:39.650
And what if we are right? 

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.920
You realize, that your version of the "Dove" 
would not be able to dock with the Phoenix. 

01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:46.630
We'll have to reverse the controls 
and the electrical systems. 

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:51.280
Or does the polarity of the 
electricity remain the same? 

01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:53.980
Well? Does it? 

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.680
If we are wrong...  

01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:59.660
... you do realize what 
would happen to you? 

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:03.360
Chance I am willing to take. 

01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.400
And the other Colonel Ross? 

01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:10.960
Are you willing to take 
the chance on him too? 

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.960
That was a penny for your toughts. 

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.930
If they are as confused as mine, 
maybe sharing them would help? 

01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:46.720
Did you say a penny? 

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.380
Well, itТs a buyers' market. 

01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:55.590
What would you like to know? 

01:23:55.599 --> 01:23:58.240
- Sharon has left? 
- Yes. 

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.100
In a way, she left 
a long time ago. 

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:07.720
- Are you going to recover the Phoenix? 
- Yes. 

01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:11.320
With reversed vision, how 
will you operate the controls?  

01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:13.620
Eh, it should be interesting. 

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.720
DonТt do it, Glenn. 

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.990
You have done enough for Jason. 

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:21.370
Well, itТs not really just for Jason. 

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.440
I donТt understand. 

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:27.360
Well, you know how it is, there is so much 
I am not supposed to talk about. 

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.360
Did you mind me coming over? 

01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:36.550
No, as a matter of fact, 
I am glad you are here. 

01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:38.760
Someone to talk to. 

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.990
Why did you reverse 
DOPPELGƒNGER, Coronel? 

01:25:09.999 --> 01:25:12.640
It's an inside joke 
between me and myself. 

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:15.630
- Good luck, Sir. 
- Thank you. 

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:41.530
- Network check completed? 
- All set. 

01:25:41.850 --> 01:25:43.850
Proceed condition. 

01:25:44.001 --> 01:25:46.310
Proceed condition. 

01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:56.390
This is EUROSEC launch control. 

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.610
Phoenix on horizon. 

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.640
Lift-off eight seconds. 

01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:02.770
<i> Roger, Control. </i> 

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:05.990
On board computer indicates 
lift-off five seconds. 

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.690
Four, three, two, one... 

01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:38.200
Report on ground systems. 

01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:40.330
<i> Procedures check: 
All systems go. </i> 

01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.510
Roger. 

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.300
You couldnТt stay away, hm?

<i> Launch control, 
this is Doppelgдnger. </i> 

01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:03.390
Airspeed: 12,500. 

01:27:04.050 --> 01:27:06.050
Roger, Doppelgдnger. 

01:27:06.051 --> 01:27:08.640
Countdown for 
second stage: 10 seconds. 

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:14.370
5 seconds. 

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:18.190
four, three, two, one... 

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.040
Control, this is Doppelgдnger. 

01:27:26.041 --> 01:27:28.041
Now leaving the EarthТs atmosphere. 

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:30.042
Roger, Doppelgдnger. 

01:27:30.043 --> 01:27:33.130
Rocket shut-down. 
5 seconds.

three, two, one... 

01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:46.860
Launch control, this is 
Doppelgдnger, in orbit. 

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:49.110
Roger, Doppelgдnger. 

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.470
Stand by for the computer report 
on Phoenix position. 

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.100
Doppelgдnger, this is 
EUROSEC Launch control. 

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.660
Computer reports Phoenix 20 miles ahead. 

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:10.390
Your orbital position is correct for 
automatic approach to EUROSEC, 

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:12.520
<i> should there be an emergency condition. </i> 

01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:14.910
Thank you, Control. 

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.100
I see it now. 

01:28:17.101 --> 01:28:19.190
See it now, Control. 

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.200
Beginning docking manoeuvers. 

01:28:21.201 --> 01:28:25.201
From now on it will be just 
as easy, as ... parking a car. 

01:28:25.202 --> 01:28:28.202
For a man with reversed vision? 

01:28:50.370 --> 01:28:53.720
To Launch control from Doppelgдnger, 
is Jason Webb there? 

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.990
Jason Webb here. 

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
About to dock, Jason. 
Any additional orders? 

01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:01.360
Proceed with docking.

Jason, I'm not reading... 

01:30:15.730 --> 01:30:18.440
I repeat, we lost your 
last transmission. 

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.640
<i> Jason, IТm not reading you,

"Dove" now on 
automatic control. 

01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:45.880
Roger. 

01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:47.890

Phoenix re-entry. 

01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:45.770
Is there a separate 
reading for "Dove"? 

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.100
No, sir. 

01:31:48.101 --> 01:31:50.160
