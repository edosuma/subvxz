"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"...

00:02.510 --> 00:04.111
Rebecca Bunch,
I have loved you

00:04.179 --> 00:05.557
since the moment
that I saw you

00:05.625 --> 00:06.994
freshman year in the cafeteria.

00:07.062 --> 00:08.164
This isn't happening.

00:08.257 --> 00:09.335
You know what they say...

00:09.403 --> 00:11.853
One person's blackmailing is
another person's love story.

00:11.921 --> 00:14.000
Have you ever noticed how
when a male patient dies,

00:14.092 --> 00:15.906
he's all like, beep...

00:15.976 --> 00:19.703
But when a female patient dies,
she's like beep, beep, beep!

00:19.780 --> 00:21.515
I'm so glad we're in business together.

00:21.609 --> 00:24.656
You're so good at charts
and getting deals on stuff.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.179
That's so sexy.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.580
- God, Boggle.
- What? Oh...

00:28.648 --> 00:30.227
This should never
happen again after this.

00:30.294 --> 00:32.286
Absolutely, this is the last time.

00:32.398 --> 00:34.017
Last time. The last time.

00:34.094 --> 00:36.620
You're seeing someone else,
she's your girlfriend,

00:36.697 --> 00:39.023
and I'm your "friend."

00:39.140 --> 00:41.548
So it's possible
I may have ordered

00:41.616 --> 00:43.260
a hit on Nathaniel's
girlfriend Mona.

00:43.328 --> 00:45.353
But it's okay, I undid it
this morning immediately.

00:45.421 --> 00:46.720
At least I tried to.
Hope I did.

00:46.788 --> 00:48.049
I think I did.
I probably did.

00:48.117 --> 00:50.148
The last few months
have meant a lot to me.

00:50.265 --> 00:51.695
And if that's what you want,

00:53.391 --> 00:54.968
I'll forget about everything else

00:55.109 --> 00:57.883
and everyone else,
for you.

01:15.025 --> 01:16.816
So, do you have to, like,
study,

01:16.884 --> 01:18.204
everywhere we go?

01:18.272 --> 01:20.067
I have a final. It's an ethics class.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.301
It's hard.

01:21.443 --> 01:23.892
Well, just copy your
ethics off someone else.

01:23.963 --> 01:27.704
Right? Also, Rebecca,
what's up with the knitting?

01:27.781 --> 01:31.732
Um, it's crocheting, and
she's trying to relax.

01:32.021 --> 01:34.783
She and Nathaniel are...

01:34.943 --> 01:36.942
Hey, yeah, so maybe
there's a better mime

01:37.010 --> 01:39.916
we can do around someone who
survived a suicide attempt.

01:39.984 --> 01:41.877
It's fine, yes.
Nathaniel and I are done.

01:42.106 --> 01:43.113
Okay?

01:43.213 --> 01:44.221
Clearly, I wasn't ready

01:44.298 --> 01:45.392
to be in a relationship.

01:45.469 --> 01:47.127
Also, he was seeing
someone else.

01:47.204 --> 01:49.220
That...
always works out great.

01:49.660 --> 01:51.420
Exactly,
it did not work out.

01:51.504 --> 01:53.470
Which is great,
because now

01:53.707 --> 01:55.323
I get some well-deserved
me time.

01:55.588 --> 01:56.770
Yeah, I get some hot

01:56.847 --> 01:58.735
Rebecca-on-Rebecca
action.

01:58.812 --> 02:01.275
Yeah, I don't need a man.
And you know what says that?

02:01.559 --> 02:03.291
This soon-to-be
afghan.

02:03.551 --> 02:05.730
- I like that attitude.
- You go, girl.

02:05.817 --> 02:08.137
- Other supportive girl thing.
- Yeah.

02:08.207 --> 02:09.660
You know what, from now
on, my life is gonna get

02:09.727 --> 02:11.782
an A-plus on the Bechdel test.

02:11.885 --> 02:13.623
Well, actually,
since the Bechdel test

02:13.691 --> 02:15.569
is a measure of how often
women talk about men,

02:15.637 --> 02:17.580
the act of talking
about the Bechdel test

02:17.705 --> 02:20.427
kind of technically means
you've failed the Bechdel test.

02:20.504 --> 02:22.732
Okay, thank you,
feminism referee.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.247
And you know
what the best thing is

02:24.315 --> 02:26.200
about being alone,
potentially forever?

02:26.986 --> 02:28.630
I know
what the future holds now.

02:29.032 --> 02:30.614
The way ahead is clear,

02:31.115 --> 02:33.666
and I know exactly
what I need to do next.

06:04.028 --> 06:05.519
I said "Blam."

06:05.900 --> 06:07.460
Yeah, I heard you.

06:09.019 --> 06:11.191
So, what, you just never
heard back from Rebecca?

06:11.366 --> 06:12.389
No.

06:12.466 --> 06:14.428
I basically offered to
give up everything for her,

06:14.505 --> 06:17.413
and the next thing you
know, I got this text.

06:18.819 --> 06:20.248
And then I sent that text.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.537
- And that was it.
- Huh.

06:22.612 --> 06:24.298
Rebecca and I
see each other at work,

06:24.366 --> 06:26.526
and we just act like the
whole thing... never happened.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.354
- Yeah, that sounds healthy.
- Yeah, well...

06:28.422 --> 06:30.989
- What's wrong, baby?
- You thirsty? Want some water?

06:33.366 --> 06:35.295
Hey, uh, quick question,

06:35.717 --> 06:38.446
why is it that all of my friends,
including you,

06:38.514 --> 06:39.741
are in love with Rebecca?

06:40.092 --> 06:42.110
Does she have
a magic vagina?

06:42.303 --> 06:43.324
No.

06:43.428 --> 06:44.813
She has a great one,
though.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.553
And she does like when
I refer to it as the Sorting Hat.

06:52.058 --> 06:53.624
Harry Potter dirty talk.

06:53.709 --> 06:55.561
- Don't worry about it.
- Yikes.

06:55.872 --> 06:58.744
So, uh... so what's
going on with Mona, then?

06:58.812 --> 07:00.045
You still seeing her?

07:00.358 --> 07:02.631
I've just been
avoiding her,

07:02.709 --> 07:04.944
which is
ridiculous.

07:05.116 --> 07:06.852
I keep telling her that
work is crazy.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.022
It's not crazy.

07:08.115 --> 07:10.826
- It's not fair to her, you know?
- Hmm.

07:10.936 --> 07:12.616
Mona's great.
She doesn't deserve this.

07:12.685 --> 07:14.722
Yeah, I know. It's pretty
crappy what you're doing.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.558
Ah, there it is.
There's that famous

07:16.644 --> 07:18.279
judginess
I've heard so much about.

07:18.347 --> 07:20.675
I'm even getting it from
your dog down there. Hello.

07:22.151 --> 07:23.242
That's a good boy.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.875
Look, I know
I should move on, okay?

07:24.942 --> 07:26.612
I just can't seem to do it.

07:26.698 --> 07:28.490
I don't know, I guess
a part of me is hoping

07:28.566 --> 07:31.319
that Rebecca will
come around eventually.

07:32.812 --> 07:34.706
When will I ever get the message?

07:35.033 --> 07:36.802
When are you gonna
get the message, Trent?

07:36.909 --> 07:38.548
I don't want to see you.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.605
Okay, Paula told me
it was you

07:40.673 --> 07:43.446
that gave Josh my medical
records right before my wedding.

07:43.805 --> 07:45.949
You almost ruined my life,
maniac!

07:46.048 --> 07:48.385
You mean saved your life,
lover?

07:48.462 --> 07:51.808
No. You blowing up my wedding,
uh, kind of put me on the path

07:51.876 --> 07:54.438
- to almost killing myself, so...
- Oh, come on,

07:54.506 --> 07:56.018
that's a reach.
I mean, take some

07:56.086 --> 07:57.511
responsibility for your actions.

07:57.579 --> 08:00.344
I saved you from being in a
marriage you didn't even want.

08:00.524 --> 08:03.352
And now I'm here to claim
my prize for a job well done.

08:03.688 --> 08:04.834
You.

08:04.911 --> 08:06.300
What? Here to claim your prize?

08:06.368 --> 08:07.696
It's been months.

08:07.774 --> 08:09.276
I mean,
where the hell have you been?

08:09.353 --> 08:11.479
Oh, you have no idea
what I've done

08:11.547 --> 08:13.508
to fight my way back to you.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.227
After I dropped the
documents off to Josh...

08:16.295 --> 08:17.362
Here you go.

08:17.446 --> 08:19.743
All I had to do was wait
for your wedding to fail.

08:19.946 --> 08:21.485
So I rented a drone

08:21.562 --> 08:24.672
with a camera, and I watched
as your wedding fell apart.

08:24.778 --> 08:25.979
Victory!

08:26.047 --> 08:27.257
Then I tracked you

08:27.326 --> 08:30.399
to the weirdly foreboding
Covina Inn and Suites.

08:30.485 --> 08:32.015
I knew you were alone.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.369
All I had to do was claim
my prize, my princess.

08:35.453 --> 08:37.594
I'm coming to rescue you,
Rebecca.

08:37.662 --> 08:40.578
And just as I was about to
save you from your tower...

08:41.172 --> 08:42.907
I heard the sound of a train.

08:43.110 --> 08:45.600
You know how I feel
about clowns and trains.

08:46.616 --> 08:49.696
Ironic, then, that I was
hit by a bus and not a train.

08:50.047 --> 08:54.110
That was the beginning of
the worst months of my life.

08:54.922 --> 08:57.258
Every bone in my body
was broken,

08:57.586 --> 08:59.539
except, unfortunately,
my ear bones.

08:59.607 --> 09:02.461
Hey, Trent, how you doing, buddy?

09:02.602 --> 09:04.231
Oh, that's right.
You can't talk.

09:04.308 --> 09:06.830
Ooh-hoo, my favorite kind of audience.

09:06.907 --> 09:10.141
Would you mind hearing
some of my new stand-up set?

09:10.485 --> 09:12.284
So, this patient comes in

09:12.352 --> 09:14.426
with a yellowish
discoloration of the skin.

09:14.503 --> 09:16.910
His name was Jack Nicholson.

09:16.987 --> 09:19.805
He says, uh,
"Here's Jaundice!"

09:19.873 --> 09:21.891
I have, like, maybe 40 more.
Can I run them by you?

09:21.959 --> 09:25.081
I spent the next six months
of my life in terrible pain.

09:25.149 --> 09:27.112
She's always got to go
collect the urine sample

09:27.180 --> 09:29.347
- with all the other female patients.
- Both physically...

09:29.414 --> 09:32.495
I used to call it the
dab ointment and lean.

09:32.563 --> 09:33.807
And comedically.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.940
Gynecological obstetrics!

09:36.008 --> 09:38.118
Till one day I could no
longer take it

09:38.266 --> 09:41.766
and I mustered all of my energy
and I broke free from my casts.

09:44.047 --> 09:46.993
I knew Dr. Roth would have the
authorities out there looking for me.

09:47.157 --> 09:48.851
He was developing
a one-man show,

09:48.919 --> 09:50.277
and he needed my help.

09:50.354 --> 09:52.141
So I stole a hog

09:52.360 --> 09:55.235
and decided to head out to
the desert to recuperate.

09:56.336 --> 09:58.864
I holed up
in a cave in the Mojave.

10:01.758 --> 10:03.762
And I hung with a pack of
coyotes,

10:03.956 --> 10:06.398
and they taught me how to howl again.

10:12.533 --> 10:14.358
That's when
I knew that I was ready

10:14.426 --> 10:16.308
to find my way back to you.

10:17.063 --> 10:19.854
So I Wazed directions back
towards the Brooks Brothers

10:19.922 --> 10:21.710
at the Desert Hills
Premium Outlets

10:21.787 --> 10:23.524
to find myself some clothes.

10:24.117 --> 10:25.867
I'm an outlet guy.

10:26.532 --> 10:27.848
And I came here.

10:27.974 --> 10:29.432
Oh, my God!

10:29.500 --> 10:30.718
Mm-hmm.

10:30.795 --> 10:33.253
I mean, that's the most
insane story I've ever heard.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.651
Honestly, I'd be impressed

10:34.728 --> 10:36.823
if I weren't so disgusted
by you as a person.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.204
Okay, so just...

10:38.313 --> 10:40.126
You told me your story,
now get out of here, Trent.

10:40.193 --> 10:42.157
All right, your timing
couldn't be worse.

10:42.237 --> 10:44.625
I am not looking for anything
right now.

10:44.693 --> 10:46.469
I'm browsing cat websites.

10:46.610 --> 10:49.073
I'm-I'm making a crocheted
blanket for Darryl's baby.

10:49.141 --> 10:50.690
Why am I tell you this?
Just get out.

10:50.758 --> 10:52.117
You leave me no choice, then.

10:52.373 --> 10:55.192
I'm gonna have to blackmail you
into being my girlfriend again.

10:55.367 --> 10:57.377
Yeah, buddy,
you can't blackmail me, okay?

10:57.445 --> 11:00.974
Everyone already knows all of my top
secret personal info, thanks to you.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.570
Oh, I have way better
info than that now.

11:03.756 --> 11:06.437
Does Pretzel365 ring a bell?

11:06.570 --> 11:08.721
Perhaps a handle that
you used on a little thing

11:08.797 --> 11:11.297
we like to call
the Dark Web?

11:12.853 --> 11:14.695
How do you know about the Dark Web?

11:15.180 --> 11:17.156
The Dark Web is my playground,
baby.

11:17.224 --> 11:19.601
I have a Dark Web alert
on your I.P. address.

11:20.373 --> 11:21.712
I saw that, one night, you were trying

11:21.779 --> 11:23.609
to take a hit out on a girl
called Mona.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.402
I have all the info.

11:25.844 --> 11:27.750
I printed out a hard copy

11:28.430 --> 11:31.867
'cause hard copies just have
more gravitas. There you go.

11:34.053 --> 11:36.303
No. No, no, no. No, no.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.408
Oh, my God, but...

11:42.762 --> 11:44.354
I was out of my mind on hormones,

11:44.431 --> 11:47.360
and I undid it all the next day.
I never meant to hurt anyone.

11:47.437 --> 11:50.363
Oh, cool. So you don't mind if
I distribute that to everyone,

11:50.440 --> 11:53.396
and you get arrested and
disbarred and sent to prison

11:53.473 --> 11:55.035
for solicitation of murder for hire

11:55.112 --> 11:58.393
under federal statute 18, U.S.C. 1958?

11:59.898 --> 12:04.211
Whee! I'm your boyfriend again.

12:13.406 --> 12:16.062
Mm, any update on that
Jessica Alba charity event?

12:16.250 --> 12:18.151
I told you, we're not
getting that party.

12:18.219 --> 12:20.704
Every event planning company
in town is pursuing it.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.176
But you know her.

12:22.253 --> 12:24.432
I L.A. know her.
I spun next to her,

12:24.500 --> 12:25.877
I juiced behind her,
and one time,

12:25.945 --> 12:27.660
I was at a gifting
suite in front of her.

12:27.728 --> 12:29.008
That's the extent of it.

12:29.094 --> 12:31.306
I texted her assistant, but
we're not gonna hear back.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.777
Beth, we need a really cool party

12:32.854 --> 12:34.981
to get a lot of attention
and raise our profile.

12:35.058 --> 12:38.133
I mean, nothing could
possibly lower our profile.

12:38.203 --> 12:40.937
We work... out of a
children's baseball bar.

12:41.321 --> 12:44.649
I just want to work on classy
events with classy people.

12:44.781 --> 12:46.103
What up, Home Base?

12:46.180 --> 12:49.617

Hey, Josh. Uh, you know,
you can call me Beth now.

13:06.017 --> 13:07.134
We've met a couple times.

- See? You're so cool.
- Thank you.

13:10.088 --> 13:11.533
Turn that thing off.
We're working.

13:11.610 --> 13:12.902
Oh. I know you're working,

13:12.979 --> 13:14.299
and that's exactly why I'm here.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.498
Here to pitch to you my DJ services.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.076
Oh, I've been deejaying
at my club, and I ran

13:20.144 --> 13:22.649
into Monica F. from high school,
who said her little sister's

13:22.717 --> 13:25.026
having a sweet 16 at the rec center,

13:25.103 --> 13:27.220

you to plan the party.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.591

13:31.843 --> 13:33.495
Me. It's me.

13:33.711 --> 13:35.236
I'm not doing that party.

13:35.313 --> 13:36.705
She already asked me; I said no.

13:36.782 --> 13:39.644
V, we can't turn down
events, any events.

13:39.721 --> 13:41.215
We work here.

13:41.292 --> 13:42.981
We have to buy onion rings every hour

13:43.058 --> 13:44.449
just to keep the Wi-Fi going.

13:44.526 --> 13:45.550
We're doing the party.

13:45.787 --> 13:47.248
Awesome. Hire me.

13:47.317 --> 13:49.101
- I'll do it for free.
- Great, you're hired.

13:49.177 --> 13:51.072
Also, you're not very
good at negotiating.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.387
Okay, fine.

13:52.464 --> 13:53.588
But if we're doing it,

13:53.665 --> 13:55.656
we're doing it my way, chic and elegant.

13:55.733 --> 13:57.366
Great. As long as I pick the music.

13:57.443 --> 13:58.459
Absolutely not.

13:58.536 --> 14:00.128
But that's all a DJ does.

14:00.205 --> 14:02.483
No. They also bring in
equipment and push buttons.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.304
But can we at least do the Royal?

14:04.381 --> 14:06.337
I've been dying for a kid's party

14:06.414 --> 14:08.766
- to expose it to a new generation.
- The Royal?

14:08.843 --> 14:10.471
Oh, God, don't listen to him.

14:10.548 --> 14:11.725
Shut up about it, Josh.

14:11.802 --> 14:13.665
Oh, the Royal is the best.

14:13.742 --> 14:16.481
Okay. Uh, it's a dance Valencia
and I did in high school

14:16.558 --> 14:18.960
when we were voted
homecoming queen and king.

14:19.037 --> 14:20.948
Royal, get it?

14:21.025 --> 14:22.954
- Oh, yeah. 'Cause of...
- I said, shut up.

14:23.031 --> 14:24.345
Josh, no Royal,

14:24.422 --> 14:26.874
no cheesy music; that
is not my personal brand.

14:26.951 --> 14:30.769
Whatever you say. I... as long
as I got this gig, I'm happy.

14:30.976 --> 14:33.642
Fine. You've got the gig.

14:33.728 --> 14:35.406
Thank you.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.968
Also, never touch me again.

14:37.045 --> 14:39.467
Oh, cool. Is she still like that?

14:39.544 --> 14:41.573
That takes me back to
when we were dating.

14:41.650 --> 14:44.257
But you know what I'm talking
about, right, Beth?

14:44.334 --> 14:46.247
I don't have that problem,
Josh.

14:46.404 --> 14:48.445
Yeah. O-Okay.

14:49.273 --> 14:51.416
Oh,
so glad we're back together.

14:51.484 --> 14:55.413
And that was a great
19th game of Scrabble.

14:55.481 --> 14:59.672
Um, great bingo with "quixotry."

14:59.898 --> 15:04.258
Yeah. Triple letter score,
plus 50 bonus points... I win.

15:04.335 --> 15:05.660
Yeah. Well played.

15:05.729 --> 15:07.619
It's been so fun staying up
all night. Um, hey,

15:07.687 --> 15:09.296
so could I
have my phone back now?

15:09.373 --> 15:12.204
No. First, we have to
play Settlers of Catan

15:12.281 --> 15:14.405
and then Ticket to Ride,
and then maybe we can talk

15:14.482 --> 15:16.038
about you getting your phone back.

15:16.406 --> 15:18.101
Hey, instead of board games,

15:18.231 --> 15:22.093
how about we do something
more... immediate.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.767
- Sex?
- No.

15:23.844 --> 15:25.917
Uh... I would like to...

15:25.994 --> 15:27.327
show off...

15:27.404 --> 15:30.718
my... pookie.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.005
Wait. Me?

15:33.851 --> 15:35.348
I'm your pookie?

15:35.757 --> 15:38.062
No one has ever called
me a pookie before.

15:38.212 --> 15:40.070
This is... crazy.

15:40.234 --> 15:41.585
Well, today's your lucky day.

15:41.653 --> 15:43.189
I would like to take you
to my office

15:43.257 --> 15:44.432
and show you around.

15:44.509 --> 15:46.968
Everyone will be there
today, except for, sadly,

15:47.036 --> 15:49.344
Nathaniel, he'll be in a meeting,
but everyone else will be there.

15:49.411 --> 15:50.671
And you can see Paula.

15:50.739 --> 15:52.413
I-I didn't think we'd
get here this fast.

15:52.481 --> 15:54.945
I mean, I-I didn't expect to
get here until around month four

15:55.013 --> 15:57.351
in our relationship,
but I knew you'd come around.

15:57.546 --> 15:59.751
Yes.
Well, that's what's happening.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.582
Ooh, I got you a pretty dress

16:01.659 --> 16:03.555
for when we promenade. I'll go get it.

16:03.632 --> 16:05.851
Great. Okay.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.293
Say what we worked out in the car.

16:19.468 --> 16:21.378
Uh, hi, everybody.

16:21.531 --> 16:24.052
This is Trent, my ex.

16:24.265 --> 16:25.887
Uh, we're now back together.

16:25.957 --> 16:27.167
Yeah.

16:27.244 --> 16:29.086
Is there anything else you
want to say to this room full

16:29.153 --> 16:32.022
- of people, baby girl?
- Right. Um...

16:32.335 --> 16:33.851
I know that I said I wanted to live

16:33.928 --> 16:35.234
a life of quiet loneliness,

16:35.335 --> 16:38.896
but then... Trent came back.

16:38.973 --> 16:42.406
Um, Trent... is the love of my life.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.790
He is

16:43.858 --> 16:46.768
the Pyramus to my Thisbe.

16:50.534 --> 16:53.871
Wow. That was,
that was beautiful.

16:53.948 --> 16:55.703
- Trent.
- Hey.

16:55.780 --> 16:57.070
So good to see you.

16:57.163 --> 16:59.476
- Thank you.
- Look at you two.

16:59.890 --> 17:03.445
Finally together. Will they? Won't they?
I guess they will.

17:03.546 --> 17:04.896
So listen.

17:04.973 --> 17:07.098
I have a gushing period,

17:07.175 --> 17:09.597
and I need Rebecca's help for
a minute, so can you spare her?

17:09.674 --> 17:10.788
What kind of help?

17:10.865 --> 17:12.426
Ah, okay.

17:12.503 --> 17:15.412
Well, you know, with me,
it's like a four-hand job.

17:15.489 --> 17:17.749
I mean, I got to... I'm
putting in menstrual cups,

17:17.817 --> 17:19.718
a-a tampon, maybe a pillow.

17:19.809 --> 17:21.633
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's just... it's really...

17:21.897 --> 17:23.673
it's a NC-17 graphic,

17:23.741 --> 17:26.436
so can I go with her,
um, my love?

17:26.569 --> 17:28.960
Yes, of course. You know I think
menstruation is beautiful.

17:29.156 --> 17:31.222
It's my favorite time of
the month to make love.

17:31.299 --> 17:32.445
Ugh.

17:32.554 --> 17:35.399
- ♪ Period sex, period sex. ♪
- Nope.

17:35.467 --> 17:37.759
You don't get to sing that.
Okay. I'll be right back. Okay.

17:37.826 --> 17:40.811
Mmm... mwah.

17:40.995 --> 17:43.225
Oh.

17:43.691 --> 17:45.800
- Bye.
- Hold on one second.

17:48.596 --> 17:50.839
Yes. I'm-I'm sorry
I missed the meeting today.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.929
I've been, um,
busy at the office.

17:53.065 --> 17:55.792
I'll have my assistant
reschedule. Mm-hmm.

18:25.927 --> 18:28.896
Okay, Paula, it's bad. It's really bad.

18:28.973 --> 18:30.999
And I need your help now.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.691
Rebecca, what is going on?

18:39.768 --> 18:41.229
What's going on is I need your help.

18:41.306 --> 18:42.666
Okay? And-and not Good Paula help.

18:42.741 --> 18:44.333
I need Bad Paula help.

18:44.410 --> 18:45.430
Right?

18:45.507 --> 18:48.503
Not "I'm a lawyer and I want
to play by the rules now" Paula.

18:48.580 --> 18:51.136
I need surveillance-
camera-in-the-brooch,

18:51.213 --> 18:53.241
tracking-device-in-the-shoulder
Paula, now.

18:53.318 --> 18:56.032
- What? Why?
- Trent is blackmailing me.

18:56.951 --> 18:59.613
How? What does he have on you?

19:00.310 --> 19:02.717
- I don't think you want to know.
- Why?

19:02.794 --> 19:04.247
He just is, okay?

19:04.315 --> 19:06.612
So I need your help.
It's nothing we haven't done before.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.810
Okay, but...

19:08.044 --> 19:09.558
Honey, all that scheming...

19:09.635 --> 19:12.924
We have talked about
this... It is in the past.

19:13.001 --> 19:14.122
I have changed.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.930
- You have changed.
- Yes. Yes, I have,

19:16.998 --> 19:19.309
but sometimes the past comes
back to bite you in the butt.

19:19.377 --> 19:21.523
Oh, hey, look, if he's
threatening you with something

19:21.591 --> 19:23.419
serious, then
let's just go to the police.

19:23.512 --> 19:25.430
No, we can't go to the police;
that's how blackmail works.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.672
- That's why blackmail works.
- I'm sorry,

19:27.749 --> 19:30.234
but I want to be a lawyer,
and breaking the law

19:30.302 --> 19:33.684
is not a good idea for me
right now.

19:35.898 --> 19:38.448
Okay. Okay.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.534
Okay, okay.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.231
Paula, I...

19:51.348 --> 19:52.763
I didn't want to say this.

19:53.153 --> 19:54.971
I really didn't, but...

19:56.559 --> 19:58.977
Trent doesn't just have dirt on me,

19:59.208 --> 20:01.301
he has dirt on you, too.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.044
Yeah, and it's bad stuff.

20:04.153 --> 20:05.445
It's-it's all the stuff.

20:05.513 --> 20:07.585
It's the surveillance,
it's the bugging,

20:07.653 --> 20:09.476
it's the brick through
the window,

20:09.544 --> 20:10.758
the shoulder trackers, obviously.

20:10.825 --> 20:12.387
- Oh, my God.
- And, Paula,

20:12.464 --> 20:13.718
I just...

20:13.795 --> 20:15.450
you're in your second
year of law school,

20:15.518 --> 20:17.305
and you're basically already
the best lawyer I know,

20:17.372 --> 20:19.094
and Trent wants to take
that all away from you.

20:19.161 --> 20:20.872
- Oh, my God.
- He could get us both in trouble.

20:20.939 --> 20:22.364
He could get us both arrested.

20:22.441 --> 20:25.116
So, really, I'm here because
I'm looking out for you.

20:25.193 --> 20:29.223
I'm looking out for you and
your dreams and your family.

20:29.731 --> 20:31.552
So all we have to do,
we just have to do,

20:31.622 --> 20:33.975
just some teeny, teeny,
teeny, tiny things, huh?

20:34.052 --> 20:35.510
Let's take back his power.

20:35.587 --> 20:37.642
Let's blackmail the blackmailer.

20:37.719 --> 20:39.414
I really don't want to do this.

20:39.491 --> 20:40.939
Neither do I.

20:41.563 --> 20:42.809
But we have no choice.

20:42.903 --> 20:44.255
Both of us, right?

20:44.555 --> 20:46.988
I guess you're right?

20:47.065 --> 20:49.379
So come on. Hmm?

20:49.755 --> 20:51.494
One last time.

20:55.731 --> 20:57.777
I'll help you. It's like...

Okay, so is everything okay
at the house with Trent?

22:22.396 --> 22:24.364
I mean,
he's not making you do any...

22:24.776 --> 22:26.630
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.157
Okay. He's just sleeping at the
foot of the bed like he always does.

22:29.224 --> 22:30.609
Ah. I got to say,

22:30.677 --> 22:32.441
for a blackmailer,
he's decent on consent.

22:32.509 --> 22:34.265
- Hmm.
- I did let him give me

22:34.333 --> 22:36.422
a-a pedicure, though.

22:36.490 --> 22:38.568
He used this amazing
vanilla foot scrub.

22:38.636 --> 22:40.203
Anyway, we need to know
two things.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.694
One, the name of the
foot scrub, and two,

22:41.761 --> 22:43.794
we don't have anything
to blackmail him with yet.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.187
I know, and I couldn't
sleep all night,

22:45.254 --> 22:48.242
because I just kept thinking
about all the different things

22:48.310 --> 22:50.123
that he could get us
in trouble for.

22:50.999 --> 22:53.232
I mean,
why did I do all those things?

22:53.397 --> 22:55.864
No, no, no. Hey.
Don't beat yourself up, okay?

22:55.997 --> 22:57.343
We're-we're gonna get him.

22:57.411 --> 22:59.069
Okay. You're right.
We're gonna get him.

22:59.137 --> 23:00.606
We're gonna get him. Okay.

23:00.857 --> 23:01.944
Okay, Trent.

23:02.021 --> 23:04.438
Where do you go all day?

23:04.654 --> 23:06.986
Oh. It looks like he just
turned left off of East Cameron,

23:07.063 --> 23:08.554
and he's heading towards...

23:08.631 --> 23:10.419
- South Cameron?
- Ooh.

23:10.496 --> 23:12.725
I mean, that's like the
Knockturn Alley of West Covina.

23:12.802 --> 23:14.787
It's the place in Harry
Potter where bad things happen.

23:14.854 --> 23:15.921
You don't care. It's fine.

23:15.989 --> 23:17.092
Okay, it looks like he's...

23:17.169 --> 23:19.331
he's actually at the South
Cameron storage facility.

23:19.408 --> 23:21.090
That place is shady.

23:21.407 --> 23:22.678
Yeah, no, I've seen a bunch of cases

23:22.745 --> 23:24.825
where coyotes use it
as-as drop-off points.

23:24.893 --> 23:27.840
Oh, if he's mixed up with them.

23:28.162 --> 23:29.887
Wait, he is mixed up with coyotes.

23:29.972 --> 23:31.926
- What?
- Well, he told me all about it.

23:32.054 --> 23:36.406
They taught him how to survive,
how to howl, how to eat lizards.

23:36.606 --> 23:39.762
Do you think they followed him
to West Covina from the desert?

23:40.327 --> 23:41.564
Oh, my God, that's so cute.

23:41.632 --> 23:43.012
That's a Pixar movie.

23:43.577 --> 23:46.898
Rebecca, do you think
smugglers eat lizards?

23:47.090 --> 23:48.660
What are you talking about,
smugglers?

23:48.737 --> 23:50.958
Smugglers are called "coyotes."

23:52.605 --> 23:54.567
Oh, okay. That makes a lot more sense.

23:54.644 --> 23:56.326
- Yeah.
- So those montage visuals

23:56.403 --> 23:57.766
were from my point of view.

23:57.843 --> 24:00.012
- Yeah... oh, yeah.
- He's talking about smugglers, then.

24:00.079 --> 24:01.884
- Wait, he's talking about the...
- Oh, he's talking about the...

24:01.951 --> 24:03.385
- Totally can use it to blackmail him.
- Wait, wait.

24:03.452 --> 24:06.078
If he's doing illegal stuff
like-like weapons and...

24:06.155 --> 24:07.109
- drugs.
- Drugs.

24:07.186 --> 24:08.987
Yeah, we can use that
to neutralize him.

24:09.055 --> 24:10.621
Oh, my God, and then
it'll all be behind us,

24:10.688 --> 24:11.672
and we can get back to
our lives

24:11.740 --> 24:13.104
and our families
and-and my finals.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.416
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. See?

24:14.493 --> 24:16.207
I told you this was
just a little speed bump,

24:16.274 --> 24:18.821
and then we can go back to
being upstanding citizens.

24:18.938 --> 24:20.264
Okay.

24:20.516 --> 24:22.194
Yeah.

24:22.891 --> 24:25.686
Okay, make sure those
are alternating color.

24:27.806 --> 24:29.198
Mm-hmm.

24:29.275 --> 24:31.133
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

24:31.210 --> 24:34.036
- Good...
- Um, e-excuse me,

24:34.113 --> 24:35.261
Ms. Valencia?

24:35.355 --> 24:37.115
So, what do you think, Janie?

24:37.192 --> 24:39.908
Um, I wanted a theme.

24:39.985 --> 24:41.710
Something like Riverdale?

24:41.787 --> 24:45.156
Please, Janie, none of your friends
are hot enough to be on Riverdale.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.715
And there is a theme.

24:46.792 --> 24:49.555
It's the Jazz Age. 1920s.
Like Great Gatsby.

24:49.632 --> 24:50.727
Ha-cha.

24:50.804 --> 24:51.828
Okay.

24:52.103 --> 24:55.123
So are there gonna be glow sticks, then?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.805
Well, now you're just
trying to provoke me.

24:56.872 --> 24:58.397
Now go put on your sequined headband

24:58.474 --> 25:00.187
and floor-length pearl necklace.

25:00.445 --> 25:01.997
Okay, fine.

25:02.074 --> 25:04.686
And don't forget your ivory
cigarette holder and hip flask.

25:04.763 --> 25:07.035
Today is your day, Janie.

25:07.112 --> 25:08.507
Janie's loving this.

25:08.584 --> 25:11.640
- Yeah, she seems super stoked.
- She's fine.

25:11.717 --> 25:14.719
We're giving her a tasteful,
sophisticated, upscale event

25:14.796 --> 25:16.882
with photos that will
help promote our business.

25:16.959 --> 25:19.740
Oh, God knows that's
what every teenager wants.

25:20.726 --> 25:21.967
Hey, check it out.

25:22.044 --> 25:24.657
DJ Disc Joshy's in the house.

25:26.421 --> 25:27.756
You look great.

25:27.833 --> 25:29.258
I'm so hot, and it's so tight,

25:29.335 --> 25:30.796
I can't even raise the roof... look.

25:30.873 --> 25:33.019
See? Are you watching me do it?

25:33.121 --> 25:34.959
I mean, how am I
supposed to do the Royal

25:35.027 --> 25:36.111
when I can't even raise my arms?

25:36.178 --> 25:38.227
I told you, no Royal.

25:38.312 --> 25:40.981
Just pretend not to be a
lame townie for ten seconds.

25:41.050 --> 25:42.705
It's so embarrassing.

25:42.782 --> 25:44.710
Now go fire up some Lindy hop.

25:44.787 --> 25:46.902
Kids will be here any second.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.259
Thanking you.

25:50.789 --> 25:52.147
Come on.

25:52.224 --> 25:54.007
He's a nice guy.

26:00.717 --> 26:02.883
Hey.

26:03.961 --> 26:05.527
Thanks for coming, uh...

26:05.940 --> 26:08.124
I have something I want to ask you.

26:09.988 --> 26:12.401
You're only putting one
butt cheek on the chair.

26:12.478 --> 26:13.863
That's fair. I deserve that.

26:13.931 --> 26:16.777
Um, look, I know I've
been AWOL recently,

26:16.845 --> 26:18.089
but work's been really busy...

26:18.157 --> 26:19.274
I've been really busy, too.

26:19.351 --> 26:21.680
I launched a new campaign
for one of our overseas funds,

26:21.757 --> 26:24.777
but weirdly, my phone worked
while all that was happening.

26:25.022 --> 26:26.076
I'm sorry.

26:26.144 --> 26:27.549
- It's really rude.
- Yeah.

26:27.626 --> 26:30.079
We've been together for a
while, and you just ghosted on me

26:30.147 --> 26:31.271
for a few days.

26:31.339 --> 26:32.602
I was stupid.

26:32.679 --> 26:34.943
Okay? But it won't happen again.

26:35.418 --> 26:37.730
I want to make sure
we never go a few days

26:37.798 --> 26:39.339
without speaking to each other.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.051
So...

26:42.152 --> 26:44.246
why don't we move in together?

26:45.068 --> 26:46.365
Really?

26:46.433 --> 26:48.714
You're asking me
to move in with you

26:48.782 --> 26:51.159
after not calling me for
three days? That's bold.

26:51.292 --> 26:53.657
Well, I figured that, you know,
you and I have been together

26:53.725 --> 26:56.228
- for a few months now, and...
- Okay, cool.

26:56.427 --> 26:58.340
So, if we move in together,

26:58.408 --> 27:01.165
that means you'll stop
sleeping with Rebecca Bunch?

27:13.307 --> 27:14.575
What's he doing?

27:14.643 --> 27:16.700
I don't know, I mean,
I can't see what he's doing.

27:16.768 --> 27:19.766
Nope... is he leaving? No, wait.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.468
Okay. Okay.

27:32.030 --> 27:35.048
- And... scamper.
- Scamper.

27:37.652 --> 27:39.865
- Aah!
- Oh, you all right?

27:39.951 --> 27:41.430
Shh, shh.

27:41.507 --> 27:43.068
Who are we hiding from?
He's gone.

27:43.153 --> 27:45.021
- Shh!
- Okay.

27:51.889 --> 27:54.778
An anodized steel double
bolt tri-magnetite lock?

27:56.106 --> 27:58.191
I thought you were gonna
give me a challenge, Trent.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.087
Do you need the bolt
cutters from the car?

28:00.164 --> 28:01.775
Nah.

28:01.852 --> 28:03.756
Your earring.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.028
Mm-hmm.

28:07.818 --> 28:11.977
Come to... Mama.

28:16.993 --> 28:19.633
Let's get some dirt on
that turtlenecked psycho.

28:22.863 --> 28:28.571
- Oh...
- Oh...

28:30.969 --> 28:33.274
How did you know I was
sleeping with Rebecca?

28:34.502 --> 28:37.181
I wasn't sure, but thank you,
now I am.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.665
Oh-oh, God, I'm so sorry, Mona.

28:39.798 --> 28:42.377
I-I... but it's over
between her and I, I swear.

28:42.463 --> 28:44.253
Hey, it's fine,
I mean, for all you know,

28:44.321 --> 28:46.761
I've been sleeping with other
people the whole time, too.

28:48.941 --> 28:50.852
- Were you?
- No.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.994
Got some good offers,
but I liked the guy I was seeing

28:54.063 --> 28:55.734
and I was hoping he'd
come around.

28:55.811 --> 28:57.324
Which is pathetic, I know.

28:57.516 --> 29:00.088
My therapist, Dr. Akopian...
He's great, by the way...

29:00.165 --> 29:02.551
He keeps asking me, "Why are
you waiting around for this guy?

29:02.618 --> 29:04.625
Especially if you don't trust him?"

29:04.708 --> 29:05.765
I'm so sorry.

29:05.983 --> 29:07.822
I'm a jerk. Okay?

29:07.958 --> 29:11.322
I don't know why I did that to
you, but it won't happen again.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.759
I should have spoken up sooner.

29:14.648 --> 29:17.775
But people like us, we
were not raised to confront.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.442
Or be honest.

29:19.519 --> 29:20.519
You know, we're WASPs.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.573
Our parents treat their marriages

29:22.650 --> 29:24.696
like business arrangements.

29:25.468 --> 29:27.188
I don't want that.

29:27.929 --> 29:29.887
I want something real.

29:30.062 --> 29:31.220
Wow.

29:31.297 --> 29:33.088
I mean, that's what I want, too.

29:33.165 --> 29:36.395
I-I think I didn't realize
that I could have that with you.

29:36.472 --> 29:38.085
Then you're an idiot.

29:38.445 --> 29:39.775
Yeah.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.163
So...

29:43.558 --> 29:45.885
where does that leave us?

29:48.723 --> 29:50.506
Let's just start with dinner.

29:51.517 --> 29:53.479
I love the bacon-wrapped dates here.

29:53.556 --> 29:54.687
Okay.

29:55.892 --> 29:57.346
Oh, God.

29:57.423 --> 29:59.666
What the hell?

30:10.158 --> 30:12.181
I mean, this is so much underwear.

30:12.249 --> 30:14.298
So much underwear.

30:14.574 --> 30:17.027
Okay, so he's been...
He's been stalking me

30:17.095 --> 30:18.121
since the moment we met.

30:18.189 --> 30:19.369
- Cool.
- Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

30:19.437 --> 30:20.556
Look at...

30:20.624 --> 30:22.395
Oh, look at all the sex
books. Lots of sex books.

30:22.462 --> 30:23.685
Okay.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.875
All right.

30:25.952 --> 30:27.816
Socks right here.

30:29.188 --> 30:30.965
Wait a second.

30:31.924 --> 30:33.319
These are all my socks.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.851
Every-every pair of socks I have

30:35.928 --> 30:37.286
has one sock missing.

30:37.363 --> 30:39.527
I have been wearing mismatched socks

30:39.604 --> 30:41.056
ever since I got to West Covina.

30:41.133 --> 30:42.628
Look it. Look it. How do I not...?

30:42.705 --> 30:44.330
I always wear mismatched socks.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.365
I look the host of a Nickelodeon show!

30:46.442 --> 30:48.316
Honey, that's not right.

30:48.393 --> 30:50.691
Oh! Oh, geez.

30:52.278 --> 30:55.161
Okay, this is just all ramen.

30:55.238 --> 30:57.206
Shrimp-flavored ramen.

30:57.283 --> 30:59.513
I mean, even his choice of
ramen flavor is upsetting.

31:00.836 --> 31:01.836
Hey.

31:01.904 --> 31:03.543
Ooh. Damn, damn, damn.

31:03.611 --> 31:05.074
Look at this, look at this. - Ooh.

31:05.142 --> 31:06.879
This definitely has a whole

31:07.044 --> 31:08.961
"hide my weapons and
drugs" type vibe, right?

31:09.029 --> 31:10.062
Yes.

31:10.130 --> 31:11.621
Although, mm,

31:11.764 --> 31:13.893
this is not the first
time on a caper you, or I,

31:13.970 --> 31:16.128
have thought that
someone was dealing drugs.

31:16.205 --> 31:17.660
But this time is different.

31:17.737 --> 31:19.632
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, does it have a lock?

31:19.709 --> 31:21.000
Or a combination?

31:21.077 --> 31:22.951
Um, actually, no.

31:23.123 --> 31:25.349
There's... there-there's
really no lock.

31:25.426 --> 31:26.802
Cool. I'm going in.

31:26.879 --> 31:28.040
Oh. You know what?

31:28.117 --> 31:30.364
I don't think...

31:32.166 --> 31:35.848
don't think we should open it.

31:37.095 --> 31:39.622
Yeah, it's never drugs.

31:50.277 --> 31:52.273
Man, I am so glad you're here

31:52.350 --> 31:54.123
visiting Rebecca again.

31:54.200 --> 31:57.349
Oh, my God, these
portobello puffs are so good.

31:57.426 --> 31:59.927
Oh, the secret is clarified
butter and cayenne.

32:00.004 --> 32:01.647
Oops. Secret's out.

32:01.724 --> 32:03.561
I mean, I don't know what
other pregnancies are like,

32:03.628 --> 32:06.206
but when I'm pregnant I crave your food.

32:06.283 --> 32:07.713
Cool.

32:09.983 --> 32:11.208
Oh, no.

32:11.285 --> 32:13.543
Oh, baby girl, no.

32:13.620 --> 32:15.315
I found my missing socks.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.346
What happened?

32:16.423 --> 32:18.519
Did you sleep with the Hulk impersonator

32:18.596 --> 32:19.657
on Hollywood Boulevard?

32:19.725 --> 32:20.772
There's a hot one.

32:20.840 --> 32:21.855
No, she didn't.

32:21.932 --> 32:23.979
It's my love test. You failed it.

32:24.574 --> 32:25.936
You've broken my heart.

32:26.013 --> 32:28.738
Okay, feels like you guys
have some things to work out,

32:28.815 --> 32:32.356
so I'm just gonna take these
tasty treats to go in my room.

32:33.182 --> 32:35.674
Trent, you booby-trapped
that trunk just for me?

32:35.742 --> 32:37.060
Yes, I did.

32:37.341 --> 32:39.259
I don't understand
why you don't trust me.

32:39.336 --> 32:40.660
Trust you?

32:41.615 --> 32:43.373
Trent, you're blackmailing me.

32:43.450 --> 32:44.545
Our relationship is

32:44.622 --> 32:47.577
90% based on fear and
ten percent on the hope

32:47.654 --> 32:49.694
that you'll make that fusilli
with duck ragout again.

32:49.761 --> 32:51.941
Why don't you love me?

32:52.634 --> 32:54.655
What's standing in the way of that?

32:54.732 --> 32:56.386
You.

32:56.463 --> 32:59.259
God, you should know by
now that I'm not interested.

32:59.336 --> 33:01.224
How would I know that?

33:01.301 --> 33:04.398
You've encouraged my attentions
every step of the way.

33:04.474 --> 33:06.204
You brought me here to pretend

33:06.272 --> 33:07.151
to be your boyfriend.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.049
You let me cook for
you and clean for you.

33:09.117 --> 33:10.323
You took my virginity.

33:10.391 --> 33:13.252
You've given me all these little
pieces of love along the way,

33:13.320 --> 33:14.565
these love kernels.

33:14.633 --> 33:16.054
Hmm.

33:16.216 --> 33:17.377
Well, you know what?

33:17.454 --> 33:18.829
Love kernels aren't reality.

33:19.471 --> 33:21.161
So get over it.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.617
You know, I thought we
were written in the stars,

33:23.694 --> 33:25.849
Rebecca Bunch.

33:26.190 --> 33:27.331
But I guess I was wrong.

33:27.399 --> 33:28.721
Trent, as someone who
used to think things

33:28.788 --> 33:30.509
were written in the
stars, take it from me,

33:30.904 --> 33:32.587
those feelings are not real.

33:33.274 --> 33:35.282
So blackmail me all you want.

33:35.627 --> 33:37.729
I'm never gonna love you.

33:38.813 --> 33:40.392
Okay.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.384
Wow.

33:42.745 --> 33:44.694
That was so mean.

33:48.071 --> 33:51.868
I'll remember those words
under a veil of my own tears.

33:52.678 --> 33:54.258
I'm gonna go.

33:55.548 --> 33:58.181
Here. Here.

33:58.376 --> 34:00.821
This is everything I have on you.

34:01.985 --> 34:05.157
It's all printed e-mails so it's
mainly just a symbolic gesture,

34:05.225 --> 34:06.759
but that's everything.

34:13.806 --> 34:15.969
- Good-bye, baby girl.
- Get out, Trent.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.001
Hey.

34:18.078 --> 34:22.092
Um, are the bacon-wrapped dates ready?

34:22.282 --> 34:23.887
Turn 'em over in five.

34:24.165 --> 34:25.837
They'll be ready in 20.

34:26.328 --> 34:28.068
Pookie out.

34:31.358 --> 34:34.087
So, did you want to
turn the dates over or...

34:34.155 --> 34:35.821
I will turn them over.

34:37.974 --> 34:41.431
Okay, I'll just wait in my room.

34:42.039 --> 34:43.635
Wait.

34:56.867 --> 34:58.161
Hey, honey, what's up?

34:58.229 --> 35:00.488
Paula, it's done.
We did it.

35:00.845 --> 35:03.578
- Trent's gone.
- He is? Really?

35:04.112 --> 35:06.851
- J-Just like that?
- Yeah. The whole thing was some sort of

35:07.039 --> 35:09.267
dumb love test or something.

35:09.335 --> 35:11.421
It's fine and he
destroyed all the evidence.

35:11.489 --> 35:12.702
So it's over.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.895
He's just
gonna leave us alone.

35:14.972 --> 35:16.257
We're safe?

35:16.371 --> 35:18.462
Oh, my God, I was so scared.

35:18.688 --> 35:21.507
Listen, God, thank you for everything.

35:21.715 --> 35:23.412
Oh, Paula, you're my best friend and...

35:23.480 --> 35:24.664
Okay, all right. I got to go.

35:24.732 --> 35:25.734
Bye, honey.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.511
Okay. Oh.

35:35.022 --> 35:36.413
Hey, kids.

35:36.490 --> 35:39.349
It's time for another Charleston again.

35:39.449 --> 35:42.350
And, uh, there are more
bacon-wrapped dates.

35:42.668 --> 35:46.648
Eat 'em while you can before
it's the Great Depression.

35:50.957 --> 35:53.100
Jessica Alba would love
this party, don't you think?

35:53.248 --> 35:55.256
Oh, yeah, I... I forgot to tell you.

35:55.324 --> 35:56.348
We didn't get it.

35:56.416 --> 35:57.922
They went with the
winner of Teen Chopped.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.774
Ugh, damn it. I can't believe
we didn't get that party.

36:00.851 --> 36:02.385
- Valencia.
- What?

36:02.462 --> 36:04.259
We already have a party.

36:04.851 --> 36:06.313
It's right here

36:06.390 --> 36:07.644
and it sucks.

36:07.721 --> 36:10.250
Of course it sucks because
it's in this stupid town

36:10.327 --> 36:12.219
- with these stupid people.
- Stop it.

36:12.296 --> 36:14.021
That's an awful way to talk.

36:14.098 --> 36:15.549
You're from here.

36:15.626 --> 36:17.691
So what? You're from
a stupid, small town.

36:17.775 --> 36:19.446
So was I before I moved to L.A.

36:19.514 --> 36:21.360
So are a lot of people.

36:21.711 --> 36:23.505
Don't be ashamed of
where you come from

36:23.574 --> 36:25.759
or who you are.

36:25.976 --> 36:27.438
He's not.

36:29.505 --> 36:32.344
And that's what makes him ridiculous.

36:32.484 --> 36:34.084
That's actually what makes him cool.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.101
It might be the only
thing that makes him cool,

36:36.177 --> 36:37.802
but, for the love of God,

36:37.988 --> 36:40.578
embrace this party
and make it fun.

36:40.869 --> 36:42.716
Janie deserves that.

36:48.862 --> 36:51.045
- Hold my phone.
- Of course.

36:58.217 --> 37:01.444

Hey.

38:13.852 --> 38:15.821
I'm sorry I was such a jerk to you.

38:16.118 --> 38:17.829
You're a really great DJ.

38:18.001 --> 38:19.281
Did a good job tonight.

38:19.444 --> 38:20.773
Thank you.

38:21.677 --> 38:24.374
And I'm also sorry that I
called you a lame townie.

38:24.544 --> 38:26.288
I mean, I'm a townie, too,

38:26.373 --> 38:28.131
but, I mean, I'm not lame.

38:28.305 --> 38:30.092
But I am from this place,

38:30.235 --> 38:34.117
I guess, and I'm okay with
my past.

38:34.257 --> 38:35.631
Sort of.

38:35.708 --> 38:39.196
You know, I have this movie
poster in my room that says,

38:39.264 --> 38:42.612
"You Can't Run Away from Your
Past because It's Your Future."

38:43.210 --> 38:45.193
It's from Space Karate II.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.166
That's us.

38:47.433 --> 38:50.032
I feel a strange emotion
towards you.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.279
- Respect?
- Never.

39:03.165 --> 39:04.690
Hey, Mama.

39:04.767 --> 39:06.626
Hey. I just wanted to, um...

39:06.694 --> 39:08.685
to thank you for all your help.

39:08.916 --> 39:11.172
Uh, I'm so glad everything
worked out.

39:11.406 --> 39:13.706
Oh. I mean, I-I can't believe

39:13.774 --> 39:16.001
that I left myself open
to blackmail like that,

39:16.069 --> 39:18.182
and I did all those dumb things and...

39:18.250 --> 39:20.558
Just stop, okay? You
learned your lesson.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.149
We both learned our lesson.

39:22.415 --> 39:24.540
It's okay. I, uh, I just...

39:25.557 --> 39:27.688
I wanted to say that
I'm so sorry.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.047
Oh, why are you sorry?

39:29.115 --> 39:31.901
I mean, it was Trent's fault.

39:32.695 --> 39:33.915
Right, it was Trent's fault.

39:33.983 --> 39:35.744
It was. I'm just...

39:37.480 --> 39:38.761
I'm just glad it's over.

39:38.838 --> 39:40.295
Yeah, me, too.

39:40.521 --> 39:41.684
Mmm.

39:43.377 --> 39:45.444
Oh.

39:48.744 --> 39:51.020
- Okay, I got to... get to it.
- Okay.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.760
Okay.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.772
What's... going on?

40:13.302 --> 40:16.168
Hi. Um, I decided it would be best

40:16.236 --> 40:18.263
if you and I didn't
work in the same office,

40:18.340 --> 40:19.802
and since you're the senior partner,

40:19.879 --> 40:21.236
I moved in here with Darryl.

40:21.313 --> 40:23.593
He keeps pushing me to get a bunk desk.

40:23.986 --> 40:25.364
Oh.

40:25.432 --> 40:27.572
So you'll be here from now on?

40:27.740 --> 40:29.701
Yeah, I think it's best.

40:29.981 --> 40:32.033
You've moved on, obviously.

40:32.641 --> 40:33.828
I have?

40:34.102 --> 40:36.611
I saw your new boyfriend...
The, um, big guy

40:36.822 --> 40:38.307
with the... with the turtleneck?

40:38.502 --> 40:39.951
No. Oh, my God.

40:40.028 --> 40:41.390
Wait. You saw him?

40:41.467 --> 40:43.196
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

40:43.273 --> 40:45.601
And I'm glad I did.
I think I needed to see it.

40:45.809 --> 40:47.223
Made me fully appreciate

40:47.293 --> 40:50.431
that Mona is a lot better
for me than I realized.

40:51.211 --> 40:53.799
Oh. Wow.

40:54.430 --> 40:55.541
Cool.

40:55.875 --> 40:58.297
I can't believe
I lied to her for so long.

40:59.430 --> 41:00.930
But that's on me.

41:01.517 --> 41:04.313
- Well, hey, that's.. that's on me, too.
- No.

41:04.390 --> 41:06.656
You weren't cheating.
I was cheating.

41:06.724 --> 41:09.219
Right, but what I did
wasn't great, either.

41:09.594 --> 41:12.492
I mean, sometimes I do
things that aren't great.

41:12.625 --> 41:14.479
No, you're good.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.547
I know you really well, Rebecca,
and you're a good person.

41:26.574 --> 41:28.383
Okay.

41:31.953 --> 41:34.635
<i>Especially, like, all
this going on, it's just...</i>

41:34.772 --> 41:37.470
<i>- Yeah.
- That is actually the case.</i>
