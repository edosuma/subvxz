QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

00:10.670 --> 00:11.739
Anyone recognize these faces?

00:11.750 --> 00:12.819
Victims of the Footpath Killer.

00:12.830 --> 00:14.707
That's what Virginia newspapers
are calling him.

00:14.710 --> 00:18.077
We refer to him
as the unknown subject or UnSub.

00:21.500 --> 00:25.948
I told Virginia P.D. they're
looking for a white male in his 205,

00:25.960 --> 00:27.609
who owns an American-made truck,

00:27.620 --> 00:29.531
works a menial job.

00:31.210 --> 00:34.828
I told them, "When you find him,
don't be surprised to hear him speak

00:34.830 --> 00:36.320
"with a severe stutter."

00:36.330 --> 00:40.994
Have a nice day.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.496
The gun.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.569
Take out the gun.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.572
-Throw it.
-Any particular direction?

01:40.120 --> 01:43.078
Who are...

01:45.330 --> 01:46.877
Who are you?

01:48.580 --> 01:52.698
-Who are you?
-FBI.

02:01.420 --> 02:04.617
Take out your wallet.

02:22.830 --> 02:25.572
What do you... What do you...

02:27.290 --> 02:31.033
-What do you know

02:32.620 --> 02:34.872
Or about the people you've murdered?

02:36.920 --> 02:38.706
I know a lot about you.

02:40.790 --> 02:45.079
I know how you do it.
I know you can't stop.

02:47.710 --> 02:51.919
And I know something that no one's
ever been able to tell you.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.877
I know why you stutter.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.419
Weren't you a little bit
worried he might just shoot you?

03:04.960 --> 03:07.781
-I was a lot worried.
-But how did you find him?

03:07.790 --> 03:09.576
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Training
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

03:09.580 --> 03:11.036
I was just stopping for gas.

03:11.040 --> 03:13.873
I walked into that store
and I saw pieces of a profile

03:13.880 --> 03:16.997
that I'd given a Virginia P.D.
almost a year ago.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.037
A truck in disrepair,
disheveled young man, severe stutter.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.742
James Reese once said, "There are
certain clues at a crime scene,

03:23.750 --> 03:24.876
"which, by their very nature,

03:24.880 --> 03:28.077
"do not lend themselves
to being collected or examined."

03:28.750 --> 03:33.665
How does one collect love,
rage, hatred, fear?

03:36.380 --> 03:38.530
These are things
that we're trained to look for.

03:38.540 --> 03:41.532
So anyone else
would've just seen a guy who stutters.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.610
But you saw the Footpath Killer.

03:44.210 --> 03:45.609
Right.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.999
But sometimes these guys
are still found by just dumb luck.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.115
Berkowitz was caught
because of a parking ticket.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.999
Except the cop who caught him wasn't
staring down a shotgun like you were.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.490
This is true.

03:58.420 --> 04:00.786
This is also a good time to stop.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.280
Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.575
Okay, I'm curious.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.069
Why'd he stutter?

04:18.080 --> 04:19.286
You're on your way to becoming

04:19.290 --> 04:22.077
a part of the Behavior Analysis team
now, Elle.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.160
You tell me.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.412
Check. Checkmate in three moves.

04:35.790 --> 04:36.825
What?

04:37.460 --> 04:39.451
You know, you'll beat him
when you start learning.

04:39.460 --> 04:42.702
-Learning what?
-To think outside the box.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.786
-Question for you.
-Shoot

04:47.790 --> 04:49.326
The Footpath Killer.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.280
Why did he stutter?

04:51.960 --> 04:54.167
Come on, Elle, we've all asked him
and he won't say.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.910
He wants us to figure it out.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.206
Well, okay. I'm up for a challenge.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.031
Good. Because these go to you.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.326
Special Agent Jennifer Jareau.
JJ if you like.

05:03.330 --> 05:04.740
-Elle.
-Greenaway.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.787
Highest number of solved cases
in Seattle three years running.

05:07.790 --> 05:09.872
Speciality in sex offender cases.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.377
-Not bad.
-Well, I'm the unit liaison.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.281
My speciality is untangling
bureaucratic knots.

05:15.290 --> 05:17.997
You'll probably be talking to me a lot.
My door is always open.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.410
Mostly because I'm never in my office.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.071
So just call me on my cell. Okay?
We'll talk.

05:23.620 --> 05:26.453
-Did you watch it?
-Yeah. I think everybody should see it.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.530
BAU team, can you meet me
in the conference room, please?

05:28.540 --> 05:30.496
I need to show you something.

05:31.620 --> 05:32.917
This is from the Phoenix office.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.957
Bradshaw College in Tempe.
Six fires in seven months.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.077
Who recorded it?
J]: A student with a digital camcorder.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.537
He was watching a fire in the building
across from their dorm.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.167
The other person you'll see
is his roommate,

05:43.170 --> 05:45.070
20-year-old Matthew Rowland.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.371
What the... This is crazy.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.029
Hey, Matt, get over here,
you gotta see this.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.531
-The building's on fire.
-Bro! You getting this?

05:52.540 --> 05:53.700
Is that the kid?

05:53.710 --> 05:55.166
Yeah, that's him.

05:55.170 --> 05:56.990
Nah, relax, man.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.285
There's always fires during rush week.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.030
Yeah, but that's pretty big.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.577
What is it?

06:02.580 --> 06:05.117
I don't know,
but it's coming underneath the door.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.032
-Is someone in the hallway?
-Hey, someone's trying to get in.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.871
Hey, man,
you should get away from there.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.872
-Oh, my God. It smells like gas.
-It's kind of starting to...

06:12.880 --> 06:14.780
Oh, my God, man!

06:14.790 --> 06:16.701
Put me out!

06:16.710 --> 06:19.247
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.615
Einstein once said,

06:59.620 --> 07:03.169
"Imagination is more important
than knowledge.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.536
"Knowledge is limited.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.913
"Imagination encircles the world."

07:08.920 --> 07:11.616
There are two common_stressors
for a serial arsonIst.

07:11.620 --> 07:13.872
Loss of job, loss of love.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.201
When was the first fire set?
-March.

07:16.210 --> 07:17.495
The next one was in May.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.161
And the third one
wasn't until September.

07:19.170 --> 07:20.990
Then two weeks later,
there were three in one night.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.571
He's speeding up.
Fires are closer together.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.878
Hey, Reid, you got a statistic
on arsonists?

07:25.880 --> 07:29.372
Eighty-two percent are white males
between 17 and 27.

07:29.380 --> 07:32.998
Female arsonists are far less likely,
their motive typically being revenge.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.070
Sounds like our boy's a student.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.376
Oh, don't be so sure.

07:38.170 --> 07:41.958
You rely too much on precedent,
you never allow for the unexpected.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.327
If he went from setting one fire to three
in two weeks' time...

07:45.330 --> 07:46.740
Rapid escalation.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.536
He's gone from the power
to damage a building

07:48.540 --> 07:50.701
to something far more satisfying.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.071
The power over life and death.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.167
Who we talking to first?

07:56.170 --> 07:58.206
Dean of Students,
Ellen Turner.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.667
Bradshaw College
TEMPE, ARIZONA

08:10.750 --> 08:11.910
No badges.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.286
I don't want to satisfy
the UnSub's need for attention

08:14.290 --> 08:16.497
by letting him know
he got the FBI here.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.990
Try not to look official.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.076
Try to look less official.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.377
Obviously I'd rather be meeting you
under different circumstances.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.075
This is Fire Inspector Zhang.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.116
This morning
the chemistry department reported

08:29.120 --> 08:32.419
several bottles of highly
flammable chemicals missing.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.615
I'm prepared to evacuate this campus.
Thank you.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.201
That brings with it its own problems.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.246
You might evacuate
the arsonist as well.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.821
When the case goes unsolved,
the campus is re-opened,

08:40.830 --> 08:42.161
but the fires start up again.

08:42.170 --> 08:44.320
Wait, Hotch, Gideon.
Hold on a second.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.161
_ You said_ _
the chemicals went mIssmg today.

08:46.170 --> 08:48.821
It says here that one of the previous
fires was set with diesel fuel

08:48.830 --> 08:50.786
that disappeared
from the grounds-keeping facility.

08:50.790 --> 08:53.532
How long after it disappeared
was the fire set?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.206
One day.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.285
He's holding to a pattern?

08:59.290 --> 09:01.827
Who's to say
the next fire won't be today?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.160
Door was locked.

09:11.170 --> 09:12.876
Matthew Rowland
and his roommate watched

09:12.880 --> 09:14.950
as the doorknob
turned against the lock.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.200
But the UnSub couldn't get in.

09:16.210 --> 09:19.532
So he pours the accelerant
into the room from the hallway.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.286
Which means he couldn't see the fire.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.951
But he could hear
Matthew Rowland screaming.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.996
Yeah, but not for long.
He would have left quickly.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.707
-Yeah, to avoid being spotted.
-Doesn't make sense.

09:28.710 --> 09:31.452
Pyromania as a mental disorder
may just be a simple myth,

09:31.460 --> 09:32.745
but we do know from precedent

09:32.750 --> 09:36.493
that serial arsonists derive pleasure
from pathological fire-setting.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.956
Sex and power.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.912
But a serial arsonist wouldn't just
set a fire and walk away.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.706
He needs to experience it.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.497
So why would he set a fire
he couldn't watch?

09:47.830 --> 09:50.162
They turned the water off
just before the fire.

09:50.170 --> 09:54.163
The last _three were set with these.
Two devrces, srmultaneous Ignition.

09:54.170 --> 09:56.786
There was no device used
on Matthew Rowland.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.451
UnSub set that one manually?

10:00.380 --> 10:01.574
He wanted to be there.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.707
Not necessarily.

10:03.710 --> 10:07.532
If the target was Matthew Rowland,
then why set the other two fires?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.167
Motives for arson are relatively simple.

10:09.170 --> 10:13.072
There's vandalism, crime concealment,
political statement, profit...

10:13.080 --> 10:14.240
And revenge.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.286
We interviewed
Matthew Rowland's roommate.

10:16.290 --> 10:19.077
He said Matthew was very well liked.
No reason for revenge.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.163
-What about vandalism?
-No, the fires are too sophisticated.

10:22.170 --> 10:23.785
And if he's trying to make
a political statement,

10:23.790 --> 10:25.326
he's not being too clear about it.

10:25.330 --> 10:28.163
There's an underlying strategy
mmsmm.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.240
Matthew, fire-fighters, injured victims.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.990
To the UnSub
they're not people, they're...

10:32.000 --> 10:33.820
They're just more like...

10:33.830 --> 10:35.036
Chess pieces.

10:36.580 --> 10:37.786
Exactly.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.325
All right.

10:46.170 --> 10:49.378
I want to set a dormitory on fire.
Where would I start?

10:57.500 --> 10:58.876
In the basement.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.990
The upper levels would be fuel.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.576
Then why did I start on the third floor?

11:08.040 --> 11:09.371
Oh, God!

11:15.540 --> 11:18.703
Because it wasn't the building
I wanted to set on fire.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.167
The timer sets the road flare,

11:21.170 --> 11:24.571
which then lights the chemical mixture
inside the canister.

11:24.580 --> 11:25.740
Simple.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.075
Yet sophisticated in its simplicity.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.991
. _ I mean _ _
there 5 a meticulous construction to it.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.572
Chemical accelerant
could mean chemistry student.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.912
Could also mean chemistry professor.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.069
Mmm-mmm.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.320
I say student.

11:38.620 --> 11:39.871
You need self-confidence

11:39.880 --> 11:43.953
to lecture in front of a classroom
full of 30 college kids.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.246
Arsonists are socially incompetent.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.997
This guy, he doesn't go on dates,
he doesn't go to parties,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.742
he doesn't feel comfortable
in front of groups.

11:55.330 --> 11:58.322
-And of course he's a total psychopath.
-Of course.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.320
You think
we'll get a lead from the hotline?

12:01.330 --> 12:02.456
No.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.452
If you don't mind my asking,
why then did you set up the number?

12:05.460 --> 12:08.076
Well, serial arsonists
enjoy manipulating authorities.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.071
They like to communicate,
explain themselves.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.457
I'm not waiting to hear
from a tipster or witness.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.872
-You're waiting to hear from him.
-Yeah.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.951
Now, the evacuation process...

12:24.750 --> 12:27.162
All right. Office hours.
I have my own homework to do.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.741
Thank you, Professor Wallace.
-No problem.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.826
We don't want a stampede
on our hands

12:39.830 --> 12:42.788
because the exits out of the campus
block so quickly.

12:42.790 --> 12:46.374
Now we have staging areas
and we must utilize every possible...

12:46.670 --> 12:47.910
Agent Gideon?

13:06.500 --> 13:07.740
Agent Gideon?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.070
Agent Gideon?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.741
Everybody out of the building! Go!

13:17.750 --> 13:19.957
-What is it?
-Look out!

13:20.460 --> 13:22.951
Clear the whole building!
Clear it! Move!

13:37.540 --> 13:39.917
I'm on fire!

13:39.920 --> 13:41.876
Help me! Help me!

13:54.170 --> 13:56.206
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

13:59.500 --> 14:03.823
Gideon! Get out of there! Let's go!

14:03.830 --> 14:06.458
Wait, Morgan!
There's somebody in there!

14:09.170 --> 14:11.991
Come on, Gideon! Move! Move!

14:12.000 --> 14:13.615
Keep moving, people.

14:19.580 --> 14:23.368
-Get off of me! It was a teacher.
-Just let it go!

14:23.790 --> 14:26.167
He's already dead. Let it go.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.780
He might be here watching.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.030
-Elle.
-Yeah.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.873
-Take pictures. As many as you can.
-You got it.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.919
-The professor's name was Wallace?
-It's a terrible loss.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.036
He was one of those teachers.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.741
He knew how to make a difference.

15:23.880 --> 15:28.078
Gideon, we've got police and security
interviewing everyone in that building.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.571
How long will it take to finish
evacuating the campus?

15:30.580 --> 15:33.071
This is a college
of 10,000 students and faculty.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.911
Well, there's another problem
with evacuating.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.491
You mean, we might accelerate
the UnSub's timeline.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.911
Let's round everybody up.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.917
Dean Turner? Hi, I'm Jeremy.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.821
I'm one of the research assistants
at the science department.

15:53.830 --> 15:56.913
We were talking and we'd like to help.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.706
The best thing you can do right now
is just stay...

15:58.710 --> 16:00.325
We know how he did it.

16:05.670 --> 16:08.491
We've been at this all night
and we got nothing.

16:10.460 --> 16:12.246
Look at these expressions.

16:13.420 --> 16:17.709
We got fear, a touch of horror,
even a little bit of panic.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.246
But where's the guy getting off?

16:20.250 --> 16:22.571
When asked about his motives,
Peter Dinsdale said,

16:22.580 --> 16:25.959
"I _am_devoted to fire.
Fire is my master."

16:27.880 --> 16:30.030
Okay, so who is our boy's master?

16:30.830 --> 16:32.786
Ten-thousand-plus students,

16:40.170 --> 16:43.116
. and one. . .
has a serious fascmation With fire.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.912
Fire-starting is one third
of the homicidal triad,

16:48.580 --> 16:52.823
an early predictor of adult
disassociative criminal behavior.

16:52.830 --> 16:56.209
If we looked in his childhood,
we'd probably find all three.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.741
Bed-wetting
and cruelty to animals.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.116
Absent or abusive father,
trouble with the opposite sex,

17:03.120 --> 17:04.951
chronic low self-esteem.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.450
MO will be dynamic.

17:07.330 --> 17:10.493
Evolving. As fire-setting escalates,
they thrive on panic, fear.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.991
It's just standard profile
of a serial arsonist.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.742
-Based on hundreds of interviews.
-Based on precedent.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.822
Everything the UnSub should be
according to research.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.497
-But we're off_ the mark.
-Because of two missmg elements.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.412
Sex and power. The two motives
that drive a serial arsonist.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.570
And without them,
we do not have a profile.

17:40.330 --> 17:41.820
Whoa! Hey!

17:42.620 --> 17:45.669
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I just... I'm campus patrol.

17:45.670 --> 17:48.241
-I'm supposed to ask for your ID.
-Sure.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.207
One of those FBI guys.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.240
Like a profiler, right?

18:02.250 --> 18:03.535
Like, one look at a crime scene,

18:03.540 --> 18:06.953
you can tell
what kind of shampoo a killer uses?

18:08.620 --> 18:11.418
-You sound skeptical.
-Maybe a little.

18:12.380 --> 18:15.952
Your girlfriend thinks
you're gonna break up with her.

18:16.620 --> 18:20.078
-You're kidding, right?
-You keep adjusting your necklace.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.287
That tells me _
you're not used to wearing one,

18:22.290 --> 18:26.169
or somebody else probably
bought it for you, bought it recently.

18:26.170 --> 18:29.162
And the Chinese symbol on it means
"Forever Yours".

18:31.620 --> 18:33.781
Take care of yourself, all right?

18:41.210 --> 18:45.499
Reid, since you're more their age,
why don't you do the talking?

18:50.380 --> 18:54.248
Hi guys.
My name is Doctor Spencer Reid.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.959
I am an agent with the BAU,

18:57.960 --> 19:00.576
Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI,

19:00.580 --> 19:04.994
which, it used to be called the BSU,
the Behavioral Science Unit,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.285
but not anymore.

19:06.290 --> 19:08.201
They changed it to the BAU.

19:08.210 --> 19:09.370
It's part of the NCAVC,

19:09.380 --> 19:11.325
the National Center
for the Analysis of Violent Crime,

19:11.330 --> 19:14.959
which is also part of this thing
called the CIRG,

19:14.960 --> 19:17.281
the Critical Incident
Response Group and...

19:17.290 --> 19:20.953
What he's trying to say is,
we'd love to know how you can help us.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.576
May I, please? Thank you.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.205
See this?

19:29.210 --> 19:31.451
Drill a hole in the side,
fill it with gasoline,

19:31.460 --> 19:33.246
or whatever is good and flammable,

19:33.250 --> 19:35.241
turn the light on, boom.

19:37.170 --> 19:40.458
-That is what went down, didn't it?
-This stuff's all over the Net.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.322
Wanna know how to make a Molotov
cocktail that sets itself on fire?

19:46.000 --> 19:50.619
Potassium, sulphur, and normal sugar.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.609
Sugan

19:52.620 --> 19:55.248
-Sugar, which is...
-Not exactly plutonium.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.572
Sugar from the supermarket.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.110
But you don't need to be
a chem major to know that.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.281
Do you think it's a chem student?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.201
You wanna know what I think?

20:07.500 --> 20:11.459
I think it would be a good time
to take the semester off.

20:20.540 --> 20:23.998
00 pm.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.956
So what are you still doing here?

20:25.960 --> 20:28.326
I can't leave. We've all got projects.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.201
You know how to solve
the three-body problem?

20:31.210 --> 20:33.246
Computing the mutual
gravitational interaction

20:33.250 --> 20:35.320
between the earth, sun and moon?

20:35.750 --> 20:38.457
Do you have any idea how many
people called me today

20:38.460 --> 20:41.918
with absolute certainty that our arsonist
is a fire-fighter?

20:41.920 --> 20:44.115
I'm like, "Yeah, I saw Backdraft."

20:44.120 --> 20:45.997
Let me call you right back.

20:48.250 --> 20:51.162
This came into the hotline
about five minutes ago.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.379
You've reached the FBI Tip Hotline
for the Bradshaw College fires.

20:58.170 --> 21:00.821
Karen, I do this for Karen.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.707
Karen, I do this for Karen.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.490
Play it again.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.491
The _call came from the office
right next to Wallace's

21:12.500 --> 21:15.037
five minutes before the fire was started.

21:15.330 --> 21:16.570
Play it again.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.417
Karen, I do this for Karen.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.660
Again. Louder.

21:26.830 --> 21:29.537
Karen, I do this for Karen.

21:30.170 --> 21:31.319
What is it?

21:31.830 --> 21:33.878
I'm not sure.
There's something about it.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.745
Is this tape clean?

21:35.750 --> 21:37.786
Yeah, I can put it
through some more audio filters.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.701
Look, we need as close to the real
voice as you can get,

21:39.710 --> 21:41.109
and anything that might be
in the background.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.280
Can you do it?

21:42.290 --> 21:43.450
Okay, you know how on Star Trek,

21:43.460 --> 21:45.917
when Captain Kirk asks McCoy
to do something totally impossible

21:45.920 --> 21:48.491
and McCoy says, "Damn it, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker"?

21:48.500 --> 21:50.616
Hey, what are you telling me

21:50.620 --> 21:51.996
No, I'm saying I'm not a doctor.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.377
That's my girl.

21:59.710 --> 22:04.113
These are all the women on campus
with the first name Karen.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.785
Lot of Karens.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.202
What if the UnSub
is one of the students leaving?

22:18.210 --> 22:19.825
No, he's not done yet.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.326
He's not going anywhere.

22:24.330 --> 22:27.072
-Keep thinking.
-You mean, outside the box?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.706
That's what_
Morgan's always telling me.

22:28.710 --> 22:31.076
He says that's why
I can never beat you at chess.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.877
Well, he's probably right.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.667
But I mean, in this situation,
what exactly is the box?

22:36.670 --> 22:39.207
The standard profile
of a serial arsonist.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.162
If everything you know goes in the box,
what's left?

22:42.170 --> 22:44.161
What you don't know. The unknown.

22:44.170 --> 22:47.378
Sometimes you have to get creative,
even if you think it's utterly unlikely.

22:47.380 --> 22:49.780
You have to think of things
nobody else thought of.

22:49.790 --> 22:51.075
Like a stutter.

22:51.540 --> 22:52.780
Yeah, exactly.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.030
Thank you, Karen.

22:58.620 --> 22:59.996
Karen number seven.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.037
You know, there's got to be
a faster way to do this.

23:03.580 --> 23:05.116
How about we just
change the first question to,

23:05.120 --> 23:08.203
"Have you recently dated
a homicidal pyromaniac?"

23:08.210 --> 23:09.825
Speaking of questions,

23:13.250 --> 23:14.706
Nope. You?

23:15.620 --> 23:18.612
I know that
embarrassment makes a stutter worse.

23:18.620 --> 23:19.746
And that when you're flustered

23:19.750 --> 23:23.163
it's more difficult to control
the articulatory musculature of the face.

23:23.170 --> 23:24.910
You sound like Reid.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.741
You did not just say that.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.036
Obviously somebody's been doing
their homework.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.577
I still have no idea
what causes a stutter.

23:34.210 --> 23:36.166
Karen! Number eight.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.168
Hey! I didn't scare you again, did I?

24:10.380 --> 24:13.452
Sorry, this is one of the buildings
on my patrol.

24:13.460 --> 24:16.702
I was just looking at the board.
"Three-body problem."

24:19.170 --> 24:21.877
-You know what it means?
-No, no idea.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.108
It's physics.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.782
It's one of the great
mathematical mysteries.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.615
You broke up with her.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.530
No more necklace.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.247
Yeah, I kind of wanted
to date someone else.

24:34.330 --> 24:36.616
-What's her name?
-Brian.

24:38.380 --> 24:39.495
Oh.

24:40.460 --> 24:43.452
Well, that's...
That's a pretty good reason.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.825
-She take it all right?
-Yeah.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.616
Yeah, other than telling me
that homosexuality is a sin

24:50.620 --> 24:53.373
and that I'm going to
incur the wrath of God.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.285
Wrath of God.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.952
Okay, gorgeous. I've put this thing
through every audio filter I've got.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.951
There's only one thing
I can tell you for sure.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.747
This guy isn't saying Karen.
It's more like "Ka-rown."

25:13.750 --> 25:15.741
Garcia, what the hell is "Ka-rown?"

25:15.750 --> 25:18.878
If I figure it out, does it earn me
a night of passionate lovemaking?

25:18.880 --> 25:20.279
Most definitely, sweetness.

25:20.290 --> 25:21.450
With Reid.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.281
Bye. Hey, Reid!

25:24.290 --> 25:26.702
Garcia says it's not Karen,
it's actually something more like...

25:26.710 --> 25:27.950
-Charown.
-Charown?

25:27.960 --> 25:30.110
That's Hebrew.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.418
Yeah.

25:32.420 --> 25:34.240
The motive is now religious?

25:34.250 --> 25:37.117
Well, you know in a lot of religions,
God is related to fire.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.281
Well, Agni is fire in Hinduism.
-Yeah, purging with ﬁre.

25:39.290 --> 25:41.246
And the Jews see God
as a pillar of fire.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.377
And Christians worship God
as a consuming fire.

25:43.380 --> 25:44.824
Okay, so we're looking for
a theology major.

25:44.830 --> 25:46.957
Maybe he's punishing
the other students for their sins.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.075
I don't want this.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.036
_ What's the most
Sinful place on campus?

25:50.040 --> 25:52.497
Come on, Elle, when I was in college,
it was everywhere.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.286
-Fraternity

25:54.790 --> 25:57.111
No, because that's not consistent
with the previous targets.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.917
What about the idea
of baptism by fire?

25:58.920 --> 26:01.206
Aren't we all supposed to be tested
through fire in Revelations?

26:01.210 --> 26:02.370
Look, it's good, it's good.

26:02.380 --> 26:04.166
But, listen, please
do not jump to conclusions.

26:04.170 --> 26:05.410
Religion might be a part of it,

26:05.420 --> 26:07.320
but it's not necessarily
the prime compulsion.

26:07.330 --> 26:09.878
Gideon, rush to conclusions,
jump to conclusions, who cares?

26:09.880 --> 26:12.371
-We are running out of time.
-Compulsion.

26:13.710 --> 26:15.416
What the... This is crazy!

26:15.420 --> 26:17.160
Hey, Matt, get over here,
you gotta see this.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.741
-The building's on fire.
-Bro! You getting this?

26:19.750 --> 26:21.490
-Two of them.
-Man, get out of the way.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.491
Nah, relax, man.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.876
There's always fires during rush week.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.995
Yeah, but that's pretty big.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.160
You know, it's...

26:27.170 --> 26:29.661
What is it?

26:29.670 --> 26:32.036
I don't know,
but it's coming underneath the door.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.077
-Is someone in the hallway?
-Hey, someone's trying to get in.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.536
Hey man,
you should get away from there.

26:36.540 --> 26:39.168
-Oh, my God. It smells like gas.
-It's kind of starting to...

26:39.170 --> 26:41.115
Oh, my God, man!

26:41.120 --> 26:42.667
Put me out!

26:42.670 --> 26:43.819
Hold on! Oh, my God!

26:43.830 --> 26:45.411
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

26:46.330 --> 26:47.877
Hold on, man!

27:06.380 --> 27:07.995
Outside the box.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.700
Keep thinking.

27:20.580 --> 27:21.990
It's like chess.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.618
Don't look at just the next move.
Try to look three moves ahead.

27:31.290 --> 27:33.201
What the... This is crazy!

27:33.210 --> 27:34.996
Hey, Matt, get over here,
you gotta see this.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.412
-The building's on fire.
-Bro! You getting this?

27:37.420 --> 27:39.285
-Two of them.
-Man, get out of the way!

27:39.290 --> 27:41.451
Nah, relax, man.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.700
There's always fires during rush week.

27:42.710 --> 27:43.916
Yeah, but that's pretty big.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.035
You know it's...

27:45.040 --> 27:47.747
What is it?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.161
What the hell is that?

27:50.170 --> 27:52.707
What is it?

27:52.710 --> 27:53.995
I don't know.

27:55.670 --> 27:57.786
There's always fires during rush week.

27:57.790 --> 27:59.075
What the hell is that?

27:59.080 --> 28:01.571
What is it?

28:01.580 --> 28:02.820
I don't know.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.536
Three times.

28:52.830 --> 28:56.288
00.

28:58.420 --> 29:00.490
I know why the profiles never fit.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.741
You were right to tell Morgan
not to rely on precedent.

29:02.750 --> 29:05.742
The fires thus far have been
completely task-oriented.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.615
So once they're set,
the UnSub is done?

29:07.620 --> 29:08.746
Exactly.

29:08.750 --> 29:10.661
The UnSub is not _
a cla55ical serial arsonist.

29:10.670 --> 29:12.285
He's someone who uses fire

29:12.290 --> 29:13.951
because of a completely
different disorder.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.997
-Which is?
-An extreme manifestation of OCD,

29:17.000 --> 29:18.877
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.916
He does everything in threes.

29:21.420 --> 29:24.287
And if I'm right,
he'll have to kill again.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.707
There's a form of OCD
called scrupulosity.

29:31.710 --> 29:33.575
Religious obsession
and compulsion.

29:33.580 --> 29:36.822
An obsessive fear of committing sin
which creates so much anxiety

29:36.830 --> 29:39.458
that he's compelled to do something
to ease that anxiety.

29:39.460 --> 29:40.950
Like setting fires.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.282
-Where's the behavioral evidence?
-Right here.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.996
All right, remember the night
of the three fires?

29:47.000 --> 29:50.288
We_saw the door knob
turning against the lock.

29:52.330 --> 29:54.036
But he's not trying to get in.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.668
He's compelled
to turn the door knob three times.

29:56.670 --> 30:01.118
Well, what about the fires?
The first ones were single fires.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.708
If the UnSub was OCD,
shouldn't they have all been in threes?

30:04.710 --> 30:07.747
They were in threes.
In a trinity of threes.

30:08.170 --> 30:12.709
00 pm. Third day. Third month.

30:12.710 --> 30:16.953
It's that convergence of threes that
causes the overwhelming anxiety.

30:16.960 --> 30:20.498
Obsessive-compulsives ease the
anxiety by performing the compulsion.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.956
What about the other fires?

30:21.960 --> 30:24.781
-Professor Wallace?
-Office number three.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.952
I checked for more patterns of threes.
His class was on Tuesdays.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.166
Third day of the week.

30:30.170 --> 30:33.617
Matthew Rowland was in that class.
It was his third class of the day.

30:33.620 --> 30:34.917
If we looked into each of the fires,

30:34.920 --> 30:37.411
we'd find a lot of patterns
having to do with threes.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.207
Because our minds are incredibly
adept at seeking out patterns.

30:40.210 --> 30:42.826
But to the UnSub,
once that pattern hits...

30:42.830 --> 30:44.206
Bam! He sets a fire.

30:44.580 --> 30:48.209
If the target was always people,
why did no one die in the first few fires?

30:48.210 --> 30:51.498
They were failures,
up until Matthew Rowland.

30:56.420 --> 30:59.412
-What is it?
-I think I know who it might be.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.991
And it's not a he, it's a she.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.411
Clara Hayes.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.530
A chemistry student.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.030
I'll get you her records now.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.247
First get campus security out
and find her.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.707
She could set her next fire
within hours.

31:14.710 --> 31:17.497
Okay, got it.
Her apartment's off-campus.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.786
But how is he sure it's this girl?

31:19.790 --> 31:21.109
When I was talking to her
and her classmates,

31:21.120 --> 31:22.280
I noticed something.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.326
A ring on her finger
and she kept turning it.

31:24.330 --> 31:25.661
-At intervals?
-Of three.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.668
And she counted off the ingredients
of a light bulb bomb.

31:30.670 --> 31:35.164
Potassium, sulphur, and normal sugar.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.208
-Sugar. Sugar...
-And the word sugar.

31:40.210 --> 31:41.950
Yeah, and then she kept repeating it.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.246
-Once she started, she couldn't stop.
-Yeah, it's palilalia.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.070
It's the involuntary repetition of words.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.207
Howard Hughes had it
when his OCD worsened.

31:48.210 --> 31:51.373
Clara and her classmates were working
on a project about gravitational pull.

31:51.380 --> 31:52.995
The three-body problem.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.285
No one in here.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.035
Clear.

32:12.120 --> 32:15.999
Oh, you gotta be kidding.
OCD? I'm thinking more like OMG.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.321
-OMG?
-"Oh, my God."

32:18.920 --> 32:22.879
"A fire is kindled in my anger,
and shall burn unto the lowest hell."

32:23.120 --> 32:24.610
Deuteronomy.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.373
"And again the fire of heaven
came down and killed them all."

32:27.380 --> 32:30.247
"I do this for Charon." That's Charon.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.997
That's the Greek mythological
ferryman of the dead.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.286
It's also the name
of Pluto's only moon.

32:36.290 --> 32:38.110
Paradise Lost.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.668
"Moloch, horrid King,

32:40.670 --> 32:44.322
"besmeared with blood
of human sacrifice, and parents' tears."

32:44.790 --> 32:47.247
Moloch was the demon sun god
of the Canaanites.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.956
In order to keep
from incurring his wrath,

32:48.960 --> 32:53.033
the people would sacrifice their
children to them by burning them alive.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.326
"Sixteen-year-old survives inferno.

32:57.330 --> 32:59.207
"The mother, Ellen Hayes,
called it a miracle.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.825
"My daughter was tested by God.

33:00.830 --> 33:03.788
"He tested my child
and she came through blessed."

33:03.790 --> 33:04.825
Look at the house number.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.416
Three-three-three.

33:09.170 --> 33:10.455
Hey, Morgan.

33:10.460 --> 33:13.782
-You know what magical thinking is?
-Obsessive thoughts.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.456
It's like a superstition.
It controls them.

33:16.460 --> 33:20.203
Like, "Step on a crack,
break your mother's back."

33:21.500 --> 33:23.786
Except she actually believes it.

33:23.790 --> 33:26.076
Yeah, God tested her with fire.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.616
And now, when three threes...

33:30.500 --> 33:33.378
Three threes show up
around another person...

33:34.120 --> 33:35.951
God tells her to test them.

33:40.790 --> 33:42.371
Security's checking
the science building.

33:42.380 --> 33:43.779
Well, where else would she be?

33:43.790 --> 33:46.372
We need to find
the next pattern of threes.

33:46.960 --> 33:48.575
Hey, Hotch.
We're looking, man.

33:48.580 --> 33:50.992
I don't think she would've left behind
a day planner that says,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.207
"Set Next Fire Here" written in it.

33:56.330 --> 33:59.037
Yeah, I understand...
Wait until you see this place.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.075
Morgan?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.370
I'll call you back.

34:09.670 --> 34:11.490
There must be
30 homemade bombs in here.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.615
Morgan, seal the building.

34:12.620 --> 34:14.076
Get everybody out of there
and walk away.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.570
We need to send our people
into every building,

34:15.580 --> 34:16.786
have them start pulling fire alarms.

34:16.790 --> 34:17.950
Okay. Okay.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.075
We need a map of the campus.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.240
We need to find anything
and everything

34:20.250 --> 34:21.410
having to do with the number three.

34:21.420 --> 34:24.287
-Where's the blueprint?
-Hell, no. I am not leaving.

34:24.290 --> 34:26.201
Look, I have too much to do.

34:26.210 --> 34:29.452
All right, I bought one of those
mini halon fire extinguishers.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.200
They started selling them
at the bookstore.

34:31.210 --> 34:32.996
It's pretty morbid, right?

34:33.540 --> 34:36.532
Hey, I'm about to get into an elevator,
so I'll probably lose you.

34:36.540 --> 34:38.030
All right, bye-bye.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.160
You got the science building?

35:12.170 --> 35:14.411
All the corridors and stairwells
are clear.

35:14.420 --> 35:17.457
The elevator close_ts chec_ked.
No elevators are in serwce.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.950
It's not gonna start.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.874
-Don't you have the key?
-I put it back on the hook in the office.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.531
Aren't you supposed to be able to hear
the Emergency Call button?

35:30.540 --> 35:31.996
Maybe it's broken.

35:35.710 --> 35:39.077
-Or turned off.
-I say we pry open the doors.

35:40.210 --> 35:43.373
You can't pry them all the way open.
It's a safety precaution.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.530
Maybe we can try yelling for help.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.660
That's the fire alarm.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.785
Jason, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.701
Clara Hayes is very likely
a good person.

36:00.710 --> 36:02.575
Someone who never wanted to do
anyone any harm,

36:02.580 --> 36:03.911
like any other rational person.

36:03.920 --> 36:06.491
But there's nothing rational about
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.287
Research suggests OCD
involves problems in communication

36:09.290 --> 36:11.827
between the frontal part of the brain
and the orbital cortex.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.616
Plus deeper structures,
the basal ganglia.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.826
You can't reason with her

36:14.830 --> 36:16.741
because you can't reason
with a physiological problem.

36:16.750 --> 36:19.822
She's not setting these fires because
she wants to, but because she has to.

36:19.830 --> 36:22.537
-What are you trying to say?
-Don't try to convince her to stop.

36:22.540 --> 36:24.496
Because you won't be able to.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.781
That's it

36:34.460 --> 36:37.167
I told you.
It's a built-in safety precaution.

36:38.290 --> 36:42.249
Help! Somebody help us! Hello!

36:42.920 --> 36:45.616
Somebody help us! Please!

36:45.620 --> 36:48.748
Somebody... We're trapped down here.
Somebody help us!

36:52.380 --> 36:53.665
Clara.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.491
-C|ara, thank God.
-It's all right.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.572
Clara, go back to the office
and get the elevator key.

36:59.580 --> 37:02.663
It's okay. I'm here to save you.

37:03.750 --> 37:06.241
Go get the key, Clara.
Go... The elevator key.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.956
-C|ara, get the key!
-C|ara! Clara, wait!

37:07.960 --> 37:10.030
-The key!
-Is this building on fire?

37:10.040 --> 37:11.166
Clara?

37:12.670 --> 37:13.819
Not yet.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.532
-It's clear up here. Anything?
-Nothing.

37:23.290 --> 37:25.497
No girl, no smoke, no fire.

37:26.500 --> 37:29.321
-Where did she go?
-Maybe she's getting the key.

37:30.460 --> 37:31.700
I don't know.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.324
What is she doing?

37:41.380 --> 37:43.075
Someone coming to help?

37:43.380 --> 37:46.611
I'm here to help. I'm here to save you.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.496
God chose you.

37:52.330 --> 37:54.207
Chose you, chose you.

37:54.210 --> 37:55.529
Clara?

37:55.540 --> 37:59.112
-Father. Son.
-Oh, my God!

37:59.120 --> 38:01.076
Clara. Clara? Listen to me.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.616
-C|ara...
-C|ara, listen...

38:02.620 --> 38:03.951
It's gasoline!

38:09.580 --> 38:12.208
Clara, listen!
-Oh, God! Clara, no!

38:13.620 --> 38:15.747
Security's sure that they've cleared
the science building?

38:15.750 --> 38:17.286
The guards made sure
all the floors are empty

38:17.290 --> 38:19.246
and no elevators are in service.

38:19.250 --> 38:22.162
00 pm.

38:22.460 --> 38:25.167
Clara?
GIRL 2: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

38:25.170 --> 38:27.286
Clara Put it down, Clara!

38:27.290 --> 38:29.667
Focus on the girl.

38:30.880 --> 38:33.326
She was failing out.
This was gonna be her last semester.

38:33.330 --> 38:35.161
That's the stressor. What else?

38:35.170 --> 38:37.741
Let's see, she was a researcher
in the science building.

38:37.750 --> 38:40.241
We know that. They already
cleared the science building.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.878
The third floor of the science
building is under construction.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.108
I'm on my way.

38:49.330 --> 38:50.911
Clara! Please.
-C|ara!

38:51.620 --> 38:53.531
Clara, you don't have to
do this, all right?

38:53.540 --> 38:55.451
Somebody help us!

38:56.250 --> 38:58.070
I have to do this.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.958
You know it's not rational, Clara.
You were trying to tell me.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.281
God chose me to be tested.

39:03.290 --> 39:05.110
-And now he's chosen them.
-Do something!

39:05.120 --> 39:08.032
If I don't do this,
something terrible will happen.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.951
What's gonna happen, Clara An earthquake?

39:09.960 --> 39:12.110
You know this isn't rational.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.611
-I know, I know, I know.
-Then resist.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.491
-I can't!
-C|ara?

39:17.500 --> 39:20.162
-C|ara, listen to me.
-Oh, my God! Clara! Don't!

39:20.170 --> 39:23.617
They must be tested. God's wrath...

39:24.080 --> 39:25.957
Clara, you told me
it was a chemistry student.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.076
You left the message about Charon.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.208
-Charon, Charon, Moloch.
-You wanna stop.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.957
-Father, Son...
-C|ara.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.075
...Holy Ghost.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.038
Clara, stop!
-God chose them.

39:47.620 --> 39:50.168
I thought you said
not to reason with her?

39:50.710 --> 39:52.200
Get us out of here!

39:55.330 --> 39:57.161
You know, I figured it out.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.325
The stutter.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.700
You know
why the Footpath Killer stuttered?

40:06.710 --> 40:10.111
When you and Hotch were
talking earlier, that's when I got it.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.247
_ He_ said
he was just trying to stall Clara.

40:12.250 --> 40:13.319
Right.

40:14.250 --> 40:15.990
Well, that's it, isn't it?

40:16.000 --> 40:19.413
The Footpath Killer.
You were just trying to stall him.

40:19.420 --> 40:23.072
You said, "I know why you stutter",
because you were buying time.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.536
You were stalling.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.532
But you don't really know
why he stuttered.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.701
-I don't?
-I looked it up. No one does.

40:35.790 --> 40:39.874
There are some_theorie_s
about a neurological ba5is.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.700
But they're just theories.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.747
What really happened
in the convenience store?

40:51.580 --> 40:53.992
I'll tell you
what I do know about a stutter.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.786
I know how to provoke one.

41:09.710 --> 41:10.870
Now the key.

41:48.880 --> 41:49.995
Thirteen.

41:53.710 --> 41:55.325
We only found six.

41:57.290 --> 41:59.167
-Are you impressed?
-Yeah.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.071
I didn't know you could count.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.321
Our profile said you'd be too stupid.

42:07.830 --> 42:10.412
We also said
you'd be a chronic bed-wetter.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.536
You take...

42:20.790 --> 42:22.075
What?

42:22.080 --> 42:24.913
The cam... The cam...

42:24.920 --> 42:26.376
I don't know what you're trying to say.

42:26.380 --> 42:32.956
You take the cam, the cam, the cam...

42:35.120 --> 42:36.280
I'm sorry.

42:36.290 --> 42:38.997
I have no_idea
what you're trying to say.

42:39.000 --> 42:43.494
You take... You take the cam...
The cam...

42:43.500 --> 42:44.706
Say it.

42:44.710 --> 42:47.452
The cam... The cam...

42:48.330 --> 42:49.661
Just spit it out.

42:49.670 --> 42:51.160
-Just...
-The cam...

42:57.500 --> 42:58.535
Come on!

43:05.120 --> 43:06.917
Faulkner once said,

43:06.920 --> 43:10.913
"Don't bother just to be better than
your contemporaries or predecessors,

43:10.920 --> 43:13.070
"try to be better than yourself."

43:16.210 --> 43:17.450
Check in three.

43:20.330 --> 43:21.490
Not bad.

43:31.790 --> 43:32.916
Checkmate.

43:36.750 --> 43:39.492
Don't worry. You're getting there.
