WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:04.104
We're certainly prepared
to go to trial.

00:04.137 --> 00:05.271
Don't misunderstand.

00:05.305 --> 00:07.173
You just don't think
you can win?

00:08.308 --> 00:10.010
It's not that we can't,

00:10.043 --> 00:13.514
but nobody's ever won
this type of suit before.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.348
There is a last-minute offer.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.752
It's likely just
to avoid trial, but...

00:20.153 --> 00:20.987
it's something.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.524
How much?

00:23.557 --> 00:26.326
It's, uh...

00:26.359 --> 00:27.460
$8,000.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.097
Eight thousand dollars?

00:31.131 --> 00:33.667
Is that the going rate
for manual rape these days?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.135
YOUNG: The thing is,

00:35.168 --> 00:38.872
this case isn't against
the church or the priest.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.541
It's against the fellow victim.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.408
It's against someone
who could have prevented it

00:42.442 --> 00:45.411
from happening to me,
and should have.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.147
FRUTT: Like I said,

00:47.180 --> 00:49.249
we're prepared to move forward,

00:49.282 --> 00:51.451
but we need you to be aware,

00:51.484 --> 00:53.687
we're not confident of victory.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.690
I'm not walking away
for $8,000.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.769
(music playing)

01:52.152 --> 01:54.988
BALL: We saw the article
in the newspaper, um,

01:55.021 --> 01:57.758
on the fat woman singing,
uh, and we thought...

01:57.791 --> 01:59.993
maybe you're like
the specialist in nuisance law,

02:00.026 --> 02:01.467
which is--
that's why we're here.

02:01.768 --> 02:04.037
Uh, but you're suing her?

02:04.070 --> 02:05.105
BALL: Yeah.
That's correct.

02:05.138 --> 02:06.540
She's my neighbor.

02:06.573 --> 02:08.441
And, uh--

02:08.473 --> 02:10.143
well, neither one of us
could afford a big trial.

02:10.175 --> 02:13.847
And we'd heard about this, uh,

02:13.880 --> 02:17.050
alternative dispute resolution,
where, uh,

02:17.083 --> 02:20.153
a lawyer, you know,
kind of, decides.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.488
You know,
like a ref or something.

02:22.523 --> 02:23.857
It actually
isn't that simple.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.692
Each of you would have
to be represented

02:25.726 --> 02:27.227
by your own attorney.

02:27.961 --> 02:29.563
Oh.

02:30.897 --> 02:32.332
Well, have you
got another one here?

02:36.102 --> 02:37.571
DONNELL: I thought this
was supposed to settle.

02:37.604 --> 02:38.839
They lowballed us.

02:38.872 --> 02:39.706
You can't try this.

02:39.740 --> 02:41.775
The jury will laugh at you.

02:42.676 --> 02:44.244
Why the hell didn't you
just sue the church?

02:44.277 --> 02:45.178
We did. We got lumped

02:45.211 --> 02:46.913
into a class action on that.

02:46.947 --> 02:48.615
We're pursuing
this defendant separately.

02:48.649 --> 02:49.850
Why, because
he's a deep pocket?

02:49.883 --> 02:50.851
YOUNG: Bobby.

02:50.884 --> 02:54.187
This is a dog, Eugene,
and you know it.

02:54.220 --> 02:56.523
A victim has no duty
to another victim.

02:56.557 --> 02:57.624
It's tort law 101.

02:57.658 --> 02:59.192
Without duty,
there's no breach.

02:59.225 --> 03:01.267
Perhaps you'd like to argue
for the other side.

03:01.301 --> 03:02.636
The other side,
at least, has merits.

03:02.669 --> 03:04.404
Yes. Which has always been
a prerequisite

03:04.437 --> 03:05.606
for taking a case here.

03:05.639 --> 03:06.439
All right.

03:06.472 --> 03:07.974
(doors opens)

03:08.008 --> 03:09.576
HATCHER: Walk up.

03:09.610 --> 03:10.511
I took the last one.
I'm in trial.

03:10.977 --> 03:11.845
Jamie.

03:11.878 --> 03:12.879
Excellent.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.985
I'm sorry. None of you
find her too perky?

03:19.620 --> 03:20.654
To answer your question,

03:20.687 --> 03:22.255
a civil case should have merit

03:22.288 --> 03:23.990
before you take it
on a contingency,

03:24.024 --> 03:26.292
for God's sakes,
which you know.

03:28.028 --> 03:29.395
I think another bias
is in play here.

03:29.429 --> 03:30.797
FRUTT: Bobby.
Excuse me?

03:30.831 --> 03:32.365
Are you talking
about my bias or yours?

03:32.398 --> 03:33.499
Eugene.
YOUNG: The jury

03:33.534 --> 03:34.635
will just laugh at us?

03:34.668 --> 03:35.736
The man was raped.

03:35.769 --> 03:37.203
What kind of bias
allows for a person

03:37.237 --> 03:38.905
to see that as nothing?

03:39.305 --> 03:41.542
You know what?
Good luck with your case.

03:41.575 --> 03:43.043
I hope you win.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.314
(door closes)

03:49.683 --> 03:52.686
I mean, it's my apartment.

03:52.719 --> 03:55.522
I should be allowed to make
ordinary household noises.

03:55.556 --> 03:56.623
I see.

03:56.657 --> 03:58.525
So you both
went to Lindsay Dole.

03:58.559 --> 03:59.726
Yes. And she said

03:59.760 --> 04:01.602
we needed separate attorneys,

04:01.635 --> 04:03.303
and sent me over here.

04:03.336 --> 04:04.571
Excellent.

04:04.605 --> 04:06.840
And the nature
of the household noises?

04:06.873 --> 04:08.875
Lovemaking.

04:10.744 --> 04:11.678
Lovemaking?

04:11.712 --> 04:13.179
Yes.

04:13.213 --> 04:15.181
I guess...

04:15.215 --> 04:17.718
I'm a little vocal.
(chuckles)

04:17.750 --> 04:19.853
I can't believe I'm saying this,
Zeus in heaven.

04:20.486 --> 04:21.187
So...

04:21.221 --> 04:23.289
FARCHER: And, see, Albert,

04:23.323 --> 04:26.226
he and I used to be a couple.

04:26.259 --> 04:29.563
So it's difficult for him
to hear noises

04:29.596 --> 04:31.598
that used to only get
made for him.

04:32.332 --> 04:33.199
Ah.

04:33.233 --> 04:36.202
I think that's
what this is really about.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.505
He's just trying
to stop me from making love.

04:40.173 --> 04:43.176
He's a very jealous man.

04:45.078 --> 04:48.014
I was 18 years old
at the time.

04:48.048 --> 04:50.684
I was having emotional problems
at school...

04:50.717 --> 04:52.653
and at home.

04:52.686 --> 04:54.688
And I knew that Walter
was being counseled by him,

04:54.721 --> 04:56.289
so I thought that
I would try it.

04:56.322 --> 04:58.391
Walter Beck
was a friend of yours?

04:58.424 --> 05:00.060
My best friend.

05:00.093 --> 05:01.267
In fact,
he was the only friend

05:01.301 --> 05:03.003
that I confided my problems to.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.538
It was because
of this I learned

05:04.571 --> 05:06.640
that he was seeing
Father Brindle.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.442
And later you met
with this priest.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.611
GRAYSON: Yes.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.712
FRUTT: And what happened?

05:11.745 --> 05:12.546
GRAYSON: At first, he thought

05:12.579 --> 05:15.582
that I was suffering
from depression,

05:15.616 --> 05:19.285
and then he started to zoom in
on fear of intimacy,

05:19.319 --> 05:20.821
physical intimacy.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.424
FRUTT: And, at some point,
this went beyond talk.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.792
GRAYSON: Yes.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.661
After...

05:27.694 --> 05:28.729
a couple of months or so,

05:28.762 --> 05:30.363
he asked me...

05:30.396 --> 05:31.598
to take my clothes off,

05:32.465 --> 05:34.300
to be naked before God,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.903
and to lie down on a sofa

05:36.937 --> 05:38.605
that he had in his office.

05:39.305 --> 05:42.375
For the next several sessions,
I would talk...

05:42.408 --> 05:45.812
while naked.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.015
And, uh, then it began
to progress

05:49.049 --> 05:52.285
where he would lie down with me,

05:52.318 --> 05:54.087
clothed...

05:54.120 --> 05:56.056
and hold me,

05:56.089 --> 05:57.591
to help me...

05:57.624 --> 05:59.860
with my phobia
of physical intimacy,

05:59.893 --> 06:01.502
as he would put it.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.805
And then he would take off
his clothes

06:04.838 --> 06:08.575
and lie down next to me
naked as well.

06:08.609 --> 06:10.376
Soon after that,
he began to molest me.

06:12.278 --> 06:14.080
FRUTT: Arvin...

06:14.114 --> 06:16.683
did you ever talk
to Walter Beck about this?

06:17.483 --> 06:20.987
I didn't tell him specifically
what was happening,

06:21.021 --> 06:23.123
but I raised questions.

06:23.156 --> 06:26.259
I asked Walter how much
he trusted this priest,

06:26.292 --> 06:29.362
and Walter always spoke
incredibly highly of him.

06:29.395 --> 06:31.031
So you continued
to have sessions

06:31.064 --> 06:32.465
with father Brindle.

06:32.498 --> 06:33.499
GRAYSON: Yes.

06:34.367 --> 06:35.669
And then he began...

06:35.702 --> 06:38.004
to penetrate me...

06:38.038 --> 06:38.939
with his hands.

06:40.641 --> 06:42.442
FRUTT:
Did you ever tell anybody?

06:42.475 --> 06:43.276
GRAYSON: No.

06:43.309 --> 06:44.578
Why not?

06:44.611 --> 06:47.113
Embarrassment...

06:47.147 --> 06:49.983
shame, fear.
(sighs)

06:50.016 --> 06:52.853
He was a very
well-respected priest,

06:53.754 --> 06:55.689
and I thought perhaps
I was the only one,

06:55.722 --> 06:59.092
so I made a decision
to stay quiet.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.569
FRUTT: And then?

07:02.603 --> 07:04.938
GRAYSON: Then after
about a year...

07:04.971 --> 07:07.040
I stopped.

07:07.073 --> 07:09.710
My life went on.

07:09.743 --> 07:10.977
Certainly not well.

07:11.011 --> 07:13.714
For the next 20 some odd years,

07:13.747 --> 07:16.116
I tried to get those
sessions out of my mind,

07:17.818 --> 07:19.452
until the allegations came out

07:19.485 --> 07:20.721
that he had done it to others.

07:20.754 --> 07:23.256
And at that point,
you came forward?

07:23.890 --> 07:25.759
I joined a class action lawsuit

07:25.792 --> 07:29.162
against the church
and Father Brindle.

07:29.195 --> 07:32.799
And as I was reviewing
the pleadings,

07:32.833 --> 07:35.936
I came across the name
of an old friend of mine,

07:35.969 --> 07:36.970
Walter Beck.

07:38.038 --> 07:40.240
And I read
that he had been molested

07:40.273 --> 07:42.308
by the same priest...

07:42.342 --> 07:43.143
before me.

07:45.546 --> 07:46.880
He spoke so highly of him.

07:46.913 --> 07:50.083
He's the reason
I went to him.

07:50.116 --> 07:51.652
You let me walk into
that room...

07:51.685 --> 07:52.619
Objection.

07:52.653 --> 07:54.387
...knowing exactly

07:54.420 --> 07:55.355
what was waiting for me.

07:55.388 --> 07:56.923
Your Honor.
PENDER: Mr. Grayson,

07:56.957 --> 07:59.159
please don't address
the defendant, sir.

08:08.408 --> 08:09.810
A deposition?

08:09.843 --> 08:11.545
I would like to get
his account on record.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.679
That way...
DOLE: Jamie,

08:12.713 --> 08:14.648
this is just
a couple having a fight.

08:14.681 --> 08:15.882
Ex-couple.

08:15.916 --> 08:17.083
And I couldn't agree more.

08:17.117 --> 08:18.785
But I think
that by formalizing

08:18.819 --> 08:20.621
the proceedings
with a deposition,

08:20.654 --> 08:22.255
it might cause them
to take a step back

08:22.288 --> 08:23.223
and say, "Whoa."

08:23.790 --> 08:25.391
There's no compliant filed.

08:25.425 --> 08:26.359
I know. And maybe

08:26.392 --> 08:28.494
there won't be if we do this.

08:28.529 --> 08:30.864
The goal is to make this
go away quickly, right?

08:31.464 --> 08:34.601
And you simply can't wait
to take your first deposition.

08:36.068 --> 08:38.038
Does it show?

08:38.071 --> 08:39.205
It's just that...

08:39.239 --> 08:41.307
for it to be against you--
talk about irony.

08:41.341 --> 08:43.208
You are such
a role model for me.

08:43.876 --> 08:44.645
I am?

08:44.678 --> 08:46.947
Yes.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.482
Not on stuff
like anger management,

08:49.516 --> 08:51.852
but professionally.

08:55.556 --> 08:58.058
After you'd been molested
by Father Brindle...

08:58.091 --> 08:58.825
Raped.

09:00.366 --> 09:01.434
...did you tell anybody?

09:02.135 --> 09:03.436
Not for 20 years.

09:04.104 --> 09:05.806
And as you read the pleadings

09:05.839 --> 09:07.608
in the class action complaint,

09:07.641 --> 09:10.476
you saw that
many other boys after you

09:10.511 --> 09:12.746
had also been molested,
is that correct, sir?

09:12.779 --> 09:13.847
Yes.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.982
Would those boys
have a cause of action

09:16.016 --> 09:17.751
against you for not telling?

09:17.784 --> 09:19.152
I didn't know
those other boys.

09:19.185 --> 09:20.453
As I testified, I thought

09:20.486 --> 09:21.855
that I was
the only victim, so...

09:21.888 --> 09:24.290
Did you tell Walter
you'd been molested?

09:26.660 --> 09:29.429
I told him that I no longer
trusted this priest

09:29.462 --> 09:30.897
and that he should be careful
around him.

09:30.931 --> 09:33.934
But you didn't tell Walter
you'd been molested.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.602
No.

09:35.636 --> 09:38.605
So he's expected to tell you
stuff you don't tell him.

09:38.639 --> 09:40.707
GRAYSON:
He didn't just not tell,

09:40.741 --> 09:42.408
he vouched for this priest.

09:42.442 --> 09:43.476
I didn't do that with him.

09:43.510 --> 09:45.445
ATTORNEY:
You've testified that...

09:45.478 --> 09:47.080
one of the reasons
you didn't come forward

09:47.113 --> 09:48.949
was because...

09:48.982 --> 09:50.483
you thought
there was the possibility

09:50.517 --> 09:52.252
that you were the only one
being victimized,

09:52.285 --> 09:53.554
did you not say that, sir?

09:53.587 --> 09:54.655
Yes.

09:54.688 --> 09:56.356
Did you allow
for the possibility

09:56.389 --> 09:58.424
that Mr. Beck also thought

09:58.458 --> 10:00.333
that he was the only victim?

10:05.471 --> 10:07.373
Even if he thought that,

10:07.407 --> 10:09.009
you don't just sit by quietly

10:09.042 --> 10:10.143
and let your best friend

10:10.176 --> 10:13.747
fall into a sex pervert's
clutches.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.849
He could have
and should have said something,

10:15.882 --> 10:17.784
instead he endorsed the guy.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.825
(overlapping chatter)

10:24.858 --> 10:26.627
FRUTT: I thought
he held up okay.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.861
YOUNG: I don't know.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.830
This comes down
to a definition of friendship.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.932
Slippery slope becomes a cliff.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.668
(sighs) Are you ready
for the defendant?

10:36.002 --> 10:37.070
Don't worry.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.204
I'll get him.

10:44.578 --> 10:45.579
FRUTT: You know, Eugene,

10:45.612 --> 10:47.981
this thing with the priests
and the sex abuse,

10:48.882 --> 10:51.151
it's made a lot of people angry.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.387
It's clearly made you angry.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.423
And?

10:57.924 --> 11:00.166
Well, I'm just curious

11:00.200 --> 11:01.835
as to why you seem
to be directing

11:01.868 --> 11:03.336
that anger at Bobby.

11:04.805 --> 11:06.840
He came at me
this morning, Ellenor.

11:06.873 --> 11:09.209
No. He attacked
the merits of our case.

11:09.242 --> 11:11.311
You responded
by attacking him.

11:12.345 --> 11:13.980
I didn't mean for it
to come off that way.

11:17.150 --> 11:19.586
Is something else
going on here?

11:19.620 --> 11:21.688
I'm upset over the case.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.256
If I acted out against him,

11:23.289 --> 11:26.527
uh, it wasn't my intent.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.294
And, again, he brought
it to me first.

11:30.964 --> 11:32.999
It's just
about the case with me.

11:35.536 --> 11:37.003
Okay.

11:37.037 --> 11:39.973
(overlapping chatter)

11:44.745 --> 11:46.780
BALL: Two, three,
sometimes four times.

11:46.813 --> 11:47.614
A month?

11:47.648 --> 11:48.849
A week.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.016
Can I interject?

11:50.050 --> 11:51.652
No. This isn't
a discussion.

11:51.685 --> 11:52.919
Well, I'd like you
to ask him how he knows.

11:52.953 --> 11:54.688
Zeus in heaven,
has he got his ear to the wall?

11:54.721 --> 11:56.122
I don't need my ear
to the wall, Louise.

11:56.156 --> 11:57.390
All right.
Let's not do this.

11:57.423 --> 11:58.358
She's a slut.

11:58.391 --> 12:00.266
STRINGER: Okay. Okay.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.835
Time out.

12:01.868 --> 12:03.504
I'm going to ask
the questions.

12:03.537 --> 12:05.071
Mr. Ball, you'll answer.

12:05.105 --> 12:07.007
Louise, you'll remain quiet.

12:08.842 --> 12:10.210
Excellent.

12:10.243 --> 12:12.312
So she would have
multiple sexual visits

12:12.345 --> 12:12.979
during the week?

12:13.013 --> 12:14.815
Sometimes, yes.

12:14.848 --> 12:16.216
And these visits interfered

12:16.249 --> 12:18.051
with the quiet enjoyment
of your property?

12:18.084 --> 12:19.285
Yes.

12:19.319 --> 12:21.922
STRINGER:
Because you could hear the...

12:21.955 --> 12:23.356
activity through the walls?

12:23.389 --> 12:24.558
Yes.

12:24.591 --> 12:25.225
STRINGER: Excellent.

12:25.258 --> 12:27.060
To the best of your ability,

12:27.093 --> 12:29.362
I'd like you to describe
these sounds.

12:29.395 --> 12:31.965
Oh, I don't have
to describe it.

12:31.998 --> 12:33.600
I taped it.

12:33.634 --> 12:35.636
I beg your pardon?

12:37.103 --> 12:39.072
Right here on tape.

12:39.105 --> 12:40.173
Shall I play?

12:40.206 --> 12:43.710
Well, sure.

12:43.744 --> 12:46.680
FARCHER (over recording):
(moaning)

12:52.653 --> 12:55.589
That's what you sound like?
Zeus in heaven.

12:55.622 --> 12:58.091
FARCHER (over recording):
(moaning)

12:58.124 --> 13:00.100
Okay, Albert,
we've heard it.

13:04.170 --> 13:06.907
As you can see...

13:06.940 --> 13:08.675
it's quite disruptive.

13:10.977 --> 13:14.147
I didn't seek out Arvin
and say to him,

13:14.180 --> 13:16.249
"You should go see this priest."

13:16.282 --> 13:18.852
Arvin came to me.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.754
He asked me if Father Brindle
was helping me.

13:20.787 --> 13:22.455
And you told him yes.

13:22.488 --> 13:26.492
I really thought
he could help Arvin.

13:26.527 --> 13:27.460
Also...

13:27.493 --> 13:29.329
ATTORNEY: Also what?

13:29.362 --> 13:31.732
Well, what the subsequent years

13:31.765 --> 13:34.868
of therapy have taught me,

13:34.901 --> 13:36.503
I was desperate to believe

13:36.537 --> 13:38.572
that Father Brindle
was a good man.

13:38.605 --> 13:40.507
And I was, perhaps, desperate

13:40.541 --> 13:42.075
to have my best friend,

13:42.108 --> 13:44.611
the person who I trusted most,
affirm this.

13:44.645 --> 13:46.847
It makes it sound
like you were using

13:46.880 --> 13:47.848
your friend a little.

13:47.881 --> 13:51.652
Unconsciously, I suppose I was.

13:51.685 --> 13:55.121
But I did believe
that he could help Arvin.

13:55.155 --> 13:56.890
And I didn't think
that Father Brindle

13:56.923 --> 13:58.692
would molest him.

13:58.725 --> 14:01.001
I really thought
that I was the lone target.

14:01.034 --> 14:03.403
And like Arvin,

14:03.436 --> 14:05.338
I assumed it was all my fault.

14:08.074 --> 14:09.876
Arvin, I am deeply,
deeply sorry.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.311
Objection.
Objection.

14:11.344 --> 14:13.847
Mr. Beck,
I'll ask you as well

14:13.880 --> 14:16.550
not to address
the opposing party.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.552
That's all I have.

14:20.687 --> 14:22.523
Eugene...

14:22.556 --> 14:23.757
be careful.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.491
The jury seems with him.

14:26.693 --> 14:27.894
YOUNG: First, Mr. Beck,

14:27.928 --> 14:30.130
if I may ask...

14:30.163 --> 14:32.666
how did Father Brindle
go about seducing you?

14:32.699 --> 14:36.803
It was almost exactly
as Arvin described.

14:36.837 --> 14:40.807
So as I understand it,
just like with Mr. Grayson,

14:40.841 --> 14:44.511
he basically used
a pretext of emotional counsel

14:44.545 --> 14:47.648
to eventually wind up
next to you naked

14:47.681 --> 14:48.515
on the couch.

14:48.549 --> 14:49.983
Correct.

14:50.016 --> 14:51.417
YOUNG: Yet when your best friend

14:51.451 --> 14:53.019
asked for your advice,

14:53.053 --> 14:55.421
you recommended
this priest for counseling.

14:55.455 --> 14:58.324
As I said, I didn't think
he'd be targeted.

14:58.358 --> 15:00.400
YOUNG: But you knew the man
targeted his patients.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.569
You're simplifying it,
Mr. Young.

15:02.603 --> 15:04.938
Had you told anybody
about your abuse?

15:05.672 --> 15:06.507
No.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.174
That must have been hard,

15:08.208 --> 15:09.943
not being able to talk about it,

15:09.976 --> 15:11.411
being the only one.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.048
You have no idea.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.150
YOUNG: I bet it would have
been easier,

15:17.183 --> 15:19.352
had there been
at least one other victim,

15:19.385 --> 15:20.521
somebody to talk to.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.690
I didn't send my best friend

15:23.724 --> 15:25.258
to a rapist
so I'd have company.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.460
You testified you were
desperate for affirmation.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.429
I didn't do that.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.731
Do you ever blame yourself, sir,

15:30.764 --> 15:32.298
for what happened
to Arvin Grayson?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.366
Of course, I do.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.935
A day doesn't go by--

15:41.341 --> 15:42.909
of course, I do.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.615
Thank you, Mr. Beck.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.392
How'd it go?

15:59.425 --> 16:01.034
Not bad.
They upped the offer to 110,

16:01.067 --> 16:02.503
so we must be
doing something right.

16:02.536 --> 16:04.137
Did you take it?

16:04.170 --> 16:05.171
The client turned it down.

16:05.205 --> 16:06.973
What?
Bobby...

16:07.007 --> 16:08.809
You should have jammed it
down the client's throat.

16:08.842 --> 16:09.776
The client was adamant.

16:09.810 --> 16:11.077
DONNELL: I don't care.

16:11.111 --> 16:12.445
You guys are partners.

16:12.478 --> 16:14.147
You see the books.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.716
We have to start exercising

16:15.749 --> 16:17.951
some discretion
on the cases we take.

16:17.984 --> 16:19.352
And we have to steer clients

16:19.385 --> 16:21.321
towards settlement
when it's indicated.

16:21.354 --> 16:22.956
Do I really need
to tell you that?

16:28.294 --> 16:29.630
(door closes)

16:44.210 --> 16:45.879
Ellenor asked me last night

16:45.912 --> 16:47.714
why I seemed
to be attacking you.

16:47.748 --> 16:49.716
I didn't really think I was,

16:49.750 --> 16:52.819
but the more I thought
about it,

16:52.853 --> 16:55.488
this case,

16:55.522 --> 16:57.658
it has made me angry
at you, Bobby.

16:58.559 --> 16:59.392
Why?

17:00.767 --> 17:03.003
You're not gonna like the answer
any better than I do.

17:03.870 --> 17:04.871
Why?

17:06.839 --> 17:07.840
You're Catholic.

17:09.609 --> 17:10.310
There.

17:10.343 --> 17:11.912
I said it.

17:11.944 --> 17:13.046
Last thing
I ever wanna believe

17:13.079 --> 17:15.315
is that I could
be guilty of bigotry, but...

17:15.348 --> 17:18.852
(sighs) it's the Catholics

17:18.885 --> 17:20.686
keeping the church
in business.

17:20.721 --> 17:22.288
People like you
who make donations,

17:22.321 --> 17:23.690
who go to the cathedrals,

17:23.723 --> 17:26.291
and put the envelope
in the offering plate.

17:26.326 --> 17:28.228
Those priests were protected.

17:28.261 --> 17:30.463
They were given safe harbor,

17:30.496 --> 17:32.298
allowed to go on raping kids

17:32.332 --> 17:34.535
because their crimes
were kept secret

17:34.568 --> 17:37.604
as policy--as policy...

17:37.638 --> 17:38.672
in the Catholic Church.

17:40.206 --> 17:41.708
I know that
most priests are good,

17:41.742 --> 17:43.343
don't get me wrong, but...

17:43.376 --> 17:44.611
what we're talking about here

17:44.645 --> 17:46.513
has been going on
for 30, 40 years.

17:46.547 --> 17:47.781
It's been systemic.

17:47.814 --> 17:50.016
And it's not enough
for the Catholic people to say,

17:50.050 --> 17:52.553
"Oh, isn't that awful?
And here's my check."

17:52.586 --> 17:55.221
And what do you propose
we do, Eugene?

17:55.255 --> 17:56.256
Shut the church down.

17:57.558 --> 17:59.560
Start a different institution
of Catholic faith.

17:59.593 --> 18:01.735
Hell, I might join myself.

18:01.768 --> 18:02.869
I propose you stop

18:02.903 --> 18:05.371
giving the current institution
the money.

18:05.405 --> 18:08.008
I propose you be more angry.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.611
Dozens of kids have been abused
in this state alone.

18:10.644 --> 18:12.813
And the church knew
it was going on,

18:12.846 --> 18:15.716
did nothing about it,
and let it continue.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.522
I propose you
be as angry...

18:21.555 --> 18:23.657
as I am,

18:23.690 --> 18:25.859
and that you good
Catholic people

18:25.892 --> 18:28.795
stop giving the church
the money.

18:32.899 --> 18:33.600
Bobby?

18:33.634 --> 18:35.101
What's wrong?

18:35.135 --> 18:37.203
Um, there's been some shooting.

18:37.237 --> 18:38.471
One of my clients.
I couldn't really follow,

18:38.505 --> 18:40.440
but I can't--I can't go there.

18:40.473 --> 18:41.842
Can you please go for me?

18:45.946 --> 18:48.882
(overlapping chatter)

18:52.452 --> 18:53.353
Oh.
(sighs)

18:53.386 --> 18:55.822
Don't tell me--your client?

18:55.856 --> 18:56.757
We think it might be Lindsay's.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.125
We don't know which.

18:59.159 --> 19:02.503
Well, (sighs)
dead one's over here.

19:02.536 --> 19:03.837
Shooter's in the bedroom.

19:10.944 --> 19:13.880
STRINGER: That's, um,
Lindsay's client.

19:15.549 --> 19:16.650
So Louise...

19:16.683 --> 19:17.984
In her bedroom.

19:18.018 --> 19:20.320
(sighs)

19:20.353 --> 19:22.956
I better go.

19:22.989 --> 19:24.525
(hurls)

19:27.460 --> 19:29.996
I'll, uh--

19:30.030 --> 19:31.131
I'll go in.

19:35.001 --> 19:36.036
Talk time's over, Mike.

19:36.069 --> 19:36.803
She's represented.

19:36.837 --> 19:38.138
By you?

19:39.205 --> 19:40.541
Give us some privacy,
will you?

19:45.679 --> 19:49.015
(door closes)

19:49.049 --> 19:50.584
My name is Bobby Donnell.

19:50.617 --> 19:51.685
I work with Jamie.

19:53.654 --> 19:55.255
First of all,

19:55.288 --> 19:57.824
what did you just
tell Detective McGuire?

20:00.026 --> 20:01.001
The truth.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.039
He came in with a knife.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.209
He was going to kill me.

20:10.010 --> 20:12.579
He said--

20:13.780 --> 20:16.416
he said he was going
to stab me in the heart

20:17.918 --> 20:19.485
so I would know the feeling.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.789
He just kept saying it,

20:22.823 --> 20:25.859
"I'm gonna stab you
in the heart."

20:27.327 --> 20:30.597
He came at me...

20:30.631 --> 20:32.065
and I shot him.

20:44.177 --> 20:44.878
DOLE: Did they arrest her?

20:44.911 --> 20:45.879
(sighs) Not yet.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.848
Could be justified
self-defense.

20:47.881 --> 20:49.850
She did call 911
when he first entered.

20:49.883 --> 20:51.451
Did he break in?
STRINGER: No.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.186
He let himself in
with his own key.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.289
He also has two assault priors

20:56.322 --> 20:57.691
and a history
of mental problems.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.726
Did he ever indicate
to you that...

20:59.760 --> 21:01.367
No. He never
gave any indication

21:01.401 --> 21:02.636
that he was going
to do anything.

21:04.237 --> 21:05.606
He was armed
with a kitchen knife.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.673
From whose kitchen?

21:06.707 --> 21:08.074
His.
DONNELL: Okay.

21:08.108 --> 21:09.409
We'll talk to her again.

21:09.442 --> 21:10.376
If everything checks out,

21:10.410 --> 21:11.344
we let her give
a full statement.

21:11.377 --> 21:12.779
In the meantime,
let's prepare

21:12.813 --> 21:14.280
as if they're going to charge.

21:17.584 --> 21:20.286
If Walter Beck
had simply told his friend

21:20.320 --> 21:23.289
that Father Brindle
was a rapist,

21:23.323 --> 21:26.392
Arvin Grayson
wouldn't have been raped.

21:27.260 --> 21:28.895
But Walter Beck,
who was in the habit

21:28.929 --> 21:31.932
of telling his
best friend everything,

21:31.965 --> 21:35.068
decided not
to tell him this.

21:35.101 --> 21:39.372
Instead he just let him
fall unknowingly

21:39.405 --> 21:41.675
into the hands
of a depraved...

21:41.708 --> 21:42.809
sex offender.

21:43.710 --> 21:45.311
About 15 years ago,

21:45.345 --> 21:47.548
a bunch of bystanders at a bar

21:47.581 --> 21:48.982
did nothing...

21:49.015 --> 21:50.383
while a woman was repeatedly

21:50.416 --> 21:52.919
raped on a pool table.

21:52.953 --> 21:54.487
A few years after that,

21:54.521 --> 21:58.324
a little girl was murdered
in a Las Vegas casino restroom

21:58.358 --> 22:01.034
while the killer's
friend did nothing.

22:02.368 --> 22:04.971
The public became outraged,

22:05.005 --> 22:07.473
and things started to change.

22:07.508 --> 22:09.175
Laws started getting passed

22:09.209 --> 22:12.312
criminalizing bystander apathy.

22:13.213 --> 22:16.016
Doctors today have
to report injuries

22:16.049 --> 22:18.484
that they think
are the results of crimes.

22:18.519 --> 22:21.487
Witnesses to child abuse
have to report it.

22:21.522 --> 22:23.389
We have laws now pending

22:23.423 --> 22:25.826
saying people have
to report foreigners

22:25.859 --> 22:27.193
taking flying lessons.

22:27.227 --> 22:29.630
We have got whistle-blowing laws

22:29.663 --> 22:31.331
to prevent stock fraud,

22:31.364 --> 22:32.566
corporate corruption,

22:32.599 --> 22:34.334
because the law

22:34.367 --> 22:36.737
is finally starting
to catch up

22:36.770 --> 22:39.205
to our sense of morality,

22:39.239 --> 22:40.941
requiring people

22:40.974 --> 22:44.444
to get the hell involved.

22:45.145 --> 22:47.581
It's also starting to catch up

22:47.614 --> 22:50.517
to our sense of reality,

22:50.551 --> 22:54.688
that unless we all become
our brothers' keepers,

22:54.721 --> 22:55.589
we're doomed.

22:56.657 --> 22:59.492
Here, we're not asking
for Walter Beck

22:59.526 --> 23:01.367
to have done all that much.

23:01.401 --> 23:03.770
We're not even asking him
to help a stranger,

23:03.804 --> 23:06.172
only his best friend.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.076
If he could have said so much
to Arvin Grayson

23:10.110 --> 23:12.112
as, "Hey...

23:12.145 --> 23:14.548
be careful."

23:14.581 --> 23:17.818
Instead, he continued
to endorse

23:17.851 --> 23:19.419
this abusive priest

23:19.452 --> 23:22.388
knowing he was a rapist.

23:23.690 --> 23:27.060
He not only failed
to prevent a crime,

23:27.093 --> 23:29.329
his silence, in fact,

23:29.362 --> 23:30.731
facilitated one,

23:30.764 --> 23:32.065
a horrible one.

23:34.034 --> 23:36.002
To say that Walter Beck
should bear

23:36.036 --> 23:38.739
no responsibility in this,

23:38.772 --> 23:40.674
that kind of thinking,

23:40.707 --> 23:43.777
it takes us back 15 years,

23:43.810 --> 23:47.413
when it was okay
to sit back and laugh

23:47.447 --> 23:50.784
while a woman got gang-raped
on a pool table.

23:55.221 --> 23:58.424
ATTORNEY: I agree
with Ms. Frutt on this.

23:58.458 --> 24:00.366
The world is changing.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.837
We're seeing a rush
of Chicken Little legislation,

24:03.870 --> 24:06.172
laws requiring everyone
to run around

24:06.206 --> 24:07.908
telling on everybody else.

24:07.941 --> 24:11.645
We're quickly becoming
the telltale nation.

24:11.678 --> 24:13.413
But even should you
wanna go

24:13.446 --> 24:16.416
where the law
has not yet gone,

24:16.449 --> 24:18.451
imposing a duty on one friend

24:18.484 --> 24:21.588
to help prevent
the molestation of another,

24:21.622 --> 24:23.624
the molestation, at a minimum,

24:23.657 --> 24:26.159
would have to be foreseeable.

24:26.192 --> 24:27.594
Here, it wasn't.

24:28.562 --> 24:30.496
As Mr. Beck testified,

24:30.531 --> 24:31.932
he did not think

24:31.965 --> 24:34.100
Mr. Grayson would be victimized.

24:34.134 --> 24:36.770
Should he have known?

24:36.803 --> 24:38.905
Should he have seen
more clearly?

24:39.973 --> 24:41.575
Are we going to start imposing

24:41.608 --> 24:44.244
that duty as well?

24:44.277 --> 24:46.613
Victims of sexual abuse

24:46.647 --> 24:49.650
should be required
to see and act clearly?

24:50.216 --> 24:51.217
Please.

24:52.619 --> 24:55.021
Privacy is rapidly
being eroded

24:55.055 --> 24:57.457
in this country.

24:57.490 --> 25:01.101
Public fear is certainly
winning out.

25:01.134 --> 25:02.569
But today...

25:02.603 --> 25:04.738
you're being asked
to impose a duty

25:04.771 --> 25:07.541
on sexual-abuse victims
to come forward

25:07.574 --> 25:11.044
and tell the world
what has happened to them,

25:11.077 --> 25:13.547
or at least tell
their best friends.

25:16.216 --> 25:17.551
(scoffs)

25:17.584 --> 25:19.485
God help us.

25:28.428 --> 25:29.996
So they're not gonna file?

25:30.030 --> 25:31.231
They're still investigating,

25:31.264 --> 25:33.266
but it doesn't look like it.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.869
How's Jamie?

25:35.902 --> 25:36.937
She's okay.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.304
She plunged
into preparing

25:38.338 --> 25:39.973
a defense just in case.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.375
So she's occupying herself.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.710
(sighs)

25:43.744 --> 25:44.410
How are you?

25:44.911 --> 25:46.713
I'm okay.

25:47.447 --> 25:49.583
It's a little too much déjà vu
too early, I guess.

25:52.786 --> 25:53.587
How are you?

25:54.855 --> 25:56.122
I'm fine.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.924
You talk to Eugene again?

26:00.466 --> 26:01.467
No.

26:04.070 --> 26:06.306
Listen, when I told you
what he said,

26:08.274 --> 26:09.342
you didn't respond.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.545
Is that because
you agree with him?

26:14.047 --> 26:16.116
I don't blame

26:16.149 --> 26:18.652
the Catholic people
for abusive priests.

26:18.685 --> 26:20.053
I certainly
don't blame you.

26:20.086 --> 26:23.256
But it seems like you're
withholding on the issue.

26:23.289 --> 26:25.091
Are you?

26:25.125 --> 26:25.859
DOLE: No.

26:25.892 --> 26:27.060
Are you?

26:27.093 --> 26:29.896
I don't really want to talk
about this now.

26:29.930 --> 26:32.833
Lindsay, I'd like
to talk about it now.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.636
Okay.

26:38.004 --> 26:39.640
Every so often, you bring up

26:39.673 --> 26:42.342
how we haven't christened
Bobby Jr. yet,

26:42.375 --> 26:43.844
and we really need
to do that,

26:43.877 --> 26:47.247
and I always find
a way to deflect it.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.348
Well...

26:51.351 --> 26:52.753
I'm just gonna say this.

26:54.721 --> 26:56.923
There's no way I'm gonna
let him be raised Catholic.

26:58.759 --> 27:01.267
It is not a faith
or an ideology issue,

27:01.301 --> 27:03.970
but even with the remotest
of possibilities

27:04.004 --> 27:05.205
that he could fall
into the hands

27:05.238 --> 27:06.339
of the wrong priest--

27:06.372 --> 27:08.074
That's totally prejudiced.

27:08.108 --> 27:10.276
I don't deny it.

27:10.310 --> 27:12.412
But I would rather be
a bigot than risk--

27:12.445 --> 27:14.414
Let's talk about
other religions.

27:14.447 --> 27:16.182
You don't think a minister
or a rabbi has ever--

27:16.216 --> 27:19.920
Probably, but not
as many as priests.

27:19.953 --> 27:21.287
Until you drop
the celibacy thing,

27:21.321 --> 27:22.255
Catholic clergy--

27:22.288 --> 27:24.290
I'm not gonna hear this.

27:24.324 --> 27:25.458
Fine.

27:25.491 --> 27:27.127
I mean, I can't believe
you'd be guilty

27:27.160 --> 27:28.494
of such blatant bigotry!

27:29.429 --> 27:30.363
I'm a mother,

27:30.396 --> 27:32.298
and my son will never be walking

27:32.332 --> 27:34.300
into any confessional alone.

27:34.334 --> 27:35.435
I know that's a prejudice,

27:35.468 --> 27:37.938
but the church has to accept
some responsibility

27:37.971 --> 27:38.872
for my bigotry as well.

27:38.905 --> 27:39.940
Oh, really?
Yes.

27:39.973 --> 27:41.975
When somebody walks
through your door

27:42.008 --> 27:43.977
and says, "One
of your priests raped me,"

27:44.010 --> 27:45.512
you don't just reach
for the phone

27:45.546 --> 27:47.080
and dial up your publicist.

27:57.691 --> 27:58.659
When did
the jury go out?

27:58.692 --> 27:59.826
About an hour ago.

27:59.860 --> 28:01.668
I don't think we're gonna
hear anything today.

28:03.169 --> 28:04.871
I'm thinking we should see
if that offer still stands.

28:04.905 --> 28:06.673
You closed well, Ellenor.

28:07.941 --> 28:09.142
Zeus in heaven.

28:09.175 --> 28:10.677
Oh, my God.

28:10.711 --> 28:13.046
I've been pulling up every case,

28:13.079 --> 28:14.047
every clipping I can

28:14.080 --> 28:15.248
with similar fact patterns

28:15.281 --> 28:18.251
to see if anybody anywhere
used any new defenses on--

28:21.221 --> 28:23.757
seven years ago
in Denver, same thing.

28:23.790 --> 28:25.592
A woman shot her
ex-boyfriend

28:25.626 --> 28:27.260
trying to kill her
with a knife.

28:27.293 --> 28:28.461
Exact same thing.

28:29.362 --> 28:30.564
So what's the problem?

28:33.133 --> 28:34.668
STRINGER: Exact same woman.

28:35.335 --> 28:36.102
What?!

28:36.136 --> 28:37.804
STRINGER:
She had a different name,

28:37.838 --> 28:39.906
different Social Security
Number, but that's her!

28:39.940 --> 28:41.007
Well, was she charged?

28:41.041 --> 28:42.375
STRINGER: No.
The police ruled it

28:42.408 --> 28:43.610
justifiable self-defense.

28:43.644 --> 28:45.812
She was so traumatized,
according to this article,

28:45.846 --> 28:46.913
she left to start
a new life.

28:46.947 --> 28:48.114
So she's done
this before.

28:48.148 --> 28:49.916
And not just once.

28:49.950 --> 28:50.884
Three years ago
in Cleveland,

28:50.917 --> 28:52.218
again a boyfriend,

28:52.252 --> 28:54.087
again justified
self-defense.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.989
There's no picture here
but it quote,

28:56.022 --> 28:58.592
"He just came at me
from nowhere, Zeus in heaven."

28:59.826 --> 29:02.769
(music playing)

29:13.113 --> 29:14.414
WASHINGTON:
What I don't understand

29:14.447 --> 29:16.583
is if you could pull this up
in six hours,

29:16.617 --> 29:17.751
why can't the police?

29:17.784 --> 29:19.653
DONNELL: The police
aren't investigating.

29:19.686 --> 29:21.354
Both shootings
were ruled justifiable.

29:21.387 --> 29:22.422
They're not looking.

29:22.455 --> 29:24.190
Well, how many boyfriends
does she have to kill

29:24.224 --> 29:25.325
before they get
suspicious?

29:25.358 --> 29:26.727
The same woman didn't do it,

29:26.760 --> 29:27.861
as far as they know.

29:27.894 --> 29:29.630
She's had three
different identities,

29:29.663 --> 29:31.865
which, by the way,
is simple to do.

29:31.898 --> 29:32.766
HATCHER:
So what do you do now

29:32.799 --> 29:35.135
besides not date her?

29:35.736 --> 29:38.171
(door opens)

29:38.204 --> 29:39.873
Jamie.

29:39.906 --> 29:42.142
(door closes)

29:42.175 --> 29:43.510
Can I talk to you?

29:43.544 --> 29:44.945
STRINGER: Sure.

29:44.978 --> 29:46.046
Go in the conference room.

29:46.079 --> 29:47.347
I'll be right in.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.184
(door closes)

29:51.217 --> 29:51.985
What do I do?

29:52.018 --> 29:53.119
We stick to this case.

29:53.153 --> 29:54.254
Why?

29:54.287 --> 29:55.321
DONNELL:
Because what we don't know

29:55.355 --> 29:56.422
could help us, Jamie,

29:56.456 --> 29:58.324
should she ever get charged
on this case.

29:58.358 --> 29:59.726
Oh, come on. We know.

29:59.760 --> 30:00.767
We saw the newspaper.

30:00.801 --> 30:04.470
We saw a woman
who looked like her, period.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.280
So what's happening?

30:14.314 --> 30:16.650
The police are still
investigating.

30:16.683 --> 30:18.519
We're hoping
they rule it justifiable.

30:19.219 --> 30:19.953
Good.

30:21.555 --> 30:23.524
Listen, this whole thing

30:23.557 --> 30:24.925
is obviously upsetting.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.429
I can't continue
to live in that apartment.

30:29.462 --> 30:32.365
In fact, I'm thinking
maybe it's best

30:32.398 --> 30:34.300
if I leave Boston
altogether.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.636
STRINGER: Oh?

30:35.669 --> 30:36.870
I think maybe I should just try

30:36.903 --> 30:39.005
to start a new life somewhere,

30:39.039 --> 30:40.607
try to escape all this.

30:40.641 --> 30:41.508
DONNELL: Certainly
you don't wanna leave

30:41.542 --> 30:42.709
the jurisdiction now.

30:42.743 --> 30:44.811
The police would
consider that suspicious.

30:44.845 --> 30:46.713
After they decide not
to charge you,

30:46.747 --> 30:48.181
that would be the time
to think about leaving.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.751
I see.

30:50.784 --> 30:52.719
Yes, of course.

30:52.753 --> 30:53.987
Zeus in heaven,

30:54.020 --> 30:56.489
I can't even begin to think
where I would even go.

30:56.523 --> 30:57.691
Denver's nice.

30:59.860 --> 31:00.867
So is Cleveland.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.538
Why did you say that?

31:04.571 --> 31:07.107
Oh, I visited Denver once.

31:07.140 --> 31:08.208
It was beautiful.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.443
And who doesn't love Cleveland?

31:11.845 --> 31:12.913
Listen, I've been talking

31:12.946 --> 31:14.881
to some potential
character witnesses,

31:14.915 --> 31:17.117
and you've got plenty
of support, by the way.

31:17.150 --> 31:18.218
But I found out

31:18.251 --> 31:21.655
Albert actually
broke up with you,

31:21.688 --> 31:23.389
not the other way around.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.758
I never said it was
the other way around.

31:24.791 --> 31:26.827
Well, it's just
in characterizing him

31:26.860 --> 31:28.328
as the jealous ex-boyfriend.

31:29.295 --> 31:30.931
Uh, also,
one of your lovers said

31:30.964 --> 31:32.098
that he got the idea

31:32.132 --> 31:34.067
that you were trying
to make Albert jealous,

31:34.100 --> 31:36.236
you know, to punish him
a little.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.071
Would I be the first
girlfriend to do that?

31:38.104 --> 31:40.173
(chuckles)

31:40.206 --> 31:41.642
No,

31:41.675 --> 31:42.576
you wouldn't.

31:47.914 --> 31:49.850
I expressly told you
not to confront her!

31:49.883 --> 31:51.017
I didn't, I just--

31:51.051 --> 31:52.986
"How about Denver
or Cleveland?"

31:53.019 --> 31:54.087
What the hell was that?!

31:54.120 --> 31:56.089
That's hardly
confronting her.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.390
And the stuff
about the witnesses

31:57.423 --> 31:59.259
was relevant
to this case, Bobby.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.234
Don't play games with me.

32:02.769 --> 32:04.871
You were fishing in waters
I asked you not to.

32:04.905 --> 32:06.573
I threw out
one little cast.

32:06.607 --> 32:08.174
Don't do it again.

32:08.208 --> 32:09.510
Do I make myself clear?

32:12.178 --> 32:13.113
Yes.

32:13.146 --> 32:16.416
There is a pecking
order here, Jamie.

32:16.449 --> 32:17.483
Let's not forget that.

32:19.185 --> 32:20.521
I won't.

32:21.487 --> 32:22.523
DONNELL: She's been hanging
around Lucy too much.

32:22.556 --> 32:23.524
That's her problem.

32:23.557 --> 32:25.592
Picking up
all that sassiness.

32:25.626 --> 32:27.594
I think she's still
pushing to fit in.

32:27.628 --> 32:29.896
Fit in? She challenges us
at every turn.

32:29.930 --> 32:31.865
Do they teach that
at Harvard now?

32:31.898 --> 32:34.835
Well, the last
Harvard grad worked out.

32:34.868 --> 32:35.936
You married her.

32:35.969 --> 32:38.404
That's not gonna happen
this time.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.207
Listen, Jimmy, uh...

32:42.909 --> 32:46.479
I do have something
I want to talk to you about,

32:46.513 --> 32:47.814
Catholic to Catholic.

32:51.685 --> 32:54.154
How are you handling
this priest thing?

32:55.889 --> 32:57.157
I don't know.

32:57.190 --> 32:59.092
Well, clearly,
you've thought about it.

32:59.125 --> 33:01.668
Thought about it?

33:01.702 --> 33:03.970
Bobby, a lot of nights,

33:04.004 --> 33:04.838
I don't sleep.

33:07.708 --> 33:09.543
I'm not
an abstract thinker.

33:09.576 --> 33:12.579
You know,
when I think of God,

33:12.613 --> 33:15.448
I kind of give him
a human image,

33:15.481 --> 33:17.918
my priest.

33:17.951 --> 33:19.620
In a way,
he's always represented

33:19.653 --> 33:22.455
the face of God to me.

33:22.488 --> 33:25.759
So to think of priests

33:25.792 --> 33:28.562
doing what some of them did,

33:28.595 --> 33:29.696
it's...

33:32.432 --> 33:35.936
Have you ever thought about...

33:35.969 --> 33:38.404
leaving the church over it?

33:39.005 --> 33:40.607
No.

33:40.641 --> 33:44.578
That would be like
leaving God.

33:44.611 --> 33:47.347
Bobby, the church
is not just the priests.

33:47.380 --> 33:49.115
It's you and me.

33:49.149 --> 33:51.384
We are the church.

33:51.417 --> 33:53.219
To leave would be like

33:53.253 --> 33:55.656
walking away from ourselves,

33:55.689 --> 33:58.424
who we are, people of God.

33:58.458 --> 34:02.035
But as people of God,
how do we tolerate these...

34:02.068 --> 34:05.606
Look, the media
has so overblown this.

34:05.639 --> 34:07.373
They don't talk
about all the good

34:07.407 --> 34:08.975
the church does,

34:09.009 --> 34:10.275
and it's a lot.

34:11.545 --> 34:13.045
Maybe he's right.

34:13.647 --> 34:14.648
Who?

34:14.681 --> 34:16.516
Eugene.

34:18.819 --> 34:20.754
There isn't enough rage.

34:23.255 --> 34:26.192
(music playing)

34:35.135 --> 34:36.136
PENDER: All right, then.

34:36.168 --> 34:37.904
Mr. Foreman,
I'll ask you to rise

34:37.938 --> 34:39.105
and read your verdict
to the court.

34:42.509 --> 34:45.078
In the matter
of Grayson versus Beck,

34:45.110 --> 34:48.313
we the jury find in favor
of the plaintiff,

34:48.348 --> 34:50.951
and we order the defendant
to pay compensatory damages

34:50.984 --> 34:53.887
in the amount
of $1.4 million.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.857
(overlapping chatter)

34:58.925 --> 35:00.534
PENDER: This trial is completed.

35:00.567 --> 35:03.203
Members of the jury,
your service is finished.

35:03.236 --> 35:05.038
We thank you.

35:05.071 --> 35:06.873
And this matter is adjourned.

35:06.907 --> 35:07.841
(gavel bangs)

35:12.412 --> 35:14.247
Thank you.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.782
Thank you both.

35:15.816 --> 35:18.151
Be prepared for an appeal,

35:18.184 --> 35:20.420
and it's one we have to take
very seriously.

35:20.887 --> 35:21.655
I know.

35:21.688 --> 35:23.356
Congratulations.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.058
GRAYSON: Thank you.

35:25.091 --> 35:26.827
Thanks again.

35:29.162 --> 35:34.467
(music playing)

35:38.038 --> 35:39.172
Another?
STRINGER: I think so,

35:39.205 --> 35:40.774
Calgary, Alberta.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.609
She lived there for a year
after Denver.

35:42.643 --> 35:43.844
That's her. See?

35:43.877 --> 35:45.245
And she shot yet
another boyfriend?

35:45.278 --> 35:47.981
All four had criminal records
for assault, battery.

35:48.014 --> 35:49.650
I think
it's a prerequisite for her.

35:49.683 --> 35:51.417
Uh, it helps her justify
her shootings.

35:51.451 --> 35:53.119
And every time,
she's been cleared?

35:53.153 --> 35:54.755
And then falls off
the face of the earth.

35:55.689 --> 35:56.790
Four victims.

35:56.823 --> 35:58.024
And counting.

35:58.058 --> 36:00.060
That was Helen Gamble's office.

36:00.093 --> 36:01.802
It's been ruled
justifiable self-defense.

36:01.835 --> 36:03.436
We have to tell them.

36:03.469 --> 36:04.671
Tell who?

36:04.705 --> 36:05.438
The police.

36:05.471 --> 36:06.640
There are going to be more.

36:06.673 --> 36:07.373
She's serial!

36:07.407 --> 36:08.709
You want to lose
your bar ticket?

36:08.742 --> 36:10.644
So we say nothing?

36:10.677 --> 36:11.678
We don't tell anybody?

36:11.712 --> 36:12.646
(door opens)

36:14.681 --> 36:17.818
We won, $1.4 million.

36:17.851 --> 36:18.819
What?

36:18.852 --> 36:19.820
You won?

36:19.853 --> 36:21.054
The laws are changing, folks.

36:21.087 --> 36:22.723
We're as shocked as you are.

36:22.756 --> 36:23.724
Congratulations.

36:25.726 --> 36:26.827
Really.

36:27.293 --> 36:28.361
Thank you.

36:29.495 --> 36:31.665
HATCHER: Uh, Eugene,
this came for you.

36:31.698 --> 36:34.300
I did not accept service,
but he left it anyway.

36:35.468 --> 36:36.637
What is it?

36:36.670 --> 36:38.839
You know
a Marshall Hatsburg?

36:38.872 --> 36:40.240
Marshall,

36:40.273 --> 36:41.875
yes, he worked
at the church, too.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.779
You and he were friends?

36:45.812 --> 36:48.048
Friendly, played
basketball together,

36:48.081 --> 36:50.350
but I wouldn't say
we were close, why?

36:51.084 --> 36:52.185
He's suing you.

36:52.786 --> 36:53.920
What?

36:53.954 --> 36:56.256
For not telling him
about Father Brindle.

36:56.289 --> 36:58.525
Seems he was raped
after you.

36:58.559 --> 37:02.268
(music playing)

37:15.148 --> 37:15.882
Louise?

37:15.915 --> 37:17.651
(gasps)

37:17.684 --> 37:19.485
Zeus in heaven,

37:19.520 --> 37:20.621
you startled me.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.456
Clearing out?

37:23.489 --> 37:24.190
Yes.

37:24.224 --> 37:26.927
Lucy called,

37:26.960 --> 37:29.429
told me the shooting
was ruled justifiable.

37:29.462 --> 37:32.866
So I thought
I'd pack and go.

37:32.899 --> 37:33.800
The sooner,
the better.

37:34.635 --> 37:35.569
Where to?

37:36.803 --> 37:39.439
You know, I haven't
really decided yet.

37:39.472 --> 37:41.174
I'm gonna go
see some friends,

37:41.207 --> 37:42.776
move around,

37:42.809 --> 37:45.211
pick a place,
I guess.

37:45.245 --> 37:46.647
Any suggestions?

37:46.680 --> 37:48.949
Well...

37:48.982 --> 37:51.484
after Denver and Cleveland,

37:51.518 --> 37:52.953
only leaves Calgary.

37:54.888 --> 37:56.757
Never been there.

37:56.790 --> 37:58.158
Maybe I'll try it.

37:59.826 --> 38:00.834
Uh-huh.

38:03.203 --> 38:04.605
Why are you here, Jamie?

38:07.273 --> 38:10.877
Trying to get me
to say something?

38:10.911 --> 38:13.246
It's almost as if you think

38:13.279 --> 38:14.915
I'm a killer or something.

38:17.784 --> 38:20.721
Of course,
if you did think that,

38:20.754 --> 38:23.890
I doubt you'd come
here alone.

38:23.924 --> 38:25.058
That'd be dangerous.

38:28.862 --> 38:31.164
If you'll excuse me now,

38:31.197 --> 38:33.199
I need to finish packing.

38:46.513 --> 38:49.449
(bell tolling)

39:11.745 --> 39:12.846
Bobby?

39:15.081 --> 39:16.482
DONNELL: Hey, Father,

39:18.018 --> 39:19.753
thanks for agreeing
to meet me here.

39:19.786 --> 39:21.454
Oh, no problem.

39:27.694 --> 39:29.162
I'm leaving
the church, Father.

39:31.798 --> 39:34.801
Oh, uh,
what do you mean?

39:34.835 --> 39:36.236
Leaving the church?

39:36.269 --> 39:39.339
DONNELL: I have loved being
a part of this parish,

39:42.042 --> 39:45.912
and specifically,
being your parishioner,

39:45.946 --> 39:48.114
but the sex-abuse
scandal--

39:48.148 --> 39:49.950
Bobby, let's sit down
and talk.

39:49.983 --> 39:51.484
What can you say,

39:51.518 --> 39:53.086
molestation gets a bad rap?

39:53.119 --> 39:54.955
I can say

39:54.988 --> 39:57.624
that the offending clergy
makes up

39:57.658 --> 40:00.333
a microscopic portion
of the priesthood.

40:00.366 --> 40:02.102
I know that,

40:02.135 --> 40:05.872
but the church's
concealment--

40:05.906 --> 40:07.473
it's enabling
these priests

40:07.508 --> 40:09.710
to destroy
so many young lives.

40:09.743 --> 40:12.112
We've made mistakes.

40:12.145 --> 40:14.247
I believe that we're
acknowledging them.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.349
Our new policy
is zero tolerance.

40:16.382 --> 40:18.885
I know the litigation
tactics being employed

40:18.919 --> 40:20.554
against the victims.

40:20.587 --> 40:21.888
I also know that--

40:24.024 --> 40:25.892
look...

40:25.926 --> 40:29.062
this isn't
about vengeance.

40:32.966 --> 40:35.569
Bobby...

40:35.602 --> 40:37.403
when you have a crisis
of conscience--

40:37.437 --> 40:39.172
well, any personal crisis,

40:39.205 --> 40:40.607
for that matter,
where do you go?

40:40.641 --> 40:42.576
I come to you.

40:44.144 --> 40:47.313
But this isn't
about you or--

40:49.149 --> 40:52.252
I'm not leaving the faith.

40:53.319 --> 40:55.055
Just the church.

40:55.088 --> 40:57.824
My son,

40:57.858 --> 41:00.601
when you leave the church,

41:00.634 --> 41:02.102
you leave the faith.

41:04.137 --> 41:04.871
Can I give you the speech

41:04.905 --> 41:06.239
about all of the good work

41:06.272 --> 41:07.774
that we've done?

41:07.808 --> 41:09.075
Do you have any notion

41:09.109 --> 41:12.045
of the global
charitable work done

41:12.078 --> 41:13.079
by the Catholic Church?

41:13.113 --> 41:15.248
I do.

41:15.281 --> 41:17.050
But I don't look
to the church

41:17.083 --> 41:20.754
like it's the united way.

41:20.787 --> 41:22.255
For me

41:22.288 --> 41:26.226
it's about spiritual
and moral leadership.

41:30.330 --> 41:33.867
Until you expel
every offending priest,

41:35.368 --> 41:37.504
everyone involved

41:37.538 --> 41:39.540
with protecting them

41:39.573 --> 41:41.842
and concealing them,

41:41.875 --> 41:44.310
there's been
no true penance.

41:45.478 --> 41:48.782
When that day comes,
I hope to return.

41:48.815 --> 41:49.816
FATHER: Bobby,

41:51.785 --> 41:54.588
you can't just leave.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.539
Goodbye, Father.

42:05.572 --> 42:08.509
(music playing)

42:27.360 --> 42:28.695
BERLUTI: Next on The Practice.

42:28.729 --> 42:29.663
Why us?

42:29.696 --> 42:31.464
MAN: Because Helen Gamble
is a DA.

42:31.497 --> 42:33.366
Also you're
on the short list of lawyers

42:33.399 --> 42:34.901
willing to defend scum.

42:34.935 --> 42:35.902
What's the case?

42:35.936 --> 42:37.137
Statutory rape.

42:37.170 --> 42:38.004
I don't want it.

42:38.038 --> 42:39.205
I didn't ask.

42:39.239 --> 42:40.874
And you think to avoid a trial,

42:40.907 --> 42:43.076
I'm going to put a child rapist
back on the street.

42:43.109 --> 42:45.378
We think we could sell
minimum security.

42:45.411 --> 42:48.849
And Mr. Orbis is going
to a maximum security prison.

42:48.882 --> 42:50.350
BERLUTI:
There is a problem here.

42:50.383 --> 42:51.785
We can win this.

42:55.689 --> 42:58.625
(music playing)

43:20.220 --> 43:21.655
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:23.256 --> 43:25.926
