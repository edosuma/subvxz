WEBVTT

00:07.810 --> 00:10.072
- Previously on "Get Shorty"...
- Did you show them the books?

00:10.148 --> 00:12.050
- Yeah.
- There it is!

00:12.102 --> 00:13.684
Money laundering, you...

00:13.979 --> 00:15.320
What if we tell L.A.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.282
that we can clean $30 million
of their money?

00:17.382 --> 00:20.525
You risk nothing,
and you make money off them.

00:20.625 --> 00:21.886
I'm making another movie.

00:21.986 --> 00:24.328
It needs to be privately financed.

00:24.428 --> 00:26.130
How close are you with L.A.?

00:26.230 --> 00:27.811
You want me to make an introduction?

00:27.911 --> 00:30.494
We require an additional 5%.

00:30.594 --> 00:33.296
- This a joke?
- It is not.

00:33.396 --> 00:35.779
So, these investors, they're...
they're friends of Amara's?

00:35.879 --> 00:37.100
Associates.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.581
Like her but just...

00:38.681 --> 00:40.103
on a bigger level?

00:40.203 --> 00:42.345
I wanted to update you on "Wylderness".

00:42.445 --> 00:44.627
Yeah, I'm past that.

00:44.727 --> 00:47.549
- Shit. What were you burning?
- Old photos.

00:47.650 --> 00:48.831
It's pretty.

00:48.931 --> 00:50.953
It's a witch's mirror.

00:51.053 --> 00:52.594
Oh. Does that make you a witch?

00:52.709 --> 00:54.804
Looks like Deborah Schaffer's kids.

00:54.828 --> 00:56.185
Deborah Schaffer the actress?

00:56.209 --> 00:57.238
Yeah.

00:57.338 --> 00:58.600
This is the divorce papers?

00:58.700 --> 01:00.802
There's a part about custody
on page two.

01:00.902 --> 01:02.964
You gonna take her away from me.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.765
When we first saw Rick,
he was frightened.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.967
I told him
we would use all our resources

01:07.067 --> 01:08.529
to make sure he wouldn't get hurt.

01:08.629 --> 01:11.772
I'm going to make a deal,
so if I were you,

01:11.872 --> 01:14.114
I'd make sure he's still
breathing when the feds come.

01:36.443 --> 01:39.546
Hello?

01:43.610 --> 01:46.372
Hello?!

01:59.625 --> 02:03.388
Hmm.

02:23.246 --> 02:26.589
Hey, hey, hey, help me. Help me.

02:26.689 --> 02:28.031
Hey. Hey! Hey!

02:28.131 --> 02:30.839
I need help!

03:15.614 --> 03:19.438
Gonna help you, all right?

03:19.538 --> 03:21.840
They put the bag on my head, and then...

03:21.940 --> 03:24.522
then wrapped duct tape around my neck.

03:24.622 --> 03:27.405
Pills alone would have killed me,

03:27.505 --> 03:29.087
even without the bag.

03:29.187 --> 03:31.929
You said they made a hole in the bag?

03:32.029 --> 03:35.052
Yeah. I don't know how long they waited.

03:35.152 --> 03:38.015
Got light-headed, and... I passed out.

03:38.115 --> 03:39.456
You're okay now.

03:39.556 --> 03:41.218
How's the shoulder?

03:41.318 --> 03:43.059
It's starting to hurt again.

03:43.159 --> 03:44.501
- Another click?
- Mm, two.

03:44.601 --> 03:46.823
Give it a minute. The pain will subside.

03:46.923 --> 03:50.626
Yeah.

03:50.726 --> 03:52.628
Is that pudding?

03:52.728 --> 03:54.510
What flavor is that?

03:54.610 --> 03:56.872
Uh... ooh, butterscotch.

03:56.972 --> 03:59.154
- That's a good one.
- Oh, yeah.

03:59.254 --> 04:02.237
I think my blood sugar's low.

04:02.337 --> 04:04.639
- Could you do that for me?
- Oh.

04:04.739 --> 04:06.561
So, what's going to happen now?

04:06.661 --> 04:10.124
You're going to arrest everyone,
or just Miles and Louis?

04:10.224 --> 04:13.567
I mean, they must have told
Amara by now, right, hmm?

04:13.667 --> 04:14.688
The jig's up.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.570
It's all over.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.911
We were discussing that.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.657
I'm gonna miss Amara.

04:23.757 --> 04:25.378
Is that crazy?

04:25.478 --> 04:28.501
Just... we been through a lot.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.704
Even the creepy guys
that she works with, hmm.

04:31.804 --> 04:33.586
We can't arrest anyone yet.

04:33.686 --> 04:36.669
Good news is, opportunities have
arisen in the case.

04:36.769 --> 04:37.910
- Very exciting.
- Wait.

04:38.010 --> 04:39.391
I-I-I'm talking Miles and Louis.

04:39.491 --> 04:40.792
They know about the investigation.

04:40.892 --> 04:42.114
They know everything.

04:42.214 --> 04:43.715
They won't share that information.

04:43.815 --> 04:45.156
They know to keep it to themselves.

04:45.256 --> 04:46.678
Well...

04:46.778 --> 04:49.460
Did you make a deal with them?

04:51.983 --> 04:53.564
They tried to kill me.

04:53.664 --> 04:55.165
You made a fucking deal?

04:55.266 --> 04:57.608
We all agree you have been exemplary,

04:57.708 --> 04:59.890
and we won't make you
wear a wire any longer.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.291
You're off the hook.

05:01.391 --> 05:02.812
What am I supposed to do now?

05:02.913 --> 05:04.374
Supposed to hide out here?

05:04.474 --> 05:06.576
I can't go back to Amara's house.

05:06.676 --> 05:09.378
We prepared an alibi
for your last 12 hours,

05:09.479 --> 05:12.742
hospital charts explaining your injury,

05:12.842 --> 05:14.423
discharge papers.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.505
We'll go over all this.

05:16.605 --> 05:18.347
And we got your car repaired.

05:18.447 --> 05:20.449
You can go back to Amara's tonight.

05:22.130 --> 05:26.594
They... They put a bag over my head.

05:30.057 --> 05:32.960
You can opt for witness protection.

05:33.060 --> 05:34.602
Won't be a problem getting you approved,

05:34.702 --> 05:36.003
but I know you didn't want to do that.

05:37.664 --> 05:39.646
- And sweetheart, I agree.
- That's not a life.

05:39.746 --> 05:42.249
Your best option
is to pick up where you left off

05:42.349 --> 05:44.771
and put this investigation
out of your mind.

05:44.871 --> 05:46.873
How does that sound?

05:49.956 --> 05:51.737
I...

05:59.524 --> 06:01.666
This a booty call?

06:01.766 --> 06:02.988
Yeah, what if it is?

06:03.088 --> 06:05.430
You know you can just text me.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.952
Well, this is more romantic.

06:08.052 --> 06:09.634
I guess.

06:09.734 --> 06:11.275
I got some work stuff
I got to deal with.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.437
Then I'll come over.

06:13.537 --> 06:16.300
I'll put on my good underwear.

06:30.513 --> 06:32.515
Come on, man. What are you doing?

06:34.316 --> 06:36.899
You can't even carry those yourself.

06:36.999 --> 06:41.263
Lou, they had a folder on us
the size of an encyclopedia,

06:41.363 --> 06:42.704
way more than Rick told us,

06:42.804 --> 06:45.306
but I got immunity for the both of us

06:45.406 --> 06:46.868
and we don't have to testify.

06:46.968 --> 06:49.610
- What did you give them?
- Nothing.

06:51.292 --> 06:53.033
Just, you know...

06:53.134 --> 06:55.476
They put their own accountants
on the movie

06:55.576 --> 06:56.997
and tracked the money. That's it.

06:57.097 --> 06:59.840
I had to.

06:59.940 --> 07:02.082
The thought of Emma getting on a bus

07:02.182 --> 07:03.803
to come and see me when I'm locked up.

07:03.903 --> 07:05.805
Oh, that's your justification, your kid?

07:05.905 --> 07:07.487
'Cause, you know,
I got a kid on the way.

07:07.587 --> 07:08.888
All the more reason.

07:08.988 --> 07:11.811
You have no idea
how this is going to turn out!

07:11.911 --> 07:14.093
And meanwhile, I'm a fucking rat.

07:14.193 --> 07:15.854
No. No, no.

07:15.954 --> 07:18.297
No-Nobody was wearing a wire
or giving information.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.339
We're just making our movie and
then staying out of their way.

07:21.439 --> 07:23.301
You never even had to speak to them!

07:23.401 --> 07:24.702
You think that anyone
is going to believe

07:24.803 --> 07:25.824
that you made a deal with the feds

07:25.924 --> 07:27.925
and I didn't know about it?!

07:29.327 --> 07:32.510
I got to work with Amara tonight, so...

07:32.610 --> 07:34.612
if you'll excuse me.

07:35.612 --> 07:37.314
So come and work on the
movie with me, Lou.

07:37.414 --> 07:40.517
You can be associate
producer, and then when...

07:40.617 --> 07:44.240
when the filming is done, Amara is gone.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.964
Imagine that! You can
do whatever you want.

07:48.064 --> 07:49.325
You don't even know the movie's going.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.327
- The movie is going!
- Well, it better,

07:51.427 --> 07:54.570
because that is your only
leverage with the feds,

07:54.670 --> 07:58.133
so I hope you have fun working with Rick

07:58.233 --> 08:00.235
after what we did to him.

08:03.878 --> 08:05.500
- Would you let me help with that?
- Nah, I got it.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.981
- Come on. Don't be stupid.
- No, I don't want your help.

08:07.081 --> 08:08.082
- Just let me help with it.
- Don't want your help.

08:08.162 --> 08:09.664
Let go!

08:09.764 --> 08:11.866
You know what? Enough with your help!

08:11.966 --> 08:14.188
You put my name on the script,
dragged me out to L.A.,

08:14.288 --> 08:16.390
you turned federal-fucking-witness.

08:16.490 --> 08:19.873
- Nobody is turning...
- You made a deal with the feds!

08:19.973 --> 08:22.555
And whatever story
you're telling yourself

08:22.656 --> 08:26.659
to make that okay, it's bullshit.

08:30.022 --> 08:34.366
In my family,
no matter how bad things get,

08:34.466 --> 08:36.467
we don't flip.

08:38.991 --> 08:40.572
So do us a favor.

08:40.672 --> 08:42.933
Just stay the fuck away from me.

08:56.046 --> 08:58.108
What I've been saying all along...

08:58.208 --> 08:59.710
it's this pain that just won't go away.

08:59.810 --> 09:00.831
Hmm.

09:00.931 --> 09:03.753
And I thought it was the rotator cuff.

09:03.853 --> 09:04.834
Hmm.

09:04.934 --> 09:06.796
I-I didn't want to tell ya about it.

09:06.896 --> 09:09.719
I don't want you worrying.

09:09.819 --> 09:12.361
The doctor... he wanted an ultrasound.

09:12.461 --> 09:14.123
Mm-hmm.

09:14.223 --> 09:17.926
And then he starts telling me
about in-patient procedures.

09:18.026 --> 09:20.449
Oh? They saying what's wrong?

09:20.549 --> 09:23.171
Benign growth in the muscle.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.974
That's what the biopsy said.

09:26.074 --> 09:29.177
It's all here in the discharge papers.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.619
- Hmm.
- See that picture?

09:31.719 --> 09:34.461
Subscapularis.

09:34.561 --> 09:36.583
Hmm.

09:36.683 --> 09:38.945
Yeah.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.388
And your face?

09:43.730 --> 09:47.433
I tried to get out of bed
before the anesthesia wore off.

09:47.533 --> 09:49.876
- Stupid.
- Poor Ricky.

09:49.976 --> 09:53.199
I think, you know...
a good night's sleep.

09:53.299 --> 09:55.641
- Mm-hmm.
- I think I'm going to feel fine.

09:55.741 --> 09:58.844
Rest. Tomorrow, we start work.

09:58.944 --> 10:00.846
- Work?
- Hmm.

10:00.946 --> 10:02.687
"Wylderness".

10:02.787 --> 10:05.049
Movie Miles brought me.
It's our next project.

10:05.150 --> 10:07.211
Okay, but you don't need me for that.

10:07.311 --> 10:08.653
I do.

10:08.753 --> 10:10.054
You know this business.

10:10.154 --> 10:11.976
You help me, like last time.

10:12.076 --> 10:14.658
I thought I could find something

10:14.758 --> 10:17.181
for you and me to work on,
just the two of us.

10:17.281 --> 10:20.323
After this one.

10:22.085 --> 10:24.087
I'm not sure that I want
to work with Miles again.

10:26.129 --> 10:28.271
Just so soon.

10:28.371 --> 10:30.393
Maybe in a while.

10:30.493 --> 10:32.675
I like this movie.

10:32.775 --> 10:35.397
Why you don't want to do it?

10:42.384 --> 10:45.446
Ricky, what's wrong?

10:45.547 --> 10:48.977
I'm just... I'm sorry.

10:51.112 --> 10:54.935
I'm overwhelmed, that's all.

10:55.035 --> 10:58.258
I... I thought it was over.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.861
Now... Now here I am.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.024
I'm back in our bed.

11:05.124 --> 11:07.627
I'm sorry, sorry.

11:07.727 --> 11:08.948
- I'm just...
- Shhhh.

11:09.048 --> 11:10.509
No, I'm on a lot of pain meds.

11:10.609 --> 11:12.912
- Amara is here now.
- I know.

11:13.012 --> 11:14.753
I take good care of you.

11:14.853 --> 11:16.034
Okay. All right.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.757
I know you will. I know you will.

11:18.857 --> 11:20.959
Oh, Ricky, oh.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.281
I'm all right. I'm all right.

11:23.381 --> 11:25.043
I'm all right.

11:26.784 --> 11:29.527
I'm okay.

11:29.627 --> 11:31.969
It's all right.

11:32.069 --> 11:33.731
- Don't worry.
- Sleep.

11:33.831 --> 11:35.092
I'm going to go to sleep.

11:35.192 --> 11:37.975
You need anything, Emma Jean get it.

11:38.075 --> 11:40.076
And everything's going to be better.

11:54.450 --> 11:55.791
- Mr. Escalones?
- Yeah.

11:55.891 --> 11:57.953
Yeah, guy down the
hallway told me to come.

11:58.053 --> 12:00.055
Have a seat.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.758
This place is really
different than I pictured,

12:03.858 --> 12:05.320
like really different.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.402
In order to transfer the necessary funds

12:08.503 --> 12:09.764
into a dedicated account,

12:09.864 --> 12:11.725
we will be filing
articles of organization

12:11.826 --> 12:13.007
for a new corporation.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.330
Need your signature there and there.

12:16.430 --> 12:19.953
- My signature?
- Mm-hmm.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.982
What did I just sign?

12:30.082 --> 12:32.945
- Mr. Escalones.
- Yeah, hi.

12:33.045 --> 12:35.387
- Who are you?
- Thank you for coming in.

12:35.487 --> 12:37.629
They'll do a better job of explaining,

12:37.729 --> 12:41.593
but since you were the one
who brought us this project,

12:41.693 --> 12:43.114
my colleagues and I felt that

12:43.214 --> 12:46.357
you should be the one to manage it.

12:46.457 --> 12:47.959
Yeah.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.320
Yeah.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.601
Okay.

12:50.701 --> 12:53.123
So, like, what does that mean?

12:53.224 --> 12:55.806
You'll make sure our money
is looked after,

12:55.906 --> 12:58.228
that we get our full return.

13:01.231 --> 13:03.173
Ba-Basically, you're in charge.

13:03.273 --> 13:05.275
How does that sound?

13:05.675 --> 13:07.777
Good.

13:07.877 --> 13:09.979
Yeah. Okay.

13:10.079 --> 13:12.341
I won't let you down.

13:12.441 --> 13:15.404
- Lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

13:17.486 --> 13:20.148
You'll be listed
as the registered agent.

13:20.248 --> 13:23.191
All tax and legal documents
will go through you.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.993
And that box at the top...

13:25.093 --> 13:26.834
if you would write the corporation name.

13:26.934 --> 13:28.075
Okay.

13:28.176 --> 13:29.757
What is it?

13:29.857 --> 13:31.959
Your company, you choose
the name of the LLC.

13:32.059 --> 13:34.061
Me?

13:35.382 --> 13:37.044
Oh, shit.

13:37.144 --> 13:39.846
Okay.

13:39.946 --> 13:43.450
Uh... what's "LLC"?

13:43.550 --> 13:45.551
Limited liability corporation.

13:47.153 --> 13:49.976
Why has it got to be limited?

14:31.434 --> 14:33.856
How long is this going to take?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.818
Hope not too long. I got plans tonight.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.139
You, too?

14:37.239 --> 14:40.615
Been a long day.

14:44.806 --> 14:47.148
We handle whatever you throw at us.

14:47.248 --> 14:49.230
Any kind of weight, quality.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.751
Up front?

14:50.851 --> 14:52.553
Yes, ma'am.

14:52.653 --> 14:54.915
See, we like to create repeat business.

14:55.015 --> 14:56.356
Make everyone happy.

14:56.456 --> 14:58.158
That's just how we do.

14:58.258 --> 15:00.840
How you get it to Nevada?

15:00.941 --> 15:02.442
Got all kind of ways.

15:02.542 --> 15:05.285
Let us worry about that, all right?

15:05.385 --> 15:07.727
No smoke in the car.

15:07.827 --> 15:09.729
Aw, shit. I'm sorry.

15:09.829 --> 15:12.371
That's why it smells good in here.

15:14.193 --> 15:18.176
My car is smoky as fuck...
cigarettes and blunts.

15:18.276 --> 15:19.978
This is a lady's car.

15:20.078 --> 15:22.540
What's that mean? "Lady's car"?

15:22.640 --> 15:25.963
Just... smells good.

15:31.288 --> 15:34.752
If I buy from you instead
of L.A., they won't be happy.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.553
No. No, they won't.

15:36.653 --> 15:39.196
You're not worried?

15:39.296 --> 15:43.079
The people we run with...
next to them, L.A. ain't shit.

15:43.179 --> 15:45.181
You feel me?

15:47.984 --> 15:49.805
Let me think.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.367
I call you.

15:51.467 --> 15:55.070
We'll be waiting.

16:15.088 --> 16:17.711
Got something to say?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.813
I just don't think it's a good idea.

16:24.257 --> 16:27.320
With them, we make more money.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.961
It's not worth the trouble.

16:29.061 --> 16:32.144
Maybe not.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.968
So we continue work with L.A.?

16:36.068 --> 16:38.838
For now.

16:39.511 --> 16:41.212
Go.

16:41.313 --> 16:44.255
And then he says, "Oh, Lulu.
We make another movie.

16:44.355 --> 16:46.457
You can be associate producer."

16:46.557 --> 16:48.859
I know what that fucking means.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.021
There's no "we". It's all about Miles.

16:51.122 --> 16:52.823
Everything is about Miles.

16:52.923 --> 16:56.166
And what about what I want, you know?

16:57.447 --> 16:59.950
- I'm sorry.
- It's cool.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.471
It...

17:01.571 --> 17:04.354
I love talking about your
business partner after sex.

17:05.895 --> 17:09.358
Anyway, that's why I got to move out.

17:09.458 --> 17:11.280
You know, I'm going to find my own place

17:11.380 --> 17:13.602
and just figure out what's next.

17:13.702 --> 17:16.605
It's getting late.
You might as well sleep over.

17:16.704 --> 17:19.287
Ooh.

17:19.387 --> 17:20.888
Hmm.

17:20.989 --> 17:24.852
Do you think my truck is safe
parked on the street?

17:24.953 --> 17:26.694
Like always.

17:26.794 --> 17:28.616
Yeah, but I got all my stuff in it.

17:28.716 --> 17:32.620
Maybe I should... bring it in.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.862
Wait.

17:34.962 --> 17:37.824
You already moved out?

17:37.924 --> 17:39.386
You're not moving in with me?!

17:39.488 --> 17:42.590
No. No. I'll get a place tomorrow.

17:42.610 --> 17:45.399
Taking it slow is not moving in.

17:45.518 --> 17:47.883
Believe me, I understand that.
I'm not...

17:47.931 --> 17:49.875
Bad enough that I'm pregnant,
and now we're fucking married.

17:49.975 --> 17:52.077
We're on the same page!

17:58.183 --> 18:00.325
Move your truck to indoor parking

18:00.425 --> 18:02.287
and bring up one suitcase.

18:02.387 --> 18:04.889
Thank you.

18:07.992 --> 18:09.413
Oh, I got some stuff in boxes.

18:09.513 --> 18:10.815
They're pretty valuable.

18:10.915 --> 18:13.697
One suitcase.

18:13.797 --> 18:15.859
One box.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.822
Okay? That's it.

18:48.549 --> 18:49.970
Yeah?

18:50.071 --> 18:52.072
Hi. It's Miles.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.375
We met a few weeks ago.

18:55.475 --> 18:58.338
I crashed my car,
you set a fire in a toilet.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.980
Quite a fun weekend.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.502
You found me.

19:02.602 --> 19:06.305
It's pretty easy,
once I figured out who you were.

19:06.405 --> 19:09.148
Right, 'cause I didn't
leave you my number.

19:09.248 --> 19:14.153
So that, um, crystal ceremony
that you did with the chakras

19:14.253 --> 19:16.315
and the breathing and whatnot.

19:16.415 --> 19:19.477
Not the kind of thing
I usually sign up for,

19:19.578 --> 19:24.282
but, um... it affected me.

19:26.384 --> 19:28.165
- Still there?
- Yep.

19:28.266 --> 19:33.410
I had kind of a breakthrough or
clarity or whatever you call it,

19:33.510 --> 19:37.734
and I just... I thought
that you should know that,

19:37.834 --> 19:39.496
so I looked you up,

19:39.596 --> 19:42.739
and I figured maybe
we should meet up again.

19:47.308 --> 19:48.384
Your turn.

19:48.484 --> 19:54.149
You looked me up,
so you know I have a husband?

19:54.249 --> 19:56.631
Yes, and you're a costume designer.

19:56.732 --> 19:58.353
I love costumes.

19:58.453 --> 20:00.995
Very underrated part
of the film-production business.

20:01.096 --> 20:02.757
What I'm saying is

20:02.857 --> 20:06.940
is a friendship with you doesn't
really fit in my life right now.

20:06.951 --> 20:08.442
Yeah.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.765
But, um, if things were different...

20:11.865 --> 20:14.808
I get it. Who has time for friendships?

20:20.073 --> 20:24.457
So, um... since we're both so busy,

20:24.557 --> 20:28.180
I guess there's no real need
for us to ever talk again.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.742
Nope. I can't think of one.

20:29.842 --> 20:31.543
Then why aren't you hanging up?

20:31.644 --> 20:34.546
Because I didn't want to be rude.

20:34.646 --> 20:36.628
Consider it.

20:36.728 --> 20:38.069
Okay.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.472
Um....

20:40.572 --> 20:42.794
Take care.

20:42.894 --> 20:45.369
You, too.

20:56.346 --> 20:58.448
Hey. Hi.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.769
Hi.

20:59.869 --> 21:01.291
I didn't realize how late it was.

21:01.391 --> 21:02.452
I let you sleep in.

21:03.913 --> 21:06.496
Ooh. You take it easy today.

21:06.596 --> 21:08.597
Work from home.

21:10.199 --> 21:12.501
- For the pain.
- Oh, thanks.

21:12.601 --> 21:14.623
I should probably just call Gladys,

21:14.723 --> 21:15.824
let her know I'm not coming in.

21:15.924 --> 21:17.426
Mm-hmm.

21:21.529 --> 21:23.431
Wow.

21:23.531 --> 21:25.513
That's really something.

21:25.613 --> 21:31.518
Our first movie together,
and now we do another one.

21:31.619 --> 21:33.320
Right. Right. Yeah.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.282
- Where do you want it?
- I show you.

21:45.751 --> 21:48.934
Sorry I'm late. You got something?

22:02.327 --> 22:04.108
- What's wrong?
- I'm okay.

22:04.208 --> 22:07.351
I think I'm... I'm going to head
into the office after all.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.953
But your shoulder?

22:09.053 --> 22:12.716
A couple of Ibuprofen
and this is going to be okay.

22:12.816 --> 22:14.117
Just... yeah.

22:14.218 --> 22:16.319
Maybe I'll, uh, take a sponge bath,

22:16.420 --> 22:18.121
and then I'll head out.

22:18.221 --> 22:21.224
Huh.

22:33.035 --> 22:35.577
Come on in.

22:35.677 --> 22:37.299
Laurence, this is Miles.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.541
- Pleasure.
- No, pleasure's mine.

22:39.641 --> 22:41.663
You know, I tried for five years

22:41.763 --> 22:43.584
to get this project financed.

22:43.685 --> 22:45.666
April tells me you did it in two days.

22:45.766 --> 22:49.590
- Ah, well. Book sells itself.
- Does it, though?

22:49.690 --> 22:51.952
Well, if you say so,
then I guess it does.

22:52.052 --> 22:57.117
I hope you know how grateful
I am because I love this story.

22:57.217 --> 22:59.559
Oh, I'm right there with you.

23:01.461 --> 23:04.695
Please sit.

23:07.026 --> 23:12.856
You know, uh, I find
stories are like children.

23:15.834 --> 23:18.697
You know what, actually, stories
are nothing like children.

23:18.797 --> 23:21.499
When I started that sentence,
I thought I was on to something.

23:21.599 --> 23:24.124
Well, it worked for me.

23:24.135 --> 23:25.116
Hmm.

23:25.156 --> 23:27.965
So, your investors formed an LLC
and readied the investment,

23:28.045 --> 23:29.787
which is great.

23:29.887 --> 23:33.530
So, if all goes well, we can be
doing this in two years tops.

23:35.132 --> 23:37.714
Two years?

23:37.814 --> 23:40.316
Well, why not?

23:40.417 --> 23:44.040
It's just... I was hoping that
we could get started like now.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.842
How long did "The Revenant"
take to come together?

23:45.942 --> 23:47.163
Ooh, uh...

23:47.263 --> 23:49.965
14 years, okay?

23:50.065 --> 23:53.208
Half our script takes place on a U.S.
Army base.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.850
Now, the good news is,

23:54.950 --> 23:58.453
I was able to secure permission
to shoot at Fort Herlong.

23:58.553 --> 24:01.376
You're familiar with...
It's spectacular.

24:01.476 --> 24:03.738
Got full access to the air field,

24:03.838 --> 24:09.143
military equipment, vehicles,
but not for at least 18 months.

24:09.243 --> 24:10.624
Okay.

24:10.724 --> 24:14.668
Okay, so it's the army base
that's the... right.

24:14.768 --> 24:17.030
- What about a different location?
- You know what?

24:17.130 --> 24:19.793
Every time I try to cut corners,
I end up regretting it.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.474
- Why even do it, then?
- Do you?

24:21.574 --> 24:24.677
Trust me, you see Fort Herlong,
you'll be glad you waited...

24:24.777 --> 24:26.439
- Hey, Amanda.
- Hi.

24:26.539 --> 24:29.682
- How you doing?
- Good. This is Gerard and Lyle.

24:29.782 --> 24:31.684
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hold on one second.

24:31.784 --> 24:33.565
Uh, so keep in touch.

24:33.665 --> 24:36.688
We'll meet up again, say, July,
and we'll see where we're at.

24:36.788 --> 24:38.009
Thanks.

24:38.109 --> 24:39.771
Guys? Have a seat.

24:39.871 --> 24:42.013
Thank you.

24:42.113 --> 24:44.776
So, what did you think
of the dailies, huh?

24:44.876 --> 24:47.698
I can tell, he's crushing it, is he not?

24:47.798 --> 24:50.501
You told me if I got the money,
it was a done deal.

24:50.601 --> 24:52.022
That wasn't a "no", exactly.

24:52.122 --> 24:54.064
Hell, it wasn't a "yes"!

24:54.164 --> 24:57.707
April, I made certain
assurances to people.

24:57.807 --> 25:00.230
If this movie doesn't happen and soon...

25:00.330 --> 25:03.032
I'll make some calls, see if we
can figure out an alternative.

25:03.132 --> 25:04.594
He was pretty clear.

25:04.694 --> 25:06.075
No army base, no movie.

25:06.175 --> 25:07.877
So we find a different army base

25:07.977 --> 25:10.679
or a visual-effects team
willing to work for peanuts or..

25:10.779 --> 25:12.801
...something.

25:12.901 --> 25:15.404
Look, this is the first project
I have brought to this company.

25:15.504 --> 25:17.806
I'm not going to let it go
after one meeting.

25:17.906 --> 25:20.328
Just give me a few hours,

25:20.428 --> 25:22.630
then let's get together,
go through out options.

25:23.831 --> 25:24.852
Tonight.

25:24.952 --> 25:27.595
I'll let you know when.

25:29.957 --> 25:31.538
She's out, but she'll be back.

25:31.638 --> 25:34.621
- Just hang out.
- Message sounded urgent.

25:34.721 --> 25:36.743
Any idea when she'll be back?

25:36.843 --> 25:39.506
- Nope.
- Perfect.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.378
Shh.

26:14.478 --> 26:15.899
I'm not going to hurt you.

26:15.999 --> 26:17.901
This... This hurts, right now.

26:18.001 --> 26:19.262
What you're doing right now.

26:20.884 --> 26:23.546
Keep your voice down,
and I'll let you go.

26:23.646 --> 26:25.548
Okay?

26:29.211 --> 26:31.794
You don't look so bad.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.876
How's the shoulder?

26:33.976 --> 26:36.558
Feels like I got shot, okay?

26:36.658 --> 26:39.561
I... I barely slept
because all I could think of

26:39.661 --> 26:41.362
was that fucking bag on my head!

26:41.462 --> 26:42.724
Easy.

26:42.824 --> 26:43.885
I thought we were friends, huh?!

26:43.985 --> 26:46.407
Then... Then that happened.

26:46.507 --> 26:49.890
I-I'm greatly affected by this, okay?

26:49.990 --> 26:51.892
I feel very betrayed.

26:51.992 --> 26:54.895
You feel betrayed?

26:54.995 --> 26:58.818
You, me, and Lulu...
we're in this together.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.700
One of us fucks up, we all go down,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.902
and it won't be pills in a bag
over our head,

27:03.002 --> 27:05.384
it will be a fuck of a lot uglier.

27:05.484 --> 27:07.486
Do you understand?

27:12.491 --> 27:14.953
Where are you going?

27:15.053 --> 27:18.376
Work.

28:36.768 --> 28:39.791
Okay.

28:42.093 --> 28:43.234
What happened?

28:43.334 --> 28:44.996
Oh.

28:45.096 --> 28:47.278
Oh, I got shot, yeah.

28:47.378 --> 28:49.079
You know how that is. It's...

28:49.179 --> 28:50.401
Right.

28:50.501 --> 28:52.242
So, how about I give you my favorite?

28:52.342 --> 28:54.004
Chocolate with sprinkles.

28:54.104 --> 28:56.046
Okay, let's do this. Yeah.

28:58.348 --> 29:02.532
Wow, you got a whole... technique.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.414
You're good.

29:05.514 --> 29:07.216
If I tried that, yeah,
it would be chaos.

29:07.316 --> 29:09.738
There would be sprinkles, and
I'd start a fire or something.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.902
Wow, this is great.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.565
This...

29:18.646 --> 29:21.950
I've had a rough couple days,
and I came,

29:22.050 --> 29:26.273
and I saw this truck, and... and you.

29:26.374 --> 29:29.036
Yeah, this is just what I needed.

29:30.537 --> 29:31.959
I'm here all week.

29:32.059 --> 29:34.041
Oh.

29:34.141 --> 29:37.043
Okay. Thank you.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.892
Hey. Ed said you wanted...

29:46.992 --> 29:48.994
Sit.

29:50.636 --> 29:53.098
You got something you want to tell me?

29:53.198 --> 29:54.299
What do you mean?

29:54.399 --> 29:55.981
You bring me a movie.

29:56.081 --> 29:58.863
- Yeah.
- Don't say nothing about Yago.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.185
Right.

30:01.286 --> 30:02.547
Well.

30:02.647 --> 30:04.949
Turns out Yago is working with L.A.

30:05.049 --> 30:08.072
I know. You think I don't know?

30:08.172 --> 30:09.673
So...

30:09.773 --> 30:11.995
Why does he work on my movie?

30:12.095 --> 30:14.518
I don't think he does,
at least not directly.

30:14.618 --> 30:15.799
He say he does.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.280
He tell you that?

30:17.380 --> 30:20.003
- Told Ross.
- Did he?

30:20.103 --> 30:23.086
Said his company runs the movie...

30:23.186 --> 30:25.207
Yago Unlimited Limited.

30:25.308 --> 30:26.969
It's called what?

30:27.069 --> 30:31.093
- Yago Unlimited...
- No, I heard you.

30:31.193 --> 30:36.017
Why his company make my movie?

30:36.117 --> 30:39.020
Well, this is the first
I'm hearing about it.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.222
I mean, I knew he was
involved in some capacity.

30:41.322 --> 30:43.704
I am executive producer.

30:43.805 --> 30:45.786
And that doesn't change.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.948
L.A. is just an investor.

30:48.048 --> 30:49.550
I don't know what their arrangement is

30:49.650 --> 30:51.111
with Yago exactly,

30:51.211 --> 30:53.593
and they can call the company
whatever they like.

30:53.694 --> 30:55.035
It doesn't mean that he's in charge.

30:55.135 --> 30:56.902
You are.

30:56.998 --> 30:59.119
At least, more than him.

30:59.219 --> 31:03.763
I realize things are tense
between you and L.A. right now,

31:03.863 --> 31:08.007
but we all are in business together.

31:08.107 --> 31:11.990
We all want to make a great film.

31:20.558 --> 31:21.939
That it?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.461
Guess so.

31:23.561 --> 31:26.323
She not going to do anything rash?

31:28.045 --> 31:31.128
I'll just let myself out, then.

31:34.171 --> 31:36.393
Step outside so we can talk.

31:36.493 --> 31:39.736
Sorry, I'm working.

31:52.548 --> 31:56.171
Ooh!

31:56.271 --> 31:58.653
So, basically, they recognize

31:58.753 --> 32:00.575
when someone has a feel for business,

32:00.675 --> 32:02.256
and they looked at me

32:02.356 --> 32:06.180
and they were like, "This dude
right here is a resource".

32:06.280 --> 32:09.263
We need someone
to oversee this shit, so...

32:22.935 --> 32:25.298
Tia.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.181
Been a while.

32:30.582 --> 32:32.004
You live here?

32:32.104 --> 32:33.725
Ross ain't tell ya?

32:33.825 --> 32:35.207
He told me.

32:35.307 --> 32:39.130
Shit is only temporary
until I get my own place.

32:39.230 --> 32:41.132
A place in L.A.?

32:41.232 --> 32:42.894
Yeah.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.616
'Cause you work for L.A. now.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.858
That what you want to talk to me about?

32:47.958 --> 32:52.743
I mean, I didn't have a choice.

32:52.843 --> 32:54.845
You kicked me out.
I had to make a living.

32:55.325 --> 32:57.107
This a living?

32:57.207 --> 33:00.350
L.A. came to me.

33:00.450 --> 33:02.111
With my movie.

33:02.211 --> 33:03.753
Your movie?

33:03.853 --> 33:05.975
They're the ones paying for it, right?

33:07.376 --> 33:09.638
You heard they put me in charge?

33:09.738 --> 33:14.082
This where you sleeping, on the couch?

33:14.182 --> 33:17.645
Tia, I work for L.A. now, okay?

33:17.746 --> 33:20.288
You can't just come up in here,
talk to me like this.

33:20.388 --> 33:22.090
You got to show respect.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.773
Ross invite me.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.295
This not your place.

33:28.395 --> 33:33.881
Why you think that concha
put you in charge?

33:36.843 --> 33:40.867
To fuck with me, that's why.

33:45.811 --> 33:52.197
You got anything else to
tell me while I'm here?

33:52.297 --> 33:54.299
To my face?

34:08.871 --> 34:10.534
Tastes like shit.

34:23.606 --> 34:26.308
No more product from L.A. I am done.

34:26.408 --> 34:29.231
Call Wardell.
Say I'm ready to do business.

34:29.331 --> 34:31.833
- You sure?
- L.A. fuck with me.

34:31.934 --> 34:33.554
Now I fuck with them.

34:33.655 --> 34:36.237
So, if we can't get Fort Herlong,

34:36.338 --> 34:39.000
there's Concord Naval Weapon Station,

34:39.100 --> 34:41.121
decommissioned in '02.

34:41.222 --> 34:43.224
No air field.

34:43.664 --> 34:46.167
And no active military vehicles.

34:46.266 --> 34:47.527
What about CGI?

34:47.628 --> 34:49.570
We could hire a Chinese
company, but honestly,

34:49.670 --> 34:51.251
we don't have the budget for that.

34:53.754 --> 34:57.257
I mean, even if we could
live with one of these,

34:57.357 --> 34:59.619
there's no way Laurence comes along.

34:59.719 --> 35:03.262
No, probably not.

35:06.926 --> 35:08.387
I should go

35:08.487 --> 35:10.349
read the scripts I was
supposed to read this afternoon,

35:10.449 --> 35:14.052
or Laurence will flip his wig literally.

35:15.133 --> 35:17.075
Did you not notice?

35:17.175 --> 35:18.877
Laurence wears a wig?

35:18.977 --> 35:20.798
It's a medical condition.

35:20.898 --> 35:23.401
He doesn't have a hair on his body.

35:23.501 --> 35:24.882
Glues on eyebrows.

35:24.982 --> 35:27.004
Fuck off.

35:27.104 --> 35:31.268
His whole body, even on his... ooh.

35:32.349 --> 35:34.010
Hey.

35:34.111 --> 35:36.973
I'm not going to give up on this movie.

35:37.073 --> 35:38.294
Neither should you.

35:38.394 --> 35:40.256
Yeah.

35:40.356 --> 35:46.382
Worst-case scenario...
we make the film in two years.

35:46.482 --> 35:48.484
That's not so bad.

35:49.885 --> 35:53.308
Laurence can get Fort Herlong
in two years.

35:53.408 --> 35:55.190
How's he pulling that off?

35:55.290 --> 35:57.312
It's about who you know, right?

35:57.412 --> 35:59.234
Laurence knows everyone.

36:13.346 --> 36:15.088
You're back late.

36:15.188 --> 36:17.610
How did the apartment search go?

36:17.710 --> 36:20.293
We're off to a real good start.

36:20.393 --> 36:22.095
I don't know where you're looking,

36:22.195 --> 36:24.737
but I got some friends
who really like North Hollywood.

36:24.837 --> 36:27.219
Huh. I'm also looking around here.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.321
Korea Town?

36:30.242 --> 36:31.743
Which part?

36:31.843 --> 36:35.747
Uh, north... Korea Town.

36:35.847 --> 36:37.469
- You didn't look.
- I did.

36:37.569 --> 36:39.110
Bought a newspaper.

36:39.210 --> 36:42.713
You're looking in a newspaper
for an apartment?

36:42.813 --> 36:44.755
I meant what I said yesterday.
I haven't had a roommate

36:44.855 --> 36:46.357
since my 20s. I'm not doing that again.

36:46.457 --> 36:47.918
I meant to look.

36:48.018 --> 36:49.920
I just... I got really
distracted with work stuff.

36:50.020 --> 36:52.322
Are you writing something new?

36:52.422 --> 36:53.964
- Yes.
- No laptop?

36:54.064 --> 36:56.566
Notebook is in the truck.

36:58.228 --> 37:00.490
What's the new thing about?

37:00.590 --> 37:02.451
Well, I'm just getting into it...

37:02.552 --> 37:05.234
arranging the cards,
you know, in my head.

37:06.635 --> 37:10.139
I'm ordering take-out.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.491
Didn't think we'd be
hearing from you so soon.

37:45.591 --> 37:48.133
Yeah, I just got some news.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.615
Happy to pass it along.

37:49.715 --> 37:52.577
Well, I had a sit-down
with Laurence Budd

37:52.678 --> 37:56.541
about "Wylderness" today...
he could not be more excited.

37:56.641 --> 37:59.504
One little hitch...
the location that we need

37:59.604 --> 38:02.426
is not available
until two years from now.

38:02.527 --> 38:03.988
So...

38:04.088 --> 38:05.629
Plan is still the same,

38:05.729 --> 38:08.392
only the timing's not what we'd hoped.

38:08.492 --> 38:10.754
When you spoke to Agent Dillard,

38:10.854 --> 38:12.516
didn't you say the project
had a green light?

38:12.616 --> 38:16.119
Which it does, soon as
we secure this location.

38:16.219 --> 38:17.400
What's the location?

38:17.500 --> 38:19.442
Um...

38:19.542 --> 38:21.544
Herlong Army Base.

38:22.104 --> 38:24.447
What do you need, exactly?

38:24.547 --> 38:28.470
Pretty much full access
for three, maybe four weeks.

38:29.551 --> 38:33.975
You want a month of full access
to an active military base?

38:34.075 --> 38:36.017
What was your name again?

38:36.117 --> 38:37.459
Stevenson.

38:37.559 --> 38:39.580
- Can I call you Steve?
- No.

38:39.681 --> 38:42.023
Here's the thing.

38:42.123 --> 38:46.066
What is the point
in having friends in high places

38:46.167 --> 38:49.550
if they can't help you out
once in a while?

38:49.650 --> 38:51.792
Or...

38:51.892 --> 38:55.475
we wait until next year.

38:55.575 --> 38:57.437
Up to you.

38:59.339 --> 39:01.681
I'll check with the office.

39:01.781 --> 39:03.803
Fantastic.

39:03.903 --> 39:06.405
You just let me know, Steve.

39:16.875 --> 39:18.456
What about dessert?

39:18.556 --> 39:20.578
They do that green-tea sundae.

39:20.678 --> 39:23.220
Or we can stop for some frozen yogurt.

39:23.321 --> 39:26.023
Mom. What's going on?

39:28.365 --> 39:31.268
I started talking with lawyers,

39:31.368 --> 39:36.413
and, um, I'm planning to ask
for full custody.

39:38.895 --> 39:42.258
I wanted to ask
your feelings about that.

39:45.621 --> 39:48.083
You want me to side with you?

39:48.183 --> 39:50.085
That's... That's why we're here.

39:50.185 --> 39:51.606
No.

39:51.707 --> 39:53.488
No, first, I... I
thought it would be fun

39:53.588 --> 39:54.729
to have a girls' night.

39:54.829 --> 39:57.612
Mom, every night's girls' night now.

39:57.712 --> 39:59.754
Okay.

40:00.835 --> 40:02.617
I'm not agreeing to this.

40:02.717 --> 40:04.258
You'll still be able to see your dad.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.480
Oh, but not sleep over?

40:08.762 --> 40:11.224
Your father is a great guy.

40:11.325 --> 40:14.427
But remember what Helen said

40:14.527 --> 40:17.510
about trusting people
who've let you down.

40:17.610 --> 40:19.632
Helen also said I get to decide

40:19.732 --> 40:21.874
what's best for my emotional health.

40:21.974 --> 40:23.476
And I think what's best

40:23.576 --> 40:25.918
is that I get to live
with Dad half the time.

40:38.189 --> 40:39.530
Hello?

40:39.630 --> 40:41.652
I know we said we'd never talk again.

40:41.752 --> 40:43.334
We said that, didn't we?

40:43.434 --> 40:47.097
It's just I have some queries
about some costume stuff.

40:47.197 --> 40:48.539
No, you don't.

40:48.639 --> 40:51.341
You don't think our chats
are a good idea?

40:51.441 --> 40:53.663
Oh, I'd go beyond that.

40:53.763 --> 40:56.346
- Would you?
- Yeah.

40:56.446 --> 41:01.150
I'd say talking to you
is exactly what I don't need.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.673
Oh, I totally agree, but I do
have some of your stuff.

41:04.774 --> 41:06.675
I've been feeling bad about that.

41:06.775 --> 41:10.359
What I've been told
is a very powerful crystal...

41:10.459 --> 41:12.160
Uh-huh. That was a gift.

41:12.260 --> 41:15.163
There's also a photograph
of you with a tiger.

41:15.263 --> 41:17.285
I'm pretty sure I burned that.

41:17.385 --> 41:18.926
Uh, there's a bit left.

41:19.027 --> 41:20.928
We should probably arrange to meet up

41:21.028 --> 41:22.690
so I can get
these precious items back to you

41:22.790 --> 41:24.171
sometime we're both free.

41:24.271 --> 41:26.213
Oh, but we're so busy.

41:26.313 --> 41:27.935
That is a problem.

41:28.035 --> 41:30.617
So maybe I should just
give them to you now.

41:30.717 --> 41:34.180
Yeah, but I'm at my studio,
and it's way out of the way.

41:34.281 --> 41:37.704
Oh, it's no trouble
since I'm only 50 feet away.

41:37.804 --> 41:39.806
What?

41:40.887 --> 41:43.389
Gray Buick down the street.

41:43.489 --> 41:45.811
Other way.

41:50.455 --> 41:51.957
Hello.

41:52.057 --> 41:54.099
Hi.

41:55.820 --> 41:57.041
Glad you're smiling.

41:57.142 --> 41:59.203
I was worried you might
phone the police,

41:59.303 --> 42:01.305
tell them you have a stalker.

42:05.829 --> 42:08.212
Where's my stuff?

42:08.312 --> 42:10.213
Agh. You know what?

42:10.314 --> 42:11.655
I just realized.

42:11.755 --> 42:13.917
I fucking forgot them at home.

42:29.771 --> 42:31.993
Okay, this happens once.

42:32.094 --> 42:35.196
One time, never again.

42:35.296 --> 42:36.998
Yeah. Okay.

42:37.098 --> 42:38.439
Okay.

42:38.539 --> 42:40.842
Put your seat back.

43:08.367 --> 43:10.228
What's up, dawg?

43:10.329 --> 43:12.611
Could use some help with a job.

43:15.413 --> 43:18.836
- Oh, shit.
- Need you to be a lookout.

43:18.936 --> 43:22.079
Let us know when
this motherfucker walks out.

43:22.179 --> 43:25.522
This dude... can't miss him.

43:25.623 --> 43:27.604
Yeah?

43:27.704 --> 43:29.806
Yeah, okay.

43:29.907 --> 43:31.908
Let's do it.

43:32.789 --> 43:34.050
All right.

43:39.916 --> 43:42.298
Don't like it?

43:42.398 --> 43:45.060
No, no. It's great.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.503
You don't look happy.

43:47.603 --> 43:49.825
Well, my shoulder's throbbing.

43:49.925 --> 43:52.407
How about you? Feeling good?

43:55.410 --> 43:58.753
You know my nephew.

43:58.853 --> 44:02.316
He go and work for someone else.

44:02.416 --> 44:05.839
- I thought you fired him.
- So?

44:05.940 --> 44:07.761
Yeah, I get it.

44:07.861 --> 44:09.763
You're very close.

44:09.863 --> 44:14.327
You're much closer
than me and son ever were.

44:14.427 --> 44:17.951
Hey, you're going to work it out.

44:19.632 --> 44:22.535
You're a good man, Ricky.

44:22.635 --> 44:26.498
Other men I've been with...
they don't take care of me.

44:26.598 --> 44:29.942
You know, with my ex-wives...

44:30.042 --> 44:31.343
Mm-hmm?

44:31.443 --> 44:33.865
...it just always got to a point

44:33.965 --> 44:37.528
where we stopped
listening to each other.

44:38.609 --> 44:43.554
It would be different
with us, don't you think?

44:43.654 --> 44:46.817
- What?
- If we got married.

44:49.900 --> 44:51.922
That's a thought.

44:53.463 --> 44:56.206
It's fun to think about those things.

44:56.306 --> 44:58.768
- Mm-hmm.
- Future things.

44:58.868 --> 45:01.671
- Mm-hmm.
- Isn't it? Yeah.

45:05.234 --> 45:06.775
Yeah, oh, gosh.

45:06.875 --> 45:09.818
You know my... my shoulder's
really throbbing.

45:09.918 --> 45:12.220
- Oh.
- I think it might be the heat.

45:12.320 --> 45:15.904
I'm going to get out right now.
You stay, stay. Stay.

45:16.004 --> 45:17.385
Enjoy yourself.

45:17.485 --> 45:20.688
I just got to get out now.

45:47.633 --> 45:50.716
Get in the car!

45:56.721 --> 45:58.182
We lit him up!

45:58.282 --> 45:59.744
Who was he?

45:59.844 --> 46:01.666
Runs 15th Street.

46:01.766 --> 46:03.427
Yeah? What did he do?

46:03.527 --> 46:05.950
Tried to sell to your auntie,
that's what he did.

46:06.050 --> 46:07.431
But hold on.

46:07.531 --> 46:09.072
Does my tia know?

46:09.172 --> 46:11.174
She will soon.

46:25.067 --> 46:27.790
This is usually the part
where you get out.

46:29.311 --> 46:31.573
Have you been talking to Mom?

46:31.673 --> 46:33.575
Not on a daily basis, no.

46:33.675 --> 46:36.838
You know she got a lawyer?

46:38.559 --> 46:40.581
She's gonna fight you for custody.

46:40.681 --> 46:42.103
Yeah, I know.

46:42.203 --> 46:44.385
I thought that was probably
where we were headed.

46:44.485 --> 46:46.487
Do you have a lawyer?

46:47.808 --> 46:51.505
Dad, you need one
if you're going to fight this.

46:52.012 --> 46:54.034
Is that what you want?

46:54.134 --> 46:55.435
I barely see you already.

46:55.535 --> 46:57.477
If I'm not going to sleep over...

46:57.577 --> 46:59.519
- And the bed's crap anyway.
- Dad.

46:59.619 --> 47:03.482
I don't want you
worrying about it, okay?

47:03.582 --> 47:07.106
Me and your mother...
we'll figure things out.

47:09.748 --> 47:13.612
Or me and you could drive
to Mexico right now.

47:13.712 --> 47:15.693
I have a quiz in French.

47:15.794 --> 47:17.535
- Oh! Shoot.
- Yeah.

47:17.635 --> 47:19.016
Forgot about that.

47:19.117 --> 47:20.418
Stupid school.

47:20.518 --> 47:22.860
Go on, then. Go and learn something.

47:39.615 --> 47:41.317
Hello?

47:41.417 --> 47:43.519
Got some news about your request.

47:43.619 --> 47:45.841
Let's hear it, then.

47:48.343 --> 47:51.086
- You're back.
- Yeah, yeah.

47:51.186 --> 47:53.968
The doctor told me I need
more potassium in my diet, so...

47:54.069 --> 47:55.290
Hmm.

47:55.390 --> 47:56.731
Well, congratulations on
a hundred episodes.

47:56.831 --> 47:58.893
- That's a big deal.
- Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah.

47:58.993 --> 48:01.435
Yeah, thanks.

48:02.556 --> 48:03.978
Don't tell anyone,

48:04.078 --> 48:06.500
but I'm one of those freaks
that doesn't own a TV.

48:06.600 --> 48:07.781
Well, listen.

48:07.881 --> 48:09.703
If we're sharing secrets,

48:09.803 --> 48:12.546
I don't work for "Compton Justice".

48:12.646 --> 48:15.068
Oh, you're a freeloader,
a banana freeloader.

48:15.168 --> 48:18.326
- Don't cut me off, please.
- I'm going to tell my manager.

48:18.366 --> 48:20.152
Who, the top banana?

48:20.253 --> 48:22.475
That's funny.

48:22.575 --> 48:24.717
Yeah. Funny and handsome.

48:24.817 --> 48:26.078
I'm the total package.

48:26.178 --> 48:28.680
Yeah, well, would you like the usual?

48:28.780 --> 48:30.322
Well, you know what? Surprise me.

48:30.422 --> 48:32.324
Yeah. Go crazy.

48:32.424 --> 48:35.607
- I'm going to go crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.

48:37.308 --> 48:38.970
On Tuesday nights,

48:39.070 --> 48:41.332
my housemates and I go to this
place called the Smokehouse.

48:41.432 --> 48:44.875
You ever want to eat
something besides bananas...

48:47.437 --> 48:50.020
Maybe I'll see you there sometime.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.842
Yeah. Maybe you will.

48:54.684 --> 48:55.945
Thanks.

48:56.045 --> 48:58.347
Enjoy.

49:01.090 --> 49:03.312
- Aah, back already.
- Couldn't stay away.

49:03.412 --> 49:04.593
I'll get back to you.

49:04.693 --> 49:06.315
Soon. All right.

49:06.415 --> 49:08.357
Please sit.

49:08.457 --> 49:11.239
So, Miles got us Fort Herlong.

49:11.339 --> 49:13.441
Starting immediately.

49:13.541 --> 49:15.763
- Really?
- Yeah, full access.

49:15.864 --> 49:17.765
Are you sure? Because
the way the Army works,

49:17.865 --> 49:19.567
you usually need
a lot of signatures before...

49:19.667 --> 49:22.730
Yeah, I got a signed consent
form here from Colonel Travis.

49:22.830 --> 49:24.251
He's the base commander over at...

49:24.351 --> 49:26.353
Yes, I know, I know who he is.

49:28.155 --> 49:29.736
So if that's the only thing
holding us back,

49:29.836 --> 49:31.258
we can move forward now, right?

49:31.358 --> 49:35.622
Well, perhaps I wasn't...
clear yesterday.

49:35.722 --> 49:37.063
About?

49:37.163 --> 49:41.027
Well, it's not simply the issue
with Fort Herlong.

49:41.127 --> 49:44.390
I also have two studio films
in active production.

49:44.490 --> 49:46.031
I have another six in development.

49:46.131 --> 49:48.834
I've got a Broadway transfer
from the West End,

49:48.934 --> 49:51.276
which needs a marquee star
in order to recoup,

49:51.376 --> 49:54.159
so the earliest I could possibly
take on a new project

49:54.259 --> 49:56.261
is two years.

50:00.264 --> 50:02.848
I thought you said if we had the base...

50:02.896 --> 50:04.234
No, no, no.

50:04.245 --> 50:05.869
I'm really sorry I wasn't clear.

50:06.470 --> 50:09.413
It's just...

50:09.513 --> 50:12.856
My investor was... was
banking on making a movie...

50:12.956 --> 50:15.979
You know, I do not want
to disappoint Mr. de Escalones,

50:16.079 --> 50:19.422
but I'm sure he's familiar with
the concept of opportunity cost.

50:19.522 --> 50:22.064
If I were to take even
a few minutes of my attention

50:22.164 --> 50:25.667
from any of my active projects,
it comes at a cost.

50:25.768 --> 50:27.109
They're waiting for you.

50:27.209 --> 50:29.111
So what I said yesterday still stands.

50:29.211 --> 50:31.833
I'm willing to sit down in a few months.

50:31.948 --> 50:35.213
Mr. Budd, the thing is

50:35.229 --> 50:37.411
the money won't be there
in a few months.

50:37.480 --> 50:38.781
The investors won't wait.

50:38.792 --> 50:40.291
It's got to be now or never.

50:40.335 --> 50:42.037
Well, I'm not saying it's never,

50:42.146 --> 50:44.548
but I'm afraid now
just does not work for me.

50:48.872 --> 50:50.974
- I'm sorry.
- I'll talk to him. It'll...

50:51.074 --> 50:52.936
Miles, he told us where he stands.

50:53.036 --> 50:54.377
Miles!

50:54.477 --> 50:55.979
Let go.

50:56.079 --> 50:57.500
You'll get me fired.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.142
- No, I won't.
- Please.

50:59.242 --> 51:01.544
- Miles!
- Mr. Budd?

51:01.644 --> 51:05.107
I've got a dinner, and I've
already kept my ride waiting.

51:05.207 --> 51:06.749
I'll be brief.

51:11.853 --> 51:14.916
Gonna tell you why
you can fit this project in.

51:15.016 --> 51:16.517
All right.

51:16.618 --> 51:18.880
'Cause I'm going to be
the man running it.

51:18.980 --> 51:21.562
- Hmm.
- The base is just the beginning.

51:21.662 --> 51:24.805
My last film, I turned
a $2 million private investment

51:24.905 --> 51:28.809
into a $30 million studio
picture that didn't just recoup,

51:28.909 --> 51:30.530
it turned a profit.

51:30.630 --> 51:32.132
I get things done.

51:32.232 --> 51:33.813
Yes, I've heard.

51:33.913 --> 51:36.135
Well, I heard about you, too.

51:36.236 --> 51:37.897
That you got a rate
you didn't like on a film,

51:37.997 --> 51:40.379
so you threatened
the what do you call them...

51:40.479 --> 51:42.581
The president of the MPAA.

51:42.681 --> 51:44.743
And I-I didn't threaten him physically.

51:44.843 --> 51:46.185
See, you and me...

51:46.285 --> 51:48.026
we'll do whatever it takes
to make shit happen.

51:48.126 --> 51:49.908
Chase people through hallways?

51:50.008 --> 51:51.389
Exactly.

51:55.894 --> 51:57.915
Holy shit!

51:58.016 --> 52:00.718
This is your ride?

52:00.818 --> 52:03.501
- Where's dinner?
- Monterey.

52:04.662 --> 52:06.603
So, what do you want from me, Miles?

52:06.703 --> 52:10.407
I want a guarantee
that this film is happening.

52:10.507 --> 52:13.029
Now, not two years from now.

52:16.032 --> 52:18.174
All right.

52:18.274 --> 52:19.936
Really?

52:20.036 --> 52:22.618
If you're willing to take the reins,

52:22.718 --> 52:24.540
I'm not going to stop you.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.422
It's easier to say yes now

52:26.522 --> 52:30.425
than to have you storm my office
every day.

53:17.008 --> 53:18.589
Louis!

53:18.689 --> 53:20.031
Hey.

53:20.131 --> 53:22.133
How was your day?

53:22.973 --> 53:25.396
This was your plan the whole time.

53:25.496 --> 53:27.397
What's that?

53:27.498 --> 53:29.239
You were never
going to find your own place.

53:29.339 --> 53:30.921
I made some calls. I...

53:31.021 --> 53:33.443
I said one bag, one box!

53:33.543 --> 53:35.125
You've already moved in.

53:35.225 --> 53:38.007
Well, I needed my shower stuff,
and... and my warm socks...

53:38.107 --> 53:39.889
Are you even writing anything?!

53:39.989 --> 53:42.932
I'm feeling kind of blocked lately.

53:43.032 --> 53:44.613
Why don't you call your agent

53:44.713 --> 53:45.894
and have them set you up
with a re-write?

53:45.994 --> 53:47.616
At least then you would have
some income!

53:47.716 --> 53:49.257
Honestly...

53:49.358 --> 53:51.900
I'm not sure I'm into
the whole writing thing.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.742
I think I'm just going to branch out,

53:53.842 --> 53:55.263
find something new.

53:55.363 --> 53:58.066
So, as of now, you have no career,

53:58.166 --> 54:01.669
no place to live.

54:01.769 --> 54:05.893
We're married, and I'm
pregnant with your child.

54:07.014 --> 54:09.276
I'm going to get a glass of wine.

54:09.376 --> 54:11.037
Oh, you can't drink.

54:11.138 --> 54:13.139
You watch me.

54:14.621 --> 54:17.283
- Hello?
- I want to talk to Lila.

54:17.383 --> 54:19.525
And who may I ask is calling?

54:19.625 --> 54:21.967
- She'll know.
- Hold, please.

54:33.638 --> 54:34.859
Hello?

54:34.959 --> 54:36.180
The fuck do you think you're doing?

54:36.281 --> 54:38.302
You bought product
from another supplier.

54:38.402 --> 54:40.464
You had to know it would end this way.

54:40.564 --> 54:42.306
What now? You're cutting me off?

54:42.406 --> 54:43.787
On the contrary.

54:43.888 --> 54:45.589
But we are doubling your tax.

54:45.689 --> 54:47.070
Double?

54:47.171 --> 54:49.553
To de-incentivize
any future bargain-hunting.

54:49.653 --> 54:51.715
I don't pay 10%.

54:51.815 --> 54:53.276
You'll let me know
if you change your mind.

55:07.189 --> 55:09.191
It's open.
