01:26.720 --> 01:28.522
What are you doing?

01:28.555 --> 01:30.557
I'm gonna put ice cream
in the punch.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.158
You don't
put it in now!

01:32.192 --> 01:34.460
It's gonna melt
before Balki gets here.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.863
Well, you‐you're
putting the soda in!

01:36.897 --> 01:38.532
Soda doesn't melt.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.601
Don't you know anything
about making punch?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.769
Hello, I can
make a punch!

01:45.606 --> 01:48.709
M‐maybe, I should have gone
down to the school with Balki.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.844
Uh, he was so nervous.

01:50.877 --> 01:53.346
Larry, you can't take
his entrance exam for him.

01:53.379 --> 01:55.215
It's just one of those things
has to do on his own.

01:55.248 --> 01:58.685
But getting into college
is so important to Balki.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.223
Gosh! Balki going to college?

02:03.256 --> 02:05.926
It seems like he just
graduated from high school.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.360
He did just graduate
from high school.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.564
Oh, right.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.569
You know, I don't know what
the big deal is about college?

02:15.602 --> 02:17.437
I went to college
and other than learning

02:17.470 --> 02:19.873
how complex hydrocarbons are
broken down to make glyceride

02:19.906 --> 02:21.642
I didn't get
anything out of it.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.549
Alright, Balki
going to college.

02:28.582 --> 02:32.385
Duh, I can't believe
he's come so far so fast.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.387
And if you had seen him when he
first walked through my door

02:34.420 --> 02:36.623
you‐you wouldn't have thought
he was college material.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.564
Am I looking up
Larry Appleton?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.899
Larry Appleton.
That's me.

02:45.932 --> 02:49.335
Larry, Larry, Larry!

02:49.369 --> 02:51.204
I look
everywhere for you!

02:51.237 --> 02:53.840
I walked the streets,
I searched the alleys.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.843
I say to everyone,
"Have you seen Larry?"

02:56.877 --> 02:59.913
You don't know how many people
have never heard of you!

03:01.748 --> 03:03.584
But now I find you

03:03.617 --> 03:05.586
and I'm safe, I'm safe!

03:05.619 --> 03:08.555
Yes, yes,
now you're safe.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.491
Who are you?

03:11.525 --> 03:13.827
I'm Balki Bartokomous.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.429
Philo, my fifth cousin,
three times removed

03:16.462 --> 03:18.865
is a step‐uncle to your father
on my mother's side

03:18.899 --> 03:20.534
two continents removed.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.736
I see, so we're
sort of related by rumor.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.709
[sighs]
America.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.445
Land of my dreams..

03:32.478 --> 03:34.347
...home of the whopper.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.621
You mean, that's why you two
got to be roommates?

03:40.654 --> 03:41.988
Balki just showed up
on your doorstep one day?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.423
Yeah.

03:43.456 --> 03:46.026
He was a real babe
in the woods.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.528
Yeah, if I hadn't taken
him under my wing

03:47.561 --> 03:48.762
there's‐there's no telling

03:48.795 --> 03:51.364
what would've happened to him.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.834
He had no experience
with women.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.636
I had to teach
him everything.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.739
You know, Balki told me
about the time

03:58.772 --> 04:00.741
you took him
to that singles bar..

04:01.908 --> 04:02.843
He did?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.046
Uh, the way
Balki tells it

04:06.079 --> 04:09.315
you were both
babes in the woods.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.985
So Larry took Balki
to a singles bar to meet women..

04:13.787 --> 04:16.723
[instrumental music]

04:24.430 --> 04:26.567
So, this is one
of your American mating places?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.435
Meeting.
A meeting place.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.437
People meet
each other here.

04:31.471 --> 04:33.039
They mate
somewhere else.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.710
Go slow.
Take it easy.

04:36.743 --> 04:37.644
Be cool.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.881
I know how to be cool.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.990
Hey, mama, you be getting down
with you bad self.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.026
What are you doing?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.397
Alright, let's
get this over with

04:57.430 --> 04:58.464
so I can go home.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.637
Now, the first thing is
what we call eye contact.

05:03.670 --> 05:04.705
Eye contact.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.039
Like the three stooges?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.509
Ay‐na‐nay, pook.

05:11.077 --> 05:14.380
‐ Alright, I'm going, I'm out‐‐
‐ No, no, cousin, cousin.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.416
Okay. Okay.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.319
Look, for safety's sake, we had
better define eye contact.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.922
You look, look

05:21.955 --> 05:24.490
into a woman's eyes
from across the room

05:24.525 --> 05:26.927
and if she looks back, you know,
and you kind of hold the look

05:26.960 --> 05:28.729
that's eye contact.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.833
Like that woman
is looking at you?

05:34.535 --> 05:35.736
What woman?

05:39.105 --> 05:40.874
Don't point.

05:51.417 --> 05:54.420
After you've made,
uh, eye contact..

05:54.454 --> 05:55.922
...you work your way
over to the woman

05:55.956 --> 05:58.792
and, uh, use
your opening line.

05:58.825 --> 06:00.561
Something like, uh

06:00.594 --> 06:02.128
"You come here often?"

06:02.162 --> 06:03.897
"Can I buy you
a drink?"

06:03.930 --> 06:06.533
"Didn't we meet
in the Oval Office?"

06:06.567 --> 06:07.801
Things like that.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.938
‐ Can I try it?
‐ Oh...okay.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.555
I have made
eye contact.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.591
Oh, boy.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.859
‐ Can I try my opening line?
‐ Alright, go ahead.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.662
Just, uh, don't
tell her you know me.

06:42.936 --> 06:43.870
Hello.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.674
Do you
come here often?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.510
No.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.711
Would you smother me

06:50.744 --> 06:52.846
with your
beautiful American body?

06:55.716 --> 06:56.817
Excuse us.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.657
You were one step away
from throwing yourself

07:03.690 --> 07:05.425
at that woman's feet,
weren't you?

07:06.492 --> 07:08.695
Old habits die hard.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.898
Why don't you show me,
Cousin Larry?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.700
You're the expert.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.802
Look, look, I‐I just don't
like these places.

07:15.836 --> 07:16.803
And besides, I'm..

07:16.837 --> 07:19.673
...I'm more of a kind of, uh,
talking expert

07:19.706 --> 07:21.074
than a, uh..

07:21.107 --> 07:23.877
Uh...I really don't
wanna meet anyone.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.715
That woman is still
looking at you.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.683
She is?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.687
Yes, she is.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.792
Oh, my God,
she is.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.861
Go ahead and get her,
you love‐devil.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.031
Alright...but this
is a little faster

07:45.065 --> 07:47.634
than I usually
like to operate.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.235
I'm only doing this
for you.

08:06.086 --> 08:06.853
So..

08:06.887 --> 08:09.523
Hey, pal,
that's my girlfriend!

08:10.557 --> 08:11.725
Balki..

08:11.758 --> 08:12.926
'Balki.'

08:12.959 --> 08:13.894
Balki..

08:15.662 --> 08:18.799
[laughing]

08:18.832 --> 08:20.734
I wish, I wish
I could've seen that.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.703
I'm a sucker
for a cheap laugh.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.074
Uh, you know, I‐I don't mean
to split hairs here

08:28.108 --> 08:30.276
but, uh, that is

08:30.310 --> 08:32.813
not at all the way
I remember it.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.881
Well, did the guy
beat you up or not?

08:36.249 --> 08:37.784
Well..

08:37.818 --> 08:38.952
Uh..

08:38.985 --> 08:41.988
"Beat up"
is such a strong term.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.125
Sounds like he got
his butt kicked.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.893
[laughs]

08:48.862 --> 08:51.765
Look, there have been
countless times

08:51.798 --> 08:53.266
th‐that Balki has needed me

08:53.299 --> 08:55.969
and I have been
there for him.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.204
I mean, for instance, the time
he invited his friend Gina

08:58.238 --> 09:01.642
to‐to stay with us while
her husband was out of town‐‐

09:01.675 --> 09:03.209
Gina, i‐isn't she the one
who had her baby

09:03.243 --> 09:04.611
while she was
staying with you?

09:04.645 --> 09:07.614
Yes, in the middle
of the night.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.751
And if I had not been there
with one of my foolproof plans

09:10.784 --> 09:12.786
well, there is no telling
what would've happened.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.055
Oh, that's interesting.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.823
Uh, the way I heard it

09:16.857 --> 09:18.692
your plan
sort of fell apart!

09:18.725 --> 09:20.026
Well..

09:20.060 --> 09:21.928
Larry had rehearsed
everything

09:21.962 --> 09:23.564
using a stopwatch, so..

09:26.066 --> 09:28.268
Balki, it's time.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.937
‐ Gina? It's time?
‐ Yes.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.707
Ah, Gina, how exciting!

09:33.740 --> 09:36.009
‐ Little baby.
‐ Mm.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.744
Why is the light on?

09:37.778 --> 09:40.046
The‐the baby's
coming, Larry.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.748
What baby?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.784
Who are you?

09:43.817 --> 09:45.752
Why am I holding a sheep?

09:47.287 --> 09:49.690
He doesn't
wake up well.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.892
Cousin, it's Gina.
Remember the plan?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.296
The plan? Yes.
Of course, I remember the plan.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.298
It's my plan.
Alright.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.067
No need to worry.
First babies take a long time.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.670
Oh, well, Larry,
I've been in labor a long time.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.705
Why didn't you tell us?

10:04.738 --> 10:05.772
Well, I didn't wanna
bother you.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.774
You were up so late.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.843
Alright.
Don't panic!

10:11.277 --> 10:12.613
Go!

10:17.884 --> 10:19.786
‐ Are you alright?
‐ Yes. Yes, I'm okay.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.688
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Calling the hospital.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.323
Ca‐calling the hospital
is my job.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.759
‐ You get the suitcase!
‐ But..

10:25.792 --> 10:27.327
I‐I called the hospital
last time.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.428
Look, I gave you
a chance to prove

10:28.461 --> 10:30.196
you're a good communicator,
and what did you say?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.065
"Hello, hospital?
Baby is coming."

10:32.098 --> 10:34.200
Cavemen are
more articulate!

10:34.234 --> 10:35.669
Could you please hurry?

10:35.702 --> 10:36.937
Oh!

10:36.970 --> 10:38.905
Hello, hospital?
The baby is coming.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.976
Brilliant!

10:43.009 --> 10:44.778
‐ I forgot to tell who‐‐
‐ Oh, L‐Larry, there's no time.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.146
We get to the hospital

10:46.179 --> 10:47.280
they'll probably figure out
why I'm there.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.415
Good‐good thinking.
Okay. Alright.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.886
No need to panic.
Everything is under control.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.188
Alright, I get the note

10:55.221 --> 10:57.991
and we are gone..

10:58.024 --> 10:58.959
Yes!

11:04.064 --> 11:05.866
My keys. My keys.
Where are my keys?

11:05.899 --> 11:06.833
‐ They're in your pants.
‐ Where are my pants?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.802
‐ Where are my pants?
‐ They're in the closet.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.204
Where is the closet?
Where is the closet?

11:11.237 --> 11:12.773
‐ Cousin..
‐ Look, look.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.941
We can't get to the hospital
without my keys.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.409
‐ 'Cousin‐‐'
‐ Don't cousin me now.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.311
Look, look,
I don't have my keys.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.379
I don't have my pants.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.981
I can't do this!

11:21.014 --> 11:23.083
She'll just have to have
the baby at some other time!

11:23.116 --> 11:25.351
Why don't you help me?

11:25.385 --> 11:26.787
[panting]

11:29.222 --> 11:31.057
Oh. Oh, I see.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.894
You're trying to make me
look bad in front of Gina.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.962
Where is Gina?
Where is the mother?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.798

11:39.165 --> 11:40.734

11:40.767 --> 11:42.803
Someday you'll forgive me
for this.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.145
Feel better?

11:52.178 --> 11:53.914
No.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.518
Can we go have a baby now?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.152
Okay.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.887
I'll follow you.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.456
Where're you going?

12:03.489 --> 12:05.491
‐ To the hospital.
‐ Right, yes.

12:05.526 --> 12:07.994
Gina, there you are.
Thank God!

12:14.067 --> 12:16.069
[instrumental music]

12:24.545 --> 12:26.479
You know, I'm a little worried
about Balki.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.382
Shouldn't he be finished
with his exam by now?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.417
What if he sat down

12:31.451 --> 12:34.788
to take the test and froze up?

12:34.821 --> 12:37.190
I mean, what‐what‐what
if his mind went blank

12:37.223 --> 12:39.025
and he couldn't
remember a thing?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.394
What‐what‐what if
he got dizzy

12:41.427 --> 12:44.464
and, and the room
started spinning and..

12:44.497 --> 12:48.034
...and he started
hyperventilating..

12:48.068 --> 12:49.435
You mean, like what
happens to you

12:49.469 --> 12:51.404
when you sit down to write
your advice column?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.576
Alright.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.311
Alright. I'm just not
gonna talk anymore.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.080
That way no one
can make fun of me.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.555
Ladies, ladies,
we're‐we're all a little edgy

13:08.589 --> 13:11.892
because we're worried
about Balki.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.960
Oh, but maybe I should
have gone down there with him.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.529
He always needs me
to get through

13:15.562 --> 13:17.898
these pressure situations.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.065
You know, if I
wasn't there to help him

13:19.099 --> 13:21.134
he wouldn't have gotten through
his first day of work.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.336
Wait a minute.
I was there.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.371
And I wouldn't call
what you did help.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.008
Now Gorpley was looking
for a reason to fire Balki.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.543
And Larry was trying to write
his first article

13:29.576 --> 13:31.311
for the newspaper,
when all of a sudden..

13:33.213 --> 13:35.248
‐ You've finished?
‐ Yes, yes, yes.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.317
I'm finished.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.585
This is all of 'em?

13:38.619 --> 13:40.086
Yes. I'm sorry
it take so long.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.422
But I‐I thought that I would
alphabeticalize them.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.226
Is that okay?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.260
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?

Well, I'm no
Sam Donaldson, but..

13:51.565 --> 13:53.867
We'll see
how smart you are.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.602
I need 100 copies
of this flyer.

13:55.636 --> 13:57.437
You've got ten minutes.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.340
Oh, but guess what?
The copy machine is broke.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.308
Hey, relax,
I'm looking out for you.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.212
You can use
the mimeograph machine.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.381
See, I even got your stencil.
All ready to go.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.951
Ten minutes,
Bartokomous.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.252
Now, if you can't
do the job..

14:12.285 --> 14:14.320
...I know someone who can.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.428
Balki, you need help with
the mimeograph machine?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.430
‐ Oh, no, no, cousin.
‐ Good.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.667
Just...point
it out to me.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.935
Oh.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.070
Back here, look here.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.038
Just wheel it out to your table

14:32.072 --> 14:33.373
and I'll plug it in.

14:35.976 --> 14:36.910
Alright.

‐ Okay.

Okay, get the paper.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.360

‐ Okay. Stencil's on.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.164

‐ Oh, it's going fine!

Just, just dandy.

15:14.548 --> 15:16.617
You just finish
your article.

‐ No, no. No problem.

No problem, cousin.

15:24.725 --> 15:26.560
‐ Appleby?
‐ Uh, yes, sir.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.529
I need that article
in five minutes.

15:28.562 --> 15:31.331
Yes, sir.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.236
‐ Alright.
‐ Cousin, no!

15:36.269 --> 15:37.571
You have to do
your article.

do this in just a‐‐

five minutes and you just‐‐

a look at this here.

here's the problem.

You got all these papers
jammed under the drum, here.

And it's hungry!

‐ Oh!

16:35.361 --> 16:37.363
Appleman, where
is the story?

16:37.397 --> 16:38.732
Mr. Burns, something came up

16:38.765 --> 16:41.535
and I still have a bit of
polishing to do.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.070
This is‐this is news,
not silverware.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.205
I need a story!

16:45.238 --> 16:46.573
Mr. Burns, it was my fault.

16:46.607 --> 16:48.809
I accidentally threw
his article away.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.310
But I just found it.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.377
Well, actually,
that's not the final

16:51.411 --> 16:52.813

16:52.846 --> 16:54.615
‐ If I could just have a..
‐ It's pretty good.

16:54.648 --> 16:56.550
Well, Mr. Burns, if I could
only.. Pretty good?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.318
I'd say, for your first
assignment

16:58.351 --> 16:59.620
it's pretty good.

17:01.555 --> 17:04.525
See you on Monday,
Appleton.

17:04.558 --> 17:05.458
Then maybe
you can explain to me

17:05.491 --> 17:08.127
why you were trying
to mimeograph your tie!

17:09.796 --> 17:11.164
[laughing]

17:11.196 --> 17:12.699
Okay. Okay, alright.

17:12.733 --> 17:14.701
That particular time

17:14.734 --> 17:18.338
Balki was more help to me
than I was to him.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.205
But that was
an exception.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.642
I mean, more often than not

17:21.675 --> 17:23.209
he wouldn't know what to do

17:23.242 --> 17:25.612
unless I led him
by the hand.

17:25.646 --> 17:28.849
Come on, you guys
know that!

17:28.882 --> 17:31.417
I mean, why do I feel like
I'm defending myself?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.554
I think of all the times

17:33.587 --> 17:35.255
that if I wasn't there

17:35.288 --> 17:38.358
he wouldn't know
what to do.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.199

of something.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.434

to insults.

‐ I've got one.
‐ Yeah, there. You see?

18:06.152 --> 18:09.523
I remember the time you
taught Balki all about plumbing?

18:09.556 --> 18:11.491
'You see, Jennifer and I
were out of town'

18:11.525 --> 18:13.560
and Larry offered
to fix our shower.

18:13.594 --> 18:15.328

there while we were..

we've been here.

must be amazing stuff.

we button this job up?
