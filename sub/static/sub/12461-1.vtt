00:24.378 --> 00:28.166
An evil old house,
the kind some people call haunted...

00:29.098 --> 00:32.249
is like an undiscovered country
waiting to be explored.

00:33.298 --> 00:37.052
Hill House had stood for 90 years
and might stand for 90 more.

00:38.178 --> 00:41.966
Silence lay steadily against the wood
and stone of Hill House.

00:42.698 --> 00:45.770
Whatever walked there walked alone.

02:17.498 --> 02:20.490
Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide.

02:20.978 --> 02:23.412
The history of Hill House was ideal.

02:23.498 --> 02:25.489
It had everything l wanted.

02:26.458 --> 02:29.177
It was built 90-odd, very odd years ago...

02:29.258 --> 02:32.648
by a man named Hugh Crain
as a home for his wife and daughter...

02:32.738 --> 02:35.571
in the most remote part of New England
he could find.

02:40.138 --> 02:42.174
It was an evil house from the beginning.

02:42.258 --> 02:44.169
A house that was born bad.

02:51.498 --> 02:52.817
Hugh Crain's young wife...

02:52.898 --> 02:55.970
died seconds before
she was to set eyes on the house.

02:57.178 --> 03:00.011
She was killed when,
for no apparent reason...

03:00.098 --> 03:03.693
the horses bolted,
crashing her carriage against a big tree.

03:09.738 --> 03:11.456
Mrs. Crain was carried...

03:12.498 --> 03:14.773
Iifeless is the word, l think...

03:14.858 --> 03:17.611
into the home
her husband had built for her.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.492
Hugh Crain was left an embittered man...

03:22.218 --> 03:25.016
with a small daughter, Abigail, to bring up.

03:42.858 --> 03:45.247
Fortunately, for me, that is...

03:45.778 --> 03:48.895
Hugh Crain did not leave Hill House.
He married again.

03:57.338 --> 04:00.410
The second Mrs. Crain's death
was even more interesting...

04:00.498 --> 04:02.295
than her predecessor's.

04:15.458 --> 04:18.575
I've been unable to find out
how or why she fell...

04:19.178 --> 04:21.214
although l have my suspicions.

04:27.738 --> 04:30.810
Hugh Crain left Abigail with a nurse
and went to England...

04:30.898 --> 04:33.287
where he died in a drowning accident.

04:33.378 --> 04:34.572
Marvelous!

04:34.658 --> 04:38.617
I mean, the way the history of Hill House
follows a classic pattern.

04:41.858 --> 04:42.893
For some reason...

04:42.978 --> 04:46.607
Abigail kept that same nursery room
in Hill House where she grew up...

04:47.458 --> 04:48.891
and grew old.

05:03.378 --> 05:06.336
In later years,
she became a bedridden invalid.

05:06.738 --> 05:10.492
She took a girl from the village
to live with her as a paid companion.

05:14.058 --> 05:15.776
It's with this young companion...

05:15.858 --> 05:18.736
the evil reputation of Hill House
really begins.

05:24.818 --> 05:27.730
The story goes
that the old lady died calling for help...

05:27.818 --> 05:29.774
in the nursery upstairs...

05:30.018 --> 05:33.647
while the companion fooled around
with a farm hand on the verandah.

05:44.258 --> 05:48.171
The companion inherited Hill House
and occupied it for many years.

05:48.298 --> 05:51.096
The local people believe that,
one way or another...

05:51.178 --> 05:53.408
she had murdered her benefactor.

05:53.938 --> 05:57.135
She lived a life of complete solitude
in the empty house...

05:57.218 --> 06:00.130
though some say
that the house was not empty...

06:00.218 --> 06:03.528
and never has been
since the night old Miss Abby died.

06:04.778 --> 06:08.930
They say that whatever there was
and still is in the house...

06:09.738 --> 06:12.093
eventually drove the companion mad.

06:15.938 --> 06:17.929
We do know she hanged herself.

06:18.498 --> 06:19.533
After her death...

06:19.618 --> 06:23.372
the house passed legally into the hands
of a distant relative in Boston...

06:23.458 --> 06:27.849
an old lady, Mrs. Sannerson,
who l very much wanted to see.

06:28.938 --> 06:32.214
All my life l've been looking
for an honestly haunted house.

06:32.298 --> 06:36.052
In the interests of psychic research,
you must let me have it for a few weeks.

06:36.138 --> 06:40.290
No one who rented Hill House
ever stayed for more than a few days.

06:41.338 --> 06:44.569
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.

06:44.898 --> 06:46.377
I don't believe it.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.608
Dr. Markway is a trained anthropologist...

06:48.698 --> 06:50.893
a respected member
of a university faculty.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.446
We should welcome such a man
to investigate Hill House.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.573
Perhaps.

06:54.658 --> 06:57.456
As an old woman due shortly
to enter the next world...

06:57.538 --> 06:59.051
I'd like to know if there is one.

06:59.138 --> 07:02.926
I'm sure his report will give Hill House
a clean bill of health.

07:03.338 --> 07:07.092
How will you go about conducting
your investigations, Dr. Markway?

07:07.858 --> 07:11.214
I shall occupy the house with a group
of carefully selected assistants--

07:11.298 --> 07:13.766
-Assistants?
-My dear Mrs. Sannerson...

07:14.138 --> 07:17.016
I am a scientist conducting
an unusual experiment.

07:17.098 --> 07:19.566
A haunted house. Everyone laughs.

07:19.658 --> 07:21.808
So l must have specially qualified help...

07:21.898 --> 07:25.174
to take notes and document any evidence
of the supernatural l may find.

07:25.258 --> 07:28.250
-Who are these assistants?
-I haven't made my final choice yet...

07:28.338 --> 07:31.455
but they're from a list of names
l've been assembling over the years.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.257
-We don't want any publicity seekers.
-Of course not.

07:34.338 --> 07:37.489
These people have only been selected
after painstaking research.

07:37.578 --> 07:41.287
They've all been involved before,
one way or another, with the abnormal.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.209
I don't like the sound of that.

07:43.298 --> 07:46.574
-Are any of the people women?
-Some.

07:46.658 --> 07:48.728
-Are you a married man?
-Yes.

07:49.018 --> 07:51.532
Then your wife will be accompanying you.

07:51.658 --> 07:53.137
I'm afraid not.

07:53.218 --> 07:56.449
My wife disapproves of my experiments
with the supernatural.

07:56.538 --> 07:58.494
She wants no part of Hill House.

07:58.578 --> 08:01.297
To make sure
that everything is as it should be...

08:01.378 --> 08:04.097
suppose your nephew
goes along with Dr. Markway?

08:04.178 --> 08:05.133
Luke?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.332
Our young Lochinvar
from out of the Midwest.

08:09.378 --> 08:12.290
I haven't much confidence
in that branch of the family.

08:12.378 --> 08:15.848
In this case, l think you can.
Luke expects to inherit Hill House...

08:15.938 --> 08:18.736
and he'll make sure
that his property is well taken care of.

08:18.818 --> 08:20.012
His property?

08:21.538 --> 08:24.371
Still, it might be rather good at that.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.930
Luke hopes one day to live off Hill House.

08:28.018 --> 08:31.055
But he never dreamed
to find himself living in it.

08:31.858 --> 08:34.496
Harper, give Dr. Markway his lease.

08:34.578 --> 08:36.057
Thank you, Mrs. Sannerson.

08:36.138 --> 08:39.049
A word of warning:
Don't play gin with Luke.

08:39.138 --> 08:40.287
He's a cardsharp.

08:40.378 --> 08:43.211
Good. That indicates a strong instinct
for self-preservation.

08:43.298 --> 08:47.371
Exactly what do you and your assistants
expect to find at Hill House?

08:48.658 --> 08:51.855
Maybe only a few loose floorboards,
and maybe...

08:52.418 --> 08:54.090
I only say maybe...

08:54.738 --> 08:56.649
the key to another world.

09:15.778 --> 09:18.008
You've just got to let me have the car.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.018
There's no other way of getting there,
and l'm expected.

09:21.098 --> 09:23.612
-Calm down.
-I've even bought some new clothes.

09:23.698 --> 09:25.051
Please, Bud.

09:25.458 --> 09:29.212
Carrie drives the car all the time
and l never even take it out of the garage.

09:29.298 --> 09:31.448
-Mother....
-Mother what?

09:33.538 --> 09:34.857
Nothing.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.255
Auntie Nell is blinking.

09:43.778 --> 09:45.131
Quiet, Dora.

09:45.458 --> 09:48.609
Let's talk this over without anybody
getting emotional or nervous.

09:48.698 --> 09:50.654
Why shouldn't l be nervous?

09:50.738 --> 09:54.174
My first chance for a vacation in my life
and you won't let me take it.

09:54.258 --> 09:57.056
There's a good reason Mother was afraid
for you to go anywhere...

09:57.138 --> 09:58.287
and it still applies.

09:58.378 --> 10:01.768
We're not going to dig up
the family skeleton again, are we?

10:02.058 --> 10:04.333
I think you should have a vacation, Nell.

10:04.418 --> 10:07.854
Nobody knows better than me what you
went through during your mother's illness.

10:07.938 --> 10:10.736
Dirty laundry,
the smell of that sickroom....

10:11.058 --> 10:13.049
Talk about mean old ladies!

10:13.938 --> 10:15.894
Let the dead rest in peace.

10:15.978 --> 10:18.936
It's half my car.
I helped pay for it and l mean to take it.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.736
We don't know where you're going.

10:20.818 --> 10:23.537
You haven't seen fit
to tell us anything, have you?

10:23.618 --> 10:25.290
No, you may not have the car.

10:25.378 --> 10:28.017
What beats me is why
you're playing this thing so cozy...

10:28.098 --> 10:29.372
Iike this was a jailbreak.

10:29.458 --> 10:33.371
In any case, l'm sure l'm doing
what Mother would have thought best.

10:33.538 --> 10:37.292
Although l don't suppose
poor Mother's wishes mean much to you.

10:38.018 --> 10:40.452
Get out. Get out, both of you.

10:41.298 --> 10:44.654
Now just a minute, young lady.
You happen to be in my living room.

10:44.738 --> 10:48.413
I happen to be in my bedroom,
and l pay a good part of your rent for it.

10:48.498 --> 10:51.854
Now get out before l show you
what my nerves can really do!

10:55.018 --> 10:58.408
Besides, how do l know you'll
bring back my car in good condition?

10:58.498 --> 10:59.692
Come on.

11:20.018 --> 11:23.374
I want my car. I mean to take it.

11:23.538 --> 11:25.529
-Which?
-The Fredericks' car.

11:29.818 --> 11:32.286
-You ain't Mrs. Fredericks.
-It's half mine.

11:32.378 --> 11:34.573
-Who are you?
-Her sister, Miss Lance.

11:34.658 --> 11:38.128
Look, here's my driver's license...

11:39.218 --> 11:40.936
here's my library card...

11:41.618 --> 11:43.654
and here's a blood donor card.

11:45.058 --> 11:48.289
All the same address as my sister's.
I live with her.

11:48.698 --> 11:51.656
-Front row, left of the far pillar.
-Thank you.

12:08.658 --> 12:11.013
"Very happy that you'll be joining us
in Hill House.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.214
"Take US 50 from Boston...

12:13.298 --> 12:16.096
"and watch for the turnoff
onto Route 238."

12:19.378 --> 12:20.652
Route 238.

12:21.698 --> 12:24.166
At last l am going someplace
where l'm expected...

12:24.258 --> 12:26.374
and where l'm being given shelter.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.847
And l shall never have to come back.

12:29.058 --> 12:31.367
I hope....

12:31.458 --> 12:34.211
This is what l've been waiting for
all my life.

12:36.698 --> 12:39.258
I'm going. I'm really going.

12:39.778 --> 12:41.734
I've finally taken a step.

12:50.538 --> 12:52.768
By now they know the car is gone...

12:53.618 --> 12:55.415
but they don't know where.

12:56.098 --> 12:58.771
They would never have suspected it of me.

12:59.298 --> 13:02.017
I would never have suspected it of myself.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.050
I'm a new person.

13:19.258 --> 13:21.897
Someday....

13:21.978 --> 13:24.651
Someday l'll have an apartment
of my own...

13:25.698 --> 13:29.816
in a house with a pair ofstone lions
guarding the gate.

13:31.658 --> 13:34.730
I might just stop anywhere
and never leave again.

13:35.818 --> 13:37.376
Or l might drive on and on...

13:37.458 --> 13:40.177
until the wheels of the car
are worn to nothing...

13:40.738 --> 13:43.206
and l've come to the end of the world.

13:44.058 --> 13:46.936
I wonder if all homeless people
feel that way.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.767
I wonder what Dr. Markway is like.

13:51.778 --> 13:54.008
I wonder who else will be there.

13:55.058 --> 13:57.333
I wonder what Hill House is like.

14:27.378 --> 14:30.256
-What do you want?
-I want to come in, please.

14:31.178 --> 14:33.214
-Please unlock the gates.
-Who says?

14:34.578 --> 14:36.887
I'm supposed to come in. I'm expected.

14:36.978 --> 14:39.014
-Who by?
-Dr. Markway.

14:40.058 --> 14:42.014
-You better come back later.
-Please.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.736
I'm one of Dr. Markway's guests.

14:43.818 --> 14:46.651
He's expecting me in the house.
Please listen to me.

14:46.738 --> 14:48.535
He can't rightly be expecting you...

14:48.618 --> 14:51.371
seeing as you're
the only one who's come so far.

14:52.178 --> 14:54.738
Do you mean that
there's no one in the house?

14:54.818 --> 14:56.490
No one you'd want to see.

14:58.538 --> 15:01.496
-What did you say your name was?
-Eleanor Lance...

15:01.578 --> 15:03.569
and l am expected in Hill House.

15:03.658 --> 15:06.252
-Unlock those gates at once.
-All right.

15:10.058 --> 15:12.652
Suppose you know what you're asking for
coming here.

15:12.738 --> 15:15.298
Suppose they told you, back in the city.

15:32.898 --> 15:35.366
You seem to be the one who's afraid.

15:36.218 --> 15:38.573
You'll be sorry l ever opened the gate.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.457
Out of the way, please.
You've held me up long enough.

15:41.538 --> 15:44.336
-Are you Dudley, the caretaker?
-I'm Dudley, the caretaker.

15:44.418 --> 15:45.931
I shall report you.

15:46.018 --> 15:48.088
Think they can find anyone else
to stay here?

15:48.178 --> 15:51.056
Think we can't have things
the way we want, me and the wife...

15:51.138 --> 15:53.288
as long as we stay around here,
see to the house...

15:53.378 --> 15:56.336
for all you city people
think you know everything?

16:34.618 --> 16:36.176
It's staring at me.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.367
Vile.

16:41.498 --> 16:44.331
Get away from here. Get away at once.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.767
It's my chance.
I'm being given a last chance.

16:49.058 --> 16:51.288
I could turn my car around
and go away from here...

16:51.378 --> 16:54.734
and no one would blame me.
Anyone has a right to run away.

16:55.818 --> 16:58.207
But you are running away, Eleanor...

16:58.738 --> 17:00.808
and there's nowhere else to go.

17:41.738 --> 17:43.217
It's waiting for me.

17:44.018 --> 17:46.486
Evil, patient...

17:46.898 --> 17:48.126
waiting.

18:09.898 --> 18:11.047
Mrs. Dudley?

18:12.018 --> 18:14.737
I'm Eleanor Lance. I'm expected.

18:44.018 --> 18:46.009
Can you take me to my room?

18:59.778 --> 19:02.576
I gather l'm the first one here,
Mrs. Dudley.

19:03.018 --> 19:06.328
You did say you were Mrs. Dudley?
l met your....

19:13.858 --> 19:16.577
Talk about being scared
of your own shadow.

19:17.058 --> 19:18.889
Pull yourself together.

19:21.978 --> 19:23.047
Here.

19:31.058 --> 19:32.571
This is your room.

19:34.218 --> 19:35.412
How nice.

19:36.338 --> 19:38.135
I can't keep the rooms the way l'd like...

19:38.218 --> 19:41.335
but there's no one else they could get
that would help me.

19:42.298 --> 19:43.731
How very nice.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.936
I set dinner
on the dining room sideboard at 6:00.

19:47.018 --> 19:48.656
I clear up in the morning.

19:48.738 --> 19:52.128
I have breakfast for you at 9:00.
I don't wait on people.

19:52.338 --> 19:54.932
I don't stay after l set out the dinner.

19:55.058 --> 19:57.288
Not after it begins to get dark.

19:57.778 --> 19:59.734
I leave before the dark comes.

20:00.338 --> 20:03.216
-Your husband?
-We live over in town, miles away.

20:03.458 --> 20:05.608
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

20:05.698 --> 20:06.767
I understand.

20:06.858 --> 20:09.292
We couldn't hear you...in the night.

20:10.098 --> 20:12.692
-Do you have any idea when--
-No one could.

20:13.058 --> 20:15.094
No one lives any nearer than town.

20:15.858 --> 20:18.247
No one will come any nearer than that...

20:18.338 --> 20:19.487
I know.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.930
...in the night, in the dark.

20:48.818 --> 20:52.208
I'm like a small creature
swallowed whole by a monster...

20:52.658 --> 20:55.616
and the monster
feels my tiny movements inside.

21:00.578 --> 21:03.046
Now, Eleanor Lance, you just stop it.

21:40.378 --> 21:42.494
Thank heavens somebody's here.

21:42.778 --> 21:45.736
My name's Eleanor Lance.
I'm so glad you're here.

21:45.818 --> 21:47.854
I'm Theodora. Just Theodora.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.611
What about this crazy house?

21:49.698 --> 21:51.928
I'm right next door.
We have a connecting bath.

21:52.018 --> 21:53.770
This used to be
the embalming room, l bet.

21:53.858 --> 21:55.177
It was terrible being here alone.

21:55.258 --> 21:57.010
I set dinner on the sideboard at 6:00--

21:57.098 --> 21:59.214
Where's Markway?
l thought he'd be here first.

21:59.298 --> 22:01.050
Serve yourselves.
I clear up in the morning.

22:01.138 --> 22:03.606
-Have you known Dr. Markway long?
-Breakfast is at 9:00.

22:03.698 --> 22:06.610
-I've never met him.
-I don't stay after 6:00, when it gets dark.

22:06.698 --> 22:11.089
Our only contact is our correspondence
about the "experiment."

22:11.178 --> 22:12.531
I leave before the dark comes.

22:12.618 --> 22:15.655
So there won't be anyone around
if you need help.

22:16.578 --> 22:18.773
No one can hear you
if you scream in the night.

22:18.858 --> 22:20.610
Isn't that so, Mrs. Dudley?

22:20.898 --> 22:23.207
No one lives any nearer than town.

22:23.778 --> 22:26.372
No one will come any nearer than that...

22:26.458 --> 22:28.813
in the night...in the dark.

22:35.098 --> 22:37.328
-You're frightened, Nell.
-No more.

22:37.778 --> 22:40.292
Just when l thought l was all alone.

22:40.738 --> 22:42.774
But how did you know
my nickname is Nell?

22:42.858 --> 22:45.611
That is the affectionate term
for Eleanor, isn't it?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.734
Yes, l suppose it is.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.569
What a nice way of putting it.

22:50.658 --> 22:53.172
The affectionate term
for Theodora is Theo.

22:54.978 --> 22:57.253
We're going to be great friends, Theo.

22:57.338 --> 22:58.737
Like sisters?

23:00.018 --> 23:02.009
There's no need
to hang around our rooms.

23:02.098 --> 23:03.850
-Let's go exploring.
-I'd like to.

23:03.938 --> 23:07.647
Why don't you put on one of your
new things? Something that'll stand out.

23:07.738 --> 23:11.367
I think it's a good idea around here
to always remain strictly visible.

23:11.578 --> 23:13.296
Be ready in a jiffy.

23:14.098 --> 23:16.168
How did you know l brought new clothes?

23:16.258 --> 23:18.726
You wear your thoughts on your sleeve.

23:18.818 --> 23:20.968
Anyway, that's better than my heart.

23:33.338 --> 23:36.648
How did l get into this? Why am l here?

23:37.578 --> 23:39.534
What nightmares are waiting?

23:39.618 --> 23:43.372
Damn it! l still say one of these doors
should lead to the main hall.

23:43.458 --> 23:45.414
Any lights near you, Nell?

23:49.098 --> 23:51.134
It helps if you make a game of it.

23:51.218 --> 23:53.209
Pretend this is hide-and-seek.

23:53.298 --> 23:54.856
But we're still lost.

23:55.418 --> 23:56.407
Yes.

23:57.298 --> 24:00.256
That passageway.
We haven't tried that one yet.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.050
What's the matter?

24:04.178 --> 24:06.089
There's something with us.

24:07.858 --> 24:09.610
I don't see anything.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.529
-Can't you feel it?
-No.

24:13.138 --> 24:14.571
I feel a chill.

24:15.098 --> 24:18.249
-It's moving.
-It's just the air rushing past our ears.

24:20.178 --> 24:21.293
Then who?

24:23.378 --> 24:24.333
What?

24:25.258 --> 24:28.250
The house, it's alive.

24:36.618 --> 24:38.336
She didn't hear that.

24:39.418 --> 24:41.249
Nobody heard it but me.

24:44.978 --> 24:46.650
It wants you, Nell.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.575
The house is calling you.

24:56.738 --> 25:01.050
I've waited such a long time.
Is this what l came so far to find?

25:05.298 --> 25:08.335
Don't let me go! Theo, stay with me!

25:10.538 --> 25:13.655
You won't believe this,
but five minutes ago l left this door open...

25:13.738 --> 25:16.696
so you could find your way.
It closed by itself.

25:17.378 --> 25:19.812
Welcome to Hill House. I'm Dr. Markway.

25:19.898 --> 25:23.686
Thank goodness.
I thought you might be a ghost.

25:24.218 --> 25:27.051
-How do you know l'm not?
-Don't be ghoulish.

25:27.498 --> 25:29.773
You mustn't confuse ghoulish and ghostly.

25:29.858 --> 25:32.611
The word "ghoulish" is used to describe
a feeling of horror...

25:32.698 --> 25:34.495
often accompanied by intense cold.

25:34.578 --> 25:36.853
It has nothing to do with ghosts.
Ghosts are visible.

25:36.938 --> 25:40.453
-Enough of that. Get us out of here fast.
-What's the matter?

25:41.498 --> 25:43.568
Let's just say we're scared of the dark.

25:43.658 --> 25:46.172
I, too, go in mortal terror of the dark.

25:47.738 --> 25:50.127
-I'm Theodora.
-You must be Eleanor.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.777
I'm unsure at the moment.

25:51.858 --> 25:53.928
If it turns out you're not,
l'll be disappointed.

25:54.018 --> 25:55.167
All right.

25:55.258 --> 25:59.217
It's Theo who's wearing velvet,
so l must be Eleanor in tweed.

25:59.378 --> 26:00.254
Good.

26:00.338 --> 26:03.216
Follow me through
the uncharted waste of Hill House.

26:03.298 --> 26:04.856
Dinner's waiting.

26:09.498 --> 26:12.137
-Do you like it?
-Lovely. What do you call this?

26:12.218 --> 26:13.776
The Purple Parlor.

26:13.978 --> 26:16.856
We're going to use this
as the operating room.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.009
I mean the center of operations.

26:20.098 --> 26:22.407
-It's not very cheerful.
-I don't know.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.807
There's nothing more cozy
than an old gargoyle...

26:24.898 --> 26:26.809
except maybe a whipping post or two.

26:26.898 --> 26:29.571
This house does have its little oddities.

26:29.858 --> 26:32.053
The man who built it was a misfit...

26:32.138 --> 26:35.016
who hated people
and their conventional ideas.

26:35.098 --> 26:37.487
He built his house to suit his mind.

26:37.698 --> 26:41.532
For instance, all the doors
are hung slightly off-center.

26:41.938 --> 26:44.691
Probably explains why
they keep swinging shut by themselves.

26:44.778 --> 26:45.927
Watch.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.571
Now watch this.

26:54.258 --> 26:55.850
What did l tell you?

26:57.298 --> 27:01.086
Anyway, all the angles are slightly off.
There isn't a square corner in the place.

27:01.178 --> 27:03.976
No wonder it's impossible
to find your way around.

27:04.058 --> 27:06.526
Add up all these wrong angles...

27:06.618 --> 27:09.451
and you get one big distortion
in the house as a whole.

27:09.538 --> 27:11.847
Clever, Eleanor. You catch on fast.

27:12.618 --> 27:13.892
I'm hungry.

27:14.618 --> 27:15.687
Let's go.

27:15.978 --> 27:18.367
Sorry. In the psychic world
we're apt to forget...

27:18.458 --> 27:22.087
that food is still the main concern
of poor old homo sapiens.

27:22.538 --> 27:24.688
You see? Closed by itself.

27:26.818 --> 27:28.968
To the right, ladies.

27:36.298 --> 27:37.936
Now, which door?

27:40.178 --> 27:41.577
-That one.
-Wrong.

27:41.658 --> 27:43.694
I've studied a map, it's this one.

27:46.258 --> 27:49.568
-This proves it, one of you is a witch.
-A broom closet.

27:49.658 --> 27:52.252
If you can't find your way around,
how will we ever?

27:52.338 --> 27:55.853
All these doors, it makes me think
of the lady and the tiger.

27:55.938 --> 27:58.577
Let's see if there's a tiger behind this one.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.567
That's funny.

28:08.058 --> 28:09.650
-No tiger?
-Listen.

28:18.978 --> 28:21.208
What's wrong? Too much vermouth?

28:21.498 --> 28:22.977
Nothing that serious...

28:23.058 --> 28:26.971
and, please,
no cracks about my passion for spirits.

28:28.218 --> 28:30.812
If you two
are the ghostly inhabitants of Hill House...

28:30.898 --> 28:32.809
I must confess l'm glad l came.

28:34.098 --> 28:36.009
It has taken 60 million years...

28:36.098 --> 28:38.896
to develop the carnivorous biped
you see before you.

28:39.058 --> 28:40.047
Luke Sannerson.

28:40.138 --> 28:42.208
Let's see what kind of martinis it makes.

28:42.298 --> 28:45.449
They should be pretty good.
I majored in them at college.

28:45.538 --> 28:48.735
Are we to expect
any more carnivorous bipeds?

28:49.138 --> 28:52.255
Originally, there were six committed
to the experiment...

28:52.338 --> 28:54.090
but one by one the others dropped out.

28:54.178 --> 28:58.330
I suppose they were frightened by the
various unsavory stories about the house.

28:59.698 --> 29:01.654
You're the only ones left.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.367
What stories?

29:03.458 --> 29:05.847
You didn't investigate
before you came here?

29:07.698 --> 29:09.051
So much the better.

29:09.138 --> 29:11.606
You should be innocent and receptive.

29:13.498 --> 29:16.251
-So let's drink to our success.
-Success?

29:16.778 --> 29:20.054
And just how do you reckon success
in a junket like this?

29:20.138 --> 29:21.810
I'd like to drink...

29:22.658 --> 29:24.933
to just us, good companions.

29:25.258 --> 29:26.452
Excellent.

29:27.618 --> 29:29.131
To my new companion.

29:31.258 --> 29:33.010
Except l don't drink.

29:39.924 --> 29:42.438
-I think l'll have some more salmon.
-Palissy.

29:42.924 --> 29:44.755
-Yeah? How much is it worth?
-Plenty.

29:44.844 --> 29:47.483
Haven't seen Palissy outside of a museum.

29:47.724 --> 29:50.761
I'll take a pair of Kastle skis for them
any day of the week.

29:50.844 --> 29:53.438
I wonder how much l'll get
for this New England fossil.

29:53.524 --> 29:57.722
Don't let Mrs. Dudley hear you saying that.
At the moment she's giving us the best.

29:57.804 --> 30:01.797
I'm a simple fellow myself,
easily satisfied by the best of everything.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.239
Including, l hope,
some startling events to come.

30:04.324 --> 30:07.043
Exactly what do you
expect to happen, Dr. Markway?

30:07.404 --> 30:09.634
Yes, what is the matter with Hill House?

30:09.804 --> 30:12.193
What's going to happen?
Why are we here?

30:13.924 --> 30:18.202
Like so many people through the ages,
l've been intrigued by the supernatural...

30:18.284 --> 30:21.003
or rather
the possibility of the supernatural.

30:21.484 --> 30:23.873
I'm here in hopes of proving its existence.

30:23.964 --> 30:27.240
You're here to keep track and take notes
for an authenticated record.

30:27.324 --> 30:29.633
-Okay. But why us?
-It's no accident.

30:30.044 --> 30:33.593
You're what's left of a select company
chosen with great care.

30:33.684 --> 30:35.800
I combed the records
of psychic societies...

30:35.884 --> 30:39.240
the back numbers of newspapers,
reports of parapsychologists...

30:39.324 --> 30:43.203
hoping to find people who've been touched
in some way by the supernatural.

30:43.444 --> 30:47.119
It's my belief that the very presence
of people like yourselves in this house...

30:47.204 --> 30:50.276
will help to stimulate
the strange forces at work here.

30:50.364 --> 30:52.673
Charming thought, to be used as live bait.

30:52.764 --> 30:55.722
I'm here because
l'm a wolf in ghost's clothing.

30:55.964 --> 30:58.922
I'm not really running
a psychic beauty contest.

30:59.484 --> 31:00.803
You're here, Theo...

31:00.884 --> 31:03.956
because of your remarkable powers
of extrasensory perception.

31:04.044 --> 31:06.683
ESP? Don't believe in it.

31:07.084 --> 31:08.437
Theo's a champ.

31:08.524 --> 31:11.960
Her name shines in the annals
of Duke University Psychic Lab...

31:12.044 --> 31:14.399
where she identified 19 out of 20 cards...

31:14.484 --> 31:16.759
held up out of sight and hearing.

31:18.004 --> 31:21.155
But l've never had
anything to do with the supernatural.

31:21.244 --> 31:24.395
Yes, you have, Eleanor.
Your poltergeist experience.

31:24.684 --> 31:26.436
What's a poltergeist?

31:26.924 --> 31:30.314
-A playful ghost, isn't that right, Nell?
-I wouldn't know.

31:30.564 --> 31:33.442
According to the records
of the lnternational Psychic Society...

31:33.524 --> 31:37.312
showers of stones fell on your house for
three days when you were 10 years old.

31:37.404 --> 31:38.962
That's ridiculous.

31:39.084 --> 31:40.995
It was witnessed by your family...

31:41.084 --> 31:43.234
the neighbors, sightseers and the police.

31:43.324 --> 31:46.361
In fact, it's the only case
ever officially recorded by the police.

31:46.444 --> 31:48.036
It never happened.

31:48.804 --> 31:50.476
Perhaps not, if you say so.

31:50.564 --> 31:54.113
I only mention it because that's
the reason l wanted you in Hill House.

31:54.204 --> 31:55.432
Doc, level with us.

31:55.524 --> 31:58.197
I mean, you're a college prof.
A man with a PhD.

31:58.404 --> 32:01.601
You can't really believe
there's such a thing as a haunted house.

32:01.684 --> 32:05.120
I wish you'd stop referring
to this desirable property as haunted.

32:05.204 --> 32:06.922
There's that word "haunted" again.

32:07.004 --> 32:10.360
Makes me expect to find
a disembodied hand in the sauce.

32:10.444 --> 32:13.481
Nobody knows even
why some houses are called haunted.

32:13.804 --> 32:16.272
What would you call this place?
Fun-o-rama?

32:17.124 --> 32:19.957
Diseased, sick, crazy if you like.

32:21.164 --> 32:24.122
A deranged house
isn't a bad way of putting it.

32:24.644 --> 32:27.795
Your aunt thinks
that maybe Hill House was born bad.

32:28.244 --> 32:31.316
Such houses are described in the Bible
as leprous.

32:31.404 --> 32:33.793
Or before that,
in Homer's phrase for the underworld:

32:33.884 --> 32:35.397
a house of Hades.

32:35.924 --> 32:37.277
Come off it, Doc.

32:37.364 --> 32:40.037
Really, the local mayor
makes more sense to me.

32:40.364 --> 32:43.083
He says the disturbances
are caused by subterranean waters...

32:43.164 --> 32:47.237
electric currents, atmospheric pressure,
sunspots, earth tremors, et cetera.

32:47.324 --> 32:49.963
Sure, people always want to put
an easy label on things...

32:50.044 --> 32:51.397
even if it's meaningless.

32:51.484 --> 32:53.634
"The trouble with Hill House is sunspots."

32:53.724 --> 32:56.318
There's an explanation
you don't have to think twice about.

32:56.404 --> 32:58.964
And it has a scientific ring.

32:59.044 --> 33:01.274
That was the neighbors.
They threw the rocks.

33:01.364 --> 33:04.515
Mother says they were against us
because she wouldn't mix with them.

33:04.604 --> 33:05.957
Mother says....

33:09.564 --> 33:10.519
Oh, dear.

33:12.244 --> 33:14.200
That's all right, Eleanor.

33:14.404 --> 33:16.838
-Go on. What does your mother say?
-Nothing.

33:18.444 --> 33:20.833
I must be more tired than l thought.

33:21.324 --> 33:23.474
My mother died two months ago.

33:23.804 --> 33:26.113
You weren't sorry when it happened...

33:27.084 --> 33:28.039
were you?

33:28.964 --> 33:30.920
No, she wasn't very happy.

33:32.204 --> 33:34.195
Then l won't say l'm sorry now.

33:34.844 --> 33:37.153
If l'd known,
l'd never have asked you to come here.

33:37.244 --> 33:39.599
But l'm grateful you did. I had to get away.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.960
-Perhaps you should--
-Please, let's talk about something else.

33:43.244 --> 33:44.438
Oh, dear.

33:47.564 --> 33:49.714
Doc, see that? Now what about that?

33:49.804 --> 33:52.272
Does salt work against the supernatural?

33:52.364 --> 33:55.993
The Montusi bushmen thought so,
but they're extinct.

33:56.644 --> 33:59.477
You see, you haven't a ghost of a chance.

34:08.844 --> 34:10.914
I have a place in this room.

34:11.324 --> 34:13.360
These people are my friends.

34:13.804 --> 34:16.955
I'm one of them. I belong.

34:20.204 --> 34:21.319
Gin!

34:21.404 --> 34:24.760
-That's the fifth time, five times in a row.
-$12, please.

34:24.844 --> 34:26.960
-I hope your skirt isn't stained.
-That's all right.

34:27.043 --> 34:28.762
But the upholstery on the couch.

34:28.844 --> 34:29.719
I've cleanser upstairs.

34:29.804 --> 34:31.954
-Do you think l'm a sucker?
-Pay up. Cash on the line.

34:32.043 --> 34:34.683
Over my dead body.
You knew every card l had in my hand.

34:34.764 --> 34:37.880
-There's a name for that.
-If you mean cheating, l don't have to.

34:37.964 --> 34:40.080
Okay, Miss ESP,
go dream yourself up the $12.

34:40.164 --> 34:43.076
Pay up, you welsher!
l won fair and l want my money.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.759
-What was it?
-I had a feeling.

34:50.404 --> 34:54.443
-I'm sure it was just my imagination.
-A feeling you were being watched?

34:54.804 --> 34:56.032
Yes, l did.

34:56.123 --> 34:58.433
The house.
It watches every move we make.

34:58.524 --> 35:01.994
-That's your imagination.
-Don't be so cocksure of everything.

35:02.084 --> 35:05.633
A closed mind is the worst defense
against the supernatural.

35:05.964 --> 35:10.003
You think you're too civilized to need
to protect yourself against evil spirits.

35:10.084 --> 35:14.123
But even prehistoric man had a dozen
practical methods of warding them off.

35:14.204 --> 35:16.274
Some of your theories
strike me as prehistoric.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.480
Besides, they downgrade property values.

35:18.564 --> 35:21.636
I know the supernatural is something
that isn't supposed to happen.

35:21.724 --> 35:23.077
Yet it does happen.

35:23.164 --> 35:27.157
Ghosts make the papers along
with celebrities every day of the week.

35:27.484 --> 35:29.076
If it happens to you...

35:29.444 --> 35:32.038
you're liable to have
that shut door in your mind...

35:32.124 --> 35:33.682
ripped right off its hinges.

35:33.764 --> 35:36.801
Look, Doc, we're buddies,
but don't try to convert me.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.795
I'm trying to prepare you.

35:40.044 --> 35:43.559
There's something going on in this house
or l wouldn't be here.

35:43.644 --> 35:44.679
What?

35:46.724 --> 35:50.558
Don't ask me to give a name
to something which hasn't got a name.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.317
I don't know.

35:56.724 --> 35:59.522
Tomorrow we'll see all the place.
Now let's go to bed.

35:59.604 --> 36:01.276
Unless anyone wants to clear out now...

36:01.364 --> 36:03.480
and not have anything more to do
with Hill House.

36:03.564 --> 36:06.283
I hope to have plenty
to do with it someday, moneywise.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.480
We couldn't leave now
even if we wanted to.

36:08.564 --> 36:12.113
-You mean l'm holding you prisoner?
-I mean Dudley keeps the gates locked.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.115
We could always break out.

36:14.604 --> 36:17.402
I have a key to the gate
anytime you want it.

36:17.524 --> 36:20.038
-I wouldn't dream of leaving.
-Thank you.

36:20.644 --> 36:22.157
Adventurers all.

36:22.884 --> 36:25.398
But you mustn't expect every night
to be Halloween.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.952
Psychic phenomena
are subject to certain laws.

36:28.044 --> 36:29.796
And just what are these laws?

36:29.884 --> 36:32.318
You won't know until you break them.

36:32.564 --> 36:36.398
At the end of each day, you have to fill
out these forms l've had mimeographed.

36:36.484 --> 36:37.997
Very scientific, aren't we?

36:38.084 --> 36:40.803
The really scientific phase
won't start for a while yet.

36:40.884 --> 36:43.079
First of all, we have to get orientated.

36:43.164 --> 36:45.439
What's this? Looks like "psy-kookiness."

36:45.524 --> 36:47.196
Nothing like that wrong with me.

36:47.284 --> 36:49.354
Psychokinesis is just the technical form...

36:49.444 --> 36:51.753
for what you'd call
objects moving by themselves.

36:51.844 --> 36:53.163
Actually, they don't...

36:53.244 --> 36:57.203
but are moved by a force from somewhere
which we call psychokinesis.

36:59.404 --> 37:00.519
I see.

37:01.404 --> 37:03.599
About this ghost
l can expect in my room tonight...

37:03.684 --> 37:05.800
tell me, is it male or female?

37:07.684 --> 37:09.561
Good night, ladies, Doc.

37:11.444 --> 37:14.914
I just thought of something.
Nobody locked the front door.

37:15.204 --> 37:17.160
Won't make any difference.

37:17.964 --> 37:19.033
I see.

37:21.644 --> 37:23.555
-Good night, Dr. Markway.
-John.

37:24.284 --> 37:27.594
Good night, Theo.
Get a good rest, Eleanor. Sleep well.

37:28.204 --> 37:31.879
I'll turn the lights off below,
in case you wonder who did it.

37:32.964 --> 37:36.036
If you feel in the least bit nervous,
just run right into my room.

37:36.124 --> 37:37.762
Thanks. Good night.

37:38.164 --> 37:40.120
I'll come in for a second.

37:40.244 --> 37:43.714
You've been thinking of changing
your hair. I know just the style for you.

37:43.804 --> 37:46.921
Why, yes. I was. But l'm awfully tired.

37:47.524 --> 37:50.834
-Thanks anyhow.
-Okay. We have a date for breakfast.

37:51.404 --> 37:52.996
Good night, Theo.

38:16.404 --> 38:19.362
Funny. Everything's so ugly
and yet so comfortable.

38:21.244 --> 38:23.075
Like drowning, l guess.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.483
Now l can think about them. I'm all alone.

38:33.524 --> 38:34.673
Alone.

38:45.844 --> 38:47.800
He won't know l locked it.

38:49.804 --> 38:51.476
Against what, Eleanor?

39:20.164 --> 39:21.802
All right, Mother.

39:26.444 --> 39:28.400
Just a minute. I'm coming.

39:36.724 --> 39:38.919
What, Theo?

39:39.004 --> 39:40.562
Nell, in here!

39:44.324 --> 39:45.962
I'm here. What is it?

39:49.364 --> 39:51.400
I thought it was you pounding.

39:51.484 --> 39:53.714
It was. I mean, l did.

39:54.764 --> 39:57.801
But now it's down
near the other end of the hall.

40:00.364 --> 40:03.401
It's not at all like Mother
knocking on the wall.

40:03.724 --> 40:07.763
It's only a noise,
and the room is terribly cold.

40:08.644 --> 40:10.521
Terribly, terribly cold.

40:12.324 --> 40:14.440
It must be Luke and Dr. Markway.

40:14.724 --> 40:16.760
Why should they be knocking
on the walls?

40:16.844 --> 40:19.563
Something is. Anyway, it's only a noise.

40:19.844 --> 40:21.277
Earth tremors?

40:38.164 --> 40:42.123
Maybe it'll go down
on the other side of the hall.

41:14.404 --> 41:16.474
-No!
-Go away!

41:26.044 --> 41:27.557
Now l've done it.

41:27.684 --> 41:30.676
It was looking for the room
with someone inside.

41:37.924 --> 41:39.323
You big baby.

41:40.524 --> 41:42.879
Whatever it is, it's just a noise.

41:43.004 --> 41:45.154
-I'm cold.
-So am l.

41:46.684 --> 41:49.039
-Where's Luke? Where's Markway?
-I don't know.

41:49.124 --> 41:50.637
-Warmer now?
-No.

41:51.404 --> 41:53.964
In a minute
l'll go out in the hall and call them.

41:54.044 --> 41:55.636
Are you all right?

41:55.964 --> 41:57.192
Oh, God, Nell!

42:00.244 --> 42:02.360
It's against the top of the door!

42:16.324 --> 42:17.552
It's found us.

42:18.564 --> 42:22.079
Now l know why people scream,
because l think l'm going to.

42:24.484 --> 42:26.122
Is the door locked?

43:05.924 --> 43:07.516
You can't get in!

43:38.724 --> 43:39.839
It's over.

43:41.124 --> 43:43.513
-How do you know?
-Can't you feel it?

43:43.884 --> 43:46.876
Aren't you warm again?
That terrible cold has gone.

43:47.364 --> 43:48.479
Why, yes.

43:49.404 --> 43:53.158
Intense cold is one of the symptoms
of shock. My mother--

43:53.244 --> 43:56.122
Intense shock
is one of the symptoms l've got.

44:03.404 --> 44:05.122
Where have you two been?

44:05.204 --> 44:07.513
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

44:07.604 --> 44:09.196
Did anything happen?

44:22.244 --> 44:24.041
Nothing in particular...

44:25.764 --> 44:28.722
just something knocked on the door
with a cannonball...

44:29.964 --> 44:31.682
then tried to get in and eat us.

44:31.764 --> 44:33.163
I'm with Nell.

44:34.244 --> 44:36.997
Miss ESP and Bridey Murphy,
some combination.

44:37.284 --> 44:40.037
-There isn't a scratch on the wood.
-Or anywhere else.

44:40.124 --> 44:42.513
How nice, it didn't mar the woodwork.

44:45.364 --> 44:47.400
Where were you, Dr. Markway?

44:47.764 --> 44:49.197
Chasing a dog.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.913
At least, we assumed it was a dog.

44:52.044 --> 44:53.875
We followed it outside.

44:56.284 --> 44:57.922
You mean it was inside?

44:58.004 --> 45:00.313
I thought l heard something
run past my room.

45:00.404 --> 45:03.043
I woke Luke. We went looking for it
all over the house...

45:03.124 --> 45:04.477
and finally out in the garden.

45:04.564 --> 45:07.681
But let's face it, girls,
we didn't get very far from the house.

45:07.764 --> 45:10.324
Then you must've heard
that ungodly noise.

45:11.284 --> 45:14.082
No, there wasn't a sound from the house.

45:14.724 --> 45:16.954
At least, nothing audible to us.

45:20.884 --> 45:23.682
-We'd better take precautions.
-Against what?

45:24.484 --> 45:27.203
When Luke and l are decoyed outside...

45:27.924 --> 45:30.233
and you two are bottled up inside...

45:30.324 --> 45:34.237
wouldn't you say that something,
somehow, is trying to separate us?

45:59.404 --> 46:01.360
Good morning, Dr. Markway.

46:01.444 --> 46:04.197
'Morning, and please call me John.

46:06.084 --> 46:09.440
-This curious life seems to agree with you.
-Thank you.

46:09.564 --> 46:11.475
-Tea or coffee?
-Tea, please.

46:11.844 --> 46:13.960
How is it you look so pretty
after last night?

46:14.044 --> 46:15.716
That was last night.

46:15.884 --> 46:17.954
There may have been a little noise.

46:19.084 --> 46:21.678
One has to expect that
in these old houses.

46:22.084 --> 46:24.803
I give up. I was sure you'd be packed
and on your way.

46:24.884 --> 46:25.794
Not likely.

46:25.884 --> 46:28.682
This is my first vacation in years
and l'm going to enjoy it.

46:28.764 --> 46:32.074
That's the point. You need a real vacation.
This isn't the place for one.

46:32.164 --> 46:33.961
I mean to stay. Period.

46:34.444 --> 46:36.639
Unless, of course,
you want to get rid of me.

46:36.724 --> 46:38.521
No, you mustn't think that.

46:39.084 --> 46:42.042
Till last night
you were just a name on my list.

46:42.124 --> 46:44.160
I scarcely know Eleanor Lance.

46:44.244 --> 46:46.712
-She's horrible.
-No, you mustn't make fun of me.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.523
You're sweet and pleasant
and everyone likes you very much.

46:49.604 --> 46:51.720
I want to know more about you.

46:52.444 --> 46:55.993
I dislike lobster,
crack my knuckles when l'm nervous...

46:57.244 --> 46:59.838
save buttons, and sleep on my left side.

47:00.564 --> 47:02.236
Why on the left side?

47:02.324 --> 47:05.361
I read someplace
it wears the heart out quicker.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.360
That's a depressing thought.

47:09.444 --> 47:12.834
For the past 1 1 years l've been
walled up alive on a desert island.

47:12.924 --> 47:16.234
I thought you might be hiding
some dark romantic secret in your past.

47:16.324 --> 47:17.518
Romantic?

47:18.604 --> 47:21.994
I've spent all my adult life
taking care of my invalid mother...

47:22.444 --> 47:23.923
until she died.

47:24.084 --> 47:25.915
No, it wasn't romantic.

47:26.484 --> 47:30.272
Now that you're free at last, you shouldn't
be wasting your time in Hill House.

47:30.364 --> 47:32.673
-It's a mistake.
-But it isn't, don't you see?

47:32.764 --> 47:34.880
The only thing that kept me going...

47:35.204 --> 47:37.320
was that someday
l knew something would happen.

47:37.404 --> 47:40.680
Something truly extraordinary,
like Hill House.

47:41.884 --> 47:43.761
Yes, it's extraordinary.

47:44.524 --> 47:46.754
What'll you do when you get back?
Do you have a job?

47:46.844 --> 47:49.916
No job, nothing.
I don't know what l'm going to do.

47:51.364 --> 47:53.719
You wouldn't send me back, would you?

47:53.804 --> 47:55.681
That depends on what happens.

47:56.604 --> 47:58.595
We may all have to go back.

47:58.724 --> 48:00.157
But l won't give up easily.

48:00.244 --> 48:03.281
How did you get so interested
in the supernatural?

48:03.764 --> 48:07.518
I didn't want to become
what my father called a practical man.

48:08.164 --> 48:11.315
I come from one of those
respectable English families...

48:11.404 --> 48:14.202
that dragged all the Victorian virtues
into the 20th century.

48:14.284 --> 48:16.161
In a Gladstone bag, of course.

48:16.244 --> 48:18.712
Everything had to be practical
and conventional.

48:18.804 --> 48:20.283
So my first reaction as a kid...

48:20.364 --> 48:23.242
was to choose something useless
and unconventional. Like ghosts.

48:23.324 --> 48:25.360
But you're an anthropologist now.

48:25.724 --> 48:28.636
When l refused to read law at Oxford
as my father had...

48:28.724 --> 48:30.396
there was a terrific row.

48:30.564 --> 48:33.237
I took off for America,
without my Gladstone bag...

48:33.324 --> 48:35.155
and worked my way through college.

48:35.244 --> 48:37.280
I decided on anthropology
because it seemed...

48:37.364 --> 48:39.594
to be a short step
from the study of dead souls...

48:39.684 --> 48:42.642
to the study of dead men
and dead civilizations.

48:42.724 --> 48:44.601
I'm not very practical, either.

48:45.004 --> 48:47.313
But it didn't occur to me
till l was hooked...

48:47.404 --> 48:50.521
that my combined knowledge
of anthropology and psychic phenomena...

48:50.604 --> 48:52.913
had led me on to something very practical.

48:53.124 --> 48:56.434
You see, if ghosts,
which are pure spirit, come from man...

48:56.524 --> 48:59.641
then perhaps it's possible some day
to have individuals...

48:59.844 --> 49:03.962
whose spiritual caliber far surpasses
anything humanity has yet known.

49:04.284 --> 49:06.844
Human nature could certainly stand
some improvements.

49:06.924 --> 49:09.518
However, my idea remains pure theory...

49:09.604 --> 49:12.755
until somebody proves definitely
the supernatural exists.

49:13.484 --> 49:16.442
Anyway, that's enough about me.
Now tell me about last night.

49:17.324 --> 49:18.359
Thank you.

49:18.444 --> 49:20.594
I've been trying to remember.

49:20.684 --> 49:23.278
I can remember
knowing l was frightened...

49:23.604 --> 49:27.153
but l can't remember
actually being frightened, or how l felt.

49:27.484 --> 49:29.395
I think it's because it was so unreal.

49:29.484 --> 49:32.237
Still could be subterranean waters,
you know.

49:32.324 --> 49:35.282
I hope not.
That wouldn't be nearly so exciting.

49:35.764 --> 49:38.232
Not good, this feeling of excitement.

49:38.764 --> 49:42.518
It's the first sign
you've fallen under the spell of the house.

49:42.884 --> 49:45.000
Maybe it isn't just the house.

49:45.524 --> 49:47.003
Then what else?

49:49.564 --> 49:51.555
Let's blame it on sunspots.

49:52.764 --> 49:54.994
Well, it wasn't sunspots last night.

49:55.644 --> 49:59.159
If anyone gets hurt,
it's going to be your fault, Markway.

49:59.764 --> 50:03.552
No ghost in all the long history of ghosts
ever hurt anyone physically.

50:03.644 --> 50:06.681
We weren't in any actual danger at all,
isn't that right, John?

50:06.764 --> 50:07.992
No, not entirely.

50:08.084 --> 50:10.200
Fear alone can do the damage
to the victim.

50:10.284 --> 50:13.401
Prehistoric man, for instance,
could die of fright during an eclipse.

50:13.484 --> 50:16.078
-Poor sap.
-You mean poor homo sapiens.

50:17.404 --> 50:20.476
A modern man can react
with the same unreasoning terror...

50:20.564 --> 50:21.883
to a supernatural event.

50:21.964 --> 50:24.717
Especially if he doesn't believe
that the supernatural exists.

50:24.804 --> 50:27.955
I've always been more afraid
of being left alone or left out...

50:28.044 --> 50:30.512
than of things that go bump in the night.

50:31.324 --> 50:33.235
What are you afraid of, Theo?

50:33.604 --> 50:35.754
Of knowing what l really want.

50:37.444 --> 50:40.834
-Good morning, fellow earthlings.
-Luke, what are you afraid of?.

50:40.924 --> 50:42.960
What l just saw in the hall.

50:43.284 --> 50:46.196
-Is there something?
-You mean you haven't seen it?

50:47.164 --> 50:49.553
The show's just getting good. Come on.

50:55.084 --> 50:56.153
Right here.

50:58.764 --> 51:00.163
It's writing?

51:00.604 --> 51:01.719
Writing.

51:04.844 --> 51:05.959
Chalk.

51:08.444 --> 51:10.116
Or something like chalk.

51:20.004 --> 51:21.722
-Can you read it?
-No.

51:29.924 --> 51:30.993
What?

51:33.604 --> 51:34.832
No.

51:35.324 --> 51:38.282
Wipe it off, please. It's crazy.

51:38.724 --> 51:40.601
Crazy is the word for it, all right.

51:40.684 --> 51:43.801
-Get something and wipe it off, Luke.
-But it's crazy. Why?

51:43.884 --> 51:46.398
Why all the fuss?
lt spelled her name right, didn't it?

51:46.484 --> 51:48.634
-Those letters spelled out my name.
-Take it easy.

51:48.724 --> 51:52.114
It's my name!
lt belongs to me and something is using it.

51:52.204 --> 51:54.115
Writing it and calling me
with my own name!

51:54.204 --> 51:56.195
-Just because your name--
-That's it!

51:56.284 --> 51:58.354
It knows my name, doesn't it?

51:58.524 --> 52:00.799
-It knows my name!
-Simmer down, Nell.

52:00.884 --> 52:03.352
It could have said any of us.
It knows all our names.

52:03.444 --> 52:06.516
Did you write it? Please tell me.
I won't be angry or anything.

52:06.604 --> 52:08.754
I just want to know so that....

52:08.844 --> 52:11.312
Maybe it was only for a joke
to frighten me.

52:11.764 --> 52:13.880
You know none of us wrote it, baby.

52:13.964 --> 52:16.114
-She's lying, l could swear she did it.
-Easy.

52:16.204 --> 52:17.876
I clear breakfast at 10:00.

52:17.964 --> 52:20.398
-Why should l write your name?
-I set lunch at 1 :00.

52:20.484 --> 52:22.440
Because l didn't wait
to have breakfast with you.

52:22.524 --> 52:25.038
-You're way out.
-You don't know Theo as l'm beginning to.

52:25.124 --> 52:27.558
-I clear up at 10:00.
-Mrs. Dudley, please!

52:27.844 --> 52:30.438
-No one blames you for being upset.
-It's 10:00.

52:30.524 --> 52:32.754
Why me? Why should l be the one chosen?

52:32.844 --> 52:35.233
Maybe something in the house
finds you a kindred spirit.

52:35.324 --> 52:38.839
Maybe it thinks you have more
understanding and sympathy than we do.

52:39.324 --> 52:41.042
Maybe you wrote it yourself.

52:41.124 --> 52:43.479
Sure, l'm just the kind
to want to see my name...

52:43.564 --> 52:47.239
-scribbled all over this foul house!
-It's one way to attract attention, isn't it?

52:47.324 --> 52:49.884
You think l like the idea
l'm the center of attention?

52:49.964 --> 52:52.842
Why are you all done up
in that new hairstyle?

52:56.124 --> 52:58.513
-You were the one who suggested--
-That's enough.

52:58.604 --> 53:00.083
How dare you?

53:00.164 --> 53:02.883
Can't you see Theo's just trying
to get a rise out of you...

53:02.964 --> 53:05.353
so you won't be frightened anymore?

53:07.844 --> 53:09.118
I'm sorry.

53:09.524 --> 53:11.162
Take Eleanor to her room.

53:11.564 --> 53:13.475
We'll postpone the tour of the house.

53:13.564 --> 53:16.874
Okay, but don't forget.
I don't want to spend another night...

53:16.964 --> 53:19.524
wondering what's over my head
or underneath me.

53:21.884 --> 53:24.159
You wouldn't leave me behind, would you?

53:24.484 --> 53:26.315
No one will leave you behind.

53:38.444 --> 53:39.797
Holy cow! Mount Rushmore!

53:39.884 --> 53:42.876
-It's not there. I don't believe it's there.
-How?

53:43.484 --> 53:45.202
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.

53:45.284 --> 53:48.003
It's supposed to be St. Francis
curing the lepers.

53:48.484 --> 53:50.395
I'd say it's a family portrait.

53:50.564 --> 53:51.679
A composite.

53:52.004 --> 53:54.564
The tall, draped, masculine type...

53:54.644 --> 53:56.714
that's old Hugh Crain...

53:56.804 --> 54:00.240
pointing out all the great treasures
in this creepy house he built.

54:00.324 --> 54:03.634
The dame on the end down there
and this one must be his two wives.

54:03.724 --> 54:05.555
His daughter, Abigail.

54:06.164 --> 54:08.917
-Now the dog....
-The dog you were chasing last night.

54:09.284 --> 54:10.922
Yeah, very good.

54:11.964 --> 54:14.558
Now that one,
she's got to be the companion.

54:14.684 --> 54:17.278
The one who's supposed
to have murdered Abigail.

54:17.364 --> 54:20.276
No, that was much later.
When Abigail was an old lady.

54:21.084 --> 54:24.554
I wonder how this statue got here.
It wasn't on the original inventory.

54:24.644 --> 54:26.680
Maybe l'll break it up
and sell it for tombstones.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.755
The companion reminds me of you, Nell.

54:28.844 --> 54:30.197
Oh, no!

54:30.444 --> 54:31.763
She does at that.

54:32.444 --> 54:34.355
A natural beauty, l'd call her.

54:36.364 --> 54:38.355
What does he think of me, really?

54:38.844 --> 54:40.163
Am l being a fool?

54:41.204 --> 54:44.241
Don't let me know too surely
what he thinks of me.

54:44.644 --> 54:46.839
This could be a family portrait of us.

54:46.924 --> 54:49.722
-Don't be ridiculous.
-You're the companion.

54:50.164 --> 54:52.394
I'm Abigail, grown up.

54:52.924 --> 54:54.755
And Markway could be old Hugh.

54:55.004 --> 54:57.074
-Where do l fit in?
-The dog.

54:58.884 --> 55:00.954
When are you going to show me your ESP?

55:01.044 --> 55:02.682
Keep your hands to yourself.

55:02.764 --> 55:04.277
What's going on?

55:05.444 --> 55:07.082
More than meets the eye.

55:08.124 --> 55:12.003
You know, this wouldn't be
such a bad room without the statue.

55:12.444 --> 55:14.719
Ideal for the zombies' annual ball.

55:16.924 --> 55:19.802
Why don't you dance with Hugh?
l believe he has his eye on you.

55:19.884 --> 55:21.317
-That's not funny.
-Don't be chicken.

55:21.404 --> 55:23.964
-Leave her alone.
-I bet she doesn't know how to dance.

55:24.044 --> 55:25.238
I do, too.

55:29.084 --> 55:31.518
Hugh Crain, will you dance with me?

55:32.764 --> 55:34.675
I believe he's going to accept.

55:48.044 --> 55:49.921
-He moved.
-Of course.

55:50.004 --> 55:53.076
Haven't you noticed how nothing
in the house moves till you look away...

55:53.164 --> 55:56.759
and then you just catch something
out of the corner of your eye?

55:58.964 --> 56:00.443
She stepped on my toe.

56:01.564 --> 56:04.317
Let's go out this way
before somebody gets hurt.

56:08.044 --> 56:11.320
Come over here, l want to show you
something really unique.

56:20.124 --> 56:22.433
A library complete with ivory tower.

56:24.404 --> 56:25.962
I can't go in there.

56:27.604 --> 56:29.401
-My mother....
-Yes?

56:30.324 --> 56:31.473
That smell....

56:33.644 --> 56:37.114
-It's just stale air, Eleanor.
-No, that other smell.... Awful.

56:38.244 --> 56:39.962
Smells sweet to me, honey.

56:40.084 --> 56:43.520
At 25 cents a book,
l should do all right with this room.

56:43.604 --> 56:46.835
I don't think l'll do much reading
while l'm here.

56:47.124 --> 56:50.355
-Not if the books smell like the library.
-I didn't notice it.

56:50.964 --> 56:53.558
No, that's good, Eleanor.
It's just what we're after.

56:53.644 --> 56:56.238
Try and remember your reaction
and describe it exactly...

56:56.324 --> 56:59.122
-when you write your notes tonight.
-That's what l'm here for.

56:59.204 --> 57:02.162
Only, do you mind
if l skip the library for now?

57:02.244 --> 57:05.156
No, do just what you want.
We'll only be a minute.

57:07.764 --> 57:09.834
-You're sure you're all right?
-Yes.

57:16.084 --> 57:18.314
I want to show you something
really interesting.

57:18.404 --> 57:21.043
You remember that companion,
the one that Abigail had...

57:21.124 --> 57:23.877
when she was an old lady?
See that little balcony...

57:24.884 --> 57:27.921
clear up at the top there,
right up there in the shadows?

57:29.044 --> 57:30.921
That's where the companion
hanged herself.

57:31.004 --> 57:33.518
-It would have been easier to jump.
-Without a parachute?

57:33.604 --> 57:35.959
They say she tied the rope
on to the railing and then--

57:36.044 --> 57:37.636
Thanks, we get it.

57:37.844 --> 57:39.277
I just had a great idea.

57:39.364 --> 57:43.039
You know what l'll do with this room?
After l inherit the house, of course.

57:43.124 --> 57:44.762
I'll turn it into a nightclub.

57:44.844 --> 57:47.597
Tear out these bookshelves
and put a band in there.

57:48.684 --> 57:49.912
Now comes the best part.

57:50.004 --> 57:52.723
A line of beautiful chorus girls
dancing down these stairs.

57:52.804 --> 57:54.078
Can't you see it?

57:58.804 --> 58:00.760
-Are you all right?
-I think so.

58:00.844 --> 58:02.357
-Quick thinking.
-Instinct.

58:02.444 --> 58:05.004
My strong instinct for self-preservation.

58:05.084 --> 58:08.872
And it's telling me right now
loud and clear to get the hell out of here.

58:18.324 --> 58:20.042
Vile. Hideous.

58:31.124 --> 58:34.082
I wonder what it would be like
looking down from there.

58:34.884 --> 58:36.681
That's where she did it.

58:37.364 --> 58:38.683
From that window.

58:39.484 --> 58:41.679
Climbing out through the bars...

58:42.484 --> 58:46.477
hanging on for an instant, hanging on....

58:52.124 --> 58:53.842
Eleanor, you'll fall!

58:54.644 --> 58:56.396
Didn't you hear me calling?

58:56.844 --> 59:00.075
This house,
you have to watch it every minute.

59:04.164 --> 59:07.793
I didn't realize you were so nervous.
I think l should send you home.

59:07.884 --> 59:11.001
-No, please, l can't go home.
-It's no reflection on you.

59:11.084 --> 59:13.154
An atmosphere like this
might break anyone down.

59:13.244 --> 59:14.962
But l'm not breaking down.

59:15.284 --> 59:16.842
I did hear noises last night.

59:16.924 --> 59:19.279
Something was trying to get
into the room.

59:22.324 --> 59:26.954
You realize that if even one event
is proved to be a hallucination...

59:27.764 --> 59:30.278
then this whole experiment
will be questioned.

59:31.124 --> 59:33.319
I'm not crazy, you know.

59:33.604 --> 59:37.563
After all, Theo was there, too.
Is it my fault it just didn't make sense?

59:42.924 --> 59:44.721
We'll let it go for now.

59:45.924 --> 59:48.518
-Maybe l'm just being selfish.
-Selfish?

59:48.724 --> 59:51.318
Keeping you here
for the sake of the experiment.

59:51.964 --> 59:54.797
Of course, for the sake of the experiment.

59:54.884 --> 59:57.159
You do seem to be the main attraction...

59:58.164 --> 59:59.916
for whatever's in the house.

01:00:00.084 --> 01:00:04.043
-But l'll send you back the minute--
-No, please. I'm all right. Really l am.

01:00:07.284 --> 01:00:09.400
Well, don't you two look cozy.

01:00:11.084 --> 01:00:13.837
She was halfway off the verandah
when l caught her.

01:00:14.404 --> 01:00:17.362
I was leaning back
to see the top of the tower.

01:00:17.844 --> 01:00:20.233
-I got dizzy.
-Dizzy like a fox?

01:00:22.364 --> 01:00:23.479
Poor Nell.

01:00:23.764 --> 01:00:26.722
You look like death. Let's go inside.

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:34.679
I think you'd better move in with Eleanor.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.995
-You're the doctor.
-But that's my room, my very own room.

01:00:38.164 --> 01:00:41.839
I wouldn't want to risk either of you
spending another night alone.

01:00:42.604 --> 01:00:44.356
Don't get all hung up, Nell.

01:00:44.924 --> 01:00:47.882
We'll have fun. Like sisters.

01:00:56.204 --> 01:00:58.115
-It tickles.
-Of course.

01:00:58.844 --> 01:01:00.562
Your toes are tickled pink.

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:03.113
I knew my shade would suit you perfectly.

01:01:04.124 --> 01:01:06.479
Have another drink.
It will keep the chill out.

01:01:06.564 --> 01:01:08.873
Just a teensy one. To keep the chill out.

01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:12.564
-I don't really like whisky.
-This is brandy.

01:01:14.444 --> 01:01:18.039
By the time l'm through with you, Nell,
you'll be a different person.

01:01:20.084 --> 01:01:21.358
It's wicked.

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:23.643
I mean, on my foot.

01:01:23.964 --> 01:01:26.558
You've got foolishness
and wickedness mixed up.

01:01:27.444 --> 01:01:28.763
Maybe.

01:01:29.164 --> 01:01:31.758
Haven't had much chance
to learn the difference.

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:35.442
Know something?
Even when l'd play solitaire in my room...

01:01:35.524 --> 01:01:37.719
she'd bang on the wall
and make me feel guilty...

01:01:37.804 --> 01:01:40.079
for leaving her alone just that little bit.

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:42.200
-She'd always--
-Your mother?

01:01:43.924 --> 01:01:46.233
My mother....

01:01:49.124 --> 01:01:50.876
Story of my dull life.

01:01:52.724 --> 01:01:54.476
What's your apartment like?

01:01:54.724 --> 01:01:58.717
It's an old place we furnished ourselves
from stuff we picked up in the junk shops.

01:01:58.804 --> 01:02:00.874
We both love fixing over old things.

01:02:01.124 --> 01:02:02.239
Like me.

01:02:05.364 --> 01:02:06.479
You married?

01:02:07.604 --> 01:02:08.559
No.

01:02:10.324 --> 01:02:11.518
I'm sorry.

01:02:13.324 --> 01:02:16.157
I'm stupid and wicked
and untrustworthy...

01:02:16.244 --> 01:02:18.963
-and not good for anything at all.
-I don't think so.

01:02:19.044 --> 01:02:21.433
Maybe just a little tight at the moment.

01:02:22.084 --> 01:02:24.359
Tell me something about where you live.

01:02:28.164 --> 01:02:31.315
I haven't had it long enough
to believe it's my own.

01:02:31.684 --> 01:02:35.279
It's a little apartment.
Smaller than yours, l'm sure.

01:02:35.924 --> 01:02:38.484
I live alone. I'm still furnishing it.

01:02:39.324 --> 01:02:43.283
Buying one thing at a time
to make sure l get everything right.

01:02:45.124 --> 01:02:49.276
Took me two weeks to find
the little stone lions l keep on the mantel.

01:02:50.604 --> 01:02:52.435
Brush their teeth every night.

01:02:53.284 --> 01:02:56.879
I've got a hunch l better get you back
to your apartment as fast as l can.

01:02:56.964 --> 01:02:58.522
-Don't say that.
-I only mean--

01:02:58.604 --> 01:03:00.117
Why do you all pick on me?

01:03:00.204 --> 01:03:03.196
Am l the public dump or something
for everybody's fear?

01:03:06.764 --> 01:03:09.403
I don't want to leave Hill House ever.

01:03:12.404 --> 01:03:15.760
I've been waiting all my life
for something like this to happen.

01:03:17.284 --> 01:03:19.639
Hey, everybody, come here.
I've found something.

01:03:26.244 --> 01:03:27.802
What's wrong with you, Doc?

01:03:27.884 --> 01:03:31.672
Stand there, go on.
You, too, girls. Stand there.

01:03:35.324 --> 01:03:37.713
A genuine cold spot.

01:03:37.844 --> 01:03:40.438
I guarantee it won't register
on any thermometer.

01:03:40.524 --> 01:03:43.084
Bunk. It's just a draft, that's all.

01:03:43.724 --> 01:03:46.477
-Coming from somewhere.
-A draft? ln Hill House?

01:03:46.564 --> 01:03:48.998
Not unless you can make
one of the doors stay open.

01:03:49.084 --> 01:03:52.599
No, l found it. The heart of Hill House.

01:03:53.044 --> 01:03:54.921
You mean where we're standing?

01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:56.843
Behind these doors.

01:03:57.644 --> 01:03:59.521
-What's in there?
-The nursery.

01:03:59.924 --> 01:04:02.563
Abigail Crain grew up and died there.

01:04:04.084 --> 01:04:07.201
-Just the place to chill our beer.
-No, don't go in there.

01:04:07.524 --> 01:04:11.403
We'll keep the lid on the pressure cooker
a while longer, then.

01:04:11.604 --> 01:04:13.356
Now don't give me that, Doc.

01:04:13.484 --> 01:04:15.873
It's like the doorway to a tomb.

01:04:16.564 --> 01:04:17.838
Bless you.

01:04:19.084 --> 01:04:20.756
Now, that's enough, girls.

01:04:20.844 --> 01:04:23.119
You'd better run along to bed
before you catch cold.

01:04:23.204 --> 01:04:25.115
Yes, teacher. Bless you.

01:04:25.604 --> 01:04:26.559
Come on.

01:04:39.604 --> 01:04:41.560
No. There's got to be a draft.

01:04:43.804 --> 01:04:45.396
The floor's solid.

01:04:45.924 --> 01:04:48.677
Look, Doc, don't give me
any of that supernatural jazz.

01:04:48.764 --> 01:04:52.723
This is something l can feel. And see.

01:04:53.204 --> 01:04:55.923
Maybe there's a pipeline to the North Pole.

01:04:56.244 --> 01:05:00.032
Why won't you accept it for what it is:
a supernatural phenomenon?

01:05:00.204 --> 01:05:02.274
You knock on wood, don't you?

01:05:02.684 --> 01:05:05.118
Yeah, what's that got to do with it?

01:05:05.404 --> 01:05:07.759
It shows that even you, despite yourself...

01:05:07.844 --> 01:05:11.723
feel that there are forces
beyond nature able to help or hurt us.

01:05:12.684 --> 01:05:13.639
Wait a minute.

01:05:13.724 --> 01:05:16.079
Are you telling me that belief
in a superstition...

01:05:16.164 --> 01:05:18.758
is the same thing
as believing in the supernatural?

01:05:18.844 --> 01:05:20.323
It's food for thought.

01:05:24.124 --> 01:05:25.762
Frozen food for thought.

01:05:32.484 --> 01:05:33.803
You know what l think?

01:05:33.884 --> 01:05:36.637
Markway has us all so edgy,
we're getting the cold sweats.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.238
The temperature needn't drop
to make you feel like that.

01:05:39.324 --> 01:05:40.723
That's right.

01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:42.715
Music gives me goose bumps.

01:05:43.364 --> 01:05:45.594
Still, there was that awful smell
in the library.

01:05:45.684 --> 01:05:47.481
Here we go again. You know very well...

01:05:47.564 --> 01:05:50.920
what you thought you smelled
in the library. The sickroom smell.

01:05:51.804 --> 01:05:54.113
Let's discuss me some other time.

01:05:54.764 --> 01:05:56.038
I'm tired.

01:05:56.724 --> 01:05:59.397
-Turn out the light.
-I'd like it on. Have you seen this?

01:05:59.484 --> 01:06:02.635
I told you. I just want to go to sleep.
Good night!

01:06:04.524 --> 01:06:07.880
Why be mad at me?
l don't think you killed your mother.

01:06:12.644 --> 01:06:13.872
Leave me alone.

01:06:15.364 --> 01:06:16.433
Go to sleep!

01:06:16.844 --> 01:06:18.516
Good night, Nellie my Nell.

01:07:15.484 --> 01:07:18.442
Are you awake?
Don't say a word, Theo. Not a word.

01:07:18.964 --> 01:07:21.034
Don't let it know you're in my room.

01:07:42.764 --> 01:07:44.163
Hold my hand.

01:07:47.204 --> 01:07:49.001
And for God's sake, don't scream.

01:08:14.484 --> 01:08:17.282
Is it over? Do you think it's over?

01:08:19.084 --> 01:08:20.676
You're breaking my hand.

01:08:40.724 --> 01:08:42.760
This is monstrous. This is cruel.

01:08:42.924 --> 01:08:46.314
It is hurting a child
and l will not let anyone...

01:08:46.404 --> 01:08:47.996
anything hurt a child.

01:08:48.604 --> 01:08:51.323
I won't endure this. It thinks to scare me.

01:08:51.404 --> 01:08:53.234
It has, and poor Theo, too.

01:08:53.644 --> 01:08:56.875
Honestly, it feels like
she's breaking my hand.

01:09:05.044 --> 01:09:07.683
I will take a lot
from this filthy house for his sake...

01:09:07.764 --> 01:09:11.154
but l will not go along
with hurting a child. No, l will not.

01:09:11.524 --> 01:09:15.915
I will get my mouth to open right now,
and l will yell.

01:09:18.124 --> 01:09:19.796
Stop it!

01:09:26.604 --> 01:09:28.162
What, Nell?

01:09:33.964 --> 01:09:34.919
Oh, God!

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:41.962
Whose hand was l holding?

01:10:09.484 --> 01:10:12.521
-Eleanor, too bad. You just missed it.
-What?

01:10:12.924 --> 01:10:15.154
The Hill House Concerto for Harp.

01:10:16.524 --> 01:10:18.196
Were you playing the harp?

01:10:18.404 --> 01:10:19.917
It was playing itself.

01:10:21.044 --> 01:10:23.239
Naturally. How do you explain it?

01:10:23.724 --> 01:10:25.794
Subterranean waters? Earth tremors?

01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:29.633
As a matter of fact,
l don't think it is anything supernatural.

01:10:29.844 --> 01:10:31.482
The self-starting music.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.442
More likely it's in the realm
of the preternatural.

01:10:34.524 --> 01:10:37.482
Something we don't have
any natural explanation for right now...

01:10:37.564 --> 01:10:39.634
but probably will have some day.

01:10:39.724 --> 01:10:43.478
The preternatural of one generation
becomes the natural of the next.

01:10:44.724 --> 01:10:48.433
Not so long ago, scientists laughed
at the idea of magnetic attraction.

01:10:48.964 --> 01:10:52.479
They couldn't explain it,
so they refused to admit it existed.

01:10:52.964 --> 01:10:55.398
Life is still full of the preternatural.

01:10:55.924 --> 01:10:57.118
My mother....

01:10:57.604 --> 01:11:00.198
Go on. Say it.
You've been trying to since you got here.

01:11:00.284 --> 01:11:03.754
I don't know what l was going to say.
I'm still so terrified from last night.

01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:06.278
You shouldn't be.
It's silly to be frightened.

01:11:06.364 --> 01:11:08.082
You haven't been through it.

01:11:08.844 --> 01:11:10.800
This horrible unknown thing.

01:11:10.964 --> 01:11:13.273
Unknown. That's the key word.

01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:15.835
When we get involved
in a supernatural event...

01:11:15.924 --> 01:11:18.836
we're scared out of our wits
just because it's unknown.

01:11:18.924 --> 01:11:20.642
The night cry of a child.

01:11:20.884 --> 01:11:22.840
Face on the wall, knockings, bangings.

01:11:22.924 --> 01:11:24.073
What's there to be afraid of?.

01:11:24.164 --> 01:11:27.440
You weren't threatened. It was harmless,
like a joke that didn't come off.

01:11:27.524 --> 01:11:29.276
-But the child--
-There was no child.

01:11:29.364 --> 01:11:30.922
-Just a voice.
-Worse.

01:11:32.244 --> 01:11:34.075
Look, let me put it this way.

01:11:34.884 --> 01:11:37.193
When people believed the Earth was flat...

01:11:37.284 --> 01:11:39.923
the idea of a round world
scared them silly.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:42.564
Then they found out
how the round world works.

01:11:42.644 --> 01:11:45.112
It's the same with the world
of the supernatural.

01:11:45.204 --> 01:11:47.001
Until we know how it works...

01:11:47.484 --> 01:11:51.079
we'll continue to carry around
this unnecessary burden of fear.

01:11:54.564 --> 01:11:57.124
Supposing it is in my imagination...

01:11:57.764 --> 01:12:00.403
the knocking, the voices, everything.

01:12:02.564 --> 01:12:04.600
Every cursed bit of the haunting.

01:12:07.284 --> 01:12:09.593
Suppose the haunting is all in my mind.

01:12:09.684 --> 01:12:12.676
You can't say that
because there are three other people here.

01:12:12.764 --> 01:12:14.994
We all resist the idea...

01:12:15.204 --> 01:12:18.276
that what ran through the garden
the first night was a ghost...

01:12:18.364 --> 01:12:21.959
what banged on the door was a ghost,
what held your hand was a ghost.

01:12:22.084 --> 01:12:24.803
But there's certainly something
going on in Hill House.

01:12:24.884 --> 01:12:28.399
We're getting close, Eleanor,
very close to finding out what it is.

01:12:28.564 --> 01:12:32.000
I could say all three of you
are in my imagination. None of this is real.

01:12:32.084 --> 01:12:34.723
Sure. That's the easiest way to dismiss
the supernatural...

01:12:34.804 --> 01:12:37.477
by pleading insanity
or accusing others of it.

01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:39.077
Maybe l am insane.

01:12:44.364 --> 01:12:46.082
The night my mother died...

01:12:47.044 --> 01:12:48.682
she knocked on the wall.

01:12:49.604 --> 01:12:50.923
And l didn't come.

01:12:53.124 --> 01:12:56.241
Eleven years of looking in on her
after every small noise.

01:12:57.004 --> 01:12:58.198
That night...

01:12:59.484 --> 01:13:01.122
my back hurt and my hands.

01:13:01.684 --> 01:13:04.482
It wasn't fair.
We could've afforded a laundress.

01:13:04.764 --> 01:13:07.995
I ought to have brought her the medicine.
I always did before.

01:13:08.164 --> 01:13:09.313
This time...

01:13:11.204 --> 01:13:12.523
she called me...

01:13:13.404 --> 01:13:14.917
and l never answered.

01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:19.993
-Is that how a normal person acts?
-Yes.

01:13:20.844 --> 01:13:24.723
You were tired and disgusted. 1 1 years!

01:13:25.844 --> 01:13:27.118
You're human.

01:13:27.684 --> 01:13:30.118
Stop trying to be either a saint
or a martyr.

01:13:30.444 --> 01:13:32.912
You probably like thinking
it was your fault.

01:13:33.844 --> 01:13:36.278
My sister says l wanted Mother to die.

01:13:37.844 --> 01:13:40.756
I've wondered ever since
if l didn't wake up in the night...

01:13:40.844 --> 01:13:44.075
and hear her just go back to sleep.

01:13:45.444 --> 01:13:47.082
It would have been easy.

01:13:47.364 --> 01:13:50.720
-I've wondered about it.
-No, you're not capable of that.

01:13:51.804 --> 01:13:53.635
You're a fine person, Eleanor.

01:13:54.204 --> 01:13:56.593
Sensitive and honest and thoroughly good.

01:13:58.724 --> 01:14:01.761
-Do you really think so, John?
-I do indeed.

01:14:05.804 --> 01:14:07.078
Goose bumps.

01:14:08.884 --> 01:14:12.354
There isn't by any chance
a cold spot in this room, too, is there?

01:14:12.684 --> 01:14:14.322
No, there isn't.

01:14:30.724 --> 01:14:32.715
"Journeys end in lovers meeting. "

01:14:34.364 --> 01:14:36.400
All l want is to be cherished.

01:14:37.724 --> 01:14:40.443
And here we are listening
to that ridiculous harp.

01:14:42.924 --> 01:14:45.677
"Lust. Daughter, preserve thyself.

01:14:47.844 --> 01:14:51.678
"Hold apart from this world,
that its lust corrupt thee not.

01:14:52.044 --> 01:14:54.797
"Could you but hear for a moment
the agony...

01:14:55.644 --> 01:14:57.043
"the screaming..."

01:14:58.044 --> 01:14:59.955
Oh, now, get this, congregation.

01:15:00.364 --> 01:15:02.753
"...the dreadful crying out of the lustful...

01:15:02.964 --> 01:15:05.922
"damned for eternity
in everlasting flame! "

01:15:06.764 --> 01:15:09.153
-What have you got there?
-I found it in the library.

01:15:09.244 --> 01:15:10.597
He made it himself.

01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:11.799
Look.

01:15:12.004 --> 01:15:13.801
"Memories for Abigail Lester Crain:

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:16.034
"a legacy for her education
and enlightenment.

01:15:16.124 --> 01:15:18.479
"From her devoted father,
Hugh Desmond Lester Crain...

01:15:18.564 --> 01:15:21.078
"Hill House, October 21, 1873."

01:15:21.804 --> 01:15:25.194
-But that's today.
-Tomorrow and 90 years later.

01:15:25.884 --> 01:15:27.203
Some nursery book, huh?

01:15:28.284 --> 01:15:31.720
"Honor the authors of thy being, daughter.

01:15:31.924 --> 01:15:34.199
"Thy father and thy mother."

01:15:35.484 --> 01:15:38.920
Just the thing to give a child at bedtime.
No family should be without one.

01:15:39.004 --> 01:15:43.043
I can see him now spitting out the words
so they take root in her little mind.

01:15:44.964 --> 01:15:48.115
Hugh Crain, you were a dirty man
and you made a dirty house.

01:15:48.284 --> 01:15:50.752
If you can hear me,
l'm telling you to your face...

01:15:50.844 --> 01:15:53.995
I hope you spend eternity
in that foul, rotten book...

01:15:54.084 --> 01:15:56.200
and never stop burning for a minute.

01:16:00.364 --> 01:16:03.595
-Don't be a bore, Nell. Sit down and we'll--
-Leave me alone.

01:16:04.364 --> 01:16:05.922
You are a bore.

01:16:06.564 --> 01:16:08.316
I've got it. I'll tear out the pictures...

01:16:08.404 --> 01:16:11.601
and send them as Christmas cards
to my New England relatives.

01:16:11.764 --> 01:16:14.722
I think it's funny. "Dear Uncle Ned:
Merry Christmas, may your soul--"

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:16.157
Close that book.

01:16:16.844 --> 01:16:18.596
It's enough to set
anyone's nerves on edge.

01:16:18.684 --> 01:16:21.323
It's not the book
that's making our Nell nervous.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:23.480
She's worried about her apartment.

01:16:24.564 --> 01:16:26.873
I didn't know.
Is there anything l can do to help?

01:16:26.964 --> 01:16:28.636
She thinks she's being funny.

01:16:28.724 --> 01:16:31.079
Tell me, Dr. Markway,
are you fond of stone lions...

01:16:31.164 --> 01:16:34.042
-the kind you keep on the mantel?
-Shut up, Theo.

01:16:34.124 --> 01:16:37.002
Do you long for a tiny home,
something smaller than Hill House?

01:16:37.084 --> 01:16:38.802
There's room for two, isn't there, Nell?

01:16:38.884 --> 01:16:42.957
You're a monster, Theo.
You're the monster of Hill House.

01:16:47.484 --> 01:16:49.714
-You'd better go with her.
-Wouldn't you rather?

01:16:49.804 --> 01:16:53.001
I said go with her.
She shouldn't be left in that room alone.

01:17:00.084 --> 01:17:01.961
Here you are. Okay, lsolde.

01:17:02.044 --> 01:17:04.114
-Tristan wants you inside.
-Leave me alone.

01:17:04.204 --> 01:17:05.922
Stop trying to be the center of attention.

01:17:06.004 --> 01:17:08.040
-Come inside.
-You revolt me.

01:17:09.204 --> 01:17:11.001
Can't you take a joke?

01:17:11.404 --> 01:17:13.281
I didn't know you
were serious about Markway.

01:17:13.364 --> 01:17:14.922
Of course you did.

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:17.634
But he shouldn't be allowed
to get away with it.

01:17:17.724 --> 01:17:19.316
Get away with what?

01:17:19.444 --> 01:17:23.073
-You're making a fool of yourself over him.
-Suppose l'm not, though.

01:17:23.164 --> 01:17:26.122
You'd mind terribly if you turned out
to be wrong for once.

01:17:26.204 --> 01:17:30.163
-You poor stupid innocent.
-I'd rather be innocent than like you.

01:17:31.204 --> 01:17:32.603
Meaning what?

01:17:32.764 --> 01:17:34.959
Now who's being stupid and innocent?

01:17:35.404 --> 01:17:39.158
-You know perfectly well what l mean.
-Is this one of your crazy hallucinations?

01:17:39.244 --> 01:17:41.314
-I'm not crazy.
-Crazy as a loon.

01:17:41.404 --> 01:17:44.521
You expect me to believe you're sane
and the rest of the world is mad?

01:17:44.604 --> 01:17:45.957
Why not?

01:17:46.044 --> 01:17:48.194
The world is full of inconsistencies.

01:17:48.524 --> 01:17:52.676
Unnatural things. "Nature's mistakes,"
they're called. You, for instance.

01:18:09.124 --> 01:18:12.036
A reporter's been telephoning all day.
He's on your track.

01:18:12.124 --> 01:18:14.274
-He's heard about you renting this place.
-How?

01:18:14.364 --> 01:18:16.673
The Dudleys, l bet.
They must've blabbed in town.

01:18:16.764 --> 01:18:18.436
Come back with me now, please.

01:18:18.524 --> 01:18:21.596
If they find out why you're here,
the papers'll have a field day.

01:18:21.684 --> 01:18:23.003
Who are you?

01:18:23.404 --> 01:18:24.519
Grace Markway.

01:18:25.884 --> 01:18:27.920
Didn't John tell you he's married?

01:18:28.404 --> 01:18:30.838
-I tried to warn you.
-Welcome to our party.

01:18:31.444 --> 01:18:33.036
Who are you?

01:18:33.244 --> 01:18:36.042
We're researchers in the field
of psychic phenomena.

01:18:36.124 --> 01:18:38.433
Please go.
You couldn't have arrived at a worse time.

01:18:38.524 --> 01:18:40.833
Stop this insanity, John,
and come back with me.

01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:41.993
I can't. Not now.

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:44.837
I'm convinced
we're on the verge of a breakthrough.

01:18:45.324 --> 01:18:47.474
Here you are, driver, that'll be all.

01:18:48.204 --> 01:18:50.434
But l had to come. I had to.

01:18:51.404 --> 01:18:53.315
I've waited such a long time.

01:18:53.844 --> 01:18:55.721
I've earned my happiness.

01:18:58.124 --> 01:19:00.479
I was afraid this would be your attitude.

01:19:00.884 --> 01:19:04.274
I'm not leaving here until you've got
sense enough to leave with me.

01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:06.798
I hope no one minds
if l join the ghost hunt.

01:19:07.804 --> 01:19:10.238
All right, l'll put your things in my room.

01:19:10.764 --> 01:19:13.278
I'll be very disappointed
if l don't see a ghost.

01:19:13.364 --> 01:19:15.719
Hadn't you better put me
in the ghastly dungeon...

01:19:15.804 --> 01:19:17.874
or the mysterious secret chamber?

01:19:17.964 --> 01:19:20.558
There are no dungeons,
no secret chambers in Hill House.

01:19:20.644 --> 01:19:22.635
In fact, nothing romantic at all.

01:19:23.124 --> 01:19:25.194
It's a deadly serious place.

01:19:25.764 --> 01:19:29.154
-Not even a treasure buried in the cellar?
-There's the nursery.

01:19:30.084 --> 01:19:32.279
Thank you, my dear. The nursery it is.

01:19:42.164 --> 01:19:45.315
You must listen to me.
Certain things have happened here.

01:19:45.604 --> 01:19:48.755
You may not believe in the supernatural,
but these are physical facts.

01:19:48.844 --> 01:19:51.881
Mrs. Markway, please....

01:19:52.524 --> 01:19:54.276
Don't sleep in the nursery.

01:19:54.604 --> 01:19:56.674
I didn't realize what l was saying.

01:19:57.204 --> 01:19:59.035
You insult my intelligence.

01:19:59.164 --> 01:20:03.237
You don't think l'd believe anything
you ghost hunters might tell me.

01:20:03.324 --> 01:20:05.713
Even so, you shouldn't sleep in that room.

01:20:06.244 --> 01:20:08.474
It hasn't been opened
since we've been here.

01:20:08.564 --> 01:20:12.716
I agree with you about the spook bit,
Mrs. M, but it's true, the air might be bad.

01:20:12.844 --> 01:20:14.243
Oh, poisonous.

01:20:14.444 --> 01:20:17.163
I've just remembered. No problem.

01:20:17.244 --> 01:20:21.157
I don't have the key to the nursery,
and the Dudleys have gone for the night.

01:20:21.364 --> 01:20:23.673
Incidentally,
how'd you get through the gate?

01:20:23.764 --> 01:20:26.232
Very supernatural. With a key.

01:20:26.684 --> 01:20:29.118
Your Mrs. Dudley is quite human,
l assure you...

01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:31.274
and not at all averse to a $5 bill.

01:20:33.044 --> 01:20:34.318
Hey, look.

01:20:45.404 --> 01:20:48.953
From your expressions,
l gather that is the dreaded nursery.

01:20:50.244 --> 01:20:52.804
And as for the bad air,
it's quite the opposite.

01:20:52.884 --> 01:20:54.795
There seems to be a draft.

01:20:55.764 --> 01:20:57.163
Wait a minute, Doc.

01:20:58.804 --> 01:21:01.318
This is ridiculous.
Nobody opened these doors.

01:21:01.484 --> 01:21:04.681
That's right, Luke.
You're beginning to see the light.

01:21:04.844 --> 01:21:06.596
I haven't seen a damn thing.

01:21:08.644 --> 01:21:10.714
I just don't like the way it looks.

01:21:12.724 --> 01:21:15.796
Now l know who your fiend
of Hill House is.

01:21:15.884 --> 01:21:17.442
The interior decorator.

01:21:17.564 --> 01:21:20.397
Evidently Mrs. Dudley
doesn't get in here very often.

01:21:20.484 --> 01:21:22.839
Looks the same
as the rest of the house to me.

01:21:22.924 --> 01:21:25.916
It's no use, Grace. The air in here is stale.

01:21:26.164 --> 01:21:28.041
I can take care of that.

01:21:28.364 --> 01:21:31.356
Only one way
to argue with a woman, Doc. Don't.

01:21:32.124 --> 01:21:33.716
Good night.

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:35.958
My mother....

01:21:41.324 --> 01:21:44.361
This room is the cold,
rotten heart of the house.

01:21:44.524 --> 01:21:46.435
Since you're so foolish, l'll stay with you.

01:21:46.524 --> 01:21:48.560
But you're not to be
in this room alone tonight.

01:21:48.644 --> 01:21:52.193
I can't go on watching you waste your life
on all this nonsense.

01:21:52.404 --> 01:21:56.317
If there is such a thing as a haunted house,
this is my chance to find out.

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:57.399
All right.

01:21:59.044 --> 01:22:01.512
John, my bag.

01:22:02.444 --> 01:22:04.241
At least leave the door open.

01:22:04.684 --> 01:22:07.596
Don't worry.
I've brought a special ghost trap with me.

01:22:14.444 --> 01:22:17.800
What if he does have a wife?
l still have a place in this house.

01:22:18.004 --> 01:22:20.996
I belong. I want to stay here.

01:22:21.724 --> 01:22:24.443
It's the only time
anything's ever happened to me.

01:22:24.964 --> 01:22:28.673
He can't make me leave,
not if Hill House means me to stay.

01:22:29.484 --> 01:22:33.955
Go away, Eleanor, we don't want you
anymore, you can't stay.

01:22:35.484 --> 01:22:37.361
But l can.

01:22:37.964 --> 01:22:40.159
He doesn't make the rules around here.

01:22:42.364 --> 01:22:43.763
Nell, l'm talking to you.

01:22:44.684 --> 01:22:46.037
-I'm sorry.
-What's the matter?

01:22:46.124 --> 01:22:47.716
Didn't you hear Markway?

01:22:48.524 --> 01:22:49.957
He doesn't want us to stay here.

01:22:50.044 --> 01:22:52.478
He wants us to spend the night
downstairs in the parlor.

01:22:52.564 --> 01:22:55.397
Luke and he will take turns
watching on this floor.

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:58.759
For Pete's sake, snap out of it.

01:24:33.964 --> 01:24:36.398
-Why aren't you upstairs?
-I needed a drink.

01:25:00.964 --> 01:25:02.158
-Grace.
-Wait a minute.

01:25:08.884 --> 01:25:11.398
It's nowhere near the nursery,
it's down here.

01:25:22.044 --> 01:25:24.558
It seems to me
we've been on this kick before.

01:25:24.844 --> 01:25:27.404
Next vacation
l must really go somewhere else.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:46.035
It knows my name.
This time it knows my name.

01:25:47.204 --> 01:25:49.115
-I'll have to go out there.
-No!

01:25:50.564 --> 01:25:54.876
-It hasn't hurt me. Why should it hurt her?
-She might try to do something about it.

01:25:59.084 --> 01:26:00.756
Is it over, Theo? ls it?

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:03.794
No, l'm so cold.

01:26:04.524 --> 01:26:07.038
It's going to start everything
all over again.

01:26:14.324 --> 01:26:16.918
It can't get in. Don't let it get in.

01:26:39.964 --> 01:26:41.682
Oh, God, it knows l'm here.

01:27:09.244 --> 01:27:11.519
Doc, l'll let you have the house cheap.

01:27:47.684 --> 01:27:51.233
It will go on and on
and come back again until it finds me.

01:27:52.244 --> 01:27:55.600
On and on until it finds me.

01:28:06.564 --> 01:28:07.997
It's at the nursery.

01:28:08.564 --> 01:28:10.282
-You must be crazy!
-I'm going out there!

01:28:10.364 --> 01:28:11.877
Not with that thing out there.

01:28:11.964 --> 01:28:14.762
-We have to, Luke. She's there!
-Don't be crazy.

01:28:14.844 --> 01:28:16.880
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.

01:28:16.964 --> 01:28:19.273
I don't know what it is,
but l don't want to find out--

01:28:19.364 --> 01:28:22.640
I've got to get out of here.
I've got to find out if Grace is all right.

01:28:22.724 --> 01:28:24.157
-No, don't.
-Cut it out!

01:28:24.244 --> 01:28:26.474
I'll come.

01:28:27.804 --> 01:28:29.999
Whatever it wants of me it can have.

01:29:35.124 --> 01:29:37.274
The house is coming down around me.

01:29:37.764 --> 01:29:40.232
The house is destroying itself.

01:29:57.964 --> 01:29:59.363
It's in the nursery.

01:30:23.604 --> 01:30:24.878
Mrs. Markway?

01:30:27.484 --> 01:30:28.439
Please.

01:30:33.684 --> 01:30:35.640
Grace, are you....

01:30:36.724 --> 01:30:38.043
Where is she?

01:30:39.364 --> 01:30:42.037
-Where is she? What did you see?
-Nothing.

01:30:43.684 --> 01:30:44.958
She wasn't here.

01:30:46.164 --> 01:30:47.438
-What happened?
-She's gone.

01:30:47.524 --> 01:30:48.957
Where? How?

01:30:49.124 --> 01:30:50.159
Good God!

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.235
Markway, if this is your idea of a joke...

01:30:52.324 --> 01:30:54.838
if living in a haunted house
has done this to you--

01:30:54.924 --> 01:30:56.437
We'll start here, then the whole house.

01:30:56.524 --> 01:30:59.482
-Even if we have to tear the place apart.
-You can't do that.

01:30:59.564 --> 01:31:02.317
If we don't find her,
the police will be around.

01:31:02.404 --> 01:31:05.077
I'm coming apart, a little at a time.

01:31:09.204 --> 01:31:11.274
Now l know where l'm going.

01:31:11.764 --> 01:31:15.552
I'm disappearing inch by inch
into this house.

01:31:22.484 --> 01:31:25.840
We killed her. You and l, Hugh Crain.

01:31:59.444 --> 01:32:01.719
She must be around this house
somewhere.

01:32:02.724 --> 01:32:04.521
Maybe this whole thing is a bad joke.

01:32:04.604 --> 01:32:07.880
-She isn't the kind who makes jokes.
-You find her, she's your wife.

01:32:07.964 --> 01:32:10.398
I'm taking Nell
and l'm clearing out of here.

01:32:10.644 --> 01:32:12.236
Where is Eleanor?

01:32:25.204 --> 01:32:26.637
I want to stay here.

01:32:28.004 --> 01:32:29.995
I want to stay here always.

01:32:33.524 --> 01:32:35.958
I will not be frightened or alone anymore.

01:32:44.004 --> 01:32:45.835
Has anyone checked outside?

01:32:47.764 --> 01:32:49.834
Please, Nell, where are you?

01:32:58.324 --> 01:33:01.043
Here l am, inside.

01:33:01.724 --> 01:33:05.319
It's not cold at all and the smell is gone.

01:33:33.324 --> 01:33:35.519
I've broken the spell of Hill House.

01:33:36.404 --> 01:33:37.519
I'm home.

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:47.923
No stone lions for me. I am home.

01:35:21.284 --> 01:35:22.399
I will not look back...

01:35:22.484 --> 01:35:25.078
because then they will know
what l am thinking.

01:35:25.364 --> 01:35:27.514
Eleanor, turn around and come down.

01:35:35.244 --> 01:35:36.723
Now, be very, very careful.

01:35:39.004 --> 01:35:40.437
Come down.

01:35:45.964 --> 01:35:48.273
All that is gone and left behind.

01:35:49.484 --> 01:35:51.122
Eleanor, for God's sake!

01:36:00.244 --> 01:36:04.522
-Wait a minute. This thing will collapse--
-It can't possibly hold the both of you.

01:36:16.444 --> 01:36:18.082
Just turn around, Eleanor.

01:36:18.684 --> 01:36:21.198
Keep hold of the rail
and start down slowly.

01:36:52.204 --> 01:36:53.842
Stand still! Don't move!

01:36:56.124 --> 01:36:57.637
Stand perfectly still!

01:36:58.044 --> 01:37:00.000
Nell, do what they say, please!

01:37:36.524 --> 01:37:38.355
I'm coming on the platform.

01:38:23.324 --> 01:38:24.803
Now come along.

01:38:47.524 --> 01:38:49.321
Are you sure, Eleanor?

01:38:49.964 --> 01:38:51.477
It was Mrs. Markway.

01:38:52.164 --> 01:38:55.679
Just before l fainted, l looked up,
and there she was above the trap door.

01:38:55.764 --> 01:38:57.959
What's more, she's still around.

01:38:58.484 --> 01:39:01.044
I don't know
who or what you really saw, Eleanor.

01:39:01.124 --> 01:39:03.718
But whatever it was,
we can't risk letting it happen again.

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:06.364
-That's why you're leaving now.
-But l can't leave now.

01:39:06.444 --> 01:39:10.198
-I brought the car round front. She ready?
-She's all packed. Take her suitcase.

01:39:10.284 --> 01:39:12.639
No, please, Luke, let me stay.

01:39:12.724 --> 01:39:14.396
I'll help Mrs. Dudley.

01:39:14.684 --> 01:39:16.834
All it will cost you is just my keep.

01:39:17.044 --> 01:39:19.433
Sorry, honey,
but you're not the type l keep.

01:39:19.524 --> 01:39:22.914
-I can't leave, l tell you.
-I can't take any more chances.

01:39:23.364 --> 01:39:26.197
I realize now what a terrible thing
l was asking of you all.

01:39:26.284 --> 01:39:30.072
You're leaving as quickly as you can.
Then we'll find Grace or go to the police.

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:31.358
It isn't fair.

01:39:31.444 --> 01:39:34.322
I'm the one who's supposed to stay here.
She's taken my place.

01:39:34.404 --> 01:39:36.395
Don't worry.
Luke will see you get there safely.

01:39:36.484 --> 01:39:39.078
-Get where?
-Why, home, of course.

01:39:39.164 --> 01:39:42.281
Go back to your own little apartment
where all your things are.

01:39:42.364 --> 01:39:43.843
I haven't any home.

01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:45.393
I made it up.

01:39:46.204 --> 01:39:47.956
No apartment, no things....

01:39:48.924 --> 01:39:50.994
Everything in all the world
that belongs to me...

01:39:51.084 --> 01:39:53.644
is in that suitcase and a carton in my car.

01:39:54.724 --> 01:39:57.557
So you see,
there's no place you can send me.

01:39:58.084 --> 01:39:59.517
I have to stay here.

01:39:59.684 --> 01:40:01.720
You must have lived somewhere before.

01:40:01.804 --> 01:40:04.557
-You had an address where l wrote you.
-My sister's.

01:40:05.244 --> 01:40:07.519
I sleep on a couch in the living room.

01:40:07.764 --> 01:40:10.597
I'd be much happier here.
I can't go back to my sister's.

01:40:10.684 --> 01:40:12.754
Yes, you can, and immediately.

01:40:14.044 --> 01:40:17.559
This is a mistake. Don't you understand?
The house wants me.

01:40:17.924 --> 01:40:20.279
Mrs. Markway can't satisfy it.
No one else can.

01:40:20.364 --> 01:40:22.082
Forget about this house
as soon as you can.

01:40:22.164 --> 01:40:25.759
No, please. I'm fine now. I'm not afraid.

01:40:27.484 --> 01:40:28.758
I was happy here.

01:40:29.804 --> 01:40:32.955
-I don't think Mrs. Markway will be.
-Put the bag in the car, Luke.

01:40:33.044 --> 01:40:35.080
Nell is right. Grace is around somewhere.

01:40:35.164 --> 01:40:37.553
-You see?
-Please, there's no time to waste.

01:40:37.724 --> 01:40:41.080
Please, let me stay. I'm the only one
who can call Mrs. Markway back.

01:40:41.164 --> 01:40:44.156
I was wrong. I should have sent
you home the first night.

01:40:47.204 --> 01:40:50.037
This is the only time
anything's ever happened to me.

01:40:55.324 --> 01:40:57.280
I'm the one it really wants.

01:40:59.004 --> 01:41:02.360
Can't you feel it? lt's alive.

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:04.877
Watching...

01:41:05.724 --> 01:41:06.998
waiting....

01:41:10.884 --> 01:41:12.442
Waiting for me.

01:41:17.724 --> 01:41:19.237
I won't go away.

01:41:19.564 --> 01:41:21.555
You will go away. Right now.

01:41:24.804 --> 01:41:27.193
-No, come on.
-I'll drive. It's my car.

01:41:28.244 --> 01:41:29.882
At least, half mine.

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:32.878
All right, let her.
I can't stand here arguing.

01:41:33.284 --> 01:41:35.639
Thank you for rescuing me in the library.

01:41:37.204 --> 01:41:40.435
That was wrong of me, l know,
but l'm all right now, honestly.

01:41:40.524 --> 01:41:43.561
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry, really.

01:41:47.484 --> 01:41:48.473
Goodbye.

01:41:48.844 --> 01:41:50.402
Let's get moving.

01:41:57.964 --> 01:42:00.159
I thought you weren't going
to say goodbye.

01:42:00.244 --> 01:42:02.917
Nellie my Nell, be happy, please be happy.

01:42:03.484 --> 01:42:05.281
Everything's going to be all right.

01:42:05.364 --> 01:42:08.117
I'm sure Grace is here and we'll find her.
So don't worry.

01:42:08.204 --> 01:42:10.434
She has my place. It isn't fair.

01:42:10.844 --> 01:42:12.516
Goodbye, Eleanor.

01:42:16.164 --> 01:42:19.042
I'll write you. Drive carefully.

01:42:22.524 --> 01:42:24.082
Goodbye.

01:42:27.804 --> 01:42:29.760
Who do l thank for a lovely time?

01:42:34.124 --> 01:42:35.796
Oh, hold it. Markway!

01:42:39.404 --> 01:42:40.359
The key.

01:42:41.324 --> 01:42:43.838
-To the gate.
-Yes, of course.

01:42:44.964 --> 01:42:48.354
What fools they are.
The house tricks them so easily.

01:42:48.964 --> 01:42:52.115
Just by telling me to go away,
they can't make me leave.

01:42:52.924 --> 01:42:54.676
They can't shut me out.

01:42:55.004 --> 01:42:57.234
Not if Hill House means me to stay.

01:42:58.444 --> 01:43:00.036
-Eleanor.
-Wait.

01:43:10.804 --> 01:43:12.442
So now l'm going.

01:43:13.084 --> 01:43:16.474
But l won't go. Hill House belongs to me.

01:43:19.524 --> 01:43:21.594
I knew it.

01:43:22.044 --> 01:43:24.080
Hill House doesn't want me to go.

01:43:30.844 --> 01:43:33.074
Stop it. Please. What are you doing?

01:43:33.564 --> 01:43:34.917
Let go.

01:43:36.724 --> 01:43:38.123
What are you doing?

01:43:40.124 --> 01:43:43.161
Why don't they stop me?
Can't they see what is happening?

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:46.793
But it's happening to you, Eleanor.

01:43:47.404 --> 01:43:50.840
Yes. Something at last is really...

01:43:53.324 --> 01:43:55.440
really happening to me.

01:44:27.764 --> 01:44:29.083
She's dead.

01:44:42.324 --> 01:44:45.634
I didn't want any of this to happen.
You must believe me, John.

01:44:46.084 --> 01:44:48.154
What were you doing? What happened?

01:44:48.644 --> 01:44:50.077
That terrible house.

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:54.643
I woke up and l was frightened.
So l tried to find your room, but l got lost.

01:44:54.724 --> 01:44:57.443
Almost as though
the house were doing it on purpose.

01:44:57.524 --> 01:44:59.196
And l ended up in the attic.

01:44:59.284 --> 01:45:02.242
I was only trying to find a way out
when l opened the trap door.

01:45:02.324 --> 01:45:04.315
I wasn't trying to frighten her.

01:45:04.404 --> 01:45:07.714
-Didn't you see me?
-No, but Eleanor did.

01:45:08.284 --> 01:45:10.320
The shock of seeing you almost killed her.

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:11.473
She did kill her.

01:45:12.604 --> 01:45:15.198
Seeing her is what made Eleanor
lose control of the car.

01:45:15.284 --> 01:45:18.754
No. She only saw me the very last instant.

01:45:18.844 --> 01:45:20.960
The same time l saw her.

01:45:21.604 --> 01:45:23.754
I don't even know how l got out here.

01:45:24.244 --> 01:45:25.723
It wasn't your fault.

01:45:26.804 --> 01:45:28.476
Eleanor did it to herself.

01:45:29.204 --> 01:45:31.160
It looked to me, anyway, like she...

01:45:31.244 --> 01:45:33.599
deliberately aimed the car at this tree.

01:45:34.724 --> 01:45:38.353
Where the first Mrs. Crain
was also killed in an "accident."

01:45:40.164 --> 01:45:41.438
Here's the mark.

01:45:44.164 --> 01:45:46.883
There was something in the car with her,
l'm sure of it.

01:45:46.964 --> 01:45:49.762
Call it what you like,
but Hill House is haunted.

01:45:50.764 --> 01:45:53.597
It didn't want her to leave,
and her poor bedeviled mind...

01:45:53.684 --> 01:45:55.675
wasn't strong enough to fight it.

01:45:57.204 --> 01:45:59.764
-Poor Eleanor.
-Maybe not "poor" Eleanor.

01:46:01.324 --> 01:46:03.884
It was what she wanted, to stay here.

01:46:05.244 --> 01:46:07.041
She had no place else to go.

01:46:08.724 --> 01:46:11.158
The house belongs to her now, too.

01:46:11.684 --> 01:46:13.117
Maybe she's happier.

01:46:13.804 --> 01:46:15.362
You wait here, Grace.

01:46:15.444 --> 01:46:17.912
I'll go and get your things
and call the police.

01:46:18.004 --> 01:46:20.802
No one must go in that house again.
Whatever is there might--

01:46:20.884 --> 01:46:22.237
I'll be all right.

01:46:23.004 --> 01:46:26.792
The house has what it wants...for a while.

01:46:34.644 --> 01:46:38.478
It ought to be burned down
and the ground sowed with salt.

01:46:44.004 --> 01:46:48.316
Hill House has stood for 90 years
and might stand for 90 more.

01:46:49.244 --> 01:46:53.317
Within, walls continue upright,
bricks meet...

01:46:53.924 --> 01:46:57.758
floors are firm,
and doors are sensibly shut.

01:46:58.724 --> 01:47:02.399
Silence lies steadily against the wood
and stone of Hill House.

01:47:02.764 --> 01:47:06.552
And we who walk here walk alone.
