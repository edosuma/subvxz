WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:01.998
Three, two, one... 

00:02.179 --> 00:05.688
If you're just joining us today, on "Dear Mom",

00:05.689 --> 00:09.126
we're talking about the big C. Commitment.

00:09.263 --> 00:12.257
And our next caller is Janey from Irvine.

00:12.258 --> 00:15.152
Good morning, Janey.
So what's on your mind?

00:15.153 --> 00:17.087
Hi, Nora. I love your show.

00:17.126 --> 00:21.573
Thank you. Um, okay, so, Janey, what's up?

00:21.582 --> 00:23.105
How do I know if my boyfriend Doug

00:23.106 --> 00:25.329
is truly committed to our relationship?

00:26.365 --> 00:28.510
I don't know. Why are you asking me?

00:28.642 --> 00:31.350
You have to hang up the
phone, call Doug, and ask him.

00:31.351 --> 00:33.382
I don't know if I want to hear the answer.

00:33.383 --> 00:37.077
You can't waste your life
waiting for someone to commit.

00:37.558 --> 00:39.315
But you... but you can't
give up hope either.

00:39.316 --> 00:41.953
Sometimes there's hope
where you least expect it.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.889
Take my middle son for instance.

00:44.890 --> 00:49.146
Now he was the child I thought
least likely to commit, ever.

00:50.069 --> 00:51.860
And now he and his husband

00:51.861 --> 00:54.289
have been happily married
for over three years.

00:54.297 --> 00:55.305
And honestly... 

00:56.074 --> 00:58.568
they have one of the
best marriages I know.

00:59.177 --> 01:00.409
So there you have it.

01:07.764 --> 01:10.112
Oh, I... I thought you
might want an espresso.

01:10.113 --> 01:12.193
I didn't realize you were still sleeping.

01:13.025 --> 01:14.657
I wouldn't call it sleeping.

01:15.929 --> 01:19.042
More like barely achieving
a semi-unconscious state.

01:19.550 --> 01:21.919
Th-there's regular coffee,
if you want that, too.

01:22.265 --> 01:23.609
Was there something else?

01:25.024 --> 01:25.808
Uh, yeah.

01:25.809 --> 01:27.025
Actually, I wanted to... 

01:27.834 --> 01:29.577
to talk about the party tonight.

01:29.986 --> 01:30.788
I don't want to ruin it for you,

01:30.789 --> 01:33.973
so I thought maybe I... 
I shouldn't be there.

01:34.789 --> 01:36.438
It's a charity event.

01:36.625 --> 01:38.795
People have paid 150 bucks per head

01:38.796 --> 01:42.635
to be served your signature
hors d'oeuvres by you,

01:42.666 --> 01:43.786
and that's what they're gonna get.

01:43.787 --> 01:47.289
Oh, G... this thing is
like a concrete slab.

01:48.821 --> 01:50.764
Kevin, I know how upset you are... 

01:50.765 --> 01:52.701
Yeah, it's kind of an appropriate reaction

01:52.702 --> 01:54.739
when you find out your
husband was with someone else,

01:54.740 --> 01:55.732
don't you think?

01:58.665 --> 01:59.652
You finished upstairs?

01:59.653 --> 02:01.862
Because I'd like to take
a shower now, please.

02:03.186 --> 02:05.093
Yeah, I'm all done. The
bathroom's all yours.

02:05.094 --> 02:05.940
Good.

02:19.685 --> 02:20.964
Oh, my God.

02:20.965 --> 02:21.745
Hey, babe.

02:21.746 --> 02:22.770
Hello.

02:23.238 --> 02:26.022
I thought your plane
wasn't getting in till noon.

02:26.518 --> 02:28.774
How was the gallery?
Did they like your work?

02:29.902 --> 02:31.520
Keeping my fingers crossed.

02:31.521 --> 02:32.736
Oh, me, too.

02:34.438 --> 02:36.405
Why aren't you wearing
your engagement ring?

02:36.676 --> 02:39.782
Oh, that is a strange tale.

02:40.258 --> 02:41.713
You still haven't told anybody?

02:41.714 --> 02:44.756
No, I just had to tell
Cooper and Paige first.

02:44.757 --> 02:48.326
And I was waiting for
the right time, and... 

02:48.425 --> 02:49.720
And?

02:49.922 --> 02:53.794
And it didn't really
go the way we planned.

02:53.913 --> 02:55.213
They weren't upset, were they?

02:55.214 --> 02:57.765
No. No, it's just that Cooper asked me

02:57.766 --> 03:01.035
how long we were going to be married for.

03:01.036 --> 03:01.685
How long?

03:01.686 --> 03:04.438
Mm-hmm. And he was not being sarcastic.

03:05.381 --> 03:05.701
I'm sorry, Sarah.

03:05.702 --> 03:09.829
So I explained that we were
gonna be married forever.

03:09.830 --> 03:11.702
And he said, "no one's
ever married forever.

03:11.717 --> 03:13.045
Look at you and dad."

03:14.612 --> 03:15.931
I'm sorry, babe. That's horrible.

03:15.932 --> 03:18.283
I know. I can't believe that

03:18.284 --> 03:20.540
that is the example I've set for my son.

03:21.753 --> 03:23.397
You know what? We'll prove him wrong.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.632
We will show Cooper
that a marriage can last.

03:27.390 --> 03:29.449
Look, I'll talk to him when
he gets back from Joe's.

03:29.450 --> 03:31.128
You know, I think that's a good idea.

03:31.129 --> 03:33.721
- He believes everything that you say.
- So should you.

03:33.997 --> 03:35.949
This is why you're going
to wear that ring tonight,

03:35.950 --> 03:37.165
for everyone to see.

03:56.448 --> 03:57.250
Oh.

03:57.251 --> 03:58.146
Mm.

03:58.930 --> 04:00.050
Where are you going?

04:00.145 --> 04:01.793
I'm gonna take a yoga class.

04:02.907 --> 04:03.882
Why?

04:04.201 --> 04:06.979
- I'm a morning person. You know that.
- Mm.

04:08.323 --> 04:09.587
So... 

04:10.294 --> 04:11.753
spend it with me.

04:11.754 --> 04:12.759
Oh, I would love to,

04:12.760 --> 04:15.050
but I actually have appointments today.

04:15.677 --> 04:16.993
I thought the point of you

04:17.000 --> 04:18.579
was that you don't have appointments

04:18.581 --> 04:20.144
and that you go with the flow.

04:20.144 --> 04:24.066
Well, the flow has brought
me back to L.A. and to you.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.955
I'm actually seeing some
people about a position today.

04:32.952 --> 04:34.892
As in downward dog

04:34.893 --> 04:37.236
or a job?

04:37.237 --> 04:40.761
A job. It's a small
investment banking firm.

04:40.762 --> 04:42.714
Investment banking?

04:42.843 --> 04:43.426
Wait a minute.

04:43.429 --> 04:48.325
I thought you and L.A. and corporate
America... didn't get along.

04:48.326 --> 04:51.628
Yeah. I know, but it
feels different this time.

04:51.629 --> 04:54.421
Why? I'm telling you, it's not different.

04:54.422 --> 04:55.689
It's the same crazy,

04:55.690 --> 04:58.176
car-jammed L.A. that it's always been.

04:58.177 --> 04:58.978
You're here.

05:03.030 --> 05:06.406
Well, don't go back into
the rat race because of me.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.661
No. This firm is about new ideas.

05:09.321 --> 05:10.661
I love change, Kitty.

05:10.662 --> 05:13.174
Otherwise I wouldn't have moved
to Ojai in the first place.

05:13.318 --> 05:14.166
Wow.

05:15.496 --> 05:19.357
You're... really thinking
about staying, aren't you?

05:20.801 --> 05:21.600
Yeah.

05:22.169 --> 05:23.048
I am.

05:26.557 --> 05:27.713
God! You have to be iron man

05:27.714 --> 05:29.653
- to get these things off.
- Kevin, let me help.

05:29.654 --> 05:31.336
- I can manage.
- You're sleep deprived.

05:31.337 --> 05:33.386
Why don't you let me sleep on the couch?

05:34.261 --> 05:35.990
Because I don't want to sleep in our bed.

05:37.565 --> 05:39.428
I told you, nothing happened in our bed.

05:39.429 --> 05:40.407
Yeah, and I've told you,

05:40.408 --> 05:41.700
I don't want to know any details.

05:41.701 --> 05:43.629
Fine, but we're both still living here,

05:43.630 --> 05:45.005
and your whole family
is coming here tonight,

05:45.006 --> 05:48.069
and we can't just keep walking
around like nothing's wrong.

05:48.070 --> 05:50.537
I don't want my family to
know because it's humiliating.

05:50.746 --> 05:52.931
- Sometimes I wish I never told you.
- Then why did you?

05:52.932 --> 05:54.984
Because I made a mistake,
Kevin, and the worst thing I did

05:54.985 --> 05:56.995
was try to pretend like it never happened.

05:56.996 --> 05:59.292
I love you, and I know
I owed you the truth.

05:59.293 --> 06:00.828
No, what you owed me was fidelity.

06:00.829 --> 06:01.405
Hey!

06:01.406 --> 06:03.068
Oh, God. I need a coffee.

06:05.442 --> 06:06.577
Are you two fighting?

06:06.809 --> 06:07.553
- No.
- No.

06:07.554 --> 06:10.753
Good. Okay, come on. Let's go
through the details for tonight.

06:10.754 --> 06:13.678
- Mom should be here any moment.
- Wait. N... nora's coming here now?

06:13.733 --> 06:15.604
Well, I hope so. It's her charity.

06:15.605 --> 06:16.893
You think I'm super excited

06:16.894 --> 06:19.392
about the Grace Hill historical trust?

06:20.421 --> 06:21.300
What's this?

06:22.145 --> 06:23.848
Why can't I have a latte?

06:23.849 --> 06:25.770
Uh, the machine's broken.
I gotta go shopping.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.606
You know what? I need a pad and pen.

06:30.687 --> 06:32.783
Wait, Sarah, um, d... 

06:33.570 --> 06:35.409
- Kevin.
- Yeah.

06:35.410 --> 06:37.441
Why are there sheets on your couch?

06:37.702 --> 06:39.591
- Uh, we had a house-guest.
- Oh, yeah?

06:39.592 --> 06:40.392
- Yeah.
- Who?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.005
Barbara.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.688
Barbara? Barbara who?

06:44.689 --> 06:45.329
You don't know her.

06:45.330 --> 06:48.241
Yeah, well, tell her she
left your shoes, socks, tie,

06:48.309 --> 06:49.781
and shirt on the floor.

06:51.553 --> 06:53.658
What's going on? Is Scotty mad at you?

06:53.659 --> 06:54.781
Whoo-hoo. Hi.

06:54.782 --> 06:58.534
Here you are. Here. Oh. Thank
you so much for coming here.

06:58.790 --> 07:03.749
- Kevin, did you listen to
my show this morning?
- No, sorry.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.849
Well, I mentioned you and Scotty.

07:05.850 --> 07:09.098
I used you as an example
of a great marriage.

07:09.798 --> 07:11.916
Ooh, I don't know how great it is, mom.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.190
Kevin slept in his office last night.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.586
Oh. What, does Scotty snore?

07:17.118 --> 07:19.278
No, I was just, uh, I was
too tired to make it upstairs.

07:19.279 --> 07:20.440
- No big deal.
- Oh, yeah?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.880
- Yeah.
- So why the big story about Barbara?

07:22.881 --> 07:24.289
- Who's Barbara?
- Never mind.

07:24.676 --> 07:25.796
- Hey.
- Hi, Nora.

07:28.385 --> 07:29.072
Is everything okay?

07:29.073 --> 07:31.709
Come on, Scotty, tell us.
Why is Kevin in the dog house?

07:31.710 --> 07:32.424
I'm not in the dog house?

07:32.425 --> 07:35.410
- Oh, Kevin, what did you do?
- Come on.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.465
Don't cover for him. Spill the beans.

07:37.466 --> 07:38.413
Why do you assume it's me?

07:38.414 --> 07:39.558
Maybe I'm down here for my own reasons.

07:39.559 --> 07:42.513
Really, what could
Scotty have possibly done?

07:42.514 --> 07:44.514
He cheated. That's what he did.

07:46.149 --> 07:47.990
So much for your great marriage.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.017
I have to get ready for
court. Have a good party.

08:10.586 --> 08:11.964
Sarah, for God sakes,

08:11.965 --> 08:13.073
it's not even noon yet.

08:13.074 --> 08:15.810
Who cares, mom? We're
in the Twilight Zone now.

08:16.465 --> 08:18.816
Besides, it's rosée. Let's call it brunch.

08:18.817 --> 08:20.146
Fine. Pour me one.

08:23.310 --> 08:24.462
Hey. Hey.

08:24.463 --> 08:24.918
- Hi.
- Hi, mom.

08:25.058 --> 08:28.275
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, Scotty asked me to bartend tonight.

08:28.379 --> 08:30.651
Oh, a-are you okay with that?

08:31.357 --> 08:33.440
I used to do it all the
time. And I'm sober now,

08:33.441 --> 08:35.486
- so don't worry about me.
- Good.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.831
I'd worry about yourselves, if anyone.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.576
So, uh, where's Scotty? He's
gotta walk me through the setup.

08:43.311 --> 08:44.238
Yeah.

08:44.337 --> 08:47.192
Look, um, we have a situation there.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.482
It seems... it seems that Scotty... 

08:49.483 --> 08:51.052
- Cheated on Kevin.
- Cheated on Kevin.

08:51.053 --> 08:52.553
- What, liked hooked up?
- Yeah.

08:52.554 --> 08:54.358
I don't know. Oh, no, no,
no. No, I don't believe it.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.644
- It's hard to believe.
- No, mom, I actually don't believe it.

08:56.645 --> 09:01.009
Oh, believe it. It happens... 
dad, remember Joe, my ex-husband?

09:01.010 --> 09:04.909
- Oh, come on, Sarah. Stop it.
That's an unfair comparison.
- Is it?

09:04.910 --> 09:05.308
- Yes.
- Why?

09:05.309 --> 09:06.922
- Because Scotty's a better person.
- Is he?

09:07.119 --> 09:08.889
- Absolute...
- Yes. He is, and you
were fighting with Joe

09:08.890 --> 09:09.943
long before anything ever

09:09.944 --> 09:10.485
- happened with...
- You were fighting long before...

09:10.486 --> 09:12.593
Yeah, but I believed in
our marriage, and I thought

09:12.594 --> 09:14.912
- he was the last man on
this planet that would go...
- Okay, stop.

09:14.913 --> 09:17.228
- You know what? Listen,
Sarah, I get it. Dudes cheat.
- Yeah.

09:17.229 --> 09:19.606
- All right? But Scotty's not that dude.
- No.

09:19.607 --> 09:22.438
We all know that, right? There
has to be some explanation.

09:22.439 --> 09:24.728
Well, the only one I
can come up with is that

09:24.729 --> 09:27.244
when it comes to marriage,
maybe love's not enough.

09:27.245 --> 09:28.393
- Maybe you just never know...
- Oh, Sarah...

09:28.394 --> 09:31.692
Sarah, stop it. Don't talk
like that. Don't talk like that.

09:31.693 --> 09:34.413
- We have absolutely no idea what happened.
- Exactly.

09:34.414 --> 09:35.803
Rebecca and I used to fight all the time

09:35.804 --> 09:38.653
- over misunderstandings...
- Yes, yes, yes...

09:38.654 --> 09:39.432
- And now you're divorced.
- What is your point?

09:39.433 --> 09:40.283
- All right, that's...
- Come on, really? Now just stop it.

09:40.509 --> 09:42.211
- You know, stop. This can't happen.
- Really, what is your point?

09:42.347 --> 09:44.322
Okay? This can't happen.
They're gonna get over it.

09:44.337 --> 09:46.410
- That's all. They're gonna get over it.
- Where are you going?

09:46.411 --> 09:49.705
I'm gonna find Kevin.
You and Joe got divorced.

09:49.785 --> 09:52.524
Rebecca and Justin got
divorced, Tommy and Julia... 

09:52.525 --> 09:54.429
I probably should've gotten divorced.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.601
But Kevin and Scotty? No. They
are the one Walker marriage

09:58.602 --> 10:00.318
which is not going down in flames.

10:02.465 --> 10:04.397
Why don't you come over
to my place tonight,

10:04.398 --> 10:05.513
and... and we can make sundaes?

10:05.514 --> 10:07.200
No. You have to go to this thing.

10:07.201 --> 10:09.500
It's for charity. You're one of the draws.

10:09.501 --> 10:12.029
Oh, please, Kevin. I don't
want to be a draw anymore.

10:12.074 --> 10:13.916
I am just Kitty Walker now.

10:14.316 --> 10:16.382
Look, we can have a slumber party,

10:16.383 --> 10:18.029
just like we used to in the old days.

10:18.030 --> 10:20.712
And... and I'll tell Jack
that tonight is canceled.

10:20.713 --> 10:22.149
Doesn't he, like, live with you now?

10:22.150 --> 10:24.996
No. No, he's staying
with me intermittently.

10:24.997 --> 10:27.078
And it... it might change. I... 

10:28.569 --> 10:30.174
you don't want to hear
about this right now.

10:30.310 --> 10:32.676
What, your new and exciting
love life? No, I don't.

10:32.677 --> 10:36.325
Oh, Kev. Listen, you know, Robert and I... 

10:36.866 --> 10:39.324
Ugh. We made so many mistakes. Okay?

10:39.325 --> 10:40.638
And we got through it.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.880
And when you're ready to talk
calmly, you and Scotty can sit... 

10:43.881 --> 10:46.361
What do you want me to
do, Kit, just forgive him?

10:46.901 --> 10:47.606
Why... 

10:49.437 --> 10:51.758
Oh, of course you do.
You did the same thing.

10:52.550 --> 10:54.571
No, you had an affair with
that guy from the park.

10:54.572 --> 10:56.249
No, nothing happened between me and Alec.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.420
You kissed him, Kitty,
and even if you hadn't,

10:58.421 --> 11:01.208
- you had an emotionally
intimate relationship...
- Kevin, Kevin...

11:01.209 --> 11:02.736
- That you withheld from your husband.
- I am not condoning cheating.

11:02.737 --> 11:04.611
No, you're excusing it. You know what?

11:04.612 --> 11:07.013
I am gonna go tonight
because I live there.

11:07.227 --> 11:10.649
It's where my office is.
Get Scotty over for sundaes.

11:14.894 --> 11:15.725
Hi.

11:21.705 --> 11:22.736
So I guess you know.

11:22.737 --> 11:24.274
Yep, I spoke to Nora.

11:26.246 --> 11:28.101
I have to make a change
in the menu tonight.

11:28.410 --> 11:31.650
- Um, okay. What are you thinking?
- Well, the mushrooms are wilted,

11:31.651 --> 11:33.582
so we can't do the mushrooms bÃ©chamel.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.413
I'll make ricotta fritters instead.

11:37.159 --> 11:38.328
Okay. Can I help?

11:39.441 --> 11:40.950
No. No, you don't need
to be involved in this.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.329
Saul, please don't do this.
You can't just ignore me.

11:43.330 --> 11:46.568
Well, Scotty, I'm at a
loss. How could you do this?

11:46.569 --> 11:48.120
It's not like I planned it.

11:49.021 --> 11:50.616
Things between Kevin and
me were terrible back then.

11:50.617 --> 11:52.096
Really? How terrible could they have been?

11:52.097 --> 11:53.492
It was two months after the accident.

11:53.493 --> 11:56.597
Robert was in a coma.
Michelle had just miscarried.

11:57.126 --> 11:58.550
That terrible, okay?

12:02.145 --> 12:03.633
It was the opening
night of the restaurant.

12:03.926 --> 12:05.749
Yeah, I need 4 pounds of crab meat.

12:06.486 --> 12:08.548
- Okay, good. Call me back. Bye.
- Oh!

12:09.905 --> 12:10.536
What are you doing?

12:10.537 --> 12:12.756
The... the cable guys
turned the service on,

12:12.757 --> 12:14.463
but I can't reach the outlet
to plug in the damn modem.

12:14.464 --> 12:15.468
- Could you please help me?
- Kevin,

12:15.469 --> 12:17.981
I have, like, 60 guests coming in 7 hours.

12:17.982 --> 12:19.529
- You really have to do this now?
- Yes,

12:19.536 --> 12:21.553
I know, and it's great
that it's your big night.

12:21.554 --> 12:23.047
But I can't look for a
job without the Internet.

12:23.048 --> 12:25.736
Okay, fine. So where is my chef's jacket?

12:25.737 --> 12:27.609
I'll get it later. Can
you just help me push?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.689
- Okay, fine. Here we go.
- Go.

12:30.281 --> 12:32.268
Oh, did I tell you the critic

12:32.269 --> 12:34.108
- from the "L.A. Times" is coming?
- Oh, yeah, that's great.

12:34.109 --> 12:35.255
Yeah. Okay, it's in.

12:35.256 --> 12:35.720
You know, Kevin,

12:35.721 --> 12:37.913
this could be a really big
step forward for both of us.

12:37.914 --> 12:39.024
I just want to make sure that every... ow!

12:39.025 --> 12:39.788
- Ow! Ow!
- What? What? What?

12:39.789 --> 12:42.357
- My hand is stuck!
- Sorry. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

12:42.358 --> 12:44.804
Ow! God, Kevin! God!
I have to cook tonight.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.613
- Did you really have to do this now?!
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?

12:47.614 --> 12:50.397
I'm fine. Could you just
please pick up my chef's jacket?

12:51.564 --> 12:54.621
Yeah, um... Scotty, about tonight,

12:55.014 --> 12:58.213
there's a partner coming
in from a big London firm.

12:58.214 --> 13:00.416
He's stopping off on his way to Japan.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.352
He wants to see me about
opening a practice here,

13:03.353 --> 13:05.209
but he can only meet tonight.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.315
You're kidding me.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.052
I might just be a little bit late.

13:10.053 --> 13:12.676
Well, come on. It wasn't
planned. Look, I need a job.

13:12.677 --> 13:15.201
- You don't know if this
restaurant's gonna work.
- Oh, thanks.

13:15.202 --> 13:17.297
- C... come on. I didn't mean it like that.
- Yeah, you did.

13:17.958 --> 13:18.488
You know what?

13:18.489 --> 13:20.028
There's a lot of things
that we've wanted recently

13:20.029 --> 13:21.645
that haven't worked
out the way we've hoped.

13:21.646 --> 13:23.136
Dreams don't always come true.

13:23.137 --> 13:24.709
You know, Kevin, things have been bad,

13:24.710 --> 13:28.501
- but I don't even recognize you anymore.
- Oh, come on.

13:28.797 --> 13:30.142
I hope you can make it tonight.

13:34.822 --> 13:36.805
We just let things get too bad.

13:36.806 --> 13:38.352
You're just making excuses.

13:38.353 --> 13:39.695
Excuses? I'm not making excuses.

13:39.696 --> 13:41.541
- I'm saying...
- You're trying to blame Kevin.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.816
I'm not blaming him. I'm
saying that it was complicated.

13:43.817 --> 13:45.319
I don't want to hear any more of this.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.498
- This family has always been behind you.
- I know.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.100
The only reason I'm here today

13:50.101 --> 13:52.052
is because we have a
commitment to host this charity.

13:52.053 --> 13:53.621
But I will tell you one thing, Scotty.

13:54.305 --> 13:57.135
I have never been more
disappointed in anyone in my life.

14:11.946 --> 14:14.400
I'm sorry, Mr. Walker, but
I can't wait any longer.

14:14.401 --> 14:15.824
Ms. Lacy was duly summoned... 

14:15.825 --> 14:18.404
She's on her way, Your Honor.
I spoke with her this morning.

14:18.405 --> 14:20.517
Well, it's this afternoon now.

14:21.484 --> 14:24.382
An eviction notice is a court
order if it's not contested.

14:24.383 --> 14:26.256
She'll lose the case by
default if we don't contest.

14:26.257 --> 14:29.664
- I'm well-aware of that.
So where is Ms. Lacy?
- She's on a bus.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.904
She's a 63-year-old woman
with no car or support system.

14:32.905 --> 14:35.480
Mr. Walker, you need to calm down.

14:35.481 --> 14:37.161
Well, maybe if she had
an $80,000 car like you,

14:37.162 --> 14:38.136
- she'd be on time.
- You are

14:38.137 --> 14:40.873
this close to being held
in contempt of court.

14:41.718 --> 14:42.725
Is that her?

14:47.437 --> 14:49.924
No, Your Honor. That would be my mother.

14:50.197 --> 14:51.667
I can't believe you embarrassed me

14:51.668 --> 14:53.008
in front of a courtroom of people.

14:53.009 --> 14:54.660
Well, it's a good thing I showed up.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.840
You were about to get arrested.

14:55.841 --> 14:57.592
Cited. You don't get
arrested for contempt of... 

14:57.593 --> 14:58.988
it doesn't matter. Where is my soda?

14:58.989 --> 15:01.758
This is such a clichÃ©. What,
am I gonna hit the machine now?

15:01.759 --> 15:03.083
You're not gonna hit the machine, Kevin.

15:03.084 --> 15:05.019
You're not... just breathe.
Would you please br... 

15:05.020 --> 15:09.421
sit over here and br... 
for God sakes, breathe.

15:09.817 --> 15:11.472
If you've come here to
help the peace process,

15:11.473 --> 15:14.649
- you should just go home.
- I came here to be with my son.

15:14.650 --> 15:16.455
Did you really say that Scotty and I

15:16.456 --> 15:18.682
- had the perfect marriage on the radio?
- No.

15:19.738 --> 15:22.857
I... I said you have one of
the best marriages I know.

15:23.365 --> 15:24.730
Maybe you should air a retraction.

15:24.731 --> 15:26.393
- I still believe that.
- Mom,

15:26.394 --> 15:28.601
please stop, because you can't fix this.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.652
Kevin, you and Scotty
are so happy together.

15:31.653 --> 15:33.447
You have a great relationship.

15:33.448 --> 15:35.343
Oh, God. You're worse than Kitty.

15:35.344 --> 15:38.720
You have to work it out,
Kevin. You have to work it out.

15:38.721 --> 15:41.373
- You have to try.
- Why, so I end up like you and dad?

15:41.374 --> 15:43.311
And with all due respect,
I don't want your marriage.

15:43.312 --> 15:45.440
- In fact, I did everything I
could to choose someone...
- Oh.

15:45.441 --> 15:47.994
Who I thought was as
different from dad as possible.

15:47.995 --> 15:52.929
- Kevin, Kevin, your father
lied to me year after year...
- Yeah.

15:52.930 --> 15:54.609
After year about a million things,

15:54.610 --> 15:55.841
not just Holly.

15:56.309 --> 15:59.686
Scotty told you the truth.
He didn't have to do that.

15:59.718 --> 16:00.885
That's worth a lot.

16:04.442 --> 16:05.289
Here we go.

16:05.933 --> 16:07.614
Is Scotty in love with this man?

16:07.873 --> 16:10.360
Oh, God. I don't think so. It
couldn't have gone that far.

16:10.361 --> 16:11.273
Do you think?

16:15.032 --> 16:17.081
Luc, do you think we're
crazy, getting married?

16:17.325 --> 16:18.269
Crazy, why?

16:19.792 --> 16:22.433
It just... kind of complicates everything.

16:22.901 --> 16:23.942
And who needs it?

16:24.293 --> 16:26.821
What are you saying? You
aren't ready to get married?

16:27.534 --> 16:28.365
No.

16:30.312 --> 16:31.130
Maybe.

16:31.373 --> 16:33.023
I'm just asking the
question, whether or not

16:33.024 --> 16:34.914
it's worth complicating everything.

16:35.238 --> 16:38.821
Cooper already thinks marriages
expire like a driver's license.

16:39.030 --> 16:41.161
I don't want to put Cooper or Paige

16:41.162 --> 16:42.499
through another divorce.
That would be, like, my

16:42.500 --> 16:44.704
- worst night...
- Divorce? Sarah, I just proposed.

16:44.705 --> 16:46.289
You're already talking about divorce?

16:47.110 --> 16:49.741
No, I'm just saying that
nothing's guaranteed.

16:49.742 --> 16:50.659
What? What?

16:50.660 --> 16:52.271
Les Walker, je sais pas
quoi faire avec vous.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.272
Vous me rendez fou,
mais vous me rendez fou!

16:54.206 --> 16:56.257
Okay, Luc, just stop. I know
you're saying something mean,

16:56.258 --> 16:58.354
- but I can't translate so fast.
- I'm... I'm not... okay.

16:58.446 --> 17:00.286
It's like we go in to a flower shop,

17:00.894 --> 17:03.774
and we find an amazing orchid.

17:03.775 --> 17:06.571
- Okay.
- And yet, you say, "hmm.
Why should I buy this flower?

17:06.573 --> 17:07.790
It's only going to die."

17:08.742 --> 17:11.877
- Okay, I'm not Joe, and you're not Scotty.
- Right.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.580
- I believe in our love.
- I do, too.

17:14.582 --> 17:15.560
I'm not saying for a minute that I

17:15.560 --> 17:17.594
- don't have faith...
- It doesn't sound like it, Sarah.

17:18.162 --> 17:22.097
- You know what? You're
right. It's off. Makes sense.
- What's off?

17:22.749 --> 17:25.348
The engagement? You're taking it back?

17:25.349 --> 17:26.598
No, but you did.

17:27.854 --> 17:28.608
I'm just... 

17:29.185 --> 17:32.189
I'm just sharing with you my concerns.

17:32.190 --> 17:33.356
I'm just... 

17:33.852 --> 17:37.309
saying that I'm... 
worried about my children.

17:38.009 --> 17:39.145
Then be a parent.

17:39.874 --> 17:40.850
Show them the way.

17:44.701 --> 17:46.250
So I've been dying to know.

17:46.251 --> 17:47.259
How was the meeting?

17:47.474 --> 17:49.921
Well, it was kind of amazing actually.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.210
Really?

17:51.788 --> 17:53.479
Does that mean you got the job?

17:53.480 --> 17:56.052
Yeah, but it's a lot more involved

17:56.053 --> 17:57.269
than I even thought.

17:57.545 --> 17:57.953
Yeah?

17:57.954 --> 18:00.557
They are opening an office in Vietnam.

18:00.558 --> 18:02.876
- In Vietnam?
- And they want me to go over there.

18:02.877 --> 18:06.461
- Vietnam?
- Well, the war has
been over a while, Kitty.

18:06.462 --> 18:10.505
No, I know about the
war, but... Vietnam is... 

18:10.506 --> 18:11.579
- Halfway around the world...
- Yeah.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.230
And an entirely different culture.

18:13.312 --> 18:15.041
But that is what's so perfect about it.

18:15.392 --> 18:18.505
I'm not interested in
just making money anymore.

18:18.506 --> 18:22.228
I want to combine who I used to
be with who I think I've become.

18:22.229 --> 18:24.776
Okay. And it's only for a year.
You could sublet the house.

18:24.777 --> 18:27.608
I could what? Wait a minute. Are you... 

18:28.151 --> 18:30.665
thinking that Evan and I
are going to come with you?

18:30.666 --> 18:33.448
Yes, I am seriously thinking
you and Evan are gonna have

18:33.449 --> 18:35.706
the most amazing adventure of your lives.

18:37.226 --> 18:38.653
In Vietnam?

18:38.654 --> 18:41.247
When I first met you, you
said you were on a journey.

18:41.248 --> 18:43.827
- Yeah.
- You were talking about
maybe writing another book.

18:43.906 --> 18:45.650
What a perfect place to do that.

18:48.809 --> 18:50.156
I can't believe this.

18:50.157 --> 18:53.177
Look, if you're not into
it, I'll do something else.

18:53.178 --> 18:54.520
I'm not going without you.

18:55.238 --> 18:57.618
No, it's just that I can't believe

18:57.619 --> 18:59.251
that I am... 

19:00.136 --> 19:02.217
very intrigued.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.637
Yes. I knew it.

19:05.638 --> 19:07.104
No, you did not know anything.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.429
- I'm not checking my frequent flyer Miles.
- Mm.

19:09.430 --> 19:10.677
I'm telling you, Kitty,

19:10.997 --> 19:13.205
we are gonna go amazing places together.

19:15.173 --> 19:16.133
Mm.

19:16.552 --> 19:17.419
Mm.

19:21.101 --> 19:23.543
I wasn't sure we'd get
it all decorated in time.

19:23.544 --> 19:24.577
Oh, this is so wonderful

19:24.578 --> 19:26.532
- of you to do this every year, Nora.
- Thank you.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.150
And what a beautiful restaurant.

19:28.490 --> 19:31.050
Yes, Saul and... and
my son-in-law own it.

19:31.051 --> 19:33.458
- The one you talked about
this morning on your show?
- Yeah.

19:33.459 --> 19:34.715
Oh, is he here tonight?

19:34.716 --> 19:36.443
We can't wait to meet him and his husband.

19:36.753 --> 19:38.808
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.

19:38.809 --> 19:40.224
You think? I wouldn't bet on it.

19:40.225 --> 19:43.620
- Honey, don't be negative.
- It's hard not to be tonight.

19:44.112 --> 19:46.282
Well, thank you so much for coming.

19:46.283 --> 19:48.393
- Thank you for your contribution.
- Come on, sweetheart.

19:48.837 --> 19:49.765
Our pleasure.

19:52.153 --> 19:53.760
All right, Margarita, no salt.

19:53.761 --> 19:54.462
And the two glasses of

19:54.463 --> 19:56.638
- Merlot and the Manhattan, straight up.
- Yes, yes.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.329
Take your time. Older crowd.

19:59.746 --> 20:00.988
I, uh, I'm Marcus, by the way.

20:00.989 --> 20:03.048
- Uh, Justin.
- How long you worked here?

20:03.049 --> 20:04.626
First night. Can you tell?

20:04.627 --> 20:06.836
Not at all. Anyway, I, uh... 

20:06.837 --> 20:08.375
I've got my own drama tonight.

20:08.376 --> 20:11.537
- This, not my usual gig.
- Let me guess. You're an actor.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.036
Straight up Manhattan.

20:14.424 --> 20:16.268
No, uh, the old guy asked me to sub

20:16.269 --> 20:19.069
- for someone sick tonight.
- The o... Saul.

20:19.070 --> 20:21.845
Yeah. I, uh, I worked here
one night before, and, uh,

20:22.357 --> 20:24.357
I mixed a little business with pleasure.

20:25.195 --> 20:26.008
What do you mean?

20:27.119 --> 20:28.595
I hooked up with the chef.

20:29.531 --> 20:31.872
Scotty? Th... that's his name, right?

20:31.873 --> 20:34.272
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I told you... drama.

20:34.472 --> 20:37.142
Anyway, I... I hope his
boyfriend's not here tonight.

20:37.143 --> 20:39.405
- I knew he had one.
- You mean his husband.

20:39.719 --> 20:42.097
Hey, barkeep, give me a shot of bourbon.

20:43.686 --> 20:44.459
How are you?

20:44.823 --> 20:47.059
- Great.
- Uh, look, two merlots. You're all set.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.710
Wait a minute. What's the rush?

20:50.222 --> 20:50.909
Kevin.

20:51.322 --> 20:53.034
Hey. Marcus.

20:53.397 --> 20:55.360
- What's up, Marcus?
- Go, man. I mean it. Go.

20:55.361 --> 20:56.636
Okay, okay.

20:57.336 --> 20:59.993
What, Scotty cheats, but I'm
not even allowed to flirt?

20:59.994 --> 21:01.959
Um, will you watch the
register for a second?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.261
Why? Where are you going?

21:06.174 --> 21:07.734
I need another tray of bruschetta.

21:07.735 --> 21:09.710
And let's get some more of
those fritters out there.

21:09.711 --> 21:10.561
Got it.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.995
Someone needs to peel and
slice these red peppers.

21:14.183 --> 21:15.774
Scotty, I need to talk to you.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.038
Justin, I would love to talk to you, too,

21:17.039 --> 21:18.176
but I got a million and one

21:18.177 --> 21:19.503
- things going on back here.
- Marcus is here.

21:20.327 --> 21:21.402
- Marcus?
- Yeah.

21:27.708 --> 21:29.126
Coming right up.

21:32.013 --> 21:33.012
Oh, hey, Kev.

21:33.475 --> 21:34.225
Hey.

21:34.955 --> 21:36.504
- Where's Justin?
- I don't know.

21:36.505 --> 21:39.456
But he left me in charge. One
double scotch on the rocks.

21:39.457 --> 21:42.222
- Uh, I said a rob roy, didn't I?
- Who's he?

21:42.223 --> 21:44.954
Why don't you let me get that?
I used to tend bar in college.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.986
No, I'm here to assert my right and title

21:46.987 --> 21:48.216
to this building, Jack.

21:48.217 --> 21:51.316
That's legalese for, I've
decided to take a stand,

21:51.317 --> 21:53.002
and it's gonna be at the bar.

21:53.003 --> 21:55.066
- Uh, still need that rob roy.
- I'll make it.

21:55.703 --> 21:56.565
Okay.

21:58.415 --> 22:00.045
Could you please make it two, Jack?

22:00.046 --> 22:01.707
I'm dying to know what rob tastes like.

22:01.708 --> 22:03.094
You don't mind me calling you Rob, do you?

22:03.095 --> 22:05.468
Kev, you're embarrassing yourself.

22:05.469 --> 22:07.884
Am I really? I thought you
were done with politics.

22:07.885 --> 22:11.058
I'm not here positioning myself
for debate or saving face.

22:11.059 --> 22:12.556
- I'm mad, Kit.
- I know.

22:12.557 --> 22:15.319
Really mad. And there are
no talking points for that.

22:18.994 --> 22:21.249
- I can't believe he's here.
- Yeah, he works here, Scotty.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.197
He walked up, ordered drinks,
and then all of a sudden

22:23.198 --> 22:25.088
started bragging about how
he hooked up with the chef.

22:25.089 --> 22:26.887
Okay, I get it. Saul must have called him.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.404
We're understaffed. I
swear to you, Justin,

22:28.405 --> 22:30.429
I have not seen him since it happened.

22:32.629 --> 22:35.309
- All right. I believe you.
- Can you please get rid of him?

22:35.310 --> 22:36.618
- Yeah.
- Be discreet.

22:36.619 --> 22:39.613
- I don't want Kevin any
more hurt than he already is.
- Yeah.

22:39.614 --> 22:40.340
And, Justin.

22:40.341 --> 22:41.091
Yeah.

22:43.466 --> 22:44.241
Thank you.

22:45.616 --> 22:47.703
I made a mistake that may
have cost me my marriage.

22:48.453 --> 22:50.803
I never considered that it
could cost me my family, too.

22:53.165 --> 22:54.254
Help me out, Scotty.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.303
I know how much you love Kevin.

22:56.304 --> 22:58.278
That's obvious. But this guy is a douche.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.264
Like, how did this happen?

23:00.265 --> 23:02.175
I don't want to make excuses.

23:02.176 --> 23:03.801
Then tell me the truth,
'cause, Scotty, I don't... 

23:03.802 --> 23:04.951
like, I don't get it.

23:08.013 --> 23:10.488
The dining room is at capacity.

23:11.213 --> 23:11.997
Kevin, hold on a second.

23:11.998 --> 23:13.245
Wait. I'm not done with that.

23:16.361 --> 23:17.132
Thanks.

23:17.844 --> 23:19.031
Kevin, I saved you a seat.

23:19.032 --> 23:20.544
Everybody's asking where you are.

23:20.545 --> 23:23.507
Yeah, the, uh, the meeting's
taking longer than I expected.

23:23.508 --> 23:24.931
Kevin, this is the most important thing

23:24.932 --> 23:26.326
that's happened to me in a long time.

23:26.327 --> 23:28.494
I... I want you to be here.

23:28.495 --> 23:30.245
I think you need to be here, for us.

23:30.246 --> 23:32.243
It's, uh, it's not gonna work out tonight.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.667
- I'm sorry. I'll...
- Kevin...

23:33.668 --> 23:36.580
- I'll see you at home.
- Table 12

23:36.581 --> 23:38.203
looks like they're about
to eat their silverware.

23:38.204 --> 23:40.241
- Can I take these?
- Uh, yeah.

23:41.072 --> 23:44.234
- You wanna sauce 'em first?
- Thanks.

23:44.784 --> 23:45.498
So... 

23:45.972 --> 23:46.785
bad call?

23:48.446 --> 23:50.024
- Bad night.
- Well, you know, you wouldn't
know it from out there.

23:50.025 --> 23:51.587
People are hungry, they're drunk,

23:51.588 --> 23:53.397
and they're loving everything
coming out of the kitchen.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.461
You're clearly a culinary superstar.

23:56.461 --> 23:57.861
And with that face... 

23:58.989 --> 24:01.049
you should probably have
your own reality show.

24:05.436 --> 24:07.722
One ono and one artichoke.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.388
In fact, when we're done,

24:09.910 --> 24:10.959
I'm buying you a drink.

24:12.173 --> 24:14.084
- I own the place.
- Great.

24:14.484 --> 24:15.810
Then we'll get drunk on you,

24:16.184 --> 24:17.584
which is way better for me.

24:23.955 --> 24:25.716
Scotty, don't you see what happened?

24:26.391 --> 24:28.592
He wasn't trying to be
nice. He was playing you.

24:29.254 --> 24:31.364
He said all the things that
you wanted Kevin to say.

24:31.365 --> 24:33.402
Like I said, I don't want to make excuses.

24:35.014 --> 24:35.490
There you are.

24:35.491 --> 24:37.508
The bar's getting pretty
backed up without you.

24:44.356 --> 24:44.778
Hey.

24:44.779 --> 24:46.954
Marcus, I don't know
what you're doing here,

24:47.141 --> 24:49.108
but what happened that
night was a mistake,

24:49.109 --> 24:50.638
and I need you to please leave.

24:50.639 --> 24:53.651
- Well, this is awkward.
- I need you to leave now.

24:54.652 --> 24:56.972
Well... you know, I could've
got another job tonight.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.832
Are you seriously trying
to get paid right now?

24:58.833 --> 25:00.247
Saul will cut you a
check for the whole night.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.422
- Justin, could you please take care of that?
- Yeah.

25:10.084 --> 25:11.048
Go, man.

25:16.985 --> 25:18.246
Vietnam?

25:18.964 --> 25:21.350
That is exactly what I said to him.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.525
Okay, so what did you say next?

25:24.676 --> 25:27.612
Well, I said that I would think about it.

25:27.917 --> 25:30.777
- Kitty?
- I'm just gonna follow my bliss.

25:30.778 --> 25:32.894
Ah, you make it sound so easy.

25:33.630 --> 25:36.392
Well, it is for you and Luc.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.273
Yeah.

25:39.274 --> 25:40.999
You know, I've got a
little confession to make

25:41.000 --> 25:42.039
about that, actually.

25:42.735 --> 25:44.988
Um, Luc asked me to marry him... 

25:44.989 --> 25:48.360
- proposed, the whole
ring kit and caboodle.
- Oh, my God.

25:48.598 --> 25:50.771
Oh, my God, Sarah, Sarah, that is amazing.

25:50.772 --> 25:51.572
No, it's not.

25:52.422 --> 25:54.972
I messed it up. That's why he's not here.

25:57.197 --> 25:57.931
Did you say no?

25:57.932 --> 26:01.114
No, I said yes. Then I said no.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.788
- Why?
- Because no marriage lasts in this family.

26:04.789 --> 26:07.275
- Oh, please. That...
- No, don't. There's a
curse. The Walker curse.

26:07.276 --> 26:08.107
Do you love him?

26:08.108 --> 26:11.008
Yes, but love is more
complicated than that.

26:11.009 --> 26:13.076
- You know that. It's just...
- Okay, you need to get over yourself,

26:13.077 --> 26:15.482
you need to take the leap,
and you need to marry him.

26:15.483 --> 26:17.454
- If I can go to Vietnam...
- Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

26:17.455 --> 26:20.827
- What?
- The guy Scotty was with is here.

26:20.828 --> 26:21.811
- Here?
- You're kidding.

26:21.812 --> 26:23.926
No. But Saul is paying
him, and then he's leaving.

26:23.927 --> 26:26.556
- Pay him? For... for what?
- For working.

26:26.557 --> 26:28.280
- He's working here now?
- Wait. I don't... I don't... 

26:28.281 --> 26:31.987
- it was a mistake. Saul didn't
know he was "the guy."
- So who's the guy?

26:31.988 --> 26:34.155
- What guy?
- No one.

26:34.755 --> 26:37.114
Uh, I-I have no idea what
they're talking about.

26:37.115 --> 26:38.894
- What are you talking about?
- What guy?

26:42.144 --> 26:44.181
Oh, my God. He's here?

26:45.245 --> 26:46.272
He's one of the waiters?

26:46.273 --> 26:47.514
Look, Kevin, I'm dealing
with it, all right?

26:47.515 --> 26:48.283
- You're dealing with it?
- I'm dealing with it.

26:48.284 --> 26:51.547
So I'm right? This is unbelievable.

26:51.548 --> 26:52.872
- Kevin...
- Kevin, easy, easy.

26:52.873 --> 26:53.788
Which one is he?

26:53.951 --> 26:55.822
- Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
- Just calm down.

26:56.267 --> 26:57.878
Thank you so much for coming.

26:57.879 --> 27:01.258
This is always such a great
day for my family, when we get

27:01.259 --> 27:05.053
to organize the grace hill
historical trust dinner.

27:05.054 --> 27:08.459
Chef. Chef! Chef! Chef! Chef!

27:08.460 --> 27:09.502
Chef! Chef! Chef!

27:09.503 --> 27:12.140
I know. The food is wonderful,
and there he is right there.

27:15.127 --> 27:16.657
Is that him? A rising young star... 

27:16.658 --> 27:17.883
- No.
- That's not him?

27:17.884 --> 27:21.102
No. Oh, my God. It's Rob Roy.

27:21.103 --> 27:22.476
- Who's Rob Roy?
- I know his type.

27:23.276 --> 27:24.588
- God.
- Uh, I hope you all, um, eat a lot...

27:24.589 --> 27:29.000
Okay, let's go. Of food
and just enjoy yourselves,

27:29.001 --> 27:30.805
and... okay.

27:32.168 --> 27:33.442
Hey, Rob Roy.

27:35.037 --> 27:36.749
What the hell, man? I didn't do anything.

27:36.750 --> 27:37.924
No, but you did.

27:40.862 --> 27:42.824
- That's him?!
- Kevin, stop.

28:11.193 --> 28:12.710
Kevin, you can't just
go around hitting people.

28:12.711 --> 28:13.631
Oh, God. You know what?

28:13.632 --> 28:17.394
I am so sick of people
telling me what to do

28:17.594 --> 28:18.490
and how to feel.

28:18.491 --> 28:20.648
- Kevin, the person you want to hit is me.
- A waiter?

28:22.024 --> 28:23.923
A waiter, really?

28:24.173 --> 28:26.235
It's so obvious. I'd have
given you more credit than that.

28:26.236 --> 28:29.504
- Kevin, I had no idea
he was gonna be here.
- Oh, God. More excuses.

28:31.162 --> 28:32.668
Just say it. You've been
wanting to say it all week.

28:32.669 --> 28:33.792
No! Because I don't actually

28:33.793 --> 28:35.738
- want to talk to you.
- You have to talk to me.

28:35.739 --> 28:38.177
You did this. You ruined our marriage... 

28:38.702 --> 28:41.475
everything we fought for... for what?

28:41.476 --> 28:44.309
So you could get groped by a 24 year old.

28:44.772 --> 28:45.959
I get it. You're angry.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.550
I am not angry!

28:47.551 --> 28:50.622
I am in pain, and you put me here!

28:51.472 --> 28:54.398
The person who was supposed
to love me more than anything.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.024
- Kevin...
- You were supposed
to be better than this.

28:57.624 --> 28:58.373
I'm not.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.350
I'm just as lost... 

29:02.148 --> 29:04.937
and damaged and screwed
up as the rest of you.

29:06.910 --> 29:07.967
I'm not perfect, Kevin.

29:07.968 --> 29:10.330
I am not perfect.

29:45.225 --> 29:45.875
Hey.

29:47.673 --> 29:48.473
What's this?

29:49.973 --> 29:52.446
I have to confess that
I have never managed

29:52.447 --> 29:54.923
to keep a houseplant alive
longer than three days.

29:54.924 --> 29:55.744
It's nice.

29:58.167 --> 29:59.593
Tonight was a bloodbath.

30:01.730 --> 30:02.366
In this one day,

30:02.367 --> 30:05.041
this seemingly ideal relationship

30:05.042 --> 30:08.254
just came crashing down around us.

30:10.580 --> 30:11.991
And it reminded me... 

30:13.154 --> 30:14.291
that life is about... 

30:14.942 --> 30:16.292
buying the damn plant... 

30:20.566 --> 30:21.716
Nurturing it,

30:22.503 --> 30:23.155
and watering it,

30:23.156 --> 30:26.520
and... just doing whatever you can

30:26.521 --> 30:29.270
to make sure that it doesn't die.

30:31.957 --> 30:33.871
So you're ready to commit to this plant?

30:35.882 --> 30:37.519
I'm ready to marry you.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.995
So can I take back my take back?

30:45.314 --> 30:47.030
You can take back anything you want.

30:48.797 --> 30:49.784
Thank you.

31:02.131 --> 31:04.344
Wow. Evan is out like a light.

31:04.345 --> 31:06.697
He is so... cute.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.787
He has his Mr. Pig, you
know, his transitional object,

31:09.788 --> 31:10.955
and he's all curled up.

31:10.956 --> 31:14.309
- I guess he doesn't like to sleep alone.
- Who does?

31:14.310 --> 31:16.548
Do you know that in the middle
of all the madness tonight,

31:16.549 --> 31:18.710
I found myself talking to Sarah,

31:18.711 --> 31:20.974
and I was telling her to take a leap?

31:21.323 --> 31:24.074
Obviously, I think I
was talking to myself.

31:27.811 --> 31:29.100
Is that my phone?

31:30.410 --> 31:33.182
I ran into this guy
tonight that I used to know,

31:33.183 --> 31:35.265
and he's starting a solar company.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.957
I just wanted to check if he's for real.

31:36.958 --> 31:39.102
It could be an amazing opportunity.

31:40.576 --> 31:42.352
Kitty... I know people say

31:42.353 --> 31:44.435
you can't make money being green, but... 

31:44.436 --> 31:46.725
Wait a minute. W... wait a minute.

31:46.726 --> 31:47.500
I... 

31:49.063 --> 31:50.687
what happened to Vietnam?

31:50.951 --> 31:53.162
Well, it's still there.
This is just a new idea.

31:53.701 --> 31:54.987
A new idea?

31:56.101 --> 31:57.549
Jack, do you know how many ideas

31:57.550 --> 32:00.112
you have asked me to consider in one day?

32:00.113 --> 32:01.225
I woke up this morning thinking that

32:01.226 --> 32:03.130
you were gonna get a job in L.A.,

32:03.480 --> 32:05.148
and that maybe you were
gonna move in with me,

32:05.149 --> 32:08.391
and after processing that, I
was googling Southeast Asia.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.140
Wow.

32:12.578 --> 32:13.597
Wow. You know, I was... 

32:13.598 --> 32:17.034
I was... seriously considering it.

32:17.035 --> 32:19.688
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to stay open so that we can... 

32:19.689 --> 32:22.270
Open? You can stay open
24/7, Jack, but I'm sorry.

32:22.271 --> 32:24.724
You don't understand. I
can't do that. I have a child.

32:24.725 --> 32:27.674
I'm sorry. It is L.A. It makes me crazy.

32:28.186 --> 32:29.149
That's why I left.

32:30.438 --> 32:31.250
Oh, my gosh.

32:31.251 --> 32:33.996
- Look, I'm trying to
make this work, Kitty...
- You know what?

32:33.997 --> 32:35.627
I... I don't know what I was thinking.

32:35.628 --> 32:37.871
I'm sorry, but I don't
think this is gonna work.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.437
I have a baby. I have a house.

32:39.438 --> 32:42.612
I... I can't just pick up
and go to Vietnam or... 

32:42.613 --> 32:44.414
or go anywhere for that matter.

32:44.415 --> 32:45.348
It... 

32:49.384 --> 32:50.984
Oh, maybe you were just... 

32:51.670 --> 32:54.720
the cute guy I fell for in Ojai.

32:57.484 --> 33:00.583
You mean... I was your
transitional object.

33:02.245 --> 33:05.457
It's okay. Maybe... you were mine, too.

33:09.145 --> 33:10.531
You're sure the waiter's okay?

33:10.532 --> 33:12.291
He could get very litigious on me.

33:12.292 --> 33:14.029
No, he's fine. He's not gonna sue.

33:14.030 --> 33:15.542
I wouldn't blame him if he did.

33:15.543 --> 33:17.834
He told me his girlfriend
cheated on him last year,

33:17.835 --> 33:19.720
and he still wants to punch somebody.

33:23.156 --> 33:24.818
You have a right to be angry, Kevin.

33:25.019 --> 33:26.082
And the fact you wanted

33:26.083 --> 33:28.277
to take the guy's head
off means something.

33:28.278 --> 33:31.033
- Yeah, that I should avoid bourbon.
- Well, that, too.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.572
But it means you care
enough about your marriage

33:34.573 --> 33:37.320
to really fight for it, literally.

33:41.744 --> 33:43.707
Maybe if I'd fought a little earlier... 

33:47.807 --> 33:50.081
mom, Scotty's not the
only one to blame for this.

33:51.857 --> 33:53.806
This didn't exactly happen in a vacuum.

33:55.568 --> 33:57.446
Do you remember the opening
night party for this restaurant?

33:57.447 --> 34:00.070
God, that was a terrible
time for everybody.

34:01.570 --> 34:02.784
I wasn't even there.

34:04.057 --> 34:07.077
Yeah, the, uh, the meeting's
taking longer than I expected.

34:07.078 --> 34:08.518
Kevin, this is the most important thing

34:08.518 --> 34:09.969
that's happened to me in a long time.

34:09.969 --> 34:11.248
I... I want you to be here.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.956
I think you need to be here, for us.

34:12.958 --> 34:16.081
It's, uh, it's not gonna
work out tonight. I'm sorry.

34:16.083 --> 34:18.382
- I'll... I'll see you at home.
- Kevin...

34:20.331 --> 34:21.181
I'll take another.

34:24.418 --> 34:25.081
Who's the meeting with?

34:25.083 --> 34:25.989
What?

34:27.089 --> 34:28.114
Oh, uh... 

34:30.288 --> 34:31.301
there is no meeting.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.898
Uh, that was my husband, and I lied.

34:35.501 --> 34:36.447
He's having... 

34:36.589 --> 34:39.152
the most important night
of his professional career,

34:39.152 --> 34:40.772
and I decided to stay here.

34:41.735 --> 34:44.109
It's not that I'm jealous or anything.

34:44.110 --> 34:45.839
It's just, I can't
seem to do anything else

34:45.840 --> 34:48.684
but hate myself these days.

34:48.685 --> 34:51.010
So what does that say about me?

34:52.871 --> 34:54.947
You don't have to answer
that. I already know.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.124
I was just stuck.

35:07.050 --> 35:08.942
I was so traumatized by what had happened,

35:08.943 --> 35:10.524
I couldn't be there for anyone... 

35:12.198 --> 35:13.223
not even Scotty.

35:14.536 --> 35:15.611
You have to tell him.

35:17.099 --> 35:17.835
Why?

35:18.998 --> 35:20.624
Because this could change everything.

35:20.625 --> 35:21.830
It's part of the problem.

35:21.831 --> 35:23.968
Oh... mom, I get it.

35:23.969 --> 35:26.343
I was... I was... I was pathetic.

35:26.344 --> 35:27.907
What I did was heartless.

35:28.368 --> 35:29.581
But am I crazy to think

35:29.582 --> 35:31.393
his punishment didn't fit the crime?

35:31.394 --> 35:33.229
This isn't about crime or punishment

35:33.230 --> 35:35.193
or who did what to whom.

35:35.639 --> 35:37.877
This is about figuring all of it out

35:37.878 --> 35:40.101
so you can find your
way back to each other.

35:41.614 --> 35:42.964
Mom, honestly... 

35:43.976 --> 35:47.651
all I want is to get back
to where we were before... 

35:48.688 --> 35:51.626
and just make like this never happened.

35:54.563 --> 35:55.838
Then you have to tell him.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.349
He was brave enough to take the first step

35:58.350 --> 35:59.600
and tell you the truth.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.101
Now it's your turn.

36:12.306 --> 36:14.270
Scotty, I found these glasses outside.

36:14.271 --> 36:15.459
People must have been smoking.

36:15.460 --> 36:16.821
Uh, thanks.

36:17.469 --> 36:19.451
Y... you can go home.
I'll clean up this mess.

36:19.452 --> 36:22.219
No, no, no. I wanted
to talk to you anyway.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.069
Scotty, I was upset.

36:26.056 --> 36:27.094
I'm still upset.

36:29.131 --> 36:30.806
I was being loyal to my nephew.

36:30.807 --> 36:32.444
You hurt my family.

36:33.768 --> 36:34.826
But the thing is, I realized

36:34.827 --> 36:37.118
that taking sides isn't
quite as simple as that,

36:37.119 --> 36:40.818
because... you see, you're my family, too.

36:42.105 --> 36:43.192
Saul, you don't have to... 

36:43.193 --> 36:45.165
Let me finish. Please.

36:46.265 --> 36:48.610
I know you don't want anyone
to think that you're perfect.

36:49.635 --> 36:52.412
But to me, even with all of this stuff... 

36:55.010 --> 36:56.969
you two are about as close to perfect

36:56.970 --> 36:58.495
as anything I've ever seen.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.060
Yeah.

37:02.845 --> 37:05.494
And I guess because I was
raised at a time when... 

37:05.495 --> 37:08.095
when a real relationship between two men,

37:09.283 --> 37:10.520
much less marriage,

37:11.295 --> 37:12.894
seemed impossible... 

37:13.795 --> 37:15.720
you and Kevin were living my dream.

37:16.921 --> 37:18.968
And when I... when I
found out what happened,

37:18.969 --> 37:22.565
I just... suddenly, everything
seemed less possible again.

37:22.566 --> 37:25.935
Saul... everything is still possible.

37:27.521 --> 37:30.346
Don't let what I did
make you give up hope.

37:33.909 --> 37:35.284
I won't if you won't.

37:39.996 --> 37:40.933
Did you eat yet?

37:41.802 --> 37:42.492
No.

37:42.493 --> 37:44.644
How about I make you some ricotta fritters

37:44.957 --> 37:47.021
with a little... little
bit of chestnut honey?

37:47.022 --> 37:47.997
It's the secret.

37:53.575 --> 37:54.649
All right, boys,

37:54.650 --> 37:56.150
show me your hands.

37:57.663 --> 38:00.107
Oh, Kevin. Look, you hurt yours.

38:00.108 --> 38:01.696
Mom, it's a paper cut.

38:01.697 --> 38:04.136
Oh. Oh, God, that felt good.

38:04.137 --> 38:06.192
I hear that. Bros over hos.

38:06.193 --> 38:07.434
At least you hit the right guy.

38:07.435 --> 38:10.217
Yeah, well, I have to admit,
I didn't do it just for you.

38:10.992 --> 38:12.434
Unfortunately, when
Rebecca and I broke up,

38:12.435 --> 38:14.454
it was our fault, so there
was no one I could hit.

38:14.455 --> 38:17.824
Justin, you're going to
find someone else. You are.

38:17.825 --> 38:19.163
- All right. All right. Thank you.
- Hey.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.450
Hey.

38:21.513 --> 38:22.346
Hey.

38:22.347 --> 38:24.042
Kitty, are you all right?

38:24.043 --> 38:27.636
- Oh, it's... it's just,
Jack and I broke up.
- Really?

38:27.637 --> 38:29.092
- I love that guy.
- What happened?

38:29.093 --> 38:31.527
Oh, you know, he wasn't that
great, and nothing happened.

38:31.528 --> 38:33.239
It's just... I don't know.

38:33.240 --> 38:36.152
- I guess it's just time for us to move on.
- That sucks.

38:36.153 --> 38:39.363
Oh, you know, it's okay. I
mean, I'm very glad I met him,

38:39.364 --> 38:41.471
but... I'm sorry, mom. I called the sitter

38:41.472 --> 38:43.670
as soon as he left so
I could come over here.

38:43.671 --> 38:46.090
- I think someone needs a sundae.
- Thank you.

38:46.091 --> 38:49.605
- Yes, and this, too, honey.
- Oh, thank you.

38:49.606 --> 38:51.886
- I'm so sorry.
- No. No, you know what? It's okay.

38:51.887 --> 38:54.092
This way, I don't have to go to Vietnam.

38:54.842 --> 38:56.385
Vietnam?

38:56.435 --> 38:58.936
- Hey!
- Uh-oh. Trouble.

38:59.272 --> 39:01.996
- Sarah.
- Sarah. Well, why are you here so late?

39:01.997 --> 39:02.759
Is everything all right?

39:02.760 --> 39:03.459
Yeah, it's fine.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.618
It's good. It's great, actually.

39:05.619 --> 39:07.793
We just thought, um, after tonight

39:07.794 --> 39:10.460
that we should come
over and give you hope.

39:10.461 --> 39:11.356
Sarah!

39:11.357 --> 39:13.501
- Oh! Oh! Kevin's in the pantry!
- What? It's a car...

39:13.502 --> 39:15.152
Kevin's in the pantry.

39:18.002 --> 39:18.535
Oh. Oh, great.

39:18.536 --> 39:21.120
So now the whole family has to
come over to take pity on me?

39:21.783 --> 39:22.866
Yeah. Uh... 

39:24.054 --> 39:25.254
Yeah, how are you, Kevin?

39:25.255 --> 39:27.604
Bad question. What's... what's going on?

39:29.029 --> 39:29.853
Nothing.

39:31.228 --> 39:33.091
We just, um, we... we
thought we'd come over

39:33.092 --> 39:36.264
for some sundae... ss.

39:36.265 --> 39:37.115
Yeah. Sundaes.

39:37.116 --> 39:38.764
- Love sundaes.
- Could you stop lying?

39:39.439 --> 39:40.282
I really don't think you want to

39:40.283 --> 39:43.133
- know after...
- Whatever it is, can you tell me, please?

39:43.520 --> 39:44.244
I'm serious, guys.

39:44.245 --> 39:46.246
You're all I have right
now, so no more secrets.

39:48.945 --> 39:50.120
That is... 

39:50.883 --> 39:53.245
- Amazing.
- Oh, I didn't want to tell you.

39:53.246 --> 39:54.645
Come on. Are you kidding me?!

39:56.369 --> 40:00.747
- I love Luc. I'm so happy for you guys.
- Congratulations!

40:00.748 --> 40:02.846
- That's amazing.
- Come on. Come on. Let's get the ice cream.

40:02.847 --> 40:05.893
- Let's get this show on the road.
- I know. I know.

40:07.008 --> 40:08.053
Can I stay at yours tonight?

40:08.054 --> 40:10.840
- Uh, yeah, sure. I just got a new couch.
- Great.

40:11.108 --> 40:13.194
Bubbly. Bubbly!

40:13.195 --> 40:14.800
Oh, my goodness... 

40:14.801 --> 40:17.694
Yesterday we did a lot
of talking about marriage,

40:17.695 --> 40:20.382
and... I've been thinking.

40:21.382 --> 40:22.970
There's something else I'd like to say.

40:24.074 --> 40:25.789
The thing about a good marriage is,

40:25.790 --> 40:28.449
even if a terrible mistake happens,

40:29.362 --> 40:33.024
you just can't imagine
your life with anyone else.

40:34.193 --> 40:35.513
That's why you commit to each other,

40:35.514 --> 40:37.904
that's why you make vows to each other... 

40:38.579 --> 40:40.662
That, through the good or the bad,

40:40.663 --> 40:42.518
you just keep trying.

40:43.278 --> 40:44.703
You're fighting not only for love.

40:44.704 --> 40:45.941
You're fighting... 

40:46.541 --> 40:49.016
for something bigger
than either one of you.

40:50.053 --> 40:52.308
You're fighting for the
family you've become.

40:52.309 --> 40:53.209
You're fighting... 

40:54.071 --> 40:55.642
for the us you've become,

40:55.643 --> 40:58.668
and... that really is worth fighting for.

41:02.779 --> 41:03.505
Hey.

41:04.379 --> 41:04.917
Hi.

41:04.918 --> 41:06.434
Where are you? I was worried about you.

41:07.521 --> 41:10.034
I'm at Kitty's. I slept on the couch.

41:10.181 --> 41:12.605
Well, you know, I
wouldn't call it sleeping.

41:12.606 --> 41:15.268
More like barely achieving
a semi-unconscious state?

41:17.106 --> 41:17.893
I know what you mean.

41:21.833 --> 41:23.200
Glad you had someplace to go.

41:25.741 --> 41:27.560
Do you know what the
hardest thing about this is?

41:29.098 --> 41:30.582
Whenever anything bad happens... 

41:32.307 --> 41:35.295
you are the person I want to talk to most.

41:39.409 --> 41:40.198
Kev... 

41:43.409 --> 41:44.481
do you want to come home?

41:46.858 --> 41:47.645
No.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.045
So what do we do now?

41:59.266 --> 42:01.053
There's something I have to tell you.
