STEVE: Ah, I don't think so,
baby.

02:16.133 --> 02:18.034
I gotta fly to LA
pretty early in the morning

02:18.036 --> 02:19.601
and meet with
some of the investors, so...

02:19.603 --> 02:21.136
I could come with you.

02:21.138 --> 02:24.940
Yeah, not sure Rob would
approve of that, do you?

02:24.942 --> 02:26.242
I don't really think
I want him knowing

02:26.244 --> 02:29.048
about my investment
in his wife.

02:32.017 --> 02:34.917
Right.

02:34.919 --> 02:35.921
That's right, baby.

my big man?

02:56.006 --> 02:57.240
Jesus fucking...

02:57.242 --> 03:00.208
No, no, no, not you.

03:00.210 --> 03:02.312
Mike, Mike, Mike.

03:02.314 --> 03:03.612
Listen, I hear
what you're saying.

03:03.614 --> 03:05.615
You got nothing
to be concerned about.

03:05.617 --> 03:07.950
But it's moving forward
as planned.

03:07.952 --> 03:10.320
Look, I'm not happy about
a delay either, Mike.

03:10.322 --> 03:12.254
I'm going through
a patchy space.

03:12.256 --> 03:13.558
Hang on one second.

03:15.626 --> 03:18.060
Goddamn it,
you are fucking beautiful.

03:18.062 --> 03:19.665
- Thank you.
- Call me.

03:21.266 --> 03:23.065
I gave the architect
an opportunity

03:23.067 --> 03:24.399
to give us
an entire new level.

03:24.401 --> 03:27.070
You know what that means.

03:27.072 --> 03:28.371
Okay, you don't know
what it means,

03:28.373 --> 03:29.605
but you know me,
and I know what it means,

03:29.607 --> 03:31.240
so I can explain it you.

03:31.242 --> 03:33.542
Mike, look, I didn't mean
to offend you.

03:33.544 --> 03:35.344
If I did, I apologize.

03:35.346 --> 03:37.313
Lucky for you,
I found additional investors

03:37.315 --> 03:39.015
that put in twice
what you put in.

03:39.017 --> 03:40.482
That's what allowed us
the additional level.

03:40.484 --> 03:43.152
Ten extra units.
I'll tell you what that does.

03:43.154 --> 03:45.722
Now, you invest X,
it's all good, good.

03:45.724 --> 03:49.024
You don't get a return of Y.
You get a return of Y and Z

03:49.026 --> 03:51.226
because that's
how I roll, bitches!

03:51.228 --> 03:53.028
That sound good?

06:41.466 --> 06:43.668
The only reason
you are wearing that gag

06:44.699 --> 06:47.803
is because I cannot stand
the sound of your fucking voice.

Steve Walsh.

I have to be careful
about dealing with issues

16:12.302 --> 16:14.970
I'm sure it's
very difficult for you.

16:14.972 --> 16:17.206
Very diplomatic of you there,
Farrel.

16:17.208 --> 16:20.108
There's no need
to sugarcoat things here,

16:20.110 --> 16:23.912
unless you're wearing a wire.

16:23.914 --> 16:26.881
I'm just fucking with you,
I'm just, I'm just...

16:26.883 --> 16:28.884
It's a joke. You can laugh.

16:28.886 --> 16:31.452
Come on. And where is he?
Is he down there?

16:31.454 --> 16:33.856
Here's your guy, Mr. Walsh.

16:33.858 --> 16:35.991
Hello, buddy!

16:35.993 --> 16:38.128
Hey, Walshy!

16:40.263 --> 16:41.864
Shaun.

16:41.866 --> 16:43.332
Goddamn it.

16:43.334 --> 16:45.199
If you got a cell phone,
you gotta call the cops.

16:45.201 --> 16:46.834
Motherfucker
put me in a trunk.

16:46.836 --> 16:47.970
I swear, I don't even
know what the fuck...

16:47.972 --> 16:49.237
We're not here to save you.

16:49.239 --> 16:51.475
You owe me a phone call.

16:54.344 --> 16:56.377
Yeah, yeah, I, I...

16:56.379 --> 16:59.213
I know. I know I owe you
a phone call.

16:59.215 --> 17:01.382
Look, I just found out
last night

17:01.384 --> 17:03.452
that the funds
didn't go through.

17:03.454 --> 17:06.021
Look, the day after
I authorized the transfer,

17:06.022 --> 17:08.422
I got called to Minneapolis,
my mother, God rest her,

17:08.424 --> 17:10.461
she got diagnosed
with Alzheimer's and...

17:13.296 --> 17:15.296
Christ.
Shaun, you of all people,

17:15.298 --> 17:17.233
should understand
about family.

17:19.804 --> 17:22.236
Wait, it, it, it...

17:22.238 --> 17:24.005
Goddamn it,
why didn't you call me?

17:24.007 --> 17:27.309
We could have got
back to the table.

17:27.310 --> 17:30.879
It... It doesn't
even matter, okay?

17:30.881 --> 17:34.015
Look, I figured out
the location.

17:34.017 --> 17:35.217
I swear to God.

17:35.219 --> 17:37.852
I got M. Night Shyamalan
to direct this.

17:37.854 --> 17:39.854
The only thing I need is another
Audrey audition tape,

17:39.856 --> 17:41.223
and we're good to go.

17:41.225 --> 17:42.925
No. That's enough out of you.

17:42.927 --> 17:44.959
You could just stop
fucking talking, okay?

17:44.961 --> 17:47.896
- I swear to God.
- Not another word.

17:47.898 --> 17:51.233
You need to understand
something, Walsh.

17:51.235 --> 17:53.368
Your time for talking is over.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.336
Now, I know this is
gonna be hard for you,

17:55.338 --> 17:59.209
but I need you to listen
to what I have to say.

18:01.178 --> 18:03.978
When I say listen,
I mean it.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.014
If you lips even part
before I'm finished,

18:06.016 --> 18:08.382
Lucas will cut you
from ear to ear.

18:08.384 --> 18:10.084
- Okay?
- Yeah.

18:10.086 --> 18:12.588
Now, did you know
that Mr. Farrel and I

18:12.590 --> 18:14.188
have something in common?

18:14.190 --> 18:16.057
No, don't answer.

18:16.059 --> 18:20.262
You came to me over a year ago
with a business offer,

18:20.264 --> 18:23.098
but you didn't approach me
like a man.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.432
You didn't walk in
through the front door

18:24.434 --> 18:26.067
and make an appointment.

18:26.069 --> 18:29.871
No, you came at me
through my only blind spot.

18:29.873 --> 18:33.641
You used my daughter.
You used my Audrey.

18:33.643 --> 18:36.078
You filled her head
with dreams of fame and stardom.

18:36.080 --> 18:40.248
She believed in you.
She loved you.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.252
And I trusted in the faith
that she had in you,

18:43.254 --> 18:45.621
but you lost my money.

18:45.623 --> 18:48.957
I didn't lose as much as the guy
sitting above us right now.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.524
No, he lost everything

18:50.526 --> 18:53.128
all because of the promises
you couldn't deliver.

18:53.130 --> 18:54.996
Now, don't get me wrong.

18:54.998 --> 18:56.598
I don't give a fuck about
Mr. Farrel and his misfortune,

18:56.600 --> 19:01.069
but I need you to understand
how that brought us here

19:01.071 --> 19:03.104
to this basement.

19:03.106 --> 19:06.041
You took away his pride,
his money and fame,

19:06.043 --> 19:07.508
and you wiped your ass
with it.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.611
He lost his wife and
his daughter because of you.

19:09.613 --> 19:12.613
You pushed a man to the limits
with all your lies,

19:12.615 --> 19:15.182
and this is the result, Walsh.

19:15.184 --> 19:17.953
Now...

19:17.955 --> 19:21.023
it's time to pay the piper.

19:21.025 --> 19:22.925
Cut him, Lucas.

19:22.927 --> 19:25.526
STEVE: No, no.

19:25.528 --> 19:29.965
[groaning, screaming]

19:29.967 --> 19:32.237
[grunting]

19:33.703 --> 19:36.138
You remember Louis the Frog?

19:36.140 --> 19:37.939
It's okay, you can answer.

19:37.941 --> 19:40.609
You remember him?

19:40.611 --> 19:42.710
Yeah, yeah.

19:42.712 --> 19:47.282
Fucker used fake French accents
to get laid.

19:47.284 --> 19:49.217
Yeah, yeah, that's the guy.

19:49.219 --> 19:52.254
You know what happened to him?

19:52.256 --> 19:54.622
No, I have no idea.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.190
I didn't see him.

19:56.192 --> 19:58.392
No, and you'll
never see him again.

19:58.394 --> 20:00.330
You wanna know why?

20:03.267 --> 20:06.301
Louis...

20:06.303 --> 20:08.669
stole from me.

20:08.671 --> 20:11.105
Eight kilos of cocaine

20:11.107 --> 20:14.008
without so much as a thank you

20:14.010 --> 20:17.211
or a kiss on my ass.

20:17.213 --> 20:19.147
Sounds like he got
what he fucking deserved then.

20:19.149 --> 20:22.184
I'm so glad you understand
the situation, know what I mean?

20:22.186 --> 20:25.620
See, no matter who you are,
nobody steals from me.

20:25.622 --> 20:28.223
You pay for what you took.

20:28.225 --> 20:29.992
I didn't steal from you.

20:29.994 --> 20:33.932
Shaun, I invested your money.

20:35.265 --> 20:37.631
You need to understand
the risk level,

20:37.633 --> 20:39.266
what you're comfortable with

20:39.268 --> 20:41.570
'cause that's
the film business.

20:41.572 --> 20:43.572
All right, well,
the only person

20:43.574 --> 20:46.507
who needs to understand
anything here is you.

20:46.509 --> 20:48.176
You stole from me,

20:48.178 --> 20:50.512
and now it's time
to pay for what you took.

20:50.514 --> 20:51.983
[claps]
So...

20:53.249 --> 20:55.050
Before I leave,

20:55.052 --> 20:59.787
I'm gonna inflict
a hundred grand's worth of pain

20:59.789 --> 21:01.658
on you.

21:03.259 --> 21:05.159
What the fuck?

21:05.161 --> 21:07.131
What the fuck are you doing?

21:09.232 --> 21:11.265
Okay, wait, wait, wait!

21:11.267 --> 21:12.601
You didn't have to remind me
this morning,

21:12.603 --> 21:14.335
and you don't have
to remind me now.

21:14.337 --> 21:17.605
She's my daughter.
I know it's her birthday.

21:17.607 --> 21:19.408
No!

21:19.410 --> 21:22.580
Look, I will be there
for 7:00.

21:25.315 --> 21:28.149
Half past at the latest.

21:28.151 --> 21:30.721
I just have some stuff
I have to deal with.

21:34.091 --> 21:36.260
No, I'm not drinking again.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.733
If you have to know,
I'm writing.

21:47.171 --> 21:49.403
Joan...

21:49.405 --> 21:53.641
Joan, I can't argue with you
right now, okay?

21:53.643 --> 21:55.445
I'll see you tonight.

21:58.148 --> 21:59.617
[groaning]

22:01.751 --> 22:03.584
Stop! God!

22:03.586 --> 22:06.755
Now, why would I do that?

22:06.757 --> 22:08.622
Look in the case.

22:08.624 --> 22:10.391
I can pay you back.

22:10.393 --> 22:12.093
I've heard that before.

22:12.095 --> 22:13.261
Swear to God,
I can pay you back today,

22:13.263 --> 22:14.595
all of it, with interest.

22:14.597 --> 22:17.100
- Bullshit.
- Look in the fucking case!

22:19.369 --> 22:21.236
- There's a check in there.
- Checks?

22:21.238 --> 22:23.074
Who the fuck uses checks
these days?

22:32.181 --> 22:33.681
"Robert Waldram."

22:33.683 --> 22:35.684
Ah, you've moved to scams
in the big leagues.

22:35.686 --> 22:38.352
It's not a scam.
It's not a fucking scam.

22:38.354 --> 22:40.788
It's a serious business venture.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.890
It's a holiday resort
in Dubai.

22:42.892 --> 22:45.494
I'll get you in on the
ground floor, I swear to God.

22:45.496 --> 22:48.763
250,000. That's decent return
on my investment.

22:48.765 --> 22:51.302
I can get it
digitally transferred.

22:57.473 --> 23:00.708
- So we're good?
- Yeah, we're good.

23:00.710 --> 23:03.378
But you still owe Audrey
an apology.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.348
Yeah.

23:06.182 --> 23:08.149
Hey!

23:08.151 --> 23:09.219
What?

23:10.586 --> 23:13.588
Cut me loose.
You said we're good.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.756
I'm not the only one
you got business with.

23:15.758 --> 23:17.859
Hey! The fuck are you going?

23:17.861 --> 23:20.829
I have a feeling you're
not getting out of here.

23:20.831 --> 23:23.165
No! Goddamn it!

23:23.167 --> 23:24.899
Get the fuck...

23:24.901 --> 23:27.201
Shaun, fuck you!

23:27.203 --> 23:29.504
STEVE: Goddamn it!
I swear to fucking God!

23:29.506 --> 23:31.273
Finished with him?

23:31.275 --> 23:35.213
Yeah. He's beaten,
but he's still breathing.

23:40.950 --> 23:43.919
- Then our business is done.
- And we were never here.

23:43.921 --> 23:45.754
PETER: Of course.

23:45.756 --> 23:48.456
Erase what you recorded.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.261
I'm right in the middle.

23:51.761 --> 23:53.661
The folders too.

23:53.663 --> 23:55.365
Sure.

24:00.237 --> 24:02.704
[tapping keys]

24:02.706 --> 24:03.908
Hmm.

24:20.856 --> 24:22.359
[exhales]

24:26.930 --> 24:30.634
"Fuck you, he said."

24:34.837 --> 24:37.174
[engine starts]

24:40.744 --> 24:41.846
Hello?

24:44.680 --> 24:47.415
Yeah, he, uh...

24:47.417 --> 24:49.353
The package is secure.

24:52.823 --> 24:56.561
No, I'm sorry, Senator,
the fee isn't negotiable.

24:59.028 --> 25:00.530
All right, then.

25:02.298 --> 25:04.734
I'll forward the address
to this number.

25:25.588 --> 25:28.291
PETER: You got another visitor
coming soon.

25:33.663 --> 25:35.799
Why are you doing this, Pete?

25:39.503 --> 25:42.273
I think your last guest
explained it pretty well.

25:43.940 --> 25:47.708
No. Actually never came up
with anything that made sense.

25:47.710 --> 25:50.044
Certainly nothing to warrant
fucking kidnapping

25:50.046 --> 25:54.549
and zip ties
and fucking torture.

25:54.551 --> 25:57.288
- Certainly nothing...
- [table rattles]

25:59.323 --> 26:01.055
You invested in a film
that I set up.

26:01.057 --> 26:04.892
Maybe it didn't turn out
the way that you planned.

26:04.894 --> 26:08.763
That's the movie business,
buddy, you know that.

26:08.765 --> 26:12.003
I tried to explain that shit
to Douglas, but fuck.

26:16.539 --> 26:18.742
Yeah, I believed you, Steve.

26:20.544 --> 26:24.111
I thought you were this
big-time Hollywood producer,

26:24.113 --> 26:26.348
and you believed in my script.

26:26.350 --> 26:27.881
You were gonna help me
make my movie.

26:27.883 --> 26:29.984
What the fuck you mean,
I don't believe in your script?

26:29.986 --> 26:31.719
Of course I believe
in your script.

26:31.721 --> 26:33.822
I'm the one that fucking
suggested you get an agent.

26:33.824 --> 26:36.024
That was me.

26:36.026 --> 26:37.859
I should get an agent.

26:37.861 --> 26:39.729
An agent
because it's fucking good.

26:42.932 --> 26:46.836
You... saw me
as an opportunity.

26:48.738 --> 26:53.541
Listen, man, I never forced you
to do shit, not once.

26:53.543 --> 26:56.578
No. You just told me
everything I needed to hear,

26:56.580 --> 26:57.948
so that I would.

26:59.615 --> 27:01.983
My daughter's college fund,

27:01.985 --> 27:04.852
second mortgage on the house,

27:04.854 --> 27:07.621
I gave you everything.

27:07.623 --> 27:11.626
How am I supposed to know
about your financial situation?

27:11.628 --> 27:13.628
If I'd known you ran that
close to the fucking edge,

27:13.630 --> 27:17.631
- maybe I wouldn't have...
- You wouldn't have what?

27:17.633 --> 27:18.967
You wouldn't have what?

27:18.969 --> 27:24.104
- That, that, that...
- Let me ask you.

27:24.106 --> 27:28.042
Would you have stopped me
from taking that first drink?

27:28.044 --> 27:32.179
Would you have stopped me from
being an asshole to my wife?

27:32.181 --> 27:34.748
Would you have stopped me from
getting in the car that day?

27:34.750 --> 27:35.952
What car?

27:42.892 --> 27:45.159
We're done talking.

27:45.161 --> 27:47.161
What the fuck
are you talking about?

27:47.163 --> 27:49.663
Pete, Pete!

27:49.665 --> 27:51.666
How the fuck
am I supposed to know

27:51.668 --> 27:54.768
that you're an asshole
to your wife?

27:54.770 --> 27:56.838
Maybe you give her
a coat when she's cold!

27:56.840 --> 27:58.605
Maybe you hold the door open!

27:58.607 --> 28:01.676
But maybe you don't pull
her hair when you bang her!

28:01.678 --> 28:03.611
God!

28:03.613 --> 28:04.946
[spits]

28:04.948 --> 28:08.552
They like that shit,
you fucking pussy!

28:48.257 --> 28:50.960
Steve, Steve.

28:52.895 --> 28:55.830
There's somebody else
here to see you.

28:55.832 --> 28:57.998
Please tell me
it's not my mom. Christ.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.003
Taken enough shit for one day.

29:01.805 --> 29:06.140
ANDREW: You were always one
for a good joke, Steve.

29:06.142 --> 29:10.011
And there was a time when
I would've laughed with you.

29:10.013 --> 29:13.081
Holy shit, Andrew.

29:13.083 --> 29:15.883
I ain't seen you since you
were the Democratic poster boy.

29:15.885 --> 29:19.786
Yeah, well, we were both
a lot younger then.

29:19.788 --> 29:21.755
Yeah.

29:21.757 --> 29:23.957
You mind if we have
a moment alone?

29:23.959 --> 29:27.131
We have some business
to discuss in private.

29:33.670 --> 29:36.103
You don't have a stick of gum,
do you?

29:36.105 --> 29:40.108
Cocksucker punched me in the
nose a couple times. Just...

29:40.110 --> 29:42.110
Fuckin' tastes like blood,
you know?

29:42.112 --> 29:43.913
ANDREW: Yeah, I do.

29:47.717 --> 29:48.853
I can't...

29:54.690 --> 29:56.125
I appreciate it.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.834
So... what the fuck
are you doing here?

30:07.836 --> 30:09.836
I, uh...

30:09.838 --> 30:12.008
Sure you want something
from me, right?

30:14.978 --> 30:18.813
Do you remember
when we first met?

30:18.815 --> 30:20.582
[chuckles]

30:20.584 --> 30:22.950
Yeah, you fucking weirdo.

30:22.952 --> 30:24.953
The Italian restaurant.
I don't remember the name.

30:24.955 --> 30:27.889
- Starts with a fucking C.
- Carpaccios.

30:27.891 --> 30:31.124
Nice beef with
a Stilton gravy on it.

30:31.126 --> 30:34.094
The waitress with the legs all
the way up to her fucking ass.

30:34.096 --> 30:35.330
I remember.

30:35.332 --> 30:37.765
I got my face
buried in that ass.

30:37.767 --> 30:38.999
Fucking glorious.

30:39.001 --> 30:41.738
What you told me that night?

30:44.940 --> 30:46.640
I...

30:46.642 --> 30:50.044
We talked about a number
of things that night, buddy.

30:50.046 --> 30:52.613
Half the conversations were
under the influence of vino.

30:52.615 --> 30:55.283
Well, let me remind you.

30:55.285 --> 30:57.351
You promised the ring
off your finger

30:57.353 --> 30:59.720
that you could triple
my campaign money

30:59.722 --> 31:01.889
in less than 72 hours.

31:01.891 --> 31:04.257
Yeah, I remember
the conversation.

31:04.259 --> 31:06.127
I remember distinctively
the conversation.

31:06.129 --> 31:08.228
It was the Flomech deal.

31:08.230 --> 31:11.064
Of course. I mean, it was
a fucking rock solid deal.

31:11.066 --> 31:14.636
Each and every one of us were on
the fucking ground floor, yeah.

31:14.638 --> 31:17.237
Then why did I end up
with an empty account

31:17.239 --> 31:18.773
and no ring from your finger?

31:18.775 --> 31:21.743
For the same fucking reason
that I did.

31:21.745 --> 31:23.844
No one in their right mind
could have foreseen

31:23.846 --> 31:25.846
the CEO being brought up
on charges

31:25.848 --> 31:27.915
- for insider trading.
- But still...

31:27.917 --> 31:30.284
If the deal presented itself
today, I'd recommend you do it.

31:30.286 --> 31:32.352
Still, you promised me
that ring.

31:32.354 --> 31:33.854
There is no ring!

31:33.856 --> 31:36.157
You're right!
There is no ring.

31:36.159 --> 31:37.659
- Then what?
- Then it looks like

31:37.661 --> 31:39.326
I'm taking
the fucking finger!

31:39.328 --> 31:42.162
No! I can pay you!
Goddamn it!

31:42.164 --> 31:43.296
Then continue.

31:43.298 --> 31:46.234
Fuck, you gonna cut my finger?

31:46.236 --> 31:49.003
You put in 100,000 with
a promise for three in return.

31:49.005 --> 31:50.938
Fine! Goddamn it!

31:50.940 --> 31:52.273
Plus interest.

31:52.275 --> 31:53.908
Fine! What kind of interest
do you want?

31:53.910 --> 31:57.378
That was a while back.
How about... 50?

31:57.380 --> 32:00.782
Fine. 50 grand.
Done, fine.

32:00.784 --> 32:02.283
Fuck!

32:02.285 --> 32:04.121
Goddamn it!

32:07.457 --> 32:09.090
Cut me loose.

32:09.092 --> 32:11.092
We'll go right now
to Grand National.

32:11.094 --> 32:12.927
You just... I'll...

32:12.929 --> 32:15.365
There's nothing I can do
to help you.

32:17.366 --> 32:21.835
You gotta let me go to the bank,
if you want the money, buddy.

32:21.837 --> 32:23.838
Fuck's sake, I just so happens
I don't travel around

32:23.840 --> 32:26.340
with 350 fucking grand cash
in my pocket.

32:26.342 --> 32:27.911
Call your bank.

32:29.813 --> 32:32.479
That's my fucking...

32:32.481 --> 32:34.047
Give me a phone.

32:34.049 --> 32:36.249
Give me a phone.
I'll call 'em.

32:36.251 --> 32:38.486
I don't have one.

32:38.488 --> 32:40.888
What the fuck do you mean,
you don't have a phone?

32:40.890 --> 32:43.091
I have one,
but it's not here with me.

32:43.093 --> 32:44.257
- Why?
- It's at the office

32:44.259 --> 32:47.294
because they are
fucking traceable,

32:47.296 --> 32:50.366
and I was never fucking here,
you genius.

32:57.106 --> 32:59.107
So what then, Andrew?
What...

32:59.109 --> 33:00.975
Why don't you
just get to the point?

33:00.977 --> 33:04.245
Tell me what the fuck
you want.

33:04.247 --> 33:06.450
What is it that you
fucking want? Tell me.

33:08.485 --> 33:10.421
You're clearly here
for a fucking reason.

33:12.788 --> 33:15.922
We politicians have
a bad rap nowadays.

33:15.924 --> 33:18.258
We're accused
of talking too much.

33:18.260 --> 33:21.262
We make no decisions
or the wrong ones.

33:21.264 --> 33:24.332
We spend too much or we don't
develop enough programs.

33:24.334 --> 33:26.333
We don't defend our country,

33:26.335 --> 33:28.002
but we overspend
on the military,

33:28.004 --> 33:29.771
and so forth and so on
and blah blah blah.

33:29.773 --> 33:33.276
You get where I'm going here?

33:36.845 --> 33:38.880
No, and I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

33:38.882 --> 33:43.316
We are accused of having
no accountability.

33:43.318 --> 33:46.019
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

33:46.021 --> 33:49.556
No accountability?
It has to do with everything.

33:49.558 --> 33:52.794
Sooner or later,
we will all be judged

33:52.796 --> 33:55.796
on what we have or what we
have not done during our life.

33:55.798 --> 33:57.265
Fine, I'll give you
10 extra bonus points,

33:57.267 --> 33:59.900
you get me out now,
access to a fucking bonus round!

33:59.902 --> 34:02.136
- What the fuck!
- You're a funny man.

34:02.138 --> 34:05.273
[laughs]
That's funny!

34:05.275 --> 34:08.074
- What the fuck do you want?
- I'll tell you the truth.

34:08.076 --> 34:10.377
I don't give a shit
about the 100K I lost

34:10.379 --> 34:13.246
or the return I never got.

34:13.248 --> 34:17.217
- Then what?
- Acts and consequences.

34:17.219 --> 34:18.221
What?

34:20.924 --> 34:24.826
My opponent ran on
this bullshit platform

34:24.828 --> 34:28.529
of cutting taxes
and lowering costs.

34:28.531 --> 34:30.565
Oh, God, that's crazy.

34:30.567 --> 34:33.533
Cutting taxes, lowering costs,
that sounds...

34:33.534 --> 34:35.235
You fucks have elections
every four years anyway.

34:35.237 --> 34:36.937
It's too fucking late for that.

34:36.938 --> 34:38.908
- God.
- No.

34:41.476 --> 34:44.245
There was a bridge.

34:44.246 --> 34:46.013
It was in bad disrepair.

34:46.014 --> 34:47.848
Needed to be torn down
and rebuilt.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.283
My opponent,
the new administration,

34:50.284 --> 34:52.319
he decided to fix it,

34:52.321 --> 34:55.188
just long enough for it
to last for another four years.

34:55.190 --> 34:58.025
Well, it didn't.

34:58.027 --> 35:00.627
It collapsed six months later,

35:00.629 --> 35:05.232
just as a school bus full of
children were crossing it.

35:05.234 --> 35:08.236
- 23 died!
- You can't blame...

35:08.238 --> 35:13.274
17 families never stopped
mourning their dear angels!

35:13.276 --> 35:15.408
Your logic train just skipped
a few tracks to land there.

35:15.410 --> 35:19.346
If I only had that money,
I'd have won that election

35:19.348 --> 35:21.047
and none of that
would've happened.

35:21.049 --> 35:23.650
How the fuck
do you make that leap?

35:23.652 --> 35:26.120
Are you fucking kidding me?

35:26.122 --> 35:28.355
You can't pin that shit...
I didn't kill anyone!

35:28.357 --> 35:31.958
No, you didn't kill those kids.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.328
You didn't topple that bridge.

35:34.330 --> 35:36.663
You didn't cut the budget,
you didn't lose the election,

35:36.665 --> 35:40.370
but your actions
provoked all the above.

35:42.272 --> 35:44.304
What do you want, Andrew?

35:44.306 --> 35:46.306
What the fuck do you want?
Just tell me.

35:46.308 --> 35:48.275
How much?
It's the money, right?

35:48.277 --> 35:50.210
How much?
Just give me a number.

35:50.212 --> 35:53.446
Stop the bullshit
and give me a fucking number.

35:53.448 --> 35:55.149
Have the fucking balls
to give me a number!

35:55.151 --> 35:57.217
What do you want?
I'll pay you! What?

35:57.219 --> 36:00.254
Oh, you're gonna pay me?
With what?

36:00.256 --> 36:02.556
Money you stole
from other people?

36:02.558 --> 36:04.158
No, no.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.326
Did I really just hear
a politician talk to me

36:06.328 --> 36:08.495
about spending other
people's money?

36:08.497 --> 36:09.996
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

36:09.998 --> 36:11.399
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Fuck you!

36:11.401 --> 36:13.935
I want what you
fucking promised!

36:13.937 --> 36:15.268
Fuck you! Damn it!

36:15.270 --> 36:17.304
- You fucking cut me!
- You promised!

36:17.306 --> 36:20.473
You motherfucking
piece of shit!

36:20.475 --> 36:23.044
Fuck you!

36:23.046 --> 36:24.478
Goddamn it!

36:24.480 --> 36:28.652
STEVE: Goddamn it, you fucker!

36:44.667 --> 36:50.073
[Steve grunting]

36:53.609 --> 36:56.676
[grunting]

36:56.678 --> 36:57.680
Shut up!

36:59.582 --> 37:01.285
Jesus Christ.

37:54.236 --> 37:57.073
Thank you for that,
Mr. Farrel.

38:01.277 --> 38:03.344
It was cathartic.

38:03.346 --> 38:04.281
[flicks lighter]

38:10.752 --> 38:15.121
Nah, I quit
when I stopped drinking.

38:15.123 --> 38:16.660
That's a good idea.

38:19.796 --> 38:21.098
Hey.

38:25.634 --> 38:27.069
And this.

38:30.705 --> 38:31.774
Yeah...

38:42.785 --> 38:45.351
MAN: <i>Where have you been
the last couple of days?</i>

38:45.353 --> 38:49.123
STEVE: <i>It was paperwork.
This is no fucking good.</i>

38:49.125 --> 38:51.728
<i>[voices echoing]</i>

39:00.303 --> 39:01.438
MAN: <i>Don't think about it.</i>

39:12.781 --> 39:14.584
Is he here?

39:19.288 --> 39:20.424
Yeah.

39:21.823 --> 39:25.227
Your fee, as discussed.

39:33.636 --> 39:35.572
You said 25.

39:51.187 --> 39:53.123
How long have I got?

39:58.460 --> 40:00.761
An hour enough?

40:00.763 --> 40:02.699
More than enough.

40:18.647 --> 40:19.850
STEVE: Sonia.

40:21.850 --> 40:23.449
Sonia.

40:23.451 --> 40:26.754
I knew it was you, sweetie.

40:26.756 --> 40:29.455
I always recognize that voice.

40:29.457 --> 40:31.427
Dark in here.

40:35.698 --> 40:37.167
Much better.

40:38.701 --> 40:43.571
Jesus Christ,
you look like shit.

40:43.573 --> 40:46.375
I gotta admit, I'm not having
my best of days, baby.

40:47.777 --> 40:50.678
Well, I always warned you
that someday

40:50.680 --> 40:54.350
your lying and your cheating
would catch up with you.

40:55.685 --> 40:56.951
You paying him?

40:56.953 --> 40:58.451
I don't understand.

40:58.453 --> 41:00.788
Are you paying him
for time with me?

41:00.790 --> 41:02.726
You paying him money?

41:04.826 --> 41:08.696
Please tell me you're not buying
into this fucking craziness.

41:08.698 --> 41:11.431
- What craziness is that?
- Oh, come on.

41:11.433 --> 41:15.236
Lot of bad shit going on in his
life he fucking blames me for.

41:15.238 --> 41:17.937
It has fuck all to do with me.

41:17.939 --> 41:20.910
I can't see how he connects
the fuckin' dots.

41:26.815 --> 41:28.852
Just wanna do right by him.

41:31.254 --> 41:33.254
Just like you did right by me?

41:33.256 --> 41:34.723
[groans]

41:37.692 --> 41:40.027
- God!
- You used to like that.

41:40.029 --> 41:42.263
Or I thought you did anyway.

41:42.265 --> 41:45.201
You know I like it, baby.
I love that shit.

41:46.636 --> 41:50.703
Nobody could ever
fake a dick that hard,

41:50.705 --> 41:52.739
but you know we were always
a temporary thing.

41:52.741 --> 41:53.841
You know that.

41:53.843 --> 41:55.911
I did?

41:57.747 --> 42:00.013
What the fuck you telling me?
Come on.

42:00.015 --> 42:04.817
We're two consenting adults,
and you're fucking married.

42:04.819 --> 42:06.886
You were never gonna
leave Zach.

42:06.888 --> 42:08.657
Christ.

42:17.433 --> 42:21.435
I guess I just got...
mixed signals.

42:21.437 --> 42:24.571
STEVE: <i>Yeah.</i>

42:24.573 --> 42:25.642
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:27.542 --> 42:29.009
Memory Lane.

42:29.011 --> 42:31.982
While I'm tied to
this chair, huh?

42:34.683 --> 42:36.018
Memory Lane.

42:40.422 --> 42:41.757
[screams]

42:43.091 --> 42:44.827
You fucking cunt!

42:46.796 --> 42:49.830
[groans]
Fucking cunt!

42:49.832 --> 42:51.931
Because when you said that
we were leaving for Mauritius,

42:51.933 --> 42:54.801
I actually thought
that you meant us!

42:54.803 --> 42:55.738
[Sonia shouts]

42:58.573 --> 43:00.440
[vomits]

43:00.442 --> 43:03.609
You're fucking insane! God!

43:03.611 --> 43:07.714
No. Insane was thinking
that you actually loved me.

43:07.716 --> 43:09.752
- [stab]
- [groaning]

43:12.922 --> 43:14.654
You know I love you, baby.

43:14.656 --> 43:16.660
Bullshit!

43:20.796 --> 43:23.596
I went to the airport
with ticket in hand

43:23.598 --> 43:25.699
and packed fucking bags

43:25.701 --> 43:28.701
when your husband sent
some visitors to greet me,

43:28.703 --> 43:31.605
and they beat me
into a fucking coma,

43:31.607 --> 43:33.507
you fucking imbecile,

43:33.509 --> 43:37.444
and it took me months
to regain my memory.

43:37.446 --> 43:39.078
God!

43:39.080 --> 43:41.448
[groaning]

43:41.450 --> 43:43.384
Do you still have the money
I gave you?

43:43.386 --> 43:46.819
237 grand,
every fucking nickel.

43:46.821 --> 43:49.455
That's enough for us
to start a life together.

43:49.457 --> 43:51.725
I don't need
your fucking money anymore.

43:51.727 --> 43:54.428
I got my own fucking money.

43:54.430 --> 43:57.433
I always loved you.

44:00.902 --> 44:05.004
Come here, baby, come here.

44:05.006 --> 44:08.040
Let me whisper
something in your ear.

44:08.042 --> 44:09.978
Closer.

44:14.884 --> 44:19.051
We can still do this, sweetie.

44:19.053 --> 44:24.158
We can still have some sand
between our toes and blue ocean.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.725
You like that?

44:25.727 --> 44:27.960
We can do that,
we can do that.

44:27.962 --> 44:30.531
You just, uh...

44:30.533 --> 44:32.969
You just gotta get me
outta here.

44:35.171 --> 44:37.873
That sound like
something you like?

44:39.774 --> 44:42.109
Does that sound like
something you want?

44:42.111 --> 44:44.881
You want that?
Is that what you fucking want?

44:50.819 --> 44:53.987
- Wh-Why?
- Why?

44:53.989 --> 44:56.223
Let's go with the two
fucking holes in my legs.

44:56.225 --> 44:58.091
But really, baby,

44:58.093 --> 45:00.092
it's because I've been
serving you platters of cock

45:00.094 --> 45:02.995
that you don't deserve to be
in the same fucking bed with.

45:02.997 --> 45:05.799
You see, I like you, Sonia,

45:05.801 --> 45:08.938
and you fucking disgust me
at the same time.

45:15.710 --> 45:18.480
Blame it on my hemorrhaging
Madonna-whore complex.

45:44.038 --> 45:45.073
[mumbles]

45:56.551 --> 45:59.588
Okay, Petey,
where you at, faggot?

46:21.210 --> 46:24.113
Oh! Goddamn it!
That's Garvey!

46:28.049 --> 46:29.185
[groans]

46:31.786 --> 46:34.120
[groans]

46:34.122 --> 46:37.493
Oh, buddy,
buddy, buddy, buddy.

46:42.598 --> 46:44.797
Hey there.

46:44.799 --> 46:46.736
You don't look too good,
do you?

46:49.805 --> 46:51.940
Ah, you fucking cunt.

46:54.009 --> 46:56.042
Don't go anywhere, huh?

46:56.044 --> 46:57.611
Gonna take out the trash

46:57.613 --> 47:00.714
before this bitch starts
to stink the place up.

47:00.716 --> 47:02.748
No, no, no,
don't even think about it.

47:02.750 --> 47:05.252
I got this.
You sit tight, all right?

47:05.254 --> 47:07.556
It's the least I could do.

47:10.658 --> 47:12.658
[grunts]

47:12.660 --> 47:14.828
Fucking heavy bitch.
[grunts]

47:14.830 --> 47:16.862
Come on!

47:16.864 --> 47:17.966
[grunts]

47:48.730 --> 47:50.964
You know,
I'll be honest, Sonia,

47:50.966 --> 47:53.065
and I do think we're at
the point in our relationship

47:53.067 --> 47:56.803
where we can be truthful with
each other, don't you agree?

47:56.805 --> 47:57.937
Good.

47:57.939 --> 48:00.741
Glad we're on the same page.

48:00.743 --> 48:03.109
'Cause the truth is, honey, I...

48:03.111 --> 48:05.911
I was never even gonna meet you
to begin with.

48:05.913 --> 48:07.883
Christ, I didn't even
buy the fucking ticket.

48:10.085 --> 48:13.085
Which is weird, you know,
'cause I...

48:13.087 --> 48:15.257
actually like you, sweetie.

48:16.959 --> 48:20.794
You know, therapist says
I always destroy

48:20.796 --> 48:23.029
the things I love.

48:23.031 --> 48:27.734
You know,
fucking therapist says,

48:27.736 --> 48:29.803
I always do damage
to the ones

48:29.805 --> 48:33.306
'cause I'm afraid
of getting hurt,

48:33.308 --> 48:35.174
which would make
perfect sense

48:35.176 --> 48:37.109
if I ever met somebody
that wasn't afraid to get hurt.

48:37.111 --> 48:39.381
Fucking cunt therapist,
you know?

48:45.187 --> 48:47.256
So I guess I just,
I just...

48:48.957 --> 48:53.062
I just wanna know
if you forgive me for this?

48:56.198 --> 48:58.134
Fair enough. Good talk.

49:03.372 --> 49:05.642
[grunting]

49:20.723 --> 49:21.858
[shouts]

49:26.261 --> 49:27.230
Fuck!

51:10.098 --> 51:12.301
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

51:13.535 --> 51:14.935
[gunshot]

51:14.937 --> 51:16.870
Oh, shit!

51:16.872 --> 51:18.473
[Peter groans]

51:33.589 --> 51:37.026
I think you and me
need to go inside.

51:42.997 --> 51:43.999
Now.

51:45.901 --> 51:46.868
[groans]

52:01.649 --> 52:05.051
Right there.
Sit down before you fall down.

52:05.053 --> 52:06.920
You must be loving this.

52:06.922 --> 52:10.193
Oh, yeah, it's how I love
to spend every weekend.

52:12.093 --> 52:13.560
Now tell me this.

52:13.562 --> 52:16.429
You got anything decent
to drink in this shit hole?

52:16.431 --> 52:17.533
Cabinet.

52:19.368 --> 52:21.437
There should be
a bottle of bourbon.

52:27.075 --> 52:29.141
Oh, yeah!

52:29.143 --> 52:31.277
There's my Peter!

52:31.279 --> 52:33.850
Some cheap fucking garbage,
right?

52:35.384 --> 52:36.519
Why don't you...

52:38.921 --> 52:40.319
Why don't you pour that?

52:40.321 --> 52:42.524
My grip's a little weak
right now.

52:48.497 --> 52:50.163
Right there.

52:50.165 --> 52:51.964
Why don't you shoot me
and get it over with?

52:51.966 --> 52:54.199
Oh, for fuck's sake.
If I wanted you dead,

52:54.201 --> 52:56.937
I wouldn't have shot you
in the goddamn leg.

52:56.939 --> 52:58.007
Pour it.

53:17.526 --> 53:19.192
What's wrong, Peter?

53:19.194 --> 53:21.027
What, are you too good
to have a drink

53:21.029 --> 53:22.465
with your old buddy Steve?

53:25.200 --> 53:26.299
I don't drink.

53:26.301 --> 53:28.404
What if I insist?

53:32.640 --> 53:34.341
There you go now.

53:34.343 --> 53:36.109
You're getting into
the spirit of things, huh?

53:36.111 --> 53:37.313
Salud.

53:39.580 --> 53:42.114
Fuck you.
I told you I don't drink.

53:42.116 --> 53:43.952
Ah, yeah.

53:45.620 --> 53:48.087
Well, you see, that's not
what you said downstairs.

53:48.089 --> 53:49.522
See, what you said downstairs,

53:49.524 --> 53:51.623
you said that I drove you
back to the bottle.

53:51.625 --> 53:53.194
That's what you said.

53:56.698 --> 53:59.632
Yeah, but a lot's
happened since then.

53:59.634 --> 54:02.101
- I've changed.
- Oh!

54:02.103 --> 54:05.371
There you go, Saint Peter.
I mean, fuck.

54:05.373 --> 54:07.406
Saint Peter I knew, I mean,
he'd never kidnap somebody,

54:07.408 --> 54:08.641
invite people over
to torture 'em.

54:08.643 --> 54:10.579
That would never happen.

54:12.681 --> 54:14.147
Oh, we're not friends.

54:14.149 --> 54:15.685
Semantics.

54:18.120 --> 54:19.989
Tell me this.

54:22.089 --> 54:24.491
What the fuck
happened in your life

54:24.493 --> 54:27.192
that brought you here
to this table,

54:27.194 --> 54:29.362
with me holding the cord
over your fate?

54:29.364 --> 54:31.100
What the fuck happened to you?

54:32.466 --> 54:33.401
Estelle.

54:35.803 --> 54:37.804
Ah, yeah.

54:37.806 --> 54:40.140
Daddy's little girl, huh?

54:40.142 --> 54:41.540
Tell me, what'd she do?

54:41.542 --> 54:43.342
She do something naughty?

54:43.344 --> 54:46.245
She get out late?
What'd she do?

54:46.247 --> 54:48.781
[groans]

54:48.783 --> 54:51.453
[laughing]

55:03.832 --> 55:07.400
Me and Joan
were fighting all the time.

55:07.402 --> 55:10.139
Mostly about my drinking.

55:11.705 --> 55:13.475
And she worked all day.

55:16.710 --> 55:17.712
I drank.

55:25.786 --> 55:30.623
Estelle was at the mall
with her friends,

55:30.625 --> 55:33.129
and Joan asked me
to go pick her up.

55:40.402 --> 55:42.338
I knew I shouldn't have
stopped for a drink, but...

55:57.718 --> 55:59.551
I never even saw the stop.

55:59.553 --> 56:01.423
[tires screeching]

56:09.663 --> 56:13.535
She went through the windshield
like a rag doll.

56:16.671 --> 56:19.241
And I held her in my arms.

56:20.741 --> 56:23.678
And I told her everything
was gonna be all right.

56:27.681 --> 56:29.685
But I was lying.

56:31.553 --> 56:33.252
There was too much blood.

56:33.254 --> 56:35.190
I knew everything
wasn't gonna be all right.

56:40.227 --> 56:43.398
She died before the paramedics
even got there.

56:52.174 --> 56:54.574
Why, I'm...

56:54.576 --> 56:57.377
sorry for your loss, Peter,

56:57.379 --> 56:58.747
but fuck you!

57:00.549 --> 57:01.584
And what, that's all...

57:03.685 --> 57:05.884
That's all my fault, huh?

57:05.886 --> 57:08.288
It's my fault you invested
in the film business, huh?

57:08.290 --> 57:11.757
Which requires balls,
you fucking pussy!

57:11.759 --> 57:13.859
It's my fault you bought
into the bullshit?

57:13.861 --> 57:15.895
It's my fault
you didn't listen to me?

57:15.897 --> 57:18.834
It's my fault you believe
in Santa Claus? Fuck you!

57:20.234 --> 57:22.801
You're gonna need those.

57:22.803 --> 57:26.538
Sooner or later, I'm gonna need
to use both of my hands.

57:26.540 --> 57:29.241
Forgive me, but I just don't
trust you to cooperate.

57:29.243 --> 57:31.377
[chuckles]

57:31.379 --> 57:34.650
I know. It's my own fucking
insecurity, right?

57:36.850 --> 57:38.786
Zip tie your ankles.

57:56.837 --> 57:59.307
I hope you don't me
using your minutes.

58:08.616 --> 58:10.252
[ringing]

58:11.518 --> 58:13.254
[ringing continues]

58:19.426 --> 58:21.627
- Rose, baby.
- <i>Oh, fuck, baby.</i>

58:21.629 --> 58:23.429
<i>Baby, I was worried to death.</i>

58:23.431 --> 58:24.696
<i>Are you okay? Talk to me.</i>

58:24.698 --> 58:27.366
Yeah, I know
it sounded scary.

58:27.368 --> 58:29.835
No, yeah, misunderstanding.

58:29.837 --> 58:33.739
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor. Can ya?

58:33.741 --> 58:36.308
I need you
to come and pick me up.

58:36.310 --> 58:37.877
Take this down.
Got a pen?

58:37.879 --> 58:41.413
Of course I can, baby.
Just tell me where.

58:41.415 --> 58:46.451
876 Brown Road, 78622.

58:46.453 --> 58:47.886
<i>You got it down?</i>

58:47.888 --> 58:50.790
I got it, baby.
I'll be there as fast as I can.

58:50.792 --> 58:52.357
Do you need me
to call the police?

58:52.359 --> 58:54.627
No, no, no.
I got it all under control.

58:54.629 --> 58:56.828
Rose, Rose...

58:56.830 --> 58:59.498
wear those red panties, baby.

58:59.500 --> 59:01.500
<i>I'm gonna need to fuck you.</i>

59:01.502 --> 59:04.439
I'll wear your favorite panties.
Don't worry, baby.

59:10.678 --> 59:12.680
[printer whirring]

59:27.928 --> 59:29.797
Is this your place?

59:31.899 --> 59:34.000
No.

59:34.002 --> 59:36.402
It belongs to Joan's family.

59:36.404 --> 59:37.670
This is nice.

59:37.672 --> 59:40.073
You should think
about moving out here.

59:40.075 --> 59:42.074
It's peaceful, you know?

59:42.076 --> 59:44.944
It might be good for you,
you know?

59:44.946 --> 59:47.946
Put your hands
behind your back.

59:47.948 --> 59:50.018
Hands behind your back.

59:55.589 --> 59:57.357
You know,
if you were out here,

59:57.359 --> 01:00:00.960
I think you could
use the time to evaluate

01:00:00.962 --> 01:00:03.995
all that shit you've been
carrying with you, you know?

01:00:03.997 --> 01:00:06.466
That bad feeling.

01:00:06.468 --> 01:00:09.969
I know it's not healthy
to keep that shit bottled up.

01:00:09.971 --> 01:00:11.837
Buddy, don't get me wrong.

01:00:11.839 --> 01:00:15.007
I understand, you know,
you losing your daughter.

01:00:15.009 --> 01:00:17.009
Oh, no,
fucking hell, I mean,

01:00:17.011 --> 01:00:19.145
it was your own fault
for being a goddamn alcoholic.

01:00:19.147 --> 01:00:23.815
Fuck, I mean, that would
fuck me up too, right?

01:00:23.817 --> 01:00:25.620
Jesus Christ.

01:00:28.689 --> 01:00:30.625
PETER: You really don't see it,
do you?

01:00:34.763 --> 01:00:36.929
You ruined every life
that you touched.

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:38.765
Ruined?

01:00:38.767 --> 01:00:41.167
Fuck off.
I try to help people.

01:00:41.169 --> 01:00:43.571
I try to improve
their situation.

01:00:47.609 --> 01:00:49.942
You're out of
your fucking mind.

01:00:49.944 --> 01:00:52.111
Let me tell you something.

01:00:52.113 --> 01:00:54.147
That's really rich, coming from
the guy that wrote a script

01:00:54.149 --> 01:00:56.516
about a kidnapping
he's actually carrying out.

01:00:56.518 --> 01:00:58.817
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
I read that shit,

01:00:58.819 --> 01:01:01.187
and it's fucking glorious!

01:01:01.189 --> 01:01:02.623
Tell me this though.

01:01:03.825 --> 01:01:05.491
Tell me this.

01:01:05.493 --> 01:01:07.460
Do you and I
need an agreement?

01:01:07.462 --> 01:01:09.027
You know, because
I'm actually in the story.

01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:11.663
Like life rights.
I think we do.

01:01:11.665 --> 01:01:13.132
But we'll get back to that,
all right?

01:01:13.134 --> 01:01:15.704
You're gonna kill me.
Just get it over with.

01:01:17.205 --> 01:01:21.507
Despite everything
we've been through,

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:23.975
I really think you and I
can be friends,

01:01:23.977 --> 01:01:27.115
and I also need you
to get my money back.

01:01:28.982 --> 01:01:30.549
[Peter groans]

01:01:30.551 --> 01:01:32.819
That doesn't feel good,
does it?

01:01:32.821 --> 01:01:35.487
[panting]

01:01:35.489 --> 01:01:37.526
You'll feel much better here.

01:01:50.471 --> 01:01:52.804
Look at that, Pete.

01:01:52.806 --> 01:01:54.843
Oh, shit.

01:01:57.978 --> 01:02:00.480
You're gonna be all right.

01:02:00.482 --> 01:02:02.748
I actually think that hurt you
more than it hurt me.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.150
Oh, fuck you.

01:02:04.152 --> 01:02:08.154
You really don't like me,
do you?

01:02:08.156 --> 01:02:10.723
I'm glad that's starting
to sink in.

01:02:10.725 --> 01:02:12.225
Ah, luckily enough,

01:02:12.227 --> 01:02:14.696
we don't have
to like each other.

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:25.170
Okay, if you would be
so kind, sir,

01:02:25.172 --> 01:02:27.475
I'm gonna need your password.

01:02:32.747 --> 01:02:33.882
Fuck yourself.

01:02:35.283 --> 01:02:38.886
"Fuck yourself."
Let's give it a try.

01:02:42.089 --> 01:02:44.723
Okay.

01:02:44.725 --> 01:02:47.726
Well, let's see
who's showing up next.

01:02:47.728 --> 01:02:49.261
Come on, buddy,
it's your guest list.

01:02:49.263 --> 01:02:50.498
Who's next?

01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:54.734
Ms. Ellis, is she next?

01:02:54.736 --> 01:02:56.067
Come on, old buddy.

01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:58.837
She's not coming.

01:02:58.839 --> 01:02:59.938
Refused the invite, huh?

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.775
Fucking attagirl, Ms. Ellis.

01:03:02.777 --> 01:03:05.044
See? Not everybody is blaming me
for their fuck-ups.

01:03:05.046 --> 01:03:08.948
No, she wanted to come.

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:11.716
She's in Australia
on business.

01:03:11.718 --> 01:03:13.920
Well, that leaves Lou and Mike.

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:17.526
I spoke to Mike this morning,
so it must be Lou, right?

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.530
Hey, you know
I know it was Lou.

01:03:25.098 --> 01:03:28.701
It's fuckin' Lou.

01:03:28.703 --> 01:03:30.005
Well...

01:03:31.906 --> 01:03:34.910
You and I are gonna be
ready for him, aren't we?

01:03:39.314 --> 01:03:43.114
What time is he arriving?

01:03:43.116 --> 01:03:45.286
What time is it now?

01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:50.225
It's quarter past two.

01:03:52.826 --> 01:03:54.830
He's late.

01:03:56.263 --> 01:03:58.901
Yeah, that's Lou, all right.

01:04:04.973 --> 01:04:07.373
Hey, Petey,

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:11.743
I ever tell you about
the time I met Lou Michaels?

01:04:11.745 --> 01:04:15.214
Fucker was just getting
started in real estate, right?

01:04:15.216 --> 01:04:19.719
A ton of fucking cash,
not a molecule of confidence.

01:04:19.721 --> 01:04:22.821
And he needed me

01:04:22.823 --> 01:04:26.058
to find him a piece
of commercial real estate

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.230
for this mall project.

01:04:29.397 --> 01:04:31.096
And I wanted to help him,

01:04:31.098 --> 01:04:34.266
just like I wanted
to help you, you know?

01:04:34.268 --> 01:04:36.838
I like people.
I'm a people person.

01:04:41.308 --> 01:04:42.977
[gun clicking]

01:05:13.908 --> 01:05:15.810
[panting]

01:06:13.868 --> 01:06:16.000
Fuck.

01:06:16.002 --> 01:06:17.705
LOU: Farrel.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:25.978
This isn't a good time.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:29.080
[chuckles]
I can see that.

01:06:29.082 --> 01:06:31.018
You look like shit.

01:06:32.754 --> 01:06:35.790
And this is exactly the time
you told me to be here.

01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:42.161
Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Michaels.

01:06:42.163 --> 01:06:45.397
Plans have changed.

01:06:45.399 --> 01:06:47.199
Uh-uh.

01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.067
After our last conversation,

01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:52.239
you assured me everything
was good, Farrel.

01:06:55.276 --> 01:06:57.777
I paid your fee in advance,
as agreed.

01:06:57.779 --> 01:07:00.449
I want what I paid for.
A deal's a deal.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:07.421
I suggest you take me
to see Walsh, huh?

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.460
He's dead.

01:07:14.462 --> 01:07:16.962
He what?

01:07:16.964 --> 01:07:18.563
He...

01:07:18.565 --> 01:07:20.232
is...

01:07:20.234 --> 01:07:22.002
dead!

01:07:24.038 --> 01:07:26.038
Hmm.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.040
You telling me
I paid good money

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:30.475
to put a beating
on that son of a bitch,

01:07:30.477 --> 01:07:32.413
and now he's dead?

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:36.451
[laughs]

01:07:38.051 --> 01:07:39.854
I gotta see this.

01:07:45.091 --> 01:07:47.027
You're fucking kidding me.

01:07:50.964 --> 01:07:52.767
Okay.

01:08:00.942 --> 01:08:02.277
Down here.

01:08:04.578 --> 01:08:07.783
[Peter groans]

01:08:12.853 --> 01:08:15.290
- Is this some kinda joke?
- He's right there.

01:08:23.397 --> 01:08:27.533
You're gonna kill a man, Pete,
you gotta make sure he's dead.

01:08:27.535 --> 01:08:29.470
Just an FYI.

01:08:54.562 --> 01:08:56.095
Fuck.

01:08:57.564 --> 01:08:59.663
You mind if I smoke
these things?

01:08:59.666 --> 01:09:03.301
'Cause my body is
a fucking temple.

01:09:03.304 --> 01:09:05.904
Take his belt off.

01:09:05.907 --> 01:09:09.341
Tie his arms out of the way.

01:09:09.343 --> 01:09:12.345
We don't want this fool
putting up a fight, do we, Pete?

01:09:25.326 --> 01:09:28.095
I'm glad to see
he's still alive.

01:09:31.599 --> 01:09:34.035
PETER: What are you
planning on doing now?

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:38.270
You know, at first,
I really wanted to kill him,

01:09:38.272 --> 01:09:41.673
but I've had
a change of heart. I...

01:09:41.675 --> 01:09:44.209
I think he's worth more alive,

01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:46.176
and it gives me an opportunity
to negotiate with him,

01:09:46.179 --> 01:09:49.180
which you can help me do.

01:09:49.183 --> 01:09:52.584
And what if I said...

01:09:52.586 --> 01:09:56.088
Fuck you!

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:59.294
Then I shoot you
in the fucking face.

01:10:00.627 --> 01:10:02.194
[sighs]

01:10:02.196 --> 01:10:06.134
Okay, we ready to get started?

01:10:07.367 --> 01:10:09.603
- Absolutely.
- Attaboy.

01:10:13.306 --> 01:10:14.541
[grunts]

01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:26.418
What the fuck's going on?

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.419
You said he was dead.

01:10:28.421 --> 01:10:32.357
You know, I think Mark Twain
actually said it best,

01:10:32.359 --> 01:10:34.026
something to the effect of

01:10:34.028 --> 01:10:36.628
"the reports of my death
have been greatly exaggerated."

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:40.499
I don't know if it's actually,
but you get the point.

01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:46.271
I look like shit, but you can
see that I'm alive and kicking.

01:10:46.273 --> 01:10:50.342
And, Lou, I don't think you'd be
too surprised to find out

01:10:50.344 --> 01:10:55.317
that I'm pretty upset
with you, buddy.

01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:59.019
You shot me.

01:11:01.054 --> 01:11:06.091
I did, and that's normally
not something I would do.

01:11:06.093 --> 01:11:08.093
See, Lou, I don't think you
came here to cuddle with me,

01:11:08.095 --> 01:11:10.094
did you, buddy?

01:11:10.096 --> 01:11:12.597
It turns out
our brand of loyalties,

01:11:12.599 --> 01:11:16.301
and that really fucking
hurts my feelings, Lou.

01:11:16.303 --> 01:11:17.703
You son of a bitch, Walsh.

01:11:17.705 --> 01:11:19.370
- See, I like that.
- What do you want?

01:11:19.372 --> 01:11:21.205
See, that's what I like
about you, Lou.

01:11:21.207 --> 01:11:22.807
Full fucking throttle.

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:25.610
It's all business, buddy.
You're a cross-dresser,

01:11:25.612 --> 01:11:27.279
you get the motherfucking
sex tape!

01:11:27.281 --> 01:11:29.114
That's what you do, Lou!

01:11:29.116 --> 01:11:34.085
Yeah, and you've always loved
flapping your lips.

01:11:34.087 --> 01:11:36.088
Touché.

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:38.089
And he's right, you know?

01:11:38.091 --> 01:11:41.259
My therapist says I have
a sort of emotional Tourette's.

01:11:41.261 --> 01:11:43.262
LOU: You ask me for money?

01:11:43.264 --> 01:11:47.298
STEVE: I don't ask anybody
for anything but the time, so...

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.102
Nah. You just love
hearing the sound

01:11:50.104 --> 01:11:52.170
of your own
bullshit-spouting voice.

01:11:52.172 --> 01:11:56.174
Well, that may be, you know,

01:11:56.176 --> 01:11:58.145
but I'm gonna tell you
just like I told her.

01:11:59.746 --> 01:12:03.449
You never get to a point
during the fucking,

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:06.285
where they control the pace
and the depth.

01:12:06.287 --> 01:12:08.719
[Lou screams]
Fuck!

01:12:08.721 --> 01:12:10.657
[groaning]

01:12:24.104 --> 01:12:26.105
What do you want, Walsh?

01:12:26.107 --> 01:12:29.740
You know, buddy...

01:12:29.742 --> 01:12:32.210
this might surprise you, but...

01:12:32.212 --> 01:12:33.744
but I am in a bit of
a financial situation

01:12:33.746 --> 01:12:36.615
that I'm hoping you
can help me out with.

01:12:36.617 --> 01:12:37.619
[Lou scoffs]

01:12:39.487 --> 01:12:41.552
Y-You're asking me for money?

01:12:41.554 --> 01:12:44.255
I don't ask anybody
for money, Lou.

01:12:44.257 --> 01:12:47.159
I'm inquiring about your desire
to invest with me,

01:12:47.161 --> 01:12:48.526
and you should consider it
an investment.

01:12:48.528 --> 01:12:51.362
Think very long
and hard about it

01:12:51.364 --> 01:12:54.501
'cause it secures
your future in this world.

01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:59.640
Go fuck yourself.

01:13:00.907 --> 01:13:03.374
[exhales]

01:13:03.376 --> 01:13:07.548
Well, it looks like you need
some bit of persuading.

01:13:22.529 --> 01:13:25.297
I don't know how
he's talked you around,

01:13:25.299 --> 01:13:27.466
but whatever's
he's offered you...

01:13:27.468 --> 01:13:29.770
He's the one with
the gun, asshole.

01:13:31.705 --> 01:13:33.871
STEVE: Hit him in his knee.

01:13:33.873 --> 01:13:35.707
Hit him in his knee,
I swear to God,

01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:39.279
I'll shoot you both
in the fucking balls.

01:13:42.349 --> 01:13:43.585
Fucking moron.

01:13:45.219 --> 01:13:47.721
[screaming]

01:13:55.461 --> 01:13:59.431
You got a beautiful wife, Lou.

01:13:59.433 --> 01:14:03.569
And your daughter, she's...
she's precious, buddy.

01:14:03.571 --> 01:14:06.704
Leave my family out of this.

01:14:06.706 --> 01:14:10.575
I will leave your family
out of it, Lou. You got my word.

01:14:10.577 --> 01:14:12.578
You know,
it's the one part of you

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:15.446
that I'm actually jealous of

01:14:15.448 --> 01:14:17.516
'cause I don't have one myself,
you know?

01:14:17.518 --> 01:14:19.383
But I've read about them
in books,

01:14:19.385 --> 01:14:25.824
and they seem like a pretty
wonderful thing to be a part of.

01:14:25.826 --> 01:14:28.459
We don't have to do this, buddy.

01:14:28.461 --> 01:14:31.896
Just transfer the funds
into my account, and we're done.

01:14:31.898 --> 01:14:35.633
Simple business transaction.

01:14:35.635 --> 01:14:38.270
- Never gonna happen, Walsh.
- Oh, it's gonna happen.

01:14:38.272 --> 01:14:39.905
You want me tell you
why it's gonna happen?

01:14:39.907 --> 01:14:41.505
Because phonies like you

01:14:41.507 --> 01:14:44.412
always put self-preservation
above loyalty.

01:14:46.779 --> 01:14:48.280
Hit him again.

01:14:48.282 --> 01:14:50.518
Just give him what he wants.

01:14:53.354 --> 01:14:55.290
Hit him again!

01:14:56.523 --> 01:14:59.524
I'm not gonna say it again.

01:14:59.526 --> 01:15:01.261
Fucking moron.

01:15:02.496 --> 01:15:04.596
[screams]

01:15:04.598 --> 01:15:05.700
Fucking...

01:15:18.711 --> 01:15:20.380
Password, Lou.

01:15:21.814 --> 01:15:23.914
I can't.
Not that account, Walsh.

01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:25.886
Hit him again.

01:15:29.322 --> 01:15:31.455
[groaning]

01:15:31.457 --> 01:15:32.826
Harder!

01:15:34.761 --> 01:15:36.727
[groans]
Fuck!

01:15:36.729 --> 01:15:38.565
Password!

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.402
There it is.
There's that point.

01:15:44.404 --> 01:15:46.405
Tell me again about
how fucking loyal you are.

01:15:46.407 --> 01:15:48.507
Tell me again about
how fucking ethical you are,

01:15:48.509 --> 01:15:50.676
how different you are
than me

01:15:50.678 --> 01:15:54.679
'cause we're about to find out
if you're a fucking phony.

01:15:54.681 --> 01:15:56.515
- [gunshot]
- [Lou screams]

01:15:56.517 --> 01:16:00.651
[groaning]

01:16:00.653 --> 01:16:03.424
[panting]

01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:12.830
Hey, buddy.

01:16:12.832 --> 01:16:16.634
I don't wanna have
to do that again.

01:16:16.636 --> 01:16:17.869
Give me a password.

01:16:17.871 --> 01:16:19.440
[Lou clears throat]

01:16:23.376 --> 01:16:26.645
Four, five...

01:16:26.647 --> 01:16:30.816
G, X...

01:16:30.818 --> 01:16:32.754
six, seven...

01:16:34.987 --> 01:16:36.655
[grunts]

01:16:36.657 --> 01:16:37.722
Fuck.

01:16:37.724 --> 01:16:41.093
K, N...

01:16:41.095 --> 01:16:42.063
21.

01:16:45.765 --> 01:16:48.133
Well, there you go, buddy.

01:16:48.135 --> 01:16:50.668
Round one goes
to self-preservation.

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:52.670
Now, see, this is the shit

01:16:52.672 --> 01:16:54.940
that I can't wrap
my fucking head around.

01:16:54.942 --> 01:16:57.676
You came all the way out here
for a $60,000 land deal

01:16:57.678 --> 01:16:59.444
that went sideways
10 fucking years ago,

01:16:59.446 --> 01:17:02.880
has $3 million sitting
in his account unattended to.

01:17:02.882 --> 01:17:07.151
I told you.
I told you it's not my money.

01:17:07.153 --> 01:17:10.121
That land deal never was
any good, and you know it.

01:17:10.123 --> 01:17:11.923
You lied about
the planning consent,

01:17:11.925 --> 01:17:14.493
and like an idiot,
I bought into it.

01:17:14.495 --> 01:17:16.093
You see, I don't like
hearing that shit.

01:17:16.095 --> 01:17:19.431
You have no idea what it takes
to put a deal together.

01:17:19.433 --> 01:17:22.066
You can't wrap your
fucking head around it.

01:17:22.068 --> 01:17:24.770
Does anybody ever offer me
any gratitude

01:17:24.772 --> 01:17:27.138
or shake my hand like
a fucking gentleman?

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.807
No one does.

01:17:29.809 --> 01:17:31.442
Well, I'll tell you
something else.

01:17:31.444 --> 01:17:35.116
That land permit, Lou,
was guaranteed to me.

01:17:36.716 --> 01:17:38.717
And how did it turn out?

01:17:38.719 --> 01:17:41.485
Yeah, and I take that personal
failing every single day,

01:17:41.487 --> 01:17:43.487
while you fucks
run for the trees.

01:17:43.489 --> 01:17:45.557
Whatever hurdle pops up
in front of me,

01:17:45.559 --> 01:17:48.093
I jump over,
and I search for profit.

01:17:48.095 --> 01:17:52.062
But you fucks
are running home crying.

01:17:52.064 --> 01:17:55.066
Let's do a little
calculation here, shall we?

01:17:55.068 --> 01:17:58.003
Taking into consideration
lost wages,

01:17:58.005 --> 01:18:01.705
personal trauma,
billable hours,

01:18:01.707 --> 01:18:04.678
I don't know, seem like
a fair price to you?

01:18:06.112 --> 01:18:09.614
I can't.
Antolini will kill me.

01:18:09.616 --> 01:18:12.083
Oh, come on, I'm leaving you
with a quarter-million dollars.

01:18:12.085 --> 01:18:14.084
That's plenty enough money
for you to disappear.

01:18:14.086 --> 01:18:16.954
You can go and fucking hide,
long before he finds out

01:18:16.956 --> 01:18:20.459
you tried to shove
a little cock up his butt.

01:18:20.461 --> 01:18:22.761
He's gonna kill you
no matter what you do.

01:18:22.763 --> 01:18:24.929
STEVE: I'd appreciate
some silence here.

01:18:24.931 --> 01:18:28.900
I'm trying to have
a conversation.

01:18:28.902 --> 01:18:31.936
You take that money,
Antolini will come after you

01:18:31.938 --> 01:18:34.905
right after he's put
a bullet in my head.

01:18:34.907 --> 01:18:39.710
You see, I'm gonna let you both
in on a little secret.

01:18:39.712 --> 01:18:42.713
Antolini is gonna
come after me anyway,

01:18:42.715 --> 01:18:46.084
as soon as he realizes the
Dubai land deal fell through,

01:18:46.086 --> 01:18:48.820
even though I have a wonderful
contingency program.

01:18:48.822 --> 01:18:51.890
But just like you, that fat fuck
wouldn't jog towards a profit

01:18:51.892 --> 01:18:54.793
if it meant he's gonna
break a fucking sweat.

01:18:54.795 --> 01:18:56.727
You're fucking crazy.

01:18:56.729 --> 01:18:58.096
[Lou groans]

01:18:58.098 --> 01:18:59.931
I'll tell you this though.

01:18:59.933 --> 01:19:02.601
After you've transferred
the funds,

01:19:02.603 --> 01:19:04.869
I'll be rich, and I'll be crazy,
which is good

01:19:04.871 --> 01:19:07.105
because I'm gonna need
some surgical procedures.

01:19:07.107 --> 01:19:10.141
You see, I seem to be missing
one of my favorite fingers

01:19:10.143 --> 01:19:11.712
right there.

01:19:14.147 --> 01:19:16.114
Your both as good
as fucking dead.

01:19:16.116 --> 01:19:18.149
STEVE: You again.

01:19:18.151 --> 01:19:21.652
The only reason I'm here is
because you couldn't accept

01:19:21.654 --> 01:19:23.954
your own personal
fucking failings.

01:19:23.956 --> 01:19:27.959
There's "loser" written
all over your fucking DNA.

01:19:27.961 --> 01:19:30.765
Why don't you keep
your fucking mouth shut?

01:19:34.968 --> 01:19:37.936
So, Lou...

01:19:37.938 --> 01:19:39.905
where to, buddy?

01:19:39.907 --> 01:19:44.609
I'm gonna need
a confirmation code.

01:19:44.611 --> 01:19:46.781
You don't wanna do this, Walsh.

01:19:48.681 --> 01:19:50.915
There's some cash
back at the office.

01:19:50.917 --> 01:19:52.950
It's not three million, but...

01:19:52.952 --> 01:19:57.289
And loyalty took an early leave.
That's good.

01:19:57.291 --> 01:20:00.158
It's not how I think
it's gonna end up, but...

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.293
So tell me this.

01:20:02.295 --> 01:20:04.995
What kind of value
do you place on your life?

01:20:04.997 --> 01:20:08.799
- What?
- The money back at the safe,

01:20:08.801 --> 01:20:11.302
is there enough in there
to buy your life?

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:14.004
Shit, I don't know.

01:20:14.006 --> 01:20:18.709
Because if the amount doesn't
match what's on that screen,

01:20:18.711 --> 01:20:20.982
I need a confirmation code.

01:20:22.683 --> 01:20:24.618
You're gonna let him do this?

01:20:28.854 --> 01:20:31.323
So I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret, Lou.

01:20:31.325 --> 01:20:33.057
He's actually helping me.

01:20:33.059 --> 01:20:34.926
- Go fuck yourself.
- Ooh!

01:20:34.928 --> 01:20:36.927
There's the head of those balls
I was talking about right there.

01:20:36.929 --> 01:20:39.830
If you find them, hang onto them
'cause you're gonna need them.

01:20:39.832 --> 01:20:41.165
'Cause I feel like
self-preservation's

01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:43.634
making a strong comeback!

01:20:43.636 --> 01:20:45.904
Pick up the pliers.

01:20:45.906 --> 01:20:48.039
Pick up the fucking pliers
right now.

01:20:48.041 --> 01:20:51.045
I'm not gonna say it again.
Pick the fucking pliers up!

01:20:54.113 --> 01:20:59.718
Steve, there's $200,000
in cash sitting upstairs.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.018
You don't need to do this.

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:03.221
What the fuck do you know
what I need?

01:21:03.223 --> 01:21:05.723
What makes you think
you know anything about me?

01:21:05.725 --> 01:21:07.691
Maybe it's not about
the money anymore.

01:21:07.693 --> 01:21:09.227
Maybe it's about the fact
that you drug me out here

01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:11.195
so you could watch others
take out their anger on me

01:21:11.197 --> 01:21:15.400
'cause you don't have the balls
to do it face-to-fucking-face.

01:21:15.402 --> 01:21:17.235
Put the gun down,
we'll go fucking now.

01:21:17.237 --> 01:21:19.404
No shit, fucking tough guy.

01:21:19.406 --> 01:21:21.239
If you ever found the balls
to talk to me,

01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:23.807
your vagina would
swallow them whole.

01:21:23.809 --> 01:21:25.243
I'm gonna count to five.

01:21:25.245 --> 01:21:26.844
If I don't get
a confirmation code,

01:21:26.846 --> 01:21:28.346
you're gonna take those pliers,

01:21:28.348 --> 01:21:30.315
and you're gonna remove
a molar from his mandible.

01:21:30.317 --> 01:21:32.316
- One!
- No!

01:21:32.318 --> 01:21:34.119
- Two!
- Get the fuck away from me.

01:21:34.121 --> 01:21:36.053
I need those four numbers, Lou!

01:21:36.055 --> 01:21:37.989
- Three!
- Just fucking shoot me, man!

01:21:37.991 --> 01:21:39.923
- Four!
- Get the fuck away from me!

01:21:39.925 --> 01:21:41.793
- Just give him what he wants.
- I can't!

01:21:41.795 --> 01:21:43.794
- Five! Pull it!
- God damn you!

01:21:43.796 --> 01:21:46.097
- Pull it!
- Don't make me do this.

01:21:46.099 --> 01:21:48.732
Farrel, don't fucking do it.

01:21:48.734 --> 01:21:51.205
Don't... Don't you fucking dare.

01:21:53.105 --> 01:21:55.041
[screaming]

01:22:04.751 --> 01:22:05.786
[spits]

01:22:15.429 --> 01:22:18.366
I'm gonna need
a confirmation code, Lou.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.002
I don't wanna do it too.

01:22:23.903 --> 01:22:26.070
Six...

01:22:26.072 --> 01:22:28.239
eight...

01:22:28.241 --> 01:22:30.741
two...

01:22:30.743 --> 01:22:32.177
nine.

01:22:32.179 --> 01:22:33.913
6-8-2-9.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:43.754
You know, this always
amazes me, you know?

01:22:43.756 --> 01:22:46.825
It's the heat from my finger
on the screen.

01:22:46.827 --> 01:22:48.696
When I touch it...

01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:53.733
I just became almost
$3 million richer.

01:22:55.001 --> 01:22:56.834
[chuckles]

01:22:56.836 --> 01:22:59.937
Self-preservation, buddy.

01:22:59.939 --> 01:23:03.176
Reigning, defending, undisputed.

01:23:06.513 --> 01:23:08.112
Thank you, Lou.

01:23:08.114 --> 01:23:11.285
Antolini's gonna kill me.

01:23:26.198 --> 01:23:28.134
You want some help
with that, buddy?

01:23:47.053 --> 01:23:48.221
[click]

01:23:52.259 --> 01:23:53.194
[gunshot]

01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:07.373
That script on your laptop
I found on your computer.

01:24:11.178 --> 01:24:12.576
What about it?

01:24:12.578 --> 01:24:14.846
Are you still
planning on doing it?

01:24:14.848 --> 01:24:16.380
I mean, 'cause if you are,
I know a guy,

01:24:16.382 --> 01:24:17.848
funds that type of film.

01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:19.316
It's all he does,
night and day.

01:24:19.318 --> 01:24:21.388
I mean, if you're
still interested.

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:25.957
Are you seriously fucking
asking me that?

01:24:25.959 --> 01:24:27.424
Well, why would you
fucking write it

01:24:27.426 --> 01:24:28.993
if you don't plan
on making it into a movie?

01:24:28.995 --> 01:24:30.997
That makes no fucking sense.

01:24:34.134 --> 01:24:35.368
My sponsor.

01:24:37.437 --> 01:24:39.838
Your sponsor.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.207
Yeah.

01:24:42.209 --> 01:24:45.610
After the crash,
I joined the AA.

01:24:45.612 --> 01:24:48.879
My sponsor thought writing
about it would give me closure,

01:24:48.881 --> 01:24:51.018
keep me from drinking.

01:24:53.953 --> 01:24:55.989
Yeah, I guess
that makes sense.

01:24:58.058 --> 01:24:59.591
But tell me this.

01:24:59.593 --> 01:25:01.625
Whose idea was it
to act it out, huh?

01:25:01.627 --> 01:25:04.430
I'm taking it
that's all you, right?

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.569
Yeah, that was all me.

01:25:13.639 --> 01:25:16.007
It's funny.

01:25:16.009 --> 01:25:18.575
Once I started writing,

01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:22.112
I couldn't help but imagine
doing all these things to you.

01:25:22.114 --> 01:25:24.348
Oh, I bet there's all kinda
things you wanna do to me.

01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:26.420
Is that right?

01:25:33.158 --> 01:25:35.094
Fill that shit up.

01:25:56.448 --> 01:26:00.183
Yeah. There's those balls
I was talking about.

01:26:00.185 --> 01:26:02.286
Reach down there
and give them a squeeze.

01:26:02.288 --> 01:26:04.224
Hey, brother,
you're making me...

01:27:10.255 --> 01:27:14.359
Daddy wanted to be here,
baby girl,

01:27:14.361 --> 01:27:17.328
but he's busy.

01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:19.763
[sighs]

01:27:19.765 --> 01:27:22.169
He says he's writing again.

01:27:24.237 --> 01:27:25.706
I hope he is.

01:27:27.139 --> 01:27:29.343
It'll be good for him.

01:28:09.681 --> 01:28:13.817
All of your friends
miss you so much.

01:28:13.819 --> 01:28:17.023
I love you so much,
baby girl.

01:29:01.334 --> 01:29:02.603
Peter.

01:29:07.172 --> 01:29:08.509
[sobbing]

01:29:25.892 --> 01:29:28.528
[keyboard clicking]

01:29:52.919 --> 01:29:54.755
[groaning]

01:29:56.555 --> 01:30:00.493
[keyboard clicking]

01:30:02.729 --> 01:30:05.562
- [groaning]
- ROSE: Fuck, Steve?

01:30:05.564 --> 01:30:07.798
Steve?

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.267
Oh, my God, baby.

01:30:09.269 --> 01:30:11.302
- Rosie?
- Fuck.

01:30:11.304 --> 01:30:12.637
- Oh, my God.
- Rosie, baby!

01:30:12.639 --> 01:30:14.271
Hey, hey, I'm here.

01:30:14.273 --> 01:30:15.673
Babe, you gotta
get me outta here.

01:30:15.675 --> 01:30:17.508
Okay, okay, I'm gonna
take care of you.

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:18.910
- You're fine, you're fine.
- Okay.

01:30:18.912 --> 01:30:20.645
[groaning]

01:30:20.647 --> 01:30:22.312
Oh, my God.

01:30:22.314 --> 01:30:24.347
There's just something...

01:30:24.349 --> 01:30:25.850
There's something
about you, okay...

01:30:25.852 --> 01:30:28.619
- Rosie!
- That I can't resist.

01:30:28.621 --> 01:30:30.788
- Ah, Rosie!
- All these prints.

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:34.191
Listen, baby, baby, baby,
listen to me.

01:30:34.193 --> 01:30:37.427
Listen to me, baby.
No, listen.

01:30:37.429 --> 01:30:40.364
I swear to God, I'll fuck
the cat lick right out of you,

01:30:40.366 --> 01:30:42.232
as soon as I get better, baby.

01:30:42.234 --> 01:30:45.369
I can't, I can't.
It hurts,

01:30:45.371 --> 01:30:48.673
Hurts.
[groans]

01:30:48.675 --> 01:30:50.374
Baby, no.

01:30:50.376 --> 01:30:52.343
[groans]
