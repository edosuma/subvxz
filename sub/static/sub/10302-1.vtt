01:17.000 --> 01:22.313
And in science news, researchers say
it may be true that after several years...

01:22.520 --> 01:26.832
...dogs and their masters
begin to look alik e.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.991
Yeah, right.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.477
Hi, son.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.628
Over here, Mom.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.318
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.597
Your father'll be home soon,
and he'll be looking for dinner.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.149
Tell him I hope he finds it.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.678
I'm just going over to Marcie's.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.638
But you'll miss
Dad's latest episode...

01:56.840 --> 01:59.229
...of A Fat Woman Came
into the Shoe Store Today.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.672
Actually, I already know how it ends.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.673
He doesn't get the sale or a life.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.239
Peg.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.679
Bud.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.277
Over here, Dad.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.238
I'm sorry, son. Guess what happened
today at the shoe store.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.598
Did a fat woman come in?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.871
Enormous.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.309
Wow, that was a spine-tingler.

02:33.560 --> 02:37.917
Much better than yesterday's, "A fat
woman walked past the shoe store."

02:38.600 --> 02:40.875
Oh, I'm sorry, Peg.
I must have forgot my manners.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.315
How'd you do at work today?

02:46.440 --> 02:47.919
I see.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.795
This woman comes in,
and she is so fat...

02:51.000 --> 02:54.879
...she actually has three smaller women
orbiting around her.

02:59.160 --> 03:04.518
So I'm trying to force a pair
of size-13 shoes on her Jurassic feet...

03:05.640 --> 03:08.154
...when she says to me
that her husband just left her.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.236
The plot thins.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.517
Pardon me, son, let's hear
about your day at work today.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.874
That's interesting.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.674
So this woman's telling me
about how her husband left her.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.592
And she reaches into her purse...

03:22.840 --> 03:25.479
...moves aside the pastrami sub...

03:25.760 --> 03:29.469
...and produces
two $500 courtside tickets...

03:29.720 --> 03:32.632
...to tonight's
All-Star Charity Basketball Game.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.995
The one to send overprivileged
white kids to basketball camp?

03:40.200 --> 03:42.634
Hands Across the Suburbs?
She gave you these tickets?

03:42.880 --> 03:45.269
Sold them to me for $1 apiece,
which I didn't have...

03:45.520 --> 03:47.397
And, Peg, thank you for that.

03:47.840 --> 03:51.913
- but which I was able to borrow
at the mall fountain...

03:52.880 --> 03:54.836
...and the charity mint box.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.188
So Jerry Lewis can't afford Rip Taylor
this Labour Day.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.151
Now it's just a matter
of who I go with.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.839
- Well...
- No.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.799
And it's not because
I don't love you like a son, Buck.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.836
- Bud.
- Whatever.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.911
It's just that you can do
nothing for me.

04:16.120 --> 04:21.113
Now, see, these are power seats.
I need to talk somebody with influence.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.512
I wonder what the doorman
at the nudie bar's doing tonight.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.478
Well, it's fall.
Maybe he's taking his shower.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.715
Call him, Bud, he's on speed dial,
listed under Grandma.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.918
Peggy.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.314
Do I have the most romantic husband
or what?

04:48.560 --> 04:52.109
- Guess where he's taking me tonight.
- On the kitchen table?

04:54.160 --> 04:59.837
Better. He's taking me to see
The Captain and Tennille Unplugged.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.995
Gee, you would've thought somebody
would've plugged them by now.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.238
- It's their big reunion concert.
- Guess who's opening for them.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.272
The Carpenter?

05:16.320 --> 05:18.436
You saw it in the paper.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.918
Yeah, these reunion concerts
are great.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.236
They stir memories
of the good times you had...

05:23.440 --> 05:25.192
...with the woman
you've always loved...

05:25.400 --> 05:28.278
...and the great times you had
with the women you barely knew.

05:32.440 --> 05:36.194
I honestly can't think of another place
I'd rather be tonight.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.797
Please take me, Al.
Please. Please.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.635
- What are those tickets to?
- Basketball.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.279
What a snore.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.431
It may not have the same
excitement...

05:54.680 --> 05:58.355
...of "My Daddy Saw My Behind"
on Oprah Week...

05:59.480 --> 06:02.074
...but it gives me a reason to live.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.949
I want a reason too, Al.
What'll it take?

06:05.360 --> 06:08.272
- What have you got?
- Marcie's Discover Card.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.350
I'm over the limit on her Visa.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.954
You're gonna be over the limit
on your health insurance deductible...

06:16.200 --> 06:20.352
...if we're not arm-in-arm singing
"Muskrat Love" in a couple hours.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.795
- I can't go, Al.
- I didn't invite you.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.269
Al, how come we never go
to concerts?

06:29.520 --> 06:32.353
It's because we don't like
the same people.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.955
For instance, you like you.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.068
Peg, I can promise you...

06:39.280 --> 06:42.352
...the day they put Captain and Tennille
on a life-support system...

06:42.560 --> 06:45.438
...we'll be among the first
to see them unplugged.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.714
Well, if we didn't need them for sex,
they'd make great compost.

06:55.080 --> 06:58.595
Well, in that case,
you can grind mine up right now.

06:59.400 --> 07:03.234
Oh, Al, what is the big deal about
going to a basketball game anyway?

07:03.480 --> 07:05.391
I mean, you watch it on TV
all the time.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.154
Because there's nothing like
being there in person.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.550
This All-Star Game
is a once-a-year thing.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.439
I mean, it transcends basketball.
It's limos...

07:13.680 --> 07:15.716
- It's bright lights.
- Celebrities.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.394
Celebrities?
There's gonna be celebrities?

07:18.640 --> 07:21.950
No, Peg. I meant celeries.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.148
Celeries is the official vegetable
of the NBA.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.072
Al, I think I wanna go to this game.

07:30.320 --> 07:34.313
Peg, can't go.
Achmed the doorman is going.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.999
Dad, Achmed can't make it.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.800
It's Silicone Madness Night
at the nudie bar.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.472
- Tonight? Damn!
- Tonight? Damn!

07:49.600 --> 07:51.431
Well, then it's settled. I'm going.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.672
You can't, Peg. There's a league rule.
No women allowed.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.473
I'm gonna be late.
I'm going to the All-Star Game tonight.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.599
Wait a second.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.638
- How did you get a ticket?
- I don't need a ticket.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.158
I'm young, available
and I look like this.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.918
Kel, Kel.
When are you gonna give up?

08:22.160 --> 08:24.390
Every year you try to marry
a basketball player...

08:24.600 --> 08:26.636
...and every year you just get older.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.355
And another crop of girls turn 18.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.273
Soon you're gonna be
girding your loose loins in leather...

08:32.480 --> 08:36.029
...and sitting in the pathetically-past-
their-prime section with Dyan Cannon.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.075
Ho, ho, Pimple-stiltskin.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.951
By the way, the Eagle Scouts called,
your merit badge in celibacy came in.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.633
If I'm not back tonight,
then my mission was accomplished...

08:51.880 --> 08:56.112
...and you may forever refer to me
as Mrs. Vlade Divac.

09:00.840 --> 09:06.233
So, Al, what do you think
I should wear to the game tonight?

09:06.480 --> 09:10.234
Peg, you can wear your robe
and your bonbon bib for all I care...

09:10.480 --> 09:14.359
...because you're absolutely,
positively staying home!

09:24.200 --> 09:26.430
Now, isn't this fun?

09:36.520 --> 09:41.833
Look, Al. It's my very own
Patrick Ewing groin-pull doll.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.871
That's nice, Peg. At least
you won't be doing that to me now.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.275
This is the first time
you've been to a game...

09:52.520 --> 09:54.715
...so let me explain the rules
of basketball.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.838
Rule number one, no talking.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.511
And when you break rule number one,
and you will...

10:01.880 --> 10:03.871
...there's rule number two,
which is...

10:04.080 --> 10:07.834
...if I look at pretty girls walking
up and down the aisles, and I will...

10:08.800 --> 10:10.836
...you can't say,
"Are they prettier than me?"

10:11.080 --> 10:13.992
Always know the answer will be,
"Yes, she is."

10:14.240 --> 10:17.550
And in some cases, "Yes, he is."

10:20.840 --> 10:22.068
I'm sorry, honey.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.517
I was pulling on Patrick.
Did you say something?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.912
- Not a word.
- All, please rise.

10:29.160 --> 10:33.312
Tonight, singing our national anthem
is Ms. Tina Turner.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.837
Oh, say can you see

10:51.080 --> 10:53.435
There's more to see than this.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.594
By the dawn's early light

10:57.840 --> 11:00.513
But you'd be too tired to wake up.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.873
What so proudly we hail

11:05.120 --> 11:07.111
Who wrote this song?

11:07.720 --> 11:11.759
- AI, doesn't that look like it could be...?
- Shut up, Peg.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.435
At least it's better than Roseanne.

11:18.640 --> 11:23.509
And the home of the brave

11:23.760 --> 11:25.512
Call me, Vlade!

11:27.920 --> 11:30.753
And that concludes tonight's
national anthem.

11:32.560 --> 11:38.078
And now it's time to meet
your NB A All-Stars.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.788
And Danny Ainge.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.235
Al, I have to go to the bathroom.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.156
Come on, Al,
I want you to go with me.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.632
- Why?
- To keep the men from leering at me.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.429
Peg, they're not leering at you,
they're laughing at me.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.430
Honey, I really have to go.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.554
All right, but I don't wanna
miss the start of the game.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.877
I promise you won't.
Come on, hurry. We'll be quick.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.428
What a game.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.792
That was the most exciting quarter
and a half of basketball I've ever seen.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.070
Not as exciting
as me almost getting arrested...

12:39.280 --> 12:41.475
...for loitering
in front of the ladies' room.

12:42.120 --> 12:46.079
Well, you know I told you about putting
your hands down your pants in public.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.596
Well, it's the only fun I've had
in this game so far, Peg.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.156
What I'd like to do
is watch the rest of it...

12:52.360 --> 12:55.830
...in complete, total
and uninterrupted silence, okay?

12:56.040 --> 12:58.952
Okay, sweetie.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.116
Hey, Riley, nice hair.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.233
What, are you using 30-weight now?

13:09.880 --> 13:14.351
Hey, Barkley,
you're playing like a virgin.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.753
Al, you're being obnoxious.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.956
You're supposed to act
like that at a game.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.954
The players love it.
It shows you appreciate the sport.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.036
Hey, baldy.

13:30.280 --> 13:34.637
Are you a real player,
or did Sinead O'Connor get a tan?

13:41.960 --> 13:43.188
That's the wrong guy, Peg.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.994
That's Xavier McDaniel.
They call him the X-Man.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.959
Oh, he's coming this way, Peg.
You don't know me.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.997
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
but overhear your little witticism.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.031
He made me say it.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.758
My mistake.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.790
You know, Mr. X,
I might leave him alone.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.678
He played high school football.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.390
You'll hear it from me. You'll be leaving
the game on a stretcher.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.029
Hey, couldn't we start things off
as friends?

14:19.280 --> 14:21.953
Could you help me get
Shaquille O'Neal's autograph?

14:36.120 --> 14:39.795
You know, it is better
being here in person.

14:42.800 --> 14:47.476
That's the end of the first half,
with the score tied at 81-81.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.829
That's good.
I came to at just the right time.

14:53.280 --> 14:56.158
Hey, Al, could you change seats
with me? I can't see.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.675
You can't see what, Peg?
It's halftime.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.549
Yeah, but I think that's Joe Piscopo
over there.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.793
Over there, Peg? That's an usher.
Wait a second, that is Joe Piscopo.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.874
Honey, change seats with me. I won't
ask you for another thing. I promise.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.308
Come on.

15:12.520 --> 15:16.559
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to play Bask et-O-Cash.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.997
Some lucky fan will get a chance
to shoot from the free-throw line...

15:20.240 --> 15:23.232
...for $10, 000.

15:23.480 --> 15:27.234
And tonight's lucky contestant
is sitting in section eight...

15:27.480 --> 15:29.755
...row B, seat two.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.039
That's me! That's me!

15:35.000 --> 15:39.596
- It's me. It's you?
- Congratulations, miss. Right this way.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.360
But wait a second. No, see, see.
She's not me. I'm her.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.591
That was my seat. We switched.
Tell him, Peg.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.831
It's me. It's me!

15:47.080 --> 15:49.196
She doesn't have a chance
of making the shot.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.317
That's the way we like it.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.391
- Right this way.
- Oh, come on, let's go.

15:53.640 --> 15:59.715
And now, the precision choreography
of our own All-Star cheerleaders.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.716
Hi, Vlade. My name is Kelly.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.313
I can make you very happy.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.074
You can show me
how to set my VCR?

16:54.040 --> 16:55.268
If necessary.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.071
Here's my phone number.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.676
- There's only six numbers.
- Well, come on, I'm not easy.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.036
Call me, okay?
We can make it happen.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.589
Ms. Bundy, we'll be shooting in
about five minutes. Here are the rules.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.717
You get one shot
from the free-throw line.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.069
Make it, and you win $10,000.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.958
- Sounds easy.
- Any questions?

17:26.200 --> 17:29.431
Yeah, just one.
What's a free-throw line?

17:30.880 --> 17:32.598
Don't spend it all in one place.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.479
She'll be ready, wise guy.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.953
Shave your head, give me your hair,
I'm taking the shot.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.316
Don't be ridiculous, Al.

17:43.560 --> 17:47.394
I'm sure that if I practice, I can be just
as good as that Smoking Joe Louis...

17:47.640 --> 17:49.949
...or any of those
other quarterbacks.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.513
Another slow day, eh, God?

17:56.360 --> 17:57.588
Okay, now, look, Peg.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.913
- Now, pretend that I'm the basket.
- I don't know, honey.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.878
I've pretended you're a lot of things:

18:04.080 --> 18:09.393
A cowboy, a knight, Mr. T,
dead, but a basket...

18:09.640 --> 18:13.349
Peg, concentrate. This is $10,000.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.750
You know what I could do
with $10,000?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.798
Take 10,000 trips to the nudie bar?

18:19.440 --> 18:22.876
No, Peg. Just one great one.

18:24.040 --> 18:28.238
All right, now, relax, take aim,
bend your knees...

18:28.480 --> 18:32.553
...and let the ball roll slowly
off your fingertips.

18:44.920 --> 18:49.516
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear
the first time.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.553
Peg!

18:59.320 --> 19:04.519
NBA action, it's fantastic.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.037
And now it's time to play
Bask et-O-Cash.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.511
Tonight's lucky contestant
is a woman.

19:16.600 --> 19:21.037
From Chicago, Ms. Peg Bundy.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.830
Ms. Bundy says she's married
to a successful doctor...

19:29.080 --> 19:33.119
...and not to Al Bundy
the shoe salesman.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.828
And now, presenting
the Bask et-O-Cash ball...

19:37.080 --> 19:39.833
...a starting guard
for the Portland Trail Blazers...

19:40.080 --> 19:42.992
...and proud member
of America's Olympic Dream Team...

19:43.240 --> 19:46.073
...Clyde "The Glide" Drexler.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.551
You know, anyone can do that.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.950
I have to make it from here.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.948
Don't worry about it.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.754
Just think of the line
from that famous commercial.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.558
Oh, you mean, "Just do it"?

20:02.800 --> 20:06.110
Well, no.
I was thinking, "Leggo my Eggo."

20:06.360 --> 20:08.430
But yours is better.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.837
Okay. Good luck, Ms. Bundy.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.991
Don't be nerv ous.

20:16.720 --> 20:21.316
Ten thousand dollars
riding on this shot.

20:22.920 --> 20:27.277
Ten thousand people rooting for you.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.511
Or against you.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.638
Ten...

20:40.320 --> 20:43.312
Go ahead and shoot it, baby.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.553
The court's all yours, Peg.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.031
Ten thousand dollars.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.238
Gee, I wonder if I could get
a cheerleader for that.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.752
Ten thousand dollars.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.993
Gee, I wonder if I could get
a player for that.

21:13.840 --> 21:18.914
Hey, if we'd had her instead of Ainge,
we'd have won the championship.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.237
Now, now, Peg. Now, that's all right.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.516
You gave it your best shot.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.519
- You're not disappointed, Al?
- Disappointed, Peg?

21:35.760 --> 21:38.194
It's the only way it could be.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.078
I wanted it, I needed it, I deserved it.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.669
How else could it have turned out?

21:45.160 --> 21:48.914
- Then it's your fault.
- From the minute I said, I do.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.795
You know, honey,
I'm really sorry about the money.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.837
I guess basketball's
just not my game.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.310
I guess not, Peg.
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.039
Okay.
