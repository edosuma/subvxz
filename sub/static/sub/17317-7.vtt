00:13.010 --> 00:16.890
Tonight,
I look at the future of sports cars.

00:16.890 --> 00:21.610
James investigates the future of,
quite literally, everything.

00:21.610 --> 00:26.210
And Richard Hammond
smashes up another the caravan.

00:30.810 --> 00:33.530
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Hello.

00:33.530 --> 00:38.490
Hello, everybody. Hello and welcome.
Welcome. Thank you so much.

00:39.570 --> 00:43.690
Now, we begin tonight
with a tribute,

00:43.690 --> 00:48.730
a birthday tribute, in fact,
to Top Gear's favourite motor sport.

00:52.330 --> 00:55.730
It's not Formula One.
It's not rallying.

00:55.730 --> 01:00.970
It's something more humble,
and yet more exciting than both.

01:00.970 --> 01:06.010
Yes, we're here to light some
candles, 50 of them, in fact,
for British touring cars.

01:07.090 --> 01:13.690
And in that 50 years,
show me another sport where
there has been more close racing,

01:13.690 --> 01:15.890
more overtaking,

01:15.890 --> 01:19.170
and more amazing driving.

01:19.170 --> 01:22.570
Nothing comes close for excitement.
Oh, my goodness!

01:22.570 --> 01:28.690
Touring car racing was created
to help the motor industry shift
metal in the post-war years.

01:29.770 --> 01:34.170
Every car on the track looked
like the one your dad drove.

01:37.330 --> 01:43.170
And this, the mark I Jaguar,
was one of the first real stars.

01:45.650 --> 01:48.690
Tyres - they were skinny, very,

01:48.690 --> 01:53.170
and also crossply, which means
you went everywhere sideways.

01:54.810 --> 02:00.170
Roy James, the getaway driver
for the Great Train Robbers,
was a particular fan.

02:00.170 --> 02:03.010
When he was stealing
a Jaguar for a getaway car,

02:03.010 --> 02:07.850
he always made a point of taking one
that had been prepared
for touring car racing.

02:11.690 --> 02:18.690
But then, in the mid-60s, the Jags
had their noses put out of joint
because there was an invasion.

02:18.690 --> 02:22.890
The Mustang, the Falcon
and Chevy Chimera.

02:25.090 --> 02:31.410
Their massive V8s were
a most unwelcome intrusion
into this British sport.

02:35.650 --> 02:38.410
But the Yank invasion did bring about

02:38.410 --> 02:44.010
one of the best and most unique
aspect of British touring car racing.

02:44.010 --> 02:46.370
We call it
a David and Goliath effect.

02:50.010 --> 02:57.370
Basically, you had small engines,
nimble Escorts and Mini's
up against five-litre V8 monsters.

02:57.370 --> 03:00.010
With the big boys
fast on the straights,

03:00.010 --> 03:04.810
but the minnows quicker through the
corners, the racing was incredible.

03:04.810 --> 03:08.410
He's challenging for the lead and
Marsh is challenging for second.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.410
What a race this is!

03:15.410 --> 03:20.850
Naturally, the Mini's, being plucky
Brits, were involved in quite a lot
of this David and Goliath stuff.

03:20.850 --> 03:28.170
And in their over-eagerness,
demonstrated that other great
trait of touring cars - crashing.

03:33.970 --> 03:39.050
But BTCC isn't just about crashing.
It has many other fine qualities.

03:39.050 --> 03:46.130
It is the only sport where, over
the years, we've seen loads of F1
superstars up close in showroom cars.

03:46.130 --> 03:47.570
Graham Hill.

03:49.370 --> 03:50.730
Jim Clark.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.570
Nigel Mansell.

03:54.130 --> 03:58.610
All F1 world champions who were
fond of a good touring car race.

04:00.090 --> 04:04.130
Mind you, even though they were
racing at lower speeds than in F1,

04:04.130 --> 04:06.930
that didn't stop them crashing.

04:06.930 --> 04:10.130
Here, for example,
is Mansell crashing.

04:12.810 --> 04:16.010
And here is
Gabriele Tarquini crashing.

04:16.010 --> 04:18.690
Oh, it's Tarquini!

04:18.690 --> 04:21.250
But let's not get
hung up on crashing.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.210
As I say, touring cars is
about so much more than that.

04:25.970 --> 04:32.330
Everyone agrees Ford brought motor
sport to the working man, some say
they did it through rallying.

04:32.330 --> 04:34.410
But I disagree.

04:34.410 --> 04:39.530
I say they started this social
revolution through touring cars.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.970
Escorts, Cortinas and Capris.

04:41.970 --> 04:44.450
Over the decades, they had the lot.

04:46.690 --> 04:51.650
But their crowning glory
was this - the Sierra Cosworth.

04:53.210 --> 04:59.130
Two litres turbocharged up to
550 brake horse power.

04:59.130 --> 05:02.050
In the late '80s, it was invincible.

05:02.050 --> 05:04.690
It won 43 races.

05:05.770 --> 05:12.690
The Fords were hungry for wins and
inevitably, in their over-eagerness,
there were some crashes.

05:15.370 --> 05:19.650
But let's not lower the tone of
this film with gratuitous crashes.

05:19.650 --> 05:23.650
Touring cars is, as I say again,
about so much more than that.

05:25.530 --> 05:31.730
Especially during the 1990s,
a decade when all the engines were
capped at two litres

05:31.730 --> 05:35.010
and nearly every manufacturer
was taking part.

05:38.450 --> 05:43.890
Basically, every rep car in the high
street was out there swapping paint.

05:48.170 --> 05:53.250
In the last race of 1992,
for instance, in the final two laps,

05:53.250 --> 05:56.250
any one of three drivers
could have won the championship.

05:57.410 --> 06:00.730
And just look at the
kind of racing that produced.

06:00.730 --> 06:04.650
One of the contenders, Steve Soper,
having been punted off

06:04.650 --> 06:08.930
and now fighting his way from
the back, drove out of his skin.

06:08.930 --> 06:12.090
Soper goes through to fourth
position inside the Vauxhall.

06:14.170 --> 06:18.490
Tim Harvey in the second BMW
is on the inside.

06:18.490 --> 06:24.810
He's gone through. But John Cleland
is attacking Soper. He's up on
two wheels. Soper holds his line.

06:24.810 --> 06:28.730
He attacks again as they...
He goes into a spin!

06:28.730 --> 06:33.970
That one race alone sums up
everything that's so brilliant
about touring cars.

06:36.530 --> 06:40.330
And even though the '90s was
the high budget corporate era,

06:40.330 --> 06:43.970
naturally, there were
a few spills along the way.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.810
Here.

06:45.810 --> 06:47.730
And here.

06:47.730 --> 06:50.010
And here.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.890
And here.

06:52.890 --> 06:56.010
So, happy birthday, touring cars.

06:56.010 --> 07:01.450
And I still can't quite put my
finger on why we like it so much.

07:13.690 --> 07:16.330
I love it. I love it.

07:16.330 --> 07:18.930
The only problem is...

07:18.930 --> 07:25.730
for the last, what, two or three
years, it hasn't really been
as good as it used to be.

07:25.730 --> 07:30.210
It'll be worse next year
because Seat has pulled out so
it's just going to be Vauxhalls.

07:30.210 --> 07:34.490
I've just thought of a way
it could be rescued. Oh, God.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.970
No! No, honestly, you'll like this.

07:36.970 --> 07:41.290
I'm sure I will, but I bet it's not
realistic. Let me run that past you.

07:41.290 --> 07:47.890
You line all the cars up on
the grid, and then just before the
flag drops, set them all on fire.

07:47.890 --> 07:50.170
Yeah, like I said...

07:50.170 --> 07:54.050
Think, think, think!
You can either drive slowly,

07:54.050 --> 07:57.170
hoping that the car isn't completely
engulfed before the race is over,

07:57.170 --> 08:01.890
or very fast to try and put
the flames out. Imagine,
who here would like to see that?

08:01.890 --> 08:03.570
CHEERING

08:03.570 --> 08:06.730
That's 100% of British people

08:06.730 --> 08:13.490
want the BTCC to become the
Burning Touring Car Championship.
Yep. Shall we do the news now?

08:13.490 --> 08:15.170
Right, the news.

08:15.170 --> 08:22.530
A lot of people are angry that
Jeremy and I may have set fire to
a Morris Marina we bought last week.

08:22.530 --> 08:26.850
Yeah, we've got a shot of it here,
look, actually on fire.

08:26.850 --> 08:31.610
This has enraged the Morris Marina
Owners' Club. The what?

08:31.610 --> 08:38.929
The Morris Marina Owners' Club.
Have you heard of an organisation
you want to be a member of less?

08:38.929 --> 08:45.370
What I've got here are some of the
things they've been saying on the
Morris Marina Owners' Club website.

08:45.370 --> 08:47.690
"Top Gear can eat BLEEP and die."

08:48.850 --> 08:54.650
Bit strong. "Clarkson and his cronies
should be hung, drawn and quartered,
or is that too good for them?"

08:54.650 --> 08:57.650
It should be T-O-O. Small point.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.490
LAUGHTER

08:59.490 --> 09:01.770
This just goes on and on.
This is one of my favourites -

09:01.770 --> 09:06.970
"I will send the BBC an e-mail and
I don't care if they don't read it."

09:06.970 --> 09:09.450
Well, they did! Ha!

09:09.450 --> 09:12.490
These really are very, very angry,
aren't they?

09:12.490 --> 09:19.170
Joking aside, we don't like to
upset any member of our audience,
no matter how mad they might be.

09:19.170 --> 09:23.690
So we undertake never to
destroy another Morris Marina
as long as we're on the air.

09:23.690 --> 09:29.490
In fact, we've gone one better
because we've been out
and bought another Marina, OK,

09:29.490 --> 09:34.730
and it's a beauty. It really is.
Absolutely. Low mileage,
leather seats...

09:34.730 --> 09:36.810
No, there's no, "Ooh!" about it!

09:36.810 --> 09:40.730
We've brought it down.
This is live feed out to our track.

09:40.730 --> 09:44.770
That's going to be preserved
as an example of what? Oh, God!

09:45.850 --> 09:47.250
God!

09:51.650 --> 09:54.890
Somebody's dropped
an old piano on it.

09:54.890 --> 09:57.530
How unlucky was that?!

09:57.530 --> 10:00.130
This is happening all the time.

10:00.130 --> 10:03.810
It's always happening at our track.
It rains pianos here.

10:03.810 --> 10:09.730
It's that new helicopter piano
removal company that moved in
next door. Careless Airways.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.730
They're rubbish.
Yeah, slapdash services.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.970
They've just dropped another...
God, now what?

10:14.970 --> 10:17.250
We'll have to get another one.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.770
Let's be honest, actually.
I'm sorry to bang on about this,

10:20.770 --> 10:25.650
but the Gaydon Motor Museum,
I'm sure they'll have
a Morris Marina preserved.

10:25.650 --> 10:27.410
You don't need to preserve two.

10:27.410 --> 10:29.970
It's not like you need to
preserve a breeding pair.

10:29.970 --> 10:33.770
You need one
as a warning from history.

10:34.930 --> 10:39.290
Right... Now, in a tradition
stretching back two years,

10:39.290 --> 10:45.050
it's time for the annual Top Gear
look at Christmas presents
with a motoring theme bit.

10:45.050 --> 10:47.290
Yes, I've got a bag here
full of gift ideas.

10:47.290 --> 10:51.490
Literally, more gift ideas in here
than you can shake a stick at.

10:51.490 --> 10:56.290
Go on, what have you got?
Starting with this, it's an
eco calculator from Renault.

10:56.290 --> 10:59.370
Now, you charge it up by doing this.

11:01.450 --> 11:04.970
I don't know what was wrong
with solar power, personally.

11:04.970 --> 11:08.490
I just think some people find this
comes more naturally to them.

11:08.490 --> 11:14.930
Renault think it comes
naturally to their customers.
So there you are. That's that.

11:16.090 --> 11:23.570
Now, smokers, are you worried
about the excess space around your
existing pink metallic ashtray?

11:23.570 --> 11:26.130
Are you a motoring enthusiast?

11:26.130 --> 11:29.290
If so, worry no more because
you can now fill that space

11:29.290 --> 11:35.250
with this plastic disc brake
and caliper-themed
ashtray surround novelty.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.450
What is that?! Look at that.

11:37.450 --> 11:42.010
What's that? Who thought pink and red
would be a good idea going together?

11:42.010 --> 11:45.290
You think that's his biggest
problem?! You're worried
about the colour scheme?!

11:45.290 --> 11:49.570
Look at these little
remote-controlled cars we've
been sent. You turn them on.

11:49.570 --> 11:54.410
They make a bit of a din because,
for reasons we can't work out,

11:54.410 --> 11:58.410
they stick to vertical surfaces,
and then you can drive them about.

11:58.410 --> 12:01.970
Now, this is great, OK,
this is fantastic.

12:01.970 --> 12:05.610
Except, of course, we decided
to see how big the range was.

12:05.610 --> 12:09.090
Earlier in the week,
we decided to try them out

12:09.090 --> 12:14.410
by seeing how high up the side
of the BBC we could get them to go.

12:14.410 --> 12:21.050
So, if you were watching
The One Show last night,

12:21.050 --> 12:27.610
Supermarkets, along with every
store, try hard to stop us counting
the pennies in favour of...

12:27.610 --> 12:30.010
LAUGHTER DROWNS SPEECH

12:34.810 --> 12:36.250
Sorry.

12:38.490 --> 12:43.770
We'd like to say sorry
to The One Show for ruining
your show like that.

12:43.770 --> 12:48.010
Now, is it me? Yes!
We're so rubbish at Christmas.

12:49.290 --> 12:52.770
Would anybody here like to
hazard a guess at what this is?

12:52.770 --> 12:54.810
AUDIENCE RESPOND OUT OF EARSHOT
It's what?

12:54.810 --> 12:57.410
How can you know that?!

12:57.410 --> 13:01.570
Have you got one? Our friends
bought us one as a present.

13:01.570 --> 13:06.090
This lady knows the answer.
This is a she wee.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.450
They're with you!

13:10.450 --> 13:16.410
The idea is if you're
on a long motorway journey,
desperate for a wee,

13:16.410 --> 13:21.250
you undo your trousers...
Ladies, this is. This is ladies.

13:21.250 --> 13:27.250
It comes with a little bag...
I'm disturbed by what I'm seeing!
..and you fill it up.

13:27.250 --> 13:33.850
The only thing is, OK,
the literature here,
it says it can also be used

13:33.850 --> 13:36.410
on airplanes...

13:36.410 --> 13:41.690
on ski lifts and, look at
this one, "while queuing".

13:41.690 --> 13:45.650
Queuing? What, in the post office?
Yes.

13:45.650 --> 13:53.050
Do any girls want to see if they
can have a wee in this bag without
the person next to them noticing?

13:54.650 --> 14:00.850
What I like is, if you read through
the marketing on the box, there's
a lot of, "Yeah, go, girls!

14:00.850 --> 14:06.490
"Men have had this for ages,"
then it goes on about using this
thing to wee in post office queues

14:06.490 --> 14:12.610
as if they imagine that those of us
who've had one for years, a natural
he wee that we're born with,

14:12.610 --> 14:18.410
I've had that for 38 years
and I've never got it out in
a post office queue to have a wee.

14:18.410 --> 14:24.810
Right, I'd like to demonstrate this.
It's what I like to think of
as the perfect social leper kit,

14:24.810 --> 14:30.770
partly because it's a belt-mounted
leatherette smoker's pouch so you can
put your cigarette and lighter in.

14:30.770 --> 14:34.570
It's a double whammy because it comes
in with a really big right hook.

14:34.570 --> 14:36.690
Look at the badge... Oh, my God!

14:36.690 --> 14:42.450
An MG smoker's pouch, which means
you'll walk into your favourite pub
and they'll say, "You, outside."

14:42.450 --> 14:48.090
"I wasn't going to light up."
"No, but you might talk about MGs.
Get out!" It's shameful.

14:48.090 --> 14:51.410
I have to say, as well,
MG branding is out of hand -

14:51.410 --> 14:55.050
MG socks, MG underpants,
MG overnight bag,

14:55.050 --> 15:01.370
which is full of all the MG things
we could lay our hands on yesterday.
We're going to play a game now.

15:01.370 --> 15:07.370
We're going to see how much of it
we can get on to Richard Hammond
in 30 seconds.

15:07.370 --> 15:10.450
Who would like to see that? Anybody?
YEAH!

15:10.450 --> 15:13.770
Start the clock. May, you're
going to have to give us a hand.

15:13.770 --> 15:17.130
Ready, steady, go! Let's dress
Richard Hammond. Where's the belt?

15:17.130 --> 15:22.850
Where's the bloody belt gone?
Shoes... Hammond. Slippers.

15:22.850 --> 15:25.890
Hat, hat, hat. Belt, belt, belt.

15:27.690 --> 15:30.450
Come on! Get the apron!

15:30.450 --> 15:33.970
Shoe off. Give me
the apron, apron, apron...

15:33.970 --> 15:36.170
GASPS

15:37.290 --> 15:39.290
It's all broken!

15:42.250 --> 15:44.290
It's OK, it's OK.

15:44.290 --> 15:46.010
Keep going!

15:47.730 --> 15:51.450
Look what you're done to our tree?
Look, it's our tree!

15:51.450 --> 15:54.570
That might have happened.
Look! He's done it.

15:54.570 --> 15:57.050
I've hit you in the face.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.370
Here, James, you can keep the fairy.

15:59.370 --> 16:01.570
LAUGHTER

16:01.570 --> 16:04.610
Christmas is saved.
It is. We've saved that.

16:04.610 --> 16:07.090
Right, back to it.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.610
Actually, can I just make a point?

16:09.610 --> 16:12.170
JEREMY LAUGHS

16:12.170 --> 16:14.970
It's a serious one, actually.

16:14.970 --> 16:20.490
Grandparents, if you have
grandkids who like cars,
what they like is cars, OK?

16:20.490 --> 16:24.810
They don't like towels
with car names written on them.

16:24.810 --> 16:27.570
Apart from anything else, named
stuff is often a waste of money.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.610
You can buy a bottle of red wine
for £2.99, £3.99 in the shops.

16:31.610 --> 16:38.930
If you get a bottle of red wine
with the Alpha Romeo logo on it,
it's 15 quid. I can beat that, mate.

16:38.930 --> 16:42.330
This is an ice scraper, OK?
It's covered in Santa's pubes.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.850
LAUGHTER

16:44.850 --> 16:50.730
It's got Saab written on it.
£38.50. What, for that?!
It's given us an idea, this.

16:50.730 --> 16:53.450
See this, this is a plate of sick.

16:53.450 --> 16:55.330
GROANS

16:55.330 --> 16:59.730
It is utterly worthless,
but if I pop a BMW badge on it,

16:59.730 --> 17:02.370
£13.80.

17:02.370 --> 17:07.609
It does work, this sort of branding.
This wizard's sleeve, for instance.

17:07.609 --> 17:12.369
Absolutely worthless,
but if it bears a Ferrari badge, £45.

17:12.369 --> 17:14.569
GROANS
This pork sword...

17:14.569 --> 17:19.849
James, don't do the pork sword!
This cock...
Has it got four rings on it?

17:19.849 --> 17:25.050
Yes, it has. Put this cock
in your wizard's sleeve...

17:25.050 --> 17:28.210
It's all gone horribly wrong.

17:28.210 --> 17:31.170
OK, that is the end of the news,

17:31.170 --> 17:34.970
so let's move it on now
have to brown rice eco cars.

17:34.970 --> 17:39.010
The trouble is that they're
a bit like cod liver oil.

17:39.010 --> 17:43.530
Very good for you, but you'd rather
have a plate of steak and chips.

17:43.530 --> 17:47.370
Take the Toyota Prius here
and the G-Wiz - very earnest.

17:47.370 --> 17:53.610
But there's nothing here to make
an ordinary human being go,
"Pwah, yeah, I want one of those."

17:53.610 --> 17:58.130
Now, however, there is an
eco electric car which does.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.450
It's called the Tesla.

18:03.450 --> 18:08.610
It's made in California,
it's based on the Lotus Elise...

18:11.050 --> 18:14.050
..and, as a result, it looks good.

18:15.170 --> 18:22.650
However, you are going to look like
a bit of a berk driving around in
the low-slung convertible sports car

18:22.650 --> 18:26.450
if you get burned off
at the lights by a fat jogger.

18:27.930 --> 18:30.930
The thing is, though,
Tesla say it's pretty nippy

18:30.930 --> 18:35.730
so what I've done is lined it up
alongside a normal
petrol-powered Elise

18:35.730 --> 18:39.930
and now we shall see
which is the fastest in a drag race.

18:41.450 --> 18:45.250
BLEEPING
Right, it's on...I think.

18:45.250 --> 18:49.650
There's no noise at all,
but put it into drive.
There's a one speed gearbox.

18:49.650 --> 18:53.530
They tried it with a two-speed -
that kept breaking, so one it is.

18:53.530 --> 18:56.450
We're in drive and I'm ready.

19:05.130 --> 19:07.450
God almighty!

19:07.450 --> 19:10.810
Wave goodbye to dial up

19:10.810 --> 19:15.130
and say hello to the world
of broadband motoring.

19:16.210 --> 19:19.930
12,500rpm, I cannot believe this!

19:20.970 --> 19:23.290
That's biblically quick!

19:23.290 --> 19:26.170
This car is electric!

19:26.170 --> 19:27.770
Literally.

19:34.610 --> 19:37.970
The top speed may only be 125...

19:39.570 --> 19:45.370
..but there's so much torque
it does 0-60 in 3.9 seconds.

19:47.770 --> 19:54.930
Not bad from a motor
that's the size of a watermelon
and only has one moving part.

19:58.810 --> 20:03.130
And even more not bad when you
start looking into the costs.

20:03.130 --> 20:07.370
Filling a normal Elise
with petrol costs £40.

20:07.370 --> 20:13.530
Filling this with cheap-rate
electricity costs just £3.50.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.970
It's not what you'd call quiet -

20:17.970 --> 20:22.810
a fair bit of wind noise
from around the roof
and there's a lot of tyre roar.

20:24.130 --> 20:28.730
But that's a small price to pay
when you consider the upsides.

20:31.530 --> 20:35.450
And I haven't even got
to the really big upside yet.

20:37.490 --> 20:40.730
An electric G-Wiz, with
its old-fashioned batteries,

20:40.730 --> 20:45.890
has a top speed of a horse and is
out of juice after 40 miles or so.

20:45.890 --> 20:49.930
This runs on the same sort of
batteries that you get in a laptop,

20:49.930 --> 20:54.370
but it has 6,831 of them.

20:54.370 --> 20:58.290
So Tesla say,
even if you drive quickly,

20:58.290 --> 21:02.690
it'll go 200 miles
between trips to the plug.

21:05.010 --> 21:07.410
SCREECHING

21:08.530 --> 21:14.490
Of course, putting 6,000
laptop batteries in a car
does add a fair bit of weight.

21:16.890 --> 21:22.130
Half a tonne, to be exact, and that
does affect the handling slightly.

21:22.130 --> 21:28.930
The chassis is aluminium and the
body is carbon fibre, which,
of course, is very light,

21:28.930 --> 21:33.970
but with that big lump
of batteries in the middle,
it's kind of like me -

21:33.970 --> 21:39.810
thin at one end, thinning
at the other, and a big fat bit
in the middle.

21:42.370 --> 21:46.730
Couple that to wheels
which are set up for rolling
resistance rather than handling,

21:46.730 --> 21:49.090
and the result is this.

21:50.970 --> 21:54.290
The Elise will squeak
past in a hammerhead.

21:59.810 --> 22:01.410
Yes, come on!

22:01.410 --> 22:03.450
Come on!

22:03.450 --> 22:06.170
Hello! Bye!

22:07.250 --> 22:11.650
The volthead
has overtaken the petrolhead.

22:11.650 --> 22:15.570
And yes, yes, I've just heard,
it IS snowing in hell.

22:20.290 --> 22:25.250
This car really was shaping up
to be something wonderful,

22:25.250 --> 22:26.610
but then...

22:26.610 --> 22:30.130
ENGINE CUTS OUT
Oh.

22:30.130 --> 22:36.810
Although Tesla say it will do 200
miles, we worked out that, on our
track, it'd run out after 55 miles

22:36.810 --> 22:41.730
and if it does run out, it's not
a quick job to charge it up again.

22:41.730 --> 22:44.970
To fill the tank on a normal car
takes what? A couple of minutes?

22:44.970 --> 22:48.250
To fully recharge
the batteries in this

22:48.250 --> 22:53.330
from a normal 13 amp socket
like that takes 16 hours.

22:53.330 --> 22:59.250
So, to get from here
to the top of Scotland
would take more than three days.

22:59.250 --> 23:03.290
And before green people say
it's a price worth paying,

23:03.290 --> 23:07.810
let's not forget where
the electricity in this socket
is coming from.

23:18.770 --> 23:22.050
Of course, you could get yourself
a little windmill, like that,

23:22.050 --> 23:26.330
which generates electricity at no
cost to you or a jolly polar bear.

23:26.330 --> 23:32.250
But to charge a Tesla from something
like that would take 600 hours.

23:32.250 --> 23:37.130
That's 25 days. And that's
assuming it's windy,

23:37.130 --> 23:39.330
which it isn't.

23:42.490 --> 23:49.650
Perhaps, then, the best idea is
to have two Teslas, so you can use
one while the other is charging.

23:51.090 --> 23:55.330
Unfortunately, that's
quite an expensive solution

23:55.330 --> 23:59.130
because Teslas cost £92,000 each.

24:00.650 --> 24:02.090
92,000!

24:06.650 --> 24:11.050
They're three times more
expensive than Elises.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.330
It's madness!

24:13.890 --> 24:18.130
And it doesn't appear you get much
in the way of reliability either.

24:18.130 --> 24:24.610
Oh, I don't believe this.
The motor's overheating
and I've got reduced power.

24:24.610 --> 24:30.050
While it cooled down, we went
to get the silver car out again -

24:30.050 --> 24:35.370
only to find that while it was being
charged, its brakes had broken.

24:35.370 --> 24:39.170
So then, with the light fading,
we had no cars at all.

24:40.850 --> 24:43.650
I did think that the
Teslas would bring

24:43.650 --> 24:47.970
a bit of peace and quiet to our
track with their electric motors.

24:47.970 --> 24:51.050
I didn't think it would be
this much peace and quiet, though.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.530
That is the sound of silence.

25:00.450 --> 25:04.610
What we have here then is an
astonishing technical achievement.

25:06.170 --> 25:10.290
The first electric car that
you might actually want to buy.

25:10.290 --> 25:15.490
It's just a shame that in the real
world, it doesn't seem to work.

25:28.010 --> 25:31.930
I tried, to be fair.
I did try, but it didn't work.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.250
It's not good, though, is it?

25:34.250 --> 25:37.050
I think the price will go down.
Once... What's he called?

25:37.050 --> 25:43.050
Brad Cruise and Leonardo Di
Clooney - once they've bought
600 each, then the price will drop.

25:43.050 --> 25:47.050
Once they've made a few, they'll
get better at the reliability.

25:47.050 --> 25:51.850
That's as maybe, but, as I aim
to demonstrate later in the show,

25:51.850 --> 25:55.050
battery-powered electric
cars will soon die altogether.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.090
We're looking forward to that.
I am anyway.

25:57.090 --> 26:01.490
Now, we have to find how fast
the Tesla goes round our track.

26:01.490 --> 26:05.130
That of course means handing
it over to our racing driver.

26:05.130 --> 26:09.650
Some say that he doesn't
like to get his helmet wet.

26:11.690 --> 26:17.610
A point that was proved last week,
when he was caught in the back
of shot by an eagle-eyed viewer.

26:20.810 --> 26:23.330
All we know is,
he's called The Stig.

26:23.330 --> 26:28.610
There he goes, to the sound
of...some sporty silence.

26:28.610 --> 26:32.850
Its quite eerie. He's powering
hard down to the first corner.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.610
Eco-tyres squealing,

26:35.610 --> 26:38.450
steady on umbrella boy!

26:38.450 --> 26:42.370
MORSE CODE PLAYS

26:45.090 --> 26:48.210
More Morse nonsense there
to excite the internet.

26:48.210 --> 26:52.810
He's looking very good
through Chicago
and it's the hammerhead next.

26:52.810 --> 26:58.450
Hard on the brakes. The Tesla has
a system that uses energy from the
brakes to top up the batteries.

26:58.450 --> 27:04.410
Feels a bit weird because it gives
you more braking than would expect,
but that hasn't fazed The Stig.

27:04.410 --> 27:06.610
MORSE CODE PLAYS

27:13.530 --> 27:20.610
Time to turn up the dimmer switch,
through the follow-through, does
he lift? Hard to tell, actually.

27:20.610 --> 27:25.410
But that's fast. Shame it doesn't
come with a CD of V8 noises, really.

27:25.410 --> 27:29.170
Two corners left,
he really slings it in there.

27:29.170 --> 27:32.690
Here we are... Oh, look,
maybe a few released G's.

27:32.690 --> 27:35.090
And across the line!

27:36.370 --> 27:37.570
OK...

27:38.610 --> 27:40.650
It did it...

27:40.650 --> 27:47.010
It did it in 1.27.2,
on a mildly moist circuit
so look at that.

27:47.010 --> 27:52.890
Exactly the same conditions, exactly
the same time as a Porsche 911 GT3.

27:52.890 --> 27:58.690
That's incredible.
But also, as James will explain
later, completely irrelevant.

27:58.690 --> 28:03.010
We all know the problems
faced every day by the elderly.

28:03.010 --> 28:07.810
At home watching TV,
something comes on, they want
to change channel, "Can't reach!"

28:07.810 --> 28:13.690
momentum in the rocking chair until
they can reach forwards and get it.

28:13.690 --> 28:17.290
Ah! And that's hard
if you've got arthritis.

28:17.290 --> 28:24.050
However, you can now wave goodbye
to the misery of being forced
to watch Adrian Chiles

28:24.050 --> 28:29.490
because I've connected this chair
to a 6.2 litre V8 engine.

28:29.490 --> 28:34.410
It's the same Corvette
engine we used a couple of weeks
ago to power the food blender.

28:34.410 --> 28:37.810
Did you say you were going
to use it to power a stair lift?

28:37.810 --> 28:40.090
Yes, I did.
Sadly the test went wrong.

28:40.090 --> 28:44.570
I used an old lady and her spine
came out of the top of her head.
It was...

28:44.570 --> 28:50.330
Let's not dwell on who killed who,
because it's time now
to test this one.

28:50.330 --> 28:53.010
Yes, I think we'll use a dummy
this time. Good idea with the dummy.

28:53.010 --> 28:58.530
I should explain,
normally the accelerator
would be on the chair itself,

28:58.530 --> 29:01.170
so the elderly person
could simply push it there.

29:01.170 --> 29:04.810
But, because we're using a dummy,
I have the accelerator here.

29:04.810 --> 29:08.850
The idea, we start up the engine,
the chair begins to rock

29:08.850 --> 29:14.170
and the old lady can effortlessly
make Adrian Chiles go away.

29:14.170 --> 29:18.210
Are we ready to try out?
YEAH! Here we go.

29:18.210 --> 29:20.450
ENGINE STARTS

29:20.450 --> 29:22.850
ENGINE REVS VIOLENTLY

29:22.850 --> 29:25.570
LAUGHTER

29:32.970 --> 29:37.850
I think that didn't work
very well because... No, listen!

29:37.850 --> 29:41.250
It hasn't worked.
There are a few issues.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.650
The noise is so great you'd
never hear the TV, would you?

29:44.650 --> 29:48.810
There's that and the fact that
the old lady has disintegrated!

29:48.810 --> 29:50.570
Her head has come off.

29:50.570 --> 29:52.210
I tell you what we'll do now,

29:52.210 --> 29:55.890
we'll put a star
in a reasonably-priced car.

29:55.890 --> 29:58.650
My guest tonight has said
that he doesn't like it

29:58.650 --> 30:01.690
when women throw knickers at him
when he's on the stage,

30:01.690 --> 30:04.410
booming out in his big Welsh way
to the audience.

30:04.410 --> 30:06.370
He's never said anything about men.

30:06.370 --> 30:10.130
So gentlemen, if you want
to remove your Y-fronts,
get ready to lob them.

30:10.130 --> 30:11.530
Sir Tom Jones!

30:11.530 --> 30:13.410
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:16.410 --> 30:18.130
I can hardly believe it!

30:19.970 --> 30:25.810
A legend! A legend has come
among us. Have a seat.

30:29.210 --> 30:34.530
I never thought the day would come
when I'd be interviewing
Sir Tom Jones. Ah, well! But we are.

30:34.530 --> 30:36.930
Can I begin with your voice?

30:36.930 --> 30:40.650
Yes. Is it true you used to be able
to break microphones with it?

30:40.650 --> 30:42.610
I still do. You still do?

30:42.610 --> 30:45.930
Sometimes. It depends
if I record with somebody

30:45.930 --> 30:48.650
that I haven't recorded with before

30:48.650 --> 30:51.770
and they don't know
how much volume I use.

30:51.770 --> 30:55.810
I remember that Perfect Day song,
you remember, a while back?

30:55.810 --> 30:59.930
The BBC got everybody to sing.
You came right at the end.

30:59.930 --> 31:03.170
It came on the radio, if you
really liked it, you'd turn it up.

31:03.170 --> 31:09.810
Then you always forgot Tom
was about to come on, then he'd blow
the bloody doors off the car!

31:09.810 --> 31:13.970
Blood pouring out of my ears,
so on. Does age diminish it?

31:13.970 --> 31:17.450
Not at all, not with me, anyway.
Thank God. Do you maintain it?

31:17.450 --> 31:20.170
Do you eat lozenges?

31:20.170 --> 31:23.290
Yeah, Vocalzones.
What are they called?

31:23.290 --> 31:26.610
It's a Vocalzone.
Is that one of those black things?

31:26.610 --> 31:29.250
Tastes disgusting!
No, they're great.

31:29.250 --> 31:33.010
Made in England. Made in England?
Didn't think you'd like that!

31:33.010 --> 31:37.570
Well, I think they were
originally made in Wales
and then the English stole it.

31:37.570 --> 31:40.970
Why do you think the Welsh
are such good singers?

31:40.970 --> 31:43.490
Maybe it's something to do
with the Welsh air?

31:43.490 --> 31:47.970
The Welsh water? But you're in Los
Angeles now! Unless you import it.

31:50.370 --> 31:54.970
Big pipe over the Atlantic!
Piping it in from the valleys.
From the valleys.

31:54.970 --> 31:59.570
I was looking into Welsh things
the other day.
There's a type, isn't there?

31:59.570 --> 32:02.810
Aled Jones, Harry Secombe,
Max Boyce. Then you've got Duffy.

32:02.810 --> 32:05.450
Duffy, quite right.
Who isn't your daughter.

32:05.450 --> 32:07.130
Not as far as I know.

32:07.130 --> 32:09.050
LAUGHTER

32:09.810 --> 32:13.930
You've got a new album out,
which is why you're here,
to tell us all about it.

32:13.930 --> 32:16.690
So what is it, what have you got
in store for us?

32:16.690 --> 32:20.770
I co-wrote most of the songs.
You wrote them?

32:20.770 --> 32:24.410
I co-wrote, with other writers,
but there's a lot of me in there.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.650
Like, when I asked Bono
to write me a song

32:27.650 --> 32:31.250
and he said he'd write one for me,
but he'd like it to be about me.

32:31.250 --> 32:36.570
So, he asked me some questions,
I gave him some information
and he wrote Sugar Daddy.

32:36.570 --> 32:39.170
That's the name of the song.

32:39.170 --> 32:43.010
What questions did he ask you
of Sugar Daddy?

32:43.010 --> 32:45.730
He asked me what I did before
I got into showbusiness.

32:45.730 --> 32:50.650
He remembered when he was a kid
and saw me on television and
he liked the shirts and the shoes.

32:50.650 --> 32:54.130
Those things are in there.
The lines are in the song.

32:54.130 --> 32:56.930
That's what led to this album.

32:56.930 --> 33:01.730
We've got a clip which we'd like
to show for you. We'll pop this on.

33:01.730 --> 33:05.930
# It would be a crime
to ever let you go

33:05.930 --> 33:10.090
# It should be a crime
to keep you very close

33:10.090 --> 33:14.130
# No-one else can pass,
you're a cut above the rest

33:14.130 --> 33:19.410
# He'd be such a fool
if he should ever leave you... #

33:20.810 --> 33:22.850
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

33:22.850 --> 33:24.530
You are looking good.

33:24.530 --> 33:31.250
How do you look that good?
Have you had...? No. Nothing?

33:31.250 --> 33:33.730
I had my nose fixed.
What was the matter with it?

33:33.730 --> 33:36.010
It was broken. Oh, was it? Yes.

33:37.850 --> 33:41.290
Yeah, a lot of that.
It was a Welsh kiss!

33:41.290 --> 33:44.530
When you were a kid?
Yeah, when I was a teenager.

33:44.530 --> 33:47.090
What about the barnet, the hair?
Yes.

33:47.090 --> 33:50.890
If you were going to grow it long,
would it be as dreadful as mine is?

33:50.890 --> 33:55.170
I'd think so. Have you got
the same... Curly hair. Pubes.

33:55.170 --> 33:57.370
Pubic hair.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.170
Might have gone off-topic here.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.410
LAUGHTER

34:01.410 --> 34:03.610
Chest hair, your chest hair.

34:03.610 --> 34:07.130
Is it true that you once insured it
for $7 million?

34:07.130 --> 34:10.170
No, it's not true. I don't know
why the rumour started,

34:10.170 --> 34:13.290
but people were asking me about it,
they thought it was true.

34:13.290 --> 34:16.330
One thing that isn't a rumour -
the knickers thing.

34:16.330 --> 34:19.570
The girls throwing knickers at you.

34:19.570 --> 34:22.370
You've been married
to the same girl for 50 years,

34:22.370 --> 34:25.730
did she get fed up with you
coming home draped in underwear?

34:25.730 --> 34:28.810
No, I never took any home.

34:28.810 --> 34:31.290
I think the band used
to eat it, or something.

34:33.969 --> 34:37.650
I did ask, if any men want
to throw any pants...

34:38.969 --> 34:40.610
Uh-oh!

34:41.969 --> 34:46.690
You're well to look frightened!
I bet! Anything could happen.

34:46.690 --> 34:50.010
Cars, OK? How long have you
been driving for?

34:50.010 --> 34:54.130
In Wales, there wouldn't have been
any cars when you were growing up!

34:54.130 --> 34:58.090
I don't mean to be rude,
obviously, I just mean it to be
a social commentary.

34:58.090 --> 35:02.370
Horse and carts. It would have been,
actually. There were some around.

35:02.370 --> 35:05.810
What was the first car?
A Jaguar, a 3.8 Jag.

35:05.810 --> 35:07.370
And what became of that?

35:07.370 --> 35:09.690
I crashed it on Park Lane.

35:09.690 --> 35:15.170
But I was banned. I was banned,
in Wales, from driving,

35:15.170 --> 35:19.250
because I was driving without
a licence and insurance and stuff.

35:19.250 --> 35:24.410
I think you'll find the law in Wales
is pretty similar to the law...

35:24.410 --> 35:29.690
I had to wait until I got a driver's
licence, and funnily enough,

35:29.690 --> 35:36.290
that's the last time I drove a manual
shift car. What do you drive now?

35:36.290 --> 35:41.050
I have a Mercedes 55 SL.

35:41.050 --> 35:44.770
I used to have one of those!
It actually sounds like you!

35:44.770 --> 35:48.090
It's funny, I heard you'd said that.

35:48.090 --> 35:49.770
It does! Grr!

35:51.930 --> 35:56.170
Grr! You start it
every morning - "Is Tom Jones here?"

35:56.170 --> 36:01.490
You actually live in the exhaust
pipes! The lap, how did it go?

36:01.490 --> 36:07.210
Great. But I hadn't been clutching
and changing since the '60s.

36:07.210 --> 36:12.210
That bloody car that I was driving,
it grinds when you slam it.

36:12.210 --> 36:15.530
Anyway, I was having
a few words with it.

36:15.530 --> 36:19.850
Yes. Stig says you were
an incredibly diligent pupil.

36:19.850 --> 36:24.130
You apparently were an hour
and a half getting lessons.

36:24.130 --> 36:28.050
I wanted to be sure how to do it,
especially at that kind of speed.

36:28.050 --> 36:33.450
There are a few places there where
you're in fourth gear and flat out.

36:33.450 --> 36:36.650
Follow-through. You know why
it's called a follow-through?

36:36.650 --> 36:37.890
Cos you follow through!

36:37.890 --> 36:40.170
LAUGHTER

36:40.170 --> 36:43.490
And then the tyres,
because that's also flat out. Yeah.

36:43.490 --> 36:48.410
I can't believe I'm sitting here
talking cornering with Tom Jones,
how could this have happened?

36:48.410 --> 36:50.890
Anyway, who'd like
to see Sir Tom's lap?

36:50.890 --> 36:52.610
CHEERING

36:52.610 --> 36:55.130
Let's play the tape
and see how you got on.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.650
It's a bright, crisp day.
A very good start.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.490
HE GRUNTS
OK!

37:00.490 --> 37:01.970
There we go!

37:04.650 --> 37:09.050
That's first, first! Yeah.

37:09.050 --> 37:12.050
There was one in there somewhere.

37:14.370 --> 37:16.370
Tidy, nothing wrong with that.

37:16.370 --> 37:18.450
Nothing wrong with the first corner.

37:18.450 --> 37:20.650
BLEEP!

37:20.650 --> 37:22.370
LAUGHTER

37:25.450 --> 37:28.490
There we go. Swearing at his tools.

37:29.890 --> 37:30.930
Brake!

37:30.930 --> 37:32.810
Good plan, very good plan.

37:38.770 --> 37:40.850
You can be proud of that corner.

37:42.450 --> 37:44.170
Here's the fast one coming up.

37:44.170 --> 37:45.850
Are they driving gloves? Yeah.

37:47.650 --> 37:51.050
Look at this!
Flat through the tyres.

37:51.050 --> 37:53.850
Here we go. Looking nervous!

37:53.850 --> 37:57.130
Whoa! That's very good!

37:57.130 --> 38:00.450
Yeah. Hang on,
you've slowed down a bit.

38:00.450 --> 38:02.250
It's a good line through there.

38:02.250 --> 38:07.210
A bit wide through there,
but other than the last two corners,

38:07.210 --> 38:08.250
that's a great lap.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.770
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:14.130 --> 38:20.210
So, these are the people
who have been here before.

38:20.210 --> 38:23.250
Where do you think you've come?

38:23.250 --> 38:25.530
I don't know, I've no idea.

38:25.530 --> 38:28.930
I was concentrating so much, I wasn't
thinking much about time.

38:28.930 --> 38:32.130
You weren't thinking about time.
Let's have a look, shall we?

38:32.130 --> 38:37.050
The last two corners weren't fast,
so I'm not anticipating...

38:37.050 --> 38:40.410
You did it, Tom Jones,

38:40.410 --> 38:45.890
in 1.52.2, which puts you...there.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.890
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:53.210 --> 38:56.690
Let's look for some good news
in that. OK.

38:56.690 --> 39:00.330
Has anybody who has ever performed
in Vegas been faster than that?

39:00.330 --> 39:04.010
Will Young, has he ever performed
in Vegas? I don't think so.

39:04.010 --> 39:06.210
He's a nice chap.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.650
LAUGHTER

39:08.650 --> 39:12.490
I don't think there's anybody there
who has ever performed in Vegas.

39:12.490 --> 39:17.130
You're the fastest man who's ever
performed in Vegas to go round
our track. Sir Tom Jones!

39:17.130 --> 39:19.450
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:26.250 --> 39:28.890
Now, you may remember
that last year,

39:28.890 --> 39:31.370
Fifth Gear broke into our warehouse,

39:31.370 --> 39:34.130
where we keep all our stuff,
and they burnt it.

39:34.130 --> 39:37.290
Our chairs, the telly,
the cool wall, the lot.

39:37.290 --> 39:41.730
Well, the Chinese say
revenge is a dish best served cold.

39:41.730 --> 39:46.610
So we've bided our time and now,
we're about to get our own back.

39:46.610 --> 39:48.210
Hopefully.

39:48.210 --> 39:52.930
Our payback will be carried out here,
at Bentwaters in Suffolk.

39:52.930 --> 39:58.050
This is the Top Gear test track
we don't mind getting all messed up.

39:58.050 --> 40:03.650
And the man making that mess will be
our old and indestructible friend,
Top Gear's stuntman.

40:05.850 --> 40:09.930
Today, he'll be doing
something which appears to be
straightforward - a jump.

40:09.930 --> 40:13.890
And it should be one heck of a jump.

40:13.890 --> 40:19.970
This stunt is, in all seriousness,
the biggest, the fastest and
most dangerous he's ever done for us.

40:19.970 --> 40:22.050
You see, a few years ago,

40:22.050 --> 40:28.810
Fifth Gear set the record
for the longest jump by a car
whilst pulling a caravan.

40:28.810 --> 40:31.450
Now, with a fair wind
and hopefully enough bottle

40:31.450 --> 40:34.410
from out stuntman, we'll snatch
that record off them.

40:34.410 --> 40:37.970
The distance he has to beat
is a whopper -

40:37.970 --> 40:45.410
187 feet and eight inches - which is
why this jump is so dangerous.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.170
He's got to be going fast enough
to get a good launch

40:48.170 --> 40:51.170
and offset the weight of the caravan
hanging off the back.

40:51.170 --> 40:54.450
By someone else's calculations -
not his, or mine -

40:54.450 --> 40:57.850
he's got to be doing 90mph when he
leaves the ramp.

40:57.850 --> 41:04.330
At that sort of speed, there's a real
danger that both car and driver
could be wiped out.

41:04.330 --> 41:07.610
Which is why we haven't spent much
on the car -

41:07.610 --> 41:13.570
400 quid, in fact,
on this 16-year-old Jaguar XJ6.

41:13.570 --> 41:16.370
Then there's the issue of crosswinds.

41:16.370 --> 41:20.170
If one of those hits
the caravan at these speeds,
it could drift off course

41:20.170 --> 41:24.770
and smash into the concrete,
rather than land on the cars.

41:24.770 --> 41:26.770
That could ruin the result.

41:26.770 --> 41:33.130
And the result we're looking for
is that he lands somewhere beyond
the yellow and black pole.

41:33.130 --> 41:36.570
This is the distance Fifth Gear
achieved with their jump.

41:36.570 --> 41:38.490
All we've got to do is beat that.

41:38.490 --> 41:41.090
Easy...probably.

41:41.090 --> 41:46.970
With the crosswind measuring a
manageable 12mph, Top Gear stuntman

41:46.970 --> 41:52.210
did some final technical checks
and was then strapped into the Jag.

42:03.570 --> 42:04.930
He needs a long run-up.

42:21.770 --> 42:25.770
Well, if you look
where the pole is, he failed.

42:27.370 --> 42:31.970
But to make sure he failed, let's
see it again from several angles.

42:48.410 --> 42:52.330
Yep. Fifth Gear
are still better than us.

42:54.770 --> 42:57.770
Sorry, we let you down. Well, he did.

42:59.370 --> 43:01.130
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:01.130 --> 43:05.050
Well done, professor.
Another triumph, it really is.

43:11.330 --> 43:14.570
But it wasn't, actually. So let's
move it on to the glittering,

43:14.570 --> 43:19.450
star-studded Top Gear Awards
For Motoring Achievement 2008.

43:19.450 --> 43:21.450
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:24.330 --> 43:28.290
This is the award for
the Best Noise We've Heard All Year.

43:28.290 --> 43:34.010
These are the nominations. The V8
bellow of the new Mercedes CLK Black.

43:34.010 --> 43:36.130
ENGINE ROARS

43:39.370 --> 43:42.410
The V8 bellow
of the Ferrari Scuderia.

43:42.410 --> 43:44.410
ENGINE ROARS

43:46.770 --> 43:49.730
And the V8 bellow
of the Alfa Romeo 8C.

43:49.730 --> 43:51.730
ENGINE ROARS

43:51.730 --> 43:53.730
The winner of this category...

43:53.730 --> 43:56.330
You're going to love this, Jeremy.
Is it the Black?

43:56.330 --> 43:58.210
No, actually. The winner is...

43:58.210 --> 44:01.450
Will Young's new single! YES!

44:01.450 --> 44:02.730
Yes!

44:07.850 --> 44:11.450
He wells up when he hears this.
Those are real tears in his eyes.

44:11.450 --> 44:13.650
These are tears of rage.

44:13.650 --> 44:15.370
You love him, just admit it.

44:15.370 --> 44:18.530
No. You do. It is a good single,
actually. Have you heard it?

44:18.530 --> 44:20.490
See? He goes on about it
all the time!

44:20.490 --> 44:22.890
Because his boyfriend
sung a little song...

44:22.890 --> 44:25.730
Just let's...
Does he sing it to you? Does he?

44:25.730 --> 44:28.210
Can we get on with our awards?

44:28.210 --> 44:32.010
And now, the John Sergeant Award.

44:32.010 --> 44:35.650
This is awarded to the celebrity
who performs the best dance

44:35.650 --> 44:39.450
on learning their time in the Star
In A Reasonably-Priced Car Lap.

44:39.450 --> 44:43.450
There is only one nomination,
and it's Jay Kay, for this -

44:48.930 --> 44:52.010
And the winner is...Jay Kay! Yes!

44:52.010 --> 44:54.010
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:58.010 --> 45:02.410
Tell you what, mate,
since you're actually here...

45:02.410 --> 45:05.570
Merry Christmas.
Nice to see you. Merry Christmas.

45:05.570 --> 45:09.610
Since you're actually here, Jay,
we can give you your other award.

45:09.610 --> 45:11.210
James has it and it's for...

45:11.210 --> 45:15.890
It's the award for the Fastest Lap
and it goes to Mr Kay. Thank you.

45:15.890 --> 45:22.250
The fastest man round our track,
ladies and gentlemen...Jay Kay!

45:22.250 --> 45:24.170
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:26.730 --> 45:29.730
That's lovely. You actually spent
some money on that.

45:29.730 --> 45:32.810
No, we didn't. No, we haven't.
A couple of weeks ago,

45:32.810 --> 45:39.290
were you watching when Kevin McLeod
came here and I sat and went,
"You did it in 145 point..."?

45:39.290 --> 45:43.370
What that the shape of your bottom
when you thought you were
going to be beaten?

45:43.370 --> 45:47.690
I have to say, I started off on
the sofa like this, and ended up...

45:49.570 --> 45:51.530
Could you tell it was a quick lap?

45:51.530 --> 45:54.130
Yeah, you could see it was.
Where did he come from?

45:54.130 --> 45:57.290
He came from Grand Designs
and damn nearly... Unbelievable!

45:57.290 --> 46:00.970
He says he's not done any driving
before, so it's just raw talent.

46:00.970 --> 46:03.530
That's a load of bollocks!

46:03.530 --> 46:07.730
Ladies and gentlemen, the fastest
man round our track, Jay Kay.

46:07.730 --> 46:09.730
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

46:16.290 --> 46:23.850
Moving on. This is the award
for the Most Painful Injury
To A Motoring-Related Body Part.

46:23.850 --> 46:27.770
Jeremy's neck in the Nissan GTR.

46:29.090 --> 46:31.330
Whoa! Yes!

46:31.330 --> 46:33.290
Aagh!

46:33.290 --> 46:37.170
Quite a powerful contender.
The next nomination - Jeremy's neck

46:37.170 --> 46:40.290
in the "driving a truck
through a brick wall" bit.

46:47.090 --> 46:49.930
LAUGHTER

46:49.930 --> 46:54.250
Sorry, Different response.
Very different reactions there. Yes.

46:54.250 --> 46:56.890
Obviously different,
the reactions to that.

46:56.890 --> 47:02.970
Because we need a third nomination,
Jeremy's flick on the ear just then.

47:02.970 --> 47:07.170
I'm sure that was very nasty. That
hurt! That was the third nomination.

47:07.170 --> 47:10.490
Actually, it isn't the winner,
because the winner of the award

47:10.490 --> 47:14.610
for the Most Painful Injury To
A Motoring-Related Body Part is...

47:14.610 --> 47:16.810
Max Mosley's bottom.

47:16.810 --> 47:18.330
LAUGHTER

47:18.330 --> 47:21.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:21.010 --> 47:24.010
We might be in the law courts!

47:25.930 --> 47:28.330
Moving on to our next award.

47:28.330 --> 47:32.730
It is now the Most Embarrassing
Flirting On Television award.

47:32.730 --> 47:34.490
LAUGHTER

47:36.050 --> 47:41.170
In third place, James May,
for this fantastic, sonorous approach

47:41.170 --> 47:45.370
when presented with two girls
during our Alfa Romeo trip
through Warwickshire.

47:45.370 --> 47:48.930
I have been rescued
and I haven't even broken down.

47:48.930 --> 47:51.170
Well, then you don't get... Hello.

47:51.170 --> 47:53.810
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

47:58.690 --> 48:03.210
James, what was that?
That's the worst, it really is.
I'd forgotten how bad it was.

48:03.210 --> 48:06.210
You have to start with "Hello".

48:06.210 --> 48:10.530
What's next? In second place,
Jeremy Clarkson,

48:10.530 --> 48:13.690
for this inept charm offensive
on an American girl

48:13.690 --> 48:15.570
in our studio, only the other week.

48:15.570 --> 48:18.410
American. You're American?

48:18.410 --> 48:20.730
You can't be.
You're nowhere near fat enough!

48:22.010 --> 48:25.530
It was direct. It was a compliment.
Is that flattering?

48:25.530 --> 48:29.770
It was a compliment.
But that's not the winning entry,
because the winner is...

48:29.770 --> 48:32.930
Jeremy Clarkson interviewing
Will Young. Here he is.

48:34.610 --> 48:35.970
Let's have a look.

48:35.970 --> 48:42.530
Let's remind ourselves of when
the magic first bloomed for us all.
Here it is.

48:42.530 --> 48:45.410
I've got arms like pipe cleaners.
You're trim. No, not trim.

48:45.410 --> 48:47.890
Fit. Not fit!
I'm saying all the wrong things!

48:47.890 --> 48:51.010
Strong.
THEY LAUGH

48:51.010 --> 48:53.570
You giggled!
You're giggling. That was a giggle.

48:57.130 --> 49:02.050
Who here would like to see Richard
Hammond strangled on television?

49:02.050 --> 49:03.570
You giggled! You did giggle.

49:03.570 --> 49:07.930
Time for
our Coveted Car Of The Year.

49:07.930 --> 49:12.850
We're not just looking for a car
we all like, because then
it would be a Range Rover...again.

49:12.850 --> 49:15.330
So this year,
we decided to award the award

49:15.330 --> 49:19.290
to a car that does things better
than cars which cost a lot more.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.050
So the nominations are -

49:21.050 --> 49:25.610
the Nissan GTR, which goes round
the Nurburgring

49:25.610 --> 49:30.370
faster than a 911 Turbo,
but costs half as much.

49:32.130 --> 49:34.970
The Ford Fiesta.
Makes a perfect landing craft

49:34.970 --> 49:41.010
and for a lot less
than the £1.2 million jet boats
the Royal Marines use at the moment.

49:43.850 --> 49:46.090
And the Fiat 500 Abarth,

49:46.090 --> 49:52.130
for being everything you want
in a £100,000 car for just 13,500.

49:52.130 --> 49:56.730
But we've awarded the ultimate
Top Gear prize to a £35,000 car

49:56.730 --> 50:01.730
that came here and smashed the
Bugatti Veyron's £1 million face in.

50:01.730 --> 50:05.850
It's dweeby, geeky, ugly, old
and none of us would have one
in a million years.

50:05.850 --> 50:10.890
But it is our Car Of The Year.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Caterham R500.

50:10.890 --> 50:12.890
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

50:19.130 --> 50:23.170
The marvellous thing about awarding
this car our top prize

50:23.170 --> 50:28.050
is that we can now look,
once again, at that incredible lap

50:28.050 --> 50:31.050
it did last week at the hands
of the Stig. Here we go.

50:31.050 --> 50:33.410
Look at the way it corners!

50:33.410 --> 50:37.330
This is proper, old-fashioned
racing car handling. It's not grip.

50:37.330 --> 50:41.010
Look at that.
You actually have to drive that car.

50:41.010 --> 50:44.450
If the Stig feels happiness,
I don't think he's ever been happier.

50:44.450 --> 50:46.850
That is the perfect Stig car.
Look at it.

50:46.850 --> 50:50.330
You're steering on the throttle,
you're steering on the wheel.

50:50.330 --> 50:53.050
My favourite is when
he comes out of Hammerhead.

50:53.050 --> 50:56.690
Coming out of Hammerhead, just
watch - a four-wheel drift. Ready?

50:56.690 --> 50:59.970
Look at that. That's like an
old-fashioned racer. Brilliant.

50:59.970 --> 51:05.530
So there we are, everybody.
Top Gear's Car Of The Year.

51:05.530 --> 51:06.850
A wonderful thing.

51:06.850 --> 51:08.930
I'm delighted.
I think it's all right.

51:08.930 --> 51:13.970
A horrible car. To look at, it is.
But it's brilliant.

51:13.970 --> 51:17.290
This has been a little bit of
a mad show, ladies and gentlemen.

51:17.290 --> 51:20.850
So I thought I would introduce
a note of sensibleness.

51:20.850 --> 51:27.450
In the last series, we talked about
a car which we said would be the
most important one for 100 years.

51:27.450 --> 51:29.970
Back then, we could only
show you a picture of it.

51:29.970 --> 51:33.290
But now, it's ready for driving,
so I've been doing just that.

51:36.210 --> 51:42.410
First, I had to fly to Los Angeles,
which, as we know from the song,
is a great big freeway.

51:42.410 --> 51:48.410
That makes it the perfect place
to test the most important car
since the car was invented.

51:48.410 --> 51:51.730
Here it is.
It's called the FCX Clarity,

51:51.730 --> 51:55.490
and, I'm afraid,
it's a four-door Honda.

51:55.490 --> 51:59.250
But if Raymond Baxter, God rest him,
were here with us today,

51:59.250 --> 52:05.850
he'd be wearing a perfectly cut suit
and he'd be saying that this is
the future of motoring.

52:08.450 --> 52:13.730
That's certainly not because of
the way it looks, because it looks
just like a car.

52:13.730 --> 52:17.010
There's more normality, too.

52:17.010 --> 52:20.530
It doesn't drive itself.
It doesn't levitate.

52:20.530 --> 52:24.010
This is remarkably like
driving around in a Honda.

52:26.250 --> 52:31.970
What the Clarity is is an electric
car, but it's nothing like the Tesla
that Jeremy drove earlier.

52:31.970 --> 52:37.530
In fact, it's nothing like any
electric car we've ever seen before.

52:37.530 --> 52:41.450
The front wheels are driven by
a perfectly normal electric motor.

52:41.450 --> 52:45.010
But there are no batteries.

52:45.010 --> 52:50.810
Instead, this car
has its own on-board
electricity generating station.

52:50.810 --> 52:53.650
That takes the form
of a hydrogen fuel cell.

52:56.090 --> 52:58.650
Now, viewers, you'd better
brace yourselves -

52:58.650 --> 53:02.130
either that or turn over to the soft
porn and Nazi sharks on Channel 5 -

53:02.130 --> 53:05.250
because I'm about
to explain all this.

53:06.210 --> 53:11.010
At the back of the car is a
fuel tank exactly where you'd
expect it to be, but instead of

53:11.010 --> 53:15.250
filling it with petrol or diesel, it
is filled with compressed hydrogen.

53:15.250 --> 53:19.090
This hydrogen is combined
with oxygen from the air
in the fuel cell.

53:19.090 --> 53:22.890
In a rather complicated and
boring way, that makes electricity.

53:22.890 --> 53:26.330
That electricity is then used
to drive the electric motor,

53:26.330 --> 53:31.130
which turns the front wheels,
like it might do in a perfectly
normal front-wheel-drive car.

53:31.130 --> 53:35.050
The whole process is controlled...
Ahem!

53:35.050 --> 53:40.690
The whole process is controlled by a
box of electronics under the bonnet
where the engine would normally be.

53:40.690 --> 53:42.930
That really is all there is to it.

53:44.490 --> 53:47.690
It's the fuel cell and
the hydrogen tank that goes with it

53:47.690 --> 53:51.730
league to every other electric car.

53:54.490 --> 53:59.090
So far, most electric cars have been
appalling little plastic snot boxes

53:59.090 --> 54:03.690
that take all night to recharge
and take half a minute to reach
their maximum speed of 40,

54:03.690 --> 54:06.050
and then run out of juice
miles from anywhere.

54:09.370 --> 54:11.210
Prius? Sucker!

54:14.610 --> 54:19.090
But when the Clarity runs out
of juice, you just pull into
a hydrogen filling station.

54:19.090 --> 54:22.490
The hydrogen is compressed into a
liquid, so it's a bit like petrol.

54:22.490 --> 54:26.410
You fill it just like a petrol car.

54:26.410 --> 54:32.210
The only difference is,
because this is under pressure,
you have to lock it with this lever.

54:32.210 --> 54:36.770
Terribly important, that.
If you don't do that, you get
hydrogen all over your shoes.

54:36.770 --> 54:42.370
In America, hydrogen costs
roughly the same as petrol.

54:42.370 --> 54:48.250
But unlike petrol, it'll never
run out, because it's the most
abundant element in the universe.

54:48.250 --> 54:53.970
That whole process
has taken somewhere between
two and three minutes

54:53.970 --> 54:56.770
and has given me
another 270 miles of driving.

54:59.290 --> 55:02.650
And there's another bonus
with hydrogen.

55:02.650 --> 55:09.970
The only emission from this car is
water, because that's what you get
when you mix H and O. H2O - water.

55:12.370 --> 55:18.010
Of course, I'm not going to pretend
that a four-door saloon is
as much fun to drive as that Tesla.

55:18.010 --> 55:20.210
But that said,
the Clarity isn't bad.

55:20.210 --> 55:24.490
I mean, it develops 136 horsepower.

55:24.490 --> 55:27.410
So this is an electric car
that will do 100 miles an hour

55:27.410 --> 55:33.170
and 0-60 in just over nine seconds,
which is right on the money
for a family car.

55:34.090 --> 55:38.850
We're belting through
the mountains, accompanied by
a little "whoo" sound!

55:41.690 --> 55:45.850
This is making my blue ball go
all orange. I should probably
explain that.

55:45.850 --> 55:52.450
On the dash, there is this little
blue circular symbol, which grows,
the more vigorously I drive.

55:52.450 --> 55:56.450
The bigger it is,
the more hydrogen I'm using.
If I put the hammer down...

55:56.450 --> 55:58.090
..it turns orange.

56:01.090 --> 56:04.210
At the moment, the Clarity
is only available in California.

56:04.210 --> 56:10.010
So I decided to ask
an ordinary Californian motorist
what he thought of it.

56:12.930 --> 56:15.250
Mind you, this chap
does seem to like his cars.

56:19.250 --> 56:21.290
He's American talk-show host
Jay Leno.

56:22.970 --> 56:25.570
This is my favourite ad.

56:25.570 --> 56:30.770
D'you notice, the car is skidding
off the road in their own ad? That's
how bad handling a car it was!

56:32.690 --> 56:38.290
I'm trying to come up with a bit of
a set-up like this next to my house,
albeit quite a bit smaller.

56:38.290 --> 56:43.090
'It turns out that Jay, like me,
is a fan of the Clarity, not just

56:43.090 --> 56:49.050
'because it's clever, but because
it might just be the saviour of all
the amazing gas guzzlers in here.'

56:50.650 --> 56:54.570
Car enthusiasts would think,
"This'll be awful."
No, it'll save the petrol.

56:54.570 --> 56:58.850
It'll save your MG or your Sprite
or your Midget or whatever you have.

56:58.850 --> 57:02.970
You go out on the weekend
and have fun and put this
in the car park during the week.

57:02.970 --> 57:06.410
Much like the automobile
was the saviour of the horse.

57:06.410 --> 57:11.050
In the cities, at least in America,
horses were being whipped
and they'd drop dead.

57:11.050 --> 57:15.170
When the car came along,
it freed up a horse to be used
for recreational purposes,

57:15.170 --> 57:18.210
just the beauty of the animal,
whatever you want to call it.

57:18.210 --> 57:24.610
I think these type of cars will be
the saviour of our sports cars -
our MGs, Porsches, things like that.

57:24.610 --> 57:30.370
You know how the Toyota Prius is
the sort of darling of Hollywood?
It's a fashion statement.

57:30.370 --> 57:33.530
Do you know why? Because it has
the moral superiority.

57:33.530 --> 57:39.610
With the Prius, you can go, "Look,
I am driving an unattractive car
because I'm saving the planet."

57:39.610 --> 57:44.170
In America, we like everyone
to know about the good work
we're doing anonymously.

57:49.970 --> 57:55.770
I'm absolutely convinced
that the Clarity is the most
important car for 100 years.

57:55.770 --> 58:00.570
There's a very good reason for that.
One day, we will, sadly,
run out of oil,

58:00.570 --> 58:03.090
and then we'll need something else.

58:03.090 --> 58:05.730
Electric cars have always seemed
very promising,

58:05.730 --> 58:09.010
but as long as they're powered
by batteries, they don't cut it.

58:09.010 --> 58:11.730
Think of all people down there,
driving around.

58:11.730 --> 58:15.970
We've built our lives
around the car as we know it.

58:15.970 --> 58:20.170
You get in, you drive as far
as you want to go, you fill up,
you drive some more.

58:20.170 --> 58:23.770
That is the freedom
that a petrol-powered car gives you.

58:23.770 --> 58:27.050
If it's replaced with something
that goes for ten yards

58:27.050 --> 58:31.450
and then takes four hours
to bring back to life,
we'll have gone backwards.

58:31.450 --> 58:34.330
The Clarity, though, is different.

58:34.330 --> 58:37.250
It fits the life we already have.

58:37.250 --> 58:42.370
The reason it's the car of
the future is because it's just like
the car of today.

58:47.850 --> 58:49.850
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

58:54.170 --> 58:57.130
So we can think of that car
as a normal car.

58:57.130 --> 59:02.650
But instead of filling it up
with petrol or diesel,
you fill it with hydrogen. Exactly.

59:02.650 --> 59:05.530
And all that comes out
of the exhaust pipe is water.

59:05.530 --> 59:10.170
Just water. In fact,
the only problem with it, really,
is producing the hydrogen.

59:10.170 --> 59:14.730
It is the most abundant thing
in the universe, but it's always
stuck onto something else,

59:14.730 --> 59:18.170
and it's difficult to scrape off
and get to the filling station.

59:18.170 --> 59:24.450
Actually, it isn't really any more
difficult than drilling oil from
under the sea, and we did that OK.

59:24.450 --> 59:28.130
I presume when they make these
things, they won't cost any more

59:28.130 --> 59:29.890
than what we think of
as a normal car.

59:29.890 --> 59:33.450
No, possibly less. I actually think
they'll be much more reliable

59:33.450 --> 59:37.010
and won't need to be serviced,
because there are no moving parts.

59:37.010 --> 59:40.690
Just one moving part, in the engine?
It's very simple, mechanically.

59:40.690 --> 59:45.170
So while everyone worried about
Honda pulling out of Formula One,
They've saved the world!

59:45.170 --> 59:48.290
It would appear so.
That is all we have time for.

59:48.290 --> 59:55.930
We're back on 28th December at
8pm - it's a Sunday night - with
a Top Gear special from Vietnam.

59:55.930 --> 59:59.130
In the meantime, though, we hope
you have a very happy Yule.

59:59.130 --> 01:00:01.010
Take care. See you soon. Good night.
