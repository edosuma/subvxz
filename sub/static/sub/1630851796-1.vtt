WEBVTT

00:07.416 --> 00:08.500
Hear me out.

00:08.583 --> 00:12.416
Favela City. We're all on a journey,
following our dreams.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.166
Hey, Netflix. Come on!

00:14.250 --> 00:15.666
We need more rhythm.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.083
I got this.

00:17.166 --> 00:20.416
Drop the beat, Netflix.
This is our laid-back recap.

00:21.541 --> 00:25.333
Don't even try to remember
It's been more than two years

00:25.416 --> 00:27.041
Sintonia is back for good

00:27.125 --> 00:30.750
The thing is I forgot everything
Pay attention to our recap

00:30.833 --> 00:33.041
We're hustling
That's who we are

00:33.125 --> 00:34.916
Jesus, have mercy on my soul.

00:36.208 --> 00:40.666
Doni wrote a hit
But messed it up and lost it

00:40.750 --> 00:43.500
Short-tempered Nando stood up for him

00:43.583 --> 00:48.000
Dondoka threw a curveball
And got herself in a collab

00:48.083 --> 00:51.041
Listen up, hear me out

00:51.125 --> 00:55.416
Rita took a beating and ran to Sueli

00:55.500 --> 00:58.208
And now everything's been forgiven

00:58.291 --> 01:02.541
Nando did the crime a service
And put Ganso to sleep

01:02.625 --> 01:05.708
But the shit hit the fan

01:05.791 --> 01:07.791
If you go to jail, we're screwed.

01:11.875 --> 01:13.625
I wanna be part of this house.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.333
-Are you baptized?
-Not yet.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.291
Wake up, Dad!

01:19.125 --> 01:20.041
Dad!

01:20.125 --> 01:24.583
There are things I'd rather not recall
Mr. Chico's death still haunts me

01:24.666 --> 01:28.041
Our grocery shop can't close
I'll forever remember Dad

01:28.125 --> 01:32.166
But at least we're still together
The season went on and ended like this

01:32.250 --> 01:33.875
Sup, family!

01:37.000 --> 01:41.166
Doni signed a contract
And will do a lot of gigs

01:41.250 --> 01:44.125
A lot of gigs

01:44.208 --> 01:48.500
Rita was baptized
And will continue in the church

01:48.583 --> 01:51.541
Praying all the time

01:51.625 --> 01:55.750
Nando was sworn into the brotherhood
That's Badá calling him

01:55.833 --> 01:58.625
A whole lot of shit to take care of

01:58.708 --> 02:03.041
If things get ugly
You gotta talk yourself out of it

02:03.125 --> 02:06.291
We're Sintonia, show some respect

02:08.458 --> 02:11.291
That was Sintonia's recap.

02:11.375 --> 02:13.583
Ready for the second season?

02:19.041 --> 02:21.000
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:21.083 --> 02:22.958
BASED ON THE ORIGINAL IDEA BY KONDZILLA

02:24.666 --> 02:27.250
-You look nervous.
-Are you sure about this?

02:27.333 --> 02:28.750
Don't be a baby, Doni.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.041
-Come on!
-I don't know, Rita…

02:33.500 --> 02:34.708
This won't work.

02:34.791 --> 02:36.958
It will be cool. Trust me.

02:38.875 --> 02:42.208
-Say the number.
-It's 274-3578.

02:42.291 --> 02:45.083
Good evening. I'd like to order a pizza.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.541
Half cheese, half pepperoni.

02:48.041 --> 02:51.541
And a soda. To 72 Buriti Lane.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.041
Thanks.

02:55.708 --> 02:56.541
Go, Doni.

02:57.541 --> 03:00.375
-I can't do it, Rita.
-Stop being a baby.

03:00.875 --> 03:03.708
-This won't end well.
-Go, Doni! Please!

03:08.583 --> 03:09.708
Say the number.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.958
It's 274-3578.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.166
Hello.

03:18.250 --> 03:19.916
Can I make an order?

03:26.291 --> 03:28.000
BURITI LANE

03:28.083 --> 03:29.416
DELIVERY

03:33.000 --> 03:34.250
Come on!

03:37.041 --> 03:38.291
How does it open?

03:38.375 --> 03:39.458
-Quick!
-Calm down!

03:41.291 --> 03:42.416
Take it!

03:42.500 --> 03:43.708
Take the pizza.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.125
Shit!

03:45.875 --> 03:46.958
Take it, Doni!

03:47.041 --> 03:48.125
Go!

03:48.208 --> 03:49.416
The soda!

03:49.500 --> 03:50.875
DELIVERY

03:51.708 --> 03:55.041
Tough guy comes by
thinking this is the Wild West.

03:55.666 --> 03:58.625
Hey, Juninho.
Show it to this piece of shit.

03:58.708 --> 04:00.458
Don't worry, Badá. I got it.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.916
This is a reminder. Hear me?

04:03.500 --> 04:07.416
For assholes like you
who think our turf is a free-for-all.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.708
That it's lawless.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.958
Hey, Nando! Watch this, kid.

04:12.041 --> 04:13.000
Please, man.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.125
Hey, this is what we do

04:15.208 --> 04:17.333
to robbers in our hood.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.083
-A soaked one won't break.
-Please, man!

04:21.166 --> 04:22.208
Please, man!

04:22.291 --> 04:23.958
Piece of shit!

04:24.750 --> 04:26.125
Fucking asshole!

04:26.958 --> 04:30.000
This pizza is dope
Pepperoni, mozzarella

04:30.083 --> 04:32.333
People say it's the best in the favela

04:32.416 --> 04:34.916
Delivery boy done goofed
We went for it

04:35.000 --> 04:37.875
The pizza is damn good
And Nando has arrived

04:37.958 --> 04:40.416
-How's it going, bro?
-Chilling.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.125
-And this pizza?
-Enjoy, bro. It's ours.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.958
-Where did you get it?
-We took it from a fool.

04:46.916 --> 04:47.958
What fool?

04:49.250 --> 04:50.333
What fool?

04:50.916 --> 04:53.500
Chill, Nando. Just some delivery guy.

04:54.583 --> 04:57.041
Do you know what happens to robbers here?

04:57.625 --> 04:58.875
Relax, Nando.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.291
They die.

05:02.208 --> 05:05.541
Why did you do that, man?
Your dad could've paid.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.166
It was just for fun.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.458
It's just one pizza.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.666
We may be that pizza guy one day.

05:16.791 --> 05:19.541
I'll be anything but a delivery person.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.250
You know I'll be a funk singer.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.375
What about you? A soccer player?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.208
Hell no. I'll run the shop.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.958
I hope it's not the pizza shop.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.583
-Have a slice, bro.
-Take it.

05:31.666 --> 05:32.958
Have one.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.875
-Take it.
-I'll get this one.

05:35.375 --> 05:36.333
Hey, guys.

05:36.416 --> 05:40.250
All these pizzas cost as much
as Rivaldo and I pay for our bike.

05:40.958 --> 05:43.125
The rich kid from the hood is what now?

05:43.208 --> 05:44.916
Billi, billi

05:45.666 --> 05:47.583
The billionaire from the hood.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.041
It's not just the pizzas.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.208
-He's got the style.
-Yeah, man.

05:52.291 --> 05:53.541
Look who's talking.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.583
You too, sis.
God worked a miracle on your clothes.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.500
Praise be!

06:00.083 --> 06:02.458
You know I fucking love you, right?

06:02.541 --> 06:05.833
I have news.
I've bought an apartment nearby.

06:05.916 --> 06:09.166
-Awesome!
-Very cool!

06:09.250 --> 06:10.250
Listen.

06:10.333 --> 06:13.583
I won't miss you
'cause I want you around all the time.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.833
-For sure!
-The grand opening is next week!

06:17.458 --> 06:19.166
Let's go!

06:26.875 --> 06:29.625
Family, it's been great,
but we have to go.

06:29.708 --> 06:33.250
Mom is already texting us.
She'll start calling soon and…

06:33.333 --> 06:35.250
-No worries.
-See you, guys.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.375
-Text when you get there.
-Sure.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.500
Take a look.

06:42.333 --> 06:44.000
Wow!

06:44.833 --> 06:46.875
-It's insane!
-Dope, bro.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.916
I gotta go see Bruna.

06:50.083 --> 06:50.916
Alright.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.541
Blowing money, man?

06:56.375 --> 06:58.166
You too. I saw your ride.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.500
Money doesn't last forever.

07:01.291 --> 07:02.125
Hear me?

07:02.625 --> 07:03.833
It eventually ends.

07:04.333 --> 07:07.291
It's the money you save
that makes you rich.

07:08.291 --> 07:10.500
I know. I'll start saving soon.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.666
My entire month is booked.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.333
And I don't owe anyone money.

07:15.916 --> 07:18.791
Remember the meeting.
Luan discovered everyone.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.583
-Revelação…
-Thiaguinho…

07:20.666 --> 07:23.458
-You said that a thousand times.
-It's true.

07:23.541 --> 07:24.875
Relax. We'll be there.

07:24.958 --> 07:25.875
Cool.

07:27.041 --> 07:28.041
Hold on.

07:32.333 --> 07:35.791
Bro, the load was late,
so I tracked it down.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.333
It was a police checkpoint.
They pulled us over.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.125
We couldn't get out of it.

07:41.958 --> 07:45.083
The driver was arrested.
We lost everything.

07:53.500 --> 07:59.333
THE COPS SEIZED THE ENTIRE LOAD

08:03.791 --> 08:04.750
What happened?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.250
Nothing. Just the usual.

08:08.875 --> 08:09.708
It's chill.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.125
Moving will be good for Doni.
I'm here for you.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.916
Just holler if you need anything.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.916
What's up?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.875
-Hey.
-Your dad would be so proud of you.

08:23.958 --> 08:25.375
No, he'd be scolding me.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.541
"Hard work brings respect, kid."

08:30.208 --> 08:31.291
We miss him.

08:31.375 --> 08:32.208
We sure do.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.125
It's been less than a year.

08:35.208 --> 08:36.041
-Yeah.
-Yes.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.041
You know how it is.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.750
Don't you miss your parents?

08:42.583 --> 08:43.708
You're my family.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.333
Speaking of family,

08:46.833 --> 08:48.833
today's my last day sitting on the pew.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.750
Tomorrow I'll be back in communion.

08:51.416 --> 08:55.166
I'm going to be there
for your reconciliation service.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.500
You bet I will.

08:56.583 --> 08:57.958
Thank you, Auntie.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.708
Family, time to take care of business.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.916
-You barely come here.
-Bye, son.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.625
Scheyla is coming. Want a ride?

09:05.708 --> 09:07.041
It's okay. I'll walk.

09:07.125 --> 09:10.083
-I'll give you a ride.
-Don't worry, Nando. Thanks.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.208
-Stay here. It's late.
-Yeah.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.833
No, thanks, guys. I'll go home.

09:14.916 --> 09:16.791
Got to get used to being

09:16.875 --> 09:18.541
the only one in Vila Áurea.

09:19.833 --> 09:21.208
So dramatic.

09:21.291 --> 09:22.791
No, stop it.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.375
I'm very proud of you.

09:25.583 --> 09:26.625
The two of you.

09:53.083 --> 09:53.916
How are you?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.458
Hello. We have an appointment with Luan.

09:56.541 --> 09:57.541
Just a sec.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.500
-Welcome, Doni.
-Thanks.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.625
Luan, this is Doni.

10:02.708 --> 10:05.125
He always says he wants to work with you.

10:05.208 --> 10:08.250
-That's right.
-Doni, nice to meet you. Luan.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.416
Likewise. I'm glad to be here.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.416
I did bust his balls about it.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.041
But it was your success that got you here.

10:15.125 --> 10:16.625
You're his agent, right?

10:16.708 --> 10:18.000
Luiz Fernando.

10:18.083 --> 10:21.083
It's important to have
someone you trust with you.

10:21.166 --> 10:24.041
I'll introduce you to our team.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.166
Ágatha, Duda, and Tati.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.541
That is Marcão, your producer.

10:28.625 --> 10:29.833
Hey, Doni.

10:29.916 --> 10:32.625
-So, Doni, an A-list crew, right?
-Hell yeah.

10:32.708 --> 10:36.375
And we're here to transform
your career into a solid one.

10:36.458 --> 10:37.291
Awesome.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.375
You'll go through media training,

10:39.458 --> 10:41.958
singing and acting lessons, body language…

10:42.041 --> 10:45.125
People will be lining up
to do a collab with you.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.333
Who would you like to sing with?

10:47.416 --> 10:48.916
Off the top of my head?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.041
-Lexa, Kevinho?
-Dream big, Doni. Go for it.

10:52.125 --> 10:53.916
Any of them. They're insane.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Tell him.

10:55.083 --> 10:58.583
You'll have a chat with them
in person this weekend.

10:58.666 --> 11:02.416
We've booked you on KondZilla Festival.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.333
For real?

11:03.416 --> 11:06.500
The thing is,
we only have three days to rehearse.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.083
Are you up for it?

11:09.958 --> 11:11.958
You can trust the boy will deliver.

11:12.041 --> 11:12.875
I'm down.

11:12.958 --> 11:14.708
Alright, then. Let's kill it.

11:14.791 --> 11:16.791
-Let's kill it.
-Let's kill it.

11:21.541 --> 11:25.500
I need you

11:25.583 --> 11:29.666
My beloved brethren

11:29.750 --> 11:33.666
You're so precious to me

11:33.750 --> 11:38.833
My beloved brethren

11:41.250 --> 11:43.916
This is a special part of our service.

11:45.041 --> 11:47.500
It's time for reconciliation.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.125
I'll call up on stage

11:51.208 --> 11:54.958
sisters and brothers who have sinned,

11:55.583 --> 11:59.625
but who ask for forgiveness
before the church, in the name of Jesus.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.833
-Hallelujah!
-Hallelujah!

12:01.916 --> 12:03.250
Rita,

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Sofia,

12:05.833 --> 12:06.666
Rodrigo.

12:12.250 --> 12:17.500
I hope you now understand
why I asked each one of you

12:17.583 --> 12:22.583
to sit and witness God
for the past three months.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.583
Reconciliation.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.083
It reconnects you.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.958
Reconnects you to Jesus.

12:39.041 --> 12:43.791
This time transforms
the brethren for life.

12:46.791 --> 12:49.375
-One line means negative.
-Watch.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.125
You must pray and watch.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.041
Like the Bible says,

12:55.458 --> 12:59.750
"Watch and pray,
lest you enter into temptation."

13:03.458 --> 13:08.250
You said we'd taken different paths,
but I'm right here.

13:08.833 --> 13:12.375
Why can't I call you,
text you to see how you're doing?

13:13.750 --> 13:17.125
This is the time for reconciliation.

13:17.708 --> 13:19.375
To wait in Christ.

13:20.208 --> 13:21.875
To start a new life

13:23.041 --> 13:26.500
and leave all your baggage behind.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.083
I made a life choice.

13:29.666 --> 13:32.500
If this happens every time we meet,

13:33.083 --> 13:34.333
I won't be following it.

13:36.375 --> 13:37.958
I'll just be fooling myself.

13:42.208 --> 13:43.500
We all make mistakes.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.750
My question is,

13:47.458 --> 13:52.208
does the church want to forgive
these sisters and this brother?

13:52.291 --> 13:53.333
-Amen!
-Amen!

13:53.416 --> 13:57.250
Does the church want these brethren back

13:57.333 --> 13:59.375
to the communion of the body of Christ?

13:59.458 --> 14:02.208
-Amen!
-Amen!

14:02.291 --> 14:05.958
Commitment to life

14:06.041 --> 14:09.250
Filled with Christ's love

14:09.333 --> 14:13.166
I need you

14:13.250 --> 14:16.958
My beloved brethren

14:17.041 --> 14:20.583
You're so precious to me

14:21.166 --> 14:26.375
My beloved brethren

14:26.458 --> 14:27.291
Amen.

14:27.916 --> 14:29.166
Hallelujah!

14:35.041 --> 14:35.916
Bro,

14:36.416 --> 14:37.833
listen to me.

14:38.666 --> 14:41.083
-This is big, man.
-It's huge, right?

14:41.166 --> 14:44.833
Now that you'll make big bucks,
you need real pros with you.

14:44.916 --> 14:46.666
Yeah. You're with me, right?

14:47.166 --> 14:48.666
We'll sort it out.

14:48.750 --> 14:52.083
He will be closer to you,
and I'll be the backup.

14:52.166 --> 14:55.541
No worries. You're doing really well too.

14:56.625 --> 14:59.375
Why don't you handle any pending business

14:59.458 --> 15:01.125
and live off music with me?

15:03.166 --> 15:04.250
Don't worry, Doni.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.458
I'm here, ain't I?

15:06.541 --> 15:07.583
Cool.

15:07.666 --> 15:09.541
Focus on the festival, bro.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.083
-I'd like to see Pastor Leopoldo.
-Come in!

15:13.583 --> 15:14.833
-Come in.
-Thanks.

15:15.416 --> 15:16.458
Excuse me, Pastor.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.000
-Hi, Pastor. How are you?
-Hello.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.000
I'd like to talk with you.

15:23.083 --> 15:26.416
Rita, I'm late to pick my son up
from the airport.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.833
Make it quick.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.291
I'd love to share my testimony
during Saturday's service.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.500
Levi texted me saying he's waiting.

15:33.583 --> 15:36.583
-We'll see. God be with you.
-God be with you.

15:36.666 --> 15:40.708
Rita, we're happy to have you back.
Follow the Lord's path.

15:40.791 --> 15:42.625
-One step at a time.
-I know.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.041
Please Jesus by doing his work.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.333
There is lots of volunteer work
you can do.

15:47.416 --> 15:51.000
I'm kind of short on time
because of my job at the mall.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.083
Everyone's got things to do.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.416
-I'm sorry, but I must go.
-Sure.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.666
-Let's go?
-Yeah.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.708
Morning, brother. How's everything?

16:07.791 --> 16:08.875
All good, partner.

16:09.541 --> 16:11.958
-How about you?
-I'm fine, brother.

16:12.041 --> 16:13.291
I'm getting the load.

16:13.958 --> 16:17.666
It's enough to pay Caneta
and start off the next month.

16:17.750 --> 16:18.583
Nice.

16:18.666 --> 16:21.416
That loss won't knock us down.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.458
We got lucky, but we spent big.

16:24.541 --> 16:26.125
Can't fuck up again.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.708
Cool, Badá. Good talk.

16:28.791 --> 16:29.625
Peace out.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.625
-Pastor, can we talk?
-What is it, child?

16:38.166 --> 16:39.666
I decided to go after my dad.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.000
Do you think it's a good idea?

16:48.125 --> 16:51.458
Remember what he did,
his marriage with your mother?

16:51.541 --> 16:53.458
I know. I remember.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.750
Rita, sometimes we want to take a path

16:56.833 --> 17:00.875
and believe God is pointing it out to us,
but it's not really him.

17:00.958 --> 17:01.958
Think about it.

17:02.041 --> 17:04.291
Your father left you
when you were a child.

17:04.791 --> 17:08.291
I've been thinking a lot
in the last three months.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.333
I've got to put some things to rest.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.500
I just think you need to be careful.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.041
Be prepared.

17:15.125 --> 17:18.041
You don't know who you'll find.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.416
Yeah. I've been praying a lot.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.375
Amen.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.625
-Hey, Marcão.
-What's up?

17:24.708 --> 17:26.291
-How's it going?
-All good?

17:26.375 --> 17:28.083
-Toncar Fi?
-Ton Carfi, man.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.958
-Can't believe you'll be my teacher.
-I love your songs, man!

17:32.041 --> 17:33.625
Have a seat, guys.

17:33.708 --> 17:38.208
We need to work on that voice
for the festival, right?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.875
It's fine. I'm used to festivals.

17:40.958 --> 17:44.250
But singing for 5,000
or 10,000 people is one thing.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.166
Imagine singing for a sea of people.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.500
You need to connect with them.

17:49.583 --> 17:54.208
Your voice has to reach everyone,
from the front row to the last.

17:54.291 --> 17:55.666
You gotta kill it.

17:55.750 --> 17:59.000
Your voice must resonate
in everyone's ears and hearts.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.916
-Let's make a difference?
-Yeah.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.166
Let's practice.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.958
Let's do this.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.250
-Alright.
-Yeah.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.166
Take this over there.

18:31.250 --> 18:32.708
Put it here.

18:32.791 --> 18:34.666
This one's ready.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.208
This one is good too.

18:41.916 --> 18:42.791
Move!

18:49.541 --> 18:51.541
Formiga, we scored two.

18:51.625 --> 18:52.750
Didn't even sweat.

18:53.458 --> 18:54.333
Yeah, player.

18:54.416 --> 18:56.250
Hurry up. No time to waste.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.875
Excuse me.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.541
Everything okay? Need any help?

19:01.625 --> 19:03.583
It's cool. We'll let you know.

19:03.666 --> 19:04.666
Word.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.958
-We done?
-Zip it up.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.666
It's over, boy. Move.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.416
You lost it, pal.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.333
Come here.

19:31.375 --> 19:32.375
Move.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.458
Down on the ground!

19:43.541 --> 19:44.875
Hands on your heads!

19:45.500 --> 19:48.291
-Move!
-On the ground.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.083
Against the wall!

19:50.166 --> 19:52.208
Look down if you wanna live.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.125
-On the ground!
-Let's go.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.583
-You lost it.
-Get down!

19:56.416 --> 19:57.750
Everyone on the ground!

19:57.833 --> 19:59.833
What are you looking at?

19:59.916 --> 20:01.875
-Down!
-Look up again and you die!

20:01.958 --> 20:03.083
Come on!

20:03.166 --> 20:04.041
You're dead!

20:04.583 --> 20:05.708
What the fuck?

20:06.208 --> 20:07.166
Another haul.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.208
I can't lose another load.

20:11.666 --> 20:12.791
What's up, man?

20:13.291 --> 20:14.416
Are you in charge?

20:14.500 --> 20:15.958
I asked you a question.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.125
We're the police, boy.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.458
Let's talk this out.

20:20.541 --> 20:21.541
Man to man.

20:23.375 --> 20:26.375
It's your lucky day.
I'm only taking the product.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.333
Move, guys. Take it all.

20:28.416 --> 20:30.083
Grab what you can.

20:30.166 --> 20:31.500
Take this shit.

20:31.583 --> 20:32.541
Quick!

20:32.625 --> 20:33.625
Come on!

20:34.458 --> 20:36.916
-Don't hang around.
-Come on!

20:37.000 --> 20:38.750
-Move!
-Go!

20:39.750 --> 20:40.625
Go!

20:41.583 --> 20:42.458
Move, man!

20:50.750 --> 20:52.875
Pick it all up. We're leaving!

20:53.375 --> 20:54.291
Move!

20:55.083 --> 20:57.625
Quick, before they come back!

21:05.166 --> 21:06.541
Sup, man. All good?

21:06.625 --> 21:08.416
No, bro. Shit went down.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.375
I hear you. What's up?
We'll work it out, homie.

21:12.458 --> 21:13.833
Spit it out. What happened?

21:14.333 --> 21:16.875
We got busted, Badá. They robbed us.

21:16.958 --> 21:20.458
-The police took it all.
-We lost another load? Fuck.

21:20.541 --> 21:22.166
Second fucking time.

21:22.250 --> 21:25.041
They didn't take anyone in
and didn't negotiate.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.291
-They took it all?
-Everything, Badá.

21:27.958 --> 21:30.166
We don't have enough for a week.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.833
Without drugs, the hood stops.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.541
So, do I reach out to Caneta?

21:34.625 --> 21:35.458
No.

21:35.541 --> 21:40.125
Not him. That batch is gone.
We were already on a deadline.

21:40.208 --> 21:42.875
-Who do we go after?
-We'll collect the bill.

21:42.958 --> 21:45.375
But we must be smart. You hear me?

21:45.458 --> 21:47.833
Let's take it easy and figure this out.

21:47.916 --> 21:51.500
We can't get ahead of ourselves,
or we will go down.

21:51.583 --> 21:54.875
We gotta keep the business going.

21:54.958 --> 21:58.333
When I first started,
I met a guy called Messinho.

21:58.416 --> 21:59.833
A business partner.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.750
He runs this shit.

22:01.833 --> 22:04.541
Caneta is a small fish. Reach out to him.

22:04.625 --> 22:07.708
Alright. I'll wait for your call, Badá.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.708
Cool. Take care, man.

22:09.791 --> 22:11.041
Sounds good, brother.

22:21.125 --> 22:23.958
-Thanks for coming with me.
-Don't mention it.

22:24.041 --> 22:25.708
I mean it. Thank you.

22:26.208 --> 22:29.041
It's good to get out of the house.

22:29.125 --> 22:31.208
And how are you doing?

22:31.291 --> 22:33.708
Rita, moving was great.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.875
Leave the hood, brand-new stuff…

22:37.208 --> 22:39.708
Groceries never cost less than a hundred.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.125
Good grief!

22:43.000 --> 22:46.541
I miss you guys.
I was glad Nando asked me to drive you.

22:48.375 --> 22:51.375
It's great that you're looking
for your father, Rita.

22:51.875 --> 22:53.500
I don't expect us to be close.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.625
I just want to put an end to this.

22:58.416 --> 23:01.375
I don't know. God knows what he's become.

23:06.583 --> 23:09.875
I know that you already dance,
and it's a basic routine,

23:09.958 --> 23:13.083
but we have a concert tomorrow,
so I need you to focus

23:13.166 --> 23:15.000
to get everything right, okay?

23:15.083 --> 23:18.083
-Okay.
-Let's go. Focus, Doni. Five, six…

23:24.458 --> 23:27.583
One, two, three, stop on four.

23:30.750 --> 23:33.250
Four, five, six, seven, jump on eight…

23:35.166 --> 23:36.666
Up and kick.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.583
Good.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.583
Arm, arm.

23:42.375 --> 23:43.250
Shake it.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.458
Good!

23:46.916 --> 23:49.458
It's when you move your hips.

23:49.541 --> 23:50.791
Eight beats.

23:51.291 --> 23:54.458
-One, two, three, four, five, six…
-I messed it up.

23:56.500 --> 24:00.166
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, jump, eight.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.041
One, two, three, four.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.916
Yes, very good!

24:09.583 --> 24:11.125
Good one!

24:11.208 --> 24:13.041
-Did I get it? God!
-Good job.

24:13.125 --> 24:14.500
-Tired?
-Yeah.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.208
-Get some water. Let's take a break.
-Thanks.

24:17.291 --> 24:20.708
Holy shit, man. Those girls can dance.

24:21.583 --> 24:24.208
-Totally.
-The routine is sick.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.625
Just keep the focus.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.958
Loosen your hips, man.

24:29.041 --> 24:32.375
Let's loosen those hips.
One, two, three, four.

24:32.458 --> 24:35.875
One, two, three, four. And hump.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.083
-Hump.
-Rivaldo.

24:37.166 --> 24:38.708
Chill. Are you crazy?

24:39.291 --> 24:41.791
-The girls can dance.
-The crew is dope.

24:42.541 --> 24:43.791
Very professional.

24:43.875 --> 24:47.416
It's time for you to show
that the king of the hood

24:47.500 --> 24:49.458
is a pop star, man!

24:56.375 --> 24:57.875
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

25:02.458 --> 25:04.458
Luiz Fernando, to see Messinho.

25:04.541 --> 25:06.375
-He's expecting you.
-Thank you.

25:15.541 --> 25:16.375
Messinho.

25:16.958 --> 25:18.375
-Nando.
-It's a pleasure.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.958
The pleasure is mine. Please.

25:22.875 --> 25:23.708
Thank you.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.708
-All good, brother?
-All good.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.333
What are you having? Beer, wine?

25:33.416 --> 25:34.833
Sparkling water is fine.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.416
Another one. Ice and lime, Nando?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.083
-Sure.
-Alright.

25:44.083 --> 25:45.500
So,

25:46.458 --> 25:47.875
Badá's godson.

25:49.125 --> 25:51.208
Been I while since I talked to him.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.583
We did time together in Mirandópolis.

25:54.666 --> 25:56.625
Badá is my godfather.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.583
-I'm grateful.
-Yeah, Badá's the real OG.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.125
He calls the shots.

26:05.541 --> 26:07.416
Fuck, man!

26:07.500 --> 26:08.583
END OF THE ROAD

26:08.666 --> 26:09.708
Check this out.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.625
More gossip, Rivaldo?

26:12.708 --> 26:15.916
-You're such a bonehead.
-Keeping up with the news.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.166
What does it say?

26:17.666 --> 26:19.541
MC Dondoka's career is over.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.791
She got lost in the character.

26:21.875 --> 26:26.166
She was paranoid and afraid to perform,
so she started drinking.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.666
Could only sing drunk.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.875
She was lucky to record with you.

26:31.416 --> 26:34.000
Alright. One more hour of rehearsal.

26:34.083 --> 26:36.083
-So you do a good job.
-Again?

26:36.166 --> 26:38.333
-Move, kid.
-Gotta work, bro.

26:45.833 --> 26:47.666
I think this is it.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.125
Number 190.

26:51.416 --> 26:52.791
I'll wait for you here.

26:53.375 --> 26:54.333
Thanks.

28:01.791 --> 28:02.791
Hi, Dad.

28:18.541 --> 28:20.000
PARKING

28:20.083 --> 28:23.000
In one month, we'll pay for the product.

28:23.083 --> 28:26.500
The shit's good.
People like it and recommend it.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.875
If you could help us stock our stores,
we'd appreciate it.

28:32.458 --> 28:33.458
Well said.

28:35.291 --> 28:37.625
I wish I was smart like you back then.

28:39.833 --> 28:42.541
But that's not how it goes, Nando.

28:44.833 --> 28:47.750
A man's word is not enough.
This is business.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.666
You already got stuff from Caneta.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.458
It's hard to give you that kind of credit.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.958
I can do 25% down payment.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.250
The bare minimum.

29:12.041 --> 29:14.791
I wish I could be more helpful.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.708
Take it, man.

29:20.333 --> 29:21.750
It's only 400.

29:22.833 --> 29:25.708
You can come up with it easily.

29:27.291 --> 29:28.333
Right?

29:29.375 --> 29:30.750
Meet me halfway.

29:33.166 --> 29:35.291
Pick the date, I'll bring the money.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.458
And lunch is on me.

29:39.791 --> 29:41.625
Relax, man.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.666
I own the restaurant.

29:46.125 --> 29:47.041
Deal.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.958
I don't know where to start.

30:24.458 --> 30:25.791
With your family.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.666
I should've gone after you.

30:38.458 --> 30:39.333
I know.

30:41.875 --> 30:42.875
But…

30:46.833 --> 30:48.000
I was weak.

30:51.625 --> 30:53.208
Rita, I left

30:53.791 --> 30:55.083
because

30:56.916 --> 30:57.958
I'd had enough.

30:58.708 --> 31:02.375
My life turned to hell
after what they did to me in the church.

31:04.375 --> 31:06.083
Everyone turned away from us.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.375
I didn't know what to do.

31:09.916 --> 31:12.083
I lost everything. No one helped.

31:16.583 --> 31:17.916
I felt

31:18.791 --> 31:19.750
abandoned,

31:20.541 --> 31:21.625
lost…

31:22.333 --> 31:23.500
Abandoned?

31:25.625 --> 31:29.166
Ever thought about Mom and how she felt?

31:30.250 --> 31:32.500
The only person who didn't reject you.

31:34.958 --> 31:36.416
She did not abandon you.

31:38.416 --> 31:41.083
Even though her life crumbled
by your side.

31:42.250 --> 31:45.833
I thought it was best for you two.

31:47.625 --> 31:50.833
You knew she was sick,
and you chose to leave.

31:50.916 --> 31:52.041
I didn't know.

31:52.916 --> 31:56.375
I swear, Rita.
When I left, she wasn't sick.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.375
I don't believe you.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.541
Remember how I was?

32:24.541 --> 32:26.541
Remember how our family was

32:27.125 --> 32:29.125
before this disgrace fell upon me?

32:34.916 --> 32:36.416
Do you know why I came?

32:42.083 --> 32:43.375
I wanted to see you.

32:46.250 --> 32:47.958
I just wanted to look at you.

32:49.166 --> 32:52.166
-I wanted to see you too.
-See how you were doing.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.666
I found out you have two daughters.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.458
Two beautiful daughters.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.375
And that you're still a selfish guy.

33:07.791 --> 33:11.291
Because you've only been making excuses
since I got here.

33:11.375 --> 33:14.416
You haven't listened to me
or asked how I'm doing.

33:20.833 --> 33:24.583
You abandoned a 14-year-old girl.

33:27.416 --> 33:28.541
Have you ever--

33:29.250 --> 33:31.208
Please, tell me.

33:31.916 --> 33:35.500
Have you ever thought
about what you did to me?

33:37.583 --> 33:40.125
How I struggled to survive on my own?

33:41.250 --> 33:43.375
Alone. I got by on my own.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.166
Rita, when I heard your mother had died,

33:48.833 --> 33:50.375
I wanted to come back.

33:50.458 --> 33:51.375
I tried.

33:54.166 --> 33:58.333
-I'm so ashamed. So much shame, my God!
-Maybe it was for the best.

34:05.416 --> 34:06.541
You are my father.

34:14.416 --> 34:15.541
I forgive you.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.833
Thanks for the coffee.

34:31.666 --> 34:32.625
Rita.

34:34.250 --> 34:35.208
Rita.

34:38.666 --> 34:39.625
Rita!

34:41.625 --> 34:42.625
Rita!

34:42.708 --> 34:44.375
We play all the time

34:44.458 --> 34:46.625
With those who stick up for me

34:46.708 --> 34:49.583
-I can count my true friends on one hand
-Rita!

34:50.500 --> 34:51.416
Come on, honey.

34:51.916 --> 34:54.166
I told you to be home before dark.

34:54.250 --> 34:55.083
It's late.

34:55.166 --> 34:57.083
-Sorry, Dad.
-Mom's waiting.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.166
See you.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.125
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

35:00.791 --> 35:03.458
Come, Doni. Chico must be worried.

35:04.708 --> 35:06.666
Where are you staying, Nando?

35:06.750 --> 35:08.666
Come, Nando. You can sleep over.

35:09.333 --> 35:11.708
I can't. I have to take care of Grandma.

35:11.791 --> 35:12.625
Cool.

35:13.416 --> 35:14.875
Go home, then.

35:20.625 --> 35:21.958
Is his grandma better?

35:22.458 --> 35:24.958
-He doesn't talk about it.
-No, Dad.

35:25.625 --> 35:26.583
No, Dad.

35:38.666 --> 35:41.208
-I'll make you some coffee.
-Thanks, Auntie.

35:44.458 --> 35:47.375
-We're almost done.
-Check this picture out.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.208
Pictures can be deceiving.

35:58.875 --> 36:00.000
He was gone in a year.

36:01.208 --> 36:03.541
But we're here with you,
like in the picture.

36:06.416 --> 36:09.125
Tomorrow is my testimony,
and I want you there.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.583
-We'll be there.
-But we will have to run.

36:12.666 --> 36:14.875
He's got the biggest concert
of his career.

36:14.958 --> 36:17.333
That's right!

36:17.416 --> 36:19.458
I hear the stage is huge.

36:19.541 --> 36:21.750
-You can play soccer on it.
-Insane.

36:22.916 --> 36:24.333
I'll be okay.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.750
It's a shame Dad is not here to see it.

37:41.666 --> 37:43.625
-Hey, partner.
-Hey, brother.

37:43.708 --> 37:46.250
All good? How did it go with Messinho?

37:46.333 --> 37:48.125
We talked, man.

37:48.208 --> 37:50.583
And I came up with a solution.

37:50.666 --> 37:52.750
Great, Nando. What is it?

37:53.541 --> 37:56.083
He's gonna hook us up with some product.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.666
But he demands a 25% down payment.

38:00.583 --> 38:01.500
Right.

38:02.458 --> 38:04.833
I figured if I turned up with the money,

38:04.916 --> 38:06.958
I'll restock your shops.

38:07.500 --> 38:08.375
I see.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.750
The money I'm putting in

38:11.416 --> 38:13.916
is worth what the shop on the steps makes.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.791
If you hand it over to me,

38:16.458 --> 38:18.541
we'll just call it quits.

38:19.958 --> 38:20.875
Deal?

38:27.666 --> 38:28.875
Badá, are you there?

39:37.833 --> 39:39.791
Fuck, how did you save all this money?

39:41.083 --> 39:42.916
I just don't splurge.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.083
Gotta be smart, you know?

39:50.125 --> 39:52.666
This was an emergency fund for my family.

39:55.458 --> 39:56.708
My wife, my daughter.

40:19.833 --> 40:20.916
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

40:25.958 --> 40:28.416
I'm calling up here a young woman

40:28.500 --> 40:31.250
who's been with us for some time.

40:31.333 --> 40:32.333
GOT THE 25?

40:32.416 --> 40:33.333
GOT IT

40:33.416 --> 40:35.916
Her testimony is very personal.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.125
I hope her testimony

40:39.208 --> 40:44.166
will help stimulate
and galvanize your faith.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.083
Come.

40:46.416 --> 40:47.333
Rita.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.041
Please.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.166
Thank you, Pastor.

41:04.333 --> 41:06.333
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

41:06.416 --> 41:08.875
Greetings. Lord be with you.

41:08.958 --> 41:10.666
Amen!

41:10.750 --> 41:12.833
I want to talk about forgiveness.

41:14.875 --> 41:15.916
It is hard,

41:17.000 --> 41:18.875
but it's also very important

41:19.958 --> 41:21.208
to learn to forgive.

41:23.250 --> 41:24.875
Forgive those who hurt us.

41:26.208 --> 41:27.958
Those who still hurt us.

41:29.250 --> 41:30.541
But also remember…

41:31.708 --> 41:33.791
that it's vital we forgive ourselves.

41:57.833 --> 41:58.916
On my way here,

42:00.166 --> 42:01.875
I asked God to use me.

42:02.583 --> 42:04.916
To fill me with his endless goodness.

42:05.500 --> 42:09.000
To make of me a new vessel for his wisdom.

42:11.916 --> 42:14.333
I realized one thing is very important.

42:16.208 --> 42:17.208
Family.

42:20.041 --> 42:22.375
Brethren, I want us to reflect

42:22.458 --> 42:25.083
on a passage of the Gospel of Matthew,

42:26.041 --> 42:28.166
chapter 12, verse 46.

42:30.625 --> 42:32.583
"Jesus spoke to the multitudes,

42:32.666 --> 42:35.333
when his mother and brothers
stood outside,

42:36.041 --> 42:37.458
seeking to speak with him."

42:38.000 --> 42:41.375
"One said to him,
'They are standing outside,

42:41.458 --> 42:42.666
seeking to see you.'"

42:44.250 --> 42:45.541
'Who is my mother?'"

42:45.625 --> 42:46.958
"Who are my brothers?"

42:48.041 --> 42:49.625
'"Who are my brothers?'

42:50.500 --> 42:51.541
Jesus replied."

42:53.291 --> 42:55.708
"And he stretched out his hand and said,

42:55.791 --> 42:58.500
'Here are my mother and brothers.'"

43:00.291 --> 43:03.000
"'Whoever does the will of my father

43:03.083 --> 43:07.333
is my brother, my sister, and my mother.'"

43:08.958 --> 43:09.916
Brethren,

43:10.541 --> 43:14.041
Jesus is the son of God,
but this is not his only family.

43:15.541 --> 43:16.625
Family

43:17.375 --> 43:18.666
are those we trust.

43:19.416 --> 43:20.958
Those who grow up with us.

43:22.916 --> 43:24.291
Those by our side,

43:24.875 --> 43:28.375
cheering for us,
for our victory, throughout our struggles.

43:29.666 --> 43:32.250
They're also there for the tribulations,

43:32.333 --> 43:33.708
the hard times.

43:36.333 --> 43:37.500
It's a choice.

43:38.583 --> 43:40.250
To love is a choice.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.791
That's what family is. Thank you.

43:43.875 --> 43:46.541
Thank you, Pastor. In the name of Jesus.

43:46.625 --> 43:48.000
Well done, child!

43:48.083 --> 43:50.500
And we're a big family.

43:50.583 --> 43:51.833
Did I hear an amen?

43:51.916 --> 43:53.916
-Amen!
-Amen!

43:54.000 --> 43:56.375
We are a garden

43:56.458 --> 43:59.875
Before the Lord

43:59.958 --> 44:03.750
A garden irrigated by

44:03.833 --> 44:06.791
Thy grace and thy love

44:07.541 --> 44:10.833
We are Christ's

44:10.916 --> 44:14.541
Sweet perfume

44:14.625 --> 44:21.458
Emanating the smell of life

44:22.250 --> 44:25.750
We are a garden

44:25.833 --> 44:29.041
Before the Lord

44:29.541 --> 44:33.333
A garden irrigated by

44:33.416 --> 44:36.083
Thy grace and thy love

44:37.458 --> 44:40.291
This is KondZilla Fest, guys!

44:40.375 --> 44:41.875
Let me hear you scream!

44:53.375 --> 44:55.916
He showed up at the party all cute

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
Check out his body
Imagine a hot guy

44:59.083 --> 45:01.875
I'm no fool and I'm up to no good

45:01.958 --> 45:04.833
I don't lie to friends
So I told them the truth

45:04.916 --> 45:07.333
Not even a crane

45:07.416 --> 45:10.208
Could pull me off this scumbag's lap

45:10.291 --> 45:13.125
Not even a crane

45:13.208 --> 45:16.000
Could pull me off this scumbag's lap

45:16.083 --> 45:18.250
Not even a crane

45:18.333 --> 45:21.375
Could pull me off this scumbag's lap

45:27.875 --> 45:29.375
Mila's in the house!

45:32.125 --> 45:33.000
STAFF

45:33.083 --> 45:35.000
Bro, the place is packed.

45:35.083 --> 45:36.041
-Really?
-Packed!

45:37.250 --> 45:39.750
That's it. You know what to do.

45:39.833 --> 45:42.041
-Go and kill it, bro.
-You got it.

45:42.125 --> 45:44.333
Marcão, when am I going on stage?

45:44.416 --> 45:46.875
Soon. Keep it cool. I'll let you know.

45:46.958 --> 45:47.791
-Thanks.
-Cool.

45:59.833 --> 46:02.458
Father

46:02.541 --> 46:04.625
I wish we had more time

46:04.708 --> 46:07.791
There were things I wanted to prove

46:07.875 --> 46:10.166
I'd live off my talent

46:10.250 --> 46:14.833
Today, I live off it but still

46:15.416 --> 46:17.666
It's hard to come to terms

46:17.750 --> 46:20.708
With knowing I made it but cannot show you

46:20.791 --> 46:24.625
But I know you're up there watching over

46:24.708 --> 46:28.375
My every step, my every plan

46:28.458 --> 46:32.000
And down here on Earth
I'm taking care of Mom

46:32.083 --> 46:37.000
And I keep on singing
And I keep on dreaming

46:37.083 --> 46:38.500
Dad, I'm right here.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.083
Go do your stuff, Son.

46:41.166 --> 46:45.416
Dad, wherever you are,
know that I made it.

46:46.416 --> 46:48.666
Excuse me, bro. You're up.

46:48.750 --> 46:49.625
Cool.

46:50.125 --> 46:51.416
Vila's star.

46:52.958 --> 46:55.250
Alright, the time has come.

46:55.333 --> 46:58.625
It's the most anticipated moment
of the evening.

46:58.708 --> 47:00.958
Say his name!

47:01.041 --> 47:03.666
Make noise for MC Doni!

47:04.833 --> 47:07.916
MC Doni, coming in hot!

47:08.916 --> 47:12.916
I don't believe in love anymore
I've suffered too much

47:13.000 --> 47:15.625
I saw that love hurts

47:15.708 --> 47:19.083
But I feel in love with that ass
Her moves are insane

47:19.166 --> 47:21.833
She twerks in slow motion

47:21.916 --> 47:25.333
I wonder if I should try my luck

47:25.416 --> 47:27.791
It's too much ass for me to handle

47:27.875 --> 47:31.833
I'm trying to prepare my heart

47:31.916 --> 47:34.500
This time I'm not letting it get attached

47:35.458 --> 47:38.333
She goes down and up with talent

47:38.416 --> 47:41.333
She stares at me, shaking without mercy

47:41.416 --> 47:43.041
She goes down

47:43.125 --> 47:45.875
And up with talent
She stares at me

47:45.958 --> 47:47.708
Shaking without mercy

47:47.791 --> 47:50.416
Shake it, shake it

47:51.208 --> 47:54.125
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

47:54.208 --> 47:57.125
Shake it, shake it

47:57.208 --> 48:00.708
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

48:02.375 --> 48:03.958
This is how we roll.

48:04.041 --> 48:07.166
Over 30 million YouTube views,
top 50 on Spotify.

48:07.250 --> 48:08.541
Come on!

48:09.875 --> 48:13.458
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

48:15.833 --> 48:18.125
I don't believe in love anymore

48:18.208 --> 48:22.208
I've suffered too much
I saw that love hurts

48:22.291 --> 48:24.333
But I feel in love with that ass

48:24.416 --> 48:28.458
Her moves are insane
She twerks in slow motion

48:28.541 --> 48:32.250
I wonder if I should try my luck

48:32.333 --> 48:34.708
It's too much ass for me to handle

48:34.791 --> 48:38.791
I'm trying to prepare my heart

48:38.875 --> 48:41.625
This time I'm not letting it get attached

48:42.208 --> 48:45.250
She goes down and up with talent

48:45.333 --> 48:48.583
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

48:48.666 --> 48:51.458
She goes down and up with talent

48:51.541 --> 48:54.416
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

48:54.500 --> 48:57.708
Shake it, shake it

48:57.791 --> 49:01.000
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

49:01.083 --> 49:03.833
Shake it, shake it

49:03.916 --> 49:07.500
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

49:14.458 --> 49:15.333
Thank you.

49:15.916 --> 49:17.208
Come on!

49:17.291 --> 49:20.541
She keeps staring at me
Shaking without mercy

49:20.625 --> 49:21.833
Thank you!

49:35.500 --> 49:38.375
What's up, boys? Have a good one.

49:42.708 --> 49:44.583
Hey, Nando. All good?

49:44.666 --> 49:46.458
Hey, Badá. All good, bro.

49:47.625 --> 49:51.375
I called to tell you
that I worked it out with your guy.

49:51.875 --> 49:54.250
We changed warehouses to be safe.

49:54.333 --> 49:56.583
Tomorrow, all shops will be stocked.

49:56.666 --> 49:58.916
Well done, man.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.291
We gotta catch the rats.
Our asses are on the line now.

50:02.375 --> 50:05.458
I got this, bro.
It's my only mission from now on.

50:05.541 --> 50:08.000
Good shit, homie. Well done.

50:08.083 --> 50:10.416
You're the only boss in Vila Áurea now.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.458
Hear me?

50:11.541 --> 50:15.125
It's with you now, bro.
Talk to you later. Peace out.

50:15.208 --> 50:18.125
Alright, brother. Call me if you need me.

50:24.958 --> 50:26.166
What's good, guys?

50:27.083 --> 50:29.625
Hey, bro. Where are you going?

50:29.708 --> 50:32.500
Bro, why are you messing with the boy?

50:33.000 --> 50:34.083
Leave him alone.

50:35.708 --> 50:36.541
Come here.

50:37.041 --> 50:38.208
Hang out with us.

50:41.250 --> 50:43.250
-All good?
-Cool.

50:49.333 --> 50:52.958
Here, kid. Get five takeouts
from the lady's joint.

50:53.041 --> 50:54.000
Okay.

50:56.958 --> 50:57.916
One for you too.

51:06.125 --> 51:09.541
What the hell? Don't bother the kid.

51:09.625 --> 51:11.416
The kid's an orphan.

51:11.916 --> 51:13.291
He's got vision, man.

51:13.375 --> 51:16.125
He could become the boss.

55:10.416 --> 55:14.333
