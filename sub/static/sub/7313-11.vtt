10:44.869 --> 10:48.043
spreading ill-will and yuletide
yuckness.

10:48.086 --> 10:50.608
Hey, did he try to pick
a fight with you in
the squad room?

10:50.652 --> 10:54.043
No, he's just being a...Unseasonably and
unreasonably rude.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.478
He's being a father-in-law
to be.

10:56.521 --> 10:58.173
Well, if he knows
what's good for him,

10:58.217 --> 11:00.608
he's not going to come
a-wassailing within

11:00.652 --> 11:03.826
at least 20 feet
of my leaves of green.

11:03.869 --> 11:05.521
What do we got?

11:05.565 --> 11:08.130
Mall security footage
courtesy of McGee

11:08.173 --> 11:10.913
and the kind people at the
Carroll County Outlet Shoppes.

11:10.956 --> 11:13.130
"The Jewel of Carroll County."

11:13.173 --> 11:16.478
I don't think there's a lot
to do in Carroll County...

11:16.521 --> 11:18.565
Did you find our female caller?

11:18.608 --> 11:20.652
I'm granting you your first
Christmas wish, Gibbs.

11:20.695 --> 11:24.000
That is her, calling the hotel.

11:24.043 --> 11:27.043
If the blood on the rag
that Ducky found is hers,

11:27.086 --> 11:29.478
she doesn't appear wounded.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.608
Get an I.D.?

11:31.652 --> 11:34.434
No, but I think
I know where she is.

11:34.478 --> 11:36.739
Watch when she turns
towards the camera.

11:36.782 --> 11:41.347
"If you are who
you say, you will
figure it out."

11:44.434 --> 11:47.956
The bag?Yeah. It's from
a women's clothing store.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
She knew that we would watch
the security footage.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.000
She wants you to come
find her, Gibbs.

11:52.043 --> 11:53.956
Nice work.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.608
Tell DiNozzo to have
local P.D. meet us there.

12:00.695 --> 12:02.913
♪

12:05.739 --> 12:07.391
Welcome to Carroll County.

12:07.434 --> 12:08.869
You must be NCIS.

12:08.913 --> 12:10.869
Snow's really coming
down out there, huh?

12:10.913 --> 12:15.826
So they, uh... sent
a mall cop, huh?

12:15.869 --> 12:18.260
No, sir. I'm a county deputy.
Officer Billy McCormick.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.043
I was the only one
on duty when you called.

12:21.086 --> 12:23.000
You got an update, Deputy?Yes, sir.

12:23.043 --> 12:26.391
I canvassed the store,
but haven't found
anyone in distress.

12:26.434 --> 12:28.739
Whoever you're looking for
must have left already.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.739
How hard did you look?I talked to every single
solitary person.

12:31.782 --> 12:33.086
What about in
the dressing rooms?

12:33.130 --> 12:37.086
Well, no. This is
a women's clothing store, so...

12:37.130 --> 12:38.913
TONY:
Yeah, yeah.

12:38.956 --> 12:41.043
We-we are looking for
a woman, though.

12:41.086 --> 12:43.304
Get everybody out of here.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.782
Will do, boss.

12:44.826 --> 12:47.043
Good job, though.
Good job.

12:47.086 --> 12:50.347
TONY: Can I have
your attention, please.

12:50.391 --> 12:52.391
Everyone needs to leave
the store immediately.

12:52.434 --> 12:55.434
Exit's this way, please.

13:02.739 --> 13:05.434
Federal agents.
Go on, get out of here.Okay.

13:15.652 --> 13:17.043
[rattling]

13:32.217 --> 13:34.173
NCIS.

13:34.217 --> 13:36.956
Yeah, I've seen
fake credentials before.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.695
Hand over
your weapons.

13:38.739 --> 13:41.173
There's only one way
to get a Marine's weapon.

13:41.217 --> 13:44.347
What do you know about it?
You a leatherneck?

13:44.391 --> 13:45.913
Where do you think
I got this haircut?

13:54.043 --> 13:56.391
Well, if you two aren't the ones
that killed Jake,

13:56.434 --> 13:57.956
that means that
they're still out there.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.913
You think they're
after you, too?I know they are.

13:59.956 --> 14:02.521
Jake wasn't
the target-- I am.

14:09.043 --> 14:10.913
GIBBS:
Did my I.T.S. at Camp Lejeune.

14:10.956 --> 14:14.000
You like it there,
Lieutenant Reynolds?Call me Emma.

14:14.043 --> 14:15.652
And yes, I did.

14:15.695 --> 14:18.043
Wish like hell
I was there now.

14:18.086 --> 14:19.260
Weather's getting
pretty bad, boss.

14:19.304 --> 14:20.956
Tractor trailer jackknifed
on the highway.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.869
It's bumper to bumper.You out getting
coffee, DiNozzo?

14:23.913 --> 14:25.652
No, no, no, this
is hot chocolate

14:25.695 --> 14:27.173
for the preg...
the Lieutenant.

14:27.217 --> 14:30.260
Listen, everyone, I don't
want any special treatment.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.782
I'm a Marine first
and pregnant second.

14:32.826 --> 14:34.086
Oo-rah.

14:34.130 --> 14:35.913
Oo-right.

14:35.956 --> 14:38.260
ZIVA: Well, I will gladly
take the special treatment.

14:38.304 --> 14:41.521
I like mine with
extra marshmallows--
the little tiny ones, please.

14:41.565 --> 14:44.608
Who do you think
I am, your elf?

14:44.652 --> 14:46.608
Actually, I'll take one
with marshmallows, too.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.739
Thought you said you didn't
want any special...

14:50.173 --> 14:52.086
Extra marshmallows coming up.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.000
So who is after you, Lieutenant?

14:55.043 --> 14:56.478
I don't know.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.217
Only ever been
a squared-away Marine

14:58.260 --> 14:59.652
until
eight and a half months ago.

14:59.695 --> 15:02.043
I was stationed
outside Kabul.

15:02.086 --> 15:05.043
Our unit was training
local Afghan soldiers.

15:05.086 --> 15:07.347
One of them spoke English.

15:07.391 --> 15:09.043
His name was Amir.

15:09.086 --> 15:11.434
Things got romantic.

15:11.478 --> 15:15.130
At least what passes for
romantic in that hellhole.

15:15.173 --> 15:17.913
Sand can get in some
pretty inconvenient places.

15:17.956 --> 15:21.130
Any disciplinary action?I took responsibility.

15:21.173 --> 15:23.391
C.O. made me forfeit
two months pay

15:23.434 --> 15:24.913
and sent me stateside.

15:24.956 --> 15:26.391
Thought that was it.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.173
But?

15:28.217 --> 15:33.130
Last week, I noticed I was being
followed by a black SUV.

15:33.173 --> 15:35.695
I would shake it, and then
another one would show up.

15:35.739 --> 15:37.130
Multiple people
were following you?

15:37.173 --> 15:39.130
Three men--
separate SUV's.

15:39.173 --> 15:40.652
I got one
of the license numbers.

15:40.695 --> 15:43.304
It was registered
to the Department of Defense.

15:43.347 --> 15:47.608
Call McGee.
Have him follow up.Mm-hmm.

15:51.304 --> 15:53.173
So you skipped town
with Marsden?

15:53.217 --> 15:55.130
Jake's an old friend.

15:55.173 --> 15:58.043
He offered to drive me to my
parents' place in Ohio.

15:58.086 --> 16:00.391
That's when things
got crazy.

16:00.434 --> 16:01.739
They followed you.

16:01.782 --> 16:03.565
They tried to run us
off the road.

16:03.608 --> 16:05.347
I cut my hand
when the window broke.

16:05.391 --> 16:06.739
And we lost them.

16:06.782 --> 16:09.217
But I started feeling woozy,
so we went to the hotel.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.478
When Jake didn't come
down, I knew that I had
to get out of there.

16:12.521 --> 16:15.130
Why didn't you
call the police?

16:15.173 --> 16:19.869
If these guys were government,
they would send local LEOs
looking for us, too.

16:19.913 --> 16:23.130
I don't know what this is about
or how far up this goes.

16:23.173 --> 16:25.913
Well, you can trust us.

16:27.826 --> 16:30.043
Thank you.

16:30.086 --> 16:33.478
Where's the father now?

16:33.521 --> 16:35.695
McGEE:
The baby's father's dead?

16:35.739 --> 16:39.521
Yes. Amir Mayat died in an IED
explosion back in May.

16:39.565 --> 16:43.217
Says here, Lieutenant Reynolds
went on leave

16:43.260 --> 16:44.565
after the incident.

16:44.608 --> 16:46.043
What about the in-laws?

16:46.086 --> 16:48.043
I mean, they must have
some interest in the child.

16:48.086 --> 16:50.000
According to her statement,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.347
she and Amir kept the pregnancy
a secret from his family.

16:52.391 --> 16:55.260
You know, Agent McGee, all of
this is in her personnel file.

16:55.304 --> 16:57.130
You don't need me
to read it to you.

16:57.173 --> 16:58.173
Hang on.

17:03.826 --> 17:06.043
What is it you
really want to know?

17:06.086 --> 17:10.217
Is that file the only record
DOD has on Lieutenant Reynolds?

17:10.260 --> 17:12.608
What do you mean?Someone's having her followed.

17:12.652 --> 17:16.043
You think it's us?
We're DOD, not CIA.

17:16.086 --> 17:18.173
We don't usually
do that kind of thing.

17:18.217 --> 17:19.304
Usually.

17:19.347 --> 17:20.956
Why would we care
what Reynolds does

17:21.000 --> 17:22.260
on her maternity leave?

17:22.304 --> 17:24.000
We have reason to believe
that three gunmen

17:24.043 --> 17:26.260
using vehicles registered
to the DOD

17:26.304 --> 17:29.478
murdered a Navy captain and are
now after the Lieutenant.

17:29.521 --> 17:31.217
What are you suggesting?

17:31.260 --> 17:33.869
Do you know how many vehicles
we have registered in this city?

17:33.913 --> 17:36.173
Thousands. They get stolen
all the time.

17:36.217 --> 17:38.695
I'd be happy to check
our database for you.

17:38.739 --> 17:40.217
I understand that, sir,

17:40.260 --> 17:41.521
but you're not answering
my question.

17:41.565 --> 17:43.695
Is Lieutenant Reynolds
on your radar?

17:43.739 --> 17:46.043
Agent McGee, the only thing
on my radar right now

17:46.086 --> 17:47.260
is Santa Claus.

17:47.304 --> 17:50.260
I understand, sir.
But you will let us know

17:50.304 --> 17:52.826
if you find out anything
on Lieutenant Reynolds?

17:52.869 --> 17:57.043
Even if I did, I couldn't tell
you without authorization.

17:57.086 --> 17:59.086
Feliz Navidad.

18:03.521 --> 18:06.086
Yeah, Abbs.Gibbs, what are you
still doing there?

18:06.130 --> 18:09.173
The snow is falling faster
than my holiday spirit.

18:09.217 --> 18:12.086
There's a pregnant Marine
being hunted on Christmas.

18:12.130 --> 18:13.260
Heaven and nature
are not singing.

18:13.304 --> 18:14.565
Well, I'm waiting on intel

18:14.608 --> 18:15.913
and an escort
from state troopers.

18:15.956 --> 18:17.217
Just tell me what you got.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.130
Background on Lieutenant
Reynolds' baby daddy--

18:19.173 --> 18:22.260
Amir Mayat--
and he is not a poor farmer.

18:22.304 --> 18:26.173
The Mayat tribe controls a
massive and critical land parcel

18:26.217 --> 18:28.260
just outside of Kabul.Family's wealthy.

18:28.304 --> 18:29.521
Extremely. And Amir

18:29.565 --> 18:31.173
was the sole male heir.

18:31.217 --> 18:33.000
Until he was killed.

18:33.043 --> 18:36.913
Yes. And if Emma has
a boy, then...The kid inherits everything.

18:36.956 --> 18:38.043
Practically royalty.

18:38.086 --> 18:39.913
At least extremely valuable.

18:39.956 --> 18:42.173
Well, that explains why the
Lieutenant's still alive.

18:42.217 --> 18:43.869
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They don't want her dead.

18:43.913 --> 18:45.260
They want the baby alive.

18:45.304 --> 18:47.260
It does not explain
DOD's involvement.

18:47.304 --> 18:48.565
McGEE:
This might, boss.

18:48.608 --> 18:51.347
What, McGee?I did some digging.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.260
I tunneled under the DOD
firewall.

18:53.304 --> 18:56.000
Turns out U.S. military forces
in Afghanistan

18:56.043 --> 18:59.347
are trying to build a trade
highway through Mayat land.

18:59.391 --> 19:01.391
It's vital
for fighting insurgents

19:01.434 --> 19:03.173
and stopping weapons shipments.

19:03.217 --> 19:06.086
ABBY:
And the tribal elders
aren't cooperating.

19:06.130 --> 19:08.173
Which is costing the DOD
millions of dollars.

19:08.217 --> 19:10.608
And if the project goes under,
they lose even more.

19:10.652 --> 19:12.217
Well, they need
a bargaining chip.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.608
The little baby heir.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.695
By birthright, he'll be
the head of the Mayat tribe.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.652
They have the kid,
they have the land.

19:17.695 --> 19:19.086
Can we prove it?

19:19.130 --> 19:21.043
Well, I still can't find
anything concrete

19:21.086 --> 19:23.000
connecting the DOD
and our three kings.

19:23.043 --> 19:24.217
Keep looking.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.565
[knocking]

19:37.043 --> 19:38.608
How long have they
been back there?

19:40.739 --> 19:42.391
Not long enough.

19:42.434 --> 19:44.913
Door.

19:44.956 --> 19:46.695
I can't hear a
word they're saying.

19:46.739 --> 19:49.043
Well, if you hadn't made that
remark about her tattoos,

19:49.086 --> 19:50.478
we wouldn't be in time out.

19:51.782 --> 19:53.434
I still got six minutes left.

19:56.913 --> 19:59.130
You do know that there are jobs
in the private sector

19:59.173 --> 20:01.565
where you could
make twice as much money

20:01.608 --> 20:04.086
and still be home
by 6:00, right?

20:04.130 --> 20:06.173
Hadn't really thought
about that.

20:06.217 --> 20:09.130
Well, maybe you should start.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.913
And all I said to her

20:14.956 --> 20:18.652
was that girls with tattoos
are easy. Everyone knows that.

20:20.956 --> 20:22.347
Is something
wrong, Agent Gibbs?

20:22.391 --> 20:24.478
What did you find out?I'll tell you on the way out.

20:24.521 --> 20:26.391
Car's out back, boss.
They started closing
the highways.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.043
It's not going to open
till the morning.

20:28.086 --> 20:29.391
Looks like we're
on our own.

20:29.434 --> 20:31.217
Back roads? What if
someone follows us?

20:31.260 --> 20:33.086
Can't wait any longer.I want a weapon.

20:33.130 --> 20:34.826
You don't need one.
You got us.

20:34.869 --> 20:37.565
Don't patronize me.
I was the top shot
in my platoon.

20:37.608 --> 20:40.043
You think Deputy Dog's
ever seen actual combat?

20:40.086 --> 20:42.782
I did three tours.Where is Barney Fife anyway?

20:42.826 --> 20:44.739
I thought he was
out back with you.

20:56.478 --> 20:58.217
I'm sorry.

20:58.260 --> 20:59.347
MAN:
Shut up!

20:59.391 --> 21:01.130
He came out of nowhere.Shut up!

21:01.173 --> 21:02.260
He's one of the three.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.565
NCIS. Let him go.

21:03.608 --> 21:04.782
Give me the woman!

21:04.826 --> 21:06.521
No, it's not going to happen.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.391
I don't want to hurt him.GIBBS: I know exactly
what you want.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.652
Drop your weapon.

21:10.695 --> 21:13.043
MAN: You are in no position
to make demands.

21:13.086 --> 21:15.347
I'm not, but she is.

21:15.391 --> 21:17.043
[gun cocking]

21:17.086 --> 21:19.086
Unless you want to die
today, put it down.

21:21.304 --> 21:23.130
Now!

21:25.173 --> 21:26.652
DiNozzo, you and the deputy
take him back.

21:26.695 --> 21:28.086
We got the Lieutenant.

21:28.130 --> 21:29.782
TONY:
All right, meet you back
at the Navy yard.

21:29.826 --> 21:31.434
On it, boss.

21:35.347 --> 21:37.304
What's that all about?

21:37.347 --> 21:38.739
Hedge trimmer accident?

21:38.782 --> 21:41.391
Proof.
Of what?

21:41.434 --> 21:43.043
Nerve.

21:43.086 --> 21:45.782
Initiation ritual common
in Russian prison gangs.

21:45.826 --> 21:48.652
Any of your other friends
missing fingers?

21:48.695 --> 21:50.478
You will see for yourself.

21:50.521 --> 21:53.869
What does that mean?Means we're getting the hell
out of here.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.652
Watch your head.

22:00.565 --> 22:02.565
[wind whistling]

22:04.217 --> 22:05.000
[phone ringing nearby]

22:05.043 --> 22:06.652
Ah, there you are.

22:06.695 --> 22:10.217
I hear the team is on its
way back with a suspect.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.391
Have you heard
anything more?

22:12.434 --> 22:13.652
No.

22:13.695 --> 22:15.652
Just been waiting on Ed.

22:19.217 --> 22:20.869
What's the matter, Mr. Palmer?

22:22.478 --> 22:24.652
Just a bit
overwhelmed,
I guess.

22:27.304 --> 22:30.347
My own father was only
ever encouraging to me

22:30.391 --> 22:31.434
no matter what I did.

22:31.478 --> 22:33.913
And Ed, Ed is like

22:33.956 --> 22:36.304
Ebenezer Scrooge at the
beginning of the book.

22:36.347 --> 22:38.043
A bit of advice.

22:38.086 --> 22:42.826
Don't let the disparaging
remarks of a myopic individual

22:42.869 --> 22:44.478
influence your life.

22:44.521 --> 22:45.782
See, that's just it.

22:45.826 --> 22:47.434
He finally said
something nice to me.

22:47.478 --> 22:48.434
Really?

22:48.478 --> 22:50.304
He offered me a job

22:50.347 --> 22:51.782
at his funeral home.

22:51.826 --> 22:55.608
He said that Breena and I
could work together.

22:55.652 --> 22:57.391
Eventually take
over the business.

22:57.434 --> 22:59.869
Really?

22:59.913 --> 23:02.043
Is that what you want?

23:02.086 --> 23:03.652
Me? No.

23:03.695 --> 23:04.956
No, I love NCIS.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.478
But I want to
make Breena happy.

23:07.521 --> 23:11.782
Doctor... what if this
is the only way?

23:11.826 --> 23:17.347
Breena will be happy
if you are happy.

23:19.043 --> 23:21.565
Tell that to Mister Ed.

23:26.130 --> 23:28.130
[car engine revving]

23:31.217 --> 23:33.826
Russian mercenaries want
to take my unborn child

23:33.869 --> 23:36.652
because he's the only heir
to land in Afghanistan?

23:36.695 --> 23:38.826
We believe the gunmen may
have been hired by someone

23:38.869 --> 23:40.043
inside the government.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.217
Why?

23:41.260 --> 23:43.086
Because that land
may be key

23:43.130 --> 23:45.347
in winning
or losing Afghanistan.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.434
[sighing]:
I'm starting to understand

23:47.478 --> 23:50.652
why Amir distanced himself
from his family.

23:50.695 --> 23:52.043
[loud bang]

23:52.086 --> 23:53.478
What happened?

23:53.521 --> 23:56.521
[engine sputtering]Is it the engine?

23:56.565 --> 23:58.043
The Russians.

24:00.826 --> 24:03.521
There is no signal out here.

24:03.565 --> 24:06.652
There's a light up ahead.

24:11.478 --> 24:13.478
[engine sputtering]

24:19.043 --> 24:20.695
[hissing]

24:32.130 --> 24:33.565
Oh, God.

24:36.260 --> 24:37.956
Ugh!

24:38.000 --> 24:40.347
Do you think we can fix it?

24:40.391 --> 24:42.652
I don't think
we've got a choice.

24:42.695 --> 24:44.478
I saw a garage around back.

24:44.521 --> 24:45.521
I'll help push.

24:51.695 --> 24:53.130
Don't push.

[papers rustling]

25:04.304 --> 25:06.260
You guys are
still here, huh?

25:06.304 --> 25:07.739
Huh. Well, I'm Ed's ride,

25:07.782 --> 25:09.434
and technically
I'm still on duty, so...

25:09.478 --> 25:11.173
Duty.

25:12.739 --> 25:13.782
TONY:
Hey.

25:13.826 --> 25:15.347
Any word from Gibbs?

25:15.391 --> 25:18.043
Not yet. What do you think's
taking them so long?

25:18.086 --> 25:19.695
I don't know.
We left separately.

25:19.739 --> 25:21.217
Must have taken
a different route.

25:21.260 --> 25:23.652
Could have hit bad weather.
Did you try calling him?

25:23.695 --> 25:25.521
Abby's been calling his
cell every five minutes.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.608
Nothing. And the land
lines are down from here
to Baltimore due to ice.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.304
Lucky we still
have Internet.

25:30.347 --> 25:32.130
Find anything to finger
our fingerless man?

25:32.173 --> 25:34.173
I ran his remaining prints.

25:34.217 --> 25:36.434
Name is Veli Tupolev.

No record in the States

25:37.652 --> 25:39.521
but Interpol's
a different story.

25:39.565 --> 25:40.913
Let me guess--
a trained mercenary

25:40.956 --> 25:42.913
who's used to hard
Russian winters

25:42.956 --> 25:44.652
and even harder
Russian prisons?

25:44.695 --> 25:47.130
Pretty much. How do you
want to break him?

25:47.173 --> 25:48.913
Well...

25:48.956 --> 25:51.086
[crunching]

25:57.000 --> 25:59.565
What? I was hungry.

25:59.608 --> 26:00.826
Didn't know I'd be held hostage.

[chuckles]

26:03.086 --> 26:04.173
Wait a second.

26:05.956 --> 26:08.869
Are those Hollander's homemade
Christmas cookies from HR?

26:08.913 --> 26:10.565
Did she make molasses this year?

26:10.608 --> 26:14.086
She did, and they were good.

26:14.130 --> 26:16.347
We're gonna need
to commandeer these.

26:16.391 --> 26:17.608
Police business.

26:17.652 --> 26:19.652
I think I have a way
to break our Bad Santa.

26:19.695 --> 26:21.652
With what, cookies?

26:21.695 --> 26:23.652
What are you gonna do,
sugarboard him?

26:23.695 --> 26:26.434
Thought you said
they were pros.

and caught fire.

Yeah, I'm gonna have to try
and redo some wiring.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.478
I'll see what they got.

26:47.521 --> 26:49.304
Mm-hmm.

The phones are still out,
but I'll keep checking.

26:53.608 --> 26:55.521
Or if you want
any help in there,

26:55.565 --> 26:57.434
I know my way
around a car.

26:57.478 --> 26:58.478
Well, sit down. Rest.

26:58.521 --> 27:00.391
Have some fluids.

27:00.434 --> 27:02.043
No. I already did.

27:02.086 --> 27:04.086
I-I left a couple of bucks
on the register.

27:04.130 --> 27:06.043
Felt weird just to take it.

[wind whistling]

27:10.521 --> 27:13.478
GIBBS:
Hey.

27:13.521 --> 27:15.173
Don't worry about it;
it's gonna be fine.

27:15.217 --> 27:17.304
This is not exactly
the Christmas Eve

27:17.347 --> 27:19.304
that I had planned on,
Agent Gibbs.

27:19.347 --> 27:24.043
Actually, I hadn't
planned on any of this.

27:24.086 --> 27:28.217
Amir... the baby... people
trying to steal him.

27:28.260 --> 27:29.608
Him?

27:29.652 --> 27:31.521
I thought you said
you didn't know.

27:31.565 --> 27:34.086
I don't, but I can tell.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.869
[laughs]

27:35.913 --> 27:37.869
Oh, and judging by the way

27:37.913 --> 27:39.478
he's punching
and kicking me right now...

27:39.521 --> 27:41.826
Come on....I think he's gonna
be a Marine, too.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.826
Sit down.
Whew.

27:46.043 --> 27:48.565
I just wanted to be a Marine.

27:52.173 --> 27:54.130
I guess someone else
had other plans.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.956
Yeah. Wouldn't
be the first time.

27:58.434 --> 28:00.391
Do you have kids,
Agent Gibbs?

28:00.434 --> 28:02.130
Had a daughter.

28:02.173 --> 28:04.956
Were you there
when she was born?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.173
Deployed.

28:09.217 --> 28:12.565
Well, I guess I kind of have
to be there for mine.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.652
Not that I'm complaining.

28:14.695 --> 28:16.956
It's just... I might be...

28:17.000 --> 28:19.521
Scared?

28:19.565 --> 28:21.739
The hell you say?

28:21.782 --> 28:23.565
It's all right if you are.

28:23.608 --> 28:25.043
Not according to the Corps.

28:25.086 --> 28:27.782
That's what I like
about being a Marine.

28:27.826 --> 28:29.565
The procedures.
The code.

28:29.608 --> 28:33.217
I like having a measurable
set of expectations.

28:33.260 --> 28:36.956
I could always tell how good
I was doing, but with this...

28:37.000 --> 28:39.217
how do I know?

28:39.260 --> 28:41.565
You don't.

28:41.608 --> 28:44.956
But you'll be able to tell.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.652
Mm.

28:47.695 --> 28:50.043
Right now, I think
this guy is telling me

28:50.086 --> 28:52.086
that it's time to eat.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.521
Well...

28:53.565 --> 28:56.565
in that case...

28:58.086 --> 28:59.000
Mmm!

28:59.043 --> 29:00.260
This one's on me.

29:00.304 --> 29:01.304

You know, Wendy used to make
the most kick-ass snickerdoodle.

29:14.869 --> 29:19.000
I'm going to start with a series
of true or false statements

29:19.043 --> 29:21.086
Mm-hmm.to give us a baseline.

29:21.130 --> 29:22.826
What are you talking about?

29:22.869 --> 29:24.000
Just think of it as like
a lie detector test

29:24.043 --> 29:25.043
with cookies.

29:25.086 --> 29:26.521
You just have to
sit there and eat.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.695
Okay, here we go.

Your hair is purple.

[crunching]

29:37.130 --> 29:39.130
You have all your fingers.

29:41.739 --> 29:44.739
You were following
Lieutenant Emma Reynolds

29:44.782 --> 29:46.869
with the intention
of abducting her baby.

29:49.913 --> 29:50.913
Oh, hesitation.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.304
I see the
hesitation.

29:52.347 --> 29:53.521
Yeah, he did.
Yeah.

29:53.565 --> 29:55.347
Confirming hesitation.

29:55.391 --> 29:57.130
No, no, I did not hesitate.

29:57.173 --> 29:58.565
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:58.608 --> 30:00.391
You sure about that?

30:03.173 --> 30:05.434
You've never
committed a crime.

30:07.782 --> 30:10.782
Your favorite
color is pink.

30:10.826 --> 30:12.130
You were hired by someone

30:12.173 --> 30:14.347
at the United States Department
of Defense.

30:17.217 --> 30:18.913
[laughing]

30:20.173 --> 30:23.391
So you really are working
for the government!

30:23.434 --> 30:26.478
No. I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:26.521 --> 30:28.869
Sure about that?

30:28.913 --> 30:32.130
So then you must be working for
the Mayat tribe in Afghanistan.

30:35.173 --> 30:37.130

30:37.173 --> 30:39.043
I'll take that as a yes.

30:39.086 --> 30:41.043
No. [coughs]
I just choke on cookie.

30:41.086 --> 30:42.956
It does not
mean anything.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.391
Oh, it speaks volumes.

30:44.434 --> 30:47.043
This is stupid!

30:47.086 --> 30:49.434
You're just trying to mess
with my head!

30:49.478 --> 30:52.913
Then why are you getting
so upset if it isn't true?

30:52.956 --> 30:55.260
If the family hired you,

30:55.304 --> 30:57.695
then they must have
found out about the baby.

30:57.739 --> 31:00.000
They need an heir
to keep their land.

31:03.826 --> 31:05.695
Not the frosted cutouts.

31:08.913 --> 31:10.956
I will stop eating cookies.

31:12.391 --> 31:14.956
Your prepaid cell
we found on you.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.304
How are you communicating
with your other two associates?

31:17.347 --> 31:21.260
The only number stored
on your contacts list
is six numbers long.

31:21.304 --> 31:23.652
You're always missing a couple
of digits, aren't you?

31:23.695 --> 31:25.217
[chuckling]

31:25.260 --> 31:26.869
Well, maybe that's
not a mistake.

31:26.913 --> 31:28.391
Maybe it's something else.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.391
Coordinates?

31:31.434 --> 31:32.913
Code? Password?

31:32.956 --> 31:36.130
Radio frequency?

31:36.173 --> 31:37.869
Radio frequency.

31:38.869 --> 31:41.000
[smashing phone]

31:42.782 --> 31:43.913
I'm gonna go
with radio frequency.

31:45.434 --> 31:47.478
You will never get it now.

31:47.521 --> 31:49.521
We wrote it down, genius.

31:49.565 --> 31:50.956
If they're using
radio systems,

31:51.000 --> 31:52.913
we should be able to
pick up some chatter.
