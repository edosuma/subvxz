WEBVTT

00:05.373 --> 00:08.676
OKAY, WELL...

00:08.709 --> 00:11.212
I DID NOT GET THE JOB
IN NEW YORK.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.613
BUT I GOT THE REAL PRIZE--

00:12.646 --> 00:15.416
DOMESTIC BLISS.

00:15.449 --> 00:18.719
JAN MADE ME BREAKFAST
THIS MORNING.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.689
WELL, SHE BOUGHT THE MILK.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.258
IT'S SOY.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.694
THIS IS WHY I DO IT.

00:26.727 --> 00:30.598
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE
TO COME HOME TO.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.501
[sighs]

00:33.534 --> 00:36.570
SHE PROBABLY WON'T BE UP
FOR A FEW HOURS.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.506
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A VERY GOOD YEAR.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.641
VERY GOOD.

00:40.674 --> 00:41.775
JAN IS AT HOME.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.411
JIM IS BACK.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.080
MY PROTéGé RYAN
IS AT CORPORATE.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.249
GOOD STUFF.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.552
ANDY AND DWIGHT ARE ROCKING
THE SALES TEAM.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.553
I FEEL VERY BLESSED.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.322
D'OH!
[tires screeching]

00:59.893 --> 01:04.232
[cheerful music]

01:04.265 --> 01:11.372
*

01:34.762 --> 01:36.464
YOU KNOW, GENERALLY
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA

01:36.497 --> 01:37.831
TO CLICK
ON ANY INTERNET OFFERS

01:37.865 --> 01:39.433
THAT YOU
HAVEN'T REQUESTED.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.169
WHAT WAS THE EXACT
OFFER?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.437
IT WAS FOR A...VIDEO.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.473
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT KIND OF VIDEO?

01:45.506 --> 01:49.677
A CELEBRITY SEX TAPE.

01:49.710 --> 01:50.678
REALLY?

01:50.711 --> 01:51.845
WHAT KIND OF
CELEBRITY?

01:51.879 --> 01:52.846
NOT RELEVANT.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.747
HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR IT?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.516
NOT RELEVANT.
YOU PA FOR IT?

01:55.549 --> 01:57.451
IT ALL HAPPENED
SO FAST.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.454
I BROKE UP WITH KAREN
AFTER THE JOB INTERVIEW.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.190
AND, UH...

02:02.223 --> 02:03.857
IT WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD

02:03.891 --> 02:05.426
WHEN SHE CAME BACK
FROM THE CITY.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.195
SHE TOLD ME VERY CLEARLY

02:07.228 --> 02:08.396
THAT JUST BECAUSE
WE WERE BROKEN UP

02:08.429 --> 02:09.897
DIDN'T MEAN
THAT SHE WAS GOING ANYWHERE,

02:09.930 --> 02:12.866
BECAUSE SHE HAD WORKED
REALLY HARD FOR HER CAREER.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.869
BUT THE NEXT DAY,
HER DESK WAS EMPTY.

02:15.903 --> 02:20.508
AND AS FOR ME AND MY CURRENT
ROMANTIC LIFE...

02:20.541 --> 02:21.842
I, UH...

02:21.875 --> 02:24.578
I'M SINGLE NOW
AND LOOKING.

02:24.612 --> 02:27.348
SO IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY...

02:27.381 --> 02:28.949
JIM AND I WENT TO DINNER
A FEW TIMES

02:28.982 --> 02:30.818
WHEN HE GOT BACK
FROM NEW YORK.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.754
I TALKED HIM THROUGH
HIS BREAKUP.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.957
IT'S REALLY NICE
TO BE GOOD FRIENDS AGAIN.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.193
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:39.227 --> 02:42.363
PAM AND JIM
ARE TOTALLY HOOKING UP.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.931
ALL THEY DO IS SMILE.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.899
THEY'RE JUST KEEPING IT
A SECRET.

02:45.933 --> 02:46.900
RIGHT?

02:46.934 --> 02:47.901
I DON'T KNOW.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.238
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
OF INTIMACY.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.373
THEY'VE BEEN IN REMARKABLY
GOOD MOODS.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.374
COULD BE OTHER THINGS.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.776
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:55.809 --> 02:56.977
AND SUNDAY,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.480
I'M THINKING OF GOING TO THAT
FLEA MARKET AT THE DRIVE-IN.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.848
OH, THAT SOUNDS FUN.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.683
I'M MOUNTAIN BIKING
ON SUNDAY IN, UH...

03:02.716 --> 03:03.917
MONTAGE MOUNTAIN.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.286
(Pam)
COOL.
YEAH.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.820
WELL, HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.864
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.733
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.269
MEREDITH WAS HIT
BY A CAR.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.836
WHAT?
WHERE?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.872
IT HAPPENED THIS MORNING
IN THE PARKING LOT.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.674
I TOOK HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.777
AND THE DOCTORS TRIED
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.779
THEY DID THE BEST
THAT THEY COULD.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.882
AND SHE IS GOING
TO BE OKAY.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.351
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.387
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO PHRASE IT
LIKE THAT?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.721
SO SHE'S REALLY
GOING TO BE FINE?

03:40.754 --> 03:41.722
YES.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.957
SHE HAS A SLIGHT...

03:43.991 --> 03:45.593
PELVICAL FRACTURE.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.696
BUT, UH, PEOPLE HAVE SURVIVED
FAR WORSE.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.864
THANK GOD YOU WERE THERE.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.334
YEAH.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.535
DID YOU SEE
WHO DID IT?

03:54.568 --> 03:55.436
(Dwight)
OH, NO NEED.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.671
WE CAN JUST CHECK
THE SECURITY TAPES.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.539
YEAH, KIND OF
A GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS THERE.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.342
I WAS ABLE TO BE
ON THE SCENE SO QUICKLY,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.877
BECAUSE I WAS IN THE CAR
THAT HIT HER.

04:06.614 --> 04:07.648
WHO WAS DRIVING?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.387
OH, MICHAEL.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.590
ONE DAY MICHAEL CAME IN
COMPLAINING ABOUT A SPEED BUMP

04:16.624 --> 04:19.293
ON THE HIGHWAY.

04:19.327 --> 04:22.396
I WONDER WHO HE RAN OVER THEN.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.997
IT'S ONLY MEREDITH.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.866
YEAH, IT'S ONLY MEREDITH.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.735
THANK GOD.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.870
BUT DID YOU SEE THE WAY
THEY LOOKED AT ME?

04:29.903 --> 04:31.972
LIKE I WAS A MURDERER
OR SOMETHING.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.343
HEY.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.344
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.645
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.547
WAS SHE TALKING BACK?
NO.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.048
JUST GOT SICK
OF THAT FACE?

04:41.081 --> 04:43.484
DID SHE OWE YOU MONEY?
UH-OH.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.018
IS THIS DOWNSIZING?

04:45.052 --> 04:49.490
DID SHE SPURN
YOUR ADVANCES?

04:49.523 --> 04:50.958
HEY, GUYS.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.693
WE'RE ALL GONNA VISIT
MEREDITH AT LUNCH.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.928
AND WE'RE KICKING IN
$5 FOR FLOWERS.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.064
WHO'S WE?
YOU AND JIM?

04:57.097 --> 04:59.367
NO, ME AND STANLEY
AND PHYLLIS SO FAR.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.703
OH.
I BET JIM GOES TOO.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.638
YEAH, I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM YET.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.774
OH.
I BET YOU ASK.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.841
I WAS PLANNING ON IT.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.110
I BET YOU WERE.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.045
ANGELA?
[whispers]
SUBTLE.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.647
WHAT?
ARE YOU COMING?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.916
I CAN'T.
SPRINKLES IS SICK.

05:15.949 --> 05:19.086
SHE'S BEEN SICK FOR SOME TIME.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

05:19.119 --> 05:22.923
NO ONE ASKS ABOUT SPRINKLES.

05:22.956 --> 05:23.924
I HAVE TO GIVE HER
HER MEDS,

05:23.957 --> 05:25.393
I HAVE TO PET HER.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.927
AND WHO WILL SHE
EAT LUNCH WITH?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.929
CAN'T YOUR OTHER CATS
KEEP HER COMPANY?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.631
THERE'S BAD BLOOD.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.999
JEALOUSIES,
CLIQUES.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.000
ANGELA,

05:33.033 --> 05:33.801
YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN

05:33.834 --> 05:35.369
OF THE PARTY PLANNING
COMMITTEE.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.904
I SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE PLANNING THIS.

05:36.937 --> 05:37.938
IT'S YOUR JOB.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.007
[sighs]

05:40.040 --> 05:41.341
ALL RIGHT!

05:42.843 --> 05:43.944
MY LORD, MY LIEGE.

05:43.977 --> 05:44.978
[Ryan on phone]
YES, MICHAEL?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.814
SO RYAN GOT PROMOTED
TO CORPORATE

05:46.847 --> 05:49.550
WHERE HE IS A LITTLE FISH
IN A BIG POND.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.952
WHEREAS BACK HERE IN SCRANTON,

05:51.985 --> 05:54.087
I AM STILL TOP DOG

05:54.121 --> 05:59.159
IN A FAIRLY LARGE POND.

05:59.192 --> 06:03.464
SO WHO IS THE REAL BOSS?

06:03.497 --> 06:07.468
THE DOG OR A FISH?

06:07.501 --> 06:09.737
SO I NEED A LITTLE TREAT
FOR THE GANG.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.939
SOMETHING TO WIN
THEIR AFFECTIONS BACK.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.140
BACK?

06:13.173 --> 06:14.575
WHY IS THAT, MICHAEL?

06:14.608 --> 06:17.711
WELL, I RAN DOWN MEREDITH
IN MY CAR.

06:17.745 --> 06:18.712
OH!

06:18.746 --> 06:19.880
DID YOU DO THIS
ON PURPOSE?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.482
NO, I WAS BEING
NEGLIGENT.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.717
BUT SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL,
SHE'S FINE,

06:23.751 --> 06:24.785
RECOVERING NICELY.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.454
TINY LITTLE CRACK
IN HER PELVIS.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.354
BUT SHE WILL BE--

06:27.387 --> 06:28.922
DID THIS HAPPEN
ON COMPANY PROPERTY?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.123
YES.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.459
IT WAS ON COMPANY PROPERTY

06:31.492 --> 06:32.860
WITH COMPANY PROPERTY.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.563
SO DOUBLE JEOPARDY.
WE ARE FINE.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.498
MM, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND

06:37.531 --> 06:39.132
HOW JEOPARDY WORKS.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.068
OH, RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.471
WHAT IS "WE'RE FINE"?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.473
[sighs]

06:45.506 --> 06:47.174
PEOPLE KEEP CALLING ME
A "WUNDERKIND."

06:47.207 --> 06:49.543
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.744
I MEAN, I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.547
IT MEANS VERY SUCCESSFUL
FOR YOUR AGE.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.916
SO I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE,
BUT...

06:55.949 --> 06:57.451
IT'S A WEIRD WORD.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.152
(Angela)
HEY, D.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.588
[whispering]
HEY MONKEY, WHAT'S UP?

07:00.621 --> 07:01.722
CAN YOU DO ME
A LITTLE FAVOR?

07:01.755 --> 07:04.024
GO TO MY PLACE AT LUNCH
AND GIVE SPRINKLES HER MEDICINE?

07:04.057 --> 07:05.025
SURE.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.860
I HAVE TO VISIT THE ALKIE.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.996
CHECK TO SEE
IF SHE'S FAKING.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.164
IF A CAR HIT ME,
IT WOULDN'T CRACK MY PELVIS.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.700
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.101
I BET SHE CRACKED IT
AT HOME.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.537
JUMPED IN FRONT OF THE CAR
TO GET SOME WORKER'S COMP.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.807
I WOULDN'T PUT IT
PAST HER.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.142
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED ME
TO DO?

07:22.175 --> 07:23.243
I WROTE IT OUT.
MM-HMM.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.778
THERE'S A DIABETES SHOT.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.113
ROLL THE INSULIN
IN YOUR HANDS,

07:26.146 --> 07:26.980
DON'T SHAKE IT.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.082
SHE GETS AN ACE INHIBITOR
WITH HER MEAL.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.484
BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT HER
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DISH,

07:30.518 --> 07:32.553
OR SHE WON'T SEE IT
BECAUSE OF THE CATARACTS.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.155
MIX ONE CAPSULE
OF OMEGA FATTY ACID

07:35.188 --> 07:36.657
IN WITH HER KIDNEY MEDICINE.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.559
UM, AND YOU WANNA
GIVE THAT TO HER

07:38.592 --> 07:41.161
15 MINUTES
AFTER SHE'S EATEN.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.063
AND, OH--THERE'S
A FUNGAL CREAM,

07:43.096 --> 07:45.098
BECAUSE SHE HAS THIS INFECTION
UNDER HER TAIL.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.099
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LIFT HER TAIL

07:46.133 --> 07:48.802
AND PUT THE CREAM
RIGHT AT THE BASE OF HER TAIL.

07:48.836 --> 07:52.172
OKAY, I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.173
YOU PUSHED DARRYL
OUT THE WINDOW?
NO.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.141
YOU SHOT DWIGHT?
NO.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.144
NO, THAT IS NOT FUNNY.
I LOVE MY EMPLOYEES.

07:57.177 --> 08:00.180
EVEN THOUGH I HIT ONE OF YOU
WITH MY CAR.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.650
FOR WHICH I TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.685
LOOK, I AM JUST TRYING TO TAKE
EVERYBODY'S MIND

08:04.718 --> 08:08.956
OFF OF THIS UNAVOIDABLE
TRAGEDY AND ON TO

08:08.989 --> 08:11.024
MORE POSITIVE THINGS.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.294
SO I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
PLANT A TREE.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.530
OH, GOOD. THAT MEANS
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORK.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.566
OKAY, WE'RE LEAVING
FOR THE HOSPITAL AT 1:00.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.267
SO, LIKE, A FREEDOM TREE.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.268
I CAN TAKE
THREE PEOPLE.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.703
I CAN ALSO TAKE
THREE PEOPLE.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.237
SEPARATE CARS.
(Michael)
PAM?

08:24.271 --> 08:25.706
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET A CARD
AT THE HOSPITAL,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.274
AND WE'LL SIGN IT
OUTSIDE HER ROOM.
PAM.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.142
SALES PEOPLE CAN GO
LATER IN THE DAY.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.578
HOURLY WORKERS
CAN GO AT LUNCH.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.645
OKAY, GOOD, GOOD.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.914
SO WE'LL JUST ALL GO DOWN THERE
TOGETHER AT LUNCH.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.015
EXCELLENT.
I-I WAS THINKING THAT--

08:35.048 --> 08:36.049
GOOD WORK, PAM.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.217
BUT IF YOU--

08:37.250 --> 08:39.720
YAAAAY, PAM!

08:39.753 --> 08:41.555
ALL RIGHT, SINCE I AM THE BOSS,
I WILL DRIVE

08:41.589 --> 08:42.556
AS WELL.

08:42.590 --> 08:43.557
WHO WANTS SHOTGUN?

08:43.591 --> 08:44.658
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.993
YOU RAN A WOMAN OVER
THIS MORNING.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.930
EVERYBODY INSIDE THE CAR
WAS FINE, STANLEY!

08:49.963 --> 08:52.299
(Michael)
GUESS WHAT? I HAVE FLAWS.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.001
WHAT ARE THEY?

08:54.034 --> 08:56.870
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I SING IN THE SHOWER.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.673
SOMETIMES I SPEND TOO MUCH TIME
VOLUNTEERING.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.342
OCCASIONALLY, I'LL HIT
SOMEBODY WITH MY CAR.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.944
SO SUE ME.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.113
NO, DON'T SUE ME.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.148
THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF THE POINT
THAT I AM TRYING TO MAKE.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.056
EW.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.057
(Michael)
I HATE HOSPITALS.

09:17.090 --> 09:21.629
IN MY MIND, THEY ARE ASSOCIATED
WITH SICKNESS.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.665
OH...

09:24.698 --> 09:26.166
SHE LOOKS LIKE AN ANGEL.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.300
SHE LOOKS AWFUL.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.301
NO--OKAY.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.336
SHE ALWAYS LOOKS
LIKE THAT.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.337
IT WAS NOT MY FAULT.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.005
I THINK SHE'S AWAKE.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.774
(Michael)
NO.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.810
SHE'S IN A COMA.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.346
NO.

09:39.379 --> 09:40.848
OKAY.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.817
* MEREDITH

09:43.851 --> 09:47.320
[hauntingly]
OOH!

09:47.354 --> 09:49.256
I BROUGHT ALL YOUR FRIENDS
FROM THE OFFICE, DEAR.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.291
AT THE SAME TIME.
YEP.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.693
HELLO, MEREDITH.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.961
THIS IS WEIRD.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.162
BROUGHT YOU SOME BALLOONS.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.666
WHY DON'T WE--
HERE YOU GO.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.267
TIE THESE UP,
CHEER UP YOUR TUBES.
[tube pops]

10:00.300 --> 10:02.703
OH, SHH--

10:02.736 --> 10:03.904
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.138
(Kevin)
WHOA.
NURSE!

10:05.172 --> 10:06.707
NO, DON'T BOTHER
THE NURSE.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.908
JUST PUT IT BACK IN.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.342
[groaning]

10:09.376 --> 10:11.044
I AM GOING TO BE SICK.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.713
I AM GOING TO PUKE.
I WOULDN'T--

10:12.746 --> 10:14.648
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
DON'T TOUCH IT.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.918
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JUST GIMME THAT.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.121
THANKS.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.056
[Kevin applauds]

10:23.090 --> 10:25.158
DOES IT HURT
TERRIBLY?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.393
NO, IT'S NOT TOO BAD.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.128
THEY HAVE ME ON A LOT
OF PAINKILLERS.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.963
OH, REALLY?
WHAT KIND? CODEINE?

10:29.997 --> 10:31.999
VICODIN?
PERCOCET?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.734
FENTANYL?
OXYCONTIN?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.135
PALLADONE?
WHAT?

10:35.168 --> 10:36.136
I HAVE NO IDEA.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.371
OH.
[chuckles]

10:38.405 --> 10:41.041
WELL, IT WAS REALLY GREAT

10:41.074 --> 10:43.410
OF ALL OF YOU TO COME AND VISIT
ME AT THE SAME TIME.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.412
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
AT THE OFFICE.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.014
[all saying farewells]

10:47.047 --> 10:48.015
OKAY, WAIT UP,
WAIT UP, GUYS.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.116
GUYS, GUYS, HOLD ON
A SEC.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.119
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING
MIGHT BE SORT OF FUN?

10:52.152 --> 10:55.856
IS IF YOU FORGAVE ME...
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.224
MICHAEL, I'M NOT
GONNA DO THAT.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.126
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY

10:59.159 --> 11:01.461
IN THE BIBLE
ABOUT FORGIVENESS?

11:01.494 --> 11:05.165
FORGIVENESS...
IS NEXT TO GODLINESS.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.000
NO, THAT'S NOT.
THAT'S CLEANLINESS.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.335
WELL, JUST SHH.
JUST--JUST--

11:08.368 --> 11:10.303
YOU CRACKED MY PELVIS.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.839
LOOK, I JUST--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

11:11.872 --> 11:13.807
WHAT IS PREVENTING YOU
FROM LAUGHING THIS OFF

11:13.841 --> 11:15.075
AND GIVING ME
A BIG HUG.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.409
YOU'RE NOT FORGIVEN.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.445
COME ON.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.446
MICHAEL!

11:19.479 --> 11:21.782
[all shouting]
MICHAEL!
AHH!

11:21.815 --> 11:23.183
DO I NEED TO BE LIKED?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.417
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.153
I LIKE TO BE LIKED.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.155
I ENJOY BEING LIKED.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.023
I HAVE TO BE LIKED.

11:30.057 --> 11:34.161
BUT IT'S NOT, LIKE,
THIS COMPULSIVE NEED

11:34.194 --> 11:35.796
TO BE LIKED.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.365
LIKE MY NEED
TO BE PRAISED.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.404
HEY.
HEY, MONKEY.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.939
ANY PROBLEMS?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.507
WELL, YOU LEFT
THE TV ON.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.877
AND YOUR CAT IS DEAD.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.078
WHAT?!

11:51.111 --> 11:52.312
SPARKLES, THE WHITE ONE,
IS DEAD.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.081
SPRINKLES.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.415
THAT WAS THE SICK ONE,
RIGHT?

11:55.448 --> 11:58.886
UH-HUH.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.420
[crying]

12:00.453 --> 12:02.255
BUT I THOUGHT
SHE HAD MORE TIME.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.256
NO.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.093
[crying]

12:06.126 --> 12:08.829
DID SHE LOOK--

12:08.862 --> 12:11.264
WHEN YOU SAW HER,
HOW WAS SHE LOOKING?

12:11.298 --> 12:12.365
REALLY DEAD.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.335
[sobbing]
LIKE A,
JUST A DEAD CAT.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.770
[sobbing]

12:16.804 --> 12:18.939
SO...
HEY, COME ON.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.841
DON'T BE SAD.
JUST...

12:20.874 --> 12:22.309
OKAY?
JUST...

12:22.342 --> 12:24.244
SHE'S IN A BETTER PLACE.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.079
ALL RIGHT.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.917
ACTUALLY, THE PLACE THAT SHE'S
IN IS THE FREEZER.

12:29.950 --> 12:30.918
BECAUSE OF THE ODOR.

12:30.951 --> 12:35.989
[sobbing]

12:36.023 --> 12:37.390
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.559
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:39.592 --> 12:42.896
EVERYBODY, LET'S JUST GET OVER
THE WHOLE MEREDITH THING.

12:42.930 --> 12:46.099
SHE CRACKED HER PELVIS.
A TINY, LITTLE CRACK.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.100
AND SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.101
SO LET'S JUST--

12:48.135 --> 12:50.103
MICHAEL, ANGELA'S CAT DIED.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.472
SPRINKLES?

12:53.874 --> 12:54.942
[sighs]

13:01.314 --> 13:03.050
OH, SH...

13:04.417 --> 13:05.886
I'M SORRY, ANGELA.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.856
MAN, WHAT A DAY, HUH?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.457
HOW COULD IT GET
ANY WORSE?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.492
HER COMPUTER CRASHES
WITH THE PORN,

13:12.525 --> 13:14.327
AND THEN MEREDITH
WITH THE ACCIDENT,

13:14.361 --> 13:15.328
AND THEN...

13:15.362 --> 13:17.464
SPRINKLES!

13:17.497 --> 13:19.199
GOD!

13:19.232 --> 13:20.433
THAT'S THREE THINGS.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.870
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.038
THIS OFFICE IS CURSED.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.107
[sighs]

13:27.140 --> 13:29.176
AND WE NEED TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.144
I AM TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.347
AND IT IS UP TO ME
TO GET RID OF THE CURSE

13:34.381 --> 13:38.185
THAT HIT MEREDITH
WITH MY CAR.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.420
I'M NOT SUPERSTITIOUS,
BUT...

13:40.453 --> 13:42.155
I'M--I AM A LITTLE STITIOUS.

13:45.225 --> 13:45.993
DID ANYONE DO ANYTHING

13:46.026 --> 13:48.061
INVOLVING
AN INDIAN BURIAL GROUND?

13:48.095 --> 13:49.162
LIKE WHAT?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.363
LIKE PARK ON IT.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.466
OR DIG UP A BODY.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.334
TOBY?

13:54.367 --> 13:56.937
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANNA TELL US?

13:56.970 --> 14:01.274
NO, I DID NOT VIOLATE
AN INDIAN BURIAL GROUND.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.977
IN FACT, I HAD
SOME GOOD LUCK RECENTLY.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.578
ALFREDO'S PIZZA PICKED
MY BUSINESS CARD

14:05.612 --> 14:08.348
OUT OF THE BASKET,
SO I GET A WEEK OF FREE PIES.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.250
(Pam)
THAT'S COOL.
YEAH.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.551
PERFECT.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.120
SO OUR TRAGEDY
IS YOUR GOOD LUCK.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.923
SATAN.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.225
(Angela)
SPRINKLES NEVER HURT
A SOUL.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.394
GOD, IN YOUR INFINITE WISDOM,
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?

14:21.428 --> 14:22.662
SHE WASN'T READY.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.531
SHE HAD SO MUCH LEFT
TO ACCOMPLISH.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.599
IT IS ONLY A CAT.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.368
YOU NEVER...

14:28.401 --> 14:30.370
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.040
CATS DO NOT PROVIDE MILK
OR WOOL OR MEAT.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.074
(man)
DWIGHT, PLEASE.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.642
DWIGHT, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
MEREDITH YET, HAVE YOU?

14:35.675 --> 14:36.609
NO, I HAVE NOT.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.311
WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD GO
TO THE HOSPITAL

14:38.345 --> 14:39.479
AND PAY YOUR RESPECTS.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.614
I DO NOT RESPECT HER.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.650
BUT I WILL GO.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.985
(Michael)
ALL RIGHT.

14:45.018 --> 14:48.055
I WOULD NOW LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT

14:48.088 --> 14:50.924
EACH OF YOUR INDIVIDUAL
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.127
OH, MICHAEL, YOU CAN'T ASK
ABOUT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.663
SATAN IS A MASTER
OF LIES.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.266
EVERYTHING HE SAYS
IS THE OPPOSITE.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.169
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN YOU CAN
ASK ABOUT RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.137
THANK YOU FOR THE PERMISSION.
PSYCH!

15:04.171 --> 15:05.405
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST GO
AROUND THE ROOM,

15:05.438 --> 15:07.540
AND--AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.510
UM, CATHOLIC.
(Michael)
OKAY.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.678
PRESBYTERIAN.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.080
OH, ME TOO.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.181
FOR REAL?
SAME RELIGION.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.283
ALL RIGHT.
COOL.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.685
UH, I'M A LUTHERAN,
AND BOB IS A UNITARIAN.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.387
IT KEEPS THINGS SPICY.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.289
THAT'S WHY WE'RE CURSED.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.324
(Creed)
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN A NUMBER OF CULTS,

15:24.357 --> 15:26.159
BOTH AS A LEADER
AND A FOLLOWER.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.128
YOU HAVE MORE FUN
AS A FOLLOWER.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.497
BUT YOU MAKE MORE MONEY
AS A LEADER.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.199
KELLY, YOU ARE HINDU.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.333
SO YOU BELIEVE IN BUDDHA.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.235
THAT'S BUDDHISTS.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.469
ARE YOU SURE?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.071
NO.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.706
WHAT ARE YOU?

15:39.739 --> 15:43.343
UH, WELL, IF YOU'RE GONNA REDUCE
MY IDENTITY TO MY RELIGION,

15:43.376 --> 15:44.611
THEN I'M SIKH.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.247
BUT I ALSO LIKE HIP-HOP
AND NPR.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.550
AND I'M RESTORING A 1967
CORVETTE IN MY SPARE TIME.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.152
OKAY.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.253
SO ONE SIKH,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.288
AND...

15:55.322 --> 15:57.457
(Dwight)
AS A FARMER,

15:57.490 --> 15:59.159
I KNOW THAT WHEN
AN ANIMAL IS SICK,

15:59.192 --> 16:01.194
SOMETIMES THE RIGHT THING
TO DO

16:01.228 --> 16:03.163
IS TO PUT IT
OUT OF ITS MISERY.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.732
WITH THE ELECTRICITY WE'RE USING
TO KEEP MEREDITH ALIVE,

16:05.765 --> 16:09.036
WE COULD POWER
A SMALL FAN FOR TWO DAYS.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.171
YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S UNETHICAL.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.007
BLINK ONCE IF YOU WANT ME
TO PULL THE PLUG.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.244
DON'T PULL ANY PLUGS.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.245
HOW ARE YOU DOING,
MISS PALMER?

16:18.278 --> 16:19.379
BETTER.
EXCELLENT.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.081
ARE YOU A DOCTOR
OR A MALE NURSE?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.316
UM, I'M AN INTERN,
WHICH MAKES ME A DOCTOR.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.252
PSH.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.055
HER CHART DOESN'T INDICATE
THAT SHE HAD A HYSTERECTOMY,

16:28.088 --> 16:30.490
BUT SHE DID, OR AT LEAST,
SHE GOT TIME OFF FOR ONE.

16:30.523 --> 16:35.362
AH, SO THAT IS
WHERE HER UTERUS WENT.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.597
UM, MISS PALMER, YOUR LAST
TETANUS SHOT WAS

16:37.630 --> 16:39.099
WHEN YOU WERE BITTEN
BY A BAT A FEW MONTHS AGO?

16:39.132 --> 16:40.167
YES.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.035
DWIGHT HERE TRAPPED IT
IN A BAG

16:42.069 --> 16:43.570
AGAINST MY HEAD.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.372
JUST DOING MY JOB.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.107
IT ALSO SAYS YOU WERE RECENTLY
BITTEN BY A RACCOON?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.641
AND A RAT.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.644
SEPARATE OCCASIONS.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.714
SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE TRYING
TO GET PEOPLE TO LIKE YOU,

16:54.747 --> 16:56.649
AND THEN YOU RUN OVER
ONE PERSON

16:56.683 --> 16:58.785
WITH YOUR CAR.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.121
AND IT'S NOT EVEN
ONE OF THE POPULAR ONES.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.355
EVERYBODY GETS
ON YOUR CASE.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.257
DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.226
GOD IS DEAD.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.429
IF THERE WAS A GOD, THEN RYAN
AND I WOULD BE MARRIED BY NOW.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.632
MAYBE BELIEVING IN GOD
WAS A MISTAKE.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.667
WHAT DID PEOPLE BELIEVE IN

17:14.701 --> 17:17.304
BEFORE?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.538
THE SUN?

17:18.571 --> 17:20.507
MAYBE THERE'S SOME

17:20.540 --> 17:24.311
SORT OF ANIMAL THAT WE COULD
MAKE A SACRIFICE TO.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.714
LIKE...A GIANT BUFFALO.

17:27.747 --> 17:32.452
OR SOME SORT OF MONSTER,
LIKE SOMETHING

17:32.485 --> 17:35.388
WITH THE BODY OF A WALRUS

17:35.422 --> 17:40.527
WITH THE HEAD OF A SEA LION.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.829
OR SOMETHING
WITH THE BODY

17:42.862 --> 17:46.533
OF AN EGRET

17:46.566 --> 17:48.401
WITH THE HEAD
OF A MEERKAT.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.671
OR JUST...

17:51.704 --> 17:55.575
THE HEAD OF A MONKEY WITH...

17:55.608 --> 17:58.077
THE ANTLERS OF A REINDEER.

18:00.347 --> 18:04.584
WITH THE BODY OF...

18:04.617 --> 18:07.687
UH...

18:07.720 --> 18:10.157
A PORCUPINE.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.460
I WILL DO SOME RESEARCH.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.461
(Michael)
OKAY.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.196
I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.134
SO JUST TO BE SAFE,

18:21.168 --> 18:22.535
THEY ARE GIVING HER
THE RABIES VACCINE.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.471
OHH!
GOD, RABIES?

18:24.504 --> 18:25.272
MM-HMM.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.840
I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM
WITH HER.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.876
HOW CONTAGIOUS IS THAT?
IS THAT LIKE AN STD?

18:29.909 --> 18:31.778
NO, NO. YOU GOTTA BE BITTEN
BY SOMETHING.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.446
THIS PLACE IS SO CURSED.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.381
ACTUALLY, THE DOCTOR SAID

18:34.414 --> 18:36.216
IT WAS LUCKY SHE CAME
INTO THE HOSPITAL,

18:36.249 --> 18:37.317
'CAUSE THE ONLY WAY
TO BEAT RABIES,

18:37.350 --> 18:40.320
IS TO START TREATMENT
BEFORE THE SYMPTOMS SET IN.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.421
LOCKJAW.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.563
I KNOW A LOT OF YOU
ARE VERY UPSET WITH ME

18:50.597 --> 18:53.500
FOR ENDANGERING MEREDITH'S LIFE
BY HITTING HER

18:53.533 --> 18:54.767
WITH MY CAR.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.237
BUT IT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL
A LITTLE BIT BETTER

18:57.270 --> 18:59.372
TO KNOW THAT BEFORE
THAT HAPPENED,

18:59.406 --> 19:01.741
DWIGHT ENDANGERED HER LIFE

19:01.774 --> 19:03.776
BY PUTTING A GARBAGE BAG
OVER HER HEAD

19:03.810 --> 19:05.845
AND IT HAD A BAT IN IT.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.747
SIX OF ONE, REALLY.

19:07.780 --> 19:11.751
TURNS OUT, MEREDITH
HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO RABIES.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.953
WHICH IS, LIKE, TEN TIMES

19:13.986 --> 19:16.956
WORSE THAN A LITTLE CRACK
IN YOUR PELVIS.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.925
THANKS TO ME, SHE WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL,

19:18.958 --> 19:21.228
AND THAT SAVED HER LIFE.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.895
CURSE IS BROKEN.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.897
CURSE IS BROKEN, PEOPLE!

19:24.931 --> 19:27.267
OH, THERE IS A GOD!

19:27.300 --> 19:29.336
AND HE HAS A PLAN FOR US
AFTER ALL.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.537
SO GO HOME,

19:30.570 --> 19:31.671
GET SOME REST.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.807
VERY, VERY GOOD WORK TODAY.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.878
GOT A LOT ACCOMPLISHED.

19:38.911 --> 19:39.812
IS THERE A GOD?

19:39.846 --> 19:43.316
IF NOT, WHAT ARE ALL THESE
CHURCHES FOR?

19:43.350 --> 19:47.186
AND WHO IS JESUS' DAD?

19:55.462 --> 19:56.829
(Kevin)
OH, WELL.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.498
IF THEY AREN'T TOGETHER NOW,

19:58.531 --> 20:00.333
THEN THEY PROBABLY
NEVER WILL BE.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.304
I THOUGHT THEY'D BE
GOOD TOGETHER.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.540
LIKE PB & J.

20:07.574 --> 20:12.712
PAM BEESLY AND JIM.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.914
WHAT A WASTE.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.550
WHAT A WASTE.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.886
(Pam)
I TOLD YOU
I'M NOT DATING ANYONE.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.289
AND EVEN IF I WAS,

20:22.322 --> 20:24.724
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ANYONE'S BUSINESS.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.494
I MEAN, WHEN I DO FALL IN LOVE,

20:27.527 --> 20:28.895
LIKE, WHEN IT'S FOR REAL,

20:28.928 --> 20:31.464
THE LAST PERSON I'M GONNA
TALK ABOUT IT TO

20:31.498 --> 20:38.638
IS A CAMERA CREW
OR MY COWORKERS.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.540
ALMOST MARRYING ROY ANDERSON

20:40.573 --> 20:42.442
WAS AS CLOSE TO PAMELA ANDERSON

20:42.475 --> 20:44.377
AS I EVER WANNA BE.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.414
TRUST ME, WHEN I FALL IN LOVE,
YOU'LL KNOW.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.655
[phone rings]

20:55.688 --> 20:57.290
MICHAEL SCOTT'S
DUNDER MIFFLIN SCRANTON

20:57.324 --> 20:58.758
MEREDITH PALMER MEMORIAL

20:58.791 --> 21:01.694
CELEBRITY RABIES AWARENESS
FUN RUN RACE FOR THE CURE,

21:01.728 --> 21:02.695
THIS IS PAM.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.530
[whispers]
PRO-AM.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.565
PRO-AM RACE FOR THE--
[dial tone]

21:05.598 --> 21:07.634
THEY HUNG UP.
OKAY.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.602
A WOMAN SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO BE HIT BY A CAR

21:09.636 --> 21:11.638
TO LEARN THAT
SHE MAY HAVE RABIES.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.707
BUT THAT IS WHERE WE ARE
IN AMERICA.

21:14.741 --> 21:18.445
AND THAT DOES NOT SIT RIGHT
WITH ME.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.414
AND THAT IS WHY I AM HOSTING
A FUN RUN

21:21.448 --> 21:23.816
RACE FOR THE CURE
FOR RABIES--

21:23.850 --> 21:26.052
TO RAISE AWARENESS
OF THE FACT

21:26.085 --> 21:28.555
THAT THERE IS A CURE
FOR RABIES.

21:28.588 --> 21:32.459
A DISEASE THAT HAS BEEN LARGELY
ERADICATED IN THE U.S.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.328
BUT NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE
KNOW THAT.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.997
NO, RABIES.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.799
BABIES WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.334
CAN I PUT YOU DOWN
FOR A DIME?

21:41.368 --> 21:43.603
[dial tone]

21:43.636 --> 21:46.005
HI, STANKLEY,
HOW MANY SPONSORS SO FAR?

21:46.038 --> 21:47.940
ZERO.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.008
COME ON, MAN.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.343
YOU GOTTA STEP IT UP.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.844
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.847
JAN CALLED THIS MORNING
AND PLEDGED $500.

21:54.881 --> 21:58.351
ISN'T THAT YOUR MONEY?

21:58.385 --> 22:03.356
THAT IS FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.891
PHYLLIS, HOW IS
THE RABIES QUILT COMING?

22:04.924 --> 22:05.892
OH, IT'S COMING.

22:05.925 --> 22:06.793
OH, LOOK AT THAT!

22:06.826 --> 22:08.928
THREE.
WAY TO HONOR MEREDITH, PHYLLIS.

22:08.961 --> 22:09.929
(Kevin)
MICHAEL?
YES?

22:09.962 --> 22:11.931
YOU CANNOT MAKE ME RUN.
OKAY.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.500
IT IS NOT
A REAL CHARITY.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.834
IT'S STUPID, MICHAEL.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.503
AND I'M NOT
GONNA DO IT.
ALL RIGHT.

22:16.536 --> 22:17.303
YOU DIDN'T RUN FOR ME

22:17.336 --> 22:18.905
WHEN I THOUGHT
I HAD SKIN CANCER.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.708
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
PROBABLY SCARED

22:21.741 --> 22:23.743
OF PEOPLE SEEING
YOUR FAT LEGS IN SHORTS.

22:23.776 --> 22:24.877
NO.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.546
OKAY.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.980
WELL, BACK IN OLDEN TIMES,

22:28.014 --> 22:31.150
A LARGE, FAT PERSON
LIKE THIS

22:31.183 --> 22:33.152
WAS A PERSON OF POWER.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.987
A PERSON WHO HAD MONEY,

22:35.021 --> 22:36.589
WHO COULD BUY FOOD.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.459
A PERSON OF RESPECT, LIKE
THE REGIONAL MANAGER OF THE DAY.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.962
WHEREAS SOMEONE ATHLETIC
AND TRIM LIKE MYSELF

22:42.995 --> 22:44.864
WAS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED
IN THE FIELDS,

22:44.897 --> 22:46.466
AND I WAS A PEASANT.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.967
I JUST DON'T WANNA RUN.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.537
I DIDN'T BRING MY SNEAKERS
OR MY CLOTHES.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.370
WELL, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO RUN

22:51.404 --> 22:53.039
OR YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

22:55.174 --> 22:59.646
IT IS NOT OLDEN TIMES
ANYMORE.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.981
I'M PETRIFIED
OF NIPPLE CHAFING.

23:02.014 --> 23:05.618
ONCE IT STARTS,
IT IS A VICIOUS CIRCLE.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.787
YOU HAVE SENSITIVE NIPPLES,
THEY CHAFE.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.088
SO THEY BECOME MORE SENSITIVE.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.790
SO THEY CHAFE MORE.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.559
[chuckling]
SO...

23:12.592 --> 23:13.826
I TAKE PRECAUTIONS.

23:15.795 --> 23:18.097
HEY, ANGELA.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.967
HEY, UM...

23:21.000 --> 23:24.203
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR CAT.

23:24.236 --> 23:28.708
[crying]

23:28.741 --> 23:30.577
THIS IS SPRINKLES.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.045
SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.783
I KEPT HER GOING
THROUGH COUNTLESS AILMENTS.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.786
I ASKED DWIGHT SCHRUTE
TO FEED HER ONCE,

23:39.819 --> 23:44.591
AND SHE IS NOW DECEASED.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.125
[sighing]

23:46.158 --> 23:49.596
THIS IS HALLOWEEN
LAST YEAR.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.765
JUST A COUPLE OF KITTENS.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.167
OUT ON THE TOWN.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.708
PSST!

24:07.580 --> 24:09.582
I'M HAVING RELATIONSHIP
PROBLEMS.

24:09.616 --> 24:12.218
AND SINCE YOU'RE ALWAYS HAVING
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS,

24:12.251 --> 24:14.621
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ABLE
TO GIVE ME SOME ADVICE.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.655
WHAT'S WRONG?

24:15.688 --> 24:17.757
I HAVE THIS CRAZY THOUGHT

24:17.790 --> 24:20.192
THAT I KNOW IS CRAZY.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.795
THAT MAYBE DWIGHT
KILLED MY CAT.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.063
HMM.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.064
WHEN I GOT HOME,

24:25.097 --> 24:27.133
SPRINKLES' BODY
WAS IN THE FREEZER

24:27.166 --> 24:28.735
WHERE DWIGHT SAID
HE LEFT HER.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.037
BUT ALL MY BAGS
OF FROZEN FRENCH FRIES

24:31.070 --> 24:32.505
HAD BEEN CLAWED TO SHREDS!

24:32.539 --> 24:33.640
OH.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.174
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

24:35.207 --> 24:36.909
THE VET'S DOING AN AUTOPSY.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.778
ANGELA, I'M SORRY.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.880
DID ROY EVER KILL
ONE OF YOUR CATS?

24:40.913 --> 24:43.650
I'M MORE
OF A DOG PERSON.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.752
[sighs]

24:48.087 --> 24:49.789
(Jim)
SO WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY
FOR THIS RACE?

24:49.822 --> 24:50.923
WELL, I'M GONNA START FAST.
MM-HMM.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.825
THEN I'M GONNA RUN FAST
IN THE MIDDLE.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.226
WHAT?
THEN I'M GONNA
END FAST.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.862
WHY WON'T MORE PEOPLE
DO THAT?

24:55.895 --> 24:59.666
'CAUSE THEY'RE STUPID.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.233
WHAT?

25:13.913 --> 25:16.883
OH, UM, NO, THAT'S NOT--

25:16.916 --> 25:18.217
I MEAN, THAT WASN'T--

25:18.250 --> 25:19.752
YEAH, THAT WAS, UM...

25:19.786 --> 25:21.854
I MEAN, I CAN SEE
HOW IT WOULD SEEM A BIT

25:21.888 --> 25:23.623
LIKE WE, UH...

25:23.656 --> 25:26.058
HOW IT LOOKS LIKE, UM...

25:26.092 --> 25:28.227
BUT, I MEAN, NOWADAYS,
YOU CAN EDIT ANYTHING, RIGHT?

25:28.260 --> 25:30.730
I MEAN, YOU CAN EDIT
ANYTHING TO...

25:30.763 --> 25:33.099
LOOK LIKE, UM, ANYTHING.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.901
SO.
YEAH, I GAVE HIM
A RIDE HOME.

25:34.934 --> 25:37.904
BECAUSE...
RIGHT.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.339
WE'RE DATING.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.741
WOW.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.810
THERE IT IS.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.912
UH, YEAH.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.580
WE HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY.

25:47.614 --> 25:50.850
BUT IT'S GOING
REALLY GREAT.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.284
RIGHT?

25:52.318 --> 25:54.587
IT IS GOING REALLY GREAT.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.355
OW!

25:56.388 --> 25:57.690
SHUT UP.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.025
YOU'RE TAKING THIS OUT
ON ME,

25:59.058 --> 26:00.593
BUT I WAS ONLY
THE MESSENGER.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.261
OH, REALLY?

26:06.799 --> 26:09.736
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
AFTER THE 5K.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.771
EXERCISE
IS GOOD FOR DEPRESSION.

26:11.804 --> 26:12.805
I AM NOT DEPRESSED.

26:12.839 --> 26:16.943
I'M IN GRIEF!

26:16.976 --> 26:19.812
WE HAVE RAISED ALMOST $700,

26:19.846 --> 26:21.648
MOST OF IT FROM ME AND JAN.

26:21.681 --> 26:25.051
UM...WHEN DO THEY PUT THAT
ON THE GIANT CHECK?

26:25.084 --> 26:28.020
OR IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT WE WRITE IN LATER?

26:28.054 --> 26:31.958
WELL, A GIANT CHECK COSTS
ABOUT $200 TO MAKE UP.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.359
I HAVE A PRINT SHOP
STANDING BY, BUT--

26:33.392 --> 26:34.393
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MICHAEL?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.228
THAT'S OVER 25%
OF OUR FUNDS.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.865
MM.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.900
IT'S...A TOUGH DECISION.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.035
UM...

26:43.069 --> 26:44.270
I ALWAYS IMAGINED IT
WITH A GIANT CHECK.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.772
YEAH, I MEAN, I PERSONALLY

26:45.805 --> 26:47.306
AM DEFINITELY ON BOARD
FOR THE GIANT CHECK.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.307
GIANT CHECK IT IS.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.009
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.778
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT DOES LEAVE LESS MONEY

26:51.811 --> 26:53.846
FOR BAT BIRTH CONTROL.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.782
BAT BIRTH CONTROL.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.149
WAIT, THIS MONEY IS GOING

26:57.183 --> 26:58.117
TO BAT BIRTH CONTROL,
RIGHT, MICHAEL?

26:58.150 --> 26:59.852
THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME
WHEN I CONTRIBUTED.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.654
YOU DIDN'T CONTRIBUTE
VERY MUCH.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.990
I WAS ALSO HOPING
TO HAND

27:04.023 --> 27:06.425
THE GIANT CHECK
TO A RABIES DOCTOR.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.794
HOW'S THAT GOING?

27:07.827 --> 27:08.795
NOT WELL.

27:08.828 --> 27:09.896
A DOCTOR WON'T COME OUT

27:09.929 --> 27:11.831
TO COLLECT A CHECK
FOR $700.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.033
OR $500 IF WE GO
WITH THE GIANT CHECK.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.034
WHICH WE ARE.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.002
AND ALSO...

27:16.035 --> 27:19.038
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A RABIES DOCTOR.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.807
HOW ABOUT A RABIES NURSE?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.108
I DON'T THINK SO.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.409
I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN ADS

27:23.442 --> 27:25.311
FOR NURSES THAT YOU CAN HIRE
BY THE HOUR.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.279
FOR, UH, PARTIES
AND BACHELOR EVENTS.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.782
THAT'S POSSIBLE.
LOOK INTO THAT.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.417
GREAT. IT'S GONNA COST
A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.152
AND, UH--
OH, ACTUALLY, MORE...

27:33.185 --> 27:35.054
WITH TIPS.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.455
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SKIP THE CEREMONY

27:36.488 --> 27:39.225
AND JUST SET UP A COLLEGE FUND
FOR MEREDITH'S SON.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.694
HAVE YOU MET THAT KID?

27:41.728 --> 27:44.997
NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.466
MICHAEL.

27:47.499 --> 27:52.338
5K MEANS FIVE KILOMETERS,
NOT 5,000 MILES.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.840
COME IN!

27:53.873 --> 27:54.841
HEY.
HEY, HEY!

27:54.874 --> 27:55.842
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:55.875 --> 27:56.743
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

27:56.776 --> 27:58.144
YOU SAID, "COME IN!"
NO, I DIDN'T.
JUST--

27:58.177 --> 27:59.145
OH, MY GOD.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.179
PLEASE, GET OUT.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.783
SO I CLOSED THE DOOR,
BUT THE IMAGE OF HIS--

28:03.816 --> 28:04.784
BAGUETTE.

28:04.817 --> 28:05.985
DANGLING PARTICIPLE.
OOH.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.087
STILL BURNED
IN MY EYES.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.088
I CAN IMAGINE.

28:09.121 --> 28:12.024
[knocking]

28:12.058 --> 28:13.960
COME IN.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.427
MAY I ENTER
THE ROOM?

28:15.461 --> 28:20.099
YES.
OR "COME IN."

28:20.132 --> 28:23.302
SEE HOW I DID THAT?

28:23.335 --> 28:24.971
THAT'S THE WAY
YOU SHOULD ENTER A ROOM.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.806
YOU KNOCK AND THEN YOU WAIT
FOR THE ALL CLEAR.

28:26.839 --> 28:27.807
YOU COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN OFF
ALL YOUR CLOTHES

28:27.840 --> 28:28.808
IN THE MEN'S ROOM?
YES.

28:28.841 --> 28:31.243
BUT I HAVE AN OFFICE,
SO WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

28:31.277 --> 28:32.444
ON AVERAGE,
HOW MANY HOURS A DAY

28:32.478 --> 28:34.246
DO YOU SPEND
NAKED IN YOUR OFFICE?

28:34.280 --> 28:35.114
JUST BALLPARK.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.783
EUROPEAN OFFICES
ARE NAKED ALL THE TIME.

28:36.816 --> 28:37.750
THEY'RE SO NOT.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.852
BESIDES, MY SHIRTTAIL COVERED
MOST OF IT, SO--

28:39.886 --> 28:41.320
I DIDN'T SEE WHERE IT STARTED,
BUT I SAW WHERE IT ENDED.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.222
PHEW, GROSS.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.791
THAT'S NOT GROSS!
IT IS THE HUMAN BODY.

28:44.824 --> 28:45.958
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

28:45.992 --> 28:48.060
PAM, YOU'RE AN ARTIST,
RIGHT?

28:48.094 --> 28:49.796
THINK OF ME AS ONE
OF YOUR MODELS.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.764
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:51.798 --> 28:52.832
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO DETRACT

28:52.865 --> 28:55.201
FROM WHAT WE REALLY NEED
TO BE THINKING ABOUT TODAY.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.369
IT'S NOT FAIR
TO PEOPLE WITH RABIES.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.439
AND THAT'S THE POINT.
RIGHT?

29:00.472 --> 29:01.440
OKAY.

29:01.473 --> 29:02.441
LET'S GO HAVE SOME FUN.

29:02.474 --> 29:03.876
ALL RIGHT.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.411
THEY SAY IF YOU'RE
NERVOUS AROUND SOMEONE,

29:05.444 --> 29:07.213
YOU SHOULD PICTURE THEM NAKED.

29:07.246 --> 29:10.016
I DO NOT RECOMMEND
THIS STRATEGY.

29:10.049 --> 29:12.418
TRY PICTURING THEM
WITH MORE CLOTHES ON.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.453
OR A FUNNY COAT.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.991
OH, I'M SORRY,
IS THIS A WORKING OFFICE?

29:19.025 --> 29:21.928
AND NOT A FRENCH BEACH?

29:21.961 --> 29:24.030
OKAY, NAME, PLEASE?

29:24.063 --> 29:26.098
CREED BRATTON,
75+ DIVISION.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.533
YOU'RE OVER 75 YEARS OLD?

29:27.566 --> 29:29.168
82 NOVEMBER 1st.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.236
HOW MUCH IS THE PRIZE MONEY?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.171
THERE'S NO PRIZE MONEY.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.439
WELL, IS ANY OF THIS REAL?

29:33.472 --> 29:35.107
CHECK THAT OUT.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.109
[mocking]
LOOK AT ME, I'M TOBY!

29:37.143 --> 29:38.544
I'M STRETCHING.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.079
WHY IS HE EVEN HERE?

29:43.983 --> 29:47.920
SO I HEARD THAT YOU
WERE PEEPING ON MICHAEL.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.555
WHAT?
NO, IT WAS NOT--

29:49.588 --> 29:51.257
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR DEAL IS,

29:51.290 --> 29:52.591
BUT HE'S MINE, OKAY?

29:52.624 --> 29:53.860
SO HANDS OFF.

29:53.893 --> 29:57.129
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP!

29:57.163 --> 29:59.398
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.167
BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
I WANTED TO SAY

30:01.200 --> 30:03.469
A FEW WORDS ABOUT

30:03.502 --> 30:05.404
THIS DEADLY DISEASE
CALLED RABIES.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.274
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE A LOOK

30:08.307 --> 30:12.411
INTO THE FACE OF RABIES.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.146
THAT SHOULD SCARE YOU.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.915
IT SCARES ME.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.549
YOU PEOPLE NEED
TO EDUCATE YOURSELVES.

30:17.583 --> 30:21.253
MYTH: THREE AMERICANS
EVERY YEAR DIE FROM RABIES.

30:21.287 --> 30:26.392
FACT: FOUR AMERICANS
EVERY YEAR DIE FROM RABIES.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.260
HOW MANY OF YOU

30:28.294 --> 30:30.529
KNOW SOMEONE
WHO HAS BEEN AFFLICTED

30:30.562 --> 30:31.898
OR AFFECTED BY RABIES?

30:31.931 --> 30:34.066
SHOW OF HANDS.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.068
ONE, TWO, THREE--
TOO MANY TO COUNT.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.204
IT IS TRULY
THE SILENT KILLER.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.373
NO, IT IS THE FOAMING,
BARKING KILLER.

30:41.407 --> 30:44.410
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT--
DARRYL!

30:44.443 --> 30:46.045
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:46.078 --> 30:47.113
I'M GIVING HIM A PEANUT.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.347
NO, DON'T GIVE HIM--

30:48.380 --> 30:51.183
DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING
I SAID?

30:51.217 --> 30:52.952
LOOK HOW HAPPY HE IS.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.286
HE'S HAPPY
BECAUSE HE'S INSANE.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.287
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:55.321 --> 30:57.456
THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF THE KIND OF AWARENESS

30:57.489 --> 30:58.624
WE NEED TO GENERATE.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.226
WHERE'S THE NURSE?

31:00.259 --> 31:02.461
THIS IS THE REASON
WE'RE HERE.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.896
HELLO, MICHAEL.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.565
OH, HEY, I KNOW YOU.
ELIZABETH, RIGHT?
YEAH.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.367
(Michael)
WOW.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.236
VERY COOL YOU WENT BACK
AND GOT YOUR DEGREE.

31:10.269 --> 31:14.974
I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO ACCEPT THIS CHECK

31:15.007 --> 31:18.210
FOR $340

31:18.244 --> 31:20.947
MADE OUT TO SCIENCE.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.481
MAKE SURE THAT THAT
GETS INTO THE RIGHT HANDS.

31:22.514 --> 31:23.549
RIGHT.

31:23.582 --> 31:27.519
[applause and cheering]

31:27.553 --> 31:29.055
YOU GOT IT?

31:29.088 --> 31:30.222
(Dwight)
MM-HMM.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.423
OKAY.

31:31.457 --> 31:35.928
FETTUCCINE ALFREDO.

31:35.962 --> 31:38.097
TIME TO CARBO LOAD.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.202
MMM.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.503
JUST REMEMBER, FOLKS,
IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.238
IT IS ABOUT FINISHING.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.942
ON YOUR MARKS!

31:49.976 --> 31:52.011
GET SET!

31:52.044 --> 31:53.545
DOWN!

31:53.579 --> 31:55.581
[gunshot]

32:07.393 --> 32:08.995
(Michael)
ON YOUR LEFT!

32:09.028 --> 32:09.962
WOW, YOU'RE FAST.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.364
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, MICHAEL.
LOOK AT YOU GO!

32:12.398 --> 32:14.066
THAT'S MY BOSS!

32:14.100 --> 32:15.734
YEAH, BABY!

32:15.767 --> 32:17.636
I'M FAST.
I'M VERY FAST.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.238
I'M LIKE FORREST GUMP,

32:19.271 --> 32:22.474
EXCEPT I AM NOT AN IDIOT.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.678
(Stanley)
OH, YES, I WILL
WORK OUT TODAY.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.114
I WILL WORK OUT A WAY

32:28.147 --> 32:31.117
TO AVOID RUNNING
FOR A STUPID CAUSE.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.652
(Andy)
I'VE WALKED TWO MARATHONS.

32:33.685 --> 32:36.222
PRETTY SURE
I CAN HANDLE A 5K.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.524
[chuckling]
THE KEY IS DRAFTING

32:38.557 --> 32:40.659
TO ELIMINATE
WIND RESISTANCE.

32:44.596 --> 32:48.200
[giggling]
YEAH.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.701
OH, WE'RE IN
LAST PLACE.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.103
OH, WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THAT?

32:51.137 --> 32:52.438
DARN IT.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.644
WATER!

32:58.677 --> 33:00.579
WATER.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.414
OH!
WATER, BABE?

33:02.448 --> 33:03.682
NO, NO WATER FOR ME.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.052
NOT WHILE RABIES
CAUSES FEAR OF WATER.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.086
SOLIDARITY!

33:07.119 --> 33:08.620
MICHAEL, THAT'S IRRATIONAL!

33:08.654 --> 33:11.390
RABIES VICTIMS...

33:11.423 --> 33:14.360
HAVE TO LIVE WITH
AN IRRATIONAL HATRED OF WATER

33:14.393 --> 33:15.727
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.

33:15.761 --> 33:19.365
SO...LEAST I COULD DO.

33:19.398 --> 33:23.069
OH, GOD.
MY NIPPLES.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.537
IT'S STARTING.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.206
(Creed)
CAN WE GET ANOTHER ROUND?

33:27.239 --> 33:29.675
OKAY.
THANKS.

33:29.708 --> 33:33.145
SO WE'VE GOT WHAT?
ANOTHER 20 MINUTES?

33:33.179 --> 33:35.314
MORE OR LESS.
MMM.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.551
THAT FETTUCCINI...

33:39.585 --> 33:42.354
IS HITTING MY STOMACH
LIKE A ROCK.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.423
YOU GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.492
I PUT IMODIUM IN TOBY'S
COFFEE BEFORE THE RACE.

33:46.525 --> 33:49.328
[ragged laughter]
EXCELLENT!

33:49.361 --> 33:51.363
SIMPSONS!

33:51.397 --> 33:54.500
WAIT, IMODIUM OR EX-LAX?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.235
I'M MAKING GREAT TIME.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.204
USUALLY I HAVE TO TAKE
A BATHROOM BREAK

33:58.237 --> 33:59.505
HALFWAY THROUGH
A RACE LIKE THIS.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.674
BUT...NOT TODAY.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.412
OOH, AN ESTATE SALE.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.514
WANT TO GO IN?

34:08.547 --> 34:10.549
I DON'T KNOW, I'M REALLY
COMMITTED TO WINNING.

34:10.582 --> 34:11.850
OKAY, BUT WHAT IF
I TOLD YOU

34:11.883 --> 34:13.385
THAT ALL THE MONEY
YOU SPEND HERE

34:13.419 --> 34:14.420
GOES TO PREVENTING
A DISEASE

34:14.453 --> 34:15.421
THAT'S ALREADY
BEEN CURED.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.655
MMM, YES.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.090
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.325
YEAH.
RIGHT?

34:19.358 --> 34:21.093
LET'S DO SOME GOOD.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.694
[phone dialing on speaker]

34:22.728 --> 34:23.862
(Pam)
YOU HAVE REACHED THE OFFICES

34:23.895 --> 34:25.397
OF DUNDER MIFFLIN SCRANTON.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.399
CURRENTLY THE ENTIRE STAFF
IS OUT DOING

34:27.433 --> 34:29.668
THE MICHAEL SCOTT
D.M.S.M.P.M.C.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.138
RABIES AWARNESS PRO AM
FUN RUN RACE...

34:32.171 --> 34:33.772
(Michael)
FOR THE CURE.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.407
(Pam)
LEAVE A MESSAGE.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.545
[burps]
OH, GOD.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.581
OH, ALFREDO SAUCE.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.783
I'M GETTING A STITCH.
AHH!

34:46.685 --> 34:47.819
OW!
GOD!

34:47.853 --> 34:50.156
WATCH THE NIPPLES, KEVIN!

34:50.189 --> 34:52.424
BACK OFF ME.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.892
HOW YOU FEELING?
BETTER?

34:53.925 --> 34:55.161
NO.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.828
WELL, YOU LOOK
CUTE AS BUTTON.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.330
YOU'VE WORKED UP
QUITE A SWEAT.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.166
THE VET IS REMOVING
ALL OF SPRINKLES ORGANS

35:00.199 --> 35:01.900
RIGHT NOW AND SENDING
THEM TO THE LAB.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.170
I AM A FARMER, ANGELA.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.204
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.406
OKAY, WHEN A FARMER SEES
AN ANIMAL THAT IS IN PAIN,

35:07.439 --> 35:08.840
THAT HAS
NO QUALITY OF LIFE,

35:08.874 --> 35:10.442
THAT HAS NO UTILITY,

35:10.476 --> 35:13.745
A FARMER DOES WHAT CITY FOLK
DON'T HAVE THE STOMACH TO DO.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.747
YOU DID KILL HER!

35:15.781 --> 35:18.917
I-I SANG HER
HER FAVORITE SONGS.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.552
YOU PUT HER
IN MY FREEZER!

35:20.586 --> 35:22.788
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND GENTLE AND RESPECTFUL.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.457
I FED HER ANTIHISTAMINES
AND SHE GRADUALLY FELL ASLEEP.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.159
WELL, THEN SHE BARFED
THEM UP IN THE FREEZER

35:27.193 --> 35:28.260
AND TRIED TO GET OUT.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.329
WELL, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT--HEY!

35:30.362 --> 35:32.731
OW!
IT'S OKAY!

35:32.764 --> 35:33.732
IT'S NOTHING!
I'M ROBBING HER!

35:33.765 --> 35:36.268
IT'S NOTHING!
IT'S FINE!

35:36.302 --> 35:38.570
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT
WITHOUT TELLING ME?

35:38.604 --> 35:39.938
I THOUGHT I WAS
HELPING YOU.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.573
I EXPECTED A HUG.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.409
I TOOK CARE OF THAT CAT

35:43.442 --> 35:45.844
THE BEST WAY I KNEW HOW.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.614
CAT HEAVEN
IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.617
BUT YOU DON'T GET THERE
IF YOU'RE EUTHANIZED.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.951
I KNOW
A GREAT TAXIDERMIST.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.753
I'LL PAY
TO HAVE HER STUFF.

35:54.786 --> 35:55.954
WELL, HE'S NOT GREAT,
BUT HE'S PRETTY GOOD.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.824
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.860
TAKE BAT BITES SERIOUSLY.
DON'T GET BIT.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.231
OR WE CAN HAVE HER
BURIED OUT

36:05.264 --> 36:08.700
AT THE EAST FIELD
BY MOTHER.

36:08.734 --> 36:09.901
HUH, ANGELA?

36:09.935 --> 36:11.837
DON'T TOUCH ME, DWIGHT.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.682
YOU LIKE IT?

36:23.715 --> 36:24.950
IT'S KIND OF
DESIGNY AND COOL.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.918
IT WAS $8.

36:26.952 --> 36:30.322
OH, AND I GET TO CARRY IT.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.901
[chuckling]

36:42.934 --> 36:46.672
AND THE WINNER
IS TOBY FLENDERSON!

36:46.705 --> 36:49.341
HAVE A SEAT.
I'LL WRITE IT DOWN.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.381
WHERE ARE WE?

36:55.414 --> 36:56.515
I DON'T KNOW.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.517
LIKE FIVE KILOMETERS
FROM THE OFFICE.

36:58.550 --> 37:02.354
HE COULDN'T HAVE
MADE IT A CIRCLE?

37:10.496 --> 37:11.963
I AM NOT GOING
TO FINISH.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.369
I CAN'T BEAT RABIES.

37:17.403 --> 37:18.904
NOBODY CAN BEAT RABIES.

37:18.937 --> 37:22.341
(Michael)
RABIES HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.710
I WAS FOOL TO THINK
THAT I COULD BEAT IT.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.647
[Michael groaning]

37:29.848 --> 37:30.949
PICTURES OF THE DOG
ALL AROUND.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.784
YEAH, PROBABLY--
HEY.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.888
MICHAEL?

37:36.922 --> 37:38.490
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37:38.524 --> 37:39.758
DID YOU COME BACK
FOR US OF--

37:39.791 --> 37:41.827
I CAN'T FINISH.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.995
I FEEL SO WEAK.
I JUST--

37:44.029 --> 37:45.597
WELL, YOU'RE
PROBABLY DEHYDRATED.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.032
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, JIM?

37:47.065 --> 37:48.967
A GLASS OF WATER
WOULD BE A START.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.703
NO, THERE ARE PEOPLE...

37:51.737 --> 37:54.373
ALL OVER THE WORLD
WITH ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS

37:54.406 --> 37:56.708
AND AFFLICTIONS
AND DISEASES.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.377
THEY'RE DEFORMED

37:58.410 --> 38:00.646
AND THEY'RE ABNORMAL.

38:00.679 --> 38:04.783
AND...THEY'RE ILLITERATE
AND UGLY.

38:04.816 --> 38:07.719
SYMPHONIES DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.421
PUBLIC TV IS BUST.

38:09.455 --> 38:11.089
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.058
I CAN'T, YOU KNOW--

38:13.091 --> 38:15.794
THERE'S JUST ONE OF ME,

38:15.827 --> 38:19.030
AND THERE'S THOUSAND
OF THEM.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.566
AND RABIES WINS.

38:20.599 --> 38:23.569
WOW, YOU ARE A DOWNER.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.671
WE WERE HAVING
A PRETTY NICE DAY.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.105
I'M STILL HAVING
A NICE DAY.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.940
YOU ARE?
YEAH.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.776
HEY, MICHAEL,
LOOK AT THIS LAMP.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.811
$8.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.413
THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.

38:36.382 --> 38:39.751
AND MICHAEL,
YOU DON'T HAVE RABIES.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.588
AND CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET IT ANYTIME SOON.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.857
SO YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.827
PAM, IF EVERYBODY
FELT THAT WAY,

38:48.860 --> 38:50.095
NOTHING WOULD GET DONE.

38:50.128 --> 38:54.433
YEAH, BUT THERE'S
OTHER BETTER PEOPLE

38:54.466 --> 38:56.067
OUT THERE
WHO ARE HELPING.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.804
YOU JUST DON'T THINK
I AM CAPABLE

38:58.837 --> 39:00.539
OF MAKING A DIFFERENCE.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.742
I KNOW YOU, MICHAEL.

39:03.775 --> 39:05.577
I SAW YOU NAKED.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.846
YOU DON'T--

39:07.879 --> 39:09.848
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.483
YOU'VE JUST SEEN
MY PENIS.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.519
I CAN MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.853
REMEMBER, I'M THE ONE

39:14.886 --> 39:16.422
WHO STARTED
THIS WHOLE THING OFF

39:16.455 --> 39:19.157
BY HITTING MEREDITH
WITH MY CAR.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.792
AND I OWE IT TO HER

39:20.826 --> 39:24.062
TO FINISH THIS G.D. 5K.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.831
OH!

39:28.534 --> 39:31.069
NO, NO!

39:35.006 --> 39:37.008
[moaning]

39:43.515 --> 39:46.552
(Michael)
FINISHING THAT 5K

39:46.585 --> 39:49.988
WAS THE HARDEST THING
I HAVE EVER HAD TO DO.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.726
I ATE MORE
FETTUCCINE ALFREDO

39:54.760 --> 39:58.630
AND DRANK LESS WATER
THAN I HAVE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.632
[cheers and applause]

40:00.666 --> 40:03.935
PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT
TRIUMPHS OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT.

40:03.969 --> 40:07.973
WELL, TODAY I HAD A TRIUMPH
OF THE HUMAN BODY.

40:08.006 --> 40:11.443
THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY WAS
APPLAUDING FOR ME AT THE END.

40:11.477 --> 40:15.814
MY GUTS AND MY HEART.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.984
AND WHILE I EVENTUALLY
PUKED MY GUTS OUT,

40:19.017 --> 40:23.755
I NEVER PUKED
MY HEART OUT.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.791
AND I'M VERY,
VERY PROUD OF THAT.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.497
(Meredith)
HEY, MICHAEL.
HEY, MER.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.798
HOW YOU DOING?

40:32.831 --> 40:33.932
BETTER.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.667
IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

40:35.701 --> 40:37.469
I MEAN, I'M IN THE HOSPITAL

40:37.503 --> 40:38.670
FOR NOT GETTING
ENOUGH WATER.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.639
AND YOU'RE IN IT
FOR A DISEASE

40:40.672 --> 40:42.207
THAT CAUSES
A FEAR OF WATER.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.676
I'M IN BECAUSE
YOU HIT ME WITH YOUR CAR.

40:44.710 --> 40:47.245
OH.
BUT I WANT TO SAY...

40:47.278 --> 40:49.515
I HEARD YOU WERE
TRYING REALLY HARD,

40:49.548 --> 40:52.584
SO...I'M NOT MAD
AT YOU ANYMORE.

40:52.618 --> 40:55.554
THANKS.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.590
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU
ANYMORE.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.694
[sighs]

41:05.030 --> 41:07.132
WANT TO SHARE?

41:07.165 --> 41:08.934
SURE.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.102
I'M NOT REALLY SICK.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.580
I'M GOOD.
