00:00.834 --> 00:02.202
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.235 --> 00:04.571
Amanda,
I'm Lucy Hatcher,

00:04.605 --> 00:07.307
a counselor from
the Rape Crisis Center.

00:07.340 --> 00:10.110
-How old are you?
-Eleven.

00:10.143 --> 00:11.578
HELEN: The good news is
we caught him.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.346
At least,
I'm pretty sure of it.

00:13.379 --> 00:15.315
I was wondering whether
you'd be able to look

00:15.348 --> 00:17.083
at what we call
a police lineup.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.819
No, I don't want
to see him.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.187
I don't think she's strong
enough emotionally to see him.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.556
I really don't.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.425
This whole case comes down
to eyewitness testimony.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.427
So it would be
her word against his?

00:27.460 --> 00:29.630
No, we have
another eyewitness.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.798
A woman saw it
from a balcony.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.767
Are you sure
about the man you saw?

00:33.800 --> 00:35.401
Yes.
He lives in the building.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.570
I know who he is.

00:36.603 --> 00:37.771
Miss Tritter,
I smell alcohol.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.305
Have you been drinking?

00:39.339 --> 00:40.674
I've had a few beers.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.609
At the time you saw the rape,
were you drinking then?

00:42.643 --> 00:43.810
Two beers.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.746
HELEN: All I have
is an eyewitness

00:45.779 --> 00:48.348
who was probably
under the influence.

00:48.381 --> 00:52.318
Even with your daughter
testifying...

00:52.352 --> 00:54.855
she's easily shakeable,
Mr. McGowan.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.289
What are you telling me?

00:56.322 --> 00:58.592
It doesn't look good.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.433
What do you mean,
no plea?

01:07.467 --> 01:09.770
He backed out of the deal.
He wants to go to trial.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.672
He can't do that.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.339
Unfortunately, he can.

01:13.373 --> 01:15.241
Until the plea is entered
with the judge, he has--

01:15.275 --> 01:16.810
Does this mean
she'll have to testify?

01:16.843 --> 01:19.680
It means she might.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.683
You have
the other witness.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.350
I can't make this case

01:24.384 --> 01:27.353
with Michelle Tritter alone,
Howard. You know this.

01:27.387 --> 01:30.256
Amanda will probably
have to take the stand.

01:30.290 --> 01:35.662
I will do everything I can
to protect her.

01:38.231 --> 01:43.469
Maybe if Michelle Tritter's
testimony is compelling enough,

01:43.504 --> 01:47.307
we could reintroduce
the idea of a plea

01:47.340 --> 01:49.475
to spare Amanda from...

01:49.510 --> 01:52.779
Look, Howard,

01:52.813 --> 01:55.849
I don't want
to be a killer D. A. here.

01:55.882 --> 01:57.918
You want
to call this off?

01:57.951 --> 01:58.919
We can't.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.921
He lives in our building.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.488
If he goes free,

02:02.523 --> 02:05.258
she's got to see him
every day.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.628
He could rape her again.
He's that sick.

02:11.264 --> 02:15.335
Do what you have to do
to get him, Ms. Gamble,

02:15.368 --> 02:18.471
but try to spare
my little girl.

02:22.442 --> 02:25.445
â™ª (theme)

03:14.661 --> 03:16.462
Jimmy.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.464
Michaelson.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.267
I worked out
an installment plan.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.503
I know this,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.237
but his first payment
was due last Friday.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.872
I'll call him.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.308
I'd appreciate it
if you could call him today.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.876
(door opens)

03:32.378 --> 03:36.449
Excuse me. I'm here
to see Robert Donnell.

03:36.482 --> 03:37.784
You are...

03:37.818 --> 03:39.319
Kate Littlefield.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.987
Yes, he's expecting you.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.689
Can I get you
some coffee or something?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.724
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.291
Right this way.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.899
I bet she's stopped
some traffic once or twice.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.967
Who is she?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.468
Oh, whoa, whoa.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.903
Ooh, are you okay?

03:56.937 --> 04:00.373
Oh, yeah. That was
no kick, though. Ow.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.474
You all right?

04:01.508 --> 04:02.709
(sighs)

04:02.743 --> 04:04.878
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just -- Ahem.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.412
I'm going to sit.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.953
Thank you so much
for agreeing to meet with me.

04:12.986 --> 04:16.523
My husband is
Raymond Littlefield.

04:16.557 --> 04:19.358
I don't know whether you
read the newspapers.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.896
He's been charged
with murdering my daughter.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.064
He didn't.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.733
Your daughter,
so his stepdaughter.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.535
Yes.

04:28.569 --> 04:31.404
Our attorney, who I consider
to be excellent--

04:31.437 --> 04:33.640
I'm convinced
he no longer believes

04:33.674 --> 04:35.341
in my husband's innocence,

04:35.375 --> 04:37.578
and neither Raymond
nor myself, for that matter,

04:37.611 --> 04:39.946
feel that it's wise
to go into a trial

04:39.980 --> 04:42.949
with a lawyer who's less
than sure of the cause.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.685
May I stop you?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.520
For the most part,
the lawyer's personal beliefs

04:46.553 --> 04:48.689
about his client's
guilt or innocence--

04:48.722 --> 04:49.923
it rarely matters much.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.025
You don't care?

04:52.058 --> 04:54.060
Not really.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.897
I guess for our own
peace of mind,

04:56.930 --> 04:59.600
we'd like
to walk into that room

04:59.633 --> 05:01.668
with a lawyer
who's truly with us.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.504
I'm also informed

05:03.537 --> 05:05.539
an attorney who believes
in his client's innocence

05:05.572 --> 05:08.074
usually puts more pressure
on himself.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.545
We'd like the benefit
of that pressure.

05:11.578 --> 05:15.115
Tell me about the case.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.918
I've read a little,
but...

05:17.951 --> 05:21.888
My daughter was bludgeoned
to death last October.

05:21.922 --> 05:26.560
Some of her blood was found
on one of Raymond's golf clubs.

05:26.593 --> 05:30.030
Is that the extent
of the evidence?

05:30.063 --> 05:33.634
That and...

05:33.667 --> 05:36.503
they claim he had
an affair with her.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.508
He didn't.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.946
Is it getting worse?

05:45.979 --> 05:50.416
It's not sharp, but...

05:50.450 --> 05:52.485
it's not going away,
either.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.555
Why don't we just go
to the doctor to be safe?

05:57.824 --> 05:59.059
Yeah.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.494
That's a good idea.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.529
Come on.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.673
HELEN: Amanda?

06:12.706 --> 06:16.109
How are you doing?

06:16.142 --> 06:18.679
I'm okay.

06:18.712 --> 06:22.683
You're looking
so much better.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.188
You know...

06:28.221 --> 06:31.124
we might need you to come
tell what happened in court.

06:31.157 --> 06:34.427
You said
I didn't have to.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.062
Well, that's
what we're hoping,

06:36.096 --> 06:37.964
and it's still possible
you might not have to.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.766
The man's
going to be there?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.435
Amanda,
you will be totally safe.

06:42.468 --> 06:46.072
There will be a lot of
policemen and court officers.

06:46.106 --> 06:50.043
What-- What if
nobody believes me?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.078
You don't have to
worry about that.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.080
Making them believe--
that's my job.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.618
You just have to
tell what happened.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.119
Can you do that?

07:02.923 --> 07:06.226
She's so fragile
right now.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.161
Is there any way
to get a continuance?

07:08.194 --> 07:09.796
I'm asking for one,

07:09.830 --> 07:12.533
but this judge is a nightmare
with his docket.

07:12.566 --> 07:15.068
I can't see him
giving us any more time.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.237
She's still
in bad shape, Helen.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.572
A week, a month--

07:18.605 --> 07:19.740
I'll try,

07:19.773 --> 07:21.708
but if she has to,
can she do it?

07:21.742 --> 07:26.647
The question is not so much
can she. It's should she.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.983
Sticking her in a room
with the man who raped her...

07:30.016 --> 07:32.553
she'll see him sitting there
in a nice suit,

07:32.586 --> 07:35.155
getting called "mister"
by these authority figures.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.758
Then she'll be attacked
by the defense lawyer.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.193
I understand.
Can she do it?

07:40.226 --> 07:42.729
Can she? Probably, yes,

07:42.763 --> 07:45.899
but try to get her
more time.

07:48.769 --> 07:52.205
All the evidence of the affair
came from my daughter.

07:52.238 --> 07:55.609
She told her friends this.
She told her sister.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.678
And you think
she was making it up?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.112
She was very troubled.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.882
She would say things
to get attention.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.216
Two years ago,

08:03.249 --> 08:06.052
when Raymond wouldn't
let her go to a party,

08:06.086 --> 08:09.122
she threatened to say
that he molested her.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.024
She was getting counseling.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.859
She was pathological,
Mr. Donnell.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.260
Okay, now,

08:14.294 --> 08:17.931
what about her blood
on your husband's golf club?

08:17.964 --> 08:20.133
We believe
the club was planted.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.035
By who?

08:22.068 --> 08:23.103
No idea.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.606
Raymond had some enemies
at work.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.274
Fiona, my daughter,
had enemies, too.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.144
She'd gotten
into some drug problems.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.615
Perhaps somebody
wanted to kill her,

08:34.648 --> 08:38.018
had knowledge of
this so-called "affair,"

08:38.051 --> 08:41.020
and then used it
to frame Raymond.

08:41.054 --> 08:45.325
Or perhaps somebody just
wanted to frame Raymond to...

08:45.358 --> 08:47.694
To what?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.630
Get even.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.331
Who would want
to do that?

08:51.364 --> 08:56.202
He was having an affair
with a woman,

08:56.236 --> 08:58.872
which ended last summer.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.340
Do you think
that this woman

09:00.373 --> 09:02.175
might have
killed your daughter?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.645
I don't even know her.

09:04.678 --> 09:08.915
Raymond thinks not.
The police think not.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.785
How old was your daughter?

09:11.818 --> 09:14.755
Sixteen.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.328
Is this where
you're getting the pains?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.130
Yeah, right there.
Mm-hmm.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.033
Could be just ligament strain
or muscle spasm.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.138
It could be pre-eclampsia.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.641
Your B. P.'s a little high.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.911
Well, the paternity suit
really stressed me out.

09:37.944 --> 09:41.181
There are also trace amounts
of protein in your urine.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.883
Oh, great.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.751
Ellenor, have you been
feeling sick lately?

09:44.785 --> 09:45.819
Had the flu, a cold?

09:45.852 --> 09:47.287
No. Why?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.923
You've got an elevated
white blood cell count,

09:49.956 --> 09:52.893
which is normal in pregnancy,
but you're high.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.928
I want to run
some more tests.

09:54.961 --> 09:55.962
Okay, now you're
freaking me out.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.098
Ellenor.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.834
I know you don't want Ben
because he's a personal friend,

10:00.867 --> 10:02.936
but I'd like
for him to see you.

10:04.971 --> 10:07.040
Is the baby in danger?

10:07.073 --> 10:08.308
Not at all,

10:08.341 --> 10:11.845
but I want Ben Gideon
to see you.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.920
All rise. The honorable
Abraham Betts presiding.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.788
Counsel, remain standing.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.790
No need
to get comfortable.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.827
This isn't
going to take very long.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.932
Ms. Gamble,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.967
your motion for a continuance
is denied.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.368
Your honor--

10:35.401 --> 10:37.971
I told you probable cause
on this is thin.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.873
The defendant
does have the right

10:39.906 --> 10:42.042
to a fair and speedy trial,
Ms. Gamble.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.309
Have you forgotten that?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.145
The rape wasn't
that long ago.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.780
The longer you wait,

10:46.813 --> 10:48.815
the less fresh the memories
of your witnesses.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.984
Yes, thank you
for your concern.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.886
You also have my motion

10:52.919 --> 10:55.989
to let the child testify
via closed-circuit television.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.157
Denied.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.326
This trial starts
after lunch.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.795
Your honor,

11:01.828 --> 11:03.730
I'd like to be heard
on my second motion.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.331
You've been read.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.833
The victim is 11.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.736
Forcing an 11-year-old
little girl to sit

11:09.770 --> 11:11.437
in the same room with
the man who raped her--

11:11.471 --> 11:13.740
That's his right.
Confrontation clause.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.809
Face-to-face confrontation
if she testifies.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.911
It doesn't need
to be in the courtroom.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.446
She could testify
closed-circuit.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.448
It's not done that way
in Massachusetts, your honor.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.751
-It could be.
-That's it, Ms. Gamble.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.186
You could save an 11-year-old
girl from needlessly suffering.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.288
That's enough!
The law is the law.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.823
Your motion is denied.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.892
This trial will start
in one hour.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.059
Get your witnesses.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.943
Why is he being
like that?

11:49.976 --> 11:52.378
Because he's a judge
who cares more about his docket

11:52.412 --> 11:55.048
than the emotions of an
11-year-old rape victim.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.783
So what now?

11:56.817 --> 11:59.219
Let's start the case,
see how it goes.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.221
Maybe I can
still get a plea.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.789
And if you can't?

12:05.526 --> 12:08.028
You gave me your word.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.965
Mr. McGowan,
let's just see how it goes.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.886
We found evidence
of vaginal penetration,

12:32.919 --> 12:34.521
lesions, and bruising.

12:34.555 --> 12:37.190
The hymen was broken.

12:37.223 --> 12:40.193
Doctor, were you able
to form a medical opinion

12:40.226 --> 12:41.461
as to what happened?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.530
Based on the examination,

12:43.564 --> 12:48.001
the injuries are consistent
with forcible penetration.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.936
Any evidence of semen?

12:49.970 --> 12:50.937
No.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.206
Any physical evidence,

12:53.239 --> 12:56.209
other than the injuries,
that suggests she was raped?

12:56.242 --> 12:57.811
No, but the injuries--

12:57.844 --> 12:58.945
Thank you, doctor.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.982
You've answered my questions.

13:07.588 --> 13:09.856
You're up next.
20 minutes.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.124
Oh, God.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.459
Just try to relax.
You say exactly what--

13:13.493 --> 13:17.130
Michelle, I smell beer.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.099
I had one. That's all.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.134
Oh, great.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.969
Ms. Gamble,
I was trembling.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.507
My hands were shaking.
Just to calm me. I'm fine.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.209
You need to be strong
up there.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.244
Okay.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.514
His lawyer is going
to come at you.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.315
Just remember,

13:35.348 --> 13:37.350
you're standing up there
for a young girl.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.588
You need to be
as strong as you can.

13:41.622 --> 13:45.626
Okay.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.360
BOBBY: I hate
to be plundering--

13:47.393 --> 13:49.129
Well, my wife's
been screaming at me

13:49.162 --> 13:50.496
to go on vacation
anyway.

13:50.531 --> 13:54.134
The files
are in good shape.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.970
Investigative reports--
you can use all my exhibits.

13:57.003 --> 14:00.073
I can have them
messengered over.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.611
What's the matter?

14:04.645 --> 14:07.280
Losing a high-profile case
a week before trial,

14:07.313 --> 14:09.916
one would think you'd be
a little more upset.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.352
There'll be
other cases, Bobby.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.522
He told you he did it.

14:15.556 --> 14:16.523
No, he didn't.

14:16.557 --> 14:19.025
-He did.
-Bobby--

14:19.059 --> 14:21.995
You can't put him on the stand
to say he didn't do it

14:22.028 --> 14:23.930
since you know the truth,

14:23.964 --> 14:26.933
so he needs a lawyer
who doesn't know the truth.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.369
That's what's going on here,
isn't it?

14:29.402 --> 14:31.104
-Bobby--
-You know too much.

14:31.137 --> 14:35.108
He has denied his guilt
at all times.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.444
Uh-huh.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.381
I looked out of my window
into the vacant lot

14:41.414 --> 14:44.651
and seen him on top of Amanda
with his pants down.

14:44.685 --> 14:47.320
She got away
and started to run,

14:47.353 --> 14:49.556
but he started
chasing her.

14:49.590 --> 14:51.925
HELEN: Who was the man?

14:51.958 --> 14:53.059
Him.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.395
Bruce Wilson.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.498
He lives in the Adams-Green
projects with us.

14:58.532 --> 15:01.067
He was running
after Amanda,

15:01.101 --> 15:04.671
and she was crying,
you know, "Leave me alone."

15:04.705 --> 15:06.540
What did you do?

15:06.573 --> 15:09.142
I ran down to help.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.411
I don't know her real well,
but I know her dad's crippled.

15:11.444 --> 15:15.081
I got downstairs,
Wilson was already gone.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.050
So I got Amanda
settled down.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.621
She was totally upset
and crying.

15:20.654 --> 15:24.958
Holding herself,
you know, down here.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.627
She said that--

15:26.660 --> 15:28.595
Objection-- hearsay.

15:28.629 --> 15:30.063
Excited utterance.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.698
Objection sustained.

15:31.732 --> 15:35.101
What did you do next?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.737
I took her to her dad,

15:36.770 --> 15:38.505
but he doesn't have a car,
so we took a bus

15:38.539 --> 15:40.373
to the emergency room
so she could see a doctor.

15:40.406 --> 15:44.545
And, Ms. Tritter,
had you been drinking that day?

15:44.578 --> 15:47.648
I drank two beers
that morning,

15:47.681 --> 15:49.550
but I wasn't drunk.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.285
I drink a lot.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.454
Two beers doesn't really
affect me that much.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.657
Are you sure
you saw what happened?

15:56.690 --> 15:59.259
Yes.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.062
You ran down when you saw
the girl being attacked?

16:02.095 --> 16:03.229
Yes.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.398
-Right away?
-That's right.

16:05.431 --> 16:08.368
So you saw the attacker
for what, half a second?

16:08.401 --> 16:11.237
No, I--

16:11.271 --> 16:12.573
A couple of seconds.

16:12.606 --> 16:14.374
I had to look
and figure out what was--

16:14.407 --> 16:17.143
You had to look
because the vacant lot--

16:17.177 --> 16:20.113
it's about 200 feet
from your house, right?

16:20.146 --> 16:22.215
I guess.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.584
And when you got there,
the man was gone?

16:23.617 --> 16:25.385
Yeah, he'd run away.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.653
From 200 feet,

16:26.687 --> 16:29.489
you watch for a whole
couple of seconds,

16:29.523 --> 16:32.659
but you're sure
that my client is the man?

16:32.693 --> 16:37.598
You're an alcoholic,
aren't you, Ms. Tritter?

16:37.631 --> 16:40.033
He did it.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.168
I saw him.

16:42.202 --> 16:45.471
You're an alcoholic,
aren't you, Ms. Tritter?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.610
Pretty much.

16:49.643 --> 16:51.778
Do you ever lie about
how much you've had to drink?

16:51.812 --> 16:53.680
Sometimes.

16:53.714 --> 16:56.349
Does your client ever lie
about raping children?

16:56.382 --> 16:58.785
-Move to strike.
-Sustained.

16:58.819 --> 17:01.622
You were drunk that day,
weren't you, Ms. Tritter?

17:01.655 --> 17:03.056
No.

17:03.089 --> 17:04.357
No? You have a car,
don't you?

17:04.390 --> 17:06.326
Yes.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.729
Didn't you tell
Mr. McGowan

17:08.762 --> 17:10.463
that you were
too drunk to drive?

17:10.496 --> 17:13.599
I didn't want to put
anybody at risk,

17:13.634 --> 17:15.502
but I saw what I saw.

17:15.536 --> 17:17.170
Had any alcohol today?

17:17.203 --> 17:20.173
One beer.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.808
Ever been convicted
of a crime?

17:21.842 --> 17:23.609
Once.

17:23.644 --> 17:24.711
What was the charge?

17:24.744 --> 17:26.747
Public drunkenness.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.816
You were found passed out
on a sidewalk.

17:29.850 --> 17:32.385
Am I correct?

17:32.418 --> 17:34.387
Yes.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.434
What have they told you?

17:48.468 --> 17:51.404
Just that I could have
some mysterious infection.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.439
Is he holding
anything back?

17:53.473 --> 17:56.476
He's an old friend, Eugene.
He's not going to lie to me.

17:56.510 --> 17:59.546
I might, if there was
money involved.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.548
-Benjamin Gideon.
-Eugene Young.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.749
Nice to meet you.

18:02.783 --> 18:04.217
All right,
cut the small talk.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.218
Just tell me.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.287
We still don't know.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.222
Did I tell you he was funny?

18:09.255 --> 18:12.225
The ultrasound is clean.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.160
No stones, ducts are clear.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.729
So, more tests?

18:15.762 --> 18:20.333
You might have something
called chorioamnionitis--

18:20.366 --> 18:22.836
an infection
of the amniotic fluid.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.671
I want to schedule
an amnio.

18:24.705 --> 18:27.407
Is it serious?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.409
Could be.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.613
Ben, just tell me, damn it.
Is it serious?

18:32.646 --> 18:35.549
Ellenor, I'm not hiding
anything from you.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.850
We just don't know.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.259
What was your relationship
with her?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.630
At first she hated me
because I wasn't her father.

18:49.663 --> 18:51.532
She called me "step-thing,"

18:51.565 --> 18:54.200
but then our relationship
improved.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.302
How old was she
when you two married?

18:56.336 --> 18:57.804
Thirteen.

18:57.838 --> 19:00.373
As I became
more of a father figure,

19:00.406 --> 19:02.643
we had run-ins
over discipline.

19:02.676 --> 19:06.580
It probably became a typical
father/daughter relationship.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.582
With the exception
that she claimed

19:08.615 --> 19:10.283
that you slept
with her.

19:10.316 --> 19:13.319
She had a history
of lying, Mr. Donnell.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.556
The more exotic,
the better.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.490
This one happened
to make her

19:17.524 --> 19:19.593
more interesting
to her friends.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.961
The bottom line is,

19:20.994 --> 19:22.863
there is just
no evidence of it

19:22.896 --> 19:25.566
other than Fiona going around
saying it happened.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.468
You said
she was getting counseling.

19:28.502 --> 19:29.603
Yes.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.705
Has anybody spoken
to this counselor?

19:31.738 --> 19:33.473
She told him
it happened.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.976
The prosecution plans
to call him as a witness.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.511
She lied to him, too.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.880
Okay.

19:39.913 --> 19:41.548
Tomorrow I'm going to bring
a motion in limine

19:41.582 --> 19:43.917
to suppress
your daughter's statements.

19:43.950 --> 19:44.918
If we win--

19:44.951 --> 19:46.753
-Can you?
-We have a shot.

19:46.787 --> 19:48.855
If we win, there's a chance
that the affair--

19:48.889 --> 19:51.291
The allegation
of that affair.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.927
Yes. There's a chance that
it'll never come into evidence.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.662
And if we lose?

19:55.696 --> 19:57.598
Our chances get worse.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.003
Now, I have to
ask one thing.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.840
I don't mean
to be offensive, but...

20:06.873 --> 20:10.844
What?

20:10.877 --> 20:15.381
Did the police ever
consider you a suspect?

20:23.957 --> 20:26.927
You're asking me
if I killed my own daughter.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.263
Since you had access to both
the victim and the weapon,

20:30.296 --> 20:32.465
I'm wondering
if the police ever asked.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.568
The night of the murder,

20:34.601 --> 20:38.404
I was at my daughter's school
at a board meeting.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.575
Now, whether or not
the police checked,

20:41.608 --> 20:43.644
you'll have to ask them.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.689
(door opens)

20:58.458 --> 21:00.627
Michelle.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.500
I'm sorry.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.670
Why?

21:09.703 --> 21:14.708
'Cause I'm a drunk...

21:14.741 --> 21:17.778
and I didn't do that girl
much good today.

21:17.811 --> 21:19.613
Yes, you did.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.281
No, I didn't.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.552
I saw the jury
looking at me.

21:25.586 --> 21:28.922
Michelle, you stuck
to what you saw,

21:28.955 --> 21:30.724
and you were
incredibly brave.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.827
Is Amanda going
to have to testify?

21:33.860 --> 21:37.463
I think
she may have to, yes.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.800
I'm so sorry.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.945
I can just feel it,
Lindsay. She did it.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.515
What's her motive
to kill her own daughter?

21:54.548 --> 21:56.116
I don't know yet.
Insurance,

21:56.149 --> 21:58.619
frame her husband,
I don't know. I'll find out.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.887
Bobby, don't you have
a slight conflict here?

22:00.921 --> 22:02.488
She's the one
who hired you.

22:02.523 --> 22:03.624
To defend him.

22:03.657 --> 22:05.391
He's the client,
not her.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.794
I'm not so sure.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.530
They both seem
to be the clients.

22:09.563 --> 22:10.764
If you're going
to undermine her,

22:10.797 --> 22:12.365
maybe you should get
outside ethics counsel

22:12.398 --> 22:13.700
to tell you what to do.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.940
HELEN: How does it feel?

22:19.973 --> 22:23.109
This is where you'll sit.

22:23.143 --> 22:26.479
Where's my dad
going to be?

22:26.513 --> 22:28.682
Right over here
the whole time.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.851
And I'll be here, too,
Amanda.

22:30.884 --> 22:33.854
I'm just going to ask you
a few easy questions

22:33.887 --> 22:36.790
just so you can get used to
talking up there, okay?

22:36.823 --> 22:39.492
Where is he going to be?

22:39.526 --> 22:40.493
Your father?

22:40.527 --> 22:42.696
No, no, him.

22:42.729 --> 22:46.499
I can't answer that.
I'm not allowed to.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.602
But he'll be
in the courtroom,

22:48.635 --> 22:50.771
and you never
have to look at him

22:50.804 --> 22:53.173
except when I ask you
to point to him.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.440
Can you do that?

23:02.916 --> 23:05.485
I can still call it off.

23:08.021 --> 23:09.690
Look, I won't lie.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.559
I think the guy
will do it again.

23:12.593 --> 23:15.095
I want him
off the streets.

23:15.128 --> 23:17.097
But, doctor,
if you're telling me

23:17.130 --> 23:18.732
it would be too detrimental
to Amanda--

23:18.765 --> 23:20.433
I think it's too soon.

23:20.466 --> 23:23.537
The thing is,
I can't afford to move.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.907
If he's not convicted,
he's back in the projects.

23:26.940 --> 23:30.110
He's back in our building.

23:30.143 --> 23:33.179
Doctor?

23:33.213 --> 23:35.849
I'm worried
about the trauma,

23:35.882 --> 23:39.853
but I'm also concerned
of the lasting effects--

23:39.886 --> 23:42.488
her feeling responsible
for his freedom

23:42.523 --> 23:45.125
should he rape again.

23:45.158 --> 23:48.128
I want to put her on.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.497
You have my word--

23:51.532 --> 23:55.168
if it gets too rough, I will
call this whole thing off.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.909
The statements
are all hearsay.

24:02.943 --> 24:05.646
The prosecution is trying
to introduce them as proof.

24:05.679 --> 24:07.080
I maintain
these would be exceptions

24:07.113 --> 24:09.215
-to the hearsay rule--
-How?

24:09.249 --> 24:11.652
If counsel took the time
to read our memorandum--

24:11.685 --> 24:13.186
I read it twice,
your honor.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.156
The victim boasted of this
affair with the defendant.

24:16.189 --> 24:18.725
There's no bragging exception
to the hearsay rule.

24:18.759 --> 24:20.260
HILLER: Hold on.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.262
Am I to understand
that the evidence

24:22.295 --> 24:24.798
of an affair between
the victim and the defendant--

24:24.831 --> 24:27.200
you have nothing independent
of the girl's claims?

24:27.233 --> 24:29.002
That's correct,
but if you look

24:29.035 --> 24:31.171
at the affidavit
from Fiona's therapist,

24:31.204 --> 24:33.273
you will see that
she was quite upset

24:33.306 --> 24:35.208
when she told him
of the affair.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.277
That would qualify
these statements

24:37.310 --> 24:40.080
as excited utterances,
and therefore exempt them--

24:40.113 --> 24:42.949
The affidavit says
the victim was emotional.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.651
It never says "excited."

24:44.685 --> 24:48.021
Who did the victim
make these claims to?

24:48.054 --> 24:50.123
To her sister,
several friends,

24:50.156 --> 24:51.758
and her therapist.

24:51.792 --> 24:54.761
And when she told
her sister and her friends,

24:54.795 --> 24:56.597
what was the tenor of it?

24:56.630 --> 25:00.701
She was essentially
boasting about it, yes.

25:02.636 --> 25:04.605
We drew a good judge
in Hiller.

25:04.638 --> 25:06.773
She goes by the law,
which gives us a shot,

25:06.807 --> 25:08.709
and she shouldn't
take long to rule.

25:08.742 --> 25:10.210
It is hearsay, right?

25:10.243 --> 25:11.778
Yes, but many times,

25:11.812 --> 25:13.680
judges find a way
to let this stuff in.

25:13.714 --> 25:15.616
In any event,
we have to prepare.

25:15.649 --> 25:17.217
Jenny, I'd like to talk
to you about your sister.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.720
-Can I do that?
-Okay.

25:19.753 --> 25:21.087
And I have some more things
to go over with you.

25:21.121 --> 25:22.589
Can you come by
after lunch?

25:22.623 --> 25:23.757
We'll be there.

25:23.790 --> 25:27.227
Come on.
Let's go see Daddy.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.863
Bobby...

25:29.896 --> 25:31.832
I just talked to Bec.

25:31.865 --> 25:34.568
According to the probate,
when Fiona died,

25:34.601 --> 25:37.203
Kate Littlefield became
the sole beneficiary

25:37.237 --> 25:39.205
of a $2 million
family trust.

25:39.239 --> 25:42.175
Gee, what a shock.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.110
Bobby,
if she's our target--

25:44.144 --> 25:46.947
she did sign
the retainer agreement.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.949
Technically, I think,
she is a client.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.951
We got to protect ourselves.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.122
Okay.

25:59.159 --> 26:02.095
We're ready.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.698
You can walk in
with me, Amanda.

26:04.731 --> 26:07.200
I'll hold your hand.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.604
Amanda?

26:13.907 --> 26:17.310
You just look at me
or the floor, nowhere else.

26:17.343 --> 26:21.214
Nobody's going to
hurt you in there.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.616
Let's go.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.122
Amanda?

27:05.125 --> 27:09.029
Ms. Gamble, are you
calling this witness?

27:12.799 --> 27:17.203
Amanda, you need to come up
to the witness chair.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.844
JUDGE BETTS: Ms. Gamble?

27:23.877 --> 27:26.079
HELEN: Amanda.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.818
JUDGE BETTS: Ms. Gamble?

27:33.887 --> 27:36.022
Your honor...

27:36.056 --> 27:38.959
the commonwealth rests.

27:38.992 --> 27:41.127
-Your honor--
-You're not calling
this witness?

27:41.161 --> 27:43.063
-No, your honor.
-Sidebar, your honor.

27:43.096 --> 27:44.698
Chambers.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.701
I should be allowed
to cross-examine.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.135
I did not call her.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.304
She just gave testimony
in that room.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.472
She did no such thing.

27:52.506 --> 27:53.874
She made an identification,

27:53.907 --> 27:54.975
and you know it, Helen.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.710
She looked at him,
stared.

27:56.743 --> 27:59.212
She did not take the stand.
I didn't call her.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.280
She needs an identification,

28:00.313 --> 28:01.715
so she waltzes
that girl in there

28:01.748 --> 28:03.784
to stare at my client
without being sworn.

28:03.817 --> 28:05.051
I didn't plan what was
going to happen--

28:05.085 --> 28:06.920
Oh, please.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.354
This cannot go to the jury.
I want a mistrial.

28:08.388 --> 28:10.356
Oh, right, then you'll argue
jeopardy has attached

28:10.390 --> 28:12.292
because we caused
a mistrial.

28:12.325 --> 28:14.828
What, so he can walk free
to rape another sixth grader?

28:14.861 --> 28:17.430
You don't want to be
responsible for that.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.499
Is that what this is,
Ms. Gamble?

28:19.533 --> 28:22.903
You couldn't make the case,
so you want me to take the heat

28:22.936 --> 28:25.071
for letting him
back on the streets?

28:25.105 --> 28:26.907
I'm not trying
to do that.

28:26.940 --> 28:29.175
If what just happened
in there was planned,

28:29.209 --> 28:31.778
then he's right--
you are totally unethical.

28:31.812 --> 28:34.247
And if you were surprised,
you are grossly incompetent,

28:34.280 --> 28:37.183
even for a government
lawyer.

28:37.217 --> 28:42.055
Either way, you're the one
to blame for a mistrial here.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.525
You, not me.

28:44.558 --> 28:47.093
We pushed that little girl
before she was ready.

28:47.127 --> 28:48.529
You, especially,
your honor.

28:48.562 --> 28:49.830
This is what happens.

28:49.863 --> 28:53.233
I say what happens here,
not you.

28:53.266 --> 28:54.801
Now get out.

29:04.511 --> 29:07.447
Did you believe
your sister at all?

29:07.480 --> 29:10.083
No. She liked
to shock people,

29:10.116 --> 29:12.218
and this had
a great shock value,

29:12.252 --> 29:14.454
sleeping with
her stepfather.

29:14.487 --> 29:17.223
All attention
would just turn to her.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.925
And you told this
to the police?

29:18.959 --> 29:20.961
Yes.

29:20.994 --> 29:23.564
Okay, your dad--
does he have a temper?

29:23.597 --> 29:24.565
Not really.

29:24.598 --> 29:26.299
I mean, he can get mad,

29:26.332 --> 29:29.369
but if you're asking
if he could have done this,

29:29.402 --> 29:31.938
the answer is no way.

29:31.972 --> 29:34.107
Okay, I have to ask.

29:34.140 --> 29:37.043
What about your mother?

29:37.077 --> 29:39.412
What about her?

29:39.445 --> 29:41.848
She had access

29:41.882 --> 29:44.217
to the victim
and the murder weapon.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.320
What was your mother's
relationship with Fiona?

29:47.353 --> 29:49.222
It was fine.

29:49.255 --> 29:53.159
Could you conceive of her
wanting to harm your sister?

29:53.193 --> 29:56.897
No.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.602
For me to help your dad,

30:01.635 --> 30:05.506
is there anything
you're not telling me?

30:05.539 --> 30:11.069
My mother loved my sister.
She would never hurt her.

30:19.152 --> 30:21.588
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

30:21.622 --> 30:23.489
Ms. Gamble's bringing
a witness into this room,

30:23.524 --> 30:26.459
then changing her mind
and deciding not to call her

30:26.492 --> 30:29.863
was one of the sorriest,
most reprehensible things

30:29.896 --> 30:32.465
I have ever seen on the bench.

30:32.498 --> 30:36.937
Ms. Gamble's arrogance
and stupidity

30:36.970 --> 30:40.040
should have been apparent to
everyone in this courtroom.

30:40.073 --> 30:45.378
Now, the defendant has moved
for a mistrial.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.884
That motion is denied.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.486
You are, however,
to give no consideration

30:53.520 --> 30:56.957
to the victim's behavior
in this room,

30:56.990 --> 31:01.161
not even her presence--
none.

31:01.194 --> 31:06.432
The evidence before you is only
the testimony of Ms. Tritter

31:06.466 --> 31:10.170
and the testimony
of Dr. Inwood--

31:10.203 --> 31:11.605
nothing else.

31:11.638 --> 31:14.541
We'll adjourn for 20 minutes,

31:14.575 --> 31:17.210
then, Mr. Pashman,
you'll begin your closing.

31:21.682 --> 31:23.349
There's no conflict
per se.

31:23.383 --> 31:24.918
Who you think did it
doesn't matter.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.386
You're simply trying
to establish

31:26.419 --> 31:27.988
that Raymond Littlefield
didn't.

31:28.021 --> 31:30.924
Rebecca, you know what
we're talking about.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.593
We might plan B the wife.

31:32.626 --> 31:36.062
She hired us, and I'm thinking
she's a client.

31:36.096 --> 31:38.364
And are you
going to do that?

31:38.398 --> 31:40.500
We don't know,
but it's an option. Can we?

31:40.534 --> 31:42.435
Well, here's where
it gets murky.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.505
If you tip her off that
you plan to go after her,

31:44.538 --> 31:46.540
then it undermines
the interest of Raymond.

31:46.573 --> 31:48.975
We know it's murky.
I want the answer.

31:49.009 --> 31:51.144
Don't snap at me.
I just got out of a coma.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.046
Look, we need
independent counsel

31:53.079 --> 31:54.548
to give us an opinion.

31:54.581 --> 31:57.150
In the meantime, if we win
on this hearsay issue,

31:57.183 --> 31:59.119
we won't need
to plan B anybody.

31:59.152 --> 32:00.687
So let's see
how that goes.

32:00.721 --> 32:02.422
What about Raymond's mistress?

32:02.455 --> 32:04.457
I'm meeting
with her today.

32:06.727 --> 32:08.428
BOBBY: How's she doing?

32:08.461 --> 32:10.496
Okay. She feels pretty good.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.332
What about emotionally?
How's she holding up?

32:12.365 --> 32:16.436
She's scared.

32:19.506 --> 32:22.743
All they have to identify
my client--

32:22.776 --> 32:27.313
all they have is the testimony
of an admitted alcoholic

32:27.347 --> 32:30.216
who says she saw it
for a couple of seconds

32:30.250 --> 32:33.520
from 200 feet away
while she was drinking.

32:33.554 --> 32:36.623
That's it.

32:36.657 --> 32:40.093
A two-second I.D.
from 200 feet away

32:40.126 --> 32:42.395
from a woman who was too drunk
to even drive at the time.

32:42.428 --> 32:46.166
Was there any physical evidence
linking this crime to my client?

32:46.199 --> 32:47.601
No.

32:47.634 --> 32:49.503
Any DNA? No.

32:49.536 --> 32:53.339
A hair? A fiber?

32:53.373 --> 32:55.341
Secretion of oil from a hand?

32:55.375 --> 32:58.579
A fingerprint? Nothing.

32:58.612 --> 33:02.783
The say-so of a drunk
at 200 feet--

33:02.816 --> 33:06.452
that's the prosecution's
entire case.

33:06.486 --> 33:11.091
Beyond reasonable doubt.

33:13.560 --> 33:18.098
Sometimes the strength
of a prosecution's case

33:18.131 --> 33:21.467
can't equal
the horror of a crime.

33:21.501 --> 33:24.337
An 11-year-old girl was raped.

33:24.370 --> 33:27.173
It would be nice to have DNA.

33:27.207 --> 33:28.609
Eleven years old.

33:28.642 --> 33:30.611
With the idea that a rapist

33:30.644 --> 33:33.747
could be put back out there
to rape more children,

33:33.780 --> 33:37.217
I'd love to have
more eyewitnesses than I do,

33:37.250 --> 33:39.385
but as it is often the case,

33:39.419 --> 33:42.488
when rapists abduct
11-year-old little girls

33:42.523 --> 33:44.625
and drag them off to rape them,

33:44.658 --> 33:46.627
they look for secluded areas

33:46.660 --> 33:49.630
where there's less chance
of being seen,

33:49.663 --> 33:52.432
and most rapists--
they're not seen.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.400
But this rapist was seen.

33:54.434 --> 33:58.204
Michelle Tritter told you
exactly what she saw,

33:58.238 --> 34:01.675
and her testimony
is uncontroverted.

34:01.708 --> 34:04.778
She bravely got up there

34:04.811 --> 34:07.581
under attack,
being called a drunk,

34:07.614 --> 34:11.585
and she bravely told you
what she saw.

34:11.618 --> 34:17.524
Now, the defense talked about
all the evidence we don't have.

34:17.558 --> 34:20.226
Why is that?

34:20.260 --> 34:22.763
It's because they know
what we do have--

34:22.795 --> 34:25.799
the medical evidence,
the eyewitness' evidence

34:25.831 --> 34:29.670
is more than enough
to convict.

34:29.703 --> 34:32.606
Ms. Tritter's not perfect.

34:32.639 --> 34:35.241
No eyewitness ever is.

34:35.275 --> 34:37.710
But if you believe her,

34:37.744 --> 34:41.782
then you know
what happened here.

34:41.815 --> 34:44.184
Bruce Wilson was doing

34:44.217 --> 34:48.420
exactly what Michelle Tritter
saw him doing.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.623
He was raping Amanda McGowan.

34:50.657 --> 34:52.425
Eleven years old.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.295
It's not a question of whether
we've proved it

34:55.328 --> 34:56.730
beyond reasonable doubt.

34:56.763 --> 35:02.468
We have proved it
beyond any doubt.

35:02.503 --> 35:05.706
The day his daughter was raped,

35:05.739 --> 35:07.307
Howard McGowan asked me

35:07.340 --> 35:10.577
if I would get the man
who did this.

35:10.611 --> 35:15.582
I told him
I couldn't really do that...

35:15.616 --> 35:18.418
but you can.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.759
Do you realize
my little girl

35:25.792 --> 35:27.327
is already bigger
than this guy?

35:27.360 --> 35:29.329
Then I'd go
straight C-section,

35:29.362 --> 35:31.331
that's all I can say.

35:31.364 --> 35:33.767
Oh, I'll take her
any way she comes.

35:33.800 --> 35:34.768
(baby coos)

35:34.801 --> 35:35.769
Yeah.

35:35.802 --> 35:37.337
(knock on door)

35:37.370 --> 35:39.840
I'll take him. Hey.

35:39.873 --> 35:42.208
She can stay.
Just tell me.

35:42.242 --> 35:44.578
Um, you really want
to know?

35:44.611 --> 35:46.580
You really want to live?
Tell me.

35:46.613 --> 35:50.250
Lab results are normal,
including the repeat CBC.

35:50.283 --> 35:51.451
Meaning?

35:51.484 --> 35:52.953
Meaning we need the bed,

35:52.986 --> 35:55.722
and you're starting
to bug me, so go home.

35:55.756 --> 35:57.824
-ELLENOR: Really?
-I'll give you the steroids
to take home.

35:57.858 --> 35:58.959
You can start tomorrow.

35:58.992 --> 36:01.261
I'm okay?
The baby's okay?

36:01.294 --> 36:03.830
Crisis averted.

36:03.864 --> 36:05.799
Oh, my God.

36:14.741 --> 36:16.577
BAILIFF: Be seated.

36:18.845 --> 36:21.915
I have reviewed
the prosecution's proffer,

36:21.948 --> 36:25.919
as well as the declaration
of the victim's therapist.

36:25.952 --> 36:28.855
The right to confront
one's accuser,

36:28.889 --> 36:32.859
the right to cross-examine
prosecutorial witnesses--

36:32.893 --> 36:37.964
these are fundamental principles
to our criminal justice system.

36:37.998 --> 36:39.833
The statements
made by the victim

36:39.866 --> 36:42.836
that she was having an affair
with the defendant--

36:42.869 --> 36:46.507
these are
out-of-court declarations,

36:46.540 --> 36:50.977
being offered for the truth
of those declarations.

36:51.011 --> 36:53.379
They constitute hearsay.

36:56.349 --> 36:57.784
They are inadmissible,

36:57.818 --> 37:00.987
and they will not be entered
into evidence

37:01.021 --> 37:03.624
for the purpose
of this proceeding.

37:03.657 --> 37:06.326
-We are adjourned.
-(gavel pounds)

37:06.359 --> 37:08.729
Well, congratulations.

37:08.762 --> 37:11.397
You now have
an excellent chance at freedom.

37:11.431 --> 37:12.999
What happens now?

37:13.033 --> 37:14.735
I expect the D. A. Will be
calling me to strike a deal.

37:14.768 --> 37:16.002
All they have now
for evidence

37:16.036 --> 37:18.672
is the victim's blood
on your golf club,

37:18.705 --> 37:20.774
and they can't make
reasonable doubt on that.

37:29.415 --> 37:32.886
Are you accusing me
of murder, Mr. Berluti?

37:32.919 --> 37:34.655
I'm doing no such thing.

37:34.688 --> 37:37.390
I'm just interviewing everybody
who could conceivably have

37:37.423 --> 37:39.459
a grudge against
Raymond Littlefield.

37:39.492 --> 37:41.361
You two were lovers.

37:41.394 --> 37:43.296
You broke up
three months before--

37:43.329 --> 37:45.666
If I were going to
kill somebody out of anger,

37:45.699 --> 37:47.467
wouldn't I have
chosen him?

37:47.500 --> 37:49.736
I'm not saying you
killed anybody. I'm just--

37:49.770 --> 37:53.006
You're looking for somebody
to point the finger at

37:53.039 --> 37:54.841
to create reasonable doubt.

37:54.875 --> 37:56.777
I'm a lawyer myself,
Mr. Berluti,

37:56.810 --> 37:58.478
and I'm more than familiar

37:58.512 --> 38:00.714
with the tactics employed
by your firm.

38:00.747 --> 38:02.883
You rise only slightly above
the kind of person

38:02.916 --> 38:05.485
who would kill a young girl
with a golf club.

38:05.519 --> 38:06.987
I don't appreciate that.

38:07.020 --> 38:10.824
And I don't appreciate being
set up as a plan B victim.

38:13.660 --> 38:15.862
Okay.

38:15.896 --> 38:18.765
As somebody who knows
Mr. Littlefield,

38:18.799 --> 38:21.067
do you think he's capable
of committing this crime?

38:21.101 --> 38:25.572
I think anybody's capable of
swinging a golf club

38:25.606 --> 38:27.608
in a fit of rage.

38:27.641 --> 38:29.510
Do I think he did?

38:29.543 --> 38:30.944
No.

38:30.977 --> 38:33.113
Who's your suspect, then?

38:33.146 --> 38:34.848
Have you looked
at his wife?

38:34.881 --> 38:38.752
You think she would kill
her own daughter?

38:38.785 --> 38:42.956
I think anybody's capable
of swinging a golf club

38:42.989 --> 38:44.825
in a fit of rage.

38:44.858 --> 38:47.561
Why did you
and Mr. Littlefield

38:47.594 --> 38:48.929
end your affair?

38:48.962 --> 38:52.032
His wife found out
about it.

39:11.885 --> 39:13.787
The defendant
will please rise.

39:17.691 --> 39:19.025
Mr. Foreman,

39:19.059 --> 39:23.496
the jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

39:23.530 --> 39:25.866
We have, your honor.

39:25.899 --> 39:27.534
What say you?

39:27.568 --> 39:29.536
Commonwealth vs. Bruce Wilson

39:29.570 --> 39:32.438
on the count of rape
of a child under 12.

39:32.472 --> 39:34.908
We find the defendant
Bruce Wilson...

39:37.477 --> 39:38.645
guilty.

39:40.681 --> 39:42.916
JUDGE: Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

39:42.949 --> 39:45.085
You're dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

39:45.118 --> 39:47.654
Security, please take
the defendant into custody.

39:47.688 --> 39:50.657
We'll see you on March the 20th
for sentencing,

39:50.691 --> 39:53.026
and we're adjourned.

40:01.568 --> 40:03.937
We'll need
a victim impact statement

40:03.970 --> 40:06.006
from you and Amanda.

40:06.039 --> 40:09.943
Ms. Gamble...

40:09.976 --> 40:12.846
Go see your daughter.

40:19.152 --> 40:21.588
(sighs)

40:24.725 --> 40:27.027
(knock on door)

40:27.060 --> 40:30.230
You look ready to dance.

40:30.263 --> 40:35.902
Actually, I am,
as blown away as I feel.

40:38.939 --> 40:40.473
What's up?

40:40.507 --> 40:42.475
Well, when I called you,

40:42.509 --> 40:45.145
I was prepared
to offer manslaughter.

40:45.178 --> 40:46.747
Then...

40:46.780 --> 40:48.014
What?

40:48.048 --> 40:51.652
DNA analysis
came up from Baltimore.

40:51.685 --> 40:53.620
There was some
contaminated blood

40:53.654 --> 40:56.557
on the victim
near the vagina.

40:56.590 --> 40:59.660
We've identified
the contaminant.

40:59.693 --> 41:01.762
It was a trace of semen.

41:01.795 --> 41:05.031
It genetically matches
your client.

41:11.705 --> 41:13.674
We're as shocked
as you.

41:13.707 --> 41:16.042
If you need more time
to prepare,

41:16.076 --> 41:18.712
we'll of course agree
to a continuance.

41:24.217 --> 41:25.686
Don't lie to me.

41:25.719 --> 41:27.854
It can't be right.

41:27.888 --> 41:30.023
It's pretty much a scientific
certainty, Raymond.

41:30.056 --> 41:31.792
They will now be able
to prove

41:31.825 --> 41:34.194
you were there
and you had sex with her.

41:34.227 --> 41:36.229
The game is over, Raymond.

41:36.262 --> 41:38.699
If I have any chance--
any chance at all

41:38.732 --> 41:40.867
of saving you
from a life sentence,

41:40.901 --> 41:43.169
you have to tell me
how that semen got there.

41:43.203 --> 41:44.671
I didn't kill her.

41:44.705 --> 41:46.239
How did that semen
get there, Raymond?

41:46.272 --> 41:47.808
(exhales)

41:52.312 --> 41:55.582
Aside from being sick,

41:55.616 --> 41:57.851
you're screwed.

42:00.220 --> 42:03.890
I didn't kill her,
Mr. Donnell.

42:05.759 --> 42:10.731
Whatever else might have
happened between us,

42:10.764 --> 42:12.533
I did not kill her.

42:21.942 --> 42:24.144
Oh, my God!

42:24.177 --> 42:26.279
And it took them till now
to identify it?

42:26.312 --> 42:27.848
Evidently,
it was contaminated.

42:27.881 --> 42:30.316
Now they're sure
it's his semen.

42:30.350 --> 42:32.052
Unbelievable.

42:32.085 --> 42:33.654
How old was
the stepdaughter?

42:33.687 --> 42:34.788
Sixteen.

42:34.821 --> 42:35.956
What a pig.

42:35.989 --> 42:37.924
Are you ready
for your soup?

42:37.958 --> 42:39.292
You have to eat now.

42:39.325 --> 42:41.695
Yes, but I have to go
to the bathroom first,

42:41.728 --> 42:42.929
and it needs more salt.

42:42.963 --> 42:44.330
How do you know?

42:44.364 --> 42:46.933
Because your soup
always does.

42:46.967 --> 42:49.302
And who makes soup
for breakfast, anyway?

42:49.335 --> 42:51.705
Get your own nurse,
one who can fry an egg.

42:51.738 --> 42:52.973
I can scramble eggs.

42:53.006 --> 42:54.808
Fantastic.
His own stepdaughter--

42:54.841 --> 42:56.342
You know, kids just aren't
innocent anymore, Jimmy.

42:56.376 --> 42:57.778
These days,
it's all about--

42:57.811 --> 42:58.812
(crash)

42:58.845 --> 42:59.946
Ellenor!

42:59.980 --> 43:04.718
Ellenor! Ellenor!
Oh, God. Ellenor.

43:04.751 --> 43:07.220
Ellenor? Oh, jeez.

43:07.253 --> 43:08.722
Oh. Oh, Ellenor.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.691
Yes, it's an emergency.

43:10.724 --> 43:13.093
We got a woman,
eight months pregnant,

43:13.126 --> 43:14.995
unconscious.

43:15.028 --> 43:16.897
-Is she breathing?
-Get an ambulance.

43:16.930 --> 43:18.965
JIMMY:
We need an ambulance now.

43:18.999 --> 43:22.202
466 Milbury Street,
apartment 11-B.

43:22.235 --> 43:23.336
Ellenor, please,
oh, please.

43:23.369 --> 43:24.938
Get it here now!

43:35.248 --> 43:38.251
â™ª (theme)

44:01.708 --> 44:02.776
You stinker!
