WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:01.999
The world is too small,

00:02.068 --> 00:03.797
our wisdom too limited,

00:03.870 --> 00:07.328
our time here too short
to waste any more of it

00:07.407 --> 00:10.342
in winning fleeting victories
at other people's expense.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.072
The Clinton Global initiative,

00:13.146 --> 00:14.875
which brings
philanthropists and CEOs

00:14.948 --> 00:17.508
together with non-profits
to make concrete commitments

00:17.584 --> 00:19.984
aimed at some of the world's
toughest problems.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.283
Almost 10 years in, they have
leveraged billions of dollars

00:22.355 --> 00:24.915
in assistance
in more than 180 countries.

00:24.991 --> 00:29.121
CGI was designed
to tackle big global challenges

00:29.195 --> 00:31.789
in bite-size pieces
with the conviction that

00:31.865 --> 00:35.266
regardless of size or scope,
our problems will yield

00:35.335 --> 00:38.463
to concerted action
and innovative partnerships

00:38.538 --> 00:42.838
of individuals, NGOs,
businesses, and governments.

00:42.909 --> 00:47.175
We have to now find a way
to triumph together.

00:47.247 --> 00:49.977
All the problems
that we face,

00:50.050 --> 00:52.951
from climate change
to financial contagion

00:53.019 --> 00:57.956
to nuclear proliferation, are
too complex and cross-cutting

00:58.024 --> 01:02.358
for any one government or indeed
for governments to solve alone.

01:02.429 --> 01:05.592
As we believe that ending hunger
is not only possible,

01:05.665 --> 01:08.964
but it is both a moral
and strategic imperative.

01:09.035 --> 01:12.436
Hillary Clinton is trying to shift
the spotlight to global warming.

01:12.505 --> 01:14.905
The presidential contender
unveiling her plans

01:14.974 --> 01:16.202
to combat climate change.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.573
Together with
innovative partners

01:17.644 --> 01:19.475
from the public
and private sectors,

01:19.546 --> 01:21.912
we're working to make homes,
universities, and cities

01:21.981 --> 01:23.243
more energy-efficient.

01:23.316 --> 01:26.285
We share
a common future

01:26.352 --> 01:30.345
and we are here
to find common ground.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.550
Women must be empowered.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.616
It's classic Bill Clinton.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.959
By using his birthday to help
the causes he champions,

01:38.031 --> 01:42.991
from combating climate change
to obesity and even HIV/aids.

01:43.069 --> 01:46.436
Help bring
new dignity and respect

01:46.506 --> 01:50.670
to women and girls
all over the world.

01:50.743 --> 01:54.907
And in so doing, bring
new strength and stability

01:54.981 --> 01:57.415
to families as well.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.008
We are trying
to do something

01:59.085 --> 02:01.815
no one has ever done before.

02:01.888 --> 02:05.187
A new report today claims
that the Clinton Foundation

02:05.258 --> 02:09.388
gives about 10% of
its money that it raises

02:09.461 --> 02:13.193
to actual charities and the
services that they offer.

02:13.266 --> 02:14.893
It has been
reported you've made

02:14.968 --> 02:16.833
5 million making speeches.

02:16.903 --> 02:20.805
The president's made
more than $100 million.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.274
Well, if, if you,

02:23.343 --> 02:24.640
you have no reason
to remember, but

02:24.711 --> 02:26.076
we came out of
the White House

02:26.146 --> 02:28.114
not only dead broke
but in debt.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.671
6 years ago,
Hillary Clinton was

02:29.749 --> 02:31.944
about to become
Secretary of State.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.485
Barack Obama had nominated her,

02:33.553 --> 02:36.021
everyone knew she was gonna be
confirmed by the Senate,

02:36.089 --> 02:37.716
gonna be confirmed easily.

02:37.790 --> 02:41.089
But there was a thought,
there was a question,

02:41.161 --> 02:43.220
there was a doubt out there

02:43.296 --> 02:45.491
about a potential
conflict of interest.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.897
The Clinton Foundation
dropping its self-imposed ban

02:47.967 --> 02:51.494
on collecting funds from
foreign governments and entities

02:51.571 --> 02:54.597
and now the "Washington Post"
reports total contributions

02:54.674 --> 02:58.166
to that foundation
amount to $2 billion.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.576
There's a lot of money
sloshing around,

03:00.647 --> 03:02.808
everything is blurred,
and it's not good.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.407
The questions
scream out at me.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.680
What in the world
happened with the foundation

03:07.754 --> 03:11.417
and these ulterior motives and
this money and the email server?

03:11.491 --> 03:13.823
I'm sorry.
Those scream out at me.

03:13.893 --> 03:17.761
The amount of schmoozing
involved and crossing lines

03:17.830 --> 03:20.890
and one person putting
money in a foundation

03:20.967 --> 03:23.527
and then Clinton
getting unbelievable amounts

03:23.603 --> 03:26.834
for his speeches, contracts
going one way or another.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.032
It's not good.

03:28.107 --> 03:31.406
I look forward
to working with all of you,

03:31.477 --> 03:33.604
particularly the appropriators.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.409
Uh, we have a lot of work to do

03:35.481 --> 03:38.473
and it is such important work
that lies ahead.

03:40.000 --> 03:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.518 --> 04:16.648
We did this with
a very simple strategy.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.354
Africa is
a continent that has been

04:55.428 --> 04:57.396
a chamber of horrors
for decades.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.709
It's really not the fault
of the African people.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.268
It's largely a result
of the kind of system

05:13.346 --> 05:15.280
that's been perpetuated there.

05:15.348 --> 05:18.806
You have these oligarchs,
which dominate these countries

05:18.885 --> 05:21.080
that oftentimes have
natural resources

05:21.154 --> 05:22.621
that can be very lucrative.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.680
And these oligarchs
strike deals

05:24.757 --> 05:27.783
with foreign corporations
or foreign governments,

05:27.860 --> 05:30.590
who in effect prop them up
and put them in power,

05:30.663 --> 05:33.860
and in exchange, these oligarchs
give these entities

05:33.933 --> 05:37.027
access to rich
mineral deposits.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.599
And the Clintons
you would expect to be

05:42.675 --> 05:44.006
opposed to this sort of thing,

05:44.077 --> 05:46.102
and that's at least
what their language does.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.945
Our countries have deepened
our cooperation on many issues

05:50.016 --> 05:53.816
including good governance
and transparency, energy,

05:53.886 --> 05:55.911
regional security,
and advancing

05:55.988 --> 05:58.684
peace and development
in the Niger Delta.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.749
The problem
is, their words

06:00.827 --> 06:02.818
are different
from their actions.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.412
But his critics
say that far from

06:23.483 --> 06:25.610
entrenching democracy
in Rwanda,

06:25.685 --> 06:29.519
he's actually eroding it
by silencing his opposition.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.859
Paul Kagame
has been praised by

06:37.930 --> 06:39.989
Bill Clinton and the
Clinton Foundation.

06:42.535 --> 06:44.196
But the fact of the matter
is Paul Kagame

06:44.270 --> 06:46.067
has a terrible
human rights record.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.902
He's accused of aiding
military operations

06:50.977 --> 06:53.707
in the neighboring
Democratic Republic of Congo...

06:53.780 --> 06:56.806
and that actually forced the
recruitment of child soldiers.

06:58.284 --> 07:01.879
The U.N. has identified him
as being involved in activities

07:01.954 --> 07:04.650
that entailed massive
human rights violations.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.890
Newer opposition parties
that have been formed

07:07.960 --> 07:11.157
in the last year or two
have, one by one,

07:11.230 --> 07:14.529
been silenced or otherwise
excluded from the race,

07:14.600 --> 07:17.034
and individuals,
not only politicians

07:17.103 --> 07:20.004
but even journalists,
for example, and other Rwandans

07:20.072 --> 07:22.267
who may have views different
from those of the government,

07:22.341 --> 07:25.071
have found themselves at the
receiving end of what has become

07:25.144 --> 07:27.669
quite a violent
campaign of intimidation.

07:29.916 --> 07:33.113
Well, Paul Kagame is
a friend of Bill Clinton's.

07:33.186 --> 07:38.920
I want to say
a special word of appreciation

07:38.991 --> 07:42.154
for the leadership
of president Kagame.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.527
I'm greatly humbled to receive

07:47.600 --> 07:51.593
this Clinton
Global Citizen award.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.572
He's actually
given awards by Bill Clinton

07:54.640 --> 07:56.938
for his conduct as
the leader of that country,

07:57.009 --> 08:01.070
and they regale him as
a great military leader.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.342
This is the sort
of legitimization

08:03.416 --> 08:06.715
that we don't want of these
kinds of dictators and leaders.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.310
That's the kind of
legitimization

08:08.387 --> 08:09.854
that the Clintons
have engaged in.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.787
And they've done it
in a way that creates

08:11.858 --> 08:15.851
commercial opportunities for
donors and friends and allies,

08:15.928 --> 08:17.793
who want to do business
in Africa.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.937
Business in Africa means you are
dealing with dictators who are

08:35.014 --> 08:37.948
gonna give you access
to, say, mineral rights,

08:38.017 --> 08:40.383
or oil drilling rights,
but you're going to

08:40.453 --> 08:41.613
have to pay them off.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.121
The Clintons partner
with foreign entities

08:44.190 --> 08:48.593
who want access to Africa, and
specifically mining companies

08:48.661 --> 08:51.391
or energy companies who
need to get concessions

08:51.464 --> 08:57.232
for access to oil or natural gas
or the rights to mine for gold.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.830
Those two make a powerful
alliance because these companies

09:00.907 --> 09:02.738
will give money
to the Clintons,

09:02.808 --> 09:05.470
either in the form of
speaking fees or in the form of

09:05.545 --> 09:07.479
donations to
the Clinton Foundation.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.105
And the Clintons
will then, in effect,

09:09.181 --> 09:12.776
do their bidding
before the halls of power

09:12.852 --> 09:15.047
and corridors of power
in Africa,

09:15.121 --> 09:17.919
and they will go to foreign
governments and encourage them

09:17.990 --> 09:20.220
to do business with
individuals who are

09:20.293 --> 09:21.920
putting money in their pocket.

09:21.994 --> 09:26.055
And this leads to some amazing
fits of behavior that, in a way,

09:26.132 --> 09:29.397
are just reminiscent of
19th-century colonialism.

09:29.468 --> 09:32.904
A perfect example of this
is ambassador Joe Wilson.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.634
Joe Wilson is a longtime
friend of the Clintons.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.505
In fact, he endorsed
Hillary Clinton

09:37.577 --> 09:39.943
in the 2008
presidential election.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.810
And it was also thought that he
might become a senior official

09:42.882 --> 09:45.043
in Hillary Clinton's
State Department.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.051
But the fact of the matter
is Joe Wilson was up to

09:47.119 --> 09:51.180
something far more nefarious
during Hillary Clinton's tenure

09:51.257 --> 09:53.088
as Secretary of State.

09:53.159 --> 09:56.993
In 2009, shortly after
she became Secretary of State,

09:57.063 --> 09:58.690
when Wilson was
the vice chairman

09:58.764 --> 10:00.823
of a company called
Jarch capital,

10:00.900 --> 10:02.663
they took out
a 50-year lease on

10:02.735 --> 10:06.034
400,000 hectares
in South Sudan.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.369
South Sudan was in
the middle of a civil war

10:08.441 --> 10:11.103
and this lease was actually
signed with warlords

10:11.177 --> 10:13.702
who were involved
in a civil war.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.371
These individuals
who are engaged in

10:15.448 --> 10:17.143
massive human rights
violations,

10:17.216 --> 10:19.844
including the massacre
of opponent tribes.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.410
And basically, what Joe Wilson
was engaged in

10:22.488 --> 10:25.980
was something called investing
in sovereignty changes.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.856
They were basically cutting
deals, lucrative deals,

10:28.928 --> 10:31.396
worth potentially hundreds of
millions of dollars

10:31.464 --> 10:32.761
with these warlords,

10:32.832 --> 10:34.663
and the expectation was simple,

10:34.734 --> 10:36.793
these warlords
would take power,

10:36.869 --> 10:39.133
then they would give them
access to these lands

10:39.205 --> 10:41.696
where they could make
huge amounts of money

10:41.774 --> 10:44.607
exploring for natural gas,
exploring for oil,

10:44.677 --> 10:45.905
and for mineral rights.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.211
Ambassador Joe Wilson
isn't the only

10:49.281 --> 10:51.249
Clinton friend
and foundation donor

10:51.317 --> 10:53.808
who was working in
war-torn countries.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.878
Swedish mining investor
Lukas Lundin has pledged

10:56.956 --> 10:59.925
$100 million to
the Clinton Foundation.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.017
He did that in 2007.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.426
And his most lucrative
mining operations

11:04.497 --> 11:05.759
are in the war-torn country of

11:05.831 --> 11:08.197
the Democratic Republic
of Congo.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.827
This is a country that perhaps
has the most horrific

11:10.903 --> 11:13.895
human rights situation
on the face of the earth.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.838
By the time Lukas Lundin made

11:15.908 --> 11:19.139
his $100 million pledge
to the Clinton Foundation,

11:19.211 --> 11:23.113
his Congo operation was making,
quote, staggering profits,

11:23.182 --> 11:26.743
end quote, according to
his own financial statements.

11:26.819 --> 11:30.277
His overall capitalization
was $20 billion.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.984
But for those profits
to remain staggering,

11:33.059 --> 11:37.291
U.S. policy under Hillary
Clinton had to remain unchanged.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.295
That's a problem.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.390
Hillary Clinton as
a Senator back in 2006

11:41.467 --> 11:44.459
supported something called
the Congo Relief Security

11:44.537 --> 11:46.164
and Democracy Promotion act.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.069
As the law's name implied,

11:48.140 --> 11:50.472
the goal was to bring
reform to Congo.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.171
That's not something that
Lukas Lundin would want.

11:53.245 --> 11:56.737
So, in 2009, when Hillary
became Secretary of State,

11:56.816 --> 11:59.376
she reversed course 180 degrees

11:59.452 --> 12:01.943
and went from supporting
reform in Congo

12:02.021 --> 12:04.046
to supporting the status quo,

12:04.123 --> 12:06.887
which is exactly what
Lukas Lundin would want,

12:06.959 --> 12:09.587
who of course had
committed $100 million

12:09.662 --> 12:11.289
to the Clinton Foundation.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.888
But Congo isn't the only
scandal-plagued country

12:13.966 --> 12:16.366
where Clinton benefactors
have made millions.

12:19.271 --> 12:21.705
Africa's most
populous nation,

12:21.774 --> 12:24.038
Nigeria, is full of promise.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.238
But fulfilling that promise
is sometimes a struggle.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.577
Plagued by corruption
and mismanagement,

12:29.648 --> 12:34.051
the resource-rich country has
a poverty rate of over 50%.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.917
Look at
a country like Nigeria,

12:35.988 --> 12:38.252
which is really
a cesspool of corruption.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.792
In fact, people will
say it is perhaps

12:40.860 --> 12:43.294
the most corrupt country
in the world.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.387
It's rich in natural resources.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.897
It produces a lot of oil.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.093
But that money never
trickles down to the people.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.728
It goes to the oligarchs
who run the country,

12:51.804 --> 12:54.773
who oftentimes take that money
and put it in

12:54.840 --> 12:57.240
Swiss bank accounts
in a way that, of course,

12:57.309 --> 12:59.675
the people of Nigeria
can never benefit from.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.339
And you see there's a federal
law in the United States

13:02.414 --> 13:05.747
which says, if foreign
governments that receive

13:05.818 --> 13:08.685
U.S. assistance
aren't transparent

13:08.754 --> 13:10.847
in how they spend that money,

13:10.923 --> 13:12.652
that they will not
be able to get U.S.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.693
foreign assistance anymore.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.250
It's about transparency.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.955
But there's a way
around that law,

13:18.030 --> 13:19.861
and you can get
a waiver from that law.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.526
How? By getting the U.S.
Secretary of State

13:22.601 --> 13:23.966
to grant you a waiver.

13:24.036 --> 13:28.063
Uh, we intend
to remain very supportive

13:28.140 --> 13:31.906
on your reform efforts, uh,
thank you for mentioning, uh,

13:31.977 --> 13:34.275
the work we did together
on the elections.

13:34.346 --> 13:39.340
We're also very supportive of,
uh, the, uh, anti-corruption,

13:39.418 --> 13:42.717
uh, reform efforts,
more transparency,

13:42.788 --> 13:47.816
and the work that you and your
team is also championing.

13:47.893 --> 13:51.158
Uh, because we really
believe that, uh,

13:51.230 --> 13:54.825
the future for, uh,
Nigeria is limitless.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.563
So, in the case
of Nigeria, they receive

13:58.637 --> 14:01.299
hundreds of millions of dollars
in U.S. foreign assistance.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.603
They've not made progress
in being more transparent,

14:03.676 --> 14:05.473
and of course,
they've gotten exemptions

14:05.544 --> 14:08.479
from Hillary Clinton while
she was Secretary of State.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.345
What's so curious about this is
what was happening commercially

14:11.417 --> 14:13.408
to the Clintons
while this was going on.

14:13.485 --> 14:16.784
Bill Clinton, for
the first time ever, gets paid

14:16.856 --> 14:18.881
highly lucrative speeches
in Nigeria,

14:18.958 --> 14:20.550
which had never
happened before.

14:20.626 --> 14:26.292
In fact, he gets paid to do two
speeches, for $700,000 apiece,

14:26.365 --> 14:30.131
by a businessman in Nigeria who
just happens to be close with

14:30.202 --> 14:31.760
the president of that country.

14:31.837 --> 14:35.034
Keep in mind, by the way,
that his normal speaking fee

14:35.137 --> 14:38.434
is less than $200,000 a speech,

14:38.544 --> 14:41.843
so, this was an enormous payday
for Bill Clinton.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.506
OK, now we will
begin the panel.

14:51.323 --> 14:55.020
One of the pinnacles
of power in that country

14:55.094 --> 14:58.188
is a gentleman named
Gilbert Chagoury.

14:58.264 --> 15:01.131
Gilbert Chagoury,
who has committed $1 billion

15:01.200 --> 15:02.690
to the Clinton
Global Initiative,

15:02.768 --> 15:06.534
is connected to another
individual in the Clinton orbit,

15:06.605 --> 15:10.405
that would be mark rich,
the billionaire who was on

15:10.476 --> 15:12.637
the FBI's 10 most wanted list

15:12.711 --> 15:15.236
that was suddenly
and surprisingly pardoned

15:15.314 --> 15:18.249
by Bill Clinton in 2001.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.809
Marc Rich, you might recall,
is somebody who was trading oil

15:21.887 --> 15:24.048
with the Ayatollah Khomeini
of Iran

15:24.123 --> 15:26.785
at the same time that
the Ayatollah was holding

15:26.859 --> 15:28.554
50 Americans hostage.

15:28.627 --> 15:32.154
He also had a long history
of busting U.N. sanctions

15:32.231 --> 15:35.394
by trading oil with the
apartheid regime in South Africa

15:35.467 --> 15:38.231
and a whole host of other
nefarious governments.

15:38.304 --> 15:41.398
Well, Gilbert Chagoury,
the high Clinton donor,

15:41.473 --> 15:44.067
was business partners
with Marc Rich.

15:44.143 --> 15:47.078
Together, they sopped up
oil assets in Nigeria

15:47.146 --> 15:48.579
and sold them on the oil market

15:48.647 --> 15:51.343
for the benefit of
a corrupt individual

15:51.417 --> 15:55.217
who was leading Nigeria at
the time, named General Abacha.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.278
Abacha smuggled
by some estimates

15:57.356 --> 16:00.257
$4 billion to $8 billion
out of the country,

16:00.326 --> 16:02.556
and put them in
European bank accounts.

16:02.628 --> 16:06.655
Gilbert Chagoury was indicted
and convicted in Europe

16:06.732 --> 16:08.563
for helping him to do that.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.400
He was charged for aiding and
abetting a criminal enterprise,

16:12.471 --> 16:14.439
and on money
laundering charges.

16:14.506 --> 16:17.100
And the suffering that
ends up being done here

16:17.176 --> 16:20.976
is by the people of Nigeria,
who see their leadership

16:21.046 --> 16:23.105
getting a pass from
the United States.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.377
The elites in those countries
are getting rich.

16:25.451 --> 16:28.284
The Clintons are getting rich,
and the money somehow never

16:28.354 --> 16:30.584
trickles down to
the people of Nigeria.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.887
Sadly, this theme of resources
not trickling down

16:33.959 --> 16:36.723
to those most in need
is a common one

16:36.795 --> 16:38.160
when it comes to the Clintons.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.535
As we told you at the start
of tonight's program,

16:50.609 --> 16:52.509
a major-magnitude
earthquake has hit

16:52.578 --> 16:54.569
the island of Haiti
in the Caribbean.

16:54.646 --> 16:57.308
The quake measured around
7 points on the Richter scale

16:57.383 --> 16:59.977
and its epicenter fell
just 10 miles

17:00.052 --> 17:01.986
from the capital,
Port-au-Prince.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.921
Haiti's ambassador to the U.S.
has described the event

17:04.990 --> 17:07.925
as a catastrophe
of major proportions.

17:07.992 --> 17:13.454
So far, we have no information
regarding the causalities.

17:13.531 --> 17:17.262
The world is coming to
an end...

17:19.605 --> 17:21.038
it was
a big earthquake.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.836
It last like
15 seconds, I think.

17:23.909 --> 17:27.470
Probably the most
devastating humanitarian crisis

17:27.546 --> 17:28.945
that Hillary Clinton
faced during

17:29.014 --> 17:30.845
her tenure at
the State Department

17:30.916 --> 17:33.043
was the tragic
earthquake in Haiti.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.482
It happened in January of 2010,

17:37.556 --> 17:40.081
and literally in
a matter of seconds,

17:40.159 --> 17:42.787
250,000 people were
estimated to have died,

17:42.861 --> 17:45.421
and a large portion of
the Haitian infrastructure

17:45.497 --> 17:47.488
and economy was just decimated.

17:51.036 --> 17:54.802
It was a crisis
on a massive scale.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.434
United States is
offering our full assistance

17:59.511 --> 18:01.877
to Haiti and to others
in the region.

18:01.947 --> 18:05.280
Uh, we will be providing
both civilian and military

18:05.350 --> 18:08.376
disaster relief
and humanitarian assistance

18:08.454 --> 18:11.582
and our prayers are with the
people who have suffered, uh,

18:11.657 --> 18:14.387
their families, uh,
and their loved ones.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.225
In the days and weeks
that followed the earthquake

18:19.298 --> 18:21.266
in January of 2010,

18:21.333 --> 18:25.030
Hillary Clinton made
visits to Haiti.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.299
And here is
the latest on Haiti:

18:27.372 --> 18:28.862
U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton

18:28.941 --> 18:31.910
arrived in Port-au-Prince
just about an hour ago.

18:31.977 --> 18:35.242
She is the highest-ranking U.S.
official in Haiti right now,

18:35.314 --> 18:36.941
since Tuesday's earthquake.

18:37.015 --> 18:40.007
She's meeting with Haitian
leaders and international officials

18:40.085 --> 18:43.577
to discuss the rescue
and relief effort.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.179
In fact,
on her first visit,

18:45.257 --> 18:47.350
which occurred days
after the earthquake,

18:47.426 --> 18:49.417
they literally had
to stop traffic

18:49.495 --> 18:53.124
going into the airport
at Port-au-Prince.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.859
There, of course,
were relief supplies

18:54.933 --> 18:57.800
that were being flown in,
but that traffic was stopped

18:57.870 --> 19:01.533
so the Secretary of State could
come and assess the damage.

19:01.607 --> 19:02.869
There is
a perception,

19:02.941 --> 19:05.603
there have been complaints
or reports of bottlenecks,

19:05.677 --> 19:08.271
that there is a lot
of aid coming in,

19:08.347 --> 19:09.473
but it's very hard
to get it out

19:09.548 --> 19:10.480
to the people
who need it.

19:10.549 --> 19:11.811
That's just not true.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.545
The aid is coming in.
We're getting it out.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.280
There's just not
enough of it yet.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.345
She flew in
with her political aides

19:17.422 --> 19:19.185
on a large federal airplane.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.623
She landed at the airport,

19:20.692 --> 19:22.557
she made a large
press conference,

19:22.628 --> 19:24.493
made statements
about her commitment

19:24.563 --> 19:26.121
to rebuilding this country,

19:26.198 --> 19:27.927
and then she was
soon whisked away,

19:28.000 --> 19:29.729
headed back to Washington, D.C.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.099
theirs is a city in ruins.

19:36.175 --> 19:40.669
A country which can do little
but wait for help to arrive.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.317
The international
community responded in the way

19:46.385 --> 19:47.784
that you would expect it to.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.048
That is, large amounts
of money were committed,

19:50.122 --> 19:51.987
up to $13 billion from

19:52.057 --> 19:54.958
international relief
organizations, and of course,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.689
you had the official role
of the State Department,

19:57.763 --> 20:00.231
which would be point on
U.S. taxpayer dollars

20:00.299 --> 20:03.200
going to Haiti
for the purposes of relief.

20:03.268 --> 20:06.396
I want to assure
the people of Haiti

20:06.471 --> 20:10.874
that the United States
is a friend,

20:10.943 --> 20:13.969
a partner, and a supporter.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.173
Hillary Clinton's
State Department would oversee

20:16.248 --> 20:19.649
the reconstruction effort with
Chief of Staff Cheryl mills

20:19.718 --> 20:21.481
responsible for
the allocation of

20:21.553 --> 20:24.681
U.S. tax dollars through USAID,

20:24.756 --> 20:26.815
and Bill Clinton,
already appointed

20:26.892 --> 20:29.656
special envoy to Haiti
for the United Nations,

20:29.728 --> 20:33.289
was named co-chair of the
interim Haiti recovery commission

20:33.365 --> 20:35.925
along with the former
Haitian prime minister.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.492
I hope that it will be rebuilt

20:38.570 --> 20:40.800
in a much stronger
and more sustainable way,

20:40.872 --> 20:43.102
and I think
the Haitians want that.

20:43.175 --> 20:46.633
So, this was clearly a Clinton
operation from the beginning.

20:46.712 --> 20:48.236
Now, the Haitians
had their own ideas

20:48.313 --> 20:50.873
about how best
to rebuild their country.

20:50.949 --> 20:52.314
They wanted new roads.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.851
They wanted buildings rebuilt.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.614
And that's what
you would expect.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.917
This is how you recover
from an earthquake.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.481
The problem is that the Clintons
had their own agenda...

21:00.559 --> 21:03.460
the interests of major donors,
who had a vested interest in

21:03.528 --> 21:05.257
spending that money in Haiti,

21:05.330 --> 21:06.820
in ways that
would benefit them.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.532
And so, you immediately
had this clash

21:10.602 --> 21:12.729
between the Haitians
and the Clintons.

21:12.804 --> 21:14.863
And Haitians complained
almost immediately

21:14.940 --> 21:17.807
that they were shut out of
the decision making process,

21:17.876 --> 21:20.777
that it was really Bill Clinton
and a few of his friends

21:20.846 --> 21:23.212
that were calling the shots
in the IHRC.

21:23.282 --> 21:27.218
And they made some monumentally
bad decisions that not only

21:27.286 --> 21:29.345
didn't benefit
the Haitian people,

21:29.421 --> 21:31.946
but ended up putting
money in the pockets of

21:32.024 --> 21:36.324
major Clinton donors who had
economic stakes in Haiti.

21:36.395 --> 21:41.094
We have been united
behind a single goal:

21:41.166 --> 21:44.897
making investments in
this country's people

21:44.970 --> 21:46.961
and your infrastructure.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.133
So, it's a classic
example of what some people call

21:50.208 --> 21:52.108
disaster capitalism.

21:52.177 --> 21:55.544
Disaster capitalism in that
a natural disaster

21:55.614 --> 21:58.481
creates opportunities for
rebuilding to take place,

21:58.550 --> 22:00.814
but also for self-enrichment
to take place.

22:00.886 --> 22:04.617
And if you look at the Clintons
and the promises that were made,

22:04.690 --> 22:06.487
and the results that
actually followed,

22:06.558 --> 22:10.050
it is a tragic story of
crony capitalism gone awry.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.007
The single largest
relief project

22:32.084 --> 22:35.076
that the United States
committed taxpayer dollars to,

22:35.153 --> 22:39.852
$124 million to be exact,
was a project called Caracol,

22:39.925 --> 22:41.517
a textile factory
that was built

22:41.593 --> 22:43.458
in the northern part
of the country,

22:43.528 --> 22:46.258
that was supposed to create
some 60,000 jobs

22:46.331 --> 22:49.823
and was supposed to create
tremendous economic growth.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.368
There's a problem here already.

22:51.436 --> 22:54.234
You see, the earthquake affected
the southern part of Haiti.

22:54.306 --> 22:57.332
The northern part of the country
was entirely unaffected.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.570
But who were
the beneficiaries of this?

22:59.644 --> 23:03.102
Companies like Gap, Target,
and Walmart, to name a few.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.808
The Caracol factory was built.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.351
It didn't create 60,000 jobs.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.785
It created barely 5,000 jobs,

23:09.855 --> 23:13.484
but the major American companies
who got textiles tariff-free,

23:13.558 --> 23:16.755
made at low wages,
benefited enormously.

23:16.828 --> 23:20.457
And the end effect on the
Haitians was very, very minimal.

23:25.036 --> 23:27.163
If you look at some of
the infrastructure projects

23:27.239 --> 23:28.900
that were undertaken,

23:28.974 --> 23:30.168
the Clintons had

23:30.242 --> 23:34.372
very grand plans to build
large tracts of homes,

23:34.446 --> 23:36.380
and there were
contractors that were

23:36.448 --> 23:37.938
selected for those projects.

23:38.016 --> 23:40.382
Sometimes the contractors
had experience,

23:40.452 --> 23:41.817
sometimes they did not.

23:44.089 --> 23:47.149
There's one company in Florida
that spent a million dollars

23:47.225 --> 23:48.886
getting equipment into Haiti.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.087
They had experience
in disaster relief,

23:51.163 --> 23:53.358
but according to the owners
of that company,

23:53.432 --> 23:56.492
they only made a small donation
to the Clinton Foundation.

23:56.568 --> 23:57.728
And guess what?

23:57.803 --> 23:59.896
They didn't get
any relief contracts.

23:59.971 --> 24:02.940
On the other hand,
the contractors who did win the awards

24:03.008 --> 24:05.135
were given the opportunity
to build homes,

24:05.210 --> 24:07.075
and in some instances
were supposed to build

24:07.145 --> 24:09.739
tens of thousands
of homes for Haitians.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.942
They ended up building
a fraction of that.

24:12.017 --> 24:14.747
For instance, new settlements
program was supposed to build

24:14.820 --> 24:18.415
15,000 homes for $53 million.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.651
Instead, it built 2,600 homes,

24:20.725 --> 24:22.886
less than a quarter
of the original estimate,

24:22.961 --> 24:27.295
for $90 million, or
$47 million over budget,

24:27.365 --> 24:28.525
and they got away with it.

24:33.038 --> 24:35.905
So, you had contracts going
to these relief organizations

24:35.974 --> 24:38.841
that were also involved with
the Clinton Global initiative,

24:38.910 --> 24:41.344
and you had this one
organization, Dalberg,

24:41.413 --> 24:44.473
that was supposed to do an
assessment for relocating people

24:44.549 --> 24:46.278
that suffered
from the earthquake.

24:46.351 --> 24:48.842
They determined that people
should be moved to a site

24:48.920 --> 24:51.946
that happened to be on a cliff
that was highly unstable.

24:52.023 --> 24:55.652
USAID's inspector general
reviewed Dalberg's recommendations

24:55.727 --> 24:58.127
and found them
basically unusable.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.164
One member of
the USAID shelter team

25:00.232 --> 25:02.666
was quoted by "rolling stone"
magazine as saying that

25:02.734 --> 25:05.567
the recommendations were
so bad, it looked like

25:05.637 --> 25:08.538
the team never even
got out of their SUVs.

25:08.607 --> 25:10.905
Another person said that
only one of the people

25:10.976 --> 25:14.241
that was sent to Haiti by
Dalberg actually spoke French.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.014
Telecom mogul
Denis O'Brien

25:17.082 --> 25:18.709
is one of the world's
richest people,

25:18.783 --> 25:21.752
and he's finding opportunities
in the poorest country

25:21.820 --> 25:23.378
in the western hemisphere.

25:23.455 --> 25:24.854
The Irish billionaire
is the largest

25:24.923 --> 25:27.983
private investor in Haiti
through his company, Digicel.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.493
And he is now leading
the Clinton Global initiative

25:30.562 --> 25:32.587
efforts down in Haiti.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.995
Probably no one
came out better

25:34.065 --> 25:35.896
in the Haitian
reconstruction effort

25:35.967 --> 25:38.868
than an Irish billionaire
named Denis O'Brien.

25:38.937 --> 25:41.235
He was a Clinton Foundation
donor, giving them

25:41.306 --> 25:43.672
between $5 and $10 million.

25:43.742 --> 25:46.506
He helped arrange speeches
for Bill Clinton, too.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.443
The interest
of the Obama administration,

25:48.513 --> 25:52.210
particularly former Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton, you know,

25:52.284 --> 25:55.151
all the different
things that have happened

25:55.220 --> 25:59.054
to help Haiti get up off the
floor have been led by the U.S.

25:59.124 --> 26:01.183
and he was the owner
of something called Digicel,

26:01.259 --> 26:04.558
which is a cell phone company,
at the time of the earthquake.

26:04.629 --> 26:05.994
As part of that relief effort,

26:06.064 --> 26:07.998
the State Department
run by Hillary Clinton

26:08.066 --> 26:11.126
wanted to fund a mobile
money transfer service

26:11.202 --> 26:13.636
that would allow Haitian
citizens to transfer and receive

26:13.705 --> 26:15.195
money on their phones.

26:15.273 --> 26:18.470
Well, Digicel applied to be the
recipient of that grant money.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.272
4 weeks after
their application,

26:20.345 --> 26:24.247
Digicel actually sponsored a
speech for Bill Clinton in Jamaica

26:24.316 --> 26:27.342
and they paid him $225,000.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.388
And as it turns out, within
4 months of that speech,

26:30.455 --> 26:34.084
Digicel would receive the first
installment of that grant money.

26:34.159 --> 26:35.820
The earthquake actually
has been great

26:35.894 --> 26:37.759
for Digicel and Denis O'Brien.

26:39.130 --> 26:43.089
More than 4 years since
a magnitude 7.0 earthquake

26:43.168 --> 26:45.932
devastated Haiti,
and outrage there is growing

26:46.004 --> 26:48.438
over the largely failed
reconstruction effort

26:48.506 --> 26:51.031
despite the hundreds of
millions of dollars in aid

26:51.109 --> 26:54.875
that has been collected,
and spent, by the IHRC...

26:54.946 --> 26:57.141
the interim Haiti
recovery commission.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.979
So, whether you're talking
about housing or cell phones,

27:00.051 --> 27:01.143
you see that
the people that are

27:01.219 --> 27:03.187
closest to the Clintons
have made out

27:03.254 --> 27:06.382
very well from
the Haitian earthquake.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.686
The rest of the country,

27:07.759 --> 27:11.217
the ordinary people
of Haiti, not so much.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.161
Haitian activists
stage a protest outside

27:13.231 --> 27:15.131
Hillary Clinton's
Manhattan office.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.259
The demonstrators claim billions
of dollars were stolen through

27:17.335 --> 27:18.597
the Haiti
reconstruction commission,

27:18.670 --> 27:20.194
headed by Bill Clinton.

27:20.271 --> 27:23.263
They also say Haiti was used as
a cover for foreign governments

27:23.341 --> 27:26.003
to funnel kickbacks of possibly
hundreds of millions of dollars

27:26.077 --> 27:27.840
through the Clinton Foundation.

27:27.912 --> 27:29.345
They say it was done
in exchange for favors

27:29.414 --> 27:32.247
that Hillary was doing for them
as Secretary of State.

27:32.317 --> 27:36.083
The tragedy is, we had an
opportunity to rebuild in a way

27:36.154 --> 27:38.952
that would give the people
of that country hope.

27:39.024 --> 27:43.358
Sadly, that opportunity was
squandered and what took place,

27:43.428 --> 27:44.986
rather than rebuilding Haiti,

27:45.063 --> 27:48.294
was the self-enrichment
by friends of the Clintons.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.027
For all of Bill Clinton's
talk about

27:50.101 --> 27:52.695
"building Haiti back better",
the fact remains that

27:52.771 --> 27:55.604
the most visible evidence of
Clinton's role in the recovery

27:55.674 --> 27:59.132
isn't the improvement of daily
life for everyday Haitians

27:59.210 --> 28:01.508
but the construction
of new luxury hotels

28:01.579 --> 28:04.446
just miles from the folks
who have been living in tarps

28:04.516 --> 28:08.316
USAID handed out immediately
after the earthquake.

28:08.386 --> 28:11.844
We are telling
the world of the crimes that

28:11.923 --> 28:15.188
Bill and Hillary Clinton
are responsible for in Haiti.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.425
Lost interest in
Haiti's recovery,

28:19.497 --> 28:21.522
the influence and connections
afforded to

28:21.599 --> 28:23.294
donors from
the Clinton Foundation

28:23.368 --> 28:26.303
appear to have been lessons
learned by others.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.168
So, how much did
connections to the Clintons

28:28.239 --> 28:30.173
matter when you're
talking about Haiti?

28:30.241 --> 28:32.334
Consider the case
of gold mining.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.173
The government of Haiti
had not granted

28:34.245 --> 28:37.305
a gold mining concession
in 50 years.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.148
They decided to do so during the
reconstruction of their country,

28:41.219 --> 28:44.484
which was being overseen
by Bill and Hillary Clinton.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.822
What company did they select
to get this gold mining permit?

28:48.893 --> 28:51.418
A company called VCS mining.

28:51.496 --> 28:54.954
VCS mining had very little
experience in gold mining.

28:55.033 --> 28:58.025
But what did they have?
They had connections.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.367
Shortly after they
got that concession,

29:00.438 --> 29:02.838
someone joined their
board of directors.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.205
It just happened
to be Tony Rodham,

29:05.276 --> 29:08.404
brother of
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

29:10.515 --> 29:12.244
It was a true disaster.

29:12.317 --> 29:15.047
A true disaster that
followed the earthquake

29:15.120 --> 29:16.781
which was the natural disaster.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.016
This was the man-made,
Clinton-caused

29:19.090 --> 29:22.253
disaster in relief that
led to the wasting of

29:22.327 --> 29:26.058
enormous sums of money,
the enrichment of elites

29:26.131 --> 29:27.621
that were friends
with the Clintons,

29:27.699 --> 29:30.361
and the Haitians were left in
a situation where their life

29:30.435 --> 29:33.029
was really not much
better than it was

29:33.104 --> 29:34.969
the day after
the earthquake happened.

29:55.326 --> 29:58.693
An ambitious pipeline is
firing off a war of opinions.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.596
Environmental activists
marched in Washington today

30:01.666 --> 30:06.797
to protest plans for
the Keystone XL Oil Pipeline.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.135
A $7 billion project
to transport

30:09.207 --> 30:12.301
800,000 barrels of
tar sands oil a day

30:12.377 --> 30:14.845
from Canada down
to the Gulf Coast.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.437
In Washington,
a showdown

30:16.514 --> 30:17.708
on the Senate floor today

30:17.782 --> 30:19.306
over the Keystone XL Pipeline.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.909
The vote to approve
the controversial pipe project

30:21.986 --> 30:24.079
has big political implications.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.283
The pipeline would create
20,000 jobs, but opponents say

30:27.358 --> 30:29.519
the environmental risk
is too great.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.390
One of the touchstones
of the climate change debate

30:33.464 --> 30:35.625
has been the Keystone
XL Pipeline.

30:35.700 --> 30:39.192
It's designed to carry oil from
Canada through the United States

30:39.270 --> 30:42.330
to refineries in Louisiana
and in Texas.

30:42.407 --> 30:44.807
The environmental movement
has wholeheartedly rejected

30:44.876 --> 30:46.343
this deal from the beginning

30:46.411 --> 30:48.402
because they believe that
it's gonna further contribute

30:48.479 --> 30:51.141
to the problems of
climate change.

30:51.216 --> 30:53.150
- One...
- we are the people,

30:53.218 --> 30:55.118
- two...
- you can't ignore us,

30:55.186 --> 30:57.552
three...

30:57.622 --> 31:00.352
now, you would think that
the Clintons would be opposed to

31:00.425 --> 31:04.156
the Keystone XL Pipeline deal
because of those concerns.

31:04.229 --> 31:08.256
And perhaps they might be,
except for one or two problems,

31:08.333 --> 31:12.064
or should I say one or two
million problems.

31:12.136 --> 31:14.570
You see, when Hillary Clinton
became Secretary of State

31:14.639 --> 31:17.972
in late 2008, there was
already an issue related to

31:18.042 --> 31:20.704
the Keystone XL Pipeline
sitting on her desk.

31:20.778 --> 31:22.040
She was going to have to sign

31:22.113 --> 31:24.638
an environmental and economic
impact statement,

31:24.716 --> 31:27.947
and decide whether the Keystone
XL Pipeline should go forward.

31:33.157 --> 31:35.022
At that precise time,

31:35.093 --> 31:37.027
Bill Clinton gets
a lucrative offer

31:37.095 --> 31:40.496
of nearly $2 million to give
10 speeches in Canada,

31:40.565 --> 31:42.760
for the first time ever,
from a company called

31:42.834 --> 31:44.927
TD Bank Investment Group.

31:45.003 --> 31:48.404
He gave the last speech
in may of 2011.

31:48.473 --> 31:51.203
3 months later, Hillary's
State Department releases

31:51.276 --> 31:54.006
an environmental impact
statement that was seen as

31:54.176 --> 31:56.946
largely supportive of the 
Keystone XL Pipeline

31:57.048 --> 31:59.414
in a way that was
massively controversial.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.213
Hillary Clinton,
in effect, was betraying

32:01.286 --> 32:04.187
the environmental movement
by green-lighting this deal,

32:04.255 --> 32:06.655
when she had in her hands
the power to kill this deal

32:06.724 --> 32:07.656
in its crib.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.386
It was shocking.

32:09.460 --> 32:13.328
Organizations like Greenpeace and
Friends of the Earth were stunned.

32:13.398 --> 32:15.127
They wanted an investigation.

32:15.199 --> 32:16.427
But everybody was mystified.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.196
Nobody could understand
why Hillary Clinton

32:18.269 --> 32:20.032
would sign off on this deal,

32:20.104 --> 32:22.595
particularly when she
had been in favor of

32:22.674 --> 32:25.643
dealing with climate change,
and her boss Barack Obama,

32:25.710 --> 32:29.976
by all indications, seemed to be
opposed to this deal as well.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.037
It's also a time for

32:31.115 --> 32:33.640
a new approach
to climate change.

32:33.718 --> 32:36.016
We know we've got to
deal with global warming.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.816
We're seeing the effects of it.

32:37.889 --> 32:41.416
We need to invest in clean
energy technology today so that

32:41.492 --> 32:46.088
we can create new high-paying
jobs to protect our environment,

32:46.164 --> 32:48.394
to grow our economy,
and to finally break

32:48.466 --> 32:50.491
our addiction to foreign oil.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.763
How did we go from
the Clintons being in favor of

32:52.837 --> 32:57.365
fighting climate change,
and dealing with fossil fuel dependence,

32:57.442 --> 33:00.900
to Hillary Clinton signing off
on the Keystone XL Pipeline?

33:00.979 --> 33:04.813
The evidence that we found was
that it was about the money.

33:04.882 --> 33:06.611
This was not
a philosophical change.

33:06.684 --> 33:09.585
This was not a new way of
thinking about global warming.

33:09.654 --> 33:13.784
This was a way of taking
$2 million in cash,

33:13.858 --> 33:17.624
to essentially buy a decision
by the Secretary of State.

33:17.695 --> 33:20.789
Why is the TD Bank Investment
Group so interesting?

33:20.865 --> 33:24.301
Because they just happen to be
one of the largest shareholders

33:24.369 --> 33:26.496
in the Keystone XL
Pipeline itself.

33:28.973 --> 33:31.874
When we looked at Bill Clinton's
pattern of giving speeches,

33:31.943 --> 33:35.208
we looked at who was paying him,
when they were paying him,

33:35.279 --> 33:37.645
and if they have ever
paid for a speech before.

33:37.715 --> 33:39.740
What's so stunning
is that TD Bank

33:39.817 --> 33:43.150
had never sponsored a speech
by Bill Clinton before

33:43.221 --> 33:45.587
and then suddenly in late 2008,

33:45.656 --> 33:47.248
when Hillary Clinton
has been announced

33:47.325 --> 33:48.690
to be the Secretary of State,

33:48.760 --> 33:51.194
and when sitting on her desk
is the matter of

33:51.262 --> 33:53.355
the Keystone XL Pipeline,

33:53.431 --> 33:56.525
they suddenly decide
to sponsor these speeches.

33:56.601 --> 33:59.399
And when people realize that
the Clintons had pocketed

33:59.470 --> 34:02.371
about $2 million
at the precise time

34:02.440 --> 34:04.374
Hillary Clinton was
making this decision,

34:04.442 --> 34:06.672
it all now suddenly made sense.

34:06.744 --> 34:10.646
Because as we've seen repeated
over and over and over again,

34:10.715 --> 34:14.242
when it comes to the Clintons,
you have to follow the money.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.478
And in the case of
the Keystone XL Pipeline,

34:16.554 --> 34:18.715
they seem to have
abandoned their principles,

34:18.790 --> 34:23.193
their commitment as it was
to combating global warming,

34:23.261 --> 34:25.661
and dealing with our
dependence on fossil fuels.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.858
They jettisoned that
when $2 million showed up

34:28.933 --> 34:32.596
and suddenly came out in favor
of the Keystone XL Pipeline.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.728
When you see this sort of
pattern of behavior,

34:34.806 --> 34:37.331
you can't come to
any other conclusion,

34:37.408 --> 34:39.501
that it's a system
of pay-to-play.

34:39.577 --> 34:42.011
And again...other entities
appear to have

34:42.080 --> 34:44.275
picked up on this
business model, too.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.908
Well, Bill Clinton has been
paid enormous sums of money

34:46.984 --> 34:48.542
over the years
to give speeches.

34:48.619 --> 34:52.385
On average, he gets a little
less than $200,000 per speech.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.085
But something happened
in late 2008.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.252
His speaking fees skyrocketed

34:57.328 --> 34:59.421
after being out of
office for years.

34:59.497 --> 35:02.625
The reason was his wife
had become Secretary of State.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.600
In fact, 11 of the 13 speeches

35:04.669 --> 35:06.330
for which Bill Clinton
has been paid

35:06.404 --> 35:09.532
half a million dollars or more
occurred precisely when

35:09.607 --> 35:12.405
Hillary was the most powerful
diplomat in the world.

35:20.718 --> 35:24.745
You will never contribute
to an organization

35:24.822 --> 35:28.815
that will give you a higher
probability of having

35:28.893 --> 35:32.488
your good intentions turn into
real, positive changes

35:32.563 --> 35:35.031
in other people's lives.

35:35.099 --> 35:36.327
That will give you
a better chance

35:36.400 --> 35:38.061
than what you've
done here tonight.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.331
His single
biggest speech payday

35:40.404 --> 35:43.498
came from the Swedish
telecom company Ericsson,

35:43.574 --> 35:47.567
and it's a very, very unusual
and troubling story.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.011
Now, Ericsson is
a Swedish telecom company

35:50.081 --> 35:52.948
that in 2009 and 2010
was in trouble

35:53.017 --> 35:54.985
with Hillary Clinton's
State Department.

35:55.052 --> 35:57.646
Because Ericsson was selling
a lot of telecom equipment

35:57.722 --> 36:01.317
to Iran, to Belarus, and to
other oppressive governments,

36:01.392 --> 36:04.452
about which the State Department
was concerned.

36:04.529 --> 36:06.997
Ericsson risked being put on a
list by the federal government

36:07.064 --> 36:10.033
in the United States for
trading with an enemy state.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.934
There was actually an effort
being put forward in Washington

36:13.004 --> 36:16.838
to broaden Iranian sanctions to
include the very technologies

36:16.908 --> 36:20.173
that Ericsson was selling
to the Iranian government.

36:20.244 --> 36:23.805
So, it's against this background
that Ericsson decided

36:23.881 --> 36:28.443
now might be a good time to hire
Bill Clinton to give a speech.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.181
They had never paid for
a speech by him before

36:31.255 --> 36:33.052
and they decided to go in big:

36:33.124 --> 36:36.560
$750,000 for a single speech.

36:36.627 --> 36:38.822
7 days after
he gave that speech,

36:38.896 --> 36:42.457
Hillary's State Department came
out with a statement which said,

36:42.533 --> 36:44.626
we are not going to broaden
sanctions on Iran

36:44.702 --> 36:46.761
to include technologies
like telecom.

36:46.837 --> 36:49.931
We are going to rely and expect
companies like Ericsson

36:50.007 --> 36:51.474
to police themselves.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.204
It was a massive
win for Ericsson.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.338
Ericsson was able to avoid
having to deal with

36:57.415 --> 36:59.576
a regulatory battle
in Washington,

36:59.650 --> 37:01.277
giving up contracts that were

37:01.352 --> 37:03.217
highly lucrative
in these countries,

37:03.287 --> 37:05.653
and being put on
a list that would create

37:05.723 --> 37:07.987
enormous diplomatic
problems for them,

37:08.059 --> 37:10.493
all because essentially,
they paid Bill Clinton

37:10.561 --> 37:13.587
to give a speech for $750,000.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.359
Will you continue
to give speeches?

37:15.433 --> 37:17.924
Oh, yeah.
I gotta pay our bills.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.247
So, the question is, why
do we see the Clintons reversing

37:33.317 --> 37:37.617
decades of policy positions
that they've held so closely

37:37.688 --> 37:40.623
on issues like human rights
and environment?

37:40.691 --> 37:42.249
And a big clue comes
from folks that are

37:42.326 --> 37:44.385
giving the Clinton
Foundation literally

37:44.462 --> 37:45.952
tens of millions of dollars.

37:46.030 --> 37:48.726
And one, if not the biggest
donor to the foundation,

37:48.799 --> 37:51.199
is a Canadian named
Frank Giustra.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.032
Giustra is in
the mining business...

37:53.104 --> 37:55.732
hardly something you'd call
environmentally friendly...

37:55.806 --> 37:57.831
and he has interests
all over the world.

37:57.908 --> 37:59.773
And he uses his relationship
with the Clintons

37:59.844 --> 38:02.176
to benefit those interests
regardless of

38:02.246 --> 38:03.713
the environmental concerns.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.477
A great example of this is
what happened in Colombia.

38:08.819 --> 38:10.787
What's so interesting
about the relationship that

38:10.855 --> 38:12.618
the Clintons have
with Frank Giustra

38:12.690 --> 38:15.454
is they tend to show up in
these foreign countries together

38:15.526 --> 38:16.993
at the same time.

38:17.061 --> 38:19.529
Frank Giustra's made billions
of dollars over the years

38:19.597 --> 38:21.861
in the so-called penny
stock market in Canada,

38:21.932 --> 38:24.298
which is highly open
to manipulation.

38:24.368 --> 38:26.768
He's been very successful
in this area.

38:26.837 --> 38:28.805
Now, the Vancouver stock
exchange is not like

38:28.873 --> 38:31.341
the New York stock exchange
in the United States.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.707
This is a stock market
or an exchange

38:33.778 --> 38:35.746
that is dominated
by penny stocks.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.145
Made up of a lot of
natural resources stocks,

38:38.215 --> 38:41.116
it's sort of the wild,
wild west of investing.

38:41.185 --> 38:44.643
It's called dodge city
sometimes, and the reason is

38:44.722 --> 38:46.553
because there's
a lot of speculators,

38:46.624 --> 38:48.785
there's a lot of misinformation
that's put around,

38:48.859 --> 38:50.793
and there are a lot
of mining companies

38:50.861 --> 38:52.590
that don't really
have any assets,

38:52.663 --> 38:54.631
but will proclaim to have
gotten the rights

38:54.699 --> 38:56.963
to some lucrative gold mine,
let's say,

38:57.034 --> 38:59.969
and then they send that news out
to the public in the hope that

39:00.037 --> 39:03.006
it will lead to a flood of
people buying the penny stock,

39:03.074 --> 39:05.668
so the shareholders
can sell their assets.

39:13.050 --> 39:17.384
So, in June of 2010,
Bill Clinton and Frank Giustra

39:17.455 --> 39:20.015
fly to Bogota, Colombia.

39:20.091 --> 39:23.424
And who arrives there
at roughly the same time?

39:23.494 --> 39:25.985
Secretary of state
Hillary Clinton.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.894
The big thing from
the news conference was,

39:27.965 --> 39:30.024
where Bill and Hillary
were dining

39:30.101 --> 39:31.432
the other night in Bogota.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.868
Uh, I had a chance to talk to
her about her dinner experience

39:33.938 --> 39:36.429
in the Zona Rosa and here's
what she had to say.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.565
Dinner was good?

39:37.641 --> 39:39.541
It was excellent
in every way.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.577
So, it was like
eating in the states

39:40.644 --> 39:42.009
but eating in Bogota?

39:42.079 --> 39:47.210
Well, uh... it was
a real treat to be in Bogota

39:47.284 --> 39:50.651
and, uh, to be with people
who love this city so much,

39:50.721 --> 39:52.154
including my husband.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.783
Now, in her memoirs,
Hillary Clinton says that

39:54.859 --> 39:57.054
this is just
a happy coincidence,

39:57.128 --> 39:58.652
but when you see what follows,

39:58.729 --> 40:01.323
you realize that
this is no coincidence.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.027
The following morning, Bill
Clinton has a breakfast meeting

40:04.101 --> 40:08.037
with the outgoing president
of Colombia, president Uribe.

40:08.105 --> 40:11.302
Then, like a tag team, Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton

40:11.375 --> 40:13.639
has a noon
lunch meeting with him,

40:13.711 --> 40:15.440
and she grants him
several favors,

40:15.513 --> 40:16.912
including technical agreements

40:16.981 --> 40:19.074
that the Colombian
government wants.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.846
In the days that follow,
something dramatic happens.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.183
Frank Giustra has 3 companies

40:24.255 --> 40:27.190
that get major concessions
from the Colombian government.

40:27.258 --> 40:31.888
Pacific Rubiales, Petroamerica,
and Prima Colombia properties.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.987
One of those,
Prima Colombia properties,

40:34.064 --> 40:37.465
gets a concession to cut timber
in a rain forest in Colombia

40:37.535 --> 40:39.765
along the Pacific Coast.

40:39.837 --> 40:43.068
And that timber is not intended
to export to the United States,

40:43.140 --> 40:45.836
but is intended
for export to china.

40:49.213 --> 40:52.546
There is an outrage
and upset environmentalists

40:52.616 --> 40:54.413
who realize what's going on,

40:54.485 --> 40:56.510
and eventually
that permit is yanked

40:56.587 --> 40:58.418
by a future president
of Colombia,

40:58.489 --> 41:02.357
but not before Frank Giustra's
company is able to profit

41:02.426 --> 41:05.224
from cutting down
these rain forests.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.821
Which again is a behavior
that runs so contrary

41:07.898 --> 41:10.492
to what the Clintons
profess to be in favor of.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.035
We all know that
in order to build

41:12.102 --> 41:14.297
low-carbon economies
for the future,

41:14.371 --> 41:16.635
we need sustainable forests.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.607
I also know
the future of our planet

41:18.676 --> 41:21.270
depends on healthy,
standing forests.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.905
They have talked about
the problems of deforestation.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.778
They've talked about
the problems of...

41:25.850 --> 41:28.683
the need for successful
growing forests

41:28.752 --> 41:31.687
to mitigate carbon dioxide
in the air.

41:31.755 --> 41:34.747
And yet when this commercial
opportunity was presented

41:34.825 --> 41:36.690
to a major donor of theirs,

41:36.760 --> 41:39.627
they seemed to be very much
supportive of that,

41:39.697 --> 41:42.791
and in fact helped to get him
those concessions.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.892
He deserves
the credit for this.

41:44.969 --> 41:46.664
This was his idea,
not mine,

41:46.737 --> 41:48.796
and he raised
the money.

41:48.873 --> 41:51.899
And it's an astonishing
achievement.

41:51.976 --> 41:54.069
My job is to make sure
that it's not in vain.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.977
That he gets the return
on his investment,

41:57.047 --> 41:58.947
and his compassion,
and his commitment.

41:59.016 --> 41:59.948
The Clintons
appear to have

42:00.017 --> 42:01.644
changed their stance on issues

42:01.719 --> 42:04.153
even more significant
than the environment

42:04.221 --> 42:05.518
in ways that benefit those

42:05.589 --> 42:07.250
who have put money
in their pockets.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.152
I represent
a president and a country

42:37.221 --> 42:42.181
committed to a vision of
a world without nuclear weapons,

42:42.259 --> 42:46.286
and to taking the concrete
steps necessary

42:46.363 --> 42:48.160
that will help us get there.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.133
The Indian nuclear deal,
I think, is so troubling because

42:51.201 --> 42:54.398
this is a core
national security issue.

42:54.471 --> 42:57.372
One of the signature
achievements in foreign policy

42:57.451 --> 43:01.392
for Bill Clinton was
pushing the test-ban treaty

43:01.545 --> 43:03.206
and the non-proliferation
treaty.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.474
Today in New York,

43:04.548 --> 43:08.348
the United Nations General
Assembly voted overwhelmingly

43:08.419 --> 43:12.014
to adopt a comprehensive
nuclear test-ban treaty

43:12.089 --> 43:15.081
and open it for signature
later this month.

43:15.159 --> 43:17.184
The N.P.T. has been
sort of the holy grail

43:17.261 --> 43:19.456
when it comes to
nuclear disarmament.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.691
Something that the Clintons
had been supportive of,

43:21.765 --> 43:23.790
not just for years
but for decades.

43:25.135 --> 43:28.070
That was all
thrown asunder in 1998,

43:28.138 --> 43:30.368
when the Indian
government tested

43:30.441 --> 43:32.238
nuclear weapons underground.

43:32.309 --> 43:34.971
India's action threatens
the stability of Asia

43:35.045 --> 43:38.344
and challenges the firm
international consensus

43:38.415 --> 43:40.383
to stop all nuclear testing.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.648
These were tests
that truly shocked the world.

43:44.722 --> 43:47.020
Even the CIA was not aware that

43:47.091 --> 43:49.082
these tests were
about to take place.

43:49.159 --> 43:51.957
Clinton's reaction
was volcanic.

43:52.029 --> 43:54.224
He felt betrayed by
the Indian government.

43:54.298 --> 43:58.200
And as a result, he imposed
sanctions on India,

43:58.268 --> 44:00.395
essentially saying,
you're not going to get access

44:00.471 --> 44:04.931
to U.S. nuclear technology
until you sign the N.P.T.,

44:05.009 --> 44:06.738
the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

44:09.013 --> 44:11.504
In 2005, the Indian government

44:11.582 --> 44:13.982
wanted to get these
sanctions lifted.

44:14.051 --> 44:15.348
Not only do they
have an interest

44:15.419 --> 44:18.115
in expanding their
civilian nuclear base,

44:18.188 --> 44:19.314
they live in
a neighborhood where

44:19.390 --> 44:21.585
some pretty tough
customers and rivals

44:21.659 --> 44:23.593
have nuclear
weapons themselves.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.458
First of all,
you've got Pakistan,

44:25.529 --> 44:26.860
which is right next door,

44:26.930 --> 44:29.330
which is widely believed
to have nuclear weapons,

44:29.400 --> 44:32.335
and then you have China,
a longtime rival of India,

44:32.403 --> 44:34.303
which has a nuclear arsenal.

44:34.371 --> 44:36.236
The Clintons said that
they were in favor of

44:36.306 --> 44:39.002
giving the Indian government
some access,

44:39.076 --> 44:40.304
but the problem is it didn't go

44:40.377 --> 44:43.710
nearly as far as
the Indian government wanted.

44:43.781 --> 44:46.306
So, in 2005,
they started making

44:46.383 --> 44:48.783
donations to
the Clinton Foundation.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.148
This morning,
yet another shady donation

44:53.223 --> 44:55.088
to the Clinton Foundation
has surfaced,

44:55.159 --> 44:58.754
this time tied to
a donor from India,

44:58.829 --> 45:00.524
apparently a friend
of Bill Clinton.

45:00.597 --> 45:03.065
We're talking about
tens of millions of dollars

45:06.303 --> 45:08.965
and we're talking about
at least hundreds of thousands

45:09.039 --> 45:10.939
if not millions of dollars
in speeches

45:11.008 --> 45:12.873
that Bill Clinton was paid,

45:12.943 --> 45:15.969
by interested parties
in the Indian nuclear deal.

45:18.082 --> 45:21.142
Amar Singh, according to Clinton
disclosures, has given between

45:21.218 --> 45:24.119
$1 million and $5 million
to the Clinton Foundation

45:24.188 --> 45:25.780
in the push
to get them to support

45:25.856 --> 45:29.019
Indian access
to nuclear technology.

45:29.093 --> 45:31.186
He's a member of parliament
who has gotten in

45:31.261 --> 45:33.286
fistfights on the floor
of the parliament,

45:33.363 --> 45:36.696
who's been charged with
bribing members of parliament

45:36.767 --> 45:39.793
to get certain pieces
of legislation passed.

45:39.870 --> 45:43.101
You see, the problem is,
when you ask Amar Singh,

45:43.173 --> 45:44.902
he says, it wasn't my money.

45:44.975 --> 45:46.465
I don't have
that kind of money.

45:46.543 --> 45:49.068
I couldn't have given him
that amount of money.

45:49.146 --> 45:51.444
And in fact, when you look
at Indian public records,

45:51.515 --> 45:54.973
you see that Amar Singh doesn't
have a net worth anything close

45:55.052 --> 45:57.111
to being able to give
that amount of money.

45:57.187 --> 45:58.415
So, where did
the money come from?

46:00.057 --> 46:03.254
Well, sometimes the most obvious
answer is the correct one.

46:03.327 --> 46:05.261
Sant Chatwal is
an Indian businessman

46:05.329 --> 46:07.695
who has been close to
the Clintons for years.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.562
He pledged to raise $5 million

46:09.633 --> 46:12.124
for her 2008
presidential campaign

46:12.202 --> 46:14.295
and Bill Clinton was
at his son's wedding.

46:14.371 --> 46:16.032
They actually named him
as a trustee

46:16.106 --> 46:17.630
of the Clinton Foundation.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.905
When Hillary Clinton was first
running for the Senate in 2000,

46:20.978 --> 46:23.310
Sant Chatwal was in trouble
with a federal agency

46:23.380 --> 46:26.213
called the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

46:26.283 --> 46:30.083
He basically owed them millions
of dollars from unpaid loans.

46:30.154 --> 46:31.849
Well, in 2000, Chatwal throws

46:31.922 --> 46:33.787
a fundraiser
for Hillary Clinton

46:33.857 --> 46:35.984
and he brings in
half a million dollars.

46:36.059 --> 46:37.822
A few months later,
with Bill Clinton

46:37.895 --> 46:39.863
still President of
the United States,

46:39.930 --> 46:42.262
Sant Chatwal's case
with the FDIC

46:42.332 --> 46:46.632
was abruptly settled
for a mere $125,000.

46:46.703 --> 46:48.193
So, basically,
the federal government

46:48.272 --> 46:50.206
got pennies on the dollar.

46:50.274 --> 46:51.707
He would actually
go on to plead guilty

46:51.775 --> 46:56.735
for funneling $180,000 in
illegal campaign contributions

46:56.814 --> 46:58.475
to Hillary Clinton,
among others,

46:58.549 --> 47:00.574
and no one seems to have
made the connection.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.643
Well, maybe one reason no one
made the connection is because

47:03.720 --> 47:07.121
the Clinton Foundation
mysteriously erased any mention

47:07.191 --> 47:09.091
of Sant Chatwal
from the web site

47:09.159 --> 47:11.719
once he had admitted
to his illegal activity.

47:11.795 --> 47:13.262
So, here we are, years later,

47:13.330 --> 47:15.423
and we've got this donation
and a guy's name

47:15.499 --> 47:18.229
who swears he didn't actually
make the donation.

47:18.302 --> 47:21.294
And you've got this longtime
Clinton benefactor who actually

47:21.371 --> 47:24.101
gets the highest
civilian award in India

47:24.174 --> 47:26.802
because of his role in
changing Hillary Clinton's mind

47:26.877 --> 47:28.276
on this nuke deal.

47:28.345 --> 47:30.745
Sant Chatwal says
he's worked with everybody.

47:30.814 --> 47:34.272
And even laid the foundation
of the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal.

47:35.452 --> 47:36.851
So, the Indian
government says that

47:36.920 --> 47:38.387
they have given you
this award for your role

47:38.455 --> 47:41.117
in pushing the Indo-U.S.
nuclear deal forward.

47:41.191 --> 47:42.783
How exactly
would you describe

47:42.860 --> 47:44.919
the role you played
in this?

47:44.995 --> 47:47.122
Well, I can tell you,
the Indo nuclear power deal,

47:47.197 --> 47:49.461
if you look at it,
I am the first one

47:49.533 --> 47:50.591
that laid the foundation.

47:53.570 --> 47:55.663
On the eve
of the vote in 2008

47:55.739 --> 47:59.470
to approve Indian access to U.S.
civilian nuclear technology,

47:59.543 --> 48:02.341
Amar Singh, who barely knows
Hillary Clinton,

48:02.412 --> 48:04.004
had a two-hour meeting with her

48:04.081 --> 48:07.346
where they discussed
the Indian nuclear deal.

48:07.417 --> 48:08.941
Amar Singh says
that the dinner meeting

48:09.019 --> 48:12.853
resulted in her telling him that
she was supportive of the deal,

48:12.923 --> 48:15.050
and that she was making efforts
to make sure

48:15.125 --> 48:16.990
that the deal did get through.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.722
And lo and behold, by 2008,

48:19.796 --> 48:21.957
Hillary Clinton was
fully in support

48:22.032 --> 48:24.500
and in favor of this policy,
in a way that was

48:24.568 --> 48:27.298
a complete reversal
of the position

48:27.371 --> 48:29.134
that she had taken before.

48:29.206 --> 48:31.367
In other words, the flow of
money had led the Clintons

48:31.441 --> 48:34.968
to change their positions
on the Non-Proliferation Treaty,

48:35.045 --> 48:37.309
and specifically,
India getting access

48:37.381 --> 48:39.713
to U.S. nuclear technology.

48:39.783 --> 48:42.479
This was a decision
that was wholly out of step,

48:42.552 --> 48:45.851
wholly inconsistent with
the progressive liberal agenda.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.891
Hillary Clinton
made the decision of

48:47.958 --> 48:50.119
reversing her
previous position

48:50.193 --> 48:53.026
after the flow of funds
to the Clinton Foundation,

48:53.096 --> 48:55.564
and her husband gave
some speeches in India.

48:55.632 --> 48:58.260
But this wouldn't be the last
time Hillary reversed herself

48:58.335 --> 49:00.860
regarding nuclear
weapons technology.

49:00.938 --> 49:04.305
Shockingly, Bill and Hillary
would end up receiving money

49:04.374 --> 49:06.842
from folks that were looking
to make something happen

49:06.910 --> 49:08.605
a lot closer to home.

49:28.465 --> 49:30.262
I think the Russian
uranium story

49:30.334 --> 49:33.098
is perhaps the most shocking
and most blatant example

49:33.170 --> 49:34.637
of how the Clintons operate.

49:34.705 --> 49:38.334
This is a story about the
Russian state nuclear agency,

49:38.408 --> 49:44.313
American uranium, $145 million
in cash, and the Clintons.

49:44.381 --> 49:46.611
At the end of the day,
this is a story

49:46.683 --> 49:50.084
about buying influence
and selling influence.

49:50.153 --> 49:52.451
The Clintons are
the sellers of influence.

49:52.522 --> 49:56.891
The Canadian investors
and the Russians are the buyers.

49:56.960 --> 50:00.919
Bill Clinton had gone to the
central Asian country of Kazakhstan,

50:00.998 --> 50:04.263
in 2005, with Frank Giustra.

50:04.334 --> 50:06.461
Kazakhstan is a country
that has been run,

50:06.536 --> 50:08.436
since the collapse of
the Soviet Union,

50:08.505 --> 50:10.803
by a dictator named Nazarbayev,

50:10.874 --> 50:12.933
who shuts down
political opposition

50:13.010 --> 50:15.205
and tortures
political opponents.

50:15.278 --> 50:17.769
The ostensible purpose
of the visit to Kazakhstan

50:17.848 --> 50:23.115
by Bill Clinton was to talk
with Nazarbayev about aids/HIV.

50:23.186 --> 50:25.620
The problem is,
Kazakhstan really does not have

50:25.689 --> 50:29.125
an aids/HIV problem,
so, that explanation

50:29.192 --> 50:30.659
really doesn't make sense.

50:30.727 --> 50:34.561
What makes far more sense is
that Frank Giustra wanted access

50:34.631 --> 50:38.260
to very lucrative
Kazakh uranium mines.

50:38.335 --> 50:40.394
Kazakhstan is one of
the largest producers

50:40.470 --> 50:42.335
of uranium in the world.

50:42.406 --> 50:44.670
Bill Clinton arrives there
with Frank Giustra,

50:44.741 --> 50:47.904
and they have a series of
meetings with Kazakh officials.

50:47.978 --> 50:50.970
There's a press conference
where Bill Clinton stands

50:51.048 --> 50:52.606
with the dictator
of Kazakhstan

50:52.682 --> 50:55.776
and he praises
the human rights record.

50:55.852 --> 50:58.616
He praises that elections that
are being held in the country,

50:58.688 --> 51:01.088
and he even says that
Kazakhstan should head up

51:01.158 --> 51:03.388
something called
the OSCE, which is

51:03.460 --> 51:07.055
the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.

51:07.130 --> 51:08.654
Think about that for a second.

51:08.732 --> 51:11.792
Bill Clinton is saying that
a known human rights violator,

51:11.868 --> 51:14.359
who's been condemned by
human rights organizations

51:14.438 --> 51:18.397
around the world, should head up
a human rights organization.

51:18.475 --> 51:20.739
They go from a press
conference to a dinner where

51:20.811 --> 51:24.372
Frank Giustra, Nazarbayev,
the dictator of Kazakhstan,

51:24.448 --> 51:27.144
and Bill Clinton meet and talk.

51:27.217 --> 51:29.515
Well, two days
after that meeting,

51:29.586 --> 51:33.249
Frank Giustra finally
gets his uranium concessions,

51:33.323 --> 51:35.791
worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.

51:35.859 --> 51:37.019
A couple of weeks after that,

51:37.094 --> 51:40.257
Bill Clinton gets his
$30 million from Frank Giustra,

51:40.330 --> 51:42.389
the first payment
in what will become

51:42.466 --> 51:45.299
more than $100 million
in pledges and commitments

51:45.368 --> 51:47.598
and donations,
made by Frank Giustra.

51:50.740 --> 51:53.470
So, it's really in a way
a simple story,

51:53.543 --> 51:56.011
in that they all are
walking away from the table

51:56.079 --> 51:57.478
with something that they want.

51:57.547 --> 52:01.244
Nazarbayev is getting the
legitimacy of an ex-president

52:01.318 --> 52:03.752
saying what a nice
and kind leader he is,

52:03.820 --> 52:06.015
Frank Giustra gets his
uranium concession,

52:06.089 --> 52:09.490
and Bill Clinton and his
foundation get cold, hard cash.

52:12.829 --> 52:15.093
Now let's move to
chapter two of this story,

52:15.165 --> 52:17.099
which is even more sinister.

52:17.167 --> 52:19.032
You see, the international
uranium market

52:19.102 --> 52:20.467
is very competitive.

52:20.537 --> 52:22.596
The Kremlin sees
dominance and control

52:22.672 --> 52:25.903
of the uranium market
as a source of national power.

52:25.976 --> 52:29.742
Frank Giustra takes that uranium
concession he got in Kazakhstan

52:29.813 --> 52:33.715
and puts it into a company
in a so-called reverse merger,

52:33.783 --> 52:36.718
which is one way for
a private company to go public,

52:36.786 --> 52:39.687
to form something called
Uranium One.

52:39.756 --> 52:42.589
It's a company traded on
the stock market in Canada.

52:42.659 --> 52:45.526
And they start acquiring
uranium concessions

52:45.595 --> 52:49.759
in places like Wyoming, Texas,
New Mexico, and Utah.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.802
And by 2009, they have
what is expected to be

52:52.869 --> 52:56.930
50% of future uranium production
in the United States.

52:57.007 --> 53:00.204
This gets the interest of Vladimir
Putin and the Russian government,

53:00.277 --> 53:02.745
and in fact there are
State Department cables,

53:02.812 --> 53:04.541
that were leaked
through Wikileaks,

53:04.614 --> 53:06.673
which show that Hillary
was aware of the fact

53:06.750 --> 53:09.719
that the Russians took
great care to try to dominate

53:09.786 --> 53:12.516
the international
uranium market.

53:12.589 --> 53:14.784
Well, the Russians
wanna buy this asset,

53:14.858 --> 53:19.295
and they offer a 40% overprice
on the share of the stock,

53:19.362 --> 53:20.954
and for this transaction
to go through,

53:21.031 --> 53:23.966
it has to be approved
by the U.S. federal government.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.264
Why? Because uranium
is regarded

53:26.336 --> 53:29.703
as a critical industry
in the United States.

53:29.773 --> 53:33.539
After all, this is used for
our civilian nuclear reactors,

53:33.610 --> 53:35.601
and goes into nuclear weapons.

53:35.679 --> 53:37.271
So, it goes before
the federal government,

53:37.347 --> 53:41.477
where it needs to be signed off
by a series of federal agencies,

53:41.551 --> 53:44.748
including the Secretary
of State, Hillary Clinton.

53:44.821 --> 53:46.846
As Hillary Clinton
is contemplating this,

53:46.923 --> 53:50.518
shareholders in uranium one,
including Frank Giustra,

53:50.594 --> 53:54.928
have sent more than $145 million
to the Clinton Foundation.

53:54.998 --> 53:57.398
The chairman of that company
at the precise time

53:57.467 --> 53:58.934
is a guy named Ian Telfer,

53:59.002 --> 54:02.403
who is also making donations
to the Clinton Foundation.

54:02.472 --> 54:04.997
As is Frank Holmes,
who was another major

54:05.075 --> 54:06.633
Uranium One shareholder.

54:06.710 --> 54:09.543
And Hillary Clinton, who
has a record of opposing

54:09.613 --> 54:11.444
precisely these kinds of deals,

54:11.514 --> 54:13.414
comes out and says,
you know what?

54:13.483 --> 54:14.745
I think this is a good deal.

54:14.818 --> 54:17.412
Let's let Vladimir Putin
take control

54:17.487 --> 54:20.979
of what is now 20% of
U.S. uranium production.

54:24.561 --> 54:26.222
Bill Clinton
and Hillary Clinton

54:26.296 --> 54:29.026
are the only figures
in American politics

54:29.099 --> 54:30.589
who are willing
to do this deal,

54:30.667 --> 54:32.498
and who could
actually pull it off,

54:32.569 --> 54:35.333
because they had a reputation
that runs so contrary

54:35.405 --> 54:36.838
to what they're doing.

54:36.906 --> 54:39.568
I mean, this is what the
Clinton Foundation does, right?

54:39.643 --> 54:41.440
This is what they
talk about politically,

54:41.511 --> 54:42.876
their support for human rights,

54:42.946 --> 54:44.846
their concerns
about proliferation,

54:44.914 --> 54:48.179
their concerns about issues
related to Russian aggression.

54:48.251 --> 54:50.776
There's doubt that when Putin
came back in and said

54:50.854 --> 54:52.583
he was going to
be president, uh,

54:52.656 --> 54:54.817
that did change
the relationship.

54:54.891 --> 54:57.155
We have to stand up
to his bullying and...

54:57.227 --> 55:00.526
what's so interesting when
you consider this uranium deal

55:00.597 --> 55:03.430
are the actions of a small
Canadian investment firm

55:03.500 --> 55:04.990
called Salida Capital.

55:05.068 --> 55:10.062
Salida Capital, in 2010,
as this deal was going down,

55:10.140 --> 55:13.803
committed to give millions of
dollars to the Clinton Foundation

55:13.877 --> 55:17.335
and they also sponsored a speech
by Bill Clinton in Canada.

55:17.414 --> 55:19.780
Salida capital
is also the name of

55:19.849 --> 55:22.750
a wholly owned
subsidiary of Rosatom.

55:22.819 --> 55:23.808
Who is Rosatom?

55:23.887 --> 55:26.253
Well, this is the government
agency in Russia

55:26.323 --> 55:28.450
that controls their
nuclear arsenal,

55:28.525 --> 55:30.891
that built nuclear reactors
in Iran,

55:30.960 --> 55:33.793
and engages in
nuclear technology exchanges

55:33.863 --> 55:36.525
with rogue countries
like North Korea.

55:36.599 --> 55:39.363
What this means in essence
is that the Russian government,

55:39.436 --> 55:42.030
specifically Rosatom,
was funneling money

55:42.105 --> 55:45.768
through a subsidiary directly
to the Clinton Foundation.

55:45.842 --> 55:47.742
But the payday
didn't end there.

55:47.811 --> 55:50.075
4 months before Hillary
Clinton's State Department

55:50.146 --> 55:53.411
would sign off on the Russian
purchase of Uranium One,

55:53.483 --> 55:56.543
Bill Clinton got paid $500,000

55:56.619 --> 55:59.645
to give a single speech
in Moscow.

55:59.723 --> 56:02.954
He was being paid by a firm
called Renaissance Capital,

56:03.026 --> 56:06.018
which has a long history
of association with

56:06.096 --> 56:08.257
Russian intelligence services.

56:08.331 --> 56:10.060
What makes this speech
stand out

56:10.133 --> 56:13.000
is not only the timing
of when he's being paid,

56:13.069 --> 56:15.128
but the amount that
he's being paid.

56:15.205 --> 56:18.197
You see, the last time Bill
Clinton gave a speech in Russia

56:18.274 --> 56:19.866
was 5 years earlier.

56:19.943 --> 56:21.604
At that time, he was paid about

56:21.678 --> 56:24.511
1/3 of what he was
being paid this time.

56:28.451 --> 56:34.287
Why is Russian control of 20%
of U.S. uranium so troubling?

56:34.357 --> 56:37.849
If you're in an era where
nuclear weapons are a reality,

56:37.927 --> 56:40.395
where nuclear energy is
an important component

56:40.463 --> 56:42.624
of energy production
in the United States,

56:42.699 --> 56:44.690
and increasingly
around the world,

56:44.768 --> 56:47.601
control of uranium
is absolutely crucial.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.194
And unlike oil or natural gas

56:49.272 --> 56:52.139
can be found so many places
around the world,

56:52.208 --> 56:54.642
there are precious few places
where you can find

56:54.711 --> 56:56.941
significant and large
amounts of uranium

56:57.013 --> 56:59.072
that you can produce
on a commercial scale.

57:00.617 --> 57:02.448
What we've essentially done
is handed this

57:02.519 --> 57:04.453
precious resource
to Vladimir Putin

57:04.521 --> 57:06.148
and the Russian government.

57:06.222 --> 57:08.019
They're not only
engaged in aggression

57:08.091 --> 57:09.524
in places like Ukraine,

57:09.592 --> 57:10.991
but they've been very
aggressive in fighting

57:11.060 --> 57:13.153
American interests
around the globe.

57:13.229 --> 57:15.891
Russia's not an ally.
Russia's not a friend.

57:15.965 --> 57:19.196
Vladimir Putin's Russia is
a rival of the United States,

57:19.269 --> 57:22.568
and yet we've given them control
over this precious resource.

57:33.082 --> 57:35.550
This is what's
gonna power America.

57:35.618 --> 57:37.313
I think a lot of people
in middle America

57:37.387 --> 57:40.322
would be surprised to know
that the Russian government

57:40.390 --> 57:45.487
is doing business in places like
Colorado or Wyoming or Utah.

57:45.562 --> 57:47.029
These are small mining towns.

57:47.096 --> 57:50.657
These are operations that
have existed for a while,

57:50.733 --> 57:52.963
that have been under the control
of American companies,

57:53.036 --> 57:54.731
or for a while
Canadian companies,

57:54.804 --> 57:57.671
but it's now Russian companies
that control this,

57:57.740 --> 57:59.173
and those companies
are controlled

57:59.242 --> 58:00.539
by the Russian government.

58:02.779 --> 58:06.613
Having read through
the archives of the KGB,

58:06.683 --> 58:08.150
the files that
have been released,

58:08.218 --> 58:11.187
i can tell you that they
look at the United States

58:11.254 --> 58:13.188
as weak and ineffectual.

58:13.256 --> 58:14.814
This is a thuggish government

58:14.891 --> 58:18.554
that is engaged in massive
human rights violations.

58:18.628 --> 58:19.890
There are opponents
of this regime

58:19.963 --> 58:21.794
that have been killed
or have disappeared.

58:21.865 --> 58:25.028
There's been persecution of
human rights organization.

58:25.101 --> 58:27.194
There's been persecution
of homosexuals.

58:27.270 --> 58:30.967
And it's shocking and stunning
to me that there has not been

58:31.040 --> 58:33.440
more attention focused
to this fact,

58:33.510 --> 58:35.341
that we have given
this critical resource

58:35.411 --> 58:38.938
to somebody who is engaged
in so much nefarious behavior.

58:42.418 --> 58:45.046
Greetings from Washington.

58:45.121 --> 58:48.613
I want to thank all of you for
your work to root out corruption

58:48.691 --> 58:50.886
that weakens
economic development,

58:50.960 --> 58:53.520
feeds black markets
and organized crime,

58:53.596 --> 58:56.156
and undermines the promise
of democracy.

58:56.232 --> 58:59.963
As we work together to eradicate
corruption in our own country,

59:00.036 --> 59:02.527
we should also maintain
the highest standards of

59:02.605 --> 59:04.573
transparency and accountability

59:04.641 --> 59:07.439
in our development efforts
around the world.

59:07.510 --> 59:10.411
Corruption in emerging markets
and fragile democracies

59:10.480 --> 59:14.143
undermines the confidence of
citizens and investors alike,

59:14.217 --> 59:16.515
while responsible governance
helps to foster

59:16.586 --> 59:19.953
sustainable economic development
and political stability.

59:21.891 --> 59:24.860
I believe in the oldest
adage in American politics,

59:24.928 --> 59:27.294
which is follow the money.

59:27.363 --> 59:30.059
Enormous amounts of money
have flowed to the Clintons,

59:30.133 --> 59:32.624
from foreign governments,
foreign financiers,

59:32.702 --> 59:33.999
and businesses.

59:34.070 --> 59:36.061
Some of that money
lands in their pocket,

59:36.139 --> 59:38.266
some of it lands
in their foundation.

59:38.341 --> 59:40.969
It's a pattern we've seen
repeated over and over

59:41.044 --> 59:43.478
and over again
all around the world.

59:43.546 --> 59:44.877
It's not a coincidence.

59:44.948 --> 59:47.610
Money exchanges hands
and favors are done.

59:47.684 --> 59:48.912
Now, Clinton
friends and supporters

59:48.985 --> 59:51.078
will say there's
no smoking gun.

59:51.154 --> 59:53.145
But look at American
political history.

59:53.222 --> 59:56.680
People are convicted all the
time for a pattern of behavior,

59:56.759 --> 59:58.090
where, for example,
they're engaged in

59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.391
insider trading
on the stock market.

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:03.660
So, for example, you have
a foreign corporation

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:06.065
or a foreign government
that wants something

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.262
from the State Department
while Hillary Clinton

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.828
is Secretary of State.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:13.171
They will make a large payment
to the Clinton Foundation.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.573
That will be followed by

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:17.112
favorable action
on their behalf.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.580
If that happens one or
two times, you might say,

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.742
look, it's just a coincidence.

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:24.378
But when you see
the pattern recreated

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.321
over and over and over again,

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:30.882
you have to recognize that
these events are connected.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.123
They've created a model
for massive self-enrichment,

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:38.258
that allows you to go into
so-called public service,

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:41.428
but get extremely rich
at the same time.

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.870
And when friends and allies
say that the Clintons

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.771
aren't really
that interested in money,

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:48.140
their actions show otherwise.

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:50.145
What's so shocking
to a lot of people

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:53.148
is that making of that money
requires them

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:56.208
to betray their
progressive values.

01:00:56.285 --> 01:01:00.949
The environment, labor unions,
women's rights, human rights.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:04.221
The Clintons are doing business
and growing rich,

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:06.989
with the favor of
the very individuals

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:10.555
who you would expect to be
their political opposites.

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.760
For a very long time
in American history

01:01:12.835 --> 01:01:14.302
and probably still to this day,

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:15.803
one of the worst things
that could be said

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:18.170
about you as a politician
is that you are

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:20.334
on the take from
foreign interests.

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.809
What the Clintons
have essentially done

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.812
is busted down the door

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.314
and robbed the bank
of that concept.

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:28.714
So, when people think of the
Clintons taking foreign money,

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:32.084
they think it's maybe an insurance
company from great Britain,

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:35.124
or they think it's from
a supermarket chain in Canada.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:37.182
The fact of the matter
is a lot of that money

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.718
comes from the darkest,
worst corners of the world.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.890
Are countries like
Nigeria and Russia

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.160
in the habit of giving money
to politicians

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.225
and not wanting something back?

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:49.362
The Clintons are glad
to take this money.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.407
It's made them
fabulously wealthy.

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:53.601
But what has it done for us?

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:54.870
Before we had to worry about

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.673
money from Wall Street
and big labor,

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.408
now we have to worry about it
coming from around the world

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:02.974
and infecting our politics,
and damaging our politics.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.043
Everything from
our uranium policy

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:06.816
to our human rights policy.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:09.119
Nothing seems to be
safe anymore.

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:11.717
This is a corruption.
This is a crime.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:14.058
With the Clintons,
nothing is sacred.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.722
Everything is for sale.

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:18.961
But we are the ones
who are paying the price.

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:21.526
Maybe, just maybe,
the American people

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:23.333
are tired of being sold out.
