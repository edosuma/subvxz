Hello and welcome
to another exciting episode

01:05.230 --> 01:08.359
of the craziest game in the galaxy:

01:08.443 --> 01:11.446
Garfle Warfle Snick.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.661
And now here's the host
of Garfle Warfle Snick...

01:18.745 --> 01:20.538
Bob!

01:22.123 --> 01:24.125
Thank you, Norlox. Hi, everybody.

01:24.209 --> 01:28.630
Welcome to another exciting edition
of Garfle Warfle Snick,

01:28.713 --> 01:32.884
the game where anything you garfle
will be warfled, and vice versa.

01:32.967 --> 01:36.054
I'm Bob. Now let's meet
the intergalactic goofballs

01:36.137 --> 01:37.722
we've got playing with us today.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.474
What is this place?

01:39.557 --> 01:42.268
Looks like some kind of game show.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.271
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.941
The last thing I remember,
we were all flying in our lions.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.443
Hi, there. Tell us your name
and where you're from.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.487
-What is this?
-Uh-oh.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.906
Looks like somebody
wasn't listening to Norlox.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.574
Hmph!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.702
Tell him what this is, everybody.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.705
Garfle Warfle Snick!

02:03.123 --> 02:06.709
That's right, the name of the game
is Garfle Warfle Snick.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.627
Now tell us your name, son.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.464
My name is Keith.
How did we get here?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.883
I'll tell you how Norlox
got to be on the show.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.552
His uncle owns the studio.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.934
All right, Keith, why don't
you introduce us to the rest of your team?

02:23.017 --> 02:25.061
We're the Paladins of Voltron.

02:25.145 --> 02:29.190
This is Allura, Hunk, Lance, and Pidge.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.443
But you haven't answered my question.
How did we get here?

02:32.527 --> 02:34.487
I hope not the same way I got here.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.448
A moofglider was jackknifed
on the Haldar Expressway

02:37.532 --> 02:39.909
and it took forever to get past it.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.703
I still smell like moof.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.454
Ew!

02:43.538 --> 02:46.249
Okay, Keith, I'm sure you know
how to play our game.

02:46.332 --> 02:51.004
All you've gotta do is accumulate
quaz-cenbullion credits, and you win.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.756
Of course, if you don't,
you'll hear this sound.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.259
Aw.

02:56.342 --> 03:00.805
And that means you're trapped here
in our studio for the rest of eternity.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.015
Wait, what?

03:02.098 --> 03:04.809
Did you say we'll be trapped here
for the rest of eternity?

03:04.893 --> 03:08.062
Uh-oh. Is there an echo in here?
Echo in here?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.565
I don't know who you are
or what's going on,

03:10.648 --> 03:11.983
but we're getting out of here.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.152
Oh, I don't think so.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.155
Huh?

03:19.115 --> 03:21.659
-My feet are stuck.
-Mine, too.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.454
See, all of you are guests on my show

03:24.537 --> 03:29.125
and you will
play my game as long as I want you to.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.710
Understand?

03:32.420 --> 03:36.466
Great! Let's start with our first warfler.
Tell us what it is, Norlox.

03:36.925 --> 03:40.470
The first warfler is... Pictation!

03:44.474 --> 03:46.017
Come on over here, Keith.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.311
Pictation, the drawing game.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.647
Now, Keith, the answers
will pop up on your screen

03:50.730 --> 03:52.106
where your team can't see them.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.318
It's up to you to draw the people
and places you've seen

03:55.401 --> 03:58.112
during your adventures
as a Paladin of Voltron

03:58.196 --> 04:00.740
while your team
tries to guess the answers.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.744
-Are you a good artist, Keith?
-I, uh...

04:04.827 --> 04:07.664
Well, I hope you're a better drawer
than a talker, huh?

04:09.916 --> 04:13.503
Let's put blazzle hoochas on the board.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.630
And... go!

04:16.172 --> 04:18.800
The answer is Arusian.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.552
It's a rock! Balmera!

04:21.719 --> 04:23.304
- Olkari cube!
- It's a chicken!

04:23.471 --> 04:25.515
When did we see a chicken
in outer space?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.892
I don't know.
It's not my fault Keith can't draw.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.979
Rooster! A chicken hawk.
A chicken with a beard!

04:31.479 --> 04:34.023
-It's an Arusian!
-Correct!

04:35.441 --> 04:38.361
The answer is Blade of Marmora.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.822
What is that, chopsticks?

04:40.905 --> 04:42.323
It's something from space, Lance.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.533
Space chopsticks?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.910
It's a knife. Sword?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.538
-Oh, oh! Blade of Marmora!
-Right again!

04:48.913 --> 04:51.624
The answer is Red Lion.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.920
- Dog! It's a dog!
- It's a lion.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.589
Black Lion, Blue Lion,
Yellow Lion, Red Lion.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.008
Red Lion is right!

05:00.091 --> 05:01.467
-Yeah!
-Way to go, Hunk!

05:01.551 --> 05:03.970
The answer is Haggar.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.140
Pepperoni. An alligator!
A cave, a windy cave!

05:07.223 --> 05:09.392
Oh, no, no, no. What is that thing called?
It's a thermos!

05:09.475 --> 05:11.269
Lance, would you stop talking?

05:12.437 --> 05:14.314
Oh! Time's up.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.400
What? No way that was blazzle hoochas.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.321
Looks like our other team
is gonna have the opportunity to steal.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.739
What other team?

05:28.619 --> 05:31.372
-Zarkon? No way!
-This can't be happening.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.585
-Hello there.
-Hello, Bob.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.962
Why don't you introduce yourself
to the audience and tell us

05:38.046 --> 05:40.131
who these wonderful people are with you?

05:40.214 --> 05:44.135
I'm Zarkon.
This is my lovely wife Haggar.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.888
-Hello.
-Hubba hubba.

05:46.971 --> 05:52.852
My son Lotor and one of my insignificant
underlings, Morvok.

05:52.935 --> 05:57.065
I am such a big fan of the show.
I can't believe we're here!

05:57.231 --> 05:58.649
Well, welcome, welcome.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.487
It's good to have you all on with us,
especially this lovely.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.822
- Hmm? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Ooh!

06:04.906 --> 06:07.742
Watch it, now.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.703
All right, Zarkon,
have you been watching backstage?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.538
Yes, I have.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.791
The Paladins of Voltron have scored
three correct answers,

06:14.874 --> 06:16.959
but now you and your team
have the opportunity

06:17.043 --> 06:18.461
to steal all of their points

06:18.544 --> 06:22.590
if you can correctly identify
what ol' Keith was doodling on there.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.928
Well, I'd rather steal their lions
than their points.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.387
Yeah, I bet you would.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.894
-Uh, why are they acting like that?
-It doesn't matter.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.146
There's no way we're going to lose
to the Galra.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.693
But seriously, I think I can guess this.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.154
You might not like the answer.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.449
Uh-oh. Don't wanna stir up any trouble
with the missus.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.243
She doesn't look like that drawing,

06:50.326 --> 06:53.579
but I'm pretty sure
the answer he was going for was...

06:53.663 --> 06:55.206
Fingers crossed.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.791
Is it Haggar?

06:57.667 --> 07:01.546
That is correct!
The answer is Haggar.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.635
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

07:08.094 --> 07:10.888
-This is really bizarre.
-Windy cave?

07:10.972 --> 07:12.974
Hey! I'm not a mind reader.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.560
So, Zarkon, you have garfled
the first warfler.

07:15.643 --> 07:19.313
That puts you in control of the board.
Do you wanna play or pass?

07:19.397 --> 07:20.231
Play!

07:20.314 --> 07:24.610
I spent centuries perfecting
my exquisite, lifelike renderings.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.279
Not that you cared.

07:26.362 --> 07:30.199
-I treasure your art.
-Don't touch me, you filthy, filthy hag!

07:30.283 --> 07:33.411
Don't speak to her that way,
you insolent whelp.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.372
Ow!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.707
I didn't do nothing!

07:38.124 --> 07:39.584
Family, am I right?

07:39.792 --> 07:42.420
They are quite a handful.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.172
So, what's it gonna be, Z?

07:44.255 --> 07:48.801
Well, I've always said
that the best offense is a good defense.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.721
-Sounds like you're gonna pass.
-I am.

07:51.804 --> 07:55.892
And I think I'd also like to play this.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.768
- Ooh.
- Uh-oh!

07:57.852 --> 07:59.395
The solo card!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.105
That means one of these Paladins

08:01.189 --> 08:03.858
is gonna have to take
the next warfler alone.

08:03.941 --> 08:07.153
The question is, Zarkon,
which one is it gonna be?

08:07.236 --> 08:11.449
Well, I think there's
really no choice here.

08:11.532 --> 08:14.285
I'm going with the dumb one!

08:17.455 --> 08:18.789
Who's he talking about?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.584
It's time for a word from our sponsors.

08:21.667 --> 08:25.129
But when we get back,
Lance will be starting the next warfler

08:25.213 --> 08:26.547
all by his lonesome.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.840
Stick around.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.968
Wait, I'm the dumb one?

08:31.052 --> 08:33.929
Garfle Warfle Snick
is sponsored by...

08:35.306 --> 08:37.517
Come on down to It's Earth

08:37.600 --> 08:41.145
for the craziest Earth deals
in the galaxy.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.438
We've got throwing discs with cases.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.067
Twenty GAC, or six for a hundred.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.861
We've got a luxury seat
that doubles as a water fountain.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.697
That's two-in-one for one low price:
1,500 GAC.

08:51.781 --> 08:55.243
Yggiz aliens would say,
"I'm snarloft in the cranker!"

08:55.326 --> 08:56.577
And they're right!

08:56.744 --> 08:58.621
We've got a foot scraper.
Forty-nine GAC.

08:58.704 --> 09:01.749
A skin sucker for your foot scrapings.
Fifty-seven GAC.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.961
The arcade 3000 exercise machine.
Twenty-five hundred GAC.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.422
And don't forget, each purchase
comes with a free Kaltenecker.

09:08.506 --> 09:12.552
That's right, we're out of our crankers!

09:13.094 --> 09:16.138
And now back
to Garfle Warfle Snick.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.475
Right before the break,
Zarkon's team decided

09:19.559 --> 09:23.020
to make one of the Paladins of Voltron
play solo the next round,

09:23.104 --> 09:27.358
and the Paladin he chose
was the dumb one, Lance.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.736
-Hey, Lance, how's it going?
-Well, you know what, I'm not too happy

09:30.820 --> 09:33.948
about being referred to
as "the dumb one," like, 18 times.

09:34.031 --> 09:38.119
Oh, it was only about four times,
you big dum-dum.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.499
But now you've got a chance
to change all that

09:43.583 --> 09:46.043
and show everyone
how smart you really are.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.421
-Are you ready for that?
-Absolutely.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.257
Okay! Let's give Lance
a big round of applause!

09:51.340 --> 09:53.092
He is a great sport.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.720
Norlox, tell Lance
what the next warfler is.

09:56.596 --> 10:00.391
The next warfler is Faces From the Past!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.893
A little walk down memory lane.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.438
Lance, you know how this game goes,
am I right?

10:05.896 --> 10:07.940
Yeah! Totally.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.611
What do you think, audience?
Do we believe this beautiful dum-dum?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.654
No!

10:13.738 --> 10:16.824
I know you're telling the truth, Lance,
but just for the folks at home,

10:16.907 --> 10:18.701
let's run through the rules real quick.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.245
Now, you're gonna see pictures
of some of the folks you've met

10:21.329 --> 10:23.289
on your adventures around the galaxy.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.167
All you have to do is tell us their names.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.545
I'll give you a goolian credits
for each one you name correctly,

10:29.629 --> 10:31.756
adding to the points you'll need
to earn your freedom.

10:31.839 --> 10:32.798
How does that sound?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.761
Sounds like we're going to be getting back
to Voltron pretty soon.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.095
That's the spirit!

10:38.179 --> 10:40.681
But just to make sure you don't get
any help from your friends,

10:40.765 --> 10:44.143
let's lower the isolation shield.

10:45.686 --> 10:49.565
Perfect. Now let's see
our first mystery face from the past.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.905
Easy. That's Koli-- What? Who's that?

10:56.197 --> 10:57.448
He's an important figure.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.201
Someone who helped you
in your fight against Zarkon.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.996
Hmm. Keith keeps pointing
at his blade, so...

11:04.080 --> 11:07.541
Oh. That's a pretty big clue.
Have you got a guess?

11:14.382 --> 11:16.425
Blade-y.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.302
Bladey?

11:18.386 --> 11:21.639
Oh! The answer is Antok.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.974
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah, that guy.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.520
Kolivan's right-hand man
who fought valiantly

11:27.603 --> 11:29.438
for the good of the universe.

11:29.522 --> 11:33.818
This next one is a little more personal.
I think you'll remember this gal.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.405
Ooh! Her? Yeah, that's Plax-- Her?

11:38.197 --> 11:39.865
She was the serious one?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.701
That's right. What was her name?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.788
Uh... oh! Hold on. Okay, I know this.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.582
She was the one who measured
my head for the jellyfish hat.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.210
- She rode on a giant manta ray.
- We need an answer.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.170
Ah... mm.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.713
Wait, was it Jelly? No, no! Shelly!

11:54.797 --> 11:57.800
Her name is Swirn.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.970
Swirn? Huh.
Never would've come up with that.

12:01.178 --> 12:04.056
Go Galra! Go Galra!
Go Galra!

12:04.306 --> 12:06.892
Your team is starting
to lose faith in you, Lance.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.146
I'm just not real good with names.
I'll get the next one.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.983
I hope so. Let's see the next face
from your past.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.445
Finally, a name I know.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.072
Quiznak! Can you guys stop changing it
at the last second?

12:20.531 --> 12:21.532
Hmm.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.452
-This guy, this guy...
-You remember.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.828
He faked the distress signal.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.581
-He stole the Blue Lion.
-That, too.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.082
What's his name?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.835
Okay.
It's on the tip of my tongue.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.629
Traveled with Nyma and Beezer.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.506
Yeah. Pidge loved that robot.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.510
Nope. I got nothing.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.139
-Rolo!
-Rolo!

12:45.222 --> 12:47.725
You are terrible at this.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.894
To be fair, we've met a lot of people.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.062
Well, this is the last face, Lance.

12:52.146 --> 12:55.941
If you finish without a single
correct answer, you know what that means.

12:56.025 --> 12:56.984
No. What?

12:57.067 --> 12:59.904
Snick! Snick! Snick! Snick!

12:59.987 --> 13:02.823
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

13:03.657 --> 13:06.076
I can't hear what they're saying.
Is it "Snick"?

13:06.160 --> 13:10.122
That's right! Miss this next question,
and I will be forced to hit this button,

13:10.414 --> 13:15.127
which will shoot you out of the studio
and into the lair of the Snick.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.463
Show us the Snick, Norlox.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.052
Ooh!

13:23.135 --> 13:24.512
He looks hungry.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.640
What? Nobody said anything
about the Snick!

13:27.890 --> 13:31.644
Well, it's in the title of the show.
Garfle Warfle Snick!

13:31.894 --> 13:34.271
I wasn't listening to that!
You know I'm the dumb one!

13:34.355 --> 13:37.608
Well, here's your last face, dum-dum.
Look carefully.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.069
Quiet! I need to concentrate!

13:48.536 --> 13:50.913
It's Bii-Boh-Bi! Bii-Boh-Bi!

13:50.996 --> 13:54.375
That's right!
You are not gonna get fed to the Snick.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.295
They are savages.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.340
Well, sorry, Zarkon.
Looks like you're going home.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.843
-It was just fun being on the show.
-Shut up.

14:06.637 --> 14:10.057
And now, since he's the only person
in the galaxy Lance can remember,

14:10.140 --> 14:11.350
let's bring him out!

14:11.433 --> 14:16.397
Ladies and gentlemen,
star of the hit stick-com,  Bii-Boh Me ,

14:16.480 --> 14:19.316
the one and only Bii-Boh-Bi!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.239
Bii-Boh, welcome back to the show.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.992
Seems like you've been pretty busy
since we saw you last.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.452
Bii-bi-boh, bi-boh-bii, bii-bii-bii-bii,

14:30.536 --> 14:32.746
bi-bi-boh, bii-bii!

14:34.999 --> 14:36.792
Yeah!

14:37.167 --> 14:41.755
Okay, Bii. You're an old pro at this,
so maybe you can help this dum-dum out.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.465
Bii-boh, boh-bii.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.635
Norlox, what is our next warfler?

14:46.844 --> 14:49.471
- It's the Garflater!
- Oh!

14:50.389 --> 14:51.849
All right, now, as everyone knows,

14:51.932 --> 14:54.393
the Garflater
is worth vezcenbullion credits.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.062
So, Lance, this could get you
and your friends

14:57.146 --> 14:58.939
well on your way to freedom.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.149
Let's do this!

15:00.232 --> 15:02.902
Of course, if you don't answer
five questions correctly,

15:02.985 --> 15:07.406
you'll end up in the Garflator,
where you'll be slowly cooked alive.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.577
-What? Come on!
-Let's put blazzle hoochas on the board.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.707
Bii-Boh-Bi, you're giving the clues,
and remember not to say the word.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.418
-Bii-boh.
-Start the Garflator!

15:24.089 --> 15:26.133
Bii, bii-boh-bi.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.010
Um...

15:28.093 --> 15:29.970
I have no idea what's happening right now.

15:30.054 --> 15:30.971
Bii!

15:31.513 --> 15:32.348
Boh!

15:32.723 --> 15:34.058
-Bii!
-Bii?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.935
Correct!

15:36.268 --> 15:37.770
-Boh-boh...
-Bii?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.521
Bii...

15:40.105 --> 15:40.940
Bii-boh?

15:42.107 --> 15:42.942
Bii-bii?

15:43.025 --> 15:43.859
That's two!

15:45.694 --> 15:47.196
-Boh...
-Bii!

15:47.279 --> 15:49.239
Two more to go!

15:49.490 --> 15:51.825
Bii-boh-boh--

15:52.952 --> 15:54.787
You can't say the word.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.996
Bii-boh...

15:56.330 --> 15:58.499
Boh-boh, bii-bii-boh,

15:58.582 --> 16:00.960
boh-bii-boh.

16:01.043 --> 16:01.961
Yeah!

16:02.169 --> 16:05.214
Final clue. Running out of time!

16:05.297 --> 16:07.967
-Boh-boh-boh!
-Bii-boh-bii-bii?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.551
Boh-boh-boh, boh-boh-boh-boh,
boh-boh-boh!

16:09.635 --> 16:11.762
Bii-bii-bii, boh, bii-boh, boh, boh,

16:11.845 --> 16:12.680
bii-bii-bii!

16:12.763 --> 16:14.640
Oh! Oh!

16:14.723 --> 16:17.184
Oh! So close.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.397
The answer was Bi.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.901
-I said that!
-Give it up for Bii-Boh-Bi, everybody!

16:25.985 --> 16:28.696
Bii-boh, bi-bi-bi-bi!

16:30.322 --> 16:33.826
When we come back from the break,
we'll see if Lance's fellow Paladins

16:33.909 --> 16:38.247
can get him out of the Warflator
before he gets turned into hot pudding...

16:38.330 --> 16:39.581
right after this.

16:39.665 --> 16:44.420
Garfle Warfle Snick
is sponsored by Vrepit Sal's!

16:44.503 --> 16:46.338
Come on down to Vrepit Sal's

16:46.422 --> 16:49.717
for family fun
and approved imperial flavors.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.885
For a limited time,
get a Haggar snack pack

16:51.969 --> 16:55.431
every time the Melgregian Fitzers score
three havers in a sprat.

16:55.764 --> 16:59.518
Vrepit Sal's!
Sustenance prepared right.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.732
And now back
to Garfle Warfle Snick.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.608
Welcome back, everybody.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.944
The Paladins of Voltron
are trying to win their way off the show,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.865
but they just lost one of their team
to the Warflator.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.992
-How's it going over there, Lance?
-Actually, this feels great.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.912
The goo is nice and warm,
and it feels like it's exfoliating me.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.082
Well, eventually,
it'll eat through your skin.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.085
But let's see if one of your friends
can help you out.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.756
-Well, hello, Princess.
-What are we doing here, Bob?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.758
We're playing the game.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.428
Please let us go.
The universe needs Voltron.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.389
Well, then the Paladins of Voltron
are just gonna have to get serious

17:37.473 --> 17:38.557
about winning this game.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.935
Now, which one of you do you want to play
to free Lance, huh?

17:42.019 --> 17:44.855
- Who's the brainiest of the team?
- Pidge.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.274
All right, little fellow,
step on out here.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.780
Norlox, tell us what the next warfler is.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.324
It's Bankchannel!

17:57.242 --> 18:00.412
-Hey, miniature golf!
-Miniature what?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.873
This game, it's... Never mind.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.292
All right, let me show you
how to play here.

18:05.375 --> 18:11.298
All you have to do is hit the sphere
through the bankchannel into the tunnel.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.424
Easy.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.470
-Think you can do that?
-I think I can handle it.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.017
Hmm. Mmm...

18:24.853 --> 18:27.147
Oh. Very serious.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.652
The hole is over there.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.372
Let us go now!

18:43.455 --> 18:45.249
Huh?

18:45.916 --> 18:51.296
It looks like the Paladins
have just made it into the final round!

18:54.258 --> 18:55.384
What the...

18:56.468 --> 18:58.971
Okay, I know I've said this before
many times,

18:59.054 --> 19:01.431
but this is the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.893
One of you will now be allowed
to leave the game.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.272
The rest of you will be staying here
with me forever.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.151
You have blazzle hoochas
to write down your choice

19:12.234 --> 19:15.404
for who should get to escape
on the screen in front of you.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.363
Go!

19:26.373 --> 19:30.210
Final hoochas.
Make your selections, everyone.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.633
Hunk, let's start with you.
Who'd you vote for?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.219
Well, Bob, I voted for Allura.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.806
I figured she's the princess,
and she's such a natural leader, you know.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.851
The universe needs her more than
it needs the rest of us, plain and simple.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.603
- Aw!
- Aw. Thank you, Hunk.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.105
Allura, who did you vote for?

19:50.814 --> 19:52.191
I selected Pidge.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.444
She and her family have the best chance
of rebuilding what my father started.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.405
Interesting.
Lance, who got your vote?

19:58.780 --> 20:00.032
I voted for Keith.

20:00.115 --> 20:04.620
He's our leader, plus he's half Galra,
so I think he's, like, the future.

20:04.912 --> 20:09.124
Keith, the leader, who do you think
deserves to make it out of here, huh?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.544
Lance? Why Lance?

20:12.628 --> 20:15.589
I just don't wanna be stuck here
for eternity with Lance.

20:15.672 --> 20:16.548
Aw!

20:16.632 --> 20:18.467
Thanks, man. Wait, what?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.802
We're down to our very last vote.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.223
Pidge, you're the Paladin
that everyone says is the smartest,

20:24.306 --> 20:27.392
the most analytical, the most logical.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.728
Let's see who you voted for.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.482
- Aw!
- Hunk? Seriously?

20:33.899 --> 20:36.360
Yeah. Hunk gets along with everybody.

20:36.443 --> 20:40.697
If anyone's gonna go out into the universe
and bring people together, it's Hunk.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.449
Aw, thanks, Pidge.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.911
No one voted for themselves.

20:45.994 --> 20:49.248
Everyone wanted someone else
to get to leave

20:49.331 --> 20:52.876
and every single one of you got a vote.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.505
So, I guess we all get fed to the Snick
or something now, right?

20:57.172 --> 20:59.383
You all get...

20:59.967 --> 21:02.552
quaz-cenbullion credits!

21:02.636 --> 21:04.221
You win!

21:07.099 --> 21:11.270
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yay!

21:11.353 --> 21:12.229
We're the best!

21:12.437 --> 21:14.481
That's our show, everybody.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.692
From all of us here
at Garfle Warfle Snick,

21:16.775 --> 21:20.779
please have your klanmuirls
spayed or neutered. Good night!

21:32.582 --> 21:33.792
Oh!

21:33.875 --> 21:35.252
Whoa.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.421
Oh. That was messed up.

21:38.171 --> 21:39.381
Hey, guys.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.426
I just kind of dozed off for a second
and I had this crazy dream.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.513
-Garfle Warfle Snick?
-No way.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.056
You guys saw that, too?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.851
So wait, does that mean Bob is real?

21:51.184 --> 21:53.812
Bob? Did you all just meet Bob?

21:53.895 --> 21:56.148
Coran, you know him?

21:56.315 --> 21:59.443
I've never met him myself,
but I've heard tales.

21:59.609 --> 22:03.280
He's an all-powerful, all-knowing
interdimensional being

22:03.363 --> 22:06.366
who judges the worthiness
of great warriors.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.120
Well, I bet he never met anyone
worthier than us.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.415
The legends say that if you meet Bob
and live to tell the tale,

22:13.498 --> 22:15.876
you're destined for great things indeed.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.004
The guy was kind of a jerk,
though, right?

22:19.379 --> 22:20.964
- Completely.
- I'm not that dumb!

22:28.555 --> 22:31.266
Looking for a place
the whole family can enjoy?

22:31.349 --> 22:33.143
Come on down to Luxia's Kingdom.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.354
Ride a seahorse.
Feed Swirn's jellyfish.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.982
You can take a dip
in our new volcanic hot springs

22:39.066 --> 22:41.526
or see the hypnotic Octodancers perform

22:41.610 --> 22:45.739
while snacking on treats
from Plaxum's bakery and lots more!

22:45.822 --> 22:50.285
Luxia's Kingdom, so safe and warm,
you'll wanna stay forever.
