00:02.358 --> 00:07.117
'Officer of the year, Detective
Chief Inspector Anthony Gates.'

00:10.202 --> 00:11.882
Flat 56.

00:14.802 --> 00:17.041
Welcome to Anti Corruption.
This will be good.

00:17.042 --> 00:18.682
Wasn't your fault, son.

00:21.682 --> 00:23.401
Hit and run? Why us?

00:23.402 --> 00:27.201
We've got a big sign over our heads
saying, "CID - dump your crap here".

00:27.202 --> 00:29.602
I'm sick of CID.
I want to join TO-20, Sir.

00:32.082 --> 00:34.841
I hit something.
What did you hit? A dog.

00:34.842 --> 00:36.321
'You killed a man.'

00:36.322 --> 00:37.361
Oh, my god!

00:37.362 --> 00:40.561
'The finger amputations are clean.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.921
'It was 10 minutes.'

00:41.922 --> 00:44.081
15 tops before
the next turn clocked on.

00:44.082 --> 00:46.001
It's big. It's sexy.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.642
Makes it mine, OK?

00:48.722 --> 00:51.761
'We're going to get Gates
with or without you, Steve.'

00:51.762 --> 00:54.922
Looks like you've found your level,
Arnott. Nobody plays me!

00:56.682 --> 00:58.881
Didn't know AC 12
used undercover officers.

00:58.882 --> 01:02.482
I wouldn't be risking it if I didn't
believe Gates was a special case.

01:03.842 --> 01:08.642
'Mr Patel was an accountant
for Laverty Holdings.'

01:12.242 --> 01:15.721
'I thought maybe you were clean.
Looks like you're dirty after all.'

01:15.722 --> 01:18.762
You take a shot at the king?
Make sure you kill him, son.

01:27.450 --> 01:30.450
Looks like there's still a turd
on the driver's seat.

01:33.570 --> 01:37.409
Best tell the boss he's here.
In a minute.

01:37.410 --> 01:42.249
DS Arnott. DCI Gates asked me to
escort you into the building.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.409
Arsehole.

01:44.410 --> 01:47.169
Fine.

01:47.170 --> 01:50.049
Tony Gates - best detective
in the city.

01:50.050 --> 01:55.169
You? You see someone getting results
and you have to bring him down.

01:55.170 --> 01:56.330
You're safe, then.

01:56.331 --> 02:01.129
I never worked hard enough.
Tony Gates has.

02:01.130 --> 02:03.889
He cares about solving crime.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.810
You done?

02:07.490 --> 02:08.810
Haven't finished me smoke yet.

02:11.970 --> 02:14.169
Shall we get a move on?

02:14.170 --> 02:15.970
Bollocks!

02:17.930 --> 02:21.849
Having a bit of a bad time.
All right, mate.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.289
DCI Gates, I bear a signed action

02:24.290 --> 02:27.450
assigning me access to TO-20 files.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.810
You're a bean counter.
How does that feel?

02:41.610 --> 02:44.090
Briefing room, please.

02:54.090 --> 02:58.969
OK. Greek Lane. Two unidentified IC6
males. Amputated fingers.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.369
Fingers were cut off while these
lads were still alive.

03:02.370 --> 03:04.689
Most likely with bolt-cutters

03:04.690 --> 03:07.209
and most likely to extract
information.

03:07.210 --> 03:11.289
Given the finger count, looks like
they didn't have much to say.
They gave the murderer the finger.

03:11.290 --> 03:13.009
Yeah, 20 times!

03:13.010 --> 03:15.530
Maybe it was a warning?
Well, it worked on these two.

03:17.450 --> 03:19.889
Right. Known dealer Wesley Duke,

03:19.890 --> 03:23.769
seen ingressing
and egressing the dwelling.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.970
The house became the subject
of a surveillance op.

03:25.971 --> 03:28.729
We're assuming the offenders
broke in via the window.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.409
The 15-minute window between
Deepak and Dot leaving

03:31.410 --> 03:33.169
and the next shift arriving.

03:33.170 --> 03:36.249
Yeah, I'm sorry about that, Tone.
Very sorry, sir.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.570
If we'd have stayed,
we'd have gone over the hour.

03:38.571 --> 03:41.170
They're all over us about
overtime, boss.

03:43.610 --> 03:47.569
So we make it up by nicking
whoever did it, right?

03:47.570 --> 03:49.729
Cheers, Tone.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.329
Well, all this makes Wesley Duke
our principal lead.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.370
Worth bringing him in?

03:53.371 --> 03:56.209
Oh, I've already had
uniform pick him up.

03:56.210 --> 03:57.970
Interview Room 1.

04:00.130 --> 04:03.809
Sir, I hope it's OK, but I'm just
going to go over our case load.

04:03.810 --> 04:04.890
Knock yourself out.

04:07.490 --> 04:10.810
I'll just be a minute, Nige.
Oh, don't mind me.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.890
'Interview under caution'

05:17.891 --> 05:20.489
of Wesley Duke by Detective Chief
Inspector Anthony Gates

05:20.490 --> 05:24.169
in the presence of Wesley's
solicitor, Lis Burton.

05:24.170 --> 05:27.009
You've both had the benefit
of disclosure, so you're aware

05:27.010 --> 05:29.410
that we have evidence
that Wesley was a frequent visitor

05:29.411 --> 05:32.689
of the house on Greek Lane.
Tell me what you were buying.

05:32.690 --> 05:35.249
Hard food? White boy?

05:35.250 --> 05:38.049
No, I was just borrowing some DVDs.

05:38.050 --> 05:39.569
I see.

05:39.570 --> 05:41.489
So, you would take away some DVDs,

05:41.490 --> 05:44.489
come back the next night
and what, borrow some more?

05:44.490 --> 05:48.049
That's correct. Disclosure
of evidence and four hours

05:48.050 --> 05:51.729
and this is the story
you've cooked up? All right.

05:51.730 --> 05:54.769
I would be very disappointed
if you couldn't tell me

05:54.770 --> 05:56.929
the titles of some of those DVDs.

05:56.930 --> 06:00.289
Iron Man 2. Kick-Ass. Piranha 3D,
except not in 3D.

06:00.290 --> 06:02.810
Yeah, all right, Wesley. Well done.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.249
But what I really want to know is,
those lads who were lending

06:07.250 --> 06:11.330
the DVDs, who were they and where
were they getting their DVDs from?

06:12.650 --> 06:15.330
They were just some lads
that was into DVDs, innit?

06:18.650 --> 06:22.769
Thing is, Wesley, those lads were
brutally murdered and you are

06:22.770 --> 06:25.929
the only person that we can connect
to that house.

06:25.930 --> 06:29.169
And that makes you prime suspect.
Mr Duke had nothing to do

06:29.170 --> 06:31.249
with the murder and you know it.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.889
Wesley, where were you
between the hours of 11pm

06:33.890 --> 06:36.530
on Wednesday the 4th
and 6am on Thursday the 5th?

06:38.650 --> 06:41.689
No comment.
No alibi offered at first interview.

06:41.690 --> 06:45.369
My line of inquirys? They're going
to hit you like a steamroller

06:45.370 --> 06:48.649
if you don't stop feeding me this
pack of porkies.

06:48.650 --> 06:51.169
My client strenuously
denies the allegation.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.849
You have no forensic evidence
as per disclosure.

06:53.850 --> 06:56.889
This is going to be a compensation
claim for wrongful arrest.

06:56.890 --> 06:57.890
Have him, Tone.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.210
OK.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.330
Interview terminated.

07:04.331 --> 07:07.009
Thank you very much, Wesley.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.970
You've been a great help.
What you mean?

07:08.971 --> 07:11.729
As a token of our gratitude
for the information you've provided,

07:11.730 --> 07:15.729
I'll have you returned home
in a marked police car.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.569
He'll thank you warmly
in front of the whole estate.

07:18.570 --> 07:20.929
Then I'll get our
community policing operations

07:20.930 --> 07:24.769
to make a blatant point
of turning a blind eye

07:24.770 --> 07:26.130
to all of your activities.

07:26.131 --> 07:28.489
He's just turned a ferret
into a rat.

07:28.490 --> 07:32.250
Whoa, whoa! My client is absolutely
not a police informer.

07:33.410 --> 07:34.530
So?

07:48.730 --> 07:53.089
Interview continued. How long were
they operating out of that house?

07:53.090 --> 07:54.809
Not long. A month, tops.

07:54.810 --> 07:56.369
And where were they from?

07:56.370 --> 07:59.209
Some Arabs or Muslims or something.

07:59.210 --> 08:03.369
What were their names, Wesley?
Ali... Ahmed... How am I supposed
to know?

08:03.370 --> 08:06.530
Do you know where were they getting
their supply? Of DVDs?

08:07.650 --> 08:09.649
They never said. They had loads.

08:09.650 --> 08:12.049
Good quality.
Not mixed up or nothing.

08:12.050 --> 08:15.929
All right. Now we're getting
somewhere. I need one more fact.

08:15.930 --> 08:19.530
Anything, Wesley.
Help me to help you out here.

08:20.810 --> 08:22.609
It came in some white sacks.

08:22.610 --> 08:24.769
They!
THEY came in some white sacks.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.089
Can I go now?

08:26.090 --> 08:27.689
No.

08:27.690 --> 08:30.449
Not with our paperwork.

08:30.450 --> 08:32.049
Interview terminated.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.610
Cheers.

08:38.570 --> 08:43.010
You'll be fine. This week
they're only into burglaries.

08:47.810 --> 08:50.249
Rita? Jackie Laverty.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.609
Oh! All yours.

08:53.610 --> 08:54.889
Thanks.

08:54.890 --> 08:57.689
Has DCI Gates called you in?

08:57.690 --> 08:59.569
DCI Gates?

08:59.570 --> 09:02.249
He's, er, taken over your case.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.890
If you come with me,
I'll see if he's available.

09:23.490 --> 09:25.730
Officer of the year.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.050
Ms Laverty, isn't it?

09:31.051 --> 09:35.449
Would you like to come into my
office, please. I'd be happy to.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.649
Thank you, Rita.

09:37.650 --> 09:39.290
You're welcome, sir.

09:52.130 --> 09:55.089
Can you leave the door open, please?

09:55.090 --> 09:56.689
Thank you.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.450
Have a seat.

10:03.530 --> 10:07.090
So I welcome this opportunity to
bring you up to speed, Miss Laverty.

10:09.450 --> 10:11.610
We're satisfied there was
a break-in at your home

10:11.611 --> 10:14.129
that enabled the thieves to steal
your vehicle.

10:14.130 --> 10:17.769
It was subsequently involved in a
fatal hit-and-run with a pedestrian.

10:17.770 --> 10:22.249
We've looked at identifying the
victim through Missing Persons.

10:22.250 --> 10:26.090
There was an individual who appeared
to match the deceased.

10:27.370 --> 10:30.449
However, that is no longer
an active line of enquiry.

10:30.450 --> 10:34.170
Your case remains open and unsolved.

10:43.570 --> 10:47.330
Just in case you think of
contacting me again.

10:52.290 --> 10:55.410
I hope that clarifies
the situation, Ms Laverty.

11:01.850 --> 11:03.290
I see.

11:17.290 --> 11:21.250
Rita? Could you show
Ms Laverty out, please?

11:41.050 --> 11:44.810
Steve? I just had a call from Kate.

11:47.970 --> 11:51.490
I skimmed the hit-and-run file, sir.
It's a red herring.

11:52.890 --> 11:55.569
Don't you think it's curious
that the Officer of the Year

11:55.570 --> 11:58.689
should be involving himself
in a hit-and-run incident?

11:58.690 --> 12:01.090
He knows we're on to him
and he's deliberately taken

12:01.091 --> 12:04.569
on a low-profile case with virtually
zero chance of clean-up.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.809
What I do have, sir,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.770
is a pattern of laddering
going back years.

12:09.771 --> 12:13.409
Gates selects an open-and-shut case
and bumps up additional charges.

12:13.410 --> 12:16.809
He's clearing four crimes for every
one that's actually committed.

12:16.810 --> 12:20.089
Tony Gates, eh?

12:20.090 --> 12:22.169
He's your bent copper
for the 21st century.

12:22.170 --> 12:26.169
Steve, when I first came over here,
there was ten bent coppers

12:26.170 --> 12:29.409
to every station - minimum.
We didn't put our house in order.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.690
These new procedures,
we brought them on ourselves.

12:31.691 --> 12:36.009
And Gates is using this messed-up
system to get to the top.

12:36.010 --> 12:38.969
But why, Steve? Why is he doing it?

12:38.970 --> 12:41.370
What's in this for him, hm?

12:56.250 --> 12:57.890
Hiya. Hey.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.569
Hi there, how you doing?

13:14.570 --> 13:18.610
The performance is just
there on the left.

14:05.890 --> 14:08.449
Medium latte? Thank you.

14:08.450 --> 14:10.129
What's your name? Nadzia.

14:10.130 --> 14:11.689
Hawaii Five-O.

14:11.690 --> 14:15.089
Could I ask you some
questions please, Nadzia?

14:15.090 --> 14:16.490
Should I ask for a lawyer first?

14:16.491 --> 14:19.689
Depends if you're a
criminal or not.

14:19.690 --> 14:23.130
I'm a very good person.
Then you'll be fine.

14:29.130 --> 14:32.170
Nadzia. N-A-D-Z-I-A.

14:33.410 --> 14:34.969
Surname?

14:34.970 --> 14:38.410
Wojcik. W-O-J-C-I-K.

14:41.410 --> 14:44.769
Last week, a police officer
was having breakfast here.

14:44.770 --> 14:48.009
There was a mugging outside and
he intervened. I remember.

14:48.010 --> 14:49.690
Does he regularly
receive free meals?

14:49.691 --> 14:52.089
No, he never came in before.

14:52.090 --> 14:55.609
Some officers make sure everyone
knows they're in the job.

14:55.610 --> 14:59.209
Fishing for special treatment.
They were quiet, no trouble.

14:59.210 --> 15:01.969
He was with someone?

15:01.970 --> 15:03.849
Yes.

15:03.850 --> 15:05.529
Another police officer?

15:05.530 --> 15:08.809
I don't know, but she didn't do
anything to stop the mugging

15:08.810 --> 15:09.849
like he did.

15:09.850 --> 15:11.289
A woman?

15:11.290 --> 15:13.330
Yes.

15:14.690 --> 15:16.969
Young? Old? Attractive?

15:16.970 --> 15:19.089
You mean do I think she was
his girlfriend?

15:19.090 --> 15:20.209
Was she?

15:20.210 --> 15:24.489
Is it a problem for policemen in
this country to have girlfriends?

15:24.490 --> 15:26.649
It depends who the girl is.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.609
She mustn't be a criminal?

15:28.610 --> 15:30.129
Exactly.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.170
Or a witness?

15:35.930 --> 15:39.889
Do you remember the woman well
enough to give me a description?

15:39.890 --> 15:43.089
Tall. Slim. Dark hair.

15:43.090 --> 15:46.170
Mid-forties. Well-dressed.

17:47.770 --> 17:50.529
So, your new boyfriend's
ex-girlfriend's been on Facebook,

17:50.530 --> 17:53.090
calling you a slag?
I want her done.

18:02.090 --> 18:04.969
I've got loads I could be doing!

18:04.970 --> 18:06.129
Excuse me.

18:06.130 --> 18:08.769
Control just picked up a silent
alarm going off at

18:08.770 --> 18:10.769
Kingsgate Canalside.

18:10.770 --> 18:13.170
I haven't even done her MG11 yet.
Audit'll be all over me.

18:13.171 --> 18:14.969
Where's Reynolds? Off sick.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.689
Peterson? On a course.

18:16.690 --> 18:19.290
Well, this is a CS.
You'll have to take the new boy.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.809
So, what's CS?

18:31.810 --> 18:35.729
Control Strategy Crime. This week
it's burglary - dwellings.

18:35.730 --> 18:37.570
Next week we'll be told
to ignore them.

18:42.530 --> 18:44.448
He's bound to have legged it by now.

18:44.449 --> 18:46.730
Yeah, but it's better give it
the once-over, though.

18:50.410 --> 18:53.890
For Christ's sake, Simon!
Risk assessment first!

19:15.250 --> 19:18.809
Whoa, whoa! Come on, mate.
Look, don't be a pillock.

19:18.810 --> 19:22.129
Get back! I'm warning you, get back!
The pair of you!

19:22.130 --> 19:25.889
I'll do it! I'm warning you!
He's on summat.

19:25.890 --> 19:30.690
Just... just stay calm, OK?
Look, you don't need to do this!

19:35.770 --> 19:39.410
That is so many more
forms to fill in.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.969
You didn't break his jaw
as well, did you, Kaz?

19:52.970 --> 19:56.050
Ha-ha! Be my guest, Sarge.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.649
Lee, I'm Detective
Sergeant Janson. Lee.

20:01.650 --> 20:02.810
Lee!

20:04.490 --> 20:07.169
What d'you want?

20:07.170 --> 20:11.489
Your offence today took place in one
of our control strategy hot spots.

20:11.490 --> 20:14.289
Unfortunately for you, that means
that when you're discharged

20:14.290 --> 20:16.809
we'll charge you
with the full force of the law.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.849
Oh, yeah, I'm having
a brilliant day!

20:18.850 --> 20:21.369
What will help you enormously
when it comes to sentencing,

20:21.370 --> 20:25.529
is if you agree for other offences
to be taken into consideration.

20:25.530 --> 20:28.849
TIC. Oh, nice one.
Yeah, I don't want prison.

20:28.850 --> 20:30.730
I've got Benidorm booked.

20:32.530 --> 20:36.169
There was a house burgled
in Edge Park. Yeah, I did that.

20:36.170 --> 20:37.689
Lock-up garages in Moss Heath.

20:37.690 --> 20:39.089
Yeah, that was me, yeah.

20:39.090 --> 20:42.689
A hairdresser's in Moss Heath?
Did that, yeah.

20:42.690 --> 20:44.569
House burglary in Edge Park.

20:44.570 --> 20:46.809
Burglary, another one in Moss Heath.
Moss Heath.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.329
Hotel in Borough Grove.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

20:49.330 --> 20:51.890
Shop in Borough Grove.
Shop Borough Grove, yeah.

21:00.730 --> 21:05.209
Outstanding work, Janson.
Right, thank you, sir.

21:05.210 --> 21:08.210
The Crime Audit Office
will be delighted.

21:10.450 --> 21:13.809
I look forward to that
automated e-mail!

21:13.810 --> 21:18.930
DC Fleming, interview room three,
when you're ready.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.009
Mr Butterfield,
please don't get up.

21:27.010 --> 21:29.889
I'm devastated by what's
happened to you.

21:29.890 --> 21:31.330
I know you're angry and upset.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.809
And you're entirely within
your rights to lodge a complaint.

21:34.810 --> 21:38.489
Well, I'm the last bloke who'd want
to say a bad word against the police.

21:38.490 --> 21:40.929
I believe you, sir.
And I've got some good news.

21:40.930 --> 21:44.009
We've arrested a burglar who
confessed to robbing your property.

21:44.010 --> 21:45.969
What, the one who attacked me?

21:45.970 --> 21:48.689
He didn't confess to that.

21:48.690 --> 21:52.169
Oh, well, it'll be the one from
before, the one who took my telly.

21:52.170 --> 21:55.089
Well, I can certainly look into it
for you, sir. Yeah?

21:55.090 --> 21:58.129
Mr Butterfield, I can see that
you don't want frontline officers

21:58.130 --> 22:00.969
tied to desks while your attacker's
still out there.

22:00.970 --> 22:02.930
You have no idea
of the hours, days,

22:02.931 --> 22:05.329
of admin required
to process a complaint.

22:05.330 --> 22:07.290
Give us the chance to work for you
instead.

22:12.250 --> 22:15.930
Thank you. Someone will be along
to see you shortly.

22:22.130 --> 22:26.809
Oh, hi, sir.
Hiya. I am going to talk to uniform.

22:26.810 --> 22:30.209
Put a priority on this bloke
the next time he triple-9's.

22:30.210 --> 22:33.729
Oh! Would you, sir?
You're part of my team now, Kate.

22:33.730 --> 22:36.769
Means I don't stand by
and let you carry something
like this on your own.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.770
Oh, thank you, sir.

22:47.450 --> 22:51.129
I see what the highest detection
rate in the region buys you.

22:51.130 --> 22:53.089
We'd better crack these murders

22:53.090 --> 22:55.730
or I'll be trading her in
for a Reliant Robin.

22:56.930 --> 23:00.969
Best job cars.
Best job phones and computers.

23:00.970 --> 23:03.809
It must've been hard
getting on this squad.

23:03.810 --> 23:07.810
For a while it was touch and go
whether I'd ever get out
from behind a desk.

23:12.410 --> 23:15.170
What happened, Nige,
if you don't mind me asking?

23:17.130 --> 23:18.570
I took a bullet for one of the lads.

23:21.850 --> 23:23.130
Really?

23:28.650 --> 23:32.330
You think about
throwing in the towel, retiring.

23:35.170 --> 23:39.249
Tony gave me back the motivation.
He's a good man.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.809
You remember that.

23:41.810 --> 23:43.890
Yeah.

23:53.530 --> 23:57.249
Wesley referred to a large supply
of drugs in little white sacks.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.169
Whoever killed them appears
to have stolen the stash.

24:00.170 --> 24:03.249
Maybe it's just really well hidden
and no-one's found it yet.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.449
I never saw your motor outside?

24:05.450 --> 24:08.929
It's parked across the street, Nige.
Oh?

24:08.930 --> 24:11.090
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

24:12.650 --> 24:13.810
I am, sir.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.410
Sir?

24:40.530 --> 24:43.329
Nothing. Bollocks.

24:43.330 --> 24:46.369
We'll find it.
Nige, get a search team in here.

24:46.370 --> 24:51.809
What, now or... Yeah, now, please.
Cheers, mate. All right.

24:51.810 --> 24:54.449
We'll need something sharp to
get the rest of these up.

24:54.450 --> 24:56.770
Well, we won't be able to use
Nige then, will we, sir?

24:58.170 --> 25:00.729
Slow but sure sometimes
wins the race, Kate.

25:00.730 --> 25:04.849
Did you bring me into
the squad for the same reason?
I'm not following you.

25:04.850 --> 25:08.889
Well, I'm more than just another
tick off the diversity box.

25:08.890 --> 25:12.049
Somebody said something
they shouldn't?

25:12.050 --> 25:14.769
It doesn't matter what
other people say. It's what you say.

25:14.770 --> 25:16.969
I say you're a good detective,

25:16.970 --> 25:20.850
which is rare seeing as no-one
bothers training you lot any more.

25:22.290 --> 25:24.890
But that's not the whole reason
you appointed me, is it?

25:27.530 --> 25:29.329
You're a good detective.

25:29.330 --> 25:32.489
Hilton's the one who cares
about ticking boxes.

25:32.490 --> 25:35.890
I care about cracking cases.
Yeah. Me too, sir.

25:57.250 --> 26:00.569
I need copies of all
the original documentation

26:00.570 --> 26:03.529
relating to a hit-and-run,
crime number G89635.

26:03.530 --> 26:05.810
Just get a photo.

26:12.930 --> 26:15.849
Do you think AC-12
have targets too?

26:15.850 --> 26:19.930
Cos that tosser's only going
to hit someone else's. Oh!

26:33.730 --> 26:36.169
Good day at the office, DCI Gates?

26:36.170 --> 26:38.289
One call and you're on
a harassment charge.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.170
Yeah, I could do the same
for your goons.

26:40.171 --> 26:42.169
If you want to talk to me, Arnott,

26:42.170 --> 26:45.809
call me into AC-12, we'll do
it in front of my federation rep.

26:45.810 --> 26:47.929
Why bother when
I'm only after a minor detail?

26:47.930 --> 26:50.329
The reason you took over
a hit-and-run.

26:50.330 --> 26:53.329
I mean, it's hardly
officer of the year material.

26:53.330 --> 26:57.649
It may harm your defence, if you do
not mention when questioned...

26:57.650 --> 26:59.849
I expect you know the rest.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.689
I received information
that the incident in question

27:02.690 --> 27:05.809
was connected to one of my team's
ongoing investigations.

27:05.810 --> 27:09.369
That information was wrong.
You haven't bounced
it back to Traffic yet?

27:09.370 --> 27:13.289
Hey! I am the senior investigating
officer on a double murder.

27:13.290 --> 27:17.210
That is proper policing, son.
Maybe you remember it?

27:22.570 --> 27:24.490
I'll wait for those documents,
thank you.

27:40.330 --> 27:42.929
He could feel
his grandfather's spirit

27:42.930 --> 27:45.049
reaching out across the years,

27:45.050 --> 27:47.569
urging him to take
the first big step.

27:47.570 --> 27:52.369
Scott took a deep breath
and then he said for all to hear,

27:52.370 --> 27:57.130
"I'm ready." OK, bedtime, please.

27:58.130 --> 28:00.169
Can't we have another story?

28:00.170 --> 28:02.329
No, no, I'll be reading
all night. Go.

28:02.330 --> 28:03.609
Just one...

28:03.610 --> 28:05.450
No, darling,
it's time for bed. Let's go.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.209
Thank you.

28:09.210 --> 28:11.929
Daddy. Yep?
Can I have a drink?

28:11.930 --> 28:13.890
You've brushed your teeth
so only water.

28:13.891 --> 28:15.850
I don't like water.

28:17.650 --> 28:18.970
Go to sleep, please.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.090
Good night, guys.

28:42.010 --> 28:44.529
I'm sorry about going along
with the banter today.

28:44.530 --> 28:45.690
I don't give a toss.

28:45.691 --> 28:48.329
What pisses me off is going
to Hastings behind my back.

28:48.330 --> 28:52.169
Every piece of information
I feed you risks blowing my cover.

28:52.170 --> 28:55.289
Well, I did get into the hit-and-run,
in my own way.

28:55.290 --> 28:59.409
The vehicle was reported stolen by
Jackie Laverty, a property developer.

28:59.410 --> 29:02.689
She came to the station.
They talked.

29:02.690 --> 29:03.888
Something felt odd.

29:03.889 --> 29:05.170
During Breakfastgate,

29:05.171 --> 29:09.249
Gates was with a woman in the cafe,
described as tall, slim, dark hair.

29:09.250 --> 29:10.690
You think she's his girlfriend?

29:10.691 --> 29:12.849
Well, she doesn't appear in
his statement.

29:12.850 --> 29:14.330
She isn't named as a witness.

29:14.331 --> 29:16.889
Suppose Jackie Laverty is Gates'
bit on the side.

29:16.890 --> 29:18.929
She goes to him,
damsel in distress...

29:18.930 --> 29:21.929
And needs him to make sure no-one
challenges her alibi.

29:21.930 --> 29:24.170
Minimum, that's perverting
the course of justice.

29:24.171 --> 29:25.969
Anything on the victim?

29:25.970 --> 29:29.289
No, no ID yet.
I'm going to start working on it.

29:29.290 --> 29:31.130
And getting everything on her.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.130
OK.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.250
'Night. Yeah. See you.

30:06.250 --> 30:09.849
Is everything OK?
Yeah. She just had a bad dream.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.530
But she's off now.

30:17.890 --> 30:21.250
I'm so proud of you today,
well done, sweetheart.

30:25.210 --> 30:28.729
Do you want a cup of tea?
Yeah. Just, give me five.

30:28.730 --> 30:29.770
OK.

31:35.610 --> 31:38.530
Hello.
'I didn't think you'd pick up.

31:41.490 --> 31:43.369
'I had a message all prepared.

31:43.370 --> 31:48.330
'I was... I was going to say
how sorry I was about coming
to the station.

31:51.330 --> 31:53.610
'I had to see you, Tony.'

31:55.090 --> 31:58.329
That bloke, the one that jumped out
in front of your car

31:58.330 --> 31:59.849
on the dark country lane,

31:59.850 --> 32:03.050
he just happened to be your bloody
accountant, did he?

32:04.850 --> 32:07.409
For Christ's sake, Jackie!

32:07.410 --> 32:11.130
'Let me explain, please.'
Yeah. What do you take me for?

32:17.050 --> 32:19.650
'Having you back in my life
after all these years...

32:21.330 --> 32:24.130
'Now I'm losing you
all over again.

32:26.650 --> 32:30.130
'You're all I think about.

32:31.770 --> 32:34.610
'I'm thinking about you now, Tony.

32:38.290 --> 32:42.210
'I'm thinking about
what I let you do to me.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.650
'Are you thinking about
what I let you do?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.850
'You know I'd do anything you ask.

32:55.530 --> 33:00.810
'Anything. Nothing's off limits
for you and me, Tony. Nothing.

33:04.570 --> 33:06.610
'I know what we do is wrong.

33:11.730 --> 33:16.770
'I wish you were here,
inside me right now.

33:18.370 --> 33:19.770
'Nothing else compares.

33:22.130 --> 33:25.449
'I'd die if we ever had to stop.

33:25.450 --> 33:28.530
'Oh, I wish you were here now,
Tony.'

33:35.410 --> 33:36.450
I am.

33:59.530 --> 34:02.130
I was giving Gurjit a lift home.

34:06.210 --> 34:10.369
I started telling him about my plans
to expand

34:10.370 --> 34:13.449
and that he wasn't in those plans.

34:15.770 --> 34:21.089
He flipped. I thought he was
going to attack me.

34:21.090 --> 34:23.449
I-I panicked, Tony.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.409
I-I never meant to hurt him.
Why would I?

34:32.804 --> 34:34.043
Tony, please.

34:38.804 --> 34:41.284
This is why I came to see you.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.804
No-one else would believe me.

34:50.244 --> 34:51.884
Only you.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.324
Only my love.

35:08.724 --> 35:10.883
I'm being investigated.

35:10.884 --> 35:12.163
Because of me?

35:12.164 --> 35:14.683
Maybe.

35:14.684 --> 35:17.644
No-one knows, do they?

35:19.884 --> 35:21.323
No.

35:21.324 --> 35:22.964
Not even your wife.

35:30.204 --> 35:31.763
No.

35:31.764 --> 35:38.084
Tony, the last thing I want is
for this to hurt you or your family.

35:44.204 --> 35:46.724
I understand if I can never
see you again.

36:39.324 --> 36:42.604
Woah!
Welcome to the Borogrove Estate.

36:45.884 --> 36:47.963
Why aren't these kids in school?

36:47.964 --> 36:50.043
Where have you been
the last 20 years?

36:50.044 --> 36:52.923
What, we've surrendered the streets?
For once, we're on 'em.

36:52.924 --> 36:54.244
Try and enjoy it, mate.

37:15.924 --> 37:17.804
You want a coffee, coffin dodger?

37:18.844 --> 37:21.164
Show your face. Stupid old wanker.

37:22.444 --> 37:25.203
Fuck off!

37:25.204 --> 37:29.723
Oh! That's disgusting!
Go on, Ryan. Do it!

37:29.724 --> 37:33.404
You said I could call and you'd send
someone round straightaway.

37:39.284 --> 37:42.404
Agh! Jesus.

37:50.004 --> 37:52.203
Woah, where you get those trainers,
blud?

37:52.204 --> 37:55.043
Get lost, rude boy.
Woah, Wesley.

37:55.044 --> 37:57.203
Have some blud clart respect!

37:57.204 --> 37:59.043
Woah, woah, woah, chill, man.

37:59.044 --> 38:02.563
Tom wants to speak to you.

38:02.564 --> 38:03.684
Hello. 'Arsehole!'

38:03.685 --> 38:04.923
Yo, Tommy.

38:04.924 --> 38:08.443
'Dealing with them Arabs.'
Yo, Tom, I'd never disrespect you.

38:08.444 --> 38:12.283
'Them Arabs lost their fingers!
You give the kid your score.

38:12.284 --> 38:15.804
'If it doesn't get to me by tonight,
you'll go the same way they did.'

38:28.524 --> 38:31.524
Wanker! I phoned them.
They'll have the lot of you!

38:33.972 --> 38:35.611
Your house smells better

38:35.612 --> 38:37.971
now it don't smell of piss,
you old bastard.

38:37.972 --> 38:41.132
Hey!

38:45.452 --> 38:49.211
Enough! Enough!
Oi, get off him. Get back.

38:49.212 --> 38:52.651
Calm down. Oi, calm down.
He fucking whacked me.

38:52.652 --> 38:54.491
He got what was coming.

38:54.492 --> 38:58.731
I want him done for whacking me
and for fucking swearing and that.

38:58.732 --> 39:02.131
I never assaulted him.
I just walloped him, that's all.

39:02.132 --> 39:04.531
You stupid old bastard.
Shut up, you!

39:04.532 --> 39:07.331
Mr Butterfield, I'm very sorry,
but I've no choice but under

39:07.332 --> 39:10.491
guidelines stipulated
in the Public Order Act,

39:10.492 --> 39:13.611
I must arrest you for assault.
Turn your pockets out. Kaz, really?!

39:13.612 --> 39:17.651
Oi! Get back to the vehicle!

39:17.652 --> 39:20.491
What the hell are you playing at,
Simon? This is the Bog.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.492
We don't ever leave the vehicle.

40:23.572 --> 40:25.971
Early! Idiot!

40:25.972 --> 40:29.971
Are you the proprietor
of this hairdressing business, sir?

40:29.972 --> 40:33.531
Manager. Not chief stylist?

40:33.532 --> 40:35.811
What do you want?

40:35.812 --> 40:39.091
I'm following up on a burglary
that occurred some weeks ago.

40:39.092 --> 40:43.251
I understand these premises
are owned by Laverty Holdings. Sure.

40:43.252 --> 40:46.971
Do you know Ms Laverty?
She's the owner?

40:46.972 --> 40:50.611
Blonde, big lady.

40:50.612 --> 40:54.211
That's her. Anything else?

40:54.212 --> 40:56.652
No.

41:10.252 --> 41:11.932
Deepak.

41:24.332 --> 41:27.372
So what's the twat been up to?

41:29.212 --> 41:30.771
Deepak?

41:30.772 --> 41:35.011
I'm a little bit nervous
about spying, sir, on AC.

41:35.012 --> 41:36.411
Of course you are.

41:36.412 --> 41:39.891
And that's why I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

41:39.892 --> 41:43.131
Cos we're all in this together.
Not exactly, sir.

41:43.132 --> 41:45.972
You mean he's my problem
and mine alone?

41:47.492 --> 41:48.571
I mean...

41:48.572 --> 41:53.251
Cos we're a team, Deepak, and that
should mean something to you.

41:53.252 --> 41:54.571
Of course it does, sir.

41:54.572 --> 41:57.371
Cos if you want out, son,
there's plenty in line.

41:57.372 --> 42:00.851
He was checking out a hairdresser's
on the Bog, sir.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.212
It's a burglary TIC.

42:04.332 --> 42:07.012
That's it? Yeah.

42:10.652 --> 42:12.052
Is something wrong, sir?

42:15.812 --> 42:18.091
No, it's all good.

42:18.092 --> 42:20.692
Cheers, mate.

42:48.972 --> 42:53.171
These units are available right now,
yes? Absolutely, yes.

42:53.172 --> 42:54.531
We've got the cash flow

42:54.532 --> 42:57.692
for immediate uptake for 15 per cent
off the asking price.

42:59.492 --> 43:01.211
15?

43:01.212 --> 43:04.851
Mark, could you find out what that
gentleman in the suit wants?

43:04.852 --> 43:07.651
You already have four units
at a discounted price...

43:07.652 --> 43:09.051
Can I help you, mate?

43:09.052 --> 43:12.131
Yes, but don't you think
that gives me a bit more leverage

43:12.132 --> 43:13.571
for some understanding?

43:13.572 --> 43:17.371
Excuse me. Could you just give me
a moment, please?

43:17.372 --> 43:19.532
Mark, it's OK. It's all right.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.691
Ms Laverty? Yes.

43:24.692 --> 43:26.491
Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott.

43:26.492 --> 43:29.571
You're here to declare an interest
in commercial units?

43:29.572 --> 43:34.331
How can I help you?
You must be doing well for yourself,
given the economic climate.

43:34.332 --> 43:37.971
We've made shrewd investments.

43:37.972 --> 43:41.851
60 billion quid. Excuse me?

43:41.852 --> 43:45.371
Estimated annual revenue
from white-collar crime.

43:45.372 --> 43:47.371
20 times the cost
of conventional robbery.

43:47.372 --> 43:49.771
Am I being accused of something?

43:49.772 --> 43:52.731
A month ago, your hairdressing
business in Moss Heath was burgled.

43:52.732 --> 43:54.611
We only own those premises.

43:54.612 --> 43:58.811
The business operating there is
an independent commercial entity.

43:58.812 --> 44:00.811
Well, when I questioned him
earlier today,

44:00.812 --> 44:02.771
the manager of the salon indicated

44:02.772 --> 44:06.411
there was a direct business
relationship with you personally.

44:06.412 --> 44:10.051
He didn't seem to know you from Adam.
Why should he know me?

44:10.052 --> 44:13.211
That's true, you have dozens
of these places, don't you?

44:13.212 --> 44:16.651
And today you appear to be taking
an interest in market units?

44:16.652 --> 44:20.371
Maybe you'd like to discuss this
somewhere less public?

44:20.372 --> 44:23.171
I'm very happy to cooperate with
your investigation,

44:23.172 --> 44:25.291
but as this is a commercially
sensitive area,

44:25.292 --> 44:28.371
I'd prefer my solicitor was present
to verify all the small details.

44:28.372 --> 44:30.772
Are you familiar with the term
"captive business"?

44:30.773 --> 44:34.331
Services paid for in cash
with no paper trail or ID.

44:34.332 --> 44:37.451
Earnings from illegal activities
can be hidden

44:37.452 --> 44:39.571
through the books of salons,
market stalls etc.

44:39.572 --> 44:42.371
All the money goes to
the bank and bingo, it's clean.

44:42.372 --> 44:47.011
I'm in the middle of a meeting...
Laundered money finds
its way back to criminal interests

44:47.012 --> 44:50.531
while the launderer takes his cut,
or hers.

44:50.532 --> 44:53.891
Like I said, I'm happy to cooperate.

44:53.892 --> 44:57.972
As you were when your stolen vehicle
was used in a hit-and-run. Yes.

44:59.772 --> 45:03.931
The officer in charge of that case,
Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates.

45:03.932 --> 45:05.731
D'you know him?

45:05.732 --> 45:08.291
I met him briefly
at the police station.

45:08.292 --> 45:10.891
That's the extent
of your relationship?

45:10.892 --> 45:13.451
See, I have a witness to your
breakfast in Kingsgate

45:13.452 --> 45:15.532
the morning before
your car was stolen.

45:18.212 --> 45:21.571
Ms Laverty, you'll attend
Anticorruption Unit 12,

45:21.572 --> 45:24.411
located at this address,
with your solicitor at 9am tomorrow

45:24.412 --> 45:26.851
to be interviewed
under police caution

45:26.852 --> 45:30.811
by myself and my superior,
Superintendent Hastings.

45:30.812 --> 45:33.691
If you do not have a solicitor,
one will be appointed for you.

45:33.692 --> 45:35.372
I'm not arresting you at this time,

45:35.373 --> 45:38.531
but if you fail to attend, a warrant
will be issued for your arrest.

45:38.532 --> 45:40.812
Do you understand, Ms Laverty?

46:16.052 --> 46:17.452
What's going on?

46:18.572 --> 46:19.692
Let's talk outside.

46:21.932 --> 46:25.131
The coroner's set the date
to reopen the inquest
in the Karim Ali shooting.

46:25.132 --> 46:28.491
You're going to be asked to testify.
Only to be expected.

46:28.492 --> 46:31.972
But the firearms officers
are revisiting their statements.

46:33.412 --> 46:35.412
They're saying you sent them
to the wrong flat.

46:38.452 --> 46:39.692
I'm fighting your corner,

46:39.693 --> 46:44.332
but this can't not affect your
position here, Steve.

48:08.252 --> 48:10.971
I thought we were going over
the Greek Lane files again, sir?

48:10.972 --> 48:13.771
We'll do it tomorrow. Yeah, well,
what about the duty super?

48:13.772 --> 48:16.332
Did you get her to sign off
on the extra forensics?

48:38.332 --> 48:42.331
You're a lying bitch.
Arnott's onto you.

48:42.332 --> 48:43.412
I don't know how.

48:43.413 --> 48:47.171
The hairdressers, Jackie.
The flea-pit over at Moss Heath.

48:47.172 --> 48:51.051
You might as well have hung up
a sign saying,
"Launder your drug money here."

48:51.052 --> 48:53.331
You stupid bloody bitch.
Please, listen to me.

48:53.332 --> 48:55.851
The accountant found out about it,
didn't he? Tony...

48:55.852 --> 48:57.531
No, he saw the dirty money

48:57.532 --> 48:59.611
going through the books
and he decided to talk.

48:59.612 --> 49:03.891
So you lured him out to the country
and then you ran the poor bugger
over, didn't you? Tony...

49:03.892 --> 49:06.651
I'm not some 25-year-old
that's wet behind the ears.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.971
That was the sap that fell
for all your lies.

49:08.972 --> 49:10.731
They weren't lies. I loved Andrew.

49:10.732 --> 49:12.491
No. You loved his money, Jackie.

49:12.492 --> 49:17.052
Look, I know that I've hurt you.
But haven't I made it up to you?

49:23.012 --> 49:28.011
Jacqueline Laverty, I'm arresting
you for manslaughter. No, Tony...

49:28.012 --> 49:29.571
that may harm your defence

49:29.572 --> 49:32.571
if you do not mention when
questioned... You're hurting me!!

49:32.572 --> 49:35.091
Something that you later
rely on in court.

49:35.092 --> 49:37.331
Don't do this, please.

49:37.332 --> 49:40.171
May be used in
evidence against you.

49:40.172 --> 49:43.051
No, no, no. No, please don't do
this! Please don't do this.

49:43.052 --> 49:44.492
No, please don't do this.

49:44.493 --> 49:46.291
This is happening, Jackie, OK?

49:46.292 --> 49:48.972
Please don't do this,
please don't... Come on.

50:18.732 --> 50:24.171
I never told you.
He questioned me today.

50:24.172 --> 50:25.331
DS Arnott.

50:25.332 --> 50:30.611
He's putting it all together, but
it's you he's after, Tony, not me.

50:30.612 --> 50:32.572
I was on a dark lane
in fear of my life.

50:34.212 --> 50:39.612
I'll be acquitted, I'll be free,
but you, you'll go to prison.

50:43.052 --> 50:45.571
What's that like, Tony,
for a policeman?

50:45.572 --> 50:50.531
On the special wing, with all
the psychos and the paedophiles.

50:50.532 --> 50:52.092
It's never going to happen.

51:05.012 --> 51:10.532
Your wife will know about us.
Your daughters.

51:18.732 --> 51:20.332
What will they think of their daddy?

51:22.092 --> 51:23.492
Don't talk about my kids.

51:26.412 --> 51:28.772
It's not your future or mine -
it's theirs.

51:35.772 --> 51:37.652
Tony...

51:40.172 --> 51:41.572
Poor baby.

51:43.292 --> 51:45.412
I can fix this.

51:47.492 --> 51:49.692
We'll fix it. Leave it to me.

52:12.132 --> 52:14.411
'DS Arnott,
please leave a number and a message

52:14.412 --> 52:15.852
'and I'll call you back.'

52:15.853 --> 52:18.091
Steve, it's me.
Something's happened.

52:18.092 --> 52:20.651
Gates went off in a weird mood
earlier.

52:20.652 --> 52:22.651
No-one knows where he is.

52:22.652 --> 52:26.531
I can't track him down
without raising suspicions.

52:26.532 --> 52:28.332
Call me when you get this, Steve.

53:11.172 --> 53:14.771
That's the wanker. He's the one
who wouldn't give over his score.

53:14.772 --> 53:16.851
Oi!

53:16.852 --> 53:18.652
Wanker!

53:24.492 --> 53:27.571
Right, let's clear the area.

53:27.572 --> 53:30.171
Home now, girls. These kids
shouldn't be looking at this.

53:30.172 --> 53:32.971
They should be in bed.
Jesus, it's a school night.

53:32.972 --> 53:36.691
Keely? What? You never came in
for that follow-up interview.

53:36.692 --> 53:40.611
Ain't bothered 'bout that slag any
more. You're dropping the charges?

53:40.612 --> 53:42.931
Hey, result.
Result my arse.

53:42.932 --> 53:46.531
It's a six-page form to convert it
to a non-crime crime number.

53:46.532 --> 53:48.732
Home, now!

53:51.732 --> 53:54.532
He must've made one hell
of a racket.

53:56.412 --> 53:58.011
Any of you lot see anything?

53:58.012 --> 53:59.412
No. Piss off...

54:00.732 --> 54:02.931
Yeah, thought not.

54:02.932 --> 54:04.691
Well, we know who killed him.

54:04.692 --> 54:06.731
The same outfit that killed
the two dealers.

54:06.732 --> 54:09.091
Have you called Tony?

54:09.092 --> 54:11.372
Left a message on his mobile.
I'll call him at home.

54:11.373 --> 54:14.171
Easy. We don't want to go
waking his missus now, do we?

54:14.172 --> 54:17.091
Are you kidding? No, I'm not.

54:17.092 --> 54:19.371
Right, let's just
break these lot up.

54:19.372 --> 54:21.571
They're more likely to talk
on the QT.

54:21.572 --> 54:23.131
Jonesy, give us a hand.

54:23.132 --> 54:26.212
Come on, everyone,
that's about enough for one night.

54:29.492 --> 54:32.971
This is the most entertainment
we have.

54:32.972 --> 54:35.412
Don't do that.

54:41.572 --> 54:45.731
Arnott. Oh, for Christ's sake,
Steve, where are you?

54:45.732 --> 54:48.731
I think Dot and Morton
are covering for Gates.

54:48.732 --> 54:52.052
He's got to be at Jackie Laverty's
right now. Get over there.

54:58.532 --> 55:01.611
I'm sorry. I, I can't do this.

55:01.612 --> 55:04.252
You're a witness. I'm sorry.

55:30.972 --> 55:33.092
This is for the best, Tony.

55:35.492 --> 55:37.412
We get to keep seeing each other.

55:45.172 --> 55:48.611
Maybe you shouldn't have any more.

55:48.612 --> 55:50.852
It'll be morning soon.

55:59.332 --> 56:00.692
Let's go back upstairs.

56:11.732 --> 56:13.372
Did you hear the security gate?

56:26.412 --> 56:30.532
You should see who it is.
Keep them busy.

56:32.212 --> 56:33.892
I'm going to head out the back.

56:38.412 --> 56:43.371
Oh no, no, Tony, Tony!

56:43.372 --> 56:45.091
Oi! I'm a police...

56:45.092 --> 56:47.892
Oh no, no, please.
