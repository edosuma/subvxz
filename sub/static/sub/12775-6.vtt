00:02.297 --> 00:04.297
Guys, gather round. I have
an announcement to make.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.364
As you know, I've been
working on a new app.

00:08.369 --> 00:10.155
The app is called "Selfie-Control."

00:10.161 --> 00:12.530
It automatically curates
users' photos with an algorithm

00:12.536 --> 00:14.304
to let them know which ones
are gonna be most liked.

00:14.309 --> 00:16.509
Oh, that's easy.

00:16.515 --> 00:18.334
Any photo with you shirtless.

00:19.473 --> 00:21.834
Or any photo with you not in it.

00:23.072 --> 00:25.345
Now, as you know, I tend to get
a little nervous before a launch,

00:25.350 --> 00:27.503
- so I decided I need...
- A massage!

00:27.509 --> 00:29.557
- Grilled cheese!
- Ooh, some weed!

00:32.634 --> 00:34.389
Every great man has a sidekick.

00:34.395 --> 00:35.879
Batman had Robin,

00:35.885 --> 00:37.339
Sherlock had Watson,

00:37.345 --> 00:39.040
and I, Josh Kaminski, have...

00:39.046 --> 00:40.246
(All) Me!

00:41.041 --> 00:42.355
Randall!

00:42.361 --> 00:44.130
Meet Randall, my new assistant.

00:44.136 --> 00:46.874
He went to an Ivy League school
and is destined for big things.

00:46.988 --> 00:48.829
Hello, fellow employees.

00:50.589 --> 00:53.304
I wish I had time to socialize, but
we should really all get back to work.

00:53.309 --> 00:55.242
[laughter]

00:55.808 --> 00:57.129
Oh, he's serious.

00:57.899 --> 00:59.806
- Tick-tock, Josh.
- Great to meet you!

00:59.812 --> 01:01.376
- Pleasure!
- Welcome! He's weird.

01:01.382 --> 01:02.721
- Very.
- Oh, my damn.

01:24.419 --> 01:27.311
I don't know why they put
labels on these cleaning products

01:27.317 --> 01:29.484
telling you not to breathe in the fumes.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.943
That's the best part.

01:32.904 --> 01:34.317
Excuse me.

01:34.826 --> 01:37.482
- What are you doing?
- Taking out Josh's trash.

01:37.488 --> 01:40.108
I told you yesterday that that's my job.

01:40.114 --> 01:42.896
Now, keep your hands off my
trash before I beat your ass.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.058
I would, but as Josh's assistant,

01:48.064 --> 01:49.981
I can't let him work in filth.

01:50.635 --> 01:51.835
Oh, oh!

01:52.622 --> 01:54.997
Look at that guy doing my job for me.

01:55.788 --> 01:56.988
Why do I hate him?

01:58.317 --> 02:01.073
Yolanda, it's a big change to
have somebody new in the apartment.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.507
You remember my first day here.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.485
Hell no, I was drunk.

02:06.587 --> 02:07.935
No one talk to me today.

02:07.941 --> 02:09.955
I've got to get a press
release out for Josh's new app.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.295
I already sent it from your computer.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.955
So you can check that
off your to-do list.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.153
You went on my computer, in my office?

02:15.159 --> 02:17.356
Mm, technically, it's Josh's computer,

02:17.362 --> 02:20.962
in his penthouse, and he told me to
do it, so... kind of just doing my job.

02:20.968 --> 02:22.931
- And mine.
- And mine.

02:23.133 --> 02:25.798
You guys, he's just trying to
impress Josh. Okay? He's not

02:25.804 --> 02:27.806
- trying to take your jobs away.
- Stop.

02:28.258 --> 02:29.470
I'll take that tray.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.731
And, um, no more grilled cheese.

02:31.737 --> 02:33.900
This is a penthouse, not a trailer park.

02:36.107 --> 02:37.307
[murmuring]

02:37.313 --> 02:38.679
You guys!

02:38.685 --> 02:41.314
[sighs] Randall just
totally cook-blocked me.

02:42.489 --> 02:43.855
We've got to get rid of him.

02:43.861 --> 02:46.329
Trust me, I know these
number-crunching types.

02:46.335 --> 02:48.481
It's only a matter of time
before he convinces Josh,

02:48.487 --> 02:50.387
he doesn't need a full-time publicist.

02:50.393 --> 02:52.351
- Or a housekeeper.
- Or a personal chef.

02:52.357 --> 02:54.823
Who the hell needs a personal
chef five days a week?

02:55.253 --> 02:57.129
Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?

02:57.315 --> 02:58.580
I got it.

02:58.586 --> 03:00.952
If Josh sees sparks
between you and Randall,

03:00.958 --> 03:02.297
he'll get rid of him.

03:02.442 --> 03:03.827
Precious is right.

03:04.478 --> 03:07.856
I bet if you flirt with
Randall right in front of Josh,

03:07.862 --> 03:10.190
he'll get so jealy he'll fire him.

03:10.196 --> 03:12.751
I don't know, you guys. I mean,
I'm just back to work here.

03:12.757 --> 03:15.602
Josh and I are finally friends. I
don't know if I want to jeopardize it.

03:15.993 --> 03:17.276
What a surprise.

03:17.282 --> 03:19.249
Lollygagging in the laundry room.

03:20.124 --> 03:23.366
Gabi, Josh has been asking for
his smoothie for five minutes.

03:23.372 --> 03:25.574
You know what? I got it.

03:26.647 --> 03:27.917
I'm in.

03:32.537 --> 03:34.133
Ooh!

03:34.139 --> 03:36.540
You look like a fancy prostitute.

03:37.569 --> 03:39.569
- You must have a date.
- Uh-huh.

03:39.575 --> 03:41.234
And it's Josh's new assistant.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.671
He asked you out?

03:42.677 --> 03:45.767
Uh, no, I asked him. You
know how shy guys are.

03:45.773 --> 03:48.827
You gotta be a little more
forward, smile more, laugh harder,

03:48.833 --> 03:51.607
and, you know, when that doesn't work,
you just corner them and ask them out.

03:51.612 --> 03:54.709
Oh, maybe I can weave
this into my article.

03:54.715 --> 03:56.231
- Oh, what article?
- Well, I'm writing

03:56.236 --> 03:58.833
a freelance dating article for
that relationship blog called...

03:58.839 --> 04:00.518
"Posting and Ghosting."

04:01.624 --> 04:03.863
But you're not dating, you're all alone.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.676
Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna make
it up. It's called journalism, Gabi.

04:09.677 --> 04:11.817
- [loud music playing]
- [scoffs] It's starting again.

04:11.823 --> 04:15.163
I cannot think with this blaring music.

04:15.169 --> 04:17.810
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

04:18.649 --> 04:19.997
We have a broom?

04:20.551 --> 04:21.750
That's it.

04:21.757 --> 04:25.220
You bring the music, Lil'
So-So's gonna bring the beat.

04:26.769 --> 04:28.722
[loud music continues]

04:30.266 --> 04:31.466
[music stops]

04:31.472 --> 04:32.825
Hello, luv.

04:33.366 --> 04:34.572
Nice broom.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.696
Thanks. I came here to...

04:39.288 --> 04:41.138
Sweep you off your feet.

04:41.697 --> 04:45.078
What a relief. I thought you might
be here to complain about my music.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.704
[scoffs] More like complain
that it's not loud enough

04:47.710 --> 04:50.117
for this, uh, single, low-maintenance,

04:50.123 --> 04:52.006
totally disease-free girl to hear.

04:52.716 --> 04:55.437
It's my band. We just
moved here from the UK.

04:55.443 --> 04:56.788
- Oh.
- Hey.

04:56.794 --> 04:58.325
Since I'm new in town,

04:58.331 --> 04:59.968
how about showing me around tomorrow?

05:00.289 --> 05:01.489
Around when?

05:01.495 --> 05:02.695
Around eight?

05:03.639 --> 05:06.403
See you then. [chuckles] Cheers, mate.

05:06.409 --> 05:09.876
Not that we're mating, just dating.
Are we dating? See you at eight!

05:11.000 --> 05:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:20.103 --> 05:21.543
There she is.

05:21.549 --> 05:23.158
How was your date with Randall?

05:23.393 --> 05:26.208
Well, she's doing the walk
of shame in that outfit.

05:26.683 --> 05:28.523
These aren't the same
clothes I wore yesterday.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.244
I know, you should still be ashamed.

05:31.797 --> 05:35.426
Anyway, you guys would've been
so proud. I flirted my ass off.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.548
A batting of the eyes here and a
strategic touching of the arm there.

05:38.554 --> 05:40.212
He was putty in my hands.

05:40.747 --> 05:43.394
(Josh) Gabi, can you
please come in here?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.644
- It's almost too easy.
- Mm-hmm.

05:49.939 --> 05:51.139
Have a seat.

05:54.749 --> 05:57.265
Seems as though we have a situation.

05:57.279 --> 05:58.691
Oh.

05:58.697 --> 05:59.897
Do we?

06:01.320 --> 06:03.673
Randall, uh, he talked to me about you.

06:04.226 --> 06:05.535
Listen, Josh,

06:05.542 --> 06:08.817
if you're uncomfortable, and,
uh, you want to let him go,

06:08.823 --> 06:10.464
I understand.

06:11.462 --> 06:13.666
He said you sexually harassed him.

06:14.738 --> 06:16.561
What? No, I didn't do that.

06:16.567 --> 06:19.097
So you didn't keep asking him
out 12 times until he said yes.

06:19.103 --> 06:21.255
Hello, Josh, he said yes.

06:22.206 --> 06:24.426
He also said you were "handsy."

06:24.432 --> 06:26.711
Handsy? My hand never left his knee!

06:30.797 --> 06:33.516
[stomping]

06:33.522 --> 06:34.745
Hey, guys.

06:34.751 --> 06:36.329
Guess who's on the
verge of getting fired?

06:36.334 --> 06:37.534
- You.
- Yeah.

06:44.230 --> 06:48.272
"Whey protein, dried lentils,
cottage cheese." What is this?

06:48.278 --> 06:50.161
You reading. I'm shocked too.

06:52.231 --> 06:54.106
That's a shopping list from Randall.

06:54.112 --> 06:57.221
He said it's from Josh, and
that's what he wants in the fridge.

06:59.512 --> 07:02.346
And wait till you hear what
the little worm did to me.

07:02.352 --> 07:05.505
Oh, he had me clean all
the vents in the penthouse

07:05.511 --> 07:07.317
because Josh sneezed.

07:07.323 --> 07:09.224
They were filthy. Whoo!

07:09.717 --> 07:11.899
Somebody is not doing their job.

07:12.012 --> 07:13.811
Yeah, you.

07:14.009 --> 07:16.314
Whatever, I still hate Randall.

07:17.267 --> 07:19.200
Yeah, well, he suggested to Josh

07:19.206 --> 07:21.140
that I tweet every hour

07:21.146 --> 07:23.079
to build buzz for Josh's new app.

07:23.085 --> 07:24.820
Aren't you supposed to
be doing that anyway?

07:26.287 --> 07:27.900
Whatever. I still hate Randall.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.447
Hey, guys.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.837
Oh, hello.

07:33.843 --> 07:36.688
I'm so sorry. I don't mean to
make you feel uncomfortable.

07:44.013 --> 07:47.331
I'm glad you're all here
and appear to be on break.

07:47.702 --> 07:49.582
Guys, I just wanted to say, I'm sorry.

07:49.588 --> 07:51.432
I think I came on a little strong

07:51.437 --> 07:53.092
and I'd like to make it up to you.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.600
Drinks on me tonight?

07:54.814 --> 07:57.691
I'm sorry, I cannot socialize
with you according to LegalZoom.

07:59.472 --> 08:01.849
And I'm sorry, I have to wash my hair.

08:01.855 --> 08:04.717
And I have to wash...
whosever hair this is.

08:05.487 --> 08:06.839
Hey, no, no, no.

08:06.845 --> 08:10.042
Uh, Randall, they would love
to have drinks with you tonight.

08:10.048 --> 08:12.578
It sound likes a
really excellent "plan."

08:14.200 --> 08:16.786
Great! We can all leave
together right after work.

08:16.792 --> 08:18.076
Yay!

08:18.528 --> 08:19.731
What the hell was that?

08:19.737 --> 08:21.325
My plan. You guys are
gonna take Randall out,

08:21.330 --> 08:23.599
and you're gonna get him really, really
drunk. Then he misses work for days

08:23.604 --> 08:25.200
and Josh has to fire him. Okay?

08:25.206 --> 08:28.136
So, you have to go really hard. I'm
talking Valentine's Day no-date hard.

08:28.683 --> 08:30.331
That's genius.

08:30.337 --> 08:32.236
No one can out-drink Yolanda.

08:34.773 --> 08:36.443
Thanks, Elliot.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.317
Finally, a compliment.

08:42.446 --> 08:44.110
Ooh! Mm...

08:46.134 --> 08:47.334
Mmm!

08:47.711 --> 08:49.523
What am I making, you ask?

08:51.261 --> 08:54.153
Gabi, this is Upstairs Rick.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.713
Oh. You look a lot
different than you sound.

08:57.193 --> 08:58.411
Thanks, luv.

08:58.417 --> 09:00.250
He's British and in a band.

09:00.256 --> 09:01.540
He's magical.

09:02.438 --> 09:04.438
[rock music playing]

09:06.193 --> 09:08.193
New track. What do you think?

09:08.199 --> 09:09.709
It's killer!

09:10.074 --> 09:11.748
[whispers] It's killing me!

09:12.137 --> 09:13.560
I hate it.

09:13.566 --> 09:15.667
Well, you're gonna love me.

09:16.419 --> 09:20.573
Here. I use these every time
Josh talks about computery stuff.

09:21.324 --> 09:22.984
Bye, Upstairs Rick.

09:28.643 --> 09:29.843
Pop.

09:31.075 --> 09:32.275
Pop.

09:34.504 --> 09:37.315
Sofia, there's something
I want to ask you.

09:38.146 --> 09:43.413
[silence]

09:43.419 --> 09:44.725
[music plays again]

09:44.731 --> 09:50.144
[silence continuing]

09:50.150 --> 09:51.350
[music plays again]

09:52.355 --> 09:56.063
Come on, luv. Don't
make me beg. Yes or no?

09:56.069 --> 09:58.411
You want a yes or no to
the question you just asked?

09:58.417 --> 09:59.988
Come on, be a doll.

09:59.994 --> 10:02.266
Say yes. Please.

10:02.472 --> 10:04.065
Yes, please.

10:05.568 --> 10:08.181
I can't believe I finally
got a girl to agree to this.

10:09.158 --> 10:10.431
Neither can I.

10:10.437 --> 10:11.637
[chuckles]

10:21.451 --> 10:23.217
Oh, my God.

10:23.787 --> 10:25.812
There you guys are.
I was getting worried.

10:25.818 --> 10:27.471
Girl, don't get me started.

10:28.138 --> 10:30.421
After drinks, we took
Randall out dancing.

10:30.427 --> 10:31.837
Then to a party.

10:31.843 --> 10:33.098
Then to an after-party.

10:33.104 --> 10:34.606
Then to an after-after-party.

10:36.846 --> 10:39.997
[slurring] We drank everything.

10:41.751 --> 10:44.405
He's probably at home
throwing up right now.

10:45.108 --> 10:48.088
What are you guys talking about?
Randall's been here since six.

10:48.094 --> 10:50.712
He already sent out a press release
and cleaned up Josh's office.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.684
What? He's here?

10:53.863 --> 10:56.265
Then who the hell did we
drop off at his apartment?

10:57.951 --> 10:59.520
Hello, this is Randall.

11:00.138 --> 11:02.636
I told you not to call me here!

11:03.326 --> 11:06.964
I must still be drunk 'cause I'm
hearing Randall's voice in my head.

11:08.044 --> 11:11.014
And I must still be
drunk 'cause you look hot.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.220
[gasps]

11:12.950 --> 11:17.131
Okay. I'm sober and I'm hearing it
too because it's coming from that vent.

11:17.137 --> 11:18.337
[gasps]

11:18.715 --> 11:22.170
Damn. If I knew I could
hear private conversations,

11:22.176 --> 11:24.186
I would have cleaned
those vents out years ago.

11:24.192 --> 11:25.442
Shh!

11:25.448 --> 11:26.652
Shh!

11:26.658 --> 11:27.858
Shh!

11:27.864 --> 11:30.997
(Randall) Relax. He
doesn't suspect a thing.

11:31.003 --> 11:33.531
I'll be on my way as
soon as I get it. Goodbye!

11:35.004 --> 11:37.759
What is he getting
and where is he going?

11:37.765 --> 11:40.340
Wait, Elliot, do you still
have that thingy on your thingy?

11:40.574 --> 11:42.941
You mean GPS on my tablet?

11:43.699 --> 11:45.367
I speak stupid.

11:46.755 --> 11:50.637
Thank you. Now, we're going to
know exactly what he's up to.

11:51.727 --> 11:52.934
[clears throat]

11:52.940 --> 11:54.622
Oh, hey, guys.

11:54.628 --> 11:56.495
I'm sorry I ditched you at that party.

11:56.501 --> 11:58.997
If I'm not home by midnight,
my mom gets worried.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.845
Hey, Elliot.

12:00.851 --> 12:02.058
The beta version for my app

12:02.064 --> 12:03.838
is transferring onto a
flash drive right now.

12:03.844 --> 12:06.613
As soon as it's done, I need you to
take it to the corporate office...

12:06.619 --> 12:07.819
You been drinking?

12:09.541 --> 12:11.620
Maybe... a little.

12:14.347 --> 12:15.868
I can take it for you, Josh.

12:15.874 --> 12:17.509
Randall drank too!

12:17.527 --> 12:19.958
Ah, I did go out, but I don't drink.

12:19.964 --> 12:23.290
I only pretended to and poured
mine in a big black flowerpot.

12:23.763 --> 12:25.162
That was me, fool.

12:29.366 --> 12:31.219
Okay, look, as soon as
the drive finishes, I'll

12:31.225 --> 12:33.891
- give it to you and you can take it.
- No! Give it to me.

12:33.897 --> 12:35.201
I can do it, I swear.

12:35.936 --> 12:37.538
Okay. Fine.

12:37.544 --> 12:40.306
If you can spin around twice without
barfing, I'll let you take it.

12:41.568 --> 12:42.768
One...

12:42.774 --> 12:43.974
[gags]

12:49.161 --> 12:51.068
Last time I tracked someone,

12:51.074 --> 12:54.583
I found my husband at a motel
with his dental hygienist.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.831
Ironically, he was filling
one of her cavities.

13:00.264 --> 13:03.368
He's past Josh's corporate
office and is on the 101.

13:03.374 --> 13:05.844
[gasps] Maybe he's
headed to Silicon Valley.

13:05.850 --> 13:07.789
Where the tech companies are.

13:07.795 --> 13:09.555
And a really good Pinkberry.

13:10.486 --> 13:12.160
Oh, my God. Do you know what this means?

13:12.166 --> 13:15.902
Yeah, he's getting yogurt instead of
doing his job. We got him, you guys.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.343
Guys, I'm heading out...

13:19.732 --> 13:21.598
And my staff went home at three.

13:22.512 --> 13:24.446
- He's a spy!
- A liar!

13:24.452 --> 13:26.716
- We gotta stop him.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.557
Calm down. One at a time.
What's this all about?

13:29.563 --> 13:32.605
We found out bad things about
Randall. Bad, bad things.

13:32.611 --> 13:34.775
Randall didn't go to
your corporate office. No!

13:34.781 --> 13:37.213
He's headed to Silicon
Valley because he's...

13:39.087 --> 13:41.695
- Help!
- Oh, my God. Randall, what happened?

13:41.701 --> 13:44.334
I was walking to my car
when a black SUV pulled up

13:44.340 --> 13:45.650
and three guys jumped out.

13:45.656 --> 13:49.773
They asked if I worked for you and
when I proudly said yes, they jumped me.

13:50.573 --> 13:54.055
Damn, even when he's beat
senseless, he's a suck-up.

13:54.922 --> 13:56.879
I fought as hard as I could,

13:56.885 --> 13:59.157
but my yellow belt in karate failed me.

13:59.649 --> 14:02.629
They overpowered me
and took my backpack.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.945
But I didn't let them
get your flash drive.

14:05.781 --> 14:07.409
Did I do good, Josh?

14:09.240 --> 14:10.881
You did great, buddy.

14:12.835 --> 14:14.304
Well, look at that.

14:15.232 --> 14:16.968
Randall risked his life for me.

14:17.340 --> 14:18.943
You guys thought he was a spy.

14:19.232 --> 14:20.497
A spy?

14:20.503 --> 14:23.504
Yeah, we heard you on the phone
telling someone that he'd get it soon,

14:23.510 --> 14:25.713
and "He doesn't suspect a thing."

14:25.719 --> 14:27.720
Yeah. My dad doesn't suspect a thing

14:27.726 --> 14:30.714
because my mom and I were planning
a surprise birthday party for him.

14:32.061 --> 14:34.437
Randall, I am so sorry.

14:34.443 --> 14:36.153
Can you guys get some
aspirin, some towels,

14:36.159 --> 14:37.617
and help clean Randall up, please?

14:37.623 --> 14:39.301
- Sure thing.
- Sorry, Randall.

14:40.426 --> 14:42.646
I'm gonna go drop off the
drive at my office myself.

14:42.652 --> 14:45.473
Wait! Aren't you afraid? What if
the scary men are still out there?

14:45.479 --> 14:47.110
Oh, please, Gabi. I can handle myself.

14:47.116 --> 14:48.619
Elliot, they still in Silicon Valley?

14:48.625 --> 14:50.175
- Yeah.
- Gabi, I can handle myself.

14:55.346 --> 14:57.574
Gabi, Rick's coming over
any minute, and I still

14:57.580 --> 14:59.385
don't know what it is
I agreed to do with him.

14:59.391 --> 15:00.731
I'm really freaking out.

15:01.159 --> 15:02.650
What if it's something kinky?

15:03.713 --> 15:05.051
Sofia's in, mate.

15:05.057 --> 15:07.848
She's gonna be our new tambourine girl.

15:08.712 --> 15:10.157
How brilliant is that?

15:11.481 --> 15:12.934
[knocking]

15:13.262 --> 15:14.679
[whimpers]

15:17.203 --> 15:18.492
Hello, hello.

15:18.498 --> 15:20.191
What is that? What is that?

15:21.491 --> 15:23.672
Oh, it's a bottle of bubbly
to get us in the mood.

15:23.678 --> 15:25.875
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

15:26.170 --> 15:27.469
Good. [chuckles]

15:28.078 --> 15:31.790
Okay, ah, so, you
remember how yesterday, um,

15:31.796 --> 15:35.271
- I kind of agreed to do something...
- Yes, yes. And I am so excited.

15:35.277 --> 15:37.739
I've been trying to get a girl
to do this for a while, but...

15:37.745 --> 15:39.066
most are too shy.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.612
- They are?
- So,

15:42.618 --> 15:45.479
do we need to pick one up or do you
have one that you like to play with?

15:48.142 --> 15:49.819
Uh...

15:50.970 --> 15:53.144
I don't know. Uh... What does...

15:53.150 --> 15:55.891
- what does it look like again?
- [laughs]

15:55.897 --> 15:57.333
You're funny.

15:57.339 --> 15:59.282
I know you've seen a few in your day.

15:59.970 --> 16:02.660
But this... but this particular
one you're speaking of,

16:02.666 --> 16:04.631
is it... is it big, is it small?

16:05.907 --> 16:08.391
Well, the one I use is 12
inches, but you're kind of petite,

16:08.397 --> 16:10.619
- so you might want to...
- Okay. Uh...

16:12.186 --> 16:15.666
As long as you can hold it in one hand
and slap it against your bum, right?

16:16.466 --> 16:19.647
Wrong. Wrong. I... I
don't think I can do this.

16:19.653 --> 16:21.319
Sofia, Sofia, don't worry.

16:21.325 --> 16:23.226
We'll go slow until
you get the hang of it.

16:24.607 --> 16:26.669
In no time, you'll be using two at once.

16:28.343 --> 16:29.610
And the guys in the band

16:29.616 --> 16:31.757
- cannot wait to see you in action.
- Okay. Great.

16:32.022 --> 16:33.695
Listen, I am a good girl from Florida,

16:33.701 --> 16:35.461
okay, and whatever sick
thing you've got planned

16:35.466 --> 16:37.570
- is just not gonna happen.
- Sofia, please.

16:37.576 --> 16:40.568
It's natural to be nervous, but...
I'm gonna be right behind you

16:40.574 --> 16:42.092
- the whole time.
- Ew, just go.

16:42.776 --> 16:44.052
Go.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.723
Is there anything I can do for you?

16:48.729 --> 16:52.025
Well, my mom used to make me
chicken noodle soup to feel better.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.759
Okay, I'll make you some.

16:53.765 --> 16:56.499
Yeah, ah, it has to be my mom's
recipe. I e-mailed it to you.

16:57.613 --> 16:59.614
- Super.
- Mm-hmm.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.046
Randall, I have a question.

17:02.052 --> 17:03.668
Do I forgive you?

17:03.674 --> 17:06.821
- It'll be hard, but I...
- After you got mugged,

17:06.828 --> 17:08.376
did you get a makeover?

17:08.382 --> 17:09.758
- [Gabi gasps]
- What?

17:10.127 --> 17:12.915
Oh, my God! You didn't get beat up.

17:12.921 --> 17:14.703
Your black eye has sparkles in it.

17:14.709 --> 17:17.407
Uh... I... I... I... I can explain.

17:17.414 --> 17:19.135
Then talk fast.

17:20.505 --> 17:21.920
Fine, I faked getting mugged.

17:22.347 --> 17:25.372
- Why?
- Why do you think? Money.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.895
This new app is gonna
make someone very rich.

17:27.901 --> 17:29.409
Especially me.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.485
I froze you three out and earned Josh's
trust and he let me take that drive.

17:32.491 --> 17:35.398
And then I cloned it, gave it to
my partners, who are gonna sell it.

17:35.899 --> 17:38.750
Finally, I can afford to move
out of my parents' basement.

17:40.142 --> 17:43.258
The hell you can, bitch! Haha!

17:43.901 --> 17:45.370
I didn't trust you.

17:45.376 --> 17:48.326
So before Josh gave you the
flash drive, I switched it.

17:48.332 --> 17:50.966
The drive I gave you had
my honeymoon photos on it.

17:50.972 --> 17:52.822
I didn't trust him either.

17:52.828 --> 17:54.694
So I switched out the flash drive

17:54.700 --> 17:57.128
for my <i>Best of the Barrys</i> flash drive.

17:58.153 --> 18:00.469
Gibb, White, Manilow.

18:01.068 --> 18:03.681
Oh, my God. We all did the same thing.

18:03.687 --> 18:06.174
You have a <i>Best of the
Barrys</i> flash drive too?

18:06.737 --> 18:08.871
No, No. I did... I didn't
have my own flash drive,

18:08.877 --> 18:10.135
so I went into Josh's office

18:10.141 --> 18:12.605
and I found a new one in the
bottom drawer of his cabinet.

18:12.610 --> 18:16.299
So the one that Randall sold was
just a brand-new, blank flash drive.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.395
Boom! Yeah.

18:18.401 --> 18:21.043
I can't believe I've been busted
by the most unprofessional,

18:21.049 --> 18:24.913
codependent, sexual-harassing,
binge-drinking losers I've ever seen.

18:24.919 --> 18:26.179
I'm out!

18:26.185 --> 18:27.719
Whoa!

18:29.404 --> 18:31.516
You forgot "floor waxin'."

18:32.474 --> 18:34.586
See, if you didn't make me do my job,

18:34.592 --> 18:37.041
the floor would be
sticky like it usually is.

18:37.739 --> 18:39.282
- Ha!
- [door opens]

18:40.414 --> 18:42.856
Um... why is Randall on the floor?

18:42.862 --> 18:45.801
Because he was a spy. His
black eye was fake. See?

18:45.807 --> 18:49.004
And he admitted giving a flash
drive to his partners to sell.

18:49.010 --> 18:51.698
And then he tried to run
and slipped on the floor.

18:51.704 --> 18:53.248
Which I clean on a daily basis.

18:55.276 --> 18:56.987
Well, that is a relief.

18:58.569 --> 19:00.021
God, I'm smart.

19:01.196 --> 19:02.603
What are you talking about?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.189
Well, look, I didn't want
to say anything earlier

19:04.194 --> 19:05.396
'cause I didn't want
to hurt his feelings.

19:05.401 --> 19:07.611
But do you think I'm gonna trust a
guy who's worked for me for one week

19:07.616 --> 19:09.697
with an app I've been
developing for six months?

19:09.703 --> 19:11.506
No way.

19:11.512 --> 19:13.464
I switched the drives.
I gave him a fake one.

19:13.470 --> 19:16.232
The real one I hid for safekeeping
in the bottom drawer of my cabinet.

19:20.112 --> 19:23.075
Your, uh... cabinet drawer
on the left-hand side?

19:24.003 --> 19:26.417
Yeah. Why? Why do you know that?
You didn't touch that drive,

19:26.423 --> 19:28.814
- did you?
- No! Of course not.

19:28.820 --> 19:33.089
Like any of us would go into your
private office and touch your stuff.

19:34.551 --> 19:37.114
Hey, uh... do you know what I'm craving?

19:37.233 --> 19:38.433
Pinkberry.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.325
I hear there's a good
one in Silicon Valley.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.215
Let's go there now.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.800
They posted my dating
article, by the way.

19:51.806 --> 19:54.381
- Congratulations! What's it about?
- Thanks.

19:54.387 --> 19:58.022
Oh... okay, uh, this is a
little embarrassing, but, um...

19:58.028 --> 20:01.500
Do you remember when you were asking
me about playing the tambourine?

20:01.914 --> 20:04.584
Well, I actually thought
you were talking about, um...

20:04.590 --> 20:06.182
- [whispers]
- God, no!

20:07.464 --> 20:10.008
I'm a romantic, I'm not a pervert.

20:10.245 --> 20:12.596
Oh, my God. Me too.
Romantic all the way.

20:13.252 --> 20:14.893
Well, speaking of which,

20:14.899 --> 20:17.363
what do you say we scamper
off to the bedroom with...

20:18.901 --> 20:20.473
with this?

20:20.877 --> 20:22.385
Oh.

20:22.391 --> 20:24.652
You want to make love by candlelight?

20:24.658 --> 20:26.823
No, darling. I want you to light
this and then drip the hot wax

20:26.828 --> 20:28.213
all over my nipples.

20:42.031 --> 20:43.861
Your nipples, right?
