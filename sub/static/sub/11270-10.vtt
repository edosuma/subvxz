WEBVTT

00:05.160 --> 00:09.409
Excuse me. l'm here in response
to the ad in the newspaper

00:09.541 --> 00:12.460
about Mrs Tortelli's children.

00:12.587 --> 00:15.293
What,
is she trying to sell them again?

00:15.800 --> 00:18.637
- What?
- Never mind, never mind. Carla?

00:18.763 --> 00:19.677
Yeah? What is it?

00:19.806 --> 00:22.179
- There's a lady here to see you.
- Oh, yeah?

00:22.310 --> 00:26.179
l'm Miss Gilder. We spoke earlier
about your ad for a tutor.

00:26.316 --> 00:29.982
Oh, yeah. Have a seat
over there and we'll talk.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.858
l'm takin' five.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.450
OK.

00:35.913 --> 00:39.330
Here are my resume
and references, Mrs Tortelli.

00:39.459 --> 00:41.252
You will see l teach all subjects.

00:41.379 --> 00:43.503
l have a great deal of experience,
and,

00:43.632 --> 00:46.634
if l may say so myself,
l'm very highly recommended

00:46.762 --> 00:48.554
by those for whom l've worked.

00:48.681 --> 00:52.977
Forget that. Have you ever been
in any major military skirmishes?

00:54.940 --> 00:55.723
What?

00:55.858 --> 00:58.647
lt's important
l know you can handle yourself.

00:58.779 --> 01:00.856
Just stand up for a minute.

01:03.619 --> 01:05.660
- Give me one.
- Give you one what?

01:05.789 --> 01:08.994
Your best shot, right here.
Coldcock me, honey.

01:09.127 --> 01:11.037
- Don't hold back.
- Waste her.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.296
- Lay one on her.
- Let's go.

01:13.425 --> 01:15.584
You don't really expect me
to strike you ?

01:16.054 --> 01:17.679
Six bucks an hour.

01:21.103 --> 01:22.514
Great shot!

01:24.107 --> 01:27.941
Sit right down here
and we'll work out the details.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.935 --> 02:48.346
Afternoon, everybody.

02:48.479 --> 02:51.101
- Norm!
- Norman...

02:51.692 --> 02:52.973
What's the story, Norm?

02:53.111 --> 02:56.398
A thirsty guy walks into a bar.
You finish it.

02:58.493 --> 03:01.745
Norman, you are looking
especially spry today.

03:01.873 --> 03:04.626
Thank you. ln fact,
l joined a health club today.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.458
Good for you. Nice facilities?

03:07.590 --> 03:09.630
Excellent snack bar.

03:11.011 --> 03:13.420
Norm,
it's gonna add years to your life.

03:13.557 --> 03:16.013
Coach, l felt l had to do something.

03:17.229 --> 03:21.940
Sammy, this guy over here doesn't
believe me about your bar slide.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.478
Would you serve one up
to save my good name?

03:24.614 --> 03:26.524
- My pleasure.
- Thank you, Sammy.

03:26.659 --> 03:29.578
- Let's get this garbage out of here.
- Clear the runway.

03:32.459 --> 03:35.165
- OK, Sammy. Any time you're ready.
- There you go.

03:47.147 --> 03:49.057
Hit the bricks, pal.

03:53.990 --> 03:56.529
OK. How do you do it?

03:57.328 --> 03:59.452
lt's just
one of my two hidden talents.

03:59.581 --> 04:01.456
The other is just as impressive.

04:02.586 --> 04:04.876
But you can hardly
charge a buck for it.

04:09.638 --> 04:11.097
Cheers.

04:11.223 --> 04:12.848
Yeah. Just a sec.

04:12.976 --> 04:15.053
- lt's for you, Sam.
- Give me a second.

04:15.187 --> 04:17.096
l'll put you on hold.

04:27.747 --> 04:30.702
- Thank you, Coach.
- All the classy joints do that.

04:34.006 --> 04:36.629
Hello? Sam Malone.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.427
Hey. Of course l know who you are,
Rick Walker.

04:40.557 --> 04:42.551
Well, it's not too crowded.

04:43.478 --> 04:45.887
lf you're across the street,
come on over.

04:46.023 --> 04:47.483
Yeah.

04:47.609 --> 04:51.655
Hey. You're in luck here.
A genuine Red Sock's on his way over.

04:51.782 --> 04:53.490
No kiddin'?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.574
What are you doing?

04:57.707 --> 05:00.460
Sam, l don't want
a Boston Red Sock to come in here

05:00.586 --> 05:03.791
and get a glass with lipstick on it
or crud at the bottom.

05:04.341 --> 05:06.300
Sit up straight, will ya?

05:08.013 --> 05:11.218
So who is it, huh? Evans?

05:11.352 --> 05:14.270
Rice? Yaz?

05:14.398 --> 05:16.106
You heard of Rick Walker?

05:16.901 --> 05:18.610
He can use that one.

05:19.321 --> 05:20.152
Carla...

05:20.281 --> 05:22.738
For five years,
when he pitched for Detroit,

05:22.868 --> 05:24.612
we couldn't win a game against them.

05:24.746 --> 05:27.238
Then he signed for the Sox
for big bucks

05:27.375 --> 05:30.211
and now he's leading the league
in early showers.

05:30.337 --> 05:32.711
Carla, he's supposed to be a nice guy

05:32.841 --> 05:35.214
and l'm glad
not everybody feels like you do.

05:35.345 --> 05:37.303
- Hi, Sam.
- Hey, Rick!

05:40.769 --> 05:42.347
l'm sorry about that.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.316
That's OK. For me, this is cordial.

05:45.442 --> 05:46.902
- How you doing?
- Good.

05:47.028 --> 05:51.526
Nice to see you.
Let's sit and have a little privacy.

05:53.037 --> 05:58.080
Sam, l know it's crazy for a stranger
to come here for advice

05:58.211 --> 06:02.044
but the pitching coach said
you're the only man who can help me.

06:02.175 --> 06:03.586
Well, l'm flattered.

06:03.719 --> 06:06.507
He said if anyone knows
about slumps, it's you.

06:07.307 --> 06:11.354
- The legend lives on, huh?
- Sam, can l buy you a beer?

06:11.480 --> 06:13.889
No, thanks.
l don't drink anymore.

06:14.025 --> 06:17.277
Yeah. l heard rumours
you used to hit the bottle sometimes.

06:17.405 --> 06:19.114
Well, they're true.

06:19.241 --> 06:20.819
Did you drink during a game?

06:20.952 --> 06:24.453
Never on the mound.
Sets a bad example for the catchers.

06:26.752 --> 06:29.458
- Did drinking help?
- No. Quite the contrary.

06:31.801 --> 06:33.426
How about an early shower?

06:36.766 --> 06:39.437
- Carla, come on.
- The guy's a rag arm.

06:40.939 --> 06:42.019
l'm sorry.

06:42.149 --> 06:45.602
Sam, didn't that guy used to be
a pitching coach for the Red Sox ?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.610
That's Ernie Pantusso.
He works here now.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.949
Good idea. Let's ask him some stuff.

06:51.079 --> 06:53.119
Coach, l want you
to meet Rick Walker.

06:53.249 --> 06:55.622
Hey, Rick. How are ya?
Nice to meet you.

06:55.752 --> 06:57.580
- l'll get you a beer.
- Great.

06:57.713 --> 07:00.040
Sorry things are not
going good for you.

07:00.175 --> 07:03.261
Coach, l just don't know
what l'm doing wrong.

07:04.682 --> 07:07.055
Sam? Who is that man?

07:08.270 --> 07:11.272
That's Rick Walker,
relief pitcher for the Red Sox.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.773
Poor guy's in a slump.
Going through hell.

07:13.903 --> 07:16.360
Try to get out of those things,
the worse it gets.

07:16.490 --> 07:19.362
Well, you know what he needs.
Meditation.

07:21.039 --> 07:25.121
- lt gives you total serenity.
- Well, maybe l could suggest it.

07:25.253 --> 07:28.920
Well, it worked for me.
l used to have this facial tic.

07:29.050 --> 07:31.258
Started meditating, right away.

07:32.388 --> 07:33.800
Really?

07:34.558 --> 07:36.350
- Absolutely.
- What kind of tic ?

07:36.478 --> 07:38.186
Well, it was hardly noticeable.

07:38.314 --> 07:41.102
- Come on. Let me see.
- No. l got rid of it.

07:41.234 --> 07:43.144
lt's a thing of the past.

07:45.449 --> 07:48.902
So, anyway, suggest meditation.
lt just might do wonders.

07:49.037 --> 07:52.657
- l can see it did wonders for you.
- l'm a living endorsement.

07:52.793 --> 07:54.418
Gotcha.

07:55.046 --> 07:57.086
Sam, what am l gonna do ?

07:57.216 --> 08:00.088
Well, have you ever
thought about meditation ?

08:00.220 --> 08:02.261
- l tried everything, Sam.
- Really ?

08:02.390 --> 08:08.146
Sam, forget that meditation. What he
needs to do is beef up his sex life.

08:08.273 --> 08:10.600
See the ladies, take the edge off.

08:10.735 --> 08:14.070
He's right. Sammy's taken
more edges off than a carpenter.

08:16.869 --> 08:20.370
Listen, Rick. ln my day, there was
always attractive young dames

08:20.499 --> 08:22.789
outside the stadium
waiting for players.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.494
- They're still there, Coach.
- Are you kiddin'?

08:25.632 --> 08:29.133
Say hello to Rosie McGonagal for me,
will ya?

08:29.262 --> 08:32.383
- Different ones are there, Coach.
- Yeah.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.477
Listen. Now, he's been in baseball
for a long time.

08:40.611 --> 08:43.104
Maybe there's something
to this sex stuff.

08:43.241 --> 08:47.489
No, Sam, l appreciate the suggestion
but l don't think that's the answer.

08:47.622 --> 08:51.918
Wait just a minute. Don't say it's
not the answer until you've tried it.

08:52.045 --> 08:54.252
- Diane, Diane -
- Excuse me.

08:54.382 --> 08:57.586
My name is Diane.
l have done this for years,

08:57.720 --> 09:02.847
and... l'll tell you, l would be
happy to teach you how to do it.

09:04.688 --> 09:07.524
Diane, this is very kind of you
but l don't think...

09:07.651 --> 09:11.781
No, no, no. Please. Do me
the favour of trying it with me.

09:12.825 --> 09:16.361
- ls she serious?
- Oh, yes. She's serious.

09:16.497 --> 09:18.490
Does it all the time. She just said.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.036
That's right.

09:20.169 --> 09:21.580
Er... Do you...

09:21.713 --> 09:25.083
Oh, are you kidding? Him?
He'd just make jokes.

09:28.890 --> 09:32.723
Well, OK, then. OK.
What time's good for you?

09:32.854 --> 09:34.265
Well, personally,

09:34.398 --> 09:37.435
l like to get at least half an hour
in before breakfast,

09:37.569 --> 09:38.980
but...

09:40.114 --> 09:42.108
Look. Any time's alright with me.

09:42.242 --> 09:44.948
Darling, l like you.

09:46.957 --> 09:52.963
There is something so beautiful
about experiencing it outdoors.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.836
Don't people stare at you?

09:58.641 --> 10:00.800
Yes. Sometimes.

10:00.936 --> 10:03.309
But they end up learning something.

10:04.065 --> 10:06.688
Sometimes people even join in.

10:07.988 --> 10:11.939
All this talk has gotten me excited.
What the hell? Let's do it now!

10:13.162 --> 10:14.573
Outside?

10:14.706 --> 10:17.708
No. lt's a little cold
and l prefer to take my shoes off.

10:17.835 --> 10:20.873
Sam, could we use your office, huh?

10:21.006 --> 10:22.881
Wait. l've let this go...

10:23.009 --> 10:26.380
No, no, no. We don't need
to hear from Mr Sceptic.

10:26.514 --> 10:30.217
Rick here is after something
and l can show him where it is.

10:57.684 --> 10:59.263
Start doing different things.

10:59.395 --> 11:02.267
You gotta... l dunno.
Maybe discover some rituals

11:02.400 --> 11:04.939
or... superstitions.

11:05.070 --> 11:06.731
Maybe carry a lucky charm.

11:06.864 --> 11:08.443
l know that sounds silly,

11:08.575 --> 11:11.827
but what you gotta do now
is break up your routine.

11:11.955 --> 11:14.245
Do you have any superstitions, Sammy?

11:14.834 --> 11:16.958
Well, yeah,
l had one crazy little one.

11:17.087 --> 11:21.217
l never pitched to anybody
named Reggie, Willie or The Bull.

11:22.804 --> 11:24.963
You did have the lucky charm, Sammy.

11:25.683 --> 11:27.842
Yeah, l did. That's true.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.437
What was it?

11:29.564 --> 11:32.732
Well, it was a bottle cap
that l found once.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.195
For some reason, l picked it up
and started carrying it around.

11:36.323 --> 11:37.866
After a while, l figured

11:37.993 --> 11:41.161
it had something to do
with things going my way.

11:41.289 --> 11:43.033
l sure could use that bottle cap.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.125
lt doesn't have to be this one.

11:45.253 --> 11:48.255
lt could be any bottle cap really
or anything.

11:48.383 --> 11:49.842
Sam, you still have it?

11:50.970 --> 11:55.634
Well, yeah. l just started carrying
it around more as a superstition.

11:55.768 --> 11:59.055
- Could l borrow that for a few days?
- This?

11:59.190 --> 12:02.940
Please, Sam.
This could mean my whole career.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.863
Well...

12:04.990 --> 12:07.398
A couple of days. Sure. l guess so.

12:07.535 --> 12:10.906
l can't guarantee
that it's gonna work.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.493
Hey, Sam, l'm desperate.
l'll try anything.

12:14.629 --> 12:16.622
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.

12:16.757 --> 12:19.629
- Let me buy you a beer.
- No, thanks. l got practice.

12:19.761 --> 12:22.597
l'll see you in a couple
of days. Thanks a lot.

12:22.724 --> 12:24.967
- See ya, bud.
- Best of luck. So long.

12:25.102 --> 12:26.597
Hey, Rick?

12:32.404 --> 12:35.323
Hey, Sammy? How about
another beer down here?

12:35.450 --> 12:36.945
Sure.

12:37.078 --> 12:39.748
l never thought
you'd part with the bottle top.

12:39.873 --> 12:44.502
Come on, Coach. lt's er... only
going to be for a couple of days.

12:44.630 --> 12:47.798
lt's not like it's special
or anything magical.

12:47.927 --> 12:50.335
Hey, Cliffy. Here you go.

12:57.023 --> 13:00.857
Gee, l hope you haven't lost
your other talent too.

13:08.415 --> 13:10.704
Did Rick Walker
pitch again last night?

13:10.835 --> 13:12.912
Yeah. He got another save.

13:13.046 --> 13:15.799
That old bottle cap
comes through again, huh?

13:15.925 --> 13:19.972
That's 3 saves and 2 wins in 2 weeks.

13:20.098 --> 13:23.053
All of a sudden, the city of Boston's
in love with him.

13:23.186 --> 13:26.188
- Yeah. Everybody but Sammy.
- Yeah.

13:26.315 --> 13:29.816
Sam and his pre-scientific notions
of magical bottle caps.

13:29.946 --> 13:32.023
You gotta admit. He's had bad luck.

13:32.157 --> 13:34.483
- l know.
- Sorry l'm late.

13:34.619 --> 13:36.030
What is it today, Sammy?

13:36.163 --> 13:39.165
Nothing too exciting.
l locked my keys in the car.

13:39.292 --> 13:40.704
Hey! l won the pool!

13:40.836 --> 13:43.210
Cliff wins three days in a row.
lt's uncanny.

13:43.340 --> 13:45.001
What did you have yesterday?

13:45.134 --> 13:48.421
Scrapes and nicks,
and he cut himself shaving.

13:48.556 --> 13:51.558
And the day before that,
l had... stubbing something.

13:51.685 --> 13:53.311
lt still hurts.

13:54.773 --> 13:56.814
Tell me. What do you like tomorrow?

13:59.405 --> 14:00.734
l see a mine shaft.

14:04.078 --> 14:05.538
Sam, come on.

14:05.664 --> 14:09.877
Tell me you don't think this is
because you've lost your talisman.

14:10.003 --> 14:14.714
Look what's happening to Rick with
that cap, becoming a Hall of Famer.

14:14.927 --> 14:18.380
- He was on AM Boston this morning.
- No kidding. What did he say?

14:18.516 --> 14:24.224
l don't know, l left my TV by
the heater last night. lt exploded.

14:24.357 --> 14:26.980
- Were you hurt?
- No. Luckily l was unconscious

14:27.111 --> 14:28.654
in my bathtub.

14:30.742 --> 14:35.489
Sam? Do you realise that you are
causing these accidents yourself?

14:35.624 --> 14:37.451
What are you talking about ?

14:37.585 --> 14:40.872
Well, you've obviously
got something else on your mind.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.751
You're not concentrating,

14:42.884 --> 14:45.423
You're making these
terrible things happen.

14:47.599 --> 14:50.270
Sammy, let me have
a Dewar's rot and a red wine.

14:50.395 --> 14:53.101
Coach. Listen.

14:55.444 --> 14:58.945
How many games did he win
with that silly thing in his pocket

14:59.074 --> 15:00.818
that he takes it so seriously?

15:01.536 --> 15:02.782
None.

15:03.372 --> 15:05.531
- None?
- None.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.242
Then why does he think
it's a good luck charm?

15:08.379 --> 15:10.456
lt had nothing to do with baseball.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.718
l knew it.

15:13.845 --> 15:15.554
l knew there was more to this.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.426
Come on. Why's it so important?

15:17.559 --> 15:20.680
Please, Diane. l can't tell you.
l'm sorry. l can't.

15:20.814 --> 15:23.021
Come on, Coach. l'm real curious.

15:23.151 --> 15:27.102
OK. You can ask me
a yes or a no question.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.699
OK.

15:29.869 --> 15:31.992
- One question?
- Yes.

15:32.122 --> 15:34.162
Sam, would you take that, please?

15:35.585 --> 15:38.587
Sammy, you grabbed
the coffee pot by the sides.

15:38.715 --> 15:40.375
- Yes l did.
- Doesn't it hurt?

15:40.509 --> 15:42.586
Hurt's not the right word.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.133
Anybody have any money down
on the coffee pot?

15:48.771 --> 15:51.690
Sammy, you've got to
get that bottle cap back.

15:51.817 --> 15:55.104
For the first time in my life,
l'd rather be me than you.

15:56.365 --> 16:00.032
Yeah, Sam, ask the kid for the cap,
will ya? He's goin' good now.

16:00.162 --> 16:03.580
Maybe he's rolling again.
He's got the old confidence back.

16:03.709 --> 16:05.370
Maybe he doesn't need it now.

16:05.503 --> 16:08.375
Sam, please, give him a call.
He'll understand.

16:08.508 --> 16:10.051
- Go on.
- Think so?

16:10.177 --> 16:12.004
Absolutely. Go on. Right now.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.141
Well, alright. lf you guys insist.

16:16.269 --> 16:17.847
Wait a minute, Sammy.

16:17.980 --> 16:21.849
You can't call him now.
His game's started at Fenway.

16:21.985 --> 16:24.062
<i>And the Red Sox take the field...</i>

16:24.197 --> 16:26.867
Well, l guess you're right.

16:27.911 --> 16:29.951
l can survive nine innings, huh?

16:30.080 --> 16:32.454
With your luck,
it'll go into extra innings.

16:34.503 --> 16:37.126
<i>That's out</i>, <i>number 3.</i>
<i>Walker has done it again.</i>

16:37.257 --> 16:42.218
<i>He retires the side and we head into</i>
<i>the bottom of the 2 1 st inning.</i>

16:42.473 --> 16:43.885
Perfect...

16:44.017 --> 16:47.269
No kidding.
Norm, is it the 21 st inning?

16:47.397 --> 16:48.179
Let's see...

16:50.109 --> 16:54.239
l get 22, but this one
could be the national anthem.

16:57.912 --> 17:00.749
That's too much baseball for me.
l'm heading out.

17:00.875 --> 17:05.586
Not me, Cliffy. l'm a real Red Sox
fan. l stay to the very last out.

17:05.714 --> 17:08.124
lt's closing time.
l can't serve you anymore.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.678
Not like it's the World Series
or anything.

17:13.602 --> 17:15.429
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Norm.

17:15.563 --> 17:18.233
Wake up, Diane.
Cliffy, let's go do something.

17:18.358 --> 17:22.523
Not tonight, Norm. l gotta be at the
post office soon to pick up my bag.

17:22.656 --> 17:25.444
l gotta go crawl into bed with mine.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.578
Well. l think l might
get on home too.

17:30.710 --> 17:33.083
l'll see ya tomorrow, Sam.

17:33.213 --> 17:35.207
Come on, Carla. l'll give you a lift.

17:35.341 --> 17:37.251
Nah, l don't wanna miss the game.

17:37.386 --> 17:39.178
You can hear it on the car radio.

17:39.305 --> 17:41.097
How far away is your car ?

17:41.225 --> 17:44.013
- A block and a half.
- Wait for the right moment.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.768
<i>We pause 1 0 seconds</i>
<i>for station identification.</i>

17:46.900 --> 17:48.359
Coach, the keys!

17:48.485 --> 17:49.897
Which direction?

17:50.029 --> 17:53.364
One block north
and about a half a block east.

17:53.492 --> 17:55.533
Or did l take the bus today?

17:58.541 --> 18:02.707
Goodnight, Diane. Sam, don't worry
about a thing. lt's gonna be alright.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.757
Well, l guess l'll knock off too, OK?

18:06.887 --> 18:08.298
Yeah.

18:10.267 --> 18:15.856
Yeah. l could go to the all-night
bookstore in Cambridge

18:15.983 --> 18:19.817
or l could go home
and make myself a cup of tea.

18:21.074 --> 18:23.364
- What do you think l should do, Sam?
- Score!

18:23.494 --> 18:25.820
That would have to be the bookstore.

18:25.956 --> 18:28.744
<i>lt's a high drive. lf it stays</i>
<i>fair</i>, <i>that's a home run.</i>

18:28.877 --> 18:31.036
<i>lt's fair and it's gone!</i>

18:31.172 --> 18:35.752
Right. The game's over
and my baby's comin' home.

18:36.930 --> 18:38.129
May l ask a question?

18:38.265 --> 18:42.016
Could you hold that? l've got
a very important phone call to make.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.107
- You're calling Rick, right?
- Yeah, l think that's his name.

18:46.235 --> 18:48.193
Do you have
the number of the bull pit?

18:48.321 --> 18:52.736
No. They'd probably
be in the bunkhouse by now.

18:53.704 --> 18:56.790
Marty. Hey. Yeah,
lt's, well, it's Mayday Malone.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.329
How are you doing?

18:58.461 --> 19:00.086
Yeah, thank you. l'm fine.

19:00.214 --> 19:02.172
Listen, is Walker there?

19:02.300 --> 19:05.219
Alright.
When he gets out of the showers,

19:05.346 --> 19:07.755
tell him to call me here at Cheers.

19:07.891 --> 19:09.719
Alright? OK. Thanks.

19:12.565 --> 19:14.973
l believe you had a question there.

19:15.110 --> 19:18.362
Well, l guess lt isn't important now.

19:18.490 --> 19:22.536
lt's just that l know this bottle cap
has nothing to do with baseball

19:22.663 --> 19:27.243
and... l was sort of hoping that
you'd tell me what it's about.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.837
l know you've been curious.

19:30.966 --> 19:35.215
l didn't wanna tell you the real
situation cos you'll think l'm silly.

19:36.182 --> 19:38.508
Well, would it ease your mind at all

19:38.644 --> 19:41.219
if l told you
l already think you're silly?

19:41.356 --> 19:43.397
Yeah. That might help a little bit.

19:44.528 --> 19:49.108
You see, that little bottle cap
keeps me from drinking. Silly, huh?

19:53.624 --> 19:57.244
You don't...
hear it speaking, do you?

19:58.381 --> 20:02.131
Well, nothing beyond
an occasional little small talk.

20:02.261 --> 20:04.302
lt is a very little bottle cap.

20:06.225 --> 20:08.800
Alright. l'll buy it.

20:09.522 --> 20:13.272
How does it keep you from drinking,
just out of curiosity?

20:14.529 --> 20:18.481
lt's the cap off the last bottle
of beer l ever drank,

20:18.618 --> 20:21.621
the last anything l ever drank.

20:23.041 --> 20:26.661
l remember holding onto that bottle
cap during some pretty rough nights.

20:26.797 --> 20:30.167
l'd wake up in the morning
and have its imprint in my palm.

20:30.302 --> 20:33.221
lt was flat cos l was
squeezing it so hard.

20:34.516 --> 20:39.394
When l was tempted to have a drink,
sometimes l'd look at the bottle cap

20:39.524 --> 20:42.063
and it would stop me.

20:44.155 --> 20:47.074
That's a pretty great
little bottle cap, huh?

20:47.201 --> 20:50.406
You wanna know something
really crazy?

20:50.539 --> 20:55.287
The last couple of nights, l've
really had an urge to have a drink.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.504
- lt's probably for you.
- Probably.

21:00.637 --> 21:03.723
Listen. Thank you.
Thank you for listening.

21:03.850 --> 21:05.310
Oh, well...

21:05.436 --> 21:09.649
lf l wasn't here, l'd be at home in
bed with <i>The Brothers Karamazov.</i>

21:09.775 --> 21:11.686
Don't say anything.

21:12.613 --> 21:15.699
Hello? Hey, Rick. How ya doing?

21:15.826 --> 21:19.327
Hey, that's a pretty terrific win
you got there for yourself.

21:19.456 --> 21:21.248
Yeah. Congratulations.

21:21.376 --> 21:25.838
Listen. l guess you're kinda back
on the beam now, wouldn't you say?

21:25.965 --> 21:28.208
You know,
l was thinking this afternoon.

21:28.344 --> 21:33.720
You remember l loaned you
a bottle cap or something?

21:33.852 --> 21:36.059
Well, it's gonna sound funny

21:36.189 --> 21:39.524
but l'm kinda missing
that dumb thing.

21:41.989 --> 21:43.400
You did?

21:46.161 --> 21:48.700
Why didn't you tell me that, Rick?

21:52.838 --> 21:54.249
No, that's all right.

21:55.592 --> 21:57.252
No, never mind. That's...

22:00.223 --> 22:01.802
What's wrong?

22:04.271 --> 22:07.641
He lost it a week ago in Kansas City.

22:08.819 --> 22:11.441
He was putting off
telling me about it.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.571
Kansas City.

22:16.580 --> 22:19.417
One town
l've always wanted to see. Huh?

22:19.543 --> 22:21.833
We'll jump on a plane.

22:24.258 --> 22:29.171
Well, what's the difference?
Easy come, easy go, huh?

22:31.226 --> 22:33.303
Come on, Sam. Let's get out.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.317
Go home. Diane...

22:38.445 --> 22:41.862
l tell you what. Even better.
Let's just talk, you know?

22:42.993 --> 22:46.993
What are you gonna tell me that
l haven't heard a hundred times, huh?

22:47.792 --> 22:51.922
Oh, come on, Sam. lt's important
that you not be here tonight, huh?

22:53.300 --> 22:54.711
You don't wanna be in a bar.

22:54.844 --> 22:58.510
Where am l gonna be tomorrow night,
and the next, and the day after?

22:58.641 --> 23:00.052
l'm gonna be in a bar.

23:00.185 --> 23:02.262
You're gonna feel better tomorrow.

23:03.606 --> 23:06.977
No.
No, l'm gonna feel better tonight.

23:07.111 --> 23:10.529
Here's an idea.
Why don't you watch me get drunk?

23:10.658 --> 23:12.402
l'll get real sick...

23:14.163 --> 23:17.368
- Sam, no...
- Don't. Just don't.

24:04.361 --> 24:08.063
l guess l gave
the wrong one to Rick, huh?

24:09.243 --> 24:11.117
l'm sorry. Are you alright ?

24:12.330 --> 24:16.246
Yeah, l'm fine. l knew you could
do it. l knew you could do it.

24:16.378 --> 24:18.122
You're...
