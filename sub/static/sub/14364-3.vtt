Previously on Transformers Prime

00:04.901 --> 00:08.036
It is best that you three
remain under our watch.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.027
Gaze upon Dark Energon!

00:12.062 --> 00:16.535
Legend tells that it holds the
power to... revive the dead.

00:16.857 --> 00:19.133
Cliffjumper's signal
popped back online.

00:21.202 --> 00:23.557
Let's find Cliffjumper!

00:25.437 --> 00:26.937
Cliff!

00:29.171 --> 00:31.364
What is this??
Don't know.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.977
Cliff was covered in it.

00:33.012 --> 00:36.925
Wait! Lord Megatron!
You do not know what it will do!

00:42.811 --> 00:44.327
Tighten your grip, Jack.

00:48.487 --> 00:50.170
H-Hey! What's with you, Arcee?

00:51.110 --> 00:54.156
I thought you might actually enjoy
the ride if we weren't getting shy at it.

00:54.961 --> 00:56.461
Oh, bring it!

01:01.785 --> 01:04.554
Ready, set...
Miko...

01:04.589 --> 01:06.797
I'm supposed to be protecting you.

01:06.832 --> 01:10.739
Bulkhead, I'm strapped tight
inside ten tons of metal muscle.

01:10.989 --> 01:12.528
I'm protected.

01:37.076 --> 01:38.396
No fair, Bumblebee!

01:38.397 --> 01:41.056
You've been driving a lot
longer than I have!

01:48.110 --> 01:50.567
Thank goodness for
peace and quiet!

01:51.408 --> 01:53.621
House guests can be
such a bother!

01:55.485 --> 01:56.985
Wha...?

02:04.504 --> 02:06.004
Optimus?

02:07.708 --> 02:09.208
By the Allspark!

02:11.635 --> 02:18.448
Subtitles,sync by Iwanita. Corrections
and 1080p BluRay sync Wally73

02:35.664 --> 02:37.351
I needed that!

02:48.569 --> 02:50.952
And stay broken!

02:51.843 --> 02:54.282
Now, what could have caused that?!

02:54.952 --> 02:57.586
I have a grave suspicion, Ratchet...

02:58.094 --> 03:00.026
Dark Energon.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.649
Lord Megatron?

03:14.475 --> 03:17.888
It's as if the blood of
Unicron the Destroyer

03:18.451 --> 03:20.820
flows through my veins!

03:21.038 --> 03:24.253
As if I hear his very thoughts.

03:24.896 --> 03:27.371
I now know what I must do.

03:28.720 --> 03:33.036
And what can I do
to assist you, Master?

03:33.071 --> 03:34.717
Quit groveling.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.461
And wait my command.

03:47.904 --> 03:49.404
Soundwave!

03:49.632 --> 03:52.577
I fear that now our master
reach for the stars

03:52.739 --> 03:56.301
he came down with a
touch of space madness

03:57.030 --> 04:01.769
Lord Megatron has not sound
on his judgment since his return.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.556
Increase global surveillance!

04:05.515 --> 04:09.417
<i>Quit groveling.</i>
<i>And await my command.</i>

04:09.452 --> 04:11.184
I'm not deaf!

04:11.382 --> 04:13.935
But if Optimus Prime lives...

04:14.820 --> 04:18.122
I believe it is in
Lord Megatron's best interest

04:18.156 --> 04:22.778
that we ensure
his enemies destruction.

04:23.411 --> 04:26.157
If the residue Arcee found
on Cliffjumper

04:26.192 --> 04:28.605
brought your broken
equipment to life,

04:28.640 --> 04:32.737
it would stand to reason
that the very same substance

04:32.772 --> 04:36.069
brought Cliffjumper
back from the dead.

04:37.279 --> 04:41.338
That would account for his life signal
inexplicably coming back online,

04:41.373 --> 04:43.180
but... Dark Energon?

04:43.523 --> 04:46.652
It's so scarce seems to
be virtually non-existent.

04:47.178 --> 04:49.638
What would it be doing on Earth?

04:49.673 --> 04:53.597
It was transported. By Megatron.

04:53.632 --> 04:57.712
For what purpose?
To conquer this planet,

04:57.747 --> 05:01.224
by raising an army
of the undead.

05:03.654 --> 05:07.696
Well, Megatron would need to break
quite a few toaster ovens.

05:07.697 --> 05:13.351
I mean, where on this world would he
find that many cybertronian dead?

05:19.352 --> 05:22.045
That was awesome!
Can we do it again?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.580
Sweet!

05:26.246 --> 05:29.005
Sorry! Must have left
that in the back seat...

05:29.314 --> 05:31.730
Autobots, prepare to...

05:34.417 --> 05:37.153
Roll out?
Remain here.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.175
Ratchet, you'll come with me.

05:39.210 --> 05:43.118
Arcee, we'll be outside
communications range for some time

05:43.153 --> 05:45.160
so I'm putting you in charge.

05:45.195 --> 05:48.309
Dude, You're biggest.
You should be the boss!

05:49.010 --> 05:52.076
Err, he never picks me.
Optimus...

05:52.111 --> 05:54.833
With all due respect.
Plain bodyguard is one thing;

05:54.834 --> 05:56.258
babysitting's another.

05:56.259 --> 05:59.036
Besides, Ratchet hasn't been
in the fields since the war.

05:59.071 --> 06:00.597
My pistons may be rusting,

06:00.632 --> 06:02.663
but my hearing is sharp as ever!

06:02.698 --> 06:06.484
For the moment it's
only reconnaissance.

06:06.519 --> 06:08.668
And why do I hear an
edge in your voice?

06:09.087 --> 06:12.294
Arcee, much has changed
in the last 24 hours,

06:12.801 --> 06:15.240
and we all need to adapt.

06:16.012 --> 06:18.414
Ratchet! Bridge us out!

06:28.298 --> 06:31.819
OK, chief... so, what's on
the activities list?

06:32.413 --> 06:33.925
I'm going on patrol.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.001
But Optimus told us to stay.

06:36.036 --> 06:38.291
When you are in charge you
can call the shots.

06:38.326 --> 06:39.894
'Bee! With me!

06:42.156 --> 06:43.888
Bulkhead, you're in charge.

06:47.416 --> 06:50.597
So... uh... what's on
the activities list?

06:53.493 --> 06:55.914
How about band practice?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.728
But we are not a band...

06:57.763 --> 07:00.753
Why so antisocial?
Come on, Raf, do you play anything?

07:02.798 --> 07:03.969
Hmm... keyboard?

07:03.970 --> 07:06.570
Laptops and samples, good!
Jack?

07:06.605 --> 07:09.863
I, sometimes mess around
on the harmonica.

07:10.185 --> 07:12.232
Do I look like I do country?

07:12.507 --> 07:15.844
Just cover yourself in fake blood
and jump around screaming.

07:17.578 --> 07:21.527
Bulkhead! Percussion!
We'll go for a big industrial sound.

07:21.879 --> 07:23.981
DIY, we are a band!

07:24.016 --> 07:26.659
You just need to learn the songs.
This one's a ballad,

07:26.694 --> 07:28.858
'My fist, your face'.

07:41.570 --> 07:44.338
Come on! You can't
handle raw power?

07:44.373 --> 07:46.589
Proximity sensor.
Quick, hide!

07:49.912 --> 07:51.412
Prime!

07:51.959 --> 07:53.459
Agent Fowler.

07:53.709 --> 07:55.910
Uh. He's not here.
Nobody's here.

07:56.414 --> 07:57.914
Except me, of course.

07:58.069 --> 08:00.568
Wh-, where did he go?
Wait, don't tell me,

08:00.603 --> 08:02.772
He's out pankacking
a mini-mall!

08:02.807 --> 08:06.046
Now, I don't know what language
you 'Bots speak on your planet,

08:06.081 --> 08:09.305
but Prime promised he would
handle the Decepticons,

08:09.340 --> 08:11.613
and blowing a crater in
the middle of Nebraska

08:11.648 --> 08:14.786
is not what the word
'handle' means to me!

08:14.821 --> 08:16.358
So, you tell prime...

08:19.858 --> 08:21.935
Since when are you,
'Bots, electric?

08:26.866 --> 08:29.998
Hey! How are you doing?
Contact with civilians!

08:30.535 --> 08:34.010
Team Prime has really
gone off rules this time.

08:34.044 --> 08:35.546
Wait, don't tell me!

08:35.982 --> 08:38.058
You are running a
daycare center?

08:39.529 --> 08:41.852
Hummm...
We are interns.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.030
Student interns.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.154
Earning extra credits in...

08:46.155 --> 08:47.719
Mechanics! Robotics!

08:48.134 --> 08:49.327
OK...

08:49.328 --> 08:50.828
Let's move!

08:50.944 --> 08:53.349
I'm taking all three of you
into federal custody.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.397
For your own protection.

08:56.442 --> 08:58.018
We are protecting them.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.980
Is that so?

09:00.335 --> 09:03.907
Well, maybe you can explain that
to my superiors at the Pentagon!

09:03.942 --> 09:05.785
Don't use that phone! It's...

09:07.068 --> 09:09.686
...Out of order.
This isn't over, Big 'Bot,

09:09.721 --> 09:11.274
not by a long shot!

09:36.355 --> 09:39.840
Optimus, what do we
hope to find here?

09:40.271 --> 09:44.399
The site of the largest cybertronian
battlefield on this galaxy.

09:44.434 --> 09:47.701
On Earth? You must be joking!

09:47.736 --> 09:50.293
Do you recall the period
late in the war,

09:50.538 --> 09:53.289
when both sides began hiding
their energon spoils

09:53.324 --> 09:55.754
off-world?

09:55.789 --> 09:58.622
Of course, that's the reason
energon deposits

09:58.657 --> 10:00.947
exist on planets
such as this one.

10:01.263 --> 10:06.706
It is also the reason battles came to
be waged on planets such as this one.

10:07.272 --> 10:12.083
And I fear Megatron's memory
is as long as history.

10:26.561 --> 10:30.047
Sir! Agent Fowler.
We have a situation.

10:30.306 --> 10:32.345
I'm en route from the Autobot base.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.528
I'll brief you in person.

10:37.199 --> 10:40.266
<i>Agent Fowler, I'm en route</i>
<i>from the Autobot base.</i>

10:40.301 --> 10:41.938
<i>I'll brief you in person.</i>

10:41.973 --> 10:44.180
Autobot base, said!

10:44.594 --> 10:47.825
Humans. Always the weak link.

10:48.162 --> 10:51.048
Fetch me this 'Fowler',

10:51.163 --> 10:53.751
So that he may brief us instead.

11:05.163 --> 11:07.936
Hey! Big bird, I'm flying here!

11:11.186 --> 11:12.824
What in uncle Sam's beard!?

11:22.334 --> 11:25.865
First the freeways aren't safe,
now air travel?!

12:07.586 --> 12:09.181
You wanna dance, 'Con?

12:10.977 --> 12:12.077
I'll lead!

12:34.232 --> 12:37.130
Never an Autobot around when
you actually need one!

13:23.589 --> 13:24.129
My ears!

13:24.596 --> 13:27.808
It's an S.O.S.
From Fowler.

13:34.174 --> 13:34.974
Did you trace it?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.842
Location scan in incomplete.

13:38.182 --> 13:41.795
Oh, well.
Oh, well? Seriously?

13:41.964 --> 13:43.493
Fowler's a jerk!

13:44.251 --> 13:47.543
Whether you like the guy or not
the Decepticons may have it!

13:47.923 --> 13:50.710
And Agent Fowler
knows your location...

13:51.481 --> 13:53.279
Our location!

13:53.280 --> 13:56.922
And did we not just witnessed how
fast Fowler backs down from a 'Bot;

13:56.923 --> 13:58.914
The 'Cons will totally
make him squeal!

13:58.935 --> 14:00.585
But we lost the transmission.

14:00.692 --> 14:02.200
Fowler could be anywhere.

14:02.701 --> 14:05.019
Maybe I can near it down.

14:05.020 --> 14:06.642
About five years ago...

14:06.643 --> 14:08.890
the Government started
microchipping their agents.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.510
You know, like owners
do with pets.

14:13.945 --> 14:16.096
What? I saw it on TV.

14:16.097 --> 14:18.621
Anyway, if I can hack into the
Fed's mainframe...

14:18.622 --> 14:21.682
maybe I can pinpoint
Fowler's coordinates.

14:21.683 --> 14:23.007
You know how to hack?

14:23.008 --> 14:28.352
But you're like... two years old!
Twelve. And a quarter.

14:35.913 --> 14:40.093
Welcome, agent Fowler.

14:42.350 --> 14:44.615
You treat all your
guests this nice?

14:45.877 --> 14:48.676
Any friend of the Autobots.

14:48.677 --> 14:49.855
Autobot?

14:49.856 --> 14:53.899
That one of them coin operated
wash-my-own-car places?

14:54.380 --> 14:56.532
Oh, so that's how it's
going to be, hmm?

14:57.058 --> 15:02.749
Apparently no one has told you
I have no appreciation for human humor.

15:02.751 --> 15:05.471
Make our guest comfortable.

15:11.347 --> 15:16.246
Latitude 39.5,
Longitude 116.9.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.767
OK, wait here.

15:22.639 --> 15:25.041
Ow, don't break up the band!

15:26.902 --> 15:28.769
Jack, you're in charge!

15:32.228 --> 15:34.673
Guess we three have
run out the place.

15:34.756 --> 15:35.957
Miko?

15:37.662 --> 15:39.055
Miko?

15:45.826 --> 15:47.013
Fowler?

15:50.307 --> 15:52.533
The whole Decepticon shipbay.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.516
Alright!

16:05.517 --> 16:07.212
What's the plan?

16:07.213 --> 16:08.634
Miko!

16:14.479 --> 16:16.012
Unwise.

16:22.463 --> 16:23.788
Miko, get down!

16:45.584 --> 16:47.445
Hold him still!

17:01.045 --> 17:02.398
Miko, look away!

17:02.399 --> 17:04.507
But...
Turn your head away!

17:13.933 --> 17:15.977
<i>Arcee, Bumblebee, do you read?</i>

17:15.978 --> 17:17.535
Loud and clear, Bulkhead.

17:17.536 --> 17:21.558
I have a situation.
Bulkhead, they're children...

17:21.559 --> 17:24.336
Humans, just do whatever.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.795
You are where?!
She is where??!!

17:31.920 --> 17:33.127
What should we do?

17:33.236 --> 17:35.518
Bulkhead may have not even
realized she'd followed him.

17:36.042 --> 17:38.729
Miko hasn't seen the 'Cons
in action like we have.

17:39.284 --> 17:41.374
She has no idea.

17:41.375 --> 17:44.811
Those are the coordinates.
Their destination is still locked in.

17:47.135 --> 17:49.349
You're in charge!

17:50.066 --> 17:51.679
In charge of who?

18:08.092 --> 18:10.230
<i>Arcee to base, come in.</i>

18:10.662 --> 18:13.710
<i>Jack? Listen up, we
need you to bridge us back.</i>

18:14.526 --> 18:16.037
<i>Hello?</i>

18:16.748 --> 18:18.931
Bumblebee, metal to the pedal!

18:24.461 --> 18:25.913
Agent Fowler,

18:25.914 --> 18:27.564
I have one single request...

18:27.565 --> 18:31.092
that would save your family
the pain of grieving.

18:31.093 --> 18:35.613
Tell me the location
of the Autobot base.

18:36.430 --> 18:37.489
No problem.

18:37.490 --> 18:39.450
But I need to ask you
something first.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.860
Yes, I'm listening.

18:41.861 --> 18:45.131
I've got an issue with the
customer service around here.

18:45.132 --> 18:46.816
Can I speak to the manager?

18:50.032 --> 18:54.024
I make the decisions here.
I am in charge!

18:55.129 --> 18:57.067
Bring the prod.

18:58.093 --> 19:00.712
What's taking Arcee
and Bumblebee?

19:00.713 --> 19:03.645
Dude, the cons could be putting
the clamps on Fowler right now.

19:03.646 --> 19:05.365
Let's just storm the joint!

19:06.350 --> 19:07.755
They're here!

19:11.603 --> 19:13.818
Why don't those guys hang
with their own 'Bots?

19:13.819 --> 19:16.126
This isn't one-on-one time.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.413
Are your bones vibrating?

19:24.195 --> 19:25.852
You there!

19:25.853 --> 19:27.112
Scrap!

19:28.263 --> 19:31.573
I'll ask nicely one last time.

19:32.234 --> 19:35.858
The Autobot base!
Sure thing buddy...

19:35.859 --> 19:38.976
right after you eat
my star-sequined shorts!

19:43.467 --> 19:44.812
As I imagined.

19:44.813 --> 19:49.634
Energon and human nervous
systems don't mix.

20:02.109 --> 20:04.838
For the first time
in my life, Optimus...

20:04.839 --> 20:07.165
I had hoped that you were wrong.

20:12.326 --> 20:15.260
Optimus!
Been well?

20:15.934 --> 20:19.013
I see you brought your...
trusty watchdog.

20:19.513 --> 20:24.369
I could certainly be condolencing
in a scrap yard by now.

20:24.370 --> 20:28.204
Why don't you invite him
down here for a chat?

20:28.681 --> 20:32.270
I know why you're here, Megatron.

20:32.271 --> 20:35.042
Hardly a surprise, Optimus.

20:35.043 --> 20:39.223
After all, you and I have been
at this a long time.

20:39.387 --> 20:42.662
And your time
has come to an end!

20:58.634 --> 21:01.521
Rise, my army!

21:07.603 --> 21:09.495
By the Allspark!

21:22.082 --> 21:27.840
Behold the power
of Dark Energon!
