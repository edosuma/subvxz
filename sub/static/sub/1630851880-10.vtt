00:08.208 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
TEN MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND ONE MINUTE IN THE PAST

00:49.125 --> 00:50.208
I'm going to

00:51.625 --> 00:53.750
Remind you

00:55.375 --> 00:57.416
What you don't want to be

00:57.500 --> 00:59.416
What you are unintentionally

00:59.500 --> 01:02.333
What you can no longer do

01:04.291 --> 01:05.458
I'm going to

01:06.833 --> 01:08.750
Remind you

01:10.750 --> 01:12.666
What will no longer be

01:12.750 --> 01:14.500
What you will no longer have

01:14.583 --> 01:17.541
What you will never have again

01:19.541 --> 01:26.208
Sleep under the starry and sincere sky

01:26.291 --> 01:29.833
Give you the whole world

01:30.375 --> 01:34.791
Be the only one, the first one

01:44.541 --> 01:45.375
Hello.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.083
Hi.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.000
Thank you.

02:14.625 --> 02:16.125
You haven't been here in ages.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.125
Since last year, right?

02:24.875 --> 02:25.708
Yes.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.583
You must be tired from the trip.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.000
Not really.

02:37.666 --> 02:39.291
I thought you'd bring more stuff.

02:41.041 --> 02:41.875
No.

02:43.958 --> 02:46.541
Well, I'll take these things to your room.

02:47.416 --> 02:48.250
Let me help.

02:59.958 --> 03:01.708
I didn't have time to make the bed,

03:03.666 --> 03:05.541
but I do have clean sheets for you.

03:06.541 --> 03:07.375
Thank you.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.291
Are you hungry?

03:11.666 --> 03:12.500
Yeah.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.000
I don't have any food here.

03:16.958 --> 03:18.375
We're going to the bar, right?

03:30.375 --> 03:33.250
Hey, Vicente,
I see you're in good company today.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.166
I am.

03:34.958 --> 03:36.333
-Hi.
-Hello.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.833
Is this your daughter?
I wouldn't have recognized her.

03:38.916 --> 03:39.750
This is her.

03:40.708 --> 03:42.916
-She's gorgeous.
-Thank you.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Here's your drink.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.458
-What would you like, Lina?
-I'll have the same.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.750
And to eat…

03:51.833 --> 03:55.291
I hope you're not like your dad.
He never tries anything new.

03:55.375 --> 03:57.791
-He always orders a sandwich.
-That's what I like.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.958
Get him to try something different.

04:00.041 --> 04:02.333
I'm not sure I'll succeed.
I'll have one too.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.708
-Another sandwich.
-Another sandwich?

04:05.958 --> 04:08.375
Just as boring as her dad.
Is that even possible?

04:08.875 --> 04:10.791
I'm not, but today I am.

04:21.416 --> 04:22.250
There you go.

04:23.416 --> 04:24.791
Two sandwiches.

04:24.875 --> 04:27.000
-They look great.
-Delicious.

04:31.750 --> 04:32.958
So, how are you, Dad?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.083
The same as always.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.833
Except I don't work now, so,

04:38.333 --> 04:39.583
I've got more time.

04:41.166 --> 04:42.125
Time for what?

04:43.416 --> 04:45.875
Every day, I hop on my bike
and ride to the seawall.

04:45.958 --> 04:47.166
Then I take a dip.

04:47.791 --> 04:48.625
And sometimes,

04:50.500 --> 04:51.625
I think about fishing.

04:52.708 --> 04:53.791
Did you say fishing?

04:54.666 --> 04:56.125
-Do you fish?
-Yes.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.166
But I haven't done it for years now.

04:58.916 --> 05:00.208
About 40 years or so.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.416
I had no idea.

05:03.791 --> 05:05.916
And now I'm busy tidying things up.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.125
Some of your mother's things.

05:13.041 --> 05:13.916
So,

05:15.416 --> 05:16.416
why are you leaving?

05:19.041 --> 05:21.500
It's something
I've wanted to do for ages and

05:22.291 --> 05:23.250
I got the chance now.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.875
Are you guys moving out?

05:28.750 --> 05:30.375
I'm turning the keys in on Monday.

05:36.375 --> 05:37.708
I'm not with Nico anymore.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.208
I suspected as much.

05:44.375 --> 05:45.208
Are you okay?

05:47.875 --> 05:48.708
Yes.

05:53.583 --> 05:54.958
Saying goodbye is not easy.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.500
Like father, like daughter.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.375
You're eating the same sandwich.

06:04.458 --> 06:05.750
You can tell you're family!

06:06.250 --> 06:09.125
-All right, see you around.
-Bye.

06:09.208 --> 06:10.208
See you.

06:19.583 --> 06:20.750
There are some things.

06:22.458 --> 06:23.291
What?

06:24.291 --> 06:26.625
We do have some things in common.

06:30.166 --> 06:31.041
Our noses.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.000
But yours is prettier.

06:35.583 --> 06:36.416
Like Mom's.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.083
We're different in a lot of ways too.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.083
You moved on, and I…

06:48.083 --> 06:49.000
I stayed here.

06:53.666 --> 06:54.916
I didn't have a choice.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.083
I wanted a fresh start, and

07:00.083 --> 07:01.708
I wasn't going to get that here.

07:07.875 --> 07:08.916
Are you happy here?

07:10.333 --> 07:11.166
Well…

07:12.666 --> 07:13.791
Look, when Mom died…

07:16.000 --> 07:18.541
I accepted
that I'd never be that happy again.

07:21.416 --> 07:22.250
I know…

07:24.625 --> 07:26.541
I know it wasn't easy to live with me.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.708
I never accepted losing her.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.291
That was what made you leave.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.208
But now we're here.

07:42.083 --> 07:42.916
We are.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.208
I wanted to say bye to you, Dad.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.208
Nico, I still love you, but…

09:17.250 --> 09:20.041
I don't know…
I don't know if this is it, you know?

09:21.958 --> 09:23.333
I don't want to forget you.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.000
It'll pass.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.125
All of this.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.000
And we'll be fine one day.

10:34.833 --> 10:35.666
Hello.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.208
Hi.

10:40.916 --> 10:42.125
What are you doing here?

10:44.375 --> 10:45.625
I heard you were leaving.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.166
I am.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.208
I wanted to say goodbye.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.291
And also tell you that it didn't work.

11:00.708 --> 11:01.541
What didn't?

11:04.875 --> 11:05.916
What you said.

11:09.708 --> 11:10.791
About forgetting you.

12:50.083 --> 12:53.500
