NARRATOR:
Tonight on<i> Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:04.004 --> 00:07.831
This lost Josephine Mine could
be hiding an untold fortune.

00:07.915 --> 00:10.500
<i>There was 72,000 pounds of gold.</i>

00:10.585 --> 00:12.669
<i>That's $2.37 billion.</i>

00:12.754 --> 00:14.179
- Wow.
- Whew.

00:14.338 --> 00:15.764
MATTY: There's a legend
about a mysterious door.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.017
CARTER: You don't often
get an eyewitness account.

00:18.176 --> 00:20.602
With our flashlights,
we could see the door.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.770
- JEREMIAH: Let's do it.
- MATTY: It's time.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.439
MATTY:
Oh, my goodness.

00:23.598 --> 00:25.015
JEREMIAH: We're about
200 feet below the surface.

00:25.099 --> 00:27.109
- Matty! Gypsy!
- GYPSY: What you got?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.028
- JOE: Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, no way.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.198
All the while
we were growing up,

00:33.283 --> 00:36.285
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.454
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:38.538 --> 00:40.113
cursed treasure.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.124
Civil War gold.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.877
- (laughter) - Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:45.036 --> 00:47.204
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:47.297 --> 00:50.132
- Whoa.
- waiting to be explored.

00:50.291 --> 00:53.126
RICK: So, we like to reach
out to other treasure hunters.

00:53.211 --> 00:55.462
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.556
- MARTY: We want to hear their stories...
- That's right.

00:57.715 --> 01:00.059
- and share our insights.
- "Ill-gotten gains."

01:00.218 --> 01:01.560
- RICK: And who knows...
- GARY: I got it.

01:01.719 --> 01:03.312
maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.971
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.732
Wow. That is gold.

01:06.891 --> 01:08.650
- RICK: But all over the world.
- Yeah!

01:08.735 --> 01:10.319
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:19.403 --> 01:20.987
MATTY: It's funny how these
different mysteries,

01:21.072 --> 01:24.416
you know, sometimes the more
people you get to know on them--

01:24.575 --> 01:26.502
The different treasure hunters--
It's-it's like, a...

01:26.586 --> 01:28.411
- it can be a small circle.
- Mm-hmm.

01:28.496 --> 01:30.172
Treasure networking, Matty.

01:30.331 --> 01:31.832
- Treasure networking.
- Yes.

01:31.916 --> 01:35.001
And it-it's actually
that network

01:35.095 --> 01:38.421
that I want to talk to you guys
today, because Gypsy Jewel...

01:38.515 --> 01:40.507
who's looking for Sambas Gold...

01:40.591 --> 01:43.176
- BOTH: Yeah.
- she actually told me

01:43.261 --> 01:46.688
about a treasure hunter that
she met named, uh, Terry Carter.

01:46.848 --> 01:49.349
- Okay.
- She learned from him

01:49.442 --> 01:51.434
a story that he's involved with,

01:51.528 --> 01:52.936
and I think
you guys will like it,

01:53.029 --> 01:55.188
because it kind of checks
a lot of boxes.

01:55.273 --> 01:56.940
Let's hear.
What's the substance of it?

01:57.024 --> 01:58.784
- Well...
- Is it a pirate treasure or something?

01:58.868 --> 02:00.944
- What are we talking about here?
- I think even bigger than that.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.956
- Really?
- Yeah. Think Spanish gold.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.542
- Okay.
- And think Spanish efforts in America

02:06.701 --> 02:08.710
- mining gold.
- Where?

02:08.795 --> 02:12.631
Utah. The lost Josephine Mine?

02:14.876 --> 02:16.960
NARRATOR:
Following the Spanish conquest

02:17.053 --> 02:19.638
of the Aztec Empire
in central Mexico

02:19.722 --> 02:23.142
and the execution
of their emperor Montezuma,

02:23.301 --> 02:26.061
surviving Aztecs fled north
with a vast treasure

02:26.220 --> 02:29.389
of gold, silver and jewels.

02:29.473 --> 02:32.642
Spanish expeditions
led by conquistadors

02:32.727 --> 02:34.644
including Hernán Cortés

02:34.737 --> 02:36.897
and Francisco Vázquez
de Coronado

02:36.981 --> 02:39.900
searched far and wide
for the missing riches

02:39.984 --> 02:42.828
as well as literal
rumored cities of gold

02:42.987 --> 02:46.165
in the land that would become
the United States.

02:47.658 --> 02:50.335
Although these treasures
were never located,

02:50.494 --> 02:52.662
the Spanish did succeed
in finding numerous

02:52.747 --> 02:55.582
natural deposits
of precious metals,

02:55.675 --> 02:59.678
and forced the indigenous people
to help them mine the riches.

02:59.837 --> 03:02.431
NELSON: The Spaniards
put Native Americans

03:02.590 --> 03:07.603
into, essentially slavery,
a system called the<i> encomienda,</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:10.856
which was a law that enabled
the Spanish to enslave

03:11.015 --> 03:13.683
any non-Christian peoples
who they ended up subjugating

03:13.768 --> 03:15.518
as part of their
colonial expansion.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.197
NARRATOR:
For the next 150 years,

03:18.356 --> 03:21.775
Spanish conquistadors,
aided by Jesuit priests,

03:21.859 --> 03:24.527
established a number
of silver and gold mines

03:24.621 --> 03:27.030
reaching as far east
as Louisiana,

03:27.123 --> 03:29.124
and according
to some researchers,

03:29.209 --> 03:32.044
as far north as Utah.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.130
FOLSOM: Spain starts shipping
back about two million pounds

03:35.289 --> 03:37.624
worth of silver every year.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.793
They set up
these mining operations,

03:39.886 --> 03:42.554
and every Spaniard that can
lay a claim to this land

03:42.713 --> 03:45.131
will start using,
essentially, Indian slaves

03:45.216 --> 03:46.475
to mine this silver.

03:46.634 --> 03:48.218
NARRATOR:
By the 1680s,

03:48.311 --> 03:50.979
the Indigenous peoples
began to rebel.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.556
In New Mexico, the Pueblo Revolt

03:53.650 --> 03:55.725
united a number of tribes
in organized

03:55.818 --> 03:57.894
and brutally violent retaliation

03:57.987 --> 03:59.980
against their
European colonists.

04:00.064 --> 04:04.067
Other uprisings would soon
follow across the territories,

04:04.160 --> 04:06.403
forcing the Spanish to abandon

04:06.487 --> 04:10.407
or conceal many of their
lucrative mining operations,

04:10.491 --> 04:13.835
leaving a number of them
lost to history.

04:13.995 --> 04:15.662
There are stories everywhere...

04:15.746 --> 04:17.756
- Oh, yeah.
- about treasure mines,

04:17.915 --> 04:19.916
Spanish conquistador
connections,

04:20.009 --> 04:22.678
establishing outposts
or missionaries

04:22.837 --> 04:25.264
across the-the great Southwest.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.599
So, this isn't surprising,

04:27.758 --> 04:30.343
but I'd be very interested
to see, you know,

04:30.428 --> 04:33.355
how these gentlemen
came upon this "story."

04:33.439 --> 04:37.609
Because if it is indeed
the "lost Josephine Mine,"

04:37.768 --> 04:40.195
how did it get "un-lost,"
shall we say?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.355
How did they stumble upon it?

04:42.440 --> 04:45.200
It's important
that treasure hunts continue,

04:45.359 --> 04:47.193
because it's all about history.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.955
This lost Josephine Mine,
in treasure hunting circles,

04:50.114 --> 04:53.533
especially in Utah,
is famous and much sought-after.

04:53.617 --> 04:56.786
And it could be hiding
an untold fortune.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.631
Gypsy tells me it's got
a great story

04:59.716 --> 05:02.884
wrapped around it,
involving a-a door,

05:03.044 --> 05:05.462
and it's just incredible.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.723
WESTRICK:
The lost Josephine Mine

05:07.807 --> 05:11.310
is one of the most famous
lost mines in North America.

05:11.469 --> 05:14.730
It's right up there
with-with the Lost Dutchman,

05:14.889 --> 05:16.565
the-the Lost Adams Diggings.

05:16.649 --> 05:20.143
According to legend,
it was a very, very rich mine.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.811
NARRATOR:
Some historians suggest

05:21.896 --> 05:24.064
that the Josephine Mine
produced as much

05:24.148 --> 05:27.242
as a billion dollars
of gold in today's value

05:27.327 --> 05:30.245
before members
of the Indigenous Ute tribe

05:30.404 --> 05:32.655
staged a violent uprising,

05:32.740 --> 05:34.416
killing a number
of their Spanish captors

05:34.575 --> 05:36.251
in the early 1800s,

05:36.336 --> 05:40.505
and leaving a vast fortune
lost to history.

05:40.664 --> 05:43.008
The mine, according
to most sources, is in Utah.

05:43.167 --> 05:45.585
And a place called Hoyt Peak
is probably

05:45.678 --> 05:47.754
the most likely spot,

05:47.847 --> 05:49.923
and it's still, uh,
you know, a big area.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.175
The legend, of course, persists.

05:52.259 --> 05:54.594
We now have generations
of treasure hunters

05:54.687 --> 05:57.773
who have ventured up
into the Uinta Mountains,

05:57.857 --> 06:00.600
searching for the existence
of the lost Josephine Mine

06:00.693 --> 06:03.103
somewhere in Utah.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.614
Terry is on the verge
of something really incredible.

06:05.773 --> 06:07.857
He has a partner
named Gary Holt.

06:07.950 --> 06:10.786
- Mm-hmm.
- And I believe Terry and Gary

06:10.870 --> 06:13.872
feel like they're on top of it,
and that they can find it.

06:14.031 --> 06:15.698
I don't know any of the details
other than Gypsy telling me,

06:15.792 --> 06:16.958
"You have to talk
to these guys."

06:17.043 --> 06:19.044
- Well, let's do that then.
- Right?

06:19.203 --> 06:20.962
-Call them up.
-MARTY: Yeah, absolutely, -Okay.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.714
That sounds quite interesting.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.710
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Hey, guys.

06:27.795 --> 06:29.796
<i>Hey, how you guys doing?</i>

06:29.889 --> 06:30.964
Good. How are you?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.382
We don't know yet.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.393
It depends on w-what
you want to know.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.561
(laughter)

06:36.646 --> 06:41.316
NARRATOR: Gary Holt is an
entrepreneur and treasure hunter

06:41.401 --> 06:44.477
who has lived most of his life
in Summit County, Utah,

06:44.562 --> 06:46.563
near the Uinta Mountains.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.157
After growing up
enamored with the legends

06:49.316 --> 06:52.744
of lost Spanish mines
in the Western United States,

06:52.903 --> 06:54.737
he has just secured
the legal rights

06:54.822 --> 06:57.416
to explore a property
near Hoyt Peak

06:57.575 --> 07:01.670
that he believes to be
the lost Josephine Mine.

07:01.754 --> 07:05.081
I found out about
the lost Josephine Mine

07:05.166 --> 07:07.083
from my brother,
who got a book from someone

07:07.168 --> 07:09.177
that owned claims up there.

07:09.336 --> 07:11.421
I've spent 12 years

07:11.505 --> 07:15.851
doing a lot of empirical
observations, uh, research.

07:16.010 --> 07:18.761
I think there's about
a 99.9% chance

07:18.855 --> 07:22.441
that the Josephine's gold
is still there.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.609
NARRATOR: Unfortunately,
Gary had to fight

07:24.694 --> 07:26.778
the National Parks
Service of Utah

07:26.937 --> 07:29.197
for more than a decade in court
to secure the rights

07:29.282 --> 07:31.357
to his mine claim.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.195
Now, at 85 years old,
he is no longer physically able

07:35.279 --> 07:38.281
to search
for the believed gold himself.

07:38.365 --> 07:40.950
But thankfully,
Terry Carter has the experience

07:41.043 --> 07:43.703
and determination to help
Gary now attempt

07:43.796 --> 07:45.797
to realize his dream.

07:45.956 --> 07:49.876
You know, I've been
treasure hunting since 1981,

07:49.969 --> 07:52.629
not only looking for Spanish
gold, Spanish treasure,

07:52.722 --> 07:55.223
but the out-of-place
archaeology stuff,

07:55.308 --> 07:57.884
the ancient records,
the things like that.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.637
So when I heard the story
of the lost Josephine Mine,

08:00.721 --> 08:02.889
that really intrigued me.

08:02.973 --> 08:05.484
And so, I made it a point
to try and become friends

08:05.568 --> 08:08.561
with Gary Holt
and go after this stuff.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.982
So, you think you've found
this lost Josephine Mine, Terry?

08:13.075 --> 08:15.235
Tell me about that.
What's happening?

08:15.319 --> 08:19.664
<i>What we have is a waybill
that's left for this mine.</i>

08:19.823 --> 08:23.335
<i>This waybill was written
by a-a Captain Garcia--</i>

08:23.494 --> 08:26.004
<i>He was a captain
over this mining division--</i>

08:26.163 --> 08:27.672
And they had to flee
for their lives.

08:27.831 --> 08:28.998
The-the natives was

08:29.083 --> 08:31.417
<i>chasing them out of the country.</i>

08:31.502 --> 08:34.754
NARRATOR: According to
Gary and Terry's research...

08:34.847 --> 08:38.591
in 1814, Jose Joaquin Garcia,

08:38.676 --> 08:41.844
the Spanish military captain
in charge of the Josephine Mine,

08:41.938 --> 08:44.847
found himself
and his 42 soldiers

08:44.941 --> 08:46.608
under attack by the Indigenous
laborers

08:46.767 --> 08:49.102
who had been enslaved there.

08:49.186 --> 08:52.355
Although 34 of his men
perished in the siege,

08:52.439 --> 08:55.200
Garcia reportedly managed
to seal off a chamber

08:55.359 --> 08:58.695
inside the mine
containing a vast cache of gold

08:58.788 --> 09:01.698
before narrowly escaping
with his life.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.543
In the hopes of one day
returning for the riches,

09:04.627 --> 09:07.295
he penned a detailed waybill,
or instructions,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.873
of where the mine was located
in the Uinta Mountains.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.301
However, he would never
have the opportunity

09:13.386 --> 09:16.388
to return for the hidden gold.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.306
CARTER:
So, a friend of mine went

09:18.391 --> 09:21.142
and researched
and found the Garcia family

09:21.227 --> 09:23.728
and talked with them,
got the documents from them.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.639
- So we got the waybill.
- Hmm. Wow.

09:26.724 --> 09:29.568
And the waybill gets you
right there.

09:29.727 --> 09:32.312
It's so many leagues
from the headwaters

09:32.405 --> 09:33.646
of the River Timpanogos,

09:33.731 --> 09:35.407
which is the Provo River,

09:35.491 --> 09:38.901
and so many leagues
from the Santa Anna River,

09:38.986 --> 09:40.486
which is the Weber River,

09:40.571 --> 09:42.998
and that takes you right
to a canyon

09:43.157 --> 09:44.249
that opens up from the east.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.750
You go up there,

09:45.909 --> 09:48.995
which is right
where Gary's mine is.

09:49.079 --> 09:52.424
- Yeah.
- And-and not only does it talk about how to get there,

09:52.583 --> 09:53.833
but it also talks
about what's inside of it.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.343
HOLT:
That's right.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.337
And there was 240 cargoes,

09:57.430 --> 10:00.181
300 pounds per cargo,

10:00.266 --> 10:03.426
which was 72,000 pounds of gold.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.094
- (scoffs)
- And, uh, at today's price,

10:05.179 --> 10:08.765
that's about $2.37 billion.

10:08.849 --> 10:10.016
- Wow.
- Wow.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.109
Whew.

10:16.940 --> 10:18.441
HOLT: Based on what they said
in the waybill

10:18.525 --> 10:19.776
for the Josephine Mine,

10:19.869 --> 10:24.205
the Spanish left
72,000 pounds of gold,

10:24.365 --> 10:26.449
doré bar gold, in a tunnel.

10:26.533 --> 10:29.702
That's about $2.37 billion.

10:29.787 --> 10:32.297
And they described
exactly where it was--

10:32.381 --> 10:34.299
20 feet from a wooden door

10:34.458 --> 10:36.709
that we had to go through
to get to it.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.211
MATTY:
Wow.

10:38.295 --> 10:39.971
Do we have any proof

10:40.056 --> 10:42.048
that, like, say, for example,
that door exists

10:42.141 --> 10:43.558
or anything like that?

10:43.717 --> 10:46.386
So-so I have an older gentleman

10:46.479 --> 10:49.564
that told me that he was
down there in the '70s

10:49.649 --> 10:51.724
and he found not just a door--

10:51.817 --> 10:53.818
An elaborate door.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.563
So what we got here is
an eyewitness to a wooden door.

10:57.648 --> 11:00.325
This is probably the entrance
to where this treasure is.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.078
And so we're hoping...

11:03.237 --> 11:04.404
we're hoping we can find it.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.239
- Wow.
- MARTY: So is it

11:06.323 --> 11:08.083
a pretty complex structure?
Have you been down in there?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.743
Are there lots of passageways
and tunnels and things?

11:10.828 --> 11:12.337
What do you know about it
right now?

11:12.421 --> 11:14.089
CARTER:
I haven't been down there,

11:14.173 --> 11:16.675
but it's a limestone cavern,
this area is.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.843
- Oh.
- And-and there's all kinds of tunnels.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.670
It's riddled with tunnels.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.338
There's some treacherous parts
to this.

11:22.423 --> 11:24.424
Well, and are you interested

11:24.508 --> 11:26.509
in us kind of helping out
a little bit on this?

11:26.593 --> 11:27.844
'Cause this sounds really cool.

11:27.928 --> 11:29.604
Man, I think we'd love that.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.773
You know, I've seen
how you guys operate.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.766
And with some modern technology,

11:33.859 --> 11:35.685
maybe we could find this door.

11:35.769 --> 11:37.687
I-I like the whole premise.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.022
I think this is--
This is cool, fun.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.533
I tell you what though, Matty.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.443
We got so much to do here.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.696
Why don't you take
the first trip and report back?

11:46.789 --> 11:49.290
I always certainly talk
about eyes and boots.

11:49.450 --> 11:50.700
In this scenario,

11:50.793 --> 11:52.034
- he will be our eyes and boots.
- Yes.

11:52.119 --> 11:53.453
And then you come back,

11:53.546 --> 11:55.204
- and then we'd love to go.
- We might go, yeah.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.049
- Yeah.
- Terry and Gary, can I be there

11:58.134 --> 11:59.208
on the day of the descent,

11:59.293 --> 12:01.052
when you actually go
into the caves?

12:01.137 --> 12:03.388
CARTER: Man, we'd love to
have you there, Matty, but I hope

12:03.472 --> 12:04.973
you're not claustrophobic.

12:05.132 --> 12:08.143
Because the guy who found
the door, the older gentleman,

12:08.227 --> 12:11.304
he told me that you've got
to go through one tight,

12:11.397 --> 12:14.724
um, wormhole, he called it,
and it's pretty tight.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.318
So it's gonna be one heck
of an adventure.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.061
Man, I want you there.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.321
Just don't be claustrophobic
on me.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.740
Are you?

12:21.824 --> 12:22.824
- I am. I can do heights.
- (laughs)

12:22.908 --> 12:24.484
I can do snakes.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.244
I can do u-underwater.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.488
Claustrophobia's
a bad one for me.

12:28.572 --> 12:31.166
You know, if I go all the way
there representing these guys,

12:31.325 --> 12:33.242
scouting it out, I-I think--

12:33.335 --> 12:34.586
I'd love to try
and see that door.

12:34.745 --> 12:36.087
Let's get it set up.
Let's do it.

12:36.246 --> 12:38.247
That'll be step one,
and then we'll see what happens.

12:38.332 --> 12:40.249
- Yep. I agree.
- CARTER: I'm excited.

12:40.334 --> 12:41.760
- Thank you, guys.
- Yeah. - MATTY: All right,

12:41.919 --> 12:43.762
guys, I will coordinate
with you the details

12:43.846 --> 12:45.338
of-of my trip.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.340
And, um, I can't wait.

12:47.424 --> 12:48.933
MARTY:
We'll be in touch. Thanks.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.176
- RICK: Thank you.
- CARTER: Thank you.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.187
♪ ♪

12:57.359 --> 12:59.611
MATTY: I think it's time to pop
this baby into four-wheel drive.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.021
GYPSY:
Wow. Already getting steep here.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.783
They weren't kidding when they
said it was a rough terrain.

13:04.942 --> 13:06.359
Uh-huh.

13:06.443 --> 13:09.111
NARRATOR: Three days
after his meeting on Oak Island,

13:09.196 --> 13:12.532
Matty Blake
and treasure hunter Gypsy Jewels

13:12.625 --> 13:16.461
are heading some 50 miles east
of Salt Lake City, Utah,

13:16.545 --> 13:19.705
into the rugged terrain
of the Uinta Mountains

13:19.799 --> 13:22.291
to meet Terry Carter and his
team at the believed location

13:22.376 --> 13:25.220
of the lost Josephine Mine.

13:25.379 --> 13:27.263
MATTY:
There they are.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.728
-Gypsy, how you been?
-Hey, Terry! It's great to see you again.

13:33.887 --> 13:35.230
-It's been a while.
-Man, it's good to see you. It has been.

13:35.389 --> 13:36.973
Matty, it's good
to finally see you.

13:37.057 --> 13:37.974
Good to see you in person,
my friend.

13:38.058 --> 13:39.308
- How are you?
- Matt. All right.

13:39.401 --> 13:40.977
Hey, I want you to meet
some of these people.

13:41.061 --> 13:42.311
- All right.
- NARRATOR: In order to aid the team

13:42.404 --> 13:44.572
in their effort
to safely navigate the mine...

13:44.731 --> 13:46.241
We got Jon, the tech guy.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.576
Rick and Marty Lagina
have arranged

13:48.661 --> 13:50.078
for subsurface imaging expert

13:50.162 --> 13:52.321
Jon Madsen to join

13:52.406 --> 13:54.740
- today's search.
- CARTER: This is Quinn Pack. - Hi.

13:54.825 --> 13:57.410
He's the mine coordinator.
This is Tom Beardall.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.003
- He's the guy that's seen the door.
- Hey, Tom.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.997
- Good to meet you.
- I knew it. I said to Gypsy coming in,

14:01.081 --> 14:03.091
- I go, "That's got to be Tom."
- Yeah.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.418
- How are you, sir?
- NARRATOR: Now retired,

14:05.511 --> 14:08.004
Tom Beardall earned his living
as a professional miner

14:08.088 --> 14:09.848
for more than 30 years,

14:09.932 --> 14:12.934
unearthing gold, silver
and other precious metals

14:13.018 --> 14:14.602
throughout Utah.

14:14.761 --> 14:17.430
In the early 1970s,

14:17.514 --> 14:19.357
he and his brothers,
Timothy and Robert,

14:19.441 --> 14:21.684
worked on a crew
at this very location.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.437
And on one fateful
and suspenseful day,

14:24.530 --> 14:26.030
while navigating

14:26.189 --> 14:28.449
through the mine's
treacherous tunnel system,

14:28.609 --> 14:32.036
they made a stunning discovery.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.789
Talk to me about,
you know, how you got here.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.032
I know a little bit
about the background,

14:36.116 --> 14:37.783
but how did you end up here?

14:37.868 --> 14:39.711
BEARDALL:
Me and my two brothers

14:39.870 --> 14:42.038
went down
through a little wormhole.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.041
And the only reason
we kept going

14:45.134 --> 14:47.385
- is we had a breeze.
- Sure.

14:47.544 --> 14:49.888
We could feel a breeze
going through there.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.716
So we continued on
through the wormhole and...

14:53.809 --> 14:55.810
got into the first room and...

14:55.895 --> 14:59.472
we went down this steep 45 drop,

14:59.565 --> 15:02.475
got into the second room
and we thought it was the end,

15:02.568 --> 15:06.896
but we could see a crack that
dropped into the third room.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.240
And it was pretty steep
going down.

15:09.399 --> 15:12.744
And with our flashlights,
we could see the door.

15:12.903 --> 15:14.153
Ah.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.738
And so we kept going.

15:15.822 --> 15:18.082
We went right down
in front of the door.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.243
And I'd never seen such...

15:21.328 --> 15:23.504
work in the wood.

15:23.664 --> 15:25.998
-It was sealed.
-You mean-- you mean ornate work

15:26.083 --> 15:27.342
or the fact that it was--

15:27.426 --> 15:28.668
- It was sealed?
- It was solid.

15:28.752 --> 15:30.345
There was no leak or cracks

15:30.504 --> 15:32.004
- or nothing in that.
- Ah.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.098
CARTER: I remember you
telling me it looked like though

15:34.183 --> 15:37.352
that the-the calcite had been
dripping down the walls,

15:37.436 --> 15:39.938
- dripping down the doors, and that was kind of hiding it, too.
- Yeah.

15:40.097 --> 15:42.765
Kind of camouflaging
with the calcite over the years

15:42.849 --> 15:44.684
of covering that door up.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.186
Whatever it was, they didn't
want air getting in there.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.105
They wanted it sealed.

15:49.189 --> 15:51.857
So, I-I want to understand this.
The airflow.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.202
You're following the airflow.
Then you find the door.

15:54.361 --> 15:56.871
- Did you think that was the source of the airflow?
- We-we found--

15:56.956 --> 16:00.458
The airflow led us past
the door.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.702
- So it was basically drifting right-right...
- Right in front of it.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.706
- Really?
- And we just kept following that draft.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.374
- CARTER: And-and Tom was a miner at the time.
- Yeah, I was.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.802
- Ah.
- So he knew the dangers of bad gases.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.887
- Yeah, I...
- He knew if he followed the good air,

16:13.046 --> 16:14.305
he would be okay.

16:14.464 --> 16:15.473
Sure.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.559
NARRATOR:
When traveling underground,

16:18.644 --> 16:21.470
experienced miners often use
the direction of fresh air

16:21.563 --> 16:23.648
flowing in from the ground above

16:23.732 --> 16:27.068
to help guide them through
unfamiliar tunnels and caverns.

16:27.227 --> 16:31.489
It is those airflows that help
to dispel dangerous gases,

16:31.648 --> 16:34.409
such as methane
and carbon monoxide,

16:34.493 --> 16:37.069
that naturally accumulate
in mines

16:37.162 --> 16:40.573
and also help to identify
safe pathways for the miners

16:40.666 --> 16:44.002
as they navigate narrow passages
and treacherous terrain.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.997
So you make
this unbelievable find

16:48.090 --> 16:49.999
of this door.
What happens after that?

16:50.092 --> 16:52.835
BEARDALL:
We had flashlights.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.837
And we was in there
the whole day.

16:54.921 --> 16:58.424
But, um, the lights were getting
so dim you couldn't see.

16:58.508 --> 17:00.259
And then the air got stagnant
in there.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.678
We felt like you wasn't
getting enough air or something.

17:02.771 --> 17:06.098
But I think
it was panicking for--

17:06.183 --> 17:08.768
- 'Cause our light was gone.
- Mm.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.195
And so I prayed to God

17:11.354 --> 17:15.191
if I could get out of there,
I'd never come back.

17:15.275 --> 17:17.785
And once we got out alive,
we was happy.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.528
We would go on with life now,

17:19.621 --> 17:21.706
and we'll-we'll stay away
from there.

17:21.865 --> 17:24.700
But that's the reason
I've never been back.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.285
Well, that's
an incredible story.

17:26.369 --> 17:29.371
So, Jon, is there a more modern
approach we can take

17:29.465 --> 17:31.215
to try to follow
in his footsteps?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.885
Yeah, I-I think, uh, thermal
imaging down in that cave,

17:34.044 --> 17:36.128
so we can see where
those airflows are coming from,

17:36.221 --> 17:38.130
so we can see
the different temperatures,

17:38.223 --> 17:40.049
so we can trace
where that air's coming from.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.727
So I think that'd be great
to do in this.

17:42.886 --> 17:45.563
So we could just still follow
that airflow, potentially.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.482
- Yes.
- God willing, find the door,

17:47.566 --> 17:49.642
follow the airflow at least
though and maybe find

17:49.735 --> 17:52.978
- its source.
- Yeah, 'cause if that airflow went past the door,

17:53.063 --> 17:54.814
we should find it.
And the other nice thing, too,

17:54.898 --> 17:58.067
is wood will be
a different temperature

17:58.151 --> 18:01.570
than the surrounding rock. So if
we're using the thermal imaging,

18:01.663 --> 18:03.906
that door should show up
really well.

18:03.990 --> 18:06.167
- Oh, wow. Okay. Great.
- Wow.

18:07.661 --> 18:11.080
NARRATOR: The forward-looking
infrared device, or FLIR,

18:11.173 --> 18:13.249
can detect fluctuations
in temperature

18:13.342 --> 18:16.344
as small as 70 thousandths
of a degree.

18:16.503 --> 18:19.764
Its ability to display these
differences as a visible readout

18:19.923 --> 18:21.432
will allow the team

18:21.591 --> 18:24.602
to follow the invisible airflow
more precisely--

18:24.686 --> 18:27.605
Technology that didn't exist
when Tom and his brothers

18:27.689 --> 18:31.684
conducted their search
more than 40 years ago.

18:33.103 --> 18:35.696
You think that door's still
down there, waiting for us?

18:35.781 --> 18:38.699
I haven't heard of anybody
that's found that door.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.110
Tom says the same thing.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.121
That's what we're here
to find out.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.613
- I don't know what's behind the door.
- Well...

18:44.698 --> 18:46.124
You know? That's another story.

18:46.283 --> 18:48.376
- Yeah.
- But, to me, the way he describes that door,

18:48.535 --> 18:49.877
that's a historical find,

18:49.962 --> 18:51.954
whatever--
Just finding that door,

18:52.038 --> 18:53.297
man, that's a treasure.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.124
That's a mission
that I really can get behind,

18:55.208 --> 18:57.293
is-is wanting
to validate his story.

18:57.377 --> 18:58.878
And I know that Rick and Marty
would love that, too.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.297
Tom, thank you so much.
Your story's incredible,

19:01.390 --> 19:03.474
and, um, I know
that I'm really motivated

19:03.633 --> 19:06.144
and you are to-to prove
your story correct.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.147
I'm gonna bow out and
wish you guys the best of luck.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.639
GYPSY:
Well, thank you for sharing.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.233
BEARDALL:
You're welcome.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.642
MATTY:
I say let's get underground now.

19:13.727 --> 19:15.153
CARTER:
Let's do it.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.662
- MATTY: There he is.
- CARTER: Yeah, there he is.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.155
- Jeremiah! - All right.
- JEREMIAH: Howdy, everybody.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.331
CARTER:
I'm glad you made it up here.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.249
- Good to see you.
- Hey, uh, everybody,

19:28.333 --> 19:29.250
this is Jeremiah.

19:29.409 --> 19:31.335
Jeremiah, our mine guide,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.671
he's gonna help us
be safe going down the hole,

19:33.755 --> 19:35.923
and he's gonna help us be safe
inside the mine.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.675
He's-he's done this all
over the Western United States.

19:37.834 --> 19:38.918
- He does this for a living.
- MATTY: Wow.

19:39.002 --> 19:40.586
You know, we not got
a lot of time here.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.180
-JEREMIAH: Okay.
-We're burning daylight. I want to get going.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.848
So let's get you backed up

19:43.932 --> 19:45.507
and into place,
and, the rest of us, let's get

19:45.592 --> 19:47.593
- our gear ready and let's go from there.
- Yeah.

19:47.677 --> 19:48.811
- (others assenting)
- That's it.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.772
NARRATOR:
In Hoyt Peak, Utah,

19:51.857 --> 19:53.265
Matty Blake has joined

19:53.350 --> 19:56.268
treasure hunter Terry Carter
and his team

19:56.353 --> 19:59.113
to explore a mine that its owner
believes may contain

19:59.198 --> 20:03.451
$2.2 billion
in 18th century Spanish gold.

20:03.610 --> 20:05.527
- All right.
- CARTER: Matty.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.529
How you doing, everybody?
Looks like we're close.

20:07.614 --> 20:08.623
- We are.
- It looks like we're ready.

20:08.782 --> 20:11.033
- So how we gonna do this?
- So, Jeremiah

20:11.126 --> 20:12.785
is kind of our mine guide.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.629
Jeremiah, what you got in store
to keep us safe?

20:14.713 --> 20:16.705
- What do you got for us?
- Yeah.

20:16.790 --> 20:18.549
Well, let's do a safety briefing
really briefly.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.801
We're gonna want to watch
for anything we can fall on,

20:20.886 --> 20:24.129
slip on, uh, bump our head on.

20:24.214 --> 20:26.724
Another thing that we want to be
very careful of underground is

20:26.883 --> 20:29.218
the atmosphere. So we want
to make sure we're monitoring

20:29.302 --> 20:31.812
so that we have enough oxygen
and that we have, uh,

20:31.897 --> 20:34.556
no buildup of carbon monoxide
or other bad gases.

20:34.641 --> 20:36.475
So we have a 4-gas meter.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.819
You've got an additional meter
so we have extra backup.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.821
- I got one. Yeah.
- Fantastic.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.148
The other thing that we're gonna
be doing, just so we make sure

20:43.242 --> 20:46.327
that we can find our way out, is
we're gonna run a string line.

20:46.486 --> 20:47.403
That's gonna be
everybody's safety.

20:47.487 --> 20:48.988
Everyone can refer to it.

20:49.072 --> 20:50.414
It'll make us all feel
more comfortable.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.500
And we'll get that set up
when we get down there.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.243
MATTY: Here's
where it's getting tricky.

20:54.327 --> 20:56.170
I am definitely claustrophobic.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.838
Um...

20:57.923 --> 20:59.924
And... it's time.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.509
It's time to get ready
to go down there,

21:01.668 --> 21:03.085
and, uh, I'm fighting it.

21:03.169 --> 21:04.503
I'm fighting...

21:04.596 --> 21:06.672
(exhales)
my fear.

21:06.756 --> 21:08.015
It's like I know
I'm not gonna chicken out.

21:08.174 --> 21:09.100
I know I'm gonna do it.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.260
And so, right now,

21:11.353 --> 21:14.772
I'm making a decision
to focus on the mission

21:14.856 --> 21:17.933
and to focus on the minutiae
of tasks at hand.

21:18.018 --> 21:20.352
Okay. So everybody's comfortable
with the rules?

21:20.445 --> 21:21.362
- Yep.
- All right.

21:21.521 --> 21:22.438
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

21:22.522 --> 21:24.031
Okay, Quinn, you're up.

21:24.190 --> 21:26.275
- Let's do this.
- All right.

21:26.359 --> 21:29.695
NARRATOR: The team will begin
their exploration by using a winch

21:29.788 --> 21:32.790
- to lower themselves and their equipment...
- See you down there.

21:32.949 --> 21:35.200
through a mine entrance
originally used by

21:35.285 --> 21:38.871
treasure hunter Tom Beardall
in the early 1970s.

21:38.955 --> 21:41.707
The ladder was put
there after Gary was able

21:41.791 --> 21:43.634
to get the claim rights.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.470
So it's a way that they can
just easily get down there

21:46.629 --> 21:48.547
when they need to,
and the top is sealed

21:48.640 --> 21:50.883
for safety unless
they need to get in there.

21:50.967 --> 21:54.053
Okay, Quinn, GPR coming down!

21:54.137 --> 21:58.149
NARRATOR: Tom has claimed
that, while searching underground,

21:58.308 --> 22:00.309
he found a large
wooden door hidden deep

22:00.393 --> 22:02.644
in a cavern that he believes
was the entrance

22:02.729 --> 22:05.573
to the legendary
lost Josephine Mine.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.158
That all looks solid.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.651
NARRATOR: This door,
along with the potential riches

22:09.736 --> 22:11.746
that might lie behind it,
is what the team

22:11.830 --> 22:13.914
is hoping to find today.

22:14.074 --> 22:15.833
You're good to go.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.245
MATTY: Right off the
bat, it's nerve-racking

22:20.339 --> 22:23.499
because the first thing
you have to do is descend this

22:23.592 --> 22:27.336
really long ladder
into a very scary-looking hole.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.430
It's time.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.433
The entrance of this thing
looks like 10-X.

22:37.097 --> 22:39.607
Oh, you can feel
the temperature drop,

22:39.691 --> 22:40.691
that's for sure.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.529
Oh, my goodness.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.866
We are underground.

22:49.025 --> 22:50.868
(exhales)

22:54.864 --> 22:56.365
Wow.

22:56.449 --> 22:58.376
Harness coming back up!

23:06.876 --> 23:08.677
GYPSY:
All right.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.807
- Gypsy, you're doing great, pal.
- It's opening up a little.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.883
Yeah, you're at about six,
seven feet; you're fine.

23:14.968 --> 23:16.635
GYPSY:
I don't care for heights.

23:16.719 --> 23:20.722
And this ladder was
about 50 feet down.

23:20.807 --> 23:23.651
- So, it's a little scary.
- You're doing awesome.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.811
About ten more rungs,
you're home.

23:25.895 --> 23:29.565
GYPSY: But it didn't matter
how deep I was gonna have to go.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.734
I wanted to get down there
and find this door.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.829
I'm gonna unhook you.
You did it!

23:34.988 --> 23:36.905
- (Gypsy whoops) - All right,
I'm gonna send this back up.

23:36.990 --> 23:39.250
GYPSY:
Wow, it's different to see it

23:39.334 --> 23:40.492
- from this perspective.
- Yeah.

23:40.577 --> 23:42.077
You realize how far down we are,

23:42.162 --> 23:43.170
- and we're about to go further.
- When you're looking up?

23:43.329 --> 23:47.341
- Right?
- Oh, someone's coming down.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.511
- Welcome to the party, Jon.
- Yes.

23:50.670 --> 23:51.837
Hey, guys, here comes Terry.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.431
Oh, okay. Here you go, Terry.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.435
So, I'm getting my flare out
right now so we can start seeing

23:57.519 --> 24:00.179
where these airflows are,
so we know where to go.

24:00.263 --> 24:01.522
- The wind kicked up up there.
- Oh, good.

24:01.681 --> 24:03.348
So that's gonna help
the air movement

24:03.442 --> 24:06.944
- in here, so...
- Okay, we're getting some good visual.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.354
-Oh, man, look at that. It's working great.
-Okay.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.856
- Look at those heat signatures.
- Yes. Uh-huh.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.608
And so, what we want to do is

24:12.701 --> 24:13.609
look for these airflows,
like right there.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.703
- Right.
- We want to spot 'em.

24:15.862 --> 24:17.863
And we want to see if you have
a temperature change.

24:17.947 --> 24:19.698
So, see it's darkest
right there?

24:19.791 --> 24:21.450
And so, that's where it's gonna
be the coldest,

24:21.543 --> 24:23.702
so that's where the cold air is
coming from, is that direction.

24:23.786 --> 24:25.796
- Right there.
- So that's where we want to go.

24:25.955 --> 24:27.873
Watch out,
there's a drop-off right here.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.885
Ah, our fearless leader.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.137
All right, looks like
we all made it down safe, so

24:33.221 --> 24:34.889
I'm gonna go ahead and lay
our string line out,

24:34.973 --> 24:36.140
so we're gonna follow
this string.

24:36.299 --> 24:37.549
Everyone can see it.

24:37.634 --> 24:39.635
According to
the thermal imaging,

24:39.728 --> 24:41.145
we want to go that direction,

24:41.229 --> 24:43.481
so I'll follow you down
with the rope.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.065
Sounds good.
All right, everybody watch

24:45.150 --> 24:47.318
your footing
and let's walk carefully.

24:48.645 --> 24:50.488
♪ ♪

24:55.744 --> 24:59.988
There are holes all on your
right and your left as you

25:00.073 --> 25:03.000
make your way, and they go down
further than your eye can see.

25:03.084 --> 25:04.752
And they're tight.

25:04.911 --> 25:07.579
- Just follow the string, huh?
- Yep.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.089
If you took a misstep...

25:09.249 --> 25:10.666
(whistles)
you're going down,

25:10.759 --> 25:12.092
and you're gonna be trapped
like that.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.512
It is treacherous. It's no joke.

25:21.928 --> 25:24.346
- QUINN: Coming down.
- MATTY: Oh, man.

25:24.430 --> 25:28.767
- GYPSY: You okay, Matty?
- Eh... Focus on the mission.

25:28.851 --> 25:30.861
How you doing, Gypsy?

25:30.946 --> 25:33.522
It's good. There's a little bit
of a drop-off here.

25:33.606 --> 25:36.283
I got you. If you fall,
I got your backpack.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.035
All right, thank you.
I think I've got it.

25:38.194 --> 25:40.955
- All right.
- Teamwork. Thank you, guys.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.707
This way, Gypsy.

25:43.866 --> 25:45.617
- Hey, is that you, Quinn?
- That is.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.453
- All right, I made it down here.
- Been waiting on you.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.214
- Isn't this awesome?
- Yes.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.384
Yep, airflow is definitely this
way, you guys, we're doing good.

25:53.543 --> 25:55.294
Okay. So keep going.

25:55.378 --> 25:57.388
Keep to the left.
This is where the airflow is.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.392
Focus on the mission.

26:06.648 --> 26:07.973
Here I come.

26:08.057 --> 26:10.392
Okay, Matty, come down this way.

26:10.485 --> 26:12.394
The flow of air is
this direction.

26:12.478 --> 26:15.480
- Okay, I hear you.
- It really is a challenge.

26:15.565 --> 26:17.575
I have to calm myself.

26:18.985 --> 26:21.245
So it looks like
the airflow is coming from that

26:21.404 --> 26:24.740
direction when you follow
it that direction down there.

26:24.824 --> 26:26.584
- So let's keep going.
- GYPSY: Okay.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.252
Well, thanks, Jon.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.998
- MATTY: Oh, my God. Hey, Terry?
- Yeah?

26:33.091 --> 26:35.167
I think we found our wormhole.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.928
That's exactly what Tom said.
That's a good sign.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.931
We have to go forward.

26:46.346 --> 26:48.847
NARRATOR: More than 100 feet
under the ground

26:48.940 --> 26:51.358
- in Utah's Uinta Mountains...
- QUINN: Coming down.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.685
deep inside
an abandoned mine tunnel

26:53.770 --> 26:55.687
called the Pueblo Shaft,

26:55.772 --> 26:57.698
- Matty Blake...
- Equipment coming down.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.867
and a team of local
treasure hunters

26:59.951 --> 27:01.368
are searching for evidence of

27:01.453 --> 27:04.121
the legendary
lost Josephine Mine.

27:04.205 --> 27:07.791
- Tight squeeze.
- NARRATOR: They have just discovered a narrow opening

27:07.950 --> 27:10.035
that matches
a description given to them

27:10.128 --> 27:13.631
by a previous treasure hunter
named Tom Beardall.

27:13.715 --> 27:16.967
It is their hope that if
they can successfully navigate

27:17.052 --> 27:20.304
through it, they will
soon discover something else Tom

27:20.388 --> 27:24.808
claimed to have found more
than 40 years ago: a wooden door

27:24.893 --> 27:28.896
marking the entrance to a vast
treasure cache of Spanish gold.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.057
- CARTER: Hey, how's it looking?
- MATTY: Tight!

27:32.150 --> 27:34.401
Tom's story is that he
crawled through a wormhole,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.478
and he describes it
as very tight.

27:36.562 --> 27:38.489
Well, we've come upon it,

27:38.573 --> 27:41.492
and these little moments
of panic well up in you as

27:41.576 --> 27:44.569
you're crawling through
a space this big and you start

27:44.663 --> 27:46.655
to think bad thoughts.
I'm just focusing on what needs

27:46.739 --> 27:48.499
to be done, and that's
getting me through it.

27:51.661 --> 27:54.171
- Oh, no way.
- (Gypsy chuckles)

27:54.330 --> 27:56.840
Look at this space.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.426
- Oh, man.
- All right.

27:59.585 --> 28:04.089
All right, fellas, I'm through.

28:04.173 --> 28:06.425
This is unbelievable.

28:06.509 --> 28:08.185
- Definitely.
- Right?

28:09.354 --> 28:11.522
Matty, I'm proud of you.

28:11.606 --> 28:15.600
You made it through that
tight wormhole. Good job!

28:15.694 --> 28:18.195
I mean, I-I just, I want
to know from you and Terry

28:18.279 --> 28:20.605
if everything's still matching
up with Tom's story.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.775
So far it's matching up.
There's the wormhole.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.703
Then it opens to a room,
which we're in now.

28:25.862 --> 28:28.029
- Looks like a room to me.
- Yeah, we just need to follow

28:28.123 --> 28:30.198
those thermal flows, and I think

28:30.291 --> 28:32.033
- we'll still be on track.
- Great.

28:32.118 --> 28:34.044
Jeremiah, how you feeling?

28:34.129 --> 28:35.370
You're our leader. I mean,
how deep are we, do you think?

28:35.463 --> 28:37.297
I think we're about
200 feet below the surface

28:37.382 --> 28:40.217
- where we entered.
- Now I'm sorry I asked.

28:40.376 --> 28:42.461
- GYPSY: Wow.
- So let me look at the thermal.

28:42.545 --> 28:44.388
You picking up anything?

28:44.472 --> 28:47.975
Well, it looks like the thermal
is pointing in that direction,

28:48.059 --> 28:49.801
so that's where we need to go.

28:49.886 --> 28:51.470
- Right through there?
- Right through there.

28:51.554 --> 28:53.313
MATTY:
Oh, my gosh.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.308
CARTER: If you don't
have this modern technology,

28:56.401 --> 28:57.976
you're just gonna be digging
a lot of holes

28:58.060 --> 29:00.738
and guessing where you're at.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.732
You need this modern technology
to try and pinpoint

29:03.816 --> 29:07.578
and help you figure out
what your next move is.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.497
Jeremiah, how's our air looking?
What do you got for oxygen?

29:10.582 --> 29:13.575
- I got on mine 20.4.
- 20.3.

29:13.659 --> 29:15.753
Yep, mine just turned
to 20.3 and zero gases,

29:15.837 --> 29:17.996
so we're still good.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.998
I don't know if Tom told
you guys this or not,

29:20.082 --> 29:21.341
but he's told me in the past

29:21.426 --> 29:23.502
that when he crawled
through the wormhole,

29:23.586 --> 29:25.587
he came into a room,
and then he went down

29:25.671 --> 29:28.006
a boulder fill
on about a 45-degree angle

29:28.090 --> 29:29.424
that kind of spiraled down.

29:29.517 --> 29:32.102
And then it opened up
into a crevice.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.937
And he could walk through it
into the big room.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.430
And then he seen the door.

29:35.515 --> 29:37.357
Does that look like
it's a natural crevice?

29:37.442 --> 29:38.350
It looks like a natural crevice.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.935
It's all making sense.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.520
- It's matching.
- Yes.

29:41.604 --> 29:42.696
Man, if we can crawl through

29:42.781 --> 29:44.364
this crevice, man,
and find the door...

29:44.449 --> 29:46.575
- All right.
- Let's do it.

29:48.361 --> 29:50.788
MATTY: Following
the airflow is bringing us

29:50.872 --> 29:54.291
down a 45-degree angle,
exactly as Tom described it...

29:54.375 --> 29:56.043
GYSPY: This over
here looks a little steep.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.370
into this huge void space,

29:58.454 --> 30:00.130
exactly as he described it.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.216
CARTER: Man, this is just like
Tom says. You can walk in it.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.468
MATTY:
And if what he said is true,

30:04.552 --> 30:06.970
we're going to make our way
through this room right now,

30:07.055 --> 30:10.382
and at the end of it is
where they saw the door.

30:10.466 --> 30:13.635
- Matty! Gypsy! Jon!
- Coming.

30:13.719 --> 30:14.895
- GYPSY: What you got?
- JON: Oh, my goodness.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.888
Whoa!

30:16.981 --> 30:19.983
It looks like, to me, that
the ceiling is caved in

30:20.068 --> 30:22.561
right here, you can see
all the fresh dirt here.

30:22.654 --> 30:27.157
Man, we've seen everything
that Tom's seen,

30:27.316 --> 30:30.569
except for when we got
into this fissure,

30:30.662 --> 30:32.412
it was caved in.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.406
We-we couldn't go any farther.

30:34.490 --> 30:36.083
I'm speculating, y'all, that

30:36.242 --> 30:37.751
the tunnel kept on going
for Tom.

30:37.910 --> 30:39.586
This, to you, looks like,

30:39.671 --> 30:41.997
post-Tom,
something happened here

30:42.081 --> 30:43.248
- and collapsed.
- Something's happened here.

30:43.332 --> 30:46.009
So the door might be
right behind there.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.179
That's right. I still have
the thermal showing that we have

30:49.264 --> 30:50.755
- a flow coming through here still.
- Really?

30:50.849 --> 30:53.258
- Even with the cave-in, we still got it?
- Yeah.

30:53.351 --> 30:56.520
So, I'm thinking this
could lead to the big room.

30:56.679 --> 30:58.272
There's only one way
to find out.

30:58.431 --> 31:00.599
Let's get Jon's equipment

31:00.683 --> 31:03.351
- and figure this thing out.
- Hey, we lugged it down 250 feet

31:03.436 --> 31:05.112
- for a reason, right?
- That's right.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.865
Man, we've used GPR
on Oak Island

31:08.024 --> 31:09.941
but never in a space this tight,
I don't think.

31:10.026 --> 31:11.526
You want to handle the wheel?

31:11.619 --> 31:14.204
- I got the wheel.
- JON: We're using a 750 antenna.

31:14.363 --> 31:16.781
So, this particular
ground penetration radar

31:16.866 --> 31:18.959
will see up to about 20 feet,

31:19.043 --> 31:21.369
which should be enough
to see behind walls

31:21.454 --> 31:23.622
or behind boulders, and that
should give us the range

31:23.715 --> 31:25.299
- that we're looking for.
- Okay.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.709
Want to shift it over
and do it again?

31:27.793 --> 31:29.136
Yeah, shift it over
and do it again.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.638
Let's make sure
we got the same data.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.298
Some things that
you want to look for

31:33.382 --> 31:34.633
to know that there's a void

31:34.717 --> 31:36.727
is you look for a slight "U,"

31:36.811 --> 31:40.722
and you see a little bit
of a different signature.

31:40.806 --> 31:43.483
All right, okay, you guys,
it looks like we have

31:43.568 --> 31:47.070
a little bit of void signature
behind this boulder.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.147
Yes. You got a void, baby.

31:49.231 --> 31:51.909
So if we can drill through this

31:51.993 --> 31:54.736
and see what's behind there,
we may see a door.

31:54.820 --> 31:56.872
- Let's get it in there.
- All right.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.075
Jon, here's the water.

32:00.159 --> 32:02.744
Oh, beautiful.
So that's what we start with.

32:02.828 --> 32:06.173
As we go deeper and deeper,
we'll just add more

32:06.332 --> 32:07.916
and empty the core out.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.417
And we'll go
as far as we need to go

32:09.502 --> 32:11.753
- to see what's on the other side.
- Awesome.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.263
- All right, let's do this.
- MATTY: I'll stand out of your way here.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.181
JON:
Start the water.

32:18.260 --> 32:19.761
NARRATOR: To break
through the layers of rock

32:19.845 --> 32:21.262
blocking the team's path,

32:21.347 --> 32:24.524
Jon uses a custom-built,
in-cave drill rig.

32:24.684 --> 32:28.019
- I got some core samples here.
- NARRATOR: Powered by battery,

32:28.104 --> 32:30.522
its diamond-tipped bit
is capable of drilling

32:30.606 --> 32:33.108
through 80 feet of solid stone.

32:33.192 --> 32:36.861
We're drilling at 250 feet.
Not bad.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.947
All right, you guys,
let's add another pipe

32:39.031 --> 32:40.791
on here, so I have
a little more length.

32:40.950 --> 32:43.794
- Let's break through this bad boy.
- Let me help you.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.036
- Yep, we're good.
- Is that working?

32:45.121 --> 32:47.205
- (whirring)
- Okay, push.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.633
Keep pushing.

32:49.792 --> 32:52.552
That's it, keep it going.
Okay, more water.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.302
Okay, have we made it through?

33:01.387 --> 33:03.313
Get that core out.
There we go. Look at that.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.899
- That's the last piece, boys.
- Wow. You broke through.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.901
We are through.
Let's do this.

33:13.649 --> 33:16.827
Let's do this. Yeah,
let me get out my snake camera.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.495
Very excited.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.997
NARRATOR:
In Hoyt Peak, Utah,

33:20.156 --> 33:22.991
more than 250 feet
underground...

33:23.075 --> 33:24.668
Okay, so let me pull out
my phone

33:24.752 --> 33:26.003
- and push it on through.
- Yep, yep.

33:26.162 --> 33:29.748
Matty Blake and a team
of local treasure hunters

33:29.841 --> 33:32.426
are exploring an area they
believe may lie just outside

33:32.510 --> 33:36.346
the entrance to the legendary
lost Josephine Mine.

33:36.505 --> 33:39.766
Okay, push it on through.
Oh, yeah, there we go.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.177
NARRATOR: Having
just drilled through a layer

33:42.261 --> 33:44.771
of fallen rock blocking
their path,

33:44.930 --> 33:47.599
the team may be just a few steps
away from a wooden door

33:47.683 --> 33:50.110
they were told guards
the mine's treasure vault

33:50.194 --> 33:55.106
and more than $2.2 billion
in Spanish gold and silver.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.692
Hey, I just felt it give.
I think it broke through, guys.

33:57.777 --> 33:59.703
- CARTER: Are you serious?
- Yeah.

33:59.862 --> 34:02.363
- I-I see some opening there, wow.
- Oh, sweet.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.374
All right, I'll try
and guide it.

34:04.533 --> 34:05.784
You guys call it out,
I'll try and guide it.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.702
JON:
Keep it going.

34:07.787 --> 34:09.546
CARTER:
Wait, wait a minute.

34:09.705 --> 34:12.290
Stop! Hold it, Matty.
Hold it right there.

34:12.374 --> 34:14.292
Look at that, look at that.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.628
GYPSY: Now, that's
a very big void right there.

34:16.712 --> 34:18.055
- Yeah, there's some void over there.
- CARTER: So, I can see

34:18.214 --> 34:20.515
it's a big void,
but I'm not seeing the door.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.301
MATTY:
No door? Can I turn it?

34:23.394 --> 34:24.969
- CARTER: Yeah, try turning it.
- JON: Yeah, try turning it.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.055
- CARTER: Try turning it.
- MATTY: All right, how's-how's that?

34:28.557 --> 34:30.484
JON: That's better. I can see
more down the-- well, let's see.

34:30.568 --> 34:31.735
CARTER:
Turn it a little more.

34:34.396 --> 34:38.316
JON: There we go, see, see
the void there behind that boulder.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.401
Yeah. It's just too far, though.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.245
Yeah, guys,
I can feel definitely

34:42.330 --> 34:44.414
that I've broken through,
but it's actually making

34:44.499 --> 34:46.583
the-the camera harder
to control.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.160
It's kind of dropping
outside the end of the hole.

34:49.245 --> 34:52.497
NARRATOR: Although drilling into
a void behind the caved-in boulders

34:52.590 --> 34:55.166
blocking their path
offers the team great hope

34:55.259 --> 34:59.179
that they may be within mere
feet of a major discovery,

34:59.263 --> 35:02.599
unfortunately,
at least for today,

35:02.683 --> 35:05.927
they are not equipped to go
any further to confirm it.

35:06.011 --> 35:08.438
This team got further
in the Josephine Mine

35:08.523 --> 35:10.273
than anyone else has been.

35:10.432 --> 35:14.018
They corroborated Tom's story
to the step.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.779
You know, I'm really excited
how far we got

35:15.938 --> 35:17.856
and that we were able
to break through and prove

35:17.949 --> 35:20.617
that Tom was right--
There's a room back there.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.703
When you get that close
to potential treasure,

35:23.788 --> 35:25.613
you want to dig.

35:25.698 --> 35:27.532
CARTER:
Well, I think we got enough here

35:27.625 --> 35:30.535
that we need to dig down later

35:30.619 --> 35:33.371
and follow this crevice down
to see if we can't get into

35:33.455 --> 35:36.299
- the big room and the big, the big door. Yeah.
- MATTY: Okay.

35:36.458 --> 35:39.711
So, I'm gonna start
retracting it, okay?

35:39.804 --> 35:42.222
- Okay. - Okay.
- You got enough-enough images?

35:42.306 --> 35:44.716
Yeah, oh, yeah. You know,
I'm convinced enough

35:44.800 --> 35:47.051
that we want to get
to the other side of this thing

35:47.145 --> 35:50.388
because I'm pretty sure
that's where the door would be.

35:50.472 --> 35:52.307
GYPSY: We have to figure
this has been many years

35:52.400 --> 35:55.059
since Tom had eyewitness
to this door,

35:55.153 --> 35:58.229
and there's bound to have been
earth shifts, cave-ins,

35:58.314 --> 36:01.575
so we felt like we were close
to this door,

36:01.659 --> 36:03.660
but still it was beyond reach.

36:03.819 --> 36:05.579
This is probably
as much as we can do today.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.989
MATTY: Oh, my gosh. You guys,
yeah, we've been down here hours.

36:08.082 --> 36:09.916
- JON: Yeah, we've got to get out.
- MATTY: All right. Uh, okay.

36:10.075 --> 36:12.335
Before we head out, I...
Can we look at that footage?

36:12.420 --> 36:14.329
-JON: Yeah, let me get it here.
-MATTY: All right. Let's bring it over here.

36:14.413 --> 36:16.664
- Look at that.
- See, I was operating,

36:16.757 --> 36:19.167
- so I couldn't see any of this.
- Oh, wow.

36:19.251 --> 36:22.679
MATTY: Look at that. Now, you
can see it's about to break through.

36:22.838 --> 36:25.089
That's where I felt it break
through, right about there.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.184
- Yup.
- JON: Look at that void.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.101
- JEREMIAH: Yeah, that's gorgeous.
- CARTER: Oh, wow!

36:28.260 --> 36:29.102
GYPSY:
See that void?

36:29.261 --> 36:31.021
MATTY:
It's huge.

36:31.105 --> 36:34.274
- I mean, you've got something going on there.
- Yeah.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.851
JON: The camera
can see close to 40 feet

36:36.936 --> 36:39.112
as long as light can
reach that far.

36:39.271 --> 36:42.115
- Look at this.
- The problem in this case was the lighting.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.610
So we were only able
to see maybe ten feet,

36:45.703 --> 36:47.954
but it was enough to see
that the chamber opened up

36:48.113 --> 36:50.040
big enough for someone
to fit through

36:50.124 --> 36:51.875
and to get further up
the chamber.

36:52.034 --> 36:53.960
Jeremiah, you've-you've seen...
you've seen this

36:54.045 --> 36:55.462
your whole career.
I mean, do you think...

36:55.546 --> 36:57.047
Would you want to explore
more there?

36:57.131 --> 36:59.123
Yeah, I definitely would.
Following the narrative

36:59.208 --> 37:00.625
and following the evidence,

37:00.709 --> 37:02.636
I definitely would want to get
behind that rock.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.888
- That's incredible.
- Yeah.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.215
I mean, everything fit
along the way. Right, Gypsy?

37:07.299 --> 37:09.384
- Definitely.
- Like, we followed the air.

37:09.468 --> 37:11.978
Every void seemed to match
his story.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.064
I was becoming more and more
convinced as we went.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.723
And I wasn't exactly comfortable
down here the whole time,

37:15.816 --> 37:17.651
but I kept wanting
to move forward

37:17.810 --> 37:18.902
because everything was fitting.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.570
- Right?
- OTHERS: Yeah.

37:20.729 --> 37:21.980
So, I'd love to see
you guys get back down here.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.823
I know the team would.

37:23.983 --> 37:26.985
And I think if there's gold
anywhere, it's right there.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.496
I think it's an amazing thing
you guys have done.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.414
It's an amazing thing
what you guys have done.

37:31.573 --> 37:35.085
Bringing the technology in here
that we haven't had.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.420
So I'm just excited
for everybody,

37:37.505 --> 37:40.423
and I'm grateful to be
a part of this.

37:40.582 --> 37:42.000
I've said it a million times,
there's, like,

37:42.093 --> 37:43.677
two types of people: people
who can hear these stories

37:43.836 --> 37:44.919
and just go on with their lives,

37:45.004 --> 37:46.012
and the people
who hear these stories

37:46.097 --> 37:47.171
and got to know more.

37:47.256 --> 37:48.765
And I tend to gravitate and bond

37:48.849 --> 37:50.508
with those type of people.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.011
All right, well, I mean, I've
actually had a blast down here,

37:53.104 --> 37:54.846
but I also wouldn't mind being
aboveground

37:54.930 --> 37:56.856
because this is not
my natural habitat--

37:56.941 --> 37:58.191
- 250 feet underground.
- (chuckles): Right?

37:58.276 --> 38:00.518
So if our leader could
lead us out, please.

38:00.602 --> 38:02.737
- All right, let's get out of here.
- MATTY: All right.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.451
MARTY: Matty Blake,
I have one question for you.

38:16.535 --> 38:19.045
Is the lost Josephine Mine
still lost?

38:19.204 --> 38:20.204
Or did you find it?

38:20.298 --> 38:22.290
Oh, man.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.042
- That's the question, right?
- Yeah.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.386
I think they're close.
I think they're real close.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.637
I think, I think
they might be on it.

38:27.796 --> 38:29.797
So, how close were you
to the door?

38:29.890 --> 38:31.883
We think we were right there.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.886
The very last place we could be,
where the door supposedly was,

38:34.979 --> 38:36.479
there's a collapse.
That's kind of weird.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.640
I didn't see any other collapses
blocking any other entrances.

38:39.725 --> 38:41.225
Oh, you think it might have
been intentional.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.643
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

38:42.728 --> 38:44.404
Maybe someone else knew
that door was there.

38:44.563 --> 38:46.898
Or maybe someone else tried
to breach it or something.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.816
And just said,
"We're gonna leave this here,

38:48.909 --> 38:50.068
and we'll come back
and we'll get it."

38:50.152 --> 38:52.236
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't know.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.915
Well, guys, uh,
Terry and Gary are standing by,

38:56.075 --> 38:58.918
- and they actually have footage for us to look at.
- Oh, great.

38:59.078 --> 39:00.503
- MATTY: So...
- Well, let's get 'em on the phone.

39:02.664 --> 39:04.082
- Hello, guys.
- RICK: Hey, guys.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.343
<i>How you guys doing?
Matty, how you doing?</i>

39:06.502 --> 39:08.336
- (laughter)
- Oh, I'm still queasy.

39:08.420 --> 39:10.180
<i>(Carter laughs)</i>

39:10.339 --> 39:12.349
I just got some things
I want to show you guys.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.933
<i>I know Rick and Marty,
you're probably dying</i>

39:14.018 --> 39:15.593
<i>to see what happened down there.</i>

39:15.677 --> 39:17.187
- There you go.
- All right.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.598
Here's-here's what
we was looking at

39:20.691 --> 39:22.359
down through the hole.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.606
This actually looks way better
than when I saw it.

39:28.690 --> 39:30.608
It was hard to see down there

39:30.701 --> 39:33.036
in the cavern
while looking at a monitor.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.704
You know, this I can really see.
Wow.

39:36.532 --> 39:39.200
<i>We can see that
there is a tunnel</i>

39:39.293 --> 39:40.535
<i>still going on from there.</i>

39:40.628 --> 39:41.953
So, what we're looking at
right now,

39:42.037 --> 39:43.880
that's the last shot
of that snake camera,

39:43.964 --> 39:46.874
and there's an opening there,
so that would be the room

39:46.959 --> 39:49.386
that Tom reported
and that door could be

39:49.545 --> 39:51.379
right over that rock
right there, correct?

39:51.463 --> 39:53.723
<i>- Yep.</i>
- MARTY: Oh, boy.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.550
- You were close.
- So close.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.227
<i>CARTER:
We're close. We just got</i>

39:57.311 --> 39:59.562
some excavation we got to do
to see where this thing leads.

39:59.721 --> 40:02.723
- When's the plan to do that?
<i>- ASAP.</i>

40:02.808 --> 40:04.567
(laughter)

40:04.726 --> 40:06.820
It's an incredible story
Tom tells about this,

40:06.904 --> 40:09.397
and he deserves to be able to
at least see this door

40:09.490 --> 40:10.815
<i>on video if nothing else.</i>

40:10.899 --> 40:12.984
There's a human component to it.

40:13.077 --> 40:16.070
Terry was just articulating
that, you know,

40:16.155 --> 40:18.573
the door and-and what may lay
beyond the door

40:18.657 --> 40:21.492
is every bit as exciting
as when they first found out

40:21.585 --> 40:23.837
about the mine,
but the compelling thing is

40:23.921 --> 40:25.913
that I want to do it for Tom.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.173
I want Tom to see the door.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.592
I mean, here
on Oak Island, right?

40:29.751 --> 40:31.761
Yes, there is a huge
treasure component to it,

40:31.920 --> 40:34.839
but it's also about
paying respect to the people

40:34.923 --> 40:37.350
that have come before us
wanting to know that,

40:37.435 --> 40:39.769
you know, what Dan Blankenship
sought all those years

40:39.928 --> 40:42.096
is still there,
it's still viable.

40:42.181 --> 40:45.525
So, that's what
I find interesting.

40:45.609 --> 40:48.027
- It's not just treasure.
- Right.

40:48.187 --> 40:49.937
Well, I agree with you 100%.

40:50.022 --> 40:52.365
You know, it's-it's the treasure
that gets you there.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.775
<i>But even if there's no treasure
behind this door,</i>

40:54.860 --> 40:56.527
<i>that door is a treasure.</i>

40:56.612 --> 40:58.696
That'll do. (chuckles)

40:58.789 --> 41:01.207
Well, I mean, I think
you can feel Terry's energy,

41:01.292 --> 41:03.951
and working with him
was just awesome.

41:04.036 --> 41:06.621
The whole team, I just want
to thank you guys

41:06.705 --> 41:09.215
for this incredible experience,
and I-I hope we can stay

41:09.374 --> 41:11.384
in touch with you guys
and-and see what's next to try

41:11.469 --> 41:14.053
and find that door right
through that hole hopefully.

41:14.213 --> 41:15.555
Man, I think we'd love that,

41:15.639 --> 41:17.474
and, man, we thank you
for bringing your expertise.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.799
It was a big help.

41:18.884 --> 41:21.052
MARTY: Well, guys,
if we can help any more,

41:21.136 --> 41:22.553
we-we certainly will.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.063
And this time,
Rick and I might tag along,

41:24.223 --> 41:25.982
- so...
- Might?

41:26.066 --> 41:27.817
- (laughter)
- Yeah.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.311
<i>Sounds, sounds great, man, and
we appreciate all your help.</i>

41:30.404 --> 41:32.230
- And thank you guys.
- MARTY: Thank you.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.573
- Pleasure to know you.
- Thank you for sharing the story.

41:33.657 --> 41:34.908
- See you guys.
- Take care, guys.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.828
Well, there you have it.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.322
That's a life changer. That was,
that was an experience, man.

41:41.406 --> 41:43.500
That was incredible,
and I just hope they can do it.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.743
One chapter closed,

41:45.827 --> 41:47.003
- another chapter begins.
- Yeah.

41:47.162 --> 41:49.422
And, I mean,
one of these, just one,

41:49.581 --> 41:52.342
we've got to hit a big cache
of treasure just one time.

41:52.426 --> 41:53.834
- I'm actually hoping it's here.
- (chuckles): Yes.

41:53.919 --> 41:55.178
- Let's start with this, okay?
- Okay.

41:55.337 --> 41:57.421
- Fair enough.
- Let's go. Let's go start now.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.924
MATTY: No more tight spaces,
though, for a while, guys.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.351
(laughter)
