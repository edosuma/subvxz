00:00.667 --> 00:02.768
<i>Previously on</i> gotham...

00:02.770 --> 00:04.770
Listen, there are
things I need to do.
If you stay, I stay.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.971
Zsasz:
<i>My name is victor zsasz.</i>

00:06.974 --> 00:09.842
I'm here for jim gordon.
Everybody out.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.311
Essen:
<i>There's not a single cop</i>
<i>in this city</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:13.379
<i>Who'll help you.</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:15.214
I won't help you.
I'm not leaving.

00:17.984 --> 00:19.952
You don't have to join me.
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.

00:19.954 --> 00:21.620
<i>I might as well
join the good guys.</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.355
Mooney:
<i>I ain't looking for no girl.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.790
<i>I'm looking for a weapon.</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:26.625
Excuse me.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.660
You want to start a war
over this punk?

00:28.662 --> 00:30.062
The little guy amuses me.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.663
Falcone:
<i>Why go to war over trifles?</i>

00:31.665 --> 00:32.731
We'll let you have him.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.566
Our gift to you.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.141
(panting quietly)

00:45.211 --> 00:47.613
Oh, god, oh, god.

(seagulls screeching)

01:56.150 --> 01:57.449
(coffee spills)
oh.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.718
Hell of a way
to start the day.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.253
I mean, I just cleaned this.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.554
Harvey.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.789
Hey.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.990
Uniforms found the body.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.893
No wallet,
no id, no watch.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.627
He got beaten
up pretty good.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.263
I'm guessing the cause of
death is that gigantic gash

02:11.265 --> 02:12.764
In the side
of his neck.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.433
You think? What's all
the black on him?

02:14.435 --> 02:15.767
Ink? Paint?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.269
Hmm.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.271
Good morning, ed.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.771
Detective.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.007
Going by overall coagulation,

02:22.009 --> 02:25.110
I'd say time of death
is midnight. But...

02:25.112 --> 02:26.745
He's only been here
for a couple hours.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.514
Rats have just
started on his ears.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.182
Sneaky little buggers.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.184
So, not a mugging.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.584
Muggers don't
move the body.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.820
Abrasions on
his knuckles...

02:34.822 --> 02:36.155
Put up a fight.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.090
Yeah.
Look at the suspenders.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.625
I'm guessing he's
some kind of finance guy.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.461
Maybe it was an abduction
ransom thing gone wrong.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.163
He resists,
ka-chunk!

02:44.165 --> 02:46.165
Do you want to talk to the
uniforms that found the body?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.466
Uh, you do it.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.634
We should canvass

02:48.636 --> 02:50.302
The area, though;
a lot of homeless around here.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.537
I'll get some unis on it.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.771
I'll handle it myself.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.306
Hey, joe!

02:54.308 --> 02:56.441
Go smoke somewhere else, huh?

02:56.443 --> 02:57.809
Come on, jim, that's what
we got uniforms for.

02:57.811 --> 02:58.811
Let them do it.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.379
And I'd rather handle it myself.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.547
Detectives...

03:01.549 --> 03:03.215
I'm guessing I should run
all the prints?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.717
Yeah, ed,
run the prints.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.785
This one, too?

03:12.892 --> 03:15.360
Yeah, ed, that one, too.

03:18.798 --> 03:21.633
It wasn't even a proper yacht.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.602
No, it's more like a dinghy.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.639
Can I help you?

03:27.641 --> 03:29.808
What a lovely brooch.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.076
Thank you.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.412
May I have it?

03:33.414 --> 03:34.580
(laughs)

03:34.582 --> 03:37.849
I have a friend
who would love that.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.818
Excuse me?
Oh...

03:39.820 --> 03:40.986
(laughing)

03:40.988 --> 03:43.922
I'm sorry.

03:43.924 --> 03:47.259
May I please have it?

03:53.666 --> 03:55.100
You shouldn't have.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.602
Oswald:
I wanted to
make a gesture.

03:56.604 --> 03:59.104
I hope, in time,

03:59.106 --> 04:00.439
We can be friends.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.673
Friends?

04:01.675 --> 04:03.175
Hmm.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.743
Sure.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.211
Why not?
What's done is done.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.513
I'm so glad you feel that way.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.415
Don maroni
wants us

04:10.417 --> 04:12.184
To clarify terms.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.752
Well, it's business as usual.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.521
Maroni still has
his drugs, his unions.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.690
He pays tariff
for the ports.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.958
If he needs favors
from the cops

04:19.959 --> 04:22.928
Or the mayor,
don falcone will consider it.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.897
And, of course, the families
still share arkham.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.367
And there is to be no blood
spilled on either side.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.801
Not a drop.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.203
Hmm...

04:31.205 --> 04:33.438
Maybe just a drop.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.040
(laughing)

04:35.042 --> 04:36.708
(clucks tongue)

04:36.710 --> 04:37.776
(laughing)

04:37.778 --> 04:39.077
Look at you.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.412
Timothy,

04:40.414 --> 04:44.716
Do you know this fellow
used to have your job?

04:44.718 --> 04:47.719
Carried my umbrella
and thought it an honor.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.055
Now look at him.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.556
Has a seat at the table.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.458
Things change, eh?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.427
I've been blessed.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.963
Perhaps I should open your gift.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.201
(gasps)

05:04.170 --> 05:06.605
My goodness.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.807
That is beautiful.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.575
Now I feel

05:10.577 --> 05:11.777
Awful.

05:11.779 --> 05:12.778
I didn't get you anything.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.313
No.

05:15.581 --> 05:16.648
Thank you.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.160
Hmm.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.162
Sweet.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.696
That was uncalled for.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.364
I brought you
into my family

05:32.366 --> 05:34.199
And I treated you like a son!

05:34.201 --> 05:35.201
And you betrayed me.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.601
For which I suffered.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.669
Not enough.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.971
When I order some fool killed,

05:39.973 --> 05:42.374
I expect him to stay that way.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.042
Your boss, don falcone,

05:44.044 --> 05:45.210
Expressly said...

05:45.212 --> 05:46.611
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he wants peace.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.947
He's the only reason
why your ass is still alive.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.649
And if I were you,
I would

05:50.651 --> 05:54.219
<i>Pray</i> for his good health.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.354
(laughing)

05:55.356 --> 05:57.022
Oh, I do.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.690
I do.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.158
Good.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.860
'cause remember...

06:03.296 --> 06:05.397
...Things change.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.833
Convey my respects to your don.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.134
Likewise.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.536
Peace...

06:11.538 --> 06:12.771
Friend.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.652
(school bell ringing)

06:27.654 --> 06:30.155
(children talking, laughing)

06:30.157 --> 06:31.490
Alfred:
Come now, master bruce.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.859
Had to happen sooner or later.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.594
Is this really necessary?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.162
Homeschooling is
just as effective.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.330
I can show you the data.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.399
You need to be around children
your own age.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.504
Why?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.005
'cause you do.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.774
You know I despise
that sort of answer.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.942
Don't you miss your mates?

06:50.944 --> 06:53.178
Not really.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.781
I've always found them
kind of childish.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.382
Well, that's what they're
meant to be, aren't they?

06:57.384 --> 06:58.617
That's what they do.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.053
Don't you want to be

07:02.055 --> 07:03.221
Like a normal kid?

07:03.223 --> 07:05.223
I'm not sure.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.859
Define "normal"
and make a good case for it.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.628
You're going to bloody school.
(bell tolling)

07:09.630 --> 07:10.996
Now start walking.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.808
Good luck, lad.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.245
Gordon: Very sorry
for your loss, ma'am.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.380
Can you think of anyone

07:28.382 --> 07:29.781
Who would want to hurt
your son coleman?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.982
No, sir.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.451
Nobody.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.985
He was a good boy.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.320
Yes, ma'am, I can see that.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.556
No arrests.
An honest young man.

07:38.558 --> 07:39.891
What did he do for a living?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.060
Uh, he worked in a coffee shop.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.229
When we found him,
he was in a suit.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.297
Suspenders.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.466
He was looking for
a job in finance.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.468
He was very ambitious.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.404
First in our family
to go to college.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.072
(crying):
Who would do this, sir?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.273
Why?

07:55.275 --> 07:56.715
We'll do our best
to find out, ma'am.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.744
Gordon's finishing up
with the mother.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.480
So far, nothing off
the severed thumb

08:01.482 --> 08:03.114
And none of the city's ers
have seen any thumbless guys.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.250
You think he went black market?

08:05.252 --> 08:07.018
That's next on my list.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.153
How's gordon?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.155
Angry.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.322
How would you feel if every cop

08:10.324 --> 08:11.456
In the building ran out on you?

08:11.458 --> 08:13.358
And now they
all treat him

08:13.360 --> 08:14.759
Like he's got the plague,

08:14.761 --> 08:15.961
'cause seeing him reminds them

08:15.963 --> 08:17.329
Of what cowards they all are.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.032
I'm sorry, cap, I...

08:21.034 --> 08:22.200
I didn't mean you.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.269
Nope.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.304
You're right.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.772
But he's gotta get over that.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.542
Can't do this
job alone.

08:30.544 --> 08:33.178
Lucky he's got you.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.946
Yeah.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.183
♪ ♪

08:39.186 --> 08:40.186
(gasps)

08:40.187 --> 08:42.554
So beautiful.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.121
As soon as I saw it,

08:44.124 --> 08:45.323
I thought of you.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.359
Such a good son.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.295
Put it on, put it on.
Oh...

08:50.297 --> 08:52.130
(gasps)

08:52.132 --> 08:54.165
Wh-what happened?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.300
Who did this?

08:55.302 --> 08:56.368
N-nobody.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.036
It's just a scratch.
It's...

08:58.038 --> 08:59.371
Is your mother a fool?

08:59.373 --> 09:01.306
No. Someone

09:01.308 --> 09:03.575
Is being mean to my boy.
Hey.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.744
It's a tough business.

09:05.746 --> 09:09.481
The restaurant business
is so tough these days?

09:09.483 --> 09:10.982
Why is that?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.651
My success makes
other people envious.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.320
So tell the boss
on these people.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.655
This person isn't

09:16.657 --> 09:18.657
Scared of the boss.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.825
Not like they should be.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.160
I don't know why.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.395
I know.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.163
When I was
in school,

09:25.165 --> 09:28.266
Magda himmelfarb

09:28.268 --> 09:31.670
Was so mean to me

09:31.672 --> 09:34.339
And teacher did nothing.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.507
Why?

09:35.509 --> 09:36.509
Because

09:36.510 --> 09:39.511
Such a good dancer I was.

09:39.513 --> 09:40.845
And magda,

09:40.847 --> 09:42.714
With her nice hair

09:42.716 --> 09:44.049
And her big bosoms,

09:44.051 --> 09:46.051
A carthorse.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.519
I meant...

09:47.521 --> 09:49.020
Why did the teacher do nothing?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.056
Why you
think?

09:51.058 --> 09:53.525
"private lessons," they said.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.060
I put

09:55.062 --> 09:56.728
Stop to that.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.196
You told on them?

09:58.198 --> 09:59.364
Oh, no.

09:59.366 --> 10:03.368
I denounced magda's father

10:03.370 --> 10:05.604
To secret police.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.906
(trap snaps, rodent squeals)

10:07.908 --> 10:09.474
Ah...

10:09.476 --> 10:11.209
Three weeks he's been

10:11.211 --> 10:14.479
Turning up his nose at my traps,

10:14.481 --> 10:16.548
And now, now,
today, a smidge

10:16.550 --> 10:18.717
Of camembert

10:18.719 --> 10:19.951
And mr. Rat,

10:19.953 --> 10:22.387
He cannot
resist.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.322
No. Oh, can you?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.724
Can you,
my little

10:25.726 --> 10:27.959
Greedy baby?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.462
I found out your secret!

10:30.464 --> 10:33.231
Yes.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.467
Everybody has a secret.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.404
(screaming)

10:39.406 --> 10:41.406
Morphine!

10:41.408 --> 10:42.807
Morphine!

10:43.809 --> 10:46.611
They teach you that
in med school?

10:46.613 --> 10:48.346
Oh...

10:48.348 --> 10:49.848
Bullock.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.249
Is that kenny suffield?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.484
Smash and grab guy.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.485
Also a real hound
with the ladies.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.586
Who shot him?

10:54.588 --> 10:55.920
I don't ask.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.355
Well, me and my partner
doing all the rounds

10:57.357 --> 10:58.590
Of you black market sawbones.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.625
Guy we're looking for

11:00.627 --> 11:02.093
Would've come in
early this morning

11:02.095 --> 11:04.295
Missing a thumb.
Sorry.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.830
You'd tell us if you knew,
wouldn't you, doc?

11:05.832 --> 11:06.998
I mean,
that's the deal, right?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.334
You give us info
and we let you keep operating?

11:09.336 --> 11:12.337
That's a pun. Operating.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.206
Bullock, black ink,

11:15.208 --> 11:16.675
Just like on the victim.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.643
Oh, doc.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.679
Fine.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.714
He came in about 3:00
this morning.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.015
Didn't give a name,

11:24.017 --> 11:25.884
But this dropped
out of his pocket.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.520
Sionis investments.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.487
What'd he look like?

11:29.489 --> 11:30.655
Mid-20s.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.457
Suit, suspenders.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.992
Just like our dead guy.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.494
Sorry, doc.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.063
This is gordon.
I need an ambulance

11:38.065 --> 11:41.499
And a black and white
at 1856 wilton.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.901
Wait!

11:42.903 --> 11:45.136
Just... Wait a second.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.871
Just get me alvarez,
will you?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.907
Alvarez: Bullock, bullock,
what the hell, man?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.675
I got a deal with that guy.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.477
Deal's off.
But I told you everything.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.145
Yeah, after we
caught you in a lie.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.346
He always lies.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.815
You just squeeze him.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.817
You're screwing
the rest of us.
Oh, yeah?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.318
How's that feel? You like it?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.419
Hey, enough, enough!

12:01.421 --> 12:02.854
I get it, I get it, huh?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.256
None of these sons of bitches
had your back when it mattered,

12:05.258 --> 12:06.391
But where was I?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.659
I was there, remember?

12:07.661 --> 12:09.394
Falcone, the mayor,
blaze of glory?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.196
Be nice for my sake.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.331
I am being nice.
Haven't you learned
your lesson?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.900
We're only alive
because falcone let us live.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.669
You got to go along
to get along, jim.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.671
No, I don't.
You think locking up

12:19.673 --> 12:22.340
Doc scumbag there
is gonna make a difference?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.409
I'm on your side.
I proved that.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.078
Yeah, you did.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.580
So I'm asking you, please,

12:28.582 --> 12:31.282
Let the doc out and tomorrow,

12:31.284 --> 12:32.784
You and I will go check out

12:32.786 --> 12:35.186
This sionis investments
together.

12:40.626 --> 12:41.960
All right, partner?

12:43.529 --> 12:45.764
Sorry, harv.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.734
This ain't right, harvey.

12:49.736 --> 12:52.303
Alvarez, put a zipper on it!

13:00.546 --> 13:02.614
(door closes)

13:06.619 --> 13:08.219
(gun clicks)

13:08.221 --> 13:09.721
(gasps)
jim.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.055
Barbara, what are you...

13:11.057 --> 13:12.924
I heard someone come in,
and you didn't turn

13:12.926 --> 13:14.392
On the light...
So you got out my spare?

13:14.394 --> 13:15.460
You were late!

13:15.462 --> 13:16.895
I got nervous.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.563
God.
Not the best idea

13:18.565 --> 13:20.665
To be handling a firearm
when you've been drinking.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.636
I'm sorry.

13:26.071 --> 13:29.140
Look, you've been
through a lot.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.742
It's over now.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.911
I am scared, jim.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.013
Everywhere I go, I can...

13:35.015 --> 13:38.316
I can feel that monster, zsasz,

13:38.318 --> 13:40.718
Stalking me, and I...
He's not a monster.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.389
He's just a man.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.926
I won't let anyone hurt you.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.495
How can you promise me that?

13:52.932 --> 13:55.500
Tell me it'll be okay.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.202
(sighs)

13:57.204 --> 14:00.071
Tell me there really aren't
any monsters.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.043
Just...

14:05.045 --> 14:07.712
Lie if you have to.

14:08.647 --> 14:11.249
There aren't any monsters.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.170
When are we gonna
get out of here?

14:32.172 --> 14:34.572
That's up to you.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.115
Morning.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.484
(sighing):
Hey.

14:46.486 --> 14:50.088
I didn't think you were up.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.923
Look, last night was
just nerves...

14:51.925 --> 14:54.225
And way too much to drink.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.429
I said I wanted half your life,
and I've got it.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.400
Leave the gun.

15:17.783 --> 15:19.284
I wish it wasn't like this.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.518
Do you really?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.220
(sighs)

15:22.222 --> 15:24.389
Ignore me. I'm just tired.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.690
Go.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.026
Catch some bad guys.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.595
(softly):
Okay.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.702
(door opens)

15:37.704 --> 15:39.337
(glove snaps)

15:40.806 --> 15:43.808
Forensic examination
by edward nygma,

15:43.810 --> 15:45.877
8:42 a.M., gcpd morgue.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.780
The room is approximately
19 degrees celsius.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.648
I ate half
a cranberry muffin earlier,

15:50.650 --> 15:52.116
Saving the rest for later.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.398
What do a dead man,
a cruise ship

16:07.400 --> 16:08.833
And emu have in common?

16:11.103 --> 16:13.171
Correct, nothing.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.813
Ever more curious.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.715
Medical examiner:
He what?!

16:25.617 --> 16:27.251
Nygma, how many times
have I told you

16:27.253 --> 16:28.586
To stay the hell out of here?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.121
But I discovered something.
You'll discover

16:30.123 --> 16:31.990
Your butt in the street
if you keep doing this.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.825
Out.

16:37.529 --> 16:38.997
Your loss.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.566
You sloppy ignoramus.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.438
Hi, bruce.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.440
Hi.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.612
Brucey, how you doing?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.314
Tommy, hey.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.815
I'm well, how are you?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.517
You know, chilling.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.588
So, uh, your mom and dad
got killed, huh?

17:05.223 --> 17:07.058
Yes.
You see the whole thing?

17:07.060 --> 17:08.859
The blood and everything?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.795
I'd rather not talk about that.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.963
I was just interested.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.897
I've never seen
a real dead body.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.800
Was there guts?

17:18.170 --> 17:19.971
I'll be going to class now.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.144
(bell tolling)

17:37.689 --> 17:39.590
Forgive me, mother,
for I have sinned.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.825
Mooney:
Funny.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.595
It feels weird, meeting here.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.731
You don't want anyone
to see us together.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.667
Falcone has his eyes everywhere.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.670
So, where are we?

17:52.672 --> 17:53.871
I cook for him,

17:53.873 --> 17:55.506
I sing to him,

17:55.508 --> 17:56.908
We go on walks.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.677
I don't know whether
I'm his maid, his lover

17:59.679 --> 18:01.045
Or his mother.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.447
Or all three.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.882
He cares about you.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.084
Yeah.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.218
Hmm.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.053
Have you been
inside his private office?

18:09.055 --> 18:10.388
Yeah.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.923
A few times.

18:11.925 --> 18:15.693
Inside the right bottom
desk drawer is a ledger.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.229
Copy the last two pages.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.931
It'll be locked;
you will need a key

18:19.933 --> 18:21.199
Off of his key ring.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.934
(scoffs)
how do I get that?

18:22.936 --> 18:24.202
Behind you is a vial.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.204
Give it to him.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.939
He'll sleep like the dead

18:27.941 --> 18:30.241
For two hours.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.909
It won't kill him, will it?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.377
(groans)

18:33.379 --> 18:34.545
(chuckles)

18:34.547 --> 18:36.447
Liza,

18:36.449 --> 18:40.251
You haven't caught feelings
for the old man, have you?

18:40.253 --> 18:42.920
Not at all.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.156
No, it won't kill him.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.558
Killing him now
would only create chaos.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.061
I need to siphon his strength.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.230
So when the time is right,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.132
Taking over his organization

18:54.134 --> 18:56.667
Will be like slipping
on a glove.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.936
What if one of his men

18:58.938 --> 19:00.938
Catches me snooping?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.740
Then you're probably dead.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.511
You leave first.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.887
(indistinct chatter)

19:19.925 --> 19:21.759
Man:
Right, right, right.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.595
(overlapping chatter)

19:24.597 --> 19:25.763
I'm under a lot of pressure.

19:29.301 --> 19:32.203
(overlapping chatter continues)

19:32.205 --> 19:34.338
Something tells me we came
to the right place.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.340
You think?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.409
Mr. Sionis will see you now.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.954
Oh.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.489
Richard sionis.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.124
James gordon.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.725
This is my partner,
harvey bullock.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.194
How can I help you detectives?

19:56.196 --> 19:58.196
I don't have much time.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.330
You know this man?

19:59.332 --> 20:00.498
Coleman lawson?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.633
He might have interviewed
for a job.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.135
Sorry, no.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.904
Any of your employees
miss work yesterday?

20:06.906 --> 20:09.907
Any of them show up today
with an injured right hand?

20:09.909 --> 20:12.743
I don't take roll call,
detective.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.012
You mind if we check?

20:15.014 --> 20:17.415
Perhaps you can tell me
what this is about?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.050
Coleman lawson was killed
two night ago.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.652
The man who did it had
your firm's card in his pocket.

20:21.654 --> 20:25.356
Well, there's a thousand ways
he could've gotten that.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.725
What's with all
the warrior baloney?

20:27.727 --> 20:30.428
It inspires me.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.364
High finance is tough business.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.833
In order to succeed,
you have to be a warrior.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.602
No, you don't.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.737
You have to be
a good businessman.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.405
Warriors fight wars.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.840
It's different.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.108
So you fancy yourself

20:44.110 --> 20:45.543
A killer?

20:45.545 --> 20:48.212
Have you killed people,
mr. Sionis?

20:48.214 --> 20:50.248
Only metaphorically.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.183
So all this is just
juvenile play acting.

20:52.185 --> 20:53.351
Exactly.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.019
Thus speaks a man

20:55.021 --> 20:56.387
Who's seen actual combat.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.189
You've killed people
for real,

20:58.191 --> 20:59.191
Haven't you?

20:59.192 --> 21:01.292
True killers are easy to spot.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.861
Yes, they are.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.731
Why all the masks?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.699
A shrink would say
you're hiding something.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.201
To the contrary.

21:10.203 --> 21:12.470
A mask hides the face,

21:12.472 --> 21:14.538
But frees the soul.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.374
A mask

21:16.376 --> 21:18.075
Speaks the truth.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.543
Deep.

21:19.545 --> 21:21.212
How come so many
of your employees

21:21.214 --> 21:22.546
Have scars
and injuries?

21:22.548 --> 21:24.982
Our touch football games
get very rough.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.617
You're a liar, mr. Sionis.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.620
Such fire.

21:31.423 --> 21:32.890
You must miss the battlefield

21:32.892 --> 21:34.392
Desperately.

21:34.394 --> 21:37.528
I imagine killing gets
quite addictive.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.998
You murdered coleman lawson,
didn't you?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.733
Prove it.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.568
We will.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.776
I'd give you a good cop routine,

21:51.778 --> 21:53.978
But it's not in my tool kit.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.983
(indistinct chatter)

22:21.873 --> 22:23.507
(water running)

22:23.509 --> 22:26.210
Gcpd.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.245
(turns off water)
turn around slowly.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.117
Let me see those hands!

22:33.119 --> 22:35.920
(toilet flushes)

22:38.957 --> 22:40.458
Don't move!

22:40.460 --> 22:42.526
(both grunting)

22:48.467 --> 22:50.701
You should've waited for me.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.803
(door closes)

22:52.805 --> 22:55.473
(school bell ringing)

22:55.475 --> 22:57.541
(indistinct chatter)

23:02.247 --> 23:04.048
Hey, brucey.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.050
It's bruce.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.585
No "y."

23:07.587 --> 23:09.887
No parents, either, so I
can call you what I like.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.922
Please, get out of my way.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.158
Snobby little
jerk, isn't he?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.426
For an orphan.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.995
You're being very unkind.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.897
I don't understand why.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.999
Boy, you're a weirdo.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.001
Your mother must...

23:23.002 --> 23:25.102
(grunts)

23:25.104 --> 23:27.438
Don't talk about my mother.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.276
Oh, really?

23:42.854 --> 23:44.922
Oh, is that timothy?

23:50.095 --> 23:53.397
(chuckles)
we met at fish mooney's, hmm?

23:53.399 --> 23:56.567
I'm the fellow who used
to have your job.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.936
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.971
I don't know any...
(shushes)

24:02.707 --> 24:05.576
They'll be time for that.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.411
First things first.

24:07.413 --> 24:09.280
(grunting)

24:09.282 --> 24:11.348
(blows landing,
timothy grunting)

24:17.722 --> 24:18.889
Bullock:
Most killers leave their prints

24:18.891 --> 24:20.891
At the crime scene,
but not you, no.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.594
You left your whole thumb
in the dead guy's mouth.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.563
You got style!
I like you, kid.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.264
This is your last chance.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.767
Once we walk out that door...

24:29.769 --> 24:30.901
It's over.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.403
It was self-defense.

24:32.405 --> 24:33.637
Bullock:
Of course it was.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.072
Wasn't that what I said, jim?

24:35.074 --> 24:37.308
Didn't I say it was
probably self-defense?

24:38.610 --> 24:41.145
Talk.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.780
Bullock:
Gordon's getting
the rest of his statement.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.482
Apparently it was
part of the hiring process.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.318
Sionis told the top three
candidates to fight it out.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.953
They weren't supposed
to fight to the death, but...

24:48.955 --> 24:50.688
This is unbelievable.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.156
They all signed
confidentiality agreements,

24:52.158 --> 24:54.124
So they're accomplices
to whatever happens.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.292
Do we know where
the fight was held?

24:55.294 --> 24:56.327
Some old office building.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.828
The windows were boarded up.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.630
And he was taken there
blindfolded.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.298
Yes, ed?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.133
Printer toner.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.135
Do you know what
he's talking about?

25:05.137 --> 25:07.137
The medical examiner's report
said it was black ink.

25:07.139 --> 25:10.007
But I did my own examination,
and it was printer toner.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.942
Also, I pulled staples
from his shoulders.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.311
And found graphite chips
between his ribs.

25:14.313 --> 25:15.846
Your man was killed
in an office.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.915
Yeah, we're kind of past that,
ed, but thanks.

25:19.050 --> 25:21.318
Is there something else?
Yes.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.153
It made me think of a case
from a year ago.

25:23.155 --> 25:24.455
Young man, business suit,

25:24.457 --> 25:26.457
Esophagus lacerated
from index card

25:26.459 --> 25:28.392
Shoved down his throat.
So, I did some digging...

25:28.394 --> 25:31.128
How many other bodies were
killed with office supplies?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.898
Four... In the last three years.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.332
Essen:
Get that man

25:35.334 --> 25:36.800
To sign a confession. Now.

25:36.802 --> 25:39.970
I think we have a problem.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.139
I explained to detective gordon,
as counsel to mr. Adams

25:42.141 --> 25:43.674
I'd advised him
against speaking further.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.808
Also, any statements

25:44.810 --> 25:46.143
He has made will be
considered having

25:46.145 --> 25:47.478
Been made under duress.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.147
Uh-huh, and how much is sionis
paying him to take the fall?

25:50.149 --> 25:51.715
Good day.

25:53.151 --> 25:55.753
He showed up before adams
could sign his statements.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.489
We got to figure out where
sionis is staging these fights.

25:58.491 --> 26:01.158
I'll run all the buildings he
or his company owns in gotham.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.160
This make any sense to you?

26:03.162 --> 26:05.930
No, but how's it any worse
than the goat or the balloonman?

26:05.932 --> 26:08.265
When did this become
normal for this city?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.500
What changed?

26:09.502 --> 26:10.601
Maybe nothing.
Maybe it was always

26:10.603 --> 26:12.836
Just below the surface.
Only needed a spark.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.672
Like thomas and martha
wayne being killed?

26:15.941 --> 26:17.675
I'm not blind, gordon.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.376
I know you're
still looking into it.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.513
But how could their deaths
have caused all this?

26:22.515 --> 26:24.848
Why were they so important?

26:24.850 --> 26:26.884
I think it's
what they represented.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.353
A different gotham.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.854
Decent, hopeful.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.091
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

26:35.627 --> 26:37.695
When zsasz came for you,
I should've stayed.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.129
I told you to go.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.432
That doesn't matter.
I should've stayed.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.368
Now, let's get this guy.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.437
Yeah.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.676
(door opens)

26:54.312 --> 26:56.046
Tad late, master bruce.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.548
Oi.

26:57.550 --> 26:59.116
Oi. What happened to you?
I'm perfectly fine!

26:59.118 --> 27:00.451
What happened?

27:03.321 --> 27:06.490
Someone spoke disrespectfully
about my mother.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.093
Oh, did they now?

27:09.095 --> 27:11.762
Well, I hope you broke
their bastard teeth for them.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.098
No.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.833
He's much bigger
than me, and I...

27:15.835 --> 27:17.668
I'm not very good at fighting.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.003
Didn't hurt him at all.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.538
Not at all?

27:22.907 --> 27:24.975
Don't tell the school.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.113
Not bloody likely.

27:29.115 --> 27:31.849
Bullock:
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

27:31.851 --> 27:33.250
Sionis owns half of gotham!

27:33.252 --> 27:34.418
All right, we'll split up.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.020
Focus on the buildings
that are abandoned

27:36.022 --> 27:37.321
Or under construction first.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.589
This son of a bitch
is not getting away!

27:38.591 --> 27:40.658
I'll say one thing...
he has your number.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.760
What are you talking about?
Sionis.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.595
You may not have put down
cobblepot, jimmy boy,

27:44.597 --> 27:46.497
But you got a demon in you.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.432
You can call yourself a soldier,
but all this fighting falcone,

27:48.434 --> 27:50.868
Fighting other cops,

27:50.870 --> 27:52.503
You love it.
So, when you find something

27:52.505 --> 27:55.706
That seems remotely possible,
call me.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.775
(cell phone ringing)

28:00.145 --> 28:02.212
Barbara, everything all right?

28:02.214 --> 28:04.148
Fine. I just, uh,

28:04.150 --> 28:06.116
I wanted to check in.

28:06.118 --> 28:08.385
Can we talk later? I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.486
Of course.
(laughs)

28:09.488 --> 28:11.455
I love...
(clicks, dial tone droning)

28:13.658 --> 28:15.726
(phone beeps off)

28:20.699 --> 28:23.634
Man:
Hey!

28:23.636 --> 28:25.636
Boss wants his tea.

28:25.638 --> 28:27.871
It's almost ready.

28:54.165 --> 28:56.233
(lights buzzing)

29:00.004 --> 29:02.673
(rattling nearby)

29:06.344 --> 29:08.178
Gcpd!

29:08.180 --> 29:10.614
(gasps)

29:12.584 --> 29:14.184
Anybody else here?

29:15.053 --> 29:16.386
(taser clicking)
(grunts)

29:16.388 --> 29:18.388
That...

29:18.390 --> 29:20.424
Would be a yes.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.930
All right, cream and sugar.
Yeah.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.103
Hey.

29:35.573 --> 29:37.141
Uh...

29:37.143 --> 29:39.710
Hi.

29:39.712 --> 29:41.879
A girl's got to shop.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.624
(siren wailing in distance)

29:59.397 --> 30:00.564
This...

30:00.566 --> 30:03.100
Is your father's watch.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.169
Don't you lose it now.

30:07.238 --> 30:10.073
Tommy elliot's house.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.411
Don't you be scared.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.914
I'm not.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.316
I'm visualizing
what I'm gonna do.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.751
'cause you if you don't want
to do this,

30:20.753 --> 30:22.119
There's no shame in it.

30:22.121 --> 30:25.055
There would be
immense shame in it.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.366
(buzzer rings)

30:41.439 --> 30:42.773
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:42.775 --> 30:44.474
We have unfinished business.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.043
Listen, if you think
you're gonna tell my parents...

30:46.045 --> 30:48.178
(grunts)
are you crazy?!

30:48.180 --> 30:51.114
Don't talk about my mother!

30:51.116 --> 30:53.116
Alfred:
Master bruce!

30:58.389 --> 31:00.824
Point well made, I think.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.025
You all right, mate?

31:02.027 --> 31:03.627
Any broken bones?

31:03.629 --> 31:05.162
He-he tried to kill me!

31:05.164 --> 31:06.230
That's right.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.865
He did.

31:07.867 --> 31:08.966
He tried to kill you.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.703
Just you remember that
next time you see him.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.538
And you remember

31:14.540 --> 31:16.974
That I let him try.

31:18.142 --> 31:19.810
Now, let's get some ice

31:19.812 --> 31:21.278
On those knuckles.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.715
What do you fancy
for your dinner?

31:24.717 --> 31:26.083
Pizza.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.150
Pizza?

31:27.152 --> 31:30.387
Superb choice,
master bruce.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.822
Jim, where the hell are you?

31:31.824 --> 31:34.925
My list crapped out. Call me.

31:34.927 --> 31:37.160
Nygma, gordon hasn't
called in, has he?

31:37.162 --> 31:41.064
No. But if the detective
becomes the mystery...

31:43.534 --> 31:46.536
Sionis (over loudspeaker):
Wake up.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.672
Detective gordon?

31:48.674 --> 31:50.474
Wake up!

31:51.776 --> 31:53.710
So, three of you

31:53.712 --> 31:57.180
Applied for a position
at my firm.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.883
I explained then

31:59.885 --> 32:02.519
You can use anything here
as a weapon

32:02.521 --> 32:05.022
And the last man standing
gets the job.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.390
However...

32:06.392 --> 32:08.525
Tonight is special.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.360
You see the man

32:10.362 --> 32:12.362
Without the mask?

32:12.364 --> 32:15.365
Whoever kills him...
Is the victor.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.700
Listen to me.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.535
I'm a cop.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.238
So far, none of you
have broken any laws.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.873
Let the games...

32:22.875 --> 32:24.942
Begin.
(bell rings)

32:25.877 --> 32:27.210
One last chance!

32:27.212 --> 32:29.713
Nobody move!
Sionis:
Oh.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.115
And I'll throw in a
million-dollar signing bonus.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.485
Ah, crap.

32:41.626 --> 32:42.893
Alvarez.

32:42.895 --> 32:44.394
I need help checking
these addresses.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.562
Gordon might be
in trouble.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.830
Busy.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.565
I'm gonna remember that
next time your wife calls,

32:48.567 --> 32:50.634
Asking where you are,
you putz.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.073
Collins.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.141
Listen up, man,
can I have some help?

33:02.080 --> 33:04.648
Now, listen up,
you sons of bitches!

33:06.617 --> 33:08.518
So, you don't like gordon!

33:08.520 --> 33:09.586
Fine.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.588
He can be a total asshat.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.924
But he is still a cop.

33:13.926 --> 33:16.994
And not one of you, not one,
stood up when he needed it.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.595
That ain't happening twice.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.932
I need help checking
these addresses.

33:21.934 --> 33:23.166
Now.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.837
Give me a couple.

33:34.479 --> 33:36.513
Okay.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.782
But you cover
with my wife, right?

33:38.784 --> 33:40.417
Yeah.

33:43.888 --> 33:46.423
(grunting)

33:49.727 --> 33:51.028
(cheering)

33:58.803 --> 34:00.103
(gasping)

34:06.310 --> 34:07.310
(exclaiming)

34:09.414 --> 34:11.380
(grunting)

34:16.821 --> 34:19.089
(murmuring)
it's over.

34:19.091 --> 34:21.158
(sword unsheathing)

34:25.396 --> 34:27.164
I knew you had a killer in you.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.132
(murmuring)

34:30.101 --> 34:31.768
So...

34:31.770 --> 34:33.770
Where are your brother police?

34:33.772 --> 34:35.605
Did they abandon you?

34:35.607 --> 34:37.741
I don't need them.

34:48.853 --> 34:49.920
(cheering)

34:54.358 --> 34:57.160
Seems I'll have to give myself
the million dollars.

35:24.889 --> 35:27.491
(sword clatters on floor)

35:27.493 --> 35:28.992
Essen:
Jim?

35:28.994 --> 35:30.560
(footsteps approaching)
jim?!

35:33.631 --> 35:34.998
Jim!

35:38.169 --> 35:40.003
(groans)

35:49.013 --> 35:51.014
Thanks.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.550
You're welcome.

You'd better have a good
reason for being here.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.975
Did you get what I asked for?

36:51.977 --> 36:54.911
I want out.

36:56.180 --> 36:58.248
No.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.417
He's gonna find out.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.420
Maybe not today,
but soon.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.988
Is it worth it?

37:04.990 --> 37:08.491
You are rich.

37:08.493 --> 37:10.493
People are afraid of you.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.862
Is that not enough?

37:12.864 --> 37:15.198
No.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.435
It's not.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.570
I grew up not too
far from here.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.206
One bedroom,
cold water.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.874
Just me and my mama.

37:24.876 --> 37:27.177
I used to sleep in a
bed behind a curtain.

37:27.179 --> 37:30.680
It's where I would hide
when she entertained men.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.851
And that's where I was
when he killed her.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.920
One of falcone's men.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.056
Didn't like the service.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.891
I hid there,

37:41.893 --> 37:45.862
Silent, until morning.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.865
With my mama two
feet away from me.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.067
That night, I made a promise.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.370
To get revenge.

37:53.372 --> 37:56.873
To never again be powerless.

37:56.875 --> 38:02.245
To never let any man,
<i>any</i> man, be over me.

38:02.247 --> 38:05.815
This is about keeping that
promise to that little girl.

38:09.587 --> 38:11.554
So, what's this about?

38:12.590 --> 38:14.991
(chuckles under her breath)

38:14.993 --> 38:16.559
This is a thread.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.964
I pull this
and falcone comes undone.

38:30.908 --> 38:32.809
You're scared.

38:32.811 --> 38:36.813
But I won't let
anything happen to you,

38:36.815 --> 38:38.448
And that's a promise.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.151
I want you to say...

38:41.153 --> 38:43.320
"I believe you, mama."

38:43.322 --> 38:46.856
I believe you, mama.

38:48.459 --> 38:50.527
That's my girl.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.834
Oswald: The thing is,
when I had your job,

38:57.836 --> 39:00.603
Had someone asked me,
"what is miss mooney's secret?"

39:00.605 --> 39:02.906
I could've answered.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.042
Ooh.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.911
(chuckles)

39:09.847 --> 39:11.481
Timothy...

39:11.483 --> 39:14.351
I think you're
holding back on me.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.886
Okay, I...

39:16.888 --> 39:18.521
I might've heard her
with butch.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.457
Talking about what?
Whom?

39:20.459 --> 39:23.059
Fal... Falcone.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.828
She said, "our...

39:24.830 --> 39:26.830
Our friend with falcone."

39:26.832 --> 39:28.231
That's it.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.500
She was whispering.
Please.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.869
She has someone
close to falcone.

39:34.004 --> 39:36.072
Of course.

39:39.343 --> 39:41.211
Thank you.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.315
No one can find the body.

39:45.317 --> 39:46.317
No.

39:46.318 --> 39:48.218
We are at peace after all.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.353
No! No, please!

39:50.355 --> 39:52.489
No! No...!

39:52.491 --> 39:54.991
(distant siren wailing)

39:54.993 --> 39:56.559
(low chatter)

39:58.028 --> 40:00.497
Bullock: Alvarez and collins
are bringing in sionis' minions.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.999
Pansies tried to rabbit when
they saw you cuffing their boss.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.067
You okay?

40:06.036 --> 40:07.771
Essen told me you made a speech.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.506
I wouldn't call it a speech.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.374
Said you called me an asshat.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.510
I did call you that.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.246
Thank you.

40:16.248 --> 40:18.248
For having my back.

40:18.250 --> 40:21.351
Now and before.

40:21.353 --> 40:23.620
Just try not to be such
a pain in the neck.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.321
Makes my day harder.

40:26.390 --> 40:28.458
You know, you were wrong.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.560
What you said earlier.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.029
It's not that I love fighting.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.232
But I'm not afraid to, either.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.668
And if we don't fight
for this city, who will?

40:40.738 --> 40:44.073
I'm not gonna stop, harvey.

40:44.075 --> 40:47.811
Falcone, the mayor, every cop
I know that's dirty,

40:47.813 --> 40:49.179
I'm gonna get them.

40:51.549 --> 40:54.551
You should know that.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.619
Go home, jim.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.998
You were listening
tonight, weren't you?

41:09.000 --> 41:12.068
You gonna get in
trouble, old woman.

41:12.070 --> 41:15.505
Heard you telling
that girl stories.

41:15.507 --> 41:20.577
A lie with a heart of truth
is a powerful thing.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.645
Go on, it's late.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.892
(phone rings)

41:48.305 --> 41:50.306
(answering machine beeps)

41:50.308 --> 41:51.374
Hey, it's me.

41:51.376 --> 41:53.676
I'm coming home soon.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.945
Everything is gonna be better,
I promise.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.947
I love you.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.449
Hey, gordon.

41:59.451 --> 42:00.550
Got a minute?

42:00.552 --> 42:01.552
Can it wait?

42:01.553 --> 42:03.186
Kind of on my way
out of here.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.121
Some unis brought in a perp.

42:05.123 --> 42:06.289
Claims to know you.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.957
Oh, yeah?
What's the charge?

42:07.959 --> 42:09.959
B and e, some
fancy store uptown.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.528
Pretty
professional job.

42:11.530 --> 42:12.795
Kid didn't even
trip the alarm.

42:12.797 --> 42:14.797
Kid?

42:14.799 --> 42:16.199
Boy or girl?

42:16.201 --> 42:17.467
Girl.

42:17.469 --> 42:19.702
Said to ask if you been down
any sewers lately.

42:25.009 --> 42:28.011
Hey, detective.

42:28.013 --> 42:30.213
Miss me?

42:37.655 --> 42:40.490
I enjoyed it.

42:40.492 --> 42:42.592
I enjoyed hurting him.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.661
Of course you did.

42:48.165 --> 42:50.667
He deserved it.

42:50.669 --> 42:53.736
I'm so angry all the time.

42:55.673 --> 42:57.173
Will that ever go away?

42:57.175 --> 43:00.276
That I don't know.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.313
Alfred...

43:05.583 --> 43:08.017
...Can you teach me
how to fight?

43:11.855 --> 43:16.859
Yes, master bruce.

43:16.861 --> 43:19.929
Yes, I can.
