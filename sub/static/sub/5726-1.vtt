WEBVTT

02:05.951 --> 02:06.786
<i>All right, team,</i>

02:06.986 --> 02:07.987
<i>stay in sight of each other.</i>

02:08.187 --> 02:09.923
<i>Let's make NASA proud today.</i>

02:10.854 --> 02:12.357
<i>How's it looking
over there, Watney?</i>

02:12.557 --> 02:13.860
<i>Well, you'll
be happy to hear...</i>

02:14.060 --> 02:16.795
<i>that in Grid Section 14-28,</i>

02:16.995 --> 02:19.731
<i>the particles were
predominantly coarse...</i>

02:19.931 --> 02:23.101
but in 29, they're much finer...

02:23.301 --> 02:25.203
and they should be ideal for chem analysis.

02:25.403 --> 02:26.571
<i>Oh, wow. Did
everybody hear that?</i>

02:26.771 --> 02:28.506
<i>Mark just discovered dirt.</i>

02:28.706 --> 02:29.775
<i>Should we alert the media?</i>

02:29.975 --> 02:31.743
<i>Sorry, what are
you doing today, Martinez?</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:33.644
Making sure the MAV is still upright?

02:33.844 --> 02:34.880
<i>I'd like you to know</i>

02:35.080 --> 02:35.947
<i>that visual inspection
of the equipment...</i>

02:36.147 --> 02:37.648
<i>is imperative to mission success.</i>

02:37.848 --> 02:40.553
<i>I also would like to report
that the MAV is still upright.</i>

02:40.753 --> 02:41.921
<i>Watney,</i>

02:42.121 --> 02:43.154
<i>you keep leaving your channel open...</i>

02:43.354 --> 02:45.124
<i>which leads to Martinez responding...</i>

02:45.324 --> 02:46.492
<i>which leads to all of us listening...</i>

02:46.692 --> 02:48.126
<i>which leads to me being annoyed.</i>

02:48.326 --> 02:49.528
<i>Roger that.</i>

02:49.728 --> 02:50.762
<i>Martinez, the captain
would like you to please...</i>

02:50.962 --> 02:52.164
shut your smart mouth.

02:53.932 --> 02:55.301
We'd prefer to use a different adjective

02:55.501 --> 02:57.337
to describe Martinez's mouth.

02:57.537 --> 02:58.803
<i>Did Beck just insult me?</i>

02:59.003 --> 03:01.172
<i>"Dr. Beck." And yes.</i>

03:01.372 --> 03:03.576
Happy to turn the radios
off from here, Commander.

03:03.776 --> 03:04.743
Just say the word.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.178
Wait, Johanssen.

03:06.378 --> 03:07.480
Constant communication is the hallmark...

03:07.680 --> 03:08.748
Shut 'em off.

03:08.948 --> 03:09.848
<i>No.</i>

03:10.048 --> 03:11.784
No. Excuse me.

03:12.518 --> 03:14.286
<i>I apologize for
my countrymen, Vogel.</i>

03:14.486 --> 03:15.821
Accepted.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.756
How many samples do we need, Commander?

03:17.956 --> 03:19.357
<i>Seven.</i>

03:19.557 --> 03:21.060
<i>100 grams each.</i>

03:27.199 --> 03:28.968
We have a mission update. A storm warning.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.535
<i>Commander, you should come inside.</i>

03:30.735 --> 03:31.771
<i>You're gonna want to see this.</i>

03:31.971 --> 03:33.005
What is it?

03:33.205 --> 03:34.273
<i>A storm warning.</i>

03:34.473 --> 03:35.774
I saw that in
this morning's briefing.

03:35.974 --> 03:37.844
We'll be inside before it hits.

03:38.044 --> 03:40.813
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.882
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.

03:49.121 --> 03:51.391
<i>Martinez, how does it look?</i>

03:52.157 --> 03:53.760
<i>Not good.</i>

03:56.395 --> 03:59.130
"1,200 kilometers in diameter,
bearing 24.41 degrees."

03:59.330 --> 04:00.332
That's tracking right towards us.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.034
"Based on current escalation,

04:02.234 --> 04:05.102
"estimated force of 8,600 newtons."

04:05.302 --> 04:06.505
What's the abort force?

04:06.705 --> 04:08.908
7,500.

04:09.641 --> 04:11.543
<i>Anything more than
that and the MAV could tip.</i>

04:11.743 --> 04:12.945
Do we scrub?

04:13.145 --> 04:14.981
Begin abort procedure.

04:15.181 --> 04:17.149
We are estimating
with a margin of error.

04:17.349 --> 04:19.116
We could wait it out.

04:19.315 --> 04:21.220
Let's wait it out.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.090
Let's wait it out.

04:25.190 --> 04:27.159
Commander?

04:27.359 --> 04:28.661
Prep emergency departure.

04:28.861 --> 04:30.163
Commander?

04:30.363 --> 04:32.499
We're scrubbed. That's an order.

04:42.842 --> 04:45.077
<i>Martinez, how long before take-off?</i>

04:45.277 --> 04:46.779
12 minutes.

04:49.780 --> 04:51.250
Visibility is almost zero.

04:51.450 --> 04:52.450
Anyone gets lost,

04:52.650 --> 04:53.753
hone in on my suit's telemetry.

04:53.953 --> 04:54.753
You ready?

04:54.953 --> 04:56.856
Ready.

04:59.058 --> 04:59.959
Commander, are you okay?

05:00.159 --> 05:02.027
I'm okay.

05:26.018 --> 05:27.185
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,

05:27.385 --> 05:29.488
and the MAV is gonna tip at 12.3.

05:29.688 --> 05:31.957
Hey! We might be able
to keep the MAV from tipping.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.893
How?

05:34.359 --> 05:37.094
Use the cables from the
comms mast as guy-lines...

05:37.294 --> 05:39.031
anchor it with the Rover's.

05:39.231 --> 05:40.666
Watch out!

05:43.534 --> 05:45.037
Watney!

05:46.505 --> 05:48.573
<i>Warning.
Suit breach detected.</i>

05:48.773 --> 05:49.541
What happened?

05:49.741 --> 05:50.709
He was hit.

05:50.909 --> 05:52.344
Watney, report.

05:52.878 --> 05:53.779
Before we lost telemetry,

05:53.979 --> 05:54.981
his decompression alarm went off.

05:55.181 --> 05:55.981
Where did you last see him?

05:56.181 --> 05:57.281
I don't know where he is.

05:57.481 --> 05:58.082
What are the vitals on his suit?

05:58.282 --> 05:59.383
He's offline.

05:59.583 --> 06:00.885
A complete loss of signal on Watney.

06:01.085 --> 06:02.221
- Beck!
- Yeah.

06:02.421 --> 06:04.656
How long can he survive decompression?

06:04.856 --> 06:06.224
Less than a minute.

06:06.424 --> 06:08.726
Line up, walk west.

06:08.926 --> 06:11.230
He may be prone. We
don't wanna step over him.

06:12.530 --> 06:13.832
Commander...

06:14.032 --> 06:15.733
We're at 10.5 degrees.

06:15.933 --> 06:16.969
<i>Warning. Excessive tilt.</i>

06:17.169 --> 06:19.805
Tilting to 11 with all the gusts of wind.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.406
Copy that.

06:21.606 --> 06:24.109
Everyone, hone in on Martinez's suit.

06:24.309 --> 06:26.245
It'll get you to airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.

06:26.445 --> 06:27.846
What about you, Commander?

06:28.046 --> 06:30.582
I'm gonna search a
little longer. Get moving!

06:30.782 --> 06:32.318
Go!

06:35.621 --> 06:37.022
Watney!

06:37.222 --> 06:39.091
Watney, report!

06:39.291 --> 06:41.659
<i>The MAV's at 11.6 degrees.</i>

06:41.859 --> 06:43.094
One good gust and we're tipping.

06:43.294 --> 06:44.596
If it tips, you launch.

06:44.796 --> 06:46.265
You really think I'm
gonna leave you behind?

06:46.465 --> 06:48.332
<i>That's an order, Martinez.</i>

06:48.532 --> 06:50.368
Mark!

06:50.568 --> 06:54.172
Mark! Can you hear me?

06:55.474 --> 06:58.142
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?

06:58.342 --> 07:00.012
Could that detect Watney's suit?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.479
It's made to see
the <i>Hermes</i> from orbit...

07:01.679 --> 07:03.315
not a little piece of
metal from a single suit.

07:03.515 --> 07:04.483
<i>Give it a try.</i>

07:04.683 --> 07:05.784
Roger.

07:05.984 --> 07:06.986
What is she thinking? She knows

07:07.186 --> 07:08.219
the infrared can't get through a sandstorm.

07:08.419 --> 07:10.522
She's grasping for anything.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.390
<i>We've got negative contact</i>

07:11.590 --> 07:12.657
<i>on the proximity radar.</i>

07:12.857 --> 07:13.959
Nothing?

07:14.159 --> 07:16.395
<i>No. I can barely see the Hab.</i>

07:17.395 --> 07:19.097
Commander, I know you don't
wanna hear this, but...

07:19.297 --> 07:20.999
Mark is dead.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.502
<i>Commander!</i>

07:23.702 --> 07:25.971
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?

07:26.171 --> 07:27.205
My friend just died.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.573
I don't want my commander to die, too.

07:28.773 --> 07:29.842
<i>Stability warning.</i>

07:30.042 --> 07:31.409
We're tipping!

07:31.609 --> 07:34.346
<i>Commander, you need to
get back to the ship, now!</i>

07:34.546 --> 07:36.115
13 degrees.

07:36.715 --> 07:38.250
If we pass balance, we'll never rock back.

07:38.450 --> 07:39.484
I've got one more trick left,

07:39.684 --> 07:41.525
and then I'm following orders, Commander.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.822
You're firing the OMS?

07:45.022 --> 07:46.426
That's right.

07:50.029 --> 07:51.630
Commander!

07:51.830 --> 07:53.511
On my way.

07:56.433 --> 07:57.736
<i>Johanssen, let's go.</i>

08:05.143 --> 08:07.579
Mark!

08:19.491 --> 08:21.260
<i>We're at 11.5 and holding.</i>

08:24.563 --> 08:26.065
<i>Ready to go on your command.</i>

08:28.000 --> 08:29.502
Ready to launch.

08:30.268 --> 08:31.870
Commander.

08:32.070 --> 08:33.605
I need you to verbally
tell me whether or not to.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.308
Launch.

09:16.614 --> 09:18.015
<i>At around 4:30 a.m.</i>

09:18.215 --> 09:19.583
<i>Central Standard Time...</i>

09:19.783 --> 09:21.886
<i>our satellites detected a storm</i>

09:22.086 --> 09:24.923
<i>approaching the</i> Ares
3 <i> mission site on Mars.</i>

09:25.123 --> 09:28.693
<i>At 6:45, the storm had
escalated to severe...</i>

09:28.893 --> 09:31.764
<i>and we had no choice but
to abort the mission.</i>

09:31.964 --> 09:34.165
<i>Thanks to the quick action
of Commander Lewis...</i>

09:34.365 --> 09:37.635
<i>astronauts Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel...</i>

09:37.835 --> 09:40.539
<i>were all able to reach
the Mars Ascent Vehicle...</i>

09:40.739 --> 09:44.277
<i>and perform an emergency
launch at 7:28 Central Time.</i>

09:45.509 --> 09:47.779
Unfortunately, during the evacuation...

09:47.979 --> 09:51.849
astronaut Mark Watney was
struck by debris and killed.

09:53.118 --> 09:54.953
Commander Lewis and the rest of her team...

09:55.153 --> 09:57.389
were able to intercept
safely with the <i>Hermes</i>

09:57.589 --> 09:59.524
and are now heading home.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.394
But Mark Watney is dead.

10:02.594 --> 10:03.595
Director Sanders!

10:38.128 --> 10:40.765
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

10:47.071 --> 10:49.474
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

10:55.947 --> 10:57.583
<i>Oxygen level...</i>

12:15.793 --> 12:18.330
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

15:17.542 --> 15:19.478
Fuck.

15:48.473 --> 15:49.573
Okay.

15:49.773 --> 15:51.509
<i>Okay.</i>

15:53.177 --> 15:57.549
<i>Hello, this is Mark Watney, astronaut.</i>

15:57.983 --> 16:00.918
<i>I'm entering this log for the record...</i>

16:01.118 --> 16:03.922
<i>in case I don't make it.</i>

16:06.123 --> 16:10.227
<i>It is 06:53 on Sol 19...</i>

16:10.427 --> 16:13.698
<i>and I'm alive.</i>

16:14.566 --> 16:15.933
<i>Obviously.</i>

16:16.133 --> 16:18.470
<i>But I'm guessing that's
gonna come as a surprise</i>

16:18.670 --> 16:21.939
<i>to my crewmates and to NASA.</i>

16:22.139 --> 16:25.076
<i>And to the entire world, really, so...</i>

16:27.644 --> 16:29.681
<i>Surprise.</i>

16:30.647 --> 16:32.818
<i>I did not die on Sol 18.</i>

16:33.018 --> 16:34.952
<i>Best I can figure...</i>

16:35.152 --> 16:37.188
<i>this length of our primary
communications antenna</i>

16:37.388 --> 16:38.655
<i>broke off...</i>

16:38.855 --> 16:40.891
<i>and tore through my bio-monitor...</i>

16:41.091 --> 16:43.828
<i>and ripped a hole in me as well.</i>

16:44.362 --> 16:47.265
<i>But the antenna and the blood, really,</i>

16:47.465 --> 16:49.467
<i>managed to seal the
breach in my suit...</i>

16:49.667 --> 16:51.169
<i>which kept me alive,</i>

16:51.369 --> 16:53.972
<i>even though the crew must
have thought I was dead.</i>

16:54.538 --> 16:57.042
<i>I have no way to contact NASA.</i>

16:57.242 --> 17:00.010
<i>And even if I could, it's
gonna be four years...</i>

17:00.210 --> 17:02.847
<i>until a manned mission can reach me.</i>

17:03.513 --> 17:05.884
<i>And I'm in a Hab
designed to last 31 days.</i>

17:06.084 --> 17:08.286
<i>If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm gonna suffocate.</i>

17:08.486 --> 17:10.922
<i>If the water reclaimer
breaks, I'll die of thirst.</i>

17:11.122 --> 17:13.124
<i>If the Hab breaches, I'm
just gonna, kind of...</i>

17:13.324 --> 17:14.858
<i>implode.</i>

17:15.693 --> 17:18.796
<i>And if by some miracle,
none of that happens...</i>

17:19.263 --> 17:21.700
<i>eventually I'm gonna run out of food.</i>

17:22.732 --> 17:24.301
<i>So...</i>

17:25.268 --> 17:26.738
<i>yeah.</i>

17:30.408 --> 17:31.944
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:20.652 --> 19:23.254
I'm not gonna die here.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.430
32...

20:05.028 --> 20:06.965
33...

20:08.498 --> 20:10.269
34...

20:10.867 --> 20:12.737
35, 36.

20:12.937 --> 20:15.806
Sweet and sour chicken.

20:47.905 --> 20:49.907
What do we got?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.549
<i>Right, let's do the math.</i>

20:58.749 --> 21:02.287
<i>Our surface mission here was
supposed to last 31 sols.</i>

21:02.487 --> 21:03.921
<i>For redundancy, they sent
68 sols worth of food.</i>

21:04.121 --> 21:05.456
<i>That's for 6 people.</i>

21:05.656 --> 21:08.326
<i>So for just me, that's
gonna last 300 sols...</i>

21:08.526 --> 21:11.462
<i>which I figure I can
stretch to 400 if I ration.</i>

21:11.662 --> 21:14.633
<i>So I got to figure out a way to grow</i>

21:14.833 --> 21:16.969
<i>three years' worth of food here.</i>

21:17.468 --> 21:20.038
<i>On a planet where nothing grows.</i>

21:20.238 --> 21:21.840
<i>Luckily...</i>

21:24.075 --> 21:25.511
<i>I'm a botanist.</i>

21:29.447 --> 21:34.386
<i>Mars will come to
fear my botany powers.</i>

22:19.096 --> 22:21.132
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

22:31.041 --> 22:33.177
<i>Staple came out.</i>

23:22.527 --> 23:24.596
Fuck you, Mars.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.379

24:43.173 --> 24:45.710
<i>The problem is water.</i>

24:45.910 --> 24:51.081
I have created 126 square meters of soil.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.216
<i>But every cubic meter of soil requires</i>

24:53.416 --> 24:56.319
<i>40 liters of water to be farmable.</i>

24:56.519 --> 24:59.992
<i>So I gotta make a lot more water.</i>

25:00.557 --> 25:02.993
<i>Good thing is, I know the recipe.</i>

25:03.193 --> 25:05.362
You take hydrogen, you
add oxygen, you burn.

25:05.562 --> 25:08.298
<i>Now, I have hundreds of liters</i>

25:08.498 --> 25:11.403
<i>of unused hydrazine at the MDV.</i>

25:11.603 --> 25:14.104
<i>If I run the hydrazine
over an iridium catalyst,</i>

25:14.304 --> 25:16.973
<i>it'll separate into N2 and H2.</i>

25:17.173 --> 25:21.144
<i>And then if I just direct the
hydrogen into a small area...</i>

25:21.344 --> 25:23.513
<i>and burn it.</i>

25:23.713 --> 25:26.584
<i>Luckily, in the history of humanity...</i>

25:26.784 --> 25:28.452
nothing bad has ever happened

25:28.652 --> 25:31.856
from lighting hydrogen on fire.

25:32.056 --> 25:33.824
<i>NASA hates fire.</i>

25:34.024 --> 25:35.093
<i>Because of the whole</i>

25:35.293 --> 25:38.362
<i>"fire makes everybody
die in space" thing.</i>

25:38.562 --> 25:40.164
<i>So, everything they
sent us up here with</i>

25:40.364 --> 25:41.798
<i>is flame-retardant...</i>

25:41.998 --> 25:45.469
with the notable exception of...

25:46.269 --> 25:48.572
Martinez's personal items.

25:49.106 --> 25:50.541
I am sorry, Martinez.

25:50.741 --> 25:52.009
But if you didn't want me
to go through your stuff...

25:52.209 --> 25:55.446
you shouldn't have left me
for dead on a desolate planet.

25:55.646 --> 25:56.814
By the way, I'm figuring you're gonna be

25:57.014 --> 25:59.384
fine with this, given my present situation.

25:59.584 --> 26:00.384
<i>What's everybody doing?</i>

26:00.584 --> 26:01.318
<i>Taking a holiday from being cool?</i>

26:01.518 --> 26:03.588
Counting on you.

26:23.441 --> 26:25.143
Whoo!

26:36.787 --> 26:40.191
So, yeah, I blew myself up.

26:40.391 --> 26:42.760
Best guess...

26:42.960 --> 26:48.500
I forgot to account
for the excess oxygen...

26:49.267 --> 26:53.136
that I've been exhaling
when I did my calculations.

26:53.336 --> 26:56.108
Because I'm stupid.

26:58.374 --> 27:00.344
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work here...

27:00.544 --> 27:03.682
just as soon as my ears stop ringing.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.185
<i>Interesting side note,</i>

27:09.385 --> 27:12.155
<i>this is actually how the Jet
Propulsion Lab was founded.</i>

27:12.355 --> 27:15.760
<i>Five guys at Caltech were
trying to make rocket fuel...</i>

27:15.960 --> 27:17.194
<i>and they nearly burned down their dorm.</i>

27:17.394 --> 27:18.762
<i>And rather than expel them...</i>

27:18.962 --> 27:21.632
<i>they banished them to a nearby farm,</i>

27:21.832 --> 27:23.734
<i>told them to keep working.</i>

27:24.369 --> 27:26.069
<i>And now we have a space program.</i>

27:29.440 --> 27:31.275
Okay.

28:48.052 --> 28:50.255
Hey, there.

28:59.896 --> 29:01.132
<i>The nation was blessed</i>

29:01.332 --> 29:03.401
<i>to have Mark serving
in our space program.</i>

29:03.601 --> 29:05.903
<i>While his loss will be deeply felt...</i>

29:06.103 --> 29:08.639
<i>the men and women of NASA
will soldier forth...</i>

29:08.839 --> 29:11.408
<i>onward and upward in the
mission of their agency.</i>

29:12.108 --> 29:14.243
<i>By doing so, they honor the legacy</i>

29:14.443 --> 29:16.647
<i>Mark's leaving behind...</i>

29:16.847 --> 29:19.850
<i>and they ensure his sacrifice
will not be in vain.</i>

29:30.928 --> 29:32.230
<i>I have the honor of speaking</i>

29:32.430 --> 29:34.498
<i>not only for the men
and women of NASA...</i>

29:34.698 --> 29:36.267
<i>but for people all over the world...</i>

29:36.467 --> 29:38.868
I thought you gave
a lovely speech, by the way.

29:41.538 --> 29:43.039
I need you to authorize my satellite time.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.843
It's not gonna happen.

29:45.043 --> 29:46.845
We're funded for five <i>Ares</i> missions.

29:47.045 --> 29:49.414
I think I can get Congress
to authorize a sixth.

29:49.614 --> 29:51.715
- No.
- <i>Ares 3</i> evac'd after 18 sols.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.750
There's half a mission
worth of supplies up there.

29:53.950 --> 29:54.818
I can sell it at a fraction

29:55.018 --> 29:56.619
of the cost of a normal mission...

29:56.819 --> 29:59.056
and all I have to know is
what's left of our assets.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.758
You're not the only one
who needs satellite time.

30:00.958 --> 30:02.760
We've got the <i>Ares 4</i>
supply missions coming up.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.929
We should be focusing on
the Schiaparelli Crater.

30:05.129 --> 30:05.962
Okay, we got 12 satellites up there.

30:06.162 --> 30:07.365
Surely we can spare a few hours...

30:07.565 --> 30:09.465
It's not about the satellite time, Vince.

30:09.665 --> 30:10.901
We're a public domain organization.

30:11.101 --> 30:11.935
We need to be transparent on this.

30:12.135 --> 30:13.269
Okay.

30:13.469 --> 30:15.039
The second we point the
satellites at the Hab...

30:15.239 --> 30:16.139
I broadcast pictures

30:16.339 --> 30:17.907
of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.742
You're afraid of a PR problem?

30:19.942 --> 30:21.311
Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem.

30:21.511 --> 30:22.914
Another mission?

30:23.114 --> 30:25.517
Congress won't reimburse
us for a paper clip...

30:25.717 --> 30:27.116
if I put a dead astronaut on the front page

30:27.316 --> 30:28.752
of <i>The Washington Post.</i>

30:28.952 --> 30:31.654
He's not going anywhere,
Teddy. I mean, he's not...

30:31.854 --> 30:33.624
He's not gonna decompose, you know.

30:33.824 --> 30:35.125
He's gonna be up there forever.

30:35.325 --> 30:37.994
Meteorology estimates that
he'll be covered in sand...

30:38.194 --> 30:39.931
from normal weather activity within a year.

30:40.131 --> 30:41.866
We can't wait a year. We got work to do.

30:42.066 --> 30:43.433
<i>Ares 5</i> won't even
launch for five years.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.202
We have plenty of time.

30:45.402 --> 30:46.870
Okay.

30:47.738 --> 30:49.407
Okay.

30:50.207 --> 30:52.377
Okay, consider this.

30:52.909 --> 30:56.279
Right now, the world's on our side.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.048
Sympathy for the Watney family.

30:58.248 --> 31:01.417
<i>Ares 6</i> could bring his body home.

31:01.617 --> 31:03.320
Now, we don't say that's
the purpose of the mission...

31:03.520 --> 31:05.321
but we make it clear that
that would be a part of it.

31:05.521 --> 31:07.124
We frame it that way.

31:07.324 --> 31:10.928
More support from Congress.
But not if we wait a year.

31:11.394 --> 31:13.430
We wait a year, nobody gives a shit.

31:46.296 --> 31:48.065
Vincent Kapoor?

31:53.136 --> 31:55.439
6-2.

31:55.639 --> 31:57.842
7-6-2.

32:00.877 --> 32:03.881
Acidalia Planitia.

32:14.424 --> 32:15.926
What?

32:30.607 --> 32:31.908
Hi. Security?

32:32.108 --> 32:33.877
This is Mindy Park in SatCon.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.681
I need the emergency
contact for Vincent Kapoor.

32:36.881 --> 32:38.715
Yes, him.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.018
Yes, it's an emergency!

32:45.855 --> 32:47.157
How sure?

32:47.357 --> 32:48.892
100%.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.061
You've got to be shitting me.

32:51.961 --> 32:53.965
Prove it to me.

32:55.232 --> 32:56.967
For a start...

32:57.968 --> 33:00.203
the solar panels have been cleaned.

33:00.403 --> 33:01.771
They could have been cleaned by wind.

33:01.971 --> 33:04.308
Back it up. Look at <i>Rover 2.</i>

33:04.508 --> 33:05.541
According to the logs,

33:05.741 --> 33:06.644
Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17...

33:06.844 --> 33:09.113
plugged it into the Hab to recharge.

33:09.313 --> 33:10.847
It's been moved.

33:11.047 --> 33:12.549
She could have forgotten to log the move.

33:12.749 --> 33:14.084
No, not likely.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.419
Why don't we just ask Lewis?

33:15.619 --> 33:17.221
Let's get on CAPCOM and
ask her directly right now.

33:17.421 --> 33:18.289
No. No.

33:18.489 --> 33:19.623
If Watney is really alive,

33:19.823 --> 33:21.692
we don't want the <i>Ares 3</i> crew to know.

33:21.892 --> 33:23.327
How can you not tell them?

33:23.527 --> 33:25.462
They have another 10
months on their trip home.

33:25.662 --> 33:26.797
Space travel is dangerous.

33:26.997 --> 33:28.532
They need to be alert and undistracted.

33:28.732 --> 33:29.933
But they already think he's dead.

33:30.133 --> 33:30.968
And they'd be devastated to find out

33:31.168 --> 33:33.136
they left him there alive.

33:33.336 --> 33:35.539
I'm sorry, but you
have not thought this through.

33:35.739 --> 33:38.709
What are we gonna say? "Dear America...

33:38.909 --> 33:40.444
"remember that astronaut we killed

33:40.644 --> 33:42.078
"and had a really nice funeral for?

33:42.278 --> 33:44.682
"Turns out he's alive and
we left him on Mars. Our bad.

33:44.882 --> 33:46.482
"Sincerely, NASA."

33:46.682 --> 33:49.051
Do you realize the shitstorm
that is about to hit us?

33:49.251 --> 33:51.022
How are we going to handle the public?

33:52.154 --> 33:54.625
Legally, we have 24 hours
to release these pictures.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.027
We release a statement with them.

33:56.227 --> 33:58.348
We don't want people
working it out on their own.

33:58.562 --> 34:00.164
Yes, sir.

34:00.364 --> 34:01.898
But if my math is right,
he's going to starve to death

34:02.098 --> 34:03.934
long before we can help him.

34:06.737 --> 34:08.938
Can you imagine what he's
going through up there?

34:09.139 --> 34:10.774
He's 50 million miles away from home.

34:10.974 --> 34:12.141
He thinks he's totally alone.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.210
He thinks we gave up on him.

34:14.945 --> 34:17.813
What does that do to
a man, psychologically?

34:19.047 --> 34:21.217
What the hell is he thinking right now?

34:25.255 --> 34:27.991
<i>I'm definitely gonna die up here...</i>

34:28.190 --> 34:32.094
<i>if I have to listen to any
more god-awful disco music.</i>

34:32.295 --> 34:33.929
My God, Commander Lewis,

34:34.130 --> 34:35.866
couldn't you have packed
anything from this century?

34:36.065 --> 34:38.668
<i>♪ Turn the beat around ♪</i>

34:38.869 --> 34:40.737
No, I am not gonna "turn the beat around."

34:40.938 --> 34:42.774
I refuse to.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.541
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?

34:46.909 --> 34:47.877
What attempts have been made

34:48.077 --> 34:49.712
to make contact with Mark Watney?

34:49.911 --> 34:51.982
We're working on it.

34:52.181 --> 34:53.581
Does he have enough supplies to survive?

34:53.782 --> 34:55.351
We'll be looking into that.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.687
What does this say about the agency?

34:56.887 --> 34:57.754
Are you gonna resign?

34:57.954 --> 34:58.990
No.

34:59.190 --> 35:00.959
Director Sanders!

35:05.262 --> 35:07.865
<i>It's time to
start thinking long term.</i>

35:08.065 --> 35:10.299
<i>The next NASA mission is</i> Ares 4...

35:10.499 --> 35:12.868
<i>and it's supposed to land
at Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

35:13.068 --> 35:15.406
<i>3200 kilometers away.</i>

35:15.606 --> 35:19.977
3,200 kilometers.

35:20.177 --> 35:22.345
<i>In four years, when the
next</i> Ares <i>crew arrives,</i>

35:22.545 --> 35:24.181
<i>I'll have to be there.</i>

35:25.115 --> 35:27.117
<i>Which means I have
to get to the crater.</i>

35:29.186 --> 35:31.020
<i>Okay, so here's the rub.</i>

35:31.220 --> 35:32.924
<i>I've got one working Rover</i>

35:33.124 --> 35:36.593
<i>designed to go a max
distance of 35 kilometers...</i>

35:36.793 --> 35:40.029
<i>before the battery has to
be recharged at the Hab.</i>

35:40.229 --> 35:42.165
<i>That's Problem A.</i>

35:42.365 --> 35:45.535
<i>Problem B is this
journey's gonna take me</i>

35:45.735 --> 35:48.971
<i>roughly 50 days to complete.</i>

35:49.171 --> 35:51.475
<i>So I gotta live for 50 days...</i>

35:51.675 --> 35:53.609
<i>inside a Rover with
marginal life support</i>

35:53.809 --> 35:55.345
<i>the size of a small van.</i>

35:58.081 --> 35:59.515
<i>So, in the face of overwhelming odds,</i>

35:59.715 --> 36:02.252
<i>I'm left with only one option.</i>

36:02.452 --> 36:05.890
<i>I'm gonna have to science
the shit out of this.</i>

36:32.148 --> 36:35.186
Okay, so, success.

36:35.918 --> 36:37.754
Uh...

36:39.789 --> 36:44.095
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging <i>Rover 1.</i>

36:44.961 --> 36:48.099
But if I use the heater...

36:49.298 --> 36:53.905
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

36:55.271 --> 36:59.176
If I do not use my heater, I will be...

37:00.376 --> 37:03.379
slowly killed by
the laws of thermodynamics.

37:03.579 --> 37:05.883
I would love to solve
this problem right now

37:06.083 --> 37:08.718
but unfortunately...

37:08.918 --> 37:11.723
<i>my balls are frozen.</i>

37:13.356 --> 37:15.392
I can't. I'm calling it. I'm calling it.

37:27.603 --> 37:29.473
<i>Good news, I may have a solution</i>

37:29.673 --> 37:31.207
<i>to my heating problem.</i>

37:31.407 --> 37:33.544
<i>Bad news, it involves me digging up</i>

37:33.744 --> 37:36.346
<i>the Radioisotope
Thermoelectric Generator.</i>

37:36.546 --> 37:38.549
<i>Now, if I remember my
training correctly,</i>

37:38.749 --> 37:40.616
<i>one of the lessons was titled...</i>

37:40.816 --> 37:43.986
<i>"Don't Dig Up the Big
Box of Plutonium, Mark."</i>

37:44.186 --> 37:46.022
<i>I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft,</i>

37:46.222 --> 37:47.857
<i>but if they rupture around humans...</i>

37:48.057 --> 37:49.292
<i>no more humans.</i>

37:49.492 --> 37:51.361
<i>Which is why we buried
it when we arrived.</i>

37:51.795 --> 37:53.129
<i>And planted that flag...</i>

37:53.329 --> 37:54.497
<i>so we would never be stupid enough</i>

37:54.697 --> 37:57.200
<i>to accidentally go near it again.</i>

37:57.666 --> 37:59.870
<i>But as long as I don't break it...</i>

38:00.070 --> 38:01.205
<i>I almost just said</i>

38:01.405 --> 38:03.272
<i>"Everything will be fine" out loud.</i>

38:03.472 --> 38:05.241
Look, the point is, I'm not cold anymore.

38:05.441 --> 38:06.875
And sure, I could choose to think

38:07.075 --> 38:08.278
about the fact that I'm warm...

38:08.478 --> 38:10.314
because I have a decaying

38:10.514 --> 38:12.348
radioactive isotope
riding right behind me...

38:12.548 --> 38:15.118
but right now, I got
bigger problems on my hands.

38:15.318 --> 38:17.520
<i>I have scoured every single data file</i>

38:17.720 --> 38:19.756
<i>on Commander Lewis' personal drive.</i>

38:19.956 --> 38:24.427
<i>This is officially the
least disco song she owns.</i>

38:25.295 --> 38:26.964
<i>♪ Lookin' for some hot stuff</i>

38:27.164 --> 38:29.031
<i>♪ Baby, this evenin'</i>

38:29.231 --> 38:32.336
<i>♪ I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight</i>

38:33.503 --> 38:37.807
<i>♪ I want some hot
stuff, baby, this evenin'</i>

38:38.007 --> 38:42.078
<i>♪ Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight</i>

38:42.278 --> 38:44.282
<i>♪ Hot stuff</i>

38:45.182 --> 38:48.319
<i>♪ I need hot stuff</i>

38:49.219 --> 38:52.222
<i>♪ I want some hot stuff</i>

38:53.190 --> 38:56.260
<i>♪ I need hot stuff ♪</i>

38:59.061 --> 39:00.596
- Yeah.
- Where is Watney going?

39:00.796 --> 39:03.066
We believe that he's
preparing for a journey.

39:03.266 --> 39:05.267
He's been conducting incremental tests...

39:05.467 --> 39:06.770
taking the <i>Rover 2</i> out for longer

39:06.970 --> 39:08.838
and longer trips each time.

39:10.706 --> 39:11.975
To what end? Why would he leave

39:12.175 --> 39:13.510
the relative safety of the Hab?

39:13.710 --> 39:15.011
Well, we think that he plans to travel

39:15.211 --> 39:16.513
to the <i>Ares 4</i> launch site...

39:16.713 --> 39:18.015
in order to make contact with us,

39:18.215 --> 39:19.816
but it would be a dangerous gamble.

39:20.016 --> 39:21.185
<i>But if we could talk to him,</i>

39:21.385 --> 39:22.685
<i>we would tell him to stay put...</i>

39:22.885 --> 39:25.120
<i>and to trust that we are
doing everything in our power</i>

39:25.320 --> 39:27.223
<i>to bring him home alive.</i>

39:27.423 --> 39:29.526
Thank you very much.

39:31.860 --> 39:33.964
Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.198
You know what? These
interviews aren't easy.

39:36.398 --> 39:37.801
So God forbid I try to say something

39:38.001 --> 39:39.470
proactive and positive.

39:39.670 --> 39:40.638
Annie.

39:40.838 --> 39:43.372
No more Vincent on TV. Copy that.

39:43.572 --> 39:46.743
76 kilometers. Am I reading that right?

39:46.943 --> 39:48.078
Are you asking me?

39:48.278 --> 39:49.113
I am.

39:49.313 --> 39:50.647
Yes, sir.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.749
Mark drove two hours
straightaway from the Hab...

39:53.949 --> 39:55.953
did a short EVA and then
drove for another two.

39:56.153 --> 39:58.654
We think the EVA was to change batteries.

39:58.854 --> 39:59.990
He didn't load up the oxygenator

40:00.190 --> 40:01.591
or the water reclaimer?

40:01.791 --> 40:04.426
Every 41 hours, there's a 17 minute gap.

40:04.626 --> 40:06.528
It's just the way the orbits work...

40:06.728 --> 40:09.566
so it's possible that we missed something.

40:09.766 --> 40:11.301
I want that gap down to four minutes.

40:11.501 --> 40:13.336
I'm giving you total authority

40:13.536 --> 40:15.506
over satellite trajectories
and orbital adjustments.

40:15.706 --> 40:16.740
Make it happen.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.441
Okay.

40:18.941 --> 40:21.178
Let's assume Miss Park
didn't miss anything.

40:21.378 --> 40:24.546
So Mark's not going to <i>Ares 4.</i> Yet.

40:24.746 --> 40:25.915
But he's smart enough to figure out

40:26.115 --> 40:28.352
that's his only chance.

40:28.552 --> 40:31.187
Bruce, what's the earliest
we can get a pre-supply there?

40:31.387 --> 40:33.390
<i>With the positions of Earth and Mars,</i>

40:33.590 --> 40:35.926
<i>it'll take nine months.</i>

40:36.760 --> 40:38.595
<i>It'll take six months to
build it in the first place.</i>

40:38.795 --> 40:40.028
Three months.

40:40.228 --> 40:41.531
Three?

40:41.731 --> 40:42.665
<i>You're going
to say it's impossible</i>

40:42.865 --> 40:44.299
<i>and then I'm gonna make a speech...</i>

40:44.499 --> 40:45.301
<i>about the blinding capabilities</i>

40:45.501 --> 40:46.703
<i>of the JPL team...</i>

40:46.903 --> 40:47.870
<i>and then you're going to do the math</i>

40:48.070 --> 40:49.205
<i>in your head and say something like...</i>

40:49.405 --> 40:51.274
"The overtime alone will be a nightmare."

40:51.474 --> 40:53.142
<i>The overtime alone will be a nightmare.</i>

40:53.342 --> 40:54.343
Get started.

40:54.543 --> 40:56.347
I'll find you the money.

40:57.213 --> 40:59.082
We need to tell the crew.

40:59.282 --> 40:59.982
Mitch, we've discussed this.

41:00.182 --> 41:01.785
No, you discussed this.

41:01.985 --> 41:05.388
I'm the one who decides
what's best for the crew.

41:06.389 --> 41:08.125
They deserve to know.

41:09.525 --> 41:11.060
Once there's a real rescue
plan, we'll tell them.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.930
Otherwise, it's moot.

41:13.130 --> 41:15.531
Bruce has three months
to get the payload done.

41:15.731 --> 41:17.267
That's all that matters right now.

41:17.467 --> 41:19.069
<i>We'll do our best.</i>

41:19.269 --> 41:22.106
Mark dies if you don't.

41:23.706 --> 41:27.042
<i>It's been 48 sols
since I planted the potatoes.</i>

41:27.242 --> 41:29.245
<i>So now it's time to reap and re-sow.</i>

41:29.445 --> 41:31.881
<i>They grew even better than I expected.</i>

41:32.081 --> 41:35.084
<i>I now have 400 healthy potato plants.</i>

41:35.284 --> 41:38.254
<i>I dug them up, being careful
to leave their plants alive.</i>

41:38.454 --> 41:39.857
<i>The smaller ones I'll reseed,</i>

41:40.057 --> 41:42.325
<i>the larger ones are my food supply.</i>

41:42.525 --> 41:46.229
<i>All natural, organic,
Martian-grown potatoes.</i>

41:46.429 --> 41:49.265
<i>You don't hear that every day, do you?</i>

41:49.465 --> 41:51.066
<i>And by the way, none of
this matters at all...</i>

41:51.266 --> 41:54.604
<i>if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA.</i>

42:15.758 --> 42:17.561
<i>I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

42:45.956 --> 42:47.055
Oh! He's moving again.

42:47.255 --> 42:49.660
Where the hell is he going?

42:49.860 --> 42:51.995
He hasn't changed course for 13 days.

42:52.195 --> 42:54.464
He's nowhere near the <i>Ares 4.</i>

42:54.664 --> 42:56.432
Unless he's not taking a direct route.

42:56.632 --> 43:00.370
He might be trying to avoid some obstacle.

43:00.570 --> 43:02.171
What obstacle?

43:02.371 --> 43:03.674
It's Acidalia Planitia.

43:03.874 --> 43:05.843
There's nothing out there except the...

43:08.045 --> 43:09.680
What?

43:12.615 --> 43:15.151
I need a map.

43:20.956 --> 43:22.625
Yeah.

43:22.825 --> 43:24.093
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

43:24.293 --> 43:25.127
It's all right. It's all right.

43:25.327 --> 43:26.596
Can I borrow this?

43:26.796 --> 43:28.698
Okay, so where is the Hab location?

43:28.898 --> 43:31.368
31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.

43:31.568 --> 43:32.602
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

43:32.802 --> 43:34.703
- Where's Watney?
- Uh...

43:34.903 --> 43:35.872
There.

43:36.072 --> 43:37.574
Okay.

43:43.445 --> 43:46.381
Okay. I know where he's going.

43:46.581 --> 43:48.518
I need to get on an airplane.

44:20.717 --> 44:21.885
Vincent, how are you?

44:22.085 --> 44:23.220
Good to see you.

44:23.420 --> 44:24.687
- Good flight?
- Uh...

44:24.887 --> 44:26.389
Yeah.

44:26.856 --> 44:29.693
It's in storage just around the corner.

45:03.726 --> 45:04.861
Hey, Vincent, nice to see you again.

45:05.061 --> 45:06.196
Nice to see you.

45:06.396 --> 45:08.564
What are the chances Mark
can get it working again?

45:08.764 --> 45:12.301
It's hard to say. We lost contact in '97.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.537
We think it was battery failure.

45:14.737 --> 45:15.805
Though I'd like to point out

45:16.005 --> 45:18.542
it lasted three times longer
than expected in any...

45:18.742 --> 45:19.841
Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce.

45:20.041 --> 45:20.977
I just need to speak to everybody

45:21.177 --> 45:22.111
that was here in '97.

45:22.311 --> 45:23.912
They're already here. Guys.

45:24.112 --> 45:25.515
I'd like to introduce Vincent Kapoor.

45:25.715 --> 45:27.350
Director of Mars Missions for NASA.

45:27.550 --> 45:28.852
This is our current team...

45:29.452 --> 45:31.854
and our original project members.

45:47.603 --> 45:49.138
- Is this the replica?
- This is her.

45:49.338 --> 45:51.441
Okay. Let's see it.

45:51.641 --> 45:53.577
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

45:58.581 --> 46:00.584
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

47:10.820 --> 47:13.390
Come on. Come on.

47:33.443 --> 47:35.812
Holy shit. Okay.

47:36.311 --> 47:37.580
"Broadcasting status.

47:37.780 --> 47:38.848
"Listening for telemetry signal."

47:39.048 --> 47:40.584
Uh-huh.

47:41.217 --> 47:43.320
Okay. Signal acquired.

47:44.586 --> 47:45.388
- All right.
- Okay.

47:45.588 --> 47:47.358
Camera.

48:36.739 --> 48:38.542
Incoming.

48:40.409 --> 48:43.647
"Are you receiving me?"

48:43.847 --> 48:46.382
"Yes. No."

48:47.918 --> 48:50.252
Okay, point the camera at "yes."

48:50.452 --> 48:52.955
32-minute round-trip
communications time.

48:53.155 --> 48:54.490
All he can do is ask yes or no questions...

48:54.690 --> 48:56.625
and all we can do is point the camera.

48:56.825 --> 48:57.794
This won't exactly be
an Algonquin Round Table

48:57.994 --> 48:59.129
of snappy repartee.

48:59.329 --> 49:01.029
- Are you kidding me?
- Tim, Tim.

49:01.229 --> 49:03.265
- Just point the camera.
- Roger that.

49:03.465 --> 49:06.035
Pointing the camera.

49:16.845 --> 49:18.515
Whoo!

49:20.282 --> 49:21.784
Yes!

49:22.717 --> 49:24.220
Yes!

49:25.454 --> 49:27.624
<i>So here's the rub.</i>

49:27.824 --> 49:30.060
<i>Somehow we have to have complex</i>

49:30.260 --> 49:31.901
<i>astrophysical engineering
conversations...</i>

49:33.161 --> 49:36.732
<i>using nothing but a
still-frame camera...</i>

49:36.932 --> 49:39.068
<i>from 1996.</i>

49:41.771 --> 49:43.740
<i>Luckily...</i>

49:45.007 --> 49:47.375
<i>the camera does spin.</i>

49:47.575 --> 49:49.645
So I can make an alphabet.

49:49.845 --> 49:51.580
It can't be our alphabet.

49:51.780 --> 49:54.084
26 characters plus a question card

49:54.284 --> 49:56.553
into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc.

49:56.753 --> 49:58.153
That's way too narrow.

49:58.353 --> 50:01.224
I'd never know what the
camera was pointing at.

50:07.463 --> 50:09.099
Ooh.

50:13.336 --> 50:14.905
Hexadecimals.

50:18.974 --> 50:20.776
Hexadecimals to the rescue.

50:20.976 --> 50:22.211
<i>I figured one of you guys</i>

50:22.411 --> 50:24.446
<i>kept an ASCII table lying around.</i>

50:24.646 --> 50:25.747
<i>And I was right.</i>

50:25.947 --> 50:27.049
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

50:27.249 --> 50:30.620
<i>I give you super-nerd Beth Johanssen.</i>

50:30.820 --> 50:33.656
<i>Who also had copies of</i> Zork II...

50:33.856 --> 50:36.659
<i>and</i> Leather Goddesses of
Phobos <i>on her personal laptop.</i>

50:37.927 --> 50:39.395
<i>Seriously, Johanssen...</i>

50:39.595 --> 50:42.165
it's like the Smithsonian
of loneliness on there.

50:42.365 --> 50:44.267
- <i>Not that I'm complaining.</i>
- Yes!

50:44.467 --> 50:46.870
<i>Who am I to talk about loneliness?</i>

51:06.722 --> 51:09.158
I know where he's going with this.

51:56.806 --> 51:58.807
"F, O."

51:59.007 --> 52:01.210
"7, W."

52:18.594 --> 52:19.562
Vincent.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.831
Vincent, wake up.

52:33.976 --> 52:36.778
<i>Now that we can have more
complicated conversations...</i>

52:36.978 --> 52:39.048
<i>the smart people at NASA
have sent me instructions</i>

52:39.248 --> 52:40.783
<i>on how to hack the Rover...</i>

52:40.983 --> 52:43.051
<i>so that it can talk to</i> Pathfinder.

52:43.251 --> 52:45.220
<i>If I hack a tiny bit of code...</i>

52:45.420 --> 52:48.457
<i>just 20 instructions in the
Rover's operating system...</i>

52:48.657 --> 52:49.993
<i>NASA can link the Rover to</i> Pathfinder's

53:07.777 --> 53:09.044
"Mark...

53:09.244 --> 53:11.881
"this is Vincent Kapoor.

53:12.081 --> 53:15.452

<i>"We're working on rescue plans.</i>

<i>"Meantime, we're putting

53:28.998 --> 53:33.903
"to keep you fed until <i>Ares 4</i> arrives."

53:50.385 --> 53:51.921
Okay.

54:01.396 --> 54:02.865
Okay.

54:03.532 --> 54:05.768
"Glad to hear it. Really
looking forward to not dying."

54:17.979 --> 54:19.582
"How's the crew?"

54:19.782 --> 54:22.753
"What did they say when
they found out I was alive?"

54:43.405 --> 54:45.640
Guys, can we get some space please?

54:45.840 --> 54:46.709
Me?

54:46.909 --> 54:48.044
Yeah, you.

54:48.244 --> 54:50.046
Give me a sec.

54:55.985 --> 54:57.988
Just tell him.

55:06.461 --> 55:12.568
"We haven't told the
crew you are alive yet.

55:14.202 --> 55:18.575
"We need them to concentrate
on their mission."

55:30.887 --> 55:33.557
What the fuck?

55:34.023 --> 55:35.492
What the fuck?

55:42.532 --> 55:45.066
Okay, he says, "They don't know I'm alive?

55:45.266 --> 55:47.035
"What the..." F-word.

55:47.235 --> 55:48.403
F-word in gerund form.

55:48.603 --> 55:50.206
F-word, again, "is wrong with you?"

55:52.742 --> 55:56.145
"Mark, please watch your language.

55:56.345 --> 55:58.314
"Everything you type

55:58.514 --> 56:03.053
"is being broadcast
live all over the world."

56:05.086 --> 56:06.590
Yeah?

56:14.597 --> 56:15.764
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

56:18.501 --> 56:19.568
Yes, sir.

56:19.768 --> 56:22.071
He is under a tremendous amount of stress.

56:23.206 --> 56:24.767
I understand. We're working on it.

56:25.173 --> 56:26.841
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.

56:27.041 --> 56:28.978
Thank you, Mr. President.

56:30.478 --> 56:31.647
Problem is, Mark's right.

56:31.847 --> 56:34.015
The longer we wait, the
worse it's gonna get.

56:34.215 --> 56:35.584
We need to tell the crew.

56:35.784 --> 56:38.252
You're bringing this up while
Vincent is in Pasadena...

56:38.452 --> 56:39.988
so he can't argue the other side.

56:40.188 --> 56:41.524
I shouldn't have to answer to Vincent.

56:41.724 --> 56:43.660
Or anyone else.

56:45.394 --> 56:47.430
It's time, Teddy.

57:11.119 --> 57:12.488
<i>Commander Lewis?</i>

57:12.688 --> 57:14.157
Go ahead.

57:14.722 --> 57:16.592
<i>Data dump is almost complete.</i>

57:17.425 --> 57:19.695
Copy that. On my way.

57:32.273 --> 57:33.575
You're in a hurry.

57:33.775 --> 57:35.078
Yeah.

57:35.278 --> 57:37.113
My son turned three yesterday.

57:37.313 --> 57:39.448
Should be pictures of the party.

57:49.624 --> 57:51.426
Got a batch of personals.

57:51.626 --> 57:54.164
Dispatching them to your laptops now.

57:55.097 --> 57:58.200
I don't need to read Vogel's
weird German fetish emails.

57:58.400 --> 58:00.202
They're telemetry updates.

58:00.402 --> 58:02.003
Hey, whatever does it for you, man.

58:03.072 --> 58:04.339
There's a video message.

58:04.539 --> 58:06.475
It's addressed to the whole crew.

58:06.675 --> 58:09.211
Play it. Come on, guys.

58:09.411 --> 58:11.079
I wanna get in on
that telemetry action.

58:14.983 --> 58:18.020
<i>Hi, hello. It's Mitch. Mitch Henderson.</i>

58:18.220 --> 58:20.189
<i>I have some news.</i>

58:20.389 --> 58:23.459
<i>There's no subtle way to put this.</i>

58:23.659 --> 58:25.528
<i>Mark Watney is still alive.</i>

58:25.728 --> 58:27.562
Oh, my God.

58:27.762 --> 58:29.798
<i>I know that's a surprise and I know</i>

58:29.998 --> 58:31.332
<i>you will have a lot of questions.</i>

58:31.532 --> 58:34.303
<i>But here are the basics.</i>

58:34.503 --> 58:37.340
<i>He's alive and he's healthy.</i>

58:38.807 --> 58:42.377
<i>We found out two months ago
and decided not to tell you.</i>

58:42.577 --> 58:43.845
- Two months?
- Oh, my God.

58:44.045 --> 58:46.682
<i>I was strongly
against that decision.</i>

58:46.882 --> 58:49.685
<i>We're telling you now because...</i>

58:49.885 --> 58:52.354
<i>we finally have
communication with him...</i>

58:52.554 --> 58:55.490
<i>and a viable rescue plan.</i>

58:55.690 --> 58:57.526
<i>We'll give you a write-up
of what happened,</i>

58:57.726 --> 58:59.093
<i>a full write-up of everything.</i>

58:59.293 --> 59:00.796
<i>But it's not your fault.</i>

59:00.996 --> 59:04.066
<i>Mark stresses that
every time it comes up.</i>

59:04.532 --> 59:07.503
<i>So... Yeah...</i>

59:09.170 --> 59:11.506
<i>Take some time to absorb this.</i>

59:11.706 --> 59:14.209
<i>And send all the questions you want.</i>

59:14.409 --> 59:16.312
<i>We'll answer them.</i>

59:17.313 --> 59:19.115
<i>All right. Henderson out.</i>

59:19.315 --> 59:21.417
Holy shit, he's alive.

59:22.016 --> 59:23.185
I left him behind.

59:23.385 --> 59:24.220
- No.
- No.

59:24.420 --> 59:26.055
We all left together.

59:26.255 --> 59:28.390
You were following orders.

59:31.527 --> 59:34.129
I left him behind.

59:43.572 --> 59:44.272
<i>So now that
NASA can talk to me,</i>

59:44.472 --> 59:46.075
<i>they won't shut up.</i>

59:46.275 --> 59:48.845
<i>They want constant updates
on every Hab system...</i>

59:49.045 --> 59:50.578
<i>and they got a room full of people</i>

59:50.778 --> 59:52.548
<i>trying to micromanage my crops.</i>

59:52.748 --> 59:54.684
<i>Which is awesome.</i>

59:55.383 --> 59:57.453
<i>Look, I don't mean to sound
arrogant or anything...</i>

59:57.653 --> 01:00:02.492
<i>but I am the greatest
botanist on this planet, so...</i>

01:00:03.492 --> 01:00:04.794
<i>One big bonus</i>

01:00:04.994 --> 01:00:06.796
<i>to this communication
with NASA again...</i>

01:00:06.996 --> 01:00:08.430
<i>is the email. I'm getting them again.</i>

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:10.799
<i>Big data dumps like when
I was on the</i> Hermes.

01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:12.868
<i>I even got one from the president.</i>

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:15.537
<i>The coolest one, though,
the coolest one I got...</i>

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:16.772
<i>was from University of Chicago,</i>

01:00:16.972 --> 01:00:18.540
<i>my alma mater.</i>

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.209
They say that once you
grow crops somewhere...

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:23.612
you've officially colonized it.

01:00:24.112 --> 01:00:26.716
<i>So, technically...</i>

01:00:27.382 --> 01:00:29.284
<i>I colonized Mars.</i>

01:00:33.722 --> 01:00:36.192
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:38.426
In other news, there's been a request...

01:00:38.626 --> 01:00:40.162
for me to pose for a photograph

01:00:40.362 --> 01:00:42.731
on my next transmission.

01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:44.499
I'm trying to figure out whether

01:00:44.699 --> 01:00:47.368
I should go with "High School Senior"...

01:00:47.568 --> 01:00:50.874
or "coquettish ingenue."

01:00:52.574 --> 01:00:53.776
But I'm not really sure

01:00:53.976 --> 01:00:55.897
how that's gonna look with my spacesuit on.

01:01:21.503 --> 01:01:23.239
Hey!

01:01:25.273 --> 01:01:26.841
What is he doing?

01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:29.111
I asked for a photo,
and what, he's The Fonz?

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:30.912
<i>Just be grateful we got
you something, Annie.</i>

01:01:31.112 --> 01:01:33.082
I can't use this,
Vincent, and you know that.

01:01:33.282 --> 01:01:34.582
I need a picture of his face.

01:01:34.782 --> 01:01:36.318
<i>I could tell him to
take off his helmet...</i>

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:38.086
but then he'd, you know, die, so...

01:01:39.688 --> 01:01:40.589
<i>We'll release the photo</i>

01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:41.890
<i>when we detail the rescue operation.</i>

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:43.725
I want to announce we're launching

01:01:43.925 --> 01:01:45.026
some supplies to him next year...

01:01:45.226 --> 01:01:47.229
during the Hohmann Transfer Window.

01:01:47.429 --> 01:01:49.598
Bruce, your team's still on schedule?

01:01:49.798 --> 01:01:51.533
<i>It'll be tight, but we'll make it.</i>

01:01:51.733 --> 01:01:53.435
Nine-month travel time.

01:01:53.635 --> 01:01:55.903
That puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868.

01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:58.006
Did we get the botany team's analysis?

01:01:58.206 --> 01:02:01.511
<i>Yeah, they estimate Mark's
crops will last till Sol 912.</i>

01:02:01.711 --> 01:02:04.046
<i>They grudgingly admit that
he's doing great work.</i>

01:02:04.246 --> 01:02:05.379
Grudgingly?

01:02:05.579 --> 01:02:06.415
<i>Yeah. Mark has a tendency to tell them</i>

01:02:06.615 --> 01:02:07.649
<i>to have sex with themselves...</i>

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.618
<i>whenever they question
one of his decisions.</i>

01:02:09.818 --> 01:02:10.720
Get him in line, Vincent.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.620
We can't afford any miscommunication.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.290
I hate this margin.

01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:18.394
912 Sols worth of food.
We get there on 868.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.698
And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

01:03:06.775 --> 01:03:09.277
<i>Suit breach detected.</i>

01:03:16.885 --> 01:03:19.821
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.038
<i>Oxygen level, 10%.</i>

01:03:50.418 --> 01:03:53.388
<i>Oxygen level, 5%.</i>

01:04:02.463 --> 01:04:04.666
<i>Suit pressure, stable.</i>

01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:02.651
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:39.088
God! God, God, God, God!

01:06:57.606 --> 01:06:59.540
Crops are dead.

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.875
Complete loss of pressure
boiled off most of the water.

01:07:02.075 --> 01:07:03.278
Any bacteria that survived,

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.080
died in the subzero temperatures...

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.015
when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.

01:07:07.215 --> 01:07:09.084
How long does he have?

01:07:10.418 --> 01:07:11.819
He can still
eat the potatoes he has,

01:07:12.019 --> 01:07:14.289
he just can't grow any more...

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:17.026
so give him 200 sols.

01:07:17.226 --> 01:07:20.162
Rations get him to what? Sol 409?

01:07:20.362 --> 01:07:23.131
Mmm-hmm. So with potatoes, 609.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.035
So by Sol 868, he'll be long dead.

01:07:26.235 --> 01:07:27.868
We're gonna have to launch
as soon as possible...

01:07:28.068 --> 01:07:29.838
which changes our travel time.

01:07:30.905 --> 01:07:32.807
Yeah, we're working on it.

01:07:33.474 --> 01:07:37.745
Prelim estimates call for a 414-day trip.

01:07:37.945 --> 01:07:40.149
It's Sol 135 now.

01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:42.316
We need 13 days to mount the boosters,

01:07:42.516 --> 01:07:43.752
perform inspections...

01:07:43.952 --> 01:07:47.055
which gives Bruce and his team...

01:07:47.255 --> 01:07:49.959
47 days to make this probe.

01:07:51.059 --> 01:07:54.597
I'll let you call Bruce, give him the news.

01:07:56.932 --> 01:07:58.868
Okay.

01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:04.773
I'm gonna need a change of clothes.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.017
<i>"Dear Mark...</i>

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:20.022
<i>"Apparently NASA's letting
us talk to you now.</i>

01:08:20.988 --> 01:08:24.859
"And I drew the short straw.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:31.832
<i>"Sorry we left you behind on Mars.</i>

01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:35.104
"But we just don't like you.

01:08:37.337 --> 01:08:42.877
"Also, it's a lot roomier on
the <i>Hermes</i> without you.

01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:46.747
<i>"We have to take turns
doing your tasks.</i>

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:50.018
"But, I mean, it's only botany.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.787
"It's not real science."

01:08:52.987 --> 01:08:54.657
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.158
<i>"How's Mars?"</i>

01:09:02.064 --> 01:09:05.234
<i>"Dear Martinez, Mars is fine.</i>

01:09:06.533 --> 01:09:09.370
<i>"I accidentally blew up the Hab...</i>

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:11.305
<i>"but unfortunately,</i>

"But unfortunately,

<i>"Every day, I go outside</i>

01:09:24.019 --> 01:09:26.687
<i>"and look at the vast horizons."</i>

"Every day, I go outside

01:09:28.323 --> 01:09:30.758

01:09:32.694 --> 01:09:35.162
"Just because I can.

"Tell the others I said hello."

01:09:40.903 --> 01:09:42.805
"Will do, buddy."

01:11:12.426 --> 01:11:14.362
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

01:11:53.801 --> 01:11:56.503
5, 10...

01:11:56.703 --> 01:11:59.407
15, 20, 30, 35...

01:12:00.874 --> 01:12:02.577
40.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:04.280
52.

01:12:32.774 --> 01:12:34.410
Rich.

01:12:35.075 --> 01:12:36.010
Rich.

01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:37.912
Wake up.

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.418
Sorry, but they're asking
for the probe courses.

01:12:42.618 --> 01:12:43.918
What time is it?

01:12:44.118 --> 01:12:46.454
It's 3:42.

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:54.028
Look, I know we're coming
at this backwards...

01:12:54.228 --> 01:12:55.730
but we can't commit to a firm launch date

01:12:55.930 --> 01:12:57.867
with this many unknowns.

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:00.368
It's all right. Um...

01:13:00.568 --> 01:13:03.204
All 25 models for launch will
take 414 days to reach Mars.

01:13:03.404 --> 01:13:05.007
They vary slightly in thrust duration...

01:13:05.207 --> 01:13:07.176
and the fuel requirement
is nearly identical.

01:13:08.243 --> 01:13:10.178
Not a good time to launch, is it?

01:13:10.378 --> 01:13:13.114
Yeah, Earth and Mars are
really badly positioned.

01:13:13.314 --> 01:13:15.484
Heck, it'd almost be easier if you...

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:19.488
Almost easier to what?

01:13:20.288 --> 01:13:21.957
I need more coffee.

01:13:22.157 --> 01:13:23.690
Ahh!

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:24.726
Are you all right?

01:13:24.926 --> 01:13:26.362
It's fine.

01:13:30.265 --> 01:13:32.468
Almost easier to what?

01:13:43.677 --> 01:13:46.115
You do understand I'm your boss, right?

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.116
Uh-huh.

01:13:51.319 --> 01:13:52.486
All right, let's ask

01:13:52.686 --> 01:13:55.390
the very, very expensive question.

01:13:55.856 --> 01:13:57.458
Is the probe going to be ready on time?

01:13:57.658 --> 01:13:59.394
<i>- We're behind.</i>
- Give me a number.

01:13:59.594 --> 01:14:02.897
<i>15 days. 15 days and I can get it done.</i>

01:14:03.097 --> 01:14:04.097
All right, let's create 15 days.

01:14:04.297 --> 01:14:05.766
13 days to mount the probe.

01:14:05.966 --> 01:14:07.435
Can we reduce?

01:14:07.635 --> 01:14:09.570
It actually only takes three
days to mount the probe.

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:11.472
And we can get that down to two, right?

01:14:11.672 --> 01:14:13.208
<i>I can get it down to two.</i>

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:14.909
10 days are for tests and inspections.

01:14:15.109 --> 01:14:18.012
How often do those
inspections reveal a problem?

01:14:19.014 --> 01:14:20.614
Are you suggesting we
don't do the inspections?

01:14:20.814 --> 01:14:22.784
Right now I'm asking how
often they reveal a problem.

01:14:22.984 --> 01:14:24.151
One in 20.

01:14:24.351 --> 01:14:25.787
But that's grounds for countdown halt.

01:14:25.987 --> 01:14:27.254
We can't take that chance.

01:14:27.454 --> 01:14:30.024
Anyone else know a safer
way to buy more time?

01:14:34.127 --> 01:14:36.530
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's
rations four more days.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:38.199
You're not gonna like it,
but that'll get us to 15.

01:14:38.399 --> 01:14:38.999
And we'll cancel the inspections.

01:14:39.199 --> 01:14:40.467
Teddy.

01:14:40.667 --> 01:14:42.337
- Sir, if that ever got out...
- It's on me.

01:14:42.537 --> 01:14:43.738
You got your two weeks.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:45.541
Get it done.

01:14:46.306 --> 01:14:48.375
So, now I have to hold out

01:14:48.575 --> 01:14:50.477
until the probe gets here with more food.

01:14:50.677 --> 01:14:53.114
You want to see what minimal
calorie count looks like?

01:14:53.314 --> 01:14:54.915
Standard issue ration.

01:14:55.115 --> 01:14:59.186
But instead of three of
these every one day...

01:14:59.386 --> 01:15:03.191
I'm now eating one of
these every three days.

01:15:04.425 --> 01:15:06.562
And now, they've asked me...

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:08.731
to do that.

01:15:13.167 --> 01:15:14.737
The point is...

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:19.308
<i>"stretch the rations four more days"...</i>

01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:22.210
<i>is a real dick-punch.</i>

01:15:25.747 --> 01:15:29.018
<i>I'm gonna dip this potato
in some crushed Vicodin.</i>

01:15:30.585 --> 01:15:32.621
And there's nobody who can stop me.

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:46.201
<i>It has been seven days
since I ran out of ketchup.</i>

01:15:57.846 --> 01:16:00.181
Up. Up, up. Yeah.

01:16:00.381 --> 01:16:02.316
Let's go up here.

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:04.117
Labels facing up.

01:16:08.989 --> 01:16:10.091
This is the flight director.

01:16:10.291 --> 01:16:11.959
Begin launch status check.

01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:14.663
Roger that, Flight.
Beginning launch status check.

01:16:14.863 --> 01:16:17.232
Do you believe in God, Vincent?

01:16:17.998 --> 01:16:19.500
Yeah.

01:16:20.268 --> 01:16:21.703
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,

01:16:21.903 --> 01:16:24.172
my mother's a Baptist, so, yeah...

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:26.408
I believe in several.

01:16:28.775 --> 01:16:30.744
We'll take all the help we can get.

01:16:30.944 --> 01:16:32.379
<i>Launch status check complete.</i>

01:16:32.579 --> 01:16:34.015
This is Flight.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:35.749
We are go for launch.

01:16:35.949 --> 01:16:36.818
<i>Proceeding with the count.</i>

01:16:37.018 --> 01:16:38.285
<i>10... 9...</i>

<i>Liftoff.</i>

01:16:51.966 --> 01:16:53.669
<i>Good thrust.</i>

01:16:57.337 --> 01:16:59.173
<i>Performance is nominal.</i>

01:17:12.721 --> 01:17:15.157
<i>The tail
is giving good data.</i>

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:17.726
<i>She's rock
solid at this point, Flight.</i>

01:17:17.926 --> 01:17:19.127
<i>TVCs look good.</i>

01:17:30.671 --> 01:17:32.392
We're getting a little shimmy, Flight.

01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.641
Say again?

01:17:34.841 --> 01:17:36.910
We are getting a very large precession.

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:38.580
Are we good?

01:17:39.847 --> 01:17:41.048
<i>Flight,
it's hitting the redline.</i>

01:17:41.248 --> 01:17:43.852
It's spinning on the long axis
around a 17-degree precession.

01:17:45.185 --> 01:17:46.454
Launch, what's happening?

01:17:46.654 --> 01:17:48.756
Force on Iris is 7 G's.

01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:51.477
We've lost
readings on the probe, Flight.

01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:57.499
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:02.236
We've lost it, Flight.

01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:06.740
SatCon?

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:07.875

<i>"thank you for being my mom and dad."</i>

01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:22.677
<i>We substituted protein cubes</i>

01:20:22.877 --> 01:20:24.546
<i>for the standard rations.</i>

01:20:24.746 --> 01:20:26.513

<i>Vincent, why wasn't this addressed</i>

01:20:34.721 --> 01:20:36.391
<i>in the inspections phase?</i>

01:20:36.591 --> 01:20:37.991
<i>In order to make our launch window,</i>

01:20:38.191 --> 01:20:40.728
<i>we were forced to
accelerate our schedule.</i>

01:20:41.849 --> 01:20:45.274
Their astronaut is going to die.

01:20:45.766 --> 01:20:48.595
Of course there are other ways...

01:20:49.292 --> 01:20:52.662
...the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:56.130
and it has enough fuel for
a Mars injection orbit.

01:20:56.866 --> 01:20:58.462
Why hasn't NASA approached us?

01:20:58.662 --> 01:20:59.799
They don't know.

01:21:00.563 --> 01:21:02.777
Our booster technology is classified.

01:21:05.221 --> 01:21:06.222
So if we do nothing...

01:21:08.861 --> 01:21:13.812
The world would never
know we could have helped.

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:16.772
Then, for the sake of argument,

01:21:17.511 --> 01:21:19.747
let's say we decide to help them...

01:21:20.071 --> 01:21:24.565
We'd be giving up a booster and effectively
cancelling Taiyang Shen.

01:21:24.765 --> 01:21:27.805
We need to keep this among scientists,

01:21:28.271 --> 01:21:30.190
a co-operation between space agencies.

01:21:32.445 --> 01:21:33.848
Yes.

01:21:34.881 --> 01:21:37.051
Yes, I understand.

01:21:39.753 --> 01:21:41.555
Thank you.

01:21:44.557 --> 01:21:45.760
Yes!

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.029
<i>All right.</i>

01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:49.762
Thanks to my uncle Tommy in China,

01:21:49.962 --> 01:21:51.899
we get another chance at this.

01:21:52.099 --> 01:21:55.202
Now, we finished the
<i>Iris</i> probe in 62 days.

01:21:55.402 --> 01:21:58.973
We are now gonna attempt
to finish it in 28.

01:22:24.431 --> 01:22:25.531
We can jettison any kind of landing system.

01:22:25.731 --> 01:22:26.967
We're only sending rations.

01:22:27.167 --> 01:22:29.437
We can crash-land on Mars.

01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:31.940
You should hang up the phone.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.807
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- My name is Rich Purnell.

01:22:34.007 --> 01:22:35.109
I work in Astrodynamics,

01:22:35.309 --> 01:22:37.230
and you should hang up the phone right now.

01:22:38.612 --> 01:22:40.014
All right, all right.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.149
I'm gonna call you back.

01:22:43.216 --> 01:22:44.985
I know how to save Mark Watney.

01:22:46.186 --> 01:22:48.355
Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.

01:22:48.555 --> 01:22:49.422
I've got a better way.

01:22:49.622 --> 01:22:50.591
Astrodynamics?

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:52.693
Yeah.

01:22:52.893 --> 01:22:55.596
What the hell is "Project Elrond"?

01:22:55.796 --> 01:22:56.530
I had to make something up.

01:22:56.730 --> 01:22:58.565
But "Elrond"?

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:00.635
Because it's a secret meeting.

01:23:00.835 --> 01:23:01.903
How do you know that?

01:23:02.103 --> 01:23:03.538
Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting"?

01:23:03.738 --> 01:23:06.140
<i>The Council of Elrond. It's
from</i> Lord of the Rings.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.241
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:08.441
It's the meeting where they decide

01:23:08.641 --> 01:23:09.776
to destroy the One Ring.

01:23:09.976 --> 01:23:11.412
<i>If we're gonna call
something "Project Elrond"...</i>

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.815
I would like my code
name to be "Glorfindel."

01:23:14.015 --> 01:23:16.083
Okay, I hate every one of you.

01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:18.418
What, Teddy doesn't
even know about this yet?

01:23:18.618 --> 01:23:19.887
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:23:20.087 --> 01:23:22.048
This is Rich
Purnell, Astrodynamics.

01:23:22.890 --> 01:23:24.324
Tell them what you just told me.

01:23:24.524 --> 01:23:27.896
I can get the <i>Hermes</i>
back to Mars by Sol 561.

01:23:29.297 --> 01:23:30.699
How?

01:23:34.502 --> 01:23:37.572
Could you stand right there for me, please?

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:39.673
Thanks.

01:23:39.873 --> 01:23:41.176
Right there. Great.

01:23:41.376 --> 01:23:45.780
And could you stand
right there? Right there.

01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:53.687
Okay, let's pretend that this
stapler is the <i>Hermes...</i>

01:23:53.887 --> 01:23:56.190
and you are...

01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:57.725
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

01:23:57.925 --> 01:24:01.495
Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA.

01:24:01.695 --> 01:24:03.964
Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:06.299
And right now, the <i>Hermes</i>
is headed towards you...

01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:08.770
starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.

01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:11.439
But instead, what I'm proposing is...

01:24:15.443 --> 01:24:17.677
we start accelerating immediately

01:24:17.877 --> 01:24:19.614
to preserve velocity and gain even more.

01:24:19.814 --> 01:24:20.681
We don't intercept with Earth at all...

01:24:20.881 --> 01:24:22.181
but we come close enough

01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:24.485
to get a gravity assist and adjust course.

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:26.888
While we're doing that...

01:24:28.721 --> 01:24:30.391
we resupply with the probe...

01:24:30.591 --> 01:24:31.659
The <i>Taiyang Shen.</i>

01:24:31.859 --> 01:24:33.293
...pick up whatever provisions we need...

01:24:33.493 --> 01:24:35.596
and now we're accelerating towards Mars.

01:24:37.997 --> 01:24:39.499
You're Mars.

01:24:39.699 --> 01:24:40.767
Now, we're going too fast

01:24:40.967 --> 01:24:42.535
at this point to fall into orbit...

01:24:42.735 --> 01:24:43.971
but we can do a flyby.

01:24:44.171 --> 01:24:45.172
<i>What good is a flyby</i>

01:24:45.372 --> 01:24:47.173
<i>if we can't get Watney off the surface?</i>

01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:50.043
Watney would intercept using the MAV.

01:24:50.243 --> 01:24:51.780
Ow!

01:24:54.948 --> 01:24:56.883
And then we just head home.

01:25:01.355 --> 01:25:04.059
I've done the math. It checks out.

01:25:05.391 --> 01:25:06.660
<i>- Rich.
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.727
Get out.

01:25:07.927 --> 01:25:09.598
All right.

01:25:15.636 --> 01:25:17.338
- Is he right?
- Yeah.

01:25:17.538 --> 01:25:19.940
Bruce, what do you think?

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:22.009
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:25.046
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

01:25:25.246 --> 01:25:26.446
Uh-huh.

01:25:26.646 --> 01:25:28.582
What am I missing? Why is that important?

01:25:28.782 --> 01:25:30.116
Because we can only do one.

01:25:30.316 --> 01:25:32.352
Send Watney enough food to
last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

01:25:32.552 --> 01:25:35.021
or send <i>Hermes</i>
back to get him right now.

01:25:35.221 --> 01:25:36.056
Both plans require the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:38.359
so we have to choose.

01:25:38.559 --> 01:25:39.994
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

01:25:40.194 --> 01:25:41.861
We'd be asking them to add

01:25:42.061 --> 01:25:45.365
533 extra days to their mission.

01:25:45.565 --> 01:25:47.606
Yeah. They wouldn't
hesitate, not for a second.

01:25:48.368 --> 01:25:50.003
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function for 533 days

01:25:50.203 --> 01:25:51.205
beyond the scheduled mission end?

01:25:51.405 --> 01:25:52.373
It should.

01:25:52.573 --> 01:25:54.542
Built to last the full <i>Ares</i> mission...

01:25:54.742 --> 01:25:57.144
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

01:25:57.344 --> 01:25:58.546
But if something goes wrong...

01:25:58.746 --> 01:26:00.381
Then we lose the crew.

01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:01.882
<i>So what? We
either have a high chance</i>

01:26:02.082 --> 01:26:04.051
<i>of killing one person...</i>

01:26:04.251 --> 01:26:06.654
<i>or a low chance of killing six people.</i>

01:26:06.854 --> 01:26:08.055
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

01:26:08.255 --> 01:26:09.757
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:11.491
He does.

01:26:11.691 --> 01:26:12.994
Yeah, well, bullshit.

01:26:13.194 --> 01:26:14.995
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

01:26:15.195 --> 01:26:16.830
We still have a chance to bring

01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:18.365
five astronauts home safe and sound.

01:26:18.565 --> 01:26:20.669
I'm not risking their lives.

01:26:21.268 --> 01:26:23.304
Let them make that decision.

01:26:23.837 --> 01:26:26.807
Mitch, we're going with option one.

01:26:28.175 --> 01:26:30.745
You goddamn coward.

01:26:48.496 --> 01:26:51.265
<i>- Johanssen?
- Yeah.</i>

01:26:51.465 --> 01:26:53.700
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:54.735
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

01:26:54.935 --> 01:26:55.602
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:26:55.802 --> 01:26:57.304
The gym.

01:27:18.725 --> 01:27:20.061
What's up?

01:27:20.261 --> 01:27:21.262
I just got an email from my wife

01:27:21.462 --> 01:27:24.431
and the subject line says, "Our children."

01:27:24.631 --> 01:27:27.001
My computer won't open the attachment.

01:27:27.835 --> 01:27:29.035
Okay.

01:27:29.235 --> 01:27:30.938
Let's take a look.

01:27:34.408 --> 01:27:35.977
Uh...

01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:38.346
Let's see.

01:27:40.212 --> 01:27:42.516
This isn't a JPEG.

01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:45.487
It's a plain ASCII text file.

01:27:48.188 --> 01:27:50.069
I don't really know what we're looking at.

01:27:51.158 --> 01:27:52.827
Does that make any sense to you?

01:27:54.761 --> 01:27:57.065
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

01:27:57.265 --> 01:28:00.234
It's a course maneuver for the <i>Hermes.</i>

01:28:05.506 --> 01:28:07.741
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:09.376
211 days later.

01:28:10.444 --> 01:28:12.279
Would it work?

01:28:12.479 --> 01:28:14.214
Mmm-hmm. We ran the
numbers. They check out.

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:15.850
It's a brilliant course.

01:28:16.050 --> 01:28:18.986
So why all the cloak and dagger?

01:28:19.186 --> 01:28:20.788
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

01:28:20.988 --> 01:28:22.957
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

01:28:23.157 --> 01:28:25.159
they'd have to send the
supply ship or we die.

01:28:25.359 --> 01:28:28.897
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

01:28:29.462 --> 01:28:32.299
So, are we gonna do it?

01:28:33.432 --> 01:28:35.235
If it was up to me, we'd
already be on our way.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:37.872
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

01:28:38.072 --> 01:28:39.239
Not this time.

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:42.577
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

01:28:43.176 --> 01:28:44.945
We're talking about mutiny here,

01:28:45.145 --> 01:28:46.413
which is not a word that I take lightly.

01:28:46.613 --> 01:28:49.283
So we do this together or not at all.

01:28:49.483 --> 01:28:52.418
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

01:28:52.618 --> 01:28:55.522
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

01:28:55.722 --> 01:28:58.424
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

01:28:58.624 --> 01:29:01.628
If we do everything perfectly...

01:29:01.828 --> 01:29:05.098
we add 533 days to our mission.

01:29:05.298 --> 01:29:09.070
533 more days before we
see our families again.

01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:13.707
533 days of unplanned space travel...

01:29:13.907 --> 01:29:15.342
where anything could go wrong.

01:29:15.542 --> 01:29:19.314
If it's mission critical, we die.

01:29:19.747 --> 01:29:20.881
Sign me up.

01:29:21.081 --> 01:29:22.315
All right, cowboy, slow down.

01:29:22.515 --> 01:29:24.452
You and I, we're military.

01:29:24.652 --> 01:29:25.953
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

01:29:26.153 --> 01:29:27.154
Yeah, there's that.

01:29:27.354 --> 01:29:28.588
And for the rest of you guys...

01:29:28.788 --> 01:29:31.491
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

01:29:31.691 --> 01:29:36.062
Good. So, if we go for
it, how would it work?

01:29:36.262 --> 01:29:37.698
I plot the course and execute it.

01:29:37.898 --> 01:29:39.199
Remote override.

01:29:39.399 --> 01:29:40.266
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

01:29:40.466 --> 01:29:42.202
from Mission Control.

01:29:43.037 --> 01:29:45.172
Can you disable it?

01:29:45.372 --> 01:29:47.341
<i>Hermes</i> has four
redundant flight computers...

01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:49.776
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

01:29:49.976 --> 01:29:51.111
We can't shut down the comms

01:29:51.311 --> 01:29:52.646
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

01:29:52.846 --> 01:29:54.381
And we can't shut down the computers

01:29:54.581 --> 01:29:56.316
because we need to run the ship.

01:29:56.516 --> 01:29:59.787
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

01:29:59.987 --> 01:30:01.821
It's part of the OS, I'd
have to jump over the code.

01:30:02.021 --> 01:30:04.992
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:08.228
I can do it.

01:30:08.729 --> 01:30:10.265
Great.

01:30:11.532 --> 01:30:13.401
Well, it has to be unanimous.

01:30:13.934 --> 01:30:18.973
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

01:30:20.907 --> 01:30:24.744
That's more than enough
space for one life...

01:30:24.944 --> 01:30:26.614
so, yes.

01:30:26.814 --> 01:30:28.549
I vote yes.

01:30:30.417 --> 01:30:32.420
Let's go get him.

01:30:34.854 --> 01:30:36.390
Johanssen?

01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:37.857
Yes.

01:30:38.057 --> 01:30:39.225
Yeah!

01:30:41.927 --> 01:30:44.364
Got an unscheduled status
update from <i>Hermes.</i>

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:45.598
Roger. Read it out.

01:30:45.798 --> 01:30:48.468
Message reads, "Houston, please be advised.

01:30:48.668 --> 01:30:50.037
"Rich Purnell is a
steely-eyed missile man."

01:30:50.237 --> 01:30:51.437
What?

01:30:51.637 --> 01:30:52.939
Flight, Guidance.

01:30:53.139 --> 01:30:55.074
<i>Hermes</i> is off-course.

01:30:55.274 --> 01:30:56.310
CAPCOM, advise <i>Hermes</i> they're drifting.

01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:58.177
Guidance, get a correction ready.

01:30:58.377 --> 01:30:59.178
Negative, Flight,

01:30:59.378 --> 01:31:00.780
it's not drift. They've adjusted course.

01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:02.415
What the hell?

01:31:02.615 --> 01:31:05.619
Telemetry, any chance this
is instrumentation failure?

01:31:05.819 --> 01:31:07.354
Negative, Flight.

01:31:07.554 --> 01:31:08.489
Guidance, work at how long they can stay

01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:10.356
on this course before it's irreversible.

01:31:10.556 --> 01:31:12.025
Working on that now, Flight.

01:31:12.225 --> 01:31:13.927
Hey. Who's Rich Purnell?

01:31:14.127 --> 01:31:15.896
I dunno.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:18.632
Will somebody find out who
the hell Rich Purnell is?

01:31:18.832 --> 01:31:20.534
Annie will go before
the media this morning...

01:31:20.734 --> 01:31:22.270
and inform them of NASA's decision

01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:25.204
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

01:31:25.404 --> 01:31:27.441
Sounds like a smart move.

01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:30.910
Considering the circumstances.

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:35.515
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

01:31:35.715 --> 01:31:37.751
Crew made the decision on their own.

01:31:39.319 --> 01:31:41.456
You may have killed them, Mitch.

01:31:43.288 --> 01:31:45.092
We're fighting the same war.

01:31:45.292 --> 01:31:46.427
Every time something goes wrong,

01:31:46.627 --> 01:31:48.294
the world forgets why we fly.

01:31:48.494 --> 01:31:50.064
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

01:31:50.264 --> 01:31:52.466
It's bigger than one person.

01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:55.570
No.

01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:57.205
It's not.

01:31:58.204 --> 01:32:02.109
When this is over, I'll
expect your resignation.

01:32:05.045 --> 01:32:06.347
I understand.

01:32:06.547 --> 01:32:09.350
Bring our astronauts home.

01:32:12.319 --> 01:32:14.922
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

01:32:15.122 --> 01:32:17.591
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

01:32:17.791 --> 01:32:19.025
to send some of the stuff beforehand

01:32:19.225 --> 01:32:20.461
rather than bring it with us.

01:32:20.661 --> 01:32:24.065
So, as a result, the MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

01:32:24.265 --> 01:32:25.432
is already there

01:32:25.632 --> 01:32:27.601
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

01:32:27.801 --> 01:32:31.338
So the plan is for me to
use that to go into orbit...

01:32:31.538 --> 01:32:34.374
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

01:32:34.574 --> 01:32:38.245
and I guess they catch me?

01:32:38.845 --> 01:32:40.814
In space.

01:32:43.783 --> 01:32:46.020
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out...

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:48.855
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...

01:32:49.055 --> 01:32:50.524
the oxygenator, the water reclaimer,

01:32:50.724 --> 01:32:52.525
the atmospheric regulator...

01:32:52.725 --> 01:32:54.762
<i>bring that all with me.</i>

01:32:54.962 --> 01:32:57.129
<i>And luckily, I have the greatest minds</i>

01:32:57.329 --> 01:32:58.698

<i>helping me with this endeavor.</i>

01:33:03.837 --> 01:33:05.472
<i>And so far they've come up with...</i>

01:33:05.672 --> 01:33:06.606
<i>"Hey, why don't you drill holes</i>

01:33:06.806 --> 01:33:08.208

<i>"and hit it as hard as

He would have done the
same for me. You know that.

01:34:25.752 --> 01:34:27.421
Cheese. You do "cheese"?

01:34:27.621 --> 01:34:28.889
Cheese.

01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:31.324
He didn't do "cheese."

01:34:31.524 --> 01:34:33.260
Did he do "cheese"?

01:34:40.833 --> 01:34:41.901
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

<i>Not a scratch.</i>

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:54.280

<i>I've been thinking
about laws on Mars.</i>

01:38:17.717 --> 01:38:18.717
<i>There's an international treaty</i>

01:38:18.917 --> 01:38:20.787
<i>saying no country can lay claim...</i>

01:38:20.987 --> 01:38:22.222
<i>to anything that's not on Earth.</i>

01:38:22.422 --> 01:38:23.556
<i>And by another treaty,</i>

01:38:23.756 --> 01:38:25.458
<i>if you're not in any
country's territory...</i>

01:38:25.658 --> 01:38:26.827
<i>maritime law applies.</i>

01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:30.597
<i>So Mars is international waters.</i>

01:38:30.797 --> 01:38:34.000
<i>Now, NASA is an American
non-military organization.</i>

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.301
<i>It owns the Hab.</i>

01:38:35.501 --> 01:38:37.870
<i>But the second I walk outside,
I'm in international waters.</i>

01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:39.806
<i>So here's the cool part.</i>

01:38:40.006 --> 01:38:41.275
<i>I'm about to leave for
the Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

01:38:41.475 --> 01:38:43.342
where I'm gonna commandeer
the <i>Ares 4</i> lander.

01:38:43.542 --> 01:38:46.613
Nobody explicitly gave me
permission to do this...

01:38:46.813 --> 01:38:49.082
<i>and they can't until
I'm on board the</i> Ares 4.

01:38:49.282 --> 01:38:51.552
<i>So that means I'm gonna
be taking a craft over...</i>

01:38:51.752 --> 01:38:53.854
<i>in international waters
without permission.</i>

01:38:54.054 --> 01:38:58.024
<i>Which, by definition,
makes me a pirate.</i>

01:38:58.757 --> 01:39:02.829
<i>Mark Watney, Space Pirate.</i>

01:39:31.823 --> 01:39:33.960
A Space Pirate.

01:40:34.386 --> 01:40:38.624
<i>Everywhere I go, I'm the first.</i>

01:40:38.824 --> 01:40:41.061
<i>It's a strange feeling.</i>

01:40:41.261 --> 01:40:42.762
<i>Step outside the Rover...</i>

01:40:42.962 --> 01:40:45.163
<i>first guy to be there.</i>

01:40:45.363 --> 01:40:48.869
<i>Climb that hill, first guy to do that.</i>

01:40:49.435 --> 01:40:51.303
<i>Four and a half billion years...</i>

01:40:51.503 --> 01:40:53.472
<i>nobody here.</i>

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:56.876
<i>And now, me.</i>

01:40:57.976 --> 01:41:01.749
<i>I'm the first person to be
alone on an entire planet.</i>

01:41:16.496 --> 01:41:18.364
How's he doing?

01:41:19.533 --> 01:41:21.068
So far, so good.

01:41:21.268 --> 01:41:23.703
He's sticking to schedule.

01:41:23.903 --> 01:41:26.605
Drives for four hours before noon...

01:41:26.805 --> 01:41:28.007
lays the solar panels,

01:41:28.207 --> 01:41:30.142
waits 13 hours for them to recharge...

01:41:30.342 --> 01:41:34.848
and sleeps somewhere in
there and then starts again.

01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:38.051
How's he doing?

01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:43.089
He asked us to call
him Captain Blondebeard.

01:41:44.791 --> 01:41:46.693
Well, technically, Mars
would be under maritime...

01:41:46.893 --> 01:41:48.661
Yeah, I know. He explained it to us.

01:41:50.096 --> 01:41:51.731
Where is he?

01:41:52.564 --> 01:41:53.766
- There.
- Okay.

01:41:53.966 --> 01:41:55.368
Here.

01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:57.037
Okay.

01:43:41.474 --> 01:43:43.375
<i>Okay, I'm gonna start by
stating for the record</i>

01:43:43.575 --> 01:43:44.944
<i>that you're not gonna like this.</i>

01:43:45.144 --> 01:43:46.780
Oh, yeah?

01:43:47.247 --> 01:43:49.650
Yeah, the problem is
the intercept velocity.

01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:54.553
The <i>Hermes,</i> well...
It can't enter Mars' orbit.

01:43:54.753 --> 01:43:57.923
Otherwise, they'll never have
enough fuel to make it home.

01:43:58.123 --> 01:43:59.958
The MAV, that was only designed

01:44:00.158 --> 01:44:02.628
to get to low Mars orbit.

01:44:02.828 --> 01:44:06.732
So in order for Mark to escape
Mars' gravity entirely...

01:44:06.932 --> 01:44:08.301
and to intercept the <i>Hermes...</i>

01:44:08.501 --> 01:44:10.302
- He has to be going fast.
- Exactly.

01:44:10.502 --> 01:44:12.506
<i>Which means we need to
make the MAV lighter.</i>

01:44:12.706 --> 01:44:15.174
<i>A lot lighter. 5,000 kilograms lighter.</i>

01:44:15.374 --> 01:44:16.609
You can do that, right?

01:44:16.809 --> 01:44:18.543
<i>There's some gimmes right off the bat.</i>

01:44:18.743 --> 01:44:20.146
<i>The design presumes 500 kilograms</i>

01:44:20.346 --> 01:44:21.815
<i>of Martian soil and samples.</i>

01:44:22.015 --> 01:44:23.615
Obviously we won't do that.

01:44:23.815 --> 01:44:27.454
And there's just one
passenger instead of six.

01:44:27.654 --> 01:44:30.190
With suits and gear, that's another 500?

01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:32.458
Ditch the life support, don't need it.

01:44:32.658 --> 01:44:34.293
And we'll get Mark to wear
his EVA suit the whole trip.

01:44:34.493 --> 01:44:36.029
Wait a second. If he's in his EVA suit,

01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:37.364
how is he gonna operate the controls?

01:44:37.564 --> 01:44:39.798
Well, he won't.

01:44:39.998 --> 01:44:43.668
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the <i>Hermes.</i>

01:44:43.868 --> 01:44:46.773
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.

01:44:47.939 --> 01:44:50.110
But I am excited about

01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:52.445
the opportunities that affords.

01:44:52.645 --> 01:44:54.913
If we go remote, we can
lose the control panels,

01:44:55.113 --> 01:44:56.716
the secondary and tertiary comm systems.

01:44:56.916 --> 01:44:58.016
<i>Wait a second.</i>

01:44:58.216 --> 01:45:02.288
<i>You want a remote-controlled
ascent with no backup comms?</i>

01:45:04.323 --> 01:45:06.760
He's not even got to the
bad stuff yet, Vincent.

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.427
Let's skip to the bad stuff!

01:45:08.627 --> 01:45:10.262
We need to remove the nose airlock,

01:45:10.462 --> 01:45:13.566
the windows, and Hull Panel 19.

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:16.034
You want to take the front of the ship off?

01:45:16.234 --> 01:45:17.602
<i>Sure.</i>

01:45:17.802 --> 01:45:20.506
<i>The nose airlock alone
is 400 kilograms.</i>

01:45:20.706 --> 01:45:21.873
You want to send a man into space

01:45:22.073 --> 01:45:22.875
without the front of his ship?

01:45:23.075 --> 01:45:24.812
<i>Well, no.</i>

01:45:25.578 --> 01:45:28.949
<i>We're gonna have him
cover it with Hab canvas.</i>

01:45:29.548 --> 01:45:32.952
<i>Look, the hull's mostly
there to keep the air in.</i>

01:45:33.152 --> 01:45:34.520
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.321
you don't need a lot of streamlining.

01:45:36.521 --> 01:45:37.856
By the time the ship's going fast enough

01:45:38.056 --> 01:45:39.659
for air resistance to matter...

01:45:39.859 --> 01:45:42.294
it'll be high enough that
there's practically no air.

01:45:42.494 --> 01:45:44.730
You wanna send him into space under a tarp.

01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:46.966
<i>Yes.</i>

01:45:47.166 --> 01:45:48.767
<i>Can I go on?</i>

01:45:48.967 --> 01:45:50.536
No.

01:45:56.542 --> 01:45:58.977
You think he means it like...

01:45:59.177 --> 01:46:00.980
"Are you kidding me?"

01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.414
- You know?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:46:02.614 --> 01:46:06.152
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"

01:46:06.618 --> 01:46:08.120
I think it might be the second one.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.821
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

01:46:10.021 --> 01:46:12.091
Could be the first way.

01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:13.961
"Are you kidding me?"

01:46:14.493 --> 01:46:16.530
Yeah, it could be the first way.

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.388
<i>I know what they're doing.</i>

01:46:43.588 --> 01:46:46.092
I know exactly what they're doing.

01:46:46.292 --> 01:46:48.328
They just keep repeating...

01:46:48.528 --> 01:46:51.297
"Go faster than any man in
the history of space travel."

01:46:51.497 --> 01:46:52.731
<i>Like that's a good thing.</i>

01:46:52.931 --> 01:46:55.369
<i>Like it'll distract me from
how insane their plan is.</i>

01:46:56.569 --> 01:46:58.003
Yeah, I get to go faster than any man

01:46:58.203 --> 01:47:00.205
in the history of space travel...

01:47:00.405 --> 01:47:03.042
because you are launching
me in a convertible.

01:47:03.242 --> 01:47:04.843
Actually it's worse than that

01:47:05.043 --> 01:47:06.879
because I won't even be
able to control the thing.

01:47:07.079 --> 01:47:09.681
<i>And by the way, physicists,</i>

01:47:09.881 --> 01:47:12.452
<i>when describing things
like acceleration...</i>

01:47:12.652 --> 01:47:15.155
<i>do not use the word "fast."</i>

01:47:15.721 --> 01:47:17.656
So they're only doing that in the hopes

01:47:17.856 --> 01:47:20.359
that I won't raise any objections...

01:47:20.926 --> 01:47:23.429
to this lunacy.

01:47:23.962 --> 01:47:25.565
<i>Because I like the way</i>

01:47:25.765 --> 01:47:28.936
<i>"fastest man in the history
of space travel" sounds.</i>

01:47:30.302 --> 01:47:32.606
<i>I do like the way it sounds.</i>

01:47:33.372 --> 01:47:35.608
<i>I mean, I like it a lot.</i>

01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:40.280
<i>I'm not gonna tell them that.</i>

01:47:45.883 --> 01:47:47.387
<i>Okay.</i>

01:47:48.454 --> 01:47:50.590

01:50:25.110 --> 01:50:26.878
<i>- before the MAV even launches.
- Okay.</i>

01:50:27.078 --> 01:50:30.583
<i>Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysops the ascent.</i>

01:50:30.783 --> 01:50:32.517
<i>Once we hit intercept,</i>

01:50:32.717 --> 01:50:34.453
<i>it's Beck's job to go get Watney.</i>

01:50:34.653 --> 01:50:35.654
We're ready.

01:50:35.854 --> 01:50:37.491
What's the intercept plan?

01:50:38.157 --> 01:50:40.292
We finished attaching the
tethers into one long line.

01:50:40.492 --> 01:50:42.395
It's 214 meters long.

01:50:42.595 --> 01:50:43.663
And I'll have the MMU,

01:50:43.863 --> 01:50:45.431
so moving around should be easy.

01:50:45.631 --> 01:50:47.666
How fast a relative
velocity can you handle?

01:50:48.533 --> 01:50:50.903
I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second.

01:50:51.103 --> 01:50:53.338
10 is like jumping onto a moving train.

01:50:53.538 --> 01:50:55.306
So any more than that and I might miss.

01:50:55.506 --> 01:50:57.643
Well, we may have some leeway.

01:50:58.844 --> 01:51:00.713
The launch takes 12 minutes.

01:51:00.913 --> 01:51:04.217
And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

01:51:04.417 --> 01:51:06.686
Once Mark's engine shuts off...

01:51:06.886 --> 01:51:09.187
we'll know our intercept
point and velocity.

01:51:09.387 --> 01:51:11.024
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

01:51:11.224 --> 01:51:13.726
Everything goes well, you pull
them on board with the tether.

01:51:13.926 --> 01:51:16.396
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.

01:51:16.596 --> 01:51:17.730
Yep.

01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:19.365
Okay.

01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:23.803
Let's go get our boy.

01:52:24.896 --> 01:52:26.597
There's a mood
of tension and anxiety here,

01:52:26.797 --> 01:52:28.100
outside Johnson Space Center.

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.369
As you can see,

01:52:29.569 --> 01:52:30.668
many people have gathered here...

01:52:30.868 --> 01:52:32.037
to see whether or not

01:52:32.237 --> 01:52:36.275
the mission to retrieve Mark
Watney will be a success.

01:52:36.475 --> 01:52:38.110
<i>They've had some contact with him,</i>

01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:40.146
<i>but it hasn't been very much.</i>

01:52:40.346 --> 01:52:41.513
<i>We have to remind our viewers</i>

01:52:41.713 --> 01:52:43.414
<i>that we're watching this as it unfolds.</i>

01:52:43.614 --> 01:52:45.351
<i>So we'll try and keep you up-to-date</i>

01:52:45.551 --> 01:52:47.320
<i>as to what exactly is going on.</i>

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:51.022
<i>Let's listen in to NASA making
contact with Mark Watney.</i>

01:52:51.222 --> 01:52:52.791
<i>Let's listen in.</i>

01:52:59.297 --> 01:53:01.533
If something goes wrong,
what can Mission Control do?

01:53:01.733 --> 01:53:04.537
Not a damn thing.

01:53:04.737 --> 01:53:06.506
It's all happening 12
light-minutes away...

01:53:06.706 --> 01:53:08.106
which means it takes 24 minutes for them

01:53:08.306 --> 01:53:10.576
to get the answer to any question they ask.

01:53:11.409 --> 01:53:13.713
The whole launch is 12 minutes...

01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:16.983
so they're on their own.

01:54:22.113 --> 01:54:22.781
<i>...just how
long Mark has been</i>

01:54:22.981 --> 01:54:24.182
<i>completely alone on Mars.</i>

01:54:24.382 --> 01:54:27.553
<i>We're talking to a psychology
expert later to discuss...</i>

01:54:50.042 --> 01:54:51.610
<i>Fuel pressure, green.</i>

01:54:51.810 --> 01:54:53.945
Engine alignment, perfect.

01:54:54.145 --> 01:54:55.814
<i>Communications, five by five.</i>

01:54:57.381 --> 01:55:00.119
<i>We are ready for pre-flight
checklist, Commander.</i>

01:55:00.319 --> 01:55:02.655
<i>Mission Control, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

01:55:02.855 --> 01:55:04.958
<i>We will proceed on schedule.</i>

01:55:05.158 --> 01:55:06.792
<i>We are T-minus 2 minutes, 10 seconds</i>

01:55:06.992 --> 01:55:08.862
<i>to launch, by the mark.</i>

01:55:09.761 --> 01:55:10.730
About two minutes, Watney.

01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:11.964
<i>How you doing down there?</i>

01:55:12.164 --> 01:55:13.931
I'm good.

01:55:14.131 --> 01:55:16.400
I'm anxious to get up to you.

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:17.770
Thanks for coming back for me.

01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:19.105
<i>Well, we're on it.</i>

01:55:19.305 --> 01:55:20.739
<i>Remember, you'll be
pulling some serious G's,</i>

01:55:20.939 --> 01:55:22.641
<i>so it's okay to pass out.</i>

01:55:22.841 --> 01:55:25.043
You're in Martinez's hands now.

01:55:25.610 --> 01:55:27.413
Well, tell that asshole no barrel rolls.

01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:30.348
Copy that, MAV.

01:55:30.548 --> 01:55:31.516
<i>CAPCOM.</i>

01:55:31.716 --> 01:55:32.718
<i>Go.</i>

01:55:32.918 --> 01:55:33.651
<i>Remote command.</i>

01:55:33.851 --> 01:55:34.686
<i>Go.</i>

01:55:34.886 --> 01:55:35.754
<i>Recovery.</i>

01:55:35.954 --> 01:55:36.954
<i>Go.</i>

01:55:37.154 --> 01:55:38.423
<i>Secondary recovery.</i>

01:55:38.623 --> 01:55:39.424
<i>Go.</i>

01:55:39.624 --> 01:55:41.126
Pilot.

01:55:42.094 --> 01:55:43.095
Go.

01:55:43.295 --> 01:55:44.530
<i>Pilot.</i>

01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:45.963
<i>Go.</i>

01:55:46.163 --> 01:55:48.044
<i>Copy. We're go.</i>

01:55:48.266 --> 01:55:50.870
<i>Mission Control,
we are go for launch.</i>

01:55:51.304 --> 01:55:52.303
T-minus ten...

01:55:52.503 --> 01:55:53.472
nine...

01:55:53.672 --> 01:55:54.640
Main engine start.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:56.107
<i>Eight...</i>

01:55:56.307 --> 01:55:57.375
<i>seven...</i>

01:55:57.575 --> 01:55:59.177
<i>Mooring clamps released.</i>

01:55:59.377 --> 01:56:00.913
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.

01:56:01.113 --> 01:56:02.781
I'll see you in a few, Commander.

01:56:02.981 --> 01:56:04.415
<i>Four...</i>

01:56:04.615 --> 01:56:06.083
<i>three...</i>

01:56:06.283 --> 01:56:07.552
<i>two...</i>

01:56:07.752 --> 01:56:09.456
<i>one.</i>

01:56:45.323 --> 01:56:47.560
Velocity, 741 meters per second.

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.628
Altitude, 1350 meters.

01:56:49.828 --> 01:56:50.930
That's too low.

01:56:51.130 --> 01:56:52.799
It's fighting me.

01:56:56.368 --> 01:56:59.538
<i>Watney, do you read?</i>

01:57:05.578 --> 01:57:06.811
<i>Booster separation complete.</i>

01:57:07.011 --> 01:57:09.949
Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1843.

01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:11.284
He's well below target altitude.

01:57:11.484 --> 01:57:12.952
How far below?

01:57:13.152 --> 01:57:14.552
Checking.

01:57:14.752 --> 01:57:16.489
Watney.

01:57:16.689 --> 01:57:17.989
Do you read?

01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:19.290
<i>He's probably passed out.</i>

01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:20.525
<i>He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.</i>

01:57:20.725 --> 01:57:21.860
<i>Give him a few minutes.</i>

01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.730
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:57:25.831 --> 01:57:27.399
<i>Main shutdown in three...</i>

01:57:27.599 --> 01:57:29.635
<i>two, one...</i>

01:57:29.835 --> 01:57:31.304
<i>shutdown.</i>

01:57:32.637 --> 01:57:34.540
<i>Back to automatic guidance.</i>

01:57:34.972 --> 01:57:36.776
<i>Shutdown confirmed.</i>

01:57:38.844 --> 01:57:40.979
<i>Fuel reserves depleted.</i>

01:57:42.514 --> 01:57:43.882
<i>Watney?</i>

01:57:44.082 --> 01:57:45.884
<i>Do you read?</i>

01:57:46.518 --> 01:57:47.552
<i>It seems there's some sort of problem</i>

01:57:47.752 --> 01:57:49.688
<i>with the transmission.</i>

01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:58.097
<i>I have interval pings.</i>

01:57:58.297 --> 01:57:59.931
Intercept velocity will
be 11 meters per second.

01:58:00.131 --> 01:58:02.301
I can make that work.

01:58:02.835 --> 01:58:05.137
Distance at intercept will be...

01:58:05.337 --> 01:58:07.373
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

01:58:07.573 --> 01:58:09.475
<i>68 kilometers?</i>

01:58:09.675 --> 01:58:12.312
<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

01:58:12.944 --> 01:58:13.611
Come on, guys, keep it together.

01:58:13.811 --> 01:58:15.214
Work the problem.

01:58:15.646 --> 01:58:17.815
Johanssen, time to intercept?

01:58:18.015 --> 01:58:20.186
<i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

01:58:20.618 --> 01:58:21.820
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:23.622
in the same direction?

01:58:23.822 --> 01:58:26.892
Well, it depends how much
fuel you wanna save...

01:58:27.092 --> 01:58:28.025
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

01:58:28.225 --> 01:58:29.427
How much do you need?

01:58:29.627 --> 01:58:34.199
I can get by with about
20% of what we have left.

01:58:35.167 --> 01:58:38.236
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

01:58:38.436 --> 01:58:40.105
that will bring the
intercept range to zero.

01:58:40.305 --> 01:58:41.773
Do it.

01:58:42.307 --> 01:58:45.511
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

01:58:45.711 --> 01:58:48.113
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

01:58:48.313 --> 01:58:50.382
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

01:58:50.582 --> 01:58:52.383
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

01:58:52.583 --> 01:58:54.387
how to slow down.

01:58:57.122 --> 01:58:58.824
Martinez, burn the jets.

01:58:59.024 --> 01:59:00.893
Copy that.

01:59:22.847 --> 01:59:24.749
MAV to <i>Hermes.</i>

01:59:24.949 --> 01:59:25.917
<i>Watney?</i>

01:59:26.117 --> 01:59:27.118
<i>Affirmative.</i>

01:59:31.222 --> 01:59:32.790
<i>What's your status?</i>

01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:34.760
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:36.928
<i>I broke my ribs.</i>

01:59:37.128 --> 01:59:38.363
<i>How are you?</i>

01:59:38.563 --> 01:59:39.464
<i>We're working on getting to you.</i>

01:59:39.664 --> 01:59:40.967
<i>There was a complication during launch.</i>

01:59:41.167 --> 01:59:42.901
Copy that.

01:59:43.101 --> 01:59:44.936
How bad is it?

01:59:45.136 --> 01:59:46.439
<i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

01:59:46.639 --> 01:59:48.574
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

01:59:48.774 --> 01:59:49.842
<i>How big a problem?</i>

01:59:50.042 --> 01:59:51.610
42 meters a second.

01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:53.312
Well...

01:59:54.046 --> 01:59:56.115
shit.

02:00:00.786 --> 02:00:02.488
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

02:00:02.688 --> 02:00:04.222
<i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

02:00:04.422 --> 02:00:07.458
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

02:00:07.658 --> 02:00:10.463
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit...

02:00:10.663 --> 02:00:12.931
I could use the escaping
air as a thruster...

02:00:13.131 --> 02:00:14.665
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

02:00:14.865 --> 02:00:18.136
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

02:00:18.336 --> 02:00:19.972
I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

02:00:20.172 --> 02:00:21.906
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

02:00:22.106 --> 02:00:24.342
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

02:00:24.542 --> 02:00:28.079
Yes, those are all very good points.

02:00:28.279 --> 02:00:31.450
But consider this.

02:00:33.318 --> 02:00:35.953
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

02:00:37.122 --> 02:00:38.722
<i>Commander...</i>

02:00:38.922 --> 02:00:40.992
<i>let's go Iron Man.</i>

02:00:43.694 --> 02:00:45.196
<i>This is unexpected LOS.</i>

02:00:45.396 --> 02:00:47.477
<i>Communication lost. Stand by.</i>

02:00:48.132 --> 02:00:50.802
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

02:00:51.002 --> 02:00:52.671
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

02:00:52.871 --> 02:00:53.972
Not what he said.

02:00:54.172 --> 02:00:56.776
Using atmosphere as thrust.

02:00:58.577 --> 02:01:00.579
What happens if we blow the VAL?

02:01:00.779 --> 02:01:02.614
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

02:01:02.814 --> 02:01:03.949
It'll give us a good kick.

02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:06.017
But also blow the nose off the ship.

02:01:06.217 --> 02:01:08.921
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

02:01:09.121 --> 02:01:11.156
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

02:01:11.356 --> 02:01:12.790
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:14.092
Vogel.

02:01:14.292 --> 02:01:15.994
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

02:01:16.194 --> 02:01:19.030
I need you to come
inside and make a... bomb.

02:01:19.230 --> 02:01:20.132
Again, Commander?

02:01:20.332 --> 02:01:21.433
<i>You're a chemist.</i>

02:01:21.633 --> 02:01:23.803
<i>Can you make a bomb with
what you have on board?</i>

02:01:24.903 --> 02:01:26.773
Probably.

02:01:27.337 --> 02:01:28.573
But I feel obliged to mention

02:01:28.773 --> 02:01:30.609
that setting off an explosive device...

02:01:30.809 --> 02:01:33.579
<i>in a spacecraft is a
terrible, terrible idea.</i>

02:01:33.779 --> 02:01:36.681
Hang on. You guys making a bomb without me?

02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:39.217
<i>Copy that. Can you do it?</i>

02:01:41.052 --> 02:01:42.554
<i>Ja.</i>

02:01:45.224 --> 02:01:46.958
<i>Houston, be advised.</i>

02:01:47.158 --> 02:01:48.226
<i>We are going to
deliberately breach the VAL</i>

02:01:48.426 --> 02:01:50.363
<i>to produce a reverse thrust.</i>

02:01:51.462 --> 02:01:53.665
Beck, leave your suit on.
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.

02:01:53.865 --> 02:01:55.066
We'll open the outer door.

02:01:55.266 --> 02:01:57.136
<i>I need you to place the
charge on the inner door.</i>

02:01:57.336 --> 02:01:59.169
<i>Climb back to Airlock 2 along the hull.</i>

02:01:59.369 --> 02:02:01.573
Copy. I'm on my way.

02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:09.948
I'm in, Commander.

02:02:10.148 --> 02:02:11.517
<i>Copy that.</i>

02:02:20.292 --> 02:02:21.993
Vogel, where are you?

02:02:22.193 --> 02:02:22.927
<i>I'm in the kitchen.</i>

02:02:23.127 --> 02:02:24.830
Okay.

02:02:28.298 --> 02:02:29.368
<i>Commander...</i>

02:02:29.568 --> 02:02:31.302
I can't let you go through with this.

02:02:31.502 --> 02:02:33.071
I am prepared to cut the suit.

02:02:33.271 --> 02:02:34.605
Absolutely not.

02:02:34.805 --> 02:02:37.308
<i>See, the thing is, I'm selfish.</i>

02:02:37.508 --> 02:02:39.878
I want all the memorials
back home to be about me.

02:02:40.078 --> 02:02:41.245
<i>Just me.</i>

02:02:41.445 --> 02:02:43.647
I should have left this guy on Mars.

02:02:43.847 --> 02:02:45.350
Hey.

02:02:47.752 --> 02:02:48.620
Sugar?

02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:50.322
Yeah.

02:02:54.024 --> 02:02:55.860
Can you hold this?

02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:57.997
Liquid oxygen...

02:02:58.197 --> 02:03:01.934
and some stain remover
that contains ammonia.

02:03:05.136 --> 02:03:08.207
This thing here is five times stronger

02:03:08.407 --> 02:03:09.674
than a stick of dynamite.

02:03:09.874 --> 02:03:11.276
How do we activate it?

02:03:11.476 --> 02:03:14.379
Can you connect this to
one of our lighting panels?

02:03:17.381 --> 02:03:19.251
Careful.

02:03:25.355 --> 02:03:27.292
Open Airlock 1.

02:03:32.797 --> 02:03:34.358
I'm on the way to Beck.

02:03:38.403 --> 02:03:39.805
Let's just hope this is a good idea, guys.

02:03:40.005 --> 02:03:41.071
It is.

02:03:41.271 --> 02:03:42.974
<i>Open A1.</i>

02:03:47.813 --> 02:03:49.247
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:03:52.417 --> 02:03:54.420
- You got it?
- Mmm.

02:03:59.858 --> 02:04:02.628
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.

02:04:03.962 --> 02:04:05.196
Hey.

02:04:05.396 --> 02:04:07.098
Be careful out there.

02:04:07.298 --> 02:04:09.100
In space.

02:04:12.703 --> 02:04:15.473
Don't tell anyone I did that.

02:04:25.048 --> 02:04:26.419
Bomb set.

02:04:34.825 --> 02:04:37.530
Leaving Airlock 1.

02:04:42.266 --> 02:04:43.235
Guys, I'm running the numbers,

02:04:43.435 --> 02:04:44.570
and even with optimal VAL blow...

02:04:44.770 --> 02:04:46.503
we're gonna be off on our angle.

02:04:46.703 --> 02:04:49.274
What's the intercept distance? Johanssen?

02:04:49.474 --> 02:04:51.744
260 meters, approximate.

02:04:51.944 --> 02:04:53.612
That's too far.

02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:03.488
Commander?

02:05:03.688 --> 02:05:06.091
Martinez, close the door.

02:05:08.993 --> 02:05:10.796
Open D3.

02:05:10.996 --> 02:05:13.232
And leave it open.

02:05:41.359 --> 02:05:43.529
<i>Open B2.</i>

02:05:47.265 --> 02:05:48.600
Johanssen...

02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.003
<i>time to VAL blow after initiate?</i>

02:05:51.203 --> 02:05:52.570
15 seconds.

02:05:52.770 --> 02:05:55.274
We sure know how to cut it close.

02:05:55.474 --> 02:05:56.540
Commander?

02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:59.011
Distance is too far. I'm going out.

02:05:59.211 --> 02:06:00.145
I can do this.

02:06:00.345 --> 02:06:01.512
It's not a debate.

02:06:01.712 --> 02:06:03.248
I'm not risking another crew member.

02:06:03.448 --> 02:06:05.083
Beck's returned.

02:06:05.283 --> 02:06:07.052
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

02:06:07.252 --> 02:06:08.285
Ten seconds.

02:06:08.485 --> 02:06:10.321
Strap in.

02:06:10.521 --> 02:06:12.824
<i>Five, four...</i>

02:06:13.024 --> 02:06:14.258
three...

02:06:14.458 --> 02:06:16.127
- Brace for deceleration.
<i>two...</i>

02:06:16.327 --> 02:06:17.361
one.

02:06:17.561 --> 02:06:19.365
Activating Panel 41.

02:06:41.051 --> 02:06:42.119
Bridge seal holding.

02:06:42.319 --> 02:06:43.454
What's the damage?

02:06:43.654 --> 02:06:44.655
<i>Worry about that later.</i>

02:06:44.855 --> 02:06:46.356
<i>What's the relative velocity?</i>

02:06:46.556 --> 02:06:47.891
12 meters per second.

02:06:48.091 --> 02:06:50.493
<i>Copy.</i>

02:06:51.529 --> 02:06:53.164
Hook me up.

02:06:54.332 --> 02:06:56.135
Done.

02:07:05.577 --> 02:07:07.680
I have visual on the MAV.

02:07:08.679 --> 02:07:10.414
<i>What's the intercept range?</i>

02:07:10.614 --> 02:07:12.450
I'm checking.

02:07:12.650 --> 02:07:14.153
312 meters.

02:07:14.353 --> 02:07:16.820
Did you say 312?

02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:19.791
Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.

02:07:22.961 --> 02:07:24.363
Oh!

02:07:28.765 --> 02:07:30.534
I can't get to you, Mark. You're too far.

02:07:30.734 --> 02:07:31.669
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

02:07:31.869 --> 02:07:32.904
I know.

02:07:33.104 --> 02:07:34.839
<i>Beck, unhook me.
I'm going after him.</i>

02:07:35.039 --> 02:07:37.809
Commander, I got this.

02:07:51.323 --> 02:07:53.056
Mark, report.

02:07:53.256 --> 02:07:54.859
On my way, Commander.

02:07:55.059 --> 02:07:56.860
Damn it.

02:08:06.203 --> 02:08:08.339
Johanssen, what's my
relative velocity to Mark?

02:08:08.539 --> 02:08:10.374
5.2 meters per second.

02:08:10.574 --> 02:08:12.577
Copy. Adjusting course.

02:08:18.015 --> 02:08:20.186
<i>3.1 meters per second.</i>

02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:24.790
<i>Distance to target, 24 meters.</i>

02:08:26.323 --> 02:08:28.561
11 meters to target.

02:08:31.061 --> 02:08:32.464
<i>Six meters.</i>

02:08:42.274 --> 02:08:44.910
Hold on, Mark.

02:09:12.471 --> 02:09:13.570
I got him.

02:09:16.608 --> 02:09:18.375
<i>I got him.</i>

02:09:18.575 --> 02:09:19.977
<i>I got him.</i>

02:09:20.177 --> 02:09:21.981
Way to go, Iron Man.

02:09:24.716 --> 02:09:26.484
Beck, pull us in.

02:09:29.387 --> 02:09:31.256
It's good to see you.

02:09:32.457 --> 02:09:33.993
You...

02:09:35.525 --> 02:09:39.597
have terrible taste in music.

02:09:48.806 --> 02:09:50.374
<i>Houston, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

02:09:50.574 --> 02:09:51.710
<i>We got him.</i>

02:09:53.677 --> 02:09:55.313
<i>Watney is secure.</i>

02:10:00.518 --> 02:10:02.553
Contact in
outer space with Mark Watney.

02:10:02.753 --> 02:10:04.655
<i>After a very long time, they have done</i>

02:10:04.855 --> 02:10:06.824
<i>what many people
thought was impossible.</i>

02:10:07.024 --> 02:10:08.125
<i>Mission confirmation:</i>

02:10:08.325 --> 02:10:11.028
<i>Mark Watney has been
successfully rescued.</i>

02:10:14.631 --> 02:10:16.634
Grab a hold of him.

02:10:18.202 --> 02:10:19.404
Hey, handsome!

02:10:19.604 --> 02:10:21.640
Beck, close the hatch.

02:10:24.374 --> 02:10:26.077
Hey, guys!

02:10:30.582 --> 02:10:32.951
<i>Houston, six crew safely aboard.</i>

02:10:37.255 --> 02:10:40.257
<i>This is huge moment for this
nation, for the world...</i>

02:10:40.457 --> 02:10:43.727
<i>and indeed, for
international space travel.</i>

02:10:43.927 --> 02:10:46.131
I can't believe
anything you do works.

02:10:46.331 --> 02:10:47.965
Hey!

02:10:49.633 --> 02:10:50.668
Oh, God.

02:10:50.868 --> 02:10:52.838
I can't believe it.

02:10:53.938 --> 02:10:55.272
There's a little smell
going on over there, bud.

02:10:55.472 --> 02:10:59.043
I know. I haven't had a
shower in a year and a half.

02:10:59.243 --> 02:11:01.847
Don't make me laugh, I have broken ribs.

02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:37.049
Hey, there.

02:11:45.288 --> 02:11:47.091
- Morning, sir.
- It's an honor, sir.

02:11:47.291 --> 02:11:48.994
Sir.

02:11:49.194 --> 02:11:50.794
- Sir.
- Sir.

02:11:50.994 --> 02:11:52.630
Morning, sir.

02:12:14.418 --> 02:12:16.687
<i>Welcome to the
Astronaut Candidate Program.</i>

02:12:16.887 --> 02:12:18.756
Now pay attention,

02:12:18.956 --> 02:12:20.891
because this could save your life.

02:12:21.091 --> 02:12:22.692
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

02:12:24.127 --> 02:12:26.030
Let me get a few things out
of the way, right off the bat.

02:12:26.230 --> 02:12:29.568
Yes, I did in fact survive
on a deserted planet

02:12:29.768 --> 02:12:32.137
by farming in my own shit.

02:12:33.104 --> 02:12:35.539
Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds.

02:12:35.739 --> 02:12:37.742
So let's not talk about that ever again.

02:12:38.943 --> 02:12:41.812
The other question I
get most frequently is...

02:12:42.012 --> 02:12:44.548
"When I was up there, stranded by myself...

02:12:44.748 --> 02:12:47.185
"did I think I was going to die?"

02:12:47.385 --> 02:12:49.220
Yes, absolutely.

02:12:50.255 --> 02:12:51.455
And that's what you need to know going in

02:12:51.655 --> 02:12:53.524
because it's going to happen to you.

02:12:53.724 --> 02:12:57.294
This is space. It does not cooperate.

02:12:57.494 --> 02:12:59.963
At some point, everything
is going to go south on you.

02:13:00.163 --> 02:13:01.266
Everything is going to go south

02:13:01.466 --> 02:13:02.900
and you're going to say, "This is it.

02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:05.170
"This is how I end."

02:13:06.203 --> 02:13:08.172
Now, you can either accept that...

02:13:08.372 --> 02:13:10.741
or you can get to work.

02:13:11.408 --> 02:13:13.044
That's all it is.

02:13:13.244 --> 02:13:15.546
You just begin.

02:13:16.012 --> 02:13:18.850
You do the math. You solve one problem...

02:13:19.050 --> 02:13:20.551
then you solve the next one.

02:13:20.751 --> 02:13:21.820
And then the next.

02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:22.854
And if you solve enough problems,

02:13:23.054 --> 02:13:25.122
you get to come home.

02:13:25.555 --> 02:13:27.959
All right, questions?

02:13:32.963 --> 02:13:33.931
<i>Once Mission Control completes</i>

02:13:34.131 --> 02:13:35.065
<i>their pre-flight checks...</i>

02:13:35.265 --> 02:13:37.435
<i>we'll begin launch procedures.</i>

02:13:37.635 --> 02:13:39.904
<i>The</i> Ares 5 <i>team will
rendezvous with the</i> Hermes...

02:13:40.104 --> 02:13:43.107
approximately 48 minutes after launch.

02:13:43.307 --> 02:13:45.109
From there, they will have 414 days

02:13:45.309 --> 02:13:47.144
of space travel ahead of them.

02:13:47.344 --> 02:13:48.413
<i>Have the goals changed</i>

02:13:48.613 --> 02:13:49.913
<i>from the previous mission...</i>

02:13:50.113 --> 02:13:51.548
<i>to the</i> Ares 5 <i>program?</i>

02:13:51.748 --> 02:13:53.584
<i>And what do you hope to
achieve this time around?</i>

02:13:53.784 --> 02:13:55.319
<i>Well, no. The goals
have always been the same</i>

02:13:55.519 --> 02:13:57.222
for the <i>Ares</i> program.

02:13:57.956 --> 02:13:59.156
This time, of course, we hope to bring

02:13:59.356 --> 02:14:00.997
all the astronauts back at the same time.

02:14:01.958 --> 02:14:02.627
Flight, Guidance check complete.

02:14:02.827 --> 02:14:04.196
Copy, Guidance.

02:14:05.297 --> 02:14:06.730
This is Flight.

02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:08.966
We are go for launch, on schedule.

02:14:19.609 --> 02:14:20.543
<i>Final aerosurface</i>

02:14:20.743 --> 02:14:22.113
<i>checks are complete...</i>

02:14:22.313 --> 02:14:25.449
<i>as everything remains a go
for the launch of the</i> Ares 5.

02:14:25.649 --> 02:14:27.251
<i>20 seconds.</i>

02:14:28.552 --> 02:14:29.887
<i>Proceeding with the count.</i>

<i>And liftoff.

02:14:49.573 --> 02:14:50.742
<i>Pressures look good.</i>

02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:10.962
Wow. Good shot.

02:15:11.162 --> 02:15:12.262
<i>There you have it.</i>

02:15:12.462 --> 02:15:14.699
