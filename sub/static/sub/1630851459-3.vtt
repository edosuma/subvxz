WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:04.370
Oh, and the board needs
a slogan by end of day.

00:04.505 --> 00:07.439
Yeah, on it. Just haven't quite
landed on the perfect one.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.673
I asked you three weeks ago.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.309
But I want it to
be really great.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.177
Something that crystalizes
what this place is about.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.812
Most people won't read it.

00:13.947 --> 00:14.946
Okay. What about,

00:15.016 --> 00:17.049
"hamilton east
animal shelter.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.450
We love animals."

00:18.486 --> 00:19.585
Okay.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.086
Too basic. So basic!

00:21.088 --> 00:22.588
This one's better,
"help! I'm a homeless animal

00:22.723 --> 00:25.257
And I need a home
because I don't have one."

00:25.392 --> 00:27.326
Bit long and explain-y.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.661
I also cut out some
inspirational words.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.129
"we have your next pet."

00:31.165 --> 00:32.931
More of a ransom feel.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.800
Right.
Is that a pro or a con?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.001
Don't overthink it, okay?

00:36.136 --> 00:37.335
Just something simple
and brilliant that

00:37.371 --> 00:39.004
Instantly captures
peoples' hearts and minds.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.808
Matching hearts,
finding homes.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.176
No one needs to be alone.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.445
Wait, what was that?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.547
What did you say?
I don't know. Write it down!

00:48.549 --> 00:49.882
Oh my god! Where's a pen?!

00:49.884 --> 00:51.416
Was it, uh...
Finding hearts?

00:51.485 --> 00:52.918
Homey homes? Home alone?

00:52.987 --> 00:54.486
Stop saying words
when they're not right!

00:54.522 --> 00:56.255
Uh! It was perfect.
Why are these always empty?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.823
This isn't my phone!

00:57.825 --> 00:59.691
Okay, go.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.261
Nope, it's gone.

01:04.932 --> 01:06.899
Okay, let's go
with the ransom note.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.834
Good!

Liam:
You've done wonders
with the place.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.388
Welcome to the building, ross!

01:29.523 --> 01:30.455
Liam, hugh!

01:30.524 --> 01:32.457
Glasses are there.
Let's pop it off.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.059
No, no.
That's for you.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.128
Hugh's got a lot of work to do.
Right, hon?

01:36.197 --> 01:38.497
Oh, yeah... I guess.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.399
Aw, that's too bad.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.868
You know what? I don't even
know what you do, mr. Mystery.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.569
Well, I'm trained
as a dental hygienist,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.738
But my passion is candle making.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.406
And mine's butter churning.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.842
He's not joking.

01:49.977 --> 01:53.078
No, my latest is a honey jasmine
with soy wax and arnica oil.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.380
It's kind of part of my, uh,
'back to basics' line.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.549
Love it, and do you mix
them yourself, or...

01:57.585 --> 01:58.550
Ooh. Trade secret.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.084
In the bathtub.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.721
Question, do you have any
that smell like a hotel pool?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.623
'kay, we're gonna
time out here, ross.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.625
Oh, no. Uh, at work I'm ross,

02:06.694 --> 02:08.360
But here I'm shannon, or shans.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.561
Nikki called me shannonna once

02:09.696 --> 02:11.363
But, to be fair,
she was mid-yawn.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.764
Probably thinking about candles.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.234
Liam's not such
a fan of shop talk,

02:15.236 --> 02:16.968
Or spending too much time
with people from work.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.037
What?

02:19.039 --> 02:22.307
I just think it's better
if we maintain boundaries.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.576
Work-life balance, ross.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.244
Right. I get it.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.580
I was thinking the same thang.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.916
You know, I'll bring by one
of my white laundry candles.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.250
I mean,
it's not quite hotel pool,

02:32.319 --> 02:34.519
But I think the hints of
bleach should get you there.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.678
Mm. Smells good.

02:59.747 --> 03:00.612
Oh, you can have me.

03:00.747 --> 03:01.747
(meowing)

03:01.749 --> 03:02.847
Uh, my food.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.683
Oh, sorry. I'm about to
aspirate some cells.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.551
Oh, it's okay. I'm sterile.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.486
I mean my hands, not my...

03:08.522 --> 03:09.621
Good weekend?

03:09.657 --> 03:12.224
Yeah. Ravi and I
went free climbing.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.259
Cool. Ah, how much
does it normally cost?

03:14.328 --> 03:16.028
It just means
climbing with ropes.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.630
Right. Yeah.
I never climb with ropes, so...

03:18.765 --> 03:19.865
You climb?
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.500
I mean, smaller stuff.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.036
Ah, trees and stairs.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.104
Uh...

03:26.240 --> 03:28.774
Oh! And I do orienteering.

03:28.776 --> 03:29.808
Oh, fun!

03:29.877 --> 03:31.109
Yeah.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.844
You-you, uh, run through the
woods and find flags.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.246
Wait, like the kids' game?

03:34.248 --> 03:36.514
Yeah, we-- the kids
have their own division.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.183
(knocking)

03:38.185 --> 03:40.184
We're out of wilderness grain
so I gave you grass-fed beef,

03:40.221 --> 03:41.119
No extra charge.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.454
Unacceptable, deb.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.122
Oh, no. The animals
prefer grass-fed, actually.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.189
It's just pricier.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.658
You can't let them
swindle you.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.793
I said no extra charge.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.329
Deal.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.497
Oh, cool tattoo.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.533
Yeah. It's a norse symbol.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.536
My lady's convinced that we
met in a past life as vikings.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.803
I think tattoos are hot.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.938
I'd love for ravi
to get one, but--

04:00.975 --> 04:02.541
But he's too scared?

04:02.543 --> 04:04.610
No, he's worried that it would
camouflage his muscle tone.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.677
(meowing)

04:05.746 --> 04:07.012
Well, sounds like
ravi can't commit.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.413
Well, it's not for everyone.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.949
Well, no cold feet here.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.684
Although,
hand circulation is an issue.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.021
Put 'em in your pits.
Those are nature's mittens.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.188
See ya.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.126
Okay, time for lunch.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.363
Oh, I'm good.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.948
Hola! Como estás?

04:43.984 --> 04:47.185
Oh, ah, nosotras no

04:47.221 --> 04:51.389
Oh, uh, nosotras no hablamos
mucho español.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.192
Is she spanish?

04:54.194 --> 04:54.993
Ah, I'm not.
Oh, good.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.728
Oh, I don't mean "good,"
as in, like,

04:56.764 --> 04:59.531
"I don't like spanish people."
we just don't speak spanish.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.199
Except to our dog.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.234
Who's spanish.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.736
Aw. Love it.
I'm shannon, by the way.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.270
Hi! Olivia.
This is my husband.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.405
Hi.
George.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.673
I'm george.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.542
And this is javier,
our little dominican rescue!

05:10.677 --> 05:12.144
Aw! He's so cute.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.346
We have some
island rescues at work.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.414
Sorry, I work at
hamilton east animal shelter.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.282
You must know liam.
George: Of course.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.283
Sorry. He doesn't mean that.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.219
What?
I just said, "of course."

05:21.288 --> 05:22.821
He's just a little bit pushy.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.288
George or liam?
Both!

05:24.325 --> 05:25.490
You know, not that I mind.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.825
Twenty years in
the newspaper business,

05:26.894 --> 05:28.360
I can handle it.
Mm-hm.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.829
Well, if you ever want a little
companion for javier,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.497
We just started a potcake
program at the shelter.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.299
Really?
Mm-hm.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.235
We just homed and dewormed
20 pups from turks and caicos.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.669
Amazing.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.638
You should pop by my place.
We can chat more about it.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.841
Maybe you can even
write a little story?

05:42.910 --> 05:45.643
"extree extree!
We got potcake pups!"

05:45.645 --> 05:47.111
I'm sure that's
not how it works.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.781
It's not, but our city desk
is always looking for stories.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.117
Great! I'm in 504, by the way.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.419
Oh, you're the one that
keeps losing her mitten.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.121
He's a cat named middens.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.189
Got ya.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.761
Hey, paul.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.061
And joy.

06:04.098 --> 06:04.996
What's up?

06:05.132 --> 06:06.665
You have tattoos, right?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.333
Why, because
I been to prison?

06:08.335 --> 06:10.802
No. No, I just--

06:10.838 --> 06:12.137
I'm kidding. I got tattoos.

06:12.139 --> 06:15.139
I can also make a shiv
and a toilet rosé.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.108
Oh.
Can I see your tattoos?

06:17.111 --> 06:19.144
The closest I've had
is a henna tattoo,

06:19.213 --> 06:20.945
But I got
an allergic reaction,

06:20.981 --> 06:23.215
So it looked like these
really beautiful hives.

06:23.217 --> 06:26.718
Uh, yeah, I got a couple above
the equator I can show you.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.687
"ella?" aw!
That's so sweet!

06:29.723 --> 06:31.022
Yeah?
Yeah, it turned out pretty good,

06:31.091 --> 06:32.224
If I do say so myself.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.625
Did it hurt?

06:33.627 --> 06:36.194
Like a mf, but I wanted to
keep ella close to me, so.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.096
So romantic!

06:38.165 --> 06:40.499
Well, ella's my daughter,
so, not so much.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.234
Okay. Wrong word,
but, still, so romantic.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.669
What's that?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.103
Ah, that's not my best work.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.505
You drew that?

06:47.541 --> 06:48.973
Yeah.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.442
I would love
something like that.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.311
(both laughing)

06:53.347 --> 06:54.712
What's so funny?

06:54.714 --> 06:56.047
I laugh when I'm nervous.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.849
A tattoo's a big commitment.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.250
Maybe you should think it over.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.286
Oh, you don't think
I'm man enough for it?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.221
I wasn't thinking that.
I was.

07:03.223 --> 07:06.191
No, I just think that
you're a really great artist,

07:06.260 --> 07:07.726
And I thought it
would be nice if a friend

07:07.728 --> 07:08.793
Gave me my first 'too.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.595
Nobody calls it that.
Never mind.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.197
I'm sure I can get someone else
to take my money.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.932
Hundred bucks,
plus tax and tip.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.734
Done.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.736
Risk taking.
What a thrill.

07:17.871 --> 07:18.937
Thanks, paul.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.871

07:26.480 --> 07:27.812

Can't this wait?

07:27.815 --> 07:28.880
Some of us have plans.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.283
I ran into olivia pacheva
from the herald.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.684
Was that little beast
with her?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.418
Javier's super cute.
I meant her husband.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.688
Well, they're all great.
She's so fun and I convinced her

07:36.757 --> 07:40.025
To write a feature
on the shelter. Holla!

07:40.160 --> 07:42.093
What? This is a big deal.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.895
Our shelter has
zero media presence.

07:43.897 --> 07:44.996
I wouldn't say zero.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.697
Okay, so we have
an ad in the coffee news

07:46.733 --> 07:47.966
And we're on bumble
for some reason.

new workout regime.

16:24.951 --> 16:27.284
Little something I call,
boulders on shoulders.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.552
Is that safe?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.120
Or it could be
the fresh ink.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.691
My new tattoo.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.159
Really?

16:35.161 --> 16:36.494
We were just talking about that.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.162
Yeah and I thought,
"let's just do this."

16:38.164 --> 16:39.563
I mean, that's me.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.233
I'm totally spontaneous
and totally tatted.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.102
Wow! Living in the moment,
man. Kudos.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.037
See? Some people
just do it.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.173
Don't think it over
for three months.

16:49.308 --> 16:52.043
Yeah, wha...
No big deal but, uh, check it.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.115
What is it?

16:57.117 --> 16:59.984
Ah, no.
It's-- it's a flying fish.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.854
Oh wait, no!
Dragon in a flood.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.789
Whatever it is, man,
I love it.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.557
Soaring crane.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.794
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
It's just a bit blurry.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.062
Kristian:
What?

17:11.197 --> 17:14.498
Lara:
Oh, maybe the ink
hasn't set yet?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.601
Ravi:
Oh! Hey! Now I see it.

17:16.736 --> 17:17.935
So majestic.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.113
What the heck?
I paid you for a tattoo.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.549
That marker said permanent.

17:31.618 --> 17:32.650
Paul!

17:32.652 --> 17:34.218
Look, I was going to
give you a real one,

17:34.353 --> 17:36.287
But then I figured
what's the point, you know,

17:36.356 --> 17:37.955
After you passed out,
rolled over,

17:37.957 --> 17:38.956
And fell on your clipboard.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.426
Oh. I thought nikki
broke it.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.628
Don't be embarrassed.
When I did my ella tattoo,

17:43.763 --> 17:45.630
I thought I was
going to pass out.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.966
I mean, I didn't.
I'm a man, but I get it.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.435
So, you just
drew on my back?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.170
Well, you just
seemed so nervous.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.640
I thought maybe you should
give it a try first, you know?

17:56.709 --> 17:57.674
A test run.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.643
Now she thinks
I'm an idiot.

17:58.778 --> 17:59.710
Who?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.045
No one.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.780
Look, do you know why
I wear long sleeves so much?

18:03.817 --> 18:05.783
I just assumed eczema.

18:05.785 --> 18:10.321
Because I'm not always proud of
what's under 'em, you know?

18:10.390 --> 18:12.656
They remind me of who
I used to be, not who I am.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.458
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.727
No. I truly don't
care how you feel,

18:16.729 --> 18:18.629
But if you're
going to get a tattoo,

18:18.764 --> 18:20.330
You've gotta have
a good reason, you know?

18:20.366 --> 18:23.467
And if you do ever
really want one,

18:23.503 --> 18:25.002
I'll do it for free.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.270
Okay, thanks.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.771
Yeah.

18:27.841 --> 18:28.940
I'll think about it.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.675
And, hey, at least
I started working out again.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.075
I'm actually pretty sore.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.944
Well, that's where you
rolled on your clipboard.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.112
Let me have this.

18:38.484 --> 18:39.951
Hi, it's me again.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.952
Shannon, from your bed.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.955
Obviously,
big apologies there.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.656
Also, totally out of character.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.758
I had just kind of come
from a blow-out hang.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.693
Karaoke.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.827
There were seven of us

18:49.962 --> 18:51.228
And the first person
bought a round,

18:51.297 --> 18:53.397
So then everybody bought
a round-- it's not important.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.199
Anyway, call me.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.602
Wow. How bad was the sex?

18:57.604 --> 18:59.369
It wasn't sex.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.270
So, bad.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.774
Are you vaping?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.176
No.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.510
Furnace is broken.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.711
Chilly, huh?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.514
I can smell the hazelnut.
I'm taking that.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.714
Get your own.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.583
'kay, I'm off.
Call me if you hear back.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.251
And, don't worry,
we'll get this all sorted out.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.453
He was there, too?
(laughing)

19:16.489 --> 19:18.522
Oh, my god.
Stop stealing my vape.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.890
Then don't leave
it at reception.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.426
Shannon!

19:22.428 --> 19:24.529
Oh, wow! Olivia.
It's good to see you.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.930
So sorry
if I rambled yesterday.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.531
George is a lovely man.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.532
What?

19:28.535 --> 19:29.700
Maybe we should
chat in my office?

19:29.736 --> 19:30.902
I didn't put my
best foot forward,

19:31.037 --> 19:33.003
Or feet that should
have been socked.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.372
Oh, no,
you weren't the problem.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.773
I mean,
the whole thing is mortifying

19:35.908 --> 19:37.341
And it's so unprofessional.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.909
Well, I'm sorry for
having a few drinks.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.411
What?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.046
I got drunk and I stumbled
into her apartment.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.414
I fell asleep, naked,
and stole a pair of pants.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.415
Yep.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.851
It's like a Thursday for me.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.652
It was an honest mistake,
unlike denying this shelter

19:48.688 --> 19:49.954
Some much-needed publicity.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.689
I really don't
know her that well.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.090
It's those stupid unit numbers.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.425
The fours look like ones
and the ones look like ls.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.826
That's an award-winning font.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.862
Look, please,
I didn't hold back the story

19:57.864 --> 19:59.797
Because you were drunk.
I didn't publish it,

19:59.799 --> 20:03.367
Because I taped over your
interview when I spoke to liam.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.769
I feel like an idiot.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.570
Maybe not like you do, but--
okay, we get it.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.038
Liam:
So, my stuff's fine?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.607
I was just here to
re-interview shannon,

20:09.676 --> 20:11.509
And to take a photo
for the piece.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.710
I mean, unless you don't want--

20:12.779 --> 20:13.911
No, no, no, no, no!
We def do.

20:14.046 --> 20:14.978
Yes.
We do.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.413
Olivia:
That's great.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.382
Oh, finally, some real exposure.
I mean, for the shelter.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.717
You've already had yours.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.718
Shut it.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.586
Your building sounds awesome.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.787
Units still available.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.961
Shannon:
She says our
programs are outstanding.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.263
That's a quote from you.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.399
Okay, facts are facts.
Ah, and here you are:

20:35.401 --> 20:37.534
"liam turner,
the shelter's board chair--"

20:37.570 --> 20:40.003
"...Spoke at length about
his vision for the shelter.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.406
While mr. Turner can
be overbearing at times,

20:42.541 --> 20:44.175
I was slightly
charmed by him."

20:46.212 --> 20:47.144
It's a compliment.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.546
That's what you
get for opening up.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.149
Don't take it too seriously.
I think you're alluring,

20:52.185 --> 20:55.886
Exotic, a breath of fresh air
with valleys of mystery

20:55.888 --> 20:57.621
And sensual confidence.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.156
I know that's
a candle description.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.558
But say it again.

21:01.560 --> 21:02.693
Should I get more bubbly?

21:02.695 --> 21:05.362
Actually, uh,
we should get going.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.497
Oh, but sushi's
on the way.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.099
And I just feel like a--

21:08.234 --> 21:09.566
Yeah. Me, too.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.370
Okay. I see what's going on!

21:12.505 --> 21:13.771
Work-life balance, shans.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.140
Oh, my god! You called me shans!
Bring it in.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.076
I don't like
where this is going.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.245
Mm. I can really smell
the hints of lavender now.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.180
Thank you.
