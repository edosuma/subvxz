I'M IN A RUT.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.328
NOTHING THRILLS
ME ANYMORE.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.372
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN
THINK OF A REASON

00:38.455 --> 00:40.249
TO GET OFF THE BED
IN THE MORNING.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.542
REALLY.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.502
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW PATHETIC
MY LIFE IS?

00:43.585 --> 00:45.087
I-I'VE SEEN
THAT BEHIND THE MUSIC

00:45.170 --> 00:46.505
WITH LEIF GARRETT
18 TIMES.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.050
Hey, uh... hey, Leif.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.176
It's been a while.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.261
Too long, man.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.930
( mouthing words ):
I'm so sorry about everything, man.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.390
Friend:
Ready for a bombshell?

00:56.473 --> 00:57.850
You saved my
life that night.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.560
Leif: But-but I was driving. I...

00:59.643 --> 01:01.562
I was on a road to
destruction, man.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.773
The accident may have
crippled me, but I'm alive, aren't I?

01:04.857 --> 01:06.900
Ca... can we turn off
the cameras, dude?

01:06.984 --> 01:08.443
IT'S LIKE I'M...

01:08.527 --> 01:10.445
I DON'T KNOW, TRAPPED
IN MY OWN LIFE.

01:10.529 --> 01:13.532
WELL, BRIAN, YOU MAY BE
TOO INWARDLY FOCUSED.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.868
TRY THINKING ABOUT
THE NEEDS OF OTHERS FOR A CHANGE.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.369
WHY DON'T YOU DO
SOME VOLUNTEER WORK?

01:17.452 --> 01:19.746
OH, THAT MAKES SENSE--
VOLUNTEER WORK.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.873
THANKS, BRUCE.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.083
YOU STILL HAVE
13 MORE MINUTES.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.419
OH, DO I? HMM.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.714
I, UH, I NOTICE
YOU GOT A NEW RECEPTIONIST.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.091
( chuckles ):
NICE LITTLE BODY ON HER, HUH?

01:31.175 --> 01:33.010
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.681
WELL, WE COULD PROBABLY CALL THIS
AN EARLY DAY, HUH?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.561
ATTENTION, EVERYONE.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.188
DUE TO SEVERAL COMPLAINTS

01:44.271 --> 01:46.398
ON THE TWO DEATHS
RELATED TO WORKER FATIGUE

01:46.481 --> 01:49.276
I HAVE DECIDED TO THROW
A COMPANY PICNIC THIS SATURDAY.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.612
HEY, DEREK, HOW YOU
GETTING TO THE PICNIC?

01:51.695 --> 01:53.530
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T HAVE A RIDE.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.908
HEY, JOHN, YOU GOT
A TWO-SEATER, DON'T YOU?

01:55.991 --> 01:59.119
HEY, DEREK, MAYBE YOU
GO WITH JOHN, HUH? HUH?

01:59.203 --> 02:01.955
FOR THE LAST TIME,
I'M NOT GAY.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.081
THANKS ANYWAY, PETER.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.333
HEY, WE'LL GET HIM.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.126
HERE, RIGHT THIS WAY.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.961
WATCH YOUR STEP.

02:08.921 --> 02:11.465
OKAY, THEY'RE...
THEY'RE IN THE WOODS...

02:11.548 --> 02:13.300
THE CAMERA
KEEPS ON MOVING...

02:13.383 --> 02:16.803
UH, I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR SOME WITCH OR SOMETHING.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.847
I DON'T KNOW,
I WASN'T LISTENING.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.307
NOTHING'S HAPPENING...

02:20.390 --> 02:22.309
NOTHING'S HAPPENING...

02:22.392 --> 02:24.770
SOMETHING ABOUT A MAP...

02:24.853 --> 02:26.772
NOTHING'S HAPPENING...

02:26.855 --> 02:28.065
IT'S OVER.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.442
A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THE AUDIENCE LOOK PISSED.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.575
NOW, REMEMBER, CHRIS,
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

02:38.659 --> 02:40.536
SO THAT OUR STEPS...

02:40.619 --> 02:43.997
( laughing )

02:45.541 --> 02:47.125
AW, THIS
IS MY FAVORITE EVENT--

02:47.209 --> 02:48.794
CATCH THE GREASED-UP
DEAF GUY.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.462
GO!

02:50.546 --> 02:52.756
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
CATCH ME!

02:52.840 --> 02:54.383
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TIME.

02:54.466 --> 02:55.467
FORGET ABOUT IT.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.344
GO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.847
SEE YOU NEXT YEAR!

03:02.307 --> 03:03.725
KING ME.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.686
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
ANYMORE.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.104
THE PAIN.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.231
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS,
BRIAN.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.150
I NEED YOU
TO PULL THE PLUG.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.111
( beeping )

03:14.194 --> 03:16.113
WELL, I... I...
I CAN'T! I...

03:16.196 --> 03:18.282
( weakly ):
BE MY ANGEL AND SET ME FREE.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.409
PLEASE?

03:24.955 --> 03:26.999
( beeping )

03:28.333 --> 03:29.751
OH, MY GOD!

03:29.835 --> 03:31.211
YOU WERE REALLY
GOING TO DO IT!

03:31.295 --> 03:32.546
I... BUT...

03:32.629 --> 03:34.548
NURSE! THIS DOG

03:52.649 --> 03:54.067
BE LET IT BE A
FIGHT CONTEST.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.278
THESE ARE TRANQUILIZER DARTS.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.364
I HAVE ENOUGH HERE
TO TAKE DOWN ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.741
( laughing )

04:00.824 --> 04:02.117

04:20.135 --> 04:22.012
DOESN'T HE?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.805
DOESN'T HE RUN

04:24.848 --> 04:25.933
HEY, THERE, BRIAN.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.032
( snickering )

04:42.115 --> 04:43.450
OH, I'M SORRY.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.993
NO, THAT WAS GOOD.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.163
I JUST, I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING
TO GO SO CARTOONY WITH IT.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.123
WELL, HOW-HOW-HOW
WOULD YOU READ IT?

04:50.207 --> 04:51.291
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

04:51.375 --> 04:52.751
I WAS THINKING
OF DOING IT

04:52.835 --> 04:54.586
YOU KNOW, GOOD,

04:54.670 --> 04:56.797
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOUR

05:05.973 --> 05:07.933
ONE OF US IS GOING TO
WIN THAT PAID VACATION.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.561
BUT I-I DON'T WANT
TO FEED GRANDMA BACON

05:10.644 --> 05:12.479
WHILE SHE'S

05:52.352 --> 05:54.313
THEN YOU MADE LOVE
TO TWO FILIPINO WOMEN.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.981
( sniffing ):

06:57.501 --> 06:58.836
THIS ISN'T BAD.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.214
IT'S NOT THAT GOOD,
BUT IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.423

A SNAUSAGE?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.139
( laughing )

07:11.223 --> 07:12.307
CLEVER, PETER.

CRUISES ARE THE BEST.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.102
AND LOOK, IT SAYS WE HAVE
OUR CHOICE OF CABINS--

09:20.185 --> 09:21.937
PORT OR STARBOARD.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.188
HA! LISTEN TO ME.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.898
I SOUND LIKE
AN OLD SALT.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.984
( laughing )

09:27.067 --> 09:29.236
( mocking laughter)

09:29.319 --> 09:30.320
YES, THOUGH, I MUST SAY

09:30.404 --> 09:31.947
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF A LIFE AT SEA.

TO THE PARTY.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.192
WOW, BRIAN, HAVE
YOU LOST WEIGHT?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.943
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL
ME YOUR SECRET.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.695
HERE'S A HINT:
PUT DOWN THE FORK!

10:11.778 --> 10:13.238
FACE!

10:13.322 --> 10:15.824
SO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

10:15.908 --> 10:17.201
MY DAY?
UN-FREAKIN'-BELIEVEABLE.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.785
FIRST-FIRST, WE NAILED
THIS BASTARD

10:18.869 --> 10:21.330
WHO HAD THE GALL TO HIDE HIS
STUFF IN HIS DAUGHTER'S DOLL.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.623
HER DOLL, FOR GOD'S SAKE!

10:22.706 --> 10:23.707
( draws deeply )

10:23.790 --> 10:24.833
OH, WHERE'S THE LINE
ANYMORE?

10:24.917 --> 10:26.251
WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU--

10:26.335 --> 10:28.587
IT-IT-IT-IT'S NOT EVEN
ON THE RADAR SCREEN!

10:28.670 --> 10:30.714
THE DAYS OF DECENCY
AND VIRTUE ARE GONE, HONEY.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.216
BAM! FREAKIN' EVAPORATED

10:32.299 --> 10:33.926
LIKE A DINGY, STINKIN'
MUD PUDDLE.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.428
ONE-ONE DAY, YOU-YOU SEE
YOUR REFLECTION IN IT

10:36.512 --> 10:37.888
AND THE NEXT DAY,
IT'S, UH, A...

10:37.971 --> 10:40.474
IT'S, UH, IT'S A DAMN OIL SPOT
ON YOUR CRACKED DRIVEWAY

10:40.557 --> 10:41.975
STARING BACK AT YOU,
MOCKING YOU

10:42.059 --> 10:43.227
"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!"

10:43.310 --> 10:44.436
KNOWING THE PERVERTED TRUTH

10:44.520 --> 10:45.938
WOULD ROT IN THE PIT
OF YOUR SOUL.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.731
THAT'S HOW MY FREAKIN' DAY WAS.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.152
YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVEN'T
HAD IN A WHILE?

10:52.236 --> 10:53.612
BIG LEAGUE CHEW.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.531
( bell ringing )

10:55.614 --> 10:58.367
SO, TAKE IT FROM ME,
McGRIFFIN, THE DRUG DOG

10:58.450 --> 11:01.870
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET HIGH,
IT'S AS EASY AS BEING YOURSELF.

11:01.954 --> 11:05.415
WELL, KIDS, I'M GOING
TO PASS THINGS OFF NOW TO...

11:05.499 --> 11:08.961
GERALD, THE HAPPY AND ABSTINENT
POLICE CLOWN.

11:09.044 --> 11:12.881
HEY, KIDS,
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HAPPY?

11:13.757 --> 11:16.635
'CAUSE I'M FREE OF "S...

11:16.718 --> 11:17.845
"T...

11:17.928 --> 11:19.680
Ds."

11:22.975 --> 11:25.269
THAT McGRIFFIN GUY
WAS SO COOL.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.604
TOTALLY. I'M NEVER
DOING DRUGS NOW.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.606
( shuddering )

11:29.690 --> 11:31.275
GOT MILK?

11:31.358 --> 11:34.236
( hysterical laughter )

11:35.696 --> 11:37.489
NOW, CHRIS,
BEFORE YOU GO ON A CRUISE

11:37.573 --> 11:38.949
YOU GOT TO BUILD UP
A BASE TAN.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.368
BUT, DAD, I HEARD
THAT IF YOU USE TANNING BEDS

11:41.451 --> 11:43.745
YOU CAN GET SOMETHING
CALLED MELANOMA.

11:43.829 --> 11:47.291
OH, THAT'S JUST FANCY TALK
FOR "SEXIFIED." CLIMB IN.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.131
( high-pitched whine )

11:54.214 --> 11:56.175
HEY, WHAT KIND OF
TANNING BOOTH IS THIS?

11:56.258 --> 11:58.218
CAN'T YOU READ?
THOSE AREN'T TANNING BOOTHS.

11:58.302 --> 11:59.970
THAT WHOLE ROW
IS TIME MACHINES.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.680
AW, CRAP, WHERE
THE HELL IS HE?

12:01.763 --> 12:04.099
Chris:
HEY, DAD, I'M IN THE BIBLE DAYS

12:04.183 --> 12:07.227
AND THERE'S A WHOLE STADIUM
OF PEOPLE CLAPPING FOR ME.

12:07.311 --> 12:09.938
OH, LOOK, MY VERY OWN LION.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.106
OH, MY GOD!

12:12.107 --> 12:14.359
( growling)

12:14.443 --> 12:16.195
HUH... MUST'VE GOT
THE WRONG HEAD.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.865
AND NOW, HERE'S
SOMETHING WE HOPE YOU'LL REALLY LIKE.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.957
WHOA, BRIAN, THERE'S NO SMOKING
IN THE TERMINAL.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.293
HEY, HEY, THERE'S WORSE THINGS
THAN NICOTINE, PAL

12:31.376 --> 12:32.628
AND I'M GOING TO FIND THEM.

12:32.711 --> 12:33.795
( with Irish accent ):
AH, PATIENCE, LAD.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.089
IT TOOK DEAR
ST. PATRICK MORE THAN A DAY

12:36.173 --> 12:37.925
TO CLEAR THE EMERALD
ISLE OF SNAKES.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.093
OH, CAN THE IRISH CRAP,
WILL YOU, HOROWITZ?

12:40.177 --> 12:41.595
( normal voice ):
OKAY.

12:41.678 --> 12:42.930
OPEN IT!

12:43.013 --> 12:45.224
AH, LET ME GO!
HELP! HELP!

12:45.307 --> 12:46.683
( sniffing )

12:46.767 --> 12:48.143
ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S THE STASH?

12:48.227 --> 12:50.062
I'LL DO A FREAKING
BODY CAVITY SEARCH, I SWEAR.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.396
( yelling )
( sniffing )

12:51.480 --> 12:52.898
SIR, WE APOLOGIZE.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.483
( yelling)

12:54.566 --> 12:56.610
THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO SAY THIS:
I THINK YOU HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.694
A DRUG PROBLEM?

12:57.778 --> 12:59.238
WHAT'S THIS REALLY
ABOUT, JEALOUSY?

12:59.321 --> 13:01.323
AM I STEALING
YOUR THUNDER, JOE, IS THAT IT?

13:01.406 --> 13:02.407
GIVE ME YOUR BADGE.

13:02.491 --> 13:03.784
FINE! BY THE
WAY, HOROWITZ

13:03.867 --> 13:05.994
YOU SHOULD SHOW JOE
YOUR IMPRESSION OF HIM.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.372
OH, WELL, NOT, I...

13:08.455 --> 13:10.374
IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS,
YOU KNOW, MY IRISH COP.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.875
IT'S JUST A
LITTLE THING I...

13:11.959 --> 13:13.377
LOOK AT ME, I'M JOE.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.503
MY LEGS DON'T WORK

13:14.586 --> 13:17.339
BUT I MAKE UP FOR IT
BY HAVING A VERY STRONG UPPER BODY.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.967
WELL, I DO SAY THAT.

13:23.220 --> 13:24.930
OH, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.349
I SEE YOU'RE GETTING
IN THE MOOD FOR OUR CRUISE.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.476
YEAH, STUPID FISHERMAN...

13:29.560 --> 13:32.062
SITTING OUT THERE ON A BOAT
YAMMERING TO HIMSELF.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.690
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
I'M WATCHING HIM.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.111
AH, SPLENDID.
FIDO McCOKE FIEND IS HOME.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.612
EVERYBODY, THIS IS TINA.

13:40.696 --> 13:41.864
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

13:41.947 --> 13:43.365
HEY, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE LESS QUESTIONS

13:43.448 --> 13:44.783
AND A LITTLE MORE
SHUT THE HELL UP.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.994
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T FEEL YOUR TEETH

13:47.077 --> 13:49.162
DOESN'T MEAN THE GIRL
CAN'T FEEL YOUR INSULTS.

13:49.246 --> 13:52.291
HELLO, I'M LOIS GRIFFIN.

13:52.374 --> 13:53.834
WELCOME TO OUR HOME.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.128
SO, WHAT? SHE'S, LIKE,
YOUR MOM OR SOMETHING?

13:56.211 --> 13:57.880
( hysterical laughter)

13:57.963 --> 13:59.464
( goofy laughter )

13:59.548 --> 14:01.508
TINA, CAN I GET YOU
A WARM WASHCLOTH

14:01.592 --> 14:03.927
TO WIPE THE DRIED BLOOD
FROM UNDER YOUR NOSE?

14:04.011 --> 14:06.388
HERE, BABY, I'LL SHOW
YOU THE CHANNEL LOIS DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.931
BRIAN, WOULD YOU...?
CHRIS, LOOK AWAY.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.266
MEG, TAKE
STEWIE UPSTAIRS.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.101
WAIT, THAT MAN SEEMS
TO HAVE SUFFERED

14:11.185 --> 14:12.603
A RATHER SERIOUS
SNAKEBITE.

14:12.686 --> 14:16.315
BRIAN, WOULD YOU PLEASE ASK
YOUR NEW FRIEND TO LEAVE NOW.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.567
OH, SORRY, THINGS GETTING
A LITTLE TOO REAL

14:18.650 --> 14:19.943
FOR THE STEPFORD WIFE?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.821
AND LOOK AT YOU TWO--
QUASIMODO AND LUMPY.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.656
I LEAVE MORE PERSONALITY

14:24.740 --> 14:27.159
IN TIGHTLY COILED PILES
ON THE LAWN.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.994
OH, DO ME. DO ME NEXT!

14:29.077 --> 14:31.455
COME ON, BABY GIRL,
LET'S GO TO THE PARK.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.087
( door opens )

14:39.171 --> 14:40.881
HEY, DOC, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:40.964 --> 14:43.509
YOUR FAMILY HAS SOMETHING
THEY'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.761
"BRIAN, I KNOW
I DON'T SPEAK UP MUCH

14:45.844 --> 14:49.306
AND IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO
TALK ABOUT MY FEELINGS, BUT..."

14:49.389 --> 14:52.184
WHY DON'T WE START WITH SOMEONE
MORE INTERESTING? PETER?

14:52.267 --> 14:53.644
( clears throat )

14:53.727 --> 14:56.313
"BRIAN, EVER SINCE YOUR
ADDICTION, YOU'VE BEEN A JERK.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.899
I MISS THE GOOD OLD DAYS
WHEN YOU WERE MY SIDEKICK."

14:58.982 --> 15:01.026
AH, SO SHE HATED MY TIE

15:01.109 --> 15:05.197
UNTIL I TOLD HER IT WAS MADE
OUT OF 100% BUTTOFUOCO FIBER.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.865
( audience laughing )

15:06.949 --> 15:08.867
AH, YUP, YUP.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.869
AH, YUP, YUP.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.704
( nonsensical sounds )

15:12.788 --> 15:15.541
HEY, UH, BRIAN,
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE TIE MUSIC.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.544
♪♪ PETER'S TIE, PETER'S TIE ♪♪

15:18.627 --> 15:21.880
♪♪ THAT'S BECAUSE
PETER'S THE GUY. ♪♪

15:21.964 --> 15:24.091
ALL RIGHT, THERE IT IS--
A LITTLE TIE MUSIC.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.009
( audience laughing )

15:26.093 --> 15:29.888
( giggling )

15:29.972 --> 15:31.890
LOOK, YOU-YOU GUYS
GOT IT ALL WRONG.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.392
I-I-I...

15:34.643 --> 15:36.854
OH, I'M SO SORRY, EVERYONE!

15:36.937 --> 15:38.814
OH, GOD, I NEED HELP.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.148
( sobbing )

15:40.232 --> 15:42.985
WELL, I GUESS NOW WE KNOW
WHAT KIND OF DOG HE IS--

15:43.068 --> 15:44.444
A MELAN-COLLIE.

15:44.528 --> 15:45.612
( laughing )

15:45.696 --> 15:46.738
( laughter trails off )

15:46.822 --> 15:47.906
NOTHING?

15:47.990 --> 15:49.533
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.869
NO, I SHOULD'VE SAID...
I SHOULD'VE SAID, "CHI-WAH-WAH."

15:51.952 --> 15:53.871
( laughing )

15:54.997 --> 15:58.417
I DON'T HAVE
TO ( bleep ) IMPRESS YOU.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.627
LOOK, I'M NOT
INSENSITIVE, LOIS

16:00.711 --> 16:02.838
BUT I JUST DON'T SEE WHY WE GOT
TO CANCEL OUR CRUISE

16:02.921 --> 16:04.173
JUST 'CAUSE THE
DOG'S A COKEHEAD.

16:04.256 --> 16:07.009
WE'RE NOT GOING ON VACATION
WHILE BRIAN'S IN REHAB.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.261
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT
TILL NEXT YEAR.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.512
OH, MAN.

16:10.596 --> 16:11.680
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.265
I HAVE A COUSIN
WHO WORKS AT CLUB MED.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.600
♪♪ ME MIND ON FIRE ♪♪

16:14.683 --> 16:16.059
♪♪ ME SOUL ON FIRE ♪♪

16:16.143 --> 16:17.895
♪♪ FEELING HOT, HOT, HOT... ♪♪

16:18.604 --> 16:20.939
HOLY CRAP! LOOK
AT THIS PLACE!

16:21.023 --> 16:24.651
THIS IS WHERE GOD WOULD COME
IF HE HAD TO STOP DOING BLOW.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.153
THEY HAVE TENNIS COURTS!

16:26.236 --> 16:27.237
AND A FULL SPA!

16:27.321 --> 16:30.073
WOW! NO WONDER PEOPLE DO DRUGS.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.868
GOOD LUCK, BRIAN. I JUST KNOW
YOU'RE GOING TO GET CLEAN.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.828
HEH-- IT SHOULDN'T BE
TOO HARD TO GET CLEAN

16:34.912 --> 16:37.039
WITH ALL THESE
MINERAL BATHS AND JACUZZIS.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.832
( all laughing )

16:38.916 --> 16:41.001
OH, I SEE,
THE FAT MAN MAKES A PUN

16:41.084 --> 16:42.503
AND EVERYONE WETS THEMSELVES.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.088
I GIVE YOU GOLD AND I GET SQUAT.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.840
I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.511
THAT WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE
FIRST DAY, BRAIN.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.430
OUR GOAL HERE
IS TO FIND YOUR "X" FACTOR--

16:53.514 --> 16:54.848
THE ELEMENT IN YOUR LIFE

16:54.932 --> 16:57.184
THAT MADE YOU TURN TO DRUGS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.602
WELL, JUST HAVING
SOME TIME AWAY

16:58.685 --> 17:00.395
TO SORT THINGS OUT
IS GOING TO DO WONDERS.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.772
THANKS, DOCTOR.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.983
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.360
I'M ON VACATION

17:06.443 --> 17:08.612
AND OH, IF ANYONE ASKS,
I'M ALSO ON SMACK.

17:13.367 --> 17:15.285
PETER, THIS... THIS
IS A DETOX CLINIC.

17:15.369 --> 17:16.787
YOU CAN'T VACATION HERE.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.206
WHY NOT? THIS PLACE
IS WAY BETTER THAN A CRUISE.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.707
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN IT.

17:20.791 --> 17:23.043
I WHIPPED THIS SPEED FREAK'S ASS
AT HORSESHOES TODAY.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.545
PETER, THIS ISN'T
A VACATION FOR ME.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.421
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
I'M TRYING TO GET HEALTHY.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.090
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.883
HEY, SOFTBALL THIS AFTERNOON.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.718
BUNCH OF US ADDICTS
ARE TAKING ON

17:31.802 --> 17:33.971
THE PREGNANT TEENAGERS
FROM ACROSS THE LAKE.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.889
OKAY, COME ON, EVERYONE

17:35.973 --> 17:38.225
EXERCISE IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF RECOVERY.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.602
JUST WORK WITH THE RESISTANCE
OF THE WATER.

17:40.686 --> 17:41.937
TEN MORE REPS.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.231
OKAY, AND ONE, AND TWO,
AND THREE.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.149
( all gasping )

17:46.233 --> 17:47.818
OH!

17:47.901 --> 17:50.654

TO BOOBIES.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.823

18:04.334 --> 18:06.879
WHAT? IT WAS JUST CARPET FRESH.
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

18:06.962 --> 18:08.589
I'M BEEN OBSERVING
YOUR BEHAVIOR

18:08.672 --> 18:10.549
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE AN ADDICT.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.050
I THINK YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.761
WELL, I DON'T PAY YOU
TO THINK, HOT LIPS.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.889
IN FACT, I DON'T
PAY YOU AT ALL.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.307
COUNT IT.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.309
I'LL BE KEEPING MY EYE ON YOU.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.435

HEY, BRIAN,
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.

18:42.331 --> 18:44.208
HEY, YOU WANT TO GO MESS

18:47.294 --> 18:49.129

18:49.213 --> 18:50.714
