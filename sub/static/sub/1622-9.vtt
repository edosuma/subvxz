If reinforcements arrive from King's
Landing before we take the castle,

03:26.430 --> 03:30.250
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

We'll lose the war and
die the way Father died.

- What?

37:24.770 --> 37:29.810
He's my nephew. I love him.
And he's a damned fool.

(BOTH CHUCKLING)

37:35.280 --> 37:37.320
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

37:37.420 --> 37:39.830
Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.920
BLACKFISH: That's the point.

37:41.990 --> 37:43.990
Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?

37:44.090 --> 37:47.830
Aye. Lord Walder
let me choose any of his granddaughters

37:48.330 --> 37:51.930
and promised me
the girl's weight in silver as a dowry.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.670
So I have a fat young bride.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.610
(LAUGHING)

37:55.670 --> 37:57.610
I hope she makes you very happy.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.440
Well, she's made me very rich.

37:59.770 --> 38:04.520
Pardon, my lord,
my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on.

38:06.950 --> 38:10.520
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.

38:10.620 --> 38:14.120
Your mother is less in need of rescue
than any woman I've ever met.

38:14.490 --> 38:17.470
Be kind. She's finally
starting to like you.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.960
And I like her.

38:21.030 --> 38:24.370
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

38:24.460 --> 38:27.710
playing my harp
and you would be sitting over there,

38:27.970 --> 38:30.740

of Roslin Frey's hand.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.870
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.

38:35.870 --> 38:38.550
Striking your king is an act of treason.

40:54.610 --> 40:57.620

from a foreigner's perspective.

41:01.490 --> 41:02.970
It seems normal to you?

41:04.120 --> 41:05.360
It's a tradition.

Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

No, but there
are other ways of providing proof.
