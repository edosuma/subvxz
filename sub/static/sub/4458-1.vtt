17:31.817 --> 17:34.513
To make the figures come out even,
if I have no colds a year,

17:34.586 --> 17:36.110
some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.712
Yeah. It's me.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.787
You should have stayed
in bed this morning.

17:39.858 --> 17:42.520
I should have stayed in bed last night.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.186
Nineteen.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.527
Watch your step,
and watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby.

17:51.603 --> 17:52.627
I beg your pardon?

17:52.704 --> 17:56.538
One of these days I'm going to shut
these doors on you, and...

17:58.277 --> 17:59.608
Twenty next.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.137
That Kubelik, boy,

18:02.214 --> 18:04.580
would I like to get her
on a slow elevator to China.

18:04.650 --> 18:06.174
Yeah, she's the best operator
in the building.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.242
Yeah, well,
I'm a pretty good operator myself.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.185
She just won't
give me a tumble date-wise.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.688
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.420
A lot of guys around here have tried it.
All kinds of approaches. No dice.

18:15.494 --> 18:16.654
What's she trying to prove?

18:16.728 --> 18:19.595
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl.
There's millions of them.

18:47.526 --> 18:51.860
Hello, Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the nineteenth floor.

18:51.930 --> 18:55.058
Oh, Buddy-boy.
I was just about to call you.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.699
I'm sorry about that mess
on the living room wall.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.170
You see, my little friend,
she kept insisting Picasso was a bum,

19:01.240 --> 19:03.003
so she started to do that mural.

19:03.075 --> 19:07.774
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.
It's the key to my apartment.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.473
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

19:10.549 --> 19:11.675
But I did, didn't I?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.775
I distinctly remember bending over
and putting it there.

19:13.852 --> 19:17.015
Oh, I found the key, all right,
only it's the wrong key.

19:17.389 --> 19:18.549
It is?

19:18.624 --> 19:20.615
Well, how about that?

19:20.692 --> 19:23.160
No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.856
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

19:25.931 --> 19:28.525
So at 4:00 a.m.,
I got to wake up the landlady

19:28.600 --> 19:29.897
and give her a whole song and dance.

19:29.968 --> 19:31.560
That's a shame.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.261
I'll send the key right down.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.329
And about your promotion.

19:35.607 --> 19:38.667
I'm sending that efficiency report
right up to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.508
I wouldn't be surprised if you heard
from him before the day's over.

Look, Mr. Vanderhoff,
I've got you down here for tonight,

21:03.328 --> 21:06.593
but I'm going to be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.725
Cancel? But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.132
But I am sick.

21:11.203 --> 21:15.071
I got a terrible cold and a fever,
and I got to go to bed right after work.

21:15.140 --> 21:18.940
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night there. Sweat it out.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.672
That's the way you get pneumonia,

21:20.746 --> 21:23.146

I'd be in bed for a month.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.080
Okay, you made your point.

21:25.150 --> 21:27.778
We'll just have to do it
next Wednesday night.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.083
That's the only night
of the week I can get away.

to reach you for the last 20 minutes.

24:01.706 --> 24:03.640
They want you upstairs.

24:05.210 --> 24:08.543
Hey, what gives, Baxter?
You getting promoted or getting fired?

24:08.613 --> 24:10.103
Would you care to make a small wager?

24:10.182 --> 24:12.275
Well, I've been here twice as long
as you have, and they never...

24:12.350 --> 24:13.942
Like say, $1.00?

24:14.753 --> 24:16.118
It's a bet!

24:30.235 --> 24:32.533
- Going up?
- Oh, excuse me.

24:32.604 --> 24:36.472
Hi, 27, please, and drive carefully.
You're carrying precious cargo.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.441
I mean, manpower-wise.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.475
Twenty-seven.

24:40.545 --> 24:44.504

but I am in the top 10 efficiency-wise,

24:44.583 --> 24:47.609

to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.

Why not,
now that they're kicking me upstairs?

24:52.724 --> 24:54.157
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.491
You know, you're the only one around here
who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.496
- Really?
- The characters you meet.

24:59.564 --> 25:02.124
Something happens to men in elevators.
Must be the change of altitude.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.827

or something.

- Boy, I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear them.

Maybe we could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime

25:09.741 --> 25:12.039

- Twenty-seven.
- Oh.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.874
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.711

they'd call me on a day like this,

25:18.783 --> 25:20.944

How do I look?

I ever noticed about you

you always wore a flower.

25:29.794 --> 25:32.422
Good luck, and wipe your nose.

25:48.146 --> 25:50.637
C.C. Baxter,
Ordinary Premium Accounting.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.478
- Mr. Sheldrake called me.
- I called you.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.576
That is, I tried to call you for 20 minutes.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.712
- I'm sorry. I...
- Go on in.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.027
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

26:10.101 --> 26:11.728
Come in. Come in.

26:13.104 --> 26:16.073
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.405
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

26:20.111 --> 26:22.978
Been hearing some nice things about you.

26:23.048 --> 26:24.379
Have a report here from Mr. Dobisch.

26:24.449 --> 26:26.110
Says you're Ioyal,
cooperative, resourceful...

26:26.184 --> 26:27.412
Mr. Dobisch said that?

26:27.485 --> 26:29.817
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me
that several nights a week,

26:29.888 --> 26:31.685
you work late at the office
without overtime.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.247
You know how it is. Things pile up.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.383
Mr. Vanderhoff in Public Relations

26:36.461 --> 26:38.292
and Mr. Eichelberger
in Mortgage and Loans.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.423
They both would like to have you
transferred to their departments.

26:41.499 --> 26:43.160
Very flattering.

26:44.703 --> 26:48.434
Tell me, Baxter,
just what is it that makes you so popular?

26:49.140 --> 26:50.607
I don't know.

26:50.675 --> 26:51.801
Think.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.707
Would you mind repeating the question?

26:59.784 --> 27:01.877
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.818
I know everything
that goes on in this building,

27:03.888 --> 27:06.686
in every department, on every floor,
every day of the year.

27:06.758 --> 27:08.020
You do?

27:08.093 --> 27:10.926
In 1957, we had an employee here,
name of Fowler.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.623
He was very popular, too.

27:12.697 --> 27:15.530
It turned out he was running a bookie joint
right in the Actuarial department,

27:15.600 --> 27:16.828
tying up our switchboards,

27:16.901 --> 27:19.062
using our IBM Machines
to figure the odds.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.469
So the day before the Kentucky Derby,
I called in the vice squad,

27:21.539 --> 27:23.564
and we raided the thirteenth floor.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.269
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

27:25.343 --> 27:29.177
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.477
Just what kind of a joint are you running?

27:31.549 --> 27:32.709
Sir?

27:32.784 --> 27:34.877
There's a certain key
floating around this office

27:34.953 --> 27:38.184
from Kirkeby to Vanderhoff
to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.053
It's the key to a certain apartment,

27:40.125 --> 27:42.958
and do you know
who that apartment belongs to?

27:43.028 --> 27:44.120
Who?

27:44.195 --> 27:47.096
Loyal, resourceful,
cooperative C.C. Baxter.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.525
Oh.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.593
Are you going to deny it?

27:53.304 --> 27:54.362
No.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.907
I'm not going to deny...
If you just let me explain.

27:57.976 --> 27:59.443
You'd better.

27:59.878 --> 28:00.970
Well.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.613
About a year ago,
I was going to night school.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.413
I was taking this course
in advanced accounting.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.817
One of the guys in our department,
lives in Jersey,

28:09.888 --> 28:12.482
had to go to a banquet at the Biltmore.
His wife was meeting him in town.

28:12.557 --> 28:17.085
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key,

28:17.162 --> 28:20.131
and word must have gotten out
because the next thing I knew,

28:20.198 --> 28:23.133
all sorts of guys
are suddenly going to banquets.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.465
You give a key to one guy,
you can't say no to another.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.734
The whole thing got out of hand, and...
Pardon me.

28:31.142 --> 28:34.509
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

28:34.579 --> 28:37.946
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

28:38.016 --> 28:40.917
How many charter members are there
in this little club of yours?

28:40.985 --> 28:42.145
Just those four.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.121
Out of a total of 31,259,

28:45.190 --> 28:49.320
so actually, we can be very proud
of our personnel, percentage-wise.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.759
That's not the point, Baxter.

28:50.829 --> 28:53.798
Four rotten apples in a barrel,
no matter how large the barrel...

28:53.865 --> 28:55.457
Do you realize if this ever leaked out...

28:55.533 --> 28:56.898
It won't!

28:57.535 --> 28:59.628
Believe me, never again.

28:59.704 --> 29:02.571
Nobody is going to use my apartment
from now on.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.336
- Where is your apartment, Baxter?
- West 67th Street.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.640
You have no idea
what I've been going through

29:07.712 --> 29:11.148
with the neighbors and the landlady
and the liquor and the key and...

29:11.216 --> 29:12.649
How do you work it with the key?

29:12.717 --> 29:16.346
I usually slip it to them in the office,
and they leave it under a mat.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.321
Never again. I can promise you that.

29:18.523 --> 29:19.512

29:30.268 --> 29:32.395

<i>Where were you? </i>

Oh, you had to take Tommy
to the dentist, huh?

29:35.306 --> 29:37.934
No cavities. Good. Hold it, dear.

29:38.009 --> 29:40.477
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't want to intrude.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.638

everything was straightened out...

29:42.714 --> 29:44.545
I'm not through with you yet.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.016
The reason I called
is I won't be home for dinner tonight.

29:47.085 --> 29:49.144
The branch manager
from Kansas City is in town.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.051
I'm taking him to the theater.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.987
<i>Music Man: </i> What else?

29:53.057 --> 29:55.753
No, don't wait up for me, darling.
Goodbye.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.122
Tell me, Baxter,
have you seen <i>Music Man? </i>

29:59.297 --> 30:00.321
Hmm?

30:00.398 --> 30:03.162
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.532
How would you like to go tonight?

30:05.603 --> 30:06.865
What, you and me?

30:06.938 --> 30:10.135
I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.371
No. I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

30:13.444 --> 30:17.278
Well, that's very kind of you,
but I'm not feeling well.

30:17.348 --> 30:19.873
I've got this cold.
I'm going to go right home.

30:19.951 --> 30:23.045
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.155
So do I.
I'm going to take four aspirin, get into bed,

30:27.225 --> 30:29.750
so you might as well
give the tickets to somebody else.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.296
Look, Baxter,
I'm not just giving these tickets.

30:32.363 --> 30:34.126
I want to swap them.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.497
Swap them? For what?

30:39.003 --> 30:40.095
It also says here

30:40.171 --> 30:43.698
that you are alert, astute
and quite imaginative.

30:45.109 --> 30:46.098
Oh?

30:51.950 --> 30:52.939
Oh...

31:02.393 --> 31:03.621
(WHISPERING) This?

31:03.728 --> 31:05.218
That's good thinking, Baxter.

31:05.296 --> 31:07.890
There's going to be a shift in personnel
around here next month.

31:07.966 --> 31:11.265
As far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

31:11.803 --> 31:12.929
I am?

31:13.004 --> 31:14.835
Now, put down the key.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.434
And put down the address.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.473
It's on the second floor.
There's no name over the door.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.642
It just says Apartment 2-A.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.814
It's that cold.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.447
- Relax, Baxter.
- Yes, thank you, sir.

31:33.791 --> 31:36.851
You will be careful with the record player?

31:36.928 --> 31:40.159
Oh, and about the liquor,
I ordered some this morning.

31:40.231 --> 31:42.825
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.999
Now, remember, Baxter,
this is going to be our little secret.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.005
- Oh, yes, of course.
- You know how people talk.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.700
You don't have to worry about that.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.003
Not that I have anything to hide.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.806
Certainly not.
I mean, it's none of my business.

31:54.879 --> 31:59.612
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference, percentage-wise?

32:00.785 --> 32:02.616
- Here you are, Baxter.
- Thank you, sir.

32:02.687 --> 32:05.087
- Have a nice time.
- You, too, sir.

32:37.822 --> 32:41.918
So I figure a man in his position,
he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.

32:41.993 --> 32:46.225
Instead he takes me to Hamburger Heaven
and some schnook's apartment.

32:51.269 --> 32:53.328
- Good night.
- Good night.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.804
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

32:57.875 --> 32:59.172
I've been waiting for you.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.143
- You have?
- I almost didn't recognize you.

33:01.212 --> 33:04.375
This is the first time
I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.

33:04.449 --> 33:06.314
How did everything go
on the twenty-seventh floor?

33:06.384 --> 33:08.511
Great. Look, have you seen
<i>The Music Man? </i>

33:08.586 --> 33:09.610
No.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.314
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.755
I thought maybe we'd get
a bite to eat first, and then we'd go.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.292
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.488
- I'm sorry. I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

33:18.563 --> 33:22.363
- You mean, like a girlfriend?
- No, like a man.

33:22.433 --> 33:23.525
I wasn't trying to be personal.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.034
It's just the fellas in the office,

33:25.103 --> 33:27.162
they were wondering about,
you know, if you ever...

33:27.238 --> 33:29.103
You tell them now and then.

33:29.173 --> 33:33.610
This date, is it just a date,
or is it something serious?

33:33.678 --> 33:37.114
Well, it used to be serious,
at least I was, but he wasn't.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.513
So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.

33:39.584 --> 33:42.314
- In that case, couldn't you...
- No, I'm afraid not.

33:42.387 --> 33:45.550
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

33:45.623 --> 33:48.615
I... I understand.

33:49.594 --> 33:52.256
Well, it was just an idea.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.264
I'd hate to see
a theater ticket go to waste.

33:54.332 --> 33:57.495
- What time does the show go on?
- 8:30.

33:57.568 --> 34:00.059
Well, I could meet you at the theater,
if that's all right.

34:00.138 --> 34:01.730
All right? That's wonderful.

34:01.806 --> 34:04.206
It's Majestic on 44th Street.

34:04.275 --> 34:05.640
I'll meet you in the lobby, okay?

34:05.710 --> 34:08.178
Yeah. You know,
I felt so lousy this morning.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.804
Had a 101 fever.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.476
Now, along comes my promotion and us.
Eleventh row, center.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.643
And you said I should have stayed in bed.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.915
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

34:17.989 --> 34:20.422
After the show,
we could go out on the town.

34:20.491 --> 34:21.856
(LILTING)

34:21.926 --> 34:24.918
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.987
There's a great little band
at El Chico in the Village,

34:28.065 --> 34:29.556
practically around the corner
from where you live.

34:29.634 --> 34:31.033
Sounds good.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.567
How do you know where I live?

34:33.638 --> 34:38.541
Oh, I even know who you live with.
Your sister and brother-in-law.

34:38.609 --> 34:41.271
And I know
when you were born and where.

34:41.344 --> 34:43.938
- I know all sorts of things about you.
- How come?

34:44.014 --> 34:45.846
A couple of months ago,
I looked up your card

34:45.917 --> 34:48.043
in the group insurance file.

34:49.219 --> 34:52.951
I know your height and your weight
and your Social Security number.

34:53.024 --> 34:57.290
You had mumps and measles,
and you had your appendix out.

34:58.229 --> 35:01.164
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office, okay?

35:01.232 --> 35:02.790
I wouldn't want them
to get the wrong idea

35:02.867 --> 35:05.358
about how you found out. Bye.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.937
8:30!

35:27.725 --> 35:29.556
(PIANO PLAYING)

36:00.458 --> 36:02.619
Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.

36:02.693 --> 36:04.684
Please, Fran, not so loud.

36:04.762 --> 36:07.094
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

36:07.165 --> 36:10.794
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

36:12.236 --> 36:15.103
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

36:16.674 --> 36:20.007
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

36:20.077 --> 36:23.410
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

36:23.481 --> 36:26.143
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

36:27.118 --> 36:30.315
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

36:31.856 --> 36:35.849
- How long has it been, Fran, a month?
- Six weeks.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.792
But who's counting?

36:38.095 --> 36:39.585
I missed you.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.027
Like old times.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.099
Same booth, same song.

36:48.172 --> 36:49.799
It's been hell.

36:50.141 --> 36:52.871
Same sauce, sweet and sour.

36:54.679 --> 36:56.476
You don't know what it's like
standing next to you

36:56.547 --> 36:58.139
in that elevator day after day.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.708
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

37:01.786 --> 37:04.220
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

37:04.288 --> 37:07.223
Let's not start on that again, Jeff, please.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.393
I'm just beginning to get over it.

37:11.128 --> 37:12.925
I don't believe you.

37:14.899 --> 37:19.063
Look, Jeff, we had two wonderful months
this summer, but that was it.

37:19.136 --> 37:20.899
Happens all the time.

37:20.972 --> 37:25.136
Wife and kids go away to the country,
and the boss has a fling with his secretary

37:25.209 --> 37:28.042
or the manicurist or the elevator girl.

37:28.112 --> 37:31.513
Come September, the picnic's over.
Goodbye.

37:31.582 --> 37:35.575
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife,

37:35.653 --> 37:37.143
and the girl...

37:39.290 --> 37:42.384
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

37:45.463 --> 37:47.556
I never said goodbye, Fran.

37:49.667 --> 37:55.037
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.939
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch

37:58.009 --> 38:00.739
and asks you if
there's any lipstick showing,

38:00.811 --> 38:04.110
then rushes out to catch
the 7:14 to White Plains.

38:05.516 --> 38:09.111
So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee,

38:09.186 --> 38:12.121
and you sit there by yourself,
and you think.

38:13.824 --> 38:17.157
And it all begins to look so ugly.

38:20.831 --> 38:24.289
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7:14 train?

38:24.935 --> 38:29.099
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

38:29.173 --> 38:31.198
I want you back, Fran.

38:31.275 --> 38:35.075
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.977
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.312
I asked you to meet me
because I have something to tell you.

38:39.383 --> 38:42.079
- Go ahead, tell me.
- Not here.

38:42.153 --> 38:46.556
- Can't we go someplace else?
- No. I have a date at 8:30.

38:46.624 --> 38:47.750
Important?

38:47.825 --> 38:50.419
Not very,
but I'm going to be there anyway.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.258
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.061
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

39:12.883 --> 39:14.214
(COUGHS)

39:15.786 --> 39:18.550
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

39:18.622 --> 39:20.886
Do I? That leaky little boat you rented

39:20.958 --> 39:23.688
and me in a black negligee
and a life preserver.

39:23.761 --> 39:27.527
- You remember what we talked about?
- We talked about a lot of things.

39:27.598 --> 39:29.930
I mean, about my getting a divorce.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.298
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.600
You didn't really believe me, did you?

39:34.672 --> 39:39.200
They got it on a long-playing record now,
<i>Music to String Her Along By: </i>

39:39.276 --> 39:42.336
"My wife doesn't understand me.
We haven't gotten along for years.

39:42.413 --> 39:44.074
"You're the best thing
that ever happened to me."

39:44.148 --> 39:45.308
That's enough, Fran.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.715
"Just trust me, baby.
We'll work it out somehow."

39:47.785 --> 39:49.252
You're not being funny.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.878
I wasn't trying.

39:50.955 --> 39:53.219
Fran, if you'll just listen to me
for a minute.

39:53.290 --> 39:54.917
All right, I'm sorry.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.516
I saw my lawyer this morning.

39:56.594 --> 39:59.893
I wanted his advice
about the best way to handle it.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.931
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

40:04.268 --> 40:08.864
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

40:08.939 --> 40:11.840
Of course not.
You had nothing to do with it.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.045
Are you sure that's what you want?

40:16.747 --> 40:18.180
I'm sure.

40:18.649 --> 40:21.743
If you'll just tell me that you still love me.

40:23.521 --> 40:25.011
You know I do.

40:28.626 --> 40:29.752
Oh, Fran.

40:32.029 --> 40:33.018
(WOMAN LAUGHING)

40:34.064 --> 40:35.622
Jeff, darling.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.532
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.134
Taxi.

41:19.710 --> 41:23.111
- Jeff, please, I have that date, remember?
- And I love you, remember?

41:23.314 --> 41:24.303
(WHISTLES)

41:24.448 --> 41:27.440
Where are we going?
Not back to that leaky boat.

41:27.518 --> 41:28.849
I promise.

41:33.557 --> 41:35.218
51, West 67th.

42:19.770 --> 42:21.635
Congratulations.

42:37.354 --> 42:38.912
Would you mind?

42:38.989 --> 42:40.889
C.C. Baxter. That's me.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.825
Thank you.

42:59.577 --> 43:00.805
(DOOR OPENS)

43:00.978 --> 43:02.036
KIRKEBY: Hi, Buddy-boy.

43:02.112 --> 43:04.546
DOBISCH: Congratulations and all that jazz.

43:04.615 --> 43:05.809
Hi, fellas.

43:05.883 --> 43:08.249
Well, you made it, just like we promised.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.413
Quite an office. Name on the door,
rug on the floor, the whole schmear.

43:11.488 --> 43:14.423
Teamwork. That's what counts
in an organization like this.

43:14.491 --> 43:17.153
All for one and one for all,
know what I mean?

43:17.227 --> 43:18.558
Yeah, I have a vague idea.

43:18.629 --> 43:21.928
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you,
gratitude-wise.

43:21.999 --> 43:23.466
I'm very grateful.

43:23.534 --> 43:25.627
EICHELBERGER: Then why are you
locking us out all of a sudden?

43:25.703 --> 43:27.796
Well, it's been sort of rough
the past few weeks,

43:27.871 --> 43:31.136
what with my cold and like that.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.938
We went to bat for you,
and now you won't play ball with us.

43:34.011 --> 43:35.740
Well, after all, it's my apartment.

43:35.813 --> 43:38.509
It's private property.
It's not a public playground.

43:38.582 --> 43:40.379
VANDERHOFF: All right,
so you got yourself a girl.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.942
That's okay with us,
but not every night in the week.

43:43.020 --> 43:44.647
How selfish can you get?

43:44.722 --> 43:46.485
Last week,
I had to borrow my nephew's car

43:46.557 --> 43:48.684
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

43:48.759 --> 43:51.990
I'm too old for that sort of thing.
I mean, in a Volkswagen.

43:52.062 --> 43:55.293
I sympathize with your problem.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

43:55.366 --> 43:57.732
You'll be a lot sorrier
before we're through with you.

43:57.801 --> 43:58.961
Are you threatening me?

43:59.036 --> 44:02.267
Listen, Baxter, we made you,
and we can break you.

44:03.107 --> 44:06.167
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

44:06.243 --> 44:08.609
Everything satisfactory, Baxter?
Do you like your office?

44:08.679 --> 44:10.408
Yes, sir,
and I want to thank you very much.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.473
Don't thank me. Thank your friends here.
They're the ones who recommended you.

44:13.550 --> 44:15.518
We just dropped by
to wish him the best of luck.

44:15.586 --> 44:17.554
So long, Baxter.
We know you won't let us down.

44:17.621 --> 44:22.081
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open to my office.

44:23.060 --> 44:25.153
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

44:25.229 --> 44:26.560
How does it feel to be an executive?

44:26.630 --> 44:27.995
- Oh, fine.
- Sit down.

44:28.065 --> 44:30.295
I want you to know I'll work hard
to justify your confidence in me.

44:30.367 --> 44:31.994
I'm sure you will.

44:32.069 --> 44:34.594
So, Baxter, about the apartment,
now that you've got a raise,

44:34.672 --> 44:36.970
don't you think
we can afford a second key?

44:37.041 --> 44:39.441
- Well, I guess so.
- You know my secretary Miss Olsen.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.944
Oh, yeah, very attractive.
Is she the lucky girl that...

44:42.012 --> 44:43.570
Oh, no, no, no. I just meant that she's...

44:43.647 --> 44:46.115
She's kind of a busybody,
always sticking her nose in everything,

44:46.183 --> 44:48.651
and passing that key back and forth,
why take chances?

44:48.719 --> 44:50.653
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

44:50.721 --> 44:54.122
- I have something I think belongs to you.
- Me?

44:54.191 --> 44:56.091
I mean, the young lady,
whoever she may be.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.991
It was on my couch
when I got back last night.

44:58.062 --> 44:59.188
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

44:59.263 --> 45:02.596
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

45:04.468 --> 45:07.266
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

45:07.337 --> 45:10.135
Well, you know how it is. Sooner or later,
they always give you a bad time.

45:10.207 --> 45:11.231
Yeah, I know how it is.

45:11.308 --> 45:13.401
You see a girl a couple times a week,
just for laughs,

45:13.477 --> 45:15.945
and right away they think
you're going to divorce your wife.

45:16.013 --> 45:17.640
Now, I ask you, is that fair?

45:17.715 --> 45:20.582
No, sir, it's very unfair.
Especially to your wife.

45:20.651 --> 45:21.777
Yeah.

45:21.852 --> 45:23.149
You know, Baxter, I envy you.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.553
Bachelor, all the dames you want,
no headaches, no complications.

45:26.623 --> 45:28.181
Yes, sir, that's the life, all right.

45:28.258 --> 45:29.953
Oh, put me down for Thursday again.

45:30.027 --> 45:32.587
Roger, and I'll get that other key.

45:44.675 --> 45:46.540
SYLVIA: Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.

45:46.610 --> 45:48.043
Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

45:48.112 --> 45:50.046
Consolidated Life. Merry Christmas.

45:50.114 --> 45:51.103
I'm ringing.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.479
Yeah? Yeah!

45:53.550 --> 45:55.814
Where? You bet!

45:55.886 --> 45:57.183
Somebody watch my line!

45:57.254 --> 46:00.314
There's a swinging party
on the nineteenth floor!

46:02.826 --> 46:06.023
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>in a one horse open sleigh</i>

46:06.096 --> 46:09.554
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

46:09.633 --> 46:13.000
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>in a one horse open sleigh</i>

46:13.470 --> 46:16.564
<i>Dashing through the snow</i>
<i>In a one horse open sleigh</i>

46:16.740 --> 46:20.301
<i>O'er the fields we go</i>
<i>Laughing all the way</i>

46:20.544 --> 46:23.479
<i>Bells on bobtails ring</i>
<i>Making spirits bright</i>

46:23.547 --> 46:26.778
<i>What fun it is to laugh and sing</i>
<i>A sleighing song tonight</i>

46:26.984 --> 46:28.747
ALL: Hey!

46:29.186 --> 46:30.744
So I said to him, "Never again.

46:30.821 --> 46:33.984
"Either you get yourself a bigger car
or a smaller girl."

46:35.425 --> 46:37.689
Miss Kubelik! Miss...

46:37.761 --> 46:39.422
Merry Christmas.

46:39.496 --> 46:41.726
Thank you.
I thought you were avoiding me.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.391
What gave you that idea?

46:43.467 --> 46:45.662
In the last six weeks,
you've only been in my elevator once,

46:45.736 --> 46:47.260
and you didn't take off your hat.

46:47.337 --> 46:50.738
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

46:50.808 --> 46:53.003
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

46:53.076 --> 46:54.668
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

46:54.745 --> 46:57.407
You couldn't help yourself. I mean,
when you're having a drink with one man,

46:57.481 --> 46:58.573
you can't suddenly walk out on him

46:58.649 --> 47:00.810
because you're having another date
with another man.

47:00.884 --> 47:02.283
You did the only decent thing.

47:02.352 --> 47:03.410
I wouldn't be too sure.

47:03.487 --> 47:06.854
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a girl scout.

47:06.924 --> 47:08.221
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be

47:08.292 --> 47:10.089
a Second Administrative Assistant
around here

47:10.160 --> 47:12.151
unless he's a pretty good judge
of character,

47:12.229 --> 47:14.424
and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

47:14.498 --> 47:19.197
I mean, decency-wise and otherwise-wise.

47:19.269 --> 47:21.294
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.299
- One more.
- Oh, I shouldn't drink while I'm driving.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.808
You're so right.

47:26.877 --> 47:28.674
By the power vested in me,

47:28.745 --> 47:30.576
I herewith declare this elevator
out of order.

47:30.647 --> 47:32.137
Shall we join the natives?

47:33.450 --> 47:35.111
Why not? They seem friendly enough.

47:35.185 --> 47:36.812
Don't you believe it.

47:36.887 --> 47:38.752
After a while,
there will be human sacrifices.

47:38.822 --> 47:41.120
White-collar workers
tossed into the computing machines

47:41.191 --> 47:43.352
and punched full
of those little square holes.

47:43.427 --> 47:45.622
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three.

47:45.696 --> 47:46.890
I thought so.

47:46.964 --> 47:49.262
Wait a minute.
I think I hear the sound of running water.

47:49.333 --> 47:52.097
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

47:53.403 --> 47:57.772
Hi. How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

47:57.841 --> 47:58.865
I beg your pardon?

47:58.942 --> 48:01.809
- I'm Miss Olsen, Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
- Yes, I know.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.143
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

48:04.214 --> 48:08.275
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle

48:08.352 --> 48:12.914
four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

48:13.523 --> 48:15.457
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

48:15.525 --> 48:17.823
And just before me,
there was Miss Rossi in Auditing,

48:17.895 --> 48:20.796
and after me,
there was Miss Koch in Disability,

48:20.864 --> 48:25.767
and right before you was a Miss...
What's-her-name on the twenty-fifth floor.

48:25.836 --> 48:29.567
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.404
It's him. Oh, what a salesman.

48:33.076 --> 48:35.670
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant

48:35.746 --> 48:38.647
and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

48:40.918 --> 48:44.979
And in the end, you wind up
with Egg Foo Yung on your face.

48:45.389 --> 48:46.879
Miss Kubelik.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.652
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

48:51.728 --> 48:55.687
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

48:56.867 --> 48:59.097
Are you all right? What's the matter?

48:59.169 --> 49:01.899
Nothing. There are
just too many people here.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.496
Why don't we step into my office?

49:03.573 --> 49:05.871
There's something
I want your opinion about, anyhow.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.410
I have my own office now, actually.

49:07.477 --> 49:09.138
You may be interested to know that I am

49:09.212 --> 49:10.873
the second-youngest executive
in this company.

49:10.948 --> 49:14.611
The only one younger is the grandson
of the Chairman of the Board.

49:15.752 --> 49:16.741
(WHISTLES)

49:17.087 --> 49:18.577
Do you mind?

49:21.992 --> 49:25.291
Miss Kubelik,
I would like your honest opinion.

49:25.796 --> 49:29.232
I've had this under my desk for a week.
It cost me $15.

49:29.299 --> 49:32.632
Haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

49:38.208 --> 49:40.836
It's what they call
the Junior Executive model.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.503
What do you think?

49:46.616 --> 49:48.777
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

49:49.686 --> 49:51.085
I like it.

49:51.421 --> 49:53.218
Really? You wouldn't
be ashamed to be seen

49:53.290 --> 49:55.087
with somebody in a hat like this?

49:55.158 --> 49:56.887
Of course not.

49:56.960 --> 50:00.896
Maybe if I wore it a little more to one side.
How's that? Is that better?

50:00.964 --> 50:02.261
Much better.

50:02.332 --> 50:04.698
Well, since you wouldn't be ashamed
to be seen with me,

50:04.768 --> 50:06.429
how about the three of us
going out tonight?

50:06.503 --> 50:08.061
You, me and the bowler.

50:08.138 --> 50:10.698
We'll stroll down Fifth Avenue,
sort of break it in.

50:10.774 --> 50:12.071
This is a bad day for me.

50:12.142 --> 50:15.009
Oh, I understand.
Christmas, family and all that.

50:15.078 --> 50:17.569
I'd better get back to my elevator.
I don't want to be fired.

50:17.647 --> 50:21.481
You don't have to worry about that.
I got quite a bit of influence in personnel.

50:21.551 --> 50:23.485
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

50:25.222 --> 50:27.486
- Why?
- Well, he and I are like that.

50:27.557 --> 50:30.219
He sent me a Christmas card, see?

50:36.266 --> 50:38.097
Makes a cute picture.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.068
I thought maybe I'd put in a word for you

50:41.138 --> 50:42.571
with Mr. Sheldrake,
get you a little promotion.

50:42.639 --> 50:44.937
How would you
like to be an elevator starter?

50:45.008 --> 50:48.603
I'm afraid there are too many girls
around here with seniority over me.

50:48.678 --> 50:51.943
No problem. Why don't we discuss it
sometime over the holidays?

50:52.015 --> 50:54.449
I could call you and pick you up.
We'd have a big unveiling.

50:54.518 --> 50:56.383
Are you sure this is
the right way to wear this?

50:56.453 --> 50:58.648
I think so. Here.

50:58.722 --> 51:00.246
You don't think
it's tilted a little too much?

51:00.323 --> 51:02.018
I mean, after all,
this is a conservative firm.

51:02.092 --> 51:05.220
I don't want people to think
I'm an entertainer.

51:09.599 --> 51:11.260
What's the matter?

51:12.436 --> 51:13.835
Well, uh...

51:14.071 --> 51:15.902
The mirror, it's broken.

51:15.972 --> 51:19.271
Yes, I know. I like it that way.

51:19.342 --> 51:21.037
Makes me look the way I feel.

Just a minute.

51:37.494 --> 51:40.292
If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.

51:40.363 --> 51:42.194
Have a nice Christmas.

51:48.805 --> 51:50.636
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.709
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up,

51:53.777 --> 51:56.940
and the Tom and Jerry mix
is in the refrigerator.

51:57.380 --> 51:59.371
Yes, sir, same to you.

down in Cuba with the crazy beard.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.132
What about him?

55:14.210 --> 55:17.338
Because as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

55:17.414 --> 55:20.941
Two weeks ago, I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

55:21.017 --> 55:22.143
That so?

55:22.218 --> 55:25.847

was let Mickey out for Christmas.

you just don't sit down
at the breakfast table

This isn't like you, Fran.

56:54.344 --> 56:57.836

such fun to be with.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.422
At least you're speaking to me.

57:10.393 --> 57:13.794
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

57:13.863 --> 57:16.525
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

57:17.267 --> 57:19.394
You know, ring-a-ding-ding?

57:20.403 --> 57:23.133
I laughed so much, I like to have died.

57:23.573 --> 57:26.201
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen?

57:26.276 --> 57:28.210
That's ancient history.

57:28.378 --> 57:31.108
Well, I never was very good at history.

57:31.981 --> 57:36.418
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

57:36.553 --> 57:39.579
No, no. She came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

57:39.656 --> 57:40.645
Now, Fran...

57:40.723 --> 57:44.352
And just think,
right now some lucky girl in the building

57:44.427 --> 57:46.361
is going to come after me.

57:46.429 --> 57:48.192
Okay, okay, Fran.

57:48.264 --> 57:50.858
I guess I deserve that, but ask yourself,

57:50.934 --> 57:52.663
why does a man run around
with a lot of girls?

57:52.735 --> 57:56.603
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's Ionely, that's why.

57:57.440 --> 58:00.739
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

58:02.245 --> 58:04.406
How could I be so stupid?

58:04.481 --> 58:06.312
You'd think I would have learned by now.

58:06.382 --> 58:10.546
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

58:11.554 --> 58:14.580
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

58:17.093 --> 58:18.788
Merry Christmas.

58:18.862 --> 58:20.227
What is it?

58:25.134 --> 58:26.396
Oh.

58:26.503 --> 58:29.495
Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.
Thanks, Fran.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.705
We better keep it here.

58:32.775 --> 58:34.367
Yeah, we better.

58:35.078 --> 58:39.105
Oh, I have a present for you.
I didn't quite know what to get you.

58:39.182 --> 58:42.413
Besides, it's kind of awkward
for me shopping, so here's $100.

58:42.485 --> 58:44.953
You go and buy yourself something.

58:50.126 --> 58:53.289
They have some nice alligator bags
at Bergdorf's.

59:05.241 --> 59:07.004
Look, Fran, I didn't realize it was so late.

59:07.076 --> 59:09.408
It's quarter to 7:00.
I mustn't miss my train.

59:09.479 --> 59:13.210
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

59:14.617 --> 59:17.814
Okay. I just thought
as long as it was paid for.

59:18.588 --> 59:22.422
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.
Don't make yourself out to be cheap.

59:22.492 --> 59:25.017
$100? I don't call that cheap.

59:25.094 --> 59:27.062
And you must be paying
somebody something

59:27.130 --> 59:29.325
for the use of the apartment.

59:29.399 --> 59:30.889
Stop it, Fran.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.596
Yeah.

59:43.079 --> 59:44.671
Are you coming?

59:44.747 --> 59:47.716
No. You run along. I want to fix my face.

59:47.784 --> 59:50.378
Don't forget to kill the lights.
I'll see you Monday.

59:50.453 --> 59:54.514
Sure. Monday and Thursday,

59:54.591 --> 59:57.583
and Monday again and Thursday again.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.787
It won't always be like this, Fran.

all by himself in that jail in Havana...

- Would you like to see his picture?
- Not particularly.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:47.589
He's so cute. He's 5'2", 99 pounds,

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.784

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:06.558
Now you got it. One, two, three, four.

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:10.093
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.800
One, two, and return again.

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:16.208
And left, right, left, right.

01:15:23.118 --> 01:15:26.417
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:30.322
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:32.485
Just as long as she's okay.

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:35.587
These cases are harder on the doctor
than on the patient.

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:38.132
I ought to charge you by the mile.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.033
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

01:15:42.237 --> 01:15:44.467
How do you spell her last name?

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:46.736
Kubelik. Two "K's."

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.373
What's her address?

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.144
Where does she live?

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.578
Why do you want to know, Doc?

01:15:57.152 --> 01:16:00.178
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.815
But she didn't mean it, Doc.
It was an accident.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:05.359
She had a little too much to drink.
She didn't know what she was doing.

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.520
There was no suicide note or anything.

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:09.757
Believe me, Doc,
I'm not thinking about myself.

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:10.923
Aren't you?

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:14.264
It's just she's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:16.236
Look, Doc,
can't you forget you're a doctor?

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:18.296
Let's just say you're here as a neighbor.

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:21.342
Well, as a doctor,
I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.502
But as your neighbor,

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.808
I'd like to kick your keister
clear around the block.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.405
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:30.110
I don't know what you did to that girl
in there, and don't tell me,

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:32.847
but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:35.321
Live now, pay later. Diners Club.

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.919
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:41.827
Be a <i>mensch: </i> You know what that means?

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:44.866
- I'm not sure.
- A <i>mensch, </i> a human being.

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:47.927
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.061
(CHUCKLING) Wasn't I?

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:50.627
But you're not out
of the woods yet, Baxter,

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:53.106
because most of them try it again.

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.167
Well, you know where I am if you need me.

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:08.576
(DOORBELL RINGING)

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.919
Mr. Baxter, open up already.

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.346
Oh.

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:18.726
Mrs. Lieberman.

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:21.126
So who did you think it was?
Kriss Kringle?

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.221
What was going on here last night?

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:26.893
- Last night?
- All that marching. Tramp, tramp, tramp.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.799
You were having army maneuvers, maybe?

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.497
I'll never invite those people again.

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:32.506
What you get from renting to bachelors.

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:36.635
All night I didn't sleep 10 minutes,
and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:40.443
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss.
I happen to know he was out on a case.

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.449
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter.

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:45.509
This is a respectable house,
not a honky-tonky.

01:18:45.587 --> 01:18:47.077
Come on, Oscar.

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:18.779
Operator, I want White Plains, New York,
Mr. J.D. Sheldrake.

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.378
Make that person-to-person.

01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:30.254
Five, four, three, two, one, let her rip!

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.024
(PHONE RINGING)

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.600
I'll get the phone.

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.904
Dad, why don't we put a fly
in the nose cone,

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.371
see if we can bring it back alive?

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.998
Hey, that's a thought.

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:44.307
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:45.744
See if they'll what?

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:48.647
Propagate. You know, multiply.

01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:50.912
- Baby flies?
- Oh.

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:55.851
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:57.357
A Mr. Baxter.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.052
- Baxter?
- Person-to-person.

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.857
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.524
Hello. Yes. What's on your mind, Baxter?

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:06.925
I hate to disturb you,
but something came up.

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:08.970
It's rather important.
I think it would be a good idea

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:11.403
if you could see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.600
You're not making sense, Baxter.
What's this all about?

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:18.271
I didn't want to tell you over the phone,
but a certain party, you know who I mean,

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:22.572
I found her here last night.
She'd taken an overdose of sleeping pills.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.845
What?

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:29.089
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:32.593
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas day.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.788
Yes, Baxter.

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.956
Just how serious is it?

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:40.729
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:43.930
I thought maybe you'd like to be here
when she wakes up.

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:47.100
That's impossible. I...

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.507
You'll have to handle
this situation yourself, Baxter.

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.409
As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:55.506
Yes, sir. I understand. She left a letter.

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:58.485
Would you like me to open it
and read it to you?

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.953
It was just a suggestion.

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:03.084
No, you don't have to worry about that.

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.318
I kept your name out of it,

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:07.953
so there will be no trouble
police-wise or newspaper-wise.

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:13.534
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:16.093
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:19.270
No. He just jumped to the conclusion.

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:22.242
Around here,
I'm known as quite a ladies' man.

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:26.644
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.114
Yes, sir, I'll do my best.

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.947
It looks like it'll be a couple of days
before she's fully recovered.

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:34.216
And I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:37.988
All right, Mr. Sheldrake, I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:41.654
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.398
Well, I'll think of something.

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:47.566
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:51.461
I'm sorry.

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:54.364
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:56.740
Miss Kubelik,
what are you doing out of bed?

01:21:56.811 --> 01:22:00.178
I didn't know.
I had no idea this was your apartment.

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:02.148
Here. Let me help you.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.276
I'm so ashamed.

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.719
Why didn't you just let me die?

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:11.225
What kind of talk is that?
You got a little overemotional.

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:12.885
You're fine now.

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.250
Oh.

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:19.127
Oh, my head.
It feels just like a big wad of chewing gum.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.135
- What time is it?
- 2:00.

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:24.535
My dress. I have to go home.

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:27.006
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:29.873
- You don't want me here.
- Sure, I do.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.709
It's always nice to have company
for Christmas.

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.806
I'm stronger than you are, Miss Kubelik.

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:37.181
- I just want to brush my teeth.
- Oh.

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:40.387
Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:42.582
Here. Put that on.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:15.555
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:17.557
I'll fix you some coffee.

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:22.155
We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:23.891
Back in a minute.

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:36.141
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
I wonder if I could borrow some coffee,

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:37.940
and maybe an orange,
and a couple of eggs.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.779
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges!
What you need is a good horsewhipping.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:44.785
- Ma'am?
- From me, the doctor has no secrets.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.344
Poor girl.
How could you do a thing like that?

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:50.949
Please. I didn't do anything, honest.
It's just... I mean...

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:53.460
You take a girl out
a couple of times just for laughs,

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:56.497
and right away, she thinks
you're getting serious marriage-wise.

01:23:56.564 --> 01:24:00.159
Big shot. For you, I wouldn't lift a finger.

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:03.398
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:13.644
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.910
My sister.
She'll want to know what happened to me.

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:17.451
Wait a minute!

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:21.619
Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you going to tell her?

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.452
I haven't figured it out exactly.

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:25.857
Well, you better figure it out exactly.

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:29.055
Suppose she asks you
why you didn't come home last night.

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:30.961
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:33.262
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.097
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.638
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:40.003
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.543
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:46.073
- When are you coming home?
- As soon as I can walk.

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:48.342
- Something's wrong with your legs?
- No, my stomach.

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:51.408
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.818
Miss Kubelik,
I don't think you ought to call anybody,

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:56.356
not till you get the chewing gum
out of your head.

01:24:56.424 --> 01:24:57.789
They'll be worried about me.

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.793
My brother-in-law
might be calling the police.

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.921
That's why we have to be careful.
We don't want to involve anybody.

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:05.761
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:09.026
Thanks for reminding me.

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.775
I didn't mean it that way.

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:19.177
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.647
He doesn't give a damn about me.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.812
You're wrong. He told me...

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:27.321
He's a liar, and that's not the worst part.

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:30.781
The worst part is, I still love him.

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:33.358
(DOORBELL RINGING)

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:36.323
Oh, that must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:40.794
You remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:44.237
So where's the victim?

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.763
Max the knife.

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:54.371
<i>-Nu, </i> little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:56.815
Here. The best thing for dizzy
is a little noodle soup

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:59.945
with chicken, white meat and a glass tea.

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:01.682
No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:03.951
Go ahead. Eat. Enjoy.

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:07.385
You wouldn't have
such a thing as a napkin, would you?

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:10.795
- Well, I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:14.323
Go to my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, there is napkins.

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:15.960
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:18.505
So, what are you waiting for,
a singing commercial?

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:19.562
I can't eat.

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:23.577
You must eat, and you must get healthy,
and you must forget him.

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:27.712
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:30.683
Clean and cut, a regular Ivy Leaguer.

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:32.845
Turns out he's King Farouk

01:26:32.921 --> 01:26:37.255
with the drinking,
with the cha-cha, with the no napkins.

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:41.527
A girl like you, for the rest of your life,
you want to cry in your noodle soup?

01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:44.326
Who needs it? You listen to me.

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:48.563
You find yourself a nice, substantial man,
a widower maybe,

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:52.470
and settle down
instead of noshing all those sleeping pills.

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.600
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.338
(DOOR OPENS)

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:59.803
One napkin, coming up.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.849
I wish we had some champagne
to wrap it around.

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:03.577
What did I tell you?

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:06.119
Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.
I'll wash the dishes.

01:27:06.187 --> 01:27:09.281
You wash them, you break them.
I'll come back for them later.

01:27:09.357 --> 01:27:11.951
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:16.493
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:19.833
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:21.869
that anybody'd think a girl like you

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:25.030
would do a thing like this
over a guy like me.

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:28.937
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:31.139
Yes. I've got it.

01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:35.649
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:37.014
Open it.

01:27:41.756 --> 01:27:45.453
- There's nothing here but a $100 bill.
- That's right.

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:49.428
- Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
- Sure.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.468
Take this away, will you?

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:57.799
Would you like me
to move the television set in here?

01:27:57.872 --> 01:27:59.703
Do you play gin rummy?

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:02.368
- I'm not very good at it.
- I am. Let me get the cards.

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:05.003
You don't have to entertain me,
Mr. Baxter.

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:08.776
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know, togetherness.

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.579
Guess what I did last Christmas?

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:13.678
Had an early dinner at the automat,
went to the zoo,

01:28:13.755 --> 01:28:16.553
and then I came home
and cleaned up after Mr. Eichelberger.

01:28:16.624 --> 01:28:19.058
He had a little eggnog party here.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.924
So I'm way ahead this year.

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:25.191
Three across. Spades double. High deals.

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:28.727
Six. Eight.

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.870
I think I'm going to give it all up.

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:42.939
Give what up?

01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:49.322
Why do people have
to love people, anyway?

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.421
I know what you mean.

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.758
Nine, ten...

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:57.224
Queen.

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.334
I don't want it.

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:03.893
Pick a card.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:09.599
What do you call it when somebody

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:12.612
keeps getting smashed up
in automobile accidents?

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.614
A bad insurance risk?

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:16.479
That's me with men.

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:19.414
I was jinxed from the word go.

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:22.422
First time I was ever kissed
was in a cemetery.

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:23.821
Cemetery?

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:27.355
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.026
His name was George,

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:31.793
and he threw me over
for a drum majorette.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.297
Gin.

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:44.043
That's 10, 20, 36 and 25,
makes 61 and two boxes.

01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:47.513
I just have this talent
for falling in love with the wrong guy

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:50.176
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.711
How many guys were there?

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.082
Three.

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:58.255
The last one was the manager
of a finance company

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.850
back home in Pittsburgh.

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:01.895
They found a little shortage
in his accounts,

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:03.362
but he asked me to wait for him.

01:30:03.431 --> 01:30:05.296
He'll be out in 1965.

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:08.562
Cut.

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:13.130
I came to New York and moved in
with my sister and her husband.

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.799
He drives a cab.

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:17.276
They sent me to secretarial school,

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:20.314
and then I applied for a job
at Consolidated,

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:22.611
but I flunked the typing test.

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:25.618
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

01:30:25.686 --> 01:30:27.483
I just can't spell.

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:32.819
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator,

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:35.820
and that's how I met Jeff.

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:39.691
Oh, God, I'm so fouled-up.

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:42.594
What am I going to do now?

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:47.600
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:51.401
Was he very upset when you told him?

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.005
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah. Very.

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:56.411
Maybe he does love me,

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.952
only he doesn't have the nerve
to tell his wife.

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.612
I'm sure that's the explanation.

01:31:00.688 --> 01:31:03.486
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:07.588
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

01:31:07.662 --> 01:31:08.924
What for?

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.964
I'm going to write a letter
to Mrs. Sheldrake.

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:12.260
You what?

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:15.166
As one woman to another,
I'm sure she'll understand.

01:31:15.236 --> 01:31:17.568
I don't think that's a very good idea,
Miss Kubelik.

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:19.071
Why not?

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.971
For one thing, you can't spell.

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:24.876
Secondly, if you did something like that,
you'd hate yourself.

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.908
I don't like myself very much, anyway.

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:33.445
Pick up the cards and let's go.

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:36.615
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:45.960
- You really want to discard that?
- Sure.

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.526
Gin.

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:52.369
(MUFFLED WHISTLING)

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:58.073
Let's see. That's 20, 40, 52 and 25, 77.

01:31:58.145 --> 01:32:02.809

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:42.605
All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:51.922
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do you want?

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:54.018
What do I want? Just a minute.

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:55.323
You can't come in here!

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:59.025
What's the matter with you, Buddy-boy?
I made a reservation for 4:00, remember?

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.261
You can't stay here,
so take your champagne and go.

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:04.236
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was set.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:05.397
Do you want to make a liar out of me?

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:09.603
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

(KIRKEBY LAUGHING)

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:14.312
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?
You got yourself a little playmate, huh?

01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:16.179
Now will you get out?

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:25.121
Hey, come on. What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:26.523
Mildred.

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.590
What's holding things up?

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:33.429
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party,
the four of us?

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.661
No.

(KIRKEBY LAUGHING)

01:34:40.675 --> 01:34:42.199
Well, I don't blame you.

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:45.302
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean, Kubelik-wise.

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:48.246
Now don't worry,
I won't say a word to anybody.

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:50.306
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:06.656
Who was that?

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:10.128
Just somebody
delivering a bottle of champagne.

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:11.967
Would you like some?

01:35:12.606 --> 01:35:15.097
Would you mind opening that window?

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:20.814
Now don't go getting any ideas,
Miss Kubelik.

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:23.247
I just want some fresh air.

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:26.775
It's only one story down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:29.948
So they'll shoot me like a horse.

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:31.719
Please, Miss Kubelik,
you got to promise me

01:35:31.792 --> 01:35:33.384
you won't do anything foolish.

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:35.486
- Who'd care?
- I would!

01:35:41.969 --> 01:35:45.632
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice, like you?

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:52.012
Yeah. Well, that's just
the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:54.947
Go to sleep.

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:31.642
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Morning, Mr. Sheldrake.

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:34.882
Miss Olsen,
will you come into my office, please?

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:47.232
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help.

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.325
Me?

01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:51.303
Thank you for giving that little pep talk
to Miss Kubelik at the office party.

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:54.170
Oh, I'm sorry, Jeff.
You know, I never could hold my liquor.

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:56.038
Well, I thought
you could hold your tongue.

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.544
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:01.604
I'll arrange for you
to get a month's severance pay.

01:37:01.682 --> 01:37:04.617
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:08.216
You let me go four years ago, Jeff,

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:10.382
only you were cruel enough
to make me sit out there

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:12.652
and watch the new models pass by.

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:15.991
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here
as soon as you can

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.758
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake.

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:29.736
I'd like Mr. Baxter's
home telephone number.

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:33.610
That's C.C. Baxter,
and he's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

<i>BAXTER: Hello? </i>

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:54.660
<i>SHELDRAKE: Hello, Baxter: </i>
<i>Jeff Sheldrake: Can you talk? </i>

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:58.432
Yes. She's in the shower.
She's coming along fine, considering.

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:01.497
Good. Is there anything you need? Money?

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.167
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:06.213
As a matter of fact,
I have some money for you. $100.

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:07.302
Oh.

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:09.879
Well, if there's anything I can do for you...

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:12.043
For me? I don't think so.

01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:15.247
But I was hoping
maybe you could do something for her.

01:38:15.322 --> 01:38:18.655
Like what?
Put yourself in my place, Baxter.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.853
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:24.823
Well, at least you can talk to her.

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:29.327
Now, let me put her on.
And please, be gentle.

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:32.038
There's a call for you!

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:35.104
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:39.375
I don't want to talk to him.

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:43.473
I think you should.
I got to run down to the grocery anyway.

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:47.111
There's nothing left around here
but one frozen pizza.

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:49.445
I'll be right back, okay?

01:39:10.144 --> 01:39:11.577
Hello, Jeff.

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.107
Yes, I'm all right.

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:16.774
Why did you do it, Fran?

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:19.478
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:22.021
I ought to be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:24.057
But let's forget the whole thing.
Pretend it never happened.

01:39:24.124 --> 01:39:26.092
What do you say, Fran?

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:28.455
Fran?

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:31.460
<i>Are you there, Fran? </i>

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:38.497
Of course I'm not here.
Because the whole thing never happened.

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:42.338
I never took those pills. I never loved you.

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:44.138
We never even met.

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:47.470
Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:49.948
There you go again.
You know I didn't mean it that way, Fran.

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:51.848
You just get well.
Do what the nurse tells you.

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:55.047
I mean Baxter.
I'll see you as soon as I can.

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:56.612
Goodbye, Fran.

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:17.035
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake? This is Miss Olsen.

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.237
Fine, thank you.

01:40:18.312 --> 01:40:22.339
Mrs. Sheldrake, I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:25.908
Well, I don't know how important it is,
but I think you might find it educational.

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.977
It concerns your husband.

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:32.588
All right. 1:00,
Longchamp's, Madison and 59th.

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.198
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:43.463
Just making a personal call.

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:46.362
Here's a dime.

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:51.242
Going down.

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:06.454
Oh, Mr. Baxter, I'm glad you're here.

01:41:06.527 --> 01:41:09.155
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:12.198
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

01:41:12.266 --> 01:41:13.426
Gas?

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:23.275
(SNIFFING)

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:24.810
Miss Kubelik!

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:28.837
Miss Kubelik!

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.951
- You all right?
- Sure.

01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:38.217
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas. Didn't you turn it on?

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:41.386
Yes. I was boiling some water
to get the coffee stains out of my dress.

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.430
You turned it on, but you didn't light it.

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:47.228
- Are you supposed to?
- In this house, you're supposed to.

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:48.825
Hey, what are you doing with that?

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:50.164
Well, I was washing my stockings,

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:52.831
so I thought I might as well
wash your socks, too.

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:53.998
Thank you.

01:41:54.074 --> 01:41:56.770
It's very curious.
I could only find three-and-a-half pair.

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:59.506
Well, things are
a little disorganized around here.

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.979
I'd say.

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:03.448
What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:04.745
Tennis racket?

01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:08.413
Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:11.287
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:12.347
Why not?

01:42:12.426 --> 01:42:14.189
As a matter of fact,
I'm a pretty good cook,

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:15.990
only, I'm a lousy housekeeper.

01:42:16.063 --> 01:42:17.257
Yes, you are.

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:19.856
When I was straightening up the couch,
you know what I found?

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:22.731
Six hairpins, a lipstick,
a pair of false eyelashes,

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:25.499
and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:28.700
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

01:42:28.775 --> 01:42:30.606
I don't mean to girls. I mean...

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:33.077
You mean,
to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

01:42:33.147 --> 01:42:34.580
I guess so.

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:36.447
I know so.

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:39.409
He's a taker.

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:40.953
A what?

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:43.080
Some people take, some people get took,

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:47.287
and they know they're getting took,
and there's nothing they can do about it.

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:49.124
I wouldn't say that.

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:52.325
What would you like to have for dinner?

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:55.630
Hey. Onion soup and canned asparagus...

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.795
I really should be getting home.

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.463
My family will be flipping by now.

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:00.802
You can't leave yet.

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:04.935
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.572
I wonder how long it takes

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:10.981
to get someone you're stuck on
out of your system.

01:43:11.051 --> 01:43:13.918
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:16.421
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik.

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:19.755
You think it's the end of the world,
but it's not.

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:22.351
I went through
exactly the same thing myself.

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:24.420
- You did?
- Well, maybe not exactly the same.

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.329
I tried to do it with a gun.

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.129
- Over a girl?
- Worse than that.

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:31.433
It was the wife of my best friend,
and I was mad about her.

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:34.269
But I knew it was hopeless,
and I decided to end it all.

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:37.276
I went to a pawnshop
and bought a.45 automatic,

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:39.141
and I drove up to Eden Park...

01:43:39.213 --> 01:43:41.204
- You know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:43.772
Well, anyway, I parked the car
and loaded that gun.

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:46.683
You read in the papers all the time
that people shoot themselves?

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:48.618
Believe me, it's not that easy.

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:52.284
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

01:43:53.694 --> 01:43:55.389
You know where I finally shot myself?

01:43:55.462 --> 01:43:57.225
- Where?
- Here.

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:58.321
In the knee?

01:43:58.398 --> 01:44:01.026
Yeah. While I was sitting there
trying to make up my mind,

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:03.467
a cop stuck his head in the car
because I was illegally parked

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:07.029
and I tried to hide the gun
under the seat, and it went off.

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.438
That's terrible.

01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:10.999
It was a year
before I could bend the knee,

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:13.979
but I got over the girl in three weeks.

01:44:15.716 --> 01:44:19.277
She still lives in Cincinnati,
has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:22.083
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

01:44:22.155 --> 01:44:24.623
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

01:44:24.691 --> 01:44:26.420
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:29.257
- Do you want to see my knee?
- No, thank you.

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:32.230
The fellas in the office
might get the wrong idea how I found out.

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:33.425
Let them.

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.990
Look, I'm going to cook dinner
for us tonight

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:36.797
and you have the fruitcake for dessert.

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:40.101
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

01:44:40.173 --> 01:44:41.538
Yes, nurse.

I'm looking for one of the elevator girls,
Miss Kubelik.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:02.857
So am I. She didn't report this morning.

01:45:02.929 --> 01:45:04.226
- She didn't?
- No.

Where can I get some information?
Who's in charge here?

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:08.558
Well, that comes under

So yesterday afternoon,
I take Sylvia up to the apartment,

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:19.638
and guess who
he's got stashed away in the bedroom.

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:21.044
- Who?
- Kubelik.

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:24.413
No kidding? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having themselves a little toot.

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:27.282
Toot? More like a lost weekend.

showed up for work today.

were guzzling my champagne

at the Guggenheim Museum.

- Fran Kubelik.
- Miss Kubelik?

- You know her?
- Of course.

There may be a lot of employees here,
but we're one big, happy family.

Well, she lives with us
and my wife is getting pretty nervous

for the past two days.

Anyway, we was wondering
if somebody in the office

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.615
knew what happened to her.

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:02.916

among eight million people

I saw a footprint in the sand,

and there you were.

- You usually eat alone?
- Oh, no.

Sometimes, I have dinner with Ed Sullivan,
sometimes Dinah Shore or Perry Como.

01:47:46.193 --> 01:47:48.058
The other night,
I had dinner with Mae West.

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:50.119

she was much younger then. Cheers.

we're going to do after dinner?

- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

- You don't have to if you don't want to.

- We're going to finish the gin game.

happens to think you're a lady.

and wash the dishes.

if there wasn't a lady present,

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:41.680
- I'd clobber you.
- All right, Karl!

01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:44.869
Not that kind of doctor.

01:49:44.945 --> 01:49:46.970
He just gave her a shot
and pumped out her stomach.

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:48.947
- What for?
- Because I took some sleeping pills,

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:50.380
but I'm all right now, so let's go.

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:53.044
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:54.279
You?

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.520
Who else?

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:03.556
Leave him alone!

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:09.564
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:13.296
MATUSCHKA: Come on, Fran.

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:15.170
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:22.306
Goodbye, Doctor.

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:26.719
Well, I don't want to gloat,

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:29.778
but just between us,
you had it coming to you.

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:31.685
(TSKING)

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:34.056
You're going to have a shiner tomorrow.

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.555
Let me get my bag.

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:40.593
Don't bother, Doc.

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.693
It doesn't hurt a bit.

01:51:05.058 --> 01:51:07.083
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C. Baxter.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:09.424
Would you please tell Mr. Sheldrake
I'd like to come up and see him?

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:10.622
It's rather important.

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:12.631
Will you call me back, please?

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:18.730
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:21.866
All your troubles are over.

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:26.135
I'm going to take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:29.375
The plain fact is, I love her.

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:32.813
I haven't told her yet. I thought that
you should be the first to know.

01:51:32.886 --> 01:51:35.878
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do,

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:40.051
and although it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:42.219
So I think it would be
the best thing all around,

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:43.762
(PHONE RINGING)

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:45.191
solution-wise.

01:51:45.265 --> 01:51:46.527
Yes?

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.226
I'll be right up.

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:52.338
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

01:51:52.405 --> 01:51:54.236
All your troubles are over.

01:51:58.878 --> 01:52:00.243
Nineteen.

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:03.339
Hiya, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?

01:52:03.416 --> 01:52:06.510
Hit by a swinging door?
Or maybe a yellow cab?

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:08.019
That guy really must have belted him.

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:10.750
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

01:52:11.491 --> 01:52:12.856
Twenty-seven.

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:15.724
You see, Mr. Sheldrake,
those two days she spent in the apartment

01:52:15.795 --> 01:52:18.787
have made me realize
how Ionely I'd been before.

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:22.357
Thanks to you,
I'm in a financial position to marry her.

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:25.632
If I can ever square things
with her family.

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:27.798
Good morning. C.C. Baxter.

01:52:29.142 --> 01:52:30.302
(BUZZING)

01:52:31.978 --> 01:52:34.344
<i>-WOMAN: Mr: Baxter is here: </i>
- Send him in.

01:52:36.549 --> 01:52:39.313
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

01:52:39.385 --> 01:52:41.546
I've got good news for you, Baxter.

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:44.215
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:46.520
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik.

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:50.586
Well, stop worrying.
I'm going to take her off your hands.

01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:52.392
You're going to take her off my hands?

01:52:52.465 --> 01:52:55.662
That's right, Baxter.
I've moved out of the house.

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:59.962
I'm going to be staying in town
at the athletic club.

01:53:00.039 --> 01:53:01.404
You left your wife?

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:03.339
If you must know, I fired my secretary,

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:06.105
my secretary got to my wife,
and my wife fired me.

01:53:06.179 --> 01:53:09.080
- Ain't that a kick in the head?
- Yeah.

01:53:10.016 --> 01:53:12.246
Now, what's your news, Baxter?

01:53:13.953 --> 01:53:15.079
It's about Miss Kubelik.

01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:17.885
She's feeling all right again
so she went back home.

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:20.983
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.687
This way, Baxter.

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:29.001
Sit down. Try it on for size.

01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:32.537
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:34.869
My assistant, Roy Thompson,
has been shifted to the Denver office,

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:37.068
and you're taking his place.

01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:40.641
What's the matter, Baxter?
You don't seem very excited.

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:44.911
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:47.680
I'm very pleased,
especially for Miss Kubelik.

01:53:47.754 --> 01:53:50.416
Now that I've gotten to know her better,
I think she's the kind of girl

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:53.015
that definitely ought to be married
to someone.

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:54.753
Well, sure, sure.

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:56.762
First the property settlement
has to be worked out

01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:58.627
and then it takes six weeks in Reno.

01:53:58.698 --> 01:54:01.394
Meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.094
Oh, by the way, Baxter,
you now can have lunch

01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:05.228
- In the executive dining room.
- Yes, sir.

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:08.240
That's just one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

01:54:08.308 --> 01:54:11.835
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

01:54:12.846 --> 01:54:15.337
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:17.849
- I got kicked in the head, too.
- Oh.

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:41.400
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

01:54:41.474 --> 01:54:44.238
Oh, Miss Kubelik.

01:54:45.178 --> 01:54:46.770
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:48.871
- How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

01:54:48.948 --> 01:54:51.610
- How's everything at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

01:54:51.684 --> 01:54:53.618
You know,
we never did finish that gin game.

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:54.948
I know.

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:58.820
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:01.520
You mean leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:02.925
I never thought he'd do it.

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:06.898
I told you all along.
See, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.

01:55:06.966 --> 01:55:08.126
I guess so.

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:10.135
For that matter,
you were wrong about me, too.

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:13.263
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

01:55:13.339 --> 01:55:15.933
Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him.

01:55:16.009 --> 01:55:19.843
See? Last month,
I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor.

01:55:19.913 --> 01:55:23.542
Now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor,
paneled office, three windows.

01:55:23.616 --> 01:55:26.915
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we want.

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:29.784
Yes. You walking to the subway?

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:32.416
No, thank you. Well, I...

01:55:32.492 --> 01:55:35.723
To tell you the truth,
I have this heavy date for tonight.

01:55:37.931 --> 01:55:38.955
Oh.

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:41.159
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No.

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:42.462
You know how people talk,

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:44.799
so I decided it would be better
if we didn't see each other

01:55:44.871 --> 01:55:48.068
until after everything was settled,
divorce-wise.

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:49.631
That's very wise.

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:53.635
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

01:56:29.649 --> 01:56:31.583
Baxter, would you mind
stepping in here for a minute?

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:33.016
<i>BAXTER: Yes, Mr: Sheldrake: </i>

01:56:33.086 --> 01:56:35.316
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:39.418
Here's a breakdown
of figures on personnel turnover.

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:43.019
37% of our female employees
leave to get married, and 22%...

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:44.427
Baxter, you're working too hard.

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:46.863
- It's New Year's Eve. Relax.
- Yes, sir.

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:49.333
Well, I suppose you'll be
out on the town tonight, celebrating.

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:51.427
- Naturally.
- Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

01:56:51.504 --> 01:56:53.836
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

01:56:53.906 --> 01:56:56.101
The only thing is, Baxter,
I'm staying at the athletic club,

01:56:56.175 --> 01:56:59.144
and it's strictly stag,
so if you don't mind...

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.838
Don't mind what?

01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:04.906
You know, the other key
to your apartment.

01:57:04.984 --> 01:57:07.077
Well, when we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik,

01:57:07.153 --> 01:57:08.484
I thought I'd better get rid of it quick,

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:11.216
so I threw it out the window
of the commuter train.

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:12.382
Very clever.

01:57:12.458 --> 01:57:14.983
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:17.924
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.

01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:19.089
What do you mean, sorry?

01:57:19.165 --> 01:57:21.599
You're not going to bring
anybody to my apartment.

01:57:21.667 --> 01:57:23.794
I'm not just bringing anybody,
I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.

01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:26.168
Especially not Miss Kubelik.

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:28.537
- How's that again?
- No key.

01:57:31.144 --> 01:57:33.009
Baxter, I picked you for my team

01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:36.014
because I thought
you were a very bright young man.

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:39.540
Do you realize what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:43.111
Normally, it takes years to work
your way up to the twenty-seventh floor.

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:46.124
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:47.523
You dig?

01:57:48.261 --> 01:57:49.489
I dig.

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:52.187
So what's it going to be?

01:57:59.038 --> 01:58:00.835
Now you're being bright.

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:02.397
Thank you, sir.

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:22.289
- Say, Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:24.989
This is the key to the executive washroom.

01:58:25.064 --> 01:58:26.292
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake.

01:58:26.365 --> 01:58:28.959
I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:30.366
What's gotten into you, Baxter?

01:58:30.436 --> 01:58:33.997
Just following doctor's orders.
I've decided to become a <i>mensch: </i>

01:58:34.073 --> 01:58:36.837
You know what that means?
A human being.

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:38.740
- Now, hold on, Baxter...
- Save it.

01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:40.938
The old payola won't work anymore.

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:42.913
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:14.477
(DOORBELL RINGING)

01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:21.511
Say, Baxter, we're having a little party.
We ran out of ice. I was wondering...

01:59:21.587 --> 01:59:22.611
Sure, Doc.

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:24.918
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:26.891
Well, I got things to do.

01:59:26.959 --> 01:59:30.656
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:33.225
Where are you moving to?

01:59:33.299 --> 01:59:36.427
I don't know.
All I know is, I got to get out of this place.

01:59:36.502 --> 01:59:38.561
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

01:59:38.638 --> 01:59:42.369
Me? You mean my body.
Don't worry, it'll go to the university, Doc.

01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:43.703
I'll put it in writing.

01:59:43.776 --> 01:59:46.802
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze, we don't need.

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.813
Say, why don't you join us?

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:50.178
We got two brain surgeons,

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:52.649
an ear, nose and throat specialist,
a proctologist,

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:54.185
and three nurses from Bellevue.

01:59:54.253 --> 01:59:55.948
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

01:59:56.022 --> 01:59:58.388
Look, Doc, in case I don't see you again,

01:59:58.457 --> 02:00:00.652
how much do I owe you
for taking care of that girl?

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:04.526
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbor.

02:00:04.597 --> 02:00:07.191
By the way, whatever happened to her?

02:00:08.568 --> 02:00:11.469
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

02:00:11.537 --> 02:00:13.095
Goodbye, Doc.

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:14.662
Happy New Year.

(CHATTERING)

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.847
Sorry I took so long on the phone,
but we're all set.

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:02.547
- All set for what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at 1:00.

02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:05.523
- We're driving down to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:07.650
Oh, I know it's a drag,
but you can't find a hotel room in town.

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:09.661
Not on New Year's Eve.

02:01:11.397 --> 02:01:15.595
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.
Ring-a-ding-ding.

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:20.472
I didn't plan it this way, Fran.
Actually, it's all Baxter's fault.

02:01:20.539 --> 02:01:21.597
Baxter?

02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:24.609
He wouldn't give me the key
to the apartment.

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:27.972
- He wouldn't?
- He just walked out on me. Quit.

02:01:28.047 --> 02:01:30.777
Threw that big fat job right in my face.

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:34.016
The nerve.

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:36.611
Yeah, that little punk.
After all I did for him.

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:38.486
Said I couldn't
bring anybody to the apartment,

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:40.684
especially not Miss Kubelik.

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.387
What's he got against you, anyway?

02:01:44.263 --> 02:01:46.231
I don't know.

02:01:46.299 --> 02:01:49.757
I guess that's the way it crumbles,
cookie-wise.

02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:54.131
What are you talking about?

02:01:55.574 --> 02:01:58.600
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

02:02:03.883 --> 02:02:09.082
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:14.252
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

02:02:15.294 --> 02:02:16.852
Happy New Year, Fran.

02:02:16.929 --> 02:02:19.454
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

02:02:19.532 --> 02:02:24.731
<i>And days o'auld lang syne</i>

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:29.969
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

02:02:30.042 --> 02:02:35.207
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:40.685
<i>We'll take a cup o'kindness yet</i>

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:46.521
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

02:02:46.826 --> 02:02:50.159
(CHEERING)

02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:59.130
Fran?

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:02.799
Where are you, Fran?

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:20.152
(LOUD BANG)

02:03:21.494 --> 02:03:22.961
Mr. Baxter!

02:03:23.829 --> 02:03:25.319
Mr. Baxter!

02:03:25.398 --> 02:03:28.629
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

02:03:31.303 --> 02:03:32.292
Oh.

02:03:32.872 --> 02:03:35.340
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

02:03:36.142 --> 02:03:38.440
Are you sure? How's your knee?

02:03:39.412 --> 02:03:41.175
I'm fine all over.

02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:46.278
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:52.614
Let me get another glass.

02:03:55.628 --> 02:03:56.890
Where are you going?

02:03:56.962 --> 02:04:00.728
Who knows? Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

02:04:01.333 --> 02:04:02.925
I'm on my own.

02:04:03.736 --> 02:04:05.636
That's funny. So am I.

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:10.142
- What did you do with the cards?
- In there.

02:04:22.755 --> 02:04:25.087
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

02:04:25.157 --> 02:04:28.354
I'm going to send him a fruitcake
every Christmas.

02:04:30.663 --> 02:04:31.721
Cut.

02:04:34.366 --> 02:04:36.391
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:39.530
Three. Queen.

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:44.175
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:48.607
Shut up and deal.
