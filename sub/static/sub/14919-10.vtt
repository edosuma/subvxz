WEBVTT

00:02.445 --> 00:04.450
Yes, I know it's the 22nd,

00:04.451 --> 00:07.609
but you must have an extra
organic free-range turkey

00:07.655 --> 00:09.413
flapping around there somewhere.

00:10.145 --> 00:11.457
Okay, I'll hold on.

00:12.109 --> 00:12.884
You're up early.

00:12.885 --> 00:14.438
Well, not early enough.

00:14.861 --> 00:17.501
I forgot the powdered sugar
for the pfeffernussen.

00:17.714 --> 00:19.492
Pfeffer-what? 
Nussen. Pfeffernussen

00:19.493 --> 00:20.059
ah.

00:20.060 --> 00:23.569
Yeah, they're Kevin's
absolute favorite cookie.

00:23.570 --> 00:26.504
Oh, he's had such a
stressful time lately...

00:26.505 --> 00:30.166
With this whole foster adoption thing.
Oh, thank you.

00:30.324 --> 00:32.296
I just wanted to make...

00:33.034 --> 00:34.092
mulling spices.

00:34.093 --> 00:36.173
Mulling spices for the hot wine.

00:36.249 --> 00:38.761
This is Kitty's first year without Robert,

00:38.762 --> 00:41.084
and we have to keep her good and mulled.

00:41.085 --> 00:42.012
What?

00:42.288 --> 00:43.981
Oh. All right. Listen,

00:44.399 --> 00:47.103
can... can you wrangle me up a goose?

00:47.157 --> 00:49.269
A great big one. Yeah.

00:49.462 --> 00:51.259
Okay, good. Well, then call me back.

00:51.884 --> 00:53.333
You forgot to worry about Justin.

00:53.334 --> 00:57.305
No, I didn't.
I made him a big batch of ginger...

00:59.706 --> 01:00.698
Oh!

01:01.185 --> 01:02.145
Oh.

01:07.027 --> 01:08.834
My gingerbread people.

01:09.397 --> 01:10.952
I incinerated them.

01:13.877 --> 01:15.836
I can't do this. Why am I even bothering

01:15.837 --> 01:18.622
with his huge, over-the-top extravaganza

01:18.623 --> 01:20.193
when I know the kids are dreading it?

01:20.194 --> 01:22.448
They're... they're probably
making fun of me right now

01:22.449 --> 01:25.042
for how I cram Christmas
down their throats.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.383
For 2 cents, I'd Chuck it all
and... and... and... and what?

01:28.428 --> 01:30.411
I don't know. If I knew, maybe I'd do it.

01:30.597 --> 01:33.652
Okay. Then, uh... close your eyes

01:33.653 --> 01:36.182
and visualize what it is
you'd rather be doing.

01:39.074 --> 01:40.368
It's Santa.

01:40.746 --> 01:42.361
Hey, hey, it's Santa.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.913
Oh, yeah. Apparently he has a fondness

01:44.914 --> 01:46.677
for a shot of cognac in his cappuccino.

01:46.678 --> 01:47.624
Would one of you take a
picture of me with him?

01:47.625 --> 01:49.848
Oh, no, no, no, no. Rein it in, Rudolph.

01:49.849 --> 01:51.457
He's working at the Christmas
fair down the street.

01:51.458 --> 01:53.101
Let him get drunk in peace.

01:53.102 --> 01:56.217
Oh, look, it's a Christmas
card from Joan and Jesse.

01:56.218 --> 01:59.119
Let me see. Oh, my gosh.
You know, that could be us next year?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.664
Our very own little Christmas
card family. Saul?

02:03.941 --> 02:04.868
Jonathan?

02:04.874 --> 02:07.100
Oh, my God. How are you?

02:07.101 --> 02:08.888
Jonathan, hi. How are you?

02:08.889 --> 02:11.364
It's been a long time. Yeah, yeah.
You're looking good.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.750
Thanks. Thank you. So are you.

02:13.858 --> 02:14.784
I wish I could stay and talk,

02:14.785 --> 02:17.106
but I'm late for the
"messiah" at Disney hall.

02:18.118 --> 02:20.821
Uh, will you call me? Y-yeah, I will.

02:21.077 --> 02:23.493
Great. Well, merry Christmas.

02:23.494 --> 02:25.445
Merry Christmas.
Hope to hear from you soon.

02:29.486 --> 02:33.100
Hallelujah hallelujah

02:33.181 --> 02:37.349
hallelujah, hallelujah hallelujah

02:37.350 --> 02:39.509
hallelujah

02:39.621 --> 02:41.105
as resilient as the radio station has been

02:41.162 --> 02:43.923
over the last year, all my
research is telling me that...

02:43.924 --> 02:47.349
Guys, could we turn this music
down, like, way down, please?

02:48.944 --> 02:52.036
My research is telling me that
we can attract bigger sponsors

02:52.037 --> 02:55.668
if we switch out drive time
from arts and "entertainment"

02:55.669 --> 02:57.797
to weather, traffic, news.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.513
So there's gonna be a few changes...

03:01.944 --> 03:02.737
Effective immediately.

03:02.738 --> 03:05.096
If you're firing me three
days before Christmas,

03:05.097 --> 03:07.160
can I call my wife and tell her to return

03:07.161 --> 03:08.591
the adorable little one-eyed puppy

03:08.592 --> 03:10.981
that we bought my daughter,
who's just been diagnosed...

03:10.982 --> 03:12.941
Very funny, Frank. You're hilarious.

03:13.029 --> 03:14.811
But, no, you don't get away that easily.

03:14.812 --> 03:16.986
There are some staff reductions, however,

03:16.987 --> 03:18.520
that I'm gonna ask you to make

03:18.521 --> 03:20.301
as a hedge against another downturn.

03:23.106 --> 03:24.195
Oh, God.

03:24.196 --> 03:26.456
Who put nutmeg in the coffee?

03:26.457 --> 03:28.731
Not feeling the x-mas spirit this year?

03:31.150 --> 03:33.448
And your kids are in Mexico
snorkeling with their dad.

03:33.449 --> 03:35.262
I swear, if I hear another bell jingle,

03:35.263 --> 03:38.749
I am gonna strangle an elf.
You can take care of that?

03:41.498 --> 03:45.081
Great. It's mom.
Let the Christmas pageant begin.

03:45.121 --> 03:46.904
Frank, if you need me
over the next three days,

03:46.905 --> 03:48.053
I'm gonna be at my mother's,

03:48.054 --> 03:50.644
stringing Cranberries on dental floss.

03:53.216 --> 03:54.499
Excuse me, nurse.

03:56.490 --> 03:57.629
I was wondering

03:57.630 --> 04:00.283
if you had anything for
a guilty conscience.

04:00.526 --> 04:03.645
Uh, no. I don't believe
there's a cure for that yet.

04:03.901 --> 04:05.068
Just gotta live with it.

04:06.350 --> 04:07.190
Ooh.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.592
So what brings you here, Justin?

04:09.593 --> 04:11.977
Actually, I'm here to see you.

04:15.261 --> 04:16.333
What's so funny?

04:16.755 --> 04:20.945
Well, considering it's been, what...
over a month,

04:21.002 --> 04:22.473
I mean, I don't know,
why don't you tell me?

04:22.846 --> 04:26.048
Yeah, look, I'm sorry.
I-I know I should've called.

04:26.049 --> 04:29.339
I, um, I've just been busy
trying to be a paramedic,

04:29.340 --> 04:30.861
and, um... You're gonna be a paramedic?

04:31.922 --> 04:32.757
Mm.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.612
Oh, great.

04:38.377 --> 04:39.609
What, bad news?

04:39.705 --> 04:43.305
No, emergency Christmas
meeting at my mom's.

04:43.329 --> 04:47.172
Here comes the creamed onions,
and the frosted window panes,

04:47.173 --> 04:49.617
and the little train that
goes through the village.

04:51.626 --> 04:53.141
Look, Annie, I'm s... I'm sorry.

04:53.142 --> 04:54.551
I mean it. I know I flaked,

04:54.552 --> 04:57.497
and I'd really love a second chance, so...

04:59.561 --> 05:00.164
If you're up for it,

05:00.165 --> 05:02.100
I'd really love to hear from you.

05:06.544 --> 05:07.905
Will there be figgy pudding?

05:09.337 --> 05:10.234
Figgy what?

05:10.593 --> 05:11.475
Pudding.

05:12.434 --> 05:15.474
At your family's Christmas, is
there gonna be figgy pudding?

05:15.498 --> 05:17.172
Oh, uh, figgy pudding. Yeah.

05:17.173 --> 05:18.281
Yeah, of course there's
gonna be figgy pudding.

05:18.282 --> 05:20.201
My mom makes figgy pudding. Really?

05:20.202 --> 05:22.265
Yeah, she, like, wins awards and stuff.

05:22.549 --> 05:24.709
You know what?
That sounds really wonderful actually.

05:25.165 --> 05:27.099
I've... I've always wanted
a Christmas like that.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.892
You know, like the old movies?

05:30.641 --> 05:31.953
Well, do you have plans?

05:32.509 --> 05:35.473
Well, if I had plans,
would I have basically

05:35.474 --> 05:38.289
just invited myself to
your family Christmas?

05:40.225 --> 05:42.370
Mm. Mm.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.887
I can't remember the last
time I had sex on a futon.

05:47.377 --> 05:49.762
Um, yesterday.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.628
Right.

05:51.629 --> 05:52.913
And the day before that.

05:52.914 --> 05:54.849
Mm-hmm. All right.

05:54.923 --> 05:55.931
I get it.

05:56.196 --> 05:57.575
Oh, what did... Where is it?

05:58.329 --> 05:59.656
Oh.

06:00.373 --> 06:01.929
Oh, wow. Look at that.

06:01.930 --> 06:06.057
My mother's discovered texting
just in time for the holidays.

06:07.981 --> 06:09.179
My mother's christmases

06:09.180 --> 06:12.191
are like the opening ceremonies
for the winter Olympics.

06:12.192 --> 06:13.552
Mm.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.704
Mm. How about you?

06:17.321 --> 06:18.892
Um, y-you know,

06:18.893 --> 06:20.884
there's probably, uh,
something I should tell you

06:20.885 --> 06:22.917
about... home.

06:22.918 --> 06:25.472
Um, I-I haven't yet
because I thought that...

06:25.473 --> 06:26.548
Shh. Shh. Don't.

06:27.632 --> 06:29.201
I like the mystery.

06:30.049 --> 06:31.301
Does that work for you?

06:31.302 --> 06:33.077
It's probably better that way.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.935
I spoke to human resources a
week ago about that list.

06:39.936 --> 06:41.947
Could somebody please just e-mail it to me?

06:41.948 --> 06:44.816
Thank you. Kiss me.
I'm under the mistletoe.

06:44.817 --> 06:47.265
Oh, well, look up, frosty.
There ain't no mistletoe.

06:47.266 --> 06:49.364
And there's no swagging on the banister

06:49.365 --> 06:51.289
and no pinecone wreath. And

06:51.290 --> 06:53.611
the Christmas tree is just
standing there, naked.

06:53.612 --> 06:55.365
What? What about the village and the train?

06:55.366 --> 06:56.445
Not even unpacked yet.

06:56.446 --> 06:58.879
What?! Good, good, good. You're all here.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.317
What's going on, mom?
Yeah, you're cutting it a little close.

07:01.318 --> 07:02.927
Oh, you have no idea. I can't believe

07:02.928 --> 07:04.546
we got a flight out tonight.
I hope we make it.

07:04.547 --> 07:08.738
Oh, no. We're not all flying
to the north pole, are we? Aw.

07:08.790 --> 07:11.444
Oh, my God. No. This isn't easy.

07:11.445 --> 07:13.752
Um... well, you know how busy I've been,

07:13.753 --> 07:15.696
and Karl and I have not been able

07:15.697 --> 07:17.445
to spend as much time
together as we would like,

07:17.496 --> 07:19.818
and we all like Karl, don't we?

07:21.857 --> 07:23.329
I'll take that as a yes.

07:23.904 --> 07:24.882
So I...

07:25.181 --> 07:26.908
Mom, just spit it out.

07:26.909 --> 07:28.050
Seriously. Yeah.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.514
I'm not having Christmas this year.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.401
I'm going to Santa Fe with Karl.

07:35.409 --> 07:35.869
W...

07:35.870 --> 07:38.087
I know. It just seems
rash and... and impulsive,

07:38.088 --> 07:40.304
but I've always dreamed of
spending Christmas there,

07:40.305 --> 07:42.056
with the snow and the little candles

07:42.057 --> 07:43.720
in the paper bags on the rooftops.

07:43.721 --> 07:45.040
I know it sounds like a fire hazard,

07:45.041 --> 07:46.881
but it looks so beautiful in the magazines,

07:46.882 --> 07:49.284
and I'm sure you will all
have a much better time

07:49.285 --> 07:52.628
without me around being all me.

07:53.464 --> 07:55.188
There he is. I have to go.

07:55.189 --> 07:58.575
So... the decorations are all
stacked in the living room.

07:58.576 --> 08:00.384
Take whatever you want, and
if you have a problem,

08:00.385 --> 08:02.440
one single problem, then call me.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.161
I will have my cell phone
with me every second.

08:08.850 --> 08:09.890
Okay.

08:15.143 --> 08:16.120
Here I go.

08:18.308 --> 08:19.508
I love you all.

08:21.264 --> 08:22.449
Merry Christmas.

08:28.289 --> 08:29.952
Hmm. I...

08:31.897 --> 08:33.179
Did she just...

08:33.181 --> 08:34.753
Cancel Christmas?

08:34.754 --> 08:36.600
Oh, frankly, I'm relieved.

08:36.601 --> 08:38.440
What kind of mother would do that?

08:38.568 --> 08:39.772
I'm gonna get back to the office.

08:39.773 --> 08:42.159
You guys figure out what you
want to do, and I'll be there.

08:43.089 --> 08:46.097
Talk about coal in your stocking.
Wait a minute.

08:47.251 --> 08:50.854
Maybe this is a good thing, guys.

08:51.574 --> 08:55.372
Maybe it's time for us to start
building our own traditions.

08:55.373 --> 08:58.569
I mean, maybe you guys should
all come over to my house.

08:58.846 --> 09:00.893
Yeah! I'm gonna get a tree.

09:00.894 --> 09:02.613
I'm gonna make a turkey. I...
You know what, Kitty?

09:02.614 --> 09:03.943
You don't have to go to all that trouble.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.630
Oh, no, no, no, no, it's no trouble at all.

09:05.631 --> 09:07.372
Yeah, you know, your house... I don't know.

09:07.373 --> 09:09.911
It's kind of... modern.
Our place is perfect.

09:09.912 --> 09:11.044
Okay, let's figure this out, guys.

09:11.045 --> 09:12.028
I have a lot riding on it.

09:12.029 --> 09:15.264
No, Kevin, I really want
to have it at my house.

09:15.265 --> 09:17.608
Why? You always make fun of
the way mom does Christmas.

09:17.609 --> 09:20.325
I do not. You do.
Look, let's just do it at mine.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.533
It'll be bigger, better,
brighter... Better?

09:23.225 --> 09:24.441
Well, look, I mean...

09:24.442 --> 09:25.204
Wow. No.

09:25.205 --> 09:26.693
Okay, no. I'm going home.

09:26.869 --> 09:30.039
No, Kit, I didn't mean "better
," like mine would be better...

09:30.040 --> 09:32.496
We'll talk about it tomorrow, Kevin.
Kit.

09:32.497 --> 09:35.199
No. "Better," Kevin? Wow.
I don't care who does it.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.488
Please have some figgy
freakin' pudding there.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:47.341 --> 09:49.099
Kitty, I'm sorry. I didn't mean better.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.525
I just meant different.

09:51.152 --> 09:53.820
But I still think we should all come here.

09:53.821 --> 09:56.316
Well, it's too late, Kevin.
I already got a tree.

09:56.317 --> 09:59.949
You know what? We just bought two. Oh. Ah!

10:00.160 --> 10:01.700
Oh. What was that?

10:01.701 --> 10:04.580
Uh, nothing. Nothing. And guess what else.

10:04.581 --> 10:07.361
I found a caterer who works on Christmas.

10:07.362 --> 10:08.772
I have one word for you...
Scotty.

10:08.773 --> 10:11.254
Okay, fine. So we're at an impasse.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.337
We're gonna let Sarah decide

10:13.338 --> 10:15.337
because she's the oldest.

10:15.401 --> 10:16.481
Sarah isn't exactly

10:16.482 --> 10:19.265
the grand master of the
Christmas parade this year.

10:20.157 --> 10:23.246
Oh. Um, I gotta go. Well...

10:24.787 --> 10:25.777
Ugh.

10:29.705 --> 10:30.729
Hi. Hey.

10:30.874 --> 10:35.225
Hi. Hi, so... there it is.

10:36.114 --> 10:37.763
After the church of Loretto,

10:37.764 --> 10:40.645
we can hit the palace of governors,

10:40.741 --> 10:42.669
which, according to this, is the oldest

10:42.670 --> 10:46.464
continuously occupied public
space in north America.

10:46.465 --> 10:48.739
Huh. Funny. I thought that was my kitchen.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.337
I just remembered...

10:51.338 --> 10:54.633
The mold for the cranberry
ring isn't in the kitchen.

10:54.941 --> 10:57.009
It's under the philodendron
on the back porch.

10:57.010 --> 10:58.644
Kevin's never gonna find it.
I better call him.

10:58.645 --> 11:01.373
Nora, Kevin has a perfectly
good pair of eyes in his head.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.261
He's okay. Mmm.

11:04.074 --> 11:05.860
Oh, Karl, this is really wonderful.

11:05.861 --> 11:08.309
It's exactly as I visualized it...

11:08.349 --> 11:09.589
Snow on the windows,

11:09.590 --> 11:14.056
you and me and...
not a candied yam in sight.

11:15.429 --> 11:18.933
So... in 1680,

11:18.997 --> 11:21.205
the pueblo people rose up

11:21.206 --> 11:25.462
and slaughtered 380 spaniards, plus...

11:25.941 --> 11:28.385
slaughtered, slaughtered.
No, they can't get a turkey.

11:28.386 --> 11:30.373
They're gonna have to go with a goose.
Nora, Nora.

11:30.374 --> 11:31.265
I thought we were just gonna

11:31.266 --> 11:34.369
leave all that behind.
Okay? Well, yeah, but...

11:34.370 --> 11:36.588
They're fine. If they needed
you, they would've called,

11:36.589 --> 11:37.918
and they haven't, right?

11:38.394 --> 11:40.761
No, they haven't.

11:40.889 --> 11:43.530
Now... let's get back to the spaniards.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.913
Nothing like a good massacre

11:45.914 --> 11:47.108
to put you in the Christmas spirit.

11:47.109 --> 11:47.612
There you go.

11:47.613 --> 11:50.749
My mother insists on doing
this strand by strand.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.981
But if you do it this way, it
just falls more naturally.

11:53.982 --> 11:55.024
Yeah, I feel like, uh,

11:55.025 --> 11:57.020
Jackson Pollock throwing paint at a canvas.

11:57.021 --> 11:59.860
Okay. Okay. Let's see what we've got.

11:59.861 --> 12:00.933
Yeah? Okay.

12:01.985 --> 12:04.465
Okay, drumroll, please.

12:04.552 --> 12:05.592
And...

12:05.816 --> 12:09.533
Okay, well, you know, it's
not Rockefeller center,

12:09.534 --> 12:11.877
but... but it is... it is charming.

12:11.878 --> 12:14.325
Yes. Yeah, you know,
it's... it's, um, it's minimal.

12:14.326 --> 12:16.489
Think... think... think
Hemingway, think Bauhaus.

12:16.490 --> 12:18.873
Actually, I was thinking Charlie brown.

12:20.102 --> 12:21.861
That's my favorite character in fiction.

12:22.589 --> 12:23.441
You're good.

12:23.442 --> 12:27.585
You know, you are very sweet.
Thank you for helping me.

12:28.081 --> 12:28.964
Mm.

12:28.965 --> 12:32.566
Mm. If that is somebody
named Kevin, ignore him.

12:34.358 --> 12:35.828
I'm coming. Hey!

12:36.057 --> 12:37.661
Hi! Hey. We're here.

12:37.662 --> 12:40.109
Yeah, hi, hi. Hello. Hey.

12:40.261 --> 12:41.461
All right. Okay.

12:41.656 --> 12:44.520
You guys are, uh, you're so early.

12:44.521 --> 12:47.333
Well, this is Seth. This is Evan, my son.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.788
Oh. Oh. You want to say hi?

12:48.952 --> 12:50.108
And, uh... hey, man.

12:50.109 --> 12:51.999
This is my... my brother Justin.
Seth... I'm Justin.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.559
Oh, hey, Justin. How are you?
Nice to meet you.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.847
Seth was helping me decorate the tree. Ah.

12:55.856 --> 12:58.174
Okay, let's... let's put
some tinsel on the tree.

12:58.175 --> 13:00.544
How was the, uh, Christmas fair?

13:00.545 --> 13:03.369
Uh, well, the fair was
kind of a bust, actually.

13:03.370 --> 13:05.881
The line to meet Santa was
over two blocks long.

13:05.882 --> 13:08.452
So we just waved and smiled at him.

13:08.453 --> 13:10.292
Aw. Oh, well, okay.

13:10.293 --> 13:13.920
You know what? I'm gonna take
you to see Santa another time.

13:13.921 --> 13:15.913
Actually, we got to write a letter instead.

13:15.914 --> 13:18.521
Macy's has this cool "believe" campaign.

13:18.602 --> 13:20.688
For every letter to Santa that
you bring in to the store,

13:20.689 --> 13:22.428
they'll donate $1 to the
make-a-wish foundation.

13:22.429 --> 13:25.139
So Evan wrote a letter, I wrote a letter,

13:25.140 --> 13:27.397
and I wrote a letter for you.
And what did I ask Santa for?

13:27.398 --> 13:29.524
A wireless DVD player to go along

13:29.525 --> 13:31.618
with the 52-inch flat
screen that I asked for.

13:31.619 --> 13:33.536
Wow. That's so generous of me.

13:33.537 --> 13:34.642
I mean, you're the best.

13:34.753 --> 13:36.576
Oh, um, I guess Evan wants to

13:36.577 --> 13:38.556
show me some dinosaurs.
Well, that's pretty much

13:38.557 --> 13:40.813
a requirement of everyone he meets.

13:40.814 --> 13:42.158
Oh. Okay.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.800
Kitty. What?

13:44.801 --> 13:45.777
Kitty. What?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.936
So this is the guy you're hiding from us?

13:47.937 --> 13:51.191
He's younger than I am.
I'm not hiding him. He...

13:51.192 --> 13:52.976
We-we're just... we're just having fun.

13:52.977 --> 13:55.799
Yeah, well, it seemed like I
was interrupting some fun

13:55.800 --> 13:57.156
when I knocked on the...
No, no, Justin,

13:57.157 --> 13:59.238
he was helping me with the Christmas tree.

13:59.316 --> 14:02.277
Which is very christmassy, isn't it?

14:03.849 --> 14:05.360
Uh, I-I guess, yeah.

14:05.361 --> 14:07.329
But you're... you're gonna do more, right?

14:07.705 --> 14:10.489
Well, what... what do you mean, "more"?

14:10.504 --> 14:13.466
Well, I... I mean, look at the fireplace.

14:13.467 --> 14:15.209
Look how lonely it looks
without stockings. Well...

14:15.210 --> 14:16.952
And where is the figgy pudding? Okay,

14:16.953 --> 14:18.809
you know what, Justin?
You have to stop pressuring me.

14:18.810 --> 14:19.785
It's not my fault

14:19.786 --> 14:22.124
that you invited some
Christmas-starved girl over here

14:22.125 --> 14:24.740
to gawk at us like we're
some holiday diorama.

14:24.741 --> 14:26.760
Kitty, I'm not asking for miracles here.

14:26.761 --> 14:28.676
Just spruce it up a little bit.

14:28.677 --> 14:30.072
Have you been over to Kevin's yet?

14:30.073 --> 14:34.086
No, but I hear he's really motivated.
Two Christmas trees.

14:34.087 --> 14:37.479
Exactly. It's confusing.
What is poor Santa to do?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.369
Which one is he gonna put
the presents under, Justin?

14:39.370 --> 14:42.472
All I'm saying is, this
place is a little bare.

14:42.473 --> 14:45.322
It's minimal. Yeah.

14:46.456 --> 14:47.197
You wanted to see me?

14:47.198 --> 14:48.736
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

14:48.737 --> 14:50.802
Listen, Frank, yesterday... eggnog?

14:52.241 --> 14:53.425
No, thanks, Frank.

14:53.567 --> 14:56.110
Yesterday I gave you a list of terminations

14:56.111 --> 14:57.124
that I needed made.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.856
I hear that there's a team of
radio hosts who haven't...

14:59.857 --> 15:01.904
Yeah, Sarah, I'm sorry,
but Abner and Louise

15:01.905 --> 15:05.239
have had a show on this
station for 35 years.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.042
They're an institution.
Could you please turn off your tie

15:08.094 --> 15:09.492
while I'm talking to you?

15:10.879 --> 15:12.193
The show is their life.

15:12.194 --> 15:14.233
You kick 'em out, they have no place to go.

15:14.234 --> 15:17.274
Yeah, well, it's Christmas.
There's no room at the inn.

15:19.569 --> 15:21.369
You want to fire Abner and Louise,

15:21.370 --> 15:23.038
you're gonna have to do it yourself.

15:23.193 --> 15:23.765
As a matter of fact,

15:23.766 --> 15:25.194
they're just finishing up their show now,

15:25.285 --> 15:27.076
so be my guest. Fine.

15:28.551 --> 15:31.305
Honestly, I'm a little surprised, Frank,

15:31.306 --> 15:34.424
that a manager as good as you
is not a little more proficient

15:34.425 --> 15:39.365
in the fine art of... letting people go.

15:39.366 --> 15:42.692
Tell the children what you're
getting for Christmas, Abner?

15:42.966 --> 15:45.734
A dummy on radio, Frank?

15:46.073 --> 15:48.918
They started out in vaudeville, together.

15:48.919 --> 15:50.275
Oh, Abner,

15:50.276 --> 15:53.331
do you think you could
manage a nice good night

15:53.332 --> 15:55.637
to all of our friends out there?

15:56.877 --> 15:58.188
Good night...

15:58.189 --> 16:01.581
You were saying, about the
fine art of letting people go?

16:07.935 --> 16:09.917
I'm Sarah, the station owner.

16:27.929 --> 16:29.130
What do you think?

16:29.154 --> 16:31.252
I mean, we're still waiting for
the Kris Kringle cocoa cups,

16:31.253 --> 16:32.981
but so far, pretty good, right?

16:34.009 --> 16:36.083
Um, yeah, well, you know,
to... to be honest,

16:36.084 --> 16:39.125
I think we could probably use
a little more sugar plum

16:39.126 --> 16:42.108
and a-a little less... fairy.

16:42.109 --> 16:44.560
What, I-is it the golden
girls tree toppers?

16:44.561 --> 16:46.105
No, Kevin, it's everything, all right?

16:46.106 --> 16:48.872
Where... where's... where's
the... the toy soldiers?

16:48.873 --> 16:51.487
Where's the... the nutcracker?
Where's the figgy pudding?

16:51.488 --> 16:54.519
What? I'm sorry, but I-I need
this Christmas to be like,

16:54.678 --> 16:56.420
you know, like the old Christmas movies

16:56.421 --> 16:59.096
with... with Jimmy Stewart, where
he's... where he's crying. Crying?

16:59.097 --> 17:02.248
Because he's happy.
You know, like hap-happy tears, Kevin.

17:02.797 --> 17:05.237
And little miss yule log cabin republican,

17:05.238 --> 17:07.159
how is it at her place? It's a little sad.

17:07.160 --> 17:07.933
I'm not gonna lie to you.

17:07.934 --> 17:10.007
Yeah. Look, Kevin, I really
like this girl, okay?

17:10.008 --> 17:13.385
And I promised her a Christmas like, uh...

17:14.009 --> 17:15.625
I don't know, like... like mom's.

17:19.101 --> 17:20.317
Wait. What?

17:20.454 --> 17:22.773
I know just what we need, without which

17:23.405 --> 17:25.679
no Walker Christmas is a Walker Christmas.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.294
Your hot nurse is gonna love this.

17:28.295 --> 17:29.413
Hold on to your sleigh bells, Bucko.

17:29.414 --> 17:31.670
I'm gonna be right back. Ho, ho, ho!

17:32.094 --> 17:33.262
Ho, ho, ho!

17:33.725 --> 17:34.877
Ho, ho, ho!

17:34.896 --> 17:35.829
Oh.

17:36.701 --> 17:39.997
I almost have the feeling back in my toes.

17:40.306 --> 17:41.803
It was warm in the cathedral.

17:41.804 --> 17:45.485
Thanks to the 20,000
tourists in there with us.

17:45.958 --> 17:49.105
One for every cutesy little
gift shop on the Plaza.

17:49.106 --> 17:51.281
They don't tell you about
that in the magazines.

17:51.634 --> 17:54.531
Oh, somehow I don't think this
turned out the way you wanted.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.840
Karl, no, it's... it's not Santa Fe.
Honestly.

17:57.841 --> 17:59.265
It's... it's... it's me.

18:00.233 --> 18:04.113
My children don't call me for
one day, and I'm a wreck.

18:04.114 --> 18:07.216
I told them to have their
own wonderful Christmas,

18:07.217 --> 18:10.308
and they... seem to be doing just that.

18:10.309 --> 18:11.487
And why is that a problem?

18:11.488 --> 18:13.811
Exactly. Exactly. Why is it a problem?

18:13.812 --> 18:16.164
It's not a problem.
It's just me. It's just me.

18:16.165 --> 18:18.650
Look at me. I'm like... I have the D.T.S.

18:18.651 --> 18:19.888
It's like I've... it's like

18:19.889 --> 18:22.200
I've gone cold turkey or something. Nora...

18:22.201 --> 18:24.037
No, no, it's true. I'm a junkie,

18:24.038 --> 18:26.799
and I'm jonesing for my children to call me

18:26.800 --> 18:28.401
and ask me something, anything.

18:28.554 --> 18:32.618
How many cups of sugar go into
a Hungarian nut foldover?

18:32.674 --> 18:36.277
I-I-I get high on them needing me.

18:36.278 --> 18:37.893
But it's not fair to them.

18:37.991 --> 18:42.010
God. I'm a vampire, sucking
the life out of my children.

18:42.011 --> 18:44.980
No, Nora. Addict, maybe.

18:44.981 --> 18:47.460
Vampire, no. Listen... oh.

18:47.461 --> 18:49.814
It is my professional opinion

18:49.993 --> 18:52.024
that you're just little bit
out of your head right now.

18:52.025 --> 18:53.648
Well, how do I get back into it?

18:53.649 --> 18:57.125
Well... I would prescribe
a good night's sleep.

18:57.126 --> 18:58.053
Oh.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.308
Now it just so happens
that I never leave home

19:00.309 --> 19:04.436
without my little stash of mild sedatives.

19:04.437 --> 19:07.936
Sleeping in strange hotels is not my forte.

19:07.937 --> 19:09.041
So...

19:12.285 --> 19:13.195
Well...

19:14.682 --> 19:16.314
If it's my only hope.

19:23.286 --> 19:24.131
Oh...

19:24.132 --> 19:28.647
How did I ever get to be
such a terrible mother?

19:29.121 --> 19:32.290
Oh, I should've run away years ago.

19:33.345 --> 19:36.385
They would've been a hell of
a lot better off without me.

19:37.652 --> 19:38.596
Oh.

19:38.597 --> 19:41.637
"Christmas tree topper, garland, lights."

19:41.638 --> 19:43.189
Where's the train? Where's the train?

19:43.190 --> 19:45.453
Oh, my God. There is so much stuff.

19:45.454 --> 19:47.185
"Decorations, gift wrapping,

19:47.186 --> 19:49.555
"Christmas lights. Bows."

19:50.317 --> 19:52.045
"Santa's village."

19:54.277 --> 19:56.309
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.280
Oh, my...

19:58.757 --> 20:01.625
Oh, my God, Kevin. Kevin, you scared me.

20:01.626 --> 20:02.592
What's going on, Kit?

20:02.593 --> 20:04.512
Nothing. I just popped by

20:04.513 --> 20:08.257
to... to get some tinsel. Tinsel?

20:08.258 --> 20:09.540
Tinsel. You know, for the tree.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.749
I know what tinsel's for.

20:10.750 --> 20:14.741
Good. So now I have my tinsel.
So I'm going to go.

20:14.905 --> 20:17.450
Why does it say "Santa's
village" on your box?

20:17.524 --> 20:19.108
It does? Mm-hmm.

20:19.158 --> 20:20.873
You think you're real crafty, don't you?

20:20.874 --> 20:22.090
Only you forgot one thing.

20:22.477 --> 20:24.640
Mom puts Santa's village in
the "Santa's village" box,

20:24.641 --> 20:28.930
but she puts his train...
in "candles and icicles."

20:30.993 --> 20:32.049
Whoops.

20:33.696 --> 20:35.521
Really, Kevin, is this what it's come to?

20:35.522 --> 20:37.092
Why don't you give me the village?

20:37.093 --> 20:39.861
Because we all know it doesn't
mean anything without the train.

20:39.862 --> 20:42.444
But the train doesn't mean
anything without the village,

20:42.445 --> 20:44.992
so... I set it up every year.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.897
I know where the general
store goes, the post office,

20:46.898 --> 20:48.743
the little town square gazebo.

20:48.744 --> 20:51.066
It would be useless in your hands.

20:51.264 --> 20:52.420
Just give me the village.

20:52.421 --> 20:54.500
This isn't about the village, is it, Kevin?

20:54.501 --> 20:57.628
You know, in fact, this is
about who's going to carry

20:57.629 --> 21:00.445
the Walker torch after
mom isn't here anymore.

21:00.762 --> 21:02.329
Your words, not mine.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.057
Always the lawyer, aren't you?

21:04.075 --> 21:06.425
It's so typical of a
politician to blame a lawyer.

21:06.426 --> 21:08.757
Right from the beginning, you
just assumed it was your right.

21:08.758 --> 21:10.688
So did you. No, I'm fighting for my right

21:10.689 --> 21:12.220
because I'm sick and tired
of everyone thinking

21:12.221 --> 21:13.677
- that Scotty and I aren't a real family.
- Oh, my God.

21:13.907 --> 21:16.660
Did you just play the gay card?

21:16.993 --> 21:20.680
Because you come from the
most loving, liberal family

21:20.681 --> 21:21.473
known to man.

21:21.474 --> 21:24.004
Mom couldn't be more gay
friendly if she twirled a Baton

21:24.005 --> 21:26.048
up Santa Monica boulevard
in a Cher costume.

21:26.049 --> 21:28.461
If you're so tolerant, let me do Christmas.

21:28.462 --> 21:30.544
Did it ever occur to you

21:30.545 --> 21:33.645
that I need to show my son
that we are still a family

21:33.646 --> 21:35.863
after everything that we've been through?

21:36.876 --> 21:38.560
I'm not allowed to use the gay card,

21:38.561 --> 21:40.347
but you're allowed to pull the widow card?

21:40.348 --> 21:42.289
I cannot believe that you just said that.

21:42.290 --> 21:43.727
I'm sorry you're being so intractable.

21:43.728 --> 21:45.124
I'm not the one foaming at the mouth

21:45.125 --> 21:46.739
like some Christmas crackhead.

21:46.740 --> 21:50.199
- Well, maybe we shouldn't do it
together this year. - Fine by me.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.382
Go ahead, Kevin. Go have your 2-tree'd,

21:52.383 --> 21:54.941
l.G.B.T.'D, politically correct,

21:54.942 --> 21:58.104
"don me now my gay apparel"
holiday extravaganza

21:58.105 --> 21:58.926
without me.

22:01.231 --> 22:02.812
Enjoy the train.

22:02.813 --> 22:03.630
Enjoy the village.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.471
They would've been

22:35.472 --> 22:37.257
a hell of a lot better off without me.

22:37.258 --> 22:38.806
Better off without me, without me,

22:38.807 --> 22:40.069
without me.

22:42.249 --> 22:43.770
I told you I would take care of it.

22:44.687 --> 22:46.738
Listen, I'll have the money
back in the bank account

22:46.739 --> 22:47.825
by the end of the month.

22:50.236 --> 22:51.538
I didn't think you would make it.

22:51.539 --> 22:53.330
Little meltdown on the domestic front,

22:53.331 --> 22:54.040
but I'm here.

22:57.502 --> 22:58.267
Kevin?

22:59.775 --> 23:02.310
- They can't hear you, Nora. - Nice vest.

23:02.311 --> 23:03.632
Mm. You're not here.

23:03.633 --> 23:06.190
Sorry we're late. The little angels

23:06.191 --> 23:08.205
decided their Christmas
dresses were too scratchy

23:08.579 --> 23:10.955
till their daddy told his
princesses how pretty they look.

23:10.956 --> 23:12.469
Kevin's married?

23:13.323 --> 23:14.077
To a woman?

23:14.385 --> 23:16.353
Merry Christmas, auntie Sarah.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.362
No sticky fingers. It's lacroix.

23:18.363 --> 23:20.649
With kids? He always did want children.

23:20.650 --> 23:23.402
- Let's go look at the presents.
- No peeking.

23:24.869 --> 23:26.556
- Are you ready for this? - No.

23:27.676 --> 23:29.642
But nothing a couple of
shots of bourbon won't fix.

23:31.265 --> 23:32.315
Karl, what's happening?

23:32.701 --> 23:34.491
You always thought your kids
would've been better off

23:34.492 --> 23:36.271
if you'd run away years ago.

23:36.272 --> 23:39.606
- Well, now you can see for yourself.
- Where did I run away to?

23:39.607 --> 23:41.076
A condo in Boca.

23:41.252 --> 23:44.039
Boca? That's impossible.
My mother lives there.

23:44.385 --> 23:46.289
Come. There's more to see.

23:54.707 --> 23:55.479
Oh, my God.

23:55.480 --> 23:58.496
Who decorated this place, the tooth fairy?

24:00.322 --> 24:02.757
Hey, Kev, Sarah, this is, uh, angel.

24:03.081 --> 24:05.195
Which is perfect for Christmas.

24:06.998 --> 24:08.613
Oh, my God. He's drunk.

24:08.905 --> 24:10.326
Yes, he's always drunk now.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.643
You see, there was no one
there to rally the troops

24:12.644 --> 24:15.090
- for his intervention.
- She's on the top of the tree.

24:15.091 --> 24:16.863
She flies 'cause she's got wings.

24:16.864 --> 24:20.560
Who's he gonna bring
over for Easter... Bunny?

24:21.261 --> 24:21.950
Kitty.

24:22.569 --> 24:24.844
Well, why is she mumbling like that?

24:25.176 --> 24:27.133
Without you there to rebel against,

24:27.134 --> 24:28.637
she never found her voice.

24:30.134 --> 24:31.342
Who's this one from, daddy?

24:31.343 --> 24:34.540
- Well, let's see, shall we?
- She's got wings.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.986
"With love, from grandma Nora." Wow.

24:36.987 --> 24:37.902
Who's grandma Nora?

24:44.172 --> 24:46.254
- "Who's grandma Nora?
" - Oh, you girls are too young to remember.

24:46.647 --> 24:48.306
But guess what. She'll be here tonight,

24:48.307 --> 24:50.943
- so you'll get to see her.
- Yeah, briefly.

24:51.444 --> 24:53.734
Hello, my darlings.

24:53.735 --> 24:55.047
Nana! Nana!

24:55.048 --> 24:56.811
"Nana. Nana."

24:56.812 --> 24:58.658
What is holly doing here?

24:59.313 --> 25:00.408
You didn't really expect William

25:00.409 --> 25:01.816
to remain alone, did you? Oh!

25:01.817 --> 25:04.412
William married holly? This is her house?

25:04.413 --> 25:06.578
Oh, God, Karl. I can't see anymore.

25:06.579 --> 25:08.151
Please take me back to Santa Fe.

25:08.152 --> 25:11.294
Oh, Nora, Nora, it's...
it's only just begun.

25:11.738 --> 25:15.000
It's so wonderful to see you all here.

25:15.001 --> 25:17.333
She said with a big fake smile on her face.

25:17.334 --> 25:18.397
Do you think you could try

25:18.398 --> 25:20.964
to make yourself presentable
for the occasion?

25:20.965 --> 25:22.977
Oh, yeah. The occasion.

25:22.978 --> 25:24.545
Christmas with Eva Braun.

25:24.866 --> 25:27.144
No one is forcing you to live here, Kitty.

25:27.145 --> 25:29.843
I'm your meal ticket, not your jailer.

25:30.152 --> 25:32.429
Hey, you two little angels,

25:32.430 --> 25:36.290
how would you like to watch
one of Nana's movies

25:36.291 --> 25:37.452
before dinner?

25:37.453 --> 25:38.390
Yeah!

25:38.661 --> 25:41.700
- How about the one with
the chimpanzee? - Yeah!

25:41.701 --> 25:42.796
Yes? Okay, let's go.

25:44.156 --> 25:44.977
Bye.

25:48.355 --> 25:50.678
Six months in the jungle with her?

25:50.679 --> 25:53.285
No wonder the monkey fired his agent.

25:53.286 --> 25:54.756
Stay cool, little sister.

25:54.757 --> 25:57.386
We stick to the plan, you'll
be free of her forever.

25:58.361 --> 26:00.317
Plan? What are they talking about?
What plan?

26:00.318 --> 26:03.846
- Excuse me, everybody. - Oh, Scotty!

26:04.259 --> 26:06.909
Oh, please tell me he's
not as bad as the rest.

26:06.910 --> 26:09.554
Uh, this is a cheese puff
filled with mango peach salsa

26:09.555 --> 26:11.568
to keep you busy, and
dinner is on its merry way.

26:11.569 --> 26:12.950
Thank you. Yeah, great.

26:13.349 --> 26:14.461
I'm just gonna run to the kitchen

26:14.462 --> 26:15.523
and grab some more ice.

26:15.524 --> 26:19.146
Oh, is that what they're
calling it nowadays... ice?

26:20.887 --> 26:22.428
Nora, this way.

26:25.015 --> 26:26.469
Oh, would you stop?

26:26.940 --> 26:28.607
Donner can't keep his hands off blitzen.

26:28.608 --> 26:31.482
Oh, Kevin. Your wife is in the other room.

26:31.483 --> 26:33.193
Well, then we could steal
away to my old bedroom.

26:33.194 --> 26:34.189
I kept all my old toys.

26:34.190 --> 26:36.484
You could pin your tail on my donkey.
Ee-aw.

26:37.303 --> 26:38.521
Yeah. Oh.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.631
Why is he still in the closet?

26:40.632 --> 26:41.662
You weren't there to tell him

26:41.663 --> 26:43.979
- it was okay to step out of it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:43.980 --> 26:46.545
This is wrong. We can't keep
doing this, Kevin. I... Shh.

26:47.013 --> 26:48.628
Isn't that better? Mm.

26:48.629 --> 26:49.680
Really, Kevin?

26:50.422 --> 26:52.039
Thank God I learned the heimlich
maneuver in the scouts.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.690
- Are you okay, young man? - I'm fine.

26:55.640 --> 26:59.754
- Good. - You're already being
blackmailed by one service provider.

26:59.755 --> 27:01.287
You trying to make it a matched set?

27:01.288 --> 27:02.432
Oh, you're one to talk.

27:02.433 --> 27:04.508
Philandry isn't nearly as expensive a hobby

27:04.509 --> 27:06.031
- as embezzlement. - Well,

27:06.032 --> 27:08.317
we're both about to solve
our problems, aren't we?

27:08.744 --> 27:11.605
How did my older sister
become so cold-hearted?

27:11.606 --> 27:14.613
It's just another termination
as far as I'm concerned.

27:14.891 --> 27:16.808
Termination? Who... who's she terminating?

27:16.809 --> 27:18.807
Oh, Karl, is something
terrible about to happen?

27:18.808 --> 27:20.102
Oh, beyond your imagining.

27:20.103 --> 27:23.752
Hey-o. Whoa. Hey, hey, this is...

27:24.604 --> 27:26.574
This is my type of Christmas, huh?

27:28.891 --> 27:31.940
Ay-yi-yi-yi. Ooh, that's sweet.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.850
I'm not surprised.
It's powdered sugar for the futzenfassen.

27:34.851 --> 27:36.338
- Pfeffernussen. - Shut up, Kevin.

27:36.339 --> 27:38.619
Justin, pull yourself together.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.787
You're pathetic. We've got a job to do.

27:41.249 --> 27:43.082
Look, Sarah, I don't think
this is a good idea.

27:43.083 --> 27:44.746
Think of it this way, little brother...

27:44.996 --> 27:48.878
One-fifth of the money dad
left her can be yours.

27:48.879 --> 27:51.534
A lifetime supply of
Peruvian pleasure powder.

27:55.798 --> 27:56.756
It's showtime.

27:56.757 --> 27:58.803
I didn't raise them to be like this.

27:59.082 --> 27:59.954
Exactly, Nora.

28:00.301 --> 28:01.523
You didn't raise them at all.

28:04.912 --> 28:05.904
Follow me.

28:07.787 --> 28:09.564
Holly, dinner's gonna be a little delayed.

28:09.565 --> 28:11.065
Could you go check on the kids,

28:11.077 --> 28:13.003
make sure they're snug as a bug upstairs?

28:13.004 --> 28:14.422
I would love to.

28:14.705 --> 28:19.011
- They're probably at the part
where the chimp proposes. - Yeah.

28:21.587 --> 28:23.908
Oh, my God. They're going
to kill holly, aren't they?

28:23.909 --> 28:27.415
Merry Christmas merry, merry,
merry, merry Christmas

28:27.416 --> 28:30.956
on they sing, on without
end their joyful tone

28:30.957 --> 28:32.560
there's no turning back now.

28:32.561 --> 28:36.199
Ding, ding, a-dong, this is their
song rings joyfully, all caroling

28:36.200 --> 28:40.902
this is for the warm and personal
checks you sent us every birthday.

28:40.903 --> 28:45.265
Raising the sound, o'er hill and Dale

28:45.266 --> 28:49.519
for all those postcards from exotic places.

28:51.618 --> 28:54.687
For the college trip that
you almost took us on.

28:57.021 --> 28:59.531
For being there when I
pitched my perfect game,

29:00.534 --> 29:02.124
in spirit, anyway.

29:04.847 --> 29:06.152
And one for Tommy.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.809
Oh. We all know how that worked out.

29:10.622 --> 29:11.639
What happened to Tommy?

29:11.640 --> 29:14.157
Believe me, Nora, you...
you don't want to know.

29:14.517 --> 29:17.992
Ah, the girls are all cozy in the den.

29:18.527 --> 29:20.448
You should see them.

29:20.855 --> 29:23.603
They're in stitches.

29:24.058 --> 29:26.712
Ding dongding, ding,
a-dong, ding, ding, a-dong

29:26.713 --> 29:28.235
ding dong ding, ding,
a-dong, ding, ding, a-dong

29:28.926 --> 29:29.679
holly...

29:29.680 --> 29:31.639
Don't drink the eggnog.
They're trying to kill you.

29:32.088 --> 29:34.989
Ding dong ding, ding,
a-dong, ding, ding, a-dong

29:34.990 --> 29:36.923
any final words, holly?

29:37.869 --> 29:39.735
Ding dong ding, ding,
a-dong, ding, ding, a-dong

29:39.736 --> 29:41.576
for you, Nora,

29:41.820 --> 29:47.084
for bringing us all together
as one big, happy family.

29:47.224 --> 29:49.503
Ding dong

30:00.357 --> 30:02.272
welcome home, mother.

30:04.849 --> 30:07.696
It's not holly they're going to kill.
It's me!

30:08.079 --> 30:09.559
No!

30:12.052 --> 30:13.545
No!

30:23.209 --> 30:25.166
Oh, God, Karl, it was... it was awful.

30:25.167 --> 30:27.911
I mean, my children were... were monsters.

30:27.912 --> 30:30.673
They were ruthless and... and conniving.

30:30.674 --> 30:32.863
This cold turkey is not working for me,

30:32.864 --> 30:34.787
not on... on Christmas.

30:34.788 --> 30:35.962
What was I thinking?

30:37.896 --> 30:38.939
I want to go home.

30:40.150 --> 30:40.974
Oh, Nora.

30:41.319 --> 30:43.001
No. No, no, no. I'm not gonna go home

30:43.002 --> 30:45.268
and then call them all and
drag them over to my house.

30:45.269 --> 30:47.405
I won't take over.
It won't be all about me.

30:47.601 --> 30:50.720
I'll just sit there quietly
and... and... and enjoy them.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.784
I mean, I-I have a right to enjoy them.

30:54.702 --> 30:57.788
They're extraordinary
people, and I love them.

30:59.048 --> 31:00.403
And that's a good thing.

31:00.819 --> 31:01.518
Yes.

31:02.466 --> 31:03.305
It's beautiful.

31:06.726 --> 31:07.471
Come in.

31:11.026 --> 31:12.072
Come in. Come in.

31:12.469 --> 31:15.659
I'm so glad you called. Uh, sit, please.

31:16.951 --> 31:18.490
God, it's been a long time.

31:18.996 --> 31:21.306
I guess I was still anchoring back then.

31:22.524 --> 31:23.658
Loaded half the time.

31:24.643 --> 31:25.765
Were you watching the night

31:25.766 --> 31:28.212
I confused Gorbachev with Baryshnikov?

31:28.213 --> 31:30.129
No, I-I don't think so. Yes.

31:30.530 --> 31:32.220
Listen, Jonathan, this is a little

31:32.221 --> 31:34.757
difficult for me... difficult?
What is it, Saul?

31:38.289 --> 31:40.752
Last year, I found out that I'm h.
I.V. Positive.

31:41.997 --> 31:42.730
Oh. I'm fine.

31:43.295 --> 31:46.584
I mean, I-I'm... I'm good.
My... my... my numbers are good.

31:46.585 --> 31:48.462
But you can imagine what
a shock it was for me.

31:48.463 --> 31:49.555
Well, actually, I can.

31:50.272 --> 31:52.301
When I found out I was, it was....

31:52.961 --> 31:54.328
Like the world stopped.

31:54.822 --> 31:56.228
But that was a long time ago.

31:56.699 --> 31:58.207
They know much more about it now.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.669
I was infected a long
time ago, too, Jonathan.

32:01.666 --> 32:03.637
And... you just found out?

32:03.638 --> 32:05.717
I didn't think there was
any reason to be tested.

32:10.392 --> 32:12.217
Why didn't you call me, Jonathan?

32:12.726 --> 32:13.365
Call you?

32:17.320 --> 32:19.309
You know, last year, I thought
that I'd get all modern

32:19.310 --> 32:21.449
and I put myself on Facebook,
and there you were,

32:21.980 --> 32:24.088
writing about your
experience with the disease

32:24.089 --> 32:25.270
on your homepage.

32:25.271 --> 32:27.202
Yeah, well, it's part of my job now.

32:27.203 --> 32:30.318
I use my own story as a way of educating.

32:30.695 --> 32:31.515
Do you?

32:34.056 --> 32:35.164
With all this education,

32:35.165 --> 32:37.582
how come you didn't see fit to let me know?

32:38.380 --> 32:40.542
Isn't that one of the basic
tenants of this organization,

32:40.543 --> 32:42.908
to... to... to inform your sexual partners?

32:43.185 --> 32:43.987
Isn't that it?

32:47.393 --> 32:49.080
Why... why didn't you call me?

32:49.757 --> 32:50.914
Oh, my God.

32:53.466 --> 32:54.304
Oh, Saul.

32:55.273 --> 32:56.710
You don't remember sleeping with me.

32:57.753 --> 32:58.368
No.

32:59.289 --> 33:01.535
I thought that I was
falling in love with you.

33:01.997 --> 33:03.733
Why didn't you say something?

33:03.734 --> 33:06.164
I did, the night we slept together.

33:06.691 --> 33:08.290
I remember exactly what I said.

33:12.287 --> 33:15.626
- I said, "I could fall in love with
someone like you." - Oh, my God.

33:16.835 --> 33:17.495
You...

33:18.816 --> 33:20.056
You really don't remember

33:20.057 --> 33:22.411
the bad Chinese food we ate that night?

33:22.670 --> 33:24.390
You don't remember watching Lena Horne

33:24.391 --> 33:27.034
fill her coupe de ville
at the gas station...

33:27.035 --> 33:28.292
On the corner of vine...

33:30.773 --> 33:31.717
You don't remember.

33:34.129 --> 33:35.506
Okay. I'll... I'll fill you in.

33:36.587 --> 33:37.725
We ended up in your bed.

33:39.704 --> 33:42.042
And obviously, it didn't
mean anything to you at all.

33:43.374 --> 33:45.401
Saul, if I gave this to you...

33:49.256 --> 33:50.908
Well, there's nothing I can say.

34:26.128 --> 34:28.935
Oh. I'm sorry.

34:29.752 --> 34:30.702
We'll try and keep it down.

35:05.876 --> 35:08.671
Okay. Somebody has to
be the first to blink.

35:08.672 --> 35:11.371
Will you call her? Please.

35:15.834 --> 35:17.375
Kitty? What are you doing?

35:18.343 --> 35:20.686
Just watching this stupid
train go round and round

35:20.687 --> 35:22.379
like a dog trying to bite off its own tail.

35:22.380 --> 35:23.153
How about you?

35:23.154 --> 35:26.510
Oh, I'm just sitting here
staring at this dumb village.

35:26.511 --> 35:28.377
It's like there was a chemical disaster

35:28.378 --> 35:30.301
and all the little people had to move away.

35:31.327 --> 35:32.378
So what are we gonna do?

35:32.867 --> 35:34.652
Ugh. I don't know. I don't know.

35:34.653 --> 35:36.828
Should we call mom? No, let's not do that.

35:36.829 --> 35:38.293
She wants to be alone with Karl.

35:38.294 --> 35:40.665
And we have to figure out how
we can do this on our own.

35:40.890 --> 35:43.730
Oh, hang on. Oh, it's Sarah.

35:43.731 --> 35:45.561
You know she's always been
the tiebreaker. Hang on.

35:46.077 --> 35:47.103
Hi, Sarah. Hey.

35:47.104 --> 35:49.086
I'm on with Kevin.
I'm gonna put you on conference.

35:49.865 --> 35:52.357
Listen, whoever's having
Christmas, just count me out.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.566
Why? I fired an old lady

35:54.567 --> 35:56.205
and her wooden dummy yesterday.

35:56.206 --> 35:57.829
You fired a wooden dummy?

35:58.072 --> 35:59.733
Yes. I'm evil.

35:59.734 --> 36:02.045
No, Sarah. You're not evil.

36:02.046 --> 36:03.721
She did fire a wooden dummy, Kitty.

36:03.970 --> 36:05.628
Well, that doesn't make her evil, Kevin.

36:05.629 --> 36:08.106
I mean, don't you remember
what mom always used to say?

36:08.107 --> 36:10.252
That bad people are not really bad,

36:10.253 --> 36:12.905
they're... they're just afraid.
She also said

36:12.906 --> 36:15.438
that the shark in "jaws" only killed people

36:15.439 --> 36:18.310
because it was afraid that a
boat might run over its young.

36:18.658 --> 36:19.893
Well, maybe she's right.

36:19.894 --> 36:22.187
You know, that's why I bit
your head off last night, Kit,

36:22.663 --> 36:24.210
because I was afraid.

36:24.721 --> 36:27.319
You know, laugh all you want,
but growing up in this family,

36:27.320 --> 36:29.409
where it's all about family...

36:30.196 --> 36:31.861
I was always scared that I
was gonna be the only one

36:31.862 --> 36:33.125
never to have that.

36:33.126 --> 36:36.395
Yeah, well, you're not the
only one who's scared.

36:37.149 --> 36:38.990
I've been so concerned with

36:38.991 --> 36:40.157
making it on my own

36:40.460 --> 36:42.513
and proving to myself
that I don't need anybody

36:42.514 --> 36:44.496
that I forgot that I'm not on my own,

36:44.497 --> 36:46.061
and to make it even worse,

36:46.062 --> 36:49.152
I actually like the guy that
I'm not on my own with.

36:49.697 --> 36:51.350
So what about you, Sarah? Come on.

36:51.691 --> 36:53.883
We're all baring our souls here.
What are you scared of?

36:55.285 --> 36:57.628
Maybe I am scared

36:57.629 --> 37:01.007
that... I'm gonna shipwreck the company.

37:01.008 --> 37:02.012
Yeah, maybe.

37:02.290 --> 37:04.842
Maybe all our fears can come true. So what?

37:05.237 --> 37:07.073
Walkers aren't grinches. They're Whos.

37:07.074 --> 37:08.621
And when the Grinch did steal Christmas,

37:08.622 --> 37:11.404
and all the trees and presents
and decorations were gone,

37:11.405 --> 37:12.874
what did the Whos do?

37:23.677 --> 37:27.193
You went boogie boarding on Christmas Eve?

37:27.194 --> 37:30.162
Oh, and Santa speaks Spanish. Wow.

37:30.486 --> 37:31.152
Well, honey,

37:31.153 --> 37:32.915
you call me first thing
when you wake up, okay?

37:33.599 --> 37:34.898
Okay, baby. Bye.

37:37.119 --> 37:38.851
Mom, you're back.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.156
Yeah.

37:40.157 --> 37:42.261
Oh, my...
Hey, everyone, guess what.

37:42.700 --> 37:45.661
Mom's back. I'm not kidding. She's back.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.596
Mom. Hi.

37:47.913 --> 37:51.028
You're the last person
we were expecting. Mom!

37:51.995 --> 37:53.767
Oh, my God! Merry Christmas. What happened?

37:53.768 --> 37:54.786
What happened? What are you doing?

37:55.758 --> 37:57.368
What happened? Well, it's a long story.

37:57.369 --> 38:00.141
Whatever the story is, please,
please don't ever do that again.

38:00.142 --> 38:01.563
Yeah. That's not okay. Come here, mom.
Oh, thank God you're home.

38:01.564 --> 38:03.521
Let's drink.

38:04.226 --> 38:06.034
Mom, eggnog?

38:08.940 --> 38:11.145
Yes, I'd... I'd love some eggnog.

38:11.912 --> 38:13.508
I would love some eggnog. Yeah.

38:14.315 --> 38:15.636
Coming up. I think we all need some eggnog.

38:21.872 --> 38:22.755
Oh, my gosh. Hi. Hi.

38:24.518 --> 38:26.176
Seth. The grad student.

38:26.231 --> 38:27.784
Oh. Hey, okay, everyone.

38:28.362 --> 38:31.090
This is Seth. Hi, Seth.

38:31.091 --> 38:32.146
Hi, Seth. Hi, Seth.

38:32.846 --> 38:34.397
Wow. Uh, there are...

38:34.398 --> 38:36.153
There's so many of you, and so few of me.

38:36.468 --> 38:38.906
Welcome to Walker-ville. Have some eggnog.

38:38.907 --> 38:40.927
Yeah, have some eggnog. Merry Christmas!

38:40.928 --> 38:44.375
"And scrooge was better than his word.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.562
"And to tiny Tim,

38:47.129 --> 38:49.028
he was a second father."

38:49.608 --> 38:50.736
That's the least he could do.

38:51.678 --> 38:54.862
"And so tiny Tim observed,

38:55.400 --> 38:58.211
'God bless us, everyone.'"

39:08.204 --> 39:10.227
what's going on with you?
You've been so quiet all night.

39:10.228 --> 39:11.899
I just didn't feel like talking to anyone.

39:11.916 --> 39:15.399
I called that guy I met at
the restaurant. Oh, and?

39:16.472 --> 39:19.753
And, uh, I'll... I'll talk
about it some other time.

39:20.396 --> 39:22.488
Right now I just need a hug from my nephew.

39:22.489 --> 39:23.287
Oh. Come on.

39:24.777 --> 39:26.956
Uh-oh. Look out. Watch your backs.

39:26.957 --> 39:28.098
Coming through.

39:29.871 --> 39:30.499
What is that?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.008
Figgy pudding. It's on fire.

39:32.009 --> 39:33.557
Oh, that's figgy pudding? That's the point.

39:33.558 --> 39:34.845
It's... it's a traditional
Victorian recipe,

39:34.846 --> 39:35.785
although, I did throw in

39:35.786 --> 39:38.570
a little saffron and candied ginger.
Of course you did.

39:44.549 --> 39:45.315
Wow. Here you go. For you.

39:45.689 --> 39:48.924
Don't mind the mess. Okay. That's...
Whoa. It's just right.

39:48.925 --> 39:50.390
Thanks, mom.

39:53.524 --> 39:55.882
It's such a treat, having
you with us tonight.

39:55.883 --> 39:57.403
I wanted to thank you for coming.

39:57.793 --> 40:00.487
Well, thank you for taking
the ax out of my neck.

40:00.488 --> 40:03.432
It was easy once I realized
that the world will still turn

40:03.433 --> 40:05.695
with an hour less news on a Sunday morning.

40:05.958 --> 40:07.407
Well, then you've learned a lot.

40:09.794 --> 40:12.285
Well, this makes going
home for the holidays

40:12.286 --> 40:13.484
not seem all that bad.

40:13.485 --> 40:14.930
Oh, yeah. Home.

40:16.230 --> 40:19.475
You know, I shut you up the other day.

40:19.476 --> 40:21.536
You were about to say something about home.

40:21.537 --> 40:23.306
What... what is it that
you wanted to tell me?

40:23.447 --> 40:25.118
I don't think you want to hear that now.

40:25.119 --> 40:27.156
No, I do. I do. I really do.

40:27.157 --> 40:30.398
I am finished with mystery
and I want full disclosure.

40:34.845 --> 40:35.706
Well, uh...

40:35.707 --> 40:37.584
Oh, my God. Do you have a girlfriend?

40:37.585 --> 40:38.890
Are you dating somebody else?

40:40.094 --> 40:41.124
You know Dean Whitley?

40:41.125 --> 40:42.897
You're dating Dean Whitley?

40:43.051 --> 40:43.562
No.

40:44.043 --> 40:46.082
Uh, no, no.

40:48.490 --> 40:49.617
She... she's my mom.

40:50.095 --> 40:52.184
Sh-sh-she's my boss.

40:52.582 --> 40:53.937
She's your mother? Oh, my God.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.639
Oh, my God. Seth, why didn't
you tell me this before?

40:56.640 --> 40:58.245
I tried. Why didn't you try harder?

40:59.889 --> 41:00.895
Oh, my God.

41:00.896 --> 41:02.039
Because I was afraid.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.789
I-I was afraid that I was gonna lose you.

41:05.010 --> 41:06.401
Have I lost you?

41:11.035 --> 41:14.160
So amidst all this abundance
of holly and Ivy,

41:14.161 --> 41:17.378
I-I just wanted to remind my beloved family

41:17.379 --> 41:20.278
of our Jewish blood that flows
through all of our veins.

41:20.820 --> 41:23.285
And I know Hanukkah has passed,
and we've lit all the candles,

41:23.286 --> 41:26.571
and, uh, I just wanted to share a
little blessing that's offered

41:26.572 --> 41:29.193
in celebration of new beginnings.

41:50.218 --> 41:53.083
Which is to say, "blessed art
thou, king of the universe,

41:53.084 --> 41:54.554
"who has given us life,

41:54.926 --> 41:56.202
"who has sustained us,

41:57.395 --> 41:59.478
who has enabled us to reach this day."

42:00.381 --> 42:01.484
Amen. Amen.

42:02.714 --> 42:03.119
Amen.
