Like pillows?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.568
Exactly.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.504
It could come from pillow trees.

Perfect.

You know all about trees, Mom.

I like a fight.

You don't have to do this.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.781

08:30.010 --> 08:31.655
Oh, come here. Come here.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.906
Burglars usually avoid
breaking into houses

08:49.930 --> 08:51.775
where the owners are still home,

08:51.799 --> 08:54.978
but this individual seems
to be making a habit of it.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.482
He's hit about half a dozen
other houses in the area.

08:58.506 --> 09:00.717
Why? Why... why does he
want to do it like that?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.752
I think he's getting
a kick out of it.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.088
It's a control, power trip.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.957
He definitely... he
definitely liked the...

09:07.981 --> 09:10.083
he liked the control, I think.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.197
It was awful.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.133
It was awf... did you... did
anyone speak to my sister?

No.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.970
How are you doing?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.672
I just need to ask you a couple
of questions about last night.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.456
I haven't even offered
you anything to drink.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.092
I'm so sorry. Do you
want some coffee?

09:26.116 --> 09:27.076
No, no, thanks.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.580

09:28.604 --> 09:30.079
Your sister'll be here soon,

09:30.103 --> 09:33.016
and, um, look, you
should just relax.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.618
No, if... if I relax,

09:34.642 --> 09:36.553
if I slow down, I'm
gonna go crazy.

09:36.577 --> 09:37.821
I'm gonna lose my mind.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.949
Yeah, maybe tea.

09:43.551 --> 09:45.061
I'm sorry.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.831
I just imagined that cops
like dark, cheap coffee.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.266
Maybe it's some
sort of stereotype,

09:50.290 --> 09:53.069
or maybe it's...

09:53.093 --> 09:54.494
I like tea.

10:04.204 --> 10:08.317
When we really love someone,

10:08.341 --> 10:11.555
we learn how to fight.

10:11.579 --> 10:14.223
What do you mean?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.259

10:16.283 --> 10:17.994
when I was about
eight years old.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.229
He was a mean drunk. He
started beating up my mother.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.065
I felt helpless.
What could I do?

10:22.089 --> 10:25.969
I was eight years old, but
I started telling myself,

10:25.993 --> 10:27.837
"Soon as I get big enough,

10:27.861 --> 10:29.939
I will make sure that
he stops doing that."

10:29.963 --> 10:31.908
So every year got worse.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.743
I wondered if I would
ever get big enough

10:33.767 --> 10:35.344
or if we were even
gonna survive,

10:35.368 --> 10:39.015
but eventually I got big enough,

10:39.039 --> 10:42.819
and I made sure that
he never did it again.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.702
Did you know that hot tea

10:58.726 --> 11:01.128
can reach over 200 degrees?

I mean, I keep reliving
it over and over again.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.291
It's natural.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.095
Gwen, I was so helpless.

weak, the weak one.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.923
Okay, but you can learn
how to defend yourself.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.492
You have it in you.
I know you do.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.186

14:13.286 --> 14:16.365
No, no, this is
tournaments and belts.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.149
You just need somebody
that's gonna teach you

14:18.173 --> 14:19.435
how to fight dirty

14:19.459 --> 14:21.379
and mess somebody up if
they're coming after you.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.873
- Me fight dirty, really?

- Let me see.

I mean, what's wrong

14:36.543 --> 14:38.245

14:41.248 --> 14:43.448
No, actually, and look, see,
this is one of these, like,

14:43.472 --> 14:46.295
take-no-prisoner, get-it-done
self-defense kind of guys.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.321

what you need.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.491
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.433
Okay, guys,

15:24.457 --> 15:26.602
so your attacker has you
by the arms like this.

15:26.626 --> 15:29.038
The way you're gonna get out is,

15:29.062 --> 15:32.375
you're gonna roll out towards
the thumb with your forearm.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.178
That's your weak link, right?

15:35.202 --> 15:36.980
Let's show them, Rory.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.948
Come on. Come on,
make it tighter.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.183
Squeeze it. Squeeze it, Rory.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.485
Come on.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.320
Show them how you're
gonna stop me, squeeze.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.122
Is that the best you've got?
Come on, Marine!

15:46.146 --> 15:47.556
Come on! Get it!

15:47.580 --> 15:48.591
Get it!

15:50.317 --> 15:51.317
Nothing.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.086
That was sad.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.189
Drop and give me 50.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.406
All right, guys,
now, you remember,

16:03.430 --> 16:06.609
your attacker's not gonna be
a pushover like Rory here,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.544
but I promise you if you
drill the technique,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.014
I don't care how big, I don't
care how strong they are,

16:11.038 --> 16:13.149
it will work, all right?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.450
Look, let me show you.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.219
What you need to do,

16:16.243 --> 16:18.387
you need to rotate this
real hard towards that

16:18.411 --> 16:21.590
because the move
here is breaking...

16:21.614 --> 16:24.193
- I think you take out the...
- He isn't so big, right?

16:24.217 --> 16:26.457
When he grabs down on you like
that, his itty-bitty thumb

16:26.481 --> 16:28.481
can't hold back the power
of your whole arm, right?

16:28.505 --> 16:29.565
Let's see it.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.534
There you go.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.202
All right?

16:33.226 --> 16:34.327
Work it, guys. Work it.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.408
Hi.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.900
I'm Logan.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.604
Um, I'm Arden. Hi.

16:48.419 --> 16:50.019
I... I haven't signed
up yet or anything.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.144
Oh, that's okay.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.526
I... I'd like to just
put my purse down.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.328
- You feel threatened?
- Yes.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.464
- You feel scared?
- Just please let me go, okay?

17:01.488 --> 17:03.728
Come on. You're gonna have to
try a lot harder than that.

17:03.752 --> 17:05.634
- No, I...
- Arden, get out of this.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.303
What's the matter with you?

17:07.327 --> 17:09.172
- Let me go.
- Can't you get away?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.540
What's the matter with you?
Are you panicking? Huh?

17:11.564 --> 17:12.884
- Please just let go of me.
- Huh?

17:12.907 --> 17:15.278
Stop!

17:15.301 --> 17:16.742
See, that's what
he's gonna tell you.

17:16.766 --> 17:18.114
He's gonna tell you to stop.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.647
He's gonna tell
you to calm down.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.984
That's okay. Calm down,
'cause while he thinks

17:22.009 --> 17:23.286
he has you where he wants you,

17:23.310 --> 17:25.154
you can be collecting
your thoughts.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.323
You get calm. You
start thinking.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.258
You start remembering
your training.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.493
Breathe. Breathe.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.428
- I... but I...
- Breathe.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.596
- I don't have any training.
- What's your training?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.298
- Please.
- What's your training?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.100
- I don't have any training.
- Just do it.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.125
Go.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.669
Go!

17:40.693 --> 17:42.238
Go!

17:42.262 --> 17:44.773
There you go. There.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.710
That's perfect.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.712
That was really great.
That was really great.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.315
You did great. Guys,
you see that?

17:52.339 --> 17:54.483
Come on, let me see.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.185
See these marks on her wrists?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.487
I didn't go soft on her.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.323
I went full force.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.591
Still able to hold me off.
That was good.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.135
Everybody give her a
round of applause.

18:04.159 --> 18:06.162
Come on.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.597
All right, all right,
not too much, right?

18:08.621 --> 18:11.300
It's her first day.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.103
But she did good.

18:14.127 --> 18:16.139
But this isn't a circus.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.208
Right?

18:19.232 --> 18:21.610
What you learn in here

18:21.634 --> 18:23.479
is the difference
between life and death.

18:23.503 --> 18:27.650
It is the difference
between you being a victim

18:27.674 --> 18:30.386
or you sending your
attacker to the hospital.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.787
Why don't we bow in here?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.389
We don't bow in here
because we do not

18:33.413 --> 18:36.425
show respect to our
opponents out there.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.228
They are a predator.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.663
It is your job to
show them that,

18:40.687 --> 18:43.432
without a shadow of a
doubt, you aren't prey.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.457
Get going.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.585
So how'd it go?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.287
It was good, I guess.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.822
I mean, Logan seems to
know what he's doing.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.757
Logan, huh?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.726
Logan, he asked us
to call him Logan.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.795
No, I'm... I'm not
giving you a hard time.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.865
I mean, he's definitely good.
He's just very, very intense.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.368
Intense? Like, what
do you mean, intense?

19:19.392 --> 19:23.306
He... he sort of yells at
you, and all the fighting,

19:23.330 --> 19:26.309
it's just a little bit too
much combat for me right now.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.645
I just feel... I felt
a little overwhelmed.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.803
I don't know if I'm ready.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.695
Mommy!

19:46.719 --> 19:48.121
Mommy!

19:50.390 --> 19:51.624
Mommy!

19:56.296 --> 19:58.674
I had a nightmare.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.609
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.745
I was at home by myself,

20:02.769 --> 20:05.714
and there was this
wolf chasing me,

20:05.738 --> 20:07.550
and I kept calling your name,

20:07.574 --> 20:09.685
but you wouldn't come,

20:09.709 --> 20:11.587
so I ran in the living room,

20:11.611 --> 20:17.293
and I saw you tied
up like before.

20:17.317 --> 20:22.231
You couldn't help me, so I hid,
and I could hear the wolf.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.500
Sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.435
It was just a bad
dream, though, okay?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.405
I'm safe. You're safe.
You're okay.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.508
Is the bad man gonna
come back, Mommy?

20:32.532 --> 20:34.343
No.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.945
No, he's not, I
promise you, okay?

20:36.969 --> 20:40.416
How do you know?

20:40.440 --> 20:41.760
Well, 'cause it
would be dangerous

20:41.784 --> 20:43.286
for him if he came back.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.554
I mean, the police
would catch him.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.614
What if the police aren't here?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.421
I wish Daddy came back.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.835
I know you do. I know.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.694
Will he ever come back?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.200
I don't think so, baby.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.447
Why not?

21:11.471 --> 21:12.948
Did I do something?

21:12.972 --> 21:15.651
No, no, no, no, no.

21:15.675 --> 21:19.355
You never did anything wrong.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.458
Look, Daddy and I just
love differently.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.861
I mean, he thought love
was arguing and fighting,

21:25.885 --> 21:29.898
and I think love should be
more harmonious, you know?

21:29.922 --> 21:31.867
Like what we have.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.936
Do you understand?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.004
Sort of.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.706
I guess what I'm trying to say

21:37.730 --> 21:40.243
is that...

21:40.267 --> 21:42.711
Daddy and I were the problem.

21:42.735 --> 21:46.439
You have never, ever
been the problem.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.609
Okay?

21:50.943 --> 21:53.356
So if Daddy's not coming back,

21:53.380 --> 21:56.783
who's gonna protect us then?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.287
We can protect ourselves.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.669
Get out of that bed. Let
me show you something.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.437

22:11.331 --> 22:14.042
See? I have control,
so pull your hand.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.345
Yes.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.937
Oh, I do. Isn't it beautiful?

29:21.961 --> 29:23.095
I mean, this is my office.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.309
How'd you get into this?

29:27.333 --> 29:31.914
Well, I grew up in New York City

29:31.938 --> 29:33.949
- on the Lower East Side.
- Mm.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.918
There's not a lot
of nature there,

29:35.942 --> 29:38.721
so I'd go up to Central
Park every chance I had.

29:38.745 --> 29:41.223
There's this, like, series of
trails there called the Ramble.

29:41.247 --> 29:44.359
I'd spend hours and hours there.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.894
I guess it just helped me forget

29:45.918 --> 29:47.863
that I lived in the
city, you know?

29:47.887 --> 29:50.498
It helped me forget
all my problems.

29:50.522 --> 29:51.734
That sounds great.

29:51.758 --> 29:54.302
Yeah, it was awesome.

29:54.326 --> 29:57.305
It still astounds me
that a park like that

29:57.329 --> 30:01.910
can exist in a city like
New York City, you know?

30:01.934 --> 30:04.412
I don't know; I used
to go there so much,

30:04.436 --> 30:05.948
I got to know the head arborist,

30:05.972 --> 30:08.083
and he showed me
everything he knew.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.067
I mean, he taught me all
about the different birds

30:10.091 --> 30:14.022
and the different trees
that live there.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.424
My father had just passed away,

30:16.448 --> 30:20.829
so Mr. Crohn was like a
second father to me.

30:20.853 --> 30:23.365
Well, I... I totally
understand that, you know?

30:23.389 --> 30:24.933
I mean, I grew up in
the foster system,

30:24.957 --> 30:26.926
so I spent my whole life
looking for a family.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.728
Yeah.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.411
Come in.

30:47.814 --> 30:49.181
Oh.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.429
How'd he get past
your security system?

30:54.453 --> 30:58.033
Oh, it's new, you know?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.737
I know, nothing like
shutting the barn door

30:59.761 --> 31:01.904
after the horse got out, right?

31:01.928 --> 31:03.939
As long as it makes
you feel safe.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.340
I actually thought

31:05.364 --> 31:06.964
I saw somebody out
there the other night.

31:06.988 --> 31:09.477
It just pushed me to
get it installed.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.546
Out there?

31:11.570 --> 31:13.315
Yeah.

31:13.339 --> 31:17.285
I'm sure it was just, you know.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.829
It's not like the
thief would come back

31:18.853 --> 31:22.090
to the scene of
the crime, right?

31:22.114 --> 31:23.794
Well, you never know
what they're thinking,

31:23.818 --> 31:25.861
but you have good
instincts, Arden.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.062
I trust them.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.787
Thanks.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.937
Do you want some wine or...

31:34.961 --> 31:37.229
Yeah, yeah, wine is good.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.281
This your daughter?

31:46.305 --> 31:49.217
It is.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.019
Emma. Oh, I wish you
could meet her.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.921
She's having a play
date with a girlfriend.

31:52.945 --> 31:55.147
- She's adorable.
- She is.

31:56.382 --> 31:57.449
So where's Dad?

32:00.552 --> 32:02.064
He sort of, um,

32:02.088 --> 32:04.466
disappeared out of our lives.

32:04.490 --> 32:08.336
We haven't seen him in
about a year and a half.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.338
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.040
He got remarried to a lawyer,

32:12.064 --> 32:14.509
so I'm sure they get to
argue a lot together.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.979
She got pregnant really fast,
and they started a new family.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.982
It was almost like he
just wanted to forget

32:20.006 --> 32:22.408
that we ever existed.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.555
Yeah, see, I don't get that.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.819
I don't know how you could
just forget about your family.

32:36.222 --> 32:39.291
Must be really hard trying
to live without her.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.032
That's where the
bullet left my body.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.512
What bullet?

32:52.939 --> 32:55.050
Well, the truth is,

32:55.074 --> 32:58.520
my wife didn't just die, Arden.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.279
She was murdered.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.326
I'm... Logan, I'm sorry.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.627
- I didn't know.
- No.

33:05.651 --> 33:06.962
We don't have to talk about it.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.030
Arden, it's okay.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.132
I can talk about it...

33:10.156 --> 33:11.223
with you.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.094
Okay.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.233
We used to go camping
in the mountains a lot.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.314
Every weekend was
like an anniversary.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.651
There was no TV, no
phones, no Internet.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.210
We were very happy.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.839
Then one weekend there was this
car on the side of the road.

33:35.863 --> 33:39.161
So I slowed down to see
if he needed anything,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.353
had some engine
trouble, needed help.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.535
But he didn't.

33:47.559 --> 33:48.919
- I'm gonna check this out.
- Okay.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.278
Hi.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.137
You need some help?

33:59.505 --> 34:01.683
Yes, I do.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.975
Start walking down the hill.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.122
You don't have to do this.

34:07.146 --> 34:10.391
- Down the hill.
- Come on.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.551
I'm gonna be taking your car...

34:15.487 --> 34:17.223
And what's in it.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.101
No. No, Logan.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.235
Logan, no.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.770
Run, get out! [gunsh

34:22.793 --> 34:24.096
No, Logan!

34:25.697 --> 34:26.697
No!

34:27.799 --> 34:29.744
Run!

34:29.768 --> 34:31.536
Marie!

34:42.781 --> 34:44.449
I was lucky.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.824
There was campers that
heard the gunshots,

34:47.849 --> 34:49.531
so the paramedics came,

34:49.554 --> 34:51.690
and they got to me
before I bled out.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.302
They found Marie
facedown in the dirt.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.749
Logan, that's, um...

35:07.773 --> 35:09.384
That's awful.

35:09.408 --> 35:12.287
I'm so sorry.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.046
They caught the guy.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.126
After that, I swore to myself

35:18.150 --> 35:21.320
that I would never be
a victim ever again.

35:23.255 --> 35:26.834
And as I've gotten
better at what I do,

35:26.858 --> 35:30.538
it's become my mission

35:30.562 --> 35:32.482
to make sure that nobody
else is ever one either.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.435
You look fantastic.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.527
Thank you.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.631
You really are special, Arden.

can do, is beg?

36:46.638 --> 36:48.350
You beg, Arden?

36:48.374 --> 36:50.352
They could kill you
at any minute, Arden!

36:50.376 --> 36:51.686

American traveling abroad

36:59.785 --> 37:03.198
is more likely to be kidnapped
than a soldier in a combat zone?

37:03.222 --> 37:04.732
What are you gonna do, Arden?

37:04.756 --> 37:06.868
I'm not a soldier in a

would let you go

somebody on the
road will see you.

your chances get smaller.

Oh, no, no, this is a
huge misunderstanding.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.515
Actually, I have
documentation right here.

40:20.452 --> 40:22.654
Yeah. Yeah, she signed this.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.634

I have all my students who
work with me sign it.

Um, it says that I
have extreme methods,

40:30.829 --> 40:33.375
and that might include
mock kidnapping.

40:33.399 --> 40:35.009
Well, just because
you have it written

40:35.033 --> 40:37.479
in the small print
doesn't make it okay

40:37.503 --> 40:40.582
for you to lock
people in your trunk.

45:25.891 --> 45:28.803
No, not really.

45:28.827 --> 45:30.137
It's... it's just, um...

45:30.161 --> 45:32.139
What?

45:33.331 --> 45:36.234
Mommy's been having nightmares.

45:37.969 --> 45:40.371
She's, like, crying
in her sleep.

45:43.742 --> 45:45.920
Oh, sweetheart.

45:45.944 --> 45:46.988
Are you okay?

45:47.012 --> 45:50.191
I guess.

45:50.215 --> 45:52.459
It's got to be
really scary, huh?

45:52.483 --> 45:53.985
Yeah.

45:56.054 --> 45:57.355
Do you want me to come over?

46:00.759 --> 46:04.405
No, I... I don't want Mommy
to know I'm worried because

46:04.429 --> 46:06.173
then she'll be worried

46:06.197 --> 46:07.797
that she's making me
worried, and then...

46:07.821 --> 46:09.777
Right, I understand.

46:09.801 --> 46:11.245
How about this?

46:11.269 --> 46:12.709
I'll come over
tomorrow after school,

46:12.733 --> 46:14.481
and we'll talk about it, okay?

46:14.505 --> 46:15.505
Uh-huh.

46:17.475 --> 46:20.287
Okay.

46:20.311 --> 46:22.456
You're a brave girl, Emma.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.325
It's gonna be okay,
okay, sweetheart?

46:24.349 --> 46:26.728
Go back to sleep.

46:26.752 --> 46:28.362
Okay.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.364
I love you.

46:30.388 --> 46:31.990
Love you too.

47:13.999 --> 47:15.009
No, no, no.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.778
No, Logan, please don't!

47:16.802 --> 47:18.079
Logan, no! Let me out!

47:18.103 --> 47:26.103
No! No! Log... help!

47:27.178 --> 47:29.047
Oh, my God.

47:30.849 --> 47:33.227
Oh, no, I need to make more.

47:33.251 --> 47:34.285
Pause it.

47:39.190 --> 47:43.037
Um, any word from
Detective Banks?

47:44.462 --> 47:48.275
Um, yeah, we got the
restraining order,

47:48.299 --> 47:49.844
but the DA says it's
gonna be tricky

47:49.868 --> 47:51.545
because I signed
that release form,

47:51.569 --> 47:54.048
and there's all this fine print.

50:58.789 --> 51:01.568
You picked the wrong house
to break into, buddy.

51:01.592 --> 51:03.128
Why do you watch them?

51:05.063 --> 51:06.340
You take photos?

51:06.364 --> 51:07.365
Are you a cop?

51:09.600 --> 51:11.045
No, I'm not a cop,

51:11.069 --> 51:12.779
just an interested party.

51:12.803 --> 51:15.582
Well, take your party
somewhere else.

51:36.494 --> 51:38.172
What do you want? You
want the jewelry?

51:38.196 --> 51:40.474
Go ahead, take it! Just
get the hell out of here!

51:40.498 --> 51:42.576
No, first I want you to
answer my questions.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.546
After you hit a place,
you come back and watch.

51:45.570 --> 51:46.637
Why?

51:52.077 --> 51:53.254
Can I?

51:53.278 --> 51:54.345
Be my guest.

52:02.187 --> 52:05.299
I like to see how
they've changed.

52:05.323 --> 52:07.401
Changed?

52:07.425 --> 52:08.835
Changed how?

52:08.859 --> 52:11.072
I don't know.

52:11.096 --> 52:12.639
They've been going through life
thinking that the worst thing

52:12.663 --> 52:14.023
that'd ever happen
to them was that

52:14.047 --> 52:16.643
some stockbroker dumped them

52:16.667 --> 52:19.380
for his 20-year-old secretary,
and then I come along,

52:19.404 --> 52:23.450
and I teach them how bad
life really can get.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.786
It's addictive.

52:25.810 --> 52:28.455
So after I rob them, I go back,

52:28.479 --> 52:30.291
and I watch,

52:30.315 --> 52:31.625
but even if they do think
they see something,

52:31.649 --> 52:33.194
they think it's
just their nerves,

52:33.218 --> 52:34.818
or they call the cops,
and the cops think

52:34.842 --> 52:36.530
they're imagining things

52:36.554 --> 52:38.799
because why would I come
back just to watch?

52:38.823 --> 52:44.538
And that is an amazing
power trip, man.

52:44.562 --> 52:46.873
You ever get caught?

52:46.897 --> 52:51.312
Not usually.

52:51.336 --> 52:53.347
What does this got to do
with you anyway, man?

52:53.371 --> 52:54.881
The woman whose
house you were in

52:54.905 --> 52:57.518
last night, Arden Walsh?

52:57.542 --> 52:59.553
I need to undermine
her credibility.

52:59.577 --> 53:01.555
Okay.

53:01.579 --> 53:03.019
So I've arranged to
float some rumors

53:03.043 --> 53:06.088
about Arden maybe
using illegal drugs.

53:07.585 --> 53:09.105
So there's gonna be
a knock on her door

53:09.129 --> 53:10.497
in the morning by
the authorities.

53:10.521 --> 53:14.259
I want you to plant these
in her bedroom closet.

53:16.161 --> 53:17.438
Top shelf,

53:17.462 --> 53:18.772
way in the back,

53:18.796 --> 53:20.807
and you're gonna have
to do it tonight

53:20.831 --> 53:22.743
while she's asleep so that

53:22.767 --> 53:24.245
there's no chance she discovers
them before the police

53:24.269 --> 53:25.912
come a-knocking in the morning.

53:25.936 --> 53:27.896
So I got to go into her
bedroom while she's asleep

53:27.920 --> 53:29.683
and not wake her

53:29.707 --> 53:31.285
while I'm knocking
around her junk?

53:31.309 --> 53:33.354
Is that a problem?

53:33.378 --> 53:35.222
Oh, not really,

53:35.246 --> 53:38.692
but she has... she's got
a security system now.

53:38.716 --> 53:40.117
Oh.

53:43.954 --> 53:47.234
This is the code.

53:47.258 --> 53:49.427
Memorize it and burn it.

53:52.463 --> 53:55.132
Okay, compensation.

53:57.268 --> 53:59.188
There's a mirror image of
these on the other side

53:59.212 --> 54:01.247
when you finish.

54:07.645 --> 54:09.347
I guess it'll do.

54:12.617 --> 54:15.296
Hey, hey, one more thing.

54:15.320 --> 54:18.323
And this is not negotiable.

54:19.924 --> 54:22.336
Breaking into her house,
going into her bedroom

54:22.360 --> 54:24.871
while she's asleep is high risk.

54:24.895 --> 54:27.408
I'm not going back to prison.

54:27.432 --> 54:29.843
So if she wakes up,

54:29.867 --> 54:33.880
I got to do what I got to do.

54:33.904 --> 54:35.806
Fair enough.

57:40.558 --> 57:42.936
Leave her alone!

57:42.960 --> 57:44.538
Mommy!

57:44.562 --> 57:45.972
Go in your room and
lock the door!

58:02.480 --> 58:03.481
No, no, no.

58:17.795 --> 58:18.996
Mom?

58:21.599 --> 58:22.976
Are you okay?

58:23.000 --> 58:24.645
I'm okay. Are you okay?

58:24.669 --> 58:26.212
I'm fine.

58:26.236 --> 58:27.848
Wow.

58:27.872 --> 58:30.116
Mom, you kicked his butt.

58:31.976 --> 58:33.544
Yeah.

58:49.860 --> 58:51.805
Why?

58:51.829 --> 58:54.675
Because she needed to be tested.

58:54.699 --> 58:56.042
What is wrong with you?

58:56.066 --> 58:57.678
You son of a bitch, she...

58:57.702 --> 58:59.513
she broke my arm!

58:59.537 --> 59:01.214
Yeah.

59:01.238 --> 59:03.550
I taught her that move.

59:03.574 --> 59:04.642
Oh, you taught...

59:05.910 --> 59:07.754
Get out of my house!

59:07.778 --> 59:09.255
Get out.

59:09.279 --> 59:10.279
Get out.

59:44.782 --> 59:48.695
So the security company says
someone entered your residence,

59:48.719 --> 59:50.931
and they put the code
into the keypad.

59:50.955 --> 59:53.066
Okay, that's impossible.

59:53.090 --> 59:56.002
The security system's new.
Nobody has the code.

59:56.026 --> 59:59.973
Okay, you're sure that nobody
saw you punch in the code?

59:59.997 --> 01:00:02.142
Logan saw it.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:05.946
He saw it the other day
when we came to the house.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.314
Oh, my God. It's Logan.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:12.185
Somebody called me right when
the thief was in my bedroom.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.555
But what would his motive be?

01:00:14.579 --> 01:00:16.757
He's testing me.

01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:19.893
He's always testing me.

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:22.763
This is the kind of man this is.
He's dangerous.

01:00:22.787 --> 01:00:26.099
Look, we're taking this
very, very seriously,

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:28.034
but I have got to
do it by the book.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:29.836
While you do it by the
book, my daughter

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.337
and I are just
supposed to sit here

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.073
and wait for him to come back?

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:35.308
No, you reprogram the code,

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:37.911
and you keep your eyes open
for anything suspicious.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:40.947
You hear anything, you see
anything, you call us,

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:44.751
and for God's sake, don't
give your code to anybody.

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.152
Thank you.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:47.277
Change the code.

01:01:08.633 --> 01:01:10.210
Shh.

01:01:12.302 --> 01:01:14.981
This is enough, Logan.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.251
Please.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:21.054
The police and I both know
that you sent that thief back

01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:22.856
into my house for
the second time.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.357
That's right.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.326
I told you your
instincts are sharp.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.995
He attacked me.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.364
And you sent him home
with a broken arm.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:33.033
That's very impressive.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.902
Are you insane?

01:01:35.926 --> 01:01:37.303
He could have killed me.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.172
He could have hurt Emma.

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.197
No, no, no, no.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:45.278
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:46.847
Don't forget this, Arden.

01:01:46.871 --> 01:01:48.715
I taught you
everything you know.

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:50.419
I did not teach you
everything that I know.

01:01:50.443 --> 01:01:52.853
You're insane.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:55.055
You know I'm gonna
call the police.

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:56.657
Police aren't gonna
do anything for you,

01:01:56.681 --> 01:01:58.241
and that's what I'm
trying to teach you.

01:01:58.265 --> 01:01:59.860
You need to learn that
you need to fight

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.394
the big battles by yourself.

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:03.263
Please leave me alone.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:05.766
Please leave me alone.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.134
Arden, trust me.

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.136
Trust me.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.673
You don't want to wake up in the
middle of the night sweating

01:02:12.697 --> 01:02:15.141
because you couldn't
save your little girl.

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:17.377
You don't want that. You
don't want to have to know

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.279
that you're gonna watch
the person you love

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:22.949
the most on this earth die
right in front of you.

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:24.308
You don't want that, do you?

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.757
I passed your test. I did.

01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:32.759
Please, you don't...

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:36.129
you don't need to train
me anymore, okay?

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:37.463
Please.

01:02:40.024 --> 01:02:41.425
Yes, I do, Arden.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:46.006
I could have killed
you right here...

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:53.804
But we're just getting started.

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.083
Great backhand, guys.

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.142
Emma, run and grab that ball.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.320
Good job.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:36.489
- You got it?
- Whoo!

01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:39.225
- I got it.
- Cindy, good job.

01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:41.962
Detective Banks, it's...
it's Arden Walsh again.

01:03:41.986 --> 01:03:44.464
I just wanted to call and
see if you found Logan.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.933
Oh, Ms. Walsh, we sent
a car to his home.

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.168
We sent a car to his work,

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:49.102
and he's not at either place.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:50.937
So we're trying,

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:52.773
but we're not sure
where he is right now.

01:03:52.797 --> 01:03:54.597
Um, I'm concerned that
you might be in danger,

01:03:54.621 --> 01:03:56.342
and you shouldn't be
staying at your home.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:58.566
Do you have somewhere that you
and your daughter can go?

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:00.246
Yeah, I can stay with my sister.
I'm...

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.148
Well, stay with her, and as soon

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.972
as we bring this freak
in, we'll let you know.

01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:07.912
Thank you.

01:04:17.154 --> 01:04:18.431
Hello?

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:20.801
Arden? Are you okay?

01:04:20.825 --> 01:04:22.936
No, I'm not okay, Gwen.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.571
This whole thing is
making me super paranoid.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:29.442
I'm working a homicide
case up on Summit Avenue.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:32.212
Look, Arden, I think
I got your robber.

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:33.546
Why do you think that?

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.315
Bald guy, about 5'10",

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:36.382
broken arm.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:38.819
Yeah, I mean, it could be.

01:04:38.843 --> 01:04:41.988
Looks like he's got a makeshift
sling on his finger.

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:43.289
Maybe.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:44.891
But wait. Did you say homicide?

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.960
Wait. Is he dead?

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:50.130
His throat is crushed, Arden.
You didn't...

01:04:50.154 --> 01:04:51.865
No, no, no, no, no, no, I did...

01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:54.868
I didn't do anyth... I
beat him up pretty bad,

01:04:54.892 --> 01:04:57.070
but he ran out of here. I
mean, he was very much alive.

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:58.238
I...

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:00.273
I bet you it was Logan.

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:01.607
Oh, my God.

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.910
He had somebody
come in my house.

01:05:03.934 --> 01:05:05.378
Okay. Why would he do that?

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.547
I bet you he killed him too.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.449
I bet you he killed him
just to shut him up.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:10.483
Oh, my God.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:11.852
Okay, you know what?

01:05:11.876 --> 01:05:13.116
That's gonna be tough to prove.

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:17.190
He's a murderer, Gwen.

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.558
I knew he was dangerous.

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:20.493
I didn't know he was
capable of this.

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:22.362
He was...

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:24.497
he was in my back seat today.

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:26.632
Are you kidding me?

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:28.234
Are you okay?

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:29.569
I'm gonna be just fine.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.371
I just, uh...

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:32.515
I think he actually believes

01:05:32.539 --> 01:05:34.307
that he's still training me.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:36.476
Banks says she doesn't
even know where he is.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.580
I mean, he's so good, the
police can't even find him.

01:05:38.604 --> 01:05:40.280
You know what? This is bad.

01:05:40.304 --> 01:05:43.049
You and Emma have to come
to my house tonight.

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.317
Deal. Gwen, I need you

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.219
to go pick up Emma
from school, okay?

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:48.021
I'm gonna stay here. I'm
gonna pack a few things,

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:49.455
but I... I need you
to pick her up

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.119
and take her straight
to your house, okay?

01:05:51.143 --> 01:05:53.093
He's not gonna let up.

01:05:53.117 --> 01:05:54.660
He's not.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:57.030
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have to...

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:58.374
I'm gonna have to
find him myself.

01:05:58.398 --> 01:06:00.901
I c... I can't let
him test me again.

01:06:00.925 --> 01:06:03.036
I'm not gonna be
scared of him anymore.

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.139
I am not gonna be scared, Gwen.

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:08.074
No. No, Arden.

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:10.143
You have to stay away from him.

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:11.945
You have to promise me, Arden.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.504
Promise me you will let
the police do their job.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.475
Do you promise?

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.621
I love you.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:24.057
Arden, please. Let the p...

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.660
Good job, Cindy.

01:07:14.098 --> 01:07:15.199
Oh, my God.

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:33.359
Bring it in, everyone.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:35.661
Come on. Hustle up. Hustle up.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:37.130
Great job out there.

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:39.232
All right, good job.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:40.533
Guess what's next. All: What?

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:43.169
Time for some cross-country.
One lap.

01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:44.137
Come on.

01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:45.271
Get your racquet.

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.368
Put the racquets away. Let's go!

01:08:08.215 --> 01:08:09.295
High knees, high knees, go.

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:12.032
- Here we go.
- Come on.

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:34.444
Come on, Cindy.

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:37.581
Come on. You can do it.

01:09:00.413 --> 01:09:01.413
Come on, Cindy.

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:02.438
You're doing great.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.501
Emma? Emma!

01:10:07.314 --> 01:10:08.314
Are you Emma's mom?

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.682
Where is she?

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:10.816
The man, he took her

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840
and then gave me this.

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:17.181
Then they ran.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.393
Emma!

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.428
Cindy!

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:23.929
Okay, okay, look at me.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.432
- You're safe now.
- Emma!

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:28.534
Go to the coach.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.903
Wait, wait. Cindy, listen to me.

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:34.374
Tell them that Emma's mom
came and picked her up, okay?

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.376
- Are you sure?
- Emma!

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.743
Cindy! Where are you guys?

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:39.512
Yeah. I need you
to trust me, okay?

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:40.580
It's the only way we're
gonna keep her safe.

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:41.514
Come on back.

01:10:41.538 --> 01:10:42.538
Okay.

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:45.442
Over here!

01:10:56.253 --> 01:11:03.159
♪ ♪

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:06.806
Okay, okay.

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:43.400
Emma?

01:11:44.501 --> 01:11:45.869
Logan?

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:01.318
Emma?

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:06.790
Emma!

01:12:13.397 --> 01:12:14.674
Hey, Coach,

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:16.609
I'm here to pick up Emma.

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:19.645
Yeah.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.347
That's what we were
just talking about.

01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:23.383
Is there something wrong?

01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:24.717
Cindy told me Arden

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:26.519
already came by and
picked Emma up.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:28.688
Thing is, no one saw
her leaving with Emma.

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:30.690
Who did Emma go with, Cindy?

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:32.716
She went with her mom.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.697
We were doing our final
lap around the courts.

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:39.799
Emma and Cindy got
a little behind.

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:42.034
When I came back, Emma was gone.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:43.936
Cindy told me

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.472
Emma's mom picked her up
right there on the trail.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.041
No. Doesn't sound like Arden.

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:50.910
I checked in with
the front office.

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:52.778
There's no record of
her signing Emma out,

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.614
but some teachers said
they saw Arden run back

01:12:54.638 --> 01:12:56.349
to her car and take off.

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:59.509
Cindy, when was the last
time that you saw Emma?

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.312
Emma?

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:11.487
Emma?

01:13:14.023 --> 01:13:15.359
Emma?

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.077
What?

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.947
Oh, my God.

01:13:27.971 --> 01:13:30.416
Oh, my God.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.552
Oh, my God.

01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:33.877
What is this?

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:47.467
Logan, I'm here. Where's Emma?

01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.134
You haven't found me yet.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.003
You're just getting close.

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:52.672
What do you want from me?

01:13:52.696 --> 01:13:54.807
I... I don't know what
else you want from me.

01:13:54.831 --> 01:13:56.376
You... you're not training me.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.077
You killed the man
that attacked me.

01:13:58.101 --> 01:14:00.613
I... I don't know what
else to do here, okay?

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:02.648
Just tell me what to do.

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:04.517
Look.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.118
Look? Look where? I...

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:07.487
Look!

01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:08.921
Look where, Logan?

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:10.790
You don't understand.

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:12.825
There's one final test.

01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:15.828
But if you fail now, Emma dies.

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:19.499
Don't you put a
freaking hand on her.

01:14:19.523 --> 01:14:21.801
If you touch her, I swear to
God, Logan, I'll kill you.

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:23.536
Do you understand me?

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.538
No. You don't understand me.

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.607
I will kill her, Arden.

01:14:27.631 --> 01:14:28.898
Find me.

01:14:35.038 --> 01:14:37.883
Sweetheart, this is
really important.

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:41.153
Were you with Emma?

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:42.187
Cindy, what's going on?

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.757
I promised not to tell.

01:14:44.781 --> 01:14:46.426
You promised not to tell what?

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:48.093
Cindy, listen.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:50.563
You're not in any trouble, okay?

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.665
We all just want
Emma to be safe.

01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:53.966
So right now it's important

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.525
that you tell us the truth.

01:15:00.664 --> 01:15:02.742
This man came out of the
woods and took her.

01:15:02.766 --> 01:15:04.677
I was gonna tell you,

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:06.979
but Emma's mom said not
to or she might get hurt.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.843
- It's all right.
- Is she gonna get Emmy hurt?

01:15:08.867 --> 01:15:10.583
Hi, Gw... Gwen Walsh
from forensics,

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:12.652
I need, uh, Detective Banks
as soon as you can, please.

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:14.520
- Are you sure?
- Take her back to the office

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.024
and tell the school
to go on lockdown.

01:15:16.048 --> 01:15:17.189
Come on.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:18.213
It's all right.

01:15:21.485 --> 01:15:23.663
Detective Banks, my niece
has been kidnapped.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:25.898
I think Arden's been
dragged into it.

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:28.534
Let's get an APB out on
Logan Chase right away,

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:29.758
and we need to find Ms. Walsh.

01:15:29.782 --> 01:15:31.637
Her sister hasn't seen her.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:33.461
And Ms. Walsh is not
answering her cell phone.

01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:35.007
All right, we'll
send a patrol car

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:36.976
to Ms. Walsh's house.
Where are you gonna be?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.945
I think I'm gonna check out
Logan Chase's warehouse.

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:41.889
Ten-four. We'll let you
know if anyone spots him.

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:12.802
Mr. Chase, it's Detective Banks!

01:16:59.783 --> 01:17:00.950
Emma?

01:17:07.591 --> 01:17:09.902
Logan?

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:11.771
Logan?

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.308
Emma?

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:28.845
Logan?

01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:39.555
Emma!

01:17:42.926 --> 01:17:44.369
Get me out of here.

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:47.773
He... he took me from school.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:51.243
He... he... he took me and...

01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:52.778
- Okay, where is he?
- I don't know.

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:53.802
Arden?

01:17:57.807 --> 01:17:59.709
Go!

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:11.020
Go.

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:39.158
Stay down. Stay down.

01:18:39.182 --> 01:18:41.293
When I was lying on the
ground bleeding that day...

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:43.796
All I wanted to do was die.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:46.198
Shh.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:48.200
But then I realized

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:50.770
I had to stop what
happened to Marie

01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:53.438
from happening to other people.

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:56.632
I had to make sure that
people were prepared!

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:00.713
I had to help.

01:19:00.737 --> 01:19:01.947
I had a purpose again.

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.131
- Don't leave me alone.
- Shh.

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:07.286
You hate me now.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.188
Okay, I need you
to do me a favor.

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.890
I need you to stay right here, okay?
I want you to hide,

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:12.914
and don't come out of here
no matter what you hear.

01:19:12.938 --> 01:19:14.994
No, I'm coming with you.

01:19:15.018 --> 01:19:17.029
Look, I'm gonna
take care of this,

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:18.430
but the only way I can do that
is if I know that you're safe.

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:20.165
Stay right here.

01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:22.267
Okay, Mommy.

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:23.703
Look at me.

01:19:23.727 --> 01:19:24.961
Look at me.

01:19:27.463 --> 01:19:29.699
I've got this.

01:20:04.868 --> 01:20:06.135
This isn't what I want, Arden.

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:30.135
This is your final test, Arden.

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.796
You're gonna have to earn
your way out of this forest.

01:20:42.405 --> 01:20:44.416
But I won't hold back
or make it easy for you

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.877
because the world won't
make it easy for you.

01:21:09.332 --> 01:21:12.444
You disappointed me, Arden,

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:13.788
but I'll give you
one last chance.

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:18.074
Why don't you show
me what you got?

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.982
Mom, you did it!

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:04.120
Mommy, look out!

01:22:44.327 --> 01:22:46.939
I taught you, Arden.

01:22:46.963 --> 01:22:48.331
I taught you well.

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:01.044
Ms. Walsh, how are
you two doing?

01:23:05.548 --> 01:23:07.083
Tea?

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:14.490
Is it over now, Mommy?

01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:19.338
Yeah.

01:23:19.362 --> 01:23:22.231
Yeah, baby, it's over.

01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:39.058
Higher.

01:23:39.082 --> 01:23:40.525
Whoo, yeah.

01:23:40.549 --> 01:23:43.528
Great, that's what I...
that's exactly

01:23:43.552 --> 01:23:45.430
what I was talking about last week.
Good job.

01:23:45.454 --> 01:23:48.100
- Thank you.
- Good.

01:23:48.124 --> 01:23:49.969
Wow.

01:23:49.993 --> 01:23:52.037
Guys, this looks great.

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:53.861
You guys have been
practicing since last week.

01:23:53.885 --> 01:23:57.609
I'm impressed. It
looks really good.

01:23:57.633 --> 01:24:00.112
Um, look, I just wanted
to share with you, um,

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:02.296
well, when I first started
taking self-defense classes,

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.150
I came into the room

01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:10.089
feeling frightened and helpless.

01:24:10.113 --> 01:24:12.257
But I promise you if
you keep coming here,

01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:13.658
you will feel empowered.

01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:15.394
You will feel stronger.

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:17.098
I also want to remind
you that the strength

01:24:17.122 --> 01:24:19.231
doesn't come from here.

01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:22.267
It comes from here, right?

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:24.451
It's about rediscovering the
confidence and the courage

01:24:24.475 --> 01:24:26.138
that you've had
inside all along.

01:24:26.162 --> 01:24:27.739
Okay, so let's do it again.

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:29.074
Come on.

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:34.370
Yes, great.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.141
Exactly.
