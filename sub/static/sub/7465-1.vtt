03:21.330 --> 03:24.920
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

03:25.130 --> 03:29.430
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

03:29.630 --> 03:34.140
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

03:37.180 --> 03:41.690
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

03:41.900 --> 03:46.230
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.400
Some people say,
reformers here say:

03:48.610 --> 03:52.570
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

03:52.780 --> 03:56.240
What I hope I'm doing, and here's
where your paper's got a point,

03:56.450 --> 03:58.750
is I'm responding to
the will of the people.

04:01.710 --> 04:06.300
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

04:06.510 --> 04:09.300
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

04:09.510 --> 04:13.300
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

04:13.510 --> 04:15.760
I'm a businessman.

04:17.310 --> 04:20.980
Your reputation is that you control
your business through violence.

04:21.190 --> 04:25.820
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.320
It's all right.

04:34.780 --> 04:36.700
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.750
We used to say, "Y ou can get further
with a kind word and a gun"

04:39.960 --> 04:43.040
"than you can
with just a kind word."

04:44.380 --> 04:46.630
And in that neighbourhood
it might've been true.

04:46.840 --> 04:50.420
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.590
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me

04:54.800 --> 04:59.100
and not by anybody I employ.
Because it's not good business.

05:30.090 --> 05:34.590
<i>Leave us alone down here,</i>
<i>we've got everything we need.</i>

05:34.800 --> 05:37.800
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

05:38.010 --> 05:42.230
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

05:43.390 --> 05:46.150
I'm not buyin' any.

05:48.230 --> 05:52.190
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.240
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

05:58.450 --> 06:02.500
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.920
Oh, she does?

06:06.080 --> 06:09.290
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

06:15.130 --> 06:16.890
- There you go.
- Thank you.

06:17.090 --> 06:22.390
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.020
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that...

06:25.230 --> 06:27.770
Hey, Mister! Wait!

06:27.980 --> 06:31.360
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief...

07:36.670 --> 07:41.090
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.680
I know.

07:43.890 --> 07:47.140
Now it's time to go to work.

07:55.150 --> 07:58.450
You'll make a good first impression.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.290
I love you, Eliot.

08:14.670 --> 08:16.000
Now, shoo.

08:17.800 --> 08:23.430
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.140
- Mr Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

08:26.350 --> 08:29.680
At the request
of the City of Chicago,

08:29.890 --> 08:33.650
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme

08:33.860 --> 08:37.400
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

08:37.610 --> 08:41.400
Mr Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

08:41.610 --> 08:44.450
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working

08:44.660 --> 08:46.700
with the Chicago Police...

08:46.910 --> 08:49.120
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

08:49.330 --> 08:53.500
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr Ness?

08:53.710 --> 08:57.590
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.010
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

09:01.220 --> 09:02.630
It is the law of the land.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.600
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

09:05.800 --> 09:08.140
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

09:08.350 --> 09:10.730
Do you have any political ambitions?

09:10.930 --> 09:13.650
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

09:16.060 --> 09:19.280
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

09:19.480 --> 09:21.570
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

09:21.780 --> 09:25.450
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

09:25.660 --> 09:28.910
Mr Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.080
Are you ready to meet the men?

09:33.460 --> 09:35.500
Yes, I am.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.310
I have one more thing to say.

09:52.100 --> 09:55.440
I know that many of you take a drink.

09:55.650 --> 09:59.520
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

09:59.730 --> 10:03.280
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

10:04.650 --> 10:09.080
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.870
But it's against the law.

10:11.080 --> 10:15.330
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.710
Are there any questions?

10:24.090 --> 10:27.470
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had

10:27.680 --> 10:29.810
a man undercover here
for some time now.

10:30.010 --> 10:32.060
We've received word
from this informant

10:32.270 --> 10:35.770
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

10:35.980 --> 10:38.690
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

10:46.740 --> 10:51.370
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

10:51.580 --> 10:54.830
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

10:55.040 --> 10:59.630
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

10:59.840 --> 11:04.210
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

11:11.140 --> 11:14.640
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.480
- How are we doin'
- Okay.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.950
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

11:39.420 --> 11:42.130
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

11:44.130 --> 11:47.920
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

11:49.300 --> 11:53.010
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

11:58.890 --> 12:01.730
A message from my wife.

12:02.810 --> 12:06.230
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.240
Nice to be married, huh?

12:26.340 --> 12:28.220
Just follow me.

13:10.260 --> 13:13.050
- Oh, God...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.600
Get 'em up. Drop it.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.390
Damn it, I can't , it'll break.

13:19.470 --> 13:21.980
Mr Ness. Look, I was just...

13:22.190 --> 13:24.230
Geez, I'm sorry.

13:26.230 --> 13:29.990
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.400
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

13:32.610 --> 13:37.120
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

13:37.330 --> 13:39.540
Okay. Just shut up.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.940
All right now...
Let's do some good!

14:22.830 --> 14:24.330
Hold it right there!

14:26.920 --> 14:31.590
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

14:40.470 --> 14:43.520
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

14:45.310 --> 14:47.520
Preseuski.

14:48.610 --> 14:51.730
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

14:51.940 --> 14:54.860
- Mr Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.620
Let him through here.

14:59.740 --> 15:02.950
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.460
- You ready?
- Ready.

15:32.570 --> 15:34.610
Liquor, huh?

15:37.070 --> 15:39.070
Get him out of here.

15:39.280 --> 15:43.370
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

15:47.960 --> 15:50.540
That means you, too.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.260
Christ!

17:15.589 --> 17:19.300
Now, what do you think you're doing?

17:19.510 --> 17:24.390
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

17:24.589 --> 17:27.810
Don't you have
more important things to do?

17:28.060 --> 17:30.180
Yeah.

17:30.390 --> 17:32.980
But I'm not doing them right now.

17:34.060 --> 17:36.860
Do we understand each other?

17:40.240 --> 17:42.990
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

17:44.410 --> 17:48.240
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.370
All right.

17:53.580 --> 17:57.290
Just remember
what we talked about now.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.680
Hey... Wait a minute!

18:03.880 --> 18:07.640
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn citÃ½?

18:07.850 --> 18:10.720
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

18:10.930 --> 18:14.690
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

18:14.900 --> 18:18.020
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

18:23.900 --> 18:26.990
What's your name and unit?

18:30.700 --> 18:33.330
It's right here.

18:34.750 --> 18:38.130
You got a beef?
What is it?

18:40.550 --> 18:43.590
How did you know I had a gun?

18:43.800 --> 18:47.590
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

18:49.970 --> 18:51.310
No.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.600
Are you okay, pal?

18:58.400 --> 19:01.150
I had a rough day on the job.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.860
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

19:08.820 --> 19:12.830
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.880
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.210
Here endeth the lesson.

20:22.360 --> 20:27.190
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.490
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.660
55 gallons to the barrel.

20:47.550 --> 20:50.260
- It's Eddie.
- <i>Come in, Eddie.</i>

21:14.370 --> 21:20.040
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good" .

21:20.250 --> 21:22.670
And then, we bust through...

22:11.630 --> 22:15.260
- Mr Ness?
- Yes?

22:15.470 --> 22:18.810
I came here to thank you.

22:19.010 --> 22:20.430
It was...

22:20.640 --> 22:24.440
..my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.770
I'm sorry. Please.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.940
I'm ...l'm so sorry.

22:33.030 --> 22:37.950
You see, it's ...because I know
that you have children, too.

22:39.030 --> 22:44.290
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.210
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.090
And you do that, now.

23:48.100 --> 23:51.400
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

23:53.650 --> 23:55.780
Come in.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.160
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

24:02.370 --> 24:06.330
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

24:07.330 --> 24:12.750
- Now, how can <i>I help you?</i>
- Just work with me.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.550
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

24:18.010 --> 24:20.640
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

24:21.430 --> 24:23.850
If I'm such a good cop...

24:25.140 --> 24:28.140
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

24:28.350 --> 24:30.270
Do you want to tell me?

24:30.480 --> 24:33.360
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

24:33.570 --> 24:37.320
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

24:37.530 --> 24:39.530
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

24:39.740 --> 24:43.490
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

24:43.700 --> 24:48.040
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.710
I'm askin' you for help.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.670
Well...that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

25:03.390 --> 25:08.680
Mr Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and...twenty pounds ago.

25:08.890 --> 25:14.610
But...I just think it got...
more important to me...

25:14.820 --> 25:16.530
..to stay alive.

25:23.820 --> 25:27.830
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

25:42.180 --> 25:45.800
<i>That's good, Andy. Let's start up</i>
<i>the thing and take a little ride.</i>

25:46.010 --> 25:48.560
<i>I wanna hear</i>
<i>that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!</i>

25:48.770 --> 25:52.100
- <i>Yeah, let me open the door here.</i>
- <i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

25:52.310 --> 25:55.730
<i>Whoopsy daisy,</i>
<i>pick up the door there, Andy.</i>

25:55.940 --> 25:59.860
<i>Throw it in the back seat.</i>
<i>Now, let me get the thing started.</i>

26:00.070 --> 26:02.110
<i>Yeah, start it up, Andy.</i>

26:09.080 --> 26:12.160
<i>Holy mackerel, Andy!</i>
<i>Listen to that Bearcat motor!</i>

26:12.370 --> 26:17.090
<i>Yeah, it sounds like the bear</i>
<i>is chasin' that cat all round it!</i>

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
<i>Andy! She's boilin' over!</i>

26:31.850 --> 26:34.770
- Mr Ness?
- Yes.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.400
Oscar Wallace.

26:39.230 --> 26:42.320
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

26:42.530 --> 26:44.780
- Really?
- Yes.

26:44.990 --> 26:49.700
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr Wallace. Would you excuse me?

26:50.790 --> 26:53.620
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have...

26:53.830 --> 26:55.790
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.880
And the one I want to try first...
is this.

27:03.470 --> 27:07.550
He has not filed a return since 1926.

27:09.100 --> 27:12.770
- A return...?
- An income tax return.

27:14.270 --> 27:15.770
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

27:15.980 --> 27:20.400
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.610
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here...

27:26.700 --> 27:28.910
Would you excuse me?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.660
Please.

28:00.230 --> 28:02.690
Okay. Let's go.

28:02.900 --> 28:06.820
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

28:09.570 --> 28:13.740
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

28:16.080 --> 28:20.460
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

28:20.670 --> 28:25.260
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

28:25.460 --> 28:28.430
And then what are you
prepared to do?

28:28.630 --> 28:31.010
If you open the ball
on these people,

28:31.220 --> 28:33.760
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

28:33.970 --> 28:37.140
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

28:37.350 --> 28:39.440
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

28:39.640 --> 28:44.520
Here's how you get Capone:
he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

28:44.730 --> 28:47.490
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

28:47.690 --> 28:51.320
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

28:53.620 --> 28:56.830
Now, do you want to do that?

28:57.040 --> 28:59.750
Are you ready to do that?

29:01.370 --> 29:05.380
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

29:06.420 --> 29:08.840
I have sworn to put this man away,

29:09.050 --> 29:14.220
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

29:22.060 --> 29:25.400
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

29:32.570 --> 29:35.780
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr Ness?

29:35.990 --> 29:38.950
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.210
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

29:44.420 --> 29:48.050
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

29:48.260 --> 29:51.720
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

29:51.930 --> 29:56.430
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

29:56.640 --> 30:01.390
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

30:01.600 --> 30:04.600
Because I swore to uphold the law.

30:04.810 --> 30:07.650
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

30:07.860 --> 30:12.110
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

30:12.320 --> 30:16.410
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

30:16.620 --> 30:21.460
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

30:21.660 --> 30:24.000
Get it off the tree.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.590
Get it off the tree...

30:28.880 --> 30:32.050
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

30:32.260 --> 30:35.430
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

30:35.640 --> 30:37.050
About face!

30:37.260 --> 30:41.020
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr Eliot Ness.

30:41.220 --> 30:45.020
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

30:45.230 --> 30:49.860
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full...

30:50.070 --> 30:53.320
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

30:53.530 --> 30:58.450
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

30:58.660 --> 31:01.080
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.870
- Good.
- <i>Williamson!</i>

31:04.080 --> 31:08.590
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

31:09.880 --> 31:13.300
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

31:13.510 --> 31:17.930
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and...

31:18.140 --> 31:20.850
To protect and serve...
To protect and...

31:21.060 --> 31:25.230
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.440
- What I think? I...
- You...

31:28.650 --> 31:31.780
...could help...the force.

31:32.650 --> 31:35.780
- You can help...
- With the force.

31:35.990 --> 31:40.620
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

31:47.210 --> 31:48.710
At ease!

31:48.920 --> 31:52.210
Stone! Out here.

31:53.710 --> 31:56.510
This kid's a prodigy.

31:58.510 --> 32:02.760
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and...

32:02.970 --> 32:05.930
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.190
Where are you from, Stone?

32:11.440 --> 32:14.780
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

32:14.990 --> 32:17.990
George Stone, that's your name?

32:19.740 --> 32:23.830
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.370
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

32:30.170 --> 32:33.090
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

32:33.300 --> 32:36.210
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

32:37.380 --> 32:39.050
What's that you said?

32:39.260 --> 32:43.050
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

32:45.930 --> 32:49.100
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

32:50.900 --> 32:53.110
Oh, I like him.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.320
Yeah, I like him, too.

32:59.030 --> 33:01.820
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.330
Yeah, okay.

33:06.660 --> 33:08.790
Eliot Ness.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.920
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and...

33:13.130 --> 33:15.880
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

33:23.260 --> 33:25.220
What do you think?

33:25.430 --> 33:28.680
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

33:28.890 --> 33:33.730
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

33:33.940 --> 33:37.480
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

33:37.690 --> 33:39.490
We need another man.

33:39.690 --> 33:41.910
Mr Ness? This is very interesting.

33:42.110 --> 33:46.200
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu...

33:46.410 --> 33:48.370
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

33:48.580 --> 33:50.620
Carry a gun.

34:07.180 --> 34:09.600
- Jimmy...?
- What?

34:11.770 --> 34:14.480
What the hell are you dressed for?
Hallowe'en?

34:14.650 --> 34:16.520
Shut up. I'm working.

34:16.730 --> 34:18.280
Where? The circus?

34:39.840 --> 34:42.590
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

34:42.800 --> 34:44.889
Liquor raid.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.050
Here?!

34:48.260 --> 34:52.560
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

34:52.770 --> 34:57.730
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

35:04.910 --> 35:07.780
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

35:13.330 --> 35:17.670
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.840
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

35:21.050 --> 35:22.510
Yes, I do.

35:23.470 --> 35:25.840
Good. Give me that axe.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.520
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

35:37.730 --> 35:40.020
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

35:41.110 --> 35:43.240
- Everybody...
- What are you doin' here?

35:43.440 --> 35:47.200
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

35:47.410 --> 35:51.200
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

35:51.410 --> 35:55.040
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

35:56.670 --> 35:59.710
How do you think he feels now?
Better...or worse?

36:08.510 --> 36:10.890
- What is that?
- What is <i>that?</i>

36:11.100 --> 36:14.270
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

36:14.470 --> 36:19.480
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

36:19.690 --> 36:24.150
<i>Il Santo Jude.</i>
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.070
And policemen.

36:27.240 --> 36:31.780
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

36:32.870 --> 36:36.160
Lost causes, policemen...

36:36.370 --> 36:39.960
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

36:40.170 --> 36:42.000
- You do?
- Yes.

36:42.210 --> 36:44.420
Why?

36:44.630 --> 36:49.260
'To protect the property
and the citizenry...'

36:50.930 --> 36:53.810
Whoa, it's all right.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.520
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

36:56.730 --> 37:00.520
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

37:00.730 --> 37:03.610
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

37:03.820 --> 37:06.440
Anything you say, Mr Ness.

37:06.650 --> 37:10.700
Closer in... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.000
Life goes on.

37:24.090 --> 37:29.220
A man becomes preeminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

37:29.420 --> 37:31.470
Enthusiasms...

37:32.640 --> 37:35.350
Enthusiasms...

37:36.720 --> 37:38.680
What are mine?

37:39.680 --> 37:43.690
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

37:43.900 --> 37:47.150
- Dames!
- Boozin'

37:49.820 --> 37:52.110
Baseball!

37:58.200 --> 38:00.660
A man...

38:00.870 --> 38:04.210
A man stands alone at the plate.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.840
This is the time for what?

38:09.800 --> 38:12.550
For individual achievement.

38:14.050 --> 38:16.260
There he stands alone.

38:17.350 --> 38:19.640
But in the field, what?

38:20.730 --> 38:23.100
Part of a team.

38:23.850 --> 38:26.570
Teamwork...

38:29.190 --> 38:34.990
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

38:36.160 --> 38:41.410
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

38:43.170 --> 38:47.210
If his team don't field...what is he?

38:49.460 --> 38:51.300
You follow me?

38:51.510 --> 38:54.220
No one.

38:54.380 --> 38:59.510
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

39:01.520 --> 39:05.150
I'm goin' out there for myself.

39:05.350 --> 39:11.860
But...I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

39:12.070 --> 39:14.360
- Team!
- Team.

39:21.120 --> 39:23.160
Jesus Christ!

39:46.600 --> 39:49.230
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

39:49.440 --> 39:52.820
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

39:53.030 --> 39:55.820
'lf I should die before I wake'

39:56.030 --> 39:59.410
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

39:59.620 --> 40:01.540
- Amen.
- God bless...

40:01.740 --> 40:05.710
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

40:05.910 --> 40:07.920
Amen.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.720
Good night.

40:18.930 --> 40:20.970
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

40:21.180 --> 40:25.020
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

40:34.990 --> 40:37.780
- Where are you going?
- What?

40:40.240 --> 40:41.740
Where are you going?

40:41.950 --> 40:44.790
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.250
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.590
And you've still got
some energy left?

40:51.790 --> 40:53.500
Oh, a lot of work.

40:53.710 --> 40:59.340
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'

41:13.150 --> 41:16.940
- How are we doin'
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

41:17.150 --> 41:21.570
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn

41:21.780 --> 41:25.700
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings...

41:25.910 --> 41:28.540
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

41:28.750 --> 41:31.330
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

41:31.540 --> 41:35.170
...Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs...the list is endless!

41:35.380 --> 41:39.090
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

41:39.300 --> 41:42.300
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show

41:42.510 --> 41:46.640
that any of the 'organisation'
business money is going to him.

41:46.850 --> 41:51.060
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

41:51.270 --> 41:54.820
- Mr Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

41:55.020 --> 41:58.110
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman...

41:58.320 --> 42:00.200
Yes, I know who you are.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.830
Would you excuse us?

42:07.830 --> 42:11.750
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

42:11.960 --> 42:15.170
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

42:16.840 --> 42:21.130
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

42:24.930 --> 42:26.560
What's that?

42:31.520 --> 42:34.520
- What is that?
- Mr Ness, you're an educated man.

42:34.730 --> 42:38.190
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

42:38.400 --> 42:44.200
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

42:45.280 --> 42:50.040
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

42:50.250 --> 42:53.250
Would you come in here, please?

42:57.590 --> 43:02.420
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

43:02.630 --> 43:04.840
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag

43:05.050 --> 43:08.680
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

43:08.890 --> 43:13.270
You tell your master
that we must agree to...disagree!

43:14.730 --> 43:17.940
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

43:18.150 --> 43:22.740
You fellows are 'untouchable'
is that it? No one can get to you?

43:22.940 --> 43:26.320
You tell Capone...
that I'll see him in hell.

43:29.530 --> 43:31.540
Hey! Nice house!

43:31.750 --> 43:34.580
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

43:36.250 --> 43:39.880
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

43:40.090 --> 43:42.050
Yes.

43:42.260 --> 43:44.510
Nice to have a family.

43:47.220 --> 43:49.930
Yes, it is.

43:50.140 --> 43:54.640
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

44:09.620 --> 44:11.580
Catherine?!

44:13.080 --> 44:14.960
Catherine!

44:15.160 --> 44:17.620
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

44:30.470 --> 44:34.180
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

44:34.390 --> 44:39.440
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

44:51.200 --> 44:53.620
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

44:53.830 --> 44:56.120
Okay, let's go.

44:56.330 --> 45:00.130
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

45:01.880 --> 45:05.420
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

45:05.630 --> 45:09.010
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

45:10.470 --> 45:15.020
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

45:15.220 --> 45:17.480
Take off your hat.

45:17.680 --> 45:21.020
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

45:21.230 --> 45:23.440
Yes, Mr Ness.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.400
Kiss.

45:28.610 --> 45:31.740
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

45:35.290 --> 45:37.330
Now, go!

45:59.390 --> 46:01.060
Malone!

46:02.150 --> 46:03.610
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

46:03.810 --> 46:07.190
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

46:07.400 --> 46:10.610
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

46:10.820 --> 46:13.780
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

46:13.990 --> 46:17.490
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

46:17.700 --> 46:20.160
A huge international
shipment's coming.

46:20.370 --> 46:24.960
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

46:25.170 --> 46:28.260
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

46:29.340 --> 46:31.340
How do you come by this information?

46:31.550 --> 46:33.680
That's the second rule
of police work:

46:33.890 --> 46:36.640
if you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

46:42.350 --> 46:45.190
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

46:45.400 --> 46:47.980
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

46:48.190 --> 46:50.440
If we can establish
any payments to him,

46:50.650 --> 46:53.700
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

46:53.910 --> 46:55.240
What?

46:55.450 --> 46:59.790
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

47:00.000 --> 47:03.330
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

47:03.540 --> 47:06.590
Well, it's better than nothing.

47:06.790 --> 47:10.800
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

47:11.880 --> 47:13.930
I don't know.

47:15.550 --> 47:18.050
Go to sleep, Oscar.

48:04.770 --> 48:07.980
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey

48:08.190 --> 48:11.860
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organisation.

48:12.070 --> 48:15.650
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

48:15.860 --> 48:21.740
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

48:21.950 --> 48:25.160
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

48:25.370 --> 48:29.290
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

48:29.500 --> 48:32.630
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

48:32.840 --> 48:36.630
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.840
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

48:39.050 --> 48:43.720
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr Ness, is half the battle.

48:43.930 --> 48:47.140
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

48:47.350 --> 48:51.690
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

48:51.900 --> 48:54.400
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

48:54.610 --> 48:56.820
Thank you, Captain.

48:58.610 --> 49:01.700
All right! Move out!

49:19.090 --> 49:21.850
Take it easy.

49:22.600 --> 49:26.430
Take it easy!
lt'll all happen in time.

49:27.770 --> 49:30.150
This is the job.

49:30.350 --> 49:34.020
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

49:34.230 --> 49:36.860
Just watch what does happen.

49:38.070 --> 49:40.110
Are you my 'tutor'?

49:41.320 --> 49:44.160
Yes, sir, that I am.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.830
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

49:50.040 --> 49:52.130
Then leave it alone.

49:52.790 --> 49:55.380
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

49:55.590 --> 49:59.220
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

50:01.640 --> 50:05.720
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

50:05.930 --> 50:09.020
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

50:09.230 --> 50:12.310
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

50:12.520 --> 50:16.860
Stitches and standing in the rain...

50:46.050 --> 50:48.270
Listen, Mr Ness...

50:50.140 --> 50:51.770
I had an idea.

51:47.240 --> 51:50.330
You all have your spare shells?

52:04.760 --> 52:09.350
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

52:09.550 --> 52:12.470
And put your man down.

52:14.980 --> 52:17.690
Because he'll do the same to you.

52:17.850 --> 52:20.110
Shoot to kill.

52:20.320 --> 52:24.650
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

52:26.240 --> 52:28.700
Let's go.

52:52.180 --> 52:53.560
Easy...

52:53.770 --> 52:57.390
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

52:57.600 --> 53:01.190
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

53:01.400 --> 53:03.110
George, the count's right.

53:03.320 --> 53:06.610
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

53:06.820 --> 53:09.530
Malone, you and I will
take the men...

53:09.700 --> 53:12.620
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

53:12.830 --> 53:16.330
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

53:17.290 --> 53:18.620
Charge!

53:20.830 --> 53:22.750
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'

53:26.050 --> 53:30.010
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

53:30.220 --> 53:32.180
Move, move!

53:41.690 --> 53:44.020
Let's go!

53:48.360 --> 53:49.700
I can't believe it!

53:49.910 --> 53:52.950
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.950
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

54:13.800 --> 54:15.680
Stone, take the first car!

54:17.390 --> 54:19.850
Get this shit out of the way!

54:39.500 --> 54:40.870
Tough guy!

54:44.210 --> 54:45.840
Stone!

54:46.040 --> 54:47.420
Go!

54:49.170 --> 54:51.090
Stone!

54:52.180 --> 54:53.510
I'm okay.

54:55.050 --> 54:57.100
You thugs!

55:11.280 --> 55:13.530
You all right?

55:13.740 --> 55:16.620
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

55:29.250 --> 55:33.340
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

55:33.550 --> 55:37.260
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

55:38.390 --> 55:40.470
Hello.

57:02.600 --> 57:04.060
All right! Drop the gun!

57:04.270 --> 57:06.770
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

57:07.850 --> 57:09.900
I said, drop it!

57:11.770 --> 57:13.320
Stop!

57:18.320 --> 57:21.580
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

57:21.780 --> 57:23.950
What are you, deaf?!

57:25.200 --> 57:27.250
What is this, a game?!

57:52.940 --> 57:55.280
Here. Sit down.

58:04.030 --> 58:06.750
Stone's gonna be all right.

58:06.950 --> 58:09.920
I got the fellow with the satchel.

58:16.550 --> 58:18.920
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

58:19.130 --> 58:21.970
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

58:23.300 --> 58:26.970
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

58:27.180 --> 58:31.770
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

58:31.980 --> 58:35.230
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

58:35.440 --> 58:39.110
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

58:39.320 --> 58:42.990
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

58:43.200 --> 58:46.580
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

58:46.790 --> 58:49.790
Why don't you kiss my ass?

58:50.000 --> 58:52.210
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

58:52.420 --> 58:54.500
- You've broken the law...
- Eliot!

58:54.710 --> 58:56.750
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

58:56.960 --> 59:00.010
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

59:00.220 --> 59:02.970
- Eliot!
- What?!

59:03.180 --> 59:05.550
Look at this!

59:05.760 --> 59:08.600
- Look at this!
- What is this?

59:10.810 --> 59:12.640
What is this?

59:13.400 --> 59:17.190
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

59:17.400 --> 59:21.650
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'

59:23.320 --> 59:26.660
And you got a heading here...
'Circuit Court'

59:26.870 --> 59:30.540
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court' What is this?

59:30.750 --> 59:33.710
Nothin' There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

59:33.920 --> 59:37.250
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

59:37.460 --> 59:39.250
then we can put Capone away.

59:39.460 --> 59:43.180
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

59:43.380 --> 59:46.140
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

59:46.340 --> 59:48.810
Translate this ledger for us!

59:49.010 --> 59:50.560
- In hell.
- In hell?!

59:51.930 --> 59:55.520
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

59:55.730 --> 59:59.360
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

59:59.570 --> 01:00:01.320
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:08.160
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.290
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:13.290
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.580
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:22.550
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.090
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.300
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:30.680
I'm gonna count to three.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.140
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:39.560
One.

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.700
Two!

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.160
Three.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.700
I'm gonna talk!

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:56.500
Don't ! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:03.380
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:06.630
Now, ask him what you want to know.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:11.010
All right... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:15.350
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete...

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.060
Mister Ness!

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.450
I do not approve of your methods!

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:32.330
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.790
- What?
- They got the shipment.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.540
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:45.710
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate...

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.850
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:56.640
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

01:01:56.850 --> 01:02:00.060
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.560
I want to piss on his ashes!

01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:08.030
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.490
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.660
- Yes.
- Like what?

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.870
Like what his name is.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.250
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.960
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:28.050
No...it'll be Edgar.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:33.140
- It'll be J. Edgar...
- I don't think so.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.100
God, you're beautiful.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.190
You should have seen us last night.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:48.400
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

01:02:48.610 --> 01:02:51.860
I know. I understand, I do.

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:56.280
Just tell me, are you being careful?

01:02:56.490 --> 01:03:00.000
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:02.370
- Progress?
- Yes?

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.750
Mrs Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:19.890
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:25.020
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:28.780
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.110
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.410
Mr Capone could have
up to 28 years.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.790
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:50.630
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.970
- We'll call, let it ring...
- Twice.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.090
- We'll call...
- From the corner.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.890
- Anybody knocks on the door...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.100
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:05.100
Much more diverting
than accounting.

01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:07.480
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:11.150
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:19.580
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.040
Okay, we see yous tonight.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:26.000
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:37.760
...he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:43.680
For which I must commend
the excellent work

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:47.560
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:52.530
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.700
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.870
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.450
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:06.120
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:10.670
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.170
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.970
Mr Burns, where's Mr Wallace?

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:23.680
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.730
- You keep an eye out at all times...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.400
They are going to...

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:42.780
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.290
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:34.630
Oh, no.

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.800
- No, no!
- Easy... Easy!

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.840
Oscar.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.090
Oh, Jesus.

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.600
You gonna be all right?

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:55.880
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:00.090
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:03.930
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:06.260
Jimmy!

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:10.140
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:12.390
You know what I mean?

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:31.410
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr Capone...

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.120
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr Capone...

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.210
I said...

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.140
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:50.100
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.310
Now he does.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.859
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.399
That's it, come on!

01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:05.200
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:09.410
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:11.490
- What?
- Easy.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.250
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.210
Easy. It's me. It's me!

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.130
Not this way.

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:26.050
You fuck, you got nothin'
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:31.930
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:36.520
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin' you punk!

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:48.990
Well, no, I understand.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.080
Believe me, I understand.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.880
Well, what's happened?

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:07.970
He says he can't be unprotected.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.430
What is it that the guy says?

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.220
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:18.770
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:23.230
So tomorrow morning the D.A. will
announce that he's dropping the case.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:27.320
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:30.240
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:34.080
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.200
Hello?

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:41.290
Hello.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.920
Yes.

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.130
No, he didn't have a family.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.310
How is everything there?

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.060
No, you do it however you want.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:07.360
I promise I will.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.780
You give her my love.

01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:13.030
I love you, too.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.330
Mr Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:24.500
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
- I think that's enough for today.

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:28.760
- If we don't stay on top...
- That'll do. Thank you.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.880
I'd like to request to stick around.

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.640
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.610
Is that it?

01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:51.320
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:53.990
My question is, are we done?

01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:58.370
Yes, I think we're done.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.460
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.040
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr Wallace.

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.540
He's dead! And the D.A.
is gonna drop the case!

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:09.050
He will not go into court
without a witness

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:12.220
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:17.260
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:20.220
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.330
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was...

01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:42.200
- My wife?
- Yeah.

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:49.040
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.720
It's nice being married, eh?

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:56.300
Yes.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:59.810
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:04.310
going over...
kitchen colour charts or something.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:16.660
Some part of the world still cares
what colour the kitchen is.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.500
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.460
Get back to the D.A. and stall him.

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:36.340
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.180
I think I know how to find this guy.

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:47.020
Walter?

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:52.230
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.360
We're leavin' tonight.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.740
Two ball, down.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.830
Mike, you got a minute?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.710
I do now, don't I?

01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:15.090
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:18.630
This is a place for cops.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.430
Can we step outside?

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.970
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:35.730
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:40.820
What? What?!

01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:44.120
I just need one more
piece of information.

01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:46.290
One more? Jimmy!

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:51.540
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:58.630
Are you crazy? Y ou're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.840
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:07.640
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:10.100
And I tried to save your life.

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:15.570
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:18.940
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:24.160
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:28.580
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:34.330
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:41.800
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:46.010
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:50.350
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.600
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:57.360
I'm gonna turn you over!

01:15:57.570 --> 01:16:01.110
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.120
You're dead.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.390
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.430
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.070
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.320
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

01:16:47.530 --> 01:16:50.040
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.830
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool...

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.670
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.460
I have men out there
risking more than that.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:02.170
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:07.340
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:11.470
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.270
<i>He's at the D.A. 's.</i>

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.390
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:37.420
- Al! Al!
- Mr Capone!

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:42.050
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:46.380
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:50.640
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole'

01:17:50.850 --> 01:17:54.100
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:55.730
You understand?

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.060
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:04.030
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:10.700
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:13.540
To speak to me like men? No.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.660
To harass a peaceful man.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.130
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:23.710
I would have
just a little more self respect.

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:30.260
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:33.430
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.310
Isn't that just like a wop?

01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:27.230
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:34.070
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:37.570
Go on, get your ass out of here!

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.550
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.390
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.020
Round the back.

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:38.780
Malone!

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.740
Malone.

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:14.270
Goddamn! Stone!

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.980
Stone!

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.610
The phone!

01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:27.280
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:33.750
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.880
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:40.670
This? You want this?

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.760
You want this?

01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:55.440
What?

01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:04.610
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.910
- Book...
- The bookkeeper?

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.330
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.830
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.130
He's on this train.

01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:21.710
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.180
No. Malone. No.

01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:30.140
Stay. Stay.

01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:32.770
Stay! Malone...

01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:35.020
No. No, no!

01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:40.320
Not this... Not this man...

01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:10.600
Train's leavin' for Miami
12.05, Mr Ness.

01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:14.350
We'll be there.

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.940
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:22.900
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:33.450 --> 01:26:35.580
Cover the south entrance.

01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:26.800
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:35.260
<i>Your attention, please. The Miami</i>
<i>Flier departs at 12.05 from 33.</i>

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:37.520

01:30:57.090 --> 01:31:02.550
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:06.180
Are you all right? Thank you.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:10.850
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:15.070
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:21.660
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:25.950
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

01:31:30.330 --> 01:31:34.130
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:39.630
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:43.680
Thank you, sir.

01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:55.980
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:59.280
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:06.910
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:12.710
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.130
Is something wrong?

01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:18.710
Sir?

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.210
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.550
- What are you doin'
- Shut up!

01:34:25.050 --> 01:34:27.590
- What are you doin'
- Shut the fuck up!

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:31.140
- Hold it!
- Please...

01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:33.970
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

01:34:36.690 --> 01:34:38.480
I said hold it!

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:42.480
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:45.610
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.490
See? Or else he dies.

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:53.740
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.380
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:06.130
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:10.760
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:13.470
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.560
- One!
- Will you stop it!

01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:29.110
Take him.

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:33.240
Two.

01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:02.100
The two coded entries
in this ledger

01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:06.940
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

01:36:07.150 --> 01:36:12.820
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.620
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.500
I said that is correct.

01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:26.550
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

01:36:28.710 --> 01:36:30.840
I will.

01:36:31.050 --> 01:36:33.390
Sorry, Mr Payne, I can't hear you.

01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:36.390
I said, I will.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.310
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr Capone?

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:42.850
Yes, I was.

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:46.110
And you personally
distributed monies...

01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:50.360
..vast, undeclared monies...

01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:53.910
..to Mr Capone?

01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:56.490
Yes, I did.

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:59.540
Would you tell us the amounts?

01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:07.090
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr Capone

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:12.220
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

01:37:15.010 --> 01:37:17.890
Would you repeat that amount, please?

01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:24.730
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.370
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:47.750
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:14.110
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:19.740
Get me the bailiff.

01:38:21.370 --> 01:38:22.740
It'll be a fast trial.

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:30.960
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:36.090
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

01:38:42.970 --> 01:38:46.020
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:19.180
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.970
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.810
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:35.730
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.570
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:43.030
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:47.120
"Mr Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:49.750
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:53.420
I'm sorry, Mr Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:57.590
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.970
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:36.420
1634 Racine... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.190
Don't . Let him go.

01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:00.030
- No!
- Here, take it.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:15.700
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:19.410
What are you waitin' for?

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:23.500
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.960
Don't push me.

01:45:32.630 --> 01:45:35.340
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:38.680
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

01:45:38.890 --> 01:45:41.060
'Cause you killed my friend!

01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:44.900
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:48.730
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:52.440
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:08.630
Did he sound anything like that?

01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:41.950
One picture, come on, one picture.

01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:47.250
Mr Ness, take a look at this.

01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:50.590
Mr Ness?

01:46:52.210 --> 01:46:56.680
Mr Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.640
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr Ness.

01:47:00.850 --> 01:47:02.640
They've been bribed.

01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:06.940
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.610
He's in the car.

01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:33.500
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow...

01:47:33.710 --> 01:47:39.430
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:44.510
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.810
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:53.650
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must...

01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:57.280
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr Ness.

01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:09.870
Would you excuse us?

01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:13.900
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

01:49:18.570 --> 01:49:21.360
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

01:49:21.570 --> 01:49:24.700
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:30.160
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:35.630
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

01:49:36.710 --> 01:49:38.250
What's he talking about?

01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:44.590
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.140
Your Honour, I object!

01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:49.310
Overruled.

01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:55.100
What did you tell him?

01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:00.150
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:04.280
His name wasn't in the ledger!

01:50:04.490 --> 01:50:07.530
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.240
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

01:50:09.450 --> 01:50:12.790
- I think...
- Do somethin' here.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.580
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'

01:50:16.170 --> 01:50:18.170
Order!

01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:23.510
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.680
and enter a plea of Guilty.

01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.060
- GuiltÃ½?
- Order in the court!

01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:34.310
Order!

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:46.110
Bailiff! Bailiff!

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.780
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.620
Eliot!

01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:55.000
Your Honour!
Is that justice?

01:50:55.210 --> 01:50:57.920
Please, why did he switch the jury?

01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.670
Are you gonna go
after the organisation?

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.340
Excuse me.

01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:06.930
I'm askin' Your Honour,
is this justice?

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:14.020
Is this justice?

01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:20.060
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:21.770
What did you say?

01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:25.110
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.360
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

01:51:27.570 --> 01:51:30.120
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:33.120
Here endeth the lesson.

01:51:33.330 --> 01:51:37.580
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:41.000
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.290
So much violence.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.900
Cleaning up a little.

01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:21.580
I guess this is goodbye.

01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:24.500
Goodbye, George.

01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:30.210
I want to...thank you for this.

01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:33.090
No. Thank you.

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.610
Mr Ness... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.910
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:03.120
I'm going home.

01:55:14.050 --> 01:55:16.680
Mr Ness!
Any comment for the record?

01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.590
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:22.350
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:25.560
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

01:55:25.770 --> 01:55:28.850
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.
