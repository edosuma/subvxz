00:09.826 --> 00:12.209
Previously on 24.

00:12.771 --> 00:17.262
We release the Sentox here
and 200,000 people die.

00:17.353 --> 00:19.308
We need access to
the control room.

00:19.635 --> 00:22.546
Jack, Bierko will be ready
to deploy any minute.

00:28.688 --> 00:31.229
If we could ignite that gas
before it leaves the plant,

00:31.259 --> 00:33.022
the Sentox will be incinerated.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.346
Bierko!

00:42.410 --> 00:43.722
Give me a hand.

00:44.423 --> 00:47.479
Organize an escort team.
You get him back to CTU alive.

00:47.710 --> 00:48.304
You got it.

00:48.442 --> 00:53.170
I just word from the FAA about a
hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight.

00:53.269 --> 00:55.556
- So, what?
- Jack Bauer is the hijacker.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.673
What was he doing
on that flight?

00:57.732 --> 01:01.556
Looking for the recording that
implicates me in David Palmer's death.

01:01.674 --> 01:06.052
Order the plane down and grab
Bauer before he can hurt us.

01:06.190 --> 01:09.293
We need to take him down now,
dead or alive.

01:09.857 --> 01:10.850
Mr. President?

01:10.990 --> 01:13.054
I don't care if Bauer's
making threats or not,

01:13.084 --> 01:15.084
that plane has to
land immediately.

01:15.318 --> 01:16.409
And when it lands,

01:16.557 --> 01:19.089
I want my secret service detail
to take him into custody.

01:19.119 --> 01:20.977
- Sit down!
- He has a gun!

01:21.070 --> 01:22.784
Everybody just stay
in your seats!

01:22.876 --> 01:24.938
Do what I tell you and
no one will get hurt!

01:24.968 --> 01:27.065
Captain, this I Jack Bauer.

01:27.204 --> 01:28.837
I'm speaking to you on
a discreet channel.

01:28.867 --> 01:29.971
The person that
I'm looking for,

01:30.001 --> 01:32.543
the man with the evidence that I need,
is sitting next to you.

01:32.573 --> 01:36.346
He's your copilot, Scott Evans.
You need to open the door.

01:40.239 --> 01:43.865
Could you, uh,
take the stick for a second?

01:47.881 --> 01:50.310
I'm the only one who
can fly this plane now!

01:51.855 --> 01:53.425
Give me the recording.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.891
Advise CTU I have
the recording.

01:59.033 --> 02:01.048
I'll be on the ground in
less than 15 minutes.

02:01.078 --> 02:03.878
Bauer's got the evidence.
He is in control of the plane.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.170
What do we do?

02:05.310 --> 02:07.995
You are going to have to shoot
down that plane, Mr. President.

02:08.025 --> 02:13.045
Otherwise, you'll go to prison
for treason and murder.

Sierra Tango, cleared to flight
level 2-2-0, report reaching.

02:29.556 --> 02:33.329
5-2-0, Sierra Tango descend
to flight level 2-2-0.

02:33.609 --> 02:35.655
We can expect the
approach to Van Nuys.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.363
Good.

02:36.548 --> 02:40.035
This is Jack Bauer.
Can you patch me through to Karen Hayes?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.530
I'm bleeding.
I think you broke my nose.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.622
You'll get medical attention as
soon as we're on the ground.

02:45.652 --> 02:48.514
Right now, your only concern
should be flying this plane.

02:50.717 --> 02:52.731
Miss Hayes,
I've got Jack Bauer on line one.

02:52.761 --> 02:55.127
- Put him through.
- Yes, Jack?

02:55.219 --> 02:56.899
I've got the recording.
It was on the copilot.

02:56.929 --> 02:58.996
- The copilot?
- Yeah, he was working for Henderson.

02:59.026 --> 03:01.226
The captain's unconscious,
but I've secured the copilot.

03:01.256 --> 03:04.106
We're en route back to Van
Nuys airfield. What's our ETA?

03:04.256 --> 03:05.636
21 minutes.

03:05.916 --> 03:08.554
We're going to be on the ground in
21 minutes. Karen, listen to me.

03:08.584 --> 03:10.934
This recording proves that
President Logan was complicit

03:10.964 --> 03:13.268
in David Palmer's assassination.
It's imperative that

03:13.298 --> 03:16.794
we do not let it fall into the hands of
anyone that is loyal to the president.

03:16.824 --> 03:18.374
As soon as we're on the ground,

03:18.438 --> 03:21.747
I'm going to need you to provide me
with a safe corridor back to CTU.

03:21.777 --> 03:22.819
Jack, it's Bill.

03:23.006 --> 03:24.973
I'm back here with Karen.
I'll explain everything later.

03:25.003 --> 03:27.209
We can dispatch a team to
meet you at the airfield.

03:27.239 --> 03:29.808
They can head off any law enforcement,
take you into protective custody.

03:29.838 --> 03:33.160
Okay, good.
Bill, how is Audrey?

03:33.346 --> 03:34.595
Curtis just brought her in.

03:34.625 --> 03:37.497
She's in Medical getting treated, but
it looks like she's going to be okay.

03:37.527 --> 03:38.857
Thank God.

03:39.794 --> 03:42.862
Okay, I'll get back to you as
soon as we're on final approach.

03:42.892 --> 03:43.392
All right.

03:51.335 --> 03:52.041
Audrey.

03:52.510 --> 03:55.530
I just got off the phone with County
General. I have some great news.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.254
Your father survived the crash.

03:58.894 --> 03:59.889
He's alive?

04:00.169 --> 04:04.133
Yeah, one of our teams picked him up
about 30 minutes ago at the
accident site.

04:04.459 --> 04:07.609
He's still in ICU,
but they expect him to pull through.

04:07.749 --> 04:09.176
Oh, my God.

04:09.925 --> 04:13.225
We have a team stationed at the
hospital. He'll be well-protected.

04:14.664 --> 04:15.611
Thank you.

04:17.438 --> 04:19.248
I have to take this.

04:21.168 --> 04:22.931
Curtis?

04:23.118 --> 04:25.530
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

04:26.185 --> 04:28.152
- This is Manning.
- Is Henderson secured?

04:28.182 --> 04:29.430
He's in Holding Room Three.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.718
Good. I need you to take
a team to pick up Jack.

04:31.748 --> 04:32.504
Where is he?

04:32.639 --> 04:34.797
He's on a plane heading
towards the Van Nuys airport.

04:34.827 --> 04:36.977
- ETA is 20 minutes.
- Why is he on a plane?

04:37.199 --> 04:41.594
He had to commandeer the plane in order
to secure the evidence against
President Logan.

04:41.687 --> 04:43.371
I'll brief you with
the details en route.

04:43.401 --> 04:45.501
Curtis, I cannot
emphasize strongly enough

04:45.627 --> 04:48.577
the explosive nature of the
evidence that Jack is carrying.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.596
I need you to put him
into protective custody

04:50.626 --> 04:52.771
and bring him back here to CTU.

04:52.867 --> 04:53.715
Understood.

04:53.808 --> 04:56.494
President Logan will probably
send his men to retrieve it.

04:56.524 --> 04:58.142
You've got to get
to Jack first.

04:58.235 --> 04:59.663
We will. I'm heading out.

05:05.714 --> 05:06.189
Yes?

05:06.319 --> 05:09.486
We have a solution that will allow
you to order the plane shot down.

05:09.516 --> 05:11.365
I sure as hell hope so.
I may be the president,

05:11.395 --> 05:14.311
but there are protocols in
place that I can't just ignore.

05:14.399 --> 05:16.999
What we're proposing will
circumvent your protocols.

05:17.097 --> 05:17.805
What is it?

05:17.898 --> 05:20.198
We're going to simulate
a VCI distress signal.

05:20.511 --> 05:23.211
It'll be broadcast on the
airplane's transponder code,

05:23.369 --> 05:25.382
and it will appear to
come from Bauer's flight.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.989
Hold on.
What is a VCI distress signal?

05:28.129 --> 05:30.810
It's an emergency signal indicating
that there's a hijacking in progress,

05:30.840 --> 05:34.048
and that the perpetrators intend
to use the aircraft as a weapon.

05:34.078 --> 05:35.961
It'll give you the
pretext to shoot it down.

05:35.991 --> 05:39.793
There really is no other legitimate
response to this scenario,
Mr. President.

05:39.823 --> 05:42.489
All you need to do is appear
to struggle with the ethics

05:42.519 --> 05:45.007
and then give the order.

05:48.045 --> 05:49.662
- Mr. President?
- Fine.

05:51.211 --> 05:52.729
All right.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.602
You sound reluctant.

05:58.751 --> 06:00.599
I can't believe
it's come to this.

06:01.722 --> 06:04.522
I'm going to shoot down a
plane full of innocent people.

06:05.427 --> 06:09.308
None of us is happy about this, Mr.
President, but you don't really have
a choice.

06:09.338 --> 06:12.085
Bauer has evidence implicating
you in this conspiracy,

06:12.649 --> 06:16.249
and I don't have to tell you what the
consequences will be for all of us

06:16.368 --> 06:17.459
if it's released.

06:25.288 --> 06:27.338
We should contact
Chloe and bring her in.

06:27.756 --> 06:30.506
We're going to want her help
bringing Jack back to CTU.

06:30.519 --> 06:32.808
- Fine.
- Send an escort.

06:32.947 --> 06:35.531
Karen, I appreciate this.

06:35.802 --> 06:38.356
I know you're putting everything
on the line to help us.

06:38.386 --> 06:41.598
All I can say is this recording better
be everything Jack claims it is.

06:41.628 --> 06:42.700
I know Jack.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.040
I don't always agree with his methods,
but I trust his judgment.

06:48.138 --> 06:50.284
I'll go make that call.

06:51.594 --> 06:53.718
What's going on?
What's Buchanan doing out of Holding?

06:53.748 --> 06:56.469
The situation has changed, Miles.
There's some new intel.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.035
I haven't seen anything.
What new intel?

06:58.065 --> 06:59.553
I don't have time to
explain it right now.

06:59.583 --> 07:00.583
What does that mean?

07:00.650 --> 07:02.407
It means that I'll brief you
when I've got the chance.

07:02.437 --> 07:04.987
Have you compiled the orders
for Bierko's transfer?

07:05.007 --> 07:08.157
- I'm still working on them.
- Let me know when you've got them.

07:15.323 --> 07:16.607
What is it, Mike?

07:16.990 --> 07:19.794
A situation has come up
regarding the hijacked plane.

07:20.824 --> 07:22.206
Tell me what's happening.

07:22.344 --> 07:25.493
The FAA just picked up
a VCI distress code.

07:25.972 --> 07:29.110
It originated from
flight ST-520.

07:29.299 --> 07:31.016
What's a VCI distress code?

07:31.153 --> 07:34.933
The VCI is a coding system that was
recently installed on all
commercial airliners.

07:34.967 --> 07:38.118
This particular code indicates
that a hijacking is underway,

07:38.304 --> 07:42.413
and that the plane is going to be used
to target installations on the ground.

07:43.067 --> 07:44.015
Oh, my God.

07:44.202 --> 07:48.405
Admiral Kirkland is standing by on
video-conference from Point Mugu.

07:48.592 --> 07:50.878
He's ready to brief
you with the details.

07:56.926 --> 08:00.463
Admiral Kirkland, I'm Mike Novick.
I have the President here.

08:00.554 --> 08:01.500
Mr. President.

08:01.639 --> 08:04.992
Admiral. Mike's told me
about this VCI signal.

08:05.078 --> 08:07.330
How could it have been sent
without Bauer's knowledge?

08:07.360 --> 08:11.427
Most likely, one of the pilots under
duress secretly activated the
transponder code.

08:11.457 --> 08:12.609
Let me get this straight.

08:12.639 --> 08:15.264
At last report,
Bauer was in the passenger cabin.

08:15.357 --> 08:18.473
Does this mean that he's now in the
cockpit and that he's in control of
the plane?

08:18.503 --> 08:20.024
It appears that way, sir.

08:21.946 --> 08:23.688
What do we do, Admiral?

08:23.875 --> 08:26.978
Sir, the protocols for this
scenario are clearly specified.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.738
We're compelled to take
preemptive action.

08:29.908 --> 08:32.585
- What action?
- The aircraft must be shot down.

08:32.808 --> 08:35.337
We've already scrambled an
F-18 out of Point Mugu.

08:35.477 --> 08:37.432
We just need your
approval to engage.

08:41.697 --> 08:44.464
There are over 50 people
on that plane, Admiral.

08:44.604 --> 08:46.714
We have to think of the people
on the ground, Mr. President.

08:46.744 --> 08:49.465
Over 20 million citizens
live in Los Angeles County,

08:49.651 --> 08:52.082
each one of them is
now a potential target.

08:52.737 --> 08:53.972
I don't believe this.

08:54.112 --> 08:55.812
Mr. President,
if I can interject.

08:55.831 --> 08:59.143
Admiral, it's hard for me to
accept that Bauer intends

08:59.282 --> 09:02.771
to use the aircraft as a
weapon against civilians.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.209
From my briefing document,

09:04.358 --> 09:07.811
Jack Bauer is a distraught individual
with a history of erratic behavior.

09:07.841 --> 09:11.660
Jack Bauer has spent his entire
career protecting American lives.

09:11.847 --> 09:14.294
I think there's a reason
he's doing what he's doing.

09:14.324 --> 09:16.229
What would that be?

09:16.648 --> 09:19.766
I don't have the answer,
but we should at least try to find out.

09:19.796 --> 09:21.393
We don't have the time.

09:21.534 --> 09:25.335
Mr. President, we could have
the F-18 shadow the aircraft.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.812
We could issue a
standing order to fire

09:27.966 --> 09:30.671
only if the target deviates
from its present course.

09:30.775 --> 09:32.779
That's not a viable option,
Mr. President.

09:32.809 --> 09:33.518
Why not?

09:33.710 --> 09:35.431
Right now,
that plane is over the desert.

09:35.461 --> 09:37.621
In another 15 minutes,
it'll be above Los Angeles.

09:37.651 --> 09:39.287
If we're forced to
shoot it down then,

09:39.317 --> 09:41.185
there'll be facing massive
casualties on the ground.

09:41.215 --> 09:43.617
And, Mr. President,
we must also consider the possibility

09:43.647 --> 09:46.520
that Bauer intends to attack
the Presidential Retreat.

09:47.021 --> 09:47.976
The Retreat?

09:48.250 --> 09:49.750
You're inside the target zone,

09:49.864 --> 09:52.548
and Bauer's already been accused
of killing one president today.

09:52.578 --> 09:55.926
The simple fact is, sir,
we don't know what his intentions are.

09:56.069 --> 09:58.108
- Mr. President...
- Mike. Stop.

09:58.906 --> 10:01.290
I've made my decision.

10:02.748 --> 10:05.604
Admiral, I'm authorizing you
to shoot down that plane.

10:05.802 --> 10:06.421
Yes, sir.

10:06.824 --> 10:08.728
- Mr. President...
- Mike, please.

10:10.606 --> 10:14.137
Don't make this any more difficult
for me than it already is.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.832
Miss Hayes. This just came in
over the interagency sub-net.

10:26.956 --> 10:28.495
What is it?

10:31.485 --> 10:33.297
We have to alert Jack.

10:43.516 --> 10:44.373
This is Bauer.

10:44.507 --> 10:48.760
Jack, air traffic control just received
a VCI distress signal from
your aircraft.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.296
That effectively authorizes
President Logan to shoot you down.

10:52.475 --> 10:53.375
Shoot us down?

10:53.514 --> 10:55.482
And F-18's been scrambled
out of Point Mugu, Jack.

10:55.512 --> 10:57.658
You have eight to
ten minutes at best.

10:57.772 --> 10:59.773
Can you patch me through
to the pilot of the F-18?

10:59.803 --> 11:02.339
No chance.
They're on a coded frequency.

11:02.468 --> 11:04.238
We can try to get in touch
with the White House.

11:04.268 --> 11:05.263
And tell them what?

11:05.450 --> 11:07.526
They don't want to hear
anything I have to say.

11:07.556 --> 11:10.211
Hold on.
We need to land this plane now.

11:10.352 --> 11:12.013
We're 100 miles from
the nearest airport.

11:12.043 --> 11:14.154
They just scrambled an F-18
to shoot us out of the sky.

11:14.184 --> 11:15.670
We need to get on
the ground now!

11:15.700 --> 11:17.900
You didn't hear me.
There's nowhere to land.

11:18.777 --> 11:20.252
How much runway do you need?

11:20.392 --> 11:22.251
At least 5,000 feet.

11:22.389 --> 11:24.189
- Bill, do you hear me?
- Yeah, Jack.

11:24.272 --> 11:27.196
I need you to look for a stretch
of freeway 5,000 feet long,

11:27.226 --> 11:28.926
straight enough
for us to land on.

11:28.984 --> 11:31.493
I'll pull up maps in the area, Jack.
It'll take a few seconds.

11:31.523 --> 11:33.873
Get back to me as soon
as you've got something.

11:33.933 --> 11:35.383
We can't land on the freeway.

11:35.451 --> 11:36.447
Yes, we can.

11:36.587 --> 11:39.987
It's late, there's a curfew.
There won't be any cars on the freeway.

11:40.638 --> 11:43.723
Cuff your right hand to
the flight control, now.

11:49.660 --> 11:50.901
All the way.

11:53.353 --> 11:54.996
Start taking us down.

11:59.405 --> 12:00.687
Do it now.

12:17.891 --> 12:19.588
What's Chloe
O'Brian doing here?

12:19.727 --> 12:20.931
I don't know.

12:22.879 --> 12:24.307
You can go.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.377
What's going on?

12:26.478 --> 12:28.823
An F-18's been scrambled to
shoot down Jack's plane.

12:28.853 --> 12:31.535
Can you open up a socket with
the ATC radar tracking plot?

12:31.565 --> 12:33.041
Yeah, I think so.

12:33.178 --> 12:33.933
Do it, Chloe.

12:34.027 --> 12:37.429
We need to know the exact amount of time
Jack has before the fighter plane
reaches him.

12:37.459 --> 12:37.804
Okay.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.363
Karen, look at this.
Two possible landing sites.

12:40.597 --> 12:41.908
I think this one's
the best shot.

12:41.938 --> 12:43.788
I agree.
Let's get Jack on the phone.

12:48.655 --> 12:50.668
I need to speak with you.

12:52.390 --> 12:54.306
We need to make an
emergency landing.

12:54.389 --> 12:56.453
Talk to your passengers
and get them ready.

12:56.483 --> 12:57.333
What's happening?

12:57.378 --> 12:59.584
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.
Just get them ready.

12:59.614 --> 13:00.101
Okay.

13:02.196 --> 13:06.974
Listen up, everybody. We're going to
prepare for an emergency landing.

13:08.238 --> 13:08.999
It's Bauer.

13:09.146 --> 13:10.866
Jack, it's Bill,
I think we found something.

13:10.896 --> 13:13.746
Bill, hold on one sec.
I want to put you on speakerphone.

13:15.067 --> 13:15.866
Go ahead.

13:16.009 --> 13:19.932
It's a stretch of the 118 freeway
between mile marker 91 and 92.

13:20.018 --> 13:22.511
There's about 4,000 feet,
then there's an overpass.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.749
- That's not long enough.
- It's the best we can do.

13:24.779 --> 13:27.132
Copy that, Bill.
Hold on, give me a second.

13:27.582 --> 13:30.895
You can either try and land this
plane on the freeway or I will.

13:34.486 --> 13:36.006
Give me the coordinates.

13:37.301 --> 13:43.803
3-4-5-0.2 North by
1-1-0-3-0.4 West.

13:44.036 --> 13:45.897
We need to know
where that F-18 is.

13:46.127 --> 13:48.032
Jack, it's Chloe.
I'm working on it.

13:48.650 --> 13:49.495
Manning.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.836
We have the exact location
where Jack's putting down.

13:51.866 --> 13:52.623
Go ahead.

13:52.869 --> 13:55.767
It's the 118 freeway between
mile markers 91 and 92.

13:55.908 --> 13:57.540
He should be on the
ground within minutes.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.997
Copy. We're redirecting.

13:59.108 --> 14:00.680
- 118 freeway.
- Copy.

14:03.813 --> 14:05.763
Mr. President,
we're five minutes away.

14:05.823 --> 14:08.055
I'm patching us in directly
with the pilot of the F-18.

14:08.085 --> 14:08.654
Go ahead.

14:09.633 --> 14:13.483
Bravo One, this is Admiral Kirkland.
You're on with the president and myself.

14:13.559 --> 14:16.937
My radar is locked
onto the target.

14:24.063 --> 14:25.923
Okay, I've got the
ATC radar plot.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.582
Put it on the main screen.

14:28.613 --> 14:30.710
Jack, the F-18 is
within 15 miles.

14:32.068 --> 14:34.805
They're not gonna make it. He's gonna be
within the missile range in
two minutes.

14:34.835 --> 14:36.319
You're not descending
fast enough.

14:36.349 --> 14:38.797
If we increase the descent rate, we
won't be able to pull out of the dive.

14:38.827 --> 14:41.189
If we don't get on the ground
before that F-18 reaches us,

14:41.219 --> 14:43.446
it's not gonna matter.
Descend now!

14:53.074 --> 14:55.880
Put the oxygen masks on!

14:58.317 --> 15:00.935
Target has increased
angle and rate of descent.

15:01.497 --> 15:02.976
One minute from missile lock.

15:03.785 --> 15:06.156
Jack, they're almost
within weapons range.

15:06.584 --> 15:08.335
The aircraft can't take this.

15:08.504 --> 15:10.936
- I have to pull up.
- Not yet!

15:25.616 --> 15:27.098
I can see the freeway!

15:29.298 --> 15:30.241
Come on.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.366
Okay, level up now! Now!

15:37.928 --> 15:40.102
We can't pull out of the dive!

15:41.911 --> 15:44.430
I need your help! Pull!

15:47.290 --> 15:49.308
Ground proximity alert.

15:52.292 --> 15:53.718
20 seconds to missile lock.

15:53.858 --> 15:56.577
Target's at 1,000
feet and leveling.

15:56.719 --> 15:59.150
- Leveling?
- Affirmative, sir.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.801
- What does that mean?
- Target may be preparing to land.

16:03.027 --> 16:05.799
The objective seems to
be the 118 freeway.

16:10.608 --> 16:12.081
Lower the landing gear!

16:12.223 --> 16:14.039
- We're going too fast!
- Lower it!

16:18.955 --> 16:21.207
He's lowering his landing gear.

16:21.966 --> 16:24.042
The F-18's in range.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.704
I have missile lock.

16:28.902 --> 16:30.762
The aircraft is in a
landing profile, sir.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.748
- I recommend we abort.
- What?

16:32.872 --> 16:34.148
The parameters
have changed, sir.

16:34.178 --> 16:35.578
I want that plane shot down!

16:35.639 --> 16:37.928
- Sir...
- Order your man to fire, now!

16:38.209 --> 16:40.797
Mr. President!
Admiral Kirkland is right.

16:41.179 --> 16:44.515
The aircraft's not a threat.
There's no reason to do this.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.012
I implore you to reconsider.

16:50.122 --> 16:52.744
Sir, we have a lock.
What are your orders?

16:56.263 --> 16:57.975
- Abort.
- Yes, sir.

16:58.068 --> 16:59.218
But if they don't land,

16:59.346 --> 17:01.650
I want you to shoot that
plane down immediately!

17:01.680 --> 17:05.932
Yes, Mr. President. Bravo One,
hold fire. I repeat, hold fire.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.075
Copy, base.
Bravo One holding fire.

17:08.167 --> 17:09.969
We have Marine units
deployed in the area.

17:09.999 --> 17:13.334
I want them to cordon off the landing
site and apprehend Jack Bauer.

17:13.364 --> 17:13.901
Yes, sir.

17:18.628 --> 17:19.868
500 feet!

17:20.596 --> 17:21.984
We're not gonna make it.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.758
Come on.

17:30.405 --> 17:31.818
CTU.

17:32.045 --> 17:34.895
We've spotted the plane.
They're coming in for a landing.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.504
We're heading towards them now.

17:37.130 --> 17:39.084
I'm handing the
controls back to you!

17:39.879 --> 17:41.068
Touch it down!

17:41.271 --> 17:43.877
- We're still going too fast!
- Touch it down!

17:53.680 --> 17:55.180
Target has touched down.

17:55.339 --> 17:57.102
I'm clear. Returning to base.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.631
Bill, we made it.
We're down on the ground.

18:24.661 --> 18:27.011
Jack, we've redirected
Curtis to your location.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.189
He should be there
in a few minutes.

18:28.219 --> 18:31.269
I'm just east of the Balboa overpass.
Have him meet me there.

18:31.397 --> 18:34.032
Send a secondary team
to pick up the copilot.

18:35.004 --> 18:37.196
Got it. Get out of there, Jack!

18:44.115 --> 18:46.715
Everyone, keep moving to
the rear of the plane!

18:46.855 --> 18:49.243
Exit from the rear, now!

19:15.076 --> 19:16.709
You should have followed through,
Mr. President.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.627
You should have ordered
that pilot to fire.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.520
They were landing on a freeway.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.941
I had no pretext to shoot them down.
I had to abort.

19:24.053 --> 19:26.692
It's going to be much harder to
contain now, if not impossible.

19:26.722 --> 19:27.822
Bauer's on the ground.

19:28.025 --> 19:31.371
He won't get far.
Even before the plane touched down,

19:31.600 --> 19:34.100
I ordered two battalions
of Marines into the area.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.673
They're cordoning off the landing site,
even as we speak.

19:36.703 --> 19:37.674
Bauer...

19:38.816 --> 19:40.483
has nowhere to run.

19:41.093 --> 19:44.093
I hope you're right, Mr. President.
This is our last chance.

19:44.110 --> 19:45.860
- If Bauer gets through...
- I know.

19:47.070 --> 19:49.365
I know what's at stake, Graham.

19:52.313 --> 19:54.794
I'll get back to you as
soon as I have any news.

20:14.563 --> 20:16.464
- Yeah.
- Curtis, it's Jack!

20:16.583 --> 20:18.453
- Go ahead.
- The Marines are moving in.

20:18.483 --> 20:20.211
They're setting up a perimeter.
Where are you?

20:20.241 --> 20:22.348
We're approaching your
position from the north.

20:22.378 --> 20:28.451
Okay, I got you. I'll meet you on
the north side of the freeway.

20:50.638 --> 20:53.588
They know I'm still in the area.
We got to get out of here.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.235
Head south on Variel. Move.

21:05.273 --> 21:06.118
Damn it.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.258
You're gonna have to try and talk
your way through the roadblock.

21:09.288 --> 21:10.635
Get your hands up!

21:15.267 --> 21:16.698
Hands where we can see them.

21:16.847 --> 21:20.657
We're federal agents.
Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit.

21:21.546 --> 21:24.664
We've been given orders to detain
everybody inside this perimeter.

21:24.694 --> 21:26.278
We're all on the same
team here, Commander.

21:26.308 --> 21:28.642
We're trying to apprehend the
suspect who hijacked that plane.

21:28.672 --> 21:29.902
- Jack Bauer?
- That's right.

21:29.932 --> 21:31.203
Now, let us do our job.

21:31.602 --> 21:34.509
I need to see individual ID's.
I'm gonna call this in.

21:34.676 --> 21:36.086
We don't have time
for this, Commander.

21:36.116 --> 21:38.831
The longer we sit here, the better
chance Bauer has of slipping through
the net.

21:38.861 --> 21:40.311
This will only take
a few minutes.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.314
A few minutes is all
Bauer needs to escape.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.202
We're not prepared
to let that happen.

21:44.232 --> 21:45.369
Now we're moving out.

21:45.510 --> 21:48.660
If you really want to fire on
federal agents, that's your call.

21:52.668 --> 21:53.973
Stand down.

21:54.697 --> 21:55.816
Move out.

21:57.736 --> 21:58.837
Stand down!

22:08.899 --> 22:10.988
Head east for a while,
then turn south.

22:11.204 --> 22:11.897
Yes, sir.

22:13.007 --> 22:13.736
Buchanan.

22:13.911 --> 22:16.109
It's Curtis. We've got Jack,
and we're headed back in.

22:16.139 --> 22:16.968
Okay, Curtis.

22:17.288 --> 22:20.240
Marines are all over the place.
Barely got past one of the patrols.

22:20.270 --> 22:22.191
They must be taking
direct orders from Logan.

22:22.221 --> 22:23.476
There's no other explanation.

22:23.506 --> 22:25.421
We can't take the chance of running
into any more of these patrols.

22:25.451 --> 22:26.986
We'll stick to
the back streets.

22:27.016 --> 22:27.823
Understood.

22:30.942 --> 22:31.798
Hayes.

22:31.879 --> 22:33.429
I want to know what's going on.

22:34.132 --> 22:37.152
Miles, I told you I would tell you
when I felt the time was right.

22:37.182 --> 22:39.992
I'm sitting here watching you
work with two people under arrest

22:40.022 --> 22:42.172
for aiding and abetting
a federal fugitive.

22:42.372 --> 22:46.359
If you don't talk to me, I'll have
to get my answers somewhere else.

22:47.008 --> 22:48.514
I'll be right there.

22:50.022 --> 22:52.214
You can't tell him.

22:52.375 --> 22:53.975
I can't hold him
off any longer.

22:54.109 --> 22:55.909
You really think
that's a good idea?

22:57.017 --> 23:00.487
I have to trust him.
He's been nothing but loyal.

23:01.145 --> 23:03.995
I probably shouldn't have kept
him in the dark this long.

23:04.617 --> 23:06.121
I'll be right back.

23:20.925 --> 23:22.826
I don't appreciate
being threatened, Miles.

23:22.856 --> 23:24.756
And I don't appreciate
being shut out.

23:26.996 --> 23:29.196
We've worked a lot of
years together, Karen,

23:29.297 --> 23:31.632
and I have never wavered
in my allegiance.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.105
I don't deserve this.

23:36.526 --> 23:38.450
No, you don't.

23:41.363 --> 23:42.618
Come with me.

24:00.090 --> 24:04.503
Jack Bauer's acquired evidence
implicating President Logan in David
Palmer's death.

24:05.470 --> 24:06.870
Have you seen this evidence?

24:06.940 --> 24:08.790
No, but Bauer's
bringing it here now.

24:08.899 --> 24:09.625
What is it?

24:09.871 --> 24:13.312
It's a recording of a conversation
between the president and an accomplice.

24:13.342 --> 24:14.732
- But you haven't heard it?
- No.

24:14.762 --> 24:17.067
And that's what you're doing
with Buchanan and O'Brian?

24:17.097 --> 24:20.374
- Covertly helping Bauer?
- Yes.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.592
For the past three hours,
President Logan has done

24:23.663 --> 24:26.963
everything in his power to keep
Jack from getting back here alive.

24:27.002 --> 24:29.650
You're working against the most
powerful man in the world,

24:29.680 --> 24:31.880
and you haven't actually
heard the evidence.

24:32.001 --> 24:33.764
This is why I didn't
talk to you, Miles.

24:33.794 --> 24:35.277
Because you knew I'd
talk you out of it.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.913
Yes, I know what
I'm doing is risky.

24:36.943 --> 24:39.422
If I am wrong, my career is over.
I could be brought up on charges.

24:39.452 --> 24:40.786
Not just your career, Karen.

24:40.816 --> 24:43.635
I am doing this because I believe
that Bauer is telling the truth.

24:43.665 --> 24:45.200
But you don't know.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.191
Okay, okay.

24:47.376 --> 24:48.722
Let's say he is.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.064
Let's say that recording
implicates Logan.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.433
Then what are you going to do?

24:55.782 --> 24:58.732
Are you going to arrest the
President of the United States?

24:59.299 --> 25:01.299
That will be up to
the attorney general.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.388
- You're depending on...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.*

25:03.418 --> 25:05.268
- Yes.
- They're ready to move Bierko.

25:05.411 --> 25:07.059
Thank you. I'll be right out.

25:10.504 --> 25:14.186
Look, I have to go over
the transfer protocols.

25:14.370 --> 25:17.064
I know that what I'm asking
from you is difficult.

25:17.471 --> 25:21.058
Everything rests with
what's on that recording.

25:24.685 --> 25:26.339
Tell me what you need.

25:26.519 --> 25:28.019
Bauer will be here any minute.

25:28.148 --> 25:30.246
The best way for you to help
me is to go back out there

25:30.276 --> 25:32.103
and keep things
running smoothly.

25:32.273 --> 25:33.485
- All right.
- Miles?

25:34.304 --> 25:36.508
It's imperative this
stay between us.

25:36.684 --> 25:38.293
- Of course.
- Thank you.

26:03.065 --> 26:03.918
Thank you.

26:04.349 --> 26:05.865
We have a full
tactical complement,

26:05.895 --> 26:08.245
enhanced ordinance package,
two vehicle escort.

26:11.416 --> 26:13.616
Vladimir Bierko,
you're being transferred to

26:13.630 --> 26:16.493
a primary holding facility at
our district headquarters.

26:19.401 --> 26:21.395
Let me know the
second he arrives.

26:21.553 --> 26:23.410
Understood. Let's move out.

27:25.315 --> 27:27.781
- Where the hell is Mike Novick?
- He's on his way, sir.

27:27.811 --> 27:29.751
You told me that
three minutes ago.

27:29.842 --> 27:30.359
Yes, sir.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.401
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
I was on the phone with Colonel Owens.

27:38.431 --> 27:40.557
He's the Marine field
commander on the site.

27:40.587 --> 27:42.485
- Is Bauer in custody?
- No, sir.

27:42.931 --> 27:43.997
What happened?

27:44.235 --> 27:48.534
As ordered, the Marines sealed off a
one-mile radius around the landing site.

27:48.620 --> 27:50.520
They've completed a
sweep of the area.

27:50.522 --> 27:51.087
And?

27:52.060 --> 27:55.367
And it's Colonel
Owens' estimation that

27:55.461 --> 27:58.938
Bauer is no longer
inside the perimeter.

28:00.585 --> 28:02.927
- He got away.
- It appears so, sir.

28:06.426 --> 28:08.587
I can't believe this.

28:09.055 --> 28:13.587
Uh, Mr. President, it's only a matter
of time before Bauer's apprehended.

28:28.695 --> 28:30.315
Sir, are you all right?

28:45.776 --> 28:48.994
Thank you, Mike.
I need some time alone now.

29:44.635 --> 29:47.835
Jack, the attorney general's on
his way to his office right now.

29:47.849 --> 29:50.012
He'll be ready for a video
conference in ten minutes.

29:50.042 --> 29:53.721
Okay, good. Chloe, I want you to
prepare the recording for playback.

29:53.872 --> 29:56.346
I want you to clean it up
and apply a digital signature

29:56.376 --> 29:58.176
so that we can establish
a chain of evidence.

29:58.206 --> 30:00.037
Okay. You need to work alone.

30:00.120 --> 30:01.693
I don't want anyone else
near that recording.

30:01.723 --> 30:03.606
You don't ever let it
out of your sight.

30:03.636 --> 30:04.411
I won't.

30:04.577 --> 30:06.764
You said I had ten minutes.
I'd like to see Audrey.

30:06.794 --> 30:08.262
Of course. She's in Medical.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.185
Thank you.

30:15.134 --> 30:17.334
Well, when will I be
able to speak with him?

30:18.328 --> 30:20.070
All right, I understand.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.590
Well, just let him know...

30:27.714 --> 30:30.668
Can you please tell him that
his daughter called and that...

30:30.698 --> 30:32.562
she loves him very much.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.965
Thank you.

30:35.006 --> 30:37.351
It looks like my dad's
gonna be all right.

30:37.599 --> 30:39.183
Yeah, I know, I heard.

30:41.410 --> 30:44.060
Oh, God,
I'm so glad to see you.

30:44.623 --> 30:46.075
Me, too.

30:54.092 --> 30:55.232
We did it.

30:56.262 --> 31:00.063
We got the evidence.
The attorney general's going to hear it.

31:01.457 --> 31:03.269
- So it's over?
- Yeah.

31:05.671 --> 31:09.074
President Logan's going to pay
for David Palmer's assassination.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.384
Thank you.

31:20.254 --> 31:24.129
Close your eyes.
I'm going to sit with you for a minute.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.790
- Yes.
- Graham.

32:20.596 --> 32:21.944
I've been trying to reach you.

32:21.974 --> 32:22.652
I know.

32:23.430 --> 32:25.703
Bauer slipped through the cordon,
didn't he?

32:25.809 --> 32:26.505
Yes.

32:26.891 --> 32:30.615
I've just been told that the
attorney general's office

32:30.793 --> 32:33.765
received a phone call
from the director of CTU.

32:34.595 --> 32:38.287
I think it's fairly obvious they're
in possession of the recording.

32:38.381 --> 32:40.452
I think that phone
call was about you.

32:42.072 --> 32:44.504
I didn't expect it
would to happen so soon.

32:46.219 --> 32:49.874
I am sorry, Charles.
You don't deserve this.

32:50.064 --> 32:53.884
Listen, Graham,
despite how things turned out...

32:55.733 --> 32:58.062
...I still believe that
we were in the right.

32:58.165 --> 33:01.129
I still believe that we acted in
the best interest of the country.

33:01.159 --> 33:04.742
And we have to keep putting the
country's well-being ahead of our own.

33:04.842 --> 33:07.890
The spectacle of a sitting
president on trial for murder

33:08.390 --> 33:09.664
would be devastating.

33:10.023 --> 33:12.675
Yes. Yes, it would.

33:13.581 --> 33:16.258
Aside from the psychological
damage to the country,

33:16.347 --> 33:21.083
a trial would expose certain realities
that should never see the light of day.

33:22.861 --> 33:26.401
If only we could keep such
a trial from taking place.

33:28.271 --> 33:30.823
That thought occurred to me,
as well.

33:31.125 --> 33:32.648
I'm glad we agree.

33:34.272 --> 33:38.034
I want you to know I've taken steps to
ensure that you and your associates

33:38.156 --> 33:39.906
won't be implicated
in any of this.

33:40.572 --> 33:42.813
I appreciate that, Charles.

33:43.592 --> 33:45.098
We all do.

33:49.709 --> 33:51.263
There's nothing more to say.

33:52.897 --> 33:55.552
I'm going to hang up now.
There are, uh,

33:56.040 --> 33:59.043
a few things I'd like to
take care of before...

34:01.109 --> 34:02.662
Good-bye, Charles.

34:05.536 --> 34:07.140
Good-bye, Graham.

34:46.348 --> 34:48.226
Martha, may I come in?

34:50.536 --> 34:52.527
Now you want to talk?

34:52.737 --> 34:54.545
Marti, please?

34:56.356 --> 34:58.063
What do you want?

35:09.525 --> 35:11.923
Is there something else
you want to confess?

35:12.216 --> 35:14.211
No.

35:27.195 --> 35:29.729
I want to tell you
how sorry I am...

35:30.236 --> 35:31.874
for everything.

35:39.294 --> 35:43.115
When you forget to give me
something for my birthday,

35:43.913 --> 35:46.850
that's when you
say you're sorry.

35:47.978 --> 35:49.848
I know what I did was wrong.

35:50.022 --> 35:53.229
It was horribly wrong and unforgivable.
I know that.

35:55.425 --> 35:59.114
But what I can't live with
is the fact that I hurt you.

36:01.354 --> 36:03.983
That's the last
thing I wanted to do.

36:08.483 --> 36:12.377
Marti? Marti, please.

36:16.235 --> 36:17.774
That's the truth.

36:22.077 --> 36:23.382
The truth.

36:31.946 --> 36:34.743
You know what really
gets me, Charles?

36:35.063 --> 36:35.917
What?

36:36.475 --> 36:39.914
That you had me
going for so long.

36:40.811 --> 36:44.422
I had no idea you were
such a good liar.

36:45.885 --> 36:49.120
If I wasn't so horrified by the
fact that I'm married to you,

36:49.323 --> 36:51.812
I might actually be impressed.

39:08.492 --> 39:09.286
Yes.

39:09.572 --> 39:11.322
I have an urgent
call for you, sir.

39:11.347 --> 39:15.008
He says his name is
Miles Papazian from CTU.

39:15.397 --> 39:17.642
I don't want to talk
to anyone from CTU.

39:17.826 --> 39:22.919
He insists that you'll want to speak
to him. He says it's about Jack Bauer.

39:30.351 --> 39:31.544
Put him through.

39:31.728 --> 39:34.882
You're on with the President.

39:35.016 --> 39:38.570
- Mr. President?
- Yes, go ahead.

39:38.692 --> 39:42.637
You don't know me; my name is Miles
Papazian. I work under Karen Hayes.

39:43.889 --> 39:45.326
What is this about?

39:45.445 --> 39:47.572
It's about a recording, sir,

39:47.681 --> 39:50.835
that Jack Bauer has just
delivered here to CTU.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.792
Sir, my understanding is

39:53.997 --> 39:57.632
it's a recording of a conversation
of yours that, if leaked,

39:57.733 --> 40:01.083
could significantly
compromise national security.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.046
Go on.

40:04.338 --> 40:09.588
My superior, Ms. Hayes,
is working with Bauer and Bill Buchanan.

40:10.468 --> 40:14.204
Their intention is to play the
recording for the attorney general.

40:16.502 --> 40:18.027
Why are you telling me this?

40:18.212 --> 40:19.724
Because, sir...

40:20.482 --> 40:23.825
I feel compelled to intervene.

40:24.151 --> 40:29.329
And I just I wanted to make
sure that you would approve.

40:32.211 --> 40:35.620
I do, Mr.
Papazian, I do approve.

40:38.829 --> 40:42.270
Listen, I'm going
to text you...

40:43.259 --> 40:45.537
my private number.

40:46.545 --> 40:50.508
Let me know how it goes.
And, Miles...

40:51.964 --> 40:55.113
...I promise you,
I won't forget this.

40:55.394 --> 40:59.201
Thank you, sir.
That's all I wanted to hear.

40:59.416 --> 41:04.088
Mr. President, I look forward to
speaking with you again soon.

41:43.781 --> 41:46.881
Karen wants to know how long
before the teleconference starts?

41:46.912 --> 41:48.927
Five minutes--
get out of here, Miles.

41:50.324 --> 41:52.137
We'll be ready?

41:52.324 --> 41:53.620
Not if you keep
interrupting me.

41:53.650 --> 41:55.042
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.

41:55.072 --> 41:58.277
Well, if your job is to slow things
down, then you're doing really
good work.

41:58.307 --> 41:59.985
I'll tell Karen
you'll be ready.

42:00.207 --> 42:01.161
Thanks.
