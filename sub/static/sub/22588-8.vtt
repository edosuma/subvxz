00:26.091 --> 00:29.393
<i> Mr. Freeze strikes again.</i>

00:35.167 --> 00:38.301
<i> He's after big ice cubes.</i>

00:43.575 --> 00:46.576
<i> He cooled the guard.</i>

00:49.081 --> 00:52.816
<i> He gave everybody the slip.</i>

00:55.187 --> 00:59.523
<i> Will the real Batman</i>

01:01.727 --> 01:05.262
<i> Curses! Foiled again!</i>

01:07.566 --> 01:11.301

<i> A new clue.</i>

03:18.398 --> 03:20.831
Instant freezing.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.600
- Deadly!
- Oh!

03:22.602 --> 03:26.304
If I could only get me mitts on
that dastardly Mr. Freeze..

03:26.306 --> 03:29.507
Patience, O'Hara. No public
official elected by the people

03:29.509 --> 03:33.411
can allow his emotions to
overrule his dedication to duty.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.881
And carrying out
the due process of law.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.856
- Is there a chance?
- What do you want? Miracles?

03:45.858 --> 03:48.659
I'm doin' the best I can.
The best I can do.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.362
- And that's all I can do.
- Easy, now, Vince.

03:51.364 --> 03:53.631
This has been tough
on all of us.

03:53.633 --> 03:58.436
If I can just raise their body
temperature, gradually enough.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.605
There's an outside chance,
but it's tricky.

04:01.607 --> 04:05.676
One degree
too much...too soon.

04:12.118 --> 04:16.553
It'll be a long
and worrisome vigil, I fear.

04:16.555 --> 04:20.825
Two such magnificent
specimens of manhood.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.630
Why?

04:43.549 --> 04:46.751
- The saints be praised!
- Look!

05:02.167 --> 05:05.602
We interrupt our regular program
to repeat this earlier bulletin.

05:05.604 --> 05:09.773
Batman and Robin are alive.
Repeat, are alive.

05:09.775 --> 05:13.076
'After the almost fatal
and most mysterious attack'

05:13.078 --> 05:13.777
'on them last night.'

05:13.779 --> 05:17.614
The dynamic duo were instantly
frozen by an unknown assailant

05:17.616 --> 05:20.518
who robbed Princess Sandra
escaping with the famed

05:20.520 --> 05:21.986
Ghiaccio Circulo diamond.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.588
'The would-be killer
is still at large.'

05:24.590 --> 05:27.825
'And now, back to Gotham City
stadium for the ceremonies'

05:27.827 --> 05:30.728
'preceding today's game
between the Eagles'

05:30.730 --> 05:33.130
'and the Windy City Wildcats.'

05:33.132 --> 05:36.133
- Uh, Boss.
- Come in, Mole.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.003
I-I can't.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.671
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:44.777 --> 05:45.543
How did it go?

05:45.545 --> 05:47.478
Operation Big Diamond
accomplished.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.379
- Good.
- Where do you want it?

05:48.381 --> 05:50.081
In here where
I can see it.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.250
And tell airplane
to zoom-zoom-zoom.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.585
Right, boss.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.390
Ah, Batman,
you still live.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.259
But only for a short time.

06:01.261 --> 06:06.130
I now have the most precious
diamond of all in my possession.

06:06.132 --> 06:10.068
And to get it back,
you must die.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.069
Die! Die!

06:11.071 --> 06:14.572
'From Bruce Wayne's private box
in Gotham City's new stadium.'

06:15.674 --> 06:18.608
'Princess Sandra of Molino
is getting ready to toss out'

06:18.610 --> 06:21.445
'the first ball at this
great charity game between'

06:21.447 --> 06:25.248
'the two deadliest rivals
in any baseball league.'

06:25.250 --> 06:29.286
'It's a beautiful day.
A <i> b-eautiful</i> day.'

06:29.288 --> 06:32.957
'But no more beautiful than
the lovely princess herself.'

06:40.367 --> 06:41.299
May I?

06:41.801 --> 06:45.703
Well, I'm-I'm sure I can't pitch
like your great Paul Diamante

06:45.705 --> 06:49.473
but, why, I do
have a few curves.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.351
Play ball.

07:11.297 --> 07:13.564
Oh, I'm so excited.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.533
And part of it is
seeing you again.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.401
I'm just sorry
the circumstances

07:17.403 --> 07:19.370
couldn't have been
more favorable.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.740
Losing the Ghiaccio Circulo
diamond last night.

07:22.742 --> 07:23.374
Oh, that.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.344
Well, just be thankful that
my servant and those two simply

07:26.346 --> 07:29.413
magnificent creatures, Batman
and Robin are still alive.

07:29.415 --> 07:32.516
I'd give anything
to meet them someday.

07:32.518 --> 07:35.886
- Socially, of course.
- Perhaps you may..

07:35.888 --> 07:37.688
...someday.

07:43.996 --> 07:47.631
I'm dying to watch
Paul Diamante pitch.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.600
Is he really as
good as they say?

07:49.602 --> 07:52.403
Better! Like
real cool, ma'am..

07:52.405 --> 07:53.571
I mean, Your Royal Highness.

07:53.573 --> 07:57.007
'Attention,
your attention, please.'

07:57.009 --> 07:58.943
'Change in the line-up.'

07:58.945 --> 08:04.382
'Pitcher for the Gotham
City Eagles, number 77'

08:04.384 --> 08:08.886
'Denny Allen
for Paul Diamante.'

08:08.888 --> 08:12.623
'Apparently, Paul Diamante is..'

08:12.759 --> 08:16.694
'Well, we're not sure
what happened.'

08:17.897 --> 08:19.163
I don't understand.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.799
I'm beginning to.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.706
Diamante means
diamond in Spanish.

08:28.708 --> 08:29.440
Mr. Freeze.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.610
I thought Batman was out of
danger. What does this mean?

08:32.611 --> 08:34.477
Uh, if you'll excuse us,
princess. I'm sorry.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.547
I've forgotten that
we have a board meeting at

08:36.549 --> 08:39.183
the Bruce Wayne Foundation
scheduled for this afternoon.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.520
Can't miss a board meeting.

08:44.123 --> 08:47.158
Well, I never..

08:50.096 --> 08:53.631
Our only clue. According
to Diamante's landlady

08:53.633 --> 08:54.865
These three rather
disreputable men

08:54.867 --> 08:57.501
visited Diamante's apartment
this morning.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.537
When she up to clean
the apartment

08:59.539 --> 09:02.706
..no Diamante,
only this note.

09:03.943 --> 09:06.777
"You will soon
hear my terms."

09:06.779 --> 09:08.145
That's all?

09:08.147 --> 09:11.182
- And this.
- Mr. Freeze. Who else?

09:11.184 --> 09:13.551
Afraid you're right.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.656
Commissioner Gordon speaking.

09:26.766 --> 09:29.900
'Ah-ha-ha, commissioner.
You still there?'

09:29.902 --> 09:33.904
We're all here, listening.
Chief O'Hara, Batman, Robin.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.875
'Batman, perfect.
Absolutely perfect.'

09:37.877 --> 09:43.747
'You are there and I am here
with your most precious diamond'

09:43.749 --> 09:45.583
'from the baseball diamond.'

09:45.585 --> 09:49.787
'Clever, yeah?
Diamond from the diamond.'

09:49.789 --> 09:51.989
- 'Speak to them.'
- 'This is Paul Diamante.'

09:51.991 --> 09:54.992
'This kookie character
has me holed up out here'

09:54.994 --> 09:55.893
'in the wildest pad.'

09:55.895 --> 09:57.828
- Where, Paul? Where?
- 'Who knows where?'

09:57.830 --> 10:01.799
'Some creeps chloroformed me
this morning, brought me here.'

10:02.735 --> 10:04.668
- Mr. Freeze.
- 'Yeah.'

10:04.670 --> 10:07.004
How much do you want
for Diamante's release?

10:07.006 --> 10:11.709
'How much I want?
Ha ha ha.'

10:11.944 --> 10:15.846
'Nothing, not
one single mark.'

10:15.848 --> 10:17.281
'I mean, uh, cent.'

10:17.283 --> 10:20.985
- 'No money. None.'
- Then what?

10:20.987 --> 10:22.520
'Simple, very simple.'

10:22.522 --> 10:28.259
'I will trade even.
One baseball pitcher...for..'

10:28.961 --> 10:31.095
'...one Batman.'

10:31.097 --> 10:33.264
Absolutely out
of the question.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.733
As protector of our city,
I cannot allow you

10:35.735 --> 10:38.035
to deliberately jeopardize
your very life.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.837
Over me dead body
you'll go.

10:39.839 --> 10:42.706
Sorry, Diamante is
the idol of millions of

10:42.708 --> 10:45.242
impressionable young lads
who look up to him.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.546
He must live to inspire
the youth of today

10:48.548 --> 10:51.148
who will be
the men of tomorrow.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.119
I accept your terms.
Where and when do we meet?

10:55.121 --> 10:57.221
'Alone?'

10:57.223 --> 10:59.690
Alone.

11:02.094 --> 11:05.996
You may speak freely.
No one's listening in.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.333
I'll be there.

11:10.202 --> 11:15.706
Robin, this is one time
I'll have to go out alone.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.677
I gave my word.

11:29.856 --> 11:34.059
<i> A hot flash for</i>
<i> the chilly Mr. Freeze.</i>

11:35.228 --> 11:38.830
<i> Will Robin just stand by?</i>

11:40.801 --> 11:43.301
If Muhammad won't come to
the mountain, Master Dick

11:43.303 --> 11:45.904
the mountain must
come to Muhammad.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.906
Time for afternoon tea.

11:47.908 --> 11:48.773
Holy interruptions.

11:49.175 --> 11:52.010
Who has time for afternoon
tea at a time like this?

11:52.012 --> 11:55.113
Wellington did.
Even at Waterloo.

11:55.515 --> 12:00.652
Well, I suppose a little
extra energy wouldn't hurt.

12:00.854 --> 12:04.255
- Uh, where's Mister Bruce?
- There.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.056
What?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.525
I secretly planted
a homing device on him.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.529
Secretly? Master Dick, am I to
understand that you've been

12:11.531 --> 12:13.932
shadowing the master without
his knowledge or approval?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.134
Holy Sherlock Holmes.
How can I help him

12:16.136 --> 12:17.902
if I don't know
where he is?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.305
- He's in danger then.
- Plenty.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.741
- Where?
- There.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.978
Right in the middle
of nowhere.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.428
You okay, Paul?
Take it easy.

13:16.430 --> 13:19.964
I think so.
Batman?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.267
Take it easy.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.070
I'm prepared to fulfill
my part of the bargain.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.472
Do with me what you will.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.031
Mr. Diamante,
you A-okay?

13:53.033 --> 13:55.800
What happened?
Robin, the boy wonder.

13:55.802 --> 13:59.838
Take it easy. They've got
Batman. I've been following 'em.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.841
I secretly planted
a homing device on him.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.810
Watch that pitching arm.

14:10.417 --> 14:15.186
<i> Later, in the super</i>
<i> refrigerated hideout</i>

14:15.188 --> 14:16.454
<i> of Mr. Freeze</i>

14:16.456 --> 14:18.189
<i> Batman is gradually recovering</i>

14:18.191 --> 14:23.228
<i> after the cowardly attack</i>
<i> behind his back.</i>

14:28.401 --> 14:29.267
My utility belt.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.137
Is this what
you're looking for?

14:33.473 --> 14:37.342
Very ingenious,
this utility belt.

14:37.344 --> 14:41.446
Bat-rope, Bat-arang,
explosives

14:41.448 --> 14:44.282
gas pellets
and other things.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.151
Such imagination.

14:46.153 --> 14:50.855
A most useful thing to have.
When you have it.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.524
If I were you, Batman

14:52.526 --> 14:57.195
I would not try to move
from your nice heated area.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.897
It is not only foolish

14:58.899 --> 15:02.200
to go from a nice warm
76 degrees temperature

15:02.202 --> 15:04.803
to a 50 degree
below zero temperature.

15:04.805 --> 15:08.173
It is also very dangerous
to the system.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.445
You see,
even through your glove

15:14.447 --> 15:18.883
the cold air penetrates
like a thousand needles.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.120
Am I not right?

15:22.122 --> 15:27.258
- I am right.
- You're right, you cold fish.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.227
What next?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.896
That depends.
It depends, uh..

15:31.898 --> 15:37.468
Ultimately of course, you will
die, but how, when, where.

15:37.470 --> 15:41.506
Mercilessly fast
or agonizingly slow.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.876
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

15:44.878 --> 15:47.478
- On you.
- Me?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.146
And me.

15:48.148 --> 15:54.352
On how you act and how
I feel when the time comes.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.223
I-It depends.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.465
You fool.
You fool!

16:07.467 --> 16:12.036
I warned you against sudden
changes in temperature.

16:12.372 --> 16:16.274
The air freezing your lungs.
Yeah?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.509
Cold, frigid, frosty air

16:18.511 --> 16:21.246
freezing your lungs
solid like icicle.

16:21.248 --> 16:24.215
Now you know how
I fell when the air is warm

16:24.217 --> 16:27.485
and I cannot breathe
like you cannot now.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.054
You are freezing, yeah?

16:30.056 --> 16:34.225
If I choose I can make
you freeze to death.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.127
But not yet.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.096
Not yet.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.165
You must not
die too easy.

16:43.069 --> 16:45.103
Now.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.540
Press a button.

16:49.542 --> 16:54.512
Nice warm 76 degrees
temperature.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.916
With this, I control
your every move.

16:57.918 --> 17:02.320
I can decide where you can
go and where you cannot go.

17:02.322 --> 17:07.525
Now, you follow nice
hot path to dining room.

17:35.689 --> 17:39.424
Did I forget to mention that we
have another guest for dinner?

17:39.426 --> 17:43.261
Somebody who just
decided to drop in.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.466
Come-come, you two.

17:48.468 --> 17:52.070
You've scarcely said two words
to each other the whole meal.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.606
What's the matter?
You don't like me roast beef?

17:55.608 --> 17:58.076
Oh, I know.
It's the spinach.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.745
Let the boy go.
He's never done you harm.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.248
His only crime was disobeying
my order not to fallow me

18:04.250 --> 18:06.451
by planting that
homing device on me.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.320
You have my deepest
sympathy, Batman.

18:09.322 --> 18:15.226
Unfortunately, the boy now knows
this hideout so what can I do?

18:16.696 --> 18:20.064
Ah, Baked Alaska.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.499
My favorite dessert.

18:21.501 --> 18:26.537
We will have with it, uh, some
of this very special liqueur.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.040
Chilled ever so slightly.

18:29.042 --> 18:32.477
Uh, 10 seconds in my hands..

18:32.479 --> 18:33.378
...cools it properly.

18:33.380 --> 18:37.682
Uh, 30 seconds for champagne,
and one minute for martini.

18:37.684 --> 18:41.119
- Nice and cold.
- None for me, thank you.

18:41.121 --> 18:45.423
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot you do not drink.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.793
Then have your Baked Alaska.

18:48.795 --> 18:53.264
You know, in some ways
I-I'm so sorry that

18:53.266 --> 18:56.300
I have to destroy
such charming people.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.704
- It is a great pity.
- Mr. Freeze..

18:59.706 --> 19:01.572
...give yourself up.

19:01.574 --> 19:05.309
We can get help for you.
Medical help.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.412
In prison?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.113
This I do not believe.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.617
'No, you must pay
for what you did to me.'

19:12.619 --> 19:15.286
For forcing me
to live like this.

19:15.288 --> 19:19.057
Never again to know
the warmth of a summer breeze.

19:19.059 --> 19:24.562
Never to feel the heat of
burning logs in winter time.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.197
Revenge.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.598
That is what I need.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.869
Revenge!
I will have revenge!

19:30.871 --> 19:32.537
Now!

19:35.876 --> 19:38.343
Batman!
The cold!

19:48.888 --> 19:50.588
Sorry, slipped
on the Baked Alaska.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.224
You tried. That's the true
measure of a man.

19:53.226 --> 19:56.026
Whether you win or lose,
to try.

19:56.028 --> 20:03.133
And now, you will know what it
feels like to freeze to death.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.870
Slowly.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.774
Slowly.

20:10.844 --> 20:12.644
Slowly.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.180
Ha ha ha.
Charming, isn't it?

20:15.982 --> 20:16.881
Yeah, very charmed.

20:17.083 --> 20:22.920
Now, I press the button and
there's only room for one.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.726
- Stay!
- No, Batman.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.129
That's an order, boy.

20:31.131 --> 20:32.664
This is fun.

20:32.666 --> 20:37.435
Now, Robin will be able
to watch you die first.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.069
Batman..

20:38.071 --> 20:42.106
In a few seconds you will
not be able to move at all.

20:42.108 --> 20:45.677
Now, tell me, Batman,
how does it feel?

20:45.679 --> 20:49.647
How does it feel
to freeze to death?

20:53.253 --> 20:58.022
Right, on the button.
Turnabout is fair play.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.336
Naturally, you didn't
know I was wearing my

21:12.338 --> 21:16.340
special super thermal
B-long underwear

21:16.342 --> 21:18.542
for extreme cold.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.611
You mean,
you pretended to freeze?

21:20.613 --> 21:23.047
It'll be a colder day
than 50 below zero

21:23.049 --> 21:25.816
before you beat Batman,
Mr. Freeze.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.385
Help me!
Help me!

21:27.387 --> 21:28.953
Freeze him an area
jail cell size.

21:28.955 --> 21:33.057
That should hold him
till we get to the cooler.

21:34.994 --> 21:39.497
Batman!
Up! Up, up!

21:51.711 --> 21:54.578
The guns, drop them.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.881
No-no! Wait, wait!

22:01.654 --> 22:04.989
Back to the cooler,
Dr. Shivel.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.693
Now, gentlemen.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.661
Two against three.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.563
I'd say the odds are even.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.010
Ah! This is..

22:58.911 --> 22:59.810
What took you so long?

22:59.812 --> 23:02.847
I phoned you before I came
in here an hour ago.

23:02.849 --> 23:06.751
We took a wrong turn
off route 49.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.593
'Say "cheese."'

23:15.595 --> 23:18.429
Oh, get hip.
Not cheese.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.431
Mr. Freeze.

23:20.433 --> 23:24.669
Alright, one more, one more.
Thank you, thank you.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.371
Thank you.
Well, commissioner..

23:30.677 --> 23:32.543
Bruce.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.678
Oh, you old stick-in-the-muds.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.949
Off to a silly board meeting in
the middle of a baseball game.

23:37.951 --> 23:38.950
How could you?

23:39.152 --> 23:41.452
Work before
pleasure, princess.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.521
How do you feel
after your ordeal, Paul?

23:43.723 --> 23:45.823
Great! Feel like
pitching tomorrow.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.660
We can sure use you, especially
against those Motor City wheels.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.995
Oh, I wish Batman and Robin
could've been here.

23:51.997 --> 23:56.166
I would love to have thanked
them personally for this.

23:56.168 --> 23:56.967
And for this.

23:56.969 --> 24:01.471
On behalf of all the loyal
Gotham city fans of course.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.875
Oh, there you are, boys.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.645
You're just in
time for the dessert.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.514
Gabriel, bring it in.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.790
Baked Alaska!

24:26.001 --> 24:28.368
