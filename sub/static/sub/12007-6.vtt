00:01.795 --> 00:04.730
- Isn't it past your curfew?
- My house arrest is up.

00:04.764 --> 00:05.798
This calls for a toast.

00:05.832 --> 00:07.833
- To the night.
- To the night.

00:07.867 --> 00:10.002
<i>Tank: I know you probably
think last night was a mistake,</i>

00:10.036 --> 00:12.638
- I always wanted it to happen, but...
- Did we use anything?

00:12.672 --> 00:13.806
Yes, of course.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.874
My friend Tess talked to me
about something that happened.

00:15.909 --> 00:18.610
She got really drunk.

00:19.005 --> 00:21.940
She found out that she had had sex

00:21.974 --> 00:22.974
with someone else.

00:23.009 --> 00:24.910
- Well, that's awful.
- That she cheated.

00:24.944 --> 00:26.812
- That she was raped.
- What?

00:26.846 --> 00:29.715
Well, if she was so drunk that she
couldn't remember it the next day,

00:29.749 --> 00:31.016
then she didn't give consent.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.585
If you had said, "no," at any
point, I would have stopped.

00:33.619 --> 00:36.354
But if I can't remember
it, how can that be okay?

00:36.389 --> 00:37.723
We had sex, Bay.

00:37.757 --> 00:39.224
It was not assault.

00:39.258 --> 00:41.593
When I woke up, I felt...

00:41.627 --> 00:43.228
like something was wrong.

00:43.262 --> 00:45.297
Just tell me what you
want to do and we'll do it.

00:45.331 --> 00:47.265
I just want to forget about it.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.433
Then that's what we'll do.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.274
Hey! I got your message

00:56.309 --> 00:59.811
to stop by... wow, check out your new digs.

00:59.846 --> 01:00.846
Nice.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.420

01:34.423 --> 01:37.149
Nothing happened between me and Tank.

01:37.650 --> 01:40.304

01:40.386 --> 01:42.287
I'm not even a student here.

_

01:51.297 --> 01:54.970
_

01:54.971 --> 01:57.736
No, no. I definitely
do not want to do that.

01:58.137 --> 02:03.852
_

02:04.353 --> 02:08.175
_

02:08.281 --> 02:11.283
Melody, please. I really
just want this to die.

02:11.284 --> 02:13.150
_

02:13.219 --> 02:15.253
Well, I'm not going to
talk to anyone about this.

02:15.254 --> 02:18.449
_

02:18.591 --> 02:21.193
Thank you. Okay.

02:22.361 --> 02:24.162
All right, so, that's the end, right?

02:25.163 --> 02:27.093
_

02:27.094 --> 02:30.366
_

02:30.737 --> 02:32.270
But I don't want that.

02:32.305 --> 02:34.139
Isn't there something that you could do?

02:34.173 --> 02:35.841
Please, Melody, I'm begging you.

02:36.142 --> 02:38.136

I thought you understood
that this was part of my job.

02:53.759 --> 02:55.827
I had to tell Melody what Tank told you.

02:55.862 --> 02:58.697
I only told you because I was trying
to figure out how I felt about it.

02:58.731 --> 02:59.931
Not so you could blab to your boss.

02:59.966 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, I understand that,
but it involves a student.

03:02.034 --> 03:03.735
You don't even know what happened!

03:05.771 --> 03:07.072
That's what the investigation is for,

03:07.106 --> 03:09.841
and if there's even a chance
that he's victimized Bay,

03:09.876 --> 03:11.109
we are required to look into it.

03:11.343 --> 03:13.111
So you're covering your ass?

03:13.145 --> 03:15.714
I'm looking out for Bay,

03:15.748 --> 03:18.049
and I would have done the same
for any girl in her position.

03:19.285 --> 03:23.121
I should have told you first,
and I'm really sorry about that,

03:23.155 --> 03:24.823
but it was the right thing to do.

Does anyone know it was me?

04:50.876 --> 04:53.078
I don't think so, but
she said they're gonna

04:53.112 --> 04:56.047
interview everyone who was at the party.

04:56.082 --> 04:58.950
Where they'll be asked
questions about me...

04:58.985 --> 05:03.688
And they'll probably talk to
their friends and... oh God.

05:03.723 --> 05:05.857
Emmett.

05:05.891 --> 05:07.092
I have to tell him.

05:11.097 --> 05:13.698
Hey. Hey!

05:13.733 --> 05:15.000
Bay, wait up.

05:16.869 --> 05:19.070
I just got a call to show
up at some Dean's office?

05:19.105 --> 05:20.972
You reported me?

05:21.007 --> 05:22.941
Toby told Lily

05:22.975 --> 05:24.843
what you said to him,

05:24.877 --> 05:27.112
and she ran with it.

05:27.146 --> 05:28.947
They tried to pull me in too.

05:28.981 --> 05:31.149
Well, you're gonna tell them
it wasn't assault, right?

05:31.183 --> 05:34.819
I told Melody that I wanted nothing
to do with the investigation.

05:34.854 --> 05:36.921
Okay, so... is it over?

05:36.956 --> 05:38.056
I mean, they dropped it, right?

05:38.090 --> 05:40.158
I don't know. You...

05:40.192 --> 05:42.093
You should talk to them.
I really have to go.

05:42.128 --> 05:44.195
Wait, this is how it's gonna
be? You can't even talk to me?

05:44.230 --> 05:46.931
Hey, she said she doesn't
want to talk to you right now.

05:46.966 --> 05:49.067
So unless you want a second
call from administration

05:49.101 --> 05:50.201
you better back the hell off.

05:50.236 --> 05:51.836
(Scoffs)

05:54.807 --> 05:57.008
- (Breathing heavily)
- Okay, he's gone. It's okay.

05:57.043 --> 05:59.644
What's happening? I
can't... I can't breathe.

06:00.846 --> 06:02.614
- Sit down.
- (Breathing heavily)

06:02.648 --> 06:04.749
I think you're having a panic attack.

06:04.784 --> 06:07.452
So just focus on your breathing,

06:07.486 --> 06:09.721
and we're gonna count to 10, okay?

06:09.755 --> 06:11.656
One...

06:11.690 --> 06:13.458
- Two.
- I don't know, I don't know. (Panting)

06:13.492 --> 06:15.326
We're just counting.
That's all we're doing.

06:15.361 --> 06:16.761
- Three.
- Four.

06:16.796 --> 06:18.496
- Four.
- Five.

06:18.531 --> 06:21.533
- Six. Seven.
- You're doing great. Good job, Bay.

06:21.567 --> 06:22.567
Eight...

06:23.602 --> 06:26.471
Girl: That movie totally
stole from Fritz Lang.

06:26.505 --> 06:28.239
I mean, even thought the
ending was way better...

06:28.240 --> 06:30.928
_

06:31.343 --> 06:33.278
And USC still let you in.

06:33.279 --> 06:35.007
_

06:35.008 --> 06:38.417
_

06:39.151 --> 06:42.087
Well, if you want to catch up to us...

06:42.121 --> 06:44.989
film school nerds,

06:45.024 --> 06:48.059
I just got this from my friend.

06:48.094 --> 06:49.961
You wanna watch it tomorrow?

06:51.162 --> 06:54.400
_

06:54.967 --> 06:56.000
Um...

06:57.036 --> 06:59.003
We... we broke up.

07:00.104 --> 07:02.874
- _
- Yeah.

07:02.908 --> 07:06.611
We were together for four years,

07:06.645 --> 07:09.848
but the distance got to us.

07:11.717 --> 07:13.418
But movies

07:13.452 --> 07:15.720
always make me feel better.

07:16.856 --> 07:18.356
You wanna check it off your list?

07:18.390 --> 07:20.725
I have bacon popcorn.

07:23.106 --> 07:26.090
_

07:26.632 --> 07:28.266
I understand.

07:28.267 --> 07:31.016
_

07:31.017 --> 07:33.510
_

07:33.515 --> 07:34.405
Okay.

07:42.248 --> 07:44.384
Do you really think that people are gonna

07:44.385 --> 07:46.056
want to play these at the coffeehouse?

07:46.152 --> 07:48.153
Vintage games are very in.

07:48.187 --> 07:51.956
Well, this one's missing, like,
half its pieces and its rules.

07:51.991 --> 07:53.825
Hmm. Toss it.

07:56.028 --> 07:58.096
Uh, speaking of rules...

07:59.365 --> 08:02.667
I know that you said that
sometimes it's okay to interfere

08:02.701 --> 08:04.002
with people's personal lives.

08:04.036 --> 08:06.771
- Like with Sharee's mom.
- Yeah.

08:06.805 --> 08:08.706
So, I have this friend,

08:08.741 --> 08:11.843
and she got really drunk,

08:11.877 --> 08:13.745
and apparently slept with this guy

08:13.779 --> 08:14.846
without remembering it,

08:14.880 --> 08:17.582
but she doesn't want
to do anything about it.

08:17.616 --> 08:19.450
But I can tell that it's affecting her

08:19.485 --> 08:21.519
physically, mentally, all that.

08:21.554 --> 08:24.389
- Is this about Tess?
- What?

08:24.423 --> 08:27.258
Oh, nothing. Go on.

08:29.261 --> 08:32.397
- The same story as Bay?
- Same story, different friend.

08:32.431 --> 08:34.164
Who do you think it is?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.134
I don't think it's a friend at all.

08:36.168 --> 08:37.402
Have you noticed anything odd?

08:37.436 --> 08:40.337
Now that you mention it,
Bay has seemed really down

08:40.371 --> 08:42.073
even though she got her ankle monitor off.

08:43.409 --> 08:45.877
- Do you think something happened to her?
- I hope not.

08:46.912 --> 08:49.781
But if we're talking sexual assault,

08:49.815 --> 08:51.749
and there is even the slightest
chance that it's Bay...

08:51.784 --> 08:53.751
We need to talk to her.

08:53.786 --> 08:54.819
Yeah.

09:03.729 --> 09:04.796
Hey.

09:05.697 --> 09:09.477
_

09:09.678 --> 09:12.841
_

09:12.842 --> 09:16.413
_

09:16.714 --> 09:18.292
_

09:18.893 --> 09:22.780
_

09:22.781 --> 09:24.551
_

09:24.552 --> 09:27.771
_

09:28.072 --> 09:30.434
_

09:32.458 --> 09:34.025
Sure.

09:34.060 --> 09:36.194
I mean, fine. Yeah, sure.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.279
_

09:40.080 --> 09:41.583
_

09:42.001 --> 09:43.801
I'm not mad. I...

09:44.970 --> 09:48.773
I just want you to know
that I love you too,

09:48.807 --> 09:49.874
and...

09:49.908 --> 09:52.644
please keep that in mind

09:52.678 --> 09:55.813
when I say what I'm about to say.

09:56.214 --> 09:57.931
_

10:00.653 --> 10:01.919
After you left,

10:01.954 --> 10:05.390
I went to that dorm party,

10:05.424 --> 10:09.594
the one that I was
telling you about, and...

10:09.628 --> 10:11.496
I got pretty drunk.

10:14.466 --> 10:15.633
And something happened...

10:16.669 --> 10:18.202
with Tank.

10:20.403 --> 10:22.803
_

10:23.442 --> 10:24.442
It was more than that.

10:24.443 --> 10:27.211
_

10:27.546 --> 10:29.247
It's complicated.

10:29.248 --> 10:33.290
_

10:33.292 --> 10:36.054
It wasn't like that,
okay? Just listen to me,

10:36.088 --> 10:38.189
and please just let me explain.

10:38.223 --> 10:39.324
<i>If you just... </i>

10:46.413 --> 10:48.648
Ok. What's with the mom ambush?

10:48.682 --> 10:51.217
It's not an ambush.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.386
We're just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.

10:55.289 --> 10:56.322
Want some cocoa?

10:56.356 --> 10:59.025
Thanks, I'm fine.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.062
So, you got your ankle monitor off.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.196
That had to have felt good.

11:05.766 --> 11:09.201
So good you went to a party and stayed
out all night, and you didn't call us.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.904
Which I explained.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.173
And it's pretty clear you'd been drinking.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.142
I hate to break it to you guys,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.926
but I have had a drink before.

11:18.525 --> 11:20.793
Sweetie, I need to ask you something.

11:20.828 --> 11:22.795
When you told me about your friend Tess,

11:22.830 --> 11:26.699
who got so drunk that she didn't
remember sleeping with a guy...

11:26.734 --> 11:28.601
I told you that in confidence.

11:28.635 --> 11:30.403
I know,

11:30.437 --> 11:32.371
but now I need to know.

11:32.406 --> 11:33.639
Was that girl you?

11:35.309 --> 11:37.210
God, you guys,

11:37.244 --> 11:39.479
don't you think I would
come to you if I wanted

11:39.513 --> 11:41.214
to talk about something like that?

11:41.248 --> 11:43.149
If something happened to you,

11:43.183 --> 11:44.183
you need to tell us.

11:46.186 --> 11:48.020
Regina: You know what I
said about your friend Tess,

11:48.055 --> 11:50.823
if something happened
without her consent...

11:50.858 --> 11:52.959
I know, but you weren't there, okay?

11:52.993 --> 11:54.894
Nobody was there except for me and...

11:56.730 --> 11:57.930
This other person.

11:57.965 --> 11:59.665
Oh my God, Bay.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.601
Mom, I'm fine.

12:01.635 --> 12:05.772
It was a mistake. It was
a stupid, drunk mistake.

12:05.806 --> 12:07.607
Regina: No. Listen,

12:07.641 --> 12:09.642
if someone did something to you

12:09.676 --> 12:10.910
that you didn't want

12:10.944 --> 12:12.812
we need to take action before
he does it to someone else.

12:12.846 --> 12:16.349
It wasn't some monster
rapist. It was my ex-boyfriend.

12:16.383 --> 12:17.383
Tank?

12:17.417 --> 12:18.651
(Sighs)

12:20.654 --> 12:23.356
Sometimes good guys can do bad things.

12:23.390 --> 12:26.492
There are no good guys
or bad guys... (Stammers)

12:26.527 --> 12:28.427
This is why I didn't
want to talk about this.

12:28.462 --> 12:29.562
Bay.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.340
(Buttons clicking)

12:44.344 --> 12:46.012
Hey.

12:46.046 --> 12:49.148
I cheated on him. That's all Emmett thinks.

12:49.183 --> 12:51.117
So you told him?

12:53.887 --> 12:57.790
The school's doing a whole investigation,

12:57.825 --> 13:00.760
whether I want it or
not, so I had to tell him.

13:01.995 --> 13:03.529
Honey...

13:04.531 --> 13:06.732
I know you feel like you
did something wrong...

13:06.767 --> 13:08.835
Yeah, I had sex,

13:08.869 --> 13:12.471
not with my boyfriend, and now
everybody gets to talk about it.

13:12.506 --> 13:14.340
Oh God, dad...

13:15.709 --> 13:17.677
Now look, I'll take care of dad,

13:17.711 --> 13:19.312
but you need to hear this;

13:20.380 --> 13:22.381
you did nothing wrong.

13:22.416 --> 13:23.516
How do you know that?

13:23.550 --> 13:25.484
I don't even know that, mom. I blacked out.

13:27.187 --> 13:29.055
What I'm trying to say is,

13:30.524 --> 13:33.159
a lot of women don't trust that voice

13:33.193 --> 13:35.261
inside them when something is happening

13:35.295 --> 13:37.330
that they don't want or they don't like.

13:39.032 --> 13:40.867
They don't know how to say, "stop."

13:41.935 --> 13:43.736
God, mom. That's not me.

13:43.770 --> 13:45.705
I'm not some victim, and
you just don't get this.

13:55.782 --> 13:56.782
Hey.

13:57.683 --> 14:00.323
_

14:01.521 --> 14:04.390
<i>DVD... oh, Sunrise. Yeah, I have it.</i>

14:04.691 --> 14:05.980
_

14:05.981 --> 14:09.930
_

14:09.934 --> 14:10.730
Okay, sure.

14:16.703 --> 14:18.404
Emmett won't talk to me.

14:18.438 --> 14:21.307
What? After you told him...

14:21.341 --> 14:24.176
I've been texting, I've been FaceTiming,

14:24.211 --> 14:25.211
no response.

14:25.245 --> 14:27.280
Oh, Emmett, what are you doing?

14:27.314 --> 14:31.217
If I wasn't on probation
I would just go to L.A.,

14:31.251 --> 14:33.119
and make him talk to me.

14:34.321 --> 14:35.888
What if I went for you?

14:36.890 --> 14:38.224
To L.A.?

14:38.258 --> 14:40.793
I still have a credit from the
flight that I canceled to Gallaudet.

14:40.827 --> 14:42.695
Daphne, I don't know.

14:42.729 --> 14:44.063
After everything you've done for me,

14:44.097 --> 14:45.765
please, let me do this for you.

14:46.967 --> 14:47.967
Unless you need me here.

14:48.969 --> 14:50.736
I'll be fine for two days,

14:52.039 --> 14:55.741
and I'll be a lot better if you
can just get Emmett to talk to me.

14:55.776 --> 14:58.477
Then I'm going to L.A.

14:58.512 --> 14:59.578
Thank you.

15:06.684 --> 15:07.351
Tank.

15:07.385 --> 15:09.953
I'm sure he has a different
version of what happened.

15:09.988 --> 15:12.189
Honey, please, there's more to
the story that you should hear.

15:12.223 --> 15:13.924
- Just sit down.
- I want to hear it from him.

15:13.958 --> 15:14.992
John, no. Please.

15:15.026 --> 15:16.060
I want him to look me in the eye...

15:16.094 --> 15:17.828
I told Bay that you could handle this.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.030
Please, John, don't be that guy.

15:20.065 --> 15:21.932
I just want to talk to him.

15:21.966 --> 15:24.134
Bay needs our help, not for
you to fly off the handle.

15:24.169 --> 15:25.736
Is he still at Toby's?

15:25.770 --> 15:26.904
I... don't know.

15:26.938 --> 15:28.839
- I'll find out.
- John...

15:29.841 --> 15:31.608
John?

15:31.643 --> 15:32.643
(Door slams)

15:40.485 --> 15:41.719
Oh. Hey, you're here.

15:43.688 --> 15:44.755
You're done with practice already?

15:46.006 --> 15:49.776
_

15:49.779 --> 15:53.330
About the girl who blacked
out and got taken advantage of?

16:06.551 --> 16:08.256
_

16:08.480 --> 16:10.314
Oh no.

16:10.348 --> 16:11.348
Bay?

16:12.149 --> 16:14.875
_

16:14.876 --> 16:17.854
_

16:17.855 --> 16:19.760
_

16:19.761 --> 16:21.537
_

16:21.960 --> 16:23.694
Did you know she was in trouble?

16:23.695 --> 16:25.541
_

16:25.742 --> 16:27.761
_

16:28.133 --> 16:31.602
So how did you know you were
supposed to look out for her?

16:32.971 --> 16:34.772
Bay is an adult.

16:34.773 --> 16:37.188
_

16:37.709 --> 16:41.812
Meaning, I feel awful for her, but...

16:41.846 --> 16:44.581
She shouldn't have drunk so much

16:44.616 --> 16:45.616
that she blacked out.

16:45.617 --> 16:48.176
_

16:48.353 --> 16:51.588
No, I'm saying she shouldn't have
put herself in that situation.

16:52.689 --> 16:55.805
_

16:56.094 --> 16:58.262
Because I'm a girl.

16:58.296 --> 17:00.063
I know we have to be smart.

17:00.098 --> 17:02.166
We can't let our guard down.

17:02.200 --> 17:06.136
It sucks it's that way for
us, but that's how it is.

17:06.137 --> 17:08.183
_

17:09.107 --> 17:10.140
(Scoffs)

17:17.949 --> 17:19.148
(Doorknob turns)

17:26.023 --> 17:27.624
Toby's not here.

17:27.659 --> 17:28.725
I'm looking for you.

17:30.728 --> 17:33.630
Can you tell me why I shouldn't
kick your ass right now?

17:34.933 --> 17:36.667
Will you listen to my side first?

17:36.701 --> 17:39.603
What, that she somehow led you on?

17:39.637 --> 17:41.438
No.

17:41.472 --> 17:43.407
We had been drinking, a lot.

17:43.441 --> 17:45.609
We weren't thinking
clearly, neither one of us.

17:45.643 --> 17:47.377
But you're the guy, Tank.

17:47.412 --> 17:50.280
You're a foot taller, and
you got 100 lbs. on her.

17:51.349 --> 17:53.283
I don't care how drunk you are,

17:53.318 --> 17:56.353
it falls on you to be in
control of the situation.

17:56.387 --> 17:58.989
Do you think I would hurt her on purpose?

18:02.393 --> 18:04.127
When she had to take
the morning-after pill,

18:04.162 --> 18:05.229
and you thought that was because of me,

18:05.263 --> 18:07.064
I let you think that, remember?

18:07.098 --> 18:09.900
So you wouldn't yell at her,
even though I knew in that moment

18:09.934 --> 18:11.802
she had cheated on me.

18:11.836 --> 18:13.904
That would have been within my
right to hang her out to dry.

18:13.938 --> 18:14.972
I didn't,

18:15.006 --> 18:16.707
'cause I care about her that much.

18:18.710 --> 18:21.979
Now you think the same guy would take
advantage of her when she's drunk?

18:22.013 --> 18:23.847
Wait a second, you said you were drunk too.

18:23.882 --> 18:25.849
I would never cross that line.

18:25.884 --> 18:27.951
Look, Mr. Kennish,

18:27.986 --> 18:29.720
it's not what you're imagining.

18:29.754 --> 18:31.788
I swear...

18:31.823 --> 18:33.590
I thought I had a green light.

18:36.761 --> 18:39.296
<i>(Dramatic music playing)</i>

18:44.235 --> 18:47.371
The guy tries to kill his wife,

18:47.405 --> 18:49.473
but even they got back together in the end.

18:50.274 --> 18:54.747
_

18:56.481 --> 19:00.250
No, it's a perfect film.

19:00.285 --> 19:04.855
My boyfriend never would
have watched this with me.

19:05.090 --> 19:08.975
<i>His idea of classic film is Norbit. So... </i>

19:09.026 --> 19:12.900
_

19:13.401 --> 19:17.457
_

19:17.769 --> 19:22.606
Yeah, and still call it studying. (Laughs)

19:23.107 --> 19:28.820
_

19:28.821 --> 19:30.510
_

19:30.511 --> 19:34.840
_

19:34.852 --> 19:39.589
That's how I felt about Indiana.

19:43.090 --> 19:48.193
_

19:48.194 --> 19:52.761
_

19:54.405 --> 19:57.274
I've actually been thinking the same thing.

20:04.575 --> 20:08.658
_

20:08.659 --> 20:13.650
_

20:13.825 --> 20:14.858
(Laughing)

20:23.759 --> 20:25.999
_

20:32.643 --> 20:33.577
Hey.

20:36.314 --> 20:38.582
We don't have to talk about
it. I just wanted to...

20:38.616 --> 20:39.583
They know.

20:41.352 --> 20:42.319
Who?

20:42.353 --> 20:44.388
Everyone. They know it was me.

20:44.422 --> 20:46.189
What? How?

20:46.224 --> 20:48.458
There's this article
on the campus news site.

20:48.519 --> 20:51.120
The newspaper printed your name?

20:51.155 --> 20:53.256
No, I'm just "girl X" in the article,

20:53.290 --> 20:55.058
but in the comments...

20:57.759 --> 21:04.100
_

21:04.134 --> 21:05.802
Maybe they're right about me.

21:07.871 --> 21:08.871
Stop looking at this.

21:10.174 --> 21:12.875
Just because you turn off the
computer doesn't make it not true.

21:12.910 --> 21:14.944
What are you talking about?

21:16.814 --> 21:18.948
I cheated on one boyfriend, probably two.

21:18.982 --> 21:20.683
I mean, isn't that what a slut does?

21:20.717 --> 21:25.488
Bay, these are crazy Internet
people. They don't know you.

21:25.522 --> 21:27.523
There's just so many of them.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.427
Obsessing about this is not gonna help.

21:31.462 --> 21:33.262
You need to shut out the lies

21:33.297 --> 21:35.398
and hold on to what you
know to be the truth.

21:37.601 --> 21:39.302
This is a nightmare.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.278
Look at this.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.315
This is what Bay is reading about herself,

21:55.350 --> 21:57.050
on top of everything
else she's going through.

21:57.051 --> 21:58.823
_

21:59.187 --> 22:01.188
They know it's Bay.

22:03.109 --> 22:04.310
_

22:04.827 --> 22:07.794
You tell me. You started the investigation.

22:08.195 --> 22:10.776
_

22:11.077 --> 22:14.703
_

22:14.704 --> 22:17.860
_

22:18.061 --> 22:21.274
_

22:21.475 --> 22:24.319
_

22:24.612 --> 22:26.446
University procedure?

22:26.481 --> 22:27.614
What about protecting her?

22:27.615 --> 22:30.000
_

22:30.001 --> 22:31.850
_

22:31.953 --> 22:34.454
This does not look like protection.

22:34.489 --> 22:37.224
I'm doing everything I can, Regina.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.448
_

22:40.449 --> 22:43.951
_

22:43.952 --> 22:45.663
_

22:45.664 --> 22:47.497
_

22:49.971 --> 22:51.872
I know. I'm sorry.

22:54.909 --> 22:55.976
I just...

22:57.111 --> 22:58.779
I don't know what to do for her.

23:00.780 --> 23:05.592
_

23:06.120 --> 23:07.788
I can barely get her to talk about it.

23:08.689 --> 23:12.459
_

23:16.698 --> 23:17.698
I hate this.

23:20.699 --> 23:22.000
_

23:27.901 --> 23:31.266
_

23:31.267 --> 23:34.235
_

23:34.236 --> 23:38.809
_

23:39.110 --> 23:41.000
_

23:41.001 --> 23:43.537
_

23:43.538 --> 23:44.838
_

23:44.839 --> 23:46.869
_

23:46.870 --> 23:48.992
_

23:48.993 --> 23:51.512
_

23:51.513 --> 23:54.311
_

23:54.312 --> 23:55.640
_

23:55.641 --> 23:58.051
_

23:58.052 --> 24:00.961
_

24:11.593 --> 24:12.626
Knock, knock.

24:13.895 --> 24:15.829
Hey, I just wanted to let you know

24:15.863 --> 24:17.531
that I went and talked to Melody,

24:17.565 --> 24:20.367
and she said that she could
get those comments shut down.

24:21.536 --> 24:22.569
Okay.

24:22.604 --> 24:25.305
And while I was there, I met Alexis.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.242
She works at something called the...

24:28.276 --> 24:30.244
Student crisis center at U.M.K.C.

24:31.412 --> 24:32.512
It's nice to meet you, Bay.

24:32.547 --> 24:34.081
Hi.

24:35.083 --> 24:37.985
Your mom thought you and I
could talk for a little bit.

24:39.254 --> 24:42.055
I figured you wouldn't want
to go down to the campus,

24:42.090 --> 24:44.925
so Alexis nicely agreed to come here.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.159
Alexis: You don't have to say anything,

24:46.194 --> 24:48.262
and you can tell me to go at any point.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
(Door closes)

24:54.789 --> 24:55.822
Who is that?

24:55.857 --> 24:58.892
Someone from the U.M.K.C. crisis center.

24:58.927 --> 25:01.028
- She's an assault survivor.
- Oh.

25:01.062 --> 25:03.664
Oh, did Bay ask her over?

25:03.698 --> 25:04.798
No, I asked her to come,

25:04.832 --> 25:06.833
for Bay to talk to someone
who'd been through this.

25:06.868 --> 25:09.836
How could you do that without
asking Bay or me first?

25:09.871 --> 25:11.772
I thought it would help.

25:11.806 --> 25:15.342
Forcing her to talk to a
complete stranger about it

25:15.376 --> 25:16.510
when she's not ready to?

25:16.544 --> 25:18.478
If I had known someone personally...

25:18.513 --> 25:21.481
You know how embarrassed and
confused she feels about it.

25:21.516 --> 25:23.350
We had to do something.

25:24.686 --> 25:27.621
So, actually, the whole
incident made me stronger.

25:27.655 --> 25:30.123
It really helped me
find my voice, in a way.

25:30.158 --> 25:31.391
Mm-hmm.

25:31.426 --> 25:33.327
I joined a survivor's group,

25:33.361 --> 25:36.396
and we fought to have the university
change its sexual assault policy.

25:38.032 --> 25:40.234
Which was a complete joke, by the way.

25:40.268 --> 25:42.002
There would be pictures taken,

25:42.036 --> 25:43.303
and the guys would still be let off.

25:44.339 --> 25:45.839
That's awful.

25:45.873 --> 25:47.241
But changing the policy isn't enough.

25:47.275 --> 25:49.176
We have to change the culture.

25:50.845 --> 25:51.834
People think if you know your assailant,

25:51.835 --> 25:53.911
it automatically means
the sex was consensual.

25:54.115 --> 25:56.984
Well, no... (Stammers)

25:57.018 --> 25:59.086
I... I know that's not true. Um...

25:59.120 --> 26:03.957
I was really drunk, which, uh...

26:03.992 --> 26:05.892
- Confuses things.
- No, it doesn't.

26:05.927 --> 26:07.894
It's not your fault.

26:07.929 --> 26:10.497
I'm kind of, just...

26:11.532 --> 26:12.766
still figuring it out.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.901
You know, we're having a rally
on campus. You should come.

26:14.936 --> 26:19.406
I don't really want to be the
poster girl for campus rape.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.441
No, you don't have to
give a speech or anything,

26:21.476 --> 26:23.477
but you might find it kind of empowering,

26:23.511 --> 26:26.413
being a part of something bigger than you.

26:26.447 --> 26:29.283
(Stammers) Okay, I just need a minute.

26:31.152 --> 26:32.152
Excuse me.

26:34.555 --> 26:36.156
Why is she investigating...

26:36.190 --> 26:37.124
- (door opens)
- Bay: Hey.

26:37.158 --> 26:39.226
I did not ask you to bring her here.

26:39.260 --> 26:42.996
I do not want to be part of some movement
or changing the culture, all right?

26:46.367 --> 26:47.367
I'm sorry.

27:10.958 --> 27:12.592
I just thought...

27:13.928 --> 27:16.697
But it's everywhere. It's on my phone.

27:17.732 --> 27:18.799
It's in my house.

27:20.735 --> 27:23.704
I don't even know what to
think anymore because everyone's

27:23.738 --> 27:24.905
trying to think for me.

27:27.809 --> 27:29.309
I understand, sweetie,

27:29.344 --> 27:31.712
but I think you're so busy
shutting everyone out that...

27:33.414 --> 27:35.215
you're shutting yourself out too.

27:37.518 --> 27:38.585
I know what that feels like.

27:41.322 --> 27:43.390
I had something happen to me a very...

27:45.393 --> 27:49.029
very long time ago that I didn't want.

27:51.165 --> 27:52.232
How old were you?

27:54.068 --> 27:55.268
I was just 17.

27:57.338 --> 27:59.239
My best girlfriend's brother.

28:01.175 --> 28:04.077
I was sleeping over at
their house, and I...

28:05.179 --> 28:06.880
I woke up...

28:07.915 --> 28:09.750
to find his hands in...

28:11.953 --> 28:13.754
places that they shouldn't have been.

28:15.022 --> 28:16.022
Mom...

28:17.792 --> 28:18.959
Did you tell anybody?

28:20.695 --> 28:21.695
No.

28:25.633 --> 28:26.767
I thought it was my fault,

28:26.801 --> 28:28.402
because I...

28:29.404 --> 28:30.604
couldn't stop it.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.307
And I decided that

28:34.342 --> 28:36.543
since it wasn't intercourse,
it didn't really matter,

28:36.577 --> 28:38.245
which made me feel like...

28:39.280 --> 28:40.380
I didn't really matter.

28:41.549 --> 28:43.183
So listen to me, honey.

28:44.185 --> 28:46.086
What happened to you

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
does matter...

28:49.257 --> 28:53.059
and you're the only one who knows
exactly what you're going through.

28:56.397 --> 28:58.298
You need to speak for yourself.

29:10.938 --> 29:12.839
Before you say anything,

29:12.873 --> 29:14.574
I feel awful about what happened.

29:14.608 --> 29:16.910
Lily took what I said in
private and ran with it.

29:16.944 --> 29:19.612
If it makes you feel any better,
I already yelled at her for it.

29:19.647 --> 29:21.748
You didn't have to do that.
She was just doing her job.

29:22.783 --> 29:24.784
That's not at all what
I expected you to say.

29:25.819 --> 29:28.588
It's done. I'm just
trying to deal with it now.

29:28.622 --> 29:29.789
I have to go talk to Tank.

29:31.525 --> 29:32.659
Are you sure that's a good idea?

29:32.693 --> 29:35.295
There's something I have
to tell him in person.

29:35.329 --> 29:36.462
Do you want me to go with you?

29:36.497 --> 29:37.630
Like, moral support?

29:37.665 --> 29:39.265
I'll be okay, thanks.

29:39.300 --> 29:40.533
Hey.

29:42.369 --> 29:43.570
Is there anything else I can do?

29:45.306 --> 29:46.306
I wish there was.

29:55.507 --> 29:57.739
_

29:59.100 --> 30:02.208
_

30:02.209 --> 30:03.780
_

30:04.181 --> 30:06.305
_

30:06.306 --> 30:09.388
_

30:09.589 --> 30:12.256
_

30:12.557 --> 30:15.752
_

30:18.453 --> 30:19.792
_

30:21.775 --> 30:23.042
(Chattering)

30:30.643 --> 30:32.344
_

30:32.545 --> 30:35.393
_

30:35.594 --> 30:39.100
_

30:40.801 --> 30:46.657
_

30:48.058 --> 30:50.157
_

30:50.158 --> 30:52.422
_

30:55.000 --> 30:58.412
_

30:58.713 --> 31:01.613
_

31:01.614 --> 31:03.796
_

31:22.870 --> 31:23.903
I'm glad you called me.

31:26.874 --> 31:27.840
How are you?

31:30.778 --> 31:32.011
I wanted you to hear it from me.

31:33.747 --> 31:36.616
I'm gonna talk to the university
investigator about what happened.

31:36.650 --> 31:38.551
What? Why?

31:38.585 --> 31:39.719
You said you weren't going to.

31:39.753 --> 31:41.654
This thing is getting out of control.

31:41.689 --> 31:42.855
Have you been reading the stuff online?

31:42.890 --> 31:44.590
Yeah.

31:44.625 --> 31:45.825
You're a skank, and I'm a predator.

31:47.428 --> 31:48.661
What are you gonna tell
the investigator lady?

31:48.696 --> 31:50.596
I don't know exactly.

31:50.631 --> 31:52.565
I told her it was consensual.

31:52.599 --> 31:54.701
And it's my word against yours, so
if you say something different...

31:54.735 --> 31:57.236
- Tank!
- I'm gonna get kicked out of school.

31:57.271 --> 31:58.304
Do you understand that?

31:58.339 --> 32:00.306
I am not doing this to get you kicked out.

32:00.341 --> 32:02.342
- But that's what will happen.
- This isn't just about you.

32:02.376 --> 32:05.345
I know. I'm sorry, okay? It's just...

32:05.379 --> 32:08.081
this will follow me forever.

32:08.115 --> 32:09.282
It will ruin my life.

32:09.316 --> 32:10.983
Do you think I deserve that?

32:11.018 --> 32:12.197
Did I deserve having something done to me

32:12.198 --> 32:13.927
when I was too drunk
to give you permission?

32:14.021 --> 32:15.955
I didn't know it was
without your permission.

32:15.989 --> 32:17.290
Somewhere in your mind,

32:17.324 --> 32:19.359
did some part of you know that
what you were doing was wrong?

32:19.393 --> 32:20.893
I was drunk too!

32:20.928 --> 32:23.029
But did you have a feeling that
you were doing something wrong?

32:23.063 --> 32:24.097
I don't know.

32:28.869 --> 32:29.902
I don't know.

32:33.714 --> 32:35.615
(Scoffs) Look, you know me, Bay.

32:35.649 --> 32:38.418
Even before we dated, we were friends,

32:38.452 --> 32:39.786
and I've always cared so much about you.

32:41.388 --> 32:42.822
If that means anything to you at all,

32:42.856 --> 32:45.358
please, please don't do that interview.

32:51.059 --> 32:54.510
_

32:54.511 --> 32:55.945
_

32:59.600 --> 33:02.990
_

33:03.191 --> 33:07.141
_

33:07.342 --> 33:12.322
_

33:12.623 --> 33:15.198
_

33:15.599 --> 33:18.977
_

33:22.078 --> 33:27.032
_

33:27.033 --> 33:29.311
_

33:33.212 --> 33:37.766
_

33:37.967 --> 33:40.221
_

33:40.222 --> 33:44.004
_

33:44.005 --> 33:46.485
_

33:46.486 --> 33:49.655
_

33:58.656 --> 34:02.074
_

34:02.075 --> 34:06.455
_

34:07.356 --> 34:11.625
_

34:15.416 --> 34:16.649
(Knocking)

34:20.387 --> 34:21.454
Hi.

34:21.487 --> 34:22.522
Come in.

34:22.556 --> 34:23.523
Will there be more yelling?

34:31.565 --> 34:33.232
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

34:35.101 --> 34:36.436
My sister knows you
were just doing your job.

34:38.505 --> 34:41.139
I may have let my sense of
duty get the better of me.

34:42.141 --> 34:43.242
How so?

34:43.277 --> 34:45.378
Well, this happens to so many girls,

34:45.411 --> 34:47.347
and it makes me so angry.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.149
I just wanted somebody
to do something about it.

34:52.186 --> 34:54.053
But I should have told
you I was gonna report it.

34:55.856 --> 34:56.989
(Sighs)

34:58.225 --> 34:59.826
What a bloody mess.

35:02.196 --> 35:03.763
Have I blown it with your family?

35:04.765 --> 35:05.898
What do you mean?

35:05.933 --> 35:08.101
Well, do they blame me for
putting Bay through all this?

35:08.135 --> 35:09.769
I don't think so.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.871
Well, I wouldn't want them to resent me.

35:16.643 --> 35:17.744
I won't let that happen.

35:30.691 --> 35:31.724
John: Bay.

35:35.462 --> 35:36.562
You don't have to avoid me.

35:38.432 --> 35:40.299
I'm guessing mom told you.

35:40.334 --> 35:43.403
Whatever you're thinking,
I've probably already heard it.

35:43.437 --> 35:44.704
People are calling me all sorts of names

35:44.738 --> 35:46.606
and saying really terrible things about me.

35:48.642 --> 35:50.443
Is that what you think I would do?

35:52.479 --> 35:53.479
Look at me.

35:56.617 --> 35:59.152
Those people don't know what happened.

36:01.155 --> 36:02.255
I don't need to know either...

36:03.290 --> 36:04.490
unless you want me to.

36:07.060 --> 36:08.227
But you know what?

36:09.296 --> 36:10.296
I love you.

36:12.232 --> 36:13.299
The same as always.

36:19.039 --> 36:20.907
(Sobbing)

36:41.695 --> 36:42.895
Are you all right?

36:42.930 --> 36:44.997
It's gonna be fine.

36:45.032 --> 36:46.999
It's not a test.

36:47.034 --> 36:49.535
Go slow. Tell the truth.

36:52.606 --> 36:54.674
You don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

36:56.477 --> 36:58.711
And if you're not ready, we
can come back at another time.

37:01.482 --> 37:02.482
You wanna go home?

37:05.419 --> 37:06.419
(Door opens)

37:07.454 --> 37:08.855
Hi, Bay.

37:08.889 --> 37:12.325
I'm Eve Porter, the title IX
coordinator. Would you like to come in?

37:30.543 --> 37:32.424
I thought talking about this would..

37:33.057 --> 37:37.060
stop people from telling
me what to do, or...

37:37.095 --> 37:38.295
how to feel.

37:40.064 --> 37:42.299
But now I don't care what
anyone says. I just...

37:44.035 --> 37:46.270
I want to tell the truth.

37:48.306 --> 37:50.340
What is the truth, in your mind?

37:52.277 --> 37:54.278
The truth is...

37:54.312 --> 37:56.980
I made some bad choices.

37:58.283 --> 38:01.051
I drank too much. I said some
things that I shouldn't have said.

38:03.054 --> 38:04.855
I didn't look out for myself.

38:04.889 --> 38:07.057
You make it sound like you
were in that room alone.

38:07.091 --> 38:08.959
No, um...

38:10.094 --> 38:12.195
Tank was there too, and, uh...

38:14.132 --> 38:17.701
he also made some bad choices.

38:17.915 --> 38:20.283
Really bad choices.

38:20.318 --> 38:24.254
But what I'm saying is there's
enough blame to go around.

38:24.288 --> 38:27.780
You can't just hang one guy for it.

38:27.791 --> 38:30.393
We're not looking to hang anyone.

38:31.228 --> 38:33.129
That's not what this process is about.

38:34.165 --> 38:38.201
You're looking to pin
responsibility on somebody,

38:38.235 --> 38:39.335
but it's messy.

38:39.370 --> 38:41.337
Tank...

38:41.372 --> 38:42.405
is a good guy...

38:44.475 --> 38:47.410
and he would never do anything
to intentionally hurt me.

38:51.115 --> 38:53.216
But I do think that...

38:53.250 --> 38:54.350
Well...

38:56.020 --> 38:58.087
well, in this instance...

38:58.122 --> 38:59.155
He, um...

39:00.324 --> 39:01.357
Eve: Yes?

39:05.362 --> 39:07.096
I think what he did was wrong.

39:07.131 --> 39:09.032
What was wrong?

39:09.066 --> 39:10.099
We drank too much.

39:10.134 --> 39:11.968
I was a part of that.

39:13.170 --> 39:15.004
But in...

39:15.039 --> 39:16.072
in looking back...

39:18.842 --> 39:20.076
he should have walked away.

39:20.110 --> 39:22.078
Us sleeping together
should have never happened.

39:23.914 --> 39:25.782
I want to make sure I understand.

39:25.816 --> 39:29.919
Are you saying that you
regret having sex with Tank,

39:29.954 --> 39:31.721
or that it was not consensual?

39:33.123 --> 39:35.758
I'm saying something happened and...

39:38.128 --> 39:39.796
I wasn't okay with it.

39:43.701 --> 39:46.769
But we've both already suffered enough.

39:46.804 --> 39:49.105
- How so?
- Gossip, the humiliation,

39:49.139 --> 39:50.974
coming here.

39:55.012 --> 39:56.879
We've been through enough.

39:58.082 --> 39:59.949
Please don't put us through any more.

40:03.988 --> 40:06.623
I know this was hard for you.

40:06.657 --> 40:07.757
Thanks for coming in.

40:17.935 --> 40:19.636
(Phone vibrating)

40:33.751 --> 40:34.817
What happened?

40:36.687 --> 40:37.887
He got expelled.

40:37.921 --> 40:39.856
I... I can't believe it.

40:39.890 --> 40:41.724
This is exactly what he was afraid of.

40:41.759 --> 40:43.660
You can't control that.

40:43.694 --> 40:45.862
I told that lady how confusing it was,

40:45.896 --> 40:48.464
