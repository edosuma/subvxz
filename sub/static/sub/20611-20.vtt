[dramatic music]

00:04.505 --> 00:08.609
*

00:08.642 --> 00:10.644
- My name is Mark Steel Knapp.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.214
With my middle name Steel,

00:13.247 --> 00:15.449
to me it means
I'm a steel knife-maker.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.718
So I couldn't help but be that.

00:17.751 --> 00:22.256
And as far as my last name goes,
I'm pretty good at napping, too.

00:22.290 --> 00:25.259
- My name's Dan Roplad.
I just love making knives.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.295
My first memory,
I was a little baby

00:27.328 --> 00:30.364
and I was given
a plastic serrated knife

00:30.398 --> 00:32.133
and I cut myself with it

00:32.166 --> 00:33.667
and I was indignant
that the adults

00:33.701 --> 00:36.270
had given me something
that could hurt me.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.439
But for some reason--
maybe it's that--

00:38.472 --> 00:39.807
I always go back
to making knives.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.675
- My name's Christopher Price.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.777
I am fascinated
by historical bladesmithing

00:43.811 --> 00:47.381
because it acts as
a portal back in time.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.683
And there's a little bit of
magic in it that I just love.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.620
- I am Holden Mystery. I'm 18.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.588
Nowadays it seems like

00:54.622 --> 00:55.823
everybody's got to go
to college,

00:55.856 --> 00:57.691
be a doctor or whatever.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.161
But I'm not doing
the conventional thing.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.762
I don't try to be
different on purpose.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.864
It's just who I am.
I can't help it.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.400
I just can't help
but make blades.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.435
*

01:07.468 --> 01:08.536
- Bladesmiths,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.504
welcome to the Forge.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.406
You're here for three rounds
of edged weapon making

01:12.440 --> 01:13.841
competition designed to test

01:13.874 --> 01:15.876
every aspect
of your capabilities.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.112
At the end of each round,
you'll be presenting your work

01:18.146 --> 01:20.214
to our panel of expert judges.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.184
They decide which of you will be
the "Forged in Fire" Champion

01:23.217 --> 01:26.187
who also leaves here
with that check for $10,000.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.521
Let's go ahead
and meet them now.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.658
ABS master smith,
J. Neilson.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.494
Historic weapons recreation
specialist, David Baker.

01:33.527 --> 01:37.365
Edged weapon specialist,
Doug Marcaida.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.167
Today, we won't be providing you

01:39.200 --> 01:41.602
with any pristine
high-carbon steel.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.837
We like to throw a monkey wrench
into the works.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.439
Quite literally.

01:45.473 --> 01:49.443
*

01:49.477 --> 01:51.812
You will be forging
signature blades

01:51.845 --> 01:53.381
in your signature style

01:53.414 --> 01:55.249
from these pipe wrenches.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.850
- Wrenches.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.753
What the hell am I gonna do
with those?

01:59.787 --> 02:03.891
- In an order chosen at random,
you will select your wrench.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.427
Mark, you're up first.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.530
- I want to make sure
that I have enough material

02:09.563 --> 02:11.899
to make the knife
that I want to make.

02:11.932 --> 02:15.569
So I choose the biggest
wrench in the pile.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.171
- Was there a bigger one up here

02:17.205 --> 02:18.539
that you
could have chosen, Mark?

02:18.572 --> 02:19.940
- I picked the biggest one.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.742
- All right. Holden,

02:21.775 --> 02:24.945
please move forward
and select your steel.

02:24.978 --> 02:29.450
- Big ones, some little ones,
all kinds of pipe wrenches.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.884
I don't want anything so big

02:30.918 --> 02:32.753
that I have to hold it
in the forge

02:32.786 --> 02:34.555
'cause I'm pretty lazy.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.624
So that's why I picked
the one I did.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.960
- Daniel, you're up.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.530
- I have no idea what steel
is in these wrenches.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.598
The handle's probably not good.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.934
The jaws probably, but--

02:46.967 --> 02:49.370
[poofs air]
I don't know.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.340
- Chris, please
select your steel.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.941
- I'm the last one to pick,

02:53.974 --> 02:56.644
so I look for the one
that's got the most jaw

02:56.677 --> 02:58.379
'cause I don't want to use
the handle.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.914
It's too hard of a shape
to forge out.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.816
- Keep in mind
that in the second round

03:02.850 --> 03:04.418
you'll be putting handles
on those blades

03:04.452 --> 03:06.554
to turn them into
fully-functional weapons

03:06.587 --> 03:08.689
that will be tested for strength
and durability

03:08.722 --> 03:10.958
hammering through a copper pipe

03:10.991 --> 03:14.262
and for edge retention
in a rope slice.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.464
You will have 10 minutes
to work on your designs.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.300
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.670
Your 10-minute design window
starts... now.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.673
[upbeat rock music]

03:25.706 --> 03:27.675
*

03:27.708 --> 03:29.577
- I'm making a broken back seax

03:29.610 --> 03:32.746
because it's a very
versatile tool.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.383
The last year has been
really challenging.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.652
My wife passed away from
a long fight with breast cancer

03:38.686 --> 03:41.322
and it's been hard
to get myself out of my shell.

03:41.355 --> 03:44.024
But one of the things
my wife made clear

03:44.057 --> 03:45.893
was that we should move on.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.629
And so this is part of that
for me.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.398
I don't know if she's
looking down on me,

03:50.431 --> 03:54.802
but I hope what I'm doing
honors her memory.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.306
- I'm gonna make a cross between
a camp knife and a bowie.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.007
I think it'll work really well
for the test.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.609
It's gonna be pretty beefy
on the back,

04:01.642 --> 04:03.010
so it'll support that edge,

04:03.043 --> 04:05.045
and yet still be thin enough

04:05.078 --> 04:06.980
so that it will be able
to slice through the rope.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.916
I don't know if I'll be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.985
I hope so. I've got the skills.
I got the potential.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.923
I'm awesome. [laughs]

04:15.956 --> 04:19.293
- I'm making a bolo because
it has a big belly to it.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.762
It will cut through
that copper pipe and that rope.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.065
Back home, there's a lot
of people rooting for me,

04:25.098 --> 04:26.967
you know, that's great.
That's awesome.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.638
'Cause, you know, whoo!
[laughs]

04:30.671 --> 04:31.905
*

04:31.939 --> 04:33.407
- The style of my blade

04:33.441 --> 04:35.843
is just gonna be a big chopper.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.613
I think what drew me to this
competition is the challenge.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.715
Being taken out of my box

04:41.749 --> 04:43.684
and being challenged
to do things

04:43.717 --> 04:45.653
that I had never done before.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.555
I'm excited about it.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.458
- Bladesmiths, your design
period is now closed.

04:50.491 --> 04:55.563
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.666
Monkey wrenches, pipe wrenches,
whatever you want to call it,

04:58.699 --> 05:00.368
there's a lot of steel
there to work with.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.635
- I guess our guys are gonna be

05:01.669 --> 05:03.036
monkeying around
for a while, huh?

05:03.070 --> 05:04.972
- Here we go. Here we go.
- [laughing]

05:05.005 --> 05:08.008
- I have no ididwhat.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.877
I'm assuming the jaws
are the best,

05:09.910 --> 05:12.346
but I'm gonna do a spark test.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.948
If you get a complex burst
of sparks coming out of them,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.418
then it's a high-carbon steel.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.520
- The jaws are kicking off
a crazy amount of sparks.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.722
- Yep.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.491
- The jaws of the wrenches
has to be the best steel,

05:23.524 --> 05:24.992
so that's definitely
what I'm gonna have to use.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.027
My first plan of attack
is don't panic.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.929
[bleep].

05:28.962 --> 05:30.764
If something happens,
I say a few choice words

05:30.798 --> 05:32.633
and then I just move right on.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.067
[bleep].

05:34.101 --> 05:36.136
*

05:36.169 --> 05:39.106
- I know right away
that I'm going to use a jaw.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.509
- I like Mark's idea of grabbing
the big pipe wrench,

05:41.542 --> 05:44.378
take the top of the jaw off,
and forge a blade out of that.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.680
- The upper jaw was here.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.749
So this is the threaded
shaft of it.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.784
We're not sure
what steel this is.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.120
Now I have a straight piece.

05:53.153 --> 05:56.424
Gonna start drawing it out
as quickly as I can.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.526
*

05:58.559 --> 06:00.761
- I just saw Chris put stockings
on his arms.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.731
- They're to keep from burning
his forearms.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.399
- Yeah.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.167
- I decide to go
with the upper jaw,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.869
and the first thing I have
to get rid of are the teeth.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.771
They're just nothing
but trouble.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.573
- Well, he won't have to worry
about the cold shuts

06:12.606 --> 06:14.675
building up between those teeth.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.845
- I know this competition
can be really challenging,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.648
but one of the things
that keeps me centered

06:20.681 --> 06:23.451
is my practice of Zen Buddhism.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.654
I have the ability
to always take myself

06:26.687 --> 06:28.822
out of an extreme position

06:28.856 --> 06:31.091
and focus on
what's in front of me,

06:31.124 --> 06:33.627
and I think that'll help me
in this competition.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.896
*

06:35.929 --> 06:39.433
- Holden has an interesting
thing going on with his shell

06:39.467 --> 06:41.034
and pouch or--

06:41.068 --> 06:42.836
- I didn't want to comment on it

06:42.870 --> 06:45.806
just in case he's a wizard
of some kind.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.609
- I got Barbie parts.
I got a shell.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.478
And I got a coyote tail.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.814
My apron was one
of those cheap aprons,

06:53.847 --> 06:55.483
but pieces kept falling off it.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.651
So I just kept
riveting new pieces on.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.520
I love my apron.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.722
It's who I am.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.924
I am going to use the handle

07:03.957 --> 07:07.227
'cause that's already
pretty straight and mostly flat.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.897
- Holden's the only one
that's using the handle portion

07:09.930 --> 07:11.965
of the monkey wrench
and that's concerning.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.967
Those handles are
an I-beam construction,

07:14.001 --> 07:16.103
so it's really easy
to forge in cold shuts

07:16.136 --> 07:18.238
when you've got to
flatten that out.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.041
- As he smashes it down,
it'll roll in on itself.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.810
- Right.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.712
- Creating bad pockets
right in there.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.847
- I got to get it done quickly
without cold shuts,

07:26.880 --> 07:28.716
and that's turning out
to be a little difficult.

07:28.749 --> 07:32.653
- You have only two hours
remaining to finish your work.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.822
- Only?

07:34.855 --> 07:37.024
- Daniel's blade
is coming along nice.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.759
- I'm kind of in the zone

07:38.792 --> 07:40.193
of just really focusing on me

07:40.227 --> 07:42.696
and the time
and what I need to do.

07:42.730 --> 07:46.800
I start going with a flat grind,
which is not my easiest grind.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.669
Presently I'm just getting
back into knife making.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.604
I stopped working with knives

07:50.638 --> 07:53.607
and started doing artwork
for a number of years.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.176
I'm most nervous of making
a fool of myself.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.746
One thing I don't want is
to go out in the first round.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.248
But we'll see.
[chuckles]

08:01.281 --> 08:03.551
*

08:03.584 --> 08:05.619
- When I work with a mystery
metal that I don't know

08:05.653 --> 08:07.821
what its heat treatment schedule
was like,

08:07.855 --> 08:10.223
you have to experiment
a little bit.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.292
Looking at the broken
end of this

08:12.325 --> 08:15.596
and I'm looking for
how big the structure inside is.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.897
- Chris did what I've been
waiting four seasons

08:16.930 --> 08:18.899
for somebody to do.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.569
He took recycled material,
heated it, quenched it,

08:21.602 --> 08:23.671
and snapped it
to see the grain structure.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.574
That's gonna tell him how
he should heat-treat the blade.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.742
That is a very, very smart move.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.544
- Now I know how hot
it's got to get,

08:30.578 --> 08:32.546
how many times I've got to
thermally cycle it

08:32.580 --> 08:35.015
to get it to work,
and what its durability is.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.619
And that's
really valuable information.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.688
- I have forged
the blade to shape.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.255
- Mark is a machine.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.291
That guy is just knocking it
out of the park.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.660
- I'm just checking
for any cracks.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.195
making sure I've got
everything centered.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.831
So far, so good.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.199
It's time to move on
to the normalizing.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.901
*

08:53.934 --> 08:56.003
I see that the blade is warping.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.337
[bleep].

08:57.370 --> 08:59.172
- It worries me if Mark is

08:59.206 --> 09:01.208
getting bends in his blade now

09:01.241 --> 09:02.910
and he hasn't quenched yet.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.945
That doesn't bode well
for the quench.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.115
- Sometimes this competition
comes down to

09:08.148 --> 09:11.284
a warped blade
over an unwarped blade,

09:11.318 --> 09:14.922
and sometime it's the warped
blade that has to go home.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.724
I'm gonna do everything I can

09:16.757 --> 09:18.859
to straighten the blade
before I quench.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.293
*

09:20.327 --> 09:23.096
- I'm not doing so well.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.065
I'm seeing a lot of cold shuts.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.768
This is intense.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.937
I start flattening it out.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.073
- It looks like he's trying
to force those lips down.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.742
- I have a feeling
that they're folding over.

09:34.775 --> 09:39.179
- Yeah.
- They're creating some spots.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.881
- I see a crack.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.116
Actually, more than one crack.

09:43.150 --> 09:46.620
- That handle section of steel
is a lost cause right now.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.355
- I continue with
this cracked blade

09:48.388 --> 09:51.124
that I know for a fact
will just shatter in heat-treat.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.226
I'll get disqualified.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.263
Some say it's insane to do
things more than once, but...

09:58.298 --> 10:00.233
I got to start again.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.836
- With a hour left,
he's starting a whole new blade.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.805
He's made a decision

10:04.838 --> 10:07.875
to go with the jaws
of the pipe wrench.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.342
- That's a smart choice.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.244
- But he needs to kick it
into high gear

10:11.278 --> 10:14.748
because these other smiths
are not amateurs.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.951
- In my mind, I got to do this
in half the amount of time

10:17.985 --> 10:19.820
that I'm supposed to,
and already

10:19.853 --> 10:21.755
the three hours was a crunch.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.390
It's that nagging in the back
of your head like,

10:23.423 --> 10:24.992
"You got to get done now,
now, now, now, now."

10:25.025 --> 10:27.227
*

10:27.260 --> 10:28.996
- I'm feeling pretty good.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.999
I got my pipe wrench
forged out into a blade.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.235
But until it's been properly
hardened, it's not a knife.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.436
- Look at that. Look at that.
Oh, yeah.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.404
- There he goes. That's nice.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.239
- That's beautiful.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.241
- Now the big concern's
gonna be a warp.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.743
*

10:42.776 --> 10:45.312
- Moment of truth.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.948
I think it'll do.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.784
- I straightened the warp
from the normalizing.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.753
I'm in a good place.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.288
Now, I'm gonna quench
and cross my fingers

10:55.322 --> 10:57.424
and hopefully it'll
come out straight.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.326
*

10:59.359 --> 11:01.862
Some of the mistakes
that bladesmiths make

11:01.895 --> 11:06.399
is they bring the blade out
of the quench oil too soon.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.937
I like to take my time.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.739
It comes out straight.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.742
Yeah.

11:14.775 --> 11:18.378
*

11:18.411 --> 11:20.013
- There it is, Daniel.
Right there.

11:20.047 --> 11:23.316
*

11:23.350 --> 11:25.318
- Ugh, I can't believe it.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.921
It warps like you
wouldn't believe.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.223
It's got a big kink in it.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.425
This is where unknown steel
bites you in the butt.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.361
My choice is to go back in again

11:34.394 --> 11:37.898
or just let it go.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.332
I'm just afraid of going back

11:39.366 --> 11:41.034
through another heat-treat
process.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.370
- So Daniel, with a bent blade,

11:43.403 --> 11:47.140
has laid his blade on the anvil
as if he's done.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.809
- Well, there's still
more things to do.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.144
Namely, he could soften
that spine up.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.313
- And now's the time to do it
while you have the forge.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.447
- Oh, yeah.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.216
*

11:56.249 --> 11:58.451
- Holden's kind of
getting it together.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.088
- I wish I would have started
with the jaw

12:01.121 --> 12:03.156
like everyone else.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.358
I get nervous when I do
the heat-treat,

12:05.392 --> 12:08.195
but I get nervous all the time
over stupid stuff.

12:08.228 --> 12:12.866
It's like spilled milk
or hairy lemons.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.367
- Guy worked his ass off.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.003
Give him credit.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.872
- Ten, nine, eight,

12:18.906 --> 12:21.809
seven, six, five,

12:21.842 --> 12:26.213
four, three, two, one.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.215
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.984
Drop your tools.
This round is over.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.886
- When I see everyone else's
blades, I'm like, "Man.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.888
Those are looking pretty nice."

12:34.922 --> 12:39.993
But they didn't have to forge
two times like I did.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.494
So I think I did okay.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.363
*

12:43.396 --> 12:45.165
- Bladesmiths, over the last
three hours,

12:45.198 --> 12:46.800
you took pipe wrenches
and turned them into

12:46.834 --> 12:49.169
signature blades
in your signature style.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.172
Now it's time for the judges
to take a closer look.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.074
Mark, you're up first.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.143
*

12:56.176 --> 12:58.846
- First off,
just love the shape. Very nice.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.547
Your plunge grinds
are beautiful.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.949
It's got a great feel to it.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.416
There's a lot of blade here

13:03.450 --> 13:05.118
but there's not a lot
of weight here,

13:05.152 --> 13:07.520
which is nice to see.
Very well done.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.157
- Thank you.
- Daniel, you're up.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.092
*

13:12.125 --> 13:13.994
- Daniel, I love
the shape of this,

13:14.027 --> 13:16.163
and I really enjoyed
watching you forge it,

13:16.196 --> 13:18.966
but you picked up
a warp, though.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.235
I mean, it's pretty significant.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.138
Why didn't you do anything else
that last ten minutes or so?

13:25.172 --> 13:27.140
- I was just afraid it would
just get worse.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.009
- Okay.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.612
- It's not just a warp.
It's kind of an S.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.182
When you get those it's so hard
to come around them.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.950
That's a concern.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.585
- Chris, your turn.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.121
*

13:41.154 --> 13:43.390
- Chris, solid piece.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.859
The way you tapered it from
the plunge grind to the tip,

13:45.893 --> 13:48.495
also from the spine to the edge.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.264
I'll go as far as saying
it's the "seax-iest" seax

13:51.298 --> 13:54.101
I've ever seen turned in.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.169
- Holden, you're up.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.005
*

13:58.038 --> 13:59.572
- Chasing a bad choice

13:59.606 --> 14:01.608
is something
we've watched smiths do

14:01.641 --> 14:03.643
on this show again
and again and again,

14:03.676 --> 14:06.646
and having the smarts
to change up your plan

14:06.679 --> 14:08.648
is a good thing to do.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.484
- You do have a little bit of
a warp but it's not bad.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.888
There's enough material here
to correct that, I think.

14:14.922 --> 14:15.889
- All right, gentlemen,
the judges have

14:15.923 --> 14:17.657
a final decision to make,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.459
so I'm gonna ask you to leave
your blades on this table

14:19.492 --> 14:22.229
and step off the Forge floor.

14:22.262 --> 14:27.935
*

14:27.968 --> 14:30.203
- That was interesting.
- Yeah.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.205
- All right, judges,
our bladesmiths have completed

14:32.239 --> 14:34.507
their knives, now it's time
to take a closer look.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.309
Let's start with Chris.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.213
- Aside from Chris giving us
a very clean blade,

14:40.247 --> 14:42.215
I love the smart choices
he made.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.351
Beautiful grinds

14:44.384 --> 14:46.219
and it's nice and straight.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.255
- All right, let's go ahead
and take a look

14:48.288 --> 14:50.023
at Mark's work.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.358
*

14:51.391 --> 14:53.426
- Basic, well-executed.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.163
Shows advanced precision.
That's what I like about it.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.131
It looks like it was done
by a machine.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.300
Well-executed.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.003
- All right, let's move on to
Holden's blade on the end there.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.972
- I wasn't sure you had
a chance to finish.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.140
- Yeah, I didn't, either,
but I did.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.009
*

15:09.042 --> 15:10.710
- There's a lot of work
still to do here.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.513
You can see where
those teeth have left

15:13.546 --> 15:15.115
those small little lines.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.616
They're not cracks.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.251
I'd love to see him
grind those out

15:18.285 --> 15:20.320
'cause those are
potential fracture points.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.688
- Holden did a nice piece here.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.957
You know, he never quit.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.458
It's got a little bit
of a warp in it

15:25.492 --> 15:27.327
but it's within grinder range.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.629
That's a solid foundation.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.132
- Let's move on
to Daniel's blade.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.101
*

15:34.134 --> 15:36.069
- I liked what Daniel was doing.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.105
I liked watching him forge
this blade out.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.273
It's got a great profile.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.143
But then you turn
the blade this way

15:43.176 --> 15:46.046
and you got not one warp
but you got two.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.115
It's curving to the left

15:48.148 --> 15:49.983
and then back to the right
at the tip.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.418
We got an S here.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.353
It's like an eel
going through the water.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.056
- Basically, this knife
needs to be reheated--

15:56.089 --> 15:58.325
not just on the spine--
to be straightened.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.361
It needs to be
reheated completely.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.762
- Doug, have you made
your final decision?

16:02.795 --> 16:03.763
- Yes, I have.
- Dave?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.598
- Yep.
- J.?

16:05.632 --> 16:06.766
- Absolutely.
- Let's go tell our smiths.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.202
*

16:09.236 --> 16:12.272
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation

16:12.305 --> 16:14.441
and they've made
a final decision.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.344
The bladesmith leaving
the Forge is...

16:17.377 --> 16:19.412
*

16:19.446 --> 16:21.281
Daniel.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.383
Your blade did not make the cut.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.318
- Daniel, it was a true pleasure
watching you

16:25.352 --> 16:26.719
forge that blade to shape.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.056
You got skills
in there like crazy.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.623
But when it came to the quench,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.292
you pulled such a warp
into that blade

16:32.325 --> 16:34.527
and a twist on top of it

16:34.561 --> 16:37.064
and it was so much more extreme
than any of the other blades,

16:37.097 --> 16:39.199
and that's why we have
to let you go.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.468
- Daniel,
please surrender your blade.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.803
*

16:43.836 --> 16:46.273
- When I heard my name my heart
just dropped into my stomach,

16:46.306 --> 16:48.108
but I have to agree
with the judges' decision.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.410
It was a really bad warp
and I had time to fix it,

16:50.443 --> 16:52.579
which I should have.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.048
- You take it easy.
- There's absolutely no shame

16:55.082 --> 16:57.317
in losing this competition.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.252
You learn from failure.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.187
You have to fail in life
to move forward--

17:00.220 --> 17:01.388
to learn.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.655
*

17:02.689 --> 17:04.257
- Congratulations, bladesmiths.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.193
You've made it into
the second round.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.161
Now that your blades
have been tempered,

17:08.195 --> 17:09.496
it's time to turn them
into fully-functional weapons

17:09.529 --> 17:11.631
by attaching handles to them.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.567
However,
you must include at least

17:14.601 --> 17:16.436
two different types
of handle material

17:16.469 --> 17:18.705
into your handle's
overall construction.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.740
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.809
When the time runs out,

17:22.842 --> 17:25.378
your weapons will be tested
for strength and durability

17:25.412 --> 17:27.747
batonning through a copper pipe

17:27.780 --> 17:31.251
and for edge retention
in a rope slice.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.652
Good luck, bladesmiths.

17:32.685 --> 17:36.389
Your three hours starts... now.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.858
- Off to the pantry they go.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.293
- I'm feeling pretty good about

17:40.327 --> 17:42.295
going into the fit and finish.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.365
My niche in the industry
is elaborate handles.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.267
Maybe I can show a little bit
of what I can do.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.237
Gonna put this white Micarta
on both ends

17:50.270 --> 17:54.341
and then I'm going to put
the cocobolo in the middle.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.410
- It'd be nice to have a light
and dark contrast on a knife.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.580
- I usually take quite a bit
of time to make my handles.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.483
Having to do it in three hours
is gonna be a push.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.518
*

18:05.552 --> 18:09.156
- Chris is set up the best here.
His blade is finished.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.792
- Three hours to do a handle.
It should be something gorgeous.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.761
- For my handle,
I take five different things

18:14.794 --> 18:16.629
from the pantry to build it.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.498
White resin, black resin,

18:18.531 --> 18:21.234
Micarta, copper, and brass.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.470
I feel like going
above and beyond.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.272
I want to win. [laughs]

18:25.305 --> 18:27.407
So it's worth it to me.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.709
*

18:29.742 --> 18:33.380
- I look over at Chris' blade
and it is fantastic.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.482
But I'm not Chris.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.616
I'm Holden.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.451
*

18:38.485 --> 18:40.153
I got a lot of grinding
I need to do

18:40.187 --> 18:42.455
to try and get that warp
out of my blade.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.657
But I can get a handle done
very quickly.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.560
So I'm not worried.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.862
- You know, Holden's got a much
better profile on that edge.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.664
He's knocked that bump
on the front that he had.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.367
- Yep.
- One hour has elapsed.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.669
You have two hours remaining
to finish your work.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.771
*

18:58.805 --> 19:01.208
- I'm taking a little bit
more time on the handle material

19:01.241 --> 19:02.742
than I had hoped.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.345
This cocobolo
doesn't want to cut.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.747
It's a very sticky material.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.349
The drill bit gets heated up,

19:09.382 --> 19:11.918
things start to smoke
and it burns.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.254
And I'm getting frustrated.
[bleep].

19:14.287 --> 19:16.256
*

19:16.289 --> 19:18.491
- Mark's still drilling
through that wood.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.327
- It's gumming up the drill bit.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.395
You got to stop, clean it out.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.597
- It's taking me a lot longer
to get this out

19:24.631 --> 19:27.900
because it just kind of smears
like peanut butter in there.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.237
It's a little bit tight on time.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.771
I'm feeling a little bit
more pressure

19:31.804 --> 19:33.773
than I've felt
the whole process so far.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.376
*

19:36.409 --> 19:38.345
- I fixed all the problems
I needed to do.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.414
Now all I need to do
is my handle.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.383
I don't want to use
any natural materials.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.218
I don't want anything to crack.

19:45.252 --> 19:48.421
So I grab carbon fiber
for the guard

19:48.455 --> 19:52.559
and I find resin pine cone
for the handle.

19:52.592 --> 19:55.828
My plan is to do
a three-part tang construction

19:55.862 --> 19:57.930
where I have a cutout
in the middle

19:57.964 --> 19:59.666
and two slabs on each side.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.768
I think it'll look really cool.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.237
*

20:04.271 --> 20:06.005
- It's time to put my handle
on my knife,

20:06.038 --> 20:07.740
but now that there's epoxy
in there,

20:07.774 --> 20:10.277
it doesn't quite want
to slide down very easy.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.011
- Uh-oh.
- Could be a problem.

20:12.044 --> 20:17.784
Oh, he's going to get a hammer.
That's not good.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.319
- My handle doesn't quite want
to slide down very easy.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.254
- Gentle, gentle, gentle.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.723
- This is how handle material
cracks right here,

20:23.756 --> 20:25.558
ladies and gentlemen.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.460
- I just need to get
this thing on.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.596
But I need to be really gentle

20:29.629 --> 20:31.698
or else I'm screwed.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.700
- The gap is closing.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.337
*

20:37.370 --> 20:38.805
- All right.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.740
- Cool.
- Oh, thank goodness.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.644
- You have just one hour
remaining to finish your work.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.279
- Mark's handle is
looking beautiful.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.915
- The handle may not be
quite polished

20:48.948 --> 20:51.484
the way I want it to be,

20:51.518 --> 20:53.820
but it's good enough
to get a edge on there.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.356
It's the highest priority
at this point.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.924
Cut myself.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.859
- Mark has cut himself
over there.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.762
You can see the blood
on the top of his left hand.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.297
- Things are getting hectic.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.998
Thank you, man.
- No problem.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.401
- Every knife-maker puts
a little bit of blood,

21:08.435 --> 21:10.670
sweat, and tears in every knife
that he makes,

21:10.703 --> 21:12.905
and that one was
a pretty good one.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.007
*

21:15.041 --> 21:16.909
- Feeling pretty damn good.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.679
All I got to do
is slap everything together

21:19.712 --> 21:22.715
and glue the [bleep] out of it.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.683
[bleep].

21:23.716 --> 21:25.518
*

21:25.552 --> 21:28.388
- It appears that Holden
drilled his pinholes

21:28.421 --> 21:29.889
and set them on his tang,

21:29.922 --> 21:32.359
but it looks like
he put one on upside-down

21:32.392 --> 21:34.994
because they're sitting
like this on the tang.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.729
- My scales aren't even.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.501
I don't know how it happened.
Everything was lined up.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.670
- They're offset by almost
a half inch.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.572
- Yeah, so I mean,
if he cuts those down

21:45.605 --> 21:48.441
evenly it's gonna be,
like, a 1-inch high handle.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.109
- Yeah.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.978
- Stuff like this happens
to me all the time.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.847
Don't know why.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.716
I don't want to move
these pieces at all

21:56.749 --> 21:59.419
'cause I don't have the time
to do it right now.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.888
- Here we go.
Grind it all out.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.756
- It's not gonna fall apart.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.526
It's just gonna be
a little weird in the hands,

22:06.559 --> 22:08.961
but it's better than no handle.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.030
*

22:11.063 --> 22:12.932
- Five minutes, bladesmiths.

22:12.965 --> 22:16.102
Five minutes remaining
in this round.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.070
Chris still hasn't peened
that tang over.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.707
He's not gonna do that, Dave?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.475
Right now,
all of that handle material

22:22.509 --> 22:24.076
is just held on with glue.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.878
- I look at the clock.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.080
I look at my blade
and I suddenly realize

22:28.114 --> 22:30.149
I haven't peened my tang.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.951
- There we go. There we go.
There we go.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.920
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

22:33.953 --> 22:34.987
Man, you talk about waiting
till the last minute

22:35.021 --> 22:36.423
do something like that.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.758
- I need a solid mechanical hold

22:38.791 --> 22:42.128
and I've got to get that done
in rapid fashion.

22:42.161 --> 22:46.065
*

22:46.098 --> 22:49.035
- Ten, nine, eight,

22:49.068 --> 22:51.971
seven, six, five,

22:52.004 --> 22:56.476
four, three, two, one.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.811
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.
Shut down your machines.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.847
This round is over.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.882
*

23:02.915 --> 23:04.984
- I was able to peen
the tang over,

23:05.017 --> 23:07.119
but just barely in time.

23:07.153 --> 23:12.559
Hopefully it will hold up
against the testing.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.694
- All right, gentlemen.
This is the strength test.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.763
To test the strength
and durability of your blades,

23:16.796 --> 23:20.800
I'm going to baton down
through these copper pipes.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.436
Three blows each blade.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.071
Mark, you're up first.
You ready for this?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.873
- Let's see it.
- Okay.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.875
*

23:28.908 --> 23:30.810
- Batonning is very hard
on knives,

23:30.843 --> 23:33.680
and there is a possibility
it could break.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.449
I'm just hoping for no failure.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.884
Yeah.

23:37.917 --> 23:44.857
*

23:47.059 --> 23:50.463
*

23:50.497 --> 23:54.667
- Mark, if it wasn't
for the copper on the edge here,

23:54.701 --> 23:56.869
I wouldn't know
where it hit the pipe.

23:56.903 --> 24:00.072
There's no chips.
No deformations.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.842
It didn't even lose
any of its sharpness.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.077
Nicely done.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.680
All right, Chris.
Your turn. You ready?

24:07.714 --> 24:09.816
*

24:09.849 --> 24:13.219
- I'm a little bit nervous
because I'm not sure

24:13.252 --> 24:16.055
my handle is secure
on the knife correctly.

24:18.725 --> 24:25.698
*

24:27.133 --> 24:30.970
*

24:31.003 --> 24:32.505
- Everything's still tight.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.974
Still feels fine in the hand.

24:35.007 --> 24:39.245
We've got some very,
very slight chipping

24:39.278 --> 24:41.581
and a little bit of a roll
on one side.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.817
It's not deep but it's there.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.587
All right, Holden, your turn.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.756
*

24:49.789 --> 24:52.091
- I was actually kind of
expecting, like, a police baton,

24:52.124 --> 24:53.960
not a full baseball bat.

24:53.993 --> 25:06.005
But, you know,
whatever works, David.

25:15.648 --> 25:20.587
*

25:20.620 --> 25:22.188
- Holden, first off,

25:22.221 --> 25:25.992
your blade--
a little teeny bit of roll.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.660
The problem is,

25:27.694 --> 25:29.596
you no longer have a handle.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.564
*

25:31.598 --> 25:35.301
It cracked the first time
on the first hit.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.604
On the third hit, though,

25:37.637 --> 25:40.673
that handle broken right
through the pine cone.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.975
And you can see where the frame

25:43.009 --> 25:46.045
is really the only thing
holding it together.

25:46.078 --> 25:49.616
And since there's no mechanical
connection from your frame

25:49.649 --> 25:51.317
to your actual scales,

25:51.350 --> 25:53.285
this is going to cut loose.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.087
- My handle cracked.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.189
I'm disappointed. This is over.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.358
I'm done.

25:59.391 --> 26:03.229
- Holden, your blade has
suffered a catastrophic failure

26:03.262 --> 26:05.264
and can no longer continue
to be tested.

26:05.297 --> 26:08.635
Therefore, it cannot
make the cut.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.903
I have to ask you
to please leave the Forge.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.805
- Okay.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.907
Catastrophic failure's
kind of a bummer.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.276
I should have taken the
extra time to correct my slabs.

26:17.309 --> 26:20.046
Kind of a dumb move
and I guess I paid for it.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.282
It is annoying, but, hey,
live and let learn.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.755
- Mark, Chris, congratulations.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.257
The strength of your weapons
has carried you

26:31.290 --> 26:33.159
into the final round
of this competition.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.927
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges

26:34.961 --> 26:37.296
to recreate an iconic weapon
from history.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.198
That weapon is...

26:39.231 --> 26:42.401
*

26:42.434 --> 26:43.803
The tabar-shishpar.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.873
*

26:46.906 --> 26:49.842
The tabar-shishpar
is an extremely rare weapon

26:49.876 --> 26:52.679
that was used by mounted
warriors in India, Pakistan,

26:52.712 --> 26:56.048
and Afghanistan
during the 1600s and 1700s.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.184
The combination of two
deadly weapons,

26:58.217 --> 27:00.352
the tabar's axe
was sharp and lethal

27:00.386 --> 27:03.189
while the shishpar's mace
was just as dangerous

27:03.222 --> 27:05.992
using blunt force
to take down opponents.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.695
The mace could also contain up
to eight flanges

27:08.728 --> 27:10.196
that were able
to penetrate shields

27:10.229 --> 27:12.031
and bash through armor,

27:12.064 --> 27:13.365
making this brutal weapon

27:13.399 --> 27:16.836
a force to be reckoned with.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.338
The tabar must include
a 4-inch blade,

27:19.371 --> 27:21.073
and the shishpar portion

27:21.107 --> 27:24.210
must include
at least five flanges.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.779
- Part axe, part mace thing.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.415
Hadn't heard that before.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.050
- You will have five days
at your home forge

27:31.083 --> 27:32.451
to complete this challenge.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.754
At the end of five days,
you will return

27:34.787 --> 27:37.056
and present your weapon
to our panel of expert judges.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.125
Only after they've
tested your weapaps

27:39.158 --> 27:41.961
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" Champion

27:41.994 --> 27:44.764
who also leaves here
with that check for $10,000.

27:44.797 --> 27:47.700
- I'm feeling pretty confident
I can make the thing.

27:47.734 --> 27:51.070
I've got the "Oxford Studies
in Islamic Art, Volume 15,"

27:51.103 --> 27:53.239
and I know there's one
of these in there.

27:53.272 --> 27:56.442
- Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

27:56.475 --> 27:57.409
- Good luck.

27:57.443 --> 28:00.947
*

28:00.980 --> 28:02.949
- It feels great to be home.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.451
I'm making a tabar-shishpar.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.988
I'm making everything 1/2-inch
bigger on every dimension

28:09.021 --> 28:12.458
so that if I have to grind back
I still make the minimums.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.293
I got a lot of metal to cut.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.063
144 pieces total.

28:17.096 --> 28:19.431
I'm making the weapon
out of Damascus

28:19.465 --> 28:21.968
because it could be the thing

28:22.001 --> 28:25.071
that tips the judges
in my favor.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.373
I'm making more Damascus
than I need

28:27.406 --> 28:29.241
in case something goes wrong
with one of them

28:29.275 --> 28:31.477
I don't have to start all over.

28:31.510 --> 28:36.448
The weapon was made
to smash armor and break skulls,

28:36.482 --> 28:40.052
so it needs to be strong enough
yet light enough

28:40.086 --> 28:44.156
to be an effective weapon.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.992
It came apart.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.260
I never saw that happen before.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.829
Now I've wasted a billet.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.098
There's no salvaging it.

28:52.131 --> 28:55.768
If I burn up some more steel,
I won't have enough.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.937
I've got to get it right
from here on out.

28:57.970 --> 29:01.007
*

29:01.040 --> 29:04.443
- I have to build
this tabar-shishpar.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.913
I have never made
a bludgeoning weapon.

29:06.946 --> 29:09.949
Today, I'm gonna work
on the shaft of this weapon.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.952
I have material, but I don't
think it's quite tough enough.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.021
So I'm getting another one
inside of it

29:15.054 --> 29:17.857
to make sure that it can stand
any challenge that they give me.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.458
It's a little bit heavier

29:19.491 --> 29:21.327
but I think the judges
are up to that challenge.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.162
*

29:23.195 --> 29:26.365
I've forged the handle areas
into my shaft.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.801
The whole shaft is as straight
as I can make it,

29:28.835 --> 29:30.369
so we'll get ready
to heat-treat this.

29:30.402 --> 29:33.039
I have never quenched
a hollow tube before.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.506
Kids, don't try this at home.

29:34.540 --> 29:41.447
*

29:41.480 --> 29:43.249
That was exciting.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.452
It's like Mt. Vesuvius
exploding.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.520
It's kind of fun to watch
but a little bit scary, too.

29:48.554 --> 29:49.922
*

29:49.956 --> 29:52.391
There is our hardened tube

29:52.424 --> 29:54.293
of 1084 steel.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.095
I got a lot of work done,

29:56.128 --> 29:59.365
but I've got a lot of work
still ahead of me.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.100
*

30:01.133 --> 30:02.869
- I got all the forging done.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.037
Everything forged into
rough shape.

30:05.071 --> 30:08.908
The first step today is get the
parts of the mace cut to shape.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.177
So far, so good.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.612
The five pieces have
to be consistent

30:13.645 --> 30:17.449
so when you look at that mace
everything's perfect.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.018
All in a row.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.386
I'm feeling pretty good.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.554
I'm ahead of schedule.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.523
Finally done shaping.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.092
Now it's time to heat-treat.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.227
What could go wrong?

30:28.260 --> 30:30.529
All the work so far
is coming down to this step.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.899
If I don't get this right,
the rest of the time

30:32.932 --> 30:34.633
will have been
for nothing, really.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.568
Okay. Axe head's going in.

30:36.602 --> 30:43.542
*

30:45.912 --> 30:49.381
I got the heat-treating done.
I couldn't be happier.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.518
- I feel like
I'm a bit ahead of my game.

30:52.551 --> 30:56.355
Yesterday, I forged out my tabar
axe as well as the flanges.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.224
Today, I need to do
all my heat-treating,

30:58.257 --> 31:00.092
and that's really important.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.895
Grab my wire
so I can do all these together

31:02.929 --> 31:04.897
and then do the axe

31:04.931 --> 31:06.265
'cause I want to be
a little more careful with it.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.667
I need to focus on not
making mistakes.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.970
Without the heat-treat,
I don't have a weapon.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.939
*

31:12.972 --> 31:15.507
Despite all the work I've done,
nothing matters

31:15.541 --> 31:18.444
until this thing comes out
of that oil looking happy.

31:18.477 --> 31:23.549
*

31:23.582 --> 31:26.418
It's an axe.
I'm feeling really good.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.188
I got my flanges heat-treated.
I got the axe heat-treated.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.623
And tomorrow I can work
on assembly.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.960
*

31:33.993 --> 31:36.662
- I will be spending a lot
of time on the grinder today.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.564
It's time to start
grinding things to shape.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.667
So we're cruising downhill
from here.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.635
*

31:43.669 --> 31:45.471
Yeah.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.073
For three days I was thinking,

31:47.106 --> 31:49.441
"Everything is going
too darn smooth.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.642
Something's gonna happen."

31:50.676 --> 31:54.413
And it did.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.215
- I found two cracks.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.017
Right now,
I'm looking at two options.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.052
I can try and make
this one work,

32:00.086 --> 32:01.453
or start over
and make a new one.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.589
I may be able
to save this blade.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.624
I'm gonna cut this out
right like this.

32:05.657 --> 32:08.060
I could cut around
the first crack

32:08.094 --> 32:10.629
and grind out the one on top.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.531
I'm not taking
any chances with this.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.333
I don't want to have it
fail on me.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.002
So I'm gonna give this thing

32:16.035 --> 32:17.636
the toughest test
that I could give it.

32:17.669 --> 32:22.341
*

32:22.374 --> 32:24.276
I think it'll be good.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.545
*

32:26.578 --> 32:30.216
- I finished the mace yesterday.
I'm happy.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.351
I need to put on an axe.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.486
The axe head's gonna need
to be really springy

32:34.520 --> 32:36.989
and really tough,
and it's gonna need to chop.

32:37.023 --> 32:41.093
Maybe the meanest axe/mace combo
in the lower 48.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.162
I got to sharpen it, test it.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.397
Happy to be getting thisa.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.034
You trying to help out?
I want to see what it can do.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.568
I want to see it blow up
some produce.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.504
*

32:52.538 --> 32:57.309
That's a feisty melon.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.711
And it's out of the park.

32:59.745 --> 33:03.049
This thing is evil
and I love it.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.583
It's a little hard to control
because of the weight

33:04.616 --> 33:07.019
but it shouldn't be a problem.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.021
I'm ready to win.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.790
*

33:11.823 --> 33:14.160
- Mark, Chris,
welcome back to the Forge.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.162
You've both had five days
at your home forges

33:16.195 --> 33:17.196
to work on your weapons.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.131
Mark, how did it go?

33:19.165 --> 33:21.233
- It was one of the most
grueling things I ever did.

33:21.267 --> 33:25.571
I made it Damascus
for the axe head and the mace.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.073
It was fun. I had a great time.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.674
It was challenging.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.309
- Chris, how did it go
at your home forge?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.111
- I had a blast.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.645
I've never made
one of these before,

33:33.679 --> 33:35.714
so it was a really great
opportunity

33:35.747 --> 33:38.184
to try something new and step
outside my comfort zone.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.486
I wanted to make sure
that my weapon was very tough,

33:40.519 --> 33:41.787
to make sure that it
would stand up to anything

33:41.820 --> 33:44.456
that you guys throw at it today.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.293
- Well, gentlemen, now it's time
for the weapons test.

33:47.326 --> 33:50.429
Up first, everybody's favorite,
the kill test.

33:50.462 --> 33:51.497
Doug?

33:51.530 --> 33:54.066
*

33:54.100 --> 33:57.269
- Bladesmiths,
the tabar-shishpar is one weapon

33:57.303 --> 33:59.305
with multiple personalities.

33:59.338 --> 34:02.274
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

34:02.308 --> 34:03.709
I will take your tabar-shishpar

34:03.742 --> 34:06.078
and use both ends
to deliver killing blows

34:06.112 --> 34:08.214
on this ballistics dummy.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.348
Mark, you're up first.
You ready?

34:09.381 --> 34:10.649
- Mm-hmm. Let's see it.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.618
- Let's do this.

34:12.651 --> 34:14.853
- I am a little nervous.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.722
Anything can happen.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.191
Did I do everything

34:19.225 --> 34:23.629
as good as I could do it?

34:23.662 --> 34:30.569
*

34:39.311 --> 34:41.380
*

34:41.413 --> 34:44.216
- Well, Mark, it is sharp.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.719
That chopped right
into the chest cavity,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.321
breaking a bone.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.458
This axe dug in and gutted him.

34:52.491 --> 34:55.527
Your mace definitely will crush.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.630
You can see the breaking bones
inside.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.299
Your weapon will kill.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.668
- Thank you.
- Chris, you ready?

35:02.701 --> 35:05.537
- I am.
- Let's do this.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.506
- I'm confident my weapon
is gonna pass

35:07.539 --> 35:09.641
any of the performance tests.

35:09.675 --> 35:13.812
It's just a question of whether
Mark's passes them better.

35:13.845 --> 35:20.719
*

35:27.359 --> 35:29.361
[laughing]

35:29.395 --> 35:30.729
- Oh, my gosh!

35:30.762 --> 35:33.365
Into the lung, into the heart.

35:33.399 --> 35:36.935
Your mace definitely
penetrated through the skull.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.671
Bones are broken.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.507
I don't think
it's gonna end well.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.875
You weapon is heavy

35:43.909 --> 35:46.512
and I'm not a fan
of heavy weapons.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.314
Only because you have
to carry it to battle.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.949
But overall, it will kill.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.951
- Thank you.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.687
- I feel like
the first round went to Chris.

35:55.721 --> 35:59.825
His weapon did more damage
on the dummy than mine.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.561
- All right, gentlemen.
This is the sharpness test.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.430
The tabar only has
one sharp area,

36:04.463 --> 36:06.298
which is the axe head.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.834
So I'll strike into this side
of beef six times

36:08.867 --> 36:10.969
with each of your axes.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.438
Mark, you're up first.
Are you ready for this?

36:12.471 --> 36:14.573
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

36:14.606 --> 36:21.380
*

36:36.328 --> 36:37.829
*

36:37.863 --> 36:39.598
Your weapon's nice and light

36:39.631 --> 36:42.768
for a weapon that looks as heavy
as this is.

36:42.801 --> 36:46.738
You can see that this went
right through the ribs.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.574
This is definitely a cutter.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.442
Good job.
- Thank you.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.278
- Chris, you ready?

36:52.311 --> 36:54.513
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.814
- Listening to the feedback
for Mark's weapon,

36:55.847 --> 36:57.583
I'm really nervous.

36:57.616 --> 37:01.587
I hope mine lives up
to the same performance.

37:01.620 --> 37:08.560
*

37:20.539 --> 37:22.841
[laughs]

37:24.410 --> 37:26.978
- Well, right off,
the weight difference--

37:27.012 --> 37:29.781
I mean, this thing
hits like a ton.

37:29.815 --> 37:33.619
These hooks tear meat
coming out the back way.

37:33.652 --> 37:37.856
Your edge--there's no damage
that I can feel.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.658
It's heavy,

37:39.691 --> 37:42.628
but it does a hell of a lot of
damage.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.396
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.398
The weight of my axe,

37:46.432 --> 37:49.368
I'm hoping that its performance
makes up for the fact

37:49.401 --> 37:51.803
that it's a little harder to
use than what they're used to.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.306
- All right, gentlemen.
This is the strength test.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.674
Now, to test the strength
and durability

37:55.707 --> 37:57.843
of your tabar-shishpars,

37:57.876 --> 38:01.046
I'll be using all parts of it
to strike this suit of armor.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.781
Mark, you're up. You ready?

38:02.814 --> 38:07.819
- Yes, I am. Let's see it.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.621
- The real concern of mine

38:09.655 --> 38:13.459
is retaining the edge
on my axe head.

38:15.494 --> 38:22.334
*

38:31.142 --> 38:34.480
*

38:34.513 --> 38:35.981
- Edge is still perfect.

38:36.014 --> 38:38.684
No chips. No rolling.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.019
The hammer gave that armor
a nice dent.

38:41.052 --> 38:43.121
Didn't take any damage.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.790
The mace is fine.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.692
The guy inside there
was not happy.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.594
- [laughs]

38:48.627 --> 38:50.061
- All right, Chris.
You ready for this?

38:50.095 --> 38:52.564
- Don't hold back.
- I'm not gonna.

38:52.598 --> 38:58.003
*

38:58.036 --> 39:00.972
[heavy rock music]

39:01.006 --> 39:07.913
*

39:14.453 --> 39:17.022
*

39:17.055 --> 39:19.591
This is a heavy weapon.
- Yeah.

39:19.625 --> 39:24.530
- I mean, I can control it,
but I don't have any rebound.

39:24.563 --> 39:29.601
And you got just the smallest
bit of edge deformation here.

39:29.635 --> 39:32.938
Other than that,
the mace is a devastator.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.574
You made a beautiful piece.
- Thank you.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.776
I hope the judges
appreciate the devastation

39:37.809 --> 39:39.678
my weapon's capable of bringing.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.848
It's hard to say
who's gonna win.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.851
- Bladesmiths, the judges'
deliberation is complete,

39:45.884 --> 39:49.187
and there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" Champion.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.722
And that champion is...

39:50.756 --> 39:53.759
*

39:53.792 --> 39:55.827
Mark. Congratulations.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.496
You are the "Forged
in Fire" Champion.

39:57.529 --> 39:58.930
- Thank you.

39:58.964 --> 40:01.733
Good job, buddy.
- Thanks.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.536
- Chris, your blade
did not make the cut.

40:04.570 --> 40:05.837
David Baker will explain.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.072
- Chris, Doug and I both agree

40:07.105 --> 40:08.907
that the extreme weight

40:08.940 --> 40:11.877
of your weapon
made it difficult to control,

40:11.910 --> 40:14.012
and frankly, I'm still
feeling it in my arm.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.814
That, combined with that minor
edge damage

40:15.847 --> 40:17.716
you took in the strength test,

40:17.749 --> 40:19.117
those are the reasons
we're letting you go.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.953
- Understood.
- Chris, it's that time.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.922
Please surrender your weapon.

40:23.955 --> 40:27.859
*

40:27.893 --> 40:29.060
- Ahh!

40:29.094 --> 40:32.097
[laughs]
Sorry.

40:32.130 --> 40:35.801
I just--
[laughing]

40:35.834 --> 40:37.769
[sighs]

40:37.803 --> 40:40.138
I think I put up the best
I was capable of

40:40.171 --> 40:41.940
in the time that I was given.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.809
- See you later, buddy.
- Congratulations.

40:43.842 --> 40:45.644
Mark did good work,

40:45.677 --> 40:47.713
and his was just
a little bit better.

40:47.746 --> 40:50.882
*

40:50.916 --> 40:54.252
- Mark, congratulations, you are
the "Forged in Fire" Champion

40:54.285 --> 40:56.154
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.188
Good job.

40:57.222 --> 41:01.159
[applause]

41:01.192 --> 41:02.628
How do you feel right now?

41:02.661 --> 41:03.895
- I feel great.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.498
Chris, hell of an opponent.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.033
I'm glad it went
to the very end.

41:08.066 --> 41:10.836
I wanted to see
a real competition.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.004
- Mark, please present
your weapon to the judges

41:13.038 --> 41:14.506
and shake our hands.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.608
- I won. I am the champion.

41:16.642 --> 41:19.878
[sighs]
Unbelievable.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.947
I just won $10,000.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.915
My wife and I, we made a deal.

41:23.949 --> 41:26.585
She gets $9,000,

41:26.618 --> 41:27.819
and I get $1,000.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.955
So congratulations, dear.

41:29.988 --> 41:35.894
