WEBVTT

00:03.296 --> 00:05.507
The runes have been etched.

00:05.674 --> 00:09.010
Things are happening
ahead of schedule.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.929
You started the first war.

00:11.096 --> 00:14.182
And you'll finish the last.
One more step.

00:15.392 --> 00:18.103
Grow, Yggdrasil. Grow.

00:18.895 --> 00:22.148
I went to war once
Or was meant to. I owe a battle.

00:22.315 --> 00:23.858
You're following Wednesday

00:24.025 --> 00:26.027
so that you can fight
in his war and die

00:26.194 --> 00:28.238
and for that,
you run his errands?

00:28.405 --> 00:30.323
This is all Wednesday!
He sends you

00:30.490 --> 00:32.742
to fuck my plan and then
he sends you to fuck me?

00:32.909 --> 00:34.828
What happened
last night is not part

00:34.994 --> 00:36.996
of some grand plan,
you stupid cunt!

00:37.163 --> 00:39.416
And I don't do Wednesday's
errands because I like him!

00:39.582 --> 00:42.460
I do 'em because
I fucking owe him!

00:43.044 --> 00:46.798
I hate that one-eyed cunt
more than you will ever know.

03:01.891 --> 03:03.309
Hey.

03:08.273 --> 03:10.191
You're really gonna
make me haul that big ass

03:10.358 --> 03:12.277
back to the morgue, huh?

03:15.905 --> 03:17.824
Touch me again
and I'll be hauling you

03:17.991 --> 03:20.660
to the morgue, you cunt.

03:20.827 --> 03:22.287
Good morning, Sweeney.

03:23.538 --> 03:24.789
Ah!

03:27.625 --> 03:29.544
You know, you keep
hanging out under bridges;

03:29.711 --> 03:31.796
people are gonna start
thinking you're a troll.

03:37.135 --> 03:39.053
Maybe I am a troll.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.973
Well, you told me you were
a leprechaun, so which is it?

03:42.682 --> 03:44.809
Sometimes,
I remember things one way.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.520
Sometimes,
I remember them another.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.858
- How the fuck did you find me?
- Cops called.

03:52.025 --> 03:54.444
Said there was a dead wino
under the bridge.

03:56.112 --> 03:58.448
Spotted me a 20
if I'd haul him back myself.

03:58.615 --> 04:00.909
Then you owe me 20 bucks
for saving you the effort.

04:03.369 --> 04:05.955
You can literally pull
gold out of the air

04:06.122 --> 04:08.249
and you're asking me for money?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.127
The sun's treasure.

04:18.468 --> 04:20.553
Not much good to you now, is it?

04:22.096 --> 04:24.182
Only coin that matters
is locked up with the worms

04:24.349 --> 04:26.184
in the dead wife's chest.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.353
And she left your Irish ass
high and dry

04:28.519 --> 04:31.189
like fucking bird bones,
didn't she?

04:31.356 --> 04:34.067
The further you get from her...

04:34.233 --> 04:35.902
...the worse your luck gets.

04:39.572 --> 04:41.282
Did you see Laura?

04:43.993 --> 04:45.536
Dead wife...

04:50.375 --> 04:51.542
Fuck!

04:52.961 --> 04:54.629
Fuck her!

04:54.796 --> 04:56.714
- Hey. Come on, hey.
- Fuck 'em all.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.633
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.426
Hey, stay with me.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.303
Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.847
- Where's Laura?
- What?

05:09.268 --> 05:11.729
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.816
For that 20-dollar bill you got
in your fucking pocket.

05:14.983 --> 05:17.068
You're fucking kidding me.

05:17.235 --> 05:19.278
- There. Where is she?
- Oh.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.364
I can smell the whiskey
on your breath already,

05:21.531 --> 05:23.866
Ben Franklin.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.952
Hey! Fucking...
tell me. Hey.

05:26.119 --> 05:28.079
Where is Laura?

05:28.246 --> 05:29.914
How the fuck should I know?

05:30.081 --> 05:32.000
I thought she might be here.

05:36.713 --> 05:39.340
I saw her in New Orleans.
She was fine.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.634
I pissed her off good
and she ran away.

05:42.719 --> 05:44.345
To get back to you.

05:47.015 --> 05:48.558
Come on.

05:58.985 --> 06:00.820
I'm gonna tell you something.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.198
This is gallows ground
you're walking.

06:05.283 --> 06:07.368
And there's a rope
around your neck

06:07.535 --> 06:11.039
and a raven-bird on each
shoulder waiting for your eyes.

06:12.331 --> 06:14.250
The gallows tree has deep roots.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.086
It stretches from heaven
all the way down to hell.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.214
And this world...

06:20.381 --> 06:25.303
...is the only branch from
which the rope is swingin'.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.767
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

06:32.518 --> 06:35.980
Yggdrasil is ready for war;
ergo, I am ready, too.

06:36.147 --> 06:38.399
The only question,
gentlemen, is,

06:38.566 --> 06:40.818
do we know
who all our friends are?

06:41.235 --> 06:44.197
Ah... Jacquel will come
when you call.

06:45.031 --> 06:46.365
Set and Horus, too.

06:46.532 --> 06:48.242
I know some
ifrits in Chicago.

06:49.285 --> 06:51.412
And Mama-ji,
Czernobog...

06:52.371 --> 06:53.915
Nancy, Bilquis.

06:54.082 --> 06:56.417
Bilquis?
No, that one is...

06:59.962 --> 07:02.590
Shadow?
Shadow is my eyes and ears.

07:02.757 --> 07:04.842
You can speak freely
in front of him.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.721
We cannot rely
on the Queen of Sheba.

07:08.888 --> 07:10.431
She's with us.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.101
All-father,
that one is for herself.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.019
We all are.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.313
The trick to wrangling
cats is to dangle bait

07:17.480 --> 07:19.190
they can all want.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.734
And Bast. We've got Bast.

07:21.901 --> 07:24.153
- And Mad Sweeney?
- Mm. Sweeney.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.405
I just...
I just saw him.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.325
Yes?

07:29.492 --> 07:33.246
Yeah, he's...
he's in really bad shape.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.997
Really?

07:35.164 --> 07:37.250
Well, if he really is
in bad shape,

07:37.416 --> 07:39.669
if he's on his last legs,
then look on the bright side.

07:39.836 --> 07:41.796
He's in the right
place, isn't he?

07:41.963 --> 07:44.006
Another thing about living

07:44.173 --> 07:46.509
in a funeral home is
you never have to cook.

07:46.676 --> 07:48.594
Mourners are always bringing by
their best food.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.388
Oh, how rude of me.

07:50.555 --> 07:52.348
Would you like a taste of this
potato salad, Shadow?

07:52.515 --> 07:54.142
I'm good.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.478
Wise choice.
This is not exactly piquant.

07:57.645 --> 08:00.398
Gentlemen, I have something
for Shadow's eyes and ears only,

08:00.565 --> 08:02.358
if you'll excuse me.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.801
Sorry, Yggdrasil.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.305
You know I have to do this.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.779
Sialfr sialfom mer.

08:52.325 --> 08:54.202
My spear, Gungnir.

08:55.036 --> 08:56.996
The finest in the cosmos.

08:58.039 --> 09:02.001
Head forged by the dwarves,
the shaft carved from Yggdrasil.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.837
Her aim true and always fatal.

09:05.004 --> 09:07.089
She can kill an army
as quick as a god

09:07.256 --> 09:11.844
and every soul she takes
is a tribute to me.

09:32.073 --> 09:35.159
Guard my spear
as you will guard my life.

09:35.326 --> 09:37.411
We are the same.

09:38.537 --> 09:41.540
Wars are coming, Shadow.
I have a big role for you.

09:45.878 --> 09:49.340
♪ You're breaking me up ♪

09:49.966 --> 09:55.721
♪ And I don't mean maybe
it's too late ♪

09:55.888 --> 09:58.891
♪ Little itty bitty pieces,
baby... ♪

10:00.017 --> 10:02.228
♪ First you promise me
your love... ♪

10:03.437 --> 10:06.440
Get out, dead girl or I'm
calling the health department.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.609
Oh. It's you.
Wednesday's pal.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.903
No. You are Wednesday's pal.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.030
Uh, no, I'm not.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.288
I know this is not an accident.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.832
You tell me why you are
here in my domain.

10:22.999 --> 10:25.084
Well, your domain
is a fuckin' diner

10:25.251 --> 10:27.336
on the side
of the road. So.

10:28.587 --> 10:30.798
I thought you were a Goddess.
Where are your worshippers?

10:30.965 --> 10:33.134
My worshippers are here.

10:33.301 --> 10:36.262
This diner life?
It's not too bad.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.223
Of course, the little
second-generation assholes,

10:39.390 --> 10:42.852
they come in with
their MBAs, their MDs,

10:43.019 --> 10:45.396
raging egos like yours.

10:45.563 --> 10:48.024
You know that I can literally
rip people's limbs off, right?

10:51.444 --> 10:56.115
Do not goad me, dead girl.
I have no time for this.

10:56.574 --> 10:59.618
You see me here as
Kali-ma, the nurturer?

11:00.119 --> 11:03.539
But you, dead girl, perhaps
you would understand me better

11:03.706 --> 11:06.584
as Smashana Kali, the destroyer.

11:19.597 --> 11:21.807
So, do we understand
each other better now?

11:23.184 --> 11:25.186
A little respect is all I ask.

11:25.353 --> 11:27.688
A little help is
what I can give.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.232
Do you need direction?

11:30.900 --> 11:32.485
Or cream, sugar?

11:32.651 --> 11:35.029
- For real?
- For real.

11:37.615 --> 11:40.201
Okay. Um...

11:40.368 --> 11:42.203
I need blood.

11:42.370 --> 11:45.623
Two drops of blood
"infused with love"

11:45.790 --> 11:49.710
for a magic potion that's
gonna bring me back to life.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.504
Sounds like voodoo.

11:52.338 --> 11:56.258
That goddamn voudon.
Always so dramatic.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.053
The problem is not
with the potion;

11:59.220 --> 12:01.055
it is why you take it.

12:01.222 --> 12:02.681
Oh, really?

12:02.848 --> 12:05.142
Is that what
your crystal ball says?

12:05.893 --> 12:09.146
Sorry. This is not
some bloody psychic reading.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.358
Why do you think I showed you
the face of the destroyer?

12:14.360 --> 12:15.903
Pay attention.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.155
You have the power here,
in your heart.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.241
The angry leprechaun
gave it to you.

12:20.408 --> 12:22.118
- No, he didn't.
- The coin!

12:22.827 --> 12:24.829
Can you not see
you have the power here

12:24.995 --> 12:26.914
in your own heart?

12:27.081 --> 12:30.000
What, like, the power of love?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.502
No.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.214
The power to destroy.

12:46.809 --> 12:51.355
♪ Now today you want my love,
tomorrow you don't want it ♪

12:51.522 --> 12:55.776

12:55.943 --> 13:00.197

13:54.126 --> 13:55.252
Banshee!

14:05.763 --> 14:07.264
Mornin', pillow biter.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.311
Door's always open, you know.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.104
Sure.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.358
Let me ask you something.

14:17.525 --> 14:20.110
Can you hear that?
The wailing?

14:20.277 --> 14:22.905
The grieving women outside? Yes.

14:24.198 --> 14:26.700
They're not mortals.
They're banshee.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.577
They are women
who lost a husband,

14:28.744 --> 14:30.621
a son, and a father last night.

14:30.788 --> 14:32.748
Ibis has prepared his body
for the burial.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.792
Hey, are you...

14:34.959 --> 14:37.086
Are you all right? Do you need
to lie down or something?

14:38.212 --> 14:39.922
Where is the old
one-eyed fuck?

14:40.089 --> 14:42.049
He's busy. Come on,
let me make you some tea.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.759
Ah, fuck off!

14:46.971 --> 14:49.431
When Jesus had given thanks,

14:50.683 --> 14:52.726
He broke the bread, and said,

14:54.061 --> 14:57.856
"This is My body,
which is for you."

14:59.900 --> 15:04.780
And all those who loved Him
took His body into their mouths,

15:06.407 --> 15:10.786
took His body deep down
into their own bodies,

15:11.787 --> 15:16.500
until His body filled
their bodies with the divine.

15:17.376 --> 15:19.670
The gift of the flesh...

15:20.921 --> 15:24.383
...is the most sacred gift
one can make.

15:25.593 --> 15:27.011
I read to you

15:27.177 --> 15:29.346
from the Psalm of Psalms.

15:35.436 --> 15:36.979
"Your love...

15:38.606 --> 15:40.399
...is better than wine,

15:40.566 --> 15:45.195
your scent better
than any perfume.

15:46.405 --> 15:51.368
Your lips drip
with nectar, my bride;

15:51.535 --> 15:53.787
honey and milk
are under your tongue.

15:54.163 --> 15:56.123
You are a garden.

15:56.957 --> 16:01.754
Your shoots are orchards
of pomegranates,

16:01.920 --> 16:04.965
henna, saffron,

16:06.175 --> 16:07.926
calamus and cinnamon,

16:08.802 --> 16:11.889
frankincense and myrrh.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.476
You are a fountain.

16:20.606 --> 16:25.486
You are all the streams
flowing from Lebanon.

16:27.071 --> 16:31.950
Let the wind blow
upon your garden.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.998
Let the divine, through Me...

16:40.000 --> 16:44.004
...enter your garden
and taste your fruit.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.600
This how you gettin'
your rocks off these days?

16:58.686 --> 17:01.146
No more bottomless holy hole?

17:01.480 --> 17:04.274
I adapt. We all do.

17:04.775 --> 17:06.860
Some of us more than others.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.864
The stories that are told
about you

17:13.325 --> 17:17.996
have reached my ears
over the years, too.

17:19.873 --> 17:23.460
The leprechaun, the hill spirit

17:24.586 --> 17:27.297
the pagan warrior, the mad man,

17:28.340 --> 17:30.926
and the great and golden king.

17:33.011 --> 17:36.306
You haven't always been... this.

17:37.433 --> 17:38.851
Ah, well...

17:39.893 --> 17:41.562
It's all bollocks anyway.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.151
Don't remember much of it
these days.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.001
I will not have you.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.881
I will have your confession.

18:11.175 --> 18:15.387
The Queen of Sheba...
playing a priest.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.641
I need a fuckin' drink.

18:25.314 --> 18:26.940
There was a girl.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.361
I remember that much.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.864
She had the sight.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.450
And she let me play with
her boobies under the stars,

18:37.159 --> 18:39.453
and she told me my fortune.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.957
Told me I'd be undone and
abandoned west of the sunrise,

18:44.124 --> 18:46.960
and that a dead woman's bauble
would seal my fate.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.798
And I laughed and I poured
more barley wine

18:50.964 --> 18:53.091
and played with her boobies
some more,

18:53.258 --> 18:56.470
and I kissed her full
on her pretty breasts.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.475
Those were the last
of the good days.

19:01.642 --> 19:03.852
The Gray Monks were changin'
our stories.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.688
Makin' us fair folk
into greedy little green men,

19:06.855 --> 19:08.565
which is all fucking bollocks.

19:08.732 --> 19:10.275
I used to be...

19:12.277 --> 19:13.821
Can't remember.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.323
Keep going.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.408
In one of the stories they tell

19:18.575 --> 19:21.036
a monk named St. Moling
had me killed that night.

19:21.703 --> 19:25.624
In another, it was his swineherd
or his cooks - neater that way,

19:25.791 --> 19:28.377
if you want to strip away
what little dignity I had left.

19:28.544 --> 19:31.380
Poor Mad Sweeney,
felled by the soup maker.

19:31.547 --> 19:33.465
This isn't true.

19:33.632 --> 19:36.260
You didn't die that way and
her fortune didn't come true.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.804
Fuck if I know
what the truth is.

19:38.971 --> 19:42.307
I heard a different story.
You had a wife.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.768
A wife?

20:07.416 --> 20:09.710
Aha!

20:12.170 --> 20:14.590
Grimnir.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.675
Oh, I know that smell.

20:16.842 --> 20:18.760
That smells like
a hot bottle of whiskey

20:18.927 --> 20:21.805
and sex in an alleyway
with a top note of failure!

20:21.972 --> 20:24.558
Yeah, yeah. Eau de fuck-up.
It's gotta be, yes, it is!

20:24.725 --> 20:27.311
The one and only Mad Sweeney!

20:27.477 --> 20:30.814
I knew Ibis'd have some Dijon
around here somewhere.

20:32.566 --> 20:35.736
You're welcome, Grimnir.
For everything.

20:35.903 --> 20:38.155
For every shitty task
you've ever set before me--

20:38.322 --> 20:41.158
Sounds like my man's asking
for a tip for service.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.327
Not your man anymore.

20:44.494 --> 20:47.873
- I'm quitting.
- Oh, no, you're not.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.042
You most certainly are not.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.711
We have a contract,
which you have not fulfilled.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.796
I've done everything
you've ever asked of me.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.257
We're gonna come to terms
right now, you old fuck.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.468
I killed the wife for you
the first time.

20:59.635 --> 21:01.345
Lost my coin in the process.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.055
Way I see it,
the debt swung my way

21:03.221 --> 21:05.140
the moment the dead wife
stole my treasure.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.225
You know, I wouldn't go around,
if I was you, advertising

21:07.392 --> 21:09.311
you lost your treasure
to a rotten little dead girl

21:09.478 --> 21:11.271
who weighs less than
a hundred pounds.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.565
Hm?

21:13.732 --> 21:17.527
You know, why don't you just
reach in and take it from her?

21:18.820 --> 21:20.864
It's got to be given
voluntarily.

21:21.031 --> 21:23.325
Oh. Wait 'til the maggots
offer it up on a golden platter.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.410
You might not have a code
of honor, Grimnir, but I do.

21:25.577 --> 21:29.247
She's dead, stupid! Unless
you've gone sweet on her?

21:29.414 --> 21:33.043
- I don't give a fuck about her!
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that lousy smell.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.128
That is the rotten stench
of a broken heart.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.005
She fuck you?
She ditch you?

21:37.172 --> 21:39.091
Well, fucking get over it
and do the job

21:39.257 --> 21:41.468
- I asked you to do!
- No.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.431
- No?
- No.

21:48.016 --> 21:50.227
You'd renege on a contract
with a god?

21:51.311 --> 21:54.064
When I met you, you were
just a horny muscle-head

21:54.231 --> 21:55.941
with a lot of cash

21:56.108 --> 21:59.528
and with nothing of value to
whatever was left of your name.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.824
Now, you are whatever
I make you.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.953
You owe me a battle, Grimnir!

22:08.120 --> 22:10.122
Forget the code.
Finish off Laura Moon.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.582
And, for fuck's sake,
take a shower, would you?

23:08.513 --> 23:11.141
Don't think I don't know
who you are, banshees!

23:43.381 --> 23:44.966
Who goes there?

23:50.388 --> 23:52.140
What do you want, witch?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.102
It's me...

23:55.268 --> 23:56.812
Eorann. Your wife.

24:06.655 --> 24:07.989
Oh, my queen!

24:09.658 --> 24:11.451
My bonny child.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.037
Yes.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.872
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.500
What is your name, lass?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.002
Remember, the boundaries
of your father's mind

24:21.169 --> 24:22.879
have grown thin
since he left us.

24:23.213 --> 24:24.631
I'm Moira.

24:24.798 --> 24:27.843
Moira.

24:34.975 --> 24:36.768
Will you eat with us?

24:37.769 --> 24:40.438
Yes. Oh, yes.

24:43.066 --> 24:45.068
And what shall we
be eating, Moira?

24:45.235 --> 24:46.736
Bread.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.488
I love bread.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.680
But why are you dressed in rags,
my love?

25:13.847 --> 25:15.849
Where is your dress?

25:17.017 --> 25:19.728
The yellow one
with the red embroidery?

25:20.729 --> 25:22.814
You wore it on our wedding day.

25:23.773 --> 25:25.442
- You remember.
- Oh, yes.

25:25.609 --> 25:27.027
We danced at dinner

25:27.194 --> 25:28.945
and I thought I was
dancing with the sun.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.240
It was I who danced
with the sun.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.035
But what of the dress?

25:40.165 --> 25:43.001
We lost the dress, husband.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.047
We lost the castle.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.884
Your lands, your title,
your people.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.179
We lost the war.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.393
But how?

26:01.561 --> 26:03.939
You abandoned our allies
on the field.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.691
And so Bishop Ronan
laid a curse on you.

26:12.364 --> 26:13.782
The Gray Monks...

26:16.743 --> 26:19.246
Gray Monks were never
our allies!

26:21.539 --> 26:24.167
I told you
they cannot stay!

26:28.588 --> 26:30.090
Gray Monks!

26:30.257 --> 26:32.634
The damned Gray Monks
were never our allies.

26:51.278 --> 26:53.154
What are you doing here?

26:55.365 --> 26:57.367
What's Wednesday got on you?

27:00.161 --> 27:02.539
I am here because
the Jinn is here.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.835
And the Jinn is here because
he owes Mr. Wednesday.

27:08.211 --> 27:10.213
Collects a lot
of debt, don't he?

27:13.341 --> 27:15.051
I told you.

27:16.386 --> 27:17.637
They're banshee.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.598
Harbingers of death.

27:20.765 --> 27:23.727
- They are women in mourning.
- Fine.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.647
Don't believe me.
But I'm telling you.

27:33.153 --> 27:35.155
The Jinn and me,
we have to stay

27:35.322 --> 27:37.532
'cause we owe Wednesday.
But you...

27:38.575 --> 27:40.243
...you could leave
at any time.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.706
This war that's comin', it
could end in your boy's death.

27:44.873 --> 27:47.292
Doesn't have to end in yours.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.880
You got 80 years
on your dial.

27:52.047 --> 27:53.840
You're gonna give 'em up

27:54.007 --> 27:56.301
for somebody
who's gonna live forever.

27:56.468 --> 27:58.845
That's how love works.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.559
Do you think he'd do
the same for you?

28:06.019 --> 28:09.856
I mean, if... if Wednesday
asked the Jinn to kill you...

28:11.232 --> 28:13.151
...do you think
he would do it?

28:13.318 --> 28:15.278
Do you know
something I don't?

28:15.445 --> 28:17.530
No.

28:18.573 --> 28:19.991
Never mind.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.911
I...

28:24.079 --> 28:27.749
I can't explain love to
someone who has never felt it.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.086
Oh, I've felt it.

28:34.381 --> 28:36.132
I had a family.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.344
I had a wife.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.723
I had a kingdom.

28:48.311 --> 28:50.772
I'm starting to remember now.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.817
- Listen to reason!
- I've had enough reason!

28:53.983 --> 28:56.111
And have you had
enough of me?!

29:01.908 --> 29:03.535
No.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.497
I do this for you, my love.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.416
For our family.

29:11.376 --> 29:14.003
The Gray Monks are poison,
pestilence;

29:14.170 --> 29:16.005
they will ruin
everything they touch.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.049
I don't doubt you think so.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.593
- But the world is changing.
- It doesn't have to.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.221
It does. That's what
the world does. It changes.

29:25.515 --> 29:27.308
Look at my belly.

29:29.519 --> 29:32.397
It changes too, and soon,
we will have a child.

29:37.110 --> 29:39.571
So, when the world changes,

29:41.114 --> 29:43.158
I beg you to change with it.

29:46.578 --> 29:48.121
With us.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.626
Are you asking me
to cozy up to our enemies?

29:53.793 --> 29:55.712
I'm asking you
to make alliances

29:55.879 --> 29:57.964
instead of enemies,
that's all.

29:58.882 --> 30:01.634
The Gray Monks seem peaceful.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.053
And influential.
We need them as friends

30:04.220 --> 30:06.139
before they make friends
with those who are our enemies.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.308
I am entirely sure that what
you're saying makes sense to you

30:08.475 --> 30:10.393
but I don't understand
a word of it.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.145
You're too fuckin' beautiful.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.939
You... you understand
every word.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.234
Listen, husband.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.821
Listen to one
who doesn't want

30:21.988 --> 30:25.366
anything from you
but a very long life...

30:27.994 --> 30:29.329
...together.

30:49.974 --> 30:51.809
Can you not hear that?

30:56.606 --> 30:59.817
They are building
churches on our lands!

30:59.984 --> 31:01.778
They are poison, my love.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.322
They cannot stay.

31:07.158 --> 31:09.077
This is why I owe a battle.

31:09.244 --> 31:10.745
I don't understand.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.997
Because of an argument
you had with your wife?

31:13.164 --> 31:15.291
Because I found
Bishop Ronan that day.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.044
I found him and I made
a big bloody row,

31:18.211 --> 31:20.213
threw his little book
of prayers into the lake,

31:20.380 --> 31:22.298
told him to get the fuck out.

31:22.465 --> 31:25.093
Then I speared
one of his priests.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.178
So, the fucker cursed me.

31:27.345 --> 31:29.389
Told his bastard of a god
to rake me through

31:29.556 --> 31:33.059
with the worst of what was in
me at that moment - madness -

31:33.226 --> 31:36.563
and to end me the way I'd ended
his little holy ass-kisser.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.439
By the spear.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.901
Banshee.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.487
I heard them on the battlefield
at Mag Rath.

31:44.654 --> 31:47.073
I knew then
that I'd die that night

31:47.240 --> 31:50.326
by the spear
like the Bishop said.

31:51.869 --> 31:53.288
Help us.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.210
Help us.

32:01.045 --> 32:02.964
So, I walked away.

32:03.131 --> 32:07.051
The war, my family, my mind.

32:08.386 --> 32:11.681
I lost it all
because I left it all.

32:11.848 --> 32:13.975
Well, it's not the
version you told me.

32:14.142 --> 32:16.060
Where the girl with
the big tits told you you'd die

32:16.227 --> 32:18.688
by a dead girl's bauble.
So, which is it?

32:18.855 --> 32:20.773
What the fuck, Bilquis?

32:51.763 --> 32:53.765
You spend that 20 yet?

32:55.058 --> 32:56.893
Thinking about using it now.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.443
Don't let her near him.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.071
Your wife.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.741
Don't let her near Grimnir.

33:11.908 --> 33:13.785
Grimnir's nothin' but rot.

33:15.244 --> 33:17.080
Why do you even care?

33:20.875 --> 33:22.377
I warned you.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.005
- Let's just leave it at that.
- Fine.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.384
Well, don't worry
about me. I'm good.

33:29.550 --> 33:32.720
Wednesday even gave me
his magic stick to guard, so...

33:35.098 --> 33:36.516
Gungnir.

33:39.936 --> 33:43.272
- You think you earned it.
- Mm-hmm.

33:45.149 --> 33:49.278
You have the All-father's
favor today and it feels good.

33:49.445 --> 33:51.364
Doesn't it?

33:52.407 --> 33:54.992
Like the sun is shining
on your fuckin' face.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.328
Like you did something
to deserve it.

33:57.495 --> 33:59.163
Tomorrow you'll be me, Shadow.

34:00.581 --> 34:01.874
The dog he kicks.

34:03.584 --> 34:05.586
There's always
a cost with him.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.839
Just haven't paid it yet.

34:08.881 --> 34:11.092
Why do you let him
treat you like that?

34:13.594 --> 34:16.806
You think you're not
his bitch? Hm?

34:18.099 --> 34:20.935
I watched you
sign your life away.

34:21.894 --> 34:25.356
Right there in front of me
in Jack's Crocodile Bar.

34:26.733 --> 34:30.528
You're his man now.
You're his bodyguard.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.989
And when he dies,

34:33.156 --> 34:36.325
you're the punk that's gonna
have to hold his vigil.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.331
You're fucked, man.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.835
Spoken like the dog
he just kicked.

34:53.050 --> 34:55.136
You remember how I did
that little coin trick?

34:56.471 --> 34:58.389
Huh?

34:58.556 --> 35:00.683
Figured you just took
the coins out of nowhere.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.436
Not outta nowhere.

35:05.646 --> 35:07.398
I take 'em from the Hoard.

35:09.025 --> 35:11.152
You just have to hold it
in your mind...

35:12.361 --> 35:14.405
...and you can take
whatever you want from it.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.575
The sun's treasure.

35:20.495 --> 35:23.748
You can keep whatever's
precious to you.

35:31.506 --> 35:32.924
Bring it back.

35:33.090 --> 35:35.134
How's it feel
to lose your lucky coin?

35:35.301 --> 35:37.136
I'm not gonna ask you again.

35:41.140 --> 35:44.227
You're not my battle,
Moon Shadow.

35:45.895 --> 35:49.941
Promise me something
and I promise I'll give it back.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.862
What do you want?

36:03.788 --> 36:05.665
You hear that wailing outside?

36:07.124 --> 36:09.001
Do you know what it means?

36:09.919 --> 36:11.671
People get sad
at a funeral home.

36:14.382 --> 36:16.467
Means death is coming
to this house.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.012
Someone here is gonna die soon.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.517
When the time comes...

36:26.894 --> 36:28.729
don't get in the fucking way.

36:30.147 --> 36:32.066
What the fuck
does that even mean?

36:35.027 --> 36:36.445
You'll know.

36:41.826 --> 36:43.369
Deal?

36:47.290 --> 36:48.583
Yeah.

36:50.585 --> 36:51.752
Whatever.

37:01.637 --> 37:02.763
Wednesday...

37:04.390 --> 37:05.558
Me...

37:06.851 --> 37:08.394
Fuck all the gods.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.690
We're not the heroes, Shadow.

37:37.131 --> 37:38.341
Ah...

37:40.384 --> 37:41.969
Tastes better cold.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.513
There's no more
in the fridge.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.349
I ain't after the taste anyway.

38:00.363 --> 38:02.073
What you writin'?

38:02.239 --> 38:04.241
Same story you've
been writing all day.

38:04.408 --> 38:09.038
Ah. Ah, so, you're trying
to get inside my head, too?

38:09.205 --> 38:11.165
Good luck with that one.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.501
The friendly faggot
and the maneater

38:13.668 --> 38:15.628
already looted the place.

38:17.588 --> 38:20.424
You have a lot
of stories in there.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.054
Hard to keep 'em all straight,
isn't it?

38:25.221 --> 38:27.223
A storyteller

38:27.390 --> 38:29.976
does not concern themselves
with the truth.

38:30.935 --> 38:32.687
Stories are truer
than the truth.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.523
These are not literal constructs

38:35.690 --> 38:37.858
so much as imaginative
recreations.

38:56.752 --> 38:58.337
What are you writin' now?

38:59.880 --> 39:02.508
Your earliest story.

39:05.970 --> 39:07.722
The one about me...

39:09.056 --> 39:11.934
...fightin' off all the gods
coming into Ireland?

39:13.686 --> 39:15.604
Wave after wave of 'em,

39:16.564 --> 39:19.483
coming in from Gaul
or from Spain,

39:20.109 --> 39:21.986
from every other
fuckin' place...

39:23.946 --> 39:25.740
...until Mother Church arrived,

39:27.199 --> 39:30.828
turned us all into fairies
and saints and dead kings

39:30.995 --> 39:33.289
without so much
as a by-your-fucking-leave.

39:33.456 --> 39:35.499
They made you small.

39:36.625 --> 39:37.960
I ain't small.

39:38.127 --> 39:40.463
I ain't Wednesday's
fuckin' bitch.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.883
I know.

39:45.342 --> 39:49.805
The story I'm writing is about
Lugh of the Tuatha de Danann,

39:49.972 --> 39:53.059
the ancient race of Gods
in old Ireland.

39:54.185 --> 39:55.728
You weren't small.

39:56.812 --> 40:01.192
- I was a king.
- You were a God king.

40:02.735 --> 40:04.945
You were God of the sun,

40:05.112 --> 40:09.033
of luck, of craft, art,

40:09.617 --> 40:12.495
of everything valuable
to civilization.

40:12.661 --> 40:15.456
The shining one,
they called you.

40:16.457 --> 40:19.001
You saved your people from
their old enemy, the Fomorians.

40:21.170 --> 40:23.255
Lamfada, they called you.

40:23.422 --> 40:24.799
Long-hand.

40:24.965 --> 40:27.093
For your skill with your spear.

40:59.333 --> 41:01.877
You had fight in you
when they needed to fight.

41:04.088 --> 41:06.674
Because of you, they survived.

41:18.310 --> 41:21.564
Where the Tuatha de Danann
were scientists and artists,

41:21.730 --> 41:23.691
the Fomorians were madmen.

41:23.858 --> 41:26.110
Monstrous beings that came
from under the sea,

41:26.277 --> 41:28.529
under the ground,
under the surface of things.

41:28.696 --> 41:30.531
Nightmares.

41:31.574 --> 41:34.660
I remember now.
The madness.

41:35.703 --> 41:38.706
- It came from him.
- Your father's father.

41:38.873 --> 41:41.250
One-eyed Balor
of the Fomorians.

41:42.209 --> 41:44.003
I don't wanna
remember this story.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.347
I didn't wanna kill him.

41:55.514 --> 41:59.185
He loved me.
He cared for me.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.270
No, that's not right.
Balor?

42:01.437 --> 42:03.898
He tried to kill you.

42:04.064 --> 42:06.192
He heard prophecy that
his grandson would kill him.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.360
So he rounded up
all his grandchildren

42:08.527 --> 42:10.571
and drowned them all
in the lake.

42:10.738 --> 42:14.950
But you survived.
Like you always do.

42:18.621 --> 42:21.290
No...
It wasn't Balor.

42:21.457 --> 42:24.543
This is wrong.
Stop writing.

42:38.641 --> 42:40.184
It was Grimnir.

42:42.186 --> 42:43.520
It was Grimnir.

42:46.523 --> 42:48.400
Don't you remember...

42:49.610 --> 42:51.278
...what I said about the truth?

42:52.655 --> 42:55.282
Stories are truer
than the truth.

43:10.130 --> 43:11.590
What's this for?

43:13.842 --> 43:15.678
I was gonna
spend it on whiskey.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.805
Or a ride
outta this place.

43:19.807 --> 43:21.433
You might want
those things tomorrow.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.185
Don't need it.

43:24.228 --> 43:26.480
Consider it payment
for drinkin' all your beer.

43:30.234 --> 43:32.236
You're not thinking
about tomorrow?

43:34.446 --> 43:36.740
That ain't none
a your fuckin' business.

43:53.549 --> 43:55.050
Thanks.

44:06.979 --> 44:09.940
A toast to the crying ladies
on the porch,

44:10.107 --> 44:12.067
for leaving us their leftovers,

44:12.234 --> 44:14.653
and to their husband for dying

44:14.820 --> 44:17.489
and giving them the occasion.
And for all of you...

44:19.033 --> 44:20.993
...for keeping me company
in the coming war.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.204
Uh, we don't do toasts in Egypt.

44:24.371 --> 44:27.207
Yes, it's not appropriate
in Islam either.

44:27.374 --> 44:29.752
But I can echo your sentiment.

44:29.918 --> 44:32.004
Well, I thank you
for that, then.

44:33.505 --> 44:37.134
Sometimes amazed
we can sit at the same table.

44:38.552 --> 44:41.638
Let us enjoy this moment
while we can.

44:41.805 --> 44:45.184
My presence back on earth here
has been felt by old and new.

44:45.351 --> 44:48.228
Gungnir is whole again;
Yggdrasil has grown up,

44:48.395 --> 44:52.107
which means... the proverbial
shit is about to hit the fan

44:52.274 --> 44:56.278
and this is our proverbial
Last Supper. Hm?

44:57.571 --> 45:00.240
Are we ready? I am.

45:02.576 --> 45:05.037
A compact then. To war
or the end of the world, huh?

45:05.204 --> 45:07.122
Ah, surprise, surprise.

45:07.289 --> 45:09.458
Somebody forgot
to call me down to dinner.

45:09.625 --> 45:12.044
Nobody's stopping you
drawing up a chair.

45:13.128 --> 45:15.297
Except for the fact that
there's no more fuckin' chairs.

45:15.798 --> 45:18.384
I'm feeling a bit like
the 13th fairy, I have to say.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.636
Ah, here, take my chair.

45:21.595 --> 45:25.015
Why all the long faces?
Banshees' wailing got you down?

45:25.933 --> 45:28.685
But you're eatin' their food.
That's good.

45:30.020 --> 45:32.022
Thought you would've
known better.

45:34.191 --> 45:36.527
You ever hear what happens
when you eat a fairy's food?

45:37.736 --> 45:39.530
You're in their debt now.

45:40.572 --> 45:42.449
Fuck the fairies.

45:42.616 --> 45:44.701
You gonna let him
talk about us like that?

45:46.745 --> 45:49.415
I didn't spoil your appetite,
did I, old man?

45:51.333 --> 45:53.043
Means I don't owe you anymore.

45:54.420 --> 45:57.381
Not a hair on my fuckin' arse.

46:01.718 --> 46:02.845
Don't.

46:03.011 --> 46:04.346
Get.

46:04.513 --> 46:06.557
In. The.

46:07.599 --> 46:09.476
Way.

46:11.979 --> 46:15.607
Let go of the spear.
It's between me and Wednesday.

46:20.446 --> 46:22.072
Can't do that.

46:23.615 --> 46:25.701
- Clear the room!
- Please, friends--

46:25.868 --> 46:27.578
No!

46:29.037 --> 46:30.873
Give him this.

46:37.921 --> 46:40.048
Made me a promise, Shadow.

46:41.592 --> 46:43.051
I made him a promise.

46:43.218 --> 46:44.720
Sweeney made a promise;

46:44.887 --> 46:46.805
Shadow made a promise,
Bilquis made a promise.

46:46.972 --> 46:49.141
We all make promises, huh?

46:49.308 --> 46:51.185
My promise to you is done.

46:51.351 --> 46:53.270
Debt cancelled, thanks
to all that potato salad

46:53.437 --> 46:56.148
you been shoving down
your fuckin' throat!

46:56.315 --> 46:59.401
If you know what's good for you,
you'll put the spear down.

46:59.568 --> 47:03.363
You'll leave, you'll never
look on any of us fucks again.

47:03.530 --> 47:07.451
No one's dyin' tonight, Sweeney.
Let go of the spear.

47:08.911 --> 47:10.787
No.

47:18.504 --> 47:20.422
I'm not gonna ask you again.

48:11.890 --> 48:13.684
Can you feel the poison?

48:16.937 --> 48:18.438
It's him.

48:19.773 --> 48:21.525
We're on the same side, Shadow.

48:24.403 --> 48:26.530
He's been lyin' to you
from the start.

48:26.697 --> 48:30.450
Oh, shut the fuck up!

48:31.535 --> 48:33.203
Your wife's car wreck?

48:34.246 --> 48:35.581
That was me.

48:37.374 --> 48:39.042
On Wednesday's orders.

48:45.841 --> 48:48.010
Why would he
kill Laura?

48:48.176 --> 48:51.722
He's using you, Shadow,
like he uses everybody.

48:57.269 --> 49:00.188
Leave. Now.

49:00.355 --> 49:02.065
Fuck you.

49:02.232 --> 49:04.151
Fuck me?

49:04.318 --> 49:05.527
Yeah, fuck you.

49:05.694 --> 49:07.487
Fuck me.

49:10.616 --> 49:12.159
I fucked her...

49:13.910 --> 49:15.787
...in New Orleans.

49:22.127 --> 49:24.755
That true? Huh?

49:29.760 --> 49:31.845
Aaah!

49:58.372 --> 49:59.956
I'm so sorry.

50:01.958 --> 50:05.545
You owe me a coin, Moon Shadow.

50:08.715 --> 50:10.759
What a waste.

50:10.926 --> 50:13.303
I would've given you
your battle.

50:13.470 --> 50:15.639
You were always my battle.

50:33.407 --> 50:37.202
Your spear is
the sun's treasure now,

50:37.369 --> 50:39.413
you one-eyed cunt.

50:52.217 --> 50:54.177
I used to be a king.
