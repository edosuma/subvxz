Why aren't you involved?

04:44.849 --> 04:46.416

the shooting.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.955
So stop talking,

05:03.999 --> 05:05.914
and track down that bad dope.

05:05.957 --> 05:09.744
- Okay, let's get to work.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.093
- That's my son.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.747

Let me see my baby.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.970

05:21.103 --> 05:23.540
- Same tox report for
all five DOAs.

05:23.584 --> 05:24.889
Heroin cut with battery acid.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.326
Really?

05:26.369 --> 05:27.631
- That means it's intentional.

05:27.675 --> 05:28.632
It means somebody's
trying to

05:28.676 --> 05:29.677
put bodies on the street.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.461
- Wait, so, is this business

05:31.505 --> 05:33.594
or is this some sicko
serial killer

05:33.637 --> 05:34.682
out here just trying
to kill people

05:34.725 --> 05:35.944
with dope instead of bullets?

05:35.987 --> 05:37.728
- Well, all five ODs

05:37.772 --> 05:39.077
are on the West Side between
Sacramento and California.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.078
It's confined to one area,

05:40.122 --> 05:41.384
which is a good thing.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.517
- Detectives found packets

05:43.560 --> 05:44.822
at three out of five locations.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.476
They all had the same logo:
a spider.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.348
- Yeah, well, maybe we
should call Voight,

05:48.391 --> 05:49.740
see if he can at least point us
in the right direction.

05:49.784 --> 05:50.785
- No. We can't.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.003
Hank's off the books until

05:52.047 --> 05:53.353
COPA's done with
the investigation.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.354
- Right, yeah, I know that, but

05:54.397 --> 05:55.442
there's five people dead

05:55.485 --> 05:56.486
and the clock's ticking, so...

05:56.530 --> 05:57.487
- Voight's not involved,

05:57.531 --> 05:58.706
you understand?

05:58.749 --> 06:00.011
He's been stripped.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.622
It's violation to
even talk to him

06:01.665 --> 06:04.712
about any of this.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.716
All right, talk to Narcotics.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.370
See who the shot-callers
are and who's supplying

06:10.413 --> 06:11.632
product with a spider logo.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.503
All these kids
copped somewhere.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.939
Hopefully that somewhere is
connected to the same corner.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.419
- I think they are.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.855
I ran the phones.
All five trace back

06:17.899 --> 06:19.509
to the same burner.
Gotta be the dealer.

06:19.553 --> 06:20.945
Pinged it, looks like
he's doing business

06:20.989 --> 06:23.600
on the corner of Sacramento
and Fillmore.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.515
- Okay.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.649
Here's what we're gonna do.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.390
- Dealer's name is
Andre Thompson,

06:30.433 --> 06:31.565
AKA Little Dre.

06:31.608 --> 06:32.870
5'9'', 135 pounds.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.437
19 years old, two priors.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.917
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think I got him.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.527
- Yeah.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.615
- He's working near
the southeast corner,

06:38.659 --> 06:40.051
you see that?

06:40.095 --> 06:43.751
Blue jacket.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I see him.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.713
So this Antonio thing.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.541
- I don't want to talk
about that.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.542
- He didn't see
the shooting, Ruzek.

06:52.586 --> 06:53.543
- Oh, my God.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.892
That doesn't matter.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.459
- Yeah, it matters.
- No, it doesn't.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.547
It doesn't matter.
Not in this situation,

06:57.591 --> 06:58.548
it doesn't.

06:58.592 --> 06:59.593
Not when the dead guy got

06:59.636 --> 07:01.551
exactly what he deserved.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.074
We're talking about the guy
who ordered the hit on Al.

07:03.118 --> 07:05.425
- I get it.
- No. Hey.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.774
Antonio was right that

07:06.817 --> 07:09.690
Voight's future hinges
on his word.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.910
He had the opportunity to back
up his brother and he didn't.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.651
And I don't know why.

07:14.695 --> 07:17.524
But he didn't, and that's
the end of the story.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.482
- End of your story, maybe.
- Hailey.

07:19.526 --> 07:20.831
- Look, what I'm saying is

07:20.875 --> 07:23.181
it's not as simple
as you make it sound.

07:23.225 --> 07:26.707
Just keep that in mind.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.537
- Found his jab.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.191
- Deflated basketball.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.890
It's in the shopping cart.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.936
- Jay, we're up with solid
eyes, ready to roll.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.808

neighborhood, homey.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.838
Okay, we got a phone number
and an address,

09:37.881 --> 09:40.231
8660 West 54th Street.

09:40.275 --> 09:43.757
- Let's go get this punk.
- Yeah.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.323
- We've got five dead
bodies, Jalen.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.108
- Make that six.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.197
Patrol just found her in
an alley off Lexington.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.981
Amy Moore, 19.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.070
Last number she dialed,
same as the other five--

09:53.114 --> 09:54.245
your boy, Andre.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.769
- Sorry, I don't
know no Andre.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.640
He's the
skinny black dude

09:57.684 --> 09:59.076
who works the corner of
Sacramento and Fillmore.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.817
You know, the one
you sell heroin to?

10:00.861 --> 10:02.645
The one who just called
'cause he lost his jab.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.081
- Y'all must have me
confused with someone else.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.256
Like, for real.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.606
I don't know nothing
about no dope.

10:06.649 --> 10:07.781
Nothing?

10:07.824 --> 10:09.304
- Yeah. Nothing.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.915
What's that?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.264
- We found that in
a hidden compartment

10:13.308 --> 10:15.310
in your passenger door.
- It's not mine.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.659
- Mm.
- Look, man.

10:16.703 --> 10:17.660
If you give up your supplier,

10:17.704 --> 10:19.096
you'll get out in five.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.402
- If you don't,
we're gonna charge you

10:20.445 --> 10:21.925
with narcotic-induced homicide

10:21.969 --> 10:24.711
and you die in prison.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.321
- So why don't you do
yourself a favor, Jalen?

10:26.364 --> 10:28.323
Start talking.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.152
- All right, sure thing.

10:31.195 --> 10:34.068
- Good.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.939
- But only after you
get on your knees

10:35.983 --> 10:39.160
and kiss my black ass.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.945
- Pass.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.947
But I'm sure you're gonna meet
some new friends in prison

10:43.991 --> 10:47.168
that are gonna be happy to
take you up on that offer.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.738
- He's laughing at us.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.914
There's people dying
and this kid's laughing.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.132
- He doesn't want to talk,

10:55.176 --> 10:57.308
there's nothing we can
do about it.

11:00.355 --> 11:07.362
♪

11:12.149 --> 11:13.455
- All right, I know you're
supposed to be on the bench--

11:13.498 --> 11:14.674
- I told you, Antonio
is in charge.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.110
- We got six dead.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.807
They're all under 20.
It's not even lunch yet.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.855
They found another one.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.470
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

11:28.513 --> 11:31.952
But this stays between us.
- Of course.

11:39.524 --> 11:39.699
.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.701
- All right, everybody.

11:41.744 --> 11:42.702
What else do we know
about Jalen?

11:42.745 --> 11:43.746
- Um, he's affiliated

11:43.790 --> 11:45.269
with the Black Tiger Posse,

11:45.313 --> 11:46.618
has two priors,
both drug-related.

11:46.662 --> 11:47.619
- Okay, so we work
this up and down.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.838
Burgess, Atwater,

11:48.882 --> 11:49.839
start with the kid
on the corner.

11:49.883 --> 11:50.840
Andre.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.276
Wave those homicides

11:52.320 --> 11:53.582
under his nose,
see if he bites.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.626
The rest of you
work your sources

11:54.670 --> 11:56.498
and find Jalen's suppliers.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.457
Who sold the product to him?
Who's behind the spider logo?

11:59.501 --> 12:01.416
And coordinate with Patrol.
I want them to put up fliers

12:01.459 --> 12:02.765
so that everyone
in the neighborhood

12:02.809 --> 12:03.853
knows what's going on
out there.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.814
We sure that's a good idea?

12:07.857 --> 12:10.207
Demand usually goes up
when ODs start happening

12:10.251 --> 12:12.470
because the junkies think that
the dope's super-charged.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.691
Put word out, that might
do more harm than good.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.475
- I get it, but it's better
to be transparent.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.825
This way the people decide
for themselves.

12:18.868 --> 12:22.654
- Right, even if it's gonna
kill more people?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.265
- Okay, let's go.

12:24.308 --> 12:27.268
We don't have much time.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.312
- All right, man.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.315
- Adam, hang back a sec.

12:39.715 --> 12:42.239
- Look.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.806
I know you're upset

12:43.850 --> 12:45.677
about Al.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.505
About Voight.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.333
But we got work to do here.

12:49.377 --> 12:52.946
So no more crap.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.643
- Whatever you say.

12:54.686 --> 12:57.515
You're the boss.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.743
- All right, I got
a name for you.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.310
Phil Gamble.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.615
Supplies the product
to all the black gangs

13:10.659 --> 13:11.747
this part of the West Side.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.273
I've never heard of him before.
- He's a pro.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.406
He minds his own business,
stays under the radar.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.800
- Why would someone like that
pump bad dope onto the streets?

13:20.843 --> 13:22.192
That doesn't seem
to make sense.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.411
- Well, that I don't know.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.542
What I do know,
he's the man

13:24.586 --> 13:25.805
behind the spider logo,

13:25.848 --> 13:27.284
which means he's involved,

13:27.328 --> 13:28.720
intentionally
or unintentionally.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.592
So talk to him, see if
you can catch him dirty.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.507
He owns a bar called
The Trick.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.465
- Copy that.
Hey, boss.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.554
This, ah...

13:36.598 --> 13:38.774
shooting investigation.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.384
You gonna be all right?

13:40.428 --> 13:42.430
You got an angle to play?

13:42.473 --> 13:43.561
- Yeah.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.912
It's called the truth.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.568
- I told you.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.266
I ain't got nothing to say.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.398
- We've got six kids
on a slab at the morgue

13:54.442 --> 13:55.747
because of your dope,
and you're gonna pull

13:55.791 --> 13:56.923
the "I got nothing
to say" card?

13:56.966 --> 13:59.577
What makes you say that?

13:59.621 --> 14:02.406
- Phil, it's being sold
in an area you control,

14:02.450 --> 14:05.409
and it's got your logo on it.

14:06.976 --> 14:10.632
- Very.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.418
- Come on, Phil.
What's going on here?

14:14.462 --> 14:16.290
Who's cutting your product
with battery acid?

14:16.333 --> 14:17.595
That doesn't happen
by accident.

14:17.639 --> 14:18.901
- Look, bro, it's clear

14:18.945 --> 14:20.555
you don't know what
we're talking about.

14:20.598 --> 14:21.773
So help us.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.384
Help us get this crap
off the street

14:23.427 --> 14:24.994
before it kills anybody else.

14:25.038 --> 14:28.345
And we can work out
some sort of deal, all right?

14:28.389 --> 14:31.305
But you got to help us now.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.702
- No.

14:37.746 --> 14:40.531
Like I said before...

14:40.575 --> 14:42.620
I ain't got nothing to say.

14:42.664 --> 14:46.320
Now it's best you leave...

14:46.363 --> 14:49.323
Officers.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.551
- No luck, man.

15:00.595 --> 15:01.813
Talked to a bunch of
low-level dealers.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.380
Kids, really, like 16, 17.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.642
They don't know anything.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.296
Did confiscate half
an ounce, though.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.645
- Yeah, we struck out too.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.386
Tried to squeeze this guy
named Gamble

15:09.430 --> 15:10.779
but he wasn't having it.

15:10.822 --> 15:11.867
Who the hell is he?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.347
- Word is he controls the spot

15:13.390 --> 15:14.391
where the hot loads
were being sold.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.523
But, like I said,

15:15.566 --> 15:17.003
he shot us down pretty quickly.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.962
- Yeah, he seemed more
confused than anything.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.659
Like he had no idea the ODs

15:21.703 --> 15:22.834
were connected to his dope.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.575
- How'd you hear about
this guy?

15:24.619 --> 15:26.316
- Uh, Adam's CI.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.665
- Yeah, I've got a source.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.753
He knows the area pretty good.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.494
- A source.
- Yeah.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.324
- No, not yet.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.982

give us good info--

we got six people dead.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.405

bodies on the street.

to review it?

35:23.295 --> 35:24.818
- You bet.

35:24.861 --> 35:27.386
It was...

35:27.429 --> 35:30.302
more ambiguous than I was
led to believe.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.130
- It's not ambiguous.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.915
He reached for his gun
so I shot him.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.265
- I'm not sure COPA would
agree with that...

35:37.309 --> 35:40.834
without my help.

35:40.877 --> 35:43.141
- It was a good shoot.
I don't need any help.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.317
- Don't be stupid.

35:45.360 --> 35:49.103
We all need help.

35:49.147 --> 35:55.936
- I guess it depends
on the cost.

35:55.979 --> 35:59.157
- I want you to support
Kelton for mayor.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.205

36:04.249 --> 36:06.338
to help solve cases in a hurry.

36:06.381 --> 36:08.209
Or...

36:08.253 --> 36:11.560
not in a hurry,
depending on the facts.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.041
Or the circumstances.

36:17.349 --> 36:19.481
- So you want me to be...

36:19.525 --> 36:21.614
- My friend.

36:27.315 --> 36:30.318
- I need something too.

36:33.887 --> 36:36.411
- A letter of exoneration

36:36.455 --> 36:38.544
for Alvin Olinsky.

36:38.587 --> 36:42.461
So his wife and child
can collect his pension.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.987
- That's a big ask.

36:47.030 --> 36:50.338
- That's my price

36:50.382 --> 36:54.212
