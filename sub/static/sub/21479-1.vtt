WEBVTT

00:06.214 --> 00:08.258
Previously on The 4400:

00:13.896 --> 00:13.896
RYLAND:

00:13.931 --> 00:15.307
All right, listen up, everyone.

00:15.342 --> 00:17.100
We're at DEFCON One.

00:17.065 --> 00:17.065
The comet.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.268
It's not a fly-by anymore.

00:18.303 --> 00:19.854
A comet cannot change course.

00:19.819 --> 00:19.819
This one has.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.271
Then it's not a comet.

00:22.780 --> 00:22.780
MAN:

00:22.815 --> 00:24.274
We're not sure what's happened.

00:24.309 --> 00:25.084
There appears to be

00:25.119 --> 00:25.860
something out there.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.625
The light is gone,

00:27.660 --> 00:27.660
and thousands of people

00:27.695 --> 00:31.031
have just suddenly appeared.

00:31.066 --> 00:33.367
Finding Shawn and figuring out

00:33.402 --> 00:33.402
what happened to our son,

00:33.437 --> 00:34.702
that is my job.

00:34.737 --> 00:35.303
Diana Skouris.

00:35.338 --> 00:35.870
Tom Baldwin.

00:35.905 --> 00:36.825
You two will be

00:36.860 --> 00:37.746
one of the teams

00:37.781 --> 00:38.327
that's responsible

00:38.362 --> 00:38.873
for investigating

00:38.908 --> 00:39.474
what happened

00:39.509 --> 00:40.040
to the returnees.

00:40.005 --> 00:40.005
RUTLEDGE:

00:40.040 --> 00:42.710
What about my parents?

00:42.745 --> 00:44.378
They're dead, aren't they?

00:44.413 --> 00:46.045
This is Maia Rutledge.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.965
She's eight years old,

00:48.000 --> 00:48.000
only she was born

00:48.035 --> 00:49.132
in 1938.

00:49.167 --> 00:50.801
No time has passed.

00:50.836 --> 00:54.095
Returnee 2117: Shawn Farrell.

00:54.130 --> 00:55.096
Uncle Tommy!

00:55.131 --> 00:56.139
Hi.

00:56.174 --> 00:57.098
He's all yours.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.183
Hey, what about Kyle?

00:58.218 --> 00:59.643
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.

00:59.678 --> 01:01.020
We're letting them go.

01:00.985 --> 01:00.985
SKOURIS:

01:01.020 --> 01:02.187
We're letting them go?

01:02.152 --> 01:02.152
RYLAND:

01:02.187 --> 01:03.313
We don't have

01:03.348 --> 01:03.789
a legal right

01:03.824 --> 01:04.230
to hold them.

01:04.266 --> 01:05.524
Hey, Mom, Dad!

01:05.524 --> 01:05.524
Shawn!

01:05.559 --> 01:06.483
Hey, buddy.

01:06.518 --> 01:07.484
Remember me?

01:07.519 --> 01:09.486
Nikki?

01:09.521 --> 01:11.071
I'm Richard.

01:11.071 --> 01:11.071
Lily.

01:11.106 --> 01:12.447
Lily Bonham from St. Louis?

01:12.482 --> 01:14.074
You knew my grandmother.

01:14.109 --> 01:15.072
Some of these people

01:15.107 --> 01:16.035
have no place to go

01:16.070 --> 01:17.786
and no families left.

01:16.000 --> 01:16.000
What the hell

01:16.035 --> 01:17.786
are you looking at?

01:17.821 --> 01:18.954
I used to live here.

01:18.989 --> 01:19.955
Heidi?

01:19.990 --> 01:20.956
Yeah.

01:20.991 --> 01:22.082
Heidi, it's Mommy.

01:22.117 --> 01:23.625
It's, uh, it's okay, sweetie.

01:23.660 --> 01:24.835
I got it.

01:24.870 --> 01:26.211
Brian.

01:26.246 --> 01:28.255
Lily.

01:28.290 --> 01:29.715
Elizabeth?

01:29.750 --> 01:31.050
Where have you been?

01:31.085 --> 01:33.343
Have you seen the place

01:33.343 --> 01:33.343
my wife is in?

01:33.378 --> 01:35.512
I need money... now!

02:08.169 --> 02:09.755
Tom?

02:09.789 --> 02:11.548
What are you doing here?

02:11.583 --> 02:12.758
Your phone is off.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.676
Ryland wants us to come in.

02:14.711 --> 02:15.677
What's up?

02:15.712 --> 02:16.320
There's been

02:16.355 --> 02:16.929
a murder.

02:16.964 --> 02:18.221
The police are holding

02:18.256 --> 02:21.516
one of the 4400.

02:30.901 --> 02:31.443
RYLAND:

02:31.478 --> 02:31.986
That's him.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.320
That's Orson Bailey.

02:33.355 --> 02:34.338
Bailey- some kind of

02:34.373 --> 02:35.322
businessman, right?

02:35.357 --> 02:36.281
Right.

02:36.316 --> 02:37.449
Life insurance?

02:37.449 --> 02:37.449
Yeah.

02:37.484 --> 02:38.280
Disappeared

02:38.315 --> 02:39.076
in the '70s.

02:39.111 --> 02:41.745
'79, declared dead

02:41.745 --> 02:41.745
in '86.

02:41.780 --> 02:42.430
Seattle police

02:42.465 --> 02:43.080
are holding him

02:43.115 --> 02:43.848
in connection

02:43.883 --> 02:44.581
with a homicide

02:44.616 --> 02:45.245
in Madison Park

02:45.280 --> 02:45.874
last night.

02:45.909 --> 02:46.725
Do they know he's

02:46.760 --> 02:47.133
one of the 4400?

02:47.168 --> 02:47.507
Bailey told them.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.670
That's why they called us.

02:49.705 --> 02:50.375
Well, I thought

02:50.410 --> 02:50.710
the returnees

02:50.745 --> 02:51.011
were told not to

02:51.046 --> 02:53.090
discuss their status.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.050
Well, we counsel them

02:55.050 --> 02:55.050
to avoid it

02:55.085 --> 02:56.760
if they possibly can,

02:56.795 --> 02:57.552
but, you know,

02:57.587 --> 02:57.966
we were talking

02:58.001 --> 02:58.345
job interviews

02:58.380 --> 02:59.513
and housing applications.

02:59.548 --> 03:00.931
There's not really

03:00.931 --> 03:00.931
a protocol

03:00.966 --> 03:02.641
for being questioned

03:02.676 --> 03:03.475
about a murder.

03:03.510 --> 03:03.909
You said holding,

03:03.944 --> 03:04.309
not charging.

03:04.344 --> 03:05.432
That's right. There are

03:05.467 --> 03:06.520
some conflicting reports

03:06.555 --> 03:08.730
about what actually went on

03:08.765 --> 03:08.765
at the crime scene.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.432
We'll check

03:09.467 --> 03:09.748
it out.

03:09.783 --> 03:10.030
Quietly.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.566
I don't want to be

03:11.601 --> 03:12.751
dodging microphones

03:12.786 --> 03:13.902
at the 6:00 news.

03:13.937 --> 03:15.570
Quietly it is.

03:15.605 --> 03:17.447
Diana?

03:20.408 --> 03:21.743
Hi, this is Linda.

03:21.778 --> 03:23.495
I can't take your call

03:23.495 --> 03:23.495
right now,

03:23.530 --> 03:25.039
but please leave me a message

03:25.074 --> 03:26.206
and I'll call you back.

03:26.241 --> 03:27.374
Linda, it's me again.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.587
You said we needed to talk,

03:32.622 --> 03:32.622
so pick up the phone.

03:32.657 --> 03:35.256
Linda, come on.

03:35.291 --> 03:36.775
All right,

03:36.810 --> 03:38.259
call me.

03:38.294 --> 03:38.840
Everything

03:38.875 --> 03:39.386
all right?

03:39.421 --> 03:40.283
Yeah, same old same old.

03:40.318 --> 03:41.145
Call me, don't call me.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.140
I wish she'd make up her mind.

03:43.175 --> 03:43.679
You know, I had

03:43.714 --> 03:44.183
a boyfriend once.

03:44.218 --> 03:45.184
Every time he'd tell...

03:45.219 --> 03:46.643
A boyfriend?

03:46.678 --> 03:47.244
Well, don't look

03:47.279 --> 03:47.811
so surprised.

03:49.028 --> 03:49.028
Yeah, anyway,

03:49.063 --> 03:50.981
the thing about this guy

03:51.016 --> 03:53.274
that used to drive...

03:53.274 --> 03:53.274
You can stop.

03:53.309 --> 03:54.609
I barely got started.

03:54.644 --> 03:56.153
All I'm saying is,

03:56.188 --> 03:57.275
you don't have to try

03:57.310 --> 03:58.363
to make me feel better.

03:58.398 --> 04:00.949
Well, it was more of an attempt

04:00.949 --> 04:00.949
at bonding

04:00.984 --> 04:02.868
via a shared similar experience.

04:02.903 --> 04:04.203
Can you open the door?

04:04.238 --> 04:06.872
How long did you go out

04:06.907 --> 04:08.102
with this guy?

04:08.137 --> 04:09.332
Nine months.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.667
Nine months?

04:10.667 --> 04:10.667
Mm-hmm.

04:10.702 --> 04:11.435
So, you're equating

04:11.470 --> 04:12.169
your nine months

04:12.204 --> 04:13.249
of dating with my 19

04:13.284 --> 04:14.295
years of marriage?

04:14.330 --> 04:16.005
Yeah, you're right.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.173
Okay, forget it.

04:17.209 --> 04:18.966
You want me to drive?

04:19.002 --> 04:20.468
What for?

04:20.503 --> 04:21.695
I don't know.

04:21.730 --> 04:22.888
So you can brood?

04:22.923 --> 04:25.265
Just get in.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.507
Look who floated in

04:59.542 --> 05:00.717
on a ball of light.

05:02.510 --> 05:03.971
Remember me, Farrell?

05:04.006 --> 05:05.013
Rossi.

05:05.048 --> 05:06.403
Hi.

05:06.438 --> 05:06.438
Well, it looks like

05:06.473 --> 05:08.976
the steroids finally kicked in.

05:10.053 --> 05:10.723
Funny man.

05:10.758 --> 05:11.394
Funny.

05:11.429 --> 05:12.267
Always did appreciate

05:12.302 --> 05:13.105
your sense of humor.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.482
Like that time you sold me

05:15.517 --> 05:15.517
those concert tickets

05:15.552 --> 05:16.247
right before

05:16.282 --> 05:16.942
you disappeared.

05:16.977 --> 05:18.026
To the Foo Fighters?

05:18.061 --> 05:19.861
How was the show?

05:19.896 --> 05:21.338
I wouldn't know; the

05:21.373 --> 05:22.077
cops were waiting for

05:22.112 --> 05:22.781
me when I showed up.

05:22.816 --> 05:25.492
Tickets were stolen, man.

05:25.527 --> 05:26.493
You got me arrested.

05:26.528 --> 05:27.011
You got arrested

05:27.046 --> 05:27.494
for stolen tickets?

05:27.529 --> 05:28.679
Yeah, I had five

05:28.714 --> 05:29.830
tabs of X on me.

05:29.865 --> 05:31.453
I had to pee into a cup

05:31.488 --> 05:32.264
once a week for two

05:32.299 --> 05:33.041
years because of you!

05:33.006 --> 05:33.006
Stop it!

05:33.041 --> 05:34.834
Hey, hey! Come on!

05:34.869 --> 05:36.749
Get off of him.

05:36.784 --> 05:37.707
This is between me

05:37.742 --> 05:38.630
and your brother.

05:38.665 --> 05:39.899
Yeah? Well, I'm making

05:39.934 --> 05:41.133
it between you and me.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.054
See you around, freak.

05:47.222 --> 05:47.868
Oh, by the way,

05:47.903 --> 05:48.515
how'd you like

05:48.550 --> 05:49.325
the new paint job

05:49.360 --> 05:50.100
on your ride?

05:59.151 --> 06:00.443
You okay?

06:02.154 --> 06:05.032
I'm fine.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.029
The security cameras

06:06.064 --> 06:06.992
caught everything.

06:07.027 --> 06:08.952
The guy definitely had

06:08.952 --> 06:08.952
a bug up his ass.

06:08.987 --> 06:11.412
Except, as far as we can tell,

06:11.377 --> 06:11.377
Kensington fell into all

06:11.412 --> 06:14.082
that glass and impaled himself.

06:14.117 --> 06:14.975
You've been through

06:15.010 --> 06:15.834
all the footage?

06:15.869 --> 06:16.977
Every scrap. Bailey never

06:17.012 --> 06:18.086
made it past the gate.

06:18.121 --> 06:20.172
Wait. Hold on a second.

06:20.207 --> 06:20.207
Did you see that?

06:26.345 --> 06:28.638
That's glass.

06:28.673 --> 06:30.224
Yeah.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.680
Something blew out

06:31.715 --> 06:32.408
the windows, but

06:32.443 --> 06:33.101
from the inside.

06:33.136 --> 06:34.349
Yeah, we're still trying

06:34.384 --> 06:35.562
to figure that one out.

06:35.527 --> 06:35.527
There was no

06:35.562 --> 06:37.064
seismic activity.

06:37.099 --> 06:39.107
No evidence of a bomb

06:39.142 --> 06:39.774
or a gas leak.

06:39.809 --> 06:40.125
And Bailey's

06:40.160 --> 06:40.441
not talking?

06:40.476 --> 06:42.401
We've sent half a dozen guys

06:42.401 --> 06:42.401
in there,

06:42.436 --> 06:45.488
but he hasn't given

06:45.453 --> 06:45.453
Look, I've been over

06:45.488 --> 06:48.491
and over this with you people.

06:48.526 --> 06:49.822
We're not the police.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.119
We're Homeland Security.

06:51.154 --> 06:52.996
Well, tell the bozos

06:52.996 --> 06:52.996
out there

06:53.031 --> 06:54.452
that I had nothing to do

06:54.487 --> 06:55.874
with what happened to Adam.

06:55.909 --> 06:56.538
Let's just go over

06:56.573 --> 06:57.167
your day again.

06:57.202 --> 06:58.335
You went to see

06:58.370 --> 06:58.998
Adam Kensington

06:59.033 --> 06:59.627
about a job,

06:59.662 --> 07:00.562
and even though

07:00.597 --> 07:01.462
your name is still

07:01.497 --> 07:04.423
on the company letterhead,

07:04.423 --> 07:04.423
he brushed you off.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.509
I know how that'd make me feel.

07:06.544 --> 07:08.845
I admit it, I was angry.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.973
I went to Adam's house to, uh...

07:13.308 --> 07:15.060
I don't know why I went,

07:15.095 --> 07:17.062
but I didn't kill him.

07:17.097 --> 07:19.106
Let me read you an e-mail

07:19.141 --> 07:20.332
Kensington sent

07:20.367 --> 07:21.524
his attorney

07:21.559 --> 07:22.525
after your visit.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.526
It's not important.

07:23.561 --> 07:24.778
Just a sec.

07:24.813 --> 07:25.671
"Bailey is making

07:25.706 --> 07:26.529
desperate claims

07:26.564 --> 07:27.318
"regarding his financial

07:27.353 --> 07:28.073
stake in the company.

07:28.038 --> 07:28.038
"He actually

07:28.073 --> 07:29.866
threatened to sue.

07:29.901 --> 07:30.634
"I don't think

07:30.669 --> 07:31.001
he realizes

07:31.036 --> 07:31.333
"that there are

07:31.368 --> 07:32.744
probably going to be

07:32.779 --> 07:33.491
"hundreds of lawsuits

07:33.526 --> 07:34.803
involving the 4400.

07:34.838 --> 07:35.442
"It'll take years.

07:35.477 --> 07:36.046
"The poor bastard,

07:36.081 --> 07:39.126
he really is a rather...

07:39.161 --> 07:40.460
pathetic case."

07:48.009 --> 07:50.095
I am not a lawyer,

07:50.130 --> 07:52.847
but I'm not an idiot either.

07:52.882 --> 07:55.058
You've had me here

07:55.058 --> 07:55.058
for 12 hours.

07:55.093 --> 07:56.726
Now, either you charge me

07:56.761 --> 07:58.270
with something...

08:01.148 --> 08:04.192
...or let me go.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.973
So, we're just going

08:14.008 --> 08:14.731
to let him walk, after

08:14.766 --> 08:15.092
what happened in there?

08:15.127 --> 08:15.419
Yeah, looks like it.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.414
But for future reference,

08:17.449 --> 08:20.041
if I ever want to play

08:20.041 --> 08:20.041
good cop/bad cop,

08:20.041 --> 08:20.041
I'll let you know.

08:20.076 --> 08:21.084
Which one do I get to be?

08:21.119 --> 08:22.752
This isn't a joke.

08:22.787 --> 08:23.979
There's a time

08:24.014 --> 08:24.593
to lean on a guy,

08:24.628 --> 08:25.172
and that wasn't it.

08:25.207 --> 08:26.298
You shut him down.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.757
Look, I'm sorry.

08:27.792 --> 08:29.464
But Bailey admitted he

08:29.499 --> 08:31.136
was angry with Kensington.

08:31.171 --> 08:32.346
He was at his house.

08:32.311 --> 08:32.311
I didn't say

08:32.346 --> 08:34.514
it was over, did I?

09:04.801 --> 09:04.801
Do you think

09:04.836 --> 09:07.381
they ever thought about me?

09:07.416 --> 09:09.216
Oh, sweetie!

09:09.251 --> 09:10.067
They were

09:10.102 --> 09:10.475
your parents.

09:10.510 --> 09:10.849
I am sure

09:10.884 --> 09:13.011
that they thought

09:13.046 --> 09:14.259
about you

09:14.294 --> 09:15.472
every day.

09:15.507 --> 09:16.386
Thanks for

09:16.421 --> 09:16.843
bringing

09:16.878 --> 09:17.265
me here.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.850
Oh!

09:18.885 --> 09:19.743
This place used

09:19.778 --> 09:20.601
to be so nice.

09:20.636 --> 09:22.896
Now the kids leave their

09:22.931 --> 09:22.931
garbage everywhere.

09:22.966 --> 09:23.723
Ah, it really

09:23.758 --> 09:24.481
is a shame.

09:24.516 --> 09:26.125
You don't have to worry.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.734
Crown Ridge is nice.

09:27.769 --> 09:30.195
Crown Ridge Cemetery?

09:30.230 --> 09:31.363
Yes.

09:31.398 --> 09:33.614
That's where you'll be.

09:33.649 --> 09:34.782
Be...?

09:34.817 --> 09:36.701
Be what?

09:38.619 --> 09:41.081
Buried.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.755
Kensington's a popular guy

09:48.755 --> 09:48.755
around here today.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.253
The whole staff's been through

09:50.288 --> 09:51.716
to look at the postmortem.

09:51.751 --> 09:53.427
Yeah, why's that?

09:53.462 --> 09:56.346
Well, he might have been

09:56.381 --> 09:57.023
a boring old suit

09:57.058 --> 09:57.701
when he was alive,

09:57.736 --> 09:58.396
but in death...

09:58.431 --> 09:59.057
he's a rock star.

09:59.092 --> 09:59.908
God, look

09:59.943 --> 10:00.725
at that!

10:00.760 --> 10:02.140
Those were his

10:02.175 --> 10:03.520
parietal bones?

10:03.555 --> 10:05.080
We've seen beating deaths in

10:05.115 --> 10:06.606
here as bad as you can imagine.

10:06.641 --> 10:07.708
Even the guy that jumped

10:07.743 --> 10:08.775
off the Space Needle

10:08.810 --> 10:09.835
and had to be brought

10:09.870 --> 10:10.860
to us in a garbage bag.

10:10.895 --> 10:12.796
But I have never seen a skull

10:12.831 --> 10:14.697
in this kind of shape before.

10:14.732 --> 10:17.617
Thousands of tiny little

10:17.652 --> 10:17.652
bone fragments...

10:17.687 --> 10:18.382
Kensington

10:18.417 --> 10:19.077
was impaled.

10:19.112 --> 10:20.304
Are you saying

10:20.339 --> 10:20.917
that's not

10:20.952 --> 10:21.496
how he died?

10:21.531 --> 10:22.452
Oh, that would

10:22.487 --> 10:23.373
have killed him,

10:23.408 --> 10:25.017
but he was already dead

10:25.052 --> 10:26.626
from a shattered skull.

10:37.005 --> 10:37.595
Hello?

10:37.630 --> 10:38.186
Hello.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.974
Is, uh... Lily there?

10:41.009 --> 10:42.100
Who?

10:42.135 --> 10:43.226
Is this Heidi?

10:43.261 --> 10:44.519
Yes.

10:44.554 --> 10:46.146
I'm Richard Tyler.

10:46.181 --> 10:48.398
A friend of your mother's.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.066
My mother's name is Carol.

10:50.101 --> 10:51.356
Are you sure you have

10:51.391 --> 10:52.611
the right number?

10:52.646 --> 10:54.613
This is the Moore residence,

10:54.613 --> 10:54.613
isn't it?

10:54.648 --> 10:55.947
Yeah, but there's no one

10:55.982 --> 10:57.782
named Lily here.

10:57.817 --> 10:59.451
Sorry.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.259
Well, I'm afraid

11:16.294 --> 11:17.344
I can't give you

11:17.379 --> 11:18.800
any medicine

11:18.835 --> 11:20.221
for the nausea.

11:20.256 --> 11:22.098
Why not?

11:22.133 --> 11:23.891
Because it wouldn't work.

11:23.926 --> 11:26.060
You're not sick, Lily.

11:26.095 --> 11:28.062
You're pregnant.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.108
That's impossible.

11:32.143 --> 11:34.277
The-the quarantine doctors

11:34.312 --> 11:34.312
would have told me.

11:34.242 --> 11:34.242
You said

11:34.277 --> 11:35.529
they gave you

11:35.564 --> 11:36.881
a full screening

11:36.916 --> 11:38.198
seven weeks ago.

11:38.233 --> 11:39.782
If you just conceived,

11:39.817 --> 11:41.618
it wouldn't have shown up

11:41.653 --> 11:42.327
in their tests.

11:42.362 --> 11:43.036
Conceived...?!

11:43.071 --> 11:44.717
When?

11:44.752 --> 11:44.752
I assume it happened

11:44.787 --> 11:47.874
right before you disappeared.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.127
But there's no mistake.

11:51.162 --> 11:53.963
You're definitely

11:53.998 --> 11:53.998
pregnant.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.510
Now, there's nothing

11:58.545 --> 11:59.886
to worry about.

11:59.921 --> 12:00.591
I would like to see

12:00.626 --> 12:01.262
you again next week,

12:01.297 --> 12:02.802
and you can get used

12:02.837 --> 12:04.307
to the information.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.153
Shawn!

12:17.188 --> 12:18.238
Hey.

12:18.273 --> 12:19.573
How you doing?

12:19.608 --> 12:20.907
Mm... good.

12:20.942 --> 12:21.428
What's up?

12:21.463 --> 12:21.914
You get

12:21.949 --> 12:23.702
your car fixed?

12:23.737 --> 12:24.952
It's going to be

12:24.917 --> 12:24.917
in the shop

12:24.952 --> 12:26.621
for about a week.

12:26.656 --> 12:28.873
Yeah. You know, Danny

12:28.873 --> 12:28.873
and I are going

12:28.908 --> 12:30.309
to a party tonight at

12:30.344 --> 12:31.710
Eddie Tobin's house.

12:31.745 --> 12:33.961
You should come.

12:33.996 --> 12:35.505
I don't think so.

12:35.540 --> 12:37.090
Why not?

12:37.125 --> 12:38.901
Um, well, they're going

12:38.936 --> 12:40.677
to be listening to music

12:40.712 --> 12:42.053
I've never listened to,

12:42.088 --> 12:43.155
talking about movies

12:43.190 --> 12:44.222
I've never seen.

12:44.257 --> 12:45.515
School is bad enough.

12:45.550 --> 12:47.808
Partying with a bunch

12:47.808 --> 12:47.808
of runts from...

12:47.843 --> 12:50.103
Is that how you saw me,

12:50.138 --> 12:50.138
a runt?

12:53.189 --> 12:54.773
You were 14, Nikki.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.276
And now?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.950
I'm late for class.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.605
Where's my wife?

13:36.197 --> 13:36.197
My wife,

13:36.232 --> 13:37.651
where is she?

13:37.686 --> 13:40.027
Mr. Bailey, you have our deepest

13:40.062 --> 13:40.062
condolences.

13:40.097 --> 13:41.112
What?

13:41.147 --> 13:42.196
We called your hotel room,

13:42.231 --> 13:42.735
there was

13:42.770 --> 13:43.004
no answer.

13:43.039 --> 13:43.239
Elizabeth?

13:43.274 --> 13:45.241
It was a pulmonary

13:45.276 --> 13:45.804
embolism,

13:45.839 --> 13:46.103
about 1:00

13:46.138 --> 13:46.367
this morning.

13:46.402 --> 13:47.868
We tried to revive her.

13:47.903 --> 13:48.869
No!

13:48.904 --> 13:49.408
A pulmonary

13:49.443 --> 13:49.912
embolism...

13:49.947 --> 13:51.038
Please, Mr. Bailey.

13:51.038 --> 13:51.038
Calm down.

13:51.073 --> 13:52.039
Don't tell me she's dead.

13:52.074 --> 13:52.578
Mr. Bailey,

13:52.613 --> 13:53.082
just calm down.

13:53.117 --> 13:54.976
She's all I have!

13:55.011 --> 13:56.835
Let go of me!

13:56.870 --> 13:58.296
No!

14:01.793 --> 14:02.801
No!

14:03.677 --> 14:05.386
Get away from me!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.288
So the red dots

14:32.323 --> 14:33.160
mark the spots where

14:33.195 --> 14:33.998
the American members

14:34.033 --> 14:36.167
of the 4400 originally lived.

14:36.202 --> 14:38.127
You mean the returnees.

14:38.162 --> 14:38.728
Not according

14:38.763 --> 14:39.295
to the press.

14:39.330 --> 14:41.464
It's the 4400.

14:41.429 --> 14:41.429
You know,

14:41.464 --> 14:43.341
you have to admit,

14:43.376 --> 14:44.634
it's a bit strange,

14:44.599 --> 14:44.599
a nice round

14:44.634 --> 14:46.927
number like that.

14:46.962 --> 14:48.342
I wonder if it has

14:48.377 --> 14:49.723
any significance.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.726
So you're saying that

14:52.761 --> 14:53.706
if 3,781 people

14:53.741 --> 14:54.686
had suddenly showed

14:54.721 --> 14:55.561
up that night,

14:55.596 --> 14:56.016
it wouldn't have

14:56.051 --> 14:56.437
been as strange?

14:56.402 --> 14:56.402
I'd say...

14:56.437 --> 14:59.065
slightly less strange.

14:59.030 --> 14:59.030
This, however,

14:59.065 --> 15:02.443
is downright weird.

15:02.408 --> 15:02.408
Here's where

15:02.443 --> 15:05.196
the 4400 are right now,

15:05.231 --> 15:06.193
two weeks after

15:06.228 --> 15:07.156
their release.

15:07.191 --> 15:08.616
65% are still in Seattle.

15:08.651 --> 15:10.326
They're just not going home.

15:10.361 --> 15:11.407
And none of them can come up

15:11.442 --> 15:12.453
with a good reason as to why.

15:12.488 --> 15:13.096
You think it

15:13.131 --> 15:13.705
means something?

15:13.740 --> 15:14.577
In the CDC,

15:14.612 --> 15:15.415
we'd call this

15:15.450 --> 15:19.335
a statistically significant

15:19.370 --> 15:19.370
disease cluster.

15:21.170 --> 15:21.858
Yeah, well,

15:21.893 --> 15:22.202
in the FBI,

15:22.237 --> 15:22.512
we'd call it

15:22.547 --> 15:24.924
a freaky coincidence.

15:24.959 --> 15:27.218
Well, I don't believe

15:27.253 --> 15:28.824
in coincidences.

15:28.859 --> 15:30.430
Disease clusters.

15:30.465 --> 15:32.390
I believe in those.

15:35.226 --> 15:35.831
What do you mean,

15:35.866 --> 15:36.436
you're pregnant?

15:36.471 --> 15:36.912
I just found out

15:36.947 --> 15:37.353
a few days ago.

15:37.388 --> 15:38.204
I don't

15:38.239 --> 15:39.021
understand.

15:39.056 --> 15:40.732
When you were disappeared,

15:40.767 --> 15:41.253
I'd been in New York

15:41.288 --> 15:41.775
for weeks studying

15:41.810 --> 15:41.810
for the bar.

15:41.845 --> 15:42.435
I can't

15:42.470 --> 15:43.025
explain it.

15:43.060 --> 15:43.605
I haven't been

15:43.640 --> 15:44.151
with anyone else.

15:44.186 --> 15:45.111
So what are we talking,

15:45.146 --> 15:46.529
immaculate conception?

15:46.564 --> 15:47.047
I don't know what

15:47.082 --> 15:47.530
we're talking about.

15:47.565 --> 15:49.198
I wish I did.

15:53.710 --> 15:53.710
You know,

15:53.745 --> 15:56.289
when you disappeared...

15:56.324 --> 15:57.724
I would have given

15:57.759 --> 15:59.125
anything in the world

15:59.160 --> 16:00.794
to talk to you again.

16:00.829 --> 16:01.520
I had whole

16:01.555 --> 16:02.211
conversations

16:02.246 --> 16:02.896
with you

16:02.931 --> 16:03.546
in my head.

16:03.581 --> 16:06.966
I missed you so much, Lily.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.766
But we can't do this.

16:14.801 --> 16:16.222
I have another

16:16.257 --> 16:17.574
family now.

16:17.609 --> 16:17.609
And I'm sorry, I know

16:17.644 --> 16:20.271
that's not fair to you, but...

16:20.306 --> 16:21.039
Brian, I'm still

16:21.074 --> 16:21.773
part of your life,

16:21.808 --> 16:23.441
whether you want me

16:23.441 --> 16:23.441
to be or not.

16:23.476 --> 16:26.235
Lily, you haven't been a part of

16:26.270 --> 16:26.270
my life for 11 years.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.990
I want to see Heidi.

16:31.025 --> 16:33.952
I'm sorry, that's impossible.

16:33.987 --> 16:35.035
She's my daughter.

16:35.070 --> 16:36.370
She doesn't know that.

16:36.335 --> 16:36.335
She thinks

16:36.370 --> 16:39.081
that Carol is her mother.

16:39.116 --> 16:40.959
You never told her about me?

16:40.994 --> 16:41.622
She was a baby

16:41.657 --> 16:42.251
when you left.

16:42.286 --> 16:44.504
Hell, we were babies

16:44.539 --> 16:45.588
when you left.

16:45.623 --> 16:46.148
You can't stop me

16:46.183 --> 16:46.673
from seeing her.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.215
I already have.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.097
What is that?

16:55.062 --> 16:55.062
It's

16:55.097 --> 16:56.641
a temporary

16:56.676 --> 16:58.058
restraining order.

16:58.023 --> 16:58.023
Brian,

16:58.058 --> 17:00.520
I haven't done anything wrong.

17:00.485 --> 17:00.485
Lily,

17:00.520 --> 17:01.980
I'm a lawyer.

17:02.015 --> 17:03.314
I know how to work the system.

17:03.349 --> 17:04.773
Now, I don't want

17:04.809 --> 17:05.545
to use this,

17:05.579 --> 17:05.948
but I will if

17:05.983 --> 17:06.247
you force me to.

17:06.281 --> 17:06.281
My first priority has

17:06.317 --> 17:08.819
to be to protect my family.

17:08.855 --> 17:09.904
I am your family.

17:09.939 --> 17:10.693
I wish

17:10.728 --> 17:11.446
you were,

17:11.482 --> 17:13.156
but you're not.

17:13.192 --> 17:14.492
Not anymore.

17:14.527 --> 17:15.448
I'm sorry, Lil,

17:15.483 --> 17:16.368
I'm asking you,

17:16.404 --> 17:19.789
please, stay away from Heidi.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.792
And from me.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.969
I'm sorry, Lil.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.291
At first I thought

17:43.326 --> 17:44.146
it was an earthquake.

17:44.181 --> 17:46.232
Everything was shaking, falling

17:46.232 --> 17:46.232
off the walls.

17:46.267 --> 17:47.396
But then- I can't believe

17:47.431 --> 17:48.526
I'm going to say this-

17:48.561 --> 17:51.404
things started to fly

17:51.439 --> 17:52.467
around the room.

17:52.502 --> 17:53.531
Paper, chairs.

17:53.566 --> 17:55.157
What do you mean, fly?

17:55.192 --> 17:57.785
I mean fly, like it

17:57.785 --> 17:57.785
was a tornado.

17:57.820 --> 17:59.370
Except there was no wind.

17:59.405 --> 18:00.242
Everybody was screaming,

18:00.277 --> 18:01.080
Mr. Bailey was shouting.

18:01.045 --> 18:01.045
My head felt like

18:01.080 --> 18:03.958
it was going to burst.

18:03.993 --> 18:05.543
And then suddenly it was over.

18:05.578 --> 18:06.878
What about Bailey?

18:06.913 --> 18:08.128
Oh, he looked

18:08.128 --> 18:08.128
scared.

18:08.163 --> 18:09.589
Like the rest

18:09.554 --> 18:09.554
That's

18:09.589 --> 18:11.424
when he ran away.

18:11.389 --> 18:11.389
The staff...

18:11.424 --> 18:13.927
everyone's saying

18:13.962 --> 18:15.053
he's one of these people,

18:15.088 --> 18:16.888
the 4400.

18:16.923 --> 18:18.556
Is that true?

18:18.591 --> 18:20.140
Listen to me very carefully.

18:20.175 --> 18:20.804
You are not going

18:20.839 --> 18:21.434
to talk about this

18:21.469 --> 18:22.098
to the press

18:22.133 --> 18:22.727
or anyone else,

18:22.762 --> 18:23.474
and the same goes

18:23.509 --> 18:24.186
for your staff.

18:24.221 --> 18:25.142
If I pick up a paper

18:25.177 --> 18:26.064
and see a word of this

18:26.099 --> 18:27.607
or I see it reported

18:27.607 --> 18:27.607
on the news,

18:27.642 --> 18:28.500
I'm going to take an

18:28.535 --> 18:29.358
interest in this place.

18:29.323 --> 18:29.323
RYLAND:

18:29.358 --> 18:30.151
Things flying

18:30.186 --> 18:30.944
around the room.

18:30.979 --> 18:31.879
I know, but we got

18:31.914 --> 18:32.779
a half dozen witnesses

18:32.814 --> 18:33.821
all saying the same thing.

18:33.856 --> 18:35.281
Yeah, flying.

18:35.316 --> 18:36.991
I've got to do a briefing

18:36.991 --> 18:36.991
for Home Sec DC

18:37.026 --> 18:37.780
in the morning and I'm

18:37.815 --> 18:38.534
going to tell them what?

18:38.569 --> 18:39.285
Well, I'd go with

18:39.320 --> 18:40.001
"the incident is

18:40.036 --> 18:41.161
under investigation."

18:41.196 --> 18:42.246
Bailey checked out

18:42.281 --> 18:42.955
of his hotel

18:42.990 --> 18:43.327
after he left

18:43.362 --> 18:43.664
the nursing home.

18:43.699 --> 18:45.291
He could be on the run,

18:45.326 --> 18:45.326
we're not sure.

18:45.361 --> 18:46.375
Find him.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.835
You bought us some time,

18:47.870 --> 18:48.958
but this story's

18:48.993 --> 18:50.046
going to leak

18:50.081 --> 18:51.877
and I want Bailey in our

18:51.912 --> 18:53.674
hands before it does.

18:53.709 --> 18:54.734
So is calculus everything

18:54.769 --> 18:55.760
you remember it to be?

18:55.795 --> 18:57.929
Uh, you heard about

18:57.894 --> 18:57.894
Williamson and

18:57.929 --> 18:59.305
Ms. Sinclair, right?

18:59.340 --> 19:00.389
No.

19:00.424 --> 19:01.766
No?

19:01.801 --> 19:02.367
Oh, they found them in

19:02.402 --> 19:02.934
the janitor's closet.

19:02.969 --> 19:04.060
What is that?

19:04.095 --> 19:05.478
Making out, not dead.

19:05.513 --> 19:07.063
What?

19:07.098 --> 19:07.873
Everybody in school's

19:07.908 --> 19:08.648
been talking about it.

19:08.683 --> 19:10.024
Yo, freak.

19:10.059 --> 19:11.272
You still hiding behind

19:11.307 --> 19:12.485
your little brother?

19:15.321 --> 19:16.906
You know what,

19:16.906 --> 19:16.906
Brad?

19:16.941 --> 19:18.449
You need to shut it down.

19:18.484 --> 19:19.617
You want to shut me down?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.515
You know, the only thing I'm

19:22.550 --> 19:23.704
shutting down is you, bitch.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.083
You're really

19:27.083 --> 19:27.083
starting

19:27.118 --> 19:28.292
to piss me off now.

19:28.327 --> 19:29.961
Come on. Bring it.

19:29.996 --> 19:31.045
Shut me down.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.910
Let him go.

20:02.945 --> 20:03.574
NIKKI:

20:03.609 --> 20:04.203
Shawn!

20:13.427 --> 20:13.427
What did

20:13.462 --> 20:15.131
you do to him?

20:31.438 --> 20:32.210
I don't want her

20:32.245 --> 20:32.982
here anymore.

20:33.017 --> 20:35.026
Hey, keep your voice down,

20:35.061 --> 20:35.985
she'll hear you.

20:36.020 --> 20:36.482
It's bad enough

20:36.517 --> 20:36.944
she tells us

20:36.979 --> 20:37.816
we're going to be buried

20:37.851 --> 20:38.654
at Crown Ridge Cemetery,

20:38.689 --> 20:39.318
but the next day

20:39.353 --> 20:39.947
we get a brochure

20:39.982 --> 20:40.548
from the place

20:40.583 --> 20:41.115
in the mail?

20:41.150 --> 20:43.034
It's a coincidence.

20:43.069 --> 20:44.156
Look, she's not

20:44.191 --> 20:45.244
what we expected,

20:45.209 --> 20:45.209
so let's

20:45.244 --> 20:47.955
just talk to her.

20:48.873 --> 20:51.625
Yeah. I...

20:58.382 --> 21:00.009
Maia...

21:03.971 --> 21:05.431
It's okay.

21:05.466 --> 21:07.471
I knew I wasn't going

21:07.506 --> 21:09.476
to be here very long.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.982
Come on.

21:15.017 --> 21:16.275
Come on, let's go.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.152
Give me

21:18.187 --> 21:18.861
the ball.

21:21.572 --> 21:22.740
Your shot, space boy.

21:22.775 --> 21:24.951
What is your problem, Danny?

21:24.986 --> 21:26.035
What's my problem?

21:26.070 --> 21:27.203
Yeah, what's your problem?

21:28.996 --> 21:30.539
What'd you do to Brad?

21:30.504 --> 21:30.504
Come on, Danny.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.833
Not you, too. Come on.

21:32.868 --> 21:34.081
The way he went down,

21:34.116 --> 21:35.294
that's not normal.

21:35.329 --> 21:38.256
You know it, I know it,

21:38.291 --> 21:38.756
everybody saw it.

21:38.791 --> 21:39.257
What are you saying?

21:39.292 --> 21:41.134
You tell me.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.593
I didn't do anything to him,

21:42.628 --> 21:43.236
all right,

21:43.271 --> 21:43.844
Danny?

21:43.879 --> 21:45.471
Not a thing.

21:50.017 --> 21:50.934
And is this all that's

21:50.969 --> 21:51.852
left when you're done?

21:51.887 --> 21:54.354
I mean, poor Mrs. Bailey.

21:54.389 --> 21:56.190
It's a box of trinkets.

21:56.225 --> 21:57.188
They're not trinkets,

21:57.223 --> 21:58.151
they're memories.

21:58.116 --> 21:58.116
The kind

21:58.151 --> 22:00.069
you leave behind,

22:00.104 --> 22:01.025
you know, for your

22:01.060 --> 22:01.946
family and friends.

22:01.981 --> 22:02.922
I should get

22:02.957 --> 22:03.864
to work on that.

22:03.899 --> 22:06.075
I'm not going there.

22:06.040 --> 22:06.040
Well,

22:06.075 --> 22:08.077
believe it or not,

22:08.042 --> 22:08.042
some of us

22:08.077 --> 22:10.163
are happier alone.

22:10.198 --> 22:10.892
No one's happier alone.

22:10.927 --> 22:11.587
If they think that,

22:11.622 --> 22:13.958
they're kidding themselves.

22:13.923 --> 22:13.923
I thought you

22:13.958 --> 22:15.793
weren't going there.

22:15.828 --> 22:17.628
You see this?

22:17.663 --> 22:20.256
This looks promising.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.093
"Wyler Summer Cabin."

22:24.128 --> 22:26.137
Wyler was Elizabeth's

22:26.102 --> 22:26.102
Orson's panicking,

22:26.137 --> 22:28.764
he needs a place to run.

22:28.799 --> 22:30.074
Well, there's

22:30.109 --> 22:31.349
no address.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.351
We'll have to find one.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.238
It's better this way.

22:44.273 --> 22:46.032
For everyone.

22:46.067 --> 22:47.571
Everyone?

22:47.606 --> 22:49.076
Or just you?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.708
Maia, honey, you know

22:56.743 --> 22:58.376
this isn't about you.

22:58.411 --> 23:00.087
You are a wonderful girl.

23:00.122 --> 23:03.966
It's just, Kenneth and I,

23:04.001 --> 23:05.509
we just made a mistake.

23:05.544 --> 23:06.736
We're not ready

23:06.771 --> 23:07.928
to be parents yet.

23:07.963 --> 23:09.305
It's okay.

23:09.340 --> 23:13.017
No, it's not.

23:13.052 --> 23:14.452
But, sweetie, those

23:14.487 --> 23:15.853
things you say,

23:15.888 --> 23:17.580
they can scare people

23:17.615 --> 23:19.273
if you're not careful.

23:19.308 --> 23:21.483
Do you understand?

23:21.518 --> 23:24.237
Good.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.704
For you.

23:33.739 --> 23:36.165
Go ahead, take it.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.208
What is it?

23:37.243 --> 23:38.876
A CD I burned.

23:38.911 --> 23:40.269
Think of it as a crash course

23:40.304 --> 23:41.628
in all things new and cool.

23:41.663 --> 23:43.005
The Darkness,

23:43.040 --> 23:44.294
Handsome Boy,

23:44.329 --> 23:44.939
Modeling School,

23:44.974 --> 23:45.244
Killing Joke.

23:45.279 --> 23:45.514
All the bands

23:45.549 --> 23:46.926
you never heard of.

23:46.961 --> 23:48.594
Thank you. But, Nikki,

23:48.629 --> 23:50.930
I could listen to all the music

23:50.965 --> 23:52.160
and watch all the shows,

23:52.195 --> 23:53.391
but it wouldn't matter

23:53.426 --> 23:54.284
'cause they're still going to

23:54.319 --> 23:55.142
look at me like I'm different.

23:55.107 --> 23:55.107
At least

23:55.142 --> 23:56.643
you'll be listening

23:56.678 --> 23:57.811
to some good music.

23:57.846 --> 23:59.230
I don't understand.

23:59.265 --> 24:00.227
See, because everybody

24:00.262 --> 24:01.190
has been looking at me

24:01.225 --> 24:02.649
like I'm some kind of monster

24:02.684 --> 24:05.736
since the fight.

24:05.736 --> 24:05.736
But you...

24:05.771 --> 24:06.796
aren't you afraid

24:06.831 --> 24:07.821
to be seen with me?

24:07.856 --> 24:09.045
No.

24:09.080 --> 24:09.080
What do I care

24:09.115 --> 24:11.742
what those creeps think?

24:11.777 --> 24:13.911
If you like the CD,

24:13.946 --> 24:16.872
I'll burn you another one.

24:16.907 --> 24:17.599
Sounds great.

24:17.634 --> 24:18.291
All right.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.417
Okay.

24:19.452 --> 24:20.418
See you.

24:20.453 --> 24:21.585
I'll talk to you later.

24:21.620 --> 24:22.628
Okay.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.506
( children laughing

24:46.541 --> 24:48.028
and shouting )

25:08.417 --> 25:09.171
WOMAN:

25:09.206 --> 25:09.925
Hello?

25:12.893 --> 25:12.893
Okay, bring up

25:12.928 --> 25:16.432
the satellite shots.

25:16.467 --> 25:17.491
So we're looking

25:17.526 --> 25:18.516
for a small house

25:18.551 --> 25:19.431
with a north-

25:19.466 --> 25:20.311
facing exposure

25:20.346 --> 25:21.537
somewhere within

25:21.572 --> 25:22.150
the vicinity of

25:22.185 --> 25:22.729
Appleton Lake.

25:22.764 --> 25:24.315
If it's still standing.

25:24.280 --> 25:24.280
SKOURIS:

25:24.315 --> 25:27.567
No structures in grids one,

25:27.567 --> 25:27.567
two, three and nine.

25:27.602 --> 25:29.195
Four and seven each have one,

25:29.230 --> 25:30.612
but they're the wrong shape.

25:30.647 --> 25:32.031
Let's eliminate all those.

25:32.066 --> 25:33.115
That leaves us with

25:33.150 --> 25:34.532
five, six and eight.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.617
That's too small.

25:35.652 --> 25:36.677
That's the wrong

25:36.712 --> 25:37.703
orientation.

25:37.738 --> 25:38.951
That's too small,

25:38.986 --> 25:40.164
that's too big.

25:40.199 --> 25:41.290
Nothing but trees

25:41.290 --> 25:41.290
in eight.

25:41.325 --> 25:42.500
It's not there anymore.

25:42.535 --> 25:43.541
Hang on a second.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.961
Get in a little tighter on this.

25:45.996 --> 25:47.855
Well... it looks like

25:47.890 --> 25:49.715
it could be a house.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.549
No, this was taken

25:51.549 --> 25:51.549
50 years ago.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.469
These trees would be

25:53.504 --> 25:54.324
huge by now.

25:54.359 --> 25:55.179
Enlarge again.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.851
Bingo.

26:00.886 --> 26:02.478
There's your house.

26:02.513 --> 26:03.561
Bingo.

26:05.356 --> 26:08.317
Appleton's what, about 70 miles?

26:08.352 --> 26:10.027
Yeah.

26:10.062 --> 26:13.989
Look, when we get up there,

26:14.024 --> 26:14.024
I'll handle Bailey.

26:14.059 --> 26:15.408
All right.

26:15.443 --> 26:16.783
Are we leaning on him?

26:16.818 --> 26:17.993
No leaning.

26:18.028 --> 26:18.472
No problem.

26:18.507 --> 26:18.917
Excuse me.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.080
You Tom Baldwin?

26:21.115 --> 26:22.456
Yeah, who are you?

26:23.623 --> 26:25.418
You've been served.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.211
Sorry, man.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.215
You're getting sued?

26:35.719 --> 26:38.389
Linda's filed for divorce.

26:43.067 --> 26:43.067
BOY:

26:43.102 --> 26:44.853
Throw it over

26:44.888 --> 26:46.604
this way!

27:23.267 --> 27:24.851
Lily.

27:24.886 --> 27:26.662
Richard!

27:26.697 --> 27:28.439
Richard.

27:28.474 --> 27:30.107
Oh.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.027
I don't understand.

27:34.062 --> 27:35.671
I... I thought

27:35.706 --> 27:37.281
you went home.

27:37.316 --> 27:38.883
I did, but there was

27:38.918 --> 27:40.451
nothing there for me.

27:40.486 --> 27:41.659
But, uh...

27:41.694 --> 27:43.703
How did you find me here?

27:43.738 --> 27:45.789
Woodland Park, right?

27:45.824 --> 27:48.041
This is where you used

27:48.076 --> 27:48.076
to bring Heidi.

27:50.551 --> 27:50.551
Richard,

27:50.586 --> 27:52.796
it was terrible.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.259
Brian's remarried.

27:57.294 --> 27:59.553
Heidi doesn't know anything...

28:10.523 --> 28:12.483
Hello, Maia.

28:12.518 --> 28:14.234
Hello.

28:14.269 --> 28:15.544
Oh... I like

28:15.579 --> 28:16.182
it out here.

28:16.217 --> 28:16.785
It's much better

28:16.820 --> 28:21.492
than my stuffy office.

28:21.527 --> 28:23.243
But you didn't bring me

28:23.208 --> 28:23.208
to talk

28:23.243 --> 28:24.744
about the weather.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.956
You're a very smart

28:27.991 --> 28:29.270
little girl.

28:29.305 --> 28:30.584
Thank you.

28:30.619 --> 28:32.211
The thing is...

28:32.246 --> 28:34.105
that the Griffins didn't

28:34.140 --> 28:35.964
really give a reason

28:35.999 --> 28:38.133
why they brought you back.

28:38.098 --> 28:38.098
Maybe they

28:38.133 --> 28:41.679
didn't have a reason.

28:41.714 --> 28:44.431
Could be.

28:44.466 --> 28:46.517
Were they mean to you?

28:46.552 --> 28:49.019
No.

28:49.054 --> 28:50.479
Were you mean to them?

28:50.514 --> 28:54.608
No.

28:54.643 --> 28:55.960
Why do you think

28:55.995 --> 28:56.618
you're back here?

28:56.653 --> 28:57.242
I don't think

28:57.277 --> 29:00.155
they like kids much.

29:00.190 --> 29:02.782
Why do you say that?

29:02.817 --> 29:05.911
They brought me back

29:05.946 --> 29:05.946
and I'm a kid.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.667
You don't really want to tell me

29:11.702 --> 29:11.702
the reason, do you?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.837
That's okay.

29:15.872 --> 29:17.001
Maybe you'll change

29:17.036 --> 29:18.131
your mind one day.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.570
Maybe.

29:19.605 --> 29:20.974
WOMAN

29:21.009 --> 29:23.596
Hi, this is Linda.

29:23.561 --> 29:23.561
I can't take

29:23.596 --> 29:25.347
your call right now,

29:25.382 --> 29:27.641
but please leave me a message

29:27.676 --> 29:27.676
and I'll call you back.

29:29.024 --> 29:29.024
What,

29:29.059 --> 29:31.604
she's still not answering?

29:31.639 --> 29:34.106
Nope.

29:34.141 --> 29:35.982
Can I ask you a question?

29:36.017 --> 29:37.568
No.

29:37.603 --> 29:38.836
Well, I'm going

29:38.871 --> 29:40.070
to ask you anyway.

29:40.105 --> 29:42.361
So your son, how long

29:42.396 --> 29:44.617
has he been in a coma?

29:44.652 --> 29:47.494
Three years.

29:47.529 --> 29:49.079
That's a long time.

29:49.114 --> 29:51.164
You have no idea.

29:51.199 --> 29:53.204
Maybe you and your wife,

29:53.239 --> 29:55.210
you can work things out?

29:56.968 --> 29:56.968
You know, one day

29:57.003 --> 29:59.381
Kyle's going to wake up

29:59.416 --> 30:01.192
and I'll have to

30:01.227 --> 30:02.097
tell him his whole

30:02.132 --> 30:02.968
family's fallen apart.

30:02.933 --> 30:02.933
I go to that

30:02.968 --> 30:04.595
hospital every day

30:04.630 --> 30:05.968
and I tell myself that

30:06.003 --> 30:07.306
makes me a good father.

30:07.341 --> 30:08.032
Oh, you are

30:08.067 --> 30:08.378
a good father.

30:08.413 --> 30:08.689
Kyle's lucky

30:08.724 --> 30:12.144
to have a dad like you.

30:12.179 --> 30:14.187
Not everyone does.

30:14.222 --> 30:15.352
You can trust me,

30:15.387 --> 30:16.482
'cause I know.

30:21.111 --> 30:22.633
RICHARD:

30:22.668 --> 30:24.156
A baby?

30:24.191 --> 30:26.004
You sure?

30:26.039 --> 30:26.039
I had the doctors

30:26.074 --> 30:29.286
do the test three times.

30:29.321 --> 30:31.580
'Cause the thing is that Brian

30:31.615 --> 30:32.869
was out of town

30:32.904 --> 30:34.054
when I disappeared

30:34.089 --> 30:34.089
and I haven't been with

30:34.124 --> 30:37.753
anyone since I've been back.

30:37.788 --> 30:38.959
I don't understand it.

30:38.994 --> 30:40.130
How-how could you be...?

30:40.165 --> 30:41.214
I don't know.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.346
I'm sorry to be dumping this

30:47.311 --> 30:47.311
It doesn't...

30:47.346 --> 30:49.222
It's not really fair.

30:49.257 --> 30:52.184
It's okay.

30:52.219 --> 30:55.145
I want to help.

30:55.180 --> 30:59.692
There's some sort of connection

30:59.727 --> 30:59.727
between us, isn't there?

30:59.762 --> 31:01.443
I feel it.

31:01.478 --> 31:04.196
I can feel it, too.

31:04.231 --> 31:06.198
That's why I came back.

31:09.159 --> 31:13.288
But it's more complicated

31:13.288 --> 31:13.288
than that.

31:13.323 --> 31:14.935
Your grandmother and I,

31:14.970 --> 31:16.548
we weren't just friends,

31:16.583 --> 31:20.796
it was... it was more than that.

31:20.761 --> 31:20.761
We were going

31:20.796 --> 31:22.922
to start a family.

31:27.058 --> 31:27.058
I think part

31:27.093 --> 31:30.681
of me already knew that.

31:30.716 --> 31:34.518
The way you talk about her.

31:34.553 --> 31:37.479
The look in your eye.

31:37.514 --> 31:39.081
Here it is, I thought

31:39.116 --> 31:40.649
I was playing it so safe.

31:42.651 --> 31:45.278
It must have been difficult,

31:45.243 --> 31:45.243
a white woman

31:45.278 --> 31:48.198
and a black man in the '50s.

31:48.233 --> 31:49.258
Mmm. Black.

31:49.293 --> 31:50.283
Back then

31:50.318 --> 31:55.038
I was Negro, colored or worse.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.501
We didn't care.

31:59.536 --> 32:02.921
We figured after the war,

32:02.956 --> 32:04.757
we'd take off to some big city

32:04.722 --> 32:04.722
like Chicago

32:04.757 --> 32:11.096
or New York or Paris.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.224
But you never made it home.

32:14.259 --> 32:16.810
No.

32:16.845 --> 32:18.186
I never did.

Mr. Bailey, it's Tom Baldwin,

33:50.731 --> 33:50.731
Homeland Security.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.663
We met at the police

33:59.698 --> 34:00.226
station,

34:00.261 --> 34:00.789
remember?

34:00.824 --> 34:02.290
Mr. Bailey, we're here

34:02.325 --> 34:04.626
to help but you've got

34:04.661 --> 34:04.661
to talk to us.

34:04.696 --> 34:06.003
Go away.

34:06.038 --> 34:07.963
I'm afraid we can't do that.

34:07.928 --> 34:07.928
I just want

34:07.963 --> 34:09.715
to be left alone.

34:09.750 --> 34:11.341
I don't want to hurt anyone.

34:11.376 --> 34:14.260
That's good because we don't

34:14.295 --> 34:15.303
want anyone else hurt.

34:15.338 --> 34:16.346
If you leave, I promise

34:16.380 --> 34:17.281
no one will ever

34:17.315 --> 34:18.181
see me again.

34:18.216 --> 34:20.225
I'll just stay here...

34:20.225 --> 34:20.225
Listen to me...

34:20.260 --> 34:22.060
...away from everyone.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.078
We both know

34:23.112 --> 34:23.587
that's not going

34:23.621 --> 34:24.062
to work, Mr. Bailey.

34:24.097 --> 34:25.647
Now please, open the door.

34:25.612 --> 34:25.612
We can figure

34:25.647 --> 34:27.315
this out together.

34:27.350 --> 34:29.234
I'm on your side.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.652
No, you're not.

34:30.687 --> 34:31.820
No one is.

34:31.855 --> 34:33.279
My nephew, he's one

34:33.313 --> 34:33.926
of the 4400.

34:33.960 --> 34:34.248
Just like you.

34:34.284 --> 34:34.538
I've seen how

34:34.572 --> 34:36.574
hard it is for him.

34:36.610 --> 34:38.117
I know it's even harder for you.

34:38.152 --> 34:40.411
You don't know anything.

34:40.447 --> 34:42.121
My wife, she was

34:42.156 --> 34:43.665
everything to me.

34:43.699 --> 34:45.042
Believe me, I'm sorry

34:45.042 --> 34:45.042
for your loss.

34:45.077 --> 34:46.877
I don't want any pity

34:46.911 --> 34:47.356
out of you.

34:47.391 --> 34:47.835
Go away!

34:47.871 --> 34:49.128
I just want

34:49.163 --> 34:50.922
to be left alone.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.424
We can't do that.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.175
I said...

34:54.210 --> 34:57.888
get away from me.

35:07.564 --> 35:10.067
Stay away, please.

35:24.748 --> 35:25.832
Tom.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.001
Your nose.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.560
Hold on...

35:57.489 --> 36:00.033
I can't control it.

36:02.292 --> 36:02.292
Whatever it is you're

36:02.327 --> 36:05.122
doing, Mr. Bailey, stop it.

36:05.157 --> 36:06.999
I can't control it.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.708
Stop it now!

36:19.177 --> 36:20.553
You all right?

36:20.588 --> 36:22.139
Yeah.

36:27.686 --> 36:30.063
I'll call for an ambulance.

36:30.098 --> 36:31.230
Okay.

36:39.948 --> 36:41.992
We're going to get you

36:42.027 --> 36:44.036
some help, Mr. Bailey.

36:46.322 --> 36:48.915
Just don't die on me.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.964
Well, he's alive.

36:55.999 --> 36:57.775
But it doesn't look like

36:57.810 --> 36:59.551
he's going to be talking

36:59.551 --> 36:59.551
to us anytime soon.

36:59.586 --> 37:02.929
As far as the general public's

37:02.929 --> 37:02.929
concerned,

37:02.964 --> 37:05.098
we're going to deny it

37:05.133 --> 37:05.133
ever happened.

37:05.063 --> 37:05.063
Yeah,

37:05.098 --> 37:06.019
but we know better.

37:06.054 --> 37:06.940
The question is,

37:06.975 --> 37:08.601
will it happen again?

37:08.636 --> 37:10.187
So what do you suggest we do?

37:10.222 --> 37:11.163
Round them all up and put

37:11.198 --> 37:12.105
them back in quarantine?

37:12.140 --> 37:14.900
You saw what Bailey could do.

37:14.935 --> 37:17.736
I mean, you felt it...

37:17.736 --> 37:17.736
same as me.

37:17.771 --> 37:19.234
Who knows what the rest

37:19.269 --> 37:20.697
of them are capable of.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.575
I sure as hell don't.

37:23.540 --> 37:23.540
But then again,

37:23.575 --> 37:26.953
it's not my job to find out.

37:26.988 --> 37:28.997
It's yours.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.856
Aren't you glad

37:33.891 --> 37:35.212
you wanted back in?

37:49.184 --> 37:51.207
I never thanked you

37:51.242 --> 37:53.230
for saving my life.

37:53.265 --> 37:55.815
I never shot anyone before.

37:55.850 --> 37:56.666
But seeing him lying

37:56.701 --> 37:57.483
there like that...

37:57.518 --> 37:58.735
You going to be okay?

37:58.770 --> 37:59.715
Yeah, I'll get there.

37:59.750 --> 38:00.660
You know, I meant what

38:00.695 --> 38:03.322
I said to Ryland back there.

38:03.357 --> 38:05.909
If Orson can do those things,

38:05.944 --> 38:06.531
who knows where

38:06.566 --> 38:07.119
all this is going?

38:07.154 --> 38:08.954
So far we've got one case

38:08.989 --> 38:10.326
and maybe that's all

38:10.361 --> 38:11.664
we'll ever have.

38:11.699 --> 38:14.542
You ever noticed anything

38:14.542 --> 38:14.542
unusual with Shawn?

38:14.577 --> 38:16.461
Because I just need to know

38:16.496 --> 38:18.713
if you had, you'd tell me.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.719
There's nothing to tell.

38:32.679 --> 38:33.603
Wha...?

38:33.638 --> 38:35.647
Yeah, look at this guy.

38:35.682 --> 38:36.769
There's like three other

38:36.804 --> 38:37.857
sites just like this,

38:37.892 --> 38:38.980
but this one's got

38:39.015 --> 38:39.541
a lot more stuff

38:39.576 --> 38:40.068
than the other ones.

38:40.103 --> 38:41.486
What are you guys doing?

38:43.273 --> 38:44.656
Research.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.787
On The 4400 scoop.com?

38:50.822 --> 38:52.289
It's just...

38:52.324 --> 38:54.204
You know, the web, there's

38:54.239 --> 38:56.084
a site for everything.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.922
"The Forty-Four Hundred Menace"?

39:00.887 --> 39:00.887
I know this guy.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.966
I was in quarantine with him.

39:03.001 --> 39:06.094
They're saying he killed someone

39:06.129 --> 39:06.129
just by thinking about it.

39:10.307 --> 39:11.808
So that makes me

39:11.843 --> 39:13.601
some kind of freak?

39:13.636 --> 39:14.978
No. No, we were just...

39:15.013 --> 39:16.434
I want to know how you

39:16.469 --> 39:17.856
took Brad down so fast.

39:20.317 --> 39:23.111
Come on, he did something

39:23.111 --> 39:23.111
to him, you saw it.

39:23.146 --> 39:26.865
Danny, you have no idea what

39:26.900 --> 39:26.900
you're talking about.

39:30.118 --> 39:31.661
Neither do you.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.669
Shawn.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.091
What?

39:45.126 --> 39:46.151
You were thinking

39:46.186 --> 39:47.177
the same thing.
