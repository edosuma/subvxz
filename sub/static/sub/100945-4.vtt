WEBVTT

00:20.812 --> 00:22.022
There she is.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.315
Sleepyhead. Another late night?

00:24.733 --> 00:26.568
-Another early morning?
-You know what they say.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.986
Early bird catches the worm.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.821
Know what the night owl catches?

00:29.904 --> 00:32.032
- What?
-Rats.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.242
Yeah, well,
I'd rather eat a rat than a worm.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.746
Having tried both,
I think you would prefer the worms.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.165
Rats are very sinewy in texture.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.876
Worms go down quite easily. That's why I--

00:51.843 --> 00:55.513
That's why I call them
the spaghetti of the ground.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.558
Wow! Sounds crazy.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.518
Uh...

01:00.602 --> 01:02.854
you are going to clean up after yourself,
are you not?

01:04.272 --> 01:05.607
I have to go to school. I'm late.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.650
Hmm. Well, if you'd just gotten up
when your alarm went off,

01:07.734 --> 01:09.152
you wouldn't be late,
so clean up the counter.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.820
Jesus Christ, Dad. Get off my back.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.324
I want you to go over there
and wipe the counter

01:14.407 --> 01:16.993
because if you don't,
it's going to attract ants.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.871
It's really not that big a deal, okay?
Quit being such a bitch about it.

01:19.954 --> 01:22.957
Hey, hey, hey!
You do not talk to me that way.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.459
Yes, sir, General Naird.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.879
Get your keister in there
and clean the kitchen.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.506
That is a direct order.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.175
Damn it.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.094
<i>You're good with this, right?</i>
<i>You're okay with this?</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:35.720
Oh, he is not the father.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.014
Uh, Mallory's in your office.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.558
What's the point of a waiting area
if nobody waits?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.935
-Serious question.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.978
Oh, uh, also, FLOTUS's office called.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.898
The first lady has some thoughts
on Space Force uniforms.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.399
We have uniforms.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.610
Well, she thinks
they could use some refinement.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.028
-Handle it.
-Really?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.738
I don't know much about clothing design.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.073
No, make it go away.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.325
Your only job is to help me. So help me.

01:57.742 --> 01:58.785
I'll do my best, sir.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.120
Do my best.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.539
The last 20 seconds has reminded me
that your best is terrible.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.498
Understood.

02:03.581 --> 02:04.958
I doubt it.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.293
You're late.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.254
I have marital problems,

02:09.337 --> 02:11.673
teenager problems, FLOTUS problems.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.967
I don't have the bandwidth
for any more problems.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.719
-What do you want?
-The lunar habitat experiment.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.972
Mmm. Yes. Your moon tent.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.098
It's serious, Mark.

02:20.181 --> 02:23.184
If we can't prove
that we can live on the moon,

02:23.268 --> 02:25.520
then there is no moon base,
there is no Mars base.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.731
The lunar habitat experiment's
been going on two years.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.151
If it fails,
then the whole mission is set back

02:31.234 --> 02:32.569
by that amount of time.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.070
So what's the problem?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.323
Three spacemen and a civilian sculptor.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.117
Jesus. A sculptor? Why?

02:39.200 --> 02:43.538
The personality dynamics
are the subject of the experiment.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.499
The sculptor's humane creativity

02:46.583 --> 02:51.337
is meant to balance the rationality
of the astronauts,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.256
but now, one week left,

02:53.339 --> 02:54.382
one of them has gone...

02:54.465 --> 02:55.425
Don't say AWOL.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.260
-...mad.
-Thank God.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.221
-I bet it was the sculptor.
-Uh, actually, it wasn't.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.306
Okay, whatever.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.474
Let's just find someone else
and throw 'em in there.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.893
How hard can that be?

03:05.351 --> 03:06.394
It's not that easy.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.397
They had to be exhaustively tested

03:09.480 --> 03:11.733
-for psychological fitness.
-Mm-hmm.

03:11.816 --> 03:15.737
If we don't get a cool, calm,
collected presence in there stat,

03:15.820 --> 03:17.572
this experiment is doomed.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.575
Maybe the Navy can loan us
one of their submariners.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.744
They have a superior mental fitness.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.955
To be trapped underwater
with 100 men's farts,

03:26.456 --> 03:29.167
you have to be so strong.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.295
All right. I'll do it.

03:33.379 --> 03:36.341
Mark, though an amazing commander,

03:36.424 --> 03:39.594
you've had no psychological counseling
whatsoever.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.762
Oh, no need.

03:40.845 --> 03:41.930
My screws are tight.

03:42.388 --> 03:45.808
Sir, with all due respect,
you'd go to pieces.

03:46.809 --> 03:50.355
Dr. Chan, I have been chased through
the Bosnian woods

03:50.438 --> 03:51.814
by the entire Serb 3rd Army.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.901
I think that I can spend a week
in a plastic Motel 6.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.236
I'm gonna pack my bag.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.238
Tell my bunkmates
I'm headed to Crater Camp.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.322
Um...

03:59.822 --> 04:03.368
<i>♪ Crater Camp! I'm headed to Crater Camp ♪</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:24.639
Obviously, a uniform designed
by the first lady would be quite a coup,

04:24.722 --> 04:27.517
and I understand her desire
to support right-wing clothing designers

04:27.600 --> 04:28.893
-out of fairness...
-Is that the first lady?

04:28.977 --> 04:29.978
Let me talk to her real quick.

04:30.061 --> 04:33.731
Uh, I'm sorry. I have to put you on hold.
One of our rockets, uh,  did something.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.360
Go away. I'm not on with FLOTUS.
I'm on with her chief of staff.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.112
Oh, my sweet, innocent Brad.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.323
Chief of staff
is only one step away from FLOTUS,

04:42.407 --> 04:44.742
who's only one step away from POTUS.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.828
You gotta develop the relationship, bruh.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.162
Well, I don't know, bruh.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.247
Well, it's happening. Yoink.

04:49.330 --> 04:53.001
Hey, this is Space Force
head media manager F. Tony Scarapiducci.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.168
Who am I speaking with?

04:54.252 --> 04:56.296
<i>This is FLOTUS Chief of Staff</i>
<i>Evelyn Murray.</i>

04:56.379 --> 04:58.673
-Evvy! Evvy!
- No!

04:58.756 --> 05:00.466
-Stop that!
-Oh, this is so exciting.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.176
I can't tell you how thrilled we are

05:02.260 --> 05:05.179
that the first lady has shown interest
in our Space Force uniforms.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.974
But, of course, the process
of adapting our current uniforms

05:08.057 --> 05:10.268
is complex and close to impossible.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.479
However, doing the impossible, Evvy,
it's what we're all about.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.733
To clarify,
while we welcome the first lady's input,

05:16.816 --> 05:19.569
it is very important
that we manage expectations.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.031
Translation, tell her to send over
everything she's got. We cannot wait.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.533
I'm tingling. I'm actually tingling, Evvy.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.076
-I'll talk to you soon.

05:30.705 --> 05:31.622
Ha!

05:31.706 --> 05:32.915
What are you doing?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.709
Naird asked me to shut this down.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.170
And you also just punched a general.
That is not cool.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.464
One-star general.
Always say one-star general.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.506
I don't have to do that.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.008
Just follow my lead, okay, Brad?

05:42.425 --> 05:43.593
It's gonna be great.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.803
You know, I could use a little vacation.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.388
This is just what I need.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.057
It's no vacation, Mark.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.143
Relax. I got this.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.814
I am what used to be known in America
as a man.

05:57.690 --> 06:02.153
So let's take a make-believe trip
to the fake moon, right?

06:15.583 --> 06:18.169
<i>Decontamination process complete.</i>

06:18.252 --> 06:20.004
<i>You may now enter the habitat.</i>

06:32.892 --> 06:34.685
Wow. That is ripe.

06:37.980 --> 06:38.815
Hello?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.233
Hey.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.110
We're making dinner. Come join us.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.611
Hope you like potatoes.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.365
Well, I'm not much of a potato man myself.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.783
I like my starch in my collars.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.830
But you folks
have really doubled down on the potatoes.

06:54.372 --> 06:58.584
Say, looks like nice, rich soil here.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.836
Wow.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.213
Have you ever considered
growing asparagus?

07:02.296 --> 07:04.841
From moon dust fertilized with our feces?

07:05.425 --> 07:06.884
Oh, I never thought of that.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.805
Hey, gang, maybe we could have grown
pineapples and chocolate pies.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.517
You must be Major Jane Pike.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.979
Microbiologist,
winner of the Carlos J. Finlay prize.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.564
And now I grow potatoes.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.819
Well, I would maybe lead
with the prize thing.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.030
Captain Dave Powers, astronaut,

07:28.114 --> 07:30.074
six missions to the ISS. Very impressive.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.994
And yet here I am... with Jerome.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.497
Ah, yes. The sculptor.

07:36.873 --> 07:40.585
Have you sculpted anything
that I would be familiar with?

07:40.668 --> 07:44.130
Perhaps a national monument
or war memorial?

07:44.213 --> 07:46.674
I make giant phalluses out of sand.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.135
They're in the Native American Museum
in Taos.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.846
There's also one in the desert
right outside the base.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.265
I thought that was teenagers.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.144
Dave, I don't wanna give you
any unsolicited advice...

07:58.227 --> 08:00.438
-Then don't.
-...but your workstation is a mess,

08:00.521 --> 08:03.566
and how you do one thing
is how you do everything.

08:03.649 --> 08:08.112
There's a sticky film on top,
and, yeah, those are ants.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.363
You've got ants in there.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.323
No.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.450
Yes, I can clearly see ants right there.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.828
Well, that is impossible,
because there are no ants on the moon.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.332
I'd like you to clean it up.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.043
I don't take orders from you.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.878
We're all equals here.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.213
Except maybe new guy.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.548
General New Guy.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.761
Captain, Major, sculptor,
I would like you to clean this mess up.

08:31.844 --> 08:32.929
Immediately.

08:36.766 --> 08:37.767
Ten hut!

08:49.153 --> 08:50.071
<i>As you were.</i>

09:07.672 --> 09:08.589
Sick.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.717
Okay.

09:14.262 --> 09:18.724
Uh, hey, guys.<i> </i>My dad's away,

09:22.645 --> 09:24.188

Hey.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.570
I stopped singing.
You can stop that... ing.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.123
There's a treadmill for that.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.083
I prefer the open road.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.597
-What are you guys up to?
-Feelings survey.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.184
-What?
-I thought you said feelings survey.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.727
Yeah, it's for Mallory.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.438
It's a detailed diary
of everything that's bothering us.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.398
It's kind of the point of the whole thing.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.275
Like if we're upset that we can't sleep,

10:51.359 --> 10:54.278
and then we stay up
thinking about not being able to sleep,

10:54.362 --> 10:55.863
and that makes us stay up even longer.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.490
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

10:58.574 --> 10:59.742
You did not put that down.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.285
I did.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.578
That is not upset.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.164
Upset is getting your plane
shot out from under you.

11:05.247 --> 11:10.127
Upset is when a so-called smart bomb
misses the tank and hits a tour bus.

11:10.544 --> 11:11.545
That is upset.

11:11.629 --> 11:16.676
I will go out on a limb and say that
none of you have ever actually been upset.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.098
Gah!

11:22.890 --> 11:24.392
Goddamn it!

11:25.768 --> 11:27.353
Who put the tube on the track?

11:28.270 --> 11:29.480
You broke it.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.149
No, it still bears weight.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.401
Not your foot.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.819
My didgeridoo.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.405
Oh, stop talking baby talk.
You're a grown man.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.783
<i>This was my one personal item.</i>

11:41.575 --> 11:43.160
<i>Now I have nothing.</i>

11:43.244 --> 11:45.371
Well, maybe it would not have happened

11:45.454 --> 11:47.957
if any of you knew
how to keep an environment clean.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.086
I'll have you know that clutter
often goes hand in hand with creativity.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.879
Well, kudos.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.173
Both you and my child are very creative.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.553
Oh, my...

12:01.345 --> 12:02.972
There's no way to fix it?

12:04.056 --> 12:05.516
He's got issues.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.937
That's what I mean.
I think he did it on purpose.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.023
Why can't he just follow the rules
like everyone else?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.442
What seemed like an accident...

12:18.487 --> 12:19.488
Okay.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.825
Hey-- Oh.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.996
Twenty pies for Erin Naird.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.124
Am I at the wrong house?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.001
No. Just give them to me.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.091
Twenty pizzas is a lot of pizzas.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.343
Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thanks.

12:55.941 --> 12:56.942
<i>What are we missing?</i>

12:57.026 --> 12:58.527
-<i> Whipped cream.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

12:58.611 --> 13:00.279
We have to have whipped cream.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.198
-How's that?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.407
More, Daddy.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.993
More.<i> </i>All right. All right...

13:06.076 --> 13:08.204
Here's a little bit more then.
How about that?

13:08.287 --> 13:09.288
More, Daddy!

13:09.371 --> 13:11.165
I didn't expect that answer!

13:11.248 --> 13:12.208
There you go.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.461
-More, Daddy!
-Bah! All right!

13:15.544 --> 13:16.670
Let's eat.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.071
I heard him moaning,

13:42.154 --> 13:45.616
"Daddy will give you more cream,"
over and over.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.867
Ew.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.869
That dude just makes me uncomfortable.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.413
I don't know how I'm gonna get through
the next few days.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.917
Subject four
was supposed to balance the dynamic,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.253
but he's actually destabilizing it.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.547
Instead of a solid four-sided square,

13:59.630 --> 14:02.883
it's become a triangle of spite
against him.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.677
His blood pressure is spiking.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.597
And his bowel movements
have become miserly and unspontaneous.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.057
Damn it.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.853
A lifetime of military jackassery

14:13.936 --> 14:18.482
has taught him
to repress and displace everything.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.735
All this man does is eat his feelings.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.697
Who knows what he is holding inside.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.992
From the look of it, sir,
mostly mashed potatoes.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.078
Whoa...

14:32.788 --> 14:34.582
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd wear these.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.876
-Yeah, so would the <i>Greatest Showman.</i>
-Okay, you know what?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.628
The movie might have sucked,
but that soundtrack was fire.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.671
Yeah...

14:42.339 --> 14:44.049
It's FLOTUS's office.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.509
I'm ending this.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.138
General Gregory speaking.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.514
<i>Did you get the uniforms?</i>

14:50.598 --> 14:55.144
-Uh, yes, we did, and I have to, uh--
<i>-</i>Yes, yes, yes! And they were to die for.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.353
But as wonderful as they are,

14:56.437 --> 14:59.732
we do have some practical concerns
about functionality.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.317
<i>Have your troops tried them on?</i>

15:01.400 --> 15:02.902
-Well...
-Uh, no.  No.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.613
<i>Well, FLOTUS would like to see</i>
<i>some pictures of them in action.</i>

15:06.739 --> 15:07.907
Uh, let me think about that.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.951
We thought about it,
and, Evvy, we are all over that.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.454
All right, Cap'n,
show me what I wanna see.

15:13.537 --> 15:17.207
Ooh, 'kay. Now spin it.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.584
-Now pull it.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.668
-Now bop it.
-No.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.712
-Bap it!
-No. Why am I in a cape?

15:21.795 --> 15:23.672
I mean,
she knows we're not Avengers, right?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.591
How many buttons does a jacket need?

15:25.674 --> 15:27.760
By the time I get this on,
the war will be over.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.637
Why are all these seams
pointing to my wenis?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.221
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you Tommy Hilfiger?

15:31.805 --> 15:33.015
-What?
-No? Are you Hugo Boss?

15:33.098 --> 15:36.060
-Who?
-No? Then shut the fuck up and bap it.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.687
-Dude, I think he sewed them.
-No, I didn't sew them.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.065
-Did you sew them?
-No, I didn't, but the woman who did

15:41.148 --> 15:43.609
is an absolute genius
and has earned our respect,

15:43.692 --> 15:46.487
so please just pretend
like you're into it, okay?

15:46.570 --> 15:49.490
I'm sorry, I can't, because I'm actually
not that good of an actor. General.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.075
Hmm? I'm sorry.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.786
FLOTUS doesn't have the power
to force us to wear these.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.162
I don't think.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.416
I miss you.

15:59.917 --> 16:00.918
I miss you too.

16:01.835 --> 16:02.878
I like your...

16:03.754 --> 16:05.255
-Oh, the cornrows?
-Yeah.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.507
Oh, yeah, my roommate did it.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.260
Yeah. It's not appropriation
when they do it to you.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.387
Oh.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.138
How are you?

16:13.847 --> 16:15.891
How's school going?
Are you making new friends?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.394
I really miss DC.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.270
Yeah, I do too.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.772
Also, my freedom.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.942
But, honey, it's important to adapt.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.443
Try to fit in.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.737
-That's why I joined a gang.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.407
Did I say gang? I meant club.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.450
Basically, it's a book club. How's Daddy?

16:33.534 --> 16:34.576
Insane.

16:35.619 --> 16:39.206
He treats me like a total child
and then leaves me with a Post-it Note.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.125
"Bye. See you in a week.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.627
Going into the lunar habitat. Don't call."

16:44.795 --> 16:45.754
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.047
What's wrong with him?

16:47.506 --> 16:48.841
I don't know, really.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.968
And neither does he.

16:51.051 --> 16:55.097
You know, those top military guys,
they're too afraid to get into therapy

16:55.180 --> 16:58.183
because they can have
their security clearance taken away.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.184
Ah!

16:59.643 --> 17:02.730
Okay. Well, that explains a lot.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.647
But poor Daddy.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.608
A week away in a lunar habitat,
alone with his thoughts?

17:07.317 --> 17:10.904
I spent two days in solitary,
and it almost broke me.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.115
Wait. What?

17:13.198 --> 17:14.366
I did what I had to do.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.744
You take away my sourdough bread,
you're gonna get poisoned.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.412
-Time's up.
-Mom.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.623
He's probably feeling lonely too,
so you gotta be there for each other.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.125
Too?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.419
That hair is a cry for help.

17:25.502 --> 17:29.256
It's a cry for help,
just like Daddy's lunar habitat.

17:29.339 --> 17:32.634
-I prefer the brown hair. The brown hair!

17:38.724 --> 17:41.185
Sorry I'm late.
Nobody told me about dinner.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.313
It's all in the schedule.
Maybe get with the program.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.647
No problem.

17:47.441 --> 17:51.236
I'll just whip up a bit of the old...

17:52.696 --> 17:53.864
potato.

18:05.084 --> 18:05.959
God.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.557
Mark.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.600
Mark.

19:04.852 --> 19:05.686
Mark!

19:06.311 --> 19:08.522
Huh? What?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.358
- Hey.
-Huh?

19:11.859 --> 19:12.818
Are you okay?

19:14.945 --> 19:15.779
Yeah.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.783
Do you want some scotch?
I've got a swallow left.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.119
No, I'm good.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.245
All right.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.833
Well, uh, maybe just try
to scream slightly less?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.586
-Roger that.

I gotta go for a real run.
Work off some of this energy.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.137
Don't forget your space suit.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.181
You can't breathe on the moon.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.569
Turn back, Mark.
You're overheating.

20:37.653 --> 20:41.865
<i>Sweat is weakness leaving the body.</i>

20:42.324 --> 20:44.576
Your heart rate is quite high.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.620
And he still hasn't had a bowel movement.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.831
Go back to the habitat, Mark.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.834
I can't have this experiment fall apart

20:52.918 --> 20:55.170
because you're too stubborn to admit

20:55.254 --> 20:57.506
<i>that you weren't right for this mission.</i>

21:25.367 --> 21:27.244
- Brad?

21:29.371 --> 21:30.789
Brad, are you on the phone?

21:32.791 --> 21:34.376
-Brad!

21:34.459 --> 21:35.419
Go away.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.254
You better not be
making that phone call, Brad.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.922
I am. I'm ending this.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.633
Brad.<i> </i>Sweet Brad,
don't ruin this for us!

21:43.385 --> 21:45.679
<i> So, what do you think?</i>

21:46.263 --> 21:50.892
Uh, that's a great question.
You ask, uh, very good questions.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.185
<i>And the answer is?</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:55.772
Ma'am,
this is very difficult for me to say,

21:55.856 --> 22:00.068
but the uniforms,
well, they're just not working for us.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.779
I'm sorry, but, respectfully,

22:03.947 --> 22:05.490
we can't go in this direction.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.869
<i>Okay. We'll send some more options.</i>

22:10.037 --> 22:11.038
Sounds good.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.249
Come on, Brad!

22:23.592 --> 22:24.885
Get out of there, toad.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.563
He's alive.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.403
No, no, no. Don't get up. You're too weak.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.489
Ah... I'm not weak. You're weak.

22:45.781 --> 22:46.615
Oh.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.285
Here. Eat something.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.455
Mm.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.916
Sorry. Potatoes again.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.418
I've had worse.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.589
Rats. Worms.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.716
Rabbit when I got lucky.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.763
I've eaten bugs.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.724
Where'd you eat bugs, Mark?

23:12.808 --> 23:14.309
I don't know. Various places.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.561
Bosnia.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.233
I crash-landed in hostile territory.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.655
I was in the woods for ten days.

23:27.948 --> 23:28.907
On the run.

23:33.328 --> 23:34.287
Alone.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.542
You're not alone now.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.129
Let us help.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.973
And POTUS wants
boots on the moon by 2024.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.349
How's that even possible?

23:57.144 --> 23:58.103
I don't know.

24:00.021 --> 24:05.318
Plus, China and Russia are trying
to take out our internet every day.

24:05.861 --> 24:06.695
Mmm.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.738
People really like the internet.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.158
-They're always checking it.
- Yeah.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.367
Yeah. Yeah.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.869
And if I can't protect it...

24:15.579 --> 24:17.080
Well, that's a lot of stress.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.081
Yeah.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.252
My daughter and I fight constantly.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.880
Half the time, I don't even know
what we're fighting about.

24:26.047 --> 24:28.008
Well, what about your wife? Can she help?

24:30.218 --> 24:33.013
She's pretty much out of the equation.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.140
-Oh.
-I'm sorry.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.560
Have some more tea.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.187
Tea fixes everything.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.689
Oh. Thank you, Jerome.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.275
<i>Nutley, New Jersey.</i>

24:45.358 --> 24:49.070

<i>Yeah. Well...</i>

-Good night.
<i>-</i>Good night.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.487
Was that shit real
about the planet-killing laser?

25:31.738 --> 25:33.448
I'm just hoping it was a metaphor.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.033
Yeah. It's probably...

25:35.992 --> 25:37.118
probably a metaphor.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.078
Yeah.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.756
Mmm.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.582
Wow. What an adventure.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.334
I've only been here a week.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.337
I feel like I went to the moon.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.047
And beyond.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.257
You did, Mark.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.718
You took a trip inside your soul.

26:34.801 --> 26:38.388
Stared into a darkness
more empty than space itself.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.765
Ah, art.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.059
I'm glad you're here, Jerome.

26:43.518 --> 26:44.853
People need feelings.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.315
Shall we?

26:48.815 --> 26:50.358
Spacemen, let's head home.

27:51.086 --> 27:51.920
Hey, Brad.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.755
Oh, didn't expect you tonight.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.548
Anything happen
while I was gone?

27:55.632 --> 27:57.425
Uh, it was, uh, pretty uneventful.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.760
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

27:58.843 --> 27:59.886
How was the moon?

27:59.969 --> 28:02.013
It was good. Glad to be back.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.264
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.392
Uh, let's take the elevator.

28:05.475 --> 28:06.434
You're tired.

28:06.935 --> 28:07.769
Yeah.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.187
Here we go.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.695
You will get rid of those uniforms
by tomorrow.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.655
It's Fuck Tony.

28:18.738 --> 28:19.823
He's impossible.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.658
I did a great job while you were gone.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.869
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Bradley.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.580
Erin?

29:09.956 --> 29:10.915
Dad?

29:13.877 --> 29:14.711
Hey.

29:14.794 --> 29:15.670
Hey.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.467
Sorry about the mess.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.137
I got ice cream.

29:24.929 --> 29:25.889
You want some?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.100
Yeah, that sounds good.
