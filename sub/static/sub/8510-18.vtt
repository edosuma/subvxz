14:45.009 --> 14:48.052
So, you can't arrest the Douji guys, either?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.930
They should get gross
negligence and manslaughter,

14:51.015 --> 14:54.851
but since their weapons only got
out because of the earthquake,

14:54.935 --> 14:58.062
they're going to use the Special
Earthquake Act to wriggle out of it.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.816
So that's why you're in a rotten mood, huh?

16:55.347 --> 16:58.808
Lopping off a single branch won't kill a tree.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.310
Wadou-san is correct.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.940
Takayama...

18:54.007 --> 18:55.258
Yes.

18:55.342 --> 19:02.056
All Witchblade-related affairs
are now handled by my Bio-Section.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.185
Segawa-kun will continue to take
care of the business side of things.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.922
What about Rihoko-chan?

19:35.007 --> 19:40.761
I thought you would be the most
troubled if you severed ties with us...

19:40.846 --> 19:43.681
I am sure you have many feelings on the matter.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.526
Why are you still working?

23:23.610 --> 23:26.946
Have you already forgotten
about Takayama-san?

23:27.030 --> 23:32.535
You‘re definitely acting strange, Mom!
You‘re not your usual self!

23:32.619 --> 23:39.583
Say, Mom. Don‘t do any
bad work for my sake. Please.
