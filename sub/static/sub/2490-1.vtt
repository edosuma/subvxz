<i>Do you guys want to do it over there?
Do you wanna ...</i>

00:52.538 --> 00:54.805
<i>My representation is that we
move over here...</i>

00:54.889 --> 00:55.589
<i>Okay.</i>

00:55.590 --> 00:57.498
<i> Can we do it or not?</i>

00:57.499 --> 00:59.835
<i>No, not at the corner over there.</i>

00:59.836 --> 01:02.218
<i>The way the sun is right now,
will be really great.</i>

01:02.219 --> 01:04.447
<i>I mean, is there a way we
could face this direction...</i>

01:06.706 --> 01:09.860
<i>Do you have anything particular in
mind that you want to do this year?</i>

01:10.061 --> 01:11.374
<i>Don't ask me.</i>

01:11.375 --> 01:12.556
<i>Don't ask you, huh.</i>

01:13.401 --> 01:15.804
<i>Scott, you don't see
the swing set, do you?</i>

01:16.001 --> 01:19.338
<i>Do you see the swing set at all?
I don't want that, in front, at all.</i>

01:19.539 --> 01:21.581
<i>The swing, not at all.</i>

01:23.122 --> 01:26.653
<i>That doesn't look like
a life, kid, how about it? ...</i>

01:29.171 --> 01:31.124
<i>Hey again, do you
want to do the job, anyone?</i>

01:32.164 --> 01:35.413
<i>You're not gonna get the flash
in Keith's eye glasses are you?</i>

01:35.504 --> 01:38.481
<i>No. .. actually... </i>

01:47.357 --> 01:51.052
<i>I like when you're comfortable in that...
that's such a great shot.</i>

01:51.053 --> 01:53.880
<i>- I hate you.
- All right.</i>

01:54.281 --> 01:57.240
- Tell you what. Be comfortable, now.
- Because you're a natural.

02:49.182 --> 02:50.782
Hi!

02:51.387 --> 02:54.207
- What are you doing?
- Really boring work.

02:54.366 --> 02:56.212
Do you feel like
making us lunch instead?

02:56.966 --> 03:00.129
- What do you want?
- Um, tuna rolls.

03:00.684 --> 03:03.500
We will right outside,
near the arrival,

03:03.501 --> 03:05.636
right after she come
through passports changed.

03:07.009 --> 03:10.818
Ok . Yeah.
Yes, we have a piano.

03:11.305 --> 03:12.610
She gonna plays piano.

03:13.352 --> 03:18.690
Okay, great.
Okay, alright, bye-bye.

03:20.205 --> 03:24.012
- She's actually coming?
- Yes, she's actually coming.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.350
Coming in a couple of days .

03:27.715 --> 03:30.384
And the school is
week after next, so ...

03:31.515 --> 03:34.169
should be here, ready to go,
get everything in place.

03:35.112 --> 03:37.130
How to settle in,
should be enough time.

03:37.131 --> 03:39.083
You know I've got my
audition coming up, right.

03:39.084 --> 03:40.192
You'll be fine?

03:40.193 --> 03:41.639
I know my audition,
I've got to practice.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.253
You can still practice.
She's not going to disturb you.

03:44.632 --> 03:48.159
You can stay up in your room and
practice, you can practice at school,

03:48.160 --> 03:50.985
or you can practice out in the garage,
most of the places you can practice.

03:50.986 --> 03:52.041
It's not about ...

03:53.306 --> 03:55.385
Look, it's going to be great.

03:55.994 --> 03:58.351
And we're gonna be
very welcoming and kind.

03:58.554 --> 04:00.690
Are you going to be the
one babysitting or anything....

04:00.714 --> 04:03.184
You're not babysitting her,
she's not a child.

04:03.606 --> 04:05.605
She's actually older than
you by a couple of months.

04:05.606 --> 04:07.506
She is 18 already.

04:08.006 --> 04:09.591
It's a wonderful program.

04:09.592 --> 04:12.263
I am not gonna want to go away
from my final semester in high school.

04:12.298 --> 04:15.134
And Seebecks have a really
wonderful  student they got from France.

04:15.607 --> 04:16.612
He's from Paris.

04:16.613 --> 04:19.146
I'm just worried about the
stresses you have in your life,

04:19.147 --> 04:20.488
having to drive all of us around.

04:20.505 --> 04:22.605
There's no stress in my life.
I like driving everybody.

04:22.606 --> 04:24.946
Well, maybe I should .... get a car.

04:29.847 --> 04:31.870
I mean ... she can stay in my room.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.656
We got to get another car.

04:34.486 --> 04:37.328
We have a car.
We have a nice Jeep.

04:42.007 --> 04:45.914
Did any of you just sent out,
like a, an email for this letter.

04:47.238 --> 04:50.649
This shows...
that we care.

04:50.650 --> 04:52.844
- You got anything better than that?
- No.

04:53.726 --> 04:57.586
I mean, if I got into Stanford or Berkeley,
and especially if the offer is better...

04:57.887 --> 04:59.476
Yeah, exactly.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.805
Obviously I will work
really, really hard.

05:01.807 --> 05:04.731
And achieve swimming excellence.

05:05.050 --> 05:08.064
Gosh.  I'm  getting
very nervous now!

05:09.492 --> 05:11.638
- Just relax.
- Stop it.

05:13.565 --> 05:15.032
It's always getting over me.

05:17.647 --> 05:19.369
Stop. That's going over.

05:19.370 --> 05:20.985
Yeah, that is okay.

05:22.401 --> 05:24.824
Look at that.
Precision and skill.

05:25.025 --> 05:25.967
Good.

05:30.616 --> 05:31.566
Quack, quack.

05:32.907 --> 05:35.862
You wanna clean all this
up too before she comes?

05:35.897 --> 05:37.060
Yeah. I was going to.

05:37.743 --> 05:39.173
Hold on tight.

05:43.808 --> 05:46.181
Ok ... alright.
Now what about all this?

05:47.508 --> 05:48.822
I am going to do it later.

05:48.857 --> 05:50.883
No no... let's do it now.

05:56.108 --> 05:59.174
- Looks good.
- Thanks for sharing your room.

06:06.465 --> 06:07.916
This is your flight ?

06:11.518 --> 06:13.560
Oh yes, Sophie !

06:14.067 --> 06:15.090
Hi !

06:15.468 --> 06:16.409
Sophie.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.363
- Hello!
- Welcome.

06:19.127 --> 06:21.439
- How are you?
- I'm great. How are you feeling?

06:21.766 --> 06:22.842
This is Keith.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.818
Hi.
I 'm Sophie.

06:25.008 --> 06:26.809
- How was the flight ?
- Good, thank you.

06:27.204 --> 06:28.306
Very good.

06:29.628 --> 06:31.268
Wow ...
Okay.

06:32.408 --> 06:34.343
- How are you?
- Good, good !

06:36.609 --> 06:38.726
Have you been to
Manhattan before?

06:38.761 --> 06:39.717
No, I haven't.

06:39.779 --> 06:42.186
- You've never been to New York, right?
- Never.

06:43.409 --> 06:48.311
- How far are we from New York?
- By car, we need about an hour and a half.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.722
Keith goes in.
Just have snow ... right?

06:50.884 --> 06:52.133
Yeah. I'm the fastest.

06:53.694 --> 06:55.169
Here Keith's your piano teacher.

06:57.057 --> 06:58.812
- Oh, for the class.
- Yeah.

06:59.010 --> 07:02.849
Keith teaches piano and
then other than teaching

07:02.850 --> 07:04.612
he has a hobby
with the Symphony.

07:04.647 --> 07:07.093
- He plays with them...
- It's not a hobby.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.851
What do you call it?
A part-time job ?

07:11.886 --> 07:13.648
Yes, part-time job.

07:13.772 --> 07:15.054
Part-time job...

07:22.460 --> 07:25.359
- What's your instrument?
- I play cello.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.427
But I sub for ... the NYNSO.

07:30.094 --> 07:32.257
But if I'm auditioning so...

07:33.000 --> 07:36.219
there is a chair that is
supposedly bringing up soon.

07:37.461 --> 07:40.545
So would you give up teaching?

07:41.010 --> 07:42.010
Yeah..

07:42.910 --> 07:44.211
Nooo...

08:03.111 --> 08:04.477
Welcome !

08:04.941 --> 08:05.809
This is it!

08:12.611 --> 08:14.350
It's a little stuffy in here.

08:14.351 --> 08:16.325
Come on in.
I'll give you a little tour.

08:16.326 --> 08:17.226
Okay.

08:17.227 --> 08:18.327
This is a

08:19.231 --> 08:23.172
sitting room... and
oh, this is for you.

08:23.201 --> 08:25.838
- A treat.
- Thank you.

08:26.961 --> 08:29.761
This is a little guide, Sophie's guide.

08:29.796 --> 08:34.501
Just a little, you know
information, coffee shop.

08:35.095 --> 08:37.429
It's a map. Oh, this is the school.
This is the map of the school.

08:37.552 --> 08:40.011
All right, when school starts,
I'll pick everybody up.

08:40.361 --> 08:41.732
There's the family, now.

08:42.812 --> 08:47.638
And I collect cookie jars,
and there are ones that I sell.

08:47.870 --> 08:50.856
- Oh yeah...
- I find a lot of them online now.

08:51.282 --> 08:53.479
This is the only one in service.

08:53.711 --> 08:55.438
The rest are empty.

08:55.762 --> 08:58.011
Hey, don't tell Keith and Laurie,
they don't know.

08:58.012 --> 09:00.904
Thank you.
It's my secret stash.

09:47.933 --> 09:50.243
Would you like any lemonade or honey?

09:50.503 --> 09:53.362
- No thank you.
- You sure? How's the jet lag?

09:53.363 --> 09:54.262
It's fine.

09:54.313 --> 09:55.162
Ok...

11:34.115 --> 11:35.515
- Hi!
- Hi!

11:35.615 --> 11:37.770
- How are you?
- Okay thanks, how are you?

11:37.805 --> 11:40.081
- Good, I'm Lauren.
- I'm Sophie.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.141
Nice to meet you.

11:42.215 --> 11:45.525
- How was your flight?
- Yah, it was very easy.

11:45.717 --> 11:47.723
So where are you from?
Are you from London?

11:48.065 --> 11:49.674
I live in Barkshire.

11:49.935 --> 11:52.526
- So do you go into London a lot?
- Yup. Yeah.

11:52.527 --> 11:54.335
- Is it a cool city?
- It 's lovely.

11:54.534 --> 11:55.408
I've never been.

11:56.431 --> 11:58.779
So you're excited to be here for ...?

11:58.780 --> 12:01.366
Yeah! I guess. So much ...

12:02.048 --> 12:06.677
Yeah, I've been wanting to come
out to ... be in the States for ages.

12:06.896 --> 12:10.836
I've just been trying to think
about what I want to do and ...

12:11.982 --> 12:14.110
I guess I don't really know yet.

12:14.016 --> 12:15.415
Yeah...

12:15.515 --> 12:17.511
Um, do you do any sports?

12:17.935 --> 12:19.176
Nope...

12:19.316 --> 12:21.016
Well, I can swim, but not like you.

12:21.716 --> 12:22.755
Yeah...

12:23.948 --> 12:26.487
Oh, Keith play the guitar,
he was in a band.

12:27.684 --> 12:29.263
The Unconscious Brothers.

12:31.266 --> 12:33.598
- It's a brass band.
- It's a great name.

12:34.316 --> 12:37.676
- We got out of the garage.
- We got out of the garage but...

12:37.711 --> 12:39.730
I don't play with the
Unconscious Brothers any more.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.090
That would be...
I haven't quite decide yet...

12:47.716 --> 12:50.981
Anyway, in a couple of days we're
having one of the cookie jar expos.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.666
I have two more boxes that
are supposed to be coming.

12:53.766 --> 12:56.474
Two more cookie jars
or boxes of cookie jars?

12:56.816 --> 12:59.115
Two more boxes of cookie jars.

12:59.116 --> 13:01.120
How many cookie jars
are there in total?

13:01.066 --> 13:02.812
No, there's only seven.

13:02.813 --> 13:06.053
But anyway it's going to be
really busy ... with this one.

13:06.054 --> 13:08.960
So when you're free you just
roam around and you know ...

13:08.961 --> 13:10.061
Okay.

13:32.067 --> 13:34.326
Do you know what pieces
you're going to audition with?

13:35.205 --> 13:36.325
Huh?

13:37.153 --> 13:38.311
Sorry...

13:38.817 --> 13:42.412
- Don't want to disturb you.
- No, it's ok. I'm just taking a break.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.874
So do you get nervous?

13:48.472 --> 13:49.613
With what?

13:50.677 --> 13:53.327
- Before the audition.
- No.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.418
I mean...

13:56.698 --> 13:57.816
No, not really.

13:58.618 --> 14:00.706
You play long enough,
it doesn't affect you.

14:05.518 --> 14:09.459
Apparently Lawrence Olivier used
to vomit before every performance.

14:09.460 --> 14:10.906
Lawrence Olivier...

14:11.658 --> 14:13.212
Who told you that?

14:14.219 --> 14:19.500
Can't remember. But I guess the point is,
even the best of the best get nervous.

14:23.247 --> 14:24.451
Good night.

14:28.269 --> 14:29.338
Good night !

14:43.019 --> 14:45.282
- Hi!
- Hey! How are you. Nice to see you.

14:45.283 --> 14:45.860
Good.

14:46.058 --> 14:47.735
- Exchange student?
- Oh, yes.

14:47.736 --> 14:49.481
- This is Sophie.
- Sophie!

14:49.482 --> 14:50.313
<i>You know my family school?</i>

14:50.314 --> 14:52.182
Hi! Aaron.
Hi, nice to meet you Sophie.

14:53.215 --> 14:55.883
- How you enjoying yourself so far?
- Good.

14:56.218 --> 14:59.493
- You staying here for how long?
- For this semester.

14:59.519 --> 15:01.406
- The whole thing?
- Yeah.

15:01.619 --> 15:04.301
- We got to party!
- We will party!

15:05.319 --> 15:08.816
Yeah, but let's go early so that we can
get the sunset and making a bonfire there.

15:09.219 --> 15:10.869
Oh, it's going to be ....

15:16.419 --> 15:18.121
- Okay. Bye!
- Bye bye.

15:18.136 --> 15:19.490
- Nice meeting you !
- And you.

15:19.492 --> 15:21.127
See you later Sophie and Lauren!

15:21.936 --> 15:23.643
- That's Aaron...
- Yeah.

15:24.678 --> 15:29.976
- So... you guys going out?
- No... He's like a ...

15:30.800 --> 15:32.464
- friend.
- Yeah.

15:33.650 --> 15:34.724
Vanessa...

15:35.886 --> 15:37.399
Alexy, hello.

15:37.727 --> 15:39.430
Sophie Williams.

15:40.395 --> 15:44.419
Ha, you made it, you
decided to show up. That's ok.

15:45.813 --> 15:47.230
Sophie Williams.

15:51.102 --> 15:55.572
Back in school.
That's where we want to be.

15:57.020 --> 16:00.509
Oh, before we start, I'm playing
this evening with the NYNSO.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.719
As you know, I do
sometimes. I sub with them.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.790
So, anybody who wants
to feel more cultured

16:05.791 --> 16:08.031
or... wants to suck
up to the teacher.

16:08.870 --> 16:10.940
By all means feel
free to come along.

16:10.947 --> 16:13.632
If you bring a ticket stub
or, program or something

16:13.633 --> 16:15.861
then I know you've been
and you'll get extra points.

16:16.499 --> 16:18.055
We've been practicing.

16:20.561 --> 16:22.268
Chloe, why don't you go first?

16:25.747 --> 16:27.723
Let me guess,
something by Bach, right?

16:35.914 --> 16:36.913
Sophie !

16:37.516 --> 16:40.690
You missed my class.
Any reason for this?

16:40.691 --> 16:42.704
I'm not be taking your class, Sir.

16:42.839 --> 16:44.273
You're not going to take the class?

16:44.908 --> 16:46.002
Why not?

16:48.045 --> 16:50.184
I 've just been
thinking about that and ...

16:51.102 --> 16:54.760
I just don't think it's gonna
be the right thing for me to do.

16:54.761 --> 16:56.090
You just changed your mind.

16:56.591 --> 17:00.111
Ok, well look. You still need to come
until your name is taken off the roster.

17:00.112 --> 17:02.048
We have to talk to
Mr. Deacons, and get it arranged.

17:02.049 --> 17:03.297
We have to get your name taken off.

17:03.298 --> 17:07.229
I spoke with Mr Deacons this morning
and I made sure that it was okay.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.260
Well, you still need to come up until
he takes your name off the roster.

17:13.295 --> 17:15.856
Might take him a day or
two to get it arranged and ...

17:15.857 --> 17:17.646
He said it would be taken off tonight.

17:20.732 --> 17:23.647
He says a lot of things
that don't necessarily happen.

17:26.117 --> 17:28.336
Ok. If it's not arranged for tomorrow

17:28.337 --> 17:30.152
then just come to the class
and it'll be arranged soon.

17:30.153 --> 17:32.516
Ok. But if it's not, I'll wait.

17:33.352 --> 17:34.594
Don't be late.

18:26.423 --> 18:28.978
- So... what you just did...
- I'm sorry...

18:30.540 --> 18:33.444
Sorry ...
Megan and Lauren are waiting outside.

18:34.424 --> 18:36.389
Oh... I got to go.

18:37.623 --> 18:39.647
Your improvement is great.

18:39.682 --> 18:40.796
Well, thank you.

18:55.799 --> 19:00.557
Ok... well we just left.
Should you want to come by in 10?

19:00.826 --> 19:02.119
Ok...

19:02.334 --> 19:05.285
Come by in 10.
Perfect, thanks.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.338
Bye!

19:10.617 --> 19:14.340
- You sure you don't want to come?
- I think I might just stay here.

19:14.375 --> 19:20.350
Are you sure? There is like,
lots of drinking and a lovely bonfire.

19:21.688 --> 19:24.689
No... I think I'll just take it easy.

19:25.034 --> 19:27.639
Ok... Have a good
night with your book.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.121
Damon Culver.

19:29.474 --> 19:32.202
- What?
- It's the writer.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.637
- Bye!
- Bye Lauren.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.587
- Turkeys.
- Shall we?

19:46.588 --> 19:47.885
- How you doing?
- Good.

19:51.039 --> 19:54.162
- All right? It's this weekend, right?
- Yeah.

19:55.425 --> 19:56.552
If I turn up.

19:58.124 --> 20:03.705
I can remember my last audition,
with Barenboim, there's a haze of ...

20:03.706 --> 20:06.506
Well, that's the thing, I can't
remember mine, either. It was years ago.

20:06.841 --> 20:09.420
- You're not really worried, are you?
- No, no, no.

20:09.525 --> 20:11.155
- That would be foolish.
- I doubt I'll get 'em running.

20:11.189 --> 20:13.123
Keith, that would be foolish.

20:13.633 --> 20:15.873
Well, you know me on being foolish.

20:16.805 --> 20:18.032
It wouldn't be the first time.

20:34.430 --> 20:37.901
- Have you let them out yet?
- No, I haven't.

20:38.197 --> 20:41.111
- Are you being a good guest?
- I'm trying to be.

20:44.990 --> 20:49.267
It's kind of further out
from the city than I thought.

20:49.954 --> 20:54.018
Yeah...well. Perhaps with the ....
you would have found that out first.

20:54.069 --> 20:55.160
Yeah.

20:56.277 --> 20:57.735
Maybe...

20:58.734 --> 21:02.592
- You still want to be there, don't you?
- I don't know.

21:02.649 --> 21:04.336
<i>It's so nice.</i>

21:06.537 --> 21:09.483
<i>We've been round them,
well, there's so many times.</i>

21:10.084 --> 21:13.227
<i>You know what your uncle
will say, if he's still here.</i>

21:13.228 --> 21:16.135
<i>He'll say feel it, not the
thinking about it so much.</i>

21:16.736 --> 21:20.060
<i>Although I sometimes want to come
and just kidnap you and take you home</i>

21:20.061 --> 21:22.575
<i>because it's pretty bloody
quiet over here without you.</i>

21:23.176 --> 21:25.549
<i>Now, you are practising aren't you?</i>

21:25.593 --> 21:26.048
No...

21:26.049 --> 21:29.510
<i>Oh, Sophie.
Why not?</i>

21:29.811 --> 21:32.796
<i>Let me know how much,
I would have sent you.</i>

21:32.831 --> 21:35.138
Just don't know how I'm paying for.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.547
Anybody else? I know it's
a long way. Thanks for coming.

21:40.991 --> 21:41.984
Sophie.

21:42.945 --> 21:46.498
Everybody, this is Sophie Williams.
Make her welcome.

21:46.709 --> 21:47.664
and ...

21:47.760 --> 21:48.928
thanks for joining us.

21:52.139 --> 21:54.093
In fact, Sophie, why don't
you play something for us?

21:54.094 --> 21:56.940
as a way to introduce
yourself to the class.

22:04.661 --> 22:08.974
Just a way of ... saying hi.

22:10.340 --> 22:12.435
I just haven't
really prepared anything.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.460
It doesn't matter,
anything you like.

25:57.705 --> 26:00.781
- What is your name? Wendy.
- Yes

26:04.169 --> 26:05.997
Why are we going
down there again?

26:06.032 --> 26:07.581
To have a good time!

26:07.582 --> 26:10.017
They love you.
We're gonna have a good time.

26:12.156 --> 26:14.034
Hi!

26:14.069 --> 26:17.430
We just had it freshly
painted, so it smells a little.

26:18.477 --> 26:22.402
And we just had this. This was
a kind of an emerald green...

26:23.697 --> 26:29.520
- It's gorgeous.
- It does. We want to bring the ocean in.

26:34.651 --> 26:36.676
How long have you lived in your house?

26:37.615 --> 26:40.668
It's a ... sixteen years.

26:41.654 --> 26:44.085
- How long have you been married?
- Seventeen years.

26:46.720 --> 26:50.775
- Got a house, got married.
- Became a teacher.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.989
The house we could have passed out.

26:52.990 --> 26:55.782
I got that in foreclosure.
It was such a bargain.

26:55.848 --> 27:00.063
We would have stayed in the city,
but the house was so beautiful.

27:00.098 --> 27:02.622
Good for you, I mean everybody
we know is getting divorce.

27:02.680 --> 27:06.658
We have been to six divorce
parties in the past few months.

27:06.721 --> 27:09.429
It's a very nice
way of saying goodbye.

27:09.435 --> 27:14.254
And sometimes, the best man and the
maid honor come and they separate them,

27:14.292 --> 27:16.293
and you know she sounds beautiful.

27:16.294 --> 27:17.538
You're a good cook.

27:19.016 --> 27:21.422
I'm not, I was ...

27:21.551 --> 27:23.440
Well, I have a girl come
to the house once a week.

27:23.445 --> 27:25.496
She makes everything, we freeze it.

27:26.405 --> 27:30.164
- It's so simple...
- I have all these frozen squab.

27:37.833 --> 27:42.127
I heard you got a very attractive
young lady over there staying with you.

27:45.621 --> 27:46.844
How 's that going?

27:48.013 --> 27:49.434
She's cute.

27:50.187 --> 27:52.723
- Yeah, it's good.
- Ever make you think twice?

27:55.635 --> 27:57.955
Not that I'm looking, or ...

27:59.290 --> 28:01.716
It would be nice to be young again.

28:02.119 --> 28:04.765
- Honey are you ready?
- I'm starving !

28:04.548 --> 28:06.286
I know...  we're almost there.

28:06.992 --> 28:08.715
Eats like a horse!

28:10.883 --> 28:13.398
- Are you going to be alright?
- Yeah, I'm good.

28:13.433 --> 28:15.180
Hi Mark, I'm going to
take a look around.

28:15.181 --> 28:17.376
Yeah, walk around.
Make yourself at home.

28:37.996 --> 28:40.497
- Hey...
- Hey.

28:42.841 --> 28:44.634
He had to get away for a bit.

28:44.730 --> 28:46.579
Yeah...

28:48.888 --> 28:50.458
These are my favorite people.

28:59.117 --> 29:02.711
- Are you?
- Yeah. I'm just going to take my stuff.

29:04.536 --> 29:07.263
- I could have changed...
- No, it's okay.

29:08.259 --> 29:11.938
- Are we leaving soon?
- I think so.

29:46.588 --> 29:48.702
Why don't you go for a swim?
Go for a night swim.

29:50.572 --> 29:53.601
- Keep your clothes on !
- Oh, come on.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.831
- Should we take our clothes off?
- Yeah, why not, yeah!

30:03.866 --> 30:05.365
One more beer for that.

30:05.647 --> 30:07.003
Here we come.

30:32.258 --> 30:34.040
Oh! that's so pretty.

30:36.659 --> 30:38.882
Oh, that's really ...
I like clothes loose too.

30:41.748 --> 30:43.640
Oh cool!

30:45.892 --> 30:50.285
- That's great !
- It's a little toxic smelling.

30:51.857 --> 30:54.106
- I can smell something funny, though.
- It smells like rubber.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.212
- No it's a kind of ....
- It's something different.

30:56.213 --> 30:57.890
... like a new car smell.

30:59.514 --> 31:00.893
Is that what it is?

31:00.894 --> 31:02.953
Car ....

31:03.360 --> 31:05.787
Oh my God!
I can't catch him.

31:06.188 --> 31:08.505
Oh my God!

31:10.760 --> 31:13.048
Oh my God, it's a TV favourite !

31:14.714 --> 31:18.124
- What do you think?
- It's great. Yeah.

31:18.443 --> 31:19.996
Put the key.
Here. Put the key.

31:23.017 --> 31:25.011
Thank you Momma !

31:26.686 --> 31:28.505
- Sophie, you want to go?
- Yeah!

31:28.506 --> 31:29.813
- Ok, let's go.
- Ok.

31:29.814 --> 31:30.603
Where are you going to go?

31:30.672 --> 31:32.315
We gonna go meet my friends.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.634
- Goodbye !
- See you later.

31:58.698 --> 32:00.875
Lauren text it,
breath the rest of the way.

32:00.940 --> 32:03.340
- Where?
- By the school.

32:03.604 --> 32:06.948
- Oh... If.
- Oh no memory lane.

32:07.650 --> 32:09.913
It's too loud!
Turn it down.

32:09.914 --> 32:11.289
Too loud?
It's great!

32:11.290 --> 32:14.421
- Doesn't it sound great?
- No, you guys are so cute.

32:14.422 --> 32:15.296
We could still be cute.

32:15.297 --> 32:17.471
You gotta transfer these,
they gonna get ruined.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.670
- They all stretched out.
- Look at this. It's fine.

32:22.064 --> 32:25.601
- Exciting, wasn't it?
- What? Life with no money?

32:25.666 --> 32:27.557
Strangers working off our couch?

32:27.722 --> 32:29.157
- Yeah...
- No hot water?

32:29.722 --> 32:31.552
- Being creative.
- Cockroaches.

32:31.787 --> 32:33.142
- Being spontaneous.
- Noise.

32:33.177 --> 32:34.943
- Being inspired.
- Pre-science.

32:35.041 --> 32:36.046
Don't you think?

32:36.433 --> 32:39.338
Oh, honey every eight
months is the same old ...

32:39.339 --> 32:40.639
If I get the chair...

32:41.023 --> 32:44.616
I think we should think
about the city again.

32:47.714 --> 32:51.574
- I think it would be... inspirational.
- Even if that happens, we making more

32:51.575 --> 32:55.341
money, we still won't have
enough money to sell this house.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.121
I don't think you understand that stuff.

32:59.156 --> 33:01.923
Do you know how much
apartments go for right now?

33:01.967 --> 33:04.922
They are well over a million dollars.
A million dollars!

33:04.939 --> 33:09.041
We have to invest, I just think we need to
be able to have a conversation about it.

33:09.289 --> 33:12.709
I just think that we had
a life that was cut short.

33:12.710 --> 33:15.791
- Cause we had a baby, you call that cut short?
- Yeah, we had a baby.

33:15.710 --> 33:17.397
I thought we would be
expanding our lives.

33:17.398 --> 33:18.991
Sure, but she's not a baby anymore.

33:19.026 --> 33:21.144
She's gonna move out of home soon.

33:21.279 --> 33:25.709
We talked about the fact that when she was
old enough we could reconsider the city.

33:25.710 --> 33:27.532
Yeah, if we could afford it, we can't..

33:27.541 --> 33:29.841
This feel like we're
not even discussing it.

33:32.242 --> 33:35.933
Shouldn't you be practicing
for your audition tomorrow?

33:36.069 --> 33:37.383
Yeah..

33:38.942 --> 33:40.242
You should.

33:46.378 --> 33:50.221
Oh we're doing it for the birthday girl.
So wish her Happy Birthday.

33:50.411 --> 33:52.641
- Happy eighteen !
- Yeah..!

33:56.567 --> 33:57.842
Hey.

34:00.124 --> 34:01.677
- How 's it going?
- Okay.

34:02.308 --> 34:05.013
Could I pinch a cigarrette
from you, please?

34:05.248 --> 34:06.293
Of course.

34:06.801 --> 34:08.117
Thank you.

34:15.737 --> 34:18.293
- How's Lauren been?
- Great, yeah.

34:18.293 --> 34:19.031
Yeah, she's great.

34:19.032 --> 34:22.054
It's very nice of her to
give up half her bedroom.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.875
It's not like she's
giving up that much.

34:29.614 --> 34:31.688
You like living here?

34:31.849 --> 34:35.000
Yeah, I love being so close to the interstate.

34:35.235 --> 34:36.902
I go in all the time, so...

34:37.643 --> 34:41.487
I'd just like to go into Manhattan
at some point, I think.

34:45.641 --> 34:48.900
And you just met these
dudes the night before?

34:51.760 --> 34:55.108
Are you telling the story about how you
lost your maidenhead riding horseback?

34:55.143 --> 34:55.917
No!

34:56.052 --> 34:57.553
You're so gross!

34:58.641 --> 35:00.091
Okay.

35:04.859 --> 35:06.871
Do you think.. are you
going to be sick again?

35:06.872 --> 35:09.277
Do you think ...
what you wanna do?

35:16.519 --> 35:18.163
Are you feeling a bit better?

35:19.318 --> 35:21.090
Yeah, I just feel tired.

35:23.361 --> 35:25.092
Did you talk to Aaron tonight?

35:25.626 --> 35:27.479
I did, a little bit.

35:28.743 --> 35:30.708
Did you know that I had sex with him?

35:33.077 --> 35:35.781
- Did you lose your ...
- Yes.

35:37.446 --> 35:39.919
You should make sure
that he is nice to you.

35:40.517 --> 35:44.457
He told everybody that we had sex,
and he told me he wasn't going to.

35:44.492 --> 35:47.556
And now everybody thinks
I am a slut and I'm not.

35:47.644 --> 35:51.268
And I have like, not
even hook up with any guys.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.750
Are you a virgin?

35:59.944 --> 36:01.277
Nope.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.429
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:18.078 --> 36:19.655
How are you doing?

36:21.178 --> 36:22.304
Good.

36:25.345 --> 36:26.544
Nervous.

36:40.045 --> 36:41.445
Sit down.

36:45.408 --> 36:46.661
Why?

36:47.185 --> 36:49.044
Just sit down.

36:57.536 --> 36:58.943
Close your eyes.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.790
You have to take off your glasses.

37:14.743 --> 37:16.292
Sit up straight.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.076
And relax your shoulders...

37:20.741 --> 37:22.475
and relax your neck.

37:24.633 --> 37:27.007
And breathe in through your nose...

37:28.833 --> 37:30.458
and out through your mouth.

37:33.319 --> 37:34.964
Breathe in ...

37:37.121 --> 37:39.414
and out ...

37:42.645 --> 37:48.401
and ...
and out.

38:07.476 --> 38:09.286
How does it feel?

38:11.398 --> 38:12.610
Better ...

38:26.959 --> 38:28.743
My uncle used to say...

38:29.308 --> 38:31.706
don't let fear become your profession.

38:34.542 --> 38:37.429
- It's good advice.
- Keith !

38:38.507 --> 38:40.134
Bonjour...

38:41.497 --> 38:42.831
Good luck.

38:42.979 --> 38:44.574
Thank you.

40:29.713 --> 40:31.413
Thank you very much.

40:45.575 --> 40:47.388
- It was okay.
- Mm hm.

40:47.982 --> 40:50.476
When are you next
playing with the orchestra?

40:51.057 --> 40:52.522
Friday.

40:52.562 --> 40:55.724
- And maybe Saturday, huh?
- On Saturday too?

40:55.725 --> 40:58.186
Can you let me know
if you want a ride down.

40:58.221 --> 40:59.932
We could come and watch you play.

40:59.988 --> 41:01.418
Yeah, well that'll be good.

41:01.419 --> 41:04.200
It would be nice to see
him with everyone else.

41:04.757 --> 41:08.379
It's incredible, I mean
that ... it really is.

41:08.380 --> 41:10.204
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

41:10.432 --> 41:13.674
- What are you playing?
- Which pieces?

41:13.774 --> 41:16.715
We have a number,
Schumann, Bet, Mozart...

41:17.350 --> 41:18.944
Brahms, sounds incredible.

41:19.830 --> 41:21.391
Yeah, I bet.

41:23.262 --> 41:24.499
Great Friday.

41:29.577 --> 41:31.156
How I wish we had a piano.

41:37.138 --> 41:39.471
Are you sure you have?

43:34.423 --> 43:35.264
Hey!

43:37.399 --> 43:40.037
Oh my God !
Wow.

43:40.408 --> 43:43.307
Hi Sheldon, nice to see you.

43:43.599 --> 43:46.046
- I'm glad you came.
- Of course, we wouldn't miss it.

43:46.047 --> 43:47.491
I think we'd genuinely enjoy it tonight.

43:47.492 --> 43:49.067
Yeah, what's going on?

43:49.098 --> 43:52.315
- Thank you.
- Oh yeah... I'm sorry about this.

43:52.316 --> 43:54.091
Oh yes...
I've corrupted him.

43:54.092 --> 43:55.192
Again?

43:55.496 --> 43:57.388
- Wow...
- Hey so Sheldon, this is Sophie.

43:57.389 --> 43:59.363
She's a ... she's one of my student

43:59.398 --> 44:00.225
Nice to meet you.

44:00.227 --> 44:03.843
Exchange student from the UK
and an amazing piano player.

44:04.120 --> 44:06.329
She knocks this
Chopin piece out of a part.

44:06.330 --> 44:07.434
What was it?
It was the ...

44:07.435 --> 44:09.376
It's actually one
of his warm up pieces

44:09.451 --> 44:13.245
but it is so extraordinary that
you can play as a concert piece.

44:13.377 --> 44:16.228
Chopin...
Have you studied a long time?

44:17.745 --> 44:18.889
Many years.

44:18.953 --> 44:20.721
I would think, Chopin, well.

44:21.994 --> 44:23.900
- That's great!  Congratulations.
- Thank you !

44:23.910 --> 44:25.933
You'll have to play for us some night.

44:25.934 --> 44:27.427
- Yeah, I'd love too.
- The front row.

44:27.462 --> 44:28.374
- Yeah, that would be great!

44:28.667 --> 44:30.967
Lauren, you also play too?
Don't you like to ...?

44:31.035 --> 44:32.437
- No...
- I'm sorry.

44:32.472 --> 44:34.528
- Lauren is champion swimmer.
She's incredible.

44:34.529 --> 44:36.341
Swimming, that's right.

44:37.110 --> 44:39.416
- He brags about you all the time.
- Yeah.

44:48.584 --> 44:50.490
Are you sure you don't want to come?

44:51.193 --> 44:54.060
You don't have to be concerned,
I don't feel like going.

44:54.189 --> 44:57.893
- I don't feel left out or whatever.
- I know... I hope, I'm not.

44:57.894 --> 44:59.102
I don't wanna ...

45:00.589 --> 45:04.431
I think it's gonna be
really strange, me and Aaron.

45:04.491 --> 45:06.969
He said that he was going
to be a group of us.

45:07.179 --> 45:11.722
I don't want to be offending
you by going with your person ...

45:11.723 --> 45:15.661
Sophie ! Sophie !
Ok... I really don't care.

45:15.662 --> 45:18.122
I don't know how many
ways to tell you that, you know.

45:18.157 --> 45:20.744
Well... I'm not going to force
you if you don't want to come.

45:21.014 --> 45:23.183
Thank you.

46:14.039 --> 46:14.955
On to your wrist.

46:15.490 --> 46:19.037
- What do you want?
- Let me get a vodka soda, please.

46:19.106 --> 46:21.892
These are from my cousin,
he runs the place.

46:22.091 --> 46:25.511
- That's very kind of you.
- No, it's going to make it a lot of fun.

46:25.546 --> 46:27.882
What time is everyone else staying?

46:29.075 --> 46:31.872
- What?
- What time is everyone else staying here?

46:32.919 --> 46:33.932
Just us.

46:35.412 --> 46:36.327
Just us tonight.

46:36.329 --> 46:38.086
- How much is that?
- Twenty-three.

46:40.012 --> 46:41.226
Thank you.

47:27.490 --> 47:30.213
Thank you... see you on Monday.

47:31.799 --> 47:33.181
Ok...

47:34.465 --> 47:37.737
You looked great all night.
I mean you're so sexy at that club.

47:41.505 --> 47:46.522
- This isn't like a "thing."
- Aren't expecting to be a thing. It's ok.

47:47.857 --> 47:49.743
Ok, I have to focus.

47:54.969 --> 47:58.354
Aaron ! Aaron !
Aaron ! Aaron !

48:01.012 --> 48:02.977
Aaron, Aaron it's okay.

48:12.249 --> 48:13.369
Don't pull my hair.

48:14.292 --> 48:15.434
Close the door, will ya?

48:16.335 --> 48:18.236
Pleae stop it man.

48:19.003 --> 48:20.393
Oh, fuck !

48:20.762 --> 48:21.773
Close the door.

48:22.962 --> 48:25.388
Aaron, fuck off man!

50:36.626 --> 50:38.515
Come on Laurie go, go !

50:50.251 --> 50:51.813
- What happened?
- I don't know...

50:51.814 --> 50:53.697
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

50:55.760 --> 50:56.925
What?

50:56.930 --> 50:58.910
Aaron slept with Sophie.

51:00.549 --> 51:02.525
- When?
- Friday.

51:04.106 --> 51:05.650
What?

51:05.492 --> 51:07.469
- Everyone get to see?
- Yeah.

51:07.796 --> 51:09.380
Aaron slept with Sophie.

51:17.817 --> 51:20.878
Oh no.
Come on, come on.

51:47.092 --> 51:48.770
Sophie, I'll give you a ride!

52:11.790 --> 52:15.229
Oh, my God !
That's insane!

52:15.989 --> 52:17.796
I am trying to change !

52:17.807 --> 52:20.107
- Oh shit! Power's out.
-What?

52:25.132 --> 52:27.299
Don't slip, don't trip.

53:03.236 --> 53:06.146
- Do you want tea?
- I'm gonna have a beer.

53:06.511 --> 53:07.575
Beer?

53:11.477 --> 53:13.257
Can I have a beer?

53:47.271 --> 53:49.065
Do you know what time they'll be back?

53:52.178 --> 53:56.188
It depends... how many girls...

53:56.523 --> 53:59.090
they ask to ferry home, I guess.

54:07.493 --> 54:10.177
Why don't you want to play?
That's what I want to know.

54:10.178 --> 54:12.971
That's the big question, isn't it?

54:14.429 --> 54:17.728
- Why do I want to play?
- Why don't you want to play !

54:20.400 --> 54:25.426
I don't know... I want to choose to play,
I don't wanna do it because I can.

54:26.535 --> 54:29.367
I mean, you're incredible.
How long have you played?

54:29.535 --> 54:33.620
I started training when I was five,
So pretty long time.

54:34.284 --> 54:37.867
John, my uncle got me into the piano,

54:38.035 --> 54:42.268
while he was a teacher
and a pianist and I started.

54:42.425 --> 54:45.545
He would play in the house and
I just kept running up to him.

54:45.987 --> 54:48.954
- Something like, let me play.
- Really?

54:48.989 --> 54:54.207
- Yeah when I was ... that's all.
- Was your dad and your mom musical?

54:55.004 --> 55:00.453
My dad, he used to play guitar and
my mom died when I was really little.

55:00.933 --> 55:03.922
And it was hard for him
to have me on his own, so...

55:05.095 --> 55:07.339
So that's why my aunt
and uncle brought me up.

55:11.479 --> 55:14.557
I was very close to my uncle.

55:14.564 --> 55:17.701
But he passed away recently.
He was very ill.

55:18.321 --> 55:19.830
Sorry.

55:20.521 --> 55:24.500
Yeah, and then I started doing it
professionally when I was nine.

55:25.360 --> 55:29.762
- In bars, weddings?
- Just, you know... karaoke.

55:31.930 --> 55:34.195
I think you should
have been a comedian.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.477
You're definitely
in the wrong job.

55:38.419 --> 55:40.419
Oh, I know that...

55:40.194 --> 55:43.692
I never wanted to teach,
I'm not a teacher.

55:44.060 --> 55:45.642
I have something to tell you.

55:47.275 --> 55:48.261
You're a teacher.

55:49.366 --> 55:54.634
- You are a teacher.
- It says that I am a text form teacher.

55:55.917 --> 55:57.599
So why do you do it, then?

55:58.610 --> 56:00.816
It was a job, you see what I mean.

56:00.891 --> 56:01.890
Secure and...

56:02.864 --> 56:06.608
You know, at least I 'm
teaching the subjects I know

56:06.643 --> 56:09.497
and I'm not teaching
math, or something.

56:10.735 --> 56:12.765
Well, you just have to make
sure that you're choosing.

56:16.647 --> 56:20.395
I just don't want to
be living a life where...

56:21.179 --> 56:23.577
I'm not choosing stuff.

56:25.031 --> 56:27.903
My dad never really got to
do what he wanted to do.

56:28.009 --> 56:30.900
Well he started doing it and
then he kind of fucked himself up.

56:30.913 --> 56:32.660
A lot of people fucked themselves up.

56:35.630 --> 56:37.613
Have you fucked yourself up?

56:42.912 --> 56:45.805
You don't seem as
young as you actually are.

56:47.706 --> 56:49.498
One day you'll be free.

56:58.970 --> 57:01.433
I'd like to play something for you.

59:59.390 --> 01:00:00.546
Keith !

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:04.611
Lauren is with you?  Wipers
didn't work. The car is a hazard.

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.879
- Yeah.. I'm here.
- You took the Jeep.

01:00:09.914 --> 01:00:10.789
i'm sorry.

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:12.938
- Why did you take the Jeep?
- I was trying to get your attention !

01:00:12.939 --> 01:00:14.803
- get my attention?
- I don't have the keys.

01:00:14.804 --> 01:00:17.005
I was just trying to
get the swim team home.

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.120
What happened?

01:00:18.122 --> 01:00:19.565
- This just broke.
- How did this break?

01:00:20.596 --> 01:00:21.940
Why are the lights out?

01:00:23.488 --> 01:00:25.951
Sorry, I couldn't see.
I knocked it off. I'm sorry.

01:00:25.952 --> 01:00:27.786
How could you knock this off?
This is the safest place.

01:00:27.787 --> 01:00:28.938
The lights are out.
I couldn't see.

01:00:28.939 --> 01:00:31.451
- Is Sophie home?
- Yes, I drove her home.

01:00:35.939 --> 01:00:37.103
You're having a beer?

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:54.057
It is a weight on my shoulders trying to
get you show some interest and passion

01:00:54.058 --> 01:00:56.172
and for 17 years I have tried to ...

01:00:56.173 --> 01:00:58.417
I did what I was doing 17 years ago

01:00:58.418 --> 01:01:01.993
I love teaching kids... in a
school ....

01:01:05.658 --> 01:01:07.128
You said you enjoyed teaching

01:01:08.777 --> 01:01:10.575
Well, you said you enjoyed driving.

01:01:12.757 --> 01:01:15.100
You 're an jerk.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.368
- Slut.
- I know.

01:02:28.553 --> 01:02:32.090
That's way too fast, I wouldn't
even attempt something like that.

01:02:32.481 --> 01:02:33.672
That's you crazy?

01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:35.233
I'm trying to know you all are.

01:02:48.082 --> 01:02:51.027
Chloe, will you hand these out.
I'll be back.

01:02:51.162 --> 01:02:52.101
I'll be back.

01:02:57.835 --> 01:02:58.722
Hey...

01:03:02.496 --> 01:03:05.533
- Can you talk?
- Of course, what's wrong?

01:03:13.088 --> 01:03:16.187
I just feel like I 'm causing
so many problems here.

01:03:17.487 --> 01:03:19.034
No, you're not.

01:03:20.248 --> 01:03:22.317
- I just needed...
- You're not.

01:03:53.759 --> 01:03:54.843
Look...

01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:59.308
I have period after lunch, and
I can get someone to substitute.

01:03:59.344 --> 01:04:02.724
Just wanna go somewhere?

01:04:05.082 --> 01:04:07.016
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:11.004
Ok.

01:04:16.171 --> 01:04:18.694
I'll come find you.

01:04:18.944 --> 01:04:20.824
Thank you.

01:05:09.131 --> 01:05:12.100
It's funny that it took you to bring
me here. I've lived here for 20 years.

01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:14.877
You have nver been here.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:17.864
I didn't pass it, but I've
never actually come down here.

01:05:18.465 --> 01:05:19.365
Why?

01:05:20.766 --> 01:05:23.334
Cause I have never a reason to.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.602
It would be nice not to
go back at all, wouldn't it?

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:37.586
It's so hard to actually
do what you want to do.

01:05:38.953 --> 01:05:45.034
What's this gonna say, it's funny that
we you feel so contrained by what

01:05:45.303 --> 01:05:49.246
you think our options are.
But what about my options?

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.698
I think that's hard to know.

01:05:54.103 --> 01:05:56.931
How to be... like truly free.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:03.588
And whether that's
even a good thing.

01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:11.742
Maybe boundaries are there for a good reason.

01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:15.356
- Structure.
- Something I could teach.

01:06:37.921 --> 01:06:40.156
What makes you happy?

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.255
At the moment there is only really
one thing that makes me happy.

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:48.612
Really?

01:06:50.037 --> 01:06:51.926
It's true.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.476
What do you thinki?

01:07:18.193 --> 01:07:20.375
I'll miss you if you ran away.

01:07:21.841 --> 01:07:23.626
I am not running away.

01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:32.828
My ... a lot of thing.

01:07:36.098 --> 01:07:39.380
I want you to steal me away,
that's what I want you to do.

01:07:40.415 --> 01:07:42.040
In your life.

01:07:47.739 --> 01:07:52.727
Get in the car...
and start driving.

01:08:17.685 --> 01:08:19.608
Do not ....

01:08:57.729 --> 01:09:00.669
- So how was Sophie?
- Well, pretty good.

01:09:05.288 --> 01:09:07.562
Wait... what... !

01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:10.988
You serious, Lauren?

01:09:11.089 --> 01:09:14.335
- Just get into the car.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:07.816 --> 01:11:11.120
- Where is Lauren?
- She's at Angela's.

01:11:12.088 --> 01:11:13.615
Excuse me.

01:11:32.446 --> 01:11:35.053
Great, bye.

01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:44.138
- She spending the night?
- That was Bruce.

01:11:45.954 --> 01:11:47.663
I got the chair.

01:12:00.111 --> 01:12:04.658
Guess I'm, not a teacher any more.

01:12:05.809 --> 01:12:07.516
We have to celebrate.

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:11.131
- I'm getting ice cream.
- Well, I haven't finished.

01:12:11.343 --> 01:12:13.682
Well, Sophie and I will have
some joint chocolate, strawberry?

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:15.209
Alright I 'm okay, thanks.

01:12:15.249 --> 01:12:17.720
Alright, well then,
I'm going to celebrate.

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:06.649
Are you okay?

01:13:07.013 --> 01:13:08.888
Lauren...you so fucking small.

01:13:10.501 --> 01:13:11.730
Stop it.

01:13:14.112 --> 01:13:15.607
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop it.

01:13:16.002 --> 01:13:19.299
Lauren, I didn't sleep with Aaron.

01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:23.640
Sit up.

01:13:28.824 --> 01:13:30.017
This is my house.

01:13:33.249 --> 01:13:34.379
I'm sorry.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.775
I saw you at the reservoir today.

01:13:42.622 --> 01:13:44.363
Stop breathing like that.

01:13:46.147 --> 01:13:47.294
You have to get out.

01:13:47.395 --> 01:13:51.046
I don't have to get out !
I don't need to get out of your bed.

01:13:51.415 --> 01:13:53.849
Lauren!
Lauren!

01:13:56.516 --> 01:13:57.411
Don't!

01:13:58.656 --> 01:14:00.048
Please.

01:14:03.257 --> 01:14:04.602
I'm sorry!

01:14:30.829 --> 01:14:31.890
What's wrong?

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:36.018
Are you okay?

01:14:41.688 --> 01:14:45.922
I... I can't stay here anymore.

01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:52.273
- I have to leave.
- I don't want you to leave.

01:14:52.274 --> 01:14:53.534
I know...

01:14:58.185 --> 01:14:59.310
What happened?

01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:07.751
- I have to go.
- I don't want you to go.

01:15:16.089 --> 01:15:20.701
Listen...
I'm playing tomorrow night.

01:15:23.028 --> 01:15:24.401
You meet me later.

01:15:26.113 --> 01:15:30.215
We just get in the
car and start driving.

01:15:38.305 --> 01:15:39.889
Ok.

01:16:08.487 --> 01:16:09.743
What are you doing?

01:16:14.516 --> 01:16:19.800
I 'm gonna to stay
with my friend, Jessica,

01:16:19.805 --> 01:16:21.174
for the evening.

01:16:22.099 --> 01:16:25.954
- Where?
- Her family has got a beach house.

01:16:25.973 --> 01:16:29.345
And she said we
could camp on the beach.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:31.787
- Camping on the beach?
- Yeah.

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:38.017
Listen. That sounds really nice but
you have to ask my permission.

01:16:38.018 --> 01:16:40.900
I can't let you just take off like that.
You are my responsibility.

01:16:40.901 --> 01:16:42.321
Yeah, it's all being quite last minute,

01:16:42.322 --> 01:16:46.199
so I don't have a
chance to tell you last night.

01:16:49.588 --> 01:16:51.667
But I can call you when I get there.

01:16:52.368 --> 01:16:56.210
Did you see Lauren this morning,
by any chance, before she left?

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:58.700
No... I got up later than her.

01:17:00.078 --> 01:17:02.301
- Do you want a ride?
- I'll be fine.

01:17:02.302 --> 01:17:05.348
- Ok, please be careful on the road.
- Ok.

01:17:51.845 --> 01:17:53.447
Lauren 's not picking up her phone.

01:17:54.865 --> 01:17:58.035
Did she say anything to you this
morning where she was going so early?

01:17:58.579 --> 01:18:00.377
She said she's fine.

01:18:01.866 --> 01:18:04.202
Sophie told me she's camping.

01:18:09.778 --> 01:18:10.735
I don't know...

01:18:13.771 --> 01:18:17.430
Wish someone would keep me in
the loop about what 's going on here.

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:18.546
You gotta talk to these girls.

01:18:18.885 --> 01:18:22.067
- I'm playing tonight.
- Well, I'll talk to you after.

01:18:22.148 --> 01:18:24.575
Yeah.. I'm gonna take the Jeep.

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.191
- No.. I'll drive you.
- It's okay.

01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:30.303
- Really, I ...
- I don't need to take me, that's ok.

01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:51.031
You had us worried.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:56.226
Did you call your mom?

01:19:05.965 --> 01:19:07.927
Are you okay?

01:20:48.011 --> 01:20:50.808
Hello, is this Jessica's mom?

01:20:51.977 --> 01:20:55.468
Oh hi, it's Megan Reynolds...
I am Sophie Williams...

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:57.660
The English girl staying with us.

01:20:58.758 --> 01:21:00.036
Hi, is she there?

01:21:04.769 --> 01:21:09.632
She said she was going to the
beach with Jessica and your family.

01:21:17.858 --> 01:21:21.222
You know what?
She just walked in.

01:21:23.074 --> 01:21:24.747
Yeah..

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.643
Well, I hope it wasn't any bother.

01:21:27.707 --> 01:21:29.313
Ok...

01:21:29.747 --> 01:21:31.298
Thank you.

01:22:01.962 --> 01:22:06.176
Hey, may I talk to
you for a second?

01:22:07.078 --> 01:22:10.742
Um, I'm in the
middle of a conversation.

01:22:10.885 --> 01:22:12.892
- I know, but they don't just feel like.
- No.

01:22:13.953 --> 01:22:15.304
Not right now.

01:22:16.384 --> 01:22:18.417
So you see.

01:22:21.482 --> 01:22:23.401
I'll be right back, alright.

01:22:30.935 --> 01:22:33.099
Let me make you redeem for your car.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.963
Stop it. Stop it.

01:22:37.464 --> 01:22:39.079
Enough.

01:22:39.647 --> 01:22:41.039
I'm sorry.

01:22:41.212 --> 01:22:43.758
I don't care.

01:22:44.757 --> 01:22:47.483
Stop it! Stop it!
Come on.

01:22:52.379 --> 01:22:54.043
You are pathetic.

01:26:02.535 --> 01:26:05.119
I don't think I made a mistake.

01:27:36.208 --> 01:27:37.117
What are they saying?

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.713
They haven't said anything yet.

01:28:26.693 --> 01:28:29.753
Hi. You can come with me.

01:31:08.448 --> 01:31:11.082
You have any ideas ....?

01:31:14.501 --> 01:31:18.217
- Smile.
- One more smile.

01:31:30.037 --> 01:31:33.493
One, two, three.
Look here, smile.
