WEBVTT

00:05.657 --> 00:08.095
Previously onDynasty...That private airline?

00:08.138 --> 00:10.314
I bought it, and I'm
giving it to you.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.924
JEFF:
Nolan Jamison.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.665
You're working on something big
in the area

00:13.709 --> 00:15.276
of fuel-efficient
energy sources.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.278
Next time you want to hire
an organized crime boss,

00:17.321 --> 00:18.975
a little heads-up
would be nice.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.107
Whenever I've needed you,
you've been there.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.499
You're like a daughter to me.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.762
Maybe it's time Colby Co.
gets in the fashion game.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.026
We don't have days to get this
tumor out, we have hours.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.855
[horn blaring]

00:29.899 --> 00:31.727
She's barely got a pulse.
Call 911. Kirby!

00:37.733 --> 00:39.735
Which do you want first,
the good news or the bad news?

00:39.778 --> 00:41.911
Good news. That way,
when you tell me the bad news,

00:41.954 --> 00:43.869
I can remember when I was happy
because of the good news.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.262
Okay, the good news is...No, wait.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.959
Maybe I should hear
the bad news first

00:47.003 --> 00:48.918
so that I can have something
to look forward to.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.094
Can I change my answer?No. This isn't at game show.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.792
The good news is, after
two weeks in the hospital,

00:53.836 --> 00:56.143
the doctors have decided
that Kirby is strong enough

00:56.186 --> 00:57.274
to go home later today.

00:57.318 --> 01:00.016
That's great.
What's the bad news?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.409
We have to tell her
about Anders.

01:01.452 --> 01:04.716
[sighs] Right.
That's definitely bad.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.109
And we have to
do that today?

01:06.153 --> 01:07.806
Well, first we said
we'd tell her he died

01:07.850 --> 01:09.069
after she woke up
from the coma.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.809
Then we said that,
you know, we'd wait

01:10.853 --> 01:13.116
until she was more alert
so she'd understand.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.466
And then we said we'd wait
till she was off meds,

01:15.510 --> 01:17.077
so it didn't seem
like a dream.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.470
And then we said we'd tell her
the day she was discharged.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.081
Which is today.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.995
Yeah.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.868
[woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.]

01:25.911 --> 01:26.869
Morning.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.480
I feel refreshed
and ready to go.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.482
Turns out
a medically induced coma

01:31.526 --> 01:33.136
is the best sleep
a gal can get.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.007
[chuckles]

01:35.051 --> 01:37.880
You don't need to look
so worried.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.012
We don't?

01:40.056 --> 01:42.798
I feel good. This has been
a huge wake-up call.

01:42.841 --> 01:44.365
And hospitals suck;

01:44.408 --> 01:45.844
I really don't want
to come back here.FALLON: Yeah.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.281
Twice in one year.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.891
I don't want to have
to visit you here again, either.

01:48.934 --> 01:52.199
You won't. Oliver,
the drugs, partying,

01:52.242 --> 01:53.243
it's all in the past.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.940
We're just happy
you're okay.

01:54.984 --> 01:58.205
Yeah, we are.

01:58.248 --> 02:01.033
Um... you know,

02:01.077 --> 02:03.949
the past few weeks
have been...

02:03.993 --> 02:05.864
they've been tough.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.563
And, uh, we--

02:15.570 --> 02:17.006
We have to tell
you something.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.051
â™ª

02:22.620 --> 02:24.883
ADAM: Your brain
is grossly normal.

02:24.927 --> 02:27.582
Is that good news?It's excellent news.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.019
Dr. Scott removed the tumor
from the brain stem.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.673
There-There's still
some swelling,

02:31.716 --> 02:33.762
but I have no reason
to believe

02:33.805 --> 02:34.850
that you won't make
a full recovery.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.199
Oh, thank God.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.027
Of course, you'll need
periodic scans,

02:38.070 --> 02:40.595
but as of right now,
I'm happy to say

02:40.638 --> 02:42.031
you're cancer-free.

02:42.074 --> 02:44.990
Thank you, son.
This is the news that I, um...

02:45.034 --> 02:47.732
that we needed to hear.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.908
It's been a tough
couple of weeks

02:49.952 --> 02:51.649
between losing Anders and...

02:53.085 --> 02:55.827
Don't you ever scare me
like that again.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.829
It wasn't exactly fun
for me, either.

02:57.873 --> 03:00.267
Which is why this calls
for something special.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.617
I say we start with
a celebratory meal.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.227
Anywhere you want.
The world's your oyster.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.230
Ooh, seafood does sound good.Done.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.840
Okay, I have to go.
Board meeting.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.233
I'm impressed...

03:10.277 --> 03:12.757
with how you're handling
the chief of staff job.

03:12.801 --> 03:15.238
Now I know what it feels like
to be a Jewish mother.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.675
This place is gonna be
world-class under me.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.677
Lofty goals.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.592
But I would expect nothing less

03:21.636 --> 03:23.986
from the man who performed
my wife's brain surgery.

03:24.029 --> 03:26.249
I only assisted Dr. Scott.

03:26.293 --> 03:28.338
You were the one who insisted
on not waiting

03:28.382 --> 03:30.253
for Dr. Scott to get here.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.907
You saved my life.

03:34.649 --> 03:38.653
According to this report,
online sales for Dom-Mystique

03:38.696 --> 03:40.307
are sluggish at best.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.265
Everyone wants to be
an overnight success,

03:42.309 --> 03:45.616
but it takes time to build
a solid company-- be patient.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.139
Don't talk to me about patience.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.272
I've waited to feel this
passionately about something

03:49.316 --> 03:50.273
my entire life.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.797
Fine.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.146
So what do you think
the problem is?

03:54.190 --> 03:56.279
Our marketing strategy.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.976
We need a new plan.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.022
Maybe billboards.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.153
No, we're not doing billboards.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.372
All right, people blow past
those things

04:02.416 --> 04:03.634
at 80 miles an hour.

04:03.678 --> 04:04.809
And you need more than
four seconds

04:04.853 --> 04:06.158
to connect with your customer.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.638
But right now,

04:07.682 --> 04:09.988
I need to set a meeting
with Korosh Patel.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.208
Does he know anything
about selling clothes

04:12.252 --> 04:13.340
at affordable prices?

04:13.383 --> 04:14.732
If not, why are we
talking about him?

04:14.776 --> 04:16.995
He's the leading mind
in renewable energy.

04:17.039 --> 04:19.302
Which is why I need
to convince him to work for me

04:19.346 --> 04:21.173
And since when is Colby Co.
into renewable energy?

04:21.217 --> 04:24.742
Since I'm trying to make it
a more eco-conscious business.

04:24.786 --> 04:26.309
Any more questions,
or can I go?

04:26.353 --> 04:28.833
You can go.
But I don't like that tone.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.314
Or these numbers.

04:31.358 --> 04:34.665
Don't forget the billboards.No billboards!

04:34.709 --> 04:36.406
Please have a seat,
Dr. Carrington.

04:36.450 --> 04:40.062
Yes. While I have the chairman
of the board to myself,

04:40.105 --> 04:43.674
I would like to run
a few ideas by you

04:43.718 --> 04:45.154
before the others arrive.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.722
No one else is coming.Oh, perfect.

04:47.765 --> 04:50.855
Not really, because
we have a problem.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.030
There are rumors
that you threatened

04:52.074 --> 04:53.510
the hospital's head of finance

04:53.554 --> 04:56.078
in order to obtain funding
for one of your projects.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.210
Rumors? Come on. If--

04:58.254 --> 05:01.126
If somebody said
that I threatened Karen,

05:01.170 --> 05:02.867
it's obviously
a misunderstanding.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.260
I'll-I'll talk to her.Well, she quit,

05:04.304 --> 05:06.088
and moved her ailing sister
to another hospital.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.177
She claims it was
for better care,

05:08.220 --> 05:10.005
but I'm skeptical.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.355
I'm sure this is just
a typical Karen overreaction.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.052
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.054
You're barely holding onto
the chief of staff position,

05:16.098 --> 05:17.229
Dr. Carrington.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.144
And if it weren't for
your last name,

05:19.188 --> 05:21.277
you wouldn't be holding on
to anything at all.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.715
Excuse me, I just performed
a cutting-edge brain surgery.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.369
Which was against
hospital policy

05:26.413 --> 05:28.980
as the patient is
a relative of yours.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.374
Plus, you're not
a neurosurgeon.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.985
And if Dr. Scott hadn't
arrived when she did,

05:34.029 --> 05:36.292
who knows what
would have happened?

05:36.336 --> 05:39.948
Now, this'll be your first
and your last warning.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.167
You have any questions,
Dr. Carrington?

05:47.259 --> 05:49.131
Did we really need this big
a refresh in here?

05:49.174 --> 05:51.133
I mean, are you bored
because Liam is off

05:51.176 --> 05:52.264
in some cabin writing?

05:52.308 --> 05:55.267
'Cause it's feeling
a little O-T-T.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.747
You think this is
over-the-top?

05:56.791 --> 05:58.227
I wanted to bring in
a four-poster bed

05:58.270 --> 05:59.271
with lace curtains.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.404
Poor Kirby.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.014
I hope she's not
too depressed.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.930
Telling her about Anders
was rough.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.410
Telling her about
Anders was rough?

06:07.454 --> 06:10.108
You mean when I told her
and you sat there and watched?

06:10.152 --> 06:11.806
Of course she's
gonna be depressed.

06:11.849 --> 06:14.243
I mean, she missed
her father's funeral.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.941
Wait, I hear them.
I hear them. Come here.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.857
Hi, guys. Wow.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.773
It looks great in here.
I love the new blanket!

06:22.817 --> 06:24.775
One of Oprah's
favorite things.

06:24.819 --> 06:27.778
Well, it's all so...
soothing.

06:27.822 --> 06:31.129
Yeah, well, you know, it's
the least I could do after, um,

06:31.173 --> 06:34.350
after, uh, you know, the...

06:34.394 --> 06:36.526
After everything that happened.[Kirby chuckles]

06:36.570 --> 06:38.136
You need anything else
before I go?

06:38.180 --> 06:40.182
And remember what I said,
take it easy

06:40.225 --> 06:43.490
and let people help you.I'm good.
I have everything I need.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.801
There is something I need.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.063
That was quick.Oh.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.282
Well, I can't sit around
and mope

06:53.325 --> 06:54.457
about my dad all day.

06:54.501 --> 06:57.025
He would have hated that.
And I'll go crazy.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.549
So I need a job.
A modeling job, to be specific.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.116
Do you think
that's a good idea?

07:01.159 --> 07:03.161
Work will help me deal
with the stress,

07:03.205 --> 07:05.555
and I don't want to lose
the momentum I had.FALLON: Right.

07:05.599 --> 07:08.253
Um, okay.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.342
Uh, well, I'll make some calls.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.301
I'll talk to some
editors, but first,

07:12.344 --> 07:14.129
I want to give you a few weeks
to reacclimate, you know,

07:14.172 --> 07:15.304
and then we'll get you
back out there.

07:15.347 --> 07:18.089
No, I already know
which job I want.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.961
I want to be one of
the ten models on the catwalk

07:20.004 --> 07:21.615
at the upcoming
Designer Institute Ball.

07:21.658 --> 07:25.053
The theme is celestial bodies,
and, well, I think I have one.

07:25.096 --> 07:29.492
You do, but what kind
of ball is this?

07:29.536 --> 07:30.928
Some sort of
Cinderella fantasy?

07:30.972 --> 07:33.191
It's the most high-profile
fashion event in Atlanta.

07:33.235 --> 07:36.238
Yes, yes, I know it well.
I go every year.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.544
Well, great. So you call
the head of the institute.

07:37.587 --> 07:38.893
Paloma something?

07:38.936 --> 07:42.374
Paloma Benioff and I
actually co-chaired

07:42.418 --> 07:44.376
the Atlanta Art Walk
together one year.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.467
Yeah. She puts ice
in her rosÃ©.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.381
Anyway, that night's
a crazy circus

07:49.425 --> 07:52.341
of, you know, paparazzi,
posers and partying.

07:52.384 --> 07:55.213
So it's really not the right
thing for you right now.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.260
Well, would you rather
I stay in bed all day

07:58.303 --> 07:59.566
feeling sorry
for myself?

08:01.132 --> 08:04.527
Uh, okay,
I will give Paloma a call,

08:04.571 --> 08:06.050
but I really can't make
any promises.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.965
Thanks. This is exactly
what I need.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.315
This and a sandwich.
And some ice cream.

08:10.359 --> 08:12.013
Hospital food's
really terrible.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.971
[chuckles]

08:16.104 --> 08:17.888
Well, she's definitely
not depressed,

08:17.932 --> 08:19.237
but she's in serious denial.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.544
I mean, she clearly doesn't want
to face reality.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.112
But if we push her
to face reality,

08:24.155 --> 08:26.070
it could shatter her
if she's not ready.

08:26.114 --> 08:29.247
I have done some research
on this, and smothering

08:29.291 --> 08:32.250
actually doesn't help much
either, so it's tricky.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.687
We need to call a therapist.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.993
Did you not just hear
what I said about research?

08:36.037 --> 08:37.255
We don't need a therapist, okay?

08:37.299 --> 08:38.605
I got this.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.260
Somehow that doesn't make me
feel any better.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.261
FALLON:
I heard that.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.525
â™ª

09:06.589 --> 09:09.549
FALLON:
Paloma, you're looking well.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.680
Do people ever call you "Plum"?

09:10.724 --> 09:14.118
No. We're both very busy women.

09:14.162 --> 09:16.294
Why don't we skip
the small talk, Fallon?

09:16.338 --> 09:18.993
Great. Because I was out
of material anyway.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.995
A friend of mine,
who just happens to be

09:21.038 --> 09:23.998
a fantastic model,
would make a great addition

09:24.041 --> 09:26.043
to the group for the ball.
Her name is Kirby Anders.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.349
Never heard of her.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.481
She's an up and comer.
She's beautiful.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.614
And I know that you are
the person to see

09:31.658 --> 09:33.137
if strings need to be pulled.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.662
We book these models
a year in advance

09:35.705 --> 09:37.751
because of
their busy schedules.

09:37.794 --> 09:41.145
Because they're supermodels,
not super-new models.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.712
Right. No, I got that.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.540
But I appreciate
your casual bluntness.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.022
How about this? What if
you put her last in the lineup?

09:48.065 --> 09:51.199
You know, everybody will be
seven chardonnays deep

09:51.242 --> 09:52.766
at that point, and they won't
even notice when she comes out

09:52.809 --> 09:54.202
that she's not Bella Hadid.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.725
Well, I could consider that

09:55.769 --> 09:58.728
if you'd consider giving up
your regular dinner table

09:58.772 --> 10:00.600
at the Four Seasons
every Saturday.

10:00.643 --> 10:04.038
But it's the best table
in the restaurant.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.430
Which is why I'm asking.

10:05.474 --> 10:08.346
Hmm. Sure.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.739
Yeah, it's yours.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.785
Kirby will be thrilled,
and, technically,

10:11.828 --> 10:13.700
wherever I sit is
the best table.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.484
Oh, I need you to hire
a new assistant editor

10:15.527 --> 10:16.659
at your magazine.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.487
Oh. Well, I'm very happy
with my team,

10:18.530 --> 10:19.793
unless you know somebody great.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.316
Janie Benioff.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.405
Hmm. Never heard of her.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.798
Well, she's my daughter.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.321
Oh.

10:26.364 --> 10:27.539
She's not an editor,
but she's written

10:27.583 --> 10:29.629
several online
articles.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.718
I think this would be
a great bump-up for her.

10:31.761 --> 10:36.548
I can't risk sacrificing
the quality of my magazine.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.116
It would be an insult
to everyone who works there.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.814
Assistant editor
or no deal.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.250
[chuckles]

10:42.293 --> 10:46.254
I am not interested
in horse trading.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.604
You can enjoy your
watered-down rosÃ©.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.650
I will find something else
for Kirby.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.350
Do you think we're the first
construction project in history

10:55.393 --> 10:56.656
to ever be under budget?

10:56.699 --> 10:59.093
That's one bright spot of having
Leo at the helm.

10:59.136 --> 11:02.792
Yeah, the, uh, organized crime
glass is totally half full.

11:02.836 --> 11:05.577
Well, what I learned
from my Ada Stone experience

11:05.621 --> 11:07.710
is that there's always
a way out.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.451
Although I almost got killed
trying it.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.844
With Ada, ignorance
was bliss.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.498
So we turn a blind eye
until construction is over

11:13.542 --> 11:14.674
and pray we never see Leo again.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.110
You think he'll disappear?Ada did.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.199
And as long as we don't know
what Leo's up to,

11:18.242 --> 11:20.201
we have plausible deniability
when he gets caught

11:20.244 --> 11:22.464
doing whatever illegal
thing he's doing.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.031
Okay. I can be ignorant.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.815
[clicks tongue]Let's grab lunch.

11:28.426 --> 11:31.212
Is this for me?

11:31.255 --> 11:32.735
I mean, I am the boss.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.085
One and only.

11:39.481 --> 11:42.136
Is that...
Tons of drugs?

11:42.179 --> 11:43.746
Yes.We'll deal with it
later tonight,

11:43.790 --> 11:45.095
once the construction crew
is gone.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.314
But for now,
get that out of sight

11:46.357 --> 11:48.098
before someone
walks in here.

11:53.408 --> 11:56.628
You know I'd be happy to eat
at any seafood place in Atlanta.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.674
BLAKE:Hey, you want crab?
We get the best.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.285
If that means Joe's in Miami,
then that's where we go.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.766
You only live once.Mm.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.421
You see that land down there?

12:06.464 --> 12:09.598
I'm trying to acquire it for
my new aviation business.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.732
Which part?All of it.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.517
Just have to figure out how.
It's not for sale.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.737
The guy who owns it
is some big wheat farmer

12:17.780 --> 12:19.129
who turns down every offer.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.609
Maybe he doesn't need the money.

12:20.652 --> 12:23.090
Who doesn't want money?
That land's worth a fortune.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.787
And what are you gonna
do with it?

12:24.831 --> 12:28.443
Build a private airport
close to Metro Atlanta.

12:28.486 --> 12:29.836
CEOs don't want to waste time
getting in and out

12:29.879 --> 12:31.663
of the heart of major cities.
If I can do that,

12:31.707 --> 12:34.579
I will take this corporate jet
business to the next level.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.451
But you said it's not for sale.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.800
I'll find a way.

12:39.149 --> 12:42.457
And I promise you
it will be on the up-and-up.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.893
Somehow.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.505
This is what Anders
was so good at.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.725
If he was here, he would
have found this guy's

12:49.769 --> 12:51.248
third grade girlfriend
and already got

12:51.292 --> 12:52.293
the inside information.

12:52.336 --> 12:55.426
He's still with you.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.732
And you'll get that land.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.867
I just figured
if I wanted to get into

13:00.910 --> 13:03.565
energy-efficient
frozen fuel,

13:03.608 --> 13:04.696
there was only one person
to see.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.829
Well, I appreciate that--

13:06.873 --> 13:09.353
assuming you mean me, of course.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.790
Of course.[both laugh]

13:10.833 --> 13:12.487
And now is the time
to do it.

13:12.530 --> 13:16.230
Earth's resources are dwindling.
Energy costs are rising.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.275
I could not agree more.

13:18.319 --> 13:21.539
I didn't think Colby Co.
was chopping down rain forests.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.237
We're not.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.326
But as a citizen of the world,

13:25.369 --> 13:26.675
I figure why not use

13:26.718 --> 13:29.156
my plentiful resources
to help others?

13:29.199 --> 13:31.158
Yeah. How commendable.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.508
Well, I do believe
there's a profit to be made.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.597
It's not totally selfless.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.468
So, are you interested?

13:37.512 --> 13:40.515
Because when it comes
to this stuff, there's you...

13:40.558 --> 13:41.516
and then there's everyone else.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.474
[both laugh]

13:43.518 --> 13:45.346
Well, flattery will
get you everywhere.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.914
But why should I partner
with you?

13:47.957 --> 13:52.527
Because my company is
a leader in its field.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.703
And cutting-edge tech
belongs with

13:54.746 --> 13:56.270
cutting-edge
environmental science.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.884
It's a serious offer.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.191
And you can use my
vacation house in the Bahamas

14:04.234 --> 14:06.671
anytime you want
except Labor Day.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.717
I kind of like to blow
it out that weekend.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.719
[both laugh]

14:12.939 --> 14:15.898
Uh, why is Nolan Jamison here?

14:15.942 --> 14:17.552
Please tell me
that's a coincidence.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.380
Well, I could tell you that.

14:19.423 --> 14:20.468
My apologies, Korosh.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.817
I'm five minutes early.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.558
I'll go grab a coffee
and let you two wrap up.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.820
Mm.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.909
Don't believe
a word he says.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.564
[laughter]

14:31.000 --> 14:33.829
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

14:33.873 --> 14:35.831
Uh...
Dr. Larson,

14:35.875 --> 14:39.400
why is your Alzheimer's drug
still in clinical trials?

14:39.443 --> 14:41.402
I was hoping to make an
announcement about its efficacy

14:41.445 --> 14:42.620
in the next few days.

14:42.664 --> 14:43.752
I'm sorry.

14:43.795 --> 14:44.971
There was a setback
in phase two.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.668
Myriad side effects need
to be addressed

14:46.711 --> 14:48.061
before we can move on.

14:48.104 --> 14:51.281
All drugs have side effects.But these are extreme.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.762
Plus, it's still not doing
what it's supposed to do.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.417
So we're not moving on
to phase three at the moment.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.810
I know research isn't
your field, Dr. Carrington,

14:58.854 --> 15:01.509
but getting a drug
approved takes time.

15:03.250 --> 15:07.558
Well, my field is
this entire institution,

15:07.602 --> 15:10.561
which I'm gonna turn into
a world-class health center.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.434
Now, you can either
figure this out

15:13.477 --> 15:15.436
and join us in what we're doing,

15:15.479 --> 15:17.960
or you can read about it
at some underfunded

15:18.004 --> 15:20.397
community hospital.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.403
Dr. Bridges.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.493
Um, Michael Harrison.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.366
Yeah, yes, yes, it has been
a while, hasn't it?

15:32.409 --> 15:33.758
Um, what was it?

15:33.802 --> 15:37.458
Intro to Clinical Medicine,
I think.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.460
Right, so, um, I'm working

15:39.503 --> 15:42.898
on a new Alzheimer's drug,

15:42.942 --> 15:46.815
and there are some possible
anti-aging side effects.

15:46.858 --> 15:50.297
I know this is
your area of expertise,

15:50.340 --> 15:53.822
so I was wondering
if I sent you the data...

15:53.865 --> 15:56.346
would you let me know
what you think?

15:58.087 --> 16:00.002
Great.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.570
And if we could keep this
between us for now,

16:02.613 --> 16:05.660
that would be wonderful.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.401
Okay, thanks.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.318
How'd it go with Paloma?

16:11.361 --> 16:14.495
Oh, well, apparently

16:14.538 --> 16:16.758
the modeling slots have
been filled for a year.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.978
Well, maybe you can
convince her to add a slot,

16:19.021 --> 16:21.023
because what's better
than ten models? 11.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.634
Mm-hmm.
She seemed pretty set.

16:23.678 --> 16:26.202
But I have calls out
to several other people,

16:26.246 --> 16:28.291
and there is a job
with your name on it.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.206
[disappointed chuckle]

16:30.250 --> 16:32.904
I can get a job, Fallon.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.602
But I really wanted this job.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.386
Everyone at that gala
is someone who can

16:36.430 --> 16:37.431
help me with my career.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.606
And aren't you always
talking about

16:38.649 --> 16:39.911
surrounding yourself
with the right people?

16:39.955 --> 16:42.436
That doesn't really
sound like me.

16:42.479 --> 16:45.569
Look, Kirby,

16:45.613 --> 16:47.397
maybe you should
take some time

16:47.441 --> 16:48.964
to process your loss.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.226
Everyone else has
had a chance

16:50.270 --> 16:52.315
to come to terms
with Anders' death.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.143
Give yourself some
space to mourn.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.146
Thanks for your concern,
but I've dealt with my feelings,

16:57.190 --> 16:59.975
and it started more than
two weeks ago.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.457
When my dad had that
heart attack a few years ago,

17:03.500 --> 17:06.982
I thought about what it
might be like losing him,

17:07.026 --> 17:08.288
because I thought
I was going to.

17:08.331 --> 17:12.248
Okay, but that was
a little different.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.597
He didn't die.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.992
You know what?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.950
It's fine.
Oliver's crew is still working.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.430
I'm sure they have
something available.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.302
No, no, no, no, no. Please.
That is the opposite of

17:22.345 --> 17:23.955
surrounding yourself
with the right people.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.087
I'll be fine.But...

17:25.131 --> 17:26.132
I can take care of myself.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.184
[exhales]

17:35.228 --> 17:39.275
Hi. Fallon Carrington
for Paloma Benioff.

17:39.319 --> 17:42.104
Okay, just tell her
to have her daughter

17:42.148 --> 17:43.975
come by my office next week.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.325
She'll know what it's about.

17:51.505 --> 17:52.984
[toilet flushes]SAM: Damn it!

17:53.028 --> 17:55.987
What?
It won't flush.
It's just floating.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.250
What do you mean, "floating"?

17:57.293 --> 18:00.601
Like a rubber ducky,
but cocaine.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.559
And if I force it
and the pipes clog,

18:02.603 --> 18:04.474
Leo's crew will be
in charge of fixing them.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.128
Okay, new plan.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.565
We throw it in a dumpster.
But not ours.

18:08.609 --> 18:11.133
We don't need drugs connected
to La Mirage.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.656
However, if drugs were
connected to a dumpster

18:12.700 --> 18:14.136
at the hotel down the street,

18:14.180 --> 18:16.486
that is not our problem.I like your thinking.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.619
Let's go.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.011
Enjoy.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.318
I'm only here
as a courtesy.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.451
Oh, and because
I love the rib-eye.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.148
I'm more of a porterhouse man
myself.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.671
I also hear you're
a bit of a jerk.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.674
Or as my mother used
to say to my sister,

18:30.718 --> 18:32.763
"You have a...
a bad reputation."

18:32.807 --> 18:35.244
Well, I'm sorry
I didn't know your sister.

18:36.637 --> 18:40.119
Anyway, listen, I'm-I'm sure
that some of the things

18:40.162 --> 18:43.165
you heard about me are true.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.427
But I'm a changed man.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.342
Yeah, well, my mother
also used to say

18:46.386 --> 18:49.519
that a tiger doesn't change
his stripes.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.347
I mean, she really talked a lot.

18:51.391 --> 18:54.568
I would doubt me if I were you
as well. I would.

18:54.611 --> 18:58.137
But in the last two weeks,
my wife almost died of cancer,

18:58.180 --> 19:01.575
and, well, I lost my
closest friend in the world.

19:01.618 --> 19:04.186
So I didn't change.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.405
I've been changed.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.494
I'm sorry for your loss.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.060
Thank you.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.062
All right, well, go ahead.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.803
I'm all ears.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.678
This is what
I'm thinking.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.203
That's impressive.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.163
Much more than anyone's ever
offered me in the past.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.860
I know.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.862
But you see, this is just money.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.864
Now, farming that land--

19:29.907 --> 19:31.344
well, it makes me happy.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.868
Well, now, that's why this is
only half of the offer.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.609
There's a spot up
in South Carolina

19:35.652 --> 19:37.611
near the water,
where I own acres of land.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.352
More than you have here.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.397
I'll pay you the money
and give you this land.

19:42.703 --> 19:45.053
Well, I've always wanted
to live near the water.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.055
Deal.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.146
LAWYER:
Hey, big guy, what's up?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.408
Triple the offer
I made to Korosh.

19:52.452 --> 19:53.496
Really? Why?

19:53.540 --> 19:55.106
Because Nolan's gonna
double his.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.108
What's going on with
the new marketing plan?

19:57.152 --> 19:58.327
LAWYER: Who's that?I haven't seen any billboards

19:58.371 --> 20:00.155
Jeff?and I've driven
all over Atlanta.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.156
Hello?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.288
And-and throw in some language

20:02.331 --> 20:03.376
about performance bonuses.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.334
Okay, will do.Thanks.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.553
I told you,

20:06.596 --> 20:07.597
no billboards;
they're a waste of money.

20:07.641 --> 20:08.946
But I did buy you a table

20:08.990 --> 20:10.557
at the Designer Institute Ball.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.949
It's a place to see and be seen.

20:11.993 --> 20:14.474
I need to be seen
by the masses,

20:14.517 --> 20:15.910
not the snotty
tastemakers.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.607
I'm getting a headache.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.218
[sighs]

20:19.261 --> 20:21.176
Don't worry, I'll figure out
something on my own.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.265
TV REPORTER:
And from the beaches of Bali

20:23.309 --> 20:25.180
to the pink sands
of the Bahamas...What the...?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.008
Turn this up.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.532
...billionaire Nolan Jamison
lunching with

20:29.576 --> 20:32.100
an unidentified friend
on the deck of his...

20:32.143 --> 20:33.580
That's Korosh.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.277
What is this show?

20:35.321 --> 20:36.583
Hot Tea Atlanta.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.367
Covers all of the movers
and shakers in the city.

20:38.411 --> 20:41.240
So it's a show about parties,
socialites and rich people?

20:41.283 --> 20:43.329
It's a great escape
for an overworked brain.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.113
Don't be judgy.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.463
[knocks on door]

20:47.507 --> 20:48.943
You were looking for me?

20:48.986 --> 20:51.554
And here you are.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.603
A token of my appreciation

20:56.646 --> 20:58.300
for saving Cristal's life.

21:00.171 --> 21:04.350
To remind us time is
a luxury.

21:04.393 --> 21:06.221
Wow
Thank you, Father.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.267
It's, uh...
It's nice to be appreciated.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.181
What does that mean?

21:10.225 --> 21:12.967
Just after everything
I've done at the hospital,

21:13.010 --> 21:15.622
the board is being difficult.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.450
I'm handling it, but...You know, no offense,

21:17.493 --> 21:18.581
but that hospital,
it's small potatoes.

21:18.625 --> 21:22.368
Come work with me
as equal partners.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.239
Primetime Air is gonna usher in

21:24.283 --> 21:26.372
a new era of
the Carrington Dynasty.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.460
Let's build it together.

21:27.503 --> 21:30.201
This is unexpected.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.594
Well...

21:31.638 --> 21:35.337
At the moment, I have
something really big going on

21:35.381 --> 21:37.339
at the hospital; I want
to see how it pans out.

21:37.383 --> 21:41.604
Do you want to change
the face of private aviation,

21:41.648 --> 21:43.606
make a ton of money
and have actual power?

21:43.650 --> 21:46.392
Or do you want to be mired
in bureaucratic red tape,

21:46.435 --> 21:50.352
where people don't appreciate
you like they should? Huh?

21:50.396 --> 21:51.527
Think about it.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.224
Let me know.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.362
Fallon, I don't know how
you did it, but thank you.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.494
[gasps] Ooh!

22:01.537 --> 22:03.583
Chocolate cake.
Best cure for a headache.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.149
First, what did you do?

22:05.193 --> 22:07.500
Second, are you okay?
Do we need to call a doctor?

22:07.543 --> 22:09.153
I'm modeling at the ball.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.112
Did you know the year
after Kaia Gerber did it,

22:11.155 --> 22:14.333
she booked every runway
during New York Fashion Week?

22:14.376 --> 22:15.856
Ugh, I shouldn't be
eating chocolate cake.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.684
I need to go practice my walk
because my arches collapsed

22:17.727 --> 22:20.034
during my...

22:20.077 --> 22:21.165
vacation.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.472
[chuckles]
Later.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.217
Did she just call
a two-week coma a "vacation"?

22:29.260 --> 22:31.393
I think "coma" may be
a trigger word for her.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.222
I think "vacation" is
a trigger word for us.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.355
You are so busy
pushing her out into the world

22:36.398 --> 22:38.226
before she's ready,
you can't see the red flags

22:38.269 --> 22:39.270
waving all over.

22:39.314 --> 22:41.055
I am not pushing her.

22:41.098 --> 22:43.013
I want her to get better.
I need her to get better.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.276
She threatened to go back
to her drug friends

22:45.320 --> 22:47.235
if I didn't get
her this job.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.716
Besides, everyone mourns
in different ways, Judge Judy.

22:49.759 --> 22:52.240
Oh, wow, you sure I can't
get you some powdered sugar

22:52.283 --> 22:53.328
to top that off?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.982
Why would I want
any powdered sugar,

22:55.025 --> 22:56.026
or any kind of powder?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.854
Whoa. It was a joke.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.814
I don't know, maybe this is what
Kirby needs to move forward.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.119
You know, who are
we to stop her?

23:02.163 --> 23:03.382
Her friends.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.035
Exactly.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.298
Which is why I bought us
a table at the ball.

23:08.430 --> 23:12.652
Looks like you got some sun
in the Bahamas.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.393
Huh. You tailing me?
Nah.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.873
But the tabloid shows are.Ah.

23:16.917 --> 23:19.310
I saw you took Korosh.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.704
Well played.

23:23.837 --> 23:27.231
Mm. You realize he's just
gonna play us against each other

23:27.275 --> 23:29.712
until he gets way more
than he deserves.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.627
Unless one of us backs off.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.324
When have you ever known me
to back off anything?

23:33.368 --> 23:34.848
Ah, there's always a first time.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.807
Come on, what's it gonna take?
Name your price.

23:37.851 --> 23:41.332
You still haven't learned
that I can't be bought off.

23:41.376 --> 23:45.902
But I am willing
to make it more interesting.

23:45.946 --> 23:47.208
I don't have time
for interesting.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.428
Let's drop this back and forth
and settle it

23:49.471 --> 23:51.691
with a one-time bet.

23:51.734 --> 23:54.041
Loser drops out,
winner can hire Korosh.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.259
What kind of bet?

23:55.303 --> 23:58.349
Let's see...
Robot battle.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.003
My bot's in the shop.

24:00.047 --> 24:03.267
Okay. Regatta.
Miami to the Bahamas.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.183
Mm, no. But I do have
a toy car that's undefeated.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.011
[chuckles]

24:08.055 --> 24:09.665
I got it.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.755
And if memory serves,
it's something you love to do,

24:12.799 --> 24:14.757
and you do well.What are you talking about?

24:14.801 --> 24:16.106
You remember
that tech conference

24:16.150 --> 24:17.194
we attended in Hungary?

24:17.238 --> 24:18.848
Ah.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.763
Mm-hmm.[laughs]

24:20.807 --> 24:23.026
You really want to
go down like that?

24:23.070 --> 24:24.811
It's fine with me.

24:24.854 --> 24:27.074
I just hope you
don't get hurt.

24:35.865 --> 24:39.086
â™ª We can go all night together

24:39.129 --> 24:41.088
â™ª Come onâ™ª

24:41.131 --> 24:45.266
â™ª Worry 'bout your nine
to five some other day â™ª

24:45.309 --> 24:47.747
â™ª Bust into a good time,
baby... â™ª

24:47.790 --> 24:50.750
Dominique Deveraux,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.012
founder of Dom-Mystique,

24:52.055 --> 24:53.753
one of the ten best new brands
of the year.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.232
They're waiting on me.
Thank you.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.713
â™ª Bubbly, all that bubbly...

24:57.757 --> 24:59.236
FALLON:
Sorry I'm late.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.717
I just ran into Paloma,
who wouldn't stop talking.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.893
She seems a little on edge.

25:03.937 --> 25:06.069
How are you doing?
Have you eaten anything today?

25:06.113 --> 25:09.029
Not really.
I'm a little nervous.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.770
Everyone in fashion is here.

25:10.813 --> 25:13.076
Isn't that the dream
scenario, though?Yeah.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.078
I mean, it's what
you wanted, right?

25:15.122 --> 25:16.166
Remember?

25:16.210 --> 25:17.907
You're right.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.083
It is. I'll be fine.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.869
How many pounds of extensions
are you wearing?

25:22.912 --> 25:24.174
I don't know, but my hair
looks amazing

25:24.218 --> 25:25.436
so it's worth the headache.

25:25.480 --> 25:26.960
We should have asked
the doctor about

25:27.003 --> 25:28.048
the effects of extensions.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.310
You're sure you're okay, right?

25:29.353 --> 25:32.531
WOMAN:
It's showtime, people.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.271
Never better.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.099
â™ª Some other day

25:36.143 --> 25:38.058
â™ª Bust into a good time...

25:38.101 --> 25:40.930
Maybe people do mourn
in different ways.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.932
Exactly.

25:42.976 --> 25:45.979
â™ª

25:56.467 --> 25:58.469
Rules?

25:58.513 --> 26:01.472
Three periods,
three minutes each period.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.997
Fencer with the most points
at the end is the winner.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.259
â™ª

26:11.004 --> 26:12.179
En garde!

26:12.222 --> 26:14.485
â™ª You get up every morning Pret allez.

26:14.529 --> 26:15.922
â™ª From the alarm clock's
warning â™ª

26:15.965 --> 26:19.012
â™ª Take the 8:15 into the city

26:19.055 --> 26:21.884
â™ª There's a whistle up above

26:21.928 --> 26:23.538
â™ª People pushing,
people shoving â™ª

26:23.582 --> 26:25.061
â™ª And the girls,
who try to look pretty... â™ª[beeps]

26:25.105 --> 26:27.150
I love that dress.

26:27.194 --> 26:30.414
The cut just looks
absolutely gorgeous on her

26:30.458 --> 26:34.157
with that slit-- Hi.
Who are you wearing

26:34.201 --> 26:35.376
and what can you tell
the Hot Tea Atlantaviewers

26:35.419 --> 26:37.160
about the designer?

26:37.204 --> 26:40.990
I'm wearing me. This is a custom
Dom-Mystique gown,

26:41.034 --> 26:43.906
inspired by a design
of my mother's.

26:43.950 --> 26:47.083
A personal story.
I love that.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.216
Wouldn't we all love
to have a designer

26:49.259 --> 26:51.000
create something personal
just for us?

26:51.044 --> 26:53.873
But that's not an option
for most people.Oh, tell me about it.

26:53.916 --> 26:57.224
But I am proof that you don't
have to spend a fortune

26:57.267 --> 27:00.183
to look like the belle
of the ball.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.533
â™ª And I'll be taking care
of business â™ª

27:02.577 --> 27:04.144
â™ª Every day

27:04.187 --> 27:06.320
â™ª Taking care of business

27:06.363 --> 27:09.845
â™ª Every way, I been taking care
of business â™ª

27:09.889 --> 27:11.847
â™ª It's all mine...

27:11.891 --> 27:13.936
All tied up.
Next point wins.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.200
â™ª And working overtime,
work out â™ª

27:17.244 --> 27:18.941
Oh! Oh!

27:18.985 --> 27:20.551
Point and match.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.553
[breathing heavily]

27:22.597 --> 27:25.034
â™ª Taking care of business

27:25.078 --> 27:27.428
TouchÃ©.â™ª Taking care of business

27:27.471 --> 27:29.996
A deal's a deal.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.301
I'll back off.â™ª Taking care of business

27:31.345 --> 27:33.086
Well done.

27:33.129 --> 27:36.611
â™ª Taking care of business.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.919
[indistinct chatter]

27:50.930 --> 27:54.107
Hey, uh, I'm having
second thoughts

27:54.150 --> 27:55.412
about the whole dumpster thing.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.893
I think I may stop there
on the way home.

27:57.937 --> 28:00.374
I... I'll talk to you later.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.202
WOMAN:
My father, who founded
the Designer Institute,

28:02.245 --> 28:05.161
has been an inspiration to me
throughout my life.

28:05.205 --> 28:07.468
Without his unconditional
love and support,

28:07.511 --> 28:09.513
I wouldn't be here today
to give all of you...

28:09.557 --> 28:10.514
What's the matter?

28:10.558 --> 28:12.952
Where's my water bottle?

28:12.995 --> 28:14.388
I left a water right there,

28:14.431 --> 28:16.172
next to my bag.Here's a new one.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.261
I don't want that water,
I want mywater!

28:18.305 --> 28:19.610
What?

28:19.654 --> 28:21.090
What?

28:22.265 --> 28:24.224
Wait a minute, give me that.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.617
This is vodka.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.532
You've been drinking vodka
all night?

28:28.576 --> 28:29.925
Well, yeah, it's a party.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.187
What did you think
I was drinking, apple juice?

28:31.231 --> 28:32.754
We thought you were
drinking water

28:32.798 --> 28:35.278
because you said you were
drinking water, like, six times.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.628
It's not a big deal. I knew
you guys would overreact.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.108
It is a big deal.

28:39.152 --> 28:41.502
You just spent two weeks
in a coma, not on vacation.

28:41.545 --> 28:43.460
We were worried,
and now we're more worried.

28:43.504 --> 28:46.463
What are you doing here
when you need to be out there?

28:46.507 --> 28:48.117
I can't do it.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.728
That is not an option.

28:49.771 --> 28:50.946
Don't yell at me.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.295
No, stop yelling at her.Don't yell at her.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.428
What am I doing here?

28:54.471 --> 28:55.995
I didn't even get to say
good-bye to my father.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.387
I just want to go home.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.520
Are you kidding me?
Come on, young lady.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.174
No, please!FALLON: Kirby!

29:01.217 --> 29:02.479
SAM:
Watch out.
[Kirby cries out]

29:02.523 --> 29:05.526
[onlookers gasp]I'm fine.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.180
Can everyone just
leave me alone?

29:13.403 --> 29:15.014
You were pushing her so hard.

29:15.057 --> 29:17.451
I told you she wasn't
ready for this.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.759
Maybe we should take
this conversation into the hall.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.412
[scoffs] Please.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.763
We could be under the covers
with her, she wouldn't notice.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.068
You were stage-mommying
so hard.

29:26.112 --> 29:28.462
Even for you
it was aggressive.

29:28.505 --> 29:30.507
I just wanted to help
Kirby be okay.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.988
And now she's dealt
with Anders' death,

29:33.032 --> 29:35.599
just like the rest of us;
she should thank me, really.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.687
Have you dealt with it?

29:36.731 --> 29:38.689
Because you haven't
mentioned it

29:38.733 --> 29:40.474
since the funeral.

29:40.517 --> 29:41.823
What's there to say?

29:41.867 --> 29:43.477
How much you miss him.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.957
What a great guy he was.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.656
I'm not nottalking about it.Fallon...

29:48.699 --> 29:50.005
you have either been working

29:50.049 --> 29:51.790
or focusing on Kirby 24/7.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.704
That's exactly what you do
when you don't want to deal.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.445
I want to the funeral.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.925
I said good-bye.

29:56.969 --> 29:59.014
That doesn't mean
you've accepted anything.

29:59.058 --> 30:01.016
I'm fine.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.714
And now Kirby is, too, okay?

30:03.758 --> 30:05.891
I'm gonna get her
another blanket.

30:16.858 --> 30:19.948
Maybe she's not as fine
as I thought.

30:25.736 --> 30:28.783
[phone ringing][exhales sharply]

30:31.917 --> 30:33.875
Dr. Bridges.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.095
Did you have a chance
to review my data?

30:40.099 --> 30:42.144
That-That's what I thought.

30:42.188 --> 30:44.755
I agree.
I-I think this could be

30:44.799 --> 30:47.062
a huge breakthrough for me,

30:47.106 --> 30:49.804
and maybe the world.

30:49.848 --> 30:54.853
There are some promising new
developments at the hospital.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.987
I'd like to see them through,
because if things work out,

30:59.031 --> 31:02.121
let's just say you won't be
the only one with a new dynasty.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.645
Betting on yourself.
Can't argue with that.

31:04.688 --> 31:05.820
I know it's a risk.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.475
I really want to create
my own legacy.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.999
My last name can help
get me in the door,

31:11.043 --> 31:14.133
but I need to be able
to kick them down myself.

31:18.180 --> 31:22.619
And I would like for us
to work on

31:22.663 --> 31:24.839
building
a better relationship.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.536
I would like that, too.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.712
So you're not mad
that I said no?

31:28.756 --> 31:30.714
Not at all. No.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.238
Good luck.

31:37.199 --> 31:39.636
Sales are booming

31:39.680 --> 31:43.510
after my Hot Tea Atlanta
appearance earlier this evening.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.947
See? You think a billboard
would have done that?

31:45.991 --> 31:49.603
So, how much did you pay
the Hot Tea Atlantareporter

31:49.646 --> 31:51.735
to interview me?I didn't pay the reporter.

31:51.779 --> 31:54.869
So it was a coincidence
that you saw the show,

31:54.913 --> 31:57.219
and the reporter suddenly
took an interest

31:57.263 --> 31:58.829
in who I was wearing?

31:58.873 --> 32:01.049
It's true, I look stunning.

32:01.093 --> 32:03.486
But I wouldn't exactly say
I'm a Kardashian

32:03.530 --> 32:04.444
on the fame scale.

32:04.487 --> 32:07.055
I didn't pay the reporter.

32:07.099 --> 32:09.971
But I did buy the company.
You mad?

32:10.015 --> 32:14.715
Mad? You should see
our new sales projections.

32:14.758 --> 32:17.239
This feels like a move
out of my own playbook.

32:17.283 --> 32:20.155
Not sure if I should be
flattered or insulted.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.852
But you should have
told me the truth,

32:21.896 --> 32:23.680
just like you can tell me
what's bothering you now.

32:23.724 --> 32:26.596
Did you not hire
the scientist?
I did not.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.644
I don't get what's so important
about this man.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.907
There are a million ways for you

32:32.951 --> 32:34.517
to make your company
more efficient.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.997
That's not what this is about.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.651
Then what is it about?

32:39.783 --> 32:41.785
You want honesty?

32:41.829 --> 32:44.527
I had a vision on that retreat
a while back.

32:44.571 --> 32:47.182
I'm worried about this planet.

32:47.226 --> 32:51.534
So I want to build a rocket
and send it into space.

32:51.578 --> 32:54.755
There's resources on other
planets that can benefit us.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.757
It sounds crazy, I know.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.803
Which is why I haven't told you.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.109
Or anyone else.

33:01.153 --> 33:03.111
But other people are trying
to do this.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.200
It's not crazy.Yeah, but those people

33:05.244 --> 33:08.203
are the same three billionaires
that everyone knows.

33:08.247 --> 33:09.683
A Black billionaire doing this

33:09.726 --> 33:12.207
is a whole different
conversation.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.774
I just lost the one
scientist I needed

33:13.817 --> 33:15.602
to make this a reality.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.778
I mean,
our resources are limited.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.736
There's overpopulation,
there's...

33:19.780 --> 33:23.001
I'm on a high.
Don't bring me down.

33:23.044 --> 33:26.178
The problems are overwhelming,
I know,

33:26.221 --> 33:27.744
but I want to fix them.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.920
And the scientist doesn't like
your ideas?

33:29.964 --> 33:32.227
He doesn't know
about the rocket part.

33:32.271 --> 33:36.318
If he doesn't know your dream...

33:36.362 --> 33:38.016
how can he help you get there?

33:40.627 --> 33:44.326
Okay. Well, I miss you.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.633
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

34:00.168 --> 34:03.911
ANDERS:
Fallon, I know you can do this.

34:03.954 --> 34:06.261
I've been aware of
how special you are

34:06.305 --> 34:08.872
since you could first walk.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.614
I'm proud of you, as always.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.225
Anders.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.760
On a scale of one to ten,
how much do you hate me?

34:26.803 --> 34:27.978
Ten being I should start running

34:28.022 --> 34:29.371
before you throw a Manolo
at my head.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.330
I'm not upset with you at all.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.071
Really?

34:33.114 --> 34:35.943
From what I can remember,
about last night,

34:35.986 --> 34:37.988
which is not a lot,
thank God,

34:38.032 --> 34:39.338
Paloma was furious.

34:39.381 --> 34:40.730
And everyone knows
if you piss her off

34:40.774 --> 34:41.731
you're as good as dead.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.211
I don't care about Paloma.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.865
I care about you.

34:44.908 --> 34:47.128
I just wanted
you to be okay

34:47.172 --> 34:50.000
because...

34:50.044 --> 34:53.830
if you were okay,
then maybe I could be, too.

34:53.874 --> 34:56.181
You're not okay?

34:57.878 --> 34:59.314
I thought I was.

34:59.358 --> 35:04.232
But, well, turns out
I needed an ugly cry, too.

35:04.276 --> 35:05.712
[chuckles]

35:05.755 --> 35:07.192
Aren't ugly cries
the best sometimes?

35:09.063 --> 35:11.326
The truth is...

35:11.370 --> 35:15.025
I feel guilty
that your father died

35:15.069 --> 35:16.288
on the day he saved my life.

35:16.331 --> 35:18.203
I mean, he must have
been exhausted.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.683
What if that had something to do
with the crash?

35:20.727 --> 35:23.164
Get that thought out
of your head right now. Okay?

35:23.208 --> 35:25.775
He loved you,
and he would save you again,

35:25.819 --> 35:26.994
even with the same outcome.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.779
Thank you, Kirby.

35:29.823 --> 35:32.304
Now, go get dressed.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.044
We have to go somewhere.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.137
NOLAN:
So you want to send
a rocket into space?

35:39.180 --> 35:42.183
Yes. And I want to build it
so it can be manned.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.272
Now I see why
you needed Korosh,

35:44.316 --> 35:46.405
because of his background
in frozen fuels,

35:46.448 --> 35:48.842
which your ex-wife
obviously told you

35:48.885 --> 35:52.237
was my company's focus after
our date a couple weeks ago.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.717
Look, man, you won
fair and square.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.763
I just wanted you to know

35:56.806 --> 35:58.895
it's not a game to me.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.071
I'm looking to make an impact
on the world.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.726
Why didn't you tell me this
in the first place?

36:03.770 --> 36:05.467
I don't like sending ideas
out into the world

36:05.511 --> 36:06.816
until they're ready.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.254
I get that.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.777
And if anyone can do this,

36:10.820 --> 36:12.257
it's you.
Besides,

36:12.300 --> 36:14.041
someone needs
to shut Elon Musk up.

36:14.084 --> 36:16.130
[both laugh]

36:16.174 --> 36:17.740
Hey, why don't you join me, huh?

36:17.784 --> 36:19.960
Two billionaires are
better than one.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.875
Thanks, I'll pass.

36:21.918 --> 36:24.225
I enjoyed the competition,
but I don't need Korosh,

36:24.269 --> 36:25.879
and clearly you do.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.272
So what's the next step?

36:27.315 --> 36:30.100
I head to Washington
and ask Congress for funding.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.754
You're gonna hear a lot of noes.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.408
Then I'll fund it myself.

36:33.452 --> 36:34.931
Be careful.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.325
There were times
when I was building my company

36:37.369 --> 36:40.285
that I had two weeks before
I completely ran out of money.

36:40.328 --> 36:43.505
Actually, that was when
things were most fun.

36:43.549 --> 36:44.898
[chuckles]

36:44.941 --> 36:47.248
But put something away offshore,
just in case.

36:47.292 --> 36:50.512
Oh, don't worry,
I got it covered.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.471
I can't believe I did that.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.124
So now what?

36:54.168 --> 36:57.215
Now I take a shower,
and never speak of the time

36:57.258 --> 36:59.478
I climbed into a dumpster again.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.044
Then I have to get this to Leo
without him knowing

37:01.088 --> 37:02.220
we ever had it.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.786
Why didn't we just
do that first?

37:03.830 --> 37:06.093
Because I've never had to deal
with a problem like this before.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.269
Geez.I need a drink.

37:12.534 --> 37:17.017
"Mr. Jones, a package for me
was delivered a few days ago

37:17.060 --> 37:19.193
to the club
instead of the hotel."

37:19.237 --> 37:20.455
What's that?

37:20.499 --> 37:22.022
It's a note from
your head chef.

37:22.065 --> 37:24.329
"Special cassava root flour.

37:24.372 --> 37:27.288
Packs of it."

37:27.332 --> 37:29.464
Which would look like...

37:29.508 --> 37:31.292
It was flour.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.120
Did I really just pack

37:33.163 --> 37:35.253
five to seven years' worth
of worry lines

37:35.296 --> 37:38.299
into two days
because of a box of flour?

37:38.343 --> 37:40.040
I ate a half a box of doughnuts.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.303
Okay, it was a whole box.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.826
Look, we need to do something.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.220
Even when he's not around,
the stress of having Leo

37:46.264 --> 37:47.482
in our lives is killing us.

37:47.526 --> 37:49.092
I know.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.225
I mean, seriously, look.
Is there a bald patch?

37:51.269 --> 37:53.445
[grunts][phone chimes, vibrates]

37:53.488 --> 37:56.274
Oh, I don't think
we have a choice.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.188
We need to get rid of Leo
once and for all,

37:58.232 --> 38:01.540
or he's gonna get rid of us.

38:06.893 --> 38:09.243
I like slowing things
down a little.
It's nice.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.984
Maybe next time we can have
breakfast in bed.

38:11.027 --> 38:14.204
Hold the breakfast.[phone chiming]

38:16.555 --> 38:18.034
Oh, it's my lawyer.

38:18.078 --> 38:20.254
Hang on, it'll only
take a second.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.606
Mitchell, talk to me.

38:24.650 --> 38:27.174
What? Indicted?
This is ridiculous.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.350
Actual jail time?

38:29.394 --> 38:31.526
Hey, hey, at the risk
of sounding insensitive,

38:31.570 --> 38:34.616
Garth and I had a deal pending.
Is that moving forward?

38:37.010 --> 38:39.447
What's wrong?

38:39.491 --> 38:41.362
Garth Wheeler.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.146
He's been indicted
for massive tax fraud.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.147
The deal's off.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.236
The land has been designated

38:46.280 --> 38:47.542
as protected parkland.

38:47.586 --> 38:51.329
Blake, I'm so sorry.
Maybe we can...

38:51.372 --> 38:52.895
Mitch says it's done.

38:52.939 --> 38:55.681
So you'll find land
in a different location.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.900
You'll build that airport.Location is everything.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.554
This location.

38:59.598 --> 39:03.384
This is my punishment
for doing things the right way.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.647
KIRBY:
This spot's so peaceful.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.390
My dad would like it.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.698
FALLON:
The trees remind me
of that weekend,

39:12.741 --> 39:14.613
you know, when we took
that camping trip

39:14.656 --> 39:16.528
with our Girl Scout troop.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.921
Anders had to step in
when my mother realized

39:18.965 --> 39:21.837
chaperoning meant
it would be a dry weekend.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.274
I remember.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.928
It was the first time
he had s'mores,

39:25.972 --> 39:28.191
and he loved them.
[sniffles]

39:28.235 --> 39:30.672
He always made them for me
when I had a bad day.

39:30.716 --> 39:33.545
He said s'mores can get you
through anything.

39:33.588 --> 39:37.375
Well, s'mores and
a pocketknife. [chuckles]

39:37.418 --> 39:41.727
He really was obsessed with us
learning survival skills.

39:41.770 --> 39:44.643
We got our merit
badges that weekend.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.645
He was so proud.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.301
I always thought
I'd have more time

39:51.345 --> 39:53.260
to make him proud again.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.395
I can't believe
I missed his funeral.

39:57.438 --> 40:00.441
I feel so guilty.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.661
Is that why
you've been drinking?

40:08.275 --> 40:10.973
I'm really sorry, Kirby.

40:11.017 --> 40:12.540
I guess I just didn't
want to face the fact

40:12.584 --> 40:13.541
that you were struggling.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.978
It's okay.

40:16.022 --> 40:19.286
I need to take responsibility,
too.

40:21.331 --> 40:22.289
Can I, uh...

40:22.332 --> 40:23.333
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Of course.

40:29.949 --> 40:32.299
[sniffles]

40:36.999 --> 40:39.872
You know, grief is
a useless emotion, Kirby.

40:44.398 --> 40:46.444
But I still feel it.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.489
There are no merit badges
for guilt.

40:48.533 --> 40:51.492
I could maybe get you one
for moving on

40:51.536 --> 40:52.928
and taking care of yourself.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.582
So you're not mad?

40:54.626 --> 40:56.454
Every time we have
an argument,

40:56.497 --> 40:58.499
we always come back
together again.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.719
This would have been the same.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.590
You'll always be my daughter.

41:02.634 --> 41:05.506
We just ran out of time
on this one.

41:07.334 --> 41:11.773
Now go live
a big, beautiful life.

41:11.817 --> 41:13.645
And get yourself
a pocketknife.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.349
[exhales, sniffles]

41:23.829 --> 41:26.309
Coming here was
exactly what I needed.

41:26.353 --> 41:29.791
But, um, I just need
to make one more stop.

41:29.835 --> 41:32.402
Rehab.

41:32.446 --> 41:34.100
I'm a mess.

41:40.846 --> 41:43.022
I'm sorry, you just weren't
performing up to my standards.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.024
I told you this would take time.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.808
Well, now it'll take
someone else's time.

41:46.852 --> 41:47.853
You're done here.

41:47.896 --> 41:49.681
We appreciate all of
your hard work,

41:49.724 --> 41:51.421
but that box
is gonna stay here.

41:51.465 --> 41:52.988
All of your research
and testing,

41:53.032 --> 41:56.383
that's property
of the hospital. Now...

41:59.038 --> 42:00.039
Oh, good luck in the future.
