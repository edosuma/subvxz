I don't know
what you talkin' 'bout.

Do you know
what he talkin' 'bout, Sam?

Why, we just here

you want us to.

11:16.817 --> 11:18.791
How many times
do I have to tell people,

11:18.875 --> 11:21.321
just because we're dressed
like Confederate soldiers

11:21.355 --> 11:22.923
doesn't mean
we're pro slavery?

11:22.957 --> 11:25.125
We're just here to preserve

11:25.159 --> 11:27.861
the pure and beautiful slice
of southern history.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.364
Yeah, pure and beautiful...

Yeah, just stop it.

13:03.958 --> 13:05.058
It's just a piece of paper.

13:05.092 --> 13:06.727
We gotta keep its integrity,

We're special. We're magic.
Whoa, yay, we all live in here.

13:15.269 --> 13:16.636
All right,
the most important thing

13:16.671 --> 13:18.405
is that we don't
get too far apart.

And-- and-- and I know--
I know that there's--

there's gotta be at least
one woman in this room

Hurdle is not jumping.

Okay, well, we-- we-- we--
we just want to remind the kids

19:20.366 --> 19:22.700
that of course,
you cannot actually fly, kids.

19:22.735 --> 19:24.502
Yo, screw that
negativity, man!

19:24.536 --> 19:27.871
Hey, boys and girls,
ages 8 through 12!

19:27.906 --> 19:31.575
Yo, don't let nobody ever tell
you what you can and cannot do!

19:31.610 --> 19:35.012
All the preteen children
out there, listen to my voice!

19:35.047 --> 19:37.482
You are immortal!

19:37.516 --> 19:39.484
Okay, well, obviously,
we understand that Charlie...

19:39.518 --> 19:41.586
- (groaning, shouting)
- is super excited right now,

19:41.620 --> 19:44.689
and that no one is actually
immortal, nobody at all.

19:44.723 --> 19:46.023
Hey, kids!

19:46.057 --> 19:47.992
You can turn yourself
into a car

19:48.026 --> 19:50.860
and have a friend
drive you onto the freeway!

19:50.895 --> 19:52.195
Okay, no-- Well, that's
just a metaphor, kids.

19:52.229 --> 19:53.763
- It's not!
- Just a metaphor--

19:53.798 --> 19:56.032
You still have the power
of childish innocence!

19:56.067 --> 19:57.868
Get a friend on your back,

19:57.902 --> 20:01.238
and make a beeline for the next
ramp to the freeway, y'all!

20:01.272 --> 20:02.606
- Okay, don't do any--
- To the freeway!

20:02.640 --> 20:04.508
He's speaking
figuratively, folks.

20:04.542 --> 20:07.445
Once you get there, ain't
nothing figurative about this!

20:07.479 --> 20:10.081
You will turn into a robot!

20:10.115 --> 20:12.516
First and foremost,
I just want to say

20:12.550 --> 20:17.053
to all the families
who lost children, I'm sorry.

20:17.087 --> 20:20.023
My statements
were irresponsible.

20:20.057 --> 20:22.526
I have subsequently
looked up

20:22.560 --> 20:26.597
the terms "literally"
and "metaphorically,"

20:26.631 --> 20:30.568
and found that whereas
I was not incorrect,

20:30.602 --> 20:33.070
they did not mean
what I thought they meant.

20:33.104 --> 20:34.297
(applause)

20:34.373 --> 20:36.073
But-- And that-- You know
another thing I love?

20:36.107 --> 20:39.610
I love-- I love--
no athlete ever thanks his dad.

20:39.644 --> 20:40.587
- (laughs)
- No.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.493
Mom, I love you!
I love you, ma!

20:42.552 --> 20:43.719
Mom, I love you, man!

20:43.778 --> 20:44.863
Dad, where the [bleep]
were ya?

20:44.934 --> 20:47.335
Where are you, dad?
(laughter, applause)

20:47.369 --> 20:49.130
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, thank you very much.

20:49.189 --> 20:50.222
Thank you so much
for coming.

20:50.257 --> 20:52.558
(cheers and applause)

20:52.592 --> 20:54.123
