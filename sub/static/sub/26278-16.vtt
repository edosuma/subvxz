00:48.348 --> 00:50.249
- How many this time?

00:52.987 --> 00:55.754
- 12. It's double
our last attendance.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.689
- Wonderful. At this rate,

00:57.691 --> 01:00.359
we'll have a best-seller
in 40 years.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.362
- There is not a lot of people,
but the ones that are here

01:04.432 --> 01:06.532
are very much looking forward
to your reading.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.977
Ahem. I know you're all

01:19.046 --> 01:20.812
dying to hear Detective Murdoch

01:20.848 --> 01:24.116
read from his and Dr. Ogden's
new book. Let's have

01:24.185 --> 01:27.653
a big round of applause for
Toronto's most famous detective!

01:33.393 --> 01:35.594
- Good evening.
Thank you for coming.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.730
Each chapter in our book

01:38.732 --> 01:41.533
recounts a different
murder investigation.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.802
Chapter one

01:44.839 --> 01:48.806
is about a most peculiar case...

01:48.843 --> 01:51.809
<i> It was a bright, sunny day</i>

01:51.846 --> 01:54.413
<i> on July 16th, 1904,</i>

01:54.548 --> 01:56.615
<i> when strollers</i>

01:56.684 --> 01:58.750
<i> at Cawthra Park happened upon</i>

01:58.786 --> 02:00.685
<i> a most unusual statue.</i>

02:00.721 --> 02:03.689
- There's really nothing to...
nothing to see here!

02:03.824 --> 02:05.624
Just stay back!

02:05.626 --> 02:07.426
- Where did the statue
come from?

02:07.428 --> 02:10.094
- No one knows. It certainly
wasn't commissioned.

02:10.131 --> 02:13.565
- A nude not commissioned
by our city fathers.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.300
Why am I not surprised?

02:15.435 --> 02:18.637
I must say, it's very good.
She looks almost real.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.606
Hysteria is clearly
what the artist intended.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.707
- No, sir! Sir, get back here!

02:22.776 --> 02:25.710
- This vulgar display is
an affront to decency!

02:25.779 --> 02:29.681
- SIR! SIR! Give me that!

02:29.750 --> 02:33.652
Oh, my God...
Sir...

02:33.654 --> 02:36.721
Doctor...
- What is it, George?

02:36.757 --> 02:39.724
- I believe this is
no ordinary work of art.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.127
- The statue was, in fact,

02:42.196 --> 02:45.597
the electro-plated body
of a young woman.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.066
(gasping and whispering)

02:50.070 --> 02:51.937
Excuse me.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.838
What is it, Henry?
- The owner of

02:53.908 --> 02:56.475
the Windsor House Hotel has
asked for you. She thinks

02:56.610 --> 02:59.277
she's found a body in her lobby.
- "She thinks"?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.413
- It's best that you come, sir.

03:04.151 --> 03:07.219
- You'll have to excuse us.

03:07.288 --> 03:11.289
We have an urgent matter
to attend to. Ahem.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.960
- Is it a... a murder?

03:14.962 --> 03:16.895
(giggling)

03:16.964 --> 03:20.098
- Possibly.
(murmurs of surprise)

03:20.134 --> 03:21.967
(chuckling)

03:21.969 --> 03:25.003
- The books are for
sale in the lobby.
- I'll take one!

03:28.308 --> 03:30.042
- Hello, Ms. Matthews.

03:30.177 --> 03:33.645
- Thank you for coming. I hope
this isn't a waste of your time.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.580
- If it isn't
the famous detective

03:35.616 --> 03:38.717
and published author,
I'm to understand.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.919
- You remember
our hotel detective.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.055
- Mr. Fellows.
- We understand

03:43.190 --> 03:46.458
you've discovered a body.
- It was delivered anonymously

03:46.593 --> 03:49.261
to the lobby, and I told Ralph

03:49.263 --> 03:51.263
to have it carted away.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.832
- But I recognized it
for what it was.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.801
- Oh, my goodness. It--

03:56.837 --> 04:00.005
- I believe you'll find
it's an electro-plated body.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.739
- Just as in our book.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.009
- Have you read our book, then?

04:04.011 --> 04:06.745
- It may astonish the two of you
that the world

04:06.747 --> 04:08.880
doesn't revolve around just you.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.983
The case was in the newspapers.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.486
I think you'll need this.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.656
(tense music)

04:37.511 --> 04:40.178
- We were just reading
about this; it's chapter one.

04:40.247 --> 04:43.048
- It may be a coincidence.

04:43.050 --> 04:46.451
Mr. Fellows is right.
It was all over the newspaper.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.520
- In my professional opinion,

04:48.522 --> 04:50.789
this is the work of a copycat.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.790
- You're a hotel detective,
Mr. Fellows.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.593
Your professional opinion is
hardly required.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.528
- Nevertheless.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.397
- You may be correct,
Mr. Fellows.

04:58.532 --> 05:02.534
Is the killer copying
the newspapers or our book?

05:02.536 --> 05:04.903
(camera clicking)

05:04.905 --> 05:07.839
- (Brackenreid): During the
electroplating process,

05:07.875 --> 05:10.275
dissolved metals are drawn
by electrical attraction

05:10.410 --> 05:12.477
to form a thin, coherent coating

05:12.479 --> 05:14.846
on a surface of opposite charge.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.615
In this case, a waxy coating.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.484
- The waxy substance
likely contains

05:19.486 --> 05:23.155
a pulverized nitrate of silver.
The body is then immersed

05:23.157 --> 05:26.491
in copper sulfate and the
electrical current is applied.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.294
- The result is
a metallic mummy, as it were.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.295
- George, were you able
to find any information

05:31.332 --> 05:33.565
on electroplating facilities?
- Yes, sir. There's only one

05:33.634 --> 05:35.734
electroplating factory
in Toronto. We actually had

05:35.803 --> 05:38.470
cause to visit there
on another case some years ago.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.642
- An endeavour such as
this required a large
electrolyte bath,

05:43.644 --> 05:45.844
and the capacity
for large current draws,

05:45.846 --> 05:48.647
suggesting the killer made use
of a purpose-built factory.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.983
"James Kirkham's
electroplating facility

05:51.985 --> 05:53.852
"on Niagara Street provided

05:53.854 --> 05:56.254
the perfect means."
And there you have it.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.390
All the instructions

05:58.392 --> 06:00.258
on how to electroplate a body.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.594
You even gave
the killer the address.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.663
- Henry, head down to Kirkham's
factory and see if anyone's

06:05.699 --> 06:07.466
been in there after hours.
- Sir.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.801
(sighing)

06:09.837 --> 06:12.203
- It's horrific, but we must
face the possibility

06:12.272 --> 06:14.539
that the killer got
the idea from our book.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.942
- It shouldn't be too difficult
to obtain the identities

06:16.944 --> 06:18.810
of those who purchased the book.

06:18.945 --> 06:22.614
- Perhaps it's a good thing
that so few have sold.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.816
- Hmm.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.685
- I'm sorry, folks.
It is impossible to know

06:26.687 --> 06:28.954
who has the book now.
- But you told us

06:28.956 --> 06:32.423
we've only sold 12 copies.
- Sold, but we've given copies

06:32.459 --> 06:35.093
to libraries, police stations,
book reviewers.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.562
The number of people
with access to your book

06:37.564 --> 06:40.465
would be in the hundreds.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.436
(indistinct speaking)

06:44.571 --> 06:47.706
- Inspector Hamish Slorach! What
brings you to my station house?

06:47.841 --> 06:49.640
- I'm packing it in, Tom.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.310
Had a long talk with the dog,
and we decided it's time.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.212
- You're younger than me,
aren't you?

06:54.347 --> 06:57.182
- Oh, no, no. I'm just
better looking, and I
plan to keep it that way.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.917
- Well, the constabulary won't
be the same without you.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.119
- Ah. Well, I'm having
a little bash tomorrow night,

07:01.254 --> 07:03.387
and I would like you
to give the farewell speech.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.658
- Me?
- What, is there
a cop I've known longer? Huh?

07:06.727 --> 07:09.026
- Well, I'd be honoured.
- Thank you. Thank you. It means

07:09.062 --> 07:10.796
so much to me. It really does.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.799
Detective Murdoch! Oh, I was
hoping I'd run into you!

07:13.934 --> 07:17.068
I bought your book. Heh!
Soon as it came out. I couldn't

07:17.104 --> 07:19.204
put it down. Entertaining as
well as instructive.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.339
- Thank you.
- Can you imagine how many more

07:21.341 --> 07:23.408
criminals I would have caught
if I'd read this thing earlier?

07:23.410 --> 07:25.343
Boy oh boy, huh?
(chuckling)

07:25.345 --> 07:27.212
Can I get you to sign my copy?

07:27.281 --> 07:29.881
- Oh, certainly. Um...

07:30.016 --> 07:32.350
- Oh, allow me.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.053
I am the co-writer, after all.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.159
- To Hamish, my good friend.

07:42.196 --> 07:45.630
- Hamish. Good friend.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.165
- There's a man, huh?

07:48.202 --> 07:50.302
And I'd like to invite you to
my farewell bash tomorrow night.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.605
- Oh, you're retiring.
- Dying, actually.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.844
Just kidding!
I'll see you all there.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.645
Is this the way I came in?
- Yes.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.581
- OK.
(laughing)

08:04.251 --> 08:07.052
- Sir, Mr. Kirkham died last
April. His factory is closed,

08:07.187 --> 08:09.187
but the lock on the back door
was broken.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.055
- So, the killer
could have accessed

08:11.124 --> 08:13.191
the facility at any time
without detection.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.260
- Also, sir, a Mr. Robert Brown

08:15.329 --> 08:17.596
claims his daughter is missing.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.000
- That's my Amelia.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.569
What kind of monster would do
such a thing?

08:24.704 --> 08:26.738
- We intend to find out.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.144
- She was stabbed in the heart,
just as in your book.

08:33.213 --> 08:36.881
- Oh, you've read the book?
- The relevant passages.

08:36.950 --> 08:40.151
This page in particular.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.887
(door closing)
- "The victim had been stabbed

08:42.956 --> 08:45.490
in the heart,
but that's not how she died."

08:45.625 --> 08:47.359
<i> A single thrust to the heart.</i>

08:47.494 --> 08:49.761
The wound was very clean,
suggesting the knife was

08:49.896 --> 08:51.896
pushed in and withdrawn
at the same angle.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.366
- Which led you to believe
that she was incapacitated

08:54.501 --> 08:56.234
when she was killed.
- Yes. I analyzed

08:56.303 --> 08:58.436
the stomach contents.
She'd drunk and eaten shortly

08:58.438 --> 09:00.772
before she died.
I found significant amounts

09:00.774 --> 09:03.375
of the sedative sulfonyl.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.576
- He wanted her unconscious.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.912
- She died
approximately 18 hours ago.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.847
The killer waited until rigor

09:09.849 --> 09:11.783
had set in.
- And once rigor was

09:11.852 --> 09:14.386
fully in evidence, and the body
was fixed in the pose,

09:14.388 --> 09:16.521
he set about
the task of electroplating.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.591
It's quite the operation.
- She sat down to share

09:19.660 --> 09:22.160
a meal with her killer. It might
have been someone she knew.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.397
- I don't know
why you came to that conclusion.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.399
She could have
just as easily dined alone.

09:28.435 --> 09:31.336
- But in all other respects...

09:31.338 --> 09:33.871
- The meal, the sulfonyl
and the timing of the rigor

09:33.907 --> 09:36.174
are the same
in Amelia Brown's case.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.146
-<i> I raised her by myself.</i>

09:41.148 --> 09:43.415
She was a handful as a child,

09:43.550 --> 09:46.351
but she grew
into a fine young woman.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.520
I can think of no one
who would wish her harm.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.488
Although...

09:50.524 --> 09:52.624
I could name a few
who would wish harm on me.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.160
- How so?
- I've been with the Pinkerton

09:55.295 --> 09:57.362
Detective Agency for 30 years,

09:57.431 --> 10:00.565
and I've dealt with my share
of hoodlums and bad actors.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.168
- And you fear

10:03.170 --> 10:05.236
one of them may be
out for revenge?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.974
- Sir? We've found another body.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.277
(tense music)

10:12.279 --> 10:14.512
- His body was pulled
from the lake an hour ago.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.848
He appears to be
in his 60s or early 70s.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.651
He was struck
in the back of the head

10:19.720 --> 10:22.387
with a blunt instrument,
and then fell

10:22.456 --> 10:24.588
or was pushed
into the water and drowned.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.792
- So, not inspired by our book.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.727
- That's something of a relief.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.331
I know this man.
- You do?

10:33.466 --> 10:36.600
- Dr. Morley. He was a surgeon

10:36.637 --> 10:39.137
at Toronto General
for many years.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.806
- Dr. Ogden, his blood is black.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.675
-<i> The vessels of his brains,</i>
<i> lungs and liver</i>

10:43.744 --> 10:45.543
<i>are all filled with black blood.</i>

10:45.545 --> 10:47.712
- Poisoned.
- Precisely.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.281
- What kind of poison turns
blood black?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.616
Something organic?
- An alkaloid, perhaps.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.886
- Was it ingested?
- Most unlikely. The dosage

10:54.955 --> 10:57.055
required to kill someone would
need to be massive.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.558
- Injected, then.
- It's much more likely.
Far more efficient.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.161
- Then there would have
to be an injection site.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.562
- I was hoping to have found it
before you arrived.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.565
- Ah. I can wait.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.769
Have you had a chance
to visit with your sister?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.838
- Yes.
- Hmm.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.441
I received
some arresting news from her.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.310
- Regarding?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.846
- Your conviction of character.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.248
- Ah.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.585
Puns, the feeblest
form of humour.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.453
- Is it true then?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.456
Your arrest?

11:31.525 --> 11:35.192
- One hot summer evening,
when I was home from university,

11:35.228 --> 11:38.329
my colleagues and I enjoyed
swimming off Hanlon's Point...

11:38.365 --> 11:40.198
sans clothing.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.500
- Most risqué.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.335
- I don't know which was worse:

11:44.471 --> 11:46.538
being arrested
or having your parents find out.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.740
I found it.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.809
- I'm sorry?

11:50.811 --> 11:52.610
- I found it, the puncture mark.

11:52.679 --> 11:56.147
Come see. It goes
straight through the sclera

11:56.149 --> 11:58.950
and into the anterior orbit.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.022
- There it is.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.024
- William...

12:06.159 --> 12:08.293
this is from chapter two.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.628
The killer appears to be
going through the book,

12:10.697 --> 12:12.797
one case at a time.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.306
- Oh, Henry?

12:22.342 --> 12:25.042
Find out all you can
about Dr. Morley:

12:25.078 --> 12:27.044
any enemies, debts,
that sort of thing.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.447
- Sir.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.317
- So, we have a sequential
killer on the loose.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.320
You think he's working through
it one chapter at a time?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.055
- That would appear
to be the case.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.924
- How many chapters
in your book?
- 28.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.927
- Oh, crikey.
What's chapter three?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.462
- The Lipstick Murders.
- The woman who kissed

12:45.499 --> 12:47.865
her victims to death?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.801
- I suppose I should
pull out the case files.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.470
- Murdoch, before you go...

12:54.341 --> 12:56.941
Slorach has asked me
to give the farewell speech,

12:57.076 --> 12:58.810
but I'm having a bit of trouble.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.778
- Sir, I'm not the most

13:00.814 --> 13:03.214
entertaining writer,
as I've come to discover.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.150
- Bugger the writing,
I can't think of anything good

13:05.285 --> 13:08.353
to say about his career!
- He's not a very good
policeman.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.889
- He only made detective
because he solved

13:11.024 --> 13:13.291
the case of the Jarvish
strangler back in '91.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.193
- Speak about that.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.629
- What's to speak about?

13:17.631 --> 13:20.431
As I recall,
a witness told him everything.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.434
- He's a very upbeat fellow?

13:23.570 --> 13:25.670
(sighing)

13:27.907 --> 13:31.175
♪♪♪

13:31.244 --> 13:33.745
- Oh! Mr. Kellogg, honestly,

13:33.747 --> 13:35.913
you tell
the most fantastic stories.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.048
Really, you are
truly magnificent!

13:38.084 --> 13:40.784
(laughing)
- Ruthie!

13:40.821 --> 13:43.855
- Henry! What are you
doing here?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.756
- I'm looking into a doctor
who used to work here. I thought

13:45.826 --> 13:47.659
I'd come say hello
to my favourite wife.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.727
- Oh! Well, your timing couldn't
be better. Try this.

13:49.796 --> 13:53.931
- What are they?
- We're conducting
an experiment.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.334
- Mr. Kellogg is hoping
to market these...

13:56.469 --> 13:59.136
What did you call them again?
- Granose flakes.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.006
- Ugh. Sounds like a disease.
What are they made of?

14:02.075 --> 14:05.009
- Toasted corn mash.
- We'll call them that.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.612
Without the mash part.
- Corn flakes.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.414
I like it.
- Eat!

14:09.549 --> 14:11.349
Eat, eat, eat.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.088
- It's rather dry.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.190
- Exactly.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.698
Now try.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.904
- It's rather good.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.239
- Suggest serving it with milk.
It's a one-two punch

14:35.275 --> 14:37.041
of yumminess.
- It is better that way,

14:37.176 --> 14:40.577
I agree.
- Help! She's stopped breathing!

14:40.614 --> 14:42.847
- Oh!
- We need a doctor!

14:46.853 --> 14:48.686
- Oh!

14:51.625 --> 14:53.458
Oh...

14:53.460 --> 14:55.460
(crunching)

14:58.798 --> 15:00.698
- The case
of the Lipstick Murders

15:00.833 --> 15:03.801
began with the discovery of a
young man's body in a swan boat.

15:03.803 --> 15:07.204
While the motif of the swan was
to prove a key clue,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.407
the defining aspect
of the murders

15:09.476 --> 15:13.411
was the manner
in which each victim was killed.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.150
- It's not clear
what killed him, but he died

15:19.219 --> 15:22.820
5 to 10 hours ago. A canoeist
found him floating in the lake.

15:22.889 --> 15:25.156
Oh, and William, look at this.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.025
- "Let's get acquainted

15:28.094 --> 15:30.027
for fun and results."

15:30.096 --> 15:32.530
- It's a flirtation card
to be slipped discreetly

15:32.665 --> 15:35.399
to someone you wish to meet.
- So, a woman gave him

15:35.435 --> 15:37.234
this flirtation card,

15:37.270 --> 15:40.905
arranging a meeting.
He then brought her here

15:41.040 --> 15:44.508
to this lovely spot.
- Romance ensued,

15:44.577 --> 15:47.311
judging by the lip rouge
on his face.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.314
- Love was in the air.
- More than that.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.916
I believe I'm detecting
the smell of bitter almonds.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.786
It could be cyanide.

15:54.921 --> 15:58.456
- Likely not the "fun
and results" he was expecting.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.224
- "While it was clear
the victims died

16:00.360 --> 16:03.327
"from cyanide poisoning,
the manner in which the poison

16:03.396 --> 16:05.529
was administered proved
to be a puzzle."

16:05.598 --> 16:07.932
- Yes, we discovered
that the poison

16:08.067 --> 16:09.934
was delivered
by way of lip rouge.

16:10.069 --> 16:13.271
- But your book specifies
that the poison came

16:13.406 --> 16:16.808
from a cut on the lip. I don't
see a point of entry here.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.876
- That's true. In this case,
it must have been administered

16:18.945 --> 16:21.412
some other way.
- Injected?

16:21.448 --> 16:23.348
- Or ingested.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.816
- That would slow the effects

16:25.852 --> 16:28.019
long enough to see her
to hospital.

16:28.088 --> 16:31.055
- And obscure the timing
of the murder.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.858
- Is that what he's doing, then?
Copying crimes in your book

16:33.860 --> 16:35.693
but leaving out the parts
that would get him caught?

16:35.762 --> 16:38.496
- I don't know, sir,
but we now have three murders.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.299
Our best hope is to find
any possible connection

16:41.301 --> 16:43.234
between each of the victims.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.803
- We've had a few sequential
murderers. What's been

16:45.805 --> 16:48.039
the connections there?
- Well, the point of connection

16:48.174 --> 16:50.174
is usually related
to the motive.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.111
(camera clicking)

16:53.113 --> 16:54.979
-<i> In the electroplating murders,</i>

16:54.981 --> 16:57.582
<i> it was the betrayal</i>
<i> of a mutual friend.</i>

16:59.619 --> 17:01.519
- But with the lipstick killer,
it was the man

17:01.588 --> 17:04.455
who had humiliated her.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.060
-<i> You needn't be afraid</i>

17:09.195 --> 17:10.928
of this rouge stick.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.731
I chose the colour
especially for you.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.933
- And with the elder murders
from last year,

17:15.935 --> 17:17.668
the point of connection
was a red herring

17:17.804 --> 17:19.736
to obscure the true motive.

17:19.773 --> 17:23.141
-<i> Men over 60 should be</i>
<i> euthanized with chloroform.</i>

17:23.276 --> 17:25.409
- Perhaps Dr. Osler
didn't realize

17:25.478 --> 17:28.412
the influence
his words would have.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.482
- Right now, the only connection
that we know of is your book.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.751
Am I right?
- Sir?

17:33.820 --> 17:35.953
Dr. Morley had
a reputation as a drinker.

17:35.989 --> 17:38.356
He was also the defendant
in several malpractice lawsuits.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.624
- Interesting.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.894
Henry, find out
if anyone involved

17:43.029 --> 17:45.229
in those lawsuits was connected
to any of the victims.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.231
Oh, and while you're at it,

17:47.300 --> 17:49.067
gather all of the information
that you can on each

17:49.202 --> 17:51.235
of the victims:
where they were born,

17:51.370 --> 17:53.504
where they lived,
where they went to school, jobs,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.840
any friends they may have had.
We're looking for anything

17:55.842 --> 17:58.442
that connects one to the other.
- All right.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.845
Oh, and...

18:00.847 --> 18:02.747
this just came out.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.251
- Well, at least we have a
couple of suspects with motive.

18:07.386 --> 18:09.120
- Who is that?

18:09.255 --> 18:12.256
- You and you.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.725
(tense music)

18:20.566 --> 18:22.466
- Yes, yes.
This is Constable Higgins.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.769
(indistinct speaking)

18:34.414 --> 18:38.015
All right...
(sighing)

18:38.017 --> 18:40.284
- Anything popping up?

18:40.286 --> 18:44.489
- We've found some connections.
- Yes, sir.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.891
Amelia Brown and Dr. Morley
both lived on Wright Avenue,

18:46.960 --> 18:50.294
but at different times. Rebecca
Collins was once neighbours

18:50.296 --> 18:52.964
with Eve Wilson, who was
a patient of Dr. Morley's.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.299
Also, sir,
Miss Brown and Mrs. Collins

18:55.301 --> 18:57.368
both appeared
to enjoy romance fiction.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.303
- "Romance fiction"?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.338
Bloody tenuous, if you ask me.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.740
- I'd have to agree.
Any connection between

19:03.776 --> 19:05.977
two victims is
likely happenstance,

19:05.979 --> 19:08.912
but when a connection between
all three victims is found,

19:08.948 --> 19:11.115
we need to pay strict attention.
- Right then.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.116
It's time
for Slorach's send off.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.320
- Oh, I can't go.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.289
- These sequential murders are
a bloody nightmare, Murdoch.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.390
Get your head out of it for
a while, then come back to it.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.727
- Like a jigsaw puzzle.
- Sort of.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.563
Come on, Murdoch.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.835
- I'll just stay here then.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.175
(indistinct conversation)

19:40.647 --> 19:42.680
- They're crowded
into the alley.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.283
It's quite the turnout.
- Well, he was never

19:45.285 --> 19:47.818
much of a cop,
but an easy man to like.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.555
- No luck in the case
but book sales are good, I see.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.758
- Mr. Fellows.
I didn't realize you--

19:53.760 --> 19:55.493
- That I used to be a cop?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.628
Of course not. I am

19:57.664 --> 19:59.564
just a hotel detective,
after all.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.833
- I don't remember you.
- I had to leave the force.

20:02.969 --> 20:06.370
Injury in the line of duty.
Some pay the price.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.707
- So, you worked
with Inspector Slorach?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.975
- My, you are the sleuth!

20:12.011 --> 20:13.911
How did you figure that out?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.580
Oh, right. I'm here.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.216
- Ralphie boy! How's the knee?

20:19.351 --> 20:21.185
- Well, it's had
30 years to heal.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.186
- Great, great, great.
Get yourself a beer.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.656
First round's on me.
- I already have my first beer.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.292
- Great, I just saved 10 cents.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.463
Oh, Tommy, I'm looking forward
to your speech.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.332
Give me your worst. No one will
be laughing harder than me.

20:35.368 --> 20:38.002
- We'll see about that.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.405
Ahem. If I could have
your attention, please.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.607
(phone ringing)
I'd like to say a few words

20:43.610 --> 20:45.743
about everyone's
favourite inspector.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.811
Or, as we used to call him,

20:47.880 --> 20:49.947
Sloppy Seconds Slorach!

20:50.082 --> 20:51.948
- That's true! That's true,
they did! They did!

20:51.985 --> 20:55.286
- Sorry to interrupt,
but there's a telephone call

20:55.421 --> 20:57.287
for the man of the hour.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.624
- That would be me.
(chuckling)

20:59.759 --> 21:01.558
- Right. Quiet down, lads.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.361
Let the man of the hour
hear the bloody phone.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.264
- Hello? Who is this?

21:08.234 --> 21:11.168
Can you hear me now?

21:11.237 --> 21:12.970
(grunting)

21:13.105 --> 21:15.539
- NO!
- What happened?!

21:15.575 --> 21:17.775
(heavy breathing)

21:23.583 --> 21:26.117
- Angels. I see angels.
Angels are carrying me.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.519
- Oof.
- I'm floating away.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.521
ANGELS!

21:30.523 --> 21:32.590
- Learn anything, sir?

21:32.592 --> 21:34.625
- Bloody useless, the lot of
them. You'd think in a bar room

21:34.627 --> 21:36.527
full of coppers, someone would
have seen something.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.395
- We didn't see anything either.

21:38.431 --> 21:41.332
- So, what would make
an earpiece explode like that?

21:41.401 --> 21:44.068
- I believe it was struck

21:44.137 --> 21:47.004
by a high velocity projectile.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.272
- You mean a bullet?
I didn't hear a shot.

21:49.309 --> 21:53.077
- Well... not exactly
a bullet, sir.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.414
I believe this crime
was inspired

21:56.549 --> 21:59.916
by chapter four of the book.
- What's chapter four?

21:59.952 --> 22:02.520
-<i> "Murder at the Hall</i>
<i> of Inventions."</i>

22:04.157 --> 22:06.424
<i> As you might remember,</i>

22:06.426 --> 22:09.092
<i> I had been called</i>
<i>to the convention to investigate</i>

22:09.128 --> 22:11.962
<i> a threat to an inventor.</i>
- That's me.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.031
- Mr. Schreyer,
under the circumstances,

22:14.166 --> 22:16.433
I would advise you
not to go up on that stage.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.969
- No. I have worked for years
for this moment.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.239
I'm not going to be intimidated.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.208
-<i> Mr. Schreyer accepted</i>
<i> his award...</i>

22:26.179 --> 22:30.748
(gasping and screaming)
<i> ...and paid the price</i>
<i> with his life.</i>

22:30.883 --> 22:34.651
Seal the exits, George.
This man's been murdered.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.521
- There was no gunshot.
- None that was heard, sir.

22:37.557 --> 22:40.858
Obviously, something penetrated
his skull. As to how...

22:40.860 --> 22:43.460
- Must have been someone
who used one of those mufflers

22:43.596 --> 22:45.929
that silences a gunshot.
- How could someone have used

22:45.965 --> 22:48.199
such a weapon
without being seen?

22:48.201 --> 22:53.137
A bit higher, Constable. Higher.
<i> We determined the trajectory</i>

22:53.139 --> 22:55.372
<i> of the bullet.</i>
There.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.875
Oh, that's odd.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.880
- You found it led to a killing
machine. Where would that be?

23:03.015 --> 23:05.482
- Well, let's see.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.751
Inspector Slorach was
standing here, facing this way.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.487
So, the shot had
to have come from...

23:10.623 --> 23:13.157
- Well, well, well.
Your book has certainly

23:13.226 --> 23:15.425
turned out to be
quite inspirational.

23:15.461 --> 23:18.495
- How do you know
that's what this is?
- I am a detective.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.231
I may not write books,
but I am capable

23:21.300 --> 23:24.234
of abductive reasoning.
- You're also connected

23:24.303 --> 23:26.970
to the first murder,
and this latest attempt.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.106
- Oh, am I a suspect now?

23:29.241 --> 23:32.777
- How do you explain
the coincidence?
- How do you?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.778
Yes, I'm connected to two,

23:34.847 --> 23:36.680
but you're connected
to all of them.

23:36.682 --> 23:40.184
Furthermore, you have a motive.
Your books are just flying

23:40.186 --> 23:43.187
off the shelves. Nothing like
a little murder to goose sales.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.656
- I'll goose you if you don't
shut up and let him work.

23:45.658 --> 23:48.058
- Oh, yes. Of course.
Let the master detective

23:48.194 --> 23:51.862
ply his trade.
He's written a book, you know!

23:51.898 --> 23:53.797
Ho ho ho!

23:53.833 --> 23:55.466
- Bloody pain in the backside
he is.

23:55.601 --> 23:58.401
- All right then.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.337
(suspenseful music)

24:03.075 --> 24:05.141
Excuse me.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.711
What's behind here?
- A storage room.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.324
(creaking)

24:23.162 --> 24:25.129
- Well, we've seen this before,
haven't we?

24:27.266 --> 24:29.233
- What is it?

24:29.302 --> 24:31.902
- I have no idea.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.904
This is a battery.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.973
There are wires leading to a...

24:36.108 --> 24:38.242
switch of some sort...

24:38.244 --> 24:41.879
but then, this appears
to be a switch as well.

24:47.453 --> 24:50.186
I'm going to bypass
these switches

24:50.223 --> 24:52.389
to see...

24:52.425 --> 24:55.058
if I can figure out what the...

24:55.094 --> 24:57.328
(whirring and clicking)

25:01.067 --> 25:03.366
(firing sound)

25:03.402 --> 25:05.201
I believe we've found

25:05.238 --> 25:07.471
our murder weapon, George.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.874
There are some similarities.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.276
But it can't be the same.
- Why is that?

25:12.411 --> 25:15.212
- Because Karl Schreyer
shot himself.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.814
He put himself in the position
and triggered the device.

25:17.884 --> 25:21.619
In this case,
the killer had to...

25:21.621 --> 25:24.622
control the timing
as well as the position.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.357
- So, the killer was among us.
- Not exactly.

25:27.426 --> 25:31.494
This device was triggered
by this alarm clock.

25:31.531 --> 25:34.565
It's set for 8PM. So, no one
in the room could have

25:34.634 --> 25:36.666
affected the timing.
As for the position,

25:36.702 --> 25:38.768
the killer had him speak
into the telephone

25:38.804 --> 25:41.972
at precisely 8PM. Henry!

25:41.974 --> 25:43.974
- So, whoever telephoned
tried to kill him.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.776
- That would appear
to be the case.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.644
- Sir?
- Any success?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.446
- The switchboard operator
remembers the call. She said

25:49.515 --> 25:52.449
the voice sounded
like it was put on.
- He likely disguised it.

25:52.518 --> 25:54.585
- Did she remember
where the call came from?

25:54.720 --> 25:56.653
- Yes, sir. It came
from the Windsor House Hotel.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.723
- Ralph Fellows works
at the Windsor House Hotel.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.725
- Yes, but Ralph Fellows was

26:01.727 --> 26:03.661
at the retirement party. He
couldn't have placed the call.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.396
- He wasn't one of the coppers

26:05.531 --> 26:07.398
that I talked to directly
after Slorach was shot.

26:07.533 --> 26:10.667
- The Windsor House Hotel

26:10.803 --> 26:12.469
is what,
three blocks from there?

26:12.605 --> 26:14.405
Could he have run
to the Windsor House,

26:14.540 --> 26:16.340
placed the call and run back?

26:16.409 --> 26:18.876
- He did seem a bit winded.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.211
- As far as I know, Mr. Fellows
was here all evening.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.080
- He wasn't.

26:23.149 --> 26:26.683
He was at a retirement party for
at least part of the evening.

26:26.719 --> 26:30.754
- I didn't give him
permission to leave.
- Regardless, I need to know

26:30.790 --> 26:34.290
where he was at precisely 8PM.
- Some time ago,

26:34.327 --> 26:37.494
I caught Mr. Fellows
sleeping on the job,

26:37.496 --> 26:39.229
so I had one of these installed.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.699
He's required
to punch in on the hour,

26:42.768 --> 26:45.102
every hour.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.405
- "8:01."

26:51.510 --> 26:54.912
- Is Fellows our man, then?
- He is a strong suspect.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.781
What could his motive be?

26:57.916 --> 26:59.850
- Taking you down a peg or two.

26:59.985 --> 27:02.919
Well, he's always
resented your success.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.055
And you're Toronto's
most famous detective.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.190
And now... you're infamous

27:07.226 --> 27:09.192
for writing
a how-to book for murder.

27:09.261 --> 27:12.062
- Not even Ralph Fellows is
that spiteful.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.331
But if he did have motive

27:14.466 --> 27:16.266
to kill these specific victims,

27:16.268 --> 27:18.002
then I suppose taking us down

27:18.137 --> 27:20.870
a peg could be a welcome bonus.
- Sir.

27:20.906 --> 27:23.407
Ralph Fellows once worked
for Miss Brown's father.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.208
- The Pinkerton fellow?

27:25.244 --> 27:27.811
- Bring in Mr. Brown, Henry.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.880
- Sir.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.086
- Yeah, I hired Ralph.
He lasted exactly one week.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.956
- What happened?
- I came back from lunch

27:38.958 --> 27:42.025
and found my Amelia shooting
bottles in the alley
with his pistol.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.261
- He gave her his pistol?!
- Well, no, he didn't give it

27:45.297 --> 27:47.564
to her, but he left it in a
place where she could find it.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.100
Worst of all, he wouldn't admit
it! Claimed he kept it

27:50.136 --> 27:54.271
locked up. I fired him on the
spot. Haven't seen him since.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.508
What, you think
he murdered my Amelia

27:58.544 --> 28:00.243
because she got him fired?

28:00.312 --> 28:03.046
- It did seem a bit much.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.849
- I don't disagree, but we have
a connection and motive.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.652
Let's see what the constables
have found. Henry.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.654
What have you?
- Well, the hotel owner gave us

28:10.789 --> 28:13.190
the access to Mr. Fellows' room.
We found this.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.225
- "Learn German."
- It suggests he may be

28:15.261 --> 28:17.660
intending to flee.
- Hmm. Anything else?

28:17.697 --> 28:20.664
- Yes, we found some of his old
correspondence. Tells somewhat

28:20.799 --> 28:22.933
of a sad story, I'm afraid.
- Go on.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.935
- Well, in 1865, Ralph Fellows

28:25.004 --> 28:27.004
applied to be a detective
at Scotland Yard.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.806
He was accepted.
- Ralph Fellows for
England's finest?!

28:29.842 --> 28:31.742
- Mm-hmm.
- Why didn't he go?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.877
- The woman he was courting
hid the acceptance letter.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.013
- How did you learn that?
- Well, she wrote

28:36.015 --> 28:38.081
a subsequent letter admitting
what she did, sir.

28:38.150 --> 28:41.151
She blamed bad advice
from a friend for her treachery.

28:41.187 --> 28:45.089
- What was the friend's name?
- Becky Winters.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.324
- "Becky".

28:49.061 --> 28:52.629
Becky is short for Rebecca.
Henry, telephone City Records

28:52.631 --> 28:55.165
and see if Rebecca Collins'
maiden name is Winters.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.034
- You're thinking she might be
victim number three.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.704
- If Mr. Fellows is our killer,
he certainly would have

29:00.773 --> 29:02.706
had motive.
- Sir.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.309
I just found this.
- What is it, Murdoch?

29:05.444 --> 29:08.779
- A letter
from Mr. Fellows' lawyer.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.882
He was suing Dr. Morley.

29:16.054 --> 29:17.987
- Sir, Rebecca Winters

29:18.023 --> 29:20.257
married Rupert Collins in 1881.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.527
- What about Slorach?
What's the motive there?

29:23.596 --> 29:26.930
- Ralph Fellows aspired
to become a detective.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.465
He never made it. Slorach did.

29:29.502 --> 29:31.935
- So, Slorach reaches the
pinnacle of his profession,

29:31.971 --> 29:33.737
while Ralph Fellows ends up

29:33.806 --> 29:35.606
a hotel detective.
That's gotta rankle.

29:35.741 --> 29:38.475
- Ralph Fellows had motive
to kill all four victims.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.877
- Bring him in, Higgins.
Three counts murder,

29:40.913 --> 29:42.780
one attempted.
- Sir.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.557
- Planning on leaving town?

29:53.559 --> 29:56.293
- I suppose the notion
of self-improvement

29:56.362 --> 29:59.129
must be inconceivable to someone

29:59.131 --> 30:00.964
who considers themselves
to be perfect.

30:01.099 --> 30:05.302
But you're not perfect.
You have arrested the only man

30:05.371 --> 30:08.105
that I know could not have
committed these murders.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.506
- How is that?
(scoffing)

30:10.543 --> 30:12.442
- I'm pretty sure
I would've known

30:12.478 --> 30:14.845
if I was going around
killing people I don't know.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.747
- Oh, but you do know them.

30:16.749 --> 30:19.716
- I know Slorach.
I have no reason to kill him.

30:19.718 --> 30:22.319
- Detective Slorach was promoted

30:22.321 --> 30:24.988
ahead of you. Undeservedly.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.391
But you wanted that job.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.993
You may have eventually

30:29.995 --> 30:33.062
made detective,
but a botched surgery

30:33.098 --> 30:36.065
rendered you unfit for service.

30:36.101 --> 30:38.402
A surgery performed

30:38.537 --> 30:41.471
by Dr. Morley.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.541
You, of course,
remember Robert Brown.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.610
You worked with him
at the Pinkerton's.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.212
The body of the woman
that was found

30:49.215 --> 30:51.614
in the lobby was his daughter.

30:51.650 --> 30:54.417
- No...

30:54.486 --> 30:57.020
- I believe
she found your pistol--

30:57.022 --> 30:58.821
- Yes, I know what happened!

30:58.858 --> 31:01.224
- Likewise, you also remember

31:01.293 --> 31:03.092
Rebecca Collins.

31:03.128 --> 31:06.864
- Who is she?
- Her maiden name was Winters.

31:09.134 --> 31:12.603
- Dear God. That was Becky?

31:15.774 --> 31:18.175
- Each of the victims
harmed you in a way

31:18.177 --> 31:20.177
that forever denied
your ambition

31:20.312 --> 31:22.979
to become a detective.

31:23.015 --> 31:26.850
- That was my ambition.
I admit that.

31:28.921 --> 31:31.321
As a child,
I used to play detective.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.625
I uncovered
all my sister's crimes...

31:37.195 --> 31:39.596
...but I did not
place that call.

31:39.598 --> 31:43.133
Nor did I kill the doctor
who destroyed my career,

31:43.202 --> 31:46.336
or that loathsome child
who decided to play pop gun

31:46.372 --> 31:50.006
with my pistol outside my boss's
window, and I most certainly

31:50.042 --> 31:52.542
did not kill Becky Winters

31:52.544 --> 31:54.945
with a lipstick kiss of death.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.414
- Then who did?

31:57.549 --> 32:00.283
Who else knows

32:00.319 --> 32:02.819
of all of these connections?

32:02.888 --> 32:05.488
- No doubt that you think
that there's a lineup of people

32:05.524 --> 32:08.492
around the block who wish
to set me up for murder.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.761
Nobody hates me that much.

32:10.896 --> 32:14.097
- Then how do you explain
the connections, Mr. Fellows?

32:17.502 --> 32:19.436
- I used to be lucky.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.571
As a child, I was blessed.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.707
Everything went my way.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.508
My father was a pathetic drunk.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.577
He was gone by the time I was 7.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.912
My sister got lumped with him.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.248
I got to live with my mother

32:32.250 --> 32:33.951
in Canada.

32:34.086 --> 32:37.587
I was always her favourite.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.056
And her new husband just
happened to have

32:40.125 --> 32:42.259
a brother who worked
in Scotland Yard.

32:42.261 --> 32:45.062
- So, when you came of age
you applied,

32:45.197 --> 32:47.197
knowing you would be accepted.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.966
But you never heard back
from them.

32:50.002 --> 32:53.870
Because Miss Winters hid
your letter of acceptance.

32:53.872 --> 32:57.941
- Her friend convinced her
that she would lose me.

32:57.943 --> 33:00.343
The irony is,

33:00.379 --> 33:03.346
I would have married Becky
and taken her with me.

33:03.382 --> 33:06.850
That's the day...
my luck turned.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.154
You're a Catholic.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.424
You must believe in God's hand.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.360
Surely you must have
felt it on your back

33:16.495 --> 33:18.761
when you got your perfect job,
your perfect wife,

33:18.797 --> 33:21.298
your best-selling book.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.167
- I believe in His grace.

33:24.169 --> 33:27.837
- Then surely, you must allow
for the opposite...

33:27.906 --> 33:30.107
denial of grace.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.509
Malevolent fortune.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.811
At every juncture,

33:34.946 --> 33:37.980
the fates conspired
against my ambitions,

33:38.017 --> 33:40.217
my... happiness.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.987
You want my explanation?

33:45.024 --> 33:48.392
Here it is:
there is a killer out there

33:48.527 --> 33:52.395
using your book
to kill people randomly.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.398
It's just my bad luck

33:54.533 --> 33:56.399
they all happen to be people

33:56.402 --> 33:58.535
who I have motive to kill.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.338
Or do you consider me
stupid enough

34:01.473 --> 34:03.873
to leave a correspondence trail

34:03.942 --> 34:06.610
that links me to every victim?

34:08.480 --> 34:13.016
Just my luck.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.288
- It's got to be him.

34:18.423 --> 34:20.223
Who else would have the motive
to kill these people?

34:20.225 --> 34:22.325
- I don't know, sir.

34:22.394 --> 34:25.028
But I take his point:
would he have left

34:25.030 --> 34:27.830
such a trail of evidence?
Is he that stupid?

34:27.866 --> 34:30.700
And if so, how did he
conceive of, let alone execute,

34:30.736 --> 34:33.836
all of these crimes?
- If it is a setup,

34:33.872 --> 34:35.906
is the real killer out
to get Fellows, or do they

34:36.041 --> 34:37.841
have the wrong motive?
- Well, we know

34:37.843 --> 34:40.243
that the killer telephoned
from the Windsor House Hotel.

34:40.378 --> 34:42.112
- What about the hotel owner?
- She was the one who bought

34:42.181 --> 34:45.715
the machine that ensured Fellows
would be there on the hour.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.118
- She's also the one
who invited the constables

34:48.187 --> 34:50.587
to search his room.
- Sir.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.857
Becky Collins' friend,
the one who advised her to hide

34:53.926 --> 34:56.526
Mr. Fellows' acceptance letter,
her name was Eve.

34:56.562 --> 34:59.362
- "Eve"?
- It could be short for Evelyn.

35:02.868 --> 35:06.068
- You're thinking she acted
to sabotage his career?

35:06.105 --> 35:08.138
- I don't know.

35:08.273 --> 35:11.074
But if she was
behind his first failure,

35:11.209 --> 35:13.009
it stands to reason

35:13.145 --> 35:15.712
that she had a hand
in the rest of them.

35:21.386 --> 35:24.421
(giggling)
- Pookie!

35:24.423 --> 35:26.890
Mr. Kellogg. Ahem.
- Mr. Kellogg is forming

35:26.959 --> 35:28.859
the Battle Creek
Toasted Cornflake Company.

35:28.994 --> 35:32.828
- We've come to see
if you are free for dinner.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.698
- I can't. We're in
the middle of a case.

35:34.700 --> 35:37.567
- Oh. Pity. Well, I suppose
we'll have to celebrate

35:37.636 --> 35:39.902
our partnership without you.
- I'll meet you

35:39.938 --> 35:41.838
at the restaurant, Mr. Kellogg.
- Very good.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.841
I'll see you shortly...
(snapping his fingers)

35:44.976 --> 35:47.043
A rooster on the box.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.712
- Brilliant!

35:49.748 --> 35:52.582
Do I look like a rooster?
- "Partnership"?

35:52.618 --> 35:55.851
- Oh, not an equal partnership,
but he's given us 1000 shares.

35:55.888 --> 35:58.388
- Really? How much
are they worth?

35:58.390 --> 36:00.389
- $100, but think about

36:00.425 --> 36:02.392
how much more they'll be worth
in 10 years' time.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.361
- Pumpkin...

36:04.496 --> 36:06.463
I really don't see people eating

36:06.465 --> 36:08.665
dried flakes,
especially not at breakfast.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.633
- Are you sure, Henny?

36:10.669 --> 36:12.002
- Sure as sunshine, Ruthie.

36:12.137 --> 36:14.070
- Oh.
- I'll tell you what.

36:14.139 --> 36:17.474
Sell the shares. We'll buy
that new chesterfield that
you were looking at.

36:17.609 --> 36:21.077
- Oh, I did very much like
that chesterfield.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.213
- SIR!

36:23.282 --> 36:25.581
Evelyn Matthews' maiden name
was Wilson,

36:25.617 --> 36:28.217
and an Eve Wilson was
a Pinkerton's client in 1886.

36:28.253 --> 36:30.152
- When Amelia Brown was 5.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.155
- Do you think she tricked
the little girl into stealing

36:32.224 --> 36:34.890
Fellows' pistol?
- Sir, did I hear you say

36:34.927 --> 36:36.893
Eve Wilson?
- Yes, what have you?

36:36.962 --> 36:38.762
- Eve Wilson was
a patient of Dr. Morley.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.297
- Perhaps she got him drinking

36:41.433 --> 36:43.833
before he operated
on Mr. Fellows?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.902
- Where's the connection
to Slorach?

36:45.971 --> 36:47.770
Did she arrange for him to solve
the Jarvish strangler case?

36:47.806 --> 36:50.774
- It's more likely
that she impeded

36:50.909 --> 36:53.175
Ralph Fellows'
own investigation of it.

36:53.212 --> 36:56.112
- Why would she dedicate herself
to ruining Mr. Fellows' life?

36:56.114 --> 36:57.581
- Henry.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.883
I need you
to telegraph Scotland Yard.

37:01.987 --> 37:04.587
Your maiden name was Wilson

37:04.656 --> 37:06.790
and you went by the name of Eve.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.791
- I'm still called Eve
by my friends.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.927
- You were friends

37:10.996 --> 37:13.929
with Rebecca Winters
in the late '60s.

37:13.966 --> 37:16.532
- For a short time.
- You advised her

37:16.568 --> 37:20.170
to hide Mr. Fellows' letter of
acceptance from Scotland Yard.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.539
Your hired the Pinkterton
Detective Agency

37:23.575 --> 37:27.410
while Mr. Fellows worked there.
- If you say so.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.178
- And you were a patient

37:29.214 --> 37:31.080
of Dr. Morley's.

37:31.149 --> 37:34.217
You are connected
to every victim in this case.

37:34.219 --> 37:37.721
- It doesn't mean I had reason
to kill any of them.
- I believe you did.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.623
I believe
you deliberately set out

37:39.758 --> 37:41.558
to destroy Mr. Fellows' life,

37:41.693 --> 37:44.160
and for the coup de grace,
you set him up for murder.

37:44.229 --> 37:46.629
And were prepared to watch him
hang for it.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.499
- Why would I do that?
I barely knew him.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.302
- Your birth name was

37:53.338 --> 37:57.040
Catharine Evelyn Fellows.
Ralph Fellows' sister.

37:57.109 --> 38:01.177
You resented him.
- Is that what he told you?

38:01.313 --> 38:06.616
- He had good fortune,
and you did not.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.520
- Fortune had
nothing to do with it.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.723
He got everything
he wanted because he
was a little bootlicker.

38:13.759 --> 38:17.127
And as for me,
every time I stepped out

38:17.262 --> 38:19.596
of line, he was there
with his magnifying glass

38:19.731 --> 38:23.066
and abductive reasoning
to find me out and turn me in.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.134
And it wasn't just me.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.937
It was Ralph who uncovered
our father's adultery

38:27.973 --> 38:30.606
and ended their marriage.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.742
Everything bad that happened
he made happen!

38:32.877 --> 38:34.878
It's his fault! All of it!

38:35.013 --> 38:38.181
- So, you admit it?
- Oh, I admit I dedicated myself

38:38.183 --> 38:41.284
to squelching his ambition,
and I don't regret it.

38:41.419 --> 38:44.420
He would have made
a terrible detective.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.022
The truth was staring him
in the face the whole time.

38:47.059 --> 38:50.025
I even hired him just to make
his life miserable

38:50.062 --> 38:52.462
and he never put it together.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.902
- That his own sister was
the architect of his misfortune.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.105
- He thought it was
all his bad luck.

39:02.174 --> 39:04.040
What an idiot.

39:04.109 --> 39:06.709
So, go ahead.

39:06.745 --> 39:10.180
Charge me. All the evidence
points to him.

39:10.182 --> 39:13.049
Any jury will see that.

39:13.118 --> 39:16.586
- Evelyn was Catharine?

39:18.456 --> 39:21.056
- She set out to destroy you,
Mr. Fellows.

39:21.093 --> 39:23.660
- But...

39:23.795 --> 39:25.662
I always liked Catharine.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.664
I'd always hoped
the best for her.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.301
Will she hang?

39:33.138 --> 39:35.205
- If she confesses, no.

39:35.340 --> 39:37.407
But she refuses.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.542
I'm sorry.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.878
- Don't be.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.614
You gave me back my life.

39:47.119 --> 39:49.285
I always thought God hated me.

39:49.321 --> 39:51.621
Turns out it was just her.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.631
(dramatic music)

40:01.633 --> 40:04.167
- (Ralph Fellows):<i> As a child,</i>
<i> I used to play detective.</i>

40:04.302 --> 40:06.236
<i> I uncovered</i>

40:06.371 --> 40:08.872
<i> all my sister's crimes.</i>

40:10.909 --> 40:12.642
- Why did he tell me that?

40:12.777 --> 40:16.112
<i> If he'd never told me</i>
<i> about his sister,</i>

40:16.181 --> 40:18.314
I never would have
put it together.

40:18.383 --> 40:20.316
- So, you think
Mr. Fellows discovered

40:20.385 --> 40:22.585
Evelyn Matthews was his sister?

40:22.621 --> 40:24.854
- Once he'd figured out
what she'd done,

40:24.856 --> 40:27.523
he set her up
by setting himself up.

40:27.559 --> 40:30.593
- Gambling that you would figure
that much out but no more?

40:30.662 --> 40:32.395
- If you look at the bulk

40:32.530 --> 40:35.732
of our cases, the first suspect
is rarely the culprit.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.601
- But to conceive
of such a revenge,

40:38.736 --> 40:40.737
let alone carry it out,
would take a genius.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.339
Does Ralph Fellows
really strike you

40:43.375 --> 40:45.942
as a genius?
-<i> I'm saying</i>

40:46.077 --> 40:47.944
it's a bad idea.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.746
- The banquet or the fact
that it's being held

40:49.881 --> 40:52.281
in complete darkness?
- Well, obviously I'm not

40:52.350 --> 40:54.484
against banquets,
I do work in a hotel.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.088
- This dinner is in honour
of a very special guest

40:59.157 --> 41:01.958
who is both blind and deaf,
which is why we've invited

41:02.027 --> 41:04.961
blind and deaf guests
as well as charitable donors.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.830
- Exactly.
Mixing the rich with the poor?

41:06.965 --> 41:08.698
With the lights out?!

41:08.767 --> 41:10.733
And a constituency

41:10.735 --> 41:13.236
specially skilled
for such circumstance.

41:13.371 --> 41:16.306
The opportunity
for theft is obvious.

41:16.308 --> 41:19.575
As a fellow detective,

41:19.644 --> 41:21.710
you must appreciate my position.

41:21.746 --> 41:24.580
- He's not a fool, Julia.

41:24.616 --> 41:27.450
He's just desperate
to be taken seriously.

41:27.585 --> 41:30.653
- Which can make
anyone seem like a fool.

41:30.722 --> 41:34.457
He must have known we thought
him unintelligent.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.392
Maybe that's
what he was counting on.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.327
- He uses our book to set up

41:38.363 --> 41:40.730
his sister
and gets revenge on us

41:40.732 --> 41:42.665
when we have
an innocent woman hang.

41:42.734 --> 41:45.735
- But William, the one lesson
he must have taken from our book

41:45.870 --> 41:48.204
is that you always catch
the killer in the end.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.407
Would he not have
taken precautions?

41:51.476 --> 41:53.509
- We found this.
- "Learn German".

41:53.545 --> 41:55.478
- It suggests he may be
intending to flee.

41:59.818 --> 42:02.519
(suspenseful music)

42:02.654 --> 42:04.420
(engine rumbling)

42:04.456 --> 42:07.957
- Sir, Ralph Fellows bought a
ticket to Hamburg on a ship
that sailed two weeks ago.

42:07.993 --> 42:09.826
Purchased September 18.

42:09.828 --> 42:11.627
- Right before
the murders began.

42:11.763 --> 42:15.298
He planned it all out.
- And he bloody well
got away with it as well.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.101
- Henry, contact
the German authorities.

42:18.236 --> 42:20.169
- Right away, sir.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.306
- (Brackenreid): Ah, Hamish!
How are you faring?

42:23.375 --> 42:25.708
- Have I seen fairies?

42:25.843 --> 42:28.511
- How are you faring?
- Oh, good.

42:28.513 --> 42:30.713
Very good, very good. I don't
know why Tom was just asking

42:30.715 --> 42:33.316
about fairies.
- However did he make inspector?

42:33.318 --> 42:36.452
- I heard that.
- Oh, come here.

42:36.521 --> 42:39.522

43:00.145 --> 43:01.878
- Yeah!
- Detective Murd--

43:02.013 --> 43:04.080
- [You figured it out.]

43:04.215 --> 43:06.148
- Mr. Fellows.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.151
Where are you?

43:08.286 --> 43:11.087
- You win...

43:11.156 --> 43:13.088

43:13.124 --> 43:16.025

- We're heading down to
