00:14.823 --> 00:18.535
Julisa ... Julisa ...

00:24.833 --> 00:25.834
Aure ...

00:28.586 --> 00:30.130
Julisa

00:30.130 --> 00:32.006
Aurelio?

00:35.844 --> 00:36.594
Julisa

00:39.347 --> 00:43.351
Aurelio?
Estado hacienda aqui?

00:44.352 --> 00:46.938
Why didn't you come to bed?

00:53.862 --> 00:57.532
Julisa... ayude me

01:21.531 --> 01:23.575
Back it up and
set a perimeter

01:24.284 --> 01:25.827
No one within five hundred feet!

01:25.827 --> 01:28.246
Quiet calm of this Coral Gables
neighborhood

01:28.454 --> 01:29.873
was shattered early this morning by...

01:30.081 --> 01:31.499
Want a cup of coffee, H?

01:31.708 --> 01:32.834
No, thank you

01:33.835 --> 01:35.044
That smells good

01:35.044 --> 01:36.379
A little cafÃ© cubano

01:36.379 --> 01:37.922
Put some hair on your chest

01:39.799 --> 01:41.426
Don't you just say the sweetest things

01:41.426 --> 01:42.886
That stuff's no good for you

01:42.886 --> 01:44.637
It'll rot your stomach out

01:44.637 --> 01:46.222
It is believed that the bomb squad

01:46.222 --> 01:47.891
- ... is inside this house right now
- Is it serious?

01:47.891 --> 01:49.017
Change the channel

01:50.226 --> 01:51.769
It's not known if anyone else is

01:52.103 --> 01:52.770
in the house or if...

01:53.021 --> 01:54.522
Live on the scene of a bomb scare...

01:54.522 --> 01:56.149
... bomb in a Coral Gables...

01:56.149 --> 01:57.817
County Dade Bomb squad...

02:03.990 --> 02:06.284
I didn't know they made body
armor in triple extra-large

02:07.035 --> 02:08.578
They make jockey that size

02:08.578 --> 02:10.747
but you wouldn't know
anything about that either

02:11.581 --> 02:13.124
Horatio Caine

02:13.583 --> 02:15.126
Back from the dead

02:15.126 --> 02:17.295
Found any good fiber lately?

02:17.295 --> 02:18.922
Just enough to keep me regular

02:18.922 --> 02:20.048
What do we have here?

02:20.048 --> 02:21.507
Schedule-80 PVC collar

02:21.507 --> 02:23.009
clamped around the vic's neck

02:23.009 --> 02:24.928
Going to have to "John Wayne" it

02:24.928 --> 02:27.096
That's not the way you
taught us, Big Man

02:27.096 --> 02:28.514
I don't have much choice

02:28.514 --> 02:29.641
Can't do remote

02:29.641 --> 02:30.600
Got to be hands-on

02:30.600 --> 02:32.310
Best hands in the business

02:33.770 --> 02:35.813
Look, I gota go do this thing

02:35.813 --> 02:38.066
but let's grab a beer later
Catch up

02:49.702 --> 02:54.207
I-I keep my insurance policies
in a wall safe upstairs

02:54.541 --> 02:55.583
It's good to know

02:56.668 --> 02:59.254
I keep mine in a sock drawer

03:00.171 --> 03:03.716
Would you tell my wife ...

03:04.676 --> 03:06.719
tell her I love her

03:07.178 --> 03:10.014
You can tell her yourself
in a couple of minutes

03:10.014 --> 03:12.934
You two will be knocking
back mojitos in no time

04:39.252 --> 04:41.296
All right, we lost the family today
this is top priority

04:41.796 --> 04:43.632
- Where's Horatio?
- Inside

04:43.965 --> 04:46.134
Have you talked to him?
Because, uh, I think he knew the guy

04:46.134 --> 04:47.844
Yeah, Al Humphreys

04:47.844 --> 04:49.471
He brought him on to the
bomb squad, trained him

04:49.721 --> 04:50.764
They were close

04:50.764 --> 04:52.390
Give me a minute alone with him, okay?

04:52.849 --> 04:53.350
Okay

04:53.850 --> 04:54.768
Thanks

05:11.034 --> 05:14.120
Victim's name is, uh,
Aurelio Moreno

05:14.871 --> 05:18.500
He's a successful
Columbian importer

05:18.875 --> 05:22.545
This is obviously the seat of
detonation right here

05:23.880 --> 05:27.884
The shattering effect here
indicates high explosive and blast

05:27.884 --> 05:30.136
and frag pattern indicates that

05:30.387 --> 05:34.140
the explosive, uh,
was packed up front

05:34.432 --> 05:36.977
Everything above the
neck is blown away

05:37.269 --> 05:38.770
Below remains intact

05:39.980 --> 05:41.481
Horatio, this isn't a great idea ...

05:41.773 --> 05:43.650
Is everybody outside?

05:44.359 --> 05:45.360
Yeah

05:45.652 --> 05:47.904
You should stand down
let us work this one

05:48.113 --> 05:50.031
This is a crime scene like any other

05:50.031 --> 05:52.867
We should at least wait for
the M.E. to clear the bodies

05:52.867 --> 05:54.286
What I need you to do

05:54.286 --> 05:57.205
is I need to get everybody in here
right now to process this

05:57.205 --> 06:01.876
I want every hair, nail, fiber and
every ounce of Al's blood recovered

06:03.420 --> 06:06.506
There are no other crime
scenes in Miami today

06:15.724 --> 06:17.642
Three types of damage here:

06:17.642 --> 06:21.813
Frag from the container thermal
effect from the release of gasses

06:22.647 --> 06:24.190
and blast pressure

06:24.190 --> 06:26.484
Potentially the most damaging

06:27.068 --> 06:30.947
Blast pressure forces air
outward in a shock front

06:31.156 --> 06:34.784
of up to twenty-nine thousand
feet per second

06:37.746 --> 06:39.247
When did you ever
work a bomb scene?

06:40.165 --> 06:42.375
I happen to read books

06:42.751 --> 06:43.752
Okay?

06:44.002 --> 06:47.589
What does your book say ... about this?

06:49.591 --> 06:51.885
Blast pressure has two phases:

06:51.885 --> 06:53.845
positive and negative

06:54.095 --> 06:55.597
When the air is pushed outward

06:55.931 --> 06:57.432
it creates a vacuum in the center

06:57.432 --> 06:59.392
So everything gets sucked back in

07:02.270 --> 07:04.564
It also means that the
components from this device

07:04.564 --> 07:06.191
are still in this room

07:06.191 --> 07:08.318
They're  in a thousand pieces,
but we should find them

07:08.526 --> 07:09.611
So, Calleigh, let's find out

07:09.611 --> 07:11.071
who  had access to the house

07:11.071 --> 07:13.448
Eric, we've got to find
that ransom note

07:13.740 --> 07:16.326
And Speed, you Megan and
I will look for the bomb

07:16.660 --> 07:19.245
Find the bomb, find the bomber

08:07.043 --> 08:09.796
Bomber came in through
an unlocked window

08:09.796 --> 08:10.839
in the maid's room

08:10.839 --> 08:12.173
Yesterday was her regular day off

08:12.799 --> 08:14.926
Means the bomber knew their routine

08:15.135 --> 08:16.136
And Moreno's wife said

08:16.428 --> 08:18.680
he liked to stay up late and watch TV

08:18.930 --> 08:22.017
My guess is he got jumped right
in the middle of Letterman

08:22.017 --> 08:24.477
"Top ten ways to get
your head blown off."

08:26.521 --> 08:27.856
I'm sorry, lieutenant.  I didn't mean ...
it's okay

08:28.982 --> 08:31.026
I also found some type
of fabric on the frame

08:31.026 --> 08:32.568
Let's get that to trace, all right?

08:32.568 --> 08:34.111
Is  this the note?

08:34.111 --> 08:34.904
Yeah

08:34.904 --> 08:37.616
Note's got some flash burns,
minimal blood spatter

08:37.616 --> 08:38.825
certainly readable

08:38.825 --> 08:40.327
I mean, "this is a bomb

08:40.577 --> 08:41.328
deliver $50,000 ...

08:41.328 --> 08:42.537
Fifty grand?

08:42.537 --> 08:43.788
Did you see the size of that place?

08:43.788 --> 08:45.290
He could've asked for ten times that

08:45.290 --> 08:46.833
Let's get this to chemical processing

08:46.833 --> 08:48.418
You got it, H

08:50.253 --> 08:51.254
Are you okay?

08:51.504 --> 08:53.381
Yeah, I'm fine

08:58.595 --> 08:59.888
Horatio, what are you doing?

09:00.263 --> 09:03.350
I'm giving Al's wife his
wedding ring back

09:03.350 --> 09:04.559
That's evidence

09:04.559 --> 09:05.560
I know that

09:05.769 --> 09:07.062
You can't just give it away

09:07.312 --> 09:08.480
I'm not giving it away ...

09:09.105 --> 09:10.690
I'm giving it back

09:14.611 --> 09:17.489
Avulsive destruction of the
face and frontal calvarium

09:18.573 --> 09:21.785
Thermal damage of the epidermis
at the edges of the defect

09:22.410 --> 09:24.329
Thought I'd seen everything

09:24.788 --> 09:26.831
I'm surprised he didn't take his head clean off

09:26.831 --> 09:27.707
Yeah

09:27.707 --> 09:28.875
I rushed tox

09:28.875 --> 09:31.127
Traces of chloroform in his system

09:31.127 --> 09:32.212
That's how the bomber

09:32.212 --> 09:33.964
got the collar on him

09:37.217 --> 09:40.053
You didn't know what
hit you, did you, sugar?

09:40.053 --> 09:42.305
Rest of him doesn't look
too bad considering

09:42.555 --> 09:44.224
Looks can be deceiving

09:48.812 --> 09:50.021
My god ...

09:50.021 --> 09:51.356
what happened?

09:51.356 --> 09:52.607
"White Butterfly" effect

09:52.857 --> 09:54.651
Pressure can cause massive
internal damage

09:54.651 --> 09:55.819
Lungs burst

09:55.819 --> 09:57.570
Other organs turn to soup

10:02.284 --> 10:04.536
How's Horatio holding up?

10:05.287 --> 10:06.204
Fine

10:08.581 --> 10:10.834
At least that's what he's telling me

10:10.834 --> 10:13.420
He told me he wanted to
be down here for Al

10:13.420 --> 10:14.838
For his post?

10:14.838 --> 10:15.755
Yeah

10:16.006 --> 10:17.924
He said he could handle it

10:18.633 --> 10:19.968
What did you say to him?

10:19.968 --> 10:21.928
Told him I didn't need him down here

10:21.928 --> 10:24.639
But I knew someone who did

10:30.979 --> 10:34.107
We've missed you since
you left the squad

10:34.107 --> 10:36.610
Been too long, Felicia

10:36.610 --> 10:38.653
Al was just saying ...

10:39.487 --> 10:42.866
we need to have you
over for dinner sometime

10:44.618 --> 10:46.119
I'd like that

10:46.119 --> 10:48.455
He never wanted to talk about ...

10:53.209 --> 10:56.421
you always know there's a possibility

10:56.838 --> 10:58.798
something could go wrong ...

11:02.761 --> 11:08.642
Felicia, everything I am I owe to Al
Everything I know, he taught me

11:12.312 --> 11:13.772
How do I tell them?

11:15.649 --> 11:17.734
What do I say to them?

11:18.193 --> 11:20.654
You know what, Felicia?

11:21.947 --> 11:23.490
I don't want you to worry about it

11:29.245 --> 11:31.957
I want you to let me handle it

11:32.540 --> 11:35.627
This is for you

12:34.102 --> 12:35.312
It's not here

12:35.604 --> 12:37.439
Casing came back positive for TATP

12:37.981 --> 12:38.982
Homemade explosive

12:39.441 --> 12:40.442
Very sensitive

12:40.442 --> 12:42.193
Wouldn't want to get the shakes

12:42.861 --> 12:45.447
Not this guy, this guy's a pro

12:45.447 --> 12:47.449
Well, he sure made a beauty:

12:47.449 --> 12:49.909
Dummy switches, alternative
power source, collapsing circuits

12:49.909 --> 12:52.203
We are still missing a component

12:52.454 --> 12:53.955
The action switch is not here

12:53.955 --> 12:56.124
We covered that scene on
our hands and knees

12:56.124 --> 12:57.500
We got it all

12:57.500 --> 12:59.002
Let me say it again, it's not here

12:59.002 --> 13:01.630
Evidence just can't get up
and walk out of the room

13:01.921 --> 13:03.465
Yes, it can

13:06.843 --> 13:08.803
On their boots

13:09.220 --> 13:10.722
And there it goes

13:10.722 --> 13:12.974
So let's get it back

13:24.734 --> 13:27.946
Three engine companies
responded to that bomb call

13:29.656 --> 13:31.700
It was like a freeway
through that house

13:31.700 --> 13:33.827
And we're going to check them all

13:33.827 --> 13:35.078
Any chance

13:35.078 --> 13:36.413
it's going to lead to anything?

13:36.413 --> 13:37.664
You tell me

13:42.752 --> 13:43.962
Electric photocell

13:44.295 --> 13:45.296
Yeah

13:46.673 --> 13:48.550
This is what killed Al

13:51.261 --> 13:52.929
I'm sorry about that, H

13:53.138 --> 13:54.723
Yeah, me too

13:57.225 --> 13:58.727
Me too

14:03.565 --> 14:06.109
Calleigh?
Got something on the fabric?

14:06.109 --> 14:07.736
Flanders mesh pattern

14:07.736 --> 14:09.612
Machine-made. Size ten

14:09.612 --> 14:11.364
32-count pella linen

14:11.614 --> 14:13.116
French lace. Tres couteux

14:13.116 --> 14:14.325
- Tres bon
- Hmm

14:14.617 --> 14:15.618
- Hey
- Hey

14:15.618 --> 14:16.995
Our bomber's quite
the clothes hound

14:17.245 --> 14:18.246
He has expensive taste

14:18.246 --> 14:20.415
If he is a he

14:21.041 --> 14:23.084
A lot of women's clothing is
made with french lace

14:23.084 --> 14:24.294
Blouses, scarves...

14:24.294 --> 14:25.420
Lingerie

14:27.213 --> 14:29.466
What? I shop on Valentine's Day

14:31.134 --> 14:32.677
How you doing on the note?

14:32.677 --> 14:35.347
Great. I ran thin-layer
chromatography on the ink

14:35.764 --> 14:37.057
It's, uh, garden-variety laser printer

14:37.265 --> 14:39.225
and you can find them at any copy shop

14:39.225 --> 14:41.394
Which made me realize
I was barking up the wrong tree

14:41.978 --> 14:43.188
You analyzed the paper

14:43.438 --> 14:45.565
Exactly. It's bagasse pulp

14:45.565 --> 14:48.151
It's a treeless paper made
from sugar cane fiber

14:48.151 --> 14:50.320
It's imported primarily
from Colombia

14:50.320 --> 14:51.613
Colombia

14:51.613 --> 14:54.657
We need to find out if any
local area stores sell this

14:54.657 --> 14:56.785
There are four high-end
stationary stores here

14:56.785 --> 14:57.869
in Dade County

14:57.869 --> 14:59.329
All of them are sold out
and they're awaiting

14:59.329 --> 15:01.873
a shipment from a Columbian
import company

15:01.873 --> 15:03.666
that's owned by one Aurelio Moreno

15:03.666 --> 15:05.877
And I did some other fact checking

15:06.169 --> 15:07.295
There's been a string

15:07.545 --> 15:09.589
of necklace bomb cases
just like this one

15:09.589 --> 15:11.758
inand around Bogota

15:11.758 --> 15:13.343
The bombers stalk their victims for weeks

15:13.343 --> 15:15.011
get their routines down cold

15:15.011 --> 15:17.180
They pick only high-profile targets

15:17.180 --> 15:18.431
They're wealthy enough to pay the ransom

15:18.640 --> 15:19.766
Just like Moreno

15:19.766 --> 15:20.934
Where's that paper shipment now?

15:20.934 --> 15:22.560
It's waiting in customs impound

15:22.560 --> 15:23.395
Then I'm wondering

15:23.395 --> 15:25.605
who else might have had
access to that paper

15:32.320 --> 15:33.738
Charlie Berenger, Customs

15:34.239 --> 15:35.782
Eric Delko, CSI

15:35.782 --> 15:38.451
So my boys tell me you're
looking for paper

15:39.077 --> 15:40.370
Coded watermarks, actually

15:40.370 --> 15:42.580
It's a design pressed into
the liquid paper stock

15:42.872 --> 15:44.958
It can tell us when a particular
lot was manufactured

15:48.128 --> 15:49.546
Is this, uh, is this a restricted area?

15:50.004 --> 15:50.797
Sure

15:51.464 --> 15:53.508
Doesn't mean there's no access though

15:53.508 --> 15:57.012
Security guards, dock workers
plus any number of federal inspectors

15:57.303 --> 15:58.722
through here on a regular basis

15:59.305 --> 16:01.516
Any of them have it in for
a guy named Aurelio Moreno?

16:01.516 --> 16:02.600
Moreno?

16:02.851 --> 16:04.352
That's a real piece of business

16:04.352 --> 16:07.063
He's been investigated by the cargo cats

16:07.063 --> 16:07.772
The who?

16:07.772 --> 16:08.898
Cargo cats

16:08.898 --> 16:10.567
It's  a name we have for ourselves

16:10.567 --> 16:12.485
on the counter-smuggling task force

16:12.485 --> 16:14.195
You have a file on this guy?

16:14.195 --> 16:15.363
Yeah, sure

16:20.910 --> 16:23.997
Looks like Moreno was
doing all right for himself

16:23.997 --> 16:25.540
Better than all right

16:25.540 --> 16:28.084
Nothing moved between
South Florida and Colombia

16:28.084 --> 16:29.711
without going through him first

16:32.005 --> 16:33.006
Who's this?

16:33.006 --> 16:34.591
That's Moreno's wife

16:35.383 --> 16:36.593
Lauriana

16:36.593 --> 16:38.428
That's not his wife

16:39.929 --> 16:41.473
Esposa number two

16:41.473 --> 16:43.350
And you didn't know that?

16:46.978 --> 16:48.521
Now in order for a bomb to do its job

16:48.772 --> 16:50.523
it  needs three components

16:51.649 --> 16:52.776
Power source

16:53.777 --> 16:55.278
it needs an action switch

16:56.571 --> 16:59.074
and it needs an explosive load

16:59.074 --> 17:01.159
We wired in a photocell like the one we found

17:01.159 --> 17:03.078
melted into the fireman's boot

17:03.078 --> 17:04.119
So Al

17:04.454 --> 17:06.498
followed a render-safe procedure

17:06.790 --> 17:08.708
and he drilled in in an attempt

17:10.126 --> 17:11.586
to disrupt the power source

17:14.672 --> 17:17.550
Once the pipe was breached,
the light hit the photocell

17:17.550 --> 17:18.635
closed the circuit

17:18.635 --> 17:19.844
BOOM

17:20.345 --> 17:22.888
What kind of person
makes something like that?

17:22.888 --> 17:24.516
Well,  bombers are ego-driven

17:24.516 --> 17:27.560
They make bombs to gain control, get
revenge, sow terror

17:27.560 --> 17:29.896
Some believe they've been
betrayed by society

17:30.105 --> 17:32.273
Or betrayed by someone
they trusted

17:32.273 --> 17:34.484
Our Moreno was a busy boy

17:34.734 --> 17:36.778
He had one wife in Miami,
the other in Bogota

17:36.778 --> 17:40.198
Customs inspector at Port of Miami
told me that wife number two

17:40.699 --> 17:42.784
... came in a week ago. High season

17:43.159 --> 17:45.161
Maybe they found out
about each other

17:45.161 --> 17:46.246
Sounds like motive

17:46.246 --> 17:49.165
Yeah, maybe it's time
to talk to the wives

17:49.165 --> 17:52.377
I don't know anyone who
would want to hurt him

17:52.585 --> 17:54.462
He was hard-working, honest

17:55.422 --> 17:57.382
Aurelio was a good man

17:58.216 --> 17:59.592
He loved his family

18:00.010 --> 18:02.303
My husband was
very devoted to family

18:03.555 --> 18:05.098
He traveled quite a bit

18:05.098 --> 18:07.308
but he hated to
be away from us

18:07.308 --> 18:08.893
If there was even a weekend
he could get away

18:08.893 --> 18:10.395
he would come home

18:10.687 --> 18:15.150
Of course he had to travel for business,
but he hated it

18:15.150 --> 18:17.736
He didn't like to be away from me

18:18.028 --> 18:20.613
He never wanted to leave me

18:20.613 --> 18:22.323
I miss him so much

18:22.323 --> 18:24.576
You have no idea how
much I miss him

18:25.285 --> 18:27.871
I'm sorry for your loss

18:27.871 --> 18:30.165
We're trying to figure out who did this

18:33.168 --> 18:34.711
What's that?

18:35.795 --> 18:36.921
I'd like to ...

18:39.674 --> 18:42.177
take a swab of your
hand, if I may

18:43.219 --> 18:44.846
It might help me

18:45.096 --> 18:46.097
identify the killer

18:46.348 --> 18:47.349
Would that be all right?

18:49.726 --> 18:51.269
Let me see your left hand

18:52.145 --> 18:53.521
Would you mind if I

18:53.521 --> 18:55.231
took a hand swab?

18:55.231 --> 18:56.649
I don't understand

18:57.901 --> 18:59.402
What could be on my hand?

18:59.402 --> 19:01.071
It's just to rule out

19:01.071 --> 19:02.822
any possibility of
cross-contamination

19:05.658 --> 19:07.452
If it will help

19:10.246 --> 19:11.748
Beautiful blouse

19:12.248 --> 19:13.249
Is that french lace?

19:13.249 --> 19:14.000
Mm-hmm

19:14.584 --> 19:17.420
So, old Aurelio's got it
coming and going, huh?

19:17.420 --> 19:19.089
Plus he got a two-for-one
discount on

19:19.089 --> 19:20.423
clothing and jewelry

19:20.715 --> 19:23.927
Where does he find the energy?

19:24.386 --> 19:26.179
Okay, I'm going to go run these

19:26.429 --> 19:27.430
I'll see you in a minute

20:18.773 --> 20:20.066
Hey. Morning

20:22.569 --> 20:24.112
Take a look at this

20:24.112 --> 20:26.364
His American's wife's
hands were clean

20:26.573 --> 20:28.491
while Lauriana had trace elements

20:28.491 --> 20:30.160
of triacetone and triperoxide -TATP

20:33.204 --> 20:35.248
This is our bomber

20:36.124 --> 20:38.334
All your years on the bomb squad ...

20:40.045 --> 20:41.546
how many bombers were women?

20:42.130 --> 20:43.798
This is my first

20:44.466 --> 20:46.009
I've called the INS to see

20:46.009 --> 20:47.302
if we can hang on to her

20:47.761 --> 20:49.220
while her extradition
papers come through

20:49.220 --> 20:50.764
Horatio, stop

20:51.097 --> 20:52.640
Listen to yourself

20:53.266 --> 20:54.517
No, you listen to me

20:54.517 --> 20:56.686
This woman is not going
anywhere until I clear her

20:57.854 --> 20:59.397
How can anyone go
anywhere with you running

20:59.397 --> 21:01.566
roughshod over the evidence?

21:02.692 --> 21:03.610
Can't you see this isn't about you

21:04.027 --> 21:06.905
finding out what happened to Al?

21:12.118 --> 21:12.911
The day Sean died

21:15.955 --> 21:19.125
The day Sean died, I was at his scene

21:19.834 --> 21:21.336
Restaurant shooting

21:21.753 --> 21:23.797
Girl killed by her boyfriend

21:24.130 --> 21:26.841
I didn't realize that Sean
had gone across the street

21:27.050 --> 21:29.386
to the boyfriend's apartment

21:30.261 --> 21:31.262
He found him

21:31.638 --> 21:33.348
on the fourteenth floor balcony

21:34.224 --> 21:35.975
ready to jump

21:36.226 --> 21:39.396
Sean tried to talk him down,
like any good cop would do

21:41.815 --> 21:44.192
Guy took him over the side

21:45.360 --> 21:47.612
I saw them hit

21:47.862 --> 21:50.031
Didn't know who it was at first

21:51.700 --> 21:53.243
I worked that case

21:53.493 --> 21:55.537
I insisted on it

21:55.537 --> 21:57.580
I wanted to be there for him

21:58.873 --> 22:00.500
I couldn't

22:04.921 --> 22:07.757
Grief is grief; work is work

22:08.883 --> 22:10.844
Don't confuse the two

22:13.888 --> 22:15.098
You're thinking...

22:15.682 --> 22:18.727
You're thinking that maybe
I've missed something. Hmm

22:21.354 --> 22:25.025
Well, did you notice
Lauriana's hair and nails?

22:26.317 --> 22:28.278
Acetone and peroxide

22:29.404 --> 22:31.448
Base elements of TATP

22:32.699 --> 22:35.285
Also of nail polish and hair dye

22:37.620 --> 22:38.913
Those two women

22:39.122 --> 22:41.708
didn't bat an eye when
they got on the elevator

22:41.916 --> 22:43.460
I'm a woman, and I'm telling you

22:43.460 --> 22:45.378
they don't know each other

22:45.628 --> 22:48.298
They probably had no
idea the other exists

22:59.559 --> 23:00.643
Excuse me

23:05.148 --> 23:06.441
Horatio

23:07.317 --> 23:08.943
Where are you?

23:13.823 --> 23:16.910
We've got another bomb

23:37.442 --> 23:38.944
Any closer and I might have to file

23:38.944 --> 23:40.654
a sexual harassment suit

23:40.654 --> 23:42.322
Yes, but it wouldn't stick

23:42.322 --> 23:44.074
We don't work together anymore

23:46.201 --> 23:48.537
Why do I the feeling this
isn't a social call?

23:48.829 --> 23:51.874
Well, we have information on
the first bomb that you need

23:51.874 --> 23:54.167
You're going to have to
render-safe in the dark

23:54.167 --> 23:55.878
The device that killed Al

23:56.211 --> 23:58.046
had a photocell just like this

23:58.046 --> 23:59.840
When light hits it, it detonates

24:01.592 --> 24:04.177
Bill, would you dig
out the tarp, please?

24:04.177 --> 24:05.178
Right

24:06.305 --> 24:07.306
Who's the target?

24:07.306 --> 24:08.765
Vic's name is Maura Burgos

24:08.765 --> 24:09.975
High-end antiques dealer

24:09.975 --> 24:12.185
She was in her kitchen
when she got jumped

24:12.185 --> 24:13.854
Woke up from a
chloroform bouquet

24:13.854 --> 24:15.606
to a necklace bomb
around her neck

24:15.814 --> 24:16.857
Burgos?  Is she Columbian?

24:16.857 --> 24:17.733
Hard to say

24:18.108 --> 24:20.152
Unless that's code for
scared out of your mind

24:20.569 --> 24:22.613
How did she contact the police?

24:22.613 --> 24:24.323
Garage door opener

24:24.323 --> 24:25.490
Neighbor called it in

24:25.699 --> 24:28.619
That was quick thinking, Maura,
flapping the garage door

24:28.619 --> 24:30.537
Did you have the
opener in your pocket?

24:30.537 --> 24:32.080
My purse

24:32.623 --> 24:35.459
It was on the table
when I came to

24:36.126 --> 24:37.294
Okay.  Now stay with me, Kat

24:37.294 --> 24:38.795
I'm going to walk you through it

24:38.795 --> 24:40.714
I think this is a twin
of the other device

24:40.714 --> 24:42.507
which means the explosives
are packed up front

24:42.758 --> 24:44.760
and the safe arm will be
on the victim's right side

24:45.260 --> 24:47.346
Copy that. Approaching from the right

24:52.476 --> 24:53.185
Now remember

24:53.810 --> 24:55.312
you have to keep her calm

24:55.312 --> 24:58.398
Hey, Maura.
You know any Stevie Wonder?

25:01.735 --> 25:03.612
Hey, babe ...
everything is all right, uptight

25:05.322 --> 25:06.448
out of sight

25:09.743 --> 25:12.037
Sorry, I'm giving you dandruff

25:13.747 --> 25:15.290
Keep singing darling

25:15.290 --> 25:17.209
Everything is all right, uptight

25:20.295 --> 25:21.588
out of sight

25:21.588 --> 25:23.840
So, let's follow along the seam

25:23.840 --> 25:26.009
and that's where
the frag is largest

25:26.009 --> 25:27.135
I'm trying

25:27.427 --> 25:29.513
Housing's as smooth as a baby's butt

25:29.513 --> 25:31.098
That's because he used silicone gel

25:31.098 --> 25:33.267
sanded and buffed
with an electrostatic cloth

25:33.267 --> 25:34.977
Trying to hide this sucker

25:34.977 --> 25:37.229
but he can't hide from us,
can he, Maura?

25:37.646 --> 25:38.981
Uptight, out of sight...

25:41.024 --> 25:44.653
You need to stop as soon as you feel the
pressure ease and before you hit dead space

25:44.945 --> 25:46.488
Just a few zip-zips, Maura

25:46.488 --> 25:47.781
and we're out of here

25:47.781 --> 25:50.200
Easier than a trip to the dentist

25:50.200 --> 25:51.368
Stop the drill

25:51.368 --> 25:52.744
Kat, now wait a second now

25:52.744 --> 25:54.162
That's beginning to separate

25:54.413 --> 25:56.498
I want you to shut that drill down.
Stop the drill

26:00.919 --> 26:02.087
It's a hoax

26:02.337 --> 26:03.338
Damn thing's filled with sand

26:03.881 --> 26:05.465
I'm bringing her out

26:06.091 --> 26:07.634
No, you're not
You're going to stay right there

26:07.885 --> 26:08.886
Nobody moves

26:09.177 --> 26:10.345
Kat, listen to me

26:10.345 --> 26:11.763
There may be a secondary device

26:11.763 --> 26:13.056
Let me get Maura out of here first

26:13.307 --> 26:15.017
No-no-no! It could function in
any number of ways!

26:15.267 --> 26:16.810
Either of you moves, it could blow!

26:16.810 --> 26:18.812
This isn't your handle anymore, Horatio

26:21.690 --> 26:23.734
Am I in the path that you cleared?

26:23.734 --> 26:25.444
Yellow brick road right
under your feet

26:38.832 --> 26:42.878
Maura, should these wires
be sticking out of this clown?

26:43.795 --> 26:47.466
Yes. There was a little
balloon that broke off

26:48.508 --> 26:50.886
Okay, Maura what I need you to do

26:50.886 --> 26:53.055
is take a very good look
around the room and

26:53.055 --> 26:55.265
tell me if anything is different

26:59.728 --> 27:01.480
No, I just ...

27:04.274 --> 27:05.651
I don't know

27:05.651 --> 27:06.902
It's okay

27:14.284 --> 27:15.953
We're clear in here

27:19.623 --> 27:20.999
Deep breaths

27:21.333 --> 27:22.793
You're doing great

27:25.796 --> 27:27.339
What did  I tell you?  Mojito time

28:02.457 --> 28:03.458
Hey, Bill?

28:05.460 --> 28:06.461
Yeah, boss?

28:06.461 --> 28:07.629
Let's bring out the E.C.M

28:07.629 --> 28:08.922
and let's get everybody away

28:09.131 --> 28:10.549
from this kid on
the bike right now

28:10.757 --> 28:11.425
You got it

28:17.180 --> 28:18.724
Nice bike

28:20.809 --> 28:22.311
- What is that?
- BMX

28:23.187 --> 28:23.979
That is cool

28:26.023 --> 28:27.524
Electronic counter measure?

28:27.816 --> 28:30.402
He's jamming every radio
signal in the area

28:30.736 --> 28:32.821
In case the bomber's
trying to remote-detonate

28:32.821 --> 28:34.740
Back in my day

28:34.740 --> 28:35.866
I had the, uh sting ray

28:36.950 --> 28:38.493
with a banana seat
and the racing slicks

28:38.744 --> 28:40.454
but that was a long time ago

28:40.454 --> 28:41.872
What's your name?

28:41.872 --> 28:42.956
Conner

28:43.749 --> 28:46.126
You know, it is, um,
it is a little big for you

28:46.126 --> 28:47.294
Where's you get it?

28:47.628 --> 28:48.670
The man said I could keep it
if I brought the package

28:48.879 --> 28:50.672
to his friend

28:51.590 --> 28:53.508
He said to wait for him here

29:01.850 --> 29:03.393
I did something bad, didn't I?

29:03.393 --> 29:05.020
No, you didn't, Conner

29:05.020 --> 29:06.647
Everything's fine

29:06.647 --> 29:08.565
Here's what I want you to do, though

29:09.316 --> 29:11.068
I want you just sit tight

29:11.527 --> 29:13.070
and keep your eyes on me

29:13.070 --> 29:14.238
Can you do that?

29:16.323 --> 29:17.324
Good. Now, I'm just going to
take a look at your bike

29:25.082 --> 29:26.333
Hey, you like chocolate?

29:26.583 --> 29:28.126
How'd you know?

29:30.963 --> 29:32.506
All kids like chocolate

29:32.798 --> 29:35.384
Okay, now here's what we're
going to do next, Conner

29:35.676 --> 29:39.555
Very slowly ... in slow motion

29:40.055 --> 29:41.598
I want you to get off your bike

29:47.187 --> 29:48.188
Beautiful

29:48.647 --> 29:50.148
Conner, good job

29:50.440 --> 29:52.192
Now, just as slowly
I want you to walk

29:52.442 --> 29:54.361
not run right to those

29:54.611 --> 29:56.154
police officers right there

30:01.535 --> 30:02.953
Good job, Conner

30:29.688 --> 30:30.731
A new robot?

30:30.731 --> 30:32.399
Yeah, "Andros."

30:32.399 --> 30:35.068
Tracks a little smoother
than the old one

30:39.531 --> 30:40.908
Conner, I'm going to
comb your hair

30:40.908 --> 30:42.534
to see if the man who gave
you the package

30:42.743 --> 30:45.829
left anything on you, okay?

30:46.413 --> 30:48.957
I know the Detective asked you already

30:48.957 --> 30:52.294
but can you remember
anything about that man?

30:55.214 --> 30:56.089
That's okay

30:56.506 --> 30:57.507
I forget too

30:57.799 --> 30:59.843
Especially when I'm scared

31:01.053 --> 31:03.180
You found me my target?

31:03.513 --> 31:05.057
Green is for go if this is

31:05.307 --> 31:07.935
the same type of device

31:10.646 --> 31:14.024
Conner, did the man have light hair?

31:14.441 --> 31:17.027
Yeah ... light brown

31:17.402 --> 31:19.446
Kinda wavy

31:19.821 --> 31:21.949
See? You did remember something

31:31.166 --> 31:32.709
You're right on line, Bill

31:32.709 --> 31:34.336
Right on line

31:47.891 --> 31:49.476
Laser's on target

31:49.685 --> 31:50.936
What's it going to do?

31:51.228 --> 31:53.730
Little gizmo on top's
called a "disrupter."

31:53.981 --> 31:55.691
This of it as a water pistol only

31:55.691 --> 31:57.526
it fires nine hundred
feet per second

31:57.734 --> 32:00.279
Water doesn't compress,
it shoots out like steel rebar

32:00.279 --> 32:03.031
If we get lucky, we can take
out this power source

32:03.031 --> 32:04.116
Circuit interruptus

32:04.366 --> 32:05.909
And if we don't?

32:05.909 --> 32:08.036
And if we don't we're going to have
a very large crime scene to process

32:08.036 --> 32:09.246
Let's go

32:10.789 --> 32:11.790
Fire in the hole!

32:11.790 --> 32:13.959
Fire in the hole!

32:30.934 --> 32:32.436
All clear

32:37.900 --> 32:39.401
Okay.
The thing I don't understand

32:39.401 --> 32:41.361
if the bomber's after the girl

32:41.361 --> 32:43.530
why plant a hoax in her house?

32:43.530 --> 32:46.575
Calculate the distance between
the house and the sign

32:49.077 --> 32:50.078
Couple hundred feet?

32:50.287 --> 32:51.830
I'd say five hundred feet
and that's exactly where

32:51.830 --> 32:56.668
the bomb squad would place containment
and command post and that's by the book, isn't it?

32:56.960 --> 32:59.588
You're saying this guy
knows procedure?

32:59.588 --> 33:02.591
The victims were decoys.
He's after the bomb squad

33:09.788 --> 33:11.290
Well, the first bomb,
ladies and gentlemen

33:11.290 --> 33:13.709
was designed to kill the victim
and the bomb tech

33:13.709 --> 33:16.003
Second bomb was a
decoy to lure them in

33:16.295 --> 33:18.881
And the third bomb was designed
to blow them all to smithereens

33:18.881 --> 33:20.507
All those little pieces

33:20.507 --> 33:23.135
It's hard to believe
they can be so deadly

33:23.135 --> 33:25.638
Fourteen ounces of semtex
brought down that plane over Lockerbie

33:25.930 --> 33:27.473
and that's smaller than a bag of coffee

33:27.765 --> 33:31.101
Killed all 259 passengers
eleven on the ground

33:31.101 --> 33:32.811
And this is gonna bring us
straight to the bomber

33:32.811 --> 33:34.480
so Speed, swab everything

33:34.480 --> 33:36.565
Eric, concentrate on the switches.
They're not handmade

33:36.565 --> 33:40.778
so let's find out the manufacturer's specs
the make and model of every item

33:41.528 --> 33:43.072
And Calleigh let's work on the wiring

33:43.405 --> 33:45.449
Let's look for any cuttings

33:45.449 --> 33:47.159
or tool markings that seem odd, okay?

33:47.493 --> 33:48.494
And let's put a rush on this, people

33:48.494 --> 33:50.120
It is my belief that the bomb squad is

33:50.120 --> 33:51.455
about to get another call

33:51.455 --> 33:52.915
What are you going to do, boss?

33:52.915 --> 33:55.167
I'm going to look for the signature

33:55.709 --> 33:58.295
Every bomber has a signature

33:58.295 --> 34:00.172
I'm going to find his

34:54.935 --> 34:58.272
I can tell you it's light brown, auburn
in reflectivity a fragment of three inches

34:58.272 --> 35:00.107
with an angle tip cut

35:01.191 --> 35:04.820
Cortical cell is damaged,
medulla, fractional

35:05.029 --> 35:08.657
But none of that is going
to give you a name

35:10.909 --> 35:14.538
I can also tell you that your
standing there is not going to

35:14.538 --> 35:17.207
grow a hair tag at the
end of the sample

35:17.207 --> 35:21.045
I need everybody
in the layout room

35:21.045 --> 35:22.713
You miss it, don't you?

35:22.713 --> 35:24.048
Being on the front lines

35:24.048 --> 35:25.883
The simple answer is no

35:25.883 --> 35:27.551
I saw you out there

35:27.551 --> 35:29.803
Why leave something you're good at?

35:29.803 --> 35:31.430
You ever been in a horse race?

35:31.430 --> 35:33.682
Life's enough of a gamble

35:33.682 --> 35:36.852
Some horses run better in a harness

35:37.102 --> 35:38.604
and the science is

35:39.605 --> 35:41.440
my discipline

35:41.732 --> 35:43.776
I'll see you in there

35:43.776 --> 35:45.653
What do we know?

35:45.653 --> 35:48.906
A couple of components were
brand-name capacitors and switches

35:48.906 --> 35:50.991
but the relay base grommets
were painted, not clear

35:50.991 --> 35:51.951
- Counterfeit?
- Looks that way

35:51.951 --> 35:53.202
Find out where they were sold, Speed?

35:53.786 --> 35:55.037
No sweat, no saliva, no hand lotion

35:55.287 --> 35:57.164
But there were traces of
chlordane

35:57.164 --> 35:59.124
Insecticide?

35:59.124 --> 36:00.334
Banned insecticide

36:00.334 --> 36:01.835
It's still in use in some

36:01.835 --> 36:04.046
coffee growing countries,
but I don't have a manufacturer yet

36:04.255 --> 36:05.798
Keep looking.
Calleigh?

36:05.798 --> 36:07.466
All wire ends were straight-edged

36:07.466 --> 36:09.802
standard wire cutters.  Nothing fancy.
It's a dead end

36:11.053 --> 36:11.971
Afraid I've also got a dead end, literally

36:14.890 --> 36:17.476
- Hair is human.  Doesn't belong to our guy
- How do you know without a skin tag?

36:17.476 --> 36:19.436
Faint traces of silicone adhesive at the root

36:19.436 --> 36:21.939
It came from a wig

36:25.651 --> 36:28.195
French lace -- from the
window at the Moreno house

36:28.195 --> 36:30.030
It's also used on high-end toupees
It gives a more natural look to the hairline

36:31.490 --> 36:33.534
Lace on a rug

36:33.534 --> 36:35.202
Well, shoot me if it
comes to that

36:36.787 --> 36:37.538
What did you find from the bomb?

36:37.746 --> 36:39.248
Signature is shrink-wrapped wires

36:39.248 --> 36:41.750
laid end to end ...

36:42.167 --> 36:45.254
leads twisted  into a counterclockwise
direction but that, ladies and gentlemen

36:45.546 --> 36:46.922
is not the big deal with this guy

36:47.548 --> 36:48.591
This guy is

36:48.841 --> 36:49.883
a show-off

36:50.342 --> 36:51.885
How can you get that from a bomb?

36:52.094 --> 36:54.138
Every twist of every wire is about him:

36:54.138 --> 36:56.307
"Look at me.  Look at how clever I am."

36:56.307 --> 36:57.725
Still doesn't give us a name

36:57.725 --> 36:59.393
Okay.  Let's go back to the top

36:59.393 --> 37:00.894
He's been around bombs

37:00.894 --> 37:02.563
Maybe he has a grudge

37:02.563 --> 37:03.689
Wears a toupee

37:03.689 --> 37:04.898
Out of necessity ... chemo?

37:05.399 --> 37:06.609
Maybe he's had some close calls

37:07.443 --> 37:08.277
Maybe he burned his head

37:08.277 --> 37:09.278
in some sort of explosion

37:09.528 --> 37:10.279
That could account for the wig

37:10.529 --> 37:11.530
And he's making his bombs
out of counterfeit parts

37:11.905 --> 37:13.407
In some place with some

37:13.949 --> 37:15.993
- ... heavy-duty insecticide
- So, where do counterfeit parts

37:16.702 --> 37:19.288
and banned insecticide come together?

37:19.288 --> 37:20.372
Both are illegal imports

37:20.372 --> 37:21.832
And Moreno was importing
goods from Colombia

37:21.832 --> 37:24.043
and so was Maura Burgos

37:24.376 --> 37:25.377
And it has to go through where?

37:25.377 --> 37:27.379
U.S. Customs

37:27.755 --> 37:29.048
Let's go back to that

37:29.048 --> 37:31.800
impound warehouse

37:49.068 --> 37:50.569
What do you got?

37:50.819 --> 37:51.820
These are all the agents

37:52.196 --> 37:54.782
with access to the Moreno and Burgos
files combined with warehouse access

37:57.368 --> 37:58.911
Customs enforcement agent
Charlie Berenger. There it is

37:59.912 --> 38:00.746
That's who Delko talked to

38:01.163 --> 38:02.665
- You know him?
- A long time ago

38:02.665 --> 38:03.874
Radio cars are on their way

38:04.083 --> 38:05.918
Okay, be careful of that

38:05.918 --> 38:07.336
He gets wind of it,
he may set another device

38:07.336 --> 38:09.046
We should stand down and
wait for backup Horatio

38:09.046 --> 38:11.257
This is not a good plan

38:12.675 --> 38:14.176
He's killing my friends

38:14.802 --> 38:16.637
And he's talking to me

38:17.388 --> 38:19.014
I'm going in

39:05.060 --> 39:06.895
Horatio?

39:14.236 --> 39:15.487
Charlie B.

39:16.113 --> 39:17.948
Horatio Caine

39:18.574 --> 39:20.451
It's been a while

39:21.035 --> 39:22.536
- Hey, nice work with the kid on the bike
- Thank you

39:25.539 --> 39:29.168
Just a couple of old bomb
techs talking, right, Charlie?

39:30.085 --> 39:31.962
1998 was a raw deal for
you when that bomb blew ...

39:31.962 --> 39:34.423
wasn't it?

39:34.423 --> 39:36.800
You could have
beaten that timer

39:36.800 --> 39:40.804
I would've ... if I didn't have
Humhreys screaming in my ear

39:40.804 --> 39:43.140
Al made a big mistake
with you, Charlie

39:43.349 --> 39:45.392
He underestimated you, didn't he?

39:45.392 --> 39:48.270
But now you're
going to show them

39:48.520 --> 39:51.440
You picked victims
to mislead the squad

39:53.817 --> 39:55.861
You made them think they were
dealing with colombian bomb

39:57.655 --> 40:01.033
but all the while, you were

40:01.033 --> 40:03.911
setting them up

40:07.581 --> 40:09.124
All right, partner, you know
what you're doing now?

40:09.500 --> 40:11.210
Attaboy. All right. Go on now

40:12.544 --> 40:13.754
Watch yourself, now.
Be careful

40:14.171 --> 40:15.714
And that last device?
A work of art, Charlie

40:15.965 --> 40:19.176
Collapsing parallel circuits

40:19.677 --> 40:21.971
Michelangelo would've been envious

40:22.304 --> 40:25.808
I've done the
reconstruction, Charlie

40:26.141 --> 40:28.936
and Al should have never
taken you off that squad

40:28.936 --> 40:30.604
You were too good for that

40:30.604 --> 40:31.772
I was

40:32.064 --> 40:32.898
Yeah

40:33.357 --> 40:35.526
Look where it got me

40:37.653 --> 40:39.738
Everybody has a bad day

40:39.738 --> 40:41.407
Today could be mine

40:41.407 --> 40:45.077
Trying to take you down could
get us both blown up couldn't it?

40:47.079 --> 40:50.374
You think I can't get out of this?
I couldn't

40:51.750 --> 40:53.085
I couldn't find the safe-arming switch

40:53.294 --> 40:55.337
Yeah, well, it's easy to miss

40:59.008 --> 41:01.051
You want a second shot at it?

41:03.554 --> 41:05.806
You know, if you're wrong ...

41:06.515 --> 41:07.558
BOOM

41:10.102 --> 41:10.936
That's true

41:25.159 --> 41:26.160
Freeze!

41:31.540 --> 41:33.751
Turn around, Charlie

41:48.349 --> 41:49.850
We're clear

41:50.100 --> 41:51.769
Okay, get on the ground

41:56.106 --> 41:57.524
Get him out of my sight

42:05.616 --> 42:06.617
So ...

42:07.242 --> 42:10.037
You worked the case
and still cleared it

42:10.037 --> 42:11.580
Guess I was wrong

42:12.039 --> 42:13.290
You weren't wrong

42:13.540 --> 42:15.793
I just got hung up on the wives

42:16.543 --> 42:17.920
You recovered

42:18.462 --> 42:21.382
You know what I'm going
to miss most about Al?

42:23.676 --> 42:25.261
Most people ...

42:26.262 --> 42:27.471
Gentlemen

42:27.721 --> 42:30.683
Most people ...
make you earn their respect

42:31.976 --> 42:35.104
And with Al, that's where you started

42:45.698 --> 42:47.116
Coming in?

42:47.574 --> 42:48.993
In a minute

42:50.327 --> 42:51.620
Hey

42:52.454 --> 42:53.455
Thank you

42:53.998 --> 42:55.374
For what?

42:56.667 --> 42:58.294
For knowing the difference

43:10.764 --> 43:12.099
Felicia
