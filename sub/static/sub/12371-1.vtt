THERE'S THE MOUNTAIN.
THIS MUST BE THE SPOT.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.399
I NEVER THOUGHT
WE'D MAKE IT.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.767
THESE RUINS
GOT TO BE CLOSE.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.569
LET'S GO.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.788
THAT'S IT!
WE FOUND IT!

01:01.195 --> 01:03.864
THE LOST HORSE
OF THE FIRST T'ANG
EMPEROR,

01:03.897 --> 01:06.467
BURIED IN HIS TOMB
IN THE SEVENTH
CENTURY.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.701
IT'S THE DISCOVERY
OF A LIFETIME.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.171
AND IT'S WORTH
A FORTUNE!

01:14.642 --> 01:17.345
IS THE HORSE STOWED
SAFELY BELOW?

01:17.378 --> 01:20.548
DON'T WORRY.
I SENT IT AHEAD TO MY WIFE.

01:20.581 --> 01:24.685
YOUR WIFE?
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
TO TAKE IT WITH US.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.420
IT'S SAFER THIS WAY.

01:26.454 --> 01:30.324
COME ON. LET'S SHIP
OUT BEFORE THE STORM
GETS ANY WORSE.

LOT NUMBER 123,

02:06.727 --> 02:09.697
THE GUARDIAN HORSE
FROM THE ANCIENT T'ANG DYNASTY.

02:09.729 --> 02:13.701
ONE OF A PAIR, IT'S
THE ONLY KNOWN EXISTING STATUE.

02:13.734 --> 02:17.705
ANOTHER ONE WAS RUMORED TO HAVE
BEEN UNCOVERED SEVERAL YEARS
AGO, BUT HAS NEVER SURFACED.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.474
WE WILL START THE BIDDING
WITH $20 MILLION.

02:20.508 --> 02:23.711
OH, $20 MILLION.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.181
AND TO THINK THERE MIGHT
BE ANOTHER ONE OUT THERE
JUST LIKE IT.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.450
I WONDER
WHERE IT COULD BE...

02:29.483 --> 02:33.321
AND WHAT SORT OF PERSON
WOULD HAVE IT.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.624
I WONDER
WHAT THEIR STORY IS.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.528
* HERE'S THE STORY
OF A LOVELY LADY *

02:40.561 --> 02:44.365
* WHO WAS BRINGING UP
3 VERY LOVELY GIRLS *

02:44.398 --> 02:47.301
* ALL OF THEM
HAD HAIR OF GOLD *

02:47.335 --> 02:48.869
* LIKE THEIR MOTHER

02:48.902 --> 02:51.972
* THE YOUNGEST ONE
IN CURLS *

02:52.005 --> 02:55.809
* HERE'S THE STORY
OF A MAN NAMED BRADY *

02:55.843 --> 02:59.613
* WHO WAS BUSY
WITH 3 BOYS OF HIS OWN *

02:59.647 --> 03:03.417
* THEY WERE 4 MEN
LIVING ALL TOGETHER *

03:03.451 --> 03:06.420
* YET THEY WERE
ALL ALONE *

03:06.454 --> 03:10.291
* TILL THE ONE DAY
WHEN THE LADY MET THIS FELLOW *

03:10.324 --> 03:13.994
* AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS
MUCH MORE THAN A HUNCH *

03:14.027 --> 03:17.831
* THAT THIS GROUP MUST
SOMEHOW FORM A FAMILY *

03:17.865 --> 03:20.934
* THAT'S THE WAY WE ALL BECAME
THE BRADY BUNCH *

03:20.968 --> 03:23.371

I JUST LOVE
THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.324
SO MANY BOYS WROTE
IN MY YEARBOOK.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.493
LUCKY I ORDERED ONE
WITH EXTRA PAGES.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.328
THAT'S NICE, MARCIA.

03:47.361 --> 03:52.333
LOOK. CLARK TYSON
EVEN WROTE ME A MESSAGE
WITH FRENCH IN IT.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.867
"MENAGE A TROIS."

03:53.901 --> 03:56.537
I BET THAT MEANS
"YOU'RE THE MOST."

03:56.570 --> 04:00.274
SO, JAN, DID ANY BOYS WRITE
MESSAGES IN YOUR YEARBOOK?

04:00.308 --> 04:02.676

ANY MESSAGES.

TO HAVE YOUR ORTHODONTIST

04:20.327 --> 04:22.696

THERE'S SOME KIND OF WIRE

THAT GIVES YOU 50 CHANNELS?

04:34.475 --> 04:36.310
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET UP

HOW'S THAT DRAWING
COMING, CHAMP?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.594
NOT SO GOOD, MOM.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.996
WHY DO I HAVE TO WORK
IN DAD'S ARCHITECTURE FIRM
THIS SUMMER?

04:56.029 --> 04:58.399
WHY CAN'T DAD HAVE
AN EXCITING JOB?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.033
LIKE, TOMMY'S DAD
IS A FIREMAN,

05:00.067 --> 05:02.736
SO HE GETS TO HANG OUT
AT THE STATION ALL SUMMER.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.805
AND EDDIE'S DAD
IS A BOXER,

05:04.838 --> 05:08.409
SO HE GETS TO HANG OUT
AT THE GYM AND MOP UP
ALL THE BLOOD AND THE SWEAT.

05:08.442 --> 05:11.612
AND WHO DO YOU THINK
DESIGNED THAT FIREHOUSE
AND THAT GYM?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.013
YOU MEAN...

05:13.046 --> 05:14.348
THAT'S RIGHT--

05:14.382 --> 05:16.817
AN ARCHITECT
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.019
WHY, IF YOU WERE
AN ARCHITECT,

05:19.052 --> 05:20.020
YOU COULD DESIGN A BUILDING

05:20.053 --> 05:21.622
WHERE THEY BUILD
ROCKET SHIPS

05:21.655 --> 05:22.790
THAT FLY TO THE MOON.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.759
THE MOON? WOW!

05:25.793 --> 05:28.629
BUT WHAT IF
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.431
I TRIED TO DRAW
A PICTURE OF OUR HOUSE,

05:30.464 --> 05:32.766
AND IT TURNED OUT LOUSY.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.903
IT'S NOT BAD
FOR A FIRST TRY,
PETER.

05:35.936 --> 05:39.907
IF YOU KEEP PRACTICING,
ONE DAY YOU'LL BE
AS GOOD AS YOUR FATHER.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.442
THANKS, MOM.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.611
I WILL.

DELICIOUS, ALICE.

I'VE RENTED THE TABLES, AND
I'VE ORDERED THE MEAT FROM SAM.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.399
THAT SAM
IS SO THOUGHTFUL.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.401
HE PROMISED TO SLIP ME
A SPECIAL STEAK.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.802
THAT'S GREAT,
ALICE.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.938
THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE BEST ANNIVERSARY PRESENT

06:10.971 --> 06:12.039

06:12.072 --> 06:13.674
I SURE HOPE SO,
ALICE.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.076
I THOUGHT A WEDDING CEREMONY
TO RENEW OUR VOWS

06:16.109 --> 06:17.811
WOULD BE
THE PERFECT SURPRISE.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.112

OH, QUIET, ALICE.

SHE DOESN'T SUSPECT
A THING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHAT.

DOESN'T SUSPECT WHAT

ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHAT?

IS DOING FOR YOU-KNOW-WHOM

TO HAVE IT GOING ON

THE FAD TO CALL
YOUR PARENTS

07:58.746 --> 08:00.213

FIRST NAMES,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.583
BUT AROUND HERE,
I'D STILL LIKE TO
BE KNOWN AS DAD.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.217
OH, SORRY, DAD.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.220
IT'S JUST THAT I'M GOING
TO BE A SENIOR NEXT YEAR,

TO MAKE SOME CHANGES
AROUND HERE.

TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

INTO THE ATTIC.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.233
YOU'RE WHAT?

08:20.267 --> 08:22.670
BUT WHO SAID
YOU COULD DO THAT?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.237

MY OWN ROOM, TOO!

08:26.907 --> 08:28.576

WHICH MEANS I GET
TO HAVE MY OWN PAD.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.881

THE TIMES, GREG.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.850
THERE'S A NEW THING
CALLED WOMEN'S LIB.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.952
IT MEANS WOMEN GET
EVERYTHING THEY WANT.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.856
WELL, I'M
NOT BACKING DOWN.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.025
WELL, NEITHER AM I.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.596

ONLY ONE WAY
TO SETTLE THIS.

TO THE ANTIQUE SHOP

09:58.899 --> 10:01.168

IN THE MORNING?

JUST A MINUTE, KIDS.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.778

SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.787
I'LL GO FIRST
BECAUSE I'M
THE PRETTIEST.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.790
SEE, WE BUILT
THE HOUSE OF CARDS

10:22.823 --> 10:24.257
TO DECIDE WHO
GETS THE ATTIC.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.959
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR
THAT GREG GETS THE ATTIC

10:25.993 --> 10:27.360
JUST BECAUSE HE'S A BOY.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.663
Jan: YEAH. MARCIA SHOULD GET IT.
SHE HAS MORE THINGS.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.331
Greg: I DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR TO GIVE IT
TO MARCIA

10:31.364 --> 10:32.933
JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S A GIRL.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.234

MALE CHAUVINIST REMARK!

10:34.267 --> 10:36.670
Mike: QUIET!
QUIET! QUIET!

10:36.704 --> 10:40.173
NOW, WE BRADYS HAVE TO STICK
TOGETHER, OR WE'LL FALL APART,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.810
MUCH LIKE
THAT HOUSE OF CARDS.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.345
YOU SEE, A DECK CONSISTS
OF 52 CARDS,

10:45.378 --> 10:49.349
AND IF THE HEARTS DIDN'T
WORK WITH THE DIAMONDS
AND THE SPADES WITH THE CLUBS,

10:49.382 --> 10:51.952
THEN HOW THE HECK COULD WE
EVER PLAY A GAME OF GIN RUMMY?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.955
SO, IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT
OF TOGETHERNESS,

10:54.988 --> 10:57.925
I'M SURE YOU KIDS KNOW
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.298
MIKE, MAYBE YOU
BETTER TELL THEM.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.300
WHY, SHARE THE ATTIC,
OF COURSE.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.702

SHARE THE ATTIC?

11:10.337 --> 11:11.438

TO BE KIDDING!

YOU UNDERSTAND--

SEND CINDY
TO A SPECIAL SCHOOL.
