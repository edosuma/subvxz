00:11.261 --> 00:12.637
Hello.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.214
-Here you are, my lady.
-Thank you.

00:16.392 --> 00:19.850
It's beautiful, but I feel
self-conscious even borrowing it.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.978
It shouldn't stay hidden
in the LuthorCorp safe.

00:23.148 --> 00:26.936
It needs to be worn for the very ﬁrst time
on the neck of a beautiful woman.

00:27.111 --> 00:28.601
It's perfect, Martha.

00:29.071 --> 00:32.734
But now, it's time to meet
the money bags of Metropolis.

00:32.908 --> 00:37.026
You'll need them to fund your bid
for the United States Senate.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.749
Okay, now remember this is a party.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.125
I know, I know.

00:45.295 --> 00:49.129
Stay away from religion, politics
and bad dye jobs.

00:53.929 --> 00:54.918
Ollie.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.803
It's been too long.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.589
Come over here.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.883
-Hello.
-Hi, Oliver.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.307
Mr. Westoott and his wife, Candice.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.312
I'd like to introduce you to Lois Lane.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.859
Hey.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.646
Simon Westoott.

01:11.155 --> 01:12.315
It's my pleasure.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.153
Likewise.

01:15.492 --> 01:19.076
So I wanted to tell you
that I thought you were so eloquent...

01:19.246 --> 01:21.237
...at the congressional
indictment hearings.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.991
Sorry about your oil tanker.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.790
I'd hate to be a pelican
in that harbor, huh?

01:29.339 --> 01:30.920
Well, we're gonna go.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.045
That's our cue, so....

01:35.554 --> 01:40.674
Guess I forgot to add public humiliation
to the list of cocktail-party don'ts.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.344
I'm gonna go get us a drink, okay?

01:45.522 --> 01:46.602
Just wait here...

01:46.899 --> 01:50.517
...and don't talk to anybody,
okay?

01:59.453 --> 02:02.786
And that you've had a chance
to reconnect with some old friends.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.698
Right now, though, I'd like to introduce
you to someone...

02:05.876 --> 02:07.867
...who I hope will be a new friend.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.502
A valuable new friend.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.379
Someone I'm sure you'll be glad
to have on your side.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.793
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce
to you our Kansas state senator...

02:17.971 --> 02:22.214
...and your future United States senator,
Martha Kent.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.058
Thank you very much.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.728
Thank you.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.526
Hey.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.407
Excuse me.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.246
Give me the necklace.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.169
You forgot to say please.

04:10.167 --> 04:14.831
I couldn't ID the guy,
but he didn't exactly stick around to chat.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.880
You told Mr. Luthor
that you almost caught the guy.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.758
Yet you expect me to believe
you didn't see anything?

04:21.929 --> 04:26.798
Look, Lionel Luthor pays SafeTex what,
a gazillion dollars for personal security?

04:26.975 --> 04:30.843
So don't blame me if you let a Boy Scout
with an archery badge crash his party.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.351
Okay.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.902
I think Ms. Lane's made her point.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.310
Wouldn't you say?

04:44.576 --> 04:46.908
She'll call you
if she remembers anything.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.326
Evening.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.581
So, what aren't you telling him?

05:01.510 --> 05:04.547
| just nabbed the story of my life.

05:05.889 --> 05:10.633
William Tell's not the only one who
walked away with a serious party favor.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.399
Mr. Queen?

05:17.526 --> 05:18.857
My mom told me you were here.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.144
Smallville, it's almost midnight.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.487
Smallville?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.273
You're Clark Kent?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.195
You must be Oliver Queen.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.530
Yeah.

05:36.878 --> 05:40.166
This is funny, it's just-- You know,
the way Lois talked about you...

05:40.340 --> 05:43.252
-...I thought you were a little more—
-I could use some water.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.088
Little more what?

05:46.263 --> 05:47.252
Well....

05:47.597 --> 05:48.586
Of a geek?

05:48.765 --> 05:52.349
Well, you're not exactly jumping
the velvet ropes at nightclubs, so....

05:52.644 --> 05:56.262
It's nice to see that Lois has found
someone who can overlook her personality.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.101
Well, don't worry about it, Clark.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.266
If I lived with such a beautiful woman...

06:00.444 --> 06:03.902
...I probably would've masked my feelings
in sarcasm too.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.110
-Feelings?
-Feelings?

06:08.285 --> 06:11.072
Little advice, Freud Jr., there,
stick with your day job.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.157
I'm here to get that necklace back.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.913
Last thing I want is my mom
indebted to Lionel Luthor.

06:16.084 --> 06:20.077
She should have thought of that before
she accepted his help with her fundraising.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.588
If you're really championing
the cause of pick-pocketed billionaires...

06:23.759 --> 06:25.841
...you might wanna add a few more
to the list.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.260
What, Lionel Luthor is not the only victim?

06:28.430 --> 06:31.342
Over a dozen of Metropolis's
who's who have been hit recently.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.093
Good, then there's some leads.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.806
Well, not if all the victims
were as uncooperative as Lionel Luthor.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.557
Do you ﬁnd it interesting
that he never called the police?

06:42.486 --> 06:46.024
Okay, if you boys are done
marking your territory--

06:46.198 --> 06:50.032
Which, for clariﬁcation, is not me.
--l have a front-page article...

06:50.202 --> 06:51.988
...that's missing a few key details.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.493
Good night, boys.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.574
Now, play nice.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.832
What was with that sprint
up the last hill?

07:07.010 --> 07:10.002
| always suspected
you couldn't handle me.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.677
Dr. Groll.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.762
Did we have a meeting?

07:17.229 --> 07:20.016
No, I just need a few words with you...

07:20.732 --> 07:21.892
...in private.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.729
Well, you can say anything
in front of Ms. Lang.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.189
-lt's about the device.
-Please.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.544
Where'd you get that?

07:46.550 --> 07:48.006
I found it.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.095
And I asked Dr. Groll
to ﬁgure out what it was.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.844
Some kind of power source...

07:53.140 --> 07:55.176
...beyond anything developed on Earth.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.215
If we could understand the technology...

07:57.394 --> 07:59.476
...it could solve
the planet's energy crisis.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.058
Well, for someone on the verge
of saving the world...

08:02.232 --> 08:04.644
...your enthusiasm seems tempered.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.392
There is one risk.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.020
If it fell into the wrong hands--

08:10.198 --> 08:12.154
It could be used as a weapon.

08:14.161 --> 08:18.495
So if it's so dangerous,
shouldn't you hand it in to the government?

08:19.416 --> 08:22.249
Then he'd lose any chance
at a Nobel Prize.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.909
Isn't that right, Dr. Groll?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.461
What do you want me to do?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.798
Every breakthrough has its challenges.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.258
Keep working.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.050
Very well.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.782
Hey.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.233
Let me guess.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.869
You need help researching
your next article.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.247
Yeah. The Inquisitor's search engine...

09:02.417 --> 09:05.159
...consists of a highlighter
and the yellow pages.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.750
Does Mrs. Kent know
that you're still moonlighting on her?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.173
Are you kidding me?
I've got this double identity thing down.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.460
Besides, I told her all about it
this morning.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.048
All right.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.965
So, what's the story
worth bringing out the alter-Lois?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.929
Actually, you know, now that we're both
in the same biz...

09:22.103 --> 09:24.515
...I probably shouldn't be
leaking my story.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.888
I can't believe you don't trust me.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.559
It's not all of you I don't trust,
it's just one little side of you.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.523
Lois, I'm not gonna scoop your story.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.813
But watching you bumble
through our database...

09:34.991 --> 09:37.152
...is like watching Clark try and dance.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.316
Come on.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.577
Lois, tell me what you got.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.572
Okay.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.455
l scooped this off the scumbag
before he ran away.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.961
There's some writing on the inside
but it's faded.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.463
Yeah, this could take a little while.

10:52.152 --> 10:56.486
Well, I haven't seen you
since the world was falling down around us.

10:56.656 --> 11:01.901
And I hear you have got yourself
a new landlord.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.452
I assume that Lex
told you we were together.

11:05.582 --> 11:10.292
Mr. Luthor, if you called me here
to discuss my relationship with Lex—

11:10.462 --> 11:13.329
Oh, that would be wildly inappropriate,
wouldn't it?

11:13.757 --> 11:16.715
Unless you consider
that the last time you and I spoke...

11:16.885 --> 11:20.719
...we were discussing
which one of us was going to kill Lex.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.761
He wasn't himself.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.597
But you were. Completely yourself.

11:29.773 --> 11:34.233
And unless I'm mistaken, the discussion
was due to the fact that Lex--

11:34.402 --> 11:36.393
Please sit down.

11:36.571 --> 11:40.780
--was obsessed
with a piece of alien technology...

11:40.950 --> 11:44.909
...inﬁnitely too dangerous
for any of us to comprehend.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.412
Does this sound familiar to you at all?

11:48.416 --> 11:51.783
Mr. Luthor, this is all behind us now.

11:51.961 --> 11:57.046
Well, it's obvious that any trust you
have for me only works in times of crisis.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.801
But we both know, Ms. Lang,
that the crisis is far from over.

12:01.429 --> 12:05.513
-Lex salvaged that piece of technology—
-Why do you think I moved in the mansion?

12:05.850 --> 12:06.839
Please tell me.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.134
Mr. Luthor, I care about Lex.

12:09.312 --> 12:13.055
But part of being with him
is protecting Lex from himself.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.975
I'm not naive,
I know that comes with the territory.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.985
Apparently,
Lex has ﬁnally found his equal.

12:19.614 --> 12:23.232
But watching over him,
that is not enough.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.150
Ms. Lang...

12:25.328 --> 12:30.118
...Lex is using every resource
available to him to unlock the mystery...

12:30.291 --> 12:34.000
...of that Pandora's box that he somehow
managed to get ahold of.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.837
Once he opens it...

12:38.007 --> 12:41.841
...and unleashes
whatever is in it to the world....

12:44.681 --> 12:47.548
Well, we may not be lucky enough
to close it...

12:47.725 --> 12:49.511
...this time.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.062
What do you think we should do?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.855
Destroy it.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.614
"The Green Arrow Bandit."

13:08.788 --> 13:10.699
Doesn't really roll off the tongue.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.750
This guy steals your boss's necklace
and then gasses you and your cousin...

13:15.920 --> 13:17.535
...all within a 24-hour period?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.875
I'd say he's got a thing for you.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.667
Well, when you're my editor,
l'll remember to care what you think.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.177
You know that whole
sugar-and-spice thing?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.474
Never really took with you, did it?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.006
Look...

13:30.185 --> 13:33.643
...Green Arrow, Green Eggs and Ham.
It doesn't matter what I call this guy.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.897
I'm gonna have his face plastered
all over the front page soon enough.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.775
Unless I'm missing something...

13:40.945 --> 13:44.278
...without that ring you're not as close
to ID'ing the guy as you claim.

13:44.449 --> 13:48.658
Yeah, that, well, I might've stretched
the truth just a little.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.495
Okay, well, you know,
it's a good thing that The Inquisitor...

13:52.665 --> 13:54.576
...doesn't pride itself on integrity.

13:57.462 --> 14:02.126
Listen, I don't like the idea of you dangling
yourself out as bait in front of this guy.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.586
Anyone after the Green Arrow
will come after you.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.218
Anyone after the Green Arrow
is a friend of mine...

14:07.388 --> 14:12.303
...and I'll be sitting front and center
with him when they lock this guy up.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.717
Wouldn't want you on myjury.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.429
Meaning?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.101
Well, you know, I thought...

14:23.279 --> 14:26.442
...we did away with the shoot-ﬁrst-ask-
questions-later mentality...

14:26.616 --> 14:28.732
...with covered wagons.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.612
Oh, come on, don't tell me you're
some kind of bleeding-heart paciﬁst?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.951
And that's worse
than a knee-jerk fascist?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.455
All right...

14:45.301 --> 14:47.917
...forget about this guy for the weekend.

14:48.680 --> 14:52.172
I can have you in Cancun
in time for the sunset tonight.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.968
Sipping margaritas, what do you say?

14:59.148 --> 15:02.982
Well, as much as I would love
to be your beach bimbo...

15:03.152 --> 15:06.736
...the only person I'm gonna spend
the weekend with is into leather...

15:06.906 --> 15:10.490
...and has a perverted fetish for archery.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.844
Well, they changed the gate
to the speedway.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.801
Yeah, and why is that?

15:33.975 --> 15:36.216
Well, that's the way it's engineered.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.975
Oh, I understand.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.807
-Thank you.
-All right.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.764
Clark, what a good surprise.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.603
What brings you up here?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.519
-Mom was pretty shaken up after the party.
-Yeah, I know.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.733
In spite of the
impromptu entertainment...

15:49.907 --> 15:53.365
...your mother made a terriﬁc impression
on some very inﬂuential people.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.323
-She wasn't the only one.
-Walk me to my car, will you?

15:56.497 --> 16:00.536
Don't worry, Clark, my security team
is making a very thorough investigation.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.575
Unlike the police.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.288
Why wouldn't you report something
that valuable if it was stolen?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.673
Well, I'd rather not let
the entire city know...

16:08.843 --> 16:11.585
...that I'm a sitting duck
for some acrobatic archer.

16:11.763 --> 16:15.551
It's not wise to advertise
our vulnerabilities, is it, Clark?

16:15.725 --> 16:19.013
We're talking about some
very expensive vulnerabilities.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.552
Oh, Fabergé egg.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.435
"Bishop's miter, 14th-century."
It's big stuff.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.647
Not the kind of stuff you ﬁnd
in your local pawnshop window.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.735
Here's something that might interest you
unless you've noticed.

16:33.910 --> 16:38.700
There's only one name on the SafeTex
client list that hasn't been hit already.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.866
I don't wanna be late. You ﬁnd it, huh?

18:30.651 --> 18:31.811
Who are you?

18:32.195 --> 18:33.981
Haven't you read?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.198
I'm the Green Arrow.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.526
Well, I hope you enjoyed your cult status
while it lasted.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.117
I think you're taking the whole
neighborhood-watch thing too seriously.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.378
-We got a breach. Secure all exits.
-Yes, sir.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.547
That was fun.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.808
Looks like I'm not the only one
with a secret.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.061
Hate to break it to you
but you're on the wrong side.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.348
I'm not sure the police would agree.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.353
Look around you, Beav.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.019
The days of the good guys
running the show are over.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.610
Good evening.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.331
Ms. Lang, what are you doing?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.303
Lionel Luthor knows about the black box.

20:21.470 --> 20:25.429
And he is willing to do anything
to get his hands on it.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.215
And you think I'm working with him?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.008
Not yet.

20:29.937 --> 20:34.522
But trust me, when he approaches you,
and he will...

20:34.692 --> 20:37.775
...Lionel is going to make you an offer
that is hard to resist.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.854
No matter what the bribe...

20:41.157 --> 20:44.820
...you will come to us before you
breathe a word to Lionel Luthor.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.788
With all due respect,
I work for Lex and not his girlfriend.

20:50.958 --> 20:55.668
I'm not interested
in your respect, Dr Groll.

20:56.464 --> 21:01.675
I'm much more interested
in your 14 years of employment here.

21:02.219 --> 21:06.087
Your two girls that are now
in prestigious prep schools.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.927
That new home that you just built
on Sparling Lane.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.765
You have a pretty wonderful life.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.599
Are you threatening me?

21:17.944 --> 21:21.061
Well, it just came to my attention
that if the government...

21:21.238 --> 21:25.857
...or your colleagues were to ﬁnd out that
you were secretly testing alien weapons...

21:26.619 --> 21:29.736
...this life that you have
worked so hard for...

21:30.122 --> 21:32.829
...may take an unfortunate turn.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.227
So how'd you let this guy
slip through your ﬁngers?

21:55.398 --> 21:58.231
This Green Arrow Bandit's
got a lot of gadgets.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.436
Gadgets?

21:59.610 --> 22:00.816
Against the man of steel?

22:01.821 --> 22:03.436
He's good, all right?

22:03.614 --> 22:06.105
Fine, backing off.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.784
"The Green Arrow Bandit"?

22:07.952 --> 22:10.659
Is that really the name
Lois came up with?

22:10.830 --> 22:14.197
If you ask me, I'd lose the "bandit,"
but not my story.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.993
With your competitive streak,
I'm surprised you forfeited this one to Lois.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.912
Competition? Lois?

22:21.090 --> 22:23.547
-l'm chalking this one up to pro bono.
-Yeah, right.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.091
Okay, so idle hands
aren't really my thing.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.719
I got the SafeTex report on the arrows.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.428
They're made from an advanced
titanium alloy that is untraceable.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.517
-What about the ring?
-None of the shots I scanned...

22:35.688 --> 22:37.519
...came out to have a clean image.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.189
However, I may have forgotten
to mention to Lois...

22:41.360 --> 22:44.978
...that my computer is compiling
them to render a new one.

22:51.162 --> 22:55.622
Look, you can tell the mailroom
to stop forwarding these bogus claims.

22:55.791 --> 22:59.625
Well, I highly doubt the Green Arrow
is going to out himself...

22:59.795 --> 23:01.251
...on a Hello Kitty notepad.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.583
Yeah. Thanks.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.146
Come here.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.730
-Lois, hey.
-Chloe!

23:29.909 --> 23:31.274
-Lois?
-Help.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.484
Please.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.493
Clark, she's in trouble.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.578
Lois?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.169
Looks like someone took her.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.130
Took her? What? Who would do that?

23:54.308 --> 23:55.673
Isn't it obvious?

23:55.851 --> 23:56.931
The Green Arrow.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.641
What makes you think
he'd have anything to do with this?

24:02.274 --> 24:05.357
He's wanted all over town
for armed robbery.

24:05.528 --> 24:09.237
Lois is the one who publicly threatened
to unmask the guy.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.943
Guess he doesn't live by a code of honor.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.069
Because it's not the same as yours?

24:17.540 --> 24:21.158
If you're as interested in ﬁnding out
about him as you are in catching him...

24:21.335 --> 24:25.499
...you'd realize that everything he's stolen
has been bought off the black market.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.459
-You saying Lionel's necklace is—?
-Yeah.

24:28.884 --> 24:31.045
That's exactly what I'm saying.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.550
You've been on this hunt
to return it to its original thief.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.432
You think Lionel took her?

24:38.894 --> 24:40.634
There's a lot of people that would...

24:40.813 --> 24:43.179
...go to any length
to catch the Green Arrow.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.367
I gotta go.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.421
Chloe, it's too late,
there's no sign of her.

25:09.592 --> 25:13.255
I might have something that will help.
The image from the ring ﬁnally rendered.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.590
And I'm sending it to you right now.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.430
It's a family crest. The only problem is,
ye olde crest makers weren't very creative.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.221
There's thousands of them
and they're all identical.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.391
It's gonna take me a little while
to track this one down.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.437
-I've seen this before.
-Clark?

25:34.491 --> 25:35.992
Hello?

25:37.203 --> 25:38.693
Hello?

26:45.521 --> 26:46.977
Tracking system enabled.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.439
Transmitting to BIackBeny.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.395
Tracking engaged.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.402
Tracking Safe Tex Security.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.824
Tracking system enabled.

26:57.992 --> 27:00.324
Tracking Safe Tex Security.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.993
-No. Let me go.
-Shut up.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.954
Get your hands off me.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.292
Let me go. Hey!

27:18.971 --> 27:20.632
What do you know about Green Arrow?

27:20.806 --> 27:24.219
I should've known he wouldn't have
the stones to face me in person.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.218
lib}

27:29.023 --> 27:30.308
lib}

27:36.905 --> 27:38.190
You know who he is.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.942
Give me a name.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.406
What did you see?

27:56.091 --> 27:58.343
-Who's the Green Arrow?
-Bandit.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.422
Green Arrow Bandit.
And like you don't know.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.213
That Errol-Flynn wannabe
put you guys up to this.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.133
That's enough.

28:12.775 --> 28:15.687
This "Bandit"...

28:15.861 --> 28:19.729
...has made a joke of the ﬁrm
I've worked my life to build.

28:20.115 --> 28:24.028
He's walked off
with more than 30 million from my clients.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.910
Then why am I the one with bruises
on my knees right now?

28:27.081 --> 28:30.414
Because you splashed my humiliation...

28:30.584 --> 28:33.291
...across the front page of the paper.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.919
And now you're gonna help me
rectify that.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.796
I don't know who he is.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.684
She doesn't know anything.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.861
Kill her.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.730
I didn't know blackmail
was one of your talents.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.403
Lex...

30:33.582 --> 30:36.745
...I know I went behind your back,
but I wanted to do this my way.

30:36.919 --> 30:39.877
-And if you're mad--
-Actually, I'm impressed.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.755
I've never had anyone...

30:50.933 --> 30:53.094
...try to protect me like that.

30:57.314 --> 31:00.056
Lex, we have a serious problem.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.020
Your father.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.732
He isn't gonna stop until he gets
that black box away from you.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.660
Because he's afraid of what I'll do.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.118
What about you?

31:14.373 --> 31:17.365
Is there a part of you
that wonders the same thing?

31:18.752 --> 31:20.253
No.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.249
I believe in you.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.295
But, Lex...

31:27.469 --> 31:31.257
...there is something that I haven't been
completely honest with you about.

31:36.311 --> 31:38.097
I knew the box was a weapon.

31:46.363 --> 31:49.025
If the box is that dangerous...

31:49.908 --> 31:53.025
...you want me to shut the project down,
don't you?

31:55.956 --> 31:57.662
No.

31:58.417 --> 32:02.786
Lex, it might be the only thing
that will save us from them next time.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.787
Are you okay?

32:41.168 --> 32:42.749
No thanks to you.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.587
-I saved you.
-Yeah.

32:51.762 --> 32:54.253
From goons who were trying to ﬁnd you.

32:54.431 --> 32:57.923
They're not the only one with a
V for Vendetta on your little leather ass.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.181
Little?

32:59.353 --> 33:01.218
I've been working the glutes lately too.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.136
Did the humor come with the costume?

33:03.315 --> 33:07.024
Did the Tomb Raider routine come
from wanting Daddy's attention?

33:12.991 --> 33:14.777
I guess my aim's a little rusty.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.491
Now...

33:18.246 --> 33:22.990
...let's take off those glasses and unveil
our prince of thieves, shall we?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.154
Oliver Queen.

33:54.783 --> 33:55.943
You owe me one.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.035
That was you on the roof?

34:07.504 --> 34:08.835
Why'd you let me get away?

34:12.008 --> 34:16.342
I'm not sure Lois would understand
why her new boyfriend leads a double life.

34:20.434 --> 34:23.141
Or why one of her best friends
does the same thing?

34:25.230 --> 34:26.640
I think we're even.

34:26.815 --> 34:30.148
We'll be even when you return
what you stole from Lionel.

34:50.505 --> 34:51.756
Chloe, what's all the buzz?

34:51.923 --> 34:54.505
Seven stolen artifacts were
anonymously returned...

34:54.676 --> 34:56.541
...to the Met, the Tate and the Louvre.

34:56.720 --> 35:00.087
Looks like you got some competition
in the knight-in-shining-armor arena.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.177
The guy does a couple good things
and goes from villain to hero?

35:03.351 --> 35:06.514
Clark, every time he strikes
some corrupt tycoon...

35:06.688 --> 35:09.600
...an anonymous donation to some charity
appears the next day.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.107
You don't care how many laws
are broken to get it?

35:12.277 --> 35:16.020
I guess that's the price of justice. If you
ask me, he's a modem-day Robin Hood.

35:16.198 --> 35:19.531
That still doesn't mean I'm not dying
to ﬁnd out who he is, though.

35:19.701 --> 35:23.569
Oh, hey, I never heard back from you
after I sent you the picture of that crest.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.033
I kind of ran into a dead end.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.084
That's funny, so did I.

35:32.506 --> 35:35.122
All my ﬁles on the ring are gone.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.708
Including the backup ﬁles. Clark?

35:39.679 --> 35:42.056
Just don't look into him, Chloe.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.093
You know who he is, don't you?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.392
As a favor to me, please don't.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.816
And he knows who you are.

35:57.113 --> 36:01.903
Well, I guess there's some sort of secret
code of honor among superheroes.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.160
What do we have here?

36:15.674 --> 36:16.663
Not bad for a rookie.

36:16.842 --> 36:21.586
Incredible. You have every newspaper in the
country calling this guy the Green Arrow.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.261
He's got a real following.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.513
Yeah, well, so did Charles Manson.

36:29.980 --> 36:34.349
I know this is a rare moment for you, but,
you know, maybe you're overreacting.

36:34.526 --> 36:38.690
-lt's not like this guy's a killer.
-Ollie, he's a threat to Metropolis...

36:38.864 --> 36:41.947
...and I'm not gonna stop
until I ﬁnd out who he is.

36:42.617 --> 36:46.109
Trust me. You don't know
the Green Arrow like I do.

37:04.222 --> 37:09.307
Not that I'd ever question
your theatrical skills...

37:10.145 --> 37:12.602
...but you really had Lana convinced.

37:14.482 --> 37:15.562
Thank you, Dad.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.308
Just following the script.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.477
The script that you gave me, son.

37:23.491 --> 37:27.450
But, you know, if you really want to have
a honest relationship with Lana...

37:27.621 --> 37:29.327
...you should stop testing her.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.491
Well, I had to be sure.

37:36.421 --> 37:39.504
Another important lesson you taught me:

37:40.050 --> 37:43.508
"The greater the trust,
the greater the betrayal."

37:47.349 --> 37:51.843
All right, Lex, what do I have to do to prove
to you that I wanna be a part of your life?

37:53.605 --> 37:56.597
Part of my life or part of the project?

37:57.692 --> 38:01.651
I would never have told you about the box
if you hadn't already known.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.487
But that's as close
as you're ever gonna get to it.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.829
So, what makes you think
that I won't tell Lana Lang...

38:17.003 --> 38:21.838
...about the obstacle course you set up
for her, if I'm so untrustworthy?

38:25.845 --> 38:31.181
Because you've put so much effort into
fooling the Kents that you're a good man...

38:31.768 --> 38:34.054
...you're starting to believe it yourself.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.909
I didn't realize
I was such a fascinating subject.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.916
You've been reading up on me.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.047
You and Lois ought to start a fan club.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.927
Are you gonna tell her?

39:11.516 --> 39:15.054
I don't know, Clark. You seem to be doing
a pretty good job skating by...

39:15.228 --> 39:16.889
...with this farm-boy charade.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.893
You can't be with someone
unless they know who you really are.

39:21.484 --> 39:22.940
Trust me, I've tried.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.106
You lost her to Lex.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.525
Is that why you hate me, Clark?

39:32.078 --> 39:35.411
Because I'm just another silver-spoon-fed
rich boy, is that it?

39:37.792 --> 39:40.408
Or is it because I won't play
the martyr like you?

39:40.587 --> 39:43.329
You can play this game
as long as you want.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.294
But sooner or later you're gonna hurt her.

39:47.010 --> 39:47.999
You know that.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.462
Well, you seem to have all the answers.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.132
So I guess it's a good thing I've decided
to put this into safer hands.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.484
For the record, Lionel bought that
off a notorious Bosnian warlord...

40:06.654 --> 40:08.485
...used it to launder LuthorCorp money.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.612
So why give it to me?

40:13.870 --> 40:17.863
Well, you seem to have a crystal-clear idea
of what's right and what's wrong.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.948
You decide who it belongs to.

40:23.505 --> 40:25.962
It's not as clear as it used to be.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.801
You really think it's right to steal
as long as it goes to a good cause?

40:32.013 --> 40:34.675
That the end justiﬁes the means?

40:35.350 --> 40:37.136
Absolutely, yes.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.889
I'll never feel that way.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.318
You said you didn't owe me one.

40:49.489 --> 40:50.854
So why are you really here?

40:53.284 --> 40:57.744
Clark, you have abilities
I couldn't even dream of.

40:59.624 --> 41:03.367
And I admire that you use them
to save the people you're close to.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.410
But...?

41:06.089 --> 41:09.206
But there's a whole world
of people out there, Clark.

41:09.384 --> 41:10.874
They need us.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.387
With your potential...

41:18.393 --> 41:21.100
...you can't wait for them
to come to you.

41:25.608 --> 41:28.224
When you're ready
to do something about that...

41:30.280 --> 41:32.111
...you let me know.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.607
