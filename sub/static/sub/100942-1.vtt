00:22.648 --> 00:28.268
Grace! Grace! Grace!
Grace! Grace! Grace!

00:28.362 --> 00:31.195
Grace! Grace! Grace!

01:05.524 --> 01:07.856
Do you guys like this song?

01:12.823 --> 01:15.439
Whoa, whoa. We're clipping.
Let's pull that down.

01:15.534 --> 01:16.534
Got it.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.862
Do you guys like this song?

01:21.957 --> 01:25.666
'Cause I've been singing it
for a long time.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.165
This was one of the first songs
I ever recorded.

01:29.256 --> 01:33.374
Lee Moses wrote it. And when I played it
for the label, they said,

01:33.468 --> 01:35.459
"who wants fo listen fo this?"

01:36.305 --> 01:37.886
And you know what I say?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.926
"How you like me now?”

01:41.018 --> 01:42.554
Wait, wait. Play that back.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.706
Let's lose the gates.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.530
I want it to bleed more.

01:47.024 --> 01:49.390
And you know what I say?

01:49.484 --> 01:52.271
"How you like me now?"

01:52.362 --> 01:53.772
Nice, Maggie.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.568
This song is about...

01:59.077 --> 02:00.863
- A bad girl.
- "A bad girl."

02:00.954 --> 02:03.036
One, two, three, four!

02:04.207 --> 02:08.746
J» bad girl

02:12.924 --> 02:14.710
Sorry, Maggie,
I got a real session here.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.801
Oh, shit.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.090
- That's crazy.
- Crazy!

02:19.181 --> 02:20.181
Hey, sweetie.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.505
- Sethy! My brother.
- Hey.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.870
You beautiful beast.
What's happening? Looking good as usual.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.288
Dude, was that
a grace Davis track?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.222
It's a work in progress.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.540
Yeah,
I'd love to get in on that.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.428
Yeah, me too.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.479
Let me just pull up your track.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.520

03:33.547 --> 03:34.878
hi.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.549
Where are her keys?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.966
You could lose the tone.
I've had a hell of a day.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.168
Where are the keys?

03:41.263 --> 03:42.628
Mm-mmm.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.760
I manage the house,
not the woman that lives inside of it.

03:45.851 --> 03:46.851
That's your job.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.574
If your ass can't be on time,
be early.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.568
Here, this is her bag.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.493
Hey, I'll see you at the house.

04:14.838 --> 04:15.953
Late.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.255
Six minutes.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.173
- Not my best.
- Nope.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.421
How was Maui?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.628
Crowded, hot, pretty, fun.
I don't know, hard.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.930
What is this? That's disgusting.
I don't want that.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.017
Why'd you bring that?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.307
You asked me to.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.851
You drink it.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.274
Your set-changes meeting is at 2:30,
and then you have the waxer at 3:15.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.880
- And you want a facial, yeah?
- Yeah. I don't want this though.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.236
No more of that. My god.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.484
The band is coming over
for the party at five-ish,

04:43.575 --> 04:46.032
and tomorrow we leave at 9:30,
wheels up, for New York.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.972
And what are we doing
with that producer meeting?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.702
Jack is scheduling those.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.247
But about the live album,
I was wondering...

04:52.334 --> 04:55.076
Do I have rehearsal tomorrow?
Is that all set?

04:55.170 --> 04:59.163
Yes. Well, Dan was asking

04:59.257 --> 05:02.715
if perhaps you would wanna rehearse
at his house instead of yours?

05:06.890 --> 05:10.098
I'd said to his assistant that
that probably would not...

05:10.185 --> 05:11.971
How many grammys do I have?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.222
- Eleven.
- Uh-huh.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.554
And how many grammys
does Dan have?

05:15.649 --> 05:16.855
- Eight.
- Not eleven.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.058
- No.
- That's eight. That's very fewer than me.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.517
- Mm-hmm.
- A lot fewer.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.482
You feel free to relay that
to his assistant.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.745
Oh. Thank you.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.045
Look at you, full of sugar.

05:44.135 --> 05:44.965
Shit.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.044
Just eat half of your ass.

05:47.138 --> 05:50.471
I'MMA just eat cake, no icing.
No icing.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.641
Jack, she will have
just finished eight shows,

05:52.727 --> 05:54.388
and you want her to fly to Vegas

05:54.479 --> 05:56.811
to have a conversation
with the Caesars Palace guy?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.889
It's a residency, okay?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.975
And it's my job
to find us our next gig.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.980
This ain't
your grandmama's Vegas.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.108
Lil Jon done played there.
Dj khaled.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.440
Let me do my job, and you do yours,

06:08.535 --> 06:13.279
which is get her coffee,
kleenex, kotex,

06:13.373 --> 06:16.661
and whatever else the hell we been
paying you to do for the last six months.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.582
Three years.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.160
I've been here for three years.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.335
You get paid?

06:21.423 --> 06:23.004
I thought you were an intern.

06:23.091 --> 06:27.960
Jack, I just feel like it might be
a good idea if she took a break.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.339
That's a good idea.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.342
And what I mean by "good idea"...

06:32.017 --> 06:33.848
Screw you and your shitty ideas.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.721
She just got back from Hawaii.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.812
That was work.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.228
Yeah, in Hawaii.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.727
Okay, now, guys,
I'm not going back to Hawaii.

06:40.817 --> 06:45.231
If we're gonna do tropical,
Jack, I want to go to the Maldives.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.858
Jack,

06:46.948 --> 06:49.985
there hasn't been
a new grace Davis record in a decade,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.032
and the fans want one.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.326
We need one.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.619
Let me tell you something.

06:54.706 --> 06:58.073
I've been managing grace
longer than you've probably been alive.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.951
So, you think she should do
new material?

07:01.046 --> 07:03.037
- Yeah.
- Okay. Guess what.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.965
Don't nobody give a shit
about new material. Okay?

07:07.052 --> 07:10.715
That last album she did,
it didn't do as well as she had hoped.

07:12.015 --> 07:16.850
Matter of fact, those was not
grace Davis numbers, and you know it.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.019
That was a reality check,

07:19.105 --> 07:21.312
people letting us know
it's time to move on.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.606
- To a Vegas residency?
- Yeah!

07:23.693 --> 07:26.935
Don't nobody wanna go to no
yankee-doodle Springsteen concert

07:27.030 --> 07:29.817
and hear him play
that wrecking ball folksy bullshit.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.274
Actually, that was
an incredibly poignant album,

07:32.369 --> 07:34.325
and it did extremely well.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.199
People want "thunder road," okay?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.643
And that's what we gonna give 'em.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.953
We gonna give 'em "thunder road."

07:41.044 --> 07:42.875
That's how I pay my mortgage.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.803
But you wouldn't know that 'cause
your little ass ain't got no mortgage.

07:46.049 --> 07:49.132
Crazy little girl gonna tell me
how to do my goddamn job.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.961
Always coming in
with some Springsteen shit.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.219
Got me twisted.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.140
> It's an evil wind >

08:07.570 --> 08:09.401
"share your love with me,"

08:09.489 --> 08:12.322
sung by the 27-year-old aretha frankiin.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.489

08:13.576 --> 08:14.611

- Headphones.
- Okay.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.691
You put them on so I can sleep.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.449

09:19.601 --> 09:22.092
This is the song list
for the live album.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.973
- Okay.
- Don't mess it up.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.349
- I won't.
- Okay.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.625
- Here you go.
- Thank you, baby.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.981
I know that Jack is setting

09:29.069 --> 09:31.185
some producer meetings
for the live album,

09:31.279 --> 09:32.394
and I was wondering...

09:32.489 --> 09:34.354
Well, I was hoping,
actually, if I could...

09:34.449 --> 09:36.761
What you doing in my damn seat?
Why you always sitting here?

09:36.785 --> 09:37.991
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.527
Sorry.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.660
Wanna go over the set list?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.752
No. Do you?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.091
No.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.635
I got your bag of diabetes right here.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.587
Boom. Give it to me.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.910
You know,
I don't even like sugar.

10:00.934 --> 10:01.934
Uh-huh.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.976
I only carry this on the off-chance
that you might want some, you know?

10:05.063 --> 10:08.180
- Mm-hmm. Very kind.
- But you know who ends up eating it all?

10:08.274 --> 10:11.391
- Who?
- Me. And I'm trying to do better.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.521
Uh-huh.

10:12.904 --> 10:15.190
Taking my little pilates...

10:15.281 --> 10:19.274
Got my spin classes,
eating my salads.

10:20.703 --> 10:24.992
Iceberg lettuce with a whole bunch
of blue cheese on it is not a salad.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.917
Look, the menu say it's a salad,
it's a goddamn salad.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.368
It's not a salad. Yeah.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.245
- Mm.
- So let's go over the list.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.955
No, I don't wanna go over the set list.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.415
Grace, come on.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.113
I'll get off this goddamn plane
right now.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.949
You're gonna get off the plane, Jack?
How are you gonna get off the plane?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.588
- I bought you the plane.
- You...

10:41.683 --> 10:42.763
Oh.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.392
My voice bought me this plane.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.061
That's a damn technicality.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.389
Give me another red vine.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.395
- Know what? 20% of that's mine.
- Unbelievable.

I can't hear you, Maggie.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.429

- Detroit free press:

12:20.949 --> 12:23.691
"Everything we'd expect
from a grace Davis concert.

12:23.785 --> 12:27.277
Lucky her songs are good,
or by now we would have tired of them."

12:28.414 --> 12:29.950
- I need more ice.
- I don't agree.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.281
I know when I need more ice.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.368
J» baby, 'cause you >

12:34.462 --> 12:36.874
j» you got little brittle pieces... »

12:36.965 --> 12:38.330
it's whatever come first.

12:40.009 --> 12:47.388
J» stop for a minute
stop for a minute, oh »

12:48.476 --> 12:50.262
thank you!

12:54.315 --> 12:55.680
I call tall blondie.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.561
- Dark shorty.
- I call Mr. chocolate.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.267
- Grace!
- Yes, Jack.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.215
Look. Hey, y'all,
get the hell outta here. Leave.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.524
Oh, and hello to you too.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.025
- Give me that.
- Give me that.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.191
- Remember Alec? Caesars Palace.
- Oh!

13:07.287 --> 13:08.572
Of course I do.

13:08.663 --> 13:12.281
I wish I'd known you were coming.
I would've gotten you box seats.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.865
There's no need to fret.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.450
Jack got me "the hookup."

13:16.546 --> 13:18.002
I can't tell you how stoked I am

13:18.089 --> 13:19.984
to be here and finally be
having this conversation.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.999
We so wanna be
in the you business, grace.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.129
Caesars is going through
a full revamp.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.427
More seats, brighter lights,
louder sound.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.550
It looked great in there.
It's hooked.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.257
And everything you're doing on tour,
we can do it right there.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.263
- Yeah.
- Five years, six years...

13:33.354 --> 13:35.727
Ten.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.521
I would do the same thing
every night?

13:37.608 --> 13:39.644
Man, that's my dream job.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.227
Easy money.
Look, no stress, all right?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.357
No more touring.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.608
I love touring.

13:44.699 --> 13:45.843
I like groupies too.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.698
No, I like touring.
I don't like groupies.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.615
But this way,

13:48.703 --> 13:52.696
this way I ain't got to
reinvent your ass every time.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.031
I'm just trying to take
a little pressure off myself.

13:55.126 --> 13:58.618
I found your lucky glass.
It was on the balcony, which was weird.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.858
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Sweetheart, be an angel,

14:00.882 --> 14:02.372
- get me a drink. No soda.
- Get.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.083
Celine Dion did
over a thousand shows for us.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.420
But I think with your fan base,
we can beat that record.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.680
Man, come on.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.370
- That's nothing.
- That's nothing.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.850
It's "Nathan."

14:14.937 --> 14:16.268
It's... "Nathan."

14:16.356 --> 14:18.472
If you want the feel of touring,
we can do it.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.648
We'll leave from Vegas,
we'll drive you around,

14:20.735 --> 14:22.296
we'll come back to Vegas.
You'll feel like you're touring.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.339
We'll do whatever you want.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.445
Grace, there's a problem
with the house monitor,

14:25.531 --> 14:27.317
so we just need to do
another sound check.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.648
Oh, my god. Okay. So sorry.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.449
- Duty calls. Gotta go.
- Of course, yeah.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.447
We'll do anything
to get you there. So...

14:32.538 --> 14:34.574
Thank you for coming.
Enjoy the show.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.801
Hey.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.892
Are you okay?

14:53.976 --> 14:55.716
Yeah. I can't sleep.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.181
Do you want some tea?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.604
Or I think Jack has a lot of Ambien.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.522
No. It's fine. Stop. Relax.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.727
What are you doing?

15:06.447 --> 15:07.482
Schedule stuff.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.402
What are you listening to?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.281
Oh.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.707
Such a good song.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.626
Maxine brown.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.042
You know
who originally wrote this?

15:25.133 --> 15:26.293
Yeah. Carole king.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.214
Very good.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.791
She's my favorite songwriter.

15:28.886 --> 15:29.966
Really?

15:30.054 --> 15:31.054
Other than you.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.097
Thank you.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.140
I'm sorry.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.964
I'm joking.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.059
Here.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.769
That was a really good move back there
with Mr. Vegas.

15:41.566 --> 15:45.150
It did not look like
you wanted to have that conversation.

15:45.236 --> 15:48.228
Oh. Like you can read me so well.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.279
Sorry.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.572
I'm kidding.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.066
I can't believe he pulled that.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.618
He's just looking out for me.

15:55.705 --> 15:59.323
He and I have been hustling together
since I was...

16:00.501 --> 16:02.082
Since I was 18.

16:02.170 --> 16:08.291
I used to do these sets
at these late-night divey piano bars.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.627
They were, like, sticky floors,
like, smoke everywhere.

16:12.722 --> 16:16.055
Sound system was terrible.
They were awful. Like, awful.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.724
And every night, Jack would...

16:19.353 --> 16:21.810
He would show up
and he'd be standing in the back...

16:23.733 --> 16:26.645
And his mouth was just, like,
hanging open, looking at me.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.526
For where we come from...

16:31.407 --> 16:33.944
Getting locked into a Vegas residency...

16:35.036 --> 16:38.244
That is a win.

16:38.998 --> 16:39.998
What?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.209
Nothing.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.120
I know everyone is happy with me...

16:49.842 --> 16:52.254
Doing the same show every night.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.461
I don't know, what if...

16:56.766 --> 16:57.766
Whatever.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.843
I remember watching you on Oprah...
Which time?

17:01.938 --> 17:04.349
- When I was little.
- I've done Oprah so many times.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.601
I think you were talking about
your third album.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.102
Mm-hmm.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.685
And you said this thing
that I'll never forget.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.191
I think about it all the time.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.528
You said, "when there are
no more surprises,

17:16.618 --> 17:18.358
then who am I doing it for?"

17:20.080 --> 17:21.195
Oprah.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.114
Oprah.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.493
Long time ago.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.700
Mm-hmm.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.830
So, has this just been,
like, a long con?

17:27.922 --> 17:28.786
Yes.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.042
Ever since I was a little girl,

17:31.133 --> 17:34.625
I've dreamed of giving you
an enema in Toronto.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.756
Okay. Do not bring up Toronto.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.367
You know what clams do to me.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.430
She was telling me about
all these amazing affairs that she had.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.732
So you didn't talk to her
about the album.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.355
No. You don't understand.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.048
- Katie, she doesn't have any family...
- "She doesn't have any family...

17:53.072 --> 17:54.216
- And no friends.
- And no friends."

17:54.240 --> 17:55.855
You're not friends. We are friends.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.565
You know how I know we're friends?

17:57.660 --> 18:00.652
Because friends don't pay friends
to be their friends.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.740
I actually feel like I pay for
a lot of stuff in this relationship.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.291
This is like a trap, you know?

18:08.004 --> 18:11.212
You are not the only person
in the world for her.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.631
You are my only person
in my world.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.718
I know that.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.044
But if you told 12-year-old me that
one day I'd be working for grace Davis?

18:18.139 --> 18:19.845
I mean, she's an icon.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.285
It's the dream job.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.925
Or at least it's, like, the gateway
to my actual dream job.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.386
It's the gateway to, like,
Stockholm syndrome.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.096
Hey, I thought
you left your phone in the car.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.421
Yeah, I left my phone in the car.
This is my work phone.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.356
Okay. You know what?
Listen to me, Maggie.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.108
- Yes.
- Phone down. Eyes on me.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.782
I know you think that she's gonna
give you this, like, life-changing shot,

18:39.869 --> 18:41.709
and you guys are gonna
ride off into the sunset

18:41.787 --> 18:43.152
holding hands or some shit,

18:43.247 --> 18:46.455
but I think we need to consider
the possibility

18:46.542 --> 18:48.658
that this woman doesn't even know
your last name.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.584
She does, sometimes.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.734
Do we really think she's gonna stop
making you wear her shoes around the house

18:53.758 --> 18:56.921
to break them in, and, oh, I don't know,
make you her producer?

18:57.011 --> 18:58.342
Yes!

18:58.429 --> 18:59.429
Maggie!

18:59.513 --> 19:01.658
She only did that once, by the way,
and it was for the grammys.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.513
Can you please want more
for yourself?

19:04.268 --> 19:06.725
We are like this.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.348
So when you say "affairs"...

19:08.439 --> 19:09.708
I'm not gonna
tell you anything...

19:09.732 --> 19:11.960
- Give me a name. One name.
- Because grace and I are friends

19:11.984 --> 19:13.099
and I signed an nda.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.989

But yes.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.457
Great song.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.629
You don't think so?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720

19:53.693 --> 19:56.309

19:56.404 --> 19:57.610
Yeah, phantom planet.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.028
Very good.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.948
Well, everybody knows this song.
It's from the o.C.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.114
Great show, right?

20:05.788 --> 20:06.788
I have to go.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.230
I'm just wondering
if your distaste for the show

20:13.254 --> 20:17.088
is affecting your ability to appreciate
the musical complexity of the song.

20:19.885 --> 20:24.174
Well, of all the songs about California,
this is not the one that I would pick.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.095
Okay.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.535
Joni Mitchell's "California," maybe.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.301
Or "going back to Cali"
or "California dreamin'."

20:29.395 --> 20:30.497
They're all way better than this.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.432
"California love." Yeah.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.309
Zeppelin's "going to California.”

20:34.400 --> 20:35.560
That's an amazing song.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.516
Okay. "Hotel California."

20:38.404 --> 20:39.564
Uh...

20:39.655 --> 20:40.841
What's wrong with "hotel California"?

20:40.865 --> 20:42.150
Well, the eagles are hokey.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.028
And Don henley is a very mean man.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.576
Randy meisner almost died
of a stomach ulcer

20:47.663 --> 20:49.654
because the band
hated each other so much.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.331
Yeah, but it's a perfect song.
It's underrated, to be honest.

20:52.418 --> 20:53.828
Underrated? Yeah.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.409
It's literally always on.

20:55.504 --> 20:58.712
It's, like, the "brown eyed girl"
of Southern California soft rock.

20:58.799 --> 21:02.007
So the eagles won't make
your fantasy dinner party. Who does?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.585
- Popsicle?
- No, thanks.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.551
Well, living or dead?

21:08.184 --> 21:09.674
It doesn't matter.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.475
Um, Brian Wilson.

21:11.896 --> 21:12.896
Mm-hmm.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.561
Nina Simone.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.138
She and I have the same birthday.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.598
Me and Mariah Carey.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.776
So we're both very demanding
and very deeply sad.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.603
Yeah.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.438
Otis Redding for sure.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.636
You're not one of those girls
who learned about Otis Redding

21:26.660 --> 21:28.525
from the dirty dancing soundtrack,
are you?

21:28.621 --> 21:30.015
I'm not even
going to respond to that.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.575
- So yes. Last one.
- Hi.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.621
- Hi.
- Sam Cooke.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.370
Who's Sam Cooke?

21:35.461 --> 21:36.496
"Who's Sam Cooke"?

21:36.587 --> 21:38.168
Yeah, who's Sam Cooke?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.587
You know phantom planet,
but you don't know Sam Cooke?

21:40.674 --> 21:42.778
Folks, please join us outside on the patio

21:42.802 --> 21:44.667
for live music and free vitamin-b shols.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.047
I'm having a party next week.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.670
You should come.

21:47.765 --> 21:50.131
- Oh, uh...
- That'll be 45.17.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.682
For the popsicles.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.511
Welcome to the second annual
Laurel canyon wellness fest.

21:55.606 --> 21:59.474
I'm David cliff, and I'm going to start
off with a song from the king of soul,

21:59.568 --> 22:00.808
Sam Cooke.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.270
Hope you all know who that is.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.012
son of a bitch.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.179
Qd you thrill me >

22:32.184 --> 22:33.970
/f's just one simple meeting.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.599
The label guys want to know
all about Vegas.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.526
You know what?
Let's just talk about this later.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.525
Continue to do
your euca-load of shit.

22:52.246 --> 22:56.785
"I don't want to sit
with a bunch of label guys who..."

22:58.210 --> 22:59.245
What is that line?

22:59.336 --> 23:00.746
"Have to be reminded.”

23:00.838 --> 23:04.626
"Have to be reminded
that I'm still alive."

23:04.717 --> 23:06.708
What did we sit here
and talk about?

23:10.472 --> 23:14.636
"I've already done a greatest hits album
and a live album,

23:14.727 --> 23:17.844
and now a greatest hits live aloum?"

23:18.522 --> 23:19.932
What?

23:20.024 --> 23:24.188
Look, when I agreed to come back,
what did you promise me?

23:24.945 --> 23:26.060
Huh?

23:26.155 --> 23:28.646
You said you was gonna
listen to me this time.

23:29.158 --> 23:33.197
All I want to do is play it safe
so we can stack some money.

23:33.287 --> 23:34.367
It's pathetic.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.911
No, you pathetic

23:35.998 --> 23:39.081
'cause you arguing with me,
and your ass should be on vocal rest.

23:39.168 --> 23:43.662
I will decide
what I want to do next.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.747
- Yes.
- Give me the popsicles, Maggie.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.250
You always walk away!

23:50.054 --> 23:53.137
Grace, now ain't the time
for some damn sabbatical.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.504
Oh, shit.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.335
What is Richie doing here?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.716
He been working on this shit,
like, two weeks, okay?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.844
So look. I haven't heard it either.

24:37.935 --> 24:41.393
So before you start complaining,
at least give the man a listen.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.679
- Hi.
- Richie Williams.

24:43.774 --> 24:46.265
- R-dub, that's what they call me.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.272
I feel like we met
at the met ball or Oscar awards?

24:49.363 --> 24:50.853
Or a rave? You ever go to raves?

24:50.948 --> 24:52.654
Don't go to raves, Richie.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.135
We're gonna go to one
with this remix.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.220
Let me show you

24:55.244 --> 24:57.735
Richie Williams' version of "bad girl."

24:58.455 --> 25:00.787
Mm-hmm.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.084
Yeah.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.837
> Bad girl... »

25:07.923 --> 25:09.629
signature sound right there.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.717
Yup.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.716
Is that dope or is that dope?

25:17.808 --> 25:19.093
Trick question. This is dope.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.264
- Gotcha.
- We know that.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.717
I mean, all of it.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.222
What are you doing here, Maggie?

25:23.313 --> 25:24.348
Um...

25:24.440 --> 25:27.227
Richie Williams. R-dubs.
Grammy award winner.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.557
I'm working on the album.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.047
If you wanna sit in the session,
I can mentor you a little bit.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.966
It's important for me
to raise women up, you know?

25:32.990 --> 25:34.467
- Come on in here, sweetheart.
- Come on, man.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.856
We ain't got time for that, okay?

25:35.951 --> 25:36.781
Let's get back into it.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.471
Let's focus on this.
Don't worry about her.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.656
The album kinda feels done.
Let's talk about it.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.581
This version of "bad girl,"
the old one's kinda old, right?

25:43.667 --> 25:44.667
Feels old or whatever.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.913
I feel like this one spiced it up
a little bit.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.004
Feels global now.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.544
Global. All right?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.917
Matter of fact, intergalactical.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.374
Intergalactical.

25:53.469 --> 25:54.738
That's that edm stuff, man.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.718
Grace, may I please speak with you
for a moment?

25:57.389 --> 26:00.051
- What?
- Well, I just wanted to...

26:00.142 --> 26:01.052
Oh, my god. Spit it out.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.225
I did a cut of the album.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.146
I did a cut.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.721
Seth helped me.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.434
You hadn't hired anybody to do it yet,
and I didn't want to tell you or Jack.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.408
Hey, hey. We can hear yall.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.741
Y'all know it's a damn microphone
in there, right?

26:16.784 --> 26:18.053
How long have you
been working on this?

26:18.077 --> 26:21.114
I came in before work and after work,
and whenever I could.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.320
I should have asked you.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.324
Yeah.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.700
I just wanted to take a shot.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.371
Do you want to hear it?

26:28.462 --> 26:29.702
- Okay.
- Hell no!

26:30.506 --> 26:33.248
This is the spine of the song.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.653
You're always talking about
how there has to be a heartbeat,

26:35.677 --> 26:38.510
something to hold on to
and then give away.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.712
And this is it.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.827
Hanky's been playing this drum track
for 20 years,

26:42.851 --> 26:46.264
and it still sounds as tight as it did
on the day you recorded it.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.765
- Richard.
- "R-dawg."

26:47.856 --> 26:49.346
Did you redo this with a synth?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.306
It's actually called cross synthesis,

26:51.401 --> 26:54.188
which I invented, which takes one synth
and cancels the other out

26:54.279 --> 26:56.486
when they play at the same time.
Sounds dope.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.813
That doesn't make any sense.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.511
- Yeah, it does.
- It does.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.012
You've heard
of cross synthesis, right?

27:01.036 --> 27:03.118
No, but it don't matter.
You the producer.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.321
- Yeah.
- You took out the backup singers?

27:05.415 --> 27:07.143
They're kinda old-sounding.
I mean, honestly.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.703
We got plug-ins that do that stuff.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.794
Ah.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.022
We don't even need
backup singers anymore.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.232
>» bad girl »

27:12.256 --> 27:14.576
I put my voice in there and stacked it,
put some auto-tune,

27:14.633 --> 27:16.123
it sounds brand-new. Sounds great.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.300
Grace, do you hear this?

27:18.387 --> 27:19.467
J» bad girl »

27:19.555 --> 27:20.795
you are the song.

27:20.889 --> 27:24.222
You should not be buried under
all this flashy bullshit.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.012
Sure, the track needs some mixing
and some editing,

27:27.104 --> 27:29.470
but you could release your demos

27:29.565 --> 27:33.979
and they would be way better than anything
that he's ever, ever done.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.354
Yeah, right.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.048
I actually think you should
release your demos,

27:37.072 --> 27:38.925
because I've heard them
and they're unbelievable.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.406
Who the hell you think you are,
missy Elliott?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.613
Who releases demos?

27:42.661 --> 27:45.152
How you gonna come in here
and insult my man Richie?

27:45.247 --> 27:46.391
- Go to Starbucks!
- Okay, okay.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.951
Everybody, stop.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.872
9 he doesn't care »

27:51.420 --> 27:54.628
Margaret, never talk to anyone
that Jack has hired that way again,

27:54.715 --> 27:56.046
do you understand?

27:56.133 --> 27:57.133
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.217
Yes.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.712
- Never.
- Never.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.378
We got a hit. We got a big one.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.994
- It's a hit.
- My version, not hers.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.883
Don't worry about hers, man.

28:07.978 --> 28:08.978
Oh, I'm not.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.123
See what I'm dealing with here?

28:10.147 --> 28:11.416
- She was kinda mean.
- She is very abrasive.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.270
Use her cut.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.143
- What?
- Wh...

28:15.319 --> 28:17.519
I'm still getting paid, right?

28:19.698 --> 28:20.698
Maggie.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.283
Maggie.

28:22.784 --> 28:23.784
Come here.

28:25.412 --> 28:29.997
I don't know what planet you come from
where rattling off every little opinion

28:30.083 --> 28:33.575
that's rolling around in that brain
of yours is considered a skill.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.628
But... I was right.

28:36.715 --> 28:41.300
This is not about being right
in the studio for a moment in time.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.796
This is a marathon.

28:42.888 --> 28:43.888
I'm sorry, I disagree.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.305
I think if she put out
something like that, oh, my god.

28:48.268 --> 28:52.307
Obviously... we would never
put out garbage like that.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.723
But that's besides the point.

28:55.817 --> 28:59.776
It took me months
to get them in a studio together.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.656
Months.

29:01.740 --> 29:06.530
Off the off-chance she might say,
"hey, Jack. I want to do a remix album."

29:07.162 --> 29:09.403
And I say, "I got the perfect person.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.454
Oh, damn.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.497
We can't work with him anymore,

29:13.585 --> 29:18.295
because your dumb-ass assistant
insulted the man,

29:18.382 --> 29:20.168
and he don't wanna work
with you no more.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.341
He'd rather do Rihanna."

29:24.888 --> 29:26.173
Well, I...

29:26.265 --> 29:28.677
I apologize for that.

29:31.144 --> 29:35.137
And now that I'm the producer,
I will look for my replacement.

29:35.607 --> 29:42.024
Do you know how long it took for Seth
to get a little bitty engineering credit?

29:43.031 --> 29:47.491
Being a producer
is about having a point of view

29:47.577 --> 29:51.786
that you've earned
over years of hard work.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.613
It don't happen like this.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.415
You are not a producer.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.413
You're not an artist.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.869
You're not a manager.

29:59.548 --> 30:05.009
If you wanna be a producer,
you find your own goddamn clients

30:05.595 --> 30:07.381
and stay the hell out of mine.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.387
This is what we're gonna do.

30:29.411 --> 30:30.742
We're gonna go in there... yes.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.413
Then we're gonna get some drinks
and then we are going to find him.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.579
I'll give him the spiel,

30:35.667 --> 30:37.353
and then we're just gonna leave
as quickly as possible.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.813
No, we don't have to leave
so quickly.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.418
We're having fun.
We're hanging out.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.108
When was the last time
you went to a party?

30:42.132 --> 30:43.167
Do work parties count?

30:43.258 --> 30:44.122
No.

30:44.217 --> 30:47.129
I went, technically,
to Elton John's Oscar party.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.836
That doesn't count.
You stood outside the entire time.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.137
Whoa, he has a pool?

30:51.224 --> 30:52.224
Whoo!

30:52.309 --> 30:55.301
Do any of them have jobs?

30:56.146 --> 30:57.761
Hi. Excuse me. Do you have a job?

30:57.856 --> 30:58.686
I'm a model.

30:58.774 --> 30:59.774
Okay.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.689
It's a Wednesday.

31:01.777 --> 31:02.837
I didn't think
you'd ever wear it.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.147
What is... oh, my god.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.775
Wait, I thought you said
he performed at a grocery store,

31:07.866 --> 31:09.402
not that he owned it.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.324
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm coming.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.526
Yeah, I'm ready.

31:12.621 --> 31:13.973
My drink.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.908
- Oh!
- Oh, my god. Is it bad?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.739
Oh, my...

31:17.834 --> 31:19.449
Ugh. This is so crazy.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.660
I know.
Why does he have a blow-dryer?

31:22.839 --> 31:24.295
I don't even know him.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.045
"Hey, man from last week.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.002
I just want you
to remind yourself of me,

31:30.097 --> 31:32.759
and I would like to tell you
that I'm just a personal assistant,

31:32.849 --> 31:34.385
but I'd love to produce your music

31:34.476 --> 31:36.216
- if you got any.”
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.724
Look, all I do is basically clean up
biohazardous materials,

31:39.815 --> 31:42.272
but I get to walk around
and call myself a doctor.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.439
That's not all you do.

31:43.527 --> 31:46.064
Exactly.
Do not sell yourself short.

31:46.154 --> 31:50.989
You just produced a live grace Davis album
for no money and no credit.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.907
And you're gonna do it again.
You know why?

31:52.994 --> 31:54.305
Because you're following your dream.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.307
No, that's not my dream.
I don't wanna do that again.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.946
I'd love to get money and credit.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.327
God, he has so many products.
Ooh.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.523
Feels like we shouldn't go through his
stuff yet 'cause we don't even know him!

32:03.547 --> 32:05.128
Well, I've done it, and here we are.

32:05.215 --> 32:06.609
Look, you need to
pull yourself together

32:06.633 --> 32:08.874
and tell your vision-impaired,
fresh-breathed client

32:08.969 --> 32:10.709
that you are a producer.

32:11.721 --> 32:12.961
I am not a...

32:13.515 --> 32:15.346
You are so lucky, Maggie.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.971
So you get out there,
and you close that deal.

32:18.061 --> 32:18.971
Okay.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.622
You're way too comfortable
in his house.

32:20.689 --> 32:21.833
- You are.
- I am not.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.167
- Hello.
- Oh, that's you.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.021
That's him.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.224
Thanks for dressing up.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.683
Oh. That's...

32:28.697 --> 32:30.653
- This is Katie. She's my roommate.
- Katie. Hi.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.446
- Nice to meet you.
- You're very handsome.

32:32.534 --> 32:33.364
Thank you.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.012
Did you know
that Maggie's a music producer?

32:35.036 --> 32:35.900
No, I didn't.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.532
Yeah, she's amazing.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.613
I like to say
the ear of our generation.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.450
Katie. Thank you so much
for coming to this party.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.627
Got it. I'm gonna see how much cheese
I can fit into my bag.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.830
And then I'm gonna
look his house up on zillow.

32:47.924 --> 32:48.924
Please don't.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.000
Can't make any promises.

32:52.846 --> 32:53.756
Oh, my god.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.429
You want another drink
to actually drink this time?

32:56.516 --> 33:00.134
And here I was thinking you had a crush
on me and just had to see me again.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.093
Oh, no, I'm just here for the pipes.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.056
Babe, I thought you were bringing me
a vodka red bull?

33:05.150 --> 33:06.936
Theresa, this is Maggie.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.437
Maggie's a producer.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.528
Cool.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.069
I work at spacex.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.105
Cool.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.245
Why don't you come out?
Dj for us.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.333
Wow.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.159
Is that your girlfriend?

33:25.253 --> 33:27.369
She's not looking for anything serious.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.249
Good for her.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.341
Mm-hmm.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.835
You have some lipstick.

33:31.927 --> 33:32.927
Right here?

33:33.428 --> 33:35.259
- All around your face.
- Mm.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.132
Do you have any songs recorded?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.339
Yeah.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.433
Can I hear them?

33:40.727 --> 33:42.683
Now? Yeah.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.393
J» it's incomprehensible »

33:51.488 --> 33:54.195

34:12.092 --> 34:14.925
this is pretty good.
Did you write this?

34:15.554 --> 34:17.135
Yeah, it took me, like, 20 minutes.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.928
The first verse?

34:19.014 --> 34:20.014
Whole song.

34:20.891 --> 34:24.476
Why are you performing
at grocery stores?

34:24.563 --> 34:25.973
I like it.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.897
It's fun, it's no pressure, it's just...

34:28.984 --> 34:29.984
It's nice.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.101
Well, you can write.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.730
And you've got the voice

34:36.824 --> 34:40.067
and the tone, and, I mean,
an amazing record collection.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.617
That Marvin gaye and...

34:41.705 --> 34:45.618
This elmore James, I had this cd
in my car for, like, six years.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.449
That was the first album
my dad gave me.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.543
Really?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.998
Well, I would love to...

34:55.092 --> 34:57.334
I mean, if you are...

34:57.429 --> 35:01.263
I could work with you
if you wanted.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.349
I'm listening.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.717
Well, you have an amazing sound.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.177
Thank you.

35:07.272 --> 35:10.730
I mean, there's a couple of things
that I... if I may?

35:10.817 --> 35:12.603
Please, you may.

35:13.862 --> 35:17.400
I think that your producer might be...

35:18.491 --> 35:19.491
Sucks.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.567
He's a friend of mine,
and he does it for free.

35:21.661 --> 35:22.867
I mean, what...

35:22.954 --> 35:26.947
What exactly
do you wanna do differently?

35:27.751 --> 35:30.538
Well, to start, I would...

35:30.629 --> 35:32.039
Your bassist is way too loud.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.246
And then I'd probably drop
that weird drum track.

35:34.341 --> 35:35.706
And then I'd move the bridge up.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.258
And then you should definitely be
singing into a real mic.

35:40.305 --> 35:43.422
I mean, I'm so sorry, but where did you
record this, in a closet?

35:43.516 --> 35:44.516
Wine cellar.

35:45.060 --> 35:45.924
Who?

35:46.019 --> 35:49.603
My wine cellar.
I thought the acoustics would be better.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.226
Ooh. Will you send me the files?

35:52.317 --> 35:53.317
No.

35:53.818 --> 35:54.818
Please?

35:59.032 --> 36:00.818
Come to my show next week.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.116
Um...

36:03.203 --> 36:06.821
I, well, I should ask Katie
'cause next week I was...

36:06.915 --> 36:07.995
What's that?

36:08.083 --> 36:09.083
A jacket.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.703
So, I'll see you next Friday?

36:12.545 --> 36:15.036
Oh, my god. Do you wear this?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.088
Oh, my god.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.175
What is that?

36:18.259 --> 36:21.217
This looks like Stevie nicks
ran over Jason derulo with her car.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.090
- Okay. All right, we're done.
- Oh, my god.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.137
- Thank you so much. We're good.
- That is wild.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.761
That's enough. That's enough.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.906
Hey, you know who's been up
for 37 hours?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Me...

36:52.711 --> 36:54.042
You dick.

36:59.008 --> 37:02.626
So if you can please just make sure
that she takes the fish oil

37:02.721 --> 37:05.616
and the little green one after she eats
dinner because they upset her stomach.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.007
Wow. You're really the only person I know
who can make pills not fun.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.102
Wait.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.552
Why are you leaving early?
You never leave early.

37:12.647 --> 37:13.762
Um...

37:14.482 --> 37:17.849
Because I gotta go to this thing
at the airport.

37:18.695 --> 37:19.935
'Cause my... my gran is...

37:20.029 --> 37:21.815
I don't care about any of that.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.066
Sorry.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.443
And I don't believe it.

37:24.534 --> 37:27.071
It sounds like a whole lot of b.
Bullcrap.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.403
This is exactly what happens.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.614
It starts off with a thing, and then
you're gonna ask for a weekend off.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.540
All of you assistants
are the same.

37:34.627 --> 37:38.165
You get lured in here by the glitz,
the glamor,

37:38.256 --> 37:41.123
the swag, the celebrity,
the pool house.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.502
You live in the pool house.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.255
And you could too.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.088
Not at this moment because I'm not
in the market for a roommate,

37:48.183 --> 37:50.094
but maybe someday...

37:50.185 --> 37:52.471
If you play your cards right.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.972
What are you doing?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.638
This is all available to you.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.145
Ah! Ha.

37:59.652 --> 38:00.652
Found 'em.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.110
Wow, I thought
you were cleaning the pool.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.984
See, these are a gift from grace.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.315
Do I prefer dior? Of course I do.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.741
Am I gonna tell her that?

38:08.828 --> 38:11.410
No. I'm gonna be grateful
for what I have,

38:11.498 --> 38:14.865
and for what she's discarded
because she's bored with it

38:14.959 --> 38:16.574
'cause then it comes to me.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.663
And I can wear it.

38:19.589 --> 38:22.877
And you gotta start carrying a notebook
around to write this stuff down.

38:22.967 --> 38:23.967
Margaret!

38:28.681 --> 38:30.091
Margaret!

38:31.017 --> 38:32.507
Margaret!

38:33.311 --> 38:35.302
Margaret!

38:36.981 --> 38:38.391
Margaret!

38:40.109 --> 38:41.440
Margaret!

38:41.528 --> 38:42.688
Hi.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.006
What do you think of this?

38:44.030 --> 38:45.190
Do you think it's too booby?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.112
Mm... yes.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.200
Oh.

38:48.785 --> 38:49.785
Perfect.

38:50.537 --> 38:51.537
You can go.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.157
Oh. Okay, great. Thank you so much.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.328
No, not you.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.115
You guys can go. Thank you.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.210
Thanks.

38:58.294 --> 39:00.000
- Okay, bye.
- Bye, miss Davis.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.624
Well, Margaret. Yeah?

39:02.215 --> 39:06.675
Are you sure all of this
is still okay with you?

39:06.761 --> 39:07.967
Um...

39:08.054 --> 39:12.468
'Cause after that little show
at the recording studio,

39:12.559 --> 39:14.845
I'm not sure.

39:15.979 --> 39:18.391
Because if there is something else
you wanna be doing,

39:18.481 --> 39:20.641
I don't want you to be here
if you don't wanna be here.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.776
No, grace, I...

39:26.906 --> 39:28.362
- Yes?
- I wanna be here.

39:28.449 --> 39:32.442
Good, because I wanna
go through my closet

39:32.537 --> 39:35.279
and donate things
that aren't sparking joy or whatever.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.829
Yeah, right now?

39:36.916 --> 39:37.916
Yeah.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.168
Great.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.038
Joy. Definitely joy.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.133
Joy.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.173
Oh, my god.

39:48.261 --> 39:49.261
Mm.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.510
- Joy.
- Joyful.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.634
How's everybody doing?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.761
Yeah, that's what I like to hear.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.680
Well, I'm David cliff,
and this is my band,

39:58.771 --> 40:01.411
and we're gonna play a couple songs
for y'all, if that's all right.

40:08.615 --> 40:11.948
Obviously, I'm keeping
the Gianni versace.

40:12.035 --> 40:12.899
Obviously.

40:12.994 --> 40:13.994
Yeah.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.945
All right. So we did
all the evening wear.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.290
Let's do the early evening wear.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.701
- Come on.
- 'Kay.

40:25.298 --> 40:27.539
All right, I've got one more song
for y'all tonight.

40:27.634 --> 40:28.669
Come on!

40:32.013 --> 40:33.013
Thanks for coming.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.587
Sorry.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.969
Jo / yeah...»

40:41.981 --> 40:45.314
j» I'm so in love with you »

40:46.444 --> 40:50.028
j» whatever you wanna do »

40:51.074 --> 40:54.066
j is all ight with me, yeah

40:54.160 --> 40:56.276
wow, I didn't think you'd show up.

40:56.371 --> 40:57.371
Well, we had a deal.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.945
Okay.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.040
So, what'd you think?

41:00.416 --> 41:03.203
Um, well, that was
a great song choice.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.294
Ah.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.086
And you sounded incredible.
Really good.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.084
Great start. What else?

41:10.259 --> 41:11.874
Um, well...

41:13.221 --> 41:14.336
Your band...

41:14.430 --> 41:16.341
I knew it.
You couldn't even last a minute!

41:16.432 --> 41:18.423
- The drummer.
- That's my friend!

41:18.518 --> 41:20.509
- Is he? Is he really?
- Here we go.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.594
Here we go again. Wow.

41:22.689 --> 41:27.433
You asked me, and I'm not gonna tell you
that they're great if they're not great.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.148
I know there's a compliment
in there somewhere for me,

41:32.073 --> 41:33.734
if you want to be more direct.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.565
Can I show you something?

41:35.660 --> 41:37.070
Is this your car?

41:37.787 --> 41:38.993
Yeah.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.490
Should I sign a waiver?

41:44.502 --> 41:45.787
Okay.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.838
» 7his is more than a feeling »

41:57.932 --> 41:58.967
is this my song?

41:59.058 --> 42:00.423
> More than attraction... »

42:00.518 --> 42:01.598
oh, my...

42:02.603 --> 42:05.720
The drum pattern is not bad.

42:05.815 --> 42:08.557
I also brought you up a bit,
and I re-recorded the guitar.

42:08.651 --> 42:11.893
Yes, it's good. It's good.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.733
You have real talent.

42:14.824 --> 42:16.189
You really do.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.024
Do you need me? No.

42:18.828 --> 42:19.828
But you should want me

42:19.912 --> 42:23.621
because I think I can help bring out
an entirely different sound in you.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.709
And if you work with me,
I can get you heard by the right people.

42:27.795 --> 42:29.285
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

42:30.339 --> 42:33.206
I just want to know
who else you working with right now.

42:33.926 --> 42:37.214
A producer never discusses artists
with other artists.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.512
That's just not part of the...

42:39.599 --> 42:40.599
Okay.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.681
Okay.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.725
How do you...

42:46.731 --> 42:48.722
How do you know how to do
all of this stuff?

42:52.028 --> 42:56.021
I grew up around music and musicians
and people talking about music.

42:56.115 --> 42:59.232
My dad worked in radio,
and my mom was a singer.

42:59.327 --> 43:02.239
And then I went to school for composing,
and then immediately after,

43:02.330 --> 43:03.661
I started...

43:04.457 --> 43:05.457
Producing.

43:06.125 --> 43:07.990
If you could point
to any time in my life,

43:08.086 --> 43:09.166
good or bad,

43:09.253 --> 43:12.120
I could tell you who I was listening to
and how I got through it.

43:12.215 --> 43:16.299
And if I had the opportunity
to work with an artist like you...

43:17.845 --> 43:20.461
And create something
that could maybe

43:20.556 --> 43:24.265
make somebody or anybody feel
a little bit less alone,

43:24.352 --> 43:26.263
then I want to be a part of that.

43:26.979 --> 43:29.265
I know how to be a part of that.

43:29.816 --> 43:30.816
So...

43:35.363 --> 43:39.276
7he staple singers
doing "the weight," originally by...

43:39.367 --> 43:40.573
The band.

43:40.660 --> 43:41.820
The band.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.165
All right, when do we start?

43:52.630 --> 43:53.460
Now.

43:53.548 --> 43:54.663
Now?

43:56.134 --> 43:57.715
Well, I... no, actually I have to...

43:58.970 --> 44:01.131
Tomorrow or, you know,
when I can find time,

44:01.222 --> 44:03.429
I'll have my office reach out.

44:03.516 --> 44:05.006
The "office." All right.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.013
Okay, get out! I gotta go.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.139
Come on.

44:09.230 --> 44:11.083
What you talking about?
It's a Friday night.

44:11.107 --> 44:13.940
I know. I have to work in the morning.
I'm in demand...

44:14.569 --> 44:17.686
By an artist who doesn't
have their shirts custom-made.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.905
It's good though, right?

44:32.461 --> 44:33.701
Coming up next,

44:33.796 --> 44:38.881
grace Davis is set to release a live album
recorded at her tenth world tour.

44:38.968 --> 44:42.301
The music icon
has remained a remarkably private person.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.094
She's never married or had children,

44:44.182 --> 44:47.094
and is tight-lipped
about her plans for the future.

44:47.894 --> 44:51.807
All her fans are wondering,
"when can they expect another hit?"

44:51.898 --> 44:57.268
But first, hitmaker cardi b on what it's
like fo have yet another number-one song.

44:59.113 --> 45:00.148
You okay?

45:01.699 --> 45:02.859
Do I not look okay?

45:03.451 --> 45:05.191
No, you look great. Amazing.

45:05.995 --> 45:08.657
Well, good, 'cause Michael b. Jordan's
coming over tonight.

45:09.665 --> 45:10.575
Here?

45:10.666 --> 45:12.327
You gotta be out of here by 5:00.

45:12.418 --> 45:13.248
Okay.

45:13.336 --> 45:15.793
And can you get me everything
off the Jon & vinny's menu?

45:15.880 --> 45:17.290
The dessert section 00?

45:18.674 --> 45:19.789
I don't eat dessert.

45:20.301 --> 45:21.301
Okay.

45:22.470 --> 45:26.930
Can you make sure the sexecology oil
is upstairs in my bathroom?

46:04.595 --> 46:05.595
Oh, my god!

46:06.305 --> 46:08.421
I'm really, really so sorry
about your face.

46:09.058 --> 46:12.926
But let's just be honest and say that
that wasn't really the best place to sit.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.440
Who's that?

46:18.818 --> 46:20.854
My dad, David cliff senior.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.105
That's your dad?

46:22.196 --> 46:23.311
Yeah. “Wow.

46:23.406 --> 46:24.691
Sax player.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.905
He plays better
than anyone else I know.

46:27.660 --> 46:29.321
So, you said
your mom was a singer?

46:29.412 --> 46:32.279
Well, she was.
She died when I was six.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.238
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

46:34.333 --> 46:38.667
She met my dad backstage
at a Paul Simon concert.

46:38.754 --> 46:41.496
My dad was there
covering the show for work.

46:42.008 --> 46:44.795
And they met and then she moved in
with him the next day,

46:44.885 --> 46:46.876
and they got married a month later.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.131
Pretty crazy.

46:48.931 --> 46:50.011
Not that crazy.

46:51.267 --> 46:52.598
What about your mom and dad?

46:53.519 --> 46:54.975
Never married.

46:55.062 --> 46:58.225
My mom, she left me with my dad
when I was little.

46:59.442 --> 47:02.024
And it was complicated.

47:02.570 --> 47:03.650
I don't know.

47:04.488 --> 47:05.978
My dad's cool though.

47:06.073 --> 47:11.113
Pissed I don't play sax,
but, you know, he's there for me. Yeah.

47:11.203 --> 47:12.818
How's your head? Let's see.

47:13.998 --> 47:14.998
Ooh.

47:15.082 --> 47:16.082
"Ooh," what?

47:16.167 --> 47:17.953
- Are you laughing at me?
- Oh, man.

47:18.044 --> 47:20.325
This is my moneymaker,
so I don't really get what's funny.

47:22.798 --> 47:25.005
So, composing major,

47:26.177 --> 47:27.337
can you play?

47:27.428 --> 47:28.634
This keyboard?

47:28.721 --> 47:29.961
Whichever one you like.

47:30.806 --> 47:34.515
Typically, I'm just... I'm in the studio,
I'm behind the boards,

47:34.602 --> 47:36.558
and I allow, you know,

47:37.313 --> 47:40.476
the artist to create.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.431
- So...
- F.

47:43.694 --> 47:44.809
Uh-huh. To e minor.

47:47.615 --> 47:49.276
- That?
- Yeah, like that.

47:49.992 --> 47:51.357
So it's just...

47:58.584 --> 48:00.120
To e.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.211
Yeah.

48:01.504 --> 48:02.619
Uh-huh.

48:02.713 --> 48:03.713
To f.

48:03.798 --> 48:05.379
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.456
Stop interrupting yourself.

48:08.636 --> 48:09.916
Let's try it again.

48:12.181 --> 48:13.261
Okay. It was...

48:16.894 --> 48:19.385
- Uh... that?
- No, but I like that.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.142
Do it fast like that again.
Yeah, punch it. Punch it more.

48:24.026 --> 48:25.026
Yeah.

48:27.947 --> 48:29.153
And then what about...

48:31.951 --> 48:32.951
All right.

48:33.411 --> 48:34.867

I have these really incredible...

49:11.157 --> 49:13.443
I can't. Playing a bat mitzvah.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.654
What?? “What?

49:15.744 --> 49:18.235
I don't...
David, I don't understand.

49:18.330 --> 49:21.288
Clearly, you're not doing
these gigs for money.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.706
I made a commitment.

49:23.335 --> 49:26.543
Okay. I'm not gonna beg you
to take this seriously.

49:27.298 --> 49:28.458
Don't beg me.

49:28.549 --> 49:31.416
David, you have an incredible voice.

49:33.429 --> 49:38.469
When you sing, it's restrained
and impassioned and nostalgic, and...

49:40.561 --> 49:43.928
People outside of various
la community centers should hear it.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.479
But what if I'm not good enough?

49:45.566 --> 49:46.396
What?

49:46.484 --> 49:48.475
What if I'm just some douchebag

49:48.569 --> 49:51.561
who thought he could be a singer
like everybody else, and then what?

49:52.239 --> 49:53.820
Then what am I supposed to do?

49:56.410 --> 49:57.410
Oh, my god.

49:57.870 --> 49:58.870
What?

49:58.954 --> 50:00.319
You're insecure.

50:01.916 --> 50:03.531
This is amazing.

50:05.294 --> 50:08.457
I'm coming at you with
some deep-seated anxiety right now, and...

50:08.547 --> 50:11.755
No. You're just self-sabotaging,
and I can work with that.

50:13.636 --> 50:14.636
Sorry.

50:16.514 --> 50:17.924
Hello? Hello?

50:18.349 --> 50:19.805
Oh, okay. I...

50:19.892 --> 50:22.053
Yes, I'll be right there. Okay.

50:24.563 --> 50:27.600
That was another client,
so I have to go.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.359
You're amazing.

50:29.443 --> 50:32.105
And I will see you soon.

50:32.196 --> 50:34.778
And we will continue this conversation.
Yes.

50:34.865 --> 50:35.865
Okay, bye.

50:39.245 --> 50:41.361
Thank you. Very nice.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.250
Wait.

50:45.834 --> 50:47.449
Is this your car?

50:47.545 --> 50:49.786
Why do people
keep asking me that? Yeah.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.667
You need to ask your boss
for a raise.

50:56.262 --> 50:59.470
That's so funny. Do you get it?
Because I'm your boss!

51:02.351 --> 51:03.431
Do you get it?

51:04.186 --> 51:06.723
Wait. Pull over.
Right here, right here, right here.

51:06.814 --> 51:09.806
Hey. Can I get two carnitas, please?

51:10.442 --> 51:12.273
And one of them should be chicken,

51:12.361 --> 51:14.101
with hot sauce.

51:15.281 --> 51:21.447
So, Michael b. Jordan insisted
that we leave my house

51:21.537 --> 51:23.653
and go to a hotel,

51:23.747 --> 51:30.209
because he had
this whole proposal planned.

51:31.088 --> 51:34.455
We have very different problems.

51:34.550 --> 51:36.461
What are your problems, Margaret?

51:36.552 --> 51:38.213
Well, I mean...

51:38.304 --> 51:40.090
- I'm hungry.
- Oh.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.590
- I'm so hungry.
- Okay.

51:41.682 --> 51:43.673
Is the food coming, sir?

51:43.767 --> 51:45.257
Ma'am, we've been over this.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.434
We are not a drive-through.

51:47.896 --> 51:50.729
Okay, well, it should be.
It could be.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.602
Oh, my god. Is that grace Davis?

51:53.736 --> 51:55.772
- Hi, I love you so much.
- I love you.

51:55.863 --> 51:57.819
- Can I take a picture with you?
- I know.

51:57.906 --> 51:59.021
Sure. Yeah.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.198
- It's grace Davis!
- I'm gonna get out.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.071
Hi. This isn't my car.

52:03.162 --> 52:03.992
Hello.

52:04.079 --> 52:06.433
Okay, followers,
look who I am with. It's grace Davis!

52:06.457 --> 52:09.073
- Okay. One, two, hi, grace Davis!
- Hi!

52:09.168 --> 52:10.728
You look gorgeous!

52:11.420 --> 52:12.956
So glad I called you.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.628
Usually, you call Gail.

52:15.716 --> 52:17.957
Are you kidding me?

52:18.052 --> 52:21.636
It's after 10 o'clock.
Miss galil is passed out.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.798
Anyway, I thought
you would enjoy this time with me

52:25.893 --> 52:29.010
'cause you're always
hanging around me,

52:29.104 --> 52:30.890
just hanging around me.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.476
That's my job.

52:33.567 --> 52:34.682
You know what I mean.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.028
Would you get married?

52:41.200 --> 52:44.158
Oh, my god. Not you too.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.951
I know that everybody wonders,

52:47.039 --> 52:49.826
"is grace gonna find a man?"

52:49.917 --> 52:50.997
I mean...

52:52.086 --> 52:54.122
"Who's gonna put a ring on it?"

52:54.963 --> 52:56.169
You know what?

52:58.092 --> 52:59.502
I'm happy with me.

53:00.552 --> 53:02.634
I am happy with me.

53:02.721 --> 53:03.721
Yup.

53:06.266 --> 53:09.349
I just thought that maybe
if you were gonna do anybody the favor,

53:09.436 --> 53:11.802
then it may as well be
Michael b. Jordan.

53:12.606 --> 53:13.891
I almost did.

53:15.401 --> 53:16.401
Once.

53:17.653 --> 53:19.518
Really? Yeah.

53:21.323 --> 53:24.907
But I was too young.

53:30.374 --> 53:34.617
We were in love and the whole thing.

53:38.048 --> 53:40.039
It was before all this happened.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.093
Then it did.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.555
And I didn't choose him.

53:50.519 --> 53:51.519
Obviously.

53:53.272 --> 53:54.728
I didn't want it.

53:56.442 --> 53:57.682
I don't want it.

53:59.194 --> 54:02.186
I chose those countertops
in the bathroom.

54:02.281 --> 54:05.944
They were like, "you can have two sinks."
And I was like, "no."

54:06.034 --> 54:09.947
"I want one, one big one.”

54:11.039 --> 54:13.030
- It is a very big sink.
- Mm-hmm.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.701
What's happening?

54:20.007 --> 54:21.872
Why are you all dressed up?

54:23.552 --> 54:29.422
Why did you have to
steal from the needy

54:29.516 --> 54:32.553
and take this
$3,000 Saint Laurent jacket?

54:32.644 --> 54:34.134
How much?

54:34.229 --> 54:37.016
- Oh, wait. Were you with a boy?
- No.

54:37.107 --> 54:40.725
Yes, you were!
You were on a date!

54:40.819 --> 54:41.899
Okay. Okay.

54:47.284 --> 54:50.196
Does he know who I am?

54:53.540 --> 54:56.623
Well, he lives on earth, so, yeah.

54:57.419 --> 54:58.704
Listen to me, Margaret.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.462
I am a very big draw.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.664
Okay?

55:03.759 --> 55:04.999
So you...

55:05.886 --> 55:08.423
You make sure
he's with you for you, okay?

55:09.056 --> 55:10.796
- Okay.
- Okay.

55:10.891 --> 55:12.097
Thank you.

55:40.212 --> 55:42.453
So, this is just practice.

55:42.965 --> 55:44.546
You don't...

55:44.633 --> 55:47.591
There's no band. It's just you.
No pressure. Okay?

55:47.678 --> 55:48.918
Mm-hmm.

55:49.012 --> 55:50.452
Just pretend
you're at a bat mitzvah.

55:51.098 --> 55:52.258
Mm.

55:56.854 --> 55:58.685
- Okay. You wanna try one?
- Mm-hmm.

also did "bills, bills, bills"
for destiny's child?

a sinéad o'Connor song?

- Hey, Dave. How are you?

- Can I get you something to drink?
- No. I'm fine.

thanks for coming in.

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:07.967
Hmm.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.923
This is Spencer.
He's on national press.

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:10.928
Hi, Spencer.

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:14.056
Can I just say my mom's more excited
about me working with you

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:15.512
than when I graduated Stanford.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.017
What was that, like, a week ago?

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:19.895
I told you she was hilarious.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:21.897
Yeah, that's a good one.

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:27.858
Baby, we are so excited about
your live album release party next week.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:30.740
Ugh, we're thrilled you okayed
Ariana grande to open for you.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:31.865
She's amazing.

01:02:31.957 --> 01:02:33.163
Her mom loves you too.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:34.750
Spencer? Yeah.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.074
No more mom stuff.

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:40.620
You guys didn't bring me all the way down
here so you could tell me that, did you?

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:44.882
That's great.

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.881
Once the live album is out,

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.384
we want to make sure
we think through your next moves.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:50.884
Yeah, what do you want to do next?

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:53.724
Well, um...

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.140
I've been thinking, and...

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.728
I think it's time
I record a new album.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.569
Um...

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.196
Well, I mean, that's one plan.

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:17.074
Uh, we've talked about
a few different things,

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:19.500
and we really wanna know
what you wanna do.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:23.546
I mean, where do you envision
grace Davis in the future?

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.134
Yeah.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.217
Have you thought any more
about the Vegas residency?

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.966
We talked about Vegas, remember?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:33.890
We think it's a cool, reliable way
for you to showcase where you're at.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.605
- Could be fun.
- I mean, I'MMA have fun.

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:47.778
At least I can get a damn drink somewhere.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:51.240
- Price of one.
- We'll get you a damn drink.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.738
We're super excited.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.195
If you want, I can show you
the slideshow I put together?

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:08.132
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.931
I thought
you didn't wanna do Vegas.

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:17.221
I said I didn't wanna talk about it.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.432
It's a big commitment.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:24.858
You heard what they said.
It's not the same as it used to be.

01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:28.485
Yeah.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:30.313
Some of their ideas weren't terrible.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:34.572
Yeah. I think a spotify-curated
Christmas album could be super cool.

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.493
Okay, just say it, all right?

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.663
I get it.
I know what you're thinking.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.833
I'm a sellout. I get it.
That was humiliating. Yup.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.535
You got to witness it.
“What? No.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.665
It's fantastic.

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:46.621
That's not what...

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.172
Grace,

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:53.674
those pretentious sparkling-water
blowhards just spoke to you

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:56.723
like they forgot that you basically built
this entire label for them.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.176
They were just trying to help me.
“What?

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.103
You've got, like,
years of career moves ahead of you.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:05.227
If you wanna do Vegas,
then fine, do Vegas.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:07.855
But don't do it
like it's your farewell tour.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:11.063
It's not over for you.
You said it in there. You said it.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.443
A new album.
That is what you should be doing.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:16.117
Do you know what
they were avoiding saying in there?

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:17.284
What?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.954
In the history of music,

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:25.661
only five women over 40
have ever had a number-one hit.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.370
And only one of them was black.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:28.955
One.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.915
Do you understand that?

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.500
No.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.836
You do not understand that.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.674
And none of you guys in there understand
what I have been through.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.762
So, I don't know.
We could just pretend.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.473
We could pretend
that we live in some sort of magical world

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:51.187
where, I don't know, let's see,
age and race are not a thing.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.067
Then do you know
what the problem is?

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:55.649
L, not the label, not Jack,

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:56.823
not you,

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:59.744
have to come up with shit
that people give a shit about,

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:01.617
and I don't know
how to do that anymore!

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.494
I don't know
if I know how to do that.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.585
Oh, my god.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.546
I know you've been writing.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:11.713
What?

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.258
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:15.698
Have you been
going through my stuff?

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.929
No. That's not what I did.
You know what? No. No.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.430
I am not here for you.

01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.015
You are here for me.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:27.188
I am not your stepping-stone.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.857
You're not a producer, Margaret.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:33.482
I didn't ask you to produce my song.
And I'm not gonna say thank you either.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:38.325
You're an encyclopedia.
You memorize trivia.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.322
You handle my itinerary.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:44.489
You pick peanuts
out of kung pao chicken.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.417
You're not the ticket
to people's breakthrough.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:48.504
Okay?

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:51.918
And those guys in there,
they're way better than you,

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.715
because they were setting me up
for an easy win.

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:57.919
And you, little lady,
are setting me up for a fail. Thank you.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.648
J» something I could say fo sefttle...

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:19.364
You're late.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.362
I mean, what's up, mags?
We doing this or what?

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:27.452
Um, yeah. Let's, uh...

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:33.497
Uh, why don't we just take it from, um...

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.673
Why don't we take it from, um...

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:42.153
Let's just take it from, um...

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:45.894
Fuck.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:56.446
Maggie.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:00.572
What was that?

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:04.694
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:06.029
You okay?

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.364
All right.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:09.209
Okay.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:10.791
Okay, what's wrong?

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:12.459
Nothing.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:14.413
Nothing?

01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:18.299
Yeah? Yeah.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:19.216
Okay.

01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.010
- All right. Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.715
Do you not want
to do this anymore?

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.971
Is that what's wrong?
Do you not...

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.143
Is that what it is?

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:32.649
No.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.019
No?

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:37.398
No, no. I mean, no,
I want this more than anything.

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.776
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:47.612
You don't?

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:48.999
Mm-mmm.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:52.332
You sure freaked out James
when you told him

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.332
if he didn't get his tuning right,
you was gonna run over him, so...

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.582
- That's...
- Well, it's a really big problem.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:01.171
Look, Maggie, you got all of us
in that room. Okay?

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.544
I know it wasn't easy.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.506
You've got that drummer in there,
and I don't know where he came from,

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.185
but he's, like, I think he's big time.
You know?

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.140
Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.685
So you know what you like.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.814
That's what makes you great.

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:24.649
Just glad I made the cut.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:27.245
Well...

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:29.581
Barely.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:36.832
Did you come up with that guitar riff
in there?

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:38.799
Yeah.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:40.502
It's pretty good.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.964
I'm pretty good.
I did it last night. It was easy.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:48.805
- You could tighten it up. Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

Yes. Yes. Yes.
That's what I'm talking about.

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.461
Oh, my god, y'all are good.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.048
Okay, let's stop for a second.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:27.970
Okay.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.513
Something's off, yeah?

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:31.678
Yeah. I think...

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:35.353
I feel like it needs some, like,
layers, you know?

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.180
A little bit of warmth, and...
Yeah.

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:40.608
Um, maybe some harmonies.
I can get some backup singers.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:44.438
Can you do it? We could always replace it.
I just want to hear it right now.

01:10:44.532 --> 01:10:46.523
I can have somebody here
in an hour. We'll just...

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:47.732
Maggie.

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:50.996
David.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.662
- Maggie.
- David, no.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.035
You know the song.

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.576
We wrote the song, right?

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.377
We've done it a hundred times.
Just come on and do it. It'll be fun.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:03.502
This is my area,
and that's your area.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.800
- So, nope.
- Maggie, please.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.003
Don't push me, David.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.507
Come on.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.009
Oh, my god. No.

I'll send you
those guitar parts, okay?

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.526
- All right. Peace.
- Thank you.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.131
- Have a good one, man.
- You too.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:47.800
- Bye, Seth.
- Bye.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.002
You're the best.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.384
Love that guy.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.386
- He's pretty good.
- Good guy.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:55.557
Yeah.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.852
You're not too bad, right?
A little bit of...

01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:01.056
- Oh. Wow. Yup, and it...
- Bada... boom.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.766
And...

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:16.786
Okay.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.160
Okay.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.334
So, that was a great session,

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.538
and I think that everyone feels

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:27.544
- very good about it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:29.091
So, I'll e-mail you.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:34.597
And... we will chat soon.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:45.983
What?

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:48.234
Oh, god.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:49.948
No.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:55.860
We have a problem with the release party.
Ariana can't perform.

01:12:55.955 --> 01:13:00.073
She's trying to finish a six-part album,
and she won't leave the studio,

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:02.032
and that's crazy, but...

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.664
What about what's his face?

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.496
- The guy who hit on us at the grammys?
- He hit on you.

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:07.876
- The weeknd?
- That one. Yes.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.253
He is on tour in Europe.
And also, he has a girlfriend.

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:12.676
Okay, great.
Well, let me just do your job for you.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:14.879
- Taylor swift.
- She's writing a memoir.

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:18.765
- Do I need to lecture you...
- No.

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:23.768
On the importance of an opener
for an album release?

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:27.233
Does she need to lecture you,
Maggie? That was the question.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.814
Okay, Margaret, I'm not gonna come out
there to a cold crowd like an amateur.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.364
You have totally screwed this up.

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.237
And I have noticed

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:37.068
that you have not been
focused on your job

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:38.448
over the last few weeks.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:41.155
I've noticed that. I'll fix it.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.787
Because scheduling is
in my very limited wheelhouse.

01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:47.120
Well, then, why don't you find someone
who's not gonna embarrass me?

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.918
=I will. - Great. Thank you.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.779
- It'd be nice if you could do your job.
- Dan would love to do it.

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:55.590
Fine. I don't care. Whatever.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:57.512
Hey, it's me. Can I come up?

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.240
Is this a work thing?

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:01.394
No.

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:02.479
Then no.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:06.389
Oh! Hey, David.
You wanna come in?

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.099
Is she gonna say
it's not a good idea?

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.797
7his isn't a good idea.
We need fo focus on our work fogether...

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:11.685
Yeah. Forget it.

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:14.443
And not be blurring the lines,
and, you know...

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:16.858
- I let him up.
- What?

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:23.156
Okay, listen. Brian Epstein
did not sleep with the Beatles.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.206
Jerry wexler and aretha? No.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.785
Jimmy lovine and Springsteen? No.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.212
Actually, he did have a whole thing
with Stevie nicks.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:34.087
Anyway, David geffen...
Also had a thing with Cher.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:39.051
And people do think that Brian Epstein was
in love with John Lennon, so there's...

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:41.299
This is not...

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:42.727
I'm not...

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.312
You should... I think you should go.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.435
- Cher's amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:49.561
So sexy.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:53.387

for the release party on Friday?

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:45.787
Yeah, yeah. Of course I did. Yeah.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.412
When was you gonna tell me, huh?
He better be there.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:49.742
Yeah, it... oh.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:53.506
Okay.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:00.047
What are you doing on Friday?

01:16:00.765 --> 01:16:02.301
Hopefully this again.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:08.223
Hi. It's Maggie.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:11.977
Hey, girl. Dan is so excited
for grace's party later.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:15.356
Well, that's what I was calling to talk
to you about. Do you have a quick sec?

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:18.438
I'm actually waiting on him
to get out of a meeting right now. So...

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:20.068
Oh. A meeting. Really?

01:16:22.495 --> 01:16:25.282
- Maggie? How did you know we were here?
- Please.

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:28.159
Everybody knows this is the first place
he comes when he comes to la.

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.116
How long have you been
Dan's assistant?

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.702
Like, five years? Yeah.

01:16:32.797 --> 01:16:35.584
Have you ever wanted to do something
other than be his assistant?

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:39.337
Well, between you and me,
I've been working on a screenplay.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.419
It's 200 pages, but I'm confident.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:42.754
- It's hilarious.
- Great. Yeah.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:47.301
So, what would you do to get, like,
I don't know, Spielberg to read it?

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:49.851
- Anything.
- Anything, right?

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:53.227
So, I've been working with
this really incredible artist on the side

01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:54.477
without grace knowing.

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:58.026
And I know that Dan has already committed
to doing the party on Friday,

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:00.821
but I need you to help me
ocean's eleven this whole thing

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:03.069
and get him to drop out
at the last minute,

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.448
so then I can swoop in and I can get
my artist heard by grace and the label.

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:10.248
Then everyone is gonna lose their minds,
clearly, like I've lost my mind,

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:13.497
and I'm gonna change
the trajectory of our entire lives.

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:14.747
Roll credits.

01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:17.246
I love ocean's eleven.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:24.222
Hey.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:27.590

01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:45.445
j [ Can't concentrate with you behind me j

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:46.536
> oh nod

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:50.946
all right. I'm in.

01:17:51.041 --> 01:17:52.577
Shut up.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:55.159
It'll piss off grace,
but she needs a kick in the ass.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:58.337
Sure you're ready for this?
Working with musicians?

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:04.210
People like me, grace, this kid.
Crazy little gods.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.549
Before you know it,

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.053
you'll be on tour when you're supposed
to be best man at your brother's wedding.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.664
Or in the studio
when your kid's winning the nationals.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.600
Or buying another Rolls-Royce
when you've already got three.

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:17.689
No, four.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:19.725
Yes.

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:24.405
Then you realize, "damn, I'm writing
lyrics on a napkin in a toilet,

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:27.403
and I'm supposed to be at the reception
for my fourth wedding."

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.240
No, fifth wedding.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:38.335
And you think
this kid can handle that?

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:40.632
I do.

01:18:41.508 --> 01:18:43.214
And you think
you can handle that?

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:44.302
I do.

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.428
And do you want it
more than blood?

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:49.592
I do.

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:54.928
Send me the rest of his stuff.
I want to play it in the car.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.579
Here's pictures of me
and shwayze, man.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.331
This girl right here can sing!

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:22.959
Make sure you tag me in that, girl.
Instagram, all them 'grams you got.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.416
I'm the star now!

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:27.342
And which is my better side, Jack?

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.509
Whatever side I'm on.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:31.618
- This shit is confusing.
- Jack. Hi. Sorry.

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:33.223
Can I just get a quick... one sec.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:35.801
Yeah. Thank you,
'cause he talking about vr.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:38.137
Why can't people just take shrooms
like they used to?

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:39.972
Um...

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:41.398
Dan is a no-go.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:43.569
What?

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:47.146
Yeah. He's not able to make it.

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:49.197
So, I have a plan b.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.401
- You said you was gonna handle this.
- I am. Trust me.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.580
Where's your guitar?

01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:56.465
In the car.
I thought we were going to dinner.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.624
- Why this one? Oh, god.
- What? Why not?

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:02.954
Okay. I'm gonna need you to fight the urge
to get really mad at me right now.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:04.538
Okay. I mean, what's going on?

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.089
Um...

01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:08.792
Well, there's been
a little change of plans.

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:09.887
First of all...

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:13.759
I'm not a producer.

01:20:13.851 --> 01:20:16.968
- What?
- I mean, I am, but I'm not a real one.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.303
I'm a personal assistant.

01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:22.143
I'm an assistant
to a big-time singer

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:24.395
who is having a big party tonight,

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:28.320
and her whole label is gonna be there
and a lot of other music people,

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:29.943
and you're gonna sing for them.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.241
That's good, right?

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:34.952
You're...

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:36.946
You're an assistant?

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:43.127
Yeah, I am. I'm an assistant too.
But my boss, grace Davis, is awesome.

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:44.794
You work for grace Davis?

01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:45.917
Yeah.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:50.963
Wow.

01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:52.591
David! Hey, wait!

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.137
Does she know about this?

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.633
No, not yet.
But she's gonna love you.

01:20:57.728 --> 01:21:00.891
Do you even have any clients?
I mean, did you lie about that too?

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:04.515
Oh, my god.

01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:08.648
I'm sorry. I should have told you.
And I'm sorry that I...

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:11.568
But we can talk
about all of this later...

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.444
You know, you're so arrogant.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.906
You don't know shit.
You don't know anything.

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:19.158
You just walk around pretending.
Who does that?

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:22.912
I'm sorry I lied to you. It was wrong,
but we made something really good.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:26.166
And it deserves a shot.
I think you deserve a shot.

01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:28.338
What's in there,
that could change your whole life!

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:29.790
It could change
both of our lives.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.750
I'm not your escape plan, Maggie.

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:33.711
That's...

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:35.845
That's not what I...

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.184
David!

01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.551
And I love this jacket.

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:53.231
I'm gonna have another sip
of this, and I'll be right back.

01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:55.320
Dumbass millennials.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.779
Did you figure it out?

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:04.666
This was your second chance.

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.499
You couldn't handle it.

01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:09.747
You wanna be a producer?

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:16.137
Producing is about trust
and commitment

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:19.006
and taking care of your artist.

01:22:20.853 --> 01:22:22.844
You couldn't even do that
as an assistant.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:27.473
Why would I want to work with you?
Why would anyone want to work with you?

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.152
We're done.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:35.857
Grace, it's time.

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:37.316
Thanks, Jack.

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:43.121
If you need a reference
for your next job,

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.407
have 'em give me a call.

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:47.955
I got a lot to say.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.666
Ladies and gentlemen, grace Davis.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.132
Hello, everyone.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.085
How are you?

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:01.049
So, it looks like I'll be opening
for myself tonight.

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:14.145
Hey, I'm sorry
today was such a shit day.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:17.405
I opened the Adele basket.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:18.493
Okay.

01:23:32.633 --> 01:23:33.793
I would never leave you.

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:36.135
What am I saying?

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:40.095
No, we were all meant to be together!
Come on.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.470
We're going home.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:17.008
J 1 didn't mean to hurt you >

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:25.303
> and I'm sorry I made you cry »

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.144
j» I'm just a jealous guy »

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:37.061
d> I'm just a jealous guy »

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:45.945
and that is the late,
great Donny hathaway

01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:48.280
doing John Lennon's "jealous guy"...

01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:50.081
Live at the bitter end.

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:52.329
Live at the bitter end.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:55.955
Hey, magpie.

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:57.084
Hi, dad.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:00.960
I gotta stop by Johnny's.

01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:04.718
Just a few things,
then we'll be home.

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:06.973
What do you have to do?

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:10.479
All right.

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:26.370
All right.

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:29.579
What do we need?
Want to order some pizza?

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:58.434
Hey, Maggie.

01:25:58.528 --> 01:26:00.359
I gotta do the morning show.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:02.859
Want to come with me?

01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:03.949
No.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.446
What?

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:09.236
It's the singer-songwriter hour.

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:11.697
Gonna start with joni Mitchell.

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:15.250
You know what album
I'm thinking of?

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:17.505
Guess.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:21.336
Was she dating
David Crosby or Jackson browne?

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:22.711
James Taylor.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:26.962
My favorite. For the roses.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:29.218
Attagirl.

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:36.392
Yeah, it's all about being a rock star,
dating a rock star, and heroin.

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:39.350
I can't believe
I let her stay with me this long.

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.184
- She was always in my face.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:44.146
"Hi. I'm Maggie.
I know everything about everything.

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:46.983
Oh, I'm in the studio. I'm a producer.

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:50.911
I can pull off bangs." No, you can't.
No, you can't because it's not 1970.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:53.454
Hasn't been 1970 for some years.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.874
- Oh, my god. Okay.
- She's a nightmare person.

01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:57.451
And she's a bummer to be around.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:26:59.332
Why is she always asking
if you need water?

01:26:59.423 --> 01:27:00.423
I don't know.

01:27:00.507 --> 01:27:03.427
And she's constantly listening to
your songs over and over and over again.

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:04.583
Oh, my god.

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:08.886
And honestly, grace,

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:12.762
I thought she was gonna be the one who
would stick it out. I tried to help her.

01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:14.889
- Did you talk to her?
- I did talk to her.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:15.980
Okay.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:19.807
And I tried to tell her
that this was an enormous opportunity.

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:22.768
And I saw myself in her.
You know?

01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:27.152
Before I became the strong,
independent woman that I am today.

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:32.194
I think she's just
obsessed with you.

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:34.996
She never asked you for anything,
which was weird.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:37.745
Well, she actually did. “What?

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:42.170
Did she ask you for those Louboutins?
Because those are mine, grace.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:45.670
It goes from grace
to getty images to Gail.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:47.843
No, she wanted to produce.

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:50.347
Who?

01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:55.016
Me.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:01.940
Why?

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:05.488
I mean, you're retired.

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:09.658
I'm not retired.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.445
Yeah, I'm a singer, galil.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.366
I thought we were retired.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.592
Is she any good?

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:50.318
Next up,
a song by the great Lee Moses.

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:51.238
No.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:55.239
Made famous
by the one and only grace Davis,

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.742
here's "bad girl."

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:00.040
7his is a song
about a bad girl...

01:29:00.126 --> 01:29:02.287
I really don't want to hear this
right now.

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:03.744
Ohl

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.046
your mother loved that song, huh?

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:08.088
I knew the grace version.

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:09.586
Everybody did.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.962
But she knew all the covers.
She was obsessed by 'em.

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:20.807
You know the way a song can be one thing
when it comes out of somebody's mouth,

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:23.229
and then, magic.

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:26.558
Suddenly,
it belongs to somebody else.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:29.060
You know, it's hard.

01:29:29.155 --> 01:29:33.398
It's hard for me to think
that one day you're gonna wake up,

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:35.984
and you're gonna be older
than your mother ever was.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:37.788
Dad.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.869
But if she knew that you worked
for grace Davis for two...

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.750
- Three.
- Three years...

01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:50.957
She'd have been
so proud and jealous.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:54.052
And she wouldn't want you
hiding out here.

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:56.300
Well, I really blew it.

01:29:56.975 --> 01:30:03.312
But I did learn more than I'll ever learn
anywhere else, working for grace.

01:30:04.774 --> 01:30:08.141
I didn't even know I wanted
to be a producer when I started there.

01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:11.895
And what did she say
when you told her that?

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:15.315
You did tell her that, right?

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:18.152
She does not want to talk to me.

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:21.829
I think, forever.

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:23.407
Maggie, come on.

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:28.086
You can wallow around here,
or you can try to make things right.

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:29.754
I'm not wallowing.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:30.921
Well, call her.

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:38.555
All right.
What are you gonna start with tonight?

01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:39.642
Hmm.

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:41.300
Maybe this one.

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:44.386
Nope. Uh... please.

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:46.938
Not "landslide" by the Dixie chicks.

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:48.640
It's a great song.

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:51.362
No.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.481
Good evening,
this is Maggie sherwoode.

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:58.908
I will be covering for Don
for the next couple weeks.

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:02.036
I'm gonna kick it off
with three different versions

01:31:02.123 --> 01:31:07.584
of "the first cut is the deepest,”
originally by cat-Yusuf Stevens.

01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:12.131
J» I would have given you all of my heart

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.715
Jesus Christ.

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.964
J» but there's someone
who's forn it apart »

01:31:17.055 --> 01:31:21.389

01:31:26.439 --> 01:31:29.146
j» baby, I'll try to love again »

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:30.269
oh, no.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.021
> But! Know »

01:31:35.782 --> 01:31:40.993
> the first cut is the deepest
baby, I know »

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:43.821
j» the first cut is the deepest »

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:48.207
I'm gonna call her.

01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:49.454
Okay.

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:52.795
- Where's my cart?
- It's a long story.

01:31:52.882 --> 01:31:54.042
It died.

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:58.093
Hi, grace. It's Maggie...
Margaret sherwoode.

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:00.129
Um...

01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:04.261
I'm sorry about the party.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.138
I had this whole plan

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:09.221
that was meant to show you that
I could be more than just an assistant,

01:32:09.315 --> 01:32:11.146
and then it totally fell apart.

01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:13.441
So...

01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:19.231
Mostly, though,
I just really wanted to say thank you.

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:22.032
'Cause I've always been
in total awe of you, grace,

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:25.783
and to be able to witness
the person that I admire the most

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:27.910
do the thing that she does best...

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:33.378
Was the greatest time of my whole life.

01:32:33.631 --> 01:32:34.746
Um...

01:32:35.675 --> 01:32:37.040
And I'm so grateful.

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:01.825
Hello?

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.866
Are you still mad at me?

01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:06.569
Yeah. But I golia talk to you
about something.

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:10.031
Well, I just wanna tell you
that I'm really sorry about everything,

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:12.959
and I really just wish we were writing.

01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:15.745
Where are you?

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.832
Well, actually, about that...

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.097
Oh, my god.

01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:36.437
What are you doing here?

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:38.359
Your roommate told me
where you were.

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.362
She was very rude. Yeah.

01:33:41.908 --> 01:33:44.991
So, do you know
where you sent my suit to be tailored?

01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:46.693
I want to wear it tomorrow.

01:33:47.705 --> 01:33:48.990
What suit?

01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:50.993
The one I wore
to Michelle's birthday.

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:54.079
Obama or Williams?

01:33:55.672 --> 01:33:57.082
I may or...

01:33:57.173 --> 01:33:58.208
Mmm.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:06.923
May not have said some things
that could have hurt someone's feelings.

01:34:07.851 --> 01:34:08.851
And...

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:11.517
For that...

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.804
I forgive myself.

01:34:15.275 --> 01:34:16.275
Yeah.

01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.061
Was that an apology?

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:19.984
Absolutely not.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.062
No. No, it wasn't.

01:34:23.283 --> 01:34:26.150
I was pissed
because you messed up,

01:34:27.203 --> 01:34:29.990
and you didn't do your job,
and what else was I supposed to do?

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:34.875
But while you were gone, I...

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:37.957
Missed you.

01:34:39.799 --> 01:34:43.883
I took having someone on my side
for granted.

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:46.093
- I'm always on...
- No, no.

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:47.921
No, no.
I have, actually, more to say.

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:50.890
I realized it's because...

01:34:52.937 --> 01:34:54.268
I trusted you.

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:58.189
And I have never trusted an assistant
like that before.

01:34:58.276 --> 01:34:59.391
Do not tell Gail.

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:03.269
But you were very good at your job.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.903
And you worked harder
than anyone else ever has,

01:35:07.994 --> 01:35:09.154
and you loved it.

01:35:10.163 --> 01:35:11.163
Which is...

01:35:11.247 --> 01:35:12.578
And you love my music.

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:15.578
And I appreciate that.

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:21.955
Well, thank you for coming
all the way here to tell me that.

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:23.881
Maggie, that's not why I came here.

01:35:24.636 --> 01:35:27.594
I came here to tell you

01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:31.013
that the work you did
on the live album was very good.

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:33.299
Really? Yes.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:35.555
I would have filled in the audience track
a bit more.

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:38.059
- And I think you overmixed in some places.
- Okay.

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:40.060
But you made me sound...

01:35:42.695 --> 01:35:44.651
Like me.

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:46.900
Me.

01:35:48.534 --> 01:35:50.490
I haven't heard her in a long time.

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:54.947
That's the sign
of a good producer.

01:35:56.918 --> 01:35:57.918
Thanks.

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:01.540
So, it's gonna be tough,
you know?

01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:07.297
Because it's really bleak out there
for middle-aged singers.

01:36:07.387 --> 01:36:09.799
And when I get there,
I'll confirm that.

01:36:10.974 --> 01:36:13.556
But for female producers... oh.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.972
I've never worked
with a female producer.

01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:18.981
Yeah.

01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:20.850
Should we give it a go?

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:26.989
Yes.

01:36:27.073 --> 01:36:28.688
Yeah? Yes.

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:31.320
I am available for that. Mm-hmm.

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:34.204
Okay.

01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:36.995
I've been writing.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:38.198
I knew it.

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.661
Do you want to hear 'em? Yes.

01:36:42.755 --> 01:36:44.120
- Now?
- So much, yeah.

it's called "new to me."

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:46.933
- One second.
- Okay.

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:49.151
Really?

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:50.569
Okay. Well, that was...

01:37:51.282 --> 01:37:52.442
Just bared my soul.

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:53.693
Hi.

01:37:53.785 --> 01:37:56.618
Before we talk,
I don't know how you did it,

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.490
but Dan deakins loves the songs.

01:37:58.581 --> 01:38:00.287
- Oh. Yeah.
- David?

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:01.490
Um, this is...

01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:03.620
- Mom?
- What are you doing here?

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:04.621
"Mom"?

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:06.077
Did you send Dan the songs?

01:38:06.172 --> 01:38:08.128
Oh, sweetheart, are you recording?

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:10.707
Sorry. Did you just call her "mom™?

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:12.133
Are you his mom?

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:13.630
Not now, Margaret.

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:15.882
Yeah, I've been working
on some stuff with Maggie.

01:38:15.973 --> 01:38:18.555
Dan showed his label the tracks,
and they wanna sign me.

01:38:19.644 --> 01:38:20.759
So, wait. You...

01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:25.980
You were working with him
while you were working for me?

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:27.398
Is this the guy... are you...

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:29.976
Is this... is this the boy?

01:38:33.866 --> 01:38:34.866
Are you two dating?

01:38:34.951 --> 01:38:35.781
No. Yeah.

01:38:35.868 --> 01:38:39.156
Hey, magpie, I got some tacos.

01:38:40.206 --> 01:38:41.946
Wow. It's...

01:38:43.418 --> 01:38:44.418
It's grace Davis.

01:38:45.002 --> 01:38:46.208
That's me.

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.414
You came on the ferry?

01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:53.545
- No, I have a helicopter.
- Wow.

01:38:53.636 --> 01:38:55.752
I do. Yeah.

01:38:55.847 --> 01:38:57.678
- I have a helicopter.
- Tell everybody.

01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:02.680
So, when you said that you and your mom
just started talking again,

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:06.854
you didn't think to tell me
that your mom is grace Davis?

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:08.727
You didn't tell me
you were working for her.

01:39:08.818 --> 01:39:09.978
Don't change the subject.

01:39:16.451 --> 01:39:17.451
We've met before.

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:23.488
1989. I interviewed you
for my radio show on k-sadj.

01:39:23.583 --> 01:39:25.665
It was in la.

01:39:25.751 --> 01:39:27.537
Yes! Downtown.

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:29.869
I can't believe you remember that.

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:31.920
Yes!

01:39:32.008 --> 01:39:33.088
Oh, my god. Wait.

01:39:33.176 --> 01:39:35.963
You had long hair.
You didn't have the beard.

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:38.044
And that voice...

01:39:38.139 --> 01:39:39.970
That's you!

01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:41.718
That was a really good show.

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.094
I think it was, yeah.

01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:44.596
And you had a pregnant wife.

01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:46.229
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:48.851
She used to help me.
And that was Maggie.

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:51.432
- What? What...
- The one inside the pregnant wife.

01:39:52.612 --> 01:39:53.943
Small world.

01:39:55.448 --> 01:39:57.939
Fucking long con.

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:05.951
I had him when I was so young.

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:10.376
And I had a chance
to change things for us,

01:40:10.463 --> 01:40:12.044
and I took it.

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:15.835
I took it.

01:40:18.888 --> 01:40:20.378
Who else knows?

01:40:26.729 --> 01:40:27.729
Gail.

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:31.768
Jack.

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:36.102
He was there when I had him.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.570
Jack's always there.

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:41.900
I just don't... how did this...

01:40:42.328 --> 01:40:45.445
I know everything about you.
I mean...

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:48.873
I have really good lawyers.
Like...

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:52.243
Damn.

01:40:52.338 --> 01:40:53.748
Are you gonna tell people?

01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:57.290
I wanted to, many times.

01:40:59.345 --> 01:41:01.131
But he said he wasn't ready.

01:41:01.973 --> 01:41:05.716
And after everything I put him through,
I respect that.

01:41:06.352 --> 01:41:08.138
I wanted to help him
with his music.

01:41:09.105 --> 01:41:13.644
But he was worried that people wouldn't
take him seriously if I was involved,

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:14.894
which I understand.

01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:18.570
It must have been
really, really hard for you.

01:41:18.656 --> 01:41:20.396
- Yeah.
- For you both. I mean...

01:41:23.035 --> 01:41:24.275
Mostly him.

01:41:26.998 --> 01:41:29.990
