00:12.920 --> 00:15.200
<i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred...</i>

00:16.760 --> 00:21.400
<i>born a Saxon and rightful heir</i>
<i>to the great fortress Bebbanburg.</i>

00:21.920 --> 00:25.000
<i>For many years,</i>
<i>I fought for King Alfred of Wessex...</i>

00:25.080 --> 00:28.040
[men yelling and screaming]

00:28.120 --> 00:32.120
<i>...and for his vision of the kingdoms</i>
<i>as a single union... England.</i>

00:33.760 --> 00:35.920
<i>But my loyalty was never rewarded.</i>

00:36.000 --> 00:37.759
You are not the best of fathers.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.000
[Uhtred] <i>My children were taken from me</i>
<i>and my son handed to the Church.</i>

00:42.840 --> 00:44.640
<i>Finally, we made peace...</i>

00:45.400 --> 00:47.760
<i>although the reconciliation was brief.</i>

00:49.000 --> 00:52.720
[Beocca] The King is dead
and so together we pray for his soul...

00:53.800 --> 00:55.440
for his successor Edward.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.120
[Uhtred] <i>The new king has much to learn.</i>

00:58.200 --> 01:00.880
Wessex appears to be
in a land of chaos and doubt.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.160
God is with us.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.960
[Uhtred ] <i>However, Alfred's widow,</i>
<i>Lady Aelswith,</i>

01:06.040 --> 01:08.360
<i>alienates men who were loyal to him.</i>

01:08.600 --> 01:13.080
You were the King’s priest
and, as such, you no longer have a role.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.160
[Uhtred] <i>And Lord Aethelhelm</i>
<i>has ambitions of his own.</i>

01:17.680 --> 01:21.920
Why was I not told
that Edward had been married previously?

01:23.240 --> 01:26.280
[Uhtred] <i>Aethelflaed's marriage</i>
<i>has also not brought harmony.</i>

01:26.960 --> 01:28.120
I want her dead.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.640
[Uhtred] <i>She holds a place</i>
<i>in my own heart.</i>

01:33.080 --> 01:36.040
<i>Brida's great love Ragnar is dead.</i>

01:37.160 --> 01:40.640
<i>She has made a new alliance</i>
<i>with the Dane Earl Cnut.</i>

01:40.720 --> 01:43.440
You should be under furs, woman, with me.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.840
And I want to enjoy all of you,
while there's time.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.440
[Uhtred] <i>Whilst the warrior Haesten</i>
<i>schemes to gain influence.</i>

01:50.640 --> 01:53.200
<i>I also have scores I must settle.</i>

01:53.840 --> 01:58.480
<i>Throughout all my victories,</i>
<i>defeats, loves and losses,</i>

01:58.560 --> 02:00.960
<i>I have stayed true to my conviction...</i>

02:01.440 --> 02:05.560
<i>that I will one day return to Bebbanburg</i>
<i>and overthrow the man</i>

02:05.640 --> 02:08.200
<i>who will stop at nothing</i>
<i>to have me killed...</i>

02:09.320 --> 02:10.920
<i>my uncle Aelfric.</i>

02:14.479 --> 02:16.160
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

02:29.360 --> 02:35.480
[men shouting and swords clanging]

02:35.560 --> 02:37.720
[grunting and weapons thudding]

02:38.640 --> 02:39.760
[screams]

02:40.720 --> 02:43.080
Bastard Scots! Kill them!

02:43.160 --> 02:46.520
[swords clanging and men shouting]

02:46.800 --> 02:49.640
Slay them all!
Don’t spare a single one of them!

02:50.040 --> 02:52.680
[grunting]

02:54.280 --> 02:55.760
Sons of whores!

02:55.840 --> 02:56.920
[screams]

02:58.240 --> 02:59.360
[screams]

03:05.680 --> 03:08.400
[screaming and yelling]

03:10.640 --> 03:12.240
[whistles]

03:13.080 --> 03:14.840
They’re weakening. Forward!

03:16.320 --> 03:18.200
[yelling]

03:28.720 --> 03:31.840
We have them! Advance!

03:32.240 --> 03:33.600
Don’t let them escape!

03:35.160 --> 03:36.240
[shouting]

03:41.560 --> 03:42.640
[screams]

03:42.720 --> 03:46.840
Advance, you cowards! Kill them all!
Do not let them escape!

03:46.920 --> 03:47.800
[screams]

03:49.240 --> 03:51.320
[grunting and screaming]

03:53.440 --> 03:55.360
[gasps] What in God’s name...

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
[yelling]

03:59.360 --> 04:00.440
Retreat!

04:00.520 --> 04:02.040
Retreat to Bebbanburg!

04:03.720 --> 04:06.120
[yelling]

04:21.640 --> 04:24.839
[yelling]

04:29.520 --> 04:30.600
Open the gates!

04:31.760 --> 04:32.960
Open the gates!

04:33.280 --> 04:34.800
Open the gates!

04:38.400 --> 04:39.240
[yelling]

04:39.320 --> 04:40.840
Go! Go!

04:42.000 --> 04:44.640
Open the gates!

04:47.600 --> 04:49.120
[swords clanging and yelling]

04:50.320 --> 04:52.240
[screaming and yelling]

05:36.000 --> 05:37.720
How many did we lose this time?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.240
Over half, Lord.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.680
Then we need more men...
or it'll be our heads on the ramparts.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.880
-Will they go back across the border?
-They'll gather reinforcements

05:49.960 --> 05:54.080
in Scotland, keep attacking
till they whittle us down to nothing.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.720
If they take Bebbanburg,
they have a gateway south.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.400
[pants]

05:59.000 --> 06:00.640
They want all of Northumbria.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.000
-Lord, where do we bury the dead?
-Leave them for the scavengers.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.120
[coughs]

06:09.760 --> 06:10.880
On your feet!

06:14.760 --> 06:16.720
The last men standing.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.760
My greatest fighters.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.920
Or the most fearful,
the ones who cowed and hid and ran?

06:28.720 --> 06:30.720
The Scots will return!

06:31.360 --> 06:34.320
They want to take our land
and see us gone.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.120
So unless you want to end up
rotting on a slave ship,

06:37.200 --> 06:40.360
I suggest you find the stomach to fight.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.600
To fight!

06:43.800 --> 06:44.680
Or leave!

06:45.880 --> 06:47.640
Go on, leave now!

06:47.720 --> 06:49.920
There is no place for doubt...

06:51.160 --> 06:52.280
or weakness.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.000
I will never surrender to invaders!

06:59.440 --> 07:03.280
[Aelfric] My men can be destroyed!
The villages starved!

07:03.360 --> 07:05.600
They can dig a trench a mile wide!

07:05.680 --> 07:09.840
But while I live,
these walls will not be breached.

07:10.160 --> 07:13.720
This fortress will not fall!

07:14.960 --> 07:21.160
I will never yield my birthright,
nor seek peace with those who attack us.

07:21.240 --> 07:25.040
We fight on, until they are all butchered.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.560
[Finan] It’s time we're heading south,
Osferth.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.320
[Aelfric] We fight on for Bebbanburg!

07:31.400 --> 07:33.080
[cheering]

07:33.680 --> 07:35.520
For Bebbanburg!

07:35.600 --> 07:37.520
[men cheering]

08:29.720 --> 08:31.480
[Aethelflaed pants]

08:59.120 --> 09:00.600
[Aethelflaed stops panting]

09:04.880 --> 09:05.720
[whispers] What?

09:07.200 --> 09:08.160
[whispers] Outside.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.120
No one knows I'm here.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.800
The people that know will not betray us.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.240
[Aethelflaed sighs]

09:20.480 --> 09:22.160
[footsteps outside]

09:23.400 --> 09:24.240
[whispers] Wait.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.800
[Aethelflaed pants]

09:26.880 --> 09:28.240
[sighs]

09:32.560 --> 09:33.480
[sighs]

09:46.720 --> 09:47.800
Who is there?

09:48.200 --> 09:52.400
It is Aldhelm. Lady Aethelflaed's absence
has been noted by her husband.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.680
She should leave here
before she is discovered.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.720
Stay with me.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.960
-I cannot.
-Yes, you can.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.280
If Aethelred sends soldiers,
we will fight them.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.600
Please, he has tortured you long enough.

10:20.480 --> 10:25.480
I know, but men should not die,
so I can love you, Uhtred.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.120
Men have died for less.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.800
Not the ones who serve me.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.080
[sighs]

10:34.800 --> 10:37.160
I will not be the cause of bloodshed.

10:38.320 --> 10:41.480
Aethelred would seek Edward's help.
We would be outnumbered.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.360
So, you'd take chastity while your husband
is chasing another woman?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.720
We both know that's different.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.920
Do not return to him and be humiliated.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.120
You are more than that.

10:58.560 --> 10:59.560
I know.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.720
And, hopefully, in time,
things will change for us.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.040
I will go to Winchester
to comfort my mother

11:08.120 --> 11:10.120
and come back here as soon as I can.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.160
Your men will return from the north soon.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.320
Lady, you know, I do not speak in envy,
but, please.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.160
Your husband would take great pleasure
in punishing you for adultery,

11:31.240 --> 11:32.480
should you give him the excuse.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.560
He takes great pleasure in punishing me
for whatever I do.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.760
So, I must try to live with
a little happiness.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.160
[Aethelflaed sighs]

11:42.560 --> 11:45.960
Besides, I have good men to protect me.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.960
And I know you do not speak from envy.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.480
[footsteps]

12:13.640 --> 12:17.080
-Any word from Finan?
-Nothing, Lord.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.520
Do you want to give up
your gods for your life?

13:17.600 --> 13:19.280
Do you want me to show you mercy?

13:20.440 --> 13:21.280
No!

13:22.360 --> 13:25.800
No. Mercy is for Christians.
What will you do?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.720
Good boy.
If they capture you, you do exactly this.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.400
[grunts]

13:35.480 --> 13:36.800
Hey, careful, Cnut!

13:38.360 --> 13:39.600
It means they like you.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.240
-They're good boys, Cnut. You're blessed.
-Yes.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.320
Come, they’ll have taken down
the camp without us.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.280
[murmuring]

14:16.200 --> 14:18.000
To the settlements until the winter.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.480
We must hide you away,
while the men go to war.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.520
Any of you caught humping a Saxon
will be executed on our return.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.760
Go!

14:48.880 --> 14:52.320
Arse-Licker.
You are the man they call the Arse-Licker?

14:52.400 --> 14:56.000
I am Eardwulf of Mercia,
commander of the King Aethelred's guard.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.040
His latest new commander.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.040
I heard you wormed your way
back from a family disgrace.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.520
And that your father lost his lands
for humping his horse?

15:04.600 --> 15:08.520
I heard there was a Dane who was willing
to betray his kinsfolk for money.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.720
[chuckles]

15:09.800 --> 15:11.720
You are steel-eyed for a turd.

15:12.560 --> 15:16.840
Perhaps we are fated to work together,
Lord Arse-Licker.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.120
[Haesten] They've been loading ships
for three days.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.440
[Eardwulf] Leaving land
they fought so hard for?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.840
It's unlike the Danes to slink away.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.560
-Where is Cnut taking his men?
-Irland.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.480
A cousin Sigtryggr is being held captive
by the natives.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.280
That will take at least a winter.
Will they come back?

15:38.360 --> 15:42.040
The women are going to local settlements,
so, there will be warm tits to return to.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.400
Why do you tell us this?

15:47.400 --> 15:51.840
Because, unlike you,
I'm not rewarded for my service.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.720
-You should have licked more asses.
-Perhaps.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.280
And...

15:59.200 --> 16:00.640
I no longer want war.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.800
I'm too old to sleep in the dirt.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.920
I want silver and Lord Aethelred has it?

16:16.720 --> 16:18.080
Makes his own coin?

16:19.040 --> 16:20.120
How ambitious.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.480
-How is the weasel?
-Still a man of wisdom and honor.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.480
Who promotes an ambitious soldier...
brave.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.880
Who rewards loyalty.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.520
-I hear he takes your sister as his whore.
-Then you heard wrong, Dane.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.360
She's not a whore
and he does not take her.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.040
[children laugh]

16:56.920 --> 16:59.320
-[Uhtred] This is good work.
-Thank you, my Lord.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.480
There's a boat down river, Lord.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.720
[Finan] Women of Coccham!

17:14.960 --> 17:17.160
We are back!

17:17.960 --> 17:20.119
[Uhtred] They know, Finan.
They can smell you from here.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.400
You look like shit.

17:25.160 --> 17:28.760
-What have you done to my ship?
-[Finan] Now, that was Osferth’s fault.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.040
-What news from Bebbanburg?
-Good news, Lord.

17:31.119 --> 17:34.280
My Uncle Aelfric is dead
and you have his balls to prove it?

17:34.360 --> 17:38.080
No, but he is being attacked
by the Scots pushing south.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.680
He lost half his men
in the most recent assault.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.160
-So, Bebbanburg's weakened?
-For now, yes.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.040
Until he finds more men.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.920
Or is slaughtered by the Scots.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.160
So, we could take it.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.720
With an army... we could take it.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.960
Well, perhaps. It will not be easy.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.000
-How many men does he have?
-Barely 40.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.320
-Can he raise a fyrd?
-Oh, God, no. Local lords think he's--

18:01.400 --> 18:03.680
That he's a turd, yes. And they're right.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.080
-We should not delay.
-No.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.560
Go before he buys more men.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.160
We head to Bebbanburg
before the Scots return.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.760
[Finan sighs]

18:14.840 --> 18:18.560
The gods are telling us to strike
and take back what is mine.

18:19.040 --> 18:23.040
Now, Lord, it'll take ships and men.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.240
The venture could cost you
all your silver.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.560
Finan, if we take Bebbanburg,

18:27.640 --> 18:29.960
we'll have all the silver
we ever dreamed of.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.920
You will all be rewarded for your service,
even you baby monk.

18:34.000 --> 18:34.960
Amen.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.200
[laughter]

18:37.280 --> 18:39.560
-How many men remain here?
-Not enough.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.360
We will ride to Winchester
and raise an army.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.360
It's time for Wessex to repay
all that I have given.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.760
What are they doing with Father's books?

19:23.840 --> 19:27.520
Lord Aethelhelm wants this room
given over to planning our defenses.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.800
Apparently,
it has the best light to work by.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.960
[Aelswith] Be careful!

19:35.640 --> 19:37.280
That is my husband's Chronicle.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.680
Take it to my quarters.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.720
His legacy, all the learning...
is no one to keep a record of our times?

19:45.800 --> 19:50.120
They keep a record...
of building fortifications.

19:50.200 --> 19:55.760
See, this one tells us how 20 men
can fashion a palisade in under a day.

19:57.720 --> 20:00.280
It is all for our own protection.

20:00.360 --> 20:04.000
-Mother, I'm so sorry.
-Please, do not pity me.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.320
I have a better life than many widows.

20:07.960 --> 20:12.640
And my new rooms are comfortable...
if rather near the kitchens.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.680
Every time I return,
there is a new insult.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.320
[Edward] I am not certain I believe it.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.760
Are the men that bring the news
to be trusted?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.040
-Lord Aethelhelm.
-My King.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.520
What did you hear?

20:33.600 --> 20:38.080
Well, simply that Cnut is leaving
for Irland to help a cousin, Sigtryggr,

20:38.160 --> 20:39.400
who's besieged there.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.920
Then it must be true. Danes are known
for their kindness and loyalty.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.560
We ignore this news
until the scouts confirm it.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.240
Continue to fortify along the border.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.400
When the Danes break the peace,
we will be ready.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.920
I will inform the whores.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.080
Quicker than the monks at spreading news.

20:55.480 --> 20:59.560
We are resolved. Every man who can wield
an ax should be building defenses.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.480
-Mother?
-What news do you talk of?

21:05.400 --> 21:07.760
Perhaps I could offer the wisdom
of experience.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.520
Take comfort that all is well.

21:11.040 --> 21:11.880
Come.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.960
[clumping of hooves]

21:29.640 --> 21:33.200
Come and lie with me, Eadith.
God wants me to be satisfied.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.560
He gave me this desire, so--

21:35.640 --> 21:38.560
So, I am sure there is a servant girl
you could hump.

21:38.640 --> 21:43.360
I've had every servant girl from here
to Ceaster. It is you that I want.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.200
And it is me you shall have...

21:46.320 --> 21:47.600
when the time is right.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.000
Come on. Do not make me force you, Eadith.
You set a man on fire.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.880
Do not be surprised when you get burned.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.640
-[knock at door]
-Yes!

21:58.440 --> 22:00.880
Lord Eardwulf, we were not expecting you
until nightfall.

22:00.960 --> 22:04.760
Forgive my intrusion, Lord, and to you,
sister, but I bring important news.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.480
-Have us brought wine.
-My Lord.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.480
-What is your news, Commander?
-I met a Danish spy and he revealed

22:11.560 --> 22:13.880
that Cnut is taking
his warriors from East Anglia

22:13.960 --> 22:18.040
and heading to Irland, leaving their women
and children in undefended settlements.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.680
-Who else knows of this?
-No one. I paid him well.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.480
-Did you see them leave?
-Yes.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.160
They're dismantling their camp
and packing their boats.

22:26.240 --> 22:27.720
A cousin is under attack in Dyflin.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.160
If they're leaving East Anglia,
then it's empty

22:30.240 --> 22:31.600
and ready for us to conquer it.

22:31.680 --> 22:35.800
And if I enlarge our land, then Mercia
no longer has to bow to Wessex and Edward.

22:35.880 --> 22:40.040
Troops can be readied when you want them,
but I would suggest that we leave quietly,

22:40.120 --> 22:43.560
-before the Ealdormen can disapprove.
-This is an excellent plan.

22:43.680 --> 22:47.240
It appears the relics of St. Oswald
are already working in my favor.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.440
I'm collecting all the bones
of our beloved Saint...

22:51.280 --> 22:52.280
as a good omen

22:52.360 --> 22:55.640
to signal to the Mercian people that
I shall restore their lands to greatness.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.240
-I'm sure they'll be impressed.
-It's my gift to the common folk.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.240
Monks are leaving imminently
with silver to bargain for his heart...

23:02.200 --> 23:04.560
and the winds are clearly blowing
in our favor.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.400
Thank you for all that you've done.
It's impressive.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.880
Anything I do, I do for Mercia.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.600
Indeed.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.160
You could teach your sister
a lesson in generosity.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.720
Our game is not finished.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.600
-Are you talking horseshit?
-No. I met a spy and the news is true.

23:28.680 --> 23:29.800
The man is inflated enough

23:29.880 --> 23:32.240
-without you encouraging him.
-I'm trying to keep him happy.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.680
As should you.
Just hump the desperate bastard.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.560
I hump him and he loses interest.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.680
If we want all this to continue,
then we must not overplay our hand.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.880
Do you want to return to being landless
and ridiculed?

23:42.760 --> 23:46.080
-You hump him, if you do not believe me.
-I tried. He did not bite.

23:49.040 --> 23:49.920
[both chuckle]

23:57.040 --> 23:59.480
Will you hurry, Sable!

23:59.560 --> 24:00.960
Ah, the monks.

24:01.040 --> 24:05.920
I'll fetch your silver.
You leave for Northumbria immediately.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.520
St. Oswald’s heart? Bloody long way to go
for a piece of dried offal.

24:10.800 --> 24:14.240
Still, a few taverns
to stop at along the way.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.480
Northumbria’s a piss-hole place
to waste a journey on.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.080
[low murmuring]

24:24.160 --> 24:25.360
[sighs]

24:26.640 --> 24:29.200
-Did you meet this Arse-Licker?
-I did.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.160
Word will spread
that you leave for Irland.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.600
And he believed you?

24:33.680 --> 24:37.480
He wants to kiss his master's backside.
He believes what he wants to hear.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.520
Then we shall attack Mercia,
while their backs are turned.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.040
We sail to the estuary before dawn,
head upstream

24:44.120 --> 24:46.320
and keep the boats apart
to avoid any scouts.

24:46.400 --> 24:49.400
When we reach Mercia,
we assault Aegelesburg in two bands

24:49.480 --> 24:51.200
and I will kill their little Lord.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.160
Too timid to attack
the boy king in Wessex?

24:55.400 --> 24:59.560
The boy king in Wessex
has been building defenses.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.000
And the fool in Mercia
has been following his cock.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.200
[Cnut chuckles]

25:03.280 --> 25:06.480
We kill Aethelred, Wessex is honor-bound
to come to Mercia's aid.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.560
We lure out Edward
from behind his walls...

25:10.120 --> 25:13.280
and fight on our terms
and take the country.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.440
As so many others have failed to do.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.960
[men laugh in background]

25:24.600 --> 25:26.160
What did you do to tame her?

25:27.720 --> 25:30.720
I treated her with respect
and gave her love.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.680
[mocking grunt]

25:34.120 --> 25:36.320
After you slaughtered the man
she cared for.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.440
I pity the bitch.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.720
Do not give me a reason to kill you.

25:45.880 --> 25:46.800
My friend.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.000
All right.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.720
[knock at door]

26:10.800 --> 26:11.640
Yes.

26:11.720 --> 26:12.920
[door opens]

26:14.240 --> 26:17.120
I hear Uhtred is downstairs.
Were you expecting him?

26:17.720 --> 26:19.920
Uhtred? No, not until summer.

26:20.560 --> 26:21.680
Are you sure it's him?

26:22.200 --> 26:24.800
From the reaction of the novices,
I'm fairly certain.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.280
-Beocca!
-[Beocca laughs]

26:29.360 --> 26:30.960
[laughs] Hild!

26:32.040 --> 26:33.880
You have made quite an impression.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.680
And you have not changed.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.880
He has.
Are you still writing this great work?

26:40.960 --> 26:43.440
St. Cuthbert is capricious.
He eludes me daily.

26:43.520 --> 26:44.920
A master takes his time.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.920
-You look like a man with good news.
-I am.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.200
And we will need to sit for it
and we will need wine.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.640
It is indeed worth waiting for.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.920
Aelfric will finally see a reckoning.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.480
Yes, never has a man deserved it more.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.640
He is now weakened and without allies.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.240
-Has he no heir to assist him?
-He did.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.840
A son...
but the heir Wihtgar was banished.

27:09.080 --> 27:12.480
-He died last summer in the southern sea.
-You can starve him out.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.880
Surround the fortress.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.000
What was your plan?

27:19.480 --> 27:21.160
My plan is that you join us...

27:22.400 --> 27:23.480
both of you.

27:25.040 --> 27:29.000
Oh, I think my fighting days are over,
Uhtred.

27:31.680 --> 27:32.640
You, then?

27:35.080 --> 27:37.760
-You don't want an old man.
-Beocca, you're not old.

27:40.720 --> 27:45.240
And you have mourned Thyra long enough.
She would not want this sadness for you.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.480
Throw it off and return to Bebbanburg
with me.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.800
I cannot.

27:54.880 --> 27:59.000
Without me, the nuns would have
no one to minister the sacraments.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.800
And the life of St. Cuthbert
will not write itself.

28:01.880 --> 28:05.040
Take the fortress. I will join you,
when the hard work is done.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.960
Then we will hold a feast there
in your honor.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.480
You deserve to go back, Uhtred.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.440
Yes, to restore your family
to their rightful place.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.520
I want to make a home
for my children to return to.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.440
-Are they well? Your children?
-Stiorra thrives.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.720
She lives at Aethelflaed's estate.

28:29.360 --> 28:33.600
My son, I do not see.
Alfred's influence has made him holy.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.640
What news of Wessex?

28:40.240 --> 28:42.960
Wessex... thrives.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.640
Defenses are being strengthened
against the Danes.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.880
Edward's son is now walking.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.040
The King's wife is to be crowned a queen.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.880
It is unusual to honor the girl,
whilst the widow Aelswith lives,

28:56.840 --> 28:57.760
to say the least.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.680
But Aelflaed has an ambitious father.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.960
Yes, Lord Aethelhelm is ambitious.

29:05.480 --> 29:09.520
But King Edward just accepts this ambition
from an Ealdorman?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.800
Let's just say
we feel his father's absence.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.560
[door opens]

29:42.280 --> 29:43.680
[Pyrlig whispers]

29:49.600 --> 29:52.280
Finish your prayers.
It is nothing of concern.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.320
[laughs]

30:05.840 --> 30:08.040
Walking like a fat man, friend.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.880
It is my massive balls, Uhtred.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.920
Too much palace food
and sitting on your backside.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.280
-Perhaps. I fight less than I did.
-There will be fighting yet.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.000
Do you know something we do not,
Lord Uhtred?

30:19.080 --> 30:21.640
Lord King. Steapa.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.240
I only know that Danes do not like peace.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.800
Did you hear Cnut is now heading
to Irland to rescue a cousin?

30:28.880 --> 30:31.800
No. I heard he has brought his sons
over from his homeland,

30:31.880 --> 30:33.640
which means he has ambition here.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.680
And what brings you to Winchester?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.240
I'm here to make you an offer.

30:42.360 --> 30:45.720
I can help you fulfill your father's dream
of a united land...

30:47.200 --> 30:49.560
if you give me men to retake Bebbanburg.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.640
Is Uhtred Ragnarson trying to negotiate?

30:55.640 --> 30:56.960
It is a good idea.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.800
If the bastard Scots
are making incursions,

30:58.880 --> 31:00.320
they will return in number.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.000
He takes the fortress.
It becomes your foothold in Northumbria.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.640
I take Northumbria
and I unite the four kingdoms.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.680
Small matter of conquering East Anglia,

31:08.760 --> 31:11.760
but that is mainly cattle
and people that look like cattle.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.880
Your father knew it could be done,
one country, one king.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.800
Since when have you cared
for my father's vision, Uhtred?

31:18.880 --> 31:22.040
Since it coincided with what he wants,
by the sound of it.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.800
It works for the both of us.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.920
Unless you want the Scots to gain
a stronghold to attack you from?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.480
Aelfric cannot hold them off like I can.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.960
I control the fortress.
You control the country.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.800
Give me 100 men, it will take a week.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.960
Two hundred, I can take it in a day--

31:37.040 --> 31:39.800
It would certainly fulfill an ambition.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.480
But given the ongoing threat
from the Danes here in the south,

31:43.560 --> 31:46.200
is it wise to distract ourselves...

31:46.760 --> 31:51.080
gallop to the frozen north for what is,
in essence, a family feud?

31:51.160 --> 31:53.920
Uhtred has done much to distract
the Danes from Wessex.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.600
Yes and we are all very grateful
for his service.

31:58.240 --> 32:01.720
But surely his oath was to see
the King on the throne.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.360
A duty that is now performed.

32:03.440 --> 32:05.480
What is the point you are making,
Lord Aethelhelm?

32:05.560 --> 32:09.200
I'm merely saying that
there is no debt on either side.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.560
-No debt--
-Lord Uhtred is free...

32:11.960 --> 32:13.320
to take what he wants.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.480
You to defend what you have...

32:16.280 --> 32:20.240
which is the innocent people of Wessex
from the marauding heathen.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.040
By cowering behind walls
and waiting for the Danes to attack?

32:23.120 --> 32:26.760
No, by not being forced to fight
before we are certain to win.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.840
There are good reasons
to go softly and strategically.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.960
That is how you got where you are,
Lord Aethelhelm.

32:32.040 --> 32:35.640
Lord, take this moment
your God is offering you.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.120
Your father had a dream--

32:37.200 --> 32:41.600
And my father also knew
when to say no to Uhtred Ragnarson.

32:42.480 --> 32:46.200
I am no longer the boy
who can be bent to your will.

32:48.440 --> 32:51.400
This is not saying never,
but now is not the time.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.400
[Uhtred] "Now is not the time."

33:11.040 --> 33:14.320
Years, I've waited.
Years, I've given my sword.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.600
Years, my home has been denied to me.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.800
"There's no debt."

33:17.880 --> 33:19.720
Winchester is a snake pit.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.640
We will think of another plan.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.760
Do you think our band can take
the 40 men at Bebbanburg?

33:32.840 --> 33:36.640
-Two on one? Ask me when I'm drunk.
-Come on, Finan.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.720
Our men are three times
the fighters Aelfric's are.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.800
I know. It's just unbreachable walls
and boiling tar that worry me.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.280
Not to mention the Scots
waiting to take it for themselves.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.280
Is the plan off, then?

33:50.880 --> 33:52.520
Are we just staying here to get drunk?

33:52.600 --> 33:55.320
The plan is unchanged.
We head to Bebbanburg.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.640
Take the fortress, then we get drunk.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.480
Just us...

34:04.040 --> 34:05.040
without an army?

34:05.120 --> 34:09.280
You don't need an army to kill one man.
We kill Aelfric, the gates will open.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.920
-None, Aidan?
-None, Lord. We have tried.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.800
Offer them three times
what a mercenary would normally receive.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.360
I do not think silver will tempt them.

34:24.920 --> 34:28.600
-Are they afraid of the Scots?
-No, but they think that we are doomed.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.880
There is another way,
but you will not like it.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.400
We have had word that Aethelred
of Mercia is sending monks--

34:38.480 --> 34:40.159
What does that turd want with us?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.880
The heart of St. Oswald.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.040
I know it is a precious relic and that
it has been at Bebbanburg for generations,

34:48.120 --> 34:49.679
but it may be our only course.

34:49.760 --> 34:54.040
Aidan, I am a devoted Christian,
who fears his saints.

34:54.120 --> 34:58.920
Bebbanburg was my reward from God
for my constant and unwavering piety.

34:59.560 --> 35:00.800
Yes, indeed.

35:01.639 --> 35:04.480
Send out to whatever hovels
the common people live in.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.960
Round up the farmers' sons.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.600
Will that work, Lord?
The farmers are not well-disposed to us.

35:09.680 --> 35:13.080
It will work if you hold a knife
to the mothers' throats.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.920
-Look around you, Eardwulf.
-Lord?

36:00.560 --> 36:04.120
Soon, all that you see
will belong to Mercia.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.240
Cnut's mistake for leaving
will be our glory.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.800
It's getting in to Bebbanburg,
that's the problem.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.080
I say we just turn up and ram the gate.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.960
Or we just ask nicely to be let in.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.400
Next idea.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.680
-We are not dressing up as nuns.
-I wasn't going to say that.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.720
-But you were.
-No, I wasn't.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.040
Lord Uhtred!

36:35.680 --> 36:38.400
Thank you for offering your men
to clear the stables.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.320
What!

36:40.200 --> 36:42.400
Lady Aethelflaed will meet you
in the garden.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.880
Do not turn me into a brothel-keeper.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.320
-Oh, but you enjoy the savage life.
-Uhtred!

36:48.560 --> 36:50.120
Do your novices not know that?

36:52.600 --> 36:53.480
Ladders.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.880
-Lord Uhtred.
-Lady Aethelflaed.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.880
Forgive me for not meeting you
at the palace.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.600
My woman Sable is at my husband's estate.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.760
And she has learned something
that will be very useful to you.

37:30.720 --> 37:35.200
[Sable] It is all being done very quickly
and I am not one to spy or spread rumors.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.080
But Lord Aethelred is collecting
the relics of St. Oswald.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.320
Why is this important?

37:41.880 --> 37:45.480
Because, when St. Oswald's body
is reunited in Mercia,

37:45.560 --> 37:47.600
the land will be returned to greatness.

37:47.680 --> 37:51.120
-It is important to our people.
-Why is it important to me?

37:51.200 --> 37:54.360
-Tell him of the monks, Sable.
-Oh, yes.

37:54.440 --> 37:57.600
All that remains to be gathered
is the heart of St. Oswald,

37:57.680 --> 37:59.000
-which your uncle--
-Of course.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.720
Aelfric keeps it at Bebbanburg.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.800
It's no doubt some dog liver
my ancestors bought.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.880
Nevertheless, a treasure to the Mercians.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.760
Lord Aethelred has sent a pair of monks
up north to strike a bargain for it.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.080
Do you know when?

38:14.160 --> 38:17.840
They should reach Grimesby by Sunday,
then Bebbanburg on the day of Ascension.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.520
-When is Ascension?
-Ten days before Pentecost.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.360
Two weeks from now.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.560
Intercept these brothers

38:26.640 --> 38:28.840
and you could gain entry
into the fortress.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.040
I will need a priest
who can accompany these monks.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.320
I am sorry,
but I can provide nothing more.

38:38.280 --> 38:39.760
I cannot defy my brother.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.080
I hope your brother values your loyalty.

38:42.960 --> 38:45.040
I hope you win what you have longed for.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.240
Uhtred...

38:53.480 --> 38:54.960
What if you die doing this?

38:59.160 --> 39:02.720
Then you will be the last woman
to hump Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.040
[laughs]

39:07.040 --> 39:09.240
Is that your way of promising
to be faithful?

39:11.120 --> 39:12.320
Do not answer that.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.160
[Uhtred] If we leave now, we should
make it to the monastery by nightfall.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.040
We will need another beast, a small one.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.480
Hump the horseman's wife if you have to.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.640
I'd rather hump the horse.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.440
-[Finan] Why the extra horse, Lord?
-It's for a priest.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.080
-Which priest?
-One I hope will be glad to see me.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.680
Well, well.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.800
Finally back to Bebbanburg.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.480
Beocca...

39:55.320 --> 39:57.520
if you want to come,
I will carry you there.

39:59.080 --> 40:01.480
Ride with me.
We will rest when you need to.

40:01.560 --> 40:05.360
-I will fight with you on my shoulders.
-You do not need me for this, Uhtred.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.040
You're ready to face this alone.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.360
Fulfill your father's birthright.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.840
Restore Northumbria to greatness.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.800
The pride should be on your shoulders
and yours alone.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.360
You deserve this.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.600
I will repay all the debt I owe you
three times over.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.880
You will live like a lord in Bebbanburg.

40:24.960 --> 40:26.360
You owe me nothing, Uhtred.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.120
Anything I ever did for you,
I did from my own heart.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.320
May the Lord bless you and keep you
in this adventure.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.200
Thank you, Father.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.360
Goodbye, pure and holy abbess.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.520
[chuckles]
Goodbye, you bloodthirsty heathen.

40:51.120 --> 40:52.000
Take this.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.840
Turn it into hack-silver
and pay for bribes along the way.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.320
Keep each other out of trouble.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.640
[flutter of bird wings]

42:26.960 --> 42:30.480
[men shouting in distance]

42:30.560 --> 42:33.040
[hooves thundering and yelling]

42:33.120 --> 42:34.480
[gasps]

42:34.560 --> 42:36.280
[soldier] Kill them all!

42:38.640 --> 42:41.120
[people screaming]

42:41.200 --> 42:42.600
[pants]

42:42.680 --> 42:46.000
[people screaming]

42:53.480 --> 42:59.080
[soldiers shouting]

43:21.320 --> 43:22.360
[gasps]

43:25.640 --> 43:27.840
No! No!

43:27.920 --> 43:28.920
[sobs]

43:29.000 --> 43:30.400
-[footsteps]
-[gasps]

43:52.720 --> 43:56.040
Look how he worms his way in,
with the King's guard.

43:57.240 --> 43:59.840
Why do that if you do not seek influence?

44:00.880 --> 44:02.400
I do not trust him.

44:02.880 --> 44:07.720
In the past, he has suggested to me
things that are most unchristian,

44:07.800 --> 44:10.000
in regards to the other heirs
to the throne.

44:11.040 --> 44:15.200
Do you mean the firstborn you had banished
so your son could make a better marriage?

44:16.920 --> 44:21.040
I mean the children
who were conceived without holy union.

44:21.120 --> 44:22.880
The first marriage was legitimate.

44:25.480 --> 44:28.120
There are priests
who will swear on the Book to it.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.760
Lady...

44:31.920 --> 44:34.680
you chose Lord Aethelhelm's daughter
as a match,

44:34.760 --> 44:37.440
because he had silver that Wessex needed.

44:38.040 --> 44:42.520
You chose her over a woman your son
loved and who had borne him children.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.920
You cannot invite a serpent
into the garden

44:45.000 --> 44:47.360
and be surprised
when it slithers on the ground.

44:49.480 --> 44:52.640
Did I not have you removed
from the court, Father Beocca?

44:52.720 --> 44:55.440
Yes, another one of your rash judgments.

44:55.520 --> 44:59.280
It is unwise to remain somewhere
you are not wanted.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.600
And yet you choose to stay here, too.

45:02.880 --> 45:04.480
Perhaps we are not so different.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.640
[Hild] This bitterness is not her.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.120
Her role is diminished
and she is veiled in grief.

45:22.240 --> 45:23.200
Yes.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.440
It can make a person
less than they should be.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.600
I should know.

45:46.640 --> 45:49.280
Seize the land to the north
until you reach the sea.

45:50.920 --> 45:53.640
And then we will see which Saxon kingdom
is the greatest.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.160
And who should kneel to whom.

46:13.920 --> 46:15.040
[Finan] Which one?

46:17.800 --> 46:19.160
[Sihtric] It's not him.

46:27.520 --> 46:28.600
[Finan] It's him. Go!

46:33.120 --> 46:34.400
[Young Uhtred grunts]

46:34.480 --> 46:38.120
-Hey! Get off! Who are you!
-He's a sinner, Father!

46:38.280 --> 46:39.880
[Young Uhtred] Where are we going?

46:45.840 --> 46:46.800
[grunts and pants]

46:49.880 --> 46:50.840
[pants]

46:55.440 --> 46:59.400
-Hello, Father.
-Men, this is my son. Young Uhtred.

46:59.480 --> 47:02.480
I don't use that name.
It belongs to a priest killer.

47:06.120 --> 47:07.800
I'm here to guide you back to your family.

47:07.880 --> 47:09.000
The Church is my family.

47:09.080 --> 47:11.120
It's not. You were placed there
without my permission.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.200
Praise be to King Alfred for that.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.880
We are leaving this place
and you are coming with me.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.280
-Am I?
-Yes, you have no choice.

47:21.360 --> 47:24.320
Take off the woman's garb. Wear this.

47:25.480 --> 47:28.520
And, uh... I have a gift for you.

47:30.040 --> 47:30.880
Sihtric!

47:33.760 --> 47:35.760
[horse grunts and whinnies]

47:44.040 --> 47:45.360
Impressive beast.

47:48.800 --> 47:52.600
Hey.
I did not realize how much you'd grown.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.600
Ride to Coccham with us.
In time, we will find you a proper horse.

47:59.680 --> 48:00.880
Why would I go to Coccham?

48:00.960 --> 48:02.960
To collect the ship
that will take us north...

48:03.440 --> 48:05.400
to reclaim your birthright and mine.

48:07.680 --> 48:10.160
To seize back what was lost
and unite our family.

48:10.760 --> 48:13.400
-I'm taking you to Bebbanburg.
-Never heard of it.

48:23.320 --> 48:26.840
-He doesn't seem to like you much.
-That's Alfred's legacy.

48:28.640 --> 48:30.080
The man torments me still.

48:45.480 --> 48:47.680
Let me guess. I'm to be banished again.

48:47.760 --> 48:51.520
Would I let that happen, Beocca?
I would say keep yourself indoors a while.

48:52.120 --> 48:53.360
I am to be silenced.

48:54.240 --> 48:57.240
I'm sorry.
Lady Aelswith wields power where she can.

48:58.240 --> 49:01.160
I will drop in and bring you news
until she has calmed herself.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.200
You are a good man, Father Pyrlig.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.560
A good friend to me and to Wessex.

49:11.720 --> 49:12.720
Before you go...

49:16.640 --> 49:19.800
to advise a king is a great honor.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.000
But it can also be a curse.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.720
Sometimes found myself at war
with my own conscience.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.240
-I want you to know you have my blessing.
-To do what?

49:32.320 --> 49:34.680
Whatever must be done
to protect King Edward.

49:36.840 --> 49:40.280
Ah. The King grows wiser by the day, true.

49:41.680 --> 49:44.040
He has all the makings of a great leader,
I'm sure.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.200
But time may be against you.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.880
Those around him have ambition.

49:49.960 --> 49:55.760
And it is not the ambition of the King,
or of his father, who we both loved.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.640
So, you do what you must.

50:22.280 --> 50:23.320
It's sturdy enough.

50:24.320 --> 50:27.560
Do we not need something more... agile?

50:29.400 --> 50:31.600
We're not taking pelts to sell to Frankia.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.560
Do you want Aelfric to know
that we're coming?

50:35.960 --> 50:37.200
I suppose not.

50:38.280 --> 50:39.520
Pelts it is.

50:44.280 --> 50:45.400
Uhtred!

50:49.880 --> 50:50.720
Beocca?

50:52.920 --> 50:54.720
Are you kidding? [chuckles]

50:55.280 --> 50:59.560
Do you have room for half a man more?
I flee the wrath of the Lady Aelswith.

50:59.640 --> 51:03.080
As do we all.
I'm sure we can make space for you.

51:03.720 --> 51:06.840
I'm afraid I'll be not much use to you
as a fighter.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.120
Happily for you, I am desperate.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.320
[Beocca laughs]

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
[Finan] We'll require more ale, for sure.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.440
Did Hild send you to keep an eye on me?

51:20.000 --> 51:20.920
No.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.920
It was entirely my decision.

51:26.800 --> 51:29.200
You were right. I've allowed myself
to get old too quickly.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.840
I shall leech off their youthfulness...

51:34.040 --> 51:35.320
revive myself.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.520
[Finan chuckles]

51:39.520 --> 51:40.800
What is the real reason?

51:43.640 --> 51:45.520
Word reached me...

51:47.440 --> 51:50.600
of the abduction of a young deacon.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.400
So, I felt I should, uh...

51:56.240 --> 51:57.800
[Uhtred sighs]

51:57.880 --> 51:59.960
You came to help me be a better father.

52:01.480 --> 52:02.800
Well, there is that.

52:03.880 --> 52:04.720
[Uhtred] And?

52:37.120 --> 52:38.920
Come, get on the boat with us.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.600
What use do you have for me?

52:42.040 --> 52:44.480
Why do you drag me to something
for which I'm not made?

52:45.080 --> 52:48.320
Because I see the man that you will be,
not the boy that you are.

52:54.640 --> 52:57.720
I know what it is to be ripped
from one life to live another.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.200
And I know that it will make you stronger.

53:02.240 --> 53:03.920
Perhaps my faith is being tested.

53:05.760 --> 53:07.880
-Perhaps that's what it is.
-You see this?

53:10.320 --> 53:11.640
This was my father's.

53:12.920 --> 53:14.400
One day it will be yours.

53:15.720 --> 53:18.120
-It is fate.
-It doesn't feel like fate.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.080
It feels like penance.

53:44.720 --> 53:46.800
[Finan] Get your saintly arse
on the bench, Osferth.

53:46.880 --> 53:49.680
-[Uhtred] Let's go.
-He gets sick traveling backward.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.280
[Osferth] I do not.
I just like to see where we’re going.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.560
[Sihtric laughs]

54:43.160 --> 54:44.800
To Bebbanburg!

54:45.760 --> 54:46.800
Raise the sail!
