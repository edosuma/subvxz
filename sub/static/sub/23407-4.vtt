00:06.030 --> 00:07.642
What's in that box, huh?

00:07.671 --> 00:09.161
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, babe.

00:09.197 --> 00:10.896
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:11.113 --> 00:12.283
Oh.

00:12.408 --> 00:13.426
Looking good.

00:13.698 --> 00:15.116
- Who, me?
- Yeah. You.

00:15.143 --> 00:16.280
- Oh, thank you.
- You.

00:16.335 --> 00:17.468
Psst!

00:21.356 --> 00:23.464
- I need to talk to you.
- Yeah? What is it?

00:23.673 --> 00:25.396
You know what I want to talk about...

00:25.521 --> 00:28.989
- That doggone laundromat.
- Oh, yeah. This is nice, ain't it?

00:30.349 --> 00:33.073
Are you kidding, nice?

00:33.131 --> 00:36.233
- Joann, you lied to me.
- No, I did not.

00:36.256 --> 00:38.703
Curtis, take that box
in the kitchen, please.

00:39.059 --> 00:42.537
Ugh. This is coming to life.

00:43.302 --> 00:44.664
Curtis.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.830
- Yeah?
- I didn't even know those were windows.

00:47.859 --> 00:50.194
Yeah. I know. I know,
baby. I didn't either.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.817
Yeah. A lot of dirt will do that.

00:54.644 --> 00:57.902
Well, thank you. Thank
you both. This is so good.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.584
Thank you, Joann. Thank you, Ryan.

00:59.613 --> 01:01.305
Baby, doesn't this look nice?

01:01.317 --> 01:03.233
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They doing good. Yeah.

01:03.245 --> 01:05.594
I think this is... this
is... this is coming to life.

01:05.617 --> 01:08.507
It's looking, like, it's looking
better. It's looking better.

01:09.181 --> 01:11.034
I got the pipes cleaned
out in the kitchen.

01:11.098 --> 01:12.934
I knew you'd come in handy.

01:14.373 --> 01:16.526
And all that dust behind the stove,

01:16.561 --> 01:20.262
I hope it was dust, reminds
me of the laundromat.

01:21.701 --> 01:25.156
Curtis, hey. When am I going
to get to see the laundromat?

01:25.668 --> 01:27.579
Oh. Yeah, baby. You'll see it.

01:27.602 --> 01:29.479
But, I mean, you got so much here.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.996
- You got to paint the walls. You still got to...
- Well, that's okay.

01:32.036 --> 01:34.304
... still got to dust all
that stuff, put all that stuff.

01:34.759 --> 01:37.016
Well, Curtis, as soon
as we take a break,

01:37.338 --> 01:39.245
we can go on over there.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.300
Okay.

01:41.784 --> 01:43.171
How far away is it?

01:43.356 --> 01:45.626
- Oh, babe, that's way... We got to go way...
- It's not that far.

01:48.124 --> 01:49.166
Ow.

01:50.415 --> 01:51.806
- What?
- Thank you.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.018
- You don't want her to know?
- No.

01:53.020 --> 01:54.080
Why?

01:54.562 --> 01:57.419
I don't want her to see
it until we clean it up.

01:57.431 --> 01:58.927
Oh, well, she's never going to see it.

02:02.013 --> 02:03.667
Excuse me. You're
just who I need to see.

02:03.676 --> 02:04.961
Can I see you in the backyard, please?

02:04.970 --> 02:06.733
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course. Oh, sure.

02:06.738 --> 02:08.068
You know you're married, right, Curtis?

02:08.529 --> 02:10.178
You know we're cousins, right?

02:42.802 --> 02:46.602
You told me that laundromat
made $8,000 a month.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.867
- Well, it did.
- When?

02:48.913 --> 02:51.230
One month back in 1987.

02:53.329 --> 02:55.168
It was after the hurricane!

02:55.200 --> 02:56.950
There were no other laundromats working.

02:56.978 --> 02:59.004
We were doing business around the clock.

02:59.008 --> 03:00.822
I want to... I want to choke you.

03:01.771 --> 03:04.815
- Ooh. Yeah. Really?
- Joann!

03:04.876 --> 03:07.667
Oh. Well, why? Why do
you want to choke me?

03:07.792 --> 03:09.169
Because you lied to me.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.980
You told me the business made
all... Did all that business.

03:12.003 --> 03:13.922
- This laundromat supposed to do so much business.
- It can.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.430
Curtis, it can.

03:16.085 --> 03:18.592
You just got to... you
got to put some love in it.

03:19.849 --> 03:21.967
There ain't that much love in the world.

03:23.984 --> 03:25.509
Ain't much love in your heart,

03:26.637 --> 03:28.793
but it's in the world.

03:35.545 --> 03:37.389
- I want my money back.
- I can't do that.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.451
We're going to keep this house,

03:40.483 --> 03:42.551
but you're going to give me my
money back for that laundromat.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.674
- You heard me.
- Well... well, I'm sorry.

03:44.693 --> 03:46.309
Sorry ain't kicking it, lady.

03:46.365 --> 03:47.765
Lady?

03:48.705 --> 03:50.022
Lady, we cousin.

03:51.412 --> 03:53.830
- You know what the last word in cousins is?
- Huh?

03:53.849 --> 03:55.060
Sins.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.259
Which is what I'm about to commit.

04:02.055 --> 04:03.497
Uh, uh.

04:04.971 --> 04:07.863
Oh, look. I'm sorry. I'm... I...

04:07.914 --> 04:10.701
Well, no. I'm sorry, Curtis. I'm
sorry. You get it up and running.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.861
You'll thank me. You... you will.

04:17.540 --> 04:18.603
I hate you.

04:19.521 --> 04:20.548
Cousin?

04:21.589 --> 04:23.127
Get your hands off me.

04:29.176 --> 04:31.009
Hey, hey, hey. Do you
know what you're doing?

04:31.078 --> 04:32.823
- Yes, ma'am.
- What did he get on the couch?

04:32.841 --> 04:33.993
Nothing.

04:34.730 --> 04:36.512
Don't get nothing on
the couch, on the seat,

04:36.522 --> 04:38.766
- sofa, whatever that thing is.
- I won't get the pipe dirty.

04:39.514 --> 04:42.059
Wow, wow, wow wow, wow, wow

04:42.295 --> 04:45.806
- Wow? Wow, what, baby?
- Nothing.

04:46.008 --> 04:49.054
- No. Well, why are you saying "wow"?
- Yes.

04:50.171 --> 04:51.927
- You like it, don't you?
- Curtis.

04:52.146 --> 04:54.311
Baby, come on. You like it.

04:54.334 --> 04:56.367
- Come on. Go on somewhere.
- Go on. Admit it. Go on.

04:56.378 --> 04:58.779
- Admit it, baby.
- Go on somewhere.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.736
You like it, don't you?

05:01.691 --> 05:05.071
And do I know my baby,
or do I know my baby?

05:06.735 --> 05:09.153
- You still shouldn't have bought this house.
- I know I shouldn't have bought it,

05:09.165 --> 05:11.030
- but now, baby, you know I know.
- Right.

05:11.957 --> 05:13.471
I... I know, baby,

05:14.174 --> 05:15.561
but you do like it.

05:16.868 --> 05:18.440
It's growing on me.

05:18.565 --> 05:19.839
I knew it!

05:19.964 --> 05:22.850
I knew it, baby. Now go and admit it.

05:22.861 --> 05:25.145
- Go and admit it.
- You go on and clean up.

05:25.168 --> 05:26.720
Go on and clean up.

05:30.737 --> 05:32.216
Okay, Curtis.

05:33.482 --> 05:35.588
I kind of like this place.

05:36.278 --> 05:38.296
I knew you'd like it a lot, too!

05:40.521 --> 05:41.654
Ah!

05:42.142 --> 05:43.193
Oh.

05:43.391 --> 05:46.071
- You can thank me later.
- Oh, please.

05:46.296 --> 05:48.776
Thank you. You better be
glad I'm not divorcing you.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.303
Please, woman, you ain't
going to divorce me.

05:55.143 --> 05:56.565
- If you thought...
- I've been putting it down.

05:56.576 --> 05:58.407
Let me say something.
You try this again here.

06:00.572 --> 06:04.497
You try this again, and
C want to be the big D.

06:05.378 --> 06:08.263
You like this house, and you like me.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.904
And I can't wait to see the laundromat.

06:17.922 --> 06:19.363
Yeah.

06:19.593 --> 06:21.994
- Am I going to like it, too?
- Yeah.

06:22.052 --> 06:23.542
- Curtis.
- Yeah.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.247
Come on. You heard me. Is it nice?

06:25.431 --> 06:27.987
It's nice. You're going to love
it, real nice. Wait till you...

06:29.650 --> 06:31.432
Ah, Curtis.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.644
Pressure.

06:33.491 --> 06:34.799
I can't wait to see it.

06:34.850 --> 06:37.659
- I can't wait to see it!
- Now, baby, now, why don't...

06:37.677 --> 06:39.856
Don't get y'all excited. Don't get
all excited. You're going to see it.

06:40.888 --> 06:43.205
I'm just... I'm so tired
right now. I'm so tired.

06:43.702 --> 06:45.774
I still got to watch
you do all this stuff,

06:46.433 --> 06:47.530
and I got to watch you paint.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.560
- I got to watch you put the tables together.
- Curtis,

06:50.514 --> 06:52.348
you are always tired.

06:54.558 --> 06:55.932
Not always.

06:58.836 --> 07:02.101
Speaking of tired, that laundromat,
that's tired. That's some...

07:02.543 --> 07:04.068
- All right.
- Fine.

07:04.510 --> 07:06.790
Then we'll just see it tomorrow.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.995
Speaking of tomorrow,

07:09.120 --> 07:11.265
I want you to know I would
like to come over to the church

07:11.293 --> 07:14.705
- and work with the kids.
- Ooh. I'm so glad to hear you say that.

07:14.719 --> 07:16.322
Oh, I've been short of help.

07:16.349 --> 07:17.874
- Nyla is not there?
- No.

07:17.883 --> 07:19.398
She hasn't been there for three days.

07:19.416 --> 07:20.821
- What?
- No.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.707
- Well, where is she?
- Well, I...

07:22.708 --> 07:24.378
- I'm not sure.
- Did she call you?

07:24.442 --> 07:25.887
Um, she left a message saying

07:25.900 --> 07:27.646
that she wouldn't be able
to come in for awhile.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.221
- Joann.
- What?

07:31.321 --> 07:32.344
What?

07:32.827 --> 07:34.965
- Where does she live?
- Um,

07:35.439 --> 07:37.396
- I'm not sure.
- You don't know?

07:37.622 --> 07:39.234
- No, I don't.
- Okay. Listen.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.100
You know the man, Kendrick,
that she lives with?

07:41.118 --> 07:42.660
- Do you know him?
- Yes. He's a member of the church.

07:42.693 --> 07:43.932
- Well, can you get his address?
- Yes.

07:43.955 --> 07:45.810
- They live together.
- Yes.

07:49.809 --> 07:51.241
You know, something is wrong.

07:51.254 --> 07:52.535
- You think?
- Yes.

07:52.604 --> 07:55.271
When I was there, he had hit her.

07:55.326 --> 07:56.979
- What? What?
- He had hit her. Yes, yes.

07:56.997 --> 07:59.189
I didn't see it, but
she had a busted lip,

07:59.203 --> 08:01.515
- and she was all black and blue, yes.
- Oh.

08:01.534 --> 08:03.330
Oh, oh, oh. That's not good.

08:03.928 --> 08:05.329
I know it's not good,

08:05.384 --> 08:07.619
but you're doing something extra.

08:09.474 --> 08:10.672
Now wait a minute.

08:11.137 --> 08:12.712
Why are you saying it's not good?

08:12.744 --> 08:15.364
Well, that... that
Kendrick is... is the...

08:15.549 --> 08:18.468
Joann, Kendrick is... is the what?

08:20.605 --> 08:24.782
His daddy holds the mortgage to
the church and our new building.

08:25.234 --> 08:26.261
What?

08:26.270 --> 08:28.711
Yes, and I can't go over
there and upset them.

08:28.738 --> 08:31.970
- I mean, I have to keep...
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

08:32.095 --> 08:36.034
Are you saying that if his
son is hitting on that girl,

08:36.046 --> 08:37.808
don't you think he needs to know that?

08:37.933 --> 08:40.082
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

08:40.116 --> 08:42.380
- Oh. Well, we can't have that.
- No, we can't.

08:42.392 --> 08:45.354
- Oh. I'll get an address.
- Thank you.

08:45.378 --> 08:46.581
Ugh.

08:46.863 --> 08:48.394
But you said you didn't see it.

08:52.033 --> 08:55.309
Listen, are you so
worried about the church

08:55.378 --> 08:57.968
that you would let that
man beat on that girl?

08:57.980 --> 09:01.780
No, no, no, no. I just don't want
to ruin somebody's reputation or...

09:01.789 --> 09:03.788
Or a life if we're wrong.

09:03.807 --> 09:05.626
- That's all.
- But I'm not wrong!

09:05.949 --> 09:09.780
I'm not wrong. I saw what I
saw, and I know what I saw. Okay?

09:09.831 --> 09:11.881
- Okay. Okay. I'll get an address.
- Okay.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.902
Okay. Thank you.

09:18.784 --> 09:20.171
When?

09:22.814 --> 09:24.224
Well, I'm helping you.

09:26.026 --> 09:28.329
Okay, could you get the address, though?

09:28.341 --> 09:31.935
- You think it's that bad?
- Yes, it's this bad. This is... listen.

09:31.958 --> 09:34.086
I have worked with this situation a lot.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.689
It is this bad.

09:35.716 --> 09:37.881
Now, please, could you
just get me the address?

09:37.927 --> 09:39.733
Okay, well, I got to
call Pastor Porter first.

09:39.820 --> 09:42.198
What the devil he got
to do with it? Listen.

09:42.244 --> 09:43.560
You do whatever you need to do,

09:43.574 --> 09:45.646
- but I need to get that address.
- Oh.

09:45.716 --> 09:49.151
- Okay.
- Come on! I need to get that address.

09:51.243 --> 09:53.127
- Now!
- Ugh! Ooh.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.388
Ooh. I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

09:56.807 --> 09:58.645
Ooh. Pastor Porter?

09:58.770 --> 10:01.146
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm good.
I'm good. How you doing?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.170
I need a address for Kendrick.

10:05.193 --> 10:06.814
I'll tell you about it later.

10:06.846 --> 10:08.187
Yeah. I'll meet you over there.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.936
I'm going to pray for
her, but I can't stand her,

10:18.190 --> 10:19.995
and I'm a Christian.

10:20.372 --> 10:22.394
- Uh, hello.
- What?

10:22.820 --> 10:24.211
- Oh! Oh.
- Right.

10:24.234 --> 10:25.850
When you going to get
me back with the number?

10:26.389 --> 10:27.601
Oh. Okay. Okay.

10:30.207 --> 10:33.007
- Okay. How long? How long?
- How long what?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.239
Oh!

10:38.391 --> 10:39.772
About a hour.

10:40.231 --> 10:42.281
Ah? An hour?

10:42.360 --> 10:43.695
Well, he said he's got
to call some other people,

10:43.710 --> 10:45.113
you know, and find out.
Miss Thing, you know,

10:45.132 --> 10:46.055
when she bought them purple shoes,

10:46.069 --> 10:47.733
- she got to find out where she bought that...
- Joann!

10:47.742 --> 10:49.352
... because, you know,
we got over there,

10:49.355 --> 10:51.174
and that child had a big old sale on.

10:51.175 --> 10:52.642
- Joann!
- Oh!

10:53.094 --> 10:54.697
Oh, you're talking about that.

10:54.736 --> 10:56.157
Oh. You're talking about
something important.

10:57.028 --> 11:00.412
- Why is it going to take so long?
- Ella, Ella, Ella, calm down.

11:00.441 --> 11:04.054
- I'm sure it's going to be just fine.
- I am calm. I just sometimes am worked up.

11:04.059 --> 11:06.098
- Okay?
- Yeah.

11:06.109 --> 11:08.609
- I mean, she's got two kids.
- Yes.

11:09.004 --> 11:10.624
You know what?

11:11.070 --> 11:12.960
I don't like this. This is not good.

11:13.085 --> 11:15.994
- This is not good at all.
- I know. Ella, Ella,

11:16.119 --> 11:17.784
they're going to get
back to me. I promise.

11:17.796 --> 11:19.603
He'll get back to me with
that number. In the meantime,

11:19.615 --> 11:22.493
- well, let's just finish up here.
- Okay. Well, thank you.

11:22.919 --> 11:25.164
- Thank you for helping.
- Sure.

11:25.198 --> 11:26.649
Uh, but what about me?

11:26.696 --> 11:29.292
- Man.
- I worked. I want to get paid.

11:29.770 --> 11:32.649
We did not come over here to get
any money. These are our relatives.

11:32.821 --> 11:34.416
Well, it's all relative,

11:36.206 --> 11:37.945
but I worked, and I want to get paid.

11:37.974 --> 11:43.160
- Uh, boy, stop it.
- Oh, Mama, don't stop it. Pay it.

11:44.081 --> 11:47.212
Well, I don't mind. You
have been really helpful.

11:47.337 --> 11:48.767
But, Ella,

11:50.631 --> 11:52.462
"well, I don't mind." Excuse me?

11:52.503 --> 11:54.172
How much do we owe you?

11:54.702 --> 11:57.690
- Ella!
- Curtis, hush!

11:58.571 --> 12:01.477
He's in college. The
boy needs some money.

12:03.464 --> 12:05.347
How much do we owe you, son?

12:05.472 --> 12:07.569
Well, according to my calculations,

12:07.586 --> 12:10.747
if I add the five and carry the one

12:10.872 --> 12:12.710
and move that over to
11 and count for that,

12:12.751 --> 12:14.530
well, about $11,000.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.923
He got you laughing, too.

12:23.048 --> 12:25.899
Thank God I hired a jackass

12:26.889 --> 12:28.824
because you getting $11,

12:30.194 --> 12:32.860
and you're going to pay me
back 3 of them for taxes,

12:33.775 --> 12:37.552
and I gave you some tater
chips and a sugar cube.

12:38.541 --> 12:39.854
Uncle Curtis...

12:40.079 --> 12:42.025
And here's a bye-bye for free.

12:44.362 --> 12:46.003
You really want to play that game?

12:46.636 --> 12:48.445
I play games all day.

12:49.677 --> 12:51.646
Okay. It's on.

12:51.765 --> 12:52.717
Aunt Ella,

12:52.735 --> 12:54.793
I can always take you by the
laundromat whenever you're ready.

12:54.808 --> 12:55.939
Ryan?

12:56.727 --> 12:58.258
Good. I want to go.

12:58.293 --> 13:00.607
Good. It's right around the
corner, about two minutes away.

13:00.607 --> 13:01.977
Ryan?

13:02.829 --> 13:05.705
- How's now?
- Now is great.

13:07.849 --> 13:09.562
Good.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.649
You know what? Let me
just go and get changed.

13:11.774 --> 13:14.263
Curtis said it's nice,
so I want to look nice.

13:14.291 --> 13:16.691
- Okay.
- And Curtis said it's busy.

13:16.968 --> 13:18.252
Did he?

13:18.286 --> 13:21.308
Busy and nice, a double whammy.

13:25.834 --> 13:27.636
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:27.761 --> 13:29.126
I'm going to go get changed

13:29.155 --> 13:30.963
because I don't want to look toe-up.

13:30.997 --> 13:32.679
Only thing toe-up is that place.

13:32.697 --> 13:34.216
- Say what?
- Uh, uh,

13:34.245 --> 13:38.425
- what you have on will work just fine.
- Heh! This old thing?

13:39.190 --> 13:42.478
- Don't be silly. I'll be right back.
- You hurry.

13:42.539 --> 13:46.301
I will. Curtis, get
this trash out of here.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.815
Okay, baby.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.604
Can we give her one
shock at a time, please?

13:52.627 --> 13:54.550
- Ugh.
- One shock at a time?

13:54.579 --> 13:57.601
- Hmm. I'm going home.
- No, you are not going home.

13:57.613 --> 14:00.111
Joann, you got me in this mess,

14:00.140 --> 14:01.832
and you going to be
there when she see it.

14:01.838 --> 14:05.016
Unh-unh. No. I don't either.
Unh-unh. I'm going home.

14:05.027 --> 14:06.115
I love you, cousin. Bye.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.910
Ella, I'll call you when that come
and get back to me with the number.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.954
I love my mama. She's such
a great woman, isn't she?

14:14.977 --> 14:18.144
- I love my mama.
- Your mama.

14:18.446 --> 14:20.254
There's still a way for
you to get out of this.

14:21.535 --> 14:23.701
- How?
- Pay up.

14:24.679 --> 14:28.152
- How about a
slap-up? - Auntie Ella?

14:34.947 --> 14:37.272
- Come on, baby.
- Watch it, Curtis!

14:39.834 --> 14:42.390
- This is a door.
- Yes, baby. Come on. I got you.

14:42.413 --> 14:44.350
- Why would you push me into that?
- He hadn't opened it.

14:44.390 --> 14:46.042
He acting like he don't
know what he's doing.

14:46.077 --> 14:48.593
- What is this on this door?
- Baby, don't worry about that. That's just tape.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.957
- Come on, now.
- Curtis, I don't trust you.

14:53.251 --> 14:55.732
- You got to walk.
- Baby, this thing itches.

14:55.857 --> 14:58.720
Baby, I know, but I need you
to have the blindfold on, okay?

14:58.755 --> 15:01.006
Okay. Well, how long? What? Curtis.

15:01.131 --> 15:03.730
- I know. We almost there, baby.
- Well, are we almost in there yet?

15:03.730 --> 15:04.916
- We... we there.
- I'll take it off.

15:04.928 --> 15:06.442
Okay. Uh, get gutted.

15:06.567 --> 15:08.647
- Violent.
- Curtis.

15:08.772 --> 15:10.282
One more step, baby.

15:11.784 --> 15:13.517
One more step, baby.

15:14.069 --> 15:16.263
Curtis! I'm getting... you know what?

15:16.326 --> 15:18.111
I'm... I... I... I... I'm getting dizzy.

15:18.236 --> 15:19.653
Oh. I see the tactic.

15:19.676 --> 15:21.720
Spin her around till she
thinks she's in a fun house.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.431
- You shut up.
- Curtis, this feels ridiculous.

15:24.501 --> 15:26.118
Okay, baby.

15:28.185 --> 15:30.367
There's nothing in this
house that's a fun house.

15:32.526 --> 15:35.099
I've had enough of this, Curtis, enough.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.247
I'm getting ready to
take this thing off.

15:37.578 --> 15:39.582
- Hold on, baby.
- I'm getting ready to take this thing off, Curtis.

15:39.604 --> 15:40.710
- Don't do it.
- I can't take this.

15:40.725 --> 15:41.889
Don't do it. Don't do it, baby. Stop.

15:41.963 --> 15:43.469
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.085
Surprise!

15:46.729 --> 15:48.430
I take it she's not impressed.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.683
I take it you about to die.

15:58.373 --> 15:59.773
Is she okay?

16:01.445 --> 16:02.721
You all right, babe?

16:03.794 --> 16:05.286
I think this is the...
This the right place?

16:05.360 --> 16:07.911
- This is the right place?
- Mm-hmm.

16:08.859 --> 16:10.066
Curtis.

16:10.812 --> 16:12.577
Baby, say something.

16:13.297 --> 16:14.498
Curtis.

16:14.939 --> 16:18.019
- Say something, baby.
- Curtis, what is this?

16:18.525 --> 16:21.994
- Baby, it's a laundromat. It's a laundromat.
- What is this?

16:22.119 --> 16:24.650
It's the laundromat, surprise.

16:25.258 --> 16:26.906
Surprise.

16:28.997 --> 16:30.766
- Curtis.
- Yes, baby.

16:30.798 --> 16:33.087
Wow. She really knows your name.

16:34.335 --> 16:36.017
And you're going to know my fist.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.191
Can you say "beatdown"?

16:38.600 --> 16:40.511
No, but I think she can.

16:44.241 --> 16:45.702
Baby, let me explain.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.986
- Can I explain it to you?
- Yeah, Curtis, I just got to.

16:49.018 --> 16:51.142
- I got to hear this one.
- Me, too.

16:53.794 --> 16:56.032
It wasn't like this. It really wasn't.

16:57.362 --> 16:59.126
That hurricane yesterday,

17:00.660 --> 17:03.939
it ripped this place in half. No.

17:05.537 --> 17:06.915
You remember Joann?

17:07.596 --> 17:09.023
You know Joann, my cousin.

17:09.425 --> 17:11.579
We just left her at the house,

17:12.031 --> 17:14.905
- Uncle Ricky's daughter.
- Robert.

17:16.218 --> 17:17.337
You remember.

17:19.843 --> 17:21.220
Funny thing...

17:22.858 --> 17:25.858
She told me this place
made $8,000 a month.

17:25.922 --> 17:28.000
Curtis?

17:28.040 --> 17:31.993
This place is going
to cost $8,000 a month.

17:32.564 --> 17:34.761
I know, baby. I know,

17:35.134 --> 17:36.681
and that's why I got a plan.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.201
- Me and Ryan...
- What?

17:41.928 --> 17:43.931
... and some of his
buddies from the college...

17:45.387 --> 17:47.282
... that he say he go to

17:48.768 --> 17:50.527
that exists somewhere,

17:51.839 --> 17:53.737
we're going to clean it up,
baby, make it look brand-new.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.481
With what money,
Curtis? With what money?

17:56.647 --> 17:58.590
Baby, we're going to do it for free.

17:58.761 --> 18:00.079
Hmm? Don't believe that.

18:01.852 --> 18:03.469
Yeah. Will you shush?

18:05.836 --> 18:07.687
That in exchange...

18:07.710 --> 18:09.197
For...

18:09.211 --> 18:12.697
... for me letting them do
their laundry here for free.

18:12.895 --> 18:15.064
You didn't say that before.
That's not a bad idea.

18:16.188 --> 18:17.225
And...

18:17.266 --> 18:18.868
Can we throw in a few frat parties?

18:22.323 --> 18:23.779
Can you shut up?

18:26.021 --> 18:27.173
Please?

18:27.716 --> 18:30.811
Uh, look at her face.

18:31.866 --> 18:33.790
This is ridiculous.

18:33.984 --> 18:37.235
Baby...

18:46.283 --> 18:47.706
What's that noise?

18:48.364 --> 18:49.926
What... what are you doing?

18:50.741 --> 18:52.288
Somebody done broke in.

18:52.919 --> 18:54.508
Well, you're the manager.

18:54.992 --> 18:57.363
You're supposed to handle
it, not be all up under me.

18:57.382 --> 18:58.377
Get off of me!

18:58.395 --> 18:59.883
But you don't cover hazard pay.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.582
As a matter of fact,
you don't cover any pay.

19:01.605 --> 19:02.996
Why am I even here?

19:03.590 --> 19:06.048
I keep asking myself that every day.

19:08.395 --> 19:09.514
- Okay.
- Do something.

19:09.546 --> 19:12.945
If you get out from under my
armpit and let my shirt go.

19:13.322 --> 19:15.225
Let me go. Let me go.

19:15.234 --> 19:16.858
- Okay!
- Let me go.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.983
My g...

19:18.995 --> 19:20.816
Who's back there?

19:21.746 --> 19:23.810
Come out from back there. I mean it!

19:24.662 --> 19:25.785
Yeah!

19:26.250 --> 19:27.646
We're going to... play the dogs!

19:27.665 --> 19:29.497
- You play the dogs. They're over there.
- But where they at?

19:29.794 --> 19:32.274
- What dogs?
- But... but they... there's no dog.

19:32.275 --> 19:33.287
Get a better dog.

19:41.032 --> 19:43.133
If you're back there, please come out.

19:43.147 --> 19:45.016
Olly, olly, olly in free.

19:47.028 --> 19:48.409
You better come out from back there.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.134
I'm going to let these big dogs loose.

19:55.454 --> 19:56.530
We're sorry.

19:57.749 --> 19:58.776
We're sorry.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.936
Don't let the dog loose. I'm sorry.

20:07.179 --> 20:08.362
Who are you?

20:12.298 --> 20:13.595
Nyla.
