WEBVTT

00:38.204 --> 00:39.247
Hm?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.461
Didn't think it through, did you? Pah!

00:44.669 --> 00:45.962
No one ever does.

00:49.215 --> 00:53.803
So, no need to run. Aughra cares
for all the creatures of Thra.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.680
Even the foolish ones.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.851
Ah, I'll patch you up good as new.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.270
Even though you did try to steal my mind.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.856
Lucky you didn't get the chance.

01:04.939 --> 01:06.733
Your little brain would've popped!

01:15.742 --> 01:17.994
Stings, does it? Blame yourself.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.913
But most never do.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.458
It will leave a scar, but scars are good.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.087
Minds forget, scars remember, hmm.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.005
-Hm?

01:29.089 --> 01:29.964
What now?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.345
Bah!

01:51.111 --> 01:54.781
I warned you, Fara,
but you would not listen.

01:56.116 --> 02:00.495
By the lords' grace,
Stone-in-the-Wood shall rise once more.

02:03.915 --> 02:04.833
Bah!

02:05.458 --> 02:07.460
Mother Aughra.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.753
Seladon.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.297
New crown, I see.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.924
New clothes.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.635
Some dress to conceal their body,

02:16.177 --> 02:18.304
others to reveal their nature.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.016
Perhaps my Paladins
should seize you where you stand.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.274
Look around you, prophet.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.025
Was this in your visions?

02:31.609 --> 02:36.156
Where were your minions when the Skeksis
turned their wrath upon Stone-in-the-Wood?

02:36.281 --> 02:37.615
Doing what they must.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.910
Finding the key to ending Skeksis' power.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.997
I will negotiate peace

02:44.080 --> 02:45.790
-for all Gelfling.
-Hm? Bah!

02:46.207 --> 02:48.209
The Skeksis care nothing for peace.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.711
Turn back.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.963
Turn back before it's too late!

02:52.046 --> 02:55.300
The All-Maudra
is not yours to command, witch!

02:55.383 --> 02:57.802
You trifle with powers
you cannot understand!

03:00.096 --> 03:01.347
Trust Aughra.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.436
I trust... in the lords.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.731
Foolish child.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.982
Move, crone!

03:11.065 --> 03:12.150
You're blind.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.695
You're standing in the All-Maudra's way.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.082
Now, Aughra shall see.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.503
Don't worry, Mother Aughra.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.799
I will convince the Skeksis to show mercy

03:36.925 --> 03:40.345
upon you and your treasonous pets.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.223
-Hi-yah!

03:43.306 --> 03:45.266
To the Castle of the Crystal!

03:45.350 --> 03:46.809
-Yah!

03:51.898 --> 03:53.316
Brave Gelfling.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.485
Lost, but brave.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.738
Cannot see past her own rage, hm!

03:59.447 --> 04:00.949
But most never do.

04:04.535 --> 04:05.703
And you...

04:05.828 --> 04:08.289
I have a job for you, little one.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.470
Mm...

04:24.639 --> 04:27.892
Greetings, wretched Gruenaks.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.310
- Ah...

04:29.394 --> 04:32.021
Yes. I'm here to commend.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.816
Much work you have done, yes?

04:34.899 --> 04:40.321
Help make the Scientist's machine
come to life in such short order.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.700
Make... essence.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.288
A vial for each Skeksis, yes?

04:48.621 --> 04:51.457
Including... General.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.459
A fellow,

04:53.543 --> 04:57.130
a crafty fellow with great stealth

04:57.714 --> 05:00.800
could replace the essence of my enemy.

05:02.802 --> 05:06.597
No, no, no! Not with something
so vulgar as poison,

05:06.889 --> 05:11.185
but perhaps switch essence
with a simple draft of water

05:11.269 --> 05:15.148
and glowing milk
of the desert Swothel, yes?

05:15.273 --> 05:18.651
General will grow weak, vulnerable.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.571
Perhaps crafty wretches
who took such risks

05:21.654 --> 05:25.450
to rid me of meddlesome enemy
would earn freedom.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.997
If those wretches do job well

05:31.456 --> 05:35.418
and... tell... no one.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.503
Hmm.

05:44.927 --> 05:48.973
Ah... good. Is deal, then.

05:49.807 --> 05:52.560
Now, we wait.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.937
Mmm...

06:08.910 --> 06:10.411
We must go after Brea.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.289
-Your stolen friend was right.
-Mm-hm...

06:13.373 --> 06:16.667
The Hunter has set a trap.
SkekMal's using her as bait.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.503
She will not be harmed.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.713
First, retrieve the Glaive.

06:20.963 --> 06:21.798
Then...

06:22.382 --> 06:24.801
defeat... the Skeksis.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.180
Hup... go.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.307
You need to rest.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.852
We will watch over your friend-slave.

06:34.936 --> 06:35.895
And...

06:36.312 --> 06:38.564
-the Archer.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.192
Deet...

06:42.360 --> 06:43.361
careful.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.199
It'll take forever
to walk all the way to Grot.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.159
Then do not walk.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.496
-Huh?
-But do... follow.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.130
Come along now.
We haven't got all day.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.092
Rian...

07:06.926 --> 07:08.386
careful too.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.263
I'll see you again...

07:12.265 --> 07:13.182
friend.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.894
Mm-hmm.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.942
Behold.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.865
Where does it lead?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.908
To the Breath of Thra.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.535
The Breath of Thra?

07:32.618 --> 07:34.537
- Yeah.
-All the way out here?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.457
What's the Breath of Thra?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.126
-You'll see.
- Remember,

07:40.209 --> 07:44.005
as you travel your path,
you carry with you the seed of hope

07:44.172 --> 07:46.924
that we, too, shall be one again.

07:47.633 --> 07:52.472
So, don't... get...  killed.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.431
Hmm.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.266
All right then. Best of luck.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.644
I can barely see where I'm going.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.566
I think that rock just tried
to take a bite out of me.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.860
Your eyes will adjust eventually...

08:06.486 --> 08:07.695
-Daylighter.
-Hm?

08:08.362 --> 08:09.447
Daylighter?

08:09.530 --> 08:12.617
Grottans have all kinds of names
for Gelfling that live above ground.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.453
-Sun Brain, Moon Child.
-Hm, very funny.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.038
Tunnel Screamer.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.290
Yes, you're hilarious.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.586
You'll get to hear them all
when you meet my family.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.129
Oh, good.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.512
-What's that sound?

08:32.803 --> 08:34.222
The Breath of Thra.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.933
Come on, Sky Baby!

08:38.684 --> 08:41.562
I think I prefer "Daylighter."

08:42.021 --> 08:46.150
These tunnels capture the warm air
from the fire at the center of our world

08:46.234 --> 08:48.444
and carry it through the ground
like veins.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.949
And that's why they call it
the Breath of Thra.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.369
It's incredible.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.954
-Ready?
-Huh?

08:59.413 --> 09:00.498
We're going in there?

09:01.207 --> 09:03.334
Unless you want to spend
the next three days walking.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.253
Well, what if you don't have wings?

09:05.336 --> 09:07.046
Uh, you get smashed to bits.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.800
Just another reason
why it's good to have friends.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.593
-Uh...
-Try not to scream.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.970
It scares the Hollerbats.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.222
Oh, the Holler--

09:16.305 --> 09:17.682
Whoo!

09:18.516 --> 09:22.144
No, what are you-- Deet!

09:22.853 --> 09:25.481
-Woo-hoo!

09:26.482 --> 09:29.277
- Woo-hoo!

09:37.535 --> 09:40.288
Ah! Come in. Come in.

09:40.663 --> 09:45.084
Welcome, Gelfling of Stone-in-the-Wood.
Take a seat.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.351
Huh?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.604
-What?
- Sublime!

10:05.104 --> 10:06.355
Sublime.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.232
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, no!

10:09.859 --> 10:10.985
What's going on?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.071
-No, no! It can't be!
-What's happening?

10:14.155 --> 10:15.698
- It's all true!
-Let us go!

10:16.741 --> 10:19.201
You're wasting your time.

10:19.452 --> 10:24.540
I have strapped scores of Gelfling
into these very chairs.

10:25.166 --> 10:29.128
And I was equally unmoved
by their screams.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.174
- No!

10:33.674 --> 10:36.844
But I was loyal!
I warned you of the guard's revolt!

10:38.054 --> 10:38.971
Ha!

10:41.557 --> 10:45.853
Ah, then it is only fitting you meet
the same end as your fellow guards.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.022
Please, my lord. Mercy!

10:48.105 --> 10:52.652
The only mercy I have left to offer...

10:53.027 --> 10:54.612
is death.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.458
Yes!

11:14.423 --> 11:16.217
Gaze into the beam!

11:18.177 --> 11:20.054
Ah! Yes!

11:24.225 --> 11:25.768
Now...

11:26.143 --> 11:28.771
give yourself to the Crystal.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.999
Give the Crystal everything!

11:49.333 --> 11:52.920
Give the Skeksis your essence!

12:11.147 --> 12:13.983
Good, sterling.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.698
Fresh essence.

12:21.449 --> 12:25.119
Ambrosial and exquisite.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.246
Bring the essence.

12:27.371 --> 12:31.500
The patience of the Emperor is finite
and decreasing exponentially.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.085
But...

12:33.961 --> 12:37.381
the Chamberlain's vial stays.

12:37.506 --> 12:43.053
The Emperor remains displeased
with skekSil. Ha!

12:56.484 --> 12:58.027
Look! We made it!

12:58.110 --> 13:00.321
- Ah! Magnificent!
- My home.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.157
That's Domrak! Isn't it beautiful?

13:05.534 --> 13:06.786
Hello there!

13:07.161 --> 13:09.121
-Huh?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.582
- Spitter!
-No!

13:14.293 --> 13:16.128
- Watch out!

13:21.467 --> 13:24.678
-Deet, are you hurt?
-I'm fine. Look!

13:38.025 --> 13:40.152
I am the Ascendancy.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.991
What are those small creatures?
Are they Arathim too?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.576
They're not like any Arathim
I've ever seen.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.080
I think they're somehow
controlling those Gelfling.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.040
-My family.
-Huh?

13:53.123 --> 13:54.416
We have to find them!

13:55.167 --> 13:56.877
I know every tunnel through these caves.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.004
Yes. Right behind you.

14:04.552 --> 14:07.471
Keep up, you lackadaisical lumps!

14:08.055 --> 14:12.017
Now that
I have mechanized the draining process,

14:12.101 --> 14:14.770
I can drain Gelfling
on a prodigious scale.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.440
-The Emperor will be pleased with me.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.449
I said keep up!

14:42.590 --> 14:43.674
About time.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.972
Out of my way!

14:50.055 --> 14:53.183
- Stop this at once!

14:53.267 --> 14:55.603
-Look at yourselves.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.730
Squealing, gorging.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.858
This essence is hard come by.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.985
Let's not use it all today.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.781
I'm kidding, you fools. Dig in!

15:17.458 --> 15:21.253
We are Skeksis eternal!

15:21.337 --> 15:24.381
Skeksis eternal. Hail to the Emperor!

15:24.465 --> 15:26.258
Skeksis eternal!

15:26.342 --> 15:28.844
Hail the Emperor!

15:29.720 --> 15:32.264
- Yeah!
- Yes, drink!

15:32.556 --> 15:33.557
- The euphoria!

15:33.974 --> 15:35.351
Indeed!

15:39.188 --> 15:41.690
Splendiferous rejuvenation.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.195
A sensation like no other!

15:48.781 --> 15:52.618
-I can see! My eyes are working!

15:53.035 --> 15:56.538
I'd forgotten just how ugly you all are!

15:59.833 --> 16:00.709
What?

16:01.752 --> 16:02.670
Rapturous!

16:03.045 --> 16:06.298
I will create a new ritual
for the consuming of essence.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.968
-One with many ablutions.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.761
Ablutions!

16:11.637 --> 16:13.055
What's an ablution?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.140
Mm...

16:17.685 --> 16:18.936
-Hm.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.438
One of you tell me what an ablution is.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.023
-I demand--
-Ablution.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.151
My pustules stopped oozing!

16:26.819 --> 16:28.612
-What?

16:29.154 --> 16:32.950
I am beautiful once again!

16:34.618 --> 16:36.996
It isn't working! It isn't working!

16:37.287 --> 16:40.290
Why? Why?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.710
- Something is wrong.
- A temper...

16:44.920 --> 16:47.047
- Celebrate!

16:47.172 --> 16:50.259
We are Lords of the Crystal and Thra!

16:52.386 --> 16:54.346
Excellent work.

16:54.596 --> 16:59.143
Will be rewarded with freedom
for you and friend.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.979
-When time is right.
-Mm...

17:02.062 --> 17:05.399
The Chamberlain is back where belongs.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.405
Such power!

17:13.824 --> 17:15.784
All-Maudra here.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.077
Bring her.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.208
-What?

17:23.876 --> 17:27.087
-The All-Maudra requests an audience.
-The All-Maudra?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.380
She's dead.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.549
The <i>new</i> All-Maudra.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.592
Ah.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.802
Well, then,

17:34.428 --> 17:35.637
show her in!

17:38.223 --> 17:41.810
They barely had time
for them to burn the last one.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.273
I wonder if it's as ugly.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.778
Oh, yes, very ugly.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.405
Wise and noble Emperor,

17:53.697 --> 17:56.366
I am Seladon of Ha'rar,

17:56.617 --> 18:00.329
daughter to Mayrin,
the traitor All-Maudra.

18:00.829 --> 18:01.997
Proceed.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.959
My mother was led astray by conspirators

18:06.043 --> 18:10.589
who foolishly wished to overthrow
the mighty Lords of the Crystal.

18:10.964 --> 18:14.093
Now, I come before you to plead for mercy.

18:16.220 --> 18:20.265
I humbly beg of you
to release the Stonewood,

18:20.557 --> 18:24.603
so they may continue to serve Skeksis
as all Gelfling do.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.606
Uh...

18:28.065 --> 18:29.066
No.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.904
I understand.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.908
The Stonewood must pay for their defiance,

18:38.200 --> 18:41.703
but the other clans
have not forgotten their place.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.290
Surely they will be spared your wrath.

18:46.917 --> 18:47.751
No.

18:55.884 --> 18:56.718
No.

19:04.893 --> 19:05.894
Emperor,

19:06.353 --> 19:09.857
-you are as wise as you are fair.
-Mm...

19:10.357 --> 19:13.861
Of course a few traitors
may hide within any clan,

19:14.319 --> 19:19.241
but punishment will be reserved for those
who dare spread the filthy lie

19:19.324 --> 19:21.326
that you are draining Gelfling!

19:21.910 --> 19:24.913
-But we <i>do </i>drain Gelfling.

19:24.997 --> 19:29.001
So we may drink your essence!

19:35.007 --> 19:37.050
Poor, poor child.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.565
Seven Gelfling from each clan.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.277
That is the request you made of my mother,

19:55.986 --> 19:58.322
and I shall honor it.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.576
Volunteers to serve as you see fit.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.205
A small price to pay
for a new age of peace.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.123
Uh...

20:09.958 --> 20:10.792
No.

20:13.670 --> 20:17.299
-She offers her own to us.
- How coldhearted.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.009
She could be a Skeksis.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.889
Lords of the Crystal, please.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.684
My sisters, Brea and Tavra.
Spare them if no others.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.269
No!

20:34.149 --> 20:36.026
Look at me!

20:36.360 --> 20:38.570
I'm the All-Maudra!

20:41.406 --> 20:43.909
I'm the leader of the Gelfling!

20:45.619 --> 20:48.747
The ruler of the dead!

20:51.208 --> 20:53.377
Look at her face.

20:54.253 --> 20:58.131
I think she's going to cry.

20:59.466 --> 21:00.384
Enough!

21:02.177 --> 21:03.095
Huh?

21:03.428 --> 21:05.931
The All-Maudra was a shepherd.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.726
Now, it's time to harvest the herd!

21:14.022 --> 21:14.856
No, please!

21:15.482 --> 21:17.109
Please, my lords!

21:17.192 --> 21:18.527
Please! Please!

21:18.610 --> 21:20.779
No! Please! My lords, please!

21:21.655 --> 21:22.489
Mercy!

21:28.537 --> 21:29.871
No, no, no, no, no!

21:42.009 --> 21:45.137
- Stop it! Leave me alone!
- All right, that's enough.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.977
Drain it.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.112
No! Don't! Stop it!

22:04.323 --> 22:05.490
Fresh essence?

22:15.459 --> 22:18.837
Follow her. Follow! Quickly!

22:26.803 --> 22:28.472
Poor lost child.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.858
There. That's where I live.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.716
All clear.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.178
My home.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.306
It's...

23:12.557 --> 23:13.725
destroyed.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.561
I'm so sorry, Deet.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.482
My fathers.

23:20.899 --> 23:21.942
My brother.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.611
I should never have left.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.077
We'll get your family back.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.374
-Why would the Arathim do this?
-I--

23:38.625 --> 23:40.627
What did the Grottan ever do to them?

23:40.961 --> 23:43.296
- Who's there?

23:44.381 --> 23:45.841
Show yourself!

23:48.385 --> 23:49.511
Is it a Spitter?

23:50.679 --> 23:51.555
Come out.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.306
I won't warn you again!

23:54.057 --> 23:55.142
It's my brother!

24:00.021 --> 24:02.691
He's under
the Arathim's control too.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.151
Oh, no.

24:04.943 --> 24:05.861
Bobb'n.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.864
We not Bobb'n.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.076
Whoever you are, I beg you,

24:13.785 --> 24:15.162
let my little brother go.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.289
We...

24:17.789 --> 24:20.667
-...Ascendancy.
-Deet, be careful.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.211
He's just a childling.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.131
He'd never hurt anyone.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.144
-What is he doing?
-He's calling the others.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.272
You have to stop! Bobb'n, stop!

24:42.355 --> 24:44.065
- It's too late!

24:50.864 --> 24:52.532
Here it comes!

24:53.116 --> 24:54.034
No!

24:58.705 --> 24:59.748
Where'd it go?

25:00.123 --> 25:01.666
-Bobb'n, stop!

25:01.791 --> 25:04.711
-We have to go after him!
-Deet! Wait!

25:16.056 --> 25:17.349
-What's that?
-Nurloc.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.769
-That's a Nurloc?
-It's darkened.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.066
-Bobb'n!
- Oh, this is bad!

25:28.235 --> 25:29.236
Watch out!

25:33.114 --> 25:35.450
Deet, get your brother to safety!

25:39.120 --> 25:41.414
Bobb'n! Come back!

25:41.498 --> 25:44.793
Wait! Look at me!

25:45.460 --> 25:46.503
You hungry?

25:46.586 --> 25:48.672
I'm a much tastier Gelfling!

25:52.217 --> 25:53.260
Rian, no!

26:01.017 --> 26:03.228
Don't worry! I've got this!

26:04.521 --> 26:08.358
Dinner time! Come on!
That's it! That's right!

26:08.650 --> 26:10.527
-Come on! Come on!

26:15.532 --> 26:16.575
Follow me.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.012
You think yourself so smart.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.264
Now, what are you prattling on about?

26:39.347 --> 26:42.309
-Your essence fails! You're a fraud!
-Bah!

26:42.726 --> 26:46.896
You can swindle the Emperor
and the others, but not me!

26:47.314 --> 26:48.481
I see through you.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.401
Your so-called Elixir of Life is a lie!

26:51.484 --> 26:53.945
Ow! Hands off, malcontent.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.032
What can you do to stop me, weakling?

26:58.783 --> 27:02.120
It seems you are the weak one.

27:02.203 --> 27:06.333
There is nothing wrong with the essence.
The fault must lie within you!

27:08.960 --> 27:10.462
Impossible!

27:10.712 --> 27:12.672
Easy, friends.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.966
No need for quarrel.

27:15.091 --> 27:18.928
Nothing worse
than seeing Skeksis turn on Skeksis.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.180
Mm?

27:22.974 --> 27:24.142
Huh?

27:47.707 --> 27:49.501
-Huh?

27:53.630 --> 27:55.465
- What is it?
- What?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.134
What happened?

27:58.760 --> 28:00.136
-Smells like...
- It's arrows!

28:00.553 --> 28:02.222
- What? How?
- What's happened?

28:04.265 --> 28:05.975
Nothing more.
Nothing more!

28:06.059 --> 28:09.062
- Is he all right? Is he dead?
-SkekMal?

28:09.437 --> 28:11.731
Careful! Careful! Careful!

28:14.567 --> 28:18.613
-Is he dead?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.448
-What?
- Oh, skekMal!

28:20.782 --> 28:22.242
We must help our fallen brother.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.535
Is that skekMal's blood?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.663
- Who did this?
-Does the Hunter live? Is he dead?

28:27.455 --> 28:29.499
-Alive...

28:29.624 --> 28:31.334
but barely.

28:39.467 --> 28:40.844
And where does this tunnel lead?

28:41.553 --> 28:42.637
I'm not sure.

28:43.430 --> 28:46.725
I thought you knew... all the tunnels.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.311
Wait. Shh!

28:52.105 --> 28:53.481
I hear something.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.233
Is it Bobb'n?

28:55.900 --> 28:57.527
I don't think so.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.747
Get back, Rian, now!

29:14.085 --> 29:16.337
No! No!

29:17.797 --> 29:20.717
I am the Ascendancy.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.974
Join the Ascendancy.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.479
No, no! Rian!

29:32.604 --> 29:34.105
Please!

29:34.522 --> 29:37.609
Please, stop! Stop!

29:37.692 --> 29:40.737
- No!

29:57.962 --> 29:58.797
Rian...

29:59.464 --> 30:00.298
Deet?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.343
What happened?

30:07.889 --> 30:09.307
Bobb'n saved us.

30:10.850 --> 30:11.684
Well...

30:12.310 --> 30:14.103
thank you, I guess.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.898
We go this way. We go now.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.360
He wants us to follow.

30:20.693 --> 30:23.530
-What could possibly go wrong?

30:35.792 --> 30:40.755
Subject suffers severe exsanguination.

30:41.381 --> 30:44.968
Extreme distress to the humus.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.719
- The humus?
- What's that?

30:46.803 --> 30:50.306
Imbalance of intrinsic fluids.

30:51.641 --> 30:56.479
Manifold ruptures in corporeal morphology.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.235
Ah. Ah...

31:02.902 --> 31:05.238
Expiration... is...

31:09.367 --> 31:10.952
inevitable.

31:13.705 --> 31:17.584
No, no, no! What could have done this?

31:17.667 --> 31:19.836
Isn't it obvious?

31:20.253 --> 31:21.588
Gelfling!

31:24.215 --> 31:25.884
I feel ill.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.761
But Gelfling could not have done this.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.139
-Not to Skeksis!
-No.

31:31.472 --> 31:32.974
Not to the strongest!

31:33.391 --> 31:35.810
-No!

31:36.936 --> 31:39.689
Well, any one of us could be next!

31:43.359 --> 31:44.360
Quiet!

31:44.444 --> 31:47.280
Give the Hunter essence now
and as much as it takes.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.700
Perhaps not all of it.

31:53.786 --> 31:56.122
SkekMal must not die!

31:56.205 --> 31:59.083
It will be done, my Emperor.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.963
-What's that? That noise.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.760
It's coming from in there.

32:15.224 --> 32:17.226
-Hm... oh!

32:17.685 --> 32:18.686
Ah...

32:23.316 --> 32:25.401
Oh, look!

32:28.905 --> 32:31.950
The clever princess.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.120
No, you can't do this!

32:36.537 --> 32:39.248
And yet it is already done.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.708
You're all monsters!

32:40.792 --> 32:43.169
Have you only just figured that out?

32:43.252 --> 32:46.673
Perhaps you are not so clever after all.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.690
The Skeksis gave us everything.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.400
Seladon.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.819
And now they're taking it all back.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.738
What happened to you?

33:11.155 --> 33:13.157
There was an order to the world.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.619
Everything... worked...

33:17.870 --> 33:20.957
until you and your friends broke it.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.502
How can you say that?

33:25.044 --> 33:27.463
Look what the Skeksis are doing
to Gelfling!

33:27.630 --> 33:30.216
Mother should have made a deal
with the Skeksis.

33:30.633 --> 33:31.968
Compromised.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.681
Saved the lives of many
by sacrificing a few.

33:38.307 --> 33:39.934
Sacrificing a few?

33:40.560 --> 33:44.856
And who decides who lives
and who dies? You?

33:45.231 --> 33:46.107
Yes!

33:46.691 --> 33:50.445
I am the only one capable
of making the hard choices.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.989
If mother could you see you now--

33:53.072 --> 33:54.574
Mother is dead!

33:55.283 --> 33:57.285
As we will be soon enough...

33:58.578 --> 34:01.456
all thanks to you.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.839
- Pathetic.
-Tavra?

34:09.922 --> 34:11.049
You're alive!

34:11.132 --> 34:12.925
You must get us out of here, sister!

34:15.219 --> 34:19.474
-We are not your sister.
- We are not your sister.

34:21.976 --> 34:22.935
Tavra.

34:23.644 --> 34:25.188
Tavra, what's happening?

34:25.813 --> 34:28.649
We are not Tavra.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.195
Accept your fate,

34:32.862 --> 34:34.363
make your peace.

34:35.073 --> 34:39.535
The age of Gelfling has come to an end.

34:54.383 --> 34:57.637
This is the last of my stores of essence.

35:00.389 --> 35:03.309
-So, drain more Gelfling.

35:03.392 --> 35:07.688
But, Emperor, there are limits
to what even essence can heal.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.487
Right in the beak!

35:14.570 --> 35:18.074
If the Gelfling know we can die,
it will be the end of Skeksis rule.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.701
Drain every last Gelfling in our cages.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.621
Bathe the Hunter in essence if you must.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.165
We are immortal at any cost!

35:30.503 --> 35:31.629
Immortal!

35:32.213 --> 35:34.632
- Immortal!

35:35.424 --> 35:37.218
Come on! Collect them!

35:37.301 --> 35:39.929
Ornamentalist, Scroll-Keeper,
let us be gone!

35:55.611 --> 35:56.529
Bobb'n!

35:57.905 --> 35:59.073
Slow down!

35:59.907 --> 36:00.992
Wait for us!

36:01.492 --> 36:04.162
Bobb'n? Bobb'n? Where have you go--

36:11.169 --> 36:14.005
You save our lives,
we save yours in return.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.215
I don't like this.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.265
Fathers!

36:30.062 --> 36:31.189
Maudra Argot?

36:31.272 --> 36:33.232
No. Wait. It's not her.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.904
We are the Ascendancy.

36:38.613 --> 36:42.158
We are all Arathim as one.

36:42.783 --> 36:43.701
No.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.995
What have you done with the Grottan?

36:46.078 --> 36:49.957
They will be delivered
to the Crystal Castle

36:50.041 --> 36:53.544
in exchange for the return
of our home:

36:53.794 --> 36:55.171
these caves.

36:55.254 --> 36:58.883
This isn't your home, it's ours.
The Grottan have always lived here.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.092
Untrue!

37:00.343 --> 37:02.595
Once, we Arathim made our nest here,

37:02.678 --> 37:04.972
then the Skeksis came.

37:05.431 --> 37:07.767
They demanded we serve them.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.436
When we refused, they drove us out

37:10.561 --> 37:14.857
and gave our caves
to more willing subjects: you.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.360
Now, we will take back our home.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.196
Once and for all.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.291
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

37:33.125 --> 37:35.836
-The Nurlocs!
-They're killing us!

37:40.925 --> 37:42.510
What one feels...

37:43.678 --> 37:45.304
all feel.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.640
It's like dying.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.725
The Nurlocs,
they don't know what they're doing.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.310
They're infected by the Darkening.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.940
But the Skeksis must've known
the Darkening has spread throughout Grot.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.858
Huh...

37:58.985 --> 38:00.278
Well, don't you see?

38:00.903 --> 38:02.405
They've sent you here to die.

38:03.322 --> 38:06.075
The Darkening
destroys everything it touches!

38:06.158 --> 38:07.326
Hm...

38:08.577 --> 38:11.914
Perhaps the Gelfling speaks true.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.292
The Arathim are trapped here.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.086
The Nurlocs have blocked every escape.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.256
-We will be...
-...Exterminated!

38:21.173 --> 38:22.717
I can get you above ground.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.636
The Sanctuary Tree
can take all of us to the surface.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.348
You'd help us after all we've done to you?

38:29.890 --> 38:30.808
Why?

38:30.891 --> 38:33.019
My clan takes our name from these caves.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.021
But if you were here first,

38:35.604 --> 38:37.148
that makes you Grottan too.

38:38.524 --> 38:40.651
What do you ask in return?

38:41.527 --> 38:43.904
Free all the Gelfling under your control

38:44.196 --> 38:46.532
and fight with us against the Skeksis.

38:47.199 --> 38:50.953
Arathim did not defeat Skeksis.

38:51.287 --> 38:54.540
Gelfling cannot defeat Skeksis.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.084
But the Arathim and Gelfling together...

38:57.918 --> 38:59.545
might stand a chance.

39:15.102 --> 39:21.317
The Ascendancy has heard your truth.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.443
Truth...

39:22.777 --> 39:25.738
We will fight by your side.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.365
By your side!

39:27.448 --> 39:30.951
Arathim and Gelfling...

39:31.869 --> 39:34.413
together!

39:49.887 --> 39:50.763
Oh...

39:51.263 --> 39:52.848
-What happened?

39:53.682 --> 39:55.309
-Fathers?
-Oh!

39:55.434 --> 39:56.477
Deet!

39:59.939 --> 40:01.440
-Deet!
-Father!

40:08.072 --> 40:09.281
Fathers!

40:14.286 --> 40:15.496
This is Rian.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.751
We have to get topside.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.670
Ah!

40:22.795 --> 40:26.674
I'm not going anywhere until one of you
tells me what in Thra is going on here.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.633
Bah!

40:58.080 --> 41:01.292
Ah, there you are. It's about time!

41:02.084 --> 41:03.043
Bah!

41:07.423 --> 41:08.257
Ah.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.805
You've done well.

41:15.097 --> 41:19.226
You should be proud, little one.
Aughra has seen what she needed to see.

41:22.521 --> 41:23.397
What?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.441
What do you mean, "alliance"?

41:29.612 --> 41:31.238
Gelfling and Arathim?

41:31.614 --> 41:33.949
Hm. Hard to surprise a prophet.

41:35.826 --> 41:38.496
The creatures of Thra
align with one another.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.290
A Skeksis lies dying.

41:41.957 --> 41:42.791
Hm.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.586
All signs and portents come together.

41:46.253 --> 41:48.047
The Skeksis are desperate.

41:55.846 --> 41:56.680
A-ha!

41:57.223 --> 41:59.850
It's time to make my move.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.925
-Arathim.
-That's right.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.344
For so long,

42:35.928 --> 42:38.472
I have fought the Darkening alone.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.600
You're not alone anymore.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.228
The tide is turning.

42:44.937 --> 42:46.564
A resistance is forming.

42:47.314 --> 42:50.401
The Skeksis will fall,
and the Darkening will end.

42:50.484 --> 42:52.444
- Thank you, Deethra.
- I promise.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.947
Thank you...

42:55.823 --> 42:57.866
Your family's safely above ground.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.287
And the last of the Arathim
are going up now.

43:04.331 --> 43:05.583
It's time for you to go.

43:05.916 --> 43:08.210
You're not coming?

43:08.586 --> 43:11.463
No. I have to find the Glaive.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.842
You can't go alone.

43:17.928 --> 43:19.972
You should be with the ones you love.

43:20.848 --> 43:22.266
Don't worry about me.

43:24.393 --> 43:27.479
I've made it this far... somehow.

43:28.939 --> 43:29.815
But...

43:31.191 --> 43:32.109
I...

43:37.781 --> 43:40.326
The Darkening! It's coming!

43:41.118 --> 43:42.870
I cannot hold it back.

43:49.418 --> 43:50.794
Oh, Thra, have mercy!

43:50.878 --> 43:53.672
Leave the Sanctuary Tree alone!
You're killing it!

43:54.673 --> 43:56.759
-We have to stop them!

43:57.509 --> 43:59.261
You have to stop! Stop!

43:59.345 --> 44:00.971
Nothing can be done.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.891
Thra calls me home.

44:06.143 --> 44:06.977
No.

44:07.811 --> 44:08.646
No.

44:12.483 --> 44:15.069
It's all right. I will carry on.

44:15.235 --> 44:17.071
I will defeat the Darkening!

44:17.154 --> 44:19.156
The Darkening is pure energy.

44:19.239 --> 44:21.784
-It cannot be destroyed.
-Deet, they're coming!

44:21.867 --> 44:24.745
If the Darkening can't be destroyed,
then how do I defeat it?

44:24.828 --> 44:28.415
Like all energy,
it can only be transferred, moved!

44:28.499 --> 44:30.668
Teach me how. Please!

44:31.085 --> 44:33.253
Blessing or curse, I do not know.

44:33.837 --> 44:37.299
But my power... is yours.

45:11.917 --> 45:13.961
-I won't. I won't.

45:21.969 --> 45:22.803
Oh, Deet?

45:34.106 --> 45:35.441
Let me help you.

45:48.829 --> 45:51.415
What?

45:56.962 --> 45:58.338
Sweet Nurloc.

45:58.839 --> 45:59.965
You healed it.

46:00.382 --> 46:02.384
But... how?

46:03.385 --> 46:05.387
The Sanctuary Tree gifted me its power.

46:07.389 --> 46:09.141
One last act of kindness.

46:13.103 --> 46:15.397
Deet? Deet?

46:16.231 --> 46:17.107
Deet...

46:18.192 --> 46:19.485
Deet.

46:20.027 --> 46:21.069
Deet!

46:28.619 --> 46:29.453
Hold on.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.212
Don't let go.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.217
Rian?

46:45.928 --> 46:46.929
I've got you.
