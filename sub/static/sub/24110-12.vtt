he pushes his students,

10:32.457 --> 10:34.590
that killed our girl.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.593
Mom, you don't understand
anything about me, because...

10:37.637 --> 10:40.074
you never bothered to try.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.859
:
Why can't you hear me?

10:42.903 --> 10:45.253
MAN:
Good God.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.603
Why can't you love me?

10:50.475 --> 10:52.739
What is happening in this scene?

10:52.782 --> 10:55.350
A mother and her son
are fighting.

10:55.393 --> 10:58.440
I can see that, Claire,
but there's no subtext.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.834
And that dialogue?
"Why can't you hear me?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.574
Why can't you love me?"

11:02.618 --> 11:04.315
That is movie talk.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.491
I want real-life dialogue.
And the camerawork.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.103
Master, close-up, close-up.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.627
: God.
It's pedestrian.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.107
It's a rite of passage.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.935
Professor Mosher
does this to everybody.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.501
But he'll turn you
into a filmmaker.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.286
MOSHER:
But-but-but...

11:18.329 --> 11:21.768
it's not as anemic
as Spencer's last film.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.465
Our T.A.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.555
'Cause that just sucked
the life right out of me.

11:26.598 --> 11:29.384
There was no
point of view.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.995
If you don't exist
behind the camera,

11:32.039 --> 11:34.781
there can be nothing real
in front of it.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.652
What makes a film phony?

11:36.696 --> 11:39.786
ALL:
When it lacks authenticity.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.483
You want to grab your viewers?

11:41.526 --> 11:42.789
Then surprise them.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.792
Push reality to the limit.

11:45.835 --> 11:49.099
And I thought you were an
overdramatic professor.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.322
How well did you know Charlotte?

11:54.365 --> 11:56.890
Not too well.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.327
But she had a point of view,

11:59.370 --> 12:01.982
and an ear for dialogue
and humor.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.332
When everyone
was making horror movies,

12:04.375 --> 12:06.856
she was doing...
she was doing comedies.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.555
Charlotte was original,

12:10.599 --> 12:11.861
not a...

12:13.341 --> 12:16.387
...vacuous suck-up
like most of them.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.477
This is just terrible.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.698
I'm devastated.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.092
[cell phones buzzing
and chiming]

12:27.094 --> 12:30.793
Hey, somebody posted a film
to the class site.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.056
Geez, that's Charlotte.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.971
You all might want to
put your phones down.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.625
It gets very graphic.

12:36.668 --> 12:39.062
CLAIRE:
Oh, my God. Is this real?

12:39.106 --> 12:40.368
Is this why you're here?

12:40.411 --> 12:41.499
Who posted it?

12:41.543 --> 12:43.458
It's anonymous.

12:43.501 --> 12:46.113
Please tell me
this isn't real,

12:46.156 --> 12:47.723
that Charlotte isn't dead.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.812
It's gotta be Henry.
Look at the steampunk.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.074
Who's Henry?

12:51.118 --> 12:52.336
He's one of my students.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.686
Which one?
He's not here.

12:54.730 --> 12:58.212
He hasn't been to class
for a couple of days.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.822
DYLAN: Given the
calculated planning,

12:59.866 --> 13:01.302
I'd say we're dealing
with a psychopath,

13:01.345 --> 13:02.999
rather than a sociopath,
who'd be more impulsive.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.566
So he plays the film
in a theater,

13:04.609 --> 13:05.915
and then posts it online.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.830
Is it some kind
of homicidal exhibitionist?

13:07.874 --> 13:10.311
Or a "murder artist,"
like the Zodiac.

13:10.354 --> 13:13.227
By filming the murder
and sharing it with an audience,

13:13.270 --> 13:15.272
they can gain a sense
of power and fulfillment.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.447
And risk getting caught.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.319
That may not matter
if they get a rise

13:18.362 --> 13:19.624
out of inflicting pain.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.583
An arrogant psychopath
craves center stage,

13:21.626 --> 13:23.237
and they can never
get enough.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.372
There.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.477
Stand back.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.134
LIZZIE:
Police!

13:51.178 --> 13:52.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.921
Um, we're just filming a movie.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.400
What's going on?

14:00.491 --> 14:01.492
Yeah, we knew that.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.625
Are you okay?

14:03.668 --> 14:04.974
I'm fine.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.889
I'm tired of sitting
in this chair.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.369
You just ruined my shot.

14:13.069 --> 14:17.247
Charlotte's... dead?

14:17.291 --> 14:19.728
She was a beautiful person.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.122
And you knew,

14:22.165 --> 14:25.081
and you didn't tell me,
and we went ahead and did this?

14:25.125 --> 14:26.604
I didn't want to upset you.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.606
Yes, it's horrible,
but we have a deadline.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.870
Deadline?

14:30.913 --> 14:33.350
Charlotte's dead.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.875
He's so controlling,
he doesn't even let his actors

14:35.918 --> 14:37.572
use cell phones on set.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.182
Can I go, please?

14:39.226 --> 14:41.445
LIZZIE: We're going to need
a statement first.

14:41.489 --> 14:43.665
And, Henry, we'll need
to search your apartment.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.146
Search my apartment?
For what?

14:46.189 --> 14:47.669
Some of your colleagues
suggested

14:47.712 --> 14:49.845
that the film
in which Charlotte was killed

14:49.889 --> 14:51.803
was very similar
to your own work.

14:51.847 --> 14:55.633
The steampunk aesthetic
rests on the idea

14:55.677 --> 14:58.941
that if something looks good
it's because it is good.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.508
That film sucked.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.205
It was a steampunk rip-off.

15:06.427 --> 15:08.385
Wait, you think
that I had something

15:08.429 --> 15:09.734
to do with killing Charlotte?

15:09.778 --> 15:11.998
Oh, my God. Was I next?

15:12.041 --> 15:13.564
Were you gonna
kill me, too?

15:13.608 --> 15:14.914
I didn't kill anyone.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.916
I-I can't even kill a roach.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.221
So, then, it shouldn't
be a problem

15:18.265 --> 15:19.831
for us to take a look
at your place.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.224
Well, maybe you want
to get a warrant.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.704
Are you hiding something
up there?

15:22.747 --> 15:25.141
ACTRESS: What did he use
to kill Charlotte?

15:25.185 --> 15:26.795
A drill. Why?

15:28.362 --> 15:31.017
It used to be a drill
that killed my character,

15:31.060 --> 15:33.410
but he changed it to a
chain saw this morning.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.771
DYLAN:
Andy, I got your text.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.948
What happened

15:48.991 --> 15:50.340
ANDY:
She is. I'm not.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.560
She was caught being mean
to a boy online.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.693
School has a zero-tolerance
policy on cyber-bullying,

15:55.737 --> 15:58.348
so she has been suspended
for two days.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.698
Maddie was cyber

16:00.742 --> 16:02.352
It's-it's not the
Maddie I know--

16:02.396 --> 16:04.050
or at least thought
I knew-- but...

16:04.093 --> 16:06.400
I gotta get back to work.
I'll drop her off at home.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.576
What, by herself?

16:08.619 --> 16:10.143
All right,
I'll-I'll take her to the bar.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.666
She can eat
and do her homework there.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.581
Yeah, burger, fries and TV?

16:13.624 --> 16:16.323
You've really got
this "bad cop" thing down.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.673
DYLAN:
I'll take her to the precinct.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.762
She can work there.She's not a criminal, Dylan.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.503
We're not trying to
scare her straight.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.157
It wouldn't be
the worst thing for Maddie

16:24.200 --> 16:26.333
to be surrounded
by cops for a few hours.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.167
DISTORTED VOICE :
You deserve to die...

16:34.210 --> 16:35.777
Oh, my God.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.039
That's so gross.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.954
Harris, there
is a child here.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.434
Hey, you want
to raid our pantry?

16:40.477 --> 16:42.262
We got stale doughnuts
and gummy worms.

16:42.305 --> 16:45.091
No treats. Maddie has had some
disciplinary issues at school.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.180
Get your stuff. I'll find you
somewhere else to work.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.269
The search warrant
for Henry's place

16:49.312 --> 16:51.140
turned up some
steampunk costumes

16:51.184 --> 16:53.099
and props that matched
the video of Charlotte.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.883
And no drill.
Mmm.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.667
Uh...

16:56.711 --> 16:58.974
MADDIE:
Wow, look at those.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.455
Not good lighting in here.But I want to see the picture.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.805
DYLAN: Come on.LIZZIE: But the biggest
piece of evidence

17:03.848 --> 17:05.285
was Henry's laptop.What was on it?

17:05.328 --> 17:06.982
It's what was missing--
his hard drive.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.028
He said it was stolen,
but he never reported it.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.203
Shocking, huh?

17:10.246 --> 17:11.552
We should bring him in.

17:11.595 --> 17:12.944
Okay, Nancy Drew.
You can work here.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.337
No, she can't work here.Why not?

17:14.381 --> 17:15.643
Henry's on his way.

17:16.687 --> 17:18.472
Um, come on.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.344
Charlotte was killed
with a drill.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.694
You had a drill in a script
as a murder weapon,

17:23.738 --> 17:26.175
and then you changed it
to a chain saw. Why?

17:26.219 --> 17:27.872
Because somebody stole my drill.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.874
Right. Someone stole your
hard drive and your drill.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.180
I think you should maybe

17:31.224 --> 17:33.008
learn to take better
care of your stuff.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.184
Or maybe you got
rid of the drill

17:35.228 --> 17:37.186
after you used it
to kill Charlotte.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.753
Where were you
last night?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.711
Home.Are you sure?

17:43.149 --> 17:46.021
That is a ticket stub
for the Village East Cinema.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.892
The same showing where
Charlotte's body was discovered.

17:47.936 --> 17:50.156
We found this in your apartment.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.679
7:00 p.m.?

17:51.722 --> 17:53.246
That's hardly night.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.466
Professor Mosher wanted us
to see it for class.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.772
I left after
the opening sequence.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.340
It was one really cool
continuous shot.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.777
The rest is hacky.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.822
Guys, I know this
doesn't look good, but...

18:04.866 --> 18:06.346
I didn't do anything.

18:06.389 --> 18:08.522
Your classmate, Naomi,
says there was

18:08.565 --> 18:10.698
some animosity
between you and Charlotte.

18:10.741 --> 18:13.179
Yeah. Russ's seminar is...

18:13.222 --> 18:14.310
Russ?

18:14.354 --> 18:15.529
Mosher.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.183
Everyone pitches in,

18:17.226 --> 18:19.054
but his class
can get a little...

18:19.098 --> 18:20.099
Cutthroat?

18:20.142 --> 18:22.101
Competitive.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.668
Top student gets a grant
to make their thesis film.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.148
I make horror movies.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.063
Charlotte made dramedies.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.370
Every semester,
we were Russ's top two.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.894
She was number one.
You were two.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.723
I wouldn't kill for competition.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.116
How about for authenticity?

18:37.159 --> 18:40.075
Authenticity
isn't verisimilitude.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.470
If it were, then home movies
would be high art.

18:47.387 --> 18:51.347
Look, even though we competed,

18:51.391 --> 18:54.959
Charlotte couldn't
have been nicer.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.223
I didn't touch her.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.225
Let's see if the theater
security footage

18:59.268 --> 19:00.791
verifies your story.

19:06.797 --> 19:09.191
You keep calling
him "Russ."

19:09.235 --> 19:10.758
Do most students

19:10.801 --> 19:12.499
call Professor Mosher
by his first name?

19:12.542 --> 19:14.979
No, not most students.

19:15.023 --> 19:18.592
And he let you skip class
to make your films, right?

19:18.635 --> 19:20.202
Yeah, I have festival deadlines.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.986
And he's not just a teacher.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.814
He's a mentor.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.860
He's a true filmmaker.

19:26.991 --> 19:28.819
I'm a teacher, too.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.996
I wish my students talked
about me that way.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.564
What makes him
such a terrific teacher?

19:34.608 --> 19:39.221
Russ says that film
isn't just an art form.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.484
It's life.

19:41.528 --> 19:46.620
And like life,
trust is everything.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.405
I would do anything for Russ.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.712
Maybe that's what's missing
from my classroom.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.410
Not one of my students

19:54.454 --> 19:56.673
would trust me
with their hard drive.

19:58.675 --> 20:01.504
Why don't you tell me
about that?

20:13.647 --> 20:16.693
I heard you got in trouble
for bullying some boy.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.782
Mmm.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.307
I was bullied in middle school.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.960
Keith Calhoun.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.440
He used to push me around,

20:24.484 --> 20:27.008
and then one day
I just punched him in the jaw.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.315
Turned out he had a crush on me.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.014
Did you get in trouble?

20:33.057 --> 20:34.407
Uh-uh.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.278
I never got in trouble.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.671
I was a rule follower.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.063
Still am.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.370
We found some e-mails
from Charlotte to...

20:41.414 --> 20:42.589
Oh. Hey, Maddie.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.243
One sec.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.071
We found some e-mails from
Charlotte to a friend

20:47.115 --> 20:48.899
about liking a guy.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.511
She doesn't use his name,
but she calls it complicated.

20:51.554 --> 20:54.078
Okay, great. See if you
can find anything else.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.123
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.

21:01.042 --> 21:04.959
So, this boy you bullied--

21:05.002 --> 21:07.222
what's he like?

21:07.266 --> 21:08.876
His name is Aidan.

21:08.919 --> 21:11.052
He's new this year
and kind of shy.

21:11.095 --> 21:14.229
But if you get to know him,
he can be funny.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.057
It sounds like you like him.

21:16.100 --> 21:20.061
Why write mean
posts about him?

21:20.104 --> 21:21.541
I didn't.

21:21.584 --> 21:22.977
You didn't write the posts?

21:23.020 --> 21:24.674
No.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.720
I bet it was Mia.

21:26.763 --> 21:29.070
She's always borrowing my phone.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.680
Why didn't you
tell the principal?

21:30.724 --> 21:33.335
Mia is the most popular girl
in class.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.076
If I say something,
she'll make my life

21:35.119 --> 21:36.512
miserable forever.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.647
I bet it hurt Aidan,
thinking you'd say that.

21:42.518 --> 21:46.130
I tried to tell him
it wasn't me,

21:46.174 --> 21:48.611
but he didn't believe me.

21:50.526 --> 21:55.836
I really, really
do like Aidan, but...

21:55.879 --> 21:58.491
my friend Zoey told me
it's bad for your rating

21:58.534 --> 22:00.014
to like just one guy.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.102
Your rating?

22:01.145 --> 22:02.146
On ChitterPix.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.018
If you flirt around,

22:04.061 --> 22:06.237
you'll get more guys
to like your stuff.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.198
Then your rating goes up.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.765
That's the rule.

22:11.808 --> 22:15.769
Maddie, do you ever think
about breaking the rules?

22:16.813 --> 22:18.249
Do you?

22:20.426 --> 22:22.558
Nah, I don't think Henry did it.

22:22.602 --> 22:25.256
He kept a steady voice,
spoke in complete sentences,

22:25.300 --> 22:26.867
and didn't point a finger
at anyone.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.695
He does seem sincere,
but that doesn't explain

22:28.738 --> 22:30.392
how his drill
suddenly disappeared

22:30.436 --> 22:32.742
or why he gave Mosher
his hard drive.

22:32.786 --> 22:35.963
Mosher's impact on his students
is pretty impressive.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.443
Are you envious?

22:37.486 --> 22:39.575
DYLAN :
Of course not.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.231
Professor.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.973
Oh, I-I was just heading
to class.

22:46.016 --> 22:49.150
You're not seriously
considering Henry as a suspect?

22:49.193 --> 22:51.413
He may be an
intense young man,

22:51.457 --> 22:53.807
but he is not capable
of doing something like that.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.417
Why did he give you
his hard drive?

22:55.461 --> 22:57.245
To preserve his thesis film.

22:57.288 --> 22:58.768
He's been working on it
for months.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.422
It's the most important thing
in his life.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.250
See, he didn't want the...

23:02.293 --> 23:04.426
the footage to get
lost in evidence.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.297
So you're protecting
your student?

23:06.341 --> 23:07.603
I was.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.344
But I-I sure as
hell don't want

23:09.388 --> 23:11.259
to get in the way
of a murder investigation.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.130
The drive is locked
in the, uh, editing room.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.132
Uh, come on, come on.

23:15.176 --> 23:18.135
What's the rush?Well, I hate to be
late for class.

23:18.179 --> 23:19.223
But you're already late.

23:19.267 --> 23:20.616
We went to your classroom first,

23:20.660 --> 23:22.313
and your students said
you'd be here.

23:22.357 --> 23:23.663
What's so important here?

23:23.706 --> 23:25.621
Nothing.DYLAN: Professor...

23:25.665 --> 23:28.972
There are tells
people have when they're lying.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.844
Like the grooming gesture.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.194
You're asked a question,
and suddenly you feel the need

23:33.237 --> 23:36.327
to adjust your surroundings,
as you did by moving your phone.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.329
What's on your computer

23:38.373 --> 23:40.244
you don't want us to see?

23:47.730 --> 23:49.645
Charlotte.

23:49.689 --> 23:52.431
That's a film that she made
about subverting the male gaze.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.693
Hmm.

24:08.011 --> 24:11.493
Well, you really do
get to know your students.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.364
It's not what it looks like.

24:13.408 --> 24:16.019
That you're a married man
having an affair with a student,

24:16.063 --> 24:18.195
and that student is now dead?

24:18.239 --> 24:20.241
Professor Mosher,
did you kill Charlotte?

24:27.640 --> 24:29.859
TARU is going through
Henry's hard drive.

24:29.903 --> 24:32.383
Great. I pulled Charlotte's
e-mails with Mosher.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.385
It was more than just a fling.
She was in love with him.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.213
Oh.He told her he wouldn't
leave his wife.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.172
So she was pissed
he ended the relationship?

24:38.215 --> 24:40.217
In her last e-mail
three days ago,

24:40.261 --> 24:42.524
she threatened to go
public with the affair.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.047
Mosher never replied.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.440
There's your motive.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.007
But if Mosher
killed Charlotte,

24:47.050 --> 24:49.183
why would he make
such a display about it?

24:49.226 --> 24:51.402
Maybe to throw suspicion
on someone else?

24:51.446 --> 24:53.361
Or maybe Henry did it.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.450
Svengali syndrome.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.408
Manipulate someone
who reveres you

24:57.452 --> 24:59.062
to do your dirty work.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.543
Henry certainly
idolized his professor.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.068
Yeah, maybe Mosher
had Henry kill her.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.941
But he didn't know that Henry
would film it for authenticity.

25:07.984 --> 25:10.421
So, I spoke with Maddie.Mm-hmm.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.075
For what it's worth,
I don't think she did it.

25:12.119 --> 25:13.076
She likes that boy.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.382
She does?
Mm-hmm.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.862
Why didn't she
come out and say that?

25:15.905 --> 25:17.820
She's worried
that if she snitches,

25:17.864 --> 25:19.996
it's gonna ruin
her social status.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.650
How'd you get her
to talk to you?

25:21.694 --> 25:23.478
12-year-old girls
are complicated.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.827
I was one once.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.263
We should tell her principal.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.569
Maddie has no proof.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.571
These cyber things
can be tricky.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.139
Not for everyone.

25:32.182 --> 25:35.142
And yes, I am talking
about Julian.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.578
Thank you for telling me.

25:36.622 --> 25:39.973
See, doesn't it feel better
not to be all spy

25:40.016 --> 25:41.714
Feels tremendously better.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.543
Rule follower.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.893
Normally, you come to me
to assist in your hunt

25:46.936 --> 25:48.982
for some deranged mastermind,
but today

25:49.025 --> 25:50.984
you want me to hack
into a 12-year-old's

25:51.027 --> 25:53.116
bejeweled cell phone to discover

25:53.160 --> 25:55.597
who was, like,
being a total liar?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.730
I really need this information.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.253
The whole social fabric

25:59.296 --> 26:01.037
of Maddie's school life
is at stake.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.256
And she's a good kid.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.868
Very well.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.704
Hello, Kitty.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.622
It seems that a chap

26:20.666 --> 26:22.668
named Aidan was the object

26:22.711 --> 26:25.105
of numerous posts made
on Maddie's ChitterPix account.

26:25.148 --> 26:28.325
I thought those pic things
were meant to disappear.

26:28.369 --> 26:29.936
They do.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.546
Unless you request
an unscrupulous hacker

26:31.590 --> 26:33.592
to retrieve them
from the bowels of the Web.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.682
Looks like this girl
you're watching over

26:36.725 --> 26:37.944
can be quite cruel.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.815
This one suggests Aidan

26:39.859 --> 26:42.949
is an "assed-out
gutter-punk loser"

26:42.992 --> 26:45.125
who procures his threads
from the Salvation Army

26:45.168 --> 26:46.561
and will never be kissed.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.041
Ow, that hurts.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.825
Move on.
Keep checking.

26:52.741 --> 26:56.005
There are two accounts
linked to Maddie's profile.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.138
The second account
was created yesterday

26:58.181 --> 26:59.705
from an address in Chelsea.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.315
Maddie doesn't live in Chelsea.

27:01.358 --> 27:04.971
Joel and Nora Miller do.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.364
They have a daughter, Zoey, 12.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.410
Oh, Zoey's the same age
as Maddie.

27:09.453 --> 27:13.414
Looks as if young Zoey was
engaged in a spot of catfishing.

27:13.457 --> 27:16.809
So Zoey was impersonating Maddie

27:16.852 --> 27:18.811
so Maddie would take the blame,

27:18.854 --> 27:21.944
while also undermining
Maddie's friendship with Aidan.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.338
I'd rather face
a warlord in Chechnya

27:24.381 --> 27:26.383
than Zoey in a schoolyard.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.432
I'm glad I'm not young.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.086
LIZZIE:
Oh, that's good news.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.131
Maddie must be so relieved.

27:35.175 --> 27:37.351
Oh, she doesn't know yet.

27:37.394 --> 27:38.613
Well, I've got some bad news.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.962
We had to cut Henry loose.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.834
His hard drive came up clean,

27:41.877 --> 27:43.749
and we don't have enough
to hold him.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.620
And Mosher's alibi is airtight.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.491
He was with his wife
and another couple.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.102
That just doesn't make sense.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.625
If it's not Henry or Mosher...

27:50.669 --> 27:52.627
We're back to square one.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.107
Who would want
to kill Charlotte,

27:54.150 --> 27:56.152
make it look like Henry,
and film it?

27:56.196 --> 27:57.632
ANDY: Hey, Dyl, you home?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.678
We got pad see-ew from
the place around the corner.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.202
I gotta go.
I'll speak to you soon.

28:02.245 --> 28:03.943
Great news, Maddie.

28:03.986 --> 28:06.162
I cleared your name
with Principal Mathis.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.642
You can go back
to school tomorrow.

28:07.686 --> 28:08.817
Way to go.

28:08.861 --> 28:10.819
Um, did you tell
Principal Mathis

28:10.863 --> 28:11.820
that Mia did it?

28:11.864 --> 28:13.474
No, it was some girl named Zoey.

28:13.517 --> 28:15.041
Zoey?

28:15.084 --> 28:16.695
Yeah.
Uh...

28:16.738 --> 28:18.740
she wouldn't do anything
like that.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.438
Uh, well, she did.
I can show you the proof.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.314
Why can't you just mind
your own business?

28:27.357 --> 28:28.663
I don't want to go back

28:28.707 --> 28:30.360
to that stupid school
ever again.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.454
Zoey is her best friend.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.413
Or at least she thought so.

28:39.456 --> 28:40.762
Oh.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.285
I'll go talk to her.No, no. I'll do it.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.417
I'll do it.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.766
I fixed the problem.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.377
I'll go and fix
the solution.

28:57.910 --> 28:59.607
Go away.

29:00.869 --> 29:03.742
I don't know if you know this,
but I have

29:03.785 --> 29:06.353
way too many degrees
in human behavior.

29:06.396 --> 29:08.747
And they don't come in handy
very often,

29:08.790 --> 29:11.837
but I do know that you
shouldn't take the blame

29:11.880 --> 29:13.316
for something
that's not your fault.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.755
Congratulations on your degrees,

29:16.798 --> 29:19.409
but you don't understand
how it works.

29:19.453 --> 29:21.760
Then teach me, Maddie.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.413
Tell me what happened.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.546
Tell me so I can understand.

29:25.589 --> 29:28.549
But you can't understand.

29:28.592 --> 29:30.769
Maybe not.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.858
I didn't have to deal
with cyber-bullying

29:32.901 --> 29:36.252
or Twitter or ChitterPix or...

29:36.296 --> 29:38.602
Face-anything.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.344
But I was pimply.

29:41.388 --> 29:44.043
And gay,
and terrible at sports.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.567
I do know
you have to learn

29:46.610 --> 29:50.179
who to trust, who not to trust,

29:50.223 --> 29:53.792
but above all,
to trust yourself.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.188
Zoey's my best friend,

29:59.232 --> 30:02.626
but she's been really mean
to me lately.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.586
She's been making fun
of my posts,

30:05.629 --> 30:08.197
and she even called me
a "postaholic"

30:08.241 --> 30:09.633
because my Pix rating

30:09.677 --> 30:10.765
is going up.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.288
What's a Pix rating?

30:12.332 --> 30:15.074
You get points every time
people view your posts.

30:15.117 --> 30:16.771
The more followers
you have,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.426
the higher your rating is.

30:19.469 --> 30:23.778
Without a high rating,
it's like you don't exist.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.041
Like...

30:26.085 --> 30:28.652
people don't even
know you're there.

30:30.089 --> 30:33.396
You are so much more
than an online rating.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.094
Hey.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.922
I survived.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.837
You will, too.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.104
She was his top student.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.758
For the first time,
she felt like she belonged.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.891
The steampunk aesthetic
rests on the idea

30:49.935 --> 30:52.241
that something looks good
because it is good.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.852
That film sucked.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.331
It was a steampunk rip-off.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.899
If you don't exist
behind the camera,

30:57.943 --> 31:00.859
then there can be nothing real
in front of it.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.126
Like no one knows you're there.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.259
Hey, Nancy Drew,

31:10.303 --> 31:12.131
I think you just helped me
with my case.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.741
I did?
Yeah.

31:13.784 --> 31:16.091
I've, uh, gotta get to work,

31:16.135 --> 31:19.051
but I know that Andy wants
to spend some time with you

31:19.094 --> 31:20.791
because-- guess what--

31:20.835 --> 31:23.272
you've got a pretty high
rating with us, too.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.752
Thanks, Dylan.

31:24.795 --> 31:25.927
You guys are trill.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.628
So, Mosher shines
a spotlight

31:31.672 --> 31:33.326
on Charlotte and Henry,
his two favorites,

31:33.369 --> 31:34.849
but what about
the other students?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.590
They don't get the validation
or the attention.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.461
It's like they're
not even there.

31:38.505 --> 31:41.160
Explains why you'd post that
video killing Charlotte online.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.989
Suddenly, your film becomes the
most talked about one around.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.513
Right. Now imagine
being those students,

31:46.556 --> 31:49.646
watching Charlotte and Henry
get all the praise.

31:49.690 --> 31:50.952
There was that girl, Claire,

31:50.996 --> 31:52.432
whose movie we saw
Mosher critique.

31:52.475 --> 31:53.955
And then the T.A.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.478
Mosher slammed his movie,
said it was anemic.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.958
Said it sucked the life
out of him.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.917
He humiliated
the poor guy

31:58.960 --> 32:01.093
in front of everyone,
and what did the T.A. do?

32:01.136 --> 32:02.790
He just took it passively,
like he didn't

32:02.833 --> 32:05.314
have the validation
to defend his movie or himself.

32:05.358 --> 32:08.361
But there may be a fury building
with every cut to his ego,

32:08.404 --> 32:10.015
just waiting
for the right trigger.

32:10.058 --> 32:13.888
So you knock off Charlotte,
and then frame Henry?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.890
Use his steampunk style,
steal his drill.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.022
But why?

32:17.065 --> 32:18.632
Jealousy
Resentment?

32:18.675 --> 32:20.329
Let's ask the professor.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.204
I'm not talking
without my lawyer.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.988
You're no longer
a suspect, Professor,

32:27.032 --> 32:29.512
but you may be able to help us
find who killed Charlotte.

32:29.556 --> 32:31.210
Tell us about
your T.A.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.689
Spencer?
Yeah.

32:32.733 --> 32:34.343
He's talentless,

32:34.387 --> 32:36.998
but he makes up for it with
a strong sense of entitlement.

32:37.042 --> 32:39.348
He's a rich kid
who thinks he's a filmmaker.

32:39.392 --> 32:42.047
His parents made a very,
uh, generous donation

32:42.090 --> 32:43.352
to the university.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.746
I gave them an assignment

32:45.789 --> 32:49.184
to, uh, film something
authentic, personal,

32:49.228 --> 32:51.752
and Spencer turned
in a video essay

32:51.795 --> 32:53.884
on why he wants
to make films.

32:53.928 --> 32:56.322
SPENCER :
My name is Spencer Baymoore.

32:56.365 --> 32:58.933
Welcome to our beautiful
Baymoore home.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.502
Just another canvas on which
to make your dreams come true.

33:02.545 --> 33:05.418
Uh, Spencer... his parents
made their fortune

33:05.461 --> 33:08.073
flying around the world
building overpriced homes.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.075
Spencer was raised
by nannies.

33:10.118 --> 33:11.641
Mommy

33:11.685 --> 33:13.165
Come say hi.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.036
Oh, that's right--
Mommy and Daddy

33:15.080 --> 33:16.951
are too busy
designing dream homes.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.300
Thinking they're better.

33:18.344 --> 33:19.606
But I don't care.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.956
Because I'm better than you.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.132
"I'm better than you."

33:24.176 --> 33:25.438
Isn't that what
the killer said

33:25.481 --> 33:26.613
right before he
killed Charlotte?

33:26.656 --> 33:29.616
Did Spencer ever express anger?

33:29.659 --> 33:30.791
Show signs of violence?

33:30.834 --> 33:32.619
No. No, I told him last week

33:32.662 --> 33:34.273
that he wasn't
gonna get the grant.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.796
That the footage he screened
wasn't good enough.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.450
He seemed fine with it.

33:37.493 --> 33:39.278
When you told him
he wasn't getting the grant,

33:39.321 --> 33:40.670
did you tell him who was?

33:40.714 --> 33:41.802
Sure.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.630
Charlotte or Henry.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.719
Oh, my God.Where does he live?

33:45.762 --> 33:47.634
I'll look in the
school database.

33:47.677 --> 33:50.506
There's another anonymous link.Open it, please.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.902
DISTORTED VOICE:
I will premiere my next film

33:54.945 --> 33:59.124
very soon, and it will be
unforgettable.

33:59.167 --> 34:00.821
Professor Mosher, I'm sorry

34:00.864 --> 34:05.130
you find my films anemic,
lifeless,

34:05.173 --> 34:08.089
but I will make you proud.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.222
Please, please, help me!

34:10.265 --> 34:11.614
Help me!MOSHER: Henry.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.399
DISTORTED VOICE:
You want us to grab our viewers?

34:14.487 --> 34:16.402
Surprise them?

34:16.445 --> 34:19.405
To push the limits of reality?

34:21.233 --> 34:23.191
You want authenticity?

34:25.063 --> 34:27.065
This film is live.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.551
No one in Spencer's apartment.
They searched the campus, too,

34:35.595 --> 34:37.988
and his parents are
on vacation in Italy.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.468
A fragile
mind like Spencer's

34:39.512 --> 34:41.557
may have snapped when he didn't
get that grant.

34:41.601 --> 34:43.342
And instead of punishing
the one he idolized,

34:43.385 --> 34:45.344
he may have gone after
the competition.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.476
I'm not getting anything.Yeah, there's
no sign of Spencer

34:47.520 --> 34:49.130
on the video yet.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.653
Why can't we track
where he's streaming from?

34:50.697 --> 34:53.178
The killer's using an onion
router to scramble his IP.

34:53.221 --> 34:54.875
The router sends out
fake IP addresses

34:54.918 --> 34:56.181
every two to three seconds

34:56.224 --> 34:57.573
to hide his real location.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.662
It's like finding a needle
in a stack of needles

34:59.706 --> 35:01.795
and somebody keeps
adding needles.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.449
Okay, so we saw him
two hours ago.

35:03.492 --> 35:04.145
Just search within

35:04.189 --> 35:06.669
a 20-mile radius.

35:06.713 --> 35:08.149
I'm getting recurring IPs
in Brooklyn.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.542
LIZZIE: Okay, we'll head
in that direction.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.631
And give me an update
with the actual address

35:11.674 --> 35:13.589
as soon as you have it.It may take some time.

35:13.633 --> 35:14.808
Should we call Julian?

35:14.851 --> 35:16.418
Let's keep this NYPD.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.420
DISTORTED VOICE:
Now it's golden boy Henry's

35:18.464 --> 35:20.727
turn to be anemic.

35:20.770 --> 35:23.077
His punishment:

35:23.121 --> 35:25.775
death by exsanguination.

35:25.819 --> 35:29.214
If Spencer drains Henry's blood,
he will be dead within the hour.

35:29.257 --> 35:30.780
Make the call. Come on.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.612
JULIAN : His IP
spoofer's pretty elaborate.

35:36.656 --> 35:37.961
I'll try finding an exploit in.

35:38.005 --> 35:39.789
He's looking cyanotic.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.140
If we don't get there in time,
he'll go into cardiac arrest.

35:44.620 --> 35:45.795
I got in.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.797
Now just one more step.

35:47.841 --> 35:50.974
There. I've narrowed it down
to three locations.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.237
Three doesn't help us.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.021
Julian, are any of
these addresses

35:54.064 --> 35:55.849
at one of Spencer's
family's sites?

35:57.459 --> 35:59.331
Yes. 88 Elm.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.637
Recently acquired
by Baymoore Homes.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.639
That's where our killer is.
Uh, take the next left.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.208
Text EMS the address,

36:07.252 --> 36:08.775
and tell them to
bring units of blood.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.690
We're not going to make it
in time.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.170
We have to stall Spencer.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.562
How?

36:13.606 --> 36:15.825
Stop the only thing
that matters to him.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.132
JULIAN:

37:34.774 --> 37:37.037
This is gonna be better

37:41.737 --> 37:43.783
this is true authenticity.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.221
Exactly what

37:47.265 --> 37:49.049
DYLAN: The movie's
over, Spencer.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.920

the bad guy die.

Wait. He's still alive.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.769
...you are under arrest
for murder.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.467
Take him away.

38:16.511 --> 38:17.947
Is he okay?Yeah, he's good.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.229
Stop.

38:39.273 --> 38:41.014
She looks so happy.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.016
We found it on
her computer.

38:43.059 --> 38:44.887
These are the outtakes
from her thesis film.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.976
We're compiling everything

38:47.020 --> 38:49.588

how much this means.

38:55.507 --> 38:56.856

38:56.899 --> 38:58.423

39:09.956 --> 39:11.566

39:11.610 --> 39:14.264
Henry? Okay. He's recovering.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.877
I miss our kid.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.009
Yeah, it's a little quiet
around here, huh?

39:20.053 --> 39:22.229
Feels like an empty nest.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.407
The responsibility
is a little crazy, huh?

39:26.451 --> 39:30.542
Yeah, and you must be exhausted
after being bad cop.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.022
I'm good cop.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.984
And that works because,
as a behavioral specialist,

39:38.027 --> 39:41.030
I cannot be the good cop.

39:41.074 --> 39:44.425
Thank you for being
there for Maddie.

39:46.949 --> 39:49.865
You know, I think,
despite her school suspension

39:49.909 --> 39:52.433
and witnessing
a filmed murder, she had fun.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.392
She did. She-she
definitely did.

39:54.435 --> 39:55.915
Yeah.
Yeah, and she's
still breathing.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.744
We didn't kill her.Which is something.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.790
You know, I... I think it'll
be easier when it's our kid.

40:01.834 --> 40:05.054

be, you know?
