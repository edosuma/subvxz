IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.408 --> 00:11.379
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.614
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.647 --> 00:15.549
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.583 --> 00:17.085
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.118 --> 00:19.253
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.255
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.325
- I DON'T WANNA MOVE.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.127
- IT'S 6 FEET, FIN.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.262
- YOU'RE ALL
STILL TOO COMPLACENT.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.131
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE,
I'LL SAY IT AGAIN.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.133
IT'S A NEW YEAR,
I WANNA SHAKE THINGS UP.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.534
- I LIKE MY OLD DESK.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.203
- WELL, WE CAN GET YOU
A GRIEF COUNSELOR.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.704
- SAYS THE GUY
THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO MOVE.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.372
- I'M GONE A FEW MONTHS

00:38.406 --> 00:39.440
AND YOU'RE REARRANGING
THE FURNITURE?

00:39.473 --> 00:40.774
WHAT'S NEXT, CARPETING?

00:40.808 --> 00:42.610
PAPER TOWELS
IN THE MEN'S ROOM?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.378
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE MAN
WHO CAME IN FROM COLD CASE.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.080
- WELCOME BACK.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.315
- YOU KNOW, EVERYONE SAYS
THE DNA BANK AT THE STATE

00:47.348 --> 00:49.317
IS A GOOD THING.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.352
DOWNSIDE, SOMEBODY'S GOTTA
GO THROUGH THE CASES.

00:51.385 --> 00:56.257
UPSIDE, I GOT A HIT ON AN
UNSOLVED RAPE/MURDER FROM '87.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.391
- THAT'S NOT COLD,
THAT'S FRIGID.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.293
WHAT DO WE GOT
ON THE SUSPECT SO FAR?

00:59.327 --> 01:01.729
- BRIAN TRAYMOR, 52.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.831
PICKED UP IN MIAMI
ON COCAINE POSSESSION.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.333
- BY THE TIME
HIS DNA WAS PROCESSED,

01:05.366 --> 01:06.734
HE HAD SERVED
HIS THREE MONTHS.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.402
HE'S BEING RELEASED TOMORROW.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.271
- I'LL HAVE THE D.A.
START THE EXTRADITION PAPERS.

01:10.304 --> 01:13.441
BENSON, AMARO,
BOOK THE NEXT FLIGHT TO MIAMI.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.543
- WHOA, CAP.
I GOT A FEEL FOR MIAMI.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.777
I WAS WORKING DOWN THERE
UNDERCOVER.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.246
- UH-HUH.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.414
WELL, YOU AND ROLLINS
WORK THE CASE FROM HERE.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.550
RE-INTERVIEW WITNESSES,
TRACK DOWN EVIDENCE.

01:22.583 --> 01:26.420
I DON'T WANNA RELY
ON 25-YEAR-OLD DNA.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.291
- SOUTH FLORIDA.

01:30.324 --> 01:33.294
I GOTTA SAY,
IT'S OVERRATED.

01:33.327 --> 01:36.264
- WHAT, THE SUN,
THE COFFEE, PEOPLE?

01:36.297 --> 01:38.266
- THE HEAT, THE BUGS.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.867
- REALLY?

01:39.900 --> 01:42.570
THAT CUBAN SANDWICH?
- NOT SO MUCH.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.773
- I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COMPLAIN
ABOUT THE BAHAMAS.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.342
- [scoffs]

01:48.376 --> 01:49.810
- DETECTIVES.
YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.380
- BRIAN TRAYMOR
IS BEING RELEASED TODAY.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.182
- YEAH.
- OKAY, SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

01:54.215 --> 01:55.616
- FBI BEAT YOU TO THE PUNCH.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.489
- DANA.

02:01.522 --> 02:05.326
- OLIVIA. HEY.
LONG TIME.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.795
- FBI AGENT LEWIS,
THIS IS MY PARTNER NICK AMARO.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.264
- NICE TO MEET YOU, SUNSHINE.
- YOU TOO.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.566
HEY, CAN I ASK
WHAT THE FBI'S INTEREST IS

02:12.600 --> 02:14.402
IN A NEW YORK COLD CASE?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.404
- WE THINK HE'S A SERIAL.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.739
HE'S OUR PRIME SUSPECT
IN THREE OTHER RAPE/MURDERS--

02:18.772 --> 02:20.774
SACRAMENTO, PHILADELPHIA,
WASHINGTON,

02:20.808 --> 02:22.410
BESIDES TWO IN NEW YORK.

02:22.443 --> 02:26.314
- BUT THE DNA MATCHED
A MANHATTAN CASE MAKES IT OURS.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.182
AND THESE AREN'T
FEDERAL CRIMES.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.550
- HOW ABOUT
WE WORK TOGETHER ON THIS?

02:29.583 --> 02:30.818
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, NICK,

02:30.851 --> 02:32.720
WHEN SHE ASKS,
IT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.390
- YEAH, I'M GETTING THAT.
[buzzer]

02:38.359 --> 02:39.593
DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR?

02:39.627 --> 02:41.362
- I'M AS SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.863
- NYPD.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.298
BRIAN TRAYMOR.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.534
WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR YOUR ARREST.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.336
- LOOK, I DID MY TIME
ON THE COKE BUST.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.671
I--THEY SAID I COULD GO HOME.
- BOY, YOU WERE MISINFORMED.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.705
- YEAH, WE'LL BE TAKING YOU

02:51.739 --> 02:53.341
BACK TO
YOUR OLD STOMPING GROUNDS.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.409
NEW YORK CITY.
- FOR WHAT?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.411
- RAPE...
AND MURDER.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.712
IT'S TAKEN 25 YEARS,

02:58.746 --> 03:01.715
BUT YOUR PAST
HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO YOU.

03:05.453 --> 03:08.422
[dramatic music]

03:08.456 --> 03:16.464
*

03:53.401 --> 03:54.735
- BRIAN TRAYMOR WAS PARALYZED

03:54.768 --> 03:56.437
FROM THE WAIST DOWN
IN A BUS ACCIDENT,

03:56.470 --> 03:57.871
APRIL 1988,

03:57.905 --> 04:00.308
THREE MONTHS AFTER
HIS LAST SUSPECTED ATTACK.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.576
- WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
HIS ABSENCE FROM THE SYSTEM

04:02.610 --> 04:04.512
FOR OVER TWO DECADES.
- MM-HMM.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.913
- ARE WE SURE HE'S GOOD
FOR ALL FIVE?

04:05.946 --> 04:07.615
- IT'S THE SAME PATTERN.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.750
ALL OF THE WOMEN WERE RAPED,
THEN TIED UP,

04:09.783 --> 04:11.619
AND STRANGLED
WITH ATHLETIC TAPE.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.953
HE WORE LATEX GLOVES

04:12.986 --> 04:14.655
AND STUFFED 'EM
IN THE WOMEN'S MOUTHS.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.790
- TURNS OUT,
FROM '86 TO '88,

04:16.824 --> 04:18.892
BRIAN WAS THE ASSISTANT
EQUIPMENT MANAGER

04:18.926 --> 04:21.795
TO THE ATLANTA BARONS
BASKETBALL TEAM.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.332
THEIR AWAY GAME SCHEDULE
PUTS HIM IN EVERY CITY

04:24.365 --> 04:26.367
OR ON A DAY OFF
AT THE TIMES OF THE MURDERS.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.070
- DNA WASN'T USUALLY RUN IN '87.
HOW'D WE GET LUCKY?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.772
- COLD CASE IN SACRAMENTO
AND NEW YORK

04:31.805 --> 04:34.375
RAN DNA FROM RAPE KITS
TEN YEARS AGO.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.677
NO HITS UNTIL TRAYMOR
WAS ARRESTED.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.879
SWABS MATCH TRAYMOR'S DNA

04:38.912 --> 04:41.549
ON THE SACRAMENTO VICTIM,
THERESA GREY,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.551
AND THE FIRST NEW YORK VICTIM.
- GINA MANTOS.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.085
PHILADELPHIA, WASHINGTON
NEVER RAN DNA,

04:45.118 --> 04:47.655
SO WE PUT IN A REQUEST
TO EXPEDITE.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.989
- WELL,
HOW ABOUT A CONFESSION?

04:49.022 --> 04:51.359
DID TRAYMOR GIVE ANYTHING UP
ON THE PLANE RIDE?

04:51.392 --> 04:52.860
- JUST LOOKED OUT
THE WINDOW,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.094
BUT HE DID WAIVE HIS RIGHT
TO COUNSEL.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.863
- CAPTAIN,
BEFORE HE CHANGES HIS MIND,

04:55.896 --> 04:57.064
HOW ABOUT NICK AND I
TAKE A RUN AT HIM?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.532
- I WAS PART
OF THE INITIAL PROFILING.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.100
I WOULD APPRECIATE
SITTING IN.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.935
- AND WE APPRECIATE
YOU BEING HERE,

05:01.969 --> 05:03.804
BUT THIS IS NYPD'S CASE
AND WE'LL TAKE THE LEAD.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.905
[cell phone chimes]
- FINE.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.840
BUT I WILL BE OBSERVING.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.776
MY BOSSES ARE
UNDERSTANDABLY ANXIOUS.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.043
- HOLD UP,
WE GOT A BREAK.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.979
THE FIRST NEW YORK VIC,
GINA--

05:12.012 --> 05:14.415
FOUND HER FORMER ROOMMATE.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.552
- GINA WENT TO THE GARDEN
A LOT BACK THEN.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.887
- SHE WAS A BASKETBALL FAN?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.922
- MORE THE PLAYERS
THAN THE SPORT.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.991
SHE REALLY WANTED
TO MEET MICHAEL JORDAN.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.593
- CAN WE ASK YOU
TO LOOK AT SOME PHOTOS

05:25.626 --> 05:27.461
OF A POSSIBLE SUSPECT?

05:27.495 --> 05:30.030
- UH...SERIOUSLY?
IT WAS SUCH A LONG TIME AGO.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.965
- THE DNA MAY BE
CATCHING UP WITH HIM.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.369
HE MIGHT FINALLY
HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT HE DID.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.144
- MAYBE.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.979
YEAH, HE LOOKED
RIGHT PAST ME.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.615
MADE A FOOL OUT OF HIMSELF

05:47.648 --> 05:48.982
TRYING TO GET
A MINNESOTA GIRL'S ATTENTION.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.819
- WHERE WAS THAT?
- A SPORTS BAR NEAR THE GARDEN.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.387
- THE NIGHT
THE GIRL WAS KILLED?

05:53.421 --> 05:54.988
- A COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.891
YOU KNOW, I THINK HE TOLD GINA
THAT HE WORKED FOR THE TEAM.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.027
I WAS SO JEALOUS.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.729
GUYS ALWAYS HITTING ON HER.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.732
HER FOLKS PAYING HER RENT.

06:04.765 --> 06:08.569
THEN I WALKED IN
AND FOUND HER.

06:08.602 --> 06:12.773
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
I JUST TRIED TO FORGET ALL THAT.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.545
- GINA MANTOS.

06:17.578 --> 06:21.915
YOU REMEMBER HER.
- [sighs]

06:21.949 --> 06:24.752
GINA?
- MM-HMM.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.020
- IT DOESN'T RING A BELL.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.423
BUT SHE'S CUTE.
- SHE'S DEAD!

06:29.457 --> 06:30.891
- YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

06:30.924 --> 06:31.992
- SO YOU'VE NEVER SEEN HER,
BRIAN?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.727
- HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS?
WHAT, 20 YEARS?

06:33.761 --> 06:35.028
- 25.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.930
YOU WOULD'VE MET HER
HERE IN NEW YORK.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.766
- YEAH, YOU WORKED
FOR THE ATLANTA BARONS.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.002
THEY HAD A GAME THAT NIGHT.
YOU WERE IN TOWN.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.671
- HER ROOMMATE SAYS
THAT SHE SAW YOU TALKING TO HER

06:43.704 --> 06:46.173
IN A BAR
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.841
THE BARONS
WERE ALSO IN TOWN.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.209
- LISTEN, SWEETHEART,
YOU--

06:49.242 --> 06:52.045
YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN
I TALKED TO IN THE '80s?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.081
- YEAH, YOU SEE GIRLS
AT GAMES.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.949
YOU LURE THEM IN,

06:55.983 --> 06:58.786
TELL 'EM THAT YOU'RE
SOME BIG DEAL ON THE TEAM.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.087
- YEAH, WELL,
I NEVER LIED ABOUT MY JOB.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.722
- YEAH, BUT THESE GIRLS--

07:01.755 --> 07:05.225
THEY DIDN'T WANNA MEET
THE ASSISTANT EQUIPMENT MANAGER.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.960
THEY WANTED
TO MEET THE PLAYERS.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.796
- I DID ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH?

07:08.829 --> 07:09.930
- RUNOFF WAS FINE.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.499
- YEAH? YOU DO ALL RIGHT
WITH GINA?

07:11.532 --> 07:12.900
- MAYBE.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.101
I WAS VERY DIFFERENT
BACK THEN.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.469
[laughing]

07:15.503 --> 07:17.104
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WASN'T
IN THIS...

07:17.137 --> 07:19.072
[clears throat]
CHAIR.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.074
- BACK WHEN YOU COULD WALK.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.076
WHEN YOU COULD HAVE SEX.

07:23.110 --> 07:27.615
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
ME, IF I WERE YOU...

07:27.648 --> 07:30.484
I'D REMEMBER THAT.

07:30.518 --> 07:34.054
- OH, YEAH?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.759
YEAH, MAN.
MAYBE I REMEMBER MEETING HER.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.793
- WELL, YOU DID
MORE THAN THAT.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.963
YOUR DNA WAS FOUND
ON HER BODY.

07:42.996 --> 07:46.934
- WE KNOW
THAT YOU WERE WITH HER.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.869
- OKAY, SO WHAT?
I--

07:48.902 --> 07:51.539
[scoffs]
I WENT HOME WITH HER.

07:51.572 --> 07:55.108
DON'T MEAN I KILLED HER.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.977
- BRIAN,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.614
THAT BUS THAT HIT YOU
BROKE YOUR SPINAL CORD.

08:00.648 --> 08:04.051
IT DIDN'T JUST CRIPPLE YOU.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.755
IT MADE YOU IMPOTENT.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.759
YOU'VE HAD 25 YEARS
TO THINK ABOUT THAT ACCIDENT.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.728
YOU EVER THINK IT WAS KARMA?

08:20.100 --> 08:21.735
- MR. AND MRS. STANGER.

08:21.769 --> 08:24.071
I'M DETECTIVE ROLLINS.
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.039
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CALLED US.

08:26.073 --> 08:29.109
YOU SAID YOU KNOW
WHO KILLED OUR DAUGHTER?

08:29.142 --> 08:32.145
- UH, THIS WAY.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.549
- NO, NONE OF THESE MEN
LOOK FAMILIAR.

08:35.583 --> 08:39.753
- KIRA WOULDN'T HAVE GONE
WITH A MAN LIKE THAT.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.089
- WAS YOUR DAUGHTER
A BASKETBALL FAN?

08:42.122 --> 08:44.592
- NO! SHE WENT TO BENNINGTON,
STUDIED MUSIC.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.059
SHE HATED SPORTS.

08:46.093 --> 08:49.229
- WHEN KIRA
MOVED TO NEW YORK,

08:49.262 --> 08:50.864
YOU WERE LIVING IN VERMONT.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.667
- STILL ARE.
SAME HOUSE KIRA GREW UP IN.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.970
- IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW

08:57.004 --> 08:58.772
EVERYTHING THAT KIRA
DID FOR FUN.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.173
- WE KNEW.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.577
WE MET NOAH, HER FIANCE,
TWO WEEKS AFTER SHE MET HIM.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.145
- THEY WERE SO IN LOVE.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.947
- THAT'S HOW WE KNEW WHAT
THE POLICE TOLD US WAS CRAP,

09:06.980 --> 09:10.851
THAT KIRA WAS KILLED
BY A MAN SHE MET IN A BAR.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.786
SHE NEVER WOULD'VE OPENED
THE DOOR TO A STRANGER.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.623
- SHE WAS A KINDERGARTEN
TEACHER.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.091
NOAH WAS TRAVELING
ON BUSINESS.

09:18.125 --> 09:22.095
SHE TOLD ME
HOW MUCH SHE MISSED HIM.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.998
THIS MAN YOU SAY YOU HAVE,

09:25.032 --> 09:28.068
HE DIDN'T KILL OUR DAUGHTER.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.741
- OKAY, BRIAN,
LET'S GO OVER IT AGAIN.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.910
SACRAMENTO, FEBRUARY '87.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.112
THERESA,
YOUR FIRST VICTIM.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.748
YOU RAPED AND MURDERED HER.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.115
- YEAH, YEAH.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.252
SHE SCREAMED
WHEN I DID HER.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.821
- NUMBER TWO. PHILLY.
MARLENE.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.790
- YES.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.959
- THREE. WASHINGTON.
DIANA.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.628
- YEAH.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.864
SHE JUST LAID THERE.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.632
- FOUR. GINA.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.801
- SHE WAS NUTS.
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

10:00.834 --> 10:01.969
- YEAH, WE WANNA MAKE SURE
FOR THE RECORD.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.671
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHATEVER, YEAH.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.405
I DID 'EM ALL.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.107
WHAT CAN I SAY?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.943
ME AND THE LADIES JUST...
NEVER WORK OUT.

10:09.977 --> 10:13.013
- AND NUMBER FIVE.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.216
KIRA.
NEW YORK.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.687
- NO.
I NEVER MET HER.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.831
- IT'S BEEN OVER 15 HOURS,

10:30.864 --> 10:32.099
AND HE STILL HASN'T
CONFESSED TO THE FIFTH?

10:32.132 --> 10:33.300
- KIRA STANGER.
WHAT DO WE HAVE ON HER?

10:33.333 --> 10:35.168
- YORKVILLE.
SAME M.O.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.404
RAPED, TIED UP,
STRANGLED WITH ATHLETIC TAPE,

10:37.437 --> 10:40.040
UH, LATEX GLOVES
STUFFED IN THE MOUTH.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.042
- I TALKED TO HER FOLKS.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.011
THEY INSIST KIRA WOULD
NEVER PICK UP A STRANGER.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.013
- DID Y'ALL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AT THE RAPE KIT?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.781
- THEY RUN ALL THE FORENSICS?

10:47.815 --> 10:50.083
- YEAH, IT'S NEGATIVE
ON PRINTS, BLOOD, AND FLUIDS.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.086
- DID THEY SAVE THE TAPE,
THE LATEX GLOVES?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.322
DID WE RUN TOUCH DNA
IN THE GLOVES?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.157
- WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE
ANOTHER CALL TO COLD CASE.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.092
- THEY GET LONELY.
LET'S PAY 'EM A VISIT.

10:59.126 --> 11:02.095
TELL 'EM THE FBI
IS BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.799
OH, AND TAKE MUNCH.
THEY LOVE HIM OVER THERE.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.070
- I ALREADY SENT THE KIRA
STANGER RAPE KIT TO THE LAB.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.005
- IT WAS NEGATIVE.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.440
WE'RE HOPING TO FIND TOUCH DNA
FROM OTHER EVIDENCE.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.042
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT WAS COLLECTED AT THE SCENE?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.944
- I HAVE THE ACCESSION LOG
RIGHT HERE.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.812
- YEAH.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.082
OKAY, LATEX GLOVES,
ATHLETIC TAPE.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.417
GOT FINGERNAIL CLIPPINGS
FROM THE VIC.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.920
WE COULD GET LUCKY.

11:26.954 --> 11:30.423
- OH, CAREFUL.
THIS THING'S FALLING APART.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.395
UH-OH!

11:35.428 --> 11:37.097
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY GOT HERE
AHEAD OF YOU.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.166
- WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.435
LOOK, TEN YEARS AGO,
THE TAPE AND GLOVES ARE LISTED

11:42.469 --> 11:45.105
AS BEING CHECKED OUT
BY A DETECTIVE O'REILLY?

11:45.138 --> 11:47.507
- AS PART OF
THE ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.509
- NO. HE'S COLD CASE?
- DON'T THINK SO.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.379
THEY RE-OPENED A BUNCH
OF '80s CASES A FEW YEARS BACK.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.014
- HOLD UP.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.484
THIS EMPTY BOX IS LISTED
AS ONE OF TWO.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.052
WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.988
- JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
I WAS OUT...

12:01.021 --> 12:04.291
THEY PULL ME BACK IN.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.227
- NUMBER FIVE.
NEW YORK. KIRA.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.762
YOU RAPED AND YOU KILLED HER

12:08.796 --> 12:10.197
JUST LIKE YOU DID
THE OTHER GIRLS.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.132
- NO!
I NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.167
- NO? COME ON, MAN.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.836
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID AT FIRST
ABOUT THE OTHER FOUR GIRLS.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.805
- THIS ONE I DIDN'T DO.
SHE'S NOT EVEN MY TYPE.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.207
RED HAIR?
I DIDN'T DO HER!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.009
- BRIAN, WE CAN PROVE
THAT YOU DID NOW!

12:22.042 --> 12:24.544
WE HAVE SEMEN
FROM THE FIRST FOUR BODIES!

12:24.577 --> 12:26.513
YOUR DNA!

12:26.546 --> 12:28.348
AND KIRA,
EVEN WITHOUT THE SEMEN,

12:28.381 --> 12:30.784
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOUR DNA
INSIDE THAT LATEX GLOVE.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.419
- I MEAN,
WHATEVER YOU SAY, MAN.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.021
- NO, WE NEED TO HEAR
YOU SAY IT.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.889
- LOOK, I JUST WANNA
GET OUTTA THIS ROOM.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.090
- THAT'S NOT HAPPENING UNTIL
YOU START TELLING THE TRUTH.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.092
- THE TRUTH?

12:39.126 --> 12:41.294
I DIDN'T TOUCH THIS BITCH!

12:41.328 --> 12:43.230
I HATE REDHEADS!

12:43.263 --> 12:46.900
KEEP THIS UP--GET OFF ME--
I'M GONNA ASK FOR THAT LAWYER.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.236
- WHY IS HE STALLING
ON THE LAST VIC?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.939
- CRETIN PROBABLY KNEW
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT.

12:51.972 --> 12:55.542
OH, YEAH, KIRA STANGER WAS
TWO MONTHS ALONG WHEN SHE DIED.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.510
POLICE KEPT IT
OUT OF AUTOPSY REPORTS

12:57.544 --> 12:59.146
TO SAVE THE FAMILY.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.547
- ALL RIGHT,
SO THE FBI KNEW THAT.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.149
- MM-HMM.
- HOW DID HE KNOW?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.952
- SHE PROBABLY TOLD HIM...

13:04.985 --> 13:07.888
WHEN SHE WAS BEGGING
FOR HER LIFE.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.358
HMM.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.927
CAPTAIN,
I REALIZE THIS IS NEW YORK,

13:13.961 --> 13:18.131
BUT I KNOW HIM.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.501
THANK YOU.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.337
- MAN UP, GET IT OVER WITH.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.073
- MR. TRAYMOR.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.475
DANA LEWIS.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.011
FBI.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.412
SO YOUR CAPTAIN SAID
THAT Y'ALL CAN TAKE A BREAK.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.082
MR. TRAYMOR AND I
ARE GONNA KEEP ON TALKING.

13:38.351 --> 13:42.589
- HE'S ALL YOURS...
AGENT.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.257
[door slams]

13:44.291 --> 13:47.327
- MR. TRAYMOR, IT MAY NOT
SEEM LIKE IT RIGHT NOW,

13:47.360 --> 13:49.062
BUT I AM HERE
AS YOUR FRIEND.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.098
- I DON'T GET IT.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.567
- YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING
BACK TO PRISON...

13:54.601 --> 13:56.303
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

13:56.336 --> 14:00.007
THAT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING
IN THE WORLD.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.341
THERE ARE PLACES

14:01.374 --> 14:05.145
WHERE YOU WILL BE LUCKY
TO GET OUTTA THAT CHAIR.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.148
YOU WILL BE LUCKY
TO GET A BUCKET.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.517
BUT THERE'S OTHER PLACES...

14:10.550 --> 14:14.654
THAT ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT
MORE ENLIGHTENED.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.123
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:16.156 --> 14:18.025
- I KNOW YOU KILLED HER.
- I--

14:18.058 --> 14:20.460
- DON'T TALK, JUST LISTEN.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.562
YOU WORRIED
ABOUT HER BEING PREGNANT?

14:22.595 --> 14:24.331
NO ONE HAS TO KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.434
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH
RIGHT NOW

14:27.467 --> 14:29.269
AND EVERYTHING
IS GONNA BE OKAY.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.940
- SHE WAS PREGNANT?
- SEE? I KNEW YOU KNEW.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.107
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

14:34.141 --> 14:36.176
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

14:36.209 --> 14:41.348
BECAUSE I KNOW.
I KNOW.

14:41.381 --> 14:46.186
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH ROAD
ALL THESE YEARS,

14:46.219 --> 14:48.455
STUCK IN THAT CHAIR.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.558
PEOPLE LOOKING
RIGHT THROUGH YOU,

14:51.591 --> 14:56.663
NOBODY KNOWING
WHAT YOU ARE CAPABLE OF.

14:56.696 --> 15:00.700
BUT I SEE YOU,
AND I SAW YOU BACK THEN.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.003
- CAPTAIN,
WE WERE RIGHT THERE.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.138
- HE WAS ABOUT TO LAWYER UP.
- UNTIL WE TALKED HIM DOWN.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.240
- IT DOESN'T HURT
TO SWITCH IT UP.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.242
- LIV, YOU GOT A SECOND?
- YOU HAD TO SHOW THESE GIRLS

15:09.276 --> 15:11.378
WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE WITH A REAL MAN.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.514
THEY DIDN'T APPRECIATE YOU,
AND HERE YOU ARE.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.351
I BET...

15:18.385 --> 15:22.089
IT DID FEEL GOOD
TO TELL THE TRUTH

15:22.122 --> 15:25.525
ABOUT THOSE GIRLS,
DIDN'T IT, BRIAN?

15:26.593 --> 15:30.397
LIKE A WEIGHT...

15:30.430 --> 15:36.336
JUST...

15:36.369 --> 15:41.141
LIFTED OFF YOUR SHOULDERS.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.642
- YEAH.

15:42.675 --> 15:46.279
- IT'S LIKE A PRESSURE...

15:46.313 --> 15:49.616
PUSHING DOWN
ON YOUR HEAD...

15:49.649 --> 15:52.285
LIKE A BRICK.

15:52.319 --> 15:56.256
LET IT GO.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.226
I THINK THAT THE MAN
WHO DID ALL THAT

15:59.259 --> 16:02.462
IS NOT THE MAN
YOU ARE TODAY.

16:02.495 --> 16:07.134
UNLESS YOU OWN UP TO IT,
YOU CAN NEVER MOVE ON.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.139
I WANT YOU TO HAVE PEACE.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.507
BRIAN...

16:14.541 --> 16:17.644
DON'T YOU WANT THAT TOO?

16:17.677 --> 16:22.182
PEACE.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.251
- YES.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.123
- WELL, TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.

16:30.157 --> 16:35.028
YOU REMEMBER HER.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.797
SO...

16:37.830 --> 16:41.034
PRETTY.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.270
SO YOUNG.

16:45.205 --> 16:48.175
THOSE EYES.

16:52.212 --> 16:56.316
DO YOU REMEMBER?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.586
- I REMEMBER.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.757
- ROLLINS CHECKED IN.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.326
THE SAMPLES
FROM KIRA'S EVIDENCE BOX

17:06.359 --> 17:07.694
WERE CHECKED OUT
TEN YEARS AGO

17:07.727 --> 17:10.097
BY A DETECTIVE
UNRELATED TO THE CASE

17:10.130 --> 17:12.532
WHO CAN'T--OR WON'T--
REMEMBER WHY.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.202
- COLD CASE.
MORE LIKE...LOST CASE.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.805
- YEAH, THE DETECTIVE DID
MENTION THE FBI BEING INVOLVED.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.241
- THEY WERE.
- EXCUSE ME.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.210
I'M LOOKING
FOR DETECTIVE ROLLINS.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.211
- CAN WE HELP YOU?

17:24.244 --> 17:25.678
- UH, MS. ROLLINS,

17:25.712 --> 17:27.347
SHE SAID THERE'S
A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY

17:27.380 --> 17:29.416
IN KIRA STANGER'S MURDER.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.717
- AND YOU ARE?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.252
- NOAH BUNNING.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.521
I WAS KIRA'S FIANCE.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.190
HER PARENTS CALLED.
I JUST FLEW IN FROM SEATTLE.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.192
- THAT WAS NICE WORK.
- HE'S DONE!

17:39.226 --> 17:42.162
HE SAID HE'S GONNA SLEEP ON IT,
BUT HE'S THERE.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.463
WE GOT HIM!

17:43.496 --> 17:45.098
- DANA?

17:45.132 --> 17:49.102
- EXCUSE ME?

17:49.136 --> 17:51.404
- I-IT'S NOAH.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.140
- OH! OF COURSE.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.142
I'M SORRY,
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY DAY.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.510
- WAIT, YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

17:57.544 --> 18:00.079
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

18:01.681 --> 18:05.452
NOAH, I-I THINK
WE FINALLY GOT HIM.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.794
- TRAYMOR CONFESSED
TO KIRA TOO?

18:14.827 --> 18:16.163
- UH, YEAH.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.430
WELL, YOU TOOK HIM
TO THE EDGE.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.332
I JUST FLICKED HIM OVER.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.800
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
- I KNOW!

18:20.833 --> 18:22.502
IT'S BEEN A SHOCK.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.804
I GOTTA CALL MY TEAM,
AND THEN I'LL FILL YOU IN.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.540
- NICK CAN DO THAT.
- OF COURSE.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.309
SO WE'LL CATCH UP LATER.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.278
- MR. BUNNING,
GRAB YOUR BAG.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.546
RIGHT THIS WAY.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.551
- SO WE GOT HIM ON ALL FIVE?
- [exhales]

18:38.585 --> 18:40.553
- HAVE A SEAT.
- I'LL CALL THE D.A.,

18:40.587 --> 18:42.522
SEE WHERE WE ARE
WITH CHARGING HIM.

18:42.555 --> 18:46.226
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU TWO HAD MET.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.894
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T TALK
TO THE FAMILY.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.696
- OH, THE PARENTS,

18:49.729 --> 18:52.599
BUT NOAH AND I,
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE...

18:52.632 --> 18:54.534
COLLEGE.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.269
- YOU NEVER MENTIONED THAT.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.205
- IT WAS 25 YEARS AGO.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.739
- I WAS A SENIOR
AND HE WAS A FRESHMAN

18:59.772 --> 19:01.441
AT, UH, TULANE,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.410
AND I THINK HE HAD
A LITTLE CRUSH ON ME.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.878
BUT THAT BOY
HAS HAD HIS LIFE

19:05.912 --> 19:08.315
PULLED OUT FROM UNDER HIM.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.524
- I GOTTA TELL YOU,

19:17.557 --> 19:21.328
NONE OF THESE GUYS
MEANS ANYTHING.

19:22.729 --> 19:27.900
- UH, YOU AND KIRA
EVER WATCH BASKETBALL?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.769
- KIRA?
[laughs]

19:29.802 --> 19:31.704
SHE WAS FROM VERMONT.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.373
OTHER THAN
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING,

19:33.406 --> 19:35.375
SHE THOUGHT SPORTS
WERE RIDICULOUS.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.909
- MM-HMM.

19:36.943 --> 19:40.247
AND WHERE WERE YOU
THAT NIGHT?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.315
- AT DUKE.

19:42.349 --> 19:46.586
I WAS A TEXTBOOK SALESMEN.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.356
IF I'D BEEN HOME...

19:49.389 --> 19:51.758
- I'M SORRY.
- IT'S SO SURREAL.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.393
IT'S NOT LIKE I THINK ABOUT IT
EVERY DAY ANYMORE.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.994
I GOT MARRIED.
I HAD A KID.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.763
I GOT DIVORCED.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.598
BUT I'LL TELL YOU,

19:58.631 --> 20:02.935
NOT A MONTH GOES BY SOMETHING
DOESN'T REMIND ME OF KIRA.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.437
I'M SORRY,
I GUESS THIS IS BRINGING BACK,

20:04.471 --> 20:07.006
YOU KNOW--

20:07.039 --> 20:10.009
UH, KIRA'S PARENTS
NEVER BOUGHT WHAT THE COPS...

20:10.042 --> 20:13.980
TOLD THEM, BY THE WAY,
ABOUT HER BRINGING A GUY HOME.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.015
SHE WAS SHY.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.619
HE MUST'VE DRUGGED HER
OR BROKEN IN SOMEHOW.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.756
DANA SAID THAT
WAS MAYBE A POSSIBILITY.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.293
- WHAT, AGENT LEWIS?
- I CALLED HER WHEN IT HAPPENED.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.461
NYPD HAD
ALREADY BROUGHT HER IN.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.698
- WAIT, SO YOU TWO
STAYED IN TOUCH AFTER COLLEGE?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.800
- A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.
WE--WE--

20:33.833 --> 20:36.769
WE DATED ON AND OFF.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.273
- OH.

20:40.307 --> 20:44.844
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE, UH--

20:44.877 --> 20:47.714
DID SHE TALK TO YOU
ABOUT HER CASES?

20:47.747 --> 20:51.351
- WE DIDN'T, UH,
TALK A LOT...

20:51.384 --> 20:53.453
IF YOU...
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.456
- NO, BUT LET ME ASK YOU.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.626
KIRA GETTING PREGNANT--
THAT WAS PLANNED?

20:59.659 --> 21:02.329
- NO.
[chuckles]

21:02.362 --> 21:05.665
IN FACT, I...
FREAKED OUT AT FIRST.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.302
BUT THEN I REALIZED
IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.939
- SO YOU STOPPED
SEEING DANA?

21:12.972 --> 21:15.408
- I GUESS I MUST'VE.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.344
UM...

21:17.377 --> 21:18.745
I MEAN, DANA, YOU KNOW,

21:18.778 --> 21:22.915
I ALWAYS KNEW SHE WASN'T...
THE ONE.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.726
- CAPTAIN...

21:33.760 --> 21:35.528
UM...

21:35.562 --> 21:40.533
KIRA'S MURDER--LIKE,
DID YOU HEAR BRIAN CONFESS?

21:40.567 --> 21:42.034
- WELL, I MISSED
THE END GAME,

21:42.068 --> 21:45.338
BUT HE ADMITTED KNOWING HER,
PUT HIMSELF IN THE ROOM.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.639
- BUT DID HE SAY
WHERE HE MET HER?

21:46.673 --> 21:49.376
- NICK, THE PATTERN
IS PRETTY CLEAR.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.643
- THIS ONE'S
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.645
SHE WASN'T A SPORTS FAN,
THERE'S NO DNA.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.081
- NICK, WE'RE GOOD.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.549
DANA JUST GAVE ME
THE BLOW BY BLOW.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.651
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU

21:58.685 --> 22:00.119
THAT SHE AND NOAH
DATED OFF AND ON,

22:00.152 --> 22:01.621
EVEN AFTER KIRA?

22:01.654 --> 22:05.492
- WELL,
SHE'S A PRIVATE PERSON.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.426
WHAT?

22:06.459 --> 22:08.361
- LOOK, LEWIS AND NOAH
WERE OLD FRIENDS.

22:08.395 --> 22:11.030
SHE'S FBI,
KNEW THE KILLER'S PROFILE.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.099
SHE MIGHT'VE TALKED ABOUT IT
WITH NOAH.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.734
- HE HAD AN ALIBI.
WHAT--

22:14.767 --> 22:16.636
HE WAS A SUSPECT INITIALLY.
THEY RULED HIM OUT.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.372
- YEAH, WELL,
CAN'T HURT TO DOUBLE CHECK.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.541
- OKAY, I'LL HAVE FIN
AND ROLLINS SEE

22:21.574 --> 22:25.545
IF THEY CAN TRACK DOWN
THE ORIGINAL DETECTIVE.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.113
- THERE'S ONE MORE QUESTION.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.982
WHEN LEWIS BROKE IN
ON LIV AND ME WITH BRIAN,

22:30.016 --> 22:31.418
WAS THAT YOUR IDEA?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.085
- NO, SHE ASKED,
SAID SHE KNEW THIS GUY.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.822
- SHE DID.
SHE KNEW HIS PATTERNS.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.424
- WELL, SHE WAS OBSESSED
WITH BRIAN.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.125
IF NOAH KNEW THAT--
- YOU THINK THAT HE PLAYED HER

22:39.158 --> 22:40.960
AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT IT.

22:40.993 --> 22:44.631
NOT A CHANCE.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.638
- YOU KNOW, MOST MURDERS,
BAD KILLS BAD.

22:51.671 --> 22:55.007
KIRA,
SHE WAS A GENUINE VICTIM.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.143
NOT A DROP OF LIQUOR
IN THE HOUSE.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.578
A TEACHER.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.413
- ANY OTHER SUSPECTS?

23:00.447 --> 23:02.081
- WE HAD TO LOOK
AT THE FIANCE, NATURALLY,

23:02.114 --> 23:05.084
BUT HE HAD AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI.
- HOW AIRTIGHT?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.987
- RECEIPTS,
PHONE RECORDS, PLANE TICKETS.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.890
BESIDES,
AFTER INTERVIEWING HIM,

23:10.923 --> 23:12.925
THERE WAS NO WAY.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.661
HIS HEART WAS BROKEN.

23:14.694 --> 23:17.163
- WELL, WE HEARD THE FBI
WAS IN ON THIS.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.199
- OH, YEAH.
THEY HAD THIS GIRL PROFILER.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.734
SHE ACTED LIKE
IT WAS HER CRIME SCENE

23:21.768 --> 23:23.736
AND WE WERE
JUST THE HIRED HELP.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.805
- DID SHE EVER MENTION
THAT SHE KNEW THE FIANCE?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.774
- NO! THAT ONE?
[scoffs]

23:27.807 --> 23:30.109
SHE WAS ALL BUSINESS.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.144
- 20 HOURS
IN THIS CHAIR.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.614
[grunting]

23:34.647 --> 23:37.784
THAT WASN'T RIGHT.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.553
- WELL...
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR REST NOW.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.688
- I'M NOT TIRED.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.123
- YOU GOT SOMETHING
ON YOUR MIND?

23:44.156 --> 23:48.160
- DOESN'T MATTER.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.837
- I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A WHILE,

23:57.870 --> 24:00.239
AND USUALLY,
WHEN YOU FINALLY CONFESS...

24:00.272 --> 24:02.509
IT'S EASY TO FALL ASLEEP.

24:05.645 --> 24:08.147
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.182
THAT LAST GIRL,

24:10.216 --> 24:13.886
THE ONE THE FBI LADY
TALKED ABOUT--

24:13.920 --> 24:15.187
SHE REALLY PREGNANT?

24:15.221 --> 24:16.656
- YEAH.

24:16.689 --> 24:21.093
- THAT'S TOUGH.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.130
WHY WAS SHE DRINKING
IN THE BAR?

24:29.135 --> 24:31.971
- IS THAT WHERE YOU MET HER?

24:32.004 --> 24:34.874
- I GUESS, BUT...

24:34.907 --> 24:36.643
YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO TOLD ME THAT.

24:36.676 --> 24:41.113
- SO WHAT DO YOU
REMEMBER ABOUT HER?

24:41.147 --> 24:44.517
- LOOK,
I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.820
YOU SEEN ME
IN THIS WHEELCHAIR.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.189
THE ONLY SEX LIFE I'VE HAD
IN THE LAST 25 YEARS, MAN,

24:50.222 --> 24:53.526
IS RIGHT HERE.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.828
THOSE OTHER FOUR GIRLS?

24:55.862 --> 24:59.131
I REMEMBER THEM.
EVERY DETAIL.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.133
I REPLAY IT.

25:01.167 --> 25:06.005
YOU GET TIRED OF ONE TAPE,
GO TO THE NEXT.

25:07.073 --> 25:10.209
THIS LAST GIRL--

25:10.242 --> 25:13.212
IT'S LIKE THE TAPE
GOT ERASED.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.584
- SO NOAH,

25:17.617 --> 25:19.285
HE'S WHY YOU STAYED ON THIS.

25:19.318 --> 25:22.054
- YEAH, PARTLY.

25:22.088 --> 25:25.024
- SO HE CALLED YOU
AFTER KIRA WAS KILLED?

25:25.057 --> 25:28.060
- YEAH, AND THEN--AFTER WHICH
I HAD TO RECUSE MYSELF.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.230
THE BUREAU,
THEY'RE REAL STICKLERS ON THAT.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.065
- AND DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN THE LAST TIME

25:33.099 --> 25:37.770
YOU TALKED TO HIM WAS
BEFORE KIRA WAS KILLED?

25:37.804 --> 25:41.741
- HONESTLY, I DON'T.
[phone ringing]

25:41.774 --> 25:43.576
- BENSON.
- [whistles]

25:43.610 --> 25:46.112
- YEAH.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.850
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

25:50.883 --> 25:54.020
OKAY, YEAH.
ON MY WAY.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.223
BAD NEWS.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.025
BRIAN'S RECANTING.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.660
- ON ALL OF THEM?

26:00.693 --> 26:02.995
- NO,
JUST ON THE LAST ONE.

26:03.029 --> 26:06.733
HE'S CLAIMING COERCION.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.842
- LIV, LISTEN TO ME.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.210
LOOK, ALL I KNOW
IS BRIAN'S NOT GOOD FOR THIS.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.279
- NICK.
- LOOK, NOAH HAS AN ALIBI,

26:20.312 --> 26:22.214
BUT HE MIGHT'VE HAD HELP.

26:22.248 --> 26:26.218
- NICK, LISTEN TO ME.
DANA IS NOT INVOLVED.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.354
SHE'S AS DEDICATED
A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

26:28.387 --> 26:31.157
AS I AM.
- HEY!

26:31.190 --> 26:33.159
WHAT IS TAKING BRIAN
SO LONG?

26:33.192 --> 26:36.295
- HE WAS IN THE BATHROOM.
JUST LET ME CHECK.

26:36.328 --> 26:39.265
- OKAY.
SO LET'S CLOSE THIS OUT.

26:49.141 --> 26:52.945
- BRIAN HAD AN ACCIDENT.
THEY'RE CHANGING HIS CLOTHES.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.114
- HE'S JUST TRYING
TO DRAW THIS THING OUT,

26:55.147 --> 26:58.050
AND IF Y'ALL HAD BEEN
VIDEOTAPING MY INTERVIEW,

26:58.084 --> 26:59.986
HE'D BE IN ARRAIGNMENT
RIGHT NOW!

27:00.019 --> 27:03.322
- WE'LL GET YOU A CAMERA,
AGENT LEWIS.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.895
- BRIAN'S IN THE CRASH ROOM.
UNI KNOWS NOT TO LET ANYONE IN.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.230
- GOOD.

27:11.263 --> 27:14.934
LEWIS ASKED FOR VIDEO.

27:14.967 --> 27:18.270
- NOW HE SAYS
HE'S GOT DIGESTIVE DISTRESS.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.406
UNI'S CLEANING HIM UP.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.974
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN TAKING CARE OF HIM,

27:22.008 --> 27:24.777
SO, UH, WHERE'S HE AT?

27:24.811 --> 27:27.413
- HE'S OUT OF DENIAL,
STARTING TO SHOW REMORSE,

27:27.446 --> 27:30.349
WORRIED ABOUT THE FAMILIES--
EVERYONE'S EXCEPT KIRA'S.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.318
- WELL, I THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.321
THERE WAS NO SEMEN...
FOUND AT THE SCENE.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.790
SO HE FAILED TO PERFORM,

27:37.824 --> 27:40.226
AND HE--HE DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.928
- MAYBE.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.864
HE WAS ALSO UPSET
ABOUT KIRA'S PREGNANCY

27:44.897 --> 27:48.000
AND THAT SHE WAS AT A BAR.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.936
VIDEO'S UP.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.338
LET ME CHECK ON BRIAN.

27:52.371 --> 27:56.375
- KIRA'S PARENTS
SAID THE SAME THING.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.845
THEY SAID
THAT THERE'S NO WAY

27:58.878 --> 28:01.848
THAT KIRA WOULD TAKE
A STRANGER HOME.

28:01.881 --> 28:05.284
DID KIRA GO TO SCHOOL
WITH YOU AND NOAH?

28:05.317 --> 28:06.953
- UH, NO.
HE WAS YOUNGER THAN ME.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.822
AND SHE WAS YOUNGER
THAN HIM.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.825
- BUT YOU WERE STILL IN CONTACT
WITH NOAH WHEN HE MET KIRA?

28:12.859 --> 28:15.461
- [exhales]
GOSH, I DON'T--I DON'T REMEMBER.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.730
UH, IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

28:17.764 --> 28:21.200
- DID YOU EVER MEET KIRA?

28:21.233 --> 28:23.035
- HONEY, I CAN'T REMEMBER.

28:23.069 --> 28:27.406
I MIGHT HAVE MET HER
AT A PARTY.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.375
- SHE'S TRYING TO SUSS OUT
WHERE WE ARE.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.143
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHEN THAT WAS?

28:31.177 --> 28:32.779
- WE'RE STREAMING LIVE.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.014
HOW WAS STATEN ISLAND?
- PARADISE.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.984
BUT THE ORIGINAL DETECTIVE'S
SURE NOAH'S NOT GOOD FOR THIS.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.286
- BUT HERE'S
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.

28:40.319 --> 28:43.255
THAT DETECTIVE SAID AGENT LEWIS
WAS ALL OVER THAT CRIME SCENE.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.523
- EVEN THOUGH SHE TOLD LIV

28:44.556 --> 28:48.127
SHE WAS DOWN IN GEORGIA
AT THE TIME.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.495
- IS MUNCH
STILL AT COLD CASE?

28:49.528 --> 28:51.964
- DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH
ON FINDING THAT SECOND BOX.

28:51.998 --> 28:55.334
- SHOULD WE GIVE THE FBI
AN...UPDATE?

28:55.367 --> 28:58.971
- LET'S GIVE LIV ONE FIRST.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.073
[knocks at door]

29:01.107 --> 29:02.374
FIN AND ROLLINS ARE BACK

29:02.408 --> 29:05.177
FROM TALKING
TO THE ORIGINAL DETECTIVE.

29:05.211 --> 29:09.315
OH, AND HE SENDS HIS BEST,
AGENT LEWIS.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.418
- OH!

29:12.451 --> 29:15.187
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD TO RECUSE YOURSELF.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.789
- WELL...
[scoffs]

29:16.823 --> 29:18.124
[stammers]
I MEAN, I KEPT MY EYE ON IT.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.325
[laughs]

29:19.358 --> 29:21.127
AND WHY ARE YOU TALKING
TO THIS DETECTIVE?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.962
HE'S PROBABLY SENILE BY NOW.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.965
IF YOU HAVE ANY LOOSE THREADS,
ASK ME.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.267
- WELL, WE JUST WANTED
TO DOUBLE CHECK NOAH'S ALIBI.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.269
- WELL,
HE'S NOT GOOD FOR IT!

29:30.302 --> 29:32.071
WHERE'S BRIAN?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.505
- I AM AS FRUSTRATED
AS YOU ARE,

29:33.539 --> 29:37.243
AND I WILL BRING HIM
DOWN HERE MYSELF IF I HAVE TO.

29:43.515 --> 29:48.187
- YOU WERE ALL
LOOKING INTO NOAH

29:48.220 --> 29:50.022
AND YOU DIDN'T FILL ME IN?

29:50.056 --> 29:52.024
- WE THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT HAVE A BLIND SPOT.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.193
- WHY? BECAUSE I DATED HIM
IN COLLEGE?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.594
- NOAH SAYS THAT
IT WAS MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.264
- OH, WELL, HE DID?
[chuckles]

29:58.297 --> 29:59.565
WASN'T TO ME.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.433
I DIDN'T TAKE IT
ALL THAT SERIOUSLY.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.402
- EVEN THOUGH HE ENDED IT
WITH YOU RIGHT AFTER HE MET HER?

30:03.435 --> 30:06.238
- I WAS IN QUANTICO.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.340
I WAS CONSUMED
WITH MY CAREER.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.543
I WASN'T OBSESSED
WITH SOME OLD BOYFRIEND.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.445
- BOYFRIEND?

30:13.479 --> 30:16.182
SO YOU DID CALL HIM
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.451
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.387
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

30:21.420 --> 30:23.489
I WOULD SAY THAT
THIS WAS AN INTERROGATION.

30:23.522 --> 30:26.893
- SHALL I MIRANDIZE YOU?

30:33.599 --> 30:36.602
- YOU GOT SOMETHING
TO ASK...

30:36.635 --> 30:39.105
ASK ME.

30:39.138 --> 30:43.042
- TALK TO ME, DANA.

30:44.610 --> 30:48.981
[whispering]
HOW DID WE END UP HERE?

30:54.386 --> 30:58.024
- "HOW DID WE END UP HERE?"

30:58.057 --> 31:00.326
REALLY, OLIVIA?

31:00.359 --> 31:03.062
AND WHERE IS IT
THAT YOU THINK WE ARE?

31:03.095 --> 31:05.297
- BRIAN'S NOT GOOD FOR THIS,

31:05.331 --> 31:07.566
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.669
YOUR BUDDY NOAH
HAS AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.305
IF YOU WERE ME,

31:13.339 --> 31:17.243
TALKING TO SOMEBODY
WHO PROFILED THE KILLER,

31:17.276 --> 31:19.912
WHO HID HER PERSONAL TIES
WITH THE DECEASED--

31:19.946 --> 31:22.514
- I'D ASK ME
WHERE I WAS THAT NIGHT.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.550
SNELLVILLE, GEORGIA.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.318
AND NO, I CAN'T PROVE IT.
I WAS UNDERCOVER.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.587
- [chuckles]

31:28.620 --> 31:31.223
- HONEY...

31:31.257 --> 31:33.359
I'M NOT GOOD FOR THIS.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.662
YOU RUN TOUCH DNA
ON THOSE GLOVES, YOU'LL SEE.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.231
- CAPTAIN, I'M TRYING!

31:39.265 --> 31:41.100
IT'S NOT LIKE A NEEDLE
IN A HAYSTACK,

31:41.133 --> 31:44.636
IT'S MORE LIKE...
A PIECE OF HAY IN A HAYSTACK.

31:44.670 --> 31:48.240
- FIN, GO TO COLD CASE
AND HELP MUNCH.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.109
AND TAKE
YOUR READING GLASSES.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.211
- WHILE WE'RE WAITING,

31:52.244 --> 31:56.182
I MEAN, SHE JUST BROUGHT UP
THE LATEX GLOVES.

31:56.215 --> 31:59.685
MAYBE WE FOLLOW THROUGH?

32:02.288 --> 32:04.390
HEY.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.661
- [laughing]
OH, COME ON!

32:09.695 --> 32:11.330
WHAT IS THIS, A WHISPER
ABOUT A BREAK IN THE CASE?

32:11.363 --> 32:13.232
Y'ALL ARE ON FIRE NOW.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.668
- OKAY, AGENT LEWIS.

32:16.702 --> 32:19.471
YOU WANT US TO PLAY IT STRAIGHT,
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM HERE.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.173
- WELL, ENLIGHTEN ME.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.641
- THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE
THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT,

32:22.674 --> 32:25.177
IT'S GONE, BUT...
YOU KNEW THAT, DIDN'T YOU?

32:25.211 --> 32:27.179
- [laughs]
IS EVERYBODY HERE PARANOID?

32:27.213 --> 32:29.448
- WE CAUGHT A BREAK THOUGH.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.317
THE DETECTIVE
THAT CHECKED OUT THE EVIDENCE

32:31.350 --> 32:35.721
DIDN'T REALIZE HE WAS
CHECKING OUT BOX ONE OF TWO.

32:35.754 --> 32:39.158
- YOU FOUND IT!
GOOD!

32:39.191 --> 32:41.360
DID YOU CHECK THE GLOVES
THAT HE STUFFED IN HER MOUTH?

32:41.393 --> 32:43.029
- OH, NO, THOSE WEREN'T
IN THE BOX, BUT...

32:43.062 --> 32:44.430
- MM.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.299
- WE RECOVERED
KIRA'S FINGERNAIL CLIPPINGS.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.201
THERE WAS BLOOD ON 'EM.

32:49.235 --> 32:51.270
- WE'RE GONNA
RUN THE DNA, DANA.

32:51.303 --> 32:55.274
- YOU ARE?
WELL, MY DNA MAY BE THERE,

32:55.307 --> 32:56.742
BECAUSE I WAS
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

32:56.775 --> 32:58.277
AND I WAS AT THE MORGUE.

32:58.310 --> 33:02.114
AND CROSS-CONTAMINATION
IS THE BANE OF FORENSICS

33:02.148 --> 33:04.216
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.686
YOU KNOW, ALL THESE BLUFFS--
I WROTE THE BOOK ON 'EM.

33:07.719 --> 33:12.558
THE PROBLEM IS THEY DON'T WORK
ON SOMEONE WHO ISN'T GUILTY.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.794
- I, UH--

33:15.827 --> 33:18.664
I GUESS I'M NOT SURE
WHY I'M HERE AGAIN.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.332
YOU--YOU'VE GOT
HIS CONFESSION, RIGHT?

33:20.366 --> 33:22.701
- THERE ARE
SOME INCONSISTENCIES--

33:22.734 --> 33:25.404
THINGS DANA TOLD US,
TOLD YOU.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.639
- YOU WANNA TALK TO ME
ABOUT DANA?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.375
- WELL, MORE ABOUT THE DANA
YOU KNEW BACK THEN.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.310
NOW, YOU TOLD ME
SHE WASN'T THE ONE.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.711
DID DANA KNOW THAT?

33:32.744 --> 33:34.580
- I-I DON'T KNOW.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.415
I--YES!
YES, SHE MUST HAVE.

33:36.448 --> 33:39.151
- ALL RIGHT,
SO YOU BROKE UP WITH HER?

33:39.185 --> 33:40.786
- WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY
A BREAKUP.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.089
I WAS TRAVELING A LOT.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.691
- AH, SO YOU DID
THE FADE AWAY?

33:45.724 --> 33:47.326
- I GUESS.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.261
- AND SHE DID
HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU?

33:49.295 --> 33:51.097
DID SHE EVER TALK ABOUT
WANTING MORE?

33:51.130 --> 33:53.332
GETTING MARRIED,
STARTING A FAMILY?

33:53.365 --> 33:56.135
- YEAH.
I TOLD HER I WASN'T READY.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.603
- SO HOW LONG AFTER THAT

33:57.636 --> 34:00.272
DID YOU TELL HER
YOU WERE GONNA MARRY KIRA?

34:00.306 --> 34:03.342
- A FEW MONTHS.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.843
AND WHEN I TOLD HER,
SHE LOST IT.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.814
SH--SHE WOULDN'T STOP SHAKING.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.320
YOU'RE SAYING
THIS WASN'T A STRANGER...

34:14.353 --> 34:17.689
THAT KIRA--

34:17.723 --> 34:20.859
- NOAH, HELP ME HERE.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.395
OKAY?
- [stammers]

34:23.429 --> 34:25.564
- JUST HAVE A SEAT.

34:25.597 --> 34:31.403
THIS...WAS MORE
THAN JUST A BREAKUP...

34:31.437 --> 34:33.439
WASN'T IT?

34:33.472 --> 34:35.441
- WHATEVER HAPPENED,

34:35.474 --> 34:39.445
I'M SURE THAT
THERE WAS A GOOD REASON.

34:39.478 --> 34:43.315
- LISTEN TO YOU.
RATIONALIZE, PROJECT, MINIMIZE.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.717
YOU'VE USED EVERY TOOL.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.253
IF I DID HAVE
SOMETHING TO CONFESS,

34:47.286 --> 34:48.687
I'D GIVE IT TO YOU

34:48.720 --> 34:50.322
JUST TO MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF.

34:53.892 --> 34:55.461
- [mocking laugh]

34:55.494 --> 34:57.896
THE CAVALRY.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.399
DID YOU COME IN
TO RESCUE YOUR PARTNER,

35:00.432 --> 35:01.833
TELL HER SHE'S LOST?

35:01.867 --> 35:05.337
- SHE'S RIGHT, LIV.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.274
WE ARE NOT THERE YET...

35:08.307 --> 35:10.376
NOT WITHOUT MOTIVE.

35:10.409 --> 35:13.279
- OH, AND I'M GUESSING
YOU HAVE A THEORY ABOUT THAT.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.148
- WELL,
I DO KNOW YOU WERE UPSET

35:16.182 --> 35:17.916
WHEN NOAH TOLD YOU
HE WAS ENGAGED TO KIRA.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.851
YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT?

35:19.885 --> 35:22.654
THE MOTEL ROOM,
AFTER YOU LET HIM SCREW YOU.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.357
- [laughing]
OUCH! OUCH!

35:25.391 --> 35:28.460
LOOK AT SUNSHINE,
PLAYING HARDBALL.

35:28.494 --> 35:33.165
YOU THINK I'M JEALOUS
OF SOME KINDERGARTEN TEACHER?

35:33.199 --> 35:35.367
SOME SMALL LIFE
IN A SMALL WORLD.

35:35.401 --> 35:38.304
YOU THINK THAT I WOULD
SACRIFICE MY CAREER AND MY LIFE

35:38.337 --> 35:40.306
FOR THAT--THAT SPECK?

35:40.339 --> 35:42.374
- "SPECK."

35:42.408 --> 35:45.377
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE STILL TALKS
ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS,

35:45.411 --> 35:47.679
HOW YOUNG.

35:47.713 --> 35:50.882
WHEN SHE MET NOAH,
SHE STOLE YOUR FUTURE.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.418
- MY FUTURE
WAS WITH THE BUREAU.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.652
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU TOLD NOAH

35:53.685 --> 35:56.388
WHEN HE GOT YOU PREGNANT.

35:58.924 --> 36:02.894
- THAT WAS PRIVATE.
HE HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL YOU.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.896
- AND YOU WANTED
TO START A FAMILY.

36:04.930 --> 36:08.234
NOAH SAID
HE WASN'T READY, SO...

36:08.267 --> 36:10.869
YOU HAD AN ABORTION.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.539
- OH, I DID?

36:13.572 --> 36:17.309
IT WAS MY IDEA?
[laughing]

36:17.343 --> 36:19.445
- NOAH ASKED YOU TO.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.780
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

36:21.813 --> 36:26.518
- DANA, EVEN THEN,
THAT MUST'VE GONE AGAINST...

36:26.552 --> 36:31.223
EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVED IN.

36:31.257 --> 36:33.425
- YOU KNOW ME,
I GET OVER THINGS.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.261
I'VE BEEN RAPED.
I'VE BEEN SHOT.

36:35.294 --> 36:39.331
- STILL, YOU'D BEEN SEEING HIM
FOR WHAT, SIX, SEVEN YEARS?

36:39.365 --> 36:41.400
YOU LOVED HIM.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.502
- NOT AFTER HE LIED TO ME.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.871
- WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

36:45.904 --> 36:49.975
THAT IF YOU GOT AN ABORTION
THAT YOU TWO COULD BE TOGETHER?

36:50.008 --> 36:51.977
- [laughing]

36:52.010 --> 36:54.380
AND I'M AN FBI PROFILER.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.348
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK PEOPLE IN THE FACE

36:56.382 --> 36:58.350
AND TELL YOU
WHEN THEY'RE LYING.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.786
- HOW LONG AFTER THAT DID HE
TELL YOU HE WAS MARRYING KIRA?

37:00.819 --> 37:06.392
- UM, I DON'T REMEMBER.
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.995
- TWO MONTHS,
IF THAT.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.799
- TWO MONTHS?

37:13.832 --> 37:16.034
[scoffs]
NO WONDER YOU BLOCKED IT OUT.

37:16.067 --> 37:20.339
THE HURT, THE BETRAYAL.

37:20.372 --> 37:23.342
HE ASKS YOU
TO GET AN ABORTION,

37:23.375 --> 37:25.477
AND THEN HE LEAVES YOU
FOR HER.

37:25.511 --> 37:26.945
- I WAS BETTER OFF.

37:26.978 --> 37:29.315
HE FALLS FOR ONE
OF THOSE WOUNDED BIRDS

37:29.348 --> 37:31.383
WHO TRAPS MEN
IN THEIR CAGES.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.884
HE CAN ASK ME
TO GET AN ABORTION,

37:32.918 --> 37:38.023
BUT SHE WAS GONNA FALL APART
IF HE ASKS HER.

37:38.056 --> 37:41.460
- DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU
FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT?

37:41.493 --> 37:43.729
- MM.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.297
NOAH MUST'VE TOLD ME.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.932
- NO, HE DIDN'T.
I ASKED.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.734
- THEN IT MUST'VE BEEN
ONE OF THE DETECTIVES.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.470
- OR KIRA.

37:51.503 --> 37:54.406
WHAT WAS IT
THAT YOU TOLD THE CAPTAIN...

37:54.440 --> 37:55.941
ABOUT BRIAN?

37:55.974 --> 37:58.076
HOW HE FOUND OUT
THAT KIRA WAS PREGNANT

37:58.109 --> 38:00.812
WHEN SHE WAS BEGGING
FOR HER LIFE?

38:00.846 --> 38:03.682
- MM-MM.
- IS THAT HOW YOU FOUND OUT?

38:03.715 --> 38:06.385
A WEEK AFTER NOAH LEFT YOU
IN THAT MOTEL,

38:06.418 --> 38:08.053
KIRA WAS MURDERED.

38:08.086 --> 38:11.357
- WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL HIM
THAT I COULD NEVER

38:11.390 --> 38:13.058
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

38:13.091 --> 38:14.793
I AM JUST LIKE YOU.

38:14.826 --> 38:18.397
I HAVE DEDICATED
MY ENTIRE LIFE

38:18.430 --> 38:20.832
TO JUSTICE AND TO DOING GOOD
IN THE WORLD.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.101
YOU KNOW ME!

38:23.134 --> 38:25.971
- I DO.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.039
SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST,
NICK.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.842
- THANK YOU.

38:30.876 --> 38:34.346
- BUT I CAN'T HELP
FROM WONDERING

38:34.380 --> 38:36.548
IF ALL THAT SACRIFICE,

38:36.582 --> 38:40.552
EVERYTHING
THAT YOU HAVE DONE,

38:40.586 --> 38:42.020
HAS BEEN TO MAKE AMENDS,
DANA,

38:42.053 --> 38:44.623
TO MAKE UP
FOR THAT ONE MISTAKE.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.393
- NO.
DON'T SAY THAT, OLIVIA.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.660
DON'T SAY THAT.

38:48.694 --> 38:52.798
- NO WONDER YOU SPENT
SO MUCH TIME UNDERCOVER,

38:52.831 --> 38:57.636
BECAUSE YOU WERE RUNNING AWAY
FROM YOURSELF, DANA,

38:57.669 --> 39:01.106
FROM WHAT YOU HAD DONE.

39:01.139 --> 39:04.476
IT MUST'VE BEEN SO HARD

39:04.510 --> 39:09.915
TO KEEP THAT HORRIBLE SECRET
LOCKED UP INSIDE OF YOU.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.119
[whispering]
IT'S TIME NOW.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.988
YOU GOTTA LET IT GO.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.158
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I DO KNOW YOU.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.094
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU DIDN'T GO OVER THERE

39:23.128 --> 39:26.398
PLANNING TO DO THIS.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.567
JUST LET THAT GO.

39:34.139 --> 39:37.108
- I WE--

39:37.142 --> 39:39.077
I WENT OVER.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.414
I JUST WANTED--

39:42.448 --> 39:45.150
I JUST WANTED TO TELL HER

39:45.183 --> 39:47.686
THAT HE WASN'T
ANY MORE IN LOVE WITH HER

39:47.719 --> 39:49.988
THAN HE WAS WITH ME,

39:50.021 --> 39:53.425
THAT HE WAS
USING BOTH OF US.

39:54.560 --> 40:00.031
SHE SAID SH--
SHE FELT SORRY FOR ME,

40:00.065 --> 40:04.636
BUT THAT THEY
WERE MEANT TO BE,

40:04.670 --> 40:10.175
AND THAT WHEN SHE TOLD HIM
THAT SHE WAS PREGNANT,

40:10.208 --> 40:13.445
THAT HE GOT DOWN
ON HIS KNEES

40:13.479 --> 40:17.182
AND ASKED HER
TO MARRY HIM,

40:17.215 --> 40:21.453
AND THAT HE
LOOKED SO HAPPY!

40:24.089 --> 40:27.693
- THAT'S HOW YOU FOUND OUT.

40:27.726 --> 40:30.562
- AND I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.964
I MEAN, I CAME TO...
[stammering]

40:32.998 --> 40:34.533
I LOOKED DOWN,

40:34.566 --> 40:37.035
THERE WAS A BODY
LYING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,

40:37.068 --> 40:39.638
AND SHE LOOKED SO PRETTY.

40:39.671 --> 40:42.708
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,
GOD, UNTIL THAT ONE MOMENT,

40:42.741 --> 40:44.242
I BET THAT LITTLE GIRL
NEVER HAD ANYTHING GO WRONG

40:44.275 --> 40:47.813
IN HER WHOLE LIFE.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.216
- BUT SHE WAS GONE,

40:51.249 --> 40:53.752
AND THE ONLY LIFE
WORTH SAVING WAS YOUR OWN,

40:53.785 --> 40:57.923
SO YOU STAGED
THE CRIME SCENE.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.258
- I GUESS I DID.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.260
[sniffles]
I DON'T REMEMBER.

41:02.293 --> 41:06.231
I WAS JUST SO FAMILIAR
WITH ALL BRIAN'S PATTERNS.

41:06.264 --> 41:10.902
I GUESS I WAS
JUST ON AUTOPILOT.

41:10.936 --> 41:14.039
I'M SORRY.

41:14.072 --> 41:17.275
OLIVIA, I'M SORRY.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.979
- I KNOW.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.281
[door opens]

41:23.314 --> 41:25.216
- DANA LEWIS,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

41:25.250 --> 41:29.254
FOR THE MURDER
OF KIRA STANGER.

41:31.089 --> 41:34.192
- OKAY.

41:35.293 --> 41:38.964
I UNDERSTAND.
