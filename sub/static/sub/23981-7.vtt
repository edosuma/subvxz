WEBVTT

00:29.237 --> 00:32.866
Hey, just FYI, we don't
have to stay here super long.

00:32.949 --> 00:36.369
Well, let's stay at least
until the toasts.

00:36.453 --> 00:40.206
That's true. That's true.
You gotta see them toasts, baby.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.833
It's when all the good shit
goes down.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.918
You hear embarrassing stories
about people's childhoods.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.463
Oh, yeah.
-Nicknames they don't want anyone to know.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.840
Oh, we're gonna find out
so many nicknames.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.303
But, no, seriously, anytime you want
to take off, just let me know.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.014
Are you kidding me?
I love weddings.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.140
'Cause people get drunk

00:57.223 --> 01:00.143
and they get into fights and they hook up
and they dance, it's amazing.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.729
-Yeah. Table eight.
-All right.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.981
-You know it's gonna be good.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.775
What about you, you like weddings?

01:06.858 --> 01:10.904
Uh, yeah. I'm a sucker for any kind of
public display of affection.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.490
-So, weddings are my Disneyland. Yeah.
-Totally.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.118
All right. Who do you know?
You recognize anybody?

01:17.202 --> 01:18.411
Hmm, who do I know?

01:18.995 --> 01:21.289
Me and the bride were friends in college,

01:21.372 --> 01:25.627
but her group of friends
weren't really my main crew.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.004
-Mm-hmm.
-So, we didn't keep in touch that much.

01:28.087 --> 01:32.133
Yeah, I'm not really friends with anyone
from college, except for this guy Aaron.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.678
I told you about him. His mom went
to prom with the Unabomber.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.723
What?

01:39.182 --> 01:41.226
His mom went to prom with the Unabomber.

01:41.309 --> 01:45.396
Oh, yes. I remember you
telling me that.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.941
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
You want to get a drink?

01:48.024 --> 01:50.527
Yeah, uh, you want anything?

01:50.610 --> 01:52.570
Yeah, could I get a Jägermeister?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.283
Oh, nice. Nice.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.460
Hey.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.795
What can I get you, sir?

02:08.878 --> 02:13.133
Yeah. Could I get a water
and another water? Thanks.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.233
-Gus! Hi!
-Hey!

02:30.900 --> 02:32.652
-Hello, there.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.988
-Good, great. Yeah.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.489
-Good. That's awesome.
-Yeah.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.492
-Yeah, it's good to see ya. Yeah.
-Yeah, you too.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.785
Um...

02:41.661 --> 02:43.872
Yeah, I thought I might see you here.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.748
-I know, the same. Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.543
-I thought I might see me here, too.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.673
Um, so can you believe this,
that Leah's getting married?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.300
-Oh, I know.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.093
I know, it seems just like yesterday

02:57.177 --> 03:01.556
she was peeing in a bush,
drunk, outside our dorm.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.349
I actually forgot about that.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.269
-Yeah. It's weird.

03:06.352 --> 03:10.481
So, uh, anybody else here
from the old college crew?

03:10.565 --> 03:14.068
Oh, yeah.
Um, Megan and Katie and you and me.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.695
-So...

03:15.778 --> 03:17.780
Yeah. Yeah, we're a dying breed.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.699
-I'll say. Yeah.
-So... Yeah.

03:19.782 --> 03:20.867
It's a real shame.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.369
Yeah. Do you see Leah much in LA or...

03:23.453 --> 03:24.662
No. Not really.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.748
Yeah, I think she only invited me

03:26.831 --> 03:29.709
so it wouldn't be uncomfortable if we
bumped in each other at a Panera.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.085
-Right. Right.
-Yeah.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.337
Here you go.
-Yeah.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.756
Thank you. Sarah, do you want anything?

03:34.839 --> 03:37.008
-Yeah.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.218
Thank you.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.679
Um, so, two waters,
are you pretty thirsty or...

03:41.763 --> 03:46.100
Oh. Yeah, no, this is
for me and my girlfriend Mickey.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.268
She's here. Yeah.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.312
-Oh, cool. Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah. Cool.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.814
-That's great.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.399
No, I'm just flying solo.

03:53.483 --> 03:58.363
-So, yeah. Very cool.

03:58.446 --> 04:01.241
-Uh, well, there's that.
-Um... There's that.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.034
-So, uh...
-Yeah.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.370
-So good to see you.
-So good to see you, too.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.330
-I'm glad we got to see each other.
-Yeah, yeah.

04:07.413 --> 04:11.668
Let's catch up later. I want to hear
all about what's going in Gus world.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.461
-I want to meet Mickey.
-Okay.

04:13.544 --> 04:14.587
-That would be fun.
-Yeah.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.798
I'd love to know what's in Sarah world.
All right.

04:16.881 --> 04:21.177
-Too many liquids, yeah.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.222
-But it was really nice seeing you.
-Yeah. You too.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.436
-Hey.
Hey.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.106
-Here's your water. Yeah.
-Oh, thank you.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.315
Who's that you were talking to?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.903
Oh, that was, um, Sarah.
We actually used to go out.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.532
-Mm-hmm. I picked up on that vibe.
-There was no vibe.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.201
-There was electricity between you two.
-You don't know what you're talking about.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.912
No, no. Ex-electricity.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.414
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.790
Were you two serious?

04:51.249 --> 04:56.045
Uh... no. I mean,
serious in a college way, but, you know...

04:56.129 --> 04:58.548
I liked M. Night Shyamalan in college,
so, what do I know?

04:58.631 --> 04:59.465
Yeah.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.678
You know what? I think we're on the move.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.763
-So maybe we should skedaddle.
-All right.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.301
What's that?

05:43.384 --> 05:46.012
I mean, I wouldn't want
my wedding like this.

05:46.095 --> 05:50.308
I'd want a lot more people. I want it
to feel like a big party, but it's nice.

05:50.391 --> 05:54.103
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.064
-Haven't really thought about it.
-Mm-hmm.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.607
I've thought about it.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.651
I just don't have any strong feelings,
one way or the other.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.821
-But, um, yeah, I like big weddings.
-Yeah.

06:08.618 --> 06:13.122
Oh, wow. Little Gussy!
-Hey. Hi, Katie.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.250
-Hey. Gus, this is Matt, my husband.
Good to see you.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.377
Matt, this is Gus.
We went to college together.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.379
Hey.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.423
-Oh. Hi. I'm Katie.
-Oh, hi.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.675
Oh, where are my manners?
Katie, this is Mickey.

06:24.759 --> 06:28.304
Mickey, Katie. Matt and Sarah.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.933
It's so nice to meet you, Mickey.
I love your dress. It's gorgeous.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.810
Oh, thank you.
I love your earrings.

06:33.893 --> 06:38.064
Oh, thank you. I thought they were
a little too much, so I appreciate that.

06:38.147 --> 06:41.275
Pretty earrings, pretty dress. All right.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.326
-That was cute. Aw...
-Yeah, that was nice.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.204
So, what'd you think of the ceremony?

06:53.287 --> 06:55.331
-Beautiful.
-Yeah, lovely.

06:55.414 --> 07:00.795
You think it's worth $110,000?
Because that's what this cost.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.631
Oh, my God. Wow.
That's a lot of money.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.383
Yeah.
-Yeah, enjoy.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.678
I paid $40,000 to rent this hotel.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.096
Shit.
-Yeah.

07:10.179 --> 07:13.558
And chairs. Oh, you want chairs, too?
Oh, on your wedding?

07:13.641 --> 07:16.269
Okay. $3,000 for the chairs.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.271
-Wow. This really adds up.
-Steep.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.482
-Yeah. The band, $8,000.

07:21.566 --> 07:25.111
And the bar, that's where
you really get fucked in the ass.

07:25.194 --> 07:29.198
They want to close at 11.
I said not on my time. Ten o'clock.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.368
'Cause they have all the friends drinking,
that's at my expense, okay.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.622
And the chicken,
eat the fucking chicken to the bone.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.833
I'll make sure you eat every piece
of fucking--

07:38.916 --> 07:41.586
-We'll eat that chicken.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.337
-You eat that chicken.
Okay.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.965
You know why I'm paying for all this?

07:46.048 --> 07:51.387
Because the bride's parents
are fucking broke. Fucking broke.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.144
-I think I just met my new best friend.
-He's awesome.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.231
Where is that chicken, by the way?
I'm so hungry.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.818
-Yeah, me too. I'm starvin', Marvin.
-Oh, look, there's Sarah.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.700
-Oh, look at that.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.536
Nah, I think we're good.
We don't need to.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.413
She's standing all by herself.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.790
You guys already met and stuff, so...

08:19.874 --> 08:22.460
That seems rude,
leaving her alone over there.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.588
-Yeah.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.758
-Sarah, hi. Hi.
Hello.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.468
-Let's do it. Okay, awesome.
-Okay, cool.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.053
-Hi.
Hi.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.307
Good, we're good.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.684
I know.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.936
-Yeah.
Yeah.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.688
Just watching Clay and Leah,
they just look so in love.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.107
-It was just beautiful. It was so nice.
-Special. Yeah.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.611
Yeah. You know what'd be nice?
If we were eating right now.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.279
-I'm so hungry.
-Yes.

08:50.363 --> 08:54.408
We have to wait for them to take
300 photos underneath a tree or something.

08:54.492 --> 08:58.538
Oh, right. Totally. I know, couldn't they
have found that tree earlier today?

09:01.290 --> 09:02.583
Yeah.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.127
So when did you get into town, Sarah?

09:05.211 --> 09:08.256
-Uh, yesterday morning. Yeah.
-Okay.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.550
-Denver. Yeah.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.926
Oh, nice.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.637
I mean, if you love beautiful trees
and beautiful mountains,

09:14.720 --> 09:17.223
there are definitely worse places to live.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.435
-Yeah.

09:21.519 --> 09:26.148
Oh, you know, it's very crazy to be back
because I feel like it's all so different.

09:26.232 --> 09:31.028
And honestly,
I did not move away that long ago. Right?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.822
-Yeah.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.158
-Yeah. Yes, Sarah used to live here.
Oh, got it, yeah.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.869
I can't remember
exactly how long ago, but...

09:38.953 --> 09:40.830
When did we have that apartment together?

09:42.206 --> 09:46.919
Six years ago?
-Yeah.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.839
Something like that. Yeah.
-Yeah. That makes sense.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.175
So, when did you get into town?

09:54.969 --> 09:57.138
-Yesterday morning. You said that.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.848
You know what, I almost forgot too, so...

09:58.931 --> 10:02.518
-Yeah, now we know.
-Um, yeah.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.354
And elephant in the room,
Gus and I used to date,

10:05.438 --> 10:06.981
but, honestly, who cares?

10:07.064 --> 10:08.566
-I'm so happy for you, Gus.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.695
It's so nice to see you guys together.
It truly warms my heart.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.239
-Thank you. So nice.
-That's very sweet of you to say.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.950
Oh, it looks like
the food is coming out, Mickey.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.328
Looks like those photos are over, finally.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.040
-See you guys there. Bon appétit.
-Okay. All right.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.586
-No.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.962
I mean, like, a little.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.381
Uh, I don't think so.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.092
I don't care, it just seemed like
there was a lot going on there.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.262
-Yeah, you're probably right there.
-Yeah.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.056
-No.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.183
Why didn't you tell me
you lived together?

10:43.225 --> 10:47.063
You know, I thought I did.
We were at that dinner party, remember?

10:47.146 --> 10:49.231
Everybody was talking
about people they lived with.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.526
I'm pretty sure I said
I lived with this girl Sarah.

10:52.610 --> 10:53.736
-I don't know.
-Maybe I didn't.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.281
I'm sorry, I get a little awkward
around exes,

10:57.365 --> 10:59.617
-Yeah.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.619
Just want to have fun tonight.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.954
I'm not the one
who's not having fun.

11:04.038 --> 11:08.376
No, I know. But it's all done with,
it's taken care of.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.586
We don't have to see her
for the rest of the night.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.504
Yeah.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.926
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome,

11:17.009 --> 11:19.637
for the very first time,
Clay and Leah Reddy.

All right, a toast.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.293
Um, to the University of South Dakota.

11:51.377 --> 11:55.214
Uh, the best state school
that our parents could afford.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.924
Go, Coyotes!

11:59.593 --> 12:02.346
Cheers.
That's very good. Cheers.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.977
Oh, yeah, please, thank you.
So, did you notice that, like...

12:08.060 --> 12:11.480
No. Nope.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.899
We met him at the rehearsal dinner.
Really sweet guy.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.317
Aw, that's nice.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.529
-No, no.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.657
Oh, he took her to the park
where they had their first date.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.783
Aw.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.578
-Very neat.
-That is very thoughtful. Very sweet.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.748
It tops Jim's proposal,
who decided to propose on the phone.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.083
-Okay.
-Jim!

12:31.167 --> 12:32.543
All right, come on.

12:32.626 --> 12:37.131
I was at my grandma's funeral,
and I saw how upset my grandpa was.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.134
It got me thinking about who I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.760
Mm-hmm.
So, you know...

12:41.844 --> 12:43.971
I know. It was sweet.
It was sweet.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.055
-Very sweet.
-Anyways...

12:45.139 --> 12:47.892
I'm not big on the whole
elaborate proposal thing anyways.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.518
No, those can be so cheesy.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.771
Thank you. Who were they
talking about last night?

12:52.855 --> 12:57.067
This one guy, he flies his parents to LA,
and the girl's parents,

12:57.151 --> 13:00.571
and proposed at the observatory
or some ridiculous place like that.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.739
I don't remember.

13:01.822 --> 13:05.618
Yes, you do. And when she said yes,
a violinist popped out

13:05.701 --> 13:08.579
and started playing "Maybe I'm Amazed."
Remember?

13:08.662 --> 13:10.080
I think you're confused.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.338
Shit. Okay, never mind.

13:17.421 --> 13:20.549
Wait. Was that you?
-Yeah.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.218
I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.053
-No, I shouldn't have...
-No.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.971
Everybody said
it was a really nice proposal, so...

13:26.055 --> 13:29.350
No, it was bad. The weather was bad,
the violin player was bad.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.811
It was stupid. It was dumb.
It was a really stupid thing.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.318
Yes. Yes.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.947
Very briefly.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.703
Um, hi, everybody.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.999
Um, I would like to make a toast,
if that's all right.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.335
Um, I'm Sarah, Sarah Miller.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.671
I'm one of Leah's friends from college.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.464
Speaking of which,

14:00.548 --> 14:03.384
this is the college table
representing right here.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.554
So... Go, Coyotes. Right?

14:06.637 --> 14:08.472
-Whoo!

14:08.556 --> 14:12.560
Um, I just want to say, I still remember

14:12.643 --> 14:16.480
when Leah first called me
to tell me about this Clay fella.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.441
And she said, "I just went out
on a date with this guy Clay,

14:19.525 --> 14:20.776
and I think he might be the one."

14:21.318 --> 14:25.739
And I said, "Leah,
listen to me very closely.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.034
Does he have a friend?

14:34.498 --> 14:40.129
Um, in all seriousness, it's really rare
that someone finds their soul mate,

14:40.212 --> 14:45.426
and Clay and Leah, you guys have found
each other and you guys are soul mates.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.513
Um... Yeah, okay. So, to Clay and Leah.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.098
Cheers.

Hey, I'm sorry
about that engagement stuff.

15:33.057 --> 15:38.145
Mickey, really, I...  I didn't mean
it to catch you off guard or anything.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.731
I'm just trying to put
this time line together in my head.

15:40.814 --> 15:44.109
So, you guys dated in college
and then you moved to LA together?

15:44.193 --> 15:47.196
-Right.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.616
Yeah, but it was only
for, like, a very short amount of time.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.077
It was, like, a month
and then we broke it off, so...

15:53.160 --> 15:56.664
Mm-hmm. So when I asked you if things
ever got serious, and you said no...

15:57.957 --> 16:02.294
I meant it. No, seriously.
'Cause it never felt serious.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.382
It always felt like we were
two kids pretending to get engaged.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.050
You can downplay it now,

16:08.133 --> 16:13.305
but the fact that you hid it from me
means that it means something to you.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.268
Oh, because you've told me
every single thing

16:18.352 --> 16:21.271
about what's gone on
between you and your exes?

16:21.772 --> 16:23.857
There's nothing hidden or secret?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.360
I mean, I don't...

16:26.443 --> 16:28.112
Just because somebody
keeps something secret

16:28.195 --> 16:32.199
doesn't mean it's this big, bad thing
I don't want to tell you about, okay?

16:32.282 --> 16:33.993
I mean, we were bad together.

16:34.076 --> 16:39.331
And she had this, like,
wounded soul type of thing going on.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.418
Oh, so, maybe that's your thing.
I guess I am your type.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.920
I don't think you're a wounded soul.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.674
Okay, she was more of this people pleaser.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.384
Oh, so, now she sounds like you.

16:51.719 --> 16:56.557
Mickey, what do you want me to say? Okay.
She sucked. She was awful.

16:56.640 --> 17:01.645
She would kiss the whole world's ass
and then come home and be mean to me.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.980
Okay? You're not like that.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.316
It's what I love about you.
You're the opposite of her in every way.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.279
She's touchy and feely. I would touch
her elbow, and she would have this orgasm.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.406
Why would you tell me that?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.533
So you knew what a weirdo she was.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.912
All right, should we just leave?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.958
We don't have to run out right away.
We could stick around.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.794
I think I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.757
-No, I'm good.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.219
Fuck.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.062
Hey, there. Hi.
-Oh, hi.

17:48.275 --> 17:53.363
-I just came up to get some fresh air...
-I'm not stalking you, I swear.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.407
Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:56.283 --> 18:01.246
I quit, like, three years ago,
but I slip up every few weeks.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.625
Well, you're doing better than me.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.668
-I never managed to quit.
-Oh.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.775
Yeah. I mean, I can't control
what comes up in my news feed,

18:29.858 --> 18:33.278
but I remember seeing a picture
of you guys together for the first time

18:33.362 --> 18:36.532
and being like, "Wow. She's really pretty.
I kind of hate her."

18:37.533 --> 18:38.659
Okay.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.577
Also, you got him dressing really well.

18:40.661 --> 18:45.290
Like, congrats on that,
because his style has gone way up.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.750
Thank you for noticing.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.838
Mmm.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.550
But what about you?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.177
Are you seeing somebody now?
What's going on?

18:57.719 --> 19:00.305
Oh, no. Flying solo.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.391
Um...

19:03.058 --> 19:05.894
Actually, uh, don't get sad

19:05.978 --> 19:08.981
'cause people sometimes
get sad when they hear this,

19:09.064 --> 19:12.484
but I've been divorced
for a year, so...

19:13.819 --> 19:16.947
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, no. It was for the best.

19:17.030 --> 19:20.117

you guys make each other laugh.

And I know his fake laugh, so...

19:30.294 --> 19:33.922
You know, I think I'm gonna go get
another drink if you want one?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.632
-Oh, I don't drink.
-Oh, gotcha.

19:35.716 --> 19:41.430
Yeah, I don't really drink, either.
Just weddings, I kind of do, so...

this complicated, okay?

No. We just drive her there, drop her off.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.402
Make sure she gets in okay
and then we go home.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.446
What is this all about?
You said she sucked

24:49.529 --> 24:51.114
and now you're acting like you're
in love with her.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.200
I'm not in love with her.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.951
Well, you proposed to her.

24:55.035 --> 24:58.538
And then you hid it from me.
What the fuck is this, Gus?

24:58.622 --> 25:00.123
What do you mean, "What the fuck"?

25:00.207 --> 25:03.084
She's asking me for help,
and I want to give her a ride.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.253
I'm going to do it with or without you.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.926
I'll see you back home.

25:26.274 --> 25:32.739
I feel really bad for Leah, you know,
because the band ruined her wedding.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.492
I don't know.

25:35.575 --> 25:39.579
It seemed like a lot of people were out
on the floor dancing, having a good time.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.332
Oh, yeah. Well, guess what, band?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.126
You're fired.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.757
-Yeah. It's okay.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.928
Thank you.
Yeah.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.513
You're escorting me home.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.649
Home sweet home.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.030
This bed feels so good.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.409
Good, good, good, good. Um...

26:18.785 --> 26:21.955
-No.

26:22.038 --> 26:24.124
-It was good to see you.
-Please have a seat.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.626
No, I really... I should hit the road.

26:26.710 --> 26:30.297
Have a seat for one second.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.469
Okay.

26:42.767 --> 26:49.149
So, you heard that I got divorced.
That's very embarrassing.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.029
Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.741
Why are you so far away?
You're across the room.

26:57.824 --> 27:02.245
Well, please, come...
You got to be on here.

27:04.122 --> 27:07.334
-But... please.
-Okay, okay. Yeah.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.962
Just for a couple minutes though, okay?

27:11.046 --> 27:14.299
No, I'm not timing it.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.885
-No, no, no.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.726
So, here's the story.
You're gonna love it.

27:25.185 --> 27:30.690
I met a guy in Denver.
I thought he was perfect as can be.

27:31.858 --> 27:34.361
Here's the kicker.

27:34.444 --> 27:41.368
He had kids from his wife
that he was married to when we met.

27:43.119 --> 27:48.458
Well, he said, "I don't really
like her that much, and I love you."

27:49.709 --> 27:55.924
And I, well, thought,
"Oh, he wants to marry me."

27:56.007 --> 28:00.387
I didn't think,
"Oh, I'll break up a family." No.

28:01.429 --> 28:05.892
But, please, I can't...
Please don't judge me on this part.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.938
-Don't judge me on it.
-No, I won't.

28:10.772 --> 28:13.566
Okay, this you won't believe.

28:15.193 --> 28:18.405
I became a stay-at-home mom.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.243
I became a stepmom.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.959
Three.
-Oh, uh...

28:31.960 --> 28:34.129
Wow. Oof.

28:34.212 --> 28:39.300
That sounds mega, uh, stressful, but...

28:41.219 --> 28:42.512
Three kids.

28:44.764 --> 28:49.436
Well, it took about four years

28:50.562 --> 28:57.110
for them to, like,
not be little assholes to me.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.906
Well, one of them is just, like,
born a creep.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.034
And then...

29:07.370 --> 29:10.749
And then one day, he just left me...

29:11.374 --> 29:12.667
for, like...

29:13.710 --> 29:15.795
another lady.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.589
And...

29:18.173 --> 29:23.720
now I'm at, like...
now I'm at this weird age

29:25.054 --> 29:29.809
where, like, I'm too young to be divorced,

29:31.978 --> 29:37.275
but I'm too old to be, like,
dating everybody.

29:38.526 --> 29:41.696
And too old for my career.

29:44.574 --> 29:49.579
And now I don't have any of it.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.377
I'm sorry.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.926
I think everything's gonna be okay.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.888
That's bullshit. You don't know that.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.683
You don't even really know me.
I mean...

30:10.767 --> 30:13.436
For, like, five years, we didn't talk.

30:15.021 --> 30:19.734
You can't say stuff like that
if you're not informed.

30:23.029 --> 30:25.782
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.
That was...

30:25.865 --> 30:28.159
No, no, no. It's... No.

30:28.243 --> 30:33.957
You know what? Let's just...
We had a fun time at the wedding, right?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.252
Yeah, yeah. It was fun.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.421
I had a fun...

30:41.673 --> 30:45.718
And the best part is... they're happy.

30:47.846 --> 30:52.433
So, at least one of us is happy.

30:54.143 --> 30:58.982
I think that's a-- that's the good part.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.193
That one of us is happy.
