WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:08.883
Are you
swallowing them whole?

00:08.967 --> 00:11.844
You're eating them so fast,
are they even
touching your tongue?

00:11.929 --> 00:12.929
Yes.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.055
Why aren't you
having any, Angela?

00:14.139 --> 00:18.351
Oh, l ate so many already
when no one was looking.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.353
(LAUGHlNG)
Yeah, right.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.814
My baby's dieting.

00:22.981 --> 00:26.109
She wants to fit into
a special child-size
wedding gown for our big day.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.485
Why do those exist?

00:27.569 --> 00:29.028
lt's from
my pageant days.

00:29.113 --> 00:32.073
l was
Miss Tiny Mid-Atlantic Bride
when l was 1 0.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.324
Probably heard of it.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.284
Brownies, is it?

00:35.619 --> 00:37.286
Pastry cubes
made of sugar and fat?

00:37.371 --> 00:38.913
No, thank you.
l'll stick with my jerky.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.206
So why'd you
come in here?

00:40.290 --> 00:41.791
To socialize.
And inform.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.211
Brownies!
l'm taking two,

00:45.295 --> 00:49.257
so l can parcel them up
and eat them
at my leisure later on.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.466
Much healthier.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.759
You taking two?

00:51.844 --> 00:54.470
Yeah, but one of them
is for Toby.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.557
Yeah. Why don't you
send that to him
in Costa Rica?

00:57.641 --> 01:00.184
l'm just gonna hand
it to him right now.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.894
Okay, weirdo.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.354
Why's that?
Why's that weird?

01:03.439 --> 01:06.274
She said she was going to
give it to him right now.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.901
She's probably going to
because they
sit next to each other.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.695
Yeah, they used to.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.739
Toby works here again.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.407
Oh, can you imagine?

01:14.491 --> 01:17.243
Oh, no.
You don't know.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.911
l don't know. What?

01:18.996 --> 01:21.497
You should probably
just meander back there,

01:21.623 --> 01:23.958
take a look,
see if he's back.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.251
Dare l?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.335
(LAUGHS)

01:26.420 --> 01:29.464
You know what?
l'm going to,
for old time's sake.

01:39.349 --> 01:42.018
Great practical joke, Jim.
Got me to go to the annex.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.023
Hi, Michael.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.232
(SCREAMlNG) No! God !

01:49.193 --> 01:53.321
No, God, please, no!
No! No!

01:54.239 --> 01:55.281
No!

02:27.439 --> 02:30.399
l blame the two of you.
This is your fault.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.777
Michael, Dwight and l
were talking about this,

02:32.861 --> 02:36.197
and we both don't understand
how you didn't realize
Toby was back.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.490
l'm concerned
you may have brain damage.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.661
You cannot expect me
to keep track
of all of my personnel.

02:41.745 --> 02:45.665
There are a lot of people
here and a lot of different
shapes and sizes.

02:45.749 --> 02:50.378
And there is nothing that
is even vaguely interesting
about the way that he looks.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.921
So, l'm off the hook.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.298
Maybe you cleaned your ears
too vigorously with Q-tips.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.092
l know where this is going.
You hurt the temporal lobe. . .

02:56.176 --> 02:57.844
l'm not going to stop
putting Q-tips
in my ears.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.221
l don't care
how much it hurts!

03:01.849 --> 03:03.599
Maybe l just block Toby
from my mind.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.893
Oh, interesting.
Continue.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.105
Like someone
who's molested.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.192
Doesn't remember it
for years.
Toxic Shock Syndrome.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.861
Maybe it's
Stockholm Syndrome.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.821
Maybe it's
China syndrome.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.948
Could be any one of them.
lt's a messed up world.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.033
lt is a messed up world.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.953
But it's our messed up world.

03:32.588 --> 03:35.965
Oh, come on !
Do you see this?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.468
Disgusting.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.473
MlCHAEL: Look at him.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.435
With his stupid face.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.230
Stupid tan.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.609
Yeah.
He looks great.
Well-rested.

03:54.693 --> 03:55.860
No. He looks worse.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.945
(PHONE RlNGlNG)

04:04.620 --> 04:05.620
Yeah.

04:05.704 --> 04:06.829
WOMAN: David WaIIace
is on the Iine for you.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.624
Thank God. David, hello.
We need your help.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.250
DAVlD: Michael,
is everyone okay?

04:11.335 --> 04:13.336
Oh, well,
l'm afraid not.

04:13.420 --> 04:18.007
Toby Flenderson
of HR has made
a sudden reappearance.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.718
I don't understand.
Is anyone hurt?

04:20.802 --> 04:24.847
Not on the surface, no.
But l can tell
people are disturbed, David.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.768
MichaeI, you texted me,
"91 1 , call me."

04:28.852 --> 04:30.645
Yes.
AII in caps.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.730
Do you know
what "91 1 " means?

04:32.814 --> 04:35.191
l learned a while back
that if l don't text "91 1 ,"

04:35.275 --> 04:37.777
people will not
return my calls.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.946
But now people
always return my calls,

04:40.030 --> 04:44.241
because they think
that something horrible
has happened.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.453
DAVID: Toby was hired back
because
he knows the branch,

04:47.537 --> 04:51.207
he was available,
and I Iike him. Okay?
And that's that.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.293
With all due respect, David,
this hardly seems
like a dialog.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.170
That's because
it isn't, Michael.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.299
Now, what l'm curious
about is how you were abIe
to go an entire week

05:00.384 --> 05:02.426
without knowing
a member of your staff
was there.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.346
l did not want to
go back to the annex

05:05.430 --> 05:08.140
because that is where
Holly worked,
whom l loved.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.392
Also, it's icky back there.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.727
That's true.
People say it's icky.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.481
Okay. I have to go.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.066
David, wait.
No.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.485
ls there no way
we can get rid of him?

05:19.569 --> 05:21.028
Not without cause, Michael.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.530
l have cause.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.615
lt is because l hate him.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.493
You have to get
aIong with Toby.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.744
No.
Yep.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.829
l don't.

05:29.913 --> 05:30.955
Goodbye, MichaeI.

05:34.918 --> 05:35.960
Don't do that.

05:36.211 --> 05:40.297
So, Tunes,
you still going to buy
your old man's place?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.550
Yeah, l am. Wait.
How do you know that?

05:42.634 --> 05:44.343
l didn't tell you that.

05:44.428 --> 05:45.845
No, l was just
walking by your desk.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.388
l saw some e-mails.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.515
l got peepers
of an eagle.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.599
That's really not cool.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.684
So, Jim,

05:51.768 --> 05:53.310
you're going to live
in the same house

05:53.395 --> 05:55.646
that you used to
pee the bed in?

05:55.731 --> 05:58.065
Yeah. l guess,
technically, Kev,
you're right.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.359
Today's a big day.
Today's the day

06:00.444 --> 06:03.612
that l show Pam
the house
that l bought for us.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.780
Without telling her.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.700
But it's my parents' house,
the house I grew up in.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.161
And, yeah, I bought
it kind of impuIsiveIy.

06:10.245 --> 06:13.956
I mean, the price was good,
and I was heIping out my mom.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.042
It's got shag carpets.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.377
l mean,
you can't bIame my parents.
It was the '70s.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.589
And why wouId you want to buy
ugIy wood from trees

06:21.673 --> 06:25.384
when you can have paneIing
and a painting
of some creepy cIowns

06:25.469 --> 06:28.846
that is apparentIy cruciaI
to the structuraI integrity
of the buiIding?

06:29.473 --> 06:31.223
She's gonna love it.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.309
Right?

06:33.727 --> 06:34.769
Could you guys
all do me a favor

06:34.853 --> 06:36.729
and just not talk about
this until l tell Pam?

06:36.813 --> 06:37.897
That'd be great.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.566
You haven't told
the missus
about the castle?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.276
You're in
for a spanking,
my friend.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.904
Myself and my lady,
no secrets.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.697
PHYLLlS:
Jim, don't listen to Andy.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.407
l think it's so romantic.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.617
JlM: Oh, thanks, Phyllis.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.078
Bob bought our house without
consulting me and l loved it.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.829
Yeah? You didn't mind
not choosing?

06:53.914 --> 06:54.914
Oh, no. Not at all.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.250
But Bob's so extravagant,
l knew
it would be spectacular.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.170
There's a maze
in the back
like The Shining.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.797
Where's your place?

07:02.881 --> 07:05.674
lt's on Linden Ave. ,
by the quarry.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.095
Cool beans, man.
l live by the quarry.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.973
We should hang out
by the quarry and
throw things down there.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.059
Definitely, we should.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.812
OSCAR: "To whoever made
the microwave mess.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.897
"The microwave is
a shared kitchen appliance.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.441
"By not cleaning it up,
you are basically
telling whoever follows

07:22.526 --> 07:24.026
"that their time
is less valuable,

07:24.111 --> 07:27.154
"as they will have to
scrub out
your disgusting splatter.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.949
"Sincerely,
Disappointed."

07:30.033 --> 07:32.118
That is just obnoxious.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.869
OSCAR: No kidding.
Yeah.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.748
Wait, what?
The mess or the note?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.917
The note.
So "holier than thou."

07:41.545 --> 07:42.711
l liked it.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.130
Don't you think
the person
who left the mess

07:44.214 --> 07:45.297
is the obnoxious one?

07:45.382 --> 07:46.882
No.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.510
The note is way more
obnoxious than the mess.

07:49.594 --> 07:54.098
"Sincerely, Disappointed."
Get off
your high horse, richie.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.976
Just because
someone likes things clean
doesn't mean they're rich.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.061
Nah. They're rich.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.648
Yeah, l wrote the note.
Not ashamed of it.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.734
l'm not proud of it.
lt is what it is.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.737
Everyone keeps asking me
if l wrote the note
on the microwave.

08:08.822 --> 08:12.074
lt was rude and condescending
and a little snotty.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.327
l wish l had written it.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.000
(READlNG)

08:27.924 --> 08:29.258
The nerve!

08:32.470 --> 08:35.181
You want to see some
real high-caliber acting?

08:35.265 --> 08:38.058
Well, Mr. Kurt Russell,
you are about to be served.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.855
Hey, Toby.

08:42.939 --> 08:46.192
Great to have you back, man.
Seriously. Just. . .

08:46.276 --> 08:49.320
Just a real pleasure
to see you again.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.362
Thanks, Michael.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.655
You're welcome.
Missed you.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.033
Missed you
as part of our family.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.328
Well, that's sweet.
l missed you guys, too.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.583
So Costa Rica, that was. . .

09:03.418 --> 09:05.586
Did you have fun?
That must have been fun.

09:05.670 --> 09:10.216
Well, it was amazing,
really was.
Thanks for asking.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.717
Beaches were pristine.

09:11.801 --> 09:12.885
Nice beaches,
pristine beaches?

09:12.969 --> 09:14.261
Yeah.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.639
The whole thing was
incredibly cathartic.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.891
Why'd you come back?
Why didn't you stay?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.018
Well, it's actually
kind of hard
to meet people, l found.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.728
l bet. For you.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.314
And, yeah. . .
Plus, it was hot.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.609
Hot. Why didn't
you get an air. . .

09:28.693 --> 09:30.945
Should've gotten
an air conditioner
for yourself.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.112
Are you
all right, Michael?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.531
Yeah, l am. l am.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.700
l tried. l tried.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.913
l tried to talk to Toby
and be his friend,

09:40.997 --> 09:45.584
but that is like
trying to be friends
with an evil snail.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.338
l feel like
l'm dying inside.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.884
l feel like
Neve Campbell
in Scream 2.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.720
She thinks she can
go off to college
and be happy.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.807
And then,
the murderer comes back

09:59.891 --> 10:02.184
and starts killing off
all of her friends.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.064
Learned a lot of lessons
from that movie.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.607
This is just one of them.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.361
Okay, just summarize.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.280
Okay,
fireable offenses include

10:14.364 --> 10:16.448
workplace violence
and sexual harassment.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.575
That's it.
That's it, perfect.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.369
We will get him
to hit on somebody,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.037
and then we'll
catch him in the act.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.123
l love catching
people in the act.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.457
That's why l always
whip open doors.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.583
Me, too.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.960
Okay,
let's get this started.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.211
Okay.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.214
What are you doing?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.549
l am the bait.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.633
For what?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.593
Men find me desirable.
No, no, no.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.637
lt's a good day, too.
l'm wearing my mustard shirt.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.972
You're the bait for Toby?

10:40.056 --> 10:43.225
No. For one thing,
he's not gay.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.144
And if somebody
were to be bait,

10:45.228 --> 10:48.397
it would be Jim
or Ryan or me.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.107
Men find me desirable.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.233
Yes.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.402
Sure they do, Dwight.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.904
When it comes down to it,
it's a health issue.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.323
l should've written that.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.824
Yeah.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.870
Why aren't you as mad
or interested in this
as me?

11:02.954 --> 11:06.665
Oh, totally.
Sorry, are we talking about
the microwave still?

11:06.750 --> 11:08.167
Are you inching away
from me?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.335
No.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.170
Reach your arms out.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.173
l'm always this close.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.509
(SlNGlNG) Pamtown Iadies
sing this song
doo-dah doo-dah

11:17.594 --> 11:18.761
Hello, Pam.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.554
Jim, may l have
a moment with Pam,
please?

11:20.638 --> 11:21.680
(CELL PHONE RlNGS)

11:21.765 --> 11:24.266
Yes. l just have to
take this call anyway,
so. . .

11:24.351 --> 11:28.020
His mistress!
No, l'm kidding.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.646
No one would
ever cheat on you.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.190
You are
the complete package, Pam.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.316
What do you need, Michael?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.277
Okay, what l would
like you to do
is take this folded note

11:35.362 --> 11:39.031
and deliver it to
Toby Flenderson.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.618
l want you to just react
to whatever
this note elicits.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.370
Do not read it
beforehand.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.537
Can you do that for me?

11:45.622 --> 11:46.997
Sure.
Good.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.291
No, no, no, no, don't. . .

11:49.376 --> 11:51.794
"Please hug and kiss me,
no matter how hard l struggle.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.504
"l am too shy to tell you
that l love you."

11:53.588 --> 11:56.131
Damn it, Pam.
You gave me your word.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.263
You have a good day?

12:05.475 --> 12:08.310
Hey. Hey, guys,
that's really
inappropriate.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.065
What's up?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.401
l got some photos
from Costa Rica

12:15.485 --> 12:17.111
if you want to see them.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.946
Yeah, yeah, l'll see them.
Cool.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.407
Toby, can l see those?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.909
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
You scared?

12:23.993 --> 12:24.993
Okay, those are
fighting words.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.078
You mad?
You mad at me?

12:26.162 --> 12:27.663
l hope he doesn't
haul off
and just hit you.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.289
Do you want to do that?
Do you want to hit me?

12:29.374 --> 12:31.250
You want to punch me?

12:31.334 --> 12:33.210
MlCHAEL: He might do it.
l dare you to.
Punch him, Toby.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.503
Come on.
Come on. . .

12:34.587 --> 12:35.587
What's the matter?

12:35.672 --> 12:37.214
Hit him.
Hit him, chicken !

12:37.340 --> 12:38.674
Yeah, punch him.
Hey, hey.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.259
Come on, Ryan.
Whose side are you on?

12:40.343 --> 12:41.427
DWlGHT: Ryan, come on, man.

12:41.511 --> 12:42.678
No, do it. Do it.
l dare you.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.929
Punch him as hard
as you possibly can

12:44.013 --> 12:45.264
in the face.
l dare you, Flenderson.

12:45.348 --> 12:46.432
Not. . .
Not as hard
as you can.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.683
Just a good,
solid punch.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.767
Come on, come on.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.270
l'm not going to
punch you, Michael.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.981
Are you really not
going to punch him?

12:54.065 --> 12:55.357
No, why would l punch you?

12:55.442 --> 12:56.984
Son of a bitch.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.619
Should have hit him, man.
The guy was asking for it.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.663
Once in a lifetime, man.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.960
"Hey, whoever
was bashing the first note,
grow up.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.172
"The microwave is filthy
and no one here is a maid."

13:18.256 --> 13:20.757
See? Someone
around here is sane.

13:21.593 --> 13:25.220
"You are all a bunch of idiots
and privileged ass-wipes
who weren't raised right.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.432
"lf l find you,
l'm gonna
knock your teeth out."

13:29.058 --> 13:31.643
Yikes.
That's a little
over the top.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.229
Their heart's
in the right place.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.155
l thought you were
going to
parcel those out

13:43.239 --> 13:44.573
through the day.
Would you stop it?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.534
You haven't done
anything helpful all day.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.750
There's still
one thing we can do
to get Toby fired.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.251
What's that?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.590
Frame him for using drugs.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.634
Frame him?
Yeah.

14:03.718 --> 14:07.387
lt's illegal,
but everything they do
on The ShieId is illegal.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.723
l've never
framed a man before.
Have you?

14:09.807 --> 14:11.475
No, l've framed
animals before.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.186
l framed a raccoon
for opening
a Christmas present.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.523
And l framed a bear
for eating
out of the garbage.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.733
lt just seems
awfully mean.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.779
But sometimes,
the ends justify
the mean.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.956
Punch you, Michael.

14:42.799 --> 14:47.678
Hello.
l've seen you guys around.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.137
l'm Michael Scott,
Dunder Mifflin.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.889
How you doing?

14:54.811 --> 14:57.020
So l guess you
know why l'm here.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.231
l need to
purchase something.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.066
Like a fridge?
No.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.656
l wanted. . .

15:07.740 --> 15:09.992
l wanted to buy
some weed from someone.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.076
What?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.286
Grass, weed.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.080
What makes you think
we'd have weed?

15:15.164 --> 15:18.166
l heard you were drug. . .
l heard you dealt.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.841
Hey, just hold on
one second.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.680
l'm not wearing
a wire, so. . .

15:31.764 --> 15:33.557
Why would you
even say that?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.642
Hey, it's going
to be $500.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.311
How much?
$500.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.605
lt's a good price.
lt's a steal.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.897
How many pounds
is that?

15:40.982 --> 15:42.566
LEO: lt's two pounds.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.611
l'm losing money
on this, man,
just give me the money.

15:45.695 --> 15:46.653
Okay.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.488
All right. Walk away,
walk away, walk away.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.867
Hey, Pam? l just
wanted to let you know,

15:51.951 --> 15:55.454
l'm totally on your side
with the whole
microwave situation.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.164
Thank you.
l was just back there

15:57.248 --> 15:59.666
to make some Cup-a-Soup,
the thing
is still a huge mess.

15:59.751 --> 16:00.792
l know.
Can you believe it?

16:00.877 --> 16:02.794
Yeah, it's crazy.

16:02.879 --> 16:07.049
But l guess the thing is,
at some point,
notes or no notes,

16:07.133 --> 16:10.927
someone's going to
have to just get in there
and clean it up.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.765
l guess that's why
we have a temp, huh?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.644
Oh, no, trust me,
l would just
make it worse.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.479
How would wiping it
with a paper towel
make it worse?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.564
l would find a way.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.149
You've seen things
clean before though,
right?

16:24.233 --> 16:27.569
l. . . Pam,
l am hopeless
at that stuff.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.325
Hi, Michael.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.785
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.745
l forgot. . .
l forgot. . .

16:41.334 --> 16:42.501
DWlGHT: (WHlSPERlNG)
Yes. l repeat,

16:42.585 --> 16:45.045
a drug dealer
is on the premises
of Dunder Mifflin.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.422
His name is
Toby Flenderson.

16:47.548 --> 16:52.052
And he recently returned
from a mysterious vacation
in Central America.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.097
l have risked a great deal
to tell you this information.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.517
My name is Andy Bernard.
Andrew Bernard,
that's my name.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.060
See you soon.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.065
Pervert!

17:06.275 --> 17:07.526
Angela, l didn't
do that.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.736
So is this what
they taught you
at your fancy art school?

17:09.821 --> 17:11.697
Why would l draw
a penis on my own note?

17:11.781 --> 17:15.200
Why do you wear bright colors?
For attention, Pam.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.620
Everyone, l have
an announcement to make.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.959
l'm the person
who put the first note
on the microwave.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.586
But l did it because
it needed to be said.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.880
Why did you hide
behind anonymity?

17:28.965 --> 17:31.633
Because l was scared.
But if that's my only crime,

17:31.718 --> 17:34.261
is it a worse crime
than leaving
a filthy microwave?

17:34.345 --> 17:35.387
Amen.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.513
Don't.
This is for real.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.224
Just clean it up yourself
if it bothers you so much.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.392
lt's not my mess.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.645
lt would've taken less time
to clean it up
than to write all those notes.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.771
That's not the point.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.774
Listen, New York,
that might fly. . .

17:47.859 --> 17:50.402
Why? Because
l went to New York
for three months?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.404
That and the black sweater,
Manhattan.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.990
Okay, yes.
l went to New York,
everybody.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.908
l'm not gonna apologize
for it.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.454
l experienced more there
in one week than l experience
here in three months.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.913
l love New York.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.624
You know, l especially love
that people there
cleaned up after themselves.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.794
Well, l work too hard
all day to be
maid here, too.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.255
l got a mess to clean up
at home, plus
l'm a part-time maid.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.631
And what about
the penises?

18:11.716 --> 18:13.842
l thought those were funny.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.761
l didn't do them, Phyllis.
OSCAR: lt's the anonymity

18:15.845 --> 18:17.679
that l find so cowardly, Pam.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.765
Really? Can you just
get over that part?

18:19.849 --> 18:23.018
Why should l?
You couldn't get over
the messy microwave.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.519
What?

18:28.691 --> 18:29.775
l can't do this.

18:29.859 --> 18:30.942
Can't do what?

18:31.027 --> 18:34.571
lt's not fair to you
and it's really
not fair to me.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.115
Wait, what are you saying?
l broke up with Darryl
so l could be with you.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.534
That was your choice.
Don't put that on me.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.369
l'm just going
on a little trip.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.454
Can l come?

18:42.538 --> 18:43.789
lt's not
that kind of trip.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.832
l'm going to Thailand
with some friends
from high school.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.292
Well, a high school.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.294
And if l don't do it now,
l'll never get to go.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.462
And l'll always
resent you for it.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.506
You don't want me
to resent you, do you?

18:52.590 --> 18:53.882
So you're dumping me?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.842
Let's be adults about this.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.761
Let's have sex
one more time,

18:57.845 --> 19:00.472
and if you have
any extra cash,
that would be amazing.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.226
Okay.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.064
Hi. We received a call.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.982
l don't know
anything about that.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.277
We were tipped off
about a possible
narcotics situation.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.362
Here?

19:15.446 --> 19:17.030
Hey, Pam, hey,
l got this, okay?

19:17.114 --> 19:19.032
Hello, officers.
Dwight Schrute,

19:19.116 --> 19:20.826
former volunteer
sheriff's deputy.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.828
Listen, l may have
inside information

19:22.912 --> 19:26.122
that someone
is hiding drugs
in this very office.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.713
Just pretend
like we're talking
until the cops leave.

19:37.218 --> 19:40.220
Those are real cops.
Real guns.

19:40.304 --> 19:41.471
Wonder what's going on.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.766
Officers, l reveal to you
the perpetrator.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.351
Hey, what is this?
Search his things.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.894
Sir, could you
step away from
your desk, please?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.521
Why?
Sir, please step away
from your desk.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.730
Hey, what's going on?

19:50.815 --> 19:52.440
You don't have
my permission
to do this.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.192
They don't need
your permission,
Flenderson.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.111
They've got
the company's
permission.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.404
Hey, hey,
what are you. . .

19:57.488 --> 19:58.697
Why are you doing this?

19:58.781 --> 20:00.448
You know what?
l think this. . .

20:00.533 --> 20:01.825
This is probably
a misunderstanding.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.201
Don't search my stuff.
POLlCEMAN: Sir.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.579
l have a reasonable
right to privacy.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.706
Save your whining
for the jury there,
Flenderson.

20:07.790 --> 20:08.748
Yeah, let's just
cancel this, okay?

20:08.833 --> 20:09.833
TOBY: Michael?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.168
Sir, did you recently
return from a trip
to Central America?

20:12.253 --> 20:13.253
Oh, my God.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.296
l went to Costa Rica
for a few months.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.047
MlCHAEL: No, no, no.
That was legitimate.
What is going on?

20:16.132 --> 20:17.757
MlCHAEL:
That was totally legitimate.
Hey, check this out.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.175
MlCHAEL: Oh, God !
That is not mine.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.969
Turn around please.
l have never
seen this before.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.470
No, no, no, no, God !
What is going on here?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.055
No, that's. . .
l don't know
what that is.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.599
Do you have any weapons?
Of course not!

20:25.683 --> 20:27.392
l bet he has nothing
to do with that.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.560
That's mine.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.644
No, Michael, no!

20:29.729 --> 20:30.729
Yes, it's mine.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.148
Some basil.

20:33.858 --> 20:34.941
And salad dressing,
l think.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.067
Salad dressing?

20:36.152 --> 20:37.903
Yeah, it's a Caprese salad.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.988
There's a little bit of
mozzarella right there.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.032
Are you kidding me?

20:43.034 --> 20:44.326
That's my salad.

20:44.452 --> 20:45.785
So wait a minute.
There's no drugs?

20:45.870 --> 20:46.870
POLlCEMAN: No.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.747
Oh, damn it. Come on !

20:48.831 --> 20:50.790
We got a fake tip.

20:50.875 --> 20:51.875
Wait, officers,
are you sure you

20:51.959 --> 20:53.251
don't want to
interrogate him?

20:53.336 --> 20:55.086
POLlCEMAN: No.
You have laws
that protect you

20:55.171 --> 20:56.671
in any kind
of interrogation.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.506
Why don't you use them?

21:01.135 --> 21:03.553
You must feel pretty good
about yourself right now.

21:03.638 --> 21:08.016
l didn't put Caprese salad
in my drawer, Michael.
Did you?

21:08.100 --> 21:12.312
Since when is it illegal
to put Caprese salad
anywhere?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.315
You know, the police
could have been out there,

21:15.399 --> 21:17.817
catching real criminals,
instead of here,
searching my stuff.

21:17.902 --> 21:19.361
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.112
That's what
you're worried about?

21:21.197 --> 21:23.782
You're worried
about the cops' time.

21:23.866 --> 21:27.619
You think l framed you
and you're worried
about the taxpayer?

21:28.913 --> 21:30.205
God !

21:34.210 --> 21:36.503
Welcome back,
jerky jerk-face.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.925
You said you were leaving,
and you made liars
out of all of us.

21:42.009 --> 21:42.968
l did leave.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.135
Yes, you did.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.428
And then you came back.

21:45.513 --> 21:48.765
Which makes you
the biggest liar
of history.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.308
l don't see it
that way.

21:52.603 --> 21:53.687
Do you want to
hear a lie?

21:53.771 --> 21:54.771
What?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.189
l think you're great.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.149
You're my best friend.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.572
Hey, do you mind
if we make a stop
on the way home?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.074
Sure.
Cool.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.705
What are we doing at
your parents' house?

22:11.789 --> 22:13.540
l have a surprise for you.

22:13.624 --> 22:15.917
All right. Ready?
Close your eyes.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.587
And now, open your eyes.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.756
Ta-da!

22:23.592 --> 22:25.927
l don't get it.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.137
l bought it.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.306
lt's ours.

22:33.644 --> 22:36.563
Let's go inside.
l'll show you inside.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.567
So if you can believe it,
l did it without a realtor.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.862
Saving on
closing costs
is good.

22:43.946 --> 22:47.782
And we can put
all the money
to de-shag the carpet.

22:49.452 --> 22:53.246
Which l think will
help the color situation.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.460
Yeah,
l am really sorry
about this.

22:58.544 --> 23:02.047
l tried to move it,
but he is really
nailed in there.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.591
Worried about
art theft, l guess.

23:04.675 --> 23:07.135
A lot of art thieves
in this neighborhood.

23:09.638 --> 23:15.226
This is the master bedroom,
but l'm actually
not allowed in here.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.104
So, l'm still in the process
of converting the garage.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.106
lt's got great light
in here.

23:20.191 --> 23:25.153
And l was thinking
it could be perfect
for an art studio.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.416
Look, l know.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.043
l bought this
without asking you.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.838
And it doesn't look great.
l know that.

23:44.673 --> 23:48.343
And if you really hate it,
l totally understand.
lt's just. . .

23:48.427 --> 23:49.761
l love it.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.931
You do?

23:53.015 --> 23:55.141
Yeah, l love it.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.226
Really?

23:56.310 --> 23:57.769
l mean,
you bought me a house.

23:57.853 --> 23:58.937
Oh, my God.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.605
You bought me a house!

24:01.732 --> 24:03.149
Yeah, l did.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.577
Do we have to sleep
in your parents' bedroom?

24:14.662 --> 24:17.789
No. No, we'll just
board that up.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.334
lt'll be that
weird spare room
that people ask us about.

24:21.418 --> 24:22.544
And the clown?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.879
Yeah, l really
can't move him.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.800
What is my perfect crime?

24:28.884 --> 24:31.136
l break into Tiffany's
at midnight.

24:31.220 --> 24:35.056
Do l go for the vault?
No, l go for the chandelier.
lt's priceless.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.308
As l'm taking it down,
a woman catches me.

24:37.393 --> 24:38.601
She tells me to stop.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.687
lt's her father's business.
She's Tiffany.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.106
l say no.
We make love all night.

24:43.190 --> 24:46.317
ln the morning, the cops come
and l escape
in one of their uniforms.

24:46.402 --> 24:47.819
l tell her to
meet me in Mexico,

24:47.903 --> 24:50.155
but l go to Canada.
l don't trust her.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.490
Besides, l like the cold.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.033
30 years later,
l get a postcard.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.661
l have a son and
he's the chief of police.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.663
This is where
the story gets interesting.

24:58.747 --> 25:02.500
l tell Tiffany
to meet me in Paris
by the Trocadero.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.169
She's been waiting
for me all these years.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.753
She's never
taken another lover.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.131
l don't care.
l don't show up.
l go to Berlin.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.925
That's where
l stashed the chandelier.
