00:02.756 --> 00:03.856
<i>I'm gonna see my little girl!</i>

00:03.858 --> 00:05.458
No!

00:05.460 --> 00:07.260
You're not gonna get away
with this, Frannie! You're not!

00:07.262 --> 00:09.195
You are not coming in. Christopher!
I'm... I'm...

00:09.197 --> 00:10.998
We've got an audience.
Better call for backup.

00:10.999 --> 00:12.832
12 David requesting 10-85.
No, no, not like this...

00:12.834 --> 00:15.468
No emergency. We have a crowd at this location.
I want you to listen to me.

00:15.470 --> 00:16.703
You're not gonna get away
with this, Frannie!

00:16.705 --> 00:17.804
You're not coming in!
You're not...

00:17.806 --> 00:19.539
Okay, okay.
All right, hey, hey! Excuse me.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.807
Excuse me. Calm down. What's
going on? What's the problem?

00:20.809 --> 00:22.141
I'm just trying
to see my daughter.

00:22.143 --> 00:23.843
He's trying
to take her away from me.

00:23.845 --> 00:25.545
No, I'm not!
You okay, Mommy? - Oh.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.513
Alex, Alex, come to Daddy.
Come to Daddy.

00:27.515 --> 00:28.815
Whoa. Whoa.
Come on, man.

00:28.817 --> 00:30.717
Do me a favor. Back up.
Okay, tell me your name.

00:30.719 --> 00:32.919
Christopher Collins.
I just want to talk to her.

00:32.921 --> 00:34.654
Okay, talk to me.
Do-do you live here?

00:34.656 --> 00:35.922
No, but I got rights.

00:37.525 --> 00:38.791
Who has legal custody
of this child?

00:38.793 --> 00:40.493
I do.

00:40.495 --> 00:41.628
That doesn't mean
you can keep her from me.

00:41.630 --> 00:42.829
She's my kid, too.
Okay.

00:42.831 --> 00:43.997
What do
we got?

00:43.999 --> 00:45.031
We got a domestic.

00:45.033 --> 00:46.099
Maybe you can get
Mr. Collins' side

00:46.101 --> 00:47.501
of the story, and
we'll talk to her.

00:47.835 --> 00:48.934
Hey, I didn't do anything wrong!

00:48.936 --> 00:50.169
We didn't
say you did.

00:50.171 --> 00:51.203
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:51.205 --> 00:52.304
We just want
to talk to you.

00:52.306 --> 00:55.341
Okay, how did this all
get started?

00:55.343 --> 00:57.176
It's no big deal, okay?

00:57.178 --> 00:58.244
We can work this
out ourselves.

00:58.246 --> 00:59.545
Get off me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:59.547 --> 01:00.746
Would you just get off?!
Hey, calm down!

01:00.748 --> 01:02.348
Hey, I didn't do anything

01:02.350 --> 01:04.382
wrong, man!
What the hell are you doing?!

01:04.385 --> 01:05.618
You're going in
for disorderly conduct.

01:05.620 --> 01:06.752
I didn't do anything!

01:06.754 --> 01:08.721
You're going in for
disorderly conduct.

01:08.723 --> 01:10.422
What the hell are you doing, man?!
They're hurting Daddy.

01:10.424 --> 01:12.024
It's okay. There is
no need for that. - Alex...

01:12.026 --> 01:13.492
Please. This is
a private matter.

01:13.494 --> 01:15.261
You made it a public matter

01:15.263 --> 01:17.229
when you brought it
out on the street.

01:19.066 --> 01:21.734
All you damn cops ever do
is make things worse.

01:28.575 --> 01:30.176
We respond, diffuse
the situation,

01:30.178 --> 01:32.144
and we're the bad guys?

01:32.146 --> 01:34.213
Domestics are like
a box of chocolates.

01:34.215 --> 01:36.248
You never know
what you're gonna get.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.517
Yeah, I just feel bad
for that little girl.

01:38.519 --> 01:40.986
Yeah, she didn't win the lottery
in the parent department.

01:40.988 --> 01:43.289
Yeah. Know how
that feels.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.658
Just got another letter
from my dad yesterday.

01:45.660 --> 01:48.227
He never gives up.
Here you go.

01:48.229 --> 01:50.329
Maybe you should
think about...

01:50.331 --> 01:52.364
writing him back.

01:52.366 --> 01:56.735
Trust me, that letter wouldn't
make it past the prison censors.

01:56.737 --> 01:58.837
I need some help back here!

02:07.414 --> 02:08.881
Call for a bus!
Hey, what the hell happened?

02:08.883 --> 02:10.583
He had to take a leak.

02:10.585 --> 02:12.117
I took his cuffs off,
next thing I know,

02:12.119 --> 02:13.185
he took a swing at me.

02:13.187 --> 02:14.253
Did he bang his head?

02:14.255 --> 02:15.621
I-I don't know.

02:15.623 --> 02:17.156
Maybe he's on something.
I finally got him to the ground.

02:17.158 --> 02:18.558
Then I realized
he wasn't breathing.

02:18.559 --> 02:20.793
Eddie, give me a time check.
Hey, Christopher, stay with me.

02:20.795 --> 02:22.795
Come on, breathe.
Christopher, breathe!

02:22.797 --> 02:24.697
Hey, stay with me.

02:24.699 --> 02:27.466
Breathe. Chris,
breathe, Chris.

02:27.468 --> 02:31.036
And put a rush
on that bus!

02:33.873 --> 02:36.041
Yeah. I got it.

02:36.043 --> 02:38.143
I want the UOR on my desk

02:38.145 --> 02:40.379
before end of tour.

02:40.381 --> 02:43.782
I understand,
and the M.E.'s cause of death

02:43.784 --> 02:45.017
as soon as they can.

02:45.019 --> 02:47.987
I'll expect
to hear from you, Dino.

02:47.989 --> 02:49.021
What?

02:49.023 --> 02:51.690
We got a death in custody.

02:51.692 --> 02:53.359
12th precinct.

02:53.361 --> 02:55.561
Christopher Collins, age 34.

02:55.563 --> 02:57.429
We're gonna have
to hold a press conference.

02:57.431 --> 02:58.631
I know that, Garrett.

02:58.633 --> 03:01.533
Comes with the job.

03:01.535 --> 03:03.302
That went surprisingly well.

03:03.304 --> 03:04.436
Not my first rodeo.

03:04.438 --> 03:06.171
You should learn to
take a compliment.

03:06.173 --> 03:07.306
I'll put that
on my bucket list.

03:07.308 --> 03:08.474
Commissioner?
As you were.

03:08.476 --> 03:09.708
This press conference
is over, folks.

03:09.710 --> 03:10.809
Thanks for your time.

03:10.811 --> 03:12.211
Will Officer Cutter
be suspended?

03:12.213 --> 03:13.912
Officer Cutter's been placed
on modified assignment

03:13.914 --> 03:15.948
while this incident
is investigated.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.449
But do you take it personally

03:17.451 --> 03:20.452
when a citizen in custody
loses his life on your watch?

03:20.454 --> 03:22.321
We stand proudly on
this department's record

03:22.323 --> 03:24.290
of treating the public with
professionalism and respect.

03:24.292 --> 03:26.191
Commissioner? Commissioner?
That said,

03:26.193 --> 03:27.559
any loss of life is tragic.

03:27.561 --> 03:29.662
Mr. Collins' death will be
fully investigated

03:29.664 --> 03:31.864
by this department and
the district attorney's office.

03:31.866 --> 03:33.232
What's your reaction
to the selection

03:33.234 --> 03:34.800
of your daughter, Erin Reagan,

03:34.802 --> 03:37.403
to lead the D.A.'s investigation
of this matter?

03:38.906 --> 03:40.572
I have no comment on that.

03:40.574 --> 03:41.840
What would you say to those

03:41.842 --> 03:43.776
who will call this a glaring
conflict of interest?

03:43.778 --> 03:45.944
My daughter is
an accomplished prosecutor.

03:45.946 --> 03:48.347
And you feel she could be
objective about this, even when

03:48.349 --> 03:50.282
her father's professional
reputation is at stake?

03:50.284 --> 03:52.818
That is a question
that should be addressed to her.

03:52.820 --> 03:53.619
Exactly.

03:53.621 --> 03:54.620
But since

03:54.622 --> 03:55.688
you so ridiculously asked me,

03:55.690 --> 03:57.122
of course I think
she can be objective.

03:57.124 --> 03:58.290
That's it, Helen.

03:58.292 --> 04:00.526
- One more question.
- Commissioner?

04:29.945 --> 04:33.715
Did you see Mr. Collins
resist the officers?

04:33.717 --> 04:35.717
He was upset.

04:35.719 --> 04:38.920
But Christopher wasn't
a violent person.

04:38.922 --> 04:42.757
I see that he was arrested
for assault three years ago?

04:42.759 --> 04:43.958
That wasn't his fault.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.761
Some drunk jerk
went after his brother in a bar,

04:46.763 --> 04:48.062
and Chris stepped in.

04:48.064 --> 04:49.664
I see.

04:49.666 --> 04:52.233
Since you're obviously looking
to blame the victim here,

04:52.235 --> 04:54.169
I'll save you some time.

04:54.171 --> 04:56.371
I've been busted twice
for possession.

04:58.407 --> 05:00.575
But I've been clean
for over a year.

05:00.577 --> 05:03.645
And you and Mr. Collins
have a daughter?

05:03.647 --> 05:05.680
Alex.

05:05.682 --> 05:06.981
She's seven.

05:06.983 --> 05:08.550
And you never married?

05:08.552 --> 05:10.752
What difference does that make?

05:10.754 --> 05:12.453
I'm not making any judgments.

05:12.455 --> 05:14.222
I'm just trying
to get the facts.

05:14.224 --> 05:15.657
The facts are,

05:15.659 --> 05:18.827
me and Christopher
were having an argument

05:18.829 --> 05:20.995
like people do.

05:20.997 --> 05:24.799
Next thing I know, he's getting
thrown into a cop car.

05:24.801 --> 05:28.536
Two hours later, I get
a phone call that he's dead.

05:32.341 --> 05:34.309
Did Mr. Collins have any...

05:34.311 --> 05:37.412
medical conditions--
asthma, heart problems?

05:37.414 --> 05:41.282
You think he had a heart attack?

05:41.284 --> 05:43.651
That crazy cop killed him.

05:48.624 --> 05:50.625
Did anybody see what happened?

05:50.627 --> 05:53.828
I have not interviewed
the officers yet,

05:53.830 --> 05:55.697
but apparently
there were no eyewitnesses

05:55.699 --> 05:57.365
to the actual incident.

05:57.367 --> 05:59.067
Well, there's a shock.

05:59.069 --> 06:02.570
A building full of cops,
and no one saw a damn thing?

06:02.572 --> 06:04.572
I understand that you're upset.

06:04.574 --> 06:05.840
If you just let

06:05.842 --> 06:07.742
the investigation
take its course,

06:07.744 --> 06:08.877
I assure you that...

06:08.879 --> 06:10.912
I've been in the system
before, okay?

06:10.914 --> 06:14.048
You guys work
with the cops every day.

06:15.551 --> 06:18.186
We both know
what's gonna happen here.

06:36.038 --> 06:38.806
How you holding up?

06:40.342 --> 06:42.510
Had better days.

06:44.847 --> 06:46.848
Talk to IAB?

06:46.850 --> 06:48.816
Not yet.

06:48.818 --> 06:51.019
Guy came at me, Jamie.

06:51.021 --> 06:52.420
The hell was I supposed to do?

06:52.422 --> 06:54.589
Thing is, I'm getting
interviewed, so...

06:54.591 --> 06:56.491
can't talk about it.

06:56.493 --> 06:58.459
Yeah. I get it.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.662
You hang in there.

07:02.031 --> 07:03.298
You know, my old man...

07:04.400 --> 07:07.268
...thought I was crazy
when I took this job.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.371
Said it was crazy

07:10.373 --> 07:12.840
to put your life
on the line for peanuts.

07:13.676 --> 07:16.044
Might not be wrong.

07:37.099 --> 07:39.667
Looks like this
is gonna get ugly.

07:39.669 --> 07:41.536
Yeah, I could use a beer.

07:41.538 --> 07:42.837
Just one?

07:42.839 --> 07:44.439
Doubtful. You in?

07:44.441 --> 07:46.207
Oh, yeah.

07:46.209 --> 07:48.676
Randy Cutter is
pretty shaken up.

07:48.678 --> 07:51.179
Yeah. I've only talked
to him a couple times,

07:51.181 --> 07:53.081
but everybody says
he's a really good cop.

07:53.083 --> 07:55.516
Could have happened
to any of us in that bathroom.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.352
Don't remind me.

07:57.354 --> 07:59.153
I saw your dad.

07:59.155 --> 08:01.656
His press conference
on the news.

08:01.658 --> 08:03.658
He's in a tough spot.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.126
He's used to it.

08:05.128 --> 08:07.295
Crisis management's
a family tradition.

08:07.297 --> 08:10.298
It was cool the way
he stood up for your sister.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.033
Yeah, that reporter
got off easy.

08:12.035 --> 08:14.469
When it comes to sticking up
for his kids,

08:14.471 --> 08:16.137
my old man doesn't
take prisoners.

08:16.139 --> 08:19.640
Must be nice to know
you can count on him.

08:21.711 --> 08:22.910
Murderer!

08:25.781 --> 08:28.316
Erin's here, sir.

08:28.318 --> 08:32.120
Oh. Thank you, Baker. Hey.

08:32.121 --> 08:33.354
Hi. I hope you're ready.

08:33.356 --> 08:34.789
The reservation's at 7:30...
Oh, I canceled them.

08:34.791 --> 08:35.857
Oh. Why?

08:35.859 --> 08:38.326
Well, I thought we
could have dinner here.

08:39.595 --> 08:41.763
Oh. Okay.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.232
Look, I called an audible.

08:44.234 --> 08:45.700
I don't think
it's a good idea

08:45.702 --> 08:47.869
for you and me
to be out on the town.

08:47.871 --> 08:50.538
You had nothing to do

08:50.540 --> 08:52.607
with me being assigned
to this case.

08:52.609 --> 08:54.575
I know, but...

08:54.577 --> 08:56.944
sometimes the appearance
of a conflict can be worse

08:56.946 --> 08:58.312
than the real thing.

08:58.314 --> 09:00.548
So, we're just gonna
hide out up here?

09:00.550 --> 09:01.849
No. We're having dinner in.

09:01.851 --> 09:04.652
Okay by me.

09:10.493 --> 09:13.094
I... will say

09:13.096 --> 09:17.298
that finding out from a couple
of reporters was not ideal.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.468
Yeah, I'm sorry about that, but
things were moving so fast.

09:20.470 --> 09:23.071
Not like I haven't handled an
officer-involved case before.

09:23.073 --> 09:25.873
Death in custody is
a whole different deal.

09:25.875 --> 09:28.910
I understand.
I don't think you do.

09:28.912 --> 09:32.313
See, the other guy
on trial here is me.

09:32.315 --> 09:34.415
That's how this plays out.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.819
With you in the middle...

09:37.821 --> 09:40.922
Are you saying I should have
gotten your permission

09:40.924 --> 09:42.490
before taking this case?

09:42.492 --> 09:44.559
I'm just saying...

09:44.561 --> 09:47.028
that your participation
complicates

09:47.030 --> 09:49.130
an already difficult situation.

09:49.132 --> 09:52.467
Yeah, and have you thought
that it works both ways?

09:52.469 --> 09:55.703
Having you as a PC hasn't
made it exactly easy for me.

09:55.705 --> 09:57.672
I know that.

09:57.674 --> 09:59.974
But there are any number
of prosecutors

09:59.976 --> 10:01.843
who could have handled
this case,

10:01.845 --> 10:03.845
and there is only one PC.

10:03.847 --> 10:07.281
Yeah, and the fact
that he is my father

10:07.283 --> 10:10.118
isn't gonna stop me
from doing my job!

10:13.021 --> 10:16.858
Thank you for your support
with the reporters today.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.459
Excuse me.

10:18.461 --> 10:21.362
Don't think I'm gonna be very
good company for dinner tonight.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.811
<i>Officer Cutter was on the job</i>

10:36.813 --> 10:38.813
in Nassau County for six years.

10:38.815 --> 10:41.015
According to his evaluations,
Cutter was a model cop.

10:41.017 --> 10:43.584
Yeah, and he and his partner
did volunteer

10:43.586 --> 10:45.052
to be interviewed
this afternoon.

10:45.054 --> 10:47.088
Nice digs.

10:47.090 --> 10:48.523
Craig,

10:48.525 --> 10:50.558
I didn't know they let you out
of the M.E.'s office.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.394
Every now and then,
we walk among the living.

10:53.396 --> 10:55.496
You got a second for me?

10:55.498 --> 10:57.431
Yeah, sure. Richard.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.604
I got the preliminary findings

11:03.606 --> 11:05.573
on Christopher Collins'
cause of death.

11:05.575 --> 11:07.376
Well, you could have
just e-mailed that to me.

11:07.377 --> 11:08.709
Eh, for you I schlep,

11:08.711 --> 11:11.679
especially since the case
is all over the front page.

11:11.681 --> 11:15.183
Did the tox screen come back
with drugs in Collins' system?

11:15.185 --> 11:17.652
Nope. Clean as a whistle.

11:17.654 --> 11:19.654
Hmm.

11:19.656 --> 11:21.489
Nice.

11:21.491 --> 11:24.091
They don't have a picture of
this from the top of the bridge?

11:24.093 --> 11:25.893
Craig. Cause of death.

11:25.895 --> 11:28.896
Oh, yeah. Anoxic brain injury.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.866
Does that come in English?

11:31.868 --> 11:34.802
Christopher Collins sustained
pressure to the carotid artery--

11:34.804 --> 11:38.839
cuts off oxygen to the brain,
resulting in respiratory arrest.

11:38.841 --> 11:41.709
Are you saying Collins
was choked to death?

11:41.711 --> 11:44.946
Yep. You got an old-fashioned
homicide on your hands.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.856
I advised Officer Cutter. He has
no obligation to talk to you.

11:58.857 --> 12:01.491
I-I know you got a job to do,
and I got nothing to hide.

12:01.493 --> 12:04.127
Can you take me
through the incident?

12:04.129 --> 12:07.530
My partner and I brought the
suspect into the precinct.

12:07.532 --> 12:10.633
We stopped at the front desk,
I secured my weapon.

12:10.635 --> 12:13.236
Then, on the way
to the cell area,

12:13.238 --> 12:15.271
he says he needs
to use the bathroom.

12:15.273 --> 12:17.207
Was Collins handcuffed
at this point?

12:17.209 --> 12:19.442
Yes. But once we got inside,

12:19.444 --> 12:22.245
I took 'em off
so he could relieve himself.

12:22.247 --> 12:25.949
<i>Everything was fine till I</i>
<i>tried to put the cuffs back on.</i>

12:25.951 --> 12:27.450
<i>What happened?</i>

12:27.452 --> 12:29.119
<i>I got one of the cuffs on,</i>

12:29.121 --> 12:31.087
<i>and he complains</i>
<i>it's too tight.</i>

12:31.089 --> 12:34.891
<i>He starts resisting.</i>
<i>The guy's strong as an ox.</i>

12:34.893 --> 12:36.793
<i>Next thing I know,</i>
<i>we're going at it.</i>

12:36.795 --> 12:38.228
Did you call for help?

12:38.230 --> 12:40.296
I tried. He had his hands

12:40.298 --> 12:42.432
<i>in my face, on my throat.</i>

12:42.434 --> 12:45.602
Did you have your hands
on his throat at any point?

12:45.604 --> 12:50.073
Choke holds are
against department policy.

12:50.075 --> 12:51.941
Was that a no?

12:51.943 --> 12:53.243
Yeah.

12:53.245 --> 12:54.911
Uh,

12:54.913 --> 12:58.214
when I finally got control
of him, I called for my partner.

12:58.216 --> 13:00.150
That's when I...

13:00.152 --> 13:03.486
noticed Collins was unconscious.

13:04.255 --> 13:07.357
At first I thought
he was faking.

13:07.359 --> 13:09.025
You know?

13:09.027 --> 13:11.027
And...

13:11.029 --> 13:14.397
then I realized
he wasn't breathing.

13:18.435 --> 13:22.639
Look, I'm... sick
about what happened, Ms. Reagan.

13:23.474 --> 13:25.041
But if I didn't defend myself,

13:25.043 --> 13:29.379
it would have been me dead
in that bathroom.

13:29.381 --> 13:33.383
And where were you
when the incident occurred?

13:33.385 --> 13:35.752
I went down the hall to run
the prisoner for warrants

13:35.754 --> 13:38.454
while Officer Cutter
took him to the bathroom.

13:38.456 --> 13:41.391
And when were you aware
that there was something wrong?

13:41.393 --> 13:44.327
Uh, a couple minutes
after we split,

13:44.329 --> 13:45.762
I heard Randy...

13:45.764 --> 13:48.965
Officer Cutter, uh,
call for help.

13:48.967 --> 13:52.268
I ran down the hallway.
When I entered the bathroom,

13:52.270 --> 13:56.973
I saw Cutter on the floor with
the perp, who was unconscious.

13:58.742 --> 14:01.611
At any point,
did you see Officer Cutter...

14:01.613 --> 14:06.349
apply any kind of choke hold
on Mr. Collins?

14:06.351 --> 14:09.152
No.

14:09.154 --> 14:11.854
No, I didn't see anything
like that.

14:15.526 --> 14:18.094
Sarge is looking for volunteers
to take an inmate back to prison

14:18.096 --> 14:20.697
after he testifies downtown.
Sure.

14:20.699 --> 14:22.332
Thanks, boss.
You got it, Reagan.

14:22.334 --> 14:24.567
Uh, which prison?

14:24.569 --> 14:27.637
I think he's from
Lincoln Correctional.

14:27.639 --> 14:29.639
What?

14:34.578 --> 14:36.879
Would you cut the crap?
Hmm?

14:36.881 --> 14:38.881
You know my dad's
locked up over there.

14:38.883 --> 14:40.283
Yeah, I remember
you told me that.

14:40.285 --> 14:42.051
I know what you're trying to do.

14:42.053 --> 14:43.820
I know you think you're helping.

14:43.822 --> 14:44.988
You're not.

14:44.990 --> 14:46.956
Look, you have to talk to him
at some point.

14:46.958 --> 14:50.360
No. I don't think that I need
to talk to him at some point.

14:51.562 --> 14:54.163
It's not gonna be
a tearful reunion, okay?

14:54.165 --> 14:56.499
Not everyone comes
from a perfect family, Reagan.

14:56.501 --> 14:58.468
Hey, trust me,
we have our moments.

14:58.470 --> 15:00.203
You ever been betrayed
by the person

15:00.205 --> 15:02.672
you trust most in the world?

15:03.507 --> 15:04.774
You ever find out
that everything

15:04.776 --> 15:07.210
you grew up believing was a lie?

15:07.212 --> 15:08.544
No.

15:08.546 --> 15:10.013
You know what?

15:10.015 --> 15:13.182
If I need someone to fix my
life, I'm gonna call a shrink,

15:13.184 --> 15:15.118
not a cop.

15:20.324 --> 15:21.891
<i>You're saying</i>

15:21.893 --> 15:24.894
that cop strangled Christopher?

15:24.896 --> 15:27.130
His death has been ruled
a homicide.

15:27.132 --> 15:30.366
However, it's still unclear
if Officer Cutter's use of force

15:30.368 --> 15:32.368
was... justified.

15:32.370 --> 15:34.203
Meaning he could still get away
with it.

15:34.205 --> 15:36.105
Mommy?

15:36.107 --> 15:37.740
Can I bring Gus?

15:37.742 --> 15:39.242
Of course.

15:40.077 --> 15:42.412
Say hi
to Ms. Reagan.

15:42.414 --> 15:43.780
Hi.

15:43.782 --> 15:46.082
Hi. I like your elephant.

15:46.084 --> 15:48.284
Thank you.

15:50.454 --> 15:52.255
She's beautiful.

15:52.257 --> 15:54.223
Takes after
her father.

15:54.225 --> 15:56.426
Chris, uh...

15:56.428 --> 15:58.895
was, um...

15:58.897 --> 16:00.363
a good person.

16:00.365 --> 16:02.799
He wanted to get married. I...

16:02.801 --> 16:05.768
I could never get
my act together.

16:05.770 --> 16:08.404
What were you two arguing about
the day he died?

16:08.406 --> 16:12.642
I told him I want to take Alex
to live in Chicago.

16:12.644 --> 16:14.777
That's where my family's from.

16:14.779 --> 16:17.113
So he was upset
you were leaving?

16:17.115 --> 16:19.382
Alex was everything

16:19.384 --> 16:21.584
to him.

16:21.586 --> 16:24.787
I hate to admit it,
but he was a...

16:24.789 --> 16:27.056
he was a much better parent
than me.

16:27.058 --> 16:29.959
So when the police came

16:29.961 --> 16:32.195
and tried to take him away,
he...

16:32.197 --> 16:34.530
I guess he panicked.

16:34.532 --> 16:37.734
The thought of being far
from Alex, it...

16:37.736 --> 16:40.670
just... made him crazy.

16:42.272 --> 16:44.841
And Christopher shouldn't
have acted up with that cop,

16:44.843 --> 16:47.043
but...

16:48.812 --> 16:52.181
...he didn't deserve to die
for loving his little girl.

16:57.921 --> 17:00.496
Look at this
welcoming committee.

17:00.497 --> 17:03.432
Thanks for coming in, Norm.
Oh. Yeah, anything for my old boss.

17:03.434 --> 17:05.166
How's Long Island treating you?
Eh, good.

17:05.169 --> 17:07.269
I get a lot more fishing in
than when I worked for you.

17:07.271 --> 17:09.137
How you doing?
Hi, Chief, how are you?

17:09.138 --> 17:12.007
Baker, I need a few minutes
undisturbed with the chief.

17:12.009 --> 17:14.209
Yes, sir.

17:15.044 --> 17:16.978
Take a load off.
Mm-hmm.

17:16.980 --> 17:19.748
You still got that
old Boston Whaler?

17:19.750 --> 17:22.517
Yep. Just put
a brand-new cooler in.

17:22.519 --> 17:26.387
I like a man who's got
his priorities straight.

17:28.691 --> 17:30.725
I wanted to talk to you
about Randy Cutter.

17:30.727 --> 17:33.795
I figured that.
It's a hell of a situation.

17:33.797 --> 17:36.465
He was under your command for
six years. What can you tell me?

17:36.467 --> 17:40.068
Randy had a solid reputation.
Evaluations were excellent.

17:40.070 --> 17:43.338
He certainly was
on the fast track to detective.

17:43.340 --> 17:44.372
Why'd he leave?

17:44.374 --> 17:46.374
Eh, a lot of guys out there, uh,

17:46.376 --> 17:49.010
they think that the NYPD's
top of the line.

17:49.012 --> 17:51.213
You guys pay more.

17:51.215 --> 17:52.948
Eh, I guess he wanted
to know what it was like

17:52.950 --> 17:55.050
to work in the big city.

17:55.052 --> 17:57.018
Well...

17:57.020 --> 17:59.688
now he knows.

18:13.136 --> 18:16.071
Kara, thank you for meeting me.

18:16.073 --> 18:18.073
My lawyer told me not
to talk to you again.

18:18.075 --> 18:20.876
And yet here you are.

18:26.916 --> 18:30.585
I met Christopher Collins'
daughter today.

18:31.888 --> 18:33.488
How's she doing?

18:33.490 --> 18:35.423
It's tough.

18:35.425 --> 18:38.326
Her father was everything
to her.

18:40.163 --> 18:43.932
When you and Officer Cutter
had arrived on the scene,

18:43.934 --> 18:46.234
Collins had just learned
that his...

18:46.236 --> 18:49.538
ex was moving their daughter
to Chicago.

18:52.441 --> 18:54.209
You have kids?

18:54.211 --> 18:56.244
Yeah. My son's three-and-a-half.

18:56.246 --> 18:59.281
So you can imagine
how he was feeling.

19:00.383 --> 19:03.118
That didn't give him the right
to resist arrest.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.253
Or attack a cop.

19:05.255 --> 19:06.888
No.

19:06.890 --> 19:09.191
But I don't think
he deserved to die

19:09.193 --> 19:11.426
for trying to keep
his family together.

19:14.063 --> 19:16.431
When you've been a prosecutor
for a while,

19:16.433 --> 19:19.100
you kind of get a sense when...

19:19.102 --> 19:21.236
someone isn't telling you
everything they know.

19:21.238 --> 19:22.404
I should go.

19:22.406 --> 19:24.573
Did you see Officer Cutter

19:24.575 --> 19:27.776
apply a choke hold to Collins
in that bathroom?

19:29.212 --> 19:31.046
I've been riding with Randy
for over a year.

19:31.048 --> 19:33.215
He's the best cop I know,
and he saved my life

19:33.217 --> 19:35.217
on more than one occasion
so I can go home to my kid.

19:35.219 --> 19:37.485
So, in other words,
you're willing to lie for him.

19:37.487 --> 19:38.920
Because when
I call you

19:38.922 --> 19:41.323
in front of that grand jury,
you will be under oath.

19:41.325 --> 19:43.758
If you lie, it is a felony.

19:45.761 --> 19:47.229
You do what you gotta do,

19:47.231 --> 19:48.763
and I'll do the same.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.688
This corned beef
is amazing, Grandpa.

20:12.690 --> 20:14.823
Old family recipe.

20:14.825 --> 20:16.525
Which your great-grandmother

20:16.527 --> 20:17.993
guarded with her life.

20:17.995 --> 20:19.561
Why was it such a big secret?

20:19.563 --> 20:21.630
Grandma always
said a family is

20:21.632 --> 20:22.964
held together by
its secrets.

20:22.966 --> 20:25.267
We're held together by
corned beef and cabbage?

20:25.269 --> 20:26.468
Well...

20:26.470 --> 20:27.436
Yeah, and tradition.

20:27.438 --> 20:28.770
Things that are passed on

20:28.772 --> 20:30.772
from generation to generation.

20:30.774 --> 20:33.141
Sounds like the NYPD.

20:33.143 --> 20:34.609
How's that?

20:34.611 --> 20:36.545
Well, the department's
like family,

20:36.547 --> 20:38.847
and God knows they're good
at keeping secrets.

20:39.782 --> 20:41.016
What are we talking about?

20:41.018 --> 20:43.719
Everyone at this table
knows about

20:43.721 --> 20:46.521
the NYPD's blue wall of silence.

20:47.558 --> 20:49.291
Not me.

20:49.293 --> 20:51.360
It's when cops protect each other,
no matter what.

20:51.362 --> 20:52.661
It's more than that.

20:52.663 --> 20:54.596
Yeah, like when a skel
tries to slug you

20:54.598 --> 20:55.897
in the precinct bathroom,

20:55.899 --> 20:57.966
whatever they get in return
for that, they deserve.

20:57.968 --> 20:59.000
Exactly.

20:59.002 --> 21:00.168
And if the only witness to that

21:00.170 --> 21:01.103
is another cop,

21:01.105 --> 21:03.004
then he has nothing
to worry about.

21:03.006 --> 21:04.373
Oh, come on.

21:04.375 --> 21:07.075
I assume you're
referring to Officer Walsh.

21:07.077 --> 21:08.343
Kara's a good cop,

21:08.345 --> 21:09.945
and it's possible
she didn't see anything.

21:09.947 --> 21:12.447
You're toeing the company line
now, too, huh?

21:12.449 --> 21:13.415
What's that supposed to mean?

21:13.417 --> 21:14.916
It means that
your sister

21:14.918 --> 21:18.019
thinks that all cops lie
to cover each other's butts.

21:18.021 --> 21:19.154
Oh, she didn't say that.

21:19.156 --> 21:21.456
Okay, I get that cops
need to protect themselves,

21:21.458 --> 21:22.991
but there have to be
some regulations

21:22.993 --> 21:24.626
as to how far
they can go, right?

21:24.628 --> 21:26.828
- We have guidelines.
- That's right.

21:26.830 --> 21:28.497
To protect cops and the public.

21:28.499 --> 21:30.332
But no matter what the
regulations say, a cop

21:30.334 --> 21:32.868
should never rat
on their partner. Ever.

21:32.870 --> 21:36.004
So then the regulations
don't really mean much, right?

21:36.006 --> 21:37.773
Smart kid.

21:37.775 --> 21:39.508
What your father's saying
is that sometimes

21:39.510 --> 21:41.877
the most important thing
is personal loyalty.

21:41.879 --> 21:44.012
So husbands and wives
can't be forced to testify

21:44.014 --> 21:45.680
against each other
or their kids.

21:45.682 --> 21:46.915
That's a relief.

21:46.917 --> 21:49.017
Don't be getting
any bright ideas.

21:50.086 --> 21:51.086
That's fine,

21:51.088 --> 21:53.555
but Cutter and Walsh
are not family.

21:53.557 --> 21:54.756
They're partners.

21:54.758 --> 21:56.358
All right, but when you're
out on the street,

21:56.360 --> 21:58.894
the only person that can watch
your back is your partner.

21:58.896 --> 22:01.663
And your life is in their hands.
So I don't know about you,

22:01.665 --> 22:04.065
but that makes me feel
like it's a family.

22:04.067 --> 22:05.700
But the law...

22:05.702 --> 22:07.335
doesn't see it that way.

22:08.771 --> 22:10.038
Maybe it should.

22:17.513 --> 22:19.815
Why do we
have to leave so early?

22:19.817 --> 22:22.350
I have to work...
I just want to leave.

22:23.486 --> 22:24.953
Don't forget the dividends.

22:26.589 --> 22:28.423
Corned beef makes
good leftovers?

22:28.425 --> 22:29.791
Well, that's
the best thing about it.

22:29.793 --> 22:32.060
You chop it up with some
potatoes and some onions,

22:32.062 --> 22:34.896
you fry it up in a skillet, and
presto: corned beef hash.

22:39.168 --> 22:41.536
I'll take this
to the car.

22:42.805 --> 22:45.574
It sounds like you've
already made up your mind

22:45.576 --> 22:48.210
about asking for an indictment
against my officer.

22:48.212 --> 22:50.245
Your officer?

22:50.247 --> 22:51.379
That's the way I see 'em.

22:51.381 --> 22:54.416
I believe Randy Cutter is guilty

22:54.418 --> 22:56.618
of criminally negligent
homicide.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.553
And you have enough
to back that up?

22:58.555 --> 23:00.388
Honestly, no. I wish I had more.

23:00.390 --> 23:03.391
Well, I'm no lawyer,

23:03.393 --> 23:07.729
but it looks to me like the case
against him's pretty flimsy.

23:07.731 --> 23:08.763
Well, it wouldn't be

23:08.765 --> 23:10.665
if his partner would admit
to what she saw.

23:10.667 --> 23:13.602
Do you think it's fair to indict
a man for what you think is true

23:13.604 --> 23:14.970
rather than what you can prove?

23:14.972 --> 23:18.240
The point of the grand jury is
not to prove innocence or guilt.

23:18.242 --> 23:20.575
I just want to convince them
to let me try the case.

23:20.577 --> 23:21.877
I know the law.

23:21.879 --> 23:25.814
I also know Christopher Collins
attacked Officer Cutter,

23:25.816 --> 23:28.817
who was unarmed and outweighed
by a good 50 pounds.

23:28.819 --> 23:31.253
Christopher Collins
was unarmed, too,

23:31.255 --> 23:32.888
and "your officer" used
deadly force!

23:32.890 --> 23:36.925
If it were me or Danny or Jamie,
we might've done the same thing.

23:36.927 --> 23:39.528
I'm supposed to give Cutter
the benefit of the doubt?!

23:39.530 --> 23:41.796
The man was defending himself!

23:41.798 --> 23:45.033
Is that what the prosecutor
on the case is supposed to do,

23:45.035 --> 23:46.434
or the commissioner's daughter?

23:48.638 --> 23:52.307
You chose to make that
one and the same, Erin.

23:55.311 --> 23:58.146
Christopher Collins was a father

23:58.148 --> 23:59.948
who was facing
the loss of his daughter,

23:59.950 --> 24:03.184
and he was scared and confused
and likely out of line,

24:03.186 --> 24:05.253
but he did not deserve to die.

24:11.127 --> 24:13.995
You really trust your gut
on this?

24:13.997 --> 24:16.965
Yes.

24:16.967 --> 24:19.234
Officer Cutter went too far...

24:19.236 --> 24:21.503
and he needs to pay for it.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.421
I'm just saying
she's got a job to do.

24:39.423 --> 24:40.789
Dad doesn't?

24:40.791 --> 24:43.291
I saw him last night.
He is not happy.

24:43.293 --> 24:45.360
Why, what, did he say something?

24:45.362 --> 24:46.728
Didn't have to say anything.

24:46.730 --> 24:48.697
Erin's name came up
and he made that face.

24:48.699 --> 24:52.200
Was it the I've-got-the weight-of-the-world
on-my-shoulders face

24:52.202 --> 24:53.668
or the I-wish-
I-never-had-kids face?

24:53.670 --> 24:56.404
Both faces. And you know what?
He's right.

24:56.406 --> 24:57.806
She should've never taken
the case.

24:57.808 --> 24:59.174
Well, maybe nobody noticed,

24:59.176 --> 25:01.910
but Erin's a rising star
in the DA's office.

25:01.912 --> 25:03.812
She might become the first
female Manhattan DA.

25:03.814 --> 25:06.681
So what?
So, if her last name's Reagan,

25:06.683 --> 25:09.751
she's gotta prove she's independent of
the NYPD and the PC.

25:09.753 --> 25:11.286
All of our last names are Reagan

25:11.288 --> 25:13.188
and we all got careers
to worry about,

25:13.190 --> 25:14.623
but family comes first.

25:14.625 --> 25:16.291
How's it going, Jamie?

25:16.293 --> 25:17.859
Oh, hey, you guys.

25:17.861 --> 25:19.628
Uh, this is my brother, Danny.

25:19.630 --> 25:20.929
Hey.

25:20.931 --> 25:23.798
Word is your sister's going
pretty hard after Cutter.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.102
Can't talk about that.

25:27.104 --> 25:28.536
He's a good cop.

25:28.538 --> 25:30.105
She should cut
him some slack.

25:31.274 --> 25:33.942
Hey, how about I buy
the next round, okay,

25:33.944 --> 25:36.511
and you guys take it back
from where you came from?

25:36.513 --> 25:37.912
Cutter was doing his job.

25:37.914 --> 25:40.548
Your sister shouldn't sell him
out for a headline.

25:40.550 --> 25:42.384
And you should shut your face.

25:42.386 --> 25:44.452
I think you should take
my brother up on that beer.

25:47.490 --> 25:49.591
Or we could
just take this outside.

25:52.361 --> 25:55.630
Hey, come on.

25:55.632 --> 25:57.365
Let's go.

26:08.310 --> 26:09.811
Let me get this straight.

26:09.813 --> 26:11.880
You're ready to throw down
with those two knuckleheads

26:11.882 --> 26:12.947
even though they agree

26:12.949 --> 26:14.616
with everything
you just said about Erin?

26:14.618 --> 26:17.686
Reagan family rule number one:

26:17.688 --> 26:19.421
Reagans can talk smack
all night long.

26:19.423 --> 26:22.691
Outsiders talk smack,
there's gonna be a fight.

26:23.559 --> 26:26.494
Way to get my back.

26:26.496 --> 26:28.063
Glad to help.

26:30.599 --> 26:32.200
Hey, Frank.

26:32.202 --> 26:33.668
Morning, Norm.
I didn't think

26:33.670 --> 26:36.237
you'd take me up
on that fishing trip so soon.

26:36.239 --> 26:38.873
Yeah, well.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.942
I was thinking about
what you told me,

26:40.944 --> 26:44.779
about how Randy Cutter always
wanted to work for the NYPD.

26:44.781 --> 26:45.947
Yeah, yeah. What about it?

26:45.949 --> 26:49.284
Why did he wait six years
to make the move?

26:49.286 --> 26:50.952
You'd have to ask him that.

26:50.954 --> 26:52.754
I'm asking you.

26:53.823 --> 26:56.825
Why would a solid cop
like Cutter--

26:56.827 --> 26:58.426
close to making detective--

26:58.428 --> 27:01.930
suddenly turn in his shield,
forfeit his seniority

27:01.932 --> 27:04.599
and start from scratch
with another department?

27:07.737 --> 27:12.474
You know, I always considered us
colleagues.

27:12.476 --> 27:16.845
Friends, even,
in that "from work" kind of way.

27:16.847 --> 27:18.213
You?

27:18.215 --> 27:19.380
Yeah, sure.

27:19.382 --> 27:24.385
There was an allegation
that went away

27:24.387 --> 27:27.522
with a quick settlement
and a quiet resignation.

27:27.524 --> 27:30.191
How did you know?

27:33.629 --> 27:36.197
I didn't... till now.

27:36.199 --> 27:39.768
What I told you about Cutter's
reputation, that was all true.

27:39.770 --> 27:41.369
He was a good cop for us.

27:41.371 --> 27:43.772
But it wasn't the whole truth,
was it, Norm?

27:46.609 --> 27:48.710
Cutter and his partner collared
a couple of kids;

27:48.712 --> 27:50.845
possession of narcotics.
No weapons.

27:50.847 --> 27:54.883
One of 'em ran.
Cutter took off after him.

27:54.885 --> 27:57.852
When his partner caught up,
the kid had a fractured skull.

27:57.854 --> 28:00.455
I wanted him charged,

28:00.457 --> 28:02.190
I wanted him tossed
off the force,

28:02.192 --> 28:05.560
but the county executive,
he had other ideas.

28:05.562 --> 28:06.928
It was an election year...

28:06.930 --> 28:10.098
You let me hire
a ticking time bomb.

28:10.100 --> 28:13.334
I'm sorry, Frank.

28:13.336 --> 28:16.271
A day late
and a dollar short, Norm.

28:16.273 --> 28:18.773
This goes public,
I won't cover for you.

28:18.775 --> 28:20.842
You're on your own.

28:36.370 --> 28:40.573
I used to walk this beat
back in the day.

28:40.575 --> 28:42.909
As you were.

28:42.911 --> 28:44.677
You mind if I tag along?

28:44.679 --> 28:46.713
No, sir.

28:49.250 --> 28:51.851
Been quite a week.

28:51.853 --> 28:53.686
You doing okay?

28:53.688 --> 28:56.089
Just trying
to get through it, I guess.

28:56.091 --> 28:58.224
You do this job
on a razor's edge.

28:58.226 --> 29:01.094
You protect people,
keep the peace,

29:01.096 --> 29:03.696
and try to do it
the right way.

29:03.698 --> 29:07.467
Yes, sir.
That goes for me...

29:07.469 --> 29:08.535
and Randy.

29:08.537 --> 29:12.972
But sometimes,
despite your best efforts,

29:12.974 --> 29:14.441
things go wrong.

29:16.043 --> 29:17.744
With all due respect, sir,

29:17.746 --> 29:20.680
I already gave
my statement to IAB.

29:20.682 --> 29:22.615
I read your statement,
Officer Walsh.

29:22.617 --> 29:24.818
I'm not here to question it.

29:29.990 --> 29:32.959
Used to be a Polish market
on that corner.

29:34.495 --> 29:39.065
The stores change,
the faces change,

29:39.067 --> 29:43.169
but the job we do here...

29:43.171 --> 29:45.472
that stays the same.

29:45.474 --> 29:48.041
Serve and protect.

29:48.043 --> 29:50.243
The citizens and your partner.

29:50.245 --> 29:52.979
Randy always had my back.

29:52.981 --> 29:55.115
He made me a better cop.

29:55.117 --> 29:57.650
Then you owe him for that.

29:57.652 --> 30:00.920
But it does not excuse you
of the obligation

30:00.922 --> 30:02.088
to enforce the law.

30:02.090 --> 30:05.825
Collins attacked my partner
in that bathroom.

30:05.827 --> 30:07.794
Randy had the right
to defend himself.

30:07.796 --> 30:10.096
Yes, he did.

30:10.098 --> 30:13.933
But if he went too far,

30:13.935 --> 30:15.635
that's for a jury to decide.

30:18.072 --> 30:20.773
My uncle was a sergeant
in the 3-8 for 30 years.

30:20.775 --> 30:23.743
And he told me a cop who won't
put it all on the line

30:23.745 --> 30:25.845
for his partner doesn't
deserve to wear the shield.

30:25.847 --> 30:28.648
All due respect to your uncle,

30:28.650 --> 30:31.618
it's the cop who breaks the law

30:31.620 --> 30:34.053
doesn't deserve
to wear the shield.

30:56.243 --> 30:57.343
Hey...

30:57.345 --> 31:01.915
this thing with my dad
has been chewing at me

31:01.917 --> 31:03.983
for a-a long time.

31:05.319 --> 31:08.321
And I've tried everything
I can think of to get over it,

31:08.323 --> 31:09.322
but I just can't.

31:09.324 --> 31:11.658
I get that.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.126
He did a really bad thing.

31:13.128 --> 31:17.330
He ruined people's lives.

31:17.332 --> 31:19.365
He ruined my family.

31:19.367 --> 31:22.869
And he did a real job on you.

31:24.538 --> 31:26.439
Yeah. When you...

31:26.441 --> 31:29.776
when you believe in someone
completely

31:29.778 --> 31:32.979
and they let you down...

31:32.981 --> 31:36.916
it messes with you.

31:37.985 --> 31:40.820
You start to question
your own judgment,

31:40.822 --> 31:44.691
and it's like you...

31:44.693 --> 31:46.426
it's like I can't trust myself.

31:46.428 --> 31:48.595
It's like I can't trust anyone.

31:48.597 --> 31:51.264
That's no way to live, Eddie.

31:51.266 --> 31:52.809
I know.

31:55.770 --> 31:58.338
That's why...

31:58.340 --> 32:00.840
that's why today after tour,

32:00.842 --> 32:03.977
I'm gonna, um...

32:03.979 --> 32:06.646
I'm gonna go up there,
I'm gonna see my dad.

32:07.481 --> 32:09.549
Good for you.

32:09.551 --> 32:12.318
I-I know I don't have
the right to ask you this,

32:12.320 --> 32:15.989
but I just was wondering if...

32:15.991 --> 32:20.326
maybe you'd want
to go up there... with me?

32:21.729 --> 32:23.396
Yeah.

32:23.398 --> 32:26.132
I could do that.

32:33.674 --> 32:36.976
We'll start by presenting
the timeline, and then I'll go

32:36.978 --> 32:38.645
into the medical
examiner's report.

32:38.647 --> 32:40.513
I'll have the slides
ready to go.

32:40.515 --> 32:42.148
Great. And...

32:43.017 --> 32:45.451
Can I talk to you for a second?

32:45.453 --> 32:46.753
Yeah.

32:46.755 --> 32:48.454
I'll meet you inside.

32:51.759 --> 32:53.760
I owe you an apology.

32:53.762 --> 32:56.696
No. No, you don't
owe me anything.

32:56.698 --> 32:59.732
Except the truth.

32:59.734 --> 33:01.668
You were right.

33:01.670 --> 33:04.170
I didn't tell you
everything I saw.

33:04.172 --> 33:05.638
I couldn't.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.774
I know it's difficult.

33:11.179 --> 33:14.047
When I heard Cutter
call for help,

33:14.049 --> 33:15.148
I ran to the bathroom.

33:15.150 --> 33:18.217
<i>I saw Cutter and Collins</i>
<i>on the floor.</i>

33:18.219 --> 33:20.920
<i>Cutter had Collins</i>
<i>around the neck.</i>

33:20.922 --> 33:21.821
<i>Collins was turning blue.</i>

33:21.823 --> 33:24.123
Randy, let him go.

33:24.125 --> 33:25.858
Randy.
<i>I told Randy to let him go.</i>

33:25.860 --> 33:27.560
Get help.
<i>But he didn't.</i>

33:27.562 --> 33:29.462
<i>I mean, his motor</i>
<i>was going pretty good,</i>

33:29.464 --> 33:30.830
<i>he was just locked in.</i>

33:30.832 --> 33:32.065
Go for help!

33:32.067 --> 33:34.067
<i>And he told me to go get help.</i>

33:37.806 --> 33:41.040
I should have stayed.

33:41.042 --> 33:42.508
Maybe I could have stopped it.

33:42.510 --> 33:46.312
No. What happened
is not your fault.

33:48.049 --> 33:50.216
By the time I came back
with help,

33:50.218 --> 33:53.886
Randy was giving him CPR, but...

33:53.888 --> 33:55.488
by then it was too late.

33:59.694 --> 34:02.295
It takes a lot of courage
to tell the truth.

34:04.865 --> 34:07.033
Better late than never, I guess.

34:10.170 --> 34:12.605
He didn't mean
to kill him, Ms. Reagan.

34:13.974 --> 34:15.574
He just went too far.

34:20.215 --> 34:21.848
You okay to go inside?

34:40.434 --> 34:42.101
Eddie, you all right?

34:42.103 --> 34:45.772
Starting to think that maybe
this wasn't such a hot idea.

34:45.774 --> 34:47.340
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

34:47.342 --> 34:49.108
Yeah, really?
Well, maybe you should go in,

34:49.110 --> 34:50.409
'cause I'm gonna
go back to the car.

34:50.411 --> 34:52.712
Hey. Hey. Eddie. Eddie.

34:52.714 --> 34:54.813
You're doing
the right thing here.

34:54.815 --> 34:57.483
It's just crazy.

34:57.485 --> 34:59.285
He's...
You know, he's my father,

34:59.287 --> 35:02.088
and I have absolutely no idea
what to say to him.

35:02.090 --> 35:03.589
I think he
just wants to see you.

35:03.591 --> 35:06.793
No. I think he wants me
to forgive him.

35:06.795 --> 35:08.594
And I don't know
that I can do that.

35:08.596 --> 35:11.030
You know, when we first started
working together,

35:11.032 --> 35:12.899
I got to admit,
I had my doubts about you.

35:12.901 --> 35:15.501
Say what?
Rich girl from the suburbs,

35:15.503 --> 35:16.869
fancy car, four feet tall,

35:16.871 --> 35:18.171
wiseass attitude.

35:18.173 --> 35:19.939
Oh. Like you're God's gift
to the NYPD?

35:19.941 --> 35:22.542
Then we got in a couple
tough spots together,

35:22.544 --> 35:24.010
and you know what?

35:24.012 --> 35:25.278
You really showed me something.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.279
Yeah.

35:26.281 --> 35:27.580
What?

35:27.582 --> 35:30.917
No matter what goes down,
you never take a step back.

35:30.919 --> 35:31.951
You're not afraid, Eddie.

35:31.953 --> 35:36.622
Well, maybe I just
do a good job hiding it.

35:36.624 --> 35:38.958
Either way, you,
you do what you got to do.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.294
You can do this.

35:43.597 --> 35:45.965
What the hell?

35:45.967 --> 35:47.867
I left my gun back in my locker,

35:47.869 --> 35:49.402
so it's not like I'm gonna
shoot the guy.

35:49.404 --> 35:50.503
That's the spirit.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.607
Thank you.

35:54.609 --> 35:56.042
Yep.

36:05.819 --> 36:08.387
Sir.

36:11.693 --> 36:14.427
Officer Cutter's here.

36:14.429 --> 36:15.795
Let's have him.

36:23.271 --> 36:25.738
Thanks for coming in.
Please sit down.

36:25.740 --> 36:28.107
Commissioner.

36:29.544 --> 36:31.577
I understand you started a fund

36:31.579 --> 36:33.312
for Christopher Collins'
daughter.

36:33.314 --> 36:34.247
Thank you.

36:34.249 --> 36:37.049
The least I could do.

36:37.051 --> 36:39.185
If-if I could take back
what happened...

36:41.455 --> 36:42.922
I know.

36:44.259 --> 36:45.791
How do you think
the grand jury went?

36:45.793 --> 36:47.493
Uh...

36:47.495 --> 36:50.196
my lawyers advised me
not to testify.

36:50.198 --> 36:51.264
I-I wanted to--

36:51.266 --> 36:53.699
wanted to tell them
what really happened.

36:55.035 --> 36:58.938
Well, looks like things are
working out for you.

36:58.940 --> 37:00.740
I just got a heads up.

37:00.742 --> 37:02.975
The grand jury declined
to indict you.

37:07.448 --> 37:09.048
Thank you, sir.

37:09.050 --> 37:12.852
They say a grand jury will
indict a ham sandwich, but...

37:12.854 --> 37:14.754
when a police officer acts

37:14.756 --> 37:15.888
in the line of duty,

37:15.890 --> 37:17.990
suddenly they seem
to lose their appetite.

37:17.992 --> 37:19.992
Well, I-I'm just...

37:19.994 --> 37:21.961
grateful I can get back to work.

37:23.997 --> 37:25.431
Not here.

37:25.433 --> 37:27.099
Sir?

37:27.101 --> 37:31.771
Oh. I'm sure there are PDs that
would consider you an asset.

37:31.773 --> 37:33.372
But not this one.

37:34.909 --> 37:36.342
Not while I'm
police commissioner.

37:36.344 --> 37:39.011
Uh-- I don't understand.

37:39.013 --> 37:41.480
I know what happened
out on Long Island.

37:41.482 --> 37:43.449
That was an accident, sir.

37:43.451 --> 37:44.550
The guy resisted arrest.

37:44.552 --> 37:47.053
Like Christopher Collins?

37:47.055 --> 37:50.990
You know, at a certain point,
it seems like it's your problem,

37:50.992 --> 37:52.491
not their problem.

37:52.493 --> 37:54.060
That's not fair.

37:54.062 --> 37:57.863
Well, it is my job to decide
whether two bad incidents

37:57.865 --> 38:00.533
in an otherwise stellar
seven-year career...

38:00.535 --> 38:04.036
make you... an unlucky cop...

38:04.038 --> 38:06.772
or a dangerous cop.

38:06.774 --> 38:09.075
And I have to err
on the side of caution here.

38:09.077 --> 38:12.244
Look, you walked a beat,
Commissioner.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.480
You know what it's like
when your life's on the line.

38:14.482 --> 38:16.649
We get paid to keep the peace

38:16.651 --> 38:18.150
with restraint
and good judgment,

38:18.152 --> 38:19.852
even...

38:19.854 --> 38:21.887
...when our lives
are on the line.

38:24.325 --> 38:26.058
Not everyone's built for it.

38:27.327 --> 38:29.261
You are not built for it.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.864
I defended myself.

38:31.866 --> 38:34.700
With a choke hold
that is clearly not authorized

38:34.702 --> 38:35.701
by this department.

38:35.703 --> 38:36.969
Look, you-you can't do this.

38:36.971 --> 38:38.738
All due respect, sir,
I want a hearing.

38:38.740 --> 38:40.106
You're still on probation.

38:40.108 --> 38:42.241
I can terminate you
anytime I choose.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.180
Randy...

38:48.182 --> 38:50.916
this job is not about
being strong enough

38:50.918 --> 38:52.785
to use force.

38:54.988 --> 38:57.189
It's about being
strong enough not to.

39:01.696 --> 39:02.895
I'm sorry.

39:04.332 --> 39:05.498
You're dismissed.

39:25.619 --> 39:27.219
Didn't mean to barge in.

39:27.221 --> 39:29.555
Well, security didn't call.

39:29.557 --> 39:31.023
You must have some juice.

39:31.025 --> 39:33.626
Most of the guys downstairs
used to work for me.

39:33.628 --> 39:37.363
Well, you cops
do stick together.

39:37.365 --> 39:40.199
I heard about the grand jury.

39:40.201 --> 39:44.670
Well, I thought I was home free
once Officer Walsh came forward.

39:44.672 --> 39:46.038
Thank you for that, by the way.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.540
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:47.542 --> 39:52.144
I also got an anonymous tip
that Cutter had

39:52.146 --> 39:54.313
cracked someone's skull open
in Long Island.

39:54.315 --> 39:56.182
I suppose you don't know
anything about that, either.

39:56.184 --> 39:57.083
Nope.

40:04.492 --> 40:05.791
Cutter wouldn't take the stand,

40:05.793 --> 40:08.494
so I didn't get his violent past
on the record.

40:08.496 --> 40:10.763
What about
Officer Walsh's testimony?

40:12.433 --> 40:13.966
It wasn't enough.

40:13.968 --> 40:15.868
At the end of the day,
the jurors just saw a cop

40:15.870 --> 40:17.903
defending himself
against a violent criminal.

40:17.905 --> 40:19.572
Started out that way.

40:19.574 --> 40:22.875
Yeah.

40:22.877 --> 40:24.677
I just wish Cutter
knew when to stop

40:24.679 --> 40:26.045
and I pray he doesn't
go out there

40:26.047 --> 40:27.012
and do it all over again.

40:27.014 --> 40:28.047
He won't.

40:29.383 --> 40:31.050
Not here, anyway.

40:35.388 --> 40:36.889
Hmm.

40:36.891 --> 40:39.225
What happened to, uh,

40:39.227 --> 40:41.060
giving him the
benefit of the doubt?

40:41.062 --> 40:42.128
In this case,

40:42.130 --> 40:44.230
it didn't benefit anybody
but him.

40:46.234 --> 40:49.301
Look at you, all wised up.

40:55.208 --> 40:58.911
When I found out you were
handling the case...

40:58.913 --> 41:00.513
I reacted badly.

41:01.882 --> 41:04.116
Well, I could have
given you a heads up.

41:04.118 --> 41:07.486
You were doing your job.

41:07.488 --> 41:10.055
I was only thinking of mine.

41:12.025 --> 41:14.627
I'm sorry.

41:19.332 --> 41:21.233
Thank you for that.

41:25.305 --> 41:27.573
I could use a drink.

41:27.575 --> 41:29.542
Join me?

41:35.615 --> 41:37.917
Isn't that some kind of
conflict of interest?

41:37.919 --> 41:40.519
Well, we could get
separate checks.
