WEBVTT

00:00.860 --> 00:02.168
Previously on The Good Wife:

00:02.200 --> 00:03.565
Glenn.
Peter.

00:03.600 --> 00:04.760
So, you're putting me in

00:04.800 --> 00:06.734
with the general
population, huh?
Yes.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.030
GOLDEN:
Miss Madison.

00:11.070 --> 00:12.071
Do you recognize
this man?

00:12.110 --> 00:13.338
Prior to your
relationship

00:13.380 --> 00:14.677
with my client, you had

00:14.710 --> 00:16.075
a similar relationship
with him.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.099
You wouldn't.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.572
To protect my family,

00:18.610 --> 00:21.408
you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.617
This is not about sex.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.356
Now let me repeat that
because it bares repeating.

00:29.390 --> 00:32.223
This is not... about sex.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.162
So, what is this really about?

00:36.200 --> 00:38.168
My client was convicted
and sentenced to prison

00:38.200 --> 00:39.792
for a very simple

00:39.840 --> 00:42.161
and almost prosaic reason.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.166
He told his subordinates to DP--

00:44.210 --> 00:46.838
decline to prosecute--
certain cases,

00:46.880 --> 00:49.769
and the prosecution believes
this was in trade

00:49.810 --> 00:52.415
for financial and sexual favors.

00:52.450 --> 00:54.748
That... is what
it comes down to.
(door opening)

00:54.780 --> 00:56.748
But the prosecution
has a problem.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.183
The evidence that they presented
at the trial

01:01.220 --> 01:03.586
was entirely circumstantial,
and to be granted

01:03.630 --> 01:06.827
a new trial, we don't even have
to disprove any of it.

01:06.860 --> 01:09.693
What we need to do,
what we intend to do,

01:09.730 --> 01:11.698
is to persuade Your Honor

01:11.730 --> 01:14.164
that if the jury
had heard the new evidence

01:14.200 --> 01:16.361
that you will hear
over the next two weeks,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.208
they likely would have reached
a different verdict.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.537
No, I'm all right.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.673
I'm just, uh, staying
for the opening arguments.

01:23.710 --> 01:24.779
How is it going?

01:24.810 --> 01:25.777
Good. They feel good.

01:25.810 --> 01:27.141
Good.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.374
The judge likes Peter.
He just needs

01:28.420 --> 01:30.217
to be given a reason
to decide for him.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.150
Aanay, sorry
to be loading up on you,

01:32.190 --> 01:34.351
but the client's going
to be here in an hour.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.755
What client?

01:35.790 --> 01:37.223
Colin Sweeney.

01:37.260 --> 01:38.056
Oh.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.354
I love the reaction
that name gets.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.766
It's like the horses
in Young Frankenstein.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.166
Are we really going
to represent him?

01:45.200 --> 01:46.758
We are really going
to represent him.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.303
And, luclq you,
you're now second chair.

01:49.340 --> 01:50.307
Luclq me.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.500
I'll see you in an hour.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.532
Clients are
going to bolt.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.502
Your clients.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.211
You mean the
bleeding heart feminists

01:59.250 --> 02:01.218
who don't pay the bills?

02:01.250 --> 02:01.875
Don't play that game.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.547
This isn't a feminist issue.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.182
Colin Sweeney killed his wife.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.552
Colin Sweeney was found
not guilty of killing his wife.

02:07.590 --> 02:08.852
So was 0.].
Yes, and...

02:08.890 --> 02:11.279
Why am I the one standing up

02:11.330 --> 02:12.888
_ for "innocent
until proven gunlty" here?

02:12.930 --> 02:14.227
Because you're not.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.693
You want his
company's busmess.

02:15.730 --> 02:16.867
Yes, as should you.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.164
We lost a _third
of our busmess

02:19.200 --> 02:20.462
with Stern
leaving the firm.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.264
We can't turn our noses up
at any clients these days.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.368
Because we know we're not making

02:24.410 --> 02:25.900
any money
from your pet causes.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.373
It's not a pet cause.

02:27.410 --> 02:28.877
It's not even a lawsuit yet.

02:28.910 --> 02:29.945
I'm just considering it.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.345
Come on._
You can't wm.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.870
You don't even want to win.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.740
You just want to harass
gun manufacturers.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.283
So, it's the Wild West, is it?

02:37.320 --> 02:39.311
Without Stern,
you have one vote,

02:42.730 --> 02:44.220
Looks like it.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.818
We're heading into a bad time.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.865
KALIN DA:
Revolvers,

02:51.900 --> 02:53.834
semiautomatics,
six-shot, eight-shot.

02:53.870 --> 02:55.428
CARY:
Wow.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.438
To win, we have to show
that the gun manufacturer

02:57.470 --> 02:58.459
knowingly violated
state law

02:58.510 --> 03:00.774
when they allowed guns
to be illegally distributed.

03:00.810 --> 03:01.970
Every single
one of them

03:02.010 --> 03:04.274
was bought within
two miles of here.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.049
Whoa.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.638
They're all unloaded?
Mm-hmm.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.978
Slide the bolt to check
for a chambered round.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.442
Drop the magazine.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.310
Do a physical check
of the barrel.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.651
You're unloaded.

03:15.690 --> 03:17.328
It's so odd--

03:17.360 --> 03:19.328
the attraction to handguns.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.554
It's almost
primal.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.659
It's a good look--
Sarah Palin-esque.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.793
Oh, wow. Thank you.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.229
Oh. What about that one?

03:26.270 --> 03:28.864
Walther PPK,
seven-shot, 9mm.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.731
And how much would this cost
on the street?

03:30.770 --> 03:31.907
It depends.

03:31.940 --> 03:33.976
That was 50.
CARY:
Check this out.

03:34.010 --> 03:36.604
DIANE: It's so small.
CARY:
Colin Sweeney?

03:36.650 --> 03:37.969
I heard it was
a necrophilia thing.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.568
JULIUS:
Nope. Chopped her up.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.315
Put her in
the dog food.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.647
Don't know what the hell
that jury was thinking.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.487
Tough to convict
when they never found a body.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.646
It's the perfect crime.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.351
DIANE:_
Do people still use
sawed-off shotguns these days

03:47.390 --> 03:48.516
or is pass?

03:48.560 --> 03:49.788
So, why is Alicia on it?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.388
JULIUS:
Oh, you know why.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.250
Her husband prosecuted
him the first time.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.392
So?

03:54.430 --> 03:55.897
Who better to defend him?

03:57.930 --> 03:59.397
Mrs. Florrick.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.567
A pleasure
to meet you.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.307
Don't worry.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.807
I killed her with my other hand.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.337
Joking.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.904
Sorry.
I've developed

04:09.950 --> 04:12.976
a perverse sense of the comic
over the last year.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.942
WILL:
Okay, well, let's try
not to joke like that

04:14.980 --> 04:16.379
in court, shall we?

04:16.420 --> 04:18.786
You think it'll come
to that-- court?

04:18.820 --> 04:21.880
Cantwell is a top litigator--
he wants a trial.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.524
Our goal is to avoid a jury.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.027
You're in a similar situation
to O.J.,

04:25.060 --> 04:27.051
if you don't mind me
continuing the metaphor.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.022
Like O.J.,
you were found not guilty,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.028
but people think
you did it,

04:31.070 --> 04:33.288
and they want to see you hurt.
Your stepdaughter

04:33.340 --> 04:35.433
is counting on that-- that's why
she's suing you in civil court.

04:35.470 --> 04:38.769
Charlotte-- we never _
saw eye to eye, I'm afraid.

04:38.810 --> 04:42.348
She resented Carolyn
leaving her father for me.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.870
Unfortunately, the Illinois
slayer statute says

04:43.910 --> 04:46.617
you can't inherit someone's
estate if you cause their death.

04:46.650 --> 04:49.619
If Charlotte wins,
she gets the money, the company.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.481
What do you think,
Mrs. Florrick?

04:55.460 --> 04:56.984
What do I think
about what?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.088
Your husband
prosecuted me.

04:58.130 --> 05:01.520
You must have an opinion
as to my guilt or innocence.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.323
My opinion is irrelevant.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.496
Not to me.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.395
Not at this moment.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.431
You think I killed my wife?

05:08.470 --> 05:10.563
Of course.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.579
Look, you pay us

05:14.610 --> 05:15.907
to represent
your interests...

05:15.940 --> 05:18.044
Even though her body
was never found?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.775
I'm sure you found ways
to dispose of it.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.946
Chopped her up

05:20.980 --> 05:23.414
and buried her
in a landfill somewhere?

05:23.450 --> 05:24.382
Or in Lake Michigan.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.944
And my alibi?

05:25.990 --> 05:27.389
That you were driving

05:27.420 --> 05:29.923
from St. Louis to Chicago
at the time?

05:29.960 --> 05:32.451
So you have no problem

05:32.500 --> 05:34.456
representing a murderer?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.525
Oh, I have
a great problem with it.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.424
But you'll do it anyway?

05:38.470 --> 05:40.461
Unless you'd like to exclude me.

05:42.470 --> 05:43.937
Oh, not for the world.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.107
Okay, great.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.607
Well, now that we've
got that settled...

05:46.640 --> 05:47.777
MAN:
All rise.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.448
(door hinges squeaking)

05:49.480 --> 05:51.402
JUDGE:
Sit down.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.475
Cory, let's get
some WD-4O

05:53.520 --> 05:54.509
on that.

05:54.550 --> 05:55.710
(gallery chatter)

05:55.750 --> 05:57.047
Calm down.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.148
(phone keypad beeping)

05:58.190 --> 05:59.589
(clears throat)

05:59.620 --> 06:01.679
Give me that.
You. Now.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.982
Don't try
to hide it.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.385
Now!

06:06.160 --> 06:07.923
Okay, now, I know

06:07.960 --> 06:09.962
you're all are excited
about this trial,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.639
but this is a probate matter,
and, as such,

06:12.670 --> 06:14.467
you're just visiting here.
I live here.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.694
My rules go.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.059
Mr. Gardner,
are you ready?

06:17.110 --> 06:18.134
Yes, Your Honor.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.706
Mr. Cantwell?

06:20.710 --> 06:22.029
Where the hell
is Cantwell?

06:22.080 --> 06:23.707
(clears throat)

06:23.750 --> 06:25.172
I, uh...

06:25.210 --> 06:26.575
Who are you?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.679
Nancy Crozier...

06:28.720 --> 06:30.483
Your Honor.
Mr. Cantwell

06:30.520 --> 06:32.181
has taken sick,
and the plaintiff

06:32.220 --> 06:33.949
has asked_ me
to step In.

06:33.990 --> 06:35.150
Miss Armitage?

06:35.190 --> 06:36.282
Yes.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.720
You can request
a continuance if
you would like to

06:38.760 --> 06:39.897
look for other representation.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.192
As you can see, the defense

06:41.230 --> 06:44.028
has spared no expense.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.937
Yes, uh, I know,
Your Honor, but

06:46.970 --> 06:48.892
Nancy and I go way back,
and I think

06:48.940 --> 06:50.202
I'd rather go
with someone I trust.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.175
Ma'am, you're not old enough
to go way back,

06:53.210 --> 06:54.507
but if, uh, Miss...

06:54.540 --> 06:55.677
What is it?

06:55.710 --> 06:57.109
Crozier.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.708
...Crozier is
your ch0|ce...

06:58.750 --> 07:00.115
Come on up here, Miss Crozier.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.549
Okay.

07:01.580 --> 07:02.319
That's where
you Sit.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.545
Slip in a motion
for a bench trial

07:04.590 --> 07:05.545
before she knows
what hit her.

07:05.590 --> 07:08.457
Your Honor, just a quick request
before we begin.

07:08.490 --> 07:10.754
We respect your judgment
in this matter, and

07:10.790 --> 07:12.519
we would like to ask
for this to be a bench trial.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.754
Miss Crozier?

07:13.800 --> 07:15.222
I'm sorry. Could you...?

07:15.260 --> 07:16.249
What was the

07:16.300 --> 07:18.518
question,
Your Honor?
They would
like this

07:18.570 --> 07:19.832
to be a bench trial.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.201
They want not to have a jury.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.129
Do you have
an argument?

07:27.180 --> 07:28.636
I don't know.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.240
Well, if you
don't know, then

07:31.280 --> 07:34.215
I must decide against you.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.877
Well,

07:35.920 --> 07:37.547
the one thing that I would say,
Your Honor,

07:37.590 --> 07:41.185
is that... that I do think
that it would be fairer

07:41.220 --> 07:44.519
to have a cross_ section
of people, not just one.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.857
Please don't take that
the wrong way.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.027
ALICIA:
Your Honor,

07:47.060 --> 07:50.223
I think that it
would be... fairer

07:50.270 --> 07:52.488
if we decide this matter

07:52.540 --> 07:54.895
on the law, not on the
passions of a jury.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.498
Miss Crozier?

07:56.540 --> 07:57.632
(Crozier clears
her throat)

07:57.670 --> 08:00.969
That might be true, but I'm not
going to try and, uh...

08:01.010 --> 08:02.272
rile up

08:02.310 --> 08:03.777
those passions.

08:03.810 --> 08:06.574
Ijust... I want them
to hear the truth.

08:06.620 --> 08:10.716
Well, you've won your first
argument, Miss Crozier.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.253
We'll start choosing a
jury tomorrow morning.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.780
Thank you.
(gavelbangs)

08:14.820 --> 08:15.957
What happened?

08:15.990 --> 08:18.720
Cute, perlq, 26 just happened.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.719
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

08:36.310 --> 08:39.848
GOLDEN: Thank you for giving us
some of your time, Mr. Brody.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.279
What do you want?

08:41.320 --> 08:43.845
We're going
to subpoena you to testify.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.916
You do understand I'll
be a hostile witness?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.315
We understand that you weren't
always so hostile.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.918
That was before
you were corrupt.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.292
I think we're saying
that we're not the enemy.

08:53.330 --> 08:56.197
Peter hired you at the
State's Attorney's Office.

08:56.230 --> 08:57.993
He promoted
you four times.

08:58.030 --> 09:00.339
Glenn Childs promoted you once.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.167
He'll never let you rise
any higher.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.839
He thinks you have one leg
still in Peter's camp.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.269
Oh, so that's what
this is about?

09:06.310 --> 09:07.834
Influencing
my testimony.
PETER: No.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.336
It's about getting you
to tell the truth,

09:09.380 --> 09:10.699
even if it hurts Childs.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.274
I have always
told the truth.

09:12.310 --> 09:15.245
PETER: I know a lot of people
who've always told the truth,

09:15.280 --> 09:17.282
and yet, here I stand.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.288
Let me ask you something.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.719
Are you really fulfilled

09:20.760 --> 09:23.183
chasing my wife
from court to court?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.255
I respected you.

09:25.290 --> 09:27.724
Childs has turned you
into an errand boy.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.728
Mr. Florrick,
you hired me.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.294
I'm grateful for that.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.295
You ran a tough
department.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.659
I admire that.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.928
But the day

09:36.970 --> 09:38.164
you started slipping
your wife information

09:38.210 --> 09:42.078
to use in court, that's the
day I lost respect for you...

09:42.110 --> 09:44.601
(laughs)

09:47.180 --> 09:48.670
Seems like
a busy room.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.119
They asked me here.

09:50.150 --> 09:51.742
Yes, they asked
me here, too.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.350
They must have wanted us
to bump into each other.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.585
Just a quirk
in scheduling.

09:58.060 --> 10:00.028
I told them to go to hell.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.858
I have no doubt.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.736
(door opening)

10:06.770 --> 10:08.328
So that's why I'm here?

10:08.370 --> 10:09.189
To see Matan leaving?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.333
We needed a fourth
in our pinochle game.

10:11.370 --> 10:12.701
Next time,
phone me

10:12.740 --> 10:14.276
with your strategic plan,

10:14.310 --> 10:16.870
so I don't have _
to actually leave my office.

10:19.150 --> 10:21.141
Poor show.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.284
You think it worked?

10:26.350 --> 10:30.252
I think we'll know more
when Matan testifies.

10:30.290 --> 10:34.294
WILL: You think he'd sell
them after his wife's death.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.252
ALICIA: My guess is he didn't
buy them until then.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.000
So, are they going to go
with electronic monitoring?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.268
For Peter?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.834
Yes, if he wins the appeal.

10:45.870 --> 10:46.802
Kids are excited?

10:46.840 --> 10:48.330
Yeah... but nervous.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.041
And you?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.308
Same.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.671
It's going to be weird, huh?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.278
What do you mean?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.878
I don't know what I mean.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.118
We said we'd have
dinner, didn't we?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.684
Yes.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.981
We should.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.351
Hmm.
SWEENEY:
So sorry to keep you waiting.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.697
You're comfortable,
I hope.

11:09.730 --> 11:11.698
After Carolyn disappeared,

11:11.730 --> 11:13.459
I sold the house
and moved in here.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.162
A bit cramped,
unfortunately.

11:18.170 --> 11:19.979
Now, as I
understand it,

11:20.010 --> 11:22.399
you're going to try to
make me more likable.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.001
Well, in a civil case, we
can't keep you off the stand.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.369
You have to testify.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.069
Yes, before a jury.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.485
That was unexpected.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.353
WILL: Unexpected things
happen in a courtroom,

11:33.390 --> 11:35.483
Mr. Sweeney; that's why we try
to avoid them if we can.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.385
And now you're worried

11:37.430 --> 11:40.297
I'll say something unfortunate
on the stand like

11:40.330 --> 11:42.093
what I did with
her remains?

11:42.130 --> 11:43.791
Take this seriously,
Mr. Sweeney.

11:43.830 --> 11:45.422
If you value your money,

11:45.470 --> 11:47.233
you should take
this seriously.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.864
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.470
Of course.

11:52.510 --> 11:55.104
And I do value my money,

11:55.140 --> 11:57.142
so I will.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.175
ALICIA:
A civil case can get ugly.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.949
They can pick apart
your marital troubles

12:01.980 --> 12:03.811
with a fine-tooth comb.

12:03.850 --> 12:05.442
You two fought a
lot, didn't you?

12:05.490 --> 12:06.479
Constantly.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.422
Carolyn and I had
a tempestuous relationship.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.257
But we were devoted
to each other,

12:12.290 --> 12:13.496
classically S and M.

12:13.530 --> 12:16.158
That's her?
Yes.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.293
She hated that photo,

12:18.330 --> 12:19.490
so I had it enlarged.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.134
They will put on
evidence that you

12:21.170 --> 12:22.831
were unfaithful to her
With multiple women.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.167
Is that true?

12:24.210 --> 12:27.077
Well, I had sex
with other women.

12:27.110 --> 12:29.499
Carolyn didn't do tricks.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.474
She knew I needed them,

12:31.510 --> 12:33.319
so she was okay with me
going elsewhere.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.545
I'm sorry, "tricks"?

12:35.580 --> 12:38.515
Leather, handcuffs,
cross-dressing...

12:38.550 --> 12:40.381
Does that make me
more likable or less?

12:40.420 --> 12:41.557
I've lost track

12:41.590 --> 12:43.478
of the Zeitgeist
these days.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.849
But you still claim
you were in love?

12:44.890 --> 12:46.152
Yes, madly.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.367
Her accountant testified
at the murder trial

12:50.400 --> 12:52.288
that she demanded to see
the books that day,

12:52.330 --> 12:54.833
and something she saw
apparently upset her.

12:54.870 --> 12:57.134
One of the things
she saw was this.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.035
Withdrawals,
made by you,

12:59.070 --> 13:00.401
for hundreds and
thousands of dollars.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.898
I told you. Carolyn didn't
begrudge me my appetites.

13:05.950 --> 13:08.009
There were rumors
that she wanted to oust you

13:08.050 --> 13:09.210
from the family business.
Yes,

13:09.250 --> 13:12.879
and there were rumors you knew
of your husband's whores.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.480
Probably not
the best answer in court.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.329
Is it true that

13:17.360 --> 13:18.452
when they told you of
your wife's death,

13:18.490 --> 13:23.393
you said, "Oh, no, now I'll need
a fourth for bridge."

13:23.430 --> 13:25.022
Yes.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.334
And when Paul McCartney was told

13:27.370 --> 13:30.931
of John Lennon's death,
he said, "What a drag."

13:35.980 --> 13:37.447
(sighs)

13:37.480 --> 13:40.210
I'm not going to be a
very good witness, am I?

13:41.480 --> 13:43.243
No, you're not.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.082
I didn't do it.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.520
How did that sound?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.161
Volquartsen 3.5 compact.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.566
Weight: three pounds,
ten-shot mag,

14:00.600 --> 14:02.488
adjustable rear
and blade front--

14:02.540 --> 14:04.599
it'll take down
any man in his tracks.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.336
What if she doesn't have a FOID?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.632
Apply for one.
You'll have a gun in 30 days.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.500
What if she doesn't
have 30 days?

14:11.550 --> 14:12.972
Do you have a Firearm Owner ID?

14:14.580 --> 14:16.616
Then buy it for her.

14:18.350 --> 14:21.183
Excuse me.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.551
That's our case.

14:22.590 --> 14:24.626
That's how illegal guns
get out on the street.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.480
So, do you want to buy it?

14:26.530 --> 14:28.521
Do we need it?

14:28.560 --> 14:29.492
I don't know.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.088
Do you?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.532
I was checking on a court date
and I found out.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.101
You passed on the lawsuit.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.644
So, what are we doing here?

14:49.280 --> 14:52.579
Ten years ago, a drug dealer
named Jeffrey Spellman

14:52.620 --> 14:56.511
was convicted of double
murder in the 24th Ward.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.425
At his sentencing hearing,
he threatened

14:58.460 --> 15:00.052
to kill his lavwer
when he got out.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.159
You were his lavwer?

15:03.570 --> 15:06.994
I also spoke last week
at his parole hearing.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.031
He saw you speak?

15:10.670 --> 15:13.377
He'd made
subsequent threats.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.102
Has he been released?

15:16.140 --> 15:18.244
They decide on Friday.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.941
Okay.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.345
You need a gun.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.348
No, the thing is, I've
been in the forefront

15:23.390 --> 15:24.584
of gun control
my entire life.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.713
My father wrote
the first legislation

15:26.750 --> 15:28.479
into the Illinois constitution.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.714
You need something
easy to shoot.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.524
Light on recoil,
9mm-- a Beretta.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.619
No, this was a mistake.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.424
Look, I know you're my boss,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.461
and I'll do
whatever you want.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.538
You spoke at a killer's
parole hearing

15:43.570 --> 15:45.606
and he saw you speak
against his release.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.700
That's what I'd call
a volatile situation.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.139
So listen to me on this.

15:50.180 --> 15:51.670
You need a gun.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.619
It was a task force focusing
on fraudulent real estate deals.

15:58.650 --> 16:01.483
And these deals
were called "land flips"?

16:01.520 --> 16:03.454
Yes.
And as you understood it,

16:03.490 --> 16:05.549
there was an attempt
to buy land, cheaply,

16:05.590 --> 16:06.784
through fraudulent means,

16:06.830 --> 16:09.594
near the stadiums that were
to be built for the Olympics?

16:09.630 --> 16:10.767
Yes, sir.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.529
And during
the time you were

16:12.570 --> 16:14.458
heading up this
task force,

16:14.500 --> 16:16.092
you were approached
by Mr. Childs

16:16.140 --> 16:18.700
to keep an eye on Mr. Florrick,
isn't that correct?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.676
Could you define
"keep an eye on"?

16:23.710 --> 16:25.701
He suggested
that Mr. Florrick

16:25.750 --> 16:28.719
had a hidden motive
for this task force.

16:28.750 --> 16:29.910
Objection, Your Honor.

16:29.950 --> 16:34.011
I have no idea why you are
objecting to that, Mr. Landry.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.516
A leading question,
Your Honor.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.348
I know I might need a scorecard
here, Mr. Landry.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.620
Isn't Mr. Brody
a hostile witness?

16:41.660 --> 16:43.161
Isn't he on your side?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.622
It's still leading,
Your Honor.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.537
Overruled. _
You may answer the question.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.162
Yes.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.101
You may have to remind us all
what that "yes" means.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.506
Yes, Mr. Childs suggested

16:54.540 --> 16:56.337
Peter might have
a hidden motive.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.699
This hidden motive was that

16:57.750 --> 17:00.639
Mr. Florrick arranged
this task force

17:00.680 --> 17:01.715
in order to then
shake down

17:01.750 --> 17:05.311
the real estate developers
for payoffs?
Yes, sir.

17:05.350 --> 17:08.251
And did you agree
with Mr. Childs' estimation?

17:08.290 --> 17:10.053
My opinion was irrelevant.

17:10.090 --> 17:11.455
I did what I was asked.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.549
By whom?

17:13.600 --> 17:15.090
Excuse me.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.722
You said that you did
what you were asked.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.523
Who were you referring to?

17:18.570 --> 17:20.265
It was a figure of speech.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.235
I understand,
but figures of speech
mean something, so who

17:23.270 --> 17:25.500
asked you to do something:
was it your boss, Mr. Florrick,

17:25.540 --> 17:29.271
or was it Mr. Childs,
your peer?

17:32.480 --> 17:33.845
Mr. Childs.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.814
What did he ask you to do?

17:37.650 --> 17:39.709
He asked me
to keep track of Peter.

17:39.750 --> 17:43.550
He thought he was being
bribed to DP cases.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.285
And so,

17:45.330 --> 17:47.093
how are these cases going now?

17:48.130 --> 17:49.427
Excuse me?

17:49.460 --> 17:52.623
These cases that Mr. Florrick
asked you to drop--

17:52.670 --> 17:53.864
I mean, you must be fervently

17:53.900 --> 17:55.697
pursuing them now
that Peter Florrick

17:55.740 --> 17:58.334
is no longer around
to obstruct them.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.803
No, sir.
My goodness.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.728
What happened to them?

18:04.410 --> 18:06.071
We dropped them.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.378
Your witness.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.717
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.820
Uh, actually,
just to be clear,

18:17.860 --> 18:21.626
you are the defendant's
sister-in-law, Mariel?

18:21.660 --> 18:23.423
The defendant who killed
my Sister?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.290
Yes.
Your Honor, do I

18:25.330 --> 18:26.888
really need to object?
We all need

18:26.930 --> 18:29.330
to perform our roles here,
Mr. Gardner.

18:29.370 --> 18:30.803
Yes, you need
to object,

18:30.840 --> 18:32.728
and, yes, I need to sustain.

18:32.770 --> 18:35.238
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
We won't let that happen again.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.872
Now, I have to ask you

18:36.910 --> 18:39.799
a question
that I am not proud of.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.344
A sexual question.
Do you mind?
MARIEL: No.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.688
Please. That's
why I'm here.
Okay.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.449
You and the defendant,

18:48.490 --> 18:51.323
Mr. Sweeney, had

18:51.360 --> 18:52.918
sexual relations?

18:52.960 --> 18:53.858
Yeah.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.892
He had sex with his wife's

18:56.930 --> 18:58.625
sister?
Yeah, that's correct.

18:58.670 --> 18:59.796
Sorry.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.832
Ithink I'm blushing.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.201
I'm from Michigan.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.662
This is all new to me.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.462
She's very good.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.501
Uh, Miss Armitage,

19:08.540 --> 19:10.679
what could possibly
have led you

19:10.710 --> 19:13.144
to sleep with your own
sister's husband?

19:13.950 --> 19:16.373
I struggled with addiction
my whole life,

19:16.420 --> 19:18.786
and my sister
and I were

19:18.820 --> 19:21.459
estranged over it.

19:21.490 --> 19:23.958
So I suppose I--
I don't know--

19:23.990 --> 19:25.480
I did it just
to get back at her.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.896
And Colin was too
happy to help.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.898
He used to make
me do things.

19:29.930 --> 19:31.659
You know, things his wife
wouldn't do.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.533
Like the time he
had me tie up his...
(stammering)

19:34.570 --> 19:36.868
I think that
that is enough.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.663
I'm just going to sit down.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.170
Thank you.

19:41.210 --> 19:43.872
Great job, Daniel,
just outstanding.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.502
Did you see Childs?

19:45.550 --> 19:47.211
(laughs)
(phone chimes)

19:47.250 --> 19:49.241
I think we're getting
really close now.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.480
What?

19:52.520 --> 19:54.249
Roman Belikov,
the Russian mobster

19:54.290 --> 19:55.917
we used to threaten
Amber Madison with?

19:55.960 --> 19:57.359
What about him?

19:57.390 --> 19:59.278
Not such a threat anymore.

20:09.940 --> 20:13.376
Amber told Childs
that she wouldn't testify.

20:13.410 --> 20:15.378
I guess now she'll
be out for blood.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.241
It's not going to be pretty.

20:28.990 --> 20:30.981
No. I won't be there.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.860
No, I understand.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.039
It might be rough.

20:41.070 --> 20:43.709
Madison could
say anything.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.401
Although Golden does
think it would be better

20:45.440 --> 20:46.805
if you were
there, so that

20:46.840 --> 20:48.831
the judge could see we...

20:49.940 --> 20:52.340
Golden also says that
the sheriff's department

20:52.380 --> 20:54.917
will be setting up electronic
monitoring at the house

20:54.950 --> 20:56.918
ifI am released.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.783
Are you all right
with that?
Yes.

21:01.820 --> 21:04.380
But I wanted to agree
on a few things first.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.290
Okay.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.827
There's a maid's room.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.064
I've been using it for storage,

21:14.100 --> 21:16.034
but I will clear it out
and put a bed in there.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.868
In the meantime,
you can use the master bath.

21:20.910 --> 21:23.674
Jackie has been
helping out on weekdays

21:23.710 --> 21:25.075
while I'm at work,

21:25.110 --> 21:26.702
and I think
she should continue--

21:26.750 --> 21:28.809
picking the kids up
from school, making dinner...

21:30.050 --> 21:31.711
And we don't have a study.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.787
I still have your old
rolltop desk; it's in storage.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.459
I will move it
to the dining room.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.458
Okay?

21:39.490 --> 21:41.094
Do you love me?

21:41.130 --> 21:43.360
I do.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.925
You're sounding like a lawyer.

21:46.970 --> 21:49.666
I am a lavwer.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.759
Do you ever want
to be together again?

21:53.940 --> 21:56.079
Peter...

21:59.610 --> 22:01.111
I've been hurt, deeply.

22:01.150 --> 22:04.415
I imagine
I will heal someday,

22:04.450 --> 22:06.987
but for now...

22:07.020 --> 22:09.614
we need a plan, okay?

22:09.660 --> 22:12.083
Okay.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.451
KALINDA:
The grip is still.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.468
Focus is on the front sight.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.525
Are you steady?

22:19.570 --> 22:20.764
I think so.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.098
Now the hardest
part-- the trigger.

22:23.140 --> 22:25.005
There's a natural
tendency for the muscles

22:25.040 --> 22:27.600
in the hand and wrist to move
in tandem with the fingers.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.005
You need to resist that.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.678
You need to let
your forefinger act

22:30.710 --> 22:32.109
independently, squeezing.

22:32.150 --> 22:33.947
Do you
understand?

22:33.980 --> 22:34.878
I think so.

22:34.920 --> 22:38.788
And so, with almost
no pressure at all,

22:38.820 --> 22:41.152
concentrate on the center
of your target.

22:41.190 --> 22:43.454
Why can't I shoot to injure?

22:43.490 --> 22:45.151
You pick up a gun,
you shoot to kill

22:45.190 --> 22:46.452
or you don't pick up a gun.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.991
(sighs)

22:51.030 --> 22:52.998
He got out--

22:53.030 --> 22:55.032
your parolee.

22:55.070 --> 22:55.968
I know.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.865
You're trying to stop
with deadly force

22:57.910 --> 22:59.400
somebody who is trying
to kill you.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.304
Somebody
who has

23:00.340 --> 23:03.036
a mother, a father,
birthday parties.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.741
They're a shadow target,

23:04.780 --> 23:06.771
a bull's-eye.

23:06.810 --> 23:08.016
So you dehumanize them?

23:08.050 --> 23:09.608
They are dehumanized.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.743
The world doesn't
march to your drummer.

23:11.790 --> 23:13.951
It's sometimes
dangerous and cruel,

23:13.990 --> 23:16.959
so slowly and carefully
raise your weapon,

23:16.990 --> 23:18.855
make your finger work
independenﬂy

23:18.890 --> 23:20.050
of your fist
and arm,

23:20.090 --> 23:24.459
and gently and
indifferently squeeze.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.967
Oh, my God.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.438
Nice.

23:30.470 --> 23:33.928
Raise your arm
and try again.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.640
So, um, as I was saying,
Mr. Sweeney,

23:41.680 --> 23:46.185
there was blood and skin found
on a rope at your house, right?

23:46.220 --> 23:47.653
Yes, that's right.

23:47.690 --> 23:51.126
And, uh, this blood and skin--

23:51.160 --> 23:53.799
the police say
it all matched your wife.

23:53.830 --> 23:55.195
Is that right?

23:55.230 --> 23:57.460
Yes, we like to cut
our own firewood

23:57.500 --> 23:59.127
and wrap the
kindling in rope,

23:59.170 --> 24:01.832
and I believe my
dearest Carolyn

24:01.870 --> 24:04.566
cut herself.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.202
CROZIER:
Yeah, that seems
understandable, I get that.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.174
(sighs)

24:08.210 --> 24:11.771
So, I need to ask you this,
Mr. Sweeney, please excuse me.

24:11.810 --> 24:13.141
Go right ahead, dear.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.875
You never strangled
your wife, right?

24:14.920 --> 24:17.115
(chuckling):
My goodness, no.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.082
Thank God.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.678
(chuckles)

24:19.720 --> 24:22.587
So this, uh...

24:24.190 --> 24:25.555
...here.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.784
What is this?

24:27.830 --> 24:30.196
Hospital report.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.891
WILL:
Here it comes.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.091
You object--
it'll play better from you.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.563
This-this_must_ be
an aberration, right?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.739
I don't know, I can't see it.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.169
It says here
that your wife was admitted

24:40.210 --> 24:42.701
to the hospital, April 1997.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.207
Objection, Your Honor.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.899
This was excluded
from the previous trial

24:45.950 --> 24:47.611
for relevance.

24:47.650 --> 24:48.947
I'll allow.

24:48.980 --> 24:50.880
Your exception is
noted, Counselor.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.115
Sit down.
CROZIER:
Your wife seems to have
told the medical staff

24:53.150 --> 24:54.913
something
extraordinary.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.281
She said that you tried
to strangle her.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.288
That's a bit melodramatic.

24:59.330 --> 25:00.820
Yes, I know
it is, but

25:00.860 --> 25:02.953
my mom always used to say
"When you don't know,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.160
ask," so...

25:04.200 --> 25:05.269
this is me asking.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.324
Certainly.

25:06.370 --> 25:09.828
Carolyn and I were
practitioners of breath play.

25:09.870 --> 25:11.303
I'm sorry,
what is

25:11.340 --> 25:12.932
breath play?
Well, I'm sure

25:12.970 --> 25:15.734
they have it in Michigan,
too, Miss Crozier.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.305
Breath play is
erotic asphyxiation.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.204
Carolyn liked
the feeling

25:20.250 --> 25:23.549
of being strangled when
she was having sex.

25:27.250 --> 25:30.583
Oh, I think
I'd better sit down now.

25:32.590 --> 25:34.649
Your witness.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.662
WILL:
Okay, we go on the offensive.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.258
I'm not going to let
some 26-year-old

25:40.300 --> 25:41.995
law school grad get
the better of me.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.995
It's an act.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.166
Well, it's working.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.802
If we can't prove
our guy is innocent,

25:45.840 --> 25:47.899
we need to shovel dirt
on somebody else.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.032
What about
the plaintiff?

25:49.080 --> 25:51.207
_ Charlotte?
The jury felt sorry for her.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.342
She lost her mother.

25:52.380 --> 25:53.472
We can't suggest
she's the killer.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.570
Go after the sister Mariel,
suggest she was the killer.

25:56.620 --> 25:57.939
The jury liked her, too.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.049
They didn't like her,
they believed her.

26:00.090 --> 26:01.648
WILL:
I'm listening.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.214
Mariel was jealous
of her sister.

26:03.260 --> 26:05.182
She slept with Sweeney
to get back at her.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.619
In my experience, that level
of jealousy just doesn't end.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.150
Did the cops even
check her alibi?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.292
Supposedly
she was in rehab

26:10.330 --> 26:11.922
when Carolyn disappeared.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.995
Okay, get a subpoena
for the records, and, Alicia,

26:14.040 --> 26:15.098
if we're tearing down
the sister's alibi,

26:15.140 --> 26:16.289
we need to shore
up Sweeney's.

26:16.340 --> 26:17.659
How fun.
YEP,

26:17.710 --> 26:19.735
you're the Sweeney
wrangler these days.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.907
SWEENEY:
I told you I was in my car

26:22.940 --> 26:25.044
on the drive back
from St. Louis.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.743
With no GPS
and no cell phone?

26:28.780 --> 26:30.077
You like manga?

26:30.120 --> 26:34.318
I find the style
bracingly visceral.

26:34.360 --> 26:38.023
You weren't on your way
back from St. Louis,

26:38.060 --> 26:40.949
were you?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.149
No.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.293
Do you know that we're losing?

26:45.330 --> 26:47.298
Yes.

26:47.330 --> 26:51.130
So no stories, no lies,

26:51.170 --> 26:53.229
no diversions.

26:53.270 --> 26:54.373
Where were you?

26:58.280 --> 27:00.748
SWEENEY:
Marco, this is my lavwer.

27:00.780 --> 27:04.682
I need you to tell her where I
was the day my wife disappeared.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.779
I got here about 3:30

27:07.820 --> 27:10.209
like I always do.

27:10.260 --> 27:13.081
You rolled up after that,
looking to score some opie.

27:13.130 --> 27:17.419
Opium, sometimes mixed
with hash.

27:17.460 --> 27:21.430
Now you see why I didn't
tell you before?

27:21.470 --> 27:22.835
So you didn't do it?

27:22.870 --> 27:24.701
Kill Carolyn? No.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.731
Then why all the
games and the jokes?

27:26.770 --> 27:27.930
MARCO:
Do you guys mind?

27:27.980 --> 27:31.347
I'm working here.

27:31.380 --> 27:32.779
You know when I
started getting

27:32.810 --> 27:35.313
the best tables
in restaurants?

27:35.350 --> 27:38.410
The day they thought
I killed my wife.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.280
Is that really worth

27:39.320 --> 27:41.880
getting the best tables
in restaurants?

27:41.920 --> 27:43.888
Of course.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.387
Why do you look at
me the way you do?

27:46.430 --> 27:49.695
Why is my picture on the front
page of the Chicago Sun-Times?

27:49.730 --> 27:54.269
Why does Page Six care
what play I saw last night?

27:54.300 --> 27:57.360
If your wife is dead, and
everyone thinks you did it,

27:57.400 --> 28:02.008
well, really, what's
the difference?

28:04.480 --> 28:06.971
Miss Crozier.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.409
Hello?

28:08.450 --> 28:11.180
Oh, hi.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.949
I'm sorry, I've
forgotten your name.

28:12.990 --> 28:14.014
Alicia Florrick.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.254
Right, nice
to see you.

28:15.290 --> 28:17.315
I really hope that we
can make a deal today.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.954
I just hate this
courtroom fighting.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.049
Yes, well, Will suggested
that we get started,

28:22.100 --> 28:24.398
and he will join us later.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.125
You're doing
very well in court.

28:26.170 --> 28:27.865
Oh, I don't know
about that.

28:27.900 --> 28:28.867
I'm just a beginner.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.197
Hmm, no, you're not.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.730
Why do you say that?

28:31.770 --> 28:34.170
Because I think you know
exactly what you're doing.

28:34.210 --> 28:35.507
(chuckles)

28:35.540 --> 28:37.303
I Wish I did.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.807
Your witness Mariel--

28:38.850 --> 28:40.772
she doesn't have an alibi
the night of the murder.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.219
She left rehab at 4:00.
And what,

28:42.250 --> 28:44.980
rushed over to kill
her Sister out of jealousy?

28:45.020 --> 28:46.248
Been known to happen.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.382
The jury didn't hate her.

28:47.420 --> 28:48.751
They hated your client.

28:48.790 --> 28:49.882
We Spoke to
Mr. Sweeney.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.229
He's willing to offer your
client 50% of the estate.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.921
No.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.257
Charlotte lost her mother
to Sweeney.

28:55.300 --> 28:56.949
He has to walk away
from the estate.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.026
She'll offer him a yearly
stipend-- low six figures.

29:00.070 --> 29:01.799
No.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.034
Mr. Sweeney has an alibi.

29:03.070 --> 29:04.469
Well, I'm sure
it's a good one.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.161
It'll be fun
to try and prove it.

29:07.210 --> 29:10.008
I guess we don't have
anything to talk about, then.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.009
But it was nice to meet you.

29:13.050 --> 29:16.042
And I really love
your jacket.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.481
My mom has one just like it.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.954
(phone chimes)

29:24.560 --> 29:27.484
Our top story tonight involves
the shocking developments

29:27.530 --> 29:30.158
in the Carolyn Armitage
disappearance case.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.360
Police strongly suspect

29:31.400 --> 29:35.564
that Armitage's remains
have been uncovered.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.569
A c_onstr_uction crew made_the
grisly discovery this morning

29:38.610 --> 29:41.499
in the courtyard of Colin
Sweeney's penthouse apartment,

29:41.540 --> 29:44.202
a residency sold after
the disappearance of his wife.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.901
The remains, which were found
in a shallow grave

29:46.950 --> 29:49.168
in the flower garden,
have yet to be identified,

29:49.220 --> 29:50.448
but investigators believe

29:50.480 --> 29:53.916
they belong
to the missing Carolyn Armitage.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.520
I don't know why I feel bad.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.482
At least we know
for certain now he did it.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.883
Yep,

29:59.930 --> 30:01.352
and we're still defending him.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.096
...Chicago society figure,
Colin Sweeney,

30:04.130 --> 30:07.122
a man who many believe
is entirely capable of murder.

30:13.610 --> 30:15.077
ALICIA:
Oh, don't even try it.

30:15.110 --> 30:16.873
(sniffles):
What?

30:16.910 --> 30:19.071
To patronize me
with your tears.

30:20.280 --> 30:23.613
I thought somewhere in
the back of my mind--

30:23.650 --> 30:27.859
and I will admit that
it made no sense--

30:27.890 --> 30:31.155
Carolyn might be still alive.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.448
Like Ken Lay,

30:34.500 --> 30:36.525
faking his own death,
and hopping off

30:36.560 --> 30:37.959
to a small island somewhere.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.865
So you're saying you had
nothing to do with this?

30:39.900 --> 30:43.199
I'm sayi I've done

30:43.240 --> 30:46.505
some terrible things
in my life. I have.

30:46.540 --> 30:49.031
But I did not kill my wife.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.174
Then how did her skull end up
buried in your baclqard?

30:52.210 --> 30:54.417
Someone put it there!

30:57.080 --> 30:58.980
Peter's the sort of man

30:59.020 --> 31:00.612
who expects things
to be handed to him.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.584
Like I was.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.485
This was at the hotel?
Yes.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.883
I had a room.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.558
He called his wife,
said he'd be late.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.158
And then afterwards,
he asked me

31:10.200 --> 31:11.599
if he could
see me again.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.097
How many times?

31:13.130 --> 31:14.461
Two dozen.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.092
It went on for months.

31:16.140 --> 31:18.165
Sometimes two,
three times a week.

31:18.210 --> 31:21.668
And he knew you were
being provided to him?
Yes.

31:21.710 --> 31:24.941
AMBER:
Afterwards, I would make
a call in order to be paid.

31:24.980 --> 31:26.538
He heard me
make those calls.

31:27.710 --> 31:29.917
Mrs. Florrick.

31:29.950 --> 31:31.918
LANDRY:
...say anything about
having to do something

31:31.950 --> 31:33.611
in return for your...
Would you like to come in?

31:33.650 --> 31:35.379
services?

31:35.420 --> 31:36.648
AMBER:
Yes.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.658
He told me that the men

31:38.690 --> 31:40.999
who paid me had
cases against them.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.998
He understood

31:43.030 --> 31:44.668
that he had to do something
about those cases.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.292
"Do something"?

31:46.330 --> 31:49.265
Oh, um, make them go away.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.665
He laughed about
it, actually.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.509
Said that was
the price

31:52.540 --> 31:54.531
of doing business in Chicago.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.971
LANDRY:
Your Witness.

31:58.010 --> 31:59.546
GOLDEN:
Ms. Madison,

31:59.580 --> 32:01.946
you say that Mr. Florrick
knew that someone else

32:01.980 --> 32:03.049
was paying for your services?

32:03.080 --> 32:04.616
Yes.
Then,

32:04.650 --> 32:06.242
why would he pay you as well?

32:07.320 --> 32:09.185
He never did.
Ah.

32:11.390 --> 32:15.121
Do you... recognize this?

32:15.160 --> 32:16.957
No.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.991
It's bank records

32:19.030 --> 32:22.136
from an account_in _the name
of Loretta Krispinslq.

32:22.170 --> 32:24.206
That is your real
name, isn't it?

32:26.240 --> 32:28.231
Now, this
particular account

32:28.280 --> 32:29.702
was _closed
some time ago,

32:29.740 --> 32:31.298
but the transactions
are there.

32:31.350 --> 32:36.014
Repeated deposits
in the amount of $3,500.

32:36.050 --> 32:39.019
Now, these are
records from one

32:39.050 --> 32:40.586
of Mr. Florrick's
personal accounts,

32:40.620 --> 32:41.757
with corresponding
withdrawals

32:41.790 --> 32:44.486
in the same amount

32:44.530 --> 32:48.227
of $3,500.

32:48.260 --> 32:51.127
Always
within a day or two

32:51.170 --> 32:53.468
of when you
deposited the money.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.297
Now, I'm going to remind you
that you're under oath,

32:55.340 --> 32:58.138
Ms. Madison,
or should I say,

32:58.170 --> 33:00.730
Ms. Krispinsky?

33:00.770 --> 33:03.603
You were paid twice.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.676
Isn't that correct?
No.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.678
You were paid
by your procurers,

33:07.710 --> 33:09.610
who thought that
they were bribing Mr. Florrick

33:09.650 --> 33:12.710
for your services, and you
were also paid by Mr. Florrick,

33:12.750 --> 33:15.355
who didn't know that
you were being paid by others.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.255
Isn't that correct?

33:17.290 --> 33:19.758
You can make numbers look
like anything you want.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.350
Well, actually... you can't.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.597
I have no further questions
for this witness, Your Honor.

33:25.630 --> 33:29.066
I think we've had quite enough
of Amber Madison.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.509
CARY:
I've been going over the books

33:32.540 --> 33:35.077
Sweeney's wife demanded to see
the morning she disappeared,

33:35.110 --> 33:37.078
and look at this.

33:37.110 --> 33:39.078
Renmart? What's that?

33:39.110 --> 33:41.044
It's a dummy corporation
Charlotte Armitage set up.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.411
So I cross-referenced the books

33:42.450 --> 33:44.509
against the other discovery,
and look at this.

33:44.550 --> 33:47.519
Mariel Armitage has been
in rehab several times recently,

33:47.550 --> 33:50.485
all paid for
by her loving niece, Charlotte.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.728
Now, everybody thought
Carolyn was angry

33:53.760 --> 33:55.648
about the money
Sweeney had been Spending.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.089
Maybe she was really angry
at Charlotte.

34:01.670 --> 34:03.160
My relationship with my mother?

34:03.200 --> 34:04.337
She was my best friend.

34:04.370 --> 34:06.258
And can you tell me
what Renmart is?

34:07.370 --> 34:08.598
CROZIER:
Um...

34:08.640 --> 34:11.200
Your Honor, I think
I might have to object here.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.774
(door hinges squeak)
My only concern
is relevance.

34:12.810 --> 34:14.846
JUDGE:
Cory, I thought
we were gonna get

34:14.880 --> 34:16.711
some WD-40 on those hinges.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.381
Overruled.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.115
Your Honor...

34:21.160 --> 34:22.616
I said, overruled.

34:22.660 --> 34:24.184
WILL:
So, what is Renmart?

34:24.230 --> 34:27.119
It was a company I
started a few years ago.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.252
I live on a farm.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.326
I was going to market a line
of organic jams and jellies.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.429
And you withdrew
a fair amount of money

34:33.470 --> 34:35.529
from the family trust
to fund this

34:35.570 --> 34:37.333
fruit stand, didn't you?

34:37.370 --> 34:39.167
My mother okayed that.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.632
But even_ after
your mother disappeared,

34:40.670 --> 34:41.807
you continued withdrawing money,

34:41.840 --> 34:43.171
isn't that correct?

34:43.210 --> 34:44.802
Yet you never produced

34:44.850 --> 34:45.771
a Single jar ofjam.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.846
Your company has

34:47.880 --> 34:50.212
no physical address,
except a PO. box.

34:50.250 --> 34:53.287
No assets except a bank account
that you can access

34:53.320 --> 34:54.878
any time you'd like.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.684
Objection... Your Honor.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.789
On what grounds?

34:58.830 --> 35:01.355
Uh...

35:01.400 --> 35:03.356
Let me look here.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.220
Yeah, well,
while you're looking,

35:05.270 --> 35:06.521
overruled.

35:06.570 --> 35:07.867
WILL: _
You were sending
money away to your aunt

35:07.900 --> 35:09.765
in rehab, and you didn't want
your mother to know.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.462
That is not true.
So Carolyn was aware
you were doing this?

35:12.510 --> 35:13.807
No... I mean...

35:13.840 --> 35:15.376
No, not-not at first, but...

35:15.410 --> 35:17.435
And when She found out,
she was angry?

35:27.820 --> 35:28.889
KALIN DA:
A maggot?

35:28.920 --> 35:30.888
Not just any maggot.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.320
_ This little_ fellow
is usually found in rural areas,

35:33.360 --> 35:36.158
often near livestock,
but this

35:36.200 --> 35:38.919
was buried in the courtyard
of Sweeney's old apartment.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.359
What's even more unusual
is that it's here at all.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.539
Why wouldn't a maggot
be found on a corpse?

35:43.570 --> 35:46.164
Oh, it would, as long
as there was flesh to eat.

35:46.210 --> 35:49.737
But after two years, I'd expect
to find a clean Skull.

35:49.780 --> 35:53.568
A head with so much tissue
still preserved suggests

35:53.610 --> 35:56.875
contaminants in the soil--
usuaHylead

35:56.920 --> 35:58.888
or arsenic.

35:58.920 --> 36:02.287
Arsen_ic_ was used in
pestICIdes, right?

36:02.320 --> 36:04.652
Until they banned it
in the 19705.

36:04.690 --> 36:06.419
But if it was used before that,

36:06.460 --> 36:08.690
there'd still be concentrations
of it in the soil.

36:08.730 --> 36:11.597
Pesticides like
those used on a farm?

36:11.630 --> 36:13.621
Maybe. Why?

36:14.970 --> 36:16.938
Guess who lives on a farm

36:16.970 --> 36:18.858
in a rural area, near livestock?

36:18.910 --> 36:20.707
Don't tell me.
You're the killer.

36:20.740 --> 36:24.244
Thanks, Li.
You're a prince.

36:30.750 --> 36:33.241
(distant Siren wailing)

36:33.290 --> 36:36.782
(light rattling)

36:36.820 --> 36:39.459
(clattering)

36:39.490 --> 36:42.550
(distant Siren wailing)

36:42.600 --> 36:44.864
(thudding)

36:47.270 --> 36:49.329
(clattering)

36:56.740 --> 36:58.742
(Diane breathing rapidly)

37:09.460 --> 37:11.451
(clattering)

37:20.770 --> 37:22.567
(door creaking)

37:22.600 --> 37:24.636
(gasping)

37:29.080 --> 37:30.968
Oh! You...

37:33.450 --> 37:34.747
Oh...

37:34.780 --> 37:37.010
Oh, God.

37:37.050 --> 37:39.245
(dogs barking)

37:42.590 --> 37:43.579
(indistinct radio transmission)

37:43.620 --> 37:44.826
Found something!

37:46.090 --> 37:47.648
NEWSMAN:
The rest of Carolyn Armitage's

37:47.690 --> 37:49.999
remains were discovered buried

37:50.030 --> 37:51.520
behind the New Caledonia farm

37:51.570 --> 37:53.492
of Charlotte Armitage,
her daughter.

37:53.530 --> 37:56.988
Arrested at the scene
was Charlotte Armitage.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.338
Don't you see?! He set me up!

37:59.370 --> 38:00.837
I didn't... I didn't do this!

38:00.870 --> 38:02.303
He put her body here!

38:02.340 --> 38:04.308
He killed her for her money!

38:04.350 --> 38:05.977
He set me up! I didn't do it!

38:06.010 --> 38:08.319
Don't you... don't you see?!

38:08.350 --> 38:10.341
(car door closes)

38:16.060 --> 38:17.755
(door opens)

38:17.790 --> 38:20.281
Give us a moment, okay?

38:24.630 --> 38:26.996
Chicken sandwich?
No.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.776
I have an offer to make.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.937
I can't wait.

38:39.580 --> 38:42.117
I'll argue for your release
on humanitarian grounds.

38:42.150 --> 38:43.572
You should be home
with your family.

38:43.620 --> 38:44.780
Why would you do that?

38:44.820 --> 38:47.345
Because I'm a humanitarian.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.621
What's the catch?

38:51.660 --> 38:53.355
The catch is hardly
worthy of its name.

38:54.830 --> 38:56.889
The conviction stands.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.864
You know you DP'd
those cases, Peter.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.391
Now, it's just
you and I here.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.032
We can admit our feelings
to each other.

39:03.070 --> 39:05.903
You_want me to let
the gle verdict stand?
Yes.

39:05.940 --> 39:07.532
With time served,
you'd go home tomorrow.

39:07.570 --> 39:10.073
And my disbarment stands?
Yes.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.778
And I can never run against you?

39:12.810 --> 39:14.038
That's right.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.911
You have no chance, Peter.
You realize that.

39:15.950 --> 39:17.770
IfI have no chance,
what are you doing here?

39:17.820 --> 39:19.549
Okay, you know what?

39:19.590 --> 39:22.411
At a certain point, this has
to move beyond retribution.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.279
For both of us.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.753
You have to think
about your family

39:24.790 --> 39:26.849
or risk a failed appeal

39:26.890 --> 39:28.118
and another nine years
in prison,

39:28.160 --> 39:29.593
and how old will
you be then, Peter?

39:29.630 --> 39:31.996
How old will
your kids be?

39:32.030 --> 39:34.169
Birthday parties,
boyfriends,

39:34.200 --> 39:35.667
college graduations—-

39:35.700 --> 39:37.065
while you were
in prison.

39:37.100 --> 39:40.069
A life lived while
you grow old in prison.

39:40.110 --> 39:42.601
Now, that's the deal,
Peter: go home tomorrow

39:42.640 --> 39:46.007
or risk n_ine more
years in prison. Hmm?

39:51.180 --> 39:53.546
You think about it.

39:53.590 --> 39:56.787
(door opens, closes)

39:56.820 --> 39:58.788
DIANE:
I need you to take it.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.424
I don't feel...

40:01.460 --> 40:02.757
comfortable anymore.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.121
You can be made to
feel comfortable.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.967
I don't think so.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.137
You're scared of it?

40:09.170 --> 40:11.138
No.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.639
I'm liking it.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.149
I'll hold it for you.
No.

40:25.590 --> 40:26.887
I'll send you my bill.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.911
I expect no less.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.991
(door opens, closes)

40:41.600 --> 40:43.659
SWEENEY:
Mrs. Florrick.

40:44.870 --> 40:46.508
I brought you something.

40:46.540 --> 40:49.008
A token of my esteem.

40:56.950 --> 40:58.508
I thought it, somehow,

40:58.550 --> 41:00.586
strangely appropriate for you.

41:03.020 --> 41:04.214
You did it, didn't you?

41:04.260 --> 41:05.818
Did what?

41:05.860 --> 41:07.088
Killed her.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.085
Your wife.

41:08.130 --> 41:09.825
And then you

41:09.860 --> 41:11.225
buried her
in Charlotte's yard.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.592
IfI did that,

41:13.630 --> 41:16.531
why would I leave
the skull in my yard?

41:16.570 --> 41:17.992
To point us to Charlotte.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.508
You're being paranoid,
Mrs. Florrick.

41:20.540 --> 41:23.008
Sometimes things are
as they seem.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.077
The unlikely maneuver
is exactly that--

41:26.110 --> 41:27.771
unlikely.

41:30.050 --> 41:31.244
I have to go.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.679
Congratulations.

41:35.820 --> 41:38.983
You just have
to trust people.

41:41.030 --> 41:43.021
Enjoy the picture.
