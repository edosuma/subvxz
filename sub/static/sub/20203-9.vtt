00:05.739 --> 00:07.675
**

00:07.675 --> 00:10.511
It was 1975.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.647
After ten years,
the Vietnam War

00:13.647 --> 00:15.583
had finally
come to an end.

00:15.583 --> 00:20.388
* When I became of age,
my mama sat me down *

00:20.388 --> 00:22.290
But the nation was reeling

00:22.290 --> 00:24.192
from revelations
of corruption

00:24.192 --> 00:25.626
at the highest level
of government.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.062
I shall resign
the Presidency

00:28.062 --> 00:29.797
effective at noon
tomorrow.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.599
I was personally
struggling

00:31.599 --> 00:33.934
after the suicide
of my assistant

00:33.934 --> 00:37.138
and longtime friend,
Bobbie Arnstein.

00:37.138 --> 00:42.210
**

00:45.313 --> 00:48.482
* Hey, ooh,
what'll I do? *

00:48.482 --> 00:50.784
* Looks like
it's the end *

00:50.784 --> 00:53.554
Chicago was full
of painful memories,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.723
and my girlfriend
Barbi Benton

00:55.723 --> 00:57.858
had recently found
the perfect place for us

00:57.858 --> 01:01.829
on the West Coast,
so I decided it was time

01:01.829 --> 01:05.299
to permanently relocate.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.935
* When we party
get up *

01:07.935 --> 01:09.903
* We party *

01:09.903 --> 01:12.206
* Get on the groove
drop down *

01:12.206 --> 01:14.775
* Come on let's go *

01:14.775 --> 01:16.677
It wasn't long
before my new mansion,

01:16.677 --> 01:19.413
tucked away
near Beverly Hills,

01:19.413 --> 01:20.981
became a destination

01:20.981 --> 01:23.584
for Hollywood bigwigs
and movie stars.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.053
That was pretty much
legend, you know,

01:26.053 --> 01:27.621
I mean,
because he would invite

01:27.621 --> 01:32.160
all these beautiful girls
and all his friends.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.395
They'd, you know,
show first-run movies

01:34.395 --> 01:36.397
at the house and have
this wonderful banquet.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.532
The food was great
and it was like

01:38.532 --> 01:40.634
the greatest nightclub
in the world.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.069
**

01:42.069 --> 01:44.572
It's hard for me
to think of a celebrity

01:44.572 --> 01:46.807
who didn't come to one
of my parties back then.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.310
* Going through and through
and through and through *

01:49.310 --> 01:51.279
* Let's boogie down
until the end *

01:51.279 --> 01:53.381
New Year's Eve...

01:53.381 --> 01:54.382
Halloween...

01:56.550 --> 01:58.652
birthday parties...

01:58.652 --> 02:01.255
* Listen to the music
that we're playing *

02:01.255 --> 02:04.024
Each one was bigger
and better than the last.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.059
Some celebrities were
known to arrange

02:06.059 --> 02:08.896
their shooting schedules
around the parties

02:08.896 --> 02:10.398
just so they
wouldn't miss them.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.832
I flew into Los Angeles

02:11.832 --> 02:13.767
for something called
Midsummer Night's Dream.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.605
You had to dress either
in underwear or pajamas

02:17.605 --> 02:20.308
tight enough where they
can guess your religion.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.576
And when I walked into
the Playboy Mansion,

02:22.576 --> 02:24.578
it's everything
you could imagine.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.947
**

02:26.947 --> 02:28.582
* Gonna party *

02:28.582 --> 02:30.651
* We party hearty *

02:30.651 --> 02:32.586
* Hey let me
see you boogie *

02:32.586 --> 02:35.289
But the best part of
life at the new mansion

02:35.289 --> 02:37.090
was spending it
with Barbi.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.158
* Gonna party *

02:38.158 --> 02:40.160
* We party hearty *

02:40.160 --> 02:42.496
For nearly five years now,
we'd been inseparable...

02:42.496 --> 02:45.866
* We boogie woogie *

02:45.866 --> 02:47.568
..and she had become
a celebrity

02:47.568 --> 02:49.537
in her own right.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.004
Hi, happy
Hee Haw haystackers!

02:51.004 --> 02:53.707
I'm Barbi Benton,
and I'd like you to be

02:53.707 --> 02:55.443
in the haystack with me
this week

02:55.443 --> 02:56.810
on the old Hee Haw.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.712
**

02:58.712 --> 03:00.214
Barbi started out

03:00.214 --> 03:02.883
taking on
small acting roles,

03:02.883 --> 03:05.319
appearing on notable
TV shows like Hee Haw

03:05.319 --> 03:07.755
and The Love Boat.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.390
**

03:09.390 --> 03:13.361
* I want to spend my life
with a girl like you *

03:13.361 --> 03:15.028
But what Barbi
really wanted

03:15.028 --> 03:18.165
was to pursue something
she'd always dreamed of,

03:18.165 --> 03:20.000
a career in music.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.970
* All the things
that you want me to *

03:22.970 --> 03:26.039
I'd recently started
my own record label.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.475
We didn't start out

03:27.475 --> 03:29.610
with very many
recognizable artists,

03:29.610 --> 03:31.645
but we did release
an early record

03:31.645 --> 03:34.582
by a little-known
group from Sweden

03:34.582 --> 03:37.718
who would later be known
to the world as ABBA.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.953
* Ba ba ba ba ba
ba ba ba ba *

03:44.692 --> 03:48.195
**

03:48.195 --> 03:52.733
* She outgrew brass
buckles on her shoes *

03:52.733 --> 03:57.705
* By 12, she was
filling out her jeans *

03:57.705 --> 04:00.274
After hearing her sing,

04:00.274 --> 04:01.742
I decided to sign Barbi

04:01.742 --> 04:03.411
as one of
my first artists.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.613
* Do anything *

04:05.613 --> 04:07.548
* She was old enough
to try *

04:07.548 --> 04:09.517
Well, I was flattered

04:09.517 --> 04:11.819
that he asked me
to be on the label.

04:11.819 --> 04:14.688
It was important to me
that he asked.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.024
I would have been
disappointed

04:17.024 --> 04:20.160
if he had just let me go
to another record label

04:20.160 --> 04:23.564
and not said anything.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.999
* She outgrew brass
buckles on her shoes *

04:25.999 --> 04:29.803
In 1975,
Barbi's first single,

04:29.803 --> 04:32.440
Brass Buckles, broke
onto the top ten

04:32.440 --> 04:34.207
on the Billboard
Country Charts.

04:34.207 --> 04:37.311
Barbi Benton's career
definitely took off.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.781
She was creating
a career in her own right

04:40.781 --> 04:43.851
and he wanted her
to be successful

04:43.851 --> 04:49.022
in her chosen profession
and helped her along.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.123
* She outgrew... *

04:50.123 --> 04:51.525
Barbi's success

04:51.525 --> 04:53.727
was an exciting time
for both of us,

04:53.727 --> 04:56.797
but I didn't realize
that the life we shared

04:56.797 --> 05:00.133
was about to change
forever.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.937
* Every little movement *

05:03.937 --> 05:08.208
* Every little thing
you do *

05:08.208 --> 05:10.878
* Is it sleight of hand *

05:10.878 --> 05:15.883
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

05:15.883 --> 05:19.820
* Every little movement *

05:19.820 --> 05:23.824
* Every
little movement **

05:23.824 --> 05:26.026
**

05:27.160 --> 05:29.229
**

05:29.229 --> 05:31.899
With Barbi's career
taking off,

05:31.899 --> 05:34.968
she was spending
more time away on tour,

05:34.968 --> 05:38.005
leaving me alone
in the mansion...

05:38.005 --> 05:41.909
**

05:41.909 --> 05:44.678
so I filled my nights
with people,

05:44.678 --> 05:50.183
parties and, soon, women.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.686
There were periods in
the very beginning with Barbi,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.021
and that's what
the relationship was,

05:54.021 --> 05:54.922
essentially monogamous,

05:54.922 --> 05:56.289
because we were
traveling together

05:56.289 --> 05:58.426
and spending all
of our time together.

05:58.426 --> 06:01.228
But we were separated
for a lot of the time.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.464
**

06:03.464 --> 06:06.400
There was
a continuing string

06:06.400 --> 06:08.235
of new women in my life.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.539
After all,
from the point of view

06:11.539 --> 06:13.574
of the editor/publisher
of the magazine,

06:13.574 --> 06:16.510
one of the wonders
of what I invented was,

06:16.510 --> 06:18.679
after February
there is March.

06:18.679 --> 06:22.015
After March,
there is April.

06:22.015 --> 06:25.385
And it supplied

06:25.385 --> 06:29.022
more than just
a very tempting lifestyle

06:29.022 --> 06:31.324
and I succumbed to it
without much trouble.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.193
* Heaven *

06:33.193 --> 06:35.463
* I'm in heaven *

06:38.031 --> 06:39.332
Morning, Bob.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.367
Hef.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.635
Dick.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.176
Thank you.

06:50.778 --> 06:54.582
So, uh, we just
got the quarterlies in

06:54.582 --> 06:56.717
and, uh,
it's not good news.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.587
Well, we knew sales couldn't
keep climbing forever.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.422
Over 20 years on the rise
isn't a bad run.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.159
It's worse than that.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.061
What do you mean?

07:08.061 --> 07:10.964
We posted a loss.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.768
How far does that mean
magazine sales fell?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.404
It's not just
the magazine.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.172
It's the company.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.809
The whole company's
posted a loss.

07:21.809 --> 07:26.013
We've got problems,
Hef. Major problems.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.420
How did this happen?

07:33.420 --> 07:37.491
Playboy had
overextended itself.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.259
**

07:39.259 --> 07:42.195
As our success grew,
we'd expanded our brand

07:42.195 --> 07:44.898
by taking on new
business ventures...

07:44.898 --> 07:45.766
Action.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.569
Oh, shit, guys.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.170
That's the place
we quit.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.073
Every time,
something breaks.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.943
...including
a production company,

07:55.943 --> 08:00.914
the music label,
a publishing company,

08:00.914 --> 08:02.716
a limousine service,

08:02.716 --> 08:05.385
and dozens
of other ventures,

08:05.385 --> 08:08.989
and now they were
all losing money.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.091
That sense of identification

08:11.091 --> 08:14.762
that was so strong between
consumers and Playboy

08:14.762 --> 08:17.264
was really
what gave it permission

08:17.264 --> 08:19.833
to go into
other businesses.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.735
Having said that,
the challenge is,

08:21.735 --> 08:24.404
you still have to
manage those businesses,

08:24.404 --> 08:28.876
and in Playboy's case,
the businesses might have

08:28.876 --> 08:30.944
logically fit
under the brand,

08:30.944 --> 08:34.915
but the company didn't have
the competitive expertise

08:34.915 --> 08:37.317
and depth of management
to be successful

08:37.317 --> 08:38.952
in so many
different businesses.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.354
To make matters worse,

08:41.354 --> 08:46.994
our once loyal readers
were starting to drift.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.930
**

08:53.133 --> 08:56.003
* Back at it Sally *

08:56.003 --> 08:59.206
In 1975,
there were almost 40

08:59.206 --> 09:01.842
nationally-distributed
men's magazines,

09:01.842 --> 09:05.345
and they were starting to
cut into our market.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.914
**

09:06.914 --> 09:09.583
The biggest of them all
was Penthouse.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.719
**

09:11.719 --> 09:13.286
For years now,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.388
Penthouse had been
trying to one-up Playboy

09:15.388 --> 09:18.258
by showing more and more
explicit photos.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.960
**

09:19.960 --> 09:25.398
But, by 1975, they had
taken it to a new level.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.735
**

09:27.735 --> 09:29.269
Penthouse
was showing pictures

09:29.269 --> 09:31.438
of men and women
together.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.273
**

09:33.273 --> 09:34.541
Threesomes...

09:34.541 --> 09:36.576
**

09:36.576 --> 09:40.013
Lesbian scenes...

09:40.013 --> 09:43.216
They went so far as to
put nudity on the cover,

09:43.216 --> 09:45.218
even though that
meant it couldn't be

09:45.218 --> 09:47.855
fully displayed
on newsstands.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.790
* Ooh baby
I'm calling your bluff *

09:49.790 --> 09:53.293
And finally, they showed
full male nudity,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.796
the first mainstream
magazine to do so.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.831
* Yes I do *

09:57.831 --> 10:01.201
I remember opening
the first copy of Penthouse

10:01.201 --> 10:03.470
that I ever saw,
and I said aloud,

10:03.470 --> 10:05.639
this guy
is photographing sex.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.507
We are
photographing pinups.

10:07.507 --> 10:11.078
It was simply
more lubricious.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.547
It was a better job
of the fantasy

10:14.547 --> 10:15.949
that the person
you were looking at

10:15.949 --> 10:17.951
was available to you,

10:17.951 --> 10:20.921
that you might
actually have sex.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.723
* Well whoo *

10:22.723 --> 10:26.694
**

10:28.662 --> 10:30.230
What do you think?

10:30.230 --> 10:34.001
Well, I know it's
gonna make headlines.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.136
Art says
it's going too far.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.672
It probably is,
for some people.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.041
So you say go for it?

10:41.041 --> 10:43.944
Yeah.

10:46.279 --> 10:50.017
**

10:50.017 --> 10:52.019
I had always
remained adamant

10:52.019 --> 10:53.520
that Playboy's photos

10:53.520 --> 10:56.289
would leave something
to the imagination,

10:56.289 --> 11:00.060
but with the magazine's
finances in jeopardy,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.129
I felt I had no choice

11:02.129 --> 11:04.898
but to match
the competition.

11:04.898 --> 11:08.068
* My heart is aching,
yeah *

11:08.068 --> 11:10.503
* I feel so sad now *

11:10.503 --> 11:11.839
* I'm in a world of... *

11:11.839 --> 11:14.307
In November of 1975,

11:14.307 --> 11:18.145
Playboy published its
most explicit cover ever.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.612
* This is the way,
yeah *

11:19.612 --> 11:21.381
* This is the way *

11:21.381 --> 11:25.986
Now, the famous cover,
her hand in her panties,

11:25.986 --> 11:29.089
I think he was very
reluctant to print it,

11:29.089 --> 11:32.459
but we got mentioned
in all of the stories,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.294
which was the whole point.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.063
The controversy
surrounding the cover

11:36.063 --> 11:38.732
did sell magazines,
but not everyone

11:38.732 --> 11:41.101
was happy
with my strategy.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.870
**

11:42.870 --> 11:46.774
The advertisers
are upset.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.242
About?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.044
Well, it seems
every month,

11:51.044 --> 11:52.312
you're showing
more and more.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.481
It's getting more
and more explicit.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.017
And now this cover...
They are not happy.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.822
Playboy had spent decades

12:01.822 --> 12:03.623
building up
a sophisticated image

12:03.623 --> 12:06.526
that attracted
high-end advertisers.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.461
With the Playboy empire

12:08.461 --> 12:10.497
already in
financial trouble,

12:10.497 --> 12:14.234
we couldn't afford to
lose our ad revenue too.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.905
I think that the time
that Hefner decided

12:17.905 --> 12:20.673
to publish photos
of a woman masturbating

12:20.673 --> 12:22.309
was probably more
commercial than it was

12:22.309 --> 12:26.113
taking a stand about
any particular issue,

12:26.113 --> 12:27.614
and I think that's
a really fine line to take.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.582
I think occasionally
magazines

12:29.582 --> 12:31.985
can generate
so much controversy

12:31.985 --> 12:35.088
that they create a lot
of noise around themselves,

12:35.088 --> 12:37.424
but often, that can create

12:37.424 --> 12:40.527
much more long-term harm
than anything else.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.495
Thanks.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.389
Tammy...

13:09.389 --> 13:11.324
Linda...

13:12.792 --> 13:13.894
You're back.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.562
Just got in.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.999
How was Nashville?

13:18.999 --> 13:21.902
Fine. Hot.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.239
Barbi...

13:26.239 --> 13:27.807
Look, this doesn't
have to be

13:27.807 --> 13:29.076
some big conversation.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.379
It doesn't have to be
a conversation at all.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.949
Yes, it does.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.684
You know I love you.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.852
I know.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.520
You know I don't
ever want to hurt you.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.989
I know.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.658
It's just...

13:45.658 --> 13:50.363
Hef, this place
is a dream,

13:50.363 --> 13:53.833
but it's your dream.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.904
**

14:03.543 --> 14:05.678
* Daddy *

14:05.678 --> 14:07.614
**

14:07.614 --> 14:10.417
* Won't you buy *

14:10.417 --> 14:14.387
* That pretty dolly
for me? *

14:14.387 --> 14:16.323
I think it was
very hard on Hef

14:16.323 --> 14:20.393
when I became a performer
and went on tour

14:20.393 --> 14:25.098
because I was gone a lot,
and he was lonesome,

14:25.098 --> 14:31.371
so even though I was
expected to be honorable,

14:31.371 --> 14:36.409
he kind of had
that double standard

14:36.409 --> 14:39.046
and I wouldn't
put up with it.

14:39.046 --> 14:43.450
Eventually,
that was our demise.

14:43.450 --> 14:47.754
**

14:47.754 --> 14:51.058
* That sad old man *

14:51.058 --> 14:52.825
When he was with
Barbi Benton,

14:52.825 --> 14:54.261
I know that
he's often said

14:54.261 --> 14:56.896
that was the most
romantic time of his life.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.266
It's no secret
that one of the things

14:59.266 --> 15:02.402
that split Barbi and Hef up

15:02.402 --> 15:05.372
was the fact
that he had a hard time,

15:05.372 --> 15:07.740
at that time in his life,
being monogamous.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.177
But they have stayed very
close friends over the years,

15:10.177 --> 15:13.480
and I know they still
love each other very much.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.020
Barbi was gone

15:20.020 --> 15:23.023
and I felt
more alone than ever

15:23.023 --> 15:26.960
at the head of a magazine
that was falling apart.

15:26.960 --> 15:32.165
I suddenly felt like
I stood to lose everything...

15:33.800 --> 15:39.406
so I did something I had
resisted for a long time.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.341
I brought in an outsider
to serve as president

15:41.341 --> 15:45.212
and chief operating officer
of the business

15:45.212 --> 15:47.380
named Derick Daniels.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.784
Hefner had felt we needed
a serious and qualified

15:51.784 --> 15:53.286
president of the company.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.655
We hired Derick Daniels.

15:55.655 --> 16:00.127
He ran the Miami Herald
and TheDetroit Free Press

16:00.127 --> 16:03.830
and was considered
well qualified for the job

16:03.830 --> 16:05.598
and well known.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.700
Daniels' first order
of business

16:07.700 --> 16:09.302
was trimming the fat.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.871
He got Playboy
out of the movie business,

16:11.871 --> 16:16.676
closed eight clubs,
and cut payroll by 10%.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.346
With Daniels on top
of the finances,

16:19.346 --> 16:21.914
I was freed up to take
stock of the magazine.

16:21.914 --> 16:26.553
Even though our risqué
cover had given us a boost,

16:26.553 --> 16:29.456
by the end of the year,
our overall readership

16:29.456 --> 16:31.791
was down 2 million
from its peak

16:31.791 --> 16:35.062
and ad revenues
were down nearly 8%.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.629
I realized the only way

16:36.629 --> 16:38.765
we were going to
beat Penthouse

16:38.765 --> 16:43.636
was to concentrate
on what we did best.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.473
We focused on
sophisticated content,

16:46.473 --> 16:49.809
running the work of great
writers like Norman Mailer

16:49.809 --> 16:51.778
and Kurt Vonnegut...

16:51.778 --> 16:53.513
**

16:53.513 --> 16:56.649
...continuing our tradition
of uncensored interviews

16:56.649 --> 16:58.951
with celebrities
like David Bowie

16:58.951 --> 17:00.487
and Elton John...

17:00.487 --> 17:03.756
* The way the world is,
get just what you can *

17:03.756 --> 17:06.159
And reflecting what
America was talking about.

17:06.159 --> 17:12.365
* Tomorrow, riddled
as a man yeah yeah yeah *

17:12.365 --> 17:15.535
1976 was an election year.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.837
After losing faith
in Richard Nixon

17:17.837 --> 17:19.406
and the Republican
establishment

17:19.406 --> 17:21.174
two years earlier,

17:21.174 --> 17:23.643
many Americans were
looking for a candidate

17:23.643 --> 17:26.313
who could bring about
change in Washington.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.115
One of
the surprise frontrunners

17:28.115 --> 17:30.450
was a peanut farmer
from Georgia

17:30.450 --> 17:32.185
who was
pretty much unknown

17:32.185 --> 17:34.487
before the
Democratic primary.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.590
His name was Jimmy Carter.

17:37.590 --> 17:41.128
1976, Jimmy Carter, going
into the general election

17:41.128 --> 17:43.196
against the sitting
President Gerald Ford.

17:43.196 --> 17:47.367
But Carter was
an Evangelical Baptist

17:47.367 --> 17:50.403
who would occasionally say
that he was born again.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.272
There was a great fear

17:52.272 --> 17:55.308
that he's going to take
his religious values

17:55.308 --> 17:59.546
and now impose them
on the American public.

17:59.546 --> 18:03.082
To counteract that,
Carter's advisors convinced him

18:03.082 --> 18:05.285
to do this interview
for Playboy.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.987
* Everybody knows
everybody goes *

18:07.987 --> 18:10.823
* Make a buck today *

18:10.823 --> 18:14.361
Jimmy Carter
interview, 1976.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.263
The reason it was
such a big deal

18:16.263 --> 18:18.298
is that
a presidential candidate

18:18.298 --> 18:23.470
openly discussed lust
in Playboy magazine.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.873
The media made it
the deal that it was.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.375
We didn't know
how that line,

18:28.375 --> 18:30.777
"adultery in my heart,"
was gonna play,

18:30.777 --> 18:34.581
but that issue
sold 98% at the newsstand.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.516
* Get just what you can *

18:36.516 --> 18:38.718
* Wake up again tomorrow *

18:38.718 --> 18:43.156
No magazine had ever sold
98% at the newsstand before.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.091
**

18:45.091 --> 18:46.793
While everyone
was talking about

18:46.793 --> 18:48.695
what was inside
the magazine,

18:48.695 --> 18:51.631
we also redoubled our
effortsto make Playboy

18:51.631 --> 18:53.933
a force for social
good in the world.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.437
Good evening. In Saigon,
tearful farewells,

18:57.437 --> 18:59.071
but the promise
of a better life

18:59.071 --> 19:01.208
as hundreds of
Vietnamese orphans

19:01.208 --> 19:02.509
today began their journey

19:02.509 --> 19:04.677
toward new homes
in the United States.

19:04.677 --> 19:09.349
* Love is all around me
and so the feeling grows *

19:09.349 --> 19:13.820
The Vietnam war officially
ended in April of 1975,

19:13.820 --> 19:17.690
but it left a humanitarian
crisis in its wake

19:17.690 --> 19:21.160
and I wanted Playboy to
do what it could to help.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.898
I deployed The Big Bunny
and dozens of jet bunnies

19:25.898 --> 19:30.803
to fly Vietnamese orphans
to their new foster homes.

19:30.803 --> 19:36.008
* My mind is made up
by the way that I feel *

19:36.008 --> 19:41.614
In San Francisco, we met
the children with our plane

19:41.614 --> 19:45.618
and they were flown to
various cities in this country.

19:45.618 --> 19:48.255
It was a Playboy baby lift.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.523
* It's written
on the wind *

19:50.523 --> 19:51.924
* It's everywhere I go *

19:51.924 --> 19:53.460
I also wanted to give back

19:53.460 --> 19:56.028
to my new adopted home
of Los Angeles

19:56.028 --> 19:57.564
and the movie industry

19:57.564 --> 20:00.933
that had inspired me
since I was a kid...

20:00.933 --> 20:03.470
**

20:03.470 --> 20:05.672
...so I threw
a fundraiser at the mansion

20:05.672 --> 20:08.808
to preserve
a Hollywood landmark.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.944
* Love sweet love
won't you be good to me? *

20:11.944 --> 20:14.914
The Hollywood sign
was in decay in the '70s,

20:14.914 --> 20:16.783
and he had a fundraiser here.

20:16.783 --> 20:21.321
Lucille Ball, Alice Cooper
both donated money

20:21.321 --> 20:24.056
to have it rebuilt.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.628
* Anybody down
to party down tonight? *

20:28.628 --> 20:34.033
To him, the Hollywood sign
is our Statue of Liberty

20:34.033 --> 20:37.069
or our Eiffel Tower
and what that represents.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.105
**

20:39.105 --> 20:42.775
I felt like Playboy
was getting back on track.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.845
But while our other
ventures may have wavered,

20:45.845 --> 20:48.948
one part of the company
was still thriving.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.082
**

20:50.082 --> 20:52.018
* Get on down *

20:52.018 --> 20:54.821
Victor Lownes'
casino in London.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.690
**

21:03.963 --> 21:05.097
* Get up *

21:05.097 --> 21:07.266
**

21:07.266 --> 21:08.568
Thanks to a weak pound

21:08.568 --> 21:10.102
and steady stream
of oil money

21:10.102 --> 21:12.572
from Middle Eastern sheiks
and businessmen...

21:12.572 --> 21:14.240
* Gotta get up *

21:14.240 --> 21:16.075
...the casino
was bringing in

21:16.075 --> 21:17.477
$26 million annually.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.778
* Get on down *

21:18.778 --> 21:20.146
**

21:20.146 --> 21:24.116
* Gotta get up, gotta
get up, gotta get up *

21:24.116 --> 21:25.785
* Sit on down *

21:25.785 --> 21:28.421
The money that we made
here in London

21:28.421 --> 21:31.458
was supporting the
entire Playboy operation.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.659
**

21:32.659 --> 21:33.960
* Sit on down *

21:33.960 --> 21:36.929
**

21:36.929 --> 21:40.500
Playboy editorial could
get better contributors

21:40.500 --> 21:43.803
as a result,
just with the extra money

21:43.803 --> 21:47.574
that we were plowing
into the main office.

21:47.574 --> 21:50.577
With the success
of the London casino,

21:50.577 --> 21:52.812
Victor began to believe
the rest of Playboy

21:52.812 --> 21:54.447
could recover financially

21:54.447 --> 21:55.982
if we could
duplicate the formula

21:55.982 --> 22:00.687
that worked in London
here in the U.S.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.823
And he knew just
the place to do it.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.825
**

22:05.825 --> 22:07.460
Atlantic City.

22:07.460 --> 22:11.097
**

22:11.097 --> 22:13.299
* Deep in the jungle
where the coconuts grow *

22:13.299 --> 22:15.001
Gambling had
only been legalized

22:14.370 --> 22:17.840
in Atlantic City
since 1974,

22:17.840 --> 22:20.709
and developers were
already buying up land

22:20.709 --> 22:23.679
and starting to build
a casino and resort strip

22:23.679 --> 22:25.581
to rival Las Vegas.

22:25.581 --> 22:29.318
* A monkey over here
monkey over there *

22:29.318 --> 22:31.520
I think it was almost
a natural that Hugh Hefner

22:31.520 --> 22:33.455
would look at Atlantic City
as a great opportunity

22:33.455 --> 22:37.760
to help revive the Playboy
Enterprises company.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.661
The idea was,
we can bring in

22:39.661 --> 22:41.597
a high clientele
of gamblers,

22:41.597 --> 22:43.499
just the way they had
in England,

22:43.499 --> 22:47.436
by offering up this
kind of Playboy experience

22:47.436 --> 22:50.006
and, you know, bringing it
to the Jersey shore.

22:50.006 --> 22:53.810
It's just that I think we
have a real opportunity here.

22:53.810 --> 22:55.577
We have the chance
to establish ourselves

22:55.577 --> 22:58.280
as the premiere casino
in all of the East Coast.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.182
And you don't
anticipate any issues

23:00.182 --> 23:03.585
managing Atlantic City
and London at the same time?

23:03.585 --> 23:04.686
Not at all.

23:04.686 --> 23:05.721
But we do
run the risk

23:05.721 --> 23:07.523
of you being
stretched thin,

23:07.523 --> 23:08.891
and from my experience,

23:08.891 --> 23:10.026
that can lead
to oversights.

23:10.026 --> 23:11.928
Look, Daniels,

23:11.928 --> 23:13.362
I've been doing this
for a while now,

23:13.362 --> 23:16.032
and you're
the new guy, okay?

23:16.032 --> 23:18.367
So, why don't
you just focus

23:18.367 --> 23:20.736
on getting everything
on your end taken care of

23:20.736 --> 23:22.638
and I'll take care
of mine.

23:22.638 --> 23:24.941
How about that?

23:24.941 --> 23:26.809
Victor hasn't
let us down yet.

23:26.809 --> 23:29.812
And I don't intend to.

23:29.812 --> 23:33.782
Fine. I'll get
the ball rolling.

23:33.782 --> 23:35.117
Thanks.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.695
While Victor and
Daniels got started

23:46.695 --> 23:49.098
on our biggest casino yet,

23:49.098 --> 23:51.968
I turned my attention
to an upcoming milestone

23:51.968 --> 23:54.536
for the magazine...

23:54.536 --> 23:57.406
**

24:03.712 --> 24:05.882
...our 25th anniversary.

24:05.882 --> 24:08.951
**

24:11.220 --> 24:13.856
Our January 1979 issue

24:13.856 --> 24:16.225
reflected how far
we'd come

24:16.225 --> 24:19.361
both as a magazine
and as a culture,

24:19.361 --> 24:23.365
from our 1953 cover
with Marilyn Monroe,

24:23.365 --> 24:27.669
when no one was
even talking about sex,

24:27.669 --> 24:30.039
to our fight in court
for freedom of speech

24:30.039 --> 24:31.740
over Jayne Mansfield's
photos,

24:31.740 --> 24:36.078
and our coverage of
civil rights in Vietnam.

24:36.078 --> 24:38.214
The 25th anniversary issue

24:38.214 --> 24:40.049
featured articles
by famous writers

24:40.049 --> 24:44.153
like Shel Silverstein
and Gore Vidal

24:44.153 --> 24:47.289
and an in-depth interview
with Marlon Brando,

24:47.289 --> 24:48.991
but the real centerpiece

24:48.991 --> 24:51.427
of our 25th
anniversary celebration

24:51.427 --> 24:54.030
was The Great
Playmate Hunt.

24:54.030 --> 24:57.099
**

25:02.738 --> 25:05.841
* Never had the pleasure *

25:05.841 --> 25:09.545
* Of loving you *

25:09.545 --> 25:11.513
Over the course
of six months,

25:11.513 --> 25:14.683
we sent out photographers
to 28 American cities

25:14.683 --> 25:17.119
in search of
the most beautiful women

25:17.119 --> 25:18.654
across the country.

25:18.654 --> 25:22.524
* You're everything
that I desire *

25:22.524 --> 25:24.093
The result
was a pictorial

25:24.093 --> 25:26.795
featuring our
16 gorgeous finalists.

25:26.795 --> 25:28.430
**

25:28.430 --> 25:33.235
* All because
you're so unique baby *

25:33.235 --> 25:37.173
* I can't help
but love you girl *

25:37.173 --> 25:40.977
* None can compete
girl with you *

25:40.977 --> 25:43.179
* You *

25:43.179 --> 25:44.380
* Oh oh *

25:44.380 --> 25:45.914
* Ah *

25:45.914 --> 25:49.918
And the winner
of our $25,000 prize

25:49.918 --> 25:53.622
was a 23-year-old
Oklahoma college student

25:53.622 --> 25:55.924
named Candy Stanton.

25:55.924 --> 26:00.997
**

26:02.698 --> 26:05.801
We threw a giant party
to celebrate...

26:05.801 --> 26:09.238
**

26:09.238 --> 26:12.441
...inviting movie stars,

26:12.441 --> 26:16.045
along with much of
Playboy's original staff...

26:16.045 --> 26:17.313
**

26:17.313 --> 26:19.848
...like my old friends
Eldon Sellers

26:19.848 --> 26:21.417
and Vince Tajiri.

26:21.417 --> 26:25.454
Even former Playmate
Janet Pilgrim was on hand.

26:25.454 --> 26:28.024
But the girl that
caught my eye that night

26:28.024 --> 26:29.758
wasn't the winner
of the hunt...

26:29.758 --> 26:31.093
Hi.

26:31.093 --> 26:32.728
...but the runner-up.

26:32.728 --> 26:34.463
Hi.

26:34.463 --> 26:37.766
A 19-year-old
named Dorothy Stratten.

26:37.766 --> 26:39.868
Pictures didn't
do you justice.

26:39.868 --> 26:41.137
Looking at you now,

26:41.137 --> 26:42.971
I don't see
how you didn't win.

26:42.971 --> 26:45.474
Oh. It was
just an honor

26:45.474 --> 26:47.243
to make it
as far as I did.

26:47.243 --> 26:51.080
All of this,
it's incredible

26:51.080 --> 26:52.914
and a little
overwhelming,

26:52.914 --> 26:54.083
to be honest.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.317
Well, you'll have
plenty of time

26:55.317 --> 26:57.053
to get used to it.
I have a feeling

26:57.053 --> 26:58.554
you're gonna
be here a lot.

26:58.554 --> 27:01.357
**

27:01.357 --> 27:04.760
* You're up on
your feet now baby *

27:04.760 --> 27:06.195
**

27:06.195 --> 27:08.664
Dorothy Stratten
was a beautiful,

27:08.664 --> 27:13.135
phenomenal blonde who
came into Playboy's life.

27:13.135 --> 27:15.337
* I know *

27:15.337 --> 27:22.844
She was striking in the most
old-fashioned movie star.

27:22.844 --> 27:24.313
You couldn't believe

27:24.313 --> 27:26.482
that someone was
put together like this.

27:26.482 --> 27:30.519
* Since the day
I met you *

27:30.519 --> 27:32.854
As a young girl,
Dorothy was raised

27:32.854 --> 27:36.024
in a broken home
in Vancouver, Canada.

27:36.024 --> 27:39.128
Dorothy Stratten
grew up in a family

27:39.128 --> 27:42.798
with a single mom
raising three kids.

27:42.798 --> 27:44.933
She worked behind the counter
at the Dairy Queen.

27:44.933 --> 27:47.203
**

27:47.203 --> 27:49.071
It hadn't been
Dorothy's idea

27:49.071 --> 27:51.107
to enter
The Playmate Hunt.

27:51.107 --> 27:54.110
It was her boyfriend,
a man named Paul Snider,

27:54.110 --> 27:55.644
nine years older than her,

27:55.644 --> 27:58.347
who had sent us
her pictures.

27:58.347 --> 28:00.982
Paul Snider
would recruit women

28:00.982 --> 28:03.552
to model in car shows.

28:03.552 --> 28:06.222
He was just trying to
hustle any way he could

28:06.222 --> 28:07.523
to get beautiful women,

28:07.523 --> 28:10.226
so he walked
into the Dairy Queen,

28:10.226 --> 28:11.693
saw Dorothy, you know,

28:11.693 --> 28:13.695
this beautiful woman
behind the counter,

28:13.695 --> 28:15.397
and thought, you know,

28:15.397 --> 28:17.266
this girl is
the girl next door.

28:17.266 --> 28:20.502
Dorothy married Paul

28:20.502 --> 28:23.004
and brought him
with her to L.A.

28:23.004 --> 28:26.308
**

28:35.184 --> 28:37.553
In August of 1979,

28:37.553 --> 28:40.622
we made Dorothy
Playmate of the Month.

28:40.622 --> 28:42.724
**

28:42.724 --> 28:45.594
Her pictorial became
a favorite with readers.

28:45.594 --> 28:51.133
**

28:51.133 --> 28:52.501
We began featuring her

28:52.501 --> 28:54.770
in Playboy
television specials.

28:54.770 --> 28:56.004
Hey, Dorothy's coming.

28:56.004 --> 28:59.908
I'll bet you $100 she'll
pretend not to see me.

28:59.908 --> 29:03.212
She was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

29:03.212 --> 29:06.548
I was convinced
that in Vancouver,

29:06.548 --> 29:08.184
you know, there's
some mad scientist

29:08.184 --> 29:10.352
working on some kind
of beauty pill.

29:10.352 --> 29:12.854
It was just mindboggling.

29:12.854 --> 29:16.091
**

29:16.091 --> 29:19.094
Her charisma
was undeniable...

29:19.094 --> 29:22.063
**

29:22.063 --> 29:24.533
...and Dorothy soon
used her Playboy celebrity

29:24.533 --> 29:27.169
to start an acting career.

29:27.169 --> 29:31.907
**

29:31.907 --> 29:35.544
Over the next few months,
Dorothy was cast in roles

29:35.544 --> 29:38.247
on the hit TV show
Buck Rogers,

29:38.247 --> 29:40.382
Fantasy Island,

29:40.382 --> 29:43.219
and in the sci-fi movie
Galaxina.

29:43.219 --> 29:45.854
**

29:45.854 --> 29:47.623
But her big break came

29:47.623 --> 29:50.091
when Oscar-winning director
Peter Bogdanovich

29:50.091 --> 29:53.429
cast her in his new movie,
They All Laughed,

29:53.429 --> 29:56.465
alongside John Ritter,
Ben Gazzara,

29:56.465 --> 29:58.133
and Audrey Hepburn.

29:58.133 --> 29:59.768
**

30:01.670 --> 30:03.839
And now, it gives me
a great deal of pleasure

30:03.839 --> 30:07.343
to welcome all of you
here for the presentation

30:07.343 --> 30:09.678
of our 1980
Playmate of the Year,

30:09.678 --> 30:12.581
and she is something
rather special,

30:12.581 --> 30:14.983
Canadian-born
Dorothy Stratten.

30:14.983 --> 30:16.285
Dorothy, you want to
come up here?

30:21.690 --> 30:25.627
I'm sure that this has
been many a girl's dream

30:25.627 --> 30:28.897
and certainly many of
the Playmates' dream,

30:28.897 --> 30:30.332
and it's been mine.

30:32.634 --> 30:35.737
Dorothy's star
was on the rise...

30:35.737 --> 30:37.038
**

30:37.038 --> 30:38.740
...but no one suspected

30:38.740 --> 30:43.912
that her personal life
would begin to haunt her.

30:43.912 --> 30:45.914
What is it?

30:45.914 --> 30:48.584
Uh, it's Paul.

30:48.584 --> 30:51.520
He's at the front gate,
demanding to be let in.

30:51.520 --> 30:55.857
Oh, my gosh. I told him
this was just...

30:55.857 --> 30:57.826
Is he causing
a scene or...?

30:57.826 --> 30:59.261
No, they would have
called the police.

30:59.261 --> 31:00.629
He's just
refusing to leave.

31:00.629 --> 31:02.898
Dorothy, if you
need me to do anything...

31:02.898 --> 31:04.800
No, no. It's fine.

31:05.867 --> 31:08.904
Here is this guy
that discovered her,

31:08.904 --> 31:12.974
and all of a sudden,
now she's in movies.

31:12.974 --> 31:17.145
She's Playmate of the Year.
Her career is blossoming.

31:17.145 --> 31:18.680
**

31:18.680 --> 31:22.384
I think he started
really losing it

31:22.384 --> 31:24.820
and getting paranoid
like he's losing her.

31:26.522 --> 31:28.857
I was proud of Dorothy

31:28.857 --> 31:30.926
and glad she was
leaving for New York

31:30.926 --> 31:36.432
to shoot Bogdanovich's
film without Paul.

31:36.432 --> 31:37.933
Let's hear it
for Hef! Hey!

31:40.669 --> 31:42.471
Around the same time,

31:42.471 --> 31:44.473
one of my own dreams
was coming true.

31:44.473 --> 31:46.542
We have a ceremony today

31:46.542 --> 31:50.211
for the 1,716th star

31:50.211 --> 31:52.213
to be placed
in the Walk of Fame.

31:56.685 --> 31:58.820
Those of you
who know me best

31:58.820 --> 32:03.892
know what a very,
very special day today is.

32:03.892 --> 32:09.230
I have chosen to make
Southern California my home.

32:09.230 --> 32:10.832
This town, the dreams
that are created,

32:10.832 --> 32:12.534
the films that
are created,

32:12.534 --> 32:14.603
undoubtedly have
more influence on me

32:14.603 --> 32:17.138
than any other single
factor in my life,

32:17.138 --> 32:20.075
and I just want you to know
that it means more to me

32:20.075 --> 32:21.477
than a Pulitzer Prize.

32:21.477 --> 32:23.679
Thank you very much.
I mean it.

32:26.348 --> 32:30.285
I was honored to be a real
part of Hollywood history,

32:30.285 --> 32:32.153
something I'd dreamt about

32:32.153 --> 32:35.056
since I was a kid
growing up in Chicago.

32:35.056 --> 32:39.661
But while I was receiving
accolades, I had no idea

32:39.661 --> 32:42.097
the trouble in Dorothy
Stratten's personal life

32:42.097 --> 32:43.799
was building...

32:43.799 --> 32:45.333
**

32:53.910 --> 32:57.380
...because while she
was working in New York,

32:57.380 --> 33:00.783
her husband Paul
was unraveling in L.A.

33:00.783 --> 33:04.020
* Today I'm just
a lonely man *

33:04.020 --> 33:07.156
* But tomorrow
I'll be okay *

33:07.156 --> 33:09.626
While the film
was filming in New York,

33:09.626 --> 33:12.194
Peter Bogdanovich
started having an affair

33:12.194 --> 33:14.096
with Dorothy on the set.

33:14.096 --> 33:17.567
* The whole wide world
will watch me *

33:17.567 --> 33:21.303
* As I walk up
to my throne *

33:21.303 --> 33:23.272
* Knights
in shining armor... *

33:23.272 --> 33:28.277
And that just kind of drove
Paul Snider a little mental.

33:28.277 --> 33:29.278
* Why *

33:29.278 --> 33:30.413
* Why *

33:30.413 --> 33:32.482
* Have I lost you? *

33:32.482 --> 33:34.517
* Have I lost you? *

33:34.517 --> 33:36.419
* Why? *

33:36.419 --> 33:37.487
* Why? *

33:37.487 --> 33:40.990
* Tell me why... *

33:40.990 --> 33:44.026
**

33:44.026 --> 33:47.196
Miss Stratten,
you have a phone call.

33:47.196 --> 33:48.865
Thanks.

33:51.033 --> 33:56.172
Hello? Hello?

33:56.172 --> 33:59.375
Don't...
Don't hang up.

33:59.375 --> 34:02.479
How did you
get this number?

34:02.479 --> 34:04.614
Why are you
doing this to me?

34:04.614 --> 34:08.518
You think I don't know
what unavailable means?

34:08.518 --> 34:13.422
Unavailable means
"fuck you, Paul."

34:13.422 --> 34:17.560
I know you're fucking him.

34:17.560 --> 34:23.666
Paul, stop.
Please stop.

34:23.666 --> 34:25.201
All I did was love you

34:25.201 --> 34:29.105
from the moment
I met you,

34:29.105 --> 34:32.742
but you don't
love me anymore.

34:32.742 --> 34:36.813
You don't love me
anymore, huh?

34:36.813 --> 34:41.317
I just want to be happy.

34:41.317 --> 34:44.086
Just let me be happy.

34:48.925 --> 34:53.362
Baby, see me
one more time?

34:53.362 --> 34:56.666
Please? Just once.

34:59.335 --> 35:04.974
Okay, well,
I've got to go now.

35:04.974 --> 35:07.577
I love you.

35:13.115 --> 35:15.985
**

35:19.689 --> 35:27.564
* You're gonna
make me cry *

35:27.564 --> 35:29.866
**

35:29.866 --> 35:31.768
* You're gonna make... *

35:31.768 --> 35:33.435
When the film wrapped,

35:33.435 --> 35:35.504
Dorothy returned to L.A.,

35:35.504 --> 35:38.708
ready to tell Paul
that she wanted a divorce.

35:38.708 --> 35:42.478
* Oh baby *

35:42.478 --> 35:44.847
* Don't make me cry *

35:58.995 --> 36:02.965
Didn't have to knock, baby.
This is your house.

36:02.965 --> 36:05.835
**

36:14.110 --> 36:17.446
It's over.

36:17.446 --> 36:20.249
My lawyer
will contact yours.

36:20.249 --> 36:23.119
**

36:26.756 --> 36:28.524
You'll be looked after.

36:28.524 --> 36:29.558
**

36:29.558 --> 36:31.560
I promise.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.396
**

36:34.396 --> 36:37.233
Endings are never easy.

36:37.233 --> 36:40.102
**

36:59.555 --> 37:03.760
* Want to hold her tight *

37:03.760 --> 37:07.964
* Lord make her
be all right *

37:07.964 --> 37:11.968
* I'm afraid
for the scrubby pine *

37:11.968 --> 37:15.938
* All the sweet
honeysuckle vine *

37:15.938 --> 37:19.108
* I'm afraid for my home *

37:19.108 --> 37:23.345
* For the fields
that I roamed *

37:23.345 --> 37:27.216
* Kick along down
a homeward road *

37:27.216 --> 37:31.120
* And your heart's
gotta take the load *

37:31.120 --> 37:34.891
* I'm afraid
to go home *

37:34.891 --> 37:38.094
* I'm afraid to go home *

37:47.603 --> 37:49.338
Read it and weep, Hef.

37:49.338 --> 37:50.439
Oh, really?

37:50.439 --> 37:51.774
Yeah.

37:59.481 --> 38:01.818
What's the matter?

38:01.818 --> 38:03.619
The police
are on the phone.

38:03.619 --> 38:05.321
The police?

38:05.321 --> 38:07.089
It's Dorothy.

38:13.830 --> 38:15.231
Hugh Hefner.

38:15.231 --> 38:17.199
Mr. Hefner,
this is Detective Simmons

38:17.199 --> 38:19.936
with the LAPD
Homicide Division.

38:23.039 --> 38:25.374
We are currently
conducting an investigation

38:25.374 --> 38:28.878
at 10881 Clarkson Road
in Rancho Park

38:28.878 --> 38:31.447
and have identified
the victim's body

38:31.447 --> 38:34.416
as a Miss Dorothy Stratten.

38:40.189 --> 38:42.925
I'm very sorry to have to
call you with this news,

38:42.925 --> 38:45.962
but it's my understanding
that you can assist us

38:45.962 --> 38:48.865
in notifying next of kin.

38:49.932 --> 38:52.134
Did Snider do this?

38:52.134 --> 38:54.871
I'd very much like to
leave my number with you

38:54.871 --> 38:57.173
so that, should I need
any more information...

38:57.173 --> 38:59.008
Paul Snider, her husband.

38:59.008 --> 39:00.542
Her ex-husband.
They're separated.

39:00.542 --> 39:01.543
Mr. Hefner...

39:01.543 --> 39:02.779
You have to find him.

39:02.779 --> 39:04.280
He might try
and leave the country.

39:04.280 --> 39:08.717
Mr. Hefner, Mr. Snider's
body is also at the scene.

39:12.421 --> 39:16.258
We're treating this
as a murder/suicide.

39:22.164 --> 39:25.567
On August 14th, 1980...

39:25.567 --> 39:28.237
**

39:28.237 --> 39:32.674
Paul Snider shot and
killed Dorothy Stratten...

39:32.674 --> 39:35.111
**

39:35.111 --> 39:38.680
and then turned the gun
on himself.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.583
She was only 20 years old.

39:41.583 --> 39:46.889
**

39:46.889 --> 39:51.527
The Dorothy Stratten
situation was... was awful.

39:51.527 --> 39:53.029
**

39:53.029 --> 39:55.697
She was the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen

39:55.697 --> 40:00.870
and sweet and...
I don't know, macho me,

40:00.870 --> 40:03.339
I'd try to protect her.

40:03.339 --> 40:07.576
**

40:07.576 --> 40:10.679
I didn't even know she
was married to that creep.

40:10.679 --> 40:15.284
As details of the horrific
crime were made public,

40:15.284 --> 40:18.254
my shock turned to horror.

40:18.254 --> 40:20.957
**

40:20.957 --> 40:22.591
I wondered
if there was something

40:22.591 --> 40:24.961
I could have done
to save her.

40:24.961 --> 40:26.428
**

40:26.428 --> 40:30.666
Hef was deeply affected
by Dorothy's death.

40:30.666 --> 40:32.835
**

40:32.835 --> 40:35.437
He felt very protective
of her

40:35.437 --> 40:39.741
and believed that
she was with a bad guy

40:39.741 --> 40:45.281
and hoped very much that
she could and would leave him.

40:45.281 --> 40:48.150
**

40:52.989 --> 40:55.691
Yeah. You...
You're from Vancouver.

40:55.691 --> 40:57.326
Uh-huh.

40:57.326 --> 40:58.928
Now, what did you do
in Vancouver?

40:58.928 --> 41:00.897
Were you a professional
model at all before...?

41:00.897 --> 41:02.932
No, I had just graduated
from high school

41:02.932 --> 41:05.467
when I was approached
by Playboy

41:05.467 --> 41:08.537
and I was working
in a telephone company.

41:08.537 --> 41:09.671
I was a clerk typist.

41:09.671 --> 41:11.140
You're putting me on.

41:11.140 --> 41:12.441
No. I worked there
just six weeks

41:12.441 --> 41:14.043
before they
carried me away.

41:14.043 --> 41:15.644
That was a good move.

41:16.913 --> 41:18.047
The only good thing
that ever came

41:18.047 --> 41:20.349
out of the
telephone company.

41:21.984 --> 41:24.520
In the span of five years,

41:24.520 --> 41:30.026
I lost both Bobbie...
now Dorothy.

41:30.026 --> 41:32.394
Death...
It's the one injustice

41:32.394 --> 41:33.595
that is universal.

41:33.595 --> 41:38.034
It's the great injustice
that you have to deal with.

41:38.034 --> 41:40.937
**

41:40.937 --> 41:46.742
But Dorothy...
It was so unjust.

41:46.742 --> 41:49.611
**

41:58.287 --> 42:02.124
* Every little movement *

42:02.124 --> 42:06.262
* Every motion of your hips *

42:06.262 --> 42:09.398
* I feel the compulsion *

42:09.398 --> 42:14.636
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

42:14.636 --> 42:18.941
* Is it a black magic spell *

42:18.941 --> 42:22.278
* You put me under? *

42:22.278 --> 42:25.948
* This miracle moment *

42:25.948 --> 42:30.152
* Never let it end *

42:30.152 --> 42:34.123
* Every little movement *

42:34.123 --> 42:38.160
* Is beyond improvement *

42:38.160 --> 42:40.762
* You are the magician *

42:40.762 --> 42:46.035
* I've been wishing for
forever *

42:46.035 --> 42:50.106
* Every
little movement *

42:50.106 --> 42:54.176
* Every little movement **
