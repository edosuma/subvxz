14:49.598 --> 14:52.184
Okay, no problem.
There's still time to save Wander.

14:52.267 --> 14:56.772
But first... I'm gonna need
an even biggerer blaster.

15:05.822 --> 15:10.494
Wander, it's go-time, buddy!
And by that I mean, we gotta go.

15:13.914 --> 15:18.669

you gotta pay attention.

self-destruct in 20, 19, 18...

Okay if I speed things up?

Me too.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.652
All three of us.

16:32.910 --> 16:35.662
(SCREAMS) Wander! What did ya...

16:35.746 --> 16:38.916
I just blew up that ship trying
to destroy that horrible thing.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.627
(GASPS) Horrible?
This cute, little booger?

16:42.211 --> 16:43.462
You're crazy.

16:43.545 --> 16:47.633
Look, I've been training' him.
Captain Tim, sit!

16:48.133 --> 16:50.385
Captain Tim, stand.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.138
-Speak.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.140
You have got to be kidding me.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.186
I... I can't believe it.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.854
I know, right?

17:01.146 --> 17:03.148
I've always wanted a pet,

17:03.232 --> 17:06.109
and this little guy's
stolen my heart, Sylvia.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.613
He has stolen my heart.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.742

-No, wait.
-Wander...

17:27.172 --> 17:31.385
I know, I know.
Captain Tim is a wild animal.

17:31.468 --> 17:35.264
And I can't change the fact that he wants
to devour my still-beating heart.

17:35.764 --> 17:39.142
But even so, I can't help
but love him, Sylvia.

17:39.268 --> 17:41.436
With all of my still-beating heart.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.441
Now, I came here to save
whoever was on this ship.

17:46.525 --> 17:50.904
And by golly, I will. No matter how many
eggs they wanna lay inside my rib cage.

17:51.238 --> 17:55.117
If I can't keep Captain Tim,
we have to find him a forever home.

17:55.617 --> 17:59.997

flesh-eating alien for a pet?

who's a bad boy? Who's a bad boy?

Sir, with all due respect,
I don't think this is the best idea!

18:42.456 --> 18:45.167
How dare you, Commander Peepers?

18:45.334 --> 18:48.253
Captain Tim here outranks you.
Don't you, boy?

You outrank him! He's your subordinate.
You outrank him, yes, you do! Yes, you do!
