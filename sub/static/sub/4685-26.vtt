Jessie do the speech?

Have you heard Jessie?

And he has been

04:17.677 --> 04:19.177
sneaking out at night.

- How can you - hear one tiny sneeze
- Over all this noise?

Why don't we just

09:33.407 --> 09:35.659
take them to a vet?

09:35.742 --> 09:37.390
Excellent notion.

you that maybe Zuri letting

12:52.063 --> 12:55.859
go of Millie the Mermaid

is really her way

Okay, my point is

13:08.413 --> 13:10.123
Zuri is growing up,

13:10.248 --> 13:11.709

And her breath.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.969
- Who are you? - Spies from Cafe
- Palais Poulet,

17:55.993 --> 17:57.245
Trying to sabotage

17:57.246 --> 17:58.495
my opening?

17:58.620 --> 18:00.580
Listen, we're really sorry.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.145
Just let us collect

18:02.146 --> 18:03.583
our last few lizard eggs

18:00.705 --> 18:03.583
and we'll be on our way.

18:03.708 --> 18:04.752
And I promise you,

18:04.753 --> 18:05.794
no more lizard births.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.840
(CUSTOMERS EXCLAIMING)

18:09.965 --> 18:11.071
Okay, no more lizard

18:11.072 --> 18:12.175
births starting now.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.471
(SCREAMING)

18:24.479 --> 18:25.876
Everyone has hatched

18:25.877 --> 18:27.273
except for Rikki and Tikki!

18:27.398 --> 18:28.399
Where could they be?

18:28.525 --> 18:30.777
(EXCLAIMING)

18:36.199 --> 18:37.763
My grand debut

18:37.764 --> 18:39.327
is ruined! Ruined!

18:41.872 --> 18:43.331
Listen, everybody! Look,

18:43.456 --> 18:45.251
I know it's a little gross

18:45.252 --> 18:47.044
that a bunch of lizards

18:47.210 --> 18:48.357
are running

18:48.358 --> 18:49.504
around the restaurant,

18:47.210 --> 18:49.504
drizzling amniotic fluid

18:49.629 --> 18:51.214
- all over your
- starter salads.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.427
But what looks to you

18:54.428 --> 18:55.844
like a bunch of

18:53.008 --> 18:55.844
disgusting lizards

18:55.969 --> 18:57.554
is really our family.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.519
- And to this little boy,
- they're everything.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.164
We've all just witnessed

19:03.165 --> 19:05.645
the wonder of new life!

19:05.770 --> 19:07.748
- So I know tonight - probably isn't what
- You thought it would be,

19:07.772 --> 19:09.107
But in a way,

19:09.108 --> 19:10.441
isn't it better?

19:10.567 --> 19:12.861
ALL: Nah!

19:13.904 --> 19:15.385
Hey, everyone!

19:15.386 --> 19:16.865
Free appetizers!

19:16.990 --> 19:18.491
(ALL CHEERING)

19:22.913 --> 19:24.372
(PLAYING)

19:26.249 --> 19:27.434
- Thank you
- for bathing, Luke.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.960
It really means a lot

19:28.961 --> 19:30.461
to Millie and me.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.548
You're welcome.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.758
I thought it would be

19:34.759 --> 19:35.842
disrespectful to smell

19:33.673 --> 19:35.842
worse than the deceased.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.598
- I'm so sorry
- for your loss.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.683
- I'd like to
- pay my respects.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.019
Um...

19:46.144 --> 19:47.938
- Where exactly do I
- pay my respects?

19:49.940 --> 19:51.254
Why don't you try the table

19:51.255 --> 19:52.567
with the body on it?

19:55.653 --> 19:56.821
Of course.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.243
You did a really great job.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.620
Millie never looked better.

20:03.745 --> 20:05.496
Thanks.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.062
- There was just
- one awkward moment

20:07.165 --> 20:08.208
When Zuri said

20:08.209 --> 20:09.250
I was applying lipstick

20:07.165 --> 20:09.250
to Millie's butt.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.919
So I told her it

20:10.920 --> 20:12.462
was the latest style.

20:12.587 --> 20:13.672
Remind me never to

20:13.673 --> 20:14.756
loan Zuri my lipstick.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.717
Zuri, you have

20:16.718 --> 20:18.384
my sympathy.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.782
But it is

20:19.783 --> 20:21.054
the circle of life.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.869
With every

20:22.870 --> 20:24.557
imaginary death

20:21.179 --> 20:24.557
comes a reptilian birth.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.829
- Try stitching
- that on a pillow.

20:28.853 --> 20:29.853
Oh, I did!

20:39.156 --> 20:41.617
Millie would be so

20:41.618 --> 20:44.077
touched that you all

20:39.156 --> 20:44.077
came to her mermorial.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.600
Especially you,

20:46.601 --> 20:47.705
Chubby the Bear.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.228
I know you're afraid

20:49.229 --> 20:50.625
to come to the park

20:47.831 --> 20:50.625
during hunting season.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.213
Millie was...

20:56.089 --> 20:57.715
She was...

20:57.841 --> 21:00.301
Oh, Millie!

21:01.136 --> 21:03.513
Come back!

21:05.682 --> 21:06.516
It'll be okay.

21:06.641 --> 21:07.914
Bertram,

21:07.915 --> 21:09.186
I knew you'd come!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.646
Praise be!

21:16.693 --> 21:18.382
Millie the Mermaid

21:18.383 --> 21:20.071
was many things to us,

21:20.197 --> 21:21.990
mermaid, friend,

21:22.740 --> 21:24.492
mer-friend.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.369
I think we can

21:26.370 --> 21:28.121
all agree that Millie was

21:29.164 --> 21:31.415
an excellent swimmer

21:31.541 --> 21:32.541
and a really fun gal.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.546
It's true.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.173
Whenever she came

21:38.174 --> 21:39.674
to my tea party,

21:36.671 --> 21:39.674
she made a splash.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.429
But most of all,

21:43.430 --> 21:45.722
Millie was family.

21:45.847 --> 21:48.517
Millie is survived by her

21:48.518 --> 21:51.186
three beautiful goldfish,

21:51.394 --> 21:52.499
Cheddar,

21:52.500 --> 21:53.604
Extreme Cheddar,

21:54.397 --> 21:55.773
and Cool Ranch.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.925
She is also survived

22:01.926 --> 22:03.447
by her best friend

22:00.403 --> 22:03.447
in the whole world,

22:03.573 --> 22:06.034
a little girl named

22:06.035 --> 22:08.494
Zuri Zenobia Ross,

22:10.788 --> 22:11.832
who I guess isn't

22:11.833 --> 22:12.874
a little girl anymore!

22:15.168 --> 22:17.962
(SOBBING)

22:18.088 --> 22:19.809
- Zuri might not be
- a little girl anymore,

22:19.881 --> 22:21.758
- But Bertram is sure
- blubbering like one.

22:24.094 --> 22:25.470
Bertram,

22:25.471 --> 22:26.846
that was beautiful!

22:26.971 --> 22:27.972
Thank you.

22:27.973 --> 22:28.973
You're welcome.

22:29.807 --> 22:30.807
It was an honor.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.105
I'm definitely

22:35.106 --> 22:36.773
asking you to speak

22:33.436 --> 22:36.773
at Chubby's bear-mitzvah.

22:43.113 --> 22:43.780
Then, Ravi the Magnificent

22:43.905 --> 22:46.449
defeated the evil chef

22:46.490 --> 22:47.555
and saved the

22:47.556 --> 22:48.618
magical baby lizards.

22:48.743 --> 22:49.743
The end.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.457
I think it worked.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.688
Well, almost being

22:55.689 --> 22:56.793
a main course would

22:54.582 --> 22:56.793
tucker anyone out.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.963
Sweet dreams, Ravi.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.632
Oh. Wait, Jessie.

23:02.757 --> 23:03.863
Here is the babies'

23:03.864 --> 23:04.968
feeding schedule.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.700
Please take

23:06.701 --> 23:08.305
the midnight, 3:00 a.m.,

23:05.093 --> 23:08.305
and 6:00 a.m. shifts.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.203
Hey, which shift

23:10.204 --> 23:11.474
are you taking?

23:11.599 --> 23:13.163
None. I am a grandpa.

23:13.164 --> 23:14.727
I need my sleep.
