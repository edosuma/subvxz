WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.571
Previously, on Limitless...
You've been working
for Senator Morra.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.307
I don't even know who
you are anymore.
I was forced into this.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.309
There's stuff
you don't know about.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.278
You better tell me.
I don't take that shot,

00:10.311 --> 00:13.214
I'm not immune
to the side effects of NZT.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.682
BRIAN: Huston, can you be
willing to testify

00:14.715 --> 00:15.683
to all this in court?

00:15.716 --> 00:17.051
Including that
it was Jarrod Sands

00:17.085 --> 00:18.052
that killed my father?

00:18.086 --> 00:19.820
That looks like a yes to me.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.556
Drop your weapon. Now!

00:23.557 --> 00:25.659
Rot in hell, Sands.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.927
My days here are numbered.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.697
I don't know exactly how long
the booster shot's gonna last.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.699
Naz isn't gonna risk
you taking a pill without it.

00:31.732 --> 00:35.536
You sacrificed your connection
to the immunity shot for me?

00:35.569 --> 00:38.472
You can't take NZT anymore.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.811
Okay, so, let's review.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.579
Jarrod Sands...

00:45.613 --> 00:47.415
and a group
of five or more other people

00:47.448 --> 00:50.451
are holding Piper Baird,
who, as most of you know,

00:50.484 --> 00:51.852
is kind of my girlfriend.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.123
Anyway, Sands is in jail,
and he's not talking,

00:55.156 --> 00:58.359
so we don't know
who the other members are.

00:58.392 --> 01:02.296
Thus, I have decided that
we will refer to them as...

01:02.330 --> 01:04.798
the Legion of... Whom.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.600
Question.
What? Yes.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.170
Shouldn't it be
the Legion of Who?

01:09.203 --> 01:10.471
It... really doesn't matter.

01:10.504 --> 01:11.505
No, actually,
Brian's right--

01:11.539 --> 01:13.407
"whom" is the object
of "Legion."
Think about it.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.176
War!
BRIAN: All right,

01:15.209 --> 01:16.477
guys, that's not the point.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.179
Finding out whom they are

01:18.212 --> 01:20.314
is the key to finding Piper,
all right?

01:20.348 --> 01:21.615
Uh, but that one should
have been "who," right?

01:21.649 --> 01:23.417
Yeah.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.785
The immunity enzyme.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.588
That's how I stayed alive on NZT
all that time. That...

01:27.621 --> 01:29.823
is what the legion wants
from her.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.192
But it's been a month.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.893
What if she's
already given it to them?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.296
Well, she wouldn't;
she's a fighter.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.332
What if... she fought...

01:38.366 --> 01:40.134
and lost?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.836
You know what?
No more questions.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.172
DENNIS:
Brian, didn't you say

01:44.205 --> 01:45.839
you were working
the afternoon shift today?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.309
BRIAN:
It's not easy to solve crimes
after the FBI fires you

01:48.342 --> 01:50.311
and takes your NZT away.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.313
My mom and dad took me back in,

01:52.346 --> 01:54.348
but they said
I had to pay rent, so...

01:54.382 --> 01:56.650
(sighs)
Well, that's a good question.

01:56.684 --> 02:00.154
Why buy the model
with the curved screen?
Yeah.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.790
Consumer Reports says it's
a complete waste of money.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.394
Well...

02:06.427 --> 02:08.196
I mean, uh...

02:08.229 --> 02:09.697
you're gonna...

02:09.730 --> 02:11.632
add value, maybe.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.900
Maybe not.

02:12.933 --> 02:13.934
B-But probably...

02:13.967 --> 02:16.770
vis-Г -vis the, uh...

02:16.804 --> 02:18.239
et cetera.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.873
You follow me?
Every now and then,

02:19.907 --> 02:22.176
I would have these
weird moments of clarity.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.911
But, Gary, is that journalist
from Consumer Reports

02:23.944 --> 02:25.946
gonna be there at your house
when your friends

02:25.979 --> 02:28.316
come over and see
just a regular TV on your wall?

02:28.349 --> 02:30.918
Will he say, "Huh. Gary is
usually a cutting-edge guy,

02:30.951 --> 02:33.887
"but in this case, he made
a cautious and sensible choice.

02:33.921 --> 02:37.225
"I guess we laud him
for being a cautious

02:37.258 --> 02:39.260
and sensible man"?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.965
Let's do this.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.667
Remind me again
which TV we're talking about.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.269
But they disappeared
as soon as they came.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.272
Just point it out on the wall.
I guess they were kind of,
like, flashbacks

02:51.305 --> 02:52.506
from taking so much NZT.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.708
Did I think about life
after the FBI?

02:54.742 --> 02:58.212
Sure. But mostly because my dad
kept asking me about my plan.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.980
Law school?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.516
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.785
I mean, think about it: I could
go to community college,

03:04.818 --> 03:05.919
I could get my grades up.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.556
You're a lawyer.
Cameron's a lawyer.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.258
Why not?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.594
Why not?

03:13.627 --> 03:14.795
(chuckles):
Yeah.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.564
Yeah, that's probably
the same reason

03:16.597 --> 03:19.600
Oliver Wendell Holmes
took the bar. "Why not?"

03:19.633 --> 03:22.336
I had no idea who
Oliver Wendell Whatever was,

03:22.370 --> 03:23.937
but my dad had a point--

03:23.971 --> 03:26.974
my heart wasn't really in
anything besides finding Piper.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.278
So, before
my last pill wore off,

03:30.311 --> 03:32.713
I wrote down everything
I could remember about Sands.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.949
So the answers and the names
of the other people who are

03:35.983 --> 03:39.687
in the Legion of Whom, they...
may be in there, somewhere.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.722
I mean, I'm just having
trouble getting at them.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.991
That's what everyone's
calling it at the CJC, you know.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.793
"The Legion of Whom."

03:45.826 --> 03:47.528
So you guys do miss me.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.964
Well, it looks no sadder
than what we've got.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.867
If Sands is part of a cabal of
like-minded criminals on NZT,

03:53.901 --> 03:55.736
we don't know what
ties him to them.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.539
And we don't know what
their motives are, so...

03:58.572 --> 04:00.274
It makes me nervous.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.376
Yeah. Me, too.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.512
That's why,
if we work together...

04:04.545 --> 04:06.914
Look, if you just bring me
another pill, Rebecca--

04:06.947 --> 04:09.317
I mean, my immunity shot
should still be working,

04:09.350 --> 04:11.452
and if I find Piper,
she can make more, just...
Brian...

04:11.485 --> 04:14.288
I can't give you an NZT pill--
the FBI doesn't know enough

04:14.322 --> 04:15.823
about that shot,
and if something

04:15.856 --> 04:18.459
happens to you...
I know. I'm a liability.
I know.

04:19.393 --> 04:22.630
Look, just...
take this, okay?

04:22.663 --> 04:25.933
There should be some valuable
information in there somewhere.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.635
I think.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.969
Sure.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.571
I have to get back.
All right.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.506
We will find
Piper, you know?

04:32.540 --> 04:34.074
The people that took her,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.009
they're on NZT, so that's
what we're looking for.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.745
There's only so much
NZT out there.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.547
She was right--
at least NZT

04:39.580 --> 04:41.549
hadn't been on the streets
for a while.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.850
But that was about to change.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.018
Just got
a whole supply of it in.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.555
From a new source, but
I tried it myself this morning,

04:47.588 --> 04:49.723
and it was like,
"Damn, Daniel!"

04:49.757 --> 04:51.559
How about a free sample?

04:53.060 --> 04:55.396
What's it called?
NZT.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.297
It's back...

04:59.132 --> 05:03.637
*

05:07.375 --> 05:10.378
*

05:31.399 --> 05:34.001
(dramatic news theme playing)

05:34.034 --> 05:36.670
Breaking news tonight,
as a string of recent crimes

05:36.704 --> 05:40.708
have been linked to a new
synthetic drug called NZT.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.477
Authorities warn
it's as addictive as krokodil

05:43.511 --> 05:45.879
or bath salts,
and just as dangerous.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.148
Reportedly,
it makes the user believe

05:48.181 --> 05:50.484
they're capable of anything.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.720
NYPD's been chasing reports
of erratic behavior

05:52.753 --> 05:54.588
all across the five boroughs.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.824
People are killing each other
over this drug.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.958
ANCHORWOMAN:
Authorities are in the process

05:57.991 --> 05:59.960
of running down
the drug's source.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.495
(distorted voice):
Mexican cartel.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.030
Weed's drying up
as it gets legalized,

06:03.063 --> 06:05.132
and they see this
as a start-up venture,

06:05.165 --> 06:07.468
their biggest,
most lucrative market yet.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.904
The NYPD have linked another
crime to this growing trend.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.107
The double homicide
of Curtis and Rosie Tanaka,

06:14.141 --> 06:15.976
a husband-and-wife
pharmacology team

06:16.009 --> 06:18.846
found murdered in their
East Village lab last night.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.749
We're still investigating
whether it was premeditated,

06:21.782 --> 06:24.518
but it seems the perp
broke into the Tanakas' lab

06:24.552 --> 06:26.820
searching for NZT.
The Tanakas were making it?

06:26.854 --> 06:29.022
No, no, no, no, no.
We have no proof of that yet.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.759
But if they were, if they were
at the source of the epidemic,

06:31.792 --> 06:33.861
our job is half done--
if they weren't...

06:33.894 --> 06:36.129
then we have to search
for who is making it

06:36.163 --> 06:37.765
and shut them down.
And shut them down.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.667
SAC Pouran.
It's been a minute.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.201
Rebecca Harris,

06:41.234 --> 06:42.936
Agent Adam Brewster, DEA.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.105
He's our liaison for
this investigation.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.640
Naz and I worked pretty close

06:46.674 --> 06:48.742
the last time this stuff
was on the streets.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.043
This time it's worse.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.145
So you guys got blindsided, too.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.114
Well, at least it's
confined to New York City.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.649
For now.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.719
I want us all on the same page,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.788
make sure we all have
the relevant information

07:00.821 --> 07:03.591
for our own NZT investigation.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.827
The FBI is conducting a probe
into Senator Edward Morra

07:06.860 --> 07:09.497
and his former head of security,
Jarrod Sands.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.831
We think they
may be involved

07:10.864 --> 07:13.967
in the use and distribution
of NZT.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.770
Edward Morra?
You're serious?

07:16.804 --> 07:19.507
We have a fair amount
of evidence to support it,

07:19.540 --> 07:22.142
but... for now,
we're just building a case.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.578
We think Sands has been
gathering individuals

07:24.612 --> 07:27.781
and supplying them with NZT
to form some kind of...

07:27.815 --> 07:29.883
smart-drug-enhanced collective.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.952
We have him in custody,
but for now he's not talking.

07:31.985 --> 07:32.953
Hold on.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.122
You're telling me
there's a sitting senator

07:35.155 --> 07:38.592
on a Schedule I drug...
and his deputy has split off

07:38.626 --> 07:40.694
to create some kind
of Brainiac cult.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.095
If you come across anything

07:42.129 --> 07:43.897
that points
to Morra, Sands

07:43.931 --> 07:45.533
or this group that
they're forming,

07:45.566 --> 07:46.967
we would certainly
like to know.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.802
How did you learn this?

07:48.836 --> 07:51.505
We had a consultant--
Brian Finch.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.642
He was our expert on NZT.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.043
When you say "was"...

07:56.977 --> 07:58.846
Finch was pulled from the FBI.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.213
There were complications.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.851
So we have people in custody

08:03.884 --> 08:05.986
that we believe are still
under the influence of NZT,

08:06.019 --> 08:08.121
so I suggest we start
a conversation

08:08.155 --> 08:10.223
before they start to come
down off it, yeah?

08:10.257 --> 08:12.793
Bring on the fugazi geniuses.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.029
This may come as
a surprise to you...

08:16.063 --> 08:18.899
(whispering): but I've done
some drugs in my day.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.201
This stuff?

08:21.234 --> 08:22.870
This is peerless.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.974
Well... I'm not on it.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.743
I make it a point
to never sample the product.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.713
I just give it
to my grad students.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.715
Have you ever considered
the possibility

08:34.748 --> 08:36.083
that it came from
a newly sentient,

08:36.116 --> 08:38.552
hostile artificial intelligence?

08:38.586 --> 08:40.621
When this drug goes wide,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.656
nothing will ever be the same.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.793
You get enough people rocking
Apocryphon at the same time,

08:45.826 --> 08:48.261
that's when
the real revolution will start.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.262
REBECCA:
Stop right there.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.598
What did you just say?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.299
What? Apocryphon?

08:52.332 --> 08:53.300
What is that?

08:53.333 --> 08:55.135
From what I've discerned,

08:55.168 --> 08:57.037
it's one of the street names
of the drug.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.909
(low, indistinct conversations)

09:06.346 --> 09:07.314
Agent Harris?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.916
Wh... Yes?

09:09.917 --> 09:10.984
Oh, I'm not much of
a tea drinker,

09:11.018 --> 09:12.620
but thank you.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.787
Uh, the tea's for me.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.288
I pegged you as coffee, black.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.757
Nothin' fancy.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.991
Thanks.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.894
So I talked to my guy
in forensics.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.730
Can't find a connection
between NZT

09:22.763 --> 09:24.297
and the husband-and-wife
chemists.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.133
So it's a dead end?
Thought so,

09:26.166 --> 09:28.101
but a buddy at the 23rd precinct

09:28.135 --> 09:29.937
told me about another murder

09:29.970 --> 09:31.939
that happened today.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.373
Victim's a male pharmacologist,

09:33.406 --> 09:35.375
working in some kind
of start-up lab.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.311
Based on that,
I did some digging,

09:38.345 --> 09:41.882
and two other pharma types
were killed last week.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.784
Cops chalked the deaths up
as randos, but...

09:43.817 --> 09:45.619
It's a pattern.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.956
Definitely more than just
junkies jonesing for NZT.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.391
Maybe it's somebody who's
looking for the original source.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.727
Or trying to take out
the competition.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.128
That's what
I was thinking.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.198
I'm, uh, taking a team
to figure it out.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.399
You want to come?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.703
No, I should finish going
through these interrogations.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.704
Speaking of which,

10:03.737 --> 10:06.940
did any of your sources
mention "Apocryphon"?

10:06.974 --> 10:09.142
What do you think it means?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.944
I don't know yet.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.246
FEMALE REPORTER:
Astonished onlookers
at the Bronx Zoo

10:13.280 --> 10:15.949
watched as a man,
reportedly high on NZT,

10:15.983 --> 10:18.118
jumped into the lion habitat

10:18.151 --> 10:19.920
and proceeded to tame
one of the animals,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.421
to the point where she was

10:21.454 --> 10:23.056
literally eating
out of his hand.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.058
Oh, man.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.027
We gotta get
some of that.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.097
I was watching these
videos and snaps of people

10:30.130 --> 10:32.165
doing all this
completely dope stuff on NTZ...

10:32.199 --> 10:34.067
NZT.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.070
Heart it makes you just wicked
smart, like Einstein or, uh...

10:37.104 --> 10:39.740
What's the differently
abled dude's name?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.742
The one with the
robot voice. Uh...

10:41.775 --> 10:43.376
Stephen Hawking?
Nope.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.113
I don't know. I'd probably know
if I was on it.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.314
It's like a...

10:47.347 --> 10:50.117
a Viagra for your brain.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.919
It's a brain boner.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.186
Yeah.
I don't know, man.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.924
It sounds pretty dangerous.
No, man. Come on.
Two words:

10:56.957 --> 10:58.225
Media scare tactics.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.027
That's three words.
You want to know why?

11:00.060 --> 11:02.295
'Cause the drug doesn't
come from America.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.097
And if America can't profit
on it,

11:04.131 --> 11:05.265
then they make it illegal.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.134
That, my man, is
how the world works.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.001
Is it?
Yeah.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.036
Mm.

11:09.069 --> 11:13.006
But, uh... (inhales)
I could probably get some.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.008
I'm pretty connected.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.344
And what would you do
if you had some, Grover?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.046
Ooh.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.481
Two chicks at the same time.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.183
You're quoting Office Space.
Yes!

11:23.216 --> 11:25.185
Yes, man.
And that's why we're buds.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.187
Is it? Yeah.
'Cause you just...
you get me, man.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.190
Anyway... (sighs) I don't
know what I'd do with it,

11:30.223 --> 11:33.894
but, uh, imagine
the possibilities.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.864
ANCHORMAN: The epidemic shows
no signs of slowing.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.166
Emergency rooms from across
the five boroughs are reporting

11:39.199 --> 11:41.501
an influx of patients
with the same

11:41.534 --> 11:43.436
worrisome neurological symptoms:

11:43.470 --> 11:46.807
disorientation, memory loss,
and blurred vision.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.309
The CDC warns NZT abuse
is becoming
I'm glad that's not you.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.444
a major...
Yeah.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.446
Me, too.
No, I'm serious,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.115
Brian.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.284
You dodged a bullet.
You got lucky.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.486
I feel very lucky.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.889
I wear a name tag to work,

12:01.922 --> 12:04.157
and it has my name on it.
Okay.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.127
It's been hard. I know you're
worried about your friend.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.797
Mm. Piper was more
than a friend, Dad.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.398
Yes, I know she's more
than a friend.

12:11.431 --> 12:15.302
And you know that I'm reaching
out to anyone who can help.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.269
There's a guy who works
with the firm.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.906
He's an investigator.
As good as it gets.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.908
He's looking for her.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.175
Thanks.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.212
Okay.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.017
(phone buzzes, whistles)

12:32.019 --> 12:34.021
REBECCA'S VOICE:

12:37.224 --> 12:38.225
Hey.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.362
Top secret meet-up?

12:42.395 --> 12:43.897
I like it.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.333
You're here to call
me in, aren't you?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.535
All that stuff on the news,
it's crazy.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.538
I mean, you guys must be...
What can you tell me
about this?

12:51.571 --> 12:53.907
Uh... (exhales)

12:53.941 --> 12:56.977
I can tell you definitively
that it is a series of numbers

12:57.010 --> 12:59.980
and letters
that I wrote down one time.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.449
It's also the fourth album
for the Sword.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.418
No, I don't know what
it means right now.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.287
But I did write it down
while I was on NZT,

13:07.320 --> 13:09.122
so as soon as you
give me my pill...

13:09.156 --> 13:11.291
(scoffs)

13:12.893 --> 13:14.127
Okay.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.863
You don't have a pill
for me, do you?

13:15.896 --> 13:16.997
That's not why you're here.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.999
Brian, what goes on out there

13:19.032 --> 13:21.334
doesn't affect your situation
with the FBI.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.038
I'm sorry.

13:27.875 --> 13:32.179
You wrote this word down weeks
before NZT dropped in Manhattan.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.480
How did you know
the street name of a drug

13:33.513 --> 13:35.348
that wasn't on the street?

13:38.018 --> 13:38.852
What, were you hoping that

13:38.886 --> 13:40.487
I'd just happen
to remember something?

13:41.621 --> 13:43.456
So, basically,
you came here to remind me

13:43.490 --> 13:46.326
that with NZT I'm helpful,
but without it,

13:46.359 --> 13:48.361
I'm not.
You know what?

13:48.395 --> 13:51.364
God, I feel like that guy
from that book

13:51.398 --> 13:54.868
who gets really smart
and then gets really dumb again.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.937
You mean Flowers for Algernon?

13:56.970 --> 13:59.239
I don't remember what it
was called. That's the point.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.373
Brian, n...
Question:

14:00.407 --> 14:02.442
are you guys even looking
for Piper?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.078
Of course we are.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.615
(phone chimes)
But, technically,

14:08.648 --> 14:10.951
most of our resources
are on this right now,

14:10.984 --> 14:13.053
so...

14:13.086 --> 14:15.422
I have to go.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.857
Keep this, in case
it triggers something.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.099
(blipping)

14:26.133 --> 14:28.268
Boop.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.937
(humming)

14:29.970 --> 14:31.471
BRIAN: Grover.
Gah!

14:32.505 --> 14:34.241
You said you have
a hookup, right?

14:34.274 --> 14:35.275
You can find NZT?

14:36.276 --> 14:37.677
I might've made a call, yeah.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.947
There might be a party tonight.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.348
Do they have some?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.316
Thought you weren't cool.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.186
You're not a narc, are you?

14:46.219 --> 14:49.322
Yes, Grover, and I work
for the FBI, in an office

14:49.356 --> 14:51.558
called Headquarters!
with an exclamation point.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.227
All right, all right, I just
meant you were freaked out about

14:54.261 --> 14:57.097
the side effects. And I don't
want to ruin anyone's trip

14:57.130 --> 14:59.566
by bringing along
Debbie Downer.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.234
So you on the bus?
'Cause this train

15:01.268 --> 15:03.103
is leaving the station, buddy.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.371
Yes. I'm on the bus.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.572
And the train.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.474
I'm gonna...
(scanner blips)

15:07.507 --> 15:09.943
Look, I want to buy drugs...
(quietly): with you.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.684
*

15:17.717 --> 15:18.351
Wow.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.223
BRIAN:
An entire hallway

15:23.256 --> 15:24.557
made with drinking straws...?

15:25.558 --> 15:27.594
I think
we're in the right place.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.098
Hey.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.567
So, uh, just hang back
and follow my lead.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.469
*

15:36.503 --> 15:38.038
MAN:
Come on, now.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.374
(laughing, cheering)

15:41.408 --> 15:42.609
Hey, I'm gonna go
look for Alice.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.610
All right, yeah.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.078
* ...be a hero?

15:45.112 --> 15:47.414
* Standing fast and easy

15:47.447 --> 15:49.549
* With an appropriate grin

15:49.582 --> 15:51.084
* Brother, not that way

15:51.118 --> 15:52.119
* They'll take you away

15:52.152 --> 15:54.554
* Give me your gun

15:54.587 --> 15:56.123
* It's no use to anyone

15:56.156 --> 15:58.525
* Instead

15:58.558 --> 16:00.060
* I freeze

16:00.093 --> 16:02.595
* Seeing if I shut up

16:02.629 --> 16:04.131
* And stay real still

16:04.164 --> 16:05.598
* Maybe he won't kill

16:05.632 --> 16:07.100
* At least not me...

16:07.134 --> 16:08.068
GROVER: Hey.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.402
Yeah.
Think I found her.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.503
* ...to be a hero?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.172
That's when Taylor
Swift was sworn in

16:12.205 --> 16:14.174
to the 13 bloodlines
of the Illuminati

16:14.207 --> 16:16.376
by the queen
herself, BeyoncГ©.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.211
(oohing, aahing)

16:18.245 --> 16:19.212
Uh, hey.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.547
Alice.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.514
Grover.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.684
Uh, my cousin
Sheila's friend.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.521
Uh, any-anyway, my-my friend
and I were just wondering, uh,

16:28.555 --> 16:30.690
if you have any of that...
if you have any of that stuff

16:30.723 --> 16:32.559
that's going around,
you know, the...
Apocryphon.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.528
It's small, it's round,
it's impossibly clear.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.696
40 bucks a pop.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.698
All right,
we'll take two.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.533
Hangover's rough.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.035
And the trip can be intense.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.703
Usually you use about
ten percent of your brain...

16:43.736 --> 16:46.273
Yeah, that's a myth, actually,
that whole ten percent thing.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.641
But who's to say, really?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.677
So do we got to take
this with food or...?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.345
Whatever flies your kite.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.114
All right, thank you.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.117
So, uh, what do we do now?

16:57.150 --> 16:59.586
Do we just, like...
go ahead and take it?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.288
Were you serious
about the food thing?

17:01.321 --> 17:02.289
Because I haven't
eaten in a while.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.290
I'm a little hungry.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.757
Okay, I'll just
have one too.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.294
Don't see why not,
right? (chuckles)

17:07.327 --> 17:09.462
(grunts)
Ooh.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.397
Okay.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.632
Wonder how long it takes
to, like, kick in.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.567
Do you think it's as
intense as she said it is?

17:14.601 --> 17:16.436
Should we stay here,
or should we go, like,

17:16.469 --> 17:18.438
out into, uh, nature...

17:18.471 --> 17:20.440
BRIAN: As Grover rambled
like a nervous kid

17:20.473 --> 17:22.542
on the climb
up a roller coaster,

17:22.575 --> 17:23.576
I had my own concerns.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.678
If I'm not protected
by the immunity shot,

17:25.712 --> 17:28.548
I couldn't predict if I'd just
get a hangover or worse.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.750
Like the heroin junkie
who goes back for one more hit,

17:30.783 --> 17:33.520
that one hit that kills him.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.556
But as it kicked in,
my fears fell away...

17:36.589 --> 17:38.625
replaced by visions of Piper.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.460
I had to focus.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.130
Dude, welcome back!

17:43.163 --> 17:46.666
You know, if you died on NZT,
this would be my heaven.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.536
Except for the part where all
these people lose their teeth

17:49.569 --> 17:51.238
and get dementia.

17:51.271 --> 17:55.275
Right. Which is exactly
why we need to solve this.

17:57.544 --> 17:58.745
(shuddering breath):
Okay.

17:58.778 --> 17:59.879
Apocryphon.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.614
Where did I see this?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.283
Jarrod Sands doesn't
work for me anymore.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.784
He's working with other people.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.753
BRIAN:
Other people?

18:06.786 --> 18:08.888
What if Apocryphon is a person?
What does it mean?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.891
What if it was named
after whoever made it?

18:11.924 --> 18:14.261
Somebody who used to be
in Morra's camp?

18:14.294 --> 18:15.728
And then branched off
with Sands,

18:15.762 --> 18:18.265
but this time, he made
a new version of NZT,

18:18.298 --> 18:19.632
and named it after himself.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.301
Which means
tracking down Apocryphon

18:21.334 --> 18:22.902
might lead us to Piper.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.738
So all we need to do...
Is trace these pills back
to wherever they came from.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.740
Uh, what about Grover?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.409
He's our good buddy.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.877
And, look, if you're
tracking down NZT,

18:30.910 --> 18:32.745
two people can move
faster than one.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.781
Right.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.784
ALICE: I'm not sure Taylor
will lead us to enlightenment,

18:37.817 --> 18:41.321
but I can say for certain she
will take us one step closer.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.822
Wow. Yeah.
At least.

18:42.855 --> 18:43.656
Grover!
GROVER: Yeah!

18:43.690 --> 18:45.658
Hey, man, Taylor Swift

18:45.692 --> 18:47.227
is seriously gonna
take over the world.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.561
Well, shake it off.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.562
I'm getting you
out of here.
Okay.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.630
Hey, Alice.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.300
Do you mind telling me
where you got this stuff?

18:54.334 --> 18:55.235
Let me rephrase that.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.569
I know someone who knows things.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.770
Her name is Andrea.

18:57.804 --> 18:58.471
And I'm pretty sure
I heard her mention

18:58.505 --> 18:59.572
that she knows
someone who has

18:59.606 --> 19:03.543
Taylor's unreleased single,
"Dark Blue Tennessee."

19:03.576 --> 19:06.646
Blue is the primary color
of Freemasonry.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.281
I know.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.450
Tell him I sent you.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.851
You got it.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.920
Bye.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.423
BRIAN: I told Grover I wanted
to know where NZT came from

19:16.456 --> 19:18.425
for the simple reason
that I was curious.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.728
And he, well, he was just
enjoying the ride.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.865
After some bartering,

19:25.898 --> 19:28.601
Alice's friend gave me
the number of his contact,

19:28.635 --> 19:30.837
a girl named Polly, who sent us
to her hook-up,

19:30.870 --> 19:33.306
Ana, who sent us to her dealer,

19:33.340 --> 19:35.242
Drexel.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.444
Problem was the higher
up the chain we got,

19:37.477 --> 19:38.778
people weren't so eager
to share their contacts.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.780
But money always talks.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.816
Which is exactly how
we ended up here.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.852
This guy's name is Hades.

19:45.885 --> 19:46.886
Draw your own conclusions.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.322
But thanks, in part,
to my job at Datavision,

19:49.356 --> 19:52.325
I knew how to work
even the toughest customers.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.226
Have you ever considered

19:53.260 --> 19:54.727
the reason you're seeing
a decline in sales

19:54.761 --> 19:56.496
could be because of your name?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.632
I mean, I get why you chose it.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.668
It's powerful, and I love it.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.336
But then it appeals
to people like me,

20:03.370 --> 20:04.871
with death metal
tendencies.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.739
But imagine you're
an 18-year-old kid.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.308
You're making your first buy.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.642
You're nervous.

20:09.676 --> 20:10.777
I mean, take my friend
Grover here, for example.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.312
He's on the wrong
side of 30,

20:12.345 --> 20:13.780
and he is literally shaking
in his boots right now.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.648
Isn't that right, Grover?
I'm 29.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.816
The point is...

20:16.849 --> 20:18.485
that 18-year-old scared kid,

20:18.518 --> 20:20.287
is he gonna choose
the guy named Hades?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.654
Probably not.

20:23.356 --> 20:26.493
Maybe... it's time
for a new moniker.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.466
My mom used to call me Pumpkin.

20:33.866 --> 20:34.867
Huh.

20:35.868 --> 20:36.836
At the end of the night,

20:36.869 --> 20:38.938
we had a stockpile of NZT

20:38.971 --> 20:40.307
as well as the names
of the major drug dealers

20:40.340 --> 20:41.941
selling in Manhattan.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.346
Now all we had to do
was put them in order,

20:46.379 --> 20:49.616
so I'd remember what it all
meant once the NZT wore off.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.955
Which is how I ended up
with this... thing.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.024
Not my best work,
but I did put it together

20:58.057 --> 20:59.926
as I was coming down, so...

21:06.433 --> 21:07.434
What is that thing?

21:08.835 --> 21:11.471
It's the model.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.973
For the distribution path
of Apocryphon,

21:14.006 --> 21:15.708
as far as we were able
to trace last night.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.743
You don't remember?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.811
(groans quietly)

21:18.845 --> 21:21.414
Alice wasn't kidding.
I feel like crap.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.984
I'm gonna go puke now.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.353
Yeah.
Feel better, man.

21:29.556 --> 21:30.923
(lock buzzing)
REBECCA: Four weeks in here,

21:30.957 --> 21:32.425
you've had nothing to say.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.993
Why did you ask me to come here?

21:34.026 --> 21:37.364
I asked you to come because
this unfortunate NZT plague

21:37.397 --> 21:39.632
has had unforeseen
consequences for me.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.701
As in, Senator Morra has friends

21:41.734 --> 21:44.837
in all sorts of places,
including this one.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.839
Those friends,
in the wake of

21:46.873 --> 21:49.576
that drug's release...
(sighs)

21:51.010 --> 21:53.513
They're making moves even now
to eliminate me.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.947
You want a transfer.

21:55.815 --> 21:56.783
Yeah.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.884
What do you have to offer?

21:57.917 --> 22:01.421
Well, I'm no biochemist.

22:01.454 --> 22:04.524
But I do know the chemical
compound that makes NZT NZT.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.627
No one is producing legitimate
drugs with that compound

22:07.660 --> 22:10.797
in the numbers required
to fuel this outbreak.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.032
So, if you find
that chemical

22:13.065 --> 22:16.736
and you find who's buying it
in mass amounts--

22:16.769 --> 22:18.871
even a half-decent investigator
should be able

22:18.905 --> 22:20.940
to find their way
to the lab producing it.

22:20.973 --> 22:21.941
What's the chemical?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.476
I don't know.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.144
I wouldn't even recognize it
if you told me.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.647
But there are only so many

22:27.680 --> 22:29.949
neuroenhancing compounds
in the world,

22:29.982 --> 22:31.951
much less New York.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.123
Now, about my transfer...

22:37.156 --> 22:39.125
I'll run this down.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.360
We'll see.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.164
(lock buzzes)

22:45.197 --> 22:46.899
(latch clicks)

22:46.933 --> 22:49.469
Well, the good news is that
thanks to Agent Harris's

22:49.502 --> 22:52.672
chat with Sands, we've been able
to narrow the pool of chemists

22:52.705 --> 22:54.741
who could be
manufacturing NZT.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.976
We've got ten pharmacologists

22:57.009 --> 22:59.812
who have expertise
in cutting-edge nootropic drugs,

22:59.846 --> 23:03.115
who are registered with the DEA
to have access

23:03.149 --> 23:04.984
to Schedule II chemicals.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.987
We're looking for two things
here: the person who created NZT

23:08.020 --> 23:10.156
and whoever
is after that person.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.591
So if we align our mindset

23:11.624 --> 23:13.159
with the latter,
I think we have a better chance

23:13.192 --> 23:14.961
at catching both. Um,

23:14.994 --> 23:17.029
I've been in contact
with the dispensary and they're

23:17.063 --> 23:19.065
sending over a list of chemicals
that are used in NZT.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.067
We can cross-check
that list with suppliers;

23:21.100 --> 23:24.704
see if any of these chemists
have placed an order recently.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.905
Exactly.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.173
And if we work quickly,

23:27.206 --> 23:29.776
we might actually
save some lives here.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.616
I'll be right back.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.151
BRIAN:
I used to work here.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.554
Your name's Janice, right?
Or is it Diane?

23:41.588 --> 23:44.023
I-I don't really remember names
right now, but I remember you

23:44.056 --> 23:46.192
have a cat;
the cat's name is Janice.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.828
Diane?
Brian.

23:48.861 --> 23:49.929
Hey.

23:49.962 --> 23:50.930
What are you doing here?

23:50.963 --> 23:51.998
I got to show you something.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.500
I just need, like, five minutes.

23:54.667 --> 23:55.902
Thank you, Denise,
he's with me.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.937
Ah! Denise!

24:00.206 --> 24:03.142
So I tracked the NZT supply
to this guy Apocryphon...

24:03.175 --> 24:05.512
Wait, it's a guy?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.680
Yeah.
I thought it was
a street name for the drug.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.148
Brian, this...

24:09.181 --> 24:10.016
What?

24:10.049 --> 24:13.520
Why is this so crafty
yet functional?

24:14.721 --> 24:16.823
You did not take NZT.

24:16.856 --> 24:17.790
Well, it's out there, Rebecca.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.792
And I may or may not
have gone to a party,

24:19.826 --> 24:21.994
and I may or may not of--
How do you feel?

24:22.028 --> 24:23.262
Great.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.031
Thank you for asking.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.999
I told you my immunity shot
was still working.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.001
But look, I didn't
come here to gloat.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.269
I didn't come here
just to gloat.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.971
The point is

24:32.004 --> 24:34.006
Grover and I, we went around
the entire city last night--

24:34.040 --> 24:34.674
"Grover"?

24:34.707 --> 24:36.208
Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

24:36.242 --> 24:39.011
Okay, continue.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.147
So, based on the dealers
I bought the NZT from,

24:41.180 --> 24:43.716
I triangulated the possible
origin point to the Bronx

24:43.750 --> 24:45.585
and this compounding pharmacy.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.153
And I'm willing to bet you

24:47.186 --> 24:49.756
anything that the pharmacist
who works there,

24:49.789 --> 24:51.924
Clay Meeks,

24:51.958 --> 24:54.694
is Apocryphon.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.228
Whew.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.030
Okay.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.266
I'll check that name
against the list we have,

25:00.299 --> 25:02.969
but...

25:03.002 --> 25:05.104
You shouldn't be taking
unregulated NZT, Brian.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.106
I mean, I know
you feel fine today,

25:07.139 --> 25:09.008
but it could be laced
with anything.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.577
Yeah, but-but
if this is our guy,

25:10.610 --> 25:12.078
and if he can lead us to Piper,

25:12.111 --> 25:14.113
then there's no risk at all--
I can have the enzyme.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.048
There's no Clay Meeks
on our list.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.249
All right, well, maybe
your list is incomplete.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.718
Or maybe our guys
are working together.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.086
I don't know, but look,
if you took this

25:20.119 --> 25:21.921
upstairs...
Then what?

25:21.954 --> 25:24.624
So you're taking NZT that could
be laced with God knows what,

25:24.657 --> 25:26.926
and you're working
with some guy named Grover.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.596
Grover's a Muppet's name, Brian.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.097
How am I supposed
to present this to Naz?

25:31.130 --> 25:32.832
Or to the DEA?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.634
And if you are buying
or selling NZT,

25:34.667 --> 25:37.269
then they'll arrest you.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.072
I'm in an impossible situation.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.141
Don't take it to them.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.275
Come with me.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.979
There you are.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.648
Well, I hope I'm
not interrupting.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.883
Agent Brewster,
this is Brian Finch.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.251
Hi.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.220
Oh, yes, I've heard of you.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.055
Is that so?

25:56.088 --> 25:57.356
Your name's Agent Brewster?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.025
I think I heard of your sister.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.060
Punky, yeah.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.963
Well, we were just
wrapping things up.

26:03.996 --> 26:06.599
Okay, well, we got that list
of dispensaries upstairs.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.735
Are you part
of this investigation?

26:11.370 --> 26:13.239
No, I'm not.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.874
You guys have at it.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.614
The FBI didn't need me.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.616
I didn't need them.

26:23.650 --> 26:27.153
At this point,
I didn't need NZT, either.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.656
All I needed to do was finish
what I started.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.158
Which meant finding Clay Meeks.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.193
(lock buzzes)

26:39.231 --> 26:41.200
Help you?

26:41.233 --> 26:43.369
Hi, yeah, you guys
do compounding here?

26:43.402 --> 26:45.004
That depends.
What do you need?

26:45.037 --> 26:49.241
Well, actually, I was kind of
wondering about Apocryphon.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.210
Never heard of it.

26:51.243 --> 26:54.013
See, I don't think it's an it.
I think it's a he.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.148
Unless I'm crazy wrong,
I think he's you--

26:56.182 --> 26:57.784
Clay Meeks.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.652
You rocking it right now,
brother?

26:59.686 --> 27:01.788
No, not right now.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.022
It's kind of a long story.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.257
Maybe you tell me yours,
I'll tell you mine?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.226
Like how we both know Sands,

27:07.259 --> 27:08.795
except you're in league
with him-- NZT flood,

27:08.828 --> 27:10.229
panic in the streets?

27:13.365 --> 27:15.367
Let's talk in the back.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.706
So you want to talk about NZT?

27:19.739 --> 27:21.307
You and everybody else.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.209
Let me guess.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.443
You figured out
that I'm the one

27:24.476 --> 27:26.278
that's responsible
for the flood.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.681
That I'm the only one
who can mass produce

27:28.715 --> 27:29.916
the unproducible,

27:29.949 --> 27:32.184
change the way the world works.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.353
You on NZT right now?

27:34.386 --> 27:36.088
Nah, never touch the stuff.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.189
Right.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.091
You work with Sands?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.260
If you ask Sands,
I work for him.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.697
Him and his
Hellfire Genius Club.

27:44.731 --> 27:48.167
(scoffs) I've been calling it
the Legion of Whom.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.837
Not bad.

27:50.870 --> 27:54.040
Anyways, I got my own plans.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.075
Pandora's Box
has been opened.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.310
Ain't no sealing
it back up now.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.980
You're planning
on releasing more?

28:01.013 --> 28:02.815
Man, why are you
telling me all this?

28:02.849 --> 28:04.884
I'm not trying to hide it.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.418
I think it's a good thing.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.987
You know, give the people

28:08.020 --> 28:10.456
a... a dose of truth.

28:12.058 --> 28:15.261
You know what "Apocryphon"
means, don't you?

28:16.763 --> 28:19.065
It's the knowledge
that can't be taught.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.332
Hmm.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.768
We're talking
about revelation here;

28:21.801 --> 28:23.903
a literal game changer.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.304
Well, I'm looking
for Piper Baird.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.007
You got any of that knowledge?

28:30.409 --> 28:33.880
Uh... Sands is really precious
about the whole thing.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.082
Yeah, but you know who she is,
don't you?

28:36.115 --> 28:37.416
Hey, you gotta know something.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.485
We all gotta find
our own truth.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.887
What does that mean?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.354
Where are you going?

28:42.388 --> 28:44.223
I'm not going anywhere.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.257
I was never here.

28:59.538 --> 29:00.672
MAN (over radio):
Charlie 1-6.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.375
Incident B7655-- you want to
go ahead and call that...

29:03.409 --> 29:04.811
Okay, people, listen up.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.946
We are serving warrant

29:06.979 --> 29:09.548
on one Antoine Jacoby,

29:09.581 --> 29:12.518
our primary suspect, according
to Agent Harris's cross-checks.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.652
We're talking

29:13.685 --> 29:17.890
a large-scale manufacture
of NZT in this warehouse.

29:17.924 --> 29:20.326
We don't know how many
Jacoby's got in there with him,

29:20.359 --> 29:22.361
and we don't know
where they are,

29:22.394 --> 29:24.997
so carve up slices and fan out
wide, once we're in.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.867
I want
every nook and cranny checked.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.869
No surprises.

29:29.902 --> 29:33.205
(phone buzzing)
Any bright ideas,
questions or concerns?

29:33.239 --> 29:34.974
No, sir.
Happy hunting.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.408
Brian, it's not a good time.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.244
Listen, Clay Meeks
is Apocryphon.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.545
What are you talking about?
Where are you?

29:39.578 --> 29:41.814
I found Apocryphon!

29:41.848 --> 29:43.883
It's not exactly
what I was expecting,

29:43.916 --> 29:45.284
but this is definitely him.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.418
Wait, he's there with you?

29:46.452 --> 29:48.154
No, he slipped away!

29:48.187 --> 29:49.521
He's, like, a ninja person.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.123
And now he's
out there somewhere.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.591
Harris, we doing this?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.160
Yeah, I have to go.
We're moving in.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.028
No, but I'm telling you
you're making a mistake!

29:56.062 --> 29:57.429
I have to go.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.430
No, wait, wait, wait!

30:00.933 --> 30:02.134
Who was that?

30:02.168 --> 30:03.469
A source I'm working with.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.372
Are we sure Jacoby's
our guy on this?

30:06.405 --> 30:07.874
He's the guy.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.942
Why? Who's this source?

30:09.976 --> 30:13.479
Look, Harris, I trust your
instincts, I really do,

30:13.512 --> 30:16.415
but unless you can find a flaw
in the chain of evidence

30:16.448 --> 30:19.085
that's brought us all here,
how about we see this through?

30:25.157 --> 30:28.160
(thudding, crunching
in distance)

30:30.362 --> 30:31.230
(men shouting)
AGENT: Federal officers!

30:31.263 --> 30:33.132
AGENT 2: Hands up!
(shouting continues)

30:33.165 --> 30:34.433
Hands up! Let's see 'em!

30:34.466 --> 30:35.902
Get back from the table!

30:35.935 --> 30:37.169
Don't move!
Don't move!

30:37.203 --> 30:38.504
Him, turn him.
AGENT: Stay right there!

30:38.537 --> 30:40.072
Back away!
Back away!

30:40.106 --> 30:41.941
That's him.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.642
Antoine Jacoby?

30:43.675 --> 30:45.544
Yes?
What are we making here,
Mr. Jacoby?

30:45.577 --> 30:47.646
Cooking up some smart drugs?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.882
Maybe you should have
taken a dose yourself.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.517
You're under arrest
for the manufacture

30:51.550 --> 30:54.420
and distribution of a Schedule I
controlled substance.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.364
REBECCA: I can't believe
it's over, but it's over.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.366
Jacoby not only admitted
to putting NZT on the street,

31:07.399 --> 31:08.600
but he named names:

31:08.634 --> 31:13.272
Six people, including
Jarrod Sands.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.941
Who are the others?

31:14.974 --> 31:18.144
Um, Edgar Wilkes.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.312
(sirens whoops)
He was on Homeland Security.

31:20.346 --> 31:24.150
Deborah Hilgrad, former CIA op.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.618
Jonathan Reilly, big finance.

31:26.652 --> 31:27.853
Stay right there!
Leland Shawn,

31:27.886 --> 31:29.155
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
criminal defense attorney.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.992
And Amanda Crane. She's on a
weapons procurement committee.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.461
That's the entire
Legion of Whom.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.496
(sighs)

31:37.529 --> 31:39.966
I don't know who Clay Meeks is,

31:39.999 --> 31:42.468
but he could be a crackpot
conspiracy theorist,

31:42.501 --> 31:44.003
maybe?
No, I don't think so.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.271
I mean, he knew things.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.973
I think he knew things.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.976
(sighs)

31:50.009 --> 31:51.543
What? What is it?

31:51.577 --> 31:53.512
Just, I was wrong, you know.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.582
I don't understand
how that happened.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.518
Well, like I said,
the drug you took--

31:59.551 --> 32:01.553
it could've been cut
with something.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.289
It was untested.

32:03.322 --> 32:06.092
Or I just convinced myself I was
right because I wanted to be.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.493
(sighs)

32:07.526 --> 32:10.562
I don't know.
It was fun, you know?

32:10.596 --> 32:14.133
Investigating again,
chasing down leads.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.737
I guess I just got...
caught up in it.

32:18.770 --> 32:22.608
Well... bright side:

32:22.641 --> 32:24.510
Once we interrogate them,

32:24.543 --> 32:26.578
we'll be that much closer
to finding Piper.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.348
(sighs)
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.651
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

32:32.684 --> 32:34.653
SAC Pouran.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.056
Agent Boyle.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.558
As I told you before,
I've got nothing to say.

32:39.591 --> 32:42.995
Whatever reason you're here,
seems you've wasted your time.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.364
Silent treatment.
Makes sense if you think

32:45.397 --> 32:47.066
your team's gonna
ride in to rescue you.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.035
I do happen to know some
people who get things done.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.002
Well, here's the thing:

32:50.036 --> 32:51.470
This team you place
so much confidence in--

32:51.503 --> 32:53.472
they are now, one and all,
in federal custody.

32:55.674 --> 32:56.842
(quiet chuckle)

32:56.875 --> 32:59.611
It's okay. I didn't think
you'd just believe us on spec,

32:59.645 --> 33:01.280
so I brought along
some photographs.

33:03.249 --> 33:06.552
I know. It's upsetting.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.687
That's why I wanted you
to hear it from us.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.557
How did this happen?

33:11.590 --> 33:14.626
Do you have any idea
how many people have been hurt

33:14.660 --> 33:16.562
since you flooded
the city with NZT?

33:16.595 --> 33:18.664
How many people
have been killed?

33:18.697 --> 33:20.566
You got greedy.

33:20.599 --> 33:24.536
And in my experience,
greed makes you stupid.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.772
Whatever drug you happen

33:26.805 --> 33:29.007
to be abusing at the time.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.778
Wait.

33:32.811 --> 33:36.082
The plea arrangement
you talked about?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.349
Off the table. Sorry.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.118
Well, what about Piper Baird?

33:39.151 --> 33:40.686
Did your agents locate her?

33:42.588 --> 33:44.556
If you breathe life back
into the deal,

33:44.590 --> 33:46.425
I'll tell you where she is.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.594
And...

33:48.627 --> 33:52.831
I'm willing to testify,
in full...

33:52.864 --> 33:55.167
about my relationship
with the senator.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.169
Yeah.

33:57.203 --> 34:00.439
I will bring you the head
of Edward Morra.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.576
Now, what you got to say?

34:11.217 --> 34:12.684
BRIAN: How could one word
have led me so astray?

34:12.718 --> 34:14.786
I was no closer
to finding Piper,

34:14.820 --> 34:17.256
and I was driving myself crazy,
wondering where I went wrong,

34:17.289 --> 34:19.191
and why NZT had failed me.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.227
Maybe Rebecca was right.

34:21.260 --> 34:22.761
Was it weaker?

34:22.794 --> 34:24.796
Would taking more even help?

34:27.266 --> 34:28.700
Brian?
Dad.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.236
Hey.

34:30.269 --> 34:32.438
Everything all right?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.206
Uh, yeah.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.607
No, I'm-I'm just thinking.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.443
Where were you?

34:37.476 --> 34:41.313
Uh, well, I just
came from my guy.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.382
You know, the investigator
I told you about.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.716
Yeah. Did he find something?

34:45.751 --> 34:48.487
Nothing.
(sighs) Yeah.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.322
And he doesn't
think he will, Brian.

34:50.356 --> 34:52.158
What does that mean?

34:53.659 --> 34:56.728
You know, those people
that took her...

34:56.762 --> 34:57.729
Piper?
Mm-hmm.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.666
They are really
bad people, Brian.
I know.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.534
And I know you don't want to
hear this, and I don't want

35:02.568 --> 35:03.735
to be the one
to say this, but...

35:03.769 --> 35:07.539
he believes
Piper is gone.

35:07.573 --> 35:09.375
I'm sorry.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.446
You know, you were
the only one left,

35:14.480 --> 35:16.215
the only one who still
believed in this.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.849
And I want to.

35:17.883 --> 35:20.586
What if it were Mom?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.753
Or Rachel?

35:21.787 --> 35:24.256
Would you still be
telling me to give up?

35:24.290 --> 35:25.824
Brian,

35:25.857 --> 35:28.427
you are my son,
and I don't want to lose you

35:28.460 --> 35:30.796
chasing something that you're
probably never gonna find.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.564
And I don't want to have
this conversation

35:32.598 --> 35:34.900
with Mom or Rachel about you.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.837
Look, we can only work
with the information we have.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.840
And the information I have

35:41.873 --> 35:44.510
says that it's too late
for Piper.

35:44.543 --> 35:47.379
And NZT can't change that.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.547
It's not a magic bullet.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.284
Dad was only trying to help,
but he was wrong.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.586
NZT is a magic bullet,

35:54.620 --> 35:58.190
and the entire
Legion of Whom is on it.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.625
Which begs the question:

35:59.658 --> 36:02.661
how did the FBI
ferret them out so easily?

36:02.694 --> 36:04.830
Unless the Legion
wanted them to.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.433
Brian... talk.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.367
Talk to me.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.402
I know you're hurting.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.705
You know what? I just think
I need to spend

36:13.739 --> 36:16.942
some time alone right now,
if that's okay.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.378
Yeah.

36:21.247 --> 36:22.248
Sure.

36:26.752 --> 36:29.555
* One after the other

36:29.588 --> 36:33.992
* On the left side
of my heart... *

36:34.025 --> 36:36.295
I had one more chance
to get this right.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.597
We may have known the "who"
in the Legion of Whom,

36:38.630 --> 36:40.599
but I still
didn't know the why.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.634
*

36:44.903 --> 36:47.873
Senator Morra's plane will
depart from a private airfield

36:47.906 --> 36:49.441
in Farmington later today.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.243
You and I will be there
to intercept.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.845
We will take the senator
into custody for questioning

36:53.879 --> 36:55.547
regarding Jarrod Sands'
testimony.

36:55.581 --> 36:58.016
This is going to blow up into
a whole big thing, isn't it?

36:58.049 --> 36:58.950
(Naz sighs)

36:58.984 --> 37:01.820
FBI investigation
into a sitting senator?

37:01.853 --> 37:02.888
It might.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.022
So if we are doing this,

37:04.055 --> 37:05.924
I need to know
you're all on board.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.760
*

37:08.794 --> 37:10.496
Let's go roll him up.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.430
(latch clicks)

37:11.463 --> 37:14.533
*

37:16.435 --> 37:17.903
Here to see a prisoner.

37:17.936 --> 37:18.904
His name?

37:18.937 --> 37:19.971
Jarrod Sands.

37:21.707 --> 37:22.908
*

37:27.313 --> 37:28.914
(sirens approaching)

37:28.947 --> 37:31.016
*

37:39.691 --> 37:41.360
Can I help you?

37:41.393 --> 37:43.595
FBI. We're looking
for Senator Morra.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.397
Was he expecting you?
I doubt it.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.399
I'm sorry.
The senator's not here.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.834
This is his plane,
is it not?

37:48.867 --> 37:50.068
Last-minute
change of plans.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.437
He accepted
an invitation

37:51.470 --> 37:52.771
to fly with a friend
of the campaign.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.939
Fly where?

37:53.972 --> 37:55.040
Is there a problem?

37:55.073 --> 37:56.775
(crashing)

37:58.076 --> 37:59.945
Is this one of yours?
NAZ: Down, down, down.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.747
(horn blaring)

38:01.780 --> 38:04.583
(brakes screeching)

38:04.616 --> 38:07.018
Hey! Hey! It's me! It's me.
Don't shoot, all right?

38:07.052 --> 38:08.454
Stand down!
Whatever you tell these people

38:08.487 --> 38:10.689
so they don't kill me!
What the hell, Finch?

38:10.722 --> 38:12.924
I called you on the phone, why
didn't you answer your phone?
I was a little busy.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.860
Listen, I wasn't wrong,
about any of it.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.028
It wasn't Jacoby that put
all that NZT on the streets.

38:17.062 --> 38:20.332
It was Clay Meeks, like I said,
working for Sands.

38:20.366 --> 38:22.067
The NZT surge was
just a smokescreen,

38:22.100 --> 38:23.935
to create chaos.

38:23.969 --> 38:26.738
I mean, they wanted you
to increase your task force,

38:26.772 --> 38:28.474
they needed you to
bring in the DEA,

38:28.507 --> 38:31.977
because that is where they had
someone on the inside.

38:32.010 --> 38:32.944
Brewster.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.780
Brewster is one of them.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.115
I think he was on NZT,
but he hid it so well.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.084
No accelerated speech patterns,

38:39.117 --> 38:40.786
no tells whatsoever.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.088
But it's the only thing
that makes sense.

38:43.121 --> 38:45.524
Where is Brewster, by the way?

38:46.858 --> 38:48.860
*

39:03.675 --> 39:05.110
Jacoby... Jacoby.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.978
Brewster and Sands
steered us to Jacoby.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.580
BRIAN:
Yeah, Jacoby was a plant.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.048
All those people he gave up?

39:10.081 --> 39:13.419
Sands' Legion of Whatever?

39:13.452 --> 39:15.587
None of them worked for Sands.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.055
NAZ:
Then who are they?

39:17.088 --> 39:18.056
Well, that's what
I stayed up all night

39:18.089 --> 39:19.290
trying to figure out, all right?

39:19.324 --> 39:21.092
I have a model in the back
of the car, let me...
Brian!

39:21.126 --> 39:21.993
Who are they?

39:22.027 --> 39:23.962
They're Morra's people.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.964
His last remaining operatives.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.533
The people who were
in Sands' way.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.435
How did we miss this?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.503
Because you didn't have
anyone there to call it out.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.072
You didn't have anyone on NZT.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.074
And I kind of hate to say it,
but you didn't have me.

39:36.107 --> 39:39.545
(phones chiming, ringing)

39:39.578 --> 39:40.679
I don't know, Brian.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.047
(phone buzzing,
Brian muttering)

39:42.080 --> 39:44.182
We gotta go. We gotta go now.

39:44.215 --> 39:44.983
Are you coming?

39:45.016 --> 39:46.117
I don't know, am I?

39:46.151 --> 39:46.952
Just get in the car, Finch!

39:46.985 --> 39:49.488
*

39:52.057 --> 39:54.059
How the hell
did this happen?

39:54.092 --> 39:56.027
Brewster knew we were bringing
all the conspirators

39:56.061 --> 39:58.163
to the CJC for questioning

39:58.196 --> 40:00.432
and he used his credential

40:00.466 --> 40:02.100
to gain access
to the motor pool.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.571
Rigged some type of explosive
device beneath their van.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.106
It's a massacre.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.941
Everyone Brewster
rounded up.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.911
That's half of
Morra's core people.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.013
He had us do their work.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.015
So they could
slaughter them.

40:17.048 --> 40:20.452
