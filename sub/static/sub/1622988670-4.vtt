00:08.878 --> 00:11.315
<i>Three weeks ago,
ten brave individuals</i>

00:11.359 --> 00:14.014
<i>signed up for the adventure
of a lifetime</i>

00:14.057 --> 00:15.319
<i>to find true love.</i>

00:15.363 --> 00:17.191
<i>And tonight,
on the season finale</i>

00:17.234 --> 00:19.019
<i>of</i> Love in Bali,

00:19.062 --> 00:20.803
<i>there's only two suitors left.</i>

00:20.846 --> 00:22.892
<i>Who will Trina choose?</i>

00:22.935 --> 00:24.546
<i>Danny, the cowboy from Montana,</i>

00:24.589 --> 00:27.114
<i>or Nick, the day trader
from Manhattan?</i>

00:27.157 --> 00:29.551
<i>We're down
to the final decision.</i>

00:29.594 --> 00:30.726
Oh, God.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.336
She's going to choose Nick,
isn't she?

00:32.380 --> 00:34.034
<i>-...middle of the country</i>

00:34.077 --> 00:35.165
<i>is right in the middle again.</i>

00:39.909 --> 00:41.041
Who is it?

00:41.084 --> 00:42.477
Someone good!

00:55.403 --> 00:57.709
See? Didn't I tell you?

00:57.753 --> 00:59.015
Someone good.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.104
Mr. Lester, uh...

01:01.148 --> 01:02.062
What do you need?

01:02.105 --> 01:04.020
Conversation.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.195
Can I come in?

01:05.239 --> 01:07.545
I'd rather
it was during work hours.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.156
You know, I would too.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.854
But we have just, uh, 12 minutes

01:11.897 --> 01:14.770
to discuss an important issue.

01:30.699 --> 01:31.830
Please...

01:31.874 --> 01:33.702
-Come in.
-Thank you.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.921
Well, well.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.750
So, this is...

01:38.794 --> 01:40.143
an apartment.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.884
Yeah.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.755
-Student loans.
-Yes.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.714
Uh, you said 12 minutes.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.803
Yes. So, now...

01:47.846 --> 01:50.066
Where is this? Um...

01:50.110 --> 01:52.112
Let's see.

01:52.155 --> 01:55.419
-That's my orthodontist
appointment.
-Um...

01:55.463 --> 01:58.030
This is my pizza.
Why do I have that?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.165
Is this about Mr. Rivi?

02:02.209 --> 02:04.428
Yes. Uh, and no.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.865
Oh, here it is.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.867
See, I really should keep

02:08.911 --> 02:10.304
the new ones on top.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.044
-Uh, it, uh...
-It would make my life...

02:12.088 --> 02:13.263
so much easier.

02:13.307 --> 02:14.743
What does Mr. Rivi need?

02:14.786 --> 02:16.484
Well,
that's what our conversation

02:16.527 --> 02:17.746
is going to be about.

02:17.789 --> 02:20.705
See, Oscar likes to help
his friends.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.533
And he considers you
a friend now.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.840
Oh, I don't need any friends,
Mr. Lester.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.233
Well, you do on this one.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.799
First...

02:27.843 --> 02:29.845
you can't tell anyone
I was here,

02:29.888 --> 02:31.107
or how you heard this.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.065
You have to promise me.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.110
Promise.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.417
You said that too fast.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.810
Think about it, then promise.

02:41.509 --> 02:42.510
Promise.

02:42.553 --> 02:43.859
Good.

02:43.902 --> 02:47.210
So, Oscar has friends
in the police department,

02:47.254 --> 02:49.821
and in about ten minutes,

02:49.865 --> 02:52.084
a search warrant
is going to be served

02:52.128 --> 02:53.695
on someone close to you.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.653
-Who?
-Someone at your firm.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.177
-It... Yeah, who?
-Now,

02:57.220 --> 02:59.962
the police are not actually
serving the warrant.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.355
The FBI is.

03:01.398 --> 03:02.834
And that's how Oscar
got the information.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.663
Because the police
hate the Feds.

03:05.707 --> 03:08.753
-And-and who is being served?
-Well, let me see.

03:08.797 --> 03:12.148
Uh, I have this
on one of these notes.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.019
What? Exercises?

03:14.063 --> 03:15.543
Yes.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.328
Bad back? Because I have a,
uh, a chiropractor...

03:18.372 --> 03:21.288
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no. No. No.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.681
But why are you doing exercises?

03:24.465 --> 03:26.031
I get migraines.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.468
It-It helps with them.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.947
I'm so sorry.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.733
You know,
my mom got terrible migraines.

03:31.776 --> 03:35.345
She would lie on the floor
for hours and cry.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.260
It was very sad.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.348
Oh. Here.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.523
Diane Lockhart.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.221
That's who's being served,

03:41.264 --> 03:43.223
in about nine minutes.

03:44.006 --> 03:46.356
You can't tell her
how you know this.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.488
You promised.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.141
And be sure to tell her,

03:49.185 --> 03:51.405
be very careful

03:51.448 --> 03:54.016
about any documents
pertaining to Oscar.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.338
Oh, shit.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.606
Ow.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.306
If this can wait until tomorrow,

04:23.350 --> 04:24.873
-please hang up right now. <i>
Ms. Lockhart,</i>

04:24.916 --> 04:27.136
I'm sorry.
This-this can't wait.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.051
-Who is this? <i>
-Carmen.</i>

04:29.094 --> 04:30.922
Moyo, your new associate.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.533
-Okay. What is it, Carmen?

04:32.576 --> 04:35.013
<i>Uh, I can't tell you
how I know this,</i>

04:35.057 --> 04:37.581
but in eight minutes,
the FBI is going to be serving

04:37.625 --> 04:38.974
a search warrant
on your residence.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.368
Where'd you...
Where did you get this?

04:41.411 --> 04:43.065
<i>I've been told I can't say.</i>

04:43.108 --> 04:44.240
Rivi?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.720
Ms. Lockhart...

04:45.763 --> 04:47.548
<i>Well, uh...
What are they searching for?</i>

04:47.591 --> 04:49.201
I wasn't told.

04:49.245 --> 04:51.769
But they're sure that we're,
we're being served tonight?

04:52.596 --> 04:54.294
-Yes. <i>
-Okay. Thanks.</i>

04:55.991 --> 04:58.733
-Work?
-That was an associate
saying that in eight minutes,

04:58.776 --> 05:01.475
our house is going
to be searched by the FBI.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.606
Do you believe him?

05:02.650 --> 05:04.391
Her. I don't know. Maybe.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.654
-Eight minutes?

05:08.003 --> 05:10.222
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

05:11.006 --> 05:13.400
-Don't!
-No. I'm going to lock it up.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.533
Liz, I'm sorry to bother you.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.319
Diane, can this wait?

05:19.362 --> 05:21.146
I don't think it can.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.453
The new associate, Carmen,

05:23.497 --> 05:25.325
she called with a tip saying

05:25.368 --> 05:27.327
that the FBI is executing
a search warrant

05:27.370 --> 05:28.676
on our house in a few minutes.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.373
Wait. What... What?

05:30.417 --> 05:31.809
Wh-Where did she get the...

05:31.853 --> 05:33.420
-where did she get the tip? <i>
-I don't know.</i>

05:33.463 --> 05:35.639
She couldn't say. Rivi?

05:35.683 --> 05:37.685
Uh, yeah, or-or Wolfe-Coleman.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.164
-Oh, my God.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.689
She's tangled up with
some rough characters.

05:41.732 --> 05:42.864
I mean...

05:42.907 --> 05:44.300
All right, you know what?
We need to...

05:44.344 --> 05:45.519
we need to, um....

05:45.562 --> 05:47.216
We need to, uh,
purge your files

05:47.259 --> 05:49.261
'cause the FBI are always...

05:52.221 --> 05:53.483
What?

05:53.527 --> 05:55.180
<i>Nothing. Nothing.</i>

05:55.224 --> 05:56.878
<i>The-the Feds are always trying</i>

05:56.921 --> 05:58.575
<i>-to pierce attorney-client...
-What is that?</i>

05:58.619 --> 06:00.664
<i>-Uh, pierce...
-Nothing.</i>

06:00.708 --> 06:02.187
Kurt, what is that?

06:02.231 --> 06:03.319
<i>-...attorney-client privilege.
-Business.</i>

06:03.363 --> 06:04.451
<i>So, uh, we need, we need</i>

06:04.494 --> 06:05.800
to get your files purged.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.062
You know what? Hold on.
I'm just gonna...

06:07.105 --> 06:08.106
I'm gonna...

06:08.150 --> 06:09.847
I'm gonna loop in Jay.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.327
Okay?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.034
Hello?

06:23.078 --> 06:24.296
Hello.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.820
<i>Jay, hey. Um...</i>

06:25.863 --> 06:27.387
It's Liz. I have Diane with me.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.997
We need to purge her computer.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.565
Supposedly, we're being searched
in a few minutes by the FBI.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.654
The life of a nation is secure

06:33.697 --> 06:36.178
only when that nation is honest.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.836
Okay.

06:41.879 --> 06:42.793
Diane,

06:42.837 --> 06:44.404
<i>is your laptop powered up?</i>

06:44.447 --> 06:45.622
Yes.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.450
Now what are you doing?

06:47.494 --> 06:49.757
ATF advice on when
you're searched.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.498
<i>Diane...</i>

06:51.541 --> 06:54.326
I wrote a PowerShell script
that can delete work files,

06:54.370 --> 06:55.763
but you need to access it

06:55.806 --> 06:57.068
<i>through the "newfolder" path.</i>

06:57.112 --> 06:58.026
What does that mean?

06:58.069 --> 06:59.419
-A man is worked upon...
-Shh.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.724
-by what he works on.
-Shh!

07:00.768 --> 07:02.422
Jay, what does that mean?

07:02.465 --> 07:04.424
<i>Don't you sleep?
-Oh, can't a brother see 'em?</i>

07:04.467 --> 07:05.947
Shh. <i>
Just hold the "Pause"
button down...</i>

07:05.990 --> 07:07.514
...by his circumstances,
the circumstances...

07:07.557 --> 07:08.645
Hit restart
and press "Command" and "R."

07:08.689 --> 07:09.777
...will carve him out, as well.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.300
<i>Shh.
-Uh...</i>

07:12.867 --> 07:14.434
-All right, got it. <i>
-When you see the logo,</i>

07:14.477 --> 07:15.913
-let go.
-...any people will quietly
submit to...

07:15.957 --> 07:17.088
When you see
a recovery mode menu...

07:17.132 --> 07:18.916
...and you have
the exact measure

07:18.960 --> 07:20.178
-of the injustice and wrong...
-...choose "Disk Utility,"

07:20.222 --> 07:21.876
then "Erase," then "Quit...

07:21.919 --> 07:23.007
-Disk Utility"!
-...which would be imposed
upon them.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.705
All right. Oy.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.576
<i>Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.</i>

07:26.620 --> 07:28.360
-Diane. Diane.
-Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.884
-Diane. <i>
-What?</i>

07:29.927 --> 07:33.017
When Boseman left, you were, um,
you working remotely,

07:33.061 --> 07:35.455
<i>and so we printed out all your
files and sent them to you.</i>

07:35.498 --> 07:37.761
Oh, my God.
I've got five boxes here.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.808
The shredding service
was supposed to pick them up.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.987
Wha-- Oh, shit.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.684
Federal agents.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.643
-Here to serve a search warrant.
Liz, I'm-I'm

07:49.686 --> 07:51.775
-going to need you
to take my 9:00 a.m.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.777
<i>-What? Why?
-The Feds are going to want
to review my hard copies.</i>

07:53.821 --> 07:55.779
-I'll need to get to court.

07:55.823 --> 07:57.781
-It's this
build-your-own-court guy. <i>
-Who?</i>

07:57.825 --> 07:59.217
-Hal Wackner.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.784
<i>He just wants
to know how courts work.</i>

08:00.828 --> 08:03.221
Just give him a half hour
and cut him loose.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.571
Okay?

08:12.448 --> 08:14.537
Diane Lockhart.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.452
What a small world.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.975
It's Nancy Crozier, remember?

08:18.019 --> 08:20.282
-I'm working as an AUSA now.
-Yes.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.414
-I'm, uh, sorry about that.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.330
Balthazar, would you mind?

08:25.374 --> 08:26.810
All right.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.987
Oh. Sorry.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.207
And we will keep
an accounting of any breakage.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.470
I would have picked it up
myself. I'm just, um...

08:34.514 --> 08:36.603
I'm four months pregnant.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.912
I have a, uh, duly-authorized
search warrant here

08:41.956 --> 08:44.262
that gives us the right to
enter and search the premises.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.134
If this is about my work,

08:46.177 --> 08:47.614
-these materials are covered
by attorney-client privilege.
-No.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.051
Actually, it's,
it's about your husband.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.881
Sir, I am here to serve you
with a search warrant.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.768
Ms. Reddick, how are you?

10:38.812 --> 10:40.596
Good, Mr. Cooper. How are you?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.946
Good. Shall we begin?

10:45.079 --> 10:46.123
Oh.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.691
I'm taking Diane's 9:00.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.432
So, just call me
when he gets here.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.955
It's some judge guy.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.791
You said the, uh, restroom is
down the hall to the right?

11:01.835 --> 11:03.271
Yeah.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.299
Excuse me.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.127
Where am I supposed to go
for the staff meeting?

11:33.170 --> 11:35.825
The partner meeting
or the associate one?

11:35.869 --> 11:37.261
Whichever's more interesting.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.959
I only know about
the associate one.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.917
That's where I want to go.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.572
Thank you.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.706
-Who is he?
-I don't know. Why?

11:46.749 --> 11:48.620
Um, he's coming to our daily.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.231
Oh, is that the STR Laurie guy?

11:50.274 --> 11:52.320
He's reviewing who was kept on
after the firings.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.539
Oh, God. I don't think
I was nice to him.

11:54.583 --> 11:58.108
-Well, he can't fire you
because you weren't very nice.
-Yes, he can.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.196
Mm.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.159
<i>People always think
I'm a lesbian.</i>

12:05.202 --> 12:07.161
And some people won't ask me.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.946
They do non-verbal
communication communication.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.556
I can tell they're trying to ask
if I'm a lesbian.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.821
They look at me and they go,
"Are you, uh...

12:14.864 --> 12:16.213
They do, like, a wiggle.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.780
They're like,
"Are you a little, uh..."

12:17.824 --> 12:18.999
Ah... you know.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.261
And I always play dumb,
I'm like,

12:20.304 --> 12:21.697
I don't know, have Parkinson's?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.786
They're like, "No, you know..."

12:23.830 --> 12:25.048
I've got a boyfriend.
He's awesome.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.615
I love him so much.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.877
We met online.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.574
He is Nigerian.

12:29.618 --> 12:30.793
Mm-hmm.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.926
He's a prince. I swear to God.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.928
A Nigerian prince.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.799
And he gets me to do things,

12:36.843 --> 12:38.888
ooh, I never thought I would do.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.629
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

12:40.672 --> 12:42.544
<i>You know how they call Nigeria</i>

12:42.587 --> 12:45.242
<i>-a shithole country?</i>

12:45.286 --> 12:46.809
Very funny.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.332
Though maybe problematic.

12:48.376 --> 12:51.074
Morgan's act is edgy,
and that's what we want.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.728
But now, someone's posted
this video online,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.686
and, uh, we're getting
a lot of Twitter pushback.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.732
Ah. So, you're worried
about being cancelled?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.865
Ooh. Ooh.
Don't say the "C" word.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.302
-But, uh, yeah.
Well...

13:01.345 --> 13:02.782
We want your business,
Mr. Cooper.

13:02.825 --> 13:03.957
You want us to sue.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.349
We're ready.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.351
No, I want you to do
a sensitivity read.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.875
Really?

13:08.918 --> 13:11.573
Yes. We have an $8 million
contract to stream her act.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.619
So, we want you
to review her set for...

13:14.663 --> 13:16.578
cultural inaccuracies,

13:16.621 --> 13:18.798
representation issues, bias,

13:18.841 --> 13:21.713
stereotypes, problematic
language, blah, blah, blah.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.586
And, uh, why us?

13:24.629 --> 13:27.763
Well, clearly because we're one
of the best firms in Chicago.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.112
Because you're a Black firm,

13:29.156 --> 13:31.419
and most of Morgan's jokes touch
on racial themes.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.160
And we were thinking
of bringing you

13:33.203 --> 13:34.770
all of our
legal business anyway, so...

13:34.814 --> 13:37.947
this may be a good way
to take you for a test drive.

13:37.991 --> 13:41.864
Well, I think you'll find us
street ready.

13:43.648 --> 13:47.000
And uh, hey, we wouldn't mind
if Morgan's act stayed funny.

13:47.043 --> 13:50.046
Right? We have over
200 million subscribers.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.657
-Somebody somewhere
is always gonna be offended.
Okay.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.137
How soon do you need this?

13:54.181 --> 13:56.009
-Day after tomorrow.
-Ah.

13:56.052 --> 13:58.011
I've been told you,
uh, work fast.

13:59.447 --> 14:01.405
Uh, well, we...
We do our best.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.277
Oh, excuse me.
I need to...

14:03.320 --> 14:04.974
-I need to get this.
-Yes, ma'am.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.149
I'll be in touch.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.195
Hey. You still in court?

14:08.238 --> 14:09.805
Yeah. They're delaying us.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.372
<i>Us? What do you mean, "us"?</i>

14:11.415 --> 14:13.591
The search warrant
wasn't about me.

14:13.635 --> 14:14.679
It was about Kurt.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.551
Kurt? Why?

14:16.594 --> 14:18.074
January 6.

14:18.118 --> 14:21.686
Some veterans he took shooting
stormed the Capitol.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.166
Oh, my God.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.559
Yeah.
So, this could take a while.

14:24.602 --> 14:27.127
-And you're defending Kurt? <i>
-Yes.</i>

14:27.170 --> 14:28.955
How did my 9:00 go?

14:28.998 --> 14:31.522
Why are you being so casual
with him?

14:31.566 --> 14:33.350
That is Del Cooper.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.657
-We want his streaming business.
-David, I am on the phone.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.137
-Oh, I thought
you were ignoring me.
-Can we just deal

14:37.180 --> 14:38.051
-with this later, please?
-Oh, as in...

14:38.094 --> 14:39.879
when you lose the client?

14:39.922 --> 14:41.837
-Priorities, Liz.
-All right, sorry.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.143
Uh, yeah. Your 9:00,

14:43.186 --> 14:44.884
the kooky court guy,
he didn't show up.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.582
Yes. Well, he may arrive late.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.192
He's unpredictable.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.194
We're tight on paralegal hours.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.587
So make sure you keep track,

14:52.630 --> 14:54.850
and we'll divvy up
at the end of the week.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.504
Well, I think we should
give seniority to the associate

14:56.547 --> 14:57.940
-with the most billable hours.
-I would agree.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.029
But I think it should be
billable hours

15:00.073 --> 15:02.379
over a whole quarter,
not just the month.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.338
What are you two talking about?

15:04.381 --> 15:07.558
I just want to be clear
for our fact-finding guest

15:07.602 --> 15:10.126
-how we do things here.
-Oh, don't mind me.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.738
-Is there any way we can help
with your fact-finding, Mr...
-Wackner.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.524
I guess, uh...
I don't want to interrupt.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.918
-No, don't worry. Please.
-Please.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.312
Well, I do have questions
about jury trials.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.705
-Oh, of course.
-There's a lot of issues.

15:23.748 --> 15:24.967
-That's definitely...
-Jury selection...

15:25.011 --> 15:26.751
Those files are covered

15:26.795 --> 15:28.971
by attorney-client privilege,
Your Honor.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.930
My agents smelled wh...

15:32.279 --> 15:33.628
Sorry. One second.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.587
Just... Phew.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.417
False alarm.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.593
My agents smelled
recent burning activity,

15:42.637 --> 15:44.639
and found ashes
in the fireplace.

15:44.682 --> 15:47.076
From my husband and I
enjoying a fire.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.860
Well, they saw no evidence
of firewood.

15:48.904 --> 15:51.298
Yes, which is what happens
when you burn firewood.

15:51.341 --> 15:52.821
Your Honor,
this is not the issue.

15:52.864 --> 15:56.259
The issue is that
we need to review the contents

15:56.303 --> 15:58.000
of these boxes that
Ms. Lockhart tried to burn.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.436
-Objection.
-Sustained.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.003
Any review would pierce

16:01.047 --> 16:03.440
attorney-client privilege,
Your Honor.

16:03.484 --> 16:06.008
Ms. Crozier, help me understand.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.837
Your warrant was
for Mr. McVeigh.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.273
Yes?

16:10.317 --> 16:13.189
Then why do we need to review
all the boxes?

16:13.233 --> 16:15.626
Okay.

16:15.670 --> 16:19.804
Unfortunately, and I'm
very embarrassed to admit this,

16:19.848 --> 16:21.676
but... I'm pregnant.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.983
Four months. It's a girl.

16:24.026 --> 16:27.203
We decided on the name Tabitha.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.726
Very nice. Very nice.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.642
I love it when we get to
share these private moments.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.253
I'm sorry, the point.

16:33.296 --> 16:36.865
I was, uh, carrying files
pertaining to Mr. McVeigh

16:36.908 --> 16:38.388
and I slipped.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.435
Oh, my God. Are we really
doing this, Your Honor?

16:41.478 --> 16:42.914
If I could continue.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.308
I slipped and
Mr. McVeigh's files got mingled

16:45.352 --> 16:46.918
-in with Ms. Lockhart's.
Oh, yes.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.877
I hate when that happens.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.574
Unfortunately, the Bureau
now needs to go through

16:50.618 --> 16:53.316
all the files to distinguish
which is applicable

16:53.360 --> 16:54.491
to our search warrant.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.102
-Your Honor...
-No. No. No.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.147
You don't have to do that.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.193
The court will appoint
a neutral official

17:00.236 --> 17:04.675
who will review
and separate the files.

17:04.719 --> 17:05.937
No one's happy.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.809
Perfect.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.942
Diane.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.858
Such a pleasure
to face you in court today.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.077
Do you have a minute?

17:15.121 --> 17:17.079
-Ms. Crozier...
-Oh, Nancy's fine.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.820
This is the moment
when you impress me

17:18.863 --> 17:21.344
with all the evidence
you have against my husband

17:21.388 --> 17:23.390
and suggest he cop a plea.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.131
So we can do that right here.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.741
Certainly.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.049
Dylan Pike says that Kurt
is not only concealing

17:30.092 --> 17:31.876
the names of insurrectionists,

17:31.920 --> 17:35.228
but that he was the ringleader
of those insurrectionists.

17:35.271 --> 17:36.881
Really?

17:36.925 --> 17:39.362
The accused man
you threatened with prison

17:39.406 --> 17:41.712
threw somebody else under
the bus? How novel.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.106
Hi, Diane. I'm heading
to Judge Leon's court.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.195
Hi, Diane.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.371
Whoop. Sorry.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.417
Diane.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.201
If I were your husband,
I would talk.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.203
Mr. Pike seemed very convincing.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.770
And we know
how these things work.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.511
The first person who talks
gets a deal.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.600
The last person who talks
gets prison.

18:00.383 --> 18:03.256
20 years, to be specific.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.447
So, I think it's time to talk.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.104
It wasn't a legal issue.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.280
It was something for work.

18:29.064 --> 18:32.502
If you're keeping it from
the FBI, it's a legal issue.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.421
Are you not telling me
because I'm your lawyer,

18:38.465 --> 18:40.771
or because I'm your wife?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.600
Because of your politics.

18:43.644 --> 18:44.949
Oh, come on.

18:46.429 --> 18:49.432
Turning in insurrectionists
should be our politics.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.391
Diane, this works between us

18:51.434 --> 18:53.654
because we don't let
our political judgements

18:53.697 --> 18:56.178
overwhelm our respect
for each other.

18:59.094 --> 19:02.445
Kurt, I lived through
eight years of the Tea Party

19:02.489 --> 19:04.665
and four years of Trump,

19:04.708 --> 19:06.710
but January 6...

19:07.494 --> 19:09.148
I mean, that, that....

19:09.191 --> 19:11.324
that changed everything for me.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.937
I can't treat this
like a chess game anymore.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.200
And what is a chess game here?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.680
Us?

19:20.768 --> 19:21.812
This marriage?

19:21.856 --> 19:22.944
No.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.166
That's the one thing
that's not a game.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.522
It was a list
of the 80 members

19:35.565 --> 19:37.306
of the Gun and Ammo club.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.178
That's what I burned.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.744
They're not insurrectionists.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.312
But I know that the FBI
would treat them like they were.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.053
And I swear to you,
I would protect them

19:45.096 --> 19:48.926
just like I would protect
your book-group friends.

20:04.986 --> 20:09.295
All right, so, we're going
to go through it page by page.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.471
And, uh, if anybody has
any problems,

20:11.514 --> 20:13.037
just stop me. Okay?

20:13.081 --> 20:14.648
Remember,
streaming is the future.

20:14.691 --> 20:16.867
-So don't fuck around.
-Wow.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.217
Very inspiring, David.
Thank you.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.392
Inspiring words.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.611
Okay. Here we go.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.439
"If it looks like
I'm walking funny,

20:23.483 --> 20:25.528
you have to understand
my boyfriend is Nigerian."

20:25.572 --> 20:26.616
Stop.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.270
She's objectifying Black men.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.359
Yes. Although in this case,
I don't mind.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.579
It doesn't matter if you mind.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.537
-It's racially insensitive.
-Oh...

20:34.581 --> 20:36.713
Even though her boyfriend <i>
is</i> Nigerian?

20:36.757 --> 20:38.106
That doesn't matter, either.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.847
Something can be true
and racially insensitive

20:39.890 --> 20:42.980
if she generalizes from
a specific to a universal.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.721
But how is she doing that?

20:44.765 --> 20:47.420
The joke is based on the
audience's shared understanding

20:47.463 --> 20:50.118
-of a stereotype.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.424
Okay. Okay. Enough.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.729
-Let's try to focus.
-Okay. Hello.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.383
Wait. Now, let's be positive.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.255
All right?
Now, let's-let's-let's think.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.387
Is there anything that we could
throw in there that wouldn't

20:58.431 --> 20:59.736
throw off the rhythm?

20:59.780 --> 21:01.260
-You know, rhythm is important.
-Yeah.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.087
Norwegian.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.568
Why would she be walking funny
if her boyfriend was Norwegian?

21:05.612 --> 21:07.570
You know what they say
about those Norwegians.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.572
-Okay, fine.
Then think of something better.
-Do you even understand

21:09.616 --> 21:10.660
-what this is?
-If you're so worried about

21:10.704 --> 21:12.096
offending people on Twitter,

21:12.140 --> 21:14.142
how about the Amish?
They don't tweet much.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.449
That's a religion. You don't
make fun of a person's religion.

21:16.492 --> 21:17.885
-I was joking.
All right.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.234
If you have to explain
that you're joking,

21:19.278 --> 21:20.366
-it's not a joke.
-Is that so?

21:21.671 --> 21:23.630
Okay, Jay, I need you
to look into two things.

21:23.673 --> 21:26.328
First, this man, Dylan Pike.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.374
-Kurt's friend?
-They are not friends.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.376
They're...
I don't know what they are.

21:30.419 --> 21:34.902
But I need to know if he's
actually trying to set Kurt up

21:34.945 --> 21:37.861
as a ringleader
of the insurrectionists.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.299
-I know.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.517
Ms. Lockhart,
you wanted to see me?

21:41.561 --> 21:43.214
Yes, come on in. Thank you, Jay.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.607
Good luck.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.870
Carmen,
I need to congratulate you

21:46.914 --> 21:48.611
on hitting the ground
running here.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.396
And I need to know...

21:50.439 --> 21:52.702
who told you
about the search warrant?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.617
I was asked to not divulge.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.140
You cannot be asked that.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.143
I am covered by the same
attorney-client privilege

21:59.187 --> 22:00.623
that covers you.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.712
It's my understanding
that the search warrant

22:02.756 --> 22:04.584
was actually served
on another case.

22:04.627 --> 22:07.630
Not one of mine,
one regarding your husband.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.328
So this came from Rivi?

22:10.503 --> 22:11.591
I apologize.

22:11.634 --> 22:12.983
I can't confirm that.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.724
Carmen,
you have been here three weeks.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.683
You have two clients,
Wolfe-Coleman and Oscar Rivi.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.075
It's one or the other.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.254
Can I make a phone call,
Ms. Lockhart?

22:23.298 --> 22:25.735
-I think that would be smart.
-Diane, you wanted me?

22:25.779 --> 22:27.955
What is going on
with your crazy court judge?

22:27.998 --> 22:29.173
My...?

22:29.217 --> 22:31.567
Marissa, I am in no mood
for defensiveness.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.177
Wackner missed
his 9:00 a.m. meeting,

22:33.221 --> 22:36.311
and then I see him
in federal court shadowing Leah.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.008
He... What?

22:38.052 --> 22:39.445
Find out
what is going on with him.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.882
I can't have him
out there freelancing.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.902
Welcome, one. Welcome, all.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.121
I need everybody to pipe down,
please.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.949
Don't make me use my gavel.

23:05.993 --> 23:09.518
Okay, I need all prospective
jurors to line up

23:09.562 --> 23:11.302
against the brand-new,
beautiful jury box,

23:11.346 --> 23:12.869
shortest to tallest.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.697
Dean will give you your numbers.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.482
Right this way, folks.

23:16.525 --> 23:17.526
There's my muse.

23:17.570 --> 23:18.919
In chambers?

23:21.574 --> 23:23.140
So, juries now?

23:23.184 --> 23:25.969
Yeah, I was inspired
by your firm.

23:26.013 --> 23:32.149
Your associates told me about
how juries are racially biased.

23:32.193 --> 23:33.412
I'm trying to correct it.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.761
Our associates?

23:34.804 --> 23:36.240
My boss said
you didn't make your 9:00 a.m.

23:36.284 --> 23:37.764
No, I did.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.200
I waited.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.420
And then I decided to take
my own fact-finding tour.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.509
-What does that mean?
-Whenever you're kept waiting,

23:43.552 --> 23:45.119
ask the receptionist
where the restroom is.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.208
When they say, "Turn right
at the end of the hall,"

23:47.251 --> 23:48.427
turn left.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.604
I saw your sign outside.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.432
-Oh. It's looking good. Yeah?
-And the bench.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.955
-Spiffier.
-Yeah.

23:54.998 --> 23:56.435
Where's the money coming from?

23:56.478 --> 23:57.610
A sympathetic donor.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.046
Come on, help me out here.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.091
It's a jury trial, so wh...
What do I do?

24:01.135 --> 24:03.050
One thing I've learned
about you, Judge.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.356
You just pretend to be dumb to
get everyone around you to talk.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.271
So talk.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.970
Uh. Well, what's the case?

24:10.013 --> 24:11.580
NFT fraud.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.103
I don't know what that is.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.105
Non-fungible token.

24:15.149 --> 24:17.281
Someone sold a painting
that was a NFT fake.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.762
And they're suing them
for $4 million.

24:19.806 --> 24:22.765
You're hearing a case
involving $4 million?

24:22.809 --> 24:24.941
-It's a jury trial.
-Okay, but that's...

24:24.985 --> 24:26.377
Wh... how...

24:26.421 --> 24:29.250
This was cute
when it was the People's Court.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.687
But why would anybody agree
to let you decide?

24:31.731 --> 24:33.123
Signed and notarized.

24:33.167 --> 24:36.823
Both sides will honor
the jury's verdict.

24:36.866 --> 24:40.304
But this was notarized
in your fictional court,

24:40.348 --> 24:42.611
by you, about a fictional case.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.352
About a fictional crime.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.006
Faking a NFT.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.489
-Marissa...

24:51.968 --> 24:55.276
It seems there are
some last remaining brain cells

24:55.319 --> 24:58.018
in there that are unwilling
to climb on board.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.108
This is a court.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.111
In fact,
it is better than a court.

25:05.373 --> 25:09.856
A court is defined
by the justice it administers...

25:11.597 --> 25:14.338
...not by the ceremony
it displays.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.515
That's not Shakespeare.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.560
'Tis <i>moi.</i>

25:19.909 --> 25:20.867
So...

25:20.910 --> 25:22.738
Come on.

25:23.565 --> 25:24.958
I, uh...

25:25.001 --> 25:27.090
I bought your services
from your law firm.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.788
I have a chair
for you out there.

25:28.831 --> 25:30.877
Has your name on it.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.010
What else do you need?

25:38.754 --> 25:40.147
You like it?

25:41.104 --> 25:42.323
All righty.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.717
Good job.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.242
Juror number five,
step forward, please.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.244
Turn around.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.159
Raise your hands.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.944
-What's the name?
-Michael from Wicker Park.

25:54.988 --> 25:58.382
Michael, do you know the words
to the National Anthem?

25:58.426 --> 25:59.558
Yes.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.907
Okay, let's hear it.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.822
-Now?
-Yeah.

26:04.171 --> 26:07.043
♪ <i>Oh, say can you see</i>♪

26:07.087 --> 26:09.393
♪ <i>By the dawn's early light</i>♪

26:09.437 --> 26:12.353
♪ <i>By the...</i>♪

26:12.396 --> 26:14.311
♪ <i>Um...</i>♪

26:14.355 --> 26:17.010
Liar. Dean, kick him.

26:17.053 --> 26:19.229
Okay.

26:19.273 --> 26:20.840
Juror number one.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.406
Step forward, please.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.452
-what's your name, young lady?
-Gina from Logan Square.

26:24.495 --> 26:25.888
Hello, Gina from Logan Square.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.411
Do you know the words
to the National Anthem?

26:27.455 --> 26:29.283
I... don't.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.720
Do you know of
the third question

26:31.764 --> 26:33.417
asked of King Arthur
in the Holy Grail?

26:33.461 --> 26:35.419
Is this a Monty Python question?

26:35.463 --> 26:36.899
Because I hate Monty Python.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.119
Oh, that's unfortunate.
I love it.

26:40.468 --> 26:41.643
Does that change your mind?

26:41.687 --> 26:42.949
No.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.951
Take your place in the jury box.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.431
What do we got here?

26:47.475 --> 26:49.999
Um, number seven.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.871
Do you know who
Jerry Garcia was named after?

26:51.914 --> 26:53.307
I... um...

26:53.350 --> 26:55.265
Jerome Kern.

26:58.878 --> 27:00.227
What can she make fun of?

27:00.270 --> 27:01.750
Make him Brazilian.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.100
It's the right rhythm,
and they're burning the Amazon.

27:04.144 --> 27:05.928
No one will care.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.103
-They're Hispanic.
-Latinx.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.583
-Oh, my God.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.758
Look who's in there.

27:09.802 --> 27:11.020
They're old.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.935
Plus, none of us
go to comedy clubs.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.459
We don't know stand-up,
and we're not funny.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.592
-I'm funny.
-Liz, you're--

27:17.636 --> 27:19.463
you're a brilliant lawyer,
but, nothing personal,

27:19.507 --> 27:21.117
you're not a barrel of laughs.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.294
Hey, Diane, Jay thinks that we
need younger people in there.

27:24.338 --> 27:25.600
Oh, God. Yes.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.167
So, I'll get the mail room.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.430
Okay, but you really think
I'm not funny?

27:30.431 --> 27:32.433
No offense.

27:34.522 --> 27:35.828
Um, listen.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.657
I think you should
be in on this meeting.

27:39.483 --> 27:40.876
What meeting?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.965
Let's talk hypothetically,

27:43.009 --> 27:44.706
shall we, for a moment?

27:44.750 --> 27:45.838
If that helps.

27:45.881 --> 27:48.101
Let's say I have a client

27:48.144 --> 27:52.845
who receives information
from people who are not fans

27:52.888 --> 27:55.978
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.198
-Okay?
-And let's say...

27:58.241 --> 28:01.462
that he worries,
this unnamed client,

28:01.505 --> 28:04.204
that the investigation
of your husband

28:04.247 --> 28:09.078
might actually be a smoke screen
for coming after him.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.255
Has something happened?

28:12.299 --> 28:13.517
Hypothetically.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.824
Well, there is
a new piece of information,

28:15.868 --> 28:19.001
and I'd like to share it
with the two of you.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.742
But let me start by saying,

28:20.786 --> 28:24.050
my client likes Carmen.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.486
Well, that's good to know.

28:25.529 --> 28:28.924
Carmen a valued
first-year associate.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.883
It's one of the reasons...

28:30.926 --> 28:33.276
No, strike that,
it's the only reason

28:33.320 --> 28:35.409
that he's staying
with this firm.

28:35.452 --> 28:38.368
And so if Carmen tells you

28:38.412 --> 28:42.111
that she can't share with you
a piece of information,

28:42.155 --> 28:45.636
then she can't share
with you a piece of information.

28:45.680 --> 28:49.379
No, Mr. Lester, that is
not at all how this works.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.641
I'd better step out.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.600
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-No. No. Stay.

28:52.643 --> 28:55.081
Now, I am a name partner.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.953
Carmen is
a first-year associate.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.825
She's only been out of
law school for how long?

28:59.868 --> 29:01.130
How many months?

29:01.174 --> 29:03.654
-Eight.
-Eight months.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.352
Now, Carmen is free to resign,

29:05.395 --> 29:07.223
and hang her shingle
wherever she'd like.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.921
She can even go
and work for you.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.618
That is up to her.

29:10.661 --> 29:13.186
But while she is here,
she is subject to the rules

29:13.229 --> 29:14.883
and the mentoring of this firm.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.799
Carmen,
why don't you and I talk?

29:17.843 --> 29:19.192
No.

29:19.235 --> 29:22.064
We need to know now
if Carmen is staying,

29:22.108 --> 29:23.936
not after you two talk.

29:23.979 --> 29:26.373
If she leaves right now,

29:26.416 --> 29:29.158
we will look
for another associate.

29:29.942 --> 29:32.727
But you have a lot to learn,
Carmen,

29:32.771 --> 29:35.121
and you can only do that here.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.036
Well, that's what worries me.

29:37.079 --> 29:40.082
There are some
explosions of talent

29:40.126 --> 29:43.477
that are best left untaught.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.915
Well, I disagree with you,
but this is up to Carmen.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.178
Carmen?

29:53.704 --> 29:56.185
Mr. Lester, I'm...

29:57.491 --> 29:58.884
I'm staying here.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.194
Well, I'll talk to my client.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.850
Oh.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.809
You asked if something happened.

30:10.852 --> 30:14.508
Uh, it will happen
in ten minutes.

30:14.551 --> 30:18.251
Your husband, uh, will be served
with a grand jury summons.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.517
Kurt, call me.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.954
In about ten minutes, you're
probably going to be served

30:25.998 --> 30:28.130
with a grand jury summons.

30:28.174 --> 30:32.395
Don't worry, it is just
a power play by this AUSA.

30:32.439 --> 30:33.919
So, we'll just...

30:38.967 --> 30:40.751
Kurt...

30:40.795 --> 30:42.666
I'll have to call you back.

30:42.710 --> 30:44.538
I've just been served.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.372
Each of you has been given
a paddle.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.983
One side is red,
the other green.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.419
As we go through the material,

30:56.463 --> 30:57.986
I want you to hold up
the red side

30:58.030 --> 30:59.466
if you find the joke offensive,

30:59.509 --> 31:01.555
green for funny.

31:05.037 --> 31:07.169
"What is it
with Amish having such

31:07.213 --> 31:09.955
"big, juicy butts?

31:10.912 --> 31:13.045
Must be all those buggy rides."

31:14.742 --> 31:16.135
Buggy rides.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.397
Come on, anybody.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.008
Uh, red, offensive;
green, funny.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.575
What if it's neither?

31:21.618 --> 31:24.273
Can we see the original joke
before it was sensitized?

31:30.105 --> 31:32.194
-Now, that's funny.
-And offensive.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.370
But the whole point
is to be subversive, right?

31:34.414 --> 31:36.938
And we're going to piss off the
client if we turn it into shit.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.113
-Yeah.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.201
-That's our job.
-Hey, hey, hey.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.595
I've seen this woman in clubs,

31:41.638 --> 31:43.031
and I'm not offended.

31:43.075 --> 31:45.033
And last I checked, I'm Black.

31:45.077 --> 31:47.470
-He is Black.
-So, just let the woman
do her thing.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.124
-All right, has anybody filled
this guy in...
-Okay, but...

31:49.168 --> 31:50.952
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
We're getting off track.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.085
-Okay.
You young people

31:53.128 --> 31:55.130
know more about this than we do.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.392
So, we need your help.

31:56.436 --> 31:58.568
What's safe
for her to joke about?

31:58.612 --> 32:02.094
You want to make people laugh,
you joke about sex.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.530
Okay? That's what I do.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.401
-Yeah, and it's offensive.
-And anti-woman.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.882
But you can't tell a joke
without offending someone.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.231
That's not true.

32:09.275 --> 32:12.147
W.S. Gilbert still delights,

32:12.191 --> 32:14.280
over a hundred years later,
with delicious wordplay.

32:14.323 --> 32:15.977
Except Gilbert & Sullivan

32:16.021 --> 32:17.674
is classist and colonialist
bullshit.

32:17.718 --> 32:18.719
Fine.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.721
Then how about dumb blondes?

32:20.764 --> 32:22.070
-Hey.
-Take it back.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.474
♪ <i>Got a hold on me...</i>♪

32:34.517 --> 32:36.519
-So like, so like...

32:36.563 --> 32:38.826
-...like, fall apart,
and I was like...
-Mm. Okay. Wow.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.785
Where are the dancing girls
and slot machines?

32:41.829 --> 32:43.048
Hey...

32:43.091 --> 32:44.963
-Hey, want a drink?
-Am I Marissa?

32:45.006 --> 32:46.442
-Hey.
-Mm. Yeah.
-Thank you.

32:46.486 --> 32:47.966
-So what's so funny?

32:48.009 --> 32:51.665
Uh, just how the partners'
ideas on comedy lack...

32:51.708 --> 32:53.580
-Actual humor?
-Yeah, and grit and grime.

32:53.623 --> 32:56.452
You know, I like my comedy
like I like my women.

32:56.496 --> 32:57.932
-Dirty?
No.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.586
Sharp, and-and mean.

32:59.629 --> 33:02.154
Hey, you know, when we were kids
we used to cut each other up.

33:02.197 --> 33:05.026
At my school, we used to crack
on each other about everything.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.463
If you had a limp
or a speech impediment.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.335
Or your hair was too nappy
or too straight.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.468
Uh, if you were fat
or looked starved.

33:12.512 --> 33:14.166
-Uh... Are you serious?
-Oh...

33:15.167 --> 33:18.822
-We peed in
a girl's shampoo bottle.
-No, that crosses the line.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.651
And now it's like you need a
permission slip to tell a joke.

33:21.695 --> 33:24.306
Yeah, and that's why
I printed up these.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.526
Boom.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.963
Oh, my God, a permit to tell
a joke. I love it.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.312
Hey, you can have that one.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.010
Uh, I don't think
I should make a Black joke.

33:32.053 --> 33:33.141
Well, I can handle it.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.056
-Can I get a Jewish one?

33:35.100 --> 33:36.753
Here.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.930
-Jay, you want one?
-Shit, I want more than one.
Come on.

33:39.974 --> 33:42.368
So, what? You're just going
to hand these around?

33:42.411 --> 33:43.978
Yeah, like trading cards
or Bitcoin.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.153
What else you got?

33:45.197 --> 33:47.155
Um, feminists.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.157
Uh, Obama, Kamala.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.333
-Mmm...
-Uh, Republicans.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.596
-The Fats.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.338
-Ooh, skinny bitches,
that's a good one.
-Yeah. Yeah.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.079
Is there anything we can't do?

33:58.123 --> 34:00.342
Uh. Necrophilia?

34:00.386 --> 34:01.996
Mm. No. That could be funny.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.519
Autism.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.826
-Selena Gomez's
kidney transplant.
-Hey.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.828
-Put one in just to throw
everybody off.
-All right.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.830
One that's so inappropriate
even you wouldn't joke about it.

34:09.873 --> 34:12.180
Wait. Do you think we could
get cancelled for even joking

34:12.224 --> 34:13.486
-about being cancelled?
-Oh, yeah.

34:13.529 --> 34:16.141
All right, wait.
Here it comes now.

34:16.184 --> 34:19.883
Try this one and see.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.972
-Mm. No, no, no, no, no.
-Mm. No.

34:22.016 --> 34:23.583
-Come on. Come on.
-No. No. I'm not touching that.

34:23.626 --> 34:25.715
-No, no. Come on.
Oh, God. Okay.

34:25.759 --> 34:28.718
-Greta Thunberg
walks into a bar...
-And...

34:28.762 --> 34:30.198
-No. I can't do it.
-Ah, come on now.

34:30.242 --> 34:31.591
-Uh, she's a child.
-No, she's not.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.593
-She's 18.
-You're heart's not even in it.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.294
Do you think I'm funny?

34:41.818 --> 34:43.385
During sex?

34:43.429 --> 34:44.691
No.

34:44.734 --> 34:47.259
Did I look at you
like you were funny?

34:47.302 --> 34:50.740
Well, then that's my bad
'cause I was making my...

34:50.784 --> 34:53.656
"Damn, baby. You fine.
Get over here" face.

34:55.745 --> 34:57.312
No.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.880
No. Shut up. No. No.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.751
I was...

35:01.795 --> 35:05.103
No. I was, I was told today
that I'm not funny.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.583
Really? By who?

35:07.627 --> 35:09.977
Because, because you're funny.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.371
All right,
you just said that in a way

35:12.414 --> 35:14.677
that makes it sound
like I'm not funny.

35:14.721 --> 35:15.809
Wow.

35:15.852 --> 35:18.899
That's a lot to read
from just tone.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.248
You see,

35:20.292 --> 35:22.555
this is a discussion
nobody's going to win.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.078
Oh, God.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.427
You don't think I'm funny.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.821
No, uh. Okay, baby. Look.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.041
Funny people aren't funny.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.305
All right, you're going
to have to explain that.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.263
Okay.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.047
Funny people don't laugh.

35:37.091 --> 35:41.226
They just stare at you and, and
they say "Now, that's funny."

35:41.269 --> 35:43.445
They're not fun to be around.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.969
Oh, but you're, you're funny.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.449
Oh, you think I'm funny.

35:47.493 --> 35:50.322
See. That's why I love you.

35:52.324 --> 35:55.153
Okay.
Okay, wait. Wait.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.806
By love...
-No. No.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.678
-I meant...
-We don't, we don't have
to talk about it.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.941
No. Wait. Wait. Stop now. Look.

36:00.984 --> 36:04.292
By love, I meant affection.

36:04.336 --> 36:08.731
I have affection towards you.

36:10.211 --> 36:12.605
Then maybe we should
get married.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.827
Ah. Okay.

36:17.871 --> 36:18.959
Okay. Okay.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.482
-Now, now that's funny.
-Thank you.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.223
-All right. Yeah.
-Thank you. I am funny.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.791
-You just... I can hear
the applause now.
-That's right.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.706
Kurt, listen to me.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.490
You can be jailed for contempt.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.231
I'm not naming names.
I'll just take the Fifth.

36:30.275 --> 36:33.452
But you need a good-faith reason
to invoke the Fifth Amendment.

36:33.495 --> 36:34.844
If you don't have one--

36:34.888 --> 36:36.672
and God knows,
I hope that you don't--

36:36.716 --> 36:38.848
you can still be held
in contempt.

36:39.849 --> 36:41.808
Who decides if I have
a good-faith reason?

36:41.851 --> 36:43.244
A judge.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.507
Kurt, you're a witness
in a grand jury proceeding,

36:45.551 --> 36:47.553
not a gunslinger
at the O.K. Corral.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.555
Toughness is not what counts here.

36:49.598 --> 36:52.819
Mr. And Mrs. McVeigh. Hello.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.473
Are you ready?

36:54.516 --> 36:56.257
-Kurt?
-I'm ready.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.868
Oh, not you, uh, Diane.

36:58.912 --> 37:01.262
Oh. I'm first?

37:01.306 --> 37:02.916
Yes.

37:06.485 --> 37:09.792
I do go shooting
with my husband occasionally,

37:09.836 --> 37:13.492
but I wasn't with him
when he allegedly trained

37:13.535 --> 37:16.277
some of these men,
so I can't identify them.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.498
Are you sure about that,
Ms. Lockhart?

37:19.541 --> 37:22.544
I am sure of that, Ms. Crozier.

37:23.371 --> 37:24.894
Can I play you a tape recording?

37:24.938 --> 37:26.418
No.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.550
That was a joke.

37:28.594 --> 37:30.117
This is your grand jury.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.901
You can play anything you want.

37:31.945 --> 37:34.339
<i>Uh. Hello, yes.</i>

37:34.382 --> 37:36.036
<i>I would like to report the name</i>

37:36.079 --> 37:39.082
<i>of one of
the January 6 rioters</i>

37:39.126 --> 37:40.823
I saw on your poster.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.870
<i>Dylan Pike.</i>

37:45.785 --> 37:47.308
Isn't that your voice,

37:47.352 --> 37:49.919
identifying one of the men
that your husband trained?

37:49.963 --> 37:52.444
-It is my voice, but...
-So...

37:52.487 --> 37:55.795
you do, in fact, know a name.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.927
I didn't get that name
from Kurt.

37:57.971 --> 38:00.582
I got that name
from our firm's investigator,

38:00.626 --> 38:02.715
and it's the only one I know.

38:02.758 --> 38:05.718
But a moment ago, you said
that you didn't know any...

38:11.245 --> 38:13.465
...any of the names.

38:14.335 --> 38:17.469
No, you asked me if I could
identify any of the men

38:17.512 --> 38:19.949
that my husband trained,
and I said I could not.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.168
And I still cannot.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.822
Okay.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.693
If that's how you
want to leave it.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.129
Well, this is your questioning.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.306
It's where you want to leave it.

38:35.835 --> 38:37.750
Kurt, listen.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.578
I need to explain something.

38:39.621 --> 38:40.883
-Mr. McVeigh? Are you ready?
Uh, please.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.407
Can you give us
just a minute?

38:42.450 --> 38:44.974
-We need Mr. McVeigh now.
-Just a minute.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.348
Did you get a--
a card on your desk?

39:10.391 --> 39:13.916
Yeah. Yeah, mine says, "Good for
one joke about little people."

39:13.960 --> 39:15.091
What about you?

39:15.135 --> 39:16.702
White girl clothes.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.530
Huh. Did you use it?

39:18.573 --> 39:20.053
What does that mean, use it?

39:20.096 --> 39:22.185
Well, I-- I don't know,
I think it means

39:22.229 --> 39:23.448
that you're supposed to use

39:23.491 --> 39:25.101
this card to tell one joke.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.800
Oh, I don't want to tell a joke
about white girl clothes.

39:27.843 --> 39:31.194
-All right. Well, then trade.
-Oh.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.806
Is this about people making fun
of the partners

39:33.849 --> 39:35.895
'cause they think
we're not funny?

39:37.679 --> 39:39.246
Well, I don't know.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.944
Maybe we need to look for
someone with a "partners" card.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.385
<i>I want your white feminist card.</i>

39:47.428 --> 39:49.517
I don't know if
I can trust you with it.

39:49.561 --> 39:51.214
Oh.
-This is like Park Place.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.434
I'll let you have my jokes
about Make-a-Wish kids.

39:53.478 --> 39:54.522
-I have ethnic accents.
-Ooh.

39:54.566 --> 39:56.002
I am really good
at doing accents.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.525
What is going on here?
Who did this?

39:57.569 --> 40:00.049
Who do you think? The mail room.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.660
All right, we're going to have
to get a handle on this

40:01.703 --> 40:03.313
before the streamers come back.

40:03.357 --> 40:06.012
Because this is not
sensitivity-read material.

40:06.055 --> 40:08.014
-Mm.

40:08.057 --> 40:10.103
Do the, uh, the African one.
The, uh...

40:12.148 --> 40:13.933
Eh, I don't know,
that's more Indian.

40:13.976 --> 40:15.413
-I don't know what that was.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.328
Shit.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.113
What?

40:20.156 --> 40:22.115
HR wants to see me.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.033
Me, too.

40:29.949 --> 40:32.255
Oh, okay...

40:34.344 --> 40:36.172
Uh...

40:37.652 --> 40:39.567
The fun's over.
Someone talked to HR.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.090
-It's cool, it's cool.
-No, no, no, no. No.

40:41.134 --> 40:43.876
All right. No.
Here's what we do.

40:43.919 --> 40:45.051
Nothing.

40:45.094 --> 40:46.400
We all refuse to go.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.488
They can't fire all of us.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.316
Actually, they probably can.

40:49.359 --> 40:50.883
So we delay.

40:50.926 --> 40:53.625
Everyone says they're busy,
which we all are,

40:53.668 --> 40:55.496
and they'll stop by...

40:55.540 --> 40:56.932
next month.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.673
-That's-that's not a bad idea.

40:58.717 --> 41:00.458
Yeah, no, I-I think it is.

41:05.158 --> 41:06.899
Oh, come on.

41:06.942 --> 41:08.596
-Your next witness, buddy.
-Yes, Your Honor.

41:08.640 --> 41:09.902
I'd like to call the inventor

41:09.945 --> 41:12.121
of the NFT artwork, Mr. Earle.

41:12.165 --> 41:15.298
I want to be clear
to the members of the jury

41:15.342 --> 41:17.300
that all witnesses will be
fully costumed.

41:17.344 --> 41:21.870
So you have no idea
of race or class status.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.439
Oop, easy does it.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.832
Dean, help him up.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.312
Oh, no, wrong way.
You're getting cold.

41:29.356 --> 41:30.966
There you go.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.490
Welcome.

41:32.533 --> 41:33.621
Don't sit on your stinger. Easy.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.971
So, Mr. Earle,

41:36.015 --> 41:40.628
very simply, can you tell us
what an NFT artwork is?

41:40.672 --> 41:42.325
It's a unique piece of art,

41:42.369 --> 41:46.025
made up of a blockchain
that establishes its uniqueness.

41:46.068 --> 41:49.071
The blockchain tech
behind NFTs

41:49.115 --> 41:51.813
allows us a means
of authentication.

41:51.857 --> 41:54.207
Allows proof of ownership

41:54.250 --> 41:56.731
to be assigned
to digital art works

41:56.775 --> 41:58.341
which makes collectibles
one of a kind.

41:58.385 --> 42:00.343
Mr. Cord, hi.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.345
Ah. Hi.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.478
You're Eli Gold's little girl.

42:04.522 --> 42:06.524
-His daughter.
-Yeah.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.526
I saw you last at my work.

42:08.569 --> 42:10.266
That's right, yeah. Come on.

42:10.310 --> 42:11.920
Join me.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.012
This is a thing, isn't it?

42:17.056 --> 42:18.666
Um... Yeah.

42:18.710 --> 42:20.363
How do you know about it?

42:20.407 --> 42:24.019
Well, I met the judge, uh,
where you work, on the elevator.

42:24.063 --> 42:26.587
Sounded interesting,
his little project.

42:26.631 --> 42:28.154
Your Honor, this is prejudicial.

42:28.197 --> 42:29.416
I actually agree.

42:29.459 --> 42:31.897
And I will instruct the jury
to disregard.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.463
But my guess is he...

42:33.507 --> 42:37.729
won't mind, because juries
can't disregard something

42:37.772 --> 42:39.208
they've already heard.

42:39.252 --> 42:42.168
So, before we started,
I required both lawyers

42:42.211 --> 42:45.388
to give me photos of themselves
in nothing but a diaper

42:45.432 --> 42:46.825
and sucking their thumbs.

42:46.868 --> 42:49.175
-Your Honor, I didn't intend...
-Yes, you did.

42:49.218 --> 42:50.611
So...

42:50.655 --> 42:53.571
Please disregard this photo
you are about to see.

42:56.878 --> 43:00.099
I think you are the next <i>
GQ</i> cover, my friend.

43:00.839 --> 43:02.536
So you're financing this?

43:02.580 --> 43:05.017
Oh, don't look so happy,
Mr. Defense Lawyer...

43:05.060 --> 43:06.409
How much?

43:06.453 --> 43:08.498
Start-up money, five million.

43:10.631 --> 43:13.503
Why are you interested?

43:13.547 --> 43:16.898
Well... this is the future.

43:16.942 --> 43:19.118
We're disrupting things,
you see?

43:19.161 --> 43:22.643
Commerce and travel,
communications,

43:22.687 --> 43:25.864
currency--
now justice.

43:25.907 --> 43:27.866
The key isn't the money.

43:27.909 --> 43:30.695
The key is I'm bringing cases.

43:30.738 --> 43:33.567
To the back room
of a copy store?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.308
Oh.

43:35.351 --> 43:36.918
Have you ever seen

43:36.962 --> 43:39.094
the garage where they founded
Hewlett-Packard?

43:39.138 --> 43:41.619
<i>It's about a fifth the size
of this room,</i>

43:41.662 --> 43:43.316
and it's a museum now.

43:43.359 --> 43:45.274
It's our hallowed ground.

43:45.318 --> 43:47.886
20 years from now,
this will be a museum.

43:47.929 --> 43:49.452
It will be a shrine, to...

43:49.496 --> 43:50.889
-to Justice.
You are dismissed.

43:50.932 --> 43:52.891
-Your witness.
-Oh...

43:52.934 --> 43:55.154
Here comes the defendant.

43:56.982 --> 43:58.940
You remind me of an old joke.

43:58.984 --> 44:01.290
Guy walks into a Florida bar
with his alligator,

44:01.334 --> 44:03.771
says to the bartender,
"You serve lawyers here?"

44:03.815 --> 44:06.948
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh,
for responding to our summons.

44:06.992 --> 44:08.733
You're welcome.

44:08.776 --> 44:10.691
McVeigh. That's...

44:10.735 --> 44:12.824
That's an unfortunate name.

44:12.867 --> 44:14.913
Any relation?

44:16.218 --> 44:17.785
I've been told, by my lawyer,

44:17.829 --> 44:19.308
to respond
to all your questions,

44:19.352 --> 44:20.745
"I refuse to answer
on the grounds

44:20.788 --> 44:22.311
that it may tend
to incriminate me."

44:22.355 --> 44:25.488
Really? Asking if you're
related to the Oklahoma bomber?

44:25.532 --> 44:26.968
That might incriminate you?

44:27.012 --> 44:28.709
I've been told, by my lawyer,

44:28.753 --> 44:30.363
to respond
to all your questions,

44:30.406 --> 44:32.147
-"I refuse to answer
on the grounds that it...
-Okay.

44:32.191 --> 44:33.801
...may tend to incriminate me."

44:33.845 --> 44:36.499
Let's turn to January 6
of this year.

44:36.543 --> 44:39.415
All we want to know are the
names of the gunmen you trained.

44:39.459 --> 44:41.026
Do you know those names?

44:41.069 --> 44:42.723
I've been told, by my lawyer,

44:42.767 --> 44:44.116
to respond
to all your questions,

44:44.159 --> 44:45.770
"I refuse to answer
on the ground

44:45.813 --> 44:47.336
-that it may tend
to incriminate me."
-Mr. McVeigh.

44:47.380 --> 44:49.861
You have to have
a good-faith reason

44:49.904 --> 44:51.558
to invoke the Fifth Amendment.

44:51.601 --> 44:54.517
You can't just use it
to avoid answering questions.

44:54.561 --> 44:58.521
Because I can hold you in
contempt for refusing to answer.

44:58.565 --> 45:00.262
Is that a question?

45:00.306 --> 45:01.960
Yes.

45:03.396 --> 45:05.441
I've been told by my lawyer to
respond to all your questions,

45:05.485 --> 45:07.530
-"I refuse to answer
on the grounds

45:07.574 --> 45:08.967
-that it may tend
to incriminate me."
-Let's talk about your lawyer.

45:09.010 --> 45:12.187
Because, uh, you know...

45:12.231 --> 45:15.364
I don't know that she has
your best interests at heart.

45:15.408 --> 45:17.236
Let me play you a tape.

45:18.063 --> 45:20.021
<i>Uh, hello. Yes.</i>

45:20.065 --> 45:22.197
<i>I would like to report the name</i>

45:22.241 --> 45:25.026
<i>of one of the January 6 rioters</i>

45:25.070 --> 45:27.072
<i>I saw on your poster.</i>

45:29.291 --> 45:30.945
<i>Dylan Pike.</i>

45:31.772 --> 45:33.034
<i>No.</i>

45:33.078 --> 45:35.036
<i>Uh, I'd rather not
leave my name.</i>

45:37.430 --> 45:39.911
The only reason that you're here

45:39.954 --> 45:42.217
is because your wife
is a talker.

45:42.261 --> 45:44.306
Would you like
to comment on that?

45:50.791 --> 45:52.750
I've been told by my lawyer...

45:56.101 --> 45:58.059
Oh.

45:58.103 --> 46:00.192
I should have told you.

46:00.235 --> 46:01.454
I'm sorry.

46:01.497 --> 46:04.457
But I knew you'd be upset,
so I withheld.

46:05.501 --> 46:07.590
I was wrong.

46:07.634 --> 46:10.071
So... so what happened?

46:10.115 --> 46:11.681
Did you take the Fifth?

46:11.725 --> 46:13.683
Did she allow it?

46:13.727 --> 46:15.555
Kurt.

46:15.598 --> 46:17.252
I need a new lawyer.

46:35.575 --> 46:37.795
Okay. We need to ask everybody
to cool it,

46:37.838 --> 46:39.318
because we're all getting calls
from HR.

46:39.361 --> 46:41.363
I didn't even make a joke,
and I'm being called.

46:41.407 --> 46:43.452
All right, so we'll just
collect the cards

46:43.496 --> 46:45.498
and we'll just...
we'll go back to normal.

46:45.541 --> 46:46.804
They were harmless.

46:46.847 --> 46:48.370
HR needs to stop harassing us.

46:48.414 --> 46:50.808
Everyone got along.
No one got into a fight.

46:50.851 --> 46:52.679
Everybody got that it
was a joke.

46:52.722 --> 46:54.637
I'm not going up to see them.

46:54.681 --> 46:55.987
Well, we can't boycott HR.

46:56.030 --> 46:57.989
-Why not? Downstairs is.
-Because we're adults.

46:58.032 --> 47:01.209
As partners, we work with HR,
not against them.

47:01.253 --> 47:03.124
So nobody here
is joining any boycott.

47:03.168 --> 47:07.346
So we have to go up and be
questioned and sensitized again?

47:07.389 --> 47:08.956
Oh. All right. All right.
All right. Fine.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.175
I will-- I will go up first
and talk to them.

47:10.218 --> 47:12.046
Oh. Oh. Look who's here.

47:12.090 --> 47:15.658
Okay. I will, um,
walk them through our work.

47:15.702 --> 47:17.182
Okay...

47:21.229 --> 47:23.666
I am sorry I missed you
the other day, Mr. Wackner.

47:23.710 --> 47:25.016
It couldn't be avoided.

47:25.059 --> 47:26.321
Oh, it was no problem.

47:26.365 --> 47:28.976
I found it
incredibly educational.

47:29.020 --> 47:31.587
Yes. Marissa says
that you have been busy.

47:31.631 --> 47:35.156
She also says you have
great plans for your court.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.897
Well, if you call it "great'
that I finally

47:36.941 --> 47:38.899
got a plumber to fix my toilet.

47:38.943 --> 47:40.509
I put in one of those
Japanese toilets.

47:40.553 --> 47:42.511
Have you used one of those?
The seat's always warm.

47:42.555 --> 47:46.080
I-I would call great, uh,
a $5 million investment.

47:46.124 --> 47:48.909
Actually, I met Hal right here.

47:48.953 --> 47:51.825
So, we have you to thank for
bringing us together, Diane.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.522
I'm going to double his retainer

47:53.566 --> 47:57.004
so that you can give
your full attention

47:57.048 --> 47:58.963
to the 9 3/4 Circuit.

47:59.006 --> 48:01.400
The kind of attention
it really deserves.

48:03.228 --> 48:04.490
Would you like my advice?

48:04.533 --> 48:06.013
Yes.

48:06.057 --> 48:09.190
You can't be judging cases
thrown at you by David Cord

48:09.234 --> 48:11.149
if David Cord is
financing your court.

48:11.192 --> 48:12.890
That is corruption.

48:12.933 --> 48:17.024
I have absolutely no vested
interest in any of these cases.

48:17.068 --> 48:18.547
-None.
-Well, how is that possible?

48:18.591 --> 48:21.942
I'm stepping away
from my businesses.

48:21.986 --> 48:23.552
I want to work on this country.

48:23.596 --> 48:26.512
I want to...
I want to bring it back.

48:26.555 --> 48:28.209
I'm retiring.

48:28.253 --> 48:30.385
I know my promise won't do
much good here.

48:30.429 --> 48:33.475
But, uh, I don't care if Jesus
himself financed my court.

48:33.519 --> 48:36.217
I'd cash his checks
and judge against him.

48:36.261 --> 48:39.829
I am the most untouchable man
on Earth.

48:39.873 --> 48:41.353
You know why?

48:41.396 --> 48:43.268
"I got nothing to lose,

48:43.311 --> 48:45.096
-and nothing to gain."
-Mm.

48:45.139 --> 48:46.749
That's a Todd Snider song.

48:46.793 --> 48:49.883
♪ <i>I got nothing to lose,
nothing to gain♪</i>

48:49.927 --> 48:53.887
♪ <i>It's like a one way ticket
to cruise in the passing lane♪</i>

48:53.931 --> 48:57.195
♪ <i>I cannot complain.</i>♪

49:01.895 --> 49:03.941
Okay, gentlemen.

49:04.811 --> 49:07.118
What advice do you need?

49:07.988 --> 49:09.294
As you can see,

49:09.337 --> 49:11.992
we offered alternate lines,
when appropriate.

49:12.036 --> 49:14.560
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

49:14.603 --> 49:17.911
-This is, uh,
very thorough work.
Thank you.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.347
I won't say it was easy.

49:19.391 --> 49:21.219
Well, you know what they say,
comedy is hard.

49:21.262 --> 49:23.612
-Right, Morgan?
-Not done yet.

49:27.007 --> 49:28.617
Yeah, we, well, we...

49:28.661 --> 49:32.056
-really liked
the original pages...
-Uh, just...

49:32.099 --> 49:33.405
Just so you know,

49:33.448 --> 49:35.581
uh, we have other services too.

49:35.624 --> 49:39.150
Our litigation department is
one of the best in the country.

49:43.154 --> 49:44.459
You don't like it?

49:45.852 --> 49:47.985
Um. No, I, I...

49:48.028 --> 49:50.030
I... I love it.

49:50.074 --> 49:51.292
I...
I love it.

49:51.336 --> 49:54.165
This is, uh...

49:54.208 --> 49:55.644
This is the funniest thing
I've read in years.

49:55.688 --> 49:57.385
It's the funniest thing
from a lawyer since...

49:57.429 --> 49:59.692
since Dershowitz
stripped down for a massage.

50:01.172 --> 50:02.825
We can take another look at it.

50:02.869 --> 50:05.872
Morgan, we don't want
to get cancelled. Okay?

50:05.915 --> 50:07.308
You're right. You're right.

50:07.352 --> 50:08.962
You're right.
You're right to be worried.

50:09.006 --> 50:13.488
In fact, I will give you a list
of Twitter cancellers

50:13.532 --> 50:16.143
that you can put on stage
when I get cancelled.

50:16.187 --> 50:17.623
I'm sure they're just as funny.

50:17.666 --> 50:19.755
Maybe not as funny as...

50:19.799 --> 50:21.714
this, but...

50:21.757 --> 50:23.063
This is going to be
hard to beat.

50:23.107 --> 50:24.282
I mean, if you read what I read?

50:24.325 --> 50:26.153
Do we have the same copy,
because...

50:26.197 --> 50:27.546
Eieesh, you guys.

50:27.589 --> 50:28.982
Funny...

50:29.026 --> 50:30.984
I know comedy and this is...

50:31.028 --> 50:32.899
Aw! You're too good.

50:32.942 --> 50:34.292
I get it. I get it.

50:34.335 --> 50:35.771
This, though... Wait a minute.

50:35.815 --> 50:37.208
Norwegians.
Did you see that part?

50:37.251 --> 50:39.732
Get out with the Norwegians!

50:39.775 --> 50:40.907
Who...

50:40.950 --> 50:42.126
came up with the Norwegians?

50:42.169 --> 50:43.823
You? Maybe you.

50:43.866 --> 50:46.695
You guys are all going to be
big on TikTok. I have a feeling.

50:46.739 --> 50:50.308
Because anybody that says
"Norwegians" as a punchline

50:50.351 --> 50:52.049
is too good.

50:52.092 --> 50:54.312
It's too good. It's so good, in
fact, I'm quitting the business.

50:54.355 --> 50:56.096
-Finally, someone is just...
-Well...

50:56.140 --> 50:58.925
-is just sticking it
to the Norwegians.
-This was helpful.

50:58.968 --> 51:02.059
Screw 'em!
-Our firm can handle
all your needs.

51:02.102 --> 51:04.409
You've peaked
in comedy.
-I'll be in touch.

51:04.452 --> 51:06.063
I'm out.
-Ms. Reddick...

51:06.106 --> 51:08.717
-Mr. Cooper.
-I'm quittin' the business,
congratulations.

51:08.761 --> 51:11.024
Woof! Yes!

51:11.068 --> 51:13.113
Makes me laugh.

51:13.157 --> 51:15.376
I'm quitting the business...

51:15.420 --> 51:17.770
-Well, that was fucked.

51:18.727 --> 51:21.121
David, they asked us
for a sensitivity read,

51:21.165 --> 51:22.862
not to redefine comedy.

51:22.905 --> 51:26.866
No, they asked us
to sign a client, you and I.

51:26.909 --> 51:30.696
A massive client, and we failed.

51:31.827 --> 51:33.438
You failed.

51:33.481 --> 51:35.266
You know what, David?
Why don't you just take

51:35.309 --> 51:37.268
your hard-nosed asshole tactics
back upstairs.

51:37.311 --> 51:39.096
-I'm your boss, Liz.
No.

51:39.139 --> 51:41.054
My boss is your boss,

51:41.098 --> 51:42.708
and he is somewhere in Dubai.

51:42.751 --> 51:44.623
And you and I don't even
know his name.

51:44.666 --> 51:47.800
So stop the shit
and work with me.

51:47.843 --> 51:50.498
I'll talk to Del later.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.114
That was nicely done.

51:57.157 --> 51:59.986
Very Boseman-like.

52:00.029 --> 52:01.292
I know.

52:08.342 --> 52:10.344
Hey. I recognize you.

52:10.388 --> 52:12.564
How do I recognize you?

52:12.607 --> 52:16.481
Uh... Chicago Improv. 2008.

52:17.482 --> 52:19.962
-Yeah. You were great.
-Oh, thanks, man.

52:20.006 --> 52:21.573
-Hal Wackner. David Cord.

52:21.616 --> 52:23.966
-Hi.
-Del Cooper. Oh, thanks.

52:24.010 --> 52:25.272
What do you do now, Del?

52:25.316 --> 52:27.100
I, uh, own a comedy
streaming service.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.058
-You?
-I invented a court.

52:29.102 --> 52:31.191
-Ah.
-Um, I finance it.

52:31.235 --> 52:33.193
Now, that's a funny idea.

52:33.237 --> 52:35.369

Did you talk to Dylan Pike?

52:50.036 --> 52:51.820
I did. Just today.

52:51.864 --> 52:55.476
And he's saying
that Kurt is the ringleader?

52:55.520 --> 52:57.522
Yep.

52:58.871 --> 53:00.351
Well, what else?

53:01.482 --> 53:03.441
Diane, you're not his...

53:03.484 --> 53:05.704
Kurt said you're not
his lawyer anymore.

53:05.747 --> 53:08.359
-Well, yes, but...
-Julius is his lawyer.

53:08.402 --> 53:10.230
You need me?

53:10.274 --> 53:12.232
Yes. The Kurt McVeigh case.

Thank you for your concern
up here in Human Resources.

53:41.566 --> 53:45.178
We appreciate it,
but I-I just want to insist,

53:45.222 --> 53:46.832
all right, this-this was just

53:46.875 --> 53:49.356
a bunch of lawyers
blowing off steam

53:49.400 --> 53:52.881
and satirizing
the sensitivity of...

53:52.925 --> 53:56.624
the justifiable sensitivity
of corporate culture.

53:56.668 --> 53:59.714
Nobody complained
about being the butt of a joke

53:59.758 --> 54:03.022
because, as you can see,
everyone was the butt of a joke.

54:03.065 --> 54:04.719
Because everybody had a card.

54:04.763 --> 54:07.244
Everybody was being made fun of.

54:07.287 --> 54:09.681
Look, look, there's even a card
with my name on it

54:09.724 --> 54:11.944
that someone from the mail room
used to tell a joke

54:11.987 --> 54:15.295
about how far
a stick was up my ass.

54:16.427 --> 54:17.950
Who from the mail room?

54:19.734 --> 54:20.648
No.

54:20.692 --> 54:21.910
We-we just want to talk to him.

54:21.954 --> 54:23.956
No. No.
I was the butt of that joke,

54:23.999 --> 54:26.524
and then I got to say a joke
about them.

54:26.567 --> 54:28.482
So, no.
You're not going to review this.

54:28.526 --> 54:29.918
We can go upstairs.

54:29.962 --> 54:31.920
-There is no upstairs.
-There's always upstairs.

54:31.964 --> 54:35.359
Okay, um... You know what?
Uh... let's see.

54:35.402 --> 54:37.012
Here you go.

54:38.971 --> 54:42.714
All right. You have a card
that says, "Black boss."

54:42.757 --> 54:45.847
I'm Black, and I'm a boss.

54:45.891 --> 54:47.066
So, go ahead.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.243
-Okay. Hold on. Here we go.

54:51.070 --> 54:52.811
I have on that says,
"Human Resources."

54:52.854 --> 54:54.769
So, I get to tell a joke
about you,

54:54.813 --> 54:57.468
and then you get
to tell a joke about me.

54:59.121 --> 55:00.949
Why would I do that?

55:00.993 --> 55:03.300
Because we're human.

55:06.346 --> 55:08.435
Okay. Here I go.

55:08.479 --> 55:10.959
How many Human Resources people
does it take

55:11.003 --> 55:12.700
to screw in a lightbulb?
