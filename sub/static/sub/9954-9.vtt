—Wade!

00:12.555 --> 00:14.170
JENNIFER: Oh, my God.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.716
Did a man named Agent Howard
help you get here?

00:18.853 --> 00:22.016
No, actually the guy's name
was William.

00:22.148 --> 00:23.308
Lexie.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.641
Lexie?
Pretty name.

00:29.906 --> 00:31.112
WILLIAM:
That guy was here because of me.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.151
He was afraid
I was gonna tell you something.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.990
—Let's go.
—Like what?

00:35.119 --> 00:36.859
You're someone else entirely.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.452
[Grunts]

00:38.581 --> 00:40.742
And unless you let me
help you find out who you are,

00:40.875 --> 00:42.866
a lot of people are gonna die.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.664
The pain of everyone in this town,
it's on us.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.251
I love you.

[Gunfire]

01:09.737 --> 01:10.943
What happened?
What'd you see?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.812
—That was him.
—Who?

01:12.949 --> 01:14.985
He was in the barn.
That can't be ——

01:15.117 --> 01:16.197
[Door opens]

01:16.327 --> 01:17.442
Hey!

01:19.121 --> 01:20.497
I heard gunshots.
What happened?

01:20.623 --> 01:21.988
There was an intruder.
Audrey went after him.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.159
—Take the back.
—l'm on it.

01:23.292 --> 01:26.329
—Audrey went after him?
—Duke called her Audrey, too.

01:26.462 --> 01:27.793
She's Audrey.
I'll explain later.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.537
You'll explain now!

01:29.674 --> 01:31.665
Audrey was gonna shoot me.
That guy got in the way.

01:31.801 --> 01:33.666
When she gets back,
she will kill me.

01:33.803 --> 01:35.339
No!

01:35.471 --> 01:36.972
She won't.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.776
It was the same guy.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.190
Trust me.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.859
He's very distinctive.

01:55.992 --> 01:58.199
Another man came into the barn
with him.

02:01.414 --> 02:03.871
That's them.
How did you ——

02:04.000 --> 02:07.333
These are the two men
who abducted Carrie Benson,

02:07.461 --> 02:09.042
altered her trouble.

02:09.171 --> 02:12.254
I thought the people you knew
in the barn weren't real.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.714
Except the guy that helped you.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.925
William. He was real.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.759
So apparently these guys are, too.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.879
Yeah.
And now they're here.

02:20.016 --> 02:23.725
When we helped Audrey
escape the barn,

02:23.853 --> 02:28.643
we tore a hole in the soft spot
between worlds, let them out.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.480
They've been running amok in Haven,

02:30.609 --> 02:32.565
turning curses into contagion,

02:32.695 --> 02:34.606
afflicting the non—troubled.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.604
Which is why you need
to let Audrey and I finish.

02:36.741 --> 02:39.448
No!
Everything's different now.

02:39.577 --> 02:42.410
We found a local Mi'kmaq legend.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.575
It says that once the soft spot
is torn open,

02:45.708 --> 02:49.166
what was once our salvation
is now our doom.

02:49.295 --> 02:52.583
Audrey killing you now will only
bring destruction to Haven.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.751
That is if the horseshoe crabs
with human eyes,

02:54.884 --> 02:57.546
evil, and agony
don't get us first.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.335
It's a fun read.

02:59.472 --> 03:01.303
We have to get back
to the archives,

03:01.432 --> 03:03.514

the Mi'kmaq legend

03:05.728 --> 03:09.016
Your deception
may have saved us all.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.608
Who are you?
What do you want?

03:21.744 --> 03:24.952
My friend and l have lost something,
a certain box.

03:25.081 --> 03:27.197
It is very important to us.

03:27.333 --> 03:31.952
And you will help us find it.

03:32.088 --> 03:34.545
I don't think so.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.800
I'll bet we can convince you.

03:36.926 --> 03:37.961
I fought in the war.

03:38.094 --> 03:40.301
You might want to try
a different tactic than fear.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.294
What does make you afraid, Chief?

03:42.431 --> 03:43.807
The troubles?

03:43.933 --> 03:45.969
No. I already got one myself.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.936

my friend and I lost something.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.857
You lay a hand on me,
you better kill me.

05:18.444 --> 05:21.607
Go outside and cool down.

05:21.739 --> 05:24.151
We're not finished with him yet.

05:25.743 --> 05:28.530
Go. Now.

05:30.748 --> 05:32.409
You'd think by now
we'd have figured out

Hold on. I'll mute it.
Listen.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.800
It was a mistake
to piss him off.

Where's the big guy going?
Sight—seeing?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.796

He must be tough.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.271
Tougher than he looks.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.435
But I guess you already knew that

for the big rescue.

Why don't you tell me
about this box you're looking for?

Listen, since your plans
have gone up in smoke,

why don't you just tell me
what's in this box?

10:44.269 --> 10:47.602
My plan will be fine.
It just needs a minor tweak.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.022
Well, while you work on that,
why don't you tell me

[Chuckles]

11:01.370 --> 11:02.780
We could do that.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.029
But, if I were you,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.406
I'd be more worried about
all the other people in this town

your list of suspects.

who you really are

11:30.190 --> 11:31.566

They just kept asking me
about this box

11:35.529 --> 11:39.113
and where it was
and where I hid it and...

11:39.241 --> 11:42.904
Maybe I did, but I don't remember
anything about it.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.952
Well, after I drop
these fingerprints off,

11:46.081 --> 11:47.696
we'll take a crack at our guests.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.126
If I can get 'em to believe
that William

11:50.252 --> 11:53.164

maybe they'll tell us what's inside.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.458
There's something you need to know.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.210
Something?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.052
That's an understatement.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.810
The barn had a keeper,

12:13.942 --> 12:17.059
someone who took care of it.

12:17.195 --> 12:20.904
In a way he ——
he took care of me.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.614
But then he died.

12:23.285 --> 12:26.823
And I think that you were
supposed to replace him.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.287
But when the barn disappeared,

12:29.416 --> 12:32.203
it just wiped
your memory instead.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.044
The barn can do that?

12:36.173 --> 12:38.664
lt's wiped my memory
I don't know how many times.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.415
Oh.

12:40.552 --> 12:44.136
I know what it's like
to not remember,

12:44.264 --> 12:46.971
to not know who you are.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.142
These aren't the hands of a farmer.

12:52.314 --> 12:55.021
Yeah, it's not that kind of barn.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.186
Okay.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.692
This is all kind of terrifying.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.197
It is.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.190
But the real you
is in there somewhere.

13:04.326 --> 13:06.533
It's just waiting to come out.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.994
You taught me that.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.999
Jordan's still missing.

Where's the knife?

13:16.338 --> 13:19.045
Knife, knife, knife, knife.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.947

13:50.080 --> 13:52.913
I saw you bring in the two guys
who kidnapped Dwight,

13:53.041 --> 13:55.578
the ones from the barn.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.827
You want me to talk to them,
don't you?

14:00.257 --> 14:03.499
Look, l was thinking,

14:03.635 --> 14:06.251
with your connection to the barn...

14:06.388 --> 14:08.219
That I might be able
to get information out of them

14:08.348 --> 14:10.339
the others can't.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.762
They may know things.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.022
About the barn.
About Howard.

14:17.566 --> 14:18.931
Also about you.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.939
How you could hear inside the barn
in the first place.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.484
You're gonna be with me, right?

14:34.833 --> 14:37.040
The whole time.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.931
Do you know me?
Know who I am?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.345
How did you escape the barn?

14:55.270 --> 14:57.636
And any particular reason
you'd like to destroy

14:57.773 --> 15:00.765
a picturesque little town in Maine,
or are we just on your bucket list?

15:01.777 --> 15:03.859
And can you buy your clothes
off the rack, or is everything ——

15:04.988 --> 15:06.148
Hey, hey.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.194
You try that again
and I will end you.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.069
I don't care if we're
in a police station.

15:13.205 --> 15:14.945
[Laughs]

15:15.082 --> 15:16.413
You all right?

15:16.541 --> 15:19.658
He seems to care about you,
little one,

15:19.795 --> 15:23.538
but what is he really after?

15:28.470 --> 15:29.801
Let's get out of here.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.509
So that I can get you back
to the psych ward.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.389
It's okay.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.518
You're lying.
You do not have the box.

15:46.655 --> 15:50.694
If you did,
you would have opened it.

15:50.826 --> 15:52.362
What makes you think I haven't?

15:52.494 --> 15:56.203
'Cause the contents of the box,
once released,

15:56.331 --> 16:00.825
will devour you
and the ones you love.

16:02.796 --> 16:07.085
The first to be taken ——
Audrey Parker.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.588
You don't get to threaten Audrey.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.353
Why are you worried, Detective?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.902
Is it because your precious Audrey
is in danger,

16:33.034 --> 16:39.246
or is it because she's in danger
of falling in love with someone else?

16:40.041 --> 16:41.542
Like that guy she's with.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.831
William.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.625
[Door opens and shuts]

16:58.226 --> 16:59.682
It's gotta be here.
It's gotta be here.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.392
It's gotta be here.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.397
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.650
Where would he hide it?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.278
I'm sorry.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.746
He was weird and creepy,

17:21.875 --> 17:24.082
and we didn't even get anything
out of him.

17:26.338 --> 17:29.796
Audrey could have.
She's great at that.

17:29.925 --> 17:33.213
She's a cop.
No history of mental illness.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.462
That's one of the things
that makes her so totally hot.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.845
Oh, yeah, she's hot all right.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.140
What?

17:44.272 --> 17:46.137
Who's hot?

17:46.274 --> 17:47.650
Don't play games with me.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.892
We just slept together.
Why?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.528
Because we wanted to.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.148
Because ——

17:56.284 --> 17:58.661
Wait.
Okay, there's a right answer here.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.493
Because I care about you.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.328
Because I like you.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.822
Hang on.
What are we talking about?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.663
I mean, it's really you
that should be in one of these.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.331
You seduced me
for my supernatural connections.

18:13.969 --> 18:17.132
Wait, I'm the guy here, okay?

18:17.264 --> 18:19.175
I'm supposed to be the one
who gets close

18:19.307 --> 18:20.843
and then pushes you away
and freaks out.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.091
You're kind of throwing me off here.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.342
You did it to help Audrey.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.561
You would do anything
and exploit anyone to save Audrey.

18:26.690 --> 18:27.554
What are you ——
[Cell phone rings]

18:27.691 --> 18:28.680
Hang on.

18:28.817 --> 18:29.727
Yeah?

18:30.193 --> 18:31.023
[Sighs]
All right.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.017
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.770
Look, Dwight is tearing up
The Cape Rouge right now.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.647
I'm sorry, but I don't want
to leave you like this ——

18:37.784 --> 18:38.569
Just go, Duke.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.192
I don't even want
to look at you right now.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.991
No, you don't understand. I'm ——
Yup. Good talk.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.701
So once you find this box,

18:49.838 --> 18:52.705
what do you think's
gonna be in it?

18:53.675 --> 18:55.461
I'm guessing something pretty bad.

18:57.012 --> 19:01.722
If it's not outrageously bad,
could we get some food?

19:01.850 --> 19:03.386
Listen I'm told
that our vending machine

19:03.518 --> 19:05.850
has the best selection of snacks
in the county.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.220
—Really?
—Except for the Baby Ruths.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.392
The button's a little stuck,
so don't push P—3.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.061
Okay, good to know.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.400
Nathan.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.244
Oh, what's wrong?
Did he say something?

19:28.209 --> 19:31.337
I don't know what happened
between the two of you in that barn,

19:31.463 --> 19:32.669
but she is not Lexie anymore.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.458
—Stop, stop.
—No, I don't remember a barn.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.422
What, you figured that's
the best way to get close to her?

19:36.551 --> 19:37.916
—Make her feel sorry for you?
—Whoa, whoa.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.294
"Oh, poor me.
l have amnesia."

19:40.430 --> 19:42.762
He doesn't know what you're
talking about, and neither do |.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.427
—Okay? So just stay off of him.
—You never see it, do you?

19:44.559 --> 19:46.015
—What?
—Guys playing you.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.227
First it was Duke.
Now this William.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.771
How long
before you sleep with him?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.436
[Gasps]

19:55.028 --> 19:57.269
What's wrong with you?
Okay, you're ——

19:57.405 --> 19:59.441
—You're acting crazy.
—No, I'm not.

19:59.574 --> 20:02.236
I'm just willing to fight for us.
Are you?

20:05.705 --> 20:09.618
So, in the barn, did we ——

20:09.751 --> 20:13.243
No, no, we —— we didn't.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.839
Then that guy has
some serious jealousy issues.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.130
Nathan doesn't usually act like that.

20:22.514 --> 20:25.506
Something is very wrong.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.343
Coroner said she needs to see you.
It sounds important.

20:29.479 --> 20:30.969
Okay, can you just ——

20:31.106 --> 20:33.267
Can you let me know
if Nathan leaves the station?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.766
Sure.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.195
I think you better come with me.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.121
You son of a...

20:51.126 --> 20:52.411
What ——
Yeah, hold on.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.832
If I can just combine this blaster
with a diamond, I'm all clear.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.296
—You wanted to see me?
—Ugh, yeah.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.505
Eh, uh. You're rolling
with a new good—looking.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.342
Who are you?

21:03.471 --> 21:05.507
l'm William. Hi.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.050
—How you doing?
—Okay.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.720
—Where's Wuornos?
—He's busy.

21:09.853 --> 21:12.219
He's —— he's acting kind of strange.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.686
Well, so was this guy

21:13.815 --> 21:16.397
and the three other stiffs
l have in the deep freeze.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.062
Were they all brought in today?

21:18.194 --> 21:20.856
Yeah, they're really cutting
into my game time.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.775
[Tsks]
Gloves.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.944
Anyway, this particular dead guy
got shot in the head

21:26.077 --> 21:28.193
after an argument
with his neighbor Ollie Banks,

21:28.329 --> 21:30.490
accused him of hanky—panky
with his wife.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.204
So he got killed over an affair?

21:32.333 --> 21:33.539
Yeah, except that Ollie's gay.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.080
I happen to know that because
we go kayaking every summer.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.201
He's a friend of mine.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.249
But I did not know
that Ollie carried a gun.

21:39.382 --> 21:44.922
Anyway, Ollie said that this guy
was acting totally berserk.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.090
Now the drug screen
came back clean,

21:47.223 --> 21:50.590
so I'm thinking, you know,
stroke or tumor.

21:50.727 --> 21:54.219
lnstead, when I cut his head open,
I found this.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.061
I've never seen anything like it.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.476
That was in his brain?

21:57.609 --> 21:59.224
Yup.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.816
Whoa.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.027
And this was what was causing
his delusions?

22:03.156 --> 22:05.613
Yeah, well, it could be the symptom,
it could be the cause,

22:05.742 --> 22:07.573
but everybody I've seen today has it,

22:07.702 --> 22:09.567
and they've all met
with violent ends.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.444
Okay, so I don't want
to mix this up with my lunch.

22:11.581 --> 22:12.787
I'm gonna take it to the lab.

22:12.916 --> 22:13.826
But if you know anyone

22:13.958 --> 22:15.744
with this stuff
dancing around their brains,

22:17.170 --> 22:20.037
I don't want
any more customers today.

22:23.051 --> 22:24.382
Nathan.

22:41.736 --> 22:47.106
Wow, cleaner to chief
to cat burglar.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.573
It's been a big year for you.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.988
—Dwight, you're bleeding.
—Stay back.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.666
What you got there, Squatch?

23:02.799 --> 23:03.754
Murder weapon.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.215
Did you use this
to kill all those missing people?

23:06.344 --> 23:07.675
Did you kill Jordan, too?

23:08.596 --> 23:09.711
No.

23:09.847 --> 23:14.261
You don't tell me the truth,
I'm gonna cut it out of you.

23:18.690 --> 23:19.896
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.889
Look, l have been arrested
a bunch of times,

23:22.026 --> 23:24.984
and this is not proper procedure.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.024
—l'm just ——
—Why do you have this?

23:27.156 --> 23:30.148
—Why?
—I don't know.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.243
To torture myself.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.613
To punish myself.

23:38.042 --> 23:41.205
Frankly, I probably
should have thrown it away.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.253
But I didn't kill anyone.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.418
Then whose knife is this?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.792
Come with me.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.306
I'll show you.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.013
And you think those men
who took me

23:58.146 --> 24:00.933
have one of the troubles?

24:01.065 --> 24:02.601
Yeah, that must be
affecting Nathan,

24:02.734 --> 24:04.816
causing the black stuff
to grow in his brain.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.684
Well, it's making him
see and hear stuff.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.527
Wait, though,
I was with them for days.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.112
I mean, why am | not delusional?

24:10.825 --> 24:13.157
How are you feeling?
Do you feel weird?

24:14.203 --> 24:15.534
Really?

24:16.623 --> 24:19.239
Okay, no, yeah,
you're —— you're okay.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.706
But how about you?

24:20.835 --> 24:21.824
I mean, you were with them, too.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.703
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

24:26.341 --> 24:30.300
Well, it's a good thing
we have each other.

24:30.428 --> 24:34.091
But how do we solve this trouble
and stop the delusions?

24:34.223 --> 24:36.885
Well, it all started
with those two guys

24:37.018 --> 24:40.636
and their missing box,
so I say we go ask 'em.

24:47.904 --> 24:48.939
We're here.

25:02.752 --> 25:04.583
This is a good spot to bury you
if you make me do something

25:04.712 --> 25:06.248
you won't live to regret.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.417
You know, it's times like these
that make me hate the phrase,

25:08.549 --> 25:09.925
"Funny you should say that."

25:33.574 --> 25:35.781
"Crocker."

25:35.910 --> 25:37.070
What is this?

25:39.163 --> 25:41.119
This is where l buried Wade.

25:41.624 --> 25:45.242
I put a knife in my brother's chest,

25:45.378 --> 25:47.243
and then I put him in the ground.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.502
Wade murdered Jordan, didn't he?

25:52.635 --> 25:54.876
Maybe if I had told him the truth
from the beginning,

25:55.012 --> 25:56.297
he wouldn't have.

25:59.392 --> 26:03.476
He wouldn't have had to kill
all those troubled people on his own.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.640
I could have helped him.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.604
Dig him up.

26:12.113 --> 26:13.523
What'd you say?

26:13.656 --> 26:17.615
How do I know you're not lying?
That it isn't Jordan in that hole?

26:18.953 --> 26:19.988
Dig him up.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.361
Hey, Squatch...

26:22.123 --> 26:24.284
Dwight, stop!

26:25.460 --> 26:27.667
You got to be affected
by some kind of trouble.

26:27.795 --> 26:28.750
You're messed up.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.495
Your brother isn't here, so you ——

26:30.631 --> 26:32.496
you need to pay for Jordan,
for the others.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.009
Now dig him up.

26:35.887 --> 26:38.128
I'm not digging him up.

26:39.098 --> 26:39.723
Fine.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.305
[Grunts]

27:00.369 --> 27:03.497
You've been very quiet in here,
Nathan.

27:04.665 --> 27:05.529
Too quiet for someone

27:05.666 --> 27:07.202
whose girlfriend
just sent him packing

27:07.335 --> 27:10.543
so she could run around
with another man.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.672
I've got some pills for you.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.042
Why don't you take 'em all?

27:19.931 --> 27:23.048
I remember when | first met you.

27:23.184 --> 27:25.220
You were up in my face
trying to get me to hear things

27:25.353 --> 27:26.342
in that barn.

27:27.146 --> 27:30.434
"Jennifer,
did you hear anything new?"

27:30.566 --> 27:33.228
"Jennifer, you have
to find that door."

27:33.361 --> 27:36.728
"Jennifer, please tell me you heard
Audrey say that she loves me."

27:37.698 --> 27:39.950
killing you won't end
the troubles anymore.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.237
You're irrelevant.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.702
Put a gun in your mouth like a man.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.457
You're just sitting there.
Why aren't you doing anything?

28:00.555 --> 28:03.968
Going off half—cocked
isn't the answer.

28:05.226 --> 28:07.308
I need a permanent solution.

28:08.563 --> 28:12.147
You're going to kill William.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.516
Yes.

28:14.652 --> 28:17.564
Audrey's mine.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.731
Good.

28:23.578 --> 28:26.615
AUDREY: I'm getting sick and tired
of your non—answers.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.874
| just want my property back.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.956
I already told you ——
we don't have it.

28:31.085 --> 28:34.077
And you hurting people
isn't gonna help us find it.

28:35.006 --> 28:36.792
I think it will.

28:36.924 --> 28:37.959
How?

28:38.092 --> 28:41.129
How is hurting innocent people
gonna help me to remember? How?

28:41.262 --> 28:44.425
William, out now.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.977
We agreed you wouldn't
expose yourself to him, all right?

28:51.105 --> 28:53.141
We don't know
how his trouble works.

28:54.442 --> 28:57.309
Sorry.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.027
This would be so much easier
if I knew who I was.

29:00.156 --> 29:00.815
Listen ——

29:00.948 --> 29:02.734
[Sparks]

29:04.493 --> 29:06.905
—What was that? Was that you?
—No, it was ——

29:09.373 --> 29:11.159
Us.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.868
I knew you were special.

29:16.464 --> 29:19.831
You saved me from that barn,
and now you're here,

29:19.967 --> 29:24.677
so that makes you
pretty damn special, too.

29:34.315 --> 29:35.350
[Sparks]

29:35.483 --> 29:37.439
Ooh.

29:41.197 --> 29:45.657
Everything was collapsing into light,

29:45.785 --> 29:51.200
and —— and —— and I had the box.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.288
—You're remembering?
—No, no. Just ——

29:53.417 --> 29:54.532
Bits and pieces.

29:54.669 --> 29:58.161
Um, they were chasing me.
Uh...

29:59.507 --> 30:03.500
ljumped, landed on a hill
of some sort.

30:03.636 --> 30:04.500
It was dark.

30:04.637 --> 30:07.128
The whole town was lit up
beneath me.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.800
That sounds like the Haven lookout.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.133
But when they caught up to me,

30:12.269 --> 30:14.100
I didn't have the box.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.475
It's still got to be up there.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.065
[Gasps]

30:21.696 --> 30:24.563
Now we know where the box is.

30:25.533 --> 30:26.318
—Audrey.
—Huh?

30:26.450 --> 30:27.565
The big guy, he's gone.

30:27.702 --> 30:29.909
Literally, the cell's empty.

30:30.371 --> 30:31.952
He's gone after that box.

30:34.667 --> 30:35.952
Let's go.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.463
I can't believe
you actually tased me.

30:46.053 --> 30:48.089
Is anyone else seeing this?

30:48.222 --> 30:50.759
I'm being arrested, and for once,
I really didn't do anything.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.427
Yeah,|do.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.595
Oh, Audrey, thank you.

30:53.728 --> 30:55.559
He has been freaking out all day.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.144
I can't get through to him.

30:57.273 --> 30:59.355
I think he's being affected
by his abductor's trouble.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.599
—Nathan, too.
—And Jennifer.

31:01.736 --> 31:03.226
Sit down.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.772
—You need to un—cuff me.
—Yeah.

31:04.905 --> 31:06.281
NATHAN: You.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.607
—No, Nathan.
—Get away from Audrey.

31:09.744 --> 31:12.281
Don't you get tired?
Three men?

31:12.413 --> 31:14.119
How do you find time
to fight the troubles?

31:14.248 --> 31:15.488
What?

31:16.459 --> 31:18.791
Nathan, put the gun down, okay?

31:18.919 --> 31:20.420
All you're gonna end up doing
is shooting Dwight.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.753
Sorry, Dwight,
collateral damage.

31:23.424 --> 31:26.712
I've been shot before.
l'll shoot back.

31:28.721 --> 31:31.463
Nathan, William and l,
we know where the box is.

31:31.599 --> 31:32.964
Just let us go and get it.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.636
You can't trust a thing
this guy says.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.100
We need him out of the way.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.225
Code red!

31:41.108 --> 31:43.064
The Chief and Detective Wuornos
have been affected

31:43.194 --> 31:45.560
by some kind of toxic...

31:45.696 --> 31:46.651
Gas leak.

31:46.781 --> 31:48.692
Yes.
I need you to go.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.485
Okay?
I'm gonna track down the source.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.984
—Clear the building now!
—This way now!

31:53.120 --> 31:56.658
Everybody, let's move, move, move!

31:56.791 --> 31:59.123
Jennifer, there's no chance
that you'd un—cuff me right now?

32:05.007 --> 32:06.213
Get away from Duke.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.048
He's just been waiting for a chance
to kill us all, okay?

32:08.177 --> 32:09.633
I got enough juice in this thing

32:09.762 --> 32:11.844
to finally give you the execution
you deserve, okay?

32:11.972 --> 32:12.836
No, leave Duke alone!

32:12.973 --> 32:14.838
Everything that's happened
is Audrey's fault.

32:14.975 --> 32:15.509
What?

32:15.643 --> 32:18.055
Hey, I'm the true chief in this town!

32:18.187 --> 32:20.929
You don't do anything
without my say—so.

32:21.982 --> 32:22.892
[Grunts]

32:24.777 --> 32:27.439
Somebody really needs
to take that thing away from him.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.948
—Here.
—Yeah.

32:34.495 --> 32:36.736
Hey, you're gonna fit in
just fine around here.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.032
Duke.

32:38.165 --> 32:38.995
Dwight!

32:41.043 --> 32:42.544
Look, I'll keep a lid on this.

32:42.670 --> 32:43.830
You go find the box.

32:45.172 --> 32:48.380
Audrey, look, he's fine.

32:48.509 --> 32:50.124
He got the same shock I did.

32:52.429 --> 32:56.047
Your friend is right.
We have to get that box.

32:59.687 --> 33:03.020
imagine what they'll do
once they have it.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.563
Yeah.

33:09.864 --> 33:12.981
Let's all just breathe, okay?

33:13.117 --> 33:14.072
[Exhales]

33:24.420 --> 33:27.127
So that was kind of crazy
back there.

33:27.256 --> 33:30.919
—Yeah. Eye—opening.
—What do you mean?

33:31.051 --> 33:34.418
Well, the trouble thing seemed
to bring out the worst in people,

33:34.555 --> 33:37.547
and your friends got
a lot of the worst.

33:38.559 --> 33:41.767
—Okay, let's just find that box.
—Yeah.

33:41.896 --> 33:44.558
They just don't understand
how special you are.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.439
They don't deserve you.

33:47.568 --> 33:50.526
Oh, this looks familiar.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.314
Yeah.

33:55.659 --> 33:58.036
Yeah, this is it.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.777
[Both utter sighs of relief]

33:59.914 --> 34:01.950
Great. Okay, let's get it back
to the station.

34:02.082 --> 34:03.822
Oh, really?

34:03.959 --> 34:05.495
We've been running around all day.

34:05.628 --> 34:07.368
Let's enjoy the sunset.

34:07.504 --> 34:08.960
William, it's pretty important.

34:09.089 --> 34:12.126
Yeah, it is.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.884
But it's beautiful up here, isn't it?

34:18.015 --> 34:22.224
William, I think the trouble
that's affecting my friends,

34:22.353 --> 34:24.594
I think it may have gotten
to you, too.

34:27.107 --> 34:32.568
This isn't actually
about some stupid trouble.

34:35.241 --> 34:37.653
This is about us.

34:37.785 --> 34:39.275
Huh?

34:40.287 --> 34:42.994
Come on.
Why don't you take a seat?

34:43.123 --> 34:44.659
What are you talking about?

34:44.792 --> 34:46.999
I know it's all happening
a little fast,

34:47.127 --> 34:50.415
but you have no idea
how excited I was,

34:50.547 --> 34:54.005
how thrilled l was
to feel that spark between us.

34:54.134 --> 34:56.295
You've no idea
how long I've been waiting.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.804
When I touched you
back at the station,

34:57.930 --> 34:59.295
you knew what that was?

34:59.431 --> 35:01.137
Yes.

35:01.267 --> 35:05.101
It's what I've been praying for.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.390
When you came out of the barn

35:07.523 --> 35:10.139
and went right back
into being Audrey,

35:10.276 --> 35:13.609
I thought I'd lost you forever.

35:13.737 --> 35:17.980
But now I know
you are still in there.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.732
You remember the barn.

35:20.828 --> 35:23.365
| always did.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.988
And so much more.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.999
This field...

35:31.672 --> 35:33.833
This was our favorite place.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.548
We used to have such fun up here.

35:36.677 --> 35:38.633
And I know you don't remember that,

35:38.762 --> 35:42.254
but you will.

35:43.684 --> 35:46.266
You know what's in that box,
don't you?

35:46.395 --> 35:47.976
This?

35:52.985 --> 35:54.941
Yes.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.186
It's a gift.

35:58.449 --> 35:59.529
Open it.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.068
This whole day ——

36:01.201 --> 36:03.908
Dwight's kidnapping,
me finding you,

36:04.038 --> 36:05.574
the black goo,
all the delusions,

36:05.706 --> 36:08.118
all of that, that was you?

36:09.877 --> 36:10.912
VVhy?

36:11.045 --> 36:13.377
Open it.
You'll see.

36:31.565 --> 36:34.773
It's beautiful.

36:37.404 --> 36:38.814
You always loved it.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.448
Don't...

36:40.574 --> 36:42.155
touch me.

36:43.243 --> 36:46.451
Well, that's disappointing.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.751
But not altogether surprising.

37:03.097 --> 37:04.633
You work for him?

37:04.765 --> 37:07.097
No. Of course not.

37:09.144 --> 37:12.602
He works for me.
They both do.

37:13.399 --> 37:16.015
Let's get your partner back here.

37:20.447 --> 37:22.278
lf everybody weren't being
so unreasonable,

37:22.408 --> 37:24.319
we could all be sitting around

37:24.451 --> 37:27.067
playing poker, checkers,
what—have—you.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.407
I rest my case.

37:51.145 --> 37:52.180
JENNIFER: Oh, my God.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.519
—What was I doing?
—What just happened?

37:58.610 --> 38:01.067
The, uh ——
The little creepy guy,

38:01.196 --> 38:03.608
he's gone.

38:05.325 --> 38:08.283
Hey. Are you okay?

38:08.412 --> 38:11.370
Oh, my God, Duke,
I'm so sorry.

38:11.498 --> 38:13.705
Yeah, you were totally nuts.

38:13.834 --> 38:16.871
It's okay.
You can make it up to me later.

38:17.004 --> 38:19.040
Get me out of here.
I've got to go after Audrey.

38:19.173 --> 38:21.164
Here.

38:41.528 --> 38:44.110
Are you gonna use those things
on me for real now?

38:44.239 --> 38:45.740
What you did was a crime.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.069
But it was a crime
for the greater good.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.443
I'm not gonna arrest you, Duke.

38:50.579 --> 38:52.570
You've been punished enough.

38:52.706 --> 38:54.446
If I had known earlier,

38:54.583 --> 38:57.245
I could have taught him
how to control it like I did.

38:57.377 --> 38:59.242
And maybe ——

38:59.379 --> 39:02.086
maybe he wouldn't have
turned into such a monster.

39:02.216 --> 39:05.925
Hey, you did what you had to do
to make him stop.

39:06.053 --> 39:07.418
She's right.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.761
We've lost too many people
to the troubles.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.386
So your Crocker thing...

39:14.394 --> 39:16.100
Died with my brother.

39:17.940 --> 39:19.225
What's wrong?

39:19.358 --> 39:21.940
I thought you'd be happy
that the Crocker curse was gone.

39:22.069 --> 39:25.436
I didn't like your ability,
but it existed for a reason,

39:25.572 --> 39:27.483
to keep the troubles in check.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.698
Balance, counterbalance.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.693
What about you?
Why aren't you happy?

39:32.829 --> 39:34.615
Your trouble's gone.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.330
Yeah, it's gone...

39:38.669 --> 39:41.035
...but I still don't feel free.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.424
This isn't a game to me.

39:52.599 --> 39:56.467
I'm just trying
to get through to you.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.640
A few simple delusions,

39:59.773 --> 40:04.267
and your friends
tear each other apart.

40:06.905 --> 40:10.147
They're inferior, all of 'em.

40:10.284 --> 40:12.821
Them? Not us?

40:12.953 --> 40:15.035
Exactly.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.154
This is so frustrating.

40:17.291 --> 40:19.703
The barn's gone.
Why don't you remember?

40:33.974 --> 40:35.430
You.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.095
This wasn't your buddy's trouble.

40:38.228 --> 40:40.014
You infected my friends,

40:40.147 --> 40:43.230
and you put that mark
on those people.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.275
[PeeHng]

40:50.866 --> 40:54.529
Frankly, it was quite a chore.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.528
But it appears that I'm gonna need
to keep doing it.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.121
And quite a bit.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.626
VVhy?

41:01.752 --> 41:04.835
Because I want you back.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.001
Because I love you.

41:10.177 --> 41:14.295
And because you love me, too.

41:14.431 --> 41:17.764
There isn't any part of me
that will ever love you.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.724
Not Audrey Parker.

41:19.853 --> 41:22.060
And not Lexie
or any other Haven—savers.

41:22.189 --> 41:26.353
But there's someone else in there.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.227
The real you.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.195
And she?

41:37.079 --> 41:38.569
[Deep voice]:
ls mine.

41:45.545 --> 41:47.581
