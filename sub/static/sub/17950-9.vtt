02:21.942 --> 02:24.212
- FINE, I'LL TAKE THE TEST

02:27.748 --> 02:28.849
- WAIT.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.050
WHY DO I HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST?

02:30.050 --> 02:32.620

OKAY?

02:32.620 --> 02:35.789

02:35.789 --> 02:37.458
- BUT FIRST, DROP ME OFF

02:37.458 --> 02:39.627
- YOU GOT IT.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.765
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.739

02:54.508 --> 02:57.445
[bell rings]

03:01.249 --> 03:03.351
- OKAY,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.923
- THANK YOU.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.692
- WHY AM I EVEN HERE?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.927
I DON'T LIKE TESTS.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.397
WE DON'T GET ALONG.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.066

03:33.414 --> 03:36.850
IT'S TRUE; LOOK, WHEN YOU'RE
NEXT TO ME, GOOD THINGS HAPPEN.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.620
WHEN DEBBIE CRAWFORD SAID YES
TO THE SIXTH GRADE DANCE,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.355
YOU WERE NEXT TO ME.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.291
WHEN I SCORED MY FIRST
PEE-WEE HOCKEY GOAL,

03:43.291 --> 03:44.392

I WANT YOU TO SIT THERE,
BE LUCKY, AND TAKE THIS TEST.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.149
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE
THIS TEST.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.218
I WANT TO GO HOME
AND EAT CORN DOGS.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.354
- OKAY, I AM THE SMART ONE,
SO YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO ME NOW

04:13.354 --> 04:14.622
AND TAKE IT.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.225

04:18.225 --> 04:20.761
AND THE MEDICAL EXAMS BEGIN...

"IS HE A BAD BOYFRIEND?" TEST.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.359
- I'M NOT SURE I'M FOLLOWING--

04:51.359 --> 04:54.261
- WHY CAN'T I HAVE A MEANINGFUL
RELATIONSHIP LIKE YOU AND JO?

04:54.261 --> 04:55.363
AM I DOING SOMETHING WRONG?

04:55.363 --> 04:58.999
AND PERHAPS THE ANSWERS
ARE RIGHT HERE.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.970

WELL...
[chuckles]

05:14.648 --> 05:17.050

TAKES YOU OUT FOR COCOA."

THAT TEST,

05:20.521 --> 05:22.423
YOU HAVE TO BE...HONEST.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.957
- THAT WASN'T HONEST?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.059
- NO, IT'S JUST THAT I HAD
\A REALLY TOUGH DAY, AND...

05:26.059 --> 05:28.028

- HIMSELF.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.704
- AHH!

10:03.704 --> 10:06.774
GRIFFIN.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.911
- WE ARE DONE TESTING
YOUR PRODUCTS.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.781
- YOUR PRODUCTS ARE BAD.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.984
TEST OVER, AND YOU CAN'T KEEP US
HERE AGAINST OUR WILL.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.753
- NO, BUT THE RCM REMOTE
FAMILY SECURITY

10:19.753 --> 10:21.621
HOME CONTROL SYSTEM CAN.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.726
IT KEEPS UNWANTED INTRUDERS OUT
AND UNRULY TEENAGERS IN.

10:33.233 --> 10:38.371
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
UNTIL WE FINISH OUR TESTS.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.407
[slurping]

10:40.407 --> 10:41.341
AHH.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.347
- OH.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.650
OH, HONEY,
DID YOU DO BADLY ON THE TEST?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.052
- I DID TERRIBLE.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.454
- OKAY, OKAY, WELL,
IT WAS YOUR FIRST TRY,

10:54.454 --> 10:56.790
AND IT'S THE HARDEST TEST
IN THE WORLD.

10:56.790 --> 10:57.958
- OH.
OH, REALLY?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.659
OKAY, WELL, THEN,
HOW COME CARLOS ACED IT?

10:59.659 --> 11:00.861
- COME AGAIN.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.629
- 'SUP, MAMA KNIGHT?

11:02.629 --> 11:05.532
I'M GONNA BE A DOCTOR.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.135
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH

11:08.135 --> 11:10.037
- I'M THE SMART ONE.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.945
OKAY, SO YOU HIT A BUMP
IN THE ROAD,

11:17.945 --> 11:20.047
BUT SITTING ON THE COUCH
DEPRESSED

11:20.047 --> 11:21.749
IS NEVER THE ANSWER.

11:21.749 --> 11:24.284
- DEPRESSION, HUH.

11:24.284 --> 11:28.655
HMM, TAKE TWO CORN DOGS,
AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.024
- CORN DOGS ARE NOT THE ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.560
- OH, TRUST ME, IT IS.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.962
AND WHO'S THE SMART ONE?

11:34.962 --> 11:35.929
ME.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.333
NURSE,
SEND IN MY NEXT PATIENT.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.303
- I'M NOT A NURSE,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PATIENT.

11:43.303 --> 11:47.140
- THEN I'LL GO FIND
MY NEXT PATIENT.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.776
- DON'T ACTUALLY TOUCH ANYONE.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.544
- GOT IT.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.313
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO,
MRS. KNIGHT?

11:53.313 --> 11:54.948
MY FUTURE DOCTOR DREAM IS DASHED

11:54.948 --> 11:58.018
OH, AND...
CARLOS IS SMARTER THAN ME.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.587
- HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.
YOU'RE GONNA PICK YOURSELF UP.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.824
AND YOU'RE PICK ANOTHER
EXCITING FUTURE FOR YOURSELF,

12:03.824 --> 12:06.326
LIKE AN AIRLINE PILOT

12:06.326 --> 12:09.429
OR A POLITICIAN OR A LAWYER...

12:09.429 --> 12:10.497
- A STUNT MAN.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.832
- NO, THAT WASN'T ON MY LIST.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.333
- BUT IT WOULD BE EXCITING.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.468
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS BREAK
A FEW PLATES OVER YOUR HEAD

12:15.468 --> 12:18.205
AND FALL FROM THE SKY
AND STUFF.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.473
- NO, THERE WILL BE NO
BREAKING PLATES OR FALLING

12:20.473 --> 12:21.875
IN THIS APARTMENT.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.178
- OKAY, WELL, THEN I WILL
PRACTICE MY CAREER ELSEWHERE.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.183
[coughing]

12:30.183 --> 12:32.385
- SO...BOMBED YOUR TEST
AND LOOKING FOR

12:32.385 --> 12:34.054
AN EXCITING FALL-BACK CAREER?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.323
- I'M RETHINKING STUNTMAN.

12:36.323 --> 12:39.159
- OH, I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
A STUNT MAN.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.863
- YOU STAY A JANITOR.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.999
YOU...THE PALMWOODS IS OFFERING
A MANAGER TRAINEE PROGRAM.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.636
IT'S THE ULTIMATE JOB
WHEN YOUR DREAMS FAIL.

12:49.636 --> 12:50.838
- NEVER.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.076
- I'M SMARTER THAN LOGAN.

12:56.076 --> 13:01.014
AND HERE ARE TWO FROZEN CORN
DOGS TO STOP THE SWELLING.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.715
- CORN DOGS ARE NOT THE ANSWER.

13:06.119 --> 13:10.357
- OKAY, EVERYBODY,
STOP FALLING ON MY DESK.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.763
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.198
I'VE GOT SOME OF YOUR THINGS.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.468
HERE'S YOUR HOCKEY MAGAZINE
THAT I BORROWED,

13:21.468 --> 13:24.071
YOUR DRESS SHOES,
WHICH I POLISHED,

13:24.071 --> 13:26.473
OH, AND YOUR SNAP-TIGHT
RESCUE RANGER FIRE TRUCK.

13:26.473 --> 13:30.043
THE WHEEL WAS MISSING
WHEN I BORROWED IT.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.679
- OKAY,
IT WAS A BOYFRIEND TEST,

13:32.679 --> 13:34.081
WHICH WE ARE NOT.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.382
WE ARE BEST FRIENDS.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.584
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.119
- THEN YOU WON'T MIND TAKING

13:39.119 --> 13:42.189
LAST MONTH'S
"ARE YOU REALLY BESTIES?" TEST?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.523
- I'M LEAVING.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.125
- BEST FRIENDS DON'T LEAVE
BEST FRIENDS.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.526
- [sighs]

13:46.526 --> 13:47.928
HIT ME.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.564
- "DO YOU KNOW YOUR BESTIES
FAVORITE COLOR?"

13:51.564 --> 13:53.066
- PURPLE.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.401
- CORRECT.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.070
- "HAVE YOU BEEN ON CAMPOUTS
OR VACATIONS TOGETHER?"

13:57.070 --> 13:58.605
- WE LIVE IN THE SAME APARTMENT.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.574
- I'LL COUNT THAT AS A YES.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.110
"WHAT IS
YOUR B-F-F'S BIRTHDAY?"

14:03.110 --> 14:04.444
- SEPTEMBER 3RD?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.746
- EH!
4TH.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.181
"WHERE DID YOU MEET YOUR B-F-F?"

14:08.181 --> 14:09.649
- KINDERGARTEN?

14:09.649 --> 14:11.318
- DANNY CRAVEN'S
FIFTH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.685
[buzzer buzzes]

14:12.685 --> 14:13.921

14:13.921 --> 14:15.822
- EH!

14:15.822 --> 14:17.925

14:17.925 --> 14:19.993
[buzzer buzzes]

14:19.993 --> 14:22.729
APPLES...
NO, GRAPES.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.499
[buzzer buzzes]

14:26.499 --> 14:28.268
- MORE PURPLE-Y STUFF.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.302
[buzzer buzzes]

14:29.302 --> 14:30.470
CHEWBACCA.
[buzzer buzzes]

14:30.470 --> 14:32.805
THREE...NINE.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.174
- NO.
WRONG.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.308
EH!
NO.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.944
WRONG AGAIN.

14:39.612 --> 14:43.450
- SO HOW'D I DO...
BEST FRIEND?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.952
- YOU SCORED AN "A,"

14:44.952 --> 14:48.588
AS IN A PERSON
WHO IS NO LONGER MY BESTIE.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.495
- IT'S NO USE.
WE'RE TRAPPED.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.864
TRAPPED IN OUR OWN STUDIO.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.967
- AND WE'RE SURROUNDED
BY GRIFFIN'S CRAZY TESTS.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.634
- AND THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.237
- ACTUALLY,
THERE'S ONLY TWO TESTS LEFT.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.340
ONE, RCM'S INNOVATIVE WALL
CONFERENCING SYSTEM,

15:07.340 --> 15:08.575
WHICH WORKS GREAT.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.676
[both yelling]

15:12.879 --> 15:14.814
AND TWO, THIS THING.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.652
NOW, WHO WANTS TO TRY IT?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.325
- SWEETIE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE

15:25.325 --> 15:27.227
ON YOUR FUTURE CAREER TODAY.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.461
PLEASE.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.132
- [coughing]

15:32.132 --> 15:34.101
- SO FAR TODAY I'VE FAILED
AT STUNTMAN,

15:34.101 --> 15:37.837
BOOKS ON TAPE NARRATOR,
PET PSYCHIC, AND NOW CHEF,

15:37.837 --> 15:40.740
WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE LIKE
A DOCTOR IN THE KITCHEN.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.409
I'M CALLING IT.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.345
TIME OF DEATH:
NOW.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.320
- YOU AND ME ARE A LOT ALIKE,
LOGAN.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.621
- PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.057
- WE BOTH FAILED
AT OUR DREAM JOBS.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.259
[women screaming]

15:59.259 --> 16:01.561
- YOU'LL NEVER BE A STUNTMAN.

16:01.561 --> 16:06.033
- DON'T YOU CRUSH MY DREAMS.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.735
- LOOK, LIFE DOESN'T ALWAYS TURN
OUT THE WAY YOU'D LIKE IT TO.

16:08.735 --> 16:13.073
LIKE, HOW YOU FAILED
THE BIGGEST TEST OF YOUR LIFE,

16:13.073 --> 16:15.275
AND...
[sneezes]

16:15.275 --> 16:17.110
I'M COMING DOWN WITH A COLD.

16:17.110 --> 16:20.180
- HUH.

16:20.180 --> 16:23.416
HMM, YEP, YOU DO SOUND WARM.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.617
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

16:24.617 --> 16:25.818
A CORN DOG.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.088
- OH, COME ON.
CORN DOGS ARE NOT THE ANSWER.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.522
- I DO FEEL BETTER.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.158
- OH, HE'S FEELS BETTER.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.392
YOU FAILED.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.161
I PASSED.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.529
SMART ONE.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.731
- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'D FEEL BETTER

16:38.731 --> 16:41.801
IF YOU HAD A SOLID FUTURE
LIKE CARLOS.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.508
- DON'T BE TOO NICE
TO THE RESIDENTS.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.378
THEY WILL WALK ALL OVER YOU.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.780
- HEY, CAN I GET A NEW KEY CARD?

16:53.780 --> 16:57.717
- AHH!

17:01.588 --> 17:04.157
- YOU'RE A NATURAL.

17:04.157 --> 17:07.394
- TAKE TWO OF THESE,
AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

17:15.935 --> 17:19.339
- OKAY, SO I FAILED
THE BEST FRIEND TEST.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.473
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TOO.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.875
WHAT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR?

17:22.875 --> 17:23.910
- BLUE.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.578
YOUR FAVORITE FOOD
IS VEGGIE PIZZA.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.247
IF YOU COULD OWN ANY ANIMAL
IN THE WORLD,

17:27.247 --> 17:28.648
IT WOULD BE THE OCCELOT.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.817
THE NECTARINE
IS YOUR FAVORITE FRUIT.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.453
YOUR FIRST CRUSH WAS ELIN FEKETE
BECAUSE OF HER CUTE LAUGH,

17:33.453 --> 17:34.987
AND, OH,
DO I KNOW YOUR BIGGEST SECRET,

17:34.987 --> 17:36.356
AND I'D TELL YOU,

17:36.356 --> 17:39.259
BUT I SWORE THAT I'D SPEAK
THOSE WORDS OUT LOUD.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.794
- OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.830
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.133
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND HOW A GIRL
THAT YOU HAD

17:46.133 --> 17:48.701
A BIG CRUSH ON LEFT.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.903
AND YOU WANT TO TAKE A TEST
TO DEAL WITH IT,

17:50.903 --> 17:53.039
WE'LL TAKE A TEST.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.174
- WHAT MAGAZINE?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.008
- BEST FRIENDS ILLUSTRATED.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.312
TRUE OR FALSE:
JAMES DIAMOND IS AMAZING

17:59.312 --> 18:01.181
AND NEVER FEELS SORRY
FOR HIMSELF.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.315
- TRUE.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.252
- TRUE OR FALSE:
LUCY STONE WAS AMAZING

18:05.252 --> 18:07.854
BUT IS NOT THE ONLY AMAZING GIRL
IN THE WORLD.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.323
- [sighs]
TRUE.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.724
- WHEN JAMES DIAMOND
IS IN THE CRIB,

18:11.724 --> 18:14.261
AND THERE IS A POOL FULL
OF AMAZING GIRLS

18:14.261 --> 18:17.697
JUST DOWNSTAIRS, HE "A,"
FIGHTS WITH HIS BEST FRIEND

18:17.697 --> 18:20.833
OVER POP TIGER TESTS, OR "B,"

18:20.833 --> 18:24.171
RUNS DOWN THERE
AND GETS HIS POOL ON.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.072
- "B," POOL ON!

18:30.477 --> 18:31.978
LOOK, OUT LADIES.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.347
JAMES DIAMOND IS BACK.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.184
HA-HA-HA!

18:37.184 --> 18:39.219
- SO ARE YOU AND JAMES
ARE BACK TOGETHER?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.520
- YEP.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.957
- OKAY, WE ARE NOT TESTING
THAT THING

18:44.957 --> 18:46.659
TILL YOU TELL US WHAT IT DOES.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.196
- THE WEIGHT-I-ATOR IS
AN INTERNAL CELL ACCELERATOR

18:49.196 --> 18:52.465
THAT VIBRATES EXCESS WEIGHT
AT SUCH HYPER SPEEDS,

18:52.465 --> 18:56.903
IT REDUCES YOUR BODY SIZE
UP TO 20% INSTANTLY.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.274
NOW, WHO'S FIRST?

19:02.442 --> 19:03.710
COME ON.
IT'S REVOLUTIONARY.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.423
- AND NOBODY LEAVES
UNTIL WE TEST IT?

19:16.423 --> 19:18.691
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- THEN LET'S TEST IT.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.960
GREAT.
FULL POWER.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.330
THREE, TWO...

19:23.330 --> 19:25.532
[together]
NOW!

19:27.434 --> 19:30.703
- [mumbling]

19:38.811 --> 19:42.382
YES, THE WEIGHT-I-ATOR
IS A HUGE SUCCESS.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.584
- SO WE CAN GO NOW.

19:44.584 --> 19:47.019
- SURE.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.892
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET
WORKING ON A "REVERSE" SETTING.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.427
- DULY NOTED.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.263
both: MOVE OUT.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.535
- OKAY, WHAT IS GOING ON?

20:02.535 --> 20:05.171
- WELL, I'M OVER LUCY LEAVING.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.341
- AND JAMES AND I
ARE BESTIES FOREVER.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.142
- BUT LOGAN BOMBED
HIS MEDICAL TEST,

20:10.142 --> 20:11.944
AND CARLOS IS A DOCTOR.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.080
- OH.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.516
- HELLO, I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING
A PALMWOODS DAY.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.850
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

20:17.850 --> 20:20.453
- LOOK, I'M PRESCRIBING YOU
TO TAKE OFF THAT JACKET

20:20.453 --> 20:21.988
AND TRY AND BE A DOCTOR AGAIN.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.923
- NO, YOU'RE THE SMART ONE.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.157
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR NOW.

20:25.157 --> 20:29.496
- DR. CARLOS,
I STILL A BIT ACHY.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.332
- DID HE JUST PRESCRIBE A--

20:32.332 --> 20:33.566
[together]
YEP.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.901
- CARLOS,
FOR THE LAST TIME,

20:34.901 --> 20:37.370
CORN DOGS ARE NOT THE ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.239
- YES, IT IS.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.809
- WHAT?

20:42.809 --> 20:44.811
YOU GUESSED ON THE ENTIRE TEST?

20:44.811 --> 20:46.045
- ARE YOU SERIOUS.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.214
