02:07.831 --> 02:09.632
He won't get far.

02:14.538 --> 02:15.971
Help.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.733
<i>You still awake?</i>

05:04.274 --> 05:08.276
In the middle of a high speed chase.
This better be important.

05:09.112 --> 05:12.198
<i>I just feel so good knowing
you're out there keeping us safe.</i>

05:13.951 --> 05:15.817
And yours on your end?

05:16.200 --> 05:17.951
<i>There's a mess of chatter
from state police...</i>

05:18.051 --> 05:20.424
<i>...but it sounds like
they got it under control.</i>

05:20.757 --> 05:24.192
<i>Anyway, you're about up
so we'll see you when you get in.</i>

05:24.528 --> 05:26.060
Okay.

05:27.931 --> 05:29.664
Hold on.

05:31.435 --> 05:33.505
Looks like I got some kind of a...

05:35.305 --> 05:37.367
...drunk teenager.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.509
I don't know.

05:39.609 --> 05:41.345
Hey!

05:41.445 --> 05:44.630
Hey, buddy, you know it's a little cold
to be crawling all the way home.

05:48.719 --> 05:50.552
Stand by.

06:01.732 --> 06:03.601
Big night, huh?

06:11.942 --> 06:13.645
Holy shit.

06:15.178 --> 06:17.114
Dispatch, where am I taking this guy?

06:17.214 --> 06:19.750
<i>Closest emergency services
is still Marsh County.</i>

06:19.850 --> 06:23.457
<i>Not sure what's left of it after the fire.
I think they're moving, but they're...</i>

06:23.557 --> 06:27.624
- <i>...still listed on duty.</i>
- Okay, uh, how about Lakeland?

06:27.724 --> 06:31.346
<i>It's another twenty minutes at least.
It's your call.</i>

06:33.230 --> 06:37.568
Okay, you call ahead to Marsh. Let them
know it's me that's bringing him in.

06:37.668 --> 06:39.470
You call ahead.

06:55.819 --> 06:57.454
Can I get some help here?

06:57.554 --> 07:00.524
Uh, Bev, I need hands up front.
Bring a stretcher.

07:00.624 --> 07:03.894
- Dispatch not call ahead?
- What? We didn't get a call.

07:03.994 --> 07:08.029
- Bev! Uh, wanna get his feet?
- Yup, I'll get him.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.802
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

07:14.137 --> 07:15.773
Alright.

07:16.373 --> 07:20.477
- Are you okay? Can you hear me?
- What's his story, Danny?

07:20.577 --> 07:24.097
- Uh, he's bleeding, Bev.
- We're gonna take care of you.

07:24.197 --> 07:27.782
Beverly, we gotta get him on a monitor
and to see Dr. Powell. Let's go.

07:36.026 --> 07:37.558
Oh.

07:38.061 --> 07:39.463
Hi.

07:40.364 --> 07:43.600
<i>Coming back on the air after
an interruption due to technical problems.</i>

07:43.700 --> 07:46.269
- What's that about?
- Who knows.

07:46.369 --> 07:48.736
They won't let me do anything around here.

07:51.208 --> 07:53.513
Oh, here's a good one.

07:53.943 --> 07:55.720
De-gloving.

07:56.013 --> 07:59.416
- There's a picture.
- Ugh, Jesus.

07:59.816 --> 08:05.620
You know, statistically, you're more likely
to die in a hospital than anywhere else.

08:06.156 --> 08:09.860
- Cool.
- Well, I could give you a catheter.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.137
- That could be fun.
- Are you even a nurse?

08:13.864 --> 08:16.531
I am in training.

08:18.135 --> 08:21.701
That's so cool. How about
I'm just gonna go to sleep, okay?

08:22.272 --> 08:24.341
I should go anyway.

08:24.441 --> 08:26.674
I guess you won't be needing this.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.230
- Goodnight.
- <i>All messed up.</i>

08:30.330 --> 08:33.850
<i>Well, uh, in time, would you say
you ought to be able to wrap...</i>

08:38.455 --> 08:41.924
Well, you sure know how to
make an entrance, Danny boy.

08:42.025 --> 08:43.591
Yup.

08:45.512 --> 08:49.114
- How you feeling, Maggie?
- I've been having some pains.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.203
Dr. Powell says the baby
might be on it's way.

08:53.303 --> 08:57.164
Yup, she's kicking up a storm
in there that's for sure.

08:57.841 --> 09:01.478
Anyhow. I'm just glad the doc stuck around.

09:01.578 --> 09:04.948
That fire really did a number on this place.

09:05.048 --> 09:09.576
And I can't afford to be driving her into
the city every time that kid gets fidgety.

09:09.676 --> 09:11.923
Give it a rest, Grandad.

09:18.295 --> 09:20.927
- Let go of me! Stop!
- Calm down. Calm down.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.084
- Let go of me! Stop!
- One more second.

09:23.184 --> 09:26.868
- Just one more second.
- Easy. Breathe.

09:27.537 --> 09:30.608
- Okay.
- I'm not gonna miss this.

09:31.308 --> 09:35.078
- You gonna be able to handle him, Richard?
- Your friend here's had quite a trauma.

09:35.178 --> 09:38.448
Not that we have any ID bracelets left,
but for the record his name is James.

09:38.548 --> 09:41.418
- How bad is he?
- Well, he's not been very cooperative.

09:41.518 --> 09:45.521
The sedative will help us determine
exactly what his condition is, but...

09:46.221 --> 09:48.758
...our resources are limited here.

09:48.858 --> 09:51.489
Everything's been packed up for the move.

09:52.295 --> 09:57.179
Looks like James here isn't any stranger
to needles. Where'd you find this guy?

09:58.968 --> 10:01.173
He fucking bled on me.

10:04.174 --> 10:07.181
Kim, I know getting transferred over here
wasn't your first choice...

10:07.281 --> 10:09.980
...but you're supposed to be boxing up files.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.649
No, there are things called computers now.

10:14.050 --> 10:17.080
Can computers put files in boxes?

10:18.755 --> 10:20.596
Thank you!

10:24.194 --> 10:26.427
So old school.

10:37.824 --> 10:41.429
You might need something a little stronger
if you're gonna get that stain out.

10:44.381 --> 10:46.213
Whatever, fuck.

10:47.450 --> 10:51.486
- I can do my own laundry.
- Well! Look at you.

10:53.290 --> 10:56.924
Brought you, uh... coffee.

10:57.394 --> 10:59.863
Nice. I was looking for that.

10:59.963 --> 11:03.300
It's mine now so don't you get any ideas.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.999
Right.

11:07.470 --> 11:09.504
You're being friendly.

11:10.774 --> 11:12.540
It's good to see you.

11:17.414 --> 11:20.050
Uh... I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?

11:20.150 --> 11:21.685
- No, no.
- No. No, no, no.

11:21.785 --> 11:26.792
I'm just gonna go make sure Bev
hasn't murdered my intern. I'll see you.

11:31.027 --> 11:33.266
Our guest is out for now.

11:33.366 --> 11:37.267
He's not badly hurt, but it will be
a while before you can talk to him.

11:37.367 --> 11:38.860
Fuck.

11:40.437 --> 11:42.706
You should be gentle with Alison.

11:42.806 --> 11:45.642
She's still coming to terms
with what happened.

11:45.742 --> 11:49.220
- Yeah, okay.
- As you know, Daniel...

11:49.320 --> 11:52.340
...there's nothing worse than losing a child.

11:53.250 --> 11:57.454
When we lost Sarah, I was... I was a mess.

11:57.554 --> 12:00.621
It took a long time to come back from that.

12:01.858 --> 12:04.859
- You just have to keep going.
- Yeah.

12:48.471 --> 12:52.073
Beverly. Are you okay?

12:55.185 --> 12:58.163
Beverly. What?

12:59.706 --> 13:01.371
Jesus Christ.

13:08.425 --> 13:11.292
What the fuck are you doing, Bev? Beverly?

13:13.029 --> 13:16.541
- This isn't my face.
- What, Bev?

13:17.934 --> 13:21.504
No, no, don't do that. Bev!

13:21.604 --> 13:24.207
Put the scissors down. Look at me!

13:24.307 --> 13:26.529
Bev, okay, stop!

13:27.592 --> 13:29.406
It's not me.

13:30.547 --> 13:33.550
No, no, no, don't do that. Bev.

13:33.650 --> 13:37.701
- Can you help me?
- Bev, Bev, stop!

13:37.801 --> 13:41.015
No, no, no! Beverly, stop!

13:45.195 --> 13:46.896
Oh, fuck.

13:51.201 --> 13:52.900
Daniel!

13:53.903 --> 13:56.136
Daniel, what?

13:56.239 --> 13:57.941
- What did you do?
- What the fuck?

13:58.041 --> 14:01.178
- Kim. Kim, get out of here.
- Cliff?

14:01.278 --> 14:04.548
- Kim, you don't need to see this.
- I was... I was just...

14:04.948 --> 14:08.138
She came at me.
She came at me. Okay. Alright.

14:08.238 --> 14:11.221
- Was that a gunshot?
- Uh...

14:11.321 --> 14:13.223
My God, what happened?

14:13.323 --> 14:16.259
Beverly, she attacked Daniel
and the Robinson kid.

14:16.359 --> 14:19.684
- Okay, I gotta call this in. I gotta call...
- Give yourself a second. Just calm...

14:19.784 --> 14:21.657
Tell them. I gotta... just give me a second.

14:21.757 --> 14:24.598
- Can you just call from the office?
- Give me a second.

15:47.550 --> 15:49.819
- How are you feeling?
- What? I'm fine.

15:49.919 --> 15:51.604
- Shh.
- I'm okay.

15:51.794 --> 15:55.491
Take it easy, Daniel. It looks
like you might have had a seizure.

15:55.591 --> 15:59.829
No, no, no, no. If you're feeling dizzy,
Daniel, you shouldn't try to get up.

15:59.929 --> 16:03.133
- Okay.
- Just sit down, okay? Come on.

16:03.233 --> 16:06.803
- I gotta call it in.
- No, you need to take it easy.

16:06.903 --> 16:08.681
There's a state trooper already here.

16:08.781 --> 16:12.141
What? Oh, God, how long was I out for?

16:12.241 --> 16:14.821
Not long. Apparently,
he was already on his way.

16:14.921 --> 16:17.147
Something to do with that kid you
brought in. It's not important right now.

16:17.247 --> 16:21.184
This trooper's gonna wanna talk to you.
We should see about moving you to a room.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.218
No, no, no.

16:22.418 --> 16:26.089
You just experienced an extremely
traumatic event. Okay, look...

16:26.189 --> 16:30.159
...you are stubborn like your father was now.
You should take this very seriously.

16:30.259 --> 16:32.862
I am, I am.

16:32.962 --> 16:35.630
- I'm good.
- Alright.

16:36.866 --> 16:38.114
Daniel.

16:43.973 --> 16:45.439
Mitchell.

16:46.009 --> 16:47.877
There you are.

16:47.977 --> 16:51.014
So what happened? They told me
you found the two of them together.

16:51.114 --> 16:56.373
Uh, yeah. He was dead
when I arrived and, um...

16:56.973 --> 16:59.804
...she came at me with a pair of scissors.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.291
How did you get here so fast?

17:02.391 --> 17:04.444
- Your guy in the other room.
- What about him?

17:04.545 --> 17:07.763
We got a major bloodbath
about twenty miles north of here.

17:07.864 --> 17:10.532
Looks like he tore the place up
like a butcher shop.

17:10.633 --> 17:16.372
Uh, yeah. We looked him over and most
of the blood on his body was not his.

17:16.472 --> 17:18.907
Well, he has a long list
of drug related priors.

17:19.008 --> 17:21.411
So I think he gave your nurse something.

17:21.511 --> 17:23.980
I've got him cuffed to the bed
for the time being.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.199
He's been out cold.

17:26.299 --> 17:29.385
Well, I'm here now. I'll sort it out.

17:29.485 --> 17:31.589
I need to take your firearm.

17:31.941 --> 17:33.470
Yeah.

17:35.158 --> 17:37.427
You know, Carter,
your dad was a stand up cop.

17:38.327 --> 17:41.562
I wonder what he'd think
if he saw this shit show.

17:43.566 --> 17:47.404
Okay, we need to make sure everybody's
accounted for. Who else is here?

17:47.504 --> 17:50.339
Uh, Doctor Powell and Kim.

17:50.439 --> 17:54.043
Oh, and, um, Ben and Maggie. She's pregnant.

17:54.143 --> 17:57.627
- Christ, what a mess.
- Hey, uh...

17:58.227 --> 18:00.208
...do you mind if I call it in?

18:02.502 --> 18:04.051
Alright.

18:04.857 --> 18:06.321
Thanks.

18:52.001 --> 18:54.637
I'm not getting through in here.
Are you copying, Mitchell?

18:54.737 --> 18:56.618
I'm gonna try the car.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.873
<i>Copy.</i>

19:29.205 --> 19:32.408
Dispatch, this is Carter
at Marsh County. Do you copy?

19:39.182 --> 19:41.667
Dispatch, this is Carter
at Marsh County. Do you copy?

19:41.767 --> 19:44.253
I have a code three and I need assist.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.128
Fuck!

20:14.133 --> 20:15.666
Hi!

20:25.094 --> 20:27.327
What the fuck are you doing?

20:39.208 --> 20:41.360
Shit, shit!

21:17.180 --> 21:19.943
- Help!
- Daniel, Daniel, Daniel!

21:31.360 --> 21:34.564
Richard! He's losing a lot of blood.

21:34.664 --> 21:37.917
- Keep pressure over the wound.
- Daniel, it's fine. Look at me.

21:38.017 --> 21:39.957
Kim, I need you to bring me
a sutra kit and 8mg...

21:40.057 --> 21:43.172
- Keep your eyes on me, you hear me?
- Did you hear what I said?

21:43.272 --> 21:46.175
- Kim? Kim, what are you doing?
- Kim, did you hear me?

21:46.275 --> 21:48.841
For fuck's sake, come here.

21:48.941 --> 21:50.980
You'll be alright, Daniel,
you'll be alright. Keep breathing.

21:51.080 --> 21:54.961
Put both your hands here. Firm pressure.
Don't stop. You keep him awake.

21:55.061 --> 21:58.386
- Keep your eyes on him.
- Good boy, Daniel. Good boy!

21:58.486 --> 22:00.723
Kim! Don't let him close his eyes.

22:00.823 --> 22:04.227
- Hey! Stay awake.
- Stay awake, Daniel, stay awake.

22:04.327 --> 22:05.959
Hey!

22:23.746 --> 22:25.260
Daniel.

22:27.416 --> 22:28.983
Daniel?

22:31.554 --> 22:33.790
I've stopped the bleeding for now.

22:34.290 --> 22:36.187
Oh, thank God.

22:38.427 --> 22:39.762
- We know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:39.862 --> 22:41.361
Hey.

22:43.165 --> 22:45.600
Okay, maybe don't try to get up just yet.

22:47.603 --> 22:51.949
- What happened out there?
- Just give him a second.

22:52.608 --> 22:55.178
It looks like they've got
the place surrounded.

22:55.278 --> 22:57.480
- They're not trying to get in.
- Who are they?

22:57.580 --> 22:59.166
I don't know.

23:00.316 --> 23:02.451
I wasn't able to get through. You?

23:02.551 --> 23:04.283
No.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.055
We should move everyone back inside.
Who knows what they want.

23:07.345 --> 23:11.580
No, maybe we can...
barricade the doors or, uh...

23:11.680 --> 23:14.530
...you know, get out some other way.

23:16.299 --> 23:18.656
Shit. I forgot about him.

23:24.006 --> 23:25.942
Do something!

23:26.042 --> 23:27.908
Fucking shoot it!

23:28.661 --> 23:31.346
Oh, my God, please! Do something!

23:33.649 --> 23:35.458
Help me!

23:40.006 --> 23:41.674
Help me!

23:41.774 --> 23:44.191
Oh, my God, fucking help me, goddammit!

23:45.494 --> 23:48.130
Help me, help me!

24:06.082 --> 24:08.051
What is that?

24:08.351 --> 24:10.353
I think that was Beverly.

24:13.056 --> 24:16.525
- Jesus, what the hell was that?
- We're leaving. Now, now, now, now.

24:18.060 --> 24:19.595
Hey, that's not a good idea, Daniel.

24:19.695 --> 24:22.565
Wait, wait, wait. What about
those fucking lunatics out there?

24:22.665 --> 24:25.704
We got other things to worry about,
believe me. Mitchell, Mitchell!

24:25.804 --> 24:28.767
You and I, let's go get the cars, okay?
Are you with me?

24:30.940 --> 24:33.642
- What the hell was that?
- Make safe, back up.

24:33.742 --> 24:36.345
- Stay away from the doors! He's got a gun.
- Back, back, back.

24:36.445 --> 24:38.446
Okay, make safe. Make safe.

24:38.546 --> 24:40.982
Okay, okay, drop it!

24:42.738 --> 24:45.021
Whoa! Okay, drop it! Drop it!

24:45.121 --> 24:46.873
- Fuck you.
- Get the fuck back.

24:46.973 --> 24:49.224
- Okay, put it down.
- Stay calm, stay calm.

24:49.324 --> 24:52.793
- Everybody, just stay calm!
- Stay the fuck away from me!

25:00.836 --> 25:02.704
Calm down!

25:05.374 --> 25:08.311
Okay! Put down the gun, it's okay.
Everybody just calm down.

25:08.411 --> 25:11.764
- Calm down, you said? No, no, no.
- Richard, Richard, Richard.

25:11.864 --> 25:14.500
- There's no reason to involve her in this.
- Richard.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.420
It's not gonna help you. Listen.

25:18.120 --> 25:21.144
Just give me the knife
and this will all be over.

25:22.024 --> 25:25.578
- It isn't gonna help you.
- Richard, I don't know what to fucking do!

25:25.678 --> 25:27.563
Don't worry, Maggie.

25:27.663 --> 25:30.102
He's not going to hurt you.
Just let me have it.

25:32.468 --> 25:36.005
- No!
- Richard! Kim, Kim!

25:36.105 --> 25:38.199
I got him, I got him.

25:42.912 --> 25:44.047
Kim.

25:45.651 --> 25:49.618
- Look at me, look at me, look at me.
- We are not gonna die in this fucking place!

25:49.888 --> 25:53.271
Nobody wants to be in here any longer
than we have to. Believe me.

25:53.371 --> 25:55.643
He's not going anywhere.

25:58.406 --> 26:00.272
Fucking idiot!

26:11.407 --> 26:14.674
- Alright.
- What the fuck was that?

26:15.011 --> 26:18.227
Kim, sweetheart, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.362
Fuck's sake, he stinks.

26:24.053 --> 26:25.587
Mitchell!

27:03.526 --> 27:05.393
Stay back!

28:28.027 --> 28:29.893
Oh, fuck.

28:40.889 --> 28:43.359
Get in the office.
Get in the office now. Now, now!

28:43.459 --> 28:45.227
- Get in the office.
- Okay, go to the office!

28:45.327 --> 28:47.630
- What the fuck was that?
- I'm not gonna argue with you.

28:47.730 --> 28:50.933
- You need to tell me what's in there.
- I don't know what's in there.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.868
- But please, just go.
- Watch the door.

28:52.968 --> 28:55.704
- Okay. You hold on. Who are you?
- Get the fuck away from me.

28:55.804 --> 29:00.009
Whoa, whoa, just slow down. Who are you?
Who are you? Just tell us that.

29:00.309 --> 29:02.216
- I want him. Alright?
- Okay, look.

29:02.316 --> 29:05.245
Alright. I think we all agreed that we
need to get the hell out of this building.

29:05.345 --> 29:09.400
- These personal differences, they're...
- Oh, Daniel!

29:09.885 --> 29:11.387
Stop.

29:11.787 --> 29:13.923
No one is going anywhere.

29:14.023 --> 29:17.226
- Okay, alright.
- Okay.

29:17.326 --> 29:19.762
We don't know anything about this place.

29:20.262 --> 29:23.129
If you let us here, we can trust them.

29:23.499 --> 29:25.467
You don't need to do this. You...

29:25.567 --> 29:28.768
- Stop!
- He can't answer you.

29:29.104 --> 29:30.705
Shaun!

29:32.875 --> 29:36.113
See? That's what the last people
he trusted did.

29:36.213 --> 29:38.296
No, you're making a mistake.
You can trust us.

29:38.396 --> 29:40.215
I don't think so.

29:42.218 --> 29:44.520
Wait, wait! Please, please! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:44.620 --> 29:46.789
Get your hands off me.

29:46.889 --> 29:48.754
Are you okay?

29:49.525 --> 29:52.192
You calm down. Okay, we're good.

29:55.731 --> 29:57.499
You wanna go through all this again?

29:57.599 --> 30:01.969
I know you believe me when I tell you
we don't know what the fuck is going on.

30:02.069 --> 30:06.873
There were things growing out of her.
You saw it, you saw it. What was that?

30:08.244 --> 30:13.115
We could, uh, burn what's left
of the place. Take them all with it.

30:13.215 --> 30:16.352
Okay, listen to me.
We didn't do anything to you.

30:16.452 --> 30:18.894
I have a girl back there
who's about to give birth...

30:18.994 --> 30:21.824
- ...and I need to get her some place safe.
- Are you fucking kidding?

30:21.924 --> 30:25.281
Have you had a look outside lady?
There's nowhere to go.

30:25.381 --> 30:29.665
You can hear those horns for miles.
There is something calling them all here.

30:29.765 --> 30:33.069
- Okay, what is that? Who are they?
- How the fuck should I know?

30:33.169 --> 30:36.402
- Go ask them!
- It's okay, it's okay.

30:36.772 --> 30:39.441
All I know is that that thing
woke up once already...

30:39.541 --> 30:42.542
...and I don't wanna be around
when it happens again.

31:01.497 --> 31:04.498
Oh, there's a problem. Maggie.

31:05.934 --> 31:07.803
I didn't know what to do.

31:07.903 --> 31:10.737
Okay. Hey, sweetie.

31:12.548 --> 31:14.411
Are we leaving?

31:15.561 --> 31:18.197
No, not just yet.

31:27.656 --> 31:29.658
Would you put that out?

31:29.958 --> 31:31.360
Al.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.862
- What, this?
- Yeah.

31:33.962 --> 31:36.632
- Put it out.
- Okay.

31:36.732 --> 31:39.435
I think we all should just remain calm.

31:39.535 --> 31:43.071
Bullshit. We should've been
out of here already.

31:43.171 --> 31:46.209
- You people need to wake up.
- Or what?

31:47.109 --> 31:51.747
You think you'll stand a chance if there's
another one of those things out there?

31:51.847 --> 31:54.329
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Will you, huh? Who's gonna stop it?

31:54.429 --> 31:57.686
Grandpa? The teenage fucking slut.

31:58.186 --> 32:01.189
- Come on now!
- Whoa, whoa! Come on.

32:01.289 --> 32:05.426
- We're gonna die.
- No, we're not gonna die. You're gonna die.

32:05.526 --> 32:07.745
I'm not gonna let that happen.

32:12.090 --> 32:13.600
Okay.

32:16.105 --> 32:18.774
I don't know what the fuck you think
you're trying to do. Okay? Calm down.

32:18.874 --> 32:22.044
- He's upsetting her and that is not good.
- I need you to stay calm.

32:22.144 --> 32:25.013
Can you please tell me
what is going on over there?

32:25.113 --> 32:29.217
Her contractions are spread out, but she's
having abdominal pain which is a bad sign.

32:29.317 --> 32:31.620
I don't know what that means.
What does that mean?

32:31.720 --> 32:36.359
That means that we can't move her.
It can make things much worse.

32:37.259 --> 32:40.916
Also the last thing I need is to be
performing a cesarean in the middle of this...

32:41.016 --> 32:45.033
...but I have nothing here to help her and
if I don't do anything the baby could die.

32:45.133 --> 32:48.470
I need to go to the med supply room.
So I'll go.

32:48.570 --> 32:52.341
Alone? No, no, no,
that's out of the question.

32:52.441 --> 32:56.111
I'm not asking. We need to handle this now.

32:56.211 --> 32:59.882
Alright. Okay, look.
We have no idea what is out there.

32:59.982 --> 33:01.917
We have no way of defending ourselves.

33:02.017 --> 33:05.387
Plus these two fucking psychos
now think that we're hostage.

33:05.487 --> 33:07.523
I'm doing this.

33:07.923 --> 33:10.692
You're not. You're not. You're not even...

33:10.792 --> 33:14.629
If this is because of the baby then you
need to get a fucking mental check.

33:14.729 --> 33:16.766
This is not about us.

33:17.966 --> 33:19.859
That girl...

33:20.159 --> 33:23.005
...if she suffers an abruption
then her baby will die.

33:23.105 --> 33:24.964
If I try to take it out of her...

33:25.064 --> 33:28.942
...and I don't use anesthetic
then she could die of shock.

33:29.745 --> 33:31.811
Daniel, look at me.

33:35.050 --> 33:38.519
Okay, fine. Fuck it, fuck it. Uh...

33:39.855 --> 33:43.006
Okay, but you're not going alone.
You have to promise and wait for me, okay?

33:43.106 --> 33:44.970
- You promise?
- Okay.

33:45.070 --> 33:46.672
Alright.

33:52.268 --> 33:54.534
May I approach?

33:58.023 --> 34:01.030
The girl's not doing well
and neither is the baby...

34:01.130 --> 34:03.200
...so we need to go...

34:04.074 --> 34:06.282
...and get some things to help her.

34:06.382 --> 34:08.257
What do you want from us?

34:08.617 --> 34:11.687
Well, I have a shotgun in my cruiser.

34:11.786 --> 34:13.822
I have ammunition.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.792
We just fought our way in here.

34:16.891 --> 34:19.828
I'm not gonna just stroll back out again.

34:19.928 --> 34:21.681
Okay, but...

34:21.781 --> 34:24.433
...as far as I can tell
we're all in the same boat.

34:24.533 --> 34:29.638
You've got a rifle without any bullets
and a couple of fucking fire axes.

34:29.737 --> 34:33.542
I just... it's close and we can do it fast.

34:37.779 --> 34:41.824
Alright, but we're not
risking our lives for you.

34:42.150 --> 34:45.621
We get that gun, it's ours.

34:45.821 --> 34:47.623
Oh, absolutely.

34:47.723 --> 34:50.159
Abso-fucking-luteley.

34:50.759 --> 34:52.326
Okay.

35:05.874 --> 35:08.277
I thought you said it was close.

35:08.377 --> 35:10.443
What the hell?

35:10.913 --> 35:12.948
It's still out there.

35:13.248 --> 35:16.685
Yeah, but what are they waiting for?

35:16.985 --> 35:18.990
Let's just make this quick.

35:20.389 --> 35:22.658
Shotgun's locked on the front seat.

35:23.358 --> 35:25.828
I gotta release it, but...

35:27.028 --> 35:28.912
...you get all the ammo out of the trunk.

35:33.469 --> 35:35.736
Don't get any bright ideas.

35:37.639 --> 35:39.908
Hey, hold up.

35:40.008 --> 35:41.775
Goddammit.

35:43.979 --> 35:45.881
What if they don't come back?

35:45.981 --> 35:48.217
Daniel knows what he's doing.

35:49.835 --> 35:51.670
It's alright.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.426
I shouldn't even be here right now.

35:54.526 --> 35:57.626
I should be at Lakeland
turning over patients.

35:57.726 --> 35:59.261
Fuck this place.

35:59.361 --> 36:02.530
Well, you're stuck with us now,
Kim, so deal with it.

36:04.566 --> 36:06.355
How you doing, honey?

36:06.455 --> 36:08.268
It hurts.

36:10.105 --> 36:12.772
What's gonna happen to my baby?

36:17.312 --> 36:19.181
Listen to me.

36:19.281 --> 36:22.184
You and your baby are going to be fine.

36:22.284 --> 36:24.350
You have my word.

37:01.023 --> 37:02.602
Shit.

37:08.397 --> 37:09.831
Fuck.

37:09.931 --> 37:12.367
What the fuck are you doing in there?

37:56.244 --> 37:58.680
What the fuck's going on in there?

37:58.780 --> 38:01.616
- Ah, shit.
- K, time's up.

38:01.716 --> 38:03.785
That's our cue to leave.

38:11.626 --> 38:13.653
Come on, goddammit!

38:14.129 --> 38:15.961
Fuck's sake!

38:18.767 --> 38:20.920
Fucking hurry up!

38:21.837 --> 38:23.671
Look out!

38:27.609 --> 38:29.643
I'm keeping the fucking gun.

38:40.222 --> 38:42.485
This place isn't gonna keep anything out.

38:48.430 --> 38:50.896
Oh, my God. Hey.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.536
- Fuck.
- What happened?

38:54.636 --> 38:57.339
- Here, here.
- Where's Allie?

38:57.439 --> 39:00.475
Well, she went to get
some medicine for Maggie.

39:00.575 --> 39:02.811
- Where?
- The med room.

39:02.911 --> 39:04.813
Jesus Christ.

39:04.913 --> 39:07.115
She said there wasn't anything
to worry about inside.

39:07.215 --> 39:09.682
Are you guys in the same fucking building?

39:10.752 --> 39:13.361
Would you please wait here, look after them?

39:13.461 --> 39:16.856
Excuse me, sir, would you mind
following me? Thank you.

39:19.094 --> 39:21.029
<i>That kid will be fine.</i>

39:21.129 --> 39:24.466
He's been through a lot worse.
Those people killed his family.

39:24.566 --> 39:29.437
- I barely got him out of there alive.
- Yeah, what about you, man of mystery?

39:29.537 --> 39:34.709
Mind your own business. And by the way,
pretty stupid to go running off by herself.

39:34.809 --> 39:38.433
Okay, I'm pretty certain you can beat
the shit out of me, but I consider it...

39:38.533 --> 39:43.216
...my special privilege to hate my wife now
so if you could kindly shut the fuck up.

40:04.472 --> 40:06.527
This is Mitchell's gun.

40:20.629 --> 40:22.155
Look.

40:48.149 --> 40:49.690
What?

41:38.133 --> 41:39.999
<i>Hello, Daniel.</i>

41:43.071 --> 41:45.140
Who is this?

41:45.240 --> 41:47.109
<i>You saw...</i>

41:47.509 --> 41:48.910
<i>...something.</i>

41:49.010 --> 41:51.454
<i>I felt it when you woke up.</i>

41:52.781 --> 41:54.648
<i>But what was it?</i>

41:58.453 --> 42:00.935
<i>I can show you more if you'd like.</i>

42:05.093 --> 42:06.828
Hi, Richard.

42:06.928 --> 42:09.715
<i>I'm sure it's hard for you to understand.</i>

42:10.365 --> 42:12.881
<i>Beverly found it difficult as well...</i>

42:14.059 --> 42:17.097
<i>...but I assure you...</i>

42:17.897 --> 42:20.187
<i>...my intentions are altruistic.</i>

42:26.081 --> 42:27.620
Please...

42:28.992 --> 42:31.080
...tell me what you've done.

42:33.922 --> 42:35.469
Richard.

42:36.624 --> 42:38.458
Richard, tell me.

42:40.195 --> 42:42.061
Tell me!

42:42.647 --> 42:46.559
<i>You're trying so hard to follow
in your father's footsteps, Daniel.</i>

42:49.604 --> 42:52.672
<i>Do you really wanna follow him
where he's gone?</i>

42:54.743 --> 42:58.276
<i>I understand how desperate loss can make you.</i>

42:59.981 --> 43:02.809
<i>The night you brought Alison to me,
the life inside her...</i>

43:02.909 --> 43:05.666
<i>...desperately clawing to get out.</i>

43:06.554 --> 43:10.574
<i>Losing my daughter changed me, but...</i>

43:11.074 --> 43:14.126
<i>...but I'm doing what I have to
to make it right.</i>

43:15.046 --> 43:17.043
<i>You'll understand soon enough.</i>

43:18.333 --> 43:22.417
Just please, can you please
tell me where Alison is? Just...

43:25.023 --> 43:28.209
You tell me, goddammit.
You tell me where she is.

43:28.309 --> 43:30.345
<i>Don't worry, Daniel.</i>

43:30.745 --> 43:32.548
<i>I'm gonna help her.</i>

43:33.248 --> 43:35.517
<i>I'm gonna help all of you.</i>

44:00.708 --> 44:03.211
This is crazy! I don't know what I'm doing.
You can't just leave us.

44:03.311 --> 44:06.736
Kim. We don't have a choice. Alison's the
only one who knows how to look after Maggie.

44:06.836 --> 44:10.751
Please, look. Just...
these still seem to work inside.

44:10.851 --> 44:13.721
- No.
- We'll keep in touch just in case.

44:13.821 --> 44:16.180
We're not gonna be gone long,
we're not going far. Look.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.994
It hurts. It hurts so bad.

44:19.094 --> 44:22.063
I don't know what half this stuff is!

44:22.163 --> 44:25.087
- Please, please don't...
- Listen to me. Listen to me, please.

44:25.187 --> 44:27.894
We're just gonna down there,
I'm gonna bring back Alison...

44:27.994 --> 44:30.105
...and I need you to hold out
until then, alright?

44:30.205 --> 44:32.407
What if something happens?
What if those people get in here?

44:32.507 --> 44:36.444
- What are we supposed to do?
- Those people are not trying to get in here.

44:36.544 --> 44:40.248
Those people are trying
to keep us from getting out.

44:40.348 --> 44:43.084
Okay, that's the best that I can do.

44:43.184 --> 44:45.450
I hope you know how to use it.

44:46.354 --> 44:48.156
And, uh...

44:48.756 --> 44:50.725
...that's there just in case.

44:50.825 --> 44:53.028
You better know what you're doing.

44:56.631 --> 44:57.949
Okay, let's go.

44:58.049 --> 45:01.840
You think were just gonna go
down there and that'll be that?

45:02.871 --> 45:06.551
If you have something to say
than say it, you smug fuck.

45:07.508 --> 45:09.544
Do you know what's down there?

45:10.044 --> 45:11.510
Nope.

45:15.416 --> 45:17.864
But I know someone who might.

45:21.122 --> 45:24.092
Hey. Hey, meth boy.

45:24.192 --> 45:27.162
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, good, you remember us.

45:27.262 --> 45:30.198
It's not my fault, okay? You gotta
believe me. I didn't fucking do anything.

45:30.298 --> 45:32.100
- Just save it. Save it!
- Please help me!

45:32.200 --> 45:34.402
- These guys are gonna kill me!
- Hey!

45:34.502 --> 45:36.571
You're gonna wanna pay attention
to my questions.

45:36.671 --> 45:39.477
Please. No, wait, wait, wait!
Oh, God, please don't!

45:39.577 --> 45:41.579
- Alright, pick a finger.
- Don't do this.

45:41.679 --> 45:45.814
- No, no, you didn't ask me anything yet!
- I wanna make sure you know I'm serious.

45:45.914 --> 45:48.648
- I believe you, okay? I fucking believe you.
- Okay, okay, hey!

45:48.748 --> 45:51.653
Do you know anything that will help
keep us safe? Anything at all.

45:51.753 --> 45:54.289
Anything that will help us survive.

45:54.389 --> 45:56.658
It's the fucking doctor.
It's that fucking doctor.

45:56.758 --> 46:00.628
Okay, fine, we know that already.
We don't have time for this.

46:00.728 --> 46:03.198
- You know what? Make it clean.
- No, no, please. It is him.

46:03.298 --> 46:05.933
It's him and I killed him. I swear
to God I did you a fucking favor.

46:06.033 --> 46:09.351
- Yeah, well, he's not dead anymore.
- How is that possible?

46:09.771 --> 46:11.923
What? Oh, God.

46:12.673 --> 46:14.678
Oh, no, no!

46:16.378 --> 46:20.115
- Look at me, look at me!
- Oh, God!

46:20.215 --> 46:23.045
Stop! Listen to me.

46:23.851 --> 46:27.355
- How is he alive? What is he?
- I don't fucking know.

46:27.455 --> 46:30.325
- Okay, take his hand off.
- No, no, please, please!

46:30.425 --> 46:32.593
I don't know, I'm serious.
I met a girl on the road.

46:32.693 --> 46:36.167
Fucking please, please, please. I met
a girl on the road and she told me...

46:36.267 --> 46:39.583
...she could help me score crystal so
I followed her to this fucking pill house.

46:39.683 --> 46:43.972
- Except it wasn't a pill house.
- What was it? What was it?

46:44.072 --> 46:47.575
It was an old farm house
in the middle of nowhere.

46:47.675 --> 46:49.410
All of these fucking junkies.

46:49.510 --> 46:52.845
It was a mess. It looked like
they'd been killing people for a while.

46:53.614 --> 46:55.616
He gave us drugs.

46:55.716 --> 46:58.602
He watched us have sex.
And he called the place a church.

46:58.702 --> 47:02.123
What you're telling me that Richard was
some kind of sex fiend, religious thing?

47:02.223 --> 47:04.776
My dad knew him for years,
we all did. That's bullshit.

47:04.876 --> 47:06.477
They were dressed just like this.

47:06.627 --> 47:09.597
There's a bunch of people
dressed like this, okay?

47:09.697 --> 47:14.669
And they did killings and sacrifices
and they made us watch!

47:14.769 --> 47:17.104
You're talking devil worshiping?

47:17.204 --> 47:20.775
No. No, I don't believe in the devil.

47:20.875 --> 47:24.012
Okay, but I believe in this.
They made people change.

47:24.112 --> 47:26.948
I saw it. Thank you.

47:27.048 --> 47:29.684
You're coming with us.
There's no reason to thank us.

47:29.784 --> 47:31.636
- What?
- Yeah.

47:31.736 --> 47:33.755
You know what? We're gonna
visit your friend in the basement.

47:33.855 --> 47:34.839
No!

47:34.939 --> 47:35.990
- Mhm.
- Are you nuts?

47:36.090 --> 47:38.926
No, you've seen he can do.
Let's just get out of here, okay?

47:39.026 --> 47:42.630
- Fuck this place.
- Yeah? Have a look. Go on.

47:42.730 --> 47:45.867
- Be my guest.
- No, this is suicide.

47:45.967 --> 47:50.238
Oh, my God. No, you're as crazy as they are.

47:50.338 --> 47:52.427
Yeah, maybe.

48:02.717 --> 48:04.550
Down here.

48:07.729 --> 48:10.126
Looks like this place is gonna collapse.

48:14.429 --> 48:16.462
<i>Can you hear me okay?</i>

48:18.132 --> 48:19.734
Loud and clear.

48:19.834 --> 48:23.502
<i>The stairwell to the basement
is at the back of the building.</i>

48:25.239 --> 48:27.072
Roger that.

48:27.442 --> 48:29.274
Got it.

48:53.534 --> 48:56.524
Look. Someone's been here.

49:17.858 --> 49:19.710
<i>Kim! Where are we going?</i>

49:19.810 --> 49:23.497
The door to the morgue
should be right there in front of you.

49:30.438 --> 49:33.841
I don't see any door.
Just a bunch of corridors.

49:33.941 --> 49:37.745
- You sure this is the right place?
- He went down the wrong stairs.

49:37.845 --> 49:41.690
There's only one set of stairs.
I know where they're going.

49:42.416 --> 49:43.982
Hello?

49:44.452 --> 49:45.985
Carter!

49:47.922 --> 49:50.727
Better not be leading us into a trap.

49:55.863 --> 49:57.570
What's going on?

50:03.438 --> 50:07.075
- <i>Oh, you gotta be kidding me.</i>
- Did you find it?

50:08.175 --> 50:10.745
<i>Is there some kind of sub-basement or...</i>

50:10.845 --> 50:13.714
No, no, no, what are you talking about?

50:13.814 --> 50:17.084
- <i>A staircase going down.</i>
- What?

50:26.301 --> 50:29.613
Carter, can you hear me?

50:43.077 --> 50:44.910
We gotta go back.

50:46.113 --> 50:50.349
I can't ask you to follow me
down here. You understand?

50:52.186 --> 50:54.019
<i>Guys, what's happening?</i>

50:58.059 --> 51:00.061
Nothing. We're...

51:00.561 --> 51:02.828
...we're gonna go down the stairs.

51:07.134 --> 51:11.739
Hey, leading in with him.
Hey, you get to go first.

51:11.839 --> 51:15.273
- Yeah, right.
- I'm not asking.

51:16.143 --> 51:17.744
Quiet.

51:44.805 --> 51:48.006
Don't bother. You won't be able to move.

51:53.182 --> 51:56.517
- Richard?
- Be patient.

51:56.617 --> 52:00.221
- I'm almost ready.
- What... what is this?

52:00.321 --> 52:03.588
I... I saw you die.

52:05.259 --> 52:08.663
I had no idea that it would feel like this.

52:09.363 --> 52:11.833
The years I spent operating on people.

52:12.583 --> 52:16.671
Opening them up and stitching them
back together again.

52:17.671 --> 52:20.508
It's remarkable, the sensation it's...

52:21.308 --> 52:24.885
...not pain, more a sense of release.

52:24.985 --> 52:28.884
- Why... why are you...
- Be quiet, please.

52:29.584 --> 52:31.599
This is uncharted territory.

52:32.953 --> 52:36.858
The chance to study my own transformation.

52:36.958 --> 52:40.418
I understand your hesitation, Alison...

52:40.918 --> 52:42.932
...but let me ask you...

52:43.832 --> 52:48.569
...all these years, haven't you ever
wished to save someone beyond saving?

52:48.669 --> 52:50.901
No matter what the costs?

52:52.640 --> 52:55.706
Well, losing Sarah destroyed me.

52:59.030 --> 53:01.675
<i>But it also compelled me to find a solution.</i>

53:03.951 --> 53:07.191
You'd be surprised at the things you find...

53:07.741 --> 53:09.633
...when you go looking.

53:21.268 --> 53:23.548
It smells like a grave.

53:35.683 --> 53:37.952
I've seen this place before.

53:38.052 --> 53:40.721
This was all over the house we cleaned out.

53:40.821 --> 53:45.500
He made us look at things.
The worst things I've ever seen.

53:45.693 --> 53:49.464
We found rooms full of bodies
in the basement of that place.

53:49.664 --> 53:54.335
They had someone on a table like
they were doing surgery down there.

53:54.435 --> 53:57.138
- Half turned into one of those things.
- No!

53:57.238 --> 54:00.474
No, worse than that.

54:00.574 --> 54:02.610
Like a nightmare.

54:05.012 --> 54:06.847
It isn't real.

54:06.947 --> 54:08.816
It's not real.

54:18.125 --> 54:20.182
It's a rat's maze.

54:23.197 --> 54:24.800
Carter!

54:26.300 --> 54:28.369
Is he here?

54:28.669 --> 54:31.438
Hey! Yeah.

54:31.538 --> 54:35.029
He has took me here to... baby.

54:35.129 --> 54:39.714
I'm right here, kiddo. It's okay,
it's alright. You're gonna be fine.

54:39.814 --> 54:42.783
You're lucky your grandpa
cares about you so much.

54:42.883 --> 54:46.107
My grandpa just yells at his TV and smokes.

54:47.788 --> 54:52.760
- Shit! Shit, okay, okay! Wait, wait.
- Help her, help her. Help her, please.

54:52.860 --> 54:54.605
- The paradigm, I think.
- Alright.

54:54.705 --> 54:57.531
Okay, Maggie, hold still for one second.

54:57.631 --> 55:01.769
I got this. Okay. I'm gonna give you
something that's really gonna help you.

55:01.869 --> 55:04.585
It's gonna feel really good.
You're doing real good.

55:04.685 --> 55:07.975
It's gonna be real painless.
It's gonna be okay in a second.

55:08.075 --> 55:10.845
- Okay, okay.
- Just give me a second. Okay, okay.

55:11.245 --> 55:14.447
Okay, you gotta hold her still.
You gotta hold her still.

55:15.282 --> 55:17.952
Easy, once I get this in. Okay, ready?

55:18.052 --> 55:19.884
There you go.

55:21.221 --> 55:24.358
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's okay.

55:24.458 --> 55:27.726
There's no problem. No problem.

55:55.856 --> 55:57.191
Great.

55:57.291 --> 56:00.392
I'm not going in there. Fucking shoot me.

56:11.906 --> 56:13.405
Hey.

56:16.944 --> 56:18.813
This is it.

56:18.913 --> 56:20.981
This is what?

56:21.481 --> 56:24.158
I appreciate your enthusiasm...

56:24.258 --> 56:26.359
...but we need to think this through.

56:43.604 --> 56:45.437
This is a mistake.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.500
Come here, you little fuck.

56:57.718 --> 57:00.372
<i>Do you know where you go when you die?</i>

57:02.022 --> 57:03.857
<i>I do.</i>

57:04.157 --> 57:06.929
You travel on, reborn into something else...

57:07.029 --> 57:09.263
...like a caterpillar becoming a moth.

57:09.363 --> 57:13.267
Until now I've only been able
to track the moth in its cocoon.

57:13.367 --> 57:17.638
The body has to adjust, of course. It adapts.

57:17.738 --> 57:20.974
We weren't built for this kind of thing.

57:21.884 --> 57:25.913
I admit, early on I made mistakes.

57:26.613 --> 57:30.618
Some of those earliest mistakes
are still down here with us.

57:32.553 --> 57:36.390
In fact, they caused the fire
that destroyed this hospital.

57:36.990 --> 57:38.882
You see...

57:39.771 --> 57:43.565
...they want to die, but I won't let them.

57:47.334 --> 57:50.671
Don't cry, Alison. I am going to help you.

57:50.771 --> 57:55.576
This is an end to the cycle
of life and death.

57:55.676 --> 57:58.525
Do you really want this world?
This world that took your son from you?

57:58.625 --> 58:02.249
Do you know what happened
that night to your unborn child?

58:02.349 --> 58:05.886
- No, please.
- Umbilical cord became entangled.

58:05.986 --> 58:08.587
Simple as that. Strange, isn't it?

58:09.023 --> 58:11.525
The very lifeline between
you and your child...

58:11.625 --> 58:14.929
...constricting like a noose around
his neck as he struggled to get out.

58:15.029 --> 58:20.067
Tighter and tighter until finally
it couldn't struggle anymore.

58:20.367 --> 58:23.201
Nature's futility.

58:24.004 --> 58:25.873
I can stop it.

58:26.573 --> 58:28.807
This is the first real step.

58:30.044 --> 58:32.277
The true resurrection.

58:34.148 --> 58:37.161
I lost my daughter to the abyss...

58:38.469 --> 58:40.477
but tonight...

58:41.055 --> 58:44.258
- ...I am calling her back.
- Richard.

58:44.358 --> 58:45.894
Please.

58:46.794 --> 58:48.430
Don't do this.

58:51.198 --> 58:54.035
But it's already done.

59:06.814 --> 59:09.750
You are so beautiful, Alison.

59:09.850 --> 59:14.028
You will become something truly remarkable.

59:39.880 --> 59:42.151
This is a slaughter house.

59:48.622 --> 59:52.290
- Get this off of me!
- Shut the fuck up!

59:52.927 --> 59:55.596
I should've killed you back at the house.

59:55.696 --> 59:57.962
Get a hold of yourself.

01:00:05.672 --> 01:00:09.143
- Is she alright?
- She feels hot.

01:00:09.243 --> 01:00:11.113
Oh, God.

01:00:11.435 --> 01:00:14.568
- Lord! Do something!
- Oh, God, okay! Okay.

01:00:18.685 --> 01:00:21.519
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Fuck you.

01:00:21.989 --> 01:00:26.293
Look around us, huh?
I told you. This was a mistake.

01:00:26.393 --> 01:00:28.227
He knows something.

01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:37.702
<i>We need you with us.</i>

01:00:45.312 --> 01:00:48.348
He's in his head! He's in his head!

01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:56.222
Stop it!

01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:21.315
We're in hell.

01:01:37.764 --> 01:01:40.365
You've got to hold her still!

01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:44.422
It's gonna be okay! It's gonna be okay!

01:01:49.343 --> 01:01:50.941
That's the front entrance!

01:02:05.792 --> 01:02:06.760
Where are you going?

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.627
Wait, goddammit!

01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:23.454
- God, I can't do it!
- You have to!

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:38.414
We're gonna die!

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:59.914
No! No! No! No!

01:03:11.058 --> 01:03:15.228
You do what you have to do!
I'll keep those bastards out.

01:03:15.328 --> 01:03:17.464
I can't kill her.

01:03:17.564 --> 01:03:19.597
You have to do this.

01:03:20.934 --> 01:03:23.570
You are the only chance she has.

01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:25.289
- No.
- Please!

01:03:25.389 --> 01:03:29.907
- Sorry, I can't.
- Please do this!

01:03:32.045 --> 01:03:34.078
Oh, my God!

01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:40.685
Why did you do that?

01:03:46.226 --> 01:03:48.328
It's finally time.

01:03:48.428 --> 01:03:50.462
How could you?

01:03:50.997 --> 01:03:52.866
Your baby.

01:03:53.216 --> 01:03:56.468
Doctor Paul is a great man.

01:03:57.503 --> 01:04:00.138
I'm lucky to carry his child.

01:04:02.075 --> 01:04:04.543
Nothing else matters now.

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:17.803
Don't worry.

01:04:19.443 --> 01:04:21.728
Everything is about to change.

01:04:21.828 --> 01:04:24.260
Get the fuck away from me!

01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:38.389
Just wait.

01:05:45.412 --> 01:05:47.278
Just... just wait.

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:52.467
What do... what do we have to do?

01:05:55.255 --> 01:05:57.088
Just wait.

01:06:00.744 --> 01:06:02.545
This is your fault.

01:06:08.635 --> 01:06:10.440
This is your fault!

01:06:19.346 --> 01:06:23.350
I wasn't there. You should've protected them!

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:26.851
Mother wants us to stay.

01:06:29.189 --> 01:06:31.358
I told you, look after them.

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:34.094
But you stayed here.

01:06:34.194 --> 01:06:36.948
You should have protected them!

01:06:39.758 --> 01:06:41.539
Stay here.

01:07:06.092 --> 01:07:07.895
I'm sorry.

01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.583
What is this?

01:07:26.946 --> 01:07:29.297
Carter, Carter, Carter!

01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:37.822
<i>Carter, where are you?</i>

01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:42.063
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up,
shut the fuck up.

01:07:43.383 --> 01:07:45.243
Shut up.

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:55.425
Fuck!

01:08:21.334 --> 01:08:23.136
<i>Daniel?</i>

01:09:05.912 --> 01:09:07.546
<i>Daniel?</i>

01:09:14.854 --> 01:09:17.890
- Alison.
- Where are you?

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:19.393
I'm scared.

01:09:19.493 --> 01:09:23.596
No, no, no, no. Alison, I'm right here.
I'm right here. I'm right here.

01:09:23.697 --> 01:09:26.196
Look at me, it's okay.

01:09:30.356 --> 01:09:32.420
Oh, I can feel it coming.

01:09:36.743 --> 01:09:38.542
Oh, wow.

01:09:39.112 --> 01:09:41.178
Hold my hand.

01:09:42.982 --> 01:09:45.051
I need you.

01:09:45.151 --> 01:09:47.018
I'm not gonna leave.

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:51.723
Daniel.

01:09:56.996 --> 01:09:58.864
I know your secret.

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:03.026
<i>I saw it in your face.</i>

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:06.972
<i>The night Alison lost your child.</i>

01:10:11.177 --> 01:10:14.386
<i>I saw relief.</i>

01:10:21.988 --> 01:10:23.791
What have you done?

01:10:24.511 --> 01:10:26.936
I've given her what she wanted.

01:10:28.778 --> 01:10:30.402
She's a mother.

01:10:31.648 --> 01:10:33.867
Isn't she beautiful?

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.847
Daniel.

01:10:56.822 --> 01:10:58.358
Stay.

01:11:49.275 --> 01:11:51.342
Do you see, Daniel?

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.324
Tell me what you see.

01:12:05.692 --> 01:12:07.559
I see...

01:12:09.595 --> 01:12:11.398
...a monster...

01:12:12.393 --> 01:12:14.544
...that thinks he's God.

01:12:16.202 --> 01:12:18.071
I'm disappointed.

01:12:18.371 --> 01:12:20.790
Of all the things I've shown you...

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:24.046
...and you still don't understand.

01:12:24.246 --> 01:12:25.790
No.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.782
No, you're right, I don't.

01:12:28.882 --> 01:12:32.052
I refuse to let death be the end.

01:12:32.152 --> 01:12:34.220
I defy God.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.489
There are things much older.

01:12:36.589 --> 01:12:40.360
Older than time and they blessed me.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:43.330
Well, congratulations.

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:49.202
I spent my life resisting death,
but now I understand.

01:12:49.302 --> 01:12:51.371
I must embrace it.

01:12:51.771 --> 01:12:54.407
I'll have my beautiful daughter back.

01:12:54.507 --> 01:12:58.124
I just need one final thing.

01:13:07.654 --> 01:13:10.721
Come, join me.

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:34.045
The others have all gathered
to witness my daughter's rebirth.

01:13:35.048 --> 01:13:37.288
My disciples...

01:13:37.388 --> 01:13:40.487
...ready for their own transformation.

01:13:42.121 --> 01:13:45.140
You'll experience it yourself...

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.072
...but first...

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:49.575
...you have to die for me...

01:13:49.895 --> 01:13:53.131
...like your father and son before you.

01:13:56.169 --> 01:13:58.836
You've done wonderfully, my dear.

01:14:01.941 --> 01:14:03.877
Now watch.

01:14:04.377 --> 01:14:07.384
You will be my audience.

01:14:13.252 --> 01:14:15.396
Watch the abyss...

01:14:15.496 --> 01:14:17.926
...open itself to me.

01:15:09.725 --> 01:15:11.800
Calvin, bless my baby.

01:15:26.392 --> 01:15:30.104
Place my daughter into this vessel.

01:15:35.668 --> 01:15:37.301
Yes.

01:15:38.871 --> 01:15:40.901
Give yourself to her.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.546
Let her come to be.

01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:59.559
It's her.

01:15:59.659 --> 01:16:01.294
You see?

01:16:25.334 --> 01:16:26.936
Hey!

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:58.751
Look out!

01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:23.807
Do it!

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:26.453
Do it!

01:17:36.376 --> 01:17:38.188
Do it!

01:17:41.461 --> 01:17:43.140
Do it.

01:18:19.799 --> 01:18:23.067
We will all be saved.

01:18:25.471 --> 01:18:28.872
Everything has led to this.

01:18:50.112 --> 01:18:52.996
I can see it all before me.

01:18:53.599 --> 01:18:56.634
The infinite astro workings.

01:18:58.103 --> 01:19:00.738
It's beautiful.

01:19:26.899 --> 01:19:28.943
Don't fight it, Daniel.

01:19:33.839 --> 01:19:36.273
I can give Alison to you.

01:19:38.077 --> 01:19:40.278
That's what you want, isn't it?

01:19:41.714 --> 01:19:43.947
She's waiting for you.

01:19:44.483 --> 01:19:48.534
All you have to do is let go...

01:19:48.634 --> 01:19:50.849
...and you can be together.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:56.627
That's a good boy.

01:19:57.597 --> 01:20:00.798
This isn't the end.

01:20:12.979 --> 01:20:14.545
Yes.

01:20:15.915 --> 01:20:17.514
Yes.

01:20:19.285 --> 01:20:20.786
Yes.

01:22:56.475 --> 01:22:58.210
Is it over?

01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:00.165
Is it over?

01:23:01.305 --> 01:23:07.381
