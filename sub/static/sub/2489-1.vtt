<i>It's 2:18 in the morning
in the middle of February.</i>

00:44.671 --> 00:47.799
<i>I've been sitting on a park
bench for almost four hours.</i>

00:48.633 --> 00:50.468
<i>I'm fucking freezing.</i>

00:53.638 --> 00:55.473
<i>Why am I sitting here?</i>

00:55.557 --> 00:58.143
<i>Why am I still
sitting on this bench?</i>

00:59.018 --> 01:01.396
<i>You know, it's
probably best if I rewind.</i>

01:01.479 --> 01:03.982
<i>If I back up and explain.</i>

01:04.899 --> 01:07.485
<i>Every relationship arrives
at a critical moment,</i>

01:08.236 --> 01:09.446
a <i>juncture,</i>

01:09.529 --> 01:12.532
<i>between moving forward
and moving on.</i>

01:13.533 --> 01:15.994
<i>I call that moment the "so."</i>

01:16.244 --> 01:17.328
So...

01:17.871 --> 01:20.039
Where is this going, then?

01:20.123 --> 01:23.585
I think you're a... Like...
I think you're amazing.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.295
I think you're
an amazing girl. I...

01:29.420 --> 01:30.860
I think you're an amazing person.
No.

01:30.884 --> 01:32.427
I'm breaking up with you.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.262
Ihaveto.
You're breaking up?

01:34.345 --> 01:37.474
I'm sorry, Jason, I need
somebody who's ready.

01:37.557 --> 01:41.060
I need somebody who doesn't drink
coffee out of a cereal bowl.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.437
What?

01:42.562 --> 01:43.855
And has a bed frame.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.624
<i>I wasn't confused
because she was</i>

01:45.648 --> 01:47.192
<i>breaking up with me.</i>

01:47.275 --> 01:48.693
I'm so late for work.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.072
<i>I was confused because I had
no idea we were dating.</i>

01:55.283 --> 01:57.786
I'm not even close
to the guy you need.

01:57.869 --> 01:59.621
The guy you deserve.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.414
Like... I'm...

02:01.873 --> 02:04.042
And I'm so sorry that
I can't be that guy.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.044
<i>In her defense,
we'd been having sex, like,</i>

02:06.127 --> 02:07.962
<i>once a week for six weeks.</i>

02:08.922 --> 02:10.715
I'm so late for work.

02:11.216 --> 02:13.092
<i>But in my defense,
that's a hookup</i>

02:13.176 --> 02:14.886
<i>approaching the seeing stage.</i>

02:14.969 --> 02:16.596
I'm sorry, Jason.

02:17.055 --> 02:18.681
No. I understand.

02:19.641 --> 02:20.642
I understand.

02:20.725 --> 02:23.061
<i>And what I understood was,
at that moment,</i>

02:23.144 --> 02:25.772
<i>we were definitely not dating.</i>

02:44.286 --> 02:45.726
<i>Dude, did you
get my message?</i>

02:45.750 --> 02:46.918
Man, I left,
like, 10 minutes ago...

02:48.127 --> 02:50.408
<i>Come on, man. You're late. Look,
what have you been doing?</i>

02:50.463 --> 02:51.589
What have I been doing?

02:51.673 --> 02:53.007
Christy just broke up with me.

02:53.091 --> 02:55.593
<i>Oh, man.
Who's Christy?</i>

02:57.095 --> 02:58.763
Vera, you home?

03:01.599 --> 03:03.768
Oh. I didn't know
we had company.

03:04.769 --> 03:05.769
You're home early.

03:05.812 --> 03:07.438
Yeah, I skipped the gym.

03:08.481 --> 03:10.275
Oh, uh, this is my lawyer.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.609
Oh, your lawyer.

03:12.819 --> 03:14.654
Actually,
he's a very good lawyer.

03:14.988 --> 03:16.406
Is everything okay?

03:17.448 --> 03:19.784
So your wife said that she
was having intense sex?

03:19.868 --> 03:20.952
Yes, intense.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.078
I can't believe
she said, "intense."

03:22.161 --> 03:23.663
That's what she said.
With a guy named Harold.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.583
And while she said this, her
lawyer was just sitting there?

03:26.666 --> 03:27.959
He looked like Morris Chestnut.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.628
Who the fuck is Morris Chestnut?

03:30.712 --> 03:31.713
<i>From Boyz n the Hood.</i>

03:31.796 --> 03:32.881
Ricky?
Yeah.

03:32.964 --> 03:34.591
Dude, I love Ricky.

03:35.091 --> 03:36.634
Not anymore.

03:36.718 --> 03:37.802
Who the fuck looks
like Morris Chestnut?

03:37.927 --> 03:39.387
Yeah. That's not a strong look.
Her lawyer.

03:39.470 --> 03:41.472
Her lawyer looks
like Morris Chestnut.

03:41.556 --> 03:43.141
Okay, and he was just
sitting there on the couch?

03:43.224 --> 03:45.393
Yeah, why was he just
sitting there on the couch?

03:48.313 --> 03:50.398
'Cause she wants a divorce.

03:52.442 --> 03:53.443
<i>That's...
Fuck, man.</i>

03:53.568 --> 03:55.153
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry.

03:55.236 --> 03:56.404
And here's the kicker,
her lawyer,

03:56.487 --> 03:57.530
the guy sitting there,

03:57.614 --> 03:59.324
the guy that looks
like Morris Chestnut,

03:59.449 --> 04:01.034
is the guy
she's having sex with.

04:01.159 --> 04:02.452
Harold?
Harold!

04:02.535 --> 04:04.329
Fuck Harold.
Oh!

04:04.996 --> 04:05.996
Oh, man.

04:06.039 --> 04:07.874
Did...
Did he say anything?

04:09.125 --> 04:10.525
He said
he liked my shoes.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.211
What?
He said what?

04:12.503 --> 04:14.589
He said he liked my shoes.

04:19.177 --> 04:20.261
Well...

04:20.345 --> 04:22.555
He's not wrong.
They're cool shoes.

04:24.974 --> 04:27.060
What the fuck, man?
I don't deserve this.

04:27.143 --> 04:29.437
I don't know what
we're going to do, man.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.939
We need to get him a hooker.

04:31.022 --> 04:32.023
We can't afford a hooker.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.858
Yeah, we can use a coupon. Get
him a cheap hooker. It's Mikey.

04:33.983 --> 04:35.401
No, we're not. Look. "East
Village girls for hire."

04:35.485 --> 04:36.485
No.
Right there.

04:36.527 --> 04:37.570
No.
Yeah.

04:37.654 --> 04:38.613
According
to this article,

04:38.696 --> 04:40.657
most of the bars on the East
Side are filled with hookers.

04:40.740 --> 04:41.741
You know what I love about you

04:41.824 --> 04:44.535
is that you literally believe
every single thing that you read.

04:44.619 --> 04:45.620
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

04:45.703 --> 04:46.746
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

04:46.829 --> 04:47.914
It's like you're nine years old.

04:47.997 --> 04:49.749
Ooh, no, no, no. They're
like young, cool hookers.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.153
They dress like
hipsters and shit.

04:51.167 --> 04:52.687
And I'm telling you
that I highly doubt

04:52.710 --> 04:54.045
that that is the case.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.129
Then why would
it be in a magazine?

04:55.213 --> 04:56.297
I don't know.

04:56.381 --> 04:57.757
Read it.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.885
"She dresses like any
other pretty young thing,

05:00.969 --> 05:03.304
"knee-high boots
strewn about the floor,

05:03.388 --> 05:05.598
"and a drawer filled
to the hilt with condoms

05:05.682 --> 05:07.883
"seemed the only indication
of her sideline occupation."

05:07.934 --> 05:08.977
How awesome is that?

05:09.060 --> 05:11.104
Hey guys. It's Fred.

05:11.187 --> 05:12.188
Hey, Fred.

05:13.231 --> 05:15.316
You know it's not
a phone. Right?

05:16.275 --> 05:17.610
You're actually here, Fred.

05:17.694 --> 05:18.820
We can see you.

05:18.903 --> 05:19.904
Totally.

05:21.531 --> 05:22.657
Oh!

05:22.740 --> 05:26.244
So you're due to present
on the Silverman book.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.246
So...

05:30.248 --> 05:32.667
You guys are
prepared? Right?

05:32.750 --> 05:34.419
We'll be in there.

05:37.672 --> 05:38.965
That's a blank board.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.093
That's a gold mine.

05:42.844 --> 05:45.513
I mean, we gave you
stacks of examples.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.932
You mean these. Right?

05:48.016 --> 05:49.600
What you're seeing
there is exactly

05:49.767 --> 05:51.352
what you're gonna
see everywhere else.

05:51.436 --> 05:52.520
And we can deliver that.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.857
<i>But</i> when <i>we're talking about
The Unexpectable Princess...</i>

05:55.940 --> 05:57.025
Which is a great title.

05:57.150 --> 05:58.192
It's a wonderful,
wonderful title.

05:58.276 --> 05:59.610
But still, it's drowning

05:59.694 --> 06:02.488
in a sea of boring pastel.
Uh-huh.

06:02.572 --> 06:03.614
That's not what you want.

06:03.698 --> 06:05.283
And that's not what you need.

06:05.327 --> 06:06.487
I think I know what you need.

06:06.492 --> 06:07.535
I think he does.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.537
A book's cover
should hint at the story.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.122
But not give away too much.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.582
This is about wish fulfillment.

06:15.168 --> 06:18.337
Black and white.
Cool and spare.

06:19.047 --> 06:22.091
Now, a recent study using MRls

06:22.175 --> 06:24.594
showed that women's brains
lit up like fireworks

06:24.677 --> 06:26.179
when they were
showed pictures of...

06:26.262 --> 06:27.263
A penis.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.514
What?

06:30.767 --> 06:31.851
No. No.

06:31.976 --> 06:33.061
No.

06:33.144 --> 06:34.228
No.
No.

06:34.604 --> 06:36.064
No.

06:36.147 --> 06:38.399
Women's brains
lit up like fireworks

06:38.483 --> 06:41.069
when they were
showed pictures of

06:42.653 --> 06:44.405
shoes.
Shoes.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.075
Shoes.

06:47.158 --> 06:51.913
And nothing says wish fulfillment
like Christian Louboutin.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.625
Ask any girl in the room.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.338
I love it.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.883
Dude, are you
taking a shit in there?

07:03.966 --> 07:04.966
Absolutely not.

07:05.009 --> 07:06.886
Every time you come over,
you take a shit in there.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.430
I'm not taking a shit.
I'm using self-tanner.

07:09.514 --> 07:10.514
Self-tanner?

07:10.556 --> 07:12.183
Yeah. I told that
assistant at <i>Vogue</i>

07:12.308 --> 07:13.851
I couldn't hang out
'cause I was in Toulon.

07:13.935 --> 07:16.145
Trying to phase her
out of my roster.

07:16.229 --> 07:18.147
Also, lam taking a shit.

07:18.231 --> 07:19.315
Every time.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.900
Every time.

07:24.362 --> 07:25.488
You did
the retrieve? Huh?

07:25.571 --> 07:27.406
I just grabbed whatever I could.

07:29.136 --> 07:31.136
Yo, Mikey! Were you
taking a shit in there?

07:31.160 --> 07:33.079
Yep.
Jesus! Every time.

07:33.204 --> 07:34.789
We're going the fuck out.
Is that ice cream?

07:34.872 --> 07:36.312
You bought ice cream, Mikey?
Come on.

07:36.374 --> 07:37.542
Yeah.
It's peanut butter chocolate.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.960
That's a great flavor.
Let me see it.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.723
Hey. We're going out. No ice cream.
No. No.

07:40.795 --> 07:42.797
You see, whiskey doesn't
mix well with ice cream.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.382
Ineedit
Oh, you need it?

07:44.549 --> 07:46.509
Yes. You need it? What're
you, a fat teenage girl?

07:46.551 --> 07:47.635
What're you, Bridget Jones?
Really?

07:47.718 --> 07:49.262
Name calling? Is that
what we're doing? Yeah.

07:49.345 --> 07:50.429
Give me the ice cream.
No.

07:50.555 --> 07:52.306
Give me the ice cream. I know that look.
Get away from me.

07:52.390 --> 07:53.391
Give me the ice cream.
Back up, little man.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.268
Give me the ice cream.
Get off, man.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.353
Nobody gets ice cream!

07:57.436 --> 07:58.437
That was awesome.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.522
Did you throw it out the window?

07:59.605 --> 08:00.648
We're going out.

08:01.232 --> 08:04.026
I mean, I bet you thought you were
never going feel this again, man.

08:04.110 --> 08:06.654
The excitement. The energy. You
don't get this in relationships.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.072
I've been out of
the game so long

08:08.156 --> 08:09.615
I forgot how much I miss this.

08:09.699 --> 08:11.659
You were never in the game.
You were a married doctor.

08:11.742 --> 08:13.244
Ah, whatever. Hey, do
you guys want a mint?

08:13.327 --> 08:14.370
Yeah.

08:14.495 --> 08:15.535
Here we go.
That's for you.

08:15.580 --> 08:16.581
That's for you.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.704
That's a weird mint, dude.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.458
Yeah, I know.
It's Viagra.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.878
You've got four hours to drink like
Keith Richards and still get hard.

08:21.961 --> 08:24.755
Every good action movie
has a ticking clock. Right?

08:25.631 --> 08:26.924
Fucking idiots.

08:27.425 --> 08:28.593
Idiots.

08:31.429 --> 08:32.722
I know!

08:33.264 --> 08:35.099
I'm fucking drunk right now.

08:35.183 --> 08:36.183
Yeah, that's right.

08:40.313 --> 08:41.688
I can't wait to get drunk.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.441
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.026
Hey, come here.
Yes, you can.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.652
Yes, you can.
You just need to be like,

08:46.777 --> 08:48.279
"Hey! I'm a
good-looking doctor."

08:48.362 --> 08:49.697
No, it would work for me, Mikey.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.032
Would it?
Yeah, it would.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.783
That would totally work for me.

08:54.035 --> 08:55.536
Hey! Chels!

08:55.620 --> 08:59.624
Oh, my God! I love yourshoes! I've
been looking for those.

08:59.707 --> 09:00.875
Oh, thank you!

09:00.958 --> 09:02.877
Wow! You are beautiful.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.546
Oh, this is my friend,
Daniel. He's amazing.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.423
But he's a virgin.

09:08.225 --> 09:09.985
- Oh, there's always a catch.
Mmm-hmm.

09:10.009 --> 09:13.221
I'm just trying to get laid
before I graduate high school.

09:13.304 --> 09:14.889
Hi, I'm Sophie.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.474
I know you are.

09:16.641 --> 09:18.226
<i>♪ I could use a break</i>

09:18.643 --> 09:22.647
<i>♪ Me need to go down, down,
down, down on life</i>

09:23.064 --> 09:26.234
<i>♪ I need you to
take all my shadows</i>

09:26.317 --> 09:27.526
Whiskey...
Yeah.

09:27.652 --> 09:29.453
I love you. We're doing it...
I love you, too.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.822
<i>♪ I could use a break</i>

09:32.406 --> 09:35.910
<i>♪ Me need to go down, down,
down, down on life</i>

09:36.494 --> 09:38.621
I've never met that guy before.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.208
<i>♪ All my shadows
for a walk tonight... 4“</i>

09:42.291 --> 09:44.585
What's up, buddy?
How's it going?

09:44.669 --> 09:45.670
Well,

09:45.753 --> 09:48.256
I'm drinking alone in
a bar full of assholes.

09:48.339 --> 09:50.758
And all these girls, they seem
to like the assholes more.

09:50.925 --> 09:53.761
Dude, do you remember when for,
like, two years in college,

09:53.844 --> 09:56.931
every single girl
that I liked liked you?

09:57.014 --> 09:58.015
Rebecca Daniels...

09:58.099 --> 09:59.100
Yeah. Rebecca Daniels.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.810
She was hot.
She was.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.311
She was all right.

10:02.395 --> 10:04.522
Where's the Mikey that got her?

10:05.690 --> 10:09.026
Because that guy
was fucking awesome.

10:12.363 --> 10:14.283
That girl's staring at you
at the end of the bar.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.075
Should I look?
No, not yet.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.159
Now.
No.

10:17.243 --> 10:18.286
Now.
No.

10:18.369 --> 10:19.620
Now.
No.

10:19.704 --> 10:21.330
Yeah, go ahead and look.

10:31.424 --> 10:32.842
Night away?

10:34.927 --> 10:36.762
Yeah. She was fucking Harold.

10:37.138 --> 10:38.806
There's always a Harold.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.309
There's always a Harold.

10:41.559 --> 10:42.685
Mmm.
Mmm.

10:42.768 --> 10:45.479
When I was a kid, I used to open
all the windows in my bedroom

10:45.563 --> 10:49.150
when it was freezing, and just
lay on top of the covers.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.651
Why?

10:50.735 --> 10:53.571
I wanted to understand what
it felt like to be homeless.

10:54.572 --> 10:56.574
Do you understand that feeling?

10:57.742 --> 10:59.910
Just needing to know?

11:01.370 --> 11:02.371
Wow.

11:02.455 --> 11:03.998
I know.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.167
He fucking looked
like Morris Chestnut.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.626
Who looks
like Morris Chestnut?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.795
It is not a good look. Nobody
should look like Morris Chestnut.

11:09.879 --> 11:12.131
Okay, who is Morris Chestnut?

11:12.214 --> 11:14.216
Apparently, he's a great lawyer.

11:16.761 --> 11:18.429
Well, I wrote my number on this.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.473
Use it when you're ready.

11:23.059 --> 11:24.620
Look, is this the part
where we go home?

11:24.685 --> 11:26.062
'Cause I'm not
really in the mood.

11:26.145 --> 11:28.272
You're sitting on my coat.

11:29.607 --> 11:30.775
Hmm.

11:32.068 --> 11:33.319
I am.

11:34.195 --> 11:35.196
I'm sorry about that.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.365
It's okay. Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

11:37.448 --> 11:39.283
Good night.
Good night.

11:43.245 --> 11:44.330
Hey.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.831
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want a drink?

11:45.915 --> 11:46.874
Oh, no. I'm good.
Let me get you a drink.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.209
What, a vodka soda?
No, no, no.

11:48.292 --> 11:49.585
My man.
No.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.836
Come on.
It's just a drink.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.088
Oh, no. I'm good.
Thank you.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.506
I need a drink, too.
I'll get you a drink.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.716
Honestly, what if
I enjoy the drink?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.385
What happens then?

11:57.468 --> 11:59.804
I'd love to hear what
you think happens then.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.431
I'll tell you what happens.

12:02.515 --> 12:04.934
We go play beer pong
with your two roommates

12:05.017 --> 12:07.269
until I end up back at
yours in Murray Hill?

12:07.353 --> 12:08.854
Yeah, that's right.
How did you know that?

12:08.938 --> 12:11.607
And then we'll have to listen to
your roommate have sex with Hilary

12:11.690 --> 12:14.735
or Emily or whatever the girl's
name is until we fall asleep.

12:14.819 --> 12:17.071
And then a year later, we're
still playing beer pong

12:17.154 --> 12:18.656
in the same bars
with your friends.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.409
Except now you feel pressure
to get married and have kids

12:21.492 --> 12:23.577
'cause you think
that's what I want.

12:23.661 --> 12:24.829
Then in the summers, drive up

12:24.912 --> 12:26.038
to the Hamptons
to meet his parents,

12:26.122 --> 12:28.499
wondering the whole ride if they're
going to think you're pretty enough.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.625
Smart.
Wondering the whole ride,

12:29.708 --> 12:30.876
if they're going to
think you're smart enough.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.254
Because no one is. And then we
have to drink shitty chardonnay.

12:33.337 --> 12:34.422
At a shitty garden party.

12:34.465 --> 12:35.665
And have shitty conversations.

12:35.673 --> 12:36.673
About shitty people.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.050
With his shitty mother.

12:38.134 --> 12:39.718
Who, let's face it, doesn't
think you're smart enough.

12:39.802 --> 12:40.802
Pretty.

12:40.845 --> 12:43.055
Who, let's face it, doesn't
think you're pretty enough.

12:43.139 --> 12:44.890
Because no one is.

12:44.974 --> 12:46.851
No one ever will be.

12:47.430 --> 12:49.830
What was all that shit? Look,
I'm just talking about a drink.

12:49.854 --> 12:53.774
Yeah, but it wasn't just
a drink, though, was it?

12:53.858 --> 12:55.526
It was a marriage proposal.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.154
Oh, marriage. No, I was...

12:58.612 --> 13:00.364
Just a vodka soda.

13:01.866 --> 13:03.075
Fuck you guys. I'm...

13:04.493 --> 13:05.744
Drink?
Yeah.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.215
You're amazing.

13:18.382 --> 13:20.092
Let's get out of here.

13:26.474 --> 13:27.975
You like that?

13:28.559 --> 13:31.228
You're sitting on my coat.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.571
l have to use your bathroom.

14:05.930 --> 14:06.931
Fuck. Pick up.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.390
Pick up. Pick up
your phone!

14:08.474 --> 14:09.725
Dude, I have a serious problem.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.394
<i>You got</i> a <i>problem. I got</i> a <i>problem.
I gotta take</i> a <i>leak right now.</i>

14:12.478 --> 14:14.719
<i>And my</i> boner <i>looks like that
thing on The Price ls Right.</i>

14:14.772 --> 14:15.773
Bob Barker?

14:15.856 --> 14:16.857
Yeah, my dick
looks like Bob Barker.

14:16.941 --> 14:19.068
No, you asshole, that thing
that stops the wheel.

14:19.151 --> 14:21.028
What? I think I took
too much Viagra.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.196
I just really
got to take a leak.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.074
You have to just get horizontal.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.909
Get horizontal?
What the...

14:26.992 --> 14:28.202
You need to be horizontal.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.204
Me or the boner?
Both.

14:30.287 --> 14:31.872
I can't. My boner is
perpendicular to my body.

14:31.956 --> 14:32.998
Just try it, man.

14:33.082 --> 14:35.543
<i>This is the stupidest idea I've
ever heard of. What the...</i>

14:35.626 --> 14:36.835
This isn't... Whoa!

14:36.919 --> 14:39.380
Wait, bro,
it's actually working.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.881
Of course it is,
but, dude, listen to me.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.842
I think the girl that I just
had sex with is a hooker.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.010
What? That's awesome.

14:45.094 --> 14:47.596
No! It's not awesome, man.
What if she makes me pay?

14:47.680 --> 14:48.764
I don't have hooker money.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.349
You definitely don't
have hooker money. Dude.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.976
I don't know what to do,
man. You gotta help me.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.686
Okay, well, you know what?
If she asks for cash,

14:53.769 --> 14:55.312
you could pretend that
you're a hooker, too,

14:55.479 --> 14:57.022
and maybe the rates
would balance out.

14:57.106 --> 14:59.066
You are so fucking useless.
Do you know that?

14:59.149 --> 15:00.429
Is your dick touching the water?

15:00.818 --> 15:01.819
Fuck you.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.333
Which one of you
divas uses self-tanner?

15:17.001 --> 15:18.669
I do. Why?

15:20.129 --> 15:21.609
Because I beat off
with it last night.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.758
Why... Why didn't you
even read the bottle?

15:24.842 --> 15:25.884
I was a little drunk.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.344
What?
What?

15:27.428 --> 15:28.971
- My shit is orange.
- Oh!

15:29.555 --> 15:31.515
Oh, my God.Look at this!

15:31.599 --> 15:32.600
Oh, no.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.310
Who knew that could
even happen to you?

15:36.061 --> 15:38.147
I didn't know you
could change colors.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.940
Stop.
Your dick looks like a yam.

15:40.035 --> 15:41.876
Your dick looks like a traffic cone.
Just stop.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.236
Your dick looks like
a can of cheddar Pringles.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.320
That's fucked up.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.989
You dick looks like
Spike Lee at a Knicks game.

15:47.072 --> 15:50.242
If your dick was jumping over the
river, it would be the General Lee.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.053
All right! All right! What happened
to you two idiots last night?

15:54.121 --> 15:55.539
I freaked out and left. I
didn't know what to do.

15:55.623 --> 15:57.374
It's her bread and butter. It's
how she keeps the lights on.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.459
You basically robbed a hooker.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.127
I didn't rob her.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.295
Yes, you did. You
robbed this hooker, man.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.546
You're like the opposite
of Robin Hood.

16:02.630 --> 16:04.298
I didn't rob her. And
that's the thing. I mean,

16:04.381 --> 16:06.050
everything else
about her was perfect.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.801
I mean, she was smart.
She was funny.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.928
She was the kind of
girl I would date.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.806
If she didn't, you know, happen
to fuck random guys for money.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.642
Yeah. That's
really the only thing

16:14.725 --> 16:16.143
that's getting in the way
of that relationship.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.353
Fuck you guys.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.271
Did you friend that girl yet, Mikey?
The glasses girl?

16:19.396 --> 16:21.076
No. I mean, can you
even do that that fast?

16:21.273 --> 16:22.941
Dude! You've gotta make her laugh.
Get a rapport going.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.068
Yeah, man. Give me
your phone real quick.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.153
Give him your phone. We live in
an extremely efficient world.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.988
Somebody else could be
sealing the deal right now.

16:28.072 --> 16:31.492
Listen,  last night was amazing.
Okay? I had a great time.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.077
You guys were awesome.
Thank you.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.995
All right?
But I'm gonna call Vera.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.914
We've got things
that we need to work on.

16:37.081 --> 16:38.332
No. That's a bad move.
Come on.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.500
You don't wanna do that.
Horrible move.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.983
We had so much fun last night.
Yeah.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.043
Wow.

16:42.086 --> 16:43.337
What?

16:43.420 --> 16:44.421
Uh, she“.

16:45.798 --> 16:47.007
She changed it.

16:47.091 --> 16:48.217
BOTH; What?

16:48.300 --> 16:49.468
What are you talking about?

16:51.637 --> 16:53.722
Uh, Vera.

16:53.806 --> 16:56.058
It used to say, "married,"
and now it says...

16:58.060 --> 16:59.478
It says nothing.

17:03.232 --> 17:04.775
All right,
I married a smart girl.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.443
I married the right girl.
Right?

17:06.527 --> 17:08.569
I went to med school
right after college.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.698
I did what I was supposed to do.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.702
I checked the boxes.

17:17.636 --> 17:19.516
But maybe what you
did didn't check hers.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.999
We had
the same boxes.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.501
Did you have
the same boxes?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.044
Maybe you need a little
more experience with boxes.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.171
Yeah, maybe we should lead you
down the path to better boxes.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.631
Look, guys. I don't need that.
All right?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.795
I need to call Vera and I
need to work this shit out.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.218
That's what I'm going to do.
I need to call her, okay?

17:31.301 --> 17:33.095
I need to call Vera. I need
to work this shit out.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.458
It kills me to
see you like this.

17:34.471 --> 17:35.639
Yeah.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.599
Hey.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.685
It's an opportunity
to have some fun.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.270
Man, this is about
all of us, man.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.915
This is about all
of us being together.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.481
When are we all
gonna be unattached?

17:44.565 --> 17:46.400
In our 30s we're gonna
settle down with kids.

17:46.483 --> 17:48.861
We're gonna live a boring life.
It's about us right now.

17:49.987 --> 17:50.988
I don't know.

17:51.155 --> 17:52.990
We're staying single with you, man.
I just don't know.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.450
We're staying single with you.

17:55.534 --> 17:58.537
We're gonna keep last night alive
as long as humanly possible.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.038
Nobody gets in a relationship.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.915
Nobody changes their status.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.626
Right?

18:07.171 --> 18:08.171
I'm in.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.339
I'm in.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.635
Come on!
Come on!

18:13.719 --> 18:15.095
Come on!
Come on!

18:15.679 --> 18:18.348
Michael? Are you in?

18:21.018 --> 18:22.227
Fuck it. I'm in.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.527
So, we going for this?
Yeah.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.074
I mean, it's a pretty
bleak ending to a book,

18:36.158 --> 18:38.494
so shouldn't we leave people
with some hope?

18:38.577 --> 18:40.746
From where in the Midwest
did this one wash up?

18:40.829 --> 18:42.664
Fresh off her master's
from Chicago.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.833
Master's in what?
Sentimentality?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.710
I don't think so.

18:47.211 --> 18:49.671
I just think you have to
believe in possibility.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.548
Oh, sweetie. Welcome
to New York.

18:51.632 --> 18:54.384
You're young and you're pretty
and the world is yours.

18:56.011 --> 18:57.971
But you're nobody's
first wife yet.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.683
Well, we're all pretty...

19:01.767 --> 19:03.393
Oh! Oh, look who's here.
Hi.

19:03.477 --> 19:04.637
Glad you could make it.

19:04.686 --> 19:05.729
Yeah.

19:05.813 --> 19:08.690
I gotta tell you I'm really
excited about this cover, guys.

19:08.774 --> 19:09.983
Hey.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.610
Here you go.
Okay.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.320
Hey-

19:13.403 --> 19:15.072
Holy shit.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.744
Everyone. How's it going?

19:21.078 --> 19:22.371
Good, good.

19:23.372 --> 19:24.581
Uh...

19:29.378 --> 19:31.588
So, do you want to
tell us a little bit

19:31.713 --> 19:33.924
about your approach
with this cover?

19:39.137 --> 19:41.807
Yeah. I'd love
a little explanation.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.103
Um...

19:49.273 --> 19:50.691
It...

19:50.774 --> 19:52.693
It is what it is.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.111
"It is what it is"?

19:54.194 --> 19:56.238
That's what you say when
you get a parking ticket.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.447
I know.

19:57.531 --> 20:00.200
It looks to me like the
guy here wants to escape.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.286
Hmm. Does he?

20:02.953 --> 20:06.456
And we want him to stay.
That's the fantasy of men in the city.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.876
It seems like she'll bring
him home in the bag,

20:08.959 --> 20:11.837
totally trusting him and then
after they sleep together,

20:11.920 --> 20:13.797
he'll prove to be
too much of an asshole

20:13.881 --> 20:16.383
to actually stick around
for a couple of hours.

20:17.718 --> 20:22.139
So tell me, Jason.
Why wouldn't the guy stay?

20:23.265 --> 20:24.433
Hmm?

20:24.766 --> 20:26.435
I thought you were a hooker.

20:27.978 --> 20:28.979
What?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.063
A hooker.

20:30.147 --> 20:31.148
Why?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.232
There were hooker signs.

20:32.316 --> 20:33.358
What's a hooker sign?

20:33.442 --> 20:35.027
You had on hooker boots.
Lots of people have them.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.069
There were tons of condoms.

20:36.153 --> 20:37.195
Did you ever think
they might be there

20:37.279 --> 20:38.363
because I'm not
having a ton of sex?

20:38.447 --> 20:39.948
No! I thought they
were a hooker sign!

20:40.032 --> 20:41.074
What's a hooker sign?

20:41.158 --> 20:42.618
<i>What about The Story of O?</i>

20:42.701 --> 20:44.244
That was research for a book.

20:44.328 --> 20:45.746
There were
envelopes full of cash.

20:45.829 --> 20:49.499
I pay my landlord in cash so
that he can commit tax fraud.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.835
How long have you
lived in New York?

20:52.836 --> 20:54.254
Man, not long enough.

20:54.338 --> 20:55.756
Yeah.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.799
Wait. Can I make it
up to you?

20:58.258 --> 20:59.718
Let me make it up to you.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.013
You wanna make it up to me?

21:04.264 --> 21:05.307
Can I?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.562
I don't know.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.859
You can have my number.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.528
And...

21:19.196 --> 21:21.365
Maybe you can.

21:39.841 --> 21:42.594
Yeah, dude. Everybody knows you
can't call a girl a hooker.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.198
Even hookers hate
being called hookers.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.681
I'm gonna bring Ellie around.

21:45.764 --> 21:47.849
No, you're not!
No, you're not.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.017
I'm gonna get her on the roster.

21:49.101 --> 21:50.185
Wait. A roster?

21:50.268 --> 21:51.269
Yeah. A roster.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.521
It's a group of girls
that you're hooking up with

21:52.604 --> 21:53.855
that keeps you from sending
the wrong message.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.649
Which is what? That you
wanna date one of them.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.234
You gotta start
building a roster.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.652
Yeah. It'll help ease
the transition a little.

21:58.735 --> 21:59.778
No, no. I do not need a roster.
Okay?

21:59.861 --> 22:00.861
Yes, you do.

22:00.904 --> 22:01.989
I can't keep one girl.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.240
What makes you think I can
handle a bunch of them?

22:03.323 --> 22:04.950
You just keep a bunch of them
for a short period of time

22:05.033 --> 22:06.535
and then you send them out
into the world to flourish.

22:06.618 --> 22:07.786
Like college kids.
Yes.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.121
Or like capitalism.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.497
And then you replenish the team.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.041
Think of a roster like a
spiritual and physical...

22:13.125 --> 22:14.209
Mostly physical.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.836
Rejuvenation of the male soul.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.559
Which you guys clearly
don't fucking have.

22:17.629 --> 22:18.797
Think of it like a spa.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.215
A spa for your cock.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.009
A cock spa.
Yep.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.552
You just got to
use whatever skills

22:23.677 --> 22:25.137
that you have available to you.
Mmm.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.930
Girls love personalization.

22:27.014 --> 22:28.015
You guys are idiots.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.099
You're an idiot.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.521
Vera!

22:35.731 --> 22:37.691
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
to barge in on you.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.109
What are you doing here?

22:40.569 --> 22:41.820
Okay, look.

22:42.946 --> 22:46.158
I know that this is an
awkward thing to do, but...

22:48.201 --> 22:49.327
Um...

22:50.454 --> 22:53.874
I have been having some pain.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.793
And, um, I just...

22:58.920 --> 23:00.589
I don't know.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.883
You came because
you needed my help.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.593
I came to apologize.
I did.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.386
You came because you needed my help.
Mikey.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.725
I just... I've been
thinking about you.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.946
It really was just
a simple misunderstanding.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.280
Yeah, it was like, "What
kind of girl would I be

24:07.364 --> 24:09.116
"if I didn't eventually
find it funny?"

24:09.199 --> 24:12.702
You'd be probably every other
girl in the world. I think.

24:14.704 --> 24:15.831
I'm really sorry.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.625
But I'm not every
other girl in the world.

24:18.708 --> 24:19.793
No.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.169
I guess you're not.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.839
And then I kind of developed
my own style, I guess.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.465
And now you...

24:25.549 --> 24:27.175
Design book covers.

24:27.259 --> 24:28.677
Amongst other things.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.971
Well, I guess you get people
to believe in something enough

24:31.054 --> 24:32.305
to want to buy it.

24:32.389 --> 24:34.641
I get people to
believe in the surface.

24:34.724 --> 24:37.602
To do the one thing your
parents told you not to do.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.604
To judge a book by its cover.

24:39.729 --> 24:40.856
Exactly.

24:41.347 --> 24:42.708
Oh, we weren't
supposed to do that.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.012
You weren't supposed to do that.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.069
See? I was encouraged.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.655
Another example of
just plain awful parenting.

24:50.907 --> 24:53.451
But, like, the job
that you have right now,

24:53.535 --> 24:55.776
like, is it something that you
actually want to be doing?

24:56.079 --> 24:57.831
You know what?
It can be fun.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.583
But do I love it?

24:59.666 --> 25:00.876
You don't.
No.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.627
Don't you want
to love something?

25:04.588 --> 25:06.590
What? Do you love
what you do?

25:06.673 --> 25:08.758
I started this
new lecture series.

25:08.842 --> 25:11.282
And authors can come along and
they can talk about their work.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.504
That's awesome.
Yes. So great.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.014
And people come?
No.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.599
No?
No.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.309
But I...

25:17.392 --> 25:19.936
It's okay. I mean, I figure
that if I keep doing It,

25:20.020 --> 25:21.771
it could be a really,
really amazing thing.

25:24.482 --> 25:27.944
You should come along to one
of them if you're around.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.029
Oh, I don't know.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.448
I can't really tell if
it's important to you.

25:35.952 --> 25:38.330
I'm sorry.
That's a weird laugh.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.797
This is my favorite
place in the city.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.008
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

25:51.551 --> 25:55.847
I know that I'm
romanticizing the idea,

25:57.307 --> 25:58.642
but come on.

25:59.351 --> 26:03.271
That's kind of my dream. To
have the key to Gramercy Park.

26:05.148 --> 26:08.902
New York's charm is you're
surrounded by things you can't have.

26:09.945 --> 26:14.032
New York's charm is it makes
you think you can have them.

26:20.205 --> 26:25.252
You know, I'd love to look
inside before we buy.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.295
Me, too.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.423
In the meantime,
we can go back to my place.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.717
It's very similar, actually.

26:32.801 --> 26:35.845
Except for everything about it.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.348
I gotta get home.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.808
Okay. Yours, it is.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.463
You're one hell of a negotiator.

26:41.518 --> 26:45.105
This kind of stuff just rolls
off your tongue doesn't it?

26:45.188 --> 26:47.399
I'm just trying
to make you laugh.

26:58.702 --> 27:01.246
I don't like how
well it's working.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.795
Fuck...

27:12.499 --> 27:14.819
Wait, so you guys still
haven't gotten Mikey laid?

27:14.843 --> 27:15.843
No.
What's wrong with you?

27:15.885 --> 27:16.886
You're like
the worst wingman ever.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.805
Are you kidding me, Chelsea?
I'm an incredible wingman.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.015
I know, but, like, nothing?

27:20.098 --> 27:21.141
It's just harder
than you think with him.

27:21.224 --> 27:22.183
Like, what about a blowjob?

27:22.267 --> 27:23.601
I'm good right now,
but thank you.

27:23.685 --> 27:24.936
Uh-huh.
Maybe in, like, 10 minutes?

27:25.020 --> 27:26.020
Maybe after this beer?

27:26.062 --> 27:27.063
Sorry, I'm just
making a mental list

27:27.147 --> 27:29.024
of all the things I'd like to
do before giving you a blowjob.

27:29.107 --> 27:30.358
Wow. Really?

27:30.442 --> 27:32.861
Oh! Kill myself
is number one.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.612
Are you serious?
Jesus. What's number two?

27:34.863 --> 27:37.198
Uh... Just, like,
awaiting trial in Guantanamo.

27:37.282 --> 27:38.825
Mmm-hmm? Yup.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

27:38.908 --> 27:42.203
Oh, come on, man. The blues?
Are you fucking serious?

27:42.287 --> 27:45.999
What the fuck does Captain
Attractive have to be so sad about?

27:46.082 --> 27:47.500
I don't know.

27:47.584 --> 27:52.213
I think he's going for
brooding and dark, mysterious.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.418
It's kind of working for me.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.632
That is working?
Yes.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.236
You cannot be that attractive and
have a skill. That's bullshit.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.095
Well, I'm gonna play,
so you're wrong.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.056
Ooh, then somebody's in trouble.

28:01.139 --> 28:03.141
Cheer up, asshole.
You're the guy.

28:04.309 --> 28:05.518
Buckle up.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.437
Hey, excuse me? I just wanted
to tell you great job.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.938
I almost cried right there.

28:09.147 --> 28:10.648
It was really
some powerful stuff.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.609
Yeah. It was brooding, dark,
and mysterious, apparently.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.444
Yeah. Thanks. That's
what I was going for.

28:14.694 --> 28:15.862
Told you.

28:15.945 --> 28:16.905
This is my friend, Chelsea.

28:16.988 --> 28:19.574
She's not much to look at, but wait
till you hear her play the piano.

28:19.657 --> 28:20.784
Really good.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.035
I can't wait. I'm Diego.

28:22.869 --> 28:23.870
I know you are.

28:23.953 --> 28:26.581
I warn you, though. She can be
really aggressive sometimes.

28:26.664 --> 28:27.707
Is that right?

28:27.791 --> 28:29.918
But you can tame her with
tequila and compliments.

28:30.001 --> 28:31.044
Yeah.
So...

28:31.127 --> 28:32.587
Super aggressive.
Oh, yeah?

28:32.670 --> 28:33.755
Hey, are you home?

28:33.838 --> 28:35.215
<i>No. I'm at the hospital.
Where are you?</i>

28:35.298 --> 28:36.466
I'm headed back.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.717
<i>All right. So?</i>

28:37.801 --> 28:38.801
How was it?

28:38.843 --> 28:40.887
It was amazing, man.
She was amazing.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.650
So is she coming back
to the house or what?

28:43.390 --> 28:44.724
Not exactly.

28:48.895 --> 28:54.526
<i>♪ Now listen, honey, while I say</i>

28:56.236 --> 29:01.699
<i>♪ How can you fix your mind
to say you're going away?</i>

29:04.035 --> 29:06.454
♪ Don't say that we must part

29:11.126 --> 29:15.630
<i>♪ Don't break my aching heart</i>

29:18.550 --> 29:21.469
<i>♪ You know you love me...</i>

29:23.805 --> 29:25.098
Hey.

29:25.223 --> 29:26.516
After midnight? Really?

29:26.683 --> 29:28.268
I couldn't sleep.
Hmm.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.689
It's good to see you.

29:33.690 --> 29:37.277
<i>♪ How can you leave me?</i>

29:40.822 --> 29:44.409
<i>♪ Listen while I say</i>

29:48.538 --> 29:50.582
<i>♪ After you've gone</i>

29:52.250 --> 29:55.462
<i>♪ After you've gone away S'</i>

30:06.473 --> 30:08.766
So what happened with you
and the piano man? Rodrigo?

30:08.850 --> 30:10.351
Diego?
Diego.

30:10.435 --> 30:11.478
I don't know.

30:11.561 --> 30:13.354
I don't want to date a guy that's
prettier than me. You know?

30:13.438 --> 30:15.064
Yeah. Me neither.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.399
Plus, he works out.

30:16.483 --> 30:17.804
I don't want a man
that works out.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.570
Yeah. I worked out
once. 2004.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.447
Got on the 15 dumbbells.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.449
I was like, "Those are way too
light, let me go to the 30s."

30:24.532 --> 30:25.572
Nice.
And if you feel it...

30:25.575 --> 30:26.618
Don't. I don't
wanna touch it.

30:26.701 --> 30:27.827
And then I hit the hammies.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.245
Some quads.
And if you feel that.

30:29.370 --> 30:30.691
You definitely
got the lingo down.

30:30.747 --> 30:31.789
Do you see that?
No.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.291
Ah, well...
Fat.

30:33.374 --> 30:35.793
That's what happens
when you work out

30:35.877 --> 30:37.420
Once.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.381
What are you doing here anyway?

30:40.465 --> 30:41.549
What do you mean?
I don't know.

30:41.633 --> 30:44.093
Weren't you supposed to hang out
with that girl from Trinity?

30:44.219 --> 30:49.432
Oh, yeah. I had to tell her I wasn't
looking for anything too serious.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.601
Oh. 'Cause if it ever
stopped being fun for you

30:51.726 --> 30:53.603
guys, you'd want
to just call it off?

30:53.686 --> 30:55.021
That's... Yeah.
I know.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.105
You got it down.

30:56.189 --> 30:57.190
Brother. I know the spiel.
Brother.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.525
Yeah.

30:58.656 --> 31:00.336
I don't know. I just
thought you liked her.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.444
I did like her.

31:01.528 --> 31:04.072
She was cool, really smart,
funny, well-read.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.865
Great family.
Love it

31:05.949 --> 31:07.867
And gave the best blowjob
in recorded history.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.452
I feel like every
blowjob you get,

31:09.619 --> 31:11.120
you think is the best
in recorded history...

31:11.204 --> 31:12.997
Well, if you look at
the common variable

31:13.122 --> 31:15.002
across all encounters,
you'll find that it's me.

31:15.041 --> 31:18.294
So maybe I'm the best in recorded
history at receiving blowjobs.

31:18.378 --> 31:19.587
Barn.
Barn.

31:19.671 --> 31:21.214
Think about that.
Don't want to.

31:21.297 --> 31:24.551
Cheers to me getting awesome
blowjobs and just being good at it.

31:24.634 --> 31:25.760
You're such an idiot.
Oh!

31:25.843 --> 31:26.886
Oh.

32:03.881 --> 32:07.093
So? Jason, where
is this going?

32:08.177 --> 32:09.262
Fuck.

32:09.345 --> 32:10.555
Um...

32:11.431 --> 32:15.351
Look, I think
you're an amazing girl.

32:16.603 --> 32:19.480
And if I was in
a different place, maybe,

32:19.564 --> 32:21.065
but, I mean,
you know that I'm not

32:21.190 --> 32:22.734
really looking for
anything serious.

32:22.817 --> 32:26.070
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. As soon as this
stops being fun for one of us.

32:36.289 --> 32:37.850
Hey, J-Go! How'd it
go with that hooker?

32:37.874 --> 32:39.000
Oh!

32:40.043 --> 32:41.461
Did you just call me a hooker?

32:41.544 --> 32:43.296
No, I meant
the other... Um...

32:44.553 --> 32:46.233
Yeah. I just said
the wrong thing just now.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.508
You think?

32:47.634 --> 32:49.344
Yes.

32:50.386 --> 32:51.971
Hey, Mikey?

32:54.932 --> 32:55.933
Mikey?
Mmm?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.935
Can you shut the door?
Oh, shit.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.317
Okay. I'd like to
apologize.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.401
Don't worry about it.

33:05.568 --> 33:06.611
Caffeine?

33:07.278 --> 33:09.280
No, thanks. I gotta run.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.908
But at least he offers.

33:11.991 --> 33:12.992
I offer.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.077
You've never offered.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.995
For the record. I'm
sorry for anything I said.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.498
Am saying. And might
say in the future.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.750
An apology. So sweet.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.835
I like him better than you.
For the record.

33:22.919 --> 33:24.921
For the record,
he is better than me.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.339
Ha!
This is true.

33:26.422 --> 33:27.632
Bye.

33:30.635 --> 33:32.178
So you went outwith...
Ellie.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.262
Then you came home
and had sex with...

33:33.429 --> 33:34.472
Alana.

33:34.555 --> 33:35.723
Jesus!

33:35.807 --> 33:37.558
I did that for you.
You did it for me?

33:37.684 --> 33:39.352
Yeah. You had sex with a
beautiful woman for me?

33:39.435 --> 33:40.436
Yeah. For you.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.771
Thank you. Thank you.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.273
If I need anything else, I'll
be sure to let you know.

33:44.357 --> 33:45.650
I'm just building
my roster, man.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.151
Roster?
Yeah, my roster.

33:47.235 --> 33:48.235
Ellie's on the way in.

33:48.277 --> 33:49.612
Alana just gave me
the "so."

33:49.696 --> 33:50.822
The "so"?

33:50.905 --> 33:51.905
Yeah, the "so."

33:51.948 --> 33:55.076
When it comes to girls, nothing
good ever follows the word "so."

33:55.159 --> 33:56.911
"So," where is this going?

33:56.994 --> 33:58.496
"So," what're we doing?

33:58.579 --> 33:59.706
And you just got the "so"?

33:59.789 --> 34:01.249
Yeah, I just got the "so."

34:01.332 --> 34:02.709
So that's when you get out.

34:02.792 --> 34:03.793
Always?

34:03.918 --> 34:04.961
Always.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.096
You're a fucking idiot.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.060
So Chelsea worked
her magic again?

34:21.143 --> 34:23.103
Yeah, yeah. In a sense, yeah.
Really?

34:23.187 --> 34:24.938
So, is she, like, hot.
She smart, cool?

34:25.022 --> 34:26.649
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
all of the above.

34:26.733 --> 34:27.900
Wow, really?

34:27.984 --> 34:29.277
Yeah. I'm not
gonna date her.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.237
She's not datable if that's
what you're getting at, okay?

34:31.320 --> 34:33.030
So let's just calm down.

34:33.330 --> 34:35.050
What about you? Did you
see what's-her-name?

34:35.074 --> 34:36.117
Ellie?
Oh, yeah.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.001
Yeah. We, like, went to the park.
We hung out.

34:38.077 --> 34:39.245
Went to the park, hung out?

34:39.328 --> 34:41.246
You liked this girl when you
thought she was a hooker.

34:42.415 --> 34:43.916
Are you falling in love?
No, man.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.085
I think you are. I can
hear it in your voice.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.754
I had sex with Alana.

34:47.837 --> 34:49.338
You had sex with both of them?
No.

34:49.422 --> 34:50.882
You fucking double gophered?

34:50.965 --> 34:52.300
I didn't.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.260
You double gophered?
I love that.

34:54.342 --> 34:55.762
You had sex with both of them.
That's awesome.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.181
No, I didn't. Ellie went home.
Alana came over.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.424
That's what I love about you.

34:59.474 --> 35:00.674
Like, you never push too hard.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.059
You always have a backup.
Yeah.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.187
<i>You're like</i> Judge <i>Reinhold
in Beverly Hills Cop.</i>

35:04.270 --> 35:05.396
I'm not getting
in a relationship.

35:05.521 --> 35:06.842
Except you're an asshole.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.657
Hello. This is Ellie.

35:16.741 --> 35:17.825
Hey.

35:17.909 --> 35:19.160
<i>It's Jason.</i>

35:19.243 --> 35:20.995
<i>All right, we're going
on a date tomorrow.</i>

35:21.078 --> 35:23.539
<i>Gramercy Park.
Dress nicely.</i>

35:23.623 --> 35:24.832
<i>No questions.</i>

35:25.249 --> 35:26.542
<i>You in?</i>

35:30.671 --> 35:31.672
Yeah.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.090
Vera, we have to talk.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.884
Mikey, did you call
the glasses girl, yet?

35:34.967 --> 35:37.303
Can you come see me
tonight? It's important.

35:37.386 --> 35:38.930
Dude. Tell us
how the call went.

35:39.013 --> 35:40.723
Nope. I'm not pissing.
Okay.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.099
Come on in.
First of all,

35:42.183 --> 35:43.434
your dick looks like it found Nemo.
Stop.

35:43.518 --> 35:45.319
Second of all, are you
gonna see glasses girl?

35:45.353 --> 35:46.354
She gonna come see me tonight.

35:46.437 --> 35:50.107
First of all, I think your click
looks like a snowman's nose.

35:50.191 --> 35:51.734
Can you stop?
Second of all,

35:51.776 --> 35:52.944
Mmm-hmm. l thought you
worked tonight?

35:53.027 --> 35:54.388
She might come by the hospital.
No.

35:54.445 --> 35:56.322
Mikey, I love your
thinking on this, man.

35:56.405 --> 35:57.824
The work-date combination.

35:57.907 --> 35:58.991
It's very impressive.
Yeah.

35:59.075 --> 36:00.076
I'm just thinking on my toes.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.199
He knows shit, man.

36:01.244 --> 36:03.079
It's casual.
Lt's innovative.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.789
Mmm.
I love your work, man.

36:04.872 --> 36:07.625
I love that jacket.
Where are you going tonight?

36:07.708 --> 36:08.793
I have a pretty big
night ahead of me.

36:08.876 --> 36:12.004
I'm playing the incredibly
wealthy Mr. Von Ferrington.

36:12.088 --> 36:13.548
That's so awesome!

36:13.631 --> 36:14.966
You're role playing.
You're committing.

36:15.049 --> 36:16.130
Exactly. What
are you doing?

36:16.133 --> 36:17.134
I'm going to
meet up with Chelsea

36:17.218 --> 36:18.177
and see what we can make happen.

36:18.261 --> 36:19.262
Again?

36:19.345 --> 36:20.429
Why is she always hooking
you up with girls?

36:20.513 --> 36:21.889
Have you looked in the mirror?
Have you looked at me?

36:21.973 --> 36:23.599
I'm the most attractive.
So it's the easiest.

36:23.724 --> 36:25.142
Come on.
Yeah! That's why.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.603
Guys, in high school, I was voted
most likely to have the best eyes.

36:27.687 --> 36:29.313
That's just not true.
So...

36:29.397 --> 36:30.398
Yeah, right.

36:31.107 --> 36:32.400
You idiot.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.492
Do you know that
James Harper lived here?

36:41.576 --> 36:43.576
Really? He used to
be the mayor of New York.

36:44.495 --> 36:47.540
You've really chosen a wonderful
property to look at Mr. Von...

36:47.623 --> 36:48.666
Ferrington.
Ferrington.

36:48.749 --> 36:50.376
Von Ferrington.
Von Ferrington.

36:50.459 --> 36:53.796
I mean, this is one of the
finest properties in the city.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.882
Thank you.
You're welcome.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.304
Look at the parquet floors that
are all inlaid and original.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.847
And this.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.974
Let me show you this.

37:07.184 --> 37:10.396
Unfettered access
to the private park

37:10.479 --> 37:13.566
is, of course, one of the finest
things about living on Gramercy.

37:13.649 --> 37:14.817
Unfettered?

37:14.984 --> 37:16.110
Unfettered.

37:17.653 --> 37:21.741
And now further, I'd like you to
take a look at this wrought iron.

37:21.824 --> 37:23.159
Lattice wrought iron
which is the original.

37:23.326 --> 37:24.702
Original?

37:24.785 --> 37:26.454
And we have in here a beautiful,

37:26.579 --> 37:28.205
beautiful, beautiful chandelier,

37:28.289 --> 37:29.749
which is cut crystal.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.752
You'll notice all of the
detail on the ceiling.

37:32.835 --> 37:36.589
Now the Obasan rug is
original of the period.

37:36.672 --> 37:39.467
And we have over there
a stained glass window.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.345
Let's go.
Why?

37:42.887 --> 37:44.931
Look at the detail
on this poster here.

37:45.014 --> 37:47.892
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
I'll explain later.

37:47.975 --> 37:50.061
Oh, here, the kitchen.

37:50.144 --> 37:51.687
Quick! The old
woman's coming!

37:52.772 --> 37:54.023
Hello?

37:54.857 --> 37:55.900
Won't we get caught?

37:55.983 --> 37:57.485
I don't think so.
Let's go.

37:57.568 --> 37:58.903
Hello?

37:58.986 --> 38:00.905
Mr. Ferrington?

38:00.988 --> 38:01.989
Hello?

38:03.407 --> 38:05.407
Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down.
Just walk normal.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.535
What do you mean walk...

38:06.577 --> 38:08.496
You're walking like a criminal.
What? This is how I walk.

38:08.579 --> 38:09.622
I'm not a criminal.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.248
But I am.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.460
We have to go. Let's go!

38:14.543 --> 38:15.920
Hello?

38:16.712 --> 38:17.713
Hello?

38:20.132 --> 38:22.635
Okay. You said
we need to talk.

38:22.718 --> 38:23.719
Nobody says, "We need to talk,"

38:23.886 --> 38:24.887
unless it's
really bad news, right?

38:24.971 --> 38:25.972
No, no, no.

38:26.097 --> 38:27.098
And my grandmother
had ovarian cancer.

38:27.181 --> 38:29.141
No, no, no. You're fine,
you're fine, you're fine!

38:29.225 --> 38:31.310
The tests they ran indicated
nothing out of the ordinary.

38:31.394 --> 38:32.520
I have all the symptoms.
Baby, you're fine.

38:32.603 --> 38:33.646
You're fine. You're okay.

38:33.729 --> 38:34.689
Come here.
What was that message then?

38:34.772 --> 38:36.399
Come here. No, no.
Come here.

38:36.524 --> 38:39.068
Okay. I am sorry.
I just wanted to talk.

38:39.527 --> 38:41.529
Oh, my God.
You are such an idiot.

38:41.988 --> 38:43.114
You are such an idiot.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.365
Yes.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.617
Just... Just...
Just come sit down. Okay?

38:48.703 --> 38:50.079
Oh, God.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.290
Breathe. Breathe.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.418
Oh, God, I thought I was dying.

39:01.007 --> 39:03.342
Yeah. You thought
you were dying.

39:03.426 --> 39:04.760
That was me.

39:12.893 --> 39:14.353
Where did we go wrong?

39:15.354 --> 39:19.066
Like, what happened?

39:19.191 --> 39:20.192
What happened to us?

39:22.403 --> 39:23.821
What happened? I...

39:25.531 --> 39:27.241
I mean, we got
married at 23 years old,

39:27.324 --> 39:30.327
I just don't think at that
point you are ready for a life

39:30.411 --> 39:32.788
without excitement
or spontaneity.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.540
Spontaneity?

39:34.915 --> 39:36.000
I mean, I'm spontaneous.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.047
We didn't have sex
for almost six months.

39:41.714 --> 39:43.257
You want spontaneous?

39:52.433 --> 39:53.433
Hey.
Hi.

39:53.476 --> 39:55.061
Are you sick or something?
No.

39:55.144 --> 39:56.562
Those aren't going out clothes.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.022
Well, who's going out?

39:58.105 --> 39:59.899
I thought we were going out.

40:01.650 --> 40:02.902
Oh!

40:03.986 --> 40:05.988
That was pretty badass.
Mmm-hmm.

40:06.072 --> 40:07.656
I can get fired for that shit.

40:36.268 --> 40:40.106
You know, when I was a kid, I
used to love going to parks.

40:40.189 --> 40:45.152
And my grandfather
used to take me every Sunday.

40:46.362 --> 40:48.197
But my ex hated parks.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.909
He thought they were
like too public or something.

40:51.992 --> 40:53.869
He sounds like a real dick.

40:53.953 --> 40:55.121
What? My ex?

40:55.204 --> 40:56.413
Your grandfather.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.459
So what happened
between the two of you?

41:02.253 --> 41:04.630
Well, I graduated from school
and I moved to New York.

41:04.713 --> 41:07.133
And he took a job in Chicago.

41:07.216 --> 41:12.805
And it was sort of like a
focus-on-your-work-life-first sort of thing.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.474
They call us
the selfish generation.

41:18.352 --> 41:19.812
What about you?

41:22.523 --> 41:25.860
Who's the one that got you?

41:27.736 --> 41:29.655
How dare you assume that I have

41:29.780 --> 41:31.657
any emotional
capacity whatsoever?

41:31.740 --> 41:33.242
Get out of my park.
No.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.869
Get out.
No.

41:35.744 --> 41:37.872
It's okay.
You can come back.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.385
Damn it!

41:51.844 --> 41:53.179
I was so not gonna do that.

41:53.262 --> 41:54.430
I was gonna hold out.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.849
I was gonna make you wait,
like, 40 days or something.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.185
I was gonna make you wait, too,

41:59.310 --> 42:01.604
but then I realized,
"I'm a dude."

42:17.578 --> 42:19.747
Hey, guys. It's Fred.

42:20.873 --> 42:23.876
Jesus! Fred, you're like
Reverse Elvis, you know.

42:23.959 --> 42:25.377
Fred, you entered the building.

42:26.629 --> 42:28.130
I love Elvis.

42:32.134 --> 42:33.802
"Thank you, very much."

42:36.805 --> 42:37.890
What's up, Fred?

42:37.973 --> 42:42.061
Well, Ellie from Simon just sent
over the Matterhorn book cover.

42:43.187 --> 42:44.230
And she wants us to do it?

42:44.313 --> 42:45.522
Specifically.

42:45.606 --> 42:46.649
Specifically?

42:46.815 --> 42:47.858
- Specifically.
- Whoo!

42:50.402 --> 42:52.112
I'll get in on that.

42:53.948 --> 42:55.199
Right.

42:59.787 --> 43:00.996
Come on.

43:02.414 --> 43:03.582
Thanks, Fred.
Yeah.

43:03.666 --> 43:04.667
All right.

43:04.750 --> 43:05.876
Gonna do it!

43:08.337 --> 43:10.714
Wait, okay, so let me
get this straight.

43:10.798 --> 43:13.092
You have sex with this girl.
We get a job out of it?

43:13.175 --> 43:14.260
Certainly seems that way.

43:14.343 --> 43:17.680
And to think this whole time, we
thought that poor girl was a hooker.

43:17.930 --> 43:19.431
Well, yeah.

43:19.515 --> 43:23.560
But in reality, the only
prostitute here is you.

43:36.115 --> 43:37.783
<i>No</i> one came again.

43:37.866 --> 43:40.369
Again? Why don't you
get better authors?

43:40.869 --> 43:43.205
Oh, you know, I never even thought of that.

43:43.289 --> 43:45.708
Yes, I've tried that.
I've been trying.

43:45.791 --> 43:47.584
<i>Well, come by my place
after for a drink.</i>

43:47.668 --> 43:49.003
<i>I'll come by after.</i>

43:49.684 --> 43:52.524
I don't understand why you won't tell me.
Just tell me where you did it.

43:52.548 --> 43:53.966
I'm not telling you,
so stop asking.

43:54.049 --> 43:55.801
Why? You know you're gonna tell me.
You tell me everything.

43:55.884 --> 43:57.261
I do. But I'm not
telling you this right now.

43:57.344 --> 43:58.679
Why?
'Cause I'm whupping your ass.

43:58.762 --> 44:00.306
You get all precious with this
stuff and you throw down,

44:00.389 --> 44:01.515
and slap me in the mouth.

44:01.598 --> 44:02.850
Whenever you start losing,
you just get upset.

44:02.933 --> 44:04.643
Dude, did you just take
another shit in there?

44:04.727 --> 44:06.145
No, I'm not.
Every time.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.688
Why do you care so much about
what I'm doing in there?

44:07.771 --> 44:08.772
I wasn't taking a shit.

44:08.856 --> 44:10.274
You're
so disgusting. Dude.

44:10.357 --> 44:12.776
Why do you guys care so much
what I do in the bathroom?

44:12.819 --> 44:13.900
And I wasn't taking a shit.

44:13.902 --> 44:14.903
Every time.
Yes, you...

44:14.987 --> 44:16.405
Have a little faith. What
are you guys talking about?

44:16.488 --> 44:17.614
Mikey won't tell me where
he had sex last night.

44:17.698 --> 44:18.699
Oh, Mikey, where did you
have sex last night?

44:18.782 --> 44:20.075
Why do you care so much
about where I had sex?

44:20.159 --> 44:21.160
'Cause we're your friends.
We wanna know.

44:21.243 --> 44:22.411
Where'd you have sex, Mikey?

44:22.995 --> 44:23.996
The hospital.

44:24.079 --> 44:25.414
With the glasses girl?
Are you serious?

44:25.497 --> 44:28.167
Oh, my God! You <i>Grey's
</i> Anatomy motherfucker!

44:28.250 --> 44:29.752
Mikey, that is awesome.

44:29.877 --> 44:31.337
Dude, your wife never would've
had sex in the hospital.

44:31.420 --> 44:33.339
She's too uptight.
Not in a million years.

44:33.422 --> 44:35.758
I'm fucking proud of you.
Really am proud of you.

44:35.841 --> 44:37.509
Whoa! What is that?

44:38.010 --> 44:39.261
I don't know.

44:39.345 --> 44:40.429
You order food?

44:40.554 --> 44:41.597
I mean, we're all here.

44:41.722 --> 44:43.557
I didn't order food. Did
you order food? No.

44:43.682 --> 44:44.850
Hey.

44:45.392 --> 44:46.602
So. It's Ellie.

44:47.728 --> 44:50.189
What the fuck?
Are you serious, dude?

44:50.272 --> 44:52.399
Jason, this is a den
of testosterone, man.

44:52.483 --> 44:53.859
This is a pre-game.
This is my apartment.

44:53.942 --> 44:55.027
That's a good point.

44:55.110 --> 44:57.738
It's not a good point. First of all,
guys, I just took a shit in there.

44:57.821 --> 44:59.031
I knew it.
It's every time.

44:59.114 --> 45:00.240
Why don't you take a shit
at your own apartment?

45:00.324 --> 45:02.701
You can't invite a girl
to a place like this.

45:02.785 --> 45:04.453
- I didn't invite her.
- You didn't invite her?

45:04.536 --> 45:05.788
No.
That's worse.

45:05.871 --> 45:07.539
That's some girlfriend shit.

45:07.623 --> 45:09.124
Some I-have-a-girlfriend
shit.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.377
Okay, well, I'm gonna
buzz her in.

45:11.460 --> 45:12.795
Don't buzz her.
Don't buzz her in.

45:12.878 --> 45:14.797
I'm gonna buzz her in.
Jason, don't buzz her in.

45:14.880 --> 45:15.881
Don't buzz...
Don't buzz her in, man.

45:15.964 --> 45:16.965
We're having such
good guy time right now.

45:17.049 --> 45:18.050
Oh, shit.

45:18.133 --> 45:19.134
I just buzzed her in.

45:19.218 --> 45:20.219
He fucking buzzed her in.
Okay.

45:20.302 --> 45:21.303
He buzzed her in.

45:21.387 --> 45:22.388
- Really?
- Okay.

45:22.471 --> 45:23.931
Both you guys need to calm down.

45:24.014 --> 45:26.308
We're not supposed to see them more
than twice in one week, all right?

45:26.392 --> 45:28.193
And you're seeing this chick
twice in one day.

45:28.268 --> 45:29.645
Dude. Relax.

45:29.728 --> 45:30.813
Invite her
up then, man!

45:30.896 --> 45:32.231
She's not gonna
wanna talk about Xbox.

45:32.314 --> 45:33.941
So, I'm gonna be
sitting here being like,

45:34.066 --> 45:35.692
"I have to fart but
maybe I can't right now."

45:35.776 --> 45:38.028
She better have some hot friends.
Dude, you're pissing me off.

45:38.112 --> 45:40.989
Open the door. I don't care.
I'm getting wasted.

45:41.073 --> 45:42.157
Hey.l hope
I'm not interrupting.

45:42.282 --> 45:43.283
Hi.

45:43.367 --> 45:45.953
No. You're not interrupting.
You're not interrupting anything.

45:46.036 --> 45:49.540
So this is this is Daniel. This is Mikey.
We went to college together.

45:49.623 --> 45:50.916
Guys, Ellie.

45:50.999 --> 45:52.835
Daniel is a manipulative idiot.

45:52.879 --> 45:54.039
And Mikey has an orange dick.

45:54.044 --> 45:55.045
Hi.

45:55.129 --> 45:56.255
Really, dude?

45:56.338 --> 45:57.756
That's really good to know.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.509
I brought scotch. I don't know
if you guys drink scotch.

46:00.884 --> 46:02.094
She brought scotch?

46:02.177 --> 46:03.178
You should try it.
Hmm!

46:04.012 --> 46:05.013
Let's try it.

46:05.097 --> 46:06.640
What are you guys playing?

46:06.723 --> 46:07.724
A little XboX.

46:07.808 --> 46:08.809
Can I play?

46:15.107 --> 46:16.191
Yeah.

46:44.761 --> 46:46.722
Apparently, her ex-boyfriend
played a lot of <i>Halo.</i>

46:48.223 --> 46:51.059
You know what? It's late. I gotta go.
I gotta go to West Side.

46:51.143 --> 46:53.645
No, you're not. We're not letting you.
No. We're not letting you go.

46:53.729 --> 46:55.314
I promise you we get funnier.

46:55.397 --> 46:58.525
But tonight is Mikey's night.
You know, I can feel it.

46:58.609 --> 46:59.690
I pray to God it is.

46:59.693 --> 47:00.736
That's what I was
telling you, too, baby.

47:01.278 --> 47:03.989
I forgot to tell you, it's
my birthday coming up soon.

47:04.072 --> 47:05.115
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

47:05.199 --> 47:07.493
Usually people are
more subtle about this.

47:08.911 --> 47:10.204
No, not like that.

47:10.287 --> 47:13.332
I'm going to throw myself
a surprise birthday party.

47:13.415 --> 47:15.295
You're throwing yourself
a surprise party? Yeah.

47:15.375 --> 47:16.418
Well, I'm surprised.
Yeah,

47:16.502 --> 47:18.837
everybody's gonna get
dressed up and decked out.

47:19.004 --> 47:20.085
And you should do the same.

47:20.088 --> 47:21.798
It's a dress-up party?
Absolutely, yeah.

47:21.924 --> 47:22.883
I'm so in. I love
getting dressed up.

47:22.966 --> 47:24.009
Sweet.

47:24.092 --> 47:25.344
He's actually
giving her eye contact?

47:25.427 --> 47:26.512
He's engaged.

47:26.595 --> 47:27.804
Bye.
Bye.

47:27.930 --> 47:29.765
That's a great painting,
by the way.

47:29.848 --> 47:30.933
Thank you.

47:40.669 --> 47:42.629
That's nice.
It was beautiful, man.

47:42.653 --> 47:44.446
That was really nice.
That was quite nice.

47:44.863 --> 47:46.323
And I do love her.
I do.

47:46.448 --> 47:47.741
I really like her.

47:47.824 --> 47:50.536
I really liked it when she came
by without telling anybody.

47:50.619 --> 47:52.955
I really liked it when she
kissed you on the cheek.

47:53.038 --> 47:56.583
And I really like that you're
about to lose this bet.

47:56.667 --> 47:57.707
Yep.
Jason, do you remember

47:57.751 --> 47:59.378
when we said we're
all gonna stay single?

47:59.461 --> 48:01.022
Yeah, well, it looks
like you're fucked.

48:01.046 --> 48:02.047
I'm not fucked.

48:02.130 --> 48:03.131
You are so fucked!

48:03.215 --> 48:04.716
I'm not fucked.
Let's go out.

48:10.806 --> 48:12.641
Hey, Chels!
Hey. Sorry, guys.

48:12.724 --> 48:14.004
Can we get
tequila shots, please?

48:14.059 --> 48:15.102
Sotheby's kept me late.

48:15.185 --> 48:16.436
Then they can take
care of these drinks.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.729
Oh, they will?
Hey.

48:17.813 --> 48:19.731
It's good to see you.
You, too.

48:20.399 --> 48:22.359
- I'm still going.
- That's not cool.

48:22.484 --> 48:24.194
All right cheers!
Cheers!

48:28.865 --> 48:30.325
Oh, Chels, you're up.

48:31.034 --> 48:32.327
Get it.

48:35.581 --> 48:37.249
Oh, my God, I love your shoes.

48:37.332 --> 48:39.793
Oh, thank you.
That's so sweet.

48:40.377 --> 48:41.587
That should've been me.

48:41.712 --> 48:42.921
This is my friend, Daniel.

48:43.005 --> 48:44.423
Hi.

48:44.506 --> 48:45.841
Hi.

48:50.679 --> 48:51.930
Nice to meet you.

48:52.014 --> 48:53.515
Nice to meet you.

48:58.937 --> 49:00.063
Okay.

49:00.522 --> 49:01.857
Okay.

49:03.358 --> 49:04.484
What...

49:04.610 --> 49:05.694
The fuck was that?

49:06.320 --> 49:07.779
Seriously.
That was god-awful.

49:07.863 --> 49:08.947
That was horrendous.

49:09.031 --> 49:10.073
I got nothing...
I don't know.

49:10.157 --> 49:12.367
Are you serious right now? You
just dropped the ball. Seriously.

49:12.451 --> 49:14.161
You just dropped
the ball big time.

49:14.244 --> 49:15.537
I'm having an off night.
I don't know.

49:15.621 --> 49:16.702
Having an off night?

49:16.747 --> 49:18.248
Even Jordan has off nights.

49:18.332 --> 49:19.458
Whoa!

49:19.541 --> 49:21.043
Very ambitious.

49:49.404 --> 49:50.864
What? What's wrong?

49:50.947 --> 49:52.491
That teddy bear.

49:52.574 --> 49:53.659
Mr. Wiggles?

49:53.742 --> 49:55.535
Fuck, Mr. Wiggles.
Yeah, Mr. Wiggles.

49:55.619 --> 49:56.870
Because, I know,

49:57.829 --> 49:59.509
your ex-boyfriend
gave you that teddy bear.

49:59.581 --> 50:01.708
And I said he was a pussy,
which he was.

50:01.792 --> 50:03.032
And then you broke up with him.

50:03.085 --> 50:05.170
But I was thinking
about you guys together.

50:05.253 --> 50:07.172
And him having sex with you. And
then I thought about him naked.

50:07.297 --> 50:09.297
And you know. And all that stuff.
Oh, really? Yeah.

50:09.341 --> 50:12.427
And my boner just started
to wilt like warm lettuce.

50:12.672 --> 50:14.072
I'm gonna get rid
of the teddy bear!

50:14.096 --> 50:15.180
Thank you.

50:18.141 --> 50:20.018
Creeped me out.
Yeah.

50:20.227 --> 50:21.353
Um...

50:21.436 --> 50:23.814
Chelsea, I just really
want you to know something.

50:23.897 --> 50:25.357
And I wanted to be very clear.

50:25.440 --> 50:28.527
You're not looking for
anything serious right now?

50:30.028 --> 50:33.448
Look, Daniel, this thing
doesn't have to be a thing.

50:34.282 --> 50:36.159
And if you want to go
back to being friends,

50:36.284 --> 50:38.120
we can go back to being friends.

50:38.203 --> 50:39.913
I don't want to go
back to anything.

50:39.996 --> 50:41.832
That's what I was
going to tell you.

50:43.250 --> 50:45.252
I really like being here.

50:49.715 --> 50:51.633
That's what I was going to say.

50:58.765 --> 51:00.308
You working this weekend?
Mmm-hmm.

51:02.436 --> 51:04.146
You should come by the hospital.

51:04.229 --> 51:05.230
Again.

51:05.313 --> 51:06.314
Yeah. Again.

51:06.398 --> 51:07.441
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

51:07.524 --> 51:08.859
Yeah, I would.

51:08.942 --> 51:11.987
Come by again and
again and again.

51:15.907 --> 51:16.988
<i>Check this one out.</i>

51:16.992 --> 51:18.493
That's impressive.
Very impressive.

51:18.577 --> 51:19.828
Something
for the two of you?

51:20.162 --> 51:21.413
What's up, man?

51:21.496 --> 51:22.873
Something for the two of you?

51:22.956 --> 51:26.752
Oh, no, no, no.
We're not gay, man.

51:26.835 --> 51:28.628
And we're just... We just
need a giant strap-on dildo.

51:28.712 --> 51:31.381
Which I know sounds a little gay.
But it's for a costume.

51:32.174 --> 51:34.801
It's right here.
Right in front of you.

51:35.343 --> 51:37.220
Wait. lhave a serious
question for you. Yeah.

51:37.304 --> 51:38.597
Think.

51:38.680 --> 51:40.766
If you were gay,
would you date me?

51:40.849 --> 51:42.100
Definitely not.

51:42.184 --> 51:43.351
What?
What?

51:43.435 --> 51:44.978
I would not date you, Jason.

51:45.061 --> 51:45.729
Why?

51:45.812 --> 51:47.147
Because you're not my type.

51:47.939 --> 51:49.099
What the fuck does that mean?

51:49.107 --> 51:50.192
Oh, what?
Are you offended?

51:50.275 --> 51:51.526
I'm completely offended.

51:51.610 --> 51:52.861
Deal with it.

51:54.196 --> 51:56.323
You'd gay date me.
You know you would.

51:56.406 --> 51:58.533
Honestly, if were to have
sex with you, Jason,

51:58.617 --> 52:00.285
which apparently
you really want,

52:00.368 --> 52:02.579
you would probably be like
top three hottest chicks

52:02.662 --> 52:03.705
I've ever had sex with.

52:03.789 --> 52:05.457
That's actually true.
Mmm-hmm.

52:05.540 --> 52:06.833
Man, how much are these?

52:06.917 --> 52:08.752
For you? $75.

52:08.835 --> 52:11.254
For me? 'Cause
we're such good friends?

52:12.339 --> 52:14.424
These are all dishwasher safe.

52:14.519 --> 52:16.360
I don't think you should
go to this party, man.

52:16.384 --> 52:18.261
Dude, I can go to the party.
It's gonna be fun.

52:18.345 --> 52:19.346
$65.

52:19.429 --> 52:21.932
Dude, who the fuck are you
negotiating with right now?

52:23.225 --> 52:24.434
$60.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.354
Okay. Look. I'm
telling you, man.

52:27.479 --> 52:28.814
This party is a road
to a relationship.

52:28.897 --> 52:32.150
And that road is paved with
responsibility and lack of selfishness.

52:32.234 --> 52:34.402
And what the fuck am I holding right now?
What is this?

52:34.486 --> 52:35.612
I have no idea.

52:38.532 --> 52:39.533
Ah!
Clever.

52:40.575 --> 52:42.244
It comes with an extra balloon.

52:42.327 --> 52:43.662
Why would I need
an extra balloon?

52:43.745 --> 52:45.455
In case it pops.
Why would it pop?

52:46.498 --> 52:48.124
If you try too hard.

52:50.252 --> 52:51.419

53:06.309 --> 53:09.729

53:19.531 --> 53:20.657

Happy birthday!

53:34.588 --> 53:37.215
Jason? What are
you wearing?

53:37.299 --> 53:39.634
Rock out with my cock out.

53:40.468 --> 53:42.470
It's not my real cock, though.

53:43.388 --> 53:44.389
Clearly.

53:44.472 --> 53:45.473
Yeah.

53:45.557 --> 53:46.683
Uh...

53:46.975 --> 53:48.852
So it's a different
kind of dress-up party?

53:48.935 --> 53:49.935
Yeah.

53:49.978 --> 53:54.316
This is a classic
case of miscommunication.

53:54.524 --> 53:55.567
It's really...
It's just a classic.

53:55.692 --> 53:56.776
Yeah.

53:57.777 --> 53:59.487
Um... Oh.

54:03.074 --> 54:04.159
Um...

54:05.076 --> 54:06.661
These are my parents.

54:07.203 --> 54:09.539
My mom, Jodie, and my dad, Bill.

54:09.623 --> 54:10.749
Holy shit.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.167
This is Jason.

54:13.126 --> 54:14.586
I'm sorry. Hi.

54:14.669 --> 54:16.421
I'm just gonna pretend that
this isn't happening. Hi.

54:16.504 --> 54:17.923
Hello.
Hi. I'm Jason.

54:18.006 --> 54:19.006
Hi.

54:19.049 --> 54:20.342
Bill.
Jason. Nice to meet you.

54:20.425 --> 54:21.426
Oh, goodness.
Oh!

54:21.509 --> 54:22.709
That should not have happened.

54:22.761 --> 54:24.220
That shouldn't have happened.

54:24.304 --> 54:25.305
Yeah.

54:27.933 --> 54:29.434
It's a cocktail.

54:31.686 --> 54:33.021
Shouldn't have said that.

54:35.857 --> 54:39.986
I'm just gonna go
and check the...

54:43.198 --> 54:44.783

55:20.902 --> 55:22.237
No. I got to hand it
to you, man.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.655
I'm impressed by the
way you hung in there.

55:23.738 --> 55:25.991
I should have left. I
definitely should have left.

55:26.074 --> 55:27.826
I guess I'm a sucker for abuse.

55:27.909 --> 55:29.285
You must be.

55:29.369 --> 55:31.496
You know the hardest part
about this costume?

55:31.579 --> 55:34.666
It was seeing this thing
next to my actual dick.

55:34.749 --> 55:35.875
I can only imagine.

55:35.959 --> 55:39.045
I didn't know whether
to cry or go kill myself.

55:39.504 --> 55:41.673
What are you laughing at, Bill?

55:43.091 --> 55:44.759

55:45.510 --> 55:47.012

55:48.513 --> 55:50.265
Don't encourage him, Dad.

55:51.349 --> 55:52.767
Don't encourage him.

55:58.189 --> 55:59.607
So?

56:03.028 --> 56:04.279
So?

56:06.197 --> 56:09.951
What do Jason and
Mikey think about this?

56:13.038 --> 56:14.289
What do you mean?

56:14.789 --> 56:17.292
Well, I mean,
like, whatever we're doing.

56:18.460 --> 56:19.836
What have you told them?

56:22.505 --> 56:24.799
I mean, I told them everything.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.427
Yeah. They're really
happy for you.

56:28.219 --> 56:29.471
Sorry. They're
happy for me?

56:29.596 --> 56:30.805
They're happy for both of us.

56:30.889 --> 56:33.641
They're just so happy
for the two of us.

56:34.309 --> 56:36.644
That's what they... Yeah,
they're just really happy.

56:36.728 --> 56:38.813
And Jason's taking it okay?

56:39.230 --> 56:42.734
Yeah. I mean, he was
a little angry at first,

56:42.817 --> 56:45.862
but now he's in the
fourth stage of grieving.

56:46.196 --> 56:47.280
Denial?

56:47.363 --> 56:48.990
Masturbation.

56:49.741 --> 56:51.493
You know what's so cool?

56:51.576 --> 56:53.912
When I'm being really
serious and you're like,

56:53.995 --> 56:56.414
"Hey, I'm Daniel.
I'm, like, really funny."

56:56.498 --> 56:57.832
I don't sound
anything like that.

56:57.916 --> 56:58.917
You sound exactly like that.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.502
"Hey, I'm Daniel."

57:00.585 --> 57:02.295
You sound like you have
peanut butter in your mouth.

57:02.378 --> 57:04.130
No.
What do you want me to say?

57:04.214 --> 57:06.466
They think it's cool
that I'm slumming it?

57:07.884 --> 57:10.136
Slumdogging?

57:11.846 --> 57:15.558
No. Honestly, I'm just
happy you told them.

57:16.643 --> 57:18.895
I know how you are with girls.

57:19.687 --> 57:21.189
Or at least how you've been.

57:29.739 --> 57:31.032
You know what?

57:31.533 --> 57:32.867
Your dad...

57:34.577 --> 57:35.787
Awesome.

57:37.330 --> 57:40.875
Well, he likes you, too, even
though you had that thing on.

57:42.043 --> 57:43.795
Maybe that's why he liked me.

57:46.714 --> 57:48.716
You know you don't have to
clear up anything.

57:48.800 --> 57:49.884
You don't have to help.

57:49.968 --> 57:51.261
No, I want to.

57:51.386 --> 57:53.721
You can't wake up to this.
It's disgusting.

57:53.805 --> 57:55.640
The apartment or you?

57:57.350 --> 57:58.893
You've always hated me.

57:58.977 --> 58:00.353
Just stop talking
for one minute.

58:00.436 --> 58:02.897
I know it's really hard,
but you can just try.

58:03.189 --> 58:04.524
You've always hated me.

58:42.103 --> 58:43.646
Okay-
Okay-

58:43.730 --> 58:46.608
Last night was amazing.

58:48.276 --> 58:49.611
And this morning.

58:51.696 --> 58:53.696
<i>Do you think you
could grow old in New York?</i>

58:54.032 --> 58:55.992
I'm not gonna get old.

58:56.075 --> 58:57.785
Getting old looks so tiring.

58:57.869 --> 59:00.371
I know. You just, like,
wake up in the morning

59:00.455 --> 59:03.041
and have to figure out what
to do in between meals.

59:03.124 --> 59:04.500
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

59:04.584 --> 59:08.630
I'm gonna get an old Jaguar
XK-E, completely restored.

59:08.713 --> 59:10.715
And then I'm gonna
eat a ton of acid.

59:11.299 --> 59:14.260
Like, so much acid that if you
went to go see Cirque du Soleil,

59:14.344 --> 59:16.262
you'd think you
were in Connecticut.

59:18.306 --> 59:20.266
And then I'm gonna speed up
the West Side Highway,

59:20.308 --> 59:23.561
as fast as a car can go,
crash through the divider,

59:23.645 --> 59:25.730
and careen off into the Hudson.

59:25.813 --> 59:27.523
In slow-motion,
of course.

59:27.607 --> 59:28.983
Of course.

59:29.067 --> 59:30.568
And that would be it.

59:30.652 --> 59:32.987
My death, premeditated.

59:33.947 --> 59:34.948
Okay.

59:35.031 --> 59:37.033
I mean, here's what's
actually gonna happen.

59:37.158 --> 59:38.785
What?

59:38.868 --> 59:41.162
You'll be 70 years old.

59:41.246 --> 59:43.164
So you'll think
you're going 150,

59:43.248 --> 59:45.583
but actually you're going
25 at best, 15 at worst.

59:45.667 --> 59:48.711
You can't see, so the acid
you think you're eating

59:48.795 --> 59:50.421
will actually be
an errant Lipitor.

59:50.505 --> 59:53.007
You're going to forget what you were
doing in the car in the first place,

59:53.091 --> 59:55.093
bump into the divider,
wet yourself, ruin the car,

59:55.176 --> 59:57.428
lose your license, and your
dignity in one fell swoop.

59:57.512 --> 01:00:00.181
And then you're gonna be ushered
off into some rest home,

01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:01.266
where you have to
wake up in the mornings,

01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:04.018
and figure out what the hell
to do in between meals.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.982
You know, you don't have to be right
about everything all the time?

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:19.993
How's Ellie?

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:24.455
What do you mean?

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:25.540
What do you mean what do I mean?

01:00:25.623 --> 01:00:27.625
Nothing.
What are you talking about?

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:30.712
What are you talking about?
So? What's up?

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:32.130
Nothing. Where's Chelsea?

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:33.923
What do you mean?

01:00:34.007 --> 01:00:36.801
I mean, where is
Chelsea is what I mean.

01:00:39.387 --> 01:00:40.972
I gotta talk to
you about Chelsea.

01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:42.432
Oh!

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:45.226
What's going on?

01:00:46.519 --> 01:00:48.187
Why are you so happy?
Yeah?

01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:50.106
I can't be happy to
see my two best friends?

01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:51.816
That's not a happy-to-see-your-
two-best-friends face.

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:53.067
No?

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.986
What is going on?

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:56.571
You're girl happy.

01:00:56.654 --> 01:00:58.656
Look at me.
Did you bone again?

01:00:58.740 --> 01:00:59.907
You boned again, didn't you?

01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:01.072
No. What are you...
Did you?

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.494
No. That's ridiculous. Can you
stop looking at me like that?

01:01:03.578 --> 01:01:05.163
You're a fucking animal!
Yes, you did! Did you?

01:01:05.246 --> 01:01:06.581
Did you? Hmm?

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:07.665
Who was it?
Glasses girl?

01:01:07.749 --> 01:01:08.791
Was it?

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.251
Glasses girl.
Was it?

01:01:10.335 --> 01:01:11.544
Hey! Oh!

01:01:12.962 --> 01:01:14.339
Wow. Mikey.

01:01:14.422 --> 01:01:16.302
It's the beginning of a
beautiful roster, buddy.

01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:17.675
Yeah, man. I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you.

01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:19.039
Thank you.
I'm also proud of you.

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.773
Your phone is ringing.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.807
Are you going to answer that?
No.

01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:26.267
Mmm. You should.
It might be a hot

01:01:26.351 --> 01:01:27.518
lonely girl looking
to talk to me,

01:01:27.602 --> 01:01:29.062
but she has your number.

01:01:29.145 --> 01:01:30.438
No. It's Ellie.
No, it's not.

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:31.606
I can read it. It's
right there on the bar.

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.608
It says, "Ellie." See that?

01:01:34.776 --> 01:01:35.818
I'll get it later.

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:37.028
That's real mature.

01:01:37.111 --> 01:01:38.151
Yeah. You should
answer it,

01:01:38.154 --> 01:01:39.364
because she's your girlfriend.

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:41.240
It's... Yeah.
My girlfriend.

01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:42.950
Oh, shit.
She's calling again.

01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:44.035
Back to back?

01:01:44.118 --> 01:01:46.704
Answer that phone! She might
need you to pick up diapers!

01:01:46.788 --> 01:01:48.122
Or, like, tampons,
or something like that.

01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:49.749
I'm outwith you guys.
I'm not fucking answering it.

01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:51.000
Well, I'm gonna answer it.
I wish I wasn't.

01:01:51.084 --> 01:01:54.712
Hey, Ellie! What's up? No, it's Daniel.
It's Jason's best man.

01:01:54.796 --> 01:01:56.214
He just crossed a line.
It's his best man friend.

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:57.757
Best man? What are you talking about?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.592
All right.
Here he is. Here he is.

01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:01.177
Hi.
Hi.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.096
Hello. All strong arm-y.
You wanna strong arm me?

01:02:03.179 --> 01:02:04.472
He gets so angry.

01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:06.641
Yeah. Hello?

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.309
I can hear you.

01:02:12.647 --> 01:02:13.856
Ellie?

01:02:16.317 --> 01:02:18.236
Oh, my God.
What? What's up?

01:02:18.319 --> 01:02:20.113
Her dad just died.

01:02:21.864 --> 01:02:23.032
Her dad died.

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:38.756
You have to.
It's not even a question.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.924
You have to show up
at that funeral.

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:42.051
If I set foot anywhere near that
funeral, then we're dating.

01:02:42.135 --> 01:02:43.135
Then don't go, dude.

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:44.470
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:02:44.554 --> 01:02:45.555
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:02:45.638 --> 01:02:46.806
If he doesn't want
to go to the funeral,

01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:48.171
why should he go to the funeral?

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:50.309
Are you not a human being?
Do you not have a soul?

01:02:50.393 --> 01:02:51.811
Technically, she didn't
even invite me.

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:54.564
Technically? She has to
invite you to a funeral?

01:02:54.647 --> 01:02:56.774
Yeah. What, he's supposed
to show up and say,

01:02:56.858 --> 01:02:59.777
"Hey. I'm Jason. I'm actually
fucking the dead guy's daughter"?

01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:01.237
What're you talking about?

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:02.780
If anything, I'm just
gonna be a distraction.

01:03:02.864 --> 01:03:03.990
It's like...

01:03:04.115 --> 01:03:05.158
It's better than
being an asshole. Okay?

01:03:05.241 --> 01:03:06.562
It's better than
being an asshole.

01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:18.713
I know. l wish
I could be home, too.

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:22.633
Next year. I promise.
But happy Thanksgiving.

01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:30.099
I miss you, too.

01:03:30.933 --> 01:03:33.019
Tell Dad I say hello.

01:03:35.062 --> 01:03:36.230
I love you, too.

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:39.710
Yeah, no. Take your time.
Take your time.

01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:43.613
I'll be here.
Finishing up. Ah, yeah.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:48.534
Here. That's set.

01:04:13.518 --> 01:04:14.519
Oh!

01:04:14.602 --> 01:04:15.853
I'm so glad you came.

01:04:15.937 --> 01:04:17.230
You look great.

01:04:17.313 --> 01:04:19.065
You look great.
Nice flowers.

01:04:19.148 --> 01:04:21.734
Thank you. They're not for you.
They're for your grandma.

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:23.653
Grandma.
There you go.

01:04:23.736 --> 01:04:26.322
I picked them myself on the way over.
No big deal.

01:04:26.405 --> 01:04:28.199
God. She
is so sweet.

01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:29.492
I see where you
get your looks from.

01:04:29.575 --> 01:04:30.576
Shameless of you.
Yeah.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.078
What? I'm not trying to
have sex with your grandma.

01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:33.162
Ew. Gross.

01:04:33.246 --> 01:04:34.664
Unless you think she's into it.

01:04:34.747 --> 01:04:36.374
Don't think she's...
Then maybe I will. Grandma!

01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:37.833
Don't... He may be into it.
I'm just kidding.

01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:38.876
All right. I'm just saying.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.546
Like, in two generations I could be
responsible for making you again.

01:04:41.629 --> 01:04:42.880
Okay.
It's called science.

01:04:42.964 --> 01:04:44.423
It's called disgusting.

01:04:45.967 --> 01:04:48.135
So are Mikey and Jason coming?

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:50.805
No, I don't think they're
gonna make it this year.

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:57.144
Oh, babe, I'm so sorry.
I know I'm late.

01:04:57.478 --> 01:04:58.479
Traffic was awful.

01:04:58.646 --> 01:04:59.646
It's a holiday.

01:04:59.689 --> 01:05:00.856
Hi.

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:06.362
Oh, the turkey looks beautiful!

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:08.322
And you got the red I like.

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:10.741
I made everything
just how you like it.

01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:12.243
I know you did.

01:05:13.786 --> 01:05:15.454
Mmm. This red is so smooth.

01:05:15.538 --> 01:05:18.082
I don't know. It feels a
little off balance to me.

01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:19.625
Yeah?
What do you mean?

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:22.837
I don't know. Like
something doesn't belong.

01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:26.591
Maybe it needs to
breathe a little.

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:28.074
It has, like,
a chocolate undertone.

01:05:28.134 --> 01:05:30.386
Maybe you're just
reacting to that flavor.

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:34.473
Or maybe 'cause you're still
fucking Harold. I can't tell.

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:37.602
You know his jacket
is still in the closet?

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:39.520
It's a great jacket. Why's
it in the fucking closet?

01:05:39.604 --> 01:05:41.063
Can we please just enjoy this?

01:05:41.147 --> 01:05:43.348
I've been trying to pretend
that things haven't changed.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:44.400
Things have changed.

01:05:44.483 --> 01:05:45.901
Then what are we doing?

01:05:47.028 --> 01:05:48.404
What are we doing?

01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:53.451
We're having fun.
I don't know.

01:05:53.534 --> 01:05:54.869
"I don't know"?

01:05:57.079 --> 01:05:58.080
That's it?

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:00.583
"I don't know"?

01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:03.878
We had everything we wanted.

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:05.463
A great apartment.
A great job.

01:06:05.546 --> 01:06:07.214
You're making partner in a year.
I'm in the ER.

01:06:07.258 --> 01:06:08.458
We checked each other's boxes!

01:06:08.466 --> 01:06:10.176
Why didn't we
ever talk about kids?

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:16.515
It's because neither of us saw that
future and you know that's true.

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:27.193
Maybe I should go.

01:06:50.174 --> 01:06:51.926
I just need to hear you say it.

01:06:53.636 --> 01:06:54.929
Just say it.

01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:05.606
I don't love you anymore.

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.756
So, I said to Paul, after
our first lunch downtown,

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.300
I thought you two would
be perfect for one another.

01:07:33.384 --> 01:07:34.385
Mom.

01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:36.178
Susan, to be honest, I feel like
I'd be perfect with anybody.

01:07:36.262 --> 01:07:37.555
You know, for your daughter,
it was just right place

01:07:37.638 --> 01:07:38.806
at the right time.
Aw!

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:40.599
You know,
like working at Google.

01:07:40.975 --> 01:07:42.393
You've got a job at Google?

01:07:42.643 --> 01:07:44.770
No. I was just...
You know, that's not...

01:07:44.854 --> 01:07:46.147
Possible.
Right.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:49.734
Daddy, Daniel was actually just telling
Mom that he was too good for me.

01:07:50.151 --> 01:07:51.902
No. Daniel wasn't.
Was that right?

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:54.071
Now there, you're... Well, you're
taking it out of context, sir.

01:07:54.155 --> 01:07:56.198
It's the other way around.
I'm very lucky.

01:07:56.407 --> 01:08:00.202
Well, calm down, Daniel. We know
you're not too good for Chelsea.

01:08:00.828 --> 01:08:02.371
Paul?
Dad?

01:08:02.455 --> 01:08:04.707
And well, we are very
happy to have you here.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:07.585
I've got 3 grand on the Cowboys.
I could use a drinking buddy.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:09.462
Yeah, I'd love
a drink right now.

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:11.756
Let's get a drink!
Okay, great.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.675
You scared them away.

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:46.415
Thanks.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:09.897
What?

01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:24.161
Oh.

01:09:24.245 --> 01:09:26.162
I have wanted to
rip your clothes off

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.165
ever since you
walked into this party.

01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:31.544
Oh, my God, Grandma! Your
hands smell like stuffing!

01:09:36.841 --> 01:09:39.385
Wait, wait. I don't know.
Should we do this right now?

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.803
What, you're gonna
say no to sex?

01:09:40.886 --> 01:09:42.286
No. I love sex.
I love sex with you.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:45.515
But I'm saying, like, 'cause your
family's out there and stuff.

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:46.850
Oh, yeah.
And your dad is kind of...

01:09:46.934 --> 01:09:50.145
You know what? Maybe
stop being such a pussy.

01:09:52.106 --> 01:09:53.357
Okay.

01:10:20.676 --> 01:10:22.344
Did you lock the door?

01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:23.804
I think so.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.473
You think so or you know so?

01:10:26.557 --> 01:10:28.225
You came in after me.
You should have locked it.

01:10:28.309 --> 01:10:29.393
Shh! Quiet.

01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:35.983
I think it's your grandma.
She's coming for me.

01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:39.737
I knew I shouldn't have
given her those flowers.

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.488
She's coming for me.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:55.044
Jesus. What the fuck?

01:10:55.127 --> 01:10:56.128
Okay. Hey.
Oh, my God!

01:10:56.211 --> 01:10:57.254
Hey, dude.

01:10:57.379 --> 01:10:58.422
What the fuck are
you doing in here?

01:10:58.505 --> 01:10:59.590
Don't look at my
fucking dick, man!

01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:01.383
Oh, my God.
You guys are fucking?

01:11:01.467 --> 01:11:02.509
It doesn't mean what
you think it means.

01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:03.594
Oh, it doesn't?
Lt doesnW?

01:11:03.677 --> 01:11:04.929
No. it doesn't mean that.

01:11:05.012 --> 01:11:07.012
Oh, what does our relationship
mean to you, Daniel?

01:11:07.056 --> 01:11:09.141
Relationship? You guys
are in a relationship?

01:11:09.224 --> 01:11:10.476
You didn't tell him?

01:11:10.559 --> 01:11:12.269
You told me you told him!
You fucking lied to me.

01:11:12.353 --> 01:11:16.231
What I should have said in this
situation was that I didn't.

01:11:16.315 --> 01:11:17.441
Oh, of course.
L didn't tell him.

01:11:17.524 --> 01:11:18.609
Jesus Christ, Daniel.

01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:19.777
We're not dating, okay?
If that's what...

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.612
Oh, my God. Fuck you.

01:11:22.196 --> 01:11:23.280
What the fuck?

01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:24.485
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

01:11:24.531 --> 01:11:26.033
What the fuck is right!
What are you doing here?

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:27.660
Jesus! Does no one in
this house lock a door?

01:11:27.743 --> 01:11:29.703
Where are you coming from?
I was with Vera.

01:11:29.828 --> 01:11:31.038
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

01:11:31.163 --> 01:11:32.163
Your ex-wife?

01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:33.499
Why were you with Vera?

01:11:33.574 --> 01:11:34.935
'Cause I was
trying to work it out.

01:11:34.959 --> 01:11:36.168
But it's over now.

01:11:36.585 --> 01:11:37.962
Oh, my God.
Hey, man.

01:11:38.139 --> 01:11:39.940
Do not hug me with no pants on.
Bring it here.

01:11:39.964 --> 01:11:41.298
Do not hug me with no pants on.

01:11:41.382 --> 01:11:43.008
You're right.
Respect. Respect.

01:11:43.092 --> 01:11:44.718
What were you doing trying
to work it out with Vera?

01:11:44.802 --> 01:11:47.304
Because that's what I do, Jason.
I try to make things work.

01:11:47.388 --> 01:11:48.639
But you wouldn't
know anything about that

01:11:48.722 --> 01:11:49.848
'cause you always
playing shit safe.

01:11:49.932 --> 01:11:51.058
No. Because we had a deal.

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:52.942
- We were staying single.
- Wait. Single?

01:11:53.018 --> 01:11:54.103
It's a long story. We'll
talk about it later.

01:11:54.186 --> 01:11:55.946
I didn't go to a funeral.
You both lied to me

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.190
I did that for you.
I did that for both of you.

01:11:58.273 --> 01:12:00.317
Wait, wait, wait. You didn't
do any of this shit for us.

01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:01.777
You do everything for you.

01:12:01.902 --> 01:12:03.612
You want us to be
just like Jason.

01:12:03.696 --> 01:12:06.782
And I can't think of anything I want
more than to be nothing like you.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:09.326
Your wife fucked some other
dude and you're mad at me.

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:10.452
Whoa, man.

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.577
You wanna say that again?

01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:13.497
She might still be
fucking this dude. Oh!

01:12:13.706 --> 01:12:16.208
Stop it. You guys, stop it!
Get the fuck out!

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.292
Stop. Come
on, man.

01:12:17.418 --> 01:12:18.836
Your dick is touching me, man!
I'm sorry.

01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:20.713
You know what?
Fuck you guys!

01:12:20.796 --> 01:12:23.632
I can go back to my life!
My roster, my fun!

01:12:23.716 --> 01:12:25.926
All my shit!
And do it without you!

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:29.179
Okay? We weren't getting into
relationships! That was the deal!

01:12:29.768 --> 01:12:31.408
It really wasn't
about anything other than

01:12:31.432 --> 01:12:34.143
having my two best friends
and I back together again.

01:12:34.226 --> 01:12:35.394
That was it.

01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:37.312
Now look at the shit
you guys are in!

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:39.106
You're a sad man.

01:12:40.107 --> 01:12:42.109
Yeah. Fuck you, Mikey.

01:12:44.528 --> 01:12:45.529
Oh, wow.

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.324
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

01:12:49.408 --> 01:12:51.285
Such a special time of year.

01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:16.018
<i>♪ Under a sky no one sees</i>

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:21.482
<i>♪ Waiting, watching it happening</i>

01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:27.362

01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:38.165

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:16.703
Ellie?

01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:18.372
Hey.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:19.581
Hey.

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:22.042
Hey, look, I'd love to.

01:14:22.126 --> 01:14:23.127
Love to what?

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.462
Get a coffee.
Talk for a few hours.

01:14:25.546 --> 01:14:26.588
Get a drink after.
Maybe some tequila?

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:27.798
Jason.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:28.841
What? Is that not
what you just said?

01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:30.759
I could have sworn I just heard
you say that you wanted to...

01:14:30.843 --> 01:14:31.885
Jason.

01:14:31.969 --> 01:14:33.053
What?

01:14:41.812 --> 01:14:43.814
You weren't there for me.

01:14:45.232 --> 01:14:48.402
On a day when I really,
really needed you.

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:55.159
And being there for someone
when they need you?

01:14:55.242 --> 01:15:00.122
That's all
relationships are, Jason.

01:15:04.084 --> 01:15:05.419
That's all they are.

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:14.821
You Okay?

01:16:17.157 --> 01:16:18.408
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.210
I just can't...

01:16:30.337 --> 01:16:32.589
Can't stop thinking
about what she's doing.

01:16:33.507 --> 01:16:34.967
Like, when I'm not there.

01:16:38.512 --> 01:16:40.931
I know what the couch
looks like at her place.

01:16:43.725 --> 01:16:45.435
I just can't stop
imagining the different

01:16:45.519 --> 01:16:48.188
people that are
all sitting on it.

01:16:50.482 --> 01:16:51.817
A guy.

01:16:53.026 --> 01:16:54.361
A different guy.

01:16:55.112 --> 01:16:56.363
A new guy-

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:00.117
Just every guy but me.

01:17:01.285 --> 01:17:02.953
Sitting on that couch.

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:07.541
Well,

01:17:10.043 --> 01:17:13.130
it sounds to me like
you just need to get laid.

01:17:21.888 --> 01:17:23.307
I know this is
gonna sound crazy.

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:24.516
Then don't say it.
No.

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:28.645
This is gonna sound even more
crazy, given the new information.

01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:29.980
Shh.
No, listen.

01:17:33.734 --> 01:17:35.027
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:36.445
Wow. What?

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:42.534
I'm just still
getting over someone.

01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:45.329
Come on. You're gonna
go full-girl with it?

01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:49.750
I think I made
a terrible mistake.

01:17:51.376 --> 01:17:53.295
I know I can be selfish,
arrogant,

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.339
distant and
emotionally retarded.

01:17:55.422 --> 01:17:56.965
I'm just gonna stop
you right there because

01:17:57.049 --> 01:18:01.053
whatever it is that you're doing
right now is not what we do.

01:18:01.136 --> 01:18:03.680
I just needed
somebody to talk to.

01:18:03.764 --> 01:18:05.015
Jason?

01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:07.476
Don't you have any friends?

01:18:39.299 --> 01:18:40.884
These actually do go together.

01:18:41.968 --> 01:18:43.470
Didn't see that coming.

01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:47.641
I'm sorry.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:49.810
I know.

01:18:55.941 --> 01:18:56.983
I just...

01:18:57.067 --> 01:18:58.276
I don't know,
to be honest, I'm having

01:18:58.402 --> 01:18:59.569
so much fun
hanging out, you know,

01:18:59.653 --> 01:19:02.155
and chasing girls.
And doing the thing and...

01:19:02.906 --> 01:19:04.366
"Doing the thing"?
Yeah, I miss that.

01:19:04.449 --> 01:19:06.201
And I'm not gonna be able to
do that if I'm with Chelsea.

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:07.452
You know that.

01:19:07.619 --> 01:19:08.745
I know.

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.080
Okay.

01:19:12.416 --> 01:19:13.917
Go tell her how you feel.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.043
Go make a scene.

01:19:15.168 --> 01:19:16.211
Yeah.

01:19:16.294 --> 01:19:18.046
Make a public spectacle.
Yeah.

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:20.090
Dude. Go big.
Do it like the movies.

01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:21.174
Like the movies. Yeah.

01:19:21.258 --> 01:19:22.467
Like Jerry Maguire.
I love that movie.

01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:23.969
I love that movie, man!
So good.

01:19:24.052 --> 01:19:25.303
"You had me at hello."
What?

01:19:25.429 --> 01:19:26.909
Don't ever do that again.
Okay? Sorry.

01:19:26.972 --> 01:19:28.348
But tell me what you
love about her, man!

01:19:28.432 --> 01:19:29.975
What do you love about her?
I love the way she laughs.

01:19:30.058 --> 01:19:32.561
I like the way she fake laughs
when she knows that I need it.

01:19:32.644 --> 01:19:33.687
Yes.

01:19:33.854 --> 01:19:34.896
I love the way we
fit together in bed.

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.982
Because we're the same height,
our crotches line up perfectly.

01:19:37.065 --> 01:19:38.066
That's really good.

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:39.401
I love that about it!

01:19:39.484 --> 01:19:40.610
I mean, what are
the chances, right?

01:19:40.694 --> 01:19:43.905
I love the way that
she looks in the morning.

01:19:43.989 --> 01:19:45.782
Like at that exact moment
when she wakes up,

01:19:45.866 --> 01:19:47.866
and her eyes just open
like two little butterflies.

01:19:47.868 --> 01:19:49.161
Two little...
I love that!

01:19:49.244 --> 01:19:50.287
I love that!

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:51.621
Yeah, man.
But I wouldn't go there.

01:19:51.705 --> 01:19:53.290
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
Okay.

01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:54.458
So run and tell her that.
I'm gonna go.

01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:56.126
Don't go all Notebook with it.
But run and tell her that.

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:57.419
I'm doing it.
Do it.

01:19:57.502 --> 01:19:58.503
I'm doing it.
Do it, man.

01:19:58.587 --> 01:19:59.713
I'm going.
Let's do it.

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:00.797
I'm gonna do it!

01:20:00.881 --> 01:20:01.882
Man, you're doing it!

01:20:02.507 --> 01:20:04.092
Oh, shit!

01:20:04.176 --> 01:20:05.844
Oh, my God!

01:20:06.303 --> 01:20:07.846
- Dude?
- Someone call 911!

01:20:10.807 --> 01:20:14.394
You took, like, four bags of fluid.
You were severely dehydrated.

01:20:14.478 --> 01:20:15.645
Oop!

01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:17.738
You need to be housebroken.

01:20:20.358 --> 01:20:23.487
I mean, what the hell
were you doing?

01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:24.779
I was running.

01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:25.906
Why?

01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:27.240
Because I...

01:20:28.408 --> 01:20:29.576
I'm sorry.

01:20:29.659 --> 01:20:32.300
I'm really, really sorry. I was
running to tell you that I'm sorry.

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:37.334
And I should have told these
guys that we were dating.

01:20:38.788 --> 01:20:40.188
From the beginning,
I told him that.

01:20:40.212 --> 01:20:41.773
We tried to convince
him the whole time.

01:20:42.339 --> 01:20:44.591
I want to date you, Chels.

01:20:46.092 --> 01:20:48.553
Like... Like,
really date you.

01:20:50.263 --> 01:20:51.890
I want that, too.

01:20:52.933 --> 01:20:54.100
Oh!

01:20:57.521 --> 01:20:59.105
You're such an idiot.

01:21:08.532 --> 01:21:10.033
I'm out.

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.668
<i>I was
wondering if you'd call.</i>

01:21:19.751 --> 01:21:20.751
So?

01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:22.462
<i>I'd love to see you.</i>

01:21:22.546 --> 01:21:24.506
No, seriously,
that took forever.

01:21:26.716 --> 01:21:28.593
I'd love to see you again.

01:21:29.803 --> 01:21:31.124
Ah! That's what
I'm talking about.

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:33.265
Honestly? Who
waits that long?

01:21:33.348 --> 01:21:34.975
<i>Yeah, that was my fault.</i>

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:04.921
Ooh, fucking guy in the red hat.

01:22:05.005 --> 01:22:06.631
Who the fuck are you?

01:22:09.801 --> 01:22:11.845
Let's find more pictures of you.

01:22:18.602 --> 01:22:19.644
Bingo.

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:24.190
Let's fucking look you up.

01:22:26.234 --> 01:22:27.444
Bill.

01:22:28.987 --> 01:22:31.906
What? William Matherson,
restaurateur.

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:33.992
What a piece of shit
this guy is.

01:22:38.038 --> 01:22:40.081
Oh, my God. Dude.

01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:01.571
I mean, honestly,
I just find it disgusting.

01:23:01.645 --> 01:23:03.446
The way that you guys
embrace the single life.

01:23:03.521 --> 01:23:04.981
The women?
The carousing?

01:23:05.065 --> 01:23:06.983
Carousing? Who are you?
Cary Grant?

01:23:07.067 --> 01:23:08.360
You've been in a relationship
all of two minutes.

01:23:08.443 --> 01:23:10.278
And he is already
a righteous asshole.

01:23:10.487 --> 01:23:12.030
Guys, look,
I'm just in love and shit.

01:23:12.113 --> 01:23:14.407
And I've had a lot of
time to sit and realize

01:23:14.574 --> 01:23:16.826
how disgusting both of you are.

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:18.578
- Mostly you, Jason.
- What about me?

01:23:18.662 --> 01:23:20.372
You're the worst. You're
pretty disgusting, too.

01:23:20.455 --> 01:23:21.915
You're gross.
I'm a killer.

01:23:22.123 --> 01:23:24.167
What the... Did you...

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:26.646
Did you post a funny
video on Ellie's wall?

01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:27.962
No.

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:31.549
Yes, you did, because I'm
looking at it right now, Jason!

01:23:31.633 --> 01:23:33.760
What is it, funny cute?
Or is it just funny?

01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:37.013
It is funny cute!
Jason, you pussy!

01:23:37.097 --> 01:23:38.765
You funny cute videoed her?

01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:40.850
I... Yes. I guess.
I don't freaking know...

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:42.977
I don't know
what I'm doing, man.

01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:45.021
Hey, man.
I think he loves her.

01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:46.147
I think that's love!

01:23:46.272 --> 01:23:47.315
It sounds like love to me.

01:23:47.399 --> 01:23:48.400
I don't know, man.
I don't know. Maybe I do.

01:23:48.525 --> 01:23:50.086
What do you mean,
you don't know?

01:23:52.844 --> 01:23:54.924
- Well, then you have to tell her.
- You have to.

01:23:54.948 --> 01:23:56.408
It'll be funny cute.
Maybe I should tell her.

01:23:56.491 --> 01:23:58.868
Which is right up your alley.
You love that shit.

01:23:58.952 --> 01:24:00.787
Ha, ha, ha.
Asshole.

01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:02.997
I don't even know where to...

01:24:03.081 --> 01:24:05.375
What's she doing? Let's stop by her place.
Where's she at right now?

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:07.699
Third Tuesday of the month.
She's at one of her readings.

01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.755
Whoa. That... That was
some stalker shit.

01:24:10.839 --> 01:24:12.048
That's creepy.

01:24:12.132 --> 01:24:13.383
It's creepy that you know that.

01:24:13.466 --> 01:24:14.676
I mean,
does anybody go?

01:24:14.801 --> 01:24:16.052
No! Nobody ever goes.

01:24:16.136 --> 01:24:17.387
Nobody ever shows up?
Nobody.

01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:19.806
Well, then, you are
going to be the guy

01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:23.184
who shows up.

01:24:24.102 --> 01:24:27.731
"We pounded along, my
father's hand on top of the wheel."

01:24:28.606 --> 01:24:29.858
Nobody ever shows up.

01:24:30.108 --> 01:24:31.109
Yeah.

01:24:31.276 --> 01:24:34.195
"I watched the bats crackle
and plunge against the sky.

01:24:34.446 --> 01:24:35.905
"They never knew here.

01:24:36.364 --> 01:24:39.117
"They only knew
the echo of there."

01:24:39.701 --> 01:24:40.702
Thank you.

01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:50.503
Thank you, Ray Floreson.

01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:51.671
I have to do something.

01:24:51.755 --> 01:24:53.275
Does anybody
have any questions?

01:24:56.176 --> 01:24:57.844
What should I do?
Something.

01:25:00.096 --> 01:25:02.515
Yeah. I have something
that I would like to read.

01:25:04.893 --> 01:25:06.102
From my novel.

01:25:06.436 --> 01:25:07.716
It's not really
the kind of place

01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:08.897
where you can share
from your own work.

01:25:09.022 --> 01:25:11.191
Thank you very much.
Honor to be here.

01:25:11.608 --> 01:25:12.859
This is good.
Um...

01:25:15.779 --> 01:25:16.863
Tough act to follow.

01:25:17.572 --> 01:25:19.032
Then don't.

01:25:20.283 --> 01:25:21.451
I'm a big fan of your work.

01:25:21.618 --> 01:25:23.203
I'm so sorry. I...

01:25:23.703 --> 01:25:24.954
No. Please.

01:25:40.053 --> 01:25:42.639
And then the other guy
asked to buy her a drink,

01:25:42.806 --> 01:25:44.307
right as Jason walked up.

01:25:44.849 --> 01:25:46.100
And so she asked that guy,

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:49.312
"What happens
if I enjoy the drink?

01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:51.231
"What happens then?"

01:25:52.899 --> 01:25:55.819
And he pretended not to know the answer.
So she told him.

01:25:56.778 --> 01:25:58.780
She asked if they
would play beer pong

01:25:58.947 --> 01:26:00.365
in that shitty bar
with his friends

01:26:00.532 --> 01:26:03.201
until they headed back
to his place in Murray Hill.

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:06.496
She asked if they'd have to
listen to his roommate

01:26:06.579 --> 01:26:09.749
fuck Hilary or Emily,
or whatever her name was

01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:11.459
till they fell asleep.

01:26:12.585 --> 01:26:14.504
And she asked him
if a year later,

01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:16.548
they'd still be
there in that bar.

01:26:17.924 --> 01:26:21.594
The only difference being that now
he feels pressure to get married

01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:25.473
and have kids, because he thinks
that that's what she wants.

01:26:27.267 --> 01:26:28.810
And then in the summers,

01:26:29.269 --> 01:26:31.104
they would drive up
to the shitty Hamptons.

01:26:32.814 --> 01:26:35.066
To meet his shitty parents.

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:38.111
Wondering the entire ride if they'd
think that she was pretty enough.

01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:40.363
Smart.

01:26:40.655 --> 01:26:43.157
Wondering the entire ride if
they think she's smart enough.

01:26:44.158 --> 01:26:45.368
Because no one was.

01:26:45.535 --> 01:26:47.370
And no one ever will be.

01:26:53.668 --> 01:26:55.378
And Jason knew that now.

01:26:57.297 --> 01:27:01.467
And he would give anything
to go back to that moment.

01:27:03.553 --> 01:27:07.390
The moment where they first met.
Before anything went wrong.

01:27:08.725 --> 01:27:13.897
Before he didn't show up for
her when she needed him most.

01:27:14.981 --> 01:27:17.066
Before he understood that
being there for somebody

01:27:17.233 --> 01:27:20.612
when it's most difficult is really
all that relationships are.

01:27:22.322 --> 01:27:23.823
Jason knew that now.

01:27:25.867 --> 01:27:29.996
And he was so sorry
for what he had done.

01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:37.545
But Jason also realized
that in that moment,

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:41.382
he wasn't afraid, because he

01:27:43.635 --> 01:27:45.470
thought she wasn't the one.

01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:51.309
He was absolutely terrified,
because he knew she was.

01:27:55.563 --> 01:27:58.900
And if she could give him
just one more chance,

01:28:01.736 --> 01:28:03.571
just one more chance,

01:28:06.324 --> 01:28:07.909
she knew where to find him.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:45.989
<i>It's 2:18 in the morning
in the middle of February.</i>

01:28:46.823 --> 01:28:49.826
<i>I've been sitting on a park
bench for almost four hours.</i>

01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:54.414
<i>I'm fucking freezing.</i>

01:28:55.915 --> 01:28:57.667
<i>Why am I sitting here?</i>

01:28:58.835 --> 01:29:01.212
<i>Why am I still
sitting on this bench?</i>

01:29:37.165 --> 01:29:38.958
<i>So?</i>

01:29:51.804 --> 01:29:53.806
I didn't know you
could change colors!

01:29:53.931 --> 01:29:54.932
Just stop.

01:29:55.016 --> 01:29:57.060
Your dick looks
like a sad giraffe.

01:29:57.268 --> 01:29:59.187
Your dick looks like a
shaved hamster. Stop.

01:29:59.270 --> 01:30:00.271
Can you guys STOP?

01:30:00.605 --> 01:30:04.108
Your dick looks like my dick

01:30:04.484 --> 01:30:07.987
if it were bigger and blacker.

01:30:11.282 --> 01:30:12.283
Cut!

01:30:13.201 --> 01:30:16.537
Did you friend
that girl yet, Mikey?

01:30:21.328 --> 01:30:22.728
Yeah. I told that
assistant at <i>Vogue</i>

01:30:22.752 --> 01:30:25.505
I couldn't hang out with her
'cause I was taking a shit.

01:30:26.172 --> 01:30:28.841
Whoa. Look at that fucking
crazy bruise on my arm.

01:30:29.008 --> 01:30:30.468
You see that bruise?

01:30:32.178 --> 01:30:33.805
It's from fucking acting, bro.

01:30:33.888 --> 01:30:34.889
Yeah.

01:30:35.014 --> 01:30:36.099
Fuck you up.

01:30:36.307 --> 01:30:39.268
Wait, I'm fucking this up. Can
we just do this one more time?

01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:40.853
Let it go.

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:43.272
It's 'cause you're holding
your imaginary dick the whole time.

01:30:43.356 --> 01:30:45.066
That might be it.
Can I just whip it out?

01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:47.485
Mike, we all know you're a two-hander.
So just, you know...

01:30:47.568 --> 01:30:49.779
Oh, shit. He knows me.

01:30:50.279 --> 01:30:53.282
That's not a nipple. That's not my...
That's a fake.

01:30:53.366 --> 01:30:54.784
That's a sticker. I don't
have nipples like that.

01:30:55.118 --> 01:30:57.912
So maybe I'm the best ever
receiving blowjob... Ever.

01:30:58.079 --> 01:31:00.706
At receiving.
Fucking mother sucker.

01:31:00.957 --> 01:31:04.001
So maybe I'm the best ever
at receiving blow...

01:31:04.127 --> 01:31:05.461
There are no
"evers" in the whole thing.

01:31:05.545 --> 01:31:06.546
What?

01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:08.297
Can we just write it
on her fucking head?

01:31:08.381 --> 01:31:09.966
Maybe I'm the best ever.

01:31:10.049 --> 01:31:11.050
No. No "ever."

01:31:11.175 --> 01:31:14.345
Probably gave me
the best blowjob ever,

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:17.640
in the recorded
history of blowjobs.

01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:22.645
"And she gave me perhaps the
best blowjob in recorded history."

01:31:22.937 --> 01:31:24.564
There's no "ever."

01:31:27.066 --> 01:31:28.317
What are you doing?

01:31:28.401 --> 01:31:29.861
I ain't doing nothing.

01:31:29.986 --> 01:31:30.987
Yes, you are.

01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:34.198
I promise. I'm acting
satisfied. Okay? Jeez.

01:31:34.365 --> 01:31:35.533
Oh, God.

01:31:35.992 --> 01:31:36.993
"Doing the thing"?

01:31:37.076 --> 01:31:38.286
Yeah, I miss that.
And I'm not gonna

01:31:38.411 --> 01:31:39.662
be able to do that
if I'm with Chelsea.

01:31:39.745 --> 01:31:42.582
I'm gonna miss, like,
sharing a mouth with you.

01:31:45.168 --> 01:31:46.711
I miss that so much, man.

01:31:49.422 --> 01:31:51.132
Oh, there's the paparazzi!

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.341
No way!

01:31:53.843 --> 01:31:56.679
Oh, my God! They're not
even pointed at Miles!

01:31:56.929 --> 01:31:57.972
Asshole!

01:31:58.139 --> 01:31:59.682
Nobody cares about me, bro!

01:32:00.057 --> 01:32:01.100
Aw!

01:32:01.642 --> 01:32:03.978
I might be really fucked up.

01:32:04.645 --> 01:32:08.691
But I think Omar from The
Wire is sitting on our couch.

01:32:13.237 --> 01:32:15.156
It's him! It's him!

01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:21.871
Yes!
