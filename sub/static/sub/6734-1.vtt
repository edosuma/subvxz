00:32.479 --> 00:34.599
I'm fragile.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.119
I feel pain, I hurt.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.065
I open my eyes.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.719
I create.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.039
I conquer.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.559
I hold power.

00:48.560 --> 00:49.919
I'm a thinker.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.399
I crave victory.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.759
I do not give up.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.439
I feel no fear.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.799
I fear no man.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.919
I'm an athlete, a warrior.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.421
An artist.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.399
If it was easy, everybody
would be good at it.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.839
I was told that long
time ago by a coach.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.159
If you want something
you never had before,

02:42.160 --> 02:43.279
you gotta be willing
to do something

02:43.280 --> 02:45.199
you've never done before.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.319
That's what I live by.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.599
I want to be two-time Mr. Olympia.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.159
I have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.119
You know, the record is
eight Mr. Olympia titles

02:54.120 --> 02:56.639
held by Lee Haney
and Ronnie Colman.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.239
Arnold Schwarzenegger won seven,

02:58.240 --> 02:59.759
Jay Cutler won four.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.839
I think for me it's just, I'm
already the best at what I do.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.639
I had to ask myself a serious
question, which was, can I get better

03:06.640 --> 03:08.279
than what I just did?

03:08.280 --> 03:10.959
And it was like, the next
day at a photo shoot, I knew.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.599
I don't like the way
I look right there.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.319
People would say, "Are you
crazy? You just beat everybody!

03:15.320 --> 03:17.999
You won with a perfect score."

03:18.000 --> 03:19.799
But in my heart,
I knew, I was like,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.199
"Phil, this is just the beginning."

03:21.200 --> 03:23.959
Your legacy is not gonna to be
dictated on winning one Olympia,

03:23.960 --> 03:26.383
it's going to be
dictated on how many.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.159
For all bodybuilders,
the experience is similar.

03:32.160 --> 03:36.239
They are an oddity,
stares, pointed fingers.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.479
They're in a freak show

03:37.480 --> 03:40.559
with no circus tent
to hide away in.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.559
For the 32-year-old
champ, it's an honor,

03:44.560 --> 03:47.439
an honor that fuels his
drive to secure position

03:47.440 --> 03:51.319
as the greatest
bodybuilder of his day,

03:51.320 --> 03:55.239
to prove that his win was no fluke.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.439
- All right, take care.
- Thank you!

03:59.440 --> 04:02.799
There's a lot of people out there
wondering, "Can he do it again?"

04:02.800 --> 04:05.319
So it's my job to remind them

04:05.320 --> 04:09.159
and the world that
I am the champion.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.150
And I'm gonna be here for awhile.

Please take the first-place award,

07:00.120 --> 07:02.599
the Olympia Gold Metal,

07:02.600 --> 07:07.319
the Sandow Bronze
Award, and the title

07:07.320 --> 07:11.879
of 2011 Mr. Olympia

07:11.880 --> 07:16.279
to our winner tonight...

07:16.280 --> 07:17.639
Phil Heath!

08:32.240 --> 08:35.679
Bodybuilding falls into
this unique category

08:35.679 --> 08:40.039
of, you know, being a sport,

08:40.039 --> 08:43.479
being entertainment,

08:43.480 --> 08:47.959
being a way of life,
and being also art.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.679
So you have to really have a sense

08:49.680 --> 08:53.519
of a sculptor to really
sculpt, to mold your body.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.079
The only difference is
that we in bodybuilding

08:56.080 --> 08:59.479
use a certain machine to
train the front deltoid,

08:59.480 --> 09:01.759
if it's missing, or a
certain machines to train

09:01.760 --> 09:04.159
the serratus or the intercostals,

09:04.160 --> 09:06.079
and an artist or a sculptor

09:06.080 --> 09:07.879
uses a chisel and a hammer.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.119
But it's all about what
is your vision about

09:11.120 --> 09:13.599
the way you should look
like as a finished product

09:13.600 --> 09:15.239
and how do you get it there.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.759
You're trying to take your body

09:18.760 --> 09:22.439
and sculpt it to where
everything is in proportion,

09:22.440 --> 09:27.039
everything from right side
to the left side is equal,

09:27.040 --> 09:28.399
and just being a true work of art.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.039
I think the main motivation for me

09:30.040 --> 09:33.279
with this whole
bodybuilding experience is

09:33.280 --> 09:36.839
knowing that there's no such
thing as "the perfect body."

09:36.840 --> 09:38.879
But I'm gonna chase
it as hard as I can.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.439
Joe Weider was really
the father of fitness.

09:43.440 --> 09:47.919
He created the Mr. Olympia
contest, and created

09:47.920 --> 09:50.239
the International
Federation of Bodybuilders,

09:50.240 --> 09:52.039
and the Mr. Olympia became

09:52.040 --> 09:54.719
the Super Bowl of bodybuilding.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.799
What does it mean
to be Mr. Olympia?

09:56.800 --> 09:59.439
It means to be the
best of the best.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.679
A great champion
is a lot of things.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.799
You have to be a role
model to a lot of people.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.239
You have to carry yourself as
a professional all the time.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.039
You have to go in and have
to train at 100 percent.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.319
You have to go to bed
every night and say,

10:12.320 --> 10:13.839
"Am I fulfilling the task

10:13.840 --> 10:15.519
of being the best at what I do?"

10:15.520 --> 10:17.159
Like in any sport,

10:17.160 --> 10:19.599
you can win it and
relax a little bit,

10:19.600 --> 10:21.279
or you can win it and stay hungry.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.879
Do you really want to, you
know, win it more that once?

10:24.880 --> 10:26.599
But there's never a guarantee.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.479
It comes down to the mind,

10:28.480 --> 10:31.159
the will, the determination,

10:31.160 --> 10:33.159
the discipline and the motivation.

10:33.160 --> 10:37.319
And you have that fierce drive
that nothing's gonna stop you.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.639
That's what makes you a champion.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.439
When you are a champion, you
never think you're gonna lose.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.279
This is you life,
and this is your job.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.239
This is your number-one
responsibility,

10:45.240 --> 10:47.319
your number-one priority in life.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.359
All you gotta do is continue
to do what you done before.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.479
Let them follow you.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.039
You don't have to follow them.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.519
So, if I try to change
up my training system...

10:56.520 --> 10:57.639
Why?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.439
Why would I change?

10:59.440 --> 11:00.959
I am who I am.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.519
They are who they are.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.919
They may try to change
to do what I'm doing,

11:04.920 --> 11:06.999
because I have
proven that it worked.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.359
I'm the leader, I'm the man.

11:09.360 --> 11:13.959
Not you, me, and it's
okay, because I look good.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.879
I think that Phil has the look,

11:16.880 --> 11:19.399
the physique, the mindset.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.519
I think he has the fire in
the belly to be a champion,

11:23.520 --> 11:26.559
which is something he wants to
do for the next several years.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.359
So I think we'll have
the next Ronnie Coleman.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.319
Phil Heath, also
known as "The Gift,"

11:31.320 --> 11:33.559
is the image of confidence.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.119
The Olympia competition
is still weeks away.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.679
Some of his contenders
have yet to qualify,

11:38.680 --> 11:40.959
yet he has no qualms about
having a suit tailored

11:40.960 --> 11:42.599
for his victory.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.239
I'm not gonna lie, I
mean, I kinda like knowing

11:45.240 --> 11:47.719
that when I win,

11:47.720 --> 11:50.079
not only I outshine them on stage,

11:50.080 --> 11:51.679
but then off stage.

11:51.680 --> 11:56.719
Because I know that
I'm covering every angle

11:56.720 --> 11:58.399
to be better than them.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.319
If I go out on the
town with the missus,

12:00.320 --> 12:01.839
or if I'm going out with the guys,

12:01.840 --> 12:03.479
I'm wearing
button-downs, you know,

12:03.480 --> 12:05.639
I'm wearing the same stuff,
the guy would be like,

12:05.640 --> 12:06.879
"How did you fit in that?"

12:06.880 --> 12:08.559
I say, "Well I got a tailor, bro."

12:08.560 --> 12:12.064
There are always
contenders waiting to rise.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.399
Waiting for the perfect moment

12:16.400 --> 12:19.267
to take advantage of a misstep...

12:21.520 --> 12:24.479
an unseen weakness.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.719
This is Kai Greene, his nemesis,

12:26.720 --> 12:30.119
his enemy, studying every pose.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.463
He has 11 weeks to prepare.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.199
For me, winning the Olympia

13:06.200 --> 13:11.359
is a celebration
for a lot of people

13:11.360 --> 13:13.959
that at least can share in the idea

13:13.960 --> 13:15.879
that well, you know,
maybe I wasn't born

13:15.880 --> 13:18.519
with the best genetics,
or maybe I wasn't born

13:18.520 --> 13:22.919
with the most dashing good looks,

13:22.920 --> 13:25.799
but there's something
to be said for hard work.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.879
So, you know, we can
say, "Keep your gifts."

13:29.880 --> 13:31.439
I work hard.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.879
I know how to work real hard.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.039
Even if I tear a bicep,

13:36.040 --> 13:38.079
I'm still gonna stay
on my discipline.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.759
Look at me from every angle,

13:39.760 --> 13:43.959
and you're not gonna
see one piece of my body

13:43.960 --> 13:45.959
that's undeveloped.

13:45.960 --> 13:50.199
I'm gonna develop
symmetry, conditioning,

13:50.200 --> 13:54.399
and I am going to
whup the ass of anyone

13:54.400 --> 13:55.959
that stands there believing

13:55.960 --> 13:59.159
that all it takes is genetics.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.119
Hard work beats
talent all the time.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.519
Well, that's what he's thinking.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.719
He thinks that hard work
is gonna beat talent.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.479
When talent actually
works hard, it's over.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.039
There's nothing that that
other person can do about it.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.359
That confidence has led
Phil to achieve a greatness

14:17.360 --> 14:19.079
few can dream of.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.919
But pride and arrogance
have been the downfall

14:20.920 --> 14:23.559
of many great men.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.959
Kai never had a family.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.079
His mother abandoned him
when he was a teenager.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.759
And from that point
on, he was raised

14:30.760 --> 14:35.079
by various foster parents,
moving from home to home.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.879
Kai grew angry and
aggressive over time.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.159
Before long, he found himself

14:40.160 --> 14:44.399
in a juvenile detention facility.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.879
His story would have ended there

14:45.880 --> 14:48.759
if he hadn't
discovered bodybuilding.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.959
The feelings of being
unsafe, feeling unsafe,

14:52.960 --> 14:55.439
constantly under threat.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.839
I remember I was in the process

14:56.840 --> 14:59.079
of being restrained while fighting,

14:59.080 --> 15:00.799
my shirt had gotten torn

15:00.800 --> 15:03.119
in the midst of the
whole demonstration,

15:03.120 --> 15:05.079
I'm taking the rest of the
shirt and throwin' it off.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.879
"Fuck that, what?"

15:06.880 --> 15:09.319
You know, you go through
this whole display

15:09.320 --> 15:13.319
of "I'm powerful, I'm
angry, I don't care!"

15:13.320 --> 15:17.439
You do this thing, and it
was some time after that

15:17.440 --> 15:21.759
the teacher, I had bumped
into him again maybe

15:21.760 --> 15:24.719
a week or so, back in population.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.519
He had said, "Hey, you know,
you got a physique on you!

15:27.520 --> 15:29.639
How you'd like to
think about competing

15:29.640 --> 15:32.399
against teenagers your own age?"

15:32.400 --> 15:33.999
I thought it was a joke.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.839
Back then, I never even
used to think that I would

15:36.840 --> 15:39.239
probably ever even get out of being

15:39.240 --> 15:41.079
in institutional placement.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.719
It's a lot easier for me

15:42.720 --> 15:45.639
to have been
identified as an animal.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.319
Going to the gym and
training, it was probably

15:49.320 --> 15:54.399
the single most important
therapeutic choice

15:54.400 --> 15:56.479
I could make on my own.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.319
And the people that were in my life

15:58.320 --> 16:01.199
have long since moved on.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.919
The one thing that's
remained consistent

16:02.920 --> 16:04.519
is still, you know, your focus

16:04.520 --> 16:08.502
towards achieving
this ultimate goal.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.199
Texas.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.879
Wide plains.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.759
Open spaces.

16:16.760 --> 16:20.519
Scorching heat.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.159
Branch Warren leads a simple life

16:22.160 --> 16:25.345
away from the hustle
and bustle of the city.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.639
I tore my quadriceps tendon,
and it completely detached.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.159
No one's ever come
back from injury,

16:34.160 --> 16:35.959
you know, that injury,
especially that fast.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.479
Most people, it ends their career.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.879
I did it in six months.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.160
And that was an accident, right?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.839
I was walking in the parking lot...

16:44.840 --> 16:46.319
in a thunderstorm.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.919
And...

16:48.920 --> 16:50.559
I slipped and fell.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.679
So, you never know
what kind of curve ball

16:52.680 --> 16:54.519
life's gonna throw at you, right?

16:54.520 --> 16:56.559
Some people cry and bitch
about it like little girls,

16:56.560 --> 16:58.439
you know, and be babies about it.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.079
A man, he has issues.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.039
He sets it aside, he
focuses on what he...

17:02.040 --> 17:03.759
what his job is and gets it done.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.279
I put my faith in God.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.159
You know, I learned
from a very young age

17:07.160 --> 17:08.919
that no one owes you anything,

17:08.920 --> 17:11.039
and there ain't nobody
gonna give you a damn thing.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.638
But you can have anything you want

17:12.640 --> 17:15.029
if you work hard enough for it.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.711
What's up?

17:23.280 --> 17:24.759
Gotta take care of
business in the gym.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.039
You're with the boys, so you
gotta do what you gotta do.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.879
And when you come home, you don't
bring that home to your family.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.879
Metroflex Gym.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.119
Built inside an old warehouse.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.439
Produced many of Texas'
greatest bodybuilders,

17:42.440 --> 17:44.319
including the great Ronnie Coleman,

17:44.320 --> 17:46.799
eight-time Mr. Olympia.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.559
Now it serves as a training
camp for Branch Warren

17:49.560 --> 17:52.239
and his training
partner, Johnnie Jackson.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.479
Yeah, baby!

17:53.480 --> 17:55.664
One more, go!

17:57.480 --> 17:59.199
Yeah!

17:59.200 --> 18:00.906
Come on, get some.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.639
Nobody beats you.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.948
Huh?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.799
I grew up in that gym.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.119
I mean, from learning how to
fight, to learn how to train,

18:11.120 --> 18:13.429
to learn how to be a man.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.399
I don't think there's one bodybuilder
on this planet that's competed...

18:23.400 --> 18:24.919
or even dreamed of competing

18:24.920 --> 18:26.479
that hasn't dreamed
of being Mr. Olympia.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.839
For 20 years, man,
I go to bed at night

18:27.840 --> 18:29.199
thinkin' about it, and I wake up

18:29.200 --> 18:30.559
in the morning thinkin' about it.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.959
I think about it when I train.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.679
I've accomplished everything in
this sport I set out to accomplish.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.239
I've got one contest left to win.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.079
I'll eat dirt if I have to
eat dirt to win this, so...

18:47.080 --> 18:48.679
I don't care.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.919
You know, you're
goin' against the 15-20

18:50.920 --> 18:52.439
best bodybuilders on the planet.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.799
We all wanna win.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.479
And I'm doing
everything in my power

18:55.480 --> 18:57.311
to make sure I win.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.879
Get out, move.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.719
Out of my face.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.039
Let's go.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.439
Branch is one of
those guys who just,

19:15.440 --> 19:17.079
I've never seen him
do anything right,

19:17.080 --> 19:19.519
or efficiently, he just
works hard at everything.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.159
You look at him train, you're like,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.799
"Man, I don't know how you
still have any joints left."

19:22.800 --> 19:24.599
And that's why it's
easy to pick on him.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.279
There's just no intelligence.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.319
There's no, like, it's pure work
ethic, man, which is great.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.519
And that's probably nine of the
top tens of guys in the IFBB,

19:32.520 --> 19:34.559
is they're doing the same
crap, day in, day out,

19:34.560 --> 19:36.999
year in, year out, not gettin' any
better, but then they think the result

19:37.000 --> 19:38.359
is gonna be better.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.679
Well, news flash for ya,
it's not gonna happen.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.879
Take a smarter approach,
take a different approach,

19:42.880 --> 19:45.159
you know, get better at
it, which is why I need...

19:45.160 --> 19:46.559
if I wanna compete with these guys

19:46.560 --> 19:48.079
and beat these guys, I need to take

19:48.080 --> 19:50.039
the most precise,
educated, scientific

19:50.040 --> 19:51.319
approach possible.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.799
The great thing about this machine

19:52.800 --> 19:54.559
it's gonna give us, you know,

19:54.560 --> 19:56.639
any ounce of fat that he loses,

19:56.640 --> 19:58.439
any ounce of muscle that he gains,

19:58.440 --> 19:59.599
it's gonna track it.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.999
It's extremely sensitive.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.399
Ben's faith in his scientific
approach to bodybuilding

20:04.400 --> 20:06.799
is complete and unquestioning.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.919
He has no shame in
comparing the failure

20:08.920 --> 20:11.519
of his opponents'
training philosophies

20:11.520 --> 20:13.079
to the efficiency of his own.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.839
You ask him to push
himself to a certain level,

20:14.840 --> 20:16.999
and he finds a way
to push past that.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.159
And we're tryin' to
kill him in the gym,

20:19.160 --> 20:21.639
you know, we're really
trying to push him mentally.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.919
That's perfect.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.359
That's perfect, right there.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.639
Squeeze harder.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.399
That's it, squeeze harder.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.799
That's it, perfect!

20:28.800 --> 20:30.679
That's exactly what we want, man.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.279
That... those last
three, four reps,

20:33.280 --> 20:35.439
you were activating
maximal amount of muscle.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.319
That's exactly what
we need for growth.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.359
Bodybuilding is the
most fascinating sport

20:39.360 --> 20:40.799
there is in the world.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.839
And in fact, this whole
laboratory is dedicated

20:42.840 --> 20:44.079
to studying bodybuilding.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.759
Even NFL linemen, they get big.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.399
And they get a lot of muscle.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.199
But how in the world
can you get massive

20:51.200 --> 20:53.559
and get shredded at the same time?

20:53.560 --> 20:55.599
This is completely counterintuitive

20:55.600 --> 20:56.919
to even science.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.799
So, to study how do you do that

20:58.800 --> 21:00.439
is phenomenal.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.399
I remember it clear
as day, Flex Magazine,

21:02.400 --> 21:04.679
I was 15 years old at
the YMCA in Toronto.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.079
And the guy sitting at the
front desk brought one in.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.479
I looked at the cover
of it, and I was like,

21:08.480 --> 21:10.639
"Man, that's
disgusting, that's gross.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.439
Man, I never wanna look like that."

21:12.440 --> 21:14.479
For me, it was more
along the lines of,

21:14.480 --> 21:16.279
well, I achieved my
goal, now, what's next?

21:16.280 --> 21:17.679
And I achieved my
goal, and what's next?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.839
So, first I wanna be
190 pounds with abs.

21:19.840 --> 21:20.919
Did it.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.879
Wanna be 210 with abs, did it.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.519
And I just keep pushin',
and pushin', and pushin' it.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.519
I guess I was just never content,
never happy with my body.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.799
That's really, you know,
where it started for me.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.799
Myself as a bodybuilder,
should be someone

21:31.800 --> 21:34.399
constantly striving to be
one percent better every day,

21:34.400 --> 21:36.919
you know, whether it
be in your workouts,

21:36.920 --> 21:38.399
in your approach to life,

21:38.400 --> 21:40.639
in your mentality,
in your nutrition,

21:40.640 --> 21:42.919
how meticulous you
are with nutrition.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.999
Just being better and better.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.559
Pushing your... every
aspect of your life.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.039
Like, I've always
known that Mr. Olympia

21:49.040 --> 21:50.279
was something I could do.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.919
If I want it, and
I set my mind to it,

21:52.920 --> 21:54.479
there's nothing that
can stand in my way.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.759
There you go, man, no pain.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.119
Come on, hit it, there you go!

21:57.120 --> 21:58.199
Drive it!

21:58.200 --> 22:01.039
You think this is fancy,
let's go, hurry up!

22:01.040 --> 22:02.919
Man, there's always somebody
trying to reinvent the wheel.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.599
I don't care what kind
of scientific formulas,

22:04.600 --> 22:06.399
or whatever it is you come up with,

22:06.400 --> 22:08.359
or nutrition or whatever.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.399
There's no substitute
for hard, hard work.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.199
And the pain and the
sacrifice, the sweat,

22:13.200 --> 22:14.639
all the hard work, man,

22:14.640 --> 22:16.119
when they announce you winner,

22:16.120 --> 22:17.719
it's all worth it.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.239
Heavy clouds loom
over Tampa, Florida.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.519
Roelly Winklaar arrives
from Rotterdam, Holland,

22:29.520 --> 22:32.399
with his trainer, Sibil Peeters.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.239
In the industry,
she's known as Grandma.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.591
But those who've trained with her
know her as the trainer from hell.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.065
Ah, rattlesnakes.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.919
I like snakes because I like

23:12.920 --> 23:15.519
how they eat the food, you know?

23:15.520 --> 23:16.839
Kill them.

23:16.840 --> 23:20.519
And then eat them, you know?

23:20.520 --> 23:23.559
The body's like this and
they eat like this, you know?

23:23.560 --> 23:25.319
That's the way I like it.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.079
They ask, "Where do you come from?"

23:27.080 --> 23:28.959
And I say, Curaçao.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.359
In the face, you can see that

23:31.360 --> 23:33.759
they don't know where
that is, you know?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.919
And I say, the Caribbean.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.548
Then everybody knows the Caribbean.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.199
The two always share a
bedroom during their travels,

23:44.200 --> 23:45.799
the mobile kitchen
and key ingredients

23:45.800 --> 23:49.304
traveling along with
them everywhere they go.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.199
Sibil herself used to be
a professional bodybuilder.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.959
Put the fish on it.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.279
But after the tragic
death of her husband,

23:58.280 --> 24:01.999
she dedicated her life
to training others.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.919
Grandma, is my food finished?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.679
Is my food finished?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.439
Your food is finished.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.479
In the Netherlands,
I trained like a week

24:10.480 --> 24:12.559
with the guys.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.039
My body grows fast, you know?

24:15.040 --> 24:17.759
The owner asked me if
I want to do a contest...

24:17.760 --> 24:19.439
I say, "No, I don't
want to do that because

24:19.440 --> 24:22.199
I don't like the
string in your ass!

24:24.120 --> 24:26.119
It's not my style.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.399
And he says,

24:27.400 --> 24:28.999
"it's not string in your ass.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.719
The name is posing
trunks, you know?"

24:31.720 --> 24:34.039
I say, "No, I don't like it."

24:34.040 --> 24:36.359
And he says, "I got
one option for you.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.319
You go on stage, and you win,

24:39.320 --> 24:41.119
you can train for
nothing, and I'll give you

24:41.120 --> 24:42.559
food and supplements."

24:42.560 --> 24:44.519
I say, "But I got one problem.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.959
I got nobody, you know?"

24:46.960 --> 24:50.919
Everybody told me to go
to that woman over there.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.039
Grandma.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.159
I say "Grandma?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.599
Are you crazy, man?

24:54.600 --> 24:57.799
Don't let me train
with a woman, man!"

24:57.800 --> 24:59.359
"Really, she's good, she's good.

24:59.360 --> 25:02.999
"She's one of the best, you know?"

25:03.000 --> 25:05.919
I give her hand, but I say,

25:05.920 --> 25:08.119
"Wow, you're a trainer?"

25:08.120 --> 25:09.959
I say, "Hey come on,
you can talk to me

25:09.960 --> 25:11.559
straight away, come on."

25:11.560 --> 25:16.199
And then, I find out that
he was very, very shy.

25:16.200 --> 25:22.039
In Holland, there was
an ugly word for him.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.519
"Look out, he's lazy.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.679
Lazy negro."

25:25.680 --> 25:27.102
I say, "Come on, guys!"

25:32.520 --> 25:35.319
I trained with him, he's
not lazy, the guy is...

25:35.320 --> 25:37.119
Go, go, go, go!

25:37.120 --> 25:38.799
He's like a machine.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.959
In the gym, he's a machine,
nobody can stop him.

25:41.960 --> 25:44.999
He is "The Beast."

25:45.000 --> 25:48.639
My dream is to make
a house for my mother.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.079
Before my father died,
my father wanted to buy

25:52.080 --> 25:54.039
a big house for her.

25:54.040 --> 25:57.199
But that's not happened.

25:57.200 --> 26:01.079
What my father promised
her, I make her.

26:01.080 --> 26:04.359
Tomorrow, in accordance
with the IFBB point system,

26:04.360 --> 26:06.679
Roelly must place first or second

26:06.680 --> 26:10.239
in order to qualify
for the Olympia stage.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.959
So Winklaar...

26:11.960 --> 26:13.159
Are you nervous
for the competition?

26:13.160 --> 26:14.639
No.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.599
You're always nervous
before a contest.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.879
It has to be you're nervous,
otherwise on stage, you're...

26:19.880 --> 26:21.919
No, I'm not nervous because...

26:21.920 --> 26:23.999
I know I'm gonna win, you know?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.159
Okay.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.399
Put down the telephone.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.799
You want to put it down?

26:28.800 --> 26:29.879
Put it down.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.959
You sure?

26:30.960 --> 26:32.639
Come on, we have to go to sleep!

26:32.640 --> 26:35.666
For a long time, I
have been tired, OK?

26:53.040 --> 26:56.039
Hidetada Yamagishi has
also yet to qualify.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.319
Hide must place in the top two

26:57.320 --> 26:58.519
in order to advance.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.119
If he didn't have a
tan, you wouldn't see

27:00.120 --> 27:01.639
his definition on stage,

27:01.640 --> 27:05.479
you wouldn't see his striations,
his vascularity, anything.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.799
He would just wash out
under the bright lights.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.239
You really gotta be dark
when you get on that stage.

27:10.240 --> 27:12.079
When the guys have to go on stage,

27:12.080 --> 27:15.999
and they go white on stage,

27:16.000 --> 27:18.679
their muscles look small.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.479
When you're painting up,

27:20.480 --> 27:21.919
you can see

27:21.920 --> 27:24.839
the muscles look very, very good.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.501
OK, bend over.

27:31.120 --> 27:35.181
When we are finished,
we are all brown.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.319
Seven.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.239
I got nine, Jason.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.679
Ten, Todd's here.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.279
I got 11, I got 12, I got 13.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.399
I got 14, I got 15.

28:21.400 --> 28:24.790
I'm missing 16, Shawn?

28:27.080 --> 28:28.999
The bodybuilder
takes the human form

28:29.000 --> 28:32.639
to its utmost visual extreme.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.119
The development of muscles

28:34.120 --> 28:36.079
isn't just a game of measurements.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.787
Perfect symmetry is
equally important.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.439
to our fourth-place finisher.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.679
Roelly Winklaar!

30:02.400 --> 30:03.679
The road to success

30:03.680 --> 30:08.279
isn't always straight
or clear in this sport.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.599
Another loss like Tampa
would mean months and years

30:10.600 --> 30:12.511
of training have been wasted.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.479
This means the loss of prize money

30:17.480 --> 30:20.199
and perhaps even a sponsor,

30:20.200 --> 30:22.941
the support line
for any bodybuilder.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.839
Lonely nights,
familiar hotel rooms,

30:45.840 --> 30:47.679
long-distance calls
are the only way

30:47.680 --> 30:49.545
to keep in touch with loved ones.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.679
At times when the
family can't be reached,

30:55.680 --> 30:58.639
the trainer is the
only person to talk to.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.159
Hey, bro, congratulations!

31:03.160 --> 31:05.999
Second place, and
Olympia qualification.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.999
I'm happy, and I'm
relieved, you know?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.759
Yeah, me too.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.359
I knew you were gonna do
it, but now it's official.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.399
So, we got six weeks to train hard.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.719
Alright.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.985
Okay, bro, keep in touch,
and thanks for calling.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.639
Roelly has trouble
sleeping most nights.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.959
Moments ago, he was told that he
has one more chance to qualify,

31:31.960 --> 31:34.959
but he'll have to travel back to
Europe to compete at the Nordic Pro.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.479
Winklaar.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.319
You OK?

31:38.320 --> 31:40.026
Yeah, Grandma.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.319
It's time for your food.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.707
Yes.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.879
Unless he places first,
his journey will end

31:55.880 --> 31:58.587
before it begins.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.399
Victor Martinez wasn't
always an inmate.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.239
He was a star,

32:11.240 --> 32:15.759
a star bodybuilder on his way
to conquer the Olympia title.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.559
He was incarcerated for
an immigration charge

32:18.560 --> 32:19.879
as a result of his arrest

32:19.880 --> 32:22.639
for a controlled
substance years ago.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.879
To actually be in
jail and want to live

32:25.880 --> 32:30.679
or think of outside, it
just makes it all difficult.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.919
I had to shut down,

32:32.920 --> 32:37.079
there's no making up,
it's lost time, that's it.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.264
I was disappearing.

32:40.640 --> 32:43.879
His stint in jail has left
him far behind his competitors.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.519
And mounting emotional
and financial problems

32:46.520 --> 32:49.399
won't make his return any easier.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.879
A six-month sentence is a
lifetime for a bodybuilder.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.639
You're at war right now,
with other competitors.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.119
And when you do what you have to do

33:02.120 --> 33:04.559
from now to the Mr. Olympia,

33:04.560 --> 33:06.919
you do what you have to do to win.

33:06.920 --> 33:10.439
And as long as you know you
did what you had to do to win,

33:10.440 --> 33:14.559
nobody can ever say anything
bad about you ever, ever.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.159
Because you know in your heart,

33:16.160 --> 33:17.639
you gave it your all.

33:17.640 --> 33:21.119
Coming back now, preparing
for the Olympia is...

33:21.120 --> 33:23.719
I don't have that
feeling like I'm ready.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.359
I can't say I walked in
and had the best workout.

33:26.360 --> 33:30.159
The first time I went
in, it was horrible.

33:30.160 --> 33:33.919
I'm touching the
weights, and it's...

33:33.920 --> 33:37.319
there's no connection, I
didn't really eat in there.

33:37.320 --> 33:40.119
Seven, 800 calories, most
of it was through bread

33:40.120 --> 33:45.679
and you know, junk
food, Snickers bars.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.079
I'd say right now,

33:47.080 --> 33:49.679
every workout I do is important.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.119
Between meals and training,

33:51.120 --> 33:52.839
between court-ordered
appointments,

33:52.840 --> 33:55.279
between his separation
from his girlfriend,

33:55.280 --> 33:59.359
between all these things, he
tries to maintain his sanity.

33:59.360 --> 34:03.839
He tries to find time to be
a father to his four children.

34:03.840 --> 34:07.639
Two boys, which are
autistic, and two young girls,

34:07.640 --> 34:10.599
all from different mothers

34:10.600 --> 34:13.839
I'm backed up on child support,
I still take care of my kids,

34:13.840 --> 34:17.799
but, they freeze your bank account,

34:17.800 --> 34:19.199
they suspend your license

34:19.199 --> 34:22.599
and yes, I'm driving
illegally right now.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.879
So what, what can you do, you know?

34:33.719 --> 34:36.985
Let's warm up, after
this, we gotta pick it up.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.958
I'm not mentally ready, it's...

34:41.960 --> 34:45.438
it's bothersome every single day.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.918
It's bothering because I'm
working on it every day,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.279
you know, preparing myself.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.399
Pick up your spirit, let's go.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.998
Come on, man!

34:54.000 --> 34:55.989
We gotta do this.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.547
Come on!

35:04.240 --> 35:07.119
Great set.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.559
I can't keep going like this.

35:08.560 --> 35:12.519
I gotta try to pick it up, man.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.959
I'm playing with the big boys, man.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.599
That's why we gotta push.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.784
You'll get back there again.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.799
Push it.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.559
That's it.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.199
Come on!

35:29.200 --> 35:30.667
You can do this.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.679
You're gonna do this, man.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.679
You gotta stay focused.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.399
I mean...

35:41.400 --> 35:43.839
You want to be on that
stage again, right?

35:43.840 --> 35:45.759
Yeah, of course.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.239
I strive on fear.

35:47.240 --> 35:51.359
If something scares
me, if I'm afraid of it,

35:51.360 --> 35:53.559
I always want to face it.

35:53.560 --> 35:58.439
My entire life is the
fricking stock market, man!

35:58.440 --> 36:01.511
Right now, I'm in a recession.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.279

36:19.800 --> 36:23.999
Dennis Wolf wanders through
the halls of NBC networks.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.959
This is a dream come
true for the bodybuilder

36:25.960 --> 36:27.919
from Germany.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.679
A moment of classic
American celebrity,

36:30.680 --> 36:33.919
an interview on the
nationalized television show.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.359
This is his time,

36:35.360 --> 36:38.199
his moment to grasp a hold of fame.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.119
Welcome back to
"The Morning Blend."

36:40.120 --> 36:43.039
They're fit, they're strong,
but there can only be one!

36:43.040 --> 36:45.119
The world's top
bodybuilders are competing

36:45.120 --> 36:47.759
to bring home the coveted
title of Mr. Olympia.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.599
I was a big fan of
Arnold Schwarzenegger,

36:49.600 --> 36:52.639
and bodybuilding, I
fell in love right away,

36:52.640 --> 36:54.319
when I walk out... you know,

36:54.320 --> 36:55.879
walk in for the first
time into the gym

36:55.880 --> 36:57.839
and that was my thing.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.679
People are going to
America to have success,

37:00.680 --> 37:03.439
the first six months was
hard because people are,

37:03.440 --> 37:06.239
"Oh, look at this
guy, he's probably just

37:06.240 --> 37:09.119
lifting weights and that's it.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.639
Dumb, stupid," because
people have no idea

37:11.640 --> 37:14.142
what is bodybuilding.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.119
You need someone who can push you,

37:17.120 --> 37:19.719
and it's not easy to find
someone who can push me,

37:19.720 --> 37:21.439
that's why I have Dennis.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.559
Your know, every time
we train together,

37:23.560 --> 37:26.039
he finish me, he's finishing me,

37:26.040 --> 37:30.239
and, you know, I'm sore for days.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.319
Come on, one more, come on!

37:31.320 --> 37:33.279
- Too big pump!
- Come on!

37:33.280 --> 37:36.239
That's what we're here for!

37:36.240 --> 37:38.999
We gonna pump the iron, come on!

37:39.000 --> 37:41.119
Slow, Dennis, slow, slow, slow.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.639
Slow!

37:43.640 --> 37:45.679
That's good and three...

37:45.680 --> 37:48.199
Let's go!

37:48.200 --> 37:51.319
Hup, hup, hup!

38:03.760 --> 38:07.159
Stand up and move around a little.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.027
You have to lose that
one, I'm really dizzy.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.224
Anybody ready to break dance?

38:19.840 --> 38:21.279
Almost drowned!

38:21.280 --> 38:24.999
Germany, with its cold
and oppressive rain

38:25.000 --> 38:29.679
stands in stark contrast
to Vegas' glaring sunshine.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.519
To him, America is the chance

38:31.520 --> 38:33.759
to become one of the greats.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.639
To become an Arnold.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.359
To become a star.

38:38.360 --> 38:42.119
Wolf's stepdaughter visits
him as often as she can.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.959
Their relationship
is as strong as iron,

38:44.960 --> 38:46.799
despite the lack of blood ties.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.559
I saw him every day.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.159
It's... yeah.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.799
I didn't think he's
big, it's normal for me,

38:54.800 --> 38:57.639
every day I saw him.

38:57.640 --> 39:00.479
Everybody should place
where they deserve.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.119
It's hard when you
have so many judges

39:02.120 --> 39:03.639
and you have so
many great athletes,

39:03.640 --> 39:05.079
where the standard is so close,

39:05.080 --> 39:07.599
you could throw a coin.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.599
You know, apples or
oranges, what do you like?

39:10.600 --> 39:13.159
You know, it is
that close sometimes,

39:13.160 --> 39:15.959
"He was great, wow, wow, wow."

39:15.960 --> 39:17.479
How do you judge?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.279
He has a better smile,
he has green eyes,

39:19.280 --> 39:21.279
he has blue eyes,
he has brown eyes.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.319
You know what I mean...
it's hard, it's not easy.

39:23.320 --> 39:27.359
Every muscle part must
be completely perfect.

39:27.360 --> 39:30.319
No weak points, we get
judged by weak points.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.399
If you don't have
the better symmetry,

39:33.400 --> 39:37.319
the better muscle
maturity, muscle quality,

39:37.320 --> 39:39.519
as Mr. Olympia, you don't win.

39:39.520 --> 39:43.119
Do the double biceps.

39:43.120 --> 39:47.839
Try to open up, pull up, pull up...

39:47.840 --> 39:51.025
And bend the wrists
back a little bit.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.199
"Oh, his hairstyle.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.799
He's gotta be gay,
there's something wrong.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.279
I just... somethings
wrong with that guy,

40:04.280 --> 40:06.639
he's just so different!

40:06.640 --> 40:08.319
You'll never be a champion.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.599
You might win a show but...

40:10.600 --> 40:13.079
you'll never be Mr. Olympia!"

40:16.720 --> 40:20.119
While others will
celebrate, you know,

40:20.120 --> 40:23.703
achieving master's and Ph.D.s...

40:25.680 --> 40:28.959
I won bodybuilding competitions.

40:28.960 --> 40:34.759
And now I stand here, at
the top of this experience,

40:34.760 --> 40:37.919
looking at winning the highest...

40:37.920 --> 40:41.026
title in the bodybuilding world.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.279
Turn your wrist in, pull it tight!

40:44.280 --> 40:46.639
Flex your hamstrings, pull tight!

40:46.640 --> 40:48.079
Pull.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.479
Pull.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.679
Pull it.

40:50.680 --> 40:51.839
Pull it!

40:51.840 --> 40:53.399
Roll it over a little more, Kai.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.039
There we go, pop
your hamstring out.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.479
Squeeze... all the way down!

40:57.480 --> 40:59.959
Bring this up... pull
tight, hamstring up a little.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.999
Posing is a very valuable
tool to build a physique,

41:03.000 --> 41:05.959
to build a physique
that is historically

41:05.960 --> 41:08.239
the physique that is bodybuilding.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.999
It's not just enough
to go to the gym,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.719
and just train, and lift weights.

41:13.720 --> 41:16.399
There's an internal connection

41:16.400 --> 41:20.479
with the contractions
that your muscles make.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.799
What I'm really talking about

41:21.800 --> 41:24.159
is the presence of
the artistic mind

41:24.160 --> 41:28.745
that ultimately
sculpts the physique.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.999
Lower your shoulders,
you're doing it wrong.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.479
Let's do it again.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.948
No, do it again.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.582
Suck it in...

41:42.440 --> 41:43.959
Legs, legs, legs.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.639
You're forgetting about your legs.

41:45.640 --> 41:49.919
People always tell me,
"Hey, he's looking tired.

41:49.920 --> 41:52.079
You let him do too much."

41:52.080 --> 41:55.679
But he's always up
late on the internet,

41:55.680 --> 41:58.159
coming in the gym
with a face like this.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.399
That makes me angry!

42:00.400 --> 42:01.679
It's not allowed.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.919
I respect you, you
have to respect me.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.679
Don't come with a face like this

42:06.680 --> 42:08.519
because you didn't sleep.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.719
Go to your bed, you have to rest.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.119
Let me know when you're finished.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.959
You need your energy on the stage,

42:13.960 --> 42:15.799
when you don't have
it on the stage,

42:15.800 --> 42:17.199
you can lose everything.

42:17.200 --> 42:18.759
- I know.
- In the off-season,

42:18.760 --> 42:22.150
do what you want, don't
do it in the competition!

42:33.680 --> 42:35.559
- What's up, champ?
- Dennis James,

42:35.560 --> 42:37.039
a retired bodybuilder, and mentor

42:37.040 --> 42:39.439
in the eyes of most athletes,

42:39.440 --> 42:41.679
doesn't sugarcoat criticism.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.319
From posing, to diet, to training,

42:44.320 --> 42:47.519
his astute eye can
identify any problem.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.719
So this time you have to
really, really go out there,

42:49.720 --> 42:52.679
and you have to nail it...
and I talked to a judge

42:52.680 --> 42:56.159
who said that you lose
two spots on his sheets

42:56.160 --> 42:58.559
because of the way you
pose, you know what I mean?

42:58.560 --> 42:59.919
So this is something
you can control.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.359
You can work on that.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.919
- You can show him.
- Yeah, of course.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.479
You're here, please help.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.439
Now pull it down, like
you do a lat pulldown,

43:06.440 --> 43:08.359
and now open up... there you go.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.679
See, now he has some
movement going on.

43:10.680 --> 43:14.599
The judge told me this
was not coming out,

43:14.600 --> 43:15.999
and that's why.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.279
You know how you bring that out?

43:17.280 --> 43:18.799
Just try this one time.

43:18.800 --> 43:22.959
Instead of going right
into something like this,

43:22.960 --> 43:27.719
try to go up, pull it down,

43:27.720 --> 43:29.199
then open up, 'cause
you create music.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.559
This is again what I'm saying,

43:30.560 --> 43:33.028
you move, eyes on you.

43:35.080 --> 43:38.079
Always start from the bottom,
legs, hamstrings, glutes.

43:38.080 --> 43:42.119
Now arms, all the way, straight up.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.679
Just like... that's
it, just like that!

43:44.680 --> 43:47.319
That's what I want him
to do, see the difference?

43:47.320 --> 43:48.919
- You see that?
- Yeah.

44:07.640 --> 44:10.159
Our third-place finalist,

44:10.160 --> 44:12.119
representing Germany, number two,

44:12.120 --> 44:15.239
Ronny Rockel.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.919
Let's take the
first runner-up award

44:17.920 --> 44:20.959
and present that to...

44:20.960 --> 44:22.519
by way of Poland, number eight,

44:22.520 --> 44:25.079
Robert Piotrkowicz.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.319
The first-place prize,

44:30.320 --> 44:33.959
and moving on to the
Mr. Olympia contest...

44:33.960 --> 44:36.279
Roelly Winklaar!

44:46.120 --> 44:48.439
- Finally!
- Finally!

44:48.440 --> 44:50.399
Nice job!

44:50.400 --> 44:52.559
This what we worked so hard for!

44:52.560 --> 44:54.599
Hey, finally...

44:54.600 --> 44:57.079
Finally, we made it through.

44:57.080 --> 44:58.159
Yes, finally.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.639
We are...

44:59.640 --> 45:01.079
up to the...

45:01.080 --> 45:03.309
- Mr. O.
- O, nice!

45:14.800 --> 45:16.039
The Martinez family moved

45:16.040 --> 45:17.559
to Washington Heights, New York,

45:17.560 --> 45:21.719
from the Dominican Republic
when Victor was six years old.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.559
He grew up in a house
with seven sisters,

45:23.560 --> 45:26.839
two brothers, an
overbearing mother,

45:26.840 --> 45:29.639
and a strict, unsupportive father.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.559
That lack of support
and understanding

45:31.560 --> 45:35.639
has plagued Victor's
ambitions his entire career.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.799
Getting smaller, man!

45:37.800 --> 45:40.599
What's up... you're
not working out, man!

45:40.600 --> 45:42.399
Trying to, I'm gonna
get to the gym, man.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.039
Good, good, good.

45:44.040 --> 45:46.199
Get me a ticket or
something, I'll go!

45:46.200 --> 45:49.863
Yeah, all right.

45:51.680 --> 45:56.439
In 2009, Victor's sister,
Iridania, was murdered.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.559
Iridania always
cooked meals for Victor

45:58.560 --> 46:00.519
before his competitions.

46:00.520 --> 46:03.944
Her absence affects
him to this day.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.679
You say "Daddy"?

46:07.680 --> 46:10.319
No... So you want ice cream?

46:10.320 --> 46:11.799
No?

46:11.800 --> 46:13.719
I know you want...

46:13.720 --> 46:14.799
Oh!

46:14.800 --> 46:16.839
What was that kiss for?

46:16.840 --> 46:18.639
That was all for me?

46:21.480 --> 46:23.519
Victor loves returning
to his old neighborhood,

46:23.520 --> 46:26.279
where everything seems so familiar.

46:26.280 --> 46:30.199
Familiar faces, familiar places.

46:30.200 --> 46:33.679
This is a place he will
always call home in his heart,

46:33.680 --> 46:35.399
mostly because of his daughter,

46:35.400 --> 46:37.759
who still resides
here with her mother.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.679
Quitting has not been a choice,

46:39.680 --> 46:42.999
only because I cannot see myself

46:43.000 --> 46:45.279
explaining this to my kids.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.639
Right now, I have to
provide for my family.

46:47.640 --> 46:51.030
I need bodybuilding to survive.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.479
- Goddamn!
- All right, bro.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.919
How are you doin', bro?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.279
Fast!

47:13.280 --> 47:14.839
Killing yourself
down here, already?

47:14.840 --> 47:16.159
Yeah, I have to, man.

47:16.160 --> 47:18.822
- The only way to go, bro!
- No doubt!

47:20.240 --> 47:22.079
I'm very proud of you, you hear me?

47:22.080 --> 47:25.199
God bless you, bro!

47:25.200 --> 47:28.719
My judgment day will be
seeing Steve Weinberger.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.159
Seeing the judge,
and him telling me

47:31.160 --> 47:34.959
if I'm ready for the
Olympia stage or not.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.959
Yeah, look at your hamstrings.

47:49.960 --> 47:51.879
I'm telling you, Victor,

47:51.880 --> 47:54.587
you have a lot of work to
do before you see Steve.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.439
Can I get two pounds?

48:07.440 --> 48:09.146
- Two pounds?
- Yes, sir.

48:12.440 --> 48:13.999
It's pretty intense.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.519
It's always intense.

48:15.520 --> 48:19.559
Somebody may ask you,
"Is it that serious?"

48:19.560 --> 48:21.239
It's always that serious.

48:21.240 --> 48:24.559
I'm a professional at what I do.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.599
I'm not a fan, I'm not a spectator,

48:26.600 --> 48:29.999
I'm not the person at home,
I'm the man living this.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.119
If I don't eat like this,

48:32.120 --> 48:35.079
I don't make conscious food choices

48:35.080 --> 48:38.079
when it's time to make them,

48:38.080 --> 48:39.919
every day, all day,

48:39.920 --> 48:43.359
then the goods won't be
there when I need them to be.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.719
This is the easy part.

48:45.720 --> 48:49.279
If you can't do the easy stuff,

48:49.280 --> 48:51.799
then what do you do
when life happens?

48:51.800 --> 48:54.439
Things will come and test you.

48:54.440 --> 48:56.919
A loved one goes to the hospital.

48:56.920 --> 48:59.879
It's abrupt.

48:59.880 --> 49:03.359
You feel obligated or compelled

49:03.360 --> 49:05.719
to want to be there.

49:05.720 --> 49:09.199
You still gotta be in the gym
at six o'clock in the morning.

49:09.200 --> 49:10.919
You still gotta start your meals,

49:10.920 --> 49:12.879
so for you to stay focused,

49:12.880 --> 49:16.159
it's not a sacrifice,
it has to be a lifestyle.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.279
When you're training
for the competition,

49:17.280 --> 49:18.519
it consumes your whole day...

49:18.520 --> 49:19.919
bodybuilders, by
definition, most of 'em

49:19.920 --> 49:21.639
will tell you are very
self-centered and selfish.

49:21.640 --> 49:24.439
Even if you're not that type of person,
you become that kind of person,

49:24.440 --> 49:25.799
because you never get away from it,

49:25.800 --> 49:28.399
because your nutrition,
when you're dieting,

49:28.400 --> 49:30.239
for Mr. Olympia, you can't eat out,

49:30.240 --> 49:31.839
because you have
to weigh your food,

49:31.840 --> 49:36.039
you have to have so many carbs,
so much protein, so much water...

49:36.040 --> 49:37.559
you have to control
what's in the food.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.639
- What you got?
- We got beef, chicken,

49:40.640 --> 49:43.279
turkey, beans,

49:43.280 --> 49:44.999
potato salad and coleslaw.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.039
Like a bunch of marinade
and things on it?

49:47.040 --> 49:48.399
Not it's just...

49:48.400 --> 49:50.599
salt.

49:50.600 --> 49:53.319
Cool, man.

49:53.320 --> 49:55.879
Damn, ain't gonna be
getting none of that today.

49:55.880 --> 49:59.679
You can eat seven, eight
times a day, like some people.

49:59.680 --> 50:01.879
I'm like, "Yeah, you gotta
eat a lot of clean food."

50:01.880 --> 50:03.679
And then the mom will
say, "Yeah, my son eats,

50:03.680 --> 50:06.799
he eats everything..."
yeah, he's eating everything.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.199
That's why he's not lean.

50:08.200 --> 50:09.759
Suppose to mix this in a drink,

50:09.760 --> 50:13.759
but goes down fine just
like this, so why not?

50:13.760 --> 50:16.319
Most other people,
they go to the store,

50:16.320 --> 50:17.679
they'll buy some product.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.359
They just...

50:19.360 --> 50:21.519
and hoping for the best.

50:21.520 --> 50:23.319
They don't know how
that actually works.

50:23.320 --> 50:26.239
They don't know the science
behind those supplements.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.039
They don't care, and
they're not supposed to,

50:28.040 --> 50:31.439
I get that... but, yeah,
we're the dumb-dumbs.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.039
We're the people that
don't know anything,

50:33.040 --> 50:34.999
but just bein' a box
of rocks with weights,

50:35.000 --> 50:36.759
and all this other stuff,
we're the meatheads,

50:36.760 --> 50:38.319
we're the idiots...
we're able to do something

50:38.320 --> 50:41.679
that 99.8 percent of the
people on the Earth can do,

50:41.680 --> 50:44.079
which is lose fat

50:44.080 --> 50:45.879
and gain muscle, at the same time.

50:45.880 --> 50:48.679
They don't know that
we eat seven, eight,

50:48.680 --> 50:51.279
nine thousand calories a day.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.679
They don't know
that we're in the gym

50:52.680 --> 50:56.079
two, three times a
day, six days a week.

50:56.080 --> 51:00.279
Right away, they want to
just diminish your work.

51:00.280 --> 51:03.119
By going to that one little
thing and brush it off,

51:03.120 --> 51:06.145
they're saying, "You know what, it's
because they're taking steroids."

51:13.040 --> 51:14.679
The overall perception
of steroids, obviously,

51:14.680 --> 51:18.799
is something that
cheaters only use.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.759
We are realizing now that
the truth of the matter

51:21.760 --> 51:25.759
is any athlete at the professional

51:25.760 --> 51:28.679
or world-class level...

51:28.680 --> 51:31.599
is likely using some form

51:31.600 --> 51:36.439
of performance-enhancing drugs.

51:36.440 --> 51:38.559
Anabolic steroids don't make

51:38.560 --> 51:41.959
what professional
bodybuilders do easier.

51:41.960 --> 51:45.759
It simply allows them to
take it to that extreme level.

51:45.760 --> 51:49.239
Anabolic steroids are
basically testosterone,

51:49.240 --> 51:51.759
or testosterone derivatives.

51:51.760 --> 51:55.399
So in the body, when you
take a synthetic form,

51:55.400 --> 51:58.359
it basically gets
into the muscle cell,

51:58.360 --> 52:01.479
attaches to receptors
that are in that cell,

52:01.480 --> 52:05.519
and then that turns on
genes in the muscle cell

52:05.520 --> 52:07.039
that produce more protein.

52:07.040 --> 52:10.639
That's the way it
enhances muscle size.

52:10.640 --> 52:14.039
Many of the athletes simply
refuse to talk on the subject.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.639
It's taboo.

52:15.640 --> 52:18.079
Others are willing to
engage in the conversation.

52:18.080 --> 52:20.264
Because people...

52:22.200 --> 52:25.599
take too much of this stuff,

52:25.600 --> 52:27.919
and don't know how to use it,

52:27.920 --> 52:30.359
that gives bodybuilding
a bad, bad name.

52:30.360 --> 52:34.319
The media likes to portray
it as being very sensational

52:34.320 --> 52:37.559
but steroids aren't addictive,
steroids never killed anybody.

52:37.560 --> 52:39.839
There's no physiological
proof, it's never been shown,

52:39.840 --> 52:41.759
it's all what the
media wants you to see.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.399
Society's reaction to steroids

52:43.400 --> 52:46.239
is often hypocritical
and judgmental.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.079
I think it's a
contradiction, to be honest,

52:48.080 --> 52:50.079
'cause most
bodybuilders that I know

52:50.080 --> 52:52.959
and that I've met are on steroids,

52:52.960 --> 52:55.959
or have done steroids,
and for somebody who wants

52:55.960 --> 52:58.719
to portray themselves as
a fit and healthy person,

52:58.720 --> 53:00.679
that's not at all healthy.

53:00.680 --> 53:03.799
People go, "Ahh, steroids," man...

53:03.800 --> 53:04.879
Nobody can do that.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.679
Like, it's not easy to do.

53:06.680 --> 53:08.159
People don't respect it,
they go, "Oh, I can do that

53:08.160 --> 53:10.639
with steroids," no, you couldn't.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.119
You couldn't do what I do!

53:12.120 --> 53:15.039
They come to the gym,
never did a workout,

53:15.040 --> 53:16.719
and then they find
on the internet...

53:16.720 --> 53:20.199
steroids... they sell
steroids on the internet.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.943
Children, 15, 16 years
old, they order it...

53:25.960 --> 53:28.639
That's what I hate... it's
dangerous, very dangerous.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.439
If you do something extreme,

53:30.440 --> 53:34.879
you can't be healthy,
you gotta take some risks.

53:34.880 --> 53:38.159
So it's like, you
know, like racing...

53:38.160 --> 53:41.199
if you go Formula
One, you take the risk.

53:41.200 --> 53:46.199
Any time that you're using
performance enhancers,

53:46.200 --> 53:48.839
particularly when we haven't
studied them in the lab,

53:48.840 --> 53:50.839
to the level that they can be used,

53:50.840 --> 53:53.159
certainly, there can be
negative side effects.

53:53.160 --> 53:57.239
There is issues with kidney damage,

53:57.240 --> 53:59.079
there is, what we do know,

53:59.080 --> 54:02.039
is that the heart size increases

54:02.040 --> 54:06.279
because the heart is a
muscle, there's liver issues,

54:06.280 --> 54:09.639
it's quite toxic,
especially the oral drugs,

54:09.640 --> 54:13.959
that's why injectables are
one of the preferred drugs

54:13.960 --> 54:17.759
for minimizing health risks.

54:17.760 --> 54:21.039
I think the best answer
is to allow the athletes

54:21.040 --> 54:25.279
to use the drugs, but
provide medical treatment.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.519
Get a group of very
competitive athletes together,

54:27.520 --> 54:29.919
everyone wants to win,
you've got large sums of money

54:29.920 --> 54:31.679
up for grabs, guys are going to do

54:31.680 --> 54:33.159
whatever it takes to win.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.079
The bodybuilders and
the professional sport

54:35.080 --> 54:38.999
of bodybuilding has
gone the next step.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.599
Where all of a sudden,
the body does not look

54:41.600 --> 54:45.279
as acceptable, simply
because it's too big,

54:45.280 --> 54:48.599
and it doesn't have
any talent behind it.

54:48.600 --> 54:53.479
And the neck is 23 inches
and the calves are 18.

54:53.480 --> 54:55.439
The proportion is gone.

54:55.440 --> 54:57.839
The audience wants
to see a spectacle.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.959
When they go to see a
show, they don't want to see

54:59.960 --> 55:01.719
someone that looks like them,

55:01.720 --> 55:03.799
they want to see something extreme.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.119
So we have to get huge.

55:06.120 --> 55:07.639
We have to go to the next level.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.519
You know, is there
a limit to growth?

55:09.520 --> 55:10.639
Certainly, there's a limit,

55:10.640 --> 55:12.639
but I don't know that we found it.

55:12.640 --> 55:16.039
They ask the Olympic athletes,
if you could take a drug,

55:16.040 --> 55:18.759
right now, that would
kill you in five years,

55:18.760 --> 55:21.319
but guarantee you a gold
medal, would you take it?

55:21.320 --> 55:24.159
More than 50 percent said "Yes!"

55:24.160 --> 55:26.959
They would take it, even knowing it
would kill them five years later.

55:26.960 --> 55:30.199
This is what these athletes do.

55:30.200 --> 55:31.919
This this their lives.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.239
This is their livelihood,
this is how they make money.

55:34.240 --> 55:35.879
This is everything they know.

55:35.880 --> 55:39.839
Do you really think you're
gonna convince them to stop?

55:39.840 --> 55:42.239
As time progresses, the
science of bodybuilding

55:42.240 --> 55:45.999
advances faster and
faster, and with it,

55:46.000 --> 55:48.628
the size of the muscles.

55:52.080 --> 55:54.628
One more major title this year.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.079
One down.

55:57.080 --> 55:58.559
One to go!

55:58.560 --> 56:01.799
Three, four, five, six...

56:01.800 --> 56:03.039
Come on, one way!

56:03.040 --> 56:05.839
Eight, nine...

56:05.840 --> 56:08.639
Ten!

56:08.640 --> 56:11.279
Every rep count!

56:11.280 --> 56:13.999
Every rep, come on!

56:14.000 --> 56:16.119
Bring the pain!

56:16.120 --> 56:19.908
- Six, seven, eight, nine...
- Fight it!

56:21.480 --> 56:23.279
My physique that I bring
to the Olympia this year...

56:23.280 --> 56:24.959
it's not the product of
three months of hard work,

56:24.960 --> 56:28.191
it's the product of over
20 years of hard work.

56:34.280 --> 56:36.519
I thought I'd be retired
by now, originally.

56:36.520 --> 56:39.759
I thought by 36, 35-36, I'd be...

56:39.760 --> 56:42.319
I'd be retired, but...

56:42.320 --> 56:43.839
You know, I think I've
had so many injuries,

56:43.840 --> 56:46.279
I've had four significant injuries,

56:46.280 --> 56:47.719
since I've been pro,

56:47.720 --> 56:50.079
and I think that set me back.

56:50.080 --> 56:52.719
When you work out, do you
feel sore the next day?

56:52.720 --> 56:55.119
You rebuild pretty
quickly, right, I mean...

56:55.120 --> 56:57.039
Yeah, man, I get sore as fuck.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.559
I think when people say
they don't get sore, man,

56:58.560 --> 57:00.399
that's 'cause they're
not continually

57:00.400 --> 57:02.239
pushing their limits, you know?

57:02.240 --> 57:04.319
If you push it as hard as
you can push it every day,

57:04.320 --> 57:07.439
and you don't go to failure
and go beyond what you've done,

57:07.440 --> 57:09.079
then you're gonna get sore.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.839
Guys like Ronnie, they
got bigger every year.

57:10.840 --> 57:12.439
Dorian, you know, all
those guys that are trained

57:12.440 --> 57:16.079
to annihilate the muscle, you know,

57:16.080 --> 57:17.639
they came in bigger
and better every year.

57:17.640 --> 57:20.347
So, that's the difference.

57:22.480 --> 57:24.199
Due to injuries, Branch had to skip

57:24.200 --> 57:27.159
the 2010 and 2011 Olympias.

57:27.160 --> 57:31.187
Despite this, he continues to
live his life to the fullest.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.999
Branch, a few competitors said
that, "if you're gonna keep

57:35.000 --> 57:36.639
working out the way
you're doing at the gym,

57:36.640 --> 57:38.959
you're going to get injured
before the big competition."

57:38.960 --> 57:41.119
What do you think about that?

57:41.120 --> 57:43.879
They're entitled to their opinion.

57:43.880 --> 57:47.799
But, you know, I can
imagine who that was,

57:47.800 --> 57:50.639
and they ain't gonna
beat me anyway, so...

57:50.640 --> 57:53.239
they don't really matter.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.399
And the thing is, the
past two injuries I've had

57:55.400 --> 57:57.599
weren't in the gym, they
were outside the gym.

57:57.600 --> 58:01.279
So, I haven't been
hurt in the gym since...

58:01.280 --> 58:02.879
2003.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.461
C'mon.

58:05.960 --> 58:07.950
Let's go!

58:13.800 --> 58:14.879
Oh!

58:14.880 --> 58:16.079
Goddamn!

58:16.080 --> 58:18.279
Ouch!

58:18.280 --> 58:20.862
Son of a bitch!

58:25.000 --> 58:26.679
Goddamn, guys.

58:26.680 --> 58:29.159
The filming stops.

58:29.160 --> 58:31.119
Branch's hamstring is injured.

58:31.120 --> 58:33.987
His future at the
Olympia is now uncertain.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.759
I just know that the end
of a bodybuilding career

58:38.760 --> 58:41.439
is one injury away... one
major injury and you're toast.

58:41.440 --> 58:44.199
No matter how hard you work,
and how perfect you are,

58:44.200 --> 58:46.159
one injury and you're done.

58:46.160 --> 58:48.559
The days of being in the dungeon,

58:48.560 --> 58:50.959
training with your hoodie on,

58:50.960 --> 58:54.319
you know, "grunt and
cuss" bodybuilder,

58:54.320 --> 58:57.359
that eats, sleeps and trains...
that's all he does... are over.

58:57.360 --> 59:00.039
You have to be able
to do other things.

59:00.040 --> 59:02.279
I'm more focused now on my career,

59:02.280 --> 59:05.999
but of course I think
about the years after it

59:06.000 --> 59:07.719
because, I don't want to be like,

59:07.720 --> 59:10.559
"Okay, now it is over,
so let's think about

59:10.560 --> 59:12.119
what I can do now."

59:12.120 --> 59:15.919
Of course, it would be
nice if I could get some

59:15.920 --> 59:19.279
roles in the movies,
things like this.

59:19.280 --> 59:23.759
I just got a call
for a casting tomorrow

59:23.760 --> 59:27.279
for an action film, so we'll see...

59:27.280 --> 59:28.719
They're gonna fly me in...

59:28.720 --> 59:31.359
The movie star!

59:31.360 --> 59:32.559
...with a private jet.

59:32.560 --> 59:34.959
I don't want to waste my time

59:34.960 --> 59:36.959
trying to be an actor or something,

59:36.960 --> 59:38.759
if I don't have
the talent for this.

59:38.760 --> 59:41.359
There some that
have the personality.

59:41.360 --> 59:44.159
When I started doing
interviews in the '70s,

59:44.160 --> 59:46.799
the media always said,
"Finally there's someone

59:46.800 --> 59:48.839
that loves to talk
about the sport,"

59:48.840 --> 59:50.639
because for years we
tried to get interviews

59:50.640 --> 59:53.359
and everyone just said,
"No, I'm not going to talk,"

59:53.360 --> 59:55.999
because they were
always shy characters,

59:56.000 --> 59:58.919
and they'd rather live
in a dungeon and work out,

59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.519
and were very impressive,
but they didn't want to talk,

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.719
they felt too shy about it.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.199
All these guys say they
want to be like Arnold,

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.199
and be in the movies,
and stuff like that.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.559
Sometimes, it's like pulling teeth

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.679
to get these guys to talk.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.439
So, imagine giving them a script

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.351
they actually have to read.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.079
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.159
How you doing... oh!

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.959
Dennis, nice to meet you.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.919
So, Emilio Ferrari is
directing this movie,

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.239
and we're gonna start
shooting it in October,

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.039
but it is a comedy,
and it's kinda like

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.199
"Private Benjamin"
meets "Legally Blonde."

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.839
So we can have fun with this,

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.399
and if you want to
try something new,

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.719
or have improv or anything,

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.861
don't feel that you
can't do that, okay?

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.319
- So, you are reading for Robert.
- Robert, right.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.359
Hello, I'm Robert...

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.919
Hello, I'm Robert Starkey.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.742
Wow, you really love this country.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.679
- So, here's what...
- Uh... the United States.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.919
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.639
Let's try it again,
now there are some parts

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.279
where you are
coughing and mumbling,

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.279
you know like, you're...

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.999
So play that a little bit.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.879
Hello, I'm Robert Starkey.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.079
If you sign this right
now, I can't guarantee it...

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.159
I can't guarantee,
by this time tomorrow

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.679
you will be in sunny Puerto Rico.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.759
That was really good and
we're probably gonna have

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.159
callbacks, which I'm
gonna bring you back

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.759
to the director,
and that was funny.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.639
So just take it and work on it,

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.279
and we'll see each other later.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.279
Thank you very much, it was great.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.519
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.465
- Thank you.
- All right, take care.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.799
While playing
basketball in college,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.079
Phil realized that he would
never play professionally,

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.839
but there was
potential in his genes,

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.079
potential that led
him to another sport.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.319
That's right.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.799
I would say quitting
basketball, I mean...

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.839
It wasn't really
quitting, I'll be honest,

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.119
I just wasn't good enough
to play at the next level.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.399
Those dreams, as far as
like, playing in the NBA,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.159
were just... they were squashed.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.159
- This is Phil Heath.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.025
Good to meet you.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.639
At times, nostalgia kicks in.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.079
He loved to play ball just as much

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.039
as he loves bodybuilding now.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.719
When the opportunity
presents itself,

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.439
Phil enjoys to return to the court

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.159
to shoot some hoops.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.039
When I decided to be a
bodybuilder and quit basketball,

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.439
I actually marked down the date,

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.359
it was October 8th, 2002,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.679
and then the rest is history...
I got bit by that bug,

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.159
and it was an amazing
feeling to know that,

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.359
coming from a team sport...

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.959
You know, you're
being more concerned

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.239
with not just yourself, but
your teammates all the time,

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.999
and going against a
different type of opposition.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.559
Playing basketball, as
opposed to bodybuilding,

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.142
where it's really
all about my effort.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.799
Pittsburgh, a city
with more than blood

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.679
running through its veins.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:37.599
Sweat, steel, and hard work
pulse at its heart as well.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.839
It's home to Jim
Manion, the president

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.479
of the International Federation
of Bodybuilding & Fitness Pro.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.879
The chairman of the
National Physique Committee,

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.799
Jim acts as a father
of sorts to many

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.319
of the greatest bodybuilders,
Phil Heath among them.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.919
You're on the road so much
because you're so popular,

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.839
where the other guys
that are chasing you,

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.679
they're not getting as
many guest appearances,

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.079
store appearances from
the sponsors, et cetera.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.439
So they're at home training
where they're comfortable.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.679
Different priorities take
over in your life too.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.119
Your family, you want to spend
more time with your family.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.599
You know, they're ticked off.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.519
I don't have any children
of my own, you know,

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.319
but like, my wife and I, we talk about
it and it's like, what's gonna happen?

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.359
You know, I have a
stepson, but he's old enough

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.759
to fend for himself.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.439
But I can already tell,
just by having two dogs

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:28.239
that the minute I'm gone,
they tear everything up.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.079
See this?

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.559
Touch this.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.919
Whoa!

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.199
Say, "I'm bigger than you."

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.399
Show him yours.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.639
All right, Phil, I'm not gonna give you
any advice you don't already know.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.079
We talked already about bringing the
same condition you did last year.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.519
Everybody's gonna be chasing you

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.359
so you don't have to
worry about getting bigger

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.679
than this guy or
smaller than that guy.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.719
So, just kinda go back
and do what you do.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.079
Yeah, I don't have
to reinvent the wheel.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.999
Bring it again and
hope for the best.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.119
For me, as Mr. Olympia,
it's not about beating

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.879
your competition, it's
about crushing those dreams

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.839
of those other guys... and
that's what I've got to do,

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.944
I've gotta crush their dreams.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.439
It's a gloomy afternoon.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:11.799
Victor travels to the
Bev Francis Powerhouse Gym

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.879
in Syosset, New
York, to see a legend,

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.799
his mentor, Steve Weinberger.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.999
Today is his judgment day.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.639
- Hey, what's goin' on, brother?
- 'Sup, Steve?

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.439
- How you doin'?
- Good, good, how you doin'?

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.639
I'm okay, how you feel?

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.919
I'm okay, I've felt better.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.319
Yeah... how's it coming along?

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.399
I don't feel confident.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.879
Let me close the door...
too much noise out there.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.599
As soon as I got out,
I started training,

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.039
and getting back on my regimen...
the training's been good,

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.519
everything's been good, no
injuries, you know, and, uh...

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.399
Everything's good, it's
just, is it "Olympia good"?

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.279
Is it "Olympia ready"?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.942
- Let's see what you look like.
- All right.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.519
For Rikers Island,
you look great, Vic,

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.719
but for the Olympia...

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.399
I don't think you'll have enough
time, honestly, I'm sorry.

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.999
If I was you, I would shut it down,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.359
and just concentrate on next year.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.346
I don't think there's
enough time, I'm sorry.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.479
How you feelin', Victor?

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.039
I just don't want
to talk, right now.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.319
Please, c'mon.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.599
Hey, V.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.199
Yeah, I just saw Steve.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:47.919
Yeah, I decided I'm
not doing the show.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.639
He's a guy that's gotten no breaks, with
his sister getting murdered, and...

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.439
this is his second
time in jail, and...

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.799
just all these problems,
it just seems that...

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.919
You never know why some good people

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.999
never get breaks,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.679
and some bad people get breaks.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.799
And Victor is one of those good
guys that never get a break,

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.144
and I feel bad for
him, I really do.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.159
Hide lives a solitary
life in Venice, California,

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.999
near the beach.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.519
When he looks across the water,

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.439
he sometimes imagines
he can see home.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.239
Though he is married, he
spends most of his time

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:35.439
separate from his wife,
who often travels to Japan

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.839
to take care of his family...
a family that has never fully

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:43.159
accepted his life path,
nor fully understood it.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.719
They don't watch my shows,

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:48.599
but they call me and I call them.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.919
It's a really hard sport.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:58.187
For me, my thinking is that
they can't enjoy their life.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.879
I was born, born to be bodybuilder.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.439
I'm a bodybuilder until I die.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.279
I hope that one day
my family understands.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.199
People thought that
it's just impossible

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.038
for Japanese or Asian people

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.907
to step on Olympia stage...

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.399
Because of their structure
or genetics, I don't know...

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:28.599
I wouldn't say I'm
small 'cause I'm 5'5".

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.399
But I weigh 220,
which is pretty heavy.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:33.519
Olympia.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.118
Nice... are you gonna win?

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.879
- Say yes.
- Yeah, I will.

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.078
Yeah, say "I'm gonna
win the Olympia!"

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.866
Yes I will.

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:54.479
Come on.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.359
- You do a couple negative?

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:58.879
Do a couple negative,
hold it, resist me, resist.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.078
Resist, let's go.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.479
Let's go, come on, man!

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:04.078
Good job, Hide, come on, come on!

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.319
All the way down, all the way down.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:06.759
All the way down, and up.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.959
One more.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.799
Hold it. Resist me.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.879
Resist!

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.078
Come on!

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.519
Let's go.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.559
All the way down.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:18.439
I mean, the whole
game is about quality.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:20.270
This is the way you are.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.519
Most of them, no
disrespect, but some of 'em,

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.198
they don't follow that elegance.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.118
I see your moves
are really artistic

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.279
and I think that's what
bodybuilding is all about,

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:35.158
being an artist.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.546
Let's see.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.799
Unreal, just keep it like...

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.439
careful.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.238
Beautiful.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:51.319
Exhale.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:53.799
When you hit it, exhale.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.039
Then all that detail
right in the middle.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.639
Right, good.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.919
See?

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.919
Looks like the base is good

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.959
and everything flows.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.119
If you don't see
it in your mind eye,

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.199
you can just forget it.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.479
You got to believe.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.279
I know for sure that
Hide does believe.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.799
And I mean, we're not pretending.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.399
I mean, look at this guy.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.919
He's just amazing.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.519
So, I really used
to dream about this.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.599
When I came out here, I mean,
I had some people saying,

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.039
like, "You're not gonna win
the Olympia, are you crazy?

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.839
No way, this is impossible."

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.599
It's not impossible.
Everything is possible.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.759
Here you got a guy from
the Middle East region,

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.599
and not to brag about
it, I'm the only one

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.559
from that part of the
world to win the title,

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.239
and you got Hide from the Far East.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.759
I tell you, he's this
close, he's this close.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.039
I challenge you to
win the Olympia, man.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.599
Come on.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.119
I'm still, you know,
challenging the title.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.228
If I'm a champion, I would say
there will be a lot of pressure.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.519
There's always that pressure...
you gotta be your best,

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.119
'cause you're only as good as your
last contest, in our sport...

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.279
No matter how well you placed at the
last show, if you do poorly at this one,

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.839
this is the one
everybody remembers...

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.439
I think that's why
a lot of guys fail,

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.039
is because there's
so much pressure.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.319
Sponsors drop you.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.439
I better be ready, you know.
I better be ready to bring it.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.519
Here we go!

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.599
Fight!

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.679
Perfect!

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.799
Make 'em grow!

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.159
Here we go.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.439
No pain, no pain.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.519
Fight!

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.719
That's it!

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.479
You got this, man, no pain!

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.199
As a competition looms
in the near future,

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.959
the pressure builds.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.959
Training and rigorous routines
take a toll on the body,

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.519
as well on the mind.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.719
Each bodybuilder seeks
out different ways

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.382
to alleviate the stress.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.159
You know what you're getting?

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.839
I'm gonna get a sushi
and sashimi combo.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.279
I need no avocado,
and no fake crab.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.839
I'm gonna do the
spicy teriyaki chicken.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.159
And can I add extra chicken
to that, or double chicken?

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.879
And then I wanna do the TWT roll

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.319
and plus the titty roll.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.199
Okay, thank you very much.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.279
The what roll?

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.439
Titty.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.399
- Titi.
- Oh, titi, sorry.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.999
I'll take this outta your way.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.399
So how clean you... we gotta
keep it real tight tonight.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.359
Oh yeah, oh yeah, man.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.999
That's one of the
things I find separates

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.319
the good bodybuilders from the
great bodybuilders is an appetite.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.759
I'm not sure why, I
haven't figured it out,

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.599
maybe it's just the sheer
amount of calories they get in,

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.439
but the best
bodybuilders in the world

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.279
eat a lot of food.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.479
Right now, I'm about 4,000,

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.279
off season I try to get in 7,000.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.559
Like, if you wanna just
grow, you can go up eight

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.039
to ten thousand, as long as
you're training hard enough.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.879
I think a lot of bodybuilders
are apt to getting discouraged

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.639
and what not 'cause I
think a lot of us have

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.479
a little bit of muscle dysmorphia.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:47.719
You know, never big enough,

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.439
you're never lean enough.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.479
Think about the people that
are drawn to bodybuilding.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.839
You always got some type of...
either you're really skinny

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.359
as a kid or you got picked on.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.959
You got some type
of body image issues.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.639
Yeah, great point.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.759
What day you coming to Vegas?

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.119
Thursday.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.359
If you need me to bring anything out
there, if you need anything on my end,

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.359
you know, especially during
the two days before the show

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.839
or the day of the show.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.159
I'm actually expecting
to probably have

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.519
at least 50, probably 70 of
my close friends at the show.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.079
Like, people who have
been my biggest supports

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.919
since I even started competing.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.679
I think the place is gonna go nuts for me,
man, and that just lifts you on stage.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.079
Just stay relentless, bro, rig ht?

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.159
Stay hungry.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.719
As long as you keep focused.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.439
Like, right now, never
been so focused in my life.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.279
If I can continue with
this for the next...

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.679
until the Olympia, I'm
gonna be, by far, my best.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.439
And then if I can continue
with this type of focus

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.159
until next year, I'll
be unbeatable, man.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.839
I really believe that
I'll bring a package

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.990
that nobody can touch.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.119
Is there anybody
that you're worried

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.799
about competing against?

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.279
There's probably two guys
in the world who, I think,

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.559
if they bring their best, and I
bring my best, they can beat me.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.239
Other than that,
nobody's gonna beat me,

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.639
so I just gotta come with my best.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.559
I want everybody to
bring their A game,

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.479
and if somebody beats
me, I'll shake his hand,

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.790
'cause he outworked me, but
I don't see it happening.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.839
I met Phil at a mutual
friend's restaurant

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.759
after his second
bodybuilding competition,

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.759
that he won his class, but
he didn't take the overall.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.879
And I just knew,
like, I just saw the...

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.759
what he was working for, that
he was gonna become great,

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.559
and that everything
was gonna go for him.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.279
And he's like "Really...
you really think I'm gonna

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.999
make it that big?" and
I said, "Absolutely,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.719
I think you're gonna
go all the way."

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:48.639
I'm glad I have a
family that can go

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.679
on this journey with me, I'm not going at
this separate, and them just watching.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.159
They're there.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.119
They'll be there.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.439
I'll have the list for
tickets for you by tomorrow.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.759
Did you spell my name right?

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.959
I'm just kidding.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.799
So here's the thing
with Phil and I,

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.519
we always got along, man...
I've never had a problem

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.359
with him... I was
in Denver last year,

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.279
we went out to dinner,
and then I leave,

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.799
and I hear he was talking
shit... and I was like,

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.039
"Okay, you're a scumbag...
you say one thing in my face

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.919
and something else to
my back," that's fine.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.719
And to me, that says he's
insecure and he's scared.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.599
I don't respect his work ethic.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.839
I don't respect him as a
person, with his attitude.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.199
But he's become an
excellent bodybuilder.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.399
He's not a very good
role model for the sport.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:32.039
Is he as dominant as
everybody thinks he is?

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.719
No, he's not... but I've
seen him train and I'm like,

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.079
"Man, his back sucks,
his calves suck,

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.079
his hamstrings suck,"
man, that stuff,

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.279
you fix it like this, like, I can't build
muscle nearly as easily as that guy,

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.639
and yet I'm doing it, you know?

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.541
It ain't all talk when
you're on that stage, man.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.319
Phil Heath has had a lot of gifts.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.679
He's a gift, he's "The Gift."

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.959
I don't represent
gifts, I really don't.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.759
He's had a lot of
help, a lot of help.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.639
It's not like I had people
handing me money and stuff.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.639
When I first came into this sport,
I was working two jobs, unlike him.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.279
I don't even know
if he has a resume...

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.999
I don't even know if
he knows what that is.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.279
Easy, easy.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.239
Guess what, Kai?

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.559
You've been bodybuilding
for 20 years.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.079
I'm already better than you.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:30.639
You know it, but now you're making an
excuse, saying, "He got this, he got that."

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.199
Each man's body
will represent years

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.068
of focus and concentration.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.503
It'll be a great event.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.999
You're one injury away
from your career being over.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.919
I've fought too hard
to get where I'm at,

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.599
to slide back down.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.519
I'm not one to lay
down and cry about it.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.679
I'm gonna take this
thing by the horns,

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.639
I'm gonna overcome it... I'm
doing everything I can do,

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.666
man, I'm 100 percent.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.559
Have a dream.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.559
Everybody need to have a dream.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:11.347
Have a dream and go after
it with everything you got.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.319
Time to make Phil look
small, bro. Come on!

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.439
Make 'em all look small.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.862
Yup.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.759
They're gonna announce my
name, crowd's gonna go crazy,

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.999
I'm gonna hit my front
double bicep, this and that.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.519
Crowd's gonna go,

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:44.039
"Whoa!"

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.919
And I'm gonna just...

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.839
I'm gonna feel...

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:51.439
like a true Adonis,
man, like a god.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.868
But this trophy is mine.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.119
Come on, take your shirt off.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.519
Yo, who do you think
was the best ever?

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.599
Best ever?

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.679
Arnold or Lee?

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:46.759
Arnold.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.959
Arnold was better than Lee Haney?

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:50.399
Of course.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.519
That's a big statement
to say on camera!

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.319
How many, how many
Olympias has Arnold got?

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.399
Seven.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.479
How many Lee got?

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.719
- Eight.
- Eight.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.039
So who will be better?

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.119
Arnold, still Arnold!

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.839
Hold on, wait a
minute, so we go back...

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.719
Then you gotta go with what
century you was in or what...

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.199
It doesn't matter how
many Olympias he won.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.279
It doesn't matter?

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.359
Doesn't matter.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.799
Who's had the best, what year...

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.319
Who had the best chill body ever?

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.439
Ronnie Coleman.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.759
Ronnie Coleman?

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.519
He was a good one.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.719
All right, big...
hold on, one thing!

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:21.799
Let's arm wrestle.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:23.119
You lost!

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.399
Oh!

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:35.959
Olympia, a plain in Greece
in the western Peloponnese.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.159
The ancient Olympic Games
were said to be played

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.399
on this stretch of ground,

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.999
and it held the chief sanctuary
of the supreme god, Zeus.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.159
Now on a stage in
Vegas, the supreme man,

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.185
Mr. Olympia, will be crowned.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.399
When I go back and I
think of the Olympia,

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.679
I go back and I think
of Arnold Schwarzenegger,

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.439
when the first prize
money was $1,000.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.079
And then today, in
the 48th Olympia,

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.599
we're hoping to
give out prize money

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.159
of one million dollars.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.319
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.359
Welcome to Joe
Weider's Olympia fitness

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.989
and performance weekend 2012!

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.999
Just before the competition,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.639
the contenders begin their
pre-show preparations.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.639
The most agonizing is
dropping their water weight.

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.879
We always need to lose
a little bit of water

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.799
in the last couple of
hours before the show

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.319
because on stage,
with all those lights

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:46.959
and the tan and the oil, you
still look a little watery.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.079
If you lose the water,
it makes you look

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.639
on stage much, much dryer
because all the cuts,

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.599
all the separation, coming through

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:56.239
more and more, you know?

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.759
Now I'll introduce
the 19 competitors here

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.399
to vie for the
title of Mr. Olympia.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.479
Before Olympia, a
press conference is held

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.199
for the contenders.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.399
For the first time,
but not the last,

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.265
they are on stage together.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:27.599
What do you think about people
saying Phil can't be beat

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.559
at this year's
Olympia tomorrow night?

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.399
I don't give a damn
about what people say.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:42.639
I think I'm a better
poser than Branch.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.519
Well, I think I'm a better
bodybuilder than Dennis.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.159
This is a bodybuilding contest,
not a dance contest, baby.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.719
Going into tomorrow night,

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.799
I'm crossing my
fingers, praying to God

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.959
that I can be at my
best, because my best

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.159
will be good enough
to win another Sandow.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.359
No question.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.799
I'm happy I'm here,
I worked hard for it.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.279
You'll see the best package
you've ever seen tomorrow night.

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:17.439
If you and Phil Heath are
100 percent on game day,

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.079
who wins?

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.759
I expect to be the last
man standing this year.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:42.199
A fallen warrior
arrives in Las Vegas.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.039
It pains him to be a spectator,

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.319
for this sport and its contenders

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.439
have been his most constant family.

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.959
My phone used to ring
off the hook, you know?

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:55.799
Now it's a little quiet
and it's... damn, you know?

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.359
Am I taking it personal?

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.039
It's like you really
can't, you know?

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.239
It's what it is.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.959
Remember, it's... it's a business

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.919
and if you're not producing,

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.199
they could just drop
you, and that's something

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.759
I might have to do as
well, go into my next show

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.799
without a sponsor,
and that's gonna be

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.479
one of the biggest
challenges of my life,

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.319
not just coming back from injury

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.439
or coming back from seven
months of being incarcerated,

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.359
it's gonna be competing
as a free agent.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.519
That goes into the
whole question of,

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.039
"Does politics exist
in bodybuilding?"

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.399
It's alive and well.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.959
The hypocrisy is
part of the business,

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.302
it's part of it.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.279
The makings of a
champion are elusive.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.439
Is it in the genes?

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.199
Are some destined for greatness

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.119
while others doomed to mediocrity?

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.399
Or is a warrior made,
forged out of steel,

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.319
honed from oak and
chiseled from the stone

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.479
of his skilled hands?

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.959
The Mr. Olympia Competition

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:06.039
has been sanctioned
by the IFBB since 1965.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.399
It alone decides who is
the best in the world.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.479
Come on, Branch.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.879
I didn't even get to pump up!

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.679
Can someone bring me some
dumbbells or something?

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.439
We're back at the 2012 Mr. Olympia.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.999
I'm Lane Norton with
my co-host, Larry Pepe,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.239
and Larry, we talked about...

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.359
is this the beginning
of a run for Phil?

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.479
If he hits it tonight,
do you think he starts

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.719
to put these guys
more in his rear view,

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.359
and start to build on that momentum

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.919
and maybe get three, four,
five, six Mr. Olympias?

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:41.919
I think coming in, we thought
the question for Phil is:

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.479
Is this gonna be that
type of performance

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.799
where you just look
up there, you see him

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.359
and you say, "it's him,"

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.239
and everybody else kinda
battling out for second?

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.279
I think we now feel that
it's him and Kai Greene.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.799
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know,

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.559
the Mr. Olympia final
results will be based

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.199
on a combination of both tonight's

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.839
and tomorrow's scores.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.119
The lights flash.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.985
The pre-judging begins.

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.199
There's just something
to be said for the dude

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.959
that can...

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.839
Man, he can...

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.319
He can run up in there with an arm

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.959
tied behind his back and still...

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.144
he's still a deadly dude.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.984
Man, you still gotta
watch out for him!

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.999
And even with that,

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.879
this dude is still
fighting for his life.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.959
And then...

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.359
slowly...

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:53.830
persuade the masses
to start to favor him.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.759
When you line up the
best in the world,

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.559
it's so easy to judge.

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.159
When you're right there in person,

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.759
you see everything.

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.559
Sometimes a photographer
will take a picture

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.599
and Phil's looking great,
Jay doesn't look great,

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:11.319
or Kai or Branch,

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.199
you need to see it all together

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.399
and also, it's not the clearest
of quality on the internet,

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:17.999
not like in living color.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.867
Being there and seeing
it, it's pretty easy.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.359
Phil Heath and Kai
Greene, right off the bat,

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.639
seem to separate
themselves from the pack.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.639
Those two clearly,
Number One and Number Two.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.319
If there was any question,

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.599
we answered that in
the final call-out

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.399
when they were the only two
brought back, center stage.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.359
I think there's a lot of
support out there for Kai Greene,

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.719
there's a lot of people who think

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.599
that he's winning this contest.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.919
Listen to me, you beat
him every freakin' shot.

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.239
Hands down.

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.679
Hands down, okay?

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.439
And the feeling
was, he was terrible.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:06.599
He was picking your best shots too,

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.279
side triceps,

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.919
Back double biceps, you
frickin' creamed him.

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:13.879
Do you really think that, George?

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.319
You have the frickin'
edge, would I lie to you?

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.159
It's Mr. Olympia,
the best of the best.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.759
You saw it.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:22.879
Once you start, you know?

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.959
That was getting close

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.399
with the whole Kai thing and...

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.799
Kai starts good,

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.439
he started getting better

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.959
until he becomes great and then,

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.279
and then you shave it
down to the top guys

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.439
and those top guys
were Phil and Kai.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.279
The drama came in there,
'cause first you go,

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.079
"Okay, yeah, you know, Phil's
walking away with this,"

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.639
then you look, you go,

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.759
"Wait a minute, this is
getting closer than I think."

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.719
The more you look,
the closer it got.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.399
I mean, I don't know how
much tighter I can get.

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.439
I wouldn't try to get
fuller if I was you.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.319
Thank you.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.199
I mean, really.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.639
There's no way I could
be any tighter than I was.

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.839
I mean, I lose room all
the way up past my hip.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.479
What else can I do?

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:13.189
I mean, you tell me
where I can be tighter.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.279
I think I was tighter
than last year,

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:20.279
easily, easily but...

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:24.519
I think what I presented
was good enough for the win.

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.119
But we'll wait and see.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.782
- Want some water, champ?
- No, I'm good.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.864
Not always gonna
hear what you want.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:41.639
So that's when you exit.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:44.347
Because you don't need to
hear negativity right now.

01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.279
If anything, I like to be the guy

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:52.479
that smiles, plays
nicely, you know?

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.319
But I'm trying to
take your head off

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:57.599
just like anybody else.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.759
Don't sleep!

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.999
Okay, now I am starting
to get irritated,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.519
like, I can't deal with
that shit right now.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.119
You know what I'm saying?

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:24.959
I can't think like that right now.

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.319
That shit has no
importance whatsoever

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.039
to me winning this show.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:31.519
We won last year
with a perfect score.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:34.559
It'd be nice to try to do it again.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:35.759
It would be nice, I mean,

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.639
I don't know if that's Hany's goal.

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.079
That's mine.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.639
It's always a goal to try to win.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.319
To win, perfect score.

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:44.519
I mean, this is definitely
a hard focus right now,

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.919
there's no soft focus at all.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.279
Like, this is
definitely very serious.

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.159
When you start stressing,
your body starts changing.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.839
And just... and a lot of people

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.279
who've done competitions have
looked absolutely amazing,

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.639
and then, all of a sudden,
the stress hormone kicks in,

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.119
and their bodies
just kinda fade away

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.439
and they don't
understand what happened.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.719
This is not where you
let off the gas, either.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.381
I'm gonna have to get going.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.919
Catch your breath, that's right.

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.039
- Huh?
- Catch your breath.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.119
Come on!

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.599
That's right.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.261
Yeah, if you want.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.719
I know I'm the champ.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.319
I don't have to keep saying it.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.719
They know I'm the champ, too.

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.559
My title is Mr. Olympia.

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:40.879
Theirs isn't.

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.879
And they're trying to get there?

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.919
They've gotta fight me all day.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.184
There's no way I'm gonna lose.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.839
The champ takes a moment to drive

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.959
through the streets of
Vegas to clear his head.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.639
The most important
battle of his life

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:14.119
lies here moments away.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.305
The battle that will define
him as a competitor forever.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.839
As you know, it's Olympia weekend.

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.839
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.919
bodybuilding fans
from around the world,

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.679
welcome to the 48th
edition of the fall classic,

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.439
the Mr. Olympia!

01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:09.319
For those that was here last night,

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.199
you saw one of the most
exciting pre-judgings

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.879
in Olympia history.

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.399
Because once again, folks, only one person
can hold the Sandow and only one man

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.301
will be crowned Mr. Olympia.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.119
Mr. Olympia is my
dream, my life dream.

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.399
I can't think of anything else

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.359
that will ever happen to me again in
my life that will mean as much to me,

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.039
because it was
nothing but sheer will,

01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.464
determination, and stubbornness.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.719
I knew from the time I was 18

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.559
what I wanted to do in life.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.279
I set goals for myself.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.519
I've accomplished every
goal I set out for myself,

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.479
except for one, and
that's win the Mr. Olympia.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:28.719
I'm training for this title,
I want to win this title.

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.079
My daughter is my biggest fan,

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.879
she's always at the Olympia,

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.199
she always wants to be there

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.279
and I won my first show

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.679
where my wife and my daughter

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.159
were together there watching us,

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:44.039
and that was amazing,
you see the girls crying,

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.781
because they are so
happy, it's amazing.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.359
You know, in Japan,

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.639
nobody really
challenged it before me.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:59.839
I thought I was going to
be the first one really

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.999
to challenge the top.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.839
I want to prove that bodybuilding

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.785
is not all about size.

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.119
It's a dream for every bodybuilder

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:19.559
to stand on the
stage for Mr. Olympia.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.359
It was my dream.

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.359
It was my dream,
and I make it true.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.942
Everybody can make it
true if you want it.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.479
From Brooklyn, New
York, comes a predator.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.239
Ladies and gentlemen, Kai Greene!

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.199
When I was younger

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:44.799
I'd leave the cold
institutional facility,

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.319
go to a bodybuilding show,

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.959
and I'd stand there on stage

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:52.679
with athletes, teenagers,
that had people at home

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:55.959
invested in seeing them succeed.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:58.559
You'd hear a very proud mom or pop,

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:01.279
sitting in the third or fourth row

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.199
and then there was
you, no mom, no dad,

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.999
there's nobody gonna be
sitting in the audience,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.359
proud of you, but you were proud.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:17.900
You took pleasure in
beating those guys that did.

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.639
He's your reigning and
current Mr. Olympia,

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.919
"The Gift," Phil Heath!

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.319
They only nitpick the best.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.919
They only criticize the best.

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.039
They do!

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:56.479
In all sports, they do.

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.319
Because it's hard for someone
to say, "He's just perfect

01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.999
and we'll never talk about him".

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.786
They have to say something!

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.879
Did they announce it?

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:51.781
- Did they announce the Top 10?
- No.

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.867
I'm just gonna go.

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:06.119
As I call you out, that
means you're in the Top 10,

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.119
if you need to go see
Pro Tan, get greased up,

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.039
go down and do it, then
we'll get you up there.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.279
In numeric order,
please, gentlemen.

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.519
Can I have Branch Warren,

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.279
Tony Freeman,

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.039
Johnnie Jackson,

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.319
Evan Centopani,

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.279
Lionel Beyeke,

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.359
Dexter Jackson,

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.119
Shawn Rhoden,

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.799
Dennis Wolf,

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.199
Kai Greene,

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:34.239
and Phil Heath.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.199
Once again, Branch, Tony,
Johnnie, Evan, Lionel,

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:41.039
Dexter, Shawn,
Dennis, Kai and Phil.

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:42.599
That's our Top 10,
thank you, gentlemen,

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.159
we should have you on
stage in roughly 20 minutes.

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.199
Roelly, sorry, brother.

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:48.599
Fuel for next year, baby!

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.067
Come back next year.

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:06.079
All right, let's bring out
our Top 10 back on stage.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:08.479
Gentlemen!

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.959
Hey, we've got one more call.

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:12.079
I need Phil and Kai back.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.021
That's gonna be it, group.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.262
Okay, now.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.319
Quarter-turn to... no,
wait, hold on, stop it.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:38.279
No, wait, stay back on
the line both of yous.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.307
And do me a favor, take
two steps to your right.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.199
Do me a favor, take a
step apart from each other,

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:55.039
there's plenty of room.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:42:56.599
Gotta stay on the
same side, come on,

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.399
a little bit of room between yous.

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.559
Come on, Phil, take one
more... yup, thank you!

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:04.079
Okay, now, front.

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:06.025
Front double bicep.

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.150
Come on now, front double bicep.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.239
And relax.

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:25.663
Relax, front lat spread.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.105
Okay, both, front lat spread.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.959
And relax.

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.269
Either side for side chest.

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.399
And relax.

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.901
Back double bicep.

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:06.839
And relax.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.102
Face forward.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.424
Your favorite most muscular.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.559
And relax... and relax.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:28.319
Okay, thank yous very much.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.187
This concludes our
confirmation round.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.799
All right folks, here we go.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.679
Are we ready for the awards?

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.879
Aileen, please take
the sixth-place award

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.950
to our sixth-place finisher.

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.639
Dennis "Big Bad" Wolf!

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.639
The fifth-place award,

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:57.471
Branch Warren!

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:04.919
The fourth-place award,

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.759
"The Blade," Dexter Jackson!

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.599
The third-place award,

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:12.944
"Flexatron," Shawn Rhoden.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.759
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
in Olympia tradition,

01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:21.991
Kai Greene, Phil Heath,
center stage, please.

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:38.660
Ladies and gentlemen, we
had a one-point decision.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:45.959
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next name I announce

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:50.719
will be the winner of
the 2012 Mr. Olympia!

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.028
Come on, baby!

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.439
When I did find myself in
institutional placement,

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:03.547
the cold, oppressive
feeling of, like...

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:12.199
Like you don't matter
and you may never,

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:16.879
ever, ever matter again.

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:21.159
I began to talk about competing
in the Olympia one day.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.221
I really did not develop Plan B.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:31.199
But I didn't, I didn't.

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:36.719
I didn't just talk
about it, it's like...

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:39.951
I really believed that
it was gonna happen.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.559
Phil Heath!

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:23.669
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Olympia, Phil Heath!

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:27.839
I didn't get any sleep, trust me,

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.359
over the past 48
hours, because I knew

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.839
that these guys were all champions

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:36.359
and I knew they were bringing it.

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.519
Man, it feels freakin' good
to be king up in here, man.

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.639
I can't even lie.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.999
Did you feel nervous for a
second, like it was close?

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.239
Did you feel at any point nervous?

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:47.679
I think I was more
nervous yesterday.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.559
'Cause I felt that
after the first round,

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.719
I thought it was lights
out, and I kinda eased up

01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.359
off the gas, and that
kind of allowed Kai

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.639
to get more confidence
and to start making up

01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:58.959
ground on me, and it showed.

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.759
I mean, I could tell.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.639
And it was like the
power was going to him.

01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:06.759
Well, today I realized
what his game plan was,

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.999
and I just figured, I
gotta let it all hang out.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.679
This is my town, this is my show,

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.199
this is my title,
this is my throne.

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:15.919
And I refuse to give it to anybody.

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:17.839
They're gonna have
to fight me for it.

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.239
I know that I pushed
him to his best look,

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:24.279
and I knew I'm gonna go
against their biggest punch,

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.319
but like I said, wait
till I punch back.

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:28.399
What's next for Phil Heath?

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.639
What are you gonna do?

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.199
We're gonna party tonight, man.

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:34.271
We're gonna party.

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:27.159
The title was within his grasp.

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.399
A point away.

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:32.824
The smell of victory
teased his nostrils.

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.839
You know, no one's
gonna give you anything.

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.468
You gonna have to work for it.

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:16.879
I didn't come there
expecting gifts.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:19.269
I came there willing
to work for it.

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:27.639
And I believe that any man

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:31.279
that is willing to
work hard and labor long

01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:34.959
can attain the goal, as
long as it's realistic.

01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.479
I've seen enough
feedback that lets me know

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.144
that this is not unrealistic,
it's not impossible.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:48.239
We got a chance to
see the champ bleed.

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:50.639
And he bled.

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.983
He's still bleeding.

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:59.679
Whatever can be forced to
bleed against its own will

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.039
can be killed, it can
die, it can be beaten

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:07.271
and you know, um...

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:16.959
We got more work to do, you know?

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:18.985
