Nicky's gone crazy!

03:03.640 --> 03:05.541
Oh.

03:05.543 --> 03:06.843
This is the best Christmas ever.

03:09.712 --> 03:12.280
Mommy, why is Nicky
killing Christmas?

03:12.282 --> 03:14.815
It's just something
teenage girls do.

03:14.817 --> 03:17.587
Nicky, you stop this behavior,
right now!

03:19.089 --> 03:20.956
<i>Before you decide</i>

03:20.958 --> 03:22.590
<i>that I'm the bad guy here.</i>

03:22.592 --> 03:26.695
<i>Let me explain to you
about my childhood.</i>

03:26.697 --> 03:29.030
Be a little elf for us,
honey. Be a baby elf.

03:29.032 --> 03:31.099
Please, princess,
just be an elf.

03:31.101 --> 03:32.567
- Nicky.
- Oh!

03:32.569 --> 03:33.702
- Yeah... Oh! Get...
- Nicky...

03:33.704 --> 03:35.337
Get on with it.

03:35.339 --> 03:36.838
It'll be just one moment.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.839
<i>Even then,
my tiny baby brain knew</i>

03:38.841 --> 03:39.975
<i>I had to do something.</i>

03:39.977 --> 03:41.142
No elf.

03:41.144 --> 03:43.744
Her first words.
She said her first words!

03:43.746 --> 03:44.980
Christmas words.

03:44.982 --> 03:46.280
No elf.

03:47.717 --> 03:49.519
Sorry, kid, I can't help you.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.056
You're stuck with the family
you're born into.

03:55.893 --> 03:58.025
Your daddy has a very special

03:58.027 --> 03:59.994
Christmas surprise
for you, Nicky.

03:59.996 --> 04:01.329
A penguin?

04:01.331 --> 04:02.930
No, Nicky.

04:02.932 --> 04:06.767
It is a real live reindeer!

04:06.769 --> 04:08.337
Ah!

04:08.339 --> 04:10.005
Oh, no.

04:10.007 --> 04:12.874
Why is she wearing
her polar bear costume?

04:12.876 --> 04:15.743
Polar bears are
the natural enemies of reindeer.

04:15.745 --> 04:17.077
Everyone knows that.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.680
- No one knows that.
- It's common knowledge for him.

04:19.683 --> 04:20.815
Ah!

04:24.989 --> 04:27.723
- Bad, Blitzen!
- Stop that reindeer!

04:27.725 --> 04:31.693
<i>Even my first romance
was ruined by my dad's OCD.</i>

04:31.695 --> 04:32.927
<i>Obsessive Christmas disorder.</i>

04:32.929 --> 04:34.799
Thanks for taking me
to the movie.

04:38.936 --> 04:40.638
What's with all this
Christmas stuff?

04:41.337 --> 04:42.771
It's only September.

04:42.773 --> 04:44.508
Oh, this stuff?

04:47.044 --> 04:49.377
I didn't really notice.

04:49.379 --> 04:50.680
You just ignore it.

04:51.948 --> 04:53.648
You're so pretty.

04:55.051 --> 04:56.785
Wanna kiss?

04:56.787 --> 04:58.153
Okay.

04:58.155 --> 04:59.890
Never kissed a boy before.

05:05.028 --> 05:06.061
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

05:06.063 --> 05:07.496
Whoa!

05:07.498 --> 05:08.663
- <i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>
- <i>Oh, watch out, his hands, uh...</i>

05:08.665 --> 05:10.665
- <i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>
- Um, I mean,

05:10.667 --> 05:11.833
you can still kiss me.

05:11.835 --> 05:13.268
Not in front of Santa.

05:13.270 --> 05:15.871
- <i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>
- <i>How do you turn this thing off?</i>

05:15.873 --> 05:17.672
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

05:17.674 --> 05:19.441
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

05:22.378 --> 05:24.812
<i>♪ Christmas things

05:24.814 --> 05:25.946

05:25.948 --> 05:27.951
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

05:28.986 --> 05:30.184
I gotta go.

05:30.186 --> 05:31.787
Oh, curfew?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.958
- No.
- Oh, well, uh, text me!

05:34.691 --> 05:35.926
This was fun!

05:37.227 --> 05:39.427
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

05:39.429 --> 05:41.095
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

05:41.097 --> 05:43.398
<i>Merry Christmas, everybody.</i>

05:43.400 --> 05:46.100
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

05:46.102 --> 05:48.436
<i>Yes, some kids
with difficult childhoods</i>

05:48.438 --> 05:50.872
<i>turn to drugs and crime.</i>

05:50.874 --> 05:53.040
<i>Instead, I found my refuge</i>

05:53.042 --> 05:55.177
<i>in the traditional instrument
of rebellion.</i>

05:55.179 --> 05:56.711
<i>The tuba.</i>

06:11.761 --> 06:13.227
You know you're playing
the trumpet part,

06:13.229 --> 06:15.129
not the tenor tuba part, right?

06:15.131 --> 06:18.766
Hm. I'm a musical maverick.

06:18.768 --> 06:19.900
Playing the tuba
gives you those

06:19.902 --> 06:21.936
great looking upper arms, Nicky.

06:21.938 --> 06:23.405
And well-defined cheeks,

06:23.407 --> 06:26.475
but, uh, playing flute means
I get to tilt my head like this,

06:26.477 --> 06:29.076
which, uh, Josh,
that hot keyboard player,

06:29.078 --> 06:31.045
finds very attractive.

06:31.047 --> 06:33.114
Especially, when I go like this.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.754
Or he thinks
you're having a seizure.

06:38.756 --> 06:40.287
Performing arts camp
is the best, right?

06:40.289 --> 06:41.622
- Hmm.
- All right,

06:41.624 --> 06:42.723
I've put in my five minutes
of practice for the day,

06:42.725 --> 06:43.790
so let's go
before the cello girls

06:43.792 --> 06:46.127
- get all the guys.
- Ugh!

06:46.129 --> 06:47.362
God, those cello girls
are the worst.

06:47.364 --> 06:48.929
Look, I'm gonna have
to catch up with you.

06:48.931 --> 06:49.997
I gotta get this passage down.

06:49.999 --> 06:51.900
The double tonguing
is super tricky.

06:51.902 --> 06:53.104
Mm. You know what?

06:54.203 --> 06:55.903
I'd like to double tongue Josh.

06:55.905 --> 06:56.937
Oh...

06:56.939 --> 06:58.105
God.

06:58.107 --> 07:00.040
That was a good one, right?

07:00.042 --> 07:02.544
You should give me
more setups like that.

07:02.546 --> 07:04.780
Look, you can do this
whole focused-on-your-work thing

07:04.782 --> 07:08.917
all you want, but, uh,
we are sharing a closet here,

07:08.919 --> 07:10.985
and I've seen some
of the bras you brought.

07:10.987 --> 07:13.657
And some of them are super lacy.

07:14.323 --> 07:15.657
What's up with that?

07:15.659 --> 07:20.063
Well, surely you're not
suggesting something scandalous?

07:21.030 --> 07:22.032
Silly.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.936
Staying inside
on a summer day is so sad.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.807
Oi!

07:31.809 --> 07:32.943
Suit yourself.

07:35.345 --> 07:36.410
Okay.

08:00.369 --> 08:02.937
Who was playing
the trumpet song?

08:39.575 --> 08:41.075
Oh!

08:53.023 --> 08:54.923
Thank for walking me
to class again.

08:54.925 --> 08:57.291
Walking you?
I thought you were walking me.

08:57.293 --> 09:00.027
This is a pretty tough
neighborhood.

09:00.029 --> 09:01.898
I'll do my best to protect you.

09:03.332 --> 09:05.032
I need a tough

09:05.034 --> 09:06.601
Santa Clarita girl
who would keep me safe.

09:06.603 --> 09:08.806
Santa Clarita?
How'd you know that?

09:09.639 --> 09:11.372
Someone's a clever boy.

09:11.374 --> 09:13.109
Actually, it was written
on your tuba case.

09:14.143 --> 09:15.910
Oh!

09:15.912 --> 09:18.045
But I was clever enough
to learn to read when I was six,

09:18.047 --> 09:19.249
'cause I knew
this day would come.

09:20.683 --> 09:22.385
You wanna go on a date
some time, Nicky?

09:23.686 --> 09:26.221
Well, where would you take me?

09:26.223 --> 09:28.323
You know, I'm, uh, kind of
a fancy girl.

09:28.325 --> 09:29.723
Well, since there's only
a mess hall,

09:29.725 --> 09:32.327
I was thinking we could go
down there for a PowerBar?

09:32.329 --> 09:33.364
OG juice?

09:34.130 --> 09:35.131
Fancy enough.

09:42.104 --> 09:44.171
Okay, class,
for this next improv

09:44.173 --> 09:46.073
let me have two volunteers.

09:46.075 --> 09:48.075
- Oh, oh.
- Okay, Stephanie and...

09:48.077 --> 09:49.144
Josh.

09:49.146 --> 09:51.378
- Oh, Josh.
- Me. Pick me.

09:51.380 --> 09:52.948
And Josh.

09:52.950 --> 09:54.716
Oh!

09:58.154 --> 09:59.221
Slick move.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.389
- I respect a good wingwoman.
- Hi.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.958
That goes for both friends
and superheroes.

10:04.027 --> 10:05.392
Now we need a relationship

10:05.394 --> 10:06.962
- for these two.
- Married.

10:06.964 --> 10:08.496
- And a location.
- Desert island.

10:08.498 --> 10:09.963
And begin.

10:09.965 --> 10:12.700
Oh, honey, I can't believe
were stuck on a desert island

10:12.702 --> 10:15.002
for our tenth
wedding anniversary.

10:15.004 --> 10:16.737
It's not our anniversary.

10:16.739 --> 10:18.473
Oh. Stop, stop, stop.

10:18.475 --> 10:22.376
People, the first rule of improv
is, yes, and.

10:22.378 --> 10:24.445
Any time a scene partner
says something

10:24.447 --> 10:26.982
you must agree and add on to it.

10:26.984 --> 10:30.150
Yes, and, is the most important
rule in the theater.

10:30.152 --> 10:31.453
And in life.

10:31.455 --> 10:33.190
- Try it again.
- Okay.

10:34.124 --> 10:35.022
All right.

10:35.024 --> 10:37.992
Honey, help me!

10:37.994 --> 10:39.361
I'm... I'm downing,
I can't breathe.

10:39.363 --> 10:42.329
I need mouth to mouth
resuscitation. Save me, please.

10:42.331 --> 10:44.232
- She's drowning.
- No, I'm gonna die.

10:44.234 --> 10:45.400
You gotta kiss me
and give me mouth to mouth.

10:45.402 --> 10:46.501
Yeah, you just need to...

10:46.503 --> 10:47.972
Let's start our own improv.

10:51.508 --> 10:53.274
Yes, and.

11:01.151 --> 11:02.516
Can't believe we gotta go home.

11:02.518 --> 11:03.984
Summer really flies by,

11:03.986 --> 11:05.786
especially when you're hanging
with girl who's beautiful,

11:05.788 --> 11:07.421
and plays the tuba.

11:07.423 --> 11:09.524
I am a rare combination.

11:12.061 --> 11:13.495
Yes, you are.

11:13.497 --> 11:15.429
I hate that you live
in California.

11:15.431 --> 11:18.065
I hate that you live
in Connecticut.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.334
Maybe I can convince my dad
we should move to Cali.

11:20.336 --> 11:22.170
Okay.

11:22.172 --> 11:25.740
No one calls it Cali,
but it's cute when you do it.

11:25.742 --> 11:28.142
You know, I like this plan.

11:28.144 --> 11:30.045
I'll start making brownies
for your mom and dad

11:30.047 --> 11:31.415
as soon as I land.

11:32.315 --> 11:34.516
Well, my mom's actually...

11:34.518 --> 11:36.818
She's not around, you know.

11:36.820 --> 11:39.286
- Oh, I...
- Oh, no. It's totally fine.

11:39.288 --> 11:41.256
Not like she died or anything.

11:41.258 --> 11:42.526
Really, it's no big deal.

11:46.763 --> 11:49.133
Are your parents divorced?

11:51.067 --> 11:52.367
Yeah.

11:52.369 --> 11:55.038
My mom sorta left one day.

11:56.072 --> 11:58.238
- Wow.
- Yeah.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.475
It really hit my dad hard.

12:00.409 --> 12:01.444
I'm sorry.

12:02.611 --> 12:04.813
It's okay.

12:04.815 --> 12:06.450
Things don't seem so bad
when you're around.

12:12.288 --> 12:13.755
Aww.

12:13.757 --> 12:16.790
You guys are criminally adorable
but we're gonna miss our flight.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.126
Stephanie, how long
have you been standing there?

12:19.128 --> 12:21.398
No need to feel embarrassed,
your love gives me life.

12:23.233 --> 12:26.101
I don't get it.

12:26.103 --> 12:27.468
I hope this isn't
just a summer fling,

12:27.470 --> 12:30.838
because I really
wanna come visit you.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.376
It isn't.
And you better.

12:42.619 --> 12:45.285
Jesus. Mom?

12:45.287 --> 12:48.122
- Dad, I'm home.
- My baby!

12:48.124 --> 12:49.424
Oh!

12:49.426 --> 12:51.291
Mm. Missed you too, Dad.

12:51.293 --> 12:54.828
Oh, it is so difficult
being away from my daughter

12:54.830 --> 12:56.598
during the pre-Christmas season.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.599
- It's August.
- That's pre.

12:58.601 --> 13:01.269
Come on.
Everybody, Nicky's home!

13:01.271 --> 13:02.636
You must be so excited.

13:02.638 --> 13:04.405
Don't hit the displays,
I worked really hard on those.

13:04.407 --> 13:06.274
Fam, fam, family.

13:06.276 --> 13:08.675
Time for our
pre-Christmas meeting.

13:08.677 --> 13:11.246
- Noelle?
- Daddy, I'm here.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.248
Of course you are, sugar plum.
Good job.

13:14.250 --> 13:17.385
Ho, ho, hold a minute
there, Nicky.

13:17.387 --> 13:19.489
It's meeting time,
you're not going anywhere.

13:21.423 --> 13:23.158
Hey, Dad. I am present,

13:24.224 --> 13:25.193
and ready to do
whatever is necessary

13:25.195 --> 13:26.627
to ensure
the best Christmas ever.

13:26.629 --> 13:28.295
Well, that's my boy.

13:28.297 --> 13:30.430
Are you sure it's your boy?

13:30.432 --> 13:31.534
Mom!

13:33.570 --> 13:35.636
Really, we're going to...
We're gonna do this?

13:35.638 --> 13:38.305
And cut your hair,
you damn hippie.

13:38.307 --> 13:39.540
Okay. Really?

13:39.542 --> 13:41.244
She's not in her right mind.

13:45.916 --> 13:47.948
Anyways,

13:47.950 --> 13:51.352
as you all know, our family
is known in this neighborhood

13:51.354 --> 13:54.722
for its Christmas spirit,
Christmas cheer,

13:54.724 --> 13:56.524
and having more boughs of holly

13:56.526 --> 13:59.327
than any other house
in the state.

13:59.329 --> 14:00.527
And we are also known

14:00.529 --> 14:05.466
for having the most valuable
collectible item

14:05.468 --> 14:07.202
in all of Christmas land.

14:07.204 --> 14:08.670
I speak of course,

14:08.672 --> 14:11.506
of the very same hat
worn by Santa

14:11.508 --> 14:14.409
in the greatest film
of all time,

14:14.411 --> 14:17.212
<i>Miracle on 34th Street.</i>

14:17.214 --> 14:18.713
Not the remake,
but the original,

14:18.715 --> 14:20.615
way back in 1947.

14:20.617 --> 14:22.650
- Chills.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:22.652 --> 14:25.319
I actually wore that hat

14:25.321 --> 14:26.987
the day I proposed
to your mother.

14:26.989 --> 14:28.455
What girl could say no to that?

14:28.457 --> 14:32.694
I was also wearing it on the day
when each of you kids were born.

14:32.696 --> 14:34.228
And conceived.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.671
And I think you kids turned out
pretty darn good.

14:43.340 --> 14:47.677
Which makes that
one lucky hat. Hmm.

14:49.479 --> 14:51.545
And every year,

14:51.547 --> 14:55.384
I feel like we have to earn
the right to own this hat.

15:03.627 --> 15:05.593
Oh, honey.

15:05.595 --> 15:07.163
Stay inside, tears.

15:07.663 --> 15:09.198
Stay inside.

15:12.335 --> 15:13.670
Okay, who wants muffins?

15:44.468 --> 15:46.000
<i>Hello.</i>

15:47.336 --> 15:48.969
<i>Hey!</i>

15:48.971 --> 15:50.737
<i>I have a super
important question for you.</i>

15:50.739 --> 15:54.344
<i>Do you guys do like, uh,
you know, a big Christmas?</i>

15:55.512 --> 15:57.745
What? No.

15:57.747 --> 15:59.847
It's totally low-key.
Very chill.

15:59.849 --> 16:01.848
In fact, it's a low-key version
of chill.

16:01.850 --> 16:03.684
Why, what have you heard?

16:03.686 --> 16:05.520
<i>I was thinking,</i>

16:05.522 --> 16:07.391
<i>maybe me and my dad could
come out to Cali to see you.</i>

16:09.058 --> 16:11.391
Really?

16:11.393 --> 16:12.395
That's...

16:13.095 --> 16:14.862
That's amazing.

16:14.864 --> 16:16.229
I'm so excited,

16:16.231 --> 16:18.598
I'm gonna let the fact
that you called it "Cali" slide.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.333
<i>I didn't really get into it,</i>

16:20.335 --> 16:23.804
<i>but, um, when my mom left us,
she actually left</i>

16:23.806 --> 16:26.473
<i>on Christmas day.</i>

16:26.475 --> 16:28.477
<i>It'd be good for my dad
to get outta here.</i>

16:29.611 --> 16:31.245
<i>Being around the snow,</i>

16:31.247 --> 16:33.580
<i>the decorations,
the trees in this town...</i>

16:33.582 --> 16:35.348
<i>it's not good for him.</i>

16:35.350 --> 16:37.617
<i>I mean, that Christmas morning
she left all those stockings</i>

16:37.619 --> 16:39.319
<i>just empty.</i>

16:39.321 --> 16:43.357
<i>You know, big Christmas tree,
no presents underneath.</i>

16:43.359 --> 16:46.727
<i>I think every ornament he sees
is like a stab to the heart.</i>

16:46.729 --> 16:48.262
Stab.

16:48.264 --> 16:50.433
<i>The main thing is,
I get to see you.</i>

16:54.370 --> 16:55.536
Did you miss me?

16:55.538 --> 16:57.872
- <i>Uh, mostly the tuba.</i>
- Mm.

16:57.874 --> 17:00.375
<i>But I guess I missed you too.</i>

17:00.377 --> 17:02.010
<i>This is gonna be great.</i>

17:02.012 --> 17:04.446
<i>I'm really looking forward
to a low-key Christmas.</i>

17:05.781 --> 17:07.513
Okay, okay.
Everyone set?

17:07.516 --> 17:11.519
Christmas family photo,
in three, two, one.

17:17.827 --> 17:19.262
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.867
This is a disaster.

17:26.868 --> 17:29.305
Well, matzoh ball soup
fixes everything.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.905
See? Isn't that better?

17:31.907 --> 17:33.508
Nope.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.841
Tanner's still flying
2,000 miles

17:34.843 --> 17:36.143
to get away from Christmas.

17:36.145 --> 17:38.445
And instead, he and his dad
are gonna wind up

17:38.447 --> 17:40.714
in the eye
of the Christmas tornado.

17:40.716 --> 17:43.784
My house is ground zero
for holiday horrors.

17:43.786 --> 17:45.619
It's a Christmas crap storm.

17:45.621 --> 17:47.821
I can't put the poor guy through
a Christmas version

17:47.823 --> 17:49.690
of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>

17:49.692 --> 17:51.024
Don't...

17:51.026 --> 17:53.194
Maybe I can ask my dad
to tone it down this year,

17:53.196 --> 17:54.694
just this one time.

17:54.696 --> 17:56.196
Maybe, I dunno.

17:56.198 --> 17:57.531
Hey, Nicky.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.700
I thought I saw your dad
on the line at the mall

17:59.702 --> 18:00.934
to sit in Santa's lap.

18:00.936 --> 18:04.438
Is that a holiday thing
or a lifestyle change?

18:05.509 --> 18:08.412
At least I know
who my father is, Danny.

18:08.911 --> 18:10.511
Ooh.

18:12.615 --> 18:15.482
I'm sorry.

18:15.484 --> 18:19.186
Oh, look at me, the stress
of this is turning me evil.

18:19.188 --> 18:20.722
I wish I could just be Jewish

18:20.724 --> 18:23.158
like you, and then I wouldn't
have to deal with any of this.

18:24.224 --> 18:25.760
Yes, because to be Jewish
is to live a problem-free life.

18:25.762 --> 18:26.961
I mean, historically,

18:26.963 --> 18:28.898
when have the Jews
ever had any troubles?

18:30.867 --> 18:32.599
Maybe I could ask Tanner
to come over

18:32.601 --> 18:33.835
spring break instead.

18:33.837 --> 18:35.802
I think that's much safer.

18:35.804 --> 18:38.239
But his love might die by then.

18:38.241 --> 18:39.674
Better to chance
the slow death of his love,

18:39.676 --> 18:43.176
than he meets your family
and it just dies instantly.

18:43.178 --> 18:44.511
You're right.

18:44.513 --> 18:46.713
- I have to tell him now to come.
- Mm-hmm.

18:49.953 --> 18:51.388
Ow!

18:52.754 --> 18:54.957
No father, now this.

18:58.761 --> 18:59.926
<i>I can do it.</i>

18:59.928 --> 19:00.793
<i>Let me hear you say it</i>

19:00.795 --> 19:01.895
- I can do it.
- Okay.

19:01.897 --> 19:03.931
Then let me hear you say it.

19:03.933 --> 19:05.566
Tanner, I'm sorry.

19:05.568 --> 19:07.033
But I can't see you
at Christmas.

19:07.035 --> 19:09.703
Good. Now just stay strong.

19:09.705 --> 19:11.806
Let him know spring break
will be here before he knows it,

19:11.808 --> 19:15.512
and then, bam! Lovers reunite,
music swells, fade to black. Ha!

19:16.646 --> 19:17.748
Okay.

19:24.286 --> 19:26.220
<i>Hey!</i>

19:26.222 --> 19:28.055
Hey! Uh, so...

19:28.057 --> 19:31.826
Uh, I was thinking about
what you said about coming,

19:31.828 --> 19:33.394
- And...
- <i>I know,</i>

19:33.396 --> 19:35.096
<i>I can't stop thinking
about it either, I'm so excited.</i>

19:35.098 --> 19:37.865
<i>You know, my dad
is looking forward to it too.</i>

19:40.536 --> 19:42.235
- Well...
- <i>Hold on.</i>

19:42.237 --> 19:44.004
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

19:44.006 --> 19:45.542
<i>You don't want me to come?</i>

19:46.309 --> 19:48.041
Um...

19:48.043 --> 19:49.109
<i>No, if you don't feel
the same way I do,</i>

19:49.111 --> 19:49.976
<i>I don't wanna pressure you.</i>

19:49.978 --> 19:52.213
No, no. No, it's not about that.

19:52.215 --> 19:53.817
I... I don't feel
pressure at all.

19:54.817 --> 19:56.651
So...

19:56.653 --> 19:57.952
We both still really
like each other

19:57.954 --> 19:59.686
after all these months, huh?

19:59.688 --> 20:02.022
I guess this is pretty serious.

20:02.024 --> 20:03.724
<i>To be honest,</i>

20:03.726 --> 20:04.725
<i>I'm just using you
because I need a tuba player</i>

20:04.727 --> 20:05.427
<i>for my death metal band.</i>

20:07.062 --> 20:08.596
<i>You shred a mean tuba.</i>

20:10.699 --> 20:13.267
You probably say that tuba stuff
to all the girls.

20:13.269 --> 20:14.769
<i>I got you something.</i>

20:14.771 --> 20:15.802
<i>It's a surprise.</i>

20:15.804 --> 20:16.971
<i>You wanna know what it is?</i>

20:16.973 --> 20:18.239
- I...
- <i>It's a present</i>

20:18.241 --> 20:20.308
<i>I had made for you.</i>

20:20.310 --> 20:21.876
<i>Gold bass clef symbol.</i>

20:21.878 --> 20:24.779
<i>Because you know,
you rock the bottom.</i>

20:24.781 --> 20:28.115
<i>I mean, bottom musically.
Musically speaking.</i>

20:28.117 --> 20:29.782
- Hmm.
- <i>It's a bass clef</i>

20:29.784 --> 20:33.687
<i>and a treble clef upside down,
and it makes a heart.</i>

20:33.689 --> 20:35.121
<i>You sure it's okay
if we come out there?</i>

20:35.123 --> 20:37.724
Uh, you made her
a musical heart,

20:37.726 --> 20:39.961
yes, yes, of course
you should come. Duh.

20:39.963 --> 20:42.062
<i>Okay. What about you, Nicky?</i>

20:42.064 --> 20:43.466
Oh.

20:45.734 --> 20:48.038
I would love to see you
at Christmas.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.940
And in conclusion,

20:52.942 --> 20:56.010
with the addition
of the extra power generator

20:56.012 --> 20:58.980
providing us with 500 more amps.

20:58.982 --> 21:04.050
The power output
of our display comes to a total,

21:04.052 --> 21:06.654
one million watts.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.121
Whoa!

21:08.123 --> 21:09.592
Oh!

21:11.727 --> 21:15.730
This may be the year
that our display

21:15.732 --> 21:17.764
will be seen from space.

21:20.936 --> 21:22.703
You got jingle balls, Dad.

21:22.705 --> 21:25.071
Rudy!

21:25.073 --> 21:27.074
Noelle, why are you laughing?

21:27.076 --> 21:29.876
I don't know.

21:29.878 --> 21:32.748
And the best part of all

21:33.182 --> 21:35.649
is, this.

21:37.052 --> 21:40.387
Ha? Ah! See?

21:41.491 --> 21:45.662
You control
exactly how it moves.

21:46.728 --> 21:47.895
Now, uh...

21:47.897 --> 21:49.829
Nicky, obviously,
you're the only one

21:49.831 --> 21:51.165
in the family
with the dance moves

21:51.167 --> 21:53.867
who could do Santa's big number
at the end of the tour.

21:53.869 --> 21:57.070
So you're gonna have
to operate it all night.

21:57.072 --> 21:59.074
Can I talk to you and mom
for a smidge?

22:00.877 --> 22:01.942
Privately.

22:01.944 --> 22:03.242
- Oh.
- Good.

22:03.244 --> 22:05.111
Because we actually wanted
to talk to you too.

22:05.113 --> 22:06.379
Hmm.

22:06.381 --> 22:08.883
We're gonna need the room
a minute, Noelle.

22:08.885 --> 22:09.983
You too.

22:09.985 --> 22:11.952
So that's how it's gonna be?

22:11.954 --> 22:13.154
Bye.

22:15.224 --> 22:18.826
- What I wanted to say was...
- Thank you.

22:18.828 --> 22:20.094
- What?
- Thank you.

22:20.096 --> 22:21.194
Thank you?

22:21.196 --> 22:22.963
For all
the great Christmases.

22:22.965 --> 22:24.130
You're welcome.

22:24.132 --> 22:25.464
But we really wanna
keep this on you.

22:25.466 --> 22:28.469
We want you to know that
as much fun as Christmas is,

22:28.471 --> 22:29.569
we also know it's a lot of work.

22:29.571 --> 22:30.937
- A lot of fun work.
- A lot of work

22:30.939 --> 22:32.205
that you didn't sign up for,
but you do it anyway.

22:32.207 --> 22:35.408
And we just wanted to say
thank you so much

22:35.410 --> 22:37.110
for being an amazing daughter.

22:37.112 --> 22:39.413
And allowing our family
to be who we are.

22:39.415 --> 22:40.580
Especially, this year.

22:40.582 --> 22:43.652
Yeah, about that.
Look, I was thinking...

22:44.920 --> 22:46.154
Wait. Why this year?

22:46.156 --> 22:48.923
- Uh, because of Noelle.
- She's seven.

22:48.925 --> 22:51.157
Seven is the perfect age
to experience Christmas.

22:51.159 --> 22:52.792
You're young enough
to see the magic.

22:52.794 --> 22:54.462
Uh, some of us
never grow out of it.

22:54.464 --> 22:57.098
But old enough to understand
the deeper meaning.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.499
Christmas as a seven-year-old

22:58.501 --> 23:00.134
is a once
in a lifetime experience.

23:00.136 --> 23:02.435
You and Rudy had yours.

23:02.437 --> 23:04.206
- This year belongs to Noelle.
- Hmm.

23:05.942 --> 23:07.942
Is there research
to back that up?

23:07.944 --> 23:08.945
Oh.

23:14.117 --> 23:16.850
Oh.

23:16.852 --> 23:18.220
So what did you want
to talk to us about, sweetie?

23:19.921 --> 23:25.526
Just about how much
I love our Christmases.

23:25.528 --> 23:27.528
Aww!

23:27.530 --> 23:28.628
- Get in here.
- Hey, come over.

23:28.630 --> 23:34.704
<i>♪ And a Happy New Year ♪</i>

23:35.871 --> 23:37.105
Steph, there's gotta be
another way.

23:37.107 --> 23:39.139
Noelle can still have
a magical Christmas

23:39.141 --> 23:41.776
without this massive
lighting display.

23:41.778 --> 23:44.177
And why didn't you
tell them that?

23:44.179 --> 23:47.114
Uh, you should've seen
the looks on their faces.

23:47.116 --> 23:48.782
You're stuck between
a Christmas tree

23:48.784 --> 23:49.817
and a hard place.

23:49.819 --> 23:50.984
If your dad makes

23:50.986 --> 23:52.752
a bigger lighting display
than before.

23:52.754 --> 23:56.156
<i>Tanner and his dad will see it
before the plane even lands.</i>

23:56.158 --> 23:58.492
No, I know. It's a hazard.

23:59.395 --> 24:01.127
That's it!

24:01.129 --> 24:02.797
You're a genius.

24:02.799 --> 24:03.800
Aw!

24:05.201 --> 24:06.533
I'm a genius.

24:06.535 --> 24:08.202
No, no, no!

24:14.577 --> 24:18.181
Thank you so much,
for meeting with me, Councilman.

24:19.115 --> 24:22.515
This family must be stopped.

24:22.517 --> 24:25.251
This is the car crash
that happened three years ago

24:25.253 --> 24:28.121
because motorist were watching
the family's Christmas display

24:28.123 --> 24:30.158
in the front of the house,
instead of the road.

24:31.224 --> 24:33.059
And then,
12,000 homes lost power

24:33.061 --> 24:36.765
because this family's display
overloaded the grid.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.934
Well, that's not
a very good picture

24:40.936 --> 24:42.869
because all the lights were out.

24:42.871 --> 24:44.871
What about
all this wasted energy?

24:44.873 --> 24:47.140
What kind of a planet
are we leaving

24:47.142 --> 24:48.408
for Christmases in the future?

24:48.410 --> 24:52.078
So, Councilman Hecht,
as a concerned citizen

24:52.080 --> 24:54.147
who is in no way connected
to this family,

24:54.149 --> 24:58.351
I urge you to order the police
to enforce these existing laws

24:58.353 --> 25:01.924
that prohibit massive
Christmas displays like this.

25:03.192 --> 25:05.729
But polls show people
like Christmas.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.128
There's an obscure but valid law

25:09.130 --> 25:11.999
against this many lights
at one house.

25:12.001 --> 25:15.071
But also, people don't like it
when obscure laws are enforced.

25:16.138 --> 25:18.071
But it's the right thing to do.

25:18.073 --> 25:20.007
Polls show that
the right thing to do

25:20.009 --> 25:22.011
is not the popular thing to do.

25:23.279 --> 25:26.012
Why do you care so much
about polls?

25:26.014 --> 25:27.282
There's an election coming up.

25:31.286 --> 25:32.955
I'll give you a hundred bucks...

25:34.623 --> 25:35.958
for your campaign.

25:41.898 --> 25:43.062
- Oh, no.
- Why?

25:43.064 --> 25:44.665
Is everything okay, Dad?

25:44.667 --> 25:47.667
No. This is a court order
prohibiting us

25:47.669 --> 25:50.037
from doing our normal
Christmas display.

25:50.039 --> 25:52.106
It... It limits our wattage,

25:52.108 --> 25:54.674
- and the height of our tree.
- But why?

25:54.676 --> 25:58.111
Apparently, there some
obscure city ordinance about,

25:58.113 --> 26:00.313
"ostentatious
Christmas displays."

26:00.315 --> 26:03.051
I hate it when obscure laws
are enforced.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.552
And right when we're about

26:05.554 --> 26:07.421
to have Noelle's most special
Christmas ever.

26:07.423 --> 26:11.058
What kind of monster
would do this to us?

26:11.060 --> 26:13.193
Oh, my...

26:13.195 --> 26:15.296
What kinda world
are we living in?

26:15.298 --> 26:16.329
You know what,
maybe we'll cut down

26:16.331 --> 26:17.998
- on the inflatables.
- Hey, Dad!

26:18.000 --> 26:19.199
Look.

26:19.201 --> 26:20.701
- Oh!
- It's your hat.

26:20.703 --> 26:23.203
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

26:23.205 --> 26:26.005
Oh, if ever I needed
a magical Santa hat

26:26.007 --> 26:28.008
now would be the time.

26:28.010 --> 26:30.344
Hey, buddy,
what have you got for me?

26:30.346 --> 26:31.945
Chris, it's gonna be okay.

26:31.947 --> 26:33.215
Shh! I'm talking to the hat.

26:34.215 --> 26:35.382
Tell me what to do.

26:35.384 --> 26:37.353
I hope this isn't hereditary.

26:38.654 --> 26:41.055
Chris, are you all right?

26:41.057 --> 26:44.426
Actually, I'm better
than all right.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.726
Chris, what are you doing?

26:46.728 --> 26:49.996
Uh, you remember
that thing I built in college?

26:49.998 --> 26:52.098
- What thing?
- The Christmas thing.

26:52.100 --> 26:53.701
You've built a million
Christmas things.

26:56.171 --> 26:58.739
Oh, that Christmas thing.

26:58.741 --> 27:00.707
Can you believe
I almost threw this away?

27:00.709 --> 27:02.444
Okay.

27:03.244 --> 27:04.914
Behold.

27:06.081 --> 27:07.513
The Christmas cave.

27:07.515 --> 27:09.384
- Cool, Dad!
- Mm-hmm.

27:10.285 --> 27:11.452
Pretty.

27:11.454 --> 27:12.686
Christmas cave?

27:12.688 --> 27:15.289
- That's not a thing.
- Yet. Not a thing yet.

27:15.291 --> 27:16.589
How do you think
a thing becomes a thing.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.325
If nobody ever did a thing
that wasn't a thing

27:18.327 --> 27:20.260
there would be no things.

27:20.262 --> 27:22.730
So we're gonna dig a hole
in the backyard?

27:22.732 --> 27:25.165
No. No, Nicky.

27:25.167 --> 27:27.467
We are going to build this.

27:27.469 --> 27:31.137
A huge outdoor ice cave.

27:31.139 --> 27:34.241
And we're gonna put our family
Christmas display inside

27:34.243 --> 27:36.510
with the hologram Santa
at the end.

27:36.512 --> 27:40.481
Absolutely zero wattage
will be seen from the outside,

27:40.483 --> 27:43.416
but when people
enter the cave...

27:45.221 --> 27:48.422
Oh, they will get
the full effect

27:48.424 --> 27:50.960
of our family's
Christmas spirit.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.228
Uh, is there gonna be
trolls in the cave?

27:54.230 --> 27:55.462
No, Noelle. No trolls.

27:55.464 --> 27:57.431
But trolls live in caves.

27:57.433 --> 27:59.098
Trolls live under bridges.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.567
You guys really need
to get more involved

28:00.569 --> 28:02.071
with her education.

28:04.305 --> 28:07.509
I was kicked out
of dental school.

28:09.445 --> 28:11.310
This city ordinance
is the best thing

28:11.312 --> 28:12.745
that ever happened to us.

28:12.747 --> 28:16.282
We start construction tomorrow.

28:20.321 --> 28:22.455
Okay, I'm gonna have you work
on the west wing first, okay?

28:22.457 --> 28:24.390
'Cause you're working
with hammers and nails.

28:24.392 --> 28:27.126
I'm going to eat this soup
and then I'm going to die.

28:27.128 --> 28:29.463
That's quite the to-do list.

28:29.465 --> 28:31.531
When Tanner and his dad
see the Christmas cave,

28:31.533 --> 28:33.032
his dad will get PTSD,

28:33.034 --> 28:35.435
Tanner will relive the horror
of his mom leaving at Christmas,

28:35.437 --> 28:37.203
and then I will murder
my family.

28:37.205 --> 28:39.306
So I should die first
to avoid all that.

28:39.308 --> 28:41.140
I can't argue with that logic.

28:41.142 --> 28:44.110
Why can't I just have
a normal family?

28:44.112 --> 28:45.280
Oh!

29:01.397 --> 29:04.298
- Dad?
- Yes, my son.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.799
When I grow up
will I be responsible

29:05.801 --> 29:07.867
for Christmas, like you?

29:07.869 --> 29:10.104
Well, if that's what you want.

29:10.106 --> 29:12.806
And if you're lucky enough
to find a young lady

29:12.808 --> 29:14.444
that loves Christmas
like your mother.

29:15.811 --> 29:18.311
Well, then I should
know some stuff.

29:18.313 --> 29:21.181
Well, all right.

29:21.183 --> 29:22.549
Ask me anything.

29:22.551 --> 29:24.651
Hm, you seem to spend
a lot of time on Christmas.

29:24.653 --> 29:26.552
Oh, you bet I do.

29:26.554 --> 29:28.291
But what about your job?

29:29.657 --> 29:32.526
Well, that has come up.

29:32.528 --> 29:35.361
But I tell them the season
is a priority to me.

29:35.363 --> 29:36.597
And they respect that.

29:36.599 --> 29:38.264
- Cool!
- Oh, sure,

29:38.266 --> 29:40.166
Stu gets a promotion even though

29:40.168 --> 29:43.136
I've been with the company
longer than him.

29:43.138 --> 29:44.404
- I got it...
- And Laura leapfrogged

29:44.406 --> 29:45.206
right over me.

29:46.407 --> 29:47.640
- Okay.
- I'm not even sure

29:47.642 --> 29:49.576
anyone there knows my name.

29:49.578 --> 29:54.580
But that's not important
because Christmas comes first.

29:54.582 --> 29:57.285
And exactly how much do we spend
on Christmas a year?

29:59.155 --> 30:00.521
Well, uh...

30:00.523 --> 30:02.655
I don't... I don't think
you need to know the exact...

30:02.657 --> 30:04.558
'Cause all this Christmas stuff
seems pretty expensive.

30:04.560 --> 30:05.759
Okay, you know what,
I don't think

30:05.761 --> 30:06.827
I really wanna talk
about this anymore.

30:06.829 --> 30:09.363
Are you saving money
for college?

30:09.365 --> 30:10.396
You've got three kids.

30:10.398 --> 30:12.465
And if you
keep asking me questions

30:12.467 --> 30:14.403
it's going to be two kids.

30:20.176 --> 30:21.642
I gotcha!

30:21.644 --> 30:23.476
Yeah, look at your face!

30:23.478 --> 30:25.913
You were like, "Ah!"

30:25.915 --> 30:28.315
- Good one, Dad.
- Oh, I know.

30:28.317 --> 30:29.484
Oh, hey.

30:32.921 --> 30:34.721
Why are you putting antlers
on a bat?

30:34.723 --> 30:37.657
Uh. Well, we're making
a Christmas cave, right?

30:37.659 --> 30:38.526
Right.

30:38.528 --> 30:41.197
And what animals live in a cave?

30:41.730 --> 30:42.930
Bears.

30:42.932 --> 30:44.932
Yes. And?

30:44.934 --> 30:46.332
Other bears.

30:46.334 --> 30:48.501
No. Not... not bears.

30:50.539 --> 30:52.638
- Bats!
- Yes.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.907
Come on, Rudy.
You're in the fifth grade.

30:54.909 --> 30:57.411
And which animal
is most associated

30:57.413 --> 30:58.478
with Christmas?

30:58.480 --> 31:00.213
- Reindeer.
- Yeah!

31:00.215 --> 31:01.281
Uh, side question.

31:01.283 --> 31:02.482
What do you call
more than one reindeer.

31:02.484 --> 31:04.952
Reindeer. The plural is the same
as the singular.

31:04.954 --> 31:06.522
That's my boy. Hmm.

31:08.623 --> 31:11.224
So, this is going to be
a reindeer bat?

31:11.226 --> 31:12.326
Exactly.

31:12.328 --> 31:14.360
The first one in the world.

31:14.362 --> 31:16.762
It's gonna make our cave
even that much more Christmassy.

31:16.764 --> 31:19.232
- Good thinking.
- Yeah.

31:19.234 --> 31:20.767
How about throw in
a Christmas bear, too?

31:20.769 --> 31:22.735
Okay. See,
here's the problem, Rudy.

31:22.737 --> 31:25.771
Bears hibernate
during the winter.

31:25.773 --> 31:27.507
Now we would look pretty stupid

31:27.509 --> 31:30.978
if we had an awake bear
in our Christmas cave.

31:30.980 --> 31:32.779
Right. Sorry, Dad. Of course.

31:32.781 --> 31:34.117
No worries.

31:35.384 --> 31:36.582
A Christmas wolf.

31:36.584 --> 31:39.418
Okay, Rudy, we're doing
reindeer bats this year.

31:39.420 --> 31:41.621
That's it. Okay?

31:41.623 --> 31:43.458
- Makes total sense.
- Yes, it does.

31:45.660 --> 31:46.859
- Dad?
- Hmm?

31:46.861 --> 31:48.595
Is this reindeer bat
like the Christmas cave,

31:48.597 --> 31:49.663
where it's not a thing yet

31:49.665 --> 31:52.432
but if we do it,
it does become a thing?

31:52.434 --> 31:54.401
Because if no one ever did
a thing that wasn't a thing,

31:54.403 --> 31:55.571
then there'd be no things.

31:58.006 --> 31:59.274
Yes, son.

31:59.975 --> 32:01.276
Yes, it is.

32:04.679 --> 32:05.715
Cool.

32:10.819 --> 32:13.489
Do you see how quickly
they built this?

32:14.423 --> 32:16.556
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

32:16.558 --> 32:18.291
Now where did I put
that tensile.

32:18.293 --> 32:21.528
Well, it's almost finished.

32:21.530 --> 32:23.562
As is my life.

32:23.564 --> 32:25.331
Tanner is gonna be here
in three days.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.700
What the hell am I gonna do?

32:26.702 --> 32:27.768
You could always
tell them your parents

32:27.770 --> 32:28.969
are out of town
and meet them at Denny's

32:28.971 --> 32:30.703
- for your Christmas Eve dinner.
- Oh!

32:30.705 --> 32:31.805
That sounds depressing.

32:31.807 --> 32:34.640
Not as depressing as this.

32:34.642 --> 32:36.676
You want me to lie
to the boy that I love?

32:36.678 --> 32:38.212
Yeah.

32:38.214 --> 32:41.184
Well, I would, but he already
knows my parents are in town.

32:42.751 --> 32:44.350
Hi, Mrs. Franklin.

32:44.352 --> 32:46.819
Hello, Nicky.

32:46.821 --> 32:48.722
Stephanie, you remember
our neighbor, Mrs. Franklin.

32:48.724 --> 32:50.156
Oh, yeah. Hi.

32:50.158 --> 32:51.625
Nicky, since thousands of people
will descend on our street

32:51.627 --> 32:55.431
to see your Christmas cave,
which by the way is not a thing.

32:56.064 --> 32:57.463
That's what I said.

32:57.465 --> 32:59.499
I'll be checking in to a hotel
'till after Christmas

32:59.501 --> 33:00.834
to preserve my sanity.

33:00.836 --> 33:03.736
That means I need you to catsit
little Parsley here.

33:06.407 --> 33:08.375
Please check on Parsley
twice a day.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.676
He has feline solitude
incontinence syndrome,

33:10.678 --> 33:13.480
so if you don't pay attention
to him he, you know...

33:14.582 --> 33:16.616
Urinates everywhere.
Right. I know.

33:16.618 --> 33:18.751
You always do
a good job, young lady.

33:18.753 --> 33:21.555
How are you the offspring
of that crazy father of yours

33:21.557 --> 33:23.423
- I'll never know.
- Hmm.

33:23.425 --> 33:25.358
I guess insanity
skips a generation.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.659
Let's hope.

33:26.661 --> 33:28.361
See you in a week.

33:28.363 --> 33:29.829
Oh, my god.

33:29.831 --> 33:31.431
That's the cat
you were telling me about,

33:31.433 --> 33:32.732
the one that pees on everything.

33:32.734 --> 33:34.100
Yup. That's Parsley.

33:34.102 --> 33:36.636
He should be called Pissy.

33:36.638 --> 33:39.138
Well, the good news is,
he only pees when he's lonely,

33:39.140 --> 33:40.272
which is all the time.

33:40.274 --> 33:41.674
And then,
I have to clean it all up.

33:41.676 --> 33:44.144
You could always sneak him
into the neighbor's house.

33:44.146 --> 33:47.250
The Crenshaws seem pretty gross
and they might not notice.

33:48.850 --> 33:51.117
Steph...

33:51.119 --> 33:53.119
Do you know what I could do
with these keys?

33:53.121 --> 33:55.688
Let yourself into
a urine soaked house?

33:55.690 --> 33:58.625
I haven't given Tanner
my address yet.

33:58.627 --> 34:00.460
I could give him the address
of the next door.

34:00.462 --> 34:01.560
And we could have dinner there

34:01.562 --> 34:03.629
instead of here
with my crazy family.

34:03.631 --> 34:04.463
That is some seriously

34:04.465 --> 34:05.531
evil genius stuff, Nicky.

34:05.533 --> 34:07.800
- And I love it, but, um...
- What?

34:07.802 --> 34:10.704
Isn't Tanner expecting
to meet your parents?

34:10.706 --> 34:13.607
Well, maybe it's time we put all
those improv classes to use.

34:13.609 --> 34:16.409
We hire actors
to play my parents.

34:16.411 --> 34:17.777
We hire actors?

34:17.779 --> 34:19.413
Oh, that's brilliant.

34:19.415 --> 34:20.880
And we could use
our pro-improv skills

34:20.882 --> 34:21.982
to direct them.

34:21.984 --> 34:24.884
Yes! This is gonna be
so much fun.

34:24.886 --> 34:28.154
And we'll never see my crazy,
stupid Christmas family.

34:28.156 --> 34:30.157
Stephanie and Nicky
save the day.

34:30.159 --> 34:33.427
All thanks to Pissy the cat.

34:33.429 --> 34:34.795
<i>You're sure
your parents don't care</i>

34:34.797 --> 34:36.429
<i>if we use your house, Steph?</i>

34:36.431 --> 34:38.498
<i>They might care
if they knew.</i>

34:42.638 --> 34:44.572
Mm!

34:48.610 --> 34:50.976
Quite an impressive turnout.

34:50.978 --> 34:53.447
I know right? I guess
we're the only thing casting

34:53.449 --> 34:54.713
in Santa Clarita
for Christmas Eve.

34:54.715 --> 34:56.516
Go figure, right?

34:56.518 --> 34:57.884
Um, did you ever figure out

34:57.886 --> 34:59.284
how to work the hologram thing
without being there?

34:59.286 --> 35:01.855
Archie from computer club says
he can make a program

35:01.857 --> 35:03.456
that puts it on auto Santa.

35:03.458 --> 35:04.493
Great!

35:08.464 --> 35:10.797
Steph, this is crazy, we're not
gonna have enough time.

35:10.799 --> 35:12.732
Hey, we totally got this.

35:12.734 --> 35:14.733
We'll plow through
the auditions,

35:14.735 --> 35:16.837
whip the actors into shape
while you spend Christmas Eve

35:16.839 --> 35:18.471
with your fam
in the Christmas cave.

35:18.473 --> 35:19.540
No one will be the wiser

35:19.542 --> 35:20.907
when Tanner and his dad
show up tonight.

35:20.909 --> 35:22.241
Honestly, I wish

35:22.243 --> 35:24.177
we had rash medicine commercial
to cast on the side

35:24.179 --> 35:25.881
because this just seems
too easy.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.616
All right.

35:29.618 --> 35:31.250
- Let's do this.
- Good.

35:34.922 --> 35:36.422
"Hello, Tanner.

35:36.424 --> 35:40.527
It is so nice to finally meet
the boy that my daughter met

35:40.529 --> 35:41.697
last summer."

35:42.897 --> 35:44.764
- That was great.
- Yeah.

35:44.766 --> 35:47.500
There's not going to be a script
for the actual performance

35:47.502 --> 35:48.934
just a lot of improv.

35:48.936 --> 35:50.369
Improv?

35:50.371 --> 35:52.838
Yeah, so why don't you go ahead
and improv with Stephanie

35:52.840 --> 35:55.509
right now, she'll pretend
to be Tanner's dad.

35:55.511 --> 35:59.447
So, Mrs. Winters, I hear
your daughter plays the tuba.

36:01.782 --> 36:02.916
Hello?

36:15.697 --> 36:17.264
- I'm gonna go with no on her.
- Mm.

36:17.266 --> 36:18.532
Yeah, okay.

36:18.534 --> 36:20.699
So I know the ad said
that it's a paid gig,

36:20.701 --> 36:22.936
but I can only afford
to pay 50 dollars.

36:22.938 --> 36:24.371
Pay us?

36:24.373 --> 36:26.739
Could maybe pay little bit more
if there was fight scene,

36:26.741 --> 36:29.074
I can even fight myself.
Here just... just watch.

36:29.076 --> 36:30.478
Just...

36:33.281 --> 36:36.715
Oh, my...

36:36.717 --> 36:39.552
Uh, it's a little something
I invented called

36:39.554 --> 36:40.753
a stop monologue.

36:40.755 --> 36:43.024
- It's copyrighted.
- Ah.

36:43.958 --> 36:44.991
No.

36:44.993 --> 36:47.826
So, I think I can dance.

36:48.964 --> 36:51.030
Oh, no! He's too hip-hop.

36:51.032 --> 36:54.800
No, um, there's no dancing
involved in this role.

36:56.071 --> 36:57.637
And then I was
in <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

36:57.639 --> 37:00.574
The original production.

37:00.576 --> 37:02.978
And I play the fiddler
before he got out of the roof.

37:04.612 --> 37:07.646
Thank you so much for coming in.

37:07.648 --> 37:10.784
I wore the mat
that had played the roof.

37:10.786 --> 37:13.954
- That makes no sense.
- I know, I'm Jewish. It doesn't.

37:13.956 --> 37:15.721
Would you like to hear
my English accent?

37:15.723 --> 37:17.657
My father's not English.

37:17.659 --> 37:19.692
Uh, hello, guv'nor.

37:19.694 --> 37:20.726
What-o!

37:20.728 --> 37:22.996
Chim, chim, cher-ee!

37:22.998 --> 37:25.067
Can you believe,
I've never even been to England.

37:27.768 --> 37:28.934
- Yes.
- Mm.

37:28.936 --> 37:32.507
I also sing
the greatest music of all.

37:35.009 --> 37:36.710
Campfire songs.

37:36.712 --> 37:40.346
<i>♪ Oh, Susanna
Oh, don't you cry for me ♪</i>

37:40.348 --> 37:42.648
How the hell
did a Broadway actor

37:42.650 --> 37:44.817
end up in Santa Clarita,
you may ask.

37:44.819 --> 37:46.554
- I really don't...
- Go ahead, ask.

37:51.826 --> 37:53.860
How did a Broadway actor end...

37:53.862 --> 37:55.895
Timing! You think timing.

37:55.897 --> 37:58.331
I interrupted you in the middle
of you asking me a question.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.936
Ask me again, it's always funny.

38:03.170 --> 38:05.371
Please, please, I need this.
All right.

38:05.373 --> 38:07.007
Look, let me be the understudy.

38:07.009 --> 38:09.175
Look, I... I'll be
a great understudy.

38:09.177 --> 38:11.143
Does the part require nudity?

38:11.145 --> 38:13.045
Because I prefer it.

38:13.047 --> 38:15.715
Full frontal if possible.

38:15.717 --> 38:18.050
And in conclusion,
I just want to tell you

38:18.052 --> 38:20.887
how pleased I am
to meet Nicky's boyfriend.

38:20.889 --> 38:22.925
And that, I too am not keen
on Christmas.

38:24.726 --> 38:26.659
You nailed it.

38:27.795 --> 38:29.429
Thank you, you are too kind.

38:29.431 --> 38:31.197
Are you available
to be my dad full-time?

38:31.199 --> 38:33.933
Just kidding. Mostly.

38:33.935 --> 38:35.768
Anyway, you're hired.

38:35.770 --> 38:38.371
And you're all right
that this gig is for tonight?

38:38.373 --> 38:40.072
I know it's Christmas Eve.

38:40.074 --> 38:42.675
Are you kidding?
Christmas is here.

38:42.677 --> 38:43.679
Acting...

38:44.446 --> 38:45.648
is here.

38:47.748 --> 38:49.449
- Mm.
- Commitment to the craft.

38:49.451 --> 38:50.349
I like that.

38:50.351 --> 38:52.851
I humbly accept this position.

38:52.853 --> 38:54.186
Quick question though,

38:54.188 --> 38:55.121
will I have to be
drinking alcohol in this gig?

38:55.123 --> 38:56.588
- No.
- Oh, good.

38:56.590 --> 39:00.159
Wouldn't want to set off the old
alcohol monitoring bracelet.

39:03.964 --> 39:05.165
It's fine.

39:05.167 --> 39:07.069
I'm hired, right?

39:08.837 --> 39:10.804
I also need a ride home.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.237
No.

39:12.239 --> 39:15.241
Ms. James,
it is so great to see you.

39:15.243 --> 39:16.641
Well, it's great to see you...

39:16.643 --> 39:20.746
Do I... do I know you,
were you in one of my classes?

39:20.748 --> 39:23.882
Uh.

39:23.884 --> 39:26.719
That's so funny. Isn't it funny?

39:26.721 --> 39:28.154
She's not joking, is she?

39:28.156 --> 39:29.788
- Mm-mm
- Okay, yes. Yes!

39:29.790 --> 39:32.058
Yes, I'm in all of your classes.

39:32.060 --> 39:35.962
They're my favorite.
Took them last year, too.

39:35.964 --> 39:39.132
Yes, you showed great promise.

39:39.134 --> 39:40.733
I wanna say...

39:40.735 --> 39:42.168
Saaar...

39:42.170 --> 39:43.770
Stephanie

39:43.772 --> 39:45.771
- Stephanie.
- Stephanie.

39:45.773 --> 39:47.040
Of course,
your name is Stephanie.

39:47.042 --> 39:49.808
Yeah. Yeah, I swept up
after every rehearsal.

39:49.810 --> 39:53.145
I actually, knitted that sweater
you're currently wearing,

39:53.147 --> 39:55.949
I started that
Facebook fan club for you.

39:55.951 --> 39:57.150
Now it's coming back to me.

39:57.152 --> 39:58.317
I remember. You're the one

39:58.319 --> 39:59.619
who always wanted
to do the kissing scenes

39:59.621 --> 40:01.920
with all the handsome boys.
Uh, shame on you.

40:01.922 --> 40:03.822
- That's our Steph.
- That's me.

40:03.824 --> 40:05.157
I want you to know
that I've read the material,

40:05.159 --> 40:07.196
I have absorbed the character,
I am...

40:08.864 --> 40:10.764
very good at improv...

40:10.766 --> 40:13.766
The imagination is limitless.

40:13.768 --> 40:15.768
If you let it be ladies.

40:15.770 --> 40:17.003
Great! Then let's improv.

40:17.005 --> 40:20.643
I'll be Nicky's boyfriend's dad.
Okay, got it?

40:22.076 --> 40:23.476
Let's all do a breath.

40:25.947 --> 40:28.148
I have a deviated septum
so it's harder to get it in.

40:28.150 --> 40:30.753
Don't breathe out.
Don't breathe out.

40:31.252 --> 40:32.951
No breathe out.

40:32.953 --> 40:34.052
Breathe out.

40:34.054 --> 40:37.956
Let's get ready to improv!

40:39.927 --> 40:41.561
- Okay. Yeah.
- Here we go.

40:45.299 --> 40:47.199
Well, hello, gentlemen,
it's so nice to...

40:47.201 --> 40:48.701
Nicky.

40:48.703 --> 40:51.904
I can see where your boyfriend
gets all of his charms from.

40:51.906 --> 40:54.940
Mrs. Winters, I heard
your daughter plays the tuba.

40:54.942 --> 40:56.342
Uh, plays it? Mm, I dunno.

40:56.344 --> 40:59.012
I think she rocks
the hizouse with it.

41:04.052 --> 41:05.451
Nice touch.

41:05.453 --> 41:08.087
That actually gave me
legit embarrassing mom cringe.

41:08.089 --> 41:09.989
Well...

41:09.991 --> 41:11.123
I think you're perfect
for the role.

41:11.125 --> 41:12.190
- Yeah.
- You're sure you're all right

41:12.192 --> 41:14.259
with doing this
even though it's tonight

41:14.261 --> 41:15.895
and it's Christmas Eve?

41:15.897 --> 41:18.096
Christmas, uh, god.
I can't stand Christmas.

41:18.098 --> 41:19.565
Perfect!

41:19.567 --> 41:21.534
What are the odds we find
an actress who hates Christmas

41:21.536 --> 41:23.235
- as much as I do.
- Right?

41:23.237 --> 41:26.206
I'm kidding! I love Christmas!

41:26.208 --> 41:28.077
I'm just a really
talented actress.

41:28.944 --> 41:29.978
Told ya.

41:30.911 --> 41:32.011
Uh-huh.

41:32.013 --> 41:34.079
Please, I need this
for my resume.

41:34.081 --> 41:35.380
I'm a great understudy

41:35.382 --> 41:36.616
and you won't even know
I'm around.

41:36.618 --> 41:38.253
- Mm-mm.
- Because I'm stealthy.

41:41.255 --> 41:42.257
See?

41:44.125 --> 41:45.291
Did I mention I can juggle?

41:45.293 --> 41:46.228
- Oh, my god.
- No...

41:49.197 --> 41:50.199
Actors.

41:52.333 --> 41:55.134
<i>♪ Kitty cat, kitty cat

41:55.136 --> 41:58.003

42:20.161 --> 42:22.898
Wow.
It really is a Christmas cave.

42:25.667 --> 42:27.967
Okay. We need
to keep these closed.

42:27.969 --> 42:29.168
That's the guy
you're pretending to be,

42:29.170 --> 42:30.036
he can't see you.

42:30.038 --> 42:32.237
Uh, Bradley, this is Ms. James.

42:32.239 --> 42:34.907
- And Ms. James this...
- We've met.

42:34.909 --> 42:37.043
<i>We did West Side Story together.</i>

42:37.045 --> 42:39.244
You played Maria to my Tony.

42:39.246 --> 42:41.346
You're Tony? You're Tony?

42:42.583 --> 42:44.150
So you guys
have already played a couple.

42:44.152 --> 42:45.585
For one night.

42:45.587 --> 42:48.621
Until he was unmercifully
replaced by the understudy.

42:48.623 --> 42:49.922
Was there a problem?

42:49.924 --> 42:52.257
You're not supposed to use
a real switchblade.

42:52.259 --> 42:54.192
I was acquitted
of all charges, okay?

42:54.194 --> 42:56.663
And replacing me
with the understudy, not cool.

42:56.665 --> 42:58.398
Not cool.

42:58.400 --> 42:59.965
Still have nightmares.

42:59.967 --> 43:02.101
Okay! So, um, moving on.

43:02.103 --> 43:04.637
Uh, Bradley, you'll be playing
Nicky's dad, Chris.

43:04.639 --> 43:07.940
And Ms. James, you'll be playing
Nicky's mom, Fran.

43:07.942 --> 43:09.375
Fran. Got it.

43:10.777 --> 43:13.445
Uh, we only have about
seven hours until they arrive.

43:13.447 --> 43:15.081
So, uh, let's rehearse.

43:15.083 --> 43:17.050
Uh, Nicky,
you be Tanner's dad, Lance,

43:17.052 --> 43:18.217
and I'll be Tanner.

43:18.219 --> 43:20.085
And action!

43:20.087 --> 43:22.221
Lance, it is so nice
to meet you.

43:22.223 --> 43:24.223
Yes, it's so nice to meet you.

43:24.225 --> 43:27.025
And, Tanner, what a lovely name.

43:27.027 --> 43:29.395
- What a lovely name.
- Wait, cut. Um...

43:29.397 --> 43:32.498
Bradley, you're just repeating
whatever Ms. James says.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.168
I was being a husband
in tune with his wife.

43:35.170 --> 43:37.070
Okay, uh, well...

43:37.072 --> 43:39.438
Let's maybe dial that back
just a little bit, okay?

43:39.440 --> 43:41.974
And action.

43:41.976 --> 43:42.942
Lance, Tanner,

43:42.944 --> 43:44.110
- how was your flight?
- Oh.

43:44.112 --> 43:46.679
That's a stupid question, honey.

43:46.681 --> 43:49.117
And dial back on the harsh,
too, please.

43:49.985 --> 43:51.317
Actors.

43:51.319 --> 43:52.454
I know.

43:53.388 --> 43:54.853
The flight was swell.

43:54.855 --> 43:58.224
Great, great. Now, what part
of Connecticut are you from?

43:58.226 --> 44:00.425
The nice part.

44:00.427 --> 44:02.395
No, no, I cannot laugh at that.

44:02.397 --> 44:03.496
- Why not?
- I don't think

44:03.498 --> 44:05.498
that my character would
find it funny.

44:05.500 --> 44:09.001
Can you stop whining
and just be professional?

44:09.003 --> 44:10.737
- Oh, professional?
- Uh, yeah.

44:10.739 --> 44:12.438
You're a drama teacher, okay?

44:12.440 --> 44:15.440
You're a babysitter
with a scenery budget.

44:15.442 --> 44:18.210
All right. I'll have you know,
I was on <i>Law & Order.</i>

44:18.212 --> 44:19.779
Oh, I know.

44:19.781 --> 44:21.780
Because you brought the DVD
to rehearsal

44:21.782 --> 44:23.483
and made everybody watch it.

44:23.485 --> 44:25.418
Your part was a member
of the jury.

44:25.420 --> 44:27.119
Your whole part consisted

44:27.121 --> 44:29.489
of nodding during the testimony.
This is it.

44:29.491 --> 44:31.491
- Look, I can nod.
- Guys...

44:31.493 --> 44:34.494
I'll have you know, I nodded
to S. Epatha Merkerson.

44:34.496 --> 44:36.529
Who have you
ever nodded to, sir?

44:36.531 --> 44:39.032
To whom have you nodded?

44:39.034 --> 44:41.199
I rest my case, you alcoholic.

44:41.201 --> 44:42.268
That's supposed to be anonymous.

44:42.270 --> 44:44.404
Everyone can see
your ankle monitor.

44:44.406 --> 44:46.505
Hope you guys hired
an understudy for this hack.

44:46.507 --> 44:48.775
- You take that back.
- Okay, settle down...

44:48.777 --> 44:49.909
We only have a few hours

44:49.911 --> 44:51.177
until my boyfriend
and his dad get...

44:51.179 --> 44:54.179
I refuse to go on
until this lumping lummox

44:54.181 --> 44:57.083
apologizes to me
for mocking my resume.

44:57.085 --> 44:58.351
Listen to me!

44:58.353 --> 45:00.085
For the first time in my life

45:00.087 --> 45:01.753
I might be able
to have the Christmas I want.

45:01.755 --> 45:05.058
A Christmas where I can relax
and be normal.

45:05.060 --> 45:07.462
Normal! I need to be normal!

45:15.136 --> 45:17.072
I need to go help my mother now.

45:22.143 --> 45:23.545
Hope she doesn't talk
to her mom that way.

45:30.118 --> 45:32.451
Look at the way you manipulate
those cheeseballs.

45:32.453 --> 45:33.853
How many other girls
can do that?

45:33.855 --> 45:35.621
Mighty few I'd say.

45:35.623 --> 45:37.623
I'm the envy of all my friends.

45:37.625 --> 45:40.092
Oh, you sarcastic young woman.

45:40.094 --> 45:41.460
There's gonna be a lot
of hungry visitors

45:41.462 --> 45:43.596
to the Christmas cave
expecting their Christmas treats

45:43.598 --> 45:46.567
in a few hours, and those balls
will not disappoint.

45:47.802 --> 45:49.634
You don't hear it, do you, Mom?

45:49.636 --> 45:51.572
There's no food
like Christmas food.

45:52.840 --> 45:54.306
Christmas food.

45:54.308 --> 45:55.509
Christmas food.

45:56.578 --> 45:58.280
What the Blitzen
are you going on about?

46:00.281 --> 46:02.514
Mom, I gotta go
check on Stephanie,

46:02.516 --> 46:05.217
because she's Jewish
and it's Christmas,

46:05.219 --> 46:06.585
so, you know,

46:06.587 --> 46:08.621
it's a difficult time
for her people.

46:08.623 --> 46:10.288
Why do you have to go
this minute?

46:10.290 --> 46:12.159
Because reasons. Jewish reasons.

46:13.527 --> 46:16.031
Gosh, it sounds like
so much work to be Jewish.

46:35.315 --> 46:37.282
Why are you coming in
through the window?

46:37.284 --> 46:39.418
Rudy almost saw me
coming here, the little twerp.

46:39.420 --> 46:41.186
But that's the least
of our problems.

46:41.188 --> 46:43.588
Chill, woman. Your Hollywood
parents are doing great.

46:43.590 --> 46:46.458
I am merely a vessel
for the spirit of the theater.

46:46.460 --> 46:49.262
If by spirit, you mean vodka.

46:49.264 --> 46:50.462
We're screwed.

46:50.464 --> 46:53.299
Why, Captain Bummer
of the SS Bring Me Down?

46:53.301 --> 46:54.866
Because it will be
kind of obvious

46:54.868 --> 46:56.636
if Tanner and his dad
show up for dinner

46:56.638 --> 46:58.373
and there's no dinner.

46:59.574 --> 47:02.708
Uh, yeah. We forgot about that.

47:02.710 --> 47:05.344
Just so you know, I don't cook.

47:05.346 --> 47:07.612
But my character

47:07.614 --> 47:09.315
doesn't either.

47:09.317 --> 47:10.583
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:10.585 --> 47:11.784
Can you save my life?

47:11.786 --> 47:14.186
And go buy dinner
for six people? Done.

47:14.188 --> 47:15.887
And remember,
nothing too Christmassy.

47:15.889 --> 47:18.558
Double done.
No red or green foods.

47:18.560 --> 47:20.429
Ugh. Wish I was adopted.

47:22.429 --> 47:23.730
Well, what are we supposed
to do now?

47:23.732 --> 47:25.630
Consider this intermission.

47:25.632 --> 47:27.333
Anybody have a screwdriver?

47:27.335 --> 47:28.934
What would happen
if I poured alcohol

47:28.936 --> 47:31.204
on that thing?

47:31.206 --> 47:32.538
I would go to jail.

47:32.540 --> 47:35.541
And worse, you'd be wasting
peppermint schnapps

47:44.585 --> 47:45.619
Oh, this?

47:46.587 --> 47:48.622
Why, thank you.

47:51.491 --> 47:53.458
You think the color
brings out my eyes?

47:53.460 --> 47:56.197
Oh, Tanner, stop.

47:57.931 --> 47:59.167
Hmm.

48:01.502 --> 48:04.270
Those cranberries cool yet, hon?
We should put them in the...

48:04.272 --> 48:06.538
Oh!

48:06.540 --> 48:09.241
- Oh, no. Honey.
- Oh, my god.

48:09.243 --> 48:10.643
Your pretty dress.

48:10.645 --> 48:13.712
Oh, oh. I'm so sorry.

48:13.714 --> 48:15.614
Oh, no.

48:15.616 --> 48:18.016
Ugh, the one year I don't have
backup cranberries.

48:18.018 --> 48:19.518
Seriously?

48:19.520 --> 48:20.753
I'm sorry, go change.

48:20.755 --> 48:21.853
You know what,
you're gonna have to go change.

48:21.855 --> 48:23.655
You gotta work
that hologram Santa.

48:23.657 --> 48:25.527
I'm so sorry, honey.

48:26.728 --> 48:28.363
Go get yourself cleaned up.

48:29.563 --> 48:32.297
No backup cranberries.

48:32.299 --> 48:33.799
Oh!

48:33.801 --> 48:35.636
I can't believe this.

48:37.505 --> 48:39.704
Why the drama? You look great.

48:39.706 --> 48:41.741
That was the dress, Steph.

48:41.743 --> 48:43.643
Hey, no, no, no.

48:43.645 --> 48:45.110
You look amazing.

48:45.112 --> 48:48.413
And Tanner's gonna love you
even more than he already does.

48:48.415 --> 48:50.715
Because I cannot live in a world
where Nicky Winters is not

48:50.717 --> 48:53.286
with the man of her dreams.

48:53.288 --> 48:54.688
That's kind of codependent.

48:56.424 --> 48:58.690
I love it.

48:58.692 --> 48:59.659
You look great.

48:59.661 --> 49:00.992
- This is gonna be great.
- Yeah?

49:00.994 --> 49:02.661
And we got this, you know we do.

49:02.663 --> 49:05.431
- Okay?
- Okay.

49:05.433 --> 49:07.301
- Hm.
- You look good in yellow.

49:16.777 --> 49:19.311
Hi, are you ready to go
inside the cave?

49:19.313 --> 49:21.012
- Yeah.
- You're excited? Yeah.

49:21.014 --> 49:22.581
- Yeah.
- Exactly. Excited.

49:22.583 --> 49:24.583
George Bailey to Clarence?

49:24.585 --> 49:26.585
George Bailey to Clarence?

49:26.587 --> 49:27.853
Come in, Clarence.

49:27.855 --> 49:29.355
<i>This is Clarence.</i>

49:29.357 --> 49:30.489
Roger that.

49:30.491 --> 49:31.956
How's the crowd?

49:31.958 --> 49:35.328
Do we need additional security
or are they well behaved?

49:35.330 --> 49:36.728
I've got them under control.

49:36.730 --> 49:37.829
But if there's any trouble,

49:37.831 --> 49:39.465
I'll let the hot cider
do the talking.

49:39.467 --> 49:42.804
<i>Roger that, Clarence.
Ho, ho, ho, hooraybell.</i>

49:48.476 --> 49:49.641
That's pretty good.

49:49.643 --> 49:51.744
Well, that's your everyday
Santa dance.

49:51.746 --> 49:54.579
I kinda jailbroke this machine
and I put it on a loop,

49:54.581 --> 49:56.648
so it should keep on running
for the rest of the night.

49:56.650 --> 49:58.219
All right.

50:03.790 --> 50:05.123
You know,
my psychic just told me

50:05.125 --> 50:07.125
that my spirit animal is a wolf.

50:07.127 --> 50:08.395
You like wolves?

50:12.567 --> 50:13.632
Sure.

50:13.634 --> 50:15.467
Steph said something
about a tip?

50:15.469 --> 50:16.768
Oh, right.

50:16.770 --> 50:20.405
Um, here is 15 dollars.

50:20.407 --> 50:21.710
You're sure this'll work?

50:22.576 --> 50:23.744
I'm 15 dollars sure.

50:24.545 --> 50:26.378
Huh. Okay.

50:43.831 --> 50:44.866
Whoops.

50:47.802 --> 50:48.634
Rudy finally took
a bathroom break,

50:48.636 --> 50:50.536
so I could get over here.

50:50.538 --> 50:52.505
Okay, so...

50:52.507 --> 50:53.973
The Christmas trees
are good to go,

50:53.975 --> 50:56.675
and the dancing Santa loop
should hold them 'till Easter.

51:00.447 --> 51:02.415
Oh, shoot I forgot
about the cat.

51:02.417 --> 51:03.750
Calm down.

51:03.752 --> 51:04.851
Hello, Parsley.

51:04.853 --> 51:07.753
We're gonna put you
in here, okay?

51:07.755 --> 51:09.822
Okay, let's go.

51:09.824 --> 51:14.159
You are the weirdest cat
in the whole wide world.

51:14.161 --> 51:15.527
Here's your little bed.

51:15.529 --> 51:18.831
And your food, and your toys,
and your litter box.

51:18.833 --> 51:20.866
Remember how to use that, okay?

51:23.703 --> 51:26.572
Okay.

51:26.574 --> 51:28.541
You're not gonna believe this,
but Tanner texted me,

51:28.543 --> 51:30.875
his flight landed early.
So, he's on his way here, now.

51:30.877 --> 51:32.445
As in, not later, now.

51:32.447 --> 51:34.646
Uh. Well, dinner is served.

51:34.648 --> 51:36.614
Or, as my people would say,

51:36.616 --> 51:38.519
bon appétit.

51:43.757 --> 51:44.759
What is this?

51:45.493 --> 51:46.692
They're latkes.

51:46.694 --> 51:49.494
No, what is... What is all this?

51:49.496 --> 51:51.864
Uh, where did you expect me
to find a full meal

51:51.866 --> 51:54.166
on Christmas Eve?
It was either Jewish Deli

51:54.168 --> 51:56.201
or China, China, China
on 14th Street.

51:56.203 --> 51:58.503
And honey, that food
is bad, bad, bad.

51:59.906 --> 52:01.942
Oh, crap, crap, crap. He's here!

52:06.746 --> 52:08.246
Get up. Get up, they're here!

52:08.248 --> 52:09.348
Already?

52:09.350 --> 52:10.416
I didn't get
to take my power nap.

52:10.418 --> 52:11.750
All right, listen up, cast.

52:11.752 --> 52:14.253
You know what they say,
bad dress rehearsal, great show.

52:14.255 --> 52:15.887
And I know that in my heart,
you guys can...

52:15.889 --> 52:17.655
Stop! Steph.

52:17.657 --> 52:19.257
- Enough with the pep talk.
- Sorry.

52:20.728 --> 52:21.730
This is it.

52:22.529 --> 52:24.730
Okay.

52:24.732 --> 52:26.601
Are you sure we can
actually pull this off?

52:27.668 --> 52:29.735
It's not too late to back out?

52:29.737 --> 52:30.969
You can tell them the truth,

52:30.971 --> 52:32.570
and take the chances
with your real family.

52:32.572 --> 52:34.907
Because once you open that door,

52:34.909 --> 52:37.509
there's no turning back, okay?

52:37.511 --> 52:39.677
You will fall down
the rabbit hole of deception

52:39.679 --> 52:41.850
and trickery,
like nothing you've ever known.

52:43.683 --> 52:44.484
Sounds good.

52:46.888 --> 52:48.786
- Nicky!
- Tanner!

52:48.788 --> 52:50.524
- I missed you.
- I missed you too!

52:52.259 --> 52:54.626
Who's this boy
manhandling my daughter?

52:54.628 --> 52:56.529
Oh.

52:56.531 --> 52:58.596
Hah! I'm just kidding.
I'm the dad of this family.

52:58.598 --> 52:59.931
I'm Tanner.

52:59.933 --> 53:02.000
- This is my, uh, dad, Lance.
- Hi. Hey.

53:02.002 --> 53:03.802
- Uh, hello.
- Uh, nice to me you, Mr....

53:03.804 --> 53:04.869
Uh, call me Lance.

53:04.871 --> 53:06.808
This is my friend Stephanie.

53:07.842 --> 53:09.041
Very nice to meet you.

53:09.043 --> 53:11.744
Uh, what's going on next door?

53:14.681 --> 53:16.949
Oh! it's, um...

53:16.951 --> 53:17.985
Uh, Dad?

53:20.253 --> 53:21.686
Dad?

53:21.688 --> 53:23.255
- That's me!
- Hm.

53:23.257 --> 53:25.623
Well, hello gentlemen!

53:25.625 --> 53:26.724
So good to see you!

53:26.726 --> 53:28.893
Let's not keep
our guests waiting.

53:28.895 --> 53:30.295
Come on in, boys!

53:30.297 --> 53:31.329
Okay.

53:31.331 --> 53:33.565
That's how
a professional does it.

53:33.567 --> 53:34.701
Guys, welcome!

53:54.654 --> 53:55.554
Great bread!

53:55.556 --> 53:57.559
Mm-hmm.

53:58.726 --> 54:00.960
Yes. So...

54:02.096 --> 54:03.665
...dry.

54:04.998 --> 54:06.364
Oh, um.

54:06.366 --> 54:07.733
I'll go get you some water.

54:07.735 --> 54:08.570
Okay.

54:10.337 --> 54:12.036
Are you Jewish?

54:12.038 --> 54:14.038
No.

54:14.040 --> 54:15.340
We just love matzo.

54:15.342 --> 54:17.610
So dry. Goes down scratchy.

54:17.612 --> 54:19.581
It's, it's kind of a Cali thing.

54:28.889 --> 54:30.788
So, Tanner!

54:30.790 --> 54:32.757
How do you like Santa Clarita?

54:32.759 --> 54:33.925
It's a little warmer
than Boston, huh?

54:35.763 --> 54:36.996
Connecticut.

54:36.998 --> 54:38.697
- What?
- Drunk, say "what?"

54:38.699 --> 54:40.099
What?

54:41.469 --> 54:43.902
Remember, Dad? I...

54:43.904 --> 54:45.904
I swear his memory is going.

54:45.906 --> 54:48.009
Tanner and his dad live
in Connecticut.

54:49.677 --> 54:51.409
<i>This is George Bailey,
to Clarence.</i>

54:51.411 --> 54:52.344
<i>George Bailey to Clarence.</i>

54:52.346 --> 54:53.411
<i>Have you seen Nicky?</i>

54:53.413 --> 54:54.813
<i>I'm about to open the cave,</i>

54:54.815 --> 54:57.282
<i>and I can't do it without her.
Over.</i>

54:57.284 --> 54:58.817
<i>That's a negative, George.</i>

54:58.819 --> 55:02.121
<i>She disappoints yet again. Over.</i>

55:02.123 --> 55:03.721
You know, how come
you never pronounce

55:03.723 --> 55:05.090
the second C in Connecticut?

55:05.092 --> 55:06.391
"Connect-ticut."

55:06.393 --> 55:07.794
That would sound weird, right?

55:09.063 --> 55:10.663
Makes you think, though,
doesn't it?

55:10.665 --> 55:12.697
Oh, no. It does not.

55:14.868 --> 55:16.201
It's great here, Mr. Winters.

55:16.203 --> 55:17.936
It's nice to be in the sun
during Christmas time.

55:17.938 --> 55:18.969
Christmas time!

55:18.971 --> 55:21.739
Christmas time is here.

55:21.741 --> 55:23.074
Right here!

55:23.076 --> 55:24.742
And also next door.

55:24.744 --> 55:27.378
Next door is having
a special time.

55:27.380 --> 55:29.848
Right, in the nick of time,

55:29.850 --> 55:31.585
you might say.

55:32.118 --> 55:33.153
Oh.

55:33.821 --> 55:35.154
Oh!

55:35.156 --> 55:38.157
I'm sorry, I have to go work
on the main course.

55:38.159 --> 55:39.824
That matzoh can't ball itself.

55:39.826 --> 55:41.393
Oh, right?

55:41.395 --> 55:42.728
Excuse me...

55:43.697 --> 55:45.963
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

55:48.134 --> 55:49.703
We're having this stuff
for dinner, too?

55:52.005 --> 55:54.005
Hm.

55:54.007 --> 55:55.074
"Connect-ticut."

55:55.076 --> 55:56.007
- Yeah.
- Oh!

55:56.009 --> 55:57.476
Again!

55:57.478 --> 55:58.811
Yeah.

55:58.813 --> 56:00.846
I should take
all those genealogy tests.

56:00.848 --> 56:02.683
Oh, god.

56:03.484 --> 56:04.717
- Hey.
- Oh!

56:05.920 --> 56:07.219
What the hell
are you doing here, Doug?

56:07.221 --> 56:08.987
Being an understudy.

56:08.989 --> 56:11.023
I'm ready to go on,
at a moment's notice,

56:11.025 --> 56:12.925
and play your dad.

56:12.927 --> 56:15.728
A great artist
never gives up.

56:15.730 --> 56:17.996
J.K. Rowling
was rejected 12 times

56:17.998 --> 56:20.132
before they published
<i>Harry Potter.</i>

56:20.134 --> 56:21.866
Right.

56:21.868 --> 56:24.069
Um.

56:24.071 --> 56:25.839
<i>Expelliarmus, weirdo.</i>

56:27.808 --> 56:29.507
That's not a real spell.

56:33.147 --> 56:35.750
Excuse me.

56:37.016 --> 56:39.817
Hey, look at you.

56:39.819 --> 56:40.985
I'm a candy cane!

56:40.987 --> 56:42.887
Yeah, and a real sweet one,
I'll bet.

56:42.889 --> 56:45.056
That's cute.

56:45.058 --> 56:47.259
Excuse me.
Can I see your access pass?

56:47.261 --> 56:50.094
Leave her alone, Rudy.

56:50.096 --> 56:53.532
If you like unsecure areas,
then that's on you.

56:53.534 --> 56:55.933
Your father's just about to open
the Christmas cave.

56:55.935 --> 56:58.872
Okay, we are just about ready
for a...

57:00.907 --> 57:02.241
- What?
- It's just...

57:02.243 --> 57:04.208
You're not wearing your costume.

57:04.210 --> 57:06.545
Dad, no. No costume, okay?

57:06.547 --> 57:08.514
I'm... I'm the dancing hologram.

57:08.516 --> 57:09.915
That's it.

57:09.917 --> 57:12.152
Now, let's...

57:12.987 --> 57:15.156
open the Christmas cave!

57:17.023 --> 57:19.491
Okay...

57:22.496 --> 57:24.929
She didn't put on her costume.

57:24.931 --> 57:27.833
Why is this lady
stopping Christmas?

57:27.835 --> 57:29.067
Where's her Christmas spirit?

57:29.069 --> 57:31.069
Why do you hate America?

57:33.206 --> 57:36.743
Nicky, it's not really the same
if you're not in a costume.

57:40.014 --> 57:42.181
Doe she even care
about this holiday?

57:43.884 --> 57:44.916
Okay.

57:44.918 --> 57:46.250
Come on, sweetie.

57:46.252 --> 57:47.219
I'll you put it on.
You can't put it on by yourself.

57:47.221 --> 57:49.288
- Here we go.
- Okay.

57:49.290 --> 57:51.290
Slight delay, but not to panic!

57:51.292 --> 57:54.125
The gate's opening
is moments away!

57:55.962 --> 57:57.798
It take...
It takes a team.

57:58.331 --> 58:00.232
It was mostly me.

58:00.234 --> 58:01.567
And then the Sherpa said,

58:01.569 --> 58:04.235
"I've never seen a white guy
with calves like yours."

58:07.907 --> 58:09.710
Hm.

58:11.011 --> 58:13.978
So, is that your only move?
Nodding, huh?

58:13.980 --> 58:15.313
<i>West Side Story was my big break</i>

58:15.315 --> 58:17.983
and you ruined it for me,
you booze-back loser.

58:17.985 --> 58:19.384
Oh, honey!

58:19.386 --> 58:21.253
You don't have to whisper
sweet nothings in my ear.

58:21.255 --> 58:22.353
I know how much you love me!

58:23.523 --> 58:26.027
I know it!
I know how much you love me.

58:27.194 --> 58:28.360
So much.

58:35.302 --> 58:37.902
Oh! Beautiful.

58:37.904 --> 58:41.174
You are the ornament that makes
this Christmas complete.

58:45.578 --> 58:48.148
Ow! Concrete. Hurting.

58:49.917 --> 58:50.985
You're weird.

58:53.052 --> 58:55.022
Oh, honey.
Let me help you up. Come here.

58:55.355 --> 58:56.554
Oh, baby.

58:56.556 --> 58:59.023
It takes more than that
to keep me down.

58:59.025 --> 59:00.994
Okay guys,
Dad's gonna open the cave.

59:01.895 --> 59:03.895
The time has come!

59:03.897 --> 59:06.431
I now pronounce
the Christmas cave

59:06.433 --> 59:09.034
officially open!

59:28.922 --> 59:31.657
I know. Pretty awesome, right?

59:31.659 --> 59:35.797
Now, you need get to your post
at the end of the tour.

59:38.197 --> 59:39.596
Well, come on!

59:39.598 --> 59:41.699
All right, all right.
One at a time, one at a time.

59:41.701 --> 59:44.201
Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas!

59:44.203 --> 59:45.302
Right after you.
Make your way.

59:45.304 --> 59:48.373
Take your time.
Enjoy all the sights.

59:48.375 --> 59:51.242
Good, good, good.
No pushing, now. No pushing.

59:51.244 --> 59:53.277
We've got plenty of room
in the cave.

59:53.279 --> 59:55.346
Come around a second lap,
if you want.

59:55.348 --> 59:58.317
It's Christmas time
for crying out loud.

59:58.319 --> 01:00:00.485
So, then I had to learn to...

01:00:00.487 --> 01:00:01.786
to walk again.

01:00:01.788 --> 01:00:03.253
And just as I was able to stand,

01:00:03.255 --> 01:00:06.724
I fell in love with Chris here,
and he swept me off my feet.

01:00:07.927 --> 01:00:11.096
But then he had to go
fight in the war.

01:00:11.098 --> 01:00:12.297
That's so inspiring,
Mr. Winters.

01:00:12.299 --> 01:00:14.201
- Yeah.
- Which war did you fight in?

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:19.040
Canada, in Canadian War.

01:00:21.241 --> 01:00:23.507
Hmm. People don't really
talk about it much.

01:00:23.509 --> 01:00:25.011
- Eh?
- No, they don't.

01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:27.880
They don't.

01:00:27.882 --> 01:00:29.350
They don't, they don't talk.

01:00:36.255 --> 01:00:37.290
It's cool!

01:00:43.998 --> 01:00:45.230
Okay...

01:01:00.748 --> 01:01:02.081
So, it was
the Battle of Winnipeg, right?

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:04.449
And it was brutal,
because it was covered in snow

01:01:04.451 --> 01:01:06.351
- and maple syrup...
- Whoa.

01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:09.121
Is Nicky all right in there?
It's been a while.

01:01:09.123 --> 01:01:10.422
Oh, no, no, no.

01:01:10.424 --> 01:01:11.523
She was probably just...

01:01:11.525 --> 01:01:12.724
- Oh.
- ...wrangling

01:01:12.726 --> 01:01:14.393
- an extra-large matzoh ball.
- Okay. Heh, heh.

01:01:14.395 --> 01:01:16.194
Too proud to ask for help.

01:01:16.196 --> 01:01:18.262
You stay there, I'll go check.

01:01:18.264 --> 01:01:20.400
And don't let them leave, okay?

01:01:24.438 --> 01:01:26.304
<i>♪ Oh, Canada ♪</i>

01:01:26.306 --> 01:01:27.308
No!

01:01:29.543 --> 01:01:30.741
Yay!

01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:32.076
Stephanie!

01:01:32.078 --> 01:01:34.179
- There are no words.
- The words are help!

01:01:34.181 --> 01:01:35.579
Stephanie!

01:01:35.581 --> 01:01:36.748
Someone's coming!
With you in a second.

01:01:37.817 --> 01:01:39.483
Stephanie?

01:01:39.485 --> 01:01:40.819
Hey, do you have ice tongs?

01:01:40.821 --> 01:01:42.487
I feel like my character
would have ice tongs.

01:01:42.489 --> 01:01:43.491
No!

01:01:50.264 --> 01:01:51.966
It's fine.

01:01:56.804 --> 01:01:59.603
Stephanie! Stephanie?
Stephanie!

01:01:59.605 --> 01:02:01.338
Come in this window.
It's bigger.

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.076
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:02:03.509 --> 01:02:05.076
Okay.

01:02:09.616 --> 01:02:11.215
You guys okay in there?

01:02:11.217 --> 01:02:12.416
Ow.

01:02:12.418 --> 01:02:13.884
Nicky, someone's coming.

01:02:13.886 --> 01:02:15.454
- Who? Hey, why...
- Someone's coming.

01:02:15.456 --> 01:02:16.554
Someone's coming!

01:02:16.556 --> 01:02:18.623
Should I even ask?

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:21.226
How is everything going
with Mr. and Mrs. Fake Parent?

01:02:21.228 --> 01:02:22.694
Yeah, it's fine.
Everything's fine.

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:24.161
- No, no, no, no!
- It's just eggnog!

01:02:24.163 --> 01:02:25.329
Okay.

01:02:25.331 --> 01:02:27.232
It's just eggnog!

01:02:27.234 --> 01:02:29.400
I can hear
your ankle monitor beeping!

01:02:29.402 --> 01:02:30.569
It could be better.

01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:31.936
That's it.

01:02:31.938 --> 01:02:33.304
- I can't act with this woman.
- You can't act, period.

01:02:33.306 --> 01:02:34.373
- Oh, I can't act? You're the...
- Oh, oh, I'm this guy...

01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:37.108
Guys.

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:38.112
Guys.

01:02:40.346 --> 01:02:42.015
That boy in there loves me.

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:44.416
Please, do not ruin this.

01:02:44.418 --> 01:02:46.520
He said I'm his Kate Middleton.

01:02:47.888 --> 01:02:49.422
He said I'm his Kate!

01:02:51.558 --> 01:02:52.560
Okay.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.525
Fine.

01:02:54.527 --> 01:02:56.527
Thank you.

01:02:56.529 --> 01:02:58.362
- Who's Kate Middleton?
- She's the princess!

01:02:58.364 --> 01:02:59.366
Oh, my god.

01:03:02.869 --> 01:03:04.636
Hm.

01:03:07.306 --> 01:03:08.672
Who is ready for soup?

01:03:08.674 --> 01:03:10.410
Ah, um.

01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:13.411
Hm.

01:03:13.413 --> 01:03:15.413
Watch and see how it's done.

01:03:15.415 --> 01:03:17.148
I was just gonna ask Tanner
to tell us the story

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:18.418
about how you guys met at camp.

01:03:19.319 --> 01:03:20.521
You forgot to nod.

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:25.422
Once I heard Nicky on that tuba,

01:03:25.424 --> 01:03:27.127
the rest is pretty much history.

01:03:40.174 --> 01:03:42.373
Is that a bat?

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:44.308
Is it wearing reindeer antlers?

01:03:44.310 --> 01:03:46.378
- Oh!
- Hey!

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.179
Hey, guess what.

01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:49.581
Let's play
a fun party game called,

01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:50.982
"No one look out the window."

01:03:50.984 --> 01:03:53.418
Oh, I'm going outside
to get a picture of that bat.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.954
Oh, no. You don't wanna do that.

01:03:55.956 --> 01:03:58.190
Why not?

01:03:58.192 --> 01:04:00.592
Here's that thing, the family
that lives next door is nuts.

01:04:00.594 --> 01:04:01.960
- Bonkers.
- Every year,

01:04:01.962 --> 01:04:04.628
that sad family puts on
some insane Christmas display

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:05.963
that is totally over the top.

01:04:05.965 --> 01:04:08.333
Oh, criminally.
Like, over the top.

01:04:08.335 --> 01:04:10.534
And the kicker is,
the city actually passed a law

01:04:10.536 --> 01:04:12.603
to try and stop them
from making more disturbing

01:04:12.605 --> 01:04:14.072
and dangerous lighting displays.

01:04:14.074 --> 01:04:16.340
- Oh, my god, they did! Yeah!
- So, they built a huge cave,

01:04:16.342 --> 01:04:18.375
and they put the display
inside of that.

01:04:18.377 --> 01:04:20.344
- Inside the cave!
- And what's a Christmas cave

01:04:20.346 --> 01:04:21.746
without Christmas bats?
Am I right?

01:04:21.748 --> 01:04:23.415
That's what you saw.

01:04:23.417 --> 01:04:25.319
Mm-hmm. That's what you saw.

01:04:26.587 --> 01:04:28.219
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:28.221 --> 01:04:29.622
Isn't that so, "Huh?"
It's crazy.

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:32.523
That seems rather extreme.

01:04:32.525 --> 01:04:35.594
Extreme doesn't begin
to describe it.

01:04:35.596 --> 01:04:38.563
They also make their children
dress up as ornaments.

01:04:38.565 --> 01:04:39.663
Ornaments!

01:04:39.665 --> 01:04:41.733
And that's just child abuse.

01:04:41.735 --> 01:04:43.367
Mm-hmm.

01:04:43.369 --> 01:04:44.603
Uh, if these people
are so horrible.

01:04:44.605 --> 01:04:47.005
- No joke, trust me, they are.
- Huh, yeah.

01:04:47.007 --> 01:04:48.375
Why don't you guys just move?

01:04:49.375 --> 01:04:50.377
Oh.

01:04:51.612 --> 01:04:52.811
Uh...

01:04:52.813 --> 01:04:56.648
- We feel sorry for them.
- We feel sorry for them.

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:58.315
- Sorry for them.
- Right, Mom and Dad?

01:04:58.317 --> 01:04:59.352
Mm-hmm.

01:05:00.353 --> 01:05:01.753
We pray for them nightly.

01:05:01.755 --> 01:05:03.587
And drink to their salvation.

01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:04.655
Amen.

01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:10.462
Um...

01:05:10.464 --> 01:05:12.029
Please excuse me for a moment.

01:05:18.471 --> 01:05:20.005
Is, is your dad okay?

01:05:20.007 --> 01:05:21.239
Uh, he'll be fine.

01:05:21.241 --> 01:05:23.708
Just, uh, tough for him
to talk about anything

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:26.344
Christmas related is all,
you know?

01:05:26.346 --> 01:05:27.411
- I understand.
- Yeah,

01:05:27.413 --> 01:05:29.047
it was a tough time
for both of us.

01:05:29.049 --> 01:05:31.284
I wish he could move on
for his own sake.

01:05:34.587 --> 01:05:36.820
All right, everyone.
Calm down, calm down.

01:05:36.822 --> 01:05:38.558
The gates are
gonna be opening soon!

01:05:40.761 --> 01:05:42.429
We've been waiting for hours.

01:05:43.663 --> 01:05:46.030
Stephanie, will you help me
in the kitchen

01:05:46.032 --> 01:05:48.500
with something
with which I need help with?

01:05:48.502 --> 01:05:50.302
Oh, certainly, Nicky.

01:05:54.574 --> 01:05:57.074
Let me tell you about the time
I carried a Sherpa on my back

01:05:57.076 --> 01:05:58.043
at 30,000 feet.

01:05:58.045 --> 01:05:59.444
- Okay.
- You're, you're nodding.

01:05:59.446 --> 01:06:01.579
I... No, I am, I am.
'Cause I'm... I'm good at it.

01:06:01.581 --> 01:06:03.551
I got... I got paid to do it.

01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:07.518
<i>Law & Order.</i>

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.688
<i>George Bailey
to Clarence, what's the hold up?</i>

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.822
<i>Something must be wrong
with the dancing Santa.</i>

01:06:11.824 --> 01:06:14.058
<i>I told you
Nicky can't be trusted.</i>

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.259
- I gotta go back!
- Okay.

01:06:15.261 --> 01:06:16.360
- Come on!
- Come on, come on.

01:06:16.362 --> 01:06:17.094
It really does take two people

01:06:17.096 --> 01:06:19.797
to put this costume on.

01:06:19.799 --> 01:06:21.065
You'd think whoever designed
this thing would have realized

01:06:21.067 --> 01:06:22.800
anybody who bought it
would have no friends.

01:06:22.802 --> 01:06:25.704
- Yeah. Pull down.
- Come on. Okay.

01:06:25.706 --> 01:06:27.338
- One, two, three.
- Okay.

01:06:29.743 --> 01:06:31.342
- Good to go. Got it.
- Good?

01:06:31.344 --> 01:06:32.612
Go, team.

01:06:37.583 --> 01:06:38.752
Sorry, folks.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:48.360
Oh, my... No.

01:06:48.362 --> 01:06:51.128
Not Satan. Santa!

01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:52.230
That one scared me, and you?

01:06:52.232 --> 01:06:54.766
Excuse us.

01:06:54.768 --> 01:06:56.436
Sorry. One sec.

01:06:57.436 --> 01:06:58.503
Nicky!

01:06:58.505 --> 01:06:59.737
What is going on?

01:06:59.739 --> 01:07:01.505
We're backed up all the way
to the elves!

01:07:01.507 --> 01:07:03.875
Just, uh, working out
a leg cramp.

01:07:03.877 --> 01:07:05.076
Oh.

01:07:05.078 --> 01:07:06.478
Okay.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.679
Hey, everyone.

01:07:07.681 --> 01:07:09.581
Sorry about the delay.

01:07:09.583 --> 01:07:11.882
But, I now present,

01:07:11.884 --> 01:07:14.619
the dancing Santa!

01:07:17.824 --> 01:07:20.125
This is the best Christmas
ever, Dad!

01:07:20.127 --> 01:07:21.494
Oh, honey.

01:07:28.701 --> 01:07:31.603
Ha! Oh, my god.

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:43.947
And we have now come
to the main event!

01:07:43.949 --> 01:07:45.483
Ah, yeah!

01:07:45.485 --> 01:07:46.918
I know what you're thinking.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.422
It can't be. But it is.

01:07:50.424 --> 01:07:53.491
I give you,
the Santa hat

01:07:53.493 --> 01:07:56.927
from the single greatest
Christmas movie ever made!

01:07:56.929 --> 01:07:58.762
<i>Die Hard?</i>

01:07:58.764 --> 01:08:00.764
- No.
- <i>Elf?</i>

01:08:00.766 --> 01:08:02.766
- No.
- <i>Christmas with the Cranks?</i>

01:08:02.768 --> 01:08:03.701
What? No.

01:08:03.703 --> 01:08:06.137
- <i>Polar Express.</i>
- Uh, no.

01:08:06.139 --> 01:08:07.438
<i>A Christmas Story.</i>

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.540
Ooh! Wrong!

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:09.875
- <i>Bad Santa.</i>
- What? No!

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.909
- <i>Scrooge?</i>
- Oh, it's not even close.

01:08:11.911 --> 01:08:13.445
<i>Christmas Vacation?</i>

01:08:13.447 --> 01:08:14.545
No.

01:08:14.547 --> 01:08:16.479
- <i>Gremlins!</i>
- Seriously? No!

01:08:16.482 --> 01:08:17.814
<i>Ernest Saves Christmas.</i>

01:08:17.817 --> 01:08:19.117
No!

01:08:19.118 --> 01:08:21.752
I'm almost ready to ask you
to leave the tour.

01:08:21.754 --> 01:08:23.720
<i>Santa Claus Versus The Martians.</i>

01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:24.988
Nobody saw that!

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:26.858
<i>Nobody saw that!</i>

01:08:26.859 --> 01:08:28.493
I saw it.

01:08:28.495 --> 01:08:31.528
<i>Miracle on 34th Street!</i>

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:32.595
- Aha?
- Great movie!

01:08:32.598 --> 01:08:33.801
First released in...

01:08:34.935 --> 01:08:36.568
Oh, seriously?

01:08:36.569 --> 01:08:40.537
Ugh. Oh. Ah! Dang kids!

01:08:40.538 --> 01:08:43.774
Who'd put chewing gum
on my Christmas hat display.

01:08:43.776 --> 01:08:45.943
Dad, I need to go rest.

01:08:45.944 --> 01:08:47.877
I'm cold and I'm tired.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.645
Oh, you deserve a rest, honey.

01:08:49.648 --> 01:08:53.751
You did a great job.
Noelle loved it, didn't you?

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:55.755
I gotta go get this gum
off my display.

01:08:57.223 --> 01:08:58.421
Actually.

01:08:58.424 --> 01:09:01.259
Why don't you wear the hat,
in the meantime.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:02.158
Hmm?

01:09:02.161 --> 01:09:03.926
Hm.

01:09:03.929 --> 01:09:05.765
Oh!

01:09:06.932 --> 01:09:08.399
Will you look at that.

01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:11.769
The two most precious things
to me, in the entire world.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.671
That Santa hat
and my beautiful daughter.

01:09:14.673 --> 01:09:16.707
- Daddy...
- Not now, Noelle.

01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:17.742
Okay, where was I?

01:09:17.743 --> 01:09:19.609
Oh, yes.
Two most precious things.

01:09:19.612 --> 01:09:20.979
Hm.

01:09:20.981 --> 01:09:23.515
Okay. Continuing on
with our tour now, everybody.

01:09:23.517 --> 01:09:24.750
We're coming up to our

01:09:24.752 --> 01:09:27.783
build-your-own-snowman
portion of the cave.

01:09:27.786 --> 01:09:30.787
And here's something I made
in my workshop.

01:09:30.788 --> 01:09:32.924
It's a bat with antlers.

01:09:32.926 --> 01:09:34.626
A reindeer bat.

01:09:47.973 --> 01:09:49.607
Don't let me fall.

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:50.808
Don't let me fall.
Don't let me...

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:52.542
I know!

01:09:52.545 --> 01:09:53.609
You let me fall.

01:09:53.612 --> 01:09:55.712
I hate Christmas

01:09:55.714 --> 01:09:56.881
- so much.
- Is this the hat...

01:09:56.883 --> 01:09:58.114
That hat
from the stupid, old movie

01:09:58.116 --> 01:10:00.685
my dad spent
my college education money on?

01:10:00.687 --> 01:10:01.952
Yeah, it is.

01:10:01.954 --> 01:10:03.153
Well, you got back
just in time.

01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:05.023
Because I think
Tanner and his dad are starting

01:10:05.025 --> 01:10:06.724
to get suspicious.

01:10:06.726 --> 01:10:08.626
I know.

01:10:08.628 --> 01:10:10.862
It's a miracle
they haven't figured it out yet.

01:10:10.864 --> 01:10:13.598
If I ever hire actors
to play my parents,

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.765
it will not be those two.

01:10:16.069 --> 01:10:18.769
But, if I had a boyfriend
as awesome as yours,

01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:20.270
I too would hire a fake family

01:10:20.272 --> 01:10:21.672
to have Christmas dinner
with them.

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:23.975
Sure, you can see the kitchen.

01:10:23.977 --> 01:10:26.043
- Oh!
- Go ahead, go, go, go.

01:10:27.914 --> 01:10:29.450
Okay.

01:10:31.718 --> 01:10:33.487
- Go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:40.727 --> 01:10:41.826
Everything all right in here?

01:10:41.828 --> 01:10:43.961
- Yeah, I was starting to worry.
- Yeah.

01:10:43.963 --> 01:10:45.665
Yeah, everything's fine.
We were just...

01:10:46.865 --> 01:10:47.998
Just doing the dishes.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.899
Doing the dishes.

01:10:48.901 --> 01:10:50.635
Doing the dishes.

01:10:50.637 --> 01:10:51.970
Okay, all done.

01:10:51.972 --> 01:10:53.104
Come on, shall we?

01:10:53.106 --> 01:10:55.607
Come on, let's go.

01:10:55.609 --> 01:10:57.041
Latke.

01:10:57.043 --> 01:10:58.943
That was close.

01:10:58.945 --> 01:11:01.112
Clarence to George Bailey.

01:11:01.114 --> 01:11:02.913
Clarence to George Bailey.

01:11:02.915 --> 01:11:04.851
It's not such
a wonderful life, after all.

01:11:05.951 --> 01:11:07.118
Oh, boy.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.885
And that's how
you make a chicken napkin.

01:11:08.887 --> 01:11:10.654
Chicken napkin!

01:11:11.857 --> 01:11:14.058
Stupidest thing I've ever seen.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.960
Oh! I just realized.
I haven't done my impression

01:11:15.962 --> 01:11:16.964
of Abraham Lincoln.

01:11:17.998 --> 01:11:19.663
No one knows

01:11:19.665 --> 01:11:20.832
what he sounds like, honey.

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:22.899
And is therefore,
immune to criticism.

01:11:25.871 --> 01:11:28.072
"Four score
and seven years ago."

01:11:28.074 --> 01:11:30.041
Um, sorry.
Lincoln's from the south.

01:11:30.043 --> 01:11:31.044
Immune to criticism!

01:11:33.146 --> 01:11:36.180
Well, as they say in Cali,
it's time for Latkes!

01:11:37.383 --> 01:11:38.649
Nicky?

01:11:39.686 --> 01:11:40.752
What's going on?

01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:42.923
Mrs. Franklin?
What are you doing back?

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:45.922
Bed bugs at the hotel.

01:11:45.924 --> 01:11:49.060
Who are these people?
Why are they in my house?

01:11:49.062 --> 01:11:50.927
Your house?

01:11:50.929 --> 01:11:52.130
She's in here.

01:11:52.132 --> 01:11:54.666
See, Dad. This is ugly.

01:11:54.668 --> 01:11:56.167
The only upside
of this situation is that

01:11:56.169 --> 01:11:58.168
I'm going to be getting
the bigger room.

01:11:58.170 --> 01:12:00.807
Since, Nicky's going away
for a long, long time.

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:05.208
- Go home, Rudy.
- But...

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:06.547
I wanna...

01:12:11.851 --> 01:12:13.818
What's going on?

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:16.089
Yeah, Nicky.
What exactly is going on?

01:12:18.223 --> 01:12:20.123
You guys live here?

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:22.025
No! Just me.

01:12:22.027 --> 01:12:24.394
Nicky's dad lives next door.

01:12:24.396 --> 01:12:25.829
Nicky's dad?

01:12:25.831 --> 01:12:26.900
Yes?

01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:31.101
Then who are you?

01:12:31.103 --> 01:12:33.837
I'm Chris, I'm Nicky's dad.

01:12:33.839 --> 01:12:35.073
I'm Chris.

01:12:35.075 --> 01:12:36.207
I'm Nicky's dad.

01:12:36.209 --> 01:12:37.975
No!

01:12:37.977 --> 01:12:39.746
I'm Nicky's dad!

01:12:40.213 --> 01:12:41.845
Damn, understudy.

01:12:41.847 --> 01:12:43.980
Understudy?
No, no, no. Not again!

01:12:43.982 --> 01:12:46.152
Aw, I thought you'd be
used to it by now.

01:12:47.853 --> 01:12:49.923
No, this can't be happening.
I will not be replaced!

01:12:51.191 --> 01:12:52.489
I've been listening
through the vents.

01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:55.993
And I believe your acting,
is missing the mark.

01:12:55.995 --> 01:12:58.762
Oh, yeah?

01:12:58.764 --> 01:13:00.497
Missing the mark, huh!

01:13:02.736 --> 01:13:04.167
Yeah.

01:13:04.169 --> 01:13:05.869
Understudies!

01:13:05.871 --> 01:13:07.137
Stop! Stop, right now!

01:13:08.807 --> 01:13:09.873
Cut!

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:13.243
Please note.

01:13:13.245 --> 01:13:15.715
That I did all my own stunts.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.520
You're all done here.

01:13:24.391 --> 01:13:26.056
And scene!

01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:27.524
- Please.
- I feel good. You know.

01:13:27.526 --> 01:13:28.826
Normally,
I am my harshest critic.

01:13:28.828 --> 01:13:30.260
But I feel like tonight
was some of my best work.

01:13:30.262 --> 01:13:33.029
And now, if you'll allow me
to give you a few pointers

01:13:33.031 --> 01:13:34.064
on your "performance."

01:13:34.066 --> 01:13:35.532
- Okay...
- I would start with the...

01:13:36.468 --> 01:13:38.269
- You're gonna be singing
- No!

01:13:38.271 --> 01:13:39.170
- in Rikers!
- No!

01:13:39.172 --> 01:13:40.237
- No!
- Yes!

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:41.471
- No!
- Yes!

01:13:41.473 --> 01:13:43.940
Can we talk
about this over a drink?

01:13:43.942 --> 01:13:45.176
Where is my Parsley?

01:13:45.178 --> 01:13:47.310
Oh, he's in here.

01:13:48.882 --> 01:13:49.913
I...

01:13:49.915 --> 01:13:50.950
Nicky, what's going on?

01:13:51.918 --> 01:13:53.551
Please, I...

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.322
Tanner, I swear I can explain.

01:13:58.324 --> 01:14:01.024
Yes.
We'd all like to hear that.

01:14:01.026 --> 01:14:02.061
Is it true?

01:14:02.896 --> 01:14:04.128
Huh, what Rudy says?

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:08.064
That you're so ashamed of us,
you hired actors

01:14:08.066 --> 01:14:09.833
so that your boyfriend
and his father

01:14:09.835 --> 01:14:11.002
wouldn't have to meet
your real family?

01:14:11.004 --> 01:14:12.403
Christmas has caused
Tanner and his Dad

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:14.939
nothing but heartache.
And I couldn't let them suffer

01:14:14.941 --> 01:14:16.239
through your insane version

01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:17.809
- of this holiday!
- Oh, Nicky.

01:14:17.811 --> 01:14:19.210
You are in big trouble.

01:14:19.212 --> 01:14:21.011
All this fighting.

01:14:21.013 --> 01:14:22.145
I hate Christmas.

01:14:22.147 --> 01:14:24.247
Oh. Hate?

01:14:24.249 --> 01:14:27.818
Oh! Oh, is this the boy
who turned you against me?

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.019
I didn't ask her to do anything.

01:14:29.021 --> 01:14:31.956
Oh, right,
she just magically transformed

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:34.859
into a liar who happens to hate
Christmas, just like you.

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:36.193
That's enough!

01:14:36.195 --> 01:14:37.894
We don't have to stand here
and listen to this.

01:14:37.896 --> 01:14:39.229
We're leaving. <i>Vamos.</i>

01:14:39.231 --> 01:14:40.232
Dad.

01:14:40.999 --> 01:14:42.002
Now.

01:14:43.969 --> 01:14:45.036
Why does Christmas

01:14:45.038 --> 01:14:47.107
always have to ruin
everything good.

01:14:58.618 --> 01:14:59.684
Tanner, Tanner!

01:14:59.686 --> 01:15:01.618
No, no, no, sweetheart.
Just let him go.

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.119
I really, really like him.

01:15:03.121 --> 01:15:05.389
They're not even
Christmas people!

01:15:05.391 --> 01:15:06.858
You're right.

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:07.958
They're normal.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.094
I've never had
a normal Christmas!

01:15:10.096 --> 01:15:11.628
Do you have any idea
how good it felt

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:14.265
to sit down with my fake dad
and my fake family

01:15:14.267 --> 01:15:15.565
on Christmas Eve?

01:15:15.567 --> 01:15:17.969
A feeling of peace came over me,

01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:20.304
like, I have never known
in my entire life.

01:15:20.306 --> 01:15:23.875
Okay. You don't even know
what you're saying right now.

01:15:28.047 --> 01:15:30.282
That cat really
should have been called Pissy.

01:15:32.951 --> 01:15:34.652
It's my magic hat!

01:15:35.888 --> 01:15:36.956
Ugh.

01:15:44.129 --> 01:15:45.164
Ruined.

01:16:04.182 --> 01:16:05.284
Tanner!

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.822
Tanner, wait.

01:16:10.088 --> 01:16:11.354
Tanner, wait!

01:16:11.356 --> 01:16:12.792
Wait, please.

01:17:20.692 --> 01:17:23.096
Die, you stupid Christmas tree!

01:17:30.035 --> 01:17:31.270
Nicky's gone crazy!

01:17:32.504 --> 01:17:34.372
This is the best Christmas ever.

01:17:34.374 --> 01:17:35.439
Mom, can I have her room

01:17:35.441 --> 01:17:38.042
once you put her
in the insane hospital?

01:17:38.945 --> 01:17:40.110
Oh.

01:17:40.112 --> 01:17:43.046
Mommy, why is Nicky
killing Christmas?

01:17:43.048 --> 01:17:46.117
Honey, it's just something
teenage girls do.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.153
Nicky, you stop this behavior,
right now!

01:17:50.155 --> 01:17:52.288
No, Dad. I need to do this.

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:54.391
'Cause Christmas ruins
everything.

01:17:54.393 --> 01:17:58.162
I hate this stupid decoration.

01:17:58.164 --> 01:18:00.564
And stupid Santa Claus.

01:18:00.566 --> 01:18:04.100
And all the stupid songs.

01:18:04.102 --> 01:18:06.470
And the stupid trees
every damned year!

01:18:06.472 --> 01:18:08.305
Why do you do this
to us, Dad?

01:18:08.307 --> 01:18:11.375
Why do you shove Christmas down
everyone's throats?

01:18:11.377 --> 01:18:13.176
Why can't you be a normal dad?

01:18:13.178 --> 01:18:14.377
If you were a normal dad,

01:18:14.379 --> 01:18:15.813
I never would have had
to lie to Tanner,

01:18:15.815 --> 01:18:17.047
and gone through all this.

01:18:17.049 --> 01:18:18.282
And Tanner never
would have found out about it

01:18:18.284 --> 01:18:20.317
and gotten mad at me.
But, because of you,

01:18:20.319 --> 01:18:23.119
Tanner will never talk me again.

01:18:23.121 --> 01:18:25.055
Why are you such
a Christmas freak?

01:18:25.057 --> 01:18:26.457
Because that's
what you are, Dad.

01:18:26.459 --> 01:18:27.494
A freak.

01:18:30.797 --> 01:18:33.596
Oh, my god.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.282

Honey?

01:20:49.602 --> 01:20:51.471
Why don't you come downstairs
and open presents?

01:20:52.737 --> 01:20:54.037
Seriously?

01:20:54.039 --> 01:20:56.207
Despite what's going on
between you and your dad,

01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:57.341
we're a family.

01:20:57.343 --> 01:20:58.708
And it's Christmas Eve,

01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:00.480
and that's when
we open presents.

01:21:01.246 --> 01:21:02.248
Okay?

01:21:04.282 --> 01:21:05.351
All right. Come on.

01:21:33.346 --> 01:21:35.248
Why is everyone so sad?

01:21:38.383 --> 01:21:39.617
Oh, no.

01:21:39.619 --> 01:21:41.784
Oh. Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

01:21:41.786 --> 01:21:43.188
My chest.

01:21:46.292 --> 01:21:48.492
- Fran Sienna Winters?
- Yes, yes.

01:21:48.494 --> 01:21:50.327
I have the good news
to tell you,

01:21:50.329 --> 01:21:51.662
she did not have a heart attack.

01:21:51.664 --> 01:21:52.796
Oh!

01:21:52.798 --> 01:21:54.297
What was it then?

01:21:54.299 --> 01:21:55.765
Well, according
to the test we made,

01:21:55.767 --> 01:21:59.336
your mother
is as healthy as a...

01:21:59.338 --> 01:22:02.275
You know, you're not a horse,
you're not a donkey, it's...

01:22:03.342 --> 01:22:04.742
- You're a mule?
- Yes.

01:22:04.744 --> 01:22:06.277
Your mother is mule.

01:22:06.279 --> 01:22:07.312
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

01:22:09.981 --> 01:22:11.649
So mom's gonna be okay?
That's wonderful.

01:22:11.651 --> 01:22:14.417
So, what exactly
did happen to her?

01:22:14.419 --> 01:22:16.586
We see this sometimes
during the holidays,

01:22:16.588 --> 01:22:18.055
cause is stress.

01:22:18.057 --> 01:22:21.558
Is there something stressful
happening in the family now?

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.562
Something that would upset her?

01:22:26.031 --> 01:22:29.535
Any what, she said she wants
to speak to someone named Nicky.

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:47.186
Grandma?

01:22:49.054 --> 01:22:50.589
Are you alone?

01:22:51.456 --> 01:22:53.056
- Yup.
- Oh.

01:22:53.058 --> 01:22:54.292
Good.

01:22:54.294 --> 01:22:57.528
I didn't know how much longer
I could fake it.

01:22:57.530 --> 01:23:00.564
Grandma, you were pretending?

01:23:00.566 --> 01:23:02.599
I can't breathe.

01:23:02.601 --> 01:23:04.068
Oh, help me.

01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:05.536
Help me.

01:23:07.539 --> 01:23:09.340
I should've been
an actress, huh?

01:23:09.342 --> 01:23:10.407
Hmm.

01:23:10.409 --> 01:23:12.743
Screw you, Faye Dunaway.

01:23:12.745 --> 01:23:14.478
Who's Faye Dunaway?

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.346
Exactly.

01:23:16.348 --> 01:23:18.549
Why would you pretend
to have a heart attack?

01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:21.452
The tension between you
and your dad

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:24.555
was sticker than molasses
on neck hair.

01:23:24.557 --> 01:23:26.055
We were all worried about you.

01:23:26.057 --> 01:23:28.227
Oh, let me have some fun.

01:23:28.861 --> 01:23:30.627
Plus,

01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:33.363
I wanted to give you some time

01:23:33.365 --> 01:23:36.500
to make things right
between you and your dad.

01:23:36.502 --> 01:23:40.570
Fine,
I'll just apologize to him.

01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:41.807
Will you mean it?

01:23:42.674 --> 01:23:43.676
No.

01:23:50.415 --> 01:23:51.482
Ow!

01:23:51.484 --> 01:23:53.716
- Ow!
- You...

01:23:53.718 --> 01:23:55.918
- idiot.
- You're strong for an old woman.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.422
He's gonna know if you fake it.

01:23:59.424 --> 01:24:02.626
Clark Gable knew
when I made love to him.

01:24:02.628 --> 01:24:04.927
And let me tell you,
he did give a damn.

01:24:06.865 --> 01:24:08.599
Grandma, please.

01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:09.768
Oh, sweetie.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.643
If you don't make things right
between you and your dad,

01:24:19.645 --> 01:24:22.512
things will never be
the same again.

01:24:30.588 --> 01:24:32.488
She's okay?
She's talking?

01:24:32.490 --> 01:24:34.757
You know Grandma,
she says what she says.

01:24:36.128 --> 01:24:37.927
She's feeling good though.

01:24:37.929 --> 01:24:39.162
You can all go in now.

01:24:39.164 --> 01:24:41.899
Okay. Come on kids,
let's go see Grandma.

01:24:41.901 --> 01:24:43.367
Wait. Nicky, honey,

01:24:43.369 --> 01:24:45.638
just, um, sit down for a second,
I wanna show you something.

01:24:46.638 --> 01:24:47.706
Okay.

01:24:54.446 --> 01:24:55.878
Oh, my god.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.448
Yeah, not a pretty picture,
is it?

01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:01.486
What happened to his face,
the poor kid.

01:25:02.554 --> 01:25:03.655
That's your father.

01:25:06.491 --> 01:25:08.591
When he was
five years old.

01:25:08.593 --> 01:25:10.226
Some neighborhood bullies
threw him in a patch

01:25:10.228 --> 01:25:13.197
of poison ivy
and rubbed his face in it.

01:25:13.199 --> 01:25:14.933
As you can see
it swelled up pretty bad.

01:25:16.735 --> 01:25:17.870
That's awful.

01:25:18.904 --> 01:25:20.503
It was a few weeks
before Christmas

01:25:20.505 --> 01:25:21.637
and even though
he looked like that

01:25:21.639 --> 01:25:24.006
he still really wanted
to see Santa.

01:25:24.008 --> 01:25:26.643
When your grandparents
took him to the mall

01:25:26.645 --> 01:25:28.845
all the kids in line
were pointing at his face

01:25:28.847 --> 01:25:30.747
and making fun of him,

01:25:30.749 --> 01:25:31.851
and he started crying.

01:25:32.852 --> 01:25:34.818
And then as they turned to go,

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.790
that mall Santa picked him up,
sat him down on his lap,

01:25:39.725 --> 01:25:40.793
and your dad...

01:25:41.694 --> 01:25:42.859
stopped crying,

01:25:42.861 --> 01:25:44.894
and told that wonderful Santa

01:25:44.896 --> 01:25:46.832
everything he wanted
for Christmas.

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.867
See, that Santa

01:25:49.869 --> 01:25:51.534
took a kid who believed
in Christmas

01:25:51.536 --> 01:25:53.237
and made him feel like
a little boy again,

01:25:53.239 --> 01:25:54.574
instead of a freak.

01:25:56.775 --> 01:25:57.777
Mom, I...

01:25:59.645 --> 01:26:01.644
I had no idea.

01:26:01.646 --> 01:26:03.980
He just wants you guys to feel

01:26:03.982 --> 01:26:05.849
loved and magical,

01:26:05.851 --> 01:26:07.887
like he did that day
when he was five.

01:26:10.255 --> 01:26:11.988
So now you know.

01:26:41.053 --> 01:26:43.856

she's gonna be fine.

Thanks for doing all this.

01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:32.328
I'm here for you, girl.

01:28:32.330 --> 01:28:34.898
Right by your side.
Sticking to you like glue.

01:28:36.067 --> 01:28:37.069
Wow!

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:38.938
Cute elf.

01:28:40.039 --> 01:28:41.805
Um...

01:28:41.807 --> 01:28:44.207
My little brother's getting
his tonsils out.

01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:45.912
You wanna hang with me
in the waiting room?

01:28:47.745 --> 01:28:49.080
Laters.

01:28:51.717 --> 01:28:54.016
Now that's a Christmas miracle
I can get behind.

01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:58.788
There's a party
in Room 220.

01:28:59.924 --> 01:29:01.824
Merry Christmas,
everybody!

01:29:01.826 --> 01:29:02.928
Nicky!

01:29:04.228 --> 01:29:05.697
Did you arrange that?

01:29:08.834 --> 01:29:10.100
Thank you.

01:29:10.102 --> 01:29:12.171
I wanted everyone
to have a great Christmas.

01:29:13.705 --> 01:29:15.104
Yeah.

01:29:15.106 --> 01:29:18.140
Uh, the... the carolers
were a nice touch.

01:29:20.913 --> 01:29:22.045
Nicky...

01:29:22.047 --> 01:29:23.883
Okay, look, honey.

01:29:27.252 --> 01:29:30.252
A father often forgets

01:29:30.254 --> 01:29:34.157
that his little girl
will eventually grow up,

01:29:34.159 --> 01:29:37.696
and become their own person.

01:29:38.864 --> 01:29:41.601
I mean, look at you.
You... you have.

01:29:42.234 --> 01:29:45.034
And... and I'm sorry,

01:29:45.036 --> 01:29:48.641
I didn't recognize that before
but I... I do now.

01:29:50.008 --> 01:29:52.978
And I would love it
if you would join us.

01:29:54.512 --> 01:29:56.848
On one condition.

01:29:58.816 --> 01:30:01.152
It's something
you actually want to do.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.029
Oh.

01:30:19.338 --> 01:30:23.006
Sorry I hired an actor
to pretend to be you.

01:30:23.008 --> 01:30:25.775
I'm sorry I yelled
at your boyfriend.

01:30:25.777 --> 01:30:27.713
I'm sorry I called you a freak.

01:30:30.081 --> 01:30:31.782
Well, I kinda am.

01:30:31.784 --> 01:30:33.183
But I get it.

01:30:35.254 --> 01:30:37.790
And I'm sorry
I smothered you with Christmas.

01:30:39.792 --> 01:30:42.125
Thanks, Dad. I...
I appreciate you saying that.

01:30:42.127 --> 01:30:45.095
Mm-hmm. But, someday

01:30:45.097 --> 01:30:47.197
when you have kids of your own,

01:30:47.199 --> 01:30:48.864
- you will...
- Never,

01:30:48.866 --> 01:30:50.867
do anything like that to them.

01:30:50.869 --> 01:30:52.068
Ever.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:53.673
Okay.

01:30:55.139 --> 01:30:56.806
But they're sure gonna love
going over

01:30:56.808 --> 01:30:58.209
to Grandpa's house
for Christmas.

01:31:03.214 --> 01:31:04.850

- Mm-hmm.

- Huh?

01:31:45.891 --> 01:31:47.357
It looks like new.

01:31:47.359 --> 01:31:50.226
Be careful with that, Dad.
It's my inheritance, you know,

01:31:50.228 --> 01:31:52.263
if something tragic happens
to Nicky.

01:31:53.331 --> 01:31:55.265
Ahem. Who wants to go first?

01:31:55.267 --> 01:31:57.069

- Oh, come on up here, princess.

01:31:58.570 --> 01:31:59.938

01:32:00.338 --> 01:32:02.338

01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:04.407
I'm grateful that
my grandma's okay.

01:32:04.409 --> 01:32:07.042
And now the hospital
can see my grandma,

01:32:07.044 --> 01:32:09.011
and I love her,
and she's the only one

01:32:09.013 --> 01:32:10.180
who knows that I'll sing

01:32:10.182 --> 01:32:11.881
the "Jingle Bells Poo-poo"
song right.

01:32:11.883 --> 01:32:13.884
Thank you.

01:32:15.053 --> 01:32:16.385
Yes.

01:32:16.387 --> 01:32:18.153
All right.

01:32:18.155 --> 01:32:21.123
Um, I am grateful
that Mom is okay.

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:23.426

is not going to sue us

01:32:23.428 --> 01:32:24.894

01:32:26.264 --> 01:32:27.898

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.232
Oh, Um...

01:32:29.234 --> 01:32:30.302
Me first.

01:32:31.602 --> 01:32:32.903
- Hon.
- Okay.

01:32:32.905 --> 01:32:34.170
Um...

01:32:36.642 --> 01:32:38.675
I'm grateful

01:32:38.677 --> 01:32:41.912
that I have a family
who understands

01:32:41.914 --> 01:32:44.413
my passion for Christmas.

01:32:44.415 --> 01:32:48.318
Christmas <i>can do magic,</i>
if you believe.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.153
I believe, Daddy.

01:32:50.155 --> 01:32:51.253
Aw.

01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:52.792
Sweetie? Yes.

01:32:54.026 --> 01:32:55.259
Ah.

01:32:55.261 --> 01:32:57.661
- Huh?
- Why are you giving me that?

01:32:57.663 --> 01:32:58.729
We just wanted you to play

01:32:58.731 --> 01:32:59.962
a little Christmas music
for us, sweetie.

01:32:59.964 --> 01:33:02.332
Mom, I can't even look
at that thing right now.

01:33:02.334 --> 01:33:04.067
You're so good at it.

01:33:04.069 --> 01:33:05.702
Playing the tuba
reminds me of Tanner,

01:33:05.704 --> 01:33:09.005
and how I messed up
and lost him forever.

01:33:10.008 --> 01:33:11.942
Hmm.

01:33:11.944 --> 01:33:13.710
Nicky, actually
why don't you go next?

01:33:13.712 --> 01:33:14.944
Okay.

01:33:14.946 --> 01:33:16.011
There you go.

01:33:17.648 --> 01:33:19.185
And, uh, remember...

01:33:20.419 --> 01:33:22.217
It can do magic.

01:33:22.219 --> 01:33:23.822
Right.

01:33:33.365 --> 01:33:34.433
What?

01:33:56.221 --> 01:33:57.423
Tanner!

01:34:02.761 --> 01:34:04.330
That hat's magic.

01:34:07.132 --> 01:34:10.332
So which one
of my 400 texts convinced you?

01:34:10.334 --> 01:34:13.269
Actually, a very nice man
came over this morning,

01:34:13.271 --> 01:34:15.137
told me about
all the crazy things he's done

01:34:15.139 --> 01:34:17.474
to his family at Christmas
over the years.

01:34:17.476 --> 01:34:19.208
Once he got to that part
about you being attacked

01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:21.043
- by a reindeer...
- Mm-hmm.

01:34:21.045 --> 01:34:22.914
...started to understand
why you did what you did.

01:34:27.518 --> 01:34:28.887
Thanks, Dad.

01:34:30.454 --> 01:34:32.154
- I wanna thank you.
- Oh!

01:34:32.156 --> 01:34:33.523
I needed to see
Christmas like this.

01:34:33.525 --> 01:34:35.058
Ah!

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.027
It's what I do.

01:34:40.432 --> 01:34:42.001
Is someone in the cave?

01:34:44.035 --> 01:34:45.036
Sup?

01:34:52.410 --> 01:34:54.413
Maybe Christmas
isn't so bad after all.

01:35:05.589 --> 01:35:07.426
- Give me a hand?
- Sure.

01:35:08.826 --> 01:35:10.092
Steph?

01:35:10.094 --> 01:35:11.193
Dad?

01:35:11.195 --> 01:35:12.261
Okay.

01:35:12.263 --> 01:35:14.064
- Okay.
- On three.

01:35:14.066 --> 01:35:15.434
One, two, three.

01:35:23.075 --> 01:35:25.277
