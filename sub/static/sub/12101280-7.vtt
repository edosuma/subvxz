00:12.929 --> 00:15.765
-[dramatic music playing]
-[gunshots]

00:26.943 --> 00:28.820
[horse neighs]

00:36.369 --> 00:37.829
[Luda] Aleksander!

00:39.831 --> 00:40.749
You're here.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.254
-I was worried.
-[Luda] I was fine.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.715
I'm not as fragile as I once was.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.341
Not fragile.

00:51.509 --> 00:52.969
Just mortal.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.346
It's not safe out here.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.056
[Luda] I could live a long life.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.350
With training, with an amplifier.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.728
I could see another 100 years, maybe more.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.397
That seems a long time to you, I'm sure.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.356
[men shouting]

01:05.440 --> 01:06.649
-Soldiers.
-[horses neighing]

01:08.109 --> 01:09.611
Likely at Sikursk.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.698
They raided our village yesterday,
calling for all known Grisha.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.950
-A few of us got out.
-And Baghra?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.411
She led the others to the sanctuary.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.960
[horses approaching]

01:31.716 --> 01:32.717
[soldier] Darkling!

01:35.303 --> 01:36.638
I know you're in there!

01:41.351 --> 01:42.435
Remember Ryevost?

01:44.604 --> 01:45.438
The same plan?

02:01.329 --> 02:04.374
[Churik] It is you. Darkling.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.626
I approach peacefully.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.712
The King wants you back alive.

02:10.713 --> 02:14.092
But maybe you resisted. So…

02:15.135 --> 02:16.511
[grunts]

02:16.594 --> 02:18.680
[gasping]

02:27.313 --> 02:28.148
[grunts]

02:32.527 --> 02:33.528
Please.

02:41.035 --> 02:42.370
I don't want to hurt you.

02:42.453 --> 02:43.997
[grunting]

02:44.080 --> 02:45.582
[gasping]

02:51.337 --> 02:52.338
[groaning]

02:57.468 --> 02:58.469
[gasps]

02:58.553 --> 03:00.555
I have a message for the King.

03:02.223 --> 03:06.019
If he, or any of his men,
slaughter one more of my--

03:06.102 --> 03:07.812
-Stand down, Grisha.
-[Kirigan] Luda.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.232
Here's the little witch
who's been stitching him back together.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.692
-[Luda] I'm sorry.
-Luda.

03:12.775 --> 03:13.943
[Churik] Hands at your back!

03:14.819 --> 03:16.946
Or the next arrow will do its job.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.288
You have two prizes for the King.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.458
You want a promotion to lieutenant,
take us to the palace!

03:29.918 --> 03:32.879
I only need you. Not your Healer.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.048
[Kirigan grunts]

03:40.094 --> 03:41.012
-[grunting]
-What?

03:41.095 --> 03:44.349
You thought the two of you
could just quietly train witches among us?

03:45.183 --> 03:47.727
You want my cooperation,
you bring us both in.

03:47.810 --> 03:48.645
Is that understood?

03:48.728 --> 03:53.024
I told you, those were not our orders.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.528
No. No, no, please.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.905
No, I'm begging you, please!

03:59.530 --> 04:01.241
No! No!

04:01.324 --> 04:02.450
[Luda groaning]

04:04.577 --> 04:05.870
No!

04:18.174 --> 04:19.384
[softly] I'm sorry.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.596
[Churik] Now…

04:26.391 --> 04:27.809
you still have a message for him?

04:34.607 --> 04:35.733
[Kirigan] Yes.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.364
This!

04:42.991 --> 04:43.908
[yells]

05:09.475 --> 05:12.186
Healer! Is there a Healer here?

05:13.813 --> 05:16.316
-Do you have a Healer?
-The best we have is a Tailor.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.692
We were waiting on Luda.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.742
[man gasps] It's Luda.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.327
[people whispering]

05:39.380 --> 05:40.298
Just mortal.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.429
Where is Baghra?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.307
[Baghra coughing]

05:50.475 --> 05:51.809
-[Baghra] My son.
-I'm here.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.436
I'm here.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.940
But we do need to leave.
Soldiers are sweeping west.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.526
They're punishing us for being Grisha.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.569
Punishing you.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.696
You made him afraid.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.240
Now he wants you to fear him.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.575
I won a war for him.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.453
And in doing so, started a war on us.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.919
Oh, Aleksander.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.380
Where's the girl, your Healer?

06:22.173 --> 06:23.049
Dead.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.719
She died because of me.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.721
She died because they always do.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.473
They're not as strong as you and me.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.391
You're the one
who taught me how to kill, Mother.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.394
Their blood is on your hands
as much as mine.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.688
I taught you
so you could protect yourself.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.398
Not them.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.901
I told you as much,
but you are so stubborn.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.779
You wouldn't listen.

06:44.862 --> 06:45.905
Maybe you will now.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.993
Go. Flee. Go west. Go to Kerch.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.745
Wait for the King to die.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.373
Then return with a new name.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.083
-A nobleman's name.
-[sighs]

06:57.166 --> 07:00.378
Bide your time until there's
a problem only Grisha can solve.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.421
Then the King must embrace us.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.090
And what about those in danger now?

07:04.924 --> 07:08.469
We need to safeguard all Grisha.
We need to teach them how to fight.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.304
Most Grisha aren't fighters.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.099
They fix things. They make things.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.145
Then we make an army.

07:18.729 --> 07:19.814
Morozova did it.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.442
Forge new life to amplify our power.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.444
We are his bloodline. He made us, too.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.862
You mean to use merzost?

07:26.487 --> 07:29.490
We practice the Small Science. Not magic!

07:29.574 --> 07:31.951
His journals are here.
They're here in the archives.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.371
No, no, no, no, no. You cannot control it.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.915
I could create, just like he did.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.209
Then you will die. Like he did.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.628
It's unpredictable.

07:43.754 --> 07:44.672
Unstable.

07:45.339 --> 07:48.843
The Small Science feeds us.
Merzost feeds on us.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.428
I forbid it.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.180
Now, do you hear me?

08:15.828 --> 08:17.330
[mouthing]

08:22.668 --> 08:24.837
[murmuring indistinctly]

08:27.423 --> 08:28.257
[gasping]

08:32.261 --> 08:33.930
[bell tolling]

08:43.272 --> 08:44.398
[Tidemaker] The soldiers are here.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.025
-How many?
-Too many.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.121
[tolling continues]

09:06.337 --> 09:07.171
Darkling.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.095
You're surrounded.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.311
If you cut me down,
my men have orders to spare no one inside.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.689
You'll kill everyone.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.233
Including your mother.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.239
The King wants you in custody.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.742
We know you lost your Healer.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.039
Hold your arms wide.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.422
I know how your Small Science works.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.507
Your hands must touch first.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.099
If he moves his arms, shoot him.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.937
[speaking Old Ravkan]

10:12.903 --> 10:15.531
I have no army to fight yours,

10:15.615 --> 10:20.077
so I shall remake yours as my own.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.582
Submit to me!

10:35.301 --> 10:37.053
[gasping]

10:45.311 --> 10:47.146
[screaming]

11:13.214 --> 11:15.716
[thunder rumbling]

11:33.818 --> 11:35.444
[both panting]

11:41.659 --> 11:43.536
What did you do?

12:00.177 --> 12:01.470
I made something.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.275
[David] Sir, she is close by.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.827
Is this all we have left?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.164
[groans softly]

12:28.998 --> 12:30.458
Jesper, my bag.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.335
[gags]

12:33.419 --> 12:34.545
Mother of Saints.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.464
[Jesper clears throat]

12:37.256 --> 12:39.258
[Inej groaning and breathing heavily]

12:41.802 --> 12:45.181
It's not healing on its own.
I need to stitch it.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.142
-How long before you can travel?
-Not long.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.977
-Where?
-[Kaz] Ketterdam.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.361
Between our dwindling funds,

12:59.445 --> 13:02.865
lack of time and conflicting interests,

13:04.909 --> 13:06.327
it's time we cut our losses.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.746
[barn door opens]

13:10.831 --> 13:12.583
I guess the Bastard misses the Barrel.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.460
[exhales sharply]

13:16.795 --> 13:18.214
[groans]

13:18.297 --> 13:21.842
You can watch a bullet tear through a man,
but a needle's too much?

13:22.968 --> 13:23.802
It…

13:23.886 --> 13:26.514
Yeah, well, you see,
bullets are bam, in and out. That's…

13:26.597 --> 13:27.598
That's just…

13:27.681 --> 13:28.516
[gags]

13:29.725 --> 13:30.559
[Inej grunts]

13:31.560 --> 13:34.146
-Where'd you learn to do that?
-When I was at the Menagerie.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.397
Yeah, but why would you…

13:36.857 --> 13:37.858
Oh, that's dark.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.361
Which is why I can't go back.

13:41.820 --> 13:45.115
If you told Kaz that story,
I think he'd murder Heleen himself.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.618
Jesper, you're not hearing me.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.746
I can't go back.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.337
[Jesper clears throat]

13:59.129 --> 14:00.047
What?

14:00.130 --> 14:01.090
Well, I was…

14:03.509 --> 14:05.427
I was going to tell you to trust Kaz

14:06.011 --> 14:07.972
and that he'd never let you go back, but…

14:10.266 --> 14:11.642
I don't have the right to tell you

14:11.725 --> 14:13.686
what you should do
with your shot at freedom.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.900
You make this a lot harder, you know.

14:20.859 --> 14:21.694
I know.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.488
I'd miss me, too.

14:25.447 --> 14:26.574
I'm fantastic.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.457
[Alina shivering]

14:40.754 --> 14:43.883
Mal, when we find the Stag,
I need to be the one to kill it.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.095
You're a terrible shot.
They made you a cartographer for a reason.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.599
[Alina laughs]

14:52.725 --> 14:56.103
Of course. I'll line it up for you,
you take the shot.

15:00.941 --> 15:01.859
It's just…

15:04.403 --> 15:06.071
Do you really wear its bones?

15:07.698 --> 15:08.532
Yeah.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.287
At least, that's how it's been done.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.209
[faint rustling]

15:24.965 --> 15:26.467
[animal grunting in distance]

15:28.177 --> 15:29.803
[rustling]

15:35.935 --> 15:36.852
That way.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.941
-Hang on.
-What are you doing?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.401
I need to get closer to it.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.777
If we keep it alive, how do we--

16:26.860 --> 16:27.736
I don't know.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.447
Kirigan didn't want me
to have an amplifier.

16:31.156 --> 16:31.991
[snorts]

16:32.074 --> 16:33.450
So he didn't teach me about this.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.161
Maybe there's another way to do this.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.231
[gasps]

17:16.326 --> 17:17.661
-[gunshot]
-[Stag bellows]

17:27.046 --> 17:28.589
[Stag grunts]

17:28.672 --> 17:30.257
That animal's not meant for you.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.428
[grunts]

17:34.511 --> 17:35.429
[Alina] Mal!

17:38.599 --> 17:39.725
-[flesh squelches]
-[groans]

17:39.808 --> 17:41.560
[heart beating rapidly]

17:50.944 --> 17:51.820
[Alina panting]

17:51.904 --> 17:52.905
Okay.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.532
[both grunt]

17:59.328 --> 18:01.080
[screaming]

18:01.163 --> 18:02.790
[both breathing heavily]

18:21.934 --> 18:22.893
[Alina] No!

18:28.982 --> 18:30.359
You can't save them, Alina.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.194
[Stag whimpering]

18:32.277 --> 18:33.946
You may have the power of light,

18:36.824 --> 18:38.408
but not the power to heal.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.453
I know the tracker is important to you.

18:44.289 --> 18:48.627
Give me the Stag,
and I'll have my Healer save him.

18:52.923 --> 18:53.757
No.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.096
[Alina] Stay still.
You've lost too much blood.

19:00.848 --> 19:01.890
You have to kill it.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.894
[whimpering]

19:09.731 --> 19:10.649
You have to.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.443
[grunts]

19:16.655 --> 19:19.616
-[Alina] No! No! No! No!
-[Mal groaning]

19:19.700 --> 19:20.659
[Alina] No.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.289
No! You said you wouldn't hurt him!

19:39.428 --> 19:40.512
Bring me its antlers.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.306
Yes, sir.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.891
[crying] You murderer!

19:43.974 --> 19:45.642
You stupid fool!

19:46.351 --> 19:47.978
And the otkazat'sya, sir?

19:48.061 --> 19:49.188
[sniffles]

19:49.813 --> 19:51.273
[Kirigan] I am a man of my word.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.276
Heal him.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.656
He was only protecting Miss Starkov.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.753
Are you hungry?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.467
Or just saying goodbye?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.182
Jesper fixed your cane.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.069
So, you are leaving.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.573
That's it?

20:44.785 --> 20:45.744
After everything,

20:47.496 --> 20:49.539
there's nothing else
you want to say to me?

20:50.624 --> 20:51.583
What else is there?

20:59.800 --> 21:00.801
You were right!

21:07.099 --> 21:08.016
About what?

21:10.477 --> 21:11.436
The Sun Summoner.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.440
You were right.

21:17.901 --> 21:18.902
She's real.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.954
I played it over and over in my head.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.498
None of it's a trick.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.334
The light was hers.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.297
So, what?

21:39.756 --> 21:41.925
Kaz Brekker finally believes in Saints?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.802
-Hardly.
-But you just said that--

21:43.885 --> 21:47.973
I said Alina Starkov is a Grisha
with the power to manipulate light.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.517
She's a girl with a gift,
not some savior of lore.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.519
[sighing] Fine.

21:53.687 --> 21:57.482
Kaz, if not Saints,
what do you believe in?

21:59.484 --> 22:00.360
Myself.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.946
-Why'd I even ask?
-And you.

22:07.034 --> 22:07.951
And Jesper.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.579
My Crows.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.333
Because we flock to your bidding?

22:15.125 --> 22:17.586
Like the animals of vengeance
you named us after?

22:20.255 --> 22:23.383
Crows don't just remember
the faces of people who wronged them.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.096
They also remember those who were kind.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.978
They tell each other who to look after
and who to watch out for.

22:39.858 --> 22:42.069
No Saint ever watched over me.

22:45.906 --> 22:46.907
Not like you have.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.006
I can't go back to the Menagerie.

23:05.926 --> 23:06.843
You won't.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.279
[Alina] What are you doing?

23:28.490 --> 23:30.200
I'm going to place this around your neck.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.201
I meant why?

23:31.284 --> 23:33.787
I didn't kill the Stag.
It's not my amplifier.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.997
He killed it. He gets its power.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.583
You asked for this yourself, when we met.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.798
To transfer your gift
to someone who could use it.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.174
I can use it now.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.302
[Kirigan] You know so little.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.012
You'll learn.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.305
I know things.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.558
General Kirigan, is it?

23:55.308 --> 23:56.768
Or is Aleksander a fake name, too?

23:56.852 --> 23:59.020
Careful with your words, Alina.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.858
Consider whose life is in your hands.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.944
You said you'd let him go.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.240
I said I would heal him.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.909
What happens next is up to you.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.870
None of this has been up to me!

24:30.010 --> 24:33.972
Do you know the only thing
more powerful than you or me?

24:37.809 --> 24:40.562
The two of us. Together.

24:41.688 --> 24:45.859
Together, we can end all wars.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.778
We can protect our own.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.781
Is that not what you want?

24:53.783 --> 24:55.785
Are we destroying the Fold?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.540
We can do anything.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.171
Together.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.122
[Alina] What… What's happening?

25:43.333 --> 25:46.086
Wait. I don't understand. What…

25:46.169 --> 25:48.296
[heart beating loudly]

26:08.817 --> 26:09.776
[breathing heavily]

26:15.907 --> 26:17.033
[David] That should, uh…

26:19.077 --> 26:20.287
[Kirigan] Bridge the gap?

26:21.037 --> 26:21.871
Yes.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.501
You should now have full access
to all of her light.

26:28.003 --> 26:28.837
In theory.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.188
[Alina panting]

26:48.398 --> 26:49.983
This is my power.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.951
[Kirigan] But now I control it.

27:03.538 --> 27:04.664
[Alina groans]

27:27.395 --> 27:29.272
-[Inej] How many are there?
-[Kaz] Two.

27:29.356 --> 27:30.482
At some point, one of them

27:30.565 --> 27:32.525
will have to go tell a superior
what they found.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.526
We'll go in then.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.779
[Jesper] Not to be that person, Kaz,

27:35.862 --> 27:38.365
but are you sure you can drive that thing?

27:38.448 --> 27:39.282
Yes.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.452
On the way to Kribirsk,
while you were busy hugging bait…

27:42.535 --> 27:44.287
Milo. The goat's name was Milo.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.706
…I was memorizing Arken's timings.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.458
Not to gang up on you,

27:48.541 --> 27:50.377
but Jes has a point.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.463
Arken's system was complicated
and the ride was chaotic.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.840
No one would blame you
for missing a count.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.426
"Jes"?

28:00.178 --> 28:01.763
It's Suli, for friendship.

28:02.722 --> 28:03.556
No, it's not.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.976
Trust me. Arken and I think alike.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.228
[explosion]

28:12.982 --> 28:15.360
Too soon to appreciate the irony,
am I right?

28:20.740 --> 28:21.741
[softly] Yeah, too soon.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.120
[horses neighing]

29:00.697 --> 29:02.365
Mal! Mal!

29:02.949 --> 29:04.367
-Alina!
-[Alina] No! Mal!

29:04.993 --> 29:06.911
[grunting] Mal! No, Mal!

29:23.386 --> 29:24.262
[gasps]

29:31.394 --> 29:32.562
You look awful.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.775
[Alina gasps]

29:38.026 --> 29:40.612
The Little Palace
hasn't been the same without you.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.281
Oh, Genya.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.992
I need to get word
to the King about Kirigan.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.496
The King's been taken ill.
His affliction is quite serious.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.332
The Apparat's been ruling in his stead.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.836
-And the Queen?
-Confined to her quarters.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.589
No one wants her exposed
to the King's contagion.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.468
Right.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.012
You were made Corporalnik?

30:06.095 --> 30:06.930
[Genya] Hmm.

30:08.097 --> 30:10.016
I never did like this color red.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.352
It clashes with my hair.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.192
You said Kirigan gifted you to the Queen
when you were 11.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.237
Does that mean…

30:29.869 --> 30:31.037
You were a spy for him.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.331
I tried to warn you.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.252
"Be careful of powerful men"?

30:38.545 --> 30:40.296
You should have included devious women.

30:41.631 --> 30:42.590
The King's illness,

30:43.758 --> 30:47.470
we can assume you had both the inclination
and the proximity to make that happen?

30:52.976 --> 30:55.979
My letters to Mal, you never sent them.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.023
I had no choice.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.358
Except that you did.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.986
And you chose to betray our friendship.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.071
I was a whipping girl for the Queen

31:05.154 --> 31:06.906
and a Grisha without a color. I…

31:08.283 --> 31:11.911
Choosing friendship over survival
was not a luxury I could afford.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.581
I know what it means
to be an outsider struggling to survive.

31:14.664 --> 31:15.498
And it's no excuse.

31:24.340 --> 31:25.675
I used to struggle.

31:27.468 --> 31:28.678
I used to try…

31:31.139 --> 31:32.181
to fight him off.

31:34.517 --> 31:35.768
That never worked in my favor.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.523
I waited for years
for my chance of revenge.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.443
To finally bring him
a fight that he cannot…

31:45.069 --> 31:46.738
That he cannot fend off.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.658
I never expected it to come to this. Here.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.412
Wouldn't you have done the same
if you were me?

31:59.459 --> 32:02.545
The King deserves
every bit of your vengeance.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.092
But Kirigan does not deserve your loyalty.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.180
He is just as responsible
for your position.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.681
I am his soldier.

32:16.017 --> 32:16.851
We all are.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.731
We are his pawns. Nothing more.

32:34.702 --> 32:36.996
The skiff is still here.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.375
Travelers downstairs are complaining.
They were due to cross this morning.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.503
Orders from the Black General.
He plans to cross on it tomorrow.

32:43.586 --> 32:44.587
The general?

32:45.171 --> 32:48.174
Is that the same general who tried to…
Oh, yeah, kill us all.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.717
That one?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.052
He has the Sun Summoner.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.472
Was this your plan all along?

32:54.555 --> 32:57.141
To have the general get her back
so you can take her again?

32:57.225 --> 32:59.435
My plan is to get us across the Fold.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.146
We aren't prepared for another fight.

33:02.897 --> 33:05.316
So you're not going
to take another run at Alina?

33:05.400 --> 33:08.111
And you're really willing
to let a million kruge go?

33:13.700 --> 33:15.576
Jesper and I can't do it without you.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.078
Been saying that since day one.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.457
And you've made your position
perfectly clear.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.669
So all you want is to cross the Fold?

33:28.548 --> 33:31.342
Once we land in Novokribirsk,
it's your choice what you do next.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.056
Okay.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.060
Hang on.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.648
Are we talking about boarding a skiff
with people who will recognize us?

33:46.315 --> 33:48.484
People who don't like us much.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.570
We'll have to blend in.
Who else was on that skiff?

33:51.320 --> 33:53.156
Some people from the winter fete.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.867
Dignitaries from Kerch and Novyi Zem
on their way back home.

33:56.909 --> 33:58.786
Now they're audience
to one more light show.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.083
Jesper, how did you enjoy
playing a Zemeni guard?

34:10.965 --> 34:12.383
[thunder rumbling]

34:14.719 --> 34:15.553
[Mal grunts]

34:23.144 --> 34:23.978
You?

34:27.148 --> 34:28.608
You come here to kill me off?

34:30.109 --> 34:30.943
No.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.781
How many times
do I have to tell you people?

34:35.573 --> 34:37.200
I'm a man of my word.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.410
And when does your word mean anything?

34:41.329 --> 34:42.288
Black Heretic.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.876
That's right, I know who you are.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.588
And whatever you have planned for Alina,
she won't forgive you.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.716
And if you keep me alive,

34:54.759 --> 34:56.094
I will hunt you down

34:56.844 --> 34:59.722
and I will claim the bounty
the old King put on your head.

35:06.020 --> 35:10.608
Alina has strong feelings for you.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.112
And you for her.

35:18.032 --> 35:19.033
I read your letters.

35:21.035 --> 35:25.873
All these years,
you never truly appreciated who she is.

35:26.791 --> 35:30.586
But it's all right, because I do.

35:30.670 --> 35:31.838
[snickers]

35:35.049 --> 35:38.636
Oh, you have no chance, shadow man.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.431
Because I'm the one she chose.

35:42.515 --> 35:43.933
You are a child.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.644
And she is Grisha.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.565
Take away my shadows

35:51.315 --> 35:53.151
and I still have something that you don't.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.570
Patience.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.614
Alina may well take years to forgive me,

36:00.449 --> 36:01.826
but I can wait.

36:03.536 --> 36:04.453
Meanwhile,

36:06.205 --> 36:07.540
you will grow old.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.710
Your hair will gray.

36:12.628 --> 36:15.131
And she will remain ageless.

36:16.382 --> 36:17.383
Like me.

36:19.093 --> 36:20.094
And one day,

36:21.012 --> 36:22.555
maybe a year from now,

36:24.015 --> 36:25.183
maybe 50,

36:26.767 --> 36:30.104
she'll realize
that she has only one equal.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.940
That there are no others like us.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.903
And that there never will be.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.782
I'm not going to kill you, Mal.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.535
I don't need to.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.457
Time will do it for me.

36:54.128 --> 36:55.796
You'll wish you killed me here!

37:00.218 --> 37:02.011
[indistinct chatter]

37:10.811 --> 37:11.646
[man 1 grunts]

37:12.230 --> 37:13.272
[groans]

37:14.398 --> 37:16.484
-[Jesper] Are you all right?
-[man 2] What's going on?

37:16.567 --> 37:17.485
What are-- [grunts]

37:22.782 --> 37:23.741
Are you gonna help?

37:25.409 --> 37:26.619
Oh.

37:26.702 --> 37:28.746
Well, isn't that convenient for you?

37:33.793 --> 37:35.169
-You look fine.
-[laughs]

37:35.253 --> 37:36.796
Oh, I look more than fine.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.382
I made some edits to their papers.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.385
Should be enough to get us
through the checkpoint and onto the skiff.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.345
Huh?

37:44.971 --> 37:47.473
No one is ever
going to believe I'm that old.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.976
You tell yourself that.

37:52.311 --> 37:53.271
[clears throat]

37:58.442 --> 37:59.568
[sighs]

38:00.820 --> 38:01.988
[goat bleating]

38:20.464 --> 38:22.008
-[chain rattles]
-[grunts]

38:38.107 --> 38:38.941
[clicking tongue]

38:39.525 --> 38:40.359
Come on.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.112
[clicking tongue]

38:43.821 --> 38:46.115
Come on. Come on.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.534
Yes. Yes.

38:48.617 --> 38:52.288
Oh, you're beautiful, aren't you?
Yes, you're a good boy.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.290
You're a good boy.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.500
Oh, thank you. [kisses]

38:56.584 --> 38:58.669
[sniffs] You smell.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.352
[clangs]

39:36.707 --> 39:37.541
[whispers] Thanks.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.854
You are special.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.649
You do know that?

40:03.651 --> 40:05.820
And you're about to prove it to the world.

40:06.570 --> 40:09.573
There will be foreign diplomats
on this crossing of the Fold.

40:11.325 --> 40:13.702
If you want me
to play along with your demonstration,

40:13.786 --> 40:14.745
you will release Mal.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.207
Please. I just want to talk to you.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.293
I've had enough of your lies.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.254
And what lies are those?

40:27.174 --> 40:28.426
About the Black Heretic.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.929
You spun all this guilt
around your burden,

40:32.012 --> 40:33.764
the sins of your father.

40:33.848 --> 40:34.890
There was no father.

40:36.642 --> 40:38.060
You created the Fold.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.813
You killed my friends.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.106
My parents.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.777
And now your perversion of power
extends to me.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.280
Baghra.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.034
How could you so easily believe

40:54.118 --> 40:57.371
the twisted words
of that angry, old woman?

40:57.455 --> 40:58.497
And who should I believe?

40:58.581 --> 41:00.749
You've been lying to me
since the day I met you.

41:00.833 --> 41:03.461
Telling you half a story
is not the same as lying.

41:04.753 --> 41:08.549
And what about conspiring with the Apparat
to poison the King and usurp the throne?

41:09.925 --> 41:12.970
Did you? Or did you want
to tell half-truths about that, too?

41:13.053 --> 41:15.931
Continuing to serve such a king

41:16.015 --> 41:18.142
would make me a traitor to my country.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.770
-And my conscience.
-So then you're a martyr?

41:22.771 --> 41:25.941
I would've thought you of all people
would understand what it's like.

41:27.526 --> 41:28.569
To live in hiding

41:28.652 --> 41:30.821
for fear of being murdered
simply for being.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.783
It's why I built the Little Palace
in the first place.

41:34.867 --> 41:39.413
Everything that I have done,
everything that I have ever done,

41:40.039 --> 41:43.334
has been to make Ravka safer,
to make Grisha safer!

41:43.417 --> 41:44.710
Did you think Genya was safe

41:44.793 --> 41:46.712
when you placed her
under the King's watch?

41:47.213 --> 41:49.590
Am I to believe
that you will show Baghra mercy?

41:51.258 --> 41:54.345
I could have made Grisha safe,
but you never gave me a choice.

41:58.474 --> 41:59.475
Perhaps.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.686
But you have given me one.

42:03.812 --> 42:07.650
A chance to make amends. To finally win.

42:07.733 --> 42:10.861
-The Fold was not your mistake--
-The Fold was no mistake!

42:12.196 --> 42:15.199
I never intended
for it to be the blight it's become.

42:15.282 --> 42:19.245
Or for men like the King or Zlatan
to exploit it for their own gain.

42:19.328 --> 42:23.082
You put this collar on me
to exploit my power for your gain!

42:23.165 --> 42:24.875
For us.

42:26.126 --> 42:30.089
To help us conquer the Fold together.

42:31.131 --> 42:32.341
You and me.

42:34.385 --> 42:38.556
You cannot do this on your own.

42:42.810 --> 42:43.894
And neither can I.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.106
We could've had this.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.568
All of it.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.196
You could've made me your equal.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.159
Instead, you made me this.

43:07.793 --> 43:11.630
You don't care who suffers,
as long as you win.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.516
Fine.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.062
Make me your villain.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.784
Sir. The tracker has escaped.

43:43.078 --> 43:43.912
What?

43:43.996 --> 43:46.582
Sometime last night.
I have a team looking for him.

43:49.251 --> 43:51.920
If he flees, good.

43:52.755 --> 43:57.009
If he gets anywhere near Miss Starkov,
put him down.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.140
[Ivan] Consider yourself lucky.

44:03.223 --> 44:06.310
You're travelling with the Black General
and the Sun Summoner,

44:06.894 --> 44:10.105
which means you are about to witness
the destruction of the Fold.

44:24.328 --> 44:27.206
I know. I look amazing for my age.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.501
Well, I thought you looked older.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.252
[laughs]

44:40.844 --> 44:42.221
[people whispering]

44:49.061 --> 44:52.314
I know. Not until Novokribirsk.

45:24.638 --> 45:27.391
The tracker's being kept
in camp, under guard.

45:28.308 --> 45:31.228
Do what's expected of you
and he'll be released.

45:39.945 --> 45:41.738
This isn't a good look for you.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.032
Everyone will see that I'm your prisoner.

45:44.116 --> 45:46.702
I doubt very much
they'll notice your feet.

46:08.557 --> 46:11.768
Good news?
It's just as terrifying as I remember.

46:11.852 --> 46:14.354
Except this time
we're going in completely exposed.

46:16.815 --> 46:18.859
[growling in distance]

46:22.321 --> 46:25.365
If I'm meant to die today,
and either of you two survive,

46:26.366 --> 46:27.659
make sure I have an open casket.

46:27.743 --> 46:29.161
No one's dying today.

46:30.704 --> 46:31.705
No mourners.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.999
No funerals.

46:39.963 --> 46:41.381
[thunder rumbling]
