01:38.044 --> 01:40.638
Rajjo, are you pregnant?
Why are you not opening the door?

01:40.714 --> 01:41.840
I'm barking since
half-an-hour standing outside.

01:41.915 --> 01:44.713
I managed to control my pee
for the last one hour.

01:44.785 --> 01:48.414
I'd a tough time controlling
the pee because of potholes.

01:48.488 --> 01:50.479
You don't understand that.

02:03.970 --> 02:07.701
Tell me something. When you stop
breathing, does the urine also stop?

02:07.941 --> 02:09.771
Now stop it.

02:24.758 --> 02:26.282
Three teas.

02:26.359 --> 02:27.656
Okay.

02:40.907 --> 02:42.340
I'm sitting here.

02:42.876 --> 02:44.901
We are sitting and
you are standing.

02:45.712 --> 02:46.838
This is my place.

02:49.783 --> 02:51.683
Is your father's name
written on it?

02:51.952 --> 02:53.351
Yes.

02:54.888 --> 02:57.083
What's written here? Liquid.

02:57.424 --> 03:00.359
This is my name written in capital
letters and I'm not your father.

03:00.427 --> 03:02.793
But my illegitimate child will
not be illegitimate like you.

03:02.863 --> 03:05.024
Mind your language.
- You listen to me.

03:05.298 --> 03:06.629
Calm down.

03:08.702 --> 03:10.727
I will take your luggage there.
Come.

03:10.804 --> 03:14.262
Is this the way you talk to someone?
- Get away from here.

03:15.375 --> 03:19.505
Liquid, don't be so hot
else you'll evaporate one day.

03:23.850 --> 03:28.412
Tell me one thing, Liquid. Is it
necessary for you to wear formals?

03:28.488 --> 03:30.285
As it is, you look like an idiot.

03:30.357 --> 03:32.348
Wearing formals you look a jerk.

03:32.893 --> 03:36.420
I look like an idiot,
but you're an idiot.

03:36.496 --> 03:38.293
The company you work
for has no standard.

03:38.331 --> 03:39.491
Employees wear knickers to office.

03:39.599 --> 03:43.433
Wonder what their intention is.

03:43.470 --> 03:45.597
Our company is standard one..

03:45.672 --> 03:46.866
..and we are not going
to dance on boss's tunes.

03:46.940 --> 03:50.432
We get money for work and
not for saying 'yes sir.'

03:53.647 --> 03:54.841
Why are you upset?

03:54.915 --> 04:00.376
The manager. She's become
a manager just by decking herself.

04:01.555 --> 04:04.490
Who does she think she is?

04:04.558 --> 04:07.356
Wretched woman.

04:10.330 --> 04:11.763
The tea tastes terrible.

04:11.798 --> 04:14.289
Liquid, don't say anything
to my tea.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.528
The food may be of substandard
quality but not the tea.

04:16.603 --> 04:17.695
I make it myself.

04:17.771 --> 04:20.296
The food is substandard and
the tea too is substandard.

04:20.406 --> 04:22.807
You use sewage water
to prepare tea.

04:22.842 --> 04:24.605
They urinate in it
and drink the same.

04:24.644 --> 04:26.635
You prepare tea yourself.

04:29.849 --> 04:32.511
I'm a dog. An American dog.

04:32.819 --> 04:35.947
I bite and bark
whenever they ask me to.

04:36.022 --> 04:38.991
I go behind wagging my
tail just for Rs. 34,000.

04:40.026 --> 04:43.928
I've decided. I'll quit my job.
I will not go from tomorrow.

04:43.997 --> 04:45.760
They can do nothing.
The company won't be closed.

04:45.832 --> 04:47.026
I will not go from tomorrow.

04:49.436 --> 04:53.304
Liquid, you only say,
but don't do anything.

04:53.373 --> 04:55.307
You are very bold.

04:55.508 --> 04:56.941
You said you're going to
open a cafÃ© shop. Did you?

04:57.010 --> 04:58.773
Let me gather money.

04:58.812 --> 05:02.578
I am waiting for that,
but who are you waiting for?

05:03.249 --> 05:04.341
You don't know.

05:04.417 --> 05:06.783
They ruined his happiness
when he joined the company.

05:07.020 --> 05:08.851
He's waiting to regain it.

05:10.323 --> 05:12.723
All right. Laugh. Look
what I'm going to do tomorrow.

05:13.426 --> 05:14.518
Tomorrow is Saturday.

05:14.594 --> 05:17.495
Just wait and watch.
I will not go on Monday too.

05:18.398 --> 05:22.266
All right. Don't go. But why
you're spoiling the night?

05:22.636 --> 05:25.332
Will you have liquor? - No.
I will have pee. Will you also have?

05:25.405 --> 05:26.531
I will slap you.

05:26.606 --> 05:27.664
I'll cremate you in this gutter..

05:27.741 --> 05:29.003
..and your corpse will
also not be recovered.

05:29.275 --> 05:30.674
You have only one bone in your body.

05:30.744 --> 05:33.975
You listen..
- No, you keep quiet.

05:37.050 --> 05:38.608
Even you apologize.

05:39.653 --> 05:41.052
Okay. I am sorry.

05:41.321 --> 05:42.788
You better.

05:49.329 --> 05:51.991
Mr. Choube, the tea is good.

05:52.065 --> 05:53.896
The tiredness just disappears.

05:54.567 --> 05:56.831
The smell of the gutter
and your tea.

05:58.438 --> 06:02.238
Liquid, you are frustrated.
You need a girl friend.

06:02.308 --> 06:06.574
You remember Ruchi Srivastava?
She looks beautiful these days.

06:06.646 --> 06:09.911
She was very simple
and now you see her.

06:09.983 --> 06:11.974
She has enticed a manager.

06:12.252 --> 06:13.685
Stop.

06:14.721 --> 06:16.655
You must take a look someday.

06:39.279 --> 06:44.342
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

06:45.452 --> 06:50.822
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

06:52.659 --> 06:55.787
''A cooker of friends and
the smile is the whistle.''

06:55.862 --> 06:58.990
''Whenever it whistled,
it was great.''

06:59.065 --> 07:01.932
''A cooker of friends and
the smile is the whistle.''

07:02.001 --> 07:07.633
''Whenever it whistled,
it was great.''

07:07.774 --> 07:13.576
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

07:14.280 --> 07:21.846
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

07:34.734 --> 07:40.604
''If you have a problem.
Then it is your issue.''

07:41.508 --> 07:46.912
''We don't have a
kerchief or a tissue.''

07:47.514 --> 07:54.386
''There's a fog of smoke
and booze overflowing.''

07:54.420 --> 08:02.384
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

08:46.873 --> 08:52.573
''We earn through code..
we abuse the code.''

08:53.379 --> 08:59.011
''We even search for our
boxers in the google.''

08:59.719 --> 09:06.352
''Our scriptures are told by Floyd.''

09:06.526 --> 09:12.624
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

09:12.732 --> 09:18.967
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

09:19.372 --> 09:24.810
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

09:25.578 --> 09:36.455
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

09:39.893 --> 09:42.919
''Why to think about anyone..

09:42.996 --> 09:45.624
..or take tensions?''

09:46.332 --> 09:48.892
''We saw everyone..

09:49.469 --> 09:52.666
..and measured everyone.''

09:52.705 --> 10:02.410
''We are the leaders of vagabonds.''

10:02.482 --> 10:08.352
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

10:08.855 --> 10:16.785
''Life is great.
There's no tension.''

10:52.899 --> 10:54.457
Yes.

10:56.769 --> 10:58.703
Pee at home.

10:59.605 --> 11:03.268
Guys are brave.

11:03.710 --> 11:05.803
Brave as Lion.

11:05.878 --> 11:08.472
Do lions pee in the toilet?

11:08.548 --> 11:10.675
No.
- Lions pee.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.808
Brave Lions.

11:11.884 --> 11:16.583
The lions pee in the open air under
the blue sky.

11:16.656 --> 11:19.784
Anywhere they want.
Stop it if you can.

11:19.826 --> 11:21.020
Come on.

11:41.381 --> 11:44.646
Why do you update each
and everything on facebook?

11:45.051 --> 11:47.986
Is it really necessary?

11:48.488 --> 11:49.819
The picture quality is good.

11:50.857 --> 11:52.017
Five mega picture.

11:52.091 --> 11:55.618
You take in your mouth and
put the photo on the facebook.

11:57.563 --> 11:59.531
Take it.

12:02.035 --> 12:05.527
Rajjo, I must say.
You look gorgeous in this pose.

12:06.973 --> 12:09.635
Hey.
- ''Take this girl.''

12:09.709 --> 12:11.802
You. Get away.

12:11.878 --> 12:15.473
Rajjo, get him a girl.
Else I'm not going to stay with him.

12:15.548 --> 12:18.574
What do you mean?
You think I have stock of girls?

12:22.522 --> 12:25.980
What?
- Choudhary, I wish we had.

12:29.328 --> 12:30.522
Hey Rajjo!

12:30.596 --> 12:33.588
''I got my first real six string.''

12:33.666 --> 12:36.692
''Bought it at the five and dime.''

12:37.070 --> 12:39.868
''Played it till my fingers bled.''

12:40.073 --> 12:43.440
''It was the summer of 69.''

12:44.043 --> 12:46.944
''Me and some from school..

12:47.380 --> 12:50.440
..had a band and
we tried real hard.''

12:50.716 --> 12:53.981
''Jimmy quit and
Jody got married.''

12:54.053 --> 12:57.420
''I should've known
we never get far.''

12:57.657 --> 12:58.885
Come on, Choudhary.

12:58.958 --> 13:04.260
''I waited till I saw the sun.''

13:04.764 --> 13:09.861
''I don't know why I didn't come.''

13:10.436 --> 13:14.839
''I left you by the house of fun.''

13:15.741 --> 13:20.269
''I don't know why I didn't come.''

13:20.580 --> 13:22.480
Why don't you too go and sing.

13:22.782 --> 13:24.477
Go, Choudhary.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.315
Let's do it.

13:31.524 --> 13:36.962
''Pour some sugar on me
in the name of love.''

13:37.029 --> 13:42.729
''Pour some sugar on me,
come on, fire me up.''

13:42.768 --> 13:48.673
''Pour your sugar on me,
I can't get enough.''

13:49.675 --> 13:53.907
''He met Marmalade
down in Moulin Rouge.''

13:54.313 --> 13:57.612
''Strutting her stuff
on the street.''

13:58.384 --> 14:00.443
''She said 'hello, hey Joe.''

14:00.520 --> 14:02.784
''You want to give it a go?''

14:03.656 --> 14:07.353
''Damn you's a sexy bitch,
you's a sexy bitch.''

14:07.393 --> 14:10.851
''Damn you's a sexy bitch,
damn, girl.''

14:10.930 --> 14:14.696
''Damn you's a sexy bitch,
you's a sexy bitch.''

14:14.734 --> 14:16.964
''Damn you's a sexy bitch..''

14:17.637 --> 14:21.767
''I'm a get, get, get, get you drunk.
Get you love drunk off my hump.''

14:21.841 --> 14:25.277
''My hump, my hump, my hump,
my hump, my hump.''

14:25.344 --> 14:29.041
''My hump, my hump, my hump,
my lovely little lumps.''

14:29.315 --> 14:30.441
''Check it out.''

14:35.721 --> 14:37.814
''I'll take you to the candy shop.''

14:38.057 --> 14:40.457
''I'll let you lick the lollypop.''

14:40.660 --> 14:42.719
''Go ahead girl, don't you stop.''

14:42.962 --> 14:46.420
''Keep going till you hit the spot.''

14:53.306 --> 14:54.739
You go, I'll join in sometime.

14:58.911 --> 15:00.674
Hope you weren't offended.

15:00.713 --> 15:03.273
My friend Liquid is a little insane.
- Liquid.

15:03.716 --> 15:07.777
Nishant we call him
Liquid since he spreads a lot.

15:08.821 --> 15:10.618
But you don't feel offended.

15:11.023 --> 15:12.490
Not at all.

15:12.558 --> 15:13.855
Great. Have fun.

15:18.331 --> 15:22.290
Thought he will ask for number.
He turned out be naÃ¯ve.

15:27.039 --> 15:28.802
I'll be right back.

15:29.609 --> 15:30.803
Excuse me.

15:30.876 --> 15:32.366
Yes?

15:32.578 --> 15:37.447
I thought about it and I realized
that I felt a little offended.

15:37.850 --> 15:39.750
And since I felt offended..

15:39.819 --> 15:42.720
..don't you think you should
do something to please me?

15:42.755 --> 15:43.949
As what?

15:44.390 --> 15:48.724
Coffee tomorrow.
Just to apologise.

15:48.761 --> 15:52.288
Liquid will not agree.
He doesn't apologise.

15:52.765 --> 15:55.290
I'll still try to send him.

15:55.468 --> 15:56.560
Okay.

15:56.636 --> 15:58.501
CCD at 12.

16:05.745 --> 16:07.406
For how long
will you watch yourself?

16:07.480 --> 16:09.812
I got it. I will forward it. Sure.

16:11.784 --> 16:13.809
Do one thing. Go nude.

16:13.886 --> 16:16.320
Shut up, Liquid.
- Why are you getting so tensed?

16:16.522 --> 16:19.491
Wear anything. You look
handsome in anything you wear.

16:19.558 --> 16:22.959
You have soiled my shirt.
I suffered a loss of Rs. 14.

16:23.729 --> 16:26.254
Where are you going? - Don't you see
the ID around my neck?

16:26.332 --> 16:27.458
But today is Sunday.

16:27.533 --> 16:30.730
There is no Sunday for the dogs.
Dogs are dogs for all seven days.

16:30.803 --> 16:33.431
The Manager can ask
us to come any time.

16:53.893 --> 16:55.588
Hi.
- Hi.

17:03.269 --> 17:06.500
I tried so much,
but Liquid didn't agree.

17:06.705 --> 17:09.266
So thought
I'll apologize on his behalf.

17:11.944 --> 17:13.877
Had he come it would've been better.

17:15.481 --> 17:18.780
But if Liquid would've come,
he wouldn't like waiting.

17:20.685 --> 17:22.744
And you?

17:23.388 --> 17:28.416
I've no problem. I wouldn't mind
if you're half-an-hour late.

17:29.628 --> 17:32.825
In that case, it is good
that you came. I'm usually late.

17:32.865 --> 17:36.961
I like to wait. In fact,
it is my favorite time.

17:47.747 --> 17:52.707
Excuse me.
Actually I forgot my swipe card.

17:55.354 --> 17:56.480
Are you new here?

17:56.555 --> 17:57.886
I joined just yesterday.

18:01.427 --> 18:02.689
Thanks.

18:02.728 --> 18:05.219
You need my help.
My name is Nishant Agarwal.

18:05.297 --> 18:07.731
Employee code No. 1578.
Dial 2 for my desk phone.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.631
Sure.
- Thanks.

18:09.935 --> 18:10.993
Cheap guy.

18:11.270 --> 18:15.001
What you said? You're wrong.

18:15.608 --> 18:17.940
Thought you need my help and
that's why I told you my name.

18:17.977 --> 18:19.376
I know that I'm cheap.

18:19.445 --> 18:21.242
This is because I never had
any girlfriend in my life.

18:21.313 --> 18:22.644
I never had friendship
with the girls.

18:22.715 --> 18:24.546
I have less experience with them.

18:24.617 --> 18:28.519
In fact, very less. I agree that
I wish to have a girlfriend.

18:28.587 --> 18:31.556
But right now,
I was just trying to help you.

18:31.624 --> 18:32.716
The truth is that.

18:32.758 --> 18:36.717
I don't know how to entice a girl.
Nor have the courage to do it.

18:37.430 --> 18:39.523
I'm not cheap but I look like one.

18:40.032 --> 18:41.761
And generally,
I don't help anybody.

18:41.834 --> 18:42.926
I helped you because
there are very less people..

18:43.002 --> 18:45.630
..in the office since today's Sunday.
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

18:45.805 --> 18:47.033
She calls me a cheap guy.

18:48.841 --> 18:51.275
Chotu, one potato
stuffed rolled bread.

18:52.511 --> 18:53.876
Give me two.

18:55.481 --> 18:56.641
Two.

19:00.519 --> 19:04.853
I am sorry. I'm new and
a little extra conscious.

19:05.391 --> 19:06.619
I'm really sorry.

19:07.593 --> 19:08.651
It is okay.

19:08.694 --> 19:11.959
Shall we start once again?
Hi, I am Charu.

19:13.432 --> 19:14.558
Nishant.

19:26.779 --> 19:28.303
Don't you think the potato
stuffed rolled bread is uncooked?

19:28.681 --> 19:29.841
He is an idiot.

19:34.019 --> 19:38.353
Brother Chotu,
please give us another one.

19:50.636 --> 19:51.933
Choudhary.

19:54.874 --> 19:57.399
''There's wild..''
- Sweet.

20:02.648 --> 20:06.744
What is the matter?
My dear lion, you are here now.

20:07.853 --> 20:10.287
What's going on? Sweet?

20:18.831 --> 20:19.889
What happened?

20:19.932 --> 20:22.594
What will happen?
The boy fell in love.

20:22.835 --> 20:27.704
What is the matter,
Rajjo? His skin is glowing.

20:29.008 --> 20:31.476
How was your Sunday?

20:31.744 --> 20:35.339
Great. Today you cannot even imagine
what happen with your brother.

20:35.414 --> 20:36.745
Did you get fired from your job?

20:38.384 --> 20:39.442
What happened?

20:40.619 --> 20:42.780
Today, a girl came and
spoke to your brother.

20:42.855 --> 20:44.550
She even had potato
stuffed rolled bread with me.

20:45.424 --> 20:47.984
Did you check? Was she a girl?

20:48.060 --> 20:49.823
What you mean? She was girl.

20:50.029 --> 20:51.860
But how did this miracle happen?

20:52.364 --> 20:53.888
She is new in the office.

20:54.033 --> 20:57.025
She mistook that I was trying to
entice her since I helped her.

20:57.102 --> 20:58.694
I yelled at her.

20:58.771 --> 21:02.764
I went out in the evening.
She met me there and apologized.

21:03.442 --> 21:06.002
You know my nature. I forgave her.

21:06.612 --> 21:08.876
Great, Liquid. You got it.

21:09.882 --> 21:13.750
No. She's a decent girl.

21:13.819 --> 21:15.844
One doesn't become friend by
having one square meal together.

21:15.921 --> 21:17.013
What are you talking?

21:17.289 --> 21:19.757
He made a family
planning on his very first date.

21:20.326 --> 21:21.850
You're doing great.

21:21.927 --> 21:23.758
You people.

21:28.934 --> 21:30.060
Tell me quickly.

21:30.336 --> 21:32.566
Choudhary, Neha hasn't called yet.

21:32.805 --> 21:34.466
So, what can I do?

21:34.673 --> 21:36.436
Shall I call her?

21:36.508 --> 21:39.375
Go ahead. Don't ask. Call her.

21:44.683 --> 21:45.707
Tell me.

21:45.818 --> 21:50.050
Hello Choudhary, there is a new gym
in which boys and girls go together.

21:50.422 --> 21:52.549
Liquid, I'm busy with some
urgent work. Call me later.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.752
Now, disconnect the phone.
- Okay, I love you too. Bye.

21:58.530 --> 22:01.795
If she calls then
I shall ask her for a date.

22:02.434 --> 22:03.799
Will it sound too desperate?

22:03.869 --> 22:05.928
You are desperate Ranjat.
And she knows it.

22:06.005 --> 22:08.530
Do as you wish. It's not
going to make difference.

22:13.479 --> 22:16.846
Choudhary, there is one
more idea. Let's learn Salsa.

22:16.915 --> 22:18.382
Liquid, I am busy.

22:18.450 --> 22:20.008
Come on.

22:24.923 --> 22:26.447
What's the matter with you?

22:26.492 --> 22:28.426
I'm asking you not to call.
Don't you understand?

22:29.995 --> 22:32.964
I am very sorry. Actually,
thought it was someone else.

22:33.732 --> 22:36.667
Great. What time?

22:37.302 --> 22:39.532
Cool. I'll be there for sure.

22:59.692 --> 23:02.252
What is this?
What are you doing here?

23:02.327 --> 23:04.488
Varun, please, don't start now.

23:04.697 --> 23:05.994
Varun, please.

23:13.906 --> 23:15.669
Hi, congratulations.

23:15.908 --> 23:17.773
If I eat more,
then I will become fat.

23:17.843 --> 23:19.902
What are you talking?
You look great.

23:20.479 --> 23:22.640
Well, talk to Varun about it.

23:25.851 --> 23:27.751
Vikrant?
- Yeah.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.420
Hi, Riya.
- Hi.

23:30.489 --> 23:31.854
Thanks for recommending me.

23:31.924 --> 23:33.016
Thanks for what?

23:33.292 --> 23:35.624
Through a friend I recommended you,
so I'll get bonus from him.

23:35.694 --> 23:37.628
I'll get my new blackberry.

23:38.697 --> 23:39.857
What will you have?

23:47.606 --> 23:49.039
What do I say now?

23:49.908 --> 23:53.639
Let's have the tried and tested
forced boring formal conversation.

23:53.879 --> 23:56.712
So, Riya?
Which college are you from?

23:57.883 --> 23:59.544
Delhi college of engineering.

23:59.952 --> 24:01.419
Delhi college of engineering.

24:01.487 --> 24:02.818
One of my friend was also
in the same college. - Really?

24:02.888 --> 24:05.379
Which batch?
- 2007.

24:05.858 --> 24:09.760
Perhaps he was in 2006.
You know him.

24:09.828 --> 24:11.261
Which branch?

24:11.530 --> 24:13.361
You have not seen the CV?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.992
If that is the logic,
then how can we talk?

24:18.837 --> 24:20.771
True.
- You are looking beautiful.

24:21.273 --> 24:23.434
Especially with your sweet smile.

24:27.613 --> 24:30.411
Eat less chocolates and
take don't put on weight.

24:30.783 --> 24:32.876
Eat small meats at small duration.

24:33.051 --> 24:34.848
Drink lots of water.
- Okay.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.512
Your skin will improve.

24:36.588 --> 24:38.818
Drink bottle gourd
juice early in the morning.

24:38.891 --> 24:41.359
Oh no.. bottle gourd? Never.

24:41.426 --> 24:43.018
You have to lose weight too.

24:43.295 --> 24:45.855
It's not about eating.
It is about eating right.

24:56.975 --> 24:59.808
The flat is so nice
and I really loved it.

25:00.579 --> 25:01.739
Then finalize it.

25:01.980 --> 25:04.414
The deposit is fifty
thousand above our budget.

25:04.983 --> 25:07.417
I see.. Then you do one thing.

25:07.486 --> 25:10.649
I have fifty. You take it
and you return it to me later.

25:10.756 --> 25:12.018
No, Nishant. How can I?

25:12.257 --> 25:14.020
What is the problem?
I got it now.

25:14.293 --> 25:16.784
Nishant, I am exactly
troubling you a lot.

25:16.862 --> 25:18.591
Yes, how it is?

25:18.664 --> 25:19.995
It is good.

25:20.265 --> 25:21.562
Okay then. Done?

25:21.700 --> 25:24.965
I have one more client,
so you have to pay deposit early.

25:25.304 --> 25:28.467
No, no. You will get the deposit
and brokerage by tomorrow.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.337
Then, its okay. Yes, brother..

25:30.409 --> 25:31.740
Will I get it by tomorrow?

25:31.777 --> 25:34.371
Yes, no problem. You will get it.
- Sure? - Yes.

25:34.446 --> 25:36.038
Shall we leave?
- Thanks.

25:48.961 --> 25:51.327
How is it going on?

25:51.897 --> 25:53.057
Not bad.

25:58.804 --> 26:00.704
This is called officially
approved GA.

26:02.541 --> 26:03.667
GA?

26:03.909 --> 26:05.501
Groping allowance.

26:06.712 --> 26:08.907
You men are very wicked.

26:09.648 --> 26:11.878
Don't blame us.
Everyone knows how it is.

26:11.950 --> 26:13.781
Blame the one who's responsible.

26:14.453 --> 26:15.647
Point.

26:16.521 --> 26:18.648
Are you done for the day
or anything remains?

26:19.791 --> 26:22.692
The work is finished.
Heading home now.

26:24.296 --> 26:25.354
Where do you stay?

26:25.430 --> 26:26.658
Southex.

26:28.300 --> 26:29.494
How will you go?

26:30.002 --> 26:31.264
Auto.

26:31.336 --> 26:32.963
Come I'll drop you.

26:33.872 --> 26:35.499
Is it on your way?

26:35.641 --> 26:37.609
There is no much
difference from here too.

26:37.776 --> 26:39.767
No, it is okay. I'll manage.

26:42.814 --> 26:43.940
What happened?

26:45.450 --> 26:47.441
Why should I waste my petrol then?

26:56.762 --> 26:58.525
Give me two popsicles.

27:04.002 --> 27:06.527
Not there, look there.

27:10.342 --> 27:11.775
Your taste is not good.

27:12.844 --> 27:15.745
My taste is very good.

27:36.902 --> 27:41.669
''There's a strange thirst.''

27:45.344 --> 27:51.044
''This is a new feeling.''

27:53.785 --> 28:00.657
''Somebody is coming closer.''

28:02.527 --> 28:11.925
''Somebody is coming closer.''

28:12.971 --> 28:19.535
''There's a strange thirst.''

28:46.805 --> 28:53.540
''Every morning is velvety.''

28:55.614 --> 29:02.315
''Every night is exotic.''

29:03.722 --> 29:07.715
''Every morning is velvety.''

29:08.393 --> 29:12.420
''Every night is exotic.''

29:12.631 --> 29:22.404
''Every day is like a rose
and every night is in slumber.''

29:22.841 --> 29:27.369
''There's something special
about her.''

29:27.446 --> 29:35.319
''She is like a dream come true.''

29:35.954 --> 29:45.329
''Somebody is coming closer.''

29:46.665 --> 29:55.471
''There's a strange thirst.''

30:12.724 --> 30:16.387
''I smile when I am with her.''

30:16.828 --> 30:20.491
''I am happy when I am with her.''

30:20.899 --> 30:29.671
''I am lost in her colors.''

30:29.741 --> 30:33.871
''I smile when I am with her.''

30:33.945 --> 30:38.314
''I am happy when I am with her.''

30:38.383 --> 30:46.017
''I am lost in her colors.''

30:46.324 --> 30:50.317
''This is a beautiful ambience.''

30:50.562 --> 30:54.726
''This is the house of happiness.''

30:56.835 --> 31:04.537
''She's my devotion.
She's my desire.''

31:05.410 --> 31:12.407
''Somebody is coming closer.''

31:13.785 --> 31:20.850
''There's a strange thirst.''

31:22.394 --> 31:29.891
''This is a new feeling.''

31:41.546 --> 31:42.808
Hi.
- Hi.

31:43.782 --> 31:44.942
Carry on.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.481
If I didn't want to do your work..

31:50.555 --> 31:52.682
..I wouldn't have stayed
back in the office till ten.

31:52.857 --> 31:54.347
I did it.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.318
I am not proving it to you..

31:57.395 --> 32:02.355
..I am telling you that
I was very busy so, I came late.

32:02.901 --> 32:07.031
Would I like if that idiotic
manager tells you anything?

32:09.975 --> 32:13.775
Okay. I am sorry. I am sorry.

32:14.412 --> 32:16.880
Sure. Okay, bye.

32:17.048 --> 32:19.414
Okay, take care.

32:20.752 --> 32:22.720
In which language are you talking?

32:22.988 --> 32:24.751
I never heard this
from you earlier.

32:24.823 --> 32:29.055
See, Charu had told me to do
some urgent work in the office.

32:29.794 --> 32:31.887
I did a little late. So,
that poor girl..

32:32.597 --> 32:34.690
You did her work and now
listen to her abuses too.

32:35.033 --> 32:37.058
What's wrong with this house?

32:38.703 --> 32:40.432
Did you talk to Rajat?

32:41.039 --> 32:44.304
See, it is your idea and
you will talk to Rajjo..

32:44.376 --> 32:46.936
..and I don't have
any such problems.

32:47.345 --> 32:51.805
Yes, the bugs will bite
and she will clean the bed.

32:53.084 --> 32:56.451
Even, I don't have any problem.

32:56.521 --> 32:57.579
Being around make it difficult.

32:57.656 --> 32:58.918
She's with us at home
and even when we go out.

32:58.990 --> 33:01.254
She makes some plans
and we have to obey it.

33:01.426 --> 33:02.791
This is not done.

33:02.861 --> 33:05.853
I am sorry, Vikrant.
I am sorry, Nishant..

33:06.398 --> 33:08.730
..because of me you
people are being troubled.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.028
Neha this is not
what I meant to say.

33:10.302 --> 33:14.568
I know that because of me,
you don't have enough of space.

33:14.839 --> 33:17.933
You are uncomfortable
because of me.

33:18.677 --> 33:22.340
I came here because you guys are
important part of my life now..

33:22.547 --> 33:25.015
..and I don't want that you
become only Rajat's friend.

33:25.283 --> 33:28.719
I am trying to make you guys a part
of my life.. and be a part of yours.

33:29.988 --> 33:34.288
I thought, I am not only Rajat's
girlfriend, I am your friend too.

33:34.426 --> 33:36.792
Neha, you are. What happened?

33:37.028 --> 33:41.055
Daily he says, let's meet out
because you don't get space at home.

33:41.333 --> 33:42.561
You sully girl!

33:44.002 --> 33:47.904
You are so wicked!
I am talking to you.

33:51.876 --> 33:54.777
Your wet underwear is lying in
the bathroom since three days.

33:54.813 --> 33:57.043
You've made egg shells
as ashtray in the kitchen.

33:57.315 --> 33:59.909
Choudhary has puked thrice
because of your smelling socks.

33:59.984 --> 34:02.418
You tell Neha that
she's troubling us?

34:03.755 --> 34:06.815
She's such a sweet kid.
You are the problem.

34:09.027 --> 34:12.428
Neha, you don't listen to him.
Choudhary will teach him a lesson..

34:12.464 --> 34:14.295
Choudhary, give him a tight slap.

34:14.599 --> 34:17.397
Since Vikrant returned home,
he's told me five times..

34:17.469 --> 34:19.733
..let's go out and
I'll drop you home from there.

34:19.804 --> 34:22.967
If you have so much problem because
of me, tell me. I'll not come here.

34:23.041 --> 34:27.306
He's mad?
Rajat, are you out of your mind?

34:30.648 --> 34:31.774
Will you have ice-cream?

34:33.650 --> 34:34.743
Will you have?

34:37.054 --> 34:38.886
You go and bring the ice-cream.

34:40.725 --> 34:43.694
Don't stand here. Go!
- Let's all go together.

34:45.830 --> 34:46.956
Okay.

34:50.869 --> 34:52.803
Are they buying
ice-cream or freezing it?

34:53.004 --> 34:55.029
What was the need to
tell all these things?

34:56.608 --> 35:00.476
See, you people don't say anything,
but then there is problem.

35:00.745 --> 35:02.269
I don't go to her place because..

35:02.347 --> 35:04.611
..I don't want her roommates
to feel uncomfortable.

35:05.950 --> 35:09.477
Look, ask Neha to take a small
apartment and shift somewhere near.

35:09.554 --> 35:11.579
When they will stay together
then you will not have problem..

35:11.656 --> 35:13.487
..and even you can
spend time together.

35:14.292 --> 35:15.782
This is actually not a good idea.

35:16.661 --> 35:18.253
Bye.

35:24.669 --> 35:26.500
You know what..

35:26.571 --> 35:29.938
We need space for us too..
to spend some time together.

35:30.408 --> 35:32.899
Actually yes.. let's take a house.

35:32.977 --> 35:34.569
Nearby this complex.

35:34.646 --> 35:35.874
This will be so exciting.

35:35.914 --> 35:37.381
If you come in this area..

35:37.449 --> 35:39.383
..then you wont miss
the fun which all four us have.

35:39.417 --> 35:40.785
I won't miss you and
we'll always be together.

35:40.785 --> 35:43.447
Then I will daily
drop you to the office.

35:43.788 --> 35:46.689
But there's a problem.
If my mom and dad learns that..

35:46.758 --> 35:48.020
..I am staying
in living relationship..

35:48.293 --> 35:49.521
..then they will kill me.

35:51.663 --> 35:54.632
What to do then? Do you
want to drop this plan?

35:54.699 --> 35:57.532
No, I will handle it.

36:11.950 --> 36:13.417
This is right.

36:13.985 --> 36:15.247
Yes.

36:15.286 --> 36:16.947
Choudhary and I was discussing
about this yesterday..

36:18.857 --> 36:20.791
I hope you've thought
about it clearly?

36:21.025 --> 36:23.493
Isn't it a bit risky?

36:24.863 --> 36:27.593
I also felt the same
whether this is right or wrong.

36:27.999 --> 36:30.729
But don't know why,
I felt everything will be alright.

36:31.903 --> 36:33.495
I think, it is a little early.

36:33.905 --> 36:37.432
By the way, we are together
for more than six months now.

36:38.443 --> 36:40.741
You know this is my
first relationship.

36:41.412 --> 36:43.346
I feel, I should have
someone with me now.

36:43.715 --> 36:47.617
When I am with her, I feel,
it is so easy to be happy.

36:48.419 --> 36:52.617
After a tiring day in the office,
when she hugs me in the evening..

36:52.790 --> 36:54.553
..I become very happy.

36:55.293 --> 36:56.726
I used to pass days..

36:56.794 --> 36:59.388
..but there was nothing to
look forward to apart from work.

36:59.631 --> 37:01.622
Now, there's an excitement in life.

37:01.733 --> 37:03.928
You know? She makes me feel alive.

37:04.002 --> 37:06.766
Yes, now there is no
excitement in our love.

37:06.838 --> 37:08.772
You wont feel alive with us?

37:09.908 --> 37:11.808
What are you talking?

37:12.744 --> 37:17.579
He is abusing you and telling
that you have snatched me from him.

37:17.715 --> 37:19.706
Why didn't you slap him?

37:19.751 --> 37:21.981
No, I was also doing the same.

37:22.253 --> 37:23.743
What did you say?

37:24.355 --> 37:27.518
I was saying, I've become
very careless because of you.

37:27.859 --> 37:30.384
I'll lose my job because of love.

37:30.461 --> 37:33.430
Am I creating so much problem?

37:33.498 --> 37:36.262
Really?
- Yes.

38:01.693 --> 38:02.853
What are you thinking?

38:05.330 --> 38:09.357
Charu, you know life
is very difficult.

38:09.734 --> 38:11.429
You know, everyone fights
with their lives.

38:11.502 --> 38:12.730
You have seen,
we had to fight to find a house.

38:12.937 --> 38:15.303
I know. So, what now?

38:15.940 --> 38:19.740
We have to stop fighting with
life now. We have to make life easy.

38:20.678 --> 38:21.940
Do you get my point?

38:22.747 --> 38:24.578
Did your PM tell you anything

38:24.616 --> 38:26.743
How will she dare to
say anything to me?

38:26.784 --> 38:29.252
You just concentrate on what I say.

38:29.854 --> 38:35.918
Look, what I am saying is..
our office is like a hell..

38:36.494 --> 38:39.395
..but we can make our life easier
outside this office, isn't it?

38:41.399 --> 38:42.593
Okay, look..

38:43.768 --> 38:47.329
I am telling you,
there should be somebody..

38:47.639 --> 38:50.631
..when you return home tired
after a busy day at the office..

38:50.708 --> 38:52.266
..someone who hugs you lovingly.

38:52.343 --> 38:53.776
You will feel that
everything is beautiful.

38:53.845 --> 38:57.781
No matter how bad your
day was and life is..

38:57.815 --> 39:00.283
..it should feel as
though everything is alright.

39:00.618 --> 39:02.449
It shouldn't be such that
you spend the whole day..

39:02.520 --> 39:04.249
..and there's no fun in your life.

39:05.456 --> 39:08.550
I mean, you know.. there should be
some excitement in life.

39:09.727 --> 39:12.389
I mean, someone who
makes you feel alive.

39:12.764 --> 39:14.254
I am so lively.

39:14.932 --> 39:17.298
Charu, are you understanding
what I am trying to say?

39:19.303 --> 39:20.429
Okay. Okay.

39:25.643 --> 39:26.871
Charu, I love you.

39:37.288 --> 39:40.655
Charu.. Charu, I am sorry.

39:52.770 --> 39:56.672
You know Vicky, Varun does
not respect my feelings.

39:57.542 --> 40:00.409
According to him,
I don't know how to talk to people.

40:00.945 --> 40:04.346
He says I am overfriendly
with people.

40:05.383 --> 40:06.509
Am I?

40:07.351 --> 40:10.343
You tell me.
Am I overfriendly with you?

40:10.621 --> 40:12.452
No. You are not.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.598
Hi Nishant, I am sorry.
I couldn't respond back.

40:25.670 --> 40:28.662
I am already in a relationship.
I respect your feelings.

40:28.706 --> 40:31.504
But really can't do anything about
it. I am sure you'll understand.

40:31.609 --> 40:33.338
I'm sorry I have to do this to you.

40:37.582 --> 40:39.311
I just want to be myself.

40:39.617 --> 40:42.711
I want to live and
laugh the way I like.

40:43.054 --> 40:45.921
I can talk to anyone
as much as I want.

40:46.691 --> 40:48.420
I just want my space.

41:02.807 --> 41:04.434
I love him, Vikrant.

41:05.276 --> 41:08.268
I am missing him very,
very badly. I know that.

41:08.980 --> 41:13.849
But I know that if I live with him,
neither he'll be happy nor I.

41:15.753 --> 41:17.653
So, I have to do this.

41:18.723 --> 41:21.351
For his happiness and for mine.

41:23.594 --> 41:25.494
I just want to be happy.

41:25.763 --> 41:27.731
Am I wishing something wrong?

41:28.332 --> 41:30.596
No, not at all.

41:33.971 --> 41:35.029
Charu, what's wrong with you.

41:35.306 --> 41:36.796
If you are not able to do it,
then just let me know.

41:36.874 --> 41:38.432
I'll give it to someone else.

41:38.576 --> 41:41.568
Sir, I am trying. I'll do it ASAP.

41:49.720 --> 41:50.812
Alone?

42:00.531 --> 42:03.432
I have done your work and have
mailed it to you. You check it.

42:05.336 --> 42:07.531
Nishant, I don't want your sympathy.

42:07.805 --> 42:08.897
It is not sympathy, Charu.

42:08.973 --> 42:11.999
Have you come here to say
that you've done favor on me?

42:12.543 --> 42:15.307
I won't talk to you,
but will do my work?

42:16.414 --> 42:20.043
Nishant I took you as a friend
so I was relying on you..

42:20.918 --> 42:22.977
..but you don't want my friendship.

42:24.355 --> 42:26.687
Charu.
- Because I have a boyfriend..

42:26.757 --> 42:28.748
..so, you will not talk to me.

42:30.895 --> 42:32.795
Charu, one second. Please.

42:33.497 --> 42:36.830
See.. I am sorry. I am really sorry.

42:37.501 --> 42:40.834
I did a mistake by proposing you.

42:41.572 --> 42:44.439
I really didn't know how
to face you. I am sorry.

42:44.642 --> 42:46.837
I am your friend.

42:48.079 --> 42:49.410
Sure?

42:49.881 --> 42:51.075
How I should assure you, tell me?

42:51.349 --> 42:52.509
You assure me later..

42:52.583 --> 42:54.983
..I'll first sent the
mail that you've sent me.

42:55.887 --> 42:57.081
Bye.

43:05.596 --> 43:07.587
You know, Vicky.

43:11.369 --> 43:12.996
You understand me.

43:35.493 --> 43:38.792
Wow! Choudhary, today you
are playing very nicely.

43:39.463 --> 43:40.555
What is the matter?

43:40.631 --> 43:42.929
You may play with heart
or by finger.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.699
What is important? Playing it.
- Wow! Rajjo!

43:49.573 --> 43:51.871
Choudhary, are you blushing?

43:57.048 --> 43:58.743
Thanks for bringing me here.

44:02.620 --> 44:03.848
You know what?

44:04.989 --> 44:06.513
I miss Abhi.

44:10.995 --> 44:12.826
You've made this drink very strong.

44:14.799 --> 44:16.767
Choudhary, play it.

44:17.535 --> 44:18.729
Come.

44:19.837 --> 44:22.328
Riya, move aside.
Move aside. Right away.

44:22.406 --> 44:23.532
No.

44:43.995 --> 44:45.986
After long time,
this was so much fun..

44:48.933 --> 44:51.561
Listen, tomorrow I am going to
Choudhary and Liquid's house..

44:51.635 --> 44:52.932
..to see the match.

44:53.504 --> 44:55.734
Tomorrow we were supposed to go
and purchase the household items.

44:56.307 --> 44:57.604
We will go after the match.

45:08.786 --> 45:11.414
Babu.

45:11.789 --> 45:13.256
I am sleepy.

45:23.267 --> 45:24.359
Good morning.

45:32.710 --> 45:34.507
Today you woke up so early.

45:35.312 --> 45:38.713
I don't sleep more and I
like to stay in my senses.

45:40.384 --> 45:41.544
Why do you drink so much?

45:41.619 --> 45:46.283
How much? I would've
just had two pegs yesterday.

45:47.391 --> 45:50.326
I am talking about yesterday..
I am talking about this.

45:53.998 --> 45:55.625
Is this the way you drink?

45:56.534 --> 46:00.630
Who is such an educated sensible
man who does not know his limit.

46:00.671 --> 46:03.333
I am so disappointed.
Actually, I am disgusted, Rajat.

46:03.407 --> 46:07.571
Neha, this is very old. It was
taken when we had not even met.

46:07.645 --> 46:10.739
What difference does that make?
It is yours, isn't it?

46:11.515 --> 46:13.449
That's not the point anyway, Rajat.

46:13.684 --> 46:15.618
What is the point, Neha?

46:15.686 --> 46:17.711
The point is you are like this.

46:19.390 --> 46:20.721
Neha, how I am?

46:21.792 --> 46:23.760
If you don't understand
your mistake..

46:23.828 --> 46:25.625
..then I don't want to
make you understand.

46:26.397 --> 46:27.557
Neha.

46:30.734 --> 46:31.996
What is this nonsense?

46:32.303 --> 46:33.702
I'd told you that day itself..

46:33.771 --> 46:35.363
..now click one more picture
and paste it.

46:35.573 --> 46:37.302
What nonsense are you talking?

46:37.575 --> 46:40.510
She is talking like a fool and
you are also telling the same thing.

46:40.711 --> 46:41.905
But why discuss about
this all of a sudden?

46:42.012 --> 46:43.309
I don't know.

46:44.048 --> 46:47.279
Rajjo, you look gorgeous even today.

46:47.785 --> 46:51.380
Whenever I see it,
I get ill-intentions.

46:51.455 --> 46:53.286
Shut up, Liquid.
- You shut up.

46:53.491 --> 46:54.617
What is this matter now?

46:54.692 --> 46:57.058
Yesterday your madam suffered from
motions after eating in an inn..

46:57.328 --> 46:59.057
..did we tell that she
doesn't know to eat?

46:59.330 --> 47:00.957
She herself said the food was bad.

47:01.232 --> 47:03.564
The food was bad,
can't the drink be bad?

47:03.701 --> 47:04.929
Does she mean to say,
if anyone suffers from diarrhea..

47:05.002 --> 47:06.560
..they shouldn't eat food at all.

47:06.637 --> 47:08.628
And since when it is
making difference to you?

47:08.739 --> 47:11.367
You've always puked in the inns.

47:11.442 --> 47:12.773
This was placed here..

47:12.843 --> 47:15.277
..as you were finding it
difficult on an Indian style.

47:15.479 --> 47:17.913
See it is not bad to
vomit after drinking.

47:17.982 --> 47:20.678
It is wrong to make an issue.
Right Liquid? - Right.

47:21.252 --> 47:22.480
And your madam is already insane.

47:22.553 --> 47:23.884
She makes issue of everything.

47:23.988 --> 47:26.422
Issue? She's making me do thesis?

47:26.490 --> 47:28.651
She lectured me so much and
spoilt my mood early in the morning.

47:28.759 --> 47:29.851
Yes, Rajjo.

47:29.960 --> 47:33.418
Life become easy.
She makes you feel alive?

47:38.469 --> 47:41.734
I am sorry. I think I rushed into
the decision of living together.

47:41.805 --> 47:43.773
It is my fault.
I'll sort it out myself.

47:58.589 --> 48:00.056
India will lose today.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.854
Babu is sweeping?

48:07.731 --> 48:09.596
This is wrong.

48:10.768 --> 48:15.364
This idiot commits a mistake
and makes his beloved sweep?

48:16.373 --> 48:18.841
He'll be beaten today.

48:23.881 --> 48:26.975
..that was beautiful
again Sachin Tendulkar..

48:42.967 --> 48:44.798
Neha, what happened?

48:46.604 --> 48:48.299
Neha, say something.

48:50.608 --> 48:53.304
Sachin would've made
a century by now.

48:54.411 --> 48:55.969
Babu, I love you.

48:58.048 --> 48:59.606
I am sorry.

49:00.985 --> 49:02.543
I love you.

49:14.598 --> 49:15.997
Neha, what happened, tell me?

49:17.635 --> 49:20.604
You know what, Rajat?
It is not going to work out.

49:21.438 --> 49:23.406
I am sure, it is my mistake.

49:23.774 --> 49:26.504
Taking me for granted
and I let you do it.

49:27.011 --> 49:30.344
Your priorities, your hobbies,
your friends, your town.

49:30.948 --> 49:33.348
You are important for yourself.
- No, Babu.

49:33.384 --> 49:35.318
Rajat, relationship
doesn't work like this.

49:35.653 --> 49:37.245
How can you be so selfish?

49:37.821 --> 49:39.288
You think only about yourself.

49:39.723 --> 49:41.315
Since last two weeks
I am telling you..

49:41.392 --> 49:42.450
..to bring the curtains
for the house..

49:42.526 --> 49:43.584
..crockery, and other items.

49:43.661 --> 49:45.026
But you don't care.

49:45.629 --> 49:46.823
You just want to have fun.

49:46.897 --> 49:49.730
Is house hold work
only my responsibility?

50:01.045 --> 50:04.845
We are not yet married and you do
like this. You don't care, Rajat.

50:05.616 --> 50:07.880
Neha you are telling as
if I don't do anything.

50:08.285 --> 50:10.810
I had come with you to
shop for household items.

50:10.921 --> 50:12.582
Since last three weeks
every Saturday and Sunday..

50:12.656 --> 50:13.816
..we are doing the same thing.

50:13.991 --> 50:15.686
Curtains, cushions, cups, plates.

50:15.793 --> 50:18.694
Now, you tell me.. what you told
me to do and what I have not done?

50:20.331 --> 50:23.323
This is the point Rajat.
I always have to tell you to do it.

50:23.500 --> 50:24.990
Why can't you do anything
by yourself?

50:25.536 --> 50:28.767
I don't enjoy all this work, but
I still do it as it is important.

50:29.006 --> 50:31.770
I also can go out with my friends.
We can arrange the house later.

50:32.042 --> 50:33.805
Neha it is not like that.

50:33.877 --> 50:36.778
When I do anything on my own you
tell why did you do like this?

50:36.847 --> 50:40.010
I don't go out daily.
I went after many days today.

50:40.718 --> 50:43.744
Okay Rajat, you cannot
understand your mistake..

50:43.821 --> 50:45.516
..so, I don't want to
argue with you.

50:48.525 --> 50:50.652
You are correct and I am wrong.

50:51.562 --> 50:54.053
I took such a big
step for your happiness.

50:54.465 --> 50:55.659
I moved in.

50:55.699 --> 50:57.667
I lied to my parents,
but who cares.

50:57.735 --> 50:58.997
It is my fault.

50:59.069 --> 51:00.696
No Babu, I care.

51:00.871 --> 51:02.896
No Rajat, you don't.

51:03.540 --> 51:05.974
You only want to be with
your friends and watch cricket.

51:06.510 --> 51:10.970
Then why don't you live with Sachin?
I am nothing to you.

51:11.682 --> 51:13.980
When everything is finished,
you remember me in the night.

51:14.752 --> 51:16.743
Is this my importance for you?

51:26.897 --> 51:28.865
Hi. How are you?

51:29.633 --> 51:31.066
You remembered me
after a long time?

51:31.702 --> 51:33.067
I was just sitting.

51:34.538 --> 51:37.439
Yes. When do we go?
Sure. Let's go.

51:38.475 --> 51:41.535
Forget Riya. She overacts.

51:42.079 --> 51:43.512
You tell me, when do we go?

51:44.548 --> 51:47.312
Seriously? Okay, done. See you.

51:47.384 --> 51:48.908
Bye Charu. Bye.

51:51.855 --> 51:53.345
What were we discussing?

51:55.058 --> 52:00.690
Forget it, Babu. Leave it.
You know I love you.

52:00.864 --> 52:02.354
No Rajat. I don't.

52:03.634 --> 52:05.431
You know, this is your problem.

52:05.636 --> 52:07.399
You don't want to
discuss the problems.

52:07.471 --> 52:08.699
You want to run away
from the problem.

52:09.573 --> 52:11.939
Do you even remember
when did you last speak to me?

52:12.543 --> 52:14.374
You have no interest
in talking to me.

52:14.912 --> 52:17.642
You have time
for Nishant and Vicky.

52:18.048 --> 52:19.379
For me?

52:20.484 --> 52:23.044
I ask you daily about
how was your day, don't I?

52:23.454 --> 52:24.819
Have you ever asked me?

52:25.823 --> 52:27.688
You never talk, Rajat.

52:28.959 --> 52:31.894
I am sorry, Babu.

52:32.429 --> 52:36.661
We'll surely take time out
for each other and talk.

52:37.301 --> 52:39.599
See, this is the difference.

52:40.771 --> 52:42.796
You'll have to take time out for me.

52:42.873 --> 52:44.841
I think about taking
time out for other things..

52:44.908 --> 52:47.001
..because I give
all my time to you.

52:49.546 --> 52:51.377
Sorry. This will not happen again.

52:52.349 --> 52:54.340
I hope you are not telling this
just for the sake of telling.

52:54.418 --> 52:55.942
Rajat, if this happens again..

52:59.623 --> 53:00.817
No, it will not happen.

53:00.891 --> 53:04.725
I am very serious, Rajat.
If this happen again, you know..

53:04.795 --> 53:07.025
I know, Babu. I love you.

53:19.409 --> 53:21.070
Catch it!

53:34.525 --> 53:37.688
Didn't I tell you, I hate it?
Don't wear this.

53:38.061 --> 53:41.292
No Babu, you said.
You don't like it too much.

53:41.398 --> 53:42.797
You, Babu..

53:42.833 --> 53:45.393
You know, Rajat. You have this habit
of putting words in my mouth.

53:45.636 --> 53:47.763
Then you try to manipulate me.

53:49.072 --> 53:51.597
Neha, what are you telling?

53:52.643 --> 53:54.042
You know I hate this shirt, Rajat.

53:54.311 --> 53:57.337
When I said I don't like it.
I very clearly meant that I hate it.

53:57.548 --> 53:58.708
Still you want to wear it.

53:58.916 --> 54:00.508
Okay. Wear it.

54:00.851 --> 54:03.581
What difference will my choice
make to you? Right?

54:03.820 --> 54:06.414
Now that I am living with you
don't have to entice me anymore.

54:06.757 --> 54:07.849
Do what you like.

54:09.726 --> 54:11.023
Is this okay, Babu?

54:14.831 --> 54:19.029
''I am in love.''

54:19.303 --> 54:24.434
''I am in pain
after falling in love.''

54:28.278 --> 54:29.370
How it is?

54:30.814 --> 54:32.714
Salt is less, isn't it?

54:35.819 --> 54:36.945
Babu?

54:40.490 --> 54:42.981
Babu, where did you learn
to make such good coffee?

54:43.060 --> 54:45.358
I mean, you should go and tell
these stupid coffee chains..

54:45.429 --> 54:47.056
..that this how a coffee is made.

54:50.667 --> 54:52.498
Sonam looks gorgeous, isn't it?

55:06.483 --> 55:08.781
Babu? Babu, listen.

55:09.620 --> 55:13.351
Babu I was not looking at her.
I didn't see that girl.

55:16.560 --> 55:19.688
Sister Shuba.. Aarti's cousin,
who stays in Southex..

55:20.030 --> 55:22.430
..her neighbor's sister-in-law..
- Who?

55:22.733 --> 55:24.530
Sister Shubha, Aarti's cousin..

55:24.601 --> 55:27.502
..is having the affair till
today with her college boyfriend.

55:27.838 --> 55:29.863
Do you believe it?
- Is he a gay?

55:31.008 --> 55:33.841
God, not him.. I swear..

55:33.910 --> 55:36.572
Her blouse has
cleave all till her waist.

55:36.647 --> 55:37.841
Is she nice?

55:39.416 --> 55:41.281
Her husband doesn't
even look at her.

55:42.319 --> 55:46.449
''I am in love.''

55:46.523 --> 55:52.052
''I am in pain
after falling in love.''

55:59.770 --> 56:00.862
Babu?

56:03.440 --> 56:06.000
Rajat, this is not the way to talk.
Go and die somewhere.

56:14.651 --> 56:18.212
Happy birthday to you.

56:20.590 --> 56:24.287
Happy birthday to you.

56:24.361 --> 56:27.819
Happy birthday, Dear Riya.

56:28.432 --> 56:32.960
Happy birthday to you.

56:33.503 --> 56:34.936
Thank you, Vikrant.

56:35.005 --> 56:39.339
You are thanking me in such a way,
as though you have grown old.

56:40.544 --> 56:43.513
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

56:43.647 --> 56:46.639
You don't have to work
hard today. Happy birthday.

56:47.751 --> 56:52.848
Actually, since last five years
only Varun used to call me first.

56:54.558 --> 56:57.391
You know, my first
birthday after we started dating.

56:58.028 --> 57:00.428
He came to my office at midnight.

57:00.697 --> 57:02.756
With some 20 bouquets.

57:03.734 --> 57:05.531
Then it started to rain.

57:06.436 --> 57:09.530
When we reached home,
we were completely drenched.

57:10.373 --> 57:11.772
And then we kissed.

57:13.243 --> 57:16.610
I am sorry. I don't know why
am I telling you all this?

57:16.880 --> 57:18.313
I can understand.

57:18.849 --> 57:21.374
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

57:21.685 --> 57:23.710
Bye. Good night.

57:31.394 --> 57:33.487
I am troubling you, isn't it?
- No way.

57:33.864 --> 57:35.491
Not at all.
- Hi.

57:36.333 --> 57:40.736
Hi, how is it and where is it?
- Hi Nishant.

57:41.705 --> 57:42.967
What happened to you?

57:43.440 --> 57:45.431
First you offer me a coffee
then I'll tell you.

57:45.776 --> 57:47.300
Get it for me, please.

57:50.013 --> 57:52.880
See this. It is done.
- Nice.

58:00.891 --> 58:01.983
Coffee.

58:02.826 --> 58:04.259
Thanks.

58:17.507 --> 58:19.566
Charu, this attitude
doesn't suit you.

58:20.577 --> 58:23.808
Do you have any idea how to
talk and how much to talk?

58:24.681 --> 58:26.012
What?

58:27.017 --> 58:29.577
People try to take advantage of
you as you are alone.

58:29.653 --> 58:31.245
You don't understand this.

58:31.588 --> 58:34.557
Why do you allow anyone to
keep their hand on your shoulder?

58:34.958 --> 58:37.449
Even you place your hand on
my shoulder sometimes, isn't it?

58:40.630 --> 58:42.564
So, you are
comparing me to those people?

58:43.266 --> 58:45.962
Yes, what's the difference
between you and them?

58:46.636 --> 58:50.265
The difference is that I..
- What?

58:51.541 --> 58:52.599
I am just telling you..

58:52.676 --> 58:54.906
..maintain distance from people
like this in future.

58:56.580 --> 59:00.482
Nishant, I need not learn from
you how to behave with anyone.

59:00.550 --> 59:02.245
Yes, I saw that.

59:02.586 --> 59:04.281
Even Abhi doesn't
talk to me like this.

59:04.354 --> 59:05.912
Charu, I am not Abhi.

59:06.723 --> 59:08.213
Who are you?

59:20.237 --> 59:21.704
Not going home today?

59:25.475 --> 59:26.806
I will do whatever I like.

59:26.877 --> 59:29.607
You don't need to tell me
what to do and what not to do.

59:32.282 --> 59:34.807
Nishant, do you know,
I over expect from you?

59:35.685 --> 59:38.848
It is true that
you don't understand me.

59:44.761 --> 59:46.251
What happened?

59:46.696 --> 59:47.856
Nothing.

59:59.509 --> 01:00:03.741
I am sorry. I think, I..
- No.. I am sorry.

01:00:09.319 --> 01:00:10.513
What happened to you?

01:00:13.356 --> 01:00:15.483
Abhi fought me
in the morning today.

01:00:15.759 --> 01:00:18.626
He wants me to shift
back to Hydrabad?

01:00:18.695 --> 01:00:20.720
As if I can't take my decision..

01:00:21.464 --> 01:00:25.457
I was trying to relax
since morning you started.

01:00:33.743 --> 01:00:38.407
See, I am sorry, it is not like
that I don't understand anything.

01:00:38.715 --> 01:00:41.445
I understand and that is
why I don't feel bad.

01:00:41.818 --> 01:00:43.843
Nishant, you are
the only friend I have.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.548
What will I do
if you don't understand me?

01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:52.755
I am sorry.

01:00:54.431 --> 01:00:58.629
Shall I hold my ears? Sorry.

01:01:02.339 --> 01:01:03.567
Riya.

01:01:07.811 --> 01:01:12.612
''Come, darling.''

01:01:17.787 --> 01:01:26.820
''I'll take you to the place
where you'll enjoy it.''

01:01:27.764 --> 01:01:30.961
Oh no. We are late.
I'll get ready in a jiffy.

01:01:31.735 --> 01:01:33.999
Don't worry.
Dessert after dinner.

01:02:50.814 --> 01:02:52.304
What's this?

01:03:20.477 --> 01:03:21.774
Riya, forget it.

01:03:21.811 --> 01:03:24.803
If he's acting immature,
why are you doing the same thing?

01:03:24.848 --> 01:03:27.715
No Vikrant, I have to do this.

01:03:29.452 --> 01:03:31.420
I don't understand what
difference will it make?

01:03:33.022 --> 01:03:35.286
You are coming with me
or shall I go alone?

01:03:42.932 --> 01:03:45.457
You stay here.
I want to do this alone.

01:03:52.308 --> 01:03:53.536
Greetings, madam.

01:04:01.451 --> 01:04:03.749
Where do you want to go?
- Nowhere.

01:04:03.987 --> 01:04:05.420
Then why are you sitting here?

01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:07.620
I am waiting for someone.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:09.749
The madam who just went,
is she your girlfriend?

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.318
Yes.

01:04:11.394 --> 01:04:12.884
Madam comes here very often..

01:04:12.962 --> 01:04:14.725
..but I am seeing you
here for the first time.

01:04:15.265 --> 01:04:20.703
Today she came after long time to
meet him who lives in room no. 712.

01:04:20.737 --> 01:04:22.568
It will take some time.
You may go now.

01:04:32.415 --> 01:04:33.541
Goodnight ma'am.

01:04:44.394 --> 01:04:45.918
What happened?
- Nothing.

01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:16.756
Yes Choudhary, tell me.

01:05:16.826 --> 01:05:18.487
Any idea, where Liquid is?

01:05:19.329 --> 01:05:20.660
No. Did you try calling him?

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.322
Yes, his phone is switched off.

01:05:22.665 --> 01:05:23.893
Okay, I'll try.

01:05:38.881 --> 01:05:40.439
Where had you been?

01:05:40.683 --> 01:05:42.378
Office.

01:05:42.452 --> 01:05:46.320
At this time, in the office?
What you were doing?

01:05:47.857 --> 01:05:52.419
Nothing.. but Charu
was late in the office.

01:05:52.495 --> 01:05:55.555
Then, were you busy with Charu?

01:05:56.633 --> 01:05:59.397
A lonely girl..
2 o'clock in the night.

01:06:00.303 --> 01:06:01.736
Why are you ruining your life?

01:06:01.771 --> 01:06:05.764
Forget it..
at least he dropped her.

01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:08.777
Beautiful night
and romantic drive?

01:06:12.749 --> 01:06:14.341
Go to sector 50.

01:06:15.785 --> 01:06:16.979
What did he say?

01:06:17.787 --> 01:06:20.654
Abhi is going to come now.
Please, keep quiet.

01:06:21.391 --> 01:06:22.790
If he knows that I am with you
at 2 o'clock in the night.

01:06:22.859 --> 01:06:24.019
He'll feel odd.

01:06:24.294 --> 01:06:27.559
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:06:27.797 --> 01:06:31.460
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''
- Hello, hi.

01:06:31.601 --> 01:06:34.968
Seriously. ''The boy agreed.
He became a dog.'' Very.

01:06:35.338 --> 01:06:38.671
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:06:38.741 --> 01:06:42.336
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:44.377
''The eyes became small.''

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:48.042
''What situation I've fallen into?''

01:06:48.318 --> 01:06:51.776
''I became old in youthful days.''

01:06:51.854 --> 01:06:56.655
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:06:58.561 --> 01:06:59.653
What are you thinking?

01:07:01.998 --> 01:07:03.625
Romantic drive.

01:07:06.369 --> 01:07:10.965
Rajjo is becoming fat.
Neha is feeding you good food.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.731
Liquid has become thin.
Charu is making him dance.

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:14.970
Idiot.

01:07:17.847 --> 01:07:21.248
Choudhary, today was
Riya's birthday, isn't it?

01:07:21.584 --> 01:07:22.778
Yes.

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:25.746
You are here?

01:07:26.689 --> 01:07:28.020
You want tea.

01:07:28.491 --> 01:07:30.686
Idiot, since last three years..

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.625
..you have not offered
even a glass of water..

01:07:32.662 --> 01:07:36.621
..and today when the girl
has kicked, you remember tea?

01:07:37.033 --> 01:07:38.398
Make it.

01:07:38.835 --> 01:07:41.702
Rajat, you are here at this hour?

01:07:41.738 --> 01:07:44.730
Why? Is it only your
right to get kicked by girls?

01:07:44.807 --> 01:07:46.672
This time will be hard for you.

01:07:46.876 --> 01:07:48.776
It is such late and
you haven't returned yet.

01:07:48.845 --> 01:07:51.473
It is good.
Boy is becoming a man.

01:07:51.547 --> 01:07:54.516
You don't curse
my Rajjo to become man.

01:07:54.951 --> 01:08:00.583
He has become so weak these days.

01:08:04.794 --> 01:08:06.785
Choudhary.
- Yes.

01:08:06.863 --> 01:08:11.857
You know during the olden time when
the kings were going for hunting..

01:08:12.468 --> 01:08:14.959
..they used to leave some
people to guard their wives.

01:08:15.605 --> 01:08:19.564
They used to entertain the queen
as well as guard them from danger.

01:08:19.742 --> 01:08:21.004
Move your hand.

01:08:41.964 --> 01:08:44.728
Why do girls treat sex as a favor?

01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:46.694
What?

01:08:46.769 --> 01:08:47.997
What are you saying?

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:51.296
No seriously. They do as
if they are doing a favor on you.

01:08:51.374 --> 01:08:53.774
If they are in mood.
Then it is okay. It is right.

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:55.470
Think, what if you are not in mood?

01:08:55.578 --> 01:08:58.513
What do you mean by that?
What are you talking about?

01:08:58.814 --> 01:09:00.009
Does it happen?

01:09:00.283 --> 01:09:03.479
Seriously, one day if the guy says,
I don't feel like..

01:09:03.553 --> 01:09:04.814
You don't meet her for weeks and..

01:09:04.886 --> 01:09:06.582
..then who'll bear her
emotional nature?

01:09:06.656 --> 01:09:09.886
You don't find me attractive anymore.
Just because it is small.

01:09:09.959 --> 01:09:12.689
We don't say anything.
They say it when not in mood.

01:09:12.728 --> 01:09:15.560
You don't find me attractive anymore.
Because I don't have six packs.

01:09:15.631 --> 01:09:17.826
Yes, because we know it is true.

01:09:19.335 --> 01:09:20.461
Actually, the thing is..

01:09:20.536 --> 01:09:23.437
..if treated like this..
they can get it whenever they want.

01:09:23.506 --> 01:09:25.439
If a girl has to do
something like this..

01:09:25.508 --> 01:09:26.805
..she can get a guy in a jiffy.

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:28.908
The only thing is
she should be in mood.

01:09:28.978 --> 01:09:32.435
We don't have this luxury.
We have to work hard for it.

01:09:32.849 --> 01:09:34.749
Actually, there is
no unity in the boys.

01:09:34.951 --> 01:09:36.975
It never happened that
if you dump any girl..

01:09:37.252 --> 01:09:38.277
..and other one is
standing in the queue..

01:09:38.386 --> 01:09:40.354
..and she will ask you to
take her to your bedroom.

01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:42.287
If any girl dumps a boy,

01:09:42.358 --> 01:09:44.952
10 guys will be standing in the
queue wagging their tails like dog.

01:09:45.027 --> 01:09:47.587
We guys are such. There's no unity.

01:09:47.763 --> 01:09:49.754
We should make a union of guys.

01:09:49.832 --> 01:09:52.733
In that if any girl dumps
a boy then for the next two years..

01:09:52.801 --> 01:09:54.827
..no guy should even talk
to that girl. Then see..

01:09:55.505 --> 01:09:56.563
Correct.

01:09:56.706 --> 01:09:58.435
We'll make you the president of
the union.

01:09:58.608 --> 01:09:59.939
By the way,
you are more experienced..

01:10:00.009 --> 01:10:01.601
..in not touching anyone till now.

01:10:07.483 --> 01:10:08.973
Let's go out somewhere.

01:10:09.552 --> 01:10:10.712
Where?

01:10:10.786 --> 01:10:12.947
Goa or Shimla.
What difference will it make?

01:10:13.389 --> 01:10:15.550
Only we three. No one else.

01:10:15.925 --> 01:10:17.790
Okay, let's go.

01:10:18.828 --> 01:10:20.489
You should've waited
for some time more.

01:10:21.464 --> 01:10:22.624
Bye.

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.494
This is too much.

01:10:26.469 --> 01:10:27.834
It is 9..

01:10:27.904 --> 01:10:31.032
If Rahul knows that I am still out,
he will be angry.

01:10:31.774 --> 01:10:34.299
For God sake. Is she his
girlfriend or maidservant?

01:10:34.377 --> 01:10:37.642
What is the use of such relationship
in which there is no personal space?

01:10:40.783 --> 01:10:45.345
I know.. you know, this is
a good thing about our relationship..

01:10:45.421 --> 01:10:46.945
..is because of you only.

01:10:48.491 --> 01:10:51.824
You know, I love you,
Babu. Because you let me be.

01:10:53.896 --> 01:10:56.763
Of course, personal
spaces is very important.

01:10:57.033 --> 01:10:58.500
Correct.

01:11:00.469 --> 01:11:01.766
You are lucky to have me.

01:11:04.974 --> 01:11:09.035
Neha I am going for
a vacation on this weekend.

01:11:09.845 --> 01:11:11.710
I, Liquid, and Choudhary.

01:11:12.548 --> 01:11:17.485
Actually, we don't get time. So,
we thought of going out on a trip.

01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:19.983
Shall I go?

01:11:20.856 --> 01:11:21.948
Sure.

01:11:25.294 --> 01:11:27.285
Will you stay alone for three days?

01:11:27.363 --> 01:11:28.660
Of course.

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:03.398
Rajat..
- What?

01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:08.436
Baby, even I want to join you.

01:12:09.538 --> 01:12:12.974
I'll not disturb you
at all. I promise.

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:19.570
You stay separately.
I'll live separately.

01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:21.742
Tell me.

01:12:24.387 --> 01:12:25.445
Okay. Let's go.

01:12:36.966 --> 01:12:38.297
Yes, Choudhary.

01:12:38.367 --> 01:12:40.301
We three are on conference.
- Okay.

01:12:40.536 --> 01:12:41.867
Have you decided the place?

01:12:41.937 --> 01:12:43.598
Yes, Goa.

01:12:43.673 --> 01:12:46.506
Good choice. In fact,
this is great choice.

01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:49.610
It is said that whenever you go
to Goa. Go there like bachelors.

01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:51.647
We'll celebrate a bachelors party.

01:12:51.714 --> 01:12:54.774
Has Rajjo got the
application signed from his madam?

01:12:54.817 --> 01:12:56.717
Did he?
- Yes, everything is done.

01:12:56.786 --> 01:13:00.313
You tell me, are you happy?
- Very much.

01:13:00.389 --> 01:13:04.257
There will be great fun.
Only you, me, and Rajjo.

01:13:04.293 --> 01:13:05.760
Yes, absolutely.

01:13:05.828 --> 01:13:09.628
Listen, Riya and Neha
are also coming. - What?

01:13:09.799 --> 01:13:12.393
Yes, Rajat turned this
bachelor's party into honeymoon.

01:13:12.468 --> 01:13:13.560
How?

01:13:13.636 --> 01:13:15.729
He said to Neha then
she was also interested to come..

01:13:15.771 --> 01:13:17.568
..and Rajjo couldn't refuse her.

01:13:18.741 --> 01:13:19.935
Oh.

01:13:20.009 --> 01:13:24.969
Listen, then Neha told
Riya and asked her to join.

01:13:25.047 --> 01:13:27.709
They will make their
vacation and we will make our own.

01:13:28.417 --> 01:13:30.317
Then I have booked
for the five tickets.

01:13:30.553 --> 01:13:32.282
This is not done.

01:13:32.722 --> 01:13:34.849
It is good that
I don't have any girlfriend.

01:13:37.526 --> 01:13:38.584
Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:38.861 --> 01:13:40.522
Choudhary. Hold on for a second.

01:13:40.696 --> 01:13:43.665
Riya had called and you
didn't tell me about it the trip?

01:13:43.733 --> 01:13:45.530
Don't you want to go?

01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:47.291
It is not like that.

01:13:47.403 --> 01:13:49.530
I am joking. I am in.

01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:51.435
Just tell me who do
I give the ticket money to.

01:13:51.474 --> 01:13:52.702
Okay.
- Bye.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.444
Choudhary.
- I'll book six.

01:14:03.419 --> 01:14:04.943
Rajjo, may you get ruined.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:09.286
Trust me. These girls are
not going to disturb us.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:21.774
Babu, will we stay here?

01:14:32.696 --> 01:14:35.426
Idiot, Rajjo, enjoy. With this money
we could've visited Phuket.

01:14:35.699 --> 01:14:36.927
Massage included.

01:14:37.167 --> 01:14:38.725
Pal, there is no tension here..

01:14:38.768 --> 01:14:41.703
..and you can do anything
whatever you want.

01:14:41.771 --> 01:14:43.136
There's no disturbance.

01:14:48.078 --> 01:14:49.204
Yes, Babu..

01:14:50.814 --> 01:14:53.044
No, we are drinking beer.

01:14:55.018 --> 01:15:00.854
No Babu, I will not drink more.
I know. I will not drink.

01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:04.054
Bye.

01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:08.026
Hello.
- Hi.

01:15:08.098 --> 01:15:09.463
Nice hat.
- Thanks.

01:15:09.733 --> 01:15:11.200
So, what are you doing?

01:15:19.309 --> 01:15:20.799
Hi, boys.

01:15:20.877 --> 01:15:22.037
What's up?

01:15:25.348 --> 01:15:28.078
This is good place and
there is no tension at all.

01:15:31.688 --> 01:15:34.816
Look there.
- I know.

01:15:39.162 --> 01:15:41.722
See Choudhary, I love Goa.

01:15:42.065 --> 01:15:44.192
You know there must be some
rules in our country and..

01:15:44.267 --> 01:15:46.167
..that is..
anyone wearing small clothes..

01:15:46.236 --> 01:15:49.228
..he should be punished for
one or two years. What say?

01:15:49.939 --> 01:15:51.065
Oh God.

01:15:59.883 --> 01:16:02.181
This is a good place.
There's no tension here.

01:16:02.285 --> 01:16:03.309
Cheers..

01:16:03.386 --> 01:16:05.286
Oh God, they are here.

01:16:14.798 --> 01:16:16.698
This is also good place.
There's no tension..

01:16:16.766 --> 01:16:18.757
Shut up! Don't say anything now.

01:16:25.975 --> 01:16:27.340
Oh God..

01:16:31.981 --> 01:16:34.006
They are our girls, isn't it?

01:17:16.392 --> 01:17:19.122
''Oh handsome boy.''

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:23.221
''Come closer to me.''

01:17:24.334 --> 01:17:26.234
''Oh handsome boy.''

01:17:26.269 --> 01:17:28.237
''Come closer to me.''

01:17:28.271 --> 01:17:31.832
''Have a drink with me
and let's do party.''

01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:35.639
''Come closer to me.
Embrace me and kiss me.''

01:17:35.712 --> 01:17:39.341
''Feel my breaths.
Deal with this heart.''

01:17:39.382 --> 01:17:42.408
''Do it.''

01:17:43.219 --> 01:17:46.882
''Come closer to me.
Embrace me and kiss me.''

01:17:46.956 --> 01:17:50.414
''Feel my breaths.
Deal with this heart.''

01:17:50.693 --> 01:17:54.720
''Enjoy life.
You'll love this deal.''

01:17:54.797 --> 01:17:59.996
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:18:00.069 --> 01:18:02.264
''Let's do party.''

01:18:02.338 --> 01:18:07.435
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:09.905
''Let's do party.''

01:18:09.979 --> 01:18:14.973
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:18:15.051 --> 01:18:17.349
''Let's do party.''

01:18:32.068 --> 01:18:35.868
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

01:18:35.939 --> 01:18:39.705
''I am a beautiful girl. Embrace me.''

01:18:39.776 --> 01:18:43.371
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

01:18:43.413 --> 01:18:47.406
''I am a beautiful girl. Embrace me.''

01:18:47.684 --> 01:18:51.313
''Give me your heart and
make me your life partner.''

01:18:51.421 --> 01:18:55.084
''Write a lovely chit.
Everything else is futile.''

01:18:55.291 --> 01:18:58.920
''Give me your heart and
make me your life partner.''

01:18:58.995 --> 01:19:02.294
''Write a lovely chit.
Everything else is futile.''

01:19:02.365 --> 01:19:06.267
''Forget all your
worries and let's dance.''

01:19:06.402 --> 01:19:10.031
''I am your sweetheart.
Come and dance with me.''

01:19:10.106 --> 01:19:15.635
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:19:15.712 --> 01:19:17.907
''Let's do party.''

01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:23.112
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:19:23.186 --> 01:19:25.620
''Let's do party.''

01:19:25.688 --> 01:19:30.785
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:33.021
''Let's do party.''

01:19:33.096 --> 01:19:39.160
''Oh handsome boy. Let's do party.''

01:19:40.336 --> 01:19:44.170
''Come on, feel the beat and move
your feet. Can you feel the heat?''

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.003
''When you are dancing next to me..''

01:19:46.075 --> 01:19:48.009
''..I want to feel
you are moving with me.''

01:19:48.077 --> 01:19:51.740
''Come on, feel the beat and move
your feet. Can you feel the heat?''

01:19:51.914 --> 01:19:55.350
''Give, give me more and
love the way we do it.''

01:19:55.418 --> 01:19:59.081
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

01:19:59.188 --> 01:20:02.919
''I am a beautiful girl.
Embrace me.''

01:20:02.992 --> 01:20:06.723
''I am a beautiful girl.
Fall in love with me.''

01:20:06.829 --> 01:20:10.856
''I am a beautiful girl.
Embrace me.''

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.700
''It is a starry night.
The luck is bright.''

01:20:14.804 --> 01:20:18.262
''Kiss me, why are you delaying?''

01:20:18.341 --> 01:20:22.107
''It is a starry night.
The luck is bright.''

01:20:22.245 --> 01:20:25.271
''Kiss me, why are you delaying?''

01:20:25.348 --> 01:20:29.307
''Do something and have fun in life.
Catch this opportunity.''

01:20:29.385 --> 01:20:33.378
''Come close with an overdose.
Come and dance with girls.''

01:20:33.656 --> 01:20:38.787
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:20:38.861 --> 01:20:41.022
''Let's do party.''

01:20:41.097 --> 01:20:46.364
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:20:46.402 --> 01:20:48.836
''Let's do party.''

01:20:48.905 --> 01:20:54.002
''Oh handsome boy.
Come closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:20:54.077 --> 01:20:56.272
''Let's do party.''

01:20:56.345 --> 01:21:01.408
''Oh handsome boy. Come
closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:21:01.684 --> 01:21:03.914
''Let's do party.''

01:21:03.986 --> 01:21:09.117
''Oh handsome boy. Come
closer to me. Agree to it.''

01:21:09.192 --> 01:21:12.059
''Let's do party.''

01:21:16.032 --> 01:21:18.865
How many dresses you
are changing in a day?

01:21:19.368 --> 01:21:22.030
Why? You don't like what you see?

01:21:22.338 --> 01:21:24.932
Whatever I see, looks lovely.

01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:27.234
So, you want to see mom?

01:21:28.778 --> 01:21:30.769
I don't want to get
beaten by Choudhary.

01:21:31.013 --> 01:21:34.312
I will convince Vicky,
but you think about Neha.

01:21:34.917 --> 01:21:36.282
He is all yours, really.

01:21:38.988 --> 01:21:41.081
Shall we go for a walk after dinner?
- Yes.

01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:44.623
No, I am not in mood to walk.

01:21:45.294 --> 01:21:46.659
What happened?

01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:50.023
Headache.. that's all.

01:21:51.801 --> 01:21:53.029
Charu.

01:21:54.103 --> 01:21:55.695
No, you go ahead.

01:21:56.772 --> 01:22:00.333
So, looks like I am going to have
all three boys to myself tonight.

01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:03.677
Nice. - Are you sure,
you don't want to come?

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:06.280
Listen..
- Let's go.

01:22:10.786 --> 01:22:16.588
''Come, o beloved.''

01:22:16.692 --> 01:22:22.858
''Come, I am very youthful.''

01:22:26.068 --> 01:22:29.731
Neha, you're mistaken.
Our relationship is very pious.

01:22:29.939 --> 01:22:31.804
Can I have a word with Rajat,
please?

01:22:33.075 --> 01:22:34.337
Yes, sure.

01:22:48.758 --> 01:22:49.986
You are okay?

01:22:51.093 --> 01:22:52.390
No I am not.

01:22:53.029 --> 01:22:54.257
What happened?

01:22:54.697 --> 01:22:56.688
Why are you pretending as
though nothing happened?

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.392
I mean, I had headache and it was
necessary for you to go on walk?

01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:03.065
Neha I thought that
you are giving excuse.

01:23:03.139 --> 01:23:06.802
Suppose I have made excuse, but you
don't bother even to know about it.

01:23:07.176 --> 01:23:09.804
Babu, I didn't know that
you'll be so angry with me.

01:23:10.012 --> 01:23:12.674
This place is good.
There's no tension here.

01:23:13.983 --> 01:23:18.283
Stop it, Rajat. Can't I see?
I know you're loving all this.

01:23:18.654 --> 01:23:21.589
Flirting with Riya. I know that's
the reason you went for a walk.

01:23:21.724 --> 01:23:23.282
And you are okay
with me not coming.

01:23:23.626 --> 01:23:25.253
What is going on, lovebirds?

01:23:25.628 --> 01:23:27.823
Neha what are you talking?
- Am I mad to come here with you?

01:23:27.897 --> 01:23:29.728
Babu, there's nothing like that.

01:23:29.799 --> 01:23:33.701
Now that your quality time is crude,
wanna go for a walk, darling?

01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:38.162
No, I will not go
anywhere leaving Liquid alone.

01:23:39.175 --> 01:23:42.303
I was talking about
Liquid and not about you.

01:23:45.181 --> 01:23:48.947
Let her go. You go and
continue with your romance.

01:23:51.754 --> 01:23:56.214
By the way, Charu is also alone.
She's suffering from cold.

01:23:56.959 --> 01:23:58.654
I think she needs you.

01:24:02.331 --> 01:24:04.356
So?
- So?

01:24:05.368 --> 01:24:07.063
Shall we?
- Let's go.

01:24:11.274 --> 01:24:13.640
Charu, what is the matter?

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:21.011
Abhi had called.
He didn't like mine coming to Goa.

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:27.114
Did he say something?
- The same, usual.

01:24:27.923 --> 01:24:29.823
He said, you didn't
ask me before leaving.

01:24:29.892 --> 01:24:33.384
You don't bother
about me and all that.

01:24:38.734 --> 01:24:41.669
Okay, listen. Shift a bit.

01:24:44.373 --> 01:24:49.868
Listen to me. Why are you wasting
your holiday thinking about him?

01:24:51.213 --> 01:24:53.704
I am sure, you'll sort it out.
Everything will be fine.

01:24:56.252 --> 01:25:00.848
Okay, smile now. Smile. Smile.

01:25:42.198 --> 01:25:45.292
Please. Stop now.

01:25:49.238 --> 01:25:50.432
Wait.

01:25:59.982 --> 01:26:01.449
Yes Varun, tell me.

01:26:03.753 --> 01:26:05.448
Why should I inform you, Varun?

01:26:06.722 --> 01:26:08.952
Why are you bothered who I am with?

01:26:10.259 --> 01:26:13.126
I've come here alone. Okay?

01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:18.096
You don't have to. Varun,
why don't you understand?

01:26:18.968 --> 01:26:20.196
Please..

01:26:36.318 --> 01:26:42.951
''Please stop running,
from this commotion.''

01:26:43.025 --> 01:26:48.224
''I don't know what you mean to me.''

01:26:49.965 --> 01:26:56.962
''Things you do to me.
I don't understand.''

01:26:57.373 --> 01:27:01.935
''Just let me be me.''

01:27:31.273 --> 01:27:38.008
''Please stop running,
from this commotion.''

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.072
''I don't know what you mean to me.''

01:27:41.150 --> 01:27:44.119
Take the sweater as the
cold increases in the evening.

01:27:44.386 --> 01:27:45.819
Thanks.

01:27:49.725 --> 01:27:52.091
I don't understand
what Rajat wants from me.

01:27:53.095 --> 01:27:54.221
What happened, Neha?

01:27:54.263 --> 01:27:56.356
I don't know. You ask him.

01:27:57.233 --> 01:28:00.669
Since we've come back from the
resort, he hasn't spoken to me.

01:28:04.373 --> 01:28:07.934
I hope you are not getting late
for the office? - No, its alright.

01:28:09.211 --> 01:28:11.236
Fine. I fought with him..

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:14.679
..but should I hold his
leg and apologize to him?

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:16.777
What's the problem?

01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:20.782
Am I demanding? Whatever he wants,
I am doing the same.

01:28:23.192 --> 01:28:25.353
If he does not like me,
then let him tell me.

01:28:28.931 --> 01:28:31.399
God, I left my house and
without telling anything to mom..

01:28:31.634 --> 01:28:34.125
..and dad I am staying
with him. Does he even care?

01:28:34.236 --> 01:28:37.228
You don't worry I will talk to him.

01:28:42.177 --> 01:28:46.011
What is going on with Neha?
- Why? What happened?

01:28:46.682 --> 01:28:48.115
She had come in the morning.

01:28:49.418 --> 01:28:50.851
What did she say?

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.686
That you are not talking to her.
What is your problem?

01:28:54.924 --> 01:28:58.416
Problem? Problem is that
she is a girl and nothing else.

01:28:58.661 --> 01:29:00.959
Problem is, I wish there shouldn't
be any problem in my life.

01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:02.759
But if there's no problem
in my life..

01:29:02.831 --> 01:29:04.423
..this becomes
a biggest problem to her.

01:29:04.667 --> 01:29:07.261
Why she is worried?
She has to celebrate.

01:29:07.336 --> 01:29:09.133
Because, this is exactly
what she wants.

01:29:09.204 --> 01:29:10.432
Seriously, these days,
when she opens her mouth to talk..

01:29:10.673 --> 01:29:12.038
..feel like stuffing
something into her mouth.

01:29:12.107 --> 01:29:14.769
Trust me, I had it all in
six months. I've seen everything.

01:29:14.843 --> 01:29:17.379
What love? What relationship?
And what happiness?

01:29:17.379 --> 01:29:19.973
Relationship means, enter
into it with your own happiness.

01:29:20.049 --> 01:29:22.779
After that.. all you have to
worry about is.. her happiness..

01:29:22.851 --> 01:29:24.614
..her birthday, her dog's birthday.

01:29:24.687 --> 01:29:26.951
Her New Year..
even you have a New Year.

01:29:27.156 --> 01:29:29.181
No one can make these girls happy.

01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:30.758
A happy woman is a myth.

01:29:30.826 --> 01:29:32.157
For instance, Batman's girlfriend.

01:29:32.227 --> 01:29:33.717
Until he didn't become Batman..

01:29:33.796 --> 01:29:35.627
..she kept saying:
You don't do anything.

01:29:35.698 --> 01:29:38.895
You are useless. You are impotent.
How can I stay with a man like you?

01:29:38.968 --> 01:29:41.095
Poor guy became Batman..
that day she said..

01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:43.832
..you became batman?
I wanted to be with a normal man.

01:29:43.906 --> 01:29:45.396
How can I stay with you?

01:29:45.641 --> 01:29:47.233
The entire fault is of stories.

01:29:47.309 --> 01:29:48.708
Bloody Bollywood romantic spices.

01:29:48.777 --> 01:29:50.677
A girl and a guy falls in love.
They both stay together.

01:29:50.746 --> 01:29:53.044
The movie ends.
No one tells the story after this.

01:29:53.115 --> 01:29:54.412
I'll tell you the story after that.

01:29:54.683 --> 01:29:57.243
If the guy doesn't hug the girl
two days there's a problem.

01:29:57.319 --> 01:30:00.117
If he hugs her.. she says,
you are cheap. This is too much.

01:30:00.422 --> 01:30:02.413
They don't get tired from shopping.

01:30:02.691 --> 01:30:04.386
First cushions and now curtains.

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:06.924
Cushions didn't match the curtains,
so she bought more cushions.

01:30:06.996 --> 01:30:08.930
I have so many mugs that
if I sell them..

01:30:08.998 --> 01:30:10.260
..I can bear my life for a month.

01:30:10.332 --> 01:30:12.857
She goes to buy something
and buys something else.

01:30:13.002 --> 01:30:15.334
She will irritate me for two weeks
saying she wants to buy a table..

01:30:15.371 --> 01:30:17.999
..she spent 5 hours in the
mall and bought dirty slippers.

01:30:18.073 --> 01:30:20.940
Again start irritating
that she needs to buy a table.

01:30:21.677 --> 01:30:23.838
I am working in the
office and she calls..

01:30:23.912 --> 01:30:26.005
As soon as I answer the phone,
I tell her I cannot talk to her.

01:30:26.081 --> 01:30:27.742
Is it so difficult to understand?

01:30:27.816 --> 01:30:29.249
What will happen
if you talk to me for two minutes?

01:30:29.318 --> 01:30:31.650
If I talk to you for two minutes,
what will you gain?

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.982
I won't be able to
talk to you properly.

01:30:33.055 --> 01:30:35.182
Then if I disconnect the phone
without saying 'I love you'..

01:30:35.257 --> 01:30:36.383
..she starts her melodrama.

01:30:36.859 --> 01:30:39.054
This mobile phone
has irritated me a lot.

01:30:39.128 --> 01:30:40.390
It has made my life miserable.

01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:42.620
It is like a noose to me.

01:30:42.865 --> 01:30:44.264
Did you see their ads?

01:30:44.333 --> 01:30:47.200
1 paisa per second.
So, keep calling.

01:30:47.269 --> 01:30:49.999
If the price is less,
how much can a person talk?

01:30:50.072 --> 01:30:51.403
Answer them for this..

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.268
You can't talk to me.
You've lost interest in me.

01:30:54.343 --> 01:30:57.107
If you didn't want to talk,
why did I call you?

01:30:57.179 --> 01:30:59.409
Oh mother, how would
I know why you called me?

01:30:59.648 --> 01:31:01.309
Go and question Bharti Mittal.

01:31:01.717 --> 01:31:04.811
I am telling you, it is not a dog,
but a bitch in the ad..

01:31:04.887 --> 01:31:06.411
Seriously, I can bet on it.

01:31:06.822 --> 01:31:08.653
Wherever you go, we follow.

01:31:08.724 --> 01:31:09.782
What do you think?

01:31:09.858 --> 01:31:10.984
Columbus didn't know
he was coming to India..

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.152
..and he came here accidentally?

01:31:12.227 --> 01:31:13.785
No.. he knew about it.

01:31:13.862 --> 01:31:15.693
That poor man wanted
to go somewhere far.

01:31:15.798 --> 01:31:17.595
He had to tell his wife
that he's going to India.

01:31:17.666 --> 01:31:19.065
Or she would've questioned him.

01:31:19.168 --> 01:31:20.760
Where are you going?
Why are you going?

01:31:20.869 --> 01:31:22.860
Really? Don't you know
where you are going?

01:31:22.971 --> 01:31:25.667
Why don't you tell me clearly,
you are going away from me?

01:31:25.741 --> 01:31:27.902
Till today the people of the
world make fun of that poor guy.

01:31:28.711 --> 01:31:31.202
I am working in the office, I get
a SMS which says 'I love you.'

01:31:31.313 --> 01:31:33.611
So, I reply to her
'I love you too.'

01:31:33.682 --> 01:31:35.707
Then I keep getting
SMS one after other.

01:31:35.784 --> 01:31:37.308
What work does
she do in the office?

01:31:37.386 --> 01:31:39.718
If I don't reply for two SMSs.
I get a call immediately.

01:31:39.788 --> 01:31:41.949
If you don't answer the phone,
you get a message in 10 minutes..

01:31:42.024 --> 01:31:43.321
..I don't think it
is working anymore.

01:31:43.392 --> 01:31:44.950
In 10 minutes it goes
from 'Babu, I love you'..

01:31:45.027 --> 01:31:46.221
..to 'It's not working anymore.'

01:31:46.295 --> 01:31:48.160
This is when
they are not even down.

01:31:48.230 --> 01:31:50.698
Now I know why men
die of heart attack..

01:31:50.766 --> 01:31:52.666
..and why are gays so successful.

01:31:52.735 --> 01:31:55.169
Because they don't have
woman to ruin their happiness.

01:31:55.637 --> 01:31:58.834
People say: Behind every
successful man there's a woman..

01:31:59.007 --> 01:32:01.874
True.. but no one says that:
behind every unsuccessful man..

01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:03.241
..there is also a woman.

01:32:03.679 --> 01:32:06.671
Anybody can say that
unsuccessful people..

01:32:06.749 --> 01:32:09.081
..are more in quantity than
successful people in this world.

01:32:10.085 --> 01:32:11.780
I am working in the office.

01:32:11.854 --> 01:32:12.980
I tell her, I'll be late.

01:32:13.055 --> 01:32:15.046
She won't have her food.
She'll go to sleep hungry.

01:32:15.124 --> 01:32:17.957
If I tell her to eat, it is
a problem. Shall I quit my job?

01:32:18.026 --> 01:32:20.620
Go home. Appease them.
Make them have their food.

01:32:20.696 --> 01:32:22.357
Doing all this, one
doesn't feel hungry.

01:32:22.631 --> 01:32:24.758
Even after doing all this,
if the person is sitting..

01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:26.323
..in a corner peacefully..

01:32:26.368 --> 01:32:29.098
..then she comes asking:
what are you thinking?

01:32:29.171 --> 01:32:31.002
What are you thinking?
What are you thinking?

01:32:31.073 --> 01:32:32.267
Oh God, I am not thinking anything.

01:32:32.341 --> 01:32:34.366
I am thinking how do
I shut your mouth?

01:32:34.943 --> 01:32:36.934
What are you thinking? Tell her
to place a camera in my head.

01:32:37.346 --> 01:32:39.371
After all this: we never talk.
We need to talk.

01:32:39.648 --> 01:32:41.172
I don't think it's working anymore.

01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:43.377
I am telling you. You cannot
discuss anything with a woman.

01:32:43.619 --> 01:32:44.779
Because, they call it a discussion..

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.220
..but any discussion
with a woman is an argument.

01:32:47.389 --> 01:32:50.290
Boss, you can't win
them in an argument.

01:32:50.359 --> 01:32:52.657
Because, we men have a basic need.

01:32:52.728 --> 01:32:53.922
To make sense in an argument.

01:32:53.996 --> 01:32:55.122
It make no difference to the girls.

01:32:55.197 --> 01:32:57.927
Why should she lose
the argument for useless things?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:32:59.865
They won't argue
for today's matter..

01:32:59.935 --> 01:33:01.994
They'll fight about this
matter after two months.

01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:04.971
One doesn't even remember what
had happened two months back.

01:33:05.073 --> 01:33:07.940
Girls remember it. This is not
a small weapon, but a big one.

01:33:08.010 --> 01:33:10.103
We'll use this point
in a bigger argument.

01:33:10.913 --> 01:33:13.882
Try to prove that you are right..

01:33:13.949 --> 01:33:17.180
..you would feel that you
would surely prove with this point.

01:33:17.252 --> 01:33:20.153
Then you'll hear her say..
don't point your finger at me..

01:33:20.222 --> 01:33:21.348
You wouldn't have noticed..

01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:23.649
..that your innocent
finger is pointing towards them.

01:33:23.692 --> 01:33:25.956
Suddenly the whole argument
will flush down the gutter..

01:33:25.994 --> 01:33:28.622
..and the topic will be
'how dare you point a finger at me?'

01:33:28.697 --> 01:33:30.096
Who made this rule? Who made it?

01:33:30.165 --> 01:33:33.896
If they throw a shoe at you in
that argument, that's nothing.

01:33:33.969 --> 01:33:36.870
But if you just point your
finger at them, the matter ends.

01:33:36.939 --> 01:33:38.236
She's right and you are wrong.

01:33:39.741 --> 01:33:42.801
Why do they play serpent
beats before the wedding?

01:33:42.945 --> 01:33:44.913
Because even the drummer is
giving you an indication..

01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:46.106
..as who's coming into your life.

01:33:46.181 --> 01:33:48.012
This their signature tune.

01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:50.775
You tell me, why did she come here?

01:33:50.986 --> 01:33:52.180
If I do the same?

01:33:52.254 --> 01:33:55.382
If I call her friend and
share my problems with her?

01:33:55.891 --> 01:33:58.382
She would say:
you called my friend?

01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:01.229
You want to gain their sympathy?

01:34:01.296 --> 01:34:03.127
Why don't you go
and sleep with her?

01:34:03.398 --> 01:34:05.025
It is ridiculous, pal.

01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:09.398
The finger thing..
it had happened with me too.

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:14.131
What was the need to go
to Choudhary?

01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:16.934
Tell me.

01:34:20.716 --> 01:34:25.153
Neha, why are you weeping?
What is the problem?

01:34:26.021 --> 01:34:27.386
Nothing.

01:34:27.823 --> 01:34:29.415
Then why are you weeping?

01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:38.063
Why are you behaving
like this with me?

01:34:38.867 --> 01:34:41.859
I am sorry,
I told something to you.

01:34:43.438 --> 01:34:47.101
But why are you behaving like this?

01:34:49.311 --> 01:34:51.836
Babu, I was fighting.

01:34:53.048 --> 01:34:55.039
Is this a fight?

01:34:56.451 --> 01:35:01.047
Whatever you want to say,
you tell me. What is this method?

01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:06.720
Babu, forget it.. - You know
this is one thing I can't take.

01:35:08.196 --> 01:35:12.064
But I am talking with you.
Stop crying, please.

01:35:13.035 --> 01:35:18.234
I hadn't told you..
I got down after reaching there.

01:35:18.774 --> 01:35:22.972
In such feeling,
I just wanted to be with you.

01:35:23.412 --> 01:35:26.074
Babu, you should've told to me.

01:35:26.148 --> 01:35:27.672
When could I tell you?

01:35:27.883 --> 01:35:29.282
Everyone were sitting there.

01:35:30.085 --> 01:35:34.385
You didn't have two
minutes to spend with me.

01:35:35.424 --> 01:35:39.690
Sorry, Babu. I am so sorry.
Now it will never happen.

01:35:39.928 --> 01:35:43.694
Rajat, I know your friends
are very important for you.

01:35:43.765 --> 01:35:45.892
But am I nothing to you?

01:35:45.968 --> 01:35:47.959
Babu, there is nothing like this.

01:35:48.303 --> 01:35:54.401
I'm sorry. Even I didn't know.
Now it will never happen. I promise.

01:35:55.877 --> 01:35:57.902
You'll make me cry again?

01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:00.244
No, Babu. Never

01:36:00.449 --> 01:36:02.041
Promise?

01:36:13.829 --> 01:36:15.057
You?

01:36:17.165 --> 01:36:18.393
You didn't go for lunch.

01:36:19.201 --> 01:36:21.032
What is this, Nishant?

01:36:23.972 --> 01:36:25.997
Charu, Choudhary..

01:36:26.074 --> 01:36:28.235
Abhi was angry with me
before me going to Goa..

01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:30.403
..and now Vikral has
organized this exhibition.

01:36:30.712 --> 01:36:32.976
Do you realize,
if anyone saw this picture..

01:36:33.048 --> 01:36:35.073
..I will become the gossip topic
in the office?

01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:38.142
No, don't worry.
I will talk to Choudhary.

01:36:38.854 --> 01:36:40.788
Whom all did you tell about this?

01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:43.418
About what?

01:36:43.658 --> 01:36:45.922
About whom? About the kiss.

01:36:46.995 --> 01:36:49.259
No one, Charu.
Why will I tell anyone?

01:36:49.364 --> 01:36:54.063
It is like an achievement to you,
right? - Achievement?

01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:57.161
Yes, your promise to take
me to Goa is now fulfilled.

01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.398
When did I tell you?

01:36:59.674 --> 01:37:00.732
Listen Nishan..

01:37:00.809 --> 01:37:03.903
..don't think there's something
between us because of the kiss.

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.247
I'm shocked about it
as much as you're.

01:37:08.417 --> 01:37:10.977
It wasn't a plan..
- Give me Vikrant's number.

01:37:11.253 --> 01:37:13.813
I'll call Choudhary myself.
- Call him right away.

01:37:13.955 --> 01:37:15.855
I made a mistake coming with you.

01:38:06.341 --> 01:38:08.935
Dear, Charu,
all I want to say is that..

01:38:09.144 --> 01:38:11.908
..the kiss of anything like
that was not at all intentional.

01:38:12.047 --> 01:38:13.605
It was shocking for me as well.

01:38:13.715 --> 01:38:15.273
I'm really sorry that it happened.

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.089
Hello.

01:38:28.363 --> 01:38:29.853
Hi.
- Hi.

01:38:31.266 --> 01:38:33.166
Charu, I..

01:38:33.668 --> 01:38:36.136
Relax, everything is fine.

01:38:36.771 --> 01:38:38.238
I was a little angry yesterday.

01:38:38.707 --> 01:38:39.935
Thanks.

01:38:40.008 --> 01:38:41.669
Guess what is in this?

01:38:42.344 --> 01:38:43.936
What is in that?

01:38:44.079 --> 01:38:46.411
Flight tickets.
I am going to Hyderabad.

01:38:46.781 --> 01:38:49.306
To Abhijeet.
- Yes.

01:38:49.651 --> 01:38:53.246
Thought I will meet him
and make him understand.

01:38:53.321 --> 01:38:55.016
Everything will be fine.

01:38:55.423 --> 01:38:59.018
You're right. Excited?

01:38:59.294 --> 01:39:02.320
What excitement? I need to go
to the parlour. And work..

01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:05.365
Why parlour?
- I want to look beautiful for him.

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.958
He will not get convinced easily.

01:39:10.172 --> 01:39:12.663
That flight is at 7.
Please come with me.

01:39:13.175 --> 01:39:15.769
No, Charu.
I actually have some work.

01:39:15.844 --> 01:39:17.675
Work at home.

01:39:18.046 --> 01:39:20.378
Hurry up. I'll bring the bag.

01:39:24.719 --> 01:39:28.246
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:39:28.323 --> 01:39:31.918
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

01:39:35.797 --> 01:39:39.233
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:39:39.401 --> 01:39:41.335
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

01:39:41.403 --> 01:39:42.927
Nishant?
- Yes?

01:39:43.138 --> 01:39:45.868
It will take time.
Can you get these things for me?

01:39:49.110 --> 01:39:51.738
Okay.
- Thanks. Okay.

01:39:51.913 --> 01:39:53.278
And please, hurry up.
- Okay.

01:39:54.049 --> 01:39:59.214
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

01:39:59.421 --> 01:40:04.916
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

01:40:05.126 --> 01:40:08.994
''What situation I've fallen into?''

01:40:09.064 --> 01:40:12.727
''I became old in youthful days.''

01:40:12.867 --> 01:40:14.129
Bill.
- Yes.

01:40:14.936 --> 01:40:16.233
Rs. 2500.

01:40:16.304 --> 01:40:19.865
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:23.670
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:40:23.778 --> 01:40:29.080
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

01:40:31.086 --> 01:40:34.647
Darn. You have cash?

01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:36.384
Yes.

01:40:38.793 --> 01:40:45.858
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:40:45.967 --> 01:40:49.698
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

01:40:49.771 --> 01:40:53.229
''Boy agreed. He became a dog.''

01:40:53.308 --> 01:40:58.769
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

01:41:07.022 --> 01:41:10.753
Whose laptop is this?

01:41:11.593 --> 01:41:12.753
Charu's.

01:41:17.766 --> 01:41:19.028
Hi, Nishant.

01:41:19.367 --> 01:41:21.597
Hi.
- I reached Hyderabad.

01:41:21.936 --> 01:41:23.301
Great.

01:41:26.074 --> 01:41:27.234
Listen..
- What happened?

01:41:27.309 --> 01:41:29.174
Listen. I will talk you later.

01:41:35.817 --> 01:41:37.114
What happened?

01:41:39.788 --> 01:41:40.982
What are you doing?

01:41:42.891 --> 01:41:44.688
I'm cleaning Charu's dirt.

01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:48.286
But why?
- Because I'm a jerk.

01:41:49.664 --> 01:41:51.222
All of us are jerks.

01:41:51.866 --> 01:41:56.030
You don't talk about everyone.
There is no competition with me.

01:41:56.638 --> 01:41:59.903
I take her to the parlour
leaving my office work behind.

01:42:00.408 --> 01:42:04.708
I go to shop taking her shopping
list while she's getting waxing done.

01:42:04.879 --> 01:42:07.074
From there I drop her to the airport
straight and then come back home.

01:42:07.148 --> 01:42:08.274
I finished her work..

01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:11.217
..so that she can spend
leisure time with her boyfriend.

01:42:15.123 --> 01:42:17.057
I agreed you're the biggest jerk.

01:42:18.326 --> 01:42:21.818
Look, you also know
that it is your fault.

01:42:23.031 --> 01:42:26.660
What about your plan of changing job?
You've been telling since long..

01:42:26.768 --> 01:42:29.293
..that there's no hike
in the salary. No growth.

01:42:29.637 --> 01:42:33.368
Got to change the job. You forgot
about your plans falling for Charu.

01:42:34.242 --> 01:42:37.109
You'd feel bad.
You're not her friend..

01:42:37.278 --> 01:42:39.041
..but you've become
her personal valet

01:42:41.216 --> 01:42:46.381
Prepare a list of companies. Go for
interviews. Come out of this mess.

01:42:50.325 --> 01:42:51.952
You're right.

01:42:56.231 --> 01:42:58.165
I again became a dog.

01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:03.794
Enough is enough.

01:43:05.006 --> 01:43:06.701
Now, I will think
only about myself.

01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:25.055
Hello. What happened?

01:43:27.195 --> 01:43:28.719
Okay.

01:43:33.201 --> 01:43:37.228
Thought everything will be
fine spending time together.

01:43:38.373 --> 01:43:40.238
But he'd a problem
since beginning..

01:43:40.308 --> 01:43:41.935
..that we hang out together.

01:43:42.844 --> 01:43:45.244
To convince him that
there's nothing between us..

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:47.705
..I said him that you proposed me..

01:43:47.816 --> 01:43:49.215
..and I refused to you.

01:43:50.118 --> 01:43:53.315
But he got more upset..
saying I didn't tell him..

01:43:53.388 --> 01:43:56.118
..and still hang out with you.

01:43:57.625 --> 01:44:00.150
Yes, but it is..
- Everything was going so nicely.

01:44:00.695 --> 01:44:02.322
We even slept together.

01:44:03.932 --> 01:44:06.924
I'm mad. I shouldn't
have told him anything.

01:44:07.202 --> 01:44:10.968
It is so stupid. I mean..
you mean nothing to me.

01:44:11.372 --> 01:44:13.636
Why is this?

01:44:18.646 --> 01:44:21.706
Anyway, what did you
do during the weekend?

01:44:22.417 --> 01:44:23.975
Nothing special.

01:44:25.954 --> 01:44:28.218
Was working..
and studying as well.

01:44:28.857 --> 01:44:34.159
Studying?
- Yes, I've interview. I'm shifting.

01:44:35.263 --> 01:44:40.132
I was planning since long. I don't
see any growth there anymore.

01:44:43.037 --> 01:44:47.997
Moreover, I'm tired of this place.

01:44:50.144 --> 01:44:52.112
You didn't tell me?

01:44:59.354 --> 01:45:00.821
What happened?

01:45:03.825 --> 01:45:06.692
Nishant, after you,
there is no one for me here.

01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:13.391
Since when you know Riya?

01:45:16.804 --> 01:45:18.635
Let's go out.
- Why?

01:45:19.007 --> 01:45:20.201
We will talk here.

01:45:20.375 --> 01:45:23.139
Let them also know
how wicked you're.

01:45:23.378 --> 01:45:26.404
Varun, this is office.
- I don't care.

01:45:27.048 --> 01:45:29.949
Riya was my life.
Why didn't you realize then?

01:45:31.085 --> 01:45:33.212
Our relationship is five years old..

01:45:33.288 --> 01:45:35.222
..and there was
breakup for fifteen times.

01:45:35.290 --> 01:45:37.383
But we always came back together.

01:45:37.425 --> 01:45:38.756
Why you are telling
all these to me?

01:45:38.826 --> 01:45:40.350
I'm telling you all these because..

01:45:40.428 --> 01:45:43.886
Varun, I'm sure things were good
between you and Riya in the past.

01:45:43.965 --> 01:45:47.059
How did you decide it was past?

01:45:47.168 --> 01:45:50.160
Now, you will tell me that
my relationship is over.

01:45:50.972 --> 01:45:53.133
Look, I'm telling you.

01:45:53.341 --> 01:45:57.038
Just stay away. Our relationship
is going through a bad phase.

01:45:57.078 --> 01:45:59.069
It happens in everyone's life.

01:46:00.148 --> 01:46:03.709
If you think you can snatch
Riya from me taking advantage of..

01:46:03.785 --> 01:46:06.754
Varun, Riya isn't a commodity
to snatch away from you.

01:46:10.425 --> 01:46:11.983
Have you guys slept?

01:46:12.126 --> 01:46:13.388
Varun, what kind of
question is this?

01:46:13.661 --> 01:46:15.060
Just tell me. Have you?

01:46:15.129 --> 01:46:16.994
This is the good question.

01:46:18.132 --> 01:46:21.033
A girl who was in relation
with someone for five years..

01:46:21.102 --> 01:46:24.071
..and if happened to share the same
bed with you in just five months..

01:46:24.138 --> 01:46:26.003
..for how long
she will stay with you?

01:46:26.774 --> 01:46:30.767
The day when she'll get bored
of you.. we will talk that day.

01:46:30.979 --> 01:46:33.004
That day I will come
to see your face.

01:46:44.292 --> 01:46:46.954
I think there's some
wounds only time can heel.

01:46:48.062 --> 01:46:51.259
Riya, stop calling him.
Don't keep in touch with him.

01:46:51.766 --> 01:46:53.324
You are talking like Varun.

01:46:53.768 --> 01:46:56.202
Listen. Don't care if I'm
behaving like Varun or not.

01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:59.000
He thinks things can still workout
between you guys if you talk to him.

01:46:59.073 --> 01:47:01.166
And.. what's the need?

01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:04.405
He will realize himself
if you stop talking to him.

01:47:04.445 --> 01:47:07.903
Vikrant, it is my personal problem.
And I know how to handle it.

01:47:08.016 --> 01:47:11.816
Riya, as we're together
your problem is mine too.

01:47:13.221 --> 01:47:15.280
Vikrant, we being
together doesn't mean..

01:47:15.323 --> 01:47:17.291
..we should interfere
in each other's problems.

01:47:17.659 --> 01:47:21.060
I have my own life.
There are things which are personal.

01:47:21.729 --> 01:47:24.698
It is my space and I don't want
anyone interfering in those matters..

01:47:24.766 --> 01:47:26.290
..even though it's you.

01:47:26.768 --> 01:47:29.828
Listen.
Don't lecture me about space.

01:47:29.904 --> 01:47:31.838
I'm just asking you to
put an end to all this.

01:47:31.906 --> 01:47:36.104
And I am telling you that I will
do it. But I will do it my way.

01:47:36.844 --> 01:47:38.175
I know how to handle it.

01:47:38.246 --> 01:47:40.737
If you knew he wouldn't have come
to my office and created scene.

01:47:40.815 --> 01:47:43.249
Had he created the same scene
outside I would've hit him.

01:47:43.317 --> 01:47:45.649
So, don't tell it is
only your problem.

01:47:47.221 --> 01:47:50.054
Don't worry. I will handle this.

01:47:51.059 --> 01:47:52.720
This wouldn't have happened
if you knew how to handle it.

01:47:52.794 --> 01:47:53.988
Vikrant..

01:47:54.062 --> 01:47:58.294
You better put and end to it
soon else I will handle it my way.

01:47:58.332 --> 01:48:00.129
Just finish it.

01:48:00.668 --> 01:48:03.762
It is easy to end five
years relation over a night.

01:48:03.838 --> 01:48:05.203
It takes time.

01:48:06.374 --> 01:48:09.104
You've never even been in
a relationship. What do you know?

01:48:23.224 --> 01:48:27.126
I was in my boss's cabin with him.

01:48:28.162 --> 01:48:30.187
So you couldn't talk with
me even for two minutes?

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.767
I'm a working girl too,
Rajat. Even I have a boss.

01:48:37.638 --> 01:48:39.731
It is like as though
you're running the company.

01:48:40.041 --> 01:48:41.838
I was in an important meeting.

01:48:41.876 --> 01:48:43.810
I've chances of going to U.K.

01:48:44.312 --> 01:48:45.643
If there are chances to go to UK..

01:48:45.713 --> 01:48:47.112
..then you cannot talk
to me over the phone.

01:48:47.749 --> 01:48:51.082
And if you go to U. K then you will
even stop answering my calls. Right?

01:48:51.419 --> 01:48:53.979
Neha, there are many tension and..

01:48:54.055 --> 01:48:56.853
..now by telling all these
things don't increase the tension.

01:48:57.024 --> 01:49:00.187
My one call leaves you restless.

01:49:00.895 --> 01:49:02.886
It is not about your call.

01:49:02.964 --> 01:49:04.727
It's about many other things.

01:49:04.999 --> 01:49:08.230
Work, family issues..
- What family issues?

01:49:08.803 --> 01:49:12.261
I have a cousin brother..
who got married two years ago.

01:49:12.673 --> 01:49:16.165
He started living with
another woman dumping his wife.

01:49:16.611 --> 01:49:19.102
And after the woman
dumped him he came back.

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.841
And sister-in-law is
not accepting him.

01:49:22.183 --> 01:49:25.914
So it is my duty to convince
sister-in-law. - Why only you?

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:29.112
It is because only
I can talk to her.

01:49:29.323 --> 01:49:32.349
You're quarrelling with me
because of other's tensions?

01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.061
I'm not quarrelling and
this is not only issue.

01:49:37.298 --> 01:49:43.999
Six months ago, I'd given1
million to papa for investment..

01:49:44.672 --> 01:49:47.368
And..
- And?

01:49:50.144 --> 01:49:51.406
All the money has gone?

01:49:51.646 --> 01:49:56.743
No. He went through loss.
Something like that.

01:49:57.351 --> 01:49:59.114
You are telling about it now?

01:49:59.187 --> 01:50:01.212
Tell you and do what?

01:50:02.123 --> 01:50:03.886
Then why I am here?

01:50:04.158 --> 01:50:06.888
Too cook for you?
To sleep with you?

01:50:07.695 --> 01:50:09.424
You gave your father 1 million..

01:50:09.697 --> 01:50:11.756
..and you never felt
the need to inform me?

01:50:11.833 --> 01:50:14.301
Neha, it is he who's been investing
my money right from the beginning.

01:50:14.335 --> 01:50:16.098
Things change, Rajat.

01:50:16.170 --> 01:50:18.070
We've not been living
together right from the beginning.

01:50:18.139 --> 01:50:20.937
Neha, he money has gone.
What's the point doing all this?

01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:23.673
Nothing will happen.
There's no need to do anything.

01:50:23.744 --> 01:50:27.339
Do one thing. Give him more
money and don't tell me about it.

01:50:28.783 --> 01:50:30.910
Just go to hell.

01:50:36.057 --> 01:50:39.288
Yes, Vanita, I'm currently
working on Soft Solutions. Right.

01:50:40.261 --> 01:50:43.890
Yes. Reason I seek a
place in E.C. S is..

01:50:45.099 --> 01:50:49.001
Yes. The reason is.. E.C. S is..

01:50:50.137 --> 01:50:52.230
Vanita, I'm sorry. Can I call you
back in five minutes?

01:50:52.306 --> 01:50:54.069
I'm getting this
really important phone call.

01:50:54.141 --> 01:50:55.870
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

01:50:56.944 --> 01:51:01.938
Hello. - Nishant, you think one will
die drinking one glass pesticide?

01:51:02.416 --> 01:51:05.783
What? What happened,
Charu? What are you saying?

01:51:06.053 --> 01:51:09.750
Nothing. You must be busy in the
office, isn't it? Let's talk later.

01:51:09.824 --> 01:51:12.122
No, I'm not busy.
Just listen.. Charu?

01:51:16.697 --> 01:51:18.358
Sector, 50. Hurry up.

01:51:25.306 --> 01:51:27.069
Are you okay?

01:51:27.174 --> 01:51:31.770
Of course. I am fine. You think
I'll commit suicide for some idiot?

01:51:33.681 --> 01:51:35.171
Did you again fight with Abhijeet?

01:51:35.249 --> 01:51:38.047
Nishant, there is no need
for you to care about me.

01:51:38.619 --> 01:51:41.884
You have interviews coming up,
isn't it? Go and prepare yourself.

01:51:42.089 --> 01:51:43.647
I can stay alone.

01:51:49.931 --> 01:51:51.865
Hello, Riya.
- Yes, I'll call you back.

01:51:51.933 --> 01:51:54.128
It's him, right?
- Where are you?

01:51:54.201 --> 01:51:55.998
I will call you back. Okay?

01:53:06.207 --> 01:53:09.040
You.. When did you come?

01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:10.777
A while ago.

01:53:10.845 --> 01:53:12.710
Neha's parents were sitting and..

01:53:14.115 --> 01:53:15.707
How was your interview?

01:53:17.218 --> 01:53:18.685
Couldn't complete it.

01:53:19.754 --> 01:53:20.914
Why?

01:53:21.355 --> 01:53:22.913
Charu called.

01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:24.352
Is everything all right?

01:53:24.625 --> 01:53:26.286
She was talking about consuming
pesticide over the phone.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.056
Why?
- She would've fought with Abhijeet.

01:53:29.230 --> 01:53:31.824
So you gave up the interview?
- My interview was on..

01:53:31.866 --> 01:53:33.800
..but she keep calling constantly.

01:53:33.834 --> 01:53:36.359
And after she talked about
consuming pesticide, I..

01:53:36.771 --> 01:53:39.604
Is everything all right now?
- Yes. She didn't consume.

01:53:39.673 --> 01:53:41.834
You left the interview
because of her?

01:53:42.777 --> 01:53:45.644
What else could I do?
What if she really consumed it?

01:53:45.713 --> 01:53:47.908
She wouldn't have called you
if she really wanted to consume.

01:53:47.982 --> 01:53:49.643
And you wouldn't have even
known that she's consumed it.

01:53:49.717 --> 01:53:51.685
It is not Abhijeet, but you're mad.

01:53:51.752 --> 01:53:53.049
Choudhary, what are you doing?

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:55.247
Ask him what is he doing?

01:53:55.623 --> 01:53:58.285
What am I doing?
- You're getting fooled by her.

01:53:58.359 --> 01:54:01.658
Then what are you doing? Answer me.

01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:04.197
Charu doesn't love me..

01:54:04.265 --> 01:54:05.892
..so that she has to
be committed to me.

01:54:05.966 --> 01:54:07.126
But your girl is in
touch with her ex-boyfriend..

01:54:07.201 --> 01:54:08.930
..in spite of committing to you.

01:54:09.003 --> 01:54:10.732
Isn't your fault visible to you?

01:54:14.909 --> 01:54:17.400
What's going on? Choudhary..

01:54:26.387 --> 01:54:27.877
What have you decided?

01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:32.216
Decided?
- About Varun.

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:36.687
Vicky, please don't ruin the evening.
Let's not talk about it.

01:54:36.764 --> 01:54:38.789
Not talking about it
doesn't resolve issue.

01:54:42.069 --> 01:54:43.696
Yesterday, you were with Varun.

01:54:45.406 --> 01:54:46.805
Yes.

01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:49.337
Why?

01:54:49.443 --> 01:54:53.880
You tell me why. Because
I needed someone to sleep with.

01:54:56.917 --> 01:55:01.980
Vicky.. because I want
to solve the problem..

01:55:02.356 --> 01:55:04.290
..and I went there for the same.

01:55:06.293 --> 01:55:07.726
Please.

01:55:11.232 --> 01:55:15.259
Well, there's my friend's
birthday party tomorrow night.

01:55:15.402 --> 01:55:16.892
Will you come along with me?

01:55:18.005 --> 01:55:23.341
No. - Vicky, it's been days
since we spent good time together.

01:55:24.245 --> 01:55:28.181
Come on. I promise
I'll put an end to this.

01:55:28.682 --> 01:55:30.809
I myself wish the same thing.

01:55:31.318 --> 01:55:32.717
Please.

01:55:35.823 --> 01:55:36.949
Okay.

01:56:02.183 --> 01:56:04.242
It's you?

01:56:04.451 --> 01:56:06.885
It's Nishant. So, shall I leave?

01:56:07.154 --> 01:56:08.951
Did I ask you to leave?

01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:12.254
Hi. You must be Abhijeet.

01:56:13.027 --> 01:56:14.756
How often does he come here?

01:56:14.828 --> 01:56:15.920
He's never come here.

01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:17.725
He only drops me at
the gate sometimes.

01:56:17.831 --> 01:56:20.129
Then he must also be coming
inside the house sometimes.

01:56:20.401 --> 01:56:21.834
Why are you talking like this?

01:56:21.869 --> 01:56:23.734
Listen, you. Stay out of it.

01:56:23.904 --> 01:56:26.168
I'm talking to my girlfriend,
not you.

01:56:26.674 --> 01:56:28.403
Still, how can?
- Nishant, quiet.

01:56:28.676 --> 01:56:31.770
Charu, there's a way to talk..
- Nishant, shut up.

01:56:31.845 --> 01:56:33.335
Who asked you to come here?

01:56:33.414 --> 01:56:35.245
Just stay out of it and leave.

01:56:35.316 --> 01:56:37.807
Go from here.
Don't create more problems.

01:56:38.085 --> 01:56:40.076
Leave. Come on.

01:56:45.059 --> 01:56:48.893
Uncle Mehta's son Chirag,
he's talking about him.

01:56:49.096 --> 01:56:50.791
Well, he's handsome.

01:56:50.864 --> 01:56:52.092
But what do I do?

01:56:52.166 --> 01:56:55.158
Now that I'm
committed to you I told him.

01:56:56.303 --> 01:56:57.770
Listen, father is calling me.

01:56:58.239 --> 01:57:01.697
And tomorrow get ready
well and behave nicely. Bye.

01:57:02.176 --> 01:57:03.871
Chirag is waiting for me.

01:57:04.378 --> 01:57:05.902
Bye. Love you.

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:08.079
I love you, too.

01:57:15.389 --> 01:57:18.881
Let's meet your parents.

01:57:18.959 --> 01:57:22.725
Now that you've decided,
let's talk to them.

01:57:22.796 --> 01:57:26.027
We believe in things which
make our children happy.

01:57:26.734 --> 01:57:29.999
We told Neha several
times to go to Bangalore..

01:57:30.304 --> 01:57:34.035
..but she was interested to be
away from us and we said okay.

01:57:34.408 --> 01:57:37.206
But now, we feel that
children should stay with us..

01:57:37.678 --> 01:57:39.407
..but she doesn't listen.

01:57:39.813 --> 01:57:42.805
Uncle, Neha is very
intelligent girl.

01:57:42.883 --> 01:57:46.649
Definitely, but a little guidance,
there's no harm.

01:57:47.087 --> 01:57:51.421
She was telling yesterday
you got some investment done..

01:57:52.393 --> 01:57:56.420
..and your father
who's a nave man suffered loss.

01:57:57.865 --> 01:58:00.891
Yes uncle, my father is very nave.

01:58:01.435 --> 01:58:03.232
And he has become lonely as well.

01:58:03.971 --> 01:58:09.238
As I am his only son
I've decided to call him here.

01:58:10.244 --> 01:58:14.681
Even he tells the same thing,
children should stay with parents.

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:21.610
Did you ask for the bill?

01:58:27.995 --> 01:58:29.189
Oh, really?

01:58:30.230 --> 01:58:31.390
Hi.

01:58:31.832 --> 01:58:33.891
Everyone, that's Vicky.

01:58:33.967 --> 01:58:35.366
Vicky, everyone.
- Hi, Vicky.

01:58:35.402 --> 01:58:36.960
Hi.
- By the way, guys.

01:58:37.037 --> 01:58:40.302
Today, I did something
to improve my waistline.

01:58:42.142 --> 01:58:45.134
Wow.
- Nice. V for Varun?

01:58:46.313 --> 01:58:47.974
V for Vikrant.

01:58:48.215 --> 01:58:51.150
Okay. You know Riya is
looking very beautiful.

01:58:51.218 --> 01:58:53.209
But you are wearing the wrong top.

01:58:54.355 --> 01:58:56.220
What's the need to
hide the waistline?

01:58:56.290 --> 01:59:00.158
That's right. Let people
know about Vikrant's hard work.

01:59:00.661 --> 01:59:04.688
If I show Vikrant's hard
work you would feel shy.

01:59:05.966 --> 01:59:09.663
By the way, even I've worked
hard on that waistline. - What?

01:59:10.237 --> 01:59:12.728
Did you forget how many times
I've taken you out for lunch?

01:59:12.806 --> 01:59:14.364
You're such a darling.

01:59:18.879 --> 01:59:20.779
This is for your hard work.

01:59:21.382 --> 01:59:23.213
Anyone else left?

01:59:23.283 --> 01:59:24.978
You never gave
a chance to work hard.

01:59:25.052 --> 01:59:27.043
If I sit to
calculate such a hard work..

01:59:27.121 --> 01:59:29.385
..I'll have many payments pending.

01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:31.382
I wish you continue.

01:59:45.639 --> 01:59:47.004
I was calling you.

01:59:48.242 --> 01:59:49.641
Why?

01:59:49.943 --> 01:59:53.174
Because I was
worried and wanted to talk.

01:59:53.380 --> 01:59:56.247
Nishant, Abhijeet is
there to care for me.

01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:58.941
I saw how much he cares for you.

02:00:00.154 --> 02:00:02.418
Can't you tell him for once
on phone that you're fine?

02:00:03.023 --> 02:00:05.184
The way he was talking
to you I felt like..

02:00:05.259 --> 02:00:06.851
Why don't you understand?

02:00:06.927 --> 02:00:09.418
I didn't answer your call as
I didn't want to talk to you.

02:00:11.999 --> 02:00:14.024
Shall we go to the cafÃ© and talk?

02:00:14.101 --> 02:00:17.036
I don't want to go anywhere and
I don't want to talk with you.

02:00:17.271 --> 02:00:19.796
Who are you to interfere
between Abhijeet and me?

02:00:20.174 --> 02:00:22.165
I made you my friend
inspite of you proposing me.

02:00:22.242 --> 02:00:25.109
Because I befriended you..

02:00:25.179 --> 02:00:27.875
..you thought you can create
difference between me and Abhijeet?

02:00:28.382 --> 02:00:30.043
But Charu, I didn't
have such intentions.

02:00:30.117 --> 02:00:31.209
I just didn't like the way he was..

02:00:31.285 --> 02:00:34.982
Who are you to like it or not
like it? Actually, it is my fault.

02:00:35.255 --> 02:00:37.883
You're not worth of befriending.

02:00:38.659 --> 02:00:41.651
A girl befriends you, talks to you
and you try to take advantage of it.

02:00:41.995 --> 02:00:43.792
Don't you have
your own life to live?

02:00:45.999 --> 02:00:49.958
Listen. I know you're
venting Abhijeet's anger on me.

02:00:51.405 --> 02:00:54.670
I don't believe it.
After listening to all this..

02:00:55.275 --> 02:00:56.902
You're such a loser.

02:00:57.277 --> 02:01:01.145
Listen. I'm telling you
what I feel about you.

02:01:02.216 --> 02:01:04.878
If you think you will
create differences between me..

02:01:04.952 --> 02:01:07.944
..and Abhi just to
get me then forget it.

02:01:08.856 --> 02:01:13.225
Even if Abhi and I breakup, I will
never hookup with a guy like you.

02:01:14.995 --> 02:01:16.292
You think you're worth it?

02:01:16.697 --> 02:01:17.994
I mean, look at yourself.

02:01:18.165 --> 02:01:20.725
You follow me like
a dog the entire day.

02:01:20.968 --> 02:01:23.698
You want to be a dog?
Go lick someone else.

02:01:27.708 --> 02:01:29.369
Now, go away from here.

02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:31.641
You've created a scene.

02:01:31.778 --> 02:01:34.303
As it is, no one here respects you,
I don't want to lose mine.

02:01:35.082 --> 02:01:36.879
So leave me alone.

02:01:59.039 --> 02:02:04.671
Why didn't you tell me
you're bringing your parents here?

02:02:06.079 --> 02:02:08.707
Don't I have the right to
know about your future plans?

02:02:09.082 --> 02:02:13.212
You have the right only when
you don't disclose about it.

02:02:16.323 --> 02:02:18.985
Rajat, if you tell me
you will not be in loss..

02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:22.158
..and you gave 1 million rupees
to your father without asking me.

02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:24.356
He had no sense and
all the money has gone.

02:02:25.699 --> 02:02:26.893
Stop the taxi.

02:02:29.670 --> 02:02:30.864
Rajat.

02:02:30.904 --> 02:02:33.668
What the.. Rajat. Rajat.

02:02:35.375 --> 02:02:36.808
Move!

02:04:12.105 --> 02:04:13.333
Yes, tell me.

02:04:13.774 --> 02:04:16.800
Hello. Rajat.

02:04:18.111 --> 02:04:23.811
Liquid? Where are you?

02:04:25.052 --> 02:04:26.314
I am coming.

02:04:29.723 --> 02:04:33.750
I haven't seen you for so long.
I was.. - Riya, I need to go.

02:04:33.827 --> 02:04:36.227
What happened?
- It's about Liquid.

02:04:36.296 --> 02:04:39.663
Shall we go?
- You go. I'll manage.

02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:41.224
Riya, see that. It is so nice.
- I'll manage.

02:04:41.268 --> 02:04:43.099
Oh wow. That exactly looks fine.

02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:45.434
I don't even
understand how these people..

02:05:15.736 --> 02:05:18.034
Did he sleep?
- Yes.

02:05:20.273 --> 02:05:23.731
I feel like going to
Charu's house and slapping her.

02:05:24.745 --> 02:05:26.804
What difference will it make?

02:05:34.788 --> 02:05:37.188
This is what happens with girls
in long distance relationships.

02:05:37.424 --> 02:05:39.892
They have boyfriends
who live far away.

02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.985
They always need someone's support.

02:05:42.929 --> 02:05:44.863
They don't disclose
anything to their boyfriends..

02:05:45.031 --> 02:05:47.226
..at the same time they also
give importance to friends..

02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:48.426
..and create scenes.

02:05:49.269 --> 02:05:51.100
They will breakup
with their boyfriends

02:05:51.171 --> 02:05:53.799
..and then friends
become their boyfriends..

02:05:53.874 --> 02:05:55.273
..and friends will be in trouble.

02:05:55.909 --> 02:05:57.206
It doesn't make
any difference to them.

02:05:57.277 --> 02:05:59.177
They always have an option.

02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:01.743
Liquid is a fool.

02:06:02.282 --> 02:06:04.876
Wonder what was on his mind.

02:06:09.289 --> 02:06:11.154
It is so strange, isn't it?

02:06:12.692 --> 02:06:14.717
Did you ever think Liquid
would fall in serious love..

02:06:14.895 --> 02:06:17.261
..and come to this state?

02:06:18.098 --> 02:06:20.157
There are many things
which I never thought about.

02:06:56.403 --> 02:06:58.200
I don't think it can work anymore.

02:06:58.271 --> 02:07:00.205
I guess my parents were right.

02:07:00.273 --> 02:07:01.865
It was my fault.

02:07:02.175 --> 02:07:04.803
I just called father and
told I'm ready to meet Chirag.

02:07:04.878 --> 02:07:06.436
I'm meeting him tomorrow.

02:07:35.675 --> 02:07:37.074
Neha!

02:07:44.718 --> 02:07:45.912
Neha!

02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:26.788
With Chirag. Loving it.
Don't disturb.

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:49.808
Just reached home.
It was amazing.

02:08:58.091 --> 02:09:01.686
You? What are you doing here?

02:09:12.706 --> 02:09:16.073
Chirag appreciated your choice..

02:09:17.143 --> 02:09:20.306
Rajat, you remember this dress?
You presented this to me.

02:09:22.248 --> 02:09:23.647
He loved it.

02:09:30.657 --> 02:09:32.056
I want to change.

02:10:06.893 --> 02:10:10.329
You know, after a long
time I had a good time.

02:10:11.197 --> 02:10:13.097
I feel so alive.

02:10:13.633 --> 02:10:15.999
I think whatever happened
was good.

02:10:16.836 --> 02:10:18.667
I think this was bound to happen.

02:10:18.738 --> 02:10:21.764
Neha.
- He picked me from my house.

02:10:22.842 --> 02:10:25.606
The way he put his arm
around me when we entered.

02:10:26.212 --> 02:10:28.271
He even pulled the chair for me.

02:10:29.716 --> 02:10:33.846
I mean.. I don't even remember
when you had treated me so nicely.

02:10:34.387 --> 02:10:38.790
But you know.. today the
way he behaved with me..

02:10:38.858 --> 02:10:41.019
..I felt good about myself.

02:10:42.829 --> 02:10:46.697
The way he kissed me
while dropping me.

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:50.369
I had never thought
such thing would happen.

02:10:51.137 --> 02:10:53.264
He just leaned in and..

02:10:54.674 --> 02:10:56.232
I felt so good.

02:10:58.912 --> 02:11:01.904
I don't remember when was the last
time I felt like that with you.

02:11:02.982 --> 02:11:04.847
Why are you doing this?

02:11:05.351 --> 02:11:08.718
I know you are telling
this to make me feel jealous.

02:11:08.788 --> 02:11:10.415
What's the need to say all this?

02:11:10.657 --> 02:11:15.754
No Rajat, to tell you the truth.
I was angry with you.

02:11:16.296 --> 02:11:18.355
But now I don't have
anything against you.

02:11:18.932 --> 02:11:20.866
I was just telling
you what all happened.

02:11:20.934 --> 02:11:22.629
I know all this is lie. Please.

02:11:22.702 --> 02:11:25.762
Please, tell me it is a lie.

02:11:27.707 --> 02:11:32.872
Rajat, stop behaving like children.

02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:36.712
Rajat, what are you doing?

02:11:39.219 --> 02:11:42.188
It makes no difference, Rajat.

02:11:43.356 --> 02:11:47.019
Rajat, when there is nothing between
us, then this was bound to happen.

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:50.295
I'll move on. You'll move on.

02:11:53.933 --> 02:11:56.925
Assume, even if something happens
between us..

02:11:58.104 --> 02:12:02.404
..then one date and one kiss
is not a big deal for you.

02:12:03.843 --> 02:12:06.334
You had explained this to
your sister-in-law, isn't it?

02:12:08.014 --> 02:12:10.209
To go back to your brother.

02:12:10.283 --> 02:12:13.719
Whereas he had a relationship with
another woman for almost a year.

02:12:15.054 --> 02:12:16.817
Then why are you?

02:12:30.904 --> 02:12:32.337
Why do you do like this?

02:12:35.308 --> 02:12:37.640
Why do you trouble me?

02:12:40.146 --> 02:12:42.842
I don't have fun
doing all this with you.

02:12:44.217 --> 02:12:45.707
Rajat, even you have to realize..

02:12:45.785 --> 02:12:48.811
..what can be the consequences of
what you are doing.

02:12:53.326 --> 02:12:55.123
Stop crying.

02:12:57.096 --> 02:12:58.825
I didn't go anywhere.

02:13:00.033 --> 02:13:04.094
I was with Aarti.
I was messaging you from there.

02:13:06.339 --> 02:13:08.807
Did you realize now?

02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:11.301
I had to do it.

02:13:12.045 --> 02:13:13.808
You made me do it.

02:13:15.348 --> 02:13:18.010
You know how much I love you,
but still?

02:13:20.954 --> 02:13:22.945
Stop crying. Calm down.

02:13:23.790 --> 02:13:25.121
Calm down.

02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:29.350
Stop crying, dear.

02:13:34.801 --> 02:13:36.359
Stop crying.

02:14:38.064 --> 02:14:40.828
Is there anything you want
to tell me about last night?

02:14:42.802 --> 02:14:45.794
Why are you asking?
- Just like that.

02:14:50.143 --> 02:14:55.080
I don't know how to say this, but..

02:14:56.449 --> 02:15:00.886
Last night after you left
Varun came to the party.

02:15:01.354 --> 02:15:04.721
And then.. he dropped me home.

02:15:09.329 --> 02:15:10.819
And then..

02:15:10.897 --> 02:15:13.365
Riya, we both were
happy together, aren't we?

02:15:13.766 --> 02:15:16.360
How do I tell you?
I don't love you anymore.

02:15:16.402 --> 02:15:18.165
I love Vikrant.

02:15:44.697 --> 02:15:46.096
He was crying like children.

02:15:46.132 --> 02:15:48.657
I just wanted to tell him
that I care for him.

02:15:49.235 --> 02:15:51.863
Vikrant, it meant nothing to me.

02:15:52.405 --> 02:15:56.341
In fact, I was not sure about you.
About us.. that I love you.

02:15:57.076 --> 02:16:00.409
Vick.. oh don't be
such a brute, Vikrant!

02:16:00.446 --> 02:16:03.779
We were together for five years.
As if we never slept together.

02:16:03.850 --> 02:16:05.909
What difference does
one night make?

02:16:32.245 --> 02:16:36.739
''Life is..

02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:42.250
..saying something.''

02:16:56.002 --> 02:16:59.802
''Life is..

02:17:01.707 --> 02:17:06.144
..saying something.''

02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:11.616
''Life is..

02:17:13.386 --> 02:17:17.049
..flowing silently.''

02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:27.866
''O fool, listen to me.''

02:17:27.933 --> 02:17:33.736
''O fool, listen to me.''

02:17:34.106 --> 02:17:42.343
''O fool, listen to me at least.''

02:17:45.951 --> 02:17:52.357
''This is a strange
cobweb of dreams.''

02:17:54.826 --> 02:18:00.322
''O fool, stitch it.''

02:18:00.398 --> 02:18:08.431
''O fool, listen to me at least.''

02:18:47.847 --> 02:18:50.975
''Whatever I had,
I gave it to you.''

02:18:51.049 --> 02:18:56.147
''Every way and every path..

02:18:56.222 --> 02:18:59.749
..of mine comes to you.''

02:19:05.698 --> 02:19:10.795
''Whatever I had,
I gave it to you.''

02:19:11.037 --> 02:19:14.268
''Every way and every path..

02:19:14.373 --> 02:19:17.240
..of mine comes to you.''

02:19:17.610 --> 02:19:19.840
''Stop for two minutes.''

02:19:20.379 --> 02:19:22.973
''Cry out.''

02:19:23.215 --> 02:19:26.150
''You've waited a long..''

02:19:26.218 --> 02:19:29.380
''You've endured a lot.''

02:19:29.621 --> 02:19:34.924
''Pick the flowers from..

02:19:35.294 --> 02:19:40.129
..the ashes of the memories.''

02:19:43.869 --> 02:19:46.895
''O fool!''

02:19:49.709 --> 02:19:52.303
''O fool!''

02:19:56.048 --> 02:20:03.284
''O fool, listen to me at least.''

02:20:04.690 --> 02:20:10.219
''Listen to me at least.''

02:20:14.166 --> 02:20:18.967
''O fool!''

02:20:27.146 --> 02:20:31.708
''Listen to me at least.''

02:20:38.791 --> 02:20:39.985
Bye, Neha

02:20:41.694 --> 02:20:42.922
Where are you going?

02:20:42.995 --> 02:20:44.656
Home.
- What?

02:20:46.399 --> 02:20:48.026
You know, Rajat.
- I know.

02:20:48.901 --> 02:20:50.892
I don't want it to work anymore.

02:20:50.970 --> 02:20:52.699
You've gone mad.

02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:57.371
You go,
but don't come weeping later.

02:21:06.152 --> 02:21:08.985
Let's talk about it.
Let's sit. We'll talk.

02:21:09.055 --> 02:21:12.957
Let's talk about it, Rajat!
What happened?

02:21:14.794 --> 02:21:17.262
Nothing. Nothing at all.

02:21:18.030 --> 02:21:23.195
Stop, Rajat! Stop Rajat!

02:21:28.074 --> 02:21:32.272
Rajat! You sit here.

02:21:32.344 --> 02:21:35.836
Rajat, wait. Rajat!

02:21:36.148 --> 02:21:38.343
Rajat! Rajat!

02:21:38.951 --> 02:21:42.045
Rajat!

02:21:45.024 --> 02:21:46.116
Rajat!

02:21:46.258 --> 02:21:48.158
Rajat! Why?

02:21:50.796 --> 02:21:52.093
Why?

02:21:54.667 --> 02:21:56.294
Because you are not right.

02:23:30.863 --> 02:23:32.023
What?

02:24:18.677 --> 02:24:20.770
To hell with this.

02:24:48.874 --> 02:24:50.171
The thing is..

02:24:50.342 --> 02:24:53.436
..when a girl makes you her best
friend and weeps on your shoulder..

02:24:53.712 --> 02:24:56.044
..then one gets confused
what to do.

02:24:56.215 --> 02:25:01.312
Her space, freedom, and individuality
everything support it.

02:25:01.387 --> 02:25:04.720
Only the guy becomes a fool
and doesn't understand.

02:25:05.291 --> 02:25:10.126
You understand it only when
she shifts from his lap to yours.

02:25:10.696 --> 02:25:14.393
Then you understand that guy
was right and we were fools.

02:25:19.972 --> 02:25:23.100
But I didn't understand one thing.

02:25:24.209 --> 02:25:25.733
Why did you hit him?

02:25:27.046 --> 02:25:30.311
I had to hit him.
- But why?

02:25:31.650 --> 02:25:33.117
I had to hit him.

02:25:33.419 --> 02:25:37.822
You hit him, isn't it? Now drink.

02:25:40.059 --> 02:25:41.390
Yes.

02:25:42.328 --> 02:25:44.421
Cheers!
- Cheers! - Cheers!

02:25:55.107 --> 02:25:57.041
I slapped him correctly, didn't I?

02:25:57.409 --> 02:26:00.674
He would remember it all his life.

02:26:04.049 --> 02:26:06.017
''And I say.''

02:26:06.251 --> 02:26:08.082
Bitch.

02:26:09.955 --> 02:26:12.822
Bitch.

02:26:14.393 --> 02:26:17.920
What is it? Go back to sleep.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.797
Hey, Choudhary.

02:27:00.839 --> 02:27:04.707
''The boy agreed.
He's become a dog.''

02:27:04.777 --> 02:27:08.235
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

02:27:08.313 --> 02:27:11.942
''The boy agreed.
He's become a dog.''

02:27:12.017 --> 02:27:15.350
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

02:27:15.387 --> 02:27:20.723
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

02:27:21.026 --> 02:27:26.293
''The eyes became small and the tail
was decorated with golden paper.''

02:27:26.698 --> 02:27:29.997
''What situation I've fallen into?''

02:27:30.069 --> 02:27:34.028
''I became old in youthful days.''

02:27:34.073 --> 02:27:37.736
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

02:27:37.810 --> 02:27:41.371
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

02:27:41.413 --> 02:27:45.213
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

02:27:45.284 --> 02:27:49.983
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

02:27:56.361 --> 02:27:59.888
''You fool, listen to me.''

02:27:59.965 --> 02:28:03.696
''You'll ruin yourself.
Listen to me.''

02:28:03.836 --> 02:28:07.272
''You are a donkey.''

02:28:07.339 --> 02:28:12.242
''Listen to me or go to hell.''

02:28:19.284 --> 02:28:22.378
''They threw a bone..''

02:28:22.654 --> 02:28:25.714
''They soaked the
rolled bread in the milk.''

02:28:25.791 --> 02:28:29.249
''She loved me and
called me lovingly.''

02:28:29.328 --> 02:28:33.264
''She loved me and
called me lovingly.''

02:28:33.332 --> 02:28:37.268
''You thought..

02:28:37.336 --> 02:28:40.794
..it is love and you are her God.''

02:28:40.873 --> 02:28:44.172
''When the doorbell rang.
Her boyfriend Bunty entered inside.''

02:28:44.243 --> 02:28:47.940
''You tried to run, but she
said you are best friend.''

02:28:48.013 --> 02:28:51.642
''She gestured me with her eyes
and brought a collar immediately.''

02:28:51.717 --> 02:28:55.244
''She kissed me on my
forehead and embraced me.''

02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:58.949
''You became happy and
started wagging your tail.''

02:28:59.057 --> 02:29:02.652
''She tied you in the
corner and slept with Bunty.''

02:29:02.728 --> 02:29:06.289
''You were sitting there and watching.
He was unveiling her.''

02:29:06.365 --> 02:29:09.857
''He was having a good time.''

02:29:09.935 --> 02:29:13.598
''He was having a good time.
She was darn sweet.''

02:29:13.672 --> 02:29:15.867
''He was having a good time.
- Wow.''

02:29:16.074 --> 02:29:19.874
''He took the note from you..

02:29:20.212 --> 02:29:23.773
..and gave you change.''

02:29:24.616 --> 02:29:30.282
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

02:29:30.355 --> 02:29:34.257
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''

02:29:34.326 --> 02:29:37.921
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:41.625
''I've put collar on my neck
and have become a dog.''

02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:46.362
''The boy agreed. He became a dog.''
