00:40.512 --> 00:42.911
Let go!

00:45.569 --> 00:49.056
- Oh, my...
- God! No!

00:49.920 --> 00:52.256
- Now, get up!
- No!

00:52.767 --> 00:56.928
No.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.169
Please! No, please! No, no!

01:17.631 --> 01:21.663
- You're not finished.
- No. No, please.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.463
There are no pleases here.
We had a deal. Remember?

01:27.360 --> 01:30.368
I dictated the terms,
you named your price,

01:30.497 --> 01:33.600
and then you willingly
committed murder.

01:35.871 --> 01:37.855
While this has provided me
a brief reprieve

01:38.048 --> 01:40.128
on an otherwise banal Tuesday,

01:40.256 --> 01:43.296
you still
have one final obligation.

01:44.801 --> 01:47.169
Also, something tells me
those crocodile tears

01:47.295 --> 01:48.800
are going to dry
right up the second

01:48.928 --> 01:51.199
you walk out of here
and start spending.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.240
I mean, for people like you,
that's a given.

01:55.264 --> 01:57.824
Now, come on, you can do it.

02:39.456 --> 02:41.087
Put it where it belongs.

03:05.664 --> 03:09.216
On the ground.

03:10.304 --> 03:13.312
Now, see,
that was not so hard, was it?

03:27.648 --> 03:29.087
Clean her up,
give her the money,

03:29.215 --> 03:32.384
and get her
the fuck outta here. Jesus.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.712
Mainstream.
No more of this reality shit.

05:58.976 --> 06:00.767

06:02.048 --> 06:03.200
These guys asked
for you by name.

06:03.392 --> 06:04.961
- Why? Because of Darla?
- Who cares?

06:05.088 --> 06:07.648
You and Darla did a show
together. People know your face.

06:07.776 --> 06:09.216
People hate my face.

06:09.343 --> 06:10.560

06:10.688 --> 06:12.704

This time it's about you.
It's redemption time.

06:18.784 --> 06:21.536
I think it sounds
pretty sketchy to me.

07:12.352 --> 07:13.920
Hello, mate.
What's the craic with you?

07:14.559 --> 07:16.479
Hey. What happened?

07:16.992 --> 07:18.848
How come everyone says that
when they come out here?

07:19.008 --> 07:21.024
What kind of show is this?
They drugged us.

07:21.248 --> 07:23.328
Woke up me fucking skivvies,
some voice on high saying,

07:23.456 --> 07:24.832
"Get changed
and proceed to the common room."

07:24.960 --> 07:26.528
These people are getting so sued
believe you me.

07:26.656 --> 07:28.320
You've never been
drugged before?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.848
Yeah, but of my own volition,
and at my own discretion,

07:31.040 --> 07:32.192
and not in this outfit.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.568
What have they done
with me clothes?

07:33.759 --> 07:35.776
They choose our clothes,
that was in the contract.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.376
Well,
at least give me some variety.

07:37.536 --> 07:38.687
Spice of fucking life.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.280
Not the same
ten quim-pink shirts every day.

07:41.888 --> 07:44.319
- Slainte!
- Wh... where are we?

07:44.447 --> 07:46.048
Welcome

07:46.176 --> 07:48.736
Hello? Anyone in charge?

07:48.896 --> 07:51.616
I'm pretty sure kidnapping
is illegal, yeah?

07:52.959 --> 07:54.496
He's tried this
three times already.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.184
- Yo, mate, nobody's coming.
- Get fucked.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.936
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

08:00.928 --> 08:02.336
I didn't know.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.984
I said, "What the fuck
did you just say to me?"

08:06.176 --> 08:08.352
Sorry, mate, I am, uh,
clinically claustrophobic.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.264

Fucking legendary.

08:19.456 --> 08:21.216
- Is there a phone?
- No phones.

08:21.408 --> 08:23.200
Took our mobiles as well.
So, you can kiss

08:23.328 --> 08:25.408
that social media hot streak
goodbye.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.656
It's all in the contract.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.064
What's the last thing
you remember?

08:28.192 --> 08:29.567
Getting in the limo
after the airport

08:29.696 --> 08:30.976
and then...
...lights out.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.631
- Woke up here.
- Yeah. Ditto.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.232
And you lot are all right

08:35.392 --> 08:36.736
Wow, you've never
been knocked out before?

08:36.928 --> 08:39.808
- You'll be fine, man.
- Fucking mental.

08:40.544 --> 08:42.592
For five million quid,
I'm all right with it, mate.

08:43.583 --> 08:45.887
- Do you want a drink?
- Uh, yeah.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.816
I know you.
Yeah, you're that guy.

Amigos, good news.
We found a hot tub.

09:25.728 --> 09:28.864
Yeah. And it's filled with milk.
It's fucking weird.

09:29.087 --> 09:30.272

- <i>Yes, Nevin?</i>
- Uh, oh, yeah, Furcas, is it?

16:44.991 --> 16:46.815
Yeah, you gave us

16:46.944 --> 16:48.831
- What's that all about?
- <i>That was agreed upon</i>

16:48.960 --> 16:50.815
<i>in your contract. Section 32 C.</i>

16:50.943 --> 16:51.807
I fucking told you.

16:52.001 --> 16:53.216
Yeah. We're not allowed outside.

16:53.376 --> 16:55.329
I'm claustrophobic, you know,
clinically.

16:55.455 --> 16:56.768
<i>So I've heard.</i>

16:56.928 --> 16:58.817
<i>The contract
clearly dictated the terms.</i>

16:58.944 --> 17:01.440
<i>You're confined to the interior
of the house.</i>

17:01.664 --> 17:04.095
<i>If you leave at any time,
you'll be disqualified</i>

17:04.223 --> 17:07.520

Okay. What about the cameras?
Are they in the bathroom?

17:13.824 --> 17:16.031
<i>The cameras are hidden
throughout the house.</i>

17:16.160 --> 17:18.048
<i>And while using
the bathroom or shower,</i>

17:18.175 --> 17:20.128
<i>your image will be blurred

17:20.351 --> 17:23.583
<i>However, if you so choose,

17:23.712 --> 17:26.079

17:26.913 --> 17:29.247
<i>Once a day,

17:29.377 --> 17:30.911
<i>you must enter

17:31.040 --> 17:34.337
<i>and speak to our viewers

17:34.496 --> 17:35.744
<i>Other than that,</i>

Don't be creeping like that.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.888
<i>Occasionally,
you'll see helpers</i>

17:42.017 --> 17:43.777
<i>such as this

17:44.064 --> 17:46.560
<i>They're here to clean,

17:46.721 --> 17:48.384
<i>and guide you

17:48.608 --> 17:50.175
<i>You can speak to them
if you wish,</i>

17:50.304 --> 17:53.184
<i>but they will not answer.
They are here only to help.</i>

17:53.984 --> 17:56.704
<i>Then if there are no further
questions, good luck,</i>

17:56.831 --> 17:59.839
<i>and enjoy your stay
at Furcas's House of Fun.</i>

18:03.424 --> 18:06.559

18:07.744 --> 18:09.439
Right. Who wants a drink?

18:12.672 --> 18:14.049
- Yes.
- Make it double.

So, you're from Boston, huh?

21:18.368 --> 21:21.216
I'm from Grand Rapids,
Michigan, originally.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.327
Went to Boston U
for four years, though.

21:23.872 --> 21:24.768
What did you take?

21:25.247 --> 21:29.216
I am the proud owner of a degree
in Elizabethan literature.

21:29.408 --> 21:31.361
Oh, wow. That's cool.

21:31.871 --> 21:33.855
Cool if you want
a Shakespeare quote.

21:34.304 --> 21:37.216
Not so cool if you want a job
that pays actual money.

21:37.568 --> 21:40.032
Seems to be a lot
of that going around here.

21:41.696 --> 21:44.193
So you are the bride-to-be.

21:44.351 --> 21:46.176
That's my claim to fame.

21:46.464 --> 21:48.800
Or, rather, infamy.

21:49.568 --> 21:51.680
Yeah, well, I can relate.

21:58.144 --> 22:01.760
I thought
I heard voices out here.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.961
My kind of people, huh?
Night owls. I'll bartend.

22:05.344 --> 22:08.128
Well, I'm more of a rooster
these days,

22:08.288 --> 22:10.271
so, you two have at it.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.248
Oh, no. Ugh, no.

22:15.071 --> 22:17.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Kasper,
where the hell are you going?

22:17.632 --> 22:20.576
- Oi, it's time for a drink.
- I think I'm also

22:20.960 --> 22:22.496
a little bit more of a rooster
myself.

22:23.456 --> 22:26.208
Roosters? No, no, fuck roosters.
All right? Fuck 'em.

22:26.464 --> 22:27.519
Night owls fly down

22:27.648 --> 22:29.568
with their claws
and kill roosters.

22:30.176 --> 22:31.808
And then eat them.

22:32.832 --> 22:34.335
Well, when you put like that.

22:37.696 --> 22:39.168
Ooh.

22:39.328 --> 22:41.280
Thank you.

22:48.224 --> 22:49.088
Cheers.

22:50.304 --> 22:52.992
The bold will die,
as will the strong.

22:53.568 --> 22:55.552
As legends, we go on.

22:56.351 --> 22:58.624
- Wait. What... what was that?
- What?

22:59.392 --> 23:01.408
- What did you say?
- What?

23:01.888 --> 23:03.039
What are you talking about?

23:03.168 --> 23:04.704
It was a toast
my father used to say.

23:06.304 --> 23:07.712
My father was a hard man.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.944
But he made me
the man I am today...

23:12.256 --> 23:14.400
by beating the ever-living shite
out of me

23:14.559 --> 23:16.032
every day he was alive.

23:21.088 --> 23:23.872
Anyway...
...repeat after me.

23:24.448 --> 23:26.432
- The bold will die.
- The bold will die.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.256
- As will the strong.
- As will the strong.

23:28.384 --> 23:31.360
- As legends we go on.
- As legends we go on.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.056
- Slainte.
- Skoal.

23:48.256 --> 23:49.824
Are you a friendly ghost,
Casper?

23:50.656 --> 23:52.384
Actually,
it's Kasper with a K.

23:52.704 --> 23:55.328
We didn't really
have that cartoon in Sweden.

23:56.608 --> 23:59.392
We had <i>The Moomins,</i> though.
You should check that out.

24:00.096 --> 24:02.784
So, why do they call you
Headstone?

24:09.120 --> 24:10.944
Because I put
people into the earth.

24:12.064 --> 24:13.536
Lay them to rest, so to speak.

24:14.688 --> 24:15.648
Fair enough.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.016
And because it rhymes
with Malone.

24:19.488 --> 24:20.384
It does.

24:21.952 --> 24:23.776
Also,
I have an extremely hard head.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.144
Okay.

24:26.687 --> 24:30.527
So, it's a... a triple entendre
when you think about it, right?

24:30.720 --> 24:32.736
I... I got it.

24:36.128 --> 24:38.528
- Right. Slainte!
- Skoal!

24:39.040 --> 24:39.904
What?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.496
- Just drink.
- Fair enough.

24:49.216 --> 24:51.712
They don't have any
fucking beer around here.

24:55.743 --> 24:58.400
And that's why you always
get a Fluffer, okay?

24:58.528 --> 25:00.576
I will make a note of that.
Yeah.

25:00.704 --> 25:03.552
Hey, my man,
you know what happened

25:03.680 --> 25:05.568
in the <i>fútbol</i> match
Colo-Colo y La U?

25:06.720 --> 25:10.689
Hey. Do you speak Spanish?
<i>Fútbol,</i> you know?

25:11.103 --> 25:13.664
Oh, I got it, I got it.
It's soccer, isn't it?

25:13.856 --> 25:14.943
You know about soccer?

25:15.072 --> 25:16.417
Why do some people
call it soccer

25:16.544 --> 25:17.471
and some football?

25:17.760 --> 25:19.872
Never understood that.

25:20.064 --> 25:24.097
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

25:24.640 --> 25:26.144
Furcas, how are you doing, mate?

25:26.368 --> 25:29.536
<i>Congratulations on making it
through the first three days</i>

25:29.664 --> 25:31.007
<i>in the Funhouse.</i>

25:31.232 --> 25:33.920
<i>I see friendships were made,
some more than others.</i>

25:34.048 --> 25:35.488
<i>There were some tense moments,</i>

25:35.617 --> 25:38.240
<i>but all in all, it looked
like everyone's had fun,</i>

25:38.432 --> 25:40.064
<i>and that's the name
of the game.</i>

25:40.511 --> 25:42.880
<i>But now, the votes are in,
and, unfortunately,</i>

25:43.008 --> 25:45.440
<i>for one of you,
it's time to say goodbye.</i>

25:45.696 --> 25:48.384
<i>So, without further ado,
let's find out who.</i>

25:48.864 --> 25:50.463
Let's go.

25:56.032 --> 25:57.024
Come on. Come on.

25:57.152 --> 25:59.680
Yeah! Go, Dex! Go, Dex! Go, Dex!

26:00.096 --> 26:01.344
<i>Well, there we have it.</i>

26:01.472 --> 26:02.880
You fucking won.

26:03.551 --> 26:05.760
Three percent.
What in the actual fuck?

26:05.920 --> 26:07.616
<i>Ula taking an early lead.</i>

26:07.776 --> 26:10.336
<i>Looks like turning off
the blur feature in the shower</i>

26:10.496 --> 26:11.680
<i>really helped your cause.</i>

26:12.000 --> 26:14.367
<i>Cat with a strong second,
followed by Dex,</i>

26:14.560 --> 26:17.568
<i>Headstone, Kasper,
and Ximena, a tight race.</i>

26:18.080 --> 26:19.424
<i>Then we have Lonni and Nevin.</i>

26:19.745 --> 26:22.240
<i>But because your votes
are within one percent,</i>

26:22.368 --> 26:24.192
<i>you'll both have to undergo
a challenge</i>

26:24.319 --> 26:26.272
<i>to see who makes it
to the next round.</i>

26:26.465 --> 26:29.215
<i>So, let's just see
what your challenge shall be.</i>

26:29.760 --> 26:31.424
<i>Piñata Party!</i>

26:32.832 --> 26:33.952
What?

26:34.240 --> 26:35.680
- Yo, that's racist.
- A little.

26:35.839 --> 26:38.111
<i>Lonni, Nevin,
please follow the helper</i>

26:38.240 --> 26:40.127
- <i>to your first challenge.</i>
- Well...

26:40.287 --> 26:42.080
...let's get this over with.

26:45.024 --> 26:46.432
Bye-bye.

26:51.361 --> 26:52.800
It's because I'm a Limey,
isn't that it?

26:52.960 --> 26:54.720
Yeah, colonialism,
that's what it is.

26:54.848 --> 26:56.512
All right,
you bamboo-munching Muppet,

26:56.640 --> 26:59.200
lets' go. I'll let this happen,
but this is bullshit.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.184
Yeah, number one bullshit.

27:02.496 --> 27:03.936
It ain't 'cause he's British.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.785
It's because he bitches
all the time.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.288
People don't like whiny shit.

27:09.248 --> 27:11.904
But you know what people
do like is T&A.

27:12.128 --> 27:13.569
- Yeah, boy.
- Excuse me?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.489
Oh, nothing. I'm just saying.

27:16.032 --> 27:18.273
Well, I'm just saying,
show them if you got them.

27:18.464 --> 27:19.776
Oh, yes, girl, I got them.

27:20.161 --> 27:22.015
And everything you see
is a 100 percent real.

27:22.367 --> 27:23.552
People voted for me

27:23.680 --> 27:25.056
because I'm a nice person.

27:25.247 --> 27:28.287
- I'm likeable, bitch.
- Ooh.

27:28.448 --> 27:30.207
No, babe,
they voted for you

27:30.336 --> 27:32.736
because you showered naked
in front of millions of people.

27:33.343 --> 27:35.807
But whatever,
that's real classy, ho.

27:36.481 --> 27:37.920
Oh, whoa, whoa.

27:39.872 --> 27:41.632
- I like you still a lot.
- I know.

27:42.016 --> 27:45.504
<i>For the rest of you lucky few,
to the Witness Room you go.</i>

27:46.656 --> 27:48.287
- Come on.
- Here we go.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.719
Let's fucking go.

27:50.849 --> 27:51.744
I'll take that with me.

28:16.639 --> 28:19.071
They must have ran out of cash
for this part of the house, huh?

28:19.296 --> 28:21.536
In procession, man.

28:26.751 --> 28:28.704
Nice decor.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.264
Oh, shit.

28:36.543 --> 28:38.719
Fucking move there.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.639
Holy moly.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.080
What they got in there?

28:42.368 --> 28:44.127
Listen, what is this house?
I can't see shit.

28:44.512 --> 28:46.143
What is this? Is it like
a peep show or something?

28:46.272 --> 28:47.425
Oh, shit.

28:47.553 --> 28:48.960
Too bad Ula's on the wrong side.

28:49.088 --> 28:51.551
- Ooh!
- Funny, bitch.

28:57.632 --> 28:58.848
- El Shocker!
- One...

29:01.280 --> 29:02.816
- Get it, girl.
- Come on, Lonni.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.625
- Team Lonni.
- Whoo!

29:10.751 --> 29:12.160
Yeah, you go, girl.

29:17.249 --> 29:20.863
<i>Hello, Lonni, are you ready
for your first challenge?</i>

29:21.056 --> 29:24.351
- Let's do this.
- <i>This is going to be fun.</i>

29:26.175 --> 29:27.936
That should be Ximena's
challenge.

29:28.095 --> 29:29.247
I'm sure she's a pro.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.104
I wouldn't be talking
about pros, babe.

29:31.423 --> 29:32.640
Just 'cause you're not
on a corner

29:32.769 --> 29:33.824
doesn't mean you're not selling.

29:35.489 --> 29:37.087
Oh, don't worry about that.
Don't worry about that.

29:37.248 --> 29:39.007
<i>The challenge is quite simple.</i>

29:39.136 --> 29:42.880
<i>You must break open the piñata
and retrieve what's inside.</i>

29:43.136 --> 29:47.040
<i>Then using an identical piñata,
Nevin will do the same.</i>

29:47.200 --> 29:51.071
<i>Whoever's fastest, wins.
Good luck to you.</i>

29:52.736 --> 29:55.263
- This is fine. It's fine.
- Easy one.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.984
- Go, Lonni.
- Give her the bat.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.744
They didn't even give her
the bat.

29:59.871 --> 30:01.056
The piñata's going away.

30:05.567 --> 30:07.520
Very funny, guys.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.792
- What the fuck?
- Wow!

30:10.527 --> 30:11.809
Is that Nevin?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.144
He's got a fucking gag
in his mouth.

30:18.144 --> 30:19.649
What the fuck?

30:20.192 --> 30:21.633
- This is a joke.
- Well, what if...

30:29.056 --> 30:30.495
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

30:30.656 --> 30:32.800
- No, for real. Lonni.
- Lonni, stop!

30:35.712 --> 30:37.056
- Lonni!
- It's fake.

30:37.215 --> 30:39.583
You guys are so gullible, man.
Relax.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.191
- No!
- Fuck.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.473
- What the fuck?
- Lonni!

30:48.960 --> 30:50.080
Stop!

30:51.551 --> 30:52.896
No, stop!

30:53.696 --> 30:55.008
Dammit!

30:56.320 --> 30:57.407
Hey!

30:58.080 --> 30:58.976
Stop it, man!

31:01.120 --> 31:02.560
- Turn that off! Turn that...
- No. No, no, no.

31:02.688 --> 31:04.160
- Yeah, no.
- That's crazy.

31:04.287 --> 31:05.472
Relax.
Like, it's not even real.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.263
No! Lonni!

31:11.967 --> 31:13.152
<i>Well done, Lonni.</i>

31:13.344 --> 31:15.647
<i>You can take off
your goggles now.</i>

31:24.672 --> 31:27.296
This is fucked.

31:27.999 --> 31:29.440
Oh, my God!

31:40.193 --> 31:41.600
This isn't happening.

31:41.727 --> 31:43.391
Where's he going?

31:43.647 --> 31:45.120
- Fuck.
- Come on!

31:45.311 --> 31:46.720
<i>Wasn't that fun?</i>

31:48.447 --> 31:50.657
What the fuck is going on here?

31:51.071 --> 31:52.191
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

31:52.416 --> 31:54.111
Who are you?
What is this place?

31:55.584 --> 31:57.313
What the fuck are you?

31:59.167 --> 32:00.704
The question is not what am I?

32:01.087 --> 32:03.233
But it's what are you?
All of you?

32:03.360 --> 32:04.544
I wanna go home.

32:04.736 --> 32:07.711
Now, see, Ula,
this is your home now,

32:07.904 --> 32:09.888
except only one of you
will ever leave.

32:10.049 --> 32:13.024
- Ximena, come on!
- Why are you doing this?

32:13.151 --> 32:15.167
All will be revealed
in due time.

32:15.456 --> 32:17.729
<i>But until then you will
continue to live in the house,</i>

32:17.856 --> 32:20.864
<i>until another vote is tallied
and another challenge is met.</i>

32:21.120 --> 32:23.904
If you refuse to participate,
if you try to escape,

32:24.127 --> 32:26.144
<i>if you do not comply
in any way,</i>

32:26.304 --> 32:28.479
a fate far worse
than Nevin's awaits,

32:28.607 --> 32:29.504
I assure you.

32:29.631 --> 32:31.136
<i>The horror and the pain</i>

32:31.296 --> 32:34.176
will be unlike anything
you could possibly imagine.

32:34.464 --> 32:36.033
<i>So, you must complete
your obligation</i>

32:36.159 --> 32:40.031
<i>and finish what you've started.
So, put on a happy face!</i>

32:40.544 --> 32:42.175
Get the audience on your side!

32:42.497 --> 32:44.223
<i>Win their hearts,
and more importantly,</i>

32:44.352 --> 32:46.847
<i>their votes, for your fate
is in their hands.</i>

32:47.201 --> 32:50.369
<i>Now, would you all please
kindly adjourn to the Funhouse?</i>

32:50.624 --> 32:53.088
<i>Have yourselves a drink.
You've earned it.</i>

32:53.664 --> 32:55.968
Especially you, Lonni.

32:57.471 --> 32:59.487
<i>Up next,</i> Furcas's House of Fun,

32:59.648 --> 33:02.207
<i>or what is now simply being</i>
<i>called</i> Funhouse,

33:02.335 --> 33:03.776
<i>turned into a nightmare
last night,</i>

33:03.969 --> 33:06.624
<i>when famed YouTube diva,
Nevin Eversmith</i>

33:06.753 --> 33:08.064
<i>was beaten to death</i>

33:08.191 --> 33:10.944
<i>by season 18 bride-to-be,
Lonni Byrne.</i>

33:11.136 --> 33:13.088
<i>Personally,
the only nightmare I see here,</i>

33:13.217 --> 33:15.233
<i>is that people are actually
eating up this shit</i>

33:15.360 --> 33:17.600
<i>and asking for seconds.
I mean, sure,</i>

33:17.727 --> 33:19.904
<i>I've wanted to use Nevin
as a human piñata,</i>

33:20.033 --> 33:21.504
<i>and beat him
with a spiked baseball bat,</i>

33:21.631 --> 33:22.848
<i>but who hasn't?</i>

33:23.009 --> 33:24.224
<i>And unfortunately,
I'd go to jail.</i>

33:24.351 --> 33:26.240
<i>Sorry,</i> Funhouse, <i>not buying it.</i>

33:29.184 --> 33:31.104
I accept thee
as my Lord and Savior...

33:32.095 --> 33:34.719
assured of thy mercy
as long as I may live.

33:35.168 --> 33:37.664
Oh, Holy God.
Oh, Holy Death, Holy.

33:37.887 --> 33:40.897
So, what're we gonna do, huh?
Let's get the fuck out.

33:41.024 --> 33:42.977
This is online.
The cops had to see that.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.960
Do you see
any cameras here, huh?

33:45.088 --> 33:46.239
Slowdown. Just relax.

33:46.527 --> 33:49.184
Relax? Did you see
what just fucking happened?

33:49.311 --> 33:51.391
- She murdered Nevin, man!
- Shut up!

33:51.744 --> 33:53.664
Nobody murdered anybody!
She didn't even fucking know.

33:53.793 --> 33:56.288
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
Let's go.

33:58.144 --> 34:00.704
Hey. Hey.
There's a way out of here.

34:01.057 --> 34:02.400
I can see the fucking sky.

34:02.529 --> 34:04.735
Are you deaf, you fucker, huh?

34:04.864 --> 34:06.176
Did you not hear what he said?

34:06.399 --> 34:09.056
We break the window, we climb,
and we fucking run.

34:09.888 --> 34:11.136
This ain't no plexiglass,
trust me.

34:11.295 --> 34:12.737
Just chill. We've gotta think.

34:12.864 --> 34:15.103
Hey! You stay if you want.
I'm out.

34:15.583 --> 34:17.440
Maybe he's right.
It looks like a way out.

34:17.696 --> 34:18.944
We can't just sit here.

34:19.167 --> 34:21.281
- He's watching us.
- Oh, yeah? Let's find out.

34:21.408 --> 34:23.360
- No!
- Hey, you fucking, fuck...

34:25.952 --> 34:28.032
- Watch this, you fuckers!
- No!

34:41.280 --> 34:42.239
It's a projection.

34:42.464 --> 34:43.679
No, shit.

34:44.192 --> 34:47.328
- What is this place?
- <i>This place is your home.</i>

34:47.520 --> 34:49.184
<i>And I was very clear
on what would happen</i>

34:49.344 --> 34:50.815
<i>if you tried to leave.</i>

34:51.041 --> 34:53.664
<i>Unfortunately, Dex has now
forfeited his spot in the house</i>

34:53.792 --> 34:57.056
<i>and will no longer be eligible
for the five million dollars.</i>

34:57.407 --> 34:58.561
Oh, no.

35:00.864 --> 35:02.271
<i>Dex, kindly</i>

35:02.401 --> 35:03.713
- <i>follow them, please.</i>
- What are you gonna do?

35:03.840 --> 35:05.728
You gonna shoot me, huh? Huh?

35:07.104 --> 35:10.751
No, please.

35:10.944 --> 35:12.192
Fuck!

35:13.056 --> 35:17.567
Dex! Dex!

35:29.441 --> 35:33.377
Please... help me!

35:34.975 --> 35:39.041
Mother of God, please. Please.

35:39.904 --> 35:42.527
My God, what's happening?

35:46.624 --> 35:48.704
- Please!
- What is that shit?

35:49.760 --> 35:52.481
<i>That shit
is fluoroantimonic acid.</i>

35:52.864 --> 35:54.656
<i>It's an inorganic compound
created</i>

35:54.784 --> 35:58.464
<i>by reacting hydrogen fluoride
with antimonic pentafluoride.</i>

35:58.783 --> 36:01.217
<i>According to the Hammett
acidity function,</i>

36:01.376 --> 36:03.936
<i>it's the most corrosive
substance on earth.</i>

36:04.097 --> 36:06.240
<i>When mixed with water,
the chemical reaction</i>

36:06.369 --> 36:09.153
<i>will dissolve flesh and bone
within minutes.</i>

36:09.664 --> 36:12.800
- <i>Have fun with that, Dex!</i>
- Wait!

36:13.632 --> 36:16.127
- They're not doing that.
- Oh.

36:21.759 --> 36:23.711
Oh, my God!

36:36.287 --> 36:37.697
<i>A horrific spectacle</i>

36:37.824 --> 36:39.392
<i>has been unfolding
on the internet this week,</i>

36:39.521 --> 36:41.280
<i>broadcasting live to the world.</i>

36:41.408 --> 36:42.911
<i>Authorities have yet to comment</i>

36:43.039 --> 36:44.576
<i>on the video's authenticity.</i>

36:44.736 --> 36:46.400
<i>What started
as an online reality series</i>

36:46.528 --> 36:48.064
<i>is now a nightmare for a group.</i>

36:48.192 --> 36:50.304
<i>What appears
to be a macabre contest,</i>

36:50.433 --> 36:52.768
<i>eight celebrities compete
to survive...</i>

36:52.896 --> 36:55.104
<i>And what we know so far,
is that the eight contestants</i>

36:55.233 --> 36:57.407
<i>flew into Los Angeles
four days ago,</i>

36:57.536 --> 36:58.752
<i>and then vanished.</i>

36:59.040 --> 37:01.632
<i>Whether a sadistic game
or an elaborate hoax,</i>

37:01.760 --> 37:04.256
<i>the show's popularity
continues to skyrocket</i>

37:04.416 --> 37:06.943
<i>even after two people
have allegedly been murdered.</i>

37:07.136 --> 37:09.696
<i>Authorities are currently
trying to locate the source</i>

37:09.823 --> 37:12.896
<i>of what has now been confirmed
to be a live video feed</i>

37:13.056 --> 37:14.464
<i>from inside the house.</i>

37:20.096 --> 37:21.439
Just kill him already!

37:21.568 --> 37:23.744
<i>Oh,
I'm sure he's on his last legs.</i>

37:23.968 --> 37:28.224
No!

37:31.616 --> 37:33.984
<i>So, take a good look
and understand this,</i>

37:34.176 --> 37:36.576
<i>which now I reiterate
for the second time.</i>

37:36.832 --> 37:38.144
<i>There will be no heroes here.</i>

37:38.400 --> 37:42.048
<i>No fantastical plans to escape.
No happy ending.</i>

37:42.176 --> 37:44.992
<i>If you don't play the game
and abide by its rules,</i>

37:45.311 --> 37:46.816
<i>this will be your fate.</i>

37:47.008 --> 37:50.207
<i>But rest assured, next time
it won't be as quick and easy.</i>

37:50.561 --> 37:53.536
<i>You can expect much more pain.
Much more suffering.</i>

37:53.792 --> 37:56.096
<i>So, focus your energies
on accumulating votes,</i>

37:56.608 --> 37:59.232
<i>for it is the only way
out of here.</i>

38:00.767 --> 38:04.832
<i>Hey, kids. The word of the day
is fluoroantimonic acid.</i>

38:05.056 --> 38:06.624
<i>And our good, ole pal,
El Shocker,</i>

38:06.752 --> 38:07.872
<i>took one hell of a bath.</i>

38:08.000 --> 38:09.568
<i>♪ El Shocker, El Shocker ♪</i>

38:09.696 --> 38:10.912
- <i>Really?</i>
<i>- You know.</i>

38:11.040 --> 38:12.448
<i>I mean,
I can create a better CG</i>

38:12.576 --> 38:14.048
<i>with my Instagram filters.</i>

38:14.175 --> 38:16.256
<i>- Then what?
- Fake!</i>

38:18.080 --> 38:19.584
This can't be happening to me.

38:19.871 --> 38:22.016
Well, I hate
to break it to you, girl...

38:22.815 --> 38:24.096
because it's happening
to all of us.

38:24.416 --> 38:26.400
Not just
to poor, little Miss Instagram.

38:26.528 --> 38:27.648
But look at the bright side.

38:28.256 --> 38:30.880
You and the twins are racking up
millions of followers by now.

38:31.008 --> 38:32.448
- Fuck you.
- What's up?

38:32.672 --> 38:34.048
You don't like the exposure?

38:34.335 --> 38:35.488
Isn't that how you make
a living?

38:35.840 --> 38:37.728
Showing your tits and ass
for the world to see.

38:37.856 --> 38:40.160
Yeah, and you blog about her
showing her tits and ass,

38:40.352 --> 38:41.983
and about me, and Lonni,
and anyone else

38:42.112 --> 38:43.488
you feel so inclined
to lie about.

38:43.616 --> 38:46.144
I don't lie, man.
I report the news you make

38:46.272 --> 38:47.679
by doing stupid ass shit.

38:47.808 --> 38:49.152
Stupid ass shit
like living my life?

38:49.344 --> 38:51.040
You love to watch people
crash and burn,

38:51.168 --> 38:53.824
- and you fucking exploit it.
- I give people what they want.

38:54.560 --> 38:58.528
I give people a closer look
into the fake fucking lives

38:58.688 --> 39:00.416
that you choose
to show the world.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.111
That's what I do.

39:03.168 --> 39:04.704
Dex and Nevin are dead.

39:06.336 --> 39:08.928
And you're bickering
about this bullshit?

39:10.272 --> 39:13.216
- You people are insane.
- And annoying as fuck.

39:13.376 --> 39:15.104
Now, I think all of youse
need a time-out.

39:15.328 --> 39:19.904
Now, who wants a drink?
I'm buying. Kaz? Come on.

39:27.104 --> 39:28.959
<i>I don't know
if anyone is watching...</i>

39:29.888 --> 39:32.927
or if this is some sick game.

39:34.656 --> 39:35.744
Or a nightmare.

39:36.160 --> 39:40.832
How is anybody expected to speak
after witnessing that?

39:41.312 --> 39:42.848
You know,
I've seen a lot of crazy shite

39:42.976 --> 39:45.536
in my life,
but, uh, this takes the cake.

39:45.728 --> 39:48.159
Please, somebody help us.

39:48.448 --> 39:50.176
I saw them die.

39:51.328 --> 39:52.704
We don't deserve this.

39:52.896 --> 39:56.288
<i>We're still people with a soul,
and we're still human beings.</i>

39:56.640 --> 39:57.856
I don't wanna die.

39:58.240 --> 40:01.984
<i>To Nevin's family,
I didn't know. I'm so sorry.</i>

40:02.144 --> 40:04.128
I have one thing
to say to you, Furcas.

40:05.472 --> 40:06.624
<i>Go to hell.</i>

40:06.976 --> 40:07.680
Fuck you.

40:07.808 --> 40:10.367
You cowardly piece of shite.

40:11.136 --> 40:12.192
<i>Goodbye.</i>

40:19.232 --> 40:21.504
<i>And now, for a unique
perspective on these events,</i>

40:21.696 --> 40:24.800
<i>we turn to Grammy Award-winning
pop artist, Darla Drake,</i>

40:24.960 --> 40:26.335
<i>who was once married
to Kasper Nordin,</i>

40:26.656 --> 40:29.184
<i>one of the contestants
currently inside the house.</i>

40:29.312 --> 40:31.648
<i>Darla, thank you for joining us
during what I'm sure</i>

40:31.776 --> 40:33.312
<i>is an extremely difficult time.</i>

40:33.760 --> 40:36.192
<i>I just can't believe something
like this is happening.</i>

40:36.992 --> 40:40.064
<i>It's... it's beyond words.</i>

40:43.168 --> 40:45.183
<i>To the people
who are doing this...</i>

40:45.312 --> 40:46.976
<i>Kasper is a good man.</i>

40:48.320 --> 40:50.240
<i>He's never done anything
to hurt anyone.</i>

40:50.784 --> 40:52.032
<i>None of these people have.</i>

40:53.152 --> 40:56.352
<i>Please, if you're listening,
just let them go.</i>

40:57.120 --> 40:58.304
<i>And also, to the public</i>

40:58.464 --> 40:59.904
<i>who is watching
and voting on this.</i>

41:00.032 --> 41:02.496
<i>These are people's lives
that you're playing with.</i>

41:02.815 --> 41:04.352
<i>You have to stop
perpetuating this.</i>

41:04.512 --> 41:06.464
<i>Somebody has to stop this.</i>

41:07.584 --> 41:10.689
<i>But what if their votes,
or your vote,</i>

41:10.816 --> 41:12.352
<i>could help save Kasper?</i>

41:39.903 --> 41:44.480
So, an Irishman, a Mexican,
a Filipino, a Swede,

41:44.736 --> 41:46.464
and an American walk into a bar.

41:50.144 --> 41:52.352
There's gotta be a punch line
in there somewhere.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.328
- That was nice.
- What?

42:01.408 --> 42:02.529
To laugh.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.640
Well, let's keep it going, then.
Fuck him.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.880
All right. Does any of youse
know any jokes? Kasper?

42:07.296 --> 42:08.992
All right. I had a joke once...

42:09.919 --> 42:10.784
about yodeling.

42:11.552 --> 42:12.640
It went horribly.

42:15.327 --> 42:16.512
Then let's just talk.

42:16.704 --> 42:17.984
Yeah, we should at least
get to know each other

42:18.176 --> 42:19.615
before we die.

42:20.736 --> 42:21.791
Sorry.

42:23.072 --> 42:24.256
What's the topic
of the discussion?

42:24.767 --> 42:29.536
How about... what was it like
being married to Darla Drake?

42:30.336 --> 42:31.552
Boom.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.504
I'm kidding, man.
It's a really bad joke.

42:33.632 --> 42:35.487
No, no, no, I like this topic.

42:35.712 --> 42:37.888
I'm sorry, Ghost,
but I'm a big fan of hers.

42:38.656 --> 42:39.840
Okay, so,
what do you wanna know?

42:40.031 --> 42:41.376
About her shoe size.

42:41.728 --> 42:43.745
And her thoughts
on the climate change.

42:43.871 --> 42:44.927
What do you think I wanna know?

42:45.056 --> 42:46.944
How about start
with how you met?

42:49.664 --> 42:52.576
It was three years ago.

42:53.664 --> 42:55.936
I had just moved to L.A.,
and I was playing

42:56.064 --> 42:58.240
this little gig
at a bar on Sunset.

42:58.752 --> 43:01.632
And one night, Darla showed up.

43:02.207 --> 43:05.216
This was just
before she blew up,

43:05.343 --> 43:07.456
so, I didn't know who she was.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.784
And, um, after the show,
she came up to me.

43:11.136 --> 43:13.760
And to this day, I...
I still can't believe

43:13.887 --> 43:15.072
that she was talking to me.

43:15.744 --> 43:18.527
We closed up,
walked down the street...

43:19.424 --> 43:22.944
talking till the sun came up.
And...

43:24.480 --> 43:26.272
I fell in love with her
right there

43:26.815 --> 43:27.712
on the street.

43:28.127 --> 43:30.240
Two months later
I'm on tour with her.

43:30.368 --> 43:32.256
And three months later
we're married.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.711
It all just happened so fast.

43:36.192 --> 43:38.560
And what age were you
when you got married, 12?

43:40.320 --> 43:42.431
- I was 19.
- Oh.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.632
I guess, young and dumb
really is a thing, huh?

43:46.145 --> 43:48.640
For the record,
the whole backup singer thing

43:48.768 --> 43:51.360
started as a joke.
I was never her backup singer.

43:51.679 --> 43:53.856
She just pulled me up
on stage one night,

43:54.176 --> 43:55.200
just to mess with me.

43:55.616 --> 43:58.464
Headlines. "Pop star falls
for backup singer."

43:59.392 --> 44:00.416
Totally fabricated.

44:00.831 --> 44:03.489
And then we did that stupid
reality show.

44:04.063 --> 44:05.856
And I said I would never
do that again.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.703
And here I am...

44:10.912 --> 44:11.776
again.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.231
Only this time for the money.

44:17.343 --> 44:20.223
Hey,
go easy on yourself, Ghost.

44:20.705 --> 44:22.368
All right,
we're all here for the money.

44:23.072 --> 44:24.767
I spent last summer living
in my car,

44:24.896 --> 44:26.624
so, I can see
how five million dollars

44:27.072 --> 44:29.823
could come in handy.
Well, if I win.

44:30.527 --> 44:32.320
And if you lose,

44:32.544 --> 44:34.783
all your problems
will be gone anyways.

44:35.424 --> 44:37.151
So, it's a win-win?

44:42.368 --> 44:45.183
If Furcas actually
gives the winner five million.

44:45.376 --> 44:47.168
I don't know
about that Furcas guy,

44:47.296 --> 44:49.536
he seems a bit sketchy,
if you ask me.

44:52.063 --> 44:55.136
- Yep.
- You guys having fun?

44:55.680 --> 44:56.959
You all gonna die.

44:57.919 --> 44:58.848
Hilarious.

44:59.073 --> 45:00.929
And what are we supposed
to do instead, babe?

45:01.407 --> 45:03.583
Sit around, sleep, bitch,
cry all day.

45:03.713 --> 45:06.400
Please tell us,
how's this working out for you?

45:06.528 --> 45:08.927
<i>Sorry to interrupt
this riveting conversation,</i>

45:09.056 --> 45:10.176
<i>but the results are in.</i>

45:10.433 --> 45:12.767
<i>I do, however,
have some exciting news.</i>

45:12.992 --> 45:14.912
<i>Since Dex's untimely death,</i>

45:15.040 --> 45:16.736
<i>the viewership
has risen fivefold,</i>

45:16.960 --> 45:19.872
<i>so, a big congratulations
is in order to all of you.</i>

45:20.289 --> 45:23.487
<i>Now, without further ado,
let's find out who.</i>

45:32.927 --> 45:34.016
<i>Nice work, Cat.</i>

45:34.529 --> 45:37.248
<i>It seems, sometimes,
less truly is more.</i>

45:37.536 --> 45:39.936
<i>Lonni, second last
to second place.</i>

45:40.224 --> 45:42.113
<i>Perhaps the mental anguish
you suffered</i>

45:42.240 --> 45:44.607
<i>after disposing off Nevin
in such a gruesome,</i>

45:44.767 --> 45:46.400
<i>yet entertaining fashion,</i>

45:46.527 --> 45:48.255
<i>made you a more sympathetic
character.</i>

45:48.543 --> 45:49.760
You're a piece of shit.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.327
<i>Please refrain
from the clever comments</i>

45:51.456 --> 45:52.480
<i>for the time being, Mr. Nordin.</i>

45:52.896 --> 45:54.911
<i>Third place
is still respectable.</i>

45:55.423 --> 45:57.056
<i>Next, we have Headstone
in fourth,</i>

45:57.343 --> 45:59.904
<i>but look here,</i>
<i>a</i> Funhouse <i>first,</i>

46:00.032 --> 46:01.440
<i>a tie for the bottom two.</i>

46:01.569 --> 46:03.551
There is no way
I tied that bitch.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.560
Okay. Keep talking, stupid.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.064
- Go on, say it.
- Fuck you.

46:08.289 --> 46:11.424
- Go to hell, skank!
- I don't understand you!

46:11.552 --> 46:14.080
Go fuck yourself, stupid!

46:14.207 --> 46:17.184
<i>Ladies, please,
this is very unbecoming.</i>

46:17.440 --> 46:19.967
<i>However, this next challenge
may be just the thing</i>

46:20.096 --> 46:22.047
<i>to help you work
through these issues.</i>

46:22.625 --> 46:26.176
<i>So, let's just see
what your challenge shall be.</i>

46:26.624 --> 46:28.032
<i>Blind Rage.</i>

46:28.289 --> 46:31.009
<i>Well, that sounds fun
and therapeutic.</i>

46:31.136 --> 46:34.113
<i>So, let's all adjourn
to the Kill Room, shall we?</i>

46:37.536 --> 46:38.976
I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

46:39.104 --> 46:41.729
<i>I highly doubt you can outfight
the bullet, Headstone.</i>

46:42.400 --> 46:44.544
- No! No!
- Hey, get your hands off her!

46:44.736 --> 46:47.167
- Hey!
- No!

46:52.032 --> 46:53.887
Fuck!

46:56.033 --> 46:58.591
<i>Welcome
to your Blind Rage challenge.</i>

46:58.720 --> 47:01.889
<i>The rules are simple.
You'll each be given an ax,</i>

47:02.049 --> 47:03.873
<i>the lights will go out,
and you will fight</i>

47:03.999 --> 47:05.376
<i>until one of you is dead.</i>

47:05.503 --> 47:07.713
Please don't do this to us!

47:07.839 --> 47:09.440
<i>There are no pleases here!</i>

47:17.823 --> 47:20.576
You're dead, girl.
You're fucking dead.

47:20.736 --> 47:22.527
<i>It's time to play.</i>

47:24.576 --> 47:25.920
<i>Ready?</i>

47:26.049 --> 47:27.104
<i>Lights out!</i>

47:29.825 --> 47:31.967
Holy shit. Night vision.

47:38.177 --> 47:41.567
Oh, man, she's creeping up.
Shit's about to get real.

47:41.696 --> 47:43.104
Yeah.
Let's go, Ula.

47:47.969 --> 47:49.760
Come on. Watch your back!
Watch your back!

47:49.953 --> 47:51.135
Back up, babe.

47:53.311 --> 47:55.488
Fucker!

47:59.456 --> 48:00.353
She's right there.

48:07.233 --> 48:09.631
I hear you, bitch!

48:12.000 --> 48:14.144
Get up, get up, get up! Get up!
She's there, she's there!

48:14.271 --> 48:15.809
Lose something, bitch?

48:26.496 --> 48:27.840
Go on, pick it up! There!

48:32.607 --> 48:34.560
What a fucking shit day
I'm having.

48:36.800 --> 48:39.487
Say something, you moron!
Say something!

48:39.648 --> 48:42.528
I can't understand you!

48:42.656 --> 48:43.616
Ooh!

48:45.183 --> 48:47.456
Ooh, Jesus Christ.

49:58.593 --> 50:00.927
<i>An ax fight in the dark
between two hot chicks.</i>

50:01.152 --> 50:02.496
<i>Well played,</i> Funhouse.

50:02.655 --> 50:04.160
<i>Well played.
My interest is piqued.</i>

50:04.353 --> 50:05.921
<i>Although, you could've piqued
other parts of me</i>

50:06.048 --> 50:07.519
<i>had they been
more scantily clad,</i>

50:07.872 --> 50:10.560
<i>but choosers can't be beggars
in this crazy world of ours.</i>

50:10.817 --> 50:13.568
<i>Word on the street is, Ximena
has a splitting headache.</i>

50:20.864 --> 50:22.176
Hmm, duck lips.

50:46.719 --> 50:47.807
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:59.936 --> 51:01.407
<i>The question
everyone's asking then,</i>

51:01.536 --> 51:02.816
<i>is why can't authorities find</i>

51:02.944 --> 51:04.577
<i>the source</i>
<i>of the</i> Funhouse <i>website</i>

51:04.704 --> 51:06.560
<i>and where the videos
are being broadcast from?</i>

51:07.135 --> 51:08.417
<i>Yeah, I mean, there's many ways</i>

51:08.544 --> 51:10.112
<i>you can hide
a website's IP address</i>

51:10.241 --> 51:11.904
<i>on the internet.
Typically, they'd use</i>

51:12.096 --> 51:14.591
<i>what's called a Tor network
and a dot onion site.</i>

51:14.751 --> 51:16.575
<i>This will have multiple levels
of encryption</i>

51:16.735 --> 51:18.336
<i>making it virtually impossible
to track down,</i>

51:18.527 --> 51:21.952
<i>but also not easily searchable.
Uh, whoever's behind this,</i>

51:22.080 --> 51:23.648
<i>obviously wants
as many eyes on it as possible,</i>

51:23.777 --> 51:25.888
<i>so,
it has to be on a public domain</i>

51:26.016 --> 51:27.167
<i>and not on the dark web.</i>

51:27.424 --> 51:29.312
<i>Why doesn't the FBI shut down
the website,</i>

51:29.441 --> 51:31.007
<i>so that the public
can't see it?</i>

51:31.392 --> 51:33.855
<i>Taking away the ability
for people to engage.</i>

51:34.144 --> 51:35.553
<i>Yeah, I mean, normally,
they would just blackhole</i>

51:35.679 --> 51:37.695
<i>the... the IP address,
but whoever's behind this</i>

51:37.824 --> 51:39.104
<i>has obviously thought of that.</i>

51:39.296 --> 51:41.664
<i>Um, they're using
a deep-learning virus.</i>

51:41.824 --> 51:43.200
<i>It's a AI of some kind.</i>

51:43.329 --> 51:45.632
<i>Uh, this has, you know,
changing proxies</i>

51:45.792 --> 51:47.359
<i>that act as web servers
popping up</i>

51:47.520 --> 51:49.024
<i>in different countries
all over the world.</i>

51:49.536 --> 51:50.720
<i>Uh, it's called onion routing.</i>

51:50.848 --> 51:52.512
<i>And with this
deep-learning virus,</i>

51:52.672 --> 51:55.713
<i>it frankly makes it impossible
to track down.</i>

51:56.544 --> 51:59.232
<i>Unfortunately,
if I was to guess,</i>

51:59.360 --> 52:02.272
<i>I would say that this show
will continue until...</i>

52:04.224 --> 52:06.527
<i>well, I mean,
until someone wins.</i>

52:11.359 --> 52:12.448
Wake up!

52:20.384 --> 52:23.360
Wake up!

52:27.008 --> 52:29.760
Where are you?

52:36.416 --> 52:37.601
Come on, Headstone.

52:37.792 --> 52:39.744
Come on,
you can't sleep here. Come on.

52:39.968 --> 52:43.424
Fuck off, Ghost!
Can you just let me lay here.

52:52.320 --> 52:54.463
What are you doing?

52:54.625 --> 52:57.664
I was just trying
to get him to bed.

52:58.176 --> 52:59.808
Had a feeling about you two.

53:01.345 --> 53:03.296
Come. Come sit with me, Kasper.

53:03.424 --> 53:05.951
I think I'm gonna head
to bed actually.

53:06.432 --> 53:07.744
You probably should, too.

53:07.903 --> 53:11.392
Why? What do I have to do
tomorrow? Die?

53:13.280 --> 53:15.424
Now, I do understand
the comedy in it.

53:15.840 --> 53:19.391
- I'm gonna die in here.
- Come on, let's get you to bed.

53:27.584 --> 53:29.696
You okay?

53:31.007 --> 53:32.256
Okay, come on.

53:37.695 --> 53:39.840
Come on... it's okay.

53:40.640 --> 53:46.976
- And up. And down you go.
- Stay with me.

53:47.199 --> 53:48.544
Hey, take it easy, okay?
Come on.

53:48.960 --> 53:51.680
- You don't like me, do you?
- Of course, I do.

53:52.512 --> 53:55.584
Then let's do it.
Let's give them what they want.

53:56.128 --> 53:59.040
Maybe they will vote for us.

54:04.288 --> 54:07.296
I'm really sorry,
I can't do that. I can't.

54:07.488 --> 54:09.343
Fucking bastard.

54:09.472 --> 54:10.592
Headstone, Headstone, it's...

54:10.721 --> 54:12.672
Fucking bastard!

54:16.576 --> 54:18.401
Let him go!
You're gonna kill him!

54:18.528 --> 54:22.336
He tried to fuck her!

54:27.104 --> 54:30.016
I've fucking seen you, Ghost!
I fucking saw you!

55:16.544 --> 55:21.664
<i>The wonders of alcohol,</i>
<i>shame, regret, blackouts.</i>

55:22.144 --> 55:24.128
<i>And it almost led to our first</i>

55:24.320 --> 55:26.048
<i>non-challenge murder
in the house.</i>

55:26.304 --> 55:27.680
<i>How's the neck, Kasper?</i>

55:28.672 --> 55:31.424
<i>Well, what a morose group
you all are.</i>

55:31.616 --> 55:32.960
<i>You've certainly taken</i>

55:33.152 --> 55:34.784
<i>the fun out of</i> Funhouse <i>today,</i>
<i>haven't you?</i>

55:35.232 --> 55:37.920
Well, without further ado,
let's find out who.

55:44.992 --> 55:48.159
<i>Wow!
Now, that is indeed a surprise.</i>

55:48.320 --> 55:49.856
<i>Kasper Nordin for the win.</i>

55:50.240 --> 55:52.608
- Quite mind-boggling, actually.
- Fuck you.

55:52.928 --> 55:55.040
<i>And that was quite rude,</i>

55:55.392 --> 55:57.536
<i>but perhaps effective,
considering your vote count.</i>

55:57.696 --> 56:00.544
See, it seems your unwavering
"fuck you" attitude

56:00.672 --> 56:02.048
has made you a crowd favorite.

56:02.240 --> 56:05.024
<i>I mean, we are after all living
in unprecedented times</i>

56:05.248 --> 56:07.456
<i>where ignorance, vulgarity,
and aggression</i>

56:07.680 --> 56:10.464
are all traits to be admired,
so, keep it up!

56:10.912 --> 56:13.216
<i>In second place,
holding strong, is Cat,</i>

56:13.344 --> 56:15.456
<i>followed by Lonni, Headstone,</i>

56:15.648 --> 56:17.920
and finally, Ula.

56:18.304 --> 56:20.960
<i>I guess, even the female form
on full display</i>

56:21.248 --> 56:22.624
<i>can become tiresome.</i>

56:23.296 --> 56:25.824
We are after all living
in the internet age, Ula,

56:25.952 --> 56:28.448
where variety
is just a click away.

56:28.607 --> 56:30.464
<i>Perhaps
you should have focused</i>

56:30.592 --> 56:34.112
on being more genuine.
People love authenticity.

56:34.400 --> 56:39.040
I get it, okay. People hate me.
They love this.

56:39.775 --> 56:41.856
You think it hasn't been
that way my whole life?

56:41.984 --> 56:43.232
Do you think I don't know?

56:43.360 --> 56:44.736
Do you think
I didn't hear everyone talking

56:44.927 --> 56:46.016
about me in school?

56:46.400 --> 56:49.536
Like they still talk about me.
Comment about me.

56:49.727 --> 56:50.943
Like they know me.

56:51.072 --> 56:53.600
"Hey, beautiful." "Hi, darling."
"Hi, sexy."

56:53.856 --> 56:56.992
Whore, bimbo,
skank, gold-digger.

56:57.120 --> 56:59.744
<i>Do you think I don't know?
Well, fuck you!</i>

57:00.160 --> 57:01.632
My name is Ursula Kosmatka.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.520
I don't give a fuck
what you think of me.

57:05.920 --> 57:10.784
Wow. That was authentic, Ula.
That was genuine.

57:10.912 --> 57:13.248
That tugged at the heartstrings.

57:13.696 --> 57:16.288
But unfortunately,
too little too late.

57:17.120 --> 57:20.480
<i>So, let's just see
what her challenge will be.</i>

57:21.311 --> 57:22.752
<i>Forget Me Not.</i>

57:26.144 --> 57:28.864
<i>The Forget Me Not challenge
is a simple variant</i>

57:28.991 --> 57:31.712
<i>of the perennial classic
card game Concentration,</i>

57:32.128 --> 57:33.568
<i>also known as Memory.</i>

57:33.824 --> 57:36.767
<i>You will have two minutes
to match all the card pairs.</i>

57:36.992 --> 57:38.400
<i>If you succeed,</i>

57:38.529 --> 57:40.511
<i>you automatically move on
to the next round.</i>

57:40.768 --> 57:41.952
<i>But if you fail,</i>

57:42.240 --> 57:44.959
<i>well, I strongly suggest
you don't fail.</i>

57:45.376 --> 57:47.904
<i>Your time begins now.</i>

57:48.384 --> 57:50.496
<i>Concentrate!</i>

58:02.880 --> 58:04.768
- Ula, the one on the right.
- Dude, she's probably

58:04.896 --> 58:06.656
- really stressed out right now.
- Aw.

58:06.783 --> 58:07.872
Cut her some slack.

58:18.753 --> 58:20.160
Come on.

58:27.425 --> 58:28.896
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry!

58:32.480 --> 58:33.600
Keep going! Come on!

58:46.047 --> 58:50.784
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

58:50.912 --> 58:56.959
<i>five, four, three, two, one.
Time's up!</i>

58:59.327 --> 59:01.344
<i>Wow, what a barn burner.</i>

59:01.696 --> 59:03.327
<i>I really thought
you had it there, Ula,</i>

59:03.744 --> 59:06.240
<i>but I do see how duck face
and fish gape</i>

59:06.368 --> 59:08.416
<i>can easily be mistaken
for one another.</i>

59:09.152 --> 59:11.649
<i>Bring forth the Wheel of Fun!</i>

59:12.576 --> 59:14.720
<i>You'll have one chance
to spin the wheel</i>

59:14.847 --> 59:16.832
<i>and seal your fate.
If you do the math,</i>

59:16.992 --> 59:20.992
<i>you have a 46.7 percent chance
of landing on a Quick & Easy,</i>

59:21.504 --> 59:24.447
<i>which means you will be shot
in the head point blank.</i>

59:24.608 --> 59:28.639
<i>No pain, case closed.
But there's also Pass the Buck,</i>

59:28.801 --> 59:30.496
<i>which means
you pass a new challenge</i>

59:30.624 --> 59:34.112
<i>onto the next lowest contestant
and move on to the next round.</i>

59:34.303 --> 59:36.513
<i>Better odds than any casino,
right?</i>

59:36.832 --> 59:38.784
<i>Now, those other seven spaces,</i>

59:38.912 --> 59:40.863
<i>you'll wanna avoid those
altogether,</i>

59:41.056 --> 59:44.351
<i>the Rat House and Impaler
being especially messy.</i>

59:44.800 --> 59:46.560
<i>If you choose not to spin,</i>

59:46.783 --> 59:49.151
<i>I'll choose
one of the nasty seven for you.</i>

59:49.311 --> 59:50.592
<i>But wouldn't it be nice</i>

59:50.719 --> 59:52.543
<i>to be in charge
of your own destiny?</i>

59:52.735 --> 59:55.136
<i>So, turn that frown
upside down,</i>

59:55.263 --> 59:58.720
<i>spin the wheel,
and paint the town red.</i>

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.776
I hope she gets the gun.

01:00:16.543 --> 01:00:18.496
Pear of Anguish
sounds pretty interesting.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.120
You're sick. You know that?

01:00:36.224 --> 01:00:39.488
<i>The Rack! Ouch! Arguably</i>

01:00:39.616 --> 01:00:42.336
<i>the most painful torture method
ever devised.</i>

01:00:42.753 --> 01:00:45.665
<i>This is definitely
not your lucky day, Ula.</i>

01:00:45.984 --> 01:00:47.232
<i>Prepare her.</i>

01:00:51.103 --> 01:00:52.863
- Yes!
<i>- Take her alive!</i>

01:01:01.216 --> 01:01:02.688
<i>Ula La More.</i>

01:01:02.816 --> 01:01:04.736
<i>Did you know
your true name, Ursula,</i>

01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:07.809
<i>derives from the Latin word
meaning strong little bear?</i>

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.816
<i>Well, you certainly lived up
to that name today.</i>

01:01:10.944 --> 01:01:14.496
You killed a man
with your teeth, like an animal!

01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:17.471
<i>Perhaps I didn't give you
enough credit, Ula.</i>

01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:21.536
<i>It sure will be a shame
to see you part with us today,</i>

01:01:21.696 --> 01:01:23.873
<i>but alas, you cannot stay.</i>

01:01:24.129 --> 01:01:25.344
Death lies on her

01:01:25.472 --> 01:01:26.784
like an untimely frost...

01:01:26.913 --> 01:01:29.472
...upon the sweetest flower
of all the field.

01:01:29.793 --> 01:01:33.376
- No!
- Stop!

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.160
Look! Look at me! Look at me!
For fuck's... Ula! Hey!

01:01:56.256 --> 01:01:59.520
Oh, there goes an arm!

01:01:59.711 --> 01:02:02.112
For fuck's sake! God! Fuck!

01:02:10.049 --> 01:02:11.969
Funhouse. <i>What the hell?</i>

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:14.271
<i>You go and kill off
the hot Instagram model,</i>

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.320
<i>and right after
she bares her soul to us?</i>

01:02:16.447 --> 01:02:18.400
<i>I mean, do you even know
who your target audience is?</i>

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.383
<i>I was starting
to really like Miss La More,</i>

01:02:20.544 --> 01:02:22.240
<i>and then you go
and rip her limbs off.</i>

01:02:22.369 --> 01:02:25.664
<i>How can you take selfies
without arms?</i>

01:02:33.536 --> 01:02:36.287
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

01:02:36.703 --> 01:02:40.031
<i>I have a surprise for you
waiting by the green door.</i>

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.064
- You're a twisted fuck.
- <i>I apologize, Kasper,</i>

01:03:52.191 --> 01:03:54.207
<i>we couldn't find
any online pictures</i>

01:03:54.336 --> 01:03:56.256
<i>of your parents
due to the fact that they died</i>

01:03:56.384 --> 01:03:57.920
<i>in a car crash
when you were just</i>

01:03:58.047 --> 01:03:59.233
<i>three years old.</i>

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.991
<i>You, however, survived</i>

<i>to become Darla Drake's
ex-husband,</i>

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.856
<i>so, that's a nice silver
lining, isn't it?</i>

01:04:06.624 --> 01:04:08.671
<i>Well, I hope
this trip down memory lane</i>

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.049
<i>has brought some solace</i>

01:04:10.176 --> 01:04:12.607
<i>into your otherwise
wasted lives.</i>

01:04:47.744 --> 01:04:49.248
I'm sorry about your family.

01:04:50.081 --> 01:04:52.863
It just made me realize
that if I die in here,

01:04:52.992 --> 01:04:54.144
what difference does it make?

01:04:54.687 --> 01:04:57.761
He's right, you know?
I contribute nothing.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.119
- I am nothing.
- Don't you dare listen

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.688
to that thing.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.361
I will always be known
as Darla Drake's ex-husband.

01:05:08.031 --> 01:05:09.344
That's my legacy.

01:05:12.513 --> 01:05:14.911
Believe me, I get it.
You forgot you're talking

01:05:15.041 --> 01:05:18.017
to a girl who dated 30 guys
in front of 50 million people,

01:05:18.431 --> 01:05:19.615
and was to marry one of them

01:05:19.743 --> 01:05:21.216
after knowing him
for, like, a month.

01:05:21.728 --> 01:05:23.777
People think I'm shallow.

01:05:24.608 --> 01:05:25.889
That I'm a fame whore.

01:05:26.624 --> 01:05:29.247
But why? 'Cause we were trying
to find someone to love?

01:05:30.047 --> 01:05:31.839
Does that mean
we're not good people?

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:34.015
That we don't contribute?

01:05:35.007 --> 01:05:36.639
We got caught up in something.

01:05:37.473 --> 01:05:40.416
It's this idea
that we need to be somebody.

01:05:41.153 --> 01:05:43.424
I bought into it.
Thought I could find it.

01:05:43.808 --> 01:05:47.136
But you... you just fell in love
with a girl

01:05:47.487 --> 01:05:50.624
and got caught up in her life.
Big difference.

01:05:51.713 --> 01:05:53.537
Social media, tabloids,

01:05:53.664 --> 01:05:57.184
celebrities, fame, money,
it's all bullshit.

01:05:57.855 --> 01:06:02.496
It's taken us down a dark path,
and it has led us right here.

01:06:03.008 --> 01:06:05.599
- I have to explain about Ula.
- No, you don't.

01:06:05.727 --> 01:06:08.384
- Yes, I do.
- You don't owe me anything.

01:06:10.144 --> 01:06:12.544
And I don't feel right talking
about her...

01:06:13.793 --> 01:06:14.720
not now.

01:06:28.224 --> 01:06:29.888
<i>If that's the case,
then why do you think</i>

01:06:30.017 --> 01:06:31.424
<i>your marriage
to Kasper didn't work out?</i>

01:06:31.744 --> 01:06:34.016
<i>I watched</i> Back up Love,
<i>and it seems to me</i>

01:06:34.144 --> 01:06:36.384
<i>like you two were made
for each other.</i>

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.312
<i>With Kasper,
love was never the problem.</i>

01:06:42.464 --> 01:06:45.600
<i>I know this will sound
very trite and cliché,</i>

01:06:45.729 --> 01:06:49.248
<i>but... it's complicated.</i>

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:53.952
<i>Living under a microscope,
it's... it's complicated.</i>

01:06:55.744 --> 01:06:58.752
<i>And he, um... he wanted kids.</i>

01:07:00.255 --> 01:07:03.713
<i>And while I knew he would
be an amazing father...</i>

01:07:06.207 --> 01:07:07.457
<i>I don't know, I just...</i>

01:07:08.864 --> 01:07:12.128
<i>I can't imagine bringing a
child into this world.</i>

01:07:12.831 --> 01:07:14.016
<i>Why not?</i>

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.615
<i>Turn on the news
and take your pick.</i>

01:07:17.216 --> 01:07:20.415
<i>And now, this...</i>
<i>this</i> Funhouse <i>thing.</i>

01:07:21.601 --> 01:07:23.040
<i>I just can't believe
what human beings</i>

01:07:23.169 --> 01:07:27.456
- <i>are capable of.</i>
- <i>Do you still love Kasper?</i>

01:07:30.432 --> 01:07:31.584
<i>I'll always love him.</i>

01:07:33.312 --> 01:07:36.192
<i>So, without further ado,
let's find out who.</i>

01:07:44.415 --> 01:07:46.176
<i>Congratulations, Kasper.</i>

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:49.183
<i>Personally,
I find you quite abrasive,</i>

01:07:49.311 --> 01:07:50.784
<i>but the audience seems
to like you.</i>

01:07:50.944 --> 01:07:53.983
<i>Perhaps the chivalry shown
to the recently departed</i>

01:07:54.144 --> 01:07:55.392
<i>did not go unnoticed</i>

01:07:55.776 --> 01:07:58.368
<i>by the more civilized portion
of the voting audience.</i>

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.871
<i>I do feel that some form</i>

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.944
<i>of vindication is owed
to Mr. Nordin.</i>

01:08:08.544 --> 01:08:11.488
<i>Stay with me.</i>

01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:15.360
- <i>You don't like me, do you?</i>
<i>- Of course, I do.</i>

01:08:15.584 --> 01:08:18.078
<i>Then let's do it.
Maybe they will vote for us.</i>

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:23.743
<i>I'm sorry, I can't do that.</i>

01:08:25.312 --> 01:08:26.944
<i>Fucking bastard.</i>

01:08:27.072 --> 01:08:29.152
- <i>Headstone, Headstone, it's...</i>
- <i>Fucking bastard!</i>

01:08:29.567 --> 01:08:30.752
<i>Let him go!</i>

01:08:31.167 --> 01:08:32.545
- <i>You're gonna kill him!</i>
- <i>He tried to fuck her!</i>

01:08:34.624 --> 01:08:37.439
I'm sorry, Ghost.

01:08:38.528 --> 01:08:40.416
<i>Now, that we've cleared
the air on that,</i>

01:08:40.544 --> 01:08:43.392
<i>back to the count.
We have Lonni in second place,</i>

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:46.751
<i>Cat in third,
and finally, Headstone.</i>

01:08:46.879 --> 01:08:48.287
<i>It seems your drunken antics</i>

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:49.856
<i>will only take you so far.</i>

01:08:50.144 --> 01:08:53.665
<i>Looks like the one-trick pony
has finally run out of tricks.</i>

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.648
Show me the man
behind the puppet

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:58.720
- and I'll show you some tricks.
<i>- All in due time.</i>

01:08:58.912 --> 01:09:02.624
<i>For now, let's just see
what your challenge shall be.</i>

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:07.966
<i>Death Match. The audience
shall choose your fate.</i>

01:09:11.711 --> 01:09:13.216
<i>Vapula</i>

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.616
<i>Sabnock.</i>

01:09:25.055 --> 01:09:27.038
<i>Botis.</i>

01:09:31.264 --> 01:09:33.471
<i>Orobas.</i>

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:40.863
<i>Voting is open for one hour.</i>

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:47.359
No one's gonna vote
on something like this.

01:09:49.247 --> 01:09:50.304
Are they?

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.304
- Whoa!
- Those are big dudes,

01:09:58.432 --> 01:09:59.360
- man.
- Yeah.

01:09:59.743 --> 01:10:01.376
That painting
on their face. Whoo!

01:10:01.504 --> 01:10:03.904
- I like that guy.
- Orobas all the way, man.

01:10:04.032 --> 01:10:05.728
- That dude right there, Botis.
- No, no, no, no.

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:07.744
Vapula all the way, man.

01:10:11.231 --> 01:10:14.079
<i>Come on!</i>

01:10:22.496 --> 01:10:24.928
Botis.

01:10:41.983 --> 01:10:44.224
Sabnock.

01:11:01.536 --> 01:11:03.264
<i>Botis.</i>

01:11:03.424 --> 01:11:05.056
<i>The audience has spoken.</i>

01:11:05.216 --> 01:11:07.488
<i>Headstone versus Botis
to the death.</i>

01:11:07.744 --> 01:11:10.560
<i>If you win,
you continue to the next round.</i>

01:11:10.688 --> 01:11:13.184
<i>If you lose, well...</i>

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:36.320
<i>What I say now
is for one person,</i>

01:11:36.448 --> 01:11:37.792
<i>and one person only.</i>

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:41.280
My daughter...

01:11:41.408 --> 01:11:42.272
...Nina.

01:11:43.008 --> 01:11:44.608
<i>When you grow up,
I hope you never witness</i>

01:11:44.736 --> 01:11:47.456
<i>what happened in here.
I pray you never see that.</i>

01:11:48.159 --> 01:11:51.712
But I do hope that you receive
this message someday,

01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:53.760
so, you can understand something
about me.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.192
<i>I tried to be a good father.</i>

01:11:56.799 --> 01:12:00.000
Now, I know I wasn't allowed
to be around you very much

01:12:00.128 --> 01:12:01.888
because of the bad choices
I made.

01:12:02.496 --> 01:12:05.600
Choices that had nothing
to do with you. It was my fault.

01:12:06.048 --> 01:12:08.576
<i>I did that to us
and for that I'm ashamed.</i>

01:12:09.279 --> 01:12:11.392
I've made so many mistakes.

01:12:13.024 --> 01:12:15.648
I have so much rage.

01:12:16.352 --> 01:12:20.224
But there's one thing
I did do right, you.

01:12:21.887 --> 01:12:23.232
You were the only thing
in my life

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.072
<i>that was pure, and good,
and beautiful.</i>

01:12:27.584 --> 01:12:30.752
<i>My Primrose Princess
in your wee yellow dress.</i>

01:12:32.095 --> 01:12:34.688
Just remember, no matter
what happens in your life,

01:12:34.912 --> 01:12:38.207
that your father loved you
more than anything in his.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:45.248
You are my life... always.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.880
I'll see you later.

01:12:51.136 --> 01:12:54.496
<i>And now, this is the moment
fight fans watching</i>

01:12:54.624 --> 01:12:56.512
<i>around the world
have been waiting for.</i>

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.296
<i>Live
from the Funhouse Kill Room!</i>

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.112
<i>A fight to the death
for the undisputed</i>

01:13:02.272 --> 01:13:03.872
<i>Funhouse Championship
of the world.</i>

01:13:04.064 --> 01:13:06.368
<i>Introducing first, fighting
out of the blue corner,</i>

01:13:06.496 --> 01:13:09.408
<i>a mixed martial artist
holding a professional record,</i>

01:13:09.535 --> 01:13:12.192
<i>28 wins, six losses,
one no contest,</i>

01:13:12.352 --> 01:13:14.432
<i>he stands
five feet ten inches tall,</i>

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.992
<i>weighing in at a 170
and one half pounds,</i>

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.168
<i>fighting out of
Dundalk, Ireland</i>

01:13:19.297 --> 01:13:22.496
<i>James Headstone Malone.</i>

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.224
Come on, buddy.
Come on, you got this.

01:13:24.416 --> 01:13:26.560
<i>Introducing his opponent,
fighting out of the red corner,</i>

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.600
<i>holding a perfect record
of 24 kills, no losses.</i>

01:13:29.728 --> 01:13:31.744
<i>He stands
at six feet ten inches tall,</i>

01:13:31.871 --> 01:13:34.240
<i>weighing in at 340 pounds,</i>

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:38.176
<i>fighting out of the Seventh
Circle of Hell, Botis!</i>

01:13:41.184 --> 01:13:43.487
- Let's go, Botis.
- Why would you cheer for him?

01:13:43.616 --> 01:13:46.304
- It's to the death.
- Look at him, he's massive.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.344
<i>Gentlemen,
the rules are very simple.</i>

01:13:49.503 --> 01:13:51.744
<i>Fight until one of you is dead.</i>

01:13:53.248 --> 01:13:54.911
<i>Begin.</i>

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:23.711
Yes!

01:15:22.783 --> 01:15:26.528
- No!
- Oh, yes, Botis! Yes! Yes!

01:15:43.808 --> 01:15:46.432
- Come on, asshole!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:16:01.183 --> 01:16:02.624
- You got this, Headstone!
- Come on!

01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:05.952
- Tear it out.
- Rip his fucking head off!

01:16:13.056 --> 01:16:14.080
Yes!

01:16:14.432 --> 01:16:15.583
He fucking did it!

01:16:15.744 --> 01:16:17.984
Whoo! Yeah.

01:16:18.303 --> 01:16:21.216
<i>A fantastic display
of courage, Headstone.</i>

01:16:21.472 --> 01:16:25.409
<i>I'd even hazard a guess to say
that if you absolutely had to,</i>

01:16:25.536 --> 01:16:27.008
<i>you could keep fighting.</i>

01:16:27.807 --> 01:16:31.968
<i>Well, you absolutely have to.</i>

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:40.160
No! What the hell is this?
No! Headstone!

01:16:41.599 --> 01:16:43.200
You're a fucking liar
and a snake!

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.088
Okay.

01:16:50.496 --> 01:16:51.840
But just one last thing.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.616
You know you're going
to hell for all this. Right?

01:16:57.856 --> 01:17:02.144
See, the thing is,
I'm going there, too.

01:17:03.104 --> 01:17:04.224
So, I'll be waiting for you.

01:17:04.543 --> 01:17:07.392
And I'll teach you
about fucking pain.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.416
Hell is empty
and all the devils are here.

01:17:24.065 --> 01:17:27.040
- The bold will die...
- As will the strong.

01:17:27.713 --> 01:17:30.432
As legends, we go on.

01:17:35.744 --> 01:17:36.800
Come on!

01:17:39.807 --> 01:17:42.752
- Come on!
- No! No!

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.744
No!

01:17:54.911 --> 01:17:56.000
Fucking stop.

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.711
<i>Okay,</i> Funhouse,
<i>that was one hell of a fight.</i>

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.016
<i>I mean, that Headstone fella
can sure take a beating.</i>

01:18:30.144 --> 01:18:31.680
<i>But then again, we Irish
have been taking them</i>

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.185
- <i>our whole lives.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.583
<i>Sorry, just a bit of sad
reflection for my people.</i>

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:37.215
<i>Not gonna lie,
I was little disappointed</i>

01:18:37.344 --> 01:18:38.976
<i>to see my countryman taken
out that way.</i>

01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:40.320
<i>I mean, three on one?</i>

01:18:40.736 --> 01:18:42.624
<i>That Furcas son of a bitch
is one bold-faced liar.</i>

01:18:42.753 --> 01:18:43.904
<i>Whatever happened to the days</i>

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:47.711
<i>when you could trust the word
of a sadistic, maniacal panda?</i>

01:18:54.273 --> 01:18:55.872
<i>A penny
for your thoughts.</i>

01:18:57.567 --> 01:18:59.391
I'm just wondering who you are.

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:01.920
What kind of person you are.

01:19:02.976 --> 01:19:04.704
What it would be like
to make you suffer.

01:19:04.991 --> 01:19:07.776
<i>I mean, I get
that you are a sadistic animal.</i>

01:19:08.031 --> 01:19:10.111
<i>A coward
that kills innocent people.</i>

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:12.031
Why do you do this?

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:14.208
<i>Celebrated mediocrity</i>

01:19:14.336 --> 01:19:16.160
<i>has become the opiate
of the masses.</i>

01:19:16.289 --> 01:19:20.480
Fame with no expertise,
nor talent, nor accomplishment.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.944
<i>It's a sickness
that must be cleansed.</i>

01:19:23.264 --> 01:19:24.351
<i>It's madness.</i>

01:19:24.864 --> 01:19:27.617
<i>You're important
because you married a pop star,</i>

01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:28.991
<i>simple as that.</i>

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.223
<i>So, now, you must become
the product which you so covet</i>

01:19:32.352 --> 01:19:34.016
<i>in that pathetic life
you have chosen.</i>

01:19:34.368 --> 01:19:37.344
I don't buy it.
There's gotta be more to it.

01:19:37.599 --> 01:19:39.840
<i>What, Mommy and Daddy
didn't love you enough?</i>

01:19:40.033 --> 01:19:43.455
<i>You couldn't get a date
to prom? Or is it chemical?</i>

01:19:43.711 --> 01:19:45.344
Fucked up circuits.

01:19:50.945 --> 01:19:52.256
A penny for your thoughts.

01:19:53.473 --> 01:19:56.320
You are indeed entertaining,
Mr. Nordin.

01:19:57.247 --> 01:19:58.784
But see, that's part of it.

01:19:59.553 --> 01:20:00.416
Entertainment.

01:20:01.409 --> 01:20:03.456
See, I'm doing this
because I must.

01:20:03.775 --> 01:20:05.120
Because somebody had to do it.

01:20:05.439 --> 01:20:08.544
<i>I mean, death and torture
happen all over the world</i>

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:11.009
<i>every single day
to so called innocent people.</i>

01:20:11.424 --> 01:20:13.344
But see, no one really cares
unless it happens

01:20:13.471 --> 01:20:15.360
to a specific group of people,

01:20:15.617 --> 01:20:18.336
of a specific color,
in a specific country.

01:20:18.849 --> 01:20:20.448
So, I bring it to them live,

01:20:20.704 --> 01:20:24.480
<i>unedited, authentic, without
commercial interruption.</i>

01:20:24.704 --> 01:20:25.887
<i>And perhaps</i>

01:20:26.208 --> 01:20:27.807
<i>you're not as innocent
as you thought you were.</i>

01:20:28.001 --> 01:20:30.591
<i>See, it's what you represent
that is the problem.</i>

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.623
This new
Kardashianization of humanity.

01:20:35.009 --> 01:20:36.255
The big decline.

01:20:36.704 --> 01:20:39.999
<i>You are part of a condition
fueled by entertainment.</i>

01:20:40.191 --> 01:20:41.633
<i>News is entertainment,</i>

01:20:41.889 --> 01:20:46.015
politics is entertainment,
war is entertainment,

01:20:46.176 --> 01:20:50.655
and your death, no matter
how insignificant that may be...

01:20:52.353 --> 01:20:53.344
is entertainment.

01:20:53.952 --> 01:20:57.984
<i>Sure, some will weep for you,
others will laugh,</i>

01:20:58.239 --> 01:21:00.737
but make no mistake,
the vast majority of people

01:21:00.864 --> 01:21:04.127
who watch you die
will feel absolutely nothing.

01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:05.984
<i>If you die in this house,</i>

01:21:06.144 --> 01:21:08.256
<i>the people that watch will go
to bed the same at night,</i>

01:21:08.448 --> 01:21:10.815
wake up the next morning,
and go about their lives

01:21:10.944 --> 01:21:12.895
like you never even existed
at all.

01:21:13.152 --> 01:21:16.289
<i>And then they'll find
the next new, shiny object.</i>

01:21:16.416 --> 01:21:17.727
<i>That is entertainment.</i>

01:21:17.888 --> 01:21:21.216
In the end,
we are all just animals, Kasper,

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.375
primitive and self-serving
until that very end comes.

01:21:26.624 --> 01:21:28.640
<i>So, all that garbage
you just spouted,</i>

01:21:28.769 --> 01:21:31.616
<i>makes you, what, our judge,
jury, and executioner?</i>

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.312
It justifies murder?

01:21:34.177 --> 01:21:35.840
Oh, human beings love murder.

01:21:36.128 --> 01:21:38.433
<i>We love violence.
We love death.</i>

01:21:38.591 --> 01:21:40.511
<i>On television in this country,</i>

01:21:40.704 --> 01:21:42.655
<i>a woman's breasts
are more censored</i>

01:21:42.817 --> 01:21:43.808
<i>than a slit throat,</i>

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.231
the word fuck
more than a severed head.

01:21:47.487 --> 01:21:50.144
And look no further
than any comment thread

01:21:50.271 --> 01:21:51.744
of any social media platform

01:21:51.936 --> 01:21:54.401
<i>to see how quickly
a harmless debate</i>

01:21:54.528 --> 01:21:57.600
<i>can devolve into aggression,
violence, and hate.</i>

01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:00.097
<i>What I'm saying is, Mr. Nordin,</i>

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.489
<i>that same instinct lies
in both you and in I.</i>

01:22:04.097 --> 01:22:06.240
Except I choose to embrace it.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.495
I hate to tell you this...
but that thing

01:22:10.817 --> 01:22:16.159
that lives in you... has never,
and will never live in us.

01:22:17.087 --> 01:22:18.944
Oh, I'm betting that it does...

01:22:19.999 --> 01:22:23.072
and that it will reveal itself
very, very soon.

01:22:28.001 --> 01:22:31.264
Well, don't I feel like
the third wheel here.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.696
How about I give you two
some privacy?

01:22:34.113 --> 01:22:35.199
<i>Good talk.</i>

01:22:38.976 --> 01:22:40.224
Look, I, um...

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.200
I'm glad you're here.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.791
Oh, no. That...

01:22:46.464 --> 01:22:47.679
Here, just...

01:22:48.671 --> 01:22:52.639
I just mean, I'm glad
I got the chance to know you...

01:22:53.824 --> 01:22:55.551
even if it was in here.

01:22:57.375 --> 01:22:58.464
Me, too.

01:23:00.896 --> 01:23:03.104
Sure wish it could have been
someplace else, though,

01:23:03.231 --> 01:23:04.929
like a grocery store.

01:23:48.672 --> 01:23:50.016
Hmm. Okay.

01:24:04.479 --> 01:24:09.984
<i>♪ You're nobody
You're nobody... ♪</i>

01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:18.368
Oh.

01:25:13.536 --> 01:25:16.704
<i>And then there were three.
You've come so far...</i>

01:25:16.896 --> 01:25:19.423
Save your breath, asshole.
Just get on with it.

01:25:19.808 --> 01:25:22.592
<i>Well, someone certainly woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.</i>

01:25:22.721 --> 01:25:24.352
<i>Mind you, a bed that
wasn't used</i>

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.143
<i>for much sleeping last night,</i>

01:25:26.272 --> 01:25:27.999
<i>but I digress.</i>

01:25:28.159 --> 01:25:29.793
<i>So, at the behest of Kasper,</i>

01:25:29.951 --> 01:25:32.480
<i>without further ado,
let's find out who.</i>

01:25:39.296 --> 01:25:41.535
<i>And again,
it's Kasper Nordin by a nose,</i>

01:25:41.664 --> 01:25:43.072
<i>followed closely by Lonni.</i>

01:25:43.264 --> 01:25:45.728
<i>It appears,
last night's erotic escapade</i>

01:25:45.856 --> 01:25:48.960
<i>may have paid off,
star-crossed lovers.</i>

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:53.023
<i>And then we have Cat,
the quiet queen of cute.</i>

01:25:53.441 --> 01:25:55.903
<i>Looks like that routine
has finally worn thin,</i>

01:25:56.224 --> 01:25:59.201
<i>so, let's just see
what your challenge shall be.</i>

01:25:59.872 --> 01:26:01.280
<i>Chess Master.</i>

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:05.088
<i>This should be right
up your alley, Cat.</i>

01:26:26.496 --> 01:26:28.960
Found it. Grady, Oklahoma.

01:26:31.968 --> 01:26:34.784
<i>Welcome
to the Chess Master challenge.</i>

01:26:35.168 --> 01:26:36.608
<i>If you are victorious,</i>

01:26:36.736 --> 01:26:39.136
<i>you will receive a free pass
to the next round.</i>

01:26:39.328 --> 01:26:43.328
<i>But if I win, you must spin.
Any questions?</i>

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:46.496
<i>Then ladies first.</i>

01:27:01.408 --> 01:27:05.568
Ah, Grunfeld.
Very interesting. Not bad,

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.352
<i>but not very original
for a grand master.</i>

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.784
<i>Knight to king's bishop three.</i>

01:27:21.248 --> 01:27:23.328
<i>Pawn to king's knight three.</i>

01:27:30.176 --> 01:27:31.936
<i>Bishop to king three.</i>

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.840
<i>Impressive.</i>

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.632
Bishop to queen's bishop five.

01:27:57.216 --> 01:27:58.112
<i>Check.</i>

01:28:00.032 --> 01:28:02.240
<i>Knight to king six.</i>

01:28:03.392 --> 01:28:04.255
<i>Check.</i>

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.680
<i>Knight to queen's bishop six.</i>

01:28:14.207 --> 01:28:15.264
<i>Check.</i>

01:28:19.615 --> 01:28:22.880
<i>Rook to queen's bishop six.</i>

01:28:23.616 --> 01:28:24.736
<i>Checkmate.</i>

01:28:34.975 --> 01:28:38.336
Well played.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.752
Clearly, you were influenced
by Byrne versus Fischer 1956.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.160
Game of the century.

01:28:44.416 --> 01:28:47.136
<i>You are truly formidable.
I mean that sincerely.</i>

01:28:47.392 --> 01:28:51.616
<i>But still you did not win,
so, you must spin.</i>

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:25.728
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Cat Zim has passed the buck.</i>

01:29:26.017 --> 01:29:29.889
<i>Another</i> Funhouse <i>first.</i>
<i>This means a new challenge</i>

01:29:30.016 --> 01:29:32.384
<i>will be passed
onto Lonni Byrne.</i>

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.159
Get out of my way. It's over.
Get out of my way!

01:29:40.288 --> 01:29:43.232
- Let me take her place.
- <i>That's not how this works.</i>

01:29:43.616 --> 01:29:44.672
Please, just let me
take her place.

01:29:44.928 --> 01:29:46.816
<i>A valiant gesture, Mr. Nordin,</i>

01:29:47.008 --> 01:29:50.240
- <i>but there are in fact rules.</i>
- You make the rules!

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.712
<i>What do you fucking care?</i>

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.303
<i>Please, just let me do
the challenge.</i>

01:29:54.464 --> 01:29:55.360
You are indeed

01:29:55.519 --> 01:29:58.528
a pestilent little fuck,
Kasper Nordin.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.368
But seeing as I do love
a good Harlequin romance,

01:30:02.529 --> 01:30:06.112
and this situation definitely
has all of the trappings of one,

01:30:06.272 --> 01:30:08.289
albeit dripping with cheese,

01:30:08.832 --> 01:30:11.616
still I will allow you
to take her place.

01:30:11.968 --> 01:30:14.848
No, no, no.
No, you can't do this.

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:18.688
- No, you're not doing this. No!
- It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.512
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:53.888
<i>Kasper Nordin, let's just see
what your challenge will be.</i>

01:30:55.391 --> 01:30:57.632
Pistols At Dawn! How exciting.

01:30:57.856 --> 01:31:01.632
<i>But who will you face?
I know, Lonni Byrne!</i>

01:31:03.232 --> 01:31:08.673
What? No, no, no. Fuck you!
We had a deal! We had a deal!

01:31:08.864 --> 01:31:10.016
<i>I told you</i>

01:31:10.432 --> 01:31:12.192
<i>there would be no heroes here,
and there certainly</i>

01:31:12.319 --> 01:31:16.000
<i>would be no martyrs. Like
you said, I make the rules!</i>

01:31:16.544 --> 01:31:18.943
<i>If you had just kept
your filthy trap shut, Kasper,</i>

01:31:19.072 --> 01:31:20.800
<i>we wouldn't be in this
position, would we?</i>

01:31:21.055 --> 01:31:23.776
<i>Now,
you will each receive a pistol.</i>

01:31:24.065 --> 01:31:28.096
Stand back-to-back.
On my count, take ten paces,

01:31:28.224 --> 01:31:29.761
<i>turn, and fire.</i>

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.416
<i>If you fail to participate,
or if you refuse to fire,</i>

01:31:32.544 --> 01:31:34.912
<i>you'll each have to face
the wheel.</i>

01:31:35.936 --> 01:31:38.912
<i>Take your pistols
and positions, please.</i>

01:31:42.305 --> 01:31:43.616
<i>Or...</i>

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.504
<i>...if you prefer,
we could always put Lonni</i>

01:31:45.663 --> 01:31:46.848
<i>in the Brazen Bull,</i>

01:31:47.009 --> 01:31:49.311
cook her alive,
and then force feed-her to you

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.583
for dinner. Totally your call.

01:31:57.024 --> 01:31:58.368
It's okay.

01:31:58.529 --> 01:31:59.392
It's okay.

01:32:14.913 --> 01:32:19.263
<i>Goodnight, goodnight.
Parting is such sweet sorrow,</i>

01:32:19.488 --> 01:32:22.272
<i>so, I shall say goodnight
till it be morrow.</i>

01:32:22.432 --> 01:32:24.352
On my count. One...

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.687
- Two.
- <i>...two...</i>

01:32:27.744 --> 01:32:28.832
<i>three...</i>

01:32:30.048 --> 01:32:31.105
<i>four...</i>

01:32:32.447 --> 01:32:33.567
<i>five...</i>

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.616
<i>six...</i>

01:32:36.768 --> 01:32:37.632
<i>seven...</i>

01:32:38.945 --> 01:32:40.000
eight...

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.080
<i>nine...</i>

01:32:43.904 --> 01:32:44.991
<i>ten.</i>

01:33:00.065 --> 01:33:01.663
Get back! We've got a Bomb!

01:33:01.793 --> 01:33:02.688
Get the Bomb Squad!

01:33:38.433 --> 01:33:39.807
We have a winner!

01:33:41.023 --> 01:33:42.400
<i>Cat Zim!</i>

01:34:36.672 --> 01:34:39.456
<i>Well, it's all over
but the proverbial crying,</i>

01:34:39.583 --> 01:34:41.537
<i>culminating
in a Shakespearean tragedy</i>

01:34:41.664 --> 01:34:42.785
<i>for the ages.</i>

01:34:43.104 --> 01:34:44.673
<i>Personally, I think
Kasper and Lonni,</i>

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.656
<i>should have turned their guns
on those dirty pandas</i>

01:34:46.784 --> 01:34:48.960
<i>and shot their way out
Butch and Sundance style,</i>

01:34:49.152 --> 01:34:51.615
<i>made their way down to Vegas
and gotten married.</i>

01:34:52.097 --> 01:34:55.040
<i>But then again,
those pandas had machine guns.</i>

01:34:55.776 --> 01:34:57.344
<i>And then the one
who doesn't even speak</i>

01:34:57.567 --> 01:35:01.151
<i>wins the whole thing?</i>
<i>I guess, less truly is more.</i>

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:03.135
<i>Or maybe
it was the masturbating.</i>

01:35:03.264 --> 01:35:04.287
<i>Who knows?</i>

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.528
<i>Pete Sake, out.</i>

01:35:20.289 --> 01:35:21.631
<i>Cat Zim,
the lone survivor</i>

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.199
<i>of the horrific reality series,</i>

01:35:23.327 --> 01:35:24.543
Funhouse,
<i>was found this morning</i>

01:35:24.672 --> 01:35:26.271
<i>by a motorist
on the remote road</i>

01:35:26.527 --> 01:35:29.280
<i>near the town of Florence,
on the Oregon coast.</i>

01:35:38.047 --> 01:35:39.393
<i>The grisly discovery</i>

01:35:39.519 --> 01:35:40.831
<i>was made by the FBI SWAT team</i>

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.624
<i>who raided the compound.
The device,</i>

01:35:42.751 --> 01:35:44.800
<i>which was initially believed
to be a bomb,</i>

01:35:44.928 --> 01:35:47.136
<i>was later found
to be a decoy server,</i>

01:35:47.264 --> 01:35:48.607
<i>planted by the culprits</i>

01:35:48.737 --> 01:35:50.463
<i>to divert authorities
from their trail.</i>

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.673
<i>As of now,
there are still no suspects</i>

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.856
<i>in the case.</i>

01:35:54.271 --> 01:35:55.744
<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to the</i> Chuck Thorn Show.

01:35:55.904 --> 01:35:58.656
<i>I've been speaking with
tech titan, Nero Alexander,</i>

01:35:58.784 --> 01:36:00.320
<i>owner of over 70 companies,</i>

01:36:00.449 --> 01:36:03.680
<i>ranging from construction,
to biofuels, pharmaceuticals,</i>

01:36:03.903 --> 01:36:06.017
<i>AI, and now,
even nanotechnology.</i>

01:36:06.336 --> 01:36:09.504
<i>Nero, now, you've accomplished
what so few entrepreneurs have.</i>

01:36:09.631 --> 01:36:10.817
<i>You've built an empire</i>

01:36:10.944 --> 01:36:12.511
<i>with literally no help
from anyone.</i>

01:36:12.673 --> 01:36:15.167
<i>You didn't inherit any wealth,
whatsoever. And at one point,</i>

01:36:15.295 --> 01:36:17.633
<i>you were the youngest
self-made billionaire,</i>

01:36:17.793 --> 01:36:19.809
that's with a B, on the planet.

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:23.904
I'm semi-retired now.
I'm trying to have more fun.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.951
So, to all the budding
entrepreneurs

01:36:26.081 --> 01:36:27.967
out there that look up to you
as an example

01:36:28.097 --> 01:36:30.399
of what's possible,
what do you say to them?

01:36:30.881 --> 01:36:32.897
I just feel the majority
of the youth today

01:36:33.089 --> 01:36:36.159
want something for nothing.
They want fame and fortune

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.016
for really doing
as little as possible.

01:36:38.561 --> 01:36:41.024
It's the scientist
who's the role model,

01:36:41.247 --> 01:36:43.871
the physicist, the engineer,
the inventor.

01:36:44.448 --> 01:36:46.176
Not someone
whose only contribution

01:36:46.304 --> 01:36:50.624
to humanity is a sex tape,
or a reality TV show,

01:36:51.072 --> 01:36:53.376
or millions
of social media followers.

01:36:53.504 --> 01:36:56.768
I mean, it's madness.

01:36:58.113 --> 01:36:59.551
<i>So, I guess, I would say,</i>

01:36:59.808 --> 01:37:02.816
<i>do something that contributes
to society.</i>

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:04.673
<i>I know I have.</i>

01:37:42.559 --> 01:37:43.808
Cat Zim.

01:37:46.144 --> 01:37:49.697
Why, you are indeed
full of surprises, aren't you?

01:38:07.104 --> 01:38:09.696
Did you have fun?

01:38:10.848 --> 01:38:13.215
Yes.

01:38:14.207 --> 01:38:15.360
But next time...

01:38:16.384 --> 01:38:20.160
I'm not letting you win
at chess.

01:41:32.416 --> 01:41:36.671
Nevin? No, he's on some show,
<i>Funhouse</i> something.

01:41:37.473 --> 01:41:38.687
What?

01:41:38.912 --> 01:41:40.575

01:41:52.448 --> 01:41:55.488
Fuck me.
Can I have another Mai Tai?
