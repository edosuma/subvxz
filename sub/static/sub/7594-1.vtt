00:22.290 --> 00:27.128
[music playing]

02:57.010 --> 02:57.811
Throw it over here.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.348
Come on, butterfingers.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.349
Throw it here.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.350
Come on.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.356
OK, let's play ball.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.323
Come on now.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.324
Hey, Murph.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.325
What do you want?

03:11.459 --> 03:12.960
Let me in, will ya?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.728
Get out of here.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.196
I got some Sweet Caporal cards.

03:16.330 --> 03:16.830
Who you got?

03:16.964 --> 03:17.831
Hans Wagner.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.467
Grover Cleveland Alexander.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.668
Them old-timers?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.637
Tris Speaker, Johnny Evers?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.573
Has-beens.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.640
Christy Mathewson.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.543
A dime a dozen.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.546
Who you holding out?

03:32.680 --> 03:35.416
Babe Ruth.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.717
A rookie.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.085
Come on, let's play ball.

03:38.218 --> 03:38.886
Come on.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.554
Three strikes and he's out.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.490
Put it over the plate now.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.757
Come on.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.359
He can't hit anything.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.060
Come on.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.762
Oh, what the matter?

03:48.896 --> 03:49.597
Sasha!

03:49.730 --> 03:50.831
Yeah, Mom?

03:50.898 --> 03:53.734
Your professors
here, come and take.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.769
In a minute, Mom.

03:55.903 --> 04:00.274
Not in a minute, Sasha, now.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.275
All right.

04:04.111 --> 04:07.381
Hey, you, come here.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.916
You gonna let me
take his place, Murph?

04:09.049 --> 04:09.883
Give me the cards.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.952
Sure, Murph.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.421
Can I keep Babe Ruth?

04:13.554 --> 04:14.054
Keep him.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.523
Gee, thanks, Murph.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.923
OK, let's play ball.

04:19.627 --> 04:23.397
Get off the sack.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.698
OK, let's go.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.566
Come on.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.567
He's a southpaw.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.801
Come on, over the plate now.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.437
Let's see a good one.

04:53.126 --> 04:53.827
What's your name?

04:53.961 --> 04:54.995
Lou Gehrig.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.506
Well, how about it?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.908
We can't wait here all day.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.177
I can't do anything
without my wife.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.265
I didn't mean to do it, Mom.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.201
I didn't know I
could hit that far.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.537
He busted Colletti's window.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.772
Baseball.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.640
How much?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.142
$18.50.

05:42.275 --> 05:47.147
I told him, Mama, he
should carry glass insurance.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.150
Mr. Coletti, let me
work it out after school.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.184
I'll run errands.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.219
I'll--

05:52.352 --> 05:56.323
No, Louis, what we
break, we pay for.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.860
$16.25, laves $2.25 I owe you.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.028
I pay you Saturday.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.563
OK, Mrs. Gehrig.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.831
I'm sorry.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.065
I'm sorry too.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.000
Me too, Mom.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.069
You better be, young
Gehrig, but I'm telling

06:09.202 --> 06:11.138
you, that was a mighty wallop.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.680
I feel awful about it, Mom.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.681
Honest, I do.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.982
I'll pay you back the money.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.651
I promised to fix Mrs.
Reagan's dumbwaiter.

06:23.751 --> 06:27.220
It isn't just the money,
Lou, it's the time you waste.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.656
I'll get my working papers.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.390
I'll quit school.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.892
Quit school?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.061
How can you say that?

06:34.194 --> 06:35.863
How many times
have I told you, I

06:35.996 --> 06:40.734
want you to go to school and
high school and college and--

06:40.868 --> 06:42.870
look at your papa, look at me.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.439
We didn't go to school,
and what are we?

06:45.573 --> 06:48.576
A janitor, a cook.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.446
I want you to be somebody.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.214
Sure, Mom, sure.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.083
Like your Uncle Otto, Louie.

06:56.216 --> 07:00.187
He went to university,
he graduated.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.924
Don't you see, Louie, that's
why I'm cooking at Columbia,

07:04.091 --> 07:07.294
so you can go there
someday be an engineer

07:07.427 --> 07:09.296
like your Uncle Otto.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.066
Mom, maybe I ain't cut
out to be an engineer.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.768
What do you want to be?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.070
I wanna be a--

07:17.204 --> 07:18.305
I don't know, Mom.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.440
You have got to know.

07:20.574 --> 07:25.746
In this country, you can
be anything you want to be.

07:25.879 --> 07:30.551
Don't you want to be an
engineer like your Uncle Otto?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.085
Don't you?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.086
Sure, Mom, sure.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.221
Whatever you want me to be.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.104
This fraternity has standards.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.405
You just can't
ignore his family.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.508
Yeah, but he's a cinch
to be a four-letter man.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.310
His mother is the
best cook at Columbia.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.913
Somehow that doesn't add up
to Sigma Alpha Psi in my mind.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.982
Oh, Lou's all right, Van.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.117
Just trying to maintain
a certain standard.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.352
Gold standard?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.920
How'd you like to
get this right in the--

08:07.020 --> 08:08.689
[interposing voices]

08:10.524 --> 08:12.860
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.494
Let's put it to a vote.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.764
All those in favor of
pledging Lou Gehrig?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.969
Carried.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.270
Go ahead.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.038
That's what you want, I
won't stand in your way.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.974
Hang a pledge pin
on him, but don't

08:27.040 --> 08:28.776
expect me to call him brother.

08:28.876 --> 08:29.977
Let's eat.

08:30.110 --> 08:30.944
I don't know why
this has to happen

08:31.044 --> 08:31.812
every night before dinner.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.280
[interposing voices]

08:42.289 --> 08:43.691
You certainly
smacked that ball

08:43.823 --> 08:45.325
around this afternoon, Lou.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.393
Yeah.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.861
Tough on the guys who
live in the dormitory.

08:48.028 --> 08:48.896
You never know when
you're going to get

08:49.029 --> 08:51.198
a baseball in your geometry.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.800
What's your
batting average now?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.134
I'll swap it for
your math grade.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.306
Hold it, Lou.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.717
Gee, thanks.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.686
Thanks, fellas.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.588
This is an honor.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.889
You know, I'm not
much on talking.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.727
I'd just like to
say thanks, fellas.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.662
Welcome in, Lou.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.564
He's a swell guy.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.532
Hi, Mom.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.234
What?

09:27.367 --> 09:28.602
I just said hi.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.603
Hi.

09:29.737 --> 09:33.573
The soup is getting cold.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.407
Mom?

09:34.541 --> 09:35.408
What?

09:35.542 --> 09:38.178
Look.

09:38.245 --> 09:42.282
Oh, Lou, they took you in.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.416
Yeah, just now.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.620
Oh, Lou, everything
is going so fine now.

09:46.754 --> 09:49.089
First Columbia,
then a fraternity.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.859
And the next thing, you
will be an engineer.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.860
This is just the pledge pin.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.028
I get the real pin before long.

09:55.128 --> 10:00.801
And when I get it, I'm supposed
to give it to my best girl.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.804
You still my best girl, Ma?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.806
Always.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.975
It'll mean you'll have
to go steady with me.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.943
You can't even look
at anybody else.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.646
Not even Papa?

10:12.780 --> 10:13.480
All right, Papa.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.986
Well, Sam, I'm going
to build my football

10:19.119 --> 10:22.622
team around a new man next
fall, a great half back.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.295
Somebody gunning for you, Jim?

10:28.428 --> 10:31.665
Well, I guess it's always
open season on football coaches,

10:31.799 --> 10:33.633
especially you sportswriters.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.103
Oh, say, that's the half back
I was telling you about, Lou

10:36.236 --> 10:37.771
Gehrig, a line-plunging fool.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.072
Football?

10:39.172 --> 10:40.440
For a kid that can hit
a baseball this far?

10:40.573 --> 10:42.743
Well, Sam, there's
a pretty stiff

10:42.843 --> 10:43.911
wind blowing this direction.

10:44.011 --> 10:44.945
Yeah, and that
wind could blow him

10:45.078 --> 10:45.979
right into the major leagues.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.247
Oh,no, lay off, will ya, Sam?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.648
That's what happened
to Eddie Collins,

10:48.782 --> 10:50.450
the greatest second baseman
we ever had at Columbia.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.919
It's spread all over
the sports pages,

10:52.019 --> 10:52.986
and the first
thing we know, he's

10:53.120 --> 10:54.688
playing professional baseball.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.423
Lay off of this
kid, will ya, Sam?

10:56.489 --> 11:00.660
I'm a newspaper man, Jim,
and that sure was some wallop.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.132
All right, of you
won't introduce me,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.902
then I'll just go right
up and introduce myself.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.705
I simply can't dare
not meeting him.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.640
Oh, Mr. Gehrig?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.010
I suppose you'll think
I'm terribly fresh,

11:50.143 --> 11:52.645
but I just couldn't
stand it another minute.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.514
Lou, you seemed to
have made a conquest.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.484
Mile-a-minute Myra, the
All-American prom-trotter.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.888
Miss Tinsley, may I
present Mr. Gehrig?

12:01.021 --> 12:02.089
How do you do?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.057
I do, Mr. Gehrig,
is just wonderful.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.259
What chance have I got
against a great athlete?

12:06.393 --> 12:09.062
Pay no attention to me, you
two, I'll just go away somewhere

12:09.196 --> 12:10.530
and drink myself to death.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.104
Aren't you going
to ask me to dance?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.672
Wouldn't you condescend to
dance with a little Miss

12:19.739 --> 12:21.608
Nobody like me?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.577
I guess I don't dance
very well, Miss Tinsley.

12:24.711 --> 12:27.180
Oh, you and your modesty.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.918
Athletes do everything well.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.853
Don't you want to dance with me?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.926
Would you care to
dance, Miss Tinsley?

12:39.059 --> 12:40.560
I'd adore to.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.082
I could just die
dancing with you.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.654
But it seems such
a waste of time.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
I want to talk to you.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.625
I know a place where we
can be all by our lonesome.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.094
It'll be just wonderful.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.935
You know what?

13:22.069 --> 13:23.570
I never danced
before in my life.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.737
Oh, now.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.106
I wouldn't kid ya.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.407
I'd never kid you.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.981
I was scared stiff,
Miss Tinsley.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.516
Myra.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.818
Myra.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.121
Would you like to dance again?

13:41.188 --> 13:42.322
Later.

13:42.455 --> 13:46.026
First, I want to
know all about you.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.261
Now, Go on, tell me.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.662
There isn't anything.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.500
Ah, now, a great big
famous person like you?

13:53.633 --> 13:57.137
Well, you've even had
your name in the paper.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.773
Tell me, do you
just adore baseball?

14:00.840 --> 14:04.111
You see, I'm not going
to be a ballplayer.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.047
Mom wants me to be an engineer.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.715
And you're going to do
what your mother wants?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.617
Of course.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.886
I think that's--

14:13.020 --> 14:14.687
that's just adorable.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.623
You're going to be an old
engineer who never gets

14:16.689 --> 14:18.558
his name in the
paper or anything,

14:18.691 --> 14:21.028
just because your
mother wants you to.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.197
You're wonderful.

14:24.331 --> 14:27.000
You're the one
that's wonderful.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.235
Now, Mr. Gehrig.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.404
Lou.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.979
Are you going to
remember me, Lou?

14:39.079 --> 14:42.315
Remember you?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.251
Maybe these will help you to.

14:48.755 --> 14:53.593
Of course, they will,
because they're like you.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.762
(SINGING) Night and
day time, always play--

14:55.895 --> 14:57.030
Hey, Mira.

14:57.164 --> 14:57.998
Where have you been?

14:58.065 --> 14:59.366
How about our dance?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.734
Oh.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.736
Excuse me, Lou?

15:50.117 --> 15:53.586
[whistling]

16:15.508 --> 16:18.911
Well, here he is now,
the pride of the ballroom.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.147
Quit kidding, will ya?

16:20.280 --> 16:23.283
I wouldn't kid you.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.985
I'd never kid you.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.787
Come on, come on, eats.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.421
Nice work, Lou.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.691
You're wonderful.

16:31.824 --> 16:32.925
No, I'm not.

16:32.992 --> 16:37.297
You're the one that's wonderful.

16:37.430 --> 16:41.501
What are you going to
be when you grow up, Van?

16:41.634 --> 16:44.637
Well, I'd like to be
a great big fireman,

16:44.704 --> 16:46.173
because I'm so good at it.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.476
But the mater won't let me,
she wants me to be a motorman.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.010
Hey, what is all this?

16:51.144 --> 16:54.714
Oh, Van, even though the big
league teams are begging you

16:54.847 --> 16:58.218
on their bended knees to join
them, you will remember us,

16:58.351 --> 16:59.686
won't you?

16:59.786 --> 17:02.455
Why, I don't need anything
to make me remember you.

17:02.555 --> 17:08.994
But I'd like to have the these
because they're like you.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.737
Lou, hey, Lou.

17:17.869 --> 17:18.570
Hey.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.173
Lou.

17:20.240 --> 17:20.973
Lou.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.981
He was only joking, Lou.

17:32.819 --> 17:33.520
Lou.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.231
Lou.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.233
Oh, Lou, there's a fellow
from the Yankees looking for ya.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.200
- Oh, more jokes, huh?
- No.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.000
Gehrig?

17:48.101 --> 17:49.269
My name's Blake.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.570
Miller Huggins of
the Yankees says he--

17:50.670 --> 17:51.838
Oh, you're trying
to be funny too, huh?

17:51.938 --> 17:53.573
Hey, wait a minute.

18:03.216 --> 18:03.916
Say, Lou?

18:06.953 --> 18:09.456
What made you give Mr. Blake
the rush act last night?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.259
He came up to your fraternity
house to do you a favor.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.360
You mean that he--

18:13.426 --> 18:14.461
you mean that you want to--

18:14.594 --> 18:15.462
Now, wait a minute.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.763
Let's start all over again.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.065
This is Sam Blake of
the "Evening Standard."

18:19.132 --> 18:21.768
Lou Gehrig.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.570
There's no law
that says you have

18:23.636 --> 18:26.105
to played with the Yankees,
but it's no insult to be asked.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.540
Yankees?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.442
You mean the New York Yankees?

18:29.609 --> 18:32.445
Not the Chillicothe Yankees.

18:32.545 --> 18:36.949
Oh, thanks.

18:37.083 --> 18:42.755
Gee, that's wonderful, but
I'm going to be an engineer.

18:53.900 --> 18:54.601
Engineer.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.943
POP GEHRIG: Don't
get up, Mother.

19:04.076 --> 19:04.644
I'll get it for you.

19:04.777 --> 19:05.945
MA GEHRIG: I can do it.

19:06.012 --> 19:06.946
I'm all right.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.915
POP GEHRIG: No, you
are not all right.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.283
You stay here.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.251
What's the matter, Pop?

19:11.351 --> 19:12.252
POP GEHRIG: Mama's sick.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.653
MA GEHRIG: It's nothing.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.488
POP GEHRIG: It's something, Lou.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.190
I'll get a doctor.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.958
MA GEHRIG: Never
mind, he'll cost $2.

19:19.025 --> 19:19.759
I'll get him.

19:51.891 --> 19:56.062
We must get your wife to
the hospital immediately.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.798
The General Hospital is
really crowded just now,

19:58.898 --> 20:01.968
but I'll see if I can
make arrangements.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.476
There must be room
in one of the wards.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.043
Ma's not going to a ward.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.145
She's going to have the best
of everything, a good room

20:13.212 --> 20:14.314
in a private hospital.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.549
But beggars can't be choosers.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.018
A private hospital
costs money, and where

20:19.151 --> 20:21.421
are we going to get it?

20:21.554 --> 20:22.522
I know where I can get it.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.656
Tell the doc not to bother.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.558
I'll make all the arrangements.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.737
Aren't you even going to
read what you're signing?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.706
No, I'm in a hurry.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.207
Well, just in case
you're interested,

20:41.341 --> 20:45.745
you're the property of the
New York Yankees from now on.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.582
Only, I think we'll have to
smooth off the rough edges.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.384
Now, to start with,
I'm going to send

20:51.518 --> 20:53.586
you up to play with Hartford.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.721
Here you are.
- Thank you.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.055
Bye.
Bye, Blake.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.189
Bye.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.191
Try to keep your
afternoons free, will ya?

20:59.292 --> 21:01.461
LOU: Sure, sure.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.195
Maybe he signed
with the wrong team.

21:03.296 --> 21:06.299
He's nutty enough to play
with the Brooklyn Dodgers.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.867
You'll never be
sorry you signed him.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.441
That's wonderful,
Louie, wonderful.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.909
But one thing I
don't understand,

21:16.976 --> 21:19.278
they send you from
New York to Hartford

21:19.412 --> 21:21.714
to bring you back to New York.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.916
I will never understand America.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.318
You see, they're
sending me there

21:25.452 --> 21:26.619
for the experience I need.

21:26.753 --> 21:27.587
That's the way they work it.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.289
Uh-huh.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.058
How are you going to work it?

21:32.124 --> 21:32.925
Work what?

21:33.059 --> 21:34.160
Mama.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.127
Oh.

21:35.261 --> 21:35.962
MA GEHRIG: Louie.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.468
How's my best girl?

21:41.601 --> 21:42.301
Fine.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.236
Fine.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.073
Mama, I've got to
go make a phone call.

21:47.173 --> 21:50.009
Hey, wait a minute,
grab a hold of that.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.515
How they treating you, Ma?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.349
Wonderful.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.917
Good.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.588
I can't get over how much
they give you here for nothing.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.491
Why, all the city
hospitals are free, Ma.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.793
Everybody treats
me like a queen.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.601
Mom?

22:14.701 --> 22:16.002
Yes, Louie?

22:16.135 --> 22:17.303
I want to tell you something.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.170
Excuse me a minute.

22:22.108 --> 22:25.478
It's-- it's
nothing, Mom, really.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.447
I'm going away, Mom.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.382
I'm going to Hartford.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.050
You see, Mom, I--

22:31.183 --> 22:32.852
Harvard.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.654
Harvard.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.623
That's wonderful.

22:36.723 --> 22:41.060
Oh, Louie, you are going
to be a great engineer,

22:41.193 --> 22:44.163
and Harvard's engineering
school is good, huh?

22:47.199 --> 22:50.803
But, Louie, suppose she
finds out, what about me?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.639
Protect yourself
in the clinches, Pop.

22:52.739 --> 22:53.540
What about mail?

22:53.673 --> 22:55.708
Suppose Mom writes you?

22:55.842 --> 22:57.810
She'll write the
letters, but you mail them.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.879
What about the money
you will be sending me?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.514
How will I explain that?

23:01.581 --> 23:02.749
Tell her you got a job.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.250
Job?
Who?

23:04.383 --> 23:05.084
Me?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.052
You.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.887
Louie, wait.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.589
What kind of a job?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.023
Well, that's up to you.

23:11.090 --> 23:11.991
All aboard.

23:20.232 --> 23:20.933
Politics.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.667
Good morning, Mrs. Gehrig.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.768
Good morning, Roberts.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.169
You saw the papers?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.137
Papers?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.272
The one says white,
the other black.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.240
I never read them.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.775
You must be very
proud of your son.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.311
My Lou, of course, but
I just can't get over

24:39.445 --> 24:43.115
how wonderful everything is
with my husband, Mr. Gehrig,

24:43.182 --> 24:44.984
you know?

24:45.117 --> 24:46.919
My husband told
me in the hospital

24:46.986 --> 24:49.321
how wonderful his job was.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.257
I couldn't believe it.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.326
You want to know when
he leaves for work?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.095
When he feels like it.

24:56.162 --> 25:00.099
When he doesn't feel like it,
he doesn't go to work at all.

25:00.199 --> 25:04.336
Political, at $25 a week.

25:04.470 --> 25:05.304
Wow.

25:05.437 --> 25:05.938
Wow.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.206
What is it, Papa?

25:11.611 --> 25:12.645
What's the matter?

25:12.779 --> 25:14.046
Nothing.

25:14.180 --> 25:14.847
Nothing.

25:14.947 --> 25:15.848
- Now, what?
- Nothing.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.183
[doorbell]

25:17.316 --> 25:19.719
Oh, I couldn't wait for
you to come to the door.

25:19.852 --> 25:20.853
It's in the papers.

25:20.987 --> 25:21.821
[interposing voices]

25:21.954 --> 25:22.655
Gee, ain't it wonderful?

25:22.789 --> 25:23.623
Shut up.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.624
This is great news.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.692
You should be a proud father.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.526
You'll tell me later.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.629
[interposing voices]

25:29.696 --> 25:31.831
What is it all about?

25:31.964 --> 25:35.534
Didn't you read in
the paper about Lou?

25:35.668 --> 25:36.402
MA GEHRIG: Paper?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.236
Lou?

25:37.369 --> 25:38.137
Here it is.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.006
Read it.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.507
Yes.

25:41.641 --> 25:44.677
Gehrig recalled by--

25:44.811 --> 25:45.578
by Yankees.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.386
We'll talk about it later.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.856
We'll talk about it now.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.325
LOU: Ma?

25:59.425 --> 26:02.595
[interposing voices]

26:10.436 --> 26:12.905
If you don't mind, I think
there a few things I ought

26:13.039 --> 26:14.707
to talk over with the folks.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.243
[interposing voices]

26:21.681 --> 26:26.018
Well, how's my best girl, huh?

26:26.118 --> 26:28.120
I better go too.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.255
Where?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.057
To work?

26:31.123 --> 26:32.925
I'll be right back, Louie.

26:36.528 --> 26:37.229
Mom?

26:44.637 --> 26:45.872
Mom?

26:45.972 --> 26:48.941
About Hartford, I didn't
go there just because I

26:49.075 --> 26:50.977
wanted to play baseball.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.379
I went because we
needed the money.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.215
You were sick and the
doctor said you might die.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.551
I wish I had died
rather than see you

26:59.652 --> 27:01.721
give up everything we planned.

27:01.821 --> 27:02.554
For what?

27:02.655 --> 27:04.590
To play ball.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.093
A disgrace like that.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.762
It's not such a disgrace
to play for the Yankees.

27:09.896 --> 27:12.498
That's what we
came to America for.

27:12.631 --> 27:18.470
A wonderful country where
everybody has an equal chance.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.808
That's why you studied,
why you went to Columbia,

27:21.941 --> 27:24.510
so that you could play baseball.

27:24.643 --> 27:29.949
After all my plans for you to
follow after your Uncle Otto.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.150
Uncle Otto's dead.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.086
Yes, and he'd turn
over in his grave

27:34.153 --> 27:37.356
if he knew what
happened in the family.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.257
Mom?

27:44.130 --> 27:45.932
People have to live
their own lives.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.633
Nobody can live it for you.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.601
Nobody could have made a
ballplayer out of Uncle Otto,

27:49.668 --> 27:52.138
and nobody can make anything
but a ballplayer out of me.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.373
Oh, you are good for nothing.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.143
All baseballers are
good for nothing.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.111
Loafers in short pants.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.455
Mom?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.690
You've never been
to a ball game.

28:11.858 --> 28:15.227
Lots of people go every day
men, women, and children.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.363
Maybe there's something to it.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.899
Maybe it's fun.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.500
Why don't you come
out some afternoon

28:21.567 --> 28:25.872
and watch me play so you can
judge for yourself, huh, Mom?

28:26.005 --> 28:27.006
What do you say?

28:27.139 --> 28:28.140
MA GEHRIG: Never, never.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.658
You sure we came to
the right ballpark?

28:46.725 --> 28:47.426
Yes.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.398
And those are not the players?

28:52.531 --> 28:55.501
They are getting
the field ready, Mama.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.938
What do they do
with the pillows?

28:59.071 --> 29:00.506
They are not pillows.

29:00.606 --> 29:01.207
They are bases.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.875
You slide into them.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.544
I slide into them?

29:05.677 --> 29:07.847
Just watch, Mama, huh?

29:07.914 --> 29:08.614
Just watch.

30:38.670 --> 30:42.508
I can't understand it, so
many people with nothing to do.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.710
Scorecard, get your
scorecard, folks.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.046
You can't tell the players
without a scorecard, lady.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.680
My own son, I can tell.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.616
The others are none
of my business.

30:50.716 --> 30:51.650
Is your son playing?

30:51.783 --> 30:52.551
Sure.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.385
Lou Gehrig.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.320
Gehrig?

30:54.386 --> 30:55.521
Never heard of him.

30:55.654 --> 30:56.355
Substitute?

30:56.488 --> 30:57.023
No.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.724
Yankee.

30:58.857 --> 31:03.195
Scorecard, get your
scorecard, folks.

31:03.329 --> 31:04.964
Hello, Babe.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.698
Hello, boys, how are ya?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.868
Hey, Babe, was that
homer yesterday 38 or 39?

31:10.002 --> 31:12.671
Don't know, but I'll
hit 'em and you count 'em.

31:20.812 --> 31:22.048
Where's Lou?

31:22.181 --> 31:24.083
I don't see him.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.385
You sure we came to
the right ballpark?

32:03.789 --> 32:06.592
What did you say the
name of this genius was?

32:06.725 --> 32:07.859
Gehrig.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.628
Henry Louis Gehrig.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.231
$5 will get you $10, you
don't remember any part of it

32:12.364 --> 32:13.099
next year.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.866
Henry Blotto Gehrig.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.811
Come on, Sam,
give me the ball.

32:25.944 --> 32:26.745
Will you give me the ball?

32:32.818 --> 32:34.320
[bell ringing]

32:40.959 --> 32:41.660
Gehrig.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.133
I want you to keep
your eye on Wally Pipp

32:47.266 --> 32:49.001
out there on first base.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.937
Now, I know you can hit, but
fielding is important too.

32:52.004 --> 32:52.738
Yeah.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.348
HECKLER 1: What's
the matter, Wally?

33:36.482 --> 33:37.983
You getting weak?
Hit it.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.051
HECKLER 2: It's down the middle.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.886
Can't you see them?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.321
Come on, Wally.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.323
Take your time, Wally old boy.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.524
You can do it.

33:48.794 --> 33:49.495
Strike.

33:53.999 --> 33:54.866
Time.

33:55.000 --> 33:55.701
Time.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.642
Better take me out, Miller.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.078
I've been seeing double since
I was beaned the other day.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.146
That's a tough break, Wally.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.147
Have Doc look you over.

34:08.246 --> 34:08.980
OK.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.717
Too bad.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.351
Hey, Gehrig?

34:13.418 --> 34:14.753
Who me?

34:14.886 --> 34:15.587
Yes, you.

34:22.060 --> 34:22.928
Tangle foot.

34:29.034 --> 34:29.868
Never mind that.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.670
Get in there Pipp.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.239
Now, get a hold of one, kid.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.907
I know you can do it.
- OK.

34:36.041 --> 34:36.842
Lot of pepper.

34:36.908 --> 34:37.775
Lot of pepper.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.523
ANNOUNCER: Gehrig
now batting for Pipp.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.259
You started
something, Eleanor.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.860
Didn't I?

34:55.927 --> 34:57.263
Dreadful, isn't it?

34:57.429 --> 35:00.031
I seemed to have tied
a label on that rookie.

35:12.244 --> 35:12.978
Safe.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.069
Omit flowers, please.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.605
Are you putting a jinx on him?

35:39.738 --> 35:43.108
Oh, no, no, Sam, but you
ought to have a nurse around.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.243
Are you OK?

35:44.343 --> 35:45.811
I'm OK.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.480
Better get to the clubhouse,
have the Doc look you over.

35:48.614 --> 35:49.681
I'm all right, Mr. Huggins.

35:49.815 --> 35:50.949
Don't take me out now.

35:51.016 --> 35:52.351
I've been waiting
too long to get in.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.619
What do we have to do?

35:53.685 --> 35:55.454
Kill you to get you
out of the lineup?

36:19.345 --> 36:20.846
Babe, we're waiting for ya.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.781
What will it be
tonight, Mr. Ruth?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.516
Well, I'll have
a couple of those,

36:24.683 --> 36:26.652
smothered with pork chops.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.053
Take it easy, Babe.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.020
And mushrooms.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.526
Maybe some nice fish?

36:34.660 --> 36:35.627
Say, that's an idea.

36:40.666 --> 36:42.334
Ah, the Yankees.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.571
Enjoying your stay in Chicago?

36:45.704 --> 36:46.505
Hello, losers.

36:46.572 --> 36:47.739
Hello, Mr. Twitchell.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.575
Gotta let them win
once in a while.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.413
Hey.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.548
There's your friend, the
Hot Dog King's daughter.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.219
Yeah, tell them to bring some
horseshoes with them when they

37:01.353 --> 37:02.521
come to New York next spring.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.156
Oh, you can't win with alibis.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.058
Oh, we weren't alibiing.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.093
Hey, how's Tanglefoot?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.895
Has he come to yet,
or can't you tell?

37:10.028 --> 37:13.265
Hey, you gave that Rookie an
awful riding out there today.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.601
Have you made up your
mind yet, Miss Twitchell?

37:15.734 --> 37:18.937
Yeah, I think I'll have
some lamb chops and pineapple.

37:30.682 --> 37:31.717
Hello, Mr. Blake.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.357
Tanglefoot.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.696
Miss Twitchell, Mr. Gehrig.

37:56.542 --> 37:59.244
All right, we're even.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.747
Well, if we're even, maybe
you'll sit down with us?

38:05.250 --> 38:07.118
You're not going to
pull it out, are you?

38:07.252 --> 38:08.119
Oh, no, no.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.633
Well, Mr. Gehrig, I hear
this was your first game today.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.802
My first appearance,
and am I glad to get

38:23.902 --> 38:26.638
out of the lumber business, but
you don't know what that means.

38:26.772 --> 38:27.573
That means that you--

38:27.639 --> 38:29.274
I know what it means.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.842
What does it mean?

38:30.976 --> 38:32.978
Picking splinters off your
pants from sitting on the bench

38:33.078 --> 38:33.912
so long.

38:34.012 --> 38:34.746
I see.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.519
How long do you expect to
stay off the bench, Mr. Gehrig?

38:40.652 --> 38:42.754
Well, I tell ya, I've
got a hunch I'm going

38:42.854 --> 38:44.690
to be playing for a long while.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.758
Wally Pipp must be awful sick.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.861
Say, what are you
doing with this Yankee?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.329
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Mr. Twitchell.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.364
This is my father, Mr. Gehrig.

38:52.498 --> 38:53.665
How do you do?

38:53.799 --> 38:54.633
Oh, the Yankee's new
first baseman, huh?

38:54.766 --> 38:56.034
Yes, sir, at last.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.636
I like the way you stand
up to the ball, Gehrig.

38:57.703 --> 38:58.604
A lot of power there.

38:58.704 --> 38:59.705
Thank you.

38:59.838 --> 39:00.606
I see your father
knows a baseball

39:00.706 --> 39:01.807
player when he sees one.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.509
Yes, he stands up
to the plate fine.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.943
Yes, he does.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.046
He falls down on the bats
pretty good too, Dad.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.849
Mr. Tanglefoot.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.384
Won't you join
us, Mr. Twitchell?

39:12.518 --> 39:13.218
Oh, thank you.

39:18.990 --> 39:22.461
Say, uh, Blake, you
know a lot about women.

39:22.528 --> 39:23.228
Huh?

39:23.361 --> 39:24.896
Oh, yeah, sure.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.836
What does it mean when
a girl says you remind

39:30.902 --> 39:33.238
her of a Newfoundland puppy?

39:33.371 --> 39:37.075
Well, if it was an
Airedale that would be bad,

39:37.208 --> 39:44.049
or a police dog would be fatal,
but a Newfoundland puppy,

39:44.149 --> 39:45.717
I'd see her again if I was you.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.544
I think he's got
a pinochle deck.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.312
Hey, where have you been, son?

40:51.883 --> 40:55.320
Let me out of here.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.755
Boys, where's Lou?

40:56.822 --> 40:58.323
He get on the train all right?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.325
Yeah, he got on.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.927
Just hoping, that's all.

41:01.993 --> 41:05.797
Look, I've watched this
game for four hands now--

41:10.268 --> 41:12.103
[whistling]

41:15.306 --> 41:16.975
Oh, oh, you've had
some swell hats, Babe,

41:17.108 --> 41:18.844
but this one is tops.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.146
It is beautiful.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.280
Yeah?

41:22.347 --> 41:24.082
Now, listen, you mugs,
lay off of this one.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.986
If I see anyone touch it,
I'll knock his teeth in.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.755
And I'm not kidding.

41:29.821 --> 41:30.789
Oh, Babe, have a heart.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.758
Deal me in.

41:32.858 --> 41:33.925
Come on, ante up here.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.961
We can look at
it, can't we, Babe?

41:36.094 --> 41:37.763
You know, from a distance?

41:37.863 --> 41:38.964
Don't try to kid me, Mark.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.298
You busted my last one.

41:40.431 --> 41:41.132
Me?

41:41.266 --> 41:41.967
No.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.538
Well, don't look too hard.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.774
You know that's the fifth straw
hat I've bought this season,

41:48.840 --> 41:50.008
and it's the last straw.

41:50.141 --> 41:51.309
Oh, the last straw?

41:51.376 --> 41:52.510
That's a good gag, Babe.

41:55.380 --> 41:57.048
What a gag.

41:57.182 --> 41:57.683
I'm in.

41:57.816 --> 41:58.516
Give me three.

42:03.288 --> 42:03.822
Jack?

42:03.955 --> 42:05.123
- Two.
- Cy?

42:05.223 --> 42:05.957
Two.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.330
BABE: I'll bet a buck.

42:25.844 --> 42:27.746
Go ahead, butch, take a bite.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.314
If you're one of us,
you'll take a bite.

42:35.721 --> 42:36.588
Take two bites.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.096
Why, you--

42:45.230 --> 42:46.331
The busher was hungry.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.700
He didn't even
need cream and sugar.

42:48.834 --> 42:51.002
That Gehrig's the
chump of all time,

42:51.069 --> 42:52.570
fallen for a gag like that.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.105
Oh, he doesn't
know about gags.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.743
Yeah, what does he
know about, Mr. Bones?

42:57.876 --> 42:58.744
Baseball.

42:58.877 --> 43:00.712
He knows.

43:00.846 --> 43:02.113
I'll tell you something.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.916
A guy like that is a
detriment to any sport.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.685
He's a boob with a batting eye.

43:06.785 --> 43:09.888
He wakes up, brushes his teeth,
hikes out to the ballpark,

43:10.021 --> 43:12.190
hits the ball, hikes
back to the hotel room,

43:12.257 --> 43:15.093
reads the funny papers,
gargles, and goes to bed.

43:15.226 --> 43:18.196
That's personality, huh?

43:18.263 --> 43:18.764
The best.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.265
A real hero.

43:20.365 --> 43:22.300
Let me tell you
about heroes, Hank.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.035
I've covered a lot of
them, and I'm saying

43:24.102 --> 43:25.270
Gehrig is the best of the.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.437
Hm.

43:26.571 --> 43:28.940
No front page scandals,
no daffy excitements,

43:29.074 --> 43:30.575
no horn piping in the spot--

43:30.642 --> 43:31.877
No nothing.

43:31.977 --> 43:34.579
But a guy who does his
job and nothing else.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.147
He lives for his job.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.583
He gets a lot of fun out of
it, and 50 million other people

43:38.650 --> 43:39.918
get a lot of fun out of him.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.787
Watching him do something
better than anybody

43:41.920 --> 43:43.221
else ever did it before.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.924
You'd be right, Sam,
if all baseball fans

43:46.057 --> 43:47.959
were as big boobs as Gehrig.

43:48.093 --> 43:51.096
They are the same
kind of boobs as Gehrig.

43:51.162 --> 43:53.564
Only without a batting eye.

43:53.665 --> 43:55.566
That's why I'm putting
my money on Gehrig.

44:03.341 --> 44:04.676
There's a package
for you, Louie.

44:09.848 --> 44:10.916
I'll take it, Mom.

44:11.016 --> 44:12.017
I'll open it.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.488
Maybe I better pack
it just like it is.

44:17.622 --> 44:18.323
No, no.

44:18.456 --> 44:20.826
I open it.

44:20.959 --> 44:22.861
Where did you say you
play first, Louie?

44:22.994 --> 44:24.029
Chicago.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.330
It's a great town.

44:25.463 --> 44:27.598
They call me
Tanglefoot in Chicago.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.767
Tanglefoot?

44:28.867 --> 44:30.836
Yeah, only she didn't mean it.

44:30.969 --> 44:31.669
I think.

44:31.803 --> 44:34.339
Who?

44:34.472 --> 44:36.174
That's the way you
talk about a city, Mom.

44:36.307 --> 44:37.342
A city's always she.

44:37.475 --> 44:38.176
Ships too.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.681
What's this, Louie?

44:43.815 --> 44:45.483
Well, that's my new suit.

44:45.616 --> 44:48.286
You never had one
like this before.

44:48.386 --> 44:49.721
It's what they call a tuxedo.

44:49.855 --> 44:51.522
Some people call it a tux.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.658
You wear it when
you go out at night.

44:53.725 --> 44:54.459
To a smoker.

45:05.871 --> 45:10.809
Louie, am I still
your best girl?

45:10.876 --> 45:12.643
Oh.

45:12.744 --> 45:13.745
Take care of my girl, Pop.

45:30.428 --> 45:34.432
Have you seen Mr.
Twitchell lately?

45:34.565 --> 45:35.566
Twitchell?

45:35.700 --> 45:36.935
Yeah, the fellow we
met at the Rathskellar

45:37.068 --> 45:39.570
that night, remember?

45:39.704 --> 45:41.706
I didn't know he'd
made such an impression.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.577
Say you wanted to
find Mr. Twitchell, you

45:46.711 --> 45:47.678
what would you do?

45:47.745 --> 45:49.680
But I don't want to
find Mr. Twitchell.

45:49.781 --> 45:54.085
Don't worry, you're bound to run
into Eleanor one of these days.

45:54.219 --> 45:55.353
Eleanor?

45:55.420 --> 45:57.088
Yes, she'll know
where her father is.

45:57.222 --> 45:59.757
It's really quite simple.

45:59.891 --> 46:02.560
I'll bet Twitchell
misses you too.

46:21.779 --> 46:22.647
Pardon me.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.781
Hello, Miss Twitchell.

46:23.915 --> 46:24.749
Hello, Mr. Blake.

46:24.883 --> 46:25.716
With us again, hm?

46:25.817 --> 46:26.617
Back again.

46:26.751 --> 46:27.752
Is your father around?

46:27.819 --> 46:29.888
One of the boys is very
anxious to see him.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.589
Oh, who?

46:31.722 --> 46:32.790
Lou Gehrig.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.492
Oh.

46:34.625 --> 46:38.496
Oh, yes, he's talked an
awful lot about your father.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.498
He's practically talked
about nothing else.

46:40.631 --> 46:41.332
Really?

46:58.616 --> 47:01.486
Gehrig, snap out
of it, will ya?

47:01.619 --> 47:03.654
HECKLER 1: Gehrig,
what's the matter.

47:03.788 --> 47:04.655
You asleep?

47:41.492 --> 47:43.628
You did it again, mister.

47:43.694 --> 47:44.629
Here's your Doll.

47:44.729 --> 47:45.463
Would you go away?

47:45.563 --> 47:49.200
Would you please go away?

47:49.334 --> 47:50.468
All right, mister, you're next.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.869
See if you can be
as lucky as he was.

47:52.037 --> 47:54.072
How am I doing?

47:54.205 --> 47:55.173
I guess that does it.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.707
Shall we eat?

47:56.841 --> 47:59.177
Don't you want to
see me shoot first?

47:59.310 --> 48:03.081
Come on, gents,
it's only a nickel.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.216
Well, he wins a prize.

48:05.316 --> 48:06.084
Here you are, sir.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.552
That's how easy it is.

48:07.652 --> 48:09.654
That little fellow
must be awful strong.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.989
Yeah.

48:11.089 --> 48:12.590
Try it again, mister, just
to prove that wasn't a fluke.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.593
Go on, try it-- now, then
watch him, here he goes.

48:15.726 --> 48:20.065
He did it before.
he'll do it again.

48:20.198 --> 48:23.034
Well, he did it again.

48:23.101 --> 48:24.435
Hey, I've never tried that.

48:24.569 --> 48:26.237
I'll ring the bell once for you.

48:26.337 --> 48:27.172
How about eating?

48:27.238 --> 48:29.240
I'll just smack it once.

48:29.407 --> 48:30.741
There you are, sir.

48:30.841 --> 48:31.576
You're next.

48:31.709 --> 48:32.210
All right, now--

48:32.343 --> 48:33.411
He's a big fellow.

48:33.544 --> 48:34.612
I'll bet he'll probably
break the bell.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.014
Yeah.

48:36.081 --> 48:39.250
He looks like a strong fella.
he might break the machine.

48:46.757 --> 48:47.925
Well, let's eat.

48:48.059 --> 48:51.896
Oh, why, Lou, aren't you
gonna ring the bell for me?

48:52.030 --> 48:52.930
What would you like to eat?

48:53.064 --> 48:54.065
Oh, I'm really not so hungry.

48:54.199 --> 48:55.533
Go ahead and try it.

48:55.633 --> 48:56.767
The whole time
you've been here,

48:56.901 --> 48:58.236
you've been saying
how hungry you are.

48:58.303 --> 48:59.304
Well, I must have
waited too long

48:59.437 --> 49:00.938
then, because I'm
not hungry now.

49:01.072 --> 49:02.940
Oh, you, mister,
the little lady

49:03.074 --> 49:04.575
wants to see how strong you are.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.744
Don't disappoint
the little lady.

49:06.877 --> 49:07.979
Come right over.

49:08.113 --> 49:09.247
Step right up.

49:09.314 --> 49:10.881
Ring the bell, win a prize.

49:10.982 --> 49:12.150
That's all you have to do.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.951
Don't disappoint
the little lady.

49:14.085 --> 49:14.885
There you are.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.221
Test your strength.

49:16.321 --> 49:17.622
That's all there is to it.

49:17.755 --> 49:19.824
Ring the bell, and win a prize.

49:22.927 --> 49:24.762
Well, that's too bad.

49:24.895 --> 49:25.763
Try again, mister.

49:25.896 --> 49:26.764
Try again.

49:30.268 --> 49:31.669
Wait a minute, mister.

49:31.802 --> 49:32.770
Hold this.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.739
Look, you gotta get
your wrist into it.

49:34.839 --> 49:35.940
Understand?

49:36.074 --> 49:37.308
In anything athletic, you
gotta get the wrist in.

49:37.442 --> 49:38.476
Now watch me.
Stand back.

49:38.609 --> 49:39.910
Watch him, folks.
Watch him.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.012
Here he goes.
Watch him.

49:41.146 --> 49:41.979
Here he goes.

49:42.147 --> 49:43.914
Well, he did it again.

49:43.981 --> 49:44.849
See.
Here.

49:44.982 --> 49:45.983
Try it.

49:46.151 --> 49:48.786
All there is to it.

49:48.853 --> 49:49.354
Like this?

49:49.487 --> 49:53.024
Yeah, that's it.

49:53.158 --> 49:54.692
Ring the bell and win a prize.

49:58.663 --> 49:59.330
There.

49:59.464 --> 50:00.765
Beat it, brother.

50:00.831 --> 50:02.033
Now, we eat.

50:02.167 --> 50:03.434
Oh, boy.

50:03.534 --> 50:04.869
What would you like to eat?

50:05.002 --> 50:06.171
Oh, hot dogs and champagne.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.038
Good.

53:17.027 --> 53:21.699
(SINGING) I'll be
loving you always.

53:25.636 --> 53:29.139
With a love that's true always.

53:32.042 --> 53:39.083
When the things you've
planned need a helping hand,

53:39.216 --> 53:44.088
I will understand always.

53:44.221 --> 53:45.890
Always.

53:46.023 --> 53:53.498
Days may not be fair
always, that's when

53:53.564 --> 53:56.667
I'll be there always.

54:00.004 --> 54:07.445
Not for just an hour,
not for just a day,

54:07.578 --> 54:11.215
not for just a year, but always.

54:23.761 --> 54:26.597
Well, Mr. Gehrig, to
you first World Series.

54:26.764 --> 54:27.532
Oh, don't say that.

54:27.598 --> 54:28.766
Not yet.

54:28.899 --> 54:30.401
We've got six more
cities waiting for us,

54:30.535 --> 54:33.438
and anything can happen.

54:33.571 --> 54:36.607
Did you realize this is my last
night in Chicago this season?

54:36.741 --> 54:40.277
And this is goodbye?

54:40.411 --> 54:41.812
What a lot of them.

54:41.946 --> 54:45.115
Six more to go,
six more goodbyes.

54:45.249 --> 54:46.784
Six more what?

54:46.917 --> 54:49.086
Well, you play in seven
cities when you're on the road,

54:49.153 --> 54:51.822
you must have a
girl in every city?

54:51.956 --> 54:53.824
A ballplayer is a lot
like a sailor, isn't he?

54:53.958 --> 54:56.126
A girl in every port?

54:56.260 --> 54:58.896
What's Miss Boston's name?

54:58.963 --> 55:01.131
I never said I had
a girl in Boston.

55:01.298 --> 55:02.633
Haven't you?

55:02.733 --> 55:05.269
What about Philadelphia?

55:05.403 --> 55:06.837
St. Louis?
Cleveland?

55:06.971 --> 55:07.472
Detroit?

55:07.605 --> 55:08.973
Washington?

55:09.106 --> 55:10.608
New York?

55:10.741 --> 55:12.076
You forgot Chicago.

55:12.176 --> 55:13.143
ELEANOR: Chicago?

55:13.277 --> 55:16.113
Who?

55:16.180 --> 55:18.349
Aren't you my girl?

55:18.483 --> 55:20.785
Why, Lou, I don't know
what you mean by your girl.

55:20.851 --> 55:21.786
You're best girl?

55:21.919 --> 55:24.589
Is that what you mean?

55:24.655 --> 55:26.290
I guess that's what I mean.

55:26.424 --> 55:27.925
I guess I thought you were.

55:27.992 --> 55:28.659
Why?

55:28.826 --> 55:29.694
Whatever gave you that idea?

55:32.162 --> 55:33.831
I've seen you
four days in a row,

55:33.964 --> 55:36.867
and you're out with
me here tonight.

55:37.001 --> 55:39.303
Isn't that what best girls do?

55:39.370 --> 55:41.606
Is it?

55:41.706 --> 55:44.041
I wonder if I'm
going to miss you?

55:44.174 --> 55:46.444
Can't you find
out before I go?

55:46.511 --> 55:47.344
Nope.

55:47.478 --> 55:49.179
It's that too bad?

55:49.313 --> 55:52.983
Why is it like that?

55:53.117 --> 55:54.952
I have no idea.

55:55.019 --> 55:57.354
Seems silly, doesn't it?

55:57.522 --> 56:01.659
I like that tune, don't you?

56:01.726 --> 56:02.793
Dance with me?

56:17.207 --> 56:21.879
Lou, if I do miss you, I wish
I knew how much I'm going to.

56:22.012 --> 56:23.714
I wish you knew before I left.

56:23.848 --> 56:26.551
Shall I try?

56:26.684 --> 56:28.185
How?

56:28.252 --> 56:29.854
Well, shall I--

56:29.987 --> 56:32.089
Lou, where do you go from here?

56:32.222 --> 56:33.057
Detroit.

56:33.190 --> 56:35.426
All right, I'll
close my eyes and make

56:35.560 --> 56:38.896
believe it's tomorrow night, and
I'm dancing with someone else.

56:38.996 --> 56:41.599
Yeah, I get the idea, uh-huh.

56:41.732 --> 56:42.433
All right, ready?

56:46.671 --> 56:48.506
Are you in Detroit?

56:48.573 --> 56:52.443
Yep, I'm sitting in the
lobby of the Statler Hotel.

56:52.577 --> 56:54.512
Who am I dancing with?

56:54.612 --> 56:56.447
Let me see, who do I know?

56:56.581 --> 56:57.582
Harold Chandler?

56:57.715 --> 56:59.049
Bill Talbot?

56:59.116 --> 57:00.451
Jim Johnson?

57:00.585 --> 57:01.586
Jack Austin?

57:01.752 --> 57:03.921
Will Church?

57:04.021 --> 57:05.289
Sam Price?
- Hey.

57:05.422 --> 57:06.256
Hey.

57:06.390 --> 57:07.558
What?

57:07.692 --> 57:10.528
You got a ball
club of your own.

57:10.628 --> 57:11.462
I'm tired of this game.

57:11.596 --> 57:12.630
I don't like it.

57:12.763 --> 57:14.932
I'm back from Detroit.

57:15.032 --> 57:18.235
And I'm laughing again.

57:18.368 --> 57:24.809
(SINGING) Not for just an
hour, not for just a day,

57:24.942 --> 57:28.979
not for just a year, but always.

57:33.584 --> 57:34.418
All right, Babe.

57:34.552 --> 57:35.720
All right, hold it, Babe.

57:35.820 --> 57:36.554
That's it.

57:36.654 --> 57:37.988
Still.

57:38.088 --> 57:40.257
Hand the ball to the kid now.

57:40.390 --> 57:41.258
That's it, Babe.

57:41.391 --> 57:43.227
Give us a big smile, Billy.

57:43.327 --> 57:44.595
Can you sit up a little, son?

57:44.662 --> 57:46.330
Hold it.

57:46.497 --> 57:48.298
Oh, there you are, kid.

57:48.398 --> 57:50.100
Now, let's have one with
your arm around the kid.

57:50.234 --> 57:51.836
Can you look up at
Mr. Ruth now, sonny?

57:51.969 --> 57:52.670
Hold it.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.772
That's it.

57:54.839 --> 57:55.840
Just one more.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.074
Right, go right ahead.

57:57.174 --> 57:59.844
Page one on every rag
from coast to coast, or I

57:59.977 --> 58:03.848
go back to the copy desk.

58:03.981 --> 58:04.982
That's enough, boys.

58:05.115 --> 58:07.618
And once more, Billy,
I'm going to hit a home

58:07.752 --> 58:09.754
run for you this afternoon.

58:09.854 --> 58:13.357
And what's more, you
can pick your own field.

58:13.524 --> 58:15.860
Left, center, or right?

58:15.960 --> 58:16.694
What do you say?

58:16.827 --> 58:17.595
Center field?

58:17.695 --> 58:18.462
OK.

58:21.265 --> 58:21.999
Hey, Babe?

58:22.132 --> 58:23.300
Yes?

58:23.433 --> 58:24.268
I wonder if you'll
autograph this for me.

58:24.368 --> 58:25.670
I sure will.

58:25.803 --> 58:26.937
Mr. Ruth, will you
autograph mine too, please?

58:27.037 --> 58:29.974
Absolutely.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.141
Keep your chin up, Billy.

58:31.275 --> 58:32.276
Mr. Gehrig?

58:32.376 --> 58:33.544
Will you put your
name on it too?

58:33.711 --> 58:34.444
Sure.

58:45.522 --> 58:46.857
You're quite a fan, aren't ya?

58:46.957 --> 58:51.228
I haven't missed
a game this season.

58:51.361 --> 58:52.663
Oh, yeah.

58:52.730 --> 58:55.065
Thanks I like
to play baseball.

58:58.068 --> 59:01.739
You'll play again.

59:01.906 --> 59:05.209
Billy, you know there
isn't anything you can't

59:05.309 --> 59:07.745
do if you try hard enough.

59:07.878 --> 59:09.379
You think so?

59:09.479 --> 59:10.815
Why sure.

59:10.915 --> 59:15.586
Could you knock a home
run for me this afternoon?

59:15.720 --> 59:18.222
You've already been
promised one by Babe Ruth.

59:18.355 --> 59:19.857
Could ya?

59:19.990 --> 59:22.092
Well, that's a
pretty tall order.

59:26.363 --> 59:27.064
OK.

59:30.200 --> 59:32.269
Could you knock two homers?

59:32.402 --> 59:34.104
Two homers in a World Series?

59:34.238 --> 59:36.941
Well, Mr. Gehrig, you said
that you can do anything

59:37.074 --> 59:38.508
if you tried hard enough.

59:41.345 --> 59:43.781
That's what you said.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.750
Yeah.

59:45.883 --> 59:47.551
OK.

59:47.685 --> 59:51.355
I'll hit two homers for
ya, if you hit one for me?

59:51.455 --> 59:54.124
Me?

59:54.224 --> 59:56.593
You've got to promise
me that one of these days

59:56.727 --> 59:58.128
you're going to get
up out of this bed

59:58.262 --> 01:00:00.264
and go home on your own power.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:01.799
But how?

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.703
If you want to do something
hard enough, you can do it.

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:08.472
OK, we can both
do it, can't we?

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:12.476
OK.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.410
So long, Billy.

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:15.079
So long, Mr. Gehrig.

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:15.980
Lou.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:16.881
Lou.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.622
RADIO ANNOUNCER: It's
just been definitely

01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.557
announced that all threat
of rain has disappeared.

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:29.493
The World Series between
New York and St. Louis

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.663
will be resumed here this
afternoon as scheduled.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:36.901
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:39.469
this Bill Stern speaking from
Sportsman's Park in St. Louis.

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.105
This is the World Series
that will make history.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:42.406
Go down in history.

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:43.607
Be history.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:15.539
The Babe has just
stepped up to the plate.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.180
The Babe's going to
try for the home run,

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.314
but it's not for the crowd.

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:25.315
I'll tell you
something the crowd

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.616
doesn't know anything about.

01:01:26.717 --> 01:01:27.551
This one's going to
be for a little boy

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.286
in a St. Louis hospital.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:33.057
It's an IOU from the Sultan of
Swat to a little crippled kid.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.859
Will he pay it?

01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:35.659
Ball.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.537
RADIO ANNOUNCER: There
goes a home run out

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:49.173
in the center field bleachers.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:50.474
Ruth's going to first base.

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:51.876
Yankees come up out
of their dugout,

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:54.344
a smile all over the faces
of the New York Yankees.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:56.580
Miller Huggins has a grin
on his map from ear to ear.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.883
Things aren't bad enough
here in St. Louis.

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:01.385
The next man up has
to be Lou Gehrig.

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:03.187
Ruth is coming into
home plate now.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.865
Oh, Babe Ruth is
pretty good too.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:23.908
Now, Gehrig is in the batter's
box, and in just a second,

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:25.242
I think we'll be all set to g--

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:32.449
Folks, this is going to be
a great day for little Billy

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:33.951
in the hospital.

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:36.286
I've just been informed
that Lou Gehrig has promised

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.922
to hit two home runs for him.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:57.141
It's a home run for Lou Gehrig.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.208
Whoopie.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:02:59.576
RADIO ANNOUNCER: A
home run for Gehrig.

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:01.478
Gehrig puts it
right over the base.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:02.880
He really delivered.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.816
The Yankees have come
up out of their dugout,

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:07.384
Miller Huggins leading them.

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.760
What a duel, what
a duel this is.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:18.228
A batting duel
between the two Kings

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:19.396
of Clout, Ruth and Gehrig.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:20.630
Each one has knocked
out a home run,

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:21.798
but Gehrig has
promised two home runs

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.000
for that kid in the hospital.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:23.800
Can he do it?

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:26.303
Here's a $10 says he can't.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:29.139
Here's a $10 says he can.

01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:39.349
Strike.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.655
Catcher's down,
gives the signal.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:46.490
Pitcher's got the ball.

01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:49.359
Here's the wind up.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.328

RADIO ANNOUNCER: Strike two.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.432
The ball is back to the
pitcher mound, takes his time.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:07.945
Strike three, Gehrig's out.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.284
Oh, Louie didn't want
Babe Ruth to feel too bad.

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.173
It's the sixth inning now.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.407
Lou's at bat again.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.309
After that second home run
for Billy, that little boy

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:40.144
in the hospital.

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:43.580
Strike.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:46.150
Take it easy, Lou.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.551
Take it easy.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:48.885
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Gehrig seems to
be a little over anxious today.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.520
He's reaching for some bad ones.

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.323
He's trying too hard for that
second home run for that kid.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.724
That was a sucker bet, Blake.

01:04:54.858 --> 01:04:56.593
I hate to take
that $10 from you.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.594
You want to make it $20?

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:58.762
$20 it is.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.235
Come on, Lou, hit it.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.004
And he takes his bat
off his shoulder.

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:08.205
He's looking at it now.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:09.273
Maybe he things
there's a hole in it.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.121
Strike three.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:25.622
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Strike three.

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:29.293
Oh, gosh.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:33.730
Papa, maybe you better
call Lou on the long distance

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:35.132
and tell him to stop fooling.

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:48.778
Better hurry.
Better hurry.

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:49.746
Lay down.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:50.780
Safe.

01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:55.719
Now, remember,
Lou, take it easy.

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:56.653
Don't press.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:06:00.457
All we need is a single.

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:02.826
You might as well kick
in with a $20, Blake.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.461
The game isn't over yet.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:06.796
It's as good as over.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:08.232
You want to make it $30?

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.400
It's a bet.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.668
Here he is again.

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:12.602
Here he is again.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.579
Ball.

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:24.314
They're gonna pass him.

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:25.415
That's dirty pool.

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:30.687
Ball two.

01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:33.457
Last time at bat in this World
Series, and if they walk him,

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:34.991
it'll fill the bases.

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.960
That's a lot better than giving
Lou Gehrig a chance to park

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.095
that apple over the fence.

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.437
Ball three.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:48.805
Let them walk you, Lou.

01:06:48.872 --> 01:06:51.175
Let them walk you.

01:06:51.308 --> 01:06:56.313
Counts, no strikes,
three balls, two out.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.215
Here it comes.

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:12.129
If you haven't got $30, I'll
take your left leg on account.

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:23.907
What do you think of that one?

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:26.009
Two home runs in one
World Series game.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.512
He's really a man, that man.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.647
From now on, they're going
to have to spell Gehrig's

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:31.881
name in capital letters.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:34.151
Lou, Lou, Lou.

01:07:34.251 --> 01:07:36.986
Gehrig, Gehrig, Gehrig.

01:07:37.087 --> 01:07:40.424
Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:44.328
Gehrig, Gehrig,
Gehrig, Gehrig, Gehrig.

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.917
Hey, guys, how about
a half a dozen collars?

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:09.286
Go to it, boys.

01:08:11.955 --> 01:08:13.223
Mr. Gehrig?

01:08:13.357 --> 01:08:16.792
Mr. Gehrig, telegram for you.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.395
Hey, don't tear my clothes.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.111
Everything all right, Lou?

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:27.197
You live here?

01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:27.997
No.

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:29.698
What are you doing here then?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.502
I was calling on a young lady.

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:35.805
At 4:00 in the morning?

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:37.441
What for?

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:40.944
Well, if you must know, I
was calling on the young lady

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:42.546
to ask her to marry me.

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:43.880
I see.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.682
And who are you?

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.050
My name's Lou Gehrig.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.452
Lou who?

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.654
Gehrig.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.457
Yeah, you look like him too.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:55.058
I didn't recognize
you in the dark.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:56.059
My name's O'Doole.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:59.162
Glad to know you, Gehrig.

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:02.666
So you're gonna ask
her to marry ya, huh?

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:03.533
Yeah.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.743
You knocked out a couple of
homers yesterday, didn't ya?

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.045
Yeah, I got a little lucky.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:19.383
Yeah, well, hope you
have good luck today too.

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:31.094
Is Miss Twitchell at home?

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:32.596
What's she done?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.498
Nothing.

01:10:34.598 --> 01:10:35.732
Yet.

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:36.933
Wake her up and tell her
Lou Gehrig wants to see her,

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.268
will ya?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:40.069
Will you come in and
wait in the parlor?

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.671
Go on in.

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:42.606
Thank you.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.881
You're kind of fidgety, huh?

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:54.751
Oh, yes.

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:55.719
[knocking]

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:57.287
4 Eleanor?

01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:58.054
Eleanor?

01:10:58.121 --> 01:10:59.289
What is it?

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:01.458
MAID: Policeman
wants to see you.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:02.459
A policeman?

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:04.428
MAID: And a fellow
called Lou Gehrig.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.575
I guess you don't
need me anymore.

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:31.888
MA GEHRIG: Louie should
be home most any minute.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:34.424
I don't know what's keeping him.

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:38.595
Tessie, don't you see him yet?

01:11:38.728 --> 01:11:40.964
Yes.

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:43.600
I love surprise parties.

01:11:43.733 --> 01:11:46.169
Why didn't Lou home on the
same train with the team?

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.337
He missed the train.

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:48.938
He sent us a telegram.

01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:50.474
I bet Lou will
be glad to get back

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:52.676
home after all that hotel food.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.412
Yes, tonight we have
stuffed breast of veal

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:56.780
and tomorrow night fried eels.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:02.919
Tessie, no sign yet?

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:04.654
Not yet.

01:12:04.788 --> 01:12:06.255
I don't know
what's keeping him.

01:12:06.356 --> 01:12:08.825
Papa's in there fussing
with the food again.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:10.427
I give you the instructions.

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:12.261
You said you would tell Apfell.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.196
Use got it wrong.

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:14.498
You have ruined everything.

01:12:14.598 --> 01:12:15.098
Papa?

01:12:15.198 --> 01:12:16.132
What is it, Papa?

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:16.966
This fool.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.167
This dope.

01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:19.636
Ain't my fault, Mrs. Gehrig.

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:20.269
I just delivered it.

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:21.605
What happened?

01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:25.975
Look, they made Louie
a right-handed batter.

01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:27.343
I didn't even
know what it was.

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:30.680
Mr. Apfell just told
me to deliver it.

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:33.483
The only one in American that
don't know Louie is a southpaw,

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:35.184
and he has to be our baker.

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:36.886
Maybe nobody will notice.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.154
A right-hander.

01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:39.656
Tessie, now?

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:40.724
Not yet.

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:43.893
What do you think
happened to the cake.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.630
Now.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.732
[whispering]

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:57.707
Mom?

01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:00.376
Pop?

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.745
Where is everybody?

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:05.314
Surprise.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.193
Oh, Mom, this is Ellie.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:20.430
I mean, Eleanor Twitchell.

01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:23.733
Hello, Mrs. Gehrig.

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:24.901
And this is my Pop.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.203
Lou, that was some ballgame.

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:28.772
[interposing voices]

01:13:30.006 --> 01:13:32.942
Mr. Jones and Miss
Martin, and Mrs. Larsen.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:34.744
And Miss Larson.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:38.515
Well, listen, folks, there's
something I've got to tell you.

01:13:38.615 --> 01:13:41.350
Well, I guess there's only
one way to do this thing.

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:44.588
Ma or Mrs. Gehrig
meet Mrs. Gehrig.

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:45.522
Hey, what?

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:46.956
As soon as we get married.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.863
Lou's done nothing but
talk about you, Mrs. Gehrig.

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:54.731
I'm so happy.

01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:01.037
I've got some refreshments
in the other room.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.476
You know what?

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:07.877
I brought you the ball we
used in the third game.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:08.712
Did ya?

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:14.751
The trouble with you,
Mama, you are not modern.

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:18.087
A young fellow
nowadays, he's engaged.

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:20.389
He takes his girl
back to her hotel.

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:23.827
It's 10 minutes to the
hotel, 10 minutes back,

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.095
but it doesn't mean he
gets home in 20 minutes.

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:37.741
By the end of next season,
you can finish up in Chicago.

01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:41.077
Then you can come back here,
get an apartment, and fix it up.

01:14:41.177 --> 01:14:45.014
And then we'll get married.

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:46.282
And

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:48.017
I think she's giving
us a gentle hint.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.995
Lou, do you think
your mother likes me?

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:00.296
Like you?

01:15:00.429 --> 01:15:02.131
How can she help liking you?

01:15:02.265 --> 01:15:03.700
I was just wondering.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.535
She ought to be
jealous of you,

01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:07.003
because you're so
pretty and everything.

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:09.372
I'm jealous of you myself.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.374
I guess I was wrong.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:12.475
About what?

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:13.877
Oh, nothing.

01:15:14.043 --> 01:15:14.778
Night, Lou.

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:15.779
Good night.

01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:11.400
I must say, Miss,
you picked out the most

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:12.869
beautiful number in the store.

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:15.404
Ellie, if you are
looking for a chifforobe--

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:17.874
I found it, Mom,
just what I want.

01:16:18.007 --> 01:16:19.709
Isn't it lovely?

01:16:19.843 --> 01:16:21.745
Don't look very practical.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.881
And it looks secondhand too.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.383
It's an antique.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:30.854
Louie can afford
to buy new stuff.

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:33.957
I'll show you.

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:35.458
Look at that.

01:16:35.558 --> 01:16:37.226
Strong and practical.

01:16:37.293 --> 01:16:39.128
Last a lifetime.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:45.702
Mom, I've worked
out sort of a scheme.

01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:48.638
It was only a suggestion.

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:50.139
You see, the rug
in the bedroom--

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:52.108
The rug.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:53.109
You remind me.

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:54.744
I'll show you.

01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.716
Take a look at that.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:02.719
It's exactly the right
size for your living room.

01:17:02.819 --> 01:17:05.454
Oh, I was planning on
something more a pastel shade.

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:08.391
It's almost an exact
duplicate of the first rug

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.126
we had in our place.

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.161
Only more so.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.263
That's why I bought it for you.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.833
It's your wedding
present, Ellie.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:20.737
I asked them to bring it up
to see how it would look.

01:17:20.837 --> 01:17:22.338
You can live
with it for awhile,

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.073
and then if you don't like it--

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:25.241
I can send it back.

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.743
I promise, you
won't send it back.

01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:29.645
Not with a scarf on it.

01:17:29.746 --> 01:17:32.682
I just want you to let
me show you how it looks.

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:34.851
Will you let me, Ellie?

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:38.121
Certainly.

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:40.356
What's that?

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:41.791
The bedroom paper, Miss.

01:17:41.858 --> 01:17:43.359
Well, you've made a mistake.

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:45.528
That's the wrong pattern.

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.630
This is the one I selected.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:50.266
It was changed this morning.

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:51.634
Who changed it?

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.937
Isn't it beautiful?

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:56.372
But, Mama, this little
rose pattern I picked out--

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.509
I guarantee you wouldn't like
it if you saw it on the wall.

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:02.545
Neither would Louie.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.147
Lou was with me
when I picked it out.

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:05.148
He liked it.

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:06.349
Oh, men like anything.

01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:08.651
Louie, I never
give you much advice.

01:18:08.785 --> 01:18:09.953
First, you wouldn't take it.

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:13.489
Second, I've been
married 35 years, Louie,

01:18:13.556 --> 01:18:15.959
and I've learnt one thing.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:17.727
Well?

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:20.997
Can't you read between the
lines, Louie, what I'm saying.

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:23.900
It's not anything I can
say in so many words,

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:28.037
and yet it's something that
if you don't handle it right--

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:35.378
Don't say anything
about this to Mama, hm?

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:36.880
About what?

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:38.047
ELEANOR: It's all right, Mama.

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:39.849
It doesn't make that
much difference.

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:42.418
And if you don't
like the chifforobe.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:43.987
I'll probably get used to it.

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:47.190
You are very sweet, Ellie,
to admit you are wrong.

01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:58.434
Oh, look, Louie,
the same wallpaper

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.569
we had when you
were a little boy.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:01.905
What's wrong with Ellie?

01:19:02.038 --> 01:19:02.772
Ellie?

01:19:02.906 --> 01:19:03.439
Nothing.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:04.407
She just left here.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.241
What happened?

01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:06.575
Was it about this?

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:07.844
The chifforobe?

01:19:07.944 --> 01:19:09.045
It's not the one she ordered.

01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:09.712
She wanted a--

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:11.080
It wasn't practical.

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:12.348
Not even mahogany.

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:14.117
The drawers were too small.

01:19:14.217 --> 01:19:15.084
But she liked it.

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:18.888
She likes this
wallpaper too, at first.

01:19:19.022 --> 01:19:21.690
But I convinced her
that pattern was better.

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:23.426
More practical.

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.594
Well, she's very
sensible, Louie.

01:19:25.728 --> 01:19:28.297
You are lucky to
get a girl like her.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.900
That's right.

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.268
Hey.

01:19:32.401 --> 01:19:34.403
Huh?

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:35.238
Oh.

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:02.731
Ellie?

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:08.671
Just had a nice talk
with your mother-in-law.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.473
What about?

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:12.308
Lots of things.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:15.678
Mostly about interior
decorating, especially

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:18.514
wallpaper and chifforobes.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:22.318
You know that wallpaper you
picked out for the bedroom?

01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:23.752
I think it's wonderful.

01:20:27.623 --> 01:20:28.791
Your mother picked
out another pattern.

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:30.126
I know.
I saw it.

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:31.961
And it's terrible, and
so is that chifforobe.

01:20:32.095 --> 01:20:34.497
You mean the man
that just came in?

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:36.365
I mean, the one
that just went out.

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.167
I told them to take it back.

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:41.170
I'd have nightmares
looking at that thing.

01:20:41.304 --> 01:20:46.675
Lou Gehrig, I think I
could learn to like you.

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:48.811
I hope you didn't
hear Mama's feelings.

01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:50.613
I probably did, but
she'll get over it.

01:20:50.713 --> 01:20:51.948
She'll have to.

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:54.317
You can't run a baseball
team with two captains

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:56.185
or a household with two bosses.

01:20:56.319 --> 01:20:59.488
There's only going to be
one boss in this house.

01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:04.127
So you better get that apron
off and get your nose powdered.

01:21:04.227 --> 01:21:05.394
Why?

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:06.829
I just telephoned Sam
Blake to get the mayor of New

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.564
Rochelle over here right away.

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:10.199
What for?

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:12.335
I thought you
wanted to get married?

01:21:20.743 --> 01:21:23.079
Giving the ring
and join hands.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:26.049
Now, therefore, I, by virtue of
the authority reposed in me--

01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:26.882
Sh.

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:27.716
Sh.

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:38.194
I pronounce--

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:39.762
[drill]

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:49.405
I pronounce they
are man and wife.

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:50.839
Congratulations.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.214
Come on, the party is over.

01:21:58.281 --> 01:22:00.016
We've got to get this
house ready for living in.

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:01.417
Put the bathtub in there.

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:02.418
Thank you, sir.

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:03.552
Yes, sir.

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:05.021
Mr. Blake, Mr.
Blake, you better

01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:07.256
arrange right away for a
leave of absence for Louie.

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:08.057
Leave of absence?

01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:08.691
What for?

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:10.059
Your wedding trip.

01:22:10.193 --> 01:22:13.229
Atlantic City would
be a good place.

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.264
Oh, excuse me.

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:17.400
I haven't missed a game
since I joined the team.

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:18.567
I'm not going to now.

01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:20.769
Oh, he does,
I'll get a divorce.

01:22:20.903 --> 01:22:22.972
You mean, you are not
going to have a honeymoon?

01:22:23.106 --> 01:22:25.274
Of course, the Yankee Stadium.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:26.809
Say, we better get
going if Ellie wants

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:27.810
to stop and change her dress.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:28.811
Holy mackerel.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.279
I'll miss batting practice.

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:49.165
[sirens]

01:23:03.246 --> 01:23:04.113
Pull over.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:17.426
50 miles an hour
on a thoroughfare.

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:20.029
55 to be exact, Officer.

01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:21.664
I know it's terrible,
but it'll be

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:24.467
terrible if we don't get to the
Yankee Stadium in 15 minutes.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.469
Oh, yeah, it'll be terrible
if you don't get there

01:23:26.602 --> 01:23:28.204
for the start of the game.

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.806
It would be terrible if
Lou Gehrig doesn't get there

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:32.975
for the start of the game.

01:23:33.109 --> 01:23:34.043
You know, he hasn't
missed a game

01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:36.779
since he joined the Yankees.

01:23:36.879 --> 01:23:38.681
Who'd you say?

01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:40.616
Lou Gehrig.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.652
Oh, hello, Mr. Gehrig.

01:23:43.719 --> 01:23:44.453
Hi, Officers.

01:23:44.553 --> 01:23:45.388
This is Mrs. Gehrig.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:46.689
How do you do?

01:23:46.789 --> 01:23:48.691
This is our 10th
wedding anniversary.

01:23:48.824 --> 01:23:50.693
We've been married 10 minutes.

01:23:50.826 --> 01:23:51.860
Oh, you just got married?

01:23:51.994 --> 01:23:53.028
What do you know about that?

01:23:53.162 --> 01:23:54.163
Pardon me,
Officer, but the game

01:23:54.297 --> 01:23:55.898
starts in exactly 14 minutes.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.233
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:58.667
You want to get pinched
for holding up traffic?

01:24:05.074 --> 01:24:06.575
Who you got there, Joe?

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:07.543
Lou Gehrig.

01:24:07.676 --> 01:24:09.978
He's late for the game.

01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:11.547
It's Lou Gehrig.

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:12.515
Come on.

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:35.104
Strike.

01:24:35.238 --> 01:24:39.442
That's the way to go in there.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:40.409
What are you doing, Lou?

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:42.345
Knocking the rice
off your spikes?

01:24:50.119 --> 01:24:51.620
All right, pitch to me now.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.567
That was a thank
you for marrying me.

01:25:04.567 --> 01:25:05.701
What?

01:25:05.801 --> 01:25:08.036
That was a thank
you for marrying me.

01:25:08.137 --> 01:25:09.438
What?

01:25:09.538 --> 01:25:12.040
He says that was thank
you for marrying him.

01:25:12.141 --> 01:25:14.977
And we thank you too.

01:25:15.077 --> 01:25:15.911
You're welcome.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.920
Not so bad for a guy who
nobody was going to remember.

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.290
One more kissing the
bride, huh, Mr. Gehrig?

01:25:27.423 --> 01:25:28.424
OK.

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:29.258
Oh, that's terrific.

01:25:29.392 --> 01:25:31.460
Hold it.

01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:33.061
Thank you, Mr. Gehrig.

01:25:33.162 --> 01:25:36.965
Now, what about the one where
the bride kisses the groom?

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.667
I never know you
were such a hound

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.102
for publicity, Mr. Gehrig.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:41.604
Publicity?

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:43.272
I don't even care if there's
no film in their cameras.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.073
All right, here we go.

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:45.908
Hold it.

01:25:46.008 --> 01:25:47.243
Hold it.

01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:48.777
OK.

01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:50.913
A girl's gotta breathe.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.081
Well, best of
luck to you, Lou.

01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:54.183
Thanks, Babe.

01:25:54.317 --> 01:25:55.618
You'll get a great play
on these pictures, boys,

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:57.186
taken the day that
Lou won all three

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:59.154
American League Championships,
batting average, home runs.

01:25:59.288 --> 01:26:03.659
You got it wrong, boys,
this is the day I got married.

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:04.860
Oh, that's a good one.

01:26:09.164 --> 01:26:10.766
You've got to forgive
me, honey, I was held up.

01:26:10.866 --> 01:26:12.668
The boss had a brainstorm.

01:26:12.768 --> 01:26:14.203
He gambled for two hours.

01:26:14.337 --> 01:26:16.939
Finally, I said, look, Boss,
this is Lou Gehrig's birthday.

01:26:17.039 --> 01:26:19.675
I'm master of
ceremonies, so goodbye.

01:26:19.775 --> 01:26:21.510
How are you anyway?

01:26:21.644 --> 01:26:23.312
I suppose Lou's sore at me, huh?

01:26:23.446 --> 01:26:26.382
I wouldn't know.

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:27.216
What's going on here?

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:28.717
Where's Lou?

01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:30.853
I was hoping he was with you.

01:26:30.953 --> 01:26:31.954
With me?

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.791
Did he say-- well, I did
see him after the game.

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:37.460
He--

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.662
What time was that?

01:26:39.795 --> 01:26:41.464
Well, it was kind of late.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:43.866
You see, we hung
around for a while.

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:51.807
See, what'd he say
when he telephoned?

01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:54.176
He didn't telephone.

01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:56.812
Well, he-- he was
probably detained somewhere,

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:58.213
maybe something important.

01:26:58.347 --> 01:26:59.682
No doubt.

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:02.485
Oh, Ellie, don't be like that.

01:27:02.651 --> 01:27:03.886
You don't know
how lucky you are.

01:27:03.986 --> 01:27:05.187
Most women, when their
husbands are late,

01:27:05.321 --> 01:27:07.423
they got to worry,
because he's either drunk

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:09.224
or run into a dame or something.

01:27:09.358 --> 01:27:11.694
But you with Lou, boy,
all you've got to do

01:27:11.827 --> 01:27:14.530
is sit pretty and smile.

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:15.698
I'll bet this is
the first time he's

01:27:15.831 --> 01:27:18.667
late since he's married ya.

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:22.405
This is the fourth time, Sam.

01:27:22.505 --> 01:27:23.872
Well, that's nothing.

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:27.576
4 times in 10 weeks, that's
perfectly understandable.

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:29.612
Have you tried
calling up anywhere?

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.079
I don't have to call up.

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.781
I know where he is.

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:34.417
Now, Ellie, don't
talk like that.

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:36.118
You know Lou is true blue.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:36.919
That's what you think.

01:27:37.019 --> 01:27:38.253
And don't get hysterical.

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:39.388
Things like this
happen all the--

01:27:39.522 --> 01:27:40.589
I'm not hysterical.

01:27:40.723 --> 01:27:42.758
I'm perfectly controlled.

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.727
Just learned to face the facts.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:45.728
Well, where you going?

01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:46.762
I'm going to get him.

01:27:46.862 --> 01:27:48.063
Well, you can't do that.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.031
Oh, yes, I can.

01:27:49.131 --> 01:27:50.799
Ellie, I tell
you you're wrong.

01:27:50.933 --> 01:27:52.901
There's some explanation that
doesn't appear on the surface.

01:27:57.306 --> 01:27:59.141
You know where he is?

01:27:59.241 --> 01:28:00.409
Yes.

01:28:00.543 --> 01:28:01.377
You sure?

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:03.111
Yes.

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:04.313
How'd you find out?

01:28:04.447 --> 01:28:06.715
I caught him.

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:09.151
I don't believe it.

01:28:09.251 --> 01:28:10.285
I can't believe it.

01:28:10.419 --> 01:28:11.487
Ellie, you've got to go back.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.121
You can't walk in
on them like this.

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:14.289
Yes, I can.

01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:15.591
I tell you you can't
afford to make a scandal.

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:16.492
Think of the fans.

01:28:16.592 --> 01:28:17.560
Think how they'll feel.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.427
Can't.

01:28:18.561 --> 01:28:19.662
I'm too selfish.

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:23.599
Almost killed my
faith in human nature.

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:26.602
Lou Gehrig.

01:28:26.735 --> 01:28:29.972
A guy with a wife like you.

01:28:30.105 --> 01:28:33.308
Well, pal or no pal, I'm
going to take a baseball bat

01:28:33.442 --> 01:28:35.811
and bust his skull wide open.

01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:38.847
I'm going to make him
wish he was never born.

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:41.817
I'm going to hound that guy
for the rest of his life.

01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:57.933
Well, of all the
dirty, low down tricks.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.703
You almost made me have
a nervous breakdown.

01:29:04.106 --> 01:29:05.674
What's the score, Lou?

01:29:05.774 --> 01:29:07.476
23 to 22, end of the ninth.

01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:08.310
Three men on bases.

01:29:12.047 --> 01:29:14.049
He'll be right along now.

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.718
Don't talk to me, you Borgia.

01:29:44.513 --> 01:29:46.181
Dad was right.

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:50.052
He knew a ballplayer
when he saw one.

01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.820
When you said that,
the Chicago Rathskeller

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.189
jumped right up in my lap.

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.692
That wasn't yesterday,
was it, Tanglefoot?

01:29:56.825 --> 01:29:58.160
No.

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:01.263
I sure didn't know what I
was walking into that day.

01:30:01.363 --> 01:30:04.032
Mr. Gehrig, meet
Miss Twitchell, and I

01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:07.503
left my little world behind me.

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:08.403
Your world?

01:30:08.504 --> 01:30:10.405
What do you mean?

01:30:10.539 --> 01:30:12.074
Baseball life's so different.

01:30:12.207 --> 01:30:16.178
It's sort of a little
world all by itself.

01:30:16.278 --> 01:30:18.447
You play it in the
spring, summer, and fall,

01:30:18.547 --> 01:30:20.583
and talk about it in winter.

01:30:20.716 --> 01:30:22.718
You really eat,
drink, and sleep it.

01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:25.187
Yes, you have
had a dish of it.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:32.695
And here it is, spring again.

01:30:32.795 --> 01:30:34.062
Some Spring.

01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:35.698
Spring for a ballplayer.

01:30:35.798 --> 01:30:37.800
Florida next week again.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:39.301
Look, how's this?

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:43.405
I suppose these spring
training trips must

01:30:43.539 --> 01:30:44.740
be kind of dull for a girl.

01:30:44.873 --> 01:30:47.075
How about you passing
up Florida this spring?

01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:48.944
You know, taking a little
vacation for yourself.

01:30:51.547 --> 01:30:52.948
All right, Lou.

01:30:53.081 --> 01:30:56.485
It's been a long time since you
palled around with the team.

01:30:56.619 --> 01:30:59.087
Give you a little vacation too.

01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:01.056
We have seen a
lot of each other.

01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:03.559
Yeah, it's an idea.

01:31:03.659 --> 01:31:04.493
Yes, it is.

01:31:08.897 --> 01:31:10.165
Ellie.

01:31:10.265 --> 01:31:11.066
Oh, Lou, you don't want
to go without me, do you?

01:31:11.166 --> 01:31:12.267
- No.
- You don't?

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.101
No.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.585
Gotcha.

01:31:29.685 --> 01:31:32.187
Gotcha.

01:31:32.287 --> 01:31:33.288
[whistle]

01:31:34.289 --> 01:31:35.123
The winner.

01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:38.794
Not only that,
you just handed me

01:31:38.927 --> 01:31:40.763
my next story on a
silver platter, how

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:42.330
I beat my wife, by Lou Gehrig.

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:43.431
Nix.

01:31:43.599 --> 01:31:44.432
It's a piparoo.

01:31:44.533 --> 01:31:45.300
Over my dead body.

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:46.134
It'll kill them.

01:31:46.268 --> 01:31:47.936
Lay off our private life.

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:49.605
Then what'll I write above?

01:31:49.705 --> 01:31:51.707
About a half a column.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.677
If I was in the middle of the
Sahara Desert, dying of thirst,

01:31:54.777 --> 01:31:56.178
you'd bring me vinegar.

01:31:56.311 --> 01:31:58.346
I'll see you at the ballpark.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.649
Hey.

01:32:00.783 --> 01:32:02.117
SAM: That's dirty pool.

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:12.861
Lou, why didn't
you want Sam to write

01:32:12.995 --> 01:32:14.162
about your private life?

01:32:14.296 --> 01:32:16.832
Because-- because
that's something that

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:20.135
belongs to just the two of us.

01:32:20.302 --> 01:32:22.571
It's been a pretty good
little ole private life

01:32:22.671 --> 01:32:24.006
at that, hasn't it?

01:32:24.139 --> 01:32:27.576
Even though we
never had a honeymoon?

01:32:27.710 --> 01:32:29.077
We've never had anything else.

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:37.319
[laughing]

01:32:43.058 --> 01:32:44.727
Hey, what's the idea?

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.261
You want a bust in the nose?

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:48.030
Just trying to clean
up some of that poison

01:32:48.163 --> 01:32:49.732
pen stuff of yours, that's all.

01:32:49.832 --> 01:32:50.999
Look at that.

01:32:51.099 --> 01:32:52.601
Gehrig's accidental
home run yesterday.

01:32:52.735 --> 01:32:54.402
I'm only putting down
what Babe Ruth thinks.

01:32:54.536 --> 01:32:56.204
Well, you don't
need paper for that.

01:32:56.338 --> 01:32:58.073
You can write all that Babe ever
thought on a piece of confetti.

01:32:58.206 --> 01:33:01.543
Oh, that was pretty brainy,
I suppose, you having Gehrig

01:33:01.677 --> 01:33:03.378
call Ruth the Ex-King of Swat?

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:04.079
That's facts.

01:33:04.212 --> 01:33:05.714
Gehrig's writing facts.

01:33:05.848 --> 01:33:07.850
Ruth will show you some
facts in this column tomorrow.

01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:10.953
Well, any facts Ruth dreams
up will be topped by Lou Gehrig

01:33:11.053 --> 01:33:12.721
without borrowing
your opium pipe.

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.934
[doorbell]

01:33:26.068 --> 01:33:27.135
Come in.

01:33:30.205 --> 01:33:31.907
These just came, Mrs. Gehrig.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.108
Thank you.

01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:48.576
Hm, just like the kind
Mom used to try to make.

01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:51.914
It's Mom's recipe, as
if you didn't know it.

01:35:52.047 --> 01:35:53.248
[doorbell]

01:35:53.381 --> 01:35:54.549
- Anybody at home?
- Hello.

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:55.183
Pop.

01:35:55.283 --> 01:35:57.786
Hello, Ellie.

01:35:57.886 --> 01:35:58.954
Hello, Lou.
- Mom.

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:00.022
See that breakfast?

01:36:00.122 --> 01:36:01.423
Yes.

01:36:01.523 --> 01:36:02.690
Lou's been raving about
your flapjack recipe, Mom.

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:04.526
Well, don't let him
eat too many, Ellie.

01:36:04.626 --> 01:36:05.794
He'll get fat.

01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:06.728
What if I do?

01:36:06.862 --> 01:36:08.030
Then I can quit baseball.

01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:08.864
What?

01:36:08.964 --> 01:36:10.265
Quit baseball?

01:36:10.365 --> 01:36:12.367
Louie, are you crazy?

01:36:12.534 --> 01:36:14.302
I've always had a hankering
to go in for engineering,

01:36:14.402 --> 01:36:15.603
you know that, Mom.

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:17.139
Engineering.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:19.241
The best ballplayer
in the world should

01:36:19.374 --> 01:36:21.076
waste his time like that.

01:36:21.209 --> 01:36:23.278
Lou always told
me his Uncle Otto--

01:36:23.378 --> 01:36:25.647
Uncle Otto, schmotto.

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:26.714
Digging ditches.

01:36:26.815 --> 01:36:28.783
That's all he ever did.

01:36:28.884 --> 01:36:30.618
The world is full of Otto's.

01:36:30.752 --> 01:36:33.588
But how many Lou
Gehrig's are there?

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:34.890
Look at him.

01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:38.626
Eating flapjacks on the most
important day of his life.

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:39.828
Important?

01:36:39.962 --> 01:36:43.265
Don't tell me you have
forgotten what day this is?

01:36:43.398 --> 01:36:44.466
My birthday?

01:36:44.566 --> 01:36:46.334
No.

01:36:46.468 --> 01:36:49.137
Ellie, I haven't forgotten?

01:36:49.271 --> 01:36:51.339
No, it's not my
birthday either.

01:36:51.473 --> 01:36:55.143
Or Mom's or Pop's, and it's
not our wedding anniversary.

01:36:55.277 --> 01:36:56.845
I'm surprised at you, Ellie.

01:36:56.979 --> 01:37:00.315
Today's the day Lou Gehrig
is playing his 2,000

01:37:00.415 --> 01:37:02.017
consecutive baseball game.

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:03.751
So what?

01:37:03.852 --> 01:37:06.521
What?

01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:10.792
Look at him pretending
he don't care.

01:37:10.926 --> 01:37:12.260
I've got an idea.

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.096
What do you say you
miss today's game?

01:37:14.196 --> 01:37:15.864
They've gone crazy maybe.

01:37:15.998 --> 01:37:16.764
No.

01:37:16.865 --> 01:37:17.799
Don't you see.

01:37:17.933 --> 01:37:19.267
It's no news when
Lou's in the lineup.

01:37:19.334 --> 01:37:21.269
The real news is if
he misses a game.

01:37:21.369 --> 01:37:22.270
Man bites dog, huh?

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:23.305
That's right.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:28.176
Stop joking.

01:37:28.276 --> 01:37:30.312
And come on, get
a wiggle on, you.

01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:33.015
The ballpark will be
crowded, and the fans

01:37:33.148 --> 01:37:34.316
will give you an automobile.

01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:35.450
Why an automobile.

01:37:35.617 --> 01:37:36.618
Maybe they will
give him a yacht.

01:37:36.684 --> 01:37:37.785
Sure.

01:37:37.886 --> 01:37:39.221
An automobile or a yacht
or the Statue of Liberty.

01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:40.722
I'd better go, Ellie.

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.524
Well, all right, if that's
the way you feel about it,

01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:45.827
but I warn you, all you'll
get is a horseshoe of roses.

01:37:45.961 --> 01:37:47.062
Don't be so cynical, Ellie.

01:37:47.195 --> 01:37:48.530
Good luck, Lou
Gehrig, on a ribbon.

01:37:48.663 --> 01:37:50.832
You don't appreciate
Lou's importance, Ellie.

01:37:50.966 --> 01:37:53.068
They'll give him an
automobile at least.

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:54.502
I say a yacht.

01:37:54.636 --> 01:37:55.837
So you don't
appreciate my importance.

01:37:55.971 --> 01:37:57.472
I'm going to get an
automobile or a yacht.

01:37:57.572 --> 01:37:59.241
All right, all
right, if you insist.

01:37:59.374 --> 01:38:02.877
But you'll come home with
a horseshoe of roses.

01:38:14.656 --> 01:38:15.357
Safe.

01:38:34.209 --> 01:38:35.443
Why don't he bunt?

01:38:35.577 --> 01:38:36.911
What's the matter with him?

01:38:37.012 --> 01:38:38.180
Bunt?

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.948
Three runs behind
and you want to bunt.

01:38:40.048 --> 01:38:41.950
The unexpected, Mom.

01:38:42.084 --> 01:38:43.085
Get onto yourself.

01:38:43.218 --> 01:38:45.220
He should wait him out.

01:38:45.353 --> 01:38:48.290
The pitcher has been missing the
corner since the sixth inning.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:49.724
Is that so?

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.960
Why don't you tell McCarthy
how to run his job.

01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:53.895
Shut up, Mom.

01:38:54.029 --> 01:38:55.430
McCarthy is going great today.

01:38:55.563 --> 01:38:58.200
He has pulled three
boners I know of.

01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:01.136
And how would you like
to shut up yourself?

01:39:01.236 --> 01:39:02.904
Say, why don't
you both shut up?

01:39:23.058 --> 01:39:23.758
What?

01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:25.393
No automobile?

01:39:27.996 --> 01:39:28.730
No yacht?

01:39:37.605 --> 01:39:39.174
I was lucky to get
away with my life.

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:40.475
Struck out three times.

01:39:40.608 --> 01:39:42.477
Last time in the ninth
with the bases full.

01:40:05.433 --> 01:40:10.605
If I had my way, darling, I'd
give you the Yankee Stadium.

01:40:10.672 --> 01:40:13.007
Well, I wanted to knock
a home run for ya today.

01:40:13.141 --> 01:40:14.976
Maybe I tried too hard.

01:40:23.651 --> 01:40:26.821
Good luck, Lou Gehrig.

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.223
Good luck.

01:40:28.323 --> 01:40:30.658
If they only knew what I know.

01:40:30.792 --> 01:40:33.728
If they only realized what
lies back of those 2,000 games

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:35.863
you've played.

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:37.899
This is for the time in
Chicago you got beaned

01:40:38.032 --> 01:40:39.033
and went on playing.

01:40:39.167 --> 01:40:40.835
This for having brown eyes.

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:42.070
Hey.

01:40:42.170 --> 01:40:44.172
That's for when you played
12 innings in St. Louis

01:40:44.306 --> 01:40:45.640
with a broken toe.

01:40:45.707 --> 01:40:48.310
Here's for being the
greatest fan a man ever had.

01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:50.478
That's for when
you had 103 fever

01:40:50.578 --> 01:40:51.813
and played a double-header.

01:40:51.913 --> 01:40:54.182
This is for sitting up
all night and curing me.

01:40:54.316 --> 01:40:56.418
This is for when yo had
the flu and wouldn't quit.

01:40:56.518 --> 01:40:58.553
That's for not
letting me quit.

01:40:58.686 --> 01:41:02.357
This is for all the times
you've had broken fingers

01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:03.691
and not told me about them.

01:41:03.825 --> 01:41:05.660
Here's for putting up
with me all these years.

01:41:33.521 --> 01:41:35.390
I won.

01:41:35.523 --> 01:41:36.558
Fair and square, I won.

01:41:36.691 --> 01:41:39.026
Don't try to pretend--

01:41:39.194 --> 01:41:40.027
what is it, Lou?

01:41:44.732 --> 01:41:49.371
I must have sprained
my shoulder or something.

01:41:49.471 --> 01:41:50.738
It felt kind of
stiff at the game.

01:41:50.872 --> 01:41:54.542
Maybe that's why I struck out?

01:41:54.642 --> 01:41:55.710
I'll get the liniment.

01:42:34.749 --> 01:42:36.251
That's the one there.

01:42:41.456 --> 01:42:42.290
Here we go.

01:42:42.424 --> 01:42:43.358
Come on, the old hustle.

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:44.592
Come on, babe.

01:42:49.364 --> 01:42:50.832
That's the one.

01:42:57.339 --> 01:43:00.808
Those kids don't know
what to do with their speed.

01:43:00.942 --> 01:43:02.377
Lucky you got out
of the way so quick.

01:43:02.477 --> 01:43:03.177
Yeah.

01:43:15.623 --> 01:43:17.992
Bill, what's the
matter with Lou?

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:26.234
You're out.

01:43:30.305 --> 01:43:33.007
I certainly came down
here like an old ice wagon.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.376
That should have
been a hit easy.

01:43:34.476 --> 01:43:36.010
Ah, they can't all be hits.

01:43:36.143 --> 01:43:38.513
I tell ya, Lou, maybe
you're trying too hard.

01:43:38.646 --> 01:43:40.081
You can't try too hard.

01:43:40.214 --> 01:43:41.816
Why don't you hit the shower
and take the rest of the day

01:43:41.916 --> 01:43:43.017
off?

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:43.718
No.

01:43:43.818 --> 01:43:45.219
I need a lot of work.

01:44:07.909 --> 01:44:09.411
Well, the old man made it.

01:44:09.511 --> 01:44:11.746
Six times around.

01:44:11.879 --> 01:44:13.180
It's worse than
being a golf widow,

01:44:13.281 --> 01:44:15.583
waiting for your husband
to run around a ballpark.

01:44:15.683 --> 01:44:17.352
I'm sorry to be so long.

01:44:17.452 --> 01:44:19.020
So, I'm slowing up, huh?

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.121
Oh, sure.

01:44:20.221 --> 01:44:22.357
I'll get a wheelchair
and push you around.

01:44:27.362 --> 01:44:28.262
What an exhibition.

01:44:28.396 --> 01:44:29.464
You call that baseball?

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:30.598
Gehrig booted the game.

01:44:30.732 --> 01:44:31.933
Threw it right down the drain.

01:44:32.066 --> 01:44:33.535
Yeah, that's a batting
champion for you.

01:44:33.635 --> 01:44:35.470
Did you see him swing
like an old lady?

01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:37.038
It's criminal.

01:44:37.138 --> 01:44:38.373
They ought to give you your
money back on a game like that.

01:44:49.551 --> 01:44:51.719
That game was
just booted away.

01:44:51.886 --> 01:44:54.055
I got better support than
that in the bush league.

01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:55.156
Ah, shut up.

01:44:55.256 --> 01:44:57.592
Well, I can't pitch
and play first base too.

01:44:57.725 --> 01:44:59.226
That old man on first
outta have some crutches

01:44:59.394 --> 01:45:00.395
to get around with.

01:45:13.274 --> 01:45:14.275
What goes on here?

01:45:15.977 --> 01:45:17.845
Just talked out of turn.

01:45:21.749 --> 01:45:23.317
Save the fight
for the field, boys.

01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:58.112
You watch, Gehrig
will come back.

01:46:58.245 --> 01:46:59.013
He always does.

01:46:59.113 --> 01:47:00.347
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Every ballplayer

01:47:00.448 --> 01:47:02.416
has a slump eventually,
but in Gehrig's case,

01:47:02.517 --> 01:47:03.451
it isn't just a slump.

01:47:03.585 --> 01:47:05.520
It's obviously a breakdown.

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:06.353
That's a lie.

01:47:06.454 --> 01:47:07.789
Yeah, a dirty lie.

01:47:07.922 --> 01:47:10.758
No, sir, he ain't through.

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:12.927
I tell you Mr. Gehrig
can't be through.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:13.961
Gehrig will come back.

01:47:14.095 --> 01:47:15.597
He's made of iron.

01:47:15.697 --> 01:47:16.898
You wait and see.

01:47:17.031 --> 01:47:19.467
15 years, and all of
a sudden, he goes sour.

01:47:19.601 --> 01:47:21.102
What's the answer?

01:47:21.202 --> 01:47:23.137
Gehrig must be having
trouble with his teeth.

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.971
Ow.

01:48:21.462 --> 01:48:22.163
Get back.

01:48:22.296 --> 01:48:22.997
Get back.

01:48:32.674 --> 01:48:33.541
Strike two.

01:48:42.684 --> 01:48:43.551
Strike three.

01:49:07.474 --> 01:49:11.545
Joe, you better send
someone in for me.

01:49:11.679 --> 01:49:16.651
I-- I can't make it anymore.

01:49:16.751 --> 01:49:18.853
You sure you want it that way?

01:49:18.986 --> 01:49:19.687
Yeah.

01:49:23.991 --> 01:49:26.661
Dahlgren, get
in there at first.

01:49:32.834 --> 01:49:33.567
Good luck.

01:49:33.701 --> 01:49:34.401
Thanks, Lou.

01:49:52.687 --> 01:49:55.623
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Your
attention, please.

01:49:55.757 --> 01:50:05.599
Dahlgren now playing first base
for New York, replacing Gehrig.

01:50:12.073 --> 01:50:15.710
2,130 games.

01:50:15.810 --> 01:50:16.543
14 years.

01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:29.623
Play ball.

01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:54.315
It's a routine,
I'm telling ya.

01:50:54.415 --> 01:50:56.117
Why, in a place like
this, they give you

01:50:56.250 --> 01:50:58.786
the x-ray, the cardiograph,
the metabolism,

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:02.123
the fluoroscope, the works.

01:51:02.256 --> 01:51:05.092
Then they're liable to
tell you you got dandruff.

01:51:05.192 --> 01:51:06.260
It's happened time and again.

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:07.361
I had a friend
come up here once--

01:51:07.461 --> 01:51:08.796
Got any chewing gum, Sam?

01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:09.630
Yeah.

01:51:13.768 --> 01:51:16.470
I had a talk with the
doctor the other day.

01:51:16.603 --> 01:51:19.273
He said he never ran up against
a better physical specimen.

01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:22.343
Strong as an ox,
he said you were.

01:51:22.476 --> 01:51:24.812
I talked with that
x-ray guy too, boy.

01:51:24.946 --> 01:51:26.948
What a send off he gave ya.

01:51:27.014 --> 01:51:27.849
Heart, OK.

01:51:27.982 --> 01:51:28.783
Lungs, OK.

01:51:28.883 --> 01:51:30.718
Everything, OK.

01:51:30.818 --> 01:51:32.686
Lou, I'll bet you t--

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:33.687
here's the doctor.

01:51:39.126 --> 01:51:40.527
How did I do, Doctor?

01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:43.330
I'm afraid you'll have to
give up baseball for a while.

01:51:43.464 --> 01:51:45.066
You see, Mr. Gehrig--

01:51:45.166 --> 01:51:48.135
Go ahead, Doc.

01:51:48.235 --> 01:51:50.805
I'm a man who likes to
know his batting average.

01:51:50.905 --> 01:51:54.208
I've only made a superficial
examination of the tests.

01:51:54.308 --> 01:51:55.843
We shall need some new x-rays.

01:52:01.048 --> 01:52:02.716
Give it to me straight, Doc.

01:52:02.850 --> 01:52:04.085
Am I through with baseball?

01:52:04.218 --> 01:52:05.552
I'm afraid so.

01:52:08.856 --> 01:52:11.392
Any worse than that?

01:52:11.525 --> 01:52:13.027
You heard what
the doc said, Lou.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:17.264
He's got to go over
the tests again.

01:52:17.398 --> 01:52:20.067
Is it three strikes, Doc?

01:52:20.201 --> 01:52:21.869
DOCTOR: You want it straight?

01:52:22.003 --> 01:52:22.703
Sure I'd do.

01:52:22.837 --> 01:52:23.871
Straight.

01:52:24.005 --> 01:52:25.372
It's three strikes.

01:52:28.509 --> 01:52:33.214
Doc, if I've
learned one thing,

01:52:33.347 --> 01:52:35.449
all of the arguing in
the world can't change

01:52:35.549 --> 01:52:40.021
the decision of the umpire.

01:52:40.121 --> 01:52:43.590
How much time have I got?

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:44.691
[buzzer]

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:48.529
Pardon me.

01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:49.596
Yes?

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:52.867
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Mrs. Gehrig is waiting.

01:52:53.034 --> 01:52:57.271
DOCTOR: Have her
come up, please.

01:52:57.371 --> 01:53:00.875
Doc, I don't want Mrs.
Gehrig to know ever.

01:53:01.042 --> 01:53:04.245
I understand, but
the newspapers--

01:53:04.378 --> 01:53:05.712
Sam here can
take care of that.

01:53:05.813 --> 01:53:06.981
Can't you, Sam?
- Sure.

01:53:07.114 --> 01:53:07.882
Sure, I will.

01:53:07.982 --> 01:53:08.983
Leave it to me.

01:53:09.116 --> 01:53:11.919
I'll cook up something to--

01:53:12.053 --> 01:53:12.887
Hi, Ellie.

01:53:16.257 --> 01:53:18.559
Well, darling, the verdict's in.

01:53:18.659 --> 01:53:21.062
I'm not such a bad ballplayer,
I really got something.

01:53:21.162 --> 01:53:23.664
Haven't I, Doc?

01:53:23.764 --> 01:53:25.066
What is it?

01:53:25.166 --> 01:53:29.136
Well, I'd be cured by the time
I could learn to pronounce it.

01:53:29.236 --> 01:53:30.637
Can you pronounce it, Doctor?

01:53:30.771 --> 01:53:33.841
We really haven't concluded
all our tests, Mrs. Gehrig.

01:53:33.975 --> 01:53:34.675
[buzzer]

01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:35.642
Excuse me.

01:53:40.814 --> 01:53:41.815
Yes?

01:53:41.949 --> 01:53:42.984
WOMAN ON INTERCOM: X-ray
room is ready, Doctor.

01:53:43.117 --> 01:53:44.151
DOCTOR: Thank you.

01:53:44.285 --> 01:53:46.087
Just one more
picture, Mr. Gehrig.

01:53:46.187 --> 01:53:48.355
Just one more for
the record, eh, Doc?

01:53:48.455 --> 01:53:49.490
Right back, Ellie.

01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:58.032
Ellie, you'll never get all
the pictures they've taken

01:53:58.132 --> 01:53:59.333
of Lou into that scrapbook.

01:53:59.466 --> 01:54:01.435
Why, you'd think he
was a glamour boy.

01:54:01.535 --> 01:54:03.504
What did the doctor tell Lou?

01:54:03.604 --> 01:54:04.105
Nothing.

01:54:04.271 --> 01:54:05.672
Nothing at all.

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:08.109
Some little thing with a long
name, some kind of an itis.

01:54:08.275 --> 01:54:09.610
I don't know.

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:11.845
He'll have to lay
off for a while.

01:54:11.979 --> 01:54:13.214
So what?

01:54:13.347 --> 01:54:15.216
He'll be back next season
or the season after.

01:54:15.349 --> 01:54:18.185
Tell me the truth, Sam.

01:54:18.319 --> 01:54:19.486
I am telling the truth, Ellie.
Honest.

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:21.488
I swear it.
I'd swear on a stack of bibles.

01:54:21.622 --> 01:54:23.624
You heard what the doctor said.

01:54:29.997 --> 01:54:31.832
When is Lou going to die?

01:54:38.239 --> 01:54:39.406
Who told you?

01:54:39.506 --> 01:54:42.009
Nobody had to tell me.

01:54:42.143 --> 01:54:44.811
I could read it in your eyes.

01:54:44.878 --> 01:54:46.347
All of you.

01:54:49.583 --> 01:54:52.053
Oh, it's all right, Sam.

01:54:52.153 --> 01:54:54.989
I'll never let him know I know.

01:54:57.858 --> 01:55:01.428
He's so young yet,
so strong and--

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:30.591
[whistling]

01:56:30.984 --> 01:56:37.924
Ladies and gentlemen,
lemonade, peanuts,

01:56:38.025 --> 01:56:41.095
and popcorn, giving
away free today in honor

01:56:41.195 --> 01:56:42.496
of the great Lou Gehrig.

01:56:48.035 --> 01:56:49.002
Bulletin.

01:56:49.103 --> 01:56:51.538
Gehrig Day, not a
farewell, but a come on.

01:56:51.672 --> 01:56:54.708
A ballyhoo to get more money out
of the Yanks when Gehrig comes

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:56.377
back to the game next season.

01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:03.517
You know what?

01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:05.286
We're going to knock them
dead when we come back, huh?

01:57:05.386 --> 01:57:08.722
Say, do you think we can get
$50,000 out of those tightwads?

01:57:08.822 --> 01:57:10.657
Not a cent under $100,000.

01:57:10.791 --> 01:57:12.659
Stands to reason,
you'll be twice as

01:57:12.793 --> 01:57:15.229
good after you've had a rest.

01:57:15.362 --> 01:57:18.465
You know, we've never
had a honeymoon.

01:57:18.565 --> 01:57:20.801
Why shouldn't we have one now?

01:57:20.901 --> 01:57:22.669
Sure, better late than never.

01:57:22.803 --> 01:57:25.172
Hey, what about
Niagara Falls, huh?

01:57:25.306 --> 01:57:26.640
Sure.

01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.142
And we could go up to northern
Canada and go fishing.

01:57:28.242 --> 01:57:29.243
You know what?

01:57:29.376 --> 01:57:30.311
I've been thinking
maybe we could

01:57:30.411 --> 01:57:31.145
take a trip around the world.

01:57:31.245 --> 01:57:32.513
Uh-huh.

01:57:32.646 --> 01:57:33.980
All the things we've
never had time for before.

01:57:34.047 --> 01:57:36.683
We have all the time in
the world now, haven't we?

01:57:36.817 --> 01:57:40.087
Yeah, we got all the
time in the world now.

01:57:40.187 --> 01:57:42.523
Hey, hey, you're a
scream in that moustache.

01:57:45.392 --> 01:57:47.894
What's that?

01:57:47.994 --> 01:57:48.662
Oh.

01:57:48.762 --> 01:57:52.233
Take it out and see.

01:57:52.333 --> 01:57:53.200
Open it.

01:58:02.676 --> 01:58:06.913
I had that made up of some
of the hardware I collected.

01:58:07.047 --> 01:58:07.914
Like it, Ellie?

01:58:12.386 --> 01:58:14.221
Oh, Lou, I adore it.

01:58:18.125 --> 01:58:22.129
I remember when you got
every one of these medals.

01:58:22.263 --> 01:58:24.030
Yeah, that's the one I
get the most kick out of.

01:58:24.131 --> 01:58:26.767
The batting championship I
won the year we were married.

01:58:30.471 --> 01:58:31.805
Here, here, Ellie.

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:34.575
Oh, I've got a
right to cry a little.

01:58:34.708 --> 01:58:36.710
It's such a beautiful thing.

01:58:40.147 --> 01:58:44.385
I wanted you to have
it, Ellie, because--

01:58:44.485 --> 01:58:45.952
because you've given me so much.

01:58:49.723 --> 01:58:51.158
You've been so--

01:58:54.728 --> 01:58:56.763
Are you making love
to me, you big ape?

01:58:56.897 --> 01:58:58.999
You bet I am, you dope.

01:59:07.274 --> 01:59:08.275
Gehrig Day program.

01:59:21.355 --> 01:59:22.122
Lou Gehrig.

01:59:25.959 --> 01:59:27.861
Oh, look, Russ, Lou Gehrig.

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:29.496
Right this way, Mr. Gehrig.

01:59:29.630 --> 01:59:30.497
Stand back, boys.
Give them room.

01:59:30.631 --> 01:59:31.632
Give them room.

01:59:34.468 --> 01:59:36.470
Mr. Gehrig?

01:59:36.603 --> 01:59:37.771
Oh, Mr. Gehrig, please?

01:59:42.943 --> 01:59:44.044
Don't you remember me?

01:59:46.947 --> 01:59:49.816
You knocked out two home
runs for me one afternoon.

01:59:53.554 --> 01:59:56.189
Oh, sure, sure,
I remember you.

01:59:56.290 --> 01:59:57.157
How are ya?

01:59:57.291 --> 01:59:59.626
Just great.

01:59:59.726 --> 02:00:02.329
I've been waiting here
all afternoon because I

02:00:02.463 --> 02:00:04.064
had to tell you something.

02:00:04.164 --> 02:00:08.569
I just got in town today,
and I have to tell ya.

02:00:08.702 --> 02:00:11.204
I did what you said.

02:00:11.338 --> 02:00:14.007
I tried hard, and I made it.

02:00:17.478 --> 02:00:19.313
Look, I can walk.

02:00:24.685 --> 02:00:29.423
Well, gee, that's
great work, kid.

02:00:29.556 --> 02:00:30.724
That's wonderful.

02:00:34.828 --> 02:00:36.062
Have you got a
ticket for the game?

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:36.897
Yes, sir.

02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:39.232
You bet.

02:00:39.366 --> 02:00:42.035
Well, so long.

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:43.003
So long.

02:00:53.514 --> 02:00:56.883
62,000 people have jammed the
Yankee Stadium this afternoon

02:00:57.017 --> 02:00:59.720
to pay a tribute to a
man who for 16 years

02:00:59.853 --> 02:01:01.688
have given everything
that's in him.

02:01:01.788 --> 02:01:03.056
Never in the history
of baseball has there

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:05.526
been such a spontaneous
demonstration of love

02:01:05.592 --> 02:01:06.893
and affection for one man.

02:01:07.027 --> 02:01:09.062
Perhaps you know him as
Larruping Lou and the Iron

02:01:09.195 --> 02:01:10.764
Horse, but no matter
how you know him,

02:01:10.864 --> 02:01:13.033
he'll never be forgotten,
nor will his great records.

02:01:13.133 --> 02:01:14.535
They'll never forget
his greatest record

02:01:14.635 --> 02:01:16.036
of all, his amazing
feat of playing

02:01:16.136 --> 02:01:19.873
2,130 consecutive ballgames
over a period of 16 years.

02:01:19.973 --> 02:01:22.543
Now, everyone is here today
to show Lou Gehrig just

02:01:22.643 --> 02:01:23.810
what they feel in their hearts.

02:01:23.944 --> 02:01:26.880
To say hail and farewell
to the pride in the

02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:27.748
Yankees.

02:02:24.104 --> 02:02:27.441
The emotion on all sides is
tremendous around home plate.

02:02:27.608 --> 02:02:28.675
All the celebrities
standing there.

02:02:28.775 --> 02:02:29.843
Now, the beginning
of the ceremonies.

02:02:29.976 --> 02:02:31.645
Manager Joe McCarthy
comes forward.

02:02:31.778 --> 02:02:34.815
Hands Lou Gehrig a plaque, and
on that plaque are two words,

02:02:34.948 --> 02:02:36.216
don't quit.

02:02:36.316 --> 02:02:38.819
Nothing in Gehrig's nature
were the quitter type.

02:02:38.952 --> 02:02:40.153
As Joe McCarthy puts
the plaque down,

02:02:40.286 --> 02:02:42.055
turns around, receives
a trophy, and in turn,

02:02:42.155 --> 02:02:43.957
gets that trophy to Lou Gehrig.

02:02:44.057 --> 02:02:46.493
The trophy is a trophy
from the New York Yankees,

02:02:46.627 --> 02:02:47.694
the teammates of Gehrig.

02:02:47.794 --> 02:02:49.229
They're trying to
tell Lou-- here

02:02:49.362 --> 02:02:51.865
comes the mayor of New York
City, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.

02:02:51.998 --> 02:02:54.568
LaGuardia addresses a few
words, perhaps telling him what

02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:55.969
Gehrig has meant to this city.

02:02:56.069 --> 02:02:58.405
Now LaGuardia turns
around, extends his hand,

02:02:58.505 --> 02:02:59.873
and shakes hands
with Lou Gehrig.

02:03:00.006 --> 02:03:02.809
Gehrig visibly impressed
with all this demonstration

02:03:02.909 --> 02:03:04.244
of affection.

02:03:04.377 --> 02:03:06.379
Postmaster General of the
United States, Tim Farley.

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:07.881
Farley walks over and
shakes Gehrig's hand.

02:03:08.014 --> 02:03:10.083
Gehrig, again, trying
to manage a smile.

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:12.018
Now, Babe Ruth,
the Sultan of Swat.

02:03:12.152 --> 02:03:13.987
Babe talks into the microphone.

02:03:14.087 --> 02:03:15.556
Praise from the man
who preceded Lou

02:03:15.656 --> 02:03:17.323
Gehrig in the batting order.
Number three and number four.

02:03:17.491 --> 02:03:20.326
Babe Ruth walks over, puts his
arms around Gehrig's shoulders.

02:03:20.393 --> 02:03:22.429
Here they are, the
heart of the Murderer's

02:03:22.563 --> 02:03:23.764
Row of the New York Yankees.

02:03:23.897 --> 02:03:24.898
Gehrig still with his
eyes down on the ground.

02:03:25.031 --> 02:03:26.332
Now, manager Joe
McCarthy addresses

02:03:26.433 --> 02:03:28.869
some remarks, which draw
him applause from the boys

02:03:29.002 --> 02:03:30.437
themselves.

02:03:30.537 --> 02:03:32.205
McCarthy walks over to Gehrig,
puts his hand affectionately

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:34.708
on his shoulder, and starts
leading Lou Gehrig over towards

02:03:34.841 --> 02:03:36.009
a whole galaxy of microphones.

02:03:36.076 --> 02:03:38.378
Lou Gehrig will be
saying a few words.

02:03:38.512 --> 02:03:40.380
This whole crowd in
the stadium hopes so.

02:03:40.514 --> 02:03:43.183
Gehrig stands in front of the
microphones visibly impressed,

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:43.917
all choked up.

02:03:44.050 --> 02:03:45.552
Listen to that crowd.

02:04:22.388 --> 02:04:28.629
I have been walking on
ball fields for 16 years,

02:04:28.762 --> 02:04:30.764
and I have never
received anything

02:04:30.897 --> 02:04:36.302
but kindness and
encouragement from you fans.

02:04:41.808 --> 02:04:46.847
I have had the great
honor to have played

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.650
with these great
veteran ballplayers

02:04:49.783 --> 02:05:03.964
on my left, Murderer's Row,
our championship team of 1927.

02:05:04.097 --> 02:05:09.836
I have had the further honor
of living with and playing

02:05:09.936 --> 02:05:15.609
with these men on my
right, the Bronx Bombers,

02:05:15.776 --> 02:05:17.210
the Yankees of today.

02:05:19.846 --> 02:05:27.353
I have been given fame and
undeserved praise by the boys

02:05:27.487 --> 02:05:29.522
up there behind the
wire in the press box.

02:05:37.497 --> 02:05:39.232
I have worked under
the two greatest

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:45.471
managers of all time, Miller
Huggins and Joe McCarthy.

02:05:50.977 --> 02:05:57.984
I have a mother and
father who fought

02:05:58.084 --> 02:06:05.091
to give me health and a
solid background in my youth.

02:06:08.995 --> 02:06:16.202
I have a wife, a
companion for life,

02:06:16.336 --> 02:06:20.373
who has shown me more
courage than I ever knew.

02:06:24.244 --> 02:06:29.415
People all say that I
have had a bad break.

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:40.060
But today, today, I consider
myself the luckiest man

02:06:40.193 --> 02:06:42.095
on the face of the earth.

02:06:49.636 --> 02:06:51.371
[applause]

02:07:30.476 --> 02:07:34.114
[music playing]
