WEBVTT

00:03.628 --> 00:06.700
<i>On slow days like this,
we all find ways to pass the time.</i>

00:06.965 --> 00:08.523
<i>Dr Cox tortured the interns...</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:10.070
All right now, children,

00:10.260 --> 00:13.491
I know your shifts are over and
you're all excited about going home,

00:13.763 --> 00:15.276
but first we're going to play
a little game

00:15.473 --> 00:19.227
called "Answer the Question Correctly
or Stay Here Forever. "

00:19.602 --> 00:23.561
Debbie, what are the neoplastic
causes of hyperprolactinemia?

00:24.399 --> 00:27.914
Uh, ectopic tumour production
secondary to renal carcinoma?

00:28.319 --> 00:30.435
Close, but no ciggie.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.257
You'll be staying here forever.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.129
Did you think that was
a little too mean?

00:35.326 --> 00:37.886
- No?
- Wrong. It damn sure was.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.554
You're staying here forever.

00:39.748 --> 00:43.058
And Kenyan Intern,
can you answer me this?

00:43.335 --> 00:46.691
Is it even possible
to give the right answer in this game?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.190
- No.
- Correct.

00:50.508 --> 00:51.463
Yes.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.068
Unfortunately,
you're still staying here forever.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.613
My game, my rules. Come.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.763
<i>Elliot and Carla had joined
the common practise</i>

00:59.976 --> 01:02.729
<i>of dividing up the stuff left behind
when a patient dies.</i>

01:02.979 --> 01:03.968
Score...

01:04.147 --> 01:06.263
I am going to have Keith give me these
later in front of people.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.361
Look, I can use this ratty thing to turn
Turk off when I'm not in the mood...

01:09.611 --> 01:10.885
This is good.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.712
Oh, my God.
Mrs Travis, we are so sorry.

01:15.950 --> 01:16.905
We thought that you were dead.

01:17.952 --> 01:20.022
Yours? I'll put it right back.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.846
<i>And the Janitor was killing time
in the way he always does.</i>

01:26.670 --> 01:28.786
Crash cart to bed three, stat!

01:31.549 --> 01:34.143
We got you. He's not really dying.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.946
I made a device
that makes the sound of a flatline.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.489
It also makes that "beep-beep"
sound of a truck backing up.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.443
I use that on people
who are sensitive about their weight.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.085
I'm sure it's a blast.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.860
Okay, I've put on a few,

01:47.065 --> 01:49.943
but my son's new fiance, Kenny,
owns a Cinnabon franchise.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.388
What the hell am I supposed to do?

01:52.612 --> 01:55.410
<i>As for Turk and I, we had just checked
on a patient who had a pig valve</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:58.171
<i>installed in his heart, which sparked
a lively medical debate.</i>

01:58.410 --> 02:00.719
So, if you could have any animal part,
what would it be?

02:00.954 --> 02:03.422
- That's easy.
- Besides an elephant's penis.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.621
Oh, then I need a sec.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.366
Whale's blowhole.

02:08.627 --> 02:10.505
That way when I'm playing submarine
in the bathtub

02:10.714 --> 02:12.306
I would never have to come up for air.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.542
That's cool.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.150
Wanna know
what animal parts I'd want?

02:15.343 --> 02:16.822
<i>I could guess.</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:20.121
Man, there's no milk for my coffee.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.120
Say no more.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.801
Thanks, pal.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.016
Welcome. You know
what would go great with that coffee?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.506
What's that?

02:35.196 --> 02:37.505
- Turkey bacon.
- Yeah.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.737
- You'd be like a big breakfast machine.
- Yeah.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.760
<i>Finally, something happened
that broke the monotony.</i>

02:45.999 --> 02:48.911
This guy from the ER, he tried to kill
himself by jumping off a building.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.763
Let's go, people. Lend a hand.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.279
I'm hiring a trainer, damn it.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074

<i>When a patient regains consciousness
from a head trauma,</i>

03:16.279 --> 03:17.997
<i>the first order of business is simple.</i>

03:18.656 --> 03:20.772
Do you know what your name is?

03:22.077 --> 03:23.749
I don't remember.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.270
Okay, well, usually
in this type of situation,

03:26.498 --> 03:29.490
we'd refer to you as a John Doe,
but I think that's so impersonal.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.140
I'm gonna call you Roger Templeton.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.156
I'm just kidding. Found your wallet.
Your name's really Roger Templeton.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.016
A little memory-loss humour, okay?
No? All right.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.775
I think what you probably have is
a little temporary retrograde amnesia,

03:46.059 --> 03:49.176
very common with this sort of injury.
What you need to do is get some rest.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.249
Amnesia?

03:51.439 --> 03:53.794
What did he say when you told him
he tried to commit suicide?

03:54.025 --> 03:55.140
I didn't tell him.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.990
He doesn't need to deal
with that right now.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.425
Hell, maybe we should never tell him.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.375
<i>I know I'd love to forget all the painful
things that have happened to me,</i>

04:02.617 --> 04:04.209
<i>but unfortunately
I keep replaying them</i>

04:04.411 --> 04:07.005
<i>in my head like some clip show
from a bad sitcom</i>

04:07.247 --> 04:09.203
<i>too lazy to come up with a fresh story.</i>

04:33.857 --> 04:35.131
That's odd.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.151
Hey, J.D.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.082
Yes?

04:57.714 --> 04:58.783
Hold it!

05:19.527 --> 05:20.482
Oh, no.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.889
So, you're saying you'd be just fine
waking up one morning

05:41.132 --> 05:42.850
having forgotten parts of your life?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.643
No, just the bad stuff,

05:44.844 --> 05:47.836
<i>like The Matrix sequels
and that time we went skiing</i>

05:48.098 --> 05:50.771
and I got my lip mole stuck
in the zipper of my puffy coat.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.453
There are so many moments in my life
I will never forget.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.680
Oh, like that time my dad accidentally
glued my mom's legs together

05:57.941 --> 05:59.818
after testing out
his new homemade sex lube.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.218
Your dad's awesome.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.338
<i>There's certainly been
a lot of odd moments around here</i>

06:05.573 --> 06:07.689
<i>and for some reason,
whenever I think about them,</i>

06:07.951 --> 06:09.543
<i>The Fray is always playing.</i>

06:09.744 --> 06:12.781
...puts me over to you. I just thought
it would be a difficult case.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.499
<i>No, not that Fray song.
This Fray song.</i>

06:31.307 --> 06:32.262
Where was I?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.990
This is the reason
why your headache didn't go away.

06:36.229 --> 06:40.347
That's actually pronounced
"ah-nuhl-gesic," not "anal-gesic. "

06:40.650 --> 06:42.845
Sir, the pills go in your mouth.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.451
You know, I actually like Julie, so don't
do that thing that you always do.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.531
If you're referring to the game
"Find the saltine," relax.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.695
I don't even play that
with Turk any more.

06:52.162 --> 06:56.121
- Behind your ear.
- My friend, you have found the saltine.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.014
Don't tell Elliot we're still playing.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.041
- When did you meet Morgan Freeman?
- That's my mom.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.848
Okay, I still want to refer you
to a dermatologist,

07:08.094 --> 07:09.891
but it looks benign to me.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.633
Nine, nine-and-a-half.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.124
You know why?

07:15.310 --> 07:18.939
It's not because I have the name
Johnny tattooed on my butt.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.460
He's an old sailor buddy,
and if you went through what we did,

07:21.691 --> 07:22.919
you'd understand.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.328
- Have you been drinking?
- I'm not drunk.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.448
Why is there a pancake
in the silverware drawer?

07:28.656 --> 07:31.216
You mean, "Why is there silverware
in the pancake drawer?"

07:33.661 --> 07:37.017
Hey, those nuts are for my brother.
Please don't eat them all.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.686
Do you see what you get, Carla?

07:43.046 --> 07:46.561
Do you see what you get
when you mess with the warrior?

07:47.050 --> 07:49.006
<i>Are you watching Sesame Street?</i>

07:49.219 --> 07:53.337
You know, when I was a kid, I had
my first sex dream about Mr Hooper.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.997
At least I think it was a sex dream.
He was trying to choke me.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.940
Either this kid has a light bulb up his
butt, or his colon has a great idea.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.065
You know, you're right. I was an idiot
to buy these Shower Shortz.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.353
I mean, it's not like they come

08:06.528 --> 08:09.042
with a complimentary shower wallet.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.605
Shower Shortz?

08:13.034 --> 08:16.549
For the man who has nothing to hide,
but still wants to.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.996
Did you know they're actually
experimenting with a drug

08:21.209 --> 08:23.723
that can erase stuff from your head,
like memories, dreams...

08:23.962 --> 08:25.634
I don't remember any of my dreams,
anyway,

08:25.839 --> 08:28.512
except for the ones
involving cheese and Tyra Banks.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.644
Baby, don't worry,
you have nothing to be threatened by.

08:32.886 --> 08:37.039
In my book, it goes cheese, you, Tyra.

08:38.934 --> 08:43.133
Well, I know one person who's not
down with erasing dreams, right, J. D?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.562
<i>I was already gone.</i>

08:45.900 --> 08:48.289
Holy inferiority complex, Batman,

08:48.528 --> 08:51.281
how low is my self-esteem that
I'm the sidekick in my own fantasy?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.728
It could be worse, Robin.
You could be Alfred, the butler.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.329
Damn you, sir.

09:11.217 --> 09:15.893
- Kronk, why do you go now?
- Oh, hey, you're up.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.971
I got a ton of bricks for Dr Dorian.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.836
Is it hot in here? It's, like... It's hot.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.138
Yeah, I got something to say
to Dr Cox!

09:53.385 --> 09:58.095
I'm gonna give you the best
damn evaluation that you ever did see!

09:58.431 --> 10:02.140
And this Friday,
at the steel cage medi-slam,

10:02.435 --> 10:06.906
I'm gonna give you a physical
that you ain't never gonna forget!

10:07.315 --> 10:11.103
I'm gonna probe you
'cause I'm the intern!

10:17.992 --> 10:19.391
Answer me!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.185
Show me boobs!

10:22.038 --> 10:23.471
There they are!

10:26.501 --> 10:28.378
Bring it on, bitch.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.977
And as you can see,
the ass is on the front.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.914
You missed a spot.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.090
Whack a Newbie!
Whack, whack! Damn!

10:43.309 --> 10:44.628
Missed me!

10:56.531 --> 10:58.886
I don't like the way I look,
I don't like the way I think,

10:59.117 --> 11:01.028
I don't like the way I feel
about how I look and think.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.608
I have too much hair,

11:02.787 --> 11:05.824
my boobs are too low,
my butt is too big and I'm too short.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.391
Hey, man, how am I supposed to
finish this memo?

11:27.354 --> 11:28.503
J. D!

11:28.855 --> 11:31.050
I'm telling you,
you guys should daydream more often.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.583
All you have to do
is tilt your head to the left

11:33.818 --> 11:37.527
and then let your mind run free,
like an eagle.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.757
<i>As I wondered if I looked that stupid
when I fantasised,</i>

11:40.992 --> 11:42.710
<i>I decided to check on Mr Templeton.</i>

11:42.911 --> 11:45.823
<i>Unfortunately, he was up
and had a question.</i>

11:46.122 --> 11:49.273
<i>- How did I get hurt?
- Damn it.</i>

11:53.957 --> 11:57.233
- So, what'd you do?
- I did what any good doctor would do.

11:57.502 --> 12:00.062
I turned up his morphine drip
so he'd go back to sleep.

12:02.966 --> 12:06.038
Oh, you guys, thank God you're here.
This lady is in very serious condition.

12:08.180 --> 12:11.809
You've all heard
about my flatline device?

12:13.226 --> 12:14.215
Yeah?

12:14.394 --> 12:16.624
Okay, well, forgive me
for trying to liven things up around here

12:16.855 --> 12:19.085
by faking an old stranger's death.

12:19.650 --> 12:21.606
Plan B: Let's dance!

14:29.238 --> 14:31.149
Hey, you,

14:31.448 --> 14:32.483
yes or no?

14:32.658 --> 14:34.171
- What?
- Well, it's a new game.

14:34.368 --> 14:35.687
Yes or no?

14:35.994 --> 14:37.143
- No.
- Wrong.

14:37.329 --> 14:38.603
Now, you have to stay here forever.

14:38.789 --> 14:39.744
Go.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.581
<i>I couldn't help being reminded
of all the mean things</i>

14:43.794 --> 14:45.273
<i>we've done to each other
over the years.</i>

14:45.462 --> 14:47.817
<i>And I realised if I replayed them all
in my head back to back,</i>

14:48.048 --> 14:49.845
<i>I could probably kill
another couple of minutes.</i>

14:51.134 --> 14:55.730
You went to four years of college
and four years of medical school,

14:56.056 --> 14:59.765
so I can safely presume
that you are at least eight.

15:02.813 --> 15:05.611
Newbie, the only way
you could be less productive right now

15:05.857 --> 15:08.610
is if you were, in fact, the wall
on which you're leaning against.

15:08.860 --> 15:10.339
Of course, then you'd be providing

15:10.529 --> 15:13.089
some jackass with a wall
on which to lean against and reflect

15:13.323 --> 15:14.881
on what a jackass he truly is.

15:15.075 --> 15:17.828
Hey, come here a sec.
We wanna do stuff to you.

15:24.126 --> 15:25.354
Don't do that annoying thing.

15:25.544 --> 15:27.136
- What annoying thing?
- You know, when you talk.

15:27.337 --> 15:28.292
- Come on, that...
- See, there it is.

15:28.463 --> 15:30.454
How does that not drive you crazy?

15:30.674 --> 15:33.984
Frankly, each time you call me
a girl's name, I die a little inside.

15:34.261 --> 15:35.250
Hey, girl's name.

15:35.429 --> 15:37.545
Do you know how
I know that this is yours, Farah?

15:37.764 --> 15:38.753
Mary?

15:38.932 --> 15:39.887
My gal Friday.

15:40.058 --> 15:41.491
You know, Sandy isn't necessarily
a girl's name.

15:41.685 --> 15:42.674
It's short for Sandra.

15:42.853 --> 15:44.002
Fiona. Tiny Dancer.

15:44.187 --> 15:45.859
Rhoda... Babs... Vivian. Nancy Drew.

15:46.064 --> 15:47.019
Sabrina. Carol.

15:47.190 --> 15:48.942
Skeech.
How about, "Go to hell, Shakira"?

15:49.151 --> 15:50.266
<i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

15:50.444 --> 15:51.638
<i>Gladys, Ginger, Tiffany. No!</i>

15:51.820 --> 15:53.936
<i>Cheryl, Betsy, Betsy...
That's a new one.</i>

15:54.156 --> 15:56.351
- Betsy, good morning.
- I get it, I'm a girl.

15:56.575 --> 15:58.213
Could you be a bigger ass right now?

15:58.410 --> 16:00.924
Could you have
a bigger ass right now?

16:01.413 --> 16:04.962
I'm assuming since you already
went ahead and took everything else,

16:05.250 --> 16:07.081
that you're here for my self-respect,

16:07.294 --> 16:10.445
but there's bad news on that one,
sweet-cheeks,

16:10.714 --> 16:14.070
I already gave it to your mom
when she begged me to marry you.

16:15.594 --> 16:17.027
Oh, I wouldn't have room for it anyway

16:17.220 --> 16:19.450
what with your testicles
in my trophy case.

16:19.681 --> 16:21.160
- Sir, I'm confused.
- You annoy me.

16:21.350 --> 16:22.339
Oh, now I get it.

16:22.517 --> 16:25.793
Hey, champ, what has two thumbs
and doesn't give a crap?

16:26.438 --> 16:28.588
Bob Kelso. How you doin'?

16:28.815 --> 16:30.965
Janitor, have you ever
looked at yourself

16:31.193 --> 16:34.105
and wished you were different
in every single way?

16:34.738 --> 16:37.616
No. I'm a winner.

16:38.784 --> 16:41.252
Does this shade of red make me
look like a clown?

16:41.495 --> 16:43.326
No, Barbie, no.

16:43.997 --> 16:48.275
It makes you look like a prostitute
who caters exclusively to clowns.

16:52.714 --> 16:53.908
Frick! Frick!

16:54.091 --> 16:55.046
Double frick!

16:58.178 --> 16:59.975
Anybody got
any extra ketchup packets?

17:00.806 --> 17:02.205
Thank you, Elliott.

17:02.933 --> 17:04.605
- You're a jerk.
- You're a jerk.

17:04.810 --> 17:06.323
- Jackass.
- Bite me.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.748
Great guy.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.857
After all, I'm the whiz kid.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.428
You are now.

17:14.444 --> 17:16.877
Anyway, Newbie, the reason
I came down here was to tell you

17:17.114 --> 17:18.866
that Mr Take the Easy Way Out
was awake again

17:19.074 --> 17:21.747
and wants to know
why his lips taste like asphalt.

17:22.743 --> 17:24.700
Somebody's got to go in there
and tell him.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.313
I'll go do it.

17:29.543 --> 17:30.817
<i>We all knew Dr Cox was right</i>

17:31.003 --> 17:33.233
<i>because the truth is
it's all of your memories,</i>

17:33.547 --> 17:35.936
<i>the joyful ones
and the heartbreaking ones,</i>

17:36.174 --> 17:37.892
<i>that make up
who you are as a person.</i>

17:50.564 --> 17:54.159
- You know, I don't care what you think.
- Yeah, you do.

17:54.568 --> 17:55.523
I know.

17:58.989 --> 18:01.139
Look, I wanna be like you,

18:02.784 --> 18:04.615
but a more successful you.

18:05.579 --> 18:09.174
- Are you crying?
- No.

18:09.625 --> 18:12.697
I don't know.
I'm just completely hormonal.

18:12.961 --> 18:16.158
I mean, you try going
from out-of-control horny

18:16.423 --> 18:18.300
to clinically depressed six times a day.

18:18.508 --> 18:21.102
Give me a break,
I can knock that out on the way to work.

18:23.305 --> 18:26.297
Hey, lady,
I'm proud of what you're doing here.

18:27.768 --> 18:30.077
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

18:31.313 --> 18:34.146
Look, man,
it was one second of doubt, okay?

18:35.275 --> 18:36.833
Since when do you care
what anybody else thinks?

18:37.027 --> 18:40.019
I don't. I care what you think.

18:41.281 --> 18:44.034
<i>Then I witnessed one of those
moments that let me know in my heart</i>

18:44.284 --> 18:47.003
<i>that these two
would be together forever.</i>

18:47.579 --> 18:48.807
Who cares?

18:50.916 --> 18:52.747
We're having a baby.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.435
We're having a baby.

18:55.629 --> 18:56.903
Yeah, we are.

18:57.089 --> 18:58.283
- A baby.
- Yeah.

18:58.465 --> 19:01.980
- A little you.
- Yeah and with a lot of you.

19:03.679 --> 19:05.192
There's one more thing
you have to do for me.

19:05.389 --> 19:07.823
You can't keep me from getting drunk.

19:08.517 --> 19:09.791
You have to forgive yourself

19:09.977 --> 19:11.569
for everything
that went down the other day.

19:13.522 --> 19:15.990
- You are so annoying.
- Yeah.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.176
- Okay.
- Good.

19:21.780 --> 19:25.250
Hey, where's your camera?
Aren't you gonna take some pictures?

19:27.119 --> 19:28.234
Pictures of what?

19:28.412 --> 19:31.324
You know, the crying babies
covered in chocolate,

19:31.582 --> 19:33.220
<i>people singing Happy Birthday
to my son</i>

19:33.417 --> 19:36.693
who have never even met him before,
you know, the whole routine.

19:38.505 --> 19:40.461
Where do you think we are?

19:56.231 --> 19:59.189
I guess I came over here to tell you

20:00.736 --> 20:02.772
how proud of you I am.

20:02.988 --> 20:05.786
Not because you did the best you could
for those patients,

20:07.784 --> 20:11.254
but because after 20 years
of being a doctor,

20:12.372 --> 20:15.728
when things go badly,
you still take it this hard.

20:18.462 --> 20:20.214
And I gotta tell you, man, I mean,

20:22.007 --> 20:23.884
that's the kind of doctor I wanna be.

20:34.436 --> 20:37.633
It really has been
an amazing six years, hasn't it?

20:37.898 --> 20:39.854
I wouldn't change
a single moment, would you?

20:40.067 --> 20:41.625
Oh, I'd damn sure change this moment.

20:41.818 --> 20:43.774
In fact, I'd change this moment
and every other moment

20:43.987 --> 20:47.297
you and I have ever had
that's even remotely like this moment.

20:48.492 --> 20:51.370
- Turk, can I ask you a quick favour?
- I am not giving you a hug.

20:52.871 --> 20:54.543
<i>I hate this place.</i>

20:55.305 --> 21:01.173
