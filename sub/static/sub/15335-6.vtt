All: OUT NOW! OUT NOW!
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!

12:18.738 --> 12:21.875
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!

12:21.909 --> 12:25.212
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!

12:25.245 --> 12:27.815
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!

12:27.848 --> 12:30.583
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!
OUT NOW! OUT NOW!

12:30.617 --> 12:33.353
OUT NOW! OUT NOW! OUT!

12:44.031 --> 12:46.099
ALL RIGHT.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.810
WHY AREN'T
THEY BEING SEARCHED?

12:56.844 --> 13:00.480
WE DON'T CARE WHAT
THEY CARRY IN.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.285
WE CARE VERY MUCH
WHAT THEY CARRY OUT.

13:05.318 --> 13:05.986
OH.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.255
CAN'T CARRY
ANYTHING OUT.

13:08.288 --> 13:13.693
I SUPPOSE THEY DO TRY.
DIAMONDS ARE SMALL.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.329
DIAMONDS ARE SMALL.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.032
BUT WE ARE
VERY THOROUGH.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.302
OH, YES, THE RULES
ARE PLAIN

13:22.335 --> 13:25.738
TO THE MEANEST
UNDERSTANDING.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.941
MOVE FORWARD.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.376
ALL METAL IN THE TRAY.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.712
NOW LET US SEE
WHAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.224
YOUR PISTOL
WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU

13:44.257 --> 13:47.560
AT THE COMPLETION
OF YOUR STAY.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.733
YOUR MAN, DOES
HE COME WITH YOU?

13:53.766 --> 13:56.769
HE'S MY ADVISOR.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.207
VERY WELL.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.184
WELL?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.320
RESTORED, STREET-LEGAL,
SHOWROOM FRESH.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.621
ANY MAN-JACK,
THIS MAN'S ARMY,

14:14.654 --> 14:18.191
WOULD FIGHT TO PAY 10
GRAND TO TAKE IT HOME
AND CALL IT "MUFFY."

14:18.225 --> 14:20.860
WELL, ALL HE'D HAVE
TO DO THEN IS RESTORE IT.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.262
THIS MONEY'S
GOING WHERE?

14:22.295 --> 14:25.265
INTO THE KITTY.
OLD HOME WEEK.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.368
PHONE CARDS, FREE
FOR FOLKS IN IRAQ.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.536
HENDERSON!

14:29.569 --> 14:30.703
SAART!

14:30.737 --> 14:32.239
DRAG YOUR IGNORANCE
OVER HERE. YOU'RE
GOING ON A MISSION

14:32.272 --> 14:36.109
LABOR, OF COURSE,
WILL BE COURTESY OF THE
UNITED STATES MILITARY.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.946
OH, MY. OH, MY.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.047
1943.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.049
WELL, NOW, I KNOW
WHAT LOVE IS.

14:42.082 --> 14:45.018
I CAN MISPLACE
THIS FANATIC'S TIMESHEETS.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.221
MATERIALS, HOWEVER,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED...

14:48.255 --> 14:50.423
WHAT WILL THIS COST,
YOUNG SERGEANT?

14:50.457 --> 14:51.724
HARD COSTS?

14:51.758 --> 14:52.892
LISTENING TO YOU.

14:52.926 --> 14:53.793
NEW PAINT.

14:53.826 --> 14:54.427
WE CAN MIX IT.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.463
NO, WE'RE GONNA NEED HERE...

14:56.496 --> 14:59.766
UH...BLOCK'S CRACKED.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.201
UH...OH, MY.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.770
NO. THIS IS GONNA
RUN YOU SOME MONEY.

15:03.803 --> 15:04.837
SARGE, I'M IN LOVE.

15:04.871 --> 15:08.208
I'M GONE TELL YOU WHAT--
YOU COME UP WITH, SAY, UH...

15:08.241 --> 15:09.209
2,500 BUCKS.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.477
2,500 BUCKS?

15:10.510 --> 15:13.413
WHOA, LOOK HERE.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.849
Henderson: OH, MAN.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.218
I KNOW SOME ENTHUSIASTS

15:18.251 --> 15:22.122
GIVE THEIR LEFT ARM
FOR JUST THAT FIRST-AID KIT.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.927
WHOA. HEY, HEY,
CHECK THIS OUT.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.136
MAY I?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.576
"OH, MY DARLING,

15:43.610 --> 15:44.978
"THERE IS A LULL
IN THE SHOOTING,

15:45.012 --> 15:46.613
"AND I AM TAKING
THESE FEW MINUTES

15:46.646 --> 15:48.681
"TO SHARE
THESE THOUGHTS WITH YOU,

15:48.715 --> 15:51.584
"THAT IF IT IS MY TIME,
AND IT MAY BE,

15:51.618 --> 15:56.089
"THAT MY LAST THOUGHT,
IF GOD GRANTS ME THAT MOMENT,

15:56.123 --> 15:58.025
"FOR ONE LAST GOOD-BYE,

15:58.058 --> 16:01.661
"THAT THOUGHT
WILL BE OF YOU,

16:01.694 --> 16:03.496
"MY DARLING MIDGE.

16:03.530 --> 16:07.034
LOVE, JIMMY."

16:09.169 --> 16:12.839
HELLO? THIS IS KIM BROWN.
IS HE THERE?

16:12.872 --> 16:15.675
OLD HOME WEEK.
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETING

16:15.708 --> 16:18.178
AT MY HOUSE.
TONIGHT. 8:00 P.M.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.146
WHAT?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.147
MY HOUSE.
8:00 P.M.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.482
I MIGHT BE A LITTLE LATE.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.983
GEORGE, KIM BROWN.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.519
LISTEN TO THIS,
LISTEN TO THIS.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.355
HAVE I GOT
AN IDEA FOR YOU.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.558
"THAT MY LAST THOUGHT,
IF GOD GRANTS ME THAT MOMENT

16:31.591 --> 16:38.065
FOR ONE LAST GOOD-BYE,
THAT THOUGHT WILL BE
OF YOU, MY DARLING MIDGE."

16:38.098 --> 16:39.999
"MY LAST THOUGHT
WILL BE OF YOU."

16:40.033 --> 16:41.468
BUT HE NEVER
SENT THE LETTER.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.902
NO, HE DID NOT.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.672
WHICH LEADS US TO BELIEVE...

16:45.705 --> 16:46.706
THAT IS CORRECT.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.576
CONGRATULATIONS, AGAIN,
ON THE PROMOTION, GEORGE.

16:49.609 --> 16:54.247
AND YOU WOULD LIKE ME
TO DO WHAT WITH THIS NEW
FOUND POWER OF MINE?

16:54.281 --> 16:55.182
I'LL WRITE THE COPY.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.816
I WANT YOU TO PROMO
OUR OLD HOME WEEK.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.088
THE IDEA IS: PHONE CARDS
FOR OUR TROOPS OVERSEAS.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.922
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE--

17:02.955 --> 17:04.591
LOOK AT THIS LETTER--

17:04.624 --> 17:07.760
IS A VOICE FROM THE PAST
CALLING HOME.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.696
CALLING TO HIS WIFE.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.064
IT'S A GOOD STORY.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.032
A GOOD STORY?

17:13.066 --> 17:15.102
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THIS IS A GREAT STORY.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.004
AND WORTH EVERY PENNY
OF THE $3.000

17:18.037 --> 17:19.606
WE NEED KTML
TO CONTRIBUTE

17:19.639 --> 17:21.608
FOR THE RESTORATION
OF THE JEEP.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.575
$3,000.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.111
THINK OF
THE BANG-FOR-YOUR-BUCK.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.712
IT'S A GOOD STORY.
HERE'S THE THING.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.848
I TURN OVER MY PSA TIME
TO YOU, PROMOTE YOUR EVENT.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.718
ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW,
ONE, MAYBE 2 TWO SPOTS,

17:31.751 --> 17:36.456
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
AND I DONATE THE $3,000
AND THAT GETS IN THE AIR,

17:36.489 --> 17:38.925
I'M BOMBARDED BY EVERY
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP

17:38.958 --> 17:40.393
THAT WANTS
TO SAVE STRAY CATS.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.129
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
STRAY CATS, SIR.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.231
I'M TALKING ABOUT MEN
AND WOMEN IN COMBAT.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.899
NO, NO. INDEED, INDEED.
I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.035
MY POINT IS THAT
IF I DO THIS FOR YOU,

17:49.068 --> 17:53.072
I STEP OVER THE LINE
FROM PUBLIC SERVICE
TO PROMOTION.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.108
YOUR STORY?
IT'S A GOOD STORY

17:55.142 --> 17:57.977
WHAT IF I MAKE IT
A GREAT STORY?

17:58.010 --> 18:03.116
YOU MAKE IT A GREAT STORY,
YOU COME BACK AND SEE ME.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.486
CONFLICT RESOLUTION
TEACHES US THAT

18:06.519 --> 18:09.756
NOTHING MAY BE RESOLVED,
UNLESS AND UNTIL

18:09.789 --> 18:11.958
EACH SIDE RECOGNIZES
THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT

18:11.991 --> 18:15.928
OF THE OTHER SIDE
TO A POINT OF VIEW.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.797
NOW--THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.301
IN INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS,
AS IN CHILDREARING,

18:21.334 --> 18:22.669
2 CHILDREN WILL FIGHT.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.604
WHAT IS THE FIRST THING
ONE MUST DO?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.806
THE FIRST THING.
CHRISTINE.

18:26.839 --> 18:27.940
MAKE THEM
STOP HITTING.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.609
WELL, THAT IS CORRECT.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.645
NOW, WAR--YES.

18:32.679 --> 18:36.849
"NO CONFLICT MAY BE RESOLVED
UNTIL EACH SIDE RECOGNIZES

18:36.883 --> 18:38.418
THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT
OF THE OTHER--"

18:38.451 --> 18:39.152
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.920
TO?
TO THEIR POINT OF VIEW

18:40.953 --> 18:42.455
WHAT ABOUT HITLER?

18:42.489 --> 18:44.324
ANYBODY?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.092
THE VERSAILLES TREATY?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.160
EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.961
HAD THE VERSAILLES
TREATY DEALT FAIRLY

18:48.995 --> 18:51.164
WITH A DEFEATED
GERMANY AT THE END
OF WORLD WAR ONE,

18:51.198 --> 18:56.536
COULD THE GERMAN PUBLIC
EVER HAVE BEEN RECEPTIVE
TO THE NAZI PROGRAM?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.705
NOW...YES?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.773
WHAT ABOUT 9/11?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.175
3,000 PEOPLE DIED.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.944
SHOULD WE HAVE RECOGNIZED
THE TERRORISTS' RIGHT
TO KILL THOSE PEOPLE?

19:04.977 --> 19:07.214
BUT THOSE PEOPLE
HAD A GRIEVANCE.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.782
YES, I KNOW THEY
HAD A GRIEVANCE,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.484
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THEY WERE RIGHT.

19:11.518 --> 19:14.454
SUFFICIENT THAT
THEY WERE WILLING TO
KILL THEIR CHILDREN.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.655
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.790
I DON'T MIND THEM
KILLING THEIR CHILDREN.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.827
I OBJECT TO THEIR
KILLING MY CHILDREN.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.662
SOMEBODY THINKS
I OFFENDED HIM,

19:22.695 --> 19:24.163
I SUPPOSE HE CAN
GIVE ME A CALL.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.132
HE COMES INTO MY HOUSE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

19:26.165 --> 19:29.802
WITH A BUTCHER KNIFE,
I'M GOING TO SHOOT HIM DEAD

19:29.836 --> 19:31.904
BECAUSE I HAVE
A FAMILY TO DEFEND.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.507
IS THIS SO FOREIGN
FROM YOUR WAY OF THINKING?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.908
THE BIBLE SAYS "THOU
SHALT NOT KILL."

19:35.942 --> 19:39.011
YEAH. WELL, I GUESS OUR
OPPONENTS MISSED THAT PART.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.146
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.982
I, UH, I'M
ON THE AMERICAN SIDE.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.517
DIDN'T I SEE YOU
AT THE PEACE PROTEST?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.386
WELL, YEAH. I WAS
DRIVING INTO THE BASE.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.487
YOU WORK AT THE BASE?

19:47.520 --> 19:50.423
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
AND I HAVE SOMETHING
ELSE TO SAY.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.560
"THE COST OF ARROGANCE
IS PAID IN BLOOD."

19:53.593 --> 19:55.194
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:55.228 --> 19:57.664
AND--AND HOW CAN
YOU STAND THERE,

19:57.697 --> 19:58.865
WITH YOUR SUPERIOR WISDOM

19:58.898 --> 20:01.368
AND BERATE THE MEN AND
WOMEN WHO HAVE SWORN

20:01.401 --> 20:04.203
WITH THEIR LIVES
TO DEFEND YOU?

20:04.237 --> 20:05.238
YOU SCREAM AT FIREMEN,

20:05.272 --> 20:06.839
WHEN THEY'RE GOING
TO PUT OUT A FIRE?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.942
DO YOU? WELL,
THERE'S A FIRE, PEOPLE.

20:09.976 --> 20:10.910
YOU'RE AT WAR.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.179
AND THOUGH IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO BELIEVE,

20:13.212 --> 20:14.213
YOU DON'T KNOW IT.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.014
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER,

20:15.047 --> 20:16.182
AND YOU'RE
IN THE WRONG ROOM!

20:16.215 --> 20:18.785
WHAT ABOUT "RECOGNIZING
THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT
OF THE OTHER?"

20:18.818 --> 20:20.853
THIS IS A PEACE MEETING.

20:20.887 --> 20:21.888
OH, GOOD. WELL.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.256
YOU'RE WILLING
TO FIGHT FOR PEACE.
GOOD FOR YOU.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.258
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THE MEN AND THE WOMEN

20:25.292 --> 20:26.626
ON THE BASE ARE DOING.

20:26.659 --> 20:27.460
GOOD FOR YOU!

20:27.494 --> 20:30.430
NOW, I HAVE
A FEW MORE REMARKS.

20:32.999 --> 20:36.469
THE AUCTION, GENERALLY,
IS CONCLUDED BY 4:00

20:36.503 --> 20:37.804
MR. JOHNSON
HAS ARRANGED A BRIEF

20:37.837 --> 20:40.773
BUT INSTRUCTIVE TOUR
OF THE MINING OPERATION
AFTER THE SETTLEMENT.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.642
THE SHEIKH IS PAID
IN DOLLARS?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.411
AH, YES, "THE SHEIKH."

20:44.444 --> 20:45.612
SETTLEMENT
IS MADE IN DOLLARS.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.880
OUR AUCTION HOUSE
WITHHOLDS 10 PERCENT.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.217
IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENT
I MADE AT THE GATE.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.552
YOU SEE THESE MEN?

20:52.585 --> 20:56.889
THESE MEN LABOR IN THE
SUN FOR YEARS TO OBTAIN

20:56.923 --> 20:57.957
BUT A FRACTION
OF THE DIAMONDS

20:57.990 --> 21:00.760
YOUR PEOPLE STOLE
IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR,

21:00.793 --> 21:04.764
WHICH YOU STOLE FROM
ACQUAINTANCES OF MINE.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.900
I REGRET THAT
WE HAVE OFFENDED YOU.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.471
HOW IS SUCH REGRET
TRADITIONALLY EXPRESSED?

21:16.008 --> 21:19.312
YOU'VE THOUGHT AHEAD.
COMMENDABLE.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.580
MM-HMM.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.851
MY FRIENDS MAY STILL
COME LOOKING FOR YOU,
FOR AN EXPLANATION.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.753
I'LL HAVE ONE PREPARED.

21:26.786 --> 21:31.358
AND SHOULD YOU COME
ACROSS ANY MORE STONES
ON A SIMILAR BASIS...

21:31.391 --> 21:32.792
THANK YOU.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.827
QUITE GOOD STONES,
BY THE WAY.

21:34.861 --> 21:35.795
WE SHOULD DO WELL.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.764
WHAT ARE YOU HOPING
TO REALIZE?

21:37.797 --> 21:38.631
5 MILLION DOLLARS.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.833
SHEIKH DASANI
AND HIS ASSOCIATES

21:40.867 --> 21:43.169
HAVE GREAT USE FOR
UNTRACEABLE DIAMONDS.

21:43.202 --> 21:46.138
YOU VERY WELL
MAY GET IT.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.549
[HELICOPTER]

22:34.621 --> 22:37.990
SHEIKH DASANI,
AS ALWAYS, AN HONOR.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.794
[SPEAKING
NATIVE LANGUAGE]

22:46.799 --> 22:49.602
I REGRET HE IS NOT HERE.

23:05.785 --> 23:06.753
"ITEM ONE."

23:06.786 --> 23:10.790
"PRESENTED AS: ROUGH,
APPROXIMATELY 430 CARATS."

23:10.823 --> 23:13.726
SHOULD YOU CARE TO BID
BY WEIGHT OR BY STONE,

23:13.760 --> 23:17.997
THE FINAL PRICE WILL,
OF COURSE, BE ADJUSTED TO...

23:18.330 --> 23:22.368
LET US SUPPOSE THE WEIGHT,
AND THE FINAL SETTLEMENT WILL,

23:22.401 --> 23:25.438
OF COURSE, REFLECT THE
MUTUALLY DETERMINED VOLUME.

23:25.472 --> 23:29.208
SHALL WE BEGIN, AT, SAY,
4 MILLION DOLLARS?

TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

26:47.139 --> 26:47.940

26:58.718 --> 26:59.752
I'D SAY YOU DID.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.621
AND HOW WOULD YOU
CHARACTERIZE THAT VICTORY?

27:02.655 --> 27:03.355
I--

27:03.389 --> 27:04.556
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:04.590 --> 27:08.094
YOUR LEAFLET SAYS "THE COST
OF ARROGANCE IS PAID IN BLOOD."

27:08.127 --> 27:11.263
AND I JOKED ABOUT IT.
BUT THAT'S TRUE. AND--

27:11.297 --> 27:12.231
NO, PLEASE

27:12.264 --> 27:14.600

AND THE BLOOD IS OURS.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.501
GO ON.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.469
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IT IS ARROGANT TO THINK

27:17.503 --> 27:18.938
THAT IF OTHER PEOPLE
JUST KNEW HOW WELL

27:18.971 --> 27:23.743
WE THOUGHT OF OURSELVES,
THEY'D STOP TRYING TO KILL US.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.948
WELL. YOU GIVE ME
A MOMENT'S PAUSE.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.350

CONTINUE THE DEBATE.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.559
I DON'T THINK SO.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.472
THE DEAL, AS ALWAYS:
YOU CAN HAVE IT GOOD,

27:53.505 --> 27:55.742
YOU CAN HAVE IT FAST,
OR YOU CAN HAVE IT TUESDAY.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.077

35:42.374 --> 35:44.276
WELL, I FIGURED
YOU DID, AS, LATELY,

35:44.310 --> 35:46.312
YOU LOOK LIKE THE DOG DIED.
GO ON, THEN.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.647
THE DIAMONDS THE TEAM
STOLE IN ITALY.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.781
YEAH. I SEEM TO REMEMBER,

35:49.815 --> 35:50.649
WE SOLD THEM
TO THE SHEIKH.

35:50.682 --> 35:53.018
AH, YES, THE SHEIKH.
4.5 MILLION DOLLARS,

35:53.051 --> 35:54.453
9 PACKAGES
OF ROUGH CUT DIAMONDS.

35:54.486 --> 35:57.623
BUT ORIGINALLY
THERE WERE 10 PACKAGES
OF UNCUT DIAMONDS.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.225
YOU KEPT ONE OUT.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.126
THIS ON?

36:01.159 --> 36:02.861
AS YOU RECALL,
ART SPEY HERE

36:02.894 --> 36:06.832
WANTED TO INDUCT
YOU INTO A LITTLE
SECRET OF THE UNIT.

36:06.865 --> 36:07.966
THE STILL

36:07.999 --> 36:10.336
NO. IT AIN'T
EXACTLY THE STILL.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.003
ONCE IN, NEVER OUT.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.472
WELL, HERE I AM.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.341
WHAT'S BEEN GOING
ON HERE, BOB?

36:15.374 --> 36:17.008
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.076
"THE BEGINNING?"

36:18.109 --> 36:20.712
SINCE THE INCEPTION
OF THE UNIT. IT, UH...

36:20.746 --> 36:21.880
IT DOESN'T HAVE A NAME.

36:21.913 --> 36:24.483
YOU MIGHT THINK OF IT
AS AN ESCAPE HATCH.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.919
SOMETIMES, BABY.
NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.921
YOU, OR ANOTHER GUY.
LIKE YOU.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.857
A UNIT MEMBER
HAS TO DISAPPEAR.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.492
BREAK IT ON DOWN.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.893
YOU REMEMBER
THE BAY OF PIGS?

36:34.926 --> 36:36.262
MM-HMM.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.696
SOMETIMES...

36:37.729 --> 36:40.666
THE GOVERNMENT,
SAY, IT HAS TO DISAVOW

36:40.699 --> 36:43.902
THOSE WHOM IT HAS SENT
TO DO ITS BIDDING.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.203
IT'S HAPPENED
IN THE PAST.

36:45.237 --> 36:49.241
AT TIME THIS MAN
AND HIS FAMILY

36:49.275 --> 36:53.011
HAVE ACCESS
TO FUNDS, FRIENDS,
A NEW IDENTITY.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.513
AND A NEW LIFE.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.282
A UNIT MEMBER
HAS TO DISAPPEAR.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.849
IT'S
HAPPENED BEFORE.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.751
A MAN HAS TO WALK AWAY
AND CAN'T COME BACK.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.019
HOW IS IT PAID FOR?

37:01.052 --> 37:04.723
IT'S FUNDED THROUGH TAXES--

37:04.756 --> 37:08.226
PAID TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF THE TREASURY.

37:08.260 --> 37:11.330
THAT WOULD BE ME.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.756
TESTING, TESTING. 1, 2.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.257
UH, GOOD AFTERNOON.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.626
MY NAME
IS GEORGE TATELMAN.

37:40.659 --> 37:41.993
AND I AM
THE STATION MANAGER

37:42.027 --> 37:45.130

MARGARET?

38:09.788 --> 38:13.692

A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

38:25.537 --> 38:26.705
FOR THE SERVICE
MEN AND WOMEN

38:26.738 --> 38:29.575
WHO ACTUALLY DID
THE RESTORATION PLEASE?

38:31.577 --> 38:33.044
NOW THIS JEEP
HAS A HISTORY.

38:33.078 --> 38:36.682
IT WAS DRIVEN IN COMBAT
BY SERGEANT JAMES HANSON.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.284

IT WAS HIS LAST
LETTER THAT HE WROTE,

42:03.789 --> 42:08.059
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO READ IT TO YOU.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.267
"OH, MY DARLING.

"THERE IS A LULL
IN THE SHOOTING,

"IF GOD GRANTS
ME THAT MOMENT

42:37.388 --> 42:39.357
"FOR ONE LAST GOOD-BYE,

42:39.390 --> 42:43.762
"THAT THOUGHT

42:43.795 --> 42:48.600
MY DARLING MIDGE."

43:02.513 --> 43:05.416
I'M MIDGE.

43:06.484 --> 43:08.419
WHAT?

43:08.920 --> 43:12.023
I'M MIDGE.
