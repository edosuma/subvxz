00:01.200 --> 00:03.300
My name is 
Melinda Gordon.

00:03.400 --> 00:04.700
I'm married,

00:04.800 --> 00:06.900
I live in a small town,

00:07.000 --> 00:08.900
and I own an antique shop.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I might be just like you,

00:11.100 --> 00:12.800
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:12.900 --> 00:15.100
I knew that I could
talk to the dead.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.500
It's all right, honey.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.800
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:19.907 --> 00:22.400
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:22.503 --> 00:26.207
and they come to me for help.

00:27.706 --> 00:33.105
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:45.004 --> 00:47.606
15 strikeouts.
Unbelievable.

00:47.709 --> 00:49.400
Isn't that what he's supposed to do?

00:49.505 --> 00:52.001
- In one game?
- It's very good.

00:52.106 --> 00:54.201
All right. What do I know?
I played field hockey.

00:54.308 --> 00:56.802
You know, maybe it's not
too late for me to go pro.

00:56.905 --> 00:57.900
I was a great third baseman.

00:58.008 --> 01:00.802
Hey, I didn't know that you
played baseball in high school.

01:00.906 --> 01:03.202
I didn't.
Little league.

01:03.305 --> 01:07.501
I played a lot of years, though, huh?

01:08.007 --> 01:10.901
You know, I was 12
when I hit my first home run.

01:11.006 --> 01:12.802
I can still remember the pitch.
It was a low fastball.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.300
It was right over the middle of
the plate, and I golfed it, you know,

01:15.406 --> 01:16.902
right over the center field fence.

01:17.008 --> 01:18.403
Nice.

01:18.505 --> 01:20.402
I can still hear
my parents screaming.

01:20.506 --> 01:23.003
You know what? I would've
loved to have seen that.

01:23.106 --> 01:24.600
You can, actually.
My dad took a video.

01:24.705 --> 01:29.000
- Oh, I so want to see that.
- No. No.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.002
Let's do that again.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.100
That was incredible.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.502
Wait. We have to find out if
your mom still has the videotape

01:51.606 --> 01:53.400
of you getting
your first home run.

01:53.506 --> 01:54.803
Oh, she's got it.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.903
I swear, sometimes when I call her,
I can hear it playing in the background.

01:58.007 --> 02:03.701
What I want to know is, does she
still have my baseball cards?

02:12.407 --> 02:14.900
Wait here.

02:15.008 --> 02:18.400
Hey, sorry.
I'm an EMT.

02:40.808 --> 02:44.400
Justin, are you all right?

03:27.006 --> 03:28.601
Are you all right?

03:28.708 --> 03:31.900
Oh, yes. I think so.

04:02.207 --> 04:06.001
EPISODE 2x10
Giving Up a Ghost

04:08.305 --> 04:10.403
He collapsed on the field
exhibiting respiratory problems.

04:10.508 --> 04:15.900
He didn't loose consciousness.
He was awake, responsible.

04:16.308 --> 04:17.202
Let's move.

04:17.307 --> 04:18.202
How is he?

04:18.305 --> 04:19.500
Well, he's a little woozy.

04:19.608 --> 04:25.003
There's no sign of trauma,
and his nose stopped bleeding.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.001
We should go to the hospital.

04:27.106 --> 04:30.000
Why? He's up. He's talking.
I did everything I could.

04:30.108 --> 04:33.300
Yeah, but I haven't.

04:42.605 --> 04:45.101
So, the stadium lights,
was that some kind of warning?

04:45.208 --> 04:46.501
Felt like it.

04:46.605 --> 04:47.902
Hey...

04:48.007 --> 04:50.202
if you see a ghost in here,
tell me.

04:50.308 --> 04:52.901
- How? There's gonna be people around.
- Just give me a signal.

04:53.005 --> 04:54.801
Like what?
You want me to whistle?

04:54.905 --> 04:58.002
No, like a baseball signal.

04:58.106 --> 05:00.800
See, the first two mean nothing.
This, hit and run.

05:00.906 --> 05:03.603
Oh, don't tempt me.

05:03.708 --> 05:06.902
I really, all I want to know is how the
ghosts are affecting people, you know?

05:07.008 --> 05:10.700
So, just do something simple.

05:12.907 --> 05:14.602
What's that a sign for?

05:14.708 --> 05:17.301
All right.

05:24.606 --> 05:26.001
Hi, coach.

05:26.106 --> 05:29.102
Don't mean to bother you.
We just thought we'd stop by
and see if Justin is ok.

05:29.207 --> 05:32.200
We're still waiting.
Sorry we didn't get a chance
to meet back at the school.

05:32.306 --> 05:34.302
It was a little crazy.
I'm John Heath.

05:34.407 --> 05:36.700
Jim Clancy.
It's my wife Melinda.

05:36.807 --> 05:38.700
I'm Justin's mom, Tracy.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.602
Thank you so much for your help.

05:40.705 --> 05:42.001
It  was really scary.

05:42.105 --> 05:43.401
I think I'm still shaking.

05:43.508 --> 05:45.203
I'm sure he'll be ok.

05:45.306 --> 05:48.103
I hope so.
He worked so hard for this.

05:48.207 --> 05:53.001
Excuse me. I think I'm gonna go
check again. I hate this waiting.

05:53.108 --> 05:54.601
Hey, how was he
when they brought him in?

05:54.706 --> 05:57.603
Much better. He was telling everybody
he wanted to go home.

05:57.708 --> 06:00.101
I had to tell him to shut up
and get his butt back in the room.

06:00.208 --> 06:04.502
- Is his dad in there with him?
- No. His dad passed away.

06:04.607 --> 06:06.401
That's too bad.

06:06.506 --> 06:08.901
It's too bad he can't see
what his son is doing.

06:09.008 --> 06:11.802
Yeah, yeah.
He's doing very well.

06:11.906 --> 06:13.902
Hey, is this the first year
you're coaching at Grandview?

06:14.007 --> 06:16.500
Second. I was in Chicago before.

06:16.607 --> 06:18.602
When I got a chance to come back home,
I jumped at it.

06:18.705 --> 06:21.102
I was born and raised
right here in Grandview.

06:21.207 --> 06:24.103
There they are.

06:24.705 --> 06:27.903
There's nothing wrong with me.
They didn't find anything, ok?

06:28.006 --> 06:29.600
The tests are negative.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.202
Probably was a sudden drop
of blood pressure,

06:31.305 --> 06:33.500
maybe brought on by
the exertion of the game.

06:33.605 --> 06:35.603
Just take it easy for a day.

06:35.707 --> 06:37.502
Thank you, doctor.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.200
Ok. You sure you're all right?

06:39.308 --> 06:40.703
He'll be good.

06:40.806 --> 06:43.300
Thanks a lot.

06:43.406 --> 06:44.802
So, what, no ghost?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.300
"Just give me a signal."

06:46.406 --> 06:49.203
I signaled you 5 times,
this whole thing.

06:49.306 --> 06:50.701
What's that?

06:50.805 --> 06:52.001
This is the signal.

06:52.106 --> 06:55.502
What is it that you wanted me to do,
give you a sign before the sign?

06:55.606 --> 06:57.102
How about I sing
"some enchanted evening"

06:57.207 --> 06:59.303
or do a cartwheel down the hall
because you wouldn't have missed that.

06:59.406 --> 07:02.202
Ok. I'm sorry.

07:03.807 --> 07:05.100
Well, was he with anybody?

07:05.208 --> 07:08.402
I don't know. He was all over the place,
but when he saw the coach, he was mad.

07:08.505 --> 07:11.002
So, you think the ghost
is attached to the coach.

07:11.105 --> 07:14.300
Well, maybe, but I don't think
Justin collapsed from exhaustion.

07:14.407 --> 07:15.700
That's why they couldn't find
anything wrong.

07:15.807 --> 07:20.400
No medical report is gonna
pick out a ghost.

07:28.207 --> 07:30.700
Get down!

07:38.907 --> 07:40.603
You all right?

07:40.705 --> 07:43.103
You ok?

07:46.805 --> 07:50.002
How do I explain 3 broken windows
to our insurance agent?

07:50.108 --> 07:51.200
It's vandalism.

07:51.308 --> 07:54.003
Let's just hope they don't ask
whether the vandal is dead or alive.

07:54.105 --> 07:57.103
You know, it's times like this
I wish I could see them.

07:57.207 --> 07:58.903
- Why?
- "Why?"

07:59.008 --> 08:02.400
So I could say, "Look, pal. What
the hell do you think you were doing?"

08:02.505 --> 08:04.903
Confrontation, not the best way
to deal with the dead.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.102
Well, he's got no trouble
confronting you or us.

08:07.205 --> 08:08.303
He just feels threatened.

08:08.406 --> 08:12.301
What, he breaks our windows,
and he feels threatened?

08:12.405 --> 08:13.801
You know. 

08:13.906 --> 08:15.701
Look. This is what I'm talking about.

08:15.806 --> 08:19.802
It's frustrating when the dead
can do more than I can.

08:19.905 --> 08:22.103
This ghost wants to hurt Justin
or the coach, I don't know.

08:22.206 --> 08:23.602
But what I do know is
that he's mad as hell

08:23.706 --> 08:25.401
and he doesn't want me
messing with him.

08:25.507 --> 08:27.803
And he wants to raise our deductible.

08:27.905 --> 08:31.102
Ok. Now I know two things.

08:31.205 --> 08:34.102
-  I just wish I could do more.
- You do a lot,

08:34.205 --> 08:37.600
and this ghost... well,

08:38.008 --> 08:42.900
he  can't do what you're
thinking about right now.

08:43.407 --> 08:46.200
Works for me.

09:45.905 --> 09:47.103
It was made about 1940.

09:47.307 --> 09:49.303
You turn the switch once,
and the lamp comes on,

09:49.407 --> 09:54.701
and then you turn it again,
and the skirt moves and makes it
look like she's hula dancing.

09:54.805 --> 09:57.203
Thanks.

10:01.806 --> 10:04.400
I guess everyone in town
is cleaning out their closets.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.407
Well, it's for a good cause.

10:06.506 --> 10:11.505
I actually found stuff I thought
I gave away a long time ago.

10:11.604 --> 10:12.806
Hey, you going to the game tonight?

10:12.909 --> 10:13.803
Are you kidding me?

10:13.908 --> 10:16.102
Jim would rather miss his own funeral
than the big playoff game.

10:16.207 --> 10:19.502
Well, you better get there early
because everybody I know is going.

10:19.606 --> 10:20.901
I'll see you at the game.

10:21.006 --> 10:26.500
All right, but whoever gets there first
has to save seats.

11:09.005 --> 11:12.100
Hey! You ok, lady?

11:20.208 --> 11:22.400
Wait, wait. You think Grandview
high school is haunted?

11:22.505 --> 11:24.700
It is a high school,
and I know a few unresolved issues

11:24.806 --> 11:26.700
that would keep me
from crossing over, Jim.

11:26.808 --> 11:28.803
But you didn't actually see
a ghost there, did you?

11:28.905 --> 11:31.000
No, not yet,
but I think there was a ghost there

11:31.105 --> 11:32.600
that definitely wanted me
to stay away.

11:32.708 --> 11:33.901
Sorry about that.

11:34.007 --> 11:35.503
There's got to be a rational
explanation, you know...

11:35.607 --> 11:38.302
sewage gas, mutant cockroaches.

11:38.408 --> 11:43.303
If I ever see a mutant cockroach,
you have to deal with it.

11:43.406 --> 11:46.202
I'm your man.

12:32.705 --> 12:34.901
- I'm tired of it being all about him.
- You don't think we're all like that?

12:35.007 --> 12:40.800
Yeah, but I'm only 60 feet away.
At least you're in left field.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.501
What are you doing?

12:55.807 --> 12:58.603
What did you want with him?

12:58.705 --> 13:01.103
"Him"?

13:01.806 --> 13:04.601
- Justin...
- Stay away from him.

13:04.705 --> 13:07.101
I know who you are.
Matt Vonner.

13:07.205 --> 13:09.400
No!

13:19.208 --> 13:22.501
Justin, don't do this.

13:23.806 --> 13:26.001
Matt... no.

13:26.105 --> 13:27.301
Who are you!?

13:27.405 --> 13:30.900
Justin, what the hell are you doing!?

13:31.005 --> 13:34.001
Stay out of this.

13:36.005 --> 13:38.400
- I want to know what was going on.
- She broke it, ok?

13:38.505 --> 13:42.100
- Get off me.
- Don't you walk away.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.200
You know, just keep her away from me.

13:44.306 --> 13:48.803
You stop right now, or you're gonna be
on the bench for saturday's game.

13:48.906 --> 13:52.003
You know, I'm the only reason
we're in the playoffs.

13:52.106 --> 13:54.003
And you know that.

13:54.108 --> 13:57.300
If I don't play, you'll lose.

13:57.407 --> 13:59.101
Watch your mouth, kid.

13:59.207 --> 14:02.401
You know...
I made it, Jackie Boy,

14:02.507 --> 14:04.101
and you didn't.

14:04.207 --> 14:05.302
But...

14:05.405 --> 14:07.801
you never were good enough...

14:07.907 --> 14:11.002
and you know that.

14:22.906 --> 14:26.003
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.400
I saw what happened. I understand
if you want to press charges.

14:28.505 --> 14:29.703
I don't.

14:29.807 --> 14:31.503
He wasn't himself.

14:31.606 --> 14:32.700
Look. I'm gonna have to report this.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.503
I don't know what's
going on with him lately,

14:34.606 --> 14:37.001
but he's out of control.
I need to know what happened.

14:37.105 --> 14:38.902
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.202
It was probably something
I said to him.

14:41.305 --> 14:43.200
Look. I don't care what kind
of pressure a kid is under.

14:43.306 --> 14:44.502
There is no excuse for this.

14:44.605 --> 14:50.700
You know, I really have to think
about this. I'm sorry. I have to go.

14:58.805 --> 15:02.800
Got a buyer for the fishing lures.

15:05.306 --> 15:08.302
That's the Crazy Crawler,
made by Heddon in 1944.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.903
The other one is the Wotta Frog,
made by Paw Paw in 1942.

15:11.006 --> 15:13.601
- Who's it for?
- My husband. He's a collector.

15:13.705 --> 15:17.000
Oh, well, if you really
want to be a hero...

15:17.105 --> 15:18.100
The Vampire.

15:18.205 --> 15:20.203
It's extremely rare, made in 1924.

15:20.306 --> 15:22.002
No. I'm sorry, 1923.

15:22.108 --> 15:25.400
Oh, my goodness, I am never
bringing my husband in here.

15:25.508 --> 15:29.800
You are the wife he always dreamed of,
and I kept telling him you don't exist.

15:29.906 --> 15:32.003
Mel! Look, I just heard what happened.

15:32.105 --> 15:33.403
I'm trying to stay calm.

15:33.507 --> 15:35.402
- Ok, Jim.
- No, but I'm gonna tear his head off.

15:35.506 --> 15:37.101
Jim!

15:37.205 --> 15:40.000
Back room, please.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.302
Thanks.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.601
Hi.

15:47.107 --> 15:48.602
It wasn't Justin.
It was Matt Vonner.

15:48.707 --> 15:51.500
Well, who the hell is Matt Vonner?

15:51.605 --> 15:53.602
All right. So, it's Matt Vonner.
I'll tear his head off.

15:53.707 --> 15:58.302
Too late. He's already dead.
He's the ghost.

15:58.606 --> 16:00.303
Matt Vonner, the baseball player?

16:00.406 --> 16:02.603
Yeah. He was the one that
I saw at the game the other night.

16:02.706 --> 16:04.101
He was also there today.

16:04.206 --> 16:07.700
He's haunting Justin, not the coach,
and Justin has no idea what happened to him.

16:07.808 --> 16:10.501
All right. Then the question is,
if I punch Justin hard enough,

16:10.606 --> 16:13.300
- will Matt Vonner the ghost feel it?
- You're not helping.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.001
Honey, just tell me first, ok,

16:15.107 --> 16:16.603
so I don't hear it from Bob
at the station,

16:16.706 --> 16:17.902
who heard it from his brother Harry,

16:18.006 --> 16:21.001
who heard it from his kid
who plays catcher.

16:21.108 --> 16:22.300
What?

16:22.408 --> 16:26.402
Ok. My bad, but when I realized
who the ghost was...

16:26.506 --> 16:28.301
Wow, Matt Vonner.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.600
"Graduated from Grandview in '90."

16:30.707 --> 16:32.301
And signed with the Chicago Cubs
the same year.

16:32.407 --> 16:35.100
He spent a year in the minor leagues,
then got traded to the White Sox.

16:35.205 --> 16:38.902
He won rookie of the year and came in
second for the Sid Young Award 3 times.

16:39.006 --> 16:40.102
- "Sid"?
- Yeah.

16:40.205 --> 16:41.602
That's an award
they give out for pitching,

16:41.708 --> 16:43.602
and you thought
I didn't know anything about baseball.

16:43.706 --> 16:45.903
Cy.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.202
Cy Young.
He was an old pitcher a long time ago.

16:48.306 --> 16:49.400
Oh, Sid, Cy, whatever.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.300
You know, I remember reading about this guy.

16:51.408 --> 16:54.101
Now, he was amazing,
and then he just went downhill.

16:54.206 --> 16:57.600
I don't know what happened.
It was drugs or gambling or something.

16:57.707 --> 17:01.101
Wow, I remember how surprised
people were. He just fell apart.

17:01.207 --> 17:03.302
But why would he want
to haunt Justin?

17:03.406 --> 17:05.502
I don't know.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.900
You know, Justin has been recruited by,
like, 5 major league teams,

17:09.007 --> 17:12.200
I mean, the A's, The Yankees,
The Red Sox, The Braves.

17:12.308 --> 17:15.602
Maybe  he wants to hurt Justin
so Justin can't make the bigs.

17:15.704 --> 17:16.803
- "Bigs"?
- Majors.

17:16.906 --> 17:17.702
Makes sense. 

17:17.805 --> 17:19.101
That is a possibility,
but either way,

17:19.205 --> 17:20.900
I have to let Justin know
what's happening to him.

17:21.008 --> 17:24.602
All right, but with me this time, ok?

17:24.707 --> 17:27.301
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:27.405 --> 17:31.103
Do we have any Noguchi lamps?

17:31.807 --> 17:32.700
Duty calls.

17:32.805 --> 17:35.100
We will talk some more about
the mutant cockroaches later.

17:35.205 --> 17:38.303
- Yeah, and I'll get you that
chemical bug spray. - Great.

17:38.405 --> 17:43.003
You  guys have your own code.
That's so cute.

17:45.106 --> 17:48.403
My mom saved the video...

17:48.506 --> 17:50.800
All 14 hours.

17:50.907 --> 17:52.400
Ready for a Jim marathon?

17:52.605 --> 17:53.701
Is that really you?

17:53.807 --> 17:57.800
Come on. Can't you tell?
Look at the pecs. That kid is cut.

17:57.905 --> 17:59.503
What is all this?

17:59.607 --> 18:03.000
My mother is the greatest
living human being on earth.

18:03.106 --> 18:06.600
She saved all my baseball stuff,
everything.

18:06.708 --> 18:07.800
And look at this.

18:07.907 --> 18:12.101
These are the cards my dad collected
when he was a kid.

18:12.206 --> 18:17.802
I mean, look at these names.
Mantle, Mays, Koufax, Clemente.

18:18.907 --> 18:21.100
That's Reggie Jackson.

18:21.207 --> 18:23.800
I saw him play once.
My dad took me.

18:23.905 --> 18:26.503
We had seats right behind home plate.

18:26.607 --> 18:29.803
That day, Reggie hit 4 home runs.
It's the truth.

18:29.907 --> 18:33.500
That was the last game my dad and I
ever went to together.

18:33.605 --> 18:35.401
It's weird.

18:35.506 --> 18:37.101
Oh. Here it is.

18:37.207 --> 18:41.600
I think I hit a double here in this one.

18:42.208 --> 18:48.301
- Maybe it's the next pitch.
- Now I know why they call it a double.

18:52.508 --> 18:53.701
Hey.

18:53.807 --> 18:55.603
Came here...

18:55.706 --> 18:57.902
Came here to say I'm sorry.

18:58.008 --> 19:00.500
I don't know why I did what I did.

19:00.605 --> 19:03.102
Come in.

19:05.407 --> 19:07.300
You got to be kidding me.

19:07.405 --> 19:08.502
You come into our house?

19:08.607 --> 19:09.501
Jim...

19:09.608 --> 19:11.403
I said I was sorry.

19:11.505 --> 19:13.901
I feel really bad about it.

19:14.008 --> 19:17.001
- I just need to talk to you.
- I need to talk to you, too.

19:17.108 --> 19:19.001
Can you get us some drinks?

19:19.108 --> 19:20.903
Yeah.

19:21.006 --> 19:26.201
Hey, I'll be in the kitchen,
you know, the next room.

19:26.306 --> 19:28.300
Did your coach ask you to come here?

19:28.408 --> 19:30.703
No, my mom.

19:30.806 --> 19:33.502
Coach suspended me.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.800
I need you to talk to him for me.
I can't be suspended.

19:36.906 --> 19:38.302
And none of this is
what you think it is.

19:38.406 --> 19:41.603
I don't take anything.

19:41.706 --> 19:43.503
No drugs, nothing.

19:43.606 --> 19:46.003
I know I get nosebleeds,
which is, like, a sign of it,

19:46.107 --> 19:49.602
I know, but I'm not on anything.

19:49.705 --> 19:52.201
I work my ass off every day.
I've been doing this since I was 5,

19:52.307 --> 19:54.400
and everybody thinks that
I'm on something, but I'm not.

19:54.506 --> 19:58.602
- I mean, we get tested.
- Look. I'm not the steroid police.

19:58.705 --> 20:00.803
Well, isn't that why
you've been following me around?

20:00.905 --> 20:04.400
You've got a different problem.

20:04.506 --> 20:08.102
Ok. You don't understand.
This is all I've ever wanted to do.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.403
It's the one thing
I've always been good at.

20:10.505 --> 20:14.602
It's the only thing
that's made my dad proud of me.

20:14.705 --> 20:17.502
What happens when you go out
to play on the field,

20:17.608 --> 20:20.900
when you start to pitch?
Do you feel anything different?

20:21.007 --> 20:22.803
I don't know.
I just...

20:22.908 --> 20:26.303
I feel like I can't lose.
I feel stronger.

20:26.407 --> 20:29.102
- It's kind of hard to describe.
- Do you know who Matt Vonner is?

20:29.208 --> 20:30.602
Of course, yeah.
Everybody does.

20:30.706 --> 20:34.402
When you're out on that field,
it's him.

20:34.507 --> 20:37.302
What? I don't know what you mean.
Matt Vonner is dead.

20:37.408 --> 20:39.503
Justin...

20:39.606 --> 20:42.502
it's his spirit.

20:42.608 --> 20:43.101
A ghost?

20:43.207 --> 20:46.300
You're telling me that there's
a ghost out on the field with me?

20:46.407 --> 20:48.400
No, not with you. In you.

20:48.507 --> 20:51.902
That's why you've been having
the nosebleeds. He's using you.

20:52.007 --> 20:54.201
When I'm pitching.
That's what you think.

20:54.308 --> 20:55.601
It doesn't mean
that you're not good,

20:55.706 --> 20:57.803
but he is controlling you
when you're out there.

20:57.905 --> 21:00.403
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not, and you know it.

21:00.508 --> 21:03.202
Deep inside, you know it.
We have to get rid of him.

21:03.308 --> 21:04.302
No.

21:04.406 --> 21:08.101
It is me out there. It's not him.
It's not anything else. It's me.

21:08.206 --> 21:09.203
He's gonna hurt you. 

21:09.306 --> 21:12.802
Even if what you say is true,
he's making me great.

21:12.907 --> 21:16.203
Do you think I want to give that up?
Do you think I can give that up?

21:16.308 --> 21:18.100
I am better than I've ever been,

21:18.205 --> 21:23.703
and even if I knew how to change that,
I wouldn't want to.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.503
Justin...

21:26.605 --> 21:29.003
Justin!

21:30.507 --> 21:31.701
Leave him alone!

21:31.806 --> 21:34.003
M el?

21:35.005 --> 21:38.002
I'm gonna win again.
I'm gonna be great again.

21:38.106 --> 21:41.002
Justin is the best player
to come through here since me.

21:41.108 --> 21:44.003
I'm taking him all the way.

21:44.108 --> 21:46.400
Justin isn't playing.
Is that what you want?

21:46.607 --> 21:47.400
The coach?

21:47.507 --> 21:49.102
That's the son of a bitch
who killed me.

21:49.206 --> 21:52.001
He killed me!

21:52.408 --> 21:54.901
Melinda.

21:58.505 --> 22:01.802
- You ok?
- Yeah. You?

22:05.005 --> 22:07.603
They reversed your decision?
How can they do that?

22:07.707 --> 22:09.603
They're the school board.
It's what they do.

22:09.707 --> 22:12.202
They do what they want,
and they didn't reverse it.

22:12.307 --> 22:17.003
They just won't approve my decision
until they review the charges next week,

22:17.106 --> 22:19.302
which really just means they're
gonna make sure Justin

22:19.406 --> 22:21.902
pitches in saturday's championship game.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.801
Does Justin know that?

22:23.905 --> 22:25.203
Eh, beats me.

22:25.308 --> 22:27.603
I'm not the coach anymore.

22:27.707 --> 22:28.901
What?

22:29.008 --> 22:31.002
I told them if Justin played,
I wouldn't coach.

22:31.105 --> 22:32.003
They agreed.

22:32.106 --> 22:35.000
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's ok.

22:35.107 --> 22:37.103
Not as much fun as it used to be, anyway.

22:37.205 --> 22:40.202
Used to be about playing.
Now it's about winning.

22:40.308 --> 22:44.703
I don't know what's happened to Justin.
I mean, he was like my own kid.

22:44.806 --> 22:49.002
Every day, I would work with him,
and now, the last 4 months,

22:49.107 --> 22:53.902
it's like I don't even know
who he is anymore.

23:06.207 --> 23:08.401
Hey, I wonder what happened to coach.

23:08.505 --> 23:11.703
I hear he got fired.

23:13.405 --> 23:16.302
Anybody know why?

23:16.405 --> 23:19.103
Maybe he made a bad decision.

23:19.205 --> 23:20.603
You're the one
that shouldn't be out there.

23:20.708 --> 23:25.200
Then why don't you do something about it?

23:26.608 --> 23:28.200
None of us want to go out there
if he pitches.

23:28.308 --> 23:30.201
Why don't you tell us
how the coach got fired, Justin?

23:30.307 --> 23:31.701
Hey, hey, hey, cut it out.

23:31.807 --> 23:33.400
Break it.

23:33.507 --> 23:35.801
Move back.

23:35.906 --> 23:39.100
Justin, take a walk.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.502
What the hell happened to you, man?

23:47.605 --> 23:50.600
I need to talk to you about something.

23:50.707 --> 23:52.500
Someone.

23:52.606 --> 23:54.800
Someone I know?

23:54.905 --> 23:57.600
Matt Vonner.

24:00.806 --> 24:05.001
Well, we grew up together,
played on the same teams, but...

24:05.107 --> 24:08.803
Matt was always the big deal,

24:09.207 --> 24:11.803
a lot like Justin is now.

24:11.906 --> 24:15.802
Were you with him when he died?

24:15.907 --> 24:17.103
Yeah. Why?

24:17.206 --> 24:19.402
He blames you.

24:19.506 --> 24:20.900
What do you mean?

24:21.005 --> 24:25.403
- He says you killed him.
- He says I killed him?

24:25.506 --> 24:30.700
Look. It was Matt that grabbed me
that day at school, not Justin.

24:30.806 --> 24:35.000
Ok. You're gonna have to
catch me up a little here.

24:35.106 --> 24:38.803
- You saw Matt Vonner?
- Yes.

24:40.405 --> 24:43.501
You know he's dead.

24:43.807 --> 24:46.000
I know how it sounds,

24:46.107 --> 24:48.103
but Matt's spirit is still here,

24:48.208 --> 24:51.001
and that's why Justin is pitching
so well, and he knows it.

24:51.107 --> 24:53.400
- You know what's weird?
- What?

24:53.508 --> 24:56.000
He's been in my dreams lately,
Matt,

24:56.108 --> 24:59.102
and the accident.

25:00.008 --> 25:02.301
Tell me what happened that night.

25:02.408 --> 25:06.801
We both got drafted the same year
right out of high school.

25:06.906 --> 25:11.501
Matt went straight to the bigs,
and I spent 8 years in the minors.

25:11.605 --> 25:14.100
Then one day, I got called up.

25:14.206 --> 25:19.200
I was beyond excited, playing in
the bigs alongside my best friend.

25:19.308 --> 25:21.403
Flew into Chicago.

25:21.508 --> 25:23.203
Took a cab ride over to his place.

25:23.307 --> 25:26.803
I mean, he wanted to be the one
to bring me to my first game and...

25:26.907 --> 25:31.302
he had a lot of problems by then,
but...

25:32.206 --> 25:35.903
he was ready for his comeback.

25:36.005 --> 25:40.301
Then on the ride over to the stadium...

25:43.008 --> 25:45.403
- I'm going to the bigs.
- You're going to the show, baby.

25:45.505 --> 25:47.501
You're going to the show.

25:47.608 --> 25:50.102
Look out!

26:05.308 --> 26:07.202
Matt was killed,

26:07.305 --> 26:10.003
and that was the end of it for me, too.

26:10.108 --> 26:12.702
If this is real,

26:12.805 --> 26:15.801
why would he be doing this?

26:15.905 --> 26:20.101
I think that he's trying to give
himself another chance by using Justin.

26:20.207 --> 26:24.302
It's like you said. Everything is
about winning, even in death.

26:24.407 --> 26:28.402
I don't really believe
in anything too much.

26:28.507 --> 26:30.800
I pray when I get on the plane,
that's about it.

26:30.908 --> 26:34.401
But if Matt really is still here
and he's doing this to Justin,

26:34.507 --> 26:38.103
he's messing up a good kid.

26:38.407 --> 26:41.903
Tell me what I need to do.

26:42.008 --> 26:43.702
Can you talk to Justin?

26:43.808 --> 26:45.603
He's afraid that he'll
fail without Matt.

26:45.706 --> 26:48.600
This is the biggest game
of his entire life.

26:48.707 --> 26:51.603
He's got scouts from 6 different
major league teams looking at him.

26:51.707 --> 26:55.701
I mean, what am I gonna tell him,
"don't pitch"?

26:55.805 --> 27:00.300
Well, then maybe
you should talk to Matt.

27:11.707 --> 27:13.502
Justin.

27:13.605 --> 27:14.900
What are you doing here?

27:15.007 --> 27:17.601
I want you to tell me
what happens when you come out here.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.503
We're trying to figure
what's going on.

27:19.608 --> 27:21.002
You believe her?

27:21.107 --> 27:22.500
Justin, you can stop this.

27:22.607 --> 27:25.903
You know, I'm sorry about what happened
to you, but that's your fault, not mine.

27:26.008 --> 27:29.701
She shouldn't have come near me.
I have nothing to do with her.

27:29.808 --> 27:32.802
He's behind you.

27:33.006 --> 27:35.102
Justin, don't let him...
Matt!

27:35.207 --> 27:38.303
Matt don't do this!

27:40.105 --> 27:42.800
Oh, my god.

27:43.807 --> 27:46.502
Jackie Boy.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.901
You know, I really wish you were
catching for me tonight.

27:49.007 --> 27:52.302
Be like old times.
You're too old now, man.

27:52.406 --> 27:58.002
You're not gonna pitch tonight.
I'm not gonna let it happen.

28:13.007 --> 28:14.601
Just get away from him. Go!

28:14.707 --> 28:17.302
You're gonna ruin him
just like you ruined yourself.

28:17.407 --> 28:20.403
Run Justin! Run!

28:23.408 --> 28:26.700
Where the hell is he?

28:28.208 --> 28:31.001
To your right.

28:33.206 --> 28:36.602
I'm gonna tell you something
I should've told you 10 years ago.

28:36.708 --> 28:38.702
You were a damn good pitcher, Matt,

28:38.808 --> 28:40.702
but you weren't that much
better than anyone else.

28:40.805 --> 28:45.400
You just thought you were
because of what you did to yourself.

28:45.505 --> 28:48.302
I remember that one game
when you shot up.

28:48.405 --> 28:49.802
We were right here in Grandview.

28:49.905 --> 28:53.301
Said it was just once, just to see
if it would help give you an edge,

28:53.406 --> 28:56.900
get us into the playoffs,
and you got us in, I guess,

28:57.007 --> 28:58.303
but I never really felt right about it.

28:58.407 --> 29:01.601
I never felt like
we really won that game.

29:01.705 --> 29:05.101
Everybody else always remembers
what a great game it was.

29:05.205 --> 29:06.503
Not me.

29:06.606 --> 29:09.300
Then you'd jack yourself up
another time and another time,

29:09.405 --> 29:12.403
and somewhere in there, you just...

29:12.508 --> 29:14.703
you forgot how to play
the game without it.

29:14.808 --> 29:17.203
You didn't just kill yourself, Matt.

29:17.305 --> 29:18.800
You killed the game.

29:18.908 --> 29:22.001
You can't talk to me like this.
He's the reason I'm dead.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.000
He thinks that you're
responsible for his death.

29:24.105 --> 29:27.303
You're wrong, Matt.
You were driving, not me.

29:27.406 --> 29:33.500
You were so jacked up that night,
you didn't know what was going on.

29:36.606 --> 29:42.600
Uh, I don't know what to say.
It was my first game, my big chance.

29:48.105 --> 29:50.300
You don't know what it takes
to survive up here. You don't know.

29:50.406 --> 29:52.003
Ok. Fine. I don't know.

29:52.107 --> 29:54.202
Thought I'd do you a favor
by giving you a ride to the game.

29:54.308 --> 29:56.500
Matt, just drop it.

29:56.605 --> 29:58.701
You want to know something?

29:58.808 --> 30:01.800
If it wasn't for me asking for you,
they never would've called you up.

30:01.906 --> 30:02.300
What?

30:02.406 --> 30:06.003
Yeah, I thought you'd be my good-luck
charm, like the way it used to be,

30:06.105 --> 30:09.101
but if you think you can compete
in the bigs without doing what I do,

30:09.205 --> 30:11.802
you're gonna be catching washouts
in Little Rock by next weekend.

30:11.906 --> 30:14.000
The last thing you said to me was,

30:14.107 --> 30:19.700
"get with the program, Jackie Boy,
or be happy riding pine."

30:21.805 --> 30:24.000
No!

30:42.605 --> 30:44.403
Uhh, don't leave me here.

30:44.506 --> 30:47.703
Don't leave me here.

30:53.008 --> 30:55.001
He saved himself and left me to die.

30:55.108 --> 30:58.003
- Tell him I know what he did.
- I'm not gonna tell him that.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.600
I tried to save that son of a bitch.

31:01.708 --> 31:05.002
It costs me my career.

31:20.805 --> 31:23.301
- Coach said he tried to save you.
- He's a liar.

31:23.406 --> 31:27.100
Said it cost him his career.

31:28.406 --> 31:30.200
I saw something.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.703
I remember something.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.802
Because of what you were on,
you weren't clear.

31:33.907 --> 31:36.303
You have to see what
really happened now, Matt,

31:36.408 --> 31:41.402
and you can do that now.
You can see what you did.

31:55.905 --> 31:57.902
Don't leave me here, Jackie.

31:58.007 --> 32:01.202
Don't leave me here.

32:03.708 --> 32:06.802
Come on.
I got you.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.601
Matt!

32:25.406 --> 32:26.900
Matt! Come on!

32:27.008 --> 32:29.102
Stay with me!

32:29.206 --> 32:31.402
No!

32:33.108 --> 32:35.402
How could I not have remembered that?

32:35.506 --> 32:38.502
You were thinking only
of what happened to you.

32:38.605 --> 32:40.803
You were so focused on your own pain
that you couldn't even see

32:40.905 --> 32:43.003
your friend was trying to save you.

32:43.105 --> 32:46.400
- I was dying.
- You were dead, Matt.

32:46.506 --> 32:50.702
You denied everything you did wrong.

32:51.107 --> 32:54.203
He lost it all because of me.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.302
How do I change it?

32:57.407 --> 33:00.600
The only thing you can do now
is make it right.

33:00.706 --> 33:03.102
Coach doesn't want anything from you,

33:03.208 --> 33:09.303
and Justin, the way you make it right
with him is by letting him go.

33:23.808 --> 33:25.201
I hit him.

33:25.307 --> 33:26.702
I hit coach.

33:26.807 --> 33:28.003
No, you didn't.

33:28.106 --> 33:31.603
Yeah. I did.
I felt it. It was my hand.

33:31.708 --> 33:33.803
I mean, he was always there for me.

33:33.907 --> 33:35.801
How could i do that to him?

33:35.908 --> 33:37.900
He knows that it wasn't you,

33:38.008 --> 33:40.902
that it was Matt,

33:41.006 --> 33:43.902
and Matt is here right now.

33:44.007 --> 33:45.402
It's ok.

33:45.508 --> 33:48.301
He just wants to talk.

33:48.408 --> 33:50.101
Tell him I was afraid,

33:50.207 --> 33:54.300
afraid of not being anyone anymore.

33:54.808 --> 33:56.903
He wants you to know
that he was afraid.

33:57.005 --> 33:59.100
I just wanted to play the game again,

33:59.206 --> 34:00.500
to pitch again.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.803
That's when I felt the most alive.

34:02.907 --> 34:04.403
That's why I used you.

34:04.508 --> 34:06.700
You're even better than I was.

34:06.808 --> 34:10.199
I wanted to be on top again.

34:10.308 --> 34:12.302
He thinks you're better than he was.

34:12.408 --> 34:14.303
That's why he used you.

34:14.407 --> 34:16.001
But I've hurt enough people,

34:16.108 --> 34:18.902
so I'm out of here.

34:19.007 --> 34:21.400
You're on your own.

34:21.507 --> 34:23.402
He's gonna cross over.

34:23.505 --> 34:26.001
He wants you to know
that you're on your own.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.703
What if I can't do this without him?

34:27.806 --> 34:30.000
Tell him...

34:30.106 --> 34:32.502
he never needed me.

34:32.606 --> 34:34.900
I needed you.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.801
He says that you never needed him.

34:36.907 --> 34:39.701
He needed you.

34:41.507 --> 34:43.502
He wants you to trust what you know.

34:43.607 --> 34:45.902
I'm not sure what I know anymore.

34:46.007 --> 34:48.502
Justin...

34:49.507 --> 34:52.902
Trust him, like I should have.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.100
Let him guide you.

34:56.206 --> 35:00.101
There's nobody better than him.

35:00.305 --> 35:02.900
Trust him.

35:04.506 --> 35:07.702
Need you to warm up.

35:07.807 --> 35:08.900
I don't know if I can play, coach.

35:09.006 --> 35:11.701
I don't care if you walk
the first 10 batters.

35:11.806 --> 35:13.303
I want you out there.

35:13.408 --> 35:15.900
Come on.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.402
Where's Matt?

35:51.505 --> 35:52.503
I don't know.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.000
I don't think he crossed over.

35:55.105 --> 36:00.802
Having him pitch tonight
might not have been such a good idea.

36:03.705 --> 36:06.700
I knew this would happen.
He thinks I'm out there.

36:06.808 --> 36:08.200
He's mixed up.

36:08.308 --> 36:12.301
He doesn't know the difference
between what I did to him
and just being scared.

36:12.405 --> 36:16.300
He's forgotten how to be afraid.

36:17.908 --> 36:20.300
Justin,

36:20.407 --> 36:24.301
he's not out there.
He's right here.

36:24.405 --> 36:27.402
I can't do this.

36:27.905 --> 36:29.801
Stop thinking with your head.
Think with your arm.

36:29.905 --> 36:31.900
He wants you to stop thinking
with your head.

36:32.008 --> 36:34.501
Think with your arm.

36:34.608 --> 36:35.603
Justin...

36:35.705 --> 36:38.300
What, man?

36:38.908 --> 36:41.101
I'm on your team.

36:41.208 --> 36:43.303
We all are.

36:43.408 --> 36:45.501
Yeah. Yeah.

36:45.607 --> 36:48.702
I'm sorry. I'm ok.

36:49.106 --> 36:53.102
Coach tells us you're
the reason he's back.

36:53.206 --> 36:56.101
Let's win this.

37:04.205 --> 37:06.603
You know,

37:06.708 --> 37:09.403
tell Matt...

37:09.907 --> 37:12.700
I'll do that.

37:21.908 --> 37:24.400
Yeah. I see it.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.703
Is that the light?

37:26.806 --> 37:30.503
I can't see it.
It's for you.

37:30.908 --> 37:34.102
Do I just walk into it?

37:34.208 --> 37:36.500
Yeah.

37:37.206 --> 37:42.900
Hey, do you think the Babe is
in there or Mantle or Cy Young?

37:43.508 --> 37:47.302
Sorry. I don't have a program.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.902
You know what?

37:51.007 --> 37:53.901
I bet they are.

37:58.608 --> 38:00.600
Hey, one more thing.

38:00.705 --> 38:03.503
Tell Jackie Boy I'm sorry

38:03.607 --> 38:08.102
and tell Justin,
"throw for the corners."

38:10.905 --> 38:13.302
Is he here?

38:13.405 --> 38:15.400
No. He crossed over,

38:15.508 --> 38:18.201
but he wanted me to tell you
that he's sorry,

38:18.306 --> 38:21.102
and tell Justin
to throw for the corners.

38:21.208 --> 38:23.302
That's what I always
used to tell him to do.

38:23.407 --> 38:24.803
Play ball!

38:24.907 --> 38:27.803
Hey, good luck.

38:33.007 --> 38:35.001
So... Justin pitching.

38:35.105 --> 38:36.301
Yeah.

38:36.408 --> 38:37.503
Got any help?

38:37.608 --> 38:40.601
8 other players.

38:41.805 --> 38:44.301
Come on.

39:33.208 --> 39:34.002
All right, kid.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.602
All right, Justin!

39:35.707 --> 39:39.002
Throw for the corners.

39:47.607 --> 39:50.302
Go, Justin!

39:55.607 --> 39:58.302
Oh, and it's going, going...

39:58.408 --> 40:01.103
gone. Home run.

40:01.205 --> 40:04.600
There he goes, the proud champion.

40:04.706 --> 40:07.703
My first and only home run.

40:07.806 --> 40:11.702
Well, the inning isn't over yet.

40:13.605 --> 40:15.901
Wait. There's a ghost in the house?

40:16.005 --> 40:16.902
Never mind.

40:17.008 --> 40:18.500
No. Do not follow me.

40:18.607 --> 40:23.000
- Do not follow me.
- I'm following you.
