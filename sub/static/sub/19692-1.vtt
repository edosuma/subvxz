47:25.469 --> 47:27.262
You saw his face?

47:27.387 --> 47:29.932
No, he was wearing a mask,
like a ski mask.

47:30.098 --> 47:33.560
Like a stalker on a TV show.
He got away.

47:33.685 --> 47:37.189
- Pat, go in with her.
- No, don't bother.

47:40.442 --> 47:42.778
- Do it anyway.
- OK, be right back.

47:49.159 --> 47:51.662
It's really not necessary, honestly.

48:27.614 --> 48:29.324
Everything seems to be OK.

48:29.408 --> 48:32.202
Thanks, anyway. I appreciate it.

No problem, I didn't do much.

48:35.038 --> 48:37.666
I nearly caught him,
but he took off so fast.

In high school,
I ran the 1,000 meters in 2'42".

shows how scared he was of you.

- Thank you.

Morning, Michèle.

MICHÈLE: I like your sweater.

Do you ski?

50:14.012 --> 50:16.765
Sure. I'll take you anytime.

Kevin?

50:42.207 --> 50:44.126
You shoot, right?

50:44.793 --> 50:46.795
I mean, real shooting.

50:47.254 --> 50:48.755
That's right, I do.

50:49.381 --> 50:51.174
You own guns?

50:52.175 --> 50:53.385
A couple.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.348
Could you teach me?

I could show you, sure.

In real life, he'd run faster.

Kevin, I also wanted to talk to you

an unofficial assignment for you.

51:28.754 --> 51:29.921

51:31.381 --> 51:34.009
I want to know
who created that animation.

Michèle, I want to help,
but that's a major violation.

I'm offering €10,000 cash in hand.

you turn up some weird shit.

Or just poison her.
