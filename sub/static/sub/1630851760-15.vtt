00:51.384 --> 00:53.928
Chief Hong, is your name Hong Du-sik?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.221
What? Yes, it is.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.974
Did you perhaps work
at YK Asset Management?

01:03.938 --> 01:05.356
Do you know Kim Gi-hun?

01:07.817 --> 01:09.110
You know my dad, don't you?

01:10.445 --> 01:12.655
Hong Du-sik, you bastard!

01:15.450 --> 01:16.451
Chief Hong?

01:16.534 --> 01:17.786
-What?
-What the hell?

01:17.869 --> 01:19.704
You… Hey!

01:20.997 --> 01:23.917
My dad used to be healthy
and hike every day!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.919
But thanks to you, he's paralyzed!

01:26.002 --> 01:28.588
He and I had promised
to climb Mt. Jiri together!

01:29.172 --> 01:30.590
-Do-ha! Stop it!
-You!

01:30.673 --> 01:32.258
-That's enough!
-You bastard!

01:32.342 --> 01:34.052
-Hey, stop it.
-Let me go!

01:34.135 --> 01:36.638
-What's going on?
-I'm going to kill him!

01:36.721 --> 01:39.182
-Let me go!
-No. This isn't right!

01:39.265 --> 01:42.101
He's nothing short of a murderer!

01:42.185 --> 01:45.522
He destroyed my dad's legs
and my entire family!

01:59.202 --> 02:01.663
-Let me go!
-Do-ha!

02:01.746 --> 02:03.873
Hey! Running away again?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.750
So this is where you've been hiding,

02:05.834 --> 02:08.711
pretending to be
innocent and kind-hearted.

02:09.337 --> 02:12.590
My dad's been in a vegetative state
for the past six months!

02:12.674 --> 02:14.467
How do you live with yourself?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.387
-Let me go.
-Do-ha.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.223
-Come here!
-That's enough.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.850
-Let's go inside.
-Let go.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.685
Stop it. Do-ha.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.436
-Come here!
-Stop it.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.688
I said, come here!

02:36.322 --> 02:37.323
Chief Hong.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.412
Don't follow me.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.789
No, I will.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.500
I'm worried about you.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.172
I'm sure there is a misunderstanding--

02:53.256 --> 02:54.340
There isn't.

02:56.134 --> 02:57.051
What?

02:57.719 --> 02:59.220
It's the truth.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.848
Everything you heard is true.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.350
What?

03:04.434 --> 03:08.146
I'm the one who did that
to Do-ha's father.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.192
-I don't believe you.
-That's not all.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.863
I also destroyed
that family in the photo you saw.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.865
I…

03:20.074 --> 03:21.367
killed him.

04:45.743 --> 04:48.413
Hye-jin, are you okay?

04:54.669 --> 04:56.254
No, I'm not.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.925
I can't believe this is happening.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.728
Mi-seon.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.858
I don't know what's going on anymore.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.696
I really don't know.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.824
Mi-seon…

06:28.596 --> 06:30.389
EPISODE 15

06:30.890 --> 06:32.683
CALL CHUNG-HO HARDWARE IF YOU NEED HELP

06:32.767 --> 06:35.269
Excuse me. Is anyone here?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.855
This power strip can take up to 4,000W.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.608
You can plug in many devices,
and it'll still stay on.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.860
Du-sik told me so. One second.

06:43.861 --> 06:44.904
Hello?

06:44.987 --> 06:47.824
Bora Supermarket?
Okay. I'll be right there.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.869
-That'll be 10,000 won. Leave it here.
-Sure.

06:51.953 --> 06:52.954
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.497
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.499
-Goodness.
-Ma'am, can we have

06:56.582 --> 06:58.084
-some pickled radish?
-Sure.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.460
This is Gongjin Korean…

06:59.544 --> 07:02.797
I'm sorry, but we're behind
on the deliveries right now.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.174
I'm so sorry. Goodbye.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.760
Why isn't that bastard Nam-gyu picking up?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.428
-Damn it!
-I'd like to pay.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.180
-Sure. How was it?
-I loved it.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.766
Thank you so much.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.769
Iced cafe mocha, iced vanilla latte,
espresso macchiato…

07:16.853 --> 07:18.104
And what was the last one?

07:18.187 --> 07:20.273
-Einspänner.
-Right. Must you have that?

07:20.356 --> 07:21.732
-Of course.
-I see.

07:21.816 --> 07:25.236
-You can't order the same drinks, right?
-No.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.488
-We have different tastes.
-I was just kidding.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.199
-Sir.
-We're actually closed…

07:30.283 --> 07:32.285
-Forget it. Come in.
-Where are our drinks?

07:32.368 --> 07:35.663
-What did you order? Right.
-Strawberry parfait and chocolate shake.

07:35.746 --> 07:40.334
Gosh. Can you guys please
all have iced Americano instead today?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.462
I'll give you a 500-won discount.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.798
Why do you look so haggard?

07:45.882 --> 07:49.427
I'm getting lots of customers today,
but I have no one to help me.

07:49.510 --> 07:53.556
Don't tell me you're all exhausted
because Chief Hong isn't here to help.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.099
We are,

07:55.183 --> 07:58.102
but there's an even bigger concern.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.188
We're worried about him.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.356
I hope he's doing okay.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.527
I haven't seen him since that day.
I can't reach him either.

08:06.611 --> 08:11.199
Remember what I told you before?
That he might've killed someone--

08:11.282 --> 08:13.201
-Hey.
-Shut up!

08:13.284 --> 08:15.870
-You little--
-How dare you say such a thing!

08:15.953 --> 08:17.455
Watch what you say!

08:17.538 --> 08:21.125
I'm not saying I believe that rumor.
I'm just curious. That's all.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.294
I'm worried too.
After all, he's my friend.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.671
What kind of a friend says such a thing?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.548
Don't you know Du-sik?

08:27.632 --> 08:30.843
I have full trust in him.
He would never do such a thing.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.930
-So do I.
-Exactly. I'm a great judge of character,

08:34.013 --> 08:36.474
and he's never looked suspicious to me.

08:37.099 --> 08:37.975
Don't be absurd.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.478
Now that he's not around,
I miss him terribly.

08:40.561 --> 08:45.024
Look at his face.
He has kind, sentimental eyes.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.360
-And they're so clear.
-Exactly.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.819
-You little bastard.
-What?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.781
Someone's at the hardware store.
I should go.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.990
Bye.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.328
Hello? Yes, of course.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.871
-I should go too.
-Bye.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.123
-Yes, I'm nearby.
-I wish I only sold one drink.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.542
Everyone's panicking.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.336
Everything's chaotic
since Chief Hong isn't around.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.005
I hope he's at least eating well.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.673
<i>Everything you heard is true.</i>

09:50.756 --> 09:54.343
I'm the one who did that
to Do-ha's father.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.309
Dr. Yoon, Ms. Yu Cho-hui is here.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.103
Right. We're going
to extract her wisdom tooth today?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.913
Ji-won. What are you doing here?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.248
Hey, Director Ji.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.667
Hello. I've heard a lot about you.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.127
I see.

10:28.836 --> 10:32.548
You have no time
to be chit-chatting like this.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.758
Why? What's the matter?

10:33.841 --> 10:37.845
The rough cut all vanished.
It's chaotic in there.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.765
What? Why didn't you tell me sooner?

10:43.100 --> 10:43.934
Take care.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.353
Sure.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.738
Which part? What's been deleted?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.948
How much of this did you edit?

10:58.908 --> 10:59.742
Just that much.

11:01.035 --> 11:01.994
What?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.538
The file's safe and sound.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.499
It's too big to vanish anywhere.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.169
Do you have a death wish?

11:10.252 --> 11:11.879
That wasn't funny!

11:12.588 --> 11:13.589
Hey.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.843
I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk
about work with other guys.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.806
-What?
-Just don't do it.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.767
Try not to if you can.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.104
Then can I talk casually with them?
About something else?

11:37.613 --> 11:39.615
Seong-hyeon, may I have a word with you?

11:40.825 --> 11:42.618
Sure. Let's go outside.

11:45.704 --> 11:46.956
You should go.

11:59.593 --> 12:00.928
I'm sorry about that day.

12:01.971 --> 12:05.099
I'm sorry I ruined the after-party.

12:05.975 --> 12:10.271
Don't worry about it. I'm sure you had
your reasons for doing that.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.441
I suddenly saw red. It was wrong of me.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.192
May I ask…

12:17.027 --> 12:18.988
about what happened?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.032
My dad worked

12:22.575 --> 12:26.287
as a security guard at YK Asset Management
until a few years ago.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.746
Yes, hello. It's hot outside…

12:27.830 --> 12:29.665
<i>And Du-sik was a fund manager.</i>

12:29.748 --> 12:30.916
Gosh.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.670
<i>And that bastard convinced him
to invest in a fund he managed.</i>

12:34.753 --> 12:38.340
Call this number,
and they'll explain all about it.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.218
Okay. Thank you.

12:41.802 --> 12:42.678
Goodbye.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.598
<i>Being the naive man he was,</i>

12:46.182 --> 12:49.101
<i>he retrieved his security deposit
and even took out a loan.</i>

12:49.935 --> 12:53.772
<i>Then the Benjamin Holdings incident
occurred a few years back.</i>

12:53.856 --> 12:55.107
Mr. Hong.

12:55.191 --> 13:00.029
<i>Stock prices plummeted worldwide,
and so did his fund.</i>

13:01.113 --> 13:04.033
-<i>He didn't take it very well.</i>
-Dad! What's wrong?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.410
<i>He attempted suicide.</i>

13:08.537 --> 13:10.873
<i>It happened while I was job hunting.</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:14.001
He regained consciousness
soon after I started working here.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.837
Why didn't you tell me about this?

13:18.506 --> 13:19.340
I'm sorry.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.802
Things must've been tough,
but I worked you like a dog.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.514
Not at all. I loved it.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.267
I mean, no one likes all-nighters.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.521
But this thought kept me going.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.941
"This company gave me a miracle.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.609
I'm all that Dad has left."

13:41.862 --> 13:43.239
It must've been rough.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.410
Who would've thought
I'd meet Du-sik there?

13:49.328 --> 13:50.579
We're ill-fated.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.625
My dad wasn't the only one
that bastard had ruined.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.337
I heard Du-sik's boss also died then.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.630
In a car accident.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.393
Hye-jin.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.938
I was hesitant to tell you this

14:16.021 --> 14:18.524
since I didn't want
to make you feel worse.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.610
But I found something.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.045
2016's BEST FUND MANAGER PARK JEONG-U
AND TALENTED FUND MANAGER HONG DU-SIK

14:40.129 --> 14:41.922
<i>I also destroyed that family</i>

14:42.590 --> 14:43.799
<i>in the photo you saw.</i>

14:44.842 --> 14:45.843
I…

14:47.094 --> 14:48.345
killed him.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.506
Seon-a.

15:30.888 --> 15:34.141
Seong-hyeon… My husband…

15:34.224 --> 15:37.102
No…

16:15.182 --> 16:16.600
I-jun, are you home?

16:32.324 --> 16:33.492
Don't kill me!

16:34.493 --> 16:35.786
Gosh.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.329
You startled me.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.791
Don't you think
I'd be more startled than you?

16:40.874 --> 16:43.377
Right. You should've said hi first.

16:43.460 --> 16:48.173
I was going to be sweet
and surprise you with a hug from behind.

16:53.637 --> 16:54.638
Do it.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.848
What?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.767
Do it. The hug.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.980
Do you expect me to do that
after scaring me like this?

17:03.063 --> 17:05.232
Because I will.

17:06.817 --> 17:07.985
Unbelievable.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.989
What were you making?

17:12.072 --> 17:13.741
A snack for I-jun.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.660
I'm making a kimchi pancake with squid.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.495
Do you want some?

17:20.956 --> 17:23.834
Not squid! I prefer meat.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.711
I love meat. I don't like squid.

17:25.794 --> 17:30.174
Meat, yes! Oh, no! Not squid!

17:30.257 --> 17:31.258
Mom.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.511
Dad?

17:39.349 --> 17:40.309
You're home.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.783
I-jun.

17:55.866 --> 17:59.828
Let me explain what you saw earlier.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.541
Mom and Dad have decided
to get back together.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.671
Why would you shock him
by cutting to the chase like that?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.215
I-jun.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.842
Let me explain instead.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.261
A long time ago,

18:16.345 --> 18:20.599
there was a misunderstanding
between me and your mom.

18:20.682 --> 18:24.144
That's why we were living apart
for some time.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.729
But recently,

18:26.313 --> 18:30.776
we reconciled as you can see.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.320
Well… You see…

18:35.405 --> 18:36.490
So what I mean is…

18:36.573 --> 18:38.534
Are you getting remarried?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.580
Sure.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.581
Yes.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.919
How are you so smart?

18:49.002 --> 18:50.504
Because he takes after me.

18:52.506 --> 18:56.176
I understand what you mean
and I respect that.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.473
Can I go play at Bo-ra's?

19:01.557 --> 19:03.851
What about your kimchi pancake?

19:03.934 --> 19:05.519
I'm good. I'm full.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.855
I'll get going then.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.690
Have fun. Watch out for the cars.

19:09.773 --> 19:10.649
I will.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.074
Our son is such a saint.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.952
He also got that from me.
Peace of mind.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.374
Kimchi pancake.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.919
I'm going to have it all.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.508
Gosh.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.391
It's gotten cold.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.459
Hello?

20:10.542 --> 20:12.628
<i>Hye-jin, have you thought about it?</i>

20:12.711 --> 20:13.795
Well…

20:15.088 --> 20:17.174
I haven't made up my mind yet.

20:17.257 --> 20:20.093
<i>What's the matter?
I thought you'd say yes right away.</i>

20:20.677 --> 20:24.181
<i>Most people would die
for this opportunity.</i>

20:24.264 --> 20:25.474
I'm sorry.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.351
<i>I can't give you too much time.</i>

20:27.851 --> 20:29.394
<i>I'll give you a few more days.</i>

20:29.478 --> 20:32.231
Okay. I'll call you.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.523
Bye.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.950
Dr. Yoon, are you in there?

20:43.700 --> 20:44.534
Ms. Kim.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.706
What brings you here?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.208
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

20:52.876 --> 20:58.090
I steamed some corn for you.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.218
Gosh, they look scrumptious.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.511
Thank you.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.264
Please. This is nothing.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.016
How are your teeth?
Are they still bothering you?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.726
Not at all.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.562
After getting the implants,

21:12.646 --> 21:15.857
I've been eating lots of squids.

21:15.941 --> 21:20.070
All the squid in the area
must be in my stomach.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.613
I told you to be careful.

21:22.114 --> 21:26.368
Goodness, you nag
just as much as Du-sik does.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.790
I stopped by his house

21:32.541 --> 21:34.418
before coming here.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.464
I've been bringing him food every day,

21:40.257 --> 21:42.467
but he hasn't touched any of it.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.555
He must be a complete mess.

21:48.181 --> 21:52.561
I've left some corn for him,
but I doubt he'll have any.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.362
-Let's go back.
-Where?

22:02.988 --> 22:03.989
To Gongjin.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.743
We need to take more inserts.
It's too boring.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.412
It looks fine to me.
You're such a perfectionist.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.707
It'll only take a day or two.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.460
I'll go with her. You can stay in Seoul.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.921
That's okay. I'll go instead of her.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.716
I take my job seriously, you know?

22:23.383 --> 22:25.135
Okay, then. Let's go.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.972
It's getting late,
and I-jun is nowhere to be seen.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.684
Let me call Bo-ra.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.690
Hey, Bo-ra.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.443
This is I-jun's dad.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.279
I-jun's at your house, right?

22:44.362 --> 22:47.783
<i>No, he's not. We hung out
in the afternoon and said goodbye.</i>

22:47.866 --> 22:48.909
What?

22:50.118 --> 22:52.204
I-jun didn't go to your house?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.582
Then where did he go?

22:58.085 --> 22:59.086
<i>I-jun!</i>

23:00.170 --> 23:02.589
-I-jun!
-Do you hear me?

23:02.672 --> 23:04.716
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

23:06.218 --> 23:07.969
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

23:08.720 --> 23:09.888
I-jun!

23:09.971 --> 23:11.223
Mr. Chang!

23:11.306 --> 23:14.434
-Hey!
-Where is I-jun?

23:14.518 --> 23:18.146
Yun-gyeong, you should be home resting.
Why are you out here?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.606
I've rested more than enough.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.484
How could I not come here
when I-jun is missing?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.694
I-jun…

23:24.778 --> 23:29.282
Hey, what should we do?
What if something happened to him?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.492
Are you crying?

23:30.575 --> 23:33.370
I don't want to hear it.
We'll find him, so stop crying.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.871
We'll go that way.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.373
-Okay.
-Can you go that way?

23:36.456 --> 23:38.792
-Got it.
-Okay. Let's go.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.418
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

23:40.502 --> 23:41.545
I-jun!

23:41.628 --> 23:43.588
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

23:58.228 --> 23:59.563
I-jun!

24:07.320 --> 24:08.697
I-jun!

24:10.991 --> 24:13.743
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you!

24:13.827 --> 24:15.704
Bo-ra…

24:16.496 --> 24:18.707
Why are you crying? Did someone hit you?

24:19.708 --> 24:21.084
No.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.211
Then did your mom scold you
like my mom did?

24:23.712 --> 24:25.005
No.

24:25.839 --> 24:26.965
You were scolded?

24:27.048 --> 24:28.550
Not today.

24:28.633 --> 24:33.054
She used to say that a grandpa ghost
would kidnap me if I misbehaved.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.140
But it's all a lie.

24:35.223 --> 24:38.435
There's no such thing
as a grandpa ghost or even Santa.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.478
I don't get why grown-ups lie so much.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.023
But guess what?

24:43.857 --> 24:47.736
Ghosts and zombies could exist.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.656
So let's hurry home. Okay? Hurry up.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.951
No. I don't want to go home.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.287
Why? Why not?

24:57.370 --> 24:58.955
Because…

25:00.040 --> 25:02.459
-Because…
-I-jun!

25:03.251 --> 25:04.753
-I-jun!
-I-jun!

25:04.836 --> 25:06.421
-I-jun! Where is he?
-I-jun!

25:06.504 --> 25:07.756
I-jun!

25:07.839 --> 25:09.674
-Bo-ra!
-I-jun! What's going on?

25:09.758 --> 25:11.384
I-jun.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.595
Oh, dear.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.097
What are you doing here, my son?

25:17.140 --> 25:18.850
I looked everywhere for you.

25:18.934 --> 25:22.687
You little brat! You scared me to death!

25:22.771 --> 25:24.689
You almost gave me a heart attack!

25:27.150 --> 25:29.653
What are you doing here?

25:30.403 --> 25:32.322
Are you upset with me?

25:33.073 --> 25:34.449
No.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.995
Then is this because of
what we talked about today?

25:40.789 --> 25:46.086
I-jun, is it
because you feel uncomfortable about us

25:46.795 --> 25:48.546
living together again?

25:49.547 --> 25:50.757
No.

25:52.801 --> 25:53.885
I like it.

25:54.594 --> 25:58.974
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.108
But I didn't want you

26:09.943 --> 26:12.988
to see me cry
because you'd be heartbroken.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.118
You brat.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.288
Is that why you were crying alone here?

26:21.371 --> 26:22.539
Yes.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.878
I-jun, you're only nine years old.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.049
You should think about yourself first

26:33.133 --> 26:35.802
instead of worrying about our feelings.

26:36.511 --> 26:37.345
She's right.

26:39.222 --> 26:43.435
You're too young to think like an adult.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.603
Don't grow up too fast.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.897
Just act your age. You can do that.

26:53.653 --> 26:57.032
To tell you the truth,

26:58.908 --> 27:00.910
even if it wasn't my birthday

27:02.537 --> 27:05.332
or I didn't win a school award,

27:06.458 --> 27:11.004
I wanted to eat together as a family.

27:11.796 --> 27:17.052
I've always wanted us to live
under the same roof.

27:22.098 --> 27:22.932
I'm sorry.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.603
I had no idea.

27:28.396 --> 27:32.692
I'm sorry
I didn't understand how you felt, I-jun.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.698
I'm sorry.

27:39.574 --> 27:40.575
I-jun.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.287
Let's go home.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.331
And

27:47.374 --> 27:49.793
let's have dinner together.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.344
-Bo-ra.
-What?

27:59.427 --> 28:01.012
Why are you crying?

28:01.096 --> 28:02.555
-Why? Gosh.
-What's wrong?

28:02.639 --> 28:04.224
-Mom. Dad.
-Yes?

28:04.307 --> 28:08.144
I'm going to eat with I-jun
every single day!

28:08.228 --> 28:11.689
I'm going to live with him!

28:11.773 --> 28:14.776
I'm going to make sure
he doesn't feel lonely anymore!

28:14.859 --> 28:19.572
But Bo-ra, we should ask him
how he feels about that first and--

28:20.657 --> 28:22.283
I-jun…

28:23.576 --> 28:26.788
I'm sorry I didn't know how you felt.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.379
I'm sorry.

28:38.466 --> 28:40.427
Let's go eat, I-jun.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.591
Did you know Ms. Kim left
some corn for you?

29:21.801 --> 29:23.970
I had some, and it was tasty.

29:25.346 --> 29:27.599
Gangwon Province has the best corn.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.730
Haven't you eaten?

29:35.398 --> 29:36.649
Why do you look so gaunt?

29:43.114 --> 29:45.408
I can still give you some time.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.077
I can wait.

29:49.078 --> 29:52.999
So for today,
I'll cook you something and leave.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.086
No. At least let me see you
have your first bite.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.633
I have something to tell you.

30:03.092 --> 30:04.260
Remember

30:05.595 --> 30:07.972
I told you I had something to tell you?

30:15.772 --> 30:17.941
I had a friend.

30:19.692 --> 30:21.361
His name was Park Jeong-u.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.658
We became college roommates

30:27.158 --> 30:28.743
when I was a freshman

30:29.911 --> 30:31.788
and he was a returning student.

30:34.874 --> 30:38.962
We automatically became close
since we lived together.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.799
We'd drink together every day.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.802
Get over our hangover and drink again.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.098
We'd hold

30:51.224 --> 30:53.101
my grandpa's memorial service together.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.148
Thanks to him, I realized,

31:00.358 --> 31:01.442
"Gosh.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.988
So this must be how it feels…

31:10.869 --> 31:12.787
to have an older brother."

31:16.624 --> 31:19.043
He convinced me to work at that company.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.005
He was a fund manager there.

31:23.715 --> 31:26.676
At first, I was hesitant
about taking the job.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.679
It had nothing to do with my major

31:30.471 --> 31:32.432
and was too money-oriented.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.726
I didn't like that.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.397
But then he said,

31:40.481 --> 31:42.066
"Fund managers

31:43.192 --> 31:45.111
give ordinary people

31:46.195 --> 31:50.158
hope that even they can become rich."

31:53.578 --> 31:54.579
I think…

31:56.831 --> 31:59.000
that made me change my mind.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.592
<i>At first, it was quite fun.</i>

32:08.384 --> 32:11.512
<i>It suited me, and I made a lot of money.</i>

32:12.680 --> 32:16.184
<i>-I got to meet many new people.</i>
-Judging by the information,

32:16.267 --> 32:18.436
I believe it's quite promising.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.941
<i>That's where I met Do-ha's father.</i>

32:23.942 --> 32:25.360
Hello.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.362
<i>I greeted him every day.</i>

32:29.113 --> 32:31.783
-Have a great day.
<i>-I treated him like a Gongjin neighbor.</i>

32:32.408 --> 32:33.868
<i>And we became close soon.</i>

32:34.869 --> 32:35.828
<i>Then one day,</i>

32:37.205 --> 32:39.248
<i>he told me he wanted
to subscribe to my fund.</i>

32:39.332 --> 32:40.750
Hello, sir.

32:40.833 --> 32:42.627
<i>The trust funds I was managing</i>

32:44.003 --> 32:45.755
<i>had high returns.</i>

32:46.714 --> 32:50.301
<i>But due to the high risk,
I dissuaded him at first.</i>

32:51.219 --> 32:53.513
<i>-However,</i>
-Call this number…

32:53.596 --> 32:55.598
<i>he was very adamant.</i>

32:56.265 --> 32:58.017
Okay. Thank you.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.938
But sir, you should never be reckless.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.147
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay?

33:03.231 --> 33:05.858
-Okay.
-All right. See you.

33:06.442 --> 33:08.695
Thank you, Mr. Hong. Thank you.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.740
Then…

33:13.866 --> 33:15.118
something happened.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.252
This is YK Asset Management.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.254
-Yes?
-Hello. No, let me explain.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.599
<i>Korea is suffering from the aftermath</i>

33:38.683 --> 33:41.144
<i>of Benjamin Holdings' bankruptcy.</i>

33:41.227 --> 33:44.731
<i>The stock markets have plummeted,
and the exchange rates are soaring.</i>

33:45.231 --> 33:46.858
<i>When the stock markets opened,</i>

33:46.941 --> 33:49.318
-Mr. Hong.
<i>-KOSPI went down by 8.4 percent,</i>

33:49.402 --> 33:52.405
<i>and KOSDAQ went down by almost 12 percent,</i>

33:52.488 --> 33:55.533
<i>-the lowest rate in the past 12 years.</i>
-Sir.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.787
What?

34:00.371 --> 34:04.208
I didn't recommend ELF to you,
so why did you subscribe to that?

34:04.292 --> 34:08.755
Since I didn't know much about it,
I trusted the employee.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.215
I should've checked right away.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.927
What should I do?
I heard that it's minus 70 percent.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.930
Due to the knock-in,
you're likely to lose your principal.

34:19.682 --> 34:22.185
But once the dust settles,

34:22.268 --> 34:24.103
it'll all be recovered in time.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.272
So don't be hasty and resale it.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.025
But you see,

34:30.568 --> 34:33.613
-I used my security deposit for my house.
-What?

34:33.696 --> 34:37.909
And I even took out a loan.
My family doesn't know about it.

34:38.659 --> 34:41.537
I told you not to be reckless.
Why did you do that?

34:41.621 --> 34:43.456
I don't know.

34:43.539 --> 34:47.710
I must've been crazy or greedy for money.

34:48.544 --> 34:51.964
I just wanted my wife to live
in a house with warm running water.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.593
I wanted to pay for my son's student loans

34:56.344 --> 34:59.847
and buy him a nice suit
for his job interview.

35:00.556 --> 35:01.974
Sir, just trust me…

35:04.268 --> 35:06.062
Sir, just trust me and wait.

35:06.145 --> 35:08.689
Let me take care of this
and get back to you, okay?

35:09.524 --> 35:11.067
I'll give you a call, sir. Hey.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.027
Okay.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.279
What an idiot!

35:26.749 --> 35:28.459
GI-HUN

35:33.673 --> 35:36.968
GI-HUN

35:41.681 --> 35:45.351
GI-HUN

35:54.569 --> 35:56.654
Du-sik, drink this.

35:56.737 --> 35:57.780
Thanks.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.033
We've been at it for days.

36:01.117 --> 36:04.203
Jeong-u, when do you think
things will start looking up?

36:04.287 --> 36:06.372
More companies might go bankrupt.

36:06.914 --> 36:10.042
We don't know what sort of factors
could surface again.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.377
So let's wait it out.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.964
Mr. Park. Mr. Hong. Have you heard?

36:15.047 --> 36:16.007
About what?

36:16.591 --> 36:18.926
Our company's security guard
attempted suicide.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.469
What?

36:34.317 --> 36:35.693
Damn it.

36:46.579 --> 36:47.538
Get out.

36:49.123 --> 36:51.125
-Get out.
-I need to go.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.044
I… I need to go.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.754
I said, get out!

36:57.798 --> 36:59.091
I'll drive.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.177
You shouldn't drive right now. Get out.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.056
Come out.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.981
It's okay.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.482
It'll be okay.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.734
I'm sure he'll be okay.

37:58.818 --> 38:01.737
Had I explained better to him…

38:02.321 --> 38:03.155
No.

38:04.657 --> 38:07.034
I should've picked up his calls.

38:08.911 --> 38:09.954
It's my fault.

38:10.705 --> 38:11.998
I'm to blame.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.084
No, it's not.

38:15.167 --> 38:17.211
And even if that's the case,

38:17.295 --> 38:19.714
I'll carry the blame with you. So Du-sik,

38:20.631 --> 38:22.842
let's just pray that he's okay.

39:25.654 --> 39:26.655
Jeong-u.

39:30.242 --> 39:31.243
Jeong-u…

39:38.084 --> 39:39.460
Jeong-u…

39:45.049 --> 39:46.258
Jeong-u…

39:50.471 --> 39:54.475
Jeong-u!

40:23.337 --> 40:26.465
Jeong-u!

40:32.972 --> 40:35.641
Jeong-u!

40:52.158 --> 40:54.034
You can cry if you want.

40:54.827 --> 40:57.288
It must've been so hard for you.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.709
You must've hidden the pain deep down.

41:03.335 --> 41:06.255
You've been holding onto such a burden.

41:07.173 --> 41:11.510
You can be sad when you're with me.

41:16.724 --> 41:20.519
You can show me your pain.

41:21.937 --> 41:23.022
You can cry.

41:24.648 --> 41:25.774
You can.

41:59.683 --> 42:03.062
Do you remember that Gongjin
wasn't our original destination?

42:04.355 --> 42:07.441
I do. Was it Sejin Harbor?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.360
We were waiting for you there,

42:09.443 --> 42:12.655
but you took the wrong way
and ended up in Gongjin.

42:12.738 --> 42:14.532
That's when I'd just gotten this car.

42:14.615 --> 42:17.826
I was just trying this baby
on the expressway, you know.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.412
You're ridiculous. Jeez.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.333
Had I not gone there,

42:25.292 --> 42:27.670
you wouldn't have had to meet Du-sik.

42:31.674 --> 42:36.720
But I can't help but think
that we were meant to end up in Gongjin.

42:37.763 --> 42:39.014
I didn't know,

42:40.140 --> 42:41.725
but I was also involved in it.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.730
Du-sik's boss who died in the car accident

42:47.314 --> 42:48.649
was my brother-in-law.

42:49.650 --> 42:50.693
What?

42:52.278 --> 42:55.322
So how can I possibly not believe in fate?

42:59.827 --> 43:00.911
So…

43:00.995 --> 43:04.748
I may not be able
to empathize with you completely

43:05.291 --> 43:07.543
since I'm not directly related to this.

43:09.128 --> 43:13.549
But I don't think
it's been easy for Chief Hong either.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.012
When the car accident occurred,

43:19.805 --> 43:21.890
he was on his way to see your father.

43:26.312 --> 43:30.065
What a stroke of bad luck for everyone.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.499
Hwa-jeong.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.961
Cho-hui. What brings you here?

43:51.962 --> 43:53.213
Are you here to see me?

43:53.297 --> 43:56.091
That too. I'm also here
to buy some porridge.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.010
Why? Are you sick?

43:58.093 --> 44:00.888
No. I had my wisdom tooth
pulled out a few days ago.

44:00.971 --> 44:03.891
Gosh, it must've been painful.
Are you okay?

44:03.974 --> 44:07.269
I was scared to do it,
but now that it's gone, I feel relieved.

44:07.353 --> 44:10.648
It's best you pull it out.
If not, the pain will just worsen.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.080
Here you go.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.791
Thank you.

44:28.874 --> 44:30.876
I'll pay on my way out.

44:31.502 --> 44:34.630
It's on me, in return
for the eye cream you gave me.

44:35.255 --> 44:37.966
-Though it must've been pricier.
-Have you been using it?

44:38.050 --> 44:40.386
You bet. I use it twice a day.

44:40.469 --> 44:43.138
-It's nice and moisturizing.
-I'm glad.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.140
I'll look young thanks to you.

44:45.224 --> 44:47.518
You're still just as young and pretty.

44:48.102 --> 44:50.145
You look exactly
like you did 15 years ago.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.897
That can't be.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.399
I'm serious.

44:55.025 --> 44:57.236
You look the same as when I first met you.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.406
Hwa-jeong.

45:01.281 --> 45:03.700
Nothing was going on
between Yeong-guk and me.

45:04.576 --> 45:07.830
Not then, not now.

45:09.331 --> 45:12.000
He's not the person I had a crush on.

45:17.756 --> 45:18.799
You…

45:21.760 --> 45:23.262
were the one.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.275
Did you know that?

45:40.654 --> 45:42.823
How did you know?

45:43.824 --> 45:48.078
I just did.
I don't know how, but I could feel it.

45:48.954 --> 45:52.833
It's never easy to hide
your feelings for someone.

45:54.209 --> 45:56.336
You were so gorgeous,

45:56.420 --> 46:00.591
kind-hearted, friendly, and polite.

46:00.674 --> 46:04.386
Being an elementary school teacher
was your calling since you loved kids.

46:04.470 --> 46:07.973
But despite all of that,
you looked so lonely.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.933
I wanted to take care of you.

46:10.809 --> 46:14.980
Although I couldn't reciprocate
your feelings the same way,

46:16.148 --> 46:18.400
I liked you back then as well.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.570
And I still do.

46:25.741 --> 46:29.703
Thank you.
For pretending not to know all this time.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.998
And for accepting me for who I am.

46:34.791 --> 46:36.668
But I've changed.

46:37.419 --> 46:40.631
You see, I've given you up
a long time ago.

46:41.507 --> 46:43.592
I don't have
those feelings for you anymore.

46:44.468 --> 46:48.972
All that I want is for you and Yeong-guk
to be happy together.

46:50.015 --> 46:52.935
I can't say I've found that happiness yet.

46:54.353 --> 46:58.273
But I do think
I'm somewhere in the ballpark.

46:59.024 --> 47:01.985
Good. That's all I want for you.

47:24.091 --> 47:26.385
You should go. I got this.

47:27.678 --> 47:28.595
What?

47:29.221 --> 47:31.723
You have a hangnail that's bothering you.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.768
It's painful and irritating.

47:39.064 --> 47:43.735
You need to take care of it.
If not, it'll hurt even more.

48:14.016 --> 48:15.934
I wondered millions of times

48:16.518 --> 48:19.271
what kind of life you were living.

48:19.771 --> 48:21.815
In my head,

48:22.482 --> 48:24.234
you were still shameless

48:25.694 --> 48:27.946
continuing to cause harm to others.

48:29.573 --> 48:30.616
I'm sorry.

48:31.783 --> 48:32.826
I mean it.

48:34.244 --> 48:35.996
I always found it odd.

48:37.372 --> 48:38.999
After what happened,

48:39.625 --> 48:42.669
I expected my family to become dirt poor.

48:44.171 --> 48:45.589
But we moved

48:46.548 --> 48:47.633
to an apartment.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.385
One day, my mom told me

48:51.470 --> 48:53.430
that I should only focus on getting a job

48:53.513 --> 48:55.766
since my student loan
was already taken care of.

48:57.434 --> 48:59.603
And not to worry
about Dad's hospital bills.

49:01.605 --> 49:03.899
She said it was thanks
to the insurance payout,

49:05.108 --> 49:06.693
but it didn't make any sense.

49:07.402 --> 49:09.321
I knew how poor we were to begin with.

49:10.781 --> 49:11.990
Was it you?

49:25.545 --> 49:26.922
What is this?

49:27.005 --> 49:30.509
I sold everything I had.

49:33.512 --> 49:34.721
I'm sorry.

49:36.473 --> 49:39.393
But this is the only way
I can try to make up

49:40.936 --> 49:42.771
for what happened to him.

49:42.854 --> 49:44.314
Is this how

49:45.899 --> 49:48.485
smart and wealthy people
take responsibility?

49:54.825 --> 49:56.910
You can think however you like.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.205
But please accept it.

50:02.874 --> 50:04.835
I beg you.

50:08.338 --> 50:12.175
I believe he'll wake up.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.011
I have no other intentions.

50:15.595 --> 50:17.681
I just want to help you hold out

50:18.223 --> 50:20.642
until he regains consciousness.

50:28.191 --> 50:30.193
You disgust me.

50:38.577 --> 50:41.079
It's terrifying how much power money has.

50:43.790 --> 50:46.626
I ought to rip it to shreds right now.

50:47.878 --> 50:48.962
But I'll take this.

50:50.172 --> 50:52.382
I'm going to pay off our debts…

50:54.301 --> 50:56.970
and move him to a better hospital.

51:03.935 --> 51:06.396
So don't you dare go back on your word!

51:09.065 --> 51:10.025
I won't.

51:18.408 --> 51:19.743
<i>So it was you.</i>

51:20.994 --> 51:23.789
<i>Did you think
money would solve everything?</i>

51:24.748 --> 51:26.666
Did you think we'd happily take it

51:28.543 --> 51:30.212
since we were dirt poor?

51:30.295 --> 51:32.172
No. That's not why.

51:32.255 --> 51:34.174
Then what was it?

51:35.634 --> 51:36.635
Did you pity us?

51:36.718 --> 51:39.221
The last thing
your father and I talked about

51:40.347 --> 51:41.515
was his family.

51:42.808 --> 51:44.351
I couldn't forget

51:44.434 --> 51:46.937
how he wanted to buy you a nice suit

51:47.979 --> 51:49.231
for your job interview.

51:51.191 --> 51:53.693
So I wanted to help him with it at least.

51:59.032 --> 52:00.659
So it was all because of me.

52:01.576 --> 52:03.161
My dad was never greedy,

52:03.245 --> 52:05.747
so I couldn't understand
why he had done such a thing.

52:06.331 --> 52:09.417
I used to have a hard time landing a job
and would come home drunk.

52:10.669 --> 52:12.420
He blamed my old suit.

52:13.338 --> 52:14.589
He said I looked poor.

52:16.258 --> 52:17.759
He said

52:19.052 --> 52:22.848
I couldn't get a job because I had
neither money nor connections.

52:22.931 --> 52:28.019
That's not true.
He was always proud of you.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.565
He'd brag about how his son was smart

52:31.648 --> 52:33.775
and graduated
from a prestigious university.

52:36.611 --> 52:38.238
And I just remembered that now.

52:43.451 --> 52:44.536
I'm to blame.

52:46.496 --> 52:48.915
I failed to grab his hand
when he reached out to me.

52:50.792 --> 52:51.793
No.

52:52.961 --> 52:55.881
It's not your fault. I know it's not.

52:58.049 --> 53:00.844
I just needed someone to blame.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.975
My dad didn't even go to high school.

53:08.143 --> 53:12.731
If you guys were close, why didn't you pay
a bit more attention to him?

53:13.231 --> 53:16.568
Why couldn't you have told him
once more that everything would be okay?

53:25.660 --> 53:26.661
I'm sorry.

53:29.456 --> 53:30.874
I'm really sorry.

53:31.875 --> 53:34.502
I am. I'm sorry.

54:03.031 --> 54:05.033
Jeong-u will be happy
to see you dressed up.

54:05.116 --> 54:08.578
This is the suit he bought me
for my job interview.

54:09.663 --> 54:11.081
What a precious suit.

54:11.665 --> 54:12.916
He'll love it.

54:15.085 --> 54:16.711
Yongin, was it?

54:17.462 --> 54:18.630
Yes.

54:45.115 --> 54:48.535
Ha-rang, do you remember that uncle?

54:48.618 --> 54:51.496
What? He's not my uncle.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.416
He's not Uncle Seong-hyeon.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.043
He is your uncle.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.213
He's Uncle Du-sik.

55:01.881 --> 55:05.051
When you were a baby,

55:05.135 --> 55:08.680
he'd always hold you and dote on you.

55:12.308 --> 55:15.729
Run over to him. Be brave

55:15.812 --> 55:18.148
and say hello to him.

55:19.399 --> 55:21.860
Hello, Uncle.

55:31.327 --> 55:32.704
Hi, Ha-rang.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.081
It's been a long time.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.377
Do you still like dinosaurs?

55:39.461 --> 55:44.215
I do. I like Eustreptospondylus,

55:44.299 --> 55:49.012
Pachycephalosaurus, and Stegosaurus.

55:55.852 --> 55:58.104
Why are you crying?

55:58.688 --> 55:59.856
I'm just proud

56:00.565 --> 56:03.818
that you know
such difficult dinosaur names.

56:30.303 --> 56:32.639
Auntie, don't I have so many?

56:32.722 --> 56:36.392
Gosh. What is this?
Did you find this, Ha-rang?

56:36.476 --> 56:39.270
-I did. I found it near the water.
-Near the water?

56:39.354 --> 56:41.815
Let's pile them up. Let's see.

56:41.898 --> 56:43.858
-Should we make a cake with these?
-Okay.

56:43.942 --> 56:47.695
Did you find this one too? It's so pretty.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.906
Doesn't he take after Jeong-u a lot?

56:49.989 --> 56:52.158
-Yes.
-He even acts like him.

56:54.035 --> 56:56.496
He also sleeps
with his arms above his head.

56:58.623 --> 57:00.291
He hates carrots.

57:00.375 --> 57:02.919
He also has many friends.

57:03.962 --> 57:05.547
And he's surprisingly stubborn.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.758
He really is the same as Jeong-u.

57:09.592 --> 57:10.718
I'm telling you.

57:13.138 --> 57:16.432
I heard from Seong-hyeon
that you were here.

57:16.516 --> 57:17.767
"Seong-hyeon"?

57:19.060 --> 57:20.228
Do you mean Director Ji?

57:20.311 --> 57:25.108
Yes. We're cousins.
He said you guys are pretty close.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.028
What a small world, right?

57:30.363 --> 57:34.159
I had no idea you came here
after disappearing like that.

57:38.288 --> 57:39.289
Du-sik.

57:41.291 --> 57:44.002
I won't apologize

57:45.920 --> 57:47.672
for what I did back then.

57:49.507 --> 57:53.386
Back then, I'd lost the will to live.

57:55.054 --> 57:58.475
I didn't even want to breathe
in a world without Jeong-u.

58:01.394 --> 58:02.270
But you know what?

58:04.272 --> 58:05.607
I could.

58:07.609 --> 58:11.571
I was able to breathe, eat, and drink.

58:11.654 --> 58:15.617
At times, I'd even smile
at Ha-rang's silly face.

58:17.368 --> 58:18.870
And after some time,

58:20.955 --> 58:22.332
I regained the will to live.

58:28.630 --> 58:29.631
Du-sik.

58:33.176 --> 58:34.344
I don't

58:35.220 --> 58:38.848
resent you anymore.

58:39.849 --> 58:43.561
So find it in your heart

58:45.146 --> 58:47.106
to forgive yourself as well.

58:58.243 --> 59:04.374
Mom! Auntie and I made a cake together!

59:05.917 --> 59:09.295
Mom, come here! Hurry up!

59:09.379 --> 59:13.174
Really? You must be so proud!

59:19.597 --> 59:22.725
We just built it, but where did it go?

59:22.809 --> 59:24.477
-Your mom's here.
-Who made this?

59:24.561 --> 59:25.979
Did Auntie make it for you?

59:35.780 --> 59:36.906
Are you crying?

59:40.827 --> 59:44.080
Gosh, you've become a crybaby.

59:48.543 --> 59:49.544
Jeong-u.

59:50.044 --> 59:52.714
See? You become more emotional as you age.

59:53.381 --> 59:56.259
I remember how you teased me
about bawling so much

59:56.342 --> 59:57.719
when Ha-rang was born.

59:58.970 --> 1:00:00.888
He sure has grown a lot.

1:00:12.859 --> 1:00:13.860
Jeong-u.

1:00:15.987 --> 1:00:18.531
I've missed you so much.

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:21.701
Me too.

1:00:23.036 --> 1:00:24.037
I'm sorry.

1:00:27.165 --> 1:00:28.750
Because of me--

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:29.667
Du-sik.

1:00:31.377 --> 1:00:32.879
Remember what I said back then?

1:00:33.838 --> 1:00:35.298
It's not your fault.

1:00:39.719 --> 1:00:40.720
Still.

1:00:42.597 --> 1:00:43.556
I'm sorry.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:44.682
It's okay.

1:00:45.892 --> 1:00:47.060
It's all right.

1:00:48.853 --> 1:00:50.271
You survived.

1:00:53.107 --> 1:00:54.275
So Du-sik,

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:57.987
carry on with your life.

1:00:59.364 --> 1:01:01.324
Not for me, but for yourself.

1:01:02.992 --> 1:01:06.245
See and do everything you want to
until you're fed up.

1:01:08.873 --> 1:01:11.668
Once you've done everything
you've ever wanted to do,

1:01:13.544 --> 1:01:14.921
then we can meet again.

1:01:18.257 --> 1:01:19.258
Jeong-u.

1:01:22.011 --> 1:01:23.179
And when we meet again,

1:01:25.973 --> 1:01:27.725
let's go fishing.

1:01:30.728 --> 1:01:31.938
Okay, brother?

1:02:30.997 --> 1:02:31.998
Goodness.

1:02:48.264 --> 1:02:51.601
Gam-ri, are you having a pity party?
Why are you cleaning all alone?

1:02:51.684 --> 1:02:53.853
You should sweep before wiping.

1:02:53.936 --> 1:02:58.274
You're so noisy.
Why are you here? You should go home.

1:02:58.357 --> 1:03:01.694
The swarm of people has left you behind,

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:03.821
so we came to keep you company.

1:03:03.905 --> 1:03:06.866
Let's clean then have dinner together.

1:03:06.949 --> 1:03:11.120
Better yet, should we have a sleepover?

1:03:11.204 --> 1:03:14.582
What? Don't be such a nuisance.

1:03:14.665 --> 1:03:17.001
Good idea. Suk-ja, sweep that side.

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:17.919
Okay.

1:03:19.253 --> 1:03:24.383
<i>Arirang, arirang, arariyo</i>

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:30.139
-Hey.
-<i>Passing over the Arirang Pass</i>

1:03:42.068 --> 1:03:44.737
Ha-rang seems to really like you.

1:03:47.114 --> 1:03:50.117
He wants us to visit him next time.

1:03:52.328 --> 1:03:54.413
We were supposed to visit your friend,

1:03:55.081 --> 1:03:56.749
but we couldn't make it there.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:57.917
It's okay.

1:03:59.877 --> 1:04:01.212
I'm sure he'll understand.

1:04:04.757 --> 1:04:06.050
It's good to see you smile.

1:04:08.302 --> 1:04:09.971
Keep smiling.

1:04:10.054 --> 1:04:11.889
Don't think twice about whether or not

1:04:12.390 --> 1:04:14.183
you should smile or be happy.

1:04:15.351 --> 1:04:17.353
Don't think too much.

1:04:18.312 --> 1:04:19.522
Just smile.

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:24.777
Hye-jin.

1:04:25.903 --> 1:04:26.904
Yes?

1:04:30.825 --> 1:04:33.119
To tell the truth,
I was going to kill myself.

1:04:37.874 --> 1:04:39.458
When I heard

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:42.795
that Jeong-u had passed away,

1:04:44.088 --> 1:04:46.048
I rushed out of the hospital.

1:05:01.522 --> 1:05:05.359
<i>I kept walking and found myself
on one of the Han River bridges.</i>

1:05:07.069 --> 1:05:08.571
<i>That's when I thought,</i>

1:05:10.865 --> 1:05:12.533
<i>"I should just end my life.</i>

1:05:15.536 --> 1:05:18.998
<i>Wouldn't this river eventually take me</i>

1:05:19.498 --> 1:05:20.708
<i>to the sea?</i>

1:05:22.168 --> 1:05:23.252
<i>Then</i>

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:26.714
<i>would I be able to see my parents again?"</i>

1:05:36.432 --> 1:05:37.433
Darn.

1:05:40.227 --> 1:05:41.729
MS. GAM-RI

1:05:48.653 --> 1:05:53.407
<i>Du-sik, I'm in Seoul right now.
Can I see you?</i>

1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:57.203
<i>I brought your favorite side dishes.</i>

1:05:57.286 --> 1:05:59.413
<i>I've practically forgotten
what you look like.</i>

1:05:59.497 --> 1:06:01.832
<i>I miss you a lot.</i>

1:06:07.338 --> 1:06:09.090
<i>What great timing.</i>

1:06:11.300 --> 1:06:13.844
<i>My life was so busy
that I had no time for her.</i>

1:06:14.595 --> 1:06:16.514
<i>Actually, I had forgotten about her.</i>

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:22.436
<i>But that text message
filled with countless typos</i>

1:06:23.854 --> 1:06:25.189
<i>saved me.</i>

1:06:28.109 --> 1:06:29.986
<i>I had decided to kill myself that day.</i>

1:06:30.945 --> 1:06:34.073
<i>But Ms. Gam-ri and Gongjin</i>

1:06:35.199 --> 1:06:36.450
<i>saved me.</i>

1:06:58.931 --> 1:07:00.558
<i>That's why I came back.</i>

1:07:01.726 --> 1:07:03.269
<i>I didn't kill myself,</i>

1:07:04.353 --> 1:07:06.564
<i>but I didn't know how to carry on either.</i>

1:07:13.446 --> 1:07:17.283
<i>I locked myself in that dark house.</i>

1:07:21.287 --> 1:07:23.330
But people kept knocking on my door.

1:07:24.999 --> 1:07:27.084
They didn't ask any questions.

1:07:28.002 --> 1:07:31.213
They just brought food and checked on me.

1:07:32.715 --> 1:07:33.716
It was as if

1:07:34.717 --> 1:07:36.927
they were taking care of a stray cat.

1:07:38.471 --> 1:07:40.723
They were indifferent yet warm to me.

1:07:43.517 --> 1:07:46.854
Then one day,
they started asking me for help.

1:07:48.647 --> 1:07:52.401
"The light bulb in my bathroom burned out.
My washing machine broke.

1:07:53.986 --> 1:07:56.197
Can you fill in for me while I'm gone?"

1:07:58.949 --> 1:08:00.409
I bet it was intentional.

1:08:05.081 --> 1:08:07.541
So that's how you became Chief Hong.

1:08:14.673 --> 1:08:15.758
You're right.

1:08:17.718 --> 1:08:19.637
Gongjin saved you.

1:08:23.265 --> 1:08:24.517
I finally get it.

1:08:25.226 --> 1:08:28.979
I understand why you love Gongjin so much.

1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:31.982
Why you feel so attached

1:08:33.192 --> 1:08:37.154
to this small seaside town that seems

1:08:38.489 --> 1:08:40.991
nothing out of the ordinary.

1:08:42.368 --> 1:08:45.830
So that's the end of my story.

1:08:47.039 --> 1:08:48.791
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:51.377
Thank you.

1:08:53.796 --> 1:08:55.840
I was worried you'd never open up.

1:08:56.632 --> 1:08:58.968
So thank you for mustering up the courage.

1:08:59.051 --> 1:09:01.804
It's all thanks to you.
I would've never opened up otherwise.

1:09:04.682 --> 1:09:08.018
Right. Didn't you say
you had something to tell me that day too?

1:09:08.102 --> 1:09:10.855
Right. You see…

1:09:11.522 --> 1:09:13.524
Don't tell me now if you're not ready.

1:09:14.108 --> 1:09:16.569
This time, I'll wait for you.

1:09:17.111 --> 1:09:18.654
Like you did for me.

1:09:20.823 --> 1:09:22.074
Actually,

1:09:25.077 --> 1:09:27.413
I was offered a clinical professor job.

1:09:30.499 --> 1:09:32.501
In Seoul, I suppose.

1:09:52.813 --> 1:09:55.065
Guys, are you already asleep?

1:09:55.941 --> 1:09:59.778
My eyelids feel so heavy right now.

1:10:00.279 --> 1:10:03.574
I get too sleepy
to even catch up on my soap operas lately.

1:10:03.657 --> 1:10:05.743
That's because we're old

1:10:05.826 --> 1:10:08.746
and get sleepy early in the evening.

1:10:08.829 --> 1:10:09.955
That's true.

1:10:10.789 --> 1:10:14.919
I can't believe I'm over 70.

1:10:15.002 --> 1:10:19.673
I still feel like a young girl who used
to sneak around with her boyfriend.

1:10:19.757 --> 1:10:24.762
Gosh, get your mind out of the gutter.
You better watch what you say.

1:10:24.845 --> 1:10:28.098
What is it? Did you never sneak around
with your boyfriend?

1:10:28.182 --> 1:10:29.099
What did you say?

1:10:29.892 --> 1:10:33.020
There's no place
we didn't sneak into back in the day.

1:10:33.103 --> 1:10:35.773
Gosh, enough with that nonsense.

1:10:35.856 --> 1:10:38.067
Just go to sleep, will you?

1:10:38.859 --> 1:10:39.860
Gosh.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:49.411
By the way, do you guys feel this way too?

1:10:50.079 --> 1:10:51.789
I feel sad

1:10:52.373 --> 1:10:55.292
that my body is aging
while my heart is still young.

1:10:55.376 --> 1:10:56.877
I feel that way all the time.

1:10:58.629 --> 1:11:02.216
Both my tongue and mind became dull.

1:11:02.967 --> 1:11:05.177
I became clumsy.

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:07.096
Time indeed flies.

1:11:07.972 --> 1:11:10.975
Gam-ri, how about you?

1:11:11.642 --> 1:11:14.353
Of course, I've felt that way.

1:11:15.354 --> 1:11:20.401
But you see, I like that I'm old.

1:11:21.485 --> 1:11:23.612
How could you possibly like being old?

1:11:24.196 --> 1:11:28.575
Looking back, I've had many tasty dishes,

1:11:29.159 --> 1:11:32.246
seen great scenery,

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:35.666
and met wonderful people.

1:11:37.543 --> 1:11:39.962
What more could I ask for?

1:11:40.671 --> 1:11:42.798
Are you happy?

1:11:42.881 --> 1:11:45.467
Of course. I'm happy.

1:11:46.844 --> 1:11:50.347
I appeared on a TV show

1:11:50.931 --> 1:11:54.518
and even sang on stage.

1:11:55.352 --> 1:11:58.605
And right now, I'm chatting with you guys.

1:11:58.689 --> 1:12:01.191
My life is so fun.

1:12:05.237 --> 1:12:06.655
That's not all.

1:12:08.615 --> 1:12:09.825
Today,

1:12:11.201 --> 1:12:14.371
the evening glow looked so beautiful.

1:12:15.664 --> 1:12:19.877
The squid I had for dinner
was scrumptious too.

1:12:22.421 --> 1:12:25.382
Look around yourself closely,

1:12:25.466 --> 1:12:29.303
and you'll realize that you're surrounded
by many precious things.

1:12:34.266 --> 1:12:35.559
Every day…

1:12:38.145 --> 1:12:40.064
is full of so much excitement

1:12:41.482 --> 1:12:45.319
as if I'm going on a picnic the next day.

1:12:47.279 --> 1:12:49.031
Picnics sound lovely.

1:12:49.114 --> 1:12:52.451
Gam-ri, what should we do tomorrow?

1:12:53.660 --> 1:12:57.873
As the youngest among us,
you should come up with something.

1:12:57.956 --> 1:12:59.875
You always say that when you're lazy.

1:13:23.148 --> 1:13:24.858
Gosh. Darn it.

1:13:25.818 --> 1:13:28.862
Why do you move around so much
in your sleep?

1:13:28.946 --> 1:13:30.197
Unbelievable.

1:13:31.073 --> 1:13:34.076
Gam-ri, I can't sleep next to Suk-ja.

1:13:34.159 --> 1:13:36.078
She pulls the blanket all night

1:13:36.161 --> 1:13:38.163
and rests her limbs on my body.

1:13:38.247 --> 1:13:41.834
It's so infuriating. Gosh.

1:13:41.917 --> 1:13:43.627
Gam-ri, are you listening?

1:13:43.710 --> 1:13:46.130
You're sleeping awfully well
for a light sleeper.

1:13:46.213 --> 1:13:47.464
Gam-ri.

1:13:47.548 --> 1:13:49.842
Gam-ri. Gam…

1:14:34.887 --> 1:14:37.139
You said you wanted to go on a picnic.

1:14:40.767 --> 1:14:43.103
Did you have to be so impatient?

1:15:02.206 --> 1:15:03.582
Sleep well.

1:15:06.418 --> 1:15:08.128
Go on that picnic first.

1:15:12.174 --> 1:15:13.467
And…

1:15:16.178 --> 1:15:17.513
wait for me.

1:15:56.635 --> 1:15:57.636
What is that?

1:15:58.804 --> 1:16:00.055
What's wrong with him?

1:16:01.306 --> 1:16:02.724
He looks like a patient.

1:16:14.653 --> 1:16:16.238
Hello, sir.

1:16:16.321 --> 1:16:19.908
I'm calling from the Seogang Bridge.

1:16:19.992 --> 1:16:24.913
A man wearing a hospital gown
is crouching next to the guardrail.

1:16:24.997 --> 1:16:26.707
It looks dangerous.

1:16:27.541 --> 1:16:29.167
Can you quickly check on him?

1:16:30.335 --> 1:16:32.045
Thank you.

1:16:46.184 --> 1:16:47.686
AMBULANCE

1:18:13.855 --> 1:18:17.984
When you lose a loved one,
you should mourn plenty.

1:18:18.068 --> 1:18:22.364
Or else, the grief travels
all through your body,

1:18:22.447 --> 1:18:24.408
and it bursts later.

1:18:25.992 --> 1:18:28.036
I don't want to leave him alone.

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:30.455
I want to be his family.

1:18:30.539 --> 1:18:33.375
I'm you, and you're me.

1:18:33.458 --> 1:18:35.168
Open wide.

1:18:35.252 --> 1:18:36.962
I'll do this for you
every day from now on.

1:18:37.546 --> 1:18:40.298
<i>I'd love it if our shoes…</i>

1:18:40.924 --> 1:18:43.343
<i>were always side by side
at the door together.</i>

1:18:43.844 --> 1:18:45.137
Chief Hong.

1:18:46.388 --> 1:18:47.889
Will you marry me?

1:18:48.849 --> 1:18:53.854
