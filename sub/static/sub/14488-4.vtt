Okay, everybody

No point in staying
with just one demon.

Now, now, cuddle.
Cuddle with your demons.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.567
Amy, I wonder where
you are right now.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.361
I'm inside the dummy

Hooray denied!

Need I remind you that
robosexual marriage
is illegal?

Not in Space,

No chance, stretch pants!
We're gonna fight to
legalize it right here!

15:01.401 --> 15:03.944
Yeah, man!
You got to legalize it!

15:04.028 --> 15:06.572
We're talking about
robosexual marriage.

Squeaky, squishy clean.

But it's time to discuss
a pressing issue,

15:37.061 --> 15:39.896
the right to marry
who or what we want!

15:39.981 --> 15:41.273
ALL: Yeah!

15:41.357 --> 15:42.566
Legalize it!

16:51.844 --> 16:54.054
A storm of
robosexual marriage

16:54.138 --> 16:56.056
that will rain down on us
like fire.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.974
It's probably a firestorm.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.519
If robosexual
marriage becomes legal,

17:00.603 --> 17:03.939
imagine the horrible things
that will happen
to our children,

17:04.022 --> 17:05.732

we said those things,

17:05.817 --> 17:07.358

think of any.

Good evening.
I'm George Takei's

17:35.763 --> 17:38.932
your host for
tonight's debate.
You may applaud.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.437
We flipped a coin
before the debate,

17:43.521 --> 17:45.981
and Bender stole it,
so we'll start with him.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.486
Oops. Sorry,
force of habit.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.740
I support
this proposition

17:54.824 --> 17:58.660
because I love a goopy,
flesh-and-blood woman,

17:58.745 --> 18:01.163
and, not surprisingly,
she loves me.

18:02.415 --> 18:07.127
This is a simple
matter of justice,
which I'm not normally for.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.254
So, please, vote yes.

our love isn't any
different from yours,

'cause I'm involved.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.849
I haven't heard
such an eloquent speech

18:20.933 --> 18:24.144
since Bill Shatner explained
why he couldn't pay me back.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.979
Rebuttal, Professor?

18:26.063 --> 18:29.357
This $4 coffeepot
talks about love,

18:29.442 --> 18:31.860
but what he describes
is perversion!

18:31.986 --> 18:35.322
You wouldn't know perversion
if it put clamps
on your testicles!

18:35.406 --> 18:38.408
You're just jealous,
'cause you've never
known true love!

18:38.493 --> 18:43.455
Oh, no? Back when I was
full of piss and vinegar,
and my bed wasn't,

18:43.539 --> 18:46.041
I fell in love with
the sweetest girl

18:46.125 --> 18:49.294
ever to skip through
a field of posies.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.087
Her name was Eunice,

18:51.172 --> 18:54.216
and we spent
our blissful days
working in a lab,

18:54.300 --> 18:59.012
developing a poison to
wipe out that dreadful
posy infestation.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.850
I thought our love
would last forever.

19:03.935 --> 19:07.562
But then, 43 years later,
she left me

left you for a robot?

leave me for a robot,

At the risk of
losing this debate,

19:56.946 --> 20:00.782
I beg you, support

am hugging them

hugging me back.
