WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:07.268
Why haven't you returned
my calls, Jessie?
I've been with Hideki's crew.

00:07.311 --> 00:09.096
I've been listening
to the conversations

00:09.139 --> 00:11.228
you had with Nemoto.
Excuse me?

00:11.272 --> 00:12.664
There's a gap on the tape.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.666
You need to chill.
Whose side are you on?

00:14.710 --> 00:17.756
I've been doing my job--
the one you came to me with.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.063
You don't like the way I do it,
get someone else.

00:20.107 --> 00:23.153
VITO:
I've seen this guy before.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.589
Do you mention Danny
to this guy?

00:24.633 --> 00:27.070
You remember me,
Detective Williams?

00:27.114 --> 00:29.855
I told him about how my
nephew moved to Honolulu

00:29.899 --> 00:31.466
to become a cop
in paradise.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.467
That's how he tracked you here.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.816
Should I know who you are?

00:36.688 --> 00:38.473
STEVE:
Danny! Danny!

00:41.867 --> 00:44.087
MAN: This is on you.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.350
You make me act this way.
Please. Please, Ray.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.526
Please. I love you.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.528
I love you.

00:57.231 --> 01:00.103
You're lying.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.932
You don't mean it.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.935
MAN:
Police. Open up.

01:09.156 --> 01:12.115
Sir, we're responding
to a noise complaint.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.857
Uh, neighbors, uh, reported
some screaming and shouting.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.685
I'm sorry, Officer. Officers.

01:16.728 --> 01:19.122
What can I say? I got one
of those loud voices.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.081
:
I'll tone it down.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.213
Excuse me. Whoa, whoa.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.388
Hey. Step aside, please.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.824
Please step aside.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.783
Thank you.

01:27.826 --> 01:28.958
Ma'am, is everything okay?

01:29.001 --> 01:30.133
RAY:
Everything's fine.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.961
We just had a little argument,
is all.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.267
You know,
married couple stuff.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.529
Okay, okay. But I was...

01:34.572 --> 01:36.748
I was talking to the lady,
if you don't mind.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.620
Well...

01:39.969 --> 01:41.797
Then you tell him, honey.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.103
Like he said,

01:43.146 --> 01:45.105
it's over now.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.149
Okay.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.412
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

01:48.456 --> 01:50.022
to step outside.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.155
You gotta be kidding me.
If you don't mind, sir.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.070
Come on, come on,
come on.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.116
All right.

02:00.424 --> 02:03.297
Ma'am, may I please come inside?

02:04.472 --> 02:06.256
Yeah, sure.

02:07.692 --> 02:08.911
This is really unnecessary.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.956
It was just a...
a silly argument.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.221
: Look, I-I know
that you... that you...

02:15.657 --> 02:17.920
You're probably scared,
and you feel like

02:17.963 --> 02:19.182
you don't have any options,

02:19.226 --> 02:20.618
but that is not the case.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.446
That is not the case.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.274
Okay, I can help you,

02:24.318 --> 02:25.884
but you have got
to be straight with me.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.234
What do you want from me?

02:27.277 --> 02:30.280
I just... I just
want a statement.

02:30.324 --> 02:32.195
Just a statement:
the truth about what happened

02:32.239 --> 02:33.979
to your eye-- that's all.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.633
Okay?

02:37.287 --> 02:39.376
Please just go.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.249
Please.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.382
I'm asking you to leave.

02:50.561 --> 02:51.997
How about this?

02:53.956 --> 02:56.219
This is my card. Put it
somewhere he cannot see it.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.656
Hide it. If you change
your mind, you want to talk,

02:58.700 --> 03:01.616
you want any help at all,
call me, and I'll be here, okay?

03:04.227 --> 03:06.098
That's all.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.540
Let's go.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.762
Thanks for checking in,
Officers.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.220
Brooke.

03:40.263 --> 03:42.091
Danny.
Wow.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.788
You look fantastic.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.007
You look amazing.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.056
You're looking good yourself.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.276
No, no, I look, uh...
I look 20 years older.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.191
You look the exact same.

03:56.627 --> 03:57.802
You doing okay?

03:57.846 --> 03:59.239
Yeah, look at me.
I'm fantastic.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.241
You know?
Oh, that... that bullet,

04:01.284 --> 04:03.286
uh, missed my heart
by about three millimeters,

04:03.330 --> 04:05.767
so I am thinking
of going to Vegas,

04:05.810 --> 04:08.509
liquidating my pension,
see what we can do, you know?

04:08.552 --> 04:10.859
I still can't believe
Ray did that to you.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.643
After all these years.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.690
Some people hold grudges.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.651
OFFICER :
Driver, kill the engine.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.350
I want both hands
out the window.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.439
Step out of the vehicle!

04:25.482 --> 04:27.223
Slowly!

04:30.139 --> 04:31.967
Put both hands
on top of your head!

04:32.010 --> 04:33.403
Interlock your fingers!

04:33.447 --> 04:35.275
Now turn around!

04:37.494 --> 04:39.017
Get down on your knees!

04:39.061 --> 04:41.019
Face down!

my point that you're

05:43.343 --> 05:45.214

Yeah, well, we're meeting

06:09.238 --> 06:10.544
Ah.
Hmm.

06:10.587 --> 06:11.980
FRANK:
Fresh faces.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.286
Bright, optimistic eyes.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.592
These two must be new
around here.

06:15.636 --> 06:16.941
They are.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.290
This is Junior and Tani.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.683
I'd like you guys
to meet Frank Bama.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.468
And for the record,
Frank is the only person

06:21.511 --> 06:23.426
on God's green Earth who can go
shoeless in this office.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.645
Just so we're clear.

06:24.688 --> 06:25.863
Pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.299
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.692
Yeah.
STEVE: Frank's an
old friend of Five-O's.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.391
He's saved my ass more times
than I care to remember.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.435
He's exaggerating.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.002
Once or twice, max.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.178
Your boss probably
failed to mention

06:36.221 --> 06:38.572
how he, uh, repaid me for that

06:38.615 --> 06:41.401
by letting me crash
on his couch last year.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.446
Wow. For saving his life?
That hardly seems fair.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.622
JUNIOR: Hey, so what brings
you back to Hawaii, sir?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.407
Vay-cay. I'm Airbnb'ing

06:47.450 --> 06:49.887
this sweet little pad
down in Lanikai.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.107
And I had to come
by here and drop off

06:52.150 --> 06:54.239
a belated birthday gift
to Steve:

06:54.283 --> 06:57.591
that gorgeous Portuguese
guitar that he's pretending

06:57.634 --> 06:59.331
he doesn't know how to play.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.943
But, uh, speaking of vacations,

07:01.986 --> 07:04.685
uh, I gotta get on down
to the beach

07:04.728 --> 07:06.513
before I miss this, uh,
morning swell.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.210
Uh-huh. Okay.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.299
Okay, buddy. All right.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.518
Nice to meet you. Okay.
Hey, nice to meet you.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.215
Pleased to meet you.
Take care. All right.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.304
See you, Frank.
Okay. All right.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.480
You wanted to see me, sir?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.656
I did.
I have an assignment for you.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.310
Okay. Whatever you need.

07:21.353 --> 07:23.660
You remember I asked you
to complete the HPD Academy

07:23.704 --> 07:25.619
before you became a member
of this task force?

07:25.662 --> 07:27.882
Right, now, you got
your Five-O badge early

07:27.925 --> 07:30.362
because you earned it.

07:30.406 --> 07:34.497
But there is one last thing
that HPD Academy recruits

07:34.541 --> 07:37.457
are required to do
before they graduate.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.461
And that...

07:43.245 --> 07:45.465
...is walk a beat.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.470
Please tell me
he has to wear that.

07:50.513 --> 07:51.645
Sir...

07:51.688 --> 07:53.647
One day, Junior.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.432
All right?
You're gonna wear this uniform,

07:56.476 --> 07:59.087
work one shift, see things
from a cop's point of view.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.218
Okay?

08:00.262 --> 08:01.655
They're our front line,
and there's

08:01.698 --> 08:02.656
no work more honorable.

08:02.699 --> 08:05.572
Commander, I agree.

08:05.615 --> 08:08.313
But, respectfully,
I must ask the question--

08:08.357 --> 08:11.534
why am I the only new recruit
doing the honorable work?

08:14.972 --> 08:17.758
You make a very good point.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.155
You just had to open
your mouth, didn't you?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.593
You just had to be
in the room.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.511
Come on.
Clearly, this is a setup.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.295
I mean, you guys get
an anonymous tip,

08:33.338 --> 08:35.602
then you pull Adam over
and you find a dead body

08:35.645 --> 08:36.646
in the trunk of his car?

08:36.690 --> 08:37.995
It's not just
any dead body.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.693
It's Hideki Tashiro.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.259
That's right.

08:41.303 --> 08:44.872
As you know, he and Noshimuri
had a run-in recently.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.526
That's motive in my book.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.576
Hey.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.839
You got five minutes.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.497
All right.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.760
Listen, man,
I know you didn't do it.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.153
All right?

09:05.196 --> 09:06.633
Now, here's what's
gonna happen.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.591
The autopsy results
are gonna be back soon.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.114
Time of death
will be established.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.856
Now, if whoever set you up
is as smart as I think they are,

09:12.900 --> 09:15.467
they will have planned this
so you do not have an alibi.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.774
Which means I gotta get out,
I gotta start working this case.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.776
Got it.
All right, good. Now...

09:19.820 --> 09:21.648
do you have any idea
who would want

09:21.691 --> 09:23.214
to pin Hideki's
murder on you?

09:23.258 --> 09:24.564
There's one obvious candidate.
Uh-huh.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.913
Whoever Hideki
was reporting to.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.697
The real boss-- the one
I've been tracking.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.656
Especially if they found out
about the task force.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.962
Yeah. I'm thinking
Hideki's number got called

09:32.006 --> 09:33.660
when he failed
to deliver Shioma's money.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.575
The boss takes him out,
and while they're at it,

09:35.618 --> 09:37.489
they pin the murder on me.

09:37.533 --> 09:38.795
However, it doesn't explain
how you were made.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.580
And, Adam, as far as
I'm concerned, there's only

09:40.623 --> 09:42.320
one person who could
have outed you.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.540
Jessie?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.673
Yes, Jessie.

09:46.716 --> 09:50.590
Can you think of any reason
why she would turn on you?

09:52.809 --> 09:55.682
What?
What's that look?

09:55.725 --> 09:59.294
I recently found out she's been
withholding some information.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.948
Look, I-I called
her out on it.

10:00.991 --> 10:02.384
We argued.

10:02.427 --> 10:05.561
On top of that, things have
been a bit tense lately.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.563
I think it's fair to
say this assignment

10:07.607 --> 10:09.217
has been a lot more
than she bargained for.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.699
Fine. Let me
rephrase the question.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.702
Do you think it's possible
Jessie turned on you?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.801
All right, I-I can't see
any of the addresses.

10:27.844 --> 10:31.718
This side looks like it's
evens, but I'm not sure.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.720
MAN: Are you insane?

10:33.763 --> 10:36.157
If you throw those
Jordans out...

10:36.200 --> 10:38.638
These? You want...
you want these?
No, no, no, no, no,

10:38.681 --> 10:39.987
no, no, no, no, no!
Found it.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.380
Baby, please!
Just relax.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.034
What are you doing, baby?
Just please...
Stupid shirt.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.253
Take that shirt.
Just please, please,
please, please, please.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.950
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

10:46.994 --> 10:48.430
Just... just stop, babe.

10:48.473 --> 10:49.736
All right, that's enough.
Just stop.

10:49.779 --> 10:50.998
MAN:
Just tell her to stop!

10:51.041 --> 10:52.260
Okay, all right, that's enough.
JUNIOR: Ma'am?

10:52.303 --> 10:53.478
Get... get down here.
Baby!

10:53.522 --> 10:54.479
Get down here right now, ma'am.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.655
This is the last. That's it.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.876
All right... give
me a sec, okay?

10:59.920 --> 11:01.443
I'll be right back.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.620
Okay. All right.
So, spoke to her.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.969
Apparently, he comes
home last night

11:06.013 --> 11:07.884
at 3:00 a.m.--
no text, no phone call.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.494
She checks the
GPS on his phone.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.018
Turns out he was
at a fancy hotel.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.934
Insult to injury, it's
her birthday today, so...

11:13.977 --> 11:16.588
Well, there's nothing
to charge them with, so I say

11:16.632 --> 11:17.981
we just let them sort it out.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.983
Right, so we're just
gonna brush over the fact

11:20.027 --> 11:21.028
that he's obviously
cheating on her?

11:21.071 --> 11:22.551
Well, that's speculative.

11:22.594 --> 11:25.249
And even if he was,
it's not a crime.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.990
That is so typical.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.862
Take his side.
Well done, well done.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.429
What? J-Just because he was
at a hotel late last night

11:31.473 --> 11:32.779
doesn't mean he was
being unfaithful.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.303
Oh, oh, please continue
mansplaining that to me,

11:35.346 --> 11:38.349
'cause here in reality,
that makes no logical sense.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.960
Tani, he wasn't cheating on her.
Really

11:40.003 --> 11:41.526
What else was he
doing, then, huh?

11:41.570 --> 11:43.224
He was setting up a room
for her birthday weekend.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.053
Ocean-view suite,
dinner reservations.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.750
Bookings for
massages at a spa.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.447
It was all supposed
to be a surprise,

11:49.491 --> 11:50.927
which you have now just ruined.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.496
I mean, he didn't
have to do that.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.454
She just wanted
quality time with him.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.456
Yeah, I know, but, you know,
intimacy doesn't come

11:58.500 --> 11:59.936
as easily for my boy, you know?

11:59.980 --> 12:01.285
He's really trying, you know?

12:01.329 --> 12:03.723
That's why he set
all of this up.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.552
All righty.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.858
Well, job well done.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.947
All right,
you folks have fun.

12:10.991 --> 12:15.082
McNEAL:
That is an interesting
story you're spinning.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.041
But here are the facts.

12:18.085 --> 12:21.436
We caught you on your way
to dump the body.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.917
You and Hideki, you had history.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.920
Yeah, he was a person
of interest in my investigation,

12:26.963 --> 12:28.791
if that's what you mean.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.967
Oh.

12:31.011 --> 12:34.710
You know, I can see your
face is still bruised.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.190
That's right--
we know about

12:36.233 --> 12:37.887
your little trek
into the woods

12:37.931 --> 12:39.280
with Hideki.

12:39.323 --> 12:43.240
He must have really
worked you over.

12:43.284 --> 12:46.722
I don't know if I could
take a beating like that

12:46.766 --> 12:49.812
and not want to get even.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.467
Look, he was under
the mistaken impression

12:52.510 --> 12:53.903
that I knew where
Michelle Shioma

12:53.947 --> 12:55.209
had buried $20 million.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.907
And when you couldn't
get him the money?

12:59.343 --> 13:02.607
See, I think you still have
that debt around your neck

13:02.651 --> 13:04.305
and that's why you took him out.

13:04.348 --> 13:07.134
You know, everything you're
saying makes perfect sense,

13:07.177 --> 13:09.310
only it didn't happen that way.

13:09.353 --> 13:12.008
My task force
was committed

13:12.052 --> 13:13.053
to finding the person
who murdered

13:13.096 --> 13:14.445
Agent Fischer and his family.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.186
My intel suggested
that it wasn't Hideki,

13:16.230 --> 13:17.884
it was someone above him.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.189
A new player pulling
the strings.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.630
Who?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.894
I don't know yet.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.725
I suppose there is someone

13:33.769 --> 13:35.945
who could help
corroborate your story.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.512
The C.I. you mentioned--

13:37.555 --> 13:39.862
the person you had working on
the inside of the Yakuza--

13:39.906 --> 13:41.646
why don't you let
us bring 'em in,

13:41.690 --> 13:44.084
see if they back you up?

13:49.219 --> 13:51.178
No.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.963
No, I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

13:54.007 --> 13:57.140
I won't divulge
an informant's identity.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.404
Then you'll go down for murder.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.166
Yeah. That's Ray.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.868
Is that all I have to do
to identify him?

14:28.911 --> 14:30.347
There's still some
paperwork, ma'am.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.047
Can you actually
give us a minute, please?

14:34.090 --> 14:36.223
DANNY:
Thanks.

14:39.269 --> 14:42.359
I'm so sorry, Danny,
for what he did to you.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.405
Do not apologize
for him, please.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.669
Habit of a lifetime, I guess.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.151
You okay?

14:52.108 --> 14:55.068
Actually, yeah.

14:56.721 --> 15:00.160
I know it's not what you're
supposed to say, but...

15:01.770 --> 15:04.251
I'm glad he's gone.

15:04.294 --> 15:06.949
He won't be able
to hurt anyone ever again.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.779
Yeah, you know, I-I generally
don't believe in karma--

15:10.822 --> 15:13.695
uh, too many bad things
happen to good people--

15:13.738 --> 15:15.088
but in this case...

15:15.131 --> 15:16.480
maybe.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.265
You know, for the
longest time,

15:18.308 --> 15:22.095
I was sure it was gonna
be the other way around.

15:22.138 --> 15:26.708
It would be me lying on the slab
and Ray standing here.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.928
Well, you were strong enough
to get away from him.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.843
I think Ray underestimated
how resilient you are.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.107
You, too.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.608
DANNY: Hey.
Hey.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.958
You all right?

16:00.046 --> 16:02.439
Yeah. Sorry, I...

16:02.483 --> 16:05.312
Every time I hear a car pull up,
I just think he's found out

16:05.355 --> 16:07.140
where I am.
I'm sorry.

16:07.183 --> 16:10.186
Look, I-I, um... I spoke
to the, uh... the people

16:10.230 --> 16:12.014
over at the women's shelter
over on Fairmont.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
They said, uh, that
a spot opened up.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.323
You'd be completely
safe there, and, uh,

16:16.366 --> 16:17.672
you know, it's anonymous.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.935
Until you figure out
what you want to do next.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.371
Thank you.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.156
Yeah, of course.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.635
So, I-I'm sorry to scare you.
I just...

16:24.679 --> 16:26.724
I just wanted to come by
and see how you're doing.

16:26.768 --> 16:27.725
That's all.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.292
Oh, and I-I got you

16:29.336 --> 16:30.772
a couple sandwiches.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.947
Couple things, some...
some toiletries.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.253
I don't know
what you have, so...

16:33.296 --> 16:34.732
Wow. That is...

16:34.776 --> 16:36.212
that is above
and beyond the call.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.171
I mean...
No, no, no.
It's nothing.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.346
I-I can't have you eating

16:39.389 --> 16:40.869
the Twinkies
from the vending machine.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.349
They could be 25 years old.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.960
Anyway,

16:45.004 --> 16:46.353
I'm gonna go now, but...
Well...

16:46.396 --> 16:49.356
well, why don't you bring it in?

16:49.399 --> 16:50.879
Yeah?
Yeah.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.403
All right. Thank you.

16:55.231 --> 16:56.885
GROVER: Any news?
STEVE: McNeal's still
questioning him.

16:56.928 --> 16:59.496
I'm pretty sure he knows
that Adam isn't the killer,

16:59.540 --> 17:01.237
but until we put whoever
did it in the frame,

17:01.281 --> 17:02.195
he's not going anywhere.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.326
All right, so what now?

17:03.370 --> 17:04.762
Well, right now we
need to track down

17:04.806 --> 17:06.025
Adam's C.I., Jessie Nomura.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.896
Adam was worried
he couldn't

17:07.939 --> 17:09.376
trust Jessie anymore.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.204
Yeah, he told me
she's been sleeping

17:11.247 --> 17:12.422
with one of
Hideki's lieutenants.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.381
Guy by the name
of Kazuya Nemoto.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.992
Mr. Chlorine Heist.
What are you talking about?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.081
We had him in here
a few days ago.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.430
I heard he made bail.

17:20.474 --> 17:22.041
I presume we got
a current address.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.260
GROVER:
McGarrett, better get in here.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.177
In there.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.449
That Nemoto?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.277
Hard to say.
Take a look through that hole.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.063
Half his face is blown off.
Those are his tats, though.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.044
Excuse me.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.132
Hey.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.308
Danny.
You all right?

18:13.353 --> 18:15.529
He went by my sister's.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.835
Found out
I wasn't staying there.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.101
He knows I'm seeing someone.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.754
It's all right.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.148
I swear...

18:26.192 --> 18:28.107
I didn't tell him about us.
Don't worry.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.978
Listen to me. Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna take care of this.

18:30.021 --> 18:30.979
You understand?
I promise you I'm gonna

18:31.022 --> 18:32.023
take care of this right now.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.808
Okay? You're
gonna be okay.

18:33.851 --> 18:34.939
All right?
Okay.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.071
Come on. Let's go.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.899
Just relax.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.249
You'll be all right.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.819
Son of a bitch.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.303
He doesn't deserve this.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.608
Well, what are you gonna do?

18:51.652 --> 18:53.436
Travel all the way back
to Jersey with it?

18:53.480 --> 18:55.438
Pay for a burial, you know?

18:55.482 --> 18:59.138
That or flush him
down the toilet at the airport.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.444
You know, I obviously
wasn't a fan of the guy.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.054
Um...

19:03.098 --> 19:05.492
you do what you gotta do,
but I-I think that this...

19:05.535 --> 19:08.277
this should be about you,
not about him.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.978
♪

19:41.876 --> 19:43.878
♪

19:58.414 --> 20:01.069
I don't know about you,
but I could use a drink.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.027
Okay.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.340
You know,
nothing against musubis,

20:11.384 --> 20:13.734
but it's a snack food;
it's not a meal.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.866
Hey, I wasn't the one
who suggested

20:15.910 --> 20:18.565
we rock-paper-scissors
over where we get lunch, okay?

20:21.394 --> 20:24.005
Six hours down,
six hours to go.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.528
Hey, you do realize

20:25.572 --> 20:27.574
that this is what
you would be doing every day

20:27.617 --> 20:29.706
if you hadn't been kicked out
of the academy, right?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.926
Yeah, I'm aware. You don't
become a cop because

20:31.969 --> 20:33.667
you're psyched to chase
down public urinators

20:33.710 --> 20:35.277
and get shot at.

20:35.321 --> 20:39.107
Joining the force
was never about me being happy.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.717
Yeah?

20:40.761 --> 20:43.024
What was it about, then?

20:45.548 --> 20:49.030
Well... before my dad died,

20:49.073 --> 20:51.511
it was really just
the three of us.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.077
'Cause, you know,
we moved so much,

20:53.121 --> 20:54.818
so it was hard
to make real friends.

20:55.993 --> 20:59.345
And Koa and I were
actually really close.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.739
Yeah, we had
a lot of fun.

21:05.046 --> 21:08.092
We got in a lot
of trouble.

21:08.136 --> 21:13.402
And, uh, somewhere along
the line, I realized I...

21:13.446 --> 21:15.752
I'd been setting
the wrong example.

21:17.276 --> 21:21.845
And I decided that it was
time to set the right one.

21:23.804 --> 21:26.328
And the irony is that
now that I'm a cop,

21:26.372 --> 21:28.287
our relationship's
never been worse.

21:29.766 --> 21:31.246
Sucks being the good guy, huh?

21:31.290 --> 21:32.595
Struggle's real.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.728
Yeah.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.251
Hey!

21:36.295 --> 21:38.514
Did we say that you could stop?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.168
I already
covered my tag.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.343
Uh-huh.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.221
Voilà.

21:50.265 --> 21:52.223
Why do I have to paint
this whole wall?

21:52.267 --> 21:54.965
Because it's better than
getting booked for vandalism.

21:55.009 --> 21:58.969
And under section 708
of the Hawaiian Penal Code,

21:59.013 --> 22:00.623
it's a misdemeanor charge,

22:00.667 --> 22:03.104
so you can get charged
up to a thousand bucks.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.453
You got a thousand bucks?

22:04.497 --> 22:05.367
TANI:
What?

22:05.411 --> 22:06.499
Somebody read the manual.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.327
Yeah, I kind of
improvised a little bit

22:08.370 --> 22:10.285
on the section number,
but who cares?
Well done.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.809
TANI: Okay, so we want
two coats of that.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.550
Mm-hmm.
And you know what?
I think that I want

22:14.594 --> 22:16.291
really crisp edges.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.988
You think you can
handle that, Picasso?

22:18.032 --> 22:21.905
We want crisp edges.

22:21.949 --> 22:25.256
GROVER: Ballistics are back
on the Hideki postmortem.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.823
Gun was a .45.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.999
I ran it.
No hits in the system.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.175
Nemoto, on the other hand,
they got him with a shotgun.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.047
You know what
the chances are of getting

22:33.090 --> 22:35.049
any useful ballistics
off one of them things?

22:35.092 --> 22:36.398
I just told the lab
never mind.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.791
Timing is too
convenient, all right?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.401
I don't care if the
ballistics don't match.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.272
These murders have
gotta be connected.

22:41.316 --> 22:44.537
Well, I mean, it does suggest
more than one shooter.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.756
If we could prove that,
that would really help Adam.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.976
Of course, we can't.
Yeah?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.414
HPD just got eyes
on Jessie's car.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.198
Where is it?

23:14.305 --> 23:15.394
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:15.437 --> 23:17.439
What was the matter
with that lane?

23:17.483 --> 23:20.137
Hey. Whoa. Hey!

23:20.747 --> 23:21.922
That's her.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.716
We have a wreck,
my wife is gonna kick your ass.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.530
I'm boxed in!

24:32.296 --> 24:34.473
♪

25:33.357 --> 25:34.924
OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

25:34.968 --> 25:36.622
This is off-duty
Officer Danny Williams.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.624
My badge number is A686D.

25:38.667 --> 25:41.452
I'm in front of Harry's Cellar
on 56th and Eastman.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.454
I got a potential DUI.
Send over a unit.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.500
I will hold him in his car until
you guys get here, all right?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.807
Copy that. A car is en route.

25:49.156 --> 25:51.462
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, now.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.639
Come on, come on, come on.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.303
What the hell do you want?
I'm gonna ask

26:06.347 --> 26:08.392
the questions, if that's...
if that's okay with you.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.612
You can't charge me
with nothing.

26:10.656 --> 26:11.961
I was gonna sleep it off.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.007
I just turned the engine on
to get the heat going.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.138
I'm not here because of that.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.226
I'm here because you put

26:16.270 --> 26:17.445
your wife
in the hospital tonight.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.316
You know? And I...
I was gonna tell you,

26:19.360 --> 26:21.884
if you... you feel
like hitting somebody,

26:21.928 --> 26:23.364
next time I'll give
you my phone number,

26:23.407 --> 26:24.539
you give me a call,
you can hit me.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.497
Does that sound
all right, tough guy?

26:26.541 --> 26:29.370
Are you gonna charge me
with something, Officer?

26:31.024 --> 26:32.808
Because if not...
Uh-huh.

26:32.852 --> 26:35.506
I'm gonna get back
in my car.

26:35.550 --> 26:36.943
Okay. Okay.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.598
Go ahead. I-I just know
why you hit her tonight.

26:39.641 --> 26:42.165
It was 'cause you found out she
was sleeping with somebody else.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.254
So that's all.
That's all.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.474
And I also...
I also know

26:46.517 --> 26:47.910
that she wouldn't
tell you who it was

26:47.954 --> 26:49.433
no matter how bad you beat her.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.958
I'm gonna do you a solid
'cause I'm a nice guy.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.700
I'm gonna tell you who has
been sleeping with your wife.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.397
It's me.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.095
I'm the guy that's been
sleeping with your wife.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.707
I thought you
should know that.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.012
And-and this is
the craziest part.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.274
It's her words, not mine.

27:04.318 --> 27:05.711
She told me that I am

27:05.754 --> 27:07.495
more of a man
than you ever were.

27:07.538 --> 27:08.670
Even before you
started drinking so much

27:08.714 --> 27:10.063
that you couldn't
get it up anymore.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.847
How about that?
Crazy stuff, huh?

27:11.891 --> 27:14.545
You believe that

27:24.730 --> 27:26.557
OFFICER:
Stop! Step away!

27:29.212 --> 27:30.474
Step away.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.651
Over. On your stomach.

27:34.914 --> 27:37.656
Stay still. I said still.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.532
Get off me!
Come on.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.332
Everything okay?

28:02.376 --> 28:03.594
Everything's good.

28:03.638 --> 28:05.945
I was just, uh... just thinking.

28:05.988 --> 28:07.773
Tell me.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.734
Uh, I was... I was just
thinking about, uh...

28:12.778 --> 28:15.345
the night that Ray got arrested

28:15.389 --> 28:19.175
and how it changed
the course of his life.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.003
He never really got over it.

28:21.047 --> 28:24.485
For me, I didn't really
think about it ever again,

28:24.528 --> 28:26.966
so much so I didn't even
recognize him when I saw him.

28:27.009 --> 28:29.011
And it's...
it's a trip

28:29.055 --> 28:31.927
how, uh, two people
can experience

28:31.971 --> 28:34.800
the same moment,
uh, so differently.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.149
You know?

28:36.192 --> 28:39.195
The difference is
you lived your life.

28:40.588 --> 28:41.807
Had a family, moved on.

28:43.199 --> 28:45.506
Ray spent all those years

28:45.549 --> 28:48.552
blaming other people
for his failings.

28:52.513 --> 28:54.689
STEVE:
Jessie, why don't you
help me out with something?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.082
As Adam's C.I.,

28:56.125 --> 28:57.779
you had to know
you were protected,

28:57.823 --> 29:00.477
so when the HPD tried
to pull you over, why'd you run?

29:00.521 --> 29:02.262
Look at things
from my perspective.

29:02.305 --> 29:03.611
Hideki is dead.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.308
When I call Adam to find out

29:05.352 --> 29:06.962
what's going on,
he doesn't answer.

29:07.006 --> 29:09.922
So I go see one of my contacts,
Kazuya Nemoto,

29:09.965 --> 29:11.880
only to find
that he's been iced, too.

29:13.577 --> 29:15.188
Kazuya Nemoto.

29:16.232 --> 29:17.407
The guy you've been

29:17.451 --> 29:19.714
sleeping with.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.585
You mean him, right?

29:21.629 --> 29:24.588
STEVE:
Jessie, Adam runs his task force
under our supervision.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.590
So, if he has any reason
to question the commitment

29:26.634 --> 29:28.592
or the loyalty of
his informant, he's obliged

29:28.636 --> 29:30.203
to share that with us.
You understand me?

29:30.246 --> 29:32.422
GROVER: How the hell
you think we found out

29:32.466 --> 29:34.598
about all that "contacting"
you've been doing with Nemoto?

29:34.642 --> 29:38.080
Much as I'm enjoying
this conversation,

29:38.124 --> 29:41.475
why am I sitting here with you
and not my handler?

29:42.563 --> 29:44.434
Where's Adam?
You're really gonna

29:44.478 --> 29:46.480
just sit there and pretend
like you don't know?

29:46.523 --> 29:48.134
Know what?

29:48.177 --> 29:49.962
Oh, boy.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.529
Adam was arrested
earlier today

29:52.573 --> 29:55.663
on suspicion of murdering
Hideki Tashiro.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.839
HPD pulled him over
on an anonymous tip.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.059
They found the body
in the trunk of his car.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.539
Someone tried
to set him up

30:02.583 --> 30:04.280
to put an end
to the task force.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.978
See, the only problem is--

30:06.021 --> 30:08.502
how would someone even know

30:08.545 --> 30:11.592
that the task force existed
in the first place?

30:13.550 --> 30:15.465
You think I gave him up?

30:15.509 --> 30:16.902
Then why did you run?

30:16.945 --> 30:19.034
Because, when the two people
closest to you

30:19.078 --> 30:20.470
in an organization are killed,

30:20.514 --> 30:22.516
you don't have to be
a math genius

30:22.559 --> 30:23.865
to figure out who dies next.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.347
Hideki knew he was on thin ice

30:27.390 --> 30:29.088
after he couldn't deliver
Shioma's money.

30:29.131 --> 30:30.829
That's why he'd gone to ground.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.526
What are you talking about?

30:32.569 --> 30:34.180
He was full-on paranoid.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.746
Had holed himself up
at this construction site.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.879
And when I showed up this
morning to bring him supplies,

30:37.923 --> 30:40.839
he was gone
and the place was a bloodbath.

30:40.882 --> 30:44.930
I guess that makes that place
our primary crime scene.

30:44.973 --> 30:47.541
We're gonna need you to take
us to that construction site.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.064
You got a problem with that?

30:49.108 --> 30:51.284
No.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.591
JUNIOR:
You don't even drive a car.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.289
You ride a scooter.

30:56.332 --> 30:57.943
You have the least
driving experience.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.814
Okay, just give it up,
all right? I have seniority.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.207
I'm driving. That's it.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.730
You got like two months
seniority on me.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.514
Yep.
Okay? Next place
we're stopping,

31:04.558 --> 31:06.603
we're swapping places.
No, we're not. Your
driving makes me carsick.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.431
That's it. You want me
to throw up on you?

31:08.475 --> 31:10.738
I'll throw up on you if
that's what you want.
Hey, hey, hey.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.393
Check it out.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.525
Shouldn't he
be in school?

31:15.569 --> 31:17.658
TANI:
You are such a buzzkill.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.616
JUNIOR:
Seriously.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.583
JUNIOR: Hey.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

31:31.672 --> 31:33.761
JUNIOR: Hey, slow down.
I just want to talk.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.545
Hey.
I didn't steal
the cart. I swear.

31:35.589 --> 31:36.807
I found it in the street.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.766
Hey. It's all right.
You're not in trouble.

31:38.809 --> 31:39.680
What's your name?

31:39.723 --> 31:40.942
Kawika.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.944
Kawika, it's kind of
a tough neighborhood

31:42.988 --> 31:44.685
for you to be walking
around all by yourself.

31:44.728 --> 31:45.555
Where's your mom?

31:45.599 --> 31:46.992
She's dead.

31:47.035 --> 31:49.646
All right, well,
is your dad home?

31:49.690 --> 31:51.648
His car's there,
but sometimes he gets sick

31:51.692 --> 31:52.649
and he falls asleep.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.283
Sir

32:17.326 --> 32:18.806
Hey, buddy, can you hear me?

32:20.634 --> 32:22.027
Okay.

32:32.559 --> 32:33.952
Okay.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.650
Sounds good.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.827
All right, let me talk
to you for a sec.

32:39.870 --> 32:42.395
So, you know how
we helped you get home?

32:42.438 --> 32:44.266
Um, well, your dad
also needs some help,

32:44.310 --> 32:46.616
so we were thinking that we'd
take him down to the station

32:46.660 --> 32:48.140
and get him sorted out there.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.837
Is that cool with you?

32:49.880 --> 32:51.839
Yeah. Okay.
All right.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.536
So, in the meantime,
you're gonna hang out

32:53.580 --> 32:55.103
down the street
with your Auntie Lea.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.019
Do you think
I could walk you there?

32:58.063 --> 33:00.021
All right.
Let's do it.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.527
Love you, Daddy.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.442
I love you, too, son.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.844
Thank you, Officer.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.333
What?

33:51.377 --> 33:54.771
Wait. I don't understand.
STEVE: What?

33:54.815 --> 33:56.643
There was a trailer here.
Oh, here we go.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.688
Right there.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.081
That's where Hideki
was holed up.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.604
Where he was killed.
GROVER: Mm-hmm.

34:01.648 --> 34:05.304
I'm 100% positive there
was a trailer there.

34:06.348 --> 34:07.610
Hey, Lou?

34:07.654 --> 34:09.699
She's right.
There was something here.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.005
Look at these tracks.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.834
You're saying somebody
stole our crime scene?

34:13.877 --> 34:14.835
That's a first.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.619
Yeah. And if we
want to get Adam

34:16.663 --> 34:18.404
out of custody...

34:18.447 --> 34:19.970
we gotta find it.

34:25.237 --> 34:28.022
All right, man.
I appreciate that. Thank you.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.980
All right, that was
an old buddy of mine.

34:30.024 --> 34:32.070
He's gonna patch us into
the keyhole satellite system.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.725
Here we go.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.728
There it is.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.604
GROVER:
And there goes
our crime scene.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.954
Okay. Looks like
they pulled that trailer

34:46.997 --> 34:48.738
out of here
about two hours ago.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.000
Hey, back-back that up
a little bit.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.786
Zoom in.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.004
How-how far can you
punch in there?

34:57.182 --> 34:59.053
GROVER:
We got 'em.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.057
Five-O! On the ground!

35:03.101 --> 35:05.059
On the ground!

35:06.974 --> 35:08.106
GROVER:
So much for them surrendering.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.526
Clear.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.093
Clear.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.532
♪

35:51.453 --> 35:52.628
Hey.

35:52.672 --> 35:54.543
So, I just spoke
to the booking sergeant,

35:54.587 --> 35:56.589
and he thinks
that the prosecuting attorney

35:56.632 --> 35:58.373
will go for
conditional probation

35:58.417 --> 36:01.071
as long as Kawika's father
enters a rehab program.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.812
Good.

36:09.515 --> 36:13.171
You know, what you
did for that kid,

36:13.214 --> 36:16.086
that was pretty awesome.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.005
Yeah. I can't remember
all the times

36:22.049 --> 36:24.617
my dad got arrested, but...

36:24.660 --> 36:27.794
I do remember the first time
I saw him in cuffs.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.801
All right, so, um,
just to be clear,

36:34.844 --> 36:37.020
by no means did I
enjoy today.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.544
Noted.

36:38.587 --> 36:41.938
But, you know, if I'm being
honest, it wasn't...

36:41.982 --> 36:44.071
wasn't the worst day.

36:50.947 --> 36:53.036
All right,
that's all you, Superman.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.132
Oh, ma'am, let me
give you a hand.

37:03.786 --> 37:04.961
WOMAN:
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.094
Oh, man!

37:07.137 --> 37:09.879
Oh! Oh, why would
you do that?

37:09.923 --> 37:12.186
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.275
Help!

37:14.319 --> 37:15.581
Tani!
Help!

37:18.192 --> 37:21.282
All right, uh,
I should, uh...

37:21.326 --> 37:23.458
I should probably get going.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.076
Okay, good.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.733
Take care.
Yep.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.794
DANNY:
Hey.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.491
Oh, hey.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.188
My God, your eye.

37:58.232 --> 37:59.364
Oh, this is nothing.
Come on.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.104
It was worth it.
The guy's gonna go away

38:01.148 --> 38:03.193
for a very long time.
All right?

38:03.237 --> 38:05.152
How you doing?

38:05.195 --> 38:06.414
Good, huh?

38:06.458 --> 38:08.286
What's it feel like
to, uh... to be home?

38:08.329 --> 38:09.330
Oh... little weird.
Yeah?

38:09.374 --> 38:10.679
But, you know, it's not forever.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.681
It's just till I can
sell the house, so...

38:12.725 --> 38:15.423
You-you got, uh... you got
a new place lined up or...?

38:15.467 --> 38:17.120
No, not yet. I...

38:17.164 --> 38:19.384
was thinking about
making a move.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.211
Maybe try out the West Coast.

38:21.255 --> 38:23.649
I just...

38:23.692 --> 38:26.521
think a fresh start
would be good, you know?

38:26.565 --> 38:28.654
Sure.

38:28.697 --> 38:30.656
Look, thank you.

38:30.699 --> 38:34.921
For, uh...
everything.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.444
You, uh...

38:36.488 --> 38:38.272
you saved my life.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.406
Oh, no, I-I was, uh...
I was just doing my job.

38:41.449 --> 38:43.277
Well, most of the time.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.365
Yeah.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.542
Uh...

38:47.586 --> 38:51.285
well, uh... take care.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.200
Huh?
You, too.

38:55.942 --> 38:58.161
If you need anything,
you call me, okay?

38:58.205 --> 38:59.337
I will.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.251
Yeah

39:19.313 --> 39:21.010
You gotta be kidding me.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.405
WOMAN: Shoot.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.060
Uh, I'm, um...

39:28.714 --> 39:30.280
Uh... hi.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.282
Um...

39:32.326 --> 39:34.197
Hi. I'm so sorry.
Hi.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.156
Uh, I...

39:36.199 --> 39:38.332
It's completely my fault.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.942
Yeah.
Um...

39:39.986 --> 39:43.468
I-I saw your brake light go off,
and I thought that you-you...

39:43.511 --> 39:45.687
I mean, that you would...
You were... you were stopped,

39:45.731 --> 39:47.297
and then you...
You know what?

39:47.341 --> 39:48.298
Don't worry about this.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.691
No, I will...
My name's Rachel.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.301
Nice to meet you. Daniel.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.302
Daniel.
Yes.

39:52.346 --> 39:55.262
Um, I'll give you my number.

39:55.305 --> 39:57.264
Give you my...
Yes, you should definitely
write down your phone number.

39:57.307 --> 39:58.700
That would make up
for everything.

39:58.744 --> 39:59.962
You give me your number,
and we'll forget

40:00.006 --> 40:01.050
this ever happened.
How about that?

40:01.094 --> 40:02.487
Everything's fine.
Okay.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.273
Yo.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.623
Hey! Oh!

40:08.667 --> 40:10.756
Man, what's your
mom feeding you?

40:10.799 --> 40:12.584
You feel like you've been
eating trees or something.

40:12.627 --> 40:13.715
Danny, I'm sorry.
Hey.

40:13.759 --> 40:16.326
Um, we got lost in
a Pete the Cat story.

40:16.370 --> 40:17.937
I still need to pack his bag.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.547
Yeah, go ahead.
I'll wait.

40:22.332 --> 40:24.422
Why don't you come in
and finish it with him?

40:24.465 --> 40:27.163
Okay. You want to...
you want to...

40:27.207 --> 40:29.644
you want to read the
rest of this book

40:29.688 --> 40:31.429
All right, come on.
Let's go.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.044
Apply these drops
every four hours,

40:38.087 --> 40:40.176
and it should
clear up soon.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.787
Thanks.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.313
Hi.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.967
Can you even see me?

40:48.010 --> 40:49.534
How many fingers
am I holding up?

40:49.577 --> 40:50.883
Probably just one.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.319
Yeah.

40:52.362 --> 40:54.452
Well...

40:54.495 --> 40:56.976
uh, just so
you're aware, um,

40:57.019 --> 40:59.108
I will be telling
everyone about this.

40:59.152 --> 41:02.285
And I mean everyone,
starting with McGarrett.

41:04.026 --> 41:07.290
Well, I suppose there's no way
I could buy your silence.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.249
Are you kidding me?

41:09.292 --> 41:11.077
No. I'm sorry.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.948
The Golden Child gets
owned by a grandma?

41:12.992 --> 41:16.125
That's... that
is priceless.

41:30.444 --> 41:32.490
Mr. Noshimuri,
you're free to go.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.544
ADAM:
So, by the time you got there,

41:43.588 --> 41:45.328
there was no evidence?

41:45.372 --> 41:47.592
No. But the crew that
was cleaning the scene

41:47.635 --> 41:50.551
were affiliated with a
Japanese faction of the Yakuza.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.118
The fact that they
were destroying evidence

41:52.161 --> 41:53.554
while you were
still in custody

41:53.598 --> 41:55.513
was enough to make the case
against you fall apart.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.081
We were wrong
about Jessie, too.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.779
She didn't sell you out.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.477
Then who did?

42:03.521 --> 42:05.566
I mean, did I slip up?

42:05.610 --> 42:07.002
We don't know.

42:07.046 --> 42:08.482
We don't know
anything right now.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.006
But I gotta talk to you
about something else.

42:12.399 --> 42:15.097
When the M.E. was
conducting the autopsy

42:15.141 --> 42:17.970
on Hideki's body, they
found some foreign DNA.

42:18.013 --> 42:20.494
Now, there's no way to tell
if it was the killer's,

42:20.538 --> 42:21.713
but they ran it anyway.

42:21.756 --> 42:23.105
There was nothing
in the system

42:23.149 --> 42:25.412
that could outright
I.D. this person,

42:25.455 --> 42:28.546
but it did turn up
a familial match.

42:30.504 --> 42:32.158
To you.

42:33.638 --> 42:36.162
What?

42:36.205 --> 42:38.643
How is that even possible?

42:38.686 --> 42:42.690
You had 27 of 111 DNA
markers in common,

42:42.734 --> 42:46.433
showing a close
familial relation.

42:46.476 --> 42:49.610
We also know the sample
came from a female,

42:49.654 --> 42:51.743
roughly 35 to
40 years old.

42:51.786 --> 42:54.920
Adam, you understand what
all this means, right?

42:54.963 --> 42:57.139
I have a half-sister.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.448
And somehow she's involved

43:01.491 --> 43:04.016
in everything that's
been going on.
