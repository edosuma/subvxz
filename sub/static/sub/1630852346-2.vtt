11:45.121 --> 11:47.498
I'm just that method, dawg! I'm method.

11:47.581 --> 11:48.582
[gasps]

11:48.999 --> 11:51.252
-We gotta jump!
-Where?

-[both grunt]

11:54.922 --> 11:55.881

11:56.799 --> 11:58.884
[Cisco] Whoo! Yeah!

11:59.885 --> 12:01.011
Follow them!

12:02.805 --> 12:06.434
[stirring music plays]

12:08.102 --> 12:10.980
We're almost to Echo's truck,
but we only have a couple minutes

12:11.063 --> 12:13.399
before the agency
shuts down my radio interference

12:13.482 --> 12:15.025
and coordinates backup.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.904
-What's our move?
-I'll pass on the right, like... [zooming]

12:18.988 --> 12:22.616
180, into reverse, and grapple
the truck from the front to slow it down.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.162
Cisco can ram the side
as a distraction. [roaring]

12:26.537 --> 12:29.582
[Tony] While Layla sets charges like...
[imitates explosion]

12:29.665 --> 12:32.418
...to bust open the back of the truck
and get Echo out.

12:32.501 --> 12:36.714
Dang, bro! We should use sound effects
in all our planning sessions!

12:36.797 --> 12:38.048
-Can you just go?
-[gasping]

12:38.883 --> 12:40.676
-[engine roars]
-[tires squeal]

12:45.973 --> 12:48.642
Everyone ready? Stay in formation.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.311
Yo, is that Echo?

12:52.021 --> 12:53.647
[grunting]

12:53.731 --> 12:54.899
[horn sounds]

12:59.945 --> 13:00.905
Great timing!

13:01.322 --> 13:02.698
[pants, grunts]

13:04.909 --> 13:07.703
[rhythmic music plays]

13:08.204 --> 13:10.039
Dang, Echo! Nice work.

13:10.456 --> 13:14.043
Yeah, but I'm a little disappointed
we didn't get to do Tony's plan.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.670
Oh, it sounded so cool and loud, like...

13:17.087 --> 13:18.714
Now, we free Ms. Nowhere.

13:19.048 --> 13:23.511
Yeah, about that...
The agency's communications are back up.

13:23.594 --> 13:27.139
[Frostee] Looks like they called in
a convoy to protect Ms. Nowhere's truck.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.517
There are eight spy SUVs boxing her in.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.145
How strongly y'all feel about freeing her?

13:33.521 --> 13:35.272
Layla! She's family.

13:35.731 --> 13:36.982
Just checking.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.276
[hip-hop plays]

13:45.574 --> 13:47.660
Alright. Let's take these guys out.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.045

Nice try. Say hello to the pressure drop.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.035
[tires squeal]

14:32.246 --> 14:36.250
[Ms. Nowhere sniffs, laughs]
You smell that, boys? [laughs]

14:36.333 --> 14:40.170
That's the smell of freedom.
Now, are we gonna do this the easy way...

14:40.629 --> 14:42.381
...or the hard way?

14:42.464 --> 14:45.342
-What is she doing?
-[Ms. Nowhere] Hard way it is!

14:45.426 --> 14:48.137
[yells, groans]

14:48.220 --> 14:51.223
-[laughs]
-[Ms. Nowhere] Ready to give up? [groans]

[groans]

15:16.999 --> 15:19.418
[hip-hop plays]

15:30.179 --> 15:33.432
You challenged the wrong girl
to a street art competition.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.280
[Ms. Nowhere] All right, sense of smell.
You've failed me for the last time.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.408
Sense of taste, you're up! [grunts]

15:51.492 --> 15:53.410
-[guard yells]
-[Ms. Nowhere grunts]

15:58.540 --> 15:59.833
I got this one.

-[muffled bang]

16:13.263 --> 16:17.017
Oh. I barely felt that. [chuckles]

16:20.771 --> 16:23.440
-[Cisco] Dude! [laughs]
-[Layla] Yes! Oh, yeah!

16:23.524 --> 16:25.025
[Echo] Yeah, go Frostee!

16:25.567 --> 16:26.735
Activate laser cannon.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.659
[grunting]

16:37.997 --> 16:39.081
[guard] Ew...

16:39.164 --> 16:40.249
Yeah, right?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.918
[dramatic music plays]

16:46.088 --> 16:47.548
Hop on, Ms. Nowhere!

16:51.301 --> 16:52.344
That's not good.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.513
[Ms. Nowhere shrieks]

16:56.306 --> 16:57.725
We got to get on that truck.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.565
[chuckles] Ejection seat?

17:04.648 --> 17:08.027
Oh heck yeah! I've been looking forward
to trying this one out.

17:14.950 --> 17:15.784
[beeping]

17:16.785 --> 17:20.456
-Yee-haw! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

17:43.270 --> 17:46.315
Hey! How about you watch
where you're punching your guard!

17:46.398 --> 17:49.109
My bad! Trade ya. [grunting]

17:52.613 --> 17:53.864
[guard screams]

17:55.199 --> 17:57.034
[Tony grunting]

17:57.117 --> 17:58.285
Catch up, Toretto!

17:58.368 --> 18:01.246
No fair!
I did most of the work on that guy.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.665
[grunting]

18:03.749 --> 18:05.876
[dramatic music plays]

18:08.295 --> 18:12.716
Is it just me, or does Ms. Nowhere
look, like, really mad?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.510
[scoffs] She always looks mad.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.012
[Frostee] I know, but, like,
madder than usual.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.389
That's definitely her extra-mad face.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.267
Her own agency betrayed her.
What do you expect?

18:22.351 --> 18:24.061
Yeah, that's ice cold, bro.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.606
I bet the agency doesn't even realize
the dark power they've unleashed

18:27.689 --> 18:28.607
by spurning her.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.526
How do you think the Illuminati started?

18:30.609 --> 18:34.196
[Frostee groans] Man, will you stop
talking about the Illuminati?

18:34.655 --> 18:37.533
[Cisco] Yeah, good call.
[whispers] They've got ears everywhere.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.077

-[dramatic music plays]

18:44.832 --> 18:46.291
[guards wail]

18:47.042 --> 18:48.377
You're 0 for 2.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.796
You guys double teamed.
I didn't need any help.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.423
-Stop arguing and get up to that chopper!

-Whoa!

19:12.442 --> 19:13.902
Get a clue.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.578
Huh?

19:30.460 --> 19:32.171
-Toretto!
-Oops!

19:33.505 --> 19:34.923
I got this.

19:36.425 --> 19:40.512
[dramatic music plays]

19:46.059 --> 19:49.605
We've been framed, and you
won't be seeing or hearing from us again

19:49.688 --> 19:51.857
until we find whoever set us up.

19:51.940 --> 19:57.279
And Gary: I'd sleep with one eye open
if I were you. [grunts]

19:58.113 --> 20:02.075
[laughs] That was awesome, Ms. Nowhere!

20:02.159 --> 20:05.245
I can't believe we get to go rogue
with the best of the best!

20:05.829 --> 20:10.125
-This is going to be so fun.
-I've imagined this moment many times.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.794
Stealing a chopper
and taking off for the poles

20:12.878 --> 20:16.089
with nothing but a taser
and a clean pair of underwear.

20:16.173 --> 20:20.594
But I never pictured myself doing it
with a bunch of tweens in tow.

20:20.677 --> 20:25.224
Uh, these "tweens" just broke you out.
Without Frostee, we'd still be separated.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.935
Fine. You get a gold star, Frostee.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.269
Ooh! For real?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.854
Metaphorically.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.523
I feel like you could easily
give him a real gold star.

20:33.607 --> 20:37.736
Yeah, dawg. Go into a sticker store with
10 bucks, you're pretty much set for life.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.821
Fine, I'll get him a gold star

20:39.905 --> 20:42.574
as soon as we're not running
for freedom as we know it!

20:42.658 --> 20:45.619
Now, will you all stop talking?
We need to focus.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.956
The agency will be coming after us
with everything they've got.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.083
If we don't find out who framed us,

20:51.166 --> 20:54.419
we're gonna be living the rest of
our lives looking over our shoulders.

20:54.503 --> 20:59.675
Never knowing which stranger in a café
is the one that holds our death warrants.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.010
I wonder who they'll send after us.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.764
[laughs] It's probably
a small pool to choose from,

21:05.847 --> 21:08.058
since whoever it is
has to be better than me!

21:08.141 --> 21:11.144
[all laugh, whoop]

21:11.228 --> 21:12.896
-[Echo] Woo-hoo-hoo!
-[Layla] Yeah!

21:13.480 --> 21:16.233

with one eye open if I were you.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.616

21:35.585 --> 21:36.712
-[gasps]
-Oh, my.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.171
This is quite an honor.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.799
[quietly] Play it cool, Julius.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.343
-I'm your biggest fan!
-[yelps]

21:43.427 --> 21:46.346
Then you must know
why they call me Palindrome.

21:46.430 --> 21:50.892
Because you always put fugitives
right back where they started.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.436
[in unison] In jail!

21:53.103 --> 21:54.187
That's right.

21:55.397 --> 21:59.401
And this time,
that fugitive is Ms. Nowhere.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.779
I'm bringing her back in,
and you two are gonna help me.
