WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:10.010
(phone ringing)

00:13.513 --> 00:15.582
(Frasier mumbles)

00:21.688 --> 00:22.689
Hello?

00:22.689 --> 00:23.623
MAN:
Dr. Crane?

00:23.623 --> 00:24.491
Yes. Who's this?

00:24.491 --> 00:26.559
Dr. Kaufman.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.596
Bob Kaufman of the National
Psychotherapy Institute.

00:29.596 --> 00:32.866
Oh, my gosh, it's 6:15
in the morning your time.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.734
I hope I didn't wake you.

00:34.734 --> 00:36.136
No, no, no, I was up.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.637
Uh...

00:37.637 --> 00:40.407
Where did you say
you're calling from?

00:40.407 --> 00:42.675
The National
Psychotherapy Institute

00:42.675 --> 00:44.177
in Saddle River,
New Jersey?

00:44.177 --> 00:46.513
Oh, yes, of course.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.848
Uh... what can I do for you?

00:48.848 --> 00:52.218
Oh, for Pete's sake,
no one called you?

00:52.218 --> 00:55.522
You've won our Radio Therapist
of the Year Award.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.923
Congratulations.

00:59.926 --> 01:00.927
Well, thank you.

01:00.927 --> 01:04.397
Uh... of course,
the work itself is honor enough.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.366
Thank you,
and I'm sorry about the mix-up.

01:06.366 --> 01:09.369
Problem is, we're going
to need some pictures of you

01:09.369 --> 01:11.204
so we can get started
on the statue.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.507
"Statue"?

01:14.507 --> 01:16.443
For our Hall of Thinkers?

01:16.443 --> 01:21.014
Angie, he never got the packet.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.016
Uh, is there anything I can do?

01:23.016 --> 01:24.951
Well, it's a little late now

01:24.951 --> 01:27.387
but, uh, maybe if you
described your body

01:27.387 --> 01:29.889
we could get started on
the preliminary carving.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.391
The sculptor's
right here.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.760
Fortunately, we got
the Gustav Brumholt.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.629
Oh, my.

01:36.629 --> 01:39.132
(German accent):
Ja, ja, Dr. Crane, please, ja?

01:39.132 --> 01:40.533
Yes, yes,
this is Dr. Crane speaking.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.902
Uh, Herr Brumholt, may I say
it's, uh, quite an honor.

01:43.436 --> 01:43.937
Ja, ja, ja.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.905
Uh, we have your face--
very handsome--

01:45.905 --> 01:48.374
but I need you
to describe your body.

01:48.374 --> 01:49.776
Yes, of course.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.711
Uh, six foot one...

01:51.711 --> 01:54.114
um... medium build...

01:54.114 --> 01:55.982
broad shoulders...

01:55.982 --> 01:58.885
sublimely proportioned.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.754
That's good, ja,
but before I order my marble

02:01.754 --> 02:03.756
I need you
to describe your, um--

02:03.756 --> 02:05.258
how do I say this, ja, hmm--

02:05.258 --> 02:06.759
your where you sit, ja?

02:06.759 --> 02:08.228
Oh, my posterior.

02:08.228 --> 02:10.263
Yes, well, that is
a little sensitive, isn't it?

02:10.263 --> 02:11.264
Oh, you don't want to tell me?

02:11.264 --> 02:12.265
I understand.

02:12.265 --> 02:13.266
It's a big one?

02:13.266 --> 02:15.268
No, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

02:15.268 --> 02:17.270
Angie, order the big marble,
please, ja.

02:17.270 --> 02:21.274
No, no, no, um, could you
please put Dr. Kaufman back on?

02:21.274 --> 02:23.209
No, I have better idea.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.644
Why don't you send us a picture

02:24.644 --> 02:26.913
(losing accent):
of your immense hind quarters

02:26.913 --> 02:30.183
and send it in
to KACL's new morning team...

02:30.183 --> 02:32.185
BOTH:
Carlos and The Chicken!

02:32.185 --> 02:34.454
(clucking)

02:40.260 --> 02:43.263
Dr. Kaufman?

02:43.263 --> 02:45.265
Angie?

02:53.940 --> 02:54.941
Morning.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.376
Good morning,
Dr. Crane.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.211
You won't believe
what just happened to me.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.346
I was the victim
of a radio prank.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.681
Oh, that's terrible.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.549
Yes.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.417
It's a sad day
when getting a man

03:04.417 --> 03:06.386
to describe his own behind
passes as humor.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.721
(laughing)

03:08.721 --> 03:11.057
You heard the whole thing,
didn't you?

03:11.057 --> 03:12.392
Ja.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.326
Oh...

03:15.328 --> 03:17.797
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane,
but they can be funny.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.265
Oh, that's all right, Daphne.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.768
Carlos and The Chicken
are the sort of performers

03:21.768 --> 03:23.770
who keep popping up
on the radio these days--

03:23.770 --> 03:26.706
so-called "humorists"
who rely on cruel pranks

03:26.706 --> 03:28.107
and scatological references.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.109
Well, I suppose
that's the sort of thing

03:30.109 --> 03:32.111
that passes for entertainment
these days.

03:32.111 --> 03:34.447
You know, perhaps it's
just a generational thing.

03:34.447 --> 03:36.683
Man, they got you good!

03:38.551 --> 03:40.553
The Chicken was on fire!

03:40.553 --> 03:41.988
What a great bit.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.756
Yeah, I think it'll be
bit of the day.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.024
For God sakes,
I'm going back to bed.

03:45.592 --> 03:46.526
Oh, hey, hey, Fras,
wait a minute.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.028
Uh, do you think you can
get me a tape of the show?

03:49.028 --> 03:50.096
What on earth for?

03:50.096 --> 03:51.097
How often do you get

03:51.097 --> 03:52.565
to hear your son
on the radio?

03:55.602 --> 03:57.870
I'm on the radio every day!

04:04.777 --> 04:05.712
Thank you very much.

04:06.279 --> 04:06.713
Hello, Roz.

04:07.213 --> 04:08.281
I suppose you've heard

04:08.281 --> 04:09.782
about my unscheduled
appearance

04:09.782 --> 04:11.584
on KACL's new
morning show today?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.219
No. What happened?

04:13.219 --> 04:15.355
Well, less said
about it, the better.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.623
Come on, Frasier,
why don't you pull up

04:16.623 --> 04:19.524
a couple of chairs
and tell me about it?

04:21.461 --> 04:22.962
Was everyone
in Seattle listening

04:22.962 --> 04:24.397
at 6:00 in the morning?

04:24.397 --> 04:25.331
Did they do it at 6:00?

04:25.331 --> 04:26.733
I heard the replay at 8:00.

04:26.733 --> 04:28.568
I heard it at 9:15.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.404
Congratulations,
you were bit of the day.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.905
Oh, Lord.

04:32.905 --> 04:36.209
I thought the entire thing
was rude and childish.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.511
Well, you're just mad
because you fell for it.

04:38.511 --> 04:39.379
Come on, Frasier--

04:39.379 --> 04:40.747
"Hall of Thinkers"?

04:40.747 --> 04:41.748
Well...

04:41.748 --> 04:43.216
it's not such abadidea.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.719
In a society where we glorify
our athletes and rock musicians,

04:46.719 --> 04:48.221
I think maybe we should...

04:48.721 --> 04:49.722
Well, it was early.

04:49.722 --> 04:50.923
Sorry.

04:50.923 --> 04:53.126
Oh, hey, look, that's them
over there with Kenny.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.328
Wow, The Chicken's
a lot cuter

04:55.328 --> 04:56.663
than on his billboards.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.666
Of course, he's not squatting
in a feather suit

04:59.666 --> 05:01.134
trying to hatch Carlos's head.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.102
You know, I think I
might just go over there

05:03.102 --> 05:04.103
and introduce myself.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.439
I don't know
what you're thinking, but don't.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.274
I'm going to go over
there and let them know

05:08.274 --> 05:10.610
that what they did today was
completely unacceptable.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.944
Frasier,
I know guys like this.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.446
Once they know
they can rattle you,

05:13.446 --> 05:14.447
they never stop.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.948
Just take your lumps
and laugh it off.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.418
Roz, I'm perfectly capable
of laughing it off.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.920
I just want to let them know
that I do not appreciate

05:20.920 --> 05:22.755
being made the punch line
at my own station.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.424
I'm going to go
over and tell them

05:24.424 --> 05:25.758
that from now on,
I don't want

05:25.758 --> 05:27.193
to be part of
their shenanigans.

05:27.193 --> 05:30.396
Oh, God, please don't say
"shenanigans."

05:33.299 --> 05:34.300
Hello, Kenny.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.268
Oh.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.171
I believe introductions
are in order.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.106
Oh, uh, right, uh,
Dr. Frasier Crane,

05:40.106 --> 05:41.607
this is The Chicken
and Carlos.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.009
Uh, uh...
What?

05:43.009 --> 05:45.411
We're actually called
Carlos and The Chicken.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.347
Yes, well,
nice to meet you, boys.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.281
Uh, about this morning...

05:48.781 --> 05:49.582
KENNY::
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:49.582 --> 05:52.819
I don't want to see
any feathers flying, here.

05:52.819 --> 05:53.753
(laughing)

05:53.753 --> 05:54.654
Just kidding.

05:54.654 --> 05:57.156
Dr. Crane, I hope we
didn't go too far.

05:57.156 --> 05:58.091
We love your show.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.492
Really?

05:59.492 --> 06:00.426
You're listeners?

06:00.426 --> 06:01.427
Oh, yeah, yeah,
we're big fans.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.929
You know, the last
thing we want to do

06:02.929 --> 06:04.430
is step on your toes.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.899
Well, you know,
you do tread a fine line

06:06.899 --> 06:08.401
with your style of comedy,

06:08.401 --> 06:10.403
but, uh,
perhaps you can be excused

06:10.403 --> 06:12.405
for stomping on it
rather exuberantly

06:12.405 --> 06:13.373
on your first day.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.742
Just keep in mind
in the future

06:15.742 --> 06:18.411
that this station does have
a certain pecking order.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.245
(laughing)

06:19.245 --> 06:21.247
We totally get it,
Dr. Crane.

06:21.247 --> 06:23.082
I-it felt wrong
when we did it.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.350
Oh, well...
CHICKEN: It sure did.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.752
You sure you're not
upset or anything?

06:25.752 --> 06:26.652
Oh, no, no, no.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.187
No harm, no fowl.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.989
(all laughing)

06:29.989 --> 06:31.791
Hey, it was great
meeting you, Dr. Crane.

06:31.791 --> 06:32.792
Likewise, boys.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.193
Hey, listen,
call me Frasier,

06:34.193 --> 06:36.095
but... don't call me at home.

06:36.095 --> 06:39.332
Dr. Crane,
we're listening.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.600
(laughing)

06:42.101 --> 06:43.102
Well...

06:43.102 --> 06:44.070
Is it over?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.037
I couldn't look.

06:45.037 --> 06:46.873
For God's sake, Roz,
have a little faith in me.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.675
After all, I do reason
with people for a living.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.244
It's all settled.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.180
You know, they're...
they're good kids, really.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.248
(chuckles)

06:55.248 --> 06:57.083
Quite sensible, actually.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.420
Yeah... if you go for oversexed,
beer-belching, frat-boy types,

07:00.887 --> 07:01.921
which I do.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.157
Was The Chicken wearing
a wedding ring?

07:04.157 --> 07:07.293
You know, I really did
overreact this morning, I think.

07:07.293 --> 07:10.430
After all, it was sort
of cute, I suppose.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.431
(chuckling)

07:11.431 --> 07:12.932
"Hall of Thinkers."

07:12.932 --> 07:13.766
(laughing)

07:13.766 --> 07:15.635
Never let it be said
that Frasier Crane is

07:15.635 --> 07:16.636
the kind of man
who's incapable

07:17.136 --> 07:18.137
of laughing at himself.

07:18.137 --> 07:19.138
These are for you.

07:19.138 --> 07:20.540
Oh.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.974
(laughing):
Yes, I see.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.977
Some patron has sent
me some... sticky buns.

07:24.977 --> 07:25.845
(laughing)

07:25.845 --> 07:26.846
That's very funny.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.347
Very funny,
indeed, yes.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.715
You ordered those, sir.

07:29.715 --> 07:30.583
Oh, so I did.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.584
Thank you.

07:37.089 --> 07:38.591
(doorbell rings)

07:39.091 --> 07:40.460
No kidding?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.396
He's flying you to Vegas
for the fight?

07:43.396 --> 07:46.232
That's a great son
you got there, Duke.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.368
Good morning,
Dr. Crane.

07:49.368 --> 07:50.369
Hello, Daphne...

07:50.369 --> 07:51.237
Dad.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.805
Frasier, I thought you might
like to join me.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.307
I'm going down to Abigail's

07:54.307 --> 07:55.708
to have
my crepe pans reseasoned.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.011
Gosh, I'd love to, Niles,

07:59.011 --> 08:00.880
but I've just drawn myself
a nice herbal bath.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.719
Uh, no, no, it's just Daphne.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.588
She's watching PBS.

08:08.588 --> 08:11.858
Okay, I'll talk
to you later, Duke.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.793
Does the whole world
have to know

08:13.793 --> 08:15.294
what goes on in this house?

08:15.294 --> 08:17.296
Help yourself to
some coffee, Niles.

08:17.296 --> 08:18.798
Thank you.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.299
Dr. Crane,
how do you know it's time

08:20.299 --> 08:22.802
to have your crepe
pans seasoned, anyway?

08:22.802 --> 08:25.638
It can be confusing,
but this may help.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.940
"Saucepans in summer,
crepe pans in fall,

08:27.940 --> 08:31.210

08:35.181 --> 08:37.183
Whoever it is, I am not home.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.116
I am not here.

08:40.586 --> 08:41.587
Hello?

08:41.587 --> 08:42.587
Yeah, is Dr. Crane there?

08:42.587 --> 08:44.090
Uh, no, actually,
he's taking a bath.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.091
Who's this?

08:45.091 --> 08:46.592
This is his brother, Niles.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.593
Oh, okay, well, see,

08:47.593 --> 08:49.462
this is
the building superintendent.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.664
I'm in the bathroom
just below his,

08:51.664 --> 08:54.033
and I think the pipes
are getting corroded.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.370
Is your brother putting
anything unusual in his bath?

08:57.370 --> 09:00.273
I'm not exactly sure
what he puts in his bath.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.241
Uh, better let me ask him.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.746
I smell a bit.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.214

it's a proprietary blend, Niles.

09:24.597 --> 09:25.965
No, no, no, it's your super.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.466
There's something corroding
the pipes

09:27.466 --> 09:28.467
in the unit below you.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.802
He thinks it may be something

09:29.802 --> 09:30.636

I use, uh...

09:36.008 --> 09:37.410
(door closes)

09:37.410 --> 09:43.883
...jasmine, lavender, rose hips
and a little Tahitian vanilla.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.885
Yeah, well, that sounds okay.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.353
Boy, with a bath like that,

09:47.353 --> 09:49.221

for you, though, huh?

through the nose.

09:54.627 --> 09:57.430
Hey, you know, the neighbors
down here have been complaining

09:57.430 --> 09:58.831
about a little
sound bleed-through.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.232
I think we got
a bad tile.

10:00.232 --> 10:01.601
I sure would like to check it.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.103
I heard you singing
through the phone earlier.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.572
You think you could,
I don't know, do it again?

10:06.572 --> 10:08.074

10:18.718 --> 10:20.219
You know,
I could isolate the tile

10:20.219 --> 10:21.988
if you could
just walk around

10:21.988 --> 10:23.623
a little bit
while you sang.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.025
Or maybe if you could
stomp around, that'd be great.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.026
"Stomp around"?

10:27.026 --> 10:28.527
If it's too much trouble,

10:28.527 --> 10:30.529
I could send my assistant,
Jimmy, up to stomp around.

out came her camera

12:13.232 --> 12:14.467
like an assassin's blade.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.170
Well, if she wants
to control those blood clots

12:18.170 --> 12:20.573
she'll cough up that film.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.351
Back on the force,

12:32.351 --> 12:34.820
we used to do stuff
like this all the time.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.856
We'd fill a guy's hat
with shaving cream

12:36.856 --> 12:38.224
or nail his shoes
to the floor.

12:38.224 --> 12:41.127
Sometimes we'd get a guy
dead drunk and then leave him

12:41.127 --> 12:42.628

12:47.233 --> 12:49.068
I might have been able
to laugh it off

12:49.068 --> 12:53.472
if all of Seattle hadn't started
stalking me with cameras.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.342
Quickly, Niles, inside!
Come on!

12:56.342 --> 12:58.778
Why didn't you hold
the elevator?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.279
Didn't you hear me shouting?

13:00.279 --> 13:01.247
That was you?

13:01.247 --> 13:02.748
I'm sorry, Niles.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.750
I was afraid you were trying
to get a picture of my butt.

13:07.253 --> 13:11.590
How exciting to be present
at the birth of a new phobia.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.960
I'm talking about Carlos
and The Chicken.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.462
Oh, yes, their
little contest.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.964
I can't believe anyone's
taking that seriously.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.733
Well, they won't be
for much longer.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.002
I've decided it's
time to fight back.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.937
I was up till all
hours last night

13:24.937 --> 13:27.506
crafting my response
to those two idiots.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.008
I believe I
have arrived

13:29.008 --> 13:30.342
at a masterful
rebuttal.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.978
I'm not sure you want
to call it your rebuttal.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.382
Oh, I see your
Bartlett's is out.

13:36.382 --> 13:38.384
You're not pulling
any punches.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.285
Hardly.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.654
I go in swinging
with La Rochefoucauld.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.155
"If we had no faults
of our own

13:43.155 --> 13:45.124
"we would not take
so much pleasure

13:45.124 --> 13:46.625
in noticing those of others."

13:46.625 --> 13:48.093
Ouch!

13:48.093 --> 13:49.361
Mm-hmm.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.565
Just as I've got
them reeling,

13:52.565 --> 13:54.066
I go in with a jab
of Dorothy Parker:

13:54.066 --> 13:56.068
"Wit has truth in it;

13:56.068 --> 13:59.572
wisecracking is merely
calisthenics with words."

13:59.572 --> 14:00.539
Pow!

14:00.539 --> 14:02.007
Just as they're
bloodied

14:02.007 --> 14:04.243
and against the ropes,
I go in for the kill

14:04.243 --> 14:07.346
with Twain, Wilde, Twain,
Twain, Mencken!

14:07.346 --> 14:10.115
It's not a fight,
it's an execution!

14:10.115 --> 14:12.117
You know, Frasier,

14:12.117 --> 14:13.619
you go and read that
on the air,

14:13.619 --> 14:15.120
you're going to set
yourself up

14:15.120 --> 14:16.121
for a year
of abuse.

14:16.121 --> 14:17.623
You know, this kind of
thing is probably why

14:17.623 --> 14:18.624
those guys started
picking on you

14:19.124 --> 14:20.125
in the first place.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.127
All right, fine, Dad,
what exactly are you saying?

14:22.127 --> 14:24.930
That I somehow managed to bring
this misery on myself?

14:24.930 --> 14:27.233
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm just...

14:27.233 --> 14:29.768
have you ever wondered
why these bullies have

14:29.768 --> 14:31.770
always kind of zeroed in
on you two?

14:31.770 --> 14:33.272
No, we don't wonder why.

14:33.272 --> 14:34.273
We know the reason.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.674
Jealousy.
Jealousy.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.077
Okay, there's a little bit
of that, too

14:38.077 --> 14:41.080
but, you know, you kind of give
people the impression

14:41.080 --> 14:42.414
that you're above them.

14:42.414 --> 14:43.249
Pishtosh.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.250
Poppycock.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.252

14:46.252 --> 14:47.753
Oh, Daphne, tell me,

14:47.753 --> 14:50.155
do you think we're snobby,
superior and condescending?

14:50.155 --> 14:51.056
That's it.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.892
I'm getting me door
soundproofed.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.527
MARTIN:
You see what I mean?

14:55.527 --> 14:57.863
People think you're stuffy,
you know,

14:57.863 --> 15:00.833
with your opera parties
and your wine parties

15:00.833 --> 15:02.801
and your seasoned crepe pans.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.737
In my defense,
Niles is the only one

15:05.237 --> 15:07.106
who has ever seasoned
his crepe pans.

15:07.106 --> 15:09.508
Which is precisely why
I've had the same set

15:09.508 --> 15:11.977
since the ninth grade,
thank you very much.

15:13.879 --> 15:17.182
My point is, you guys could
never resist putting on airs.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.951
Even when you were
in junior high,

15:18.951 --> 15:21.320
you used to love that TV
program, The Avengers.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.589
Used to run all over
the neighborhood

15:23.589 --> 15:26.325
pretending you were that guy
with the umbrella, Steve.

15:26.325 --> 15:27.326
Steed.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.727
Dad...
Oh, God.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.896
FRASIER:
There were worse role models.

15:30.896 --> 15:32.197
Steed was dapper
and witty.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.699
When anyone tried
to give him grief,

15:34.199 --> 15:36.502
he gave them a sound
thrashing with his umbrella.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.304
Great. That's fine.
Admire him if you want,

15:38.304 --> 15:40.306
but did you have to run
through the neighborhood

15:40.806 --> 15:41.774
in bowler hats?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.209
You were just begging
to get beat up.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.644
Come to think of it,

15:45.644 --> 15:47.579
it was rather a rough summer
that year, wasn't it?

15:47.579 --> 15:49.515
I remember getting
a chin strap

15:49.515 --> 15:51.951
so the bowler wouldn't fall off
when I ran.

15:53.852 --> 15:55.854
And all that did was make you

15:55.854 --> 15:58.324
look like Elizabeth Taylor
in National Velvet.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.759
But, look,

16:00.759 --> 16:02.628
my point is,

16:02.628 --> 16:04.997
you go down to the station
and read that over the air,

16:04.997 --> 16:06.932
then you might as
well go down there

16:06.932 --> 16:08.334
in a great big bowler hat.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.602
Those people are never going
to let you forget it.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.805
It's funny hearing you
talk about The Avengers.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.673
My first Halloween in America,

16:14.673 --> 16:16.642
I went to a party
dressed as Mrs. Peel.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.143
Head to toe

16:18.143 --> 16:20.012
in that skintight black
leather cat suit.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.347
Come to think of it,

16:21.347 --> 16:22.648
I still have
it somewhere

16:22.648 --> 16:23.449
and Halloween's coming up.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.250
Cat suit.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.552
Better not let this guy
hear you talk about that

16:26.552 --> 16:27.820
or he'll go nuts.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.555
I would not...

16:34.226 --> 16:37.663
...be surprised
if he did.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.598
(chuckles)

16:39.598 --> 16:41.433
(phone rings)

16:41.433 --> 16:42.301
FRASIER:

16:42.801 --> 16:43.802
Hello.

16:43.802 --> 16:45.304
All right, Roz, yes.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.705
Just calm down.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.874
No, no, I'm not listening.
Hang on a second.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.510
FRASIER (on radio): Roz...
(erotic moaning)

16:51.510 --> 16:53.278
Oh, dear God.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.547
CARLOS: I think we're going
to have to throw

16:55.547 --> 16:57.349
a bucket of water on these two.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.854
Next thing you know,
they're getting it on

17:01.854 --> 17:03.355
right in the booth!

17:03.355 --> 17:04.256
FRASIER:
Roz!

17:04.256 --> 17:05.691
ROZ:
Frasier.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.592
Roz.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.359
Frasier.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.628
Do we have time to squeeze
in one more?

17:10.628 --> 17:12.498
Plenty of time, Frasier.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.867
Two more minutes.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.736
For a man carrying around
a good 50 extra pounds of ass,

17:17.736 --> 17:20.239
Frasier Crane has got
unbelievable stamina.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.107
Frasier, where do you get
your energy?

17:22.107 --> 17:25.477
FRASIER: Lavender, rose hips,
and a little Tahitian vanilla.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.246
CARLOS:
Oh, my God!

17:27.246 --> 17:28.513
They're changing
positions.

17:28.513 --> 17:30.249
I've never seen
that one before.

17:30.249 --> 17:34.853
FRASIER: Love does enter
through the nose.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.555
(erotic moaning continues)

17:36.555 --> 17:38.791
FRASIER:
I'll call you back, Roz.

17:38.791 --> 17:39.591
I'm going down there.

17:39.591 --> 17:40.592
MARTIN:
Frasier!

17:40.592 --> 17:42.094
Dad, don't try to talk
me out of this.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.096
I'm going to teach
those two a lesson

17:44.096 --> 17:45.597
they'll not soon forget.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.365
Where's my umbrella?

17:46.365 --> 17:47.733
Oh, no, not that again!

17:47.733 --> 17:50.035
Not the umbrella!
I'm begging you!

17:50.035 --> 17:51.804
It's raining!

17:51.804 --> 17:53.338
No! No! Stop!

17:57.376 --> 17:58.377
Roz, what are you
doing here?

17:58.877 --> 18:00.379
I'm getting revenge,
that's what.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.381
These guys are going down!

18:02.381 --> 18:03.382
Stop it.
Stop it, Roz.

18:03.382 --> 18:04.883
Did you hear
the disgusting,

18:04.883 --> 18:06.785
vile things they
said about me?

18:06.785 --> 18:08.187
Just the part
about us having sex.

18:08.187 --> 18:09.988
Exactly!

18:09.988 --> 18:10.789
Not only that.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.625
They've got a photo
contest about me now, too.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.427
Roz, a thousand dollars
for a shot of your behind?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.395
I'm sorry, Roz.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.364
No, it's 50 bucks
and a six pack.

18:19.364 --> 18:20.365
And there were
seven winners

18:20.866 --> 18:22.167
before I even
left the house!

18:22.167 --> 18:22.968
I'm sorry.

18:22.968 --> 18:23.969
Frasier, what
should we do?

18:23.969 --> 18:25.304
Could we slash
their tires?

18:25.304 --> 18:26.638
Could we crack
their windshields?

18:26.638 --> 18:28.307
I was thinking
of a more direct approach.

18:28.307 --> 18:29.308
Oh, I'm down with that, too.

18:29.308 --> 18:30.809
Next commercial,
I'll get The Chicken,

18:30.809 --> 18:31.777
you take the big guy.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.712
No, no, no, that's not it
and you know it, Roz!

18:33.712 --> 18:35.214
I knew you'd say that.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.215
Fine. I'll take
the big guy!

18:36.215 --> 18:37.983
No, no, Roz, stop it!
Listen to yourself!

18:37.983 --> 18:40.185
You're lusting for blood
like a barbarian!

18:40.185 --> 18:42.888
I have a more civilized
approach in mind.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.857
I have composed a speech.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.661
A speech?
Yes.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.029
Unless you plan
to roll it up

18:51.029 --> 18:52.531
and cram it down
their throats,

18:52.531 --> 18:54.032
what good is that
going to do?

18:54.032 --> 18:55.033
You just watch and see.
No, Frasier.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.536
They're never going to stop
making fun of you.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.537
Roz, I don't care.

18:58.537 --> 18:59.905
I've just figured
out something.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.274
Maybe you can't stop
bullies from attacking you,

19:02.274 --> 19:03.275
but the only way they win

19:03.275 --> 19:04.776
is if they change
who you are,

19:04.776 --> 19:06.278
and I'll tell
you something.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.279
Let them do their worst.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.214
They will not knock
the bowler off this head!

19:10.649 --> 19:13.519
What does that mean?!

19:13.519 --> 19:16.755
Holy cow! Look who just
walked into the booth,

19:16.755 --> 19:19.491
Frasier Crane,
the automatic sex pilot.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.126
What's up, love doctor?

19:21.126 --> 19:22.895
Oh, I think you
two know what's up.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.796
There's only so much
I can take.

19:24.796 --> 19:27.166
Only so much anyone can take
from a juvenile comic

19:27.166 --> 19:28.934
and his straight man!

19:28.934 --> 19:30.702
I believe it was
La Rochefoucauld...

19:30.702 --> 19:32.137
I'll take my straight man

19:32.137 --> 19:34.640
over your sex-starved producer
any day, my friend.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.641
Okay, buddy!

19:35.641 --> 19:38.410
Roz, let me handle this!

19:38.410 --> 19:39.178
Hey, hey,
wait a second.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.679
I'm not your
straight man.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.181
If anything,
I'm the funny one.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.682
Let's not start
this again, okay?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.150
You're the one who
started it on the air.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.619
It was La Rochefoucauld
who first said...

19:47.619 --> 19:48.620
You always do this.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.622
Hey, Carlos,
the therapist said

19:50.622 --> 19:52.424
not to use the word
"always."

19:52.424 --> 19:53.759
I just wish that
you could say

19:53.759 --> 19:54.760
that I'm as
funny as you are.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.261
I wish I could
say that, too,

19:56.261 --> 19:57.596
but who does
all the funny voices?

19:57.596 --> 19:58.931
La Rochefoucauld once said...

19:58.931 --> 20:00.199
If I'm so unfunny,

20:00.199 --> 20:01.466
how come I get
offered solo gigs?

20:01.466 --> 20:02.968
Oh, well, now
I'm laughing! Ha-ha!

20:02.968 --> 20:03.936
Don't believe me?

20:03.936 --> 20:05.470
Ask our agent.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.272
You talked to Zachary
behind my back?

20:07.272 --> 20:08.574
Gentlemen, if I could
get a word in here...

20:08.574 --> 20:09.575
I tell you what, man.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.076
You think you can go out
on your own,

20:11.076 --> 20:12.377
go ahead, be my guest.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.679
Great! 'Cause I
don't need you,

20:13.679 --> 20:16.081
and I don't need
"Carlos and The Chicken"!

20:16.081 --> 20:16.982
CHICKEN:
Oh, really?

20:16.982 --> 20:18.283
Well, best of
luck, funny boy.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.118
Same to you, Dwayne!

20:20.118 --> 20:22.621
Hey, man, that is not cool.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.056
Chicken, I believe

20:24.056 --> 20:25.958
it was La Rochefoucauld,
the great French thinker...

20:25.958 --> 20:27.926
Would you give it a rest,
double-wide.

20:27.926 --> 20:28.927
I went to grad school, too.

20:28.927 --> 20:30.395
And P.S.:

20:30.395 --> 20:32.731
It's pronounced
La Rochefoucauld.

20:32.731 --> 20:33.932
That's it!

20:33.932 --> 20:35.834
Nobody corrects
my French pronunciation...!

20:37.636 --> 20:39.404
Chicken!

20:39.404 --> 20:41.306
Oh, my God, did you
have to be so vicious?

20:41.306 --> 20:42.140
Me?

20:42.140 --> 20:43.008
Oh, we got dead air.

20:43.008 --> 20:44.009
Just take over.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.510
Right. Right.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.511
Hello, Seattle.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.013
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.015
I'll be filling in
for the last hour

20:50.015 --> 20:53.018
of The Morning Zoo

20:53.018 --> 20:58.490
with my own particular brand
of zany antics.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.025
Well, let's see. Um...

21:00.025 --> 21:04.029
ah, you know, there was
a fabulous cartoon

21:04.029 --> 21:06.531
in the recent New Yorker.

21:06.531 --> 21:09.034
Let me see if I can describe it
for you.

21:14.573 --> 21:17.042
♪ Hey, baby,
I hear the blues a'callin' ♪

21:17.042 --> 21:20.012
♪ Tossed salads

21:20.012 --> 21:21.446

21:21.446 --> 21:23.415

21:23.415 --> 21:26.885

21:26.885 --> 21:28.854

21:28.854 --> 21:30.355

21:30.355 --> 21:34.693

21:38.196 --> 21:41.500
Scrambled eggs all over my face.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.404
What is a boy to do?

21:45.404 --> 21:48.140
Good night!
