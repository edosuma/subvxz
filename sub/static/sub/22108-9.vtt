00:20.141 --> 00:21.289
Ah, recess.

00:21.314 --> 00:22.953
When a man can pursue his passions.

00:22.978 --> 00:25.625
Like taking this bush from
shrubba to hubba hubba.

00:25.648 --> 00:27.781
Yup. Nothin' like a few
minutes in the old yard

00:27.816 --> 00:29.816
before they put us back in lock-up.

00:29.885 --> 00:32.085
Or in health class. You and
I have different schedules.

00:32.154 --> 00:35.122
Hey guys. Wow, Gene, your shrub
sculpture's really coming along.

00:35.191 --> 00:37.491
Uh, Rudy, the shrub
sculpture has a name.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.359
Monkey Booby Man.

00:39.428 --> 00:41.128
Oh, yeah, I'm starting to see it.

00:41.197 --> 00:42.429
There's the monkey's face.

00:42.498 --> 00:43.708
And there's the monkey's boobs.

00:43.732 --> 00:45.098
I thought those were his boobs?

00:45.134 --> 00:46.667
Calm down, you're both right.

00:46.735 --> 00:48.835
Where were you last
recess, Rudy? We missed ya.

00:48.904 --> 00:51.205
Oh. I tried to play basketball.

00:51.273 --> 00:53.440
Nope. Negative.

00:53.509 --> 00:54.875
No, sir.

00:54.944 --> 00:56.810
Anyway, you got any extra scissors?

00:56.879 --> 00:57.978
Take these nail clippers.

00:58.047 --> 00:59.513
Monkey Booby manicure.

00:59.538 --> 01:02.203
Can I have everyone's
attention, please? Hello.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.160
Ugh. What does Mr. Frond want?

01:04.185 --> 01:05.686
This is my recess.

01:05.754 --> 01:09.056
Hello! I'm not just gonna
go away if you ignore me.

01:09.124 --> 01:11.225
- Listen up.
- Thank you.

01:11.293 --> 01:13.126
Students of Wagstaff.

01:13.195 --> 01:15.062
It's time to face facts.

01:15.130 --> 01:17.197
Recess is broken.

01:17.266 --> 01:19.333
Look around at this
playground. What do you see?

01:19.401 --> 01:22.069
Two third-graders
playing catch with a shoe.

01:22.137 --> 01:23.804
Those little boys who
pretend to be cats,

01:23.872 --> 01:25.239
like that's even a game.

01:25.274 --> 01:27.307
Why do your own thing

01:27.376 --> 01:30.167
when you could all be doing
the same thing together?

01:30.192 --> 01:32.722
I'm here today to present
an exciting opportunity

01:32.747 --> 01:34.014
for togetherness.

01:34.049 --> 01:36.016
Boys and girls, I give you...

01:36.085 --> 01:38.752
- Ga-Ga ball.
- Ga-Ga what?

01:38.821 --> 01:41.488
You know, this really could
have been covered in an e-mail.

01:41.557 --> 01:43.653
Ga-Ga ball. It's a game.

01:43.678 --> 01:45.259
Wait. So it's a game?

01:45.327 --> 01:47.227
- Yes, it's a game.
- Oh.

01:47.296 --> 01:48.996
The best thing about Ga-Ga ball

01:49.031 --> 01:51.065
is there's no catching and no throwing.

01:51.090 --> 01:54.690
Anyone can play, no matter how
hopelessly un-athletic they are.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.070
Um, why are you looking
at me when you say that?

01:57.139 --> 01:58.739
I wasn't looking at you,

01:58.807 --> 02:00.707
- I was looking with you.
- What?

02:00.776 --> 02:02.909
Come, children. Follow me into the pit.

02:02.978 --> 02:05.078
That's not a terrifying invitation.

02:05.147 --> 02:08.669
Think of Ga-Ga ball as
dodge-ball, but gentler.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.917
In dodge-ball, you hurl
the ball at your opponent.

02:10.953 --> 02:13.365
In Ga-Ga, you just slap the ball.

02:13.390 --> 02:14.721
Anyone can slap.

02:14.790 --> 02:16.506
- Can I slap?
- You tell me.

02:16.531 --> 02:19.393
Oh, my God, I can slap.

02:19.461 --> 02:21.261
Now, to get someone out in Ga-Ga ball,

02:21.330 --> 02:23.787
you must hit them on or below the knee,

02:23.812 --> 02:24.865
where it doesn't hurt.

02:24.933 --> 02:26.566
What happens if I power-slam the ball

02:26.635 --> 02:28.217
into someone's nose or butter-beans?

02:28.242 --> 02:30.370
- That's not allowed, Zeke.
- Seems weird.

02:30.439 --> 02:32.272
The last one in the pit wins.

02:32.341 --> 02:34.190
Maybe the best way to demonstrate is

02:34.215 --> 02:35.760
to play a couple rounds, huh?

02:35.785 --> 02:36.943
Who wants to join me?

02:37.012 --> 02:38.745
- Do we have to?
- Well, strictly speaking,

02:38.814 --> 02:41.214
- you don't have to, but...
- Oh, great, okay, buh-bye.

02:46.426 --> 02:48.055
O... Kay.

02:48.123 --> 02:49.756
Hey, wait a minute, I know you.

02:49.825 --> 02:51.303
Aren't you the guy
that reads to the kids

02:51.327 --> 02:52.559
down at the public library?

02:52.628 --> 02:53.760
The Wizard of Books, right?

02:53.829 --> 02:56.129
Abraca-books!

02:56.198 --> 02:58.298
- "Abraca-books."
- Hi, my name is Frank.

02:58.367 --> 03:01.802
That must be so much fun,
reading to kids... I'm jealous.

03:01.870 --> 03:03.170
- So, you reading today?
- Yep.

03:03.238 --> 03:04.738
Twice a week, every week.

03:04.773 --> 03:07.474
I'm so nice, they let
me read twice... a week.

03:07.509 --> 03:09.743
Oh...

03:09.812 --> 03:11.144
And you're heading there now?

03:11.180 --> 03:13.246
Or maybe this is how you always dress.

03:13.315 --> 03:15.615
I am heading there, and
they don't let me change

03:15.684 --> 03:17.484
behind the periodicals anymore.

03:17.553 --> 03:19.152
Too bad I'm gonna miss Friday's reading.

03:19.221 --> 03:20.654
I'm going out of town.

03:20.723 --> 03:22.522
So that's it? Story time's canceled?

03:22.591 --> 03:24.324
For a lot of those kids, and some adults

03:24.393 --> 03:26.126
who can hear from the biography section,

03:26.195 --> 03:27.494
story time is all they have.

03:27.563 --> 03:28.995
I could fill in for you.

03:29.064 --> 03:30.263
Hey, there you go.

03:30.332 --> 03:31.832
I could come up with a character

03:31.900 --> 03:33.934
and pick out a story...
Oh, my mind's racing.

03:33.969 --> 03:36.870
Okay, sure. Story time
is at 2:00 on Friday.

03:36.939 --> 03:38.772
I can tell the librarian to expect...

03:38.841 --> 03:40.440
um, uh, what's your name?

03:40.509 --> 03:44.311
Linda. Uh, aka The Duchess of Tales.

03:44.346 --> 03:46.046
- Hmm.
- Actually, no, not that.

03:46.115 --> 03:48.048
Um, how about

03:48.117 --> 03:50.450
Wanda... Wordmouth?

03:50.519 --> 03:52.452
She's got a mouth full of, uh, words?

03:52.521 --> 03:54.269
- Mm...
- I'll keep thinking.

03:56.625 --> 03:57.858
Lunch is great today.

03:57.926 --> 03:59.326
The canned corn must be in season.

03:59.395 --> 04:01.039
Hurry up and eat so we
can hit the playground.

04:01.063 --> 04:02.433
It's shrub o'clock.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.342
We can make up that time
we lost listening to Frond.

04:04.366 --> 04:06.533
What is it with him trying
to get his Frond stink

04:06.602 --> 04:07.901
all over the playground, anyway?

04:07.970 --> 04:09.469
The playground's bigger than him.

04:09.538 --> 04:11.371
The playground doesn't
change for anybody.

04:11.407 --> 04:13.807
Ga-Ga ball!

04:13.876 --> 04:16.076
What the hell? Everyone's
playing Ga-Ga ball.

04:16.144 --> 04:18.043
Oh, my God, you like this.

04:18.113 --> 04:19.245
You really like this.

04:19.314 --> 04:20.514
This can't be working.

04:20.548 --> 04:22.215
It's a Frond idea.

04:22.284 --> 04:24.551
He has 'em, they're bad,
we ignore 'em, the end.

04:24.620 --> 04:26.553
Yeah, remember Eye Contact Mondays?

04:26.622 --> 04:29.156
Hey, guys, I'm hitting the
Ga-Ga pit... you wanna come?

04:29.224 --> 04:31.024
Rudy, it's so funny, I thought you said

04:31.093 --> 04:32.759
you were hitting the Ga-Ga pit.

04:32.828 --> 04:35.162
I am. I played at recess. I almost won.

04:35.197 --> 04:37.264
I think I might actually
be kind of good at it.

04:37.332 --> 04:39.310
- I can't believe it.
- Forget it, sister.

04:39.334 --> 04:41.446
Let them play with their balls.
We'll play with our bushes.

04:41.470 --> 04:43.203
- Right, right.
- Yeah, we're Belchers.

04:43.272 --> 04:44.592
We don't give in to peer pressure.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.572
Hey, Tina, we're gonna play Ga-Ga ball.

04:45.641 --> 04:47.007
- You wanna come?
- Yes.

04:47.042 --> 04:48.787
Uh, I-I just want to see
what the fuss is about.

04:48.811 --> 04:50.777
I'll probably hate it.
See you soon.

04:50.846 --> 04:52.846
She'll be back. If I know our Tina,

04:52.915 --> 04:55.215
she's feeling pretty
silly right about now.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.828
I love
it. I'm staying. Sorry.

04:56.852 --> 04:59.252
- Give it a minute.
- I just keep loving it more and more.

04:59.321 --> 05:01.455
- Not looking good.
- I finally feel alive.

05:01.523 --> 05:03.651
I guess she kinda likes it.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.486
Everybody's into Ga-Ga ball.

05:06.555 --> 05:08.837
This thing blew up,
literally, overnight.

05:08.862 --> 05:11.896
Yeah, like when mom left that
bottle of beer in the freezer.

05:11.965 --> 05:13.465
Oh, hi, guys. Grab a seat.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.300
We're talking about
Jimmy Jr.'s Ga-Ga moves.

05:15.369 --> 05:16.801
I've got great dodging moves.

05:16.870 --> 05:19.070
- I'm like the Artful Dodger.
- Dickens!

05:20.440 --> 05:22.540
Heh, look at that. Look at that air.

05:22.609 --> 05:24.042
Zeke's not so good, though.

05:24.077 --> 05:25.977
Oh, man, that was candid, J-Ju.

05:26.046 --> 05:27.924
Gonna have to stew on
that one for a second, heh.

05:27.948 --> 05:30.715
You slap hard, Zeke, but
your aim is really bad.

05:30.784 --> 05:33.752
Whoa. Again, very
blunt. Not holding back.

05:33.820 --> 05:37.122
Can we talk about something
besides Ga-Ga ball, please?

05:37.190 --> 05:39.391
Sure. Um, remind me, uh,

05:39.459 --> 05:41.226
what did we talk about
before Ga-Ga ball?

05:41.295 --> 05:43.495
Ugh, come on, Gene. We can eat our lunch

05:43.563 --> 05:45.830
hunched over a trashcan
somewhere, like Dad does.

05:45.899 --> 05:47.899
That was gonna be my
first choice anyway.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.801
Lin, could you take that to table four?

05:49.870 --> 05:51.403
Uh, can you do it? We're brainstorming

05:51.438 --> 05:53.004
on my story time character.

05:53.073 --> 05:55.607
Yup, I'll just do all the
jobs in our restaurant.

05:55.642 --> 05:56.642
Sounds good.

05:56.677 --> 05:58.076
Ooh, ooh, I got one.

05:58.145 --> 06:00.185
I'll dress like a librarian,
and when the kids come,

06:00.247 --> 06:02.781
I'll shake out my hair and
I'll take off my glasses,

06:02.849 --> 06:05.483
and I'll say, "Gotcha!
I'm the storyteller."

06:05.552 --> 06:07.018
That's a hurtful stereotype, Linda.

06:07.054 --> 06:09.287
Not all librarians want
to shake their hair out.

06:09.356 --> 06:10.755
Yeah, you're right.

06:10.824 --> 06:12.791
Ooh, maybe Ill get body-painted

06:12.859 --> 06:14.659
like a shelf of books,
and then stand quietly

06:14.728 --> 06:16.094
in front of some other books.

06:16.129 --> 06:17.473
And just when the kids don't expect it,

06:17.497 --> 06:18.663
I'll jump out and I'll say,

06:18.732 --> 06:20.298
"Gotcha! Stories come to life."

06:20.367 --> 06:22.033
Uh, why do all your ideas involve

06:22.069 --> 06:23.968
shouting "gotcha" and scaring children?

06:24.037 --> 06:26.304
Wh-Wha... 'Cause I wanna surprise them.

06:26.373 --> 06:29.507
Kids ask, "Rudy, how are
you so good at Ga-Ga?"

06:29.576 --> 06:32.043
I tell 'em focus, diet, conditioning.

06:32.112 --> 06:34.312
I mean, honestly, genetics plays a part.

06:36.149 --> 06:37.816
- Is that Rudy?
- Yeah.

06:37.892 --> 06:40.226
Why does he have Matthew
McConaughey's body language?

06:40.287 --> 06:41.319
Hey, Zeke, think fast.

06:41.388 --> 06:43.121
Oh! Oh, man, you got me.

06:43.190 --> 06:44.289
You heading to the pit?

06:44.358 --> 06:45.724
I'll go easy on you this time.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.559
In your dreams.

06:47.627 --> 06:49.937
Hey, no shame in losing
to the best, right?

06:49.962 --> 06:52.030
- Well, some shame.
- Hey, guys.

06:52.099 --> 06:54.032
Rudy, you in there, buddy?

06:54.067 --> 06:56.868
What? I finally found a sport
I dominate in, that's all.

06:56.937 --> 06:58.970
You guys should play. You would love it.

06:59.005 --> 07:00.839
Ugh, I wish people would stop telling us

07:00.907 --> 07:02.340
to play Ga-Ga ball.

07:02.409 --> 07:03.641
Yeah, no thanks.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.021
We have our own playground interests.

07:05.045 --> 07:06.177
Oh, like Monkey Booby Man?

07:06.246 --> 07:07.679
Yeah, sure, he's cool.

07:07.748 --> 07:09.080
But you know what's really cool?

07:09.149 --> 07:10.882
Winning. And right now,

07:10.951 --> 07:13.351
nobody does that quite
like the Rudester.

07:13.387 --> 07:14.686
Okay, you need to shut that down.

07:14.755 --> 07:16.388
"Rudester" can never be said again.

07:16.456 --> 07:18.434
Let me put this in terms
you'll appreciate, Louise.

07:18.458 --> 07:20.992
In Ga-Ga ball, you gotta hit
people below the knee, right?

07:21.061 --> 07:22.527
If you say so.

07:22.596 --> 07:23.906
For kids like us, that doesn't leave

07:23.930 --> 07:25.142
much of a target.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.165
I'm smokin' suckers twice my size,

07:27.234 --> 07:29.434
but when they come at me, I'm a phantom.

07:29.503 --> 07:31.870
Meh, I still don't think I'd be into it.

07:31.938 --> 07:33.905
- Ha!
- Ah. Oh, man.

07:33.974 --> 07:36.341
Oh, my God, you're
right. This is amazing!

07:36.410 --> 07:39.210
More eight-graders. Send
me more eighth-graders!

07:39.279 --> 07:41.546
- Eat that for supper!
- Geez, Tina.

07:41.615 --> 07:42.947
Snap, crackle, pop, fool.

07:43.016 --> 07:44.249
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

07:44.317 --> 07:45.850
Ow. Never mind, I'm out. Disregard.

07:45.919 --> 07:47.218
Guess it's just you and me, now,

07:47.287 --> 07:48.620
monkey booby buddy.

07:48.688 --> 07:50.522
What's that? You want another boob?

07:50.590 --> 07:51.923
All you gotta do is ask.

07:52.759 --> 07:54.125
Kids, what's your favorite story

07:54.194 --> 07:55.126
I used to read to you?

07:55.151 --> 07:56.862
I gotta pick a book for the library.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.229
Well, The Giving Tree

07:58.298 --> 07:59.409
messed me up pretty good, so not that.

07:59.433 --> 08:00.532
Can you read them TV?

08:00.600 --> 08:02.033
I remember liking that a lot.

08:02.102 --> 08:03.568
Anyway, Ga-Ga ball!

08:03.637 --> 08:06.037
Tina, top five Ga-Ga
plays of the day... go.

08:06.106 --> 08:07.472
Oh, my God, where to begin.

08:07.541 --> 08:09.240
What's Ga-Ga ball?

08:09.276 --> 08:11.409
- Uh, the best game?
- It's the people's sport.

08:11.478 --> 08:12.710
Try to keep up, Dad.

08:12.779 --> 08:14.379
So you kids are playing a sport now?

08:14.448 --> 08:15.448
How'd that happen?

08:15.482 --> 08:16.614
The whole school is playing.

08:16.683 --> 08:18.283
Yeah, basically everyone but Gene.

08:18.351 --> 08:19.984
- Gene, you should play.
- You should.

08:20.053 --> 08:21.619
- You'd love it.
- I love it.

08:21.688 --> 08:23.199
I didn't think I'd
love it, but I love it.

08:23.223 --> 08:24.789
Maybe I would love it,

08:24.825 --> 08:26.769
but the playground used to
be the one place in school

08:26.793 --> 08:28.004
where you could do what you want,

08:28.028 --> 08:29.594
and right now, all I want to do is

08:29.663 --> 08:31.129
work on my special project.

08:31.164 --> 08:32.831
No offense, but how much longer

08:32.899 --> 08:34.458
are you gonna spend trimming that shrub?

08:34.501 --> 08:36.100
I can't help it if I keep coming up

08:36.169 --> 08:37.735
with amazing new ideas for him.

08:37.804 --> 08:39.904
Like giving him a pet
fern named "Fern-Ando."

08:39.972 --> 08:41.405
It's not my fault I'm a genius!

08:41.475 --> 08:42.941
All right, all right, calm down.

08:43.009 --> 08:44.187
You know what calms me right down?

08:44.211 --> 08:45.176
A round of Ga-Ga?

08:45.212 --> 08:46.611
- Bingo.
- Mm-hmm.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.012
Ahh! First it's all anybody

08:48.081 --> 08:49.247
can talk about at school,

08:49.316 --> 08:51.082
and now it's in my home,

08:51.151 --> 08:53.818
where I lay my sweet head?!

08:53.887 --> 08:55.987
Wow, Gene left his food on the table.

08:56.012 --> 08:57.655
- He must really be upset.
- Yeah.

08:57.691 --> 08:59.845
In my home!

09:01.828 --> 09:04.462
Ahh. Oh, no.

09:04.531 --> 09:06.097
We have a winner.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.265
Wayne, go... go, go, go.

09:07.334 --> 09:08.334
Get out, get out.

09:08.368 --> 09:09.300
I'm going.

09:09.369 --> 09:10.301
I'm just picking up

09:10.370 --> 09:11.603
the pieces of my glasses.

09:11.671 --> 09:13.004
Not fast enough, you're not.

09:13.029 --> 09:15.095
Any words for your fellow competitors?

09:15.120 --> 09:17.354
No shame in losing to the best.

09:17.379 --> 09:18.987
I love it when he says that.

09:19.012 --> 09:21.112
Chills. Rudy, everyone.

09:21.181 --> 09:23.047
I am Rudy!

09:23.116 --> 09:25.149
I wish we had Ga-Ga
when I was in school.

09:25.218 --> 09:27.151
I wouldn't have spent
every recess by myself

09:27.220 --> 09:29.554
- talking to roly-poly bugs.
- Gross.

09:29.589 --> 09:32.190
Okay, people, I have an
exciting announcement.

09:32.259 --> 09:34.726
I have secured funding to build

09:34.794 --> 09:37.495
three new Ga-Ga pits right
here on the playground!

09:37.564 --> 09:39.664
Students, today we break ground

09:39.733 --> 09:42.834
on the Wagstaff Gagaplex!

09:43.470 --> 09:45.203
What is happening?

09:45.272 --> 09:46.838
We're turning this playground

09:46.873 --> 09:48.907
into a Ga-Ga-palooza

09:48.975 --> 09:51.376
that will separate the Ga-Ga winners

09:51.444 --> 09:53.311
from the Ga-Ga wieners.

09:53.346 --> 09:54.879
I mean, everyone's a winner.

09:54.948 --> 09:56.425
Game of togetherness, blah, blah, blah.

09:56.449 --> 09:58.249
These beautiful pits will stretch

09:58.318 --> 10:02.086
from where I'm standing all
the way to the opposite fence.

10:02.155 --> 10:05.256
All the way to the...

10:05.325 --> 10:07.725
No!

10:09.329 --> 10:11.663
Monkey Booby Man!

10:11.731 --> 10:14.065
I stepped on a fern with
a little leash on it.

10:14.134 --> 10:17.007
- What's up with that?
- Fern-Ando. Give it!

10:17.429 --> 10:20.272
Look what they did to
you, Monkey Booby Man.

10:20.297 --> 10:22.007
I have another announcement.

10:22.032 --> 10:23.076
To celebrate the success
of my groundbreaking

10:23.101 --> 10:25.390
Ga-Ga ball program,

10:25.445 --> 10:27.475
we are having a ball-slapping,

10:27.500 --> 10:28.699
anything-can-happen,

10:28.768 --> 10:31.402
winner-take-all tournament.

10:31.470 --> 10:33.637
What is wrong with you people?!

10:33.706 --> 10:36.373
It's all happening
this Friday at recess.

10:36.442 --> 10:38.075
Sign-up sheets are here by the swing...

10:38.144 --> 10:40.411
- You're a bunch of Ga-Ga bots!
- By the swing set.

10:40.479 --> 10:42.379
How do you live with yourselves?!

10:42.448 --> 10:44.226
- Okay could someone take care of this?
- Monsters!

10:44.250 --> 10:47.212
Security? I guess that
means you, Ms. Labonz?

10:47.237 --> 10:49.586
Gene, hush! Don't make me get up.

10:49.655 --> 10:51.065
I'm very comfortable.

10:51.090 --> 10:55.426
Fine! -Now back to your
regularly scheduled Ga-Ga!

10:55.494 --> 10:57.728
Gene, we saw.

10:57.797 --> 10:59.441
I can't believe they
chopped down Monkey...

10:59.465 --> 11:01.698
- Hey, Tina, Louise, you playing?
- Got to go.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.834
Love you, Gene! Sorry for your loss!

11:06.916 --> 11:08.439
Bye, Monkey Booby Man.

11:08.474 --> 11:10.407
It was an honor to
pick your dingle-berries.

11:10.476 --> 11:12.876
What's up, Gene? Who put
a kink in your Slinky?

11:12.945 --> 11:14.278
I'm the only person in the school

11:14.346 --> 11:15.779
who doesn't care about Ga-Ga ball.

11:15.848 --> 11:17.714
Yeah, I-I suppose you are.

11:17.783 --> 11:19.661
'Cause I love it. I don't
mind losin' all the time.

11:19.685 --> 11:21.061
I think it's cool.

11:21.086 --> 11:22.463
Hope I don't miss my turn
'cause I'm sitting here

11:22.488 --> 11:23.988
with you behind this trash can.

11:24.013 --> 11:26.460
- Somebody? Little help?
- Could you get that, Gene?

11:26.485 --> 11:29.219
I told Jimmy Junior I was gonna
go fart in the yearbook room.

11:29.267 --> 11:33.602
Aah! This is for what you did
to Monkey Booby Man!

11:33.866 --> 11:36.800
- Wow.
- Whoa! You mauled that ball, girl!

11:36.869 --> 11:39.236
I'm just saying, you got power,

11:39.305 --> 11:41.605
but you got accuracy, too.
If I had what you have,

11:41.674 --> 11:44.475
I might not lie in bed
every night dreadin' recess.

11:44.543 --> 11:47.177
- And climate change, vampires...
- Zeke?

11:47.246 --> 11:49.046
Oh, no, he saw me.
Aah! Get down! Get down!

11:49.114 --> 11:51.114
I thought you were farting
in the yearbook room.

11:51.150 --> 11:52.850
- I was!
- Then you came back?

11:52.918 --> 11:55.786
Yeah! -Sweet! So are
you playing or not?

11:55.855 --> 11:58.121
Yeah! I farted, and I'm ready to go.

11:58.190 --> 12:02.025
Okay! Who's ready to meet
your new favorite story reader?

12:02.099 --> 12:05.901
- I'm so nervous.
- Ta-da! Say hello to Punky Bookster.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.698
When she's not rockin', she's readin'.

12:07.766 --> 12:10.051
And the only drug she's
addicted to is books.

12:10.076 --> 12:12.002
- Wow.
- Uh, is that my shirt?

12:12.071 --> 12:15.005
Maybe. Okay, give me your thoughts,
everybody. Throw 'em at me.

12:15.047 --> 12:17.715
- That's my shirt.
- Besides that, besides that.

12:17.776 --> 12:19.309
I love it. That's my one note.

12:19.345 --> 12:21.645
I like three of the
four levels it works on.

12:21.714 --> 12:24.681
Great. Story time's tomorrow.
Teddy, you're on tech.

12:24.706 --> 12:26.172
Music cues, lighting cues.

12:26.197 --> 12:28.431
- There are music and lighting cues?
- Yeah.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.786
Okay, how long's it take
you to learn to play guitar?

12:30.811 --> 12:33.279
Like 20 minutes? -That sounds
like more than enough time.

12:34.289 --> 12:36.326
- So this is Ga-Ga ball, huh?
- Yep.

12:36.395 --> 12:38.362
- It's pretty great.
- Yeah.

12:38.430 --> 12:39.630
Very active.

12:39.698 --> 12:41.231
Ooh! Watch the lamp.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.011
- You watch your shins.
- Get out of the pit, woman.

12:43.035 --> 12:44.201
All right. Bye.

12:44.236 --> 12:45.903
I think I'm really good at this.

12:45.938 --> 12:47.070
You're out, sucker.

12:47.139 --> 12:48.672
Oh. Still glad I played.

12:48.741 --> 12:50.974
- So glad.
- You're still doing this?

12:51.043 --> 12:53.544
I never thought I'd say
this, but isn't it bedtime?

12:53.612 --> 12:56.380
We don't go to bed anymore.
We do this now.

12:56.415 --> 12:57.814
All I know is Rudy's got to go down

12:57.883 --> 12:59.216
in that tournament tomorrow.

12:59.285 --> 13:00.484
I am sick of him saying

13:00.553 --> 13:02.317
"No shame in losing to the best."

13:02.342 --> 13:04.054
Yeah, I think people
will be pretty happy

13:04.123 --> 13:05.222
with my winning phrase...

13:05.257 --> 13:06.390
"You just got banged."

13:06.458 --> 13:07.758
Then I point to my bangs.

13:07.826 --> 13:09.159
Mm, Tina, don't say "banged."

13:09.228 --> 13:10.305
What's wrong with "banged?"

13:10.329 --> 13:11.985
I banged you, I banged Mom.

13:12.010 --> 13:13.063
I'm gonna bang everyone in school.

13:13.131 --> 13:14.875
- Tina, Tina, Tina. No-no. No.
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.300
What? -Wait, the winner always
says something to the crowd?

13:17.336 --> 13:19.503
- Yeah, pretty much.
- And people have to listen?

13:19.572 --> 13:20.982
People want to listen to the winners.

13:21.006 --> 13:23.173
These days Ga-Ga talks and ca-ca walks.

13:23.242 --> 13:24.508
And then I bang you.

13:24.577 --> 13:25.776
- Banged.
- Oh, my God.

13:25.844 --> 13:28.178
Welcome, everyone,

13:28.247 --> 13:32.015
to the first annual Wagstaff
Ga-Ga Ball Friendship Tournament

13:32.084 --> 13:34.251
of Annihilation!

13:34.320 --> 13:37.220
Ms. Labonz, I want to
sign up for the tournament.

13:37.256 --> 13:39.356
You sounded pretty
intense when you said that.

13:39.425 --> 13:40.624
I am.

13:40.693 --> 13:41.858
Your fly is down.

13:41.927 --> 13:43.360
Excuse me.

13:43.385 --> 13:46.129
Did you see anything?

13:50.786 --> 13:52.853
Gene, you entered the tournament?

13:52.921 --> 13:55.121
You've never even
played Ga-Ga ball before.

13:55.157 --> 13:57.257
Yeah, well, Whoopi Goldberg wasn't a nun

13:57.326 --> 13:59.259
until she had to go
into witness protection,

13:59.328 --> 14:01.528
and she turned that choir around.

14:01.563 --> 14:03.864
What a wonderful opening ceremony.

14:03.932 --> 14:05.498
Thank you, Mr. Branca.

14:05.567 --> 14:06.677
Great ribbon dancing.

14:06.702 --> 14:09.044
Now, contestants to your pits!

14:09.115 --> 14:11.316
I've had quite a few energy drinks,

14:11.384 --> 14:14.144
and we are about to light
the candle on this mama jama!

14:15.488 --> 14:17.266
Okay, we got the amp,
the guitar, the boombox,

14:17.290 --> 14:19.426
the strobe light, wallet
chain, switchblade...

14:19.451 --> 14:21.434
Thought that would be
cool... We forget anything?

14:21.459 --> 14:23.270
Um, the book, maybe?

14:23.674 --> 14:25.161
Eh, they'll have one at the library.

14:25.216 --> 14:26.840
- Sure.
- Get ready, little kids.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.431
Punky Bookster's gonna stage dive

14:28.456 --> 14:30.372
right into your hearts and your face.

14:30.397 --> 14:32.897
I am so sorry I'm gonna miss this.

14:32.927 --> 14:34.493
Okay, here's how this works:

14:34.562 --> 14:35.961
four preliminary rounds.

14:36.030 --> 14:38.630
Top two from each round
advance to the finals,

14:38.666 --> 14:40.666
and the losers get bounced!

14:40.734 --> 14:44.036
Now, let the Ga-Ga begin-gin!

14:45.539 --> 14:46.872
You can do this, Gene.

14:48.142 --> 14:49.370
Good start.

14:52.146 --> 14:53.512
♪ Ga-Ga ♪

14:53.581 --> 14:55.347
♪ Ooh, Ga-Ga ♪

14:56.116 --> 14:59.251

14:59.286 --> 15:02.020

15:02.089 --> 15:05.200

15:05.225 --> 15:07.759
Wagstaff, I give you your final eight!

15:07.828 --> 15:09.428
Some headscratchers in there.

15:09.496 --> 15:11.163
Faculty, sorry about your brackets.

15:11.231 --> 15:12.564
I know we're friends, Gene.

15:12.633 --> 15:15.801
But in the pit, it don't mean... crud.

15:15.826 --> 15:17.002
Ugh! I thought I was gonna cuss.

15:17.027 --> 15:18.459
I really thought I was.

15:18.572 --> 15:19.905
Huh.

15:19.974 --> 15:21.484
Looking around, I'm
thinking the pyrotechnics

15:21.508 --> 15:23.041
might not be such a good idea.

15:23.110 --> 15:25.077
Yeah, scratch the fireworks.

15:25.135 --> 15:28.203
Frank? What are you doing here?
I thought you were out of town.

15:28.248 --> 15:30.382
I canceled my trip. I
was going to Seattle,

15:30.451 --> 15:32.751
but apparently, they
discontinued the Frasier tour.

15:32.820 --> 15:34.686
Aw, poor Frasier.

15:34.755 --> 15:36.154
I'm sorry, who are you?

15:36.190 --> 15:38.523
Wha... Seriously?

15:38.548 --> 15:41.549
Oh. You're that random lady
who I said could fill in for me.

15:41.629 --> 15:43.428
Yeah! I'm the random lady.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.997
Well, good news... I've got this.

15:45.032 --> 15:46.398
- You can go.
- Oh.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.067
Uh, but I want to do it.
It's no trouble.

15:49.103 --> 15:52.170
- Uh, what are you, anyway?
- I'm Punky Bookster.

15:52.239 --> 15:54.072
The headbanging queen of story time.

15:54.141 --> 15:57.109
Hmm. At least you didn't put
too much work into it, right?

15:57.144 --> 15:59.911
Now if you'll excuse me,
the Wizard's got to whiz.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.481
You'll be not here, when I get back?

16:02.549 --> 16:03.982
Wow. What a jerk.

16:04.051 --> 16:05.417
- You know what I think?
- What?

16:05.486 --> 16:06.997
I think he knows your
character's better.

16:07.021 --> 16:08.587
So what do we do?

16:08.656 --> 16:10.222
Well, Punky Bookster wouldn't leave.

16:10.290 --> 16:11.957
Punky Bookster would stay and fight.

16:12.026 --> 16:13.225
Damn right, she would.

16:13.293 --> 16:15.093
I'm thinking a read-off.

16:15.162 --> 16:16.662
Yes. Oh, my God, yes.

16:16.730 --> 16:18.730
I'm using my punk rock
to take on the man.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.132
Like The Wiggles.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.267
And then, there were two.

16:22.292 --> 16:26.181
Rudy and Gene, mano
a mano, Ga-Ga a Ga-Ga.

16:26.206 --> 16:28.907
Go, Gene, you stout
little son of a bitch!

16:28.976 --> 16:30.475
Knock him into sixth period!

16:30.544 --> 16:31.943
Hope you had fun, Gene.

16:32.012 --> 16:34.479
But now it's time to hit the showers.

16:34.548 --> 16:36.448
This school doesn't have showers.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.283
What have I been using?

16:38.352 --> 16:41.286
What the... ? I thought the
Wizard made you two disappear.

16:41.355 --> 16:42.821
I'm here to read to some kids.

16:42.890 --> 16:44.456
You and me are having a read-off.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.258
We'll see who the kids like better.

16:46.326 --> 16:47.793
Okay. Bring it on.

16:47.861 --> 16:50.195
Standard rules. One book, two readers.

16:50.264 --> 16:52.564
Punky reads a page, then
the Wizard reads a page.

16:52.599 --> 16:53.932
Oh, Frank, you're here.

16:54.001 --> 16:56.334
So we have two volunteer readers today?

16:56.403 --> 16:57.669
Don't worry, Miss Librarian.

16:57.738 --> 16:58.837
We worked it all out.

16:58.906 --> 17:00.770
- Pick a book.
- Okay. This one?

17:00.795 --> 17:03.809
- "The Dinosaur Went To The Store."
- Know it by heart.

17:03.877 --> 17:05.477
Whatever. Let's go.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.880
Hi, kids, I'm Punky Bookster!

17:08.949 --> 17:10.715
No, no, no, no.

17:10.784 --> 17:12.483
No, no, no, that's not a scary sound.

17:12.553 --> 17:15.186
It's a fun sound.

17:15.255 --> 17:17.155
Hey Gene, you been to Bali?

17:17.223 --> 17:18.623
No, why do you ask?

17:18.692 --> 17:21.193
'Cause you look Ball-inknees.

17:21.261 --> 17:23.561
Hold on, I have to think about that.

17:23.630 --> 17:25.230
"And then the dinosaur said,

17:25.299 --> 17:27.299
We better go down to the store."

17:27.367 --> 17:28.532
Oof. He's good.

17:28.602 --> 17:30.836
Ga-Ga black sheep have you any wool?

17:30.904 --> 17:33.371
Yes, sir, yes, sir, I forget the rest.

17:34.232 --> 17:35.676
Did you say something?

17:35.701 --> 17:37.576
- No.
- Oh.

17:37.644 --> 17:40.512
"And the dinosaur said,
'I should buy some eggs.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.848
I don't want to go egg-stinct.'"

17:42.916 --> 17:45.417
The end. Thank you, library!

17:45.486 --> 17:47.519
Ah! Ha, ha.

17:47.588 --> 17:50.489
Huh. I got to hand it to
you, that was a good read.

17:50.557 --> 17:51.723
That's not an easy book.

17:51.759 --> 17:53.558
Thanks. You were pretty good, too.

17:53.627 --> 17:56.027
You know, maybe this
read-off was kind of silly.

17:56.096 --> 17:57.529
You may be right.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.564
Story time shouldn't
be about Punky Bookster

17:59.633 --> 18:01.373
or the Wizard of Books.

18:01.398 --> 18:02.901
It's-it's about the kids.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.436
Yeah, some of them.

18:04.505 --> 18:06.671
- Not that one.
- Oh, no. That one's a disaster.

18:06.740 --> 18:09.241
Okay, I guess the switchblade
alarmed some parents.

18:09.309 --> 18:11.488
I just wanted to let you know
the police are on their way.

18:11.512 --> 18:12.978
I didn't call them.

18:13.046 --> 18:14.446
I thought you did a really good job,

18:14.481 --> 18:15.781
even with the big words.

18:15.849 --> 18:17.382
Crap. Teddy, let's get out of here.

18:17.417 --> 18:19.057
Leave the amp, leave
the guitar, let's go.

18:19.119 --> 18:20.352
You sure? That's Mort's stuff.

18:20.420 --> 18:21.920
I'm sure. Let's go, let's go!

18:21.955 --> 18:23.455
Abraca-bye.

18:23.524 --> 18:25.924
Yes. What an epic battle.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.560
Okay. Guess it's time to get fancy.

18:28.595 --> 18:30.167
Oh... oh, crap!

18:37.671 --> 18:39.304
A stunning upset!

18:39.373 --> 18:41.206
Gene Belcher, the big winner.

18:41.275 --> 18:42.407
What do you have to say?

18:42.476 --> 18:44.643
I want to say...

18:44.678 --> 18:46.444
you people have taken this too far!

18:47.185 --> 18:48.818
Oh, this again.
Give me... give me the megaphone.

18:48.843 --> 18:50.376
- Give me...
- No, I earned this!

18:50.572 --> 18:52.138
Yes, Ga-Ga ball is fun.

18:52.162 --> 18:53.576
It's a good game.

18:53.615 --> 18:55.295
But I bet some people
here are only playing

18:55.350 --> 18:57.254
because they felt pressured to.

18:57.279 --> 18:58.611
Pressured by their friends.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.598
Pressured by you, Mr. Frond.

19:00.623 --> 19:01.789
Don't be ridiculous.

19:01.824 --> 19:03.257
Everybody wants to be here

19:03.326 --> 19:05.202
more than at any school
activity we've ever had.

19:05.281 --> 19:07.191
Why do you hate Ga-Ga ball, Gene?

19:07.260 --> 19:09.159
I don't. I just don't like it

19:09.228 --> 19:11.996
when anything-ball is
all anyone talks about.

19:12.064 --> 19:14.398
I think when people say
"everyone" loves something,

19:14.467 --> 19:17.468
they're being a little loose
with the word "everyone."

19:17.536 --> 19:19.470
Everyone loves food and air.

19:19.538 --> 19:20.671
And Matt Damon.

19:20.740 --> 19:22.373
But that's about it, probably.

19:22.441 --> 19:24.575
It's not a good feeling
when someone says "everyone,"

19:24.644 --> 19:26.410
but they don't mean you. I...

19:26.479 --> 19:28.579
I guess that's all I wanted to say.

19:28.648 --> 19:29.680
Matt Damon!

19:29.749 --> 19:31.081
More about Matt Damon!

19:31.117 --> 19:32.383
Well, congratulations, Gene.

19:32.451 --> 19:34.485
You got through to literally none of us.

19:34.553 --> 19:35.586
Eh, fine.

19:35.655 --> 19:37.154
Hold on there, Gene.

19:37.189 --> 19:38.856
You didn't not get
through to none of us.

19:38.925 --> 19:41.492
You got through
to not none of us.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.427
I'm glad you said what you said.

19:43.496 --> 19:45.729
I miss melting crayons on the slide.

19:45.798 --> 19:47.665
I miss playing cats with my friends.

19:47.733 --> 19:48.866
Meow?

19:48.901 --> 19:50.734
And what about you, Mr. Frond?

19:50.803 --> 19:52.069
What? What about me?

19:52.138 --> 19:54.071
What about that little
boy you told us about?

19:54.140 --> 19:56.674
The one whose used to talk
to roly polies at recess?

19:56.742 --> 19:59.376
Ha, well, this... the
roly polies were...

19:59.445 --> 20:01.445
they-they were just...

20:01.514 --> 20:04.081
Look, everybody, it's
the roly poly pope.

20:04.150 --> 20:05.449
His holy roly poliness.

20:05.484 --> 20:06.662
Come on. We're playing football.

20:06.686 --> 20:08.385
But I don't want to play.

20:08.454 --> 20:09.965
We're playing football.
Stop playing with your bugs!

20:11.490 --> 20:13.457
They're crustaceans, technically.

20:13.526 --> 20:16.460
Oh, my God. Now I'm the
super cool football guy

20:16.529 --> 20:17.928
on the playground.

20:17.997 --> 20:21.098
Maybe we could make do
with just one Ga-Ga pit.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.133
Everybody, do whatever
weird things you want.

20:23.202 --> 20:25.903
Mr. Branca, tear down those walls.

20:27.373 --> 20:29.039
Sorry we got carried away, Gene.

20:29.108 --> 20:30.240
Yeah, sorry, Gene.

20:30.309 --> 20:31.642
I'm sorry, too.

20:31.711 --> 20:33.644
Hey. You want to play Ga-Ga?

20:33.713 --> 20:35.713
- Seriously?
- Yeah. But first,

20:35.781 --> 20:38.148
when you look at that hedge
over there, what do you see?

20:38.184 --> 20:39.583
Um, a hedge.

20:39.652 --> 20:41.118
No, wait! A hippo... ?

20:41.187 --> 20:42.419
With a man bun?

20:42.488 --> 20:43.821
Ah. Yeah, I see it.

20:43.856 --> 20:45.422
I'm gonna say I see it?

20:45.491 --> 20:48.726
I got a date with you later,
Mr. Hippo Man Bun Shrub!

20:48.794 --> 20:50.227
Okay, let's do this.

20:50.262 --> 20:52.062
Ga-Ga ball!

20:56.135 --> 20:58.102
♪ ♪

21:03.943 --> 21:05.943
Monkey Booby Man!

21:08.848 --> 21:10.814
You just got banged.

21:22.036 --> 21:25.004
Let the Ga-Ga begin-gin!
