[in Spanish] I'm no Macaulay Culkin.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.361
[in English] If at first
you don't succeed...

01:52.028 --> 01:54.572
Maybe you should get used to failure.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.989
-Nice makeover.
-Can't say the same. [grunts]

02:37.073 --> 02:38.950
[in Spanish] You shave a gorilla,
it's still a gorilla.

02:39.033 --> 02:39.992
[grunts]

02:40.076 --> 02:43.705
[gasps] What if it's all a plot?
What if he's still coming?

02:43.788 --> 02:46.416
Head on the pillow. Head on the pillow.
We can do this, we can do this.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.835
-He could already be here!
-Fantastic, right?

02:48.918 --> 02:51.087
This place could use some
festive napkins and centerpieces.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.297
How can you make jokes?

02:52.380 --> 02:55.633
He's gone, all right?
We sent him away. Mission aborted.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.178
And maybe that point just isn't connecting
because you just deep fried your amygdala.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.557
Look, even if girlfriend,
I mean, comes strutting in here,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.268
he's what, about seven feet tall,
dressed like an extra from Cruising.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.019
I'm pretty sure I'll spot him
walking down the hallway.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.396
-[sighs]
-Come on.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.065
-Here, have a little drink.
-[exhales heavily]

03:12.900 --> 03:15.695
Now, you should probably expect some,
uh, primo headaches,

03:15.778 --> 03:18.281
a little bit of short-term memory loss,

03:18.365 --> 03:21.826
even a soupÃ§on of hellish hallucinations.

03:21.909 --> 03:23.411
Let's try and sleep
through some of that?

03:23.495 --> 03:25.955
Oh, I feel like my hot flashes
are having hot flashes.

03:26.038 --> 03:27.206
That, too.

03:28.165 --> 03:30.293
-[sighs]
-Okay. [sighs]

03:30.377 --> 03:33.588
I'm gonna make you a cold compress,
because I am all in

03:33.671 --> 03:37.217
on this whole role-reversal thing
we got going here, okay?

03:37.300 --> 03:41.429
Every parent becomes the child
sooner or later.

03:41.513 --> 03:44.391
[sniffles] But I didn't think
it would happen so soon.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.895
It was for you, Nicky, and for my girls.

03:48.978 --> 03:53.316
I wanted to slay the koshmar
so you can sleep at night.

03:53.400 --> 03:58.070
This piece of shit is not the reason
we can't sleep at night, I mean...

03:58.154 --> 04:00.156
Uh, the lights, the farting...

04:00.240 --> 04:01.658
-[inmate snoring]
-...the snoring, the creaking...

04:01.741 --> 04:04.452
I mean, the whole prison insomnia
jamboree, yeah,

04:04.536 --> 04:07.038
but this schmuck is
just another instrument in the band.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.164
[sighs]

04:09.081 --> 04:11.709
But we love that
you were thinking of us. [clears throat]

04:12.752 --> 04:14.003
I'm gonna grab the ice.
I'll be right back.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.505
No, no, don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.675
I'm not.
Uh, nobody's ever really alone, Red.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.928
We got a lifetime of regrets
to keep us company.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.520
-[in Russian] How was your day?
-[sighs] Fantastic.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.898
I discovered a whole new muscle
in my back I hadn't pulled yet.

04:33.981 --> 04:35.858
-[chuckles]
-You?

04:35.942 --> 04:38.486
Well, I soldered six more spindles
than yesterday.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.072
-Oh... Ah.
-So much job satisfaction.

04:41.155 --> 04:44.826
-Punching out early again, Galina?
-One minute early.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.539
There should be some perks
to dating you, no?

04:52.083 --> 04:55.753
My love and devotion aren't perky enough?

04:58.089 --> 05:00.508
[alarm blaring]

05:00.592 --> 05:01.926
Let me think on that.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.723
Mmm-hmm.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.517
[scoffs]

05:10.477 --> 05:13.313
He's always talking about the places
he'll take me.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.566
Odessa. Lake Chernobyl.
Then, nothing. All talk.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.067
So break up with him.

05:18.150 --> 05:20.027
What if he puts me on turbine duty?

05:20.111 --> 05:23.656
Yuliya Ovechkova did that for a month.
She has the hands of an old woman now.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.826
Fine. Waste your 20s on that goblin.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.746
Is he good in bed at least?

05:30.788 --> 05:33.583
I've never been with anyone else.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.293
When you think of him, what do you feel?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.587
[sighs]

05:38.546 --> 05:40.297
-Sleepy.
-[sputters and chuckles]

05:40.382 --> 05:43.009
-He's Relanium made flesh.
-[chuckles]

05:43.968 --> 05:46.596
-[sighs]
-Hey. Look what I bought.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.017
-Levi's.
-[gasps]

05:51.100 --> 05:54.854
-Nadezhda! Where did you get those?
-A boy from the university.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.857
He said they make the ass of the wearer
look like the Charlie's Angels.

05:57.940 --> 06:02.570
-Where can you even wear them?
-A party. Tonight. He invited me.

06:02.654 --> 06:07.074
-And he said I could bring friends.
-I don't like parties.

06:07.158 --> 06:10.412
Soggy herring and accordion music.
Nervous men asking you to dance.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.080
Oh, Galina, you have been going
to the wrong parties.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.041
-[young Red scoffs]
-[young Dmitri grunts]

06:15.124 --> 06:19.045
-You waited. [chuckles nervously]
-We're not waiting. We're just sitting.

06:19.879 --> 06:24.634
Galina... I want to take you
to the Georgian restaurant tonight.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.428
They have the greatest chakapuli.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.595
[sighs]

06:28.513 --> 06:29.764
We're going to a party.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.349
After, then.

06:32.434 --> 06:35.061
When does it end? 8:00? 8:30?

06:35.144 --> 06:37.772
-When the sun rises.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.357
-You'll miss curfew.
-[both chuckle]

06:40.442 --> 06:43.486
See? He's a hamster
in jackboots. [chuckles]

06:43.570 --> 06:47.824
-A gerbil, Galina. Hamsters at least bite.
-[both chuckle]

06:50.409 --> 06:51.494
How'd you get this number?

06:51.578 --> 06:54.330
The warden, Caputo.
He said you could help.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.124
Jesus Christ. Even when he's a hostage
he's making work for me.

06:57.208 --> 07:01.838
Please. My son is in intensive care
and I need to see him before...

07:03.005 --> 07:06.509
he wakes up.
Caputo said that you could help.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.719
Just like that.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.637
Look, I know you don't get
somethin' for nothin'

07:09.721 --> 07:11.514
but what do you think I got to offer, huh?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.558
You could free the hostages.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.393
Well, how do I know that you are gonna
deliver what I am askin' for?

07:16.478 --> 07:18.896
You don't,
but I seem to be your only shot.

07:20.189 --> 07:24.026
Look, release the hostages
and you'll see your son.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.615
Look, there's 400 bitches in here

07:28.698 --> 07:31.493
asking for a whole lot more
for those hostages.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.828
So don't ask their permission.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.371
Look, what...
What's more important to you?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.332
Your... your criminal peer group
or your child?

07:38.415 --> 07:39.751
[scoffs]

07:40.960 --> 07:45.297
Just to be clear... you are asking me
to fuck over everyone I know.

07:45.923 --> 07:48.217
First lesson of business school.

07:49.301 --> 07:51.513
-That was a joke. Hello?
-[phone clatters]

07:58.394 --> 07:59.979
[indistinct chatter]

08:04.066 --> 08:06.235
[Aleida] Holy shit.
[Margarita] Yeah.

08:06.318 --> 08:07.820
She ain't gonna be able
to hide from all this.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.906
You both gonna be famous.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.325
When I wanted to rebel against my mother,
I had a few babies, packed some heroin.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.078
-But this?
-Yeah, she really committed.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.790
[exhales sharply]

08:25.171 --> 08:26.548
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Ma'am...

08:26.631 --> 08:28.132
you cannot be here.
You gotta turn this car around.

08:28.215 --> 08:29.842
Yeah, yeah.
No, I gotta talk to my daughter.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.553
Uh, okay, family goes behind
this barricade over here.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.596
I'm not family. I'm her mother!

08:33.679 --> 08:35.722
Daya, it's me!

08:35.807 --> 08:37.558
Don't tell them anything!
You got rights!

08:37.642 --> 08:40.061
-Does she?
-I think you got rights!

08:40.144 --> 08:43.523
-Hey! I see you seeing me!
-[Hopper] Ma'am.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.483
Listen to your mother, you asshole!

08:46.568 --> 08:48.485
-Okay, okay, okay, don't touch me.
-All right.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.279
Don't touch me.
Sexual harassment!

08:50.362 --> 08:52.364
You need to start the car
and back it up, please.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.992
All right, all right, all right.
Okay. Okay.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.703
What's gonna happen to Diaz?

08:56.786 --> 08:58.913
We'll give her
a special sentence reduction

08:58.996 --> 09:00.540
to thank her for being so honest.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.457
Really?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.167
[Fig] Let's see
what shape the guard's in.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.589
That bitch going to Max till forever.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.676
Where were we?

09:11.759 --> 09:15.304
Think you was about to give us everything
we askin' for. [chuckles]

09:15.387 --> 09:16.764
Cute.

09:16.848 --> 09:22.103
Now, it is my understanding that
an education program is already in place.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.731
Y'all seen any education program
'round here?

09:24.814 --> 09:27.817
Mmm-mmm.
I guess it must've went missing.

09:27.900 --> 09:33.197
"The Life Skills Initiative provides
inmates with practical skills

09:33.280 --> 09:37.034
even more marketable
than the former GED program."

09:37.118 --> 09:38.327
-Life skills?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.955
She mean pourin' cement
with that dude with the abs.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.624
Man, we did that for, like,
less than a week.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.542
[Black Cindy] Mmm. Six wonderful days.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.921
And that beefcake put the semen in sement.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.465
Cement. It's pronounced cement.

09:52.466 --> 09:56.804
Now, tell me,
why exactly was that program stalled?

09:58.305 --> 10:00.474
[clicks tongue] Yeah...

10:00.557 --> 10:02.810
[stammers] I don't recall
at this juncture.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.228
You don't?

10:04.311 --> 10:07.106
They found a guard in the garden
all chopped up like Fancy Feast.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.901
You really don't remember?
It was, like, four days ago!

10:09.984 --> 10:11.568
Plus, that shit was dark.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.908
-Oops.
-[Fig] Wow.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.368
You girls have been busy.

10:19.451 --> 10:24.206
So, now, tell me, was this murder
also part of your nonviolent protest?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.917
The murder ain't the point.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.838
The point is our education program
ain't never been no education program,

10:30.922 --> 10:34.008
even before it was put on hold
for some alleged murder.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.887
Manual labor without instruction
ain't an education,

10:37.970 --> 10:40.181
and it damn sure ain't no life skills.

10:40.264 --> 10:44.560
You think she'd be sayin' "ain't" so much
if we had an education program?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.563
[Fig] I'd like to believe you.
Really, I would.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.942
But, in light of these
ongoing revelations,

10:51.025 --> 10:56.864
the injured guard you refuse to hand over,
it's tough. You lost credibility.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.576
[sighs and pounds table]

11:00.660 --> 11:02.161
Give me a second.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.913
Come on, Watson.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.165
You talk too fucking much!

11:06.248 --> 11:07.834
[Fig] Where is she going?

11:07.917 --> 11:10.670
[clicks tongue] She went to go
powder her argument.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.671
-[breathes deeply]
-So...

11:13.464 --> 11:16.133
-How's not being in prison?
-It's the best.

11:16.217 --> 11:20.262
We have these fancy gadgets to look at
when we wanna leave a conversation.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.018
All right. I'mma go pee.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.561
[in Spanish] Bam! Irkutsk is mine.

11:27.644 --> 11:30.022
-The fuck is Irkutsk, anyway?
-[inmate chuckles]

11:30.106 --> 11:31.816
[in English] All right, excuse me.
Coming through.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.360
Tryin' to live my best self, here.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.737
[sighs]

11:37.279 --> 11:38.614
[Piscatella whispering] Nichols.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.327
Nichols.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.457
[door creaking]

11:48.540 --> 11:49.917
[Nicky] Is that you, hot girl?

11:51.335 --> 11:52.586
[scoffs]

11:53.587 --> 11:56.048
Look, hey, man, [stammers]
I'm really sorry I don't remember your,

11:56.132 --> 11:58.009
you know, exact name
after we did the sex and all.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.927
I just want you to know that, uh...

12:00.011 --> 12:02.721
that does not mean I don't hold you
in a very high... [gasps]

12:02.805 --> 12:04.098
[grunts]

12:08.269 --> 12:09.311
Let me guess. [sighs]

12:09.395 --> 12:12.564
You need to sacrifice a few more
for the good of the many.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.151
I just wanted to tell you that it worked.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.778
That Dayanara saved us.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.907
That's funny. I don't feel saved.

12:20.990 --> 12:25.619
-Well, we're still negotiating.
-So the end justified the means.

12:26.578 --> 12:31.417
Look, I know how I am with a cause.
I know that I'm like a dog with a bone.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.045
Or an angry dragon
on its lonely mountain of gold.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.337
That, too.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.300
I know she freaks you out...

12:40.509 --> 12:41.677
Worthy Cause Piper.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.056
And she freaks me out, too.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.646
-But you're not sorry.
-No, I'm not sorry.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.442
Because I believe in my side.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.570
And you believe in yours.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.322
[chuckles] Fuck.

13:02.614 --> 13:05.701
Are we one of those romance novel,
red state, blue state couples?

13:05.784 --> 13:09.205
-Like James Carville and Mary Martin.
-Matalin.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.582
Or Maria and Arnold!

13:11.665 --> 13:14.376
They always did seem like
hopeless masochists to me.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.794
Maybe you're my Arnold.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.797
[imitates Arnold Schwarzenegger]
It's not a tumor!

13:18.881 --> 13:20.174
[chuckling]

13:21.300 --> 13:23.469
-Do not ever do that again.
-[laughs]

13:23.552 --> 13:25.596
No. Wow.

13:26.555 --> 13:29.892
-And don't ever fuck the housekeeper.
-Sure.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.023
[mumbling]

13:36.107 --> 13:37.191
[footsteps approaching]

13:37.274 --> 13:38.484
[woman chuckles]

13:38.567 --> 13:39.735
Hello?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.989
-Who's there?
-[woman chuckling]

13:43.906 --> 13:45.992
-Are those friendly feet?
-[chuckling continues]

13:49.453 --> 13:51.914
Jackpot! [gasps]

13:52.915 --> 13:57.836
-What's good on an open wound? Lotion.
-Definitely.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.464
-Shampoo?
-If it's got aloe.

14:00.547 --> 14:02.758
Um, those aren't yours.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.220
I told you the ghetto rats got
all the best bath products.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.305
They gotta lotion up all the time
or they get assy.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.935
-How would you know?
-I might've dated a black guy once.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.436
Angie!

14:15.479 --> 14:18.607
They're gonna, like,
revoke your Boston asshole card.

14:18.690 --> 14:21.485
I believe the term you're looking for
is "Masshole."

14:21.568 --> 14:25.447
[chuckles] Hey, we all gotta experiment!
You got Rumspringa...

14:25.531 --> 14:28.659
-I got Clarence.
-[both chuckle]

14:28.742 --> 14:29.994
[Angie clears throat]

14:31.578 --> 14:34.623
-Is it true what they say?
-What?

14:34.706 --> 14:36.292
"Once you go black, you don't go back"?

14:36.375 --> 14:39.921
More like, "Once you go Clarence,
you piss off your parents."

14:40.546 --> 14:43.257
Um, uh, uh, no.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.551
No, that's not your...
That is not your domain.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.386
You're not supposed to touch
other people's things.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.305
What's this for, anyway?

14:50.722 --> 14:54.060
-Got a secret baby around here?
-No. Point of order!

14:54.143 --> 14:58.355
Now, if you're gonna keep stealing
and being culturally, um, problematic,

14:58.439 --> 15:00.441
uh, you think you can set me free?

15:00.524 --> 15:04.695
-She needs something.
-Yeah, but what?

15:06.488 --> 15:07.656
Freedom!

15:07.739 --> 15:10.867
No, that's not it.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.372
Don't be scared.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.667
Life's gonna be so much easier now.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.169
[both chuckling]

15:20.252 --> 15:21.670
[inmate snoring]

15:23.380 --> 15:24.506
[sighs]

15:27.468 --> 15:29.220
[breathing heavily]

15:31.388 --> 15:32.974
[indistinct chatter]

15:35.809 --> 15:36.810
[gasps]

15:42.649 --> 15:45.777
You okay, Red?
You look a little twitchy.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.114
-Have you seen Nicky?
-No, have you seen DeMarco?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.241
-No.
-Good talk!

16:05.881 --> 16:10.011
-I thought Nichols was the doctor.
-[Lorna] Well, I gave myself a promotion.

16:10.094 --> 16:14.181
I figure after two full days of nursing,
I'm ready to start doctoring.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.891
Or... docting?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.019
-Both, probably.
-Mmm.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.104
So what do you got in here for depression?

16:20.187 --> 16:23.815
Well, we got, uh, Zoloft and the Lexapro,

16:23.899 --> 16:27.194
and a whole bunch of stuff
if you just wanna be unconscious.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.531
-This is more like a existential thing?
-Oh.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.866
You know, when you get
everything you ever wanted,

16:32.949 --> 16:35.702
and then you're, like,
"Is that all there is?"

16:35.786 --> 16:39.456
Hmm. Let me see what we got for that.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.375
Uh, let me ask you something.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.086
-Is it chronic?
-Sometimes.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.422
She's gone!

16:46.505 --> 16:47.673
-Who?
-Nicky!

16:47.756 --> 16:49.425
[breathes shakily]
You haven't seen her, have you?

16:49.508 --> 16:51.135
Well, no,
we're going through this fun phase

16:51.218 --> 16:54.180
where she can't stand to look at me.
I'm probably the wrong person to ask.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.931
Into thin air.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.641
-Like Nadezhda!
-Ooh!

16:57.724 --> 16:59.018
God bless you.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.312
Why don't you care?

17:01.395 --> 17:04.522
Oh, I see what's going on here.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.443
It's hard, isn't it?
Coming down off the strong stuff.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.902
I am not on drugs!

17:08.984 --> 17:11.280
Except for the ones already in my system.

17:11.363 --> 17:15.034
-Oh. Textbook denial.
-I saw somethin' like this on Dr. Drew.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.829
What if he came in after all?
Now that no one is suspecting?

17:18.912 --> 17:20.872
No, I got rid of him myself, Red.

17:20.955 --> 17:24.251
He bought it, hook, line and tinker.
You wanna see the text?

17:24.335 --> 17:26.420
You know, I ain't seen Flores
in a while either.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.255
How long before you count
somebody as missing?

17:28.339 --> 17:30.424
No, no, no, that is not helping.
Thank you.

17:30.507 --> 17:34.095
-Ex-nay on the issing-may.
-I know pig Latin, Lorna.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.680
Okay, Red, everyone knows
you're very smart.

17:36.763 --> 17:40.059
I shouldn't have to tell you
people don't just vanish into thin air.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.779
[Nadezhda speaks Russian and sighs]

17:52.863 --> 17:54.073
[knocking]

17:54.156 --> 17:57.118
-It doesn't look like anything.
-That's the whole point.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.744
It's a speakeasy.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.829
If they really want to be sub rosa,

18:00.912 --> 18:04.250
they should hire some hungry people
to stand outside.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.668
Grocery stores have lines
around the block.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.380
-[Nadezhda clears throat]
-[doorman] What do you want?

18:09.463 --> 18:11.590
Two cabbages and a soup bone.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.259
[door clattering]

18:21.808 --> 18:24.520
What happens if you ask for
a loaf of bread?

18:24.603 --> 18:25.854
[Nadezhda chuckles]

18:27.898 --> 18:29.316
[soft music playing]

18:43.872 --> 18:47.042
He was right.
They do give you the ass of an angel.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.544
Ah.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.255
And that skirt gives you Brezhnev's butt.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.632
Thanks.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.635
What do we do now?

18:57.553 --> 19:00.806
-We dance.
-It's too slow for the Barynya.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.269
You make it up, dummy.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.021
The Westerners use their hips,
like Elvis Presley.

19:08.104 --> 19:11.692
You're supposed to look like
you're having sex without touching.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.570
Like this?

19:15.612 --> 19:17.823
[chuckles] You look like
you hurt yourself.

19:22.244 --> 19:28.459
-That guy is staring at us.
-Not at us. At you.

19:30.877 --> 19:33.672
I don't know how he can breathe.
Those jeans are so tight!

19:33.755 --> 19:37.008
I like it. Truth in advertising.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.844
You know what you're buying.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.136
[snorts and chuckles] Nadezhda!

19:41.472 --> 19:44.933
His friend is the guy who sold me
the jeans. Don't look. Be cool.

19:47.018 --> 19:49.771
-Kostya.
-[speaks Russian]

19:49.855 --> 19:52.733
-You brought a friend.
-I said I would, didn't I?

19:52.816 --> 19:54.485
He wants to talk to her.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.238
Why doesn't he come over himself?

19:57.821 --> 20:01.242
He does what he wants.
We all do what he wants.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.702
He makes the parties.

20:03.785 --> 20:07.956
Go. Maybe he'll make a party
in your panties.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.877
[vocalizing]

20:20.719 --> 20:22.304
I haven't seen you before.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.516
I do my grocery shopping elsewhere.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.310
You're one of those factory girls, right?

20:28.394 --> 20:31.938
The ones who wash their clothes in vodka
to get the stink out?

20:34.065 --> 20:38.654
I never waste good vodka.
Vinegar does the job just as well.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.946
[chuckles]

20:40.989 --> 20:43.909
The work. You don't hate it?

20:43.992 --> 20:46.787
I don't have a choice, so I make the best.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.873
No. Stop that.

20:49.956 --> 20:52.167
Don't make the mistake
of committing yourself to the old ways.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.379
You need to be ready
for when the world changes.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.963
It happens fast.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.841
It's happening now!

20:59.925 --> 21:02.218
And you're going to show me
these new ways?

21:04.638 --> 21:06.432
I'm going to show you everything.

21:10.769 --> 21:15.316
âª Dropped it
Yes, on the way I dropped it âª

21:15.399 --> 21:19.110
âª And some fine brother picked it up âª

21:19.194 --> 21:21.029
[phone ringing]

21:26.327 --> 21:29.538
âª And put it in my pocket âª

21:29.621 --> 21:30.831
[phone continues ringing]

21:43.051 --> 21:44.303
Hello?

21:45.429 --> 21:48.765
[Angie in spooky voice]
Have you checked the children?

21:48.849 --> 21:51.768
Nope. Pause.
I know how this shit goes.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.729
The children is already dead,

21:53.812 --> 21:56.690
and I'm next because that's how it go
for black folk in the movies.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.027
Have you checked the children?

22:02.237 --> 22:03.655
Which children?

22:03.739 --> 22:05.532
[normal] She said, "Which children?"

22:05.616 --> 22:07.368
[Leanne] I don't know.
Make something up!

22:07.451 --> 22:08.577
[sighs]

22:10.454 --> 22:13.499
Spooky children.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.377
"Spooky children," bitch?
That don't even sit right with me.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.381
Look, instead of me checkin' the children,
how about you check your damn self?

22:20.464 --> 22:22.341
-Um... No!
-Angie, you suck at this!

22:22.424 --> 22:23.717
-[Angie] No, I wasn't done!
-Give it to me!

22:23.800 --> 22:25.135
Peace out.

22:27.345 --> 22:28.847
I see you!

22:31.224 --> 22:32.768
Hello? I said I...

22:36.522 --> 22:38.399
[line ringing]

22:38.482 --> 22:40.066
[Aleida] Come on, bitch, pick up!

22:41.109 --> 22:44.154
-You are religious?
-Church of Satan, ma'am.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.283
[line continues ringing]

22:51.412 --> 22:53.038
[cell phone ringing]

22:54.372 --> 22:58.334
Look. Uh, man, I should've told you
there was a riot.

22:58.419 --> 22:59.961
[in Spanish] I'm a fuckin' wuss, okay?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.838
[in English] I didn't want
to worry you, you know?

23:01.922 --> 23:03.339
You did what you had to do.

23:04.257 --> 23:06.552
I know Daya got herself in some bad shit.

23:07.636 --> 23:08.887
Just tell me she's okay.

23:11.097 --> 23:13.308
Yeah, yeah, she's okay.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.519
-You lying bitch!
-What?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.771
-Yo, this bitch lied to me twice!
-[gasping]

23:17.854 --> 23:19.898
[in Spanish] Aleida, calm down.

23:19.981 --> 23:24.778
[in English] I'm staring at my daughter
in handcuffs right now!

23:24.861 --> 23:27.238
I ask you to look out for her
and the next thing I know

23:27.322 --> 23:29.199
she's shooting somebody and confesses?

23:29.282 --> 23:31.076
-[sighs]
-Her life is over!

23:31.993 --> 23:34.412
You've been fucking up her life
for 23 years, querida.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.122
You think that I was gonna
undo that in a week?

23:36.206 --> 23:38.959
All you had to do was
be an equally bad mother,

23:39.042 --> 23:42.087
not a hundred
fuckin' thousand times worse.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.172
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice...

23:44.255 --> 23:45.882
[in Spanish] I'll fuckin' cut
your tit off.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.342
[in English] Yeah, you know what?

23:47.425 --> 23:49.260
I would love to stay here
and get yelled at,

23:49.344 --> 23:51.096
but I got my own kids to worry about.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.014
Yeah? Well, I'll be prayin'
for them little bastards,

23:53.098 --> 23:55.767
'cause they don't stand a chance
with you as their mother.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.438
-I hope you're wrong.
-Me, too!

24:00.522 --> 24:02.273
'Cause I'm tired of bein'
right about people.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.442
Have a good fucking life, okay?

24:08.905 --> 24:10.073
Fucking what?

24:11.825 --> 24:13.409
You are magnificent. [sighs]

24:18.999 --> 24:22.210
-[sighs] Hurry up!
-Man, this shit wouldn't cut butter!

24:22.293 --> 24:24.170
[Caputo] Jefferson, that you?

24:24.254 --> 24:27.298
Hold up, Mr. C. We settin' you free.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.635
Not free free, but you feel me.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.514
-Are you supposed to be doing that?
-Are you supposed to give a fuck?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.306
Cheerfully withdrawn.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.809
[Janae grunts and sighs]

24:37.893 --> 24:39.019
A'ight. [grunts]

24:40.020 --> 24:41.104
-[Taystee grunts]
-[Caputo sighs]

24:41.187 --> 24:43.231
-[Taystee] Damn!
-[Caputo sighs]

24:43.314 --> 24:45.526
No need to thank us, Mr. C.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.944
-I'm not thanking you. [sighs]
-[Taystee] You grudgin' it out.

24:48.028 --> 24:52.658
I respect that, but this ain't no freebie.
We need your help.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.701
You punched me.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.787
You took me hostage.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.329
Why would I ever, ever help you?

24:58.413 --> 25:00.541
-[groaning]
-[Taystee] Okay, let me catch you up.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.585
Previously,
on the Fucked-Up Prison Channel,

25:03.669 --> 25:06.337
we've been negotiating
for things like justice

25:06.421 --> 25:09.090
and better living conditions
and education,

25:09.174 --> 25:11.259
and the governor, he gave us Cheetos.

25:11.342 --> 25:15.055
But we said we don't want no blood Cheetos
so now they talkin' bullshit,

25:15.138 --> 25:17.473
sayin' that we already got
a education program,

25:17.558 --> 25:21.728
when everybody knows it's really
a dig-ditches-and-get-tetanus program.

25:23.521 --> 25:26.775
That program is slave labor,
plain and simple.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.027
See? Told you he still cared.

25:29.110 --> 25:34.115
Problem is, they sent us this negotiator,
but she don't believe us.

25:34.199 --> 25:39.245
That's when you come in.
You'll be our... credibility man.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.208
Who they send? [coughs]
They send a lawyer?

25:43.291 --> 25:47.713
[scoffs] Nah, they sent in that chick
that you hate... Figueroa.

25:47.796 --> 25:53.093
The one that used to have your job?
And look like a giraffe, but kinda sexy?

25:53.176 --> 25:56.972
-She ask about me?
-[scoffs] You did not come up.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.682
Ain't all about you, Mr. C.

25:58.765 --> 26:01.768
Oh, but we did get you a little gift.

26:01.852 --> 26:04.437
We, uh, got it from the guard bathroom.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.690
[Janae smacks lips] Piney fresh.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.819
Now that you piney fresh,
you can bring your ass.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.116
Where'd everybody go?
Shouldn't we go where it's more populated?

26:17.117 --> 26:20.954
Is this the teen-scream scenario? Hmm?

26:21.037 --> 26:24.332
Me in the letterman jacket,
you with the pom-poms.

26:24.415 --> 26:26.584
Okay, babe,
whatever gets your knickers wet.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.504
No, I'm really serious.
Don't you think it's spooky?

26:29.587 --> 26:31.840
-I heard people are going missing.
-Mmm.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.926
Maybe the SWAT team is plucking us out,
one at a time.

26:35.802 --> 26:38.304
-They can do that?
-[clicks tongue] Aw...

26:38.388 --> 26:41.266
Don't you worry about that, babe.
I won't let that happen to you.

26:41.349 --> 26:45.270
-This skeevy prison hookup is forever.
-[both chuckle]

26:45.353 --> 26:47.313
How do you think negotiations are going?

26:47.397 --> 26:50.859
Well, if I had to take a wild stab at it,
I'd say not very well.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.946
That Fig, she is a grade A,
locally-sourced megabitch.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.533
Yeah. Plus MCC's lawyers would file
a breach of contract

26:58.616 --> 27:01.119
before ever agreeing
to increasing the budget.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.831
So I've heard.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.708
Well, here we are.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.297
-In you go.
-[chuckles nervously]

27:12.714 --> 27:15.300
-[Linda] In... right here?
-Mmm-hmm.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.968
[Linda] It's so dark.

27:17.052 --> 27:19.971
The better to eat you with, my dear.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.472
-[chuckles]
-[Linda chuckles nervously]

27:22.515 --> 27:25.060
Gotta be a light switch
in here somewhere, right?

27:34.027 --> 27:35.445
-[clangs]
-Ow!

27:38.448 --> 27:40.033
Boo?

27:40.658 --> 27:41.993
Hello?

27:44.245 --> 27:45.538
This isn't funny.

27:55.631 --> 27:56.717
[softly] Fuck.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.270
[breathes shakily]

28:17.028 --> 28:18.613
[exhales heavily]

28:20.156 --> 28:22.033
[breathing raggedly]

28:31.501 --> 28:32.669
[grunts]

28:32.753 --> 28:34.212
[gasping]

28:36.422 --> 28:38.133
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

28:38.925 --> 28:42.053
Shower sex is for teenagers
and '80s movie vixens.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.555
-No one actually enjoys it.
-I enjoy it.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.141
Pipes, water is not a lubricant.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.352
[gasps] Finally,
someone who will believe me!

28:49.435 --> 28:51.687
See? Red gets it.
Shower sex is not a thing.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.232
-He's here. In the prison.
-Who?

28:54.315 --> 28:56.067
Piscatella.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.654
I woke the sleeping giant,
and now he's come down the beanstalk

28:59.738 --> 29:02.365
to stomp all over the village,
the village being prison.

29:02.448 --> 29:04.743
[inhales sharply] You think I sound crazy.

29:04.826 --> 29:06.077
Little bit.

29:06.161 --> 29:09.372
Yeah, a guard coming to a minimum security
prison to personally target someone?

29:09.455 --> 29:11.416
-Like, when has that happened before?
-Fair point.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.584
-Okay, so you saw him on the inside?
-No, but--

29:13.668 --> 29:15.211
-But he said he was coming in?
-[sighs]

29:15.295 --> 29:19.007
Actually, he said he wasn't.
But it's a trick, a smoke screen.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.716
And I'm not the only one he's targeting.

29:20.801 --> 29:24.846
He's making all the people
I care about disappear, one by one.

29:24.930 --> 29:29.559
He's aiming for the heart or for the mind.
A mind-heart combo.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.102
I think there's a pattern, see?

29:36.107 --> 29:37.400
Norma, missing.

29:37.483 --> 29:39.694
-Oh, boy.
-Frieda, missing.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.404
Gina, missing.

29:41.487 --> 29:44.074
Yoga, and now Blanca and Nicky--

29:44.157 --> 29:45.158
-Let me guess--
-Missing.

29:45.241 --> 29:48.453
I didn't know that Piscatella paid such
close attention to your social circles.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.038
This is serious, damn it!

29:50.121 --> 29:54.042
Red, I wanna believe you,
but you're making it impossible.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.795
Did you ever think that maybe
your prison pals are avoiding you

29:56.878 --> 29:58.754
because you're being, like,
an aggro psychopants?

29:58.839 --> 30:00.423
We've all been there.

30:00.506 --> 30:03.551
Nicky was getting me ice
and she just vanished!

30:04.219 --> 30:06.805
So Nicky didn't complete
a task set out before her?

30:06.888 --> 30:08.389
Like, shocker.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.141
She's probably with that new girl.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.893
Somehow she found a sexy loner

30:11.977 --> 30:13.769
we've never seen in prison
before to hook up with.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.898
We've all been there.

30:16.982 --> 30:20.235
Red, what's the, uh...
What's the frying pan for?

30:23.446 --> 30:25.281
For hitting him with.

30:25.365 --> 30:30.120
Okay. You need to get some rest, okay?

30:30.203 --> 30:31.830
And when we see Nicky,

30:31.913 --> 30:35.333
we're going to have her kick that girl
out of bed and come find you.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.878
-Okay?
-[Piper] Mmm-hmm.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.426
-What if it's really sudsy water?
-No, it's still not a lubricant.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.513
[breathing heavily]

30:50.181 --> 30:53.977
-[in Russian] How do I look in jeans?
-[sighs] Like the fall of empires.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.146
Like the beating heart of democracy.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.856
-That's it?
-[chuckles]

30:58.523 --> 30:59.732
[young Red chuckles]

31:00.691 --> 31:02.110
[Pavel breathes heavily]

31:03.111 --> 31:05.155
-Fuck. [chuckles]
-[giggles]

31:05.238 --> 31:09.325
First you can't wait to get me in jeans.
Now you want me out.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.163
Mmm!

31:13.246 --> 31:15.665
-I should add more bleach.
-[grunts]

31:15.748 --> 31:16.875
[giggles]

31:16.958 --> 31:20.253
Suddenly everyone wants them faded,
like Robert Plant.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.587
[knocking on door]

31:21.671 --> 31:25.716
[Pavel] What do you want?
[Nadezhda] Two cabbages and a soup bone.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.343
[sighs] We don't have any!

31:33.599 --> 31:34.684
[sighs]

31:34.767 --> 31:37.437
Go away, we're in love.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.563
Have you seen Kostya?

31:39.647 --> 31:42.067
-Not since Saturday.
-I'm worried.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.609
You don't think...
Could they have taken him?

31:44.903 --> 31:47.280
He sells blue jeans, not state secrets.

31:47.363 --> 31:49.657
They wouldn't say "blue jean selling."

31:49.740 --> 31:53.453
They'd say "Imprudent associations,"
or "Western decadence."

31:53.536 --> 31:56.539
Western decadence is important.

31:56.622 --> 31:59.459
People need to know
there's a world outside of Russia.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.962
The government can control
what's on the news,

32:02.045 --> 32:04.255
but not what people wear.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.591
Keep telling yourself that.
They can control whatever they want.

32:06.674 --> 32:09.594
Not the song in our heads.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.596
Supertramp. The Bay City Rollers.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.181
[chuckles] She's right.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.976
Of course she's right,
you're in love with her.

32:16.059 --> 32:20.688
Everything that was criminal
becomes normal, day by day.

32:20.771 --> 32:24.609
When the Beatles arrived, suddenly
the government didn't mind jazz so much.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.695
Now that there's the Ramones,
the Beatles are not so bad.

32:27.778 --> 32:33.076
And on like that,
till we are free like the West.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.744
We are pioneers.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.331
[sighs]

32:39.290 --> 32:40.375
Um...

32:40.458 --> 32:41.667
You have the next batch?

32:41.751 --> 32:44.170
I was thinking of trying to move them
by the botanical garden.

32:44.254 --> 32:47.548
Over there. Twelve acid wash,
12 James Dean dark blues.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.884
The Robert Plants are still cooking.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.762
Sell them near the tea shop
by the university.

32:52.845 --> 32:56.141
That's where Kostya was selling.
Maybe it's too conspicuous.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.683
Students pay more.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.729
[inhales deeply]
And they are the future for freedom.

33:01.812 --> 33:04.315
At least at the garden
I can hide in a bush.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.608
[chuckles]

33:07.110 --> 33:08.569
Here.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.489
Liquid courage.

33:11.572 --> 33:14.284
Go forth and sell liberty
and justice for all.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.747
-[speaks Russian and laughs]
-[young Red squeals]

33:22.125 --> 33:23.751
[humming]

33:33.636 --> 33:35.138
[Flaca whistles]

33:35.221 --> 33:39.725
[Maritza and Flaca] âª Come sing with us âª

33:39.809 --> 33:41.269
Oh, hell, no!

33:41.352 --> 33:44.022
âª Basic bitches âª

33:45.231 --> 33:48.776
-âª Bitches âª
-âª Bitches âª

33:48.859 --> 33:51.029
-[clicks tongue and sighs]
-[sighs] Crap, it died.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.323
[clicks tongue]
Video sucks up all the juice.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.783
-That's what she said.
-Did she, though?

33:55.866 --> 33:57.368
[sighs] We gotta find a charger.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.496
How else are we supposed to post
our dope original song

34:00.580 --> 34:02.207
in honor of getting 10,000 followers?

34:02.290 --> 34:05.376
And how we supposed to google something
if there's something to google?

34:05.460 --> 34:08.795
And where are we supposed to put our eyes
when we don't wanna see a nasty face?

34:08.879 --> 34:11.132
-What'd we do before, like, two days ago?
-[sighs]

34:11.216 --> 34:14.594
-I guess we used to talk to people.
-Crazy.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.637
Maybe we should just split up
and search separately.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.639
Hell, no, Scooby-Doo.
It's creepy as fuck in here!

34:19.724 --> 34:21.641
Plus, we do everything together.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.143
Yeah, you're right,
I don't know why I said that.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.230
[sighs] You were having, like,
a Snickers moment.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.938
You ain't you when you're hungry.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.652
Moving back in?

34:32.737 --> 34:35.281
[sighs] There's too many
mosquitoes outside.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.993
-I don't wanna get a Zika head.
-I don't think that's how it works.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.536
You know,
people build shelter for a reason.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.456
Outside is dark and dirty and...

34:44.540 --> 34:47.418
you know, some lolo jerk
stepped on my pillow.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.338
Another revolutionary bites the dust.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.132
Maybe I'll rediscover my ideals
in the morning.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.181
How do you know if you're going crazy?

35:01.682 --> 35:02.933
[sighs]

35:04.185 --> 35:08.106
Usually you don't,
because when you've really lost it,

35:08.189 --> 35:12.402
you're sure you're the only sane one
and everyone else has gone crazy.

35:12.485 --> 35:16.030
Like, my mom knew for sure
Kris Kristofferson was in love with her,

35:16.114 --> 35:20.368
and... and the police were crazy
for pulling her off his security wall.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.372
Do you have my cookbook?

35:25.290 --> 35:27.708
Sorry, um, I...

35:27.792 --> 35:30.878
I mean, I like to look at the pictures.
It feels like I'm eating.

35:31.879 --> 35:32.880
Is that sad?

35:35.216 --> 35:37.968
-That's what cookbooks are for.
-Hmm.

35:46.519 --> 35:47.937
[groans and sniffles]

35:52.442 --> 35:55.611
[in Russian] Son of a pig fucker.

35:56.654 --> 35:57.655
[sighs]

35:57.738 --> 36:00.032
Such a pretty language.

36:00.115 --> 36:01.701
[in Russian] What is this?

36:01.784 --> 36:06.331
It goes with a festive line dance.
Sort of like the Bielolitza.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.374
Disco is bullshit.

36:09.667 --> 36:13.796
-What do you mean, gone?
-I've been looking all night.

36:13.879 --> 36:16.466
Her mother hasn't heard from her
in three days.

36:16.549 --> 36:20.386
[sighs] Dmitri says she'll be fired
if she doesn't come to work tomorrow.

36:21.136 --> 36:22.388
Shit.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.810
-What if she tells them about us?
-She won't.

36:27.893 --> 36:29.979
-Are you sure?
-[sighs]

36:31.314 --> 36:34.024
I wonder if Kostya gave them her name,
and now Nadezhda--

36:34.108 --> 36:36.861
We have to do something for her.
Organize a demonstration.

36:36.944 --> 36:38.738
Before they make us all disappear,
one by one.

36:38.821 --> 36:42.950
No. What we have to do is
destroy the jeans, then lay low.

36:43.033 --> 36:44.034
Keep our heads down.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.162
[scoffs] What happened
to changing the world?

36:47.247 --> 36:48.831
It's gotten too dangerous.

36:48.914 --> 36:53.336
I thought you were brave.
But you don't want anything to change.

36:53.419 --> 36:56.339
You're the rebel that they can tolerate.

36:56.422 --> 37:01.219
You get to sit here and play your music
and feel like a punk,

37:01.302 --> 37:05.973
but if you're threatened,
you step right in line, don't you?

37:06.056 --> 37:09.184
-[sighs]
-That's why they leave you alone.

37:09.269 --> 37:12.021
You help each other exist.

37:12.104 --> 37:17.652
-You go too far, Galina.
-You don't go far enough.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.033
Joe? [panting]

37:24.116 --> 37:25.743
Which one are you?
Joe? [pants]

37:25.826 --> 37:27.537
[Stratman] Hello?
Uh, a little help?

37:27.620 --> 37:31.081
-[stutters] I'm looking for Joe.
-I can be Joe, if... if you want.

37:31.165 --> 37:32.292
Joe?

37:33.418 --> 37:34.419
Joe?

37:36.879 --> 37:38.213
Joe... [sighs]

37:39.173 --> 37:41.008
are you giving me the silent treatment?

37:42.718 --> 37:46.306
[Chang] Joe not here.
Went to see giraffe lady.

37:46.389 --> 37:49.642
-Giraffe lady?
-They fight but they also bone.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.519
Classic rom-com.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.979
[softly] What is going on?
What is happening?

37:54.939 --> 37:57.149
Where did everybody go? [panting]

37:58.276 --> 37:59.485
-Boo!
-[shrieks]

37:59.569 --> 38:01.529
What's the matter?
You lost your bitch, bitch?

38:01.612 --> 38:03.238
[sighs] I think, technically,
I'm her bitch.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.157
-Oh, yeah.
-[Helen chuckles]

38:05.783 --> 38:08.118
-Bitch, bitch. [laughs]
-Wait, wait, I got another one!

38:08.202 --> 38:10.496
Say, "Where'd everybody go?" again.
Say it!

38:10.580 --> 38:12.582
Please don't hurt me! [panting]

38:14.166 --> 38:16.168
No one wants to play with Brandy.

38:16.251 --> 38:18.087
-[indistinct chatter]
-[snoring]

38:24.344 --> 38:26.762
[in Spanish] You gotta watch 'em
even at night?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.848
You never know
what they could be plotting.

38:28.931 --> 38:31.767
[grunts] Yeah. Diabolical.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.273
[in English] Hey, you want a cigarette?

38:38.358 --> 38:41.110
I stole it from a guard locker
so... it ain't stale.

38:41.193 --> 38:42.653
Our mom used to smoke.

38:42.737 --> 38:45.280
And now she has a hole in her neck
the size of a Ritz cracker.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.079
Ah, sucks...

38:53.414 --> 38:55.249
how we gotta do the work in here.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.585
Me behind the stove,
you watching these sad fucks

38:57.668 --> 39:00.671
while everyone's outside
getting a suntan. [scoffs]

39:01.171 --> 39:03.716
We got job satisfaction, actually.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.885
Yeah, you maybe ought to think
about your choices.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.553
I mean, if you don't love
waking up in the morning,

39:07.637 --> 39:09.054
then you in the wrong line of work.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.852
Hmm. Tell me more
about this, uh, guarding shit.

39:14.935 --> 39:18.648
Hey, this about more than guarding.
This about our rights.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.940
Yeah, this is about performing

39:20.024 --> 39:22.860
unnecessary, revenge-motivated
strip searches.

39:22.943 --> 39:25.237
Yeah, and using a steady flow
of name-calling

39:25.320 --> 39:26.864
-to tear down their self-worth.
-Hmm.

39:26.947 --> 39:28.699
-[Luschek snoring]
-Hey, piss-bitch!

39:28.783 --> 39:32.161
-Oh, fuck! What? What'd I do?
-See?

39:32.244 --> 39:33.788
That does look rewarding.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.958
Thanks to them being locked up
and all at our mercy and everything,

39:38.042 --> 39:40.169
we have a chance to make
a real change around here.

39:40.252 --> 39:42.963
If your mom could talk
outta her Ritz cracker,

39:43.047 --> 39:44.549
I think she'd say she's proud of you.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.218
-Maybe.
-Yeah.

39:50.262 --> 39:51.722
[exhales heavily] All right!

39:52.765 --> 39:55.518
-You got room for one more?
-Who's gonna cook?

39:55.601 --> 39:58.103
-Ain't like there's food left. Right?
-[Ouija chuckles]

39:58.187 --> 40:01.065
It's nice to see you
finally gettin' in the spirit.

40:01.148 --> 40:03.484
[in Spanish] See? I told you
she wasn't just a bossy twatwaffle.

40:13.744 --> 40:16.581
-[door slams]
-Is that you, Vause?

40:25.047 --> 40:27.675
I thought that you hated shower sex.

40:38.728 --> 40:39.812
-[shower curtain opens]
-[gasps]

40:39.895 --> 40:43.483
I'm giving this one last shot. For you.

40:43.566 --> 40:44.900
So charitable.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.197
All right, suds me up.

40:51.365 --> 40:54.869
It's not something that you say
to a woman that you're trying to arouse.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.167
Convinced?

41:03.586 --> 41:05.505
I need to feel a few more arguments.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.341
[Piscatella breathing heavily]

41:17.141 --> 41:18.350
Hang on.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.062
I'm gonna go grab something
from my shower caddy.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.189
Props.

41:26.275 --> 41:29.529
Are you gonna tell me what they are
or you gonna surprise me?

41:38.621 --> 41:39.664
[gasps]

41:41.373 --> 41:42.457
[gasps]

41:45.252 --> 41:47.254
[indistinct chatter]

42:08.568 --> 42:09.735
[sighs]

42:13.739 --> 42:14.907
Now...

42:34.719 --> 42:35.970
Suzanne?

42:37.179 --> 42:38.388
Grace?

42:39.514 --> 42:41.225
Oh, my God!

42:43.936 --> 42:46.939
Oh, my...
This is wrong on so many levels.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.859
If you're gonna contour your blush,
you gotta blend better.

42:49.942 --> 42:51.902
I'm not comfortable.

42:51.986 --> 42:55.280
Oh, you poor thing.
Who did this to you?

42:57.241 --> 42:58.450
They said...

42:59.785 --> 43:00.995
I'm crazy.

43:02.412 --> 43:04.498
You wanna know what I think, Suzanne?

43:05.415 --> 43:09.169
I think crazy is just a word
people invented

43:09.253 --> 43:12.840
to keep the extra-interesting people down.

43:14.383 --> 43:20.347
Well, Mommy says there are many shades
of different as there are of people.

43:20.430 --> 43:23.100
Well, I wish I was told that
when I was growing up.

43:23.183 --> 43:24.351
[sniffles]

43:28.648 --> 43:29.774
Are those my meds?

43:30.691 --> 43:32.276
[breathes heavily]

43:35.988 --> 43:38.198
You don't need these anymore, Suzanne.

43:38.282 --> 43:41.535
No, actually... I do.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.706
They're just trying to
sand down your edges,

43:45.790 --> 43:47.667
make you all the same shade.

43:48.834 --> 43:52.672
I'm not good with metaphors,
but I do know one thing.

43:53.588 --> 43:58.427
You should be free to be you.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.638
Be me.

44:03.933 --> 44:06.852
Be... me.

44:09.479 --> 44:13.400
Oh, I am glad we had this talk.
I got a real good feeling about this.

44:13.483 --> 44:17.487
Free to be me and me.

44:18.363 --> 44:20.115
Figueroa.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.702
-She could be Latina.
-Or Italian.

44:22.785 --> 44:26.872
My husband is the world's whitest Mexican,
next to Louis C.K.

44:26.956 --> 44:30.918
-Hold up. Louis C.K. a Mexican?
-Mmm-hmm.

44:32.502 --> 44:34.004
Hey, check it out.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.090
-[Caputo sighs]
-We got new representation.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.300
I can see that.

44:39.343 --> 44:41.929
-Nice boxers.
-Thanks.

44:42.012 --> 44:45.432
They must've been a gift
from someone with very expensive taste.

44:45.515 --> 44:49.644
Expensive taste and a soul
made of old fingernail clippings.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.065
Mmm... 'kay.

44:53.148 --> 44:57.652
If memory serves, we were talking about
reinstating the GED program.

44:57.737 --> 45:01.782
The issue being the presence
of an existing education initiative.

45:01.866 --> 45:05.577
They called it education
so they don't have to pay the inmates.

45:05.660 --> 45:09.039
When I brought it to MCC,
it was an education program.

45:09.123 --> 45:10.791
They turned it into a chain gang.

45:10.875 --> 45:14.211
Aw, fascinating.
And how'd they sneak that one by you?

45:14.837 --> 45:16.546
Joe, thank God!

45:16.630 --> 45:18.257
You gotta get me out of here.
I can't do this anymore!

45:19.633 --> 45:23.971
What? Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
I am sorry! Your singing was terrible.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.142
One of our recent transfers from Psych.

45:28.225 --> 45:30.185
I'm not sure
she was ready for the transition.

45:30.269 --> 45:32.062
[indistinct chatter]

45:33.981 --> 45:35.816
Excuse me, I purchased that baton.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.360
We let her believe
that she's running the place.

45:38.443 --> 45:41.321
-[Taystee] Mmm...
-It's easier that way.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.282
Hey, whatever gets you through the day.

45:43.365 --> 45:44.909
-Hey! I was mad, I was mad, okay!
-[Janae] Let's go.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.493
You had lipstick on your ear...
Ow!

45:46.576 --> 45:47.912
[Caputo clears throat] Now...

45:47.995 --> 45:51.791
you're aware of the state's prerequisites
for education programs?

45:51.874 --> 45:52.875
You aware?

45:52.958 --> 45:56.837
Okay! Ow! Got it! I got it!
I got the memo.

45:58.255 --> 45:59.298
[pants] Ow.

45:59.381 --> 46:02.634
Hey! Don't I know you from somewhere?

46:02.717 --> 46:05.179
Uh, I guess I just have
one of those faces.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.932
Nah, you were on TV or... or somewhere.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.935
Oh. Yeah, duh.

46:11.018 --> 46:15.064
I'm, um...
I'm the Counterfeit Cunt of Connecticut.

46:15.147 --> 46:16.440
Somebody played me on Law &amp; Order.

46:17.107 --> 46:18.108
Who?

46:19.944 --> 46:21.195
Alyssa Milano.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.031
Carry on.

46:27.367 --> 46:29.411
No, wait. I remember now.

46:29.494 --> 46:32.747
You that hostage with the heels.

46:34.583 --> 46:35.667
These heels.

46:35.750 --> 46:37.586
[stammers and chuckles] I...

46:37.669 --> 46:40.505
How would I even get
something like that? I... [scoffs]

46:40.589 --> 46:43.550
I'm just your average, everyday,
hard-boiled perp

46:43.633 --> 46:46.761
being managed by the second-largest
for-profit prison corporation.

46:47.346 --> 46:50.765
[in Spanish] Hey, why don't
we make her pull a Cinderella?

46:50.850 --> 46:52.726
[in English] You mean, like,
make her ride a pumpkin?

46:52.809 --> 46:55.312
No, dumbass. If the shoe fits!

46:58.648 --> 47:01.693
You heard the lady. Saddle up.

47:02.611 --> 47:03.695
[Linda grunting]

47:03.778 --> 47:05.990
[inmate] Girl, you know they fit you.
Stop that.

47:06.073 --> 47:08.575
See? It won't fit.
My feet are too big.

47:08.658 --> 47:10.035
This how O.J. got off.

47:10.119 --> 47:11.745
I think she's spreading her toes.

47:11.828 --> 47:13.580
-Yo, I'll do it myself.
-[Linda] Uh, uh...

47:13.663 --> 47:16.250
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.
-Why not?

47:17.877 --> 47:20.087
-Because...
-[inmate] Oh, see?

47:21.922 --> 47:24.216
Hey, that bitch got my shiv!

47:24.299 --> 47:25.634
[inmates chattering and chuckling]

47:25.717 --> 47:27.887
See? Just like O.J.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.639
[indistinct chatter]

47:32.016 --> 47:33.183
[in Russian] Galina!

47:34.184 --> 47:35.685
Won't you even talk to me?

47:35.769 --> 47:39.106
Let me guess, you heard I broke up
with Pavel. Go ahead and gloat.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.941
You broke up with Pavel?

47:41.025 --> 47:44.653
[sighs] I thought I could change things.
With some jeans.

47:44.736 --> 47:47.322
-Isn't that stupid?
-No.

47:49.491 --> 47:51.743
Do you think, would they grant me
a transfer to Leningrad?

47:51.826 --> 47:54.079
-Maybe there it's different.
-It isn't.

47:55.205 --> 47:56.456
You have to go further.

47:56.540 --> 47:59.919
Where? Vladivostok?
Too many fish.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.629
We can't talk here.

48:04.798 --> 48:07.259
There's still five minutes
before the morning whistle.

48:08.593 --> 48:10.137
Hurry up, Miss!

48:10.220 --> 48:12.806
Screw off.
I'm talking to my sick mother!

48:15.100 --> 48:17.852
You always said
I never took you anywhere.

48:17.937 --> 48:19.646
So I started looking for a way that we--

48:19.729 --> 48:21.273
A trip?

48:21.356 --> 48:23.358
Don't you get it?
We're over.

48:23.442 --> 48:24.818
Listen to me.

48:29.156 --> 48:30.991
I know a way for us to leave Russia.

48:32.409 --> 48:34.036
It won't be easy,

48:34.995 --> 48:37.706
but they're letting the Jews emigrate.

48:38.748 --> 48:40.375
Not just to Israel now...

48:42.627 --> 48:43.670
but to America.

48:44.254 --> 48:45.589
You're not Jewish.

48:45.672 --> 48:48.467
There are agencies.
You pay them...

48:54.556 --> 48:56.850
to find your Jewish relatives.

48:56.933 --> 49:00.437
-And how does that help me?
-If we were married...

49:00.520 --> 49:01.896
So that's your plan.

49:02.856 --> 49:03.857
[spits]

49:04.691 --> 49:06.068
Listen.

49:10.614 --> 49:13.908
We don't have to be together in that way.

49:14.493 --> 49:16.620
It can all be for show.

49:17.579 --> 49:20.707
I know you think...
I'm not man enough for you.

49:20.790 --> 49:23.752
-[sighs] Dmitri--
-When we get to America...

49:25.004 --> 49:26.838
you can go your own way if you want.

49:27.756 --> 49:28.757
I can?

49:30.800 --> 49:32.136
But maybe...

49:34.179 --> 49:39.143
maybe I will show you I'm not a gerbil.

49:39.226 --> 49:42.354
-I am at least a hamster.
-[chuckles]

49:43.355 --> 49:46.150
All along, you were the one with teeth.

49:48.943 --> 49:50.070
[sighs]

49:52.364 --> 49:53.740
America.

49:54.824 --> 49:57.411
It's got to be better than this shit.

49:57.494 --> 49:59.079
[breathing heavily]

50:32.779 --> 50:34.198
[gasps]

50:40.454 --> 50:41.455
Jesus!

50:42.747 --> 50:44.624
-[pan clatters]
-[breathing heavily]

50:50.422 --> 50:52.882
[muffled grunting] Ow! Fuck.

50:52.966 --> 50:54.426
This is why I don't wax.

50:54.509 --> 50:57.179
-Where is he?
-Off playing Jason from Friday the 13th.

50:57.262 --> 50:59.181
Or Jason's mom, technically.
Spoiler alert.

50:59.264 --> 51:00.182
Are you hurt?

51:00.265 --> 51:01.558
Let's just say
it's a good thing I do yoga.

51:01.641 --> 51:02.851
Wait, I never do that shit.

51:02.934 --> 51:04.144
-Yoga. Where is she?
-I don't know.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.480
-And Gina and Norma? Shit!
-I don't know!

51:06.563 --> 51:10.900
Oh, what? I mean, this isn't enough,
uh, distressed damsels for you? [scoffs]

51:12.111 --> 51:13.112
[pants]
