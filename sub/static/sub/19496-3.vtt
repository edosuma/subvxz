01:14.170 --> 01:15.790
(thunder rumbling)

01:19.920 --> 01:22.380
Hi, Uncle Jax.

01:23.790 --> 01:25.420
Maia.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.250
How are you these days?

01:40.040 --> 01:43.670
Good. Very good.

01:48.830 --> 01:52.709
Glad things are going
so well for you, Mom.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.789
No, M-Maia, Maia.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.999
Maia. M...

01:57.000 --> 01:58.619
Maia, darling.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.209
That is not what it looked like.

02:00.210 --> 02:02.499
Tell me what
it looked like, Mom.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.459
Because my dad is in jail
for something he didn't do

02:05.460 --> 02:07.329
and you're fucking the man
who put him there?!

02:07.330 --> 02:08.669
Don't you use
that language with me!

02:08.669 --> 02:10.788
Oh!
I'm trying to talk

02:10.789 --> 02:12.619
some sense into him.
Oh, really?

02:12.620 --> 02:16.420
See, what kind of sense requires
him to take off his shirt?

02:17.460 --> 02:20.250
What kind do you think?

02:22.290 --> 02:24.919
Oh, my God. Seriously?

02:24.920 --> 02:28.080
You're telling me
you're doing this for Dad?

02:33.120 --> 02:36.169
Okay, good to know.

02:36.170 --> 02:39.459
Don't... don't
tell-tell Dad, please.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.920
It will kill him.

02:55.460 --> 02:58.170
Oh, my God.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.670
(speaks Arabic)

03:10.080 --> 03:11.499
Okay, it is done.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.919
We've removed one
piece of metal.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.329
Looks like shrapnel.

03:14.330 --> 03:16.379
MAN: Good, it's all good.
How big is it?

03:16.380 --> 03:18.380
(both speaking Arabic)

03:20.290 --> 03:21.709
Three centimeters by one.

03:21.710 --> 03:23.669
You're doing fine, Yusuf.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.999
Can you move the camera closer?
Roger.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.079
Can you ask the dentist

03:27.080 --> 03:28.459
to suture it up
and close the hole?

03:28.460 --> 03:29.789
A couple of bites should do it.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.459
Just tie and repeat.

03:31.460 --> 03:34.789
(Yusuf speaking Arabic)

03:34.790 --> 03:36.579
Good. The shrapnel's gone.

03:36.580 --> 03:38.079
You'll need to keep track

03:38.080 --> 03:40.459
of the blood pressure
and the fever spikes.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.669
Okay, for the second lesion,
sew towards yourself

03:43.670 --> 03:46.379
and keep tension on the stitch.

03:46.380 --> 03:48.459
(Yusuf speaking Arabic)

03:48.460 --> 03:49.789
(boom resonates)

03:49.790 --> 03:52.539
Is everything all right there,
Yusuf?

03:52.540 --> 03:54.829
It's Syria, Doctor.
Clearly no.

03:54.830 --> 03:58.749
We thought we heard a sound,
a rumble.

03:58.750 --> 03:59.999
All good here.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.209
Just watching a dentist
save a life.

04:01.210 --> 04:03.579
(knocking on door)

04:03.580 --> 04:05.619
Sounds like it's where you are,
Doctor.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.619
With your Chicago murder rate,
I'm worried.

04:07.620 --> 04:08.749
Keep monitoring him.
We don't want any big changes.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.619
I'll try to check in later,

04:10.620 --> 04:13.119
but I might be
out of circulation.
Dr. Randolph Picot?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.209
What is wrong, Doctor?
Yes.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.579
What is this about?
You're under arrest.

04:15.580 --> 04:16.789
Please place your hands
behind your back.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.959
I'm in the middle
of an operation.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.459
Please place your hands

04:19.459 --> 04:21.040
behind your back.

04:25.580 --> 04:28.619
BARBARA: Salaries charged
as expenses: $13.8 million.

04:28.620 --> 04:33.579
Actuarial gain on defined
benefit pensions: $3.1 million.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.459
Partners capital:
$3.4 million.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.539
And we're still waiting
for one capital contribution.

04:39.540 --> 04:43.959
But with that anticipation, the
profit for the financial year

04:43.960 --> 04:48.619
available for division
among partners: $8.5 million.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.579
Good. Then we're doing great.
Congrats.

04:51.580 --> 04:52.619
One problem.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.249
Of course.
Ventura Bridge,

04:54.250 --> 04:56.119
the cell phone tower company.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.579
They haven't paid
their retainer yet.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.789
It's got to be an oversight.

05:01.790 --> 05:03.959
Well, maybe,
but without their retainer,

05:03.960 --> 05:06.169
we're down $12,600,000.

05:06.170 --> 05:08.289
That means all the
equity partners will owe

05:08.290 --> 05:10.669
$300,000 more this year.

05:10.670 --> 05:13.669
(partners muttering)
ADRIAN:
It's an oversight, y'all.

05:13.670 --> 05:16.119
The Ventura Bridge is
a no-bid contract going back,

05:16.120 --> 05:17.539
what, five years?

05:17.540 --> 05:19.619
That's money in hand.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.499
Don't worry.
I will make a call.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.789
BARBARA: You better, or
we're all out $300,000.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.789
(phone rings)

05:26.790 --> 05:28.959
Diane Lockhart's office.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.540
No, she's in a meeting right
now, can I take a message?

05:32.880 --> 05:34.880
Okay.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.289
May I take a message?

05:38.290 --> 05:39.329
What?

05:39.330 --> 05:40.879
<i>May </i> I take a message?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.459
Thanks.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.619
<i>May </i> I help you?

05:43.620 --> 05:45.329
(chuckles)

05:45.330 --> 05:47.789
You did a bit of investigating
the other day, didn't you?

05:47.790 --> 05:49.459
I did a bit of investigating?

05:49.460 --> 05:51.169
I understand what
those words mean,

05:51.170 --> 05:53.289
but you'll have to give me
more context.

05:53.290 --> 05:54.290
I like your shoes.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.499
You went out and got the names

05:55.500 --> 05:56.879
for the class action.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.039
Oh, yeah.
I just... I worked at the mall,

06:00.040 --> 06:02.169
and it seemed easier to just
go talk to some friends.

06:02.170 --> 06:05.329
Hmm. I'm the investigator.

06:05.330 --> 06:08.499
Oh, I stepped on your toes,
didn't I?

06:08.500 --> 06:10.249
Well, it was
a one-time thing.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.959
Don't worry.
Marissa.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.379
(telephone ringing)

06:13.380 --> 06:15.580
I have to get that.

06:17.710 --> 06:23.250
Diane Lockhart's office.
How can I... <i>may </i> I help you?

06:29.380 --> 06:31.329
I know. I shouldn't
be interrupting you,

06:31.330 --> 06:32.749
but a Dr. Picot is on the line.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.669
Yes, it's his malpractice case.
Tell him I'll call him back.

06:34.670 --> 06:36.169
No, no, no, he was arrested.

06:36.170 --> 06:37.749
What? When?

06:37.750 --> 06:39.039
Just an hour ago.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.079
Why?

06:40.080 --> 06:42.000
Terrorism.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.419
I need to see my dad.

06:50.420 --> 06:53.709
See, I'm your lawyer,

06:53.710 --> 06:56.079
and I'm trying to save you
from an indictment.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.079
I still need to see him.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.619
I need to warn him.
I think he's being set up.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.669
By whom?

07:02.670 --> 07:04.170
My Uncle Jax and my mom.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.789
Okay.

07:13.790 --> 07:15.079
Here's the thing.
I'm going.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.959
Wait, you're going now?

07:16.960 --> 07:19.619
No, no, no. I'm going with
you to visit your dad.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.620
No, I don't need...

07:20.621 --> 07:21.829
That's nonnegotiable.

07:21.830 --> 07:24.249
Maia, there will be a moment

07:24.250 --> 07:25.789
when you tell a client,

07:25.790 --> 07:28.169
"For your own good,
you have to do what I say."

07:28.170 --> 07:30.789
This is one of those
moments for you.

07:30.790 --> 07:33.289
So, I'll allow you to
visit your dad in prison,

07:33.290 --> 07:34.789
but I'm gonna be there.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.749
I'm gonna hear everything
you say to him

07:36.750 --> 07:38.459
and everything he says to you,

07:38.460 --> 07:41.959
so it's subject
to attorney/client privilege.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.290
Do you understand?

07:44.290 --> 07:46.170
(lock buzzes)

07:55.250 --> 07:58.669
Oh, Dr. Picot?

07:58.670 --> 08:02.579
I'm Diane Lockhart,
your malpractice lawyer.

08:02.580 --> 08:05.249
This is quite a situation
you've gotten yourself into.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.789
Yes, I know,
a terrorist sympathizer.

08:07.790 --> 08:09.669
Won't my rabbi be surprised.

08:09.670 --> 08:13.499
And you were conducting
open-heart surgery in Syria?

08:13.500 --> 08:15.419
Medical personnel
have been so depleted

08:15.420 --> 08:18.669
in Syria that
Doctors Without Borders

08:18.670 --> 08:23.169
is providing technical support
via Skype to nondoctors there.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.579
I see, well, good.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.459
So, this is merely
an initial appearance

08:26.460 --> 08:30.079
to secure pretrial release,
so it should go fairly smoothly.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.579
So, you're clearly
not a flight risk.

08:31.580 --> 08:34.919
Well, I do have
a fishing cabin in Ontario,

08:34.919 --> 08:36.919
but it barely has a toilet.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.669
I like you, Doctor.
I think you're funny,

08:39.669 --> 08:41.669
but the court doesn't
do well with funny.

08:41.669 --> 08:42.999
Got it. Zip it.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.419
LUCCA: Uh, did you know
he was a terrorist?

08:44.420 --> 08:45.959
PICOT:
Excuse me?

08:45.960 --> 08:49.119
Your patient in Syria,
did you know he was a terrorist?

08:49.120 --> 08:53.169
Are you two together?

08:53.170 --> 08:55.419
Because I want her there,
that's all.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.119
It's still your case, Diane.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.829
It's an initial appearance.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.919
I don't need hand-holding
with an initial appearance.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.079
Who said anything
about hand-holding?

09:02.080 --> 09:04.459
Lucca wasn't doing anything,

09:04.460 --> 09:06.619
and she has experience
in federal court.

09:06.620 --> 09:10.289
Barbara, I was a name partner
at the town's biggest firm.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.249
Yes, and I'm a name partner
at this firm.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.459
(sighs)
I'm not questioning that.

09:14.460 --> 09:16.289
At your firm, Diane,

09:16.290 --> 09:18.619
did you sometimes overrule
the judgment of junior partners?

09:18.620 --> 09:21.459
So this is a lesson in humility?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.619
No.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.539
The prosecutor
is Colin Morrello.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.249
He is their top AUSA.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.959
It isn't wrong to have you two
working together, okay?

09:29.960 --> 09:30.960
Okay.

09:30.960 --> 09:31.960
Good luck.

09:31.961 --> 09:34.289
Right. Bye.

09:34.290 --> 09:36.959
Why are you really doing that?

09:36.960 --> 09:38.289
What do you mean?

09:38.290 --> 09:39.619
I want them to work together.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.959
Mm-mm, no, Barbara,
it's a power play.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.249
Now, I know that sound

09:45.250 --> 09:46.789
in your voice when you've got

09:46.790 --> 09:48.039
some kind of hidden agenda.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.619
She got Lucca's office.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.379
I don't want to lose Lucca.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.119
She needs to feel needed.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.959
See, here's the problem
with power.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.459
You got to take it from somebody
to give it to somebody else.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.619
Thank you, Sun Tzu.

09:59.620 --> 10:00.920
Barbara.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.459
Be nice to Diane.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.959
Don't rule it over her
like that, huh?

10:04.960 --> 10:06.789
Do I question your leadership?

10:06.790 --> 10:07.790
All the time.

10:07.791 --> 10:10.709
(laughs)

10:10.710 --> 10:11.879
Uh-huh.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.249
(laughs)
Okay.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.959
I'll behave.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.079
Good.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.619
Now what's going on with
our Ventura Bridge retainer?

10:20.620 --> 10:21.620
Is it coming?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.789
Yeah, we're having lunch

10:22.790 --> 10:24.459
with the CEO today.

10:24.460 --> 10:27.379
We'll get to the bottom of it.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.539
Hey.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.620
(whispering):
Be nice.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.959
Good morning, Your Honor.

10:36.960 --> 10:40.079
Good morning, Mr. Morrello.
Always a pleasure.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.459
Likewise.

10:41.460 --> 10:44.709
The government asks
the defendant be detained

10:44.710 --> 10:46.789
pending trial,
both as a flight risk

10:46.790 --> 10:48.459
and a danger to the community.

10:48.460 --> 10:49.749
Seriously, what kind of
danger to the community?!

10:49.750 --> 10:51.209
He's a renowned doctor
with no record.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.539
Oh, I seem to have struck
a chord over there, Your Honor.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.419
Yes, idiocy has a
way of doing that.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.919
Okay, thank you,
little cordiality here.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.539
Continue, Mr. Morrello.

11:00.540 --> 11:05.789
18 U.S. Code 2339A
prohibits anyone from providing

11:05.790 --> 11:08.829
material support
to terrorist organizations.

11:08.830 --> 11:11.959
When Dr. Picot operated
on a known terrorist...

11:11.960 --> 11:13.459
He didn't operate, Your Honor.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.619
He assisted in an operation
over Skype.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.459
Not just assisted.
He supervised.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.459
He is a trained
heart specialist,

11:19.460 --> 11:20.999
one of only three in America

11:21.000 --> 11:22.959
who could've performed
that operation.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.709
Your Honor, the AUSA left one
important word out of 18 U.S.C.

11:26.710 --> 11:29.379
"No one may <i>knowingly
</i> provide material support

11:29.380 --> 11:30.879
to a terrorist."

11:30.880 --> 11:33.209
Our client had no idea who
the patient was in Syria.

11:33.210 --> 11:35.789
All he knew was
that he was a human being

11:35.790 --> 11:37.289
in need of medical assistance.

11:37.290 --> 11:40.289
I have a-a quote here
from Dr. Picot

11:40.290 --> 11:42.329
to Medecins Sans Frontieres:

11:42.330 --> 11:45.459
"I have operated on gang members
in South Central

11:45.460 --> 11:47.539
"and serial killers.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.789
How can I draw a line
with terrorists?"

11:48.790 --> 11:50.789
LUCCA: I see.
So, the AUSA now wants

11:50.790 --> 11:53.119
to imprison our client for
his thoughts, not his actions.
I just thought

11:53.120 --> 11:55.289
Her Honor would enjoy
a little context here.
Our client's past statements

11:55.290 --> 11:56.829
have no bearing
on this case.
Okay. Okay.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.959
This is about a pretrial
release, that's all.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.789
It's not the Supreme Court.
It's not The Hague.

12:01.790 --> 12:04.999
Therefore, I rule: the defendant
is ordered released

12:05.000 --> 12:07.249
on an unsecured bond of $2,000.

12:07.250 --> 12:08.790
(gavel pounds)

12:10.000 --> 12:12.999
An executive dining room.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.379
My goodness,

12:14.380 --> 12:16.169
the cell tower business
must be good.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.829
(chuckles) You should know,
you're handling our contracts.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.079
BARBARA:
We <i>were </i> handling them.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.540
There seems to be
a holdup this year.

12:22.830 --> 12:24.959
Try this bread.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.499
They bake it every morning.
My office is upstairs.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.419
I smell it all day.

12:28.420 --> 12:31.249
All right, come on,
Ron, what's going on?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.380
We haven't gotten our retainer.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.420
(sighs)

12:39.830 --> 12:41.959
It's not just up to me.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.289
I have a board.

12:43.290 --> 12:44.749
They all have a voice.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.119
But we're
a no-bid contract, Ron.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.169
You get a tax credit
for 20% of our work.

12:49.170 --> 12:51.289
Are you unsatisfied
with our work?

12:51.290 --> 12:53.289
Then what?

12:53.290 --> 12:54.539
Things have changed.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.919
What does that mean?

12:55.920 --> 12:58.169
Do I really have
to spell it out?

12:58.170 --> 12:59.669
I think you do.

12:59.670 --> 13:03.119
A new administration.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.789
A new president.
ADRIAN: But they're
not pulling back

13:05.790 --> 13:08.119
on tax credits for hiring
minority-owned businesses.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.790
Yes, but you are not the only
minority-owned business.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.619
So who else are you talking to?

13:17.620 --> 13:19.329
RONALD: Look, come
back in at 4:00.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.959
Talk to the board.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.829
Explain your bid.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.790
I'm sure they'll listen.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.750
(coughs)
Okay.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.620
(elevator bell dings)

13:37.920 --> 13:39.119
Go ahead,

13:39.120 --> 13:40.500
I'll take the next one.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.579
It's what I said against Trump.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.249
I spoke at a rally.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.289
Mm, no, a lot of folks
spoke out against Trump.

13:55.290 --> 13:56.499
It's...

13:56.500 --> 13:57.790
Then what?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.330
What?

14:12.380 --> 14:13.380
(elevator bell dings)

14:26.460 --> 14:28.379
It's Andrew Hart.

14:28.380 --> 14:29.829
I thought he went
out of business.

14:29.830 --> 14:31.209
He runs a
12-man operation

14:31.210 --> 14:33.119
on the Gold Coast.
ADRIAN:
12 men?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.539
Is he fucking kidding?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.789
(chuckling): We have
80 lawyers here.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.079
It's minority-owned?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.079
Yes. They just moved
here from D.C.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.119
So it's about their
government connections?

14:41.120 --> 14:42.579
My guess?

14:42.580 --> 14:43.879
Something more.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.919
Like what?

14:45.920 --> 14:48.079
Andrew Hart is one of the few
African-American businessmen

14:48.080 --> 14:50.460
who ran a Trump PAC.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.749
Wow.

14:53.750 --> 14:56.710
So we're going bankrupt 'cause
we didn't pander to Trump.

14:59.710 --> 15:01.289
YUSUF: His pulse is
weaker, Doctor.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.619
His fever has spiked.

15:02.620 --> 15:03.879
We gave him
I.V. fluids,

15:03.880 --> 15:05.249
but his blood pressure
is falling anyway.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.619
PICOT:
Okay, it's okay, Yusuf.

15:06.620 --> 15:08.959
Tell him to give
the patient more I.V. fluid.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.879
He's gonna have to reopen
the incision.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.459
It will be swollen.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.459
O-Okay, hold on.
I need to translate.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.459
(sirens wailing)

15:16.460 --> 15:19.459
Wait, h-hold on, Yusuf, call me
back when you've done all that.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.249
Why?
I don't know how they
tapped the last Skype.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.959
I need to get to
a more secure place.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.290
I'll call you back.
Wait, what...

15:25.790 --> 15:27.459
Yusuf, are you there?

15:27.460 --> 15:28.709
YUSUF:
Yes, where are you?

15:28.710 --> 15:30.249
I'm outside.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.749
I might be moving.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.379
Where are we?

15:33.380 --> 15:36.119
The patient is intubated
and the chest is open, Doctor.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.619
Now what should he do?

15:37.620 --> 15:40.289
Uh... make sure
there's no new bleeding.

15:40.290 --> 15:42.619
Could be a laceration
in the heart that we missed.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.380
(Yusuf speaks Arabic)

15:46.880 --> 15:50.289
Okay, we're gonna take
this nice and slowly.

15:50.290 --> 15:51.579
Doctor?

15:51.580 --> 15:53.579
Yeah, one second.
Doctor.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.249
Okay, tell him to
leave the drain,

15:55.250 --> 15:58.039
wash around the heart with
antibiotics and close up.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.419
There isn't much time.

15:59.420 --> 16:00.749
Call somebody else.
He has six hours.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.379
You have the right
to remain silent.

16:02.380 --> 16:04.500
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

16:09.710 --> 16:12.460
(sighs)
How've you been, Dad?

16:15.960 --> 16:20.329
Sorry, it's just important that
Maia have her lawyer present.

16:20.330 --> 16:22.959
Yeah.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.169
I'm good, and you?

16:24.170 --> 16:25.460
How are you, Maia?

16:27.330 --> 16:28.880
Just act like I'm not here.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.830
I'm good.
I'm good, too.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.619
Can we, uh, get a little
space here, Rupert?

16:39.620 --> 16:41.119
Sorry.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.539
As your lawyer, Henry,
I can't advise it.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.209
So I heard you got a new job.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.999
MAIA: Uh, yeah, yeah,
it's good. I like it.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.709
HENRY:
Oh, I knew you would.

16:49.710 --> 16:51.830
And Mom told me that
you got a big case.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.619
Mom was here?

16:54.620 --> 16:55.829
This morning, yes.

16:55.830 --> 16:57.290
I told her you'd
be coming today.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.829
Did she say anything?

17:02.830 --> 17:04.169
About?

17:04.170 --> 17:05.419
I don't know.
(chuckles softly)

17:05.420 --> 17:06.999
Anything?
Well, uh,

17:07.000 --> 17:08.669
just that you and Amy are
getting harassing calls.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.118
Mm.

17:10.119 --> 17:12.459
That you're enjoying
this new law firm.

17:12.460 --> 17:16.118
And that you were worried
about Mom's cancer scare.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.669
Anything about Jax?

17:17.670 --> 17:20.249
I really don't think
we should go there.

17:20.250 --> 17:23.959
It's okay, Rupert.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.500
Just that he still blames
me for this Ponzi scheme.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.499
That's it?
Yeah.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.620
Why? What else?

17:43.620 --> 17:44.880
Do you re...

17:47.290 --> 17:49.879
Do you really think
that Mom is...

17:49.880 --> 17:52.669
helping you?

17:52.670 --> 17:53.670
Helping me with...?

17:55.330 --> 17:57.959
Well, is she standing by you
or, you know,

17:57.960 --> 18:01.290
is she standing by... Jax?

18:02.620 --> 18:04.790
Why would Mom stand by Jax?

18:06.330 --> 18:08.459
Well, I don't know.
(chuckles softly)

18:08.460 --> 18:12.169
But is that something...

18:12.170 --> 18:14.329
that worries you?

18:14.330 --> 18:16.000
Do you have any reason
to be worried?

18:30.790 --> 18:32.170
We should end this.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.290
Okay.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.619
(whispering):
Jax's personal computer.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.119
Watchdog...
RUPERT: Henry, no.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.579
YESHA: Let's... mm.
Let's go, come on.
No, Henry, no.

18:48.580 --> 18:50.290
Henry, no!
Come on,
come on, let's go.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.750
Thank you.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.289
Good-bye, Dad.

19:01.290 --> 19:03.960
Good-bye, sweetheart.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.850
(car alarm chirps)
Maia, what did he say?

19:10.830 --> 19:12.459
Maia, what?

19:12.460 --> 19:13.709
Nothing.

19:13.710 --> 19:16.249
He just said...
"I love you."

19:16.250 --> 19:17.619
Oh, come on.

19:17.620 --> 19:18.880
All right, let me see.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.540
Whatever he asked you to do,
Maia, you can't do it.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.119
There's no privilege here.

19:27.120 --> 19:28.419
A spouse can be prevented
from testifying,

19:28.420 --> 19:29.670
but you can't.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.579
JULIUS:
<i>I don't understand.</i>

19:35.580 --> 19:37.619
We're acting like this is over.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.379
They're just playing a
little hardball with us.

19:39.380 --> 19:41.169
So we lower our bid
by ten percent.

19:41.170 --> 19:43.379
The problem is they rely on the
government for low lease rates

19:43.380 --> 19:45.079
for their cell towers.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.879
They don't want to piss
off the Trump administration.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.669
Why would they piss off the
Trump administration with us?

19:49.670 --> 19:50.920
ADRIAN:
Because we're us...

19:52.170 --> 19:54.329
...you guys.

19:54.330 --> 19:57.119
Because of all
the police brutality cases.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.460
So what do we do?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.539
Hmm.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.540
(indistinct conversations)

20:10.540 --> 20:11.789
Who voted for Trump?

20:11.790 --> 20:13.119
(conversations stop)

20:13.120 --> 20:14.709
(man clears throat and coughs)

20:14.710 --> 20:16.169
LUCCA:
<i>We argue prior restraint.</i>

20:16.170 --> 20:18.209
They're saying he can't operate,

20:18.210 --> 20:20.669
even before they prove...
We don't have to go there.

20:20.670 --> 20:23.039
They haven't presented evidence
on the patient's identity yet.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.329
Okay, then we should argue both.

20:24.330 --> 20:27.249
Lucca, you're second chair.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.040
Yes, but I know how
to go after this guy.

20:32.170 --> 20:34.209
He is not the problem;
the problem is the law.

20:34.210 --> 20:36.580
It's both.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.579
Okay, you go first.

20:41.580 --> 20:42.829
Why?

20:42.830 --> 20:44.420
You distract him.

20:46.210 --> 20:49.079
(Lucca and Colin
argue over each other)

20:49.080 --> 20:51.379
Dr. Picot attempted a second
operation on the same terrorist.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.579
Arresting him again
is prior restraint.
Seriously?

20:53.580 --> 20:55.999
May I finish, Your Honor?
Do you two know each other?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.789
COLIN: Your Honor, the defendant
can no longer argue ignorance.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.169
He knows the patient
is a terrorist now.

21:00.170 --> 21:01.419
MORRIS:
How does he know that?

21:01.420 --> 21:03.119
Yeah, how?
Ms. Quinn.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.039
COLIN: He knows
because he was here

21:05.040 --> 21:07.459
three hours ago when we
argued he was a terrorist.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.749
But with what evidence?
We didn't hear any evidence.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.959
That evidence is confidential.
(chuckles)
And here we go.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.539
COLIN: Yes, unfortunately,
this country still has enemies.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.959
Sorry to inconvenience you,
Ms. Quinn.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.289
He's 19 years old.

21:17.290 --> 21:18.919
He's not a terrorist.
A Baghdad market

21:18.920 --> 21:20.419
was just blown up
by a 15-year-old.

21:20.420 --> 21:22.539
Terrorism doesn't
honor age, sir.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.879
Dr. Picot, how long does this
young man in Syria have to live?

21:24.880 --> 21:27.040
Four hours.

21:29.710 --> 21:31.459
MORRIS:
So I have until 5:00

21:31.460 --> 21:33.789
to decide this case.
All right, then.

21:33.790 --> 21:36.459
I will hear evidence on
Dr. Picot's pretrial release.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.460
You have already granted
his release.

21:37.461 --> 21:38.749
Your Honor,
this operation cannot happen.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.619
No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:40.620 --> 21:44.289
You have three and a half hours
to present evidence.

21:44.290 --> 21:47.789
Stop arguing
and get me the evidence.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.709
Marissa, it's an emergency.

21:49.710 --> 21:50.959
I need a witness from

21:50.960 --> 21:52.709
the Medical Licensing
Board right now.

21:52.710 --> 21:55.119
Yeah, where do you want
him or her, this witness?

21:55.120 --> 21:56.620
Okay, I'm on it, I'm on it.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.539
W-What do you need?

22:14.540 --> 22:15.789
The investigator.

22:15.790 --> 22:17.039
Oh, I don't know who that is.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.880
He's about this tall, black.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.290
That's not very helpful, is it?

22:22.830 --> 22:24.499
I'm Marissa, by the way.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.789
Maia.
I work over there.

22:25.790 --> 22:27.959
No, I know.
Nice to meet you.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.619
I work for Diane,
but when she's out,

22:29.620 --> 22:31.210
tell me if you need anything.

22:32.290 --> 22:34.790
What are you doing at 4:00?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.209
It's okay if you voted for him.

22:37.210 --> 22:38.709
We just need someone for a bid.

22:38.710 --> 22:40.119
(door opens)
MARISSA:
Sorry, sorry, hi.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.500
Do you have a minute?

22:43.710 --> 22:44.789
Why?

22:44.790 --> 22:46.169
You wanted me to tell you

22:46.170 --> 22:47.959
when I was needed to do
something investigative.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.790
I just was needed to do
something investigative.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.499
Wow, we have 80 lawyers
and 50 staff

22:54.500 --> 22:56.959
and not a single one
voted for Trump?

22:56.960 --> 23:00.169
Or not a single one
wanted to admit it.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.999
Maybe I'll just lie,
say I voted for him.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.459
Barbara, have you got a moment?

23:06.460 --> 23:08.710
What's on your mind?

23:10.710 --> 23:13.670
There won't be
any repercussions, right?

23:16.420 --> 23:18.329
Seriously?

23:18.330 --> 23:20.039
Oh, my God.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.879
Wait. You...

23:21.880 --> 23:22.830
voted for Trump?

23:22.831 --> 23:24.379
(sighs)

23:24.380 --> 23:26.829
Good.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.459
Then you will pitch for us.

23:28.460 --> 23:29.669
Oh, I hate this.

23:29.670 --> 23:31.709
I know, but it's for the firm.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.879
(sighs)
Look, I, uh...

23:34.880 --> 23:37.579
I don't get ostracized, right?

23:37.580 --> 23:39.079
I-I don't get
isolated?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.669
Look, Kanye voted for Trump.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.079
No, he didn't.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.919
He said he would've
if he did vote.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.039
Right.

23:46.040 --> 23:51.170
Well, no one's gonna know
but Adrian and myself.

23:53.290 --> 23:54.749
ADRIAN:
<i>Really?</i>

23:54.750 --> 23:56.119
Did he say why?

23:56.120 --> 23:58.249
Conservative politics.

23:58.250 --> 24:01.169
Ah. Well,

24:01.170 --> 24:02.829
Kanye voted for Trump.

24:02.830 --> 24:04.619
No, he didn't, but he would have

24:04.620 --> 24:06.790
if he had voted.
Well...

24:09.170 --> 24:10.459
...we have
our spokesperson.

24:10.460 --> 24:11.619
Listen,

24:11.620 --> 24:14.079
I promised him
he would not be ostracized here.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.789
Of course not.

24:15.790 --> 24:17.670
(sighs)

24:20.250 --> 24:21.959
(sighs)

24:21.960 --> 24:25.499
(loud, overlapping chatter)

24:25.500 --> 24:27.789
Mike, an eight ounce,
extra onions.

24:27.790 --> 24:28.999
I'm headed to court.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.170
How much time you got?

24:31.250 --> 24:32.959
Ten minutes.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.119
That's cutting it close.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.459
Here, have half.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.789
No, I'm fine.

24:38.790 --> 24:41.119
Judge said 3:00. You're
not gonna make it in time.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.790
MIKE: He's right.
I need 12 minutes.

24:43.790 --> 24:45.420
Go ahead.

24:46.460 --> 24:49.169
I like extra onions, peppers.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.580
Done.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.249
You're losing.
(laughs)

25:09.250 --> 25:10.499
This one's a slam dunk.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.749
Good.

25:11.750 --> 25:14.379
I like helping men
with their self-esteem issues.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.960
(chuckles)

25:18.170 --> 25:20.670
(whispers indistinctly)

25:24.120 --> 25:25.290
Good lawyer?

25:27.210 --> 25:28.750
Very talented.

25:30.290 --> 25:33.579
So how far does a smile get you?

25:33.580 --> 25:34.709
The...

25:34.710 --> 25:36.669
The bad boy Tom Cruise smiles.

25:36.670 --> 25:39.579
Do the judges go wild for it?

25:39.580 --> 25:41.209
That and a good argument.

25:41.210 --> 25:44.169
(chuckles) No.
I think you've always relied

25:44.170 --> 25:46.879
on the cute little
metrosexual thing.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.619
The, "Oh, my God,
the law is just something

25:49.620 --> 25:52.289
I stumbled into,"
shit-eating grin.

25:52.290 --> 25:55.669
Wow, the powers of perception.

25:55.670 --> 25:56.750
Thanks.

26:03.790 --> 26:06.209
Whoever wins buys
the other a drink.

26:06.210 --> 26:07.459
Won't you be busy...

26:07.460 --> 26:10.209
with your good
blonde lawyer there?

26:10.210 --> 26:11.919
Oh, I'll make time.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.540
Let me think about it.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.080
Thanks for the burger.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.379
This is melodrama,

26:22.380 --> 26:24.039
Your Honor.
Why is it
melodrama?

26:24.040 --> 26:26.539
If this man does not get
the help he needs, he will die.

26:26.540 --> 26:28.459
COLIN: Oh, my God.
LUCCA: That is an
assassination attempt!

26:28.460 --> 26:30.209
COLIN: We're preventing him
from making a terrorist well.

26:30.210 --> 26:31.419
That's all. This
is a terrorist
(door opens)

26:31.420 --> 26:33.379
who could be responsible
for the death

26:33.380 --> 26:35.959
of thousands.
Your Honor,
we have a witness.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.039
Thank God.
Let's swear someone in, please.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.249
Thank you so much.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.290
Actually,
it wasn't me, it was...

26:44.290 --> 26:45.959
Okay.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.119
Mala Kulkarni.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.539
I am president

26:48.540 --> 26:49.959
of the Medical Licensing
Board of Illinois.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.579
And can you tell the court
what this is?

26:51.580 --> 26:53.379
It is the section of

26:53.380 --> 26:55.119
the Illinois Compiled Statutes
that deals with

26:55.120 --> 26:57.419
disciplinary actions
against doctors.

26:57.420 --> 27:00.119
And under the list of grounds
for revoking a medical license,

27:00.120 --> 27:03.119
could you read number 16?

27:03.120 --> 27:04.499
"Abandonment of a patient."

27:04.500 --> 27:05.789
DIANE: And what
does that mean?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.879
MALA: Once a doctor has agreed
to care for a patient,

27:07.880 --> 27:09.539
he or she

27:09.540 --> 27:11.119
must follow through,

27:11.120 --> 27:13.379
unless he can find
an adequate substitute.

27:13.380 --> 27:14.789
And if he doesn't?

27:14.790 --> 27:15.959
He loses his license.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.169
DIANE: Your Honor, the
State is putting Dr. Picot

27:17.170 --> 27:18.459
in an untenable position.

27:18.460 --> 27:20.619
If he doesn't continue
this operation,

27:20.620 --> 27:21.829
he will lose his license.

27:21.830 --> 27:23.539
We have a rebuttal witness,
Your Honor.

27:23.540 --> 27:24.959
Colonel Spencer Mara.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.959
I command
Madigan Army Medical Center,

27:26.960 --> 27:28.329
out of Lewis-McChord,
Washington.

27:28.330 --> 27:30.209
Dr. Mara, are you familiar
with treating patients

27:30.210 --> 27:31.619
during combat conditions?

27:31.620 --> 27:32.709
I am.

27:32.710 --> 27:35.789
And once you start
treating a patient,

27:35.790 --> 27:38.329
do you always stay with them
until the end?

27:38.330 --> 27:39.539
SPENCER:
You try, obviously.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.959
But sometimes it's not safe.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.789
Sometimes you are needed
somewhere else urgently.

27:43.790 --> 27:45.459
You wouldn't expect
to lose your license over it,

27:45.460 --> 27:46.789
would you?
SPENCER: No.

27:46.790 --> 27:47.959
Not given battlefield
conditions.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.539
Your witness.

27:49.540 --> 27:51.119
Uh, you're aware, Dr. Mara,

27:51.120 --> 27:53.459
that the Geneva Convention
requires the proper care

27:53.460 --> 27:54.829
and treatment of enemy fighters?

27:54.830 --> 27:56.379
I am aware.

27:56.380 --> 27:57.879
By those rules,
wouldn't Dr. Picot be required

27:57.880 --> 28:00.119
to treat his patient?
The Geneva Convention

28:00.120 --> 28:03.459
only applies to cases involving
enemy conflict between states.

28:03.460 --> 28:04.619
That's not my question.

28:04.620 --> 28:05.669
Uh, objection, Your Honor.

28:05.670 --> 28:07.169
The witness should be allowed
to answer.

28:07.170 --> 28:08.170
Agreed. Go ahead.

28:08.171 --> 28:09.289
SPENCER:
This is not

28:09.290 --> 28:11.419
an armed conflict
between states.

28:11.420 --> 28:12.749
The patient is an ISIS fighter

28:12.750 --> 28:15.170
and therefore he is
an enemy combatant.

28:19.170 --> 28:20.919
I see.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.669
So this is different because
the patient is an ISIS fighter?

28:23.670 --> 28:24.709
SPENCER:
Exactly.
Um...

28:24.710 --> 28:26.169
don't you mean by that,
Dr. Mara...

28:26.170 --> 28:28.079
I think the doctor can speak
for himself, Counselor.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.170
How do you know
the patient is an ISIS fighter?

28:32.040 --> 28:33.789
Doctor?

28:33.790 --> 28:35.959
I... I may have misspoke.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.000
But you know the patient
is an ISIS fighter?

28:40.460 --> 28:42.669
Doctor, answer the question.

28:42.670 --> 28:43.999
I do.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.459
LUCCA: And how do you
know the patient

28:45.460 --> 28:46.420
is an ISIS fighter?

28:46.421 --> 28:47.579
SPENCER:
From the AUSA.

28:47.580 --> 28:48.580
DIANE:
Your Honor,

28:48.581 --> 28:50.119
the government's witness

28:50.120 --> 28:52.119
just opened the door
to the patient's identity.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.879
ISIS is a generic term,
Your Honor.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.169
No, it is not.
And the prosecution's witness

28:56.170 --> 28:59.329
has just argued that
he's a member of ISIS.

28:59.330 --> 29:00.539
We need to be shown
how he knows this.

29:00.540 --> 29:01.619
(Morris chuckles)

29:01.620 --> 29:03.669
She got you there,
Mr. AUSA.

29:03.670 --> 29:06.500
The kimono is opened. Who is he?

29:08.790 --> 29:11.749
Uh...

29:11.750 --> 29:13.919
we'll-we'll need a few hours
to gather this information.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.959
MORRIS:
No, no, no.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.329
Dr. Picot's patient
will be dead

29:16.330 --> 29:18.330
in two hours. Who is he?

29:19.420 --> 29:21.789
He is Tariq Aboulafia.

29:21.790 --> 29:25.329
MORRIS: Thank you.
A citizen of Syria?

29:25.330 --> 29:27.919
No.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.290
The United States.

29:42.790 --> 29:44.750
(doorbell rings)

29:54.250 --> 29:56.500
I was wondering if
you'd ever come by.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.420
Here I am.

30:03.420 --> 30:05.749
When was the last time
you were here?

30:05.750 --> 30:08.119
Uh, Christmas.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.459
Oh, that's right.
Chocolate-covered strawberries.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.499
Hmm.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.249
What can I get you, Maia?

30:13.250 --> 30:14.620
Answers.

30:15.670 --> 30:17.419
Well, I was thinking
more a beer,

30:17.420 --> 30:20.459
but I could probably manage
a few of those, too.

30:20.460 --> 30:23.459
What'd your dad say?

30:23.460 --> 30:26.119
You're responsible
for the Ponzi scheme.

30:26.120 --> 30:29.329
He caught you, that's why you
went to the feds and blamed him.

30:29.330 --> 30:30.789
And he and Lenore were just
unsuspecting victims...

30:30.790 --> 30:32.419
How's that not the truth?

30:32.420 --> 30:33.919
You know the truth, Maia.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.619
You watched your parents
all those years.

30:36.620 --> 30:40.619
Your dad wanted to be seen
as some genius of finance.

30:40.620 --> 30:43.119
Those articles in <i>Fortune?</i>

30:43.120 --> 30:44.750
I never wanted them, he did.

30:46.580 --> 30:50.579
The last thing he wanted
to admit was it was all luck.

30:50.580 --> 30:52.829
He was no genius at stocks.

30:52.830 --> 30:56.499
You throw a dart at a board,
it'd be more accurate.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.289
So when the bubble hit,

30:58.290 --> 31:02.169
he kept sending out statements
that he was still winning.

31:02.170 --> 31:05.079
That's the real truth
about your dad.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.879
He didn't want
to steal people's money.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.500
He just wanted
to be seen as a winner.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.499
Why are you sleeping
with my mom?

31:18.500 --> 31:21.289
I'm not sleeping with your mom.

31:21.290 --> 31:22.330
Fuck you.

31:24.170 --> 31:26.290
(phone ringing)

31:29.920 --> 31:32.880
Go ahead. I'm not
going anywhere.

31:41.540 --> 31:44.499
(ringing continues)

31:44.500 --> 31:46.669
JAX:
Yeah? Hey.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.539
No, I'm a little busy right now.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.540
No, no.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.620
Okay.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.289
No, I don't understand.
What is this regarding?

31:55.290 --> 31:57.709
It's regarding a very important
matter regarding your suit.

31:57.710 --> 32:00.119
Sorry for saying "regarding"
twice.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.579
Uh, my suit? I'm confused.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.249
Diane Lockhart has some
important information for you

32:03.250 --> 32:04.459
regarding the Rindell matter.

32:04.460 --> 32:05.709
She's not my lawyer.

32:05.710 --> 32:06.789
I know,

32:06.790 --> 32:08.209
but she has information for you.

32:08.210 --> 32:09.790
Okay.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.459
Can you put her on?
Actually,

32:12.460 --> 32:13.460
just one second.

32:13.461 --> 32:14.579
First, I need you
to write something down

32:14.580 --> 32:16.419
regarding Diane.

32:16.420 --> 32:17.420
Do you have a pen?

32:17.420 --> 32:18.420
Um...

32:18.421 --> 32:20.249
okay.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.789
This is very important.

32:21.790 --> 32:24.209
Please write it down exactly.

32:24.210 --> 32:28.959
The numbers 8, 7, 3, 1, 0, 9,

32:28.960 --> 32:31.539
lowercase "H,"

32:31.540 --> 32:34.460
capital letter "R,"
capital letter...

32:39.960 --> 32:41.080
(camera snaps)

32:42.460 --> 32:43.620
(camera snaps)

32:45.460 --> 32:47.249
Capital letter "U."

32:47.250 --> 32:50.459
Then the numbers 9 and 3.
Why don't you repeat it back?

32:50.460 --> 32:52.419
What is this about again?

32:52.420 --> 32:54.379
Diane wanted you to have
this code before you two talked.

32:54.380 --> 32:56.959
JAX: Why?
I, um, why?

32:56.960 --> 32:58.789
I wasn't told
all the whys and wherefores,

32:58.790 --> 33:00.209
but it seemed very important.

33:00.210 --> 33:02.209
One second.
What do you need?

33:02.210 --> 33:03.619
You.
Me? Why?

33:03.620 --> 33:05.459
We got the name of the patient
in Syria.

33:05.460 --> 33:08.119
His family lives in Chicago
and they won't talk to me.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.330
Why won't they talk to you?

33:10.960 --> 33:12.999
Okay, one second.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.329
Diane needs you
to hold a second,

33:14.330 --> 33:15.879
and she wants to talk to you.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.499
Tell her to call me back.
I have a guest here.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.959
No, wait, wait,
here she is. Diane,

33:20.960 --> 33:23.289
he's on right now.
No, seriously,

33:23.290 --> 33:24.999
he's on the phone.
He has a guest.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.289
He's getting impatient.

33:27.290 --> 33:28.829
Okay, I'll tell him.

33:28.830 --> 33:30.459
She's just hanging up
with the feds

33:30.460 --> 33:32.119
and they have important
information for you.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.289
JAX:
I'm hanging up now.

33:33.290 --> 33:35.459
No, I'm hanging up.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.669
Tell her to call me back. No.

33:37.670 --> 33:40.460
Then I'm sorry. Good-bye.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.959
(exhales)

33:44.960 --> 33:46.619
Sorry.

33:46.620 --> 33:47.879
Who was that?

33:47.880 --> 33:48.999
Diane's assistant.
Oh.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.619
Where were we?

33:50.620 --> 33:52.620
I have to go.

34:00.170 --> 34:01.749
You mention
that you voted for him.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.289
I am not just gonna say
"I voted for Trump."

34:04.290 --> 34:05.499
Why not?

34:05.500 --> 34:07.249
Because I am not
defined by that.

34:07.250 --> 34:10.708
Then say why our firm represents
a cross section of opinions.

34:10.710 --> 34:13.579
Uh, yeah. One Trump supporter,
98 Hillary supporters.

34:13.580 --> 34:16.579
You don't know that.

34:16.580 --> 34:17.998
Hey, Julius.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.500
Did you actually
give Trump money?

34:22.210 --> 34:24.619
(Zeinah speaking Arabic)

34:24.620 --> 34:26.958
Mm.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.918
(speaking Arabic)

34:28.920 --> 34:30.708
(woman speaking Arabic)

34:30.710 --> 34:32.248
Hello.
Hi.

34:32.250 --> 34:33.579
Beautiful stuff you have here.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.458
Thank you.
What are you looking for?

34:35.460 --> 34:38.210
You, I guess.
Do you have a minute?

34:40.500 --> 34:42.708
Are you with him?

34:42.710 --> 34:45.668
No.

34:45.670 --> 34:46.879
Yes.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.418
This is about your son.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.830
Tariq is in Syria,
and he needs your help.

34:56.880 --> 35:00.249
ZEINAH: This is my son, Tariq.
He is not a terrorist.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.919
Your Honor,
this is the patient's mother...

35:01.920 --> 35:03.119
May we finish?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.419
Yes, you may.
Mr. Morrello,

35:04.420 --> 35:06.579
you'll have your moment.

35:06.580 --> 35:08.289
Why was your son,
Tariq, in Syria?

35:08.290 --> 35:12.459
He... he wanted to convince
his brother to come home.

35:12.460 --> 35:15.169
His brother. And what is
the name of his brother?

35:15.170 --> 35:16.919
Aimar.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.959
And this would be
Aimar Aboulafia, a terrorist

35:18.960 --> 35:20.959
on America's Most Wanted list?

35:20.960 --> 35:23.169
So Tariq's brother,

35:23.170 --> 35:26.329
Aimar, would seem to be the
terrorist the U.S. is after,

35:26.330 --> 35:27.579
not Tariq?

35:27.580 --> 35:28.789
Tariq flew to Syria

35:28.790 --> 35:30.329
to try to stop him.

35:30.330 --> 35:31.999
He is not a terrorist.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.499
He is a student here.
He is studying chemistry.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.459
And he flew to Syria
with an airline ticket?

35:36.460 --> 35:38.579
ZEINAH: Yes! To
bring him home.

35:38.580 --> 35:40.419
DIANE: Your Honor,
Dr. Picot should be allowed

35:40.420 --> 35:42.959
to continue Tariq's surgery
because the person he is helping

35:42.960 --> 35:45.289
not only is not a terrorist,

35:45.290 --> 35:47.789
he is trying to persuade
a terrorist to come home.

35:47.790 --> 35:48.959
(people muttering)

35:48.960 --> 35:50.619
Mr. Morrello. Anything?

35:50.620 --> 35:54.000
Yes, Your Honor.
One second, please.

35:56.620 --> 36:01.119
U.S. Code 2339A prohibits anyone
from knowingly providing

36:01.120 --> 36:03.579
material support of any kind

36:03.580 --> 36:06.619
to a terrorist
or terrorist organization.

36:06.620 --> 36:09.329
Unfortunately,
by Ms. Aboulafia's admission,

36:09.330 --> 36:10.459
that is exactly what Tariq did.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.789
LUCCA:
What? Your Honor...

36:11.790 --> 36:14.169
Your Honor.
This is a new level
of desperation.

36:14.170 --> 36:15.329
What material support
are we talking about here?

36:15.330 --> 36:16.379
The airplane tickets.

36:16.380 --> 36:17.829
He wanted to bring
his brother home.

36:17.830 --> 36:20.459
Yes, which is supplying
material support.

36:20.460 --> 36:22.579
Oh, my God,
the sophistry here is amazing.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.749
Your Honor,

36:23.750 --> 36:27.669
Code 2339A is content neutral.

36:27.670 --> 36:30.289
In fact,
the Supreme Court decision

36:30.290 --> 36:33.959
in <i>Holder vs. Humanitarian Law
Project </i> made it very clear

36:33.960 --> 36:36.419
that the good intentions
of the Law Project

36:36.420 --> 36:39.079
made no difference
as to their culpability.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.499
All that mattered
is the material support itself.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.289
These airline tickets

36:44.290 --> 36:46.580
are clearly material support.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.879
Unfortunately, I agree.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.079
Your Honor.
This is not...
No, no.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.999
I may agree with you
on the spirit,

36:54.000 --> 36:55.919
but not the letter of the law.

36:55.920 --> 37:00.879
<i>Holder vs. HLP
</i> is a Supreme Court precedent,

37:00.880 --> 37:03.289
and that is how
this court rules,

37:03.290 --> 37:06.959
despite what my verdict means
for the poor man in Syria.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.419
The defendant is hereby detained
until trial.

37:10.420 --> 37:12.420
(gavel bangs)

37:19.120 --> 37:21.039
(phone ringing)

37:21.040 --> 37:23.959
Y-Yes, we need Dr. Picot.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.119
Unfortunately,
he's being held, Yusuf.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.209
The patient is not doing well.

37:28.210 --> 37:29.789
I know, we're still working
on options.

37:29.790 --> 37:32.789
(man shouting in Arabic)

37:32.790 --> 37:35.789
What's going on?

37:35.790 --> 37:38.249
There is someone here.

37:38.250 --> 37:41.379
He is threatening the staff.

37:41.380 --> 37:43.619
Threatening with what?

37:43.620 --> 37:45.959
Unless we operate,
he will kill someone.

37:45.960 --> 37:49.709
(shouting continues)

37:49.710 --> 37:51.709
Uh, Yusuf, can you turn
the iPhone toward him?

37:51.710 --> 37:52.959
The threatening man?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.750
Why?
Please. Can you turn the iPhone?

37:57.710 --> 37:59.710
MARISSA:
What are you doing?

38:09.000 --> 38:09.960
(video stops)

38:09.961 --> 38:11.459
That man right there.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.329
That's the patient's
brother, Aimar.

38:13.330 --> 38:15.539
He's threatening the medical
staff. If the patient dies,

38:15.540 --> 38:17.499
he will kill them.
DIANE:
Your Honor, this court

38:17.500 --> 38:19.329
must consider the
balance of hardships.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.669
The risk of Tariq Aboulafia
giving a plane ticket

38:21.670 --> 38:23.709
to a terrorist are
low and distant.

38:23.710 --> 38:25.499
The risk of an entire medical
staff being slaughtered

38:25.500 --> 38:28.619
by a terrorist
are high and immediate.

38:28.620 --> 38:31.119
The balance
of the hardships demand

38:31.120 --> 38:33.789
that this surgery proceed.

38:33.790 --> 38:35.289
(exhales)

38:35.290 --> 38:37.120
Mr. Morrello, anything?

38:47.960 --> 38:49.789
(whispers):
Good job.

38:49.790 --> 38:51.169
You, too.

Hey!

38:54.670 --> 38:55.879
No, no, no.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.119
Don't thank me.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.169
Thank Ju... Julius pitched.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.289
Julius pitched!

39:00.290 --> 39:02.460
(applause, cheering)

39:07.500 --> 39:09.120
Can I help you?

39:14.790 --> 39:16.749
You didn't vote for Trump.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.829
Excuse me?

39:18.830 --> 39:20.749
You didn't vote for Trump.

39:20.750 --> 39:24.619
You won the bid, but you can win
anything if you lie enough.

39:24.620 --> 39:28.709
Uh, not that it matters,
but I didn't lie.

39:28.710 --> 39:30.379
Hmm.

39:30.380 --> 39:34.579
Then you are in for
a very lonely life, my friend.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.459
(clearing throat):
Yeah.

39:36.460 --> 39:38.419
I'm a little busy, my friend.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.829
So, uh...
They'll thank you

39:39.830 --> 39:41.829
for winning the bid for them.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.999
They'll shake your hand.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.249
They'll slap you on the back.

39:46.250 --> 39:48.459
They'll applaud.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.789
And that will be it.

39:50.790 --> 39:55.919
You'll take the long walk
back to this office.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.040
And people will stop coming by.

40:00.620 --> 40:02.579
They'll stop needing your help.

40:02.580 --> 40:03.749
Okay, thank you. Good-bye.

NEWSCASTER: In a major victory
for U.S.-led coalition forces,

42:26.960 --> 42:29.619
the airstrike
killed Aimar Aboulafia,

42:29.620 --> 42:31.539
an American-born leader
of the Islamic State.

42:31.540 --> 42:32.999
According to the White Helmets,

42:33.000 --> 42:34.789
first responders
on the ground in Syria,

42:34.790 --> 42:36.039
the airstrike also killed...

42:36.040 --> 42:37.249
I didn't know.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.209
Didn't know what?

42:39.210 --> 42:40.789
Aboulafia was raised in Chicago,
and was linked

42:40.790 --> 42:43.579
to terrorist activity in Iraq,
as well as Syria.

42:43.580 --> 42:46.500
They wanted the delay in court.

42:51.120 --> 42:53.669
What are you talking about?

42:53.670 --> 42:57.579
They wanted to draw
the brother out.

42:57.580 --> 43:00.329
They wanted to get
him to that clinic.

43:00.330 --> 43:01.879
Also reportedly killed
in the drone strike

43:01.880 --> 43:04.460

and 34 hospital personnel.

(lock buzzes)

43:22.120 --> 43:23.380
(latch clicks)

43:28.040 --> 43:30.459
Oh... You did it.

43:30.460 --> 43:33.120
Yeah.

43:34.250 --> 43:35.879
What is it?

43:35.880 --> 43:38.620
Something to destroy Jax.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.880
And Mom?

43:46.380 --> 43:49.290
I don't know.
