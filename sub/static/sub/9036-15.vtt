WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:05.439
[door opens]

00:05.473 --> 00:08.042
- OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HOME.
SING THE A-B-C.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.343
- WHAT?

00:09.377 --> 00:11.245
- SING THE ALPHABET SONG,
A-B-C.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.247
- [singing]
A-B-C-D-E-F--

00:13.281 --> 00:15.449
- OKAY, NOW SING
"TWINKLE TWINKLE."

00:15.483 --> 00:16.650
- RAY--

00:16.684 --> 00:18.219
- WILL YOU JUST SING
"TWINKLE TWINKLE."

00:18.252 --> 00:21.089
- [singing]
TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR--

00:21.122 --> 00:22.490
- YEAH.
- OH, MY GOD!

00:22.523 --> 00:23.624
- AH-HAH!
- IT'S THE SAME SONG!

00:23.657 --> 00:27.661
- THANK YOU!
WE'RE GOING NUTS HERE.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.299
HI, I'M RAY

00:31.332 --> 00:32.400
AND I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

00:32.433 --> 00:34.168
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.536
SHE'S GREAT
WITH THE KIDS,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.638
THE HOUSE,
EVERYTHING.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.507
OH, I DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE DOES IT.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.242
WE'VE GOT
A DAUGHTER, ALLY,

00:41.275 --> 00:44.645
AND TWIN TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.714
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT THE KIDS.

00:46.747 --> 00:50.151
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.485
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:51.519 --> 00:54.522
AND MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.823
NOW, NOT EVERY FAMILY

00:55.856 --> 00:57.525
WOULD GO BY
ON A CONVEYER BELT FOR YOU,

00:57.558 --> 00:59.393
BUT MINE WOULD,
BECAUSE--

00:59.427 --> 01:02.196
- EVERYBODY
LOVES RAYMOND.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.098
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.573
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.242
[singing]
THIS OLD MAN, HE PLAYED ONE,

01:14.275 --> 01:16.377
HE PLAYED KNICK-KNACK
ON MY THUMB.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.812
- YEAH, SO?
- OKAY. NOW, JUST SLOW IT DOWN,

01:18.846 --> 01:22.550
AND THINK OF THE KIDS'
FAVORITE DOOFY DINOSAUR.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.887
- OHHHH!
- YEAH, YEAH!

01:26.920 --> 01:28.456
- [gasps]

01:28.489 --> 01:31.359
- I KNEW HE WAS
A BIG PURPLE HACK.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.127
- HEY, RAY.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.862
- OH, BOY.
WHAT?

01:34.895 --> 01:37.431
- WELL, YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE REACHED A DECISION.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.567
IT'S THE END
OF AN ERA.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.270
- OH, WELL,
AT LEAST IT WAS AMICABLE.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.904
- NO!

01:43.937 --> 01:46.140
WE'RE SELLING
THE OLD CAR.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.676
- YEAH.
IT'S JUST THE CAR.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.544
- WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU'RE SELLING THE VALIANT?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.180
- THAT'S RIGHT.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.781
WE'RE CLEANING IT OUT.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.816
THIS BATHING SUIT
WAS IN THE TRUNK.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.851
IT'S YOURS.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.787
- REMEMBER HOW CUTE
YOU LOOKED IN THAT, RAY?

01:59.820 --> 02:01.822
- YEAH. THANKS.

02:01.855 --> 02:04.592
I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR THIS.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.161
- STILL GOOD.

02:07.195 --> 02:08.796
- HELLO, OLD FRIEND.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.331
- WHAT'S THAT?

02:10.364 --> 02:11.565
- I THINK I CAN
TELL YOU THIS NOW, MA.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.602
THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS
FAKE I.D.

02:14.635 --> 02:18.372
- RAYMOND,
THIS ISN'T EVEN YOU.

02:18.406 --> 02:21.309
- SEE, MA, ALL WEEK LONG,
I WAS 17-YEAR-OLD RAY BARONE,

02:21.342 --> 02:22.810
BUT ON SATURDAY NIGHTS,

02:22.843 --> 02:27.181
I WAS 43-YEAR-OLD
ACHMED ABDULLAH KHAN.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.449
- OH.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.451
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.287
- I WAS A HOLY MAN.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.121
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.956
- OH, THEY WANT TO
SELL THE VALIANT.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.391
I LOVE THAT CAR.

02:37.425 --> 02:38.959
- YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE?

02:38.992 --> 02:42.296
THE $800 OFFER
I GOT FOR IT.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.297
- HEY, MAYBE
WE'LL TAKE IT.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.298
- OH, RAY, COME ON.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.799
- WHAT? WE'RE THINKING
OF GETTING A SECOND CAR.

02:45.833 --> 02:49.303
- YEAH, A NEW MINIVAN,
NOT A '72 VALIANT.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.339
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE INTERESTED?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.840
YOU CAN BUY THE CAR.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.610
- WELL, WE COULDN'T ASK THEM
TO PAY $800, FRANK.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.678
- THAT'S RIGHT.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.680
THERE'S ALREADY
ANOTHER OFFER.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.850
THE BIDDING
STARTS AT $800.

03:02.883 --> 03:03.851
- THAT'S NONSENSE.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.554
RAY, RAY, IF YOU WANT THE CAR,
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.955
- HEY, I'M NOT
GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.357
- WELL, DAD, I'LL GIVE YOU
SOMETHING FOR THE CAR.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.459
- NO, NO, WAIT.
WE DON'T WANT THE CAR.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.494
- LISTEN, WHILE WE'RE SAVING UP
FOR THE MINIVAN,

03:13.527 --> 03:14.995
YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING
TO RUN YOUR ERRANDS IN,

03:15.028 --> 03:17.631
AND WE WON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH
A SALESMAN TO GET IT.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.500
SO, HOW MUCH DO YOU
REALLY WANT FOR THE CAR?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.735
- $800.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.271
- FRANK, NO.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.673
LISTEN, YOU GIVE US
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.974
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.576
THIS IS A FINE
AUTOMOBILE.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.544
IT'S IN GOOD SHAPE.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.713
OKAY, I TELL YOU WHAT.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.515
YOU'RE MY SON--

03:34.548 --> 03:37.385
AND I LIKE YOU.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.820
GIVE ME $750.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.690
- HEY, I GUESS THAT SOUNDS--

03:42.723 --> 03:44.325
- INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.659
THAT CAR IS OVER
20 YEARS OLD.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.361
WE'LL GIVE YOU
$150 FOR IT.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.662
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
INSULT ME.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.663
- THAT IS INSULTING.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.998
- ALL RIGHT.
$200.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.500
- $200?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.501
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.368
WE'LL SPLIT
THE DIFFERENCE.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.337
MAKE IT $700.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.707
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
LET'S NOT HAGGLE.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.809
- I WANT TO
HELP YOU KIDS, UH--

04:01.842 --> 04:03.777
LET ME TALK TO MARIE.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.615
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.683
- ALL RIGHT.
$500, THAT'S IT.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.984
- OKAY, SO YOU DO
WANT THE CAR.

04:11.018 --> 04:11.985
- NO, I DON'T
WANT THE CAR,

04:12.019 --> 04:12.986
BUT IF WE HAVE TO TAKE IT,

04:13.020 --> 04:14.788
I WANT TO GET
A DEAL ON IT.

04:19.993 --> 04:21.862
- SHE WON'T LET ME
GO ANY LOWER.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.030
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:23.063 --> 04:26.700
SHE'S THE ONE THAT SAID
WE COULD PAY ANYTHING WE WANT.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.969
- I'VE CRUNCHED
THE NUMBERS.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.904
WE'RE ACTUALLY LOSING
ON THIS DEAL.

04:30.938 --> 04:31.972
- ALL RIGHT, $450.

04:32.005 --> 04:32.973
- $475.

04:33.006 --> 04:33.974
- $460.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.409
- I JUST PUT IN
WASHER FLUID.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.077
- $462.25.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.078
- DONE!

04:38.111 --> 04:39.647
- HEY.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.949
USE IT IN HEALTH,
SWEETIE.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.617
- OH, MAN, THIS IS GREAT.
GOOD.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.018
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK, DAD.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.087
- A CHECK?
- YEAH.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.656
- I'M AFRAID
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

04:48.689 --> 04:52.393
ASK FOR CASH FROM YOU,
ACHMED.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.801
- HELLO?
I'M HOME.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.603
HELLO?

05:04.137 --> 05:06.507
NOBODY HOME?

05:06.540 --> 05:11.078
AWWW! GREAT!

05:11.111 --> 05:16.784
OH, NOBODY HOME
TO BOTHER DADDY.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.921
[humming]

05:23.924 --> 05:25.726
- OH, RAY, HONEY,

05:25.759 --> 05:27.395
CAN YOU GIVE US
A HAND HERE?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.098
- THANK GOD YOU'RE--
YOU'RE HOME.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.900
I WAS WORRIED SICK HERE.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.771
- [sighs]

05:39.707 --> 05:43.477
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, RAY,

05:43.511 --> 05:45.946
FOR THAT WONDERFUL CAR.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.815
IT BROKE DOWN.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.717
- WHAT'D YOU DO TO IT?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.720
- I TRIED TO DRIVE IT, RAY.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.121
I'M COMING OUT OF
THE SUPERMARKET.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.556
IT'S POURING DOWN RAIN,

05:55.589 --> 05:57.024
SO I RUN US ALL
TO THE CAR,

05:57.057 --> 05:58.892
I GET THE KIDS
ALL STRAPPED IN,

05:58.926 --> 06:00.628
AND THE STUPID THING
WOULDN'T START.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.563
- OH, YOU--
YOU PROBABLY FLOODED IT.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.566
- OH, NOW IT'S MY FAULT.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.967
- WHEN YOU TURNED THE KEY
IN THE IGNITION,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.702
WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE?

06:08.736 --> 06:11.004
- THE RUSTLING
OF DIVORCE PAPERS.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.843
- THAT COULD HAVE BEEN
THE ALTERNATOR.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.812
- YOU KNOW, I HAD TO GO
GET US TOWED TO THE GARAGE.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.481
- SO THE KIDS GOT TO RIDE
IN THE TOW TRUCK.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.515
THEY MUST HAVE
LOVED THAT.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.751
- OH, YES.
THAT WAS MAGICAL, RAY,

06:23.784 --> 06:24.618
ESPECIALLY THE PART
WHERE MOMMY

06:24.652 --> 06:28.155
HAD TO PAY $300
FOR A NEW FUEL PUMP.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.690
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT CAR'S A PIECE OF JUNK.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.425
YOUR DAD
SOLD US A LEMON.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.093
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT, WE GOT A DEAL, OKAY?

06:33.126 --> 06:35.028
SO WHAT IF WE HAVE TO PUT
A LITTLE MONEY INTO IT?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.964
- WELL, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.499
I MEAN, BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO COMMUTE,

06:38.532 --> 06:39.833
YOU GET THE GOOD CAR.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.735
AND BECAUSE I'M JUST
THE HOUSEWIFE,

06:41.769 --> 06:44.472
I GET TO DRIVE
THE BUCKET OF BOLTS.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.707
LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO RETURN IT
AND GET OUR MONEY BACK.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.108
- NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.877
LOOK, MY FATHER
SOLD IT TO US

06:49.910 --> 06:51.144
FOR HALF OF
WHAT HE WANTED, OKAY?

06:51.178 --> 06:52.980
THAT'S PRACTICALLY A GIFT.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.848
- THE GIFT
THAT KEEPS ON TAKING.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.217
- COME ON,
I LOVE THAT CAR.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.852
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE
A LOOK AT IT, OKAY?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.120
I CAN FIX IT.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.456
- YES, RAY,
YOU'RE VERY MECHANICAL.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.859
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO RETURN
YOUR BUTTON-FLY JEANS.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.063
- LOOK, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
ALL RIGHT?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.532
WE CAN'T RETURN IT.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.100
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK
UNGRATEFUL.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.036
- RAY, WOULD YOU RATHER
I LOOK LIKE THIS?

07:17.638 --> 07:21.174
- YOU KNOW, ANGER IS JUST
MISDIRECTED PASSION.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.144
- SO THAT'S IT, RAY?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.613
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING TO THEM?

07:25.646 --> 07:27.014
- I AM. I AM.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.117
THE NEXT TIME THEY TRY
TO SELL US A 20-YEAR-OLD CAR,

07:30.150 --> 07:32.986
WE SAY,
"UH-UH, NOT SO FAST."

07:37.224 --> 07:39.026
- READY.
GO.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.101
- HI.
- HI.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.137
- GOOD.
A WITNESS.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.639
- WITNESS TO WHAT?

07:51.672 --> 07:56.610
- THE INEVITABLE TRIUMPH
OF TECHNOLOGY OVER MARIE.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.245
SEE, WE'RE PUTTING YOUR MONEY
TO GOOD USE.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.948
LOOK WHAT I BOUGHT,
A BREAD MACHINE.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.250
- I CAN STILL MAKE IT
FASTER AND BETTER MYSELF.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.652
- WE'LL SEE.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.620
HEY, I'M KNEADING ALREADY.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.822
LOOK WHO'S STILL MIXING.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.992
- IF I WIN, I'M GETTING RID
OF THIS STUPID BREAD MAKER.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.094
- SAME IF I WIN.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.069
- YOU KNOW, FRANK, I NEED TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE CAR.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.804
- I NEED SOME WATER.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.038
- I CANNOT HELP YOU.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.974
THE RULES ARE THE RULES.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.942
- OH.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.078
- YOU KNOW, THE CAR SEEMS
TO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.547
- THE CAR DOESN'T HAVE PROBLEMS,
SWEETHEART.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.915
IT HAS CHARACTER.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.116
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.552
WELL, YOU KNOW,
PART OF ITS CHARACTER

08:38.586 --> 08:40.921
IS THAT IT DOESN'T START, SO--

08:40.954 --> 08:42.623
- WHAT DID YOU DO,
FLOOD IT?

08:42.656 --> 08:44.958
- NO. I--

08:44.992 --> 08:47.861
- WELL, LOOK, YOU GOT TO
TREAT HER RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

08:47.895 --> 08:48.929
YOU HAVE TO FIDDLE WITH IT,

08:48.962 --> 08:51.264
LIKE, UH--
THE HEATER.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.934
YOU GOT TO SLIDE THE THING
ALL THE WAY TO COOL FIRST,

08:53.967 --> 08:56.136
AND THEN REALLY JAM IT
BACK TO HEAT.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.973
TRUST ME.
I'M VERY GOOD WITH MACHINES.

09:00.007 --> 09:03.243
STILL PUNCHING THE DOUGH,
EH, LOSER?

09:03.276 --> 09:06.146
- GUESS WHO
I'M THINKING ABOUT.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.918
- YOU KNOW, FRANK,
IT'S NOT JUST THE HEATER.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.119
THE MECHANIC SEEMS TO THINK

09:12.152 --> 09:13.954
IT'S GOING TO NEED
SOME MAJOR REPAIRS.

09:13.987 --> 09:14.988
- THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.590
YOU'RE TALKING TO MECHANICS.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.390
[bell dings]

09:17.424 --> 09:22.162
AH, I THINK
I'M BAKING ALREADY.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.599
AH, I LOVE THE SMELL OF
FRESH BREAD IN THE MORNING.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.601
IT SMELLS LIKE--

09:27.635 --> 09:29.169
VICTORY.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.642
- OKAY, LOOK,
COULD WE MAYBE--

09:34.675 --> 09:37.210
RETURN THE CAR
AND GET OUR MONEY BACK?

09:38.411 --> 09:39.947
MAYBE?

09:39.980 --> 09:43.050
- I ALREADY BOUGHT
THE BREAD MACHINE.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.953
- I-I THOUGHT RAY
WANTED THE CAR.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.788
DOES HE KNOW
YOU'RE OVER HERE?

09:47.821 --> 09:50.357
- UM--
NO.

09:50.390 --> 09:51.524
BUT THAT'S BETWEEN
RAY AND I,

09:51.558 --> 09:54.361
AND IN FACT, I'M THE ONE
WHO'S ACTUALLY DRIVING THE CAR,

09:54.394 --> 09:55.963
AND WHEN I SAY DRIVING,

09:55.996 --> 09:58.732
I'M USING THAT TERM LOOSELY.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.233
- WELL--

10:00.267 --> 10:02.135
I HAVE TO SAY, DEBRA,

10:02.169 --> 10:04.805
THIS DOESN'T SOUND
EXACTLY GRATEFUL.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.707
- GRATEFUL?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.976
WHAT DO I HAVE TO BE
GRATEFUL FOR?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.244
- I SMELL BREAD.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.152
IS THIS ABOUT ME?

10:22.289 --> 10:25.225
IT'S ABOUT THE WILL,
ISN'T IT?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.928
- DEBRA DOESN'T LIKE
THE VALIANT.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.029
- I CAN'T BLAME DEBRA.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.864
IF I WAS MARRIED TO SOMEONE
WHO WANTED TO HOLD ON

10:30.898 --> 10:34.201
TO THEIR OLD MAKE-OUT MOBILE,
I'D FEEL THE SAME WAY.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.871
- MAKE-OUT MOBILE?

10:37.905 --> 10:38.806
- THAT'S RIGHT.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.173
HE USED TO DRIVE AROUND
WITH THAT GIRL,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.876
UH, LISA SOMEBODY.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.112
- LISA CONSTANTINE.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.281
THAT'S WHEN HE FIRST STARTED
CALLING THE CAR "LUCKY."

10:51.284 --> 10:53.286
- I THOUGHT SHE WAS
SUCH A NICE GIRL.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.089
- OH, SHE WAS VERY NICE
TO RAYMOND.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.927
- SO, ROBERT,

10:59.960 --> 11:02.295
YOU'RE SAYING THAT RAY
WANTS TO HANG ONTO THIS CAR

11:02.329 --> 11:05.432
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
HE FIRST GOT L--

11:05.465 --> 11:06.734
LUCKY?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.135
- YEAH.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.436
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?
- NO.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.338
- OH.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.140
PERHAPS I'VE SAID TOO MUCH.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.829
- HEY, RAY.
WHAT'S UP?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.065
- OH, I'M JUST DOING
A LITTLE SIMONIZING.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.432
I GOT HER RUNNING GREAT NOW.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.835
A LITTLE GLUE.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.336
- HOW ARE THE KIDS?

11:43.370 --> 11:44.905
- KIDS?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.439
- OUR CHILDREN, RAY.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.440
- OH, YEAH.
NO.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.009
THEY'RE--
THEY'RE IN HERE--

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
SLEEPIN'.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.213
OH, LOOK AT
THAT SHINE, HUH?

11:53.246 --> 11:56.950
- YEAH. GREAT CAR,
ISN'T IT, RAY?

11:56.984 --> 11:59.152
- AH, YOU JUST GOT TO
SPEND SOME TIME WITH HER,

11:59.186 --> 12:00.253
GET TO KNOW HER.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.322
- UH-HUH.

12:02.355 --> 12:07.761
AND YOU KNOW HER
PRETTY WELL, DON'T YOU?

12:07.795 --> 12:10.030
- EVERY INCH OF HER.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.035
YOU KNOW, I LEARNED
HOW TO DRIVE IN THIS CAR.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.304
- WHAT ELSE
DID YOU LEARN, RAY?

12:17.337 --> 12:18.906
- WELL, I LEARNED THAT YOU
GOT TO BE PATIENT, YOU KNOW?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.207
YOU CAN'T JUST JUMP IN

12:20.240 --> 12:23.010
AND EXPECT HER
TO TURN OVER RIGHT AWAY.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.381
- IS THAT RIGHT?

12:28.415 --> 12:29.382
- YEAH.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.952
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER
TO WARM HER UP, YOU KNOW,

12:31.985 --> 12:32.853
OTHERWISE
SHE'LL QUIT ON YOU.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.988
- ALL RIGHT!

12:35.022 --> 12:36.523
OH--EWW!

12:36.556 --> 12:38.425
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.793
- WHAT?
WHAT'D I DO?

12:39.827 --> 12:41.061
- OH, STOP.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.963
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR PAST

12:42.996 --> 12:44.865
AND LISA CONSTANTINE, AND--

12:44.898 --> 12:47.300
OH, YOU MAKE ME SICK, RAY.

12:47.334 --> 12:51.104
- IS--LISA IN TOWN?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.306
- ROBERT TOLD ME.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.507
- OH.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.475
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.577
I TOLD YOU ABOUT
LISA CONSTANTINE YEARS AGO.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.446
- YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME WHERE.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.014
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE'S THE REASON

13:01.048 --> 13:02.816
YOU WANTED
TO KEEP THIS CAR.

13:02.850 --> 13:03.817
AND WHAT'S WORSE,

13:03.851 --> 13:07.554
I'M THE ONE STUCK
DRIVING THIS PIECE OF CRAP.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.356
LUCKY.
UGH!

13:09.389 --> 13:10.257
I'M TAKING IT
TO THE JUNKYARD.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.826
- NO, NO, NO.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.127
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.530
THIS--THIS CAR
ISN'T JUST ABOUT--

13:17.564 --> 13:19.199
LUCK.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.068
IT'S A PART OF ME.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.402
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
IN MY HOUSE.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.873
THIS--THIS USED TO
GET ME AWAY FROM THERE.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.876
WE'D GO TO SHEA STADIUM
AND JONES BEACH.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.078
SOMETIMES WE'D PILE IN THE CAR
AND DRIVE,

13:31.111 --> 13:33.080
JUST TO DRIVE.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.985
WHEN MY FATHER
WAS REALLY MAD AT ME,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.287
HE'D TAKE THE CAR AWAY.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.156
AW, THAT WAS THE WORST THING
THAT YOU COULD DO TO ME.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.192
- OH.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.860
- THIS CAR--

13:46.894 --> 13:48.061
IT WASN'T JUST A CAR.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.030
IT WAS LIKE--

13:50.063 --> 13:51.098
FREEDOM.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.333
IT WAS--

13:53.366 --> 13:55.535
AH, I GUESS THAT'S WHY
I WANT TO KEEP IT.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.536
- WELL, ALL RIGHT.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.205
I MEAN--

13:58.238 --> 13:59.639
I GUESS
I CAN LIVE WITH IT

13:59.672 --> 14:00.540
FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER,

14:00.573 --> 14:02.409
BUT JUST UNTIL
WE GET THE MINIVAN, OKAY?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.044
- UH-UH-UH-UH.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.879
THERE ARE
FINGERPRINTS HERE.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.186
- IS EVERYBODY OKAY
BACK HERE?

14:23.931 --> 14:24.998
- OH, EXCELLENT SONG.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.033
- YEAH.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.500
HEY, GIVE ME YOUR COMB.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.969
- HEY, DON'T MESS AROUND
BACK THERE

14:29.002 --> 14:32.139
UNLESS YOU MEAN BUSINESS.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.976
- JUST LET ME BORROW IT
FOR A SECOND.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.946
I LIKE YOUR HAIR, TOO.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.181
- NOW I NEED THE COMB.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.152
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE IN THE
SAME SPANISH CLASS THIS YEAR.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.186
- YEAH.
ISN'T IT COOL?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.187
- YEAH.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.322
- ISN'T SENOR MURPHY A DORK?

14:49.356 --> 14:51.691

14:51.724 --> 14:53.626

SO FUNNY IN CLASS.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.462

REALLY GOOD, TOO.

14:58.265 --> 15:02.702

UN POQUITO FRIO.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.404
- OH, YOU'RE
A LITTLE COLD?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.106
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD
TAKE YOU HOME.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.341
- NO WAY, JOSE.

15:10.177 --> 15:10.944
- YOU A LITTLE WARMER NOW?

15:10.978 --> 15:12.245
- A LITTLE.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.955
MM, I THINK YOU'RE
GETTING WARMER, TOO.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.923
- THAT'S A BIG 10-4.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.697
- ALL RIGHT, KNOCK IT OFF.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.666
- WHAT, MOMMY?

15:33.700 --> 15:34.667
- NOTHING, HONEY.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.236
MOMMY'S JUST--

15:36.269 --> 15:38.038
HALLUCINATING.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.745
- OW.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.680
- GIVE ME THE KEYS
TO THE GOOD CAR.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.149
COME ON, COME ON.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:49.182 --> 15:52.052
- I'M NOT DRIVING
THAT VALIANT ANYMORE.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.253
- WHY NOT?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.488
- IT'S JUST
A LITTLE TOO--

15:55.522 --> 15:57.724
USED, YOU KNOW?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.227
WHY DON'T YOU DRIVE IT?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.328
IT'S YOUR CAR,
YOUR MEMORIES.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.629
YOU DRIVE IT.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.098
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL DRIVE IT.
FINE.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.233
I DON'T MIND DRIVING IT.
- OKAY, GOOD.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.300
- YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.301
- I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.702
YOU GO ENJOY IT.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.438

LIKE A SETUP FOR ONE OF THESE--

IT'S SO QUEER.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.304

IT'S DISCO.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.106
DISCO SUCKS.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.611
- CAN YOU TURN ON THE HEAT?

16:52.812 --> 16:57.117
- WELL, I THOUGHT WE COULD
WARM EACH OTHER UP,

16:57.150 --> 16:58.785
'CAUSE I'M COLD, TOO.

17:03.423 --> 17:08.161
SO, HERE WE ARE.

ALL OVER FOR YOU.

- OH, HI.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.843
OH, BOY.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.721
I WAS JUST LISTENING
TO THE RADIO.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.624
WHAT, DON'T YOU EVER SIT THERE
AND WAIT FOR THE SONG TO END?

19:17.657 --> 19:21.394
- OH, NO, NOT WITH THAT LOOK
ON MY FACE, I DON'T.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.496
I MEAN, RAY, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD

19:23.530 --> 19:25.432
THAT A MARRIED FATHER OF THREE

19:25.465 --> 19:27.767
CAN'T GIVE UP HIS LUCKY CAR?

19:27.800 --> 19:30.270

A HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.804
YOU STILL HAVE
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

19:31.838 --> 19:35.542
- I DIDN'T SLEEP WITH SOMEONE
ON MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.876
- OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S TOO SMALL.

19:36.909 --> 19:37.877
YOU HAVE TO OPEN IT.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.412
- RAY.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.381
- COME ON,
IT'S JUST A MEMORY.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.516
WHAT MATTERS
IS NOW, RIGHT?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.785
AND THE SEX MEANS
SO MUCH MORE NOW.

19:45.818 --> 19:46.919

- SURE, IT DOES,

19:47.954 --> 19:51.291
'CAUSE IT'S SO RARE.

NO, BECAUSE IT'S YOU.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.498
I'M GOING TO GET RID
OF THE CAR.

- YOU ARE?
- YEAH.

20:00.900 --> 20:01.934
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
