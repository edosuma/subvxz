00:01.200 --> 00:04.025
Sidney?
Where are you going?

00:04.059 --> 00:05.930
Oh, I didn't tell you?
I have a lecture.

00:05.965 --> 00:09.374
Another lecture? They're gonna
have you on the faculty.

00:09.442 --> 00:12.138
I don't mind.
It's good to give back.

00:12.211 --> 00:13.372
You don't owe them anything.

00:13.407 --> 00:15.481
You just gave them
a half a million dollars last year.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.536
That's just writing a check.
I won't be late

00:17.571 --> 00:20.415
- I'll try not to wake you.
- You can wake me.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.680
Good night, Maria.

00:27.727 --> 00:30.423
- Good night, Caroline.
- Have a pleasant evening, sir.

00:30.496 --> 00:32.759
Mrs. Danvers.

00:32.832 --> 00:34.766
Good evening, sir.
Are we all set?

00:34.834 --> 00:37.064
- I think I'll drive myself tonight.
- You want the Volvo?

00:37.136 --> 00:39.138
No, I think I'll take the Ford.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.698
- I'll bring it around.
- Thank you.

"Bad to the bone"

00:52.752 --> 00:55.277
"B-B-B-B-Bad"

00:55.354 --> 00:57.549
"B-B-B-B-Bad"

00:57.623 --> 01:00.091
"B-B-B-B-Bad"

01:00.159 --> 01:02.593
"Bad to the bone"

01:02.661 --> 01:04.992
"I broke a thousand hearts"

01:05.063 --> 01:07.328
"Before I met you"

01:29.255 --> 01:32.247
- So what did you think?
- hate to go first.

01:32.324 --> 01:34.258
- Tell me what you thought.
- I liked it.

01:34.326 --> 01:36.521
I liked it too.

01:36.595 --> 01:39.496
I really liked that actress.
What was her name? - Jean something.

01:42.501 --> 01:45.026
- Okay, where's my car?
- It's over there.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.197
- Give me your wallet.! Now.!
- Oh, my God!

01:47.273 --> 01:49.639
Okay. Everything's cool.

01:49.708 --> 01:52.142
Don't be a hero.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.207
Hey, what are you...

02:08.610 --> 02:12.885
MONK Season 1 Epi. 06
Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger

03:56.150 --> 03:59.653
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to be a single parent?

03:59.688 --> 04:03.646
- Um, no.
- My paycheck bounced, Adrian.

04:05.059 --> 04:07.323
- The lamp...
- What are you gonna do about it?

04:07.395 --> 04:09.886
Guess I'll just have to
sweep it up.

04:09.964 --> 04:11.955
No, I'm talking
about the money.

04:12.032 --> 04:13.785
I thought Leo Otterman paid us.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.934
He gave me an I. O. U.
He said he was a little short.

04:16.003 --> 04:19.529
No, no, no, no.
Leo Otterman is not a little short.

04:19.607 --> 04:23.771
Wejust recovered one ofhis Picasso
paintings that is worth over $2 million.

04:23.844 --> 04:26.711
He said that he wasn't
liquid or whatever.

04:26.781 --> 04:29.477
He had some cash flow thing.

04:29.550 --> 04:34.954
Adrian, this is a business
with clients and expenses.

04:35.022 --> 04:37.456
I know money doesn't matter
on Planet Monk,

04:37.525 --> 04:40.085
but I have a kid
that expects three meals a day...

04:40.161 --> 04:42.595
and sometimes gets sick.

04:43.998 --> 04:46.523
If you miss another paycheck,
I'm quitting.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.434
This is very important,
so I'm gonna say it again.

04:50.504 --> 04:54.873
If you miss one more paycheck,
I'm quitting.

04:54.942 --> 04:57.274
Would you hold that?

04:58.979 --> 05:01.140
Hello? - It better be a job.

05:06.153 --> 05:08.417
Now, don't give in.
Okay?

05:08.489 --> 05:11.049
A 10 percent raise
isn't asking for too much.

05:11.125 --> 05:14.583
You're right. You're right.
Ten percent? You can't argue with that.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.857
And don't solve anything
until they agree.

05:16.931 --> 05:19.161
As soon as you tell them who did it,
we lose our leverage.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.235
You're right. You're right.
Captain!

05:21.270 --> 05:23.637
I see the circus is in town.

05:23.672 --> 05:26.731
Oh, yes. It's gonna get a lot worse.

05:26.807 --> 05:29.074
Captain, Adrian wants to
talk to you about our fee.

05:29.109 --> 05:30.077
That the shooter?

05:30.112 --> 05:32.218
Yeah. Archie Modine.
He's an ex-cop.

05:32.253 --> 05:34.241
He was second lieutenant in Palo Alto.

05:34.315 --> 05:37.079
I already checked him out.
He was a straight-up good cop.

05:37.151 --> 05:39.463
Now he's the head of security
at CK Pharmaceuticals.

05:39.498 --> 05:42.553
Uh, Captain? About our fee,
we want... - Sharona.

05:42.623 --> 05:45.773
- We want to talk...
- Sharona, please. Walk me through it.

05:45.808 --> 05:48.424
It's pretty routine
till we get to the punch line.

05:48.496 --> 05:53.627
Modine and his date are walking
to their car over here.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.829
The, uh, perp is over here.

05:56.904 --> 06:00.465
Now, the perp pops out with a knife.
Modine pulls out his piece.

06:00.541 --> 06:03.908
.38 caliber. I already called.
He's licensed.

06:03.978 --> 06:06.071
Bang, bang, bang.
Three in the chest.

06:06.146 --> 06:09.582
So I just have one question.
What am I doing here?

06:09.650 --> 06:12.346
Here comes the punch line.

06:12.419 --> 06:15.286
Our perp... is Sidney Teal.

06:16.657 --> 06:18.887
The computer guy?

06:18.959 --> 06:22.554
- Get out of town.
- Take a look.

06:27.835 --> 06:31.134
That's what $5 billion looks like.

06:31.205 --> 06:33.765
Get out of town.

06:33.841 --> 06:36.503
What in God's name
was he doing?

06:36.577 --> 06:38.568
I think maybe...

06:38.646 --> 06:41.137
that this is how
he got his kicks.

06:41.215 --> 06:43.445
That kind of money
can make a person crazy.

06:43.517 --> 06:45.485
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

06:45.553 --> 06:47.748
Yeah, right.

06:47.821 --> 06:49.865
Anyway, that's my theory.
If you've got a better one,

06:49.900 --> 06:53.618
- I'd really like to hear it.
- Well... - No. No.

06:53.694 --> 06:57.357
Captain, we can't start working
until we talk about our fee.

06:57.431 --> 06:59.524
Sharona, could you
give me a second here?

07:01.769 --> 07:03.239
You know, this is insane.

07:03.274 --> 07:07.464
Yeah, it's crazy.
It gets crazier. Check this out.

07:08.909 --> 07:11.275
- This guy's wearin' knee pads.
- Knee pads?

07:11.345 --> 07:12.735
Yeah, and he's got elbow pads.

07:12.770 --> 07:16.544
Was he planning on going
Rollerblading after?

07:16.617 --> 07:19.382
- I live right up there.
- Sir, sir, sir. Excuse me. Just step back.

07:19.417 --> 07:22.380
Okay. So you were coming out of the
theater and heading toward your car?

07:22.456 --> 07:25.357
That's right. I had my keys out,
which now I can't find.

07:25.426 --> 07:27.792
Excuse me, sir.

07:27.861 --> 07:30.193
- Are these yours?
- Yeah.

07:30.264 --> 07:32.459
That's great. Thanks.
I appreciate it.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.558
Hey, Mr. Modine.
Uh, what happened next?

07:34.635 --> 07:37.195
Well, he came at me with a knife,
and he...he said something.

07:37.271 --> 07:40.638
- He said, "Don't be a hero."
- "Don't be a hero?"

07:40.708 --> 07:43.677
Yeah. - Anyway, I pulled my piece
and I got three rounds off.

07:43.744 --> 07:46.212
Guess he didn't realize he was
messing with a second lieutenant.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.184
I just live right up there.
I saw the whole thing.

07:48.219 --> 07:49.909
That's exactly what happened.

07:49.984 --> 07:53.420
Hey, Lieutenant.
Is that really Sidney Teal?

07:53.487 --> 07:55.682
- I'm afraid so.
- Geez.

07:55.756 --> 07:58.816
Five hundred dollars a day,
plus expenses.

07:58.892 --> 08:01.417
Well, I think that's more than fair.
He's never had a raise.

08:01.495 --> 08:03.690
I can't authorize an increase
like this, Sharona.

08:03.764 --> 08:06.858
You're gonna have to take this downtown.
Talk to Shelly Berger, your pal.

08:06.934 --> 08:09.835
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
We'll deal with it later.

08:09.903 --> 08:12.394
Can I say something?

08:12.473 --> 08:15.465
I'd like to file a complaint
against one of your cops.

08:15.542 --> 08:18.102
Excuse me? - There was a cop
standing right over there...

08:18.178 --> 08:19.941
who saw the entire thing.

08:20.014 --> 08:23.108
After Archie shot the guy,
the cop just turned and ran away.

08:23.183 --> 08:25.913
- Did you get a badge number?
- I'm afraid I didn't.

08:25.986 --> 08:30.047
Captain! - Do you have a policy for
a police officerjust to flee like that?

08:30.124 --> 08:32.751
I have no comment
because it's ridiculous. All right?

08:32.826 --> 08:35.317
There is not an officer on this force...

08:35.395 --> 08:38.482
that would run away from the
scene of a crime. It is inconceivable.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.801
I know, but I saw!
He ran away!

08:41.869 --> 08:45.305
- I saw it too. He ran away.
- Why would an officer flee the scene?

08:45.372 --> 08:47.135
Are you covering something up?
What's going on?

08:47.170 --> 08:48.933
Captain, what's going on?

08:49.977 --> 08:52.104
- Speed limit's 35.
- I am going 35.

08:52.179 --> 08:54.300
Thirty-seven. Thirty-eight now.

08:54.335 --> 08:56.616
Why couldn't you just
hold out for the raise?

08:56.684 --> 08:58.618
I can't believe you folded
like a cheap suit.

08:58.686 --> 09:01.416
Tent. For the record,
I folded like a cheap tent.

09:01.488 --> 09:03.683
- Did you call Leo Otterman?
- I haven't been able to reach him.

09:03.757 --> 09:07.659
- "Yield." The sign says "yield."
- There's nobody there.

09:07.728 --> 09:09.489
I mean, you're the best
detective in the free

09:09.490 --> 09:11.289
world, and you can't
find one deadbeat client?

09:11.365 --> 09:13.299
What's that noise?

09:13.367 --> 09:16.461
- It's the alternator.
- Why don't you have it fixed?

09:16.537 --> 09:18.402
Oh.

09:18.472 --> 09:21.305
Okay. Here's plan "B."

09:21.375 --> 09:24.071
We are gonna solve this case
as fast as we can, okay?

09:24.144 --> 09:27.341
A billionaire with too much
time on his hands went crazy.

09:27.414 --> 09:29.159
I don't know.
What about the knee pads?

09:29.194 --> 09:30.906
No, no, no. Forget the knee pads.

09:30.984 --> 09:33.316
A billionaire went crazy,
and that's it.

09:33.387 --> 09:36.379
We're gonna take credit
for it this time, get a little publicity,

09:36.457 --> 09:38.811
and then I'm gonna call
Sheldon Berger in the mayor's office

09:38.846 --> 09:41.114
and demand a 10 percent increase.

09:45.699 --> 09:48.259
Speaking of money...
Whoa!

09:48.335 --> 09:50.166
We are in the wrong business.

09:50.237 --> 09:53.502
Not just us. Everybody in the world,
except this guy,

09:53.574 --> 09:55.599
is in the wrong business.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.668
We're building a guesthouse
in the backyard.

09:58.746 --> 10:00.771
I was supposed to meet
with an architect today.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.009
Do you know what I did instead?

10:05.119 --> 10:07.314
I made funeral arrangements.

10:07.387 --> 10:10.754
I know it's a terrible time, Mrs. Teal.

10:10.824 --> 10:14.783
We... We just have
a couple of questions.

10:14.862 --> 10:17.422
Yeah, um, the police think...

10:17.498 --> 10:20.558
- that Sidney was having a midlife crisis.
- That's true.

10:20.634 --> 10:23.296
It started about
a year and a half ago.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.304
Sidney just changed.

10:25.372 --> 10:29.274
He started trying new things,
crazy things...

10:29.343 --> 10:31.573
renting motorcycles and...

10:31.645 --> 10:35.081
bungeejumping,
skydiving.

10:35.149 --> 10:37.583
He said he loved
the rush of it.

10:37.651 --> 10:42.179
- He loved the rush?
- Well, I used to say I married Batman.

10:43.466 --> 10:47.387
I never imagined in a million years
that he'd do anything like this.

10:47.461 --> 10:52.057
Robbing someone with a knife.
I don't know what he was thinking.

10:52.132 --> 10:56.228
Adrian, my sister has this same
painting on her shower curtain.

10:56.303 --> 10:58.294
Huh.

11:02.109 --> 11:05.010
And did he go out often...
at night, alone?

11:05.078 --> 11:09.208
The police asked me
that same question. Um, recently...

11:09.283 --> 11:11.547
he started going out late.

11:11.618 --> 11:15.110
Once or twice a week.
He always had a good excuse.

11:15.189 --> 11:17.123
I feel like an idiot, really.

11:17.191 --> 11:20.786
Why do you think he was
wearing knee pads last night?

11:20.861 --> 11:22.795
I have no idea.

11:22.863 --> 11:25.525
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must look terrible.

11:25.599 --> 11:29.296
Oh, no. No, no.
You look fine.

11:29.369 --> 11:31.997
- Thank you.
- I just have one more question.

11:32.072 --> 11:34.438
When did your husband
start wearing eyeglasses?

11:34.508 --> 11:38.410
About three years ago,
I guess. Why?

11:38.478 --> 11:40.469
No reason.

11:42.616 --> 11:44.584
Why did you ask
about his glasses?

11:44.651 --> 11:47.518
So I could tell which photographs
were the most recent.

11:47.588 --> 11:49.522
There are about 200 pictures
in that room.

11:49.590 --> 11:52.150
- They documented everything.
- And?

11:52.226 --> 11:54.592
No bungee jumping.
No skydiving.

11:54.661 --> 11:58.427
The most exciting thing Sidney Teal's done
in the last two years is go to Disneyland.

11:58.498 --> 12:01.558
- Not exactly Batman.
- This guy?

12:01.635 --> 12:03.933
He was...
What's the opposite of Batman?

12:04.004 --> 12:06.029
You are.

12:13.013 --> 12:16.176
Damn it, I hate this car!
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

12:16.250 --> 12:20.519
Why don't you try saying "Damn it"
a few more times? That might help.

12:20.587 --> 12:23.420
And how long have you
worked for Mr. Teal?

12:23.490 --> 12:25.692
Seven years.
Who am I talking to?

12:25.727 --> 12:27.922
- Oh, I'm not a cop.
- I knew that.

12:27.995 --> 12:31.021
- Cops take care of their cars.
- He's a private consultant.

12:31.098 --> 12:34.090
The police call him in whenever
they're stumped. - Oh, yeah?

12:34.167 --> 12:36.169
Well, join the club.
I'm stumped too.

12:36.204 --> 12:39.138
- Could you hold that?
- Excuse me?

12:39.206 --> 12:42.039
Could you hold that for a sec?

12:44.845 --> 12:47.109
So do you believe
what they're saying...

12:47.180 --> 12:50.377
that Mr. Teal had a dark side,
a secret life?

12:50.450 --> 12:54.284
Mr. Teal didn't have a life
except for his computers.

12:54.354 --> 12:57.028
Boy Scouts used to laugh at him.
You know, he didn't drink,

12:57.063 --> 13:00.989
he didn't smoke, he wouldn't even let
me start the car until we both buckled up.

13:01.061 --> 13:02.688
Did he have much of a temper?

13:02.763 --> 13:05.129
Huh? No.

13:05.198 --> 13:08.690
Mr. Teal... He was a pussycat.
Here's an example.

13:08.769 --> 13:11.932
Last year there was a...
there was a break-in down the street,

13:12.005 --> 13:14.303
and Mr. Teal bought a gun
for protection.

13:14.374 --> 13:17.673
- Wait a minute. He owned a gun?
- He owned it, but he never used it.

13:17.744 --> 13:19.949
I drove him to the practice range, right?

13:19.984 --> 13:22.733
He couldn't even pull the trigger.
He just froze up.

13:23.216 --> 13:25.980
So, how do you explain last night?

13:27.387 --> 13:29.333
Must have been hypnotized,
most I can figure out.

13:29.368 --> 13:31.863
- That could make sense.
- No, you can't hypnotize someone

13:31.898 --> 13:33.791
to do something they wouldn't
ordinarily do.

13:33.860 --> 13:36.920
What about Mrs. Teal.
Would you say she was a pussycat?

13:36.997 --> 13:38.965
No, she's more like a tiger.

13:39.032 --> 13:42.126
But I never worked for her.
I worked for him. She made that clear.

13:42.202 --> 13:46.332
Look, truth is, I'll be
out of a job soon, so...

13:46.406 --> 13:48.931
if you're looking for a driver,
let me know.

13:49.009 --> 13:52.342
- Hey, is he a good boss?
- Well, my last paycheck bounced.

13:52.412 --> 13:55.210
I can't take a vacation
because he can't live without me.

13:55.282 --> 13:58.342
And two nights ago
he called me at 4:00 a. M...

13:58.418 --> 14:00.545
because he saw a cockroach.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.554
It was pretty big. - Yeah.

14:03.980 --> 14:05.548
Try it now.

14:11.298 --> 14:14.290
- Ah, that should be all right for a while.
- What do we owe you?

14:15.936 --> 14:19.394
You want to thank me?
Find out what happened to my boss.

14:19.473 --> 14:21.737
You know, it's funny.

14:21.808 --> 14:23.742
Mr. Teal had it all.

14:23.810 --> 14:27.268
More money than God,
a beautiful wife.

14:27.347 --> 14:30.874
But he was the loneliest man
in the world.

14:30.951 --> 14:33.749
I was the chauffeur,
and I felt sorry for him.

14:33.820 --> 14:35.788
You felt sorry for your boss?

14:35.856 --> 14:39.815
I can only imagine what that would
feel like. - Get in the car.

14:39.893 --> 14:42.885
- I'm gonna do what I can.
- Thank you.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.033
Captain. - You just missed
the deputy commissioner.

14:56.103 --> 14:59.630
Guess what he wanted to talk about?
Murder rates sparking?

14:59.707 --> 15:01.766
The Sidney Teal investigation? No.

15:01.842 --> 15:04.756
All he wanted to know was what
we're doing about the runaway cop.

15:04.791 --> 15:06.295
Fraidy Cop.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.948
- Excuse me?
- That's what they're calling him.

15:11.018 --> 15:14.146
We, uh, sort of pieced together
the route he took.

15:14.221 --> 15:17.588
I don't know. Okay.

15:17.658 --> 15:20.252
After the shooting,
three people saw him...

15:20.327 --> 15:22.454
running west
towards the park here,

15:22.530 --> 15:26.057
and on 19th, here,
he flagged down a taxi.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.346
- He took a taxi?
- Yeah, it gets worse.

15:28.381 --> 15:30.160
He, uh, threw up in the backseat.

15:30.237 --> 15:32.569
But we did get his blood type
from the vomit.

15:33.409 --> 15:38.842
The taxi then, uh, dropped him off...
at a bar upon Geary Street... there,

15:38.913 --> 15:42.314
where he sat in a booth at the back,
apparently drinking bourbon and crying.

15:42.383 --> 15:45.784
- He was crying? Oh, dear Lord.
- About midnight,

15:45.853 --> 15:49.311
an older woman in a brown station wagon
was seen picking him up.

15:49.390 --> 15:51.381
Possibly his mother.

15:52.927 --> 15:56.590
He called his mom? - Yeah.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.929
Well, that son of a bitch
better hope I don't find him first.

16:04.805 --> 16:07.774
Why don't you put those,
uh, over there?

16:07.842 --> 16:10.436
Thank you.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.709
- He certainly had a lot of friends.
- It's been overwhelming.

16:14.782 --> 16:19.048
These are from Bill Gates.
Those are from the governor.

16:19.119 --> 16:21.815
And look at all these letters.

16:21.889 --> 16:24.551
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

16:24.625 --> 16:28.527
This one was sticking up.
You'll thank me later.

16:29.730 --> 16:32.062
How long have you worked
for Mr. Teal?

16:32.132 --> 16:33.988
I was with him from the beginning...

16:34.023 --> 16:37.297
the very beginning, when he was
working out of his garage.

16:38.839 --> 16:42.172
He was probably happier there.
We only had two phone lines.

16:43.410 --> 16:45.401
We had to fill
all the orders ourselves.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.843
That's his autobiography.
You can have one.

16:51.477 --> 16:54.319
Sidney loved signing them
for people.

16:55.296 --> 16:56.390
Now what are you doing?

16:56.425 --> 17:00.258
I made that one too short,
so now I have to cut the others.

17:00.327 --> 17:03.230
Make 'em all even.
I'm sure you understand.

17:03.265 --> 17:06.133
When was the last time
you talked to Mr. Teal? - That evening.

17:06.167 --> 17:09.403
Um, he called on his way home
to ask about Tony Bennett.

17:09.438 --> 17:11.496
Not... The singer, Tony Bennett?

17:11.571 --> 17:15.838
Myra's a big fan. Sidney was taking
her to Vegas to see his show.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.606
He was arranging for Tony Bennett
to meet them at the airport.

17:18.679 --> 17:21.671
- Wow. Tony Bennett.
- He was going to surprise her.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.444
He loved doing that.

17:24.518 --> 17:28.511
Mrs. Butterworth, do you have any idea what
Sidney Teal was doing in that parking lot?

17:28.589 --> 17:31.524
No. I still can't believe it happened.

17:31.592 --> 17:36.529
I'm still in denial.
Mugging somebody. For what? Maybe $40?

17:36.597 --> 17:40.328
Well, maybe he went crazy.
Do you think that's possible, Mr. Monk?

17:40.401 --> 17:43.564
For a man to be normal one day
and then suddenly go crazy?

17:43.637 --> 17:46.902
Yes!

17:46.974 --> 17:48.965
I meant the...

17:53.881 --> 17:56.577
This is the fifth store, Adrian.

17:56.650 --> 17:58.584
I have a good feeling
about this place.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.417
Oh. What about this one?

18:04.491 --> 18:07.585
Nah. The other one was silver
and it swiveled.

18:07.661 --> 18:09.865
- You don't have to buy the exact
same lamp. - What do you mean?

18:09.900 --> 18:12.431
- You could buy a different lamp.
- Different lamp?

18:12.499 --> 18:15.127
Yeah. Adrian, what about
this one? This is great.

18:15.202 --> 18:17.432
Yeah, but it's not silver.
The other one was sliver.

18:17.504 --> 18:20.667
It's just a lamp. If you were blindfolded,
you wouldn't know the difference.

18:20.741 --> 18:23.175
If I was blindfolded,
why would I need a lamp?

18:23.243 --> 18:26.576
Okay, that was a bad example.
Look, they're all basically the same.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.480
- What about this one? This is great.
- Yeah, but it doesn't swivel.

18:29.550 --> 18:31.745
The other one swiveled.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.755
I think you should try
something different for a change.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.485
They probably don't even make
your stupid lamp anymore.

18:38.559 --> 18:42.586
- What do you mean?
- Maybe it's been discontinued.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.858
Discontinued?

18:44.932 --> 18:46.923
Why don't you buy a lamp factory
and make your own?

18:47.001 --> 18:51.199
It'd only cost you $500,000,
but at least you'd have your precious lamp.

18:51.271 --> 18:55.367
There it is. This is it.

18:55.442 --> 18:58.843
- You're buying three?
- Two are backups.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.879
Why don't you fill out
an application? - Maybe I will.

19:05.886 --> 19:08.198
$95.75.

19:10.111 --> 19:13.458
- Would you mind? I'll pay you back.
- Where's your wallet?

19:13.527 --> 19:15.688
I'm having it,
you know, buffed.

19:15.763 --> 19:18.789
Oh! - Look at that face.

19:18.866 --> 19:22.267
There's no way this guy
walked on the wild side. No way.

19:22.336 --> 19:25.362
I don't know.
People surprise you.

19:25.439 --> 19:27.839
You know,

19:27.908 --> 19:29.085
when we were in his office,

19:29.120 --> 19:32.402
I saw some flowers from
his old fraternity, Phi Beta Tau.

19:32.479 --> 19:34.413
I used to date a guy from that frat.

19:34.481 --> 19:37.917
It was pretty intense.
He told me about two guys...

19:37.985 --> 19:40.351
who almost died during initiation.

19:40.421 --> 19:42.321
There was, like,
these secret ceremonies

19:42.356 --> 19:45.325
and weird handshakes.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.919
Look who I'm talking to about
weird handshakes. - Excuse me.

19:47.995 --> 19:51.692
It's declined. We accept cash.

19:51.765 --> 19:54.011
Adrian, this is unacceptable.

19:54.046 --> 19:56.725
It is just unacceptable.
You have to pay me.

19:58.539 --> 20:01.201
Did you try calling
Leo Otterman again? Huh?

20:01.275 --> 20:03.416
Did you?

20:03.646 --> 20:05.177
What's wrong?

20:05.245 --> 20:07.213
On his key chain...

20:07.281 --> 20:10.114
he had an insignia,
Phi Beta Tau.

20:10.184 --> 20:12.118
W... Well, who did?

20:12.186 --> 20:16.555
The guy...The guy who shot Teal.
Archie Modine.

20:16.623 --> 20:20.787
They were in the same
fraternity. Oh, my God. - What?

20:20.861 --> 20:23.762
They knew each other.

20:25.499 --> 20:28.957
This was a lot more enjoyable
when I was on that side of the table.

20:29.036 --> 20:32.096
Oh, you're on the right side
of the table, Modine.

20:32.172 --> 20:36.040
Look, Captain,
I'm not lawyering up here, am I?

20:36.110 --> 20:39.273
I'm talking to you. All right?
I screwed up. I admitted it.

20:39.346 --> 20:41.837
Oh, yeah.
He screwed up.

20:41.915 --> 20:44.611
I withheld information.

20:44.685 --> 20:48.121
I filed a false report. All right?
L-I... I knew the guy.

20:48.188 --> 20:50.918
Yeah, why the hell didn't you
tell us that before?

20:51.992 --> 20:55.155
I was protecting... a friend.

20:55.229 --> 20:57.060
Mrs. Teal.

20:57.131 --> 21:01.067
That's right. I mean, I just didn't want
to drag her into all this.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.330
You understand that.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.464
Maybe not.

21:08.542 --> 21:11.272
I just didn't think anybody would
connect us. I mean, how did you find out?

21:11.345 --> 21:14.178
We had a little help.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.579
Sidney Teal was two years
ahead of me at Cal State.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.677
We were in the same frat,
but I didn't really know him.

21:20.754 --> 21:23.780
- How did you meet his wife?
- Fund-raiser for the college. You know.

21:23.857 --> 21:28.658
Sidney was in the spotlight,
but my interest was more in Myra.

21:28.729 --> 21:31.027
And as the kids say,
we hooked up.

21:31.098 --> 21:35.000
It was a fling.
I mean, I hardly remember it.

21:35.068 --> 21:37.798
Teal must have found out
and-and, you know...

21:37.871 --> 21:39.106
Oh, come on, Captain.

21:39.141 --> 21:41.534
He came at me with a knife.
What would you do?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.968
Sidney Teal did not suffer
a nervous breakdown.

21:47.047 --> 21:50.141
The incident on Harrison Place was,
in fact, a crime of passion.

21:50.217 --> 21:55.222
We believe that Mr. Teal
was, in fact, trying to murder Mr. Modine,

21:55.257 --> 21:59.358
who was linked romantically
at one time...with Mr. Teal's wife, Myra.

21:59.426 --> 22:02.862
Over the next 10 days, the D. A. 's office
is going to decide whether or not...

22:02.930 --> 22:04.604
they want to press charges
against Mr. Modine

22:04.639 --> 22:07.939
for filing a false report.
Any questions?

22:07.974 --> 22:10.135
Captain, is there any news
on Fraidy Cop?

22:11.763 --> 22:12.695
No comment.

22:12.773 --> 22:14.625
There's a story in today's
Tribune that says the

22:14.626 --> 22:16.402
department knows the
identity of Fraidy Cop...

22:16.476 --> 22:19.502
but is refusing to release it.
Is that true, Captain?

22:21.949 --> 22:23.940
No comment.

22:26.987 --> 22:31.083
All right. Hey, hey. Hang on.
I have another statement. Here it is.

22:31.158 --> 22:34.992
The next reporter that asks me
about this so-called Fraidy Cop...

22:35.062 --> 22:38.054
is going to be banned from all
press conferences for a year.

22:43.270 --> 22:46.831
Here's our invoice for the Teal case.
We'd like to get paid.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.432
- Don't you usually just mail this in?
- We're in a rush.

22:49.509 --> 22:52.501
- A little short, huh?
- Yeah. So are you.

22:52.579 --> 22:56.106
Just initial it where it says,
"job completed to satisfaction," please.

22:56.183 --> 22:59.050
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no. It's not over.

22:59.119 --> 23:02.919
Don't do this. The case is closed.
You heard the press conference.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.424
- He owned a gun.
- Who did?

23:05.492 --> 23:08.222
Sidney Teal. If he wanted to kill
Archie Modine in that parking lot,

23:08.295 --> 23:10.786
- why didn't he bring the gun?
- I don't know. He brought a knife.

23:10.864 --> 23:13.856
It wasn't a very big knife.
It only had a four-inch blade.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.027
And I don't think
Teal knew about that affair.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.469
He was planning a romantic
getaway with his wife, remember?

23:18.538 --> 23:21.803
Look, we need to get paid.
I need cash.

23:21.875 --> 23:24.969
The stores in my neighborhood
insist on money.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.441
I'm sorry.

23:32.519 --> 23:34.612
I'm really, really sorry.

23:34.688 --> 23:37.953
I can't. There's more to it.

23:38.025 --> 23:41.984
If you don't submit that invoice,
I'm quitting.

23:42.062 --> 23:47.830
Now, I'm going to give you until three.
No, not 3:00. I'm counting to three.

23:48.893 --> 23:51.803
One, two,

23:53.707 --> 23:55.698
three.

23:58.512 --> 24:00.980
Call me the minute
you grow up.

24:09.890 --> 24:11.824
What should I do?

24:12.810 --> 24:14.884
I don't know.

24:14.961 --> 24:17.486
No. Tell me what to do.

24:17.564 --> 24:21.193
- I can't do that.
- Well,

24:21.268 --> 24:24.260
can you find somebody
who will tell me what to do?

25:15.200 --> 25:19.261
So this Fraidy Cop situation
is getting out of control.

25:19.337 --> 25:20.283
The San Francisco P. D.

25:20.318 --> 25:23.569
Just bought a bunch of new squad
cars that only go in reverse.

25:23.641 --> 25:27.338
You know what I heard: Every officer
is being issued some new equipment...

25:27.412 --> 25:29.403
a white flag and a diaper.!

25:29.481 --> 25:32.848
But they better do it up tight,
'cause there's a cold snap coming.

25:36.350 --> 25:39.376
A drive-by shooting?
Do they have any leads?

25:39.453 --> 25:43.253
Nothing on the bullets.
They found the car a few blocks away.

25:43.324 --> 25:46.725
Stolen. A hundred percent
clean. No prints.

25:46.794 --> 25:49.262
You know, you-you-you
don't seem very upset.

25:49.330 --> 25:52.424
Well, it means I'm making
someone very uneasy,

25:52.500 --> 25:54.593
and that's not such a bad thing.

25:54.668 --> 25:57.102
Well, Sh-Sharona
must have been terrified.

25:57.171 --> 25:59.105
She quit.

25:59.173 --> 26:01.869
We had an argument about money.

26:01.942 --> 26:05.776
She took a job at a lamp store on
Prospect Street. She'd rather sell lamps...

26:05.846 --> 26:08.406
than work for me.

26:08.482 --> 26:11.178
Let me ask you something.
Two weeks ago,

26:11.252 --> 26:13.345
she bought me this mug,

26:13.420 --> 26:15.513
it said "World's Greatest Boss."

26:15.589 --> 26:19.650
Are you allowed to do that...
buy someone a mug and then just quit?

26:19.727 --> 26:23.527
See, I don't think mugs
are legally binding, Adrian.

26:23.597 --> 26:25.724
I never had to think about money.

26:25.799 --> 26:27.960
Trudy used to pay all the bills.

26:28.035 --> 26:30.026
While we're on that subject,

26:30.104 --> 26:32.766
there-there is something
that-that I have to say.

26:32.840 --> 26:36.037
Oh? Now, you see,
this can't be good.

26:36.110 --> 26:40.012
Well, no.
The-The-The-The fact is that, um,

26:40.080 --> 26:44.346
you see, I haven't been paid
for the past nine weeks, nine sessions.

26:44.418 --> 26:47.717
- Now, that's a lot of money.
- Oh, my God.

26:47.788 --> 26:51.224
- You're gonna leave me too.
- No, no, no. I did not say that, Adrian.

26:51.292 --> 26:55.126
I'm gonna be all alone.
What a time to be me.

26:55.196 --> 26:57.790
Adrian, I promise you,
no one is leaving you.

26:57.865 --> 27:00.800
Sharona did.

27:00.868 --> 27:03.359
Are-Are-Are you okay?

27:03.437 --> 27:07.464
I hate owing you money.
I just... I just hate it.

27:07.541 --> 27:09.702
Listen,

27:09.777 --> 27:13.213
until... until we get squared away,

27:13.280 --> 27:15.908
I'm gonna have to start
seeing you twice a week.

27:31.031 --> 27:34.398
Uh, excuse me? Miss?
We're closing.

27:34.468 --> 27:36.698
- Now?
- That's right.

27:36.770 --> 27:38.965
- What for?
- The holiday.

27:39.039 --> 27:40.973
What holiday?

27:41.041 --> 27:43.066
It's Lamp Day.

28:01.694 --> 28:03.359
How was your day?

28:05.099 --> 28:07.260
I bought a lamp.

28:07.334 --> 28:10.030
Three, actually.

28:44.772 --> 28:48.799
I've been meaning to buy the book.
Did it really mention me? Drink your milk.

28:48.876 --> 28:51.868
Yeah, it was just
one line in chapter three.

28:51.945 --> 28:54.311
He said he loved you.

28:54.381 --> 28:56.576
I'm surprised
he even remembers me.

28:56.650 --> 29:00.643
We only dated, like,
two or three times.

29:00.721 --> 29:01.903
Sidney was a junior.

29:01.938 --> 29:05.420
You know, you could already tell that he
was gonna be rich or famous.

29:05.492 --> 29:09.258
The guy was a genius.
I should've married the schlub.

29:09.330 --> 29:12.788
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh, hold on one sec.

29:12.866 --> 29:16.427
- He was a junior...
- Can I ask you something?

29:16.503 --> 29:19.165
- Yeah.
- Is this your first case?

29:19.239 --> 29:23.608
Uh, no. But I usually
work with a partner.

29:29.083 --> 29:30.613
I'm looking for Kelly Street.

29:30.648 --> 29:33.019
Oh, Kelly's not home.
I'm her sister, Bonnie.

29:33.087 --> 29:36.250
- Ah. My name...
- It doesn't matter. Come on in.

29:36.323 --> 29:38.314
Thank you.

29:39.927 --> 29:42.760
Kelly should be back any minute.

29:42.830 --> 29:44.798
Can I get you anything?

29:44.865 --> 29:48.301
We have, uh, Hi-C
or grape juice.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.599
Oh, how about some
homemade applesauce?

29:50.671 --> 29:53.504
No. I'm fine.
I'm just perfect.

29:53.574 --> 29:57.203
So, you say your wife
was a writer.

29:57.277 --> 30:00.508
Yeah, she was a columnist
for the Examiner.

30:00.581 --> 30:02.947
She died four years ago.
She was murdered.

30:03.016 --> 30:05.484
Oh, dear.
What's the world coming to?

30:05.552 --> 30:07.884
I don't know, ma'am.
I ask myself that every day.

30:07.955 --> 30:10.480
This... This was from...

30:10.557 --> 30:12.616
from her appointment book.

30:12.693 --> 30:15.127
See, this was her last entry.
I always thought...

30:15.195 --> 30:18.460
that 530 Kelly Street
was an address,

30:18.532 --> 30:21.057
but then this morning It hit me.

30:21.135 --> 30:23.069
It's a name... Kelly Street.

30:23.137 --> 30:26.732
Well, her real name's Katrina.
I was the first one to call her Kelly.

30:26.807 --> 30:30.709
Right. And-And the 530
is not a house number.

30:30.778 --> 30:33.076
It means half past 5:00,
of course.

30:33.147 --> 30:36.878
So Trudy must have been planning
to meet your sister on that day.

30:36.950 --> 30:39.350
Something about a Mr. Simon.
You see?

30:39.420 --> 30:41.411
Who... Who is that?

30:41.488 --> 30:43.422
Is that a friend of the family?

30:43.490 --> 30:46.516
- Mr. Simon was her dog.
- Dog?

30:46.593 --> 30:50.529
When Mr. Simon passed away and died,
Kelly couldn't bear to bury him,

30:50.597 --> 30:53.088
so she had him stuffed.

30:53.167 --> 30:54.732
Some people found it peculiar

30:54.767 --> 30:57.866
Your wife was probably writing
a little story about her.

30:57.938 --> 31:00.372
Um, do you mind if I touch him?

31:00.441 --> 31:03.410
Oh, of course.

31:07.047 --> 31:10.710
Taxidermy always fascinated me.

31:12.953 --> 31:16.047
- What are you doing?
- That...

31:16.123 --> 31:18.990
That's not Mr. Simon, silly billy.

31:19.059 --> 31:20.686
- That's the Colonel.
- The Colonel.

31:20.761 --> 31:23.958
This is Mr. Simon.

31:25.933 --> 31:28.527
Oh.! Company.!

31:28.602 --> 31:32.231
Oh, thank God.
Are you Kelly Street? Mrs. Kelly Street?

31:32.306 --> 31:34.297
You don't remember me?

31:34.374 --> 31:36.535
I'm-I'm sorry.

31:36.610 --> 31:39.704
Mr. Monk,
you've been here three times.

31:39.780 --> 31:42.647
You come every year
asking about your wife.

31:45.853 --> 31:48.549
Oh, dear.

31:51.225 --> 31:54.558
You should write it down,
Mr. Monk...

31:54.628 --> 31:56.960
so you don't forget.

31:57.030 --> 31:59.692
You're right.

31:59.766 --> 32:02.394
You're right. I...

32:02.469 --> 32:04.460
must have blocked it out.

32:07.730 --> 32:11.277
In the book, Mr. Teal said
somebody mugged you on your first date,

32:11.345 --> 32:14.872
but he didn't really...
give any details.

32:14.948 --> 32:18.384
Technically, we weren't mugged.
We were almost mugged.

32:20.554 --> 32:23.022
I was scared to death.
I just froze.

32:23.090 --> 32:25.786
- He had a knife.
- He had a knife?

32:25.859 --> 32:28.657
But Sidney,
he lunged at the guy.

32:28.729 --> 32:31.357
- They started fighting.
- Come on!

32:32.900 --> 32:34.959
I couldn't believe it.

32:35.035 --> 32:38.232
Sidney really stood up to him.
I didn't think he had it in him.

32:38.305 --> 32:40.671
Did he say anything?

32:40.741 --> 32:42.675
Who? - The mugger.

32:43.877 --> 32:46.209
Oh, geez.
That was 20 years ago.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.680
Uh, I think he said,

32:48.749 --> 32:51.149
you know,
"Give me your money.

32:51.218 --> 32:53.584
Don't be a hero."

32:54.588 --> 32:57.421
He said that?
"Don't be a hero"?

32:57.491 --> 32:59.925
Yeah. Is that important?

32:59.993 --> 33:02.826
Oh, yeah. That is...
That is very important.

33:02.896 --> 33:04.830
Um...

33:07.200 --> 33:09.600
I think I just busted
this case wide open.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.875
That's better.

33:42.589 --> 33:45.490
Leo? Leo?

33:45.558 --> 33:48.186
Leo! Leo!

33:48.261 --> 33:50.991
Leo.! Leo Otterman.!

33:51.064 --> 33:54.932
Hi. You remember me?
I'm... I'm Adrian Monk.

33:55.001 --> 33:57.936
- Of course I remember you.
- Yeah, yeah, I-I found your Picasso,

33:58.004 --> 34:00.734
and I still have not been paid.

34:00.807 --> 34:01.756
I told you, I need a little more time.

34:01.791 --> 34:03.401
Yeah, Leo, and I'm telling you...

34:03.476 --> 34:06.036
that that is not good enough,
sir, okay?

34:06.112 --> 34:08.808
Okay, look, Leo.
Sharona quit again,

34:08.882 --> 34:11.268
and I went to see Kelly Street...

34:11.304 --> 34:13.163
because I thought
she was an address,

34:13.197 --> 34:15.763
but she's-she's not an address.
She's-She's a woman.

34:15.797 --> 34:18.286
I've been there before three times.

34:18.358 --> 34:22.692
Forget that. Just forget all that.
Sharona was not there.

34:22.762 --> 34:26.891
I can't pay her, see.
And I cannot do this without her.

34:26.966 --> 34:31.096
Thank you for sharing.
I'm sure it's all very fascinating.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.196
Call my office
and we'll work something out.

34:33.273 --> 34:37.072
No, Leo. Leo. Wait, Leo. Wait a second.
All right, look...Look, Leo. Hey.

34:38.344 --> 34:41.574
Okay, look.
Leo, I'm not moving.

34:41.648 --> 34:45.550
You think I'm bluffing?
You're gonna have to run me down.

34:49.621 --> 34:52.250
Or back up.
One or the other.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.725
Adrian!

34:54.793 --> 34:57.490
Adrian?

34:57.564 --> 35:01.091
- Sharona.
- Ohh!

35:02.101 --> 35:04.865
Oh, my God. I've been looking
all over for you. Are you okay?

35:04.938 --> 35:09.341
Yeah, that was Leo Otterman.
I tried to stop him, but he got away.

35:09.409 --> 35:12.105
- I wanted to pay you. No, no, no.
- Just forget about that jerk.

35:12.178 --> 35:15.011
- Look at this.
- What have you been doing?

35:15.081 --> 35:18.141
Investigating. I went
to see Angie DeLuca.

35:18.218 --> 35:20.311
She used to date
Sidney Teal in college.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.581
Adrian, you're not
gonna believe this.

35:22.655 --> 35:26.216
There was another mugging 20 years ago.
It was the exact same thing...

35:26.292 --> 35:28.317
except Sidney Teal was
the guy being mugged.

35:28.394 --> 35:30.794
What?

35:30.864 --> 35:32.798
Now, get this.

35:32.866 --> 35:35.994
The mugger from 20 years ago
said, "Don't be a hero."

35:36.069 --> 35:38.060
Really?

35:39.639 --> 35:42.472
That's interesting. - See?

35:42.542 --> 35:45.409
I knew it was interesting.
I mean, I didn't know why,

35:45.478 --> 35:47.469
but I knew.

35:52.018 --> 35:54.009
I know that look.

35:55.021 --> 35:58.013
You got it, right?

35:59.058 --> 36:02.084
Are you sure about this?

36:02.161 --> 36:04.857
Yes. - You hesitated.
Why did you hesitate?

36:04.931 --> 36:07.456
I was thinking about something else.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.501
Mr. Modine. Thank you for coming.

36:09.569 --> 36:11.537
What the hell is
going on, Captain?

36:11.604 --> 36:13.317
Mr. Monk wants a few moments
of everybody's time.

36:13.352 --> 36:15.561
- I think that's not too much to ask.
- Capt. Stottlemeyer,

36:15.596 --> 36:17.901
- any leads on the Fraidy Cop?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:17.977 --> 36:19.034
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:19.069 --> 36:21.504
You want to ambush people,
you join the army, okay?

36:21.581 --> 36:24.129
The captain's trying to work here, people.
He doesn't have time for your crap

36:24.164 --> 36:25.745
Now, step back, please. Step back.

36:25.818 --> 36:28.810
- Well done, Officer Moratta.
- Thank you, sir.

36:34.494 --> 36:35.831
I wish I'd known you were coming.

36:35.866 --> 36:37.759
I could've had Mrs. Danvers
prepare something.

36:37.830 --> 36:39.764
This isn't a party, Mrs. Teal.

36:39.832 --> 36:41.925
I guess you can't believe
everything you read.

36:42.001 --> 36:44.697
Newspapers said
the investigation was closed.

36:44.771 --> 36:46.671
Theirs was. Ours wasn't.

36:46.739 --> 36:51.403
My attorney says that I can file a
harassment case whenever I feel like it.

36:51.477 --> 36:54.378
Mrs. Teal, your lawyers are gonna have
enough to do to keep you off of death row.

36:54.447 --> 36:56.677
You'll be needing
an attorney too, sir,

36:56.749 --> 37:00.412
for the murder of Sidney Teal
and the attempted murder of me.

37:00.486 --> 37:03.216
- The drive-by shooting.
- Both of them?

37:03.289 --> 37:05.612
They were in it together, Captain.

37:05.647 --> 37:07.851
I'll tell you what troubled me
from the very beginning...

37:07.927 --> 37:11.385
the knee pads and the elbow pads.

37:11.464 --> 37:13.762
When your husband
left that night,

37:13.833 --> 37:16.666
he wasn't planning
to mug anyone...

37:16.736 --> 37:18.761
and he wasn't planning
to kill anyone.

37:18.838 --> 37:21.568
He was just going out
to have a little fun.

37:21.641 --> 37:23.768
Maybe roll around
on the ground.

37:23.843 --> 37:27.370
He thought he was gonna help you
impress your date, Mr. Modine.

37:27.447 --> 37:30.575
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? You did it before 20 years ago.

37:30.650 --> 37:33.710
He wrote about it
in his book. Back in college,

37:33.786 --> 37:36.687
Sidney had a big date
with Angie DeLuca.

37:36.756 --> 37:40.453
He wasn't much of a ladies'man,
and he was trying to impress her.

37:40.526 --> 37:44.053
- So the two of you cooked up a plan.
- Yep, you cooked up a plan.

37:44.130 --> 37:46.758
Would you like to tell it?

37:46.833 --> 37:49.734
No, no, no, no. You're-You're-You're-You're
better at telling it.

37:49.802 --> 37:51.770
Yeah, but go ahead.
You can tell it.

37:51.838 --> 37:55.001
No. You tell it.
I'll tell it next time.

37:55.074 --> 37:58.942
- For God sakes, somebody tell it.
- It was a harmless little prank.

37:59.012 --> 38:03.142
You pretended to mug Sidney
Teal and his date. And for a minute...

38:03.216 --> 38:07.653
the mild-mannered computer geek
got to look like Superman.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.780
And I'm sure you both
had a big laugh about it later on.

38:10.857 --> 38:15.487
You are a nut case.
No one's gonna believe him.

38:15.561 --> 38:18.962
On occasion I've been known
to believe him. Don't stop now.

38:19.032 --> 38:21.262
- Where was I?
- Twenty years later,

38:21.334 --> 38:24.667
Sidney brought Myra
to his college fund-raiser,

38:24.737 --> 38:26.762
and that's where you two met.

38:26.839 --> 38:29.501
And you met again
and again and again.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.566
Are you sure
you don't want to tell it?

38:31.644 --> 38:33.680
No, no, no.
You're doing great. Just go.

38:33.715 --> 38:38.217
Ayear goes by.
You decide that life would be perfect...

38:38.284 --> 38:40.878
without Sidney Teal around.

38:40.953 --> 38:43.683
So you two hatch a plan.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.035
You contacted Sidney,

38:45.070 --> 38:48.784
and you reminded him of the time
you helped him impress his date,

38:48.861 --> 38:51.489
and you asked him ifhe wouldn't
like to return the favor.

38:51.564 --> 38:53.277
You knew he wouldn't say no.

38:53.312 --> 38:56.524
It was a chance for him to relive
one of the best nights ofhis life.

38:56.602 --> 38:58.866
And it worked like a charm.

38:58.938 --> 39:02.465
To the rest of the world, it appeared
that an eccentric billionaire...

39:02.542 --> 39:04.476
had a nervous breakdown.

39:04.544 --> 39:08.344
And if worse came to worse,
and anyone connected you with Sidney Teal,

39:08.414 --> 39:10.974
you just had to admit
that you'd had an affair...

39:11.050 --> 39:13.382
and claim that the shooting
was self-defense.

39:13.453 --> 39:16.422
That is one hell of a story, Mr. Monk,

39:16.489 --> 39:18.423
if you could prove it.

39:22.462 --> 39:24.550
He always went the extra mile.

39:24.585 --> 39:28.025
That night, your pal Sidney had
a little surprise of his own.

39:28.101 --> 39:30.467
- Really?
- Yes, sir. You see,

39:30.536 --> 39:34.529
he'd hired an actor
to pose as a cop.

39:34.607 --> 39:37.667
So after you scared off the mugger,

39:37.743 --> 39:41.839
the cop was going to run up
and commend you for your heroism.

39:41.914 --> 39:43.905
- Oh, my God.
- Fraidy Cop.

39:43.983 --> 39:47.749
I'm afraid so. You see, Captain,
I remembered what you'd said...

39:47.820 --> 39:51.779
that no cop in your department
would ever run from the scene of a crime.

39:51.858 --> 39:54.656
And it occurred to me,
maybe Fraidy Cop...

39:54.727 --> 39:56.752
wasn't a real cop.

39:56.829 --> 39:59.059
I checked all
the local costume shops.

39:59.132 --> 40:01.566
There was only one cop uniform
rented that night.

40:01.634 --> 40:03.761
Hey, what are you doin'?

40:09.675 --> 40:12.473
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meetJoseph Moratta.

40:12.545 --> 40:16.914
Very promising young actor. - You?

40:16.983 --> 40:20.111
Joe wanted me to mention that he can
be seen in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof...

40:20.186 --> 40:23.553
at the Harris Webley
Dinner Theater all next week.

40:23.623 --> 40:27.889
You know, when I heard the shots,
I guess I kind of panicked.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.485
I'm sorry if I caused
you guys any problems.

40:30.563 --> 40:33.054
Problems?
Kid, you have no idea!

40:33.132 --> 40:36.101
I swear, I didn't know
anything about this.

40:36.169 --> 40:38.137
This is all his idea.

40:38.204 --> 40:41.833
Lying bitch!

40:41.908 --> 40:43.773
Stay back! Stay back!
All of you!

40:45.845 --> 40:48.746
- Stay down! - Archie...
- Give me the arm!

40:50.049 --> 40:53.074
Modine, you're under arrest
for the murder of Sidney Teal.

40:53.109 --> 40:55.282
You have the right to remain silent.

40:55.354 --> 40:55.944
Anything you say, can be used
against you in a court oflaw.

40:55.979 --> 41:00.121
He's got a gun.! Look out.!

41:02.728 --> 41:05.595
Fraidy Cop, just
a couple of questions! Please!

41:09.202 --> 41:11.796
- Shoot him.
- I can't do that, sir.

41:11.871 --> 41:14.362
Then shoot me.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.626
1,400, 1,460.

41:18.703 --> 41:21.501
That's all I have.
You didn't have to call the cops.

41:21.573 --> 41:26.101
Here. - I... I prefer
not to handle cash.

41:26.177 --> 41:29.203
Nice doin' business
with you, Leo.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.147
Next time, sir,
just pay your debts.

41:32.217 --> 41:34.981
Wait a minute. I know you.
You were on the news.

41:35.053 --> 41:37.021
No, no, that was...
No, no! - Fraidy Cop.!

41:37.088 --> 41:39.022
Hey.! Come back here.!

41:39.090 --> 41:41.684
- Do you know who I am?
- Look at him go. He's an inspiration.

41:41.759 --> 41:44.250
- You cowards.!
- I was gonna give him a couple of bucks.

41:44.329 --> 41:46.559
Oh, you can send it to him.
He'll be in Canada by tomorrow.

41:46.631 --> 41:49.532
- Oh, God!
- I'll kill you!
