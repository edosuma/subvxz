- I told you I'd find you again,

- There's nothing for you here.

What exactly are you doing over

No. Actually, since wood nymphs

Well, what good will that do?
The Elders said the nymphs
were loose in the city.

12:39.999 --> 12:42.526

if we can find out
where they lived,

12:42.626 --> 12:44.899
you know, we can find out
what flushed them out

they're spirits of nature,
will be under green

- Nice try. Leo's got him.

You're not getting rid of me
that easy.

I am not trying to get rid of
you, all right.

I'm just trying to take point
because your life is so busy now

13:48.209 --> 13:50.776

I forgot there was
a staff meeting.

- No.

We're too busy fighting over
the best way to find nymphs.

Okay, well, stop arguing

- What's she saying?

Nobody knows who they are yet,
but believe me,

looking for them now.

- Downtown, City Plaza.

- Nymphs, Leo. Clearly nymphs.

about exposure.

16:29.918 --> 16:32.567
It's the way of nature.
The Eternal Spring we protect

renewed in the forest.

- So do you know
who the demon is?

No, only that he wanted us
to bring him
to the Eternal Spring

We can't imagine protecting
the forest without him.

38:31.459 --> 38:33.899
It's never been any other way.

38:33.999 --> 38:36.067
PAIGE:
Well, changes are good

38:36.167 --> 38:38.083
for all of us.

39:12.167 --> 39:13.983
PIPER:
He's so...

39:14.083 --> 39:15.899
...innocent.

39:15.999 --> 39:20.983
If he only had any idea
what Mommy and Auntie Paige
did today.

39:21.083 --> 39:24.275
They turned a very bad man
into a very big tree.

39:24.375 --> 39:25.834
Shh.

39:28.959 --> 39:31.899
He's gonna have enough problems
growing up around me as it is.

39:31.999 --> 39:35.234
Are you kidding me?
He is lucky to have you.

39:35.334 --> 39:37.899
Yeah, well, lucky or not,
he's got me.

39:37.999 --> 39:40.250
I so missed
not being around him today.

39:41.292 --> 39:42.900
- Hello?
- Shh.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.899
Sorry. You guys, I just wanted
to let you know

39:45.999 --> 39:48.776
that I'm going out.

39:48.876 --> 39:50.776
Trolling for satyrs, are we?

39:50.876 --> 39:53.150
No, I'm not trolling.

39:53.250 --> 39:55.899
I'm just gonna go out
with one of the guys
in the band.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.109
Oh, really?

39:57.209 --> 39:59.899
Don't you think he's gonna be
expecting the wild child?

39:59.999 --> 40:03.526
Never know, I might just have to
give him a little
somethin'-somethin'.

40:03.626 --> 40:07.234
Paige and I have decided to
share the responsibilities
of head witch

40:07.334 --> 40:09.899
so that I can spend more time
with Wyatt,

40:09.999 --> 40:12.250
- and she can...
- Rock on.

40:13.667 --> 40:15.692
Good night, you guys.

40:15.792 --> 40:18.651
- Right, rock on.
- Don't do that.

40:18.751 --> 40:19.983
- Rock on.
- Give it up, man.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.442
- What?
- Give it up.

40:21.542 --> 40:22.899
I'll show you give it up.

40:22.999 --> 40:25.584
You give it up is what I'm
saying. Right now!

40:33.209 --> 40:35.899
Your plant could use some water.

40:35.999 --> 40:37.792
I'll get right on that.

40:38.959 --> 40:42.150
I saw tomorrow's advance copy.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.275
I noticed that you're running
the article.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.651
Yes, I am.

40:45.751 --> 40:48.999
And I also noticed
that Paige's name wasn't in it.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.959
No, it isn't.

40:53.584 --> 40:54.792
Thank you.

40:56.667 --> 40:58.584
You know, it's ironic.

41:00.709 --> 41:03.942
You were the one who was worried
about sleeping with the boss,

41:04.042 --> 41:06.776
how it might affect your job.

41:06.876 --> 41:08.776
Turns out it affected mine.

41:08.876 --> 41:12.234
- How so?
- Well, I didn't buy this paper

41:12.334 --> 41:15.317
to bury stories like this one,
Phoebe.

41:15.417 --> 41:18.150
But that's basically
what I just did.

41:18.250 --> 41:21.484
I don't know what your sister's
involved in,

41:21.584 --> 41:23.667
but the truth is, I...

41:25.125 --> 41:27.417
I care about you too much
to cause you any hurt.

41:29.209 --> 41:32.734
- That's not very professional
of you.
- I know.

41:32.834 --> 41:35.667
- Maybe you should fire you.
- Maybe.

41:37.375 --> 41:42.067
I am still a little curious
about what you know of these
Godiva girls, though.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.484
Where they come from.

41:44.584 --> 41:46.709
What happened to them.

41:48.292 --> 41:50.042
You're not gonna tell me,
are you?

41:51.542 --> 41:53.459
I didn't think so.
