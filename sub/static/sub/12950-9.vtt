00:03.503 --> 00:05.604
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:05.605 --> 00:07.172
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.173 --> 00:10.609
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.380
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé,</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.782
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.955
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.556
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.557 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.169 --> 00:38.899
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.877
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.447 --> 00:49.648
Someone's having me followed.
Should I be worried?

00:49.649 --> 00:51.050
If Sloane suspects
a double agent,

00:51.051 --> 00:52.251
Dreyer is the one he'd turn to.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.519
The first thing Dreyer will do

00:53.520 --> 00:55.621
is give each of us
a functional imaging test.

00:55.622 --> 00:56.889
It's very difficult to deceive.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.723
Are you an agent of SD-6?

00:59.793 --> 01:01.560
Yes.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.495
Are you a double agent?

01:03.496 --> 01:05.364
No.

01:05.364 --> 01:07.865
I think we've found our mole.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.469
What is that?

01:10.470 --> 01:11.470
It's a star chart.

01:11.471 --> 01:14.963
A snapshot of the sky taken
from one specific place on Earth

01:15.075 --> 01:16.742
at one specific moment in time.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.179
The only spot on Earth with
that exact view of the stars

01:20.313 --> 01:22.907
is the southern slope
of Mt. Aconcagua

01:22.982 --> 01:25.217
on the Chile-Argentina border.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.718
Hey, I think we're almost
at our waypoint.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.623
I'm going in.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.564
Dixon, I've found it.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.299
It's Rambaldi's journal.
I found it.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.928
Sydney, they found us.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.873
What did you do to Dixon?

Dixon?
Dixon, do you copy?

03:08.087 --> 03:10.587
Dixon?

03:11.090 --> 03:13.590
Dixon, please...

03:45.892 --> 03:48.554
Dixon? Dixon!

03:48.628 --> 03:51.029
Oh, no, no.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.530
Oh, no, no, no.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.134
You weren't wearing
your vest! Why?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.404
Dixon?

03:59.405 --> 04:01.573
Syd...

04:01.574 --> 04:04.873
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay, Dixon.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.444
Just hang in.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.721
Take this with you.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.523
It's a satcom phone.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.625
It'll let you contact the CIA
from anywhere.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.127
And what happens when SD-6 sees

04:22.128 --> 04:24.263
I'm lugging around
a CIA-issue phone?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.031
Just don't let them see it.

04:26.032 --> 04:28.100
This thing's like a brick.
I can't take this.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.234
Take it.

04:29.235 --> 04:32.693
Worst-case scenario,
you might need it.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.137

Just hang in there.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.698
Just hang in there.
You just hang in there.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.212
Come on. Come on. Come on.

05:14.213 --> 05:17.410

I got you. Just hang in.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.657
Are you okay?

05:28.428 --> 05:30.928
I'm fine.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.228
So, what happened
when the chopper came?

05:37.203 --> 05:39.763
The CIA helicopter
airlifted us

05:39.872 --> 05:42.466
to a hospital in Buenos Aires.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.973
The whole flight,
I was thinking about Sloane.

05:47.046 --> 05:50.311
What he might do
when he found out.

05:50.383 --> 05:54.752
Learning that I was
betraying SD-6 this whole time.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.222
Then I thought of a way out.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.125
I called Sloane.

06:00.126 --> 06:03.493
Told him that I'd dragged
Dixon back to the Humvee.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.764
That I drove him
to the hospital myself.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.999
I couldn't tell
in his voice if he believed me,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.034
but I think he did.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.731
They airlifted us
back to Los Angeles.

06:12.839 --> 06:14.406
When we got here,

06:14.407 --> 06:16.775
they took us
to Angel of Mercy Hospital.

06:16.776 --> 06:19.276
- Good.
- No.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.214
It's an SD-6 hospital.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.049
3 gunshot wounds,
14 hours old.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.350
We've got internal bleeding.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.786
Agent Bristow, have you been
briefed on your cover story?

06:27.787 --> 06:28.787
Is he gonna be okay?

06:28.788 --> 06:30.322
Mrs. Dixon's waiting
to talk with you.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.391
Sloane wanted me to confirm
that you've been briefed.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.020
Yes, I know my cover story.
Is my partner gonna live?

06:35.094 --> 06:37.594
We don't know.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.899
Then I had to lie
to Dixon's wife.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.367
We were just standing there

06:42.368 --> 06:44.136
outside the bank's
office in Rome.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.637
This car pulled up.
I didn't even see it.

06:46.639 --> 06:49.665
These men stepped out.
They had guns.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.077
They wanted
the bank's computer codes.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.945
I had them in my briefcase.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.248
Your husband grabbed me,
pulled me to the ground.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.749
I heard gunshots.

06:58.951 --> 07:01.451
You should have seen him.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.389
I didn't even know
he'd been hit.

07:04.390 --> 07:09.794
You just never think
something like this...

07:09.862 --> 07:12.362
He's strong.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.332
He's gonna make it.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.134
He will make it?

07:16.135 --> 07:18.635
We don't know that.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.973
Dixon was bleeding so much.

07:21.974 --> 07:23.942
I was afraid if I took
my hand off his wound,

07:23.943 --> 07:26.537
he'd lose too much blood.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.048
So I used the satcom phone
right in front of him.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.050
You said
he was barely conscious.

07:32.051 --> 07:35.111
But he heard me.
He repeated my code name twice.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.122
I'd suggest that you put
operatives there

07:37.123 --> 07:39.887
just to be there
when he regains consciousness.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.459
But it's an SD-6 hospital.

07:46.165 --> 07:48.665
He will make it.

08:05.117 --> 08:08.416
You're in a very difficult
position, Mr. Dreyer.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.616
You've been sent to SD-6
to find a mole.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.592
The Alliance must be
pressuring you to deliver.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.261
I'm just doing my job.

08:16.262 --> 08:19.095
We both are.
We're both doing our job.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.299
I look at Sydney Bristow's
test results.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.602
I don't see a single spike.
She didn't falter once.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.370
She's guilty.
She's the one.

08:25.371 --> 08:27.138
I think that's
a dangerous accusation

08:27.139 --> 08:29.174
being made by a desperate man.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.309
I'm not desperate,
Mr. Sloane.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.445
But I am curious

08:33.446 --> 08:35.679
why you feel the need
to defend Miss Bristow.

08:35.681 --> 08:39.082
I don't.
I don't need to defend her.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.886
The results defend her.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.755
The results are too perfect.

08:44.824 --> 08:48.954
We all have our speciality.
This is mine.

08:49.028 --> 08:52.520
With all due respect, uh,
Mr. Sloane,

08:52.598 --> 08:54.199
you're ignoring the facts.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.964
Sidney Bristow has made
numerous mistakes,

08:57.036 --> 08:59.664
not the least of which
was her most recent mission.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.570
Her partner was almost killed.

09:02.642 --> 09:05.043
She could have retrieved
the Rambaldi book,

09:05.044 --> 09:07.544
which is now
in K-Directorate hands.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.840
Sydney Bristow is the mole.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.352
If you don't
follow protocol on this,

09:15.388 --> 09:17.722
I'm going to The Alliance.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.223
Dreyer...

09:20.826 --> 09:23.326
Don't you do a damn thing.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.565
I'll take care of Bristow.

10:04.403 --> 10:05.270
Is Dixon gonna be okay?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.865
He's still in ICU.
They don't know.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.704
So guys with guns
jumped out of a car?

10:10.776 --> 10:12.010
It was over so quickly.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.980
What for? For computer codes?
Bank stuff?

10:15.047 --> 10:17.048
Can you not be a reporter
for two minutes?

10:17.049 --> 10:19.284
I'm asking because I care.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.819
I just think it's weird

10:20.820 --> 10:23.380
for something else like this
to happen to you.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.556
First, it's Danny.
Now it's this.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.057
Leave her alone
or I will kick your ass.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.167
Thank God you're okay.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.745
Nobody move!

10:46.746 --> 10:50.147
Down on the floor!
Everyone, down!

10:50.216 --> 10:51.883
Down on the floor!

10:51.884 --> 10:54.384
Stay down!

10:54.787 --> 10:57.312
We've seen hundreds
of bank robberies.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.858
At first glance, there's
nothing out of the ordinary,

10:59.859 --> 11:02.359
but these men have
skills, materials.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.763
The robbery was a distraction.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.232
While those men were
accessing the registers,

11:07.233 --> 11:09.668
these two men hacked
into the bank's mainframe

11:09.669 --> 11:12.169
and rerouted funds.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.671
They work for Ineni Hassan.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.335
Why would Hassan be robbing
a bank in the States?

11:17.443 --> 11:19.411
Because that bank
controlled his assets

11:19.412 --> 11:21.413
recently frozen
by the U.S. Government.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.975
He used those men to transfer
his money so he could access it.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.320
We've put up with Hassan
for years,

11:29.321 --> 11:31.423
mostly because he provided us
with good intel.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.425
Now he's closing shop,
relocating.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.793
We don't know where.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.128
He's been missing
for two weeks.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.330
Hassan is too dangerous
to trust as a free agent.

11:39.331 --> 11:42.391
Now it's our job
to bring him to justice.

11:42.468 --> 11:43.735
Where did Hassan
reroute the money?

11:43.736 --> 11:45.303
That's what we need
to find out.

11:45.304 --> 11:48.637
If we don't steal back his
fortune, he could use that money

11:48.708 --> 11:50.842
to buy protection
in the Middle East.

11:50.843 --> 11:53.343
If he does that, he could
partner with a hostile country

11:53.345 --> 11:56.371
and provide them with all
the arms they will ever need.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.752
Logan Gerace.
He's an accountant.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.189
He has one client.
Ineni Hassan.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.224
Gerace's known for his parties
at his villa in Tuscany.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.955
Entertains dignitaries,
diplomats.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.462
He's having an event
on Friday night.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.229
You'll be there.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.465
While Dixon's in recovery,
you'll go it alone.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.066
We have no in to the party.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.102
You won't be
on the guest list.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.803
Shouldn't be a problem.

12:18.804 --> 12:21.106
Your mission is
to retrieve Hassan's

12:21.107 --> 12:23.940
offshore-account number
from Gerace's computer.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.509
Dead-drop the info
at Dinatti Park,

12:26.612 --> 12:28.446
which is five miles
from the party.

12:28.447 --> 12:29.714
When do I leave?

12:29.715 --> 12:31.316
Tonight.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.445
So this guy I know was killed.
Danny Hecht.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.250
Nicest guy in the world.
Killed in his bathroom.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.315
The police say there's no
motive, there was no suspect.

12:40.392 --> 12:41.793
Then I stumble upon this.

12:41.794 --> 12:44.354
There's a video blackout
the night that he was killed.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.030
- Weird.
- That's weird, right?

12:46.031 --> 12:46.865
There's more.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.167
There's a woman
named Kate Jones

12:49.168 --> 12:51.002
who was supposed to be
traveling with Danny

12:51.003 --> 12:52.437
to Singapore that night.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.464
So what do I do? I call around.
I find this woman.

12:55.574 --> 12:57.542
Winds up she's lying to me.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.944
Her real name is Eloise Kurtz.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.147
Somebody paid her
to talk to me.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.381
Weird.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.976
Thank you.
Yeah, well, it gets weirder.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.645
This woman that said that
she was Kate Jones...

13:08.721 --> 13:10.054
she's dead.

13:10.055 --> 13:12.323
Killed.

13:12.324 --> 13:13.358
Who killed her?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.226
I don't know.
That's why I'm here.

13:15.227 --> 13:18.094
Who killed Eloise Kurtz?
Who killed Daniel Hecht?

13:18.164 --> 13:20.758
And then somebody covers up
the passenger manifest.

13:20.833 --> 13:24.462
I think whoever did that
gave Eloise Kurtz that pin.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.070
- Here we go.
- What?

13:29.408 --> 13:31.908
Damn.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.514
This mama's gorgeous.

13:36.515 --> 13:39.075
Why?
Why is she so gorgeous?

13:39.151 --> 13:40.785
It's M.E.M.S.

13:40.786 --> 13:43.087
Micro-Electro-Mechanical
System technology.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.423
This is like
the next gen's next gen.

13:45.424 --> 13:47.625
What are you saying?
This is government issue?

13:47.626 --> 13:48.860
The guy at the science lab...

13:48.861 --> 13:50.395
Shh!

13:50.396 --> 13:52.896
- The guy...
- Shh!

13:54.700 --> 13:56.968
It's on.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.736
What do you mean? Right now?

13:58.737 --> 13:59.737
Yes.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.542
Who is it?

14:04.543 --> 14:07.043
I don't know.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.506
You should report your boss
to the corporate office.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.852
Making you go to Boston
after everything

14:13.853 --> 14:15.286
you just went through.

14:15.287 --> 14:16.921
You deserve a month off
with pay.

14:16.922 --> 14:19.257
What do you think
of this wedding dress?

14:19.258 --> 14:22.056
You can't go shopping for
a wedding dress in a magazine.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.095
Let's go to that boutique
on Beverly.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.792
I have always wanted
a reason to go there,

14:26.866 --> 14:28.433
and now I have a reason.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.501
Yeah.
You're getting married.

14:30.502 --> 14:33.528
I am.
I'm getting married.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.433
How about Saturday?

14:40.279 --> 14:41.079
Hello?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.780
Joey's pizza?

14:42.781 --> 14:44.582
Wrong number.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.018
- So Saturday?
- Yes.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.387
- Noon?
- For sure.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.789
SD-6 doesn't want
to bring Hassan to justice.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.258
They just want revenge.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.859
Revenge for what?

14:54.860 --> 14:57.360
Something you did.

14:57.529 --> 15:00.760
When Hassan bought
that nuclear weapon from SD-6

15:00.833 --> 15:02.934
and you snuck into Hassan's base
and stole the core back,

15:02.935 --> 15:04.836
he thought he was being
double-crossed,

15:04.837 --> 15:06.371
that only SD-6 would have known

15:06.372 --> 15:08.006
he had the bomb
and where it was.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.107
Oh, God.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.975
So last week, he sold SD-6

15:10.976 --> 15:13.278
10 stinger
anti-aircraft missiles.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.213
They want him to fortify
their base in Oman.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.581
Hassan had a good laugh.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.983
He took the money and ran.
Didn't deliver.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.818
So SD-6 wants to send out
a message

15:20.819 --> 15:22.654
to everyone else
they do business with.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.756
"Don't mess with SD-6."

15:24.757 --> 15:27.521
The CIA actually wants
to bring Hassan to justice.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.627
We want SD-6
to have that money.

15:29.628 --> 15:30.728
Why?

15:30.729 --> 15:32.263
That way,
we can tag the accounts

15:32.264 --> 15:34.432
and see where they take it,
what they spend it on.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.459
It'll give us a profile into
how SD-6 does their banking.

15:37.569 --> 15:40.069
Here. Take this.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.899
Attach it to the top
of the SD-6 retrieval device.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.344
It'll copy whatever you get
from Gerace's computer.

15:46.345 --> 15:48.713
Okay.

15:48.714 --> 15:51.214
Are you okay?

15:51.717 --> 15:53.918
I was getting briefed
by Marshall.

15:53.919 --> 15:56.854
Okay, now,
this thing sucks. Literally.

15:56.922 --> 15:59.023
Sucks all the information
from the computer hard drive

15:59.024 --> 16:00.391
right into
the internal flash ram.

16:00.392 --> 16:03.793
Now, just place it on or near
the computer hard drive

16:03.862 --> 16:06.763
and when this light is green,
it's reading.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.032
How long does it take?

16:08.033 --> 16:10.533
It should suck up to 40 gigs
in under 2 minutes.

16:10.569 --> 16:11.836
Do you want some candy?

16:11.837 --> 16:13.838
I just put this jar
of candy in here.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.007
I'm trying to make the place
a little more inviting.

16:16.008 --> 16:18.704
You want to take a seat
in the inflatable chair?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.480
Come see me when you're done.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.914
I should start
with your test results.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.388
You passed just fine.
The numbers were normal.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.324
I'd hope so.

16:34.393 --> 16:37.226
I know what a difficult time
this is.

16:37.296 --> 16:40.459
I understand.
Dixon in the hospital.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.000
Have you heard anything?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.334
He's still unconscious.
They're not sure how bad it is.

16:48.907 --> 16:51.407
Look, Sydney...

16:53.679 --> 16:55.713
I don't blame you

16:55.714 --> 16:58.214
for not talking to me
the way you used to.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.953
For hating me...

17:05.190 --> 17:08.751
...since what happened
with Danny.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.294
Please believe me
when I tell you

17:10.295 --> 17:12.262
it was the last thing I wanted.

17:12.263 --> 17:15.426
I begged security section
not to take that action.

17:15.501 --> 17:18.001
No, you didn't.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.105
You don't have to believe me.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.508
Why would you try and stop
what you had ordered?

17:23.509 --> 17:26.009
Because of you.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.437
I always knew
there was something about you.

17:29.515 --> 17:32.245
From the first time
I saw you.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.252
A lot can change in seven years.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.753
It's been a lot longer
than seven years.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.448
I've known your father
since 1971.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.927
I met him at Langley.
I knew your mother.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.396
I went to your parents' wedding.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.897
Sydney, I've known you
since you were a baby.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.433
I was out of the country
for most of your childhood.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.303
Various operations.

17:52.304 --> 17:53.671
But I kept tabs on you.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.172
I checked in in my own way.

17:57.876 --> 18:00.011
I always thought of you
as my daughter.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.810
Even from the beginning.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.314
Well, I just wanted to
let you know...

18:15.594 --> 18:18.094
...before you went away.

18:27.806 --> 18:31.071
It was almost like
he was saying goodbye.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.611
Like he knew
that I'm not coming back.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.112
You're gonna be okay.
We'll get through this.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.484
Just contact me
as soon as you get back.

18:39.485 --> 18:40.485
I know.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.854
With his account numbers.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.355
No, I mean with or without
the accounts.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.358
Just as soon as you get back.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.393
Okay.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.295
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.166
You wanted to see me?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.238
Sir?

19:00.239 --> 19:02.406
Yes.

19:02.407 --> 19:07.868
I need to send a communiqué
to SD-4 office in Rome.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.574
Attention Spinelli.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.419
Put it out through server 5.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.920
Yes, sir.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.424
I'm ordering...

19:20.425 --> 19:24.020
with security section
full knowledge...

19:24.096 --> 19:26.792
the assassination
of an SD-6 officer.

19:26.865 --> 19:30.767
Method: Close-range hit.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.572
This officer is scheduled
to make a dead drop

19:34.573 --> 19:37.073
at Dinatti Park,
10:00 p. m. Tomorrow.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.872
That's when the kill
should take place.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.379
Yes, sir.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.383
The target's name is Bristow.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.657
Sydney Bristow.

20:17.249 --> 20:20.844
<i># Tell me why
we're all gluttons for pain #</i>

20:20.919 --> 20:24.218
<i># The girl is totally insane #</i>

20:24.289 --> 20:27.520
<i># She doesn't know
the meaning of tame #</i>

20:27.593 --> 20:31.859
<i># Still, I can't
put out the flame #</i>

20:31.930 --> 20:37.732
<i># Hey, hey, I wanna play
on the team that you despise #</i>

20:37.836 --> 20:41.272
<i># Every day a new disguise #</i>

20:41.340 --> 20:44.400
<i># Every night a Halloween #</i>

20:44.509 --> 20:47.774
<i># She says
"Keep the motor runnin', man" #</i>

20:47.846 --> 20:50.974
<i># Like I was some machine #</i>

20:51.049 --> 20:52.817
<i># Are you tryin'
to talk, talk? #</i>

20:52.818 --> 20:54.986
<i># But I'm keepin' her stock #</i>

20:54.987 --> 20:56.821
Step one is to find Gerace

20:56.822 --> 20:58.155
and get ahold
of something he touched.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.690
Looks like a normal phone
that you'd call.

20:59.691 --> 21:02.159
"Hi, you want to go out
on Fri..."

21:02.160 --> 21:04.629
But...
"No? Okay, that's fine."

21:04.630 --> 21:07.258
But it's actually
a biometric sensor.

21:07.332 --> 21:10.529
Now, it lifts the print off
any smooth surface,

21:10.602 --> 21:14.038
digitizes it, and then creates
a liquid latex duplicate

21:14.106 --> 21:16.374
you can use
to get into Gerace's study.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.542
There's enough liquid latex
for one copy,

21:18.543 --> 21:21.478
so make sure you get
the right fingerprint.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.850
<i># On you like a hungry tick #</i>

21:27.919 --> 21:31.377
<i># Like a junkie
knows he oughta kick #</i>

21:31.456 --> 21:34.482
<i># But I don't wanna be
dope sick #</i>

21:34.559 --> 21:38.859
<i># So I scramble for a fix #</i>

21:38.930 --> 21:41.592
<i># Voodoo, sorcery too #</i>

21:41.667 --> 21:44.761
<i># I can't shake
your freaky spell #</i>

21:44.836 --> 21:45.903
<i># Why fight? #</i>

21:45.904 --> 21:48.205
<i># You've got me
roped and tied #</i>

21:49.408 --> 21:51.776
<i># I'm so diggin' your scene #</i>

21:51.777 --> 21:54.371
<i># I said
you're playin' with my head #</i>

21:54.446 --> 21:56.280
<i># I could split instead #</i>

21:56.281 --> 21:58.549
<i># I'm so diggin' your scene #</i>

21:58.550 --> 22:01.485
<i># Can anybody tell me
why we're Springer bound? #</i>

22:01.553 --> 22:04.078
<i># Why we feel so up
when we're kept down? #</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:07.824
Damn it.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.368
I don't know who you are...

22:17.369 --> 22:20.031
but Eloise Kurtz was wearing
this the day that she met me.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.834
I assume that you heard
at least that conversation,

22:22.941 --> 22:25.441
which means that you know
that I'm a reporter

22:25.544 --> 22:27.078
and I've been trying
to figure out what happened

22:27.079 --> 22:29.480
to Danny Hecht
and now to Eloise Kurtz.

22:29.481 --> 22:32.678
So if you killed her...

22:32.751 --> 22:35.251
then you would know
that I'm a threat to you,

22:35.287 --> 22:38.654
and you would've already
killed me, too.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.958
Unless you didn't kill her.

22:40.959 --> 22:43.860
In which case,
I need to talk to you.

22:43.929 --> 22:51.631
My cell number
is 310-555-0153.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.237
Please...

22:56.108 --> 22:58.608
Call me.

22:59.644 --> 23:02.977
Please.
I need to talk to you.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.221
Hello?

23:10.222 --> 23:12.022
Francie?

23:12.023 --> 23:13.924
Yeah, hi.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.425
No, I don't know
where she is.

23:16.428 --> 23:18.928
No, I don't think
she got back yet.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.581
Hey, Agent Bristow's
been made.

24:10.582 --> 24:13.278
We just unlocked this communiqué
off the SD-6 server.

24:13.351 --> 24:14.919
What?

24:14.920 --> 24:18.014
10:00 P.M., Dinatti Park.
They're gonna kill her.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.589
SD-6 is gonna kill her.

24:20.592 --> 24:24.050
I went to tell Davenport,
but he's not in his office.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.629
We need an extraction
team assembled in Italy.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.899
No, Tuscany now.
We only have two hours.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.901
- I'll go tell Davenport.
- He's not in his office.

24:30.902 --> 24:32.670
I'm gonna find him.
Get me Jack Bristow.

24:32.671 --> 24:33.871
Jack Bristow. Right.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.660
I don't speak Italian.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.630
But I love everything
about this house.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.199
Except the spinning.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.667
Can you do something
about the spinning?

25:03.668 --> 25:05.703
This floor is not for guests.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.832
Can you tell me
where the bathroom is?

25:11.309 --> 25:13.809
It's upstairs.
Watch your step.

25:15.413 --> 25:17.214
Yeah?

25:17.215 --> 25:18.549
I got your message.
I'm on a secure line.

25:18.550 --> 25:19.817
There's been a hit
put out on Sydney.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.652
I'm getting her out.

25:21.653 --> 25:23.687
Not yet.
You could be making a mistake.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.622
I don't think so.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.457
Do nothing
until you hear from me.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.658
We already have a team
en route.

25:32.430 --> 25:33.330
Ah! Yeah?

25:33.331 --> 25:35.766
I sent a communiqué to SD-4,
but they never received it.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.601
Oh, uh,
you want some candy?

25:37.602 --> 25:40.730
No. I need you to check
the server logs right away.

25:42.140 --> 25:46.167
Over here.
This, uh, here is a list

25:46.278 --> 25:48.778
of all outgoing messages
in the last 72 hours.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.148
- This includes every server?
- Yeah.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.117
Well, except server 5.

25:53.118 --> 25:54.952
Since security section
ran that drill,

25:54.953 --> 25:56.053
it's not connected
to the main network.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.621
Communiqué wouldn't go
that route.

25:57.622 --> 26:00.122
Let's look there anyway.

26:08.433 --> 26:10.668
Okay, team's in place
at Dinatti Park.

26:10.669 --> 26:13.331
I've got six armed officers
stationed and waiting.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.606
One by the fountain.
Two at the southern entrance.

26:15.607 --> 26:16.941
One at the western gate.

26:16.942 --> 26:19.310
Our snipers
are at the north end.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.844
Standing by
awaiting Bristow's arrival.

26:20.845 --> 26:22.313
First sighting,
I take her to safety.

26:22.314 --> 26:23.881
Are they still scanning
for gunmen?

26:23.882 --> 26:26.382
Yes, sir. Scan's complete.
No shooters have been 20'd.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.978
I've got three operatives
surrounding the park on lookout.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.758
Jack. You should...

26:34.759 --> 26:35.926
Take me to Field Ops.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.363
- Mr. Bristow.
- Call them off.

26:39.364 --> 26:40.631
Did you read
Sloane's transmission?

26:40.632 --> 26:41.966
She'll be
in the park any minute.

26:41.967 --> 26:44.268
No execution has been ordered.
This is a setup.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.369
What are you talking about?

26:45.370 --> 26:47.571
Sloane's transmission
was sent on SD-6 server 5.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.006
It was only sent out to you.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.507
Vaughn, they know
someone's listening.

26:51.509 --> 26:52.543
This is a test.

26:52.544 --> 26:53.477
We'll take that chance,

26:53.478 --> 26:55.713
get Sydney out of there,
and argue about this later.

26:55.714 --> 26:56.680
You go in like this...

26:56.681 --> 26:58.882
it'll only prove that you've
intercepted Sloane's communiqué,

26:58.883 --> 27:00.117
and Sydney will be exposed.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.119
You don't know that
for a fact.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.714
Why am I even talking to you?
Lloyd, abort this mission.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.824
- Hey, wait a minute!
- We verified this order, Jack.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.425
We pull back, you could be
killing your daughter.

27:08.426 --> 27:09.560
You're killing her
if you don't.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.462
How could you be willing
to risk something like this?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.564
If Sydney makes
her scheduled dead drop,

27:13.565 --> 27:14.565
and leaves the park,

27:14.566 --> 27:17.660
she will have proven herself
loyal to SD-6.

27:19.337 --> 27:20.804
Have them hold.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.873
No. Hold it.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.341
This is Sydney's life.

27:24.342 --> 27:25.709
You were meant to see
that transmission.

27:25.710 --> 27:26.944
You're the only ones
who saw it.

27:26.945 --> 27:29.213
Someone is going to kill her
if we don't do anything.

27:29.214 --> 27:31.714
I know how Sloane works.
He's bluffing.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.157
Alpha 2, come in.

27:42.427 --> 27:45.260
Bristow's entering the park.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.830
We have two vehicles here
that are not on list.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.071
Red jacket.

27:54.072 --> 27:56.340
Who's this guy
in the jacket?

27:56.341 --> 27:58.841
Copy that.

27:59.711 --> 28:03.238
Position 3, we have
an approaching hostile.

28:04.315 --> 28:07.079
Acquire male target.
75 meters.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.627
This could be our guy.
What are we doing here?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.564
Jack, promise me
you're not wrong about this.

28:20.565 --> 28:23.065
Hold your position.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.507
He could be going for a gun.

28:30.508 --> 28:32.176
Prepare to take him out.

28:32.177 --> 28:34.677
Stand by.

28:46.958 --> 28:49.458
Copy that.

28:51.629 --> 28:54.129
That's her dead drop.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.664
Okay. She's out of the park.
She's clear.

29:02.874 --> 29:05.374
Good work, Jack.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.081
Oy.
I just lost 30 pounds.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.550
Okay? I'm not kidding.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.753
Oh, God.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.985
This is exactly
why I became a reporter.

29:19.057 --> 29:21.358
It's like
the best movie ever made.

29:21.359 --> 29:22.559
"His Girl Friday"?

29:22.560 --> 29:23.761
Yeah.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.062
What's a better movie
than that?

29:25.063 --> 29:26.897
"Godfather,"
"On the Waterfront"...

29:26.898 --> 29:28.565
- "Citizen Kane"...
- Okay, you're right.

29:28.566 --> 29:30.534
"Raging Bull,"
"Empire Strikes Back."

29:30.535 --> 29:33.265
Okay, whatever.
It sucks, all right?

29:33.371 --> 29:35.472
But it's why
I wanted to become a reporter.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.841
I saw this when I was a kid,
and I loved it.

29:37.842 --> 29:40.342
I was just, I don't know,
all the quick...

29:40.445 --> 29:41.779
- Repartee?
- Yeah.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.313
It looked fun, you know?

29:43.314 --> 29:45.149
Being a reporter looked fun.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.817
But it's not fun.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.318
It's a pain in the ass.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.819
What's your problem?

29:51.022 --> 29:53.522
Will?

29:57.228 --> 29:59.728
What are you doing?

30:00.598 --> 30:02.099
Will?

30:02.100 --> 30:04.600
Scoot over.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.508
Is something even in there?

30:13.344 --> 30:15.078
Oh, it's so ugly.

30:15.079 --> 30:17.214
It's a bug.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.315
It's a microphone.

30:18.316 --> 30:21.046
- No, it's not.
- It's a story I'm working on.

30:21.119 --> 30:24.577
I'm living in a puzzle.
I can't figure anything out.

30:24.656 --> 30:28.592
I don't know who's doing what.
I'm a mess.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.427
You're looking at a mess.

30:30.428 --> 30:33.625
And whosever listening
can go to hell!

30:34.232 --> 30:34.998
Hear that?

30:34.999 --> 30:37.367
Do you really think
somebody's listening?

30:37.368 --> 30:38.802
Yeah,
I don't even care anymore.

30:38.803 --> 30:41.138
I just want to watch old movies
and go to sleep.

30:41.139 --> 30:43.903
Do you think I will find
a good wedding dress?

30:43.975 --> 30:46.076
Fran, it's not a Magic 8 Ball.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.644
Hello?

30:47.645 --> 30:49.780
Yeah. Tell them
to stop torturing me.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.982
Stop torturing Will Tippin.

30:51.983 --> 30:55.510
He's my friend.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.087
Bad people.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.590
Hello?

30:59.591 --> 31:01.692
Stop talking about the bug.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.662
Tell the person you're with
this is a wrong number.

31:04.729 --> 31:07.562
Hello?

31:09.367 --> 31:11.867
Who was that?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.238
It was a wrong number.

31:18.142 --> 31:21.134
You sent the communiqué
on server 5.

31:21.246 --> 31:25.046
High-level intel could deduce
that your directive was bogus.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.284
Whoever's hacked
into our computer network

31:27.285 --> 31:29.486
has no reason to believe
we're setting them up.

31:29.487 --> 31:31.987
The point is,
they received the intel.

31:32.056 --> 31:35.082
If Bristow had been their agent,
they would have prevented her

31:35.159 --> 31:37.427
from going into the park
last night.

31:37.428 --> 31:39.263
Let's say
she had been the mole.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.998
So you're convinced she's not.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.499
Well, whether she is or not,

31:43.534 --> 31:46.034
if your plan had worked,

31:46.037 --> 31:49.029
if she had been revealed
as a mole,

31:49.140 --> 31:51.870
she would have been saved
by her people.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.311
And you...

31:54.312 --> 31:56.812
would have effectively...

31:56.881 --> 31:58.115
let her go.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.914
You have your answer
regarding Sydney Bristow.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.485
What are you protecting?

32:03.688 --> 32:05.689
Mr. Dreyer...

32:05.690 --> 32:09.057
I still believe we have
a situation here at SD-6.

32:09.127 --> 32:12.392
I strongly suggest
you keep looking for the mole

32:12.463 --> 32:17.366
and stop questioning
every decision I make.

32:21.072 --> 32:24.303
<i># I hear what you're saying #</i>

32:26.544 --> 32:30.310
<i># I'm listening now
to all the words #</i>

32:36.788 --> 32:38.021
Syd?

32:38.022 --> 32:39.222
Oh, Fran.

32:39.223 --> 32:40.390
Hey, when'd you get back?

32:40.391 --> 32:41.892
Oh, my God.
Your wedding dress.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.060
Oh, don't worry about it.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.395
- I am so sorry.
- How was Boston?

32:45.396 --> 32:47.364
- Did you get my message?
- I did.

32:47.365 --> 32:48.799
It's okay, seriously.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.968
It was probably
insensitive of me

32:50.969 --> 32:53.270
to ask you
to go wedding-dress shopping.

32:53.271 --> 32:56.138
- Why?
- Well, because...

32:56.207 --> 32:58.707
You were supposed to be
going through this.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.211
And I understand.

33:01.212 --> 33:05.444
And if you feel weird,
I'll do whatever you need.

33:05.516 --> 33:08.016
It's okay.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.492
Francie.

33:16.961 --> 33:19.486
This wasn't
about me losing Danny.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.131
This wasn't about me at all.

33:21.132 --> 33:24.795
The only reason I didn't
show up was because of work.

33:24.869 --> 33:27.337
I promise.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.406
Let's go next week, okay?

33:29.407 --> 33:31.907
Okay.

33:32.410 --> 33:35.573
Hey, any news about Dixon?
Is he okay?

33:35.646 --> 33:37.381
He still hasn't woken up.

33:37.382 --> 33:39.882
I'm really sorry.

33:44.422 --> 33:45.822
Hello?

33:45.823 --> 33:48.323
Hello, Will Tippin.

33:49.627 --> 33:50.827
Who is this?

33:50.828 --> 33:53.592
Go to 7 th and Spring.

33:53.664 --> 33:55.832
Analysis has reviewed
the information

33:55.833 --> 33:57.868
that you obtained
from Gerace's computer.

33:57.869 --> 34:01.600
Apparently, Hassan is more
paranoid than we predicted.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.840
His bank-account info
wasn't there?

34:03.841 --> 34:05.075
Yes and no.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.477
We know the bank,
but not the account numbers.

34:07.478 --> 34:10.174
Those numbers, according to
the files on the hard drive,

34:10.248 --> 34:11.514
are not stored in any computer,

34:11.516 --> 34:13.417
because a computer
can be hacked.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.012
If they're not in a computer,
where are the numbers?

34:16.087 --> 34:18.885
A safety-deposit box
in this bank.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.291
Omnicor, Incorporated.
Geneva, Switzerland.

34:21.292 --> 34:22.359
You're going in with Russek.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.228
You'll be Christiana Stevens.
You represent Dreiberg Diamonds.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.958
You're looking for a bank
to recommend to your clients

34:29.033 --> 34:30.333
for high-volume storage.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.833
You leave tonight.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.562
Great job in Tuscany.

34:43.214 --> 34:44.581
So it was a trap.

34:44.581 --> 34:45.614
Yes, it was.

34:45.616 --> 34:46.716
If you had pulled me out,

34:46.717 --> 34:48.452
Sloane would have known
I was the mole.

34:48.453 --> 34:52.389
But I would have been safe.
He gave me an out.

34:52.456 --> 34:53.924
He considers you a daughter.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.891
Don't remind me.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.393
How did you know
not to step in?

34:59.797 --> 35:01.364
It was your dad.

35:01.365 --> 35:04.892
He figured the truth.
That Sloane was setting us up.

35:04.969 --> 35:06.403
Hmm.

35:06.404 --> 35:07.337
What?

35:07.338 --> 35:09.473
It's gonna take forever
to bring them down.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.842
Well, this might help a little.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.643
- What is it?
- The new transmitter.

35:13.644 --> 35:14.945
We'll be able to hear
everything you're saying

35:14.946 --> 35:16.513
when you're in Switzerland.

35:16.514 --> 35:17.914
When you open
the safety-deposit boxes,

35:17.915 --> 35:20.050
read Hassan's
bank-account numbers aloud.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.918
SD-6 will get the numbers
at the same time.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.920
We'll tag the accounts
right there

35:23.921 --> 35:26.481
and track every move
SD-6 makes with that money.

35:27.925 --> 35:30.519
I know it's not exactly
a crushing blow, but...

35:30.595 --> 35:33.095
Every bit helps.

35:43.374 --> 35:44.741
Yes? Hello?

35:44.742 --> 35:46.409
Tell me you weren't followed.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.812
No, not a chance.
Come on, man. Who is this?

35:48.813 --> 35:51.941
You have questions
about Kate Jones.

35:52.016 --> 35:55.042
How far are you willing
to go, Mr. Tippin?

35:55.119 --> 35:57.849
I need to hear the words
"I'm ready."

35:57.922 --> 36:01.449
Why? Why?
Could my life be in danger?

36:01.526 --> 36:04.026
Say the words.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.829
Yeah, I'm in.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.767
I'm ready.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.163
Excuse me.

36:40.164 --> 36:43.156
Can you tell me where
Mr. Franco is, please?

36:43.234 --> 36:45.734
Could you wait here
a moment, please?

36:58.649 --> 36:59.816
Mr. Franco.

36:59.817 --> 37:02.152
Christiana Stevens,
Dreiberg Diamonds.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.054
I have an appointment
to tour the facility.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.717
Now, our security system
is powered

37:06.791 --> 37:09.125
by an on-site
underground generator,

37:09.126 --> 37:11.228
which means
that we are unaffected

37:11.229 --> 37:13.729
by the city blackouts.

37:17.268 --> 37:19.768
How high
is your insurance coverage?

37:19.804 --> 37:22.304
We have no preset limit,
although obviously,

37:22.306 --> 37:25.070
if your clients wish to store
their diamonds here,

37:25.142 --> 37:27.177
we would have
an independent appraiser

37:27.178 --> 37:29.613
value the merchandise.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.381
How has the current
political climate

37:31.382 --> 37:33.283
affected your privacy laws?

37:33.284 --> 37:35.784
Our first duty
is always to the customer,

37:35.820 --> 37:38.320
that we...

37:46.831 --> 37:48.665
Okay, Russek, I'm in.

37:48.666 --> 37:53.262
Remember,
Gerace's box is 22364.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.138
I'm accessing
the bank's on-line server.

37:55.139 --> 37:57.107
I'll stay on station.
Wait for your relay.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.408
Got it.

38:25.102 --> 38:26.636
Russek, I got it.
Are you ready?

38:26.637 --> 38:27.203
Go.

38:27.204 --> 38:32.733
Delta 6135,
Charlie 7 echo.

38:34.011 --> 38:35.111
That's it.

38:35.112 --> 38:37.637
Okay. Get this to our guys
in Treasury.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.249
I don't want to lose track
of a single penny.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.184
No kidding.

38:41.185 --> 38:43.685
Okay, money's transferred.

38:57.868 --> 38:59.202
You out of there yet,
Sydney?

39:00.171 --> 39:02.696
Not just yet.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.572
Help. He just fainted.
I'll call an ambulance.

39:59.063 --> 40:02.260
Hey. What are you doing?

40:02.333 --> 40:04.267
What did you tell
that reporter?

40:04.268 --> 40:06.703
I told him exactly what
I was supposed to tell him.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.104
Did you mention...

40:08.105 --> 40:09.239
Of course not.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.774
Did you tell him about...

40:22.686 --> 40:25.088
It's an anomaly, sir.

40:25.089 --> 40:28.252
While Sydney was in the bank
vault, there was definitely

40:28.325 --> 40:30.727
an additional transmission
out of Geneva.

40:30.728 --> 40:33.228
Not one of ours.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.722
I picked it up
in Signals Intelligence.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.334
It's just...

40:38.335 --> 40:41.964
You wanted me to tell you
if there was anything unusual.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.640
I didn't just get someone
in trouble, did I?

41:13.604 --> 41:14.671
Hello?

41:14.672 --> 41:17.641
Sydney, it's Diane.

41:17.708 --> 41:20.208
He's woken up.

41:51.775 --> 41:53.309
It's okay.

41:53.310 --> 41:54.878
Go on in.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.406
- I'm going to get some coffee.
- Okay, thanks.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.514
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:07.591 --> 42:09.325
It's so good to see you.

42:09.326 --> 42:11.826
You too.

42:21.071 --> 42:23.571
Dixon...

42:26.210 --> 42:30.670
Do you remember
what happened?

42:34.952 --> 42:37.978
The last thing I remember...

42:39.857 --> 42:42.292
was walking out...

42:42.293 --> 42:44.793
and trying to link
to the satellite.

42:47.998 --> 42:50.831
And that sweet smile of yours.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.670
Yep, and there it is.

44:13.350 --> 44:15.084
Yeah?

44:15.085 --> 44:16.819
We got her.

44:17.305 --> 44:23.220
