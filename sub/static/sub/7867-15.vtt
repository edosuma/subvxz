01:44.183 --> 01:49.751
And so, in summary, there are
only two real commandments,

01:49.871 --> 01:52.620
and the other eight are just filler.

01:52.961 --> 01:53.760
I knew it.

01:54.170 --> 01:56.773
And now, I have some exciting news.

01:56.893 --> 01:58.772
Tomorrow will be blessed with a visit

01:58.807 --> 02:02.818
from the highest ranking clergyman
of our Presbylutheran faith,

02:02.938 --> 02:05.212
his holiness, the parson.

02:06.478 --> 02:08.239
The parson? He's coming here?

02:10.142 --> 02:13.467
Oh, my God! She fainted!
Let's go get smelling salts!

02:16.080 --> 02:16.929
Suckers!

02:19.022 --> 02:21.127
Springfielders have
camped out all night

02:21.162 --> 02:24.006
to get a glimpse of the most
saintly person to visit our town

02:24.126 --> 02:27.497
since Mother Teresa
stopped here to gas up her Vespa.

02:27.532 --> 02:30.459
And I'm selling all sorts of
faith-based knick-knacks.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.324
Let's take a look.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.541
"I'd commit arson for the parson."

02:34.661 --> 02:36.460
"Clergymen can kiss my apse."

02:36.580 --> 02:37.830
All kinds of gems.

02:38.230 --> 02:40.341
Surprisingly, none of them have sold.

02:40.376 --> 02:41.436
Except for this one.

02:42.477 --> 02:45.791
There you have it.
News has never been softer.

02:45.911 --> 02:48.917
What's that? The parson is here!

02:50.881 --> 02:53.312
Oh, my God! It's him!
The earthly embodiment

02:53.432 --> 02:56.226
of the elected chair of
the national congress of deacons.

02:59.212 --> 03:03.706
Hello, everybody. I hope you didn't
go to all this trouble for little old me.

03:03.826 --> 03:06.955
Parson, Parson. Give us a quick
official church position on family?

03:07.075 --> 03:11.445
Well, in these modern times,
family is more important than ever.

03:12.129 --> 03:13.796
You just made my mustache tingle.

03:14.984 --> 03:16.449
Settle. Settle down.

03:16.731 --> 03:22.169
Now, now. I'm just a man like
any other that has been chosen by God.

03:22.415 --> 03:27.094
I have come here from our world spiritual
headquarters in Michigan City, Indiana

03:27.129 --> 03:30.045
to say, "Keep up the good work."

03:31.531 --> 03:35.459
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll do a little speaking with your deacon.

03:37.044 --> 03:39.927
<i>I love to go to church
It's where I like to read</i>

03:40.047 --> 03:44.662
<i>I get a day in of praying
And still tee off by three</i>

03:47.076 --> 03:50.883
Oh, calm down, Tim. He's just your
old roommate from Texas Christian.

03:51.003 --> 03:52.586
He's like the pope of this thing!

03:52.706 --> 03:56.316
This would be like Mary Kay visiting you
when you were selling her cosmetics.

03:56.436 --> 03:58.901
That is if you had stuck with it.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.670
You asked me to quit, because
I was making more than you.

04:01.790 --> 04:02.671
Not now. He's here.

04:03.946 --> 04:05.776
Welcome, Your Holiness.

04:05.896 --> 04:07.701
You'll love what
we've done with the church.

04:07.821 --> 04:10.271
There's fresh wax on all the pews.

04:10.733 --> 04:13.955
Sounds to me like somebody
put on more than just one coat.

04:14.193 --> 04:14.960
Maybe.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.214
Tim, is there somewhere
that we can talk?

04:17.334 --> 04:19.127
Of course. My office.

04:19.247 --> 04:19.874
Perfect.

04:20.108 --> 04:23.273
<i>Walking to your office
is what I like to do</i>

04:23.393 --> 04:27.186
<i>Maybe while we're at it
We'll peek in at your pews</i>

04:28.592 --> 04:29.524
Nilla wafer?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.748
I'll take two if you don't mind.

04:31.868 --> 04:35.773
Tim, I'm here because of a problem
with your last recertification.

04:35.893 --> 04:38.802
When we tried to charge
the filing fee to your credit card,

04:38.922 --> 04:39.976
it was declined.

04:40.096 --> 04:43.210
Oh, yeah. The bank put
on a security hold

04:43.330 --> 04:46.400
after they saw charge
from an offshore poker club.

04:46.634 --> 04:50.236
Helen had bought a fireplace poker
from Nova Scotia.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.047
She says it shifts logs better
than American pokers.

04:53.082 --> 04:56.852
But I disagree. We'll get through it.
We always do.

04:56.972 --> 04:59.032
Well, love conquers all, huh?

05:00.252 --> 05:02.378
I remember when
she was Helen Schwarzbaum.

05:02.659 --> 05:05.790
In fact, I remember when
she was Harold Schwarzbaum.

05:05.910 --> 05:06.478
You what?

05:06.513 --> 05:07.531
I've said too much.

05:07.566 --> 05:10.147
But for the three months
it took your card to go through,

05:10.267 --> 05:11.626
you weren't certified.

05:11.746 --> 05:14.068
Anything you officiated
during that time--

05:14.188 --> 05:16.579
funerals, baptisms, even bingo.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.163
Well it just didn't count.

05:18.863 --> 05:22.510
Well, I'm sure
the Lord is understanding.

05:22.545 --> 05:23.340
No, He's not.

05:24.206 --> 05:26.117
I'll notify those affected right away.

05:31.371 --> 05:32.498
Tea time.

05:33.626 --> 05:34.764
What's going on?

05:35.011 --> 05:38.087
Helen, I was briefly uncertified.

05:38.357 --> 05:40.966
So all those graces
you said were a lie?

05:41.086 --> 05:45.263
That food might as well have been
regurgitated by Satan himself.

05:45.499 --> 05:48.752
<i>Regurgitated by Satan
He couldn't keep it down</i>

05:48.787 --> 05:51.408
<i>Oh, 666
He got sick, sick, sick</i>

05:51.443 --> 05:54.436
<i>And that's how volcanoes were born</i>

05:57.118 --> 06:01.320
Due to a bureaucratic snafu,
I wasn't an official minister

06:01.440 --> 06:03.988
when we laid your dear Estelle to rest.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.228
She still alive?

06:06.348 --> 06:07.863
I'm afraid not.

06:08.611 --> 06:10.596
'Cos I left her ashes on the bus.

06:14.024 --> 06:17.696
So Captain, when I blessed
your vessel, it didn't count.

06:18.494 --> 06:19.610
Maybe the next one!

06:24.400 --> 06:29.031
So I'm afraid I wasn't the minister
when I blessed your ten-roof shanty.

06:29.151 --> 06:32.756
So that's why that ghost
keeps coming through the window.

06:32.791 --> 06:33.502
Afternoon.

06:33.537 --> 06:38.053
Fly away ghosty! Go back
to your haunted cornfield!

06:39.846 --> 06:42.298
Reverend Lovejoy, you deliver pizza now?

06:42.418 --> 06:46.034
We didn't order a pizza.
But you forgot the pizza anyway.

06:46.269 --> 06:49.017
Marge, the pizza place screwed up again.

06:49.288 --> 06:53.724
You remember when I remarried
you two after Homer got that divorce?

06:53.759 --> 06:55.648
Like it was yesterday.

07:00.730 --> 07:03.240
Kirk and Luann split up so Homer,

07:03.360 --> 07:04.731
fearing we would do the same,

07:04.851 --> 07:06.911
preemptively filed for divorce.

07:07.031 --> 07:11.264
But then you remarried us,
and we were as solid as ever.

07:11.545 --> 07:13.835
And I think Apu
got lucky with my sister.

07:15.775 --> 07:17.931
Well, I'm afraid that joyous occasion

07:18.148 --> 07:21.095
fell during a time when
I wasn't actually a minister.

07:21.679 --> 07:25.515
Since that time,
you two have not been legally wed.

07:25.918 --> 07:30.197
You don't get it, Paudre. My old lady
and I have a thing going on.

07:30.317 --> 07:33.016
We don't need
a piece of paper to keep it real.

07:33.136 --> 07:34.681
Who are you calling an old lady?

07:34.716 --> 07:35.861
I need that paper quick!

07:40.510 --> 07:43.221
So you and Mom aren't married?
Does that mean I'm a bastard?

07:43.341 --> 07:46.327
You were born while
they were married so legally, no.

07:46.447 --> 07:49.697
But in the sense someone calls you
one when they're angry, yes.

07:49.817 --> 07:53.853
It's not a big deal. We'll just go
to City Hall, and get married there.

07:54.099 --> 07:59.698
I think it's romantic. You can pretend
you're newlyweds starting a life together.

07:59.818 --> 08:02.328
Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies
running down the clock.

08:02.564 --> 08:03.891
Why, you little bastard!

08:04.897 --> 08:06.212
That's the angry one.

08:16.331 --> 08:19.324
This isn't the most
romantic place to get married.

08:19.359 --> 08:23.887
Sweetie, any place I'm marrying you
is the most romantic place in the world.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.345
Watch your back.
Half a corpse coming through.

08:30.754 --> 08:33.082
Marge, this time I'm gonna
give you the wedding deserve.

08:33.202 --> 08:34.100
Let's get out of here.

08:35.227 --> 08:36.638
That's the line to get out.

08:48.180 --> 08:48.799
Hello?

08:48.919 --> 08:52.322
Hello. It's me, Lance Romance.

08:52.442 --> 08:55.894
Your first mission
is to look out the window.

08:56.879 --> 08:59.111
Whatever you say, Lance.

09:09.796 --> 09:13.161
<i>This is Bill and Marty saying,
"Marge, go down to the basement."</i>

09:19.857 --> 09:21.794
Homer, what's going on?

09:21.914 --> 09:25.264
The violin, pants with a crease. Why?

09:25.981 --> 09:30.100
Marge, you deserve a wedding day
that, unlike our children,

09:30.220 --> 09:31.515
was planned in advance.

09:31.763 --> 09:35.781
So, will you marry me in style?

09:35.901 --> 09:38.774
Oh, yes, Homer. Yes.

09:38.894 --> 09:42.242
Did you hear that Santa?
She said, yes! Yes!

09:43.387 --> 09:46.063
Now back to your cold airless tomb.

09:46.346 --> 09:48.342
Ho, ho, ho.

09:54.478 --> 09:57.887
It's beautiful.
But that's an awful lot to pay

09:58.007 --> 09:59.745
for a dress I'll only wear once.

09:59.865 --> 10:03.960
Marge, a woman only gets
one chance at a second remarriage.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.825
The choice is yours.
You can look like a fairy princess,

10:06.945 --> 10:08.884
or a pig wrapped in rags.

10:09.896 --> 10:10.774
A princess?

10:10.894 --> 10:12.561
Fine. We'll do it your way.

10:12.914 --> 10:14.355
This one's a little gay, isn't it?

10:14.475 --> 10:17.830
Well, the last time I checked,
pirates weren't gay.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.336
Dude, how'd you check?

10:20.969 --> 10:23.655
Check out this
rocket ship cake, Marge.

10:23.775 --> 10:27.022
That's for a child's birthday.
We're going to get this one.

10:27.142 --> 10:29.750
Maybe we can bury
the rocket ship inside the cake.

10:29.785 --> 10:30.975
And that would be a big surprise,

10:31.095 --> 10:32.714
because I'd forget about it
pretty quick.

10:32.834 --> 10:36.318
No rockets!
You can pick the frosting.

10:36.438 --> 10:36.840
Chocolate!

10:36.960 --> 10:37.944
We'll take lemon.

10:39.958 --> 10:42.490
Okay, I want white roses at the alter,

10:42.525 --> 10:46.783
red roses along the aisle,
and blue roses in the centerpieces.

10:46.903 --> 10:48.155
There are no blue roses.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.851
I want to talk to Howard!

10:49.971 --> 10:51.466
Howard died ten years ago.

10:51.586 --> 10:53.926
Well did he take all
the blue roses with him?

10:54.046 --> 10:55.520
My father was a lovely man.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.370
He took very good care of my mother and me.

10:59.457 --> 11:03.511
All right, people. I want every table
to have two baskets of bread,

11:03.631 --> 11:05.114
but only one plate of butter.

11:05.234 --> 11:06.698
That'll stimulate conversation.

11:06.818 --> 11:07.292
What if we--

11:07.327 --> 11:09.254
There is no "we" in "wedding."

11:09.289 --> 11:11.429
But there is, Marge.
The first two letters.

11:11.464 --> 11:14.657
I can't believe you're ruining
the second Thursday before the wedding!

11:16.391 --> 11:17.682
Oh, Homer.

11:19.749 --> 11:22.909
I can't believe you told Lenny
and Carl they could bring dates!

11:23.029 --> 11:24.870
'Cos they're not even
coming to the wedding.

11:24.990 --> 11:25.451
Why not?

11:25.571 --> 11:30.373
Because they're RSVP cards arrived
one day after the deadline!

11:30.493 --> 11:34.040
Marge, maybe you should
take a break from wedding planning.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.400
I think you're becoming Bridezilla!

11:36.520 --> 11:37.868
Bridezilla?

11:38.631 --> 11:42.722
A combination of bride and Godzilla?

11:42.842 --> 11:43.943
How could you say that?

11:44.063 --> 11:46.376
More like you're a King Wrong!

12:12.389 --> 12:14.503
No matter what I do, Marge yells at me.

12:14.623 --> 12:18.296
If she's like this now, what will she
be like after we get married?

12:21.337 --> 12:23.596
Okay, okay. Everyone, back off!

12:23.716 --> 12:25.648
I want to see myself.

12:27.318 --> 12:30.817
A pimple? Not on my day, you don't.

12:33.623 --> 12:35.325
Okay, it's go time.

12:35.809 --> 12:36.784
Dim the lights.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.909
To the band.

12:41.686 --> 12:44.045
And release the groom.

12:46.277 --> 12:47.682
Homer, that's you.

12:49.689 --> 12:52.449
We are now eleven seconds
behind schedule!

12:56.164 --> 12:57.520
Homie!

13:17.567 --> 13:20.929
I can't believe Homer
left me at the alter.

13:20.964 --> 13:23.341
Oh, Marge. Have a shrimp puff.

13:23.376 --> 13:25.619
Wipe your tears with
the monogram napkins.

13:27.351 --> 13:31.686
I know it is hard, but smile for
the cameraman from Gary's Magic Moments.

13:31.806 --> 13:34.310
You have my deepest sympathy.

13:37.527 --> 13:39.805
What's going on?
What's with all the darkness?

13:40.345 --> 13:43.491
Hello? Marge? Where am I?

13:47.656 --> 13:50.676
What the-- I'm chained up
like a common bicycle!

13:51.918 --> 13:58.410
Who would do this to me? It would have
to be someone who could afford a chain.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.738
<i>You're going to be here a while.</i>

14:01.023 --> 14:02.284
But I have to marry Marge!

14:02.404 --> 14:05.507
<i>As of now, your pathetic
little life means nothing!</i>

14:05.627 --> 14:09.142
Just so you know, you're making
a pretty bad first impression.

14:09.553 --> 14:11.558
It's all my fault.

14:11.678 --> 14:15.269
Homer wanted to serve
those little cocktail hot dogs,

14:15.389 --> 14:20.031
but, no, I had to have spring rolls!

14:20.151 --> 14:21.676
They taste like nothing.

14:23.743 --> 14:28.145
I don't understand. Dad would never miss
an open bar with chicken wings.

14:28.415 --> 14:30.869
Plus, he loves Mom and us,
yadda, yadda, yadda.

14:30.989 --> 14:32.250
Hey, I found something!

14:35.613 --> 14:37.243
Sideshow Bob!

14:37.363 --> 14:38.863
He ruined the wedding.

14:38.983 --> 14:41.642
Getting his revenge on us at last!

14:41.762 --> 14:45.875
Because he knows that if Mom and Dad
don't get married, I'll never be born!

14:52.084 --> 14:54.899
I've got some wedding registry
items for Mrs. Simpson.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.603
I'm afraid I'm just Ms. Simpson now.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.293
Interesting nuance.

15:00.413 --> 15:04.430
I'd like to hear more about it,
but company policy forbids chit-chat.

15:05.978 --> 15:07.792
I miss you so much.

15:07.912 --> 15:11.272
<i>To remove that chain,
you need the key to the lock.</i>

15:11.392 --> 15:13.396
You idiot. How am I ever
gonna find the key to the--

15:14.069 --> 15:14.778
Oh, here it is.

15:17.231 --> 15:19.386
To get the key,
I have to lick through a lollipop?

15:20.250 --> 15:21.103
How awful!

15:22.669 --> 15:24.674
Ow! What the--

15:24.794 --> 15:27.455
<i>The lollipop is made of hot sauce.</i>

15:28.230 --> 15:29.909
Whose side are you on?

15:39.195 --> 15:42.388
Sideshow Bob, drop that knife,
and give back our dad!

15:42.670 --> 15:43.257
Oh?

15:44.056 --> 15:48.562
I'm working on a bust of Krusty,
and using this knife to aerate the clay.

15:50.264 --> 15:51.761
Anyone for peppermint tea?

15:51.881 --> 15:54.649
Not for me. But the monkey
needs to keep his strength up.

15:54.769 --> 15:57.762
We're gonna drop him out of
a blimp tomorrow, and see what happens.

15:58.572 --> 16:03.439
Oh, don't worry. Nothing's gonna
happen to you, Mr. Teeny Number 7.

16:03.559 --> 16:06.842
Bob, did you take any breaks
yesterday? To kidnap our dad?

16:06.962 --> 16:09.946
Impossible. I was with Bob the whole day.

16:10.066 --> 16:13.039
Then we watched the deluxe DVD
of the <i>House Of Sand and Fog.</i>

16:13.159 --> 16:15.255
At night, we slept in
the same bed for warmth.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.572
Then we woke up, had a little nosh,

16:17.607 --> 16:20.629
watched the <i>House Of Sand
and Fog</i> again, with commentary.

16:20.749 --> 16:21.893
The director was an ass.

16:21.928 --> 16:24.190
Fine, but how do you explain this?

16:24.485 --> 16:25.577
Nice of you to think of me.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.439
However, S.B. could be anyone.

16:28.665 --> 16:30.748
Scott Baio, the Sultan of Brunei,

16:30.783 --> 16:34.004
the former Poland secret police
the Służba Bezpieczeństwa.

16:34.508 --> 16:35.388
Or...

16:44.978 --> 16:47.291
<i>Marge, I miss you!</i>

16:48.665 --> 16:50.619
<i>I miss you so much!</i>

16:51.852 --> 16:53.911
Wait 'til he finds out
the key isn't the key.

16:54.031 --> 16:55.879
But just a hotter sauce.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.827
I'm gonna say this for the last time:

17:13.946 --> 17:17.734
Bart, if this is one of
your pranks, very funny.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.038
Maybe we should let him out soon.

17:20.157 --> 17:22.092
Not 'til Marge dumps him for good.

17:24.029 --> 17:26.395
Hey, Lame-o. Ready for some

17:26.515 --> 17:28.272
<i>fun with fire ants?</i>

17:28.393 --> 17:30.178
What's fun about fire ants?

17:30.213 --> 17:33.037
They're-- Oh, you're being sarcastic.

17:33.157 --> 17:35.891
<i>Wow! You're the
smartest guy in that room!</i>

17:36.011 --> 17:38.018
Thank you. That's very nice--

17:39.040 --> 17:40.786
More sarcasm.

17:42.712 --> 17:46.845
Just see that my fiancée Marge
gets this: my wedding vows.

17:47.420 --> 17:52.562
Marge, I hope this day is as perfect
for you as the day we met was for me.

17:52.682 --> 17:56.895
You always find the one grain
of sugar in the salt shaker that is I.

17:57.247 --> 17:59.624
With each marriage, I get a little better.

17:59.744 --> 18:02.601
Maybe after a thousand,
I'll be worthy of you.

18:02.721 --> 18:05.571
I miss you. I miss the kids.

18:05.606 --> 18:08.471
God help me, I even miss your sisters.

18:14.309 --> 18:15.301
Poor guy.

18:15.421 --> 18:17.068
He loves her so much.

18:17.188 --> 18:20.328
Excuse me, but I have been
waiting 45 minutes

18:20.363 --> 18:22.411
for you to slide my license over to me.

18:22.634 --> 18:23.552
Closed!

18:23.672 --> 18:25.843
Okay. You're hereby
banned from my store.

18:25.878 --> 18:28.468
You will have to shop at the
Kwik-E-Mart across the street from me.

18:28.588 --> 18:30.572
You know, the much nicer, much newer one.

18:30.692 --> 18:31.605
Good day to you!

18:33.407 --> 18:35.694
Mom, Mom! We know where Dad is!

18:35.814 --> 18:36.919
He's right here.

18:37.039 --> 18:38.624
I'm not sure what happened.

18:38.744 --> 18:44.122
I was kidnapped, then tortured,
then I fell into a surprisingly sound sleep.

18:44.242 --> 18:47.688
When I awoke, I felt refreshed.
And I was blindfolded,

18:47.808 --> 18:52.027
and two sobbing trolls threw me
out of a van onto our lawn.

18:52.147 --> 18:54.069
I'm just happy you're back.

18:54.189 --> 18:56.025
Now let's get that chain off you.

18:56.145 --> 18:58.667
Won't it dry up in a few days,
and fall off in the bath?

18:59.327 --> 19:01.620
I've missed your nonsense.

19:11.737 --> 19:14.747
Now there's no evidence
to tie us to the kidnapping.

19:14.782 --> 19:17.811
And we've got a one year lease
on that torture room.

19:17.931 --> 19:19.984
So maybe we could put
a tanning bed in there.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.099
We know it was you, Selma Bouvier.

19:29.992 --> 19:31.868
Would you kids like cookies?

19:31.988 --> 19:34.332
Let your Auntie Patty
make some cookies.

19:34.452 --> 19:36.132
We don't want your cookies.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.510
What she means is,
we'll eat your cookies later.

19:38.630 --> 19:40.270
If you don't want us to
tell our mom what you did,

19:40.305 --> 19:41.448
you're gonna have to pay.

19:41.568 --> 19:43.356
Pay? Pay for what?

19:43.476 --> 19:47.927
Ask her. She's the brains.
I'm the thing that's not the brains.

19:50.368 --> 19:52.997
And with the inking
and application of this stamp,

19:53.032 --> 19:54.449
you are officially married.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.053
Next.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.737
I'm sorry, honey. I wanted so badly
to give you a fancy wedding.

19:59.772 --> 20:04.461
Homer, one thing I've learned is
that you don't need a fancy wedding

20:04.496 --> 20:06.902
when you're marrying the man you love.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.766
Just what I always wanted!

20:22.555 --> 20:26.323
A rocket ship wedding cake!
Just what I always wanted!

20:27.556 --> 20:30.732
We emptied our 401(k)s for this?

20:34.017 --> 20:36.335
Blue roses!

20:36.455 --> 20:39.683
Yes, it took a lot of frantic
genetic engineering, but...

20:40.062 --> 20:40.828
Enjoy.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.161
No! You're a plant now!
