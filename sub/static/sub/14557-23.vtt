WEBVTT

00:29.830 --> 00:32.100
There's hardly anyone out.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.267
You complaining?

00:33.301 --> 00:36.570
No, it's just that big storm
last night.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.540
I think I read somewhere
the runoff is toxic.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.075
That's fascinating.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.144
Are you always such a
chick in the morning?

00:43.177 --> 00:44.545
Come on.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.779
Hey.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.820
Look.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.394
My God.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.474
All right, so you're good?

01:13.507 --> 01:15.309
All right, good. Bye.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.744
So, Dad's all right.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.746
He's going to take the shuttle
back from the airport.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.115
He appreciates that we at least
tried to pick him up.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.451
All right, well, I'm sorry
I had to drag you out here.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.419
-Oh, believe me, I don't mind.
-Hmm.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.820
Charlie, don't forget
this is a crime scene.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.422
-Right. -All right, don't go
touching anything.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.325
Hey, guys.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.560
We got four bodies
that washed up

01:32.593 --> 01:33.627
on the beach early
this morning.

01:33.661 --> 01:37.265
All Asian,
all female, no IDs.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.299
DON:
Any idea where they're from?

01:38.332 --> 01:40.434
It can't be too far away,
otherwise the bodies

01:40.468 --> 01:42.370
probably would've
drifted further apart.

01:42.403 --> 01:43.637
Coast Guard called us in.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.573
They're calling this a
crime on the high seas.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.841
Over there with Megan is
a marine science officer.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.210
He's supposed to know something

01:49.243 --> 01:50.511
about the local currents
out here.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.845
All right.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.659
What's Charlie doing?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.661
No idea.

02:07.695 --> 02:08.762
SCIENCE OFFICER:
Big storm, but we've had

02:08.796 --> 02:12.166
-very few distress calls
in the past 24 hours. -Yeah.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.268
-Hey, this is Special Agent
Eppes. -Hey, how're you doing?

02:14.302 --> 02:16.704
MEGAN:
And why is that you think?

02:16.737 --> 02:18.939
A storm that big keeps all
the small craft in port.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.874
And we had nothing
up near Palos Verdes

02:20.908 --> 02:22.543
that explains this.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.345
Wait. Why there?

02:24.378 --> 02:25.946
The prevailing
current in this area

02:25.979 --> 02:28.549
moves down
from the north.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.318
They were in the water
less than 24 hours.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.653
They had to go in off
Palos Verdes to end up here.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.655
-Uh...
-What?

02:34.688 --> 02:38.226
Yeah, but a flow from the north
wouldn't be sustaining

02:38.259 --> 02:39.693
rip currents in this bay.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.562
Well, that's
true, but, uh...

02:41.595 --> 02:42.630
I'm sorry, who are you?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.565
He's all right,
he's with us.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.467
You see those
surfers there?

02:46.500 --> 02:50.338
They're struggling against
a significant riptide.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.972
So I would say
that the coastal flow is moving

02:52.005 --> 02:55.576
counter to the prevailing
currents from the south.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.711
We do get rips when
the southwest swell starts

02:57.745 --> 02:59.680
-to push against the...
-What is that in the water?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.770
Hey, I got a heartbeat here.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.505
MAN:
Paramedic!

03:24.538 --> 03:25.706
Come on.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.516
We all use math every day,

03:35.549 --> 03:36.684
to predict weather,

03:36.717 --> 03:39.487
to tell time,

03:39.520 --> 03:43.757
to handle money.

03:43.791 --> 03:48.028
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

03:48.061 --> 03:53.033
It's logic... rationality.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.035
It's using your mind

03:55.068 --> 03:57.004
to solve the biggest mysteries
we know.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.814
Any theories on
how these girls

04:06.847 --> 04:08.949
ended up on the beach?

04:08.982 --> 04:11.752
I don't think they
were out for a swim.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.521
Yeah, it's tough to swim
with your shoes on.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.022
DON: All right, so nothing
from the Coast Guard.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.391
No witnesses, no distress calls.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.859
And what about the girl
you pulled from the ocean?

04:18.892 --> 04:20.060
Still unconscious.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.529
Actually, someone should
check her status

04:21.562 --> 04:22.930
and someone should talk
to the coroner and see

04:22.963 --> 04:24.732
if we can get those autopsies
fast-tracked, you know?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.968
You want to draw straws?

04:28.001 --> 04:29.403
Nah, I'll take the morgue.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.438
You can owe me one.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.705
Thanks.

04:31.739 --> 04:32.940
COLBY:
Hey, Don.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.708
Charter company called for you.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.577
-They said your boat's ready?
-All right.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.878
Your boat?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.880
Yeah.

04:39.913 --> 04:44.652
* I'm feelin' shot
from a cannon *

04:44.685 --> 04:45.719
* And I'm a human...

04:45.753 --> 04:47.721
CHARLIE: So we need to keep
dropping these buoys

04:47.755 --> 04:49.056
at one minute intervals.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.793
Right, and I am recording
the ID numbers.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.927
Then what?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.463
Well, then we use
the drift routes

04:55.496 --> 04:57.498
to identify what
I hope will be

04:57.531 --> 04:59.933
an atypical shift in
the local currents.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.702
Charlie, do you really
think we're going to see

05:01.735 --> 05:03.337
any of these buoys again?

05:03.371 --> 05:04.705
It's a very big ocean.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.906
Yeah, but for our objective,

05:05.939 --> 05:08.842
we really only need to be
looking for them in one place.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.545
Right. The beach where
the girls washed up.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.813
You got it.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.814
LARRY:
Charles?

05:13.847 --> 05:17.751
Is this practical exercise
really necessary?

05:17.785 --> 05:20.821
We could have produced
a highly functional

05:20.854 --> 05:23.824
theoretical result and
never left dry land.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.560
Larry, without
your kinematic flow mapping,

05:26.594 --> 05:28.429
we wouldn't know
where to drop these buoys.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.563
I know, I know.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.998
I know.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.634
All right, I'm going below
decks in a desperate search

05:33.667 --> 05:36.136
for more Dramamine.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.137
AMITA:
So last night ended up

05:37.170 --> 05:38.138
being pretty fun, huh?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.139
Yeah, that was fun

05:39.172 --> 05:42.510
for a lecture on theories
of axiomatic sets.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.045
Yeah, not exactly
the obvious outcome.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.414
( laughs ):
No.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.851
You know Claude Faugert

05:50.884 --> 05:54.087
is giving a lecture next week
on Point-Set Topology.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.525
Want to go together?

05:57.558 --> 05:59.427
Sure, why not?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.962
It'd be like, um...

06:01.995 --> 06:03.063
like a "math date"?

06:03.096 --> 06:05.499
I like that.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.800
Maybe there's hope for us.

06:17.745 --> 06:18.979
Hey.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.013
So you were at the hospital?

06:20.047 --> 06:21.482
She's in ICU.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.483
Yeah, and?

06:22.516 --> 06:25.085
There's complications
from the hypothermia.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.987
What, like, as in
not gonna make it?

06:27.020 --> 06:30.458
That's what the doctor says.
It doesn't look good.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.125
All right.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.765
Claudia?

06:37.798 --> 06:38.766
How you been?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.133
David?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.802
I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.904
Look, you have any idea
who's handling

06:43.937 --> 06:45.105
the four girls
from the beach?

06:45.138 --> 06:46.774
Yeah. Me.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.478
Claudia?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.446
Catching a lot of
homicide cases, okay?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.016
You have
a cause of death?

06:56.049 --> 06:57.885
Mmm, they drowned.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.520
Well, not that
surprising, but...

06:59.553 --> 07:03.056
all four showed signs
of acute dehydration.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.124
That's crazy.
You're surrounded by water,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.125
but still
you're dehydrated?

07:05.158 --> 07:07.194
The sea water actually
accelerates dehydration.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.662
It's the salt.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.197
But I'd say
tissue retraction started

07:10.230 --> 07:11.465
before they went in the water.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.000
Meaning?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.135
Meaning you can rule out
a luxury cruise.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.670
You have any idea
where they might be from?

07:16.704 --> 07:20.808
From what little
dental work there is,

07:20.841 --> 07:22.543
I'd say these three are
from mainland China.

07:22.576 --> 07:25.078
But this one
over here...

07:25.112 --> 07:28.248
She's had extensive
orthodontic work.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.117
I'd say she's American.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.685
Or at least grew up here.

07:31.719 --> 07:32.953
She's also older
than the other girls.

07:32.986 --> 07:33.754
25 or six.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.023
The rest are still
in their teens.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.858
COLBY:
How'd she end up in the water

07:37.891 --> 07:40.027
with three teenage girls
from China?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.732
If you can figure out
where she got that tattoo,

07:44.765 --> 07:45.866
might help you answer that.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.135
This was done recently.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.770
COLBY:
The bottom of her foot.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.038
How recent?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.607
The skin's fully healed,

07:53.641 --> 07:56.710
but from the keloid scarring,
I'd say a couple months.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.245
Maybe three.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.913
I'm sorry
I can't be more specific.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.515
Nah, don't be.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.235
It's so quiet.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.671
It's so early.

08:23.704 --> 08:27.274
It's damn early.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.210
Thanks for coming out here
with me again.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.012
Glad to help.

08:32.045 --> 08:35.082
It's actually nice
to be away from school.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.590
What would you think
of doing something else

08:42.623 --> 08:44.692
outside of school,
like seeing a movie?

08:46.193 --> 08:49.162
Are you asking me out
on a non-math date?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.031
Yeah, is that weird?

08:51.064 --> 08:52.232
No.

08:52.265 --> 08:55.969
I would like that.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.237
But, um...

08:57.270 --> 08:58.438
But what? Don't say "but."

08:58.471 --> 09:01.842
Come on, I know we've had
our problems this year, but...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.777
No, Charlie, it's not that.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.013
Susan Berry was not a big thing.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.981
She was here briefly

09:08.015 --> 09:11.184
and she couldn't wait
to get back to the UK.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.320
Charlie, I've been
offered a-a job.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.822
It's an...

09:14.855 --> 09:18.859
assistant professorship
in the Math Department.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.762
It's, um, at Harvard.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.232
Harvard?

09:25.265 --> 09:27.701
It's a three year appointment.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.903
It's Massachusetts Harvard.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.340
That's the one.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.743
That's...

09:35.776 --> 09:38.278
I mean that's...

09:38.311 --> 09:39.813
really amazing.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.085
Three years is a long time.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.691
Hey...

09:50.724 --> 09:52.392
Isn't that a third buoy?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.961
-What? Where?
-There.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.110
C-Eight.

10:10.143 --> 10:13.380
Well, that's enough data
to sustain your theory.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.748
Currents have shifted.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.884
Which means the
Coast Guard was looking

10:16.917 --> 10:19.286
for witnesses and survivors
in the wrong place.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.287
DAVID:
Colby get any hits

10:20.320 --> 10:21.321
on the tattoo?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.222
Nothing.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.424
It seems that the trail's
hit a wall.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.926
Maybe Charlie's
high seas adventure

10:25.959 --> 10:27.127
will give us
something, you think?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.395
Yeah, we could
use a break.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.364
Even if it does
require a math lesson.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.301
MEGAN:
Can we help you?

10:34.334 --> 10:38.338
This is Claudia Gomez
from the coroner's office.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.873
Oh, from the "you'll take

10:39.907 --> 10:41.208
the morgue
and I'll owe you one"?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.944
Excuse me?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.345
Ah, it's nothing.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.148
I brought over
the pathology reports.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.349
I didn't think
it should wait.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.751
What happened?

10:50.784 --> 10:52.052
One of the girls
from the beach,

10:52.085 --> 10:54.421
I found the H5N1 strain
in her system.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.422
H...

10:55.455 --> 10:57.424
H5N1.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.859
It's Bird Flu.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.437
The Center for Disease Control
has looked at this,

11:10.470 --> 11:12.740
and so far we've been lucky--

11:12.773 --> 11:14.742
the last pandemic flu killed
almost 50 million people.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.608
Right.
And I didn't think

11:15.642 --> 11:17.377
the bird flu was
contagious for people.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.278
Okay.

11:18.311 --> 11:21.448
H5N1 mostly effects
avian populations,

11:21.481 --> 11:23.183
but it spreads very quickly,

11:23.216 --> 11:24.952
and it will infect people

11:24.985 --> 11:26.486
if they come in contact
with the birds.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.420
So it can adapt.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.956
And rapidly.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.157
Now, the current strains

11:30.190 --> 11:32.425
of the virus settle
deep in the lungs,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.361
too deep for a cough
to get it airborne.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.462
But if it mutates...

11:35.495 --> 11:37.965
It could spread rapidly
through a human population.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.132
That's our fear.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.770
And most of us think that
it's only a matter of time.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.905
-Well, we think these girls
are Chinese. -Wait a minute,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.774
I was told we were talking
about a single case.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.841
MEGAN: We're investigating
several deaths,

11:47.875 --> 11:49.910
one case of the flu so far.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.211
DON: So what about
linking the girl

11:51.244 --> 11:52.345
to an outbreak in China?

11:52.379 --> 11:55.816
Yeah... well, Chinese government
hasn't exactly been open

11:55.849 --> 11:56.817
about their health issues.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.151
And what about a quarantine?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.520
Agent Eppes, we haven't had
a case of Avian Flu

12:00.553 --> 12:02.055
in North America yet,

12:02.089 --> 12:03.791
and what you're telling me
doesn't change that.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.793
So you're just going
to quash this?

12:05.826 --> 12:06.894
Our containment protocols
are useless

12:06.927 --> 12:08.929
if we don't know where the girl
contracted the flu.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.330
All right, well what
do you suggest we do,

12:10.363 --> 12:11.464
cover it up?

12:11.498 --> 12:12.465
I'm not saying
this isn't serious.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.466
It is deadly serious.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.868
But I don't think it's worth

12:14.902 --> 12:15.836
causing a widespread panic

12:15.869 --> 12:17.737
until we have more information
on the girl.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.443
CHARLIE:
So here's my theory.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.846
The storm caused
a sandbar to form

12:25.879 --> 12:27.214
at the north end of the bay.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.182
-Right. -The shift in
the bottom features

12:29.216 --> 12:30.517
disrupted the tidal flow.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.352
All right,
so it's like a car race.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.522
The flow around the track
is even and thus predictable.

12:35.555 --> 12:39.126
But let's say there's a crash--
the flow is disrupted,

12:39.159 --> 12:41.061
cars have to steer
around the wreckage.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.996
Now if they don't clear
that raceway,

12:43.030 --> 12:44.297
the flow is
permanently changed.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.900
The parallel isn't exact,
but you get the idea:

12:46.934 --> 12:47.968
-the currents shifted.
-All right.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.837
So where'd the girls
come from?

12:49.870 --> 12:50.904
Well, they were dumped

12:50.938 --> 12:52.172
in the inbound
shipping lanes,

12:52.205 --> 12:54.374
and these are
the approximate coordinates.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.076
All right, well, I mean,
the Coast Guard's

12:56.109 --> 12:57.444
going to have
to do another search.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.480
Hey, look, if the girl
with the flu was on a boat,

13:00.513 --> 13:01.514
then there's
a high probability

13:01.548 --> 13:02.515
she came into close quarters

13:02.549 --> 13:03.516
with other people.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.119
-Right. -If that virus
was able to mutate...

13:06.153 --> 13:08.155
I know, it might
be spreading big time.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.494
Hey, guys.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.528
AMITA:
Hey.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.930
If you're looking
for Charlie,

13:16.964 --> 13:18.131
I think he's at the FBI.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.132
Ah, shoot, yeah, I was.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.134
Don wanted me to drop off
these search grids

13:21.168 --> 13:22.135
from the Coast Guard.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.004
Well, I can take them
and give them to him.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.005
-Can you?
-Yeah.

13:25.038 --> 13:25.939
-Thanks.
-Sure.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.540
-Oop. -Oop.
-Hold on, let me get those.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.543
Boy, that's a strange tattoo.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.345
-Hmm.
-Thanks.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.247
Hey, wait a second.

13:34.281 --> 13:37.050
These characters,
are these from the I Ching?

13:37.084 --> 13:40.020
You know, we don't know
what those are, actually.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.521
What's the I Ching?

13:41.554 --> 13:44.291
Oh, it's an ancient book
of Chinese divination.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.959
It's still pretty influential.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.928
I-I think these are from there.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.897
Is this related
to the drownings?

13:49.930 --> 13:51.564
Yeah, it's a tattoo
we found on the bottom

13:51.598 --> 13:53.867
of one of
the dead girls' feet.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.468
That's a strange place
for a tattoo.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.904
Yeah, that's what
I thought, too--

13:56.937 --> 13:57.905
it's like a toe tag.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.306
But it got me thinking.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.441
I remembered there were
these guys in Special Forces

14:01.474 --> 14:04.044
that used to have their dog tags
tattooed on their bodies

14:04.077 --> 14:06.179
in case their heads were...
You know?

14:06.213 --> 14:07.447
You know, in case....

14:07.480 --> 14:10.417
And you think this young woman
might have similar inclinations

14:10.450 --> 14:12.585
toward post mortem
identification?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.087
Maybe.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.622
Do you have any idea

14:15.655 --> 14:17.357
what those characters
might mean?

14:17.390 --> 14:21.261
No. But...

14:21.294 --> 14:23.196
Well, I'm afraid
my own expertise

14:23.230 --> 14:25.032
is not that specific.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.399
But you may be
correct in thinking

14:26.433 --> 14:27.600
that it does mean something.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.601
How's that?

14:28.635 --> 14:31.038
-If I could just get you
to hold that. -Mm-hmm.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.105
See, each of these characters,

14:32.139 --> 14:33.173
that has its own

14:33.206 --> 14:37.310
unique correspondence
to its own unique number.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.511
For instance,

14:38.545 --> 14:41.548
if you're looking at 31.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.283
Wait a minute,
if these are all numbers,

14:43.316 --> 14:44.351
do you think it's possible

14:44.384 --> 14:45.418
this is some kind of code?

14:45.452 --> 14:47.487
Well, if it is, Charlie's
a code-breaking machine,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.089
and he should be back
really soon.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.624
Yeah, that'd be great,
we could use his help.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.994
You know, it's perfectly
understandable--

14:54.027 --> 14:56.063
a soldier's reasons
for tattooing himself--

14:56.096 --> 14:57.564
he's walking into war.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.499
But this girl,
now her tattoo

14:59.532 --> 15:01.234
begs the question:

15:01.268 --> 15:03.370
What was she walking into?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.509
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.111
Been going through
the ship information

15:11.144 --> 15:12.312
from the Port Authority.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.713
There were more
than 30 ships

15:13.746 --> 15:15.548
in the area Charlie gave us.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.250
All right, well, the coroner
said they were Chinese.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.418
Why don't you try
anything from Asia.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.521
All right.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.523
Yeah, that cuts it down a bit,

15:23.556 --> 15:26.659
-but we've still got... four or
five cargo ships. -Right, well,

15:26.693 --> 15:27.995
it wouldn't be the first time
they dumped bodies

15:28.028 --> 15:28.996
from those things, right?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.297
Yeah.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.101
Oh, Don, take a look at this.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.037
One of these ships can carry,
what--

15:37.070 --> 15:38.571
3,000, maybe 4,000
containers each.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.440
You realize we could be

15:40.473 --> 15:42.609
talking about 20,000 containers.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.278
No, David, we're talking
about one container.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.246
( sighs )

15:49.582 --> 15:53.020
We've tried every permutation
possible for a Caesar shift.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.754
Reading from left to right,
from right to left...

15:54.787 --> 15:56.356
LARRY: You know,
the I Ching is Chinese,

15:56.389 --> 15:57.357
maybe we need to consider

15:57.390 --> 15:58.691
phonetic characters.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.227
-I already did.
-And?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.761
There's only 37 symbols.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.730
Yeah, yeah, which doesn't
get us to 55 or 61.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.232
Okay, I know.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.634
-I do get it. -We've been
at this for six hours.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.137
Nope, six and a half.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.307
Ooh. Uh-oh,
this doesn't look good.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.044
No. Our breakthrough eludes us.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.645
What, are you guys
still thinking

16:18.678 --> 16:20.713
this is some kind of
encrypted message?

16:20.747 --> 16:22.315
It's too short to run
a crypt analysis.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.618
If it were longer,
I could run a Kasiski exam,

16:25.652 --> 16:28.521
or try an index-of-coincidence
assessment.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.690
All we have is
a mere ten digits.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.026
It's just not enough
for a frequency analysis.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.196
Well, maybe the problem is
the underlying assumption.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.231
I don't know,
maybe she's right,

16:38.265 --> 16:39.732
maybe we're looking
for complexity here

16:39.766 --> 16:41.601
when all there really is
is simplicity.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.470
Well, wait, how do you mean?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.004
Maybe it's not a code.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.280
Charles.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.582
It's a phone number.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.720
( dialing )

17:04.091 --> 17:05.024
It's ringing.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.562
It's going to voicemail.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.564
WOMAN ( over speakerphone ):
This is Susan Lim.

17:11.598 --> 17:15.502
If you've reached this number,
then... I guess I'm dead.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.105
Please call Jeremy Wang,
he's a reporter at the Tribune.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.639
Tell him what happened.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.641
( phone beeps )

17:21.674 --> 17:23.343
That's a message
from a dead woman.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.720
She's one of five women

17:33.753 --> 17:35.588
that washed up
on a beach yesterday.

17:35.622 --> 17:39.559
We don't know who they are
or where they came from.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.464
Her name's Susan Lim.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.600
We worked together.

17:47.634 --> 17:48.568
I'm sorry.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.278
Um, do you have any idea
how this might have happened?

17:58.311 --> 18:00.413
She called me
maybe three weeks ago.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.783
She'd gotten as far as Shanghai,

18:03.816 --> 18:07.420
and her cousin helped her
find a snakehead.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.756
Um, a "snakehead"?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.625
Yeah, someone who arranged
for her to get on a cargo ship.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.195
She said there was 20 women
on an 8'x40' container.

18:17.364 --> 18:20.167
-20 women.
-Yeah.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.668
Did she say the name
of the ship?

18:21.701 --> 18:24.137
I don't think she knew.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.239
She was working on a story?

18:26.273 --> 18:27.640
A book.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.676
Last year, we did
a series of articles

18:29.709 --> 18:31.711
on the underground
sex trade.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.913
We heard how they were
bringing the girls in.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.716
She convinced the publisher
to back an expose.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.921
And just like that
she could pull off

18:41.954 --> 18:43.656
going undercover in China?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.358
Susan's first-generation
Chinese-American,

18:45.392 --> 18:46.859
she grew up speaking Mandarin,

18:46.893 --> 18:49.296
and her mother's family's
still in Zhejiang Province,

18:49.329 --> 18:50.297
in the countryside.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.331
They helped her.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.665
Last thing she told me...

18:52.699 --> 18:56.803
she pulls this off,
she's a lock for a Pulitzer.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.641
Well, I'd really like
to look at her notes.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.522
So who is she?

19:16.389 --> 19:17.257
Who's who?

19:17.290 --> 19:19.559
Charlie, whenever
you look like this,

19:19.592 --> 19:21.828
it's always a problem
with a girl.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.464
Look like what?

19:26.799 --> 19:28.535
Michelle Robinson,
remember her?

19:29.836 --> 19:31.738
-Seventh grade?
-Yeah.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.374
When she wouldn't go with you
to the dance at school...

19:34.407 --> 19:37.877
you looked just
like this for a week.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.213
Amita got offered a job.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.648
A great job.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.516
But it's back East.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.917
Amita, huh?

19:44.951 --> 19:47.254
I thought you two
weren't, um...

19:47.287 --> 19:48.255
We weren't.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.990
-But lately...
-Oh, I see.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.393
So you decided not
to try so hard, huh?

19:53.426 --> 19:54.994
I guess that's part of it.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.865
I... I just felt like things
were finally starting to happen.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.768
So, uh, she might get
a job back East, huh?

20:01.801 --> 20:04.404
Well, she hasn't decided,
but it's Harvard.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.406
How can she pass that up?

20:06.439 --> 20:08.608
Mm.

20:08.641 --> 20:12.245
Well, you know, "starting
to happen" is, um...

20:12.279 --> 20:13.980
That's not really
worth fighting for.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.416
I think when you focus

20:16.449 --> 20:17.484
on your feelings
about her--

20:17.517 --> 20:18.951
your real ones--

20:18.985 --> 20:21.621
that, uh, you'll...
you'll know what to do.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.993
Can you pass the milk?

20:32.064 --> 20:35.368
( ship horn blows )

20:35.402 --> 20:37.003
( rock music plays )

20:41.541 --> 20:44.911
* I got a girl
so wicked and mean *

20:44.944 --> 20:48.448
* But she's got big breasts

20:48.481 --> 20:52.985
* When every time I slow down

20:53.019 --> 20:55.955
* She won't let me rest

20:55.988 --> 20:57.624
* She comes from hell

20:58.891 --> 21:00.427
* Oh!

21:00.460 --> 21:01.961
* That girl from hell

21:03.963 --> 21:06.666
* That girl from hell

21:06.699 --> 21:09.035
* Oh!

21:09.068 --> 21:11.771
* And she casts
a wicked spell... *

21:14.841 --> 21:15.942
DAVID:
Eight million containers

21:15.975 --> 21:17.877
pass through this port
every year, man.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.046
Phew! Wow.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.681
How we supposed
to find just one?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.450
I don't know.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.586
Given what might be in it,
we better figure that out.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.521
*

21:33.760 --> 21:35.995
DAVID: We think the ship might
have sailed from Shanghai.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.798
Shanghai. Well, that
narrows it down to two.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.701
The Li-Po, still here,
but unloaded.

21:41.734 --> 21:46.105
The other ship,
the Nankin 75% clear.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.575
All right. Well, we're
going to need you to search

21:48.608 --> 21:50.810
all the cargo still
on that ship.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.580
Now, you're talking about
more than a thousand containers.

21:53.613 --> 21:54.781
I'd have to pull every
able-bodied man I have

21:54.814 --> 21:55.782
for something like that.

21:55.815 --> 21:56.683
So pull them.

21:56.716 --> 22:00.453
What exactly are you guys
looking for?

22:00.487 --> 22:03.856
About 15 Chinese girls
locked up in a container.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.392
That's not going to be enough.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.593
Excuse me?

22:06.626 --> 22:09.929
Look, I hate to say it, but
a few undocumented workers--

22:09.962 --> 22:12.131
it's not a priority for us.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.033
We're more worried about a bomb.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.002
Now, look, this may qualify.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.404
I don't follow.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.005
We already found one
of the girls

22:19.038 --> 22:20.440
from the container.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.742
She had the Bird Flu.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.544
You got to be kidding me.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.746
No, I wish we were.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.449
Okay. We'll impound
every container left

22:29.482 --> 22:30.550
on the Nanking.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.885
Maybe we get lucky,
your girls are still on board.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.754
-And if they're not?
-Who unloaded the ship?

22:34.787 --> 22:37.056
Uh, longshoremen from 151

22:37.089 --> 22:39.759
worked both ships.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.094
Jack Morrison's the rep, but I
wouldn't count on much help.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.162
Why is that?

22:43.195 --> 22:47.434
Guys who work the docks--
not exactly Boy Scouts.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.804
MEGAN: I got a message
you're not releasing

22:51.838 --> 22:53.039
Susan Lim's notes.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.707
After you left,
I started thinking.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.909
Why is the FBI so interested
in these girls?

22:56.943 --> 22:58.945
Because a reporter,
your partner,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.780
was probably murdered.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.950
I get that, but you were already
on the case when this was just

23:03.983 --> 23:06.052
a Chinese girl being brought in
for the sex trade.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.554
I don't see how
that matters.

23:07.587 --> 23:08.921
When we were doing our story,

23:08.955 --> 23:11.524
we saw 12-year-old girls
being sold by their families.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.793
Prostitutes beaten by their
pimps, left on the sidewalk

23:13.826 --> 23:14.927
to die.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.429
We knew who was behind it.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.964
But they were hidden behind

23:17.997 --> 23:20.066
dummy import companies,
and we couldn't get to them.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.834
I don't see where this is going.

23:21.868 --> 23:22.969
We called the FBI.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.705
They said if it wasn't
terrorism, it wasn't a priority.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.474
But here you are now,

23:27.507 --> 23:29.709
the same FBI,
wanting her notes.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.545
It's just
a murder investigation.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.147
Agent Reeves,
if-if what you're looking for

23:35.181 --> 23:37.016
is related to Susan's death,

23:37.049 --> 23:38.651
these boxes are important.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.720
I can subpoena these
boxes, and her notes,

23:40.753 --> 23:42.689
and all of your
notes, all of it.

23:42.722 --> 23:46.225
You know my paper won't
give them up without a fight.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.729
The courts could take weeks,
months even, to sort it out.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.031
I just want to know
what happened to her.

23:52.064 --> 23:56.703
I'll give you the rest
of the story, but you can't

23:56.736 --> 23:59.672
run with it until
after I close the case.

24:01.173 --> 24:04.577
Nail whoever did this.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.717
The FBI the reason my guys

24:10.750 --> 24:12.785
on the Nanking are sitting
on their butts?

24:12.819 --> 24:14.887
That ship should have been
unloaded by now.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.156
We wouldn't be holding you up
if it weren't important.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.658
Important, huh?

24:18.691 --> 24:20.727
Poll numbers slipping
in Washington?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.795
We need your help
finding a container.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.532
It came off either
the Li-Po or the Nanking.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.033
We just take 'em off
the ship.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.167
We don't look inside.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.702
You run the
dockworkers' union,

24:29.736 --> 24:30.970
and you've never
heard anything

24:31.003 --> 24:32.872
about contraband coming
off these ships, huh?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.006
That's right.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.742
So we look
into your finances,

24:35.775 --> 24:38.177
we won't find anything
but union dues?

24:38.210 --> 24:40.279
We're looking for a container
that just came in.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.882
It's full of
Chinese girls.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.884
I don't know about anything
like that.

24:44.917 --> 24:45.752
I'll have a warrant

24:45.785 --> 24:47.086
for your books in
less than an hour.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.087
Okay, okay.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.558
I'll talk to the guys
who worked the ships.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.159
See what I can find out.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.360
If something got
through the port

24:54.393 --> 24:56.663
that shouldn't have, you ought
to be talking to Customs.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.630
They have a new security system.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.899
Uses some kind of algorithm
to figure out

24:59.932 --> 25:01.033
what boxes to search.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.101
I'm sorry.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.903
Did you just say algorithm?

25:06.238 --> 25:07.907
Hey.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.810
Dad just told me.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.245
Yeah. It stinks. Oh!

25:13.279 --> 25:15.314
Well, not for Amita, but...

25:15.347 --> 25:17.650
It's a great opportunity
for her.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.052
I just...

25:20.086 --> 25:23.956
Well, look, I mean,
maybe you should just go.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.125
What?

25:26.158 --> 25:28.060
Well, you know,
you get all those, uh,

25:28.094 --> 25:30.062
visiting professor offers,
right? So go visit.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.598
Man, we haven't even gone

25:31.631 --> 25:32.932
on a halfway decent date.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.301
I can hardly go chasing her
across the country.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.938
What's up? What do you need?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.673
That container-- it's gone.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.208
It's already been unloaded.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.676
But the port says

25:43.710 --> 25:45.578
they use some kind
of a security algorithm.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.680
Yeah. Yeah, it analyzes
a probability matrix

25:47.714 --> 25:50.316
for high-risk
or dangerous cargo.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.819
Ranks containers according
to threat potential.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.220
All right, good,
you know about it.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.122
I was on the team
that designed it.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.824
No way? Oh.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.326
You want to know
if you can use the algorithm,

26:00.359 --> 26:02.829
work backwards,
to find this container?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.764
Yeah. I mean, we have 15 girls--
they're going out

26:04.797 --> 26:06.766
into the workforce,
and-and...

26:06.799 --> 26:08.701
I mean, they might have
this deadly virus,

26:08.735 --> 26:10.603
so I don't know
what else to do.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.238
You realize the initial rate
of transmission

26:12.271 --> 26:13.305
for a disease like influenza

26:13.339 --> 26:15.274
-amongst prostitutes.
-Even I can do that math.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.710
So, let me know what
you get, all right?

26:17.744 --> 26:20.680
And don't worry, you're gonna be
all right. It'll be fine.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.720
( brakes squeaking )

26:31.157 --> 26:33.125
( sighs )

26:33.159 --> 26:35.127
Think this tip's
gonna pan out?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.896
It will if Morrison
believes your threat

26:36.929 --> 26:39.732
about getting a warrant
for his finances.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.001
That was no threat.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.670
( instrumental rock plays
quietly )

26:43.703 --> 26:45.404
Hey, guys,
I'll be right with you.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.207
Jack Morrison sent us over.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.413
That's your guy

26:54.446 --> 26:56.348
right over there.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.687
Wait a minute. You're serving
drinks to that kid?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.754
He said he was 21.

27:01.788 --> 27:02.755
What else did he say?

27:02.789 --> 27:05.925
Well, last couple nights, uh,

27:05.958 --> 27:08.895
he comes in
about this same time.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.897
Um, gets drunk
as fast as he can.

27:10.930 --> 27:15.802
Then he starts crying about,
uh, throwing girls off a ship.

27:15.835 --> 27:16.803
Did you call the police?

27:16.836 --> 27:18.037
I didn't think he was serious.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.906
Not until, uh,
Morrison came by,

27:19.939 --> 27:21.841
asked about Chinese girls.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.413
Hey, wait a minute!

27:36.756 --> 27:39.058
Raymond!

27:39.091 --> 27:41.260
FBI!

27:48.267 --> 27:49.435
FBI, Raymond!

27:51.003 --> 27:51.904
( brakes squealing )

27:55.975 --> 27:58.344
Hands behind your back.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.812
( panting )

27:59.846 --> 28:03.415
Why do they always run?

28:03.449 --> 28:04.383
'Cause we wear suits, man.

28:04.416 --> 28:07.086
Guys figure you can
outrun a guy in a suit.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.888
Stand up. Let's go.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.095
DON:
You work on the Li-Po?

28:16.128 --> 28:18.230
In the kusina.
Since I leave Manila.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.232
Well, I just spoke
to the hospital,

28:20.266 --> 28:22.101
and that last girl
didn't make it.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.270
So I'm looking at
you for five murders.

28:24.303 --> 28:25.772
( speaking foreign language )

28:25.805 --> 28:27.106
I don't understand
what you're...

28:27.139 --> 28:28.775
-I-I didn't hurt them.
-It doesn't matter.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.743
You were there. You want
to tell me what happened--

28:30.777 --> 28:31.844
maybe I can help you.

28:34.513 --> 28:38.150
One girl... she was sick.

28:38.184 --> 28:41.020
The captain call the people

28:41.053 --> 28:43.322
who pay him to bring the girls.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.857
They say kill the sick one.

28:44.891 --> 28:45.858
Who did he call?

28:45.892 --> 28:47.526
You know who he called?

28:47.559 --> 28:48.995
The other girls

28:49.028 --> 28:51.097
that went overboard--
they were sick, too?

28:52.965 --> 28:55.334
Five of them come on the ship
together.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.269
( speaks foreign language )

28:57.303 --> 28:58.470
I don't know
what that means.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.139
Farm... farm girls?

29:00.172 --> 29:02.008
Farm girls? Right.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.476
They... We throw those away,
then wait,

29:04.510 --> 29:07.146
see if any else get sick.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.414
You'd throw them away?

29:08.447 --> 29:09.381
The captain says

29:09.415 --> 29:12.819
he lose too much money
if he kill them all.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.954
Where are they now?

29:14.987 --> 29:17.156
Another box.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.424
In-In a box.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.826
The container?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.060
Yeah.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.028
And where is that?

29:22.061 --> 29:24.396
It's gone.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.935
Okay.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.536
Cobbled together some code.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.371
It will parse the cargo data.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.942
I appreciate the help.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.910
Is that the stuff
from the reporter?

29:37.944 --> 29:39.111
Yeah.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.346
Megan brought it over.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.348
It's the reporter's notes
on the illegal

29:42.381 --> 29:44.183
sex trade in Los Angeles.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.452
It's fairly disturbing.

29:46.485 --> 29:49.221
And you're going to use that
to reconsider the risk variables

29:49.255 --> 29:50.823
for the port security algorithm?

29:50.857 --> 29:53.092
Yeah.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.961
Is that going to be enough data?

29:54.994 --> 29:56.963
No, but this will be.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.598
Yeah. It's more
of the same from the FBI.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.133
Hey, uh, you know what?

30:01.167 --> 30:02.601
I know it's late,

30:02.634 --> 30:04.436
but can you do one
last thing for me?

30:05.972 --> 30:07.373
What do you need?

30:07.406 --> 30:09.208
This is a list

30:09.241 --> 30:11.510
of the companies that were used
to launder money.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.946
No. There's already a table
for that in the database.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.948
You already put it in?

30:15.982 --> 30:17.583
Yeah. I mean, I figured
that you're trying

30:17.616 --> 30:19.351
to find the owner
of this missing container,

30:19.385 --> 30:20.486
and you needed a way

30:20.519 --> 30:22.488
to connect the
import-export business

30:22.521 --> 30:23.555
with the sex trade.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.490
All right.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.226
We work pretty well together,
don't we?

30:27.259 --> 30:28.560
Actually, you're a little bossy.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.329
( laughs )

30:31.597 --> 30:33.966
I'm being serious.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.902
Serious about what?

30:35.935 --> 30:39.238
Greg Michaels is taking
a three-year sabbatical.

30:39.271 --> 30:40.372
Yeah, I heard.

30:40.406 --> 30:41.640
And to cover his course load,

30:41.673 --> 30:44.110
they're creating
an assistant professorship.

30:44.143 --> 30:45.544
You'd be a perfect candidate...

30:45.577 --> 30:49.381
for... that... job.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.383
Oh.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.089
What? Did I say something
I shouldn't have?

30:58.224 --> 31:00.326
I don't know, Charlie.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.929
It's just that my job
is starting to feel like

31:02.962 --> 31:05.231
it's all about your job.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.938
DAVID:
Coast Guard just called.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.140
Pulled another body out
of the water this morning.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.441
Another girl?

31:15.474 --> 31:17.176
No. Captain of the Li-Po.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.444
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.212
You think somebody
noticed the kitchen boy

31:20.246 --> 31:21.680
went missing from the ship,
and decided

31:21.713 --> 31:23.282
to start cleaning up
some loose ends?

31:23.315 --> 31:24.283
Yeah, seems that way.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.217
Whoever's doing the cleanup's

31:25.251 --> 31:27.619
got to know
that Nipay's talking to us.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.156
Yeah. What do you think
about that union guy?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.290
-Morrison?
-Yeah.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.191
I don't know.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.026
Why give us Nipay
in the first place?

31:34.060 --> 31:36.562
Wait a minute.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.965
Even a cabin boy gets
a phone call, right?

31:38.998 --> 31:41.934
Yeah. Let's find out
who Nipay called.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.037
CHARLIE:
So, the port security algorithm

31:45.071 --> 31:46.538
analyzes potential
terrorist threats.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.440
However, it misses things
like drugs,

31:48.474 --> 31:50.209
contraband,
even human cargo.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.344
So, we could potentially
stop a dirty bomb,

31:52.378 --> 31:55.481
but a pandemic flu
is in like Flynn?

31:55.514 --> 31:57.583
Not anymore.
Not anymore if this works.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.618
I love this part.

31:59.651 --> 32:03.555
So, the security algorithm uses
inputs like point of origin,

32:03.589 --> 32:07.093
the company shipping the goods,
the volume and type of cargo.

32:07.126 --> 32:08.460
It highlights trouble areas.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.963
Think of a... a dandelion?

32:10.997 --> 32:14.466
The ones you used to blow into
the wind when you're a kid.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.236
The algorithm evaluates the
threat potential of each seed.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.071
Harmless seeds are released.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.606
Bad seeds are identified

32:20.639 --> 32:21.873
and contained.

32:21.907 --> 32:25.377
So if we change the-the inputs,
we can track different seeds.

32:25.411 --> 32:28.214
Exactly, and I used
Susan Lim's research

32:28.247 --> 32:30.983
to create a whole new
set of input variables.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.619
So, you found the container?

32:33.652 --> 32:35.621
Containers. Plural.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.756
There's more than one?

32:37.789 --> 32:41.127
No, but there are limits to how
precise the algorithm can be.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.630
I ran it against the cargo
manifest of the Li-Po,

32:44.663 --> 32:48.367
and I narrowed it down
to four possibilities.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.169
One of the import companies

32:50.202 --> 32:51.703
on this list has
your container.

32:51.737 --> 32:53.239
Oh.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.174
DAVID:
Raymond Nipay-- he made a call

32:55.207 --> 32:57.109
to a private club
in Little Taipei.

32:57.143 --> 32:59.245
COLBY: It took some doing,
but we were able

32:59.278 --> 33:00.746
to sort through
the IRS database.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.448
We were able to run
down an owner--

33:02.481 --> 33:03.782
Steven Jintao.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.517
This guy not only
owns the private club

33:05.551 --> 33:08.254
but he also owns three
massage parlors in the area.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.588
We can definitely connect him
to the container?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.557
Yeah, using
the reporter's notes.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.525
Yeah, Jintao built
this little empire

33:13.559 --> 33:15.394
smuggling in Chinese girls.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.129
Got their families
to pay for the freight.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.597
Most of the time,
they had no idea

33:18.630 --> 33:20.066
what was happening to them
on the other end.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.134
Guy saw an opportunity
to exploit the girls

33:22.168 --> 33:23.235
on both sides of the smuggling.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.437
He brings them over,
and then he puts them to work

33:25.471 --> 33:26.805
in the massage parlors
and the clubs.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.175
Right. They promise them
the moon, they pimp them out.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.343
Pretty twisted version
of the American dream.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.212
-And where is he?
-DAVID: LAPD says he has

33:33.245 --> 33:34.446
an office at his club.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.148
Go get him. Let's go.

33:36.182 --> 33:40.086
( dance music playing )

33:40.119 --> 33:42.221
* They're gonna get ya,
they're gonna get ya *

33:42.254 --> 33:44.423
* They're gonna get ya, they're
gonna get ya *

33:44.456 --> 33:46.725
( singing in foreign language )

33:46.758 --> 33:48.760
* They're gonna get ya

33:48.794 --> 33:50.829
* They're gonna get ya,
they're gonna get ya *

33:50.862 --> 33:52.298
* They're gonna get ya

33:52.331 --> 33:55.033
( singing in foreign language )

33:59.605 --> 34:01.307
* You got to be strong enough

34:01.340 --> 34:03.342
* You got to be cool enough

34:03.375 --> 34:05.077
* You got to be wild enough...

34:05.111 --> 34:08.380
( singing in foreign language )

34:08.414 --> 34:11.317
We're the only white
people in here.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.585
Yes, we are.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.454
Probably already made us.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.855
We don't exactly blend in.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.091
* They're gonna get ya,
they're gonna get ya *

34:19.125 --> 34:20.392
* They're gonna get ya...

34:20.426 --> 34:21.660
Hi.

34:21.693 --> 34:24.363
Are you looking
for a girlfriend?

34:24.396 --> 34:26.198
Actually, we're looking

34:26.232 --> 34:27.299
for this guy right here.

34:37.276 --> 34:40.812
( singing in foreign language )

34:45.884 --> 34:47.653
WOMAN:
I've never seen him.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.094
There's another one running.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.301
He's moving out the back.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.902
Yeah, yeah.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.137
Get down on the car.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.375
We're looking for the
girls from the Li-Po.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.410
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.744
Really? 'Cause I think you do.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.480
( groans ):
That hurts.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.514
I'll start the search.

35:15.547 --> 35:16.915
You guys with me.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.385
Where's the container?

35:19.418 --> 35:21.153
I want my lawyer.

35:21.187 --> 35:22.588
That wasn't the question.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.290
( groans )

35:31.863 --> 35:33.565
We lost his paperwork
last night,

35:33.599 --> 35:35.767
but we're gonna have to let him
talk to his lawyer.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.769
Fine, let the lawyer
file a writ.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.505
MEGAN: We're not giving them
a technicality

35:39.538 --> 35:40.872
they can use in court.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.641
Megan, we're talking about
a pandemic flu here.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.843
I don't really care
about a technicality.

35:44.876 --> 35:45.844
Don, we have enough information

35:45.877 --> 35:48.547
to put this slime-bag
down a very deep hole.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.316
It's not deep enough, not yet.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.454
Okay, Granger,
explain to me why it is

35:55.487 --> 35:57.756
we only care about these girls
when there's a risk

35:57.789 --> 35:59.758
that their customers
might get sick.

35:59.791 --> 36:00.792
DON:
Captain called you.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.461
And you told him
to throw that girl

36:02.494 --> 36:03.762
and everyone with her
in the water.

36:03.795 --> 36:04.863
You know how I know that?

36:04.896 --> 36:08.234
One of those girls was
a reporter working a story.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.635
You're lying.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.570
One more of those girls
gets sick...

36:11.603 --> 36:13.439
I'd like to go back to my cell.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.974
You're not going anywhere,
you understand me, you slime?!

36:16.007 --> 36:17.609
You're gonna sit down
and tell me exactly

36:17.643 --> 36:18.577
what I want to know!

36:18.610 --> 36:19.778
COLBY:
Don! Don!

36:19.811 --> 36:21.547
Take a break, okay?

36:24.650 --> 36:27.953
Let him call his lawyer,
and then throw him in that hole.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.790
Stop it.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.392
What?

36:33.425 --> 36:36.462
Okay, maybe we should
just take a break, huh?

36:36.495 --> 36:39.365
I'm all right, I'm just a little
distracted at the moment.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.299
Yeah? What, Amita?

36:40.332 --> 36:42.534
How'd you know?

36:42.568 --> 36:45.437
The look--
I know all your looks.

36:45.471 --> 36:48.274
Have you been conferring
with my father?

36:48.307 --> 36:49.275
No.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.309
Hey, Charlie.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.410
Look, we're in trouble here.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.912
I mean, I can't get anything
out of this guy Jintao.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.314
Those girls are still out there,

36:55.347 --> 36:57.283
not to mention
the threat of pandemic flu.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.318
We've been working on
a destination probability matrix

36:59.351 --> 37:02.954
using Susan Lim's notes, your
list of Jintao's businesses...

37:02.988 --> 37:04.356
That's why I'm here.
What do you got?

37:04.390 --> 37:05.691
Something's not
right in the data

37:05.724 --> 37:07.493
or there's a bug
somewhere in this matrix.

37:07.526 --> 37:10.462
Because my equation keeps
returning an empty set.

37:10.496 --> 37:11.930
LARRY:
Wait a second.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.164
Hold on here.

37:13.198 --> 37:20.372
What if, Charles, what if the
matrix equation is working?

37:20.406 --> 37:21.840
What if?
Then we'd have an answer.

37:21.873 --> 37:26.712
Yeah, but what if
the empty set is the answer.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.980
They never left the port.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.516
The algorithm wasn't
pointing to a destination,

37:30.549 --> 37:33.485
because the girls never left
their starting point.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.356
( typing )

37:37.389 --> 37:39.325
Green Jade Corp?

37:41.827 --> 37:42.994
No.

37:43.028 --> 37:46.031
What's that, like,
strike number 12?

37:46.064 --> 37:47.132
We just need

37:47.165 --> 37:50.436
one warehouse to match
one of Jintao's businesses.

37:52.538 --> 37:53.905
How about this.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.741
Let's sort them

37:55.774 --> 37:57.609
according to when
they took the space.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.347
Maybe Jintao had to rent

38:01.380 --> 38:02.714
something new to
store the container.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.051
Wai Gong Imports.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.052
Company signed a lease

38:07.085 --> 38:09.321
the day before
we found the girls on the beach.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.926
You said Wai Gong?

38:14.960 --> 38:15.794
Yeah.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.996
We got him.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.465
Yeah. Nice.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.468
( sirens blaring )

38:31.543 --> 38:33.479
This is the building
Wai Gong Imports subleased.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.459
I have movement inside.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.744
You guys, cover the warehouse!

39:18.790 --> 39:21.126
We got to get them out of there.

39:21.159 --> 39:22.260
We can't, not yet.

39:22.293 --> 39:25.096
We need to get a medic and
a translator in here now!

39:25.130 --> 39:27.933
Ladies, just give us
a minute, okay?

39:30.001 --> 39:33.004
So your guy Jintao used this
warehouse for quarantine?

39:33.038 --> 39:35.140
Till he decides
to cut his losses, yeah.

39:35.173 --> 39:38.376
He just left
these ladies here to die.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.717
So none of the girls
turned up with the flu?

39:45.751 --> 39:47.085
Well, they're still
under quarantine.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.756
But so far, it looks like
we got lucky, this time.

39:50.789 --> 39:55.026
Susan's publisher
offered me a book deal.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.795
They want me to write
about what happened

39:56.828 --> 39:58.797
to her, the girls, all of it.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.832
Well, it's a heck of a story.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.535
Maybe you'll be the one who
ends up with a Pulitzer.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.871
It'd be nice to say
that Susan's

40:05.904 --> 40:09.675
up there somewhere,
looking down, happy about this.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.777
But...

40:11.810 --> 40:13.144
She was so damn competitive.

40:13.178 --> 40:17.883
I'm sure she's furious
that I landed an exclusive.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.754
Well, we did bring
down Steven Jintao,

40:22.788 --> 40:24.790
and we rescued the girls
from the container.

40:24.823 --> 40:27.759
We couldn't have done any of
that without Susan's notes.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.895
That is something
she can be happy about.

40:29.928 --> 40:30.862
Oh, yeah.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.738
( knocking )

40:39.771 --> 40:41.006
May I come in?

40:41.039 --> 40:42.541
Oh, yeah.

40:42.574 --> 40:43.642
Yeah.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.845
Sure.

40:48.880 --> 40:53.519
I wanted to say that I'm sorry
about yesterday.

40:53.552 --> 40:57.789
You were just trying to help,
and I was out of line.

40:57.823 --> 41:00.992
Actually... I think
you were right.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.994
Not too long ago,

41:03.028 --> 41:06.932
you made the point that my work

41:06.965 --> 41:10.802
and my work for the FBI

41:10.836 --> 41:12.938
got in the way
of personal relationships.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.072
Yeah, I remember.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.542
Just... let me finish.

41:16.575 --> 41:19.745
You said a relationship
could work,

41:19.778 --> 41:22.113
but only if I was willing.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.683
I was talking about Don.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.552
I was talking
about your brother.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.687
Were you?

41:30.789 --> 41:31.957
-It's not...
-Charlie...

41:31.990 --> 41:34.960
fair of me to ask you

41:34.993 --> 41:37.095
to sacrifice your career

41:37.128 --> 41:39.164
if I'm not willing
to sacrifice mine.

41:41.266 --> 41:44.770
Thank you for that.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.706
This year turned out a whole lot
differently than I'd expected.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.210
Yeah, for me, too.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.281
So what are we going to do?

41:59.350 --> 42:01.119
Well, Harvard called.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.088
And they need
an answer by next week.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.194
So what are you
going to do?

42:11.262 --> 42:13.098
I don't know.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.702
I really don't know.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.572
Charlie...

42:22.307 --> 42:24.810
* Why would I ever

42:24.843 --> 42:28.279
* How could I ever

42:28.313 --> 42:31.249
* Let you go?

42:34.319 --> 42:36.822
Oh, that's it,
that's gin, kid.

42:36.855 --> 42:38.089
-Again?!
-Yep.

42:38.123 --> 42:40.626
How do you get so lucky?

42:40.659 --> 42:42.327
So you owe me 120 bucks.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.229
-What?! -Unless of course
you want to go again.

42:44.262 --> 42:45.230
I'm taking you down.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.297
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

42:46.331 --> 42:47.599
-All right.
-And I'm dealing.

42:47.633 --> 42:48.900
-No, it's my deal.
-No, I'm dealing.

42:48.934 --> 42:50.035
-It's my deal.
-No, you cheat.

42:50.068 --> 42:51.837
I cheat? Listen to this guy.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.238
ALAN: Hey, Charlie,
would you figure the odds

42:53.271 --> 42:54.640
on your brother
winning 11 games

42:54.673 --> 42:56.241
of gin in a row
if he's not cheating?

42:56.274 --> 42:58.243
DON: He's the one who taught me
how to count cards.

42:58.276 --> 42:59.645
Was that Amita?

42:59.678 --> 43:01.312
Yeah.

43:01.346 --> 43:03.048
She just left.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.316
Yeah? So you moving back East?

43:05.350 --> 43:07.686
No. No, I'm not
moving to Massachusetts.

43:07.719 --> 43:09.655
Ah, come on, Bruins games, pal.

43:09.688 --> 43:10.622
Season tickets.

43:11.757 --> 43:13.124
What about Amita?

43:15.093 --> 43:16.695
I'm not sure.

43:16.728 --> 43:17.929
You all right?

43:17.963 --> 43:21.299
I'm not sure about that either.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.206
He's gonna love Beantown.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.408
Especially in the winter.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.043
Oh, yeah.

43:32.077 --> 43:33.078
Can't go to
Red Sox games, though,

43:33.111 --> 43:34.079
that's the thing, right?

43:34.112 --> 43:35.146
No Red Sox games.

43:35.180 --> 43:36.114
No cheating.
