00:15.932 --> 00:18.432
I took some pictures
of Pastor Tim's diary.

00:18.468 --> 00:21.602
I didn't want to take the film
to Fotomat or anything.

00:21.638 --> 00:25.506
Pastor Tim thinks
I might really be screwed up.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.508
He's worried about my soul.

00:27.544 --> 00:28.776
It's a boarding school,

00:28.811 --> 00:30.578
so I would live there
during school,

00:30.613 --> 00:32.746
and then I'd come home
vacations.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.815
Henry knows
what he wants.

00:35.850 --> 00:38.685
I think
he'd be better off.

- Henry.
- One sec.

00:57.371 --> 00:58.571
Where's Mom?

00:58.606 --> 01:00.005
I don't know.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.773
She didn't say
where she was going?

01:01.809 --> 01:03.475
I don't think so.

01:05.045 --> 01:06.812
Chris says we're supposed to
hear from St. Edwards

01:06.847 --> 01:08.180
in the next week or two.

01:12.519 --> 01:16.321
So are you gonna let me go
or what?

01:22.529 --> 01:26.363
Henry, if you get in...

01:26.398 --> 01:28.164
I'm gonna have
to talk to your mother,

01:28.200 --> 01:31.468
but... fine.

01:31.503 --> 01:32.736
It's fine by me.

01:34.607 --> 01:35.972
Thanks, Dad.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.412
Uh, I'm gonna go out.

01:42.448 --> 01:44.012
Tell Mom I'll be back
by eight.

01:44.048 --> 01:45.381
- Okay.
- Yeah.

Moving forward.

04:06.437 --> 04:08.537
What about
your pastor?

04:08.572 --> 04:11.874
Paige is open to finding
a new place for him.

04:11.909 --> 04:13.375
That's very
good news.

04:13.411 --> 04:14.476
Yeah.

04:15.212 --> 04:17.245
I'll see what
we can do.

04:24.053 --> 04:26.020
The Centre thinks
they might have found

04:26.055 --> 04:28.756
a woman named
Anna Mikhaylovna Prokopchuk,

04:28.792 --> 04:31.926
who they've been
looking for for years.

04:31.961 --> 04:33.193
A collaborator

04:33.229 --> 04:35.496
who was on
a Nazi execution squad.

04:37.633 --> 04:38.865
Here?

04:40.536 --> 04:42.836
She personally shot
hundreds of our boys.

04:43.872 --> 04:45.772
Prisoners.

04:45.808 --> 04:47.340
They used to line
them up around a pit

04:47.375 --> 04:49.943
at the edge
of town...

04:49.978 --> 04:52.646
in Dyatkovo.

04:52.681 --> 04:54.313
Where is she?

04:54.348 --> 04:55.881
Newton,
Massachusetts.

04:55.917 --> 04:58.417
Her husband was a medic
in the American army.

04:58.453 --> 05:01.219
They met in Germany
after the War.

05:01.255 --> 05:02.254
She's been living
under the name

05:02.289 --> 05:04.990
of Natalie Granholm
since the '50s.

05:07.328 --> 05:08.461
But
we're not--

05:08.496 --> 05:09.995
we're not
sure it's her?

05:10.030 --> 05:11.963
They can't find
any exit documents

05:11.998 --> 05:13.064
matching the
maiden name

05:13.099 --> 05:14.933
she used when she came
to America.

05:14.968 --> 05:16.267
And any photos of her

05:16.302 --> 05:18.302
were destroyed
during the occupation.

05:21.307 --> 05:22.902
Except
for this.

05:26.513 --> 05:29.613
The Centre wants you to find out
everything you can.

05:29.648 --> 05:32.282
We'll make sure it's her
before we do anything.

05:38.491 --> 05:41.024
I looked into
what you asked me about.

05:42.862 --> 05:45.027
The Centre
did harvest and weaponize

05:45.062 --> 05:47.497
the Lassa virus you recovered
from William.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.501
They named it Variant V.

05:52.904 --> 05:55.505
For Vitaly.

05:55.540 --> 05:56.639
His Russian name.

06:09.817 --> 06:11.099

06:15.610 --> 06:16.695

06:17.629 --> 06:21.157

06:23.029 --> 06:24.207

06:28.564 --> 06:32.814

06:33.591 --> 06:36.576

06:37.796 --> 06:41.156

06:42.145 --> 06:46.213
_

06:49.164 --> 06:52.186
_

06:59.405 --> 07:01.478
_

07:10.176 --> 07:12.743
Henry asked about
St. Edwards again.

07:15.748 --> 07:19.984
I-I said he could go,
if it's okay with you.

07:20.019 --> 07:21.518
Which it is.

07:25.658 --> 07:27.290
I think if he wants to go,

07:27.325 --> 07:28.424
he should go.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.726
Yeah.

07:29.761 --> 07:30.594
I just thought...

07:30.629 --> 07:32.996
he's doing

07:33.031 --> 07:34.430
really good now.

07:34.466 --> 07:35.398
All this math stuff.

07:35.433 --> 07:37.567
A girlfriend.

07:37.603 --> 07:39.636
It's all just...

07:39.671 --> 07:40.937
working out.

07:46.443 --> 07:47.910
If he gets in,

07:47.945 --> 07:50.178
he'll be there
for a couple of months,

07:50.214 --> 07:51.814
back home,

07:51.849 --> 07:53.682
then gone
for another couple of months,

07:53.718 --> 07:57.052
and back home again...

07:57.088 --> 07:58.621
Yeah.

08:27.983 --> 08:29.549
They like each other.

08:29.584 --> 08:31.051
Good for them.

08:35.990 --> 08:37.722
How many people
work here?

08:37.759 --> 08:39.692
Hmm.
That is a good question.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.693
Hey, Dennis.

08:42.030 --> 08:44.063
This is my friend
Henry Jennings.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.398
You work for the <i> Post?</i>

08:46.433 --> 08:49.001
Oh. No, I'm just writing
a school paper.

08:49.037 --> 08:51.836
Hey, you got any idea
how many people work here?

08:51.872 --> 08:53.872
Eh. Not a clue.

08:53.907 --> 08:55.774
Hey.
Make sure you check out

08:55.809 --> 08:57.608
the new soap dispensers
in the bathrooms.

08:57.644 --> 08:59.177
Aderholt.

09:01.214 --> 09:02.547
Well, duty calls.

09:02.582 --> 09:04.348
- Nice meeting you, Henry.
- You too.

09:04.384 --> 09:06.051
Thanks.

09:09.689 --> 09:11.155
Who's that other guy?

09:11.190 --> 09:13.323
That's Agent Wolfe.

09:13.358 --> 09:15.192
- My boss.
- Mm.

09:17.096 --> 09:18.228
What's that?

09:18.263 --> 09:20.397
That is the vault.

09:20.432 --> 09:21.865
What do you do
in there?

09:21.901 --> 09:24.168
Secret stuff.

09:24.203 --> 09:25.402
- Mm.
- Come on.

09:26.537 --> 09:28.171
It's actually
a secure room.

09:28.206 --> 09:29.471
What does that mean?

09:29.507 --> 09:31.708
It's got
acoustic shielding.

09:31.743 --> 09:33.810
There's no way anyone
can possibly listen in on

09:33.845 --> 09:35.211
what you're saying
in there.

09:35.246 --> 09:36.278
- Really?
- Yep.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.613
Can we go in?

09:37.648 --> 09:38.915
- Uh, no.
- Oh.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.087
It's a mail robot.

09:45.122 --> 09:46.722
What does it do?

09:46.757 --> 09:49.224
It delivers mail.

09:49.259 --> 09:50.859
That is so cool!

09:50.894 --> 09:53.294
Eh. It's more trouble
than it's worth.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.700
_

11:11.447 --> 11:13.224
_

11:15.333 --> 11:16.865
_

11:22.633 --> 11:23.792
_

11:24.374 --> 11:27.296
_

11:32.419 --> 11:35.420
_

11:36.124 --> 11:37.481
_

11:38.460 --> 11:39.787
_

11:40.184 --> 11:41.992
_

11:43.954 --> 11:45.484
_

11:57.347 --> 11:59.579
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:59.614 --> 12:01.715
- How was it?
- It was great.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.416
I got to meet
Stan's boss--

12:03.452 --> 12:04.885
who's the head
of counterintelligence,

12:04.920 --> 12:06.586
and I met his partner,
Dennis--

12:06.621 --> 12:08.822
they work on
cases together.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.523
There was
this whole computer room

12:10.559 --> 12:12.659
with humongous computers in it,
too,

12:12.694 --> 12:14.828
and there's
this other room,

12:14.864 --> 12:16.863
it was called the vault.

12:16.898 --> 12:18.397
Nobody can hear you
when you're in there.

12:18.432 --> 12:20.199
What do you mean?

12:20.235 --> 12:23.236
Well, people can't listen in
to your conversations.

12:25.473 --> 12:27.373
- You hungry?
- Nah.

12:27.408 --> 12:30.476
Me and Stan stopped off
at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

12:30.511 --> 12:32.578
I'm gonna go write this while
it's still fresh in my head.

12:32.613 --> 12:34.179
Okay.

12:57.103 --> 12:59.703
Who the hell knows.

12:59.738 --> 13:03.207
I think it looks like her.

13:09.147 --> 13:12.048
Think Stan wants Henry
to join the FBI?

13:12.083 --> 13:14.217
Maybe.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.286
Matthew certainly
isn't cut out for it.

13:16.321 --> 13:18.388
He could clean up
and go straight

13:18.423 --> 13:20.256
when he gets older.

13:20.292 --> 13:22.959
I think the die's cast
with that one.

13:22.994 --> 13:25.794
- Well he's not getting Henry.
- No.

13:29.366 --> 13:32.067
Do you think Paige wanted us
to see those photos?

13:34.972 --> 13:36.838
I don't know.

13:36.873 --> 13:38.673
She already told us.

13:40.477 --> 13:42.376
But... maybe she wanted
to see us

13:42.412 --> 13:43.978
read them
right in front of her.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.854
Or she was just
moving too fast.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.964
_

15:46.757 --> 15:48.486
_

15:50.726 --> 15:52.538
_

15:54.003 --> 15:57.356
_

15:59.292 --> 16:01.599
_

16:01.972 --> 16:05.354
_

16:07.137 --> 16:09.504
_

16:10.876 --> 16:12.698
_

16:13.990 --> 16:15.066
_

16:16.041 --> 16:19.418
_

16:19.689 --> 16:22.473
_

17:02.594 --> 17:04.337
_

17:14.001 --> 17:15.451
_

17:15.848 --> 17:17.582
_

17:23.631 --> 17:25.987
_

17:27.202 --> 17:29.335
Her husband.
He's an ophthalmologist.

17:29.370 --> 17:31.304
What does she do?

17:31.339 --> 17:34.139
She's a nurse.
Works part-time now.

17:34.175 --> 17:35.574
They have two daughters.

17:35.609 --> 17:38.443
One lives in Portland, Oregon,
the other in Boston.

17:38.479 --> 17:40.679
She takes
a drawing class.

17:40.715 --> 17:42.647
What else?

17:42.683 --> 17:45.350
She volunteers
at a free clinic in Southie.

17:45.385 --> 17:47.319
Takes care of her granddaughter
two days a week,

17:47.354 --> 17:49.521
in the morning.

17:49.556 --> 17:53.357
She's made a nice life
for herself.

17:53.592 --> 17:55.692
How did we find her?

17:55.728 --> 17:58.796
When the Red Army
took back Dyatkovo,

17:58.831 --> 18:00.965
Anna Prokopchuk
wasn't there.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.467
Turns out she was
in a hospital in Germany...

18:03.502 --> 18:05.702
getting treatment
for a venereal disease,

18:05.738 --> 18:09.139
which she got from sleeping
with too many Nazi officers.

18:09.174 --> 18:11.141
We didn't know it
until last year.

18:11.176 --> 18:13.376
Since then we've been
tracking down medical records

18:13.412 --> 18:15.078
in the Nazi archives,

18:15.113 --> 18:17.414
looking at women
with venereal diseases

18:17.449 --> 18:19.115
in hospitals in Germany.

18:19.151 --> 18:21.918
They found a woman
named Natalya Konina...

18:21.954 --> 18:23.619
her height and age

18:23.655 --> 18:25.787
were a close match
to Anna Prokopchuk.

18:25.823 --> 18:28.857
And Konina
married John Granholm.

18:28.892 --> 18:31.626
So, Konina is Prokopchuk,

18:31.662 --> 18:34.096
or someone who was
the same height and age

18:34.131 --> 18:36.165
as she was
at the end of the War.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.666
Yes.

18:41.339 --> 18:43.237
I'll get these
to the Centre.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.308
"The hallowed halls of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation

18:47.344 --> 18:48.676
are abuzz with activity

18:48.711 --> 18:50.811
as agents struggle
to keep our country safe

18:50.847 --> 18:53.514
from threats
both foreign and domestic."

18:55.618 --> 18:58.019
Laying it on a--
a little thick if you ask me.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.354
It's amazing there.
It's the FBI.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.189
You have, like,
the best job in the world.

19:03.525 --> 19:05.125
Sometimes.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.461
Well,
what's not great about it?

19:07.496 --> 19:10.130
Well, uh...

19:10.165 --> 19:14.434
The FBI is basically...

19:15.971 --> 19:18.504
You know, I can't explain it
to you, Henry.

19:18.539 --> 19:20.139
Because I don't trust you.

19:20.174 --> 19:21.707
You don't trust me?

19:21.742 --> 19:23.809
No.
I'm not allowed to.

19:24.912 --> 19:26.945
You are the greatest kid
in the world,

19:26.981 --> 19:30.916
but I have to think of you
like you could be a spy.

19:30.951 --> 19:33.018
That's what the FBI
is like.

19:35.022 --> 19:37.922
So... are you allowed
to trust anybody?

19:39.592 --> 19:42.494
Some people
trust their wives.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.996
I didn't trust mine.

19:45.032 --> 19:47.399
I have no idea why.

19:47.434 --> 19:50.901
Well,
what about your kids?

19:50.936 --> 19:53.103
Not really.

19:53.139 --> 19:55.039
That sucks.

19:56.575 --> 19:57.707
Yup.

20:16.037 --> 20:18.853
_

20:19.479 --> 20:24.648
_

20:25.063 --> 20:30.391
_

20:30.947 --> 20:37.948
_

20:38.534 --> 20:41.094
_

20:41.430 --> 20:45.216
_

20:46.329 --> 20:51.566
_

20:53.322 --> 20:58.716
_

20:59.867 --> 21:02.069
_

21:02.339 --> 21:04.313
_

21:04.564 --> 21:08.706
_

21:09.331 --> 21:12.343
_

21:12.431 --> 21:17.188
_

21:17.682 --> 21:20.543
_

21:21.195 --> 21:26.171
_

21:28.350 --> 21:32.561
_

21:42.333 --> 21:45.701
_

21:45.905 --> 21:51.502
_

21:53.992 --> 21:56.509
_

21:59.256 --> 22:05.806
_

22:06.170 --> 22:08.560
_

22:10.929 --> 22:15.342
_

22:16.276 --> 22:19.361
_

22:20.765 --> 22:23.545
_

22:26.819 --> 22:29.660
_

22:31.159 --> 22:33.271
_

22:33.620 --> 22:40.026
_

22:42.216 --> 22:47.840
_

22:48.918 --> 22:54.352
_

22:55.892 --> 22:59.830
_

23:33.071 --> 23:34.471
Natalie Granholm.

23:36.574 --> 23:38.208
And they're sure it's her?

23:38.243 --> 23:40.910
It just says to go ahead.

23:42.514 --> 23:44.614
They saw the same pictures
we saw.

23:48.185 --> 23:49.485
I think it looks like her.

23:51.322 --> 23:53.989
Don't you?

23:54.025 --> 23:55.857
Maybe.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.893
But I want to be sure,
before...

23:59.463 --> 24:01.130
I can't just get
this order from them

24:01.165 --> 24:05.699
and do whatever they say.

24:05.735 --> 24:08.869
I'm not just...

24:08.905 --> 24:11.172
We talked about this.

24:11.207 --> 24:12.840
We'll make sure.

24:18.348 --> 24:19.579
Okay.

24:22.284 --> 24:24.418
Um. Valentina Ivankova.

24:24.453 --> 24:25.852
She is reporter.

24:25.887 --> 24:28.021
Any reason
they're moving her?

24:28.057 --> 24:29.923
I don't know.

24:29.958 --> 24:31.858
What was Yuri's relationship
like with her?

24:31.893 --> 24:34.894
Did he seem to take any kind of
special interest in her

24:34.930 --> 24:36.328
in the last few months?

24:36.364 --> 24:37.729
Not really.

24:37.765 --> 24:39.798
She's the same with him
like with everyone.

24:41.369 --> 24:42.701
Okay. Great.

24:42.736 --> 24:45.471
That's all good.

24:45.506 --> 24:47.673
Just keep noticing stuff,
just like that.

24:47.708 --> 24:49.007
Okay.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.846
So, how's the little man?

24:57.551 --> 24:59.584
So good.

24:59.619 --> 25:01.686
No trouble with him.

25:01.721 --> 25:02.987
So sweet.

25:03.022 --> 25:04.689
And how about that guy?
Gennadi?

25:04.724 --> 25:06.023
Have you seen him again?

25:06.059 --> 25:07.692
Yes.

25:09.362 --> 25:12.262
I likes him. Even more.

25:12.298 --> 25:16.500
You know,
he was a very big hockey player,

25:16.535 --> 25:23.107
but he doesn't think
he's too... important.

25:25.311 --> 25:27.276
And he likes me too.

25:27.312 --> 25:28.411
Well, good.

25:28.446 --> 25:30.779
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

25:30.815 --> 25:32.115
But you know,

25:32.150 --> 25:34.617
you have to be careful
with him too.

25:34.652 --> 25:36.685
I know.

25:39.424 --> 25:41.157
Goodbye.

25:41.192 --> 25:42.625
Bye.

27:30.194 --> 27:31.927
Not one sound.

27:36.066 --> 27:38.701
I don't have
much money.

27:38.736 --> 27:40.736
You can have
what there is.

27:40.771 --> 27:42.804
In my purse.
In the kitchen.

27:45.275 --> 27:47.174
Take it.

27:47.210 --> 27:48.876
All of it.

27:48.911 --> 27:51.412
This isn't about money.

27:53.015 --> 27:54.249
What do you want?

27:54.284 --> 27:57.151
The truth.

27:57.186 --> 27:59.153
About what?

27:59.188 --> 28:01.888
Anna Mikhaylovna
Prokopchuk.

28:03.692 --> 28:05.425
- Who...?
- You tell us.

28:06.695 --> 28:08.729
I don't know.

28:08.764 --> 28:10.364
I don't know what to say.

28:10.399 --> 28:11.598
I don't know
who this person is.

28:11.634 --> 28:13.099
She's you.

28:13.135 --> 28:14.768
What?

28:14.803 --> 28:17.203
No. You have wrong person.

28:17.239 --> 28:18.804
My name is Natalie Granholm.

28:18.839 --> 28:21.807
I-I don't know this person--

28:21.842 --> 28:24.610
I never met this person,
I never heard this name before.

28:25.780 --> 28:26.879
I can show you.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.046
Mnh-mnh.

28:28.082 --> 28:30.483
It's in my pocketbook,
okay?

28:30.518 --> 28:32.885
My driver's license.
You can see for yourself.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.219
You-- You see
I'm not this Anna,

28:35.255 --> 28:37.756
I'm not this person,
whoever she is.

28:37.791 --> 28:40.458
Where were you born?

28:40.494 --> 28:41.493
Russia.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.230
You think
I knew this person from Russia?

28:46.266 --> 28:49.801
What can I say? Uh...

28:49.836 --> 28:51.802
I haven't lived there
for forty years.

28:51.837 --> 28:53.437
Where in Russia?

28:53.472 --> 28:55.038
Where "what?"

28:55.073 --> 28:57.140
Where are you from?

28:57.176 --> 28:58.309
Sevsk.

28:58.344 --> 28:59.743
You're lying.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.545
About what?

29:01.580 --> 29:03.714
Everything.

29:03.749 --> 29:05.215
I don't understand...

29:05.250 --> 29:07.584
Your life is a lie.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.786
Why are you saying
such things?

29:10.655 --> 29:12.054
I don't know
what you're talking about,

29:12.089 --> 29:13.956
who you're talking about...

29:13.991 --> 29:15.792
Who are you?

29:15.827 --> 29:18.260
You were born
in Dyatkovo.

29:18.296 --> 29:20.129
No, no.

29:20.164 --> 29:21.531
I was born in Sevsk.

29:21.566 --> 29:22.832
I've never been
to Dyatkovo.

29:22.867 --> 29:24.834
But you know it.

29:24.869 --> 29:27.469
It wasn't that far
from where I grew up.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.671
I-I never been in Dyatkovo.

29:29.707 --> 29:31.139
My name is
Natalie Granholm.

29:31.174 --> 29:33.174
I was...
I was Natalya Konina.

29:33.210 --> 29:34.275
You-- You mistaken.

29:34.311 --> 29:35.544
Please. I swear.

29:35.579 --> 29:37.212
I-I-I don't know.

29:37.247 --> 29:40.014
I don't know this person,
this Anna, whoever she is.

29:40.050 --> 29:41.282
Prokopchuk.

29:41.318 --> 29:45.285
Anna Mikhaylovna
Prokopchuk.

29:45.321 --> 29:46.787
Who is she?

29:46.823 --> 29:49.156
What did she do to you?

29:49.191 --> 29:52.292
You think she's me?

29:52.328 --> 29:53.828
No, you-- you--
you mistaken.

29:53.863 --> 29:55.229
I swear you mistaken.

29:55.264 --> 29:56.430
My name is Natalie Granholm.

29:56.466 --> 29:57.665
From Sevsk.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.032
I'm-- I-I-- It's not me.

30:00.068 --> 30:01.701
I swear it's not me.

30:01.737 --> 30:04.371
I am a wife, I'm a mother,
I'm a grandmother.

30:04.406 --> 30:06.773
I lived in this house
for twenty-five ye--

30:08.543 --> 30:09.942
You're a traitor!

30:09.978 --> 30:12.779
- You betrayed your own people!
- No. Never.

30:12.814 --> 30:14.914
You slaughtered
your own people.

30:14.949 --> 30:16.582
- That's not true--
- Young boys--

30:16.617 --> 30:17.883
- No.
- Soldiers--

30:17.918 --> 30:20.452
Brave men who were fighting,
unlike you--

30:20.488 --> 30:22.053
You took them
to the edge of town

30:22.089 --> 30:24.089
and you shot them
and you dumped them in a pit.

30:24.124 --> 30:27.158
- No, never, never. I--
- You did this over and over again, we know--

30:27.194 --> 30:29.728
You have the blood
of over a thousand soldiers

30:29.764 --> 30:30.962
- on your hands.
- No, no, no.

30:30.998 --> 30:32.831
I'm Natalya Konina.
From Sevsk.

30:32.867 --> 30:33.998
You know what you are?

30:34.033 --> 30:35.666
You're a monster.

30:36.503 --> 30:38.436
You want to know who we are?

30:39.191 --> 30:41.087
_

31:01.829 --> 31:02.861
You alright?

31:07.835 --> 31:09.033
Yeah.

31:10.804 --> 31:13.804
You believe her?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.513
She's lying.

31:24.517 --> 31:26.684
Even if it is her...

31:26.719 --> 31:28.352
What?

31:28.388 --> 31:30.319
You think she's changed?

31:59.283 --> 32:01.683
You're not
going to fool us.

32:01.719 --> 32:03.285
We know who you are,

32:03.320 --> 32:05.185
and we know
what you've done.

32:07.056 --> 32:08.689
What are you
going to do?

32:10.159 --> 32:11.492
Wait.

32:12.495 --> 32:13.861
For what?

32:13.897 --> 32:16.030
Your husband.

32:16.065 --> 32:18.032
He should be home soon.

32:18.067 --> 32:20.567
John? Why?

32:20.602 --> 32:22.969
You think he knows something
about this woman?

32:23.004 --> 32:24.404
He's never been
to Russia.

32:24.440 --> 32:28.508
He-- He cannot tell you
anything...

32:28.544 --> 32:30.844
He's a good man.

32:43.758 --> 32:45.891
It's all true,
what you said.

32:45.927 --> 32:48.627
I'm Anna Prokopchuk.

32:48.663 --> 32:50.228
From Dyatkovo.

32:50.264 --> 32:52.998
I betrayed my country.

32:53.033 --> 32:56.835
Yes, yes, yes.

32:56.870 --> 32:58.636
I betrayed my people.

32:58.672 --> 33:01.339
Friends, neighbors--
I killed them all.

33:01.374 --> 33:02.974
I deserve to die.

33:03.009 --> 33:04.709
You can kill me.

33:04.744 --> 33:07.712
John did nothing,
he knows nothing.

33:07.747 --> 33:09.581
Just kill me.

33:09.616 --> 33:10.982
Then go.

33:15.554 --> 33:16.920
Sit down.

33:20.893 --> 33:23.927
Tell us what you did.

33:23.963 --> 33:26.029
I killed people.

33:26.064 --> 33:27.397
Innocent people.

33:27.432 --> 33:28.598
Where?

33:28.633 --> 33:29.599
Dyatkovo.

33:29.634 --> 33:30.867
Why?

33:30.902 --> 33:32.434
I worked with
the Nazis.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.770
- Where?
- Where...?

33:34.806 --> 33:36.438
Where did you
murder them?

33:36.474 --> 33:37.439
In Dyatkovo.

33:37.475 --> 33:39.174
Where?

33:39.210 --> 33:41.544
Edge of-- Edge of the town,
like you said.

33:41.579 --> 33:42.678
Exactly where?

33:42.714 --> 33:44.279
What side of the town?

33:44.315 --> 33:46.214
I don't remember,

33:46.249 --> 33:48.082
it was far away,
long time ago,

33:48.118 --> 33:51.119
I... I can't remember.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.521
But I did it.

33:52.556 --> 33:53.889
I killed them all.

33:57.327 --> 33:59.260
No! Please!

33:59.295 --> 34:00.929
Don't hurt him.

34:00.964 --> 34:03.030
Please.

34:03.065 --> 34:04.765
He doesn't know.

34:06.301 --> 34:08.936
He thinks...

34:08.971 --> 34:11.103
I'm wonderful.

34:21.683 --> 34:23.016
If you scream,
you'll die here.

34:23.051 --> 34:24.817
Natalie--

34:28.657 --> 34:32.358
You want money?

34:32.393 --> 34:34.594
Here.

34:34.629 --> 34:36.429
Take it.

34:36.464 --> 34:38.295
There's more upstairs.

34:38.331 --> 34:40.264
They're not here
for money.

34:41.969 --> 34:44.202
What...

34:44.237 --> 34:46.071
What's going on?

34:48.876 --> 34:50.341
They're...

35:01.520 --> 35:04.655
When we met...

35:04.691 --> 35:06.724
after the War...

35:09.328 --> 35:11.360
They're here
because of the War.

35:14.132 --> 35:15.364
They want to know...

35:26.277 --> 35:28.043
Can I have some water?

35:55.038 --> 35:58.773
Natalie,
what's happening?

36:02.778 --> 36:04.511
Dyatkovo.

36:06.849 --> 36:08.581
I'm from Dyatkovo.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.620
You're from Sevsk.

36:22.730 --> 36:28.400
When the Nazi
overran Dyatkovo

36:28.435 --> 36:30.502
we were rounded up

36:30.538 --> 36:36.240
and taken to the square
in the center of town.

36:36.276 --> 36:38.476
My father was shot,

36:38.511 --> 36:43.848
along with many other men.
And boys.

36:43.884 --> 36:47.418
I held on to my mother.

36:47.453 --> 36:49.220
But she was shot.

36:55.427 --> 36:58.461
They made me dig a hole...

37:01.701 --> 37:07.237
I used a shovel, a pail,

37:07.272 --> 37:08.706
then my hands...

37:10.975 --> 37:13.475
we threw them in
like garbage.

37:16.547 --> 37:18.647
I was sixteen.

37:20.651 --> 37:24.020
I didn't know
anything about world.

37:24.055 --> 37:25.654
About anything.

37:29.126 --> 37:31.126
They let me live.

37:36.867 --> 37:38.100
Why?

37:44.140 --> 37:47.507
There was no reason.

37:47.543 --> 37:49.476
Nothing made any sense.

37:51.814 --> 37:54.148
They gave me food.

37:54.183 --> 37:56.550
I was obedient. Helpless.

38:00.189 --> 38:02.588
The first time,

38:02.624 --> 38:05.625
they gave me
so much to drink,

38:05.660 --> 38:07.660
I could barely stand up.

38:11.199 --> 38:12.832
The first time?

38:20.174 --> 38:22.040
That I shot them.

38:26.413 --> 38:28.446
Soviet prisoners.

38:35.721 --> 38:37.855
It wasn't me, in my body.

38:39.826 --> 38:41.525
It wasn't me.

38:44.597 --> 38:45.629
Natalie...

38:47.667 --> 38:50.501
I couldn't say,

38:50.536 --> 38:53.036
how could I say,
what could I say?

38:55.274 --> 39:00.010
I wanted to be
the person...

39:00.045 --> 39:03.213
The person you thought I was.

39:05.550 --> 39:08.918
I know who you are,
Natalie.

39:08.953 --> 39:10.552
I know you.

39:10.587 --> 39:13.856
You're... good.

39:18.796 --> 39:20.963
I'm sorry.

39:20.998 --> 39:22.631
I'm sorry.

39:27.971 --> 39:29.037
- Don't do this.
- Please.

39:29.072 --> 39:30.238
Please don't do this.
Don't.

39:30.273 --> 39:31.806
Please. If I could do...

39:31.842 --> 39:33.374
Please.

39:33.409 --> 39:35.076
Listen to-- to me. Wait. _

39:35.111 --> 39:36.277
Whatever happened
way back then--

39:36.313 --> 39:37.578
- No.
- Wait. Just wait.

39:37.613 --> 39:39.047
- No. Please.
- Look, it's--

39:39.082 --> 39:41.149
- It's not his fault.
- It's not her fault.

39:41.184 --> 39:42.550
You-- You heard
what they did to her.

39:42.585 --> 39:44.084
- You heard it.
- Please. Please.

39:44.119 --> 39:45.285
- You can't do this!
- No!

39:45.321 --> 39:46.253
- You can't do this!
- Please, no!

39:46.288 --> 39:47.187
You can't--

39:48.724 --> 39:50.324
My John!

39:50.625 --> 39:52.125
John!

41:00.058 --> 41:02.225
I want to
get out of here.

41:05.730 --> 41:07.630
We should just go.

41:12.869 --> 41:16.104
I mean it.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.407
Let's go home.

41:36.225 --> 41:39.961
Do you think that we could ever
take Paige and Henry... home?

41:39.963 --> 41:41.728
To live.

41:41.730 --> 41:43.663
Next time on The
Americans.

41:43.665 --> 41:46.499
Look, you can't predict what a
persons life will be.

41:46.758 --> 41:47.654
_

41:47.754 --> 41:48.653
_

41:48.654 --> 41:52.372
And you can't deny them the
challenges that will shape them.

41:52.374 --> 41:54.707
You're going to blow the whole
operation.

41:54.709 --> 41:56.709
I wish I could tell you what
you should do.

41:56.711 --> 41:58.945
We've been talking about
whether it's time...

41:58.947 --> 42:00.946
for us to end our tour here.

42:00.947 --> 42:04.847
The Americans, all-new next
Tuesday at 10 on FX.
