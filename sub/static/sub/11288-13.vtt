WEBVTT

00:04.070 --> 00:05.338
LET ME GUESS.

00:05.405 --> 00:08.341
YOU'RE ON CHAPTER ONE
OF THE HOW‐TO‐JUGGLE BOOK.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.611
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'M ON CHAPTER SIX.

00:10.677 --> 00:14.515
CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH FIVE WERE
"GETTING TO KNOW YOUR FINGERS."

00:15.816 --> 00:16.817
HEY, HEY.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.485
OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.388
OH, OBIE, WHAT HAPPENED?

00:22.455 --> 00:25.859
GIRL, THE VAN HIT A POTHOLE
THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.361
TOOK KYLE AND I
ABOUT AN HOUR

00:28.428 --> 00:30.964
TO GET IT OFF
TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

00:31.031 --> 00:35.536
AND KYLE WAS SO SHAKEN
HE HAD HIMSELF DRY‐CLEANED.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.871
WELL, SOMEONE HAD TO RISK
LIFE AND LIMB

00:37.938 --> 00:41.274
TO DIVERT
THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.709
WELL, HOW'S THE VAN?

00:42.776 --> 00:44.878
OH, GIRL, I'M AFRAID
THAT, UH...

00:44.945 --> 00:48.882
OLD VANTASIA'S REACHED
THE END OF HER ROAD.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.717
CAN'T DO NOTHING NOW

00:50.784 --> 00:52.719
BUT GO DOWN
TO THE POLICE AUCTION

00:52.786 --> 00:55.722
AND TRY TO FIND SOMETHING
DIRT‐CHEAP AND SERVICEABLE.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.057
( giggling )

00:57.123 --> 01:00.060
THAT'S WHERE KYLE
GOT HIS LAST CAR.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.603
OR WAS IT HIS LAST DATE?

01:04.638 --> 01:07.808
CURSE THE SCIENTIST
THAT THAWED YOU OUT.

01:10.911 --> 01:13.747
KYLE, WHY DON'T YOU COME DOWN
TO THE AUCTION WITH US?

01:13.814 --> 01:16.016
YOUR NEGOTIATING SKILLS
WILL COME IN HANDY

01:16.082 --> 01:17.684
AS WE HAGGLE
OVER THE HOOPTIES.

01:17.751 --> 01:22.689
OVERTON, ALTHOUGH I PRIDE MYSELF
ON MY ABILITY TO HOOPTIE‐HAGGLE

01:22.756 --> 01:25.759
I MUST SAY THAT IMPOUND AUCTIONS
AREN'T EXACTLY THE BARKER STYLE.

01:25.759 --> 01:28.762
I MUST SAY THAT IMPOUND AUCTIONS
AREN'T EXACTLY THE BARKER STYLE.

01:28.829 --> 01:30.931
THAT'S TOO BAD, 'CAUSE
ISN'T THE AUCTION

01:30.997 --> 01:32.933

( laughing )

02:10.776 --> 02:12.378
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:12.445 --> 02:15.381
PUTTING ALL THE PROSPECTS
I DATED LAST YEAR

02:15.448 --> 02:16.783
INTO TWO PILES.

02:19.285 --> 02:21.387
"GUYS WHO KILLED THEMSELVES"

AND "GUYS WHO RAN SCREAMING
INTO THE NIGHT"?

02:24.558 --> 02:28.294
WELL, AT LEAST
I CAN'T SEPARATE MY OLD DATES

02:28.361 --> 02:30.363
INTO "TOOTHLESS" AND "JOBLESS."

02:32.766 --> 02:35.736
THIS PILE... ARE LOSERS.

02:35.802 --> 02:38.404
THIS PILE: CUTE LOSERS.

02:38.471 --> 02:41.575
THIS PILE: POTENTIAL LIFEMATES.

02:41.642 --> 02:45.612
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

HENCE, MY FUNK.

02:48.481 --> 02:50.584
WHAT ABOUT
THAT COMPUTER PROGRAMMER

02:50.651 --> 02:52.252
YOU DATED LAST WEEK?

02:52.318 --> 02:54.955
HE E‐MAILED YOU A PICTURE
OF A DOZEN ROSES.

02:55.021 --> 02:56.957
AH, YES, DWIGHT

DOING TONIGHT?

03:04.170 --> 03:05.706
DO YOU WANT TO
GO TO A MOVIE?

03:05.772 --> 03:07.541
I PROMISE I WON'T
EVEN SHUSH YOU

03:07.608 --> 03:09.442
WHEN YOU TALK BACK
TO THE SCREEN.

03:09.510 --> 03:11.778
SORRY. I'M MEETING CHARLES
AT THE THEATER.

03:11.845 --> 03:12.979
OOH, THE THEATER.

03:13.046 --> 03:15.315
I CAN DO THE THEATER.
WHAT'S PLAYING?

03:15.381 --> 03:17.718
A DISEASED LUNG.
WE'RE WATCHING AN OPERATION

03:17.784 --> 03:20.353
AT THE SURGICAL THEATER
IN ST. VINCENT'S HOSPITAL.

03:20.420 --> 03:22.355
GOT TO GET THERE EARLY
FOR GREAT SEATS.

03:22.422 --> 03:25.325
YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE HEART
PUMPING FROM THE FRONT ROW.

03:27.794 --> 03:29.696
YOU KNOW,
I'D HANG WITH YOU, REGINE

03:29.763 --> 03:32.098
BUT HELL HASN'T
COMPLETELY FROZEN OVER YET.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.737
FRIENDS, AFRICANS,
COUNTRYMEN

03:36.803 --> 03:38.071
LEND ME YOUR EARS.

THE PROUD OWNERS

03:39.973 --> 03:42.075

LINCOLN CONTINENTAL.

03:42.142 --> 03:43.476
<i>YEAH.</i>

03:45.311 --> 03:48.915
OVERTON CAME PERILOUSLY CLOSE
TO PURCHASING A PANEL VAN

03:48.982 --> 03:52.052
WITH SHAG CARPET
AND A CHAIN‐LINK STEERING WHEEL.

03:52.118 --> 03:55.355
YEAH, AND THEN I SAW THE
TWINKLE IN MY BABY'S EYE

03:55.421 --> 03:57.691
WHEN SHE SAW
THAT CLASSY CHASSIS.

03:57.758 --> 03:59.192
SO FROM NOW ON

03:59.259 --> 04:02.603
ME AND GIRLY GOING

04:08.274 --> 04:10.711
MY EXQUISITE
NEW ALLIGATOR SHOES

04:10.777 --> 04:13.379
AND PICK UP
MY EQUALLY EXQUISITE DATE.

04:13.446 --> 04:16.048
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BUYING THOSE SHOES‐‐

04:16.116 --> 04:19.219
SEEING AS THEY WERE ONCE
A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY.

04:19.285 --> 04:21.988
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE OPTED
FOR SNAKESKIN

04:22.055 --> 04:24.725
BUT I CAN GET THAT FROM YOU
DURING MOLTING SEASON.

04:24.791 --> 04:26.793

04:28.328 --> 04:29.730
HEY, OBIE AND SYNCLAIRE

04:29.796 --> 04:31.932
I'D LOVE TO TAKE A SPIN

UH, WELL, UH...
I WAS PLANNING

04:35.468 --> 04:38.872
ON A MAGICAL EVENING
OF ROMANCE WITH MY BABY.

04:38.938 --> 04:42.475
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD JOG
ALONGSIDE THE CAR.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.745
NEVER MIND.

04:44.811 --> 04:46.747
I'LL JUST STAY AT HOME.

04:46.813 --> 04:48.081
ALONE.

04:48.148 --> 04:50.483
PONDERING THE MEANING
OF LOST FRIENDSHIP.

04:52.452 --> 04:53.887
COOL.
COOL.

04:56.089 --> 05:00.266

HEY, MA.

05:04.270 --> 05:08.374
WELL, GEE, AS TEMPTING
AS BOWLING WITH THE GIRLS SOUNDS

05:08.441 --> 05:10.711
NAH, I GOT PLANS FOR TONIGHT.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.045
( doorbell rings )

05:12.112 --> 05:13.880
OH, GEE, THERE'S
MY DATE NOW.

SATURDAY SHUT‐IN SPECIAL.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.400
NO.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.302
I DON'T CARE.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.207
( laughing )

05:41.274 --> 05:43.209
I DON'T KNOW, REGINE.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.546
THE PIZZA MAN'S GOT A STEADY JOB

05:45.612 --> 05:49.115
AND YOU DAMN SURE DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT WHISKER BURN.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.023
HEY, MOM.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.193
YEAH. UH...
MY DATE HAD TO CANCEL.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.705
YEAH. HE, UH,
HAD TO MAKE A DELIVERY.

06:04.771 --> 06:06.940
HE'S AN OBSTETRICIAN.

06:08.942 --> 06:12.045
SO, LISTEN, UM, HOW ABOUT
YOU AND ME GO TO DINNER TONIGHT

06:12.112 --> 06:14.214
AT THE FOUR ROSES, HUH?

06:15.448 --> 06:17.383
GREAT. COOL. OKAY.

06:17.450 --> 06:19.520
OH. UH, MOM, LISTEN, UM...

06:19.586 --> 06:21.522
THE FOUR ROSES
ISN'T A BUFFETERIA.

06:21.588 --> 06:23.657
YEAH. SO, UH, HOW ABOUT WE LEAVE

06:23.724 --> 06:25.792
THE SPANDEX CULOTTES
AT HOME, OKAY?

06:28.629 --> 06:30.230
SO, WHEN RITA TOLD ME

06:30.296 --> 06:32.966
THIS DWIGHT WAS A
COMPUTER PROGRAMMER

06:33.033 --> 06:34.467
I THOUGHT, "BABY

06:34.535 --> 06:38.605
THERE'S A LOT OF CHIPS
IN THEM CHIPS."

06:38.672 --> 06:40.741
BUT, MA, I WANT SOMEBODY

06:40.807 --> 06:42.943
WHO'S MORE INTO ME
THAN HIS MOTHER.

06:43.009 --> 06:45.579
I WANT SOMEBODY
WHOSE FACE JUST LIGHTS UP

06:45.646 --> 06:47.213
WHEN I WALK INTO A ROOM.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.082
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED

06:49.149 --> 06:50.450
A GOLDEN RETRIEVER.

06:50.517 --> 06:52.853
BABY, IF YOU WANT TO LAND
THE PERFECT MAN

06:52.919 --> 06:54.588
THAN YOU COULD START BY ADDING

06:54.655 --> 06:57.591
A LITTLE FLASH AND DAZZLE
TO YOUR WARDROBE.

06:57.658 --> 06:59.025
EXCUSE ME, MADAM.

06:59.092 --> 07:01.027
COULD YOU MOVE
A LITTLE TO THE LEFT?

07:01.094 --> 07:04.404
YOUR HEADGEAR IS BLINDING
THE COUPLE AT THE NEXT TABLE.

07:10.777 --> 07:13.614
HEY, UH...
HOW ABOUT WE ORDER, HUH?

07:15.115 --> 07:17.050

08:19.820 --> 08:21.722
OH... OH...

08:21.788 --> 08:24.190
WELL, OH,
REGINE'S NOT MY SISTER.

08:24.257 --> 08:26.259
OH, SHE'S MY DAUGHTER.

08:27.427 --> 08:30.096
GOD, I HAD HER WHEN
I WAS... WHAT? TEN?

08:32.866 --> 08:35.068
I WOULD HAVE GUESSED EIGHT.

08:35.135 --> 08:37.571
( both laughing )

08:37.638 --> 08:39.940
HARRISON, I'M SORRY

08:40.006 --> 08:41.575
BUT I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO HAVE A PLEASANT DINNER.

08:41.642 --> 08:42.842
I JUST CAME

08:42.909 --> 08:44.578
TO BE WITH REGINE.

08:46.813 --> 08:49.616
I, UH... TELL YOU WHAT,
WHY DON'T YOU TWO KIDS

08:49.683 --> 08:51.818
JUST, UH, CARRY ON
WITHOUT ME, HUH?

08:51.885 --> 08:52.919
OH.

08:52.986 --> 08:54.254
REGINE...

08:55.255 --> 08:56.590
ARE YOU SURE?

09:03.436 --> 09:05.105
I INSIST.

09:06.773 --> 09:09.375
OH, WHAT AN
AMAZING EVENING.

09:09.442 --> 09:11.678
EVERYWHERE WE WENT
IN THAT CAR

09:11.745 --> 09:13.013
PEOPLE JUST STARED.

09:13.079 --> 09:15.015
THAT'S CAUSE YOU SPENT
THE WHOLE TIME

09:15.081 --> 09:17.651
YELLING OUT THE WINDOW,
"HEY, EVERYBODY, LOOK AT US.

09:17.718 --> 09:19.653
WE GOT OURSELVES
A STINKING LINCOLN."

09:19.720 --> 09:22.055
HEY, OVERTON.

09:22.122 --> 09:24.591
YOU'RE PRETTY BOLD
TO BE DRIVING AROUND

09:24.658 --> 09:27.293
IN A SEDAN THAT ONCE
BELONGED TO THE MOB.

09:28.795 --> 09:31.532
WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT,
MAX?

09:31.598 --> 09:33.233
THAT CAR'S LAST OWNER

09:33.299 --> 09:35.736
WAS A SMALL‐TIME HOOD
NAMED JOHNNY FATS.

09:35.802 --> 09:38.104
HE WAS STABBED,
STRANGLED, RUN OVER

09:38.171 --> 09:41.041
AND STUFFED IN THE TRUNK‐‐
NOT IN THAT ORDER.

09:41.107 --> 09:43.644
UM, THAT CAR WAS A
KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.212
YOU KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT'S THE CAR?

09:46.279 --> 09:48.749
WELL, IF YOU LOOK REAL
CLOSELY AT THE GRILL

09:48.815 --> 09:51.752
YOU'LL SEE A DENT IN
THE SHAPE OF A MAN'S FACE

09:51.818 --> 09:54.020
SCREAMING FOR HIS LIFE.

09:56.957 --> 09:58.091
ENJOY.

09:59.593 --> 10:03.203
OBIE, I CANNOT RIDE IN
A CAR THAT WHACKED FATS.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.071
AW, GIRLY, COME ON.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.573
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE
THAT CAR.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.576
AND WHEN WE HAVE OUR BABY,
LITTLE SYNCLOVERTON

10:09.643 --> 10:11.377
HE OR SHE WILL LOVE IT TOO.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.379
I MEAN, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.681
JUST SELL IT?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.049
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.383
BUT FIRST PEEL OFF

10:17.450 --> 10:19.586
MY "I BRAKE FOR TROLLS"
BUMPER STICKER.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.125
HEY.

10:25.191 --> 10:25.926
HEY.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.060
SO, HOW'S THE ROMANCE

10:27.127 --> 10:28.995
BETWEEN MOMMY
AND THE MILLIONAIRE?

10:29.062 --> 10:33.834
DID HE BUY HER A NECKLACE,
A BRACELET, NEW JERSEY?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.669
NOW, HOW THE HELL WOULD I KNOW

10:35.736 --> 10:38.404
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH MY MOM AND, UH, <i>HARRISON?</i>

10:38.471 --> 10:40.306
SHE HASN'T CALLED ME IN A WEEK.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.642
( doorbell rings )

10:41.708 --> 10:42.809
I'LL GET IT.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.478
( gasps )

10:49.816 --> 10:54.855
OH, LORD, WE GOT TO GET
CALLER I. D. FOR THE DOOR.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.524
FABULOUS,
MOTHER HUNTER.

10:57.591 --> 11:00.360
YOU'RE LIKE A MOVIE STAR,
ONLY BRIGHTER.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.703
HARRISON'S TAKING ME
TO THE OPERA TONIGHT.

11:02.769 --> 11:05.271
HONEY, YOU GOT ANYTHING
THAT'LL GO WITH THIS?

11:05.338 --> 11:08.408
COUPLE OF BENGAL TIGERS
AND A WHIP.

11:08.474 --> 11:09.710
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:09.776 --> 11:12.112
MY CLOWN GLOVES MIGHT WORK.
JUST BE CAREFUL.

11:12.178 --> 11:15.749
DON'T PRESS ON THE THUMB
OR ELSE YOUR SHOES WILL EXPLODE.

11:15.816 --> 11:17.017
I'LL GO GET THEM.

11:17.083 --> 11:21.387
OH, KHADIJAH‐BOO,
HARRISON IS SUCH A GOOD MAN.

11:21.454 --> 11:22.723
HE'S...

11:22.789 --> 11:25.225
OH, HE'S DECENT,
GENEROUS AND SO WITTY.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.460
HMM. JUST THE KIND OF MAN

11:27.528 --> 11:29.029
YOU'D WANT TO BRING
HOME TO DAUGHTER.

11:31.031 --> 11:34.067
OOH, AND, GIRL,
WHEN MY MAN TAKES OFF HIS SHIRT

11:34.134 --> 11:35.401
MMM... BULL‐YA!

11:35.468 --> 11:36.737
NOTHING BUT MUSCLE.

11:36.803 --> 11:37.938
NO, GIRL.

11:38.004 --> 11:40.741
GOING OUT WITH SOMEBODY
A COUPLE OF TIMES

11:40.807 --> 11:42.375
DON'T MAKE HIM YOUR MAN.

11:42.442 --> 11:48.414
WELL, I'VE BEEN OUT WITH HIM
12 TIMES IN TEN DAYS.

11:48.481 --> 11:51.818
WHAT DOES THAT
MAKE HIM, REGINE?

11:51.885 --> 11:54.487
A PEST.

11:54.555 --> 11:56.022
WELL, I HAVE A FEELING

11:56.089 --> 11:58.792
THIS PEST MAY BE AROUND
A LONG TIME.

11:58.859 --> 12:00.500
OOH, I WONDER

12:00.567 --> 12:02.035
IF HARRISON COULD ASK

12:02.102 --> 12:03.970
BO DIDDLEY TO SING
AT THE WEDDING.

12:04.037 --> 12:07.273
I GUESS ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE...
IN YOUR WORLD.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.545
HEY, YOU BETTER WATCH
YOUR TONE, REGINA.

12:11.612 --> 12:14.214
MOM, I KNOW YOU'RE TAKEN
BY HIM, ALL RIGHT?

12:14.280 --> 12:17.183
BUT... CUSHMORE IS WAY OUT
OF YOUR BOWLING LEAGUE.

12:19.252 --> 12:23.023
ONCE THE NOVELTY OF
YOUR JERSEY GIRL CHARM WEARS OFF

12:23.089 --> 12:24.357
HE'LL BE GONE.

12:24.424 --> 12:25.892
REGINE.

12:25.959 --> 12:28.328
YOU'D THINK

12:28.394 --> 12:32.065
THAT WHEN SOMETHING GOOD
FINALLY HAPPENS IN MY LIFE

12:32.132 --> 12:34.801
MY OWN DAUGHTER
WOULD BE HAPPY FOR ME.

12:43.644 --> 12:46.412
YOU KNOW, IF THERE
IS ONE THING I CANNOT STAND

12:46.479 --> 12:48.314
IS A MELODRAMATIC EXIT.

12:50.316 --> 12:53.987
I MEAN, I GIVE AND I GIVE

12:54.054 --> 12:56.523
AND WHAT DO I GET BACK
BUT PAIN!

13:02.769 --> 13:06.106
( English accent ):
SMASHING PERFORMANCE
ON BOTH SIDES.

13:11.177 --> 13:14.781
OH, SO, DID YOU SELL
THE DEATH MOBILE YET?

13:14.848 --> 13:16.282
NO.

13:16.349 --> 13:18.885
WHEN THE GUY ASKED
ABOUT TRUNK CAPACITY

13:18.952 --> 13:21.387
ONE OF US SAID
THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM

13:21.454 --> 13:23.657
FOR A BODY
AND A BASEBALL BAT.

13:23.724 --> 13:25.391
PEOPLE HAVE
A RIGHT TO KNOW

13:25.458 --> 13:27.193
ABOUT A CAR'S
PREVIOUS OWNER.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.662
WOULD YOU BUY A FRIDGE

13:28.729 --> 13:31.397
IF YOU KNEW IT BELONGED
TO JEFFREY DAHMER?

13:32.699 --> 13:33.834
YOU KNOW, LOVE BUG

13:33.900 --> 13:36.036
WE WOULDN'T BE STUCK
WITH THIS CAR

13:36.102 --> 13:38.238
IF THE FIRST TIME
YOU SAW IT

13:38.304 --> 13:40.173
YOU HADN'T SAID,
"OH, LOOK, A LINCOLN.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.909
JUST LIKE MY FAVORITE
CITY IN NEBRASKA."

13:42.976 --> 13:44.845
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO SAID THAT

13:44.911 --> 13:46.980
THE POWER SEAT
MADE YOU FEEL LIKE

13:47.047 --> 13:49.449
EMPEROR OF ALL HANDYMEN!

13:49.516 --> 13:52.218
MUST I YET AGAIN STEP
INTO THE FRAY

13:52.285 --> 13:54.788
AND DOUSE THE FIRES
OF ANTIPATHY?

13:54.855 --> 13:56.422
HUH?

13:56.489 --> 13:57.791
WHOO, WHOO, WHOO.

13:57.858 --> 13:59.459
WELL...

13:59.526 --> 14:00.801
COME ON.

14:00.867 --> 14:02.969
I'M SORRY,
MY WIFE‐IN‐WAITING.

14:03.036 --> 14:05.305
I'M SORRY TOO,
MY GONNA‐BE‐GROOM.

14:05.371 --> 14:06.306
SEE YOU LATER.

14:06.372 --> 14:07.307
BYE.

14:07.373 --> 14:08.642
YOU KNOW, OVERTON

14:08.709 --> 14:10.243
THEY SAY A CAR
IS STOLEN

14:10.310 --> 14:12.178
EVERY 15 MINUTES
IN THE CITY.

14:12.245 --> 14:14.014
HERE.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.081
WHAT SINISTER PLAN

14:15.148 --> 14:16.850
IS THAT EGGHEAD
OF YOURS HATCHING?

14:16.917 --> 14:19.285
SIMPLY PARK YOUR VEHICLE
AND FORGET TO LOCK IT.

14:19.352 --> 14:22.222
IF IT IS THERE IN THE MORNING,
YOU WERE MEANT TO KEEP IT.

14:22.288 --> 14:25.225
IF IT IS NOT, YOU ARE MEANT
TO CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.227
YOU KNOW, KYLE, YOU GOT A GIFT

14:27.293 --> 14:30.964
FOR MAKING SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
SHADY SEEM... ALMOST NOBLE.

14:31.031 --> 14:33.466
OVERTON, I AM
A STOCKBROKER.

14:33.534 --> 14:34.467
COME ON.

14:34.535 --> 14:36.236
( chuckles )

14:36.302 --> 14:38.639
( in singsong ):
EXTRA! EXTRA!

14:39.540 --> 14:41.875
LOOK WHOSE MAMA
MADE THE SOCIETY PAGE

14:41.942 --> 14:43.610
WEARING PLAID GAUCHOS.

14:48.114 --> 14:52.953
HOW DID SHE GET HARRISON
TO GO TO WRESTLEMANIA IV?

14:53.019 --> 14:56.422
OH, YOU COULD TAKE A LESSON
FROM YOUR MOM

14:56.489 --> 14:58.625
ON HOW TO SNAG MR. RIGHT.

14:58.692 --> 15:01.201
THE DAY I NEED LESSONS
FROM MY MOTHER

15:01.267 --> 15:03.970
IS THE DAY I DANCE NAKED
IN TIMES SQUARE

15:04.037 --> 15:05.972
SINGING "DISCO INFERNO."

15:07.574 --> 15:09.309
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DANCE NAKED

15:09.375 --> 15:10.977
STAY AWAY FROM TIMES SQUARE.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.913
YOU'LL SCARE THE PIGEONS.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.217
I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR YOU.

15:17.283 --> 15:20.153
I'M GOING TO TREAT
MYSELF TO DINNER

15:20.220 --> 15:21.855
AT THE FOUR ROSES.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.591
IT IS TRES CHIC
TO DINE ALONE.

15:24.658 --> 15:28.662
AU CONTRAIRE, MA
PETITE LEPRECHAUN.

15:28.729 --> 15:30.731
"TRES CHIC" MEANS "STYLISH."

15:30.797 --> 15:33.366
THE WORD YOU WANT
IS "PATHETIQUE."

15:47.914 --> 15:49.850
( laughing )

15:49.916 --> 15:52.953
HEY, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU TORCH
THE TABLE

15:53.019 --> 15:54.788
YOU MIGHT MEET
A NICE FIREMAN.

15:54.855 --> 15:57.157
I'M NOT HERE TO MEET
ANYBODY, ALL RIGHT?

15:57.223 --> 15:59.159
AND IF YOU'RE HERE
TO LECTURE ME

15:59.225 --> 16:00.160
MAKE IT QUICK.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.168
HARRISON DUMPED YOUR MOTHER.

16:02.235 --> 16:03.369
PASS THE BUTTER.

16:03.436 --> 16:04.838
WHAT?!

16:04.905 --> 16:06.172
YEP. MY MOM CALLED.

16:06.239 --> 16:09.175
HARRISON BROKE IT OFF,
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

16:09.242 --> 16:10.844
BROCCOLI!

16:10.911 --> 16:13.013
HMM, POOR MOM.

16:13.079 --> 16:14.815
AND WHY WAS I JUST BORN

16:14.881 --> 16:17.651
WITH THIS CURSE
OF ALWAYS BEING RIGHT?

16:17.718 --> 16:19.686
IF YOU WANT TO DO
THE RIGHT THING NOW

16:19.753 --> 16:21.722
YOUR MOTHER COULD USE
SOME COMFORTING.

16:21.788 --> 16:23.724
OOH, SAUCE.

16:23.790 --> 16:25.726
YEAH, I GUESS.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.929
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S
ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME.

16:28.995 --> 16:30.897
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:30.964 --> 16:33.033
I'M GOING TO LAY OFF THAT SAUCE

16:33.099 --> 16:35.035
'CAUSE THIS GOT YOU TRIPPING.

16:35.101 --> 16:36.336
UH‐UH. COME ON, KHADIJAH.

16:36.402 --> 16:38.572
THE OTHER NIGHT
WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME

16:38.639 --> 16:39.773
MY MOTHER DITCHED ME.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.175
HOW ABOUT ALL OF THOSE TIMES
AFTER SCHOOL

16:42.242 --> 16:44.210
AND I HAD TO COME OVER
TO YOUR HOUSE

16:44.277 --> 16:47.247
AND SUFFER THROUGH YOUR MOTHER'S
MEAT LOAF SURPRISE?

16:47.313 --> 16:49.750
FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS CHILI.

16:52.218 --> 16:54.487
AND THE ONLY REASON
YOU WERE AT OUR HOUSE

16:54.555 --> 16:56.657
IS BECAUSE YOUR MOM
TOOK A SECOND JOB

16:56.723 --> 17:00.100
JUST SO SHE COULD BUY YOU
THAT JUNIOR WIG TRAVEL CASE.

17:01.167 --> 17:03.904
OKAY. WELL, HOW ABOUT
ALL THOSE COLD MORNINGS

17:03.970 --> 17:06.071
THAT I HAD TO WALK TO YOUR HOUSE

17:06.138 --> 17:08.775
SO THAT YOUR MOM COULD
DRIVE US TO SCHOOL?

17:08.842 --> 17:11.444
OKAY. SO, WHAT ABOUT
WHEN SHE SOLD THE CAR

17:11.512 --> 17:14.580
JUST SO SHE COULD GET YOU
BRACES, SCHOOL SUPPLIES

17:14.647 --> 17:16.249
AND ROLLER DISCO LESSONS?

17:16.316 --> 17:17.651
♪ WHOO‐WHOO! ♪

17:19.285 --> 17:24.057
IS THIS AN INCREDIBLY
LONG WAY OF SAYING...

17:24.124 --> 17:25.858
I'M PETTY, SELFISH

17:25.925 --> 17:28.194
AND SHOULD APOLOGIZE
TO MY MOTHER?

17:28.261 --> 17:31.031
I WAS GOING TO SAY
"OBNOXIOUS AND UNGRATEFUL"

17:31.097 --> 17:32.833
BUT YOUR LIFE, YOUR WORDS.

17:37.070 --> 17:38.338
SO, WHAT'S UP?

17:38.404 --> 17:39.673
ANY LUCK, MAN?

17:39.740 --> 17:43.009
FOUR DAYS AND OLD
MR. LINCOLN'S STILL THERE.

17:43.076 --> 17:44.945
DAMN NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

17:45.011 --> 17:46.212
CAN WE HELP YOU?

17:46.279 --> 17:48.281
CAN ONE OF YOU
FINE GENTLEMEN

17:48.348 --> 17:51.417
TELL ME WHERE I MIGHT FIND
OVERTON JONES?

17:54.521 --> 17:56.456
UM... I'M
OVERTON JONES.

17:56.523 --> 17:57.958
CRAZY JOEY.

17:58.024 --> 17:59.560
JOHNNY FATS' NEPHEW.

17:59.626 --> 18:03.737
I'M PREPARED
TO OFFER YOU A GENEROUS SUM

18:03.804 --> 18:06.239
TO TAKE THAT LINCOLN
OFF YOUR HANDS.

18:06.306 --> 18:09.409
DO TELL, CRAZY.

18:09.475 --> 18:11.845
THERE IS ONE PROVISO:

18:11.912 --> 18:15.549
YOU MUST HELP ME
CARRY OUT MY UNCLE'S WISHES

18:15.616 --> 18:17.217
TO BE BURIED IN THE CAR.

18:17.283 --> 18:18.985
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:19.052 --> 18:21.354
YOU WANT US
TO GET YOUR DEAD UNCLE

18:21.421 --> 18:23.657
PUT HIM IN THE BACK
OF MY LINCOLN

18:23.724 --> 18:25.526
AND BURY THE WHOLE SHEBANG?

18:25.592 --> 18:28.261
OH, AFTER WE DIG HIM UP,
OF COURSE.

18:28.328 --> 18:31.565
OKAY. SO, WHAT
IF WE SAY NO?

18:31.632 --> 18:32.899
I DON'T KNOW.

18:32.966 --> 18:35.268
NO ONE'S EVER SAID NO
TO ME BEFORE.

18:35.335 --> 18:37.604
I'D HAVE TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

18:37.671 --> 18:38.805
I KNOW‐‐

18:38.872 --> 18:41.407
I'LL TELL MY OTHER
UNCLE BENNY THE HOOK.

18:41.474 --> 18:43.209
HE'S VERY CREATIVE.

18:44.244 --> 18:45.779
UH... UH...

18:45.846 --> 18:48.114
WHY DON'T WE JUST
FIND SOME SHOVELS?

18:48.181 --> 18:50.183
YOU KNOW,
THAT HOOK THING, MAN...

18:53.486 --> 18:54.588
YES!

18:54.655 --> 18:56.056
( laughing )

18:56.122 --> 18:57.057
HEY.

18:57.123 --> 18:58.725
NE‐NE! WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN?

18:58.792 --> 19:02.836
WE MISS THAT PRETTY LITTLE FACE
AND THAT SNOOTY LITTLE ATTITUDE.

19:02.903 --> 19:05.506
YES, REALLY GREAT
TO SEE ALL OF YOU TOO.

19:05.572 --> 19:06.940
WE MUST GET TOGETHER

19:07.007 --> 19:09.475
AT THE NEXT PORK RIND
EATING CONTEST.

19:09.543 --> 19:11.612
EXCUSE ME. I GOT
TO TALK TO MOM.

19:11.678 --> 19:13.947
NOT NOW, REGINE.
I'M BOWLING.

19:14.014 --> 19:16.449
NO, MOM, YOU ARE NOT
BOWLING, ALL RIGHT?

19:16.517 --> 19:18.652
YOU ARE TRYING
TO DROWN YOUR PAIN

19:18.719 --> 19:20.320
IN BLUE‐COLLAR ACTIVITY.

19:24.357 --> 19:26.326
LET'S PUT DOWN THE BALL.

19:26.392 --> 19:29.295
MOMMY, I'M HERE
TO HELP YOU.

19:29.362 --> 19:30.731
YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

19:30.797 --> 19:32.298
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

19:38.739 --> 19:40.006
YES!

19:40.073 --> 19:41.908
WHOO, WHOO,
WHOO, WHOO...

19:43.143 --> 19:44.611
WHOO‐WHOO, HEY!

19:46.146 --> 19:48.414
I‐I CANNOT COMPREHEND THIS.

19:48.481 --> 19:49.583
YOU...

19:49.650 --> 19:52.218
YOU JUST GOT DUMPED,
AND YOU SEEM OKAY.

19:52.285 --> 19:54.354
HOW DO YOU
BOUNCE BACK SO FAST

19:54.420 --> 19:57.023
AND WHY DIDN'T I
INHERIT THAT ABILITY?

19:57.090 --> 19:58.525
( chuckles )

19:58.592 --> 20:01.134
BABY GIRL,
IT'S JUST A MAN.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.637
GIRL, I HAD ONE
IN THE '70s...

20:03.704 --> 20:05.471
ONE IN THE '80s...

20:05.539 --> 20:08.942
NOW I DONE HAVE ONE
IN THE '90s.

20:09.009 --> 20:11.477
I GUESS YOU COULD
JUST TAKE THE REST

20:11.545 --> 20:13.046
OF THE DECADE OFF, HUH?

20:13.113 --> 20:15.381
YOU KNOW, REGINE,
I THINK IT'S GREAT

20:15.448 --> 20:18.752
THAT YOU'RE SO DETERMINED
TO FIND A RELATIONSHIP

20:18.819 --> 20:20.621
BUT DON'T SWEAT
THE BREAKUP.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.222
SHOOT, IT'S THEIR LOSS.

20:23.557 --> 20:24.991
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:25.058 --> 20:28.695
HEY, THIS ONE WAS
DEFINITELY HARRISON'S LOSS.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.798
WELL, COME ON, NE‐NE.

20:31.865 --> 20:33.967
BREAK SOME DINOSAUR TEETH.

20:34.034 --> 20:36.302
YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.939
YOU GOT SOMETHING
BETTER TO DO?

20:42.375 --> 20:43.744
( whispers ):
REGINE...

20:43.810 --> 20:44.911
WHAT?

20:44.978 --> 20:49.349
I THINK YOU HAVE
AN ADMIRER OVER THERE.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.518
EVENING, PROFESSOR JACKSON.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.054
POOR MAN.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.557
ALL THAT GORGEOUS
BRAIN POWER...

20:56.623 --> 20:59.025
AND HIM ALL ALONE
IN THE WORLD.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.043
( giggles )

21:10.110 --> 21:11.778
CLUMSY ME.

21:12.779 --> 21:14.280
OH, PROFESSOR...

21:15.381 --> 21:17.383
AH, SOOKIE,
SOOKIE NOW!

21:21.487 --> 21:22.889
