WEBVTT

00:03.123 --> 00:06.421
How serious?
If the swelling gets worse, it could inhibit her breathing.

00:06.421 --> 00:09.780
I told you to notify me, if there was any trouble.
Now, you say this has been going on for days?

00:09.780 --> 00:12.493
Well, the monitoring equipment didn't detect
the symptoms until this morning.

00:12.493 --> 00:15.312
It isn't calibrated
for this type of patient.

00:18.923 --> 00:19.723
Well?

00:20.268 --> 00:23.118
The fever's diminished.
She's fighting it off.

00:23.165 --> 00:25.515
That's good news...
for both of you.

00:28.626 --> 00:33.576
Intravascular pressure has stabilized.
Blood oxygenation is good. She looks so innocent.

00:34.825 --> 00:37.925
It's almost possible to forget
what she represents.

00:40.429 --> 00:42.429
We don't want to disturb her.

00:44.829 --> 00:45.529
No.

01:07.457 --> 01:09.444

02:20.368 --> 02:23.407
Captain's Starlog, January 19, 2155.

02:24.394 --> 02:29.594
Enterprise has been called home for what could prove
to be a pivotal moment in human history.

02:29.624 --> 02:32.174
Having endured a catastrophic World War,

02:32.946 --> 02:35.346
Earth's governments came
to this city

02:35.866 --> 02:39.424
for the purpose of creating
a just and lasting peace

02:39.806 --> 02:41.056
among nations.

02:41.615 --> 02:45.765
Today, we have assembled here again,
representatives of numerous worlds,

02:46.368 --> 02:48.892
to forge an unprecedented alliance.

02:49.450 --> 02:54.641
With this "Coalition of Planets", we seek
to strengthen our bonds of friendship,

02:55.096 --> 02:58.196
render permanent the peace
that now exists among us

02:58.293 --> 03:00.943
for the ongoing exploration
of our galaxy.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.498
Let us dedicate ourselves
to these worthy goals

03:04.615 --> 03:06.465
so that future generations

03:06.886 --> 03:09.486
can look back upon this moment
with pride

03:09.872 --> 03:11.522
and eternal gratitude.

03:11.723 --> 03:12.773
Thank you.

03:18.352 --> 03:19.902
People are watching.

03:20.615 --> 03:22.865
Nobody knows that better than him.

03:23.177 --> 03:25.177
Clap louder.
That's an order.

03:31.767 --> 03:34.067
Ah! I thought it was a fine speech.

03:34.354 --> 03:36.154
Just missing a few names.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.740
You'd think this was all his idea.
It's not about who gets credit.

03:39.740 --> 03:41.734
He could've at least mentioned Enterprise.

03:41.766 --> 03:44.231
Who does he think got the Andorians
and Tellarites talking?

03:44.231 --> 03:47.254
I'm sure history will reflect
our contribution.

03:48.076 --> 03:50.526
Not if he's writing it.
That's enough.

03:56.085 --> 03:58.735
I hope I didn't embarrass myself
too much.

03:59.086 --> 04:00.736
Far from it, Minister.

04:00.825 --> 04:02.125
Call me Nathan.

04:03.220 --> 04:07.852
I want to thank you again for attending.
Having Enterprise here seems to put evyone at ease.

04:07.852 --> 04:10.902
People feel comfortable
in the presence of heroes.

04:11.085 --> 04:15.517
Whatever we can do to help. Well, it certainly helps
that the delegates can understand each other.

04:15.517 --> 04:19.668
These universal translators work perfectly...
thanks to you.

04:20.170 --> 04:23.120
I just updated them with a few things
we picked up on the mission.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.363
Whatever you did,
they're extremely precise.

04:25.409 --> 04:30.788
Though when I'm listening to the Tellarite ambassador,
I wish they were just a little less precise.

04:30.788 --> 04:32.838
You've set a formidable goal--

04:32.872 --> 04:35.372
the drafting of a charter
in six weeks.

04:35.402 --> 04:39.452
I've always believed that formidable goals
produce formidable results.

04:46.094 --> 04:47.944
I decided to stop waiting.

04:49.024 --> 04:50.024
For what?

04:50.138 --> 04:52.238
You to come over and say hello.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.409
You were busy working.

04:55.010 --> 04:58.310
We never had a problem mixing work and pleasure.
Smile.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.234
I never could get you
to smile for the camera.

05:04.427 --> 05:06.277
How have you been, Gannet?

05:06.707 --> 05:11.186
Busy. There haven't been many
slow news days since the Xindi attack.

05:12.307 --> 05:17.307
I hear you're gonna be in the neighborhood awhile.
At least until the conference is over.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.183
We should get together.

05:20.747 --> 05:24.789
If we wait another four years,
we're going to have too much catching up to do.

05:24.789 --> 05:26.439
Can't argue with that.

05:27.764 --> 05:30.414
I'll pretend that was
an enthusiastic yes.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.907
Back to work.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.164
Commander Tucker does have a point.

05:45.972 --> 05:48.822
Enterprise laid the foundation
for this event.

05:49.228 --> 05:51.947
Perhaps it should be you
they're photographing.

05:51.947 --> 05:54.984
Samuels likes the spotlight,
and he's welcome to it.

05:59.168 --> 06:01.018
They're going to kill her.

06:01.322 --> 06:02.372
Excuse me?

06:02.726 --> 06:04.079
Don't let them.

06:10.038 --> 06:11.188
I-I'm sorry.

06:12.470 --> 06:16.420
It's a phase-pistol wound. She's going
into shock. Get me a med kit!

06:27.279 --> 06:28.529
[door opens]

06:29.626 --> 06:34.676
I just received word from Starfleet Medical.
The wound was too severe. She didn't survive.

06:36.323 --> 06:41.223
Do they think it could have been self-inflied?
They didn't say. Do we know who she was?

06:41.504 --> 06:43.354
Her name was Susan Khouri.

06:43.658 --> 06:47.758
She was a medical technician.
She'd been having some emotional trouble.

06:48.037 --> 06:52.287
Took a leave from work over a year ago.
Any idea who the hair belonged to?

06:52.659 --> 06:54.409
I have a very good idea.

06:55.684 --> 06:58.634
It was from a child
no more than six months old.

06:58.935 --> 07:03.835
I used every DNA identification protocol I'm aware of.
I even used a Klingon procedure.

07:03.971 --> 07:04.971
Go ahead.

07:06.038 --> 07:08.489
It contains Vulcan and human DNA.

07:09.576 --> 07:12.651
I had the computer search for any matches
in the Starfleet databank.

07:12.651 --> 07:15.560
When I got the results,
I ran the search three more times

07:15.583 --> 07:17.333
just to be certain.
And?

07:20.492 --> 07:25.976
According to every analysis, this child is
the offspring of Commander Tucker and Commander T'Pol.

07:32.412 --> 07:34.162
[door chimes]
Come in.

07:36.084 --> 07:37.934
We got to talk about this.

07:42.916 --> 07:46.912
It's difficult to talk about something that doesn't make sense.
Phlox said DNA doesn't lie.

07:46.912 --> 07:48.112
Neither do I.

07:48.377 --> 07:51.677
I've never been pregnant, Trip.
Then how do you explain

07:51.782 --> 07:52.782
all this?

07:54.390 --> 07:55.340
I can't.

08:00.279 --> 08:01.729
Do you believe me?

08:06.766 --> 08:07.566
Yeah.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.543
Phlox must be wrong.
That's all there is to it.

08:12.543 --> 08:16.576
If you've never been pregnant,
then you can't have a baby.

08:20.337 --> 08:25.028
Trip, the moment Phlox said
that the child was ours,

08:25.376 --> 08:28.976
I knew it was true. But you said
yod never been... I haven't.

08:29.681 --> 08:33.804
Then what are you saying?
I can't explain how it exists, but I know it does.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.405
There's a child out there,
and it's ours.

08:36.663 --> 08:38.863
How do you know that?
I'm Vulcan.

08:41.409 --> 08:44.859
Fortunately, the news hasn't spread
to the general public,

08:45.024 --> 08:46.711
and I'd like to keep it that way.

08:46.711 --> 08:51.041
If we made an announcement,
someone might come forward with information.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.881
An announcement of this nature
could derail the conference. How?

08:56.186 --> 08:58.936
You haven't spent
much time on Earth lately.

08:59.693 --> 09:04.241
After the Xindi attack,
there was a dangerous increase in xenophobia.

09:05.049 --> 09:08.600
We got a taste of it.
It died down somewhat, but not completely.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.493
There are still people out there who want us
to stay in our little corner of the galaxy.

09:12.493 --> 09:18.039
The news of a Vulcan-human hybrid could inflame them,
give them something to rally against.

09:18.039 --> 09:20.533
I can't believe we're talking
about more than a small minority.

09:20.533 --> 09:23.083
As I said, you've been away
for a while.

09:23.232 --> 09:26.882
Maybe I just have a little more
faith in humanity than you do.

09:27.648 --> 09:29.998
We can't afford to operate on faith.

09:30.307 --> 09:33.686
There's more at stake here than a simple trade agreement.
You fought the Xindi.

09:33.686 --> 09:37.407
You know better than anyone how Earth's survival
depends on alliances with other species.

09:37.407 --> 09:39.838
We don't have the Vulcans
watching our backs anymore.

09:39.838 --> 09:42.872
This isn't about finding
someone else to watch our backs.

09:43.028 --> 09:46.128
All I'm saying is that
there's strength in numbers.

09:47.231 --> 09:48.281
All right.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.308
I was hoping you'd have some
word on the investigation.

09:55.969 --> 09:59.435
My engineer and science officer
are eager to get some answers.

09:59.435 --> 10:02.123
I'm sure they are,
but I've heard nothing new.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.353
There's got to be something
we can do.

10:06.714 --> 10:12.214
Starfleet investigators are more than capable of handling this.
I suggest we let them do their job.

10:13.301 --> 10:17.601
I'll notify you the moment I hear something.
I appreciate your cooperation.

10:28.396 --> 10:30.396
Reed.
This is Captain Archer.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.241
I want you to talk
to an old friend.

10:57.144 --> 11:01.744
The last time we spoke, you asked me to never contact you again.
I contacted you.

11:03.522 --> 11:06.935
Susan Khouri... First, we need an understanding.
About what?

11:06.935 --> 11:10.277
That by speaking to me, you're back in the game.
Simple as that.

11:11.511 --> 11:12.661
Who was she?

11:12.934 --> 11:15.165
She was more than just an
emotionally troubled nurse.

11:15.165 --> 11:18.573
She was a member of an underground
isolationist movement, Terra Prime.

11:18.573 --> 11:22.012
I've heard of them.
They want to stop all contact with alien species.

11:22.012 --> 11:23.972
They believe it's corrupting
our way of life.

11:23.972 --> 11:26.550
I remember they made a lot of noise
back when Enterprise was launched.

11:26.550 --> 11:29.293
They had a resurgence
following the Xindi attack.

11:29.293 --> 11:32.851
We think Khouri was trying to leave the movement.
That's why they killed her?

11:32.851 --> 11:36.301
Her defection may have had
something to do with the child.

11:36.584 --> 11:38.234
I was getting to that.

11:38.407 --> 11:42.702
The child belongs to two of your crewmen.
You tell me. They claim they know anything about it.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.952
That doesn't seem likely, does it?

11:45.339 --> 11:46.639
I believe them.

11:46.641 --> 11:48.291
I admire your loyalty.

11:48.974 --> 11:54.274
We think Terra Prime is involved and that they're
planning something. You just don't know what?

11:54.294 --> 11:56.971
We suspect it has something
to do with the child.

11:56.971 --> 11:59.731
Find it, and we'll have the answers.

12:13.189 --> 12:14.639
You recruited her.

12:14.938 --> 12:16.638
I needed her expertise.

12:16.790 --> 12:20.190
I thought she was reliable.
Obviously, you were mistaken.

12:20.980 --> 12:24.395
If she'd told them anything truly damaging,
I think we'd know it by now.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.289
We can't be sure
what she told them.

12:27.402 --> 12:30.705
Anyway, I'm more concerned
with why she turned away from us.

12:30.705 --> 12:33.161
I think that she might have
become attached to the patient.

12:33.161 --> 12:36.874
She spent a great deal of time caring for it.
And what about you?

12:37.374 --> 12:38.074
Me?

12:38.697 --> 12:42.147
Yes. You've spent as much time
with that child as she did.

12:43.274 --> 12:47.124
I feel no differently about it
than anyone else that I've treated.

12:48.283 --> 12:49.983
This isn't anyone else.

12:50.162 --> 12:51.862
This is an abomination.

12:52.054 --> 12:55.204
And when the time comes,
it will be treated as such.

12:56.778 --> 12:57.978
I understand.

13:02.489 --> 13:04.889
Well, I'm going to miss this place...

13:06.072 --> 13:07.372
the simplicity.

13:08.165 --> 13:10.315
There's no middle ground here...

13:11.563 --> 13:13.313
and I can see the Earth.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.237
Send in Greaves on your way out.

13:18.530 --> 13:19.530
Yes, sir.

13:25.697 --> 13:29.141
I gave the men your message.
We'll be ready at a moment's notice.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.056
Tell them I appreciate
their hard work.

13:31.443 --> 13:35.843
They already know. There's one other thing--
a loose end that needs tying up.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.291
Put together a group.

13:38.460 --> 13:42.352
Have them meet me at the third
junction in, say, one hour.

13:43.593 --> 13:44.393
Done.

14:00.830 --> 14:03.482
The Tellarites are pushing for an embargo
against the Orions.

14:03.482 --> 14:07.387
They claim they've been attacking their freighters.
We have traded with the Orions for centuries.

14:07.387 --> 14:10.173
We would've known of these attacks.
This is Tellarite slander.

14:10.173 --> 14:12.081
You have to appreciate
their point of view.

14:12.081 --> 14:15.573
The Tellarites only want to deprive us
of valuable commerce.

14:15.573 --> 14:18.633
Coridan will never agree
to any trade sanctions.

14:18.844 --> 14:21.344
Ambassador, Captain Archer.
Ambassador.

14:22.959 --> 14:27.209
I need to contact my government
about the today's developments. Excuse me.

14:30.399 --> 14:31.899
How can I help you?

14:32.017 --> 14:36.017
I want everything Starfleet has on the investigation.
Why come to me?

14:36.343 --> 14:39.193
Because the Chief Investigator
turned me down.

14:39.319 --> 14:42.469
You can change his mind.
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

14:42.909 --> 14:45.509
Susan Khouri was a member
of Terra Prime.

14:46.451 --> 14:47.751
If that's true,

14:48.353 --> 14:50.153
it's extremely troubling.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.508
Not as troubling
as something else we learned.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.427
You were once a member.

15:00.075 --> 15:04.473
It seems you're doing fairly well investigating on your own.
That's why you wanted this kept quiet.

15:04.473 --> 15:07.823
I've already explained
why there was a need for secrecy.

15:07.993 --> 15:11.343
I was very young when I joined Terra Prime.
You were 18.

15:11.796 --> 15:15.996
Didn't you make any questionable choices
when you were that age, Captain?

15:17.893 --> 15:19.865
It was a stupid mistake.
I was a fool.

15:19.865 --> 15:24.844
My father had died in a freighter accident
and I blamed the pilot, who happened to be Denobulan.

15:24.987 --> 15:27.737
We all have our demons.
I've exorcised mine.

15:27.830 --> 15:31.180
I don't care what you did
when you were young, Minister.

15:31.314 --> 15:32.714
I need your help.

15:35.692 --> 15:37.292
I underestimated you.

15:38.863 --> 15:42.213
I suppose I'm not the first
person to make that mistake.

15:42.702 --> 15:45.402
You'll have your case file
within the hour.

15:46.433 --> 15:47.483
Thank you.

16:07.828 --> 16:09.328
Hmm, I can't decide

16:10.023 --> 16:12.523
if I like you better
in uniform or not.

16:13.771 --> 16:17.921
What are you doing here?
I've been assigned to do a story on Enterprise.

16:18.706 --> 16:23.542
Hmm, they can build a ship that goes faster than light,
but they can't give you a decent-sized room?

16:23.542 --> 16:24.700
A story?

16:24.906 --> 16:30.256
It's told from the perspective of the crew.
It'll cover the missions, the perils, life in space.

16:30.877 --> 16:33.790
So, shall we start with a tour?

16:34.184 --> 16:37.384
I've got some work to do.
You're not on duty. Gannet.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.062
Okay, so maybe

16:42.817 --> 16:44.767
I wasn't assigned the story.

16:46.140 --> 16:48.690
Maybe I suggested the idea
to my editor.

16:49.881 --> 16:55.181
He know how you feel about space exploration?
That it's the "last vestige of colonial impulse"?

16:55.367 --> 16:59.833
I only said that to keep you from signing onto this mission.
Find another story to do.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.067
It's too late.
It's due a week from today.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.068
Then you're gonna have to find
another source for your information.

17:04.068 --> 17:05.400
Why are you avoiding me?

17:05.400 --> 17:08.349
Can you give me one reason
why I shouldn't avoid you?

17:09.468 --> 17:11.117
We both called it off.

17:12.009 --> 17:13.809
It was a mutual decision.

17:13.929 --> 17:17.779
And it looks like you've changed your mind.
I haven't decided yet.

17:19.738 --> 17:22.387
That's the first honest thing
you've said.

17:23.425 --> 17:25.214
So, reward me

17:25.292 --> 17:26.992
by giving me that tour.

17:30.938 --> 17:32.138
Got a minute?

17:32.647 --> 17:33.697
Certainly.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.664
This baby...

17:40.442 --> 17:42.842
can you tell
if it's a boy or a girl?

17:43.354 --> 17:44.904
It's a girl.
A girl.

17:47.171 --> 17:51.392
Is it okay?
I mean, it's part human and part Vulcan.

17:52.616 --> 17:55.737
Vulcan and human physiology
are not all that dissimilar.

17:55.737 --> 18:00.101
From the evidence I have, there's no reason
to believe she's anything but perfectly healthy.

18:00.101 --> 18:01.109
That's good to hear.

18:01.109 --> 18:05.109
You'll also be interested to know
she has your eyes and T'Pol's ears.

18:07.043 --> 18:08.943
I-I still can't believe it.

18:09.719 --> 18:14.622
I'm in something of a quandary about it myself...
especially since T'Pol's never been pregnant.

18:14.622 --> 18:18.072
She could've gotten pregnant
and not told me about it. Ah.

18:19.202 --> 18:23.218
And she had the embryo removed
also without your knowledge?

18:24.636 --> 18:27.986
I believe you know the answer
to that theory, Commander.

18:29.246 --> 18:30.746
Yeah, I guess I do.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.247
We'll get to the bottom
of this soon enough.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.257
Until then, I suggest you keep
any such theories to yourself.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.579
That's good advice.

18:43.728 --> 18:46.778
You know, my father always
wanted a granddaughter.

18:48.686 --> 18:51.886
He bugged my sister about it constantly.
[chuckles]

18:51.981 --> 18:54.081
It seems he got his wish.
Yeah.

18:55.942 --> 18:56.742
Whoo.

18:59.467 --> 19:05.247
In the shadow of this incalculable devastation,
we find ourselves facing a colossal challenge.

19:05.392 --> 19:07.792
There's an entire world to rebuild...

19:08.030 --> 19:09.180
[applause]

19:09.227 --> 19:13.108
...not only our cities
and homes, but mankind itself!

19:14.197 --> 19:17.397
Now is not the time for timidity
and second guessing.

19:17.603 --> 19:19.953
We cannot afford
to doubt ourselves.

19:20.102 --> 19:24.119
The Third World War had just ended
and the cease-fire was barely two years old.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.463
Unless we act decisively,

19:27.874 --> 19:32.494
we will pass on the scars
of mutation and decay to future generations.

19:33.843 --> 19:35.952
Colonel Greene.
Colonel Greene.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.690
One of many men
history has misunderstood.

19:39.960 --> 19:43.410
For the sake of our children,
and our children's children,

19:44.330 --> 19:46.556
we must reject the impure

19:46.887 --> 19:48.446
and cast it out!

19:48.829 --> 19:50.739
[applause on TV]

19:51.271 --> 19:52.621
[shuts off TV]

19:53.399 --> 19:55.452
Before my father died
and left me in this facility,

19:55.452 --> 20:00.657
I was studying to be a historian,
until I had a very verbal confrontation

20:00.738 --> 20:05.788
with a certain professor who claimed that Greene
was nothing more than a genocidal madman.

20:05.835 --> 20:07.866
Sounds like we had the same professor.

20:07.866 --> 20:12.091
Greene euthanized hundreds of thousands
who were afflicted with radiation damage.

20:12.091 --> 20:15.924
Their millions of descendants
would've endured horrible disease, yet history

20:16.336 --> 20:20.436
history never says anything
about that suffering that Greene prevented.

20:20.483 --> 20:23.383
Guess it all depends
on who writes the history.

20:23.715 --> 20:27.217
Makes me wonder if I'll be remembered
with any more accuracy.

20:27.217 --> 20:29.515
I don't think you're going
to be misunderstood.

20:29.817 --> 20:33.117
Really? Sometimes, I'm not certain
I understand myself.

20:33.722 --> 20:36.822
We did what we had to do,
not what we wanted to do.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.487
I'm sure Greene told himself
the same thing.

20:40.576 --> 20:42.526
He was right, and so are we.

20:47.264 --> 20:51.810
Daniel, you are a wise man.

20:54.098 --> 20:57.998
Medical report of the patient.
Her symptoms are gone. She's a 100%.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.395
That's wonderful. Wonderful.

21:00.395 --> 21:01.445
Thank you.

21:18.774 --> 21:22.516
That was some serious flying,
trying to keep the warp fields aligned.

21:22.516 --> 21:26.882
Columbia was 50 meters above us.
One wrong move and we would've lost Commander Tucker.

21:26.882 --> 21:28.284
How did you keep your cool?

21:28.284 --> 21:32.444
When I was studying to be a pilot,
I memorized something Chuck Yeager said.

21:32.444 --> 21:34.250
<i>I never let myself be afraid.</i>

21:34.390 --> 21:37.590
<i>I just focus on the dials</i>
<i>and concentrate on flying.</i>

21:37.766 --> 21:41.016
That simple, huh?
Most of the time, simple works best.

21:48.745 --> 21:51.152
These are the shuttlepods.

21:52.188 --> 21:55.788
Which one did you use to penetrate
the Sphere in the Expanse?

21:56.033 --> 21:57.333
Shuttlepod One.

22:02.545 --> 22:04.395
Do you want to see inside?

22:04.396 --> 22:05.596
If it's okay.

22:11.020 --> 22:11.820
Oh...

22:12.327 --> 22:13.977
beautiful little ship.

22:14.761 --> 22:16.311
I always thought so.

22:17.439 --> 22:20.589
Unfortunately, we use
the shuttlepods less and less.

22:20.641 --> 22:21.391
Why?

22:22.020 --> 22:24.870
Getting more comfortable
with the transporter.

22:25.004 --> 22:26.154
Makes sense.

22:26.252 --> 22:30.121
It gets you there in a few seconds.
Yeah, but there's no skill involved.

22:30.121 --> 22:32.222
Mm-hmm. Nothing to fly.

22:33.289 --> 22:36.383
I've always had a tendency
to get attached to machines.

22:36.383 --> 22:39.005
It's crazy, but every time
we use the transporter,

22:39.452 --> 22:42.652
I feel we're kind of turning
our backs on these guys.

22:43.070 --> 22:47.670
Well, you can't make a choice without leaving something behind.
[camera clicks]

22:49.300 --> 22:53.300
When I saw you at that conference,
I started thinking about things...

22:53.899 --> 22:55.449
decisions I've made.

22:57.060 --> 23:00.560
Is it my imagination, or are you
actually opening up to me?

23:00.573 --> 23:01.823
Don't do that.

23:01.908 --> 23:02.708
What?

23:03.021 --> 23:07.021
Whenever things get a little serious,
you always turn it into a joke.

23:09.486 --> 23:10.886
It's a bad habit.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.176
I have a lot of those.

23:25.727 --> 23:27.277
There's another one.

23:28.713 --> 23:32.063
When I'm attracted to someone,
I can't hide it for long.

23:33.459 --> 23:35.232
You and your bad habits.

23:44.960 --> 23:50.056
The autopsy data confirms what we already knew:
Susan Khouri was killed by phase-pistol fire.

23:50.056 --> 23:55.074
The case file contains very little else
in the way of evidence. Some biographical data on Khouri.

23:55.074 --> 23:59.108
Most of it's out of date. They don't even know
where she'd been living for the past year.

23:59.108 --> 24:03.024
It's like she dropped off the face of the earth.
That may be exactly what happened.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.189
You know something?
Her blood had elevated levels of growth hormone.

24:06.189 --> 24:09.207
I ran some more tests
and found traces of myofibrilin.

24:09.563 --> 24:12.913
That's what they prescribe
for extended zero-g missions.

24:13.113 --> 24:15.792
It's hardly used anymore
outside of military exercises...

24:15.792 --> 24:17.684
not since the invention
of artificial gravity.

24:17.684 --> 24:21.743
It is still given to workers in remote places
where artificial gravity isn't practical.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.436
Like mining colonies.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.608
The nearest one is Orpheus...
on the moon.

24:25.608 --> 24:29.147
I have heard that the moon is a hotbed
of Terra Prime activity.

24:29.549 --> 24:33.099
You know, I think Travis
has a friend who worked on Orpheus.

24:33.312 --> 24:36.162
He might be able
to get a couple of us inside.

24:36.354 --> 24:39.004
We could pay a little visit...
undercover.

24:39.813 --> 24:42.063
I want to be a part
of that visit.

24:42.444 --> 24:44.494
I'd like to volunteer as well.

24:46.447 --> 24:49.197
Tell Travis to see what he can do.
Yes, sir.

25:14.496 --> 25:19.250
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.
With help from Travis's contact, Trip and T'Pol

25:19.425 --> 25:22.625
have been processed
into the Orpheus Mining Facility.

25:33.198 --> 25:42.485
[high-pitched whirring]

25:42.702 --> 25:46.116
This is the second time we've been through here.
We've seen all this before.

25:46.116 --> 25:49.397
We still have 20 minutes
before we have to report to the foreman.

25:49.397 --> 25:51.255
Maybe you downloaded an outdated map.

25:51.430 --> 25:54.480
The map is correct.
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

25:54.839 --> 25:56.789
We could ask for directions.

25:57.019 --> 25:58.219
Give me that.

26:04.604 --> 26:07.804
I think I know what the problem is.
What? We're lost.

26:10.489 --> 26:15.439
Let's try that direction. Any particular reason?
It's the only tunnel I don't recognize.

26:20.981 --> 26:26.081
Trip... I think we're getting there.
I know you're not convinced I've told you the truth...

26:26.766 --> 26:28.116
about the child.

26:28.406 --> 26:29.806
What do you mean?

26:29.904 --> 26:34.904
You think I might have gotten pregnant without your knowledge.
I never said that. I know.

26:36.401 --> 26:38.551
You been talking to Phlox.
No...

26:39.284 --> 26:40.284
Have you?

26:42.022 --> 26:45.588
Look, it's because you're Vulcan, isn't it,
that-that-that you know all this. I believe so.

26:45.588 --> 26:50.288
I am sick and tired of this "bond" we've got.
I don't particularly enjoy it either.

26:51.129 --> 26:54.029
Listen, for the last time
and for the record...

26:54.107 --> 26:55.507
I do believe you.

26:56.194 --> 26:58.844
And if you get anymore "feelings"...
what?

27:01.124 --> 27:02.374
There it is...

27:02.956 --> 27:04.306
Come on, let's go.

27:10.964 --> 27:13.514
I'm glad we finally left the shuttlepod.

27:13.573 --> 27:16.723
I thought you liked shuttlepods.
I like flying them.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.577
Hmm...
sure felt like we were flying.

27:30.385 --> 27:31.735
I have a rule...

27:31.773 --> 27:35.273
if I'm in bed with someone,
they have to be in bed with me.

27:36.416 --> 27:37.666
What was that?

27:42.976 --> 27:45.234
You... are not here.

27:46.575 --> 27:49.325
I'm just worried
about some friends of mine.

27:49.581 --> 27:51.431
You want to talk about it?

27:51.537 --> 27:53.987
I'm under orders not
to talk about it.

27:54.380 --> 27:58.680
That's the last thing you should tell a reporter.
Let's change the subject.

27:59.212 --> 28:01.462
How come you haven't settled down?

28:01.616 --> 28:03.816
I'm never going to settle down...

28:04.932 --> 28:09.932
but that doesn't mean I'm not going to get serious
with someone if the right circumstance

28:10.207 --> 28:11.357
comes along.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.370
What constitutes the "right circumstance"?

28:15.108 --> 28:17.108
I'll know it when it happens.

28:18.296 --> 28:22.496
What did you mean earlier about reconsidering
some decisions you've made?

28:25.404 --> 28:27.654
I've spent my whole life in space,

28:28.324 --> 28:30.524
going from one place
to the next.

28:32.024 --> 28:33.224
Seeing you...

28:33.961 --> 28:35.611
I was wondering, maybe

28:36.057 --> 28:37.557
the next challenge,

28:38.108 --> 28:39.458
at least for me,

28:39.604 --> 28:41.954
is to stay in one place
for a while.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.521
Hoshi...
Hmm? No word yet from Trip or T'Pol.

28:55.429 --> 28:57.679
Is there anything
I can help with?

28:57.982 --> 29:02.046
Six of the universal translators
started confusing Rigellian with Andorian.

29:02.046 --> 29:04.996
There's a glitch somewhere,
but I can't find it.

29:05.713 --> 29:06.813
Carry on...

29:25.382 --> 29:26.882
Fresh off the boat?

29:27.946 --> 29:31.296
One of the S-K models...
they only give 'em to grubbers.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.300
I guess you found me out.

29:37.855 --> 29:38.755
Josiah.

29:40.029 --> 29:40.929
Turner.

29:41.057 --> 29:43.307
What brings you to this dump-site?

29:43.754 --> 29:47.278
Uh... change of scenery.
Yeah, that's what I was after, too.

29:47.278 --> 29:49.755
Only it wasn't the landscape
I got sick of...

29:52.870 --> 29:54.992
Least there aren't as many of 'em up here.

29:54.992 --> 29:58.738
Seems like everywhere you go,
humans are getting to be an endangered species.

29:59.114 --> 30:00.614
Know what you mean.

30:01.509 --> 30:06.325
Bad enough you can't walk down the street
without some freak-show scaring the hell outta your kids.

30:06.325 --> 30:09.225
Now the government's
making treaties with them.

30:09.512 --> 30:12.028
Sometimes I wonder
where it's all gonna end.

30:12.028 --> 30:16.387
It's gonna end with human beings becoming
second-class citizens on their own world.

30:16.892 --> 30:20.692
Well, someone's gotta make a stand.
Yeah, that's how I feel, too.

30:22.426 --> 30:24.926
Some of us are meeting
tonight at 2200.

30:24.946 --> 30:26.846
Level seven, junction four.

30:26.934 --> 30:30.584
I think you'll like what we have to say.
I'll try and make it.

30:30.776 --> 30:32.226
I'll look for you.

30:35.698 --> 30:37.498
I've learned something...

30:40.033 --> 30:42.983
One of the locals isn't very fond of Vulcans.
You were saying?

30:42.983 --> 30:46.024
A doctor from one of the medical facilities
was found dead yesterday.

30:46.024 --> 30:47.564
They think it was a cave-in.

30:47.564 --> 30:51.464
You're not buying it.
He worked at the same clinic as Susan Khouri.

30:53.153 --> 30:56.003
I think we each know
what we're doing tonight.

30:59.917 --> 31:01.467
Seven million people

31:01.901 --> 31:03.451
wiped out by aliens.

31:04.094 --> 31:06.294
Did the Xindi even apologize?
No!

31:06.331 --> 31:09.530
No! Did our government
ever demd an apology? No!

31:10.197 --> 31:14.247
And where are the reparations
for the families of those seven million?

31:14.562 --> 31:18.797
And now, those same leaders want
to form a "Coalition" with Tellarites, Andorians,

31:18.797 --> 31:21.212
Rigellians, Coridanites and Vulcans!

31:21.630 --> 31:25.591
Vulcans who, not too long ago,
massacred 45 humans working

31:25.702 --> 31:27.302
at the Earth embassy!

31:27.400 --> 31:32.150
Nathan Samuels claims that future generations
will look back on this era with pride.

31:33.359 --> 31:37.196
But if things keep going the way they're going,
there won't be any future generations...

31:37.196 --> 31:38.696
at least not human.

31:40.103 --> 31:43.403
I love humanity too much
to sit by and let that happen.

32:13.912 --> 32:18.676
It's estimated that there are
at least 5,000 unregistered aliens on Earth.

32:19.155 --> 32:21.874
Now another study puts
that figure at 10,000.

32:21.874 --> 32:28.383
This insanity is the direct result of our government's policy
and the enforcers of that policy: Starfleet!

32:28.399 --> 32:30.099
[shouts of agreement]

32:31.470 --> 32:34.426
We need to send a message
to the people in power.

32:34.426 --> 32:37.579
And there's someone here tonight
who is going to help us do just that:

32:37.579 --> 32:38.818
Commander Tucker...

32:41.208 --> 32:43.258
...of the Starship Enterprise!

32:51.015 --> 32:55.465
All that stuff I said about leaving the ship...
Of course it's off the record.

32:57.030 --> 33:01.430
While you're on duty, you mind if I stay here and work a bit?
[door chimes]

33:08.234 --> 33:10.084
I need to speak to Gannet.

33:11.916 --> 33:13.266
Something wrong?

33:13.654 --> 33:14.854
Come with us.

33:14.908 --> 33:15.758
Where?

33:16.106 --> 33:20.056
What's going on?
She's not here to do a story on Enterprise, Travis.

33:22.543 --> 33:23.643
She's a spy

33:24.445 --> 33:25.795
for Terra Prime.

33:35.775 --> 33:37.225
Are you all right?

33:37.257 --> 33:38.357
I think so.

33:39.763 --> 33:43.013
What did you do to her?
Hey, hey... Not nearly enough.

33:44.334 --> 33:46.134
It's not worth it, Romeo.

33:46.701 --> 33:48.401
Juliet's in good hands.

33:49.251 --> 33:51.201
The two star-crossed lovers.

33:51.779 --> 33:58.308
I can't help but wonder whether your little drama will end
happier than that famous double suicide in a medieval tomb.

33:58.576 --> 34:00.176
Who the hell are you?

34:00.257 --> 34:02.957
John Frederick Paxton.
I run this facility.

34:03.505 --> 34:05.825
Not for long.
You're right there, Commander.

34:05.825 --> 34:08.610
My mining business is about
to take a turn for the worse.

34:08.610 --> 34:09.942
Daniel, get started.

34:14.559 --> 34:17.000
You're behind this.
Behind this? No.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.697
I lead this.
And proudly, too.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.806
Before you ask,
your child is safe and sound.

34:22.806 --> 34:25.569
Finally sleeping through the night.

34:25.841 --> 34:29.940
I'd forgotten how much trouble a newborn can be.
I want to see her. No.

34:31.118 --> 34:34.851
And "no" is a word that Starfleet
better get used to hearing from now on.

34:34.851 --> 34:37.202
Because up until today,
it's always been "yes", hasn't it?

34:37.202 --> 34:39.494
"Yes, yes, go right ahead. roam the stars.

34:39.494 --> 34:43.216
"Yes, inform potentially hostile species
of the whereabouts of Earth.

34:43.216 --> 34:48.827
"Yes, entrust the entire future of our world
to non-human creatures who don't even feel like we do.

34:48.902 --> 34:51.838
"Yes, promote the total
degradation of mankind

34:52.110 --> 34:54.159
"by encouraging alien-human...

34:55.824 --> 34:56.924
relations."

34:57.577 --> 34:58.677
Well, "yes"

34:58.738 --> 35:02.027
is a word that ends here and now.

35:03.532 --> 35:06.232
I'm returning Earth
to its rightful owners.

35:06.971 --> 35:09.390
I am giving Earth back to humanity,

35:09.589 --> 35:11.189
back to human beings.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.292
It is my life's work.

35:13.650 --> 35:15.600
It is what I was born to do,

35:15.823 --> 35:21.118
and there is no one -- not an alien, not a human --
that will stop me from achieving it.

35:25.146 --> 35:29.710
My father designed this facility.
He knew that mining was an unpredictable business.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.671
Mines tap out, veins dry up.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.763
Everyone's aboard, sir.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.191
Go to launch mode, Daniel.

35:36.550 --> 35:38.050
You're an engineer.

35:38.389 --> 35:40.489
I think you'll appreciate this.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.890
Take a good long look.

35:55.214 --> 35:59.264
Where are we going?
For you, this'll be like a walk across the street.

36:00.912 --> 36:02.012
Lock it up.

36:05.394 --> 36:09.544
You better hang onto something.
She gets a little rusty out of the gate.

36:27.037 --> 36:32.237
You reconfigured your universal translator
to record messages from all the other translators.

36:32.771 --> 36:37.735
You were spying on the delegates.
You accidentally triggered an ID protocol in the network.

36:37.735 --> 36:41.197
I tracked it back to the source.
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:41.197 --> 36:44.297
You sure know what everyone else
was talking about.

36:44.322 --> 36:46.272
Maybe she was after a story.

36:46.642 --> 36:50.547
It doesn't mean she worked for Terra Prime.
We did a background check.

36:50.547 --> 36:54.374
In the last month, you made
three trips to the lunar colony.

36:54.542 --> 36:59.092
Is that a crime? Depends on what you were doing there.
I was on assignment. For?

36:59.807 --> 37:03.007
My news agency.
Your editor claims he never sent you.

37:04.873 --> 37:09.449
Look, if I'm under arrest, then...
Two of my crewmen are at Orpheus Mining Complex.

37:09.449 --> 37:14.549
We've lost contact with them. I don't know anything
about your crewmen. Are they in danger?

37:16.682 --> 37:18.682
I want to speak with counsel.

37:20.549 --> 37:21.299
Now.

37:23.410 --> 37:26.360
Take her to the brig.
Get her whoever she wants.

37:33.014 --> 37:34.814
Bridge to Captain Archer.

37:36.992 --> 37:38.442
I'm sorry, Travis.

37:42.626 --> 37:46.276
Archer.
A large vessel is taking off from the mining facility.

37:46.391 --> 37:50.541
Can you identify it?
Sir, sensors indicate... it is the mining facility.

37:53.129 --> 37:55.829
We're being hailed.
It's Starfleet Command.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.132
Ignore them.

37:57.516 --> 37:58.816
Reactor status?

37:58.923 --> 37:59.773
Ready.

38:00.086 --> 38:02.636
You're going to warp?
Five second burst.

38:02.669 --> 38:06.019
Inside the system.
We'll be lucky if we don't fly apart.

38:06.269 --> 38:07.569
I plan on luck.

38:08.471 --> 38:09.171
Go.

38:09.789 --> 38:10.939
Ten seconds.

38:31.701 --> 38:32.751
Hail them.

38:34.329 --> 38:36.279
Pursuit course, Travis.
Aye.

38:36.968 --> 38:38.368
No response, sir.

38:39.478 --> 38:42.328
Tell Starfleet Command
we're going after them.

38:51.381 --> 38:52.931
We're in Mars orbit.

38:54.040 --> 38:58.190
All systems functioning.
That was a magnificent piece of flying, Daniel.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.217
That is yet to come.
Impress me again.

39:01.835 --> 39:03.135
Taking us down.

39:13.048 --> 39:14.248
Let's see it.

39:27.881 --> 39:29.431
Slowing our descent.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.730
Tie us in.

39:57.493 --> 39:58.543
It's ours.

39:59.933 --> 40:01.633
Let's take in the view.

40:11.486 --> 40:13.436
This is where it all begins.

40:15.005 --> 40:15.905
Josiah.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.616
They're on the surface.

40:19.641 --> 40:20.491
Where?

40:20.790 --> 40:24.790
They've landed near the verteron array.
It's used to redirect comets.

40:26.059 --> 40:29.309
They're sending a subspace
message on all frequencies.

40:32.261 --> 40:34.461
My name is John Frederick Paxton.

40:34.533 --> 40:37.283
I've just taken over
the verteron on Mars.

40:37.507 --> 40:40.707
I can now fire on any ship
or facility in the system.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.434
He's targeted Earth's moon.

40:59.772 --> 41:01.584
I have no intention
of using this weapon again,

41:01.584 --> 41:06.960
provided that every single non-human
in our system leaves immediately.

41:08.214 --> 41:09.814
A new era is at hand,

41:10.134 --> 41:13.582
an era that will expose
the concept of interspecies unity

41:13.952 --> 41:16.052
as an absolute and vicious lie.

41:16.673 --> 41:22.138
An era that will witness the advent of a human-centered
consciousness that will place our world

41:22.717 --> 41:24.167
before all others.

41:24.957 --> 41:28.407
As of this moment,
mankind casts off the shackles

41:28.887 --> 41:30.532
of alien interference

41:31.041 --> 41:32.501
and now determines

41:32.996 --> 41:34.319
its own fate.

41:35.550 --> 41:36.800
Terra Prime...

41:38.126 --> 41:39.076
forever.
