00:03.780 --> 00:05.980
Previously on Broadchurch...

00:06.380 --> 00:08.538
100 quid says that's the boat they
used

00:08.540 --> 00:10.540
and those hairs belonged to Danny.

00:10.740 --> 00:13.457
Mum? Why don't you understand
the trouble we're in?

00:13.459 --> 00:16.577
Do they know about us? Cos you ain't
16 yet. Nobody knows.

00:16.579 --> 00:19.980
If you or your family need to speak
you call me.

00:21.140 --> 00:23.297
I don't talk to the press.
You're a newsagent.

00:23.299 --> 00:25.257
I sell 'em. I don't want to be in
'em.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.977
Do you have a conviction for
underage sex? Weasel!

00:27.979 --> 00:29.898
Jack's got a history with kids.

00:29.900 --> 00:33.577
They're going to be saying things
about me and those things aren't
true.

00:33.579 --> 00:35.938
You took pictures of the boys in the
Sea Brigade.

00:35.940 --> 00:38.657
Where were you the night of Danny's
death? Reading a book.

00:38.659 --> 00:40.738
I was at home.
Having sex.

00:40.740 --> 00:42.740
I know about you and Becca Fisher.

00:44.460 --> 00:47.820
Reconstruction. Thursday night. One
week on.

00:48.699 --> 00:50.699
Your boy Tom, he should do it.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.780 --> 01:52.138
Tell me this will make a difference.
I'm sure it will.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.540
I hate the thought of him out here
alone at this time of night.

02:01.340 --> 02:05.699
Our Father who art in heaven:
hallowed be thy name.

02:06.539 --> 02:08.139
Thy kingdom come...

02:08.740 --> 02:10.739
Do you think it was him?

02:12.139 --> 02:14.177
I'm not speculating about anybody.

02:14.179 --> 02:16.738
Yeah, you might not be, but
everybody else is.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.098
Well, people need to calm down.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.820
They'll calm down
as soon as you arrest someone.

02:22.660 --> 02:26.179
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

02:28.739 --> 02:30.740
Amen.

02:34.519 --> 02:37.597
An eerie silence enveloped the town
of Broadchurch tonight

02:37.599 --> 02:41.517
as local residents came out in force
to support the Latimer family.

02:41.519 --> 02:44.037
United in grief they walked in
silent vigil

02:44.039 --> 02:46.877
along the route where Danny Latimer
was last seen

02:46.879 --> 02:49.077
the night before his body was found

02:49.079 --> 02:51.637
beneath the cliffs on Broadchurch
beach.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.957
Police are hoping the reconstruction
will jog people's memories

02:54.959 --> 02:57.876
for vital evidence surrounding
Danny's death.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.637
And provide fresh leads for an
investigation

03:00.639 --> 03:03.516
that is showing no sign of leading to
an arrest.

03:03.518 --> 03:06.119
Some within the town...
National news now.

03:06.799 --> 03:11.316
Since the interview.
The journalist was right.

03:11.318 --> 03:13.318
Do you think it was Jack Marshall?

03:13.959 --> 03:16.716
'..And townspeople fear the events
of the past few weeks

03:16.718 --> 03:18.918
may have changed their town
forever.'

03:23.678 --> 03:26.279
When are we gonna talk about
what's happened?

03:27.358 --> 03:29.397
You mean what you did?

03:29.399 --> 03:31.399
Yeah.

03:33.359 --> 03:35.396
OK.

03:35.398 --> 03:37.398
You...

03:38.478 --> 03:41.558
You selfish, childish...

03:43.399 --> 03:45.997
egotistical, self-centred bastard.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.998
Yeah.
Two children.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.717
Two children.

03:50.719 --> 03:55.477
15 years of... collecting all of
everyone's shit and...

03:55.479 --> 03:58.956
and washing it and cleaning it
and folding it and tidying it.

03:58.958 --> 04:01.959
And going back to the start
like I'm on a bloody wheel.

04:03.239 --> 04:05.877
I've had offers too, you know.
I'm sure you have.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.716
I could have shagged my way round
your mates at the Kings Arms.

04:08.718 --> 04:10.718
I'm sure.
But I didn't.

04:12.438 --> 04:14.839
Because I'm... I'm a human being.

04:15.679 --> 04:17.797
Not a bloody animal.

04:17.798 --> 04:21.398
15... 15 I've been with you since.

04:23.479 --> 04:26.076
Do you still fancy me?
Of course I do.

04:26.078 --> 04:30.199
No, not of course you do.
You had sex with someone else. Why?

04:32.079 --> 04:34.079
What don't you get from me?

04:35.638 --> 04:37.199
Truthfully.

04:42.398 --> 04:44.638
Surprise.
Cos, what? Cos I'm...

04:45.718 --> 04:49.759
I'm not inventive enough. Not
experimental enough. What is it you
want?

04:50.319 --> 04:52.319
Eh? S and M?
No.

04:52.919 --> 04:55.516
Role play? Threesomes?
Don't put words in my mouth.

04:55.518 --> 04:57.357
Dull, right? Well, I'm sorry.

04:57.359 --> 04:59.196
But if I'm dull it's only because

04:59.198 --> 05:01.436
I've never slept with anyone apart
from you.

05:01.438 --> 05:03.437
It wasn't about you, Beth.

05:03.439 --> 05:05.759
You make me feel so special. Thanks,
Mark.

05:08.239 --> 05:10.916
Becca, then. What's so great about
her

05:10.918 --> 05:13.478
that it's worth risking all this
for?

05:14.518 --> 05:16.556
You really want to know?
Yeah.

05:16.558 --> 05:18.559
She was different.

05:19.999 --> 05:23.439
That's it. Not prettier or sexier or
nothing. Just...

05:25.998 --> 05:27.797
New.

05:27.799 --> 05:30.319
And, I don't know, this...

05:31.078 --> 05:34.239
house and this town and this job
of mine...

05:35.238 --> 05:38.517
It's all my life's ever gonna be,
isn't it? I knew every second of it.

05:38.519 --> 05:41.079
And every second of it to come.

05:42.878 --> 05:45.197
I just felt trapped, Beth.

05:45.199 --> 05:47.916
And that's why I did it. And I wish
to God I hadn't.

05:47.918 --> 05:50.277
And I wish to God that I could get

05:50.279 --> 05:53.198
our old, predictable, beautiful life
back.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.079
Because what I wouldn't give for
that right now.

05:58.639 --> 06:00.879
But... I can't, can I?

06:06.918 --> 06:08.918
I don't want to lose you, Beth.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.398
But I think I already have.
I'm pregnant.

06:19.119 --> 06:21.156
Since when?

06:21.158 --> 06:23.158
Ouzo night.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.839
First shag in months. Thanks, ouzo.

06:28.039 --> 06:31.798
You have to keep it. I don't have to
do anything you say right now.

06:35.359 --> 06:36.916
'And the closing headlines:

06:36.918 --> 06:40.516
hundreds of residents in the town of
Broadchurch lined the streets tonight

06:40.518 --> 06:44.676
to watch the reconstruction of the
last-known moments of Danny Latimer.'

06:44.678 --> 06:48.356
Press clippings on Jack Marshall.
Everything since he moved here.

06:48.358 --> 06:50.316
Brilliant. Anything interesting?

06:50.318 --> 06:52.516
There's a good photo of him
with the Sea Brigade.

06:52.518 --> 06:54.677
Wow. Where did you get this photo of
Jack?

06:54.679 --> 06:58.237
He got papped at the Latimers'.
Photographer came to the hotel, we
bought it.

06:58.239 --> 07:00.676
Why did he go and see the family?
Exactly.

07:00.678 --> 07:03.117
Right. We need 400 words
on the reconstruction,

07:03.119 --> 07:05.676
and then main article - the
exclusive.

07:05.678 --> 07:09.237
Everything you dug up on Jack,
especially his previous conviction.

07:09.239 --> 07:11.276
You're gonna write it.
What, me?

07:11.278 --> 07:13.397
Look at your little face. Yes, you.

07:13.399 --> 07:15.556
You did the work, you write the
article.

07:15.558 --> 07:18.199
We can run it under my byline. Be
our secret. Right.

07:19.559 --> 07:22.117
A list of the boats reported missing
in the last month.

07:22.119 --> 07:23.477
Any matches?
No.

07:23.479 --> 07:26.559
Also, details from North Yorkshire
on that cold case.

07:26.958 --> 07:29.838
Er... young girl, ten years old.
Raped and killed.

07:31.039 --> 07:33.357
Her body was found on top of a cliff
at Whitby.

07:33.359 --> 07:35.716
She'd been stabbed. So it's nothing
like this MO.

07:35.718 --> 07:37.316
I'll look at it. What else?

07:37.318 --> 07:39.477
Forensics have come back on the
phone.

07:39.479 --> 07:41.357
Mark's prints, but he handled it.

07:41.359 --> 07:44.636
Danny's DNA and Jack Marshall's,
which tallies with him finding it.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.476
Or he claimed to find it cos he knew
his DNA was already on it.

07:47.478 --> 07:51.557
Funny thing is, Mark confirmed the
phone was Danny's when Jack handed
it to him, but...

07:51.559 --> 07:53.957
I always saw Danny with a smartphone
like Tom's.

07:53.959 --> 07:55.836
Did we get any data off the handset?

07:55.838 --> 07:58.876
Nothing. Everything's been set to
forward to another number.

07:58.878 --> 08:02.357
That swankier device that you saw
him with - can we trace that number?

08:02.359 --> 08:05.676
Yeah, but it's a pay-as-you-go SIM.
It's turned off, no signal.

08:05.678 --> 08:07.757
Why does a kid his age have two
phones?

08:07.759 --> 08:09.759
How could he afford this other one?

08:09.838 --> 08:11.838
The cash we found in his room?

08:13.758 --> 08:16.038
Could that money
have come from Jack Marshall?

08:23.439 --> 08:25.397
Did you see your son at the end
tonight?

08:25.399 --> 08:27.436
A bit. He just wanted to go home.

08:27.438 --> 08:30.719
You tell him from me, he's a good
lad. He did right by Danny.

08:40.839 --> 08:43.639
You did good tonight, buddy.
Thanks.

08:44.479 --> 08:46.516
Definitely.

08:46.518 --> 08:48.518
Dad, what does Mum think happened?

08:48.879 --> 08:51.357
Mate, she doesn't talk to me about
it.

08:51.359 --> 08:53.957
Work and home - they're two
different things.

08:53.959 --> 08:56.596
Does she think Danny knew the person
who killed him?

08:56.598 --> 08:58.759
I don't know.
What about the phone?

09:00.079 --> 09:02.117
The one Mr Marshall had.

09:02.119 --> 09:04.118
Did they find anything on it?

09:04.678 --> 09:07.196
I'm sure Mum will tell us anything
we need to know.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.999
We have to let her do her job.

09:09.518 --> 09:13.116
How long would someone get sent to
prison for if they killed someone?

09:13.118 --> 09:16.119
I don't know, 20 years or something.
Why are you asking?

09:16.879 --> 09:18.917
I just... wondered.

09:18.919 --> 09:20.918
I miss him, Dad.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.159
I know. We all do.

09:33.598 --> 09:36.878
Bloody hell, you work late.
Jesus, what you doing here?

09:37.518 --> 09:40.236
Thought I'd come and see you.
No, you didn't.

09:40.238 --> 09:42.196
Go away, Lucy, we've got nothing to
say.

09:42.198 --> 09:43.956
What? You won't even hear me out?

09:43.958 --> 09:46.077
Are you ready to seek professional
help?

09:46.079 --> 09:47.957
I don't need that sort of help.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.316
I just need a bit of money to stand
me up again.

09:50.318 --> 09:53.877
Oh, here we go. Look at you.
Nothing changes, does it?

09:53.879 --> 09:56.437
Even with everything going on,
you're self-obsessed.

09:56.439 --> 09:58.996
ã1,000, 900, and I'll be sorted.
I've lent you 3,000.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.517
I saw something. I think you'll want
to know. What are you talking about?

10:02.519 --> 10:04.559
The night Danny Latimer got killed.

10:06.278 --> 10:08.796
I don't believe you.
I'm your bloody sister.

10:08.798 --> 10:11.076
You'd even use a boy's death to your
own ends.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.076
You never fail to let me down.

10:13.078 --> 10:16.636
Right, what did you see the night
Danny was killed? What night was it,
even?

10:16.638 --> 10:18.839
It was a Thursday.
Yeah, go on, then.

10:20.838 --> 10:22.479
Lend me that grand and I'll tell
you.

10:23.319 --> 10:25.318
I don't even know you.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.997
OK, we need his age here, right at
the top. Yeah.

10:34.999 --> 10:37.436
Tell them where the newsagent's was
in the town,

10:37.438 --> 10:39.356
how close to where the body was
found.

10:39.358 --> 10:43.117
What, quarter of a mile? His house
is closer, on top of the beach.

10:43.119 --> 10:45.119
And you haven't put that in there?

10:45.919 --> 10:48.838
Didn't think.
Thinking definitely helps, Olly.

10:49.079 --> 10:51.037
Right. Structure.

10:51.039 --> 10:54.597
Fifth para should be the third.
That's where you want the detail in
his past.

10:54.599 --> 10:58.116
Then we move these two sentences
to the top of the second para.

10:58.118 --> 11:01.438
And... make this the close. See?

11:02.598 --> 11:05.477
Yeah, it's brilliant.
That is brilliant, it's loads better.

11:05.479 --> 11:08.117
It's good. It's got all the facts,
asks questions,

11:08.119 --> 11:10.837
clear point of view, but nothing
sensationalised.

11:10.839 --> 11:13.959
You did well. You'll make someone a
lovely apprentice.

11:15.399 --> 11:17.797
Shall we send?
Really?

11:17.799 --> 11:19.799
Well, they're waiting.

11:20.319 --> 11:22.359
Send.
OK.

11:26.039 --> 11:28.076
What you doing?
Sorry.

11:28.078 --> 11:31.597
I've wanted to do that since you
walked in. Cheeky bastard. We're
working.

11:31.599 --> 11:33.996
Sorry, yeah. I'm sorry, it
was... inappropriate.

11:33.998 --> 11:35.999
Yeah, it was.

11:58.959 --> 12:02.997
He's got a conviction for
kiddie-fiddling and they're letting
him serve ice-creams.

12:02.999 --> 12:05.157
Who are we? We look after things
ourselves.

12:05.159 --> 12:08.996
If things are wrong we sort them
out. We have to wait till they got
enough evidence.

12:08.998 --> 12:11.637
It's all over the paper.
How much proof do you need?

12:11.639 --> 12:15.477
And what if waiting for evidence
means it's too late? What if there's
another kid?

12:15.479 --> 12:19.276
Say he has got something to do with
it and we've just let him carry on.
How sick...

12:19.278 --> 12:21.117
Enough! All right?

12:21.119 --> 12:23.157
Stop banging on at me.

12:23.159 --> 12:26.479
You know I can't do nothing.
You want to do something, fine.

12:42.231 --> 12:45.149
Well, as you can see,
the police tape's coming down.

12:45.151 --> 12:48.549
The beaches are fully opened, it's a
beautiful part of the world and...

12:48.551 --> 12:53.429
we hope people aren't put off coming
by this... tragic, yet isolated
event.

12:53.431 --> 12:55.431
Thank you very much for your time.

12:56.967 --> 13:01.605
Did I sound like a complete
arsehole? Not a complete one, no.

13:01.607 --> 13:04.165
I'm up next, so you'll have some
competition.

13:04.167 --> 13:06.885
They bring us out here so they can
hear the sound of the sea.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.085
I hate this stuff, never done it
before. I do it all the time.

13:10.087 --> 13:12.165
It's just no-one normally cares.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.845
Except my mum. It's the only time
she believes I'm a real priest.

13:15.847 --> 13:17.847
That's parents for you.
Yeah.

13:19.327 --> 13:22.087
Have you got family here?
No. Melbourne.

13:22.847 --> 13:24.847
Worrying about me.

13:25.407 --> 13:28.325
Wasn't there a guy
who used to run the Traders with you?

13:28.327 --> 13:30.685
My partner. Ex-partner.

13:30.687 --> 13:33.167
Business partner?
Everything partner.

13:33.407 --> 13:36.645
Yeah, here's what I've learned.
Don't buy a hotel with a dickhead.

13:36.647 --> 13:40.325
Good advice. Paul's letter to the
Corinthians says much the same.

13:40.327 --> 13:42.365
You're funny.

13:42.367 --> 13:44.367
Never met a funny vicar before.

13:47.607 --> 13:51.287
Have you seen the Herald today?
Yeah. Think it's him?

13:54.007 --> 13:56.047
I can't believe it would be.

13:56.847 --> 13:59.367
He's a bit weird, though, you've got
to admit.

14:00.247 --> 14:02.247
We all have our foibles.

14:03.047 --> 14:05.087
Reverend?
Oh, I'm up.

14:09.847 --> 14:11.887
Andy!

14:25.767 --> 14:27.807
Oh, shit, I slept in!

14:31.127 --> 14:34.525
You are gonna use the back entrance?
You really are one dirty girl.

14:34.527 --> 14:37.365
No, when you leave. Go out the back.
Yes, right.

14:37.367 --> 14:40.245
Sorry.
I don't want any small-town gossip.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.565
But... you know, it was... what we...

14:43.567 --> 14:45.205
You know, it was nice.
You mean the sex?

14:45.207 --> 14:48.407
Yes, the sex that we had for quite a
while.

14:49.887 --> 14:53.165
It was all right, wasn't it?
You really are quite needy, Olly.

14:53.167 --> 14:55.725
Always wanting affirmation.
Has anyone told you that?

14:55.727 --> 14:58.725
I just like good feedback.
The sex was good.

14:58.727 --> 15:01.287
Great.
No, just good.

15:02.407 --> 15:05.047
Happy to give it another go?
Maybe.

15:07.087 --> 15:11.525
Hey, I was just wondering. You know
that boat that the police found?

15:11.527 --> 15:15.165
How would you get out that far?
Would you row? Do you need a motor?

15:15.167 --> 15:18.605
When did you have time to wonder
about that? Do you know or not?

15:18.607 --> 15:21.407
We could see if you er... if you call
me later.

15:22.447 --> 15:24.727
So is it back entrance?
Out.

15:26.887 --> 15:28.887
And shut the bloody door.

15:36.887 --> 15:38.887
This isn't what we wrote.

15:40.367 --> 15:44.125
Yeah, tell everyone. They boycott
his shop, nobody's to go near him.

15:44.127 --> 15:46.607
Get off the phone now.
Yep, OK. Bye.

15:51.087 --> 15:53.845
Where's Mum?
Went out for a run first thing.

15:53.847 --> 15:57.205
Again. That's all she does now.
Can't she bear to be with us?

15:57.207 --> 15:59.247
It's her way of coping.

15:59.377 --> 16:03.467
Now, listen to me. I know Jack Marshall and
he's not what they're calling him in there.

16:03.553 --> 16:06.913
He's been in prison, Gran.
He saw Danny every day.

16:07.413 --> 16:11.331
Plenty of people saw him every day.
Jack Marshall wouldn't hurt a fly.

16:11.333 --> 16:13.891
He had sex with a kid.
You don't know the full details.

16:13.893 --> 16:16.671
You believe everything you read.
You told us to go with the Herald.

16:16.673 --> 16:18.791
Now you're saying we can't believe
them.

16:18.793 --> 16:20.911
Not when they're accusing people I
know.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.271
We wait and see what the police do.
The police?

16:23.273 --> 16:25.671
We learn more from the papers
than from the police.

16:25.673 --> 16:29.111
I'm not sure that's fair.
Pete, what is the point of you?

16:29.113 --> 16:32.231
You're just getting fat off
all the toast that we make you!

16:32.233 --> 16:35.391
That's enough. I'm right, though.
They haven't got a clue.

16:35.393 --> 16:38.391
They take Dad in for questioning
while Jack is a paedophile.

16:38.393 --> 16:41.231
Stop talking like that. Just cos you
have a soft spot for him,

16:41.233 --> 16:43.351
doesn't mean the rest of us are
blind.

16:43.353 --> 16:45.751
How credible is Jack Marshall as a
suspect?

16:45.753 --> 16:48.591
Strong links to Danny, he doesn't
have an alibi for the night.

16:48.593 --> 16:51.591
He had Danny's phone in his
possession. Who else is a possible?

16:51.593 --> 16:54.511
The Dad - Mark. Very quick to lie
about where he was.

16:54.513 --> 16:58.871
Had an alibi all set to go. Even now
there's still two hours missing from
his alibi.

16:58.873 --> 17:01.271
He used to hit Danny, according to
Miller's son.

17:01.273 --> 17:04.473
Occasionally, not all the time.
Think it's possible?

17:05.153 --> 17:07.991
Maybe. I don't know.
You've changed your tune.

17:08.492 --> 17:13.371
Then there's Paul Coates - local
vicar, no alibi. Taught Danny about
computers.

17:13.373 --> 17:17.330
Er... church overlooks the back
of the Latimer house.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.553
We're running background.
Tread carefully.

17:19.585 --> 17:21.502
We can do without offending the
Church.

17:21.505 --> 17:23.185
Better hope it's not him, then.

17:25.625 --> 17:29.823
You are a year behind your
projections with no sign of an
upturn.

17:29.825 --> 17:34.503
And your... income forecast
compared with your real income...

17:34.505 --> 17:36.505
Stinks, right?

17:36.985 --> 17:39.743
You've seen what the weather's been
like and now...

17:39.745 --> 17:44.265
The bank are demanding a repayment
of ten grand within 42 days or they
repossess.

17:44.985 --> 17:47.185
Beth?

17:47.425 --> 17:51.103
Beth, I didn't expect to see you.
Do you want a drink?

17:51.105 --> 17:53.103
What?

17:53.105 --> 17:55.105
OK, that's enough.

17:55.665 --> 17:57.665
For Christ's sake!

17:58.265 --> 18:02.065
All right, that's enough. Enough.
I'm doing your windows next.

18:02.305 --> 18:04.263
Stop throwing crisps. Stop
throwing...

18:04.265 --> 18:06.103
I've got five flavours to get
through.

18:06.105 --> 18:08.703
I'm sorry, it was a mistake.
Too right it was.

18:08.705 --> 18:13.703
My husband! Cos I will nail you to
the floor before I let you wreck 15
years of my life!

18:13.705 --> 18:16.823
I am sorry. If we'd known what was
gonna... Don't you dare.

18:16.825 --> 18:19.223
Don't you dare bring that into it.

18:19.225 --> 18:22.545
Come near my family again
and I'll break your fucking face.

18:23.025 --> 18:25.385
OK. Understood.

18:25.785 --> 18:27.703
Let's get some air.
Know what she did?

18:27.705 --> 18:29.705
I'm getting the gist.

18:50.105 --> 18:54.000
That's not my article. You rewrote
the whole bloody thing, stoked it
up.

18:54.005 --> 18:55.923
Made it all emotive.

18:55.925 --> 18:57.603
You loaded it against him.

18:57.605 --> 19:01.603
'I restructured it so it had enough
bite for you to get a front-page
byline.

19:01.605 --> 19:03.283
What are you complaining about?'

19:03.285 --> 19:06.123
It's a misrepresentation.
People here will think I wrote that.

19:06.125 --> 19:09.323
'Take your head out of your backside
and get more on Jack Marshall.

19:09.325 --> 19:12.563
What's his history?
What do his neighbours think of him?

19:12.565 --> 19:14.645
You're ahead of the pack. Keep
going.'

19:15.645 --> 19:18.403
You could make a complaint to them.
Would that stop them?

19:18.405 --> 19:20.165
Honestly? No.

19:21.325 --> 19:25.643
But... if you co-operate with us a
bit more we can clear you of all
suspicion.

19:25.645 --> 19:27.403
You think I haven't heard that
before?

19:27.405 --> 19:30.883
"Co-operate and we'll make it all
right." Next thing I'm being
charged.

19:30.885 --> 19:34.085
All I want is to get to the truth
of Danny Latimer's death.

19:39.765 --> 19:43.285
I used to be in the Sea Brigade.
Jack Marshall threw me out.

19:44.605 --> 19:46.643
You're kidding? Why?

19:46.645 --> 19:48.963
He was always wanting hugs from the
boys.

19:48.965 --> 19:52.965
And he'd love us getting in our
trunks when it was hot.

19:53.165 --> 19:56.003
That's when he'd come round,
put his arm on our shoulder.

19:56.005 --> 19:59.325
I was like, "No, thanks, mate. No
hugs from me."

20:00.405 --> 20:03.245
Hm... didn't like me after that.

20:03.805 --> 20:05.805
Kept asking what was wrong with me.

20:09.365 --> 20:11.405
Why are you looking at me like that?

20:57.125 --> 21:00.243
I need this corroborated.
I can't just take your word for it.

21:00.245 --> 21:03.205
Show her. I had him do a list. I
knew you'd ask.

21:05.325 --> 21:07.325
Er...

21:07.405 --> 21:10.805
Three lads who were there
the same time as I was.

21:11.525 --> 21:14.005
Numbers all there.
You came prepared.

21:15.045 --> 21:18.043
Are you sure about this?
We all know what he's like.

21:18.045 --> 21:20.003
And the police are doing nothing.

21:20.005 --> 21:23.443
When we've finished here you need
to put this in a statement to the
police.

21:23.445 --> 21:26.925
But you're gonna use it?
Everyone's gonna know what Jack did.

21:28.725 --> 21:30.923
You said if I ever needed
anything...

21:30.925 --> 21:33.045
Yeah, of course. People need to
know.

21:38.725 --> 21:41.525
I wanted to apologise. Not to her -
to you.

21:42.485 --> 21:45.723
I can't believe I did it. I can - I
can believe it.

21:45.725 --> 21:48.723
God, it felt good.
Do you think I'll have to pay her?

21:48.725 --> 21:50.803
I'm not paying her.
She can whistle for that.

21:50.805 --> 21:52.805
Beth.

21:53.445 --> 21:56.723
Have you thought about maybe seeing
a bereavement counsellor?

21:56.725 --> 21:59.043
I don't want to see a counsellor.

21:59.045 --> 22:01.563
A counsellor will want me to stop
being angry.

22:01.565 --> 22:03.525
I need my anger. It's all I've got.

22:09.045 --> 22:13.605
Mark knows about the pregnancy.
He said I had to keep it.

22:15.325 --> 22:16.763
I think he's right.

22:16.765 --> 22:19.483
Well, if the men think that's what's
best let's do it.

22:19.485 --> 22:23.323
I hate it... this thing growing
inside me.

22:23.325 --> 22:27.003
I don't want it. It's not right.
Danny should be growing.

22:27.005 --> 22:29.285
I'm not done with him. I want him.

22:30.645 --> 22:35.685
I had one job as his mum -
get him ready for the world.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.963
Set him up to meet it and be the
best he could be,

22:38.965 --> 22:40.963
and I failed him. I let him down.

22:40.965 --> 22:43.643
No, you didn't. He was taken.
Why?

22:43.645 --> 22:47.123
Why did your God create him
and then take him back?

22:47.125 --> 22:48.925
I don't know.

22:50.845 --> 22:54.045
Some people think that he takes
those he loves the most first.

22:55.005 --> 22:57.005
Pretty bloody selfish God.

22:57.765 --> 22:59.765
I don't know the reasons.

23:00.485 --> 23:04.003
I just know that this is the life we
have and we have to accept that.

23:04.005 --> 23:07.245
Why? Why should I accept this?

23:08.125 --> 23:10.443
What did I do wrong?
Why am I being punished?

23:10.445 --> 23:12.965
I don't know. I don't know. I wish I
did.

23:19.325 --> 23:21.325
Yeah!

23:22.365 --> 23:25.563
Everybody I know is stopping their
kids from doing their paper round.

23:25.565 --> 23:28.963
Andy's getting up a petition - get
him chucked out of the Sea Brigade.

23:28.965 --> 23:31.445
Maybe we should wait until we know a
bit more.

23:31.725 --> 23:34.043
- What if it's too late by then?
- Whee!

23:34.045 --> 23:37.565
You don't know it's Jack Marshall.
You don't know it ain't.

23:51.285 --> 23:53.285
Hello, boy.

23:56.045 --> 23:59.685
He likes you. Don't normally like
kids.

24:00.445 --> 24:02.285
What's his name?
Vince.

24:03.165 --> 24:05.845
Are you not playing?
Nah. Spent all my money.

24:07.605 --> 24:10.243
You can take him for a walk sometime
if you like.

24:10.245 --> 24:12.803
Really?
I'm over at the caravan park.

24:12.805 --> 24:15.725
Three back from the beach.
Number three on the door.

24:17.565 --> 24:19.803
You can knock for him whenever you
want.

24:19.805 --> 24:21.843
OK.

24:21.845 --> 24:24.763
What's your name?
Tom... Miller.

24:24.765 --> 24:27.885
Nice to meet you, Tom. I'm Susan.

24:29.925 --> 24:32.683
Right, then. Come on. Up you get.
Good boy.

24:32.685 --> 24:34.685
Good boy.

24:35.165 --> 24:37.165
Three back from the beach.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.493
Jack! Jack!

25:19.143 --> 25:21.943
Did this one get rewritten too?
No, that's all me.

25:21.972 --> 25:25.252
It's all true. Dean and Chloe came
to us. Well, her - Karen.

25:25.812 --> 25:28.290
No wonder your boss couldn't resist
it.

25:28.292 --> 25:30.532
It's a good story. I wish it wasn't.

25:31.252 --> 25:34.490
You've brought a shit-fight frenzy
down on us now.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.492
Not me. Jack Marshall.

25:38.012 --> 25:40.092
Jack, Jack!

25:40.852 --> 25:42.852
Back you go, gents.

25:44.612 --> 25:47.730
How is this allowed to happen?
I need police protection.

25:47.732 --> 25:50.450
I'm under siege.
Has anyone threatened you?

25:50.452 --> 25:52.452
Physically intimidated you?

25:53.012 --> 25:55.610
Did you not see that lot? I'm under
siege.

25:55.612 --> 25:59.012
Just stay inside. Bit of luck it
will all abate soon enough.

25:59.772 --> 26:03.652
Stay inside? That's it? You get 'em
away from here. I've a shop to run.

26:03.732 --> 26:06.690
Well, not today.
You're doing this deliberately.

26:06.692 --> 26:10.730
Seeing if I'll crack. You've got me
marked and nothing will make any
difference.

26:10.732 --> 26:14.212
We don't work like that. But you
have kept things back from us.

26:20.972 --> 26:22.972
I...

26:23.492 --> 26:26.572
I was a music teacher. She was a
pupil.

26:27.852 --> 26:29.572
No boys involved. A girl.

26:30.452 --> 26:32.490
I'm sure you can fill in the gaps.

26:32.492 --> 26:34.410
You had sex with a pupil?

26:34.412 --> 26:37.132
I had a relationship.
Who made the first move?

26:37.772 --> 26:39.772
It was a mutual attraction.

26:41.052 --> 26:43.052
And you had sex how many times?

26:43.812 --> 26:45.730
You think I put notches on my
bedpost?

26:45.732 --> 26:47.610
Who told the police?

26:47.612 --> 26:50.770
Her father. I was made an example
of.

26:50.772 --> 26:52.810
Served a year.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.812
I was lucky to make it out alive.

26:59.132 --> 27:01.612
She was 15 years and 11 months.

27:03.532 --> 27:07.212
Another four weeks and one day
and nothing would have been amiss.

27:07.852 --> 27:09.770
I served my time.

27:09.772 --> 27:13.452
For God's sake. You should have told
us this, when we first asked.

27:14.772 --> 27:16.810
It was nobody's business but mine.

27:16.812 --> 27:20.332
Did you have any contact with the
girl after you were released?

27:21.572 --> 27:24.972
I married her, the week after I was
released.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.492
She was 17, I was 40.

27:35.652 --> 27:38.690
What are you doing to protect Jack?
Why is it your business?

27:38.692 --> 27:41.650
He's my parishioner. He's terrified.
We've been over to him.

27:41.652 --> 27:44.650
We're trying to keep the press at
bay. You're not doing a good job.

27:44.652 --> 27:48.370
There is an innocent man being
hounded and you need to do something
about it.

27:48.372 --> 27:50.572
You're certain he's innocent, are
you?

27:51.892 --> 27:53.930
You're certain he's not?

27:53.932 --> 27:55.732
Your concern's noted.

27:58.612 --> 28:02.570
What Marshall said doesn't alter the
fact. He has a conviction, and is a
suspect.

28:02.572 --> 28:05.970
We can't be distracted by him or
this press. We persevere with
evidence.

28:05.972 --> 28:07.972
Are we on?
Yes.

28:10.972 --> 28:14.170
Four similar cigarette butts
all within three feet of one another,

28:14.172 --> 28:17.250
within four feet
of where the boy's body was found.

28:17.252 --> 28:19.130
What makes them special?
Timing.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.410
If they'd been there
more than a few hours earlier

28:21.412 --> 28:23.210
they'd have been washed away by the
tide.

28:23.212 --> 28:26.770
But there's no traces of tide water
on them. They were left there that
morning

28:26.772 --> 28:29.010
about the same time the body was.

28:29.012 --> 28:32.970
Is that a common brand? High tar.
It's quite unusual these days.

28:32.972 --> 28:34.850
If they were bought locally,

28:34.852 --> 28:38.210
you might be in with a shout
of people remembering the purchaser.

28:38.212 --> 28:40.492
Four cigarettes?
What's the matter?

28:41.772 --> 28:45.570
All that way to drop off a body and
then stand and smoke. Doesn't make
sense.

28:45.572 --> 28:47.852
The important thing is, who smokes
them?

28:57.612 --> 29:00.730
You can't live without me, can you?
I ain't staying.

29:00.732 --> 29:03.212
There's things happening that I need
to see to.

29:03.572 --> 29:06.372
So I want you to take that and go.
What's that?

29:07.452 --> 29:09.570
500 quid.

29:09.572 --> 29:12.412
500? Is that what I'm worth?

29:12.892 --> 29:14.652
It's all I could get.

29:16.212 --> 29:20.530
You see that van? I got a crossbow
in that van. I ain't messing about.

29:20.532 --> 29:23.732
We need to find a way
of working this out... together.

29:44.932 --> 29:47.052
Who's the boy I saw you with last
night?

29:50.692 --> 29:54.892
And don't mess me about, Chloe, cos
we are way beyond that in this house
now.

29:57.052 --> 29:59.052
His name's Dean.
Dean.

29:59.372 --> 30:02.530
Why didn't you tell us you had a
boyfriend? Like the last two times?

30:02.532 --> 30:05.250
How old is he?
Do we have to do this now?

30:05.252 --> 30:07.732
Yes, we do. I'm sick of not knowing
things.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.852
17.
17?

30:13.172 --> 30:16.490
And he's going out with a
15-year-old? Yes. Just like you did
with Mum.

30:16.492 --> 30:19.130
Don't get smart with me.
Just ask me, Dad.

30:19.132 --> 30:21.570
Fine! Are you having sex with him?
Yes!

30:21.572 --> 30:24.210
We use condoms,
which is more than you and Mum did.

30:24.212 --> 30:27.650
I'm not having you talk to me like
that, Chloe. I got you out of a
police cell!

30:27.652 --> 30:31.970
I saw how you and Becca Fisher were
looking at each other. Want to talk
about that too?

30:31.972 --> 30:34.010
You flirting in front of my eyes

30:34.012 --> 30:36.892
whilst I was doing shifts at the
Traders and you...

30:41.892 --> 30:43.890
Sea Brigade, Jack Marshall.

30:43.892 --> 30:48.212
I got a call from one of the other
dads. They're rounding up a posse to
get him.

31:00.772 --> 31:02.972
Request for backup at Sea Brigade
hall.

31:03.252 --> 31:06.290
Paedo! All right, lads, let's
not be daft here.

31:06.292 --> 31:08.090
We're here to talk with Jack.

31:08.092 --> 31:11.130
There's no meeting here tonight.
No boys are coming here, Jack.

31:11.132 --> 31:14.250
We don't want you near our kids.
We don't feel safe with that.

31:14.252 --> 31:17.770
You don't have kids, Nigel. You
didn't even get a badge for knots.

31:17.772 --> 31:19.690
Yeah? I can speak for those that do.

31:19.692 --> 31:22.330
Not really, Nige.

31:22.332 --> 31:24.170
All right, boys.
Criminal!

31:24.172 --> 31:26.010
Mate.
Get away, come on.

31:26.012 --> 31:27.650
Get back!

31:27.652 --> 31:30.372
You don't need to be involved.
Get back!

31:35.652 --> 31:37.652
You're a dead man!
Do it, Mark.

31:38.732 --> 31:40.732
All right, Nige.

31:41.612 --> 31:44.170
A lot of people saying
a lot of stuff about you, Jack.

31:44.172 --> 31:47.970
I'm not what they're calling me
and... I didn't go near your boy.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.972
You had Dan's phone.

31:50.692 --> 31:53.612
He left it in the bottom of his
delivery bag, I swear.

31:54.252 --> 31:56.572
You've been to prison, though, ain't
you?

31:58.412 --> 32:00.412
Hey?

32:01.812 --> 32:05.452
There was a girl. We had an affair.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.532
She was 15, nearly 16.

32:09.932 --> 32:11.932
Same age as Beth when you met her.

32:13.612 --> 32:15.612
Mark.

32:16.332 --> 32:18.332
We married, we had a son together.

32:20.532 --> 32:23.692
Yeah, where is he now, then?
Why ain't he with you now?

32:26.932 --> 32:30.572
He died, aged six. Car accident.

32:31.252 --> 32:33.252
She was driving.

32:34.572 --> 32:39.092
The grief ripped us apart, so I came
here. Fresh start.

32:43.332 --> 32:47.012
They're saying I wanted to hug the
boys because I'm a paedophile.

32:48.572 --> 32:51.532
It was never that. I missed my boy.

32:52.452 --> 32:55.612
I missed touching him, holding him.

32:57.812 --> 32:59.812
I miss my boy every day.

33:07.892 --> 33:09.850
What sort of world is this, Mark,

33:09.852 --> 33:12.212
where it's wrong for a man to seek
affection?

33:13.412 --> 33:15.812
I would never harm Danny.

33:16.652 --> 33:21.012
We're the same, Mark. No parent
should outlive their child.

33:25.372 --> 33:27.372
Your boy, he...

33:28.492 --> 33:30.492
he was a good boy.

33:35.452 --> 33:37.490
Mark, you OK?

33:37.492 --> 33:39.610
- Yeah. Go home, boys.
- What's he saying?

33:39.612 --> 33:42.092
Go home now! The lot of you!

33:45.332 --> 33:47.932
You're dead, mate. Dead!

33:48.292 --> 33:50.292
Come on.

33:57.292 --> 34:00.172
You should get away from here, Jack.
It's not safe.

34:01.092 --> 34:03.092
This is my home now.

34:03.532 --> 34:05.532
People have made up their minds.

34:08.891 --> 34:12.371
If you want to stay safe I'd get as
far away from here as you can.

34:32.347 --> 34:35.007
Why down here? I thought we'd
be going to the harbour.

34:35.012 --> 34:37.929
No, it's a dry dock.
Posh name for "we keep it here".

34:37.931 --> 34:41.370
How come you've got a boat, anyway?

34:41.371 --> 34:44.371
Er... it was my dad's.
And then he left a few years ago.

34:44.692 --> 34:48.411
We used to go out in it, but after
he went I never fancied it so much.

34:48.931 --> 34:50.969
How did your mum cope when he left?

34:50.972 --> 34:52.972
She didn't.

34:58.212 --> 35:00.250
Which one is it?

35:00.252 --> 35:03.012
It's not here. It's gone.

35:04.772 --> 35:07.090
When did you last see the boat?
Eight weeks ago.

35:07.092 --> 35:09.130
The whole thing?
The motor and everything.

35:09.132 --> 35:11.290
Why'd you leave the motor on it?
Dad always did.

35:11.292 --> 35:13.330
And I always told him not to.

35:13.332 --> 35:15.730
Do you think it could be the boat
that was burned?

35:15.732 --> 35:20.050
It's late, Oliver. Thank you for
reporting it. I've given a picture
to SOCO. Leave it with me.

35:20.052 --> 35:23.410
You can go now. But if you find it
was, can I have the story?

35:23.412 --> 35:25.370
Don't announce it, give it to me.

35:25.372 --> 35:28.532
If was our boat - my boat. Dad's
boat.

36:24.332 --> 36:26.810
Ellie? Oh, God, Brian, I just want
to go home.

36:26.812 --> 36:29.650
That picture you got of the boat
it's a match with what we have.

36:29.652 --> 36:32.572
The colour, the moulding -
it could be the one. We'll confirm.

36:34.236 --> 36:37.394
Right. Good. Sort of. And we got
Danny's DNA on the burnt boat,

36:37.396 --> 36:39.196
so if it's a match we're there, we
got it.

36:40.996 --> 36:43.036
OK.
Listen.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.676
Do you fancy a drink one night?

36:47.556 --> 36:50.754
Sorry, I'm married, Brian.
That's an issue, is it?

36:50.756 --> 36:54.396
Happily married, Brian.
Oh. OK. Fair enough.

36:55.876 --> 36:58.434
Only lots of people aren't, are
they? I am.

36:58.436 --> 37:00.114
Good.

37:00.116 --> 37:02.116
Well, there we go.

37:03.236 --> 37:05.994
Do you need anything from the
kitchen? A cup of tea or...

37:05.996 --> 37:07.996
No, I'm fine. Thanks, though.

37:20.116 --> 37:23.794
Erm... the burned boat. Bit weird.

37:23.796 --> 37:27.356
Erm... the boat itself was my
ex-brother-in-law's.

37:29.316 --> 37:31.554
Yeah, I know. Bit of a surprise,
Olly's dad.

37:31.556 --> 37:34.876
He's been gone a while. Left my
sister a couple of years ago.

37:35.996 --> 37:39.994
The boat that was burned, that has
Danny's DNA on it, was your
brother's?

37:39.996 --> 37:44.554
Yeah. It was just left, just off the
beach, with the motor chained to it.

37:44.556 --> 37:47.836
I mean, anyone could have taken it,
just use bolt cutters.

37:48.156 --> 37:51.436
Who knew it was there?
Everyone did. It wasn't a secret.

37:52.716 --> 37:54.754
Your son Tom, did he know?

37:54.756 --> 37:57.074
Yeah. Why?
Did Danny?

37:57.076 --> 37:58.796
I don't know.

38:00.556 --> 38:05.634
All right, well, see if forensics
can get any other prints or DNA off
the shards,

38:05.636 --> 38:08.196
match them against all the
elimination prints.

38:10.916 --> 38:13.074
Oh, and erm... funny thing.

38:13.076 --> 38:17.436
I had to tell someone.
Erm... SOCO Brian just asked me out.

38:18.316 --> 38:20.796
Brian? Why would he do that?
Thanks a lot.

38:21.436 --> 38:24.476
You're married. I told him that, but
it didn't seem to faze him.

38:25.916 --> 38:28.274
Flattering?
Well, sort of.

38:28.276 --> 38:30.714
But it's SOCO,
they've had their hands everywhere.

38:30.716 --> 38:32.716
Dirty Brian.
Yeah.

38:37.996 --> 38:41.116
Sir, do you think we'll get them,
the killer? We will.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.356
You didn't on Sandbrook.

38:52.196 --> 38:54.754
How long you been waiting to bring
that up? I haven't.

38:54.756 --> 38:56.756
Sandbrook was different.

38:57.756 --> 39:01.476
Did you get it wrong? Wow. You
really have been bottling this up.

39:03.596 --> 39:06.914
You think you've been lumbered with
a senior office not fit for purpose?

39:06.916 --> 39:09.876
I don't know. It all got hushed up.
I didn't want that.

39:14.676 --> 39:18.916
A mistake was made. A big mistake.

39:21.996 --> 39:23.996
By you?

39:25.156 --> 39:27.156
I don't want to talk about it.

39:31.356 --> 39:35.116
These are my friends, people I've
known all my life. We can't let them
down.

39:35.356 --> 39:37.396
We won't.

39:59.876 --> 40:03.754
'..UK Border Agency is described as
a troubled organisation

40:03.756 --> 40:05.996
which will take years to turn round.

40:06.396 --> 40:13.156
People who have abused their
position in this country to commit
offences and who are...'

40:14.156 --> 40:16.156
Can we not listen to the news?

40:24.356 --> 40:27.196
You know I love you, Beth.
I know you say it.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.556
Since you've been caught out.

40:34.116 --> 40:36.556
Did Danny know about you and Becca?
No.

40:38.556 --> 40:40.556
No, he didn't. I swear.

40:43.476 --> 40:45.316
Beth, please.

40:46.556 --> 40:49.594
Why don't we make an agreement,
just for tonight, eh?

40:49.596 --> 40:51.596
No bickering and no silences.

40:53.596 --> 40:55.716
Let's just find something else.

41:02.356 --> 41:03.674
Hi.
Hi.

41:03.676 --> 41:06.514
I saw you come in, I know it's late.
You don't mind, do you?

41:06.516 --> 41:08.116
No, it's fine. Come in.

41:10.316 --> 41:12.074
So, here's an issue.

41:12.076 --> 41:15.554
I've just got journalists and press
photographers asking me about rooms,

41:15.556 --> 41:19.714
and I know you don't want to bump
into them in the corridor and I
wouldn't normally ask...

41:19.716 --> 41:23.354
It's just that my usual holiday
bookings, they've cancelled,

41:23.356 --> 41:26.354
and I'm not gonna make it
to next spring at this rate, so...

41:26.356 --> 41:28.754
What are you asking me?
I wanted to suggest a deal.

41:28.756 --> 41:30.754
You give me a pass on the
journalists

41:30.756 --> 41:34.074
and I will charge the police
half the usual rate for your room.

41:34.076 --> 41:38.396
You like my company that much?
I've had worse guests.

41:40.876 --> 41:43.514
It must be a bloody hard job running
this place.

41:43.516 --> 41:45.516
You have no idea.

41:47.116 --> 41:49.116
How do you relax?

41:49.716 --> 41:51.716
I have my ways.

41:52.756 --> 41:54.556
Hm.

41:55.236 --> 41:57.076
Would you...

42:00.956 --> 42:03.076
Do you want to relax a bit with me,
here?

42:03.596 --> 42:05.074
Tonight?
God, no!

42:05.076 --> 42:07.594
No, I mean, it's not what I meant.
Good. Sorry.

42:07.596 --> 42:10.434
It's not that I wouldn't, or that
you're... No, no. Of course.

42:10.436 --> 42:12.716
It's just...
I'd... I'd be worried.

42:14.196 --> 42:18.116
Worried?
That you'd... collapse on me.

42:20.436 --> 42:22.116
Right. Thanks.

42:26.956 --> 42:29.196
I'm really sorry about the
misunderstanding.

42:51.356 --> 42:53.396
Yeah...

43:01.876 --> 43:04.396
He was obsessed with rockets, wasn't
he? Mm-hm.
