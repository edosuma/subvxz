WEBVTT

02:06.935 --> 02:08.269
That was
Bobby Lewis

02:08.353 --> 02:09.895
with "Tossin' and Turnin'"
hitting number one for the

02:09.979 --> 02:11.314
second week in a row.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.024
And now here's a little
something for the Bronx Bombers.

02:14.818 --> 02:16.861
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

02:16.945 --> 02:18.697
and welcome to Crosley Field for
game three

02:18.780 --> 02:20.907
of the 1961 World Series between
the

02:20.991 --> 02:22.701
American League champions,

02:22.784 --> 02:24.202
the New York Yankees,

02:24.285 --> 02:28.248
and the National League
champions, YOURRR Cincinnati

02:28.331 --> 02:29.916
Reds!

02:30.000 --> 02:32.544
Cincinnati, the very
cradle of

02:32.627 --> 02:35.547
professional baseball since 1868
and has been a

02:35.630 --> 02:37.549
baseball hotbed ever since.

02:37.632 --> 02:39.718
And no fans anywhere are more
enthusiastic than

02:39.801 --> 02:41.553
these now converging on Crosley
Field.

02:41.636 --> 02:43.722
They're announcing the teams.

02:43.805 --> 02:47.058
Mickey Mantle, wearing number 7,
suffering from a hip wound, will

02:47.142 --> 02:49.102
make his first appearance in
this series.

02:49.185 --> 02:50.103
It's Mick.

02:50.186 --> 02:51.896
A courageous performer.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.565
Batting in fourth place and

02:53.648 --> 02:55.066
playing right field,
wearing number 9,

02:55.150 --> 02:57.235
It's Maris.
Announcer: the holder of the

02:57.319 --> 02:59.571
single season home run record,
Roger Maris.

02:59.654 --> 03:03.742
And there go the Reds, and the
fight for the series lead is on.

03:08.204 --> 03:12.083
I'm afraid the fever has
left young William deaf.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.961
Doc, there has to be
something you can do.

03:15.045 --> 03:17.130
I'm sorry.

03:20.342 --> 03:21.926
It's gonna be okay.

03:23.553 --> 03:26.056
It's gonna be okay.

03:38.193 --> 03:40.779
Why, Rebecca, it's
mighty good to see you.

03:40.862 --> 03:44.532
Thank you, Mabel.
Ruth, it's nice to see you as well.

03:45.033 --> 03:46.951
We have to get
together soon.

03:47.035 --> 03:48.953
I look forward to
that.

03:52.207 --> 03:56.169
You best stop makin'
fun of my brother.

03:56.252 --> 03:57.379
Whatcha gonna do?

03:57.462 --> 03:59.297
You keep it up and
you'll see.

04:02.592 --> 04:07.972
Boys! William!

04:08.056 --> 04:11.643
Boys!
Knock it off right now.

04:11.726 --> 04:13.478
What are you doin'?

04:13.561 --> 04:14.646
They started it, Pa.

04:14.729 --> 04:16.147
I don't care who
started it.

04:16.231 --> 04:17.607
You know fighting is never the
answer.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.524
But Pa!

04:18.607 --> 04:19.565
There's no "But Pa."

04:19.651 --> 04:21.486
You know what, everybody get in
the

04:21.569 --> 04:23.154
wagon right now.
Let's go.

04:23.238 --> 04:24.864
- Rebecca, dear, may
- I

04:24.948 --> 04:26.032
suggest you leave

04:26.116 --> 04:28.368
the young deaf and dumb boy on
the farm.

04:28.451 --> 04:29.661
Excuse me?

04:29.744 --> 04:30.996
Well, it's just
that...

04:31.079 --> 04:32.872
No, Mabel, you
don't need to explain.

04:32.956 --> 04:38.503
We... we don't
need a circus in town.

04:43.091 --> 04:45.510
You boys be careful
with

04:45.593 --> 04:46.594
your brother.

04:46.678 --> 04:48.680
Ah, Ma, Will can hold
his own.

04:48.763 --> 04:49.806
You saw him.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.349
You hold your
tongue, boy.

04:51.433 --> 04:55.395
Yes, ma'am.
C'mon, guys, leave

04:55.478 --> 04:56.604
him alone.

04:56.688 --> 05:01.026
Will, no.
You cannot do that.

05:01.109 --> 05:03.028
Do you understand?

05:03.111 --> 05:05.196
You boys should grow
up.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.032
What do you know
about growin' up?

05:07.115 --> 05:09.200
I heard you, Frank.
That's no

05:09.284 --> 05:10.744
way to talk to your sister.

05:10.827 --> 05:13.872
She started it.
C'mon, let's go do something.

05:13.955 --> 05:15.081
All right.
All right.

05:15.165 --> 05:16.416
Go ahead.

05:16.499 --> 05:18.209
Go have fun, but stay out of
trouble, all right?

05:18.293 --> 05:24.090
- Yes, sir.
- All right?

05:24.174 --> 05:26.217
They're boys, Ma.

05:26.301 --> 05:27.469
My goodness.

05:27.552 --> 05:29.929
I know, but I worry
so about Will.

05:30.013 --> 05:31.556
You gotta let him be
a boy.

05:31.639 --> 05:32.891
You
can't keep him on the farm

05:32.974 --> 05:34.434
forever, honey. Come
on.

05:34.517 --> 05:35.894
Well, what are we
gonna do?

05:35.977 --> 05:37.729
We take him into town and
everybody laughs at him.

05:37.812 --> 05:38.730
Ah.

05:38.813 --> 05:39.648
They laugh at all
of us.

05:39.731 --> 05:40.565
You don't mind those
people.

05:40.649 --> 05:42.067
That's just them being ignorant.

05:42.150 --> 05:44.235
What about them
fighting with

05:44.319 --> 05:45.320
the other boys?

05:45.403 --> 05:47.072
You know, I'll sit 'em
down,

05:47.155 --> 05:49.908
I'll remind 'em that fighting is
never the answer.

05:49.991 --> 05:53.411
Okay? Come on.

05:53.495 --> 05:55.246
Well, what about
his schooling?

05:55.330 --> 05:56.748
You know, how is he ever going
to get

05:56.831 --> 05:58.917
an education if the school
doesn't even want him to attend?

05:59.501 --> 06:01.252
Well, why don't we go
check out

06:01.336 --> 06:03.630
that school in Columbus that the
doc told us about?

06:03.713 --> 06:06.675
He'll be with... he'll be with
other kids just like him.

06:07.342 --> 06:08.927
But it's so far.

06:09.010 --> 06:12.263
Well, we'll go look
at it.

06:12.347 --> 06:13.765
What do
you say?

06:13.848 --> 06:16.267
Come on, now.

06:16.351 --> 06:18.269
You're such a blessing, you know
that?

06:18.353 --> 06:20.021
Ooh, my goodness, yes, you are.

07:06.401 --> 07:10.488
Good job.

07:39.934 --> 07:43.438
Get back
to work.

08:03.333 --> 08:06.461
You're
up to bat.

08:07.962 --> 08:08.963
Come
on, let's go!

08:10.465 --> 08:12.300
What?
What is it?

08:12.801 --> 08:15.136
Stop.
Everyone, come in here.

08:21.476 --> 08:23.728
I'd like
to play baseball.

08:23.812 --> 08:26.398
You
want to play baseball?

08:27.023 --> 08:29.192
Yes.

08:30.694 --> 08:36.073
You're
too small.

08:36.157 --> 08:38.243
And too skinny.

08:38.326 --> 08:40.745
I want to
play.

08:40.828 --> 08:43.248
Okay.
Let's see what you got.

08:43.331 --> 08:46.167
You bat
first.

08:55.677 --> 09:00.432
Nope.
Move back.

09:00.515 --> 09:01.349
There.

09:03.184 --> 09:06.771
Put
your hands closer together

09:06.855 --> 09:08.648
and spread your feet apart.

09:08.732 --> 09:10.900
Back a
little more.

09:18.700 --> 09:19.909
You
have to swing at the ball.

09:39.220 --> 09:42.682
Three strikes, you're
out, kid.

09:42.766 --> 09:45.644
Let's see if you can
catch a ball.

09:45.727 --> 09:47.228
Take the field.

09:57.572 --> 09:59.824
Yes,
right there.

09:59.908 --> 10:02.077
He is going to hit the ball to
you.

10:17.258 --> 10:22.138
You'll
never make it.

10:34.776 --> 10:39.114
Good job.
Be careful.

11:28.330 --> 11:31.750
It's time to
come in.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.168
Give it to me.

11:53.521 --> 11:56.691
I've
been watching you.

11:59.361 --> 12:01.613
You've
been watching me?

12:01.696 --> 12:06.284
Yes.
For months.

12:06.368 --> 12:07.827
Why?

12:07.911 --> 12:10.121
You
want to play baseball, right?

12:10.205 --> 12:11.164
That's
right.

12:11.247 --> 12:12.957
You
can't.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.292
You're
too small.

12:14.376 --> 12:17.128
You
already told me that.

12:17.712 --> 12:20.799
You're
going to

12:20.882 --> 12:24.135
get a lot of that.
People will tease you.

12:24.219 --> 12:29.849
You need to be better
than everyone.

12:29.933 --> 12:35.480
It doesn't matter if you are
small or deaf.

12:35.563 --> 12:38.358
The great thing about
us being deaf

12:38.441 --> 12:41.319
is that we don't have to hear
what they say.

12:41.403 --> 12:44.656
You can stay
completely focused.

12:44.739 --> 12:47.409
Let me show you how I
practice throwing strikes.

13:03.591 --> 13:07.721
When
you can hit that

13:07.804 --> 13:12.934
square consistently, that's when
you know you're good.

13:13.768 --> 13:14.769
Watch.

13:24.612 --> 13:26.698
Better
than

13:26.781 --> 13:27.949
anyone.
Understand?

13:58.146 --> 13:59.397
I think
you're ready.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.903
The team is going to
be barnstorming across Ohio

14:04.986 --> 14:06.237
and the Midwest.

14:06.321 --> 14:08.740
We need one more
player.

14:08.823 --> 14:10.158
What do you say? h

14:11.326 --> 14:18.166
We're called the Ohio
Independents.

14:32.722 --> 14:34.516
Come on, run!
Let's go!

14:34.599 --> 14:35.433
Let's go!
Run!

15:11.886 --> 15:18.184
Safe!

15:18.268 --> 15:25.483
Good game.

15:25.567 --> 15:29.863
I
taught you well.

15:29.946 --> 15:33.158
We just beat a very good team.

15:33.241 --> 15:37.704
You deaf boys
play pretty good.

15:37.787 --> 15:42.917
White boys usually don't
normally shake our hands.

15:53.762 --> 15:56.848
Hearing boys usually
don't tell us we

15:56.931 --> 16:00.352
play pretty good, so I guess
that makes us equal.

16:00.435 --> 16:06.274
Yes, I guess it
does.

16:44.980 --> 16:51.069
1 John 4:7,8 tells us,
"Beloved, let

16:51.152 --> 16:53.947
us love one another.

16:54.030 --> 16:58.451
For love is of God,
and everyone that loveth is born

16:58.535 --> 16:59.786
of God."

16:59.869 --> 17:04.082
Life is about discovering the
love that God has

17:04.165 --> 17:05.165
for you.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.584
It is about responding to his
love.

17:07.669 --> 17:10.088
It's about loving him in return.

17:11.673 --> 17:16.593
And it is about loving people.

17:16.678 --> 17:21.265
It's as simple as that.
Receive God's love.

17:21.348 --> 17:28.648
Enjoy God's love. Love God.
Love people.

17:28.732 --> 17:33.778
The rest is in the details.

17:33.862 --> 17:38.825
Reasons to come in contact with
people,

17:38.908 --> 17:43.788
every day, so that we may love
them.

17:43.872 --> 17:46.458
And every day is an opportunity
to

17:46.541 --> 17:48.626
love God and love people,

17:48.710 --> 17:52.297
whether they love us back or
not.

17:52.380 --> 17:56.384
If they love you, love them.

17:56.468 --> 17:58.887
If they do not love you,
love them.

17:59.554 --> 18:02.474
Isn't
that the deaf and dumb boy?

18:02.557 --> 18:03.975
I had
heard he came back.

18:04.059 --> 18:05.393
If they are good to
you, love them.

18:05.477 --> 18:07.479
I heard no one wanted him.

18:07.562 --> 18:11.650
If they are bad to
you, love them.

18:11.733 --> 18:17.864
If they hurt you, love them.

18:17.947 --> 18:24.371
If they persecute you, love
them.

18:24.454 --> 18:29.167
If they kill you, love them.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.921
Beloved, let us love one
another.

18:33.004 --> 18:33.838
Amen.

18:40.428 --> 18:45.350
What a
friend we

18:45.433 --> 18:47.519
have in Jesus...

18:47.602 --> 18:49.521
Lord, we thank you
for this food

18:49.604 --> 18:51.022
that we're about to receive.

18:51.106 --> 18:55.193
And also thank you for
William graduating school,

18:55.276 --> 18:59.406
and for all the blessings
you bestowed on the Hoy family.

18:59.489 --> 19:01.700
- Everybody, say amen.
- Amen.

19:01.783 --> 19:04.369
Let's eat.

19:04.452 --> 19:07.205
I talked to Mr.
Beagle today and he was

19:07.288 --> 19:09.207
looking for a helping hand.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.543
Well, fall's
coming.

19:11.626 --> 19:13.211
I'm sure he'll be busy.

19:13.294 --> 19:14.713
Yep.

19:14.796 --> 19:17.549
John, sit up straight.

19:17.632 --> 19:20.885
Yeah, he wanted to ask
if we didn't mind if William

19:20.969 --> 19:24.723
can work for him since he
learned shoemaking in school.

19:24.806 --> 19:26.224
What did you tell
him?

19:26.307 --> 19:28.893
Well, I told him I'd
talk to you first.

19:28.977 --> 19:29.978
Well, I don't think
it's a Untitled

19:30.312 --> 19:31.479
Why not?

19:31.563 --> 19:33.773
He's not ready to
go out in the

19:33.857 --> 19:35.233
hearing world by himself.

19:35.317 --> 19:38.069
Becca.

19:38.153 --> 19:39.821
When would he like
him to start?

19:40.196 --> 19:42.741
In a couple of
months, before fall,

19:42.824 --> 19:45.118
so he can become familiar with
the shop.

19:45.201 --> 19:47.579
Jacob, you know
what will

19:47.662 --> 19:49.748
happen.
It's the same thing over and

19:49.831 --> 19:50.874
over again.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.418
I do not want my son to be
humiliated.

19:53.501 --> 19:55.086
We're not always
gonna be

19:55.170 --> 19:56.254
there to protect him.

19:56.338 --> 19:58.757
I know.
I just don't think

19:58.840 --> 19:59.924
it's a good idea.

20:00.008 --> 20:02.260
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.

20:02.344 --> 20:04.095
I'm takin' the boys into town
tomorrow

20:04.179 --> 20:05.430
to pick up some supplies.

20:05.513 --> 20:07.640
It's a great opportunity to tell
Mr.

20:07.724 --> 20:10.310
Beagle that
William can start as soon as he

20:10.393 --> 20:11.353
needs him.

20:11.436 --> 20:13.605
William can stay
here

20:13.688 --> 20:15.106
with Ora and myself.

20:15.190 --> 20:16.941
Some of the town boys
are

20:17.025 --> 20:18.943
playing baseball and I thought
William

20:19.027 --> 20:22.614
would enjoy watching since he
played a little in school.

20:24.032 --> 20:24.991
What's he saying?

20:27.702 --> 20:31.665
He thought maybe he
could

20:31.748 --> 20:33.291
play baseball.

20:33.375 --> 20:38.463
No, it's not the
kinda game I want

20:38.546 --> 20:43.176
you playing.
I want you focused on work.

20:46.721 --> 20:48.473
Come on, gittup here.
Come on.

20:48.556 --> 20:49.474
Good boy.
There 'ya are

20:49.557 --> 20:56.314
Whoa. That's it. Good boy. Whoa.

21:02.612 --> 21:06.157
How are you, Dave?

21:06.241 --> 21:07.867
Hey, Jacob!
Good to see 'ya.

21:07.951 --> 21:08.785
- Good to see 'ya. Yeah.
- Good to see 'ya.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.829
William, say hello.

21:10.912 --> 21:13.498
Hey, I'm glad he
brought you along, William.

21:13.581 --> 21:15.500
So Rebecca and I
talked it over

21:15.583 --> 21:17.210
and he can start whenever you'd
like.

21:17.293 --> 21:19.170
Well, that's great.
That's just great.

21:19.254 --> 21:20.422
I really appreciate
you bringing him in for work.

21:20.964 --> 21:22.173
Now, when you want to talk to
him,

21:22.257 --> 21:23.675
you gotta look at him square in
the eye

21:23.758 --> 21:25.218
so he can read your lips.

21:25.301 --> 21:26.845
Oh, I'm not gonna
have any problem with that.

21:26.928 --> 21:29.180
I've been having a little
trouble with my own hearing.

21:29.264 --> 21:30.807
And look at these hands.

21:30.890 --> 21:31.725
They've done a lot of work.

21:31.808 --> 21:32.642
But you've got
nothing to worry about.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.185
It's gonna work out well.

21:34.269 --> 21:35.437
Thank you.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.646
What are you boys
all doin' here?

21:36.730 --> 21:38.189
Well, I promised 'em
I'd take 'em

21:38.273 --> 21:39.566
over to watch the baseball game.

21:39.649 --> 21:40.817
That's a good
thing.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.735
I'll see you after.
All right?

21:41.818 --> 21:42.652
All right.

21:42.736 --> 21:43.570
Have a good time,
boys.

21:43.653 --> 21:44.487
Thanks again, Dave.

21:44.571 --> 21:45.405
Pleasure to see
you, Jacob.

21:45.488 --> 21:46.364
Let's go.

21:58.668 --> 22:01.421
Keep it going, boys!

22:01.504 --> 22:03.757
Yeah!
Come on!

22:03.840 --> 22:06.718
All right.
Keep it going, boys!

22:06.801 --> 22:08.720
Keep it going, boys!

22:08.803 --> 22:11.222
Whoa!

22:30.992 --> 22:35.580
So you really wanna
play some baseball?

22:35.664 --> 22:38.750
Son, you gotta build a future.

22:38.833 --> 22:41.628
Playing baseball is no life you
can

22:41.711 --> 22:44.547
hang your hat on.
You understand?

22:48.176 --> 22:49.427
What?
Let me see.

22:49.511 --> 22:52.138
I know you played a little in
school.

22:52.222 --> 22:53.765
You were good, huh?

22:53.848 --> 22:57.102
You even beat some big-time
leaguers?

22:57.185 --> 22:59.646
Son, baseball's for hoodlums.

22:59.729 --> 23:01.982
Maybe one day you can play for
fun,

23:02.065 --> 23:04.484
but it's not gonna get you
anywhere.

23:04.567 --> 23:09.531
Besides, you got a job now.
Come on.

23:10.865 --> 23:15.120
I just don't
understand.

23:15.203 --> 23:19.791
I don't
...I just don't get why nobody's

23:19.874 --> 23:21.251
coming in.

23:24.045 --> 23:26.965
Well, howdy, boys.
How you doin'?

23:27.048 --> 23:28.675
Doin' great, Dave.
Yourself?

23:28.758 --> 23:30.802
Oh, I'm doin' just
fine.

23:30.885 --> 23:32.804
Is there anything I can do for
you?

23:32.887 --> 23:35.181
Well, we got some
shoes here that need fixin'.

23:35.265 --> 23:36.599
Oh, it doesn't...
let me... let me

23:36.683 --> 23:37.517
see these here.
What you got?

23:37.600 --> 23:38.601
You got a... yeah.

23:38.685 --> 23:39.811
See you got that
dumb boy

23:39.894 --> 23:40.854
over there working for you.

23:40.937 --> 23:42.647
Oh, he's a good
cobbler.

23:42.731 --> 23:43.565
Yeah?

23:43.648 --> 23:44.482
Well, if it's all the same to you,

23:44.899 --> 23:47.193
we'd just as soon that you do
the work on

23:47.277 --> 23:48.361
our shoes.

23:48.445 --> 23:50.655
I've been working
for years.

23:50.739 --> 23:52.991
My hands are all givin' away
from it.

23:53.074 --> 23:56.494
That boy over there,
he's a... he's a fine worker

23:56.578 --> 23:57.579
with shoes.

23:57.662 --> 24:00.165
I just don't see
how no

24:00.248 --> 24:02.500
dumb boy can be fixin' no shoes.

24:02.584 --> 24:06.171
Dave, let me give
you a little advice.

24:06.254 --> 24:08.673
Nobody in this town wants their
shoes

24:08.757 --> 24:10.342
fixed up by no dumb boy.

24:10.425 --> 24:14.346
Let me give you a
piece of

24:14.429 --> 24:15.430
advice.

24:15.513 --> 24:19.351
You two boys and this whole town
can ride

24:19.434 --> 24:21.019
a hundred miles

24:21.102 --> 24:25.231
to another town and get your
shoes fixed

24:25.315 --> 24:28.568
or you can let my boy fix 'em,

24:28.652 --> 24:33.365
because one way or another, I
don't give a damn.

24:33.448 --> 24:36.534
You might wanna
rethink that, Dave.

24:36.618 --> 24:37.702
Or close down.

24:37.786 --> 24:41.039
Yeah.
Well, I wouldn't even

24:41.122 --> 24:44.542
give that a thought.
Good to see you.

24:53.134 --> 24:58.223
Hey, what's wrong,
son?

24:58.306 --> 24:59.683
You okay?

25:03.311 --> 25:07.565
Oh.
Am I ashamed of you?

25:07.649 --> 25:14.739
Oh, no.
What made you think a thing like

25:14.823 --> 25:15.907
that?

25:15.991 --> 25:19.619
You read their lips and they
said

25:19.703 --> 25:22.914
they don't want you in town?

25:22.998 --> 25:27.919
Listen to me. To hell with them.
Just to hell with them.

25:28.003 --> 25:30.755
You just keep doin' you a fine
job and

25:30.839 --> 25:32.257
they'll come back.

25:32.340 --> 25:34.592
You believe me, I know.
And you can

25:34.676 --> 25:36.594
start with that pair of boots.

25:36.678 --> 25:37.971
Give me that here.

25:38.054 --> 25:41.850
Just to hell with 'em.
You do your work, they'll come.

25:59.868 --> 26:06.458
That's a fine piece of work.

26:06.541 --> 26:08.960
Oh, hello, Miss. Can I help you?

26:09.044 --> 26:11.463
I'd like to know,
sir, how much it

26:11.546 --> 26:13.506
would cost to get these shoes
fixed up.

26:13.590 --> 26:16.468
I'll take a look at
'em.

26:16.551 --> 26:18.970
Oh, Miss, I'm afraid these...

26:19.054 --> 26:23.933
these shoes are beyond repair.
Would you like to

26:24.017 --> 26:25.894
buy another pair?

26:26.770 --> 26:28.980
No, I... I can't.

26:29.064 --> 26:31.358
All right.
Well, I thank you for

26:31.441 --> 26:33.318
coming in and I wish you good
day.

26:33.401 --> 26:35.278
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:52.587 --> 26:54.339
Damn, would ya
look at these?

26:54.422 --> 26:55.840
I'd swear these here are new
shoes.

26:55.924 --> 27:00.011
Did you do this
work, boy?

27:00.095 --> 27:02.514
Ain't no damn
way.

27:02.597 --> 27:06.685
Well, iffin' he
did, he's the best.

27:06.768 --> 27:08.019
Except for you, Dave.

27:08.103 --> 27:10.188
Yeah, you're the
best.

27:10.271 --> 27:13.233
I know that, boys.
He's a fine cobbler.

27:13.316 --> 27:15.860
Well, we'll be
gettin' on now.

27:15.944 --> 27:16.903
See you, Dave.

27:16.987 --> 27:18.697
Yeah, see 'ya,
Dave.

27:18.780 --> 27:20.865
We'll tell everybody he's real
good.

27:20.949 --> 27:23.034
Thanks, Dummy.

27:23.118 --> 27:30.792
Hey!
His name is William.

27:43.638 --> 27:47.058
Oh, well, we should
have these

27:47.142 --> 27:50.562
ready in about... oh, about a
week, boys.

27:50.645 --> 27:54.149
Here you go.
There you go.

27:59.154 --> 28:01.573
Oh, Ruth, there.
Mabel.

28:01.656 --> 28:05.910
Let me see what you got here.
Oh, dear.

28:05.994 --> 28:08.246
Why did you wait so long before
you brought

28:08.330 --> 28:09.789
your shoes in to be fixed?

28:09.873 --> 28:10.749
Well... well, we
we didn't. It's just that...

28:11.833 --> 28:12.959
We didn't have the
time.

28:13.043 --> 28:14.127
That's it.
That's what it was.

28:14.210 --> 28:15.545
Oh, well, that's
all right.

28:15.628 --> 28:18.798
We're gonna fix these shoes so
they look brand-new, huh?

28:18.882 --> 28:21.760
TWill they be as
good as the Waller boys' shoes?

28:21.843 --> 28:24.262
Even better.

28:24.346 --> 28:25.347
Thank you, Mr.
Beagle.

28:25.430 --> 28:26.264
Yes, thank you.

28:26.348 --> 28:28.058
Take care.

28:33.521 --> 28:35.690
How would you like
to buy the shop?

28:44.407 --> 28:45.325
Yeah.
Yeah.

28:45.408 --> 28:47.952
Well, you know, I'm gettin' up
in

28:48.036 --> 28:51.122
years, and, well, my hands, you
know,

28:51.206 --> 28:55.627
they're just... they're no good
anymore,

28:55.710 --> 28:59.798
and this town needs a good
cobbler,

28:59.881 --> 29:06.596
and I can't think of anybody
better than you. Huh? What?

29:11.226 --> 29:13.645
Oh, yeah, you gotta talk to your
dad.

29:13.728 --> 29:17.232
You talk to your dad and you
let me know what he says.

29:17.315 --> 29:18.316
All right?

29:18.400 --> 29:22.070
Now let's get back and do this
work.

29:42.924 --> 29:43.925
Oh, look, there's that
dummy.

29:44.926 --> 29:49.597
- Ow, Ma!
- Ow!

29:57.272 --> 30:01.109
Daddy, come on.
This way.

30:03.778 --> 30:06.865
Preacher, great
sermon.

30:06.948 --> 30:07.907
Thank you.

30:22.672 --> 30:27.135
Who's that?

30:28.011 --> 30:30.513
Well, I know it's a
girl.

30:32.474 --> 30:33.475
She came in the shop

30:33.558 --> 30:36.061
the other day
needing some shoes.

30:36.519 --> 30:42.233
Well, she's pretty.
Do you like her a little bit?

30:42.317 --> 30:46.571
Huh? Easy, boys.
Come on, now.

30:46.655 --> 30:50.241
She is pretty, though.

30:50.325 --> 30:53.328
Hey, how's...
how's Mr. Beagle treating you?

30:59.709 --> 31:02.754
Real fine, Pop.
It's pretty busy now.

31:02.837 --> 31:06.925
Mister... Mr. Beagle
wants to sell you the shop?

31:07.008 --> 31:09.594
That's great news, son.
That is great.

31:09.678 --> 31:15.934
That's wonderful. Wow.
I'm proud of you.

31:16.017 --> 31:18.603
Wait.
You've earned it.

31:18.687 --> 31:20.647
It's good.
You've earned it.

31:20.730 --> 31:22.440
You keep it up.
Okay?

31:22.524 --> 31:27.070
I'm proud of you. Uh-huh.

32:08.403 --> 32:11.323
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:11.406 --> 32:14.200
Sir, I can't pay for these.
I got no money.

32:14.284 --> 32:16.995
Didn't you hear what I said?

32:17.078 --> 32:19.581
I got no money.

32:21.583 --> 32:28.256
For me?
Thanks, sir. Oh!

32:36.431 --> 32:37.682
Look, guys,
look!

32:37.766 --> 32:39.184
Look what the new cobbler gave
me!

32:39.267 --> 32:41.144
Woah!

32:43.605 --> 32:47.859
You're a good man,
William.

32:47.942 --> 32:49.778
A very fine man.

32:52.781 --> 32:55.533
Hi.
I know you can't

32:55.617 --> 32:58.036
hear me, but I wanted to say

32:58.119 --> 33:02.374
thank you for giving my brother
shoes.

33:02.457 --> 33:05.877
I'd like to pay you for them.

33:05.960 --> 33:09.547
I know it's not much,
but it's all I have.

33:09.631 --> 33:17.013
My pa, he doesn't work much.
I'm sorry. Oh.

33:23.311 --> 33:30.694
You're very kind. Thank you.

33:46.501 --> 33:53.883
Hi, William Hoy.
I'm Sarah Evans.

34:24.205 --> 34:28.375
Yes, I'm fine,
thank you.

34:32.880 --> 34:37.009
Are you waiting for
someone?

34:37.092 --> 34:40.471
Yes, I am waiting for someone.

34:40.554 --> 34:47.895
No, I'm waiting for you. You.
Do you want to walk?

35:06.748 --> 35:09.501
I want you to teach
me

35:09.584 --> 35:11.836
how to talk with my hands.

35:11.920 --> 35:18.134
You want to learn sign?

35:26.601 --> 35:28.687
You want
to learn how to sign?

35:28.770 --> 35:33.775
Yes. Yes, I want to learn.

35:52.794 --> 35:56.214
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

35:56.297 --> 35:58.758
I need my shoes fixed.

35:58.842 --> 36:03.555
Hey, buddy, you gonna answer me?
Hey!

36:03.638 --> 36:06.391
Hey!

36:06.474 --> 36:09.769
Okay, then.

36:09.853 --> 36:16.109
I'll go someplace else.

36:16.192 --> 36:18.486
Finally I get your
attention.

36:20.530 --> 36:24.284
You can't hear?

36:24.367 --> 36:27.412
Well, why don't you rig you up
somethin' to this door,

36:27.495 --> 36:31.750
a pulley system, so when you
open the door...

36:31.833 --> 36:35.587
... it
falls.

36:35.670 --> 36:41.301
Look, here's the door.

36:41.384 --> 36:45.930
You get a pulley, take
a line, and

36:46.014 --> 36:50.101
you rig it, you tie it to this
hammer.

36:50.185 --> 36:57.484
When the door opens, the hammer
falls

36:57.567 --> 37:00.945
and you feel it.

37:01.029 --> 37:05.617
You're welcome.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.453
I need new soles.

37:08.536 --> 37:10.955
I'll fix them for free.

37:11.039 --> 37:13.124
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You work

37:13.208 --> 37:14.626
really hard.
I'll pay you.

37:14.709 --> 37:15.710
I'll pay you.

37:15.794 --> 37:19.130
I want to
pay you

37:19.214 --> 37:21.007
back for your idea.

37:21.091 --> 37:25.303
Just do a really good
job on them.

37:25.387 --> 37:28.056
That'll be payment enough.

37:30.892 --> 37:32.143
That's good.

37:32.227 --> 37:33.895
Good.
Thank you very much.

37:52.414 --> 37:57.335
Throw it! Throw it!

37:57.419 --> 38:00.672
He's out. He's out!
You see that throw?

38:00.755 --> 38:03.508
That's no fair.
He can't do that.

38:03.591 --> 38:05.260
He ain't even playin'.

38:25.280 --> 38:29.784
Why you got that
hammer hittin' the floor?

38:30.618 --> 38:31.703
Come
here.

38:31.786 --> 38:32.829
Put your hands on the floor.

38:39.627 --> 38:41.296
The floor
vibrates.

38:51.139 --> 38:53.058
What does it say?

38:53.141 --> 39:00.148
Si-si-since I cannot
h-h-hear, I f-f-

39:02.317 --> 39:08.239
feel the... the vibr-bration.

39:08.323 --> 39:10.950
He feels the vibration.
That's what it says.

39:11.034 --> 39:12.035
Why can't you hear?

39:12.118 --> 39:13.411
He can't
hear you, stupid.

39:13.828 --> 39:15.455
Don't call me stupid.

39:15.538 --> 39:16.748
He just told you he
can't hear,

39:16.831 --> 39:17.999
so why did you ask the question?

39:18.083 --> 39:19.584
- Then write it.
- You write it.

39:19.668 --> 39:21.252
Why?
'Cause you can't write, stupid?

39:21.336 --> 39:22.420
- Can you?
- Yeah.

39:22.504 --> 39:24.255
Okay.
Then go ahead, write it.

39:24.339 --> 39:25.590
Why don't you-all write
it?

39:25.674 --> 39:27.092
Well, you asked the
question.

39:27.175 --> 39:29.469
Yeah, you asked the
question.

39:29.552 --> 39:31.596
Calm
down.

39:31.680 --> 39:35.100
Would you like to
play baseball with us?

39:35.183 --> 39:38.269
Baseball.

39:38.353 --> 39:41.272
Would you like to play with us?

39:41.356 --> 39:45.360
If you
learn to

39:49.698 --> 39:57.205
read and write, we can play
baseball.

40:15.765 --> 40:17.726
Let me
have it.

40:35.410 --> 40:37.996
Let's
play.

41:28.797 --> 41:33.218
Gene was the
kindest little

41:33.301 --> 41:37.847
soul in the world, but this hint
about...

41:44.980 --> 41:52.737
I want to see you.

42:11.006 --> 42:15.802
You... you want to
start a team

42:15.885 --> 42:17.429
with us?
Wow!

42:17.512 --> 42:19.180
Ya mean it?

42:33.695 --> 42:40.368
How do you always know
where the ball is going?

42:48.043 --> 42:53.465
Wow!

42:59.054 --> 43:02.307
Excuse me, boys.
What's the name of your team?

43:02.390 --> 43:05.185
Stonewall Jackson Ball
Club.

43:05.268 --> 43:08.146
That's a great name.
Play here every day?

43:08.229 --> 43:10.649
That's right, Mister.
That's our playing field.

43:10.732 --> 43:12.192
Yeah, we got us a big
game

43:12.275 --> 43:13.485
tomorrow over at the park.

43:13.568 --> 43:15.487
Yeah, it's gonna be big.
The whole

43:15.570 --> 43:17.489
darn town's gonna come out and
watch us.

43:17.572 --> 43:19.157
That's great.

43:19.240 --> 43:23.495
Tell me somethin', that guy with
the shirt and the tie, who's he?

43:23.578 --> 43:27.666
He's the cobbler.
He play pretty good, don't he?

43:27.749 --> 43:30.001
Yes, he does.

43:30.085 --> 43:33.546
Okay.
Yeah, we won't tell Pa

43:33.630 --> 43:35.507
we're playing ball.

43:35.590 --> 43:38.510
Thank you, boys.
Good luck tomorrow.

43:38.593 --> 43:44.516
- Thanks, Mister.
- You bet.

43:44.599 --> 43:49.229
Young man,
can I have a moment?

43:49.312 --> 43:55.360
Excuse me. Young man. Excuse me.

43:58.947 --> 44:02.200
Excuse me. Young man.

44:02.283 --> 44:03.118
Hey, Mister,

44:03.201 --> 44:07.038
you know he can't hear 'ya,
don't 'ya?

44:07.122 --> 44:08.081
Who?

44:08.164 --> 44:10.208
The cobbler, Dummy
Hoy.

44:10.291 --> 44:12.252
Why do you call him
that?

44:12.335 --> 44:16.047
Because he's deaf
and dumb.

44:16.131 --> 44:17.382
You're talkin' about the
young man

44:17.465 --> 44:19.009
that just walked into that shoe
store?

44:19.092 --> 44:21.344
Yes, sir.

44:21.428 --> 44:22.887
That's exactly who
I'm talking about.

44:23.513 --> 44:24.764
Can't hear anything?

44:24.848 --> 44:27.267
Poor boy can't
hear or speak a lick.

44:27.350 --> 44:28.810
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:30.312 --> 44:36.818
Ball. Ball.
B-A-L-L.

44:50.165 --> 44:53.084
What's with you
and that deaf and dumb boy?

44:53.168 --> 44:55.962
Nothing, Daddy.
He's just a nice boy.

44:56.046 --> 44:57.756
Yeah.
Well, you two

44:57.839 --> 44:59.299
seem to be gettin' real close.

44:59.382 --> 45:02.093
Daddy, I like him.

45:02.177 --> 45:06.306
He's not normal.
I don't want you gettin' to like

45:06.389 --> 45:07.265
him too much.

45:07.349 --> 45:09.934
Now, what's all this hand stuff?

45:10.018 --> 45:11.770
That's the way he
talks.

45:11.853 --> 45:13.605
It makes the two
of you

45:13.688 --> 45:15.482
look like monkeys.
Stay away from him.

45:15.565 --> 45:16.566
Daddy!

45:16.650 --> 45:18.109
Did you
hear what I said?!

45:18.193 --> 45:20.111
He gave Jimmy a
pair of

45:20.195 --> 45:21.946
shoes whenever he needed them.

45:22.030 --> 45:23.782
If I hada known
he needed

45:23.865 --> 45:25.784
them, I would have got Jimmy
some shoes.

45:25.867 --> 45:27.619
Well, if you'd quit
drinking,

45:27.702 --> 45:28.995
you would have known.

45:29.079 --> 45:33.458
Woman,
talk some sense into this girl.

45:33.541 --> 45:35.877
Never mind.
I know what you're gonna say,

45:35.960 --> 45:36.795
Mama.

45:41.383 --> 45:43.968
Gittup here.
Gittup here.

45:44.052 --> 45:45.470
Whoa, boy.
Good boy.

45:45.553 --> 45:47.055
Let's go on.

45:47.138 --> 45:49.766
- Is that William and the boys?
- I believe it is.

45:50.767 --> 45:52.018
Frank!

45:52.102 --> 45:53.979
- Hey, Pa.
- Frank, come here.

45:54.062 --> 45:57.315
- What are you boys doin'?
- Nothing, Pa.

45:57.399 --> 45:58.650
Don't you "Nothing,
Pa" me.

45:58.733 --> 45:59.651
I saw you playing ball.

45:59.734 --> 46:01.820
William, I told you I didn't
want

46:01.903 --> 46:04.155
you playin' baseball, correct?

46:04.239 --> 46:05.824
Pa, William's real
good

46:05.907 --> 46:07.200
at playing baseball.

46:07.283 --> 46:08.493
Yeah, I don't want
to hear nothin' of it.

46:08.576 --> 46:11.329
You got a business to run right
now.

46:11.413 --> 46:12.998
Boys, get in the wagon.

46:13.081 --> 46:20.755
William, I want you back at the
shoe store.

46:39.774 --> 46:43.570
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to...

46:43.653 --> 46:46.364
You played pretty good.

46:46.448 --> 46:52.704
You should be out there with
the rest of the boys having fun.

46:52.787 --> 46:54.289
You can't hear me, can you?

46:56.458 --> 46:58.209
I watched you play ball.

46:58.293 --> 47:00.962
You're a natural.

47:03.298 --> 47:06.801
Now, do you think you can play
that well against pro players?

47:08.803 --> 47:13.224
My name is Dooley.
I'm a baseball scout.

47:13.308 --> 47:19.064
I would like you to go to Urbana
with me

47:19.147 --> 47:23.902
and play for Kenton.
Can you go?

47:23.985 --> 47:25.987
Why?

47:38.041 --> 47:42.587
It doesn't look like there's a
lot of business.

47:42.671 --> 47:46.424
I'll tell you what, if you want
to go,

47:46.508 --> 47:50.261
be at the train station next
Saturday.

47:50.345 --> 47:53.181
I'll buy your ticket.

48:06.194 --> 48:08.947
Play that
one more

48:09.030 --> 48:10.615
time.
You sold that.

48:10.699 --> 48:12.784
Okay. Where is it now? Uh-huh.

48:12.867 --> 48:17.622
One more time.
One more time.

48:17.706 --> 48:20.625
Oh, hold on.
Let's see.

48:20.709 --> 48:23.128
This man saw me play
today and

48:23.211 --> 48:25.296
wants me to play on the Kenton
team.

48:25.380 --> 48:28.383
A man wants you to play baseball
for Kenton?

48:28.883 --> 48:30.885
Who is this man?

48:40.061 --> 48:42.522
His name is Dooley,
a baseball scout.

48:42.605 --> 48:46.651
Ora, give papa a kiss.
Go sit down, please.

48:46.735 --> 48:48.320
Thank you, Honey.

48:48.403 --> 48:52.490
William, we already talked about
baseball.

48:52.574 --> 48:54.576
You have a business now. Okay?

49:04.294 --> 49:05.670
It'll be for just one
day.

49:05.754 --> 49:08.506
Besides, no one is coming
into the shop right now.

49:08.590 --> 49:15.597
That's a bunch of hogwash.
Baseball is not a game for you.

49:20.935 --> 49:24.939
I'm good at it, Pa.
I said no.

49:31.279 --> 49:33.531
You said I could play.
I said maybe.

49:33.615 --> 49:39.204
He's real good, Pa.

49:39.287 --> 49:42.040
Anybody else?

49:42.123 --> 49:43.875
Listen to me, family,

49:43.958 --> 49:46.378
I don't think this is a good idea.

49:46.461 --> 49:50.465
He has a business now.
I'm sorry, son.

49:56.304 --> 49:59.641
Becca, that was a great dinner,
honey.

50:11.820 --> 50:16.282
Dummy, we heard about
the scout.

50:16.366 --> 50:20.203
Kenton and Urbana are big
rivals.

50:27.502 --> 50:34.759
What?

50:34.843 --> 50:40.682
This is your big chance.

51:00.076 --> 51:07.459
I think you
should follow your dream.

51:07.542 --> 51:12.464
My father would be very angry.

51:12.547 --> 51:17.635
Wouldn't he
want you to be happy?

51:17.719 --> 51:21.723
He wants
me to have a future. He's right.

51:27.062 --> 51:32.817
I know you want to
honor

51:32.901 --> 51:38.156
your father, but think about it.

51:38.239 --> 51:43.912
You are very good.

52:51.646 --> 52:53.481
Read it!

53:46.242 --> 53:49.245
All aboard!

53:56.252 --> 54:01.216
All aboard!

54:06.054 --> 54:10.517
Do you always wear a shirt and
tie?

54:10.600 --> 54:15.271
Get on the train.

54:45.969 --> 54:49.014
See that pitcher over
there?

54:49.097 --> 54:50.682
That's Billy Hart.

54:50.765 --> 54:54.311
Think you can hit off of him?

55:01.776 --> 55:07.532
Oh, yeah.
Don't let on that you're deaf.

55:07.615 --> 55:09.117
Trust me.

55:13.288 --> 55:16.333
Woah!

55:21.129 --> 55:22.422
Hey, Scout.

55:22.505 --> 55:25.717
Hello, boys.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.093
How ya doin', Scout?

55:27.177 --> 55:28.553
Good. Yourself, Billy?

55:28.636 --> 55:30.722
Feeling good.
Ready to beat your boys.

55:30.805 --> 55:31.931
Who 'ya got here?

55:32.015 --> 55:34.225
Oh, it's a new guy I'm
looking at.

55:34.309 --> 55:35.727
Wanna see him play.

55:35.810 --> 55:37.729
Your guys could use
all the help they can get.

55:37.812 --> 55:40.273
But he looks a little small
to be playing ball, ain't he?

55:40.357 --> 55:42.233
That's what I like about
you,

55:42.317 --> 55:43.568
Billy, you're so modest.

55:43.652 --> 55:45.570
We'll see 'ya out
there, kid.

55:45.654 --> 55:48.323
Come on, kid.
Let's see what you got.

55:55.830 --> 55:57.415
Dummy's gone to
Urbana.

55:57.499 --> 55:58.833
You won't get your shoes.

55:58.917 --> 56:02.420
Oh, Mr. Hoy. I didn't...
I didn't know it was you, sir.

56:02.504 --> 56:05.423
It's okay.

56:05.507 --> 56:09.678
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

56:16.851 --> 56:18.103
Hey, we got a lefty
here.

56:47.048 --> 56:49.718
Son of a gun.

57:22.917 --> 57:24.210
Great game.

57:24.294 --> 57:27.505
Oh, yeah, it is.

57:27.589 --> 57:28.840
Hello.

57:28.923 --> 57:31.051
Hi. Are you deaf?

57:31.134 --> 57:33.845
You got
me.

57:33.928 --> 57:37.182
You play baseball
very well.

57:37.265 --> 57:39.893
Thank
you.

57:39.976 --> 57:41.728
Are you from Urbana?

57:41.811 --> 57:44.022
No, Cincinnati.

57:44.105 --> 57:48.568
You came
all this way to watch me play?

57:48.652 --> 57:51.363
I don't even know
you, sir.

57:51.446 --> 57:55.867
Allow me
to change

57:55.950 --> 57:58.370
that.
I am William Hoy.

57:58.453 --> 57:59.871
And you are?

57:59.954 --> 58:05.210
Anna Marie Lowery.

58:05.293 --> 58:12.801
This is my brother, Frank,
the reason I came here.

58:14.678 --> 58:20.600
He also wants to play this game
baseball.

58:20.684 --> 58:24.896
I'm sure
someday he will.

58:24.980 --> 58:26.439
And who is this?

58:26.523 --> 58:29.901
This is Mrs.
McCall.

58:29.985 --> 58:37.242
She escorted me here from the
Cincinnati Oral School.

58:37.325 --> 58:40.912
Are you a resident?

58:40.996 --> 58:46.584
I teach children
how to use their voice.

58:46.668 --> 58:51.923
I assume you use your voice to
play baseball?

58:52.007 --> 58:55.927
No,
ma'am; I do not.

58:56.011 --> 58:58.638
I have never learned how to.

58:58.722 --> 59:04.728
Well, Mr. Hoy,
I think you should consider it.

59:06.855 --> 59:10.108
I will.
It was a pleasure to meet you,

59:10.191 --> 59:11.109
Miss Lowery.

59:11.192 --> 59:15.113
Maybe someday we will meet
again.

59:15.196 --> 59:18.908
Perhaps we will,
Mr.

59:19.200 --> 59:22.162
Hoy.
Good day.

59:22.245 --> 59:28.126
Good day.
And a pleasure to meet you, Mrs.

59:28.209 --> 59:29.461
McCall, Frank.

59:29.544 --> 59:34.132
A pleasure, sir.

59:34.215 --> 59:38.178
What the hell.

59:38.261 --> 59:39.971
What the hell!
Hey, Scout, who is that guy?

59:40.055 --> 59:42.307
Oh, that's my friend,
Dummy Hoy.

59:42.390 --> 59:43.641
Dummy Hoy?

59:43.725 --> 59:46.311
Yeah, deaf and dumb
kid outta Houcktown.

59:46.394 --> 59:47.562
What are you talkin'
about?

59:47.646 --> 59:48.855
You tellin' me this guy can't
hear nothing?

59:48.938 --> 59:51.316
That's right.
Not a lick.

59:51.399 --> 59:54.486
No way.
Ain't no way no

59:54.569 --> 59:56.488
dummy's gonna beat me.

59:56.571 --> 01:00:00.492
He just did,
Billy boy.

01:00:00.575 --> 01:00:02.952
He just did.

01:00:05.246 --> 01:00:09.209
I'm takin' you to Milwaukee.

01:00:39.489 --> 01:00:41.866
Come on.
Come on.

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:43.034
Gittup
there.

01:00:43.118 --> 01:00:45.370
Gittup there.
Gittup there.

01:00:45.453 --> 01:00:46.371
Come on.

01:00:46.454 --> 01:00:47.372
Gittup there.
Gittup there.

01:00:47.455 --> 01:00:48.289
Gittup there.
Gittup

01:00:48.373 --> 01:00:49.207
there.
Gittup there.

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:53.420
Whoa, boy. Whoa, whoa.

01:00:53.503 --> 01:00:57.132
Whoa! Whoa!

01:01:10.145 --> 01:01:11.896
Gittup there.
Gittup there.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.231
Come on.
Come on.

01:01:13.315 --> 01:01:15.400
Gittup there.
Get out of there!

01:01:15.483 --> 01:01:16.318
Come on!

01:01:26.328 --> 01:01:27.704
What is this?

01:01:27.787 --> 01:01:28.621
What?

01:01:28.705 --> 01:01:31.916
Ask him what this is.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.793
What is that?

01:01:33.877 --> 01:01:37.297
It's why
I want to play baseball.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.884
It's why
I want to play baseball.

01:01:51.019 --> 01:01:52.437
What does it say?

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.026
It says,
"Stay away from Sarah, freak."

01:02:02.864 --> 01:02:05.450
He wants me to tell
you that

01:02:05.533 --> 01:02:08.119
he never meant to go against
your wishes.

01:02:08.203 --> 01:02:12.624
I just wanted to prove to
everyone

01:02:12.707 --> 01:02:18.296
that I could do what other boys
could do.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.967
I know people look at me like
I'm some

01:02:23.051 --> 01:02:28.640
monkey behind the counter fixing
their shoes,

01:02:28.723 --> 01:02:36.314
but just because I can't hear
doesn't mean I don't feel.

01:02:36.398 --> 01:02:39.818
Pa, look at me!

01:02:39.901 --> 01:02:44.030
I'm small and I'm deaf, and
nobody

01:02:44.114 --> 01:02:48.493
takes me serious until I show
them

01:02:48.576 --> 01:02:53.498
what I can do.
I know why...

01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:57.877
I know why you and Ma don't
want me to play baseball.

01:02:57.961 --> 01:03:01.965
You think that I'm going to
get hurt because I'm deaf.

01:03:08.263 --> 01:03:14.269
I need you... to prove to you
that I'm good at baseball.

01:03:16.604 --> 01:03:23.987
Dooley wants to send me to
Milwaukee.

01:03:27.115 --> 01:03:31.369
I know you and Ma want to
protect

01:03:31.453 --> 01:03:36.541
me, but I don't want to hide
behind you

01:03:36.624 --> 01:03:44.215
while other people laugh at us
and call us names.

01:03:44.299 --> 01:03:50.055
I want you to be proud of me and
tell everyone,

01:03:50.138 --> 01:03:55.435
"There goes my son.
Have you seen him play ball?"

01:04:02.859 --> 01:04:09.658
Oh, that's my boy.

01:04:31.846 --> 01:04:36.518
You go show 'em, boy.

01:04:41.356 --> 01:04:46.111
You write.
You write to us quick.

01:04:46.194 --> 01:04:50.031
I will.

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:02.794
Driver: Mr.
Hoy?

01:05:02.877 --> 01:05:04.129
Mr.
William Hoy?

01:05:04.212 --> 01:05:06.673
Tell him it's time to
go.

01:05:06.756 --> 01:05:10.301
It's time for you to go.

01:05:10.385 --> 01:05:18.310
Promise me you'll be back
to open the shop for the fall.

01:05:18.393 --> 01:05:19.811
I
promise.

01:05:19.894 --> 01:05:21.354
Thank
you.

01:05:56.264 --> 01:06:03.605
Sir, your ticket.
Sir? Sir? Sir, your ticket.

01:06:40.141 --> 01:06:42.394
Let's go,
Trevor.

01:06:42.477 --> 01:06:43.395
All right.
Get to the ball, Alan!

01:06:43.478 --> 01:06:44.604
Get to the ball!
Play at first!

01:06:44.688 --> 01:06:48.108
Play at first! Come on!
What's going on, guys?

01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:50.110
Get the ball in.

01:06:50.193 --> 01:06:52.737
Come on.
Don't walk to the ball.

01:06:52.821 --> 01:06:55.115
Alan, make the play.
Go to first.

01:06:55.198 --> 01:06:57.075
What do ya want?

01:06:57.158 --> 01:07:00.078
Yeah, I'm the manager.

01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:05.667
There you go. That's it.
That's it. Do it again.

01:07:10.005 --> 01:07:13.425
So, Dooley sent you for a
tryout, huh?

01:07:13.508 --> 01:07:16.261
What's with the notes, kid?

01:07:16.344 --> 01:07:20.140
What, don't you hear?

01:07:20.223 --> 01:07:25.270
I get it.
This is some joke, right?

01:07:25.353 --> 01:07:29.441
Dooley's playin' me for some
damn fool.

01:07:29.524 --> 01:07:33.945
You don't understand?

01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:40.452
I said this is a joke.
A joke.

01:07:40.535 --> 01:07:45.290
Either you really can't hear or
Dooley's fartin' around with me.

01:07:45.373 --> 01:07:46.833
Tell me this is a joke.

01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:49.419
Write it.

01:07:55.717 --> 01:07:57.469
Ah, for
Pete's sake,

01:07:57.552 --> 01:07:59.346
how you gonna play ball if you
can't hear?

01:07:59.429 --> 01:08:02.015
What's that knucklehead
thinkin'?

01:08:02.098 --> 01:08:05.977
Listen, kid, I mean, whatever.

01:08:06.061 --> 01:08:09.314
You go back and tell Dooley
"thanks, but no thanks".

01:08:09.397 --> 01:08:11.983
I need an outfielder that
can hear.

01:08:12.067 --> 01:08:14.361
You want me to write that down?

01:08:14.444 --> 01:08:20.492
Okay.
Dooley, thanks but no thanks.

01:08:20.575 --> 01:08:23.828
Send me an outfielder that can
hear.

01:08:23.912 --> 01:08:26.206
Now get outta here!

01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:27.499
All right.
Let's play ball, guys.

01:08:27.582 --> 01:08:28.416
Come on!
What?!

01:08:28.499 --> 01:08:29.334
Just try
me out,

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:30.542
that's all I am asking.

01:08:30.627 --> 01:08:32.002
I told you I
can't, kid.

01:08:32.087 --> 01:08:35.798
You don't hear, and in this game
you gotta hear.

01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:39.260
That's it. Let's go!

01:08:39.343 --> 01:08:45.725
- Read.
- I can't. No.

01:08:45.809 --> 01:08:52.106
These boys need to depend
on each other and you need to

01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:53.108
hear.

01:08:53.191 --> 01:08:56.861
Ah, forget it. No.
Now, go away.

01:08:56.944 --> 01:08:59.363
Dooley, what's he thinkin'
sending me a freak.

01:08:59.446 --> 01:09:02.617
Make the play!
Make the play, Seth! Come on!

01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:11.542
Hey, you gotta
call for the ball!

01:09:11.626 --> 01:09:14.212
Nice play,
kid!

01:09:14.294 --> 01:09:15.879
Hey, tell this
kid

01:09:15.962 --> 01:09:17.381
he's gotta call for the ball.

01:09:17.465 --> 01:09:19.718
I can't.
He's deaf.

01:09:19.801 --> 01:09:22.553
- He's what?
- Deaf!

01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:24.555
What's he doin'
here, then?

01:09:24.638 --> 01:09:27.434
Just let him
play.

01:09:27.517 --> 01:09:29.227
I can't believe this.

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:32.229
Ahhh!

01:09:32.314 --> 01:09:34.566
Play ball!

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:46.077
All right.
We got us a right fielder.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.082
Damn, kid, Dooley's right.
I want you.

01:09:51.166 --> 01:09:56.338
You did a good job out there.
All right. Whatcha got?

01:09:57.672 --> 01:10:04.721
$65 a month? No, no, no.
You're just gettin' started.

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:13.021
$55 a month.

01:10:15.857 --> 01:10:17.275
No, no, no, no.
Listen, I got guys

01:10:17.359 --> 01:10:18.777
out there that have been playing

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.446
with me two years that
don't make $65 a month.

01:10:21.529 --> 01:10:22.697
But I'm
good.

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:23.698
I can catch the ball and I can
hit the ball.

01:10:23.782 --> 01:10:24.824
You did
great.

01:10:24.908 --> 01:10:26.785
You did great, but they can play
too.

01:10:26.868 --> 01:10:30.789
You work hard, maybe you can
make 65,

01:10:30.872 --> 01:10:34.042
but you're gonna start at 55.

01:10:41.216 --> 01:10:43.802
Read
that.

01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:46.680
I
may be

01:10:46.763 --> 01:10:49.516
deaf and dumb, but I'm not
stupid.

01:10:49.599 --> 01:10:52.352
Hey, you listen to me, kid!

01:10:52.435 --> 01:10:55.981
You will never play baseball!
Do you hear me?!

01:10:56.064 --> 01:10:58.984
You will never play for this or
any other team!

01:10:59.067 --> 01:11:00.402
I'll see to it!

01:11:00.485 --> 01:11:04.155
Do you hear me? Arrr!
Of course he doesn't hear me!

01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:05.740
Damn it!

01:11:08.576 --> 01:11:15.750
William! Oh, God!
Something's wrong!

01:11:18.461 --> 01:11:19.671
Are you all right?

01:11:19.754 --> 01:11:20.672
I'm all
right.

01:11:20.755 --> 01:11:21.881
What?
What did he say?

01:11:21.965 --> 01:11:22.841
He's fine.

01:11:22.924 --> 01:11:24.342
Well, what happened?

01:11:24.426 --> 01:11:25.719
What happened?

01:11:25.802 --> 01:11:28.179
They want
me to play for them.

01:11:28.263 --> 01:11:30.181
They want
him to play for them.

01:11:30.265 --> 01:11:32.017
Well, that's great!

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.852
But I
said no.

01:11:33.935 --> 01:11:35.562
But he said no.

01:11:35.645 --> 01:11:37.230
He said no?
Well, no?

01:11:37.314 --> 01:11:39.065
Well, why did he say... well,
why?

01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:43.862
Why? This is
what you've always wanted.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.368
Didn't pay me
enough, so I said no.

01:12:12.807 --> 01:12:17.520
What happened in
Milwaukee?

01:12:22.817 --> 01:12:27.739
You're right. You are better.

01:12:27.822 --> 01:12:33.244
You're going to Oshkosh.

01:12:33.328 --> 01:12:39.084
This time, I'm going with you.

01:12:39.167 --> 01:12:42.587
Get your stuff.

01:12:50.053 --> 01:12:54.849
Ticket, sir.

01:13:00.855 --> 01:13:03.733
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

01:13:23.878 --> 01:13:26.339
Frank Selee,
you old goat, how are 'ya?

01:13:26.423 --> 01:13:28.133
Dooley,
you old skunk, how are you?

01:13:28.216 --> 01:13:30.635
- Doin' good. Doin' good.
- Who's the kid?

01:13:30.719 --> 01:13:32.345
He's a new player
I picked up in Houcktown.

01:13:32.429 --> 01:13:34.514
I'm tellin' you straight, he's a
natural.

01:13:34.597 --> 01:13:37.058
Yeah?
Kind of small, ain't he?

01:13:37.142 --> 01:13:38.351
Hey!
Come on!

01:13:38.435 --> 01:13:40.645
Come on! Let's see a little
hustle out there!

01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:42.981
Slow as molasses in February.

01:13:43.064 --> 01:13:46.484
Listen, Frank, this is
probably one of the best players

01:13:46.568 --> 01:13:48.987
I've seen come along in a while.

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:50.655
Yeah?
What's your name, kid?

01:13:50.739 --> 01:13:53.658
Yeah, there... did I
fail to

01:13:53.742 --> 01:13:56.661
mention that he is deaf and
dumb?

01:13:56.745 --> 01:13:57.996
You're kidding me.

01:13:58.079 --> 01:14:01.374
Yeah. Well, no, I'm not.

01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:03.668
Sorry, kid, I can't
use you.

01:14:03.752 --> 01:14:05.045
All right?
All right?

01:14:05.128 --> 01:14:08.673
Dooley, get me someone
that can hear and we'll talk.

01:14:08.757 --> 01:14:11.551
Come on, Frank.
You and I go back a long way.

01:14:11.634 --> 01:14:15.180
Yeah. Yeah. No, no.
Sorry, I can't use him.

01:14:15.263 --> 01:14:16.097
Why?

01:14:16.181 --> 01:14:17.349
'Cause he's
deaf and dumb.

01:14:17.432 --> 01:14:20.518
You know there's a
deaf and dumb team, don't you?

01:14:20.602 --> 01:14:22.562
Frank, what do you have
to lose?

01:14:22.646 --> 01:14:24.356
Just watch him play for a while,

01:14:24.439 --> 01:14:28.068
and if you don't see that
he's that good, we'll walk away.

01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:29.027
How's he gonna

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:30.362
communicate with
the other players

01:14:30.445 --> 01:14:33.365
out there if he's deaf and dumb?
Besides, he's too small.

01:14:33.448 --> 01:14:35.867
Huh? What's he want here?

01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:39.704
He wants to tell you
something.

01:14:39.788 --> 01:14:42.540
You think that
you're...

01:14:42.624 --> 01:14:46.044
Your boy here thinks he's
better than any of my guys.

01:14:46.127 --> 01:14:49.506
You got a lot of gumption, kid,
I'll give you that.

01:14:54.135 --> 01:14:57.389
You're right, what have I got to
lose?

01:14:57.472 --> 01:15:00.183
Yeah, yeah. No, go on.
Go on. Get out there.

01:15:03.019 --> 01:15:04.270
Thanks, Frank.

01:15:04.354 --> 01:15:05.397
Yeah. This is
gonna be interesting.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.731
Yes, it is.

01:15:06.815 --> 01:15:08.566
Ah, come on,
guys!

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.069
We're gonna have to do better
than this.

01:15:11.152 --> 01:15:13.446
Try hard! Play hard! Train hard!

01:15:13.530 --> 01:15:16.241
If we wanna be the best,
we gotta train and

01:15:16.324 --> 01:15:17.575
play like the best.

01:15:17.659 --> 01:15:20.412
All right. Come on!
Let's play some ball!

01:15:20.495 --> 01:15:26.084
Hey! Hey, kid! Kid,
move back! Hey, kid, move...

01:15:26.167 --> 01:15:28.628
Why am I yelling?

01:15:28.712 --> 01:15:30.755
Dooley, are you pullin' my leg?

01:15:30.839 --> 01:15:33.425
Just let him play,
Frank.

01:15:33.508 --> 01:15:34.926
Krock!
Krock,

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:37.429
tell the new kid, tell him to
move back!

01:15:37.512 --> 01:15:39.931
Hey you, move back!

01:15:40.015 --> 01:15:41.099
What's wrong with this kid?

01:15:41.182 --> 01:15:42.142
He can't hear.

01:15:42.225 --> 01:15:43.143
What?

01:15:43.226 --> 01:15:44.311
He can't hear
either.

01:15:44.394 --> 01:15:47.814
C'mon, coach.
This is a joke!

01:15:47.897 --> 01:15:49.441
Give him a break,
Kinz.

01:15:49.524 --> 01:15:52.777
You're replacin'
Joneszy with this guy?

01:15:52.861 --> 01:15:57.615
I ain't replacing
anyone with him yet.

01:15:57.699 --> 01:16:03.788
Throw that ball in here.
I'll teach him not to play

01:16:03.872 --> 01:16:04.789
shallow.

01:16:10.045 --> 01:16:13.965
Way to go, kid!

01:16:14.049 --> 01:16:16.718
- He's fast.

01:16:35.904 --> 01:16:37.989
Boy's got an arm.

01:16:38.073 --> 01:16:41.576
The show's just
gettin' started, Frank.

01:17:00.762 --> 01:17:04.099
Hey, he can hit.

01:17:17.445 --> 01:17:21.157
- This boy's good.
- Yes, he is.

01:17:22.951 --> 01:17:24.202
Hey, Frank, you want to talk to
him?

01:17:24.285 --> 01:17:26.454
Huh? Huh? Oh, yeah.

01:17:35.005 --> 01:17:39.551
Good? You're great, kid.

01:17:39.634 --> 01:17:41.553
Yeah, he was right.

01:17:41.636 --> 01:17:45.932
I want you.
I want you on my team.

01:17:46.016 --> 01:17:47.976
You.

01:17:57.152 --> 01:18:00.739
$65 a month.

01:18:00.822 --> 01:18:04.075
Yeah.
Well, you got yourself a deal,

01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:06.911
kid.
You got yourself a deal.

01:18:06.995 --> 01:18:09.914
Yeah, so,

01:18:09.998 --> 01:18:12.625
be back here in two weeks.
Two weeks,

01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:14.419
we start practice then.

01:18:14.502 --> 01:18:20.800
Here. What's... what's your
name, kid? What's your name?

01:18:20.884 --> 01:18:23.970
William Hoy. The boys
back home call him Dummy Hoy.

01:18:24.054 --> 01:18:27.932
Dummy Hoy?

01:18:28.016 --> 01:18:29.309
Okay.
Dummy.

01:18:29.392 --> 01:18:30.769
I like it.

01:18:30.852 --> 01:18:35.940
Dummy Hoy. Alright.

01:19:29.577 --> 01:19:33.164
Excuse me.
I said excuse me.

01:19:33.248 --> 01:19:37.252
Can you tell me where
I can find the post office?

01:19:57.772 --> 01:20:01.401
Hello.
I am trying to locate someone.

01:20:01.484 --> 01:20:03.028
Maybe you could help me.

01:20:03.111 --> 01:20:05.572
Who is this
person?

01:20:05.655 --> 01:20:11.369
Anna Marie Lowery.

01:20:11.453 --> 01:20:15.707
Oh, yes.

01:20:26.468 --> 01:20:28.595
I was
hoping you

01:20:28.678 --> 01:20:29.721
would remember me.

01:20:29.804 --> 01:20:32.891
Of course.
How could I

01:20:32.974 --> 01:20:35.894
forget the great baseball
player?

01:20:35.977 --> 01:20:39.731
How is
your brother?

01:20:39.814 --> 01:20:42.233
Did he ever start playing?

01:20:42.317 --> 01:20:46.404
Frank
was killed in a fight.

01:20:46.488 --> 01:20:48.239
I am
sorry.

01:20:48.323 --> 01:20:53.411
My father always told me
fighting will not solve

01:20:53.495 --> 01:20:54.579
anything.

01:20:54.663 --> 01:20:57.248
Yes.

01:20:57.332 --> 01:21:02.962
So what brings you
here into Cincinnati?

01:21:03.046 --> 01:21:06.800
I just
joined a

01:21:06.883 --> 01:21:10.762
professional baseball team in
Oshkosh.

01:21:10.845 --> 01:21:13.598
That's quite a long ways away.

01:21:13.682 --> 01:21:16.601
Yes.
Yes, it is.

01:21:16.685 --> 01:21:18.937
Shouldn't you be
there?

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:21.982
No.
I mean yes.

01:21:22.065 --> 01:21:25.151
I mean I should be there in two
weeks.

01:21:25.235 --> 01:21:30.824
So you have
business in Cincinnati?

01:21:30.907 --> 01:21:35.120
No.
It's just that...

01:21:35.203 --> 01:21:37.956
well, you've been on my mind.

01:21:43.378 --> 01:21:47.841
This is a
beautiful place.

01:21:47.924 --> 01:21:51.177
Yes, really, this
is a very

01:21:51.261 --> 01:21:53.096
special place for me.

01:21:54.556 --> 01:21:57.809
I think you should
consider

01:21:57.892 --> 01:22:00.520
learning how to use your voice.

01:22:00.603 --> 01:22:02.981
What good would it do me?

01:22:03.064 --> 01:22:07.819
People would look
at you differently.

01:22:07.902 --> 01:22:10.655
The only
way they

01:22:10.739 --> 01:22:14.326
look at me different is when I
play baseball well.

01:22:14.409 --> 01:22:20.332
I feel that
would change if you spoke.

01:22:20.415 --> 01:22:23.001
Half of
the players

01:22:23.084 --> 01:22:24.836
don't even try to talk to me.

01:22:24.919 --> 01:22:26.171
They're afraid.

01:22:26.254 --> 01:22:27.881
Of what?

01:22:27.964 --> 01:22:31.176
Someone with a
handicap

01:22:31.259 --> 01:22:33.011
is better than them.

01:22:33.094 --> 01:22:36.848
I've
never felt

01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:39.017
that my inability to

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.061
hear is a handicap.
In fact, it is often an asset.

01:22:41.144 --> 01:22:42.687
Uh-huh.

01:22:42.771 --> 01:22:45.357
I can
feel the tiniest

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:48.526
foul tip touching my bat.
I know when I hit a ball

01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:51.196
that it will leave the ballpark
or just be a single.

01:22:51.279 --> 01:22:53.531
And when I'm on base, I have my
own secret

01:22:53.615 --> 01:23:00.622
way of knowing what the batter
is going to hit.

01:23:04.125 --> 01:23:11.716
I
know if a runner is going to try

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:17.889
to run.
And the crowds...

01:23:17.972 --> 01:23:19.099
Mhm-hmh.

01:23:19.182 --> 01:23:24.062
Well, I
can see the

01:23:24.145 --> 01:23:29.901
look in their eyes when they
like what I've done

01:23:29.985 --> 01:23:35.907
or even if they don't.
I feel their energy when

01:23:35.991 --> 01:23:41.913
they stand and wave their arms
and hats at me.

01:23:41.997 --> 01:23:49.004
The other players hear them
cheer, but me, I get

01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:56.553
to feel them.

01:24:00.515 --> 01:24:05.937
It's late. I should go.

01:24:06.021 --> 01:24:09.107
Just think about
what I said.

01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:12.110
I will.

01:24:12.193 --> 01:24:16.614
Will I see you
again, Mr. Hoy?

01:24:16.698 --> 01:24:23.705
In time
you will.

01:24:34.549 --> 01:24:35.633
Hi.

01:24:35.717 --> 01:24:37.469
Hi.

01:24:37.552 --> 01:24:41.639
Your father told me
that you're

01:24:41.723 --> 01:24:45.143
going to play professional
baseball.

01:24:45.226 --> 01:24:51.024
He seems very proud of you.

01:24:51.107 --> 01:24:57.155
I wanted to see you, to tell you

01:24:57.238 --> 01:25:02.994
I'm sorry about my father.

01:25:03.078 --> 01:25:06.331
It would
never have

01:25:06.414 --> 01:25:08.333
worked.
We're different.

01:25:08.416 --> 01:25:10.502
It would have
worked

01:25:10.585 --> 01:25:12.170
if not for my father.

01:25:12.253 --> 01:25:16.007
Not just
your father,

01:25:16.091 --> 01:25:18.510
everyone sees me different.

01:25:18.593 --> 01:25:23.598
I don't.

01:25:31.606 --> 01:25:38.196
Son of a...

01:25:38.279 --> 01:25:40.031
Get in here.

01:25:40.115 --> 01:25:41.908
Oof!
Get your hands...

01:25:41.992 --> 01:25:43.535
Hold your tongue,
Mister.

01:25:43.618 --> 01:25:46.204
You listen to me,
you listen to me good.

01:25:46.287 --> 01:25:48.873
I'm a God-fearing man.

01:25:48.957 --> 01:25:49.916
Oh, I am.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.710
But if I ever catch you near my
son,

01:25:51.793 --> 01:25:53.253
if I ever catch you calling

01:25:53.336 --> 01:25:55.714
him a freak again,
may God help you.

01:25:55.797 --> 01:25:58.383
What I'm gonna do to you...
Give me that.

01:25:58.466 --> 01:25:59.634
Don't!

01:25:59.718 --> 01:26:00.552
There's no... stop it!

01:26:00.635 --> 01:26:03.221
There's no value in this.
You understand me?

01:26:03.304 --> 01:26:04.305
Now, get yourself right.

01:26:22.991 --> 01:26:27.412
Yeah.
I know, I know, I know, I know.

01:26:27.495 --> 01:26:33.918
I taught you fighting is never
the answer.

01:26:34.002 --> 01:26:39.591
Sometimes you just gotta
convince certain people

01:26:39.674 --> 01:26:46.097
what they're doing is wrong.
It's wrong. You understand?

01:26:46.181 --> 01:26:53.438
That's my boy, huh.
Hey, you hungry? Huh? Come on.

01:26:53.521 --> 01:26:56.816
I put
a lot of money into this team.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.611
I fought hard to get back in the
National League.

01:26:59.694 --> 01:27:01.946
Yes, sir; I
know.

01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:04.449
I feel we have a winning team
this season.

01:27:04.532 --> 01:27:07.786
- Do you?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:07.869 --> 01:27:08.787
I had a scout in

01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:10.163
Oshkosh who told me of a new guy

01:27:10.246 --> 01:27:14.626
that could catch, throw,
who's as quick as a panther.

01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:18.505
A deaf and dumb kid by
the name of Dummy Hoy.

01:27:18.588 --> 01:27:21.132
You ever hear of him?

01:27:21.216 --> 01:27:22.676
Uh, yeah, I
heard of him.

01:27:22.759 --> 01:27:24.469
Yeah, you're
damn right you heard of him.

01:27:24.552 --> 01:27:27.347
He was here with my team,
sent by Dooley.

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:28.431
What the hell happened?

01:27:28.515 --> 01:27:31.643
Well, see, he
...he...

01:27:31.726 --> 01:27:33.645
he was asking for $65 a month.

01:27:33.728 --> 01:27:35.146
I figured you didn't want to pay
that

01:27:35.230 --> 01:27:36.356
much for no deaf and dumb
player.

01:27:36.439 --> 01:27:37.983
Do you realize
that this

01:27:38.066 --> 01:27:39.484
boy played on the Ohio
Independents?

01:27:39.567 --> 01:27:40.652
Do you know who they are?

01:27:40.735 --> 01:27:42.195
No, sir.

01:27:42.278 --> 01:27:43.488
Yeah. Well,
if you did, you'd've signed him.

01:27:43.571 --> 01:27:45.323
The Ohio Independents is a
baseball team

01:27:45.407 --> 01:27:47.200
out of a deaf and dumb school in
Columbus.

01:27:47.283 --> 01:27:49.327
They embarked on a statewide
barnstorming tour,

01:27:49.411 --> 01:27:51.496
taking on several National
League clubs,

01:27:51.579 --> 01:27:53.164
and they fared extremely well.

01:27:53.248 --> 01:27:54.624
I didn't know
he was a real player.

01:27:54.708 --> 01:27:55.542
- I thought...
- Yeah.

01:27:55.625 --> 01:27:56.793
Now, I want him back!

01:27:56.876 --> 01:27:58.336
I... I... you go to Oshkosh, you
get him back.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:27:59.546
I don't care what it costs.

01:27:59.629 --> 01:28:02.382
65, 75, 85, I don't care,
I want him back.

01:28:02.465 --> 01:28:03.675
But, sir, I
told him that...

01:28:03.758 --> 01:28:05.218
What, are you
deaf?

01:28:05.301 --> 01:28:11.182
Maybe I'm paying you too much.
You go get him. You hear me?

01:28:11.266 --> 01:28:17.564
Okay.
I'll bring him back.

01:28:17.647 --> 01:28:19.691
And don't go
over 85.

01:28:19.774 --> 01:28:21.693
Yes, sir.

01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:24.029
Quisling.

01:28:24.112 --> 01:28:26.281
Jackass.

01:28:27.782 --> 01:28:29.200
All right, boys.
I'm here to

01:28:29.284 --> 01:28:30.869
get the stats on all 'ya.
I'll make it quick.

01:28:30.952 --> 01:28:33.038
Kinzie, I'll start with you.
I need your age, height,

01:28:33.121 --> 01:28:34.080
- And weight.
- Nah, nah, nah.

01:28:34.164 --> 01:28:37.375
You start with the new kid down
there.

01:28:37.459 --> 01:28:42.255
All right.
All right, kid, let's have it.

01:28:42.339 --> 01:28:44.591
Hey, kid, I ain't got all day.

01:28:44.674 --> 01:28:46.217
Hey, kid, what are you, deaf?

01:28:46.301 --> 01:28:47.761
Yeah, he is.

01:28:47.844 --> 01:28:49.721
- Lay off him, Kinzie.
- Ah, come on, Krock.

01:28:49.804 --> 01:28:52.891
I'm just having a little fun
with the new kid, that's all.

01:28:52.974 --> 01:28:54.225
You're kidding,
right?

01:28:54.309 --> 01:28:57.604
Nope.
Can't hear or talk.

01:28:57.687 --> 01:29:00.231
Ain't that right, you dummy?

01:29:00.315 --> 01:29:01.399
What's his name?

01:29:01.483 --> 01:29:03.360
Who cares what his
name is?

01:29:03.652 --> 01:29:05.570
If you ask me, he doesn't belong
here.

01:29:05.654 --> 01:29:07.405
I told you lay off 'im.

01:29:07.489 --> 01:29:08.948
What do you mean?

01:29:09.032 --> 01:29:13.745
I mean baseball is
no place for dummies like him.

01:29:13.828 --> 01:29:15.080
Well, you're
here.

01:29:16.373 --> 01:29:17.749
Oh, that's real
funny, Krock.

01:29:17.832 --> 01:29:18.792
That's real funny.

01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:21.961
Laugh it up, smart ass, laugh it
up.

01:29:22.045 --> 01:29:29.260
I need your
stats.

01:29:29.344 --> 01:29:32.597
I need your...

01:29:32.681 --> 01:29:34.057
I'll come back to you.

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:36.768
Like I'm supposed to stand here
and trade notes all day.

01:29:36.851 --> 01:29:38.937
Kinzie, might as well give me
yours.

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.772
Yeah, might as
well.

01:29:40.855 --> 01:29:45.110
Age 41. Height one sixty.
Just kiddin'.

01:29:45.193 --> 01:29:48.279
Six foot.
Weight one sixty.

01:29:48.363 --> 01:29:52.784
And I'm a hell of a ball player.

01:29:52.867 --> 01:29:53.952
How about you,
Bishop?

01:29:54.035 --> 01:29:55.662
Okay, boys, up and
at 'em.

01:29:55.745 --> 01:29:56.955
Game time.

01:29:57.038 --> 01:30:00.792
Let's go. Let's get out there.

01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:07.132
Dummy. Dummy. Dummy. You.
No, no. You come with me.

01:30:07.215 --> 01:30:09.509
You come with me.

01:30:09.592 --> 01:30:15.890
No, no, no, no, no. No. No.
You come with me.

01:30:34.743 --> 01:30:37.662
Mr.
Hoy.

01:30:37.746 --> 01:30:38.913
Frank.

01:30:38.997 --> 01:30:43.168
Gentlemen, we are prepared to
offer Mr. Hoy

01:30:43.251 --> 01:30:47.047
$65 a month to play for
Milwaukee.

01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:50.675
He's already
getting 65.

01:30:50.759 --> 01:30:52.677
Then we'll
offer him 75.

01:30:52.761 --> 01:30:55.513
That will be up to
Mr.

01:30:55.597 --> 01:30:58.683
Hoy to
decide whether he will accept it

01:30:58.767 --> 01:30:59.601
or not.

01:31:06.274 --> 01:31:09.194
All right.

01:31:09.277 --> 01:31:16.951
Mr. Hoy, watch this.
We will pay you $75 a month.

01:31:35.679 --> 01:31:38.431
No, thank you.

01:31:38.515 --> 01:31:45.230
Okay. No problem.
No problem. I understand.

01:31:45.313 --> 01:31:50.235
Okay? Mr. Hoy, watch this.

01:31:50.318 --> 01:31:57.909
How does $85 a month sound?

01:31:57.993 --> 01:32:05.750
Oh. Look.

01:32:05.834 --> 01:32:10.839
I'm sorry, Frank.

01:32:14.175 --> 01:32:19.723
Oh, sure. That's 85.

01:32:42.746 --> 01:32:46.791
I wouldn't play for
your team for a million dollars.

01:32:53.548 --> 01:32:59.304
I think we're finished here.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:40.679
Strike one!

01:33:40.762 --> 01:33:43.014
Strike two!

01:33:45.934 --> 01:33:47.018
Strike three!

01:33:51.106 --> 01:33:54.359
You're out. Go.

01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:07.789
We'll get 'em next
time.

01:34:23.513 --> 01:34:26.141
Yeah! All right!
All right, Dummy!

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:33.481
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go.

01:34:39.029 --> 01:34:40.030
Nice throw!

01:34:43.033 --> 01:34:44.701
That's how it's done,
deaf boy.

01:34:49.164 --> 01:34:50.915
Yeah!

01:34:50.999 --> 01:34:55.170
All right!

01:35:05.555 --> 01:35:07.515
Strike one.

01:35:10.894 --> 01:35:11.978
Strike two.

01:35:12.062 --> 01:35:13.438
What are you saying?

01:35:20.362 --> 01:35:22.197
Strike three.
You're out.

01:35:22.739 --> 01:35:28.536
You're out.
You're out.

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.139
Strike one.
Strike two.

01:35:48.223 --> 01:35:49.808
Strike three.
You're out.

01:36:09.411 --> 01:36:10.996
Batter's out!

01:36:11.079 --> 01:36:13.999
Yeah!
Yeah, Dummy! Great catch!

01:36:14.082 --> 01:36:15.709
He didn't catch
that ball.

01:36:15.792 --> 01:36:17.752
He's deaf and dumb as they come.
Ain't no way he

01:36:17.836 --> 01:36:18.670
caught that ball.

01:36:18.753 --> 01:36:20.005
You're out!

01:36:20.088 --> 01:36:23.925
You better
think about it, Ump.

01:36:24.259 --> 01:36:27.178
Hey, Ump.
Ump, what's up?

01:36:27.262 --> 01:36:28.847
Where you goin'?

01:36:28.930 --> 01:36:32.350
Frank, I'm
takin' care of it.

01:36:32.434 --> 01:36:34.352
What are they
talkin' about?

01:36:34.436 --> 01:36:36.021
So kid, did you
catch that ball?

01:36:36.104 --> 01:36:37.355
Of course he caught
the ball.

01:36:37.439 --> 01:36:38.606
You saw it with your own eyes.

01:36:38.690 --> 01:36:40.692
I'm talkin' to
the boy here.

01:36:40.775 --> 01:36:42.193
The ball
hit the ground

01:36:42.277 --> 01:36:43.111
before I caught it.

01:36:43.445 --> 01:36:44.863
Thanks, kid.

01:36:44.946 --> 01:36:47.365
That's one honest ball
player right there, boys.

01:36:47.449 --> 01:36:49.075
All right.
Batter, take your base.

01:36:49.159 --> 01:36:50.869
He's safe? What?

01:36:50.952 --> 01:36:52.203
That's one dumb

01:36:52.287 --> 01:36:54.581
kid you got on your
team there, Kinz.

01:36:54.664 --> 01:36:56.207
He could've had me out.

01:36:56.291 --> 01:36:59.586
They ought to call y'all the
Oshkosh Dummies.

01:36:59.669 --> 01:37:02.714
Ahhh!
What's wrong with you, huh?

01:37:02.797 --> 01:37:05.133
Are you tryin' to lose the game
for us?

01:37:05.216 --> 01:37:06.051
Huh!?

01:37:06.134 --> 01:37:07.218
Back off him, Kinzie.

01:37:07.302 --> 01:37:08.386
Why are
you always

01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:09.387
sticking up for him?

01:37:09.471 --> 01:37:11.389
He ain't nothin' but a dumb
idiot!

01:37:11.473 --> 01:37:12.724
He didn't catch
the ball.

01:37:12.807 --> 01:37:16.061
You know it and I know it.
Now, get back to second.

01:37:16.144 --> 01:37:18.355
I ain't
done with

01:37:18.647 --> 01:37:20.482
you yet, deaf boy.
You got that?

01:37:40.001 --> 01:37:42.087
Okay. All right.

01:37:46.216 --> 01:37:49.094
Kinzie.
Kinzie, what are you doin'?

01:37:49.177 --> 01:37:53.264
What?
He didn't call for it.

01:37:53.348 --> 01:37:56.267
What? You gonna do
something, deaf boy?

01:37:56.351 --> 01:37:57.602
You gonna do
something?

01:37:57.686 --> 01:37:58.853
Boys!
William!

01:37:58.937 --> 01:38:00.772
That'll teach you
to mess with me.

01:38:00.855 --> 01:38:02.148
You understand that?

01:38:02.232 --> 01:38:03.274
You know fighting
is not the answer ever.

01:38:03.358 --> 01:38:05.819
No, you cannot do
that.

01:38:05.902 --> 01:38:10.031
Stay
outta my way!

01:38:28.383 --> 01:38:33.471
I want to commend
you for

01:38:33.555 --> 01:38:38.310
being so honest on the field
today.

01:38:38.393 --> 01:38:46.234
I would rather lose a game than
win it by cheating. Thank you.

01:39:02.917 --> 01:39:10.508
Get Kinzie in here.

01:39:20.644 --> 01:39:22.562
You boys need to
get some rest.

01:39:22.646 --> 01:39:25.523
We don't need rest.

01:39:25.607 --> 01:39:28.193
You need to
lay off the beer and cigars too.

01:39:28.276 --> 01:39:29.694
We're just
celebratin' our win.

01:39:29.778 --> 01:39:31.029
Yeah.
Why don't you

01:39:31.112 --> 01:39:32.572
include the deaf kid once in a
while?

01:39:32.656 --> 01:39:33.782
He ain't like us,
Frank.

01:39:33.865 --> 01:39:34.783
He don't fit in.

01:39:34.866 --> 01:39:36.368
I mean, even his name, Dummy
Hoy.

01:39:36.451 --> 01:39:37.869
You don't give him
a chance.

01:39:37.952 --> 01:39:38.912
C'mon, Frank.

01:39:38.995 --> 01:39:41.039
He got Kinzie kicked off the
team.

01:39:41.122 --> 01:39:45.710
Kinzie got
himself kicked off the team.

01:39:45.794 --> 01:39:48.880
Well, Dummy there could've
said he caught the ball.

01:39:48.963 --> 01:39:53.551
Is that how you
want to win, huh, by cheating?

01:39:53.635 --> 01:39:57.889
This kid has more heart than
I've ever seen in this game.

01:39:57.972 --> 01:40:00.392
Hey, we got heart.

01:40:00.475 --> 01:40:03.478
Then show it.

01:40:28.003 --> 01:40:32.966
That was for Kinzie.

01:40:33.049 --> 01:40:35.593
Fighting is never the
answer.

01:40:35.677 --> 01:40:37.637
Pope!
What the heck!

01:40:37.721 --> 01:40:39.764
This isn't football, you know.

01:40:39.848 --> 01:40:42.017
He didn't call for it!

01:40:57.866 --> 01:40:59.451
Fighting is never the
answer.

01:40:59.534 --> 01:41:01.453
Hey, Dummy, get out of
baseball!

01:41:01.536 --> 01:41:02.620
You don't belong here!

01:41:02.704 --> 01:41:04.789
Hey, guys, leave
him alone!

01:41:04.873 --> 01:41:06.791
Stay out of this, Kid!

01:41:06.875 --> 01:41:07.959
Just keep pitching the ball.

01:41:08.043 --> 01:41:10.462
Hey, knock it off
out there!

01:41:10.545 --> 01:41:13.006
He is not one of
us!

01:41:13.089 --> 01:41:15.800
He's just gettin' in the way!
You get someone who can hear!

01:41:15.884 --> 01:41:18.762
Get back to playing
baseball.

01:41:38.448 --> 01:41:41.034
Doesn't belong in
baseball, huh?

01:41:41.117 --> 01:41:43.244
Let's see one of you guys do
that.

01:41:44.454 --> 01:41:48.833
Gentlemen,
this year was a disaster for

01:41:48.917 --> 01:41:50.085
Oshkosh,

01:41:50.168 --> 01:41:53.004
and I do not intend that
it should happen again.

01:41:53.088 --> 01:41:58.718
Now, Frank, Mr. Porter and
Mr. Hollister and Mr. Choate

01:41:58.802 --> 01:42:02.180
have come to me with the
interest

01:42:02.263 --> 01:42:05.850
of putting together a winning
team,

01:42:05.934 --> 01:42:10.689
and we feel that you
have the ability to do so.

01:42:10.772 --> 01:42:12.732
I believe I do,
sir,

01:42:12.816 --> 01:42:14.025
with the right men.

01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:15.860
And we shall get
them for you.

01:42:15.944 --> 01:42:21.032
I'd like to bring in the best
men that you can find.

01:42:21.116 --> 01:42:23.535
There are some
players I'd like to keep, sir.

01:42:23.618 --> 01:42:25.203
Such as?

01:42:25.286 --> 01:42:29.708
Bishop, Krock, and
Dummy Hoy.

01:42:29.791 --> 01:42:33.044
Uhm.
Now, don't get me

01:42:33.128 --> 01:42:34.379
wrong, Frank.

01:42:34.462 --> 01:42:36.047
I like Dummy.

01:42:36.131 --> 01:42:39.884
He's honest, he's a great
outfielder,

01:42:39.968 --> 01:42:42.220
and he's fast as hell,

01:42:42.303 --> 01:42:47.225
but his batting is less than
desired.

01:42:47.309 --> 01:42:50.395
He's the best
outfielder I've ever seen.

01:42:50.478 --> 01:42:51.438
I agree.

01:42:51.521 --> 01:42:53.898
And a fly ball doesn't have a
chance

01:42:53.982 --> 01:42:56.443
in hell when he's in the
outfield.

01:42:56.526 --> 01:43:04.075
But I need hitters, Frank.

01:43:04.159 --> 01:43:07.746
They quick pitch
him because he can't hear.

01:43:07.829 --> 01:43:11.082
Maybe you could
work with

01:43:11.166 --> 01:43:12.375
him on that.

01:43:12.459 --> 01:43:18.423
But I don't care how good
he is in the outfield.

01:43:18.506 --> 01:43:25.096
If he doesn't hit,
I have no use for him. Huh?

01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:28.433
We need hitters.

01:43:28.516 --> 01:43:29.768
We'll figure it
out.

01:43:29.851 --> 01:43:32.145
Well, you better
figure out

01:43:32.228 --> 01:43:35.774
a way for the other fellows
to get along with him too.

01:43:35.857 --> 01:43:40.278
No more of this knocking him
down

01:43:40.362 --> 01:43:45.450
or I'll get rid of the whole lot
of 'em

01:43:45.533 --> 01:43:48.453
and replace 'em.
Hmh?

01:43:48.536 --> 01:43:52.707
Sit.
We need to talk.

01:43:59.089 --> 01:44:01.132
Okay.

01:44:01.216 --> 01:44:06.221
You're great in the field.
You're fast.

01:44:09.391 --> 01:44:14.396
You can throw like I've never
seen anyone throw before,

01:44:17.941 --> 01:44:20.986
maybe even better than King,

01:44:21.069 --> 01:44:27.158
but you're not hitting.

01:44:27.242 --> 01:44:28.326
I'm hitting.

01:44:28.410 --> 01:44:30.662
No, no, no.

01:44:30.745 --> 01:44:36.543
Your batting average is .219
this season.

01:44:36.626 --> 01:44:44.342
Mr. Sawyer wants it higher.

01:44:44.426 --> 01:44:52.267
If you don't start hitting,
I can't keep you.

01:45:01.609 --> 01:45:03.028
They're
quick pitching.

01:45:03.111 --> 01:45:04.279
Yes, I told them.

01:45:04.362 --> 01:45:06.448
I told them that.
I told them they're quick

01:45:06.531 --> 01:45:07.365
pitching you.

01:45:07.449 --> 01:45:11.995
They don't care. No.

01:45:14.956 --> 01:45:19.961
It's the way the game is played.

01:45:23.673 --> 01:45:30.722
Huh?
You have until next season to

01:45:30.805 --> 01:45:33.975
figure it out.

01:45:43.026 --> 01:45:45.612
I know you will.

01:45:45.695 --> 01:45:50.700
You are a great player,
and I'd hate losing you.

01:45:54.162 --> 01:45:59.167
I'll also tell the guys to not
run into you.

01:46:04.005 --> 01:46:07.050
Huh?

01:46:09.177 --> 01:46:17.018
Oh. No, no. You sure you want
to handle it? You? Okay.

01:46:24.693 --> 01:46:31.616
Mr. Hoy! It's a
pleasure to see you again.

01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:35.453
I want to learn to speak.

01:46:35.537 --> 01:46:43.044
I think I have
the right teacher for you.

01:46:47.716 --> 01:46:51.636
Are you paying any
attention?

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:55.807
Are you paying any attention?

01:46:55.890 --> 01:46:59.477
Mr.
Hoy, are you paying any

01:46:59.561 --> 01:47:00.979
attention?

01:47:01.062 --> 01:47:02.522
Mr. Hoy.

01:47:02.605 --> 01:47:04.190
What's
wrong?

01:47:04.274 --> 01:47:05.191
What's wrong?

01:47:05.275 --> 01:47:08.987
You are not paying any
attention.

01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:12.991
How do you expect to learn how
to speak

01:47:13.074 --> 01:47:15.660
if you don't pay any attention?

01:47:15.744 --> 01:47:21.207
Your beauty has overtaken me.

01:47:21.291 --> 01:47:25.670
Mr.
Hoy, unless I am mistaken,

01:47:25.754 --> 01:47:30.508
you have come here to learn how
to speak.

01:47:30.592 --> 01:47:32.344
Am I right?

01:47:32.427 --> 01:47:35.513
I think I
just did.

01:47:35.597 --> 01:47:37.057
Didn't you hear me?

01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:41.603
Mr. Hoy,
you're something else.

01:47:44.272 --> 01:47:50.862
Now, Mr. Hoy, I am going
to fingerspell a word

01:47:50.945 --> 01:47:55.033
and I want you to say it.

01:47:55.116 --> 01:48:02.999
B-A-S-E-B-A-L-L. Baseball.

01:48:33.989 --> 01:48:38.576
What are you up to?

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:41.454
You have an idea?

01:48:41.538 --> 01:48:43.498
What?

01:48:48.878 --> 01:48:49.838
Okay.

01:48:51.006 --> 01:48:52.757
- B.
- B.

01:48:52.841 --> 01:48:54.759
A.

01:48:54.843 --> 01:49:01.850
A. A-L-L. Ball.

01:49:03.685 --> 01:49:06.938
While I
am at bat, you

01:49:07.022 --> 01:49:09.149
spell ball from the sideline.

01:49:09.232 --> 01:49:10.442
Ball?

01:49:10.525 --> 01:49:13.987
And I
will look at you.

01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:15.572
Yeah.

01:49:17.907 --> 01:49:19.200
I swing.

01:49:19.284 --> 01:49:20.118
Yeah.
Okay.

01:49:20.201 --> 01:49:21.453
Bat. Bat.
Bat. Ball.

01:49:21.536 --> 01:49:22.954
You sign
three.

01:49:23.038 --> 01:49:26.291
Oh, wait.
Well, that...

01:49:26.374 --> 01:49:28.293
that's the base line.

01:49:28.376 --> 01:49:30.462
- B...
- Oh, I'm on the...

01:49:30.545 --> 01:49:32.964
I'm on the baseline.

01:49:33.048 --> 01:49:38.136
- B-A-L-L.
- B-A-L-L.

01:49:38.219 --> 01:49:44.726
Ah!

01:49:51.566 --> 01:49:53.652
Ball.

01:49:53.735 --> 01:49:57.405
B-A-L-L.

01:50:03.953 --> 01:50:06.498
Strike one.

01:50:06.581 --> 01:50:10.919
S-T-R-I-K-E.

01:50:49.791 --> 01:50:52.043
Z.

01:50:52.127 --> 01:50:54.879
Z.

01:50:54.963 --> 01:50:57.924
Your
name.

01:50:58.008 --> 01:50:59.718
Your name.

01:50:59.801 --> 01:51:02.887
K-R

01:51:02.971 --> 01:51:05.557
R-O

01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:11.479
C-K
TEAMMATES: C-K

01:51:12.689 --> 01:51:14.232
Your
name.

01:51:14.316 --> 01:51:15.567
My name?

01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:18.236
B-I

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:23.074
I-S-H

01:51:23.158 --> 01:51:27.662
O-P

01:51:47.182 --> 01:51:52.729
You can't see me in
the...

01:51:53.021 --> 01:51:54.606
in the fog.

01:51:54.689 --> 01:52:01.613
Well, you got any ideas?

01:52:13.708 --> 01:52:16.544
Strike!

01:52:30.058 --> 01:52:33.812
What is this?
Are you trying to bribe me, son?

01:52:33.895 --> 01:52:35.689
I can't take that.
I can't take it.

01:52:35.772 --> 01:52:37.983
C'mon, Ump,
let's play ball.

01:52:38.066 --> 01:52:40.568
Selee, get out
here.

01:52:42.904 --> 01:52:45.365
Is he trying to bribe me,
because if he is...

01:52:45.448 --> 01:52:48.493
Just read the
paper, Ump.

01:52:48.576 --> 01:52:49.786
Selee, if this
is a bribe,

01:52:49.869 --> 01:52:50.704
you two are out of the game.

01:52:50.787 --> 01:52:53.832
You got me?

01:52:53.915 --> 01:52:57.002
So you want me to raise my
right arm when I call a strike

01:52:57.085 --> 01:52:59.838
and my left arm when I call a
ball?

01:52:59.921 --> 01:53:01.006
What is this?

01:53:01.089 --> 01:53:03.341
Can you just do it
for him?

01:53:03.425 --> 01:53:05.385
I can't play
favoritism with this kid, Selee.

01:53:05.468 --> 01:53:07.512
Then do it for
everyone.

01:53:07.595 --> 01:53:09.848
You... you do know your right
from your left, don't you?

01:53:09.931 --> 01:53:11.141
Watch your
mouth, Selee.

01:53:11.224 --> 01:53:14.436
Just wanted to
know, that's all.

01:53:15.103 --> 01:53:16.688
All right.

01:53:16.771 --> 01:53:21.192
From now on, I'm gonna raise my
right arm when I call a strike.

01:53:21.276 --> 01:53:22.527
Is that even
legal?

01:53:22.610 --> 01:53:23.862
It's legal if
I say it's legal.

01:53:23.945 --> 01:53:25.405
Come on, ump.

01:53:25.488 --> 01:53:28.199
You can't show him favoritism
just 'cause he's a dumb kid.

01:53:28.283 --> 01:53:30.035
Then
I'll do it with everybody.

01:53:30.118 --> 01:53:31.536
Well, I don't
need it.

01:53:31.619 --> 01:53:32.871
These fellas out here don't need
it.

01:53:32.954 --> 01:53:34.205
You're just doin' it 'cause he's
a dumb,

01:53:34.289 --> 01:53:35.915
stupid kid that don't belong
here.

01:53:35.999 --> 01:53:37.792
I'm gonna
raise my left arm when

01:53:37.876 --> 01:53:38.710
I call a ball.

01:53:38.793 --> 01:53:42.630
Now, let's play ball.

01:53:51.014 --> 01:53:52.140
Strike one!

01:53:52.223 --> 01:53:53.391
See that?
It's a strike.

01:53:53.475 --> 01:53:54.643
Gonna be a lot of them today.

01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:20.585
Frank, we're
14 games behind Milwaukee.

01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:23.630
Now, don't get me wrong, Frank.

01:54:23.713 --> 01:54:25.590
I think you're doing an
excellent job.

01:54:25.674 --> 01:54:29.928
Even Dummy Hoy is batting over
.300.

01:54:30.011 --> 01:54:31.221
Yes, sir.

01:54:31.304 --> 01:54:34.265
But it's
just not coming together.

01:54:34.349 --> 01:54:35.266
We'll get it
together.

01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:38.436
I know. I know.

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.438
And just to be sure,

01:54:40.522 --> 01:54:43.108
I have secured

01:54:43.191 --> 01:54:48.613
Tom Lovett, Tug Wilson, Con
Murphy,

01:54:48.697 --> 01:54:51.950
and Tommy McCarthy.

01:54:52.033 --> 01:54:53.952
Oh, those are some
great players.

01:54:54.035 --> 01:54:55.745
Yeah.

01:54:55.829 --> 01:54:57.580
Well, speculation

01:54:57.664 --> 01:54:59.624
has it that Secretary Quinn
has somehow

01:54:59.708 --> 01:55:04.462
convinced the umpires in
Milwaukee to,

01:55:04.546 --> 01:55:08.299
shall we say, favor Milwaukee.

01:55:08.383 --> 01:55:15.140
Now, I need you and the boys to
give it all you've got.

01:55:15.223 --> 01:55:16.641
Am I clear?

01:55:16.725 --> 01:55:18.143
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

01:55:18.226 --> 01:55:22.939
Frank, by the way, this running
into Dummy Hoy will stop.

01:55:26.901 --> 01:55:28.320
He wants to deal
with it himself.

01:55:28.403 --> 01:55:30.322
He asked me not to say anything.

01:55:30.405 --> 01:55:35.327
Well, you keep an
eye on it.

01:55:35.410 --> 01:55:39.748
Huh?

01:55:44.294 --> 01:55:45.837
It's great to
meet 'ya.

01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:47.380
Man, you've played some great
ball.

01:55:47.464 --> 01:55:50.216
I bet you're gonna be remembered
as one of the best players.

01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:52.010
You too.

01:55:52.093 --> 01:55:54.679
Me?
No.

01:55:54.763 --> 01:55:58.767
I play good.
You, you play great.

01:56:34.969 --> 01:56:37.889
To avoid
collisions in the

01:56:37.972 --> 01:56:39.391
outfield, from now on,

01:56:39.474 --> 01:56:42.227
when I am fielding a fly ball,

01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:46.731
I will make a squealing sound
so

01:56:46.815 --> 01:56:50.068
the other players will back off.

01:56:50.151 --> 01:56:53.071
You really think that's gonna
help?

01:56:53.154 --> 01:56:56.741
You read that?

01:56:56.825 --> 01:57:00.745
It ain't gonna happen.

01:57:00.829 --> 01:57:03.081
Anybody touches
Dummy Hoy again,

01:57:03.164 --> 01:57:07.335
they're gonna be dealing with
me.

01:57:09.045 --> 01:57:12.424
Is that right, Tommy?

01:57:12.507 --> 01:57:16.761
- And me.
- And me.

01:57:16.845 --> 01:57:20.223
That goes for me
too.

01:57:26.021 --> 01:57:27.605
Let's go
play some ball, boys.

01:57:27.689 --> 01:57:31.026
Yeah! Let's win one!

01:57:37.907 --> 01:57:44.289
Y-Z.

01:57:44.372 --> 01:57:50.253
I'll be right back.
Keep practicing.

01:58:01.056 --> 01:58:02.640
Okay.
Listen up, boys.

01:58:02.724 --> 01:58:05.143
I've scheduled an extra
exhibition game

01:58:05.226 --> 01:58:07.187
for us while we're in Des
Moines.

01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:09.481
You're killin' us,
Frank.

01:58:09.564 --> 01:58:11.816
Ah?
We need the practice.

01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:13.818
Besides, Sawyer made it very
clear he didn't

01:58:13.902 --> 01:58:15.487
want to lose the pennant this
year.

01:58:15.570 --> 01:58:16.738
Where's Dummy?

01:58:16.821 --> 01:58:18.031
- I
- think he went to the can.

01:58:18.114 --> 01:58:21.826
Just let him
know about the game.

01:58:42.263 --> 01:58:43.515
Where the hell's
Dummy?

01:58:43.598 --> 01:58:46.059
I think he's still upstairs,
coach.

01:58:46.142 --> 01:58:48.061
Well, you
blockheads did

01:58:48.144 --> 01:58:50.188
tell him about the game, didn't
you?

01:58:50.271 --> 01:58:52.190
Tug, you're the
outfielder.

01:58:52.273 --> 01:58:54.359
Beeler, did you not tell
him?

01:58:54.442 --> 01:58:56.361
All right.
All right.

01:58:56.444 --> 01:58:57.570
All right.
Go on up.

01:58:57.654 --> 01:58:58.863
Go on.
Go get him.

01:59:08.623 --> 01:59:10.709
- Is this him over here?
- Yeah.

01:59:10.792 --> 01:59:11.918
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59:13.461 --> 01:59:15.922
Hoy! Man, we got a game.
Come on, wake up!

01:59:16.006 --> 01:59:18.383
Hey, kid, do us
a favor.

01:59:18.466 --> 01:59:20.927
Climb through the transom
and wake up our buddy, okay?

01:59:21.011 --> 01:59:23.221
If he ain't answerin',
how you know he's in there?

01:59:23.304 --> 01:59:25.724
He's deaf, you see?

01:59:25.807 --> 01:59:27.225
I don't know.
My boss wouldn't

01:59:27.309 --> 01:59:28.393
want me breaking in a room.

01:59:28.476 --> 01:59:29.894
You're not breaking
in.

01:59:29.978 --> 01:59:31.021
We're giving you permission.

01:59:31.104 --> 01:59:31.938
Yeah.

01:59:32.022 --> 01:59:33.398
Who are you guys?

01:59:33.481 --> 01:59:35.400
We're the Oshkosh
baseball club,

01:59:35.483 --> 01:59:37.068
and that's Dummy Hoy.

01:59:37.152 --> 01:59:39.738
Dummy Hoy?
He's a great center fielder.

01:59:39.821 --> 01:59:41.906
Yes, he is,
and we have a game.

01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:44.075
Well, hey, boost me up
here.

01:59:44.159 --> 01:59:45.201
Team: Let's do this.

01:59:52.667 --> 01:59:55.295
He's in there all
right.

01:59:55.378 --> 02:00:01.134
Can you squeeze in
there?

02:00:01.217 --> 02:00:03.762
I ain't gettin'
through.

02:00:03.845 --> 02:00:08.641
Get him...
let's get 'im down.

02:00:08.725 --> 02:00:10.226
Get 'im down.

02:00:14.230 --> 02:00:18.485
I've got an idea.

02:00:18.568 --> 02:00:24.282
Give me a plug.

02:00:26.368 --> 02:00:27.202
Give me... give me
another plug.

02:00:27.285 --> 02:00:28.119
Give me another plug.

02:00:28.203 --> 02:00:31.623
That's twice, Con.

02:00:31.706 --> 02:00:36.086
Oh.

02:00:54.437 --> 02:00:55.313
Here.
Here.

02:00:55.397 --> 02:00:56.815
Try that.
You hold the string.

02:00:56.898 --> 02:00:58.274
You hold the string.

02:00:58.358 --> 02:01:01.027
- You got it?
- No, I don't know

02:01:01.111 --> 02:01:02.153
where it ends.

02:01:02.237 --> 02:01:06.825
- Come on, you guys.
- Go, go, go.

02:01:06.908 --> 02:01:07.993
Got 'im.
Got 'im.

02:01:08.076 --> 02:01:09.160
Bring it...
reel it in.

02:01:09.244 --> 02:01:10.453
Fish him in.

02:01:10.537 --> 02:01:13.331
- I'm tryin'. I'm tryin'.
- Reel him in.

02:01:13.415 --> 02:01:15.166
Reel him in.
Here we go.

02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:20.338
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.094
Wow!

02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:38.356
The Washington
Nationals are wanting you

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:42.444
to play for them next year.

02:01:47.282 --> 02:01:49.367
Me?

02:01:49.451 --> 02:01:53.580
Yes, you.

02:01:53.663 --> 02:01:56.541
You really showed 'em, Dummy.

02:01:56.624 --> 02:02:00.211
You're a great player.
You're a great player!

02:02:00.295 --> 02:02:02.797
Thank you.

02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:13.308
Follow your
dreams!

02:02:44.506 --> 02:02:46.758
The Washington
Nationals

02:02:46.841 --> 02:02:48.968
want me to play for them next
year.

02:02:49.052 --> 02:02:51.096
Wow! That's great!

02:02:51.179 --> 02:02:53.932
Yes, it is.

02:02:54.015 --> 02:02:58.269
Why do you love
baseball so much?

02:02:58.353 --> 02:03:03.608
It's one place
I feel I can do anything.

02:03:03.692 --> 02:03:09.948
When I'm running bases or
out in the field, nothing

02:03:10.031 --> 02:03:11.116
matters.

02:03:11.199 --> 02:03:17.789
Well, almost.

02:03:17.872 --> 02:03:19.791
What is it?

02:03:19.874 --> 02:03:22.794
Some of the guys
blame me

02:03:22.877 --> 02:03:26.464
for getting our captain kicked
off the team.

02:03:26.548 --> 02:03:34.014
Now they run into me,
making me miss fly balls.

02:03:34.097 --> 02:03:38.476
You need to stand
up for yourself.

02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:41.354
I'm trying to
figure out a way.

02:03:41.438 --> 02:03:45.150
You should fight
back.

02:03:45.233 --> 02:03:48.987
Fighting doesn't
solve anything.

02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:53.074
You should know that since
your brother was killed in one.

02:03:58.747 --> 02:04:04.836
Mr.
Hoy, my brother did not die in

02:04:04.919 --> 02:04:05.879
vain.

02:04:05.962 --> 02:04:12.218
When I was young, my mother
died.

02:04:12.302 --> 02:04:17.432
My father began drinking.

02:04:26.608 --> 02:04:32.364
Pa, why are we
here?

02:04:32.447 --> 02:04:36.076
I can't do it
anymore, boy.

02:04:36.159 --> 02:04:39.704
Ever since your mom died,
I can't take care of you.

02:04:39.788 --> 02:04:40.872
Anna's doin'
good.

02:04:40.955 --> 02:04:41.998
We listen to her.

02:04:42.082 --> 02:04:44.042
I know, but Anna's
deaf now

02:04:44.125 --> 02:04:46.544
and there's things she can't do
for ya.

02:04:46.628 --> 02:04:47.712
Pa, this ain't
right.

02:04:47.796 --> 02:04:48.880
Listen to me, boy.

02:04:48.963 --> 02:04:51.549
I can't take care of you
anymore,

02:04:51.633 --> 02:04:53.593
and it's not fair to Anna.

02:04:53.677 --> 02:04:54.761
I ain't goin'.

02:04:54.844 --> 02:04:56.262
Please, Pa.
I don't

02:04:56.346 --> 02:04:58.056
wanna go either.
I want to stay with you.

02:04:58.139 --> 02:05:02.227
- Me too, Pa.
- It'll be all right.

02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:07.774
We'll be together. Let's not
make this hard on Pa.

02:05:07.857 --> 02:05:14.406
- Frank. Frank!
- What?

02:05:14.489 --> 02:05:18.576
I'm sorry.

02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:22.872
Go on.

02:05:36.553 --> 02:05:39.431
Ah, Mr. Lowery.
Good afternoon.

02:05:39.514 --> 02:05:42.267
And these must be your children.

02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:44.311
Yes, ma'am; they
are.

02:05:44.394 --> 02:05:46.521
And are you
willing to surrender them?

02:05:49.190 --> 02:05:50.650
Yes, I am.

02:05:50.734 --> 02:05:52.944
It will be all
right, Fredrick.

02:05:53.028 --> 02:05:54.779
Pa, don't do this.

02:05:54.863 --> 02:05:56.281
Mrs.
McCall will assist

02:05:56.364 --> 02:05:57.615
you in filling out the forms,

02:05:57.699 --> 02:06:02.120
and Dr. Lattler will be
examining the children.

02:06:02.203 --> 02:06:04.664
My daughter is...
is deaf.

02:06:04.748 --> 02:06:08.626
Oh. And how
long has she been deaf?

02:06:08.710 --> 02:06:10.628
Ah.
A few years now.

02:06:10.712 --> 02:06:13.340
She took fever after her mother
died.

02:06:13.423 --> 02:06:16.509
Well, we'll
send her to the deaf school.

02:06:16.593 --> 02:06:17.886
No!

02:06:17.969 --> 02:06:19.971
You're not taking our sister.
She's all we have now.

02:06:20.055 --> 02:06:21.973
But she needs special
care, son.

02:06:22.057 --> 02:06:23.641
You ain't taking
her.

02:06:23.725 --> 02:06:24.768
Frank, what's
wrong?

02:06:24.851 --> 02:06:26.478
They want to
separate us.

02:06:26.561 --> 02:06:28.480
No!
Why can't we be together?

02:06:28.563 --> 02:06:29.981
I'm not goin'
anywhere.

02:06:30.065 --> 02:06:31.691
- This is a mistake.
- Mr.

02:06:31.775 --> 02:06:33.193
Lowery, please control your
children.

02:06:33.276 --> 02:06:34.653
You're not
splitting us up!

02:06:34.736 --> 02:06:37.155
We're not doing anything!
You're not taking us!

02:06:37.238 --> 02:06:39.991
Mr. Lowery,
please control your son.

02:06:40.075 --> 02:06:41.993
No! Pa, please.

02:06:42.077 --> 02:06:45.664
Catherine,
I am sorry. I... I failed you.

02:06:45.747 --> 02:06:47.999
Orderlies,
we need some help here, please.

02:06:48.083 --> 02:06:49.042
No!
You're not doing this!

02:06:49.125 --> 02:06:50.085
Mrs.
McCall, take Mr...

02:06:50.168 --> 02:06:51.211
... Lowery to the
office.

02:06:51.294 --> 02:06:52.128
Please don't do
this, Pa!

02:06:52.212 --> 02:06:53.672
Thank you very much.

02:06:53.755 --> 02:06:56.007
- Get off of me!
- YoT can't do this.

02:06:56.091 --> 02:06:57.300
No!

02:06:57.384 --> 02:06:58.218
Come with me.

02:06:58.301 --> 02:06:59.177
No, Fredrick,
don't go.

02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:02.764
- No.
- No. No.

02:07:02.847 --> 02:07:03.682
No.

02:07:03.765 --> 02:07:04.808
Anna Lowery: Wait!
Wait!

02:07:04.891 --> 02:07:05.725
Wait!
No!

02:07:05.809 --> 02:07:07.686
I want my sister!

02:07:07.769 --> 02:07:10.271
Anna!

02:07:12.983 --> 02:07:20.407
My brother hates anyone who
drinks.

02:07:20.490 --> 02:07:25.370
One day he saw a man who was
drunk

02:07:25.453 --> 02:07:28.873
beating up his daughter,

02:07:28.957 --> 02:07:31.876
confronts him.

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:38.216
The man took out his knife,
stabs him.

02:07:38.299 --> 02:07:41.219
The man was arrested.

02:07:41.302 --> 02:07:48.435
The girl was taken by a loving
family

02:07:48.518 --> 02:07:54.399
and is safe because of Frank.

02:07:54.482 --> 02:08:01.239
I'm not saying I agree with
fighting.

02:08:01.323 --> 02:08:06.745
Sometimes you have to stand up
for what you believe in.

02:08:06.828 --> 02:08:11.249
I'm sorry, I didn't
know.

02:08:11.333 --> 02:08:17.756
But if I fight back, they will
say

02:08:17.839 --> 02:08:24.012
the deaf man started the fight.

02:08:26.348 --> 02:08:31.603
Use your voice, Mr.
Hoy.

02:08:31.686 --> 02:08:34.814
Stand up for yourself.

02:08:34.898 --> 02:08:37.275
Is there a problem?

02:08:37.359 --> 02:08:39.778
Only one.

02:08:39.861 --> 02:08:42.614
What is it?

02:08:42.697 --> 02:08:49.037
I won't be able to
come to Cincinnati much.

02:08:50.705 --> 02:08:52.332
Oh.

02:08:52.415 --> 02:08:57.629
Who will teach me
to speak?

02:08:57.712 --> 02:09:03.009
I'm sure someone at
Gallaudet College

02:09:03.093 --> 02:09:07.972
will help you with your voice.

02:09:08.056 --> 02:09:12.310
I was thinking of
another way.

02:09:12.394 --> 02:09:15.146
What is it?

02:09:15.230 --> 02:09:21.903
I would like it
if you would marry me.

02:09:26.408 --> 02:09:30.161
Are you proposing
to me?

02:09:30.245 --> 02:09:36.835
I am, Miss Lowery.

02:09:36.918 --> 02:09:41.840
You'll have to talk
to

02:09:41.923 --> 02:09:44.509
Mr.
Crouse and Mr.

02:09:44.592 --> 02:09:45.593
Green

02:09:45.677 --> 02:09:49.347
since I'm a ward of a children's
home.

02:09:49.431 --> 02:09:56.062
I'm aware of that.
I'm willing to meet both

02:09:56.146 --> 02:09:57.397
gentlemen.

02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:03.028
And you may also
tell Mr.

02:10:03.111 --> 02:10:04.362
Shipley.

02:10:04.446 --> 02:10:09.451
I will meet all of
them if I have to.

02:10:12.787 --> 02:10:18.877
So you are a
baseball player?

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.212
Yes, sir.

02:10:21.296 --> 02:10:24.382
Hmmm. I see.

02:10:24.466 --> 02:10:30.930
Will you make a good salary?

02:10:31.014 --> 02:10:34.934
I already
do.

02:10:35.018 --> 02:10:42.734
Mrs. McCall: He is said to be
a man of honor and high morals.

02:10:42.817 --> 02:10:45.779
Yes, I have read
that about Mr. Hoy.

02:10:45.862 --> 02:10:49.366
Does everyone accept him?

02:10:52.827 --> 02:10:54.746
This is a grueling
final championship game

02:10:54.829 --> 02:10:57.415
between Oshkosh and Milwaukee.

02:10:57.499 --> 02:11:01.086
Whoever wins this game
will win the pennant.

02:11:01.169 --> 02:11:02.796
As you can see, folks, the
umpire is

02:11:02.879 --> 02:11:04.589
using his hands that the
deaf-mute

02:11:04.673 --> 02:11:07.550
Dummy Hoy asked him to use so
he could know what

02:11:07.634 --> 02:11:08.593
the calls were.

02:11:08.677 --> 02:11:12.138
That's right, folks, a right
hand up means a strike,

02:11:12.222 --> 02:11:16.643
while raising the left hand
indicates a ball.

02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:34.953
It's some game we
have out there!

02:11:35.036 --> 02:11:37.539
Hit after hit on both sides.
What a battle!

02:11:38.915 --> 02:11:43.712
Both teams obviously
wanting this championship.

02:11:46.256 --> 02:11:50.635
Look at the speed this deaf-mute
has.

02:11:50.719 --> 02:11:53.805
He's safe, folks!

02:11:53.888 --> 02:11:56.641
And Oshkosh
takes the lead eight to seven.

02:12:19.748 --> 02:12:20.832
Strike!

02:12:20.915 --> 02:12:23.168
Hey, come on!

02:12:23.251 --> 02:12:24.210
You're not
gonna hit .300...

02:12:24.294 --> 02:12:25.378
Hey, man, let's
go!

02:12:25.462 --> 02:12:26.296
By holding

02:12:26.379 --> 02:12:27.213
the bat on your shoulder.
Swing the bat.

02:12:27.297 --> 02:12:28.131
We don't win,
this is gonna be your hide,

02:12:28.214 --> 02:12:29.049
you know that.

02:12:29.132 --> 02:12:29.966
This is the -T the most
important game of the season.

02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:31.301
You know that!

02:12:31.384 --> 02:12:32.344
Hey!
We're gonna win the game.

02:12:32.427 --> 02:12:33.386
Yeah?
Promise me?

02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:34.929
Yes, I
promise.

02:12:36.973 --> 02:12:38.141
StrTke!

02:12:38.224 --> 02:12:42.771
Strike?
You broke your promise.

02:12:50.779 --> 02:12:52.072
- All right!
- Atta boy.

02:12:52.155 --> 02:12:53.907
- Atta boy. Atta boy.
- That's the way.

02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:57.661
And Milwaukee
has a man on first.

02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:07.212
And there's a high

02:13:07.295 --> 02:13:08.755
fly to centerfield

02:13:08.838 --> 02:13:11.216
Dummy's underneath it. Looks like
he's got it for an out.

02:13:11.466 --> 02:13:13.718
Wait! Pope ran into Dummy
and he dropped the ball.

02:13:13.802 --> 02:13:14.678
- Aha.
- All right!

02:13:14.761 --> 02:13:15.929
See?
Come on.

02:13:16.012 --> 02:13:17.263
That man is our
secret weapon.

02:13:17.347 --> 02:13:18.640
We're glad
we don't have him.

02:13:18.723 --> 02:13:19.557
All right.

02:13:19.641 --> 02:13:20.475
He's helping
us out.

02:13:20.558 --> 02:13:21.393
For now, all
right.

02:13:21.476 --> 02:13:23.144
Two outs.

02:13:27.857 --> 02:13:30.735
I thought
you had a handle on that.

02:13:30.819 --> 02:13:32.404
Dummy wants to
handle it.

02:13:32.487 --> 02:13:33.905
Well, when is that
gonna be?

02:13:33.989 --> 02:13:39.911
I don't want to lose this game.
I want the pennant.

02:13:39.995 --> 02:13:43.581
Fighting is never the
answer.

02:13:43.665 --> 02:13:46.459
Use your
voice, Mr.

02:13:46.543 --> 02:13:48.503
Hoy.
Stand up for yourself.

02:13:50.046 --> 02:13:55.760
Sometimes you just
gotta convince certain people

02:13:55.844 --> 02:13:58.304
what they're doing is wrong.
It's wrong!

02:13:58.388 --> 02:13:59.764
Fight back.

02:14:04.019 --> 02:14:06.021
Oh, my goodness,
what's going

02:14:06.104 --> 02:14:06.938
on out there?

02:14:07.022 --> 02:14:09.357
Enough?

02:14:16.531 --> 02:14:18.450
Let's win this!

02:14:18.533 --> 02:14:21.786
If this keeps up,
Oshkosh will lose for sure!

02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:23.288
Way to go, Dummy!
Way to go!

02:14:23.371 --> 02:14:26.333
Great, bases
loaded

02:14:26.416 --> 02:14:29.711
and Milwaukee's best hitter is
up.

02:14:37.552 --> 02:14:40.972
With bases loaded,
there's a hit. It's agood one!

02:14:41.056 --> 02:14:42.682
It's going! It's going!

02:14:42.766 --> 02:14:47.145
Dummy Hoy is chasing it down,
but I think it's too far gone.

02:14:47.228 --> 02:14:50.482
Dummy is still chasing it down.

02:14:50.565 --> 02:14:51.816
The crowd is clearing out of his way.

02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:55.654
He caught it! He caught it!
I don't believe it!

02:14:55.737 --> 02:14:58.823
Dummy Hoy jumped over the
horse and caught the ball

02:14:58.907 --> 02:15:01.326
to help Oshkosh win the pennant!

02:15:01.409 --> 02:15:02.661
I don't believe it!

02:15:02.744 --> 02:15:05.330
This is the gutsiest

02:15:05.413 --> 02:15:06.831
player I've ever seen!

02:15:06.915 --> 02:15:08.333
No, he cannot
jump

02:15:08.416 --> 02:15:09.584
on a horse and buggy like that!

02:15:09.668 --> 02:15:10.669
Ump! Ump!
He can't do that!

02:15:10.752 --> 02:15:11.920
That's not
legal!

02:15:12.003 --> 02:15:12.962
Doubleday would
have your hide!

02:15:13.046 --> 02:15:14.005
He can't do that!
That's not fair!

02:15:14.089 --> 02:15:15.048
That's not an
out!

02:15:15.131 --> 02:15:16.091
That's a home
run!

02:15:16.174 --> 02:15:17.175
- run!
- That's a home

02:15:17.258 --> 02:15:19.010
Yes!

02:15:19.094 --> 02:15:20.303
Pa!
Pa!

02:15:20.387 --> 02:15:23.014
This telegram just came in!
It's from William!

02:15:23.098 --> 02:15:26.351
From William?

02:15:26.434 --> 02:15:29.020
Dear Ma and Pa, we
just won...

02:15:30.271 --> 02:15:33.858
we just won the pennant here in
Oshkosh,

02:15:33.942 --> 02:15:37.529
and the Washington Nationals
just signed me.

02:15:37.612 --> 02:15:39.864
Thank you for believing in me.

02:15:39.948 --> 02:15:41.908
Your son, William Hoy.

02:15:41.992 --> 02:15:42.826
- That's our boy!
- We're all proud of

02:15:42.909 --> 02:15:43.743
him, Jacob.

02:15:43.827 --> 02:15:46.037
Mighty proud.
Mighty proud.

02:15:46.121 --> 02:15:50.417
That's our boy!

02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:52.127
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:53.712
here today to throw out the first pitch

02:15:53.795 --> 02:15:55.755
is a man who helped change

02:15:55.839 --> 02:15:57.215
the way baseball is played today.

02:15:57.298 --> 02:16:00.051
The first deaf major league
star.

02:16:00.135 --> 02:16:03.722
Will you please welcome the
amazing

02:16:03.805 --> 02:16:05.932
William "Dummy" Hoy.
