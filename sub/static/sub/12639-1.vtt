Captioning Made Possible By
Disney Abc Cable Networks Group

00:09.909 --> 00:11.910
Quintuplets.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.881
Pretty Cool, Huh?

00:17.083 --> 00:21.553
In A Word...
That's A Lot Of Babies.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.957
The Grover Family?

00:24.991 --> 00:26.325
Wow.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.360
I'm Jamie Grover,

00:28.395 --> 00:29.661
Part Of The Grover Family.

00:29.696 --> 00:33.165
What A Weird Coincidence.

00:35.835 --> 00:38.937
Ok, So It's Not A Coincidence.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.573
You See, This Is My Story.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.409
And, Yeah,
It's One Of Those

00:43.443 --> 00:47.413
Girl Finds Herself Even Though She
Didn't Know She Was Lost Stories.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.748
But I Promise You,
It's Not Gonna Be Lame,

00:49.783 --> 00:53.419
And It's Not
Gonna Be Boring. Ok?

00:54.721 --> 00:56.121
Oh, And For The Record,

00:56.156 --> 00:58.123
I'm Not One Of The Quints.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.758
I'm Their Older Sister.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.860
And To Really Understand
My Story,

01:01.895 --> 01:04.530
We Need To Go Back
To Last January,

01:04.563 --> 01:06.732
Before My Brothers
And Sisters Arrived.

01:06.766 --> 01:08.567
Sound Good?

01:08.601 --> 01:09.802
Great.

01:09.836 --> 01:13.072
You Know, We're Gonna
Get Along Just Fine.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.340
That's My Dad,
Jim Grover.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.576
And No, He's Not Doing
My Homework.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.911
He's Doing His Own.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.245
Dad's Taking Classes.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.048
A College Degree Leads
To One More Promotion,

01:23.083 --> 01:24.817
At Least In Dad's
Big Plan.

01:24.851 --> 01:27.886
See, Dad Believes You Should
Always Try To Improve Yourself,

01:27.954 --> 01:29.888
Never Rest
On What You've Got.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.424
Unfortunately...
He's A Lousy Student.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.159
Still, A Plan Is A Plan,

01:34.194 --> 01:37.229
And Yes, Dad Always
Has A Plan.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.865
Oh, And That's Mom,
Nancy Grover.

01:39.899 --> 01:41.800
She Publishes
A Little Town Paper,

01:41.835 --> 01:43.802
And, Well, There's No Nice
Way To Say This,

01:43.837 --> 01:46.271
But She's A Tiny Bit
Scatterbrained.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.740
But Still, We're Used To It.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.708
Morning.

01:49.742 --> 01:50.742
Morning.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.010
Ah, We Meet Again.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.113
Oh, Did You See
The Fridge, By The Way?

01:54.147 --> 01:55.981
Shrine To Me.

01:56.015 --> 01:57.850
Anyway, I Remember This Day.

01:57.884 --> 02:01.353
And You Don't Need To See What
Happened Next To Understand My Story,

02:01.421 --> 02:03.722
So Let's Just Move On, Ok?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.025
Now, Please. Now.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.262
Fine. Let's Just
Show You Where I Live.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.669
That's More Like It.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.538
This Is My House.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.508
And It Looks Like 90 %
Of The Houses Here In Milford.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.710
Oh, And For Those Of You
Who Aren't So Quick,

02:24.744 --> 02:26.478
Milford Is My Home Town.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.747
So Let's Take A Peek At It,
Shall We?

02:28.781 --> 02:30.249
Here We Go.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.885
That's Downtown.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.820
You Got Your Bank,
Grocery Store,

02:34.854 --> 02:36.421
A Couple Of Restaurants,

02:36.456 --> 02:37.856
And The Ice-Cream Parlor.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.726
But The One Thing
That Makes Milford Famous

02:40.760 --> 02:43.896
Is Just A Block
To The East.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.665
Ok, So That's
Not Really There.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.934
Just Making Sure
You're With Me.

02:48.968 --> 02:50.335
Next Stop...

02:50.370 --> 02:53.005
Yep. School.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.941
But Don't Worry.
This Isn't One Of Those Scary Stories.

02:55.975 --> 02:57.643
See? High School Is Great.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.746
Now Come On Inside With Me And
My Best Friends Zoe And Brad.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.981
Come On!

03:08.721 --> 03:11.657
My School Is Pretty Much
The Same As Most Schools.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.393
Every Day Is Like
Going To The Circus.

03:14.427 --> 03:17.229
Oh, There Goes
My Math Teacher.

03:17.263 --> 03:21.266
I'm Telling You,
This Place Is Really Great.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.301
Ok.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.569
I Lied.

03:28.408 --> 03:31.443
Hey, I Can Dream,
Can't I?

03:31.477 --> 03:33.779
Anyway... The Truth Is,

03:33.813 --> 03:35.881
My School's
Like Any Other School.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.750
There Are No Circus Clowns
Or Acrobats Or--

03:38.785 --> 03:40.752
Ooh, Hi, Jessica--

03:40.787 --> 03:43.722
Or No--Ah, Eech--

03:43.756 --> 03:45.224
Fire-Breathers.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.559
Well, Unless You Count
The Gym Teacher, Mr. Brooks,

03:47.594 --> 03:49.561
But That's
A Different Story.

03:49.596 --> 03:53.398
Anyway, The Point Is,
I Have To Show You My School

03:53.466 --> 03:57.069
Because I Have To Show You
Who I Was Back Then. Ok?

03:57.103 --> 03:59.438
Here We Go.

03:59.472 --> 04:01.840
We Want As!

04:01.874 --> 04:04.243
Ha Ha. Not Bad.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.678
One B-Plus
And 2 A-Minuses.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.013
I Hate You.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.215
Maybe You Should Take
My Card, Jamie.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.817
It's All As.

04:11.851 --> 04:14.152
That's Sweet,
But I Don't Believe You'd Fool Her Parents.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.488
You Know The Name Thing,
Male Versus Female? Not Gonna Work.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.623
Good Point.

04:17.656 --> 04:20.192
Hey, Mr. Blackmer, Ready
For Art Club Tomorrow?

04:20.226 --> 04:24.029
Indeed. And I Have Been
Supremely Busy

04:24.063 --> 04:25.864
Whipping Up A 4-Course
Italian Meal

04:25.898 --> 04:27.599
To Go With The Slides
I'll Be Showing

04:27.634 --> 04:29.401
Of The Italian Masters'
Paintings.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.736
Say, Why Don't
You Two Join Us?

04:30.770 --> 04:32.871
Ahh. No Can Do.

04:32.905 --> 04:34.806
I Gotta Work On
My Science Fair Project.

04:34.841 --> 04:37.676
Ahh, Young DA Vinci,
Huh?

04:37.710 --> 04:39.711
Look, Everyone Has Something That They Love, Right?

04:39.746 --> 04:42.514
And Science
Is Your Thing.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.217
Anyway, Best Of Luck,
Jamie, Brad.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.919
Oh, And, Zoe,
I Will See You Tomorrow, Huh?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.888
Come Hungry.

04:50.923 --> 04:52.724
Don't Be A Dragola,
Jamie.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.426
Science
Isn't Your Thing!

04:54.460 --> 04:55.627
Come To Art Club!

04:55.662 --> 04:57.729
Like I Have Time, Z.

04:57.764 --> 05:00.799
We Grovers Have Turned
This Into Contest Year.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.335
Contests Are My Thing.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.772
Anyway, It's Off To The Man With The Plan.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.508
Let Me Tell You Something.
This Card--Eech--

05:09.542 --> 05:11.209
Is Not Part
Of The Plan.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.544
See You Later.

05:12.578 --> 05:13.612
See You.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.214
The Plan,
In Case You Were Wondering,

05:16.249 --> 05:18.216
Was For Me, Jamie Grover,

05:18.251 --> 05:20.185
To Attend G.W. Next Fall.

05:20.219 --> 05:23.722
G.W... Also Known
As George Washington

05:23.756 --> 05:25.223
Science Magnet School.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.359
Starting To See
The Picture?

05:27.393 --> 05:29.561
I Felt Pressure
From My Folks,

05:29.595 --> 05:30.996
Pressure From Myself,

05:31.030 --> 05:32.631
Even Pressure
From The Dog.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.234
Ok, We Don't Have A Dog,
But I Think You Get The Point.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.669
The Bottom Line--

05:37.704 --> 05:40.572
I'm An Only Child Who Hates
To Let Her Parents Down,

05:40.606 --> 05:43.075
And That's Exactly
What I Was Doing.

05:46.312 --> 05:47.412
Oh, Hey, Dad.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.481
Oh, Hey, Honey.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.516
Ah...

05:51.551 --> 05:55.687
Ok, My Beauty,
Here We Go.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.027
Well... Ha.
The Important Thing Is That You're Trying.

06:02.061 --> 06:02.994
Yeah.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.463
Come Into My Office
A Sec.

06:04.497 --> 06:05.831
Ok.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.301
I Like What You've
Done With The Place.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.969
Yes, Thank You.
I Like To Call This Style

06:11.003 --> 06:13.205
Everything But
The Kitchen Sink.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.840
Kitchen Sinks
Are In Aisle 12.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.508
Aw, Honey, Once
I Get My Degree,

06:16.542 --> 06:18.143
I'm Gonna Have
A Much Better Office.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.512
Don't Worry.
I'm Gonna Get Into College.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.280
Yes, I Know.
Yes, You Are.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.015
You're Gonna Be The First Grover To Do So.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.418
But, You Know,
You Gotta Start With These Baby Steps.

06:26.452 --> 06:27.719
90 % Of The Kids

06:27.754 --> 06:30.389
Who Go To George Washington
Science Magnet Go On To College!

06:30.423 --> 06:31.923
It's A Lot More
Than At Your School.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.025
I'm Working On It.
I Know The Plan.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.595
Ok, Ok. I Know
You Know The Plan.

06:36.629 --> 06:37.796
You're Very Smart.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.031
Back In Those Days,
This Was My Life.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.300
Only Child.
Do What The Folks Ask.

06:42.335 --> 06:46.071
At Least Visiting Mom Was A Whole
Different Experience Than Seeing Dad.

06:46.105 --> 06:47.739
Better Or Worse...

06:47.774 --> 06:49.875
You Be The Judge.

06:52.311 --> 06:53.912
Oh! Oh,
But Mr. Ziff,

06:53.946 --> 06:55.213
You've Just Got
To Meet With Her.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.048
She's Industrious,
Clever, And Very Bright.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.584
Trying To Get You
An Internship.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.820
Oh! Ok!

07:01.854 --> 07:03.455
Well, Please
Think About It.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.123
And Thank You
For The Interview.

07:05.158 --> 07:09.161
You'll Be The Cover Story Of
The Next "Milford Weekly."

07:11.063 --> 07:12.998
So I Guess You're
Feeling Better.

07:13.032 --> 07:14.966
I'm Feeling Great.
And I Almost Got You A Meeting

07:15.001 --> 07:18.370
With Mr. Raymond Ziff,
The Owner Of The Ziff Chain Of Department Stores

07:18.404 --> 07:20.005
And A Very Prominent Lawyer.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.640
Oh, Yeah, That's What
I'm Gonna Be--

07:21.674 --> 07:23.375
A Lawyer And A Department Store Owner.

07:23.409 --> 07:26.211
Don't Sell Yourself Short,
Jamie.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.647
You Can Be Anything.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.716
If My Parents Had Told Me That,
Who Knows?

07:31.751 --> 07:33.552
I Might Be Running
"The New York Times" Now

07:33.586 --> 07:35.153
Instead Of
"The Milford Weekly."

07:43.729 --> 07:47.032
I Know You're Gonna
Get Into Magnet Somehow.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.503
Did You Bring Me The Poem
From Your English Class Yet?

07:51.537 --> 07:52.904
Oh, No, Not That.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.973
Yes. I Want To Publish It.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.575
Right...

07:56.609 --> 07:57.709
Right...

07:57.743 --> 07:59.211
Mom Treated
"The Milford Weekly"

07:59.245 --> 08:01.012
Like One Of Those Family
Christmas Letters

08:01.047 --> 08:02.848
Where Parents Bragged About
Their Kids And Stuff.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.816
"Grover's Corner."

08:04.851 --> 08:06.151
The Only Difference Is,

08:06.185 --> 08:08.854
Mom Got People
To Pay For The Ads.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.989
Everyone Loves To Read
Your Stuff, Jamie.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.657
They Know
How Special You Are.

08:12.692 --> 08:15.727
People Ask Me All The Time,
"Is She Gonna Be A Lawyer,

08:15.761 --> 08:17.696
A Doctor,
Or Even A News Anchor?"

08:17.730 --> 08:19.831
Maybe We're Not Doing
Enough To Help You.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.534
We Want To Give You Every
Opportunity To Succeed, Honey.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.035
College And Beyond--

08:24.070 --> 08:25.470
What A Great Future You Have Ahead Of You.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.240
And We Can't Wait To Watch.
Mm-Hmm!

08:28.274 --> 08:35.013
Aah!

08:36.249 --> 08:38.015
You Can
Quote Me, Brad.

08:38.049 --> 08:41.253
Anyway, I Hope
You're Having Fun

08:41.287 --> 08:43.188
Doing Whatever You're Doing.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.758
I'm Here... Working.
Ha Ha. Bye.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.862
Eech.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.865
Anyway,
Don't Get Me Wrong.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.901
I Know This Is
Kind Of Weird,

08:55.935 --> 08:57.702
But I Loved My Parents.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.704
And They Really Wanted
What Was Best For Me,

08:59.739 --> 09:01.506
And That's Great, Ok?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.342
Now, I Already Told You
That I Was Lost

09:04.377 --> 09:05.744
But I Didn't Know It.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.812
I Did Know Something
Was Wrong, Though,

09:07.847 --> 09:10.515
But I Thought Maybe It Was
Just My Science Fair Project.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.285
Hey, Kiddo.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.286
Hey, Dad.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.554
So How's It Goin'?

09:15.588 --> 09:17.188
Pretty Good.
Pretty Good.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.456
Need Any Help?

09:18.491 --> 09:20.091
Uh, No.
That's Ok.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.826
All Right.
That's Probably For The Best.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.662
The Truth Is,
I Really Wouldn't Be Much Help

09:23.696 --> 09:25.630
With This Science
Stuff. Woof.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.500
You Know,
I Was Only Good At One Thing In High School.

09:28.534 --> 09:29.668
What Was That?

09:29.702 --> 09:32.671
Photography.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.307
No, Wait. How Come When You Take
Those Pictures Of Me And Mom,

09:35.341 --> 09:37.442
We're Usually, Like,
Way Out Of Focus?

09:37.476 --> 09:39.244
Because I Had To Give It Up A Long Time Ago.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.513
You Know, Art And Music,
Photography Just Weren't

09:41.547 --> 09:42.514
Part Of The Plan.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.986
Well, I Think It Looks Like A Winner.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.689
I Think It's Gonna Be The First Of Many,
Many Blue Ribbons.

09:50.723 --> 09:51.856
Right?

09:51.891 --> 09:54.092
Yeah. Well,
We'll Know Friday Night.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.828
Yeah, We Will.
You'll Make Us Proud, Honey.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.029
You Always Do.
All Right, Honey.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.397
Call Me If You Need
Anything Else.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.932
Okey-Dokey.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.335
Who Were We Kidding?
Me Win The Blue Ribbon?

10:03.369 --> 10:06.204
Although I Gotta Say,
I Was Pretty Proud Of My Project.

10:06.238 --> 10:09.374
Man, OVER P.A.:
And The Winner Is... Jamie Grover

10:09.408 --> 10:12.644
For Revolutionizing Modern
Physics In Her Free Time!

10:15.815 --> 10:17.716
Oh, Get Real.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.250
And The Winner Is...

10:19.285 --> 10:23.555
Bradley Brown For His
Electromagnetic Power Project.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.558
Great Job, You Stupid
Genius, You.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.293
Hey, I Think Jamie's
Project's Great, Too.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.562
I Could Have Never Gotten
That To Work.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.063
Hey, Everybody!

10:32.098 --> 10:33.798
Hey, Honey.
I'm Very Proud Of You.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.300
Hi, Zoe.

10:35.334 --> 10:36.401
Bradley,
Congratulations Again.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.637
I'm Sure Your Parents
Will Be Very Proud.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.105
Relieved, Really.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.339
But It's Something.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.274
Well, We'll See You
At Home.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.110
Oh, And I Found A Great Essay
Contest For You To Enter.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.912
I'll Tell Ya All About It.
Good Job.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.914
All Right,
See You Guys.

10:49.949 --> 10:50.982
Bye.
Bye-Bye.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.451
And The Plan
Continues.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.452
You Know,

10:54.487 --> 10:55.453
Sometimes
My Parents--

10:55.488 --> 10:56.688
Your Parents
Love You.

10:56.722 --> 11:00.659
I Know That.
But I Wish I Could Just Have A Few Days

11:00.693 --> 11:02.894
Where I Wasn't The Center Of Their Lives.

11:02.928 --> 11:05.430
I Can't Give Them
What They Want.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.465
I Want To,
But I Just Can't.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.869
Here's Another Little
Rule Of Thumb For You.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.705
Be Careful
What You Wish For.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.674
What Are We
Gonna Tell Jamie?

11:17.743 --> 11:19.911
What Will You
Tell Me About What?

11:19.945 --> 11:20.912
We Were, Um...

11:20.946 --> 11:25.216
What I Meant Was, Um...

11:25.251 --> 11:28.720
Your Father Has
Something To Say.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.657
Honey...

11:32.692 --> 11:35.060
So, Jamie, Your Mom...

11:36.128 --> 11:38.930
Is, Um, Pregnant.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.233
That's Great, Mom!

11:42.268 --> 11:43.401
Yeah.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.070
That Wasn't So Hard.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.072
No, I Guess,

11:47.106 --> 11:52.110
But I Don't Understand
How This Could Happen.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.779
Well, Mom,
As I Remember,

11:54.814 --> 11:56.648
You Said
That When 2 People

11:56.682 --> 11:58.349
Fall So Madly In Love
With Each Other That--

11:58.384 --> 12:02.187
No, That's Not
What I Meant.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.356
Jamie...

12:05.391 --> 12:07.559
I'm...

12:07.593 --> 12:09.394
Really--

12:09.428 --> 12:12.731
Really, Really,

12:12.765 --> 12:16.568
Really, Really...

12:16.602 --> 12:17.969
Really Pregnant.

The Moment I Heard
Mom Was Pregnant,

13:11.390 --> 13:13.224
I Knew My Life
Was Gonna Change--

13:13.259 --> 13:14.526
No More Only Child

13:14.560 --> 13:16.361
And No More
Nonstop Attention.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.229
My Greatest Wish
Had Been Granted

13:18.264 --> 13:19.964
In The Most Unexpected Way.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.900
Those Kids
Were Gonna Save Me.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.635
Ok, Sure,

13:23.669 --> 13:26.538
So It Takes Months And Months For Babies To Arrive,

13:26.572 --> 13:29.040
And During That Time,
Nothing Really Changed.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.409
Well, Except
For Mom's Belly.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.244
Brad Was Still A Genius,

13:33.279 --> 13:35.013
Zoe Was Completely Happy,

13:35.047 --> 13:36.714
And The School,
Unfortunately,

13:36.749 --> 13:38.583
Kept Giving Out
Report Cards.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.351
But I Knew, I Really Knew

13:40.386 --> 13:41.619
That Things Would Be
Different Soon.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.421
You Knew It Too,
Didn't You?

13:43.455 --> 13:45.390
Good.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.760
Ooh! Ooh!

13:48.794 --> 13:51.596
Oh, Ooh.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.233
Ooh. Ooh!

13:55.267 --> 13:56.734
Hey, Mom,
I Got My Report--

13:56.769 --> 13:58.336
Shh! Contraction!

13:58.370 --> 14:00.171
Hey, Dad,
I Got Another Report--

14:00.206 --> 14:01.873
Yeah. Here.
Hold This.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.174
Babies Coming.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.076
Ok, Ok, Honey.
Breathe. Breathe.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.846
Oh, This Is So Exciting.

14:07.880 --> 14:08.880
Ok, Honey,
You Know What?

14:08.914 --> 14:10.448
I Got--
I Got Your Clothes,

14:10.482 --> 14:11.783
And Some Other Clothes
Just In Case,

14:11.817 --> 14:13.117
And Then I Got
That Videotape

14:13.152 --> 14:14.519
And All The Magazines
You Wanted.

14:14.553 --> 14:15.987
Oh, Honey,
You're So Beautiful.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.188
Shoes! Shoes! Shoes!

14:17.223 --> 14:18.823
Shoes!
I Got To Get Shoes!

14:18.858 --> 14:20.358
Ok. No, No, Get The Right Shoes.
Get The Right Shoes.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.527
Of Course,
Get The Right Shoes.

14:22.561 --> 14:25.063
To The Car?
Mm-Hmm.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.030
It Doesn't Matter.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.031
Ok.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.200
Ok.
Ok. I Got You.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.668
Come On,
Come On.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.870
Ok.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.205
Was He This Crazy
When I Was Born?

14:34.240 --> 14:36.207
No, He Was Calm
As A Cucumber,

14:36.242 --> 14:37.675
Although He Did
Forget My Shoes.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.577
Shoes! Shoes! Shoes!
Gotta Get Shoes!

14:39.612 --> 14:41.679
Shoes! Get The Shoes!
Whoa!

14:41.714 --> 14:42.914
Honey, You Better
Go Check On Him.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.183
Aah! And Hurry.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.584
Ok. Ok.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.886
Dad!

14:47.920 --> 14:49.888
Dad! Dad,
Where Are You?

14:49.922 --> 14:51.556
Shoes! Shoes!
Got The Shoes!

14:51.590 --> 14:52.757
Got The Shoes.
We're Fine.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.559
We're Gonna Be Fine.
Gonna Be Fine.

14:54.593 --> 14:57.195
Got The Shoes.
Come On. Come On.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.399
Dad! Wait!

15:01.433 --> 15:03.601
Don't Forget
About Me! Dad!

15:03.636 --> 15:04.702
Dad! Dad!

15:06.405 --> 15:07.705
Honey, I'm So Sorry.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.740
Thanks, Dad.

15:08.774 --> 15:09.874
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.478
It's A Boy!

15:13.512 --> 15:15.780
Adam!

15:15.814 --> 15:17.482
Yes!

15:18.417 --> 15:19.617
It's A Boy!

15:24.590 --> 15:26.491
Becky!

15:26.525 --> 15:29.193
It's A Girl!

15:29.228 --> 15:30.862
It's A Girl!

15:34.099 --> 15:35.366
Charlie!

15:35.401 --> 15:36.734
This One's Name
Is Charlie.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.735
Thanks.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.938
Debbie.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.473
To Debbie!

15:44.043 --> 15:45.243
To Debbie!
To Debbie! To Debbie!

15:45.277 --> 15:46.844
Eddie.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.746
Eddie!
Eddie! Eddie!

15:48.781 --> 15:50.782
Wow.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.750
Eddie?

15:56.989 --> 15:59.290
You're Gonna Need This.

15:59.325 --> 16:01.826
Thanks.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.195
I Think You're Gonna
Need These More.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.196
Thanks.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.065
Oh, This Is So Amazing.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.199
No, It's More
Than Amazing.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.001
It's, Um, Uh...

16:10.035 --> 16:12.403
I Don't Know,
It's, Um...

16:12.438 --> 16:15.139
It's Quints.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.075
Yeah...

16:17.109 --> 16:19.477
It's Quints.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.079
My Brothers And Sisters

16:21.113 --> 16:23.381
Were The First Ever
Quintuplets In Our State.

16:23.415 --> 16:24.682
They Were Famous.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.152
When We Got Home, There Was
A Crowd Waiting For Us.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.354
Well, Waiting For Them,

16:29.388 --> 16:31.489
But It Was Still
Kinda Cool.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.358
Let's Go Up And See If We Can
Get A Word With The Parents.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.059
There They Are,
The Grovers.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.694
Oh, Hi.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.229
Excuse Me,
Mrs. Grover?

16:38.263 --> 16:39.564
Nancy, Jim!

16:39.598 --> 16:41.366
Nancy,
Can We Get A Shot?

16:41.400 --> 16:44.202
Me And My Family Started
Our New Life Together.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.037
Yeah, New Life.

16:46.071 --> 16:47.872
'Cause Let Me
Tell You Something,

16:47.906 --> 16:50.441
When You Have 5 Babies
To Take Care Of,

16:50.476 --> 16:52.343
Reality Sets In Fast.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.326
Hey, Not Bad.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.896
Totally Bogus,
But Not Bad.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.505
Welcome Home.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.540
Ha! And This Is The New Life
I've Been Waiting For?

17:23.575 --> 17:24.876
Say It With Me This Time.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.211
Ha!

17:27.246 --> 17:28.546
Ok.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.548
Ok, Next, Please.

17:30.582 --> 17:31.883
Names. Use Names.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.017
Next Please, Jamie.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.285
No, Baby Names.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.721
Oh, Baby Names: Adam, Becky, Charlie, Debbie, Eddie.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.189
No, Dad, One At A Time.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.024
Please, Just
Give Me A Baby.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.526
Ok, Now Listen,
According To This,

17:41.560 --> 17:44.195
They're Either Hungry Or Wet
Or Tired Or In Pain.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.897
We Simply Just Have
To Check Off Which One.

17:45.931 --> 17:47.532
Not Enough Time.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.269
Shhhhh.

17:51.303 --> 17:52.670
Make Them Stop!

17:52.704 --> 17:54.138
They Need Changing.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.441
I Don't Care.
Just Make Them Stop, Please.

17:56.475 --> 17:57.542
We Need More Diapers.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.776
No, Honey,
That's Not Possible.

17:58.811 --> 17:59.777
According To The Baby Plan,

17:59.812 --> 18:00.878
We Have 3 Dozen Left.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.146
That Was A Few
Hours Ago, Honey.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.549
No, But We Have
3 Dozen Left.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.552
Dad! Past Tense.
We Had 3 Dozen.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.586
But I-- Just Go To The Store!

18:08.620 --> 18:09.687
Go To The Store.

18:09.721 --> 18:11.389
I'll Go. I'll Go.
You Don't Drive.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.890
I Don't Care.
I'll Run, Then.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.459
No, No, No,
That Doesn't Make Any Sense.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.827
No, No, No, Honey,
I'll Go To The Store.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.161
Why? Because I Drive.
You Don't Drive.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.329
You Stay Here.
I'm Gonna Get Diapers.

18:18.363 --> 18:19.864
Dad, Dad, Earplugs,
Please.

18:19.898 --> 18:20.832
Yes, Yes, Of Course.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.266
And Honey,
While You're Out?

18:22.301 --> 18:24.602
Get Us Help.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.838
Right, Help.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.021
Enjoy THE SILENCE.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.357
It MIGHT NEVER
COME AGAIN.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.694
2 a.m.?
2 a.m.?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.534
No, NO, NO.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.818
Good NIGHT.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.655
Yup, I've Got
To Admit It.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.090
You Couldn't Help
But Love Them,

19:19.124 --> 19:22.326
But Remember,
This Is My Story, Not Theirs,

19:22.361 --> 19:24.662
And Here On The First Day
Of My New Life,

19:24.696 --> 19:27.832
The Only Thing I Really
Felt Was Exhaustion,

19:27.866 --> 19:30.768
So I Went To Bed
And Slept For Hours.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.674
Ok, Less Than An Hour.

19:36.708 --> 19:40.378
Man, Those Little Lungs
Sure Worked Well,

19:40.412 --> 19:41.846
And I've Got To Tell You,

19:41.880 --> 19:44.682
At First, School Didn't Seem
Any Different, Either.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.351
I Wasn't Loving
My New Life At All.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.520
So, Do You
Feel Different?

19:49.555 --> 19:52.523
I Feel Like
Drinking Coffee.

19:52.558 --> 19:56.027
Ok, Fine, But After
The Baby Nurse Starts Today,

19:56.061 --> 19:58.896
Why Is Your Life
Gonna Be So Much Better?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.164
I Don't Know.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.534
Well, Maybe Without My Parents
Watching My Every Move,

20:03.569 --> 20:05.736
I Can Get Into Magnet--
You Know,

20:05.771 --> 20:07.238
Work My Own Way In.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.673
That's It?!

20:08.707 --> 20:12.043
Don't Get Me Wrong,
I Want You To Join Me At G.W.,

20:12.077 --> 20:13.844
But That's What You
Really Want To Do

20:13.879 --> 20:15.079
With Your New Freedom?

20:15.113 --> 20:18.216
Yeah. Isn't It?

20:20.619 --> 20:22.019
Yo, Mr. B!

20:23.622 --> 20:24.889
What Should Jamie Do

20:24.923 --> 20:27.325
Now That She Has
5 Brothers And Sisters?

20:27.359 --> 20:29.727
Uh, Learn To Make
Pancakes?

20:29.761 --> 20:31.495
No, No, I Mean
In Her Life,

20:31.530 --> 20:33.197
You Know, Here, School.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.198
Oh, Well That's Easy.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.067
Join Art Club.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.969
Why?

20:38.003 --> 20:39.770
Well, Sometimes
I Work Hypothetically,

20:39.805 --> 20:41.939
And I Think,
Hypothetically,

20:41.974 --> 20:43.808
That You Might Like
Art Club.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.576
Sometimes I Work
Alphabetically,

20:45.611 --> 20:47.645
And Art Starts
With An "A."

20:47.679 --> 20:49.280
But I'm Not Good
In Your Class,

20:49.314 --> 20:50.615
So Why Join Art Club?

20:50.649 --> 20:52.483
My Heart
Just Isn't Into Art,

20:52.517 --> 20:54.318
You Said So Yourself.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.354
Where Is Your Heart,
Jamie?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.461
Ah, Well, When You Can
Answer That Question,

21:03.495 --> 21:04.695
Then You'll Know
Exactly What To Do,

21:04.730 --> 21:07.531
But In The Meantime,
Art Club Could Be Fun,

21:07.566 --> 21:09.700
And The Best Thing Is
No Grades.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.036
That Is The Best Thing.

21:12.070 --> 21:15.406
Plus I Hear The Guy
Who Runs It Is Pretty Cool.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.776
Hey. Here.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.779
Later At Home,
I Saw Changes.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.281
The Pressure
Was Finally Off Me.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.017
So What Do You Think,
Jim, Lawyer

21:26.051 --> 21:27.585
Or Computer Programmer?

21:27.619 --> 21:29.787
Both.

21:29.821 --> 21:32.590
Oh, Wow. Any Careers
Left For Me?

21:32.624 --> 21:34.659
Oh, Sweetie,
You Shouldn't Worry About It.

21:34.693 --> 21:35.960
Your New Brothers
And Sisters

21:35.994 --> 21:37.261
Are Gonna Take Care
Of Everything.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.230
Forget About School,
Jamie.

21:39.264 --> 21:42.099
Your Only Job Now
Is To Have Fun.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.768
Are You Buying This?

21:43.802 --> 21:45.102
Anyone?

21:45.137 --> 21:48.606
If You Did,
You Have To Stay Late And Clean The Blackboard.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.742
Still, A Few Moments
After Getting Home,

21:51.777 --> 21:53.210
Something Pointed Me
On My Path

21:53.245 --> 21:54.845
Towards My Real Problem,

21:54.880 --> 21:57.481
Though It Sure Didn't
Seem That Way At First.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.152
It's Ok. Shh. Shh.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.454
Shh. Shh.
Hey, Mom.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.523
Oh, I Am So Happy
You're Here.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.692
Uh, Zoe, Have You Ever
Changed A Baby's Diaper?

22:07.726 --> 22:08.893
Uh, Do Dolls Count?

22:08.927 --> 22:11.362
Ok, Maybe We Ought
To Start You With A Girl.

22:11.396 --> 22:14.365
Boys Tend To Pee On You.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.167
Eww.

22:17.235 --> 22:20.037
Oh, Oh, I Hope
That's The Baby Nurse.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.806
If I Don't
Get Some Sleep Soon,

22:21.840 --> 22:24.175
I--I--I Don't Know
What I'll Do.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.377
Well, Won't It Be
Kinda Weird,

22:26.411 --> 22:28.579
You Know, Having Somebody
In The House All The Time?

22:34.753 --> 22:36.587
Trust Me, Honey.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.689
We Won't Even Notice
She's Here.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.758
♪ I Come To You
From Overseas ♪

22:40.792 --> 22:43.761
♪ Babies, Babies,
And We'll Be Friends-- ♪

22:43.795 --> 22:45.429
Oh, You Look Terrible.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.831
You Must Be The Mother.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.399
Well, Then, Have A Rest.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.935
There You Go. Sit Down.
Go On. Have A Seat.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.270
There, I'll
Take Control Now.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.840
I'm Gonna Take Care
Of Everything For You.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.308
Don't You Worry, Now.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.744
Now, I See 1, 2, 3,

22:59.778 --> 23:01.679
4, 5, 6, And 7.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.646
Who Might You Be?

23:02.681 --> 23:03.814
I'm Jamie,
And That's Zoe.

23:03.849 --> 23:06.016
Well It's A Pleasure.
I'm Fiona,

23:06.051 --> 23:08.185
And This Is My Room,
So Farewell.

23:08.220 --> 23:11.589
Only The Immediate Family
Is Allowed Around Here.

23:11.623 --> 23:12.823
Whatever.

23:12.858 --> 23:15.126
But I'm
Their Older Sister.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.262
Oh, My Apologies,
Older Sister.

23:18.296 --> 23:19.397
You, We'll
Be Seeing You.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.098
There We Go.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.867
Bye, Grovers.
Good Day!

23:22.901 --> 23:24.101
Good Day.

23:24.136 --> 23:27.238
Whoo, 5 Babies.

23:27.272 --> 23:28.439
We Have Our Work.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.709
Join Me, Number 6.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.943
My Name Is Jamie.

23:32.978 --> 23:34.678
Good. You'll Be
Helping Me.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.981
Chop-Chop.

23:37.015 --> 23:38.716
Over There.

23:43.488 --> 23:44.889
Soon I Could
Change A Diaper

23:44.923 --> 23:46.824
In 7 Seconds Flat.

23:46.858 --> 23:48.259
That Probably Wouldn't
Get Me Into Magnet,

23:48.293 --> 23:50.327
But It Was
Kind Of Impressive.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.463
Fiona Was Impressive, Too.

23:52.497 --> 23:55.199
I Knew Right Away That Dad
Would Love Fiona's Methods.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.501
Yup, Fiona Had A Plan, Too.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.336
Number 1
Has Done Number 2...

23:59.371 --> 24:01.705
At 3 p.m.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.141
Oh! 1, 2, 3.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.544
That's So Amusing.

24:06.578 --> 24:07.978
Heh. I'm Laughing,
Really.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.147
Ok, So Adam's
Done Number 2.

24:10.182 --> 24:13.017
I'll Mark Down Number 2.
I'll List It.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.886
I Will Synchronize
These Quints.

24:15.921 --> 24:19.056
Like Clockwork,
They Shall Pee And Poop

24:19.090 --> 24:21.792
And Eat And Sleep.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.194
But You Can't
Control Them.

24:23.228 --> 24:24.261
They're Babies.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.131
Ah, But I Am Fiona.

24:29.267 --> 24:30.367
After This Day,

24:30.402 --> 24:32.203
I Didn't Want
To Hurry Home To Help Fiona,

24:32.237 --> 24:34.705
So I Found Ways
To Stay Later At School.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.641
That's The First Odd Way
Fiona Helped Me.

24:39.110 --> 24:42.413
Sure, I Was Petrified My Folks
Would Ask What I Was Up To,

24:42.447 --> 24:44.081
But I Took The Chance.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.683
I Joined Art Club.

24:45.717 --> 24:48.385
And, Heck,
I Could Always Rely On The Classic Excuse,

24:48.420 --> 24:50.387
The Baby Nurse
Made Me Do It.

24:50.422 --> 24:53.057
Come On, Grab A Paintbrush,
Clay, Anything.

24:53.091 --> 24:55.092
I'm Only Here
'Cause You're Here, Z.

24:55.126 --> 24:56.393
I Don't Know What To Do.

24:56.428 --> 24:58.729
The Motto Of Art Club
Is This:

24:58.763 --> 25:00.498
When You
Don't Know What To Do,

25:00.532 --> 25:02.132
Do Something You
Don't Know How To Do.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.368
Wait, Translation,
Please?

25:04.402 --> 25:05.903
Have You Ever

25:05.937 --> 25:08.038
Closed Your Eyes
And Imagined?

25:08.073 --> 25:09.440
Imagined What?

25:09.474 --> 25:10.808
Exactly.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.977
So Close Those Eyes

25:13.011 --> 25:15.746
And Then Draw
What You See.

25:18.783 --> 25:21.085
Try It. It Won't Hurt.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.461
So I Started Drawing.

25:30.495 --> 25:33.097
It Wasn't Getting Me
Into Science Magnet, I Know,

25:33.131 --> 25:34.698
But It Was Better
Than Being Home.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.433
Home Was Just Weird.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.836
Now, Number 3
Wakes Every 2 Hours,

25:38.870 --> 25:40.971
And Number 5 Eats
Every 4.2 Hours.

25:41.006 --> 25:43.574
Here's Another
Life Lesson For You.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.743
Mary Poppins Is A Myth.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.578
Uh-Huh.
They Must Be Synchronized.

25:47.612 --> 25:49.647
5 Must Be As One.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.949
As One.

25:51.983 --> 25:55.019
Uh...

25:55.053 --> 25:56.320
Oh!

25:56.354 --> 25:59.890
You, The Mother,
You Confuse Them.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.792
Now, Schedule Is The Key,

26:01.826 --> 26:04.094
As Mr. Grover
Fully Appreciates.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.397
Oh! Like Clockwork--

26:06.431 --> 26:09.066
Unfortunately,
Broken Clockwork,

26:09.100 --> 26:11.268
But Fear Not.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.469
I Am Fiona.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.639
Yeah, Home Was A Mess--

26:15.674 --> 26:18.409
Babies Everywhere,
Money Problems, Exhaustion--

26:18.443 --> 26:20.077
And I'm Not Proud Of This,

26:20.111 --> 26:21.445
But I Used
The Family Troubles

26:21.479 --> 26:24.048
To My Advantage.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.249
Oh, No, No, No.

26:25.283 --> 26:27.017
We Have To Send
6 Kids To College,

26:27.052 --> 26:28.385
We Can't Afford
Coffee Anymore.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.555
We Can't Afford
Not To Drink Coffee.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.690
Honey,
Do You Realize

26:32.724 --> 26:34.124
That Just Paying
For Diapers Alone

26:34.159 --> 26:36.660
Is Gonna Empty
Our Bank Account?

26:36.695 --> 26:40.030
Honey, We Can't Afford To Pay Fiona By Ourselves.

26:40.065 --> 26:42.132
I Can't Work Doubles
Forever.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.734
And I Never See You,

26:43.768 --> 26:46.570
And You Never Get
To See The Kids.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.173
I Know.
Quints Just Weren't

26:49.207 --> 26:51.141
Part Of The Plan,
You Know?

26:53.912 --> 26:55.613
Good Morning!

26:55.647 --> 26:58.048
So, School's Going Great,

26:58.083 --> 26:59.450
Math Seems A Little Easier,

26:59.484 --> 27:01.986
And I'm In Art Club.

27:02.020 --> 27:02.987
What's That, Hon?

27:03.021 --> 27:04.254
Uh, That's Good.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.361
Yup, I Chose
My Moment Carefully,

27:10.395 --> 27:11.996
But Can You Blame Me?

27:12.030 --> 27:14.331
I Didn't Think My Parents
Would Approve Of Art Club.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.600
It Wasn't Part Of The Plan,
You Know?

27:16.635 --> 27:18.802
I Was Protecting My Freedom.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.838
I Loved That Freedom.

27:20.872 --> 27:24.341
How Much?
I'll Show You At Dinner.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.644

27:26.678 --> 27:29.480

27:29.514 --> 27:30.514

27:30.548 --> 27:32.116
Yup, Things Had Changed.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.817
I Was No Longer
The Center Of Attention,

27:33.852 --> 27:36.820
And I Was Actually
Doing Well In School.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.489
Sure, It Was Only Art Class,

27:38.523 --> 27:41.392
But I Figured All My Other Grades Would Come Up, Too.

27:45.630 --> 27:46.864

27:46.898 --> 27:49.166

27:49.200 --> 27:51.135
After All,
George Washington Science Magnet

27:51.169 --> 27:53.137
Was Still My Goal,

27:53.171 --> 27:55.439
Even Though
I Really Did Like Art.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.708
You Look Like
A One-Woman Band, Fiona.

27:57.742 --> 28:00.811
Sarcasm, Number 6.
I Do Not Care For Such.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.081
Jamie.
My Name Is Jamie.

28:06.051 --> 28:06.950
Here You Go, Adam.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.552
A Little Art
To Cheer You Up.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.291
Aah! Ooh! Ooh!

28:14.325 --> 28:17.161
Ooh, Oh, It's Nothing.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.562
It's Just A Wee Cramp.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.599
They Don't Like
To Be Still, Do They?

28:22.634 --> 28:24.601
Here You Go, Becky.
I Got You.

28:24.636 --> 28:27.738
Oh, Now Keep On Schedule.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.441
I Want Them
To Pee And Poop And Burp

28:30.475 --> 28:31.608
When I Want Them To.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.377
What, Are You Gonna
Dress Them Alike, Too?

28:33.411 --> 28:34.845
Make Them Take
The Same Classes

28:34.879 --> 28:36.013
And Go To Magnet School
Together?

28:36.047 --> 28:37.948
Well, Don't You Want
The Best For Them?

28:37.982 --> 28:41.518
I Do, But How Do You Know
What's Best For Them?

28:41.553 --> 28:44.788
And That Was The Second Way
Fiona Helped Me.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.090
She Made Me Think.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.257
Because The Truth Was,

28:47.292 --> 28:49.593
My Life Hadn't Changed
As Much As I'd Hoped.

28:49.627 --> 28:51.061
How Did I Know?

28:51.096 --> 28:54.198
Well, Because Some Things
Hadn't Changed At All.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.200
Hey, Dad?

28:56.234 --> 28:57.334
Hmm?

28:57.368 --> 28:58.602
Wouldn't You Rather Be
Playing With The Kids

28:58.636 --> 28:59.837
Than Doing That?

28:59.871 --> 29:01.371
Honey, The Plan,
The Plan.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.639
Don't Forget The Plan.

29:02.674 --> 29:05.242
It's More Important Now That I Stick To It Than Ever,

29:05.276 --> 29:07.177
And So Should You.

29:08.179 --> 29:09.446
Shut Up,
Babies, Shut Up.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.916
Oh, Number 1 Sleeps.
Number 2 Cries.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.119
Number 3 Does Number 1.

29:15.153 --> 29:17.721
I Don't Even Know
Where 4 And 5 Might Be.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.356
Fiona,
What's The Problem?

29:19.390 --> 29:20.958
5 Problems...

29:20.992 --> 29:23.193
And Only One Fiona.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.028
Wait, Fiona!

29:25.063 --> 29:26.497
Please, Don't Leave.

29:26.531 --> 29:27.698
Oh, I Must. I Must.

29:27.732 --> 29:31.235
I Hear Baby Screams
In My Ears At All Hours.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.303
I'm Living A Nightmare.
I Gave It All I Could.

29:33.338 --> 29:34.638
I Really Did,
I'm Telling You.

29:34.672 --> 29:37.608
I'll Take No Money,
But I'll Take My Leave.

29:37.642 --> 29:39.176
And That's It.
That'll Be It.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.677
Fiona, Wait!

29:42.046 --> 29:43.714
Oh, Oh!
What Is It? Oh!

29:43.748 --> 29:45.682
Oh, I Knew There Was
Another One About Somewhere.

29:45.717 --> 29:48.152
I Didn't Know Where,
But I Knew It Was Safe.

29:48.186 --> 29:49.586
Oh, I Knew
It Was Number 4.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.554
Her Name Is Debbie.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.690
Debbie, Number 4,

29:53.725 --> 29:56.293
Number 4, Oh.

29:56.327 --> 29:59.530
Number 4, All The Best
To You, Sweet Child,

29:59.564 --> 30:01.865
And For You Grovers,
Godspeed.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.634
You Know I Tried.
I Really Did Try.

30:03.668 --> 30:07.137
I Gave It Me All,
But Me All Wasn't Good Enough.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.811
Ok, This Is
Just A Roadblock.

30:13.845 --> 30:16.046
I Know Things Look Grim,

30:16.080 --> 30:19.149
But We Are Not
Gonna Panic.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.891
I Will. We Will.
I Can't Handle Them On My Own.

30:27.926 --> 30:30.294
There's Gotta Be Some Kind Of Clear Alternative.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.129
Sitters.
We'll Get Sitters.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.330
We Can't Afford Sitters.

30:33.364 --> 30:36.433
Ok, Oh, Wait! Wait, Wait.
I'll Set Up Volunteers.

30:36.467 --> 30:38.101
Oh, That's A Great Idea.

30:38.136 --> 30:40.470
I'll Circulate Fliers
In The Neighborhood And--

30:40.505 --> 30:42.739
Oh, No, No.
That Will Never Work.

30:42.774 --> 30:45.342
I Could Take Care
Of The Kids.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.578
We Got To Get A Plan.
We Got To Get A New Plan.

30:47.612 --> 30:48.846
Oh, When Are You
Gonna Have Time

30:48.880 --> 30:51.248
To Come Up
With A Plan, Jim?

30:51.282 --> 30:53.183
I Will Take Care
Of The Kids.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.488
You Will, Jamie?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.390
How?

31:58.816 --> 32:01.551
Ok, I Lied.
I Can't Do It.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.654
And You
Shouldn't Have To.

32:03.688 --> 32:04.988
We'll Take Care Of This.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.556
Sitters. It's Simple.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.991
Honey, We Can Barely Afford The Diapers.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.760
Come On.

32:09.794 --> 32:11.161
Just Hold On A Second.

32:11.195 --> 32:13.130
Let Me Just--Let Me Just Think About This A Second.

32:13.164 --> 32:15.532
Now, If I Work 70 Hours

32:15.566 --> 32:16.800
Of Overtime A Week--

32:16.834 --> 32:18.368
No, I-I'll Give Up
My Allowance.

32:18.403 --> 32:21.571
Oh, No, Jamie,
Don't Let This Affect You.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.307
No, But They're
My Family, Too.

32:23.341 --> 32:25.842
I'll Just Give Up My Allowance
To The-- To The Diaper Fund.

32:25.877 --> 32:29.112
I've Got To Go Back Up
To The Babies.

32:29.147 --> 32:30.414
Ok, Here You Go.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.149
There You Go, Honey.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.285
I Got To Go To Work.

32:38.189 --> 32:39.756
Coming, Coming.

32:40.658 --> 32:41.591
Can I Help--

32:41.626 --> 32:43.794
Hello, Little Lady.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.562
You...

32:45.596 --> 32:47.464
That's The Most
Beautiful Thing

32:47.498 --> 32:50.067
I've Ever Seen.

32:50.101 --> 32:52.836
Did Somebody Make A Wish
To The Diaper Genie?

32:52.870 --> 32:55.405
The Answer To Your
Problems Has Arrived.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.275
Jim, Jamie,
I Am Albert Lensley.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.844
I'm Sorry,
Do We Know You?

33:00.878 --> 33:03.613
No, But I Know
All About You

33:03.648 --> 33:06.083
And Your Beautiful,
Blossoming Family.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.552
And I Am Here To Make Your Life A Whole Lot Easier.

33:08.586 --> 33:11.288
Uh, What Exactly Is It That You Do, Mr., Uh, Lensley?

33:11.322 --> 33:13.457
Oh, Please,
Call Me Albert,

33:13.491 --> 33:14.992
And In A Nutshell,

33:15.026 --> 33:16.827
What I Do Is I Get You
Money And Free Gifts.

33:16.861 --> 33:19.162
Like These--Like These
Cutie Pants Diapers.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.398
Why Would Anybody
Give Us Money

33:21.432 --> 33:22.899
Or Anything
For That Matter?

33:22.934 --> 33:25.569
Quints, Jim, Quints.

33:25.603 --> 33:27.037
Oh, I'm Sorry.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.638
Come In. Come In.
Come In.

33:28.673 --> 33:29.840
Maybe Meet Them,
Say Hi.

33:35.079 --> 33:37.681
At This Point We Didn't Know Much About Dear Old Al,

33:37.715 --> 33:41.051
But At Least My Siblings
Took To Him Right Away.

33:41.085 --> 33:43.353
Yeah. Ye--

33:45.990 --> 33:46.890
Oh!

33:46.924 --> 33:49.059
Oh, I Am So Sorry.

33:49.093 --> 33:50.927
No Need To Be.
No, No.

33:50.962 --> 33:52.029
What An Adorable--

33:52.063 --> 33:53.497
You Want To Know
The Truth?

33:53.531 --> 33:56.166
I Really Don't Think
That Was An Accident.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.235
So Why Are
The Quints Marketable?

33:58.269 --> 33:59.936
Babies Are Cute.
You're An Average Family

33:59.971 --> 34:01.872
With The First Quints
In The State,

34:01.906 --> 34:02.906
The Quints Are Famous.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.341
It's An Ideal Situation.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.942
Really? This Is Ideal.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.277
Oh, Absolutely.

34:07.311 --> 34:08.545
Of Course,
It Would Be Better

34:08.579 --> 34:10.880
If They Were Identical.

34:10.915 --> 34:13.417
Ah, Well, Unimportant.
You Work With What You Got,

34:13.451 --> 34:15.318
And You've Got Quints.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.520
Thanks To Albert,

34:16.554 --> 34:19.356
We Signed A Contract
With Cutie Pants Diapers.

34:19.389 --> 34:22.092
That Plus Dad's Salary
Paid For The Sitters.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.194
But Remember,
This Is My Story,

34:24.228 --> 34:26.263
And Albert, Like Fiona,

34:26.297 --> 34:29.666
Helped Me Out
In Unexpected Ways.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.001
Jamie, Can I Talk To You
For A Second?

34:31.034 --> 34:32.369
Sure.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.772
You Know,
For Us To Really Sell Your Brothers And Sisters,

34:35.806 --> 34:38.341
We Need To Focus
Exclusively On The Quints.

34:38.376 --> 34:41.610
Now, If You're Gonna Feel Left Out,
I Need For You To Tell Me,

34:41.646 --> 34:44.514
Because I Want The Whole Family Happy,
After All.

34:44.549 --> 34:47.684
Actually,
That Sounds Pretty Good.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.418
That's The Spirit.

34:49.454 --> 34:50.853
You Know, This Could
Be Good For You.

34:50.888 --> 34:53.090
I Mean,
You'll Have More Time To Do The Things You Like,

34:53.123 --> 34:55.225
While We All Work Hard
Here At Home.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.727
Ok? Good.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.262
Hmm.

34:59.297 --> 35:02.532
So How Did Albert Help Me?

35:02.567 --> 35:05.168
Anyone? Yup.

35:05.203 --> 35:08.071
Albert Made Me Think
About Who I Really Was.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.240
Spooky.

35:12.810 --> 35:15.212
That's Exactly What Your House Looks Like These Days.

35:15.246 --> 35:16.446
What A Mess!

35:16.481 --> 35:17.547
You Know What, Z?

35:17.582 --> 35:19.483
I Really Like This.
Isn't That Weird?

35:19.517 --> 35:21.551
No, It's Fun,

35:21.586 --> 35:22.886
And You're Good At It.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.888
Really?

35:24.922 --> 35:25.889
Thanks.

35:25.923 --> 35:27.090
Oh, I See.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.326
It's Not Enough When
I Tell You You're Good.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.862
No, You Have To Hear It
From Your Friends.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.730
You're A Teacher.
You Have To Be Nice.

35:33.764 --> 35:35.432
No, No.
I'm A Teacher.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.334
I Don't Have To Be
Anything.

35:37.368 --> 35:40.804
The Truth Is, My Friend,
That You Have Talent.

35:40.838 --> 35:44.141
Ok, So I Have Talent,

35:44.175 --> 35:47.377
And I Like Art,
But Now What?

35:47.411 --> 35:48.745
I Mean,
This Is All New To Me.

35:48.779 --> 35:50.046
Well, Ain't It Great?

35:50.081 --> 35:51.715
This Is What You Were Hoping
For When The Quints Came.

35:51.749 --> 35:53.416
It Was?

35:53.451 --> 35:54.451
Wait, That Doesn't Mean

35:54.485 --> 35:55.986
I Have To Give Up
On The Plan, Does It?

35:56.020 --> 35:57.988
No, No, A Lack Of Effort
Is Never Rewarded.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.224
Well, Maybe
You Need A New Plan.

36:01.259 --> 36:04.461
Whoa! That Was
A Heck Of A Thought, Huh?

36:04.495 --> 36:06.296
A New Plan?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.832
No More
G.W. Science Magnet?

36:08.866 --> 36:11.168
I Didn't Even
Want To Think About It,

36:11.202 --> 36:14.404
And Luckily Mr. Blackmer
Changed The Subject.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.773
Now, I've Got An Idea

36:16.807 --> 36:18.008
That Must Be Taken
Seriously--

36:18.042 --> 36:20.944
Absolutely Must.
No Questions Asked.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.179
Wait, That's Not Fair.

36:22.213 --> 36:24.414
I'm A Teacher.
I Don't Have To Be Anything,

36:24.448 --> 36:26.950
Including Fair.
Come On.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.652
Come On. Over Here.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.089
All Right.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.724
Sit Down.

36:35.626 --> 36:38.228
Ok.

36:38.262 --> 36:39.296
Draw People.

36:41.799 --> 36:44.167
People--
Me, Zoe, You.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.235
Why?

36:45.269 --> 36:48.138
Jamie,
You're An Observer.

36:48.172 --> 36:50.473
You See Things
Your Own Way.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.042
Well, I Want To See
What You See

36:52.076 --> 36:54.611
When You, Uh,
Say When You Look At Me.

36:54.645 --> 36:57.347
I Want To See What You See
When You Look In The Mirror.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.381
Or At Me.

36:58.416 --> 37:00.617
I'd Be
A Great Model.

37:03.287 --> 37:04.654
I Don't Think I Can Do It.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.656
All Right.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.959
Portraits In One Lesson.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.894
Observe Details.

37:10.928 --> 37:12.128
Capture Them.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.998
See The Essence
Of The Subject.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.132
Capture It.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.901
View The Soul.

37:17.935 --> 37:20.070
Capture It. Done.

37:20.104 --> 37:21.438
Oh, And, Uh, Jamie?

37:21.472 --> 37:24.040
I Know You Can Do It.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.976
How? How Do You Know?

37:26.010 --> 37:27.477
I'm A Teacher.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.412
I Don't
Have To Tell You.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.617
But Guess Who Really
Got Me Going?

37:33.651 --> 37:35.819
Guess Who Made Art
So Much Fun For Me

37:35.853 --> 37:38.088
That I Wanted
To Draw Nonstop?

37:39.924 --> 37:42.792
Yup, Guess Who Really
Turned My Life Around?

37:42.827 --> 37:45.562
Oh, Come On. Think.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.163
Got It?

37:47.198 --> 37:50.200
Whew.
I Was Worried About You There For A Second.

37:50.234 --> 37:53.370
Come On, Adam.
Smile For Me.

37:53.404 --> 37:54.337
Be Like
Your Brother Eddie.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.306
As If All That
Wasn't Enough,

37:56.340 --> 37:58.174
Our Little Babies
Were Becoming Celebrities,

37:58.209 --> 38:00.243
Thanks To Albert.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.611
And This Is
Their Bedroom.

38:01.646 --> 38:04.648
This Is Where
Our 5 Adorable Children

38:04.682 --> 38:06.983
Eat, Play, And Sleep.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.985
Now You Can Truly Say

38:09.020 --> 38:11.254
You've Been Behind The Scenes
With The Grover Quints.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.257
Uh, Can We Get
A Shot Of You

38:14.292 --> 38:15.759
With The Quints,
Mrs. Grover?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.827
Oh, I Am So Sorry.
I Forgot That Part.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.829
That's Ok, Nancy.
We'll Recover.

38:22.099 --> 38:24.734
Oh, Great. Our Audience
Loves Those Kids.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.636
Aw.
Sure They Love Them.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.371
They Are
Pretty Darn Cute,

38:28.406 --> 38:30.206
You Have To Admit.

38:32.209 --> 38:34.311
Hey, Just
Look At Them Here.

38:34.345 --> 38:36.680
Yup, They Were
Getting Around.

38:36.714 --> 38:37.747
Too Much?

38:37.782 --> 38:40.083
Well, Let's Check In
With Mom And Albert,

38:40.117 --> 38:41.618
Also Known As
Team Quints.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.552
All Right.

38:42.586 --> 38:43.887
We Strike Now
While The Iron Is Hot.

38:43.921 --> 38:46.056
Overexposure
Is Not A Problem.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.657
Ok, But I Don't Want
To Tire 'Em Out.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.659
Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Days They Can't Go, They Can't Go,

38:49.694 --> 38:51.394
But You're Losing Money.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.096
I Mean, The Quints
Are Only A Marketing Tool

38:53.130 --> 38:54.531
For A Year, If That.

38:54.565 --> 38:56.666
A Year?
It Must Be Longer.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.034
Well, Maybe.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.602
I Mean, If We Can Keep
The Quints In The News,

38:59.637 --> 39:00.537
Not Just Commercials.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.305
You Know,
Refresh The Story--

39:02.340 --> 39:04.607
Only Quints In The State,
Blah, Blah, Blah--

39:04.642 --> 39:07.243
Then Maybe We Can Squeeze
Another Year Out Of Them.

39:07.278 --> 39:10.213
Um, College Funds
Would Be Nice.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.948
Oh, Yeah. Sure, Jimbo.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.183
Anything You Say.

39:13.217 --> 39:15.285
Remember, I Only Do Well
If You Do Well,

39:15.319 --> 39:16.453
But I Am Telling You,

39:16.487 --> 39:18.254
Everything Must Be About The Quints, Everything!

39:18.289 --> 39:20.990
We Must Focus, Focus,
Focus, Focus, Focus.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.494
Albert Thought It Was
Cute To Say Things 5 Times.

39:24.528 --> 39:27.163
Anyway, The Point Is
They Did Focus...

39:27.198 --> 39:30.734
Though The Photographers
Didn't Always.

39:32.269 --> 39:35.405
Mom Put Out A Quints
Commemorative "Milford Weekly."

39:35.439 --> 39:37.173
I Hated The Way My Siblings

39:37.208 --> 39:39.509
Were Always Referred To
As "The Quints,"

39:39.543 --> 39:41.111
But I Guess I Was Alone.

39:41.145 --> 39:43.847
The Issue Sold Out 2 Printings
With No Pictures Of Me

39:43.881 --> 39:45.348
And None Of My Lame Poetry.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.118
Coincidence? I Think Not.

39:48.152 --> 39:50.320
And They Treat 'Em
Like A Unit.

39:50.354 --> 39:52.389
It's Quints This
And Quints That.

39:52.423 --> 39:54.524
I Mean, They're
5 Different Kids.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.292
And This Is All Albert's Fault, Right?

39:56.327 --> 40:00.296
Well, Maybe,
But My Mom's Going Along With It, No Problem,

40:00.331 --> 40:01.831
And My Dad's
Never Around.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.467
Look, Jamie, I Don't
Know Your Dad, But...

40:04.502 --> 40:06.002
Well, I Don't Know
Your Mom, Either,

40:06.036 --> 40:07.504
Now That I Think Of It,
So, Uh...

40:07.538 --> 40:08.505
You Can Forget
Everything I'm Gonna Say

40:08.539 --> 40:09.506
Before I Even Say It.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.607
I Always Do.

40:10.641 --> 40:11.641
Me, Too.

40:11.675 --> 40:14.110
I Told Jamie That Was An Art Club Rule.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.578
Oh, Thank You.

40:15.613 --> 40:18.081
Look, Hypothetically,

40:18.115 --> 40:20.116
I Think Your Parents
Are In A Situation

40:20.151 --> 40:24.120
That Has Completely Overwhelmed
Them, But, Jamie, Maybe...

40:24.155 --> 40:28.024
Maybe You Have Just Enough
Distance To See Things More Clearly.

40:28.058 --> 40:28.958
Talk To Them.

40:28.993 --> 40:31.227
Wait. No, Talking
Is Dangerous.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.096
What If They Ask
How School Is Going?

40:33.130 --> 40:34.397
Or What If I
Have To Tell Them

40:34.432 --> 40:35.765
I'm Not Doing
The Science Fair?

40:35.800 --> 40:38.735
Well, You Know,
You Can Direct The Conversation, Jamie,

40:38.769 --> 40:40.003
To Make Your Parents
See Your Point.

40:40.037 --> 40:41.905
Use What I Teach You
In Here.

40:41.939 --> 40:44.474
Cover Your Parents In Bright Red Paint?
Cool!

40:44.508 --> 40:46.476
No. I Was Thinking...

40:46.510 --> 40:49.879
That You Could Use Your
Observational Skills To...

40:49.914 --> 40:52.682
Point Things Out In A Way
That Others Are Forced To See.

40:52.716 --> 40:55.785
But, You Know, If You Want
To Paint Your Parents,

40:55.820 --> 40:58.221
Far Be It From Me
To Stop You.

41:07.097 --> 41:08.865
So Here Was My Plan--

41:08.899 --> 41:12.268
Mix 5 Parts Quints
With 2 Parts Parents

41:12.303 --> 41:13.603
And One Part Jamie,

41:13.637 --> 41:15.772
Stir Until Frothy.

41:19.543 --> 41:20.643
Hey, Look At You.

41:20.678 --> 41:22.178
What're You Doin',
Your Schoolwork There?

41:22.213 --> 41:24.914
Very Impressive.
Look At Our Little Dedicated Student.

41:24.949 --> 41:26.749
That's Me.

41:30.421 --> 41:34.357
A Busy Day Puts 'Em
To Sleep Every Time.

41:36.293 --> 41:37.627
Hey, Don't Stay Up
Too Late.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.928
Ok.

41:42.600 --> 41:47.136
Ok. Maybe They'll Stop.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.240
She Won't Stop.
That's Becky.

41:50.274 --> 41:51.941
How Do You Know?

41:51.976 --> 41:53.676
Because That's Becky's "Hold Me" Cry.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.078
See, If You
Don't Hold Her,

41:55.112 --> 41:56.412
Then She Won't
Stop Crying

41:56.447 --> 41:58.248
Until All The Other
Babies Are Up.

42:00.150 --> 42:04.721
Well, Let Me
Just Handle It. Ok?

42:04.755 --> 42:07.056
Ok. Ok?
All Right. Come On.

42:07.091 --> 42:09.526
There You Go. Ok.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.628
Ok.

42:11.662 --> 42:13.296
What Am I Doin' Wrong?

42:13.330 --> 42:15.431
That's Not Becky,
For Starters.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.234
It's The Second Bassinet.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.938
Dad, Look At The Baby In Your Arms.

42:21.972 --> 42:23.006
You See The Dimples?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.040
Yeah.

42:24.074 --> 42:25.275
Ok, Then You've
Got Charlie,

42:25.309 --> 42:28.978
The Twinkly-Eyed, Curious,
Dimpled Little Boy.

42:29.013 --> 42:30.547
Honey, They All
Have Daddy's Dimples,

42:30.581 --> 42:33.750
And I'm Telling You Right Now This Is Definitely Becky.
See?

42:33.784 --> 42:36.352
Hello. Not Becky.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.555
What Is Charlie Doin' In Becky's Bassinet?

42:38.589 --> 42:39.556
I Put Him There.

42:39.590 --> 42:40.790
Why?

42:40.824 --> 42:41.958
Honestly?

42:41.992 --> 42:43.459
I Wanted To See
If You Two

42:43.494 --> 42:44.627
Could Put Them Back
Where They Belong.

42:44.662 --> 42:47.430
Well, That's A Terrible Thing To Say, Jamie.

42:47.464 --> 42:48.798
We Love The Quints.

42:48.832 --> 42:50.366
I Know You Love Them,
Mom.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.102
Just Take This
As A, Uh, A Challenge.

42:55.039 --> 42:57.173
Ok, Fine.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.010
Don't Worry About It.
We'll Figure It Out.

43:01.045 --> 43:02.445
Mommy And Daddy
Will Figure It Out. Ok.

43:02.479 --> 43:05.949
All Right. Adam.

43:06.917 --> 43:11.087
Oh. It's Not Adam.
This Is...

43:11.121 --> 43:12.055
Wait.

43:12.089 --> 43:13.856
What Do You See?

43:13.891 --> 43:17.160
Um, A Big Smile.

43:17.194 --> 43:18.461
And That Means?

43:18.495 --> 43:21.230
Eddie.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.032
Oh, Uh, Here.

43:23.067 --> 43:25.401
Hey, Hey.
Here We Go.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.037
Oh, Yeah.
Oh, There You Go.

43:28.072 --> 43:30.306
This Is Debbie.

43:30.341 --> 43:32.976
She Wrinkles Her Nose
All The Time, Dad.

43:33.010 --> 43:36.079
Honey, They All Wrinkle
Their Nose All The Time.

43:36.113 --> 43:38.081
Good Point.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.416
Come On, Honey.
Come On. Come On.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.986
Oh, I Know This One.

43:43.020 --> 43:44.787
This Is Daddy's
Big Boy Adam.

43:44.822 --> 43:47.357
Yes. The Biggest
And The Bounciest.

43:47.391 --> 43:49.892
See, Jamie,
We Know Our Kids.

43:49.927 --> 43:50.827
Well, Good,

43:50.861 --> 43:52.395
Because Sometimes
I Wonder If You Know

43:52.429 --> 43:53.696
That You Have
5 Babies,

43:53.731 --> 43:56.332
Not Just One Set
Of Quints.

43:57.768 --> 44:00.103
Well, No Matter What We've Got,
They Need Their Sleep.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.739
2 Baby Food Companies Are Going
To Interview Them Tomorrow,

44:02.773 --> 44:05.041
And I Know They're
Looking Forward To That.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.409
Here You Go.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.212
Good Night.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.450
Good Night.

44:17.287 --> 44:19.455
The Truth Is
I Wasn't So Worried

44:19.490 --> 44:22.258
About My Siblings Being
Treated As Individuals.

44:22.292 --> 44:24.127
I Thought I Was,
But The Real Truth

44:24.161 --> 44:25.695
Is That I Could Tell
My Parents

44:25.729 --> 44:28.297
Were Trying To Force Their Hopes
And Dreams On The Quints,

44:28.332 --> 44:30.466
Just Like They Had
Done To Me All My Life.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.635
You Know, Maybe You Already
Saw This Coming,

44:32.670 --> 44:35.471
But This Was More About Me
Than The Quints.

44:37.274 --> 44:40.209
Come In.

44:40.244 --> 44:42.311
Ok?
Sure.

44:51.488 --> 44:53.089
Jamie, I--
I Feel Terrible.

44:53.123 --> 44:56.626
I Do. I Couldn't Tell
My Own Babies Apart.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.728
It's Not That
I Don't Love 'Em.

44:58.762 --> 45:00.430
You Know I Love 'Em,
Right?

45:00.464 --> 45:01.664
I Know That.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.266
You've Been Working.

45:03.300 --> 45:06.936
Which I Know, In Your Words,
Is A Lame Excuse.

45:10.007 --> 45:11.774
You Know, I Remember
The Day You Were Born.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.777
You Were So Beautiful.

45:14.812 --> 45:16.946
We Were So Thrilled.

45:16.980 --> 45:20.083
You Know,
You Were Everything We Ever Dreamed Of.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.651
I Was Just A Baby.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.688
That's Not Really
How It Works.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.657
You Know,
You Were Our Baby.

45:27.691 --> 45:30.226
You Were So
Beautiful And Perfect.

45:30.260 --> 45:31.461
Your Mother And I,
You Know,

45:31.495 --> 45:34.197
We Vowed To Give You Anything You Would Ever Need.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.732
I Think We've Done That
Up To This Point.

45:35.766 --> 45:38.968
I Know We've Loved Doing
Every Minute Of It.

45:43.107 --> 45:45.108
You Know, But The 5--

45:46.143 --> 45:48.878
I--I Don't Have A Plan,
You Know?

45:48.912 --> 45:50.680
I Don't Know
What I'm Doing.

45:50.714 --> 45:53.549
Just Love 'Em, Dad.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.518
Love 'Em Like You Love Me.

45:57.788 --> 45:59.622
I Will.

46:02.192 --> 46:04.193
You Know What?
I Think That I Love You

46:04.228 --> 46:06.562
As Much Today As I Did
The Day You Were Born.

46:08.499 --> 46:09.432
Maybe More.

46:10.868 --> 46:13.870
Ok. Ha Ha.

46:16.173 --> 46:18.074
Over The Next
Month Or So,

46:18.108 --> 46:19.609
Dad Really Did Try.

46:19.643 --> 46:21.711
He Tried So Hard,
In Fact,

46:21.745 --> 46:24.480
That He Got Sucked Into
The Whole Team-Quints Thing.

46:24.515 --> 46:27.283
As For Me,
I Decided It Was Time To Focus On The New Me.

46:28.185 --> 46:29.952
Yes, Me As An Individual.

46:29.987 --> 46:31.287
So,
You Gonna Tell 'Em?

46:31.321 --> 46:34.390
I Even Vowed To Let Mom
And Dad In On The Changes...

46:34.424 --> 46:35.691
Slowly, Of Course.

46:35.726 --> 46:36.893
Oh, Hi, Jamie.

46:36.927 --> 46:38.394
I Can't Make
Dinner Tonight,

46:38.428 --> 46:40.930
But We're Still On For The
Parent-Teacher Conferences Tomorrow.

46:40.964 --> 46:42.498
Your Dad And I
Are Very Excited.

46:42.533 --> 46:44.167
You Know,
I Really Like This One.

46:44.201 --> 46:45.501
I Mean,
I Like The Two-Tone.

46:45.536 --> 46:47.436
Let's Compare It
Against The Strollers.

46:47.471 --> 46:52.141
So, Mom, I, Uh,
I Wanted To Tell You About Science... Fair.

46:52.176 --> 46:54.911
I'm Not Entering
This Year, Ok?

46:56.947 --> 46:58.681
Great.

46:58.715 --> 47:00.249
You're My Witness,
Zoe.

47:00.284 --> 47:01.951
I Told Her.

47:01.985 --> 47:02.919
I'll Back You Up,
Jamesy.

47:02.953 --> 47:04.287
That's What Friends
Are For.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.522
Unless She's Mad.
Then You're On Your Own.

47:06.557 --> 47:07.924
Gee, Thanks.

47:07.958 --> 47:10.793
Come On.
Let's Go Up To My Room And Listen To That Cd.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.229
For Once,
Mom Didn't Seem To Care

47:13.263 --> 47:15.231
If I Won
A Blue Ribbon Or Not.

47:15.265 --> 47:16.232
I Liked That New Attitude.

47:16.266 --> 47:17.500
I Was Even Starting To Think

47:17.534 --> 47:19.936
That Parent-Teacher Conferences Wouldn't Be So Bad.

47:19.970 --> 47:21.704
Oh, The Grovers.
What A Pleasure.

47:21.738 --> 47:23.306
I Have Heard
So Much About You.

47:23.340 --> 47:25.641
Mr. Blackmer,
How Ya Doin'? Good, Good.

47:25.676 --> 47:27.176
I Can Barely Contain
Myself Another Second.

47:27.211 --> 47:30.012
I Must Tell You,
Jamie Is Such A Special Talent.

47:30.047 --> 47:33.616
In Fact, She's Getting
An A-Plus In My Class.

47:33.650 --> 47:36.586
Ohh, Ohh, My Little Girl,
An A-Plus.

47:36.620 --> 47:38.454
It's The Happiest
Day Of My Life.

47:38.488 --> 47:39.655
Oh, We Have To
Celebrate!

47:39.690 --> 47:40.623
A Party.

47:40.657 --> 47:41.557
Yes, A Party.

47:41.592 --> 47:42.925
All This
For Me?

47:42.960 --> 47:43.926
Yes, For You.
You Deserve It.

47:43.961 --> 47:45.828
You Got
An A-Plus!

47:54.504 --> 47:57.139
You're Not Buying This,
Are You?

47:57.174 --> 47:59.942
Good, 'Cause If You Thought
This Was What Really Happened,

47:59.977 --> 48:01.978
You Weren't
Paying Attention.

48:02.012 --> 48:05.248
Now, Go To Detention.

48:05.282 --> 48:07.984
You Wanna Know
What Really Happened?

48:25.002 --> 48:27.136
Face It, Jamie.
You Been Stood Up.

48:27.170 --> 48:28.271
I Just...

48:28.305 --> 48:30.506
I Mean,
We Knew Your Parents Wouldn't Come,

48:30.540 --> 48:33.175
But This Is My Mom And
Dad We're Talking About.

48:33.210 --> 48:37.246
I Mean, Why Would I Work So Hard At
School For Them If They Don't Even Care?

48:37.281 --> 48:39.148
The Grades Are For You.

48:39.182 --> 48:41.217
Where Would I Be If
I Did It For My Folks?

48:41.251 --> 48:43.052
It's Different
For You.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.587
You're A Genius.

48:44.621 --> 48:45.922
It's Not Different.

48:45.956 --> 48:48.357
I'm Happy When I Do Well.
You Should Be, Too.

48:49.626 --> 48:52.595
Yeah, Well,
They Still Should Have Been Here.

48:52.629 --> 48:54.163
Yeah, I Agree,

48:54.197 --> 48:57.566
But Go Tell Them, Jamie.
Don't Tell Me.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.136
Wacky, Huh?

49:00.170 --> 49:03.506
Here I Was About To Yell At My
Parents For Not Paying Attention.

49:03.540 --> 49:07.376
Once Again, The Thing I Thought
Would Solve All My Problems Hadn't.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.178
Man, Life Sure Is Tricky.

49:09.212 --> 49:11.547
Did All Of Our
Baby-Sitters Quit?

49:11.581 --> 49:13.049
I Hope Not.

49:13.083 --> 49:15.685
No Surprise Disasters
While I Been Gone?

49:15.719 --> 49:17.520
What Are You
Talking About, Jamie?

49:17.554 --> 49:19.322
What Am I
Talking About?

49:19.356 --> 49:22.291
Hello?
Parent-Teacher Conferences.

49:23.160 --> 49:25.261
Oh, No, Honey.
Did We...

49:25.295 --> 49:27.463
That Was Tonight, Honey?
I'm So Sorry.

49:27.497 --> 49:28.831
I Know I Wrote It
In My Planner.

49:28.865 --> 49:31.233
So?
What Happened?

49:31.268 --> 49:33.135
I Had To Work
Overtime.

49:33.170 --> 49:35.938
And Tomorrow's Such A Big Day, Honey.
I Got Caught Up.

49:35.973 --> 49:39.141
Tomorrow's Big? You Know,
Today Was Kind Of Key.

49:39.176 --> 49:40.576
I Know, I Know,

49:40.610 --> 49:44.246
But The Quints Have Their First
National Commercial Tomorrow.

49:44.281 --> 49:45.214
It's The Big Time,
Jamie.

49:45.248 --> 49:46.682
But, Honey,

49:46.717 --> 49:50.152
You Have Every Right
To Be Mad At Us.

49:52.622 --> 49:54.523
Do You Know What
Could Make This Better?

49:54.558 --> 49:56.258
Turning Back Time?

49:56.293 --> 49:59.895
I Can't Do That,
But You Know What Might Help?

49:59.930 --> 50:02.565
I Could Talk To Albert About
Getting You Into The Commercial.

50:02.599 --> 50:04.900
That's Not Gonna
Make It Better.

50:06.303 --> 50:08.304
Look, I Know We've Been Way
Too Focused On The Quints,

50:08.338 --> 50:09.572
And I'm Sorry...

50:09.606 --> 50:12.274
But This Way, You Could
Be Part Of That With Us.

50:12.309 --> 50:14.377
Really?
All Of Us, Together?

50:14.411 --> 50:16.379
Yeah, You Know What?
That Is A Great Idea.

50:16.413 --> 50:17.947
Tomorrow Can Start
The New Beginning

50:17.981 --> 50:20.316
Of A Whole New Way Of Life For This Entire Family.

50:20.350 --> 50:22.218
Uh, Whatever.

50:22.252 --> 50:24.253
Albert's Not
Gonna Go For It.

50:24.287 --> 50:25.554
Uh, Do You Guys
Have A Second?

50:25.622 --> 50:27.656
Jamie Wants To Be
In The Commercial.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.625
Yeah, And We Think
It's A Great Idea.

50:31.495 --> 50:33.029
Sure, By All Means.

50:34.865 --> 50:36.665
Now, Can I Talk To You
About Thursday?

50:36.700 --> 50:38.267
Hey, Huh?

50:38.301 --> 50:40.703
Believe It Or Not,
That's For Real.

50:40.737 --> 50:43.372
It Was A Shock To Me, Too.
It Was Good, Though.

50:43.407 --> 50:44.974
I Needed To Rejoin
The Family.

50:45.008 --> 50:46.008
Action.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.945
The Grover Quints Use Cutie Pants Diapers.

50:53.850 --> 50:55.818
Jim! I--I Need
To Speak To You.

50:55.852 --> 50:57.820
What? Huh?

50:57.854 --> 50:59.321
So, Jamie Won't Come
Out Of The Truck.

50:59.356 --> 51:00.289
What?

51:00.323 --> 51:01.323
She Won't Come Out
Of The Truck.

51:01.358 --> 51:02.291
Why Not?

51:02.325 --> 51:03.292
She Has To Be Ready
In 5 Minutes.

51:03.326 --> 51:04.293
She Won't Come Out
Of The Truck.

51:04.327 --> 51:05.327
Look, Albert,
It's Gonna Be Fine.

51:05.362 --> 51:06.328
I'll Handle It, Ok?

51:06.363 --> 51:07.897
It'll Be Fine.
Breathe, Buddy.

51:07.931 --> 51:09.465
Breathe, Breathe, Breathe.

51:09.499 --> 51:12.034
Hey, Uh...

51:12.936 --> 51:13.969
Honey, Come On Out.

51:14.004 --> 51:15.204
No.

51:15.238 --> 51:16.505
You See?

51:16.540 --> 51:18.174
Honey, It's Daddy.
Everything's Fine.

51:18.208 --> 51:19.408
Come On Out.
Come On.

51:19.443 --> 51:21.777
No, I'm Not
Gonna Do This.

51:21.812 --> 51:24.647
Jamie, You Get To Be Part Of The Grover-Quints Magic.

51:24.681 --> 51:25.614
You Can Do It.

51:30.854 --> 51:34.290
I Want A Different Part.

51:34.324 --> 51:37.026
Now... There Are
Actors Out There

51:37.060 --> 51:39.261
Who Would Be Grateful
To Wear That Diaper.

51:39.296 --> 51:42.498
Then Call One Of Them.

51:42.532 --> 51:43.499
No, Wait.

51:43.533 --> 51:44.834
Jamie, Wait.

51:48.405 --> 51:51.307
I Know.
That Was Great!

51:51.341 --> 51:53.275
Oh, Jamie,
I Can't Believe You Missed It.

51:53.310 --> 51:55.678
The Quints
Were Fantastic.

51:55.712 --> 51:58.314
Yeah, Whatever.

51:59.449 --> 52:02.518
I'm Sorry Things
Didn't Work Out, Jamie.

52:02.552 --> 52:04.453
You Know, It Would
Have Been Really Great

52:04.488 --> 52:06.689
Having You Dancing Alongside
Your Brothers And Sisters.

52:06.723 --> 52:08.524
Of Course,
They Would Have Been Front And Center,

52:08.558 --> 52:09.725
As We've Agreed,

52:09.759 --> 52:12.261
But You Could Have Been
Part Of The Magic. Ha.

52:12.295 --> 52:13.295
Oh, It Just Would
Have Been Nice

52:13.330 --> 52:15.364
If You Had Been There With Them,
You Know?

52:15.398 --> 52:17.333
Remember, Jamie,
To Help The Family,

52:17.367 --> 52:19.068
We All Need
To Think Quints.

52:19.102 --> 52:21.904
So, It's All About
The Quints, Huh?

52:21.938 --> 52:23.072
What About Me?

52:24.141 --> 52:25.307
Well, You're Still
Our Jamie, Honey.

52:25.342 --> 52:26.308
That Hasn't Changed.

52:26.343 --> 52:28.244
No, Of Course It Hasn't,

52:28.278 --> 52:30.179
But The Quints
As A Marketing Unit

52:30.213 --> 52:31.514
Are Already
Running Out Of Steam.

52:31.581 --> 52:33.349
I Mean, We Need To Keep
Pushing Them Out There,

52:33.383 --> 52:36.418
And We Need To Refresh The
Story In A Noncommercial Way.

52:36.453 --> 52:40.990
We Need News,
And Now Is Not The Time For Any Of Us To Be Selfish.

52:42.025 --> 52:43.926
Here's Another
Little Life Lesson.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.795
Sometimes When Someone
Tells You Not To Be Selfish,

52:46.830 --> 52:49.064
It's Because
They Are Selfish.

52:49.783 --> 52:50.749
So, What's Up?

52:50.784 --> 52:51.884
Big Problems
At Home?

52:51.952 --> 52:54.553
Yeah, It's Quints This,
Quints That.

52:54.588 --> 52:56.155
It's Like
I've Disappeared.

52:56.189 --> 52:58.224
Maybe You Should Run Around
Naked And Pee On People.

52:58.258 --> 52:59.592
That Always Gets Laughs.

53:01.361 --> 53:04.230
That's Cuter From A Baby,
Not From An Invisible Child.

53:04.264 --> 53:06.365
But I Thought
That's What You Wanted.

53:06.399 --> 53:08.000
You Were So Happy When
They Had The Quints.

53:08.034 --> 53:09.735
Ok, So, I Was Wrong.

53:09.769 --> 53:10.970
Is That What
You Wanted To Hear?

53:11.004 --> 53:13.172
No, I Want To Hear That You're Going To Make Them

53:13.206 --> 53:14.139
Pay Attention To You!

53:14.174 --> 53:16.675
Whoa, Angry Brad.
Never Seen That.

53:16.710 --> 53:18.143
You Found Yourself,
Jamie.

53:18.178 --> 53:19.845
Now Don't Let Anyone
Take You For Granted.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.380
Show Your Parents
The Real You.

53:21.414 --> 53:22.348
They Don't Care.

53:22.382 --> 53:23.282
Oh, Give Me A Break.

53:23.316 --> 53:24.450
They're Distracted,
Sure,

53:24.484 --> 53:26.318
But Think Back
Before The Quints.

53:26.353 --> 53:27.353
You Know
How Much They Care.

53:27.387 --> 53:28.320
That Was Caring?

53:28.355 --> 53:29.822
They Drove Me Nuts.

53:29.856 --> 53:32.758
I Would Give Every Blue Ribbon I've Ever Gotten

53:32.792 --> 53:36.095
For One Look...
Like Your Mom Gives You

53:36.129 --> 53:38.297
When You Walk Through The
Door After A Day At School.

53:39.799 --> 53:41.533
Ok, So, Fine.

53:41.568 --> 53:42.768
They Love Me.

53:42.802 --> 53:45.471
Man, I Can't Believe You Talked Me To Come Here.

53:45.505 --> 53:48.140
It's Ruined My Day.

53:55.015 --> 53:57.449
It's Not As Easy
As He Says, You Know.

53:57.484 --> 53:58.484
He Didn't Say
It Was Easy.

53:58.518 --> 53:59.652
He Just Said
To Deal With It.

53:59.686 --> 54:00.786
It's Not Fair.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.389
The Quints Were Supposed
To Make Everything Easier.

54:03.423 --> 54:05.491
Now They've Just
Mucked Everything Up.

54:06.426 --> 54:08.727
Deep In Conversation,
I See.

54:08.762 --> 54:10.429
May I Intrude?

54:10.463 --> 54:13.732
Is Magnet Really The Better School For Me,
Mr. Blackmer?

54:13.767 --> 54:16.535
Yeah, Great Chattin' With Ya.
Bye, Now.

54:16.569 --> 54:18.971
No, Seriously.

54:19.005 --> 54:22.341
Yes, Washington
Is A Great School, Jamie,

54:22.375 --> 54:23.609
But It's Geared
To Math And Science.

54:23.643 --> 54:25.644
Grades Rule.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.013
But People Go To College
From G.W.

54:28.048 --> 54:30.115
Yeah, Well,
They Go To College From Milford High, Too.

54:30.150 --> 54:31.417
Plus, If It Matters,

54:31.451 --> 54:33.886
Milford's Got
A Much Better Art Program.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.187
Some Of The Most Successful
People In Life

54:35.221 --> 54:36.388
Haven't Even
Finished High School,

54:36.423 --> 54:38.090
And There Are
College Graduates

54:38.124 --> 54:39.758
Who Never Amount
To Anything...

54:39.793 --> 54:41.427
And Do You Know
What The Secret Is?

54:41.461 --> 54:42.594
No Clue.

54:42.629 --> 54:43.629
Me, Neither.

54:43.663 --> 54:45.230
Ah, Shoot.

54:45.265 --> 54:46.899
I Was Hoping...

54:46.933 --> 54:48.500
Aw, Well.

54:48.535 --> 54:51.937
Look, Jamie,
I Can Promise You This.

54:51.972 --> 54:54.440
Life Will Go On
If You Don't Get Into G.W.,

54:54.474 --> 54:56.442
And You'll Still Have
Every Chance Of Succeeding

54:56.476 --> 54:58.344
As Long
As You Try Hard.

54:58.378 --> 55:00.646
Your Future
Always Lies With You.

55:00.680 --> 55:02.314
Plus, I Know This.

55:02.349 --> 55:03.849
You Have
A Lot Of Talent,

55:03.883 --> 55:06.819
And You've Found Something
That You Love.

55:06.853 --> 55:08.988
I Wish My Parents
Could See That.

55:09.022 --> 55:11.991
All Right, Well, Then,
Why Don't You Try Telling Them

55:12.025 --> 55:14.827
That Your Sketches Are Going
To Be Part Of The Main Exhibit

55:14.861 --> 55:16.428
At The School Art Show.

55:16.463 --> 55:18.931
Yeah, Right,
Like They'd Really--

55:21.134 --> 55:22.401
Are You Kidding Me?

55:22.435 --> 55:23.869
Heh Heh. Nope.

55:23.903 --> 55:26.005
Jamie,
Your Stuff Is Great.

55:26.039 --> 55:27.873
You Really Capture
Those Kids.

55:27.907 --> 55:29.541
Look, I Was Gonna Tell You
The Good News Later,

55:29.576 --> 55:31.310
But This Seemed Like
A Perfect Moment.

55:31.344 --> 55:32.444
Holy Cow.

55:32.479 --> 55:34.680
He Isn't Kidding.

55:34.714 --> 55:36.482
Jamie, Excellent.
I'm Gonna Tell Everyone

55:36.516 --> 55:38.550
I Knew You Before
You Were Famous.

55:39.652 --> 55:41.320
Yes, Yes, Yes, Yay.

55:42.222 --> 55:44.056
Ok, Everyone
At The Table.

55:44.090 --> 55:45.758
I Have An Announcement
To Make.

55:47.594 --> 55:51.230
Well...
This Is Very Exciting.

55:52.899 --> 55:57.936
My Drawings Are Going To Be In The
Main Exhibit At The School Art Show.

55:59.072 --> 56:01.206
And That's Good?

56:01.241 --> 56:04.043
Art Show...
And Your Point Is?

56:04.077 --> 56:07.646
Hey, Come On, This Is
A Really, Really Big Honor.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.816
Well, Honey,
Why Would We Care About You Getting An Honor?

56:10.850 --> 56:12.951
Jamie, We've Never Cared
About That Type Of Thing.

56:12.986 --> 56:14.119
Are You Feeling Ok?

56:16.089 --> 56:19.124
Oh, Come On, Now, People.
I'm Just Messing With You.

56:19.159 --> 56:20.859
Now, Where Were We?

56:21.861 --> 56:23.762
In The Main Exhibit?

56:23.797 --> 56:26.065
Why, That's Quite An Honor,
Isn't It?

56:26.099 --> 56:29.134
Yes. Only One Person
Gets Chosen From Each Class.

56:29.169 --> 56:31.437
And You Know, I Wasn't Even Really Trying.
It Just Kind Of Happened.

56:31.471 --> 56:32.638
No!

56:32.672 --> 56:33.705
It Didn't Just Happen.

56:33.740 --> 56:34.840
It Happened Because
My Little Girl

56:34.874 --> 56:36.108
Has Her Dad's
Artistic Eye.

56:36.142 --> 56:38.110
Mmm! That's
How It Happened.

56:38.144 --> 56:40.245
Main Exhibit, Huh?
Ha! Wow!

56:40.313 --> 56:42.114
Mr. Blackmer Says
My Stuff Is Really Good.

56:42.148 --> 56:45.017
It's All Drawings Of Adam And Becky And Charlie--

56:45.051 --> 56:48.120
The Quints.
Yes, We've Seen You Draw Them.

56:48.154 --> 56:50.522
You Must Be Very Good, Jamie. Congratulations.

56:50.557 --> 56:51.957
Why, Thank You, Albert.

56:51.991 --> 56:53.158
Ok, I Have To Go To Work.
Hey, Wait A Second.

56:53.193 --> 56:54.526
When Can We
See The Exhibit?

56:54.561 --> 56:55.794
Gala Opening In 4 Days,

56:55.829 --> 56:56.762
Saturday Night.

56:56.796 --> 56:57.896
Be There.
Absolutely.

56:57.931 --> 56:58.831
Oh.

56:58.865 --> 57:00.666
Mmm!
Love You, Honey.

57:00.700 --> 57:01.600
See You, Albert.

57:01.634 --> 57:02.534
Bye.

57:02.569 --> 57:05.337
Oh, This Is
So Wonderful.

57:05.371 --> 57:06.338
Yup.

57:06.372 --> 57:07.906
Things Were Good Again.

57:07.941 --> 57:10.242
Best Of All,
I Had Found Myself,

57:10.276 --> 57:13.145
And My Parents Had Found
The New Me And Embraced Me.

57:14.114 --> 57:15.214
Now, That Happy Ending

57:15.248 --> 57:17.082
Can't Be Too Far Away Now,
Can It?

57:17.117 --> 57:19.551
The Saturday School Art Show
Made This A Big Week,

57:19.586 --> 57:21.687
But It Kept Getting
Bigger And Bigger.

57:21.721 --> 57:23.388
Hey, There She Is,
Our Budding Van Gogh.

57:23.423 --> 57:25.724
Mmm! Mmm!
Good Morning.

57:25.758 --> 57:26.758
Morning.

57:26.793 --> 57:28.494
Oh, I Asked Mr. Blackmer To Save You Seats

57:28.528 --> 57:30.662
At The Awards Ceremony.
I Hope That Was Ok.

57:30.697 --> 57:32.698
Anything You Want.
It's Your Night.

57:35.668 --> 57:37.069
Good Morning.

57:37.103 --> 57:39.905
No, No, Strike That.
It's A Great Morning.

57:39.973 --> 57:41.673
Hey, Albert, What's,
Uh-- What's Goin' On?

57:41.708 --> 57:43.542
Did You Just Get Paid Today?

57:43.576 --> 57:45.811
Well, In A Sense,
We All Did.

57:45.845 --> 57:47.746
Jim, Nancy...

57:47.780 --> 57:49.648
I Have Created A Huge
Media Moment For You.

57:49.682 --> 57:51.650
We Will Refresh The Story
Of The Quints

57:51.684 --> 57:53.185
In A Totally New Way.

57:53.219 --> 57:54.887
It's A Winner.
Yeah?

57:56.189 --> 57:58.090
"The Governor's Parents
Of The Year Gala Dinner."

57:58.124 --> 57:59.324
We're Invited?

57:59.359 --> 58:01.460
It's Better Than That.

58:01.494 --> 58:02.628
You're The Guests Of Honor.

58:02.662 --> 58:04.396
Oh, I Am Good.

58:04.430 --> 58:06.832
We Are Parents
Of The Year?

58:06.866 --> 58:09.001
Ha Ha.
That's Amazing, Albert.

58:09.035 --> 58:11.136
I Have Been Lobbying
For This From The Start.

58:11.171 --> 58:14.606
The Exposure, The Prestige,
This Is A Real Break.

58:14.641 --> 58:17.776
This Could Add A Good Year
To The Quints' Glory Time.

58:17.810 --> 58:19.444
Parents Of The Year...

58:19.479 --> 58:20.479
It's Such An Honor.

58:21.881 --> 58:22.814
Oh.

58:23.816 --> 58:26.818
Thank You, Albert.
That's Fantastic.

58:30.590 --> 58:33.759
And It's For Us, Jim,
Not Just The Quints.

58:33.793 --> 58:35.994
It's Nice
To Be Recognized.

58:37.463 --> 58:38.363
Oh.

58:38.398 --> 58:39.965
I'm Gonna Go
Tell The Quints.

58:39.999 --> 58:41.800
They'll Be
So Proud.

58:41.834 --> 58:44.303
Whoa. I'd Better Get To Work...
Dad Of The Year.

58:44.337 --> 58:45.704
Ha Ha. Ok.

58:45.738 --> 58:46.672
Thanks, Albert.

58:46.706 --> 58:49.174
Ok, Then. Ahh.

59:19.339 --> 59:21.306
Morning, Jamie.

59:21.341 --> 59:23.909
Wow.
She Sure Is Moving.

59:37.490 --> 59:39.858
Jamie, What Are You Doing?

59:40.793 --> 59:42.594
Jamie, Hey.
Jamie, Stop It.

59:43.463 --> 59:45.797
Give That Back!
It's Mine!

59:45.832 --> 59:47.599
Give It To Me!
It's Mine.

59:47.634 --> 59:49.401
Give It Back!

59:49.435 --> 59:50.769
Tell Us What's Wrong.

59:50.803 --> 59:52.404
James,
What Happened?

59:55.875 --> 59:59.044
My Parents Are Gonna
Go Meet The Governor.

01:00:00.213 --> 01:00:02.547
Uh, Uh, That Would
Really Bother Me, Too.

01:00:02.582 --> 01:00:05.217
No! They're
Parents Of The Year.

01:00:05.251 --> 01:00:07.152
Right, And This
Makes You Mad?

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:11.657
There's This Big Dinner
In Their Honor,

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.626
And It's The Same Night
As The Art Show...

01:00:14.661 --> 01:00:17.929
And Guess Which One They're Going To.
Just Guess.

01:00:21.467 --> 01:00:23.769
It's Not Fair,
You Know?

01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:28.707
I Finally Do Somethin' That
Should Make Them Proud Of Me,

01:00:28.741 --> 01:00:31.777
But It's Just--
It's Not Enough.

01:00:31.811 --> 01:00:33.545
I Mean,
I Try My Best,

01:00:33.579 --> 01:00:36.181
But They Just
Forget About Me Anyway.

01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:37.916
They Didn't
Forget About You.

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:39.384
Yes, They Did.

01:00:39.419 --> 01:00:42.154
They Said That They Were Going To The Dinner.

01:00:42.188 --> 01:00:43.855
They Knew
Which Night It Was.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:47.526
We Were Just Talking
About The Art Show....

01:00:48.461 --> 01:00:50.529
Right Then.

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:51.563
I Mean,
What's The Point?

01:00:51.597 --> 01:00:52.664
No Matter What I Do,

01:00:52.699 --> 01:00:55.600
It's Never
Gonna Be Enough.

01:00:57.337 --> 01:00:58.337
Wow.

01:00:58.371 --> 01:01:02.774
You Sure Do
Rip Fast, Huh?

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:06.645
Hey, That's Ok.
It's All Right. Uh...

01:01:06.679 --> 01:01:08.980
It Looks Like We Still Have A Few Here.

01:01:09.015 --> 01:01:10.182
I'll Let You
Make Some More.

01:01:10.216 --> 01:01:13.085
I'm Not Going To The Art Show,
Mr. Blackmer.

01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:15.287
Didn't You Hear
Anything I Said?

01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:17.689
Hey, I Turned Down
A Lot Of Dates

01:01:17.724 --> 01:01:20.092
To Be Free
That Saturday Night.

01:01:20.126 --> 01:01:22.561
Well, I Don't Want
To Go There Anymore.

01:01:22.595 --> 01:01:24.629
I'll Just Stay Home
With The Quints

01:01:24.664 --> 01:01:26.498
And Let My Parents
Have Their Fun.

01:01:26.532 --> 01:01:28.200
That's Not What You Really Want To Do,
Is It?

01:01:29.135 --> 01:01:31.636
It Is.

01:01:31.671 --> 01:01:33.772
Fine, Then.

01:01:33.806 --> 01:01:35.140
Well, Your Art
Will Be Lonely,

01:01:35.174 --> 01:01:37.642
And We'll Miss You,
But, You,

01:01:37.677 --> 01:01:38.643
Since You're Not
A Teacher,

01:01:38.678 --> 01:01:40.679
You Have To Do
What You Have To Do.

01:01:47.153 --> 01:01:50.188
And That's The Way
Things Went For A Few Days.

01:01:50.223 --> 01:01:51.990
I Wasn't Really Happy.

01:01:52.024 --> 01:01:54.025
I Felt Like Maybe I Didn't
Know Myself After All,

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:58.096
And I Honestly Felt Like
I Wasn't Even Part Of My Family.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.233
Focus, Focus, Focus,
Focus, Focus, Focus.

01:02:01.267 --> 01:02:02.968
Good Morning, Jamie.

01:02:03.002 --> 01:02:04.035
What's Goin' On?

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:06.304
Nothing.
I'm Late.

01:02:06.339 --> 01:02:08.306
Ok, Ok, Before We Do
The Card Thing,

01:02:08.341 --> 01:02:10.976
Did You Hear The One About The
Eskimo Who Died Of Cold Cuts?

01:02:12.111 --> 01:02:14.012
He Stabbed Himself
With An Icicle.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.113
Ha Ha Ha.
Ha Ha.

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.582
I Appreciate
The Effort, Guys,

01:02:17.617 --> 01:02:18.750
But Can We Just
Get This Over With?

01:02:18.785 --> 01:02:21.019
Ok.

01:02:21.053 --> 01:02:24.055
We Want As!

01:02:24.957 --> 01:02:26.691
Straight As, Brad?

01:02:26.726 --> 01:02:27.726
You're Boring.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.528
Uh, Look At You,
Jamie.

01:02:29.562 --> 01:02:30.996
I See An "A."

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.531
It's Just
In Art Class.

01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:35.300
Well, It's An "A"
And No Cs?

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.103
It's Your Best
Report Card Ever.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.439
You Taking Smart Pills?

01:02:40.473 --> 01:02:43.041
I Was Just
Having Fun, You Know?

01:02:46.446 --> 01:02:48.847
Give Your Parents
Another Chance, Jamie.

01:02:48.881 --> 01:02:49.981
I Think You All
Know By Now

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:52.217
Is That It's All In How You See It, Right?

01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:53.552
I Mean,
What Would Have Happened Here...

01:02:53.586 --> 01:02:54.619
If Picasso
Had Been Told--

01:02:54.654 --> 01:02:56.354
Excuse Me, Mr. Blackmer.

01:02:56.389 --> 01:02:59.458
Start Drawing The Cubes.
Start From The Left.

01:03:01.627 --> 01:03:02.694
Huh?

01:03:08.501 --> 01:03:12.771
Everything's Fine,
But There's Something You Need To Know.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.241
Obviously,
Everything Wasn't Fine.

01:03:32.859 --> 01:03:34.526
Is He Ok?
Is He Ok?

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.061
He's Fine.
He's Fine.

01:03:36.095 --> 01:03:37.128
What Happened?

01:03:37.163 --> 01:03:38.530
His Temperature
Just Shot Up.

01:03:38.564 --> 01:03:41.199
He Was So Hot,
But He's Ok. He's--

01:03:43.469 --> 01:03:46.137
It's Ok, Honey.
He's Gonna Be Fine.

01:03:46.172 --> 01:03:48.306
He Just--
He Looks So Helpless.

01:03:48.341 --> 01:03:51.743
He's A Baby.
He Is Helpless.

01:03:52.645 --> 01:03:53.912
I'm Scared.

01:03:53.946 --> 01:03:56.615
Honey, You Don't
Have To Be Scared Now.

01:03:56.649 --> 01:03:59.885
No, Not Just For Him.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:04.055
I'm Scared That Things
Are Ruined Between Us.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.423
Well, That's
Not Possible.

01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:07.459
We Are Always
Here For You.

01:04:07.493 --> 01:04:10.762
Absolutely,
Jamie, Always.

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:13.565
You Know How
You Kept Telling Us

01:04:13.599 --> 01:04:16.101
The Quints Were
5 Different People?

01:04:16.135 --> 01:04:18.169
Well, I Heard You,
But...

01:04:18.204 --> 01:04:19.704
I Didn't Understand.

01:04:19.739 --> 01:04:21.239
They Seemed Like
A Unit, You Know?

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:22.908
I Could
Plan For One. I--

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.110
Honey, I Just
Couldn't Plan For 5.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.713
And Then, Dashing
To The Hospital Today...

01:04:29.749 --> 01:04:31.716
It Wasn't The Quints
Who Were Sick.

01:04:31.751 --> 01:04:33.251
It Was Adam.

01:04:34.186 --> 01:04:35.353
Sweet Little Adam.

01:04:36.322 --> 01:04:38.723
Yeah,
Sweet Little Adam.

01:04:39.825 --> 01:04:42.694
That's One Poor, Sick,
Little Baby Boy.

01:04:43.729 --> 01:04:45.897
I'm My Own Person, Too,
You Know?

01:04:45.932 --> 01:04:47.232
Of Course You Are,
Honey.

01:04:47.266 --> 01:04:49.534
No, I Mean...

01:04:49.569 --> 01:04:52.771
I'm Not Really Sure If
I Want The Same Things

01:04:52.805 --> 01:04:54.573
That You Want For Me.

01:04:54.607 --> 01:04:56.875
You Don't Want
To Go To College?

01:04:56.909 --> 01:05:00.579
Maybe. Probably.

01:05:00.613 --> 01:05:03.014
I Just-- I Want To Find My Own Way.

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:07.185
I Don't Want To Follow
Your Plan, Dad.

01:05:07.219 --> 01:05:09.120
I Want My Own.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:12.958
I Only Wanted
What Was Best For Ya.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:14.125
Me, Too.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.694
That's Why
We Try So Hard.

01:05:15.728 --> 01:05:17.629
I Know That.

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:21.366
It's Just,
I May Never Be A Straight-A Student...

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.401
Certainly Not
A Science-Fair Whiz,

01:05:23.436 --> 01:05:26.104
But, Um...

01:05:27.039 --> 01:05:29.274
I Guess With Art...

01:05:29.308 --> 01:05:32.510
I Finally Found Something That Makes Me Happy.

01:05:34.213 --> 01:05:37.215
I'm Working
Really Hard At It.

01:05:37.249 --> 01:05:39.918
Can't That Be Enough?

01:05:42.488 --> 01:05:46.257
Oh, Honey,
It's More Than Enough.

01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:49.728
Honey, We Only Wanted These
Things That We Wanted For You

01:05:49.762 --> 01:05:52.364
Because We Wanted You
To Be Happy.

01:05:52.398 --> 01:05:54.132
That's--

01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:57.002
Jamie, That's The Only Point Of The Plan.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:58.837
Look At You.

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:01.706
You Figured It Out
On Your Own.

01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:04.909
I Found Myself.

01:06:04.944 --> 01:06:06.578
I Found Me.

01:06:11.584 --> 01:06:13.618
Who Made You So Smart?

01:06:13.653 --> 01:06:15.286
I Don't Know.

01:06:15.321 --> 01:06:17.389
I Don't Know.
You Guys, I Guess.

01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:23.261
I Came As Soon As I Heard.

01:06:23.295 --> 01:06:24.562
Everything's Fine.

01:06:24.597 --> 01:06:25.997
Ohh, Great.

01:06:26.032 --> 01:06:28.466
You Know I Knew That It Would
Be Adam Who Got Into Trouble.

01:06:28.501 --> 01:06:30.635
Little Boys Always
Make Me Nervous.

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:33.405
So, Tell Me, How Long's
He Gonna Be Out For?

01:06:34.373 --> 01:06:35.573
A Week, Maybe 2.

01:06:35.608 --> 01:06:39.077
Oh, No, No, No, No.
This Is Bad. We Have Gigs.

01:06:39.111 --> 01:06:41.112
Oh, Well,
I'll Tell His Doctors.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.748
Can't We Postpone?

01:06:43.783 --> 01:06:46.951
No. No. That Doesn't
Make Us Look Good.

01:06:46.986 --> 01:06:48.553
The World Wants
Healthy Babies.

01:06:48.587 --> 01:06:51.556
I Wonder...

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:52.490
How Old Is He?

01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:55.326
The Same Age As They All Are, Albert.

01:06:55.361 --> 01:06:56.361
5 Months.

01:06:56.395 --> 01:06:57.862
Oh, Yeah.

01:06:57.897 --> 01:06:59.197
Ok,
Go With Me On This.

01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:01.099
We Find Another
Matching Baby

01:07:01.133 --> 01:07:04.169
Just For This Week. Same Size...
No One Will Know The Difference, Right?

01:07:04.203 --> 01:07:07.272
Oh, Albert, Maybe
I Can Substitute.

01:07:07.306 --> 01:07:09.908
It's All About The Quints.
You Can't Be Part Of The Picture.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.779
No, Albert, You Can't Be
Part Of The Picture.

01:07:17.183 --> 01:07:18.883
You're Fired.

01:07:18.918 --> 01:07:22.153
What--

01:07:22.188 --> 01:07:23.688
You Must Be Kidding, Jim.
I Saved You.

01:07:23.723 --> 01:07:25.356
Yeah, And You've Been
Well Paid For It.

01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:26.691
Now Just... Go Away.

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.095
Nancy, Please,
Tell Him This Is A Mistake.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.196
I Mean...

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:37.335
You've Overstayed
Your Welcome, Albert.

01:07:41.273 --> 01:07:42.273
What--

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.642
Ok, Fine, Fine.
We Won't Replace Adam.

01:07:44.677 --> 01:07:45.610
You'll Lose Business, But--

01:07:45.644 --> 01:07:48.079
But At Least
We'll Have Our Family.

01:07:49.281 --> 01:07:51.683
Good-Bye, Albert.

01:07:56.388 --> 01:07:57.756
Weird, Huh?

01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:59.524
It Should Have Been
A Terrible Day,

01:07:59.558 --> 01:08:03.828
But, Suddenly, I Felt Better
Than I Had In A Long Time.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.900
1, 2, 3 And...

01:08:08.934 --> 01:08:11.102
I Never Mentioned
The Art Show Again.

01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:13.505
I Decided That
Helping Out My Parents

01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:15.607
Was More Important
Than Being With My Art.

01:08:15.641 --> 01:08:17.175
Art Would Always Be Around,

01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:19.810
But My Parents Might Never
Be Parents Of The Year Again.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.846
So I Agreed To Baby-Sit
The Quints With Brad And Zoe

01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:25.617
While The Folks
Went To Get Their Award.

01:08:25.651 --> 01:08:27.352
Thank You.
Thank You Very Much.

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:31.288
Whoa!
Grovers Looking Sharp.

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:33.224
Thank You.
Thank You Very Much.

01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:34.859
Ok, You Guys
Gonna Be All Right?

01:08:34.894 --> 01:08:35.926
Yes,
Of Course.

01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:37.028
I Love You.
Call Us If You Need Anything.

01:08:37.062 --> 01:08:38.229
I'm So
Excited.

01:08:38.264 --> 01:08:39.898
Good-Bye.
Ok, Honey. Thanks.

01:08:39.932 --> 01:08:41.566
Ok, Good-Bye.
Don't Let Him Touch Your Stuff.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.268
Ok, Bye.

01:08:43.301 --> 01:08:44.269
Have Fun, Guys.

01:08:44.303 --> 01:08:46.738
All Right,
Thank You.

01:08:53.612 --> 01:08:56.046
Whoo-Hoo!
Whoo-Hoo, Yes!

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:01.986
Governor Healy,
The Grovers Are Here.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.188
Oh, Ooh.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:07.192
Ahh, The Grovers.
What A Pleasure.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:08.960
This Is Such
A Big Night.

01:09:08.993 --> 01:09:11.629
We've Got Press Here From Every Paper In The State.

01:09:11.663 --> 01:09:12.964
It's Really
Remarkable.

01:09:12.997 --> 01:09:15.099
Oh, Well,
It's Really An Honor For Us, Sir, Really.

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:17.635
And Your Adorable Quintuplets Are Where, Exactly?

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:20.238
At Home,
All Snug And Warm.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.541
That's Very Funny.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.076
You're Making Jokes
With The Governor.

01:09:26.812 --> 01:09:28.546
But Where Are They,
Really?

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.381
5 Minutes
After My Parents Left,

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.951
I Noticed That They Had
Forgotten A Small Detail,

01:09:32.984 --> 01:09:34.853
Well, 5 Small Details.

01:09:34.886 --> 01:09:36.554
They Were Gonna Look
Really Bad.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:37.822
I Couldn't Let That Happen.

01:09:37.857 --> 01:09:39.256
Yes, Well, You Know How
My Mom's Always Been

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:40.658
A Little Bit
Scatterbrained?

01:09:40.693 --> 01:09:42.260
She Scattered
Way Too Much This Time.

01:09:42.294 --> 01:09:44.462
She And Dad Were Supposed To
Bring The Quints To The Dinner.

01:09:44.496 --> 01:09:47.131
Ok, Ok,
Quint Rescue Duty Better Finish Quickly.

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:48.466
I Cannot Miss
The Art Show, Jamie.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.635
Ok, Checklist.
5 Babies?

01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:52.103
5? There's
5 Of Them?

01:09:53.171 --> 01:09:54.272
Kidding. Check.

01:09:54.306 --> 01:09:55.607
Ah, Ha.
Very Funny.

01:09:55.641 --> 01:09:56.808
Ok, Car Seats?

01:09:56.842 --> 01:09:57.775
Check.

01:09:57.810 --> 01:09:59.143
Great. Uh,
Cash And Directions?

01:10:01.213 --> 01:10:03.181
Oh, Sorry.
That Was Mine.

01:10:03.215 --> 01:10:04.115
Let's Hit The Road.

01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:05.783
All Right, Let's Go.

01:10:08.187 --> 01:10:09.754
But--But I Don't Understand.

01:10:09.788 --> 01:10:11.556
I Was Told All 7 Of You
Would Be Here.

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:13.124
I Am So Sorry.

01:10:13.158 --> 01:10:14.993
Uh...

01:10:15.027 --> 01:10:17.996
Uh, It's Ok.
Not A Problem.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:21.065
I'm The Governor.
I Can Handle This.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.535
I'll Send The State Troopers
To Pick Up Those Little Ones.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.942
Get Those Quints
Ready For Transit.

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:32.710
Crisis Averted.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:41.586
Hey,
We Almost Made It.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.156
And That Means My Parents
Are Almost Off The Hook.

01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.391
I Think You Need Oil.

01:10:46.425 --> 01:10:47.892
Hypothetically,
I Think You're Right.

01:10:47.927 --> 01:10:50.128
I Guess It's Over.

01:10:50.162 --> 01:10:51.596
Maybe The Tow Truck Can Take
You Back To The Art Show...

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:53.264
If It Ever Shows Up.

01:10:53.299 --> 01:10:59.070
Jamie, Jamie...
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

01:10:59.104 --> 01:11:02.573
Never Give Up,
Particularly If There's Something You Believe In.

01:11:02.608 --> 01:11:04.742
Come On,
Do You Believe In Your Family?

01:11:04.777 --> 01:11:05.810
In The Quints?

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:07.312
Yourself?

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:08.546
Yeah.

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.982
Well, Then Make
A Plan, Man.

01:11:15.054 --> 01:11:15.987
Good Luck.

01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:17.322
Bye.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.358
Careful, Guys,
Good Luck. Bye.

It's Only 2 Stops
To The State House.

01:11:31.403 --> 01:11:33.037
We Do This Every Year
On Our School Trips, Zoe.

01:11:33.072 --> 01:11:34.105
Grow Up.

01:11:34.139 --> 01:11:35.740

Let's Do It Quick.

01:11:35.774 --> 01:11:37.909
My Arms
Are Falling Off.

01:11:37.943 --> 01:11:41.980
Not Home? Not Home?
But Me And Those Quints

01:11:42.014 --> 01:11:44.082
Were Gonna Be On
The Front Page Together.

01:11:44.116 --> 01:11:45.483

Thing That Happened

01:11:45.517 --> 01:11:49.153

With The Backstreet Guys.

It's Ok.
I Can Handle This.

01:11:52.424 --> 01:11:53.624
Oh, Good News, I Hope.

01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:55.426
I Spoke To Our Neighbor,
Who Talked To Her Cousin,

01:11:55.461 --> 01:11:58.296
Who Talked To A Coworker,
Who Said They're On Their Way.

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:00.965
On Their Way?
On Their Way?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.235
They Should Have Been Here Hours Ago With You!

01:12:04.269 --> 01:12:06.170
I'm So Sorry.

01:12:06.205 --> 01:12:09.774
I Just Get So Excited...
Meeting The Quints.

01:12:09.808 --> 01:12:13.678
That's No Way To Speak To My Parents Of The Year,
Is It?

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.814
Oh, It's No Use.

01:12:16.849 --> 01:12:19.484

Written All Over It.

01:12:19.518 --> 01:12:23.087

I'll Say.

01:12:46.478 --> 01:12:48.346
How Could We Not Have Known
To Bring The Quints?

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.480
I'm Gonna Tell You.

01:12:49.515 --> 01:12:50.581
Planning Is Just Too Hard With This Many Kids.

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:51.816
I Give Up.

01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:53.985
Ladies And Gentlemen,
Governor Thomas Healy.

01:12:54.019 --> 01:12:57.221
There's No More Big Plan.
I Quit. No More.

01:13:03.028 --> 01:13:04.629
Mr. Governor,
Sir!

01:13:07.499 --> 01:13:09.133
We Just Want
To Apologize.

01:13:09.168 --> 01:13:12.236
Months Of Planning,
No Babies.

01:13:12.271 --> 01:13:13.871
The Perfect Moment
Gone.

01:13:15.074 --> 01:13:16.974
I Just Wanted A Few
Pictures Taken.

01:13:17.009 --> 01:13:20.778
We Are So Sorry,
Mr. Governor... Sir.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:23.414
Out Of The Way.
Out Of The Way!

01:13:23.449 --> 01:13:26.517
Out Of The Way!
Aw, Hands Off! Stand Back!

01:13:26.552 --> 01:13:30.321
Little Guy,
The Grovers Are Here!

01:13:30.355 --> 01:13:31.622
Adam...

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.092
And A Big Biker Guy.
Heh.

01:13:34.126 --> 01:13:35.226
Hi, Guys.

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.128
Hey, Honey.

01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:38.830
Here's Your Quints.
They're Pretty Adorable, You Know.

01:13:38.864 --> 01:13:40.698
Yeah, We Know.

01:13:40.732 --> 01:13:42.233
Nice To Meet You,
Little Man.

01:13:42.267 --> 01:13:44.168
I Told You This Would
Work Out Fine.

01:13:44.203 --> 01:13:46.370
You Panic Far Too Easily.

01:13:46.405 --> 01:13:49.974
Hey, Hey... Hey,
Where Have You Been?

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:51.142
Hey, Uh--

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:53.544
Wait, Um...
You. Here You Go.

01:13:53.579 --> 01:13:55.313
That's All Right. He's A Good Guy.
He's A Good Guy.

01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:56.481
He's Dressed
Like A Monkey.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:58.015
Here We Go.
Come On. Come On.

01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:59.717
Take Him.

01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:02.153
Aw, Thank You. Ok.
Here You Go.

01:14:03.322 --> 01:14:04.222
Thanks, Guys.

01:14:04.256 --> 01:14:05.656
Couldn't Have
Done It Without You.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.492
Not A Problem.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.594
Uh, Honey, You Gonna
Join Us For Dinner?

01:14:09.628 --> 01:14:11.829
No, Thanks.
I'm Not Really Dressed.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:14.298
I'll Have My Driver Take You Back Home,
If You Like.

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.900
He Can Take You
Anywhere, Actually.

01:14:15.934 --> 01:14:16.901
Anywhere?

01:14:16.935 --> 01:14:18.269
Sure, Anywhere.

01:14:20.305 --> 01:14:23.341
Come On, Guys. Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad. Have Fun. Bye.

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:24.942
Yeah, Ho, Hey, Young Lady,
Where You Goin'?

01:14:24.977 --> 01:14:27.078
Hello? Ohh.

01:14:27.112 --> 01:14:29.180
I Just Don't
Understand That Kid.

01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:31.849
Teenagers Are Just
Plain Weird.

01:14:32.918 --> 01:14:35.186
That Was Off The Record,
Of Course.

01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:36.821
With The Crisis Solved,

01:14:36.855 --> 01:14:39.357
I Let The Governor's Driver
Take Us Out For Ice Cream.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:41.392
I Mean, Where Else
Would I Go?

01:14:41.426 --> 01:14:43.394
Nowhere, Right?

01:14:43.428 --> 01:14:45.897
Ok... You Caught Me.

01:14:45.931 --> 01:14:47.165
The Truth Is,

01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:49.033
I Had The Driver
Race Us To The Art Show.

01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:51.202
I Got There Just In Time.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.909
How In The World...

01:14:57.943 --> 01:15:00.745
Bus, Subway, Bikers,
And A Limo. You?

01:15:00.779 --> 01:15:03.814
Tow Truck
And Walking Shoes.

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:08.286
Actually, The Artist
Is Here Now.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.154
This Is
Jamie Grover.

01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:13.224
These Are Sketches Of Her Brothers And Sisters.

01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:17.228
And Then It Was Time
For The Big Moment.

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:20.898
And Now, It's Time
For The Big Moment.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.267
He Needs A New Writer,
Don't You Think?

01:15:23.302 --> 01:15:26.504
Ahem. Each Year,
One Student

01:15:26.538 --> 01:15:29.073
Is Recognized For His
Or Her Body Of Work

01:15:29.107 --> 01:15:31.042
Entered In The School
Art Show.

01:15:31.076 --> 01:15:33.044
This Is A Student

01:15:33.078 --> 01:15:35.513
That The Judges Feel
Has A Special Gift.

01:15:35.547 --> 01:15:38.416
As Always, This Is A Very
Difficult Decision To Make,

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:42.019
As Many Of You Out There
Have Extraordinary Talent.

01:15:42.054 --> 01:15:45.056
But Still,
We Do Make A Decision.

01:15:45.090 --> 01:15:48.960
And This Year,
The Blue Ribbon Goes To...

01:15:48.994 --> 01:15:51.762
Jamie Grover!

01:15:53.265 --> 01:15:56.434
Guess What.
I'm Not Fooling You.

01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:58.069
This Is What
Really Happened!

01:15:58.103 --> 01:15:59.437
It Was Pretty Awesome.

01:15:59.471 --> 01:16:01.072
Congratulations,
Jamie!

01:16:02.941 --> 01:16:04.442
I Knew
You Could Do It.

01:16:04.476 --> 01:16:06.010
I'm Very Proud
Of You.

01:16:06.044 --> 01:16:08.646
Congratulations,
Jamie.

Whoa, Whoa, Wait.

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:27.832
That Part Didn't Happen.

01:16:29.067 --> 01:16:32.003
But Guess What Did.

01:16:33.171 --> 01:16:35.640
Hey, Hey!
That's My Girl!

01:16:37.142 --> 01:16:38.576
Oh, Honey!

01:16:43.615 --> 01:16:46.050
What Are You Guys
Doing Here?

01:16:46.084 --> 01:16:48.152
Well, About A Moment
After You Left,

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:50.755
We Suddenly Realized Exactly Where You Were Going.

01:16:50.789 --> 01:16:52.757
You Remembered?

01:16:52.791 --> 01:16:54.959
Yes, We Remembered,
And We Felt Like Terrible People

01:16:54.993 --> 01:16:57.595
That We Forgot Even For That One Little Moment.

01:16:57.629 --> 01:17:00.498
So I Said To The Governor,
If We're Parents Of The Year,

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:02.667
There's Only One Place
We Can Be.

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:05.102
Our Children Come First.

01:17:05.137 --> 01:17:09.206
And I Said, "Well, I May Not Know Much About Art,
But I Know What I Like.

01:17:09.241 --> 01:17:10.941
Let's Go!"
So Here We Are.

01:17:10.976 --> 01:17:14.011
Wait, What About The Dinner And The Award?

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.946
This Is Better.

01:17:15.981 --> 01:17:17.481
Much Better.

01:17:26.692 --> 01:17:29.460
You Want To Hear
Something Funny?

01:17:29.494 --> 01:17:31.162
I Ended Up Getting
A Few Good Grades,

01:17:31.196 --> 01:17:33.798
And Mr. Blackmer Wrote Me
A Great Recommendation Letter,

01:17:33.832 --> 01:17:38.202
And Poof--I Was Eligible For George
Washington Science Magnet School.

01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:40.004
But I Said No, Thanks.

01:17:40.038 --> 01:17:42.206
Mom And Dad Said
It Didn't Matter Anymore.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.076
After All, Life Is
Always What You Make It.

01:17:49.214 --> 01:17:52.516
So... I Moved On
To The Ninth Grade.

01:17:52.551 --> 01:17:54.452
My Grades Stayed
About The Same,

01:17:54.519 --> 01:17:56.420
But My Art Got Better
And Better,

01:17:56.455 --> 01:17:59.056
Thanks To My Hard Work
And Mr. Blackmer's Teaching.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:01.992
Best Of All, I Was Happy.

01:18:02.027 --> 01:18:04.795
Well, As Happy
As 14-Year-Old Girls Ever Get,

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:07.531
But That's A Different Story.

01:18:07.566 --> 01:18:10.835
Dad Got A Promotion,
But He's Still Trying To Make Himself Better,

01:18:10.869 --> 01:18:12.636
Still Hitting Those Books.

01:18:12.671 --> 01:18:14.972
Mom Continued To Manage
The Quints' Career,

01:18:15.006 --> 01:18:17.174
But She Scaled Their Work
Way Back.

01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:19.210
It's Going Well Enough
That We Can All Eat

01:18:19.244 --> 01:18:21.445
But Not So Good
That Dad's Quitting His Job.

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.014
Oh!
And There Was One Other Bit Of News.

01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:32.857
The Doctors Say
It's Septuplets!

01:18:32.891 --> 01:18:34.992
That's 7!

01:18:36.895 --> 01:18:38.496
Oh, Come On Now, People.

01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:41.332
Haven't I Taught You
Anything?
