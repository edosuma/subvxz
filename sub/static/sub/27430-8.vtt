00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
-Ah!
- She looks excited!

00:08.008 --> 00:11.052
I'm so excited because I love mess.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.347
It's a never ending battle
to fight the clutter.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.349
-Oh!

00:16.433 --> 00:19.019
I want things to be more simple.
I don't know how to fix it.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
With the baby coming,
it's gonna be more chaos.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.567
Oh, my God! We have too much stuff!

00:26.109 --> 00:28.028
Hello, I'm Marie Kondo.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.279
My mission

00:29.362 --> 00:32.741
is to spark joy in the world
through cleaning.

00:33.116 --> 00:33.950
Ching!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
<i>Best-selling author</i>
<i>and world-renowned tidying expert</i>

00:37.078 --> 00:41.583
<i>Marie Kondo is dedicated to inspiring</i>
<i>the world to choose joy</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:43.334
<i>with the KonMari Method.</i>

00:43.501 --> 00:45.253
A feature of the KonMari Method

00:45.336 --> 00:48.214
<i>is that you clean by item</i>
<i>and not by location.</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:51.718
And we will always clean using
the same categories.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.386
First, it's clothing.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
I can't reach.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.849
Next, is books.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.852
Giving them a little shake
and wake them up.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
Then, paper.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.439
I can't do the papers.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.027
The largest category is <i>komono.</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:12.614
<i>Komono </i>is kitchen, bathroom,

01:12.697 --> 01:13.740
and garage.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.868
Everything miscellaneous.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.163
Finally, sentimental items.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.999
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.212
This is kinda hard.

01:27.295 --> 01:30.131
I don't want to just, you know, dump it.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.093
But I want to be thoughtful about it.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.554
<i>From the moment she</i>
<i>set foot in our house,</i>

01:36.679 --> 01:38.473
<i>she had this presence to her.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:40.767
She wants to see this place turned around.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.895
Marie brought a whole bunch
of joy upon our home.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
This is amazing.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440
You're so cute! I love you!

01:47.524 --> 01:49.734
You're so cute.
I love you, too.
These are, like, happy, happy tears.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.197
Thank you for what you've brought
to our home, really.

02:00.286 --> 02:04.249
The KonMari Method
is a means to realize your ideal life.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.961
My clients this time, Angela and Alishia,
are newlyweds.

02:08.169 --> 02:12.632
They recently purchased a condo
for their new home.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.676
They are a lovely couple,

02:14.759 --> 02:19.305
but they are having trouble figuring out
how they can turn their new home

02:19.389 --> 02:21.307
into a comfortable space for both of them.

02:21.599 --> 02:27.981
Through tidying, I'm looking forward to
helping them create a comfortable home.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.538
-Hi!
-Hi.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.748
-Hello, I'm Marie.
-Angela.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.750
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.504
-Hi, I'm Iida, Miss Marie's interpreter.
-Hi Iida. Nice to meet you. Angela.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.382
-We're very excited to have you here.
-Yes!

02:54.465 --> 02:56.301
-Alright, come on in.
-Thank you.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.345
We do have a kitty cat.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.933
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.185
Hi, Kitty!

03:05.351 --> 03:08.563
-Nice to meet you. I'm Marie.
- Alishia.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.106
Pleased to meet you.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.401
-Hi, I'm Iida, Miss Marie's interpreter.
-Nice to meet you, Iida. Alishia.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.030
- Oh, you have two dogs!
-Our puppies out there.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.991
So the big one is London
and the little one is Teddy,

03:20.074 --> 03:22.202
and you've met kitten, Earl.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.332
I'm Angela, I'm a veterinarian.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.584
I'm Alishia, I'm a flight attendant.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.253
I was working a flight from...

03:32.837 --> 03:33.755
Vegas to Atlanta,

03:33.838 --> 03:36.466
and she was my passenger and she was all
like, "Hey, cute stuff."

03:36.549 --> 03:39.093
-I was like, "Hey, girl."
-That's not how I remember it.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.804
Oh, my gosh, really?
I mean, it's close enough.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.973
-That was, what, five years ago?
-Mm-hmm.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.851
<i>Prior to Angela</i>
<i>I was considered a nomad.</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:49.103
<i>I feel like I literally grabbed her</i>
<i>out of the sky and...</i>

03:49.729 --> 03:50.855
brought her down to earth.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.106
Oh, yes.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.360
<i>We recently just got married last June.</i>

03:55.443 --> 03:58.655
<i>-We've literally married...</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Married our lives together.</i>

03:58.738 --> 04:00.907
So, we are new homeowners.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.494
About a month ago,
we've closed escrow on our new place.

04:04.577 --> 04:08.706
So, this is that first step
into adulthood that we're--

04:08.790 --> 04:11.334
we've heard so much about.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.670
<i>Just in these last couple of weeks,</i>

04:13.753 --> 04:16.256
<i>we've been moving</i>
<i>and things are everywhere.</i>

04:16.339 --> 04:19.342
<i>The transition has been semi-stressful.</i>

04:19.425 --> 04:21.052
-You know, it's--
-Very stressful.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.845
Okay. Very stressful.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.392
<i>That's why it's critical</i>
<i>for us to get our space</i>

04:27.475 --> 04:29.519
<i>organized and live-in ready,</i>

04:29.602 --> 04:31.729
<i>because it's a new chapter.</i>

04:31.813 --> 04:33.439
You don't want to start
the new chapter...

04:33.898 --> 04:36.401
-disorganized or chaotic.
-With old stuff.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.111
We want that easy breezy.

04:38.194 --> 04:41.197
We want to be able to come into our space
and definitely feel...

04:41.656 --> 04:43.574
relaxed, you know?

04:47.161 --> 04:49.497
So how long has it been
since you moved here?

04:49.580 --> 04:50.957
Uh, It's only been three weeks.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.333
-We just moved here.
-Three weeks?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.251
Yes.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.796
-Gosh, so you just moved in.
-Yes.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.631
- Wow.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.842
So, as soon as I entered this room,
it seems perfectly organized and tidy.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.680
Is, is--
Do you really have a problem with tidying?

05:05.763 --> 05:08.016
-Oh, you'll see.
-Should we give you a little tour?

05:08.099 --> 05:09.225
Yes, please.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.644
-♪ <i>The struggle ♪</i>

05:11.894 --> 05:14.147
We call this the struggle room.

05:14.897 --> 05:18.192
- I see. I'm starting to see now.
- The good stuff. Yeah.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.819
Ninety percent of those are mine.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.865
Those are mostly mine.

05:24.407 --> 05:25.992
Here are the shoes.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.744
-Clothes.
- Clothes.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.830
-Mostly mine. Well...

05:30.913 --> 05:33.124
Mine. Mine, mine.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.084
Ours, more winter stuff.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.671
-So how do you use this room right now?

05:38.755 --> 05:39.964
-We don't.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.091
We want this room to be
kinda like the office

05:42.175 --> 05:45.345
slash guest space, slash closet.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.892
Yes, there's a lot of cloudiness
here in this room.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.019
So we'll figure that out.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.188
- Don't fall on anything.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.940
We tried to organize
this space a little bit.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.695
So how do you use this space?

06:03.279 --> 06:05.573
My pants and then...

06:06.074 --> 06:08.659
-Those are my jeans on that side.
-Yeah.

06:08.743 --> 06:14.040
<i>Usually, we find ourselves</i>
<i>in a closet battle.</i>

06:14.123 --> 06:18.419
For instance, we share belts, like belts
and socks and accessories and things.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.421
I'll ask her where the belts are,

06:20.505 --> 06:22.673
'cause my belts that she doesn't wear
are in a spot,

06:22.757 --> 06:25.093
so we have, like, separate belts
and we have belts together.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.220
-The belts together get lost.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.348
<i>Although we've been together</i>
<i>for so many years,</i>

06:30.431 --> 06:32.183
<i>we never got to organize.</i>

06:32.308 --> 06:35.520
We're gonna have clothes in both rooms.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.730
You wanna put your shirt on over there,
pants over here.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.940
How do you want this to work?

06:39.023 --> 06:41.901
I've kinda just been grabbing
the outfit together.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.904
Like, I grab a shirt, come in here
and grab some pants,

06:44.987 --> 06:46.948
and get dressed in the room.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.951
-I'm just saying, you don't want...
-Some cohesiveness?

06:50.034 --> 06:51.702
-Yeah.
-I do, but I just...

06:51.953 --> 06:53.830
I just want everything put away right now.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.041
-It causes tension.
-It causes tension.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.256
So the general impression
that I got from your closet is that

07:03.339 --> 07:05.591
a lot of your things are mixed together

07:05.675 --> 07:09.512
and it's a little difficult
to determine, oh, what's inside.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.264
-Yeah.
-Yes.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.348
Yes.

07:15.810 --> 07:20.523
A tip on sharing
closet space with a partner

07:20.815 --> 07:24.444
is to designate areas for each person.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.945
For example,

07:26.237 --> 07:27.613
in this closet...

07:29.031 --> 07:31.159
I can't reach the top rack,

07:31.242 --> 07:36.372
so I will choose to use the bottom rack.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.040
By doing this,

07:38.124 --> 07:44.839
it is easy to see
how much clothing you have.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.008
Aw.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.135
This is kind of
our stress-free area.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.012
We wanted to ensure we had
a place in the house

07:51.095 --> 07:55.183
to kinda get away from all of the moving,
and so we put this together first.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.143
Okay.

07:57.894 --> 07:58.853
You got it?

07:58.936 --> 08:01.856
So this is the only part
where it's kind of like hers and mine.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.524
Yeah, clothes are mine.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.444
I feel like we organize things
a little differently,

08:06.527 --> 08:08.571
like, she will put things
in a different spot than me,

08:08.654 --> 08:11.741
and I think that's how we get
kind of our wires crossed.

08:13.701 --> 08:17.038
I would recommend making
this particular closet

08:17.121 --> 08:18.164
all of Alishia's clothes.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.834
And then that way Angela
could have the guest bedroom space.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.132
Ultimately, that would be
the simplest solution.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.342
- Goody.
-Okay.

08:29.425 --> 08:35.556
When tidying,
each individual should be responsible

08:35.640 --> 08:37.350
for their own space.

08:37.433 --> 08:42.230
This lessens the tension

08:42.313 --> 08:44.690
and increases their sense of trust
and bonding.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.109
The kitchen. It could be better.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.031
This has room
for improvement definitely.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.658
That's actually a problem area.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.826
So do these items belong
to the both of you,

08:55.910 --> 08:58.037
or does one person
have more than the other?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.288
I would say maybe both.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.790
The kitchen was kinda split.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.792
-Yeah.
-Half is mine, half is hers.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.294
We're definitely complete opposites

09:05.378 --> 09:07.421
when it comes to, like, organizing.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.006
And it's frustrating.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.593
We need help categorizing what stuff
needs to go with what stuff.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.181
I really feel that the presence
of this home is so important.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.934
You mentioned that this is your first home
that you've purchased,

09:20.017 --> 09:22.186
so this is a very significant space.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.272
So I would like to take this time

09:24.355 --> 09:27.441
to formally introduce myself to your home.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.734
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.530
It's only been three weeks, right?

09:32.613 --> 09:33.489
-Yup.
-Yes.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.202
If that's the case,

09:38.452 --> 09:41.581
I think it would be much better
if you do this with me.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.374
-Okay.
-Okay, let's do it.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.459
Let's gather here in the middle.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.343
Just tell your home
your intention for it

09:54.802 --> 09:56.345
and your hopes for it.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.691
She'll meditate for a while.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.402
You guys left me.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.367
How did you feel?

10:59.450 --> 11:01.243
-Inspired.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.328
Excited.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.705
- Yeah.
- I just saw order.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.082
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.458
Relaxed.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.629
I hope you'll keep
all the feelings that you felt

11:11.712 --> 11:13.506
in your heart
as we go through the tidying,

11:13.589 --> 11:16.133
because tidying isn't just about
organizing your home.

11:16.217 --> 11:21.263
It's about creating a welcoming, inviting,
positive environment into your home.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.265
Yay!

11:27.019 --> 11:29.814
Take out every single,
last piece of clothes.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.191
Oh, lordy, help me!

11:33.693 --> 11:36.654
-What's your anxiety level right now?

11:37.279 --> 11:39.240
We're gonna lose Marie in the pile.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.242
Holy macaroni.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.369
I told you you have
more clothes than me.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.287
I know I have more clothes than you.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.331
I think we have it all.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.918
We're gonna be going through
these clothes piece be piece.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.795
When you hold each item in your hands,

11:52.878 --> 11:55.381
ask if it sparks joy for you.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.425
Okay. I can do that.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.385
We can just start right from the top.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.470
Yes.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.013
Yes, yes.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.390
Yes, yes, yes.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.476
And all of these yeses.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.357
Angela, let's get started
with your pile, then.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.984
-Okay.
-Oh, Okay.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.236
<i>Clothes for me</i>
<i>are just functional</i>

12:17.319 --> 12:20.281
<i>because I'm not very attached</i>
<i>to material things.</i>

12:20.364 --> 12:22.533
So I don't have very
many clothes in general

12:22.616 --> 12:25.327
just because I'm wearing scrubs
four days out of the week.

12:25.411 --> 12:28.914
I don't have dresses and shirts
and pants and stuff like that.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.666
I don't like to get dressed up too much.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.045
Ask if it sparks joy for you.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.132
I like it, but I really--
I don't wear it as often.

12:38.215 --> 12:41.802
I can let you go.
You can be happy for somebody else.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.596
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:43.679 --> 12:44.847
She let the Redskins go?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.766
Get out of my space!

12:48.851 --> 12:49.769
Goodness.

12:51.729 --> 12:56.358
I pride myself
on my eclecticness

12:56.442 --> 12:57.943
because I do wear a uniform,

12:58.027 --> 13:00.780
and so, I don't really get to wear
my clothes too much,

13:00.863 --> 13:02.948
and I feel like
even though I'm not wearing

13:03.032 --> 13:04.158
the clothes all the time

13:04.241 --> 13:07.578
it's still, like, an expression
of my personality.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.330
Right, how are we doing?

13:09.413 --> 13:12.458
Question: there's some things
that I'm holding onto.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.044
There's one dress in particular
I wanted to show you.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.130
This is actually the little dress.
My grandmother bought me this.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.089
Ah! I love.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.760
Isn't it so cute?

13:23.093 --> 13:25.846
- I love it, it's lovely.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.681
But it's also too small, so...

13:29.225 --> 13:30.392
I just remember...

13:31.477 --> 13:35.147
wanting it really bad,
and she kinda gave me that look.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.565
She was like, "Go try it on."

13:36.649 --> 13:39.235
So I go try it on and she goes,
"Okay, you can have it."

13:39.318 --> 13:41.362
Are you very close
to your grandmother?

13:41.445 --> 13:44.824
I was, she passed away in 2006.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.158
This is probably, like...

13:46.700 --> 13:49.161
close to the oldest thing in my closet.

13:50.579 --> 13:54.250
The point of this process isn't
to force yourself to eliminate things.

13:54.333 --> 13:58.879
It's really to confirm how you feel about
each and every item that you possess.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.634
I'm just gonna look at you
a little longer.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.387
Just a little longer.

14:06.846 --> 14:12.268
Marie helping us tackle the biggest
challenge, which is our closet space

14:12.351 --> 14:15.729
and the actual organization
is so refreshing.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.190
I'm excited to put everything
where it needs to be.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.901
-Bye, see you soon.
-See you soon. Bye.
Okay, you ready to get this homework done?

14:28.325 --> 14:30.286
Where do I put my keep stuff?

14:32.162 --> 14:33.831
<i>I love my clothes.</i>

14:34.039 --> 14:36.876
I know when it touches my body,
I'm like, "Ooh!" I get it.

14:36.959 --> 14:40.963
I get it. So that, that feeling
that she said that you should feel,

14:41.046 --> 14:43.173
that is-- that's joy.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.676
I feel that with a lot of my items.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.928
For instance, this particular dress,

14:48.012 --> 14:51.181
I was probably 16 or 17
when my grandmother purchased it.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.060
<i>But it was just that memory</i>
<i>of being with her.</i>

14:55.352 --> 14:57.062
<i>And my grandmother loved clothes,</i>

14:57.146 --> 14:59.106
<i>so we have that in common.</i>

14:59.648 --> 15:00.482
So...

15:03.319 --> 15:05.738
It's kinda hard to let it go,
'cause I really like this one.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.325
And I wear it all the time.
That's probably why it's faded, too.

15:09.992 --> 15:10.826
But...

15:12.828 --> 15:15.748
This just takes me back
to a time with her and

15:15.831 --> 15:17.875
not really-- I mean I spent
a lot of time with her,

15:17.958 --> 15:20.461
but I just want it--
just I always remember--

15:21.754 --> 15:23.297
I think I might cry now.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.601
You okay?

15:35.851 --> 15:36.936
So you didn't just--

15:37.019 --> 15:38.062
You okay?

15:39.063 --> 15:40.439
-Aww...

15:40.564 --> 15:41.732
It's okay.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.623
- <i>Hi!</i>
<i>-</i> <i>Hi!</i>

15:57.706 --> 15:59.541
-How are you? Hi.
-Oh my goodness gracious.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.378
London, come on, let's go.
Let's go outside, honey.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.463
Teddy, London, outside, let's go.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.881
Go. Git.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.716
There you go.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.346
How's it going?
How was the homework?

16:13.013 --> 16:13.847
Um...

16:14.807 --> 16:16.934
-Well...

16:17.017 --> 16:17.935
First things first,

16:18.394 --> 16:21.021
these items are the things
that we've touched on

16:21.105 --> 16:22.731
and loved on and thanked,

16:22.815 --> 16:26.443
but they no longer serve
a purpose for us, so we're actually...

16:26.944 --> 16:28.988
in the process of donating.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.365
- That's great.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.282
Okay.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.576
- I'd love to see the rest.
-Great. Okay.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.579
- I was wondering,

16:37.663 --> 16:40.249
what did you do with the dress
that your grandmother gave you?

16:40.332 --> 16:43.210
I still have it.
It's just next to the bed.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.630
I knew I was gonna go through...

16:47.965 --> 16:50.843
the changes in my mind and in my body,

16:50.926 --> 16:55.431
especially with my clothes, because I do--
I love my clothes.

16:55.514 --> 17:00.227
But I have to learn to extract
the memory from an item.

17:00.644 --> 17:04.773
That dress brings up my grandmother,
and I guess it's just more of a sad place

17:04.857 --> 17:06.150
because she's no longer here.

17:06.608 --> 17:10.154
I am gonna donate or give away or...

17:11.113 --> 17:13.407
if anyone wants it.

17:13.490 --> 17:16.035
It's healthy to revisit and to remember,

17:16.118 --> 17:19.413
and obviously I want a part
of my grandmother to be in my home,

17:19.496 --> 17:23.751
but there are a lot of different things
that could remind me of her.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.627
A question I had,

17:26.336 --> 17:29.423
what is the best way to fold
the hoodies,

17:29.506 --> 17:31.216
because they get so bulky

17:31.300 --> 17:34.470
and I feel like it doesn't remain folded.

17:38.015 --> 17:41.101
So there are two ways to store hoodies.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.812
You can store them in drawers

17:43.896 --> 17:45.731
or you can pile them together.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.692
If you were storing them in drawers,

17:50.027 --> 17:52.154
aim for that rectangle in the middle,

17:52.237 --> 17:53.822
fold towards the center...

17:55.949 --> 17:57.534
...tuck the hood in...

17:59.078 --> 18:01.497
...and roll into thirds,

18:01.580 --> 18:02.831
so you can file them vertically

18:02.915 --> 18:05.000
-in the drawer if you like.
- Okay.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.001
And then,

18:06.085 --> 18:08.962
what is the best way
to fold undergarments?

18:11.131 --> 18:13.509
I consider bras
very important for women,

18:13.592 --> 18:17.429
so I like to file them in a way
that really, truly sparks joy.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.438
Bras are special items for women.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.942
So let's store them with VIP treatment.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.027
When storing bras,

18:32.111 --> 18:36.990
arrange them in a way where
you don't smoosh the cups.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.620
It'll spark joy if you arrange them
in a way that creates a color gradient.

18:42.412 --> 18:47.459
Let's fold the cupless bras.

18:48.085 --> 18:49.503
Fold it in half...

18:50.712 --> 18:52.381
and tuck in the straps.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.968
They can be stored in this way.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.513
For soft cup bras.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.182
Fold it in half,

19:03.433 --> 19:05.144
tuck in the straps,

19:06.019 --> 19:08.355
then roll it up

19:08.438 --> 19:10.482
for a refreshing way to store it.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.988
When storing bras,

19:16.071 --> 19:20.868
if you put them in boxes,
it'll look more organized.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.039
Okay. Just a little quick peek.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.920
And most importantly, shoes.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.130
What happened to those?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.631
The shoes are still mixed.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.135
What we are trying to figure out
is if it'll be easier to leave

19:38.218 --> 19:40.929
in the shoe box
or to take the shoes out.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.600
I will make this my homework
and think about it.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.102
-So okay, leave that up to me.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.271
Don't worry too much
about the storage solution.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.443
So today I'd like to move
onto the miscellaneous items

19:54.526 --> 19:56.987
and I recommend tackling the kitchen.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.030
Okay.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.081
Just take everything out,
even the tupperwares, everything out,

20:08.165 --> 20:10.209
and just go through them and ask yourself

20:10.292 --> 20:14.296
if you see any items
that don't belong to your life ahead,

20:14.379 --> 20:16.423
that you don't necessarily feel
like it should be

20:16.506 --> 20:18.258
a part of your life going forward.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.885
Okay. Now...

20:21.929 --> 20:23.347
Some spices.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.682
Um, we have some pantry items.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.434
Oh, I see.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.103
If there are any expired items,

20:30.187 --> 20:32.272
this is a great opportunity
to toss them.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.398
Oh, for sure.

20:36.860 --> 20:42.199
The main tip on organizing
the pantry is to categorize food items.

20:42.282 --> 20:46.036
For example, the drinks category
such as coffee and tea.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.871
Cereals and snacks.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.541
Pasta, flour, and other carbohydrates.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.086
And finally canned foods.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.213
For small items such as snacks,

20:56.296 --> 20:59.633
if you put them in boxes
it'll be easier to access

20:59.716 --> 21:01.260
and it'll look more organized.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.761
By storing your food like this,

21:02.844 --> 21:08.100
it will make it easy to keep track
of the quantity of food you have.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.606
Next time I'm here, I will have
solutions for you in terms of storage

21:14.690 --> 21:16.525
for all your miscellaneous items.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.901
-See you next week.
-Next time.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.569
Thank you guys. Bye bye.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.740
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.118
Okay.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.036
-We have more homework to do.
-More homework.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.122
Oh, goodness.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.332
It's about to go down.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.584
-Soy sauce.
-Soy.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.087
This is disgusting. Throw it away.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.422
Why?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.841
-Oh!
-Why, Alishia?

21:41.174 --> 21:42.134
Don't why me.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.845
We don't eat ketchup.
Is there ketchup in the refrigerator?

21:46.847 --> 21:47.681
Yes, there is.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.891
You know what, ketchup?
You don't bring me joy anymore.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.393
Oh, my gosh.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.061
Uh-oh.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.563
Don't even look.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.565
What is that? Gravy?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.275
Turkey gravy, slow cooker.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.192
There you go.

22:00.235 --> 22:03.739
You've got turkey gravy from 2015!

22:05.365 --> 22:10.662
I feel like you've been holding onto
that turkey gravy just to be spiteful.

22:10.746 --> 22:14.791
-We need to figure out...
- Stop sliding that.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.002
-Ugh...
- Pick it up. Put it in the back.

22:17.085 --> 22:17.919
I don't reach.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.172
Oh, my goodness. Short people.

22:20.255 --> 22:24.343
Angela and I have a disconnect
on where do we put these items.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.928
Her access is different from my access.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.473
Basic access is height.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.058
<i>We have a lot of cabinet space</i>

22:31.141 --> 22:33.727
<i>where I can put stuff higher</i>
<i>and reach things,</i>

22:33.810 --> 22:36.813
<i>but she does more of the cooking,</i>
<i>so it needs to be where she can reach it.</i>

22:36.897 --> 22:38.523
Unless she doesn't want me to touch it.
And then I just put it really high.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.651
Like my things.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.072
"Don't touch my stuff, Alishia."

22:45.697 --> 22:47.616
Have you gone through these glasses?

22:47.783 --> 22:48.658
Yeah.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.410
They don't look like you went through 'em.

22:50.494 --> 22:52.662
Don't sort my things,
sort your things, 'kay?

22:52.746 --> 22:55.624
Oh, those are fighting words!

22:55.707 --> 22:58.502
"Don't sort my things, hmm hmm hmm."

22:58.627 --> 22:59.586
Meow!

22:59.878 --> 23:01.088
- <i>We disagree on</i>

23:01.171 --> 23:03.131
- <i>Organization.</i>
<i>-...where things should go</i>

23:03.215 --> 23:04.966
<i>and how things should be done.</i>

23:05.050 --> 23:09.179
If I had to give you an example of
what type of person I think Angela is,

23:09.262 --> 23:11.807
she will put a blender...

23:12.641 --> 23:13.642
in the linen closet.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.061
Why is this here?

23:16.812 --> 23:19.272
"Well, all the electronics are in there."

23:19.356 --> 23:21.316
So in her mind it makes sense.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.443
And then in mine I'm like, "No."

23:23.527 --> 23:26.238
It made sense at the time and so I did it.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.615
You can get rid of those
pink ones.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.409
What about these dirty
yellow ones?

23:30.492 --> 23:31.785
You're sorting my stuff again.

23:31.868 --> 23:34.663
Jesus, let go of it. Let go.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.456
- You are real judgy today.
-Well.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.959
These are actually, like, seeing glasses.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.502
These are not for style.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.504
Why don't you just put them all in there?

23:42.587 --> 23:45.841
You have a problem with wanting
to put things in different places.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.969
One of the things that Marie
made very clear is that

23:49.052 --> 23:52.806
even though you have different ideas,
like items need to be together here.

23:53.306 --> 23:56.893
So once we sift through that
a little more,

23:58.228 --> 24:00.272
with time, I think we'll be good.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.115
- Hi!
- Hello!

24:10.198 --> 24:11.992
-Hi.
-Come on in.

24:12.075 --> 24:15.370
-Come on in, welcome, welcome, welcome.
-Hi.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.622
-Come on in.
-Nice to see you. Wow.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.790
You guys brought gifts.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.877
Yes, many of them.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.753
- Let's get right into it.
-Yeah.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.089
- What's our next dilemma?
- Shoes.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.632
When storing all these shoes,

24:27.716 --> 24:30.343
try to imagine
what a store display would look like.

24:30.427 --> 24:33.013
So just keep the similar colors together,

24:33.096 --> 24:34.514
same types of shoes together.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.517
- So the shoe boxes.
- Can we keep the shoe boxes?

24:37.601 --> 24:39.394
-Yeah. So like that, right?
-Right.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.606
So we could just put the shoe
box here and then the shoes on top.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.983
The only thing about this shelf...

24:45.442 --> 24:46.568
are the heels.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.947
I actually have the same rack
in my closet, too

24:51.031 --> 24:53.283
and that's always been my
problem that I have.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.701
Oh, snap! Look at that!

24:54.784 --> 24:59.331
Even these you can fit
and it won't fall through.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.373
Okay.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.167
-Wow.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.169
You solved that problem so fast.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.462
For me in my house,

25:05.545 --> 25:08.924
I tend to use pretty postcards
or things that spark joy for me.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.425
Oh, nice, okay.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.010
I can do that.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.638
- What should we move onto now?

25:14.721 --> 25:16.932
I'd like to continue
with the lesson on <i>komono.</i>

25:17.015 --> 25:18.183
Yes.

25:19.809 --> 25:20.936
<i>So...</i>

25:21.019 --> 25:23.271
<i>I don't know what to do</i>
<i>with our dog items</i>

25:23.355 --> 25:25.565
<i>'cause they are in multiple places.</i>

25:25.649 --> 25:26.691
Let's take a look.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.527
Oh, they're getting excited.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.445
"That's my stuff!"

25:30.529 --> 25:32.614
So we have three fur babies.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.157
-Welcome to our family.
-Right.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.827
<i>Um, untraditional,</i>
<i>but traditional at the same time.</i>

25:37.911 --> 25:39.246
<i>We're like the Brady Bunch.</i>

25:39.329 --> 25:42.249
It was really important finding a space
that they could--

25:42.332 --> 25:44.251
we could all co-habitate together.
Um, so the balconies are really nice

25:46.378 --> 25:47.546
'cause they can go outside

25:47.629 --> 25:49.589
on the balconies
and kinda get that airspace.

25:49.673 --> 25:52.175
It's important that we get the space
together for them, too.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.218
Oh, yes.

25:53.301 --> 25:55.345
'Cause as you can see,
they're up in everything.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.429
Oh, yes.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.975
So what's in here?
What's in this basket?

26:00.058 --> 26:04.187
So, they have a lot of toys
and I want them to be able to get them.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.064
But I also want the toys out the way.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.400
I don't know how
she found all these balls.

26:08.483 --> 26:13.780
Well, granted at our last place,
we lived next to a tennis court.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.449
Can you select how many
tennis balls you need?

26:16.866 --> 26:18.034
-One.
-Just one?

26:19.244 --> 26:21.913
- She wants her tennis balls.

26:21.997 --> 26:26.293
I would say more than that because
sometimes at the park they get nasty

26:26.418 --> 26:28.295
and we don't want to bring it home.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.547
- Two?
- Three. Mhm.
- Three tennis balls.
-Three, okay.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.469
You definitely use these for walks, right?

26:36.553 --> 26:38.471
-The leashes.
-Yes. And so we have--

26:39.347 --> 26:40.682
we just need to put it somewhere.

26:42.350 --> 26:45.478
So for the kitten
and doggie supplies,

26:45.562 --> 26:49.691
I think using this whole section
for their items would be best.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.402
Just hanging them right here
and putting the leash

26:52.485 --> 26:54.946
will help identify this section.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.035
When tidying pet supplies,

27:00.118 --> 27:03.121
it's important to create
a space for them.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.957
Here's a tip for storing pet items.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.250
For example,

27:07.792 --> 27:08.835
you can put toys here.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.170
This is a toy.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.923
Leashes go here.
Grooming and food supplies here.

27:14.007 --> 27:17.469
If you divide the space,
it'll look more tidy.

27:17.927 --> 27:22.891
For dogs, you take them
on a walk every day

27:23.016 --> 27:28.438
so you can put leashes on a hook
and put them on the wall.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.274
I never got a chance
to use a leash like this

27:31.358 --> 27:35.820
because I only had eel-like fish
as pets when I was little.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.658
You want to go
to the master bath?

27:39.741 --> 27:41.493
- Let's take a look.
- Sure.

27:41.576 --> 27:45.121
<i>The bathroom is kind of</i>
<i>a mixed-use space.</i>

27:45.205 --> 27:47.040
Angela is a groomaholic.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.249
So...

27:48.833 --> 27:52.921
for instance, hairbrushes,
shampoos, conditioners...

27:53.755 --> 27:55.131
The woman is insane.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.258
<i> My bathroom</i>
<i>needs to be organized.</i>

27:57.342 --> 28:00.845
-I need to be an arm reach away from...
-She uses so many products.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.056
...my brush and my gel
and my hair lotion.

28:03.139 --> 28:06.559
"I need contact solution, I need this,
I need that, I need--" I'm like, "Oh."

28:06.643 --> 28:08.561
I don't want anything
on the bathroom counter.

28:08.645 --> 28:11.356
I like cohesiveness
and she just likes accessibility.

28:11.439 --> 28:15.610
So these items here,
Angela uses these daily.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.696
-Hmm.
-Along with...

28:19.197 --> 28:20.824
...these, daily.

28:20.907 --> 28:23.910
And then we have the makeup brushes

28:23.993 --> 28:25.745
and lipsticks.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.455
Oh, more hair stuff.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.833
Oh, that's like my hair stuff.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.837
So, the point here
for storage in the bathroom

28:33.920 --> 28:36.005
is to section it off with smaller boxes

28:36.089 --> 28:37.757
and utilize the space that way.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.009
-Game changer!
- We need a lot of those.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.052
Yes.

28:41.177 --> 28:44.222
- Let's stack them.
-Game changer!

28:46.766 --> 28:50.061
-I'm never gonna throw away a box again.
- Yeah, it makes sense now.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.148
As soon as she put
that little box in there,

28:53.231 --> 28:56.985
it all just came full circle.
I was like, "Ah!"

28:57.652 --> 28:59.112
-I like that.
-Yeah.

28:59.946 --> 29:02.449
Okay. We're moving on.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.992
<i>Now with the bathroom,</i>

29:04.075 --> 29:06.494
<i>even though we're in the same drawer</i>
<i>we're still separated.</i>

29:06.619 --> 29:08.830
That way, it's not messy. You know, it's--

29:08.913 --> 29:10.749
You still have your little bit of space.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.126
-You want me to take something for you?

29:13.251 --> 29:14.377
Thank you.

29:15.712 --> 29:18.381
The cool part
has definitely been organizing,

29:18.465 --> 29:20.550
um, as opposed to kinda
letting go of things.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.844
<i>Since all of our stuff</i>
<i>was together,</i>

29:23.011 --> 29:24.804
<i>I think, you know, we blended,</i>

29:24.888 --> 29:30.226
<i>but now that we have our designated spaces</i>
<i>but we still have our communal things,</i>

29:30.310 --> 29:32.228
everything else is just gonna
fall into place.

29:32.312 --> 29:35.523
So we are going all drinkware here,

29:35.732 --> 29:37.734
all food items here,

29:37.942 --> 29:40.195
-and dishes are staying there.
-Yeah.

29:40.528 --> 29:42.363
We work well together...

29:43.156 --> 29:45.366
when we have a clear path.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.118
Let's get to it, let's chop chop.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.703
Big, big.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.830
Small, small.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.832
The common goal was this is our home,

29:53.374 --> 29:56.878
and we want it to be ease for both of us.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.422
- We like straws.
- Boxes. Bam.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.467
High five. Mm.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.970
We want to be able to move-- maneuver
without, you know, restrictions.

30:06.054 --> 30:10.308
Now it's like all the things
that we love sparks that ding!

30:10.600 --> 30:12.143
-The what?
-Ding!

30:13.353 --> 30:15.772
That's like my favorite thing, like...

30:15.855 --> 30:16.815
Ding!

30:17.440 --> 30:19.526
It's all Alishia's stuff
that has to move.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.736
You just seem so excited about that.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.197
I want a little corner,
that's all, to call my own.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.033
- This is your corner.
-Yeah, it's my corner now.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.578
Our biggest headache was her getting
her closet in order and then

30:30.662 --> 30:31.996
me getting my closet in order.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.707
And so once we got things separated
we can kind of do our own thing.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.544
I've taken my things
out of the dresser,

30:37.627 --> 30:40.672
so this is gonna be all Angela's items.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.841
Aren't you happy? You get your own space.

30:42.924 --> 30:46.094
I'm so excited to have some space.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.929
Things had to get worse first...

30:48.555 --> 30:51.975
before we started to really understand
what the process was about,

30:52.058 --> 30:55.103
knowing that, you know,
we are doing this journey together,

30:55.186 --> 30:58.773
but we do have an individual journey
that we need to take

30:58.857 --> 31:02.151
before we kinda get together
and tackle the things that we...

31:03.278 --> 31:04.112
co-own.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.990
I am exhausted
from a hard day's work.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.869
Alishia, she's determined
to get this shelf in order.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.120
<i>The bickering is...</i>

31:13.079 --> 31:15.707
-It's slowly on the decline.

31:15.790 --> 31:17.083
I love her more.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.293
-Do ya?
-I do.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.670
I didn't think that was possible.

31:20.753 --> 31:23.089
You'd be surprised
what a little organization could do.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.508
So obviously our wedding book,

31:25.592 --> 31:28.094
wedding gift book, remember?

31:29.345 --> 31:33.683
I think we kind of actually started
organizing in the same...

31:34.434 --> 31:36.853
-you know, the same fashion now as well.
-Mm-hmm.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.938
Marie is gonna be so excited.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.732
I hope she likes it.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.775
Everybody's knocked out.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.162
Marie's here.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.293
- Hi!
- Hi, Marie!

32:00.585 --> 32:03.546
How are you? Good to see you. Welcome.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.173
Hi!

32:05.256 --> 32:06.633
Good to see you.

32:06.716 --> 32:08.426
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

32:08.509 --> 32:09.552
-Good, good.
-Good.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.346
-More boxes.
- I know!

32:11.429 --> 32:13.222
-We ran out.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.474
Ready to see what we've done?

32:14.557 --> 32:17.018
-Yes, absolutely. Let's go.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.107
- <i>Our space now...</i>
- <i>It's like a welcome home.</i>

32:23.191 --> 32:25.026
- <i>Oh yeah.</i>
- <i>Like, you did it.</i>

32:27.695 --> 32:30.490
<i>There's no roadblocks,</i>
<i>I know where everything is, it's perfect.</i>

32:30.573 --> 32:31.824
Mhm.
<i>Things you eat with.</i>

32:33.326 --> 32:35.328
Oh, look how neat it looks.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.665
<i>I remember at first, the biggest</i>
<i>task was, I don't organize like she does.</i>

32:38.748 --> 32:40.416
- Right.
- And vice versa.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.460
And now we kinda see eye to eye on...

32:42.543 --> 32:44.545
Everything is right here.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.298
Right, and it makes sense
to be right there.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.301
-Yeah, common ground on organization.
-Yeah.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.053
- Ready to move on?
- Yeah.

32:53.429 --> 32:55.348
<i>That second room,</i>
<i>we kept the door shut</i>

32:55.431 --> 32:57.183
<i>because we didn't want to see</i>
<i>all that stuff.</i>

32:57.266 --> 32:59.644
- <i>Goodness gracious.</i>

33:00.186 --> 33:03.022
- <i>This is amazing.</i>

33:03.147 --> 33:05.316
<i>Now we can actually...</i>
- <i>Walk in there.</i>

33:05.400 --> 33:08.194
<i>I leave the door open now</i>
<i>'cause I like looking at the space.</i>

33:10.655 --> 33:13.616
<i>Look how well</i>
<i>you've used the space.</i>

33:14.033 --> 33:16.577
-<i> Now you know where everything is.</i>

33:16.661 --> 33:18.454
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- <i>It's easy to find.</i>

33:18.871 --> 33:21.290
I'm excited for people to come
and see this. "Look what I did."

33:23.376 --> 33:24.377
We did a good job, Honey.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.628
- Yeah.
-Yeah.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.007
We're a couple, we're together,
we share a lot of things together,

33:29.090 --> 33:32.593
but everything got a lot better
when we designated our own spaces.

33:34.220 --> 33:37.140
<i>Look how neat and simple it looks</i>
<i>when you open the closet.</i>

33:37.223 --> 33:39.017
- <i>I love it.</i>
- <i>It's amazing.</i>

33:39.100 --> 33:42.061
<i>We don't really have to struggle</i>
<i>through the other person's things</i>

33:42.145 --> 33:43.396
<i>to get to our own.</i>

33:43.646 --> 33:45.148
<i>To just kinda have that...</i>

33:45.440 --> 33:48.359
<i>individuality has kinda</i>
<i>made a world of difference.</i>

33:49.485 --> 33:52.405
<i>That was the biggest transformation,</i>
<i>I think.</i>

33:52.488 --> 33:54.073
<i>So going through the process took care</i>

33:54.157 --> 33:56.159
<i>of a lot of those little blips</i>
<i>and stresses.</i>

33:57.952 --> 34:01.831
<i>It's also, like, soothing</i>
<i>to open the drawer</i>

34:01.914 --> 34:03.833
<i>because you know it's in order.</i>

34:04.834 --> 34:07.879
<i>We've gained a deeper respect</i>
<i>for each other's belongings</i>

34:07.962 --> 34:11.632
<i>and we really got to learn a lot</i>
<i>about each other in that process as well,</i>

34:11.716 --> 34:14.302
<i>and see why that item brings them joy.</i>

34:14.844 --> 34:18.264
So, it was really therapeutic
in our relationship as far as just

34:18.347 --> 34:20.266
getting to know each other
a little bit better.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.520
We're so grateful for you to come in
and just show us something

34:24.645 --> 34:29.025
we thought we possessed within ourselves,
but we just didn't know how to exert it.

34:29.108 --> 34:32.070
<i>You gave us the tools</i>
<i>that we needed to really</i>

34:32.153 --> 34:33.237
<i>put things together.</i>

34:33.321 --> 34:35.907
<i>I think when we first came in</i>
<i>and we welcomed the home</i>

34:35.990 --> 34:38.409
<i>and we really wanted to</i>
<i>envision the space,</i>

34:38.493 --> 34:40.495
I think
we're coming to that point where...

34:40.578 --> 34:42.705
-this is how we wanted the space to be.
-Oh, yeah.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.876
- You guys get an A+.
-Nice.

34:46.959 --> 34:51.089

34:58.054 --> 34:59.305

-High five.

34:59.388 --> 35:00.389
Yes. We did it.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.893
We are ambassadors
of Marie Kondo. Like look,

35:04.644 --> 35:05.812
this'll change your life.

35:05.895 --> 35:08.022
-Seriously.
-And it's not just about organization,

35:08.106 --> 35:09.941
-it's really a lifestyle change.
-Oh, yeah.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.318
Um, and it really is therapeutic

35:12.401 --> 35:14.654
-and it'll change things in your life.
-Oh, yeah.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.531
-Thank you!
-Thank you so much.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.615
Much!

35:17.698 --> 35:19.700
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.536
Have a good day, guys.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.287
-Bye!
- We'll keep you posted.

35:23.371 --> 35:27.333
She didn't just come by, she came in
and she, like, left her stamp.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.335
-Her aura's around the house.
-Definitely.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.295
-We really appreciate you.
-We appreciate-- Yeah.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.922
Thank you so much for just...

35:33.548 --> 35:36.134
changing how we view our items,

35:36.217 --> 35:38.886
how we view our clothes,
how we view our animals.

35:38.970 --> 35:43.099
Like, there's just a different level
of appreciation that we have for...

35:43.599 --> 35:45.268
-everything in the home now.
-Everything.
