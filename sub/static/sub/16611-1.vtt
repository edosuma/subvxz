00:31.998 --> 00:34.364
Father, please.

00:34.366 --> 00:36.433
Please help me.

00:36.435 --> 00:38.403
I will, my child.

00:38.405 --> 00:39.304
I will.

00:45.244 --> 00:46.278
Victoria...

00:49.215 --> 00:53.453
I believe we need to
perform an exorcism.

00:55.287 --> 00:59.190
But I cannot do that
without the consent

00:59.192 --> 01:01.293
of the person who is possessed.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.394
That's why I'm here tonight.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.196
I need your permission.

01:06.198 --> 01:08.933
You need my permission?

01:08.935 --> 01:11.601
Because there's a
chance I could die?

01:11.603 --> 01:12.605
Right?

01:15.207 --> 01:16.141
Yes.

01:19.846 --> 01:21.379
Of course.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.816
Of course you can.

01:24.016 --> 01:27.552
Anything to get this,
this thing, out of me.

01:36.728 --> 01:38.629
Go ahead and try it
you fucking priest!

01:38.631 --> 01:41.198
You really think you can
expel me, be my guest!

01:41.200 --> 01:43.135
I will rip you to pieces!

01:45.605 --> 01:47.004
What's the matter Priest?

01:47.006 --> 01:48.474
Scared?

01:52.177 --> 01:55.746
Creature, it is you
who should fear me.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.884
I'll never let you have her.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.752
Then by all means,
try to save her.

02:01.754 --> 02:05.625
In the end, I will be
laughing and she will be dead!

03:33.513 --> 03:35.846
Oh, this thing
is such a wreck!

03:35.848 --> 03:37.850
This is a disaster.

03:40.286 --> 03:41.420
Oh!

03:45.123 --> 03:47.024
Glen, what are you doing?

03:47.026 --> 03:50.428
Just trying
out my sweet new camera.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.163
Come on, say something
interesting Vic.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.402
Oh come on man, don't
leave me hanging!

04:00.639 --> 04:02.806
Your car's a piece of crap!

04:02.808 --> 04:06.177
Hey, hey, never
talk bad about my baby!

04:06.179 --> 04:09.447
- Your baby?
- Besides.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.983
It's better than Mark's
piece of shit car.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.217
- Ooh!
- Fuck you, all right?

04:14.219 --> 04:17.921
Aw, come on
man, don't be bitter.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.389
Who says I'm bitter?

04:19.391 --> 04:22.860
Shit, I'm not the one covering
up my insecurities buddy.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.695
Well your
sister didn't seem

04:24.697 --> 04:26.563
to think I was so insecure.

04:26.565 --> 04:28.098
Ew.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.868
- You're such an asshole.
- Oh, oh shit!

04:30.870 --> 04:32.402
Harassment, assault.

04:32.404 --> 04:34.005
I caught it all on camera!

04:34.007 --> 04:36.139
- Vic, did you see that?
- Pussy.

04:36.141 --> 04:37.675
I mean come
on Vic your brother

04:37.677 --> 04:40.780
gets assaulted in broad daylight
and you're just laughing?

04:41.747 --> 04:43.248
Yeah, I am!

04:44.384 --> 04:46.817
Dude, you guys are
both dumbasses, okay?

04:46.819 --> 04:49.353
- I'm not a dumbass.
- He is.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.421
And what are you saying, huh?

04:51.423 --> 04:54.324
You need your little
sister to take care of you?

04:55.795 --> 04:58.698
Dude, I thought it was supposed
to be the other way around.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.567
You're the other way around.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.435
Ooh!

05:05.437 --> 05:07.240
You got me good, bro.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.611
Listen up, idiot!

05:13.045 --> 05:14.545
We need to start working
on your piece of shit car.

05:14.547 --> 05:16.546
You know, I do have
other things to do,

05:16.548 --> 05:17.883
besides this.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.950
Like what, yourself?

05:20.952 --> 05:22.822
Oh gross!

05:24.257 --> 05:27.158
I do not wanna know what you
guys do when you're bored!

05:27.160 --> 05:28.995
Can we just get
this thing going?

05:30.495 --> 05:32.562
Well, you can
start with the engine.

05:49.548 --> 05:51.281
Oh good, you boys are here.

05:51.283 --> 05:53.983
Can you help me with
the groceries please?

05:53.985 --> 05:55.320
Sure thing Mom.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.324
Sure, Mrs. Martin.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.058
- Hi Mom.
- Hey Victoria.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.526
We're having linguine and
clams tonight for dinner,

06:03.528 --> 06:05.495
so don't fill up
on anything, okay?

06:05.497 --> 06:06.796
Can you tell your dad?

06:06.798 --> 06:08.632
Okay Mom, I will.

06:08.634 --> 06:10.166
Oh wait, Aunt Maria called,

06:10.168 --> 06:11.668
she wanted you to
give her a call back.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.003
Something about the mortgage
broker she's dealing with.

06:14.005 --> 06:16.673
Okay, all right, thank you.

06:16.675 --> 06:18.242
I had this Asian chick.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.644
- Asian chick, huh?
- Every day.

06:20.646 --> 06:23.279
Vic, hey Vic!

06:23.281 --> 06:25.014
Okay, so she's just
gonna go in the house?

06:25.016 --> 06:26.752
She's obviously
not gonna help.

06:27.754 --> 06:28.952
You take that one too.

06:28.954 --> 06:30.687
- I'm not taking it.
- Why?

06:30.689 --> 06:33.759
Because this is your
house, those are yours.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.502
Hi Daddy!

06:47.639 --> 06:49.108
Oh Dad.

06:52.310 --> 06:54.178
Guess who!

06:54.180 --> 06:57.214
Hmm, ah, it's not Glen,

06:57.216 --> 06:59.250
because his hands are
always disgusting.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.920
I'm sorry Sweetie, I'm just,

07:02.922 --> 07:04.654
I'm neck deep in
this case right now.

07:04.656 --> 07:08.625
And I just, it could be
such a great one for us.

07:08.627 --> 07:09.860
It's all right Dad.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.127
I just came to tell
you that Mom is making

07:11.129 --> 07:13.197
linguine and clams
tonight for dinner,

07:13.199 --> 07:15.365
good luck concentrating now!

07:15.367 --> 07:17.735
Wait, your
mom's home already?

07:17.737 --> 07:19.170
Seems like she just left.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.404
Yeah, she just got
back from the store.

07:21.406 --> 07:23.039
I guess they let her out
early at the hospital.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.642
Oh, lucky her.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.178
Did you tell her
Aunt Maria called?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.079
It seemed pretty urgent.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.548
How could I forget?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.449
I was the one stuck talking
to her for half an hour!

07:33.685 --> 07:34.952
Well don't worry about me,

07:34.954 --> 07:36.887
I can concentrate
through anything.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.824
Remember, I grew up
with you two brats.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.324
I heard that.

07:41.326 --> 07:43.062
I second that.

08:01.447 --> 08:04.147
Victoria honey, you're
not touching your noodles.

08:04.149 --> 08:05.548
You're not feeling good?

08:05.550 --> 08:07.218
Did you eat something earlier?

08:07.220 --> 08:10.286
I don't know, I'm
just not very hungry.

08:10.288 --> 08:11.956
Sorry Mom.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.123
Are you still
not sleeping honey?

08:14.125 --> 08:16.594
Ugh, no.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.462
That medicine you gave me
is not working very well.

08:19.464 --> 08:21.366
Why didn't
you say something?

08:22.767 --> 08:26.670
I don't know, I just
didn't want you to worry.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.171
It's not that big of a deal,

08:28.173 --> 08:30.173
I'm not like falling
over at work or anything.

08:30.175 --> 08:32.278
I'm just a little tired.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.979
Well if you're not
getting any sleep or feeling

08:35.981 --> 08:38.181
any better, we can get
you something different.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.482
You know, I am a doctor.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.784
I mean, I do know what
I'm talking about.

08:41.787 --> 08:44.190
Unlike what some
people might think.

08:46.893 --> 08:47.791
What?

08:47.793 --> 08:48.993
So what about you Glen?

08:48.995 --> 08:50.326
How was your day?

08:50.328 --> 08:52.463
Any closer to moving out?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.498
- John!
- What?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.333
The boy's 24 years old,

08:56.335 --> 08:58.905
he doesn't need to keep
living with Mommy and Daddy.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.438
His girlfriend's
got her own place

09:01.440 --> 09:04.710
and she spends more time
here than he does there.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.647
I'm still looking Dad.

09:09.649 --> 09:12.516
It's not like I'll be
living here when I'm 40.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.785
- Oh Glen.
- Let's hope not.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.522
Besides, I don't see how
it's fair that I pay rent,

09:18.524 --> 09:20.324
and all I get is a
purple room upstairs,

09:20.326 --> 09:22.258
while old Vic here gets
the entire downstairs.

09:22.260 --> 09:24.062
Oh, cry me a river.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.698
When Victoria finishes
an expensive trade school

09:27.700 --> 09:30.066
that we paid for
and then comes back

09:30.068 --> 09:32.036
to live in our house
and use our electricity

09:32.038 --> 09:34.340
and water, she will pay rent.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.510
So, how
is your job going?

09:38.510 --> 09:39.910
It's going pretty well.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.146
They even paid
for my new camera.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.814
Oh, nice.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.150
So when you have your next gig,

09:46.152 --> 09:47.820
we can all come
and watch, right?

09:49.020 --> 09:52.656
Dad, you just can't
walk onto a film set.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.725
I'm sorry, but there
are rules I must follow.

09:55.727 --> 09:57.427
Okay, I
wasn't aware of that,

09:57.429 --> 09:59.463
but I guess it'll come out
and we'll get to see it

09:59.465 --> 10:01.799
and I'm sure it will be great.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.201
Yeah.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.871
So Victoria, are you
going out tonight?

10:07.873 --> 10:09.542
Oh no, no.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.041
I've got some stuff to get done,

10:12.043 --> 10:13.946
just laundry mostly.

10:18.683 --> 10:21.986
But Glen, we're still going
out later this week, right?

10:21.988 --> 10:23.923
I got Thursday
night off from work.

10:25.323 --> 10:28.492
Yeah, sure, Bro and Sis,

10:28.494 --> 10:29.928
hanging like bros.

10:32.063 --> 10:33.466
Don't do that.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.968
I told you a
million times before,

10:37.970 --> 10:39.869
why don't you just
leave your laundry out?

10:39.871 --> 10:41.472
I'll take care of
it, I do your dad's,

10:41.474 --> 10:44.307
I do your brother's,
it's not a big deal.

10:44.309 --> 10:47.578
Really Mom, it's,
I'm all right.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.079
I'd just rather do it myself.

10:50.081 --> 10:52.518
All right. Fine.

10:54.019 --> 10:57.523
Then I'm done offering.

10:58.823 --> 11:00.357
Thank god for that.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.292
All right, well, I guess
nobody wants dessert tonight.

11:03.294 --> 11:06.197
- Wait!
- Nobody said that.

11:07.932 --> 11:09.400
So Vic.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.468
Movie night, that new
horror film just came out.

11:11.470 --> 11:12.969
God no!

11:12.971 --> 11:14.171
No horror!

11:14.173 --> 11:15.605
Dude, every time
you pick the movie,

11:15.607 --> 11:17.775
it's really friggin scary.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.108
It's my turn to pick.

11:19.110 --> 11:22.378
Something light,
something funny.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.313
Fine.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.114
I don't wanna be up all night!

11:25.116 --> 11:27.151
Fine, you can pick.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.687
But that means you're driving.

11:30.655 --> 11:31.723
Deal.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.176
I can't believe they
were out of everything.

11:53.178 --> 11:56.046
We couldn't even find
a bad movie to watch.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.416
This sucks!

12:00.119 --> 12:01.919
Don't be such a baby.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.487
Jesus!

12:03.489 --> 12:04.854
It seems like every
time we go out,

12:04.856 --> 12:08.057
you find something
to complain about.

12:08.059 --> 12:10.026
Just enjoy the drive.

12:10.028 --> 12:12.364
Enjoy being out of the house.

12:13.532 --> 12:16.668
Well, you sure are
in a chipper mood.

12:18.269 --> 12:20.004
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.638
I was really looking
forward to watching

12:22.640 --> 12:24.340
something new tonight, you know?

12:24.342 --> 12:25.443
But whatever.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.246
Hey.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.916
Since we got nothing
else going on,

12:31.984 --> 12:33.451
let's go say hi to Mark.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.189
Sounds good.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.828
Do you wanna call him first?

12:44.230 --> 12:46.430
Nah, it would be funnier
if we just showed up.

12:49.534 --> 12:52.036
I guess my laundry
will just have to wait.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.907
Yeah, about that.

12:56.107 --> 12:58.574
Why won't you let
Mom do your laundry?

12:58.576 --> 13:00.379
Afraid of what she might find?

13:01.647 --> 13:04.116
Ha ha. Very funny.

13:05.583 --> 13:09.721
No I just, I don't wanna rely
on Mom and Dad for everything.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.458
Unlike you, I wanna be
outta there after college.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.460
That's why I'm
working at the club.

13:17.462 --> 13:20.196
I hate asking Mom
and Dad for money.

13:20.198 --> 13:22.900
I prefer to maintain
my own life.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.037
At least as much as possible.

13:26.238 --> 13:29.473
Well, then just
give me your share.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.576
I need all the money
I can get right now.

13:33.211 --> 13:35.548
The life of a starving artist.

13:36.682 --> 13:37.850
You bum!

13:43.655 --> 13:45.454
Well Mark, we haven't
been here in a while,

13:45.456 --> 13:47.456
and you have really
livened up the place.

13:47.458 --> 13:48.691
Ooh!

13:48.693 --> 13:51.060
Stop throwing a freaking
ball in my house.

13:51.062 --> 13:52.195
So I
see you're still

13:52.197 --> 13:53.631
obsessed with all this stuff.

13:54.633 --> 13:58.068
Oh, right, speaking of which,

13:58.070 --> 14:00.137
I found something
that the two of you

14:00.139 --> 14:02.372
might be interested in.

14:02.374 --> 14:03.375
Doubt it.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.446
Oh okay, here it is.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.915
So your mother's
maiden name was...

14:11.917 --> 14:14.383
Palmer, right?

14:14.385 --> 14:16.853
Yeah. Why?

14:16.855 --> 14:18.456
Check this out.

14:21.025 --> 14:22.325
So do you two know anyone

14:22.327 --> 14:24.962
by the name of Garrison Palmer?

14:24.964 --> 14:28.565
Yeah, he is, was,
our grandfather.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.901
But he died before
either of us was born

14:30.903 --> 14:33.302
and Mom doesn't really
talk about him very much.

14:33.304 --> 14:36.541
Apparently he wasn't
the best guy, Grandad.

14:38.277 --> 14:41.180
Shoot, according to this...

14:43.315 --> 14:47.283
He was a part of some
cult in the early 60s.

14:47.285 --> 14:49.153
They were known for
devil worshipping.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.826
And get this, trying
to raise the Dead.

14:55.059 --> 14:58.229
Well, it's no surprise
our mom isn't religious.

14:59.697 --> 15:01.632
Whatever.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.869
Dude, I don't buy
into any of that crap!

15:05.070 --> 15:06.969
Organized religion
is just an excuse

15:06.971 --> 15:09.039
to pawn money off
gullible people

15:09.041 --> 15:11.174
who are easily manipulated.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.945
Afterlife my ass!

15:14.346 --> 15:16.445
Death isn't something you
should think about, you know?

15:16.447 --> 15:17.915
When you die, you die.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.382
That's all there is to it.

15:19.384 --> 15:20.686
Cheerful sis.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.021
I wonder why Mom didn't
tell us about any of this.

15:24.023 --> 15:25.722
Do you think she even knows?

15:25.724 --> 15:27.960
I mean, she was still
pretty young when he died.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.328
So does it say anything else?

15:31.330 --> 15:32.598
Well, I mean...

15:35.934 --> 15:37.868
I mean, they were pretty active.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.070
And then one day
they just all...

15:40.072 --> 15:41.537
Stopped.

15:41.539 --> 15:43.873
Everyone who was involved either

15:43.875 --> 15:46.211
died or pursued other things.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.749
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

15:53.719 --> 15:55.185
But you know what?

15:55.187 --> 15:56.719
It's too bad though.

15:56.721 --> 15:58.622
I would've loved to
ask your grandfather

15:58.624 --> 16:00.190
more about what
it was like to be

16:00.192 --> 16:02.394
a part of something like that.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.966
Dude, is this
what I think it is?

16:08.767 --> 16:11.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah it is.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.670
I got it a while ago.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.504
Never used it before.

16:15.506 --> 16:17.406
Dude, I wanna play with it!

16:17.408 --> 16:19.508
Dude, come on,
let's play with it!

16:19.510 --> 16:20.913
Let's do this!

16:23.315 --> 16:25.850
Come on, don't be a pussy!

16:32.157 --> 16:34.056
So I thought you
guys didn't believe.

16:34.058 --> 16:36.792
We don't, but come
on, this looks like fun.

16:36.794 --> 16:38.328
And besides how often
do you get to say

16:38.330 --> 16:40.932
I played with a Ouija board?

16:48.072 --> 16:50.208
All right, what
should we ask it?

16:51.342 --> 16:53.609
I know, how about,

16:53.611 --> 16:56.079
how many girls has
Mark slept with?

16:56.081 --> 16:58.116
Ha ha, very funny.

16:59.250 --> 17:03.688
How about what is
Victoria's middle name?

17:05.057 --> 17:05.990
No.

17:10.328 --> 17:12.395
Glen, stop moving it!

17:12.396 --> 17:14.131
I'm not,
Mark is doing it!

17:14.133 --> 17:16.098
Mark doesn't know
my middle name!

17:16.101 --> 17:18.602
- Stop it!
- Apparently he does.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.271
Glen, this isn't funny!

17:21.140 --> 17:22.372
Fuck this!

17:22.374 --> 17:24.009
Woah, hey.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.577
That was amazing man.

17:28.579 --> 17:30.915
I didn't even know you
knew her middle name.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.086
I wasn't moving it.

17:35.253 --> 17:36.652
Yeah. Right.

17:36.654 --> 17:38.356
You weren't moving it.

17:39.223 --> 17:40.556
Catch you later man.

17:40.558 --> 17:42.793
I better catch my ride
before she leaves.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.330
I just know it's gonna
be a fun drive home.

18:43.989 --> 18:45.990
Mom, Dad?

19:54.259 --> 19:55.191
Vic?

19:55.193 --> 19:56.728
What are you doing down here?

20:00.632 --> 20:02.433
Vic, can you hear me?

20:05.871 --> 20:06.838
Vic!

20:10.442 --> 20:12.443
Abadon, Abadon, Abadon...

20:14.078 --> 20:15.213
Vic!

20:16.781 --> 20:18.448
Glen.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.985
Sorry about that.

20:39.704 --> 20:41.405
Morning, sunshine.

20:48.512 --> 20:50.779
Do you even have any memory of

20:50.781 --> 20:53.284
the events that took
place last night?

20:54.185 --> 20:56.920
What are you talking about?

20:56.922 --> 20:58.787
I didn't think so.

20:58.789 --> 21:00.489
I'm actually not surprised.

21:00.491 --> 21:03.060
I've never seen anyone
sleepwalk the way you did.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.096
Sleepwalking?

21:07.098 --> 21:09.833
Okay, I've never
done that in my life.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.901
I think it was you
who was dreaming, bro.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.203
Oh no my dear, no.

21:14.205 --> 21:16.773
You see, I would love to
say that I dreamt this up,

21:16.775 --> 21:18.110
but you?

21:19.611 --> 21:22.144
Were definitely sleepwalking.

21:22.146 --> 21:24.280
You actually woke me up
you were being so loud.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.882
You know how hard that is.

21:25.884 --> 21:27.816
I can sleep through anything.

21:27.818 --> 21:29.786
Mom and Dad didn't wake up.

21:29.788 --> 21:30.953
Lucky you.

21:30.955 --> 21:32.322
I'm sure if you
would've woken Mom up,

21:32.324 --> 21:34.493
you would have no
problem remembering it.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.827
Okay, well I really
don't remember any of that!

21:38.829 --> 21:41.699
But even if I did, I'm
sure you deserved it.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.574
I'll be honest
with you though.

21:51.576 --> 21:55.212
Sleepwalking or not, you
scared me last night.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.051
Sorry.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.690
Oh my god.

22:07.692 --> 22:10.427
All right man,
take care, all right?

22:10.429 --> 22:12.027
- Hey, come on!
- See you next week.

22:12.029 --> 22:14.331
Come
on Mark, let's go.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.298
Hey dude, you okay?

22:16.300 --> 22:17.600
Yeah, I'm okay man.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.670
But like I was saying
in there, the girl,

22:20.672 --> 22:22.171
you know the girl I'm
supposed to meet with?

22:22.173 --> 22:23.840
She likes me man!

22:23.842 --> 22:25.909
She also wants to
have sex with me,

22:25.911 --> 22:28.010
but she also likes
me at the same time.

22:28.012 --> 22:29.478
- So I'm just like...
- Really?

22:29.480 --> 22:33.149
Yeah and all you wanna
do is take her home, right?

22:33.151 --> 22:34.517
Yeah, I wanna take her home,

22:34.519 --> 22:36.652
and I wanna do nasty things.

22:36.654 --> 22:38.354
Oh, god no!

22:38.356 --> 22:42.491
But the problem is, is
she wants a relationship.

22:42.493 --> 22:43.860
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.327
And I'm not a
relationship type of dude.

22:45.329 --> 22:48.565
But the thing is if she
wanted a no-strings-attached

22:48.567 --> 22:50.566
situation, I'm all in it!

22:50.568 --> 22:52.267
So now you're
saying you're not

22:52.269 --> 22:54.172
gonna try and have
sex with this girl.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.707
I'm not, well,
maybe if I was drunk.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.112
Yeah, what a coincidence!

23:01.512 --> 23:03.212
Yeah, I understand though,
so you would if you were drunk?

23:03.214 --> 23:04.480
Yeah, I would.

23:04.482 --> 23:06.716
I would smash that shit man.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.285
- And she got a big booty.
- Oh my god, Mark!

23:09.287 --> 23:11.755
I mean, fuck it,
but like I said,

23:11.757 --> 23:15.290
she wants a relationship, I
don't want a relationship, so...

23:15.292 --> 23:18.128
And I don't believe in
no-strings-attached situations

23:18.130 --> 23:19.929
because a girl will
always have feelings

23:19.931 --> 23:22.433
so like I said, motherfuckers...

23:23.734 --> 23:26.769
I don't want a relationship.

23:26.771 --> 23:29.405
Yeah, we get that,
we get that hon!

23:29.407 --> 23:31.775
Give it up already
man, you're drunk.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.242
Besides back there is where you

23:33.244 --> 23:34.777
told her to meet you, right?

23:34.779 --> 23:36.813
Our car is over here.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.815
You gotta turn around
and walk the other way.

23:38.817 --> 23:40.417
- Good luck my friend.
- Come on.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.817
It's that way, you'll be fine.

23:41.819 --> 23:43.385
- Good night Mark.
- Good night Mark.

23:43.387 --> 23:45.354
Y'all just gonna
kick me out like that?

23:45.356 --> 23:46.657
Good luck!

23:47.592 --> 23:48.660
Bye!

23:50.228 --> 23:51.827
- That was fun Sis.
- Yeah.

23:51.829 --> 23:53.796
Yeah it was, and hey,
we should do this again,

23:53.798 --> 23:56.799
but next time one of my
drunken friends can join us.

23:56.801 --> 23:59.134
Oh, I'm into that!

23:59.136 --> 24:02.372
Uh, you animal,
what about Kristen?

24:02.374 --> 24:03.305
Who?

24:03.307 --> 24:06.375
Oh broseph, you are awful!

24:06.377 --> 24:07.443
Yeah, I know.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.047
Hey Vic, stop stop stop.

24:10.515 --> 24:13.485
Last one to the car buys the
food on the way home, go!

24:15.220 --> 24:16.518
- I win!
- No fair!

24:16.520 --> 24:17.554
You cheated!

24:17.556 --> 24:18.688
Yeah well you're still

24:18.690 --> 24:19.825
buying the food on the way home.

24:34.972 --> 24:36.942
Just a couple
more minutes Martin.

24:43.414 --> 24:45.216
Pretzel with salt!

24:57.796 --> 25:00.198
- Here you go.
- Thanks Victoria.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.103
So, you are not gonna believe

25:07.105 --> 25:08.604
what she said to me last week.

25:08.606 --> 25:09.771
- Hey Joey.
- Seriously!

25:09.773 --> 25:11.675
This time it's off the charts!

25:13.144 --> 25:15.844
Let me guess, she's tired
of your troublesome antics,

25:15.846 --> 25:17.479
she wants a real man,

25:17.481 --> 25:19.582
she doesn't like the fact
that you live day to day,

25:19.584 --> 25:21.284
or that you have no money.

25:21.286 --> 25:22.485
Am I even close?

25:22.487 --> 25:24.053
Ha ha, not really.

25:24.055 --> 25:26.855
She actually accused me of
sleeping with somebody else.

25:26.857 --> 25:28.157
Can you believe that?

25:28.159 --> 25:29.726
I mean what in the hell
gives her the right

25:29.728 --> 25:31.861
to accuse me of cheating on her?

25:31.863 --> 25:32.996
She started the whole thing off

25:32.998 --> 25:34.396
by saying I was eyeing some girl

25:34.398 --> 25:35.965
while we were out at
dinner the other night.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.667
When all I was really
doing was minding

25:37.669 --> 25:40.169
my own business and eating
my chicken parmesan.

25:40.171 --> 25:41.571
Then, no no, then,

25:41.573 --> 25:43.506
she goes off on a
completely different tangent

25:43.508 --> 25:45.374
about me sleeping with said girl

25:45.376 --> 25:47.610
and ends the whole
thing by stomping out

25:47.612 --> 25:50.113
on me in front of the whole bar.

25:50.115 --> 25:53.082
I cannot believe the
nerve of that woman!

25:53.084 --> 25:55.651
- So did you sleep with her?
- No, of course not!

25:55.653 --> 25:57.353
She just assumes
I wanna sleep with

25:57.355 --> 25:58.921
every girl that catches my eye.

25:58.923 --> 26:01.157
Well can you blame her?

26:01.159 --> 26:03.593
I mean, look at
your track record!

26:03.595 --> 26:06.194
I am aware that you
are a changed man Joey,

26:06.196 --> 26:09.565
but you gotta make
sure she knows that!

26:09.567 --> 26:11.066
If you can't convince
her to be more

26:11.068 --> 26:13.736
secure in your relationship then

26:13.738 --> 26:16.405
you might as well
throw in the towel.

26:16.407 --> 26:18.874
Believe me, I would know.

26:18.876 --> 26:20.644
Yeah, you're probably right.

26:21.479 --> 26:23.081
Gotta prove it to her.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.153
So how are we gonna do that?

27:39.923 --> 27:42.093
Victoria, what's wrong?

28:07.419 --> 28:10.420
Hey, it's just after 11.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.691
You're not supposed to
be home for another hour.

28:16.894 --> 28:18.262
I'll be right back.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.669
Woah, are you all right?

28:30.541 --> 28:32.609
Have a bit of a
rough night, did we?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.353
Vic, what's wrong?

28:43.488 --> 28:45.287
I heard something
at work tonight.

28:45.289 --> 28:46.722
You heard something?

28:46.724 --> 28:48.658
There was a sound
in the closet.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.959
Calm down, you're
not making any sense.

28:50.961 --> 28:53.263
Glen please,
please listen to me.

28:54.132 --> 28:55.731
I was at work.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.567
And I heard this sound.

28:58.569 --> 29:01.071
Like a scratching noise.

29:02.673 --> 29:04.509
I opened the door...

29:06.911 --> 29:09.144
There was nothing there.

29:09.146 --> 29:10.981
There was nothing there!

29:12.983 --> 29:15.351
And then I heard this...

29:15.353 --> 29:17.219
Vic, Vic!

29:17.221 --> 29:20.256
You need to get some sleep Sis.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.357
You haven't been sleeping well.

29:22.359 --> 29:24.428
And this is because of that.

29:27.898 --> 29:30.399
Yeah. Yeah.

29:30.401 --> 29:32.670
You're probably right.

29:34.838 --> 29:35.807
I'm just...

29:36.708 --> 29:38.676
I'm just gonna go to bed now.

29:43.347 --> 29:44.548
Sis.

29:48.685 --> 29:50.686
What happened to your sister?

29:50.688 --> 29:53.191
Ah, she just needs some rest.

29:54.192 --> 29:56.292
Hey now mister, it is my turn.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.860
Who says you get the remote?

29:57.862 --> 29:59.528
Change the channel!

29:59.530 --> 30:00.632
Hey!

30:03.268 --> 30:04.333
Give it!

30:04.335 --> 30:05.436
Fine.

30:52.683 --> 30:54.917
Glen, wake up, come
on, let's get up!

30:54.919 --> 30:56.919
Vic, what the
fuck are you doing?

30:56.921 --> 30:58.086
Glen, come on, get up!

30:58.088 --> 30:59.490
There's someone outside!

31:00.458 --> 31:02.424
What are you talking about?

31:02.426 --> 31:04.192
I saw someone in
the park collapse

31:04.194 --> 31:05.661
and it looked like
they need some help.

31:05.663 --> 31:07.630
So would you please just get up?

31:07.632 --> 31:08.866
Come on!

31:10.101 --> 31:11.536
Christ!

31:13.037 --> 31:14.937
If this is a joke, I
am going to kill you!

31:14.939 --> 31:17.373
Seriously, I was having
a really good dream.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.007
Would you quiet down?

31:19.009 --> 31:20.276
You're gonna wake Mom and Dad!

31:20.278 --> 31:21.844
Oh, heaven forbid!

31:21.846 --> 31:23.511
Heaven forbid that
I wake Mom and Dad!

31:23.513 --> 31:24.815
Bite me!

31:27.018 --> 31:28.718
Come on Glen, move your feet!

31:28.720 --> 31:30.385
They could be in
serious trouble!

31:30.387 --> 31:32.354
Victoria you were
probably just sleepwalking.

31:32.356 --> 31:33.922
Or maybe you heard
another closet noise.

31:33.924 --> 31:35.792
Not a chance, I
know what I saw!

31:39.497 --> 31:43.365
So Vic, where is this mystery
person in need of our help?

31:43.367 --> 31:46.134
Because I don't see
anyone here but us.

31:46.136 --> 31:47.269
No.

31:47.271 --> 31:49.673
No no no, that's impossible!

31:50.741 --> 31:53.375
I, what is going on here?

31:53.377 --> 31:55.811
I saw them collapse right here!

31:55.813 --> 31:57.479
You didn't see anything Vic,

31:57.481 --> 31:58.680
you're going crazy.

31:58.682 --> 31:59.717
No!

32:00.652 --> 32:03.619
I am positive I saw someone!

32:03.621 --> 32:05.556
Don't call me crazy!

32:07.392 --> 32:08.625
Glen?

32:10.528 --> 32:12.029
Where are you?

32:14.231 --> 32:16.300
Glen, please come out!

32:18.135 --> 32:20.001
Glen I'm sorry I woke you up,

32:20.003 --> 32:21.538
please come out!

33:15.026 --> 33:17.095
- Hey buddy.
- Morning Dad.

33:18.229 --> 33:19.630
Late night last night?

33:20.798 --> 33:23.065
Not too bad, Kristen
went home pretty early,

33:23.067 --> 33:25.301
and I just sort of went to bed.

33:25.303 --> 33:27.937
Ah. Quick on the trigger, huh?

33:29.406 --> 33:30.540
Gross!

33:45.155 --> 33:46.921
Where is Vic?

33:46.923 --> 33:48.591
Oh, she's not awake yet,

33:48.593 --> 33:50.661
you wanna go down
and wake her up?

33:53.931 --> 33:55.165
Sure.

33:56.433 --> 33:57.835
No problem.

34:05.809 --> 34:08.277
Jesus Vic, did you
throw a party last...

34:10.280 --> 34:12.650
Holy shit, Vic
are you all right?

34:15.887 --> 34:17.054
Glen?

34:18.121 --> 34:20.223
Where did you go last night?

34:21.159 --> 34:22.860
What happened to you?

34:24.094 --> 34:26.295
What are you talking about?

34:26.297 --> 34:29.000
I didn't see you last
night after Kristen left.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.304
Did you have another nightmare?

34:35.907 --> 34:36.806
No.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.610
No, that can't be.

34:44.481 --> 34:46.516
Get away from me!

34:49.387 --> 34:50.554
Glen.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.322
I'm sorry!

34:54.925 --> 34:56.793
I'm so sorry.

35:06.570 --> 35:07.871
It's okay.

35:08.840 --> 35:09.941
It's okay.

35:39.269 --> 35:41.005
So where's your sister?

35:42.172 --> 35:45.374
She's not feeling well.

35:45.376 --> 35:46.641
I'm calling the club and letting

35:46.643 --> 35:48.711
them know she won't be in today.

35:48.713 --> 35:51.079
I just calmed her
down, she just,

35:51.081 --> 35:52.650
she just needs some rest.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.820
Should I go
check on her later?

35:59.289 --> 36:00.525
Yeah.

36:01.726 --> 36:03.427
Yeah, you should.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.813
Honey, were you
talking to somebody?

37:00.384 --> 37:02.652
No Mother, why?

37:16.400 --> 37:18.068
Nevermind.

38:00.677 --> 38:03.346
Oh my god honey, you
scared the hell outta me.

38:18.329 --> 38:20.061
Victoria.

38:20.063 --> 38:21.796
Are you all right?

38:21.798 --> 38:24.700
Yes Mom, I'm fine.

38:24.702 --> 38:25.970
Just tired.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.769
I'm going back to my room now.

39:00.170 --> 39:02.539
Let me give you some
medicine so you can sleep.

39:03.606 --> 39:04.974
No thanks.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.893
What is going on here?

39:56.860 --> 39:59.994
Why are you doing this to me?

40:33.164 --> 40:35.430
I'm so sorry you guys.

40:35.432 --> 40:38.601
It's okay honey, you're
just having a nightmare.

40:39.903 --> 40:42.271
I'm so sorry.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.642
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

41:32.822 --> 41:34.021
Vic!

41:34.023 --> 41:35.826
Christ, what the
hell are you doing?

41:37.961 --> 41:41.095
Glen, I can't
take this anymore.

41:41.097 --> 41:43.833
I don't deserve to
suffer like this!

41:45.902 --> 41:48.503
I don't know what's going on.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.540
I am losing it!

41:53.911 --> 41:55.546
Christ Vic.

41:57.447 --> 41:59.716
Come on, let's get you inside.

43:08.184 --> 43:09.920
Yeah, what's up?

43:17.695 --> 43:19.263
What's up Glen?

43:21.532 --> 43:24.535
- Let's go to the table.
- Okay.

43:41.418 --> 43:42.918
Bear in mind,

43:42.920 --> 43:44.885
this stuff I'm getting
ready to show you

43:44.887 --> 43:47.490
is a little disturbing.

43:49.059 --> 43:52.026
You'd be surprised how
much I can handle now.

43:52.028 --> 43:53.496
All right man.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.577
Okay so this is a girl
who's being treated

44:08.579 --> 44:11.579
with exorcisms in Costa Rica.

44:11.581 --> 44:14.717
I've been following her case
since she got diagnosed.

44:15.786 --> 44:17.452
It's pretty fucked up.

44:28.865 --> 44:30.097
So yeah man,

44:30.099 --> 44:31.666
you wanna tell me why
we're looking at these?

44:31.668 --> 44:33.401
Or where have you been
for the last few weeks?

44:33.403 --> 44:36.206
I mean, I haven't seen you
or Victoria in a while.

44:41.612 --> 44:43.747
There's something
I need to show you.

44:52.188 --> 44:53.523
Follow me.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.284
Yo, what's
wrong with her?

45:25.521 --> 45:26.889
Hello Mark.

45:30.094 --> 45:31.793
Hey Vic.

45:31.795 --> 45:33.731
How you doin' lately?

45:35.632 --> 45:37.467
Are you ready?

45:39.670 --> 45:41.769
Are you ready to see her?

45:41.771 --> 45:43.237
Your mother?

45:43.239 --> 45:45.875
Vic, be quiet, you
know his mom is gone.

45:47.043 --> 45:48.978
You will see her soon.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.481
Get off me!

45:52.648 --> 45:54.050
Fuck this!

45:54.918 --> 45:56.920
Dude, dude wait!

45:58.889 --> 46:00.691
Mark, Mark, wait!

46:08.465 --> 46:10.200
Mark, Mark!

46:13.003 --> 46:14.735
Dude, where are you going?

46:15.606 --> 46:16.871
Hey, dude, it's just me!

46:16.873 --> 46:19.740
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

46:19.742 --> 46:22.144
There's something seriously
fucked up with your sister,

46:22.146 --> 46:24.746
I'm not gonna be
involved with it.

46:24.748 --> 46:26.083
Get her help!

46:48.871 --> 46:52.442
Oh shit, oh, oh fuck!

47:06.489 --> 47:09.592
We have to get her
the hell out of here.

47:10.893 --> 47:12.661
She's not well, Dad.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.028
And the longer we keep her here,

47:14.030 --> 47:15.896
the worse it's gonna get.

47:15.898 --> 47:17.465
Mom keeps filling her with drugs

47:17.467 --> 47:18.934
but that's not gonna help!

47:18.936 --> 47:21.503
Don't be ridiculous Glen,
your mother is a doctor,

47:21.505 --> 47:23.637
she knows what she's doing.

47:23.639 --> 47:26.807
Now if your sister gets a good
night's sleep she'll be fine.

47:26.809 --> 47:28.409
But neither one of us
think it's necessary

47:28.411 --> 47:31.246
to drag her out of this
house and into a hospital.

47:31.248 --> 47:33.447
But what if you're wrong?

47:33.449 --> 47:34.950
Maybe we should get
a second opinion.

47:34.952 --> 47:36.251
I've seen this before!

47:36.253 --> 47:39.086
- Mark has shown me articles...
- Mark?

47:39.088 --> 47:42.090
So now this has become
a religious thing?

47:42.092 --> 47:44.860
You know how your mother and
I feel about that subject.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.162
Dad, I know how
insane this sounds,

47:47.164 --> 47:49.563
I am not an idiot!

47:49.565 --> 47:50.865
But something is wrong with Vic

47:50.867 --> 47:52.936
and neither you nor
Mom can help her!

47:54.403 --> 47:57.039
Well have you tried discussing
this with your mother?

47:58.809 --> 48:00.608
Of course not.

48:00.610 --> 48:02.077
I half expected
you to believe me,

48:02.079 --> 48:03.778
but I couldn't even
stand up to her.

48:03.780 --> 48:05.749
- She's as closed minded as a...
- Hey!

48:06.949 --> 48:09.150
Don't speak badly
about your mother.

48:09.152 --> 48:11.151
She knows what
she's talking about

48:11.153 --> 48:12.688
and that is that.

48:14.023 --> 48:15.757
Now don't you have
to go to work?

48:15.759 --> 48:17.327
You're gonna be late.

48:21.197 --> 48:23.999
Hope you're right, Dad.

49:18.855 --> 49:21.057
Hey Vic, what's up?

49:23.427 --> 49:25.028
Is that Glen's camera?

49:26.362 --> 49:29.630
Honey, that is a very
expensive piece of equipment,

49:29.632 --> 49:31.067
let me have that.

49:35.938 --> 49:37.173
Film me.

49:39.242 --> 49:41.775
Her name was Victoria.

49:41.777 --> 49:44.378
Her name was Victoria.

49:44.380 --> 49:47.783
Her name was Victoria.

49:49.119 --> 49:50.887
And she will die.

49:54.090 --> 49:55.724
Vic!

49:55.726 --> 49:57.092
Honey?

49:57.094 --> 49:58.726
Honey, what's going on?

49:58.728 --> 49:59.994
Are you all right?

49:59.996 --> 50:00.931
Vic!

50:27.990 --> 50:29.224
Hey Dad, you want anything?

50:29.226 --> 50:31.693
Beer, soda, better team?

50:33.463 --> 50:36.164
Big words from a guy
that roots for the Vikings.

50:36.166 --> 50:38.032
I can't believe out of all
the teams in the league,

50:38.034 --> 50:40.834
you actually chose
the Viqueens, really?

50:40.836 --> 50:42.037
Hey Brett Favre
is the greatest

50:42.039 --> 50:44.171
quarterback that ever lived.

50:44.173 --> 50:45.606
Yeah, sure.

50:45.608 --> 50:47.941
Just like Kobe could've
beaten Michael.

50:47.943 --> 50:49.244
You don't know what
you're talking about.

50:49.246 --> 50:51.545
Kobe could take Mike any day.

50:51.547 --> 50:53.549
Keep dreamin' Son.

50:56.952 --> 50:58.454
Thank you sir.

51:00.956 --> 51:02.690
To Favre and your Vikings.

51:22.179 --> 51:23.577
What is going on?

51:23.579 --> 51:24.880
Calm down.

51:30.554 --> 51:32.820
What the hell are you doing?

51:32.822 --> 51:35.190
I'm trying to fuck you, Daddy.

51:37.059 --> 51:39.726
I know that you've
been thinking about it,

51:39.728 --> 51:42.665
you can't deny that you want me!

51:43.867 --> 51:47.204
I'm right here, so take me!

51:48.338 --> 51:50.006
Jesus Christ.

52:18.335 --> 52:19.402
Hello?

52:25.641 --> 52:28.144
Mark, an accident?

52:31.081 --> 52:33.115
Thank you Mr. Russell.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.729
Okay, okay.

55:18.782 --> 55:20.115
Are you Glen?

55:25.454 --> 55:28.557
Yes, I called you
about my sister.

55:29.425 --> 55:30.925
All right.

55:30.927 --> 55:33.561
And you say you have not told
your family about this yet?

55:33.563 --> 55:37.331
No, no, my parents wouldn't
even consider believing me.

55:37.333 --> 55:38.700
Especially my mom,

55:38.702 --> 55:41.735
she has little
faith in religion.

55:41.737 --> 55:44.037
Your father, you said he
witnessed some of these events,

55:44.039 --> 55:45.407
what does he think?

55:46.675 --> 55:48.510
Probably the same as my mom.

55:52.248 --> 55:54.583
But I saw her that morning.

55:55.885 --> 55:57.921
And that was not my sister.

55:59.956 --> 56:02.892
There is something inside her.

56:04.494 --> 56:05.860
I know how crazy that sounds,

56:05.862 --> 56:07.461
and I'm sorry to put
this burden on you.

56:07.463 --> 56:10.664
But I honestly didn't
know where else to go.

56:10.666 --> 56:13.034
No, you did the right thing.

56:13.036 --> 56:16.639
This place is here for anyone
who needs its guidance.

56:18.041 --> 56:20.108
I don't know if your
sister is possessed

56:20.110 --> 56:21.945
or just very sick.

56:23.079 --> 56:25.949
But I can assure you
that, whatever the case,

56:27.150 --> 56:29.753
I'll do everything I can
for you and your family.

56:32.389 --> 56:34.157
Thank you Father.

57:07.090 --> 57:09.157
I left her right here.

57:09.159 --> 57:10.593
Where'd she go?

57:58.675 --> 58:01.641
Try it, I dare you!

58:01.643 --> 58:04.279
You'll lose and she will die!

58:06.181 --> 58:08.250
Tell me your name, creature.

58:11.954 --> 58:15.956
Abadon.

58:15.958 --> 58:19.427
You will fail, Priest!

58:23.833 --> 58:25.869
Let's get her to bed.

58:30.106 --> 58:31.472
Mom, please listen to me,

58:31.474 --> 58:34.208
what is happening to
Victoria is not natural!

58:34.210 --> 58:37.043
She is not psychotic and
she's obviously not insane!

58:37.045 --> 58:38.912
There is something
evil about her!

58:38.914 --> 58:41.148
Enough of this shit!

58:41.150 --> 58:42.849
Victoria needs medical attention

58:42.851 --> 58:45.519
and that is exactly what
we're going to get her.

58:45.521 --> 58:47.954
She's not possessed
by some demon,

58:47.956 --> 58:50.557
or presence.

58:50.559 --> 58:51.992
And the longer we
stand around here

58:51.994 --> 58:54.362
and argue about this the
worse it's gonna get!

58:54.364 --> 58:57.097
Mrs. Martin,
please, I implore you.

58:57.099 --> 58:58.900
Listen to your son.

58:58.902 --> 59:00.434
I don't think that
you or your husband

59:00.436 --> 59:03.405
understand how serious
this situation is.

59:04.574 --> 59:07.340
I believe your daughter
is under the influence

59:07.342 --> 59:09.911
of a demon who calls
himself Abadon.

59:09.913 --> 59:13.481
This vile creature is
known as The Destroyer,

59:13.483 --> 59:15.249
in the Book of Revelation
they consider him

59:15.251 --> 59:17.284
a plague on mankind.

59:17.286 --> 59:20.954
If we don't act quickly
with Victoria, we will not...

59:20.956 --> 59:25.293
Mr. David, you may have
convinced my son of this,

59:25.295 --> 59:27.561
devil presence in Victoria,

59:27.563 --> 59:31.298
but you're not gonna convince
us of this stupidity.

59:31.300 --> 59:33.733
- Susan, please.
- What?

59:33.735 --> 59:36.105
Have you talked to your
son about this crap?

59:37.539 --> 59:38.940
Don't you have an opinion?

59:38.942 --> 59:41.742
I don't know what to
think about it Susan,

59:41.744 --> 59:45.146
I've never seen Victoria
behave like this.

59:45.148 --> 59:47.648
Mom, it all makes sense.

59:47.650 --> 59:48.849
The word Abadon,

59:48.851 --> 59:50.184
the reason Victoria
has been acting

59:50.186 --> 59:52.586
the way she has
lately, everything.

59:52.588 --> 59:54.155
This ends here!

59:54.157 --> 59:57.157
We are getting her out of
here, this is ridiculous,

59:57.159 --> 59:59.161
we're taking her
to the hospital!

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.208
What are you doing?

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.309
Jesus, Dad, help me!

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:18.579
Before I lay me down to sleep

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:21.782
I pray the lord my soul to keep!

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:25.086
And if I die before I wake,

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:27.156
I pray the lord...

01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:30.492
My soul to take!

01:00:38.934 --> 01:00:40.268
Let's get her.

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:08.229
- Hey Susan.
- Hey.

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:09.729
Listen, the labs
came back negative,

01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:11.965
the best we can do is
hold her for 72 hours,

01:01:11.967 --> 01:01:14.401
but I can't really offer
much more than that.

01:01:14.403 --> 01:01:16.704
So you can't find
anything wrong with her?

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.139
Nothing.

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:20.141
That's insane, that's crazy!

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.541
I mean, there is
something wrong,

01:01:21.543 --> 01:01:22.976
she's my daughter
for Christ's sake,

01:01:22.978 --> 01:01:24.912
there is something
very wrong with her!

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.447
There's really
nothing we can do,

01:01:26.449 --> 01:01:29.184
but if you need anything,
just please, let me know.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.990
Victoria, honey.

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.159
How can I help you, honey?

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.696
How can I make this better?

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.009
Mommy?

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:07.717
Hi, I didn't mean to wake you.

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:12.155
Mommy, why are you crying?

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.292
Mommy.

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.595
Why are you crying Mommy?

01:03:22.164 --> 01:03:23.632
Victoria?

01:03:25.934 --> 01:03:28.635
Are you crying because of
what your daddy did to you?

01:03:28.637 --> 01:03:30.038
Is that it?

01:03:31.173 --> 01:03:33.072
What are you saying?

01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:35.876
Or rather, what he
did to your sister?

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.814
When he made her a whore!

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:42.385
Come here girls, this will
only hurt for a second.

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:47.054
Susie, please help me!

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:49.055
I don't want to get hurt!

01:03:49.057 --> 01:03:51.293
I don't want Daddy
to hurt me again!

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.563
How did you know?

01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:58.300
I'm still bleeding!

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:00.867
Susie?

01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:02.068
Wait!

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:04.003
Where are you going?

01:04:04.005 --> 01:04:06.375
Don't leave me alone with Daddy!

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.513
Please, help me!

01:04:35.737 --> 01:04:37.205
John, John?

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:40.474
Call Father David, hurry!

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:42.644
Please come quick, hurry!

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:52.454
Mom, Mom!

01:04:53.356 --> 01:04:54.921
Are you okay?

01:04:54.923 --> 01:04:57.557
I am so sorry, you were right!

01:04:57.559 --> 01:04:59.260
You were right.

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:01.095
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:04.432
Mom.

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:30.356
Father, please.

01:05:30.358 --> 01:05:32.525
Please help me.

01:05:32.527 --> 01:05:34.360
I will, my child.

01:05:34.362 --> 01:05:35.297
I will.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.805
Victoria...

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.378
I believe we need to
perform an exorcism.

01:05:51.313 --> 01:05:55.182
But I cannot do that
without the consent

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:57.353
of the person who is possessed.

01:05:58.253 --> 01:06:00.420
That's why I'm here tonight.

01:06:00.422 --> 01:06:02.690
I need your permission.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.791
You need my permission?

01:06:04.793 --> 01:06:07.628
Because there's a
chance I could die?

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.731
Right?

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:12.468
Yes.

01:06:15.737 --> 01:06:17.403
Of course.

01:06:17.405 --> 01:06:19.706
Of course you can.

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:22.976
Anything to get this,
this thing out of me.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.688
Go ahead and try it,
you fucking priest!

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.191
You really think you can
expel me, be my guest!

01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:39.228
I will rip you to pieces!

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.063
What's the matter Priest?

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.532
Scared?

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:50.740
No, creature it is
you who should fear me.

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:53.909
I'll never let you have her.

01:06:55.043 --> 01:06:57.711
Then by all means,
try to save her.

01:06:57.713 --> 01:07:01.650
In the end, I will be
laughing and she will be dead!

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:22.938
When I was just a child...

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:26.642
My father was part of a cult.

01:07:28.543 --> 01:07:31.980
They tried to raise the
demons from Hell and...

01:07:33.481 --> 01:07:35.483
And bring the dead back to life.

01:07:37.085 --> 01:07:38.651
We were kids, you know,

01:07:38.653 --> 01:07:43.257
my sister and I, we
pretended it didn't happen.

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:45.659
But my father would
come home when his

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.795
projects failed or...

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:50.063
His experiments didn't work out

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:52.901
and he would abuse
us and hurt us.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.405
He drove my mother away.

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.809
She killed herself
when I was six.

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.780
It didn't just kill
my sister and I but,

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.451
it also made him go insane.

01:08:09.717 --> 01:08:11.653
He didn't want us around.

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.992
We hated him for that.

01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:23.731
So when he died...

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:27.533
We just told ourselves
there couldn't be a God,

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:28.868
how could there be a God?

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.538
I mean, what God would
do this to our family?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.109
So...

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:38.113
We just, after that we
stuck together and...

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:43.216
We were there for each other.

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:45.121
And we didn't trust anybody.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.022
Did I...

01:08:50.024 --> 01:08:51.290
Did I do the right thing?

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.759
Was I wrong?

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.161
Did I do this to my family?

01:08:55.162 --> 01:08:56.331
No.

01:08:57.899 --> 01:09:00.166
Nothing you did was wrong.

01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:03.706
You're a good person,
a good mother.

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:09.645
God has a plan for all of us.

01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:14.015
I'm so sorry.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.151
Mom.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.885
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:25.993
I have to prepare
for tomorrow.

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:28.961
Glen, you should get some sleep.

01:09:28.962 --> 01:09:30.564
I'm gonna need you.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.808
I'm sorry it took an extra day,

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.243
but as you can imagine,

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:47.781
the Archdiocese is very careful
in matters such as these.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.982
But we have approval now.

01:09:49.984 --> 01:09:51.585
Victoria,

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.986
do you remember anything about

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:57.425
when or where this
evil first beset you?

01:10:00.895 --> 01:10:03.830
Yeah, it was over
there in the park.

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:06.502
And I thought I saw
this figure fall over.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.306
That night I thought
I woke you up.

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.381
Then that's where
we need to go.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:46.842
All right, everyone.

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:50.076
Do not go near Victoria.

01:10:50.078 --> 01:10:52.012
Do not talk to her.

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:53.513
Do not respond to
her in any way.

01:10:54.949 --> 01:10:57.517
Focus only on what I say.

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:59.052
Do only what I tell you.

01:11:00.488 --> 01:11:03.357
Victoria will not
be with us tonight.

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.527
We'll not be dealing
with a family member.

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:11.231
This thing can and will
hurt you if you let it.

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:12.333
Thing?

01:11:14.502 --> 01:11:18.106
As I said, Victoria will
not be with us tonight.

01:11:23.444 --> 01:11:25.544
In the name of the
Father, and of the Son,

01:11:25.546 --> 01:11:27.682
and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.084
God arises.

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.053
His enemies are scattered.

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:35.724
They're ready to
flee before him!

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:40.162
- Glen, stop!
- Glen!

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:45.967
Time to join Mark!

01:11:52.006 --> 01:11:54.840
As smoke is driven
away, so are they driven.

01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:56.610
As wax melts before the fire,

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:59.014
so the wicked perish
at the presence of God.

01:12:00.114 --> 01:12:01.916
Leave her demon!

01:12:03.618 --> 01:12:05.451
Go fuck yourself and die!

01:12:05.453 --> 01:12:06.753
Die Priest!

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.889
We drive you from us,

01:12:09.891 --> 01:12:12.025
whoever you may be,
unclean spirits.

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:14.827
All Satanic powers,
all infernal invaders,

01:12:14.829 --> 01:12:17.865
all the wicked legions,
assemblies and sects!

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.568
Leave this child now, Abadon!

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:25.807
Knowing my name will do
you little good, Priest!

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.522
Most cunning serpent,

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:45.025
you shall no more dare to
deceive the human race,

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.195
- persecute the Church...
- Die!

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.062
And sift them as wheat!

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:55.568
The most high God commands you,

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:57.370
He with whom, in your insolence,

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:59.473
you still claim to be equal.

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.844
Leave this servant of our Lord!

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:05.614
Leave this servant
of our Lord, Abadon!

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:22.030
Put down the boy!

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.268
Abadon, release the
boy immediately!

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:28.535
All right, Father,

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.706
I'll make you a deal!

01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:34.273
Victoria, put him down!

01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:38.146
I'll release the girl if you
kill this worthless maggot!

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:41.048
I will not take a life!

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.517
That's too bad!

01:13:49.323 --> 01:13:50.826
Glen!

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.728
What happens now, Priest?

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:57.597
Who'll be next to die?

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.367
May you be snatched
away and driven

01:14:01.369 --> 01:14:02.635
from the church of God.

01:14:02.637 --> 01:14:03.937
And from the souls
made to the image

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.171
and likeness of God.

01:14:05.173 --> 01:14:06.440
And redeemed by
the precious blood

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.874
of the divine lamb.

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:09.976
The most high God commands you!

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.812
He with whom in your insolence

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:14.246
you still claim to be equal!

01:14:14.248 --> 01:14:17.951
Leave this child of God
immediately, Abadon!

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.718
Shut the fuck up!

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.754
Behold the cross of the Lord!

01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:23.522
Flee bands of enemies!

01:14:23.524 --> 01:14:25.157
The Lion of the tribe of Juda,

01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:27.693
the offspring of
David, hath conquered!

01:14:27.695 --> 01:14:30.129
Leave her now, Abadon!

01:14:30.131 --> 01:14:33.301
Leave this child of God!

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:44.210
Daddy?

01:14:44.212 --> 01:14:45.112
Vic!

01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:47.748
Is it over?

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.151
Yes.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.488
Yes it is.

01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:57.590
You're all right Sweetie.

01:14:57.592 --> 01:14:59.659
You're okay.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.674
Just tryin'
out my sweet new camera!

01:16:21.676 --> 01:16:25.144
Come on, say something
interesting, Vic.

01:16:25.146 --> 01:16:26.312
Oh Glen!

01:16:26.314 --> 01:16:28.382
Oh come on man,
don't leave me hanging!

01:16:29.283 --> 01:16:31.319
I guess it's just me now.

01:16:35.056 --> 01:16:38.961
I would have never expected
things to turn out like this.

01:16:41.095 --> 01:16:43.130
It's like it's
some big nightmare!

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.132
And I'm gonna wake up.

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:50.939
And you'll be there with your
stupid camera in my face.

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:59.245
But Glen, if I could
do it all over again,

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:02.451
I would gladly trade
my life for yours.

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:08.990
But you just had to go
and steal the spotlight.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:13.860
I doubted your ability
to protect me and...

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.329
You proved me wrong.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.470
I will never doubt you again.

01:17:25.306 --> 01:17:27.041
I love you Glen.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.893
How are you doing?

01:17:50.765 --> 01:17:52.366
I'm all right.

01:17:56.203 --> 01:17:57.605
I guess now I just,

01:17:59.073 --> 01:18:01.275
I just have to go out and
see the world and just...

01:18:02.743 --> 01:18:05.646
Just really enjoy this chance
at life that I've been given.

01:18:09.216 --> 01:18:10.784
That way I'll have
plenty of stories

01:18:10.786 --> 01:18:13.020
to share next time I see him.
