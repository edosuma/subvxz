for five days now.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.222
Look, there's something you
should know about your bird...

00:44.348 --> 00:45.295
Oh, no.

00:45.461 --> 00:47.260
I just got a clue in the case of

00:47.385 --> 00:50.096
whether or not that new Thai
restaurant gives you the runs.

00:50.221 --> 00:51.964
It does. Case closed!

You see, Lorraine, your bird is...

How... how do I put this?

Please find her.

No, no, no, no, don't-don't cry.

Thank you, Mr. Wheels.

01:16.033 --> 01:18.591
Out of TP in there, Bonkers,
so I had to use

01:18.716 --> 01:20.517
the corner of your Ferrari poster.

I just couldn't break it to her.

You think this fake detective
agency with real cases

01:37.101 --> 01:39.479

your father's garage is a joke?!

01:39.604 --> 01:41.214
I just hate upsetting people.

01:41.339 --> 01:43.499
Breaking bad news is
part of the job, Wheels.

01:43.624 --> 01:45.751
It's a part of life.
You got to do it.

01:45.876 --> 01:48.525
That's why I volunteer at

01:48.691 --> 01:50.569
You're all going to die.

01:50.735 --> 01:54.197

Did you know that megaphone
takes 12 D batteries?

01:57.488 --> 02:00.183
I know. I had the same look when
I first opened the compartment.

02:00.308 --> 02:02.251
Could stick my whole fist in there.

02:02.376 --> 02:04.878
No, that's not
what she said, Bonkers.

Not much.

How's your big
three-day weekend going?

02:33.791 --> 02:35.268
Good. Good.
Exciting.

02:35.393 --> 02:36.969
Exc... Too exciting.
Had to take a break.

02:37.094 --> 02:38.394
Not a young man.

02:39.163 --> 02:41.340
So, you guys, you guys are
doing something with Klaus, huh?

02:41.465 --> 02:43.676
We're gonna take pictures of
him to submit to Cute Pet Pics.

02:43.801 --> 02:45.945
Want to help?

02:46.070 --> 02:48.605
Guess I'll go try on hats
in the garage.

02:54.895 --> 02:58.307
Extry, extry, read all about it.

02:58.432 --> 03:00.026
My grandfather
always claimed

03:00.151 --> 03:01.827
I would inherit a secret fortune.

03:01.952 --> 03:04.130
But when he died, all he left me

03:04.255 --> 03:07.123
was this one mysterious key.

03:09.146 --> 03:11.938
I don't have any money
to pay you, but if you find out

03:12.063 --> 03:14.820
what this key opens, you can
have half of whatever's inside.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.393
Wow, that sounds like a fun journey.

03:17.518 --> 03:19.328
Here's your chance to give some bad news.

03:19.453 --> 03:21.660
Tell this kid to hit the bricks.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.866
Listen, you look like
a nice kid and all,

03:23.991 --> 03:25.458
but we're not gonna be able to...

03:27.373 --> 03:29.605
... take our eyes off your sweater.

03:30.698 --> 03:31.857
Is it soft?

03:31.982 --> 03:33.859
Can I wear it without
a T-shirt under it,

03:33.984 --> 03:35.444
you know, how black guys
sometimes wear sweaters?

03:35.569 --> 03:36.779
Fail!

03:36.904 --> 03:38.802
Beat it, Sweet Charity;
we're not taking your case.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.471
Please. This key is
my grandfather's legacy.

03:41.637 --> 03:44.053
Uhp, "legacy."

03:44.178 --> 03:45.454
Fine, we'll take the case.

03:45.579 --> 03:47.623
You're lucky you said a word
with "leg" in it.

03:47.748 --> 03:48.958
It's my only weakness.

03:49.083 --> 03:51.460
That's how I got this
Foghorn Leghorn key chain

03:51.585 --> 03:53.613
and this bag of legumes.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.036
I just hate making people sad.

04:05.202 --> 04:07.610
You're a pushover, but I don't
have time to discuss it,

04:07.735 --> 04:10.212
because I have to
push out some green curry.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.415
Yes, I tried the Thai restaurant again.

04:12.540 --> 04:14.383
It's called giving a place
a second chance,

04:14.508 --> 04:16.375
and it burns like hell.

detective stuff looks fun.

10:20.525 --> 10:23.539
well, the agency is
going through some changes.

10:23.705 --> 10:25.917
Ah, you mean like getting rid
of that dumb bear?

10:26.191 --> 10:27.951
Dad, I don't know how to say this...

10:28.076 --> 10:29.686
My name is Nate, I'll be your server.

10:29.811 --> 10:30.988
How are we this evening?

10:31.113 --> 10:32.423
Nate, this evening, I'm proud.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.175
Are you a father, Nate?

10:34.341 --> 10:36.928
Because in some ways,
I'm two fathers.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.012
There's Stan and Steve,

10:38.253 --> 10:40.431
and then Pappa Wheelie
and his son Wheels.

10:40.689 --> 10:43.267
So... do you like music?

10:43.392 --> 10:44.802
Do I like music?

10:44.927 --> 10:48.272
No, no, I'm the one person
on Earth who doesn't like music.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.274
Why did you answer my ad online

10:50.399 --> 10:51.842
if you were just gonna ignore me?

10:51.967 --> 10:53.777
My profile has four pictures of me

10:53.902 --> 10:56.096
staring out of a restaurant
window through binoculars.

10:56.221 --> 10:57.865
You knew what this was.

11:00.617 --> 11:03.754
Nice job.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.672
Listen, Dad, about the agency...

11:05.797 --> 11:07.040
Oh, I love it so much.

11:07.165 --> 11:08.275
It's so fun.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.827
Plus I get to spend time with you.

11:09.952 --> 11:10.962
What could be better?

11:11.128 --> 11:12.964
Um, well...

11:13.222 --> 11:14.799
Yes?
You're...

11:16.967 --> 11:18.969
Getting a top-secret assignment.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.320
I'm ready!

11:20.445 --> 11:23.190
Look, we need you to become our...

11:23.315 --> 11:26.243
um, our... our-our
head key researcher.

11:26.368 --> 11:28.145
But you gotta...
you gotta do it

11:28.270 --> 11:29.613
deep, deep undercover.

11:29.738 --> 11:31.849
Like... like, don't
even tell The Legman.

11:31.974 --> 11:35.185
Now, I need you to go to
the library every day.

11:35.310 --> 11:37.988
Find out everything there
is to know about keys.

11:38.113 --> 11:39.282
Okay, I can do this.

11:39.514 --> 11:41.993
You start now.
Get out of here.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.095
Oh, one more thing.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.165
You know how <i>Moonstruck</i>
is your favorite Cher movie?

11:47.389 --> 11:50.334
Uh, yes, I think I know
my favorite Cher movie.

11:50.459 --> 11:53.103
Want to reenact the "snap out
of it" scene before you go?

11:53.228 --> 11:54.404
Sure. Can you read me in?

11:54.529 --> 11:55.506
No problem.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.481
I'm in love with you.

12:00.218 --> 12:02.889
Snap out of it!

12:05.357 --> 12:07.201
Good for him, huh?

12:07.326 --> 12:09.486
You know, you're not
as ugly as I thought.

12:09.611 --> 12:10.971
I just might sex you later.

12:11.096 --> 12:12.606
I'm gonna go.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.942
Ugh. Now you've ruined it by talking.

12:17.669 --> 12:19.213
Ugh. Terrible date last night.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.657
I only made her "O" like 100 times.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.083
You know...

12:23.208 --> 12:24.452
you know what I'm saying,
right, Bonks?

12:24.676 --> 12:26.954
Hey, this place has got
some breathing room, huh?

12:27.079 --> 12:29.656
I can't believe you
actually fired Pappa Wheelie.

12:29.781 --> 12:31.892
Yep. He's a-gone.

12:33.452 --> 12:34.837
Wheels and The Legman.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.197
Steve, it's Mom.
Have you seen your father?

12:37.322 --> 12:38.815
I don't know who this Steve is.

12:38.940 --> 12:40.534
Is this about a case?

12:42.227 --> 12:45.038
Wheels, have you seen Pappa Wheelie?

12:45.163 --> 12:46.807
He didn't come home last night.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.975
That's weird.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.310
Let me get back to you.

12:50.986 --> 12:52.412
Teddy, can you...
Oh, never mind.

12:52.537 --> 12:55.137
You're waiting for that
fax confirmation.

12:57.459 --> 12:59.477
Package for Wheels and The Legman.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.076
A severed finger.

13:06.401 --> 13:07.945
"We have your associate."

13:08.070 --> 13:09.446
Dad!

13:09.571 --> 13:10.814
"If you want him back alive,

13:10.939 --> 13:12.950
"we will trade him for the key.

13:13.075 --> 13:16.295
3:00 at the abandoned bank
on Norton Street."

13:16.461 --> 13:17.588
Oh, my God!

13:17.754 --> 13:19.048
We gotta get goin'!

13:28.357 --> 13:30.067
Eventually we'll have
to go back inside

13:30.192 --> 13:32.502
and have a serious talk about
what we're going to do.

13:38.942 --> 13:40.535
It's Stan's finger, all right.

13:40.660 --> 13:42.804
I recognize the ring.

13:42.929 --> 13:44.489
How did this happen?

13:44.614 --> 13:46.325
We're not even real detectives.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.327
Someone wants that key bad.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.612
But why would anyone
do this to Pappa Wheelie?

13:50.737 --> 13:52.540
He wasn't even working
for us anymore.

13:52.706 --> 13:53.849
I...

13:54.227 --> 13:55.846
- I didn't fire him.
- What?!

13:56.026 --> 13:57.402
Oh, this is all my fault.

13:57.527 --> 13:58.637
Somebody must have followed him

13:58.762 --> 13:59.955
to the library and nabbed him.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.923
We have to call the cops, Roger.

14:02.048 --> 14:03.225
It's Legman!

14:03.350 --> 14:05.052
And we are taking care
of this ourselves.

14:05.218 --> 14:06.461
They want the key, right?

14:06.586 --> 14:08.296
But who's to say
that once we give it to them,

14:08.421 --> 14:09.798
we actually get your dad back?

14:09.923 --> 14:12.868
We need to find out what
the key unlocks and get that.

14:12.993 --> 14:14.569
Then, if they try to pull a fast one,

14:14.694 --> 14:16.438
we have the key and the goods.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.706
We have all the leverage.

14:17.831 --> 14:19.441
I... I don't...
I don't know, Roger.

14:19.566 --> 14:20.809
I'm scared.

14:20.934 --> 14:23.111
No. Steve Smith is scared.

14:23.236 --> 14:27.249
Squwirt "Wheels" Cinnabun has
danglers the size of Montana.

14:27.374 --> 14:30.276
Anyone can crack this case, he can.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.665
Squwirt Cinnabun?

14:34.831 --> 14:36.425
Yeah.
I Keyser Soze'd you

14:36.550 --> 14:38.700
off the top of that file cabinet.

14:42.255 --> 14:44.499
Oh, great.
You guys again.

14:44.624 --> 14:47.202
Our vulgar associate is no
longer with the company.

14:47.327 --> 14:48.670
We came to say we're sorry.

14:48.795 --> 14:50.772
And to find out what you know
about this key.

14:50.897 --> 14:52.541
Okay, I'll tell you,

14:52.666 --> 14:54.276
but I'm running a business here.

14:54.401 --> 14:55.677
You'll have to buy something.

14:55.802 --> 14:57.403
I got this.
You have a scanner?

15:05.362 --> 15:07.156
And send.

15:07.322 --> 15:10.733
And I'll also take
this off-season Santa pen.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.479
The key opens a locker
at the train station.

15:14.604 --> 15:15.680
How did you know that?

15:15.805 --> 15:17.049
Because it's printed on the key.

15:17.174 --> 15:18.717
Here's the train station address,

15:18.842 --> 15:20.118
and here's the locker number.

15:20.243 --> 15:22.387
And here's a phone number
in case you find this key.

15:22.512 --> 15:24.589
And below that,
this is just a hotline number

15:24.714 --> 15:27.550
should you have any general
questions about the key.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.365
Do you remember
where we parked the car?

15:33.490 --> 15:35.101
'Cause I don't.
We're in E-4.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.468
Look at you.

15:36.593 --> 15:39.371
You're like that autistic
cowgirl Claire Danes played.

15:39.496 --> 15:41.339
Do you know she's an "A" cup?

15:41.464 --> 15:43.358
Hey, there are the lockers.

15:43.483 --> 15:46.153
I know so much about celebrities.

15:56.621 --> 15:58.974
We are up against a deadline, people,

15:59.099 --> 16:01.343
and not one of you
has submitted a photo

16:01.468 --> 16:04.880
that's close to cute enough
for Cute Pet Pics.

16:05.121 --> 16:06.414
My peepaw did not start

16:06.539 --> 16:08.700
an underground cute newspaper in 1943

16:08.825 --> 16:11.036
to have it all go to hell
'cause you morons

16:11.161 --> 16:13.848
can't tell your elbow
from a kitten in a bunny suit!

16:14.014 --> 16:15.223
I'm sorry, Peepaw.

16:15.348 --> 16:17.609
I think we're going to have
to shut her down.

16:17.734 --> 16:19.277
Um, sir, I do have

16:19.402 --> 16:21.079
this submission from Langley Falls.

16:21.204 --> 16:22.397
Let me see that!

16:22.522 --> 16:23.965
Oh, my God.

16:24.090 --> 16:27.235
Carol, you may have
just saved the world.

16:27.402 --> 16:28.603
Is he serious?

16:28.728 --> 16:31.157
I... I never know
what's going on here.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.544
Hi. I'm calling
from Cute Pet Pics.

16:35.669 --> 16:37.746
Uh, we have a submission
from this address,

16:37.871 --> 16:40.215
and with permission, we'd like
to publish it on the site.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.460
Oh, my God, yes!
Yes! Yes!

16:42.742 --> 16:45.086
Francine, Hayley,
get in here, bitches!

16:46.513 --> 16:48.290
Time to see some cute...

16:48.415 --> 16:49.615
What the...?!

16:52.552 --> 16:53.829
That's not a hippo's butt.

16:53.954 --> 16:55.897
That's Roger's fat alien ass.

16:56.022 --> 16:57.766
I'd know it anywhere.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.062
Many times I've woken up to that
ass hanging over <i>mein</i> bowl.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.438
Wow, Klaus, I guess Roger's ass
is cuter than you.

17:03.563 --> 17:04.772
Dick.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.808
Yeah, Dick Vermeil.

17:06.933 --> 17:09.077
I won a ring
with the Rams.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.155
Flipped it on you, bitch.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.048
I flipped it on them.

17:13.173 --> 17:16.050
Oh, they will go upstairs,
they will Google Dick Vermeil,

17:16.175 --> 17:19.310
and they will know
how bad I nailed them.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.692
This is the spot.
Now, where's Stan?

17:23.817 --> 17:25.961
There's a note in the pneumatic tube.

17:27.554 --> 17:29.831
"Send in the key,
and Pappa Wheelie is yours.

17:29.956 --> 17:31.199
We are watching."

17:31.324 --> 17:33.993
They can have the key.
We already have the bag.

17:37.197 --> 17:39.433
Whoa, that sucks really good.

17:39.599 --> 17:44.179
You think anyone's ever...
done stuff with it?

17:44.304 --> 17:46.748
Should I do stuff with it?

17:46.873 --> 17:49.985
Do we have time for me
to do stuff with it?

17:50.151 --> 17:52.721
If I do stuff with it
and stuff goes wrong,

17:52.846 --> 17:54.305
will you help me?

17:54.430 --> 17:55.991
Oh, wait. There he is.

17:56.157 --> 17:57.826
Dad! We're coming for you!

17:57.951 --> 17:59.961
How do we get in there?
I have an idea.

18:00.086 --> 18:02.206
Quick, grab my disguise
kit out of the trunk.

18:08.111 --> 18:09.521
Dad, what happened?

18:09.646 --> 18:10.722
It's Bonkers.

18:10.847 --> 18:12.724
I know, this whole thing
is just bananas.

18:12.849 --> 18:14.960
No, it's Bonkers... Teddy Bonkers.

18:15.085 --> 18:16.887
He did this.
He's behind you.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.383
He had it out for me the whole time.

18:21.508 --> 18:23.251
He gave me the wrong
coffee order for Roger.

18:23.376 --> 18:24.970
He encouraged my smart-mouth persona,

18:25.095 --> 18:26.538
knowing full well it would bomb.

18:26.663 --> 18:28.323
Bonkers wanted me fired,
and when that didn't happen,

18:28.448 --> 18:29.692
he wanted me dead.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.109
What?

18:31.234 --> 18:32.410
Oh, my God.
Of course!

18:32.535 --> 18:34.246
Bonkers was jealous that you came in

18:34.371 --> 18:35.413
as a junior detective

18:35.538 --> 18:37.349
when he was next in line
for a promotion.

18:37.474 --> 18:38.951
Oh, Bonkers.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.993
How could you do this?

18:42.612 --> 18:44.372
Oh, for the love of God, Roger.

18:44.497 --> 18:46.508
Bonkers is not real!

18:46.633 --> 18:47.976
What?
What are you saying?

18:48.101 --> 18:50.829
Bonkers is a stuffed bear... a toy!

18:50.954 --> 18:53.131
I didn't want to tell you,
but I hate this bit!

18:53.256 --> 18:55.176
Here's why... it's stupid!

18:55.392 --> 18:57.035
A teddy bear as our receptionist?

18:57.160 --> 18:58.637
It doesn't even make sense.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.598
Do you know how many calls
we've missed?

19:00.764 --> 19:02.157
But, Steve...

19:02.282 --> 19:04.726
I went along with it 'cause
I didn't want to upset you.

19:04.851 --> 19:06.294
I can't stand telling people

19:06.419 --> 19:08.830
things they don't
want to hear, but...

19:08.955 --> 19:10.098
Hey.

19:10.223 --> 19:11.833
Why, I did it.

19:11.958 --> 19:13.861
I told someone bad news.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.304
But if Bonkers isn't real,

19:16.429 --> 19:19.231
then who kidnapped Pappa Wheelie?

19:20.867 --> 19:22.210
It was you.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.288
You framed Teddy Bonkers.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.047
It's true.

19:26.172 --> 19:27.699
I knew you wanted to fire me.

19:27.824 --> 19:29.067
Yes, I knew.

19:29.192 --> 19:31.202
So I figured,
if I made Bonkers the bad guy,

19:31.327 --> 19:32.837
I could blame all my mistakes on him

19:32.962 --> 19:34.339
and you'd give me another chance.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.665
But I made one miscalculation.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.544
I never thought Steve
would have the guts

19:39.669 --> 19:41.388
to tell you Bonkers was fake.

19:41.554 --> 19:43.114
The only thing I don't get

19:43.239 --> 19:45.226
is why you went to all this trouble.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.634
I was bored, Steve.

19:46.759 --> 19:48.169
Really, really bored.

19:48.294 --> 19:49.688
Like, so bored.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.473
So you cut off your own finger?

19:51.598 --> 19:52.974
That wasn't my finger.

19:53.099 --> 19:55.460
It was a fish stick I sucked
the bread crumbs off of.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.864
I thought there was something
fishy about all this, Legman.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.406
No, I'm not playing without Bonkers!

20:03.076 --> 20:04.235
You know what?

20:04.360 --> 20:07.572
It's not so bad being
the "bear-er" of bad news.

20:07.697 --> 20:10.975
Or the sharer of new shoes.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.344
You're fired.

20:12.469 --> 20:14.779
Whoo! That felt great!

20:14.904 --> 20:16.715
I gotta keep this goin'!

20:16.881 --> 20:19.385
Your bird is dead.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.036
Your grandfather was an idiot.

20:21.161 --> 20:23.288
His legacy... an empty satchel

20:23.413 --> 20:25.933
that lights up when you open it!

20:26.099 --> 20:27.977
You're not cute.

20:28.284 --> 20:30.437
<i>I'm telling you,</i> <i>a girl's friends</i>

20:30.603 --> 20:32.897
get in her ear, it is over.

20:33.022 --> 20:35.734
They're all, "Make him
take you to a restaurant.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.268
Make him buy you sandals."

20:37.393 --> 20:38.970
I don't care what every single person

20:39.095 --> 20:42.950
on Earth says... you're hilarious.

20:43.950 --> 20:45.829
Sync.
