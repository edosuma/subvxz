Time travel anywhere,

worry about timepieces or
portal days.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.689
I'll have to trick them to
use it before tey can.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.957
Don't try anything
funny.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.492
<i>I just hope Lena can blend</i>

00:59.526 --> 01:01.261
Thea only looks out
for herself.

01:01.294 --> 01:06.700
She's not gonna beat me.
-We have to destroy everybody.
Especially Little Miss Perfect.

01:19.212 --> 01:23.817
(Lena and Ines
singing and
laughing)

01:26.687 --> 01:30.591
Today is the last day
to impress Ms Carré before
the mid-season show.
-Uh-hm.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.259
Which part do you want
the most? Pairs or the solo?

01:33.860 --> 01:37.430
Well, I'd say
solo, but I'd take
either.

01:37.463 --> 01:41.768
I really want pairs.
-Oh... (teases) Cause you want
to be paired with Max!

01:41.802 --> 01:45.539
No, I don't!
-I never got the whole Max
thing anyway.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.273
There's a "Max
thing"?

01:49.009 --> 01:53.213
"Hey, chica. I'm
mysterious and brooding and
I've got loads and loads of
secrets!"

01:53.246 --> 01:58.552
OK. Stop. Seriously.
This could be my last chance
to dance on the Garnier stage.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.253
You don't know
that.

02:00.286 --> 02:04.758
I don't know when, but
Henri is coming at some
point to take me back to
1905, so...

02:05.458 --> 02:07.493
(Thea) Room check.
-(Bree) Check.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.631
Don't check my check.
Just tell me that it's done.
-Check.

02:10.664 --> 02:15.536
Don't. Not today.
Magazines hidden?
Devices stored?
-Check.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.237
(exhales
nervously)

02:17.538 --> 02:20.874
(Ines and Lena giggle) That
is a whole new level of
Thea.

02:20.907 --> 02:25.879
Oh, just you wait.
Her mother comes every year
to watch the selection for
mid-season show

02:25.912 --> 02:30.450
and Thea loses her
mind. Fasten your seat belt.
-(giggles)

02:30.951 --> 02:35.388
Seat belt?
-Like a car seat belt?

02:35.421 --> 02:37.658
Oh, OK. (Both
laugh)

02:41.762 --> 02:43.129
(Lena and Ines
laugh)

02:43.163 --> 02:49.736
Whoa! Take it easy.
Don't you want to be light on
your feet today?

02:49.770 --> 02:52.606
(with full mouth) Yeah. I
know Ms Carré is casting the
showcase.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.609
But why would I act any
different today than any
other day? Hm?

02:57.578 --> 02:59.412
(chuckles)

02:59.780 --> 03:02.583
Um, so, where is
everyone?

03:03.316 --> 03:07.253
By everyone, do you

Nice try,
Jeffrey. Let's get
started.

04:08.081 --> 04:12.986
How you perform will
determine your role in the
mid-season show.

04:13.019 --> 04:15.922
Pairs: Ines and
Dash.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.592
Let's do
this. I'm in it to
win it.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.462
(Ms Carré) Max and
Thea. Lena and Jeff.

04:22.495 --> 04:25.966
Oh no.
-Hey, I heard that!

04:25.999 --> 04:30.504
(Ms Carré) ...Emma
and David. Alice and Sacha.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.878
Wooh! Yeah!
Oh!

04:37.911 --> 04:42.816
OK, wow, that's so
great. But can we get started
now? Please?

04:42.849 --> 04:47.654
Oh yeah! L to the E to the N
to the A. What does that
spell?

04:47.688 --> 04:53.093
Lena. It spells Lena,
Jeff. (Fake laugh) Totally
hilarious. As usual.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.327
Let's start with the
lift.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.496
(Jeff) Argh.
OK.

04:57.097 --> 05:01.735
(tickling noises)
-(Lena laughs) Jeff! Come on.
Get serious.

05:01.768 --> 05:05.939
I'm totally serious.
You're the one who's laughing.
(Sighs) OK.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.441
(Lena
laughs)

05:08.474 --> 05:11.745
I am begging you to
stop! This isn't funny!

05:12.513 --> 05:15.481
This may be my only
chance to do this and I'm not
going to let you ruin it.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.752
Only chance?
Dramatic much?

05:18.785 --> 05:22.388
I mean, dancers only get
a few chances. This is one.
Come on.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.359
OK. (Inhales
deeply)

05:27.060 --> 05:30.463
Ahhh! (Lena laughs) Jeff!
No!

05:30.496 --> 05:34.367
We're going
partying. We're out!
-No! Jeff, put me down!

05:34.400 --> 05:36.537
Goodbye!
-(screams)

05:40.607 --> 05:42.475
(Thea) So here is
how it's gonna go
down.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.746
I've texted you a meditation
technique for people like
us.

05:46.613 --> 05:51.451
People like us?
-Winners! It'll sync our minds
and give us the edge. Give me
your phone.

05:58.158 --> 06:01.995
(phone beeps) It's a
brain teaser app. Use it or
lose it.

06:02.028 --> 06:07.400
Yoga. Not gonna lie,
yoga bugs me. But we're going
to do it because every second
counts!

06:07.934 --> 06:12.739
(sighs) Thea, I know your
mum's intense, but this is a
bit much.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.608
If we're not
rehearsing, we're meditating,

06:14.641 --> 06:16.610
if we're not
meditating, we're working
out.

06:16.643 --> 06:20.647
Yeah, I got it.
Babe... you need to
chill.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.483
Chill? There will
be no chilling!

06:23.517 --> 06:25.118
(Kennedy) The
student lounge shines.

06:25.151 --> 06:28.655
And we put gold stars
around your name on the
events board.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.492
(Thea) We have fifteen
minutes to get as relaxed as
possible.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.598
Yoga
up!

06:38.832 --> 06:40.834
I'll
pass.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.539
(Max) I'll catch you
later.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.575
At least do a brain teaser!
-(Max) Yes, Ma'am.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.443
Get
out!

06:50.744 --> 06:54.180
(teases) No! You get
out! (both giggle)

06:54.214 --> 06:55.481
OK...

06:57.751 --> 07:02.055
(Lena) I can't get Jeff
to focus for more than thirty
seconds.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.626
Dash, would you run
through the choreo with
me?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.193
Only if my partner doesn't
mind.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.995
As if I'd
mind. Why would I
mind?

07:09.029 --> 07:11.632
Maybe you don't want
Lena cutting into our
rehearsal time.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.701
(Ines) Whatever. Cut away.
-(Lena giggles)

07:14.735 --> 07:19.740
OK, help me out. How do I get
Jeff to take this seriously?

07:20.273 --> 07:24.210
(Dash) You know how he gets
weird under pressure and
pretends not to care?

07:24.244 --> 07:27.748
He totally cares so he
acts like it's not a big
deal.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.784
But it is! Actually a huge
deal.

07:31.217 --> 07:35.889
(Dash) But you got to make
him think it's not. Make him
feel like you're just playing
around.

07:36.857 --> 07:41.728
Even better: Make him
think you're breaking
rules.

07:41.762 --> 07:47.901
OK... I think I have
some ideas. Thank you.
-(Both chuckle)

07:48.702 --> 07:52.238
(video game
noises)

07:55.909 --> 07:59.279
Hey... I thought you
wanted to just go back to
rehearsing.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.850
Oh that? Whatevers...
evs.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.824
Whoops...

08:11.958 --> 08:16.262
Hey! Let's go break
into the dining hall for a
snack.

08:17.698 --> 08:21.602
We don't have to break
in. It's right over there, it's
open.

08:23.203 --> 08:29.843
Oh yeah. Well, what
about breaking into Studio C?

08:30.343 --> 08:33.980
It's locked. We could
rehearse in there like
rebels.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.717
What is with you
today?

08:37.584 --> 08:41.021
Nothing. Nothing at
all.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.292
(Jeff) Oh,
yeah, Mom's coming
today.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.673
H'm. Oh. Time for
pairs class.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.583
Oh yeah. I'll meet
up with you later.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.962
(Lena) Thank
goodness.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.198
Hey! Whoa!
-I didn't think you were going
to make it.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.802
Ah, pfff! Come on,
L. Back off. We got this.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.705
(Max) Come on, we need
to practice the lift.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.742
(classical piano music
plays)

09:37.944 --> 09:39.045
(Thea)
Oh...

09:43.283 --> 09:44.484
(Thea)
Sorry.

09:44.518 --> 09:48.021
That's not even close.
OK. Let's walk through it
again.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.591
And Ines, point your
toes, OK? They're offending me.

09:51.725 --> 09:56.730
(Etienne) It's one...
and extend and lift. Lift!
Lift! Lift! Lift!

09:56.763 --> 10:00.133
Come on, Thea, that
means you have to be in the
air!

10:01.334 --> 10:02.769
(sighs)

10:03.336 --> 10:06.172
(Jeff sighs)
-(Thea gasps)

10:06.206 --> 10:10.744
What is this? Some sort of
joke? You fell out of that
lift.

10:10.777 --> 10:17.718
Stand up straight,
Dorothea. This isn't the
circus, it's the Paris
Opera Ballet School.

10:17.751 --> 10:18.852
Hello,
Mother.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.857
(Jan) Why are you standing
there? Get back into that
studio until you get it
right.

10:25.358 --> 10:29.395
At least you're not them. Come
on, let's go. You too, Max.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.133
(Lena gasps)
-(Jan) You won't make Company
with that abysmal lift.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.902
(Ines) Wow...
-(Lena) Well, she's right. We
were terrible.

10:35.936 --> 10:39.072
Oh, come on, L. You know
I like to run fast and loose
with the rules.

10:39.105 --> 10:40.874
I like to walk on
the edge.

10:40.907 --> 10:46.379
(Lena) Yeah and...
make your own schedule. Or
do exactly what you're not
supposed to do.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.783
You know me so well.
(All laugh)

10:49.816 --> 10:53.386
I have a surprise for
you. Come on.
-For meeee? OK.

11:20.380 --> 11:24.384
(Lena) It's a
rehearsal. Isn't it
exquisite?

11:25.285 --> 11:29.756
It's OK. The girl's
pretty good. The dude could
lighten up a little though.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.026
It's kinda boring.
-Seriously?

11:33.059 --> 11:36.162
I sneak us into
a rehearsal and you
call it boring?

11:36.797 --> 11:38.565
I mean, it is nice,
but...

11:38.599 --> 11:43.136
I risked everything
to sneak us in here because
I thought it would inspire
you, Jeff.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.972
And you're just...
bored?

11:46.840 --> 11:49.776
Sort of...
sorry.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.965
Wow. Is there a yogurt shortage?
A pineapple drought?
-(Dash chuckles)

12:12.432 --> 12:17.037
(Lena) This is a
motivational dinner. A
dinner that inspires hard
work and dedication.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.372
So how's it going
with rehearsals?
-I've tried everything.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.510
Why can't you rally
behind me like you did for Max
and the Blok?

12:23.544 --> 12:26.847
(Jeff) Whoa. What's with
all these outrageous
demands and accusations?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.315
Let's take this down a
notch. Right, guys?

12:29.349 --> 12:32.252
I'm with her.
-You gotta do the
work, bro.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.121
(Ines) I could never
be like Lena. She's got the
patience of a saint.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.424
Yeah, I mean, we tried
to help her figure out how to
motivate you, but...

12:38.458 --> 12:41.528
(Jeff) Wait. You... you
talked to them about me?

12:42.028 --> 12:45.298
I was just trying to help,
Jeff.
-(scoffs) Yeah, sure.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.101
Jeff...

12:51.037 --> 12:54.941
(Jan) The reason why
I didn't make Company was
because of an injury.

12:54.975 --> 13:00.346
But Thea, she has my
genes, and my ambition.
(Chuckles) Don't you?

13:02.015 --> 13:05.351
See how focused she
is? I said, don't you, Thea?

13:05.952 --> 13:07.020
Yes,
Mother.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.057
(Max sighs, clears his
throat)

13:12.993 --> 13:18.431
Excuse me, Mrs Raphael,
would you mind if I steal
Thea? We need to rehearse.

13:19.065 --> 13:22.969
Oh, I like to see you
working so hard. Go on,
then.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.453
I thought you
said we were gonna
rehearse.

13:41.187 --> 13:44.257
We should rehearse.
She's probably following us
with binoculars.

13:44.290 --> 13:50.330
Trust me, babe. This will
make you feel better. You can't
let her get to you.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.032
You don't get
it...

13:56.269 --> 14:00.507
She took a second job
when I was eight years old to
pay for ballet class.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.614
I didn't even
want to be a dancer.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.384
I wanted to be
a skateboarder.

14:11.985 --> 14:16.389
Really? You have
never told me that
before.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.962
I can picture you on a
pink skateboard though.
-(giggles)

14:23.029 --> 14:29.169
I never got the chance.
It was easier to just... give
in.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.473
But it turns out I
love ballet.

14:35.441 --> 14:39.145
Well, that's a relief.
Because I can't attest for
your skateboarding skills,

14:39.179 --> 14:43.083
but your
ballet, I guess, is
alright.

14:43.449 --> 14:50.123
(chuckles) Thanks, Boo.
That means a lot.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.333
Where is everybody? I
thought this was a meeting for
the Blok.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.903
I just said
that to get you here.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.509
No! Listen. I'm sorry I
went to Dash and Ines for help,
but I didn't know what else to
do.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.544
You're not
taking this seriously.

15:10.577 --> 15:15.381
Imagine if I didn't
take hip-hop seriously. I can
do this because of you.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.452
Ta-ta-ta.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.123
Bend your right
leg.

15:23.557 --> 15:27.961
No, I don't feel like
it. I'm just gonna go play
some TV action games.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.330
OK! I get
it.

15:33.066 --> 15:37.337
Close your eyes. Dance to
the beat of your heart.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.343
(bursts out
laughing)

15:45.111 --> 15:52.118
I'm sorry, L. This
just isn't me. This is!
(imitates beating heart)

15:53.253 --> 15:56.523
I've had it! Why are
you even at this school?

15:56.557 --> 15:58.692
Oh, come on,
L!

16:03.697 --> 16:06.032
Thanks for your help,
girls.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.969
(both)
Sorry...

16:17.778 --> 16:22.348
Oh. I've reorganized your
room. What have I told you
before about clutter?

16:23.049 --> 16:25.351
"You're the boss of
clutter, not the other way
around."

16:25.385 --> 16:27.453
So you do
remember?

16:29.289 --> 16:32.726
What have you done with
my stuff? My posters? My
pictures...

16:32.759 --> 16:36.763
You mean the wall of
distraction? I threw it
all out so you can focus.

16:36.797 --> 16:40.734
(door opens) Oh!
Thea, there you are.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.536
Where else would I
be?

16:42.569 --> 16:45.739
Who just waltzes
into somebody's room
without knocking?

16:45.772 --> 16:49.510
I'm sorry. But,
we have that thing.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.277
What thing? What
thing?

16:52.546 --> 16:56.482
Uh... That dance thing.
You said you'd meet me in my
room.

16:59.185 --> 17:06.693
Right! She needs tons of
practice, 'cause she's
really behind.

17:06.727 --> 17:08.361
Well, there's
no need for
insults.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.130
(Jan) Where do you
think you're going?

17:10.163 --> 17:13.199
(Thea) Sorry,
Mother. School comes
first.

17:15.836 --> 17:20.340
Good evening, Mrs
Raphael. A true pleasure to
meet you and my apologies for
the disruption.

17:20.774 --> 17:22.275
Pfff.
-Pfff!

17:22.308 --> 17:23.409
(gasps)

17:26.146 --> 17:30.751
(ticking clock,
magical
tinkling)

17:34.487 --> 17:36.523
(Frank) We need this
portal to work, boys.

17:36.557 --> 17:40.594
It gives us the freedom to
travel whenever and wherever
we want.

17:40.627 --> 17:44.097
(hammering)

17:46.266 --> 17:48.068
(Pinky
groans)

17:48.101 --> 17:52.606
There's a crucial part
missing to finish this
portal. Without it, there's
no time travel.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.340
Is this
it?

17:55.241 --> 17:56.442
(metal
clanking)

17:56.476 --> 18:01.214
No! We're missing the
piece that actually makes
it work.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.721
Gonna make this
easy on you, mate.

18:09.155 --> 18:12.793
What, you talking to me?
-I don't have time for your
smart remarks right now, Henri.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.961
So where is it?
-Where is what?

18:14.995 --> 18:18.632
The missing piece! The
part of the blueprint you
haven't told us about.

18:18.665 --> 18:24.871
The piece of the puzzle
that makes this whole thing
work! Where is it?

18:25.539 --> 18:31.344
Are you being serious? You
think I'd sabotage my only
chance to get to Lena?

18:31.377 --> 18:33.179
That is
stupid.

18:33.213 --> 18:37.350
(Pinky) Oh...
(whispers) You wanna take
that back, now.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.152
What did you just call
me?

18:39.185 --> 18:43.489
OK, gents. Let's settle down.
I don't think he meant that
literally, Boss. How could he?

18:43.524 --> 18:47.427
He was being ironic on
account of you being so
smart, weren't you, Henri?

18:47.460 --> 18:52.465
Yeah. I don't know
any more than you do.
Sorry.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.637
(ticking clock,
magical
tinkling)

19:01.274 --> 19:05.178
(giggles) I'm willing
to bet if both our mothers
were in the same room,

19:05.579 --> 19:10.584
the world would explode.
(Giggles) I mean you should
have seen the look on her face!

19:12.285 --> 19:15.255
There's a trick to
getting Jeff to do what you
want, you know.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.224
What is it? I'll
try anything.

19:20.426 --> 19:24.931
Jeff's like a puppy.
If you tell him what he
needs instead of how
important it is,

19:24.965 --> 19:28.569
he'll deliver.
Just, stick to the
facts.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.571
Oh...
Thanks.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.342
(Ines) Did the world
end? Are zombies coming?

19:36.843 --> 19:38.745
Hilarious. Be
nice.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.583
Thea's going to stay here
until we're sure her mother's
gone back to the hotel.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.885
(Ines) Okay,
Dorothea.

19:50.256 --> 19:51.925
(whispers) It was
literally an emergency.

19:52.559 --> 19:58.298
So. Should we all go and
make cupcakes now? Yeah?

20:06.006 --> 20:10.010
Fact. We can do
this. Fact. The lift needs
work.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.646
Fact. You need to be on
my right after the second count
of eight.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.348
Fact. Hair washing
once a month is
necessary.

20:15.381 --> 20:19.820
Once a month?
That's gross. That's not
even a fact.

20:19.853 --> 20:24.290
Well, it was a fact
in 1905. Which is totally
gross. (Nervous laugh)

20:24.758 --> 20:27.928
OK... I'll
play your little
game, L.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.998
Fact. I've been a
jerk.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.468
Fact. So have I.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.104
You freaked me out.

20:38.138 --> 20:41.675
I know. Sorry about the
whole Dash and Ines thing. I
should've just talked to you.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.745
You did. I didn't
listen.

20:44.778 --> 20:48.515
Hey... Fact. We
have 38 minutes to
rehearse.

20:48.549 --> 20:51.484
And, if we run, we'll
beat Dash and Ines to the
studio.

21:06.967 --> 21:12.005
No, not like
that. Like I showed
you.

21:18.512 --> 21:21.682
(Jan sighs) No... let
me do it.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.518
I'll meet you in
there, OK?

21:28.354 --> 21:31.525
Ms Carré! It's a
big day, isn't it?

21:32.092 --> 21:34.661
The role you land
today, determines your
future.

21:34.695 --> 21:38.832
If this isn't
perfect, you risk making
Company.

21:38.865 --> 21:44.738
Mrs Raphael.
-Ms Carré. What a privilege.

21:44.771 --> 21:49.743
I'm so pleased to see
you. Do you have a few minutes
to meet with me in my office?

21:50.110 --> 21:55.081
It would be an honor. (to
Thea) Pointes. Bun. Stretch.

21:58.719 --> 22:02.455
I don't mean to be rude, but
I have thirty very nervous
students

22:02.488 --> 22:05.726
waiting to perform for
me, so I'll make this
brief.

22:05.759 --> 22:09.429
Is there something I
can do to help? You are aware
I have a ballet background, I
assume?

22:09.896 --> 22:13.700
This may come as a
shock to you, but we're not
here to talk about you.

22:13.734 --> 22:18.639
I may not be Thea's
parent, but I am the person
who looks after her on a daily
basis.

22:18.672 --> 22:22.809
I know she's been off
her game the whole time I've
been here. Please let me talk
to her.

22:22.843 --> 22:25.011
She's off her
game because you're
here.

22:25.712 --> 22:30.383
She's gone from a
confident student to a
nervous wreck. You need to
let her work.

22:31.051 --> 22:33.386
I'm only trying to do
what's best for my
daughter.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.756
Then I suggest you
leave.

22:43.797 --> 22:47.133
(clock ticking,
magical
tinkling)

22:55.509 --> 22:58.111
(Henri) Come on. We
have to try something. I need
to get to Lena.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.580
(Frank) I'll say
when it's worth
trying.

22:59.613 --> 23:01.648
OK. No, I'll say
when it's OK.

23:01.682 --> 23:02.816
I said OK.
-No, I will!

23:02.849 --> 23:04.985
(Clive) Oh no. Not
again.

23:13.093 --> 23:16.496
(classical piano music
plays)

23:43.724 --> 23:45.425
(Ms Carré)
Tss...

23:48.261 --> 23:50.564
(Thea exhales
nervously)

23:51.164 --> 23:53.634
Thank you. Next group.
-(Lena squeals)

24:00.073 --> 24:05.746
(Jeff sings
indistinctly) (Lena
laughs)

24:08.782 --> 24:11.652
Thank you for taking
me to the rehearsal.

24:11.685 --> 24:14.721
I didn't mean to force
you to like everything that
inspires me, you know.

24:14.755 --> 24:18.725
But it was amazing!
It just... freaked me
out.

24:18.759 --> 24:23.163
After what we just did,
I get that thrill you're
always talking about.

24:23.196 --> 24:26.867
I have to thank you
for that. You did that, L.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.635
(laughs
excitedly)

24:35.275 --> 24:37.978
I found these.
-You just found them?

24:38.011 --> 24:41.948
Yep. In a store. Where
I paid money for them. (Both
chuckle)

24:41.982 --> 24:45.051
Relax. Yellow ones
mean friendship, I looked it
up.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.722
I just wanted to say
that this has been a lot of
fun.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.223
This
conversation?

24:51.958 --> 24:56.496
Yes, this conversation.
I bought you flowers in
anticipation of this fun
conversation.

24:57.097 --> 25:00.166
I mean, your sarcasm is
getting better.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.938
Yellow ones also mean
undying love, intense
emotion.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.107
Don't ruin it.
-Whatever, Ines.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.117
(Jan) I'm sorry I left
without saying
good-bye.

25:17.150 --> 25:20.654
Perhaps my history as
a ballerina has thrown
you off your game.

25:21.655 --> 25:25.992
I felt it best to leave
you be. Fondly, Mother.

25:26.026 --> 25:28.294
(cries)

25:39.740 --> 25:42.976
(sniffles)

25:44.144 --> 25:47.614
(Ines) I got the solo!
I got the solo! (Laughs)
-Yes!

25:50.083 --> 25:51.852
I'm sorry you
didn't get the solo.

25:51.885 --> 25:55.789
Oh, that's... that's
fine. Trios... That's fine.

25:58.191 --> 26:01.194
Yes! Pairs. Tia is gonna
be so happy!

26:04.330 --> 26:06.700
Tia? It's
Max.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.301
(gasps)

26:09.402 --> 26:11.772
You got the pairs! With
Max!

26:12.172 --> 26:14.875
(Jeff) And I'm the
understudy! This is all
thanks to you, L.

26:15.208 --> 26:21.882
With Max? I mean... yay!
Yay! (Laughs, then
gasps)

26:23.817 --> 26:26.820
I'm Lena's
understudy.

26:28.388 --> 26:31.191
Don't even speak to me.

26:32.793 --> 26:34.260
(Ines
laughs)

26:35.862 --> 26:37.998
Hey! So I guess
we're working
together.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.203
I'll catch you later.
-OK.

26:44.337 --> 26:46.773
(Ines) You might
want to rein that in.

26:47.908 --> 26:49.910
I'm just smiling
because I got the
part.

26:49.943 --> 26:52.378
Yeah. Keep
telling yourself that.

26:52.412 --> 26:55.115
It's true.
-(copies) "It's true."
