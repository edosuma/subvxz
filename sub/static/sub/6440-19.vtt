00:22.450 --> 00:24.577
Justin.

00:25.319 --> 00:27.844
I just thought I'd stop by
and say goodbye.

00:28.022 --> 00:31.753
I heard you were going
back to Smallville tomorrow.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.290
Yeah, Smallville.

00:36.564 --> 00:37.963
How's it going?

00:46.807 --> 00:48.741
You tell me.

00:50.277 --> 00:53.576
You've been here five months.
You've come a long way.

00:53.748 --> 00:55.841
Your body has done a lot of healing.

00:56.384 --> 00:59.046
Except for my hands.

01:00.855 --> 01:03.289
They'll never get better
and I'll never draw again...

01:03.457 --> 01:06.517
...and that's the only thing
I was ever good at.

01:06.694 --> 01:11.529
You suffer severe nerve damage. It's
lucky you have movement in your hands.

01:11.699 --> 01:14.463
- I did everything I could, you know that.
- Really?

01:14.635 --> 01:19.299
Is that what you told the five patients
who filed malpractice suits against you?

01:19.473 --> 01:22.567
Now, I can understand
your still being angry...

01:22.743 --> 01:25.177
...but blaming me isn't
gonna change your condition.

01:25.346 --> 01:28.543
You were in an accident
and you have to accept that.

01:28.716 --> 01:30.877
I was in a hit-and-run.

01:32.353 --> 01:36.346
You know, when I was your age,
I wanted to be a violinist.

01:36.524 --> 01:40.858
So I applied to the Conservatory,
but I failed the audition.

01:41.028 --> 01:44.691
The instructor told me
that I had the hands of a surgeon...

01:45.299 --> 01:47.859
...and that's why I moved into medicine.

01:48.035 --> 01:50.265
As one door closes...

01:50.438 --> 01:53.271
...another one opens.

01:53.707 --> 01:57.108
You're young,
you'll find something new.

01:58.646 --> 02:01.012
Goodbye, Justin.

02:05.453 --> 02:07.751
Have a nice life, Dr. Wells.

02:10.324 --> 02:13.350
Rene, honey, I'm sorry.

02:13.527 --> 02:16.826
- Another ungrateful patient?
- Aren't they all?

02:16.997 --> 02:20.990
- So you think he'll sue?
- He doesn't have any proof.

02:21.168 --> 02:25.104
He's alive, he should be thanking me.

02:35.816 --> 02:37.477
What's going on?

02:48.829 --> 02:50.694
You okay?

02:54.668 --> 02:58.001
Get us out of here! Hurry up! Come on!

03:00.107 --> 03:03.474
Get us out of here now. Get us
out of here now! Hurry up! Come on!

03:06.547 --> 03:08.310
- Help!
- Help us!

03:10.284 --> 03:11.945
That's it.

03:12.119 --> 03:15.054
- Give me a hand up.
- All right.

03:37.711 --> 03:40.077
Okay, grab my hands.

05:03.730 --> 05:06.358
I see you in a uniform flying.

05:06.533 --> 05:09.229
Have you ever considered
a career in the Air Force?

05:09.403 --> 05:11.769
I'll think about it.

05:15.342 --> 05:17.242
What are you smiling about?

05:17.411 --> 05:20.903
I landed a summer job at Mayor Siegel's
working on his re-election campaign.

05:21.081 --> 05:23.311
I thought you were helping
your mom at the court.

05:23.483 --> 05:27.010
Judge Ross can get some KSU
students to schlep her files.

05:27.187 --> 05:29.747
Who wants to hang out with
their parents all summer?

05:29.923 --> 05:31.914
- Yeah.
- Sorry, Clark.

05:32.092 --> 05:35.186
Did you notice Kwan's son
down at the Air Force booth?

05:35.362 --> 05:39.230
Growing up with Kwan,
the Air Force would seem like Club Med.

05:39.533 --> 05:42.832
- Wow, you look nice.
- Thanks, I was going for professional.

05:43.003 --> 05:46.905
<i>Did you know the Daily Planet only takes
four high school interns from the state?</i>

05:47.074 --> 05:49.065
- You're a shoo-in, Chloe.
- Tell him that.

05:49.242 --> 05:52.234
He said they received
over 500 applicants last year.

05:52.412 --> 05:55.313
<i>- I doubt I'll get an interview.
- There's always the Inquisitor.</i>

05:55.482 --> 05:58.383
<i>- Didn't Lex offer to hook you up?
- I'm interning at the Planet.</i>

05:58.552 --> 06:00.850
I don't care if it's delivering coffee.

06:01.021 --> 06:03.854
Why don't you try again Saturday
when you're in Metropolis?

06:04.024 --> 06:06.720
Why are you going to Metropolis?

06:08.595 --> 06:10.893
We're going to Metropolis, Clark.

06:11.064 --> 06:13.828
The student journalism conference?

06:14.001 --> 06:18.131
You were supposed to sign us up. I know
you didn't forget. It's too late to get in.

06:18.305 --> 06:22.799
Sorry. I've been at the Talon all week
with Lana working on a history project.

06:22.976 --> 06:26.434
- Everything else becomes less important.
- Whoa, that's not true.

06:27.948 --> 06:30.576
How much time have we spent
together in three weeks?

06:30.751 --> 06:34.016
- We see each other every day.
- It was 45 minutes. My car broke down...

06:34.187 --> 06:36.417
...outside the Talon
and you gave me a ride home.

06:36.590 --> 06:40.219
- I had to tear you away from Lana.
- Don't you think you're being unfair?

06:40.394 --> 06:43.192
No! Whenever Lex and Lana are around,
no one else exists.

06:43.530 --> 06:46.931
Wait, Chloe, why are you being
so hypersensitive?

06:47.100 --> 06:52.629
Most men are from Mars, but you're from
a distant galaxy I've never heard of.

06:54.041 --> 06:56.635
I know I screwed up, but why is
Chloe having a breakdown?

06:56.810 --> 07:00.268
- You're not the most observant person.
- What are you talking about?

07:00.447 --> 07:05.578
She wanted to spend a day with you. She
was gonna ask you to the spring formal.

07:05.752 --> 07:07.583
Yeah, but that'd be like...

07:07.754 --> 07:09.745
Date?

07:10.290 --> 07:14.522
Maybe if you took off your Lana
blinders, you'd realize Chloe likes you.

07:22.169 --> 07:24.694
Clark, I'm not interested in an apology.

07:24.871 --> 07:28.102
- Not the welcome I was expecting, hi.
- Hey!

07:28.275 --> 07:30.869
How are you? It's good to see you.
When did you get back?

07:31.044 --> 07:35.481
Yesterday. I just wanted to thank you,
by the way, for sending all those emails.

07:35.649 --> 07:40.245
- They got me through a tough time.
- I'm sure lots of people kept in touch.

07:40.420 --> 07:43.685
For most of my friends,
it was out of sight, out of mind.

07:43.857 --> 07:47.190
I know the feeling. So when can you
start drawing your cartoon again?

07:47.360 --> 07:51.763
Everybody's been waiting for the further
adventures of the flaming crow's feet.

07:56.136 --> 07:58.434
Unfortunately my drawing
hand's kind of shot.

07:59.272 --> 08:02.298
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

08:02.776 --> 08:06.268
I'm in the process
of re-evaluating my life.

08:08.381 --> 08:12.681
So listen, is there any chance that
maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee...

08:12.853 --> 08:16.345
...or one of those nonfat,
no-foam lattes that you like?

08:20.527 --> 08:25.191
Yeah, why not? I'm in the process
of re-evaluating my life too.

08:29.736 --> 08:31.101
Let's go.

08:57.664 --> 08:59.655
What are you doing here?

09:01.868 --> 09:05.395
I'm here for the same reason you are.

09:06.373 --> 09:11.003
- The anniversary of her death.
- It's been nine years.

09:11.478 --> 09:13.639
Why the sudden burst of sentimentality?

09:13.980 --> 09:16.642
I deserve that, just disappearing
from your life.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.911
I'm sure all that LuthorCorp stock
my mother left you helped.

09:20.086 --> 09:22.714
Is that what your father told you?

09:24.191 --> 09:26.921
All those years I thought you loved me.

09:28.662 --> 09:30.994
But you were just in it for the money.

09:32.799 --> 09:37.896
I know you're angry and you have
every right to be, but we need to talk.

09:40.540 --> 09:44.203
I can't believe there's anything
you'd say that would interest me.

09:46.079 --> 09:48.070
Goodbye, Pamela.

09:56.823 --> 09:58.347
This one's my favorite strip.

09:58.525 --> 10:00.083
- Really.
- Yes.

10:00.260 --> 10:01.659
Hey, guys.

10:01.828 --> 10:03.557
- Hey.
- You know Justin.

10:03.730 --> 10:07.029
Yeah. Of course, welcome back.
How are you feeling?

10:07.200 --> 10:11.261
Oh, just kind of taking it
one day at a time.

10:12.072 --> 10:13.903
Did they find the driver who hit you?

10:14.074 --> 10:18.135
No. No, I couldn't give the police much. I
didn't remember anything for a long time.

10:18.511 --> 10:20.638
Well, what do you remember?

10:21.314 --> 10:24.977
- A little bit of the license plate. DDI.
- Well, we should look into it.

10:25.151 --> 10:28.052
- Call the police.
- If we find something, we'll pass it on.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.516
Okay.

10:35.562 --> 10:38.827
Anyway, I talked to Lex. He scored us
two tickets to the conference.

10:39.199 --> 10:42.396
Don't worry about it. Justin's
signed up so I'm going as his guest.

10:42.669 --> 10:45.160
- Yeah, or we could all go together.
- No.

10:46.239 --> 10:49.208
Clark's not that interested
in journalism anyway.

10:51.544 --> 10:55.275
Right, okay. I should probably
get going, listen-

11:07.694 --> 11:09.457
Thank you.

11:17.804 --> 11:19.999
- Hi.
- Hey, Clark. Is your mom around?

11:20.173 --> 11:23.870
- I wanted to order more of her pies.
- She's in class, I can help you.

11:24.044 --> 11:27.104
I thought you'd be helping
Chloe proof the latest edition.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.647
- She had enough help.
- Are you two still fighting?

11:30.817 --> 11:32.717
Who said we were fighting?

11:32.886 --> 11:37.823
Kind of caught it yesterday at the career
fair. What's going on with you two?

11:39.492 --> 11:41.153
Chloe likes me.

11:42.295 --> 11:44.388
So how do you feel about her?

11:45.498 --> 11:48.092
Like maybe we could be
more than friends.

11:50.437 --> 11:53.929
- I saw her with Justin. I got kind of-
- Jealous?

11:55.508 --> 11:58.966
It's like you find out this secret
and it colors everything.

11:59.813 --> 12:02.304
Just can't believe I never saw it before.

12:02.782 --> 12:07.481
Sometimes the right person can be in
front of your eyes and you never know.

12:15.996 --> 12:20.092
- So how many pies did you want?
- A dozen.

12:22.569 --> 12:25.561
How's Whitney?
I hear his dad's feeling better.

12:26.506 --> 12:28.497
He's great.

12:30.076 --> 12:31.703
Everything okay?

12:32.946 --> 12:34.379
Never better.

12:37.584 --> 12:40.951
Good luck. I hope things
work out with Chloe.

12:42.689 --> 12:44.213
Me too.

12:44.791 --> 12:46.190
Bye.

13:14.821 --> 13:16.448
Damn it.

14:03.503 --> 14:05.368
Pete.

14:05.539 --> 14:07.632
- Hey.
- Hey, you seen Chloe?

14:07.808 --> 14:11.437
Not since English. She's probably
hanging out with Justin.

14:12.979 --> 14:16.745
- What do you think about that guy?
- He seems pretty cool.

14:16.917 --> 14:21.081
Never got to know him that well before,
he was always buried in a sketchpad.

14:21.254 --> 14:23.119
Chloe seems to like him.

14:23.290 --> 14:25.622
Careful, Clark, you almost
sound a little jealous.

14:25.792 --> 14:27.953
I'm not jealous, I'm concerned.

14:28.128 --> 14:31.325
Why, because Chloe's falling for a
nice guy? It's got me worried too.

14:31.498 --> 14:32.829
Look.

14:33.567 --> 14:36.400
Justin had this in his
portfolio yesterday.

14:37.771 --> 14:41.673
"Going Down. Doctor Loses
Hands in Freak Accident."

14:41.842 --> 14:44.709
- So?
- That was Justin's doctor.

14:45.212 --> 14:47.339
Don't you think it's weird
he's carrying that?

14:47.848 --> 14:50.373
I liked the tragic irony.

14:51.418 --> 14:53.579
You always talk about people
behind their backs?

14:53.753 --> 14:55.653
- Justin, I didn't mean-
- Yes, you did.

14:55.822 --> 15:00.555
I start spending time with Chloe, suddenly
you realize she exists and want me out?

15:00.727 --> 15:04.629
- Chloe and I are just friends.
- You had your chance with her.

15:05.131 --> 15:07.463
Now you let me have mine.

15:23.850 --> 15:26.318
What the hell are you doing here?

15:30.957 --> 15:34.449
I wanted to see what kind
of young man you'd grown into.

15:34.628 --> 15:36.528
A very busy one.

15:37.664 --> 15:39.256
So if there's nothing else-

15:39.432 --> 15:43.459
We were close once, Alexander,
you were like a son to me.

15:43.637 --> 15:46.367
You were an employee.
You were paid to watch me while...

15:46.539 --> 15:50.976
...my mother's health failed and my father
crisscrossed the globe on business.

15:51.177 --> 15:53.441
I loved you like my own.

15:53.613 --> 15:58.516
After the meteor shower, I was the one
who never looked at you differently.

15:59.853 --> 16:02.287
Just because you knew me
at a vulnerable point...

16:02.455 --> 16:05.322
...doesn't give you the right
to waltz back in a decade later.

16:06.426 --> 16:11.887
Things have changed. I've changed.
What do you want from me?

16:12.065 --> 16:14.693
I want you to know
what really happened.

16:15.902 --> 16:19.497
- You lied to my mother on her deathbed.
- No, I didn't.

16:19.673 --> 16:23.165
I had every intention of staying,
but your father sent me away.

16:23.343 --> 16:26.835
After the funeral, he called me
into his office and told me...

16:27.013 --> 16:31.006
...if I ever had contact with you again
that he would disinherit you.

16:31.184 --> 16:32.674
Why would he do that?

16:32.852 --> 16:36.583
Because he wanted you
to be his son, not hers.

16:36.756 --> 16:38.815
So why show up now?

16:40.060 --> 16:44.121
Does the statute of limitations
on my father's threat expire?

16:45.699 --> 16:48.395
I needed to see if you'd found
a way to be true to yourself...

16:48.568 --> 16:50.934
...in spite of Lionel's efforts.

16:53.440 --> 16:58.776
And to be honest,
I wanted your forgiveness.

17:02.115 --> 17:06.211
I'm afraid you'll have to find
a way to grant it to yourself.

17:10.957 --> 17:13.084
Goodbye, Alexander.

17:25.137 --> 17:28.232
I wish everything sold as well as
your mom's organic apple pies.

17:28.407 --> 17:31.502
- Every little bit helps.
- Hey, Clark.

17:31.678 --> 17:36.706
- Hey, Whitney, how's your dad?
- On the mend. Happy to be home.

17:37.684 --> 17:39.584
Hey. Keep Saturday night free.

17:39.753 --> 17:42.381
<i>Got two tickets to Our Town
at the Metropolis Playhouse.</i>

17:42.889 --> 17:47.258
- Wow. What inspired you to do that?
- Saw you reading it at school.

17:47.427 --> 17:50.191
Thought I might start making up
for some lost time.

17:52.365 --> 17:55.129
- See you.
- Bye.

18:00.840 --> 18:05.038
Whitney has paid more attention to me in
the last two weeks than he has all year.

18:05.211 --> 18:07.202
Have you talked to him about it?

18:07.480 --> 18:09.948
He's seemed so happy ever
since his dad got better.

18:10.116 --> 18:14.052
- He wants to pick up where we left off.
- How do you feel about that?

18:15.321 --> 18:18.017
After Mr. Fordman got sick,
Whitney needed me.

18:18.191 --> 18:22.821
Kind of defined our relationship.
Now we need to redefine it.

18:23.029 --> 18:25.190
There's a lot of that going on.

18:26.066 --> 18:30.025
- How are things with Chloe?
- Unresolved.

18:31.171 --> 18:33.139
What are you gonna do?

18:33.306 --> 18:37.208
I don't know, just don't want
to lose a friend in the process.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.210
Once you've crossed that line,
you can't go back.

18:41.815 --> 18:46.377
Chloe gave that same advice
about someone else.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.211
What happened?

18:50.390 --> 18:54.884
- Decided to stay friends.
- Do you regret that decision?

18:56.229 --> 19:01.633
Yeah. I let that moment slip away
and I don't think I'll ever get it back.

19:03.570 --> 19:05.936
I don't want to make
that same mistake twice.

19:16.216 --> 19:20.380
Hey. I just emailed the partial license
plate details of your hit-and-run...

19:20.553 --> 19:24.011
...to my contact at the DMV. I told him
to start with cars in the county.

19:24.190 --> 19:27.682
He said that he would fax me
whatever information he found.

19:28.328 --> 19:29.920
Wow.

19:31.931 --> 19:34.900
Oh, here, it took me all night.

19:39.472 --> 19:41.303
Oh, wow.

19:42.742 --> 19:46.508
- It's beautiful.
- Well, so are you.

19:49.215 --> 19:53.208
Did you know that after that car hit me
and I was lying in the road...

19:53.386 --> 19:58.016
- ... I kept picturing your face?
- Me? Why me?

19:59.058 --> 20:01.549
Because I always had
the biggest crush on you.

20:01.728 --> 20:06.665
And I was too afraid to do anything.
I thought, here I am about to die...

20:06.833 --> 20:10.166
...and I'm never gonna get the
chance to tell her how I feel.

20:10.770 --> 20:14.501
But when you started emailing me
when I was in the hospital...

20:15.608 --> 20:20.875
...I knew that this was my chance and I
wasn't going to let you get away twice.

20:25.618 --> 20:28.086
I fought my way back for you.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.685
What just happened?

21:03.756 --> 21:06.691
- Can you keep an open mind?
- Sure.

21:07.627 --> 21:09.822
Something happened to me
after the accident...

21:09.996 --> 21:13.454
...and when I was in the hospital
I found that I could move things.

21:14.634 --> 21:17.797
- With my mind.
- Like telekinesis?

21:19.405 --> 21:21.566
Am I freaking you out?

21:22.475 --> 21:25.808
Believe it or not,
I have seen stranger things.

21:25.979 --> 21:29.745
Because I don't want
to end up on your wall.

21:29.916 --> 21:35.786
Don't worry, you won't. Now,
let's make everything float again.

21:40.159 --> 21:42.127
Hey, Chloe, can I-?

21:48.568 --> 21:52.766
- Can I talk to you outside for a second?
- Yeah, sure, Clark.

21:52.939 --> 21:55.271
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

22:14.961 --> 22:17.896
Don't you think this Justin
thing is moving a little too fast?

22:18.064 --> 22:22.433
We've been emailing for six months.
I know him better than I know you.

22:23.236 --> 22:25.670
- Did he say what happened to his doctor?
- No.

22:26.172 --> 22:29.403
But he did tell me that you were
talking about him behind his back.

22:29.575 --> 22:32.976
- I was just looking out for you, Chloe.
- What's with you, Clark?

22:33.146 --> 22:34.807
Do you have some savior complex?

22:34.981 --> 22:39.441
If I'm in trouble you'll rescue me. Other
than that you're emotionally unavailable.

22:39.619 --> 22:43.111
I just don't want you getting involved
with Justin because you're mad at me.

22:43.289 --> 22:46.554
Believe it or not, Clark, my world
does not revolve around you.

22:46.726 --> 22:49.354
Why can't you accept that
I've found someone special...

22:49.529 --> 22:52.828
...and unlike you, I'm willing
to take a chance?

23:20.593 --> 23:25.428
Just tell me one thing,
was it easy to lie to everybody?

23:25.898 --> 23:31.165
- Justin? What are you doing here?
- Reliving old memories.

23:31.704 --> 23:33.865
I think you should go home.

23:37.510 --> 23:42.470
I was only halfway across the crosswalk
when your car came barreling around.

23:43.249 --> 23:45.717
Hit me so hard, it felt
like I'd been broken in half.

23:46.185 --> 23:48.415
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:50.757 --> 23:53.920
I remember lying in the street,
blood dripping into my eyes...

23:54.093 --> 23:58.792
...watching your taillights disappear.
You didn't even bother to stop.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.265
It wasn't me.

24:11.411 --> 24:13.276
It started in the hospital.

24:13.446 --> 24:17.780
Maybe as a way to compensate for
the motor skills I'd lost in my hands.

24:19.051 --> 24:21.485
I was immobilized in a total body cast.

24:21.654 --> 24:24.555
Then I found that I could move
things just by thinking.

24:35.067 --> 24:37.627
But that didn't replace what I'd lost.

24:39.205 --> 24:41.799
Because nothing could ever do that.

24:48.281 --> 24:50.408
Justin, stop it!

24:50.783 --> 24:55.379
Do you know what it feels like
to be hit by a 2000-pound car?

25:26.152 --> 25:28.313
Hey, Lex, what are you
doing here so late?

25:28.488 --> 25:32.015
Came to talk to your parents about the
settlement. What are you reading?

25:38.264 --> 25:40.255
<i>Men are From Mars,
Women are From Venus?</i>

25:40.433 --> 25:43.459
I'm trying to get an insight
into the female psyche.

25:43.636 --> 25:48.437
I seriously doubt you'll find it
in here. What's the problem?

25:49.575 --> 25:53.306
I've got these two amazing friends
who both happen to be girls.

25:54.480 --> 25:58.416
For argument's sake,
let's call them Lana and Chloe.

25:59.085 --> 26:02.714
I've always liked Lana,
but I could never get near her.

26:03.122 --> 26:06.114
I found out that Chloe likes me,
I may have feelings for her too.

26:06.292 --> 26:07.759
Which one do you want to pursue?

26:07.927 --> 26:10.259
I want to protect my
friendship with both.

26:10.429 --> 26:12.897
Then you'll never get either one.

26:13.966 --> 26:17.561
Thanks. Think I'll stick with the book.

26:17.737 --> 26:21.229
Clark, love isn't about playing
it safe, it's about risks.

26:21.407 --> 26:24.308
Unless you put yourself
out there, you'll never know.

26:24.477 --> 26:28.971
- Have you ever been in love before?
- I've only loved two women in my life.

26:29.148 --> 26:33.141
- One died and the other betrayed me.
- I'm sorry.

26:34.053 --> 26:36.487
Some people are meant to be alone.

26:43.563 --> 26:48.591
- Mom, what is it?
- It's Principal Kwan.

26:48.768 --> 26:51.464
He was killed in an accident.

26:58.644 --> 27:02.080
- Hey, guys. How are you holding up?
- I still can't believe this happened.

27:02.248 --> 27:05.649
Putting together a memorial issue but
when you're looking for pictures...

27:05.818 --> 27:09.811
...you never find them. Pete, can you
check the library files? One more time?

27:09.989 --> 27:11.923
- Sure.
- Thank you.

27:12.091 --> 27:17.586
Got Kwan's police report. His car was
still on, it must have slipped into gear.

27:17.763 --> 27:21.494
- Chloe, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

27:22.034 --> 27:24.468
- I can't find anything in this office!
- Let me help.

27:24.637 --> 27:26.571
No, thank you.

27:30.343 --> 27:32.140
Chloe, look at this.

27:33.713 --> 27:37.809
The first three numbers of Kwan's license
plate match Justin's hit-and-run driver.

27:37.984 --> 27:39.576
- What are you getting at?
- Well...

27:39.752 --> 27:42.186
...there's a lot of weird accidents
around this guy.

27:42.355 --> 27:45.324
Clark, you are seriously barking
up the wrong tree here.

27:45.491 --> 27:47.425
Did you get a response from the DMV?

27:47.593 --> 27:49.720
- No, it never came through.
- Yes, you did.

27:49.895 --> 27:52.921
4:43 yesterday. Around
the time you were here with Justin.

27:53.099 --> 27:55.431
- He couldn't have done it.
- Because you like him?

27:55.601 --> 27:59.037
No, because I know him and
I know he wouldn't hurt anyone.

28:04.977 --> 28:06.877
I hope you're right.

28:16.522 --> 28:22.392
"I celebrate myself and what
I assume you shall assume."

28:22.561 --> 28:27.624
"For every atom belonging to me
as good belongs to you."

28:29.602 --> 28:32.070
Sounds like a description
of family, doesn't it?

28:32.238 --> 28:35.730
Not ours. Since when
do you read poetry?

28:36.075 --> 28:39.977
We're selling Cadmus Labs, Lex.

28:40.479 --> 28:44.472
Our deal memo gives me 50 percent
ownership with veto rights.

28:44.650 --> 28:47.210
I don't recall you asking my opinion.

28:47.386 --> 28:49.445
We only bought Cadmus
to bankrupt Sir Harry.

28:49.622 --> 28:52.921
After we pumped and dumped the stock,
the company's worthless.

28:53.092 --> 28:54.923
It served its purpose.

28:55.227 --> 28:58.685
You didn't come all this way
to talk about Cadmus.

28:59.632 --> 29:03.124
I understand Pamela's
back in the States.

29:03.302 --> 29:06.396
- And that she paid you a visit.
- Did you come to disinherit me?

29:06.672 --> 29:09.436
- Is that what she told you?
- Is it true?

29:10.576 --> 29:14.808
Your mother was
an extraordinary woman.

29:15.147 --> 29:21.017
But her taste in help left a lot to be
desired. Pamela was a hanger-on.

29:21.454 --> 29:24.321
She convinced your mother
to leave her all that stock, then...

29:24.490 --> 29:26.856
...she disappeared before
the body was even cold.

29:27.293 --> 29:29.921
You took time out of your busy
schedule to tell me that?

29:30.096 --> 29:35.193
I know how much she meant to you and I
don't want her using emotional tyranny...

29:35.367 --> 29:37.801
- ... to hit you up for money.
- Why would she do that?

29:37.970 --> 29:39.267
She's got plenty of stock.

29:39.605 --> 29:42.699
Probably she doesn't want to sell it
to pay her medical bills.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.433
What medical bills?

29:45.678 --> 29:51.446
- She didn't tell you. How noble.
- Tell me what?

29:52.218 --> 29:56.279
She's dying, Lex. Cancer.

29:58.424 --> 30:02.292
Probably all those years sitting
in the sun in Saint-Tropez.

30:05.865 --> 30:09.357
- What does she want?
- Forgiveness.

30:10.870 --> 30:12.997
And what did you tell her?

30:14.206 --> 30:15.969
To get out.

30:18.177 --> 30:23.479
No. She doesn't know you
very well, does she?

30:46.672 --> 30:48.640
What are you doing in here?

30:48.808 --> 30:54.246
Danny, I'm really sorry about
what happened to your dad.

30:57.950 --> 31:01.716
I don't understand what happened.
He had the car keys with him.

31:01.887 --> 31:07.052
It's like something just smashed
the car right into him.

31:09.228 --> 31:12.129
Danny, did you know a Justin Gaines?

31:13.199 --> 31:15.463
Do you know if he came
by here last night?

31:15.634 --> 31:17.465
No, why?

31:18.470 --> 31:22.998
I think Justin believes your father
was responsible for the accident.

31:23.175 --> 31:25.735
That's crazy. You should leave.

31:25.911 --> 31:30.041
He matched part of your dad's license
plate to the hit-and-run driver's.

31:40.392 --> 31:42.724
Is there a chance Justin's right?

31:44.096 --> 31:46.394
My dad didn't deserve this.

31:49.735 --> 31:53.000
Your dad wasn't the one
driving the car, was he?

31:57.643 --> 31:59.668
You're the one who hit Justin.

32:00.045 --> 32:01.808
My dad...

32:04.950 --> 32:07.350
...he was just trying to protect me.

32:30.409 --> 32:32.206
Chloe?

32:36.282 --> 32:39.809
- My mom said you were here.
- Oh, I wanted to surprise you.

32:39.985 --> 32:43.853
I didn't see you at school today.
Did you hear about Principal Kwan?

32:44.423 --> 32:47.517
- I did. That's really weird, right?
- Yeah.

32:47.693 --> 32:50.457
I guess you never know
when your time's up.

32:50.629 --> 32:55.726
Which is why I think we should make
the most of the time that we have.

32:57.736 --> 33:01.570
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I forgot, I just remembered...

33:02.608 --> 33:05.509
...I told Clark I'd meet him at his house.

33:06.979 --> 33:11.848
For someone that is out of the picture,
you sure spend a lot of time with him.

33:12.017 --> 33:16.545
Don't worry. Today I plan on telling him
exactly what's going on between us.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.911
You did the right thing, Clark.
Convincing Danny to turn himself in.

33:45.084 --> 33:49.350
- His father's dead. He's going to jail.
- Some secrets destroy families.

33:49.521 --> 33:52.581
Clark, Chloe's on the phone,
she sounds really freaked out.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.523
- Chloe, what's up?
- I've been calling all over the place.

33:57.696 --> 34:00.460
I really screwed up, Justin
is involved, you were right.

34:00.632 --> 34:03.465
<i>- Well, calm down. Where are you?
- In your barn.</i>

34:03.635 --> 34:06.160
I haven't been completely
honest with you, Clark.

34:06.338 --> 34:09.239
I know how Justin caused
those accidents.

34:11.543 --> 34:12.873
Chloe? Chloe!

34:20.284 --> 34:21.946
Justin?

34:41.639 --> 34:45.371
How could you betray me? How could
you betray what we had together?

35:09.668 --> 35:10.999
Oh, no!

35:14.807 --> 35:18.766
That's what I love about you,
Chloe. You're a fighter.

35:43.335 --> 35:48.034
I'm sorry. I didn't want it
to end like this.

36:00.719 --> 36:03.483
- How did you do that?
- You killed the wrong man.

36:03.655 --> 36:05.987
- You're lying.
- His son just turned himself in.

36:06.425 --> 36:08.916
- He was the one who hit you.
- That is not true!

36:09.094 --> 36:12.928
You said you cared about Chloe. How
many people are you willing to kill?

36:13.098 --> 36:14.827
Just one more.

36:18.203 --> 36:21.138
You've really got to stick
those landings, Clark.

36:22.107 --> 36:24.200
You can't win, Justin.

36:35.220 --> 36:38.189
Chloe, are you okay?

37:14.526 --> 37:18.826
- You're the last person I expected.
- Why didn't you tell me?

37:18.997 --> 37:22.728
- It's not your concern.
- It's not my concern that you're dying?

37:24.736 --> 37:29.639
- I could help, I can get you treatment.
- I didn't come to you for help or pity...

37:29.808 --> 37:33.437
...I came because I have
nothing left to lose.

37:38.584 --> 37:43.886
The truth is, I'm ashamed that it took
metastasizing to give me the courage.

37:44.056 --> 37:48.618
I let that bastard frighten me
into submission for so long.

37:48.961 --> 37:55.389
I was too scared to even tell you
just once how much you mean to me.

37:57.769 --> 38:01.034
How much I wanted
to help you grow up.

38:01.273 --> 38:06.233
I wish you had. I might be a better man.

38:07.145 --> 38:12.378
The fact that you're here speaks
volumes about the man that you are.

38:16.455 --> 38:18.980
Your mother would be proud.

38:23.895 --> 38:28.355
- I really miss her.
- So do I.

38:54.459 --> 38:57.121
- I just spoke to Justin's parents.
- How's he doing?

38:57.296 --> 39:00.663
He's in the psychiatric ward. The police
don't know what to charge him with...

39:00.832 --> 39:02.925
...but at least he won't hurt anybody.

39:04.436 --> 39:10.671
So should we do the "I told you so" part
or is my perennial bad judgment implicit?

39:10.876 --> 39:12.935
Chloe, I wish I were wrong.

39:13.412 --> 39:17.678
What is it with me? I can spot Wall of
Weird material from a mile away...

39:17.849 --> 39:20.010
...but put it in front of me
and I'm oblivious.

39:20.285 --> 39:23.049
You're not oblivious, you're trusting.

39:23.555 --> 39:26.388
You're strong enough to take risks
with your emotions.

39:26.558 --> 39:28.958
I wish I were as brave as you.

39:30.829 --> 39:33.491
I still have those tickets
to the journalism convention.

39:35.334 --> 39:38.462
It'd be a good chance for us
to spend some time together.

39:39.971 --> 39:42.030
Okay, it's a date.

40:07.532 --> 40:10.330
Whitney, we need to talk.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.196
What is it? What happened?

40:16.308 --> 40:18.173
It's my dad.
