00:05.005 --> 00:07.371
# Good morning, U.S.A. #

00:07.474 --> 00:11.069
# I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day #

00:11.177 --> 00:14.078
#The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face #

00:14.180 --> 00:17.877
#And he's shining a salute
to the American race ##

00:20.887 --> 00:22.912
[Gasps]
Roger, have you seen-

00:23.023 --> 00:26.481
Hang on. This look like
a puppy nose or part of a teacup?

00:26.593 --> 00:29.687
Oh, part of the eye.
What a roller coaster!

00:29.796 --> 00:33.129
- Look at this!
- Oh, my God!

00:33.233 --> 00:35.895
Check out those calves.
You know what that is?

00:36.002 --> 00:37.970
That's taking the stairs
instead of the elevator.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.232
- How did this happen?
- I have no idea.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.968
I leave the house in disguise.
But six Rob Roys later...

00:43.076 --> 00:44.976
things happen that
I can't be responsible for.

00:45.078 --> 00:48.275
Like buying this puzzle.
Why the hell did I buy this puzzle?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.281
[Grunts]
I hate puppies!

00:50.383 --> 00:52.908
Get out of that teacup!
That cup is for tea!

00:53.019 --> 00:54.919
Roger, you have to be more careful.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.579
Do you know what the C.I.A.
Would do to me...

00:56.689 --> 00:58.452
if they found out
I was harboring an alien?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.822
Oh, my God.
Give him a daytime Emmy.

01:00.927 --> 01:04.090
So dramatic.
Look, I'm sure it was just a fluke.

01:04.197 --> 01:07.963
SomeJohnny Shutterbug got lucky.
Relax. It'll never happen again.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.628
I have more pictures
of the alien to sell!

01:12.005 --> 01:13.973
These are incredible!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.974
The newspaper could really use these.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.068
- What do I owe you?
- You got any of those Sacagawea dollars?

01:19.179 --> 01:22.842
When I walk past the homeless,
I want my pants to jingle like a big shot.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.749
Damn it!

01:26.853 --> 01:29.344
We've been hunting aliens
for years with no results.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.515
And now there's one
right under our noses.

01:31.624 --> 01:33.854
Sir, it's- it's obviously a hoax.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.327
It's not a hoax. It's bloody
embarrassing is what it is.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.365
Not quite <i>" soiling yourself
at P.F. Chang's" embarrassing...</i>

01:40.467 --> 01:42.367
but still.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.369
I told you that in confidence.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.063
Relax. No one knows it's you.

01:46.172 --> 01:49.835
Anyway, our Alien Task Force
clearly needs some rejiggering.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.843
Ray, you're no longer in charge.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.345
- Of what?
- The Alien Task Force.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.848
- What the hell's that?
- The task force you've been in charge of.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.943
Oh. How did I do?

02:03.056 --> 02:06.719
- Now, I need a new team leader.
- Sir, I'm your man.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.726
I will not rest until the alien...

02:08.828 --> 02:11.160
and all his accomplices are brought to jus-

02:11.264 --> 02:13.164
- He told me he hates you!
- What?

02:13.266 --> 02:15.530
- Jackson, is this true?
- Yes.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.399
Get out of my sight!
Smith, how do you feel about me?

02:18.505 --> 02:22.032
- You're okay, I guess.
- Good. Then you're the man for this job.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.666
Ah!

02:26.279 --> 02:28.679
Don't worry, Lady Peckinpah.

02:28.781 --> 02:33.013
I'd sell a thousand naked pictures
to the paper to keep you in luxury.

02:33.119 --> 02:36.054
- Who's pretty? Who's a pretty princess?
- [Squawks]

02:36.156 --> 02:38.784
That's right, I am.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.759
Damn it, Roger! Look at this!
Someone must be following you.

02:41.861 --> 02:43.829
Some people are leaders,
some are followers.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.194
I guess I'm a leader.
Did you read <i>The Tipping Point?</i>

02:46.299 --> 02:48.199
I didn't.
Perhaps it applies.

02:48.301 --> 02:51.361
Roger, if you get caught,
they'll trace it back to me and kill me!

02:51.471 --> 02:53.871
That's what they do to people
who hide aliens in their attic.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.339
Shh! You want the whole neighborhood
to hear you?

02:56.442 --> 03:00.435
- Hmm. Your lips are really, really puffy.
- Now, you listen to me!

03:00.547 --> 03:04.210
Hey, hey, check that 'tude at the door.
You are not the boss of me.

03:04.317 --> 03:06.547
Well, I am the boss of this house.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.486
Until this thing blows over,
you are not to leave this attic.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.489
No one can take
any more pictures of you.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.788
Okay, you got it. No one's gonna
get any more candid pics, I promise.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.392
I said no more <i>candid</i> pics.
I love semantics.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.098
Wordplay.
Who am I talking to?

03:29.909 --> 03:32.309
Then we affix the wire to the nail.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.778
And- It works!

03:34.881 --> 03:37.907
We finally harnessed
the awesome power of the potato!

03:38.017 --> 03:40.383
Actually, the potato has no power.

03:40.486 --> 03:43.284
It's just a buffer between
the copper and the zinc ions.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.289
But it's cute that you thought that.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.588
I think you're cute
with your face and body.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.459
Hayley, I did my part to save water.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.464
I showered with the salad plates.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.659
Mom, this is my lab partner Katie.

03:58.871 --> 04:02.329
Um, Steve,
could I speak to you for a second?

04:04.377 --> 04:07.278
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
that girl is gonna have to leave.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.508
I'm just not comfortable
having their kind in my house.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.108
- Mom!
- Did you just say what I thought you said?

04:13.219 --> 04:16.814
I'm sorry,
but you're going to have to leave.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.723
Oh. Okay.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.954
Well, see you at school, Steve.

04:26.466 --> 04:30.300
- Oh, my God!
- That was terrible.

04:32.805 --> 04:35.706
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, terrible.

04:37.410 --> 04:40.937
Got some more pics
for your crappy gossip rag.

04:41.047 --> 04:43.481
- C.I. A! Alien Task Force!
- We got him!

04:46.986 --> 04:50.046
Smith, we've made a break
in the alien case.

04:50.156 --> 04:52.989
What? But I'm in charge of that!
Why don't I know about this?

04:53.092 --> 04:56.027
Well, we got a tip.
We couldn't find you, so we went with it.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.029
Did you look for me?
Did you even look?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.100
I was probably in the rest-Wait.
I know what happened. It was bad times...

05:01.200 --> 05:03.031
so I went to the can
on the third floor.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.400
The point is, we got him.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.836
Oh, my God!

05:06.939 --> 05:08.839
This is the photographer...

05:08.941 --> 05:10.875
who has been taking
all the alien pictures.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.002
Mr. Parker Peters.

05:13.112 --> 05:17.412
I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so you'll
pardon me if I don't kiss you on the lips.

05:17.517 --> 05:21.248
- <i>You?</i> You took all those pictures?
- He sure did.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.755
And since he somehow managed
to get closer to the alien than anyone...

05:24.857 --> 05:26.757
we've put him in charge of the case.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.191
He's going to catch this alien
and bring him in.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.695
- But, sir-
- You'll be answering to Peters now.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.825
- Give him anything he needs.
- Yes, <i>I'm</i> the boss of <i>you.</i>

05:35.935 --> 05:39.063
- What's your name?
- Stan.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.072
Hmm. I already know a Stan.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.940
I'm gonna call you Mortimer.
Now, run and fix me a coffee.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.205
Today, MortimerJames!

05:47.313 --> 05:49.781
I add the middle name
when I'm disappointed in him.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.955
<i>Hey, Stan, wanna carpool to work?</i>
<i>Name's Agent Parker Peters.</i>

05:59.058 --> 06:02.425
My sister Samantha
was abducted by aliens when I was 12.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.428
Now I chase little green men.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.589
Isn't that Mulder's backstory
from <i>The X Files?</i>

06:06.699 --> 06:09.190
Is it?
Mmm, no. No.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.270
I'm pretty sure
I came up with it first.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.135
When was <i>The X Files?</i>
Was it before a few seconds ago?

06:15.708 --> 06:18.074
Roger, you're not going
to work at the C.I. A!

06:18.177 --> 06:20.645
We've been over this, Staniel.
They hired me.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.738
I have to show up,
or it'll look suspicious.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.285
I'll go to work for a week, say I
came up empty, and quit. No big whoop.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.651
If you'd listened to me in the first place,
none of this would be happening.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.849
And I wouldn't have Lady Peckinpah.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.222
[Whistling]

06:37.063 --> 06:40.464
I'll be in your car
wishing you had a better car.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.500
[Sighs]

06:46.406 --> 06:48.306
Isn't it great I got my own office?

06:48.408 --> 06:51.900
You don't even have your own office, and you've
worked at the C.I.A. How many years now?

06:52.011 --> 06:53.911
Sixty?

06:55.515 --> 06:58.245
- Give me that! Are you crazy?
- Ow! You're gripping!

06:58.351 --> 07:01.081
You have to take this seriously.
Both of our asses are...

07:01.187 --> 07:03.519
- <i>[Clearing Throat]</i>
- Equally nice.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.387
- We both have nice butts.
- Make that three of us.

07:06.492 --> 07:09.859
I just stopped by to see how
our new alien hunter's settling in.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.328
Unsettling is the word I'd use, sir.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.094
Unsettling knowing that
the alien is out there...

07:15.201 --> 07:18.193
somewhere out in that
wide, wide world.

07:18.304 --> 07:21.535
What's your game, spaceman?

07:21.641 --> 07:23.541
Well, I'll let you get to it.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.543
Oh, we're sending Dick
on a doughnut run.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.545
Are you a jelly or a fritter man?

07:27.647 --> 07:30.138
- Oh, I don't have any cash on me.
- [Chuckling]

07:30.249 --> 07:34.948
Cash? You have a vast,
almost unending expense account.

07:35.054 --> 07:38.615
The C.I.A. Will pay for anything
you need to track the alien.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.859
Anything, you say?

07:41.961 --> 07:45.556
You know, I think
I do have leads in...

07:45.665 --> 07:47.565
Aruba, Jamaica-

07:47.667 --> 07:49.567
## [Humming]

07:49.669 --> 07:53.070
Key Largo, Montego-
## [Humming]

07:53.172 --> 07:55.072
Oh, oh.
And a place called Kokomo.

07:55.174 --> 07:57.074
Great! Book a flight.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.644
Get there fast,
and then take it slow.

07:59.745 --> 08:03.806
Just let Smith know,
and he'll write up the expense report.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.248
Set this jar of
jellybeans on my desk.

08:06.352 --> 08:08.411
I hear it'll make me
a more approachable boss.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.012
If you ever eat one,
so help me, I'll destroy you.

08:11.123 --> 08:13.557
<i>Mom, I'm home.</i>

08:13.659 --> 08:15.684
And I brought over
some friends from school.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.457
- Black ones, to be specific.
- That's right, Mom!

08:18.564 --> 08:20.862
Some of my best friends are black.

08:20.967 --> 08:24.528
- Who is this girl again?
- I don't know. She said we could use her pool.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.606
Oh, perfect timing.
I just made cookies.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.675
They're in the kitchen.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.679
Wait. I thought you hated black people.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.442
What? No! How awful!

08:37.549 --> 08:40.519
But what about my lab partner?
You kicked her out!

08:40.620 --> 08:43.589
Of course I did!
She's left-handed.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.680
Lefties are the devil's minions...

08:45.791 --> 08:49.454
and you are never to bring
another one into this house!

08:50.730 --> 08:52.630
Can we use this alligator?

08:52.732 --> 08:54.632
- Uh, sure.
- She said okay!

08:54.734 --> 08:57.362
- <i>[Boys Cheering]</i>
- <i>[Boy] Alligator!</i>

08:59.972 --> 09:01.872
This is my first time in Jamaica...

09:01.974 --> 09:05.410
and I gotta say, ladies,
this country is awful.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.536
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- It's work.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.615
I gotta take this.
I am a businessman.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.513
Whoever comes back with the yummiest drink
gets to watch me drink it.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.677
Second prize, a shot to the chops.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.449
That's called incentive. Double <i>" P" here.
What do you got?</i>

09:17.557 --> 09:21.254
What I've got is a receipt
for a $2,000 yacht party!

09:21.360 --> 09:24.852
Oh, that's nothing. I actually
crashed the yacht into an offshore rig.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.898
Whole thing went up in flames.
Super dramatic.

09:26.999 --> 09:30.435
You'll be getting the bill for that too.
Do not tip. I took care of the tip.

09:30.536 --> 09:34.404
Roger, it's time for you to get your
ass home and quit like we talked about.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.998
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I got a new plan now-

09:37.109 --> 09:40.044
to milk this expense account thing
for as long as I can.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.740
- Hold on.
- [Beeping]

09:45.918 --> 09:49.251
Just spotted the alien in a cabana.
Or is it <i>" cabanya"?</i>

09:49.355 --> 09:51.414
The kid who brought me
my towel said <i>" cabanya"...</i>

09:51.524 --> 09:53.822
but I don't even think he's from here.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.826
Well, if he is, he's not from money.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.864
- [Beeps]
- Whoo!

09:59.966 --> 10:02.799
I can party forever!

10:02.902 --> 10:06.269
[Groans]
I'm gettin' old.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.806
Can't bounce back like I used to.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.138
- Those Montego bitches are crazy.
- <i>[Fizzing]</i>

10:11.243 --> 10:13.438
Bullock has something to tell you!
He's gonna tell you that-

10:13.546 --> 10:15.946
- No, no, no. No, no. You-You tell him.
- Tell me what?

10:16.048 --> 10:19.040
What I already know?
That the alien is still out there...

10:19.151 --> 10:21.051
mocking me, taunting me?

10:21.153 --> 10:23.713
Show yourself, unholy creature!

10:25.458 --> 10:27.517
Why'd you let this happen, Morty?
You saw it spinning.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.824
You saw me reach for it, and you just
stood there. Why'd you just stand there?

10:30.930 --> 10:35.299
Peters, Agent Smith has brought
some troubling receipts to my attention.

10:35.401 --> 10:38.234
$600 on ouzo at the Pink Palace.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.828
$1,200 dogsledding across Reykjavik.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.840
All necessary.
Besides...

10:42.942 --> 10:45.502
each time I track him,
I get a little closer.

10:45.611 --> 10:49.012
Apparently, he thought hanging
with penguins would be a blast.

10:49.115 --> 10:53.211
Did you know the dudes sit on the eggs?
No, thank you.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.220
We're paying you to catch him,
not just document him.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.553
How is it that you keep getting
so close without seizing him?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.718
The thing is...

11:01.827 --> 11:04.694
the alien, he-

11:04.797 --> 11:06.697
he can-

11:06.799 --> 11:10.633
Coffee stirrer.
Hot cup. Cup, cup, cup.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.670
Glass- Glass!
George Glass!

11:12.772 --> 11:14.740
That's Jan Brady's fake boyfriend.

11:16.642 --> 11:18.940
Oh. Why-
Why haven't I caught the alien? Um-

11:19.045 --> 11:20.945
Oh, I know.

11:21.047 --> 11:24.505
The alien has the ability
to go into any human body.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.778
One minute, he's in front of you.
The next, poof!

11:26.886 --> 11:29.047
He pops into the nearest human,
and he's lost.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.487
- That is ridiculous!
- Peters, I'm afraid...

11:31.590 --> 11:33.683
if you don't bring in
some actual physical evidence...

11:33.793 --> 11:35.693
I'm going to have
to shut you down...

11:35.795 --> 11:39.788
like Kobe shut down
the Timberwolves last night.

11:39.899 --> 11:42.697
- Nobody watches sports?
- Oh, I love sports.

11:42.802 --> 11:47.136
I'm always kicking
or jumping or flapping.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.768
[Roger]
Physical evidence.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.073
I'll give them physical evidence.
[Straining]

11:55.281 --> 11:57.977
Come on!
[Straining]

11:58.084 --> 12:00.575
[Farts Loudly]

12:00.686 --> 12:03.211
Oh. Protoplasm.
That could work too.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.923
Yellow and blue make green.
That's how I know it's closed.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.264
- [Line Ringing]
- It's ringing.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.459
- Hello?
- Mah-Mah, it's Steve and Hayley.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.505
Oh! It's so nice
of my grandchildren to call.

12:20.606 --> 12:23.803
We just wanna ask you,
why does Mom hate left-handed people?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.877
Oh, that.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.879
- That's because of the orphanage.
- Orphanage?

12:28.981 --> 12:31.643
We didn't adopt Francine
until she was seven.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.914
<i>We found her when she was five,</i>
<i>but she was too expensive.</i>

12:35.020 --> 12:37.648
<i>But we visit her while</i>
<i>we wait for market to fall.</i>

12:37.757 --> 12:40.317
[Irish Accent] Okay, sweetie.
Time to work on your penmanship.

12:42.094 --> 12:46.190
No! Evil-
writing with your left hand!

12:46.298 --> 12:48.823
Lefties are the devil's minions!

12:51.070 --> 12:54.301
She usually beat her with a side of beef,
but this was a Friday.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.306
That's terrible!

12:56.408 --> 13:00.606
By the time we adopt her, she was
convinced that left-handedness was evil.

13:00.713 --> 13:03.705
Of course!
Mom's left-handed hatred was learned...

13:03.816 --> 13:05.841
which means we can
help her unlearn it.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.851
<i>Hey! What wrong with you?</i>

13:07.953 --> 13:10.820
I still here!
Now tell me about your day.

13:10.923 --> 13:14.290
Oh, I'm sorry, Mah-Mah.
Well, this morning I went-

13:14.393 --> 13:17.658
Mah-Mah always hang up first.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.792
As soon as Agent Peters
shows up, we can start.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.166
- I wouldn't wait, sir. He was-
- <i>[Roger] Gentlemen...</i>

13:25.271 --> 13:27.068
I have something to show you.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.700
Well, I should hope so.
Everybody does. It's show-and-tell day!

13:30.810 --> 13:34.302
But you'll have to wait your turn.
Sanders is first.

13:34.413 --> 13:38.144
This was my grandfather's.
He was in the war. He was very brave.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.310
- Mmm.
- Great. Thanks. My turn.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.651
In my hand,
I hold proof of alien life.

13:44.757 --> 13:48.488
- [All Gasp]
- Agent Peters, I'm sure you're mistaken.

13:48.594 --> 13:53.861
No alien would be stupid enough to leave
behind hard evidence of its existence, right?

13:53.966 --> 13:58.300
No, no. This alien is. I was at Taco King
when I saw him by the salsa bar.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.339
I acquired this sample
before the bastard got away.

14:01.440 --> 14:05.843
I strongly suspect he may now be
on any island butJamaica.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.539
- That place is awful.
- There's gunk that looks just like that...

14:08.647 --> 14:12.743
- all over the bathroom stall.
- We need to get a sample
from that bathroom stat.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.946
If it matches the alien substance
that Peters turned in...

14:16.055 --> 14:18.489
that means the alien
is in the building.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.253
We'll lock this place down
and test everyone.

14:23.062 --> 14:25.155
As soon as show-and-tell is done.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.232
Dick, I believe you're up.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.325
I don't have anything
for show-and-tell.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.563
I just found out
I have liver cancer.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.265
I'm giving you a zero for the day.

14:36.842 --> 14:39.276
<i>[Stan]</i>
<i>Oh! It's everywhere!</i>

14:39.378 --> 14:41.642
How could you just
leave this stuff here?

14:41.747 --> 14:45.410
<i>[Roger]</i>
<i>Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary.</i>

14:45.517 --> 14:47.781
- Bloody Mary.
- Roger!

14:47.887 --> 14:51.084
- [Screams] She's right behind me!
- What is going on here?

14:52.591 --> 14:55.424
Caught him, sir!
The alien jumped into Stan Smith.

14:55.527 --> 14:58.394
I followed him and caught him red-handed
trying to destroy this evidence.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.488
- Seize him!
- What? That's absurd!

15:00.599 --> 15:02.430
He's lying!
You've got to believe me.

15:02.534 --> 15:07.562
I'm gonna hit the urinal.
Maybe you can use the one next to me.

15:13.312 --> 15:15.610
So, the alien's inside of Smith.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.705
- I suggest we all go in that room and-
- No!

15:17.816 --> 15:20.683
He's dangerous.
He could jump into any one of you.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.516
I have to go in... alone.

15:23.622 --> 15:27.353
If I don't make it out of there,
tell my wife I love her.

15:27.459 --> 15:30.121
And Keira Knightley.
Tell Keira Knightley I love her.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.129
And Orlando Bloom.
You know what?

15:32.231 --> 15:35.257
The whole cast.
The whole damn dirty pirate cast.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.768
But not Geoffrey Rush.
But do it in front of Geoffrey Rush.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.005
I know you're in there, spaceman!

15:42.107 --> 15:44.507
- What's your mission? Talk to me!
- I'll kill you!

15:44.610 --> 15:48.774
- [Straining]
- Clearly, we're gonna have to do this the hard way.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.441
That Agent Peters
is one tough S.O. B...

15:51.550 --> 15:54.883
especially for a photographer
we just plucked off the street.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.547
Much better than that
stuck-up Anne Geddes.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.716
Although, Anne did take
that great staff photo.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.624
<i>[Bullock]</i>
<i>That she did. That she did.</i>

16:03.729 --> 16:06.459
I told you to listen to me!
And now we're screwed!

16:06.565 --> 16:08.430
Relax. I'll just go fetch a lizard...

16:08.534 --> 16:11.094
tell Bullock that the alien
jumped out of you and into it...

16:11.203 --> 16:13.330
and you'll walk out
that door scot-free.

16:13.439 --> 16:16.897
That, uh, actually makes sense.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.807
Now, I'm gonna have to rough you up
a little, make it seem like...

16:19.912 --> 16:22.107
I tried to get some info from you.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.520
## [Humming]

16:32.191 --> 16:36.150
Hmm. Not bad.
Perfect.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.863
He's close.
I gotta take a walk to the pet store...

16:39.965 --> 16:42.559
clear my head, and then
I'll go back in and crack that mother.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.728
Uh, no need, Peters.
We're performing the autopsy now.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.898
Agent Smith will die
a horrible, painful death.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.533
But it's worth it
to finally nail this bastard.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.510
You've served your country well.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.740
Uh- Okay.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.749
It's been fun.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.445
Guess I'll just... go then.

17:01.553 --> 17:06.252
Now, we'll crack the rib cage and remove
each and every organ until we find the alien.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.088
- You're gonna die.
- What?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.094
[Sobbing]
You're right!

17:11.195 --> 17:14.063
I screwed up.
They're gonna cut you open.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.760
Roger, calm down.
It's not too late to fix things.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.064
But you need to listen to me.
Can you do that?

17:19.171 --> 17:21.366
Whatever you say, Stan.
I'll do whatever you say.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.566
Take off your clothes.
Do it!

17:23.675 --> 17:26.040
[Whimpering]

17:26.145 --> 17:28.238
<i>Très jolie, Coco.</i>

17:28.347 --> 17:30.247
<i>Très jolie.</i>

17:30.349 --> 17:34.149
Now take your thumb and put it
in your mouth like a little schoolgirl.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.744
Damn it! We don't have time for that!
Take 'em off already!

17:36.855 --> 17:39.722
- Fine! God! Why do you hate movies?
- Good.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.020
- Now walk out that door.
- What?

17:42.127 --> 17:45.290
I'm an alien, Stan, for reals!
They'll kill me!

17:45.397 --> 17:47.422
Roger, I promise you'll get away.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.558
Listen to me for once and do it.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.730
I'll do it, Stan.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.300
There's your alien, men!
I pooped him out!

17:59.411 --> 18:01.311
What?
You said I'd get away!

18:01.413 --> 18:03.643
You sold me out!
I trusted you!

18:03.749 --> 18:05.512
I don't know what he's talking about.

18:05.617 --> 18:08.245
He'll say anything to save his life.
We'd better cut him up immediately.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.344
No! Kill him instead!

18:10.456 --> 18:12.856
He's been harboring me!
I've been living in his-

18:12.958 --> 18:14.858
Large intestine.
It was terrible.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.394
- I thought kidney stones were bad.
- Nice work, Smith.

18:17.496 --> 18:21.455
I assume you'll want some days off
to nurse your devastated bunghole.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.102
<i>Mom, we know why</i>
<i>you hate left-handed people.</i>

18:27.206 --> 18:29.231
- We've been to the orphanage.
- Orphanage? What's that?

18:29.341 --> 18:32.208
There was no orphanage.
Who wants me to make them some laundry?

18:32.311 --> 18:34.211
Mom, you were born left-handed.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.474
Don't speak to me that way!
I'm your mother!

18:36.582 --> 18:40.109
- We have proof. Recognize this?
- [Gasps]

18:40.219 --> 18:43.814
It's the type of mackerel
the nuns used to beat the lies into you.

18:43.922 --> 18:46.322
- You're a lefty!
- No!

18:46.425 --> 18:50.384
[Sobbing]

18:50.496 --> 18:52.361
Yes. Yes, it's true!

18:52.464 --> 18:56.059
Oh! What you children
must think of me.

18:56.168 --> 19:00.104
I'll tell you what we think of you.
You're a strong, vibrant lady...

19:00.205 --> 19:02.730
with two big,
equally beautiful hands.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.968
We love you no matter what.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.843
Oh, Hayley.
I'm so sorry I slapped you.

19:08.947 --> 19:12.508
I'm not. Know why?
'Cause you did it with your left hand.

19:12.618 --> 19:16.486
[Gasps]
And it felt so... right.

19:16.588 --> 19:20.115
It's time I accept the truth
and stop hiding.

19:20.225 --> 19:23.558
- [Sniffles]
- No. Use the left.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.535
I'm a lefty!

19:36.275 --> 19:40.006
I just feel so violated by the fact
that thing was inside me.

19:40.112 --> 19:44.048
- It would mean a lot to me
if I could have the first cut.
- All yours, Smith.

19:44.149 --> 19:46.413
No!

19:46.518 --> 19:51.922
Don't put that mask on me!
I'm not ready to die! Not before Shatner!

19:52.024 --> 19:53.924
I'm doing what has to be done.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.790
- [Muffled Screaming]
- [Gas Hissing]

20:02.801 --> 20:04.860
Huh.

20:07.906 --> 20:10.272
He reversed the gas.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.809
Son of a bitch <i>Superman Two'd</i> me.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.607
<i>" I told you to listen to me."</i>

20:20.719 --> 20:23.313
He did. He totally did.

20:23.422 --> 20:27.825
<i>" P. S: Francine called.
Lady Peckinpah is dead." Ah.</i>

20:30.495 --> 20:32.690
So when we came to,
Bullock reasoned that...

20:32.798 --> 20:35.926
the alien must've emitted
a noxious gas and escaped.

20:37.502 --> 20:40.767
We're out of orange juice.
I'll put it on the list.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.510
<i>[Roger]</i>
<i>Okay, wish me luck.</i>

20:46.612 --> 20:48.910
<i>Playgirl's</i> looking for studs.

20:49.014 --> 20:53.041
Yeah. I'm gonna go down there
and splay it loud and proud.

20:53.151 --> 20:56.450
Roger, I don't think
more naked pictures is such a good idea.

20:56.555 --> 20:59.023
But-But I already
ordered the prosthetic.

20:59.124 --> 21:02.252
And once you strap it on,
they won't take it back!

21:02.361 --> 21:04.727
You know what?
You're right.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.924
I guess I should listen to you
every now and then.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.968
Here, Steve.
Let Mommy butter that toast for you.

21:11.069 --> 21:13.629
Thanks, Mom-
[Screams]

21:18.577 --> 21:21.740
<i># The kid is hot tonight #</i>

21:21.847 --> 21:25.783
<i># Whoa</i>
<i>So hot tonight #</i>

21:26.885 --> 21:31.822
<i># But where will he be tomorrow #</i>

21:31.923 --> 21:35.120
<i># The kid is hot tonight #</i>

21:35.227 --> 21:38.355
<i># Whoa</i>
<i>So hot tonight #</i>

21:40.165 --> 21:42.065
<i># But where will he be #</i>

21:42.167 --> 21:45.193
<i># Where will he be ##</i>

21:45.304 --> 21:47.204
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
