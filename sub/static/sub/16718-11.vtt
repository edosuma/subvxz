SILVERMAN CLINIC FOR
COSMETIC SURGERY

00:30.760 --> 00:33.880
-What are you wearing there?
-That's called lemon green.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.400
-Mom is taken care of.  Espresso?
-Really now?

00:39.440 --> 00:43.040
They don't just do nose operations.
He does a lot of good work.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.640
And they have espresso too.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.280
-I want you to come back.
-Campbell fired me.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.000
-Let me talk to him.
-No, not.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.040
I love the Angels.
I gave him my life.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.000
Why are you so stubborn?

01:05.440 --> 01:08.080
I wanted to call
Guthrie to apologize.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.680
I know you said that,
but it will take time.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.040
A Parkinson diagnosis
is not easy to digest.

01:15.280 --> 01:18.360
He doesn't have to stop working
as a medic, does he know that?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.320
Does Campbell know that?

01:25.520 --> 01:28.680
Convince Guthrie to
come back and I'll come too.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.640
Sixteen.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.120
Patient.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.840
I treated that many
patients in two hours.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.240
-That is a new record.
-Is not it.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.560
I'm just saying that
it is extremely full.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.160
How long is Malaya suspended?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.240
Above my league.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.600
Don't worry, you just have
the typical beginner panic.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.080
-What's this?
-My hipster kidney stone.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.480
Dilaudid was supposed
to ease the pain.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.160
I would rather die
than shed the stone.

02:04.520 --> 02:07.360
-Can you remove the kidney?
-That will not do.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.039
But I can give you an
organ donation brochure.

02:13.240 --> 02:16.400
That is.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.520
Very nice.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.560
I feel like... pancakes.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.320
My gynecologist says
it's an ovarian cyst.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.000
I'm supposed to have an
operation in a few weeks.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.720
But the pain has gotten worse.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.680
I have an ultrasound
of the pelvis.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.480
The cyst may have burst
or an ovary is twisted.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.720
But don't worry,
we'll take care of you.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.560
Your blood pressure
is pretty high, Renee.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.240
This machine gives me away.
I guess I'm nervous.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.640
Don't worry, Dr.  Silverman is
the best breast reconstructor.

02:58.960 --> 03:03.000
Yes, I had to look at more
breasts than you can imagine.

03:03.720 --> 03:07.720
I chose Umas at the time
of Dangerous Liaisons.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.560
Cancer took pretty
much everything from me.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.320
-I want to get something back.
-Hello, you pretty.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.720
-Hi, Dr.  Silverman.
-Then let's get started.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.560
Okay, let's go.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.560
Dr.  Willis!  Dr.  Willis!

03:28.200 --> 03:30.600
This is Blanche, 92 years young,
she fell down a flight of stairs.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.800
Severe pain in left hip,
blood pressure drops.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.280
Blanche, I'm Dr.  Ethan Willis.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.680
You are attractive.
Like my George.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.880
-You passed out?
-I do not think so.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.680
Fine, get the mobile X-ray
machine and the ZVK kit.

03:46.120 --> 03:50.080
-A nice Code Black too!
-When I left everything was okay.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.320
-What did Jesse say?
-No.  He's way too proud.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.560
Vacuum please.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.560
The pulse is at 59, falling.
She is bradycardiac.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.640
-A heart rate of 50 is good.
-Where is the emergency vehicle?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.760
Hey boss  Do you have
PTSD from your old job?

04:16.120 --> 04:18.399
There's no gunshot wound here.
She is fine.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.560
No, she is not.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.240
Your capillaries fill up slowly,
your blood pressure drops.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.760
Your blood pressure is
normal, it's just low because of...

04:29.000 --> 04:30.240
Get the ambulance immediately!

04:30.360 --> 04:32.400
It's in the other room.
Get Epi and Atropine.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.080
Count me in.
An epi is entered.  So.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.800
You!  Call 911!

04:43.080 --> 04:45.680
At three, we'll move them.
One two Three.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.560
-It's too early, isn't it?
-Richard, relax.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.320
-How far are you?
-In the 36th week.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.160
Labor started in the afternoon.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.480
It's a little early, but no
reason to race like this.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.840
Sorry, Serena.  Car
delivery is not planned.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.840
Stroking a bus was
also not intended.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.200
It was just the bumper.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
Contractions?

05:12.520 --> 05:14.480
-Dr.  Dixon?
-She needs an ultrasound.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.640
She should have got it.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.280
Don't wait to be asked.
Act with foresight.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.640
- Careful, soldier.
- Actually, he's the soldier.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.560
-The pelvis is unstable.
-We'll give her medicine.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.080
-My pelvis is broken.
-How do you know?

05:27.240 --> 05:30.360
I was an emergency room nurse.
Even before there was such a thing.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.120
Besides, I heard it.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.720
Well then, Blanche, you
can still teach us something.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.640
That's right, George.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.040
The placenta is intact.
The amniotic fluid is sufficient.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.240
But the fetus's
pulse is a little slow.

05:45.240 --> 05:48.440
Call obstetrics.
We watch them for so long.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.920
Grab a cigar, she's in labor.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.520
Well, Blanche, you were right.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.120
Acetabular fracture and
sacroiliac joint disruption.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.920
I said yes.  That's a shame.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.440
I'm in, I've got it.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.240
Blanche, can we
call someone for you?

06:05.480 --> 06:09.680
My George died in the war.
I'm alone.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.080
-Jesse?
-She has to go to the Center Stage.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.160
Fast!

06:18.880 --> 06:20.040
What are you wearing there?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.960
Out of the way!  Watch out!

06:24.240 --> 06:27.200
Fifty-two year old with
propofol-induced bradycardia.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.600
-Jesse?
-She collapsed in the operation.

06:29.720 --> 06:35.080
Heart rate at 30, blood pressure at 60.
Atropine works, but not enough.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.480
Ready?  One two Three.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.000
Give, give.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.320
Please get the ambulance here.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.400
The pacemaker pads...

06:48.800 --> 06:50.480
-Where is the hospital bag?
-In the car.

06:51.120 --> 06:55.000
-We'll be staying here overnight.
-I'm going.  In the case.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.600
-Stop.  What floor is she on?
-Sixth.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.720
-Seventh.
- Seventh floor.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.480
Really now, Sugar Bears?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.760
-I know where your station is.
- "Sugar Bears"?

07:07.720 --> 07:09.080
Good, please reload.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.000
Who forgot to pay
the electricity bill?

07:17.720 --> 07:19.480
-That must be a joke.
-What's happening?

07:28.520 --> 07:29.640
Sisters!  The flashlights!

07:29.760 --> 07:30.720
I have it.

07:30.840 --> 07:31.840
Your pulse is weak.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.000
Please stay calm.  Do you hear

07:36.120 --> 07:37.240
-Hey!
- Quiet.

07:37.360 --> 07:41.160
Take it easy.  The emergency
generators come on at any moment.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.680
We need light in here!

08:05.800 --> 08:07.880
Has anyone reached Campbell?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.760
-You should go back to bed.
-I can not find my glasses.

08:11.880 --> 08:12.960
They weren't wearing any.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.200
-Why don't I see anything?
-Because the lights are off.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.760
Out of the way!
We want through.  Watch out!

08:19.880 --> 08:21.440
Why don't the emergency
generators come on?

08:21.560 --> 08:22.520
No idea.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.120
She still has bradycardia.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.440
Load the pacemaker.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.600
And get a new defibrillator
to be on the safe side.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.320
Good sisters!  Check the
batteries in the monitors.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.600
They don't last forever.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.880
Do you see what
happens here without you?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.720
-Good to see you back, mom.
-I'm not back.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.080
-Another dose of atropine.
-Come immediately.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.440
Here you go.

08:42.559 --> 08:43.799
Come on, Renee, hold on.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.080
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.680
Can someone please try
to contact Campbell again?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.160
I don't see anything.
Come closer.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.640
-Have you reached her?
-The pipes are tight.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.960
-Try further.
-The ventilator is out of order.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.920
Uncouple, ventilate manually
at 14 breaths per minute.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.640
I don't know if the
anesthesia will work.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.520
-Turn off the machine.
-What?

09:11.840 --> 09:15.400
Turn it off and give
propofol and fentanyl via drip.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.480
I am absolutely at a loss.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.960
You tell me the machine
is off, I offer the solution

09:19.720 --> 09:21.440
Are you switching to
intravenous propofol, understand?

09:21.640 --> 09:23.800
And check all batteries.
Come on guys, let's get started.

09:23.920 --> 09:24.880
Yes doctor

09:25.000 --> 09:26.520
-I have reached her.
-Thank God.  Emily?

09:26.640 --> 09:28.040
No dr  Rorish.  Via radio.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.360
I got your daughter's cell
phone.  The mailbox came.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.800
-Then the sitter!  Dr.  Rorish?
-I'm here.  How are you?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.960
I'm up to my elbow in an
operating room without electricity.

09:36.160 --> 09:37.120
What is the status report?

09:37.640 --> 09:41.840
I have 35 acute cases, 10 of
them critical.  Three are ventilated.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.640
50 beds are occupied.
Wait at least 80.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.480
The technicians have
not yet contacted us.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.960
What about the generators?

09:48.080 --> 09:51.280
Dr.  Rorish, they said on the radio
that a substation was overloaded.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.560
There is no electricity in all of L.A.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.680
The emergency generators have been
repaired since the heating explosion.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.480
Still?  That was months ago.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.600
-Take it.
-I got it.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.720
We have to redirect emergencies.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.360
We have to do more than that.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.760
We have no idea how long
we've been without power.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.880
We need to
evacuate all patients,

10:07.000 --> 10:08.120
starting with the most critical.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.920
Let's call the
Cedars, the UCLA...

10:10.080 --> 10:14.320
They'll be overrun and we'll
need 300 emergency vehicles.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.240
I suggest Peterson.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.400
An acute outpatient clinic?

10:19.280 --> 10:20.520
They're only eight blocks away.

10:20.640 --> 10:23.080
We are a level
1 accident clinic.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.280
But they have electricity,
because every hospital

10:24.400 --> 10:26.920
except ours obviously
has emergency electricity.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.160
Do you blame me?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.680
I only talk to the
man in charge.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.800
Then we do it like that.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.160
-One more thing.
-Yes?

10:36.240 --> 10:38.760
-Jesse is here.
-I beg your pardon?

10:39.520 --> 10:40.960
It's a long story.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.520
But he can help us
organize some things.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.600
We need all the help we can get.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.480
Leanne, he's not getting
involved in treatment.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.720
What did you expect?

10:53.280 --> 10:55.280
-Can you hear me?
-Understood.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.040
-Dr.  Nolan!
-Hi.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.840
Let me guess.  Have you
already operated in the dark?

11:10.960 --> 11:11.920
Under fire.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.560
Under fire, of course.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.840
Broken pelvis, confused,
ninety-two years old.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.640
Turn off the lights.
Turn off!  They'll see us!

11:22.760 --> 11:25.840
-This is just a blackout.
-I heard the air raid alarm.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.600
-These are the ambulances.
-Hi, Blanche.  I am dr  Nolan.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.840
Doctor?  You mean sister.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.760
Fascinating.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.760
George, if they see
us, they'll attack us.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.720
How does that feel?  That hurts?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.520
We have to move these people!

11:43.640 --> 11:45.160
Listen, you mustn't move.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.040
Your pelvic fracture is bad
enough, that makes it worse.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.400
-Do you understand?
-My pelvis is broken?

11:52.520 --> 11:56.760
-Do you know where you are?
-Fort Stevens.

11:57.400 --> 12:01.840
-I'm sister.  ANC.
-Will you tell me the date?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.320
It's June '42.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.080
I don't know the exact date,
it's hard to keep track of.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.160
The 21st?

12:09.280 --> 12:11.120
That... that could be.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.520
George, how many are injured?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.800
Dr.  Willis in the
waiting area, please.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.920
-Are you going.  I stay here.
-OK.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.040
Blanche, I'll be right back.
Wait here with Dr.  Nolan.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.760
George, don't leave me, George.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.240
Go back again.
John, hold the door open.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.320
Leanne?

12:32.280 --> 12:33.680
We evacuate everyone

12:33.880 --> 12:36.200
except for the most critical cases,
to an acute care clinic nearby.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.680
My pelvic fracture Blanche
cannot be relocated.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.400
She has pale conjunctiva
and a hard stomach.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.920
Internal bleeding.
Campbell is on the way.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.200
There are other critical
cases that cannot be relocated.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.600
I stay with them.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.040
This is my ship,
I'll go down with it.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.360
-We are not going down.
-I'm going to the Peterson's now.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.560
Look for Dr.  Carrie,
the hospital manager.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.080
You only have a small team
here.  Get Jesse involved.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.880
And provoke Campbell in the process?
Why should I do that?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.240
There are hardly any
emergency vehicles and we

13:08.360 --> 13:10.000
help the less acute
cases to get there on foot.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.360
-A lot of people.
-There is emergency supply, radio...

13:13.480 --> 13:15.960
and the world's best sisters,
what else do we need?

13:16.600 --> 13:19.960
Folks, follow me!
Off to the promised land!

13:26.680 --> 13:27.920
Your blood pressure is still low.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.040
More fluid!  I attach a drip.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.960
You shouldn't have
brought her here.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.560
The trauma department
has been closed and diverted.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.040
Tell that to L.A.
We have Code Blackout.

13:38.440 --> 13:43.440
-Risa, a dopamine drop!
-You are not allowed to order anything.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.040
Your blood pressure drops.
Would you like to help me?

13:47.320 --> 13:49.520
Let me do that.
Sisters do that.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.400
You don't work here.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.120
Risa, where's the dopamine?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.040
It won't open.
The output is out of order.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.920
-Where is the manual key?
-I do that.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.480
Forgiveness.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.240
Fast.  Excuse me.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.280
Keep up.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.480
Hey i can't find my wife

14:18.040 --> 14:20.680
-They were taken to the L&D.
-No, I say yes.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.760
She is not there.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.560
She's having our child, the
power went out, I can't find her.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.080
She has our child!

14:27.280 --> 14:28.240
Hello?

14:29.040 --> 14:30.120
Still no cell phone reception?

14:30.240 --> 14:32.600
Isn't there usually
emergency power in hospitals?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.240
Elliot, let's check your status.

14:38.720 --> 14:39.680
Station?

14:40.160 --> 14:41.840
Oh right  Station.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.280
-What's happening?
-Oh, crap.  You can see the head.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.560
Well, your baby is coming now.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.720
Now?

14:52.240 --> 14:55.320
I can't have the baby
here without Richard.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.680
And without a birth plan.
What do we do now?

14:57.800 --> 15:00.800
You will help us if you keep
calm.  You too, Sugar Bear.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.440
25 patients have already
come and were reassessed.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.560
The rest are still on the way.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.160
Good.  We don't yet know
when we will get electricity again.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.360
Dr.  Rorish,

15:19.880 --> 15:21.480
i am dr  Carrie.
The hospital manager.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.960
-Thank you for welcoming us.
-I like to help.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.560
I have to admit that we are not

15:25.680 --> 15:27.280
equipped for this high
number of patients.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.320
Will you bring every mobile
monitor we have here, please?

15:30.040 --> 15:32.000
Our patients should
be examined first.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.680
We examine the patients
according to urgency.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.120
It doesn't matter whether you
come from Angels or from here.

15:40.720 --> 15:41.680
Sounds good.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.280
Hey, please leave a message.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.400
Is your daughter well?

16:02.880 --> 16:03.840
How do you know?

16:05.920 --> 16:08.080
-I know concerned fathers.
-Oh well,

16:08.240 --> 16:09.600
I can't reach her or the sitter.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Hello?  Hello?

16:15.240 --> 16:18.240
-Jesse?
-They are at the Angels Memorial.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.360
There was a complication
in your procedure.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.240
-What?
-And we have a blackout.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.840
But everything will be fine.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.040
Did Dr.  Silverman
finished the operation?

16:31.360 --> 16:32.760
I'm sorry no

16:42.640 --> 16:44.920
What was special on June 21st?

16:45.720 --> 16:46.680
You seemed to know?

16:46.960 --> 16:50.160
The only attack on
a US base in WWII.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.920
Fort Stevens, June 21, 1942.
A Japanese submarine.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.400
-She must have been there.
-She still is.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.920
She is currently an
Army nurse in WWII.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.080
Your dementia is
like a time machine.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.480
Brush up on tetanus
vaccination and give ibuprofen.

17:05.599 --> 17:06.800
I don't think it's dementia.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.720
She might fantasize
about the loss of blood.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.280
See, next to the kidney.
This is blood.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
Great.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.760
Have you ever
operated on someone?

17:17.960 --> 17:21.000
I once assisted in an
umbilical hernia operation.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.440
I'm a psychiatrist,
not a surgeon.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.800
Don't worry about me

17:26.920 --> 17:29.400
Help the others.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.920
I can operate, but I need
the equipment from above.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.560
There are eight flights
of stairs, we have to walk.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.200
Eight stairs.  We going to make that.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.440
Slowly.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.720
Just one small push
could bleed her to death.

17:44.960 --> 17:48.320
George, you always
worry too much.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.200
Is Mr. Rothbarth one of yours?

17:58.320 --> 18:00.320
The nurses accidentally
gave me his CT.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.160
He fell, hit his head.
He came before the power cut.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.960
-Not good.  An epidural hematoma.
-Yes, a brain hemorrhage.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.400
Please call the neurosurgeon.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.760
You don't have time for it.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.840
He has to drill a hole.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.640
We are waiting for
the neurosurgeon.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.400
He's probably out
somewhere in L.A.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.760
- There is also a power failure with him.
-The patient does not cramp,

18:15.920 --> 18:17.120
he is alert and responsive.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.600
You said it was
a little bleeding.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.160
Right now, but it
could get bigger.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.760
We'd better resolve it
before something happens.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.760
Dr.  Rorish, I'm the boss
here, we do what I say.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.080
With all due respect, you
are not used to this, but I am.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.160
I give him mannitol

18:30.520 --> 18:33.880
and a nicardipine drop to
lower intracranial pressure

18:34.080 --> 18:35.920
that gives us time until
the specialist is here.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.520
Only when that doesn't work
do we take extreme measures.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.240
Thank you.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.360
Are you checking the closure
of the chest tube, bed 3?

18:48.480 --> 18:50.400
Dr.  Leighton,
dislocated shoulder.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.640
Let's put it here and
give it 5 units of morphine.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.120
You doctors from the Angels
seem to be doing nicely.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.760
I feel really strange.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.600
-Here.  There you are.
-So.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.800
-Kelly Pruitt.
-Angus Leighton.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.040
No more monitors, so
it is examined manually.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.120
I will help you.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.200
OK.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.160
Have you felt dizzy recently?

19:14.680 --> 19:16.400
No, it started three nights ago.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.880
I became extremely
weak and slept a lot.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.520
-The lungs are fine.
-The pulse is a little weak.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.680
Are there any chronic complaints?

19:25.200 --> 19:27.800
I only eat organic,
drink tea instead

19:27.920 --> 19:29.080
of coffee, I do
Pilates every day.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.120
Dr.  Pruitt, do you feel that?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.200
What is wrong with me?

19:39.040 --> 19:42.360
You have an irregular pulse
and you need a monitor.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.640
Thank you.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.400
-What's happening?
-The baby is stuck.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.640
I want to try it.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.920
What's happening?

20:00.720 --> 20:02.240
-Hey, hello?
-We are in here.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.880
-Serena?
-Richard!  Yes!  I'm here!

20:05.040 --> 20:07.720
Thank God!  I've been looking
for you everywhere.  All is well?

20:07.840 --> 20:08.800
The baby is coming!

20:09.080 --> 20:10.240
In the elevator?

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
Is the baby well?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.280
Say yes.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.680
You have to find a way
to get us out of here, okay?

20:22.320 --> 20:25.400
Everything that is important to
me in this world is behind the door.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.320
I'll get you out of there!

20:29.440 --> 20:31.080
If I pull more, I'll
break my collarbone.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.840
How did they make it
through the minefields?

20:38.960 --> 20:42.400
-We have to warn Astoria.
-Calm down, Blanche.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.320
You know what?
Let's put them down here briefly.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.000
They're still shooting
at us with grenades!

20:47.200 --> 20:50.120
Nobody shoots us.
They didn't attack anyone else.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.360
How do you know?

20:53.440 --> 20:55.040
Because it happened
over 70 years ago.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.800
She's passed out.
It's the blood loss.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.160
Play the game along.

21:01.960 --> 21:05.440
-What do you mean?
-She is just in 1942.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.600
Under heavy fire and
that's what bothers you.

21:07.720 --> 21:08.720
I would not be so sure about that.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.560
Have you ever been under fire?

21:10.760 --> 21:14.240
No, but you, and
I think you miss it.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.960
That's why you take part
in all emergency vehicle

21:17.080 --> 21:19.760
operations because you
need the adrenaline rush.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.840
I go with you to
give a glimmer of

21:21.960 --> 21:22.960
hope to people who
would otherwise die.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.840
It has nothing to do
with wanting back.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.040
You've been talking about wanting
to go back since you've been here.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.960
I left good people behind...

21:30.760 --> 21:32.600
Or you think you
are still there yourself.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.640
Is that what you meant
when you said you were dead.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.600
I am not your patient, doctor.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.440
No, but you can
talk to me about it.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.640
We should hurry.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.200
George...

21:49.640 --> 21:51.560
Are we firing at them?

21:51.680 --> 21:52.640
George...

21:53.280 --> 21:54.680
Try it.  For her.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.160
It will comfort you.

21:57.880 --> 21:58.840
I'm here, Blanche.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.480
We didn't return fire
because their shooters didn't

22:07.000 --> 22:09.760
should know our position.
The base is secure.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.880
If you can meet
us here at home...

22:15.000 --> 22:16.520
What shall we do now?

22:16.720 --> 22:18.560
She's diaphoretic,
she's in shock.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.080
For some, blackouts
are just a nuisance, but

22:23.200 --> 22:26.200
for the patients at
Angels Memorial, it can

22:26.320 --> 22:29.520
-decide about their survival.
-Continue.  We are nearly there.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.800
-Why are you here?
-This is personal.

22:35.960 --> 22:41.120
A piranha is eating me
from the inside.  Very slowly.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.960
I think I...

22:47.720 --> 22:48.800
Are you all right?

22:50.640 --> 22:52.160
She has a piranha!

22:53.800 --> 22:54.800
Over here.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.160
Could you get up, please?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.240
Probably a torsion
of the ovary.  The

22:59.360 --> 23:00.680
power went out
before the ultrasound.

23:01.720 --> 23:02.800
The pulse is weak.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.480
I feel a great pulsatile mass.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.000
-An aortic aneurysm?
-Yes.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.840
-For sure?
-Yes.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.680
I believe.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.240
-She has to go to the Peterson.
-It can tear at any moment.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.320
We should sit down.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.480
We are in a hurry.  Come on.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.960
Get out of the way, go.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.040
Watch out...

23:22.800 --> 23:25.240
-He has a brain hemorrhage!
-I know.  I found the drill.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.560
-We need lidocaine!
-You do this here?

23:28.680 --> 23:29.640
You can bet on that.

23:35.560 --> 23:37.240
Its pupils are rigid
and dilated.  Stop.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.560
Come on, Mr. Rothbarth.  Come on!

23:43.040 --> 23:44.000
It is too late.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.120
Time of death, 9:38 p.m.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.440
Let's go.  Sorry.
Out of the way!

24:13.760 --> 24:16.800
-Tina?
-Mario!  Do not stop!

24:16.920 --> 24:19.120
She's losing her pulse.
The aneurysm has ruptured.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.960
She has to go to the Petersons.
We'll be there in 5 minutes.

24:21.080 --> 24:23.120
We don't have 5 minutes.
She's losing too much blood.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.360
Bring me the Ambu bag,
tweezers, and scalpel.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.920
What do you want
to do  You open here?

24:31.040 --> 24:33.600
Your aneurysm has ruptured,
we need to stop the bleeding.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.120
-That's crazy.
-It's your only chance.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.600
Hey

24:41.440 --> 24:43.840
Stop!  A medical emergency!

24:43.960 --> 24:45.040
What?

24:46.400 --> 24:47.520
We'll do it in the emergency vehicle!

24:57.000 --> 25:00.400
-What's happening?  The baby!
-Only the monitor failed.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.120
-Richard!
-Serena, are you okay?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.680
-The baby is stuck.
-What do you mean by that?

25:11.080 --> 25:13.800
-How about a caesarean section?
-In the elevator?

25:15.560 --> 25:19.960
-We don't have the tools.
-Oxygen, lido, scalpel.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.440
-A symphysiotomy.
-I never heard of that.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.680
Because this is a
medieval, outdated practice.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.080
-Have you done that before?
-No.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.640
-Then we won't do it either.
-I'll get the material.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.240
It's our only chance.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.840
We'll cut off the
cartilage of your pelvic

25:38.960 --> 25:40.720
joint so we can stretch
it and bring your baby.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.080
-Inject the lidocaine.
-Make a moment.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.880
-Is that the only solution?
-Yes.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.040
Let's go.  Just save our
baby.  You're welcome!

25:59.480 --> 26:03.520
-George?
-I'm there.  How are you?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.960
You have to stay awake.
Put them down.  Good.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.880
Blanche, you have to stay awake.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.160
George?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.560
Tell me again
about our first date.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.360
I don't remember it anymore.

26:26.760 --> 26:32.440
Men right?
We went to the cinema in Astoria.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.880
What movie did we see?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.560
Breaking weather.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.240
It was a depressing movie.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.640
And then we went for
a walk on the beach.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.720
Who walks on the beach at night?

26:51.120 --> 26:52.880
The beach is peaceful at night.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.920
It was raining, we were
all wet, but we didn't care.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.840
You've kissed me.

27:02.360 --> 27:05.920
The beach in the rain.
It couldn't be more romantic.

27:07.160 --> 27:14.120
I should close my eyes and
count backwards from five.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.400
And at three you kissed me.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.960
He is very brisk.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.200
It was a perfect moment.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.520
There aren't many of them.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.440
I think we should move on.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.160
Another floor.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.760
I need an emergency car here!

27:45.360 --> 27:47.800
Give me an ampoule
of Epi and charge 360.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.920
Moment.  Dr.  Pruitt.
Do you see that U-wave?

27:52.320 --> 27:53.720
Isn't that a bad baseline?

27:53.840 --> 27:56.480
-Yes.  Bad potassium levels.
-How do you know that?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.000
That explains the symptoms.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.560
Dehydration, viral
infections and pregnancy too.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.600
Do you smell that?
This is licorice root tea.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.600
Licorice promotes the
excretion of potassium.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.920
-Which affects the heart.
-She drinks it by the liter.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.840
If she is pumped full of potassium,
her heart will stop if we are wrong.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.640
Can you see it.  You
focus on the wrong thing.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.920
Think about the symptoms.
You tell us what it is.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.480
You need to look
at the bigger picture.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.400
Okay, we're hanging
a wide open drip.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.920
Good.  That will work.
I promise it.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.000
Come on.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.120
There is the sine curve.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.120
How are you?

28:50.320 --> 28:53.240
-My chest hurts.
-Because you were shocked.

28:54.960 --> 28:55.920
And my pride.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.360
Dr.  Silverman said
I could be perfect.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.400
You don't understand.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.200
Impossible.  I'm 52 and divorced

29:09.800 --> 29:12.720
and now I'm 52,
divorced and boobless.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.720
-I just want...
-You want to be you again.

29:20.280 --> 29:24.360
-And a little Uma too.
-In dangerous love affairs.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.200
Dr.  Campbell!

29:33.160 --> 29:34.120
What?

29:34.920 --> 29:37.840
Your pulse is racing.
Stay calm.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.080
Jesse, I can't breathe.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.480
I don't know if it's SVT,
atrial fibrillation, VF...

29:43.600 --> 29:45.120
I'm literally
groping in the dark.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.760
-Wait.
-I need the monitor!

29:48.320 --> 29:51.120
Hurry up, guys, before
she has a heart attack.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.360
Dr.  Campbell.  Breathe.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.520
With the wrong medication,
she can get a heart rate of 300.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.840
There you are.  The QRS complex
looks tight and steady.  SVT.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.480
-I need adenosine.
-Come immediately.

30:03.040 --> 30:06.040
Renee, this will make your
heart stop beating for a moment.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.440
It's like restarting.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.360
Enter 12 mg.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.760
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you, okay?

30:12.840 --> 30:13.800
Hold on, okay?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.160
It worked.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.800
She now needs an
oral dose of metoprolol.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.160
Everything is fine with her.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.120
And a big blood test
when the power returns.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.480
I was talking about your daughter.
She is a smart child.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.080
Strong, like her dad.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.720
There!  I have my
hand on the aorta!

30:49.160 --> 30:50.920
-Why are we stopping?
-There is a traffic jam.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.000
Noa, concentrate.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.040
-Please put on the clamp.
-I?

30:55.840 --> 30:56.800
You can do that.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.520
Slide your hand along
the back of the thorax.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.800
I agree.  We have to go on!

31:04.920 --> 31:06.080
-Now!
-Moment!

31:14.120 --> 31:15.080
Dr.  Rorish!

31:16.520 --> 31:18.640
Ruptured aneurysm.
We put clamps on outside.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.640
-You operated on the street?
-No, in the ambulance.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.200
Why was a thoracotomy
indicated on the street?

31:24.640 --> 31:26.600
She had a large pulsatile
mass and lost her pulse.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.800
It was her only chance.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.880
She needs an operation.  Where?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.640
-We don't have an operating room.
-Then an exam room.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.600
We are not surgeons.
She neither.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.640
I hear that a lot.
But we can do it.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.040
-There is no other way.
-It's hardly sterile there.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.480
"Sterile" is nothing
here for a long time.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.760
I wonder where
they got that from.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.680
-Dr.  Rorish...
- She doesn't need a cowboy.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.720
She just needs a cowboy.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.880
Either put your
spurs on or avoid me.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.600
Serena!  What's happening?
Is she OK?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.560
I cut down to the cartilage.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.560
You will now feel pressure.
Now press the baby out.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.640
I'll do it.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.800
Serena, no matter
what, just hold still.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.880
Infant!  Our birth playlist!

32:14.560 --> 32:15.680
I am cutting now.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.560
They are all crazy.  And
very good at what you do.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.400
That's true.  But let's
never do that again.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.200
There's a lot of blood here.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.960
Your hypogastric artery must
be ruptured, venous plexus.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.200
She will never get
through this operation.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.360
George.

34:03.680 --> 34:04.800
I'm here, Blanche.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.440
I know that you will leave me

34:11.560 --> 34:14.639
You will go to Europe and fight.

34:15.080 --> 34:20.679
I would never admit it in front of
the other women.  Please stay there.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.760
I'm here, Blanche.

34:26.639 --> 34:30.159
Promise me...
promise you will return.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.960
I do not want to live without you.

34:40.280 --> 34:43.520
George, I'm scared.
I'm scared, George.

34:51.960 --> 34:57.240
Blanche, everything is fine.
Look at me.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.720
So.

35:04.040 --> 35:08.000
Now close your eyes,
close your eyes...

35:12.400 --> 35:14.080
And count backwards from five.

35:16.080 --> 35:22.720
Five, four, three...

35:52.000 --> 35:53.200
You're with George now.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.480
I would avoid licorice.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.720
Your machine is
much better than ours.

36:27.240 --> 36:30.720
Thanks for your help.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.320
You could have done it yourself.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.280
That's sweet.  And lied.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.640
They were miles ahead
of me in diagnosis.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.560
Years ago I was
offered a job at Angels.

36:43.440 --> 36:46.480
-I refused.
-For real?  How so?

36:48.440 --> 36:51.200
Being a great doctor
is a 24 hour job.

36:52.120 --> 36:55.360
Read the latest journals
about practices and research.

36:56.760 --> 36:59.080
I chose to be a good doctor.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.400
You chose the other way.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.800
Dr.  Pruitt...

37:09.840 --> 37:11.120
Would you like to
have a coffee with me?

37:11.600 --> 37:12.560
Or tea?

37:14.040 --> 37:16.240
For sure.  That sounds good.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.920
Listen about this today

37:27.400 --> 37:28.920
I would never have put you in

37:29.040 --> 37:30.240
this situation if it
wasn't necessary.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.320
OK.

37:31.440 --> 37:36.960
Last year I forced Angus
to have a dry thoracotomy.

37:38.920 --> 37:39.880
It was the wrong decision.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.560
I think about it a lot.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.840
You were afraid.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.120
I did not say that.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.920
I...
just to make one thing clear...

37:55.800 --> 37:56.880
I'm still not flirting.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.720
No.

38:03.880 --> 38:04.840
What the hell was that

38:04.960 --> 38:06.680
I think Ken just passed
the kidney stone.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.440
-I'll check.
-Yes.

38:18.400 --> 38:21.040
She loved him all her life.
She never got over it.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.160
No, that is right.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.480
The mind is cruel.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.880
Yes, sometimes.

38:30.280 --> 38:33.320
But in the end, he took
her to the place she wanted.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.280
To the person with
whom she felt safe.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.400
Looks like.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.240
But living without this
person is the problem.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.400
Good.  Let's go back down.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.200
This is your daughter

39:10.120 --> 39:11.080
She is perfect.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.520
Good job dr.  Dixon.

39:20.880 --> 39:21.840
Thank you.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.400
You looked better
when the lights were out.

39:31.520 --> 39:32.480
I?

39:33.320 --> 39:35.800
It looks like you've mopped
the floor with your hair.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.360
Are you already going?

39:40.360 --> 39:43.120
-I thought that...
-I miss you too.

39:43.760 --> 39:44.920
But I don't work here.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.840
I finally reached Emily.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.160
She is safe.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.600
That's nice to hear.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.440
Yes.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.120
Look Jesse

39:56.560 --> 39:58.600
-We had our problems...
-And I would rather have

39:58.720 --> 40:00.040
with Dr.  Guthrie should speak.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.000
It's my fault that
he didn't hold back.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.840
Rollie deserved the trust bonus.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.120
And she too.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.200
I acted out of anger

40:12.200 --> 40:14.080
and you especially
deserve better.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.280
I want to offer
you your old job.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.760
So you want your mom back?

40:28.320 --> 40:30.480
I did not say that.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.160
Tell me.  Come on.
I want to hear it.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.240
Jesse...

40:34.600 --> 40:35.800
I will not say that.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.840
If he doesn't say
it, I won't be back.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.920
-Until tomorrow.
-Don't be shy.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.800
Tell me already.
I want to hear it.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.160
I want my mom back.
