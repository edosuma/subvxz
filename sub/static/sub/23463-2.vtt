'It seemed to us in 1963

00:36.360 --> 00:40.480
'as though the world was spinning
a little faster on its axis.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.790
'We bought new things,
followed new trends,

00:44.840 --> 00:48.070
'sought at every turn a more vibrant,

00:48.120 --> 00:51.110
'vivid version of our homes,

00:51.160 --> 00:53.830
'our lives, ourselves.

00:53.880 --> 00:58.990
'Our energy and thirst for
change seemed limitless.

00:59.040 --> 01:02.520
'We wanted to be the very
best that we could be.'

01:11.440 --> 01:13.640
That's not your usual reading.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.230
Sister, are you sure you
wouldn't like to join us?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.990
Wool crafts are the refuge of a dull mind.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.750
I must say I was rather dubious
when I received the pattern,

01:24.800 --> 01:27.670
but these knitted bosoms will
be just the job for teaching

01:27.720 --> 01:29.840
breast-feeding in my Mothercraft class.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.990
Mine looks terribly realistic.
I'm actually rather proud of it.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.440
- Looking forward to seeing you. Bye.
- Ooh, my back.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.430
Oi, wake up.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.310
It's a salon, not a dosshouse.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.830
Oh, sorry, Mae. I don't do well on nights.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.910
Still, at least I've
got today to catch up.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.950
Hear that, Marj? You'll have to
wait till tomorrow if you want Val to

01:53.000 --> 01:55.590
- deliver you. - I don't think
I can hold off that long.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.590
- You getting twinges? - Bit more
than that. - You're in labour?

01:58.640 --> 02:01.790
Look, I reckon I can get through
my afternoon ladies without any

02:01.840 --> 02:05.390
excitement. I mean, I was going,
what, three days with them two.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.550
Besides, Mum don't let you have
a day off for a little thing

02:08.600 --> 02:10.310
like having a baby. Do you, Mum?

02:10.360 --> 02:12.430
Well, you'll only be sitting upstairs.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.590
Plenty of time for that
when the kid comes.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.630
You watch, right -- she'll have
me back down here inside a week.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.750
- I will!
- Ooh... Ooh!

02:21.800 --> 02:24.870
Ooh, sorry, Marj. Looks like it's
time to hang up your scissors.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.080
- Mae, can you call Nonnatus?
- Yeah.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.070
- Oh, I'll give you a hand with
that, Sister. - Thank you, Fred.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.310
Blimey! Iced buns?

02:35.360 --> 02:37.790
It's breast-feeding night
at Mothercraft class.

02:37.840 --> 02:41.150
I had hoped to borrow Nurse
Crane's car to transport my props.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.790
But unfortunately it's not convenient.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.230
She's become rather
over-protective of her clutch.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.190
Ah, well, that can be expensive if...

02:48.640 --> 02:50.910
Perhaps I can borrow your van.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.800
I've got an errand to run, but
I can drop you off on the way.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.150
Sergeant Woolf.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.590
I appreciate the power of
the whistle more than most,

03:06.640 --> 03:09.910
but I find its efficacy
is decreased by overuse.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.070
I'm obliged to inform you that
there have been a number of car

03:13.120 --> 03:14.910
thefts in the vicinity.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.350
You might want to take
the relevant precautions.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.910
I always keep the keys
in a safe place, Sergeant.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.990
Thank you for the intelligence.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.360
I'll bear it in mind.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.280
You'll find nothing amiss!

03:35.120 --> 03:36.320
Oh!

03:41.760 --> 03:43.200
Iced buns.

03:46.840 --> 03:50.120
Get those curlers out or she'll
look like she's just off the boat.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.960
Midwife.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.400
To see a Mrs Chivvers?

03:58.840 --> 04:00.560
Upstairs. I'll take you.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.240
What are you lot goggling at?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.400
That's it. Lean into it.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.040
Midwife's here.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.670
Nurse Anderson, this is Marjory Chivvers.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.600
- Hello, Mrs Chivvers.
- Marjory'll do.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.790
Mae, why don't you take over here

04:22.840 --> 04:25.200
while I bring my colleague up to speed?

04:28.120 --> 04:30.950
Two previous deliveries,
both straightforward.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.840
Textbook pregnancy this time too.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.790
Now, Marjory's in school.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.470
Biggest complication is likely to
be the mother. Bit of a character.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.430
Mrs Chivvers, once this contraction
has passed, can you lie down, please?

04:45.480 --> 04:48.430
- I need to examine you.
- Who died and made her the boss?

04:48.480 --> 04:50.670
Look, if you're going be
funny, you can clear off!

04:50.720 --> 04:53.350
- Can't no-one take a joke these days?
- Right, Mae.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.110
Why don't you get back down to the salon?

04:55.160 --> 04:57.360
I ain't going nowhere.
And neither are you.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.950
Then, why don't we pop
through to the kitchen

05:01.000 --> 05:02.710
and you can make me a cuppa?

05:03.560 --> 05:05.680
You'll be close at hand if you're needed.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.030
Baby's mouth needs to come up and over,

05:19.080 --> 05:21.070
rather than attach straight on.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.190
- That's it, Mrs Romaine. Lovely.
- Thanks, Sister.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.150
Well done, everyone. Next
week we'll be tackling nappies,

05:27.200 --> 05:30.950
along with what to expect in the
immediate aftermath of the birth.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.100
Does that include the bit on how
to get your fella out of the pub?

05:35.140 --> 05:37.910
Sorry, Norma. That's not
my area of expertise.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.190
Mine neither, Sister. My
Alan's not a big drinker.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.590
He likes to keep himself
fit, what with him

05:43.640 --> 05:45.670
being the coach of the
Fairborough Under-16s.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.590
Oh, is he? You didn't say.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.150
Nothing wrong with being married
to a man you can be proud of!

05:50.200 --> 05:51.710
Well, if he's so marvellous,

05:51.760 --> 05:53.430
you should get him down to the next class,

05:53.480 --> 05:55.630
train him up in changing
the dirty nappies.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.790
- Maybe I will. He's keen to learn.
- Oh, you're having a laugh!

05:58.840 --> 06:01.630
What's funny about a man being
involved in raising his child?

06:01.680 --> 06:05.590
There's nothing funny
about it, Mrs Romaine.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.680
Nothing at all.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.950
Oooh!... That's it.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.150
Oooh!

06:14.200 --> 06:17.350
Just relax there until
you're ready to push again.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.910
Not long to go now, Mrs Chivvers.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.110
How many times have I got to
tell you -- just call me Marj.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.790
How about we split the
difference and settle on Marjory?

06:25.840 --> 06:27.200
All right, then.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.430
- Another one coming?
- Ooh, yeah!

06:32.480 --> 06:35.150
Is, is Dennis home? I just
need to know that he's here.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.030
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

06:38.580 --> 06:39.390
Let's get you onto the bed.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.950
Oh, Dennis! Dennis!

06:44.000 --> 06:47.360
Don't know what she's shouting
for him for -- useless lump.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.550
- There's a lot worse than that.
- Tell me about it.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.350
Don't think I ever met Mr Stanton?

06:54.400 --> 06:58.390
23 years ago he went to the second
showing at the Palais Cinema,

06:58.440 --> 07:00.080
never came home.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.470
Was it the Blitz that took him?

07:03.520 --> 07:05.710
No, one of the usherettes.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.550
Off they ran, leaving me with a toddler

07:09.600 --> 07:12.760
- and a dose of something itchy.
- The toddler was Marjory?

07:14.800 --> 07:17.070
We did all right, just the two of us.

07:17.620 --> 07:18.710
Who needs them?

07:20.360 --> 07:21.730
I came as soon I heard!

07:22.080 --> 07:25.750
- How is she?
- Doing just fine without you.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.440
Dennis!

07:36.760 --> 07:41.030
Come on, then, let's have a
look at her. Who's she look like?

07:41.080 --> 07:43.110
She looks like Dennis. She's a boy!

07:43.160 --> 07:46.550
- We don't do boys.
- Yeah, well, we do now.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.270
And if you want this one in the trade,

07:48.320 --> 07:50.390
you better open up a barber shop!

07:50.440 --> 07:54.510
Well, come on, then. Do you want
to look at your little brother?

07:54.560 --> 07:56.960
I told you we'd get our
little man in the end.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.720
Oh, Marj! Hello!

08:08.080 --> 08:10.800
Don't get much better
than this, does it, girl?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.720
Alexandra. Night-night.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.870
You're very important to her.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.360
To both of us.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.830
I love the time the three
of us spend together.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.110
When do you think we might get away again?

08:35.159 --> 08:37.590
If you're free tomorrow evening,

08:37.640 --> 08:40.669
I might be able to find a way for
us to spend a little time together.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.270
Oh?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.200
7:30 sharp, and don't be late.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.710
Nice hair! Vidal Sassoon?

08:56.760 --> 08:58.670
Stanton's Styles.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.820
Marjory Chivvers had her baby
while I was getting my hair done.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.910
Oooh. "Home Management'"?

09:08.960 --> 09:10.430
My parents tried their best,

09:10.480 --> 09:14.470
but domestic science wasn't really
on the syllabus at Casa Mia.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.230
"Budgeting"? "Household routine"?

09:17.280 --> 09:19.350
Something to tell me, Nurse Franklin?

09:19.400 --> 09:21.750
What are you inferring, Nurse Dyer?

09:21.800 --> 09:25.110
"Advice on Entertaining
with information on weddings

09:25.160 --> 09:27.270
"and christenings." Hmmmm.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.230
I'm afraid you're getting rather
ahead of yourself. However, it is

09:31.280 --> 09:34.190
true that Mr Dockerill and I
are getting along splendidly.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.430
Which is why I'm cooking
for him tomorrow evening.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.830
Ah.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.310
- And just when it was all
going so well. - Cheeky!

09:42.360 --> 09:45.270
I've been known to boil
an egg with great success.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.680
Now, if you don't mind,
I need to devise my menu.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.910
I'm ever so pleased for you.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.280
Mr Dockerill is quite the catch.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.390
Not so long ago I thought
I'd never be happy again.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.920
And yet here I am.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.120
The human heart really is most resilient.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.190
Let's hope Mr Dockerill's
stomach is similarly robust.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.710
We prepare our ladies for
parenthood, but the fathers are

10:14.760 --> 10:17.870
left to their own devices and are
often quite at sea when baby's born.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.350
So I thought I might open the
next session to husbands.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.950
Men? In a Mothercraft class?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.590
Not every week, obviously.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.430
Perhaps just one session out of
the six that the women attend.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.950
And only if we're all agreed
that it's a good idea.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.080
I'm not sure.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.350
Those classes are a place
where women can relax,

10:37.400 --> 10:40.390
escape the pressures of family.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.430
Yes, but if a man can help
his wife with childcare,

10:44.480 --> 10:47.950
then she might also get some time
to relax when the baby comes.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.110
Sister Monica Joan, what is
your opinion of the matter?

10:52.160 --> 10:54.950
- There's much of value in
the old ways... - Exactly!

10:55.000 --> 10:58.750
.. but one must not
become like Lot's wife,

10:58.800 --> 11:02.240
frozen in the act of looking backwards.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.320
Then it seems there is a
majority in favour of the scheme.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.510
So, the au pair...

11:19.560 --> 11:21.710
According to this, she'll
be here this evening.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.110
Will you be able to pick her
up from the railway station?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.590
Of course.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.230
Though I've no idea how
I'll recognise her.

11:28.280 --> 11:32.350
There won't be that many Hungarians
arriving on the 5:15 into Victoria.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.230
I don't imagine she'll
be wearing national dress.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.760
Well, in case she's not,
she's sent a photograph.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.430
She does look rather stern.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.350
She grew up in a Communist country.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.950
I doubt that's conducive
to a cheerful disposition.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.430
Then she'll get on well with Timothy.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.750
He's been very glum about having
a stranger living in the house.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.950
I'm sure he'll warm to the idea.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.750
He'll have to.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.480
Miss Magdalena Kovacs is already
halfway across the English Channel.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.630
- Congratulations, Mae.
- Thanks, love.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.190
- All right, Mae?
- All right, Val?

12:13.240 --> 12:16.350
I brought a little present for the
baby. Can I drop it up to Marjory?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.270
- One of your lot's already up there.
- Ah, Nurse Anderson.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.110
Yeah, the foreign one.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.470
I've seen her type on the
buses, but I've never seen

12:23.520 --> 12:25.870
one in a... midwife's uniform.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.510
Actually there are lots of
Caribbean nurses in England.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.550
- Ah. - We didn't have enough, so
the Government asked them to come

12:31.600 --> 12:35.350
- over to help us
care for our own. - Oh.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.070
- Ah, hello, girls.
- Hello, Auntie Val.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.550
Only I heard she's not a proper midwife.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.190
Someone told me she used
to work in a library.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.230
Hmm, that's right.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.950
Then she came to England,
trained for four years

12:49.000 --> 12:52.670
and passed all her nursing and
midwifery exams with flying colours.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.630
Oh. Maybe I should set them
rumours straight, then.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.110
Yeah, you should.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.160
- I'll go on up, shall I?
- Yeah.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.590
Look at him.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.910
Dennis could have spat him out.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.550
I think they all look like their fathers.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.990
Nature's way of reassuring a man
that the child is really his.

13:14.340 --> 13:16.640
You saying my daughter's
been round the houses?

13:17.320 --> 13:19.480
I don't know how people
behave where you come from

13:19.530 --> 13:22.150
but you're in England
now. We're civilised.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.240
Mum!

13:24.360 --> 13:27.230
I'm sorry, it's not
because you're coloured,

13:27.280 --> 13:30.560
she's just a bit of a cow to everyone.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.510
It's nothing much.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.230
Just a little rattle, and
Mum knitted a cardie.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.320
Oh, how kind!

13:40.800 --> 13:44.920
Oh, will you thank her for
me? Mum's just off downstairs.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.990
Valerie, your timing is excellent.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.630
Baby needs a cuddle while I
retake mother's blood pressure.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.080
- It's a little high.
- Come on, then, Denny.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.270
Here, I think he's filling out already!

14:02.320 --> 14:04.110
He feeds like a champ.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.830
You know, he had me up
every two hours last night.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.910
That'll be good for your milk supply.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.390
Tell me about it. I think
I could stock a dairy!

14:11.440 --> 14:14.230
And a florist's. These are lovely.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.190
Oh, yeah, carnations.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.110
We had an April wedding and I had a
big bunch of them in my bouquet...

14:19.160 --> 14:21.010
Oh!... Oh!

14:21.560 --> 14:24.270
- Something wrong?
- My head!

14:24.320 --> 14:28.680
Ah! I'm going to be... Oh!
Think I'm going to be... sick!

14:38.840 --> 14:42.550
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Ambulance, please!

14:42.600 --> 14:45.240
- Is it the baby?
- Suspected post-natal eclampsia.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.440
Marjory, show me your
fingers. Are they swollen?

14:54.040 --> 14:55.760
And the other one?

14:57.040 --> 15:01.830
- Marjory?
- I can't... can't... won't move.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.830
What's wrong with her?
Why's she talking funny?!

15:04.880 --> 15:06.600
Can you look at me and try to smile?

15:07.920 --> 15:10.190
What are you doing?!

15:10.240 --> 15:12.040
Ambulance on its way.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.470
There's no oedema. Blood
pressure has dropped.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.120
Her speech is slurred and she
appears to have a left haemiplegia.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.510
I'm not so sure about eclampsia.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.400
I think she's had a stroke.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.350
There's room for one in the van.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.510
Can you look after the children for me?

15:53.280 --> 15:55.670
Mummy.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.480
No daffodils?!

16:07.200 --> 16:09.230
The harsh winter has taken its toll.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.840
Why is everything so faded?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.560
Hmmm?

16:26.600 --> 16:30.190
- What's happened? Where is she?
- You can't see her.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.510
They're getting her comfortable.

16:32.560 --> 16:36.310
Oh, Marjory!

16:36.360 --> 16:41.150
- She was fine this morning!
- She's had a stroke. - What?!

16:41.200 --> 16:43.910
- No, that's something old people get.
- You a doctor, are you?

16:43.960 --> 16:46.750
No, but I want to speak to someone!
I want to find out what's what!

16:46.800 --> 16:50.310
She can't talk. She can't walk.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.470
Maybe won't ever again.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.160
Well, I want to speak to someone.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.720
They'll only speak to the next of kin.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.839
I've told them that's me.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.760
How'd this happen? Whose fault is it?

17:22.319 --> 17:23.630
Wow, look at that!

17:23.680 --> 17:26.480
That's your father's car!
Welcoming committee at the ready!

17:30.600 --> 17:33.750
- Oh, Timothy? Jam.
- I know, I'm saving it for later.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.600
You won't get into medical
school with cheek like that!

17:38.680 --> 17:40.510
Here we are.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.190
Magdalena, meet the family.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.190
- Hello.
- Oh!

17:45.240 --> 17:48.430
- Mrs Turner?
- Uh, Magdalena?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.990
- Magda.
- Whatever you prefer.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.230
Your home is very pleasing.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.260
- Thank you.
- And so is your husband.

17:56.310 --> 17:58.090
Oh... Ah!

17:58.640 --> 18:00.750
And these are the children...

18:00.800 --> 18:04.030
- Teddy, Angela and...
- Timothy.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.990
Hello.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.030
You must be exhausted after your journey.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.790
Let me show you to your room.
Patrick, can you bring the bags?

18:10.840 --> 18:14.680
- I'll take those! - Thank you,
Timothy. That is very sweet of you.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.280
This way.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.150
A house so full of gentlemen.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.590
Goodness!

18:22.640 --> 18:24.710
She's not at all what I expected.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.110
She's very...

18:27.160 --> 18:28.590
confident.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.510
Isn't she? I had the most
interesting conversation in the car.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.020
It's quite refreshing.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.510
Ta-da!

18:48.560 --> 18:51.950
- Oh, I, I thought, I thought we were going out.
- But I've cooked dinner.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.190
Don't worry, it's just the two of us.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.920
I got everyone out of the way.

18:58.240 --> 19:02.440
There are only three rules when
planning an intimate dinner party.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.110
The food should be cooked to perfection

19:06.160 --> 19:08.550
and presented with style,

19:08.600 --> 19:10.680
and the guests should be agreeable.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.800
I'd say two out of the three isn't bad.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.070
It's called a "grapefruit surprise".

19:20.120 --> 19:21.830
The surprise, in my case,

19:21.880 --> 19:24.920
being that sugar burns remarkably
quickly under the grill.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.030
It looks... delicious.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.550
And don't worry, my
love, we won't go hungry.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.520
We can always have bread and jam.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.320
I'll make it.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.590
Then after I graduated
I toured the continent,

19:45.640 --> 19:47.430
working as a mother's help.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.830
Brussels, Amsterdam, Madrid,
then back to Paris where

19:50.880 --> 19:53.870
I cared for a family of a
professor at the Sorbonne.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.590
We must seem very
unsophisticated by comparison.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.070
No, not at all.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.190
My father is a doctor. I like medical men.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.710
- More coffee?
- Oh, thank you.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.390
What a bonus. We didn't anticipate
you'd bring your own coffee pot,

20:06.440 --> 20:10.310
- did we, Shelagh?
- Everyone knows English coffee is very bad.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.120
Well, this certainly beats
the stuff I'm used to.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.830
We had no idea you'd be so well travelled.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.510
It's important, I think.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.870
- I plan to travel.
- Oh, where?

20:22.920 --> 20:24.360
Extensively.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.910
Well, Angela's bath is long overdue.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.230
- I'll go and get her ready.
- Oh, please, Mrs Turner,

20:32.280 --> 20:33.720
bath-time is my job now.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.320
I'll show her where we keep the towels.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.750
Oh, Patrick. What have I done?

20:41.800 --> 20:44.480
I don't know why we didn't
get an au pair years ago.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.750
I've never seen a stroke in a new mother,

20:51.800 --> 20:53.590
not in all my years.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.400
It was Lucille spotted it.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.550
- Not sure it would have
occurred to me. - Nor me.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.510
I'm not surprised.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.750
It's so very, very rare.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.150
If the stroke is as severe as they say,

21:05.200 --> 21:08.200
she may be left permanently incapacitated.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.960
Life really can change
in the blink of an eye.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.190
Oh, no, those, those are for my wife.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.560
She's only getting you a bloody vase!

21:30.960 --> 21:33.910
Now, before we move onto the
subject of caring for a newborn,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.430
we'll have our usual recap
on last week's topic

21:36.480 --> 21:38.870
which, as you'll remember,
was the birth itself,

21:38.920 --> 21:41.390
and specifically how to breathe.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.640
In and out's always worked
fine for me, Sister.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.990
Sorry, Sister. He's such a joker.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.630
But Sister? If you're going to be
telling my Alan about the birth,

21:50.680 --> 21:52.630
does that mean he can
come to the actual thing?

21:52.680 --> 21:54.830
Only I've heard men aren't
allowed in the hospital.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.510
You're quite right,

21:56.560 --> 21:59.460
but as we do home births, we
offer a little more flexibility.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.230
Do you think it's something that
you and Mr Romaine might consider?

22:03.280 --> 22:07.230
My Alan would love to see his
baby being born. Wouldn't you Alan?

22:07.780 --> 22:08.320
Ah!

22:12.160 --> 22:15.670
That showed them. Just cos their
husband's ain't worth tuppence.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.590
And now you get to be with
me when our baby's being born!

22:18.640 --> 22:20.630
Yeah, look, about that...

22:20.680 --> 22:22.710
er, you know it might be a bit tricky.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.960
It might clash with a match.

22:28.760 --> 22:32.070
Oh, come on. In all the time you've
known me, have I ever missed a game?

22:32.120 --> 22:34.960
And in all the time you've known
me, have I ever had a baby?

22:36.760 --> 22:38.840
I'm just saying, you know I'd rather not.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.350
I don't think it's something I'd enjoy.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.360
Enjoy? What's enjoy got to do with it?!

22:46.480 --> 22:49.950
Do you really think I enjoy going to
your stupid football every Saturday,

22:50.000 --> 22:53.200
freezing on the touchline,
chopping up the half-time oranges?

23:04.480 --> 23:07.590
- Morning!
- Magda! Goodness, you're up early!

23:07.640 --> 23:10.350
Yes, today I make spicy eggs
for Timothy and Mr Turner.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.430
Really, there's no need.
Porridge will suffice.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.270
Everyone likes to try something new.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.430
You might want to put on a cardigan.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.240
You're not on the Continent now.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.870
Nothing unexpected to report
this morning, except that

23:27.920 --> 23:30.270
Marjory Chivvers is to
be discharged today.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.030
Gosh! That seems very soon.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.670
There's little more the
hospital can do for her.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.670
Her mother insisted she be
at home with her family.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.750
Nurse Anderson will continue
twice-daily visits for as long as

23:42.800 --> 23:47.230
is required. Her family will need
significant support to manage

23:47.280 --> 23:51.710
- Marjory's care, as she's
largely immobile. - Of course.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.150
Sister Winifred. How
was last night's class?

23:55.200 --> 23:58.510
It was marvellous! Thank you, Sister!

23:58.560 --> 24:00.080
The most tremendous success!

24:15.320 --> 24:17.000
Who's going to look after her?

24:24.640 --> 24:26.990
Everything is as it should be.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.710
There we are, nice and comfy.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.030
The hospital looked after Marjory well.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.030
They didn't fix her, though.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.630
I'm afraid there's little
we can do for strokes.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.950
There are medical advances being
made every day, but for now...

24:40.000 --> 24:44.070
- This is it? - The, main thing
is to keep Marjory comfortable

24:44.120 --> 24:46.270
while she recuperates.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.630
Keep her clean and changed,
and look out for bedsores.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.310
- I don't know how to do any of that.
- I can show you.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.270
That won't be necessary. I'll be doing it.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.790
I understand that you want
to do everything possible

24:57.840 --> 25:02.360
for your daughter, Mrs Stanton, but
it's not easy caring for an invalid.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.110
I'd advise you to accept
help where it's offered.

25:07.160 --> 25:08.760
If that's everything....

25:10.760 --> 25:15.470
A nurse will call tomorrow to do
the usual mother and baby checks.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.200
Thank you, doctor... nurse.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.270
- Do you want to hold him, love?
- She can't.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.270
I could put him on the bed next to her.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.430
What, so she can topple on
him? Take him downstairs.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.190
Alison'll look after
him while she's working.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.670
Take these an' all.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.430
I'll be staying in here from now on,

25:43.480 --> 25:45.200
in case she needs me in the night.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.070
You're all right, Marj,

26:31.120 --> 26:32.400
Mum's here.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.880
Back to the cubicle.

26:46.160 --> 26:50.190
Have you altered your
diet at all, Mrs Romaine?

26:50.240 --> 26:52.000
Only you've dropped a pound.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.790
Hmm?

26:56.840 --> 26:58.680
I've not had much appetite.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.680
Me and my husband have had
a bit of a falling-out.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.350
He's not the man I thought he was.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.390
I won't be long.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.550
Just down the clinic to get milk tokens.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.000
Come here, darling. There you go.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.110
You know you can't have
him on your own, darling.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.190
Come on, give him to me. There you go.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.630
There you go. There you go.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.070
You can't have any of them.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.520
Come on, girls. Let's
give Mummy some peace.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.430
Bye, love. See you next week.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.150
Course, you know what they say.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.710
Well, I imagine you're going to tell me.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.150
Well, Mae had that girl working like a dog

27:48.200 --> 27:50.550
right up until the baby came. All hours!

27:50.600 --> 27:52.390
And that's what did for her.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.190
That's what caused the stroke?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.270
Well, it's the only thing
that makes any sense.

27:56.320 --> 27:59.120
Have you ever heard of a stroke
in a young girl like that?

28:02.880 --> 28:05.430
- All right there, Mae?
- Violet.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.270
Come on, girls, come on.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.590
How's she doing?

28:09.640 --> 28:11.400
Come on, kids.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.950
We're one of them couples
that does everything together.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.800
"Soppy", my mum calls it.

28:22.400 --> 28:26.550
But now he doesn't want to be with me
at the most important moment of my life.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.840
Mrs Romaine, not every husband
has the stomach for childbirth.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.630
A man's job isn't to guide his
child through the birth canal,

28:35.680 --> 28:37.630
but through life itself.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.950
I never thought about it like that.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.840
Well, wipe those tears and
we'll get this all sorted out.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.360
But not before you've
had another Garibaldi.

28:54.600 --> 28:58.840
- Mae Stanton. Milk tokens.
- Of course. Let me see.

28:59.920 --> 29:03.270
Hello, Mrs Stanton. How nice to see you.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.680
- There you go. - Thank
you. - Hello, girls.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.800
- And how's little Denny?
- Hands off!

29:11.040 --> 29:12.680
Mrs Stanton!

29:16.200 --> 29:18.430
Come on, girls.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.590
- Come with me.
- You've already done for my daughter.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.750
You're not going near my grandson.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.510
What's going on?

29:25.560 --> 29:27.630
There was nothing wrong with my Marjory

29:27.680 --> 29:30.510
- until she got her filthy hands on her!
- That's enough!

29:30.560 --> 29:32.550
Oh, I haven't even started yet!

29:32.600 --> 29:35.350
I want everyone to hear
what I've got to say!

29:35.400 --> 29:38.630
What happened to my daughter
was nothing to do with me

29:38.680 --> 29:40.310
working her in the salon,

29:40.360 --> 29:43.310
but everything to do with her not
having a proper English midwife!

29:43.360 --> 29:45.790
Mae, stop! You're not being fair.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.050
Not fair? Not fair?!

29:48.800 --> 29:51.230
My daughter should be up
and about, feeding her baby,

29:51.280 --> 29:54.350
changing his nappies.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.520
Instead, I'm changing hers!

29:59.120 --> 30:02.350
If this is the National Health
Service, then you can stick it!

30:02.400 --> 30:05.190
I don't want you lot
anywhere near my family.

30:05.240 --> 30:06.760
And especially not her.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.920
Come on, girls.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.680
Nurse Crane?

30:38.280 --> 30:42.270
Why has Marjory Chivvers been
put on Nurse Dyer's care?

30:42.320 --> 30:44.830
I've been the one most involved with her!

30:44.880 --> 30:48.470
And you have provided exemplary care,

30:48.520 --> 30:54.360
but Sister Julienne and I decided to spare
you any more unpleasantness from that quarter.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.830
I see.

30:58.880 --> 31:00.360
If you will excuse me.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.270
With respect, Sister Julienne...

31:06.320 --> 31:10.230
I am always wary of the phrase
"with respect," Nurse Anderson,

31:10.280 --> 31:14.190
I generally find it is a
forerunner to candour,

31:14.240 --> 31:16.950
or possibly impertinence.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.230
I hope I would not be
impertinent to my superiors,

31:21.280 --> 31:25.750
but I must be frank, it's not
up to you, or to Nurse Crane,

31:25.800 --> 31:28.710
to decide how much
unpleasantness I can bare.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.870
But if you stop sending me to Marjory,

31:30.920 --> 31:34.120
it will look as though Mrs
Stanton's slurs are justified.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.440
And as though you accept
her attitude towards me.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.230
Nurse Anderson,

31:42.280 --> 31:44.510
I do not accept it.

31:44.560 --> 31:48.430
Then, with respect, Sister Julienne,

31:48.480 --> 31:50.200
you know what you should do.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.510
I feel terribly foolish.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.360
You just got carried away.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.750
It's easy to overburden a man.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.430
They think they must give
the impression of being more

32:03.480 --> 32:05.430
substantial than they actually are.

32:05.480 --> 32:08.110
I'll visit Mr Romaine after
he finishes work this evening.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.510
See if I can get to the bottom of things.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.190
Might I take your car?

32:12.240 --> 32:13.720
No.

32:20.760 --> 32:24.190
Right, love, I've got two minutes
before Mrs Finney's rinse

32:24.240 --> 32:26.190
needs to come off. Let's get you shifted.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.670
Don't want you getting bed sores.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.870
There you go, that's better.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.430
I'll see you at tea time.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.230
Have a good rest. You'll
soon be on the mend.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.240
M-mend...

32:46.400 --> 32:52.670
What confuses me, Mr Romaine, is that you
were perfectly prepared to come to the class.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.110
So I can see that you're
keen to support your wife.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.350
Yeah, I am, Sister.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.950
I'd do anything for her.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.590
Except...

33:00.640 --> 33:02.560
.. be by her side at the birth.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.790
I'm the oldest of six.

33:07.840 --> 33:10.110
Me mum had them all at home.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.750
It's very thin walls in the house.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.550
I can still hear the screaming.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.160
It's all right, Mr Romaine...

33:17.960 --> 33:19.440
.. I do understand.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.150
The fears we have in the present

33:24.200 --> 33:26.910
often lie in the experiences of the past.

33:26.960 --> 33:31.390
Now, why don't you go home and tell
your wife what you just told me?

33:31.440 --> 33:33.040
I think she'll understand too.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.670
Morning.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.920
Good morning.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.150
We missed you last night. We
had the Scrabble board out,

33:52.200 --> 33:55.200
we could've done with
someone who can spell!

33:56.240 --> 33:57.680
I had a headache.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.320
Lucille...

34:03.360 --> 34:06.960
.. what Mae Stanton said was unforgivable.

34:08.719 --> 34:10.719
Why would you apologise?

34:11.679 --> 34:17.630
Because I'm from the East
End, and I'm embarrassed

34:17.679 --> 34:21.000
and ashamed to think that one of
mine would treat you in that way.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.600
Listen...

34:26.440 --> 34:29.350
.. I've been made a
scapegoat before today.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.800
I've been picked on,
and I've been bullied.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.949
When?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.400
When I was in the Army.

34:39.520 --> 34:43.070
There weren't many nurses
from my sort of background,

34:43.120 --> 34:47.350
and there was one Sister who thought
there shouldn't be any at all.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.590
Everything I did was wrong,

34:49.639 --> 34:53.679
every tiny mistake was
punished and put on file.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.510
I kept holding out, holding on,

34:58.560 --> 35:01.160
not letting her get the better of me.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.870
A soldier was brought in wounded,

35:04.920 --> 35:08.910
after an accident during
a live firing exercise.

35:08.960 --> 35:12.350
He was crying for his mum, he was only 18,

35:12.400 --> 35:16.520
and I squeezed his hand and I said,
"I'll be your mum till morning."

35:19.480 --> 35:21.120
Never saw morning.

35:25.280 --> 35:29.280
And that Sister spoke
against me at the inquiry.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.710
I wasn't to blame,

35:32.760 --> 35:34.240
the inquiry said that...

35:35.600 --> 35:38.390
.. but I'd had enough.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.240
I bought myself out my post, came home.

35:44.080 --> 35:46.950
You shouldn't have felt
you had to do that,

35:47.000 --> 35:48.960
you are an excellent nurse.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.280
I could say the same to you.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.350
I've had patients who
won't let me touch them

35:59.400 --> 36:02.920
because they think the black
will rub off on their skin.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.440
I'm sorry.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.240
I know that's not enough.

36:38.960 --> 36:44.270
Mrs Stanton, I understand that you
are looking for someone to blame,

36:44.320 --> 36:47.150
but what happened to
Marjory was not my fault,

36:47.200 --> 36:48.550
and it was not your fault either.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.200
I never said it was!

36:51.640 --> 36:53.040
I heard some gossip...

36:54.120 --> 36:56.430
.. people saying that
Marjory became unwell

36:56.480 --> 37:01.230
because she was on her feet, working
in here for her whole nine months.

37:01.280 --> 37:04.750
To think those silly gossiping
women believe they know better

37:04.800 --> 37:07.920
than all the highly-trained
doctors at the hospital.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.640
Only the good Lord himself
knows why she had that stroke.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.870
I brought a prescription for Marjory.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.520
May I take it upstairs?

37:28.480 --> 37:29.720
Yeah.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.910
Once you're washed, Marjory, we'll
brush your teeth and do your hair.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.630
Who does yours?

37:43.680 --> 37:44.920
Hair.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.110
I go to a woman who runs
a salon from her kitchen.

37:49.160 --> 37:50.910
That don't sound very professional.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.150
I like it.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.270
Reminds me of back home.

37:55.320 --> 37:59.190
When I was a child my mother used to
plait my hair at the kitchen table.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.990
She made them so tight.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.150
I can still remember the pain!

38:03.200 --> 38:04.910
Do you miss her?

38:04.960 --> 38:06.200
Your mum?

38:09.120 --> 38:10.480
Of course.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.670
But she writes with all the news.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.200
I'll get the powder, shall I?

38:20.240 --> 38:22.350
You're a good boy today, Teddy!

38:22.400 --> 38:24.230
Hello!

38:24.280 --> 38:26.790
- You're home early.
- I haven't got many classes now.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.390
It's mainly private study.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.550
After all, I'm practically at University.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.710
Ah. Well, in that case you
can help me peel the potatoes.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.310
Shall we put on the radio?

38:35.360 --> 38:37.470
Absolutely.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.150
It's a shame it's a bit
early for Radio Luxembourg.

38:40.200 --> 38:44.120
It's a bit more groovy
than the boring old BBC.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.030
♪ Tomorrow

38:48.080 --> 38:51.230

39:36.040 --> 39:38.390
Have a rest, Mrs Stanton.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.590
I'll take over here.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.800
Thank you.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.790
Come on, then.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.800
Let's have another go at these teeth, eh?

39:58.440 --> 40:00.520
On... the...

40:02.120 --> 40:03.760
.. mend.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.270
So you keep saying, darling.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.000
So you keep saying.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.510
Goodbye, Mr Chivvers.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.230
Yeah.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.470
See you tomorrow.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.790
Sounds like baby needs something.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.670
Maybe a cuddle with Mum?

40:33.720 --> 40:36.110
It'll only end in upset.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.070
Mae'll be out in a minute.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.750
She'll deal with it.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.510
You could see to him?

40:41.560 --> 40:44.280
What, and get my head bitten
off for not doing it right?

40:52.160 --> 40:53.670
Come on, baby.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.200
Oh, there-there.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.990
You know, Marjory, she's...

41:01.040 --> 41:02.600
.. she's started to speak.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.670
Same three words over and over again,

41:07.720 --> 41:09.790
but it's a start, innit?

41:09.840 --> 41:11.040
Absolutely.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.520
I miss her, Nurse.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.110
I really do.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.470
She's still there, Mr Chivvers.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.350
You just have to look a
little harder to find her.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.950
It's supposed to be a man's
job looking after the family.

41:27.000 --> 41:32.710
Only I never had to do that cos Marj,

41:32.760 --> 41:34.560
she kept things running lovely.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.550
Now...

41:40.600 --> 41:43.040
.. the way she is...

41:47.120 --> 41:48.840
I can't make things right.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.200
Not for her...

41:53.200 --> 41:55.350
.. not for any of us.

41:55.400 --> 41:58.230
Nanna Mae's here.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.560
Give him to me.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.590
I'm, erm, I'm off down the pub.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.640
No surprise there, then!

42:12.360 --> 42:15.110
Enter.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.950
Ah, Nurse Anderson.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.230
Nurse Crane said you
wished to see me, Doctor.

42:19.280 --> 42:22.000
Yes, it's about Marjory Chivvers.

42:23.320 --> 42:27.710
I've managed to find her a place
at an occupational therapy clinic.

42:27.760 --> 42:31.350
I think she should be
encouraged to accept it.

42:31.400 --> 42:34.310
They usually treat geriatric patients,

42:34.360 --> 42:38.750
but I've made them aware that
Marjory has a new baby to care for.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.550
She'll need to work on different skills.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.030
I think that might really help her.

42:44.080 --> 42:47.230
Marjorie needs to believe
that she has a future,

42:47.280 --> 42:50.430
and so do the people who love her most,

42:50.480 --> 42:54.510
meanwhile, we must never say

42:54.560 --> 42:56.510
that there's nothing we can do.

42:56.560 --> 42:58.040
All right?

42:59.960 --> 43:01.710
You're back late.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.870
I'll get your supper.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.950
Magda did a coq au vin.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.590
Ooh, delicious!

43:07.640 --> 43:09.710
If you like that kind of thing.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.430
Do I detect a tone?

43:11.480 --> 43:12.710
Oh, no.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.070
But I can see why it
wouldn't suit everyone.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.430
Coq au vin?

43:16.480 --> 43:18.430
Having an au pair!

43:18.480 --> 43:23.910
There are challenges in having
a young woman around the house,

43:23.960 --> 43:26.310
one who wanders around half dressed.

43:26.360 --> 43:28.310
Heads could be turned.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.510
Shelagh, I assure you, I've never
looked at Magda in that way.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.430
Not you! Timothy!

43:33.480 --> 43:36.350
Oh, I see.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.550
Though now you mention it!

43:38.600 --> 43:40.760
I only have eyes for you.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.710
Although perhaps you're right
to be concerned about Timothy.

43:45.760 --> 43:49.560
On the bright side, she has
got him doing the dishes.

44:02.320 --> 44:05.630
So what can they do for Marjory here?

44:05.680 --> 44:09.630
The idea is that she'll come
here weekly to regain strength

44:09.680 --> 44:13.240
and learn new approaches
to everyday tasks.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.990
This place could give her
some hope for the future.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.520
I've seen enough.

44:21.160 --> 44:23.510
- There's more, Mae.
- No, there ain't.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.070
I'm not having her dragged down stairs

44:26.120 --> 44:28.670
and across town to sit with a bunch of...

44:28.720 --> 44:31.230
If this is your hope, Dr Turner,

44:31.280 --> 44:33.720
I'd hate to see your despair.

44:41.720 --> 44:46.070
Mrs Stanton glimpsed the future

44:46.120 --> 44:48.990
and she did not like what she saw.

44:49.040 --> 44:50.710
So nothing changes.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.830
Marjory is trapped
inside those four walls.

44:53.880 --> 44:57.480
Unable to walk, or speak,
or care for her children.

44:59.080 --> 45:02.230
What cannot be changed must be endured.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.710
Do you believe that?

45:03.760 --> 45:07.030
When I was a girl? No.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.200
But with experience, and age...

45:13.040 --> 45:15.080
.. hope dims.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.400
Do you mind if I sit a little while?

45:26.160 --> 45:28.550
I could read to you?

45:28.600 --> 45:31.720
If you are lonely, I can keep you company.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.790
Right, dig deep. No slacking,

45:45.840 --> 45:47.830
and you work on your skills.

45:47.880 --> 45:50.480
Right, lads, get out there
and give it some welly!

45:55.520 --> 45:57.000
Ooh...

45:59.400 --> 46:00.910
You cut your finger again, love?

46:00.960 --> 46:03.790
No, it's just these practise contractions.

46:03.840 --> 46:05.830
Ooh...

46:05.880 --> 46:09.470
That don't look like a practice one to me.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.870
Ah! Allan, will you please
come here and help me?

46:11.920 --> 46:14.150
I'll get her to the maternity
home and be back here,

46:14.200 --> 46:16.630
- as soon as possible.
- Oh, Allan, come on!

46:16.680 --> 46:19.190
Allan! Allan!

46:19.240 --> 46:21.510
Practice your keepie-uppies
in the meantime.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.430
Get back here now.

46:23.480 --> 46:24.910
Oi! It's not funny!

46:24.960 --> 46:27.240
Allan! Allan!

46:30.480 --> 46:31.840
Mr Chivvers.

46:33.560 --> 46:36.550
You want to make things
right for your family?

46:36.600 --> 46:37.840
Yeah, I do.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.430
This is your chance,

46:41.480 --> 46:44.880
your chance to build a
proper future for your wife.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.310
Hold tight, Jan!

46:52.360 --> 46:54.150
Go easy on the corners, Allan.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.880
It's all right. Nearly there.

47:01.520 --> 47:02.880
How's Marjory?

47:03.920 --> 47:06.110
She's on the mend.

47:06.160 --> 47:08.350
I'd love to pop up and keep her company.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.720
Another time, eh? She's having a nap.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.910
All right, Mrs Buckle?

47:20.960 --> 47:22.390
Oh, all right, Dennis?

47:22.440 --> 47:24.830
- I'll have my son, thanks.
- Course.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.760
Yeah, we've got things to do.

47:29.720 --> 47:32.600
Come on girls! Let's go see your mummy.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.000
Come along, Karen.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.270
What you doing?

47:42.320 --> 47:44.230
She can't go out in her nightie.

47:44.280 --> 47:45.840
She needs to look nice.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.390
Going out? Going where?

47:50.440 --> 47:52.230
To them classes...

47:52.280 --> 47:53.950
.. at the hospital.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.790
I called Dr Turner,

47:55.840 --> 47:57.590
she starts on Monday.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.190
Blue cardie all right, love?

47:59.240 --> 48:00.710
She's going nowhere.

48:00.760 --> 48:03.350
Do you think she wants
people seeing her like that?

48:03.400 --> 48:06.510
I think she wants out this room
and to have some kind of life!

48:06.560 --> 48:09.630
Look, I'm grateful for
everything you've done,

48:09.680 --> 48:11.080
Mae, I really am...

48:15.360 --> 48:16.710
.. but I'm the man of the house.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.870
- Don't make me laugh!
- I mean it!

48:18.920 --> 48:20.190
Sorry.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.870
Actually, no, I'm not,

48:21.920 --> 48:23.680
cos this is how it's going to be now.

48:24.960 --> 48:28.150
Me, Marj,

48:28.200 --> 48:30.630
the kids, and you,

48:30.680 --> 48:32.560
all working to get through this.

48:33.840 --> 48:35.870
And we will.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.640
We will get through it.

48:39.040 --> 48:44.230
And if she needs someone in the night,

48:44.280 --> 48:45.840
then I'll be here...

48:47.240 --> 48:48.920
.. cos I'm her husband.

49:00.440 --> 49:01.790
It's not far to go now.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.310
You can hang on.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.590
I can't! I can feel something down there.

49:05.640 --> 49:08.150
I think it's the head!

49:08.200 --> 49:10.150
Allan!

49:10.200 --> 49:12.150
Hold on, love. I'm calling for help.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.720
Get back here! Allan!

49:17.280 --> 49:19.110
Don't panic, Mr Romaine.

49:19.160 --> 49:20.670
A midwife is on their way.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.190
Should I let her push or...?

49:22.240 --> 49:24.790
No, it's very important
that she doesn't push yet.

49:24.840 --> 49:26.870
Perhaps you could encourage her to pant.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.430
To pant? Pant, pant,
pant, yeah, thank you.

49:29.480 --> 49:30.870
Mrs Romaine has gone into labour.

49:30.920 --> 49:33.510
She's in the team's football
bus, which is down by the river.

49:33.560 --> 49:35.870
If you take your bike you
should be there in no time.

49:35.920 --> 49:36.960
Mr Romaine?

50:02.040 --> 50:05.590
- Oh, thank goodness, Allan!
- Yeah, I'm here, I'm here. - Allan!

50:05.640 --> 50:08.270
Midwife said she'll be here
in a minute, all right?

50:10.280 --> 50:11.720
Uh, come on.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.350
Help me off with my knickers!

50:15.400 --> 50:18.350
I can't do that! I can't go down that end!

50:18.400 --> 50:20.310
It's never bothered you before.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.630
That's how we got here in the first place!

50:22.680 --> 50:24.910
Come on! Allan!

50:24.960 --> 50:26.470
Allan! Get back in here.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.750
Allan!

50:27.800 --> 50:29.600
You all right, darling?

50:30.920 --> 50:32.320
Oh, what?

50:36.080 --> 50:38.550
Please, if I could just get
through? I'm a midwife on call.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.230
Sorry, Sister, no can do.

50:40.280 --> 50:42.230
The brakes have seized,
we can't shift her.

50:42.280 --> 50:43.800
Oh, dear.

50:49.640 --> 50:51.110
Can you see anything?

50:51.160 --> 50:52.630
I ain't looking!

50:52.680 --> 50:55.430
You have to! You can't catch
a baby with your eyes shut!

50:55.480 --> 50:57.110
Hurry!

50:57.160 --> 50:59.590
Oh, my days.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.480
Another one coming!

51:03.480 --> 51:05.230
All right, Jan.

51:05.280 --> 51:06.760
You give it some welly!

51:09.280 --> 51:10.670
Good girl.

51:10.720 --> 51:13.110
That's it, it's coming!

51:13.160 --> 51:14.720
Here now.

51:16.720 --> 51:19.070
Goodness, Mr Romaine, you are doing well.

51:19.120 --> 51:21.670
Erm, do you have something
we can wrap baby in?

51:21.720 --> 51:23.830
Yeah, clean strips, bag on the front seat.

51:23.880 --> 51:25.470
Perhaps you could?

51:25.520 --> 51:27.480
Ah, yeah.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.520
Hello!

51:45.760 --> 51:47.910
Thank goodness you're here, Sister.

51:47.960 --> 51:50.390
- He won't stop barking orders.
- I can imagine.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.270
But between the two of you, you
have done rather a marvellous job.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.830
Just a few more pushes
and baby will be born.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.510
You hear that, Jan?

51:57.560 --> 51:59.310
Next one that comes, you give it some...

51:59.360 --> 52:00.830
Thank you, Mr Romaine.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.560
I think Janet knows
exactly what to do. Ready?

52:21.800 --> 52:24.550
Well, well, well.

52:24.600 --> 52:26.680
Well done, Mrs Romaine. Pant, pant, pant.

52:33.600 --> 52:38.360
The head's out. When
you're ready, another push.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.880
You have a little girl!

53:01.480 --> 53:03.470
Well done, both of you.

53:03.520 --> 53:06.560
Do you want your mummy? There we go.

53:11.240 --> 53:13.480
There we go.

53:17.720 --> 53:20.520
Would you like to cut
the cord, Mr Romaine?

53:22.280 --> 53:24.840
Head between your knees, and deep breaths.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.190
I'll have one of these, please.

53:37.240 --> 53:39.230
Mrs Edwards!

53:39.280 --> 53:41.270
Nurse Dyer, how are you?

53:41.320 --> 53:44.950
It was stolen while I was out
taking my daily constitutional.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.070
It's a Morris Minor four-door saloon...

53:48.120 --> 53:50.990
That was found abandoned at
the entrance to the southbound

53:51.040 --> 53:53.390
tunnel just up from the Black Sail.

53:53.440 --> 53:56.070
Oh, thank goodness!

53:56.120 --> 53:59.310
Well, I'm afraid I don't
share your elation.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.590
It was impeding the flow of traffic.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.950
Well, that's hardly my fault.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.670
Do you have any clues of
the identity of the thief?

54:07.720 --> 54:11.920
Well, whoever it was, they
left the keys in the car.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.870
That was amazing.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.440
You were amazing.

54:27.040 --> 54:30.640
Next baby, I promise I'm going to be
right by your side the whole time.

54:32.040 --> 54:34.200
No, you're bloody not.

54:44.520 --> 54:46.400
You look lovely.

54:48.520 --> 54:50.960
So I brought you something.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.840
They're nothing fancy.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.520
Wed-ding.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.230
Yeah.

55:10.280 --> 55:12.040
Wedding.

55:26.160 --> 55:28.800
- Oh, hello.
- Hello, indeed.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
All right, my girls?

55:46.920 --> 55:52.390
Marjory Chivvers faced her future
with her family by her side.

55:52.440 --> 55:56.190
Her quest was not for
novelty, but wholeness.

55:56.240 --> 56:01.080
Not for change, for restoration
of the things she'd lost.

56:02.160 --> 56:07.550
Together, she and Dennis found
new ways to care for each other

56:07.600 --> 56:09.430
and their children

56:09.480 --> 56:12.190
and discovered reserves of strength

56:12.240 --> 56:14.520
that they never knew they had.

56:18.760 --> 56:22.990
The longest paths lead into sunlight

56:23.040 --> 56:25.840
when they are paved with love.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.520
Hello.

56:39.960 --> 56:42.590
We only asked Mrs Edwards
for a couple of recipes

56:42.640 --> 56:44.950
so we could cook something
to make you feel at home,

56:45.000 --> 56:47.590
but she rather exceeded expectations.

56:47.640 --> 56:50.150
Ta dah!

56:50.200 --> 56:52.190
I don't know what to say!

56:52.240 --> 56:55.830
How about a quick Grace,
and then we can all tuck in?

56:55.880 --> 56:58.150
These little dumplings look scrumptious.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.430
What have I told you
about helping yourself?

57:00.480 --> 57:03.990
I don't know how many more times I
can apologise for borrowing your car.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.320
I'll let you know when you're done.

57:08.360 --> 57:09.960
Now...

57:12.720 --> 57:15.670
Everything is just a bit too
much for your wife at the moment.

57:15.720 --> 57:18.190
- She's going nowhere.
- Fit for a queen.

57:18.240 --> 57:20.150
We've just got to find entrants!

57:20.200 --> 57:21.750
I will enter.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.830
She loves you almost
as much as I do, Trixie.

57:23.880 --> 57:25.990
Oh, dear!

57:26.040 --> 57:27.710
These young girls are

57:27.760 --> 57:29.630
offerings to the fertility gods.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.600
There's no treatment for it.
