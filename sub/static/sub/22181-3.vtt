00:00.968 --> 00:01.769
[theme music playing]

00:01.802 --> 00:02.336
[Kara]
My name's Kara Zor-El.

00:02.370 --> 00:03.737
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.272 --> 00:05.773
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.742
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.744
But my pod got
knocked off course,

00:10.778 --> 00:12.046
and by the time I got here,

00:12.080 --> 00:16.317
my cousin had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.820
I hid who I really was
until one day,

00:19.853 --> 00:23.291
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.424 --> 00:26.727
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.397
But in secret, I work
with my adopted sister

00:29.430 --> 00:32.400
for the DEO to protect my city
from alien life

00:32.433 --> 00:34.602
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.439
I am Supergirl!

00:39.773 --> 00:41.542
[narrator]
Previously on Supergirl...

00:41.575 --> 00:42.810
You do wanna have kids, right?

00:43.311 --> 00:44.845
I've never seen myself
being a mom.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.447
Is that okay?

00:46.480 --> 00:47.481
No. Of course.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.283
I'm going back to Mars.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.751
There must be
other White Martians

00:50.784 --> 00:53.421
who don't wanna be defined
by the hatred of our kind.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.356
Good bye, Ms. Martian.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.691
J'onn you must
come to Mars. Now.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.028
Well, the loft looks great.

01:01.629 --> 01:04.465
Now if we could just burn this,
then it would be perfect.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.666
No, come on, it's adorable.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.836
I don't know why
I thought throwing
a lesbian wedding shower

01:08.869 --> 01:11.472
would curb Mom's cheesy antics.

01:11.505 --> 01:15.709
Nope, gay, straight, whatever,
Eliza will not be stopped,

01:15.909 --> 01:18.746
until she digs up
every bridal shower game

01:18.779 --> 01:20.714
since the beginning of time.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.817
You know what?
You're gonna love bridal bingo.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.554
Kill me now, please.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.423
How are you doing?

01:30.491 --> 01:31.492
Fine. Great.

01:34.162 --> 01:34.862
Alex.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.131
What's going on with me
has nothing to do

01:37.165 --> 01:38.399
with you and Maggie.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.701
I could not be happier for you.

01:41.635 --> 01:44.104
I know. It means a lot.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.639
[knocking at door]

01:45.839 --> 01:47.508
Oh! Eliza's early.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.509
Okay.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.478
Hi! Oh, J'onn.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.513
Come on in. Is everything okay?

01:52.780 --> 01:55.516
Yeah, yeah. Everything's great.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.651
I just...

01:59.653 --> 02:01.722
I just needed
to talk to you both.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.658
I have to go away
for a few days.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.861
I'm gonna need you both
to manage the DEO
until I get back.

02:08.396 --> 02:09.397
Where are you going?

02:10.464 --> 02:11.465
Mars.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.133
Mars?

02:14.067 --> 02:15.669
M'gann sent me a message.
She needs my help.

02:15.703 --> 02:16.704
Help with what?

02:22.543 --> 02:25.413
Message was short, urgent.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.782
I tried to make contact,
but I couldn't reach her.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.951
But I can sense
that she's in danger.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.754
No, J'onn ,you're
the last Green Martian.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.923
The Whites have been
trying to kill your kind
for centuries.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.825
Going back would be
a suicide mission.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.561
Look, M'gann came to our aid
when we were in need.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.463
I must go for M'gann.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.932
If you are going to Mars,
then Kara is going with you.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.267
Yeah.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.769
I won't have you
endanger your life
just to fight my battles.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.704
Your battles
are my battles, J'onn.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.607
I can't take you away
from Alex's shower.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.508
[Alex] Are you kidding?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.544
If I thought
that I could survive Mars,

02:56.577 --> 02:58.479
then I'd be right there
fighting by your side.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.550
J'onn, if Krypton still existed
and I had to go back

03:02.583 --> 03:04.752
to where my parents
were buried, under rubble,

03:04.785 --> 03:06.720
I know you wouldn't
let me do it alone.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.460
[dramatic music playing]

03:17.465 --> 03:20.868
Shouldn't we just call Winn
to fire up the transmat portal?

03:21.469 --> 03:23.604
No, you can't transmat
planet to planet

03:23.637 --> 03:25.473
without a gate
on the other side.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.509
We'll have to get to Mars
the old fashioned way.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.450
It's a cool car.

03:36.484 --> 03:40.454
So, is this like an elevator
to a secret hangar
that'll... take us--

03:40.488 --> 03:41.489
No, it isn't.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.292
This is your ship?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.462
Yup.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.831
-We're taking this to Mars?
-Yes we are.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.600
Okay.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.634
[static on radio]

03:56.069 --> 03:57.905
Careful with
the leather there, Supergirl.

03:58.972 --> 03:59.873
Sorry.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.811
There's no seat belt.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.045
It's from a different era.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.647
And a different planet.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.017
I come from a race
of shapeshifters, Kara.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.853
Why shouldn't our technology
shapeshift too?

04:14.087 --> 04:14.988
Fair enough.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.524
[engine revving]

04:16.557 --> 04:17.558
[rock music playing]

04:31.572 --> 04:32.640
[laughing]

04:33.774 --> 04:36.544
Eliza, the lasagna
is incredible.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.045
Alex and I order in so much,

04:38.078 --> 04:39.780
I forgot
what real food tastes like.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.350
Thank you.
It is the girls' favorite.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.585
I'm just disappointed
Kara couldn't be here.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.822
I know whatever she is doing
with J'onn is important, but...

04:49.590 --> 04:52.593
I just, I do worry about her.

04:52.793 --> 04:57.331
You know, it's been hard,
but she's working through it.

04:59.767 --> 05:03.837
Well, this weekend
is about happy matters
of the heart.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.107
And I did want
to make a bridal board
for you too, Maggie,

05:07.140 --> 05:10.978
but, Alex said you have
no childhood pictures.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.013
No.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.848
If you don't mind my asking...

05:15.015 --> 05:17.785
how long has it been since
you've talked to your parents?

05:18.118 --> 05:19.887
Um, since I was 14.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.826
You know what, Mom? Let's
just talk about something else.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.995
No, no, Alex, it's okay.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.063
Um...

05:30.998 --> 05:33.867
I told a girl at school
that I liked her

05:33.901 --> 05:35.335
and my parents found out.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.970
I came home that day,

05:37.971 --> 05:39.072
it was winter,

05:39.940 --> 05:43.010
and my dad was there
with a suitcase,

05:44.945 --> 05:46.780
and he told me
to get into the car.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.083
And...

05:51.885 --> 05:53.387
we drove in silence.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.956
And I just stared
out the window

05:56.156 --> 05:58.992
looking at the icicles
on the trees,

06:00.093 --> 06:03.664
and I was terrified
to say anything,

06:03.931 --> 06:05.666
but finally I said...

06:07.134 --> 06:08.769
I said, " Papi ,
what did I do?"

06:11.104 --> 06:14.442
And then he just looked at me
with such contempt...

06:16.209 --> 06:17.845
and said, um...

06:19.747 --> 06:20.948
"You shamed me."

06:22.850 --> 06:24.685
And then he pulled up
to my aunt's house,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.821
and left me with my suitcase.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.427
That was the last thing
that my father said to me.

06:34.962 --> 06:37.631
The only thing
shameful about that story

06:37.665 --> 06:39.800
is how your father
treated you, Maggie.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.937
Yeah, yeah.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.939
[motor whirring]

06:49.810 --> 06:50.878
[wind blowing]

06:50.911 --> 06:51.945
[swishing]

06:54.848 --> 06:55.949
[motor whirring]

06:58.786 --> 06:59.687
[suspenseful music playing]

07:15.168 --> 07:16.436
What now?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.740
I think we're here.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.716
M'gann.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.253
J'onn, you came.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.955
I wasn't sure that you would.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.991
I'd do anything
for you, M'gann.
You know that.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.831
Kara, you didn't have to--

07:43.864 --> 07:44.932
You came when we needed you.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.202
Till'all.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.104
[growling]

07:55.275 --> 07:57.244
If he's worried about the sight
of White Martians,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.913
he came to the wrong planet.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.048
[M'gann] Meet Till'all,

08:01.081 --> 08:03.851
one of our best fighters,
but his bedside manner

08:03.884 --> 08:05.052
could use some work.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.187
And N'keyy, a new recruit.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.990
It's an honor, J'onn J'onzz.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.258
M'gann's told us about you,

08:11.291 --> 08:13.126
how you inspired her
to rise up and--

08:13.160 --> 08:14.027
[Till'all] Enough.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.997
We've already wasted a day
trying to bring him here.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.833
Wasted? We came all this way
to fight alongside you.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.134
We didn't
bring you here to fight.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.036
Silence, Till'all.
That's an order.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.238
What's going on, M'gann?

08:26.540 --> 08:29.877
We recently
stormed a White Martian base
near the D'ori'i crater.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.913
There was a prison camp there
for Green Martians.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.147
There were dozens of camps.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.917
Well, this one
was still in operation.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.886
How is that possible?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.554
I'm the only
Green Martian left.

08:41.855 --> 08:42.856
No.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.025
There's another one.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.329
I brought you here
because I didn't think

08:49.362 --> 08:51.999
you'd believe me unless you
saw this for yourself.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.573
J'onn?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.575
Who is it?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.880
It's my father.

09:11.819 --> 09:12.820
It's him.

09:13.821 --> 09:14.822
He's alive.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.090
My wife, my daughters?

09:18.959 --> 09:22.996
So they kept him
and only him alive
for hundreds of years? Why?

09:23.030 --> 09:26.166
Myr'nn J'onzz
is the high religious leader
of the Green Martians.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.367
Not even the worst
of the Whites

09:27.400 --> 09:29.269
would kill the prime servant
of H'ronmeer.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.304
Instead they sentenced him
to a fate worse than death.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.808
Alone for centuries,
thinking he was the last
of his kind. Of his people!

09:34.842 --> 09:36.376
Soon they'll all be dead.
We're running out of time.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.711
What does he mean?

09:37.745 --> 09:40.848
We believe your father
knows how to find
the Staff of Kolar.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.182
-You can't be serious.
-Staff of what?

09:42.215 --> 09:44.351
-Kolar.
-It's a myth, it's a parable.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.319
My father used
to tell me stories about it.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.256
"Be a good boy or H'ronmeer
will strike you down."

09:49.289 --> 09:50.624
It isn't real.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.593
It is, and the White Martians
have found out
where it's buried.

09:53.861 --> 09:56.396
The staff of your god H'ronmeer
is a psychic weapon.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.632
Which means that if
the Whites find it

09:58.666 --> 10:01.635
they can track down
every resistance fighter
and kill us where we stand.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.836
We'd be helpless.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.105
We raided the base
hoping to find
the staff's location

10:05.138 --> 10:06.339
but they had already moved on.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.942
Your father
had been left behind.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.111
They didn't realize
how valuable he'd be to us.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.846
Valuable?
What are you talking about?

10:12.880 --> 10:14.948
We believe he knows
where the Whites
are planning to dig.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.216
[Kara]
Won't he tell you where it is?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.986
He has closed his mind to us,
completely. We can't read it.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.955
He is willing to let us die
and he calls himself
a man of God.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.259
That man of God was tortured
for centuries by your people.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.029
Then you understand
what is at stake.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.632
If we don't find
the staff first,
our resistance is finished,

10:32.900 --> 10:36.036
and then the monsters
who slaughtered your people

10:36.336 --> 10:38.138
get this planet,
once and for all.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.140
[M'gann] We need you to go
to your father, J'onn.

10:40.173 --> 10:44.044
Convince him to help us,
and then we can save Mars.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.212
Together.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.681
[music increases in tempo]

10:51.251 --> 10:55.288
You never told me
the whole story
about your dad and the car.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.557
What's the point?

10:57.590 --> 11:00.193
I wanna share everything
with you, Maggie.
I mean, the good and the bad.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.462
I knew that he
was hard on you--

11:02.495 --> 11:05.933
But before that day,
he was the best father.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.969
I know he sounds
like a monster, but...

11:10.037 --> 11:11.671
you just don't know
where he came from.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.708
Well, it sounds like you
still really love him.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.311
I don't know,
I am just saying that

11:19.079 --> 11:20.413
he didn't have it easy.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.085
Well, have you ever thought
about calling him?

11:25.252 --> 11:26.353
Of course I have.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.088
And?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.460
My aunt told me that my mother
removed every picture of me

11:33.493 --> 11:34.762
from the photo albums.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.463
They erased me,

11:37.230 --> 11:38.231
I don't need that.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.704
Look, what your family
did to you
was incredibly hurtful,

11:45.272 --> 11:48.976
but sometimes parents can do
really stupid things

11:49.009 --> 11:51.244
when they are up
against something
they don't understand.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.115
What if you invited
them to the shower?

11:56.984 --> 11:57.985
Are you kidding?

11:58.986 --> 12:01.021
Well, it's the perfect excuse
to reach out.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.122
Yeah, right.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.492
You kicked me out
because I'm gay, but, "Hey,
come to my gay shower."

12:05.525 --> 12:06.994
It was a long time ago.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.728
Maggie, the world has changed.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.430
Maybe they have too.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.133
I don't think so.
Babe, look, I love you.
Just please drop it.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.268
Okay.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.750
I'm praying. Leave me be.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.089
I think that this time...

12:37.157 --> 12:40.060
H'ronmeer will
allow you a moment
of personal indulgence.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.032
It's me, Father.

12:46.499 --> 12:47.534
It's J'onn.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.807
You're angry with me...

12:55.442 --> 12:56.776
for abandoning you...

12:58.045 --> 12:59.146
as you should be.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.318
I know how you must have felt,

13:06.519 --> 13:08.321
alone all these years,

13:09.189 --> 13:11.458
thinking you'd never
see another Green Martian,

13:12.425 --> 13:15.195
thinking our entire family
had been destroyed.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.482
You really thought such a trick
would work on me?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.185
Father.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.053
[exclaiming in annoyance]
I survived two centuries

13:40.087 --> 13:43.223
of imprisonment
and torture... alone.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.527
So, if you think exploiting
the form of my dead son

13:47.560 --> 13:50.163
will break me, you are a fool.

13:50.597 --> 13:54.334
I will never tell you
where the Staff of Kolar is.

13:55.368 --> 13:59.239
Father, it's me, J'onn.
I lived.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.508
I fled to Earth, I survived.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.244
[laughing]

14:04.912 --> 14:07.180
You give yourself away, White.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.517
My son would never have fled.

14:39.179 --> 14:39.913
[clicking]

14:45.953 --> 14:46.954
[speaking in Spanish]

14:56.729 --> 14:58.531
I'm living
in National City now.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.601
[in Spanish]

15:02.169 --> 15:03.236
I'm a cop.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.537
I like it, it's good.

15:05.538 --> 15:09.176
So, um, anyway,
I am calling because...

15:10.310 --> 15:11.311
I'm getting married.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.916
No, it's not a...

15:19.319 --> 15:20.620
Her name is Alex.

15:24.457 --> 15:29.362
Anyway, we are having a party.
A wedding shower, on Sunday
and, um...

15:30.730 --> 15:34.601
You probably can't make it,
but I thought
maybe I would invite you.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.975
See, I'd like it if you came.

15:42.009 --> 15:42.709
[switching to Spanish]

15:45.478 --> 15:47.214
Anyway, I hope
you and Mom are good.

15:48.215 --> 15:48.948
[switching to Spanish]

16:00.293 --> 16:01.494
Why did I do that?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.566
I don't understand why
he couldn't sense me.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.202
He couldn't see me.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.971
He's been in prison
a long time.
He's probably used to tricks.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.207
Enough of this. I'm going in.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.242
You will not.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.477
If the Green won't share
the information willingly,

16:17.510 --> 16:19.779
we'll have to invoke
the right of Tyagar
and take it by force.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.014
What's Tyagar?

16:22.215 --> 16:23.550
It will allow him
to force through
my father's mental block

16:24.351 --> 16:25.452
and show him
where the staff is.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.653
Could that hurt him?

16:26.686 --> 16:27.687
It could kill him.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.324
-We don't have a choice.
-There's always a choice.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.360
Our survival depends on
getting this information.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.628
Is that all you care about?
Survival?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.764
I swore to die fighting
for this resistance,

16:39.066 --> 16:42.369
but I am not gonna die
standing here waiting.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.072
You think you have
what it takes
to break my father's mind?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.640
More powerful Martians
than you have tried, boy.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.543
Enough. Till'all is right
about one thing.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.413
If we don't find
the staff soon,
we're finished.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.448
So you have to do this, J'onn.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.584
You have to get through
to your father. can you?

16:57.617 --> 16:58.585
I can.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.787
And I will.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.755
Good. So hurry.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.024
Because time is running out.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.841
You ever wonder, Kara,
what your parents
would say to you

17:21.874 --> 17:23.410
if they could see you now,

17:23.443 --> 17:24.511
after all this time?

17:25.845 --> 17:27.747
What they'd think of the person
you've become?

17:28.515 --> 17:29.582
Every day.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.485
They'd be proud of me.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.488
Yeah, I thought that too,

17:36.689 --> 17:38.425
and I actually
got the chance to ask.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.094
My father thinks I am a coward.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.397
Then he doesn't know you.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.734
'Cause the man I know
has dedicated his entire life

17:47.767 --> 17:50.670
to making sure
what happened on Mars
never happens anywhere else.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.374
So go in there, J'onn,

17:55.442 --> 17:57.610
and show your father
who his son really is.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.599
[speaking in Spanish]

18:19.632 --> 18:20.633
Dad.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.907
I wish you would have
called and told me
you were coming.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.776
I would have picked you
up at the airport.

18:29.809 --> 18:30.877
The bus was fine.

18:31.844 --> 18:32.845
Is Mom...

18:34.046 --> 18:36.383
No, your mother isn't coming.
She doesn't like to fly...

18:36.416 --> 18:37.617
Oh, you don't have to explain.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.556
Are you hungry?
We could grab a bite.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.558
The party of yours is soon, no?

18:45.725 --> 18:47.660
In a couple of hours,
but we have time.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.695
I can wait.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.499
I should probably check in
at the hotel.

18:52.532 --> 18:53.800
-Okay.
-I think it's this way.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.869
So...

18:57.970 --> 18:59.839
-You're a homicide detective?
-Yeah.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.641
Among other things.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.912
That cold case you cracked
sounded very interesting.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.447
The Martial murder.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.149
You know about that?

19:11.218 --> 19:12.419
Well, I'm an old man,
but I know how to Google.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.188
I follow all your cases.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.757
Tell me something.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.494
For 18 years they didn't
have a single lead.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.696
How did you solve that?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.499
I went back to the
scene of the crime,

19:26.699 --> 19:28.868
studied the ordinary details
everyone dismissed.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.937
Like you taught me.

19:32.239 --> 19:34.874
You used to say, "The key
to most mysteries
is in the mundane."

19:36.809 --> 19:37.844
You remember that.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.812
I remember everything
you taught me.

19:44.851 --> 19:49.188
[whirring]

19:51.624 --> 19:52.925
One thing I'll give you Whites,

19:53.826 --> 19:55.695
you don't take no
for an answer.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.499
As I told you before, Father,

19:59.999 --> 20:01.934
I am not a White Martian.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.241
Or even a Green Martian,
it seems.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.281
It is the custom of my people

20:14.747 --> 20:16.849
to take the shape
of our guests...

20:19.686 --> 20:22.221
for your comfort
if not for my own.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.257
[squelching]

20:26.726 --> 20:27.627
[sighs]

20:28.761 --> 20:30.930
I am well aware
of our Martian customs
and lore.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.633
Mars was once a paradise.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.537
But H'ronmeer

20:37.570 --> 20:40.507
wanted to test his children,
Phobos and Deimos.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.875
To be sure
they were worthy of it.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.646
So he offered them two gifts.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.548
A book of sacred symbols

20:49.649 --> 20:51.551
on morals
that govern Martian life,

20:52.785 --> 20:54.987
and the staff, a weapon.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.691
The symbols could be shared
but the staff
wielded by only one.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.261
Deimos chose the symbols.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.798
Phobos chose the staff.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.769
He was the first White Martian.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.573
H'ronmeer was furious

21:13.773 --> 21:17.810
that his son would choose
destruction over knowledge.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.048
And so, Phobos was banished
to the underworld.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.553
But his descendants
clawed their way back

21:26.586 --> 21:27.954
and slaughtered my people.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.689
Our people.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.924
I am your son.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.997
H'ronmeer buried the staff
for a reason.

21:39.932 --> 21:42.068
The Whites disgraced his name

21:42.101 --> 21:43.736
by slaughtering my people.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.672
I will serve my God

21:45.872 --> 21:48.641
by refusing
to let you use his staff

21:48.675 --> 21:50.309
to slaughter each other too.

21:58.084 --> 22:01.388
I'm sorry M'gann,
but I am doing this for us.

22:01.921 --> 22:02.822
[grunting]

22:02.855 --> 22:03.856
[dramatic music playing]

22:06.726 --> 22:07.627
[electricity buzzing]

22:13.766 --> 22:14.834
J'onn!

22:15.935 --> 22:17.604
We need
to get out of here now.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.338
I am not going anywhere
with you people.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.378
Sadly, I don't think you have
much of a choice.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.113
Where can we go?
Where is safe?

22:27.146 --> 22:28.047
Home.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.023
[door opens]

22:40.660 --> 22:41.394
[footsteps approaching]

22:49.502 --> 22:50.537
This was your home?

22:51.671 --> 22:52.672
No.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.374
It was mine.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.678
How dare you?

22:59.646 --> 23:02.715
-Father.
-How dare you bring me here?

23:05.685 --> 23:08.187
It was one thing to take
my son's form

23:08.220 --> 23:09.689
but to bring me back here,

23:10.857 --> 23:13.693
to the place where your people
stole our lives from us.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.695
I brought you here to prove it.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.398
If I wasn't your son,
how would I know this place?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.668
You've done...

23:22.802 --> 23:26.473
what your people couldn't do
for over two centuries.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.809
You've broken me.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.545
So kill me if you want,

23:32.945 --> 23:34.447
but until you do,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.849
I will spend my final moments

23:36.883 --> 23:39.852
praying for the ruins
of my slaughtered family.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.002
[upbeat instrumental rock music
playing]

23:57.269 --> 23:58.671
[indistinct chatter]

24:05.244 --> 24:09.248
Everybody! Everybody,
it is... trivia time.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.785
And Maggie,
you are in the hot seat.

24:12.819 --> 24:13.886
Thank God.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.688
-Have fun.
-Okay.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.558
Don't get too comfortable,
Danvers. You're up next.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.593
Doctor D, I got this.
All right.

24:20.993 --> 24:25.798
Here we go. What is
Alex's... favorite color?

24:25.832 --> 24:26.833
Blue.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.835
What is Alex's favorite animal?

24:28.868 --> 24:29.969
Uh, dog.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.705
What is Alex's
favorite ice cream?

24:32.739 --> 24:34.574
[woman]
Rocky road. Come on, man.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.610
Oh. Mr. Rodas.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.046
-Welcome.
-Hi.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.814
I'm sorry, I didn't know
what to bring.

24:41.848 --> 24:44.083
Oh, no, no. This is perfect.
Maggie loves Merlot.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.985
Can I offer you a drink?

24:46.953 --> 24:48.487
-Sure. Why not?
-Great.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.490
-Thank you.
-Yeah, cheers.

24:51.758 --> 24:52.759
Come in.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.061
Now, you're talking.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.064
Is this you here?

24:58.765 --> 24:59.732
Oh...

24:59.766 --> 25:01.200
[chuckles softly]

25:01.233 --> 25:04.503
Yes, I don't know
why I thought overalls
were cute in middle school.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.640
So, you are...

25:07.674 --> 25:09.642
The woman I am going to marry.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.785
Um, Papa,
meet Agent Alex Danvers.

25:19.919 --> 25:22.622
-Federal agent?
-Yes, sir.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.660
Margarita , there's no picture
of you up here.

25:29.095 --> 25:29.996
No.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.064
Here.

25:45.678 --> 25:46.679
Thank you, Papa.

25:48.014 --> 25:48.915
Yeah.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.784
Danvers, you're up.

25:52.018 --> 25:52.919
Oh.

25:54.253 --> 25:57.657
Okay, why don't we
just open the mountain
of presents instead.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.625
Okay.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.660
-Hi, I am Eliza.
-Sorry, mom.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.861
I'm the mom.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.832
Why don't we start
with this one for Maggie?

26:05.998 --> 26:07.634
Okay, thank you.

26:07.667 --> 26:08.567
Okay.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.571
Oh, I think I know
who this is from.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.140
Alex, before I open this,

26:15.541 --> 26:18.110
I want you to know
that you are the greatest gift
I could receive.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.147
I love you.

26:22.682 --> 26:23.582
[kisses]

26:26.819 --> 26:27.720
[intense music playing]

26:31.791 --> 26:32.792
Maggie.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.831
You're just gonna walk out?

26:39.666 --> 26:41.133
After all this time, that's it?

26:41.167 --> 26:43.069
-I can't do this.
-Can't do what?

26:44.170 --> 26:47.373
Tell me, please. What exactly
have I done that is
so offensive to you?

26:47.406 --> 26:49.742
-You spit in my face.
-I spit in your face?

26:50.877 --> 26:52.144
For loving somebody.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.082
I can't, I don't understand.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.651
I don't get it.

26:58.685 --> 27:00.619
I came to this country
nine years old.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.722
At eleven, I was
working in a factory.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.724
-Yes, I know. Yeah.
-Do you?

27:04.757 --> 27:06.025
Do you know
I was the only Mexicano

27:06.058 --> 27:07.359
working alongside
a bunch of white boys?

27:07.960 --> 27:10.129
Do you know that they
would wait for me
at night by the road,

27:10.429 --> 27:11.998
and laugh and call me wetback,

27:12.031 --> 27:13.866
and kick me
till my ribs were broken?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.102
-Dad what does this
have to do--
-With you being a lesbian?

27:18.237 --> 27:19.706
I worked...

27:20.907 --> 27:22.174
to win their respect.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.912
Those same boys,
when they grew up,
elected me their sheriff.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.715
I endured for my children...

27:29.448 --> 27:31.851
so that you would never have
to face that kind of hatred.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.185
So that you would belong.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.822
I am accepted for who I am.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.289
The world is different now.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.426
[laughs sarcastically]
They're building a wall
to keep us out

27:40.459 --> 27:43.029
because in their minds,
we are nothing
but rapists and murderers.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.999
The only thing they hate more
than a Mexicano

27:47.033 --> 27:48.267
is a homosexual.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.704
The world
is not different, my dear.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.240
Look.

27:55.474 --> 27:57.810
You can live
any way you please.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.013
But don't ask me to witness it.

28:12.825 --> 28:13.625
I'm...

28:15.494 --> 28:17.096
I'm sorry
to interrupt your prayers

28:17.129 --> 28:19.932
but I think it's important
that you hear me right now.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.702
What is left to say?

28:28.507 --> 28:29.708
Look at me.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.844
I'm not a White Martian.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.847
You can sense that, can't you?
You know it's true?

28:40.119 --> 28:41.487
You're Kryptonian.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.721
Yes, that's right.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.191
I come from the dead planet.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.260
I come from the dead people.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.229
Just like you.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.098
Krypton is gone.

28:52.932 --> 28:57.536
But my world remains,
and every day for 200 years,

28:57.569 --> 29:00.239
I have been forced
to remember the horror

29:00.272 --> 29:01.974
of what happened to my people.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.742
You're right.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.978
There is no future for Mars.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.914
Not for Green Martians, no.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.883
But this is
bigger than you now.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.285
This is about your faith.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.890
What do you know of my God?

29:18.590 --> 29:19.959
I heard you earlier.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.795
H'ronmeer tests us.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.764
This is a test.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.868
You have a chance
to save your planet.

29:28.901 --> 29:32.038
Not for your people, maybe,
but for another people

29:32.071 --> 29:34.240
who want to do better
than those that came before.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.076
I don't blame you
for not wanting to believe

29:37.109 --> 29:38.911
that J'onn
is actually your son.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.280
I don't blame you for not
wanting to open your mind

29:41.313 --> 29:43.282
because if it weren't true--

29:43.315 --> 29:46.118
It would be like losing him
all over again.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.254
Yes.

29:51.323 --> 29:56.195
Whether or not
you believe he is your son,
he wants to save Mars.

29:56.896 --> 30:00.900
So please, Myr'nn,
open your mind
just a little bit.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.068
Just give him a chance.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.379
May I?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.102
This is my favorite memory.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.206
This is our home, Father.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.044
I haven't thought about this
in a long time.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.246
Can you see it?

30:48.680 --> 30:49.982
I see it.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.218
I remember it.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.253
[kids chattering]

30:57.656 --> 31:00.092
K'hym, T'ania.

31:01.660 --> 31:02.995
My daughters.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.997
Your granddaughters.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.066
They're beautiful, J'onn.

31:07.433 --> 31:10.336
They were
excited about something.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.373
They were terrible
at keeping secrets.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.641
What did they know?

31:15.674 --> 31:18.377
That I had left worship early

31:19.145 --> 31:20.446
to surprise J'onn.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.151
K'hymm, T'ania.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.954
Look at you two.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.389
You're getting
much bigger, Kim.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.692
T'ania,
give me that smile. Yes.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.961
Does he know?

31:35.194 --> 31:36.462
Daddy doesn't know, does he?

31:42.268 --> 31:43.469
Did they tell you?

31:45.704 --> 31:47.940
-You came.
-Yes, I did.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.475
Happy birthday, my son.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.443
Thank you, Father. Thank you.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.012
Thank you for coming.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.214
You falsely
kept a secret.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.482
You kept a secret!

32:07.259 --> 32:08.260
J'onn.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.429
My son.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.231
Father.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.333
I missed you.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.204
I'm so sorry
for not believing you.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.438
I'm so sorry, J'onn.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.140
I'm the one
that should be sorry.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.510
How did you survive?

32:26.512 --> 32:27.980
Why did you come back here?

32:28.380 --> 32:31.150
The staff, Father. It's urgent.

32:31.317 --> 32:32.451
There's still time.

32:32.484 --> 32:33.986
No, there isn't.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.956
But we need the staff.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.958
Now.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.493
I'm sorry, J'onn.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.031
J'onn, it's okay.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.237
The staff isn't far.

32:52.404 --> 32:54.506
They're taking it to the hive
below the L'oren crater.

took a wrong turn
at Albuquerque and...

Can any of you give me
directions back to Earth?

J'onn.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.726
H'ronmeer's staff, Father.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.897
It's one thing
to dedicate your life to God,

36:39.665 --> 36:43.969
it's another thing
to see God's grace in person.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.406
So what happens to it now?

36:48.807 --> 36:49.941
I suppose that's up to them.

36:50.742 --> 36:51.577
Up to us?

36:51.610 --> 36:53.279
I saw what the staff
did back there.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.781
It's too powerful of a weapon
for either side to have.

36:55.814 --> 36:56.848
Take it to Earth.

36:57.048 --> 36:57.983
Bury it.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.285
If we're gonna win this planet,

36:59.985 --> 37:01.753
we have to be better
than our enemies.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.691
I underestimated you.

that I can persuade you
to come back to Earth.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.446
I'll see you soon.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.683
I hope that's true.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.991
So, what about your father?

37:56.775 --> 37:57.876
[Mr. Rodas] What are you
doing here?

37:58.677 --> 37:59.811
[Sawyer] Came
to give you that back.

38:01.880 --> 38:02.948
That little girl,

38:03.949 --> 38:06.785
so desperate to win
her father's love.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.390
You left her
on the side of the road.

38:12.691 --> 38:16.395
And all these years,
I've been that little girl.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.966
Yearning for my Papa
to come back for me.

he would see me and love me

Thank you for coming
to the shower.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.865
And I am so fortunate
that I am surrounded by people

38:54.466 --> 38:56.067
who value and cherish me.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.870
I finally understand
I don't need you

38:59.037 --> 39:01.740
to see me or to get me
or to even like me.

39:01.773 --> 39:04.410
I don't need anything from you.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.011
I'm already good.

39:14.453 --> 39:15.754
Goodbye, Papa.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.131
You're all the family I need.

39:30.802 --> 39:31.903
I'm happy for you.

39:33.038 --> 39:35.974

that you're getting closure.

39:36.007 --> 39:36.908
It's good for you.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.945
And who knows?

39:39.978 --> 39:43.882
It might make you
feel differently about things.

39:45.817 --> 39:46.918
Do you mean kids?

39:47.819 --> 39:48.820
Yeah.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.124
Sweetie, my not wanting kids

39:53.559 --> 39:56.094
has nothing to do
with my parents
or my childhood.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.165
My feelings for you are deeper
than anything I've ever known.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.501
I can picture
our life together.

40:02.968 --> 40:05.904
And it's full and rich and...

40:07.072 --> 40:08.073
amazing.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.177
But there aren't kids
in that picture.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.914
You're all that I need, Alex.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.586
I guess you gotta let me know
if you feel the same way.

40:23.188 --> 40:24.089
I do.

40:26.825 --> 40:27.859
Of course I do.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.096
[spaceship whirring]

40:35.867 --> 40:36.602
[door closes]

40:43.108 --> 40:44.109
Thank you, son.

40:46.612 --> 40:47.979
[Myr'nn] So, this is Earth.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.616
[Kara] This isn't
even the nice part.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.051
[Myr'nn] I don't know,
I rather like it.

41:02.528 --> 41:06.397
You know, I'm not sure I could
have done this without you.

41:10.268 --> 41:11.637
Yes, you could have.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.641
You're the strongest man
and Martian I've ever known,

41:17.142 --> 41:19.645
and I was glad I could be there
to help you anyway.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.113
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:22.147 --> 41:23.181
You got it, boss.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.084
Welcome to Earth, Mr. J'onzz,

41:27.018 --> 41:28.153
you raised a good one.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.264
Can everyone
on this planet do that?

41:40.165 --> 41:42.668
No. She's special.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.539
[Mr. Jonzz] So,
what do we do now?

41:47.906 --> 41:49.174
We go home, Father.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.042
We go home.

41:57.082 --> 41:58.216
