00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:15.999
- I want a real man.

00:15.999 --> 00:18.999
I want a bunch of real men.
I want to be a make out whore.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
- You f***ing nasty slut
you are. ****.

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
- You don't need
to spit on people.

00:22.999 --> 00:23.999
- I did not spit
on any f***ing girl,

00:23.999 --> 00:25.999
so don't f***ing tell me
that I am.

00:25.999 --> 00:28.999
- I just wish certain people
gave me, personally,

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
a reason to not like them.

00:30.999 --> 00:33.999
- Scheana will see a lot less
of me if Kristen's around.

00:33.999 --> 00:35.999
- What are we going to do
when I move up here?

00:35.999 --> 00:37.999
- You should stay with me.

00:37.999 --> 00:39.000
- So how's this girlfriend
of yours?

00:39.999 --> 00:40.999
- Let's easy with that word,
"girlfriend."

00:40.999 --> 00:42.999
- Go out for a drink and maybe--

00:42.999 --> 00:45.999
- You're paying
for all 17 of my cocktails.

00:45.999 --> 00:49.999
- We're going to Vegas!
- Whoo!

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
- Vegas is f***ing awesome.

00:50.999 --> 00:55.999
- Let's ruin everything by,
like, trying to f*** girls.

01:30.999 --> 01:31.999
Sandoval.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.999
- They're here.

01:35.999 --> 01:38.999
- Tom!

01:38.999 --> 01:39.999
They went on the Strip
last night.

01:39.999 --> 01:40.999
- I know.
That's a boy move.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.999
- I couldn't do it.

01:42.999 --> 01:44.999
Hey, where's Sandoval?

01:44.999 --> 01:45.999
- I lost Tom.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:45.999 --> 01:47.999
Like, emotionally?
Physically?

01:47.999 --> 01:49.999
- All those.
All of the above.

01:49.999 --> 01:52.999
- Oh, my God, dude.

01:52.999 --> 01:55.999
- He's got a beer
in his hands still.

01:55.999 --> 01:56.999
I'm going to bow down
to you, dude.

01:56.999 --> 01:57.999
You're a machine.

01:57.999 --> 01:58.999
- Now that Tom's back,
there's something

01:58.999 --> 02:00.999
I do want to show you guys.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
Katie was cool in letting me go
on the Vegas trip.

02:02.999 --> 02:04.999
In return, I felt
like I had to do something

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
to show my commitment
to her.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.999
What can I do that will last
a little longer than flowers?

02:09.999 --> 02:11.999
Hmm.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.999
- Oh, my God.
What the f***?

02:14.999 --> 02:16.999
What?

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
You got the word "Bubba"
on your ass.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.999
If you go to jail,
you're f***ed.

02:21.999 --> 02:22.999
- All right, I got one too.

02:22.999 --> 02:24.999
- What?
You got a tattoo too?

02:24.999 --> 02:25.999
- It's really bad.

02:25.999 --> 02:27.999
- Oh, my God, he did get one.
- Oh, my God.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
- What is it?

02:30.999 --> 02:33.999
- What?
Wait, let me see it.

02:33.999 --> 02:36.999
Oh, my God.

02:36.999 --> 02:37.999
Up until 4:00 a.m.,

02:37.999 --> 02:41.999
I was going to live the rest
of my life tattoo-free,

02:41.999 --> 02:43.999
like I have up to this point.

02:43.999 --> 02:44.999
I'm freaking out right now.

02:47.999 --> 02:50.999
- You're no longer a virgin
to the tattoo society.

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
Doesn't it make you want
to get another one?

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
- No.
- No, not at all, ever.

02:54.999 --> 02:55.999
- I mean, there's no other way
to say this.

02:55.999 --> 02:58.999
That is just--
that is f***ing awful.

02:58.999 --> 02:59.999
- Dude, stop.

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
- Are we packing?
- I'm driving straight to Sur.

03:01.999 --> 03:02.999
- Oh, my God.

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
- Sounds amazing.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
- It stinks in here.

03:06.999 --> 03:07.999
- Dude, my tattoo sucks.

03:07.999 --> 03:09.999
I'm having major anxiety
about it.

03:09.999 --> 03:10.999
- I don't think
you're giving it enough credit.

03:10.999 --> 03:12.999
It's cool.
- Dude, I'm embarrassed.

03:12.999 --> 03:13.999
I don't want to show Ariana.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
She's not going
to love me anymore.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
I hate myself.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
I'm really hoping that Ariana's
going to like the tattoo

03:19.999 --> 03:20.999
and put my worries at ease.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.999
- I had a great trip.

03:22.999 --> 03:25.999
Everything was cool until
you guys got those tattoos.

03:25.999 --> 03:30.999
- ♪ It's not always gonna be
black and white ♪

03:30.999 --> 03:31.999

03:31.999 --> 03:32.999

03:34.999 --> 03:38.999

03:41.999 --> 03:43.999
- Hi, there.
I got a text from the boys.

03:43.999 --> 03:44.999
- Oh, really?

03:44.999 --> 03:45.999
- They're on their way home,
but I have a feeling

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
that they're going to be
chasing the clock.

03:47.999 --> 03:50.999
- He's going to be really smelly
and really tired,

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
and his mom's coming
into town.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.000
- When?
- Tomorrow.

03:54.999 --> 03:55.999
- Oh, that's good timing.
- Yeah, really good timing.

03:55.999 --> 03:56.999
- Yeah.

03:56.999 --> 03:58.999
I hope Tom doesn't stumble
off that struggle bus

03:58.999 --> 04:00.999
looking for any sympathy
from me,

04:00.999 --> 04:02.999
'cause he's
not going to get it.

04:02.999 --> 04:05.000
And we're supposed
to do that diary show.

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
- So you're reading
from an actual diary?

04:06.999 --> 04:09.999
- One that I found that my mom
sent me is

04:09.999 --> 04:12.999
from, like, right when
I first showed up to college.

04:12.999 --> 04:15.999
My friend Lindsay has been
doing this show

04:15.999 --> 04:20.999
where people get up and read
from their old journals.

04:20.999 --> 04:21.999
I mean, there's some stuff
that I'm like,

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
that's funny and embarrassing,

04:23.999 --> 04:26.999
and then some stuff
that's, like, just embarrassing.

04:26.999 --> 04:29.999
I've done a ton of shorts

04:30.000 --> 04:32.999
for different comedic websites

04:32.999 --> 04:35.999
that all have, like,
millions and millions of views.

04:35.999 --> 04:36.999
I'm not a comic who can act.

04:36.999 --> 04:40.999
I'm an actress who's funny
and understands comedy.

04:40.999 --> 04:41.999
- But does--Sandoval doesn't
keep, like, a diary.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.999
What is he going to read?

04:43.999 --> 04:45.999
- Oh, my God, he has, like,
notebooks upon notebooks

04:45.999 --> 04:49.999
upon notebooks of song lyrics.
- Oh, my God.

04:49.999 --> 04:50.999
Well, that's going
to be very interesting.

04:50.999 --> 04:51.999
I'm excited.
It'll be fun.

04:51.999 --> 04:53.999
But I'm going
to get back to work.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
What if they come back, and
they're like, "Oh, hey, sorry.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
"I know, like, we didn't want
to upset you while we were away,

04:57.999 --> 04:59.000
"like, but we did actually.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.999
We got f***ed up,
and we, like, cheated on you."

05:00.999 --> 05:01.999
- What if Jax
got somebody pregnant?

05:01.999 --> 05:03.000
- No, stop.

05:03.999 --> 05:04.999
- Well, he wouldn't know yet
anyway, I mean.

05:04.999 --> 05:05.999
- All right, don't put
those things out there.

05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
They were good.
They were good.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
They were good.

05:13.999 --> 05:15.000
- Dude, we need to get ready.
- Where's my backpack?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.999
- I didn't bring it.
- I don't have socks.

05:17.999 --> 05:18.999
- Tom?
- I don't have any--Schwartz.

05:18.999 --> 05:21.999
Ow, damn.

05:21.999 --> 05:22.999
Oh, f***!

05:22.999 --> 05:26.999
- Ah,
dude, my tattoo hurts.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
- Tweedle-Dee here
and Tweedle-f***ing idiot

05:28.999 --> 05:29.999
with his bacon A.

05:29.999 --> 05:31.999
Ariana hates everything.

05:31.999 --> 05:32.999
She's going
to f***ing hate that.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
I hate that,
and I'm all about tattoos.

05:37.999 --> 05:38.999
- Hello?

05:38.999 --> 05:39.999
- Hey, Lisa, it's Peter.
How's it going?

05:39.999 --> 05:42.999
- Peter, where are you?
- We hit some traffic,

05:42.999 --> 05:44.999
but we're almost there.
We're, like, two minutes away.

05:44.999 --> 05:45.999
- You're late.
- Okay.

05:45.999 --> 05:46.999
Yeah, no, we're coming.

05:46.999 --> 05:48.999
We're coming--
I'm coming as fast as I can.

05:48.999 --> 05:49.999
- Do you have your uniforms
with you?

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
- Yes.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
- Did you leave them
in some hotel room?

05:52.999 --> 05:53.999
- We got 'em.
- No, we have our uniforms.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.999
- Are you clean
and ready for work?

05:55.999 --> 05:57.999
- Ish.
- Clean-ish.

05:57.999 --> 05:59.999
- Ish.
- Hurry up!

05:59.999 --> 06:00.999
- All right, we're on it.
We're on it.

06:00.999 --> 06:02.999
- She's not going to like
the way we smell.

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
- Oh, f***!

06:08.999 --> 06:10.999
- Lobster bisque is our soup.

06:10.999 --> 06:14.000
The fish of the night is
a pan-roasted Chilean sea bass.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
- All right, here we go.
Here we go.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
- I shouldn't even get out.

06:18.999 --> 06:20.999
- Oh, here you are.

06:20.999 --> 06:22.999
Peter, that's not
"ready to go."

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
Sandoval, get in here.
Did you behave yourself?

06:24.999 --> 06:25.999
- Turn around.
- I can't show Lisa.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.999
- Yes.
Look--look what he did.

06:27.999 --> 06:28.999
- What?
- Is it appropriate?

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
- Yeah, it's appropriate.
- What?

06:30.999 --> 06:33.999
- I did something stupid
when I was drunk.

06:33.999 --> 06:34.999
- What?
- He got a tattoo.

06:34.999 --> 06:38.999
- Oh, come on.
I don't want to see this.

06:38.999 --> 06:39.999
Oh, my God!
- It says "Bubba."

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
It's commitment.
It's a sign of commitment.

06:41.999 --> 06:42.999
- Is that permanent?
- Yeah.

06:42.999 --> 06:43.999
- Let's look at Tom's.
- Oh, no.

06:43.999 --> 06:44.999
- Dude, mine is really bad.

06:44.999 --> 06:45.999
- You didn't?
You stupid--

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
- Mine's real bad.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
It's an "A" for Ariana.

06:49.999 --> 06:50.999
- Oh, my God.

06:50.999 --> 06:52.999
This is the worst tattoo
I've ever seen.

06:52.999 --> 06:54.999
I thought these guys
were stupid,

06:54.999 --> 06:58.999
but every time they take the
stupidity to a whole new level.

06:58.999 --> 06:59.999
Oh, no,
I don't want you to hug me.

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
Get in there now.
Get in there.

07:01.999 --> 07:02.999
Schwartzy, you go home.

07:02.999 --> 07:04.999
Schwartz, go home.

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
- I'm supposed to say "hi."
I want to give her a kiss.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
- Okay, I'll send her out.

07:07.999 --> 07:08.999
- Good to see you.
You look amazing.

07:08.999 --> 07:11.999
- Don't start sweet-talking me,
Schwartzy.

07:15.999 --> 07:16.999
- Hi, ladies.
How are you?

07:16.999 --> 07:17.999
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- Of course.

07:22.999 --> 07:24.999
- Oh, sh**.

07:24.999 --> 07:28.999
- Bubba! Have a kissy.
- Hi.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.999
- Am I stinky? I stink.
I missed you.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
- You stink.
- Yeah.

07:32.999 --> 07:35.999
Oh, it was so fun.
We were really well-behaved.

07:35.999 --> 07:38.999
- Are you sure?

07:38.999 --> 07:39.999
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:39.999 --> 07:42.999
- How's it going?
- Do you have my money?

07:42.999 --> 07:44.999
- What?
- Didn't you win money in Vegas?

07:44.999 --> 07:45.999
- I did.
- Then where is it?

07:45.999 --> 07:46.999
- It's right here.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.000
- My hand is open.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.999
Waiting.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
No.
Uh-uh.

07:51.999 --> 07:52.999
- So there's not going to be,
like, something

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
that comes up where it's like--

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
- I don't want to drop a bomb
on you at work.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.999
I did do something
kind of stupid.

07:58.999 --> 07:59.999
- Actually, there's something

07:59.999 --> 08:03.999
that me and Schwartz
got to tell you.

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
- I tattooed your name
on my ass.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.999
- No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.

08:07.999 --> 08:11.999
- I did.
I was really drunk.

08:11.999 --> 08:12.999
- Oh, my God, you did.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.999
- I know.

08:14.999 --> 08:15.999
- Oh, my God.

08:15.999 --> 08:17.999
- Bubba.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
- Oh, my God.
- It's a sign of commitment.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.000
It's tender.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.999
I need to put some cream
on there or something.

08:23.999 --> 08:24.999
Ow! Bubba!

08:24.999 --> 08:26.999
- What the f***!

08:26.999 --> 08:27.999
- I was really drunk.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.999
- Take deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.999
In through your nose.
Out your mouth.

08:31.999 --> 08:33.999
- Oh, my God.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
I'm just shocked
that he got a tattoo in general,

08:35.999 --> 08:38.999
because he will faint
at the sight of a needle.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
I can't believe
you got a tattoo.

08:40.999 --> 08:41.999
- Bubba.
Do you like it?

08:41.999 --> 08:43.999
- I think so.

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
I will say he's screwed
if he ever goes to prison.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
- What?
- I did something bad.

08:49.999 --> 08:51.999
- I did something bad
in Vegas too.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.999
- Did you guys get married?

08:53.999 --> 08:54.999
- I'll take accountability
on this one.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.999
- You want to stop
building it up, and go ahead,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.999
and just go for it,
so I can get my--

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
That's so bad.

09:04.999 --> 09:05.999
- Is that a dragon?

09:05.999 --> 09:08.999
- It's a bad, bad "A."
- It's raised a little bit.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.999
- Tom, that's so gross.

09:10.999 --> 09:13.999
- Get out of here.
Take it in.

09:13.999 --> 09:14.999
- I'm sorry.

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
- Why did you ruin your ass
like that?

09:19.999 --> 09:22.999
Why would he think
that he should surprise me

09:22.999 --> 09:24.000
with such a thing?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
I do really hate it.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.999
I'm never going to want
to look at it ever again.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
- Dude, it's so cute.
- What?

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
- Oh, God.
Here.

09:32.999 --> 09:34.999
You're going to need this
for your laser treatment.

09:34.999 --> 09:37.999
- Oh, sh**.

09:37.999 --> 09:38.999
- Coming up.

09:38.999 --> 09:39.999
- I've been in therapy
for nine months for a reason.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.999
- I know.
- Mostly about James.

09:41.999 --> 09:42.999
- You've got to go in calm.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.000
- She may tell me
to go f*** myself.

09:44.999 --> 09:45.999
- You can't go in--
- Jax, when am I not calm?

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
- Kristen, really?

09:47.999 --> 09:49.999
Lightning's gonna strike.

09:57.999 --> 10:00.999
♪ Throw it up
and let it all fall ♪

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey.

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
- Hi.
- How's it going?

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
- Why?
What tattoo did you get?

10:07.999 --> 10:08.999
- What do you think?
- Schwartz's is awesome.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.999
I would get it.

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
It's tasteful.
It's nice. It's small.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
- I think it's great.
- And then I saw--

10:13.999 --> 10:14.999
- I just can't believe
they did it.

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
- I haven't seen either yet.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
I just heard that Sandoval's
looks like bacon.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.999
Out of all
of the terrible decisions

10:20.000 --> 10:21.999
Tom could have made
in Vegas,

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
this is the best
of the bad ones.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
- Peter and I went to bed early.

10:25.999 --> 10:26.999
These guys came strolling in--
- So wait, wait, wait.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
You didn't have sex
and you went to bed early?

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
- And you didn't get a tattoo?

10:30.999 --> 10:31.999
- Who are you?
- I don't know.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
- Dude, someone better go
check on hell, right?

10:33.999 --> 10:37.999
- Are you, like, a changed man?
Is Brittany the one?

10:37.999 --> 10:38.999
- I mean...
- When does--

10:38.999 --> 10:39.999
When is Brittany
getting to town?

10:39.999 --> 10:43.999
- Brittany is moving from
Kentucky to L.A. to be with me.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
I guess it really hasn't
sunk in yet.

10:45.999 --> 10:46.999
She's moving in with me.

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
I feel like--yeah.

10:48.999 --> 10:49.999
I feel like she's my girlfriend.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.999
I really don't see any other way
out of this one.

10:52.999 --> 10:53.999
You know, the only one
who's single right now,

10:53.999 --> 10:55.999
shockingly, is Kristen.

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
- I'm glad.
I hope she stays single.

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
- She wants to go on dates.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.000
Like, I'm like,
"Let's go to a bar.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.999
Let's--let me
be your wingman."

11:01.999 --> 11:04.999
- Clearly if anyone knows how to
get laid at a bar, it is you.

11:04.999 --> 11:05.999
- And you can always lead
with this.

11:05.999 --> 11:09.999
"Hey, man, I can tell you.
I know from experience."

11:11.999 --> 11:13.999
- You know, but this is
the Kristen that I love.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.999
Like, she's, like, getting
back to, like, her old self.

11:16.999 --> 11:17.999
- I do too.
- There's an issue though.

11:17.999 --> 11:18.999
Tom and I have been
talking about it.

11:18.999 --> 11:20.999
We want to do
a joint birthday trip.

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
- Dude, I think we should take
a trip for our birthday.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
- I want to do a trip
for our birthday.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
- This wasn't even a realistic
possibility last year--

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
a dual birthday
between you guys.

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
- I think we should take a trip
that involves the girls.

11:30.999 --> 11:31.999
- That's exactly what I--
- Because that was f***ed up.

11:31.999 --> 11:34.999
- The trips and the separating
of sexes is dumb.

11:34.999 --> 11:35.999
- There's an issue though.

11:35.999 --> 11:36.999
I don't mind Kristen going.

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
I want her to come.
I do.

11:38.999 --> 11:39.999
- I think it'd be fun
to have her.

11:39.999 --> 11:40.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:40.999 --> 11:41.999
- She's been a lot of fun
lately.

11:41.999 --> 11:42.999
- I agree.

11:42.999 --> 11:43.999
- I like hanging out
with Kristen,

11:43.999 --> 11:46.999
because Ariana is always doing
God knows what with Sandoval,

11:46.999 --> 11:48.999
just the two of them.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
I feel like I'm cheating
on Ariana with Kristen,

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
but the truth is,
she's a lot of fun.

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
- I just think
it's going to be a tough sell.

11:54.999 --> 11:55.999
- Mm-hmm.
- And if she can't come,

11:55.999 --> 11:56.999
this is going to kill her.

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
Let's keep this on the hush
for a little bit.

11:58.999 --> 11:59.999
- Yeah, my lips are sealed.
- Okay.

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
- I won't talk to anyone.

12:07.999 --> 12:08.999
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, what's up?

12:08.999 --> 12:11.999
You guys working tonight?
- Yeah, no, we're off.

12:11.999 --> 12:12.999
We're just coming in
to have dinner.

12:12.999 --> 12:13.999
My mom's here.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.999
- Awesome.
Four of you?

12:15.999 --> 12:16.999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:16.999 --> 12:17.999
- That's all right.
I know where I'm going.

12:17.999 --> 12:19.999
Yeah.
Thank you.

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
I'm excited for my mom
to see where I live,

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
but obviously,
when your mom comes,

12:23.999 --> 12:26.999
you do a little extra
mom sprucing up.

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
- I put my bong up
in the cabinet.

12:28.999 --> 12:29.999
- Okay.
- So I don't think

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
your mom will see it.
- All right, that's good.

12:31.999 --> 12:33.999
- Hello.
Welcome to Sur.

12:33.999 --> 12:34.999
How are we doing this evening?

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
- Scheana, what's up?
You remember my mom.

12:36.999 --> 12:37.999
- Yes. How are you?
I'll give you a hug.

12:37.999 --> 12:38.999
- I'm doing good.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
How are you doing?
You look great.

12:40.999 --> 12:41.999
- Good.
Thank you.

12:41.999 --> 12:42.999
- I've heard Tom tell
some really good stories,

12:42.999 --> 12:44.999
but I want to get it from you.

12:44.999 --> 12:45.999
- My input?
- Yes.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
- When he was in third grade--

12:47.999 --> 12:48.999
comes to me and says,

12:48.999 --> 12:51.999
"Mom, I want to be
in the talent contest."

12:51.999 --> 12:53.999
Anyway, he goes, "I'm going to
dance and lip sync and stuff."

12:53.999 --> 12:56.999
I said okay.
Well, there was 25 acts.

12:56.999 --> 13:00.999
24 acts of girls and Tom.

13:00.999 --> 13:05.999
He freaking stole the show
and took first place.

13:05.999 --> 13:06.999
Yeah!

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
- I've spent lots of time
with Tom's mom.

13:08.999 --> 13:13.999
She's a really smart, strong,
fun lady to be around.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
- Tom's definitely not shy.
- No.

13:15.999 --> 13:18.999
- Sometimes.
I grew up in St. Louis.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.000
My parents divorced
at an early age.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.999
She definitely had to have
the physicality

13:22.000 --> 13:23.999
to be able to separate
me and my brother

13:23.999 --> 13:24.999
when we would fight.

13:24.999 --> 13:26.999
My mom has always been
a real badass.

13:26.999 --> 13:30.000
My toughness and a little bit
of my cockiness

13:30.000 --> 13:33.999
and my perseverance
sort of come from my mom.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.999
- Oh, hello.
This looks very grown-up.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
- This is my mom, Terri.
- I'm Terri.

13:38.999 --> 13:40.999
- This is Lisa, my boss.
- Hello.

13:40.999 --> 13:41.999
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you too.

13:41.999 --> 13:44.999
- This is where I get
my tough side from.

13:44.999 --> 13:45.999
- "Tough side"?

13:45.999 --> 13:46.999
- My mom's a firefighter.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
- Firefighter.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

13:48.999 --> 13:49.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:49.999 --> 13:50.999
- 28 years.

13:50.999 --> 13:51.999
- Where's your uniform?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
Normally I hit on people
when they're wearing

13:53.999 --> 13:54.999
firefighting uniforms.

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
I find them very attractive.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.999
- I got to tell you guys
a story.

13:58.999 --> 13:59.999
My parents got divorced.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
My mom lived
in this apartment building.

14:01.999 --> 14:04.999
She closes a door
and gets locked out.

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
All of a sudden
it's like "Jurassic Park."

14:06.999 --> 14:07.999
It's like--

14:07.999 --> 14:09.000
And I'll never forget.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.999
There's my mom.
She's like, "boom!"

14:11.999 --> 14:14.999
Kicks the f***ing door in
in her flip-flops.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.999
I was like--

14:17.999 --> 14:19.999
- I've done it before.
I used to have to do it.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
- Why are you such a baby then?

14:21.999 --> 14:22.999
- I'm not.

14:22.999 --> 14:23.999
- Having a mother
like this, huh?

14:23.999 --> 14:26.999
Kind of interesting to me
that this woman

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
who's kind of heroic, really--
she gave birth

14:28.999 --> 14:31.999
to this young man
that shaves his forehead

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
and plucks his eyebrows.

14:33.999 --> 14:34.999
- Thank you so much.
- A pleasure to have met you.

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
I mean really.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
- It's very nice
to meet you too.

14:37.999 --> 14:39.999
- So, dude, you missed
a lot of debauchery in Vegas.

14:39.999 --> 14:42.999
- Tom came back
with a souvenir.

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
- I did.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
- You did what?

14:46.999 --> 14:49.999
- I got a--
I got a tattoo.

14:49.999 --> 14:52.999
- Oh, my God.
You got to be kidding me.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
What kind of tattoo?
Where'd you get it?

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
- I got it on my butt.
- Oh, that's lovely.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
- And it looks like bacon.
- And it's really--

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
- I'm stunned.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
I never thought he'd get
a tattoo.

15:01.999 --> 15:02.999
- It's okay.
We're going to have it removed.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
- I will, Ariana.
Relax.

15:04.999 --> 15:08.000
The fact that the tattoo looks
so bad is deeming it impossible

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
for Ariana to have any sort
of appreciation

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
for the thought behind it.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
It still hurts too.

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
- Does it?
- Yeah.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
- Serves you right there,
mister.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.999
- Ugh, Mom.

15:19.999 --> 15:20.999
- Thomas.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.999
- Well, well, well.
Look at you.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
Ooh!
Hello.

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
- I'm scared.

15:38.999 --> 15:39.999
- You got your f*** me heels on.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
- Fake lashes.
- You got the boobs going.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
You got the fake lashes.
- Lots of black eye makeup.

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
- You got the sex hair going.
- Things are--yeah.

15:44.999 --> 15:46.999
Freshly f***ed.

15:46.999 --> 15:48.999
- Freshly f***ed.
I like that.

15:48.999 --> 15:49.999
- I need a cocktail.

15:49.999 --> 15:52.999
Jax has a lot of experience
being single

15:52.999 --> 15:53.999
and a little slutty,

15:53.999 --> 15:56.999
so if I'm going to be single
and mingling,

15:56.999 --> 15:58.999
I need to know
what the players are thinking,

15:58.999 --> 15:59.999
and that's why I need Jax.

15:59.999 --> 16:02.999
no guys in their 20s.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.999
- No.

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
- Guys don't even know who the
f*** they are in their 20s.

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
- True.
- You need to date somebody

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
who has a job, has a car--
- Because I have

16:08.999 --> 16:10.999
my sh** together.
I'm not a crazy bitch anymore.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.999
I'm f***ing cool,

16:12.999 --> 16:15.999
and I still would really like--
which I've expressed to you

16:15.999 --> 16:16.999
and Scheana and even Katie

16:16.999 --> 16:19.999
that I would like to have
a conversation with Ariana.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
- And I think you should.
- It may not be very receptive--

16:21.999 --> 16:23.000
- Doesn't matter
if it's receptive or not.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.999
- But I know what I want
to say to Ariana.

16:24.999 --> 16:27.999
Like, I have legit things that I
want to talk to her about.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.999
Like, it's very simple.

16:29.999 --> 16:31.999
I know that she may totally
reject me, and that's fine.

16:31.999 --> 16:32.999
Scheana and I have
talked about it.

16:32.999 --> 16:33.999
- You've got to go in calm.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.000
- She may tell me
to go f*** myself.

16:35.999 --> 16:37.000
- You can't go in--
- Jax, when am I not calm?

16:37.999 --> 16:38.999
- Kristen, really?

16:38.999 --> 16:39.999
Lightning's gonna strike.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.999
- I've been in therapy
for nine months for a reason.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.000
- And I know.
- Mostly about James.

16:43.999 --> 16:44.999
- I hate James; I hate him.
- But it's like--

16:44.999 --> 16:46.999
- When he have events
or we have gatherings,

16:46.999 --> 16:48.999
I don't want him there.
I don't want him there.

16:48.999 --> 16:50.999
- I now realize that James
was my rebound.

16:50.999 --> 16:52.999
I didn't think that he was.
- We told you.

16:52.999 --> 16:53.999
Everyone told you
he was a rebound.

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
- I know.

16:54.999 --> 16:56.999
- I think single is gonna be
a great look for Kristen.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.999
I really want to
see her happy,

16:58.999 --> 17:00.999
but, to be honest with you,

17:00.999 --> 17:01.999
anything is better
than dating James.

17:01.999 --> 17:03.000
- Like, I'm a catch,

17:03.999 --> 17:04.000
but I know I'm a catch.
That's the thing.

17:04.999 --> 17:05.000
- You are.
- I'm not trying

17:05.999 --> 17:06.999
to convince you or--

17:06.999 --> 17:08.000
- This is good.
Right now, this sells itself.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
It's like, you're beautiful.
You're going to sell this.

17:10.999 --> 17:14.999
The only thing that's going
to f*** it up is your mouth.

17:14.999 --> 17:15.999
Even if she has
to lower her standards--

17:15.999 --> 17:17.999
flush 'em down the toilet--

17:17.999 --> 17:19.999
she's going to make out
with at least one person.

17:19.999 --> 17:20.999
I think we need to find a guy
who maybe--

17:20.999 --> 17:21.999
who has shaved before.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
- Other than his forehead?

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
The thing is I've been
dating broke musicians

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
for the last eight years,
so the last thing that I need

17:27.999 --> 17:30.999
is a 24-year-old mactor
that just moved to Los Angeles.

17:30.999 --> 17:31.999
- I'm Jax.
- Oh, Jax.

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
- How you doing?
- I'm her brother.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
- Oh,
you're a good-looking family.

17:35.999 --> 17:37.999
- What's your story?

17:37.999 --> 17:40.999
- Is that your polite way of
asking what I do for a living?

17:40.999 --> 17:41.999
- I actually--no, no.

17:41.999 --> 17:42.999
Actually I want to know

17:42.999 --> 17:44.999
what, like, what your likes
and dislikes are.

17:44.999 --> 17:46.999
Like, what's
your favorite donut?

17:46.999 --> 17:47.999
- Dude's got
to be taller than me.

17:47.999 --> 17:49.999
That is a prerequisite.

17:49.999 --> 17:52.999
If you don't reach 6'1", like,
you're a no-go.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
Are you an actor?

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
- I mean, technically, I'm
more of a model than an actor.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
I just got signed to an agency.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.999
- We're honestly the
best-looking motherf***ers here.

18:03.999 --> 18:04.999
- We are!
We are the best-looking.

18:04.999 --> 18:05.999
- I'm not gonna lie to you.
I hate it.

18:05.999 --> 18:06.999
I hate being
really good-looking.

18:06.999 --> 18:08.999
- And we're really tall.

18:10.999 --> 18:11.999
- I like this guy.

18:11.999 --> 18:12.999
- How old are you?

18:12.999 --> 18:14.999
I'm 32.
How old are you?

18:14.999 --> 18:17.999
- I'm 24.

18:17.999 --> 18:20.999
I'm not an actor
or a model, so that--

18:20.999 --> 18:21.999
We good?

18:21.999 --> 18:23.999
- Yeah.

18:23.999 --> 18:24.999
- Do you need water?
- No.

18:24.999 --> 18:25.999
- A drink of water?

18:28.999 --> 18:29.999
- Yes!

18:29.999 --> 18:32.999
Whoo!
Mission accomplished.

18:36.999 --> 18:37.999
- Coming up.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
- Whether you're frolicking
through a meadow,

18:39.999 --> 18:43.999
or taking a sh** in the street,
I don't give a f***.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.999
Just stay away from me.

18:54.999 --> 18:56.999
- ♪ Everyone else
is having their fun ♪

18:56.999 --> 18:59.999
♪ Don't you get uptight
doesn't help none ♪

18:59.999 --> 19:02.000
♪ I guess I could get behind
get behind this ♪

19:02.999 --> 19:03.000
- Hi.

19:03.999 --> 19:06.999
- Bubba.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
- Did you see that?
- How did you think I know?

19:08.999 --> 19:11.000
- Well, like, he pulled down
his pants and showed you?

19:11.999 --> 19:13.999
- Well, he only showed me
a little bit of it.

19:13.999 --> 19:14.999
So now you're on his ass.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
Well, you've been on his tail
for a long time.

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
- I feel like,
at this point, he's, like,

19:18.999 --> 19:20.999
screwing with me
a little bit.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
You know, first it's,
like, the dog.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
What is this?
Did you just get a dog?

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
- It's a little old man
who's come to live with us.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
- And then, you know,
that stupid ring on a string.

19:28.999 --> 19:30.000
Putting a ring on a string?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.999
- Well, but don't think
too much about it.

19:31.999 --> 19:32.999
It's not string.
It's a gold necklace.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.999
- Now this tattoo
where it's like--

19:34.999 --> 19:37.999
obviously, there's, like,
commitment there, but--

19:37.999 --> 19:38.999
- What would you rather?

19:38.999 --> 19:41.999
Would you rather
the tattoo on his ass

19:41.999 --> 19:44.999
or would you rather
the ring on the string?

19:44.999 --> 19:45.999
- Tattoo on the ass.

19:45.999 --> 19:48.999
- See, that's permanent.
One step closer, baby.

19:48.999 --> 19:51.999
Schwartzy has "Bubba"
on his ass.

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
We could be heading
in the right direction.

19:53.999 --> 19:55.999
I don't think he
would tell me anyway, would he?

19:55.999 --> 19:58.999
- Maybe.
He obviously admires you.

19:58.999 --> 19:59.999
- He loves me.
Are you kidding me?

19:59.999 --> 20:00.999
- He adores you.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.999
- He's going to ask me
before you.

20:03.999 --> 20:04.999
You know what?

20:04.999 --> 20:05.999
- I would not be surprised.

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
- So if I turn him down,
then I'll send him--

20:07.999 --> 20:08.999
- Oh, God.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
- Hi, papi.

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
- Hi, babe.
- How you feeling?

20:17.999 --> 20:20.999
You were a little drunky-skunky
last night.

20:20.999 --> 20:22.999
- I'm good.

20:22.999 --> 20:23.999
You know, me and Lala
were bouncing back.

20:23.999 --> 20:27.999
We're, like,
making out left and right,

20:27.999 --> 20:28.999
but I still
haven't sealed the deal.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
So we're good?
Everything's cool?

20:30.999 --> 20:32.999
- Of course we're good,
my love.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
You know
I don't hold grudges.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.999
I forgive and forget so quickly.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
It doesn't mean I want to be
in a relationship.

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
He's just fun
to make out with.

20:40.999 --> 20:41.999
I had fun, though,
with you, babe.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.000
- I had fun too.
I'm glad we're, like, you know,

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
back to our little fun times.

20:47.999 --> 20:48.999
- We'll always be friends,
yeah.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.999
- I've got one small,
small thing.

20:51.999 --> 20:53.999
- Oh, God. Okay.
What did I do?

20:53.999 --> 20:55.999
- You can do whatever you want.
Just stop flirting with Jax.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
It makes me f***ing livid.

20:57.999 --> 21:01.999
- I like who I like, and I
don't like who I don't like.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.999
I can make my own judgments.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
- Lala's flirting with Jax
annoys me,

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
because I feel like I'm just so
much better than him, dude.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
I'm just so much
better than him.

21:09.999 --> 21:10.999
He's just such a f***ing idiot.

21:10.999 --> 21:12.999
So, did you hear
about those tattoos

21:12.999 --> 21:13.999
that Schwartz and Tom got?

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
- No.
- They got f***ing,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.999
like, matching ass tattoos
in Vegas, apparently.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
- Shut the f*** up.
- Yeah.

21:21.999 --> 21:22.999
I heard Tom's one's
f***ed up, yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.999
- So Scheana ended up
inviting me to her little,

21:25.999 --> 21:26.999
like, girls slumber party.

21:26.999 --> 21:27.999
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, and we were

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
FaceTiming
with the boys,

21:29.999 --> 21:30.999
and they didn't say anything
about it.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.999
- So you guys are getting along?
- And we all kissed.

21:33.999 --> 21:34.999
- What?

21:36.999 --> 21:39.999
- Oh, damn, Gina.

21:43.999 --> 21:45.999
- Who's the best kisser?

21:45.999 --> 21:46.999
- Scheana, dude.
- Really?

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
- Tequila makes me make out
with anybody.

21:48.999 --> 21:51.999
- We should go for margaritas
after work.

22:01.999 --> 22:03.999
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
- Hi.
Are you having dinner?

22:05.999 --> 22:07.999
- I was just, like,
in the area, so I was like,

22:07.999 --> 22:09.999
"I want to stop by
for good old times' sake."

22:09.999 --> 22:11.999
Are you busy right now?

22:11.999 --> 22:12.999
- Well, I'm going to try
to take a break in a minute,

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
if you want to come out back
for old times' sake.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.999
- Yeah.
Here we go.

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
- Okay, well,
I'll be right there.

22:17.999 --> 22:18.999
- All right.
- I'll be out there.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
- All bad feelings,
or tension,

22:20.999 --> 22:23.999
animosity has really
dissolved with Kristen.

22:23.999 --> 22:24.999
Hey.

22:24.999 --> 22:27.999
I'm glad that we can be cool
and not have to pretend,

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999
like, we're strangers.

22:29.999 --> 22:30.999
It's white wine spritzer.

22:30.999 --> 22:33.999
There's not a lot of wine.

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
- There's no wine
in this at all.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
It's a club soda.

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
I was actually just
going to ask you--

22:38.000 --> 22:39.999
I'm ready
for your shocked face,

22:39.999 --> 22:42.999
but I kind of want to
talk to Ariana.

22:42.999 --> 22:44.999
I don't know if this is
a good place to do it,

22:44.999 --> 22:46.999
but I don't know

22:46.999 --> 22:49.999
how else I would ever
really run into her, you know.

22:49.999 --> 22:50.999
- What are you planning
on saying?

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
Or, you know, what do you
want to get out of it?

22:52.999 --> 22:57.999
- Honestly,
I want to apologize.

22:57.999 --> 23:00.999
- I mean, I don't know if it's
going to be received very well.

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
- How she'd react, yeah.
- It can't hurt anything.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
- No. I mean,
I'm pretty well aware

23:04.999 --> 23:05.999
that she's probably going to
tell me to f*** off.

23:05.999 --> 23:08.999
That's fine. I'm not doing it
so she and I can be friends,

23:08.999 --> 23:09.999
but because I've been, like,

23:09.999 --> 23:11.999
hanging out with, like, you,
and Scheana, and Jax,

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
and, like, really trying to
just mend all of,

23:13.999 --> 23:14.999
like, the broken bridges.

23:14.999 --> 23:17.999
- I'm just happy
that you are coming to terms

23:17.999 --> 23:18.999
and realizing things.

23:18.999 --> 23:19.999
- Yeah.
- That makes me happy

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
to see that, and I hope
you continue to do that,

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
because it's a huge, like--it's
like a personal breakthrough.

23:23.999 --> 23:25.999
- It's scary when you,
like, get all that,

23:25.999 --> 23:26.999
because then it's like,

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
"Is it too late?"
'Cause sometimes it is too late.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
- I'm actually impressed.

23:30.999 --> 23:33.000
Kristen is trying
to right her wrongs,

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
and I think there is something
to say about that.

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
- Where is Ariana bartending?

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
- Garden bar.

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
- I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

23:40.999 --> 23:44.999
- Well, good luck.

23:44.999 --> 23:46.999
You're going to need it.

23:52.999 --> 23:53.999
- Hi.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
- What's up?
- Can I grab a drink from you?

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
- I don't really feel
comfortable serving you alcohol,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.999
to be honest.

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
- I know.
I'm sure.

24:01.999 --> 24:05.999
So I am very well-aware
that you're probably not going

24:05.999 --> 24:08.999
to necessarily be receptive
to this, and that's okay,

24:08.999 --> 24:13.999
but I just want to apologize
for the way that I acted.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
With everything that went down.

24:15.999 --> 24:18.999
I'm not apologizing
for being angry or being upset,

24:18.999 --> 24:19.999
but I didn't need to have

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
these full-on f***ing
immature meltdowns

24:21.999 --> 24:24.999
and saying mean things to you.

24:24.999 --> 24:25.999
I was very selfish then.

24:25.999 --> 24:26.999
You know what I mean?
Like, I wasn't--

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
- That doesn't really
excuse any of it.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.999
- I mean, I just
want to apologize.

24:33.999 --> 24:36.999
I know you were upset
about the Mack Truck comment,

24:36.999 --> 24:38.999
which to me was--
I'm just making a joke.

24:38.999 --> 24:39.999
- And the wanting me to get hit
by a plane

24:39.999 --> 24:42.999
or a train or a bus or--

24:42.999 --> 24:43.999
- Anything that I said.

24:43.999 --> 24:45.999
It just was very,
very immature, and--

24:45.999 --> 24:50.999
- It was a lot f***ing immature.

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
- I know actions
speak louder than words,

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999
and my word is
shot to hell,

24:54.999 --> 24:56.999
because my reputation
is not great,

24:56.999 --> 25:00.999
but it's kind of,
like, all I can do.

25:02.999 --> 25:04.999
I'm not trying
to be your friend.

25:04.999 --> 25:05.999
I'm not trying
to be Tom's friend.

25:05.999 --> 25:06.999
I don't think
that's appropriate.

25:06.999 --> 25:08.999
- No, I mean,
my friends are

25:08.999 --> 25:14.000
very intelligent,
funny, wonderful people,

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
and I've never seen
you be any of those things.

25:19.999 --> 25:21.999
- You don't need
to throw insults,

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
as we're having
an adult conversation,

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
but if that makes you feel
better, that's fine.

25:24.999 --> 25:27.999
- Okay, nd if apologizing to me
makes you feel better,

25:27.999 --> 25:30.999
and makes you feel like you've
cleared your conscience,

25:30.999 --> 25:33.999
then that's great.
Godspeed to you.

25:33.999 --> 25:34.999
Whatever you do in life,

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
whether you're frolicking
through a meadow

25:36.999 --> 25:39.999
or taking a sh**
in the street--

25:39.999 --> 25:40.999
I don't give a f***.

25:40.999 --> 25:43.999
Just stay away from me.

25:43.999 --> 25:44.999
I don't trust your motives.

25:44.999 --> 25:47.000
I don't trust
who you are as a person. I--

25:47.999 --> 25:48.999
- You don't have to.

25:48.999 --> 25:50.999
- But you can do
whatever you want.

25:50.999 --> 25:53.999
Just do it away from me.

25:57.999 --> 25:58.999
- I just want to apologize, so--

25:58.999 --> 26:00.999
- Great.
Good for you.

26:00.999 --> 26:01.999
- Take care.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
- Bitch, you thought--

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
She's so full of sh**.

26:07.999 --> 26:08.999
I don't know how anybody

26:08.999 --> 26:10.999
could ever believe the words
that come out of her mouth.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
She's not that smart,

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
but she's definitely
f***ing calculated.

26:18.999 --> 26:21.999
- Well, that went
as well as you expected it.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
- Coming up.

26:23.999 --> 26:24.999
- For me, I would like
for Kristen to come.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.999
- But she still is a liability.
You can't deny that.

26:26.999 --> 26:28.999
- I know,
but I'm not denying that.

26:28.999 --> 26:30.999
But it kind of reminds me
a little bit

26:30.999 --> 26:32.999
of what was going on
with Stassi.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.999
- ♪ You keep telling me
that your heart is true ♪

26:41.999 --> 26:44.999
♪ I'm just so hesitant
at starting something new ♪

26:44.999 --> 26:46.999
♪ I feel so close to you ♪

26:46.999 --> 26:49.999
- Headshots retouched,
so that's good.

26:49.999 --> 26:50.999
Just wheeling and dealing.

26:50.999 --> 26:52.999
- I need to get new headshots,
actually.

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
- So, this is so cool,
being here with you guys.

26:54.999 --> 26:57.999
- I wish you were here, like,
when we weren't busy,

26:57.999 --> 26:58.999
so we could, like,
go and do--

26:58.999 --> 27:00.999
- Do more stuff.
- Yeah.

27:00.999 --> 27:01.999
- Yeah, yeah.
- Like, maybe some, like,

27:01.999 --> 27:03.999
touristy but fun stuff.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.999
- I can come out
lots of times.

27:05.999 --> 27:06.999
I will be too.

27:06.999 --> 27:10.999
- Ariana actually reminds me
of my mom in some ways.

27:10.999 --> 27:12.999
I just feel like
they're both real, straight up,

27:12.999 --> 27:14.999
no bullsh** individuals.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.999
I wish you were going to be able
to stay for the improv thing.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
- So my friend Lindsay--I've
known her for years and years.

27:19.999 --> 27:22.000
She's been doing
this "My Diary" show.

27:22.999 --> 27:24.000
You're onstage,
and you're going through,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.999
like, these old,
embarrassing diary entries.

27:26.999 --> 27:29.999
Stop!

27:29.999 --> 27:31.000
- Well, this is a diary show.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.999
Is it going to be weird
if I read, like, song lyrics?

27:33.999 --> 27:34.999
Like, I don't even know--
- Dude, no. look.

27:34.999 --> 27:35.999
- I've never done
anything like this.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
- Look, look, look.
- This one's pretty bad.

27:37.999 --> 27:39.999
- "Taking in your smell?"
- Dude, this song...

27:39.999 --> 27:40.999
- No!

27:41.000 --> 27:42.999
- I would love to see it.

27:42.999 --> 27:44.999
- We'll take some video, yeah.
We'll take some video.

27:44.999 --> 27:45.999
I'm doing the show

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
because I definitely
have aspirations for acting.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.999
I think I'm sweating already,
thinking about it.

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
There's that thought in L.A.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.999
It's like you can get up
on stage somewhere.

27:53.999 --> 27:56.999
It might be that casting
director or that talent agent

27:56.999 --> 27:58.999
that's in the crowd that can
launch you to superstardom.

27:58.999 --> 28:01.999
- So, she asked us for, like,
a photo to use

28:01.999 --> 28:03.999
from the period of time
that our things are from.

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
- Oh, my God.

28:04.999 --> 28:07.999
- This is from my 22nd
birthday party.

28:07.999 --> 28:09.999
- You look like one
of the Bradys.

28:09.999 --> 28:12.999
- My very first runway show,
Fashion Week Miami,

28:13.000 --> 28:16.999
was a men's lingerie show.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.000
- So underwear?

28:18.999 --> 28:19.999
- They called it
a men's lingerie show,

28:19.999 --> 28:22.999
so our thing is we have to walk
to the end of the runway,

28:22.999 --> 28:24.999
and take our shirt off,

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
and throw it.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
And oh, by the way, the back
of these underwear were sheer,

28:28.999 --> 28:30.999
so you could see my butt crack.

28:30.999 --> 28:32.999
- Speaking of butt,
are you going to show me

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
this infamous tattoo?

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
- Uh--
- Come on, Tom.

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
Let me see the stupid ass.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
- It's amazing actually.

28:38.999 --> 28:39.999
- Is it?
- Yeah.

28:39.999 --> 28:40.999
The world's not ready for it.

28:40.999 --> 28:43.999
- All right.
Let's see this.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.999
No way.

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
Are you kidding me?

28:47.999 --> 28:48.999
Thomas. Oh, my God.

28:48.999 --> 28:51.999
- I hate it.
I absolutely hate it.

28:51.999 --> 28:53.999
- Poor Tom.
We're picking on Tom, aren't we?

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
- I know.
We are.

28:54.999 --> 28:58.999
- Makes me feel really good
to see you guys together.

28:58.999 --> 29:00.999
I mean, it's like Tom
found the right girl.

29:00.999 --> 29:03.999
- When I was with Kristen,
it was--

29:03.999 --> 29:06.999
I felt like,
yeah, she was my girlfriend,

29:06.999 --> 29:10.999
but she was also, like,
my number one, like, hater.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.999
She, like,
drank that f***ing hatorade

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
and would hate on me
all the time.

29:14.999 --> 29:15.999
- She came up to me
and gave me

29:15.999 --> 29:20.999
some sort
of half-assed apology

29:20.999 --> 29:22.999
about how she wants
to take respon--

29:22.999 --> 29:24.999
as she's telling me
it's time for her--

29:24.999 --> 29:25.999
that she's taking
responsibility...

29:25.999 --> 29:27.999
- Yeah?
- She's, in that moment,

29:27.999 --> 29:29.999
not taking responsibility.

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
- I think you've been
really good

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
about taking the high road.
I mean, I--

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
- It gets really frustrating
though,

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
because doing that
for so long,

29:37.999 --> 29:41.999
and then having friends of mine
act like I'm being petty--

29:43.999 --> 29:45.999
I don't know. It's annoying.

29:45.999 --> 29:46.999
- Yeah.

29:57.999 --> 29:58.999
- Hey, guys.

29:58.999 --> 30:00.999
Hey, what's happening?
Hey, guys.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.000
- Hi.
- How's it going? I'm Tom.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.999
With the modeling thing,
I work consistently,

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
and I really f***ing
like doing it.

30:06.999 --> 30:09.999
Just so much better
than bartending.

30:09.999 --> 30:10.999
So much better.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.999
- This is for our website,
"Labeling Men."

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
- Cool.
- So the storyline

30:15.999 --> 30:18.999
for this is--the best way
to describe it would be

30:18.999 --> 30:22.999
a gentleman in the streets
and a freak in the sheets.

30:22.999 --> 30:23.999
- That's me.

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
- So, I don't know
how comfortable you are

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
with your body, 'cause
we're definitely going to

30:27.999 --> 30:30.999
need some on top showing.

30:30.999 --> 30:32.999
- I'm very comfortable with it,
but the thing is,

30:32.999 --> 30:35.999
aesthetically, it's just
I'm not in the best shape.

30:35.999 --> 30:37.000
- I think we can work
with that.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.999
- You can maybe, like,
airbrush some abs on there.

30:42.999 --> 30:44.999
If you are a model
in Los Angeles,

30:44.999 --> 30:47.999
and you do a job,
they just sort of assume

30:47.999 --> 30:49.999
that you have abdominal muscles,
so when I take off my shirt

30:49.999 --> 30:52.999
and I reveal
my little poochie dad bod,

30:52.999 --> 30:54.000
it's kind of sad.

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
- I put a little toilet paper in
there so they don't get sweaty.

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
- Those are $8,000.

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
Don't get ball sweat
on those shorts.

31:05.999 --> 31:06.999
- That's what I'm saying.

31:06.999 --> 31:07.999
- Give me, like, straight on.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.999
Yeah, that looks good.

31:12.999 --> 31:13.999
That's awesome.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
- That looks good.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
- It--this is really perfect.
- It's really cool.

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
- It's kind of insane.
- Yeah.

31:22.999 --> 31:23.999
You're really good at jumping.

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
That's perfect.
Stay there.

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
Look straight ahead, though,
again.

31:27.999 --> 31:28.999
- Yeah. Love that.
- All right.

31:28.999 --> 31:30.999
- Let's do a lunch break.
- Let's take a break.

31:30.999 --> 31:31.999
- I wouldn't mind, you know,

31:31.999 --> 31:34.999
taking home some of these lace
underwear for the lady.

31:34.999 --> 31:35.999
- You have mascara on.

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
- I like it.
- No.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
- A little bit.
- Don't say it please.

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
- I feel like a rock star.

31:39.999 --> 31:40.999
- I know,
but you're not a rock star.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
You can't wear mascara
and have a dad bod.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.000
- I know.
- Have you spoke much

31:45.999 --> 31:48.999
to Tom and Jax
about their birthday plans?

31:48.999 --> 31:50.999
- No, no, I mean,
we just started going over

31:50.999 --> 31:52.999
the logistics,
but they're going back and forth

31:52.999 --> 31:53.999
about who to invite.

31:53.999 --> 31:54.999
- I would like for Kristen
to come.

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
We've been getting along,
and, you know--

31:56.999 --> 31:57.999
- She still is a liability.
You can't deny that.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
- I know,
but I'm not denying that,

31:59.999 --> 32:02.999
but I don't think
it needs to still be this thing

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
where, you know, Ariana gets,
like--

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
- She can't have meltdowns
when they're in the same room.

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
- Her blood boils, so it's not,
like, totally inappropriate

32:08.999 --> 32:09.999
for them to be
in a group setting.

32:09.999 --> 32:10.999
- Yeah, yeah.
- I hate to say it,

32:10.999 --> 32:13.999
but it kind of reminds me,
a little bit,

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
of what was going on
with Stassi.

32:15.999 --> 32:16.999
Tom and Ariana
are putting themselves

32:17.000 --> 32:19.999
in a little bit of that Stassi
danger zone,

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
where they're isolating
themselves from the group

32:22.000 --> 32:23.999
because of their hatred
for one person.

32:23.999 --> 32:26.999
Kristen's trying
to right her wrongs right now,

32:26.999 --> 32:29.999
and I'm going
to give her the chance to,

32:29.999 --> 32:32.999
you know, prove herself.

32:32.999 --> 32:33.999
- Coming up.

32:33.999 --> 32:34.999
- You got to stop, like,
walking in looking all good.

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
- You're a very dangerous girl
to be around.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
Very, very dangerous.
- Hello, babe.

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
- Hey.

32:51.999 --> 32:54.999
♪ All I want to do
is hold you close ♪

32:55.000 --> 32:57.999
♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
whoa-oh-oh ♪

32:57.999 --> 33:00.999
Hey.

33:00.999 --> 33:01.999
- Nervous?
- Yes.

33:01.999 --> 33:02.999
- Excited?

33:02.999 --> 33:04.999
- f*** yeah I'm nervous.
How are you doing?

33:04.999 --> 33:06.000
- Good, good.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.999
You guys feel
like you're going to puke?

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
You're going to poop?
What are you going to do?

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
- Yeah.
It might be, like, puke-poop.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
- You're going to crush it.

33:13.999 --> 33:16.999
- This book has so much
lyrical gold.

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
I feel like this'll be found,
like the Dead Sea Scrolls,

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
and be transcribed
by people

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
for hundreds of thousands
of years.

33:25.999 --> 33:27.999
- Should be fun.
- Yeah.

33:27.999 --> 33:29.999
Oh, sh**.
Let's sit here.

33:29.999 --> 33:31.999
- This should be interesting.
- Yeah. I know.

33:31.999 --> 33:32.999
- When's Brittany getting in?

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
- She's on her way right now.
- Really?

33:34.999 --> 33:35.999
So she's, like,
driving right now?

33:35.999 --> 33:36.999
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

33:36.999 --> 33:37.999
I'm so excited!

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
- I'm hungry.

33:39.999 --> 33:42.999
- I'm not really sure
what to expect from Sandoval.

33:42.999 --> 33:44.999
He doesn't strike me
as the most comedic person.

33:44.999 --> 33:45.999
He's more dramatic.

33:45.999 --> 33:46.999
- Hello.

33:46.999 --> 33:49.999
- I'm sure he has some funny

33:49.999 --> 33:50.999
deep down inside of him.

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, bubbys.

33:52.999 --> 33:54.999
- Should we heckle?
- Yes. Yes.

33:54.999 --> 33:57.999
- You're always worried
that, oh,

33:57.999 --> 33:58.999
that your friends
are going to bomb.

33:58.999 --> 33:59.999
And there's nothing worse

33:59.999 --> 34:01.999
than seeing your friends bomb
onstage.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.999
- What's up, everybody?

34:03.999 --> 34:05.999
Welcome to "My Diary."

34:05.999 --> 34:07.999
I'm your host, Lindsay Ames.

34:07.999 --> 34:09.999
So, you know, diary's
a really important part

34:09.999 --> 34:10.999
of all of our lives.

34:10.999 --> 34:12.999
A lot of people have diaries.

34:12.999 --> 34:16.999
Welcome to the show that makes
you thank God you burned yours.

34:16.999 --> 34:19.999
- Well, when I was 19, I was
the worst at keeping diaries.

34:19.999 --> 34:20.999
I'd be like this,

34:20.999 --> 34:23.999
"Dear diary,
today I had a bagel sandwich."

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
- These are my
at-work pet peeves.

34:27.999 --> 34:28.999
"It's irritating enough to have
to wait in line

34:28.999 --> 34:30.999
"to use the microwave,
but when I see someone

34:30.999 --> 34:32.999
"walk away with their food
in the microwave

34:32.999 --> 34:34.999
"it makes me want to stab
their f***ing French bread pizza

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
and throw it on the floor."

34:36.999 --> 34:39.999
- "I gave him another hand job,

34:39.999 --> 34:42.999
and it's really not that bad."

34:42.999 --> 34:44.999
- I've never been to a show

34:44.999 --> 34:46.999
where you're getting up
and reading out of a journal.

34:46.999 --> 34:49.999
- You're going
to f***ing love me, okay.

34:49.999 --> 34:51.999
- If that's
what a comedian is,

34:51.999 --> 34:53.999
then I guess
I can be a comedian too.

34:53.999 --> 34:58.999
- Please put your hands
together for Ariana Madix.

34:58.999 --> 35:03.999
- I feel a little rusty getting
onstage as a live actress,

35:03.999 --> 35:08.999
so hopefully people think
my diary is just that pathetic.

35:08.999 --> 35:10.999
"Dear journal,

35:10.999 --> 35:13.999
"for the longest time, I didn't
know what I should write.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
"The first entry is
so important,

35:15.999 --> 35:20.999
"and in case this becomes
a movie someday,

35:20.999 --> 35:26.999
I didn't want
what I wrote to sound stupid."

35:26.999 --> 35:29.999
- I didn't know
that was supposed to be funny.

35:29.999 --> 35:32.999
- "Jenny--she
seems really athletic.

35:32.999 --> 35:36.999
"I think she may be a lesbian.

35:36.999 --> 35:38.999
"Jessica--
she's my R.A. upstairs.

35:38.999 --> 35:42.999
She's really loud.
Lesbian."

35:42.999 --> 35:44.999
- I know Ariana,
but what I'm learning,

35:44.999 --> 35:46.999
and I never realized before,

35:46.999 --> 35:50.000
is that she thinks
everyone's a lesbian.

35:50.999 --> 35:52.999
- "There are wiccans
on my floor that scare me,

35:52.999 --> 35:54.999
"and there are
so many lesbians.

35:54.999 --> 35:57.999
Ahh!"

35:57.999 --> 35:59.999
So that's that for me.

35:59.999 --> 36:02.999
- Give it up for Ariana.
Whoo!

36:02.999 --> 36:05.999
- It feels really good
to be onstage again.

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
I think people thought I
was funnier than I thought

36:07.999 --> 36:08.999
that they were going to think.

36:08.999 --> 36:12.999
- Please put your hands together
for Tom Sandoval.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.999
- Whoo!

36:21.999 --> 36:23.999
- Really?
That picture?

36:23.999 --> 36:26.999
I've never actually written
in a diary before,

36:26.999 --> 36:29.999
but I have a diary here
that my friend got me

36:29.999 --> 36:32.999
for all my amazing lyrics

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
that I have written
over the years.

36:34.999 --> 36:38.999
I mean these are
some major gems.

36:38.999 --> 36:41.999
Some political sh**, yo.

36:41.999 --> 36:42.999
All right.
Here we go.

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
♪ You give me fear
but no truth and-- ♪

36:44.999 --> 36:48.999
Wait. No, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
♪ You give me fear
but no proof ♪

36:50.999 --> 36:51.999
♪ And then you
twist the truth ♪

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
♪ So you just
send in your troops ♪

36:53.999 --> 36:54.999
♪ And now your stock's
at the roof ♪

36:54.999 --> 36:57.999
♪ Solid borders are new
but you can get right through ♪

36:57.999 --> 37:00.999
♪ If we make a soldier of you
that we can easily lose ♪

37:00.999 --> 37:03.999
This is where it gets
really good.

37:03.999 --> 37:08.999
♪ Exploding car
like an exploding heart ♪

37:08.999 --> 37:14.999
♪ Guided missiles are smart
but some presidents aren't ♪

37:14.999 --> 37:20.999
♪ It's one world, but we just
have to exist apart ♪

37:20.999 --> 37:24.999
One war anxious
for another to start.

37:24.999 --> 37:26.999
Uh.

37:28.999 --> 37:29.999
Now for my grand finale.

37:29.999 --> 37:32.000
The moment no one
has been waiting for.

37:32.999 --> 37:35.999
I got one of the worst tattoos
in history,

37:35.999 --> 37:38.999
thinking it would be
an amazing idea.

37:38.999 --> 37:42.999
It's actually real.
Drink it up, folks.

37:42.999 --> 37:45.999
- Tom, Tom, put your butt away.

37:45.999 --> 37:48.999
Tom, the bacon A
is for our private shame.

37:48.999 --> 37:49.999
Not for the world to see.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.999
- Whatever you feel, girl.
- Hi!

37:52.999 --> 37:55.999
- Hi!
- You were so funny.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
- Oh, glad you liked it.

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
- He wants one too.
- No, no, no.

37:58.999 --> 38:00.999
- Dude, I was so nervous.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.999
- Listen,
tomorrow night,

38:02.999 --> 38:03.999
Scheana and I are going
to go have drinks.

38:03.999 --> 38:05.999
- I'ma let you guys talk.
Be right back.

38:05.999 --> 38:07.999
- Do you want to come
have drinks with us?

38:07.999 --> 38:09.999
- Yeah. I do want to come
have drinks with you.

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
- It's a drink.
Harmless.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.999
- You got to stop, like,
walking in looking all good.

38:13.999 --> 38:15.999
It makes it really hard
for somebody like me.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.999
- Stop. You're such a t--

38:17.999 --> 38:20.000
you're a very dangerous girl
to be around.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.000
- Yeah.
- You're very, very dangerous.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.999
- Hi.
- Hello, babe. How are you?

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
- You want another drink?
- Yes.

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
- Give me a kiss.

38:33.999 --> 38:34.999
I'm gonna grab you a drink,
all right?

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
There's no competition
when it comes to me and Jax,

38:36.999 --> 38:40.999
primarily because I'm better
than him in everything in life.

38:40.999 --> 38:42.999
- What is that face?
- Hey, it's your life.

38:42.999 --> 38:44.999
It's your--
you do what you want to do.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.999
- I think I'm
the female version of you.

38:47.999 --> 38:50.000
If, like, you and I
were together, right...

38:50.999 --> 38:51.999
- Mm-hmm?
- Hypothetically,

38:51.999 --> 38:54.999
I feel like we would connect.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
Thank you.
- You're welcome. Cheers.

38:56.999 --> 38:57.999
- Cheers.
One second.

38:57.999 --> 38:58.999
- All right.
- Thanks.

38:58.999 --> 39:00.999
- So, Friday then?

39:00.999 --> 39:01.999
Do you want to come
have drinks with us?

39:01.999 --> 39:02.999
- Yeah, I do.

39:02.999 --> 39:05.999
- Jax, I heard Brittany
was coming back in town today.

39:05.999 --> 39:06.999
- Yeah.
- Not today. Friday.

39:06.999 --> 39:07.999
- Oh, not today.
Friday.

39:07.999 --> 39:08.999
- That's why
we're all going out.

39:08.999 --> 39:11.999
- Oh, cool.

39:11.999 --> 39:12.999
- Wait. Hold on.
Baby--baby girl is coming?

39:12.999 --> 39:14.999
- He's a child.
He's a man who's a child.

39:14.999 --> 39:17.999
- We're not talking about him.
We're talking about--

39:17.999 --> 39:20.999
- Brittany's not coming.

39:20.999 --> 39:22.999
I just--shoo.
It gets him out of the way.

39:22.999 --> 39:24.999
He's a confident guy,
then why does he have to

39:24.999 --> 39:26.999
come and overcompensate?

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
You don't have to kiss you
in front of me. I don't--

39:28.999 --> 39:30.999
- Well, you'll just have
to kiss me in front of him.

39:30.999 --> 39:31.999
- Shoot.
- That's just the way it works,

39:31.999 --> 39:32.999
you know?

39:32.999 --> 39:35.999
Flirting with Jax?
I see no conflict.

39:35.999 --> 39:39.999
I'm sure there are many girls
out there that may think

39:39.999 --> 39:41.999
that he is their boyfriend,

39:41.999 --> 39:43.999
but that's not really
my problem.

39:43.999 --> 39:44.999
- Do you guys want to go back
to my house?

39:44.999 --> 39:45.999
Have a couple beers?

39:45.999 --> 39:46.999
- Sorry.
I'm not trying to be

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
a Debbie Downer,
but I have to go to Sur.

39:48.999 --> 39:49.999
I know you guys
are all so jealous.

39:49.999 --> 39:52.999
You have cheese on your chin.

39:52.999 --> 39:54.999
- All right, guys.

39:54.999 --> 39:55.999
- Thanks for coming.

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
- Wait for me!

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
- Coming up.

39:58.999 --> 40:00.999
- You're trying to act
like I'm a f***ing psycho

40:00.999 --> 40:01.999
because I don't want Kristen

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
to go on a f***ing
birthday trip with me?

40:03.999 --> 40:05.999
Look at you now,
motherf***er.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- I can't get over
the amount of lesbians

40:16.999 --> 40:17.999
that are at your college.

40:17.999 --> 40:18.999
- And Wicca chicks.
- Like I said, I thought

40:18.999 --> 40:20.999
someone was going to
find that journal

40:20.999 --> 40:21.999
and turn it into
a movie.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
- So me and Jax
have talked about

40:23.999 --> 40:28.999
possibly doing
a joint birthday trip.

40:28.999 --> 40:30.999
- The hard part of this whole
thing is the guest list.

40:30.999 --> 40:31.999
I don't want James.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.999
- I'm okay with James coming.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
- Okay, here's the kicker.

40:35.999 --> 40:36.999
The elephant in the room here.

40:36.999 --> 40:39.999
- There was a slight argument
for Kristen.

40:39.999 --> 40:42.999
- I don't even know why we
would even talk about that.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
- Well, it definitely wouldn't
make anybody's trip more fun.

40:44.999 --> 40:46.999
That's for damn sure, so...

40:46.999 --> 40:47.999
- She is a liability.

40:47.999 --> 40:50.999
- She's a f***ing liability.

40:50.999 --> 40:52.999
- But James isn't?
This all makes me nervous.

40:52.999 --> 40:53.999
- Okay.
It makes you nervous?

40:53.999 --> 40:56.999
So does my mother***ing
ex-girlfriend.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
- Okay, and I'm not saying
that she shouldn't.

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
- Dude, I don't understand
why you're even getting mad.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
You're getting angry
for no reason.

41:00.999 --> 41:01.999
- I think
it was a hypothetical 'cause

41:01.999 --> 41:03.999
they figured enough time
had passed.

41:03.999 --> 41:04.999
- You know who gets to decide

41:04.999 --> 41:05.999
how much time
has f***ing passed?

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
- No, no, no.
I wasn't speaking--

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
- Not her, not you, not you.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.999
Not any f***ing person
on this f***ing planet.

41:11.999 --> 41:13.999
Me.

41:13.999 --> 41:14.999
- It's common knowledge
that Kristen

41:15.000 --> 41:17.999
is an emotional
and mental liability.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.999
Why am I being questioned?

41:19.999 --> 41:22.999
If you legitimately think
that, like,

41:22.999 --> 41:25.000
that there is something
wrong with my reasoning

41:25.000 --> 41:27.999
I have to pass immediate
judgment on you--

41:27.999 --> 41:28.999
- Okay, Stassi.
- Hardcore.

41:28.999 --> 41:29.999
- What do you mean,
"Okay, Stassi"?

41:29.999 --> 41:32.999
Am I giving
you ultimatums, Katie?

41:32.999 --> 41:34.999
Are you f***ing kidding me?

41:34.999 --> 41:35.999
- I don't like someone saying

41:35.999 --> 41:36.999
they're going to pass judgment
on me, because I--

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
- No. I have to.
I'm sorry.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
- Then I pass judgment on people
that can't get over sh**.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.999
- Do people have amnesia?

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
Did they drink
some strange Kool-Aid?

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
Are you trying to act
like I'm an ass****

41:45.999 --> 41:48.999
because I am having a birthday,
and I don't want to invite her?

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
- You guys, we mentioned--
- Then why are you even

41:50.999 --> 41:51.999
bringing it up?

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
- No, no, no.
- You guys, all we did

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
was bring up the name, and,
like, look at this reaction.

41:56.999 --> 41:57.999
- You didn't bring up the name.

41:57.999 --> 41:59.999
Kristen doesn't have that power
over me anymore.

41:59.999 --> 42:01.999
- I wanted
to have a conversation,

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
but if you're going
to scream your f***ing head off

42:03.999 --> 42:05.999
to me, well, then you've
already lost the argument.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
- But you suggesting--

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
- Oh, my God, Katie.
Shut up about "look at you now"!

42:09.999 --> 42:11.999
- Look at you now.
- Stop!

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
- Like, you guys, seriously.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.999
- You're trying to act like
I'm a f***ing psycho because

42:16.999 --> 42:19.999
I don't want Kristen to go on
a f***ing birthday trip with me,

42:19.999 --> 42:21.999
and that I'm actually pissed off
that you would suggest that?

42:21.999 --> 42:23.999
Look at you now, motherf***er.
Don't--

42:23.999 --> 42:25.999
- Stop doing that.
Stop doing that.

42:25.999 --> 42:26.999
- Do not f***ing
compare me to Stassi.

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
- Because you guys are acting
like children about it.

42:28.999 --> 42:31.999
- It takes so much more energy
to hold a grudge,

42:31.999 --> 42:32.999
so Tom and Ariana
should just let her go.

42:32.999 --> 42:34.999
- Look at the way you guys
are f***ing acting right now.

42:34.999 --> 42:35.999
It's f***ing insane.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:41.999 --> 42:43.999
- Hi, babies.
- Hi.

42:43.999 --> 42:44.999
- Can we f***
and not tell anybody?

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
- This is why you shouldn't
have a girlfriend.

42:46.999 --> 42:47.999
- I made it!
- You made it.

42:47.999 --> 42:49.999
- You moved in with this one
already, yeah?

42:49.999 --> 42:51.999
- Yep.
Dun dun dun.

42:51.999 --> 42:53.999
- I text Jax at, like,
00 in the morning,

42:53.999 --> 42:55.999
and it just says,
"Come get in my bed."

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
- I think I've finally
done something right.

42:57.999 --> 43:00.999
- Really?

43:00.999 --> 43:01.999
- Get that ring on her finger,

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
and walk her down the aisle
as soon as possible.

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
- Yeah, yeah.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
All right, I got the ring.
Orchestrated it.

43:06.999 --> 43:08.999
I can feel my heart rate.

43:08.999 --> 43:10.999
f***, f***, f***.
Don't f*** this up, man.

43:10.999 --> 43:13.999
Ugh.
I can't breathe.

43:13.999 --> 43:14.999
- To see more of
"Vanderpump Rules,"

43:14.999 --> 43:16.000
