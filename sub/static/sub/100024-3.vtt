in a course in some dusty college hall,

12:12.534 --> 12:15.866
or did her ancestors wash 'round
the other side of the Andes

12:15.867 --> 12:17.700
and take up the war against the Spanish

12:17.701 --> 12:19.099

12:46.234 --> 12:48.633

thought it an easy "A"?

12:50.967 --> 12:53.600

at times comes easy to me,

12:53.601 --> 12:55.400
I used that as my start,

12:55.401 --> 12:57.266
which led me to the Galvin family,

12:57.267 --> 12:59.533
the family that started
this school back in, um...

12:59.534 --> 13:02.700
back in...

13:02.701 --> 13:07.033

13:07.034 --> 13:08.666
There weren't any other
places for them to learn,

13:08.667 --> 13:11.333

so popular wasn't the...

13:23.001 --> 13:24.700

13:24.701 --> 13:26.966
I- I-I mean, most of the
people around were...

13:26.967 --> 13:28.400
were day laborers and farmhands

13:28.401 --> 13:30.200
in the strawberry and melon patches.

13:30.201 --> 13:33.700
But the school had a
choir that would sing.

17:32.534 --> 17:35.265
Seren, go and wait for me outside.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.732
Don't go or speak to anyone.

17:49.367 --> 17:52.233
Wow.

17:52.234 --> 17:55.166
Why would you use that language?

17:55.167 --> 17:58.333
- Dr. Woods says you're...
- Woods-Trap.

17:58.334 --> 18:00.966
Excuse me?

18:00.967 --> 18:04.300
Do you know we can have you
removed from this school?

18:04.301 --> 18:07.800
You decided to fight during
your only gifted class...

18:07.801 --> 18:09.366
the reason you're in a Magnet school.

18:09.367 --> 18:11.633
- I didn't hit him.
- You provoked.

18:11.634 --> 18:12.866
I told him the truth.

18:12.867 --> 18:16.200
You called him a racial slur.

18:16.201 --> 18:19.033
I'm black. He wants to be.

18:19.034 --> 18:20.566
That ain't racist.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.966
Dr. Woods-Trap says

18:21.967 --> 18:24.800
you are interested in Hurston Prep.

18:24.801 --> 18:26.165
Is that right?

18:27.901 --> 18:29.699
I asked you a question.

18:31.001 --> 18:33.066
Yes, ma'am.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.000
If they saw the word "altercation"

18:35.001 --> 18:38.033
on your school records...
whether you punched or provoked,

18:38.034 --> 18:39.733
if they saw it,

18:39.734 --> 18:43.266
they wouldn't even look
at your application.

18:43.267 --> 18:44.866
Do you understand?

18:44.867 --> 18:46.233
Yes, ma'am.

18:46.234 --> 18:48.074
Now, get your mom on the phone.

18:50.234 --> 18:51.766
I can't.

18:51.767 --> 18:54.366
Why not?

18:54.367 --> 18:55.900
The... the phone's off.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.165
She doesn't have a phone or even a cell?

19:00.934 --> 19:02.665
How long?

19:07.067 --> 19:08.699
Since the lights came back on.

19:11.334 --> 19:12.665
You don't have lights?

19:13.501 --> 19:15.666
They're back on now.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.399
When... wait.

19:20.401 --> 19:23.166
David, did you have
breakfast this morning?

20:42.534 --> 20:44.755
Seren, your parents.

20:49.701 --> 20:51.499
I cannot believe you two.

20:54.201 --> 20:56.699
Wait till your stepdaddy
hears about this.

21:01.501 --> 21:04.533
David is... it's a gifted class.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.433
Everyone else in the class
does not look like him,

21:06.434 --> 21:08.000
and it's happened before
where I have caught him

21:08.001 --> 21:10.466
making comments about
light skin this, Rican that.

21:10.467 --> 21:11.766
That's my point. Please, may I...

21:11.767 --> 21:13.499
It seems like...

21:16.034 --> 21:19.466
In all of David's other classes,
the ones that aren't gifted,

21:19.467 --> 21:22.633
he's surrounded by
people who look like him.

21:22.634 --> 21:24.100
But in my class, it's different.

21:24.101 --> 21:25.200
He's the only one...

21:25.201 --> 21:26.766
Seren is black.

21:26.767 --> 21:30.465
...The only one who looks like him.

21:31.934 --> 21:34.133
Oh, surely, you don't
want me to diagram colorism

21:34.134 --> 21:36.300
just now, Principal.

21:36.301 --> 21:40.566
He looks around and it cues
him that he's the only one.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.933
And he tries to excel.
He tries to be the best.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.700
And he tries to prove that
he deserves to be there,

21:46.701 --> 21:49.399
and I think this time, it
just got the better of him.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.387
I'd like him to see the counselor.

21:55.467 --> 21:56.633
Okay.

21:56.634 --> 21:59.423
But...

21:59.424 --> 22:00.512
Thank you.

22:00.513 --> 22:02.602
You're not the mother.

22:02.603 --> 22:05.400
He needs his mother to
sign off for him to do that.

22:05.401 --> 22:08.133
Well, I didn't say...

22:08.134 --> 22:09.166
Okay.

22:09.167 --> 22:11.900
I have real concerns here.

22:11.901 --> 22:15.100
He just told me they didn't
have lights in the home

22:15.101 --> 22:16.333
and the phone is out of service,

22:16.334 --> 22:19.233
and I'm not sure he's even eating.

22:19.234 --> 22:21.466
I think we need to see if this student

22:21.467 --> 22:25.500
is acting out because of home.

22:25.501 --> 22:26.966
He told you this?

22:26.967 --> 22:28.699
Mm-hmm.

22:31.567 --> 22:33.500
I'll talk to Dr. Bree.

22:33.501 --> 22:35.366
But I need his mother's signature

22:35.367 --> 22:38.566
or it's in-school suspension.

23:52.967 --> 23:55.432
Get your black ass on, now.

24:13.634 --> 24:15.365
Man of war!

24:25.667 --> 24:27.632
Go on, boy. We can't speak?

24:31.567 --> 24:34.000
Af... afternoon.

24:34.001 --> 24:37.100
Vespers.

24:37.101 --> 24:40.100
Woods-Trap taught y'all that?

24:40.101 --> 24:41.533
What's vespers?

24:41.534 --> 24:43.166
It's, um...

24:43.167 --> 24:44.766
It's... Blessed by the name.

24:44.767 --> 24:46.933
Oh, shit.

24:46.934 --> 24:48.900
Come on, G.

24:48.901 --> 24:51.700
Let me know more.

24:51.701 --> 24:55.033
Vespers comes from Latin "vesperis".

24:55.034 --> 24:56.300
All love. Meaning...

24:56.301 --> 24:57.732
- Meaning...
- Meaning...

24:59.834 --> 25:02.233
Evenin' song.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.400
Look, why ain't you let me finish?

25:03.401 --> 25:04.832
You wasn't ready.

25:06.934 --> 25:10.366
You come up in here lettin'
that cat distract you.

25:10.367 --> 25:12.099
Pussy will get you stuck.

25:16.934 --> 25:19.333
What happened?

25:19.334 --> 25:20.866
Uh, I'm tired.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.933
Weary, look like.

25:22.934 --> 25:25.533
How'd it go with the assignment?

25:25.534 --> 25:26.866
I'm tryin' to go home.

25:26.867 --> 25:29.433
Oh, yeah?

25:29.434 --> 25:30.632
This home?

25:33.034 --> 25:35.666
Sky, you know what I meant... temporary.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.700
Watch your words about
the Vil, young sir.

25:38.701 --> 25:41.466
This line... it ain't
here to protect you.

25:41.467 --> 25:45.266
It's to protect them
from these projects.

25:47.501 --> 25:51.633
- S-Sky.
- Ready to walk past here?

25:51.634 --> 25:53.500
I mean, if you stay ready,
you ain't got to get...

25:53.501 --> 25:54.600
Get ready!

25:54.601 --> 25:56.065
Right. I get it.

25:57.367 --> 25:58.700
How'd it go?

25:58.701 --> 26:00.433
- I didn't go.
- What?

26:00.434 --> 26:02.233
- I told you to go first!
- I know.

26:02.234 --> 26:03.766
Look, I gotta go.

26:03.767 --> 26:05.600
What happened at the schoolhouse?

26:05.601 --> 26:08.033
You supposed to try to impress Dr. W-T.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.900
She could make you a prep-school man.

26:09.901 --> 26:10.933
- No.
- No?

26:10.934 --> 26:12.133
No!

26:12.134 --> 26:14.233
You know!

26:14.234 --> 26:15.965
Dave!

26:25.467 --> 26:27.066
Ugh!

26:32.157 --> 26:33.246
- No!
- Come on, JG!

26:33.247 --> 26:34.302
- Let go!
- Step back!

26:34.303 --> 26:35.566
Aw, Dave!

26:35.567 --> 26:38.066
JG was just about to get loose on him.

26:38.067 --> 26:39.266
Why you stoppin' shit, Dave?

26:39.267 --> 26:40.700
This your brother, Shinobi?

26:40.701 --> 26:42.233
Where yours at? You
lookin' out for yours?

26:42.234 --> 26:43.400
Watch your mouth, nigga.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.233
Nah, nah, nah, don't tell him nothin'!

26:45.234 --> 26:46.500
Keep talkin' shit!

26:46.501 --> 26:47.966
I struck yo ass, nigga.

26:47.967 --> 26:49.200
What?

26:49.201 --> 26:50.466
Yo, you heard me.

26:50.467 --> 26:52.200
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey! You did, my nigga.

26:52.201 --> 26:55.766
Nobody can't understand what
the fuck you're sayin', bro.

26:55.767 --> 26:58.533
A'ight, y'all. Show's over, y'all.

26:58.534 --> 27:01.266
Disperse. Get the hell on.

27:05.334 --> 27:09.166
Say, brother Dave. We
got a situation here.

27:09.167 --> 27:11.733
Think you can help me?

27:11.734 --> 27:13.866
We need a lookout for tonight...

27:13.867 --> 27:15.933
On the backs without eyes.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.300
We asked, uh, Willie
Derrick here if he'd do it.

27:18.301 --> 27:19.566
He was more than happy to.

27:19.567 --> 27:22.166
In fact, little nigga
decided to run his mouth

27:22.167 --> 27:24.766
all over elementary that he
was lookout for the Vil tonight.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.566
Nah, nah, Raynan, that's
not how it happened.

27:26.567 --> 27:28.133
JG was the one snitchin'.

27:28.134 --> 27:29.400
I oughta drop yo ass again!

27:29.401 --> 27:31.500
Keep puttin' my name
with snitch, I'm gonna.

27:31.501 --> 27:32.900
I'm sayin' who told them!

27:32.901 --> 27:35.600
I told your broke ass that
you nothin' but a po-po.

27:35.601 --> 27:37.500
Runnin' trump is in my blood.

27:37.501 --> 27:39.566
And this nigga right here is my blood.

27:39.567 --> 27:42.100
He's gonna be a boss.
He was runnin' with Sky.

27:42.101 --> 27:44.366
You got a lot of that fire, man.

27:44.367 --> 27:47.333
Said you was about to
be king of this, Dave.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.833
No disrespect, Raynan,
but my brother misspoke.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.100
I was about nothin', man.

27:51.101 --> 27:52.600
Nah.

27:52.601 --> 27:55.433
Since, uh, Willie Derrick
here just got dusted

27:55.434 --> 27:57.600
in front the whole damn 'jects,
we gonna need somebody else

27:57.601 --> 28:00.600
to be watchboy for us
tonight, you understand?

28:00.601 --> 28:02.000
- Man.
- Go play!

28:02.001 --> 28:07.700
You see what I'm dealin' with, Dave?

28:07.701 --> 28:11.033
We need somebody to take his place.

28:11.034 --> 28:12.966
As you well know,

28:12.967 --> 28:14.400
pay is pretty good for late-hours work

28:14.401 --> 28:16.733
if, uh, you know, JG wanna come through.

28:16.734 --> 28:18.700
Nah, he... he busy.

28:18.701 --> 28:20.466
- Doin' what?
- Being 9!

28:20.467 --> 28:21.700
I hear ya. Hey, hey.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.933
I hear ya.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.166
I'm only askin' as a...

28:25.167 --> 28:27.266
Temporary thing...

28:27.267 --> 28:28.966
While I'm settin' up shop,

28:28.967 --> 28:32.733
until we could find someone else.

28:32.734 --> 28:34.833
I got you. I'll do it.

28:34.834 --> 28:36.766
The fuck you on? You can't.

28:36.767 --> 28:39.233
Not with faggot-ass Miss
Elijah watching y'all.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.866
Nigga, what I say?

28:41.867 --> 28:43.600
It's only for the night, though, man.

28:43.601 --> 28:45.566
JG not in this.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.800
Well done, brother Dave.

28:57.801 --> 28:59.533
Well done.

29:11.134 --> 29:12.300
I asked you to go home, man...

29:12.301 --> 29:13.533
straight home!

29:13.534 --> 29:15.533
Man, Willie Derrick was talking shit.

29:15.534 --> 29:17.133
Jonathan, what if I was late?

29:17.134 --> 29:19.166
What if you had busted
his lip or even the police

29:19.167 --> 29:20.933
that come around and caught you dustin'?

29:20.934 --> 29:22.700
Then what?

29:22.701 --> 29:24.799
Man, Raynan's got your back, though.

29:26.401 --> 29:29.100
Nigga, Raynan ain't with nobody, man.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.566
He may talk like he
runnin' shit for Sky,

29:30.567 --> 29:31.833
but don't believe it, JG.

29:31.834 --> 29:33.400
Hey, you got to learn to look people

29:33.401 --> 29:34.900
in the eyes when they talk.

29:34.901 --> 29:37.300
Stop listenin' to they mouth,
and look in they eyes, man.

29:46.834 --> 29:48.674
Don't say nothin' about tonight.

29:53.001 --> 29:55.233
- Well, hey, hey!
- Hey, mama!

29:55.234 --> 29:57.365
Hey, baby J!

29:58.567 --> 30:01.766
Why you look like that? Oh...

30:01.767 --> 30:03.266
He was dirt diving Willie Derrick

30:03.267 --> 30:05.300
when I walked up on him.

30:05.301 --> 30:07.032
Wash up, JG.

30:11.034 --> 30:13.766
Was he fightin'?

30:13.767 --> 30:16.366
It was me fightin'.

30:16.367 --> 30:17.700
What? Who?

30:17.701 --> 30:19.533
Me and Seren... we got into it.

30:19.534 --> 30:21.566
The principal said she called.

30:21.567 --> 30:22.966
You lyin'?

30:22.967 --> 30:24.566
No, ma'am.

30:24.567 --> 30:25.833
You lyin' to me.

30:25.834 --> 30:27.200
I don't lie to you, ma'am.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.400
Mm.

30:28.401 --> 30:30.401
You just don't tell me everything.

30:32.467 --> 30:34.199
The principal's watching me.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.400
Watchin'? What does that mean?

30:39.834 --> 30:42.166
She say you gotta sign this.

30:42.167 --> 30:45.366
Ma, I got soap in my eyes.

30:45.367 --> 30:47.866
It's washin' dirt. That's
why it hurt, baby.

30:47.867 --> 30:49.765
Just use the water.

31:00.234 --> 31:04.100
This says you need to see the counselor.

31:04.101 --> 31:05.832
David.

31:12.301 --> 31:14.065
What she say?

31:15.267 --> 31:17.099
Why you gotta see the counselor?

31:20.034 --> 31:23.766
Sh-she's worried I'm not...

31:23.767 --> 31:26.099
Getting everything I need.

31:30.934 --> 31:32.665
At home?

31:41.267 --> 31:43.800
I'm clean.

31:43.801 --> 31:45.265
Yes, ma'am.

31:47.334 --> 31:50.533
I don't lie to you.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.265
I- I know that.

31:55.034 --> 31:57.099
Things been better, right?

32:07.055 --> 32:08.310
Why you home?

32:08.311 --> 32:09.933
I got a shift switch so I could come

32:09.934 --> 32:11.166
bring you some food before the next.

32:11.167 --> 32:12.500
This for tonight.

32:12.501 --> 32:15.866
This for after school
tomorrow if I'm not here.

32:15.867 --> 32:18.100
So, what? You not stayin'?

32:18.101 --> 32:21.366
Take that money on the
counter to Miss Elijah.

32:21.367 --> 32:22.766
Please don't lose your mind!

32:22.767 --> 32:24.633
You ain't the only one
had a hard day, David.

32:24.634 --> 32:26.932
And you comin' in here
tellin' me you fightin'.

32:29.467 --> 32:31.500
You like me.

32:31.501 --> 32:32.833
Oh, God.

32:32.834 --> 32:35.333
You so like me.

32:35.334 --> 32:38.300
But you ain't grown enough
to stop social services

32:38.301 --> 32:40.000
from marchin' in here and draggin' you

32:40.001 --> 32:41.633
and Jonath... if they...

32:41.634 --> 32:45.433
I got one more before they...

32:45.434 --> 32:48.933
There are people looking to tell
the office we ain't doin' right.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.500
Remember the summer...

32:50.501 --> 32:51.766
how they were comin' to the house,

32:51.767 --> 32:54.466
how the police wanted to
talk to you... remember?

32:54.467 --> 32:56.066
Yes, ma'am.

32:56.067 --> 32:57.533
I look 'round,

32:57.534 --> 32:59.666
and I'm believin' you tuckin'
your brother in at night,

32:59.667 --> 33:01.166
and you're runnin' these streets

33:01.167 --> 33:03.466
with dope boys, talkin'
'bout Sky watchin' over.

33:03.467 --> 33:05.199
- 'Cause he was.
- David!

33:08.667 --> 33:10.033
I wasn't here, then.

33:10.034 --> 33:11.966
And I'm... I'm...

33:11.967 --> 33:13.200
I'm here now, though.

33:13.201 --> 33:15.900
I'm here now.

33:15.901 --> 33:17.733
If it was up to me, we
wouldn't even be here.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.799
It's not good for any of us.

33:27.934 --> 33:31.133
Old people...

33:31.134 --> 33:33.400
Old places, and old things.

33:33.401 --> 33:35.866
That's right.

33:35.867 --> 33:37.865
Not good for nothin'.

33:40.034 --> 33:41.900
Y'all man.

33:41.901 --> 33:43.056
All man.

33:43.057 --> 33:45.633
Gonna keep workin' these extra
shifts at the truck-stop spot,

33:45.634 --> 33:48.466
and then we gone.

33:48.467 --> 33:50.433
Maybe we move closer to that high school

33:50.434 --> 33:53.132
you keep talkin' about,
yeah? That Hurston.

33:57.134 --> 34:00.933
I gotta go, and...

34:00.934 --> 34:02.466
You gotta go.

34:02.467 --> 34:04.733
Just... just hold on, okay?

34:04.734 --> 34:06.900
Just hold on.

34:06.901 --> 34:09.500
Take this money to Miss Elijah, please?

34:35.473 --> 34:37.170
Now, you know better.

34:38.223 --> 34:39.920
Huh?

34:50.734 --> 34:53.366
Why you beatin' on
the door that way, huh?

34:53.367 --> 34:55.099
Hey, Miss Elijah.

34:57.634 --> 34:59.633
Hey, David.

34:59.634 --> 35:02.366
My mom asked me to bring
you this for watchin' us.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.133
I asked Gloria not to do
that. Did you tell her?

35:05.134 --> 35:07.500
She said she gotta give you somethin'.

35:07.501 --> 35:09.600
What's ailing you?

35:09.601 --> 35:11.666
- I'm good.
- I seen good.

35:11.667 --> 35:14.433
You are not him.

35:14.434 --> 35:15.633
Hmm.

35:15.634 --> 35:17.100
Come out the doorway, dear.

35:17.101 --> 35:18.633
Don't dwell, sir.

35:18.634 --> 35:20.399
It's rude.

35:23.167 --> 35:24.899
Keep that.

35:28.867 --> 35:30.627
What's the matter with you?

35:32.034 --> 35:35.066
I'm gettin' a slip of paper
to write the number down

35:35.067 --> 35:38.133
I need you to play.

35:38.134 --> 35:40.300
The last time I sent
you to play the number,

35:40.301 --> 35:43.966
you forgot and had to come back.

35:43.967 --> 35:46.566
Remember?

35:46.567 --> 35:48.066
Yeah, I just moved

35:48.067 --> 35:50.600
'cause I didn't want to run into you.

35:50.601 --> 35:53.533
Respect is simple.

35:53.534 --> 35:57.166
Your mother sent me money to
thank me for watching y'all,

35:57.167 --> 35:59.800
just like you... will watch the block

35:59.801 --> 36:01.761
for your homies tonight, right?

36:03.767 --> 36:05.233
Oh!

36:05.234 --> 36:06.933
Surprise.

36:23.167 --> 36:26.666
- Ooh, there go Tare's man!
- Mm-hmm.

36:26.667 --> 36:29.866
- You're a magician.
- I bet he had to be.

36:31.334 --> 36:34.032
Who is that talkin' nasty, like that?

36:35.467 --> 36:38.133
Kayla, fall away from here.

36:38.134 --> 36:39.666
I'm not supposed to be seeing you.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.100
And yet.

36:41.101 --> 36:43.066
Okay, well, I'm walkin'.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.466
I can do that.

36:44.467 --> 36:46.733
What happened at the schoolhouse?

36:46.734 --> 36:49.466
I didn't used to have
to ply this outta you.

36:49.467 --> 36:51.300
Hey, I ain't gonna be
walkin' all over the Vil,

36:51.301 --> 36:53.866
chasin' this story, Dave.

36:53.867 --> 36:56.733
You know I ain't scared
of loud talkin', G!

36:56.734 --> 36:58.389
I'll do it!

36:58.390 --> 36:59.612
A'ight!

36:59.613 --> 37:01.269
Okay...

37:07.634 --> 37:09.400
♪... Bitch but you
be runnin' your lip ♪

37:09.401 --> 37:11.066

37:11.067 --> 37:13.933

37:35.334 --> 37:38.265
Hey, big guy. 10, pushin' 11.

37:41.501 --> 37:43.199
You good?

37:55.334 --> 37:58.466
- Uh-huh.
- Caught you slippin'.

37:58.467 --> 38:01.900
You need to be more quiet
sneaking out of Jenna's window.

38:01.901 --> 38:03.966
Yeah? Why?

38:03.967 --> 38:05.800
It's right under Elijah's, fool.

38:05.801 --> 38:09.366
Aw. Miss Elijah keep all our secrets.

38:09.367 --> 38:11.300
Why'd you show 'em?

38:11.301 --> 38:13.032
Nothin' to be ashamed of.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.700
Got you somethin'.

38:24.701 --> 38:26.065
Hmm?

38:31.667 --> 38:33.266
Um...

38:33.267 --> 38:34.866
I- I'm good, man,

38:34.867 --> 38:36.999
I'm really not even hungry.

38:46.867 --> 38:49.033
I'll keep reachin' out, man.

38:49.034 --> 38:50.089
What?

38:50.090 --> 38:52.679
I'll keep reachin' out,
tryin' to connect with you, yo.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.445
I mean, we...

38:58.767 --> 39:00.566
Me and you have been through a lot.

39:00.567 --> 39:02.299
We lost a lot, me and you.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.066
Oh, my bad, B.

39:07.067 --> 39:09.966
Look, I'm an only child, you know that?

39:09.967 --> 39:12.966
You know, as far as I
know, I was his only.

39:12.967 --> 39:15.665
Look, I get jealous.

39:19.601 --> 39:22.766
Always wanted a little
brother like you got,

39:22.767 --> 39:24.499
somebody I could keep safe.

39:27.567 --> 39:30.133
Can't force it, though.

39:30.134 --> 39:33.766
Might not be for us, Dave.

39:33.767 --> 39:35.566
Might have to find somebody else.

39:41.267 --> 39:44.100
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

39:44.101 --> 39:45.333
Tricky little buddy who's a gangsta

39:45.334 --> 39:47.366
stole your sausage, Dave.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.265
That cat eat more than you and me.

39:51.201 --> 39:53.699
I'm... I'm gonna see where he go.

39:57.667 --> 39:59.466
Pussy will get you stuck.

40:12.234 --> 40:14.114
I'll keep reachin' out, man.

40:16.901 --> 40:19.200
I'll keep reachin' out.

40:19.201 --> 40:20.900
Get back to work, kid.

40:44.967 --> 40:47.066
Where do you come from?

40:47.067 --> 40:51.966
Well, where I'm from...
I'm from the Vil.

40:51.967 --> 40:54.700
I come from the 'hood...

40:54.701 --> 40:56.666
The gutter!

40:56.667 --> 40:57.966
What is your story?

40:57.967 --> 41:00.100
A couple of people who know how I work.

41:00.101 --> 41:02.500
Oh, oh, oh. That's funny to you?

41:02.501 --> 41:04.233
And I know y'all see me as a clown,

41:04.234 --> 41:06.065
but my grandfather...

41:09.167 --> 41:10.466
My grandfather.

41:10.467 --> 41:13.233
My granddaddy had to
run out of Alabama for...

41:13.234 --> 41:16.166
for smashin' a white dude
in the head with a bottle,

41:16.167 --> 41:18.300
for spittin' on him.

41:18.301 --> 41:21.633
You see, he didn't play that.

41:21.634 --> 41:25.299
Nei... neither... neither do I.

41:27.467 --> 41:29.400
Stupid.

41:36.301 --> 41:38.000
I come from Growers.

42:11.767 --> 42:15.333
I come from dirt.

42:23.201 --> 42:24.600
I come from water.

42:30.801 --> 42:32.300
I come from laughter.

43:13.601 --> 43:15.233
I come from runners.

43:36.534 --> 43:39.599
Yo! Nailed! Gotta go!

43:42.001 --> 43:43.900
Hey, yo, yo, yo! Gotta go! Gotta go!

43:43.901 --> 43:45.933
Move. Nigga, move.

43:48.534 --> 43:50.399
Shit. 12, 12, 12, 12!

43:57.616 --> 43:58.871
All clear.

43:58.872 --> 44:00.266
They're gone, y'all. They're gone.

44:00.267 --> 44:01.700
- The fuck?
- Yo, yo.

44:01.701 --> 44:03.466
We good, we good? Bro?

44:03.467 --> 44:04.800
Who the fuck got our back, man?

44:04.801 --> 44:06.733
Who the fuck was on watch?

44:16.034 --> 44:17.600
Damn.

44:35.034 --> 44:36.899
It's me.

44:38.567 --> 44:40.299
Come see.

44:49.034 --> 44:51.633
"No longer a throne of...

44:51.634 --> 44:54.900
A goddess to whom we pray."

44:54.901 --> 44:56.865
"Full Moon" by Robert Hayden.

44:58.967 --> 45:00.766
I read that when I was your age.

45:02.501 --> 45:04.699
I asked you to look that up for me.

45:06.234 --> 45:07.965
You find it?

45:15.734 --> 45:16.866
So, what you doin' in there?

45:16.867 --> 45:18.599
Hidin' out?

45:21.634 --> 45:23.366
I keep messin' up.

45:23.367 --> 45:24.500
Yeah?

45:24.501 --> 45:32.566
Well, I would say they give
you an eraser for that, but...

45:32.567 --> 45:34.400
Raynan be a'ight.

45:34.401 --> 45:36.132
No, he won't!

45:39.534 --> 45:41.433
No, he won't.

45:41.434 --> 45:43.689
Look, you supposed to
be focused on school.

45:43.690 --> 45:44.779
I am.

45:44.780 --> 45:46.369
Oh, yeah?

45:46.370 --> 45:50.300
How that Dr. W-T assignment go?

45:50.301 --> 45:52.933
Had my speech prepared.

45:52.934 --> 45:55.033
We didn't do it.

45:55.034 --> 45:56.400
Then...

45:56.401 --> 45:59.033
Seren got up first?

45:59.034 --> 46:00.900
He was tryin' to impress
you all the while.

46:00.901 --> 46:02.233
He was pissin' me off.

46:02.234 --> 46:03.965
Then what'd you do?

46:05.901 --> 46:07.000
Hmm?

46:07.001 --> 46:09.800
Got into it.

46:09.801 --> 46:11.565
I said... what'd you say?

46:15.834 --> 46:19.300
You still ain't ready to talk about it?

46:19.301 --> 46:21.332
Look, I know you feel bad.

46:24.034 --> 46:25.400
You saw red.

46:25.401 --> 46:26.666
You thought somebody close to you

46:26.667 --> 46:29.066
was tryin' to stand in your way.

46:29.067 --> 46:32.166
But that's the world, yeah?

46:32.167 --> 46:33.500
Sometimes you gotta hit 'em...

46:33.501 --> 46:35.965
- I didn't hit him.
- There you go.

46:39.434 --> 46:41.300
I made him hit me.

46:41.301 --> 46:43.966
That's better?

46:43.967 --> 46:45.766
Good plan.

46:45.767 --> 46:47.900
No! No.

46:47.901 --> 46:50.200
They got me seein' the
school psychologist.

46:50.201 --> 46:52.566
Well, play that shit.

46:52.567 --> 46:55.500
Get her to see that you're
one of the good ones.

46:55.501 --> 46:58.233
Get her to see that you're exceptional.

46:58.234 --> 46:59.266
But Seren...

46:59.267 --> 47:02.300
Look, you ain't got time, man.

47:02.301 --> 47:04.833
You ain't got time to be
nobody else's cheerleader.

47:04.834 --> 47:06.833
Decide who team you on, right now.

47:06.834 --> 47:09.266
Go look at that Hurston booklet.

47:09.267 --> 47:11.399
You see two black faces or one?

47:14.401 --> 47:15.865
I know.

47:17.734 --> 47:19.732
I was where you at.

47:20.934 --> 47:24.100
I had to make a choice, and
you see how that turned out.

47:30.334 --> 47:31.366
You a'ight.

47:31.367 --> 47:33.032
You better.

47:34.867 --> 47:36.599
You better.

47:38.201 --> 47:40.166
Make the hard choice.

47:45.167 --> 47:48.566
You still thinkin' 'bout
it... what you said to him?

47:48.567 --> 47:50.299
You think you went too far?

47:54.767 --> 47:57.133
First bite is the hardest, Dave.

48:10.567 --> 48:18.100
"Some I love who are dead
were watchers of the moon.

48:18.101 --> 48:23.100
It shines tonight upon their graves."

48:23.101 --> 48:25.533
Man.

48:25.534 --> 48:26.932
You found it.

48:28.601 --> 48:30.599
Damn.

48:32.201 --> 48:34.299
Say it to me again.

48:35.734 --> 48:37.465
I always loved that piece.

48:39.501 --> 48:45.600
"Some I love who are dead
were watchers of the moon."

49:06.301 --> 49:08.032
Ma?

49:11.567 --> 49:13.332
Be dressed when I get back.

49:34.134 --> 49:36.000
Come on, JG.

49:36.001 --> 49:37.433
Come on!

50:19.201 --> 50:21.066
Yo, yo, yo!

50:24.901 --> 50:26.233
Sorry, Ms. James. I'm late.

50:26.234 --> 50:28.266
The bus didn't come today.
I had to take the metro.

50:28.267 --> 50:29.966
- D.J.
- Yes, ma'am, I know.

50:29.967 --> 50:32.366
The bus stop is 1562 Redly Road.

50:32.367 --> 50:33.699
Hold on.

50:36.034 --> 50:37.765
He's arrived.

50:42.801 --> 50:44.033
I'm sorry I'm late.

50:44.034 --> 50:46.000
You forget something?

50:46.001 --> 50:47.166
Ma'am?

50:47.167 --> 50:48.666
Oh, the form.

50:48.667 --> 50:50.333
I promise I gave it to my mom.

50:50.334 --> 50:53.466
Ooh, you surprise me.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.433
Ma'am?

50:55.434 --> 50:57.856
I spoke with your mother this morning.

50:57.857 --> 50:59.246
She called me.

50:59.247 --> 51:02.435
She wanted to make sure you
were telling her everything.

51:02.436 --> 51:04.358
You could have easily not told her,

51:04.359 --> 51:05.615
her phone not working.

51:05.616 --> 51:07.038
You could have not.

51:07.039 --> 51:08.770
But you did.

51:10.834 --> 51:13.066
That's...

51:13.067 --> 51:16.333
Integrity, David.

51:16.334 --> 51:19.466
Integrity... it means something.

51:19.467 --> 51:21.466
You understand?

51:21.467 --> 51:22.833
Yes, ma'am.

51:22.834 --> 51:26.666
I'm not gonna action
the in-school suspension.

51:26.667 --> 51:30.033
But I want you to see Dr. Bree.

51:30.034 --> 51:33.400
He's gonna talk to you
and get an understanding

51:33.401 --> 51:35.533
of how you're doing here at Galvin...

51:35.534 --> 51:38.266
just a couple of sessions.

51:38.267 --> 51:41.300
He's not in today, but next week.

51:41.301 --> 51:43.000
Okay?

51:48.234 --> 51:49.833
Wh-what about Seren?

51:49.834 --> 51:52.000
Hmm. Get your late pass.

51:52.001 --> 51:53.600
Get to class.

51:59.034 --> 52:01.533
Integriiiiity!

52:08.167 --> 52:09.633
Yo, S.K.!

52:09.634 --> 52:11.366
Takin' a deuce, ya-hey?

52:32.767 --> 52:35.066
What?

52:35.067 --> 52:36.833
Y- you want something?

53:15.267 --> 53:16.999
Got past me today.

53:19.634 --> 53:23.066
I ain't get a chance to talk to you.

53:23.067 --> 53:25.333
I ain't supposed to see you.

53:25.334 --> 53:27.600
Dang.

53:27.601 --> 53:31.066
Yeah, it's cool, li'l man.

53:31.067 --> 53:32.399
I'll go.

53:34.001 --> 53:36.300
I ain't supposed to
be seeing you at all.

53:36.301 --> 53:38.966
You ain't here.

53:38.967 --> 53:40.700
Kept talking about I
gotta do what I gotta do,

53:40.701 --> 53:43.466
and make a choice now.

53:47.234 --> 53:49.166
What do I do now, huh?

53:49.167 --> 53:50.800
Yo, you need to calm down, Dave.

53:50.801 --> 53:52.300
I'm ready!

53:52.301 --> 53:53.800
A'ight, Dave.

53:53.801 --> 53:55.143
You need to go on and sit down.

53:55.144 --> 53:58.233
Yo, fuck you! That dude is my friend.

53:58.234 --> 54:01.166
He told me that shit 'cause
he didn't have no one.

54:01.167 --> 54:03.033
Just like I ain't got no...

54:03.034 --> 54:04.266
he told me that shit about Ray

54:04.267 --> 54:05.500
'cause he was scared.

54:05.501 --> 54:07.166
Hey.

54:07.167 --> 54:08.823
That ain't your fuckin' problem.

54:08.824 --> 54:11.502
- That's my boy!
- You got your own shit to deal with.

54:11.503 --> 54:14.633
Ray layin' his hands
on him is my problem.

54:14.634 --> 54:17.066
His stepdaddy touchin' on him at night,

54:17.067 --> 54:18.166
then beatin' him down like that...

54:18.167 --> 54:21.533
it's my fuckin' problem, too!

54:21.534 --> 54:24.000
You don't...

54:25.801 --> 54:29.533
you ain't supposed to
abandon your boy when they...

54:29.534 --> 54:31.200
And I did that.

54:31.201 --> 54:34.166
I did that.

54:34.167 --> 54:35.766
I got mad 'cause he
was doin' better than me

54:35.767 --> 54:38.666
and whispered that shit to him.

54:38.667 --> 54:40.932
Ray teachin' you somethin'
new at night, huh?

54:43.134 --> 54:45.400
I told him that shit
like it wasn't nothin',

54:45.401 --> 54:46.900
sayin' that shit in front
of the class and all,

54:46.901 --> 54:48.333
like it wasn't nothin',

54:48.334 --> 54:51.000
Knowin'... knowin'
it was gonna hurt him,

54:51.001 --> 54:52.533
knowin' it's fucked up!

54:52.534 --> 54:54.200
And 'cause of you!

54:54.201 --> 54:55.900
You in my head telling me
to make the hard choices,

54:55.901 --> 54:58.766
and to choose now, but you ain't here!

54:58.767 --> 55:01.533
Just a stupid-ass fucked up
dope boy that got ran up on!

55:01.534 --> 55:03.565
They shot your ass, remember?

55:05.234 --> 55:07.333
You dead!

55:07.334 --> 55:09.633
I know. Look, I gotta go.

55:09.634 --> 55:11.533
Don't ever talk to me again!

55:11.534 --> 55:13.166
I'm not supposed to be seeing you.

55:13.167 --> 55:14.533
You dead, Sky!

55:14.534 --> 55:18.466
"Some I love who are dead
were watchers of the moon."

55:18.467 --> 55:20.800
I can't even see you! Ugh!

55:20.801 --> 55:22.466
"It shines tonight..."

55:22.467 --> 55:25.566
Aaaaah! "... Upon their graves."

55:25.567 --> 55:27.600
You dead!

55:27.601 --> 55:30.532
They... they shot you dead!

55:31.767 --> 55:33.599
Remember?!

55:34.634 --> 55:35.823
Go!

55:35.824 --> 55:36.866
Go!

55:36.867 --> 55:38.300
Go!

56:29.201 --> 56:32.733
First bite is the hardest, Dave.
