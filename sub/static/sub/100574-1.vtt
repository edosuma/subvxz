WEBVTT

00:11.344 --> 00:14.427
- [Jacob] Where are we gonna find it?

00:20.560 --> 00:23.390
- [Abbey] Jacob, what did you do?

00:23.390 --> 00:24.380
- What?

00:24.380 --> 00:26.020
- [Abbey] Did you mean to hurt it?

00:26.020 --> 00:26.853
- What?

00:26.853 --> 00:27.930
- Did you hurt it on purpose?

00:27.930 --> 00:29.093
- What's "on purpose"?

00:30.471 --> 00:32.570
- [Abbey] Did you mean to kill it

00:32.570 --> 00:34.220
or was it an accident, sweetheart?

00:34.220 --> 00:35.470
Daddy and I want to know.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.353
Look at me.

00:40.780 --> 00:41.613
Jacob.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.950
Just turn the camera off.

00:45.950 --> 00:46.947
Just turn it off.

00:51.705 --> 00:54.622
(keyboard tapping)

01:07.398 --> 01:10.898
- This is the kind of shit I come home to.

01:15.210 --> 01:16.193
Seven pairs.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.053
Seven pairs.

01:29.530 --> 01:30.533
Sounds bother him.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.223
Certain sounds, anyway.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.403
Like high heels on linoleum.

01:44.880 --> 01:45.930
Yeah, well...

01:47.440 --> 01:49.540
I'm keeping track of this shit now, Jacob.

01:51.530 --> 01:52.380
I'm recording it.

01:54.519 --> 01:57.602
(aggressive banging)

02:00.118 --> 02:04.451
- [Jacob] (crying) I hate you, mom!

02:07.377 --> 02:08.363
- You hear that?

02:09.750 --> 02:10.810
That's Jacob blowing a fit

02:10.810 --> 02:13.299
because I told him he had to reimburse me.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.494
(heavy thudding)

02:15.494 --> 02:16.920
You wanna monster out, that's fine.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.380
Monster out.

02:18.380 --> 02:20.064
- [Jacob] Leave me alone.

02:20.064 --> 02:22.553
Fucking psycho.

02:22.553 --> 02:25.260
- Yeah, I'm a fucking psycho.

02:25.260 --> 02:26.900
'Cause I told him, until he reimburses me,

02:26.900 --> 02:28.685
he's not getting his PlayStation back.

02:28.685 --> 02:30.550
(loud bang)

02:30.550 --> 02:31.773
I'm recording this!

02:41.590 --> 02:42.610
Jacob.

02:42.610 --> 02:44.080
It was seven pairs.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.120
- [Jacob] I didn't
touch your stupid shoes.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.070
- What?

02:48.070 --> 02:51.070
- [Jacob] (crying) I didn't
touch your stupid shoes.

02:51.070 --> 02:51.903
- Very funny.

02:55.150 --> 02:55.983
What did you throw?

02:55.983 --> 02:57.580
What smashed?

02:57.580 --> 02:58.413
- Nothing.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.653
You're the one "monstering out", okay?

03:01.653 --> 03:03.630
Just take a bath or something...

03:09.828 --> 03:12.578
(mouse clicking)

03:15.440 --> 03:18.310
Welcome to the worst town in America;

03:18.310 --> 03:19.600
Parma, Ohio.
- Hey.

03:20.840 --> 03:25.080
I am here interviewing the
aloof new boy of the school,

03:25.080 --> 03:27.513
Jacob Bell, everyone!

03:28.390 --> 03:29.570
Save "hi", Jacob.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.673
Stop it!

03:37.290 --> 03:38.483
- My name is Abbey.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.400
I live in Parma, Ohio--

03:42.400 --> 03:43.970
Oh shit!

03:43.970 --> 03:45.113
I'm thirty.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.611
Well, mid 30s.

03:48.611 --> 03:49.863
Mid to late 30s.

03:50.910 --> 03:51.850
Not 40...

03:52.773 --> 03:54.193
Definitely not 40.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.423
My name is Abbey.

04:05.780 --> 04:07.003
I'm 42 years old.

04:09.020 --> 04:10.023
I'm a single mom.

04:11.570 --> 04:16.000
My son, Jacob, he just
turned 16, which is...

04:17.166 --> 04:19.692
Well, that's a handful
for any kind of mom.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.800
The thing is...

04:26.010 --> 04:27.130
Jacob is...

04:30.790 --> 04:32.280
I think he is, anyway...

04:37.660 --> 04:39.090
I think he's going to...

04:45.114 --> 04:46.364
This is stupid.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.810
- [Greg] Dude, we gotta get outta here.

04:50.810 --> 04:52.310
We're gonna get arrested, bro.

04:55.980 --> 04:56.930
What are you doing?

04:59.460 --> 05:00.573
- Natural selection.

05:01.870 --> 05:03.580
- [Greg] Oh, don't even
play like that, bro.

05:03.580 --> 05:06.295
You're gonna cause a fucking
accident or something.

05:06.295 --> 05:07.160
Oh fuck!

05:07.160 --> 05:08.792
Shit!

05:08.792 --> 05:10.825
Get the fuck out of here, bro!

05:10.825 --> 05:12.158
Dude go, go, go!

05:20.521 --> 05:21.771
- Look at this.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.823
If this was just for
his geometry assignment,

05:31.800 --> 05:33.393
why would he draw himself, huh?

05:37.317 --> 05:39.623
"To demonstrate scale" my ass.

05:42.594 --> 05:43.744
And here, look at this.

05:48.760 --> 05:51.160
Why would a 14 year old
boy even have this, huh?

05:57.931 --> 05:59.860
What kind of kid wants
to turn his pellet gun

05:59.860 --> 06:01.123
into an automatic weapon?

06:04.160 --> 06:06.520
Bump stocks were not invented
for fucking air guns,

06:06.520 --> 06:07.510
I'll tell you that.

06:12.610 --> 06:13.870
I'm sorry, I just...

06:15.840 --> 06:17.990
I don't understand why there
aren't more resources out there

06:17.990 --> 06:19.830
to deal with this kind of thing.

06:19.830 --> 06:21.293
I reported him two years ago.

06:22.420 --> 06:24.130
And yeah, they launched an investigation,

06:24.130 --> 06:26.437
put Jacob under surveillance.

06:26.437 --> 06:28.165
"Your son provided a rational explanation

06:28.165 --> 06:29.857
"for every offense."

06:31.180 --> 06:32.280
That's what they said.

06:33.377 --> 06:34.917
"Rational explanation."

06:36.300 --> 06:37.350
Now I'm the bad guy

06:37.350 --> 06:39.780
'cause Jacob served time
in a diversion program

06:42.508 --> 06:43.458
and we had to move.

06:45.748 --> 06:46.581
Again.

06:49.893 --> 06:51.160
He's already in therapy,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.247
so couldn't blame me for that one.

07:00.490 --> 07:02.410
My mom spent a shit ton in legal fees

07:02.410 --> 07:04.043
to get all this stuff back, too.

07:04.970 --> 07:06.993
God forbid it goes on his record.

07:07.930 --> 07:08.805
She's like,

07:08.805 --> 07:09.940
"You don't wanna be the boy
who cried 'wolf', do you?"

07:09.940 --> 07:10.903
I'm like, "No, mom.

07:11.977 --> 07:12.817
"I don't."

07:15.330 --> 07:18.660
By the way, the boy who cried wolf

07:20.980 --> 07:22.443
got eaten by the fuckin' wolf.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.550
- We were talking about how
to get more bang for your buck

07:31.550 --> 07:33.400
out of everyone's favorite AR-15.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.930
And with you guys shooting the .223s

07:34.930 --> 07:37.926
or the 5.56s, everyone knows--

07:37.926 --> 07:40.676
(video skipping)

07:41.870 --> 07:44.753
- [Abbey] Sleeping Jacob
is my favorite Jacob.

07:46.240 --> 07:50.440
He had almost a two hour tantrum.

07:50.440 --> 07:51.943
Worked himself into a fit.

07:53.410 --> 07:54.523
Now he's sleeping.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.736
Honey, I don't think
you can climb on that!

07:57.736 --> 07:59.800
- [Dad] There are all those
babies living in there.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.633
- [Abbey] That's somebody's--

08:00.633 --> 08:01.859
That's a birdhouse.

08:01.859 --> 08:02.692
No, no!

08:02.692 --> 08:04.104
Babies, no!

08:04.104 --> 08:05.963
- [Dad] There are baby birds in there.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.796
- [Abbey] Let go, now!

08:08.954 --> 08:09.977
- What?

08:09.977 --> 08:11.394
- [Abbey] Let go.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.970
- [Dad] That's why that bird
is swooping at your head.

08:14.970 --> 08:16.159
- [Abbey] They're very upset.

08:16.159 --> 08:17.530
- [Mom] Walk away!

08:21.702 --> 08:25.869
(rap music plays through earbuds)

08:27.910 --> 08:29.763
- You know that's illegal, right?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.669
- [Abbey] The light's red.

08:32.669 --> 08:34.270
- What are you recording me for?

08:35.538 --> 08:36.371
- [Abbey] I want to capture

08:36.371 --> 08:38.070
that miraculous transformation you make.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.270
When you're alone in the car with mom

08:40.270 --> 08:42.270
to when you're not alone
in the car with mom.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.280
- For what; for who?

08:50.380 --> 08:53.410
Hey, Detective Kelly, remember me?

08:53.410 --> 08:55.350
Mom's freaking out again.

08:55.350 --> 08:56.410
- Knock it off.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.168
- She came home totally hammered

08:58.168 --> 09:01.730
and she cut up all her shoes.

09:01.730 --> 09:03.610
She's probably gonna say I did it,

09:03.610 --> 09:04.810
but just for the record.

09:05.730 --> 09:06.563
Later.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.713
- [Abbey] You're disgusting.

09:08.713 --> 09:10.433
Look me in the eye and say that again.

09:11.870 --> 09:13.540
- You were drunk.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.260
You cut up your shoes.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.093
Again.

09:17.492 --> 09:18.490
(car horn blares)

09:18.490 --> 09:19.973
Fucking go already.

09:23.910 --> 09:26.320
- Well, he knows I'm recording, so.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.520
Technically, he's still
in the car with mom.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.663
This may be the "other Jacob" emerging.

09:34.150 --> 09:35.303
The fake Jacob.

09:37.397 --> 09:42.110
The thing is, he doesn't
fit the profile of a...

09:43.090 --> 09:46.810
I mean he has friends
and gets good grades.

09:46.810 --> 09:47.993
His teachers like him.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.360
Except from that one
jerky science teacher,

09:51.360 --> 09:53.003
everyone loves the fake Jacob.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.720
(bell rings)

09:56.720 --> 10:00.043
To be honest, every time
they tell me I'm wrong,

10:01.151 --> 10:02.770
that I'm exaggerating his symptoms,

10:02.770 --> 10:05.973
I feel this enormous sense of relief.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.963
I mean, what if it is me?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.023
What if Jacob is okay?

10:16.087 --> 10:18.653
"Psychosomatic projection",
I think they call it.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.890
It's when you experience
this trauma as a kid,

10:21.890 --> 10:24.690
this extreme fucking trauma

10:24.690 --> 10:28.400
and you project that on your husband,

10:28.400 --> 10:30.203
your kid, your parents.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.340
Then I think, "What if it's not me?"

10:36.760 --> 10:38.023
What if it's genetic?

10:40.490 --> 10:43.990
Sometimes when I look in
his eyes I get this replay,

10:43.990 --> 10:46.723
this instant fucking replay of Jerry,

10:47.559 --> 10:50.807
and I imagine him in that
Mustang with his sawed off--

10:50.807 --> 10:51.640
(banging on window)

10:51.640 --> 10:52.790
- [School Officer] Pickup
and drop-off only, ma'am.

10:52.790 --> 10:53.623
- [Abbey] Thank you!

10:53.623 --> 10:54.456
Sorry.

10:55.930 --> 10:57.143
This is his room.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.730
When he's not at school,

11:05.730 --> 11:08.083
this is where he spends most of his time.

11:10.870 --> 11:11.963
All of his time.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.800
This is Adolf.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.633
Hi!

11:18.530 --> 11:20.903
Last one died, so this is Adolf Junior.

11:21.868 --> 11:23.853
Or Adolf Junior Jr., maybe.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.223
As you can see,

11:30.015 --> 11:31.530
he plays a lot of video games.

11:31.530 --> 11:33.493
I think that's pretty normal.

11:34.638 --> 11:35.633
I mean,

11:37.770 --> 11:38.713
is that normal?

11:40.330 --> 11:42.280
Spend five, six hours a day?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.510
I don't know, just...

11:44.750 --> 11:45.763
Shooting people.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.483
People say it's normal.

11:51.330 --> 11:52.163
People.

11:56.060 --> 11:59.073
What's not normal, is this.

12:03.531 --> 12:05.480
(locked door handle rattles)

12:05.480 --> 12:06.433
Are you kidding me?

12:06.433 --> 12:07.266
Jesus.

12:08.710 --> 12:10.760
- Talk American.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.064
- [Girlfriend] Would you like
me better if I was British?

12:13.064 --> 12:14.100
(Jacob gags)

12:14.100 --> 12:14.933
- No.

12:17.010 --> 12:17.843
- [Girlfriend] Hey, you've gotta help me

12:17.843 --> 12:18.923
with my science project.

12:20.257 --> 12:21.673
- It's so easy.

12:21.673 --> 12:23.923
- [Girlfriend] It's
not easy for all of us.

12:25.254 --> 12:26.990
Aren't you supposed to be
really smart or something?

12:26.990 --> 12:27.940
What are you doing?

12:29.561 --> 12:30.950
(Jacob imitates gunshot)

12:30.950 --> 12:32.213
You're such an asshole!

12:33.529 --> 12:34.362
- [Jacob] (Laughing) Whatever.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.000
He's fucking old anyway.

12:36.000 --> 12:36.833
- [Girlfriend] Why?

12:36.833 --> 12:38.340
You think we should just
kill off all old people?

12:38.340 --> 12:39.386
- Yes!

12:39.386 --> 12:40.841
That is a good idea!

12:40.841 --> 12:41.676
- [Girlfriend] Oh Whatever.
- [Jacob] See?

12:41.676 --> 12:44.240
You're already halfway done
with your science project.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.300
- Fucking jaw off...

12:46.220 --> 12:47.870
- [Abbey] Say what you just said.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.643
I'm serious.

12:50.643 --> 12:51.790
Say what you just said.

12:51.790 --> 12:52.623
- Stop already.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.230
- [Abbey] Knock it off.

12:55.230 --> 12:56.240
- Chill, mom, seriously.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.073
- [Abbey] Let go.

12:57.073 --> 12:57.906
Ow, you're hurting me.

12:57.906 --> 12:59.187
- I'm not even touching you.

13:00.730 --> 13:01.563
- Jacob!

13:08.790 --> 13:10.940
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

13:18.610 --> 13:23.610
Okay, I got this when he was
around two of wetting the bed

13:25.620 --> 13:26.853
with his diapers on.

13:30.970 --> 13:33.820
I caught him taking them
off, pissing the bed,

13:33.820 --> 13:35.720
and putting his diapers back on again.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.323
Little creep.

13:40.340 --> 13:42.253
Shit, where's the charging thingy?

13:45.503 --> 13:46.490
(straw sipping)

13:46.490 --> 13:47.323
Testing.

13:55.510 --> 13:56.400
All right...

13:57.910 --> 14:01.443
Okay, so it's May 4th, 2018, by the way.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.020
Jacob should be home any minute.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.330
If his PlayStation isn't back in his room,

14:07.330 --> 14:08.827
he's gonna rip my jaw off.

14:09.809 --> 14:10.642
That's what he said,

14:10.642 --> 14:12.387
"I'll rip your fucking jaw off."

14:15.440 --> 14:16.273
Look, I know.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.500
I know I'm not handling
this well; I know that.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.990
He can't keep breaking my shit.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.490
He's not a little kid anymore.

14:24.887 --> 14:27.180
I know, I know...

14:29.687 --> 14:30.623
I'm a mom.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.857
I'm a mom--

14:37.904 --> 14:40.821
(front door opens)

14:45.330 --> 14:46.163
Hey.

14:59.120 --> 14:59.953
- Mom...

15:01.570 --> 15:02.670
What the hell is this?

15:04.010 --> 15:06.250
- Sign it, and I will give
you your PlayStation back.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.450
- Are you fucking joking?

15:07.450 --> 15:08.647
- Lose the attitude, Jacob.

15:08.647 --> 15:11.610
You can pay me back a
little bit at a time.

15:19.273 --> 15:21.460
(phone buzzes)

15:21.460 --> 15:22.620
Why are you calling me?

15:22.620 --> 15:24.127
- Why do you think?

15:24.127 --> 15:25.660
- I'm not recording you.

15:25.660 --> 15:26.493
- Where is it?

15:36.200 --> 15:37.550
- It's not in there, Jacob.

15:39.215 --> 15:41.570
- Where the fuck is my PlayStation?

15:41.570 --> 15:43.060
I told you; I warned you!

15:43.060 --> 15:46.523
- And I told you if you sign
it, you will get it back.

15:52.340 --> 15:55.113
Jacob, don't do that.

15:58.070 --> 16:01.590
God, if you could just not
be a little shit for once...

16:01.590 --> 16:03.380
Okay, you know what?

16:03.380 --> 16:04.213
I'm out.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.460
I'm not doing this with you.

16:07.011 --> 16:08.227
Okay--

16:08.227 --> 16:09.207
Jacob!

16:09.207 --> 16:10.040
Stop it now!

16:10.040 --> 16:10.873
(Jacob yells)

16:10.873 --> 16:11.706
No!

16:15.896 --> 16:20.229
(thrashing comes from Jacob's room)

17:27.714 --> 17:28.715
- I'm sorry.

17:34.773 --> 17:35.606
- I know.

18:04.970 --> 18:09.933
- [Jacob] So, what was the
worst day of your life?

18:11.620 --> 18:12.640
- Jesus...

18:15.070 --> 18:17.423
Probably the day my stepmom moved in.

18:18.710 --> 18:19.543
- [Jacob] Why?

18:21.030 --> 18:21.863
- I don't know.

18:21.863 --> 18:23.590
Because it just meant my
mom wasn't coming home

18:23.590 --> 18:26.483
and it made everything like really final.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.040
And she sucks.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.683
She's the worst.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.702
- [Jacob] Want me to just kill her?

18:36.702 --> 18:39.730
- Yeah, Jacob, fantastic idea.

18:39.730 --> 18:40.563
Thank you.

18:42.980 --> 18:46.110
So, is it true you moved here

18:46.110 --> 18:48.250
because you got kicked out of Riverside?

18:48.250 --> 18:49.083
- Is that your question?

18:49.083 --> 18:50.280
- [Girlfriend] Yeah.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.008
- You and everybody else.

18:52.008 --> 18:54.175
Ask me something original.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.620
- [Girlfriend] Okay,

18:57.620 --> 18:59.773
what's with the long sleeves all the time?

19:00.920 --> 19:03.350
- What's with all the
fuckin' push-up bras?

19:03.350 --> 19:04.820
- [Girlfriend] Whoa, it's truth or dare.

19:04.820 --> 19:06.030
You have to answer.

19:06.030 --> 19:06.863
C'mon--

19:06.863 --> 19:07.832
- Stop it.

19:07.832 --> 19:09.587
It's a stupid game.

19:09.587 --> 19:11.920
- Okay, and this is his Risperidone.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.580
It's kinda like an antidepressant.

19:14.580 --> 19:19.580
Well, actually it's an
antipsychotic but that's a bit much.

19:20.290 --> 19:22.040
He takes that with the Carbamazepine,

19:22.040 --> 19:23.524
which is for seizures.

19:23.524 --> 19:24.580
Well, that's wrong.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.280
I mean, it's not wrong, it's
just not why he takes it.

19:28.760 --> 19:33.720
Adderall, 15 milligrams
of this every morning.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.647
For his, y'know--

19:36.647 --> 19:38.133
His attention deficit.

19:39.230 --> 19:40.640
Can you hear me now?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.760
- I can hear you just fine.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.360
Your face just keeps freezing up.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.700
Why can't we just talk on the telephone?

19:46.700 --> 19:47.810
- You look fine, mom.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.113
- Yeah, look at my hair!

19:49.113 --> 19:51.290
Let me get some lipstick on.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.100
- Listen, mom, Jacob's gonna be home soon.

19:53.100 --> 19:53.933
Could you just--

19:53.933 --> 19:54.766
- I'm listening, honey.

19:54.766 --> 19:57.350
I'm just getting my lipstick thingy.

19:57.350 --> 19:59.580
- He's having the tantrums again.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.230
The other day, he pinned
me up against a wall

20:01.230 --> 20:02.840
and I couldn't get out
from underneath him.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.250
- Well why would you let him do that?

20:04.250 --> 20:06.623
Boys aren't supposed to
wrestle with their mothers.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.990
That's what fathers are for.

20:07.990 --> 20:08.823
- No, don't.

20:08.823 --> 20:10.167
Don't do that.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.000
- What?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.210
What'd I do?

20:12.210 --> 20:13.260
I didn't even say his name.

20:13.260 --> 20:14.370
- We weren't wrestling, mom.

20:14.370 --> 20:15.617
He was angry, okay?

20:15.617 --> 20:17.000
- Well he's a teenager.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.420
Teenagers are moody, especially boys.

20:19.420 --> 20:20.253
All those hormones.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.610
- No, this wasn't hormones, mom.

20:21.610 --> 20:25.697
His eyes, they were blank, detached.

20:28.050 --> 20:29.030
He looked like...

20:30.120 --> 20:31.313
He looked like Jerry.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.708
- I don't wanna do this again, Abbey.

20:35.708 --> 20:36.980
- I know you don't want to do this, mom.

20:36.980 --> 20:38.010
I don't want to do this either,

20:38.010 --> 20:39.470
but what if they were wrong?

20:39.470 --> 20:41.207
I mean, mom, if you could have
done something to stop Jerry,

20:41.207 --> 20:43.070
you would have done it, right?

20:43.070 --> 20:45.180
- You don't even know
what you're talking about!

20:45.180 --> 20:47.020
You were a baby.

20:47.020 --> 20:48.469
- I was twelve.

20:48.469 --> 20:50.240
- I don't wanna talk about this.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.300
- Mom, there must have
been some kind of signs.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.260
You must have noticed something.

20:54.260 --> 20:56.717
- I can't believe this is happening again.

20:56.717 --> 20:59.040
Are you taking your medications?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.592
- Yes, of course I'm taking my medication.

21:01.592 --> 21:03.320
- But they're not helping?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.500
- They're not helping Jacob.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.940
Jesus, mom.

21:05.940 --> 21:08.070
- Okay, what did you find?

21:08.070 --> 21:09.655
Did you find something?

21:09.655 --> 21:11.480
- No, I don't...

21:11.480 --> 21:13.900
He's cutting up my shoes again

21:13.900 --> 21:17.310
and the nicks on his arms.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.550
- New nicks?

21:18.550 --> 21:19.383
- No.

21:19.383 --> 21:20.216
I don't know.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.690
I mean, mom, what if he hurts me?

21:23.690 --> 21:25.150
What if he hurts someone else?

21:25.150 --> 21:28.250
- Abigail, the things you're saying...

21:28.250 --> 21:29.453
What you're implying,

21:30.290 --> 21:31.630
it's very serious.

21:31.630 --> 21:33.320
- I know!

21:33.320 --> 21:35.650
- I don't think you should tell anyone.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.380
- I'm telling you, mom.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.970
- And I believed you the last time,

21:39.970 --> 21:41.722
all the way to the end.

21:41.722 --> 21:44.140
Universities look for that kind of stuff.

21:44.140 --> 21:45.847
I know they say they don't, but they do.

21:45.847 --> 21:48.040
And all those medications you have him on,

21:48.040 --> 21:49.040
they all go on his record.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.250
I warned you about that;

21:50.250 --> 21:53.570
If something bad happens
and Jacob takes the fall.

21:53.570 --> 21:55.974
- No, mom, I'm trying
to prevent something bad

21:55.974 --> 21:57.700
from happening.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.192
- Maybe you should talk to Howard.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.025
(front door opens)

22:00.025 --> 22:00.858
You remember Howard?

22:00.858 --> 22:01.760
Howard's a vault.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.620
- 'Kay, you know what, mom?

22:02.620 --> 22:03.860
I gotta go.

22:03.860 --> 22:05.200
I'll call you later.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.290
- Abigail, you're not sure, are you?

22:09.290 --> 22:11.090
- I'll call you later.

22:11.090 --> 22:12.600
- Call who later?

22:12.600 --> 22:13.433
- [Nana] Is that Jacob?

22:13.433 --> 22:14.810
Honey, is that you?

22:14.810 --> 22:15.833
- Nana?

22:18.237 --> 22:19.671
What up, Nana?

22:19.671 --> 22:21.930
- Oh my god, you're gigantic!

22:21.930 --> 22:23.908
So handsome!

22:23.908 --> 22:25.540
- Aw, c'mon now, Nana.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.478
You say that to all the boys!

22:27.478 --> 22:30.070
- [Nana] What a horrible face.

22:30.070 --> 22:31.370
Uncross your eyes!

22:31.370 --> 22:32.590
- Nana, my eyes are stuck!

22:32.590 --> 22:34.270
I'm gonna be cross-eyed forever!

22:34.270 --> 22:35.103
Oh my god!

22:35.103 --> 22:35.977
Nana, no!

22:35.977 --> 22:36.810
(imitates gunshot)

22:36.810 --> 22:40.480
(Nana laughs merrily)

22:40.480 --> 22:42.730
Hey, thanks for the
birthday cash you sent.

22:42.730 --> 22:43.870
That was awesome.

22:43.870 --> 22:45.277
- [Nana] I wanted to get you a present,

22:45.277 --> 22:47.310
but you're so hard to shop for these days.

22:47.310 --> 22:48.480
- Oh, so get this.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.330
Urban has these killer combat boots.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.200
You can order them online and everything.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.140
- [Nana] Urban...

22:53.140 --> 22:55.070
Urban what?

22:55.070 --> 22:57.200
- Here, just type in this website, ready?

22:57.200 --> 22:58.313
- Oh no, no, no.

22:58.313 --> 22:59.146
(chuckling) I can't.

22:59.146 --> 23:01.480
Just buy the boots with the
birthday present I sent.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.610
- What if you set me up with a credit card

23:03.610 --> 23:05.640
and I'll hook you up with
a dope-ass Snapchat account

23:05.640 --> 23:08.200
where you can see what I'm
doing like every five minutes.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.956
- Don't listen to him, mom.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.257
- Yeah, you may have gotten bigger

23:11.257 --> 23:13.190
but you haven't changed a bit!

23:13.190 --> 23:14.680
- Is that a yes?

23:14.680 --> 23:17.630
- No, you can get him a
credit card when he's 18.

23:17.630 --> 23:18.463
- [Nana] Deal.

23:18.463 --> 23:20.093
But I better put a limit on it.

23:22.810 --> 23:24.310
- Did you just hang up on her?

23:25.723 --> 23:27.253
Why would you do that?

23:27.253 --> 23:28.961
- When I'm 18?

23:28.961 --> 23:29.794
Please.

23:40.021 --> 23:44.354
(rap music plays from Jacob's room)

23:46.078 --> 23:48.828
(door squealing)

23:49.990 --> 23:50.913
- [Abbey] Jacob?

23:55.080 --> 23:57.541
Jacob, I know you're down here.

23:57.541 --> 23:59.791
(rustling)

24:08.010 --> 24:09.073
Jacob, honey?

24:10.871 --> 24:11.704
- Ah!

24:11.704 --> 24:13.720
- [Abbey] Oh my god!

24:13.720 --> 24:14.880
Jesus, you scared...

24:17.907 --> 24:18.870
God damn it...

24:21.853 --> 24:23.410
Are you in my robe?

24:23.410 --> 24:25.465
- [Voicemail] Shipping
out your Eczema cream,

24:25.465 --> 24:26.298
but we couldn't retail your--

24:26.298 --> 24:28.273
(door squeals)

24:28.273 --> 24:30.550
For the cosmetic moisturizing gloves

24:30.550 --> 24:33.200
because it looks like your
mom's credit card expired.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.845
- He install this himself?

24:35.845 --> 24:37.010
- I don't know, I guess he must have.

24:37.010 --> 24:39.180
- Man, you got a smart kid on your hands.

24:39.180 --> 24:41.520
- Yeah, thanks.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.780
I really appreciate it.

24:42.780 --> 24:43.613
- Yeah.

24:59.293 --> 25:01.143
- God, it smells like crap in here.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.030
Like burnt rubber or something...

25:11.890 --> 25:14.010
His baby pictures.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.163
He was six when he started drawing these.

25:17.300 --> 25:18.610
As you can see, they've been rescued

25:18.610 --> 25:20.283
from the trash a few times.

25:23.030 --> 25:24.623
I asked him if that was me;

25:26.089 --> 25:28.173
if that was Jacob in Mommy's belly.

25:29.610 --> 25:31.943
He said no, it was Nana;

25:33.170 --> 25:34.823
he didn't know who the baby was.

25:37.117 --> 25:42.063
I mean, if that's Nana,
then who's the baby?

25:44.490 --> 25:46.190
I never told him about my brother.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.993
I never told him about Jerry.

25:54.330 --> 25:55.163
Anyway...

26:05.130 --> 26:06.813
Oh, nice, Jacob.

26:08.910 --> 26:11.211
Oh, Jesus...

26:11.211 --> 26:12.443
Shit.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.350
Oh my god!

26:48.350 --> 26:49.793
Shit, shit, shit!

26:50.730 --> 26:53.283
No, c'mon, get back in.

26:54.508 --> 26:57.283
He feeds these to Adolf, that's all.

27:12.948 --> 27:13.865
What the...

27:18.425 --> 27:19.675
Jesus Christ...

27:25.163 --> 27:26.413
Holy shit.

27:31.974 --> 27:34.474
What the fuck did he do to it?

27:40.120 --> 27:41.080
Oh, Jesus...

27:43.030 --> 27:44.618
I suppose you're gonna
find a rational explanation

27:44.618 --> 27:45.833
for this too, huh?

27:48.340 --> 27:49.463
My name is Abbey.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.723
I'm 42 years old.

27:52.580 --> 27:53.583
I'm a single mom.

27:55.490 --> 28:00.490
I think my 16 year old
son is a psychopath.

28:03.757 --> 28:05.507
I'm not trying to prove it anymore.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.023
By the time, I'm sure it'll be too late.

28:10.664 --> 28:13.014
I'm not doing this for
the authorities, either.

28:13.962 --> 28:15.740
No, I'm...

28:15.740 --> 28:17.353
I'm making these videos for you.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.923
For all you other moms out there

28:22.496 --> 28:25.793
who know deep down that
your kid is a bad kid.

28:28.069 --> 28:29.583
But you still love him.

28:33.210 --> 28:34.463
Because he's your son.

28:37.918 --> 28:39.268
We're gonna look for signs.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.450
We're gonna look for patterns, you and me,

28:44.520 --> 28:46.320
and together, we're gonna figure out

28:47.710 --> 28:48.990
if you are "that" mom

28:51.032 --> 28:52.563
and if your kid is "that" kid.

28:55.466 --> 28:56.780
I mean, let's face it.

28:58.837 --> 29:00.053
If I'm wrong,

29:02.900 --> 29:05.150
if these videos never
see the light of day...

29:06.900 --> 29:11.003
But if I'm right, if you're watching this,

29:14.540 --> 29:17.573
(laughs) I'm already dead.

29:18.929 --> 29:23.130
(speculative piano plays)

29:23.130 --> 29:25.190
I'm not saying therapists can't help,

29:25.190 --> 29:26.810
but do your own research.

29:26.810 --> 29:28.090
And not just on the internet either;

29:28.090 --> 29:30.493
there are books, interviews,
published studies.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.010
Okay, so there's the usual stuff;

29:33.010 --> 29:36.670
the lack of empathy, antisocial behavior,

29:36.670 --> 29:37.670
pathological lying.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.200
That's a big one.

29:39.200 --> 29:40.710
But then there are the more subtle signs

29:40.710 --> 29:45.017
like chronic conspiracy
theories or racism.

29:46.510 --> 29:48.120
That's a big one.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.843
NPV, Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.700
I hope you're writing this down.

29:54.700 --> 29:57.192
I guess you could always just rewind.

29:57.192 --> 29:58.460
(off key piano notes)

29:58.460 --> 29:59.293
By the way,

30:00.977 --> 30:03.655
if you're not a mom with a troubled kid

30:03.655 --> 30:04.905
and you're watching this,

30:07.065 --> 30:08.265
you're a psychopath too.

30:10.530 --> 30:11.993
Have some fucking respect.

30:13.890 --> 30:14.723
- [Greg] You're crazy.

30:14.723 --> 30:15.840
I don't know, man.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.800
- This is Jacob Bell

30:17.800 --> 30:22.170
coming to you live with the
electro shock challenge.

30:22.170 --> 30:24.190
We got a electric dog collar

30:24.190 --> 30:26.430
that I stole from my stupid neighbor

30:28.050 --> 30:33.050
and this should pack a pretty
heavy punch to my jugular.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.830
So let's try some levels.

30:34.830 --> 30:37.960
Let's start with...

30:37.960 --> 30:38.793
Eight.

30:38.793 --> 30:39.920
- [Greg] An eight?

30:39.920 --> 30:40.753
Oh shit, man.

30:40.753 --> 30:41.750
You are out of your mind!

30:41.750 --> 30:42.844
- Pussy.

30:42.844 --> 30:43.710
(laughing)

30:43.710 --> 30:44.714
Three--

30:44.714 --> 30:45.547
- [Greg] I don't know about this, man.

30:45.547 --> 30:47.119
- Two, one.

30:47.119 --> 30:48.853
(electric collar buzzing)

30:48.853 --> 30:50.152
- Oh shit!

30:50.152 --> 30:51.130
(Jacob breathing heavily)

30:51.130 --> 30:53.849
Bro, are you all right?

30:53.849 --> 30:56.180
- That was fucking awesome!

30:58.743 --> 31:01.100
- What kind of supplies.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.770
- Well, the science lab is missing

31:04.670 --> 31:09.670
some specimen pins,
closures, sodium hydroxide,

31:11.580 --> 31:13.810
a container of formaldehyde.

31:13.810 --> 31:15.760
- Great, so if I hadn't stopped by today

31:15.760 --> 31:19.320
I'd just have to guess
why my son got detention?

31:19.320 --> 31:20.400
- We sent the letter.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.620
- I told you that's not my signature.

31:22.620 --> 31:24.460
- Listen, is this gonna go on his record.

31:24.460 --> 31:25.720
- His record?

31:25.720 --> 31:28.493
No, this stays in his
file until he graduates.

31:29.580 --> 31:30.413
- I don't know why

31:30.413 --> 31:32.400
you guys are still
teaching dissection anyway.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.860
It was banned in the Riverside
district two years ago.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.610
- It's not about dissection, really.

31:36.610 --> 31:38.860
It's more about electric
muscle stimulation;

31:38.860 --> 31:41.440
teaching the students
about the human body.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.010
- Great.

31:43.010 --> 31:46.240
- Look, Jacob is a very gifted student.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.210
I wouldn't worry so much
about what's in his file,

31:48.210 --> 31:51.020
just put it into conversation with him.

31:51.020 --> 31:53.401
Transparency is key
with this sort of thing.

31:53.401 --> 31:54.339
- Of course.

31:54.339 --> 31:56.780
I'm so sorry to have barged in.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.580
- Which parking lot are you in?

31:59.995 --> 32:02.540
- [Abbey] Where are you going?

32:02.540 --> 32:05.383
Well, he's not going to
Greg's house, that's obvious.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.416
What is he doing over here?

32:29.292 --> 32:30.125
What?

32:32.073 --> 32:33.049
Oh no...

32:33.049 --> 32:33.882
No, no.

32:38.365 --> 32:42.290
I mean, it's not like he can get a gun.

32:42.290 --> 32:43.123
Right?

32:58.723 --> 33:01.573
All right, well, it's on.

33:02.510 --> 33:05.973
I can't figure out how to
do the "record" thingy.

33:10.040 --> 33:13.863
Spy camera number one; kitchen cam.

33:18.260 --> 33:22.460
Okay, so kitchen cam is
housed in this nifty little

33:23.580 --> 33:25.940
electrical outlet thingy.

33:25.940 --> 33:29.053
Kitchen cam, meet living room cam.

33:30.770 --> 33:33.510
Looks like a normal digital
picture frame, right?

33:33.510 --> 33:36.210
Except, see that little
pinhole right there?

33:36.210 --> 33:38.010
That's actually a camera.

33:38.010 --> 33:39.250
The best part?

33:39.250 --> 33:40.623
It's motion activated.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.400
Same deal with the one I'm
putting in Jacob's room.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.480
Jacob cam.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.010
So these new cameras will let me see

33:48.010 --> 33:50.530
what Jacob's up to when I'm not home.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.613
Okay, here we go.

33:55.131 --> 33:58.881
(Skype call on laptop rings)

34:00.850 --> 34:02.300
Hi Dr. Arden.

34:02.300 --> 34:05.163
I'm sorry, I completely
lost track of time.

34:05.163 --> 34:06.478
- No worries.

34:06.478 --> 34:07.470
You remember me?

34:07.470 --> 34:09.260
- Of course, yeah!

34:09.260 --> 34:13.790
- I watched that clip you
sent; that video from Jacob.

34:13.790 --> 34:16.010
When did this start?

34:16.010 --> 34:17.303
This behavior?

34:18.793 --> 34:20.949
- When he was a baby.

34:20.949 --> 34:22.389
An infant.

34:22.389 --> 34:24.639
He didn't like to be touched

34:24.639 --> 34:28.313
so he'd just lay there screaming at me.

34:28.313 --> 34:31.370
I mean, I was always his mom, you know?

34:31.370 --> 34:33.699
His hero, his protector,

34:33.699 --> 34:37.960
but by the time he was 14 I
didn't know who he was anymore.

34:37.960 --> 34:41.489
- I understand he received
counseling at the time.

34:41.489 --> 34:44.373
- He's been in counseling
since he was seven years old.

34:45.770 --> 34:49.070
He was drawing these disturbing pictures

34:49.920 --> 34:53.520
with this baby with this knife

34:53.520 --> 34:56.139
and, I don't know, some kind of bloodbath.

34:56.139 --> 34:58.720
- Your mother mentioned that, yeah...

34:58.720 --> 35:00.338
Do you remember the
pictures you used to draw

35:00.338 --> 35:02.653
when you were a young girl, Abbey?

35:05.350 --> 35:06.670
- No.

35:06.670 --> 35:09.760
- Yeah, your mother, she
didn't want them in the house.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.473
- I'm sorry...
- What's that?

35:12.473 --> 35:15.510
- I was kinda hoping we
could just talk about Jacob.

35:15.510 --> 35:17.200
- Of course, of course.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.823
Was he ever diagnosed as CU?

35:21.780 --> 35:24.453
Callous and unemotional traits?

35:25.520 --> 35:27.180
- No.

35:27.180 --> 35:30.050
- Has he ever been hospitalized.

35:30.050 --> 35:32.810
- No, he's pretty much outsmarted

35:32.810 --> 35:34.363
every therapist he's ever had.

35:35.420 --> 35:36.840
- Do you think Jacob

35:36.840 --> 35:39.863
is really capable of harming you, Abbey?

35:41.770 --> 35:42.603
- I don't know.

35:44.023 --> 35:46.855
I mean, I keep having this crazy dream

35:46.855 --> 35:49.660
where I'm standing on a stool

35:49.660 --> 35:51.260
in the middle of the living room

35:52.202 --> 35:54.580
and there's something around my neck.

35:54.580 --> 35:57.140
Like a rope, but not a rope.

35:57.140 --> 35:58.283
Smoother than a rope.

36:00.468 --> 36:03.560
I've wet myself, I know that sounds crazy,

36:03.560 --> 36:05.880
but my pajama bottoms are wet.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.013
They're itchy.

36:09.394 --> 36:12.423
- How did you get up on that stool?

36:13.700 --> 36:14.533
- I don't know.

36:14.533 --> 36:17.483
All I know is that something has happened.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.970
He's done something really really bad.

36:21.970 --> 36:23.610
- [Dr. Arden] Who?

36:23.610 --> 36:24.443
- Jacob.

36:28.405 --> 36:29.853
And he's giggling,

36:30.930 --> 36:33.500
laughing like he's
proud of what he's done;

36:33.500 --> 36:34.720
he's won, somehow.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.223
Like the joke's on me.

36:37.114 --> 36:40.623
I just kinda wanna step off the stool.

36:41.790 --> 36:43.100
- Do you?

36:43.100 --> 36:44.490
- What?

36:44.490 --> 36:45.610
Oh, no.

36:45.610 --> 36:46.443
No.

36:46.443 --> 36:49.453
- I'd like you to consider, for a moment,

36:50.750 --> 36:54.583
that it's not Jacob who
put you up on that stool.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.760
- What?

36:56.760 --> 36:58.500
I put myself up there?

36:58.500 --> 36:59.840
I wrapped a cord around my own neck

36:59.840 --> 37:02.210
and strung myself from the ceiling?

37:02.210 --> 37:04.930
- Is there any chance that in this dream

37:04.930 --> 37:08.523
it was Jerry who put you up on that stool?

37:09.610 --> 37:10.443
- Seriously?

37:12.228 --> 37:16.400
- I don't want to rule out
any possibilities, that's all.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.770
- I can't believe this is happening.

37:17.770 --> 37:19.156
Of course this is happening.

37:19.156 --> 37:23.930
- The fact that Jacob just
turned 16 is significant, Abbey.

37:23.930 --> 37:27.800
That's the same age
that Jerry was when he--

37:27.800 --> 37:30.777
- Yeah, you know what, I get it.

37:30.777 --> 37:32.760
The last thing I need right now

37:32.760 --> 37:35.160
is someone else telling
me that I'm the problem.

37:36.270 --> 37:37.713
Fucking asshole.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.939
Fuck.

37:40.939 --> 37:44.022
(chip bag crinkling)

37:46.330 --> 37:47.260
(loud chewing)

37:47.260 --> 37:48.110
Look at the rest.

38:07.971 --> 38:08.804
Not bad.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.180
It looks like a smoke detector, right?

38:16.990 --> 38:18.183
Safety first.

38:19.150 --> 38:23.133
Okay, so it's Monday, 3:30-ish.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.410
It's smaller than his, I know,

38:28.410 --> 38:31.773
but when we moved it was his
turn to get the big closet.

38:32.660 --> 38:35.373
Hey, take a look at this.

38:35.373 --> 38:36.206
Eh?

38:38.950 --> 38:41.833
That, my friends, is a live feed.

38:43.800 --> 38:47.140
I couldn't figure out how to get you,

38:47.140 --> 38:49.890
mister nanny cam, to hook up.

38:49.890 --> 38:51.420
You're too old.

38:51.420 --> 38:53.760
You're incompatible or something.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.540
Don't take it personally.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.400
Yeah, see, look.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.000
That one went off 'cause
no one's in the living room

39:00.888 --> 39:02.093
or the kitchen.

39:03.700 --> 39:07.040
Now I think Jacob cam is
still recording, because,

39:07.040 --> 39:09.693
do you see that in there?

39:11.370 --> 39:16.370
That, my friends, is a
birthday present from dad.

39:16.550 --> 39:18.590
Belated, FYI.

39:18.590 --> 39:22.180
It is an aquarium with a couple of rats.

39:22.180 --> 39:24.080
I'm not joking, that's what he wanted.

39:32.384 --> 39:34.967
(child crying)

39:48.790 --> 39:51.170
We're supposed to be
getting him gym shorts

39:51.170 --> 39:54.083
and a 200 watt transformer,
whatever the hell that is.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.010
We've been at this store
all of five minutes

39:57.010 --> 39:58.260
and Jacob is already MIA.

39:59.944 --> 40:01.343
Surprise.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.080
Just show me the cover.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.750
- Greg's mom let him get
this when he was, like, 12.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.063
- Well I'm not Greg's mom.

40:11.667 --> 40:13.290
- What's with the drives?

40:13.290 --> 40:14.123
- Oh, um...

40:14.123 --> 40:15.780
For my photos.

40:15.780 --> 40:16.613
- What photos?

40:16.613 --> 40:17.446
- You know, for work.

40:17.446 --> 40:18.880
Real estate listings, open houses.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.120
This says 18 and over, Jacob.

40:20.120 --> 40:20.953
- What listings?

40:20.953 --> 40:22.440
You haven't sold a
property in like a year.

40:22.440 --> 40:23.320
- I can't let you get this.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.373
Get something else.

40:26.990 --> 40:28.113
- Like a PlayStation?

40:29.900 --> 40:32.400
- Actually, I was thinking
maybe instead of paying me back

40:32.400 --> 40:35.590
we could work out a
different kind of deal.

40:35.590 --> 40:36.887
- [Jacob] Like what?

40:36.887 --> 40:37.720
- I don't know.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.850
Maybe we could talk, have a conversation.

40:39.850 --> 40:41.923
- [Jacob] About what?

40:43.122 --> 40:45.280
- I don't know, anything.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.180
Whatever comes up.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.810
You know, 15 minutes a day
for like, I don't know,

40:49.810 --> 40:50.683
a week.

40:51.670 --> 40:52.503
- Five days?

40:53.510 --> 40:54.740
- Seven.

40:54.740 --> 40:55.573
- Four.

40:56.750 --> 40:57.703
- Fine, five.

41:00.170 --> 41:02.770
- How 'bout we have a
conversation right now

41:02.770 --> 41:05.883
for an hour and 15 minutes
and I get it back today?

41:07.480 --> 41:08.913
- Starting tomorrow, Jacob.

41:11.740 --> 41:12.830
Hey, honey, turn right.

41:12.830 --> 41:14.980
Your transformer thingy
should be in aisle four.

41:14.980 --> 41:16.070
What do you need it for anyway?

41:16.070 --> 41:17.440
Hey, can you slow down?

41:17.440 --> 41:19.770
- Conversation starts tomorrow, mom.

41:19.770 --> 41:20.843
- Oh c'mon, Jacob.

41:23.660 --> 41:26.500
- [Girlfriend] So you moved
here with your mom, right?

41:26.500 --> 41:27.333
- Yup.

41:28.790 --> 41:29.793
- Well, where's your dad?

41:31.410 --> 41:32.650
- That's enough.

41:32.650 --> 41:33.630
Your turn.
- C'mon.

41:33.630 --> 41:34.910
- How do you like being filmed?

41:34.910 --> 41:35.900
- Oh, come on.

41:35.900 --> 41:36.733
- [Jacob] How do you like it?

41:36.733 --> 41:38.240
Yo, I'm in the street, Jacob.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.390
(car horn blaring)
That's dangerous.

41:39.390 --> 41:41.140
Stop, I'm serious.

41:41.140 --> 41:41.973
Fucking dick.

41:43.810 --> 41:46.030
- No, I already uploaded all the footage

41:46.030 --> 41:47.940
on an external drive and I can't view it

41:47.940 --> 41:49.747
because I keep getting this
error message that says,

41:49.747 --> 41:51.327
"operation not allowed".

41:52.240 --> 41:53.603
I need what program?

41:54.582 --> 41:55.650
(laptop notification dings)

41:55.650 --> 41:57.770
You guys are real crooks, you know that?

41:57.770 --> 41:58.890
- [Jacob] Hi.

41:58.890 --> 42:00.520
- Jacob?

42:00.520 --> 42:01.460
- What's that?

42:01.460 --> 42:03.280
- [Abbey] I didn't say anything.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.300
- Your face keeps freezing.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.133
Can you hear me?

42:05.133 --> 42:05.966
- Yeah, I can hear you.

42:05.966 --> 42:06.799
Can you hear me?

42:06.799 --> 42:07.632
- [Jacob] What's that?

42:07.632 --> 42:09.440
- I said I can hear you fine.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.530
- Mom.

42:10.530 --> 42:11.363
- [Abbey] What?

42:11.363 --> 42:12.533
Why can't you hear me?

42:13.740 --> 42:14.863
- Gotcha.

42:15.750 --> 42:18.367
You thought this is a live feed, right?

42:18.367 --> 42:19.980
Here's a little tip.

42:19.980 --> 42:22.760
If you don't see your image in
the bottom right hand corner,

42:22.760 --> 42:23.593
it's not live.

42:23.593 --> 42:25.250
It's prerecorded.

42:25.250 --> 42:26.270
So even though it seems

42:26.270 --> 42:28.040
like we're having a
conversation right now,

42:28.040 --> 42:29.003
we're really not.

42:30.673 --> 42:31.506
Sike!

42:31.506 --> 42:32.533
I'm totally kidding.

42:32.533 --> 42:34.945
I'm using this new program Greg has.

42:34.945 --> 42:36.853
What's it called, dude?

42:37.903 --> 42:39.150
- What's what called?

42:39.150 --> 42:40.750
- This new program they're beta testing

42:40.750 --> 42:43.050
that's better than Google
Hangout or whatever.

42:44.321 --> 42:47.213
He said it's called "Smart
Chat for Idiots", I guess.

42:48.930 --> 42:49.763
Mom--

42:49.763 --> 42:50.853
- That's not funny.

42:50.853 --> 42:51.892
- [Jacob] Mom.

42:51.892 --> 42:52.725
- What?

42:53.860 --> 42:55.070
- Do you know why it's called that?

42:55.070 --> 42:56.260
- [Abbey] No, I don't.

42:56.260 --> 42:57.270
It's probably a spinoff

42:57.270 --> 42:58.820
from the whole "For Dummies" franchise.

42:58.820 --> 43:01.040
- Oh and guess what I'm doing right now.

43:01.040 --> 43:01.873
- I don't know.

43:01.873 --> 43:03.180
You're talking to me, sort of.

43:03.180 --> 43:04.760
- Eh, wrong, try again.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.300
- You're fucking with her, right?

43:06.300 --> 43:08.483
- The "F" word is not okay, Greg.

43:09.470 --> 43:10.303
Right mom?

43:11.750 --> 43:13.880
- Who are you messing with?

43:13.880 --> 43:15.080
Are you messing with me?

43:16.388 --> 43:17.570
- [Abbey] Jacob!

43:17.570 --> 43:19.223
- Jesus Christ!

43:19.223 --> 43:20.790
Fuck off.

43:20.790 --> 43:21.950
- I'm hanging up right now.

43:21.950 --> 43:23.450
- [Jacob] Topic number one.

43:23.450 --> 43:25.712
How many idiots can there
really be in this world?

43:25.712 --> 43:28.620
- And this does not count as
one of our conversations, FYI.

43:28.620 --> 43:29.734
- I mean, we've got Greg here.

43:29.734 --> 43:31.130
He's clearly an idiot.

43:31.130 --> 43:32.200
And then there's...

43:33.150 --> 43:34.050
Well, there's you.

43:35.520 --> 43:37.470
You're an ever bigger idiot than he is.

43:38.440 --> 43:41.240
Because even though I actually
told you this wasn't live,

43:41.240 --> 43:43.680
that it couldn't be unless
you saw your own image

43:43.680 --> 43:44.980
in the bottom right hand corner,

43:44.980 --> 43:48.270
you're still talking back
to this prerecorded video,

43:48.270 --> 43:49.103
aren't you?

43:50.940 --> 43:52.160
Sorry to break it to you, mom,

43:52.160 --> 43:55.080
but the only part of "Smart
Chat for Idiots" that's real

43:55.080 --> 43:56.303
is the idiot part.

43:57.138 --> 43:58.250
And that would be...

44:02.440 --> 44:04.090
I bet there's a little part of you

44:04.090 --> 44:05.870
that still wants to believe this is live.

44:05.870 --> 44:06.703
Am I right?

44:10.377 --> 44:12.707
"Jacob is live."

44:12.707 --> 44:13.796
"Snapchat me."

44:13.796 --> 44:16.427
"I'm one of the cool moms."

44:18.220 --> 44:19.090
Well guess what.

44:20.206 --> 44:22.130
You'll never be one of the cool moms

44:22.130 --> 44:23.913
because you're a fucking idiot.

44:25.530 --> 44:27.860
One convo down, only four to go.

44:27.860 --> 44:29.910
So why don't we meet back here tomorrow?

44:29.910 --> 44:31.510
(Abbey pauses and resumes the video)

44:31.510 --> 44:33.091
Same time, same--

44:33.091 --> 44:35.430
(Abbey pauses and resumes the video)

44:35.430 --> 44:36.263
Place.

44:37.980 --> 44:38.843
You still there?

44:40.360 --> 44:41.193
You better be.

44:42.820 --> 44:45.550
Because I'm holding up
my end of the bargain.

44:45.550 --> 44:46.800
Because that was our deal

44:47.730 --> 44:52.730
and I want my fucking PlayStation back.

45:14.100 --> 45:15.280
Mom!

45:15.280 --> 45:16.370
- [Abbey] One sec!

45:16.370 --> 45:17.913
- You got another package!

45:21.272 --> 45:22.105
- What?

45:24.605 --> 45:25.455
What did you say?

45:26.410 --> 45:28.673
Oh, probably just my Eczema cream.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.940
- You should really be wearing your mitts.

45:37.460 --> 45:38.859
So what'd you think?

45:38.859 --> 45:40.250
- On what?

45:40.250 --> 45:41.293
- The video.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.910
- I thought it was mean.

45:44.910 --> 45:46.590
(Jacob laughs)

45:46.590 --> 45:47.710
- I totally got you.

45:47.710 --> 45:49.323
- It's not funny, Jacob.

45:50.424 --> 45:53.083
You called me an idiot
in front of your friend.

45:54.030 --> 45:55.257
- He's not my friend.

45:56.663 --> 45:58.340
- What do you mean?

45:58.340 --> 45:59.233
What happened?

46:02.700 --> 46:03.533
Jacob?

46:07.470 --> 46:08.670
- How many minutes left?

46:09.740 --> 46:10.913
- Don't be like that.

46:13.540 --> 46:14.373
Fine,

46:16.680 --> 46:19.093
fifteen starting now.

46:20.500 --> 46:21.333
- Cheater.

46:23.870 --> 46:26.483
Volt 100, meet mom.

46:27.750 --> 46:29.313
Or maybe this is Volt 200.

46:31.470 --> 46:32.860
- [Abbey] So what happened
with you and Greg?

46:32.860 --> 46:34.070
- Nothing.

46:34.070 --> 46:35.710
- [Abbey] Can we just talk for a minute?

46:35.710 --> 46:36.683
- We are talking.

46:38.920 --> 46:40.630
What's that thing?

46:40.630 --> 46:43.713
Um, I just thought I'd
put some pictures up.

46:44.720 --> 46:45.980
So what happened with you and Greg?

46:45.980 --> 46:47.960
- Is that on a digital loop or something?

46:47.960 --> 46:49.540
- Digital what?

46:49.540 --> 46:50.660
Can you stop doing that?

46:50.660 --> 46:52.060
Stop pivoting.

46:52.060 --> 46:52.893
Just talk to me.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.690
What happened with you and Greg?

46:54.690 --> 46:56.510
Did you guys have a fight or something?

46:56.510 --> 46:57.520
- Doesn't matter.

46:57.520 --> 46:59.397
- Of course it matters,
he's your best friend.

46:59.397 --> 47:00.720
- No, he's not.

47:00.720 --> 47:03.780
He's a lowlife circumcised douche bag.

47:03.780 --> 47:04.613
- What?

47:04.613 --> 47:06.760
- How many photos are in this thing?

47:06.760 --> 47:08.470
- I don't know, twelve, maybe?

47:08.470 --> 47:10.050
- Who took this one at the beach?

47:10.050 --> 47:11.130
Dad?

47:11.130 --> 47:11.963
- Probably.

47:11.963 --> 47:13.521
Jacob, what do you mean by circumcised?

47:13.521 --> 47:14.720
- He's even a shitty photographer.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.631
- Jacob!

47:15.631 --> 47:16.464
- I don't know, mom.

47:16.464 --> 47:18.480
Circumcised, like they cut
the tip of his dick off.

47:19.715 --> 47:20.893
- So?

47:20.893 --> 47:22.093
- So he's a fucking Jew.

47:23.359 --> 47:24.192
- So?

47:25.290 --> 47:27.970
- I totally remember those gay pajamas.

47:27.970 --> 47:29.710
- Jacob, what do you
care if Greg is Jewish?

47:29.710 --> 47:31.810
- Why do you get to ask all the questions?

47:33.320 --> 47:35.190
So how come my inheritance is contingent

47:35.190 --> 47:37.060
on me going to college?

47:37.060 --> 47:38.110
Doesn't Nana know by now

47:38.110 --> 47:39.660
that college is a total waste of time?

47:39.660 --> 47:41.350
What did you major in, again?

47:41.350 --> 47:42.433
Psychology?

47:43.600 --> 47:45.480
- [Abbey] What's your point, Jacob?

47:45.480 --> 47:48.180
- Hasn't it ever occurred to
you that college is just a scam

47:48.180 --> 47:52.110
perpetuated by none other
than, well, dumbfuck parents?

47:52.110 --> 47:52.943
- [Abbey] Jacob...

47:52.943 --> 47:53.890
- Isn't it a little strange

47:53.890 --> 47:56.520
that right before a kid turns 18,

47:56.520 --> 47:57.353
right when their parents

47:57.353 --> 47:59.380
still have legal authority over them

47:59.380 --> 48:01.460
happens to coincide with the exact age

48:01.460 --> 48:03.900
of your average would-be freshman?

48:03.900 --> 48:07.220
Right in that unbelievably
little convenient pocket of time,

48:07.220 --> 48:11.420
kids get coerced by their own
parents into a nationwide,

48:11.420 --> 48:14.453
bonafide, institutionalized Ponzi scheme.

48:16.350 --> 48:18.257
Wow, you look shit faced in that one.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.993
- [Abbey] Wanna know why I
think you should go to college?

48:28.430 --> 48:30.180
'Cause I think you're really smart.

48:31.449 --> 48:33.320
- So what do I need college for?

48:33.320 --> 48:36.060
- Because it's a great place to, you know,

48:36.060 --> 48:37.090
figure out what you're good at,

48:37.090 --> 48:38.490
what you want to do in life.

48:39.540 --> 48:41.210
- Total propaganda.

48:41.210 --> 48:42.440
I already know what I'm good at.

48:42.440 --> 48:43.910
- Yeah?

48:43.910 --> 48:45.310
What are you good at, Jacob?

48:46.200 --> 48:47.820
- You don't know?

48:47.820 --> 48:49.310
- [Abbey] I think you're
good at a lot of things.

48:49.310 --> 48:50.897
- Name one.

48:50.897 --> 48:53.260
- [Abbey] Well I think
your good at science.

48:53.260 --> 48:54.840
- Not according to Mr. Fuckner.

48:54.840 --> 48:56.210
- [Abbey] Yeah, can we talk
about that for a minute?

48:56.210 --> 48:58.363
Why you got detention from Mr. Buckner?

49:00.030 --> 49:01.500
- You want a hint?

49:01.500 --> 49:02.333
- [Abbey] No, Jacob.

49:02.333 --> 49:03.850
I don't want a hint,
I want you to tell me.

49:03.850 --> 49:05.180
- Ow, fuck!

49:05.180 --> 49:06.350
It fucking bit me!

49:06.350 --> 49:07.183
- [Abbey] Oh my god, honey.

49:07.183 --> 49:08.016
Let me see!
- Ow, ow, ow!

49:08.016 --> 49:09.590
My finger, it's bleeding everywhere.

49:09.590 --> 49:10.423
- [Abbey] I can't see.

49:10.423 --> 49:11.787
Which finger?

49:15.037 --> 49:15.870
- Gotcha.

49:18.800 --> 49:19.633
See mom.

49:19.633 --> 49:20.913
I'm good at psychology.

49:21.900 --> 49:23.400
I don't need a fucking degree.

49:28.050 --> 49:29.773
- What is wrong with you?

49:29.773 --> 49:32.440
(timer beeping)

49:34.270 --> 49:35.463
- Mom, your alarm.

49:37.400 --> 49:40.823
- [Abbey] For your information,
Nana's mother was Jewish.

49:41.830 --> 49:43.483
So technically, you're a Jew too.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.280
- Seriously, can you shut it off?

49:46.280 --> 49:47.730
It's really fucking annoying.

49:57.534 --> 50:00.201
(phone ringing)

50:13.960 --> 50:14.793
- Hello?

50:16.220 --> 50:17.690
Hi.

50:17.690 --> 50:19.193
Yes, I heard.

50:21.840 --> 50:22.673
What?

50:24.016 --> 50:24.849
Oh my god.

50:27.170 --> 50:28.083
Is Greg okay?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.330
Well, if he's too afraid
to admit Jacob did it,

50:34.330 --> 50:36.430
how am I supposed to talk to him about it?

50:38.400 --> 50:42.240
Well, no, I understand, but
maybe we should file a police--

50:44.720 --> 50:46.813
No, of course, I understand.

50:50.070 --> 50:51.793
Hey, maybe I could come by.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.333
No, sure.

50:56.490 --> 50:58.923
Look, I'm so sorry.

51:06.358 --> 51:09.525
The boys were playing with a gas mask.

51:10.520 --> 51:13.573
Someone put formaldehyde
in the air canister.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.233
Boys.

51:24.233 --> 51:25.110
Boys, boys, boys, stop!

51:25.110 --> 51:25.943
Jacob!

51:27.065 --> 51:28.460
You're not in trouble, sweetheart.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.710
She just doesn't want
you to throw it at her.

51:31.610 --> 51:33.193
Jacob, don't throw that at her.

51:33.193 --> 51:34.026
- No!

51:34.026 --> 51:34.859
- [Abbey] Don't throw it!

51:34.859 --> 51:35.692
Jacob--

51:41.740 --> 51:42.573
Hey.

51:42.573 --> 51:43.406
- What's on your face?

51:43.406 --> 51:44.840
You look like a freak.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.090
- [Abbey] So where you going?

51:46.090 --> 51:46.973
- Stalker.

51:48.210 --> 51:51.210
Listen, I think you should spend
this weekend with your dad.

51:52.310 --> 51:54.010
I bought you a bus ticket.

51:54.010 --> 51:55.655
- Fuck, mom, I'm 16.

51:55.655 --> 51:59.133
- 3:00 p.m. tomorrow,
you're on a bus to see dad.

52:14.724 --> 52:15.557
- Mom?

52:25.090 --> 52:26.520
- [TV] Launched a joint air strike

52:26.520 --> 52:29.740
with the United States
and France against Syria.

52:29.740 --> 52:32.314
White Power marched through
the streets of Charlottesville

52:32.314 --> 52:34.893
without hoods and without shame.

52:37.468 --> 52:40.573
This is the largest national
rally in over two decades.

52:40.573 --> 52:43.970
There's a lot more of us
than this country realizes

52:43.970 --> 52:45.070
and we're done hiding.

52:46.210 --> 52:47.123
Did you see that?

52:47.123 --> 52:48.200
They maced me.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.076
This is war!

52:49.076 --> 52:50.794
We'll kill these people if we have to.

52:50.794 --> 52:54.010
(screaming on TV)

52:54.010 --> 52:58.720
Perfect storm of easy access
to guns, ongoing cuts and--

53:53.883 --> 53:56.580
- Yes, yes, I am spying on my son.

53:56.580 --> 53:58.280
I never told him about my brother.

54:01.490 --> 54:03.620
I never told him about Jerry.

54:03.620 --> 54:04.860
(imitates gunshot)

54:04.860 --> 54:05.693
- [Girlfriend] Weirdo.

54:05.693 --> 54:07.980
- Standing on a stool in the
middle of the living room

54:07.980 --> 54:10.813
and there's something around my neck.

54:11.910 --> 54:13.410
What the fuck did he do to it?

54:15.000 --> 54:15.842
Jacob!

54:15.842 --> 54:16.842
Stop it now!

54:18.505 --> 54:19.631
What if it's genetic?

54:19.631 --> 54:23.631
- [Little Girl] (screaming) No!

54:25.400 --> 54:29.563
- The boy who cried wolf got
eaten by the fucking wolf.

54:30.880 --> 54:31.727
- [Greg] Dude, go, go!

54:31.727 --> 54:34.727
(imitating gunshot)

54:37.010 --> 54:37.843
- Jacob cam.

54:37.843 --> 54:38.890
- Remember me?
- Jerry.

54:40.870 --> 54:42.373
My name is Abbey.

54:45.480 --> 54:47.080
I think my 16 year old son

54:49.720 --> 54:50.713
is a psychopath.

55:09.584 --> 55:14.584
- Well, actually, he's at his dad's.

55:15.330 --> 55:17.273
I told you, Frank was fine with it.

55:19.350 --> 55:21.180
He's not missing any school.

55:21.180 --> 55:22.240
It's Friday.

55:22.240 --> 55:25.159
That's him on the other
line, I gotta call you back.

55:25.159 --> 55:25.992
No, Frank.

55:27.530 --> 55:30.070
Mom, I didn't dump him on anyone, okay?

55:30.070 --> 55:31.670
Can you give me a fucking break?

55:32.730 --> 55:33.563
Hello?

55:34.412 --> 55:35.245
Shit...

55:45.532 --> 55:47.782
(rumbling)

55:51.060 --> 55:51.893
Hello?

56:03.457 --> 56:04.290
Hello?

56:07.381 --> 56:10.048
(phone ringing)

56:15.940 --> 56:17.448
Hey, Frank, sorry about that.

56:17.448 --> 56:18.448
I was just--

56:19.467 --> 56:20.503
What do you mean?

56:22.080 --> 56:24.793
No, I dropped him off
at the station at 2:45.

56:26.600 --> 56:27.433
Fairview.

56:29.230 --> 56:31.300
Well did you actually
go down and pick him up

56:31.300 --> 56:32.133
or did you just--

56:32.133 --> 56:33.690
(loud bang and screaming)

56:33.690 --> 56:34.523
Hold on.

56:38.000 --> 56:38.833
Jacob!

56:39.670 --> 56:41.170
- [TV] See, if I was surrounded

56:41.170 --> 56:42.500
by six or eight of these things,

56:42.500 --> 56:43.890
would I stand a chance with them?

56:43.890 --> 56:45.050
Well there's no problem.

56:45.050 --> 56:46.506
If you have a gun,
shoot them in the head--

56:46.506 --> 56:47.407
- No, I don't know, it's just...

56:47.407 --> 56:51.157
The television just went
off for some reason.

56:52.157 --> 56:53.760
Just bear with me, Frank.

56:53.760 --> 56:54.593
Don't hang up.

56:59.780 --> 57:00.613
Jacob!

57:06.739 --> 57:08.360
(loud rap music plays)

57:08.360 --> 57:09.193
Yeah, he's here.

57:14.196 --> 57:15.601
Turn it down.

57:15.601 --> 57:16.434
- What?

57:16.434 --> 57:17.933
- Your stereo, turn it down.

57:21.419 --> 57:23.240
He's supposed to be with you...

57:23.240 --> 57:24.073
Frank.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.233
- Hello?

57:28.280 --> 57:29.113
Obviously.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.353
Oh really?

57:32.353 --> 57:33.780
On a scale of 1 to 10, what's scarier?

57:33.780 --> 57:35.410
Me not calling or mom
standing in front of me

57:35.410 --> 57:37.346
with a butcher knife?

57:37.346 --> 57:38.569
- It's not a butcher knife.

57:38.569 --> 57:40.376
It's not a butcher knife!

57:40.376 --> 57:42.807
I was making a salad; it's a salad knife.

57:42.807 --> 57:43.640
- Jesus...

57:43.640 --> 57:45.730
Can we have some privacy, please?

57:45.730 --> 57:46.563
Dad?

57:48.090 --> 57:48.923
- Shit.

57:53.322 --> 57:54.267
Define "privacy".

57:55.811 --> 57:57.050
Butcher knife.

57:57.050 --> 57:57.883
Please.

58:01.180 --> 58:02.430
- I don't know.

58:05.545 --> 58:06.378
- Shit.

58:13.464 --> 58:14.762
- Oh my god, yes.

58:14.762 --> 58:17.567
I know, but, y'know, she's my mom.

58:19.453 --> 58:20.703
- Unbelievable.

58:23.080 --> 58:26.640
Jacob's saying he didn't
want to leave me alone.

58:26.640 --> 58:28.690
That he was worried I might "freak out".

58:31.802 --> 58:32.635
Oh shit.

58:33.673 --> 58:35.008
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

58:35.008 --> 58:40.008
No...

58:46.210 --> 58:48.110
Look, I know I shouldn't
have pawned him off

58:48.110 --> 58:49.260
on his dad for the weekend,

58:49.260 --> 58:52.434
but I just needed to clear
my fucking head, okay?

58:52.434 --> 58:53.690
It's not like I can turn him in.

58:53.690 --> 58:55.770
He'd probably say the
lizards were already dead

58:55.770 --> 58:58.233
and he was just doing
a science experiment.

58:59.180 --> 59:01.969
You know Greg is never gonna rat him out.

59:01.969 --> 59:03.930
Pun intended.

59:03.930 --> 59:05.280
So what does that leave me?

59:06.375 --> 59:07.975
I just wish I could talk to him.

59:09.066 --> 59:11.033
But he doesn't know how to talk.

59:12.440 --> 59:13.653
He never really learned.

59:17.180 --> 59:21.800
If you can still talk
to your son, talk to him

59:22.700 --> 59:25.623
before he hates you for
allowing him not to.

59:29.680 --> 59:30.780
I mean, let's face it.

59:33.280 --> 59:35.730
Even if I could turn him
in, I probably wouldn't.

59:38.190 --> 59:40.340
For the same millions
of reasons you can't.

59:41.240 --> 59:42.073
Y'know?

59:42.970 --> 59:47.970
One more school, one more
semester, one more doctor.

59:49.700 --> 59:50.723
One more chance.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.293
Jacob?

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.313
Can we talk?

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.403
I wanna talk.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.343
I wanna listen.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.733
Jacob...

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.203
Sweetheart, you still have my phone.

01:00:42.779 --> 01:00:45.446
(Abbey snoring)

01:01:48.244 --> 01:01:49.077
Jacob?

01:01:57.805 --> 01:01:58.638
Jacob?

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.733
Jacob.

01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:13.210
Unlock the door!

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.043
Jacob!

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:19.630
You think this is funny?

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:20.863
Unlock the fucking door.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:29.890
Oh no, no, no...

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.593
Oh fuck...

01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:37.041
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck...

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:39.943
Okay.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:47.663
Jacob, honey.

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.780
Okay, I understand you're
upset about the, you know,

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:57.780
about the cameras, but I
didn't show anything to anyone.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:00.690
I promise, okay?

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:03.483
So just unlock the door, okay?

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.653
I'm not mad.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.613
I won't be mad.

01:03:10.843 --> 01:03:11.676
Damn it!

01:03:12.801 --> 01:03:13.634
Damn it!

01:03:24.132 --> 01:03:26.083
You think your mother's stupid?

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.420
You think I'm stupid?

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:29.253
Fuck you...

01:03:30.271 --> 01:03:31.104
All right.

01:03:38.588 --> 01:03:39.608
Let's see if we just--

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:42.191
(electric zap)

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:53.325
(heavy metal plays outside of room)

01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:17.442
Jacob!

01:04:19.498 --> 01:04:20.331
Jacob!

01:04:24.497 --> 01:04:25.330
Jacob!

01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:31.917
Jacob!

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.811
- Sorry about the whole chair thing.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.483
It's for your own protection.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.353
Volt 100 tried to escape too.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.150
Three times, to be exact.

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:53.350
I haven't figured out
the exact voltage yet.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.152
Didn't wanna risk it

01:04:56.152 --> 01:04:57.103
for your sake.

01:05:00.194 --> 01:05:02.233
I like your movie!

01:05:04.183 --> 01:05:05.340
I'm not crazy about where you were going

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:06.630
with the ending, though.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:10.060
I mean, where were you going with it?

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.383
Did you really think
I'd shoot up my school?

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:14.903
So lame.

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:18.440
We can do better than that.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.223
So here's the deal, mom.

01:05:23.137 --> 01:05:26.065
Mom!

01:05:26.065 --> 01:05:26.898
Mom.

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.220
Good.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.710
I've cloned your screen, FYI.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:33.970
And everything in your room is hot

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.193
so I wouldn't try anything stupid, okay?

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:38.863
Nod or something.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.770
Good.

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:45.410
So this might be very
hard for you to believe

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:47.800
but I'm actually not a psychopath.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.013
I mean, if I was, don't you
think you'd be dead by now?

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:54.980
And for your information,

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.340
I legally can't be
diagnosed with anything more

01:05:57.340 --> 01:05:59.423
than sociopathic tendencies.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.610
Under 18.

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:02.510
Brain's...

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:04.980
Still developing.

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:09.830
Of course, Jerry was 16 too,

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:12.263
so technically he wasn't
a psychopath either.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.040
But seven kids...

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:18.433
That's jacked up.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.853
The internet doesn't keep secrets, mom.

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.760
So here's what's going to happen next;

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.510
I'm going to come in there.

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:33.270
I'm going to remove your gag,

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:35.040
you're not going to say anything.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.920
You're not even gonna open your mouth.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.973
Got it?

01:06:40.514 --> 01:06:42.110
Then I'm going to untie your hands

01:06:42.110 --> 01:06:43.550
and you're going to use this

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:47.263
to record a new ending to the movie.

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.033
Part one.

01:06:52.097 --> 01:06:53.577
"My name is Abbey.

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.527
"I'm 42 years old.

01:06:55.527 --> 01:06:59.227
"I'm a single mom and my
son is not a psychopath."

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.173
You have to really mean it, mom.

01:07:04.317 --> 01:07:06.560
"I'm the one with problems".

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.030
Pause; you have to pause after that part.

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:12.307
You have to really reflect for a minute.

01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:16.470
"I'm the one who needs help."

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:17.740
Pause again.

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.380
I mean if you could
get a little teary-eyed

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.363
for this next part, that would
totally, totally sell it.

01:07:23.257 --> 01:07:25.523
"I'm the one who told Jerry to do it.

01:07:27.617 --> 01:07:28.977
"I'm the psychopath."

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.640
Think you can do that?

01:07:36.399 --> 01:07:38.110
- Somebody help!

01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:40.040
- Sorry, but that's the deal, mom.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.520
Non-negotiable.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.820
Then you turn the camera off,
I tie your hands back up,

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.100
I go into the other room and
I play back the recording,

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.598
and if I like it, if you do a really

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:53.410
really good job with it,
then I upload the footage

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:56.030
to a protected cloud server and you,

01:07:56.030 --> 01:07:57.680
you get to come out of your room!

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:01.620
I'm gonna delete the other footage.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.163
Or most of it, anyway.

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.450
And if you ever mess with me again

01:08:07.590 --> 01:08:10.040
you'll be the one in a
fucking diversion program.

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.983
Cool?

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:22.233
Memorize it.

01:08:30.745 --> 01:08:32.731
(floor creaking)

01:08:32.731 --> 01:08:35.981
(door handle rattling)

01:08:58.848 --> 01:09:02.348
(Jacob breathing heavily)

01:09:17.055 --> 01:09:17.889
- Jacob.

01:09:19.048 --> 01:09:20.215
Jacob, please.

01:10:05.943 --> 01:10:07.283
My name is Abbey.

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:10.913
I'm 42 years old.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:17.470
I'm a single mom and my son...

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.393
My son is not a psychopath.

01:10:27.149 --> 01:10:29.399
I'm the one who needs help.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.760
I'm the one who told him...

01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:37.373
Who told Jerry to do it.

01:10:42.091 --> 01:10:43.674
I'm the psychopath.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.723
- Out-fucking-standing.

01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.940
Arms.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.751
- Jacob, please.

01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:03.590
- Arms.

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:05.260
- You have what you want.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.045
I'm not gonna tell anybody,
just let me sit here

01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:08.540
until you come back, okay?

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:09.573
- Final warning.

01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.590
- Jacob, you said that was part one.

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:13.423
What's part two?

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:15.983
No!

01:11:15.983 --> 01:11:16.816
No!

01:11:16.816 --> 01:11:17.853
No!

01:11:17.853 --> 01:11:19.190
Stop it!

01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:20.170
What is that?

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:22.225
Jacob, stop it right now!

01:11:22.225 --> 01:11:25.725
(Jacob breathing heavily)

01:11:40.112 --> 01:11:42.195
- I didn't wanna do that.

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:46.450
Why did you make me do that?

01:11:53.386 --> 01:11:54.219
Shit.

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:59.129
I didn't wanna do that.

01:11:59.129 --> 01:11:59.962
I didn't...

01:11:59.962 --> 01:12:00.795
I didn't.

- Jacob.

01:13:37.055 --> 01:13:37.888
Jacob.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.440
I'm pretty sure you can
see me through this.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.973
When I turn it on, anyway.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.310
I don't see any other
cameras around here, so...

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:51.873
Listen, I just...

01:13:51.873 --> 01:13:55.250
I just wanted to tell you
that I know what I did

01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:57.363
was a really really shitty thing to do.

01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:00.213
And I'm sorry.

01:14:01.433 --> 01:14:02.266
I'm sorry.

01:14:05.673 --> 01:14:07.093
I made a mistake.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:09.863
Moms screw up sometimes.

01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:12.143
And I screwed up.

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.840
And I know I should have told you.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.590
I should have told you about Jerry.

01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:23.014
He was 16.

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:30.249
Papa bought him this car,

01:14:30.249 --> 01:14:33.000
this old beat up Mustang.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.610
Jerry used to take me out in it for rides

01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:39.050
with the windows down,
and the engine was so loud

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:41.653
it used to just drown out the whole world.

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:43.730
Nobody else existed.

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:46.763
Just him and me.

01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:50.320
We all knew he was hurting.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.340
He was keeping to himself a lot

01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:56.643
and his eyes changed.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.803
It's like they stopped looking.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.433
They stopped seeing.

01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:08.349
But you know, if you need
help, you ask for it.

01:15:08.349 --> 01:15:13.303
That's how it worked in my
family and he didn't ask.

01:15:15.916 --> 01:15:17.210
He didn't ask...

01:15:19.642 --> 01:15:23.480
Then one day he took a
shotgun down to Bridge Creek

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:27.570
where all the kids would
be making out in their cars

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.393
and no one knows why he did it.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.507
But all of a sudden he just
came flying out of that Mustang

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.053
and started shooting.

01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:44.093
Kids.

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.043
Classmates.

01:15:46.043 --> 01:15:47.798
Everybody; anybody.

01:15:47.798 --> 01:15:49.152
No reason.

01:15:49.152 --> 01:15:49.985
No reason.

01:15:49.985 --> 01:15:52.223
Just because he could.

01:15:54.909 --> 01:15:55.826
Seven kids.

01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:58.363
Seven.

01:16:00.867 --> 01:16:02.033
None of them survived.

01:16:04.524 --> 01:16:05.953
He blew them to pieces.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.230
And the thing is...

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:15.210
I didn't hate him so much

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:16.610
for killing those kids

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:21.350
as I did for putting a gun to his own head

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:26.900
before I had a chance to say goodbye...

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.303
Before I got one last
ride in that Mustang.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.013
Well...

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.490
I was just a kid...

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:47.573
Barely 12.

01:16:50.443 --> 01:16:52.573
But the thing is, honey,

01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:55.243
sweetheart,

01:16:57.230 --> 01:16:59.213
you are nothing like him.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:05.043
You are nothing like Jerry.

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:10.773
You couldn't kill anybody, Jacob.

01:17:12.857 --> 01:17:15.143
I know that; I know you can't.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.360
You're not capable of it.

01:17:19.413 --> 01:17:21.713
I don't believe that you are.

01:17:24.859 --> 01:17:27.276
I don't believe that you are.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.663
(Abbey crying)

01:17:38.378 --> 01:17:39.878
I love you, honey.

01:17:42.435 --> 01:17:44.185
Your mommy loves you.

01:17:45.264 --> 01:17:46.097
I do.

01:17:48.699 --> 01:17:49.949
I'm so sorry...

01:17:53.988 --> 01:17:55.071
I'm so sorry.

01:17:58.962 --> 01:17:59.795
Okay...

01:18:26.739 --> 01:18:27.572
Jacob.

01:18:30.589 --> 01:18:32.756
Jacob, honey, I'm thirsty.

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:36.920
Your mother needs some water.

01:18:40.418 --> 01:18:41.493
I'll, um...

01:18:43.273 --> 01:18:45.173
I'll turn my back to the door.

01:18:55.091 --> 01:18:57.841
(electrical zap)

01:19:10.259 --> 01:19:13.426
(hysterical laughing)

01:19:20.819 --> 01:19:23.736
Please don't take my sunshine away.

01:19:35.903 --> 01:19:38.236
(screaming)

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.358
What do you want from me?

01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.224
- [Jacob] Hey, Nana!

01:20:05.224 --> 01:20:08.117
Yeah, yeah, mom's just taking a nap.

01:20:08.117 --> 01:20:10.891
I'm sorry, I gotta run.
- Help!

01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:11.724
Help!

01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:15.411
Somebody help me!

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:16.741
He's gonna kill me!

01:20:16.741 --> 01:20:18.851
He's gonna fucking kill me!

01:20:18.851 --> 01:20:20.041
Help me!

01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:21.239
Help!

01:20:21.239 --> 01:20:23.122
Help, please, help me!

01:20:23.122 --> 01:20:24.177
Help me!

01:20:24.177 --> 01:20:25.620
Mom!

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.520
- [Jacob] That was really stupid, mom.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.393
- Jacob.

01:20:33.281 --> 01:20:34.114
Jacob.

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.160
Jacob, you have to stop this right now.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.890
How long have I been in here?

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.660
How long have I fucking
been in here, god damn it?

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.503
- Part two.

01:20:53.024 --> 01:20:55.107
- I'm not gonna say that.

01:20:56.474 --> 01:20:58.960
I'm not gonna say that.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.900
- [Jacob] I'm warning you.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:00.950
- No!

01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:02.023
I'm warning you!

01:21:04.012 --> 01:21:07.191
Is this what you want?

01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:09.570
Is this how you want your movie to end?

01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:10.820
- That's gonna hurt, mom.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:15.573
Go ahead.

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:18.130
It's not gonna kill you.

01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:19.539
It'll just, you know...

01:21:19.539 --> 01:21:22.456
(imitates buzzing)

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:29.390
You're making this a lot more
difficult than it has to be.

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:32.700
Turn the camera off,
turn the camera back on,

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:36.230
say your lines, turn the
camera back off again.

01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:37.260
That's it.

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.170
Ta-da!

01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:39.283
No more closet.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.240
- I don't believe you.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.110
- [Jacob] You're mumbling.

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:45.543
Talk into the camera.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.327
- I don't believe you.

01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:56.623
- Don't you get it?

01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:59.982
I'm trying to fucking help you.

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:03.340
You were never supposed to
be in the closet this long.

01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.345
That wasn't part of the plan!

01:22:04.345 --> 01:22:07.003
That was not part of the plan!

01:22:07.948 --> 01:22:08.781
Fuck...

01:22:13.031 --> 01:22:13.864
- Oh!

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:16.500
No!

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.960
Oh, baby...

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.320
Sweetheart, you're sick.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.153
You're sick...

01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:27.053
You need help; it's not your fault.

01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.273
It's not your fault.

01:22:30.308 --> 01:22:31.213
I can help you.

01:22:33.622 --> 01:22:35.951
Mommy can help you.

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:40.951
- You sure about that, mom?

01:23:02.923 --> 01:23:05.659
- [Abbey] (muffled) Somebody help me.

01:23:05.659 --> 01:23:06.492
Please...

01:23:08.153 --> 01:23:08.986
Help...

01:23:10.537 --> 01:23:11.370
Help!

01:23:12.383 --> 01:23:14.422
Somebody help me...

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:15.255
Help me?

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:18.425
Somebody?

01:23:19.922 --> 01:23:21.339
Somebody help me.

01:23:22.828 --> 01:23:23.661
Jacob...

01:23:24.601 --> 01:23:25.434
Jacob.

01:23:26.736 --> 01:23:27.569
Jacob.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.197
Let me out.

01:23:32.017 --> 01:23:33.100
Let me out...

01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.853
(distorted music)

01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:55.703
Jacob?

01:23:58.315 --> 01:23:59.148
Jacob?

01:23:59.989 --> 01:24:01.203
- Mom?

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:02.783
- Look at my hands.

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.810
Look at them.

01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:06.700
Why are they getting better?

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.750
Why are they healing?

01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:10.720
What were you putting in my meds?

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.743
Listen, I have to ask you.

01:24:21.825 --> 01:24:23.563
If I do this, if I say the lines,

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:26.640
you gonna kill me?

01:24:29.053 --> 01:24:30.793
- I'm not gonna kill you, Mom.

01:24:32.812 --> 01:24:34.112
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:37.003
You are.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.733
Part two.

01:24:42.927 --> 01:24:44.653
"Jacob's not going to kill me.

01:24:45.627 --> 01:24:47.313
"He's not going to kill anyone.

01:24:48.587 --> 01:24:49.420
"I am."

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.323
- Jacob's not gonna kill me.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.683
Jacob's not gonna kill anyone.

01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:13.663
I am.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.233
- Pretty pathetic, mom.

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:22.557
Might even be worse than
your bullshit melodramatic

01:25:22.557 --> 01:25:25.330
"Jerry never said goodbye" monologue.

01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:27.264
Follow the directions.

01:25:27.264 --> 01:25:32.264
Power off, power on, say
your lines, power off again.

01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:35.163
And sit up already,
you look like a zombie.

01:25:36.458 --> 01:25:38.153
- And then what?

01:25:38.153 --> 01:25:42.190
- Then I transfer the
footage and I set an alarm.

01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:43.240
When you hear the alarm,

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.340
that means you can come out of the closet.

01:25:46.436 --> 01:25:47.780
- And then what?

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.700
- I don't know, mom.

01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.400
I'll be at school by then.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.690
I mean, the most obvious choice

01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:53.840
would be to get up on
the stool and y'know.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.473
- Jacob.

01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:01.420
This movie is not gonna
end the way you want it to.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.620
- Oh really?

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.803
How's it going to end?

01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:08.793
- Jacob is going to let his
mother out of the closet.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.513
He thinks it's too late
for that, but it's not.

01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:17.363
And together, they are
going to erase the footage,

01:26:18.614 --> 01:26:19.803
all of it.

01:26:21.047 --> 01:26:22.090
- "They" are?

01:26:22.090 --> 01:26:22.923
Hm...

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.650
What a snooze fest.

01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:27.570
Okay, how 'bout this?

01:26:27.570 --> 01:26:29.800
How about Jacob threatens to do

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.730
exactly what his mother
always feared he would do,

01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:35.805
sort of like a
self-fulfilling prophecy or,

01:26:35.805 --> 01:26:37.510
what did you call it?

01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:39.240
A psychosomatic projection!

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.880
Dude, that's good, write that down.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:43.267
Okay, so Jacob says something like,

01:26:43.267 --> 01:26:44.100
"Hey, mom.

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.047
"Record your lines or I'm
gonna take a gun to school

01:26:46.047 --> 01:26:48.447
"and mow down the entire freshman class."

01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:53.670
C'mon, mom.

01:26:53.670 --> 01:26:56.040
You don't want those kids
to end up like Jerry's pals,

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:56.873
do 'ya?

01:26:58.216 --> 01:26:59.690
I'm totally kidding.

01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:01.780
Look, there's nothing
really to negotiate here.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.750
I mean we both know you're
gonna climb up on that stool.

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.050
I mean, how could you not?

01:27:08.547 --> 01:27:10.533
"I'm the one who told Jerry to do it.

01:27:10.533 --> 01:27:11.937
"I'm the psychopath."

01:27:15.223 --> 01:27:17.520
Of course, if you don't have
the balls to go through with it

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.553
you could always watch this
little video I made for you.

01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:28.130
Oh, and I'll have the drives
with me so don't even bother.

01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:32.663
Say your lines.

01:27:35.525 --> 01:27:36.513
Say your lines!

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:40.827
Mom, just say your lines.

01:27:40.827 --> 01:27:43.243
Say your fucking lines!

01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:47.940
- Jacob...

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.280
Jacob?

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.113
- Mom?

01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:55.630
You scared me.

01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:57.090
I thought you...

01:27:57.090 --> 01:27:59.430
I don't know, I thought
something happened or...

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:00.363
Are you okay?

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.593
Your camera is faced the wrong way.

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.820
- [Abbey] I'm not gonna do it.

01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:09.693
I'm not gonna say the lines.

01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:12.233
I'm sorry.

01:28:17.535 --> 01:28:18.793
- [Jacob] What the fuck?

01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:22.403
- I can't let you get away with this.

01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:25.480
- [Jacob] What are you doing?

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.313
Mom, stop.

01:28:26.313 --> 01:28:27.146
Don't!

01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:29.663
- Goodbye, Jacob.

01:28:29.663 --> 01:28:30.496
- Mom, don't--

01:28:30.496 --> 01:28:32.395
(electric zap)

01:28:32.395 --> 01:28:33.228
Mom?

01:28:34.211 --> 01:28:35.691
Mom?

01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:36.524
Fuck!

01:28:37.462 --> 01:28:38.487
Mom?

01:28:38.487 --> 01:28:39.990
Mom, mom, mom...

01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:42.680
Please, please, please...

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.219
Mom?

01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:47.308
(crying) Why did you do that?

01:28:47.308 --> 01:28:48.391
Okay, okay...

01:28:54.449 --> 01:28:55.282
Fuck!

01:29:03.003 --> 01:29:03.836
Fuck...

01:29:13.707 --> 01:29:15.124
Okay, okay, okay.

01:29:33.396 --> 01:29:34.229
Come on...

01:29:46.779 --> 01:29:50.529
(video call rings on laptop)

01:29:52.815 --> 01:29:53.898
Shit, shit...

01:29:54.863 --> 01:29:56.696
Think, think, think...

01:29:58.356 --> 01:29:59.189
Think!

01:30:05.890 --> 01:30:06.723
Nana!

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:09.590
Nana...

01:30:12.501 --> 01:30:14.374
Nana, uh...

01:30:14.374 --> 01:30:15.321
Nana.

01:30:15.321 --> 01:30:16.810
Na-na...

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:19.840
Something's wrong with mom.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.673
She, uh...

01:30:22.343 --> 01:30:23.906
She's...

01:30:23.906 --> 01:30:27.299
She's covered in wires
and something happened.

01:30:27.299 --> 01:30:28.700
Her body is...

01:30:30.538 --> 01:30:32.661
What the fuck is happening?

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:34.519
What the fuck is happening to me?

01:30:34.519 --> 01:30:37.229
What the fuck is happening to me?

01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:38.867
What the fuck is happening to me?

01:30:38.867 --> 01:30:41.117
What the fuck is happening?

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:16.334
(door squeals open)

01:31:17.961 --> 01:31:18.794
Mom?

01:31:21.293 --> 01:31:22.376
- [Abbey] Ah!

01:31:29.443 --> 01:31:31.925
(Jacob laughs)

01:31:31.925 --> 01:31:34.578
What's so fucking funny?

01:31:34.578 --> 01:31:37.333
- [Jacob] (gurgling) You're
the baby in the pictures!

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.875
You're the baby with the knife!

01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:42.935
- No I'm not.

01:31:42.935 --> 01:31:43.910
I'm not!

01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:45.590
I'm not the baby!

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:48.283
You're the fucking baby!

01:31:48.283 --> 01:31:52.033
(Jacob suffocating in blood)

01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:11.114
- [911 Operator] 911,
what's your emergency?

01:33:11.114 --> 01:33:11.947
911?

01:33:14.264 --> 01:33:15.597
Is anyone there?

01:33:18.245 --> 01:33:19.078
Hello?

01:33:20.304 --> 01:33:21.530
Hello?
