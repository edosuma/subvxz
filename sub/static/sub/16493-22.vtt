00:03.289 --> 00:06.039
[Melissa] Okay, Milo.
How about on a scale of one to ten?

00:06.123 --> 00:07.289
[Milo] I would rate this a six.

00:07.372 --> 00:09.580
[Melissa] I would say it's
at least a seven or eight.

00:09.664 --> 00:11.206
[Melissa] Wait, is ten
the best or the worst?

00:11.289 --> 00:15.580
[Zack] Uh, maybe we could rate this
adventure later, you know, if we survive.

00:15.664 --> 00:18.164
-And if we don't?
-Then we don't rate it.

00:18.248 --> 00:20.622
For now, can we just figure out
the surviving part?

00:20.706 --> 00:22.580
Well, we might be able to
llama our way out of this.

00:22.664 --> 00:24.414
Oh, just like
the llama incident.

00:24.497 --> 00:26.706
[laughs sarcastically]
Okay, that's it.

00:26.789 --> 00:29.580
You guys are always talking about
the llama incident.

00:29.664 --> 00:31.539
What is the llama incident?

00:31.622 --> 00:34.414
I don't think we're always
talking about it.

00:34.497 --> 00:37.206
Yeah, what conversations
would that even fit into?

00:37.289 --> 00:38.747
A lot.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.664
I would've had extras but you know,
the llama incident.

00:40.747 --> 00:42.747
Last time he came,
there was a llama stampede.

00:42.831 --> 00:46.831
My t-shirt launcher is still filled with
knockout gas from the llama incident.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.706
I've seen you walk a tightrope
over stampeding llamas.

00:49.789 --> 00:51.081
Llama incident.

00:51.164 --> 00:52.081
Llama incident.

00:52.206 --> 00:54.622
[both alternating]
Lla. Ma. In. Ci. Dent.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.622
[both] Llama incident.

00:57.706 --> 00:59.664
Well, we might be able to
llama our way out of this.

00:59.747 --> 01:01.789
Oh, just like
the llama incident.

01:01.872 --> 01:04.039
Oh, I hadn't realized
we talk about it so much.

01:04.123 --> 01:06.706
Looks like we're gonna have to let him
into the llama club, Milo.

01:06.789 --> 01:12.622
All right, then. Sit back, relax and get
ready to hear the llama story.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.289
Actually, don't sit back
because you'll fall to your doom.

01:15.372 --> 01:16.706
It was last fall.

01:16.789 --> 01:19.289
Melissa was stuck on a tightrope
over the football field.

01:19.372 --> 01:22.414
Milo, I can't do this much longer.
What's the plan?

01:22.497 --> 01:25.123
Not sure yet but
I'm working on it.

01:25.206 --> 01:28.039
Why are there all these llamas
at the football game?

01:28.123 --> 01:29.123
[groans]

01:29.206 --> 01:30.372
[Milo] And that was
the llama incident.

01:30.455 --> 01:33.455
Hold on. How did the llamas
wind up at the football game?

01:33.580 --> 01:35.039
Okay, let me back up.

01:35.123 --> 01:36.622
Back at the
turn of the century...

01:36.706 --> 01:39.164
-[Zack] Really? It starts in 1900?
-[Milo] No, this century.

01:39.248 --> 01:40.372
[Milo] The year 2000.

01:40.455 --> 01:41.998
[Zack] Oh, okay. Go on.

01:42.081 --> 01:45.164
[Milo] A man named Edwin Garner came into
a large inheritance.

01:45.248 --> 01:47.414
[Melissa] But the inheritance
wasn't money.

01:47.497 --> 01:50.081
What are these
llamas doing here?

01:50.164 --> 01:52.664
[in Boston accent] I told you, Uncle Irwin
left me the llama farm.

01:52.747 --> 01:53.831
Just not the farm part.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.539
[Zack] Stop. Stop there.

01:55.622 --> 01:57.747
Why does he have such a thick
Boston accent?

01:57.831 --> 02:00.330
-Oh, he was originally from Boston.
-Oh, okay.

02:00.414 --> 02:02.789
But I think you backtracked too far.
Jump ahead.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.539
Oh, okay. So, Garner bought
a little theater in town,

02:05.622 --> 02:07.330
a little 99-seat place,
Equity Waiver.

02:07.414 --> 02:09.747
Anyway, 15 years later
he had a whole string of them,

02:09.831 --> 02:13.497
and there was an avant garde play festival
using Garner's llamas in the cast.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.747
[Melissa] There were shows
like Hello Dolly Llama,

02:15.831 --> 02:19.206
Annie Get Your Llama,
Death of A Sales Llama.

02:19.289 --> 02:21.539
Some of the titles
were better than others.

02:21.622 --> 02:24.414
[Milo] " Llamalet, it's Hamlet
but with Llamas."

02:24.497 --> 02:26.123
Well, I guess that
quote says it all.

02:26.206 --> 02:28.414
I always confuse
camels and llamas.

02:28.497 --> 02:30.706
Are llamas furry?
Or is their skin like a briefcase?

02:30.789 --> 02:32.706
Furry. Neither is like a briefcase.

02:32.789 --> 02:34.164
I wonder what
I'm thinking of.

02:34.248 --> 02:36.497
-A briefcase?
-That's it.

02:36.580 --> 02:38.580
[Melissa] So, we're at
Garner's theater,

02:38.664 --> 02:40.706
and all things considered,
the play was going pretty well.

02:40.789 --> 02:42.539
Hamlet had just
asked for forgiveness

02:42.622 --> 02:45.164
but Laertes wasn't
having any part of it.

02:45.289 --> 02:46.872
I think.

02:46.956 --> 02:50.081
And I thought it was hard to understand
Shakespeare in human.

02:50.164 --> 02:52.831
[Melissa] That's right around
where Murphy's Law kicked in.

my backpack back.

04:29.956 --> 04:32.872
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
What's with the polar bear?

04:32.956 --> 04:35.330
And how did you get from the glacier
to the football game?

04:35.414 --> 04:38.664
Well, we couldn't just
leave those llamas on the iceberg.

04:38.747 --> 04:42.289
So, I used my t-shirt cannon to shoot
knockout gas at the polar bear,

04:42.372 --> 04:44.831
which we used to frighten the llamas
in a southerly direction.

04:44.914 --> 04:47.539
From there, it was a simple matter
of a dog sled,

04:47.622 --> 04:49.956
seaplane and public bus system
back to town.

04:52.956 --> 04:54.539
Okay, mission accomplished.

04:54.622 --> 04:56.580
We just have to get
these quadruped thespians

04:56.664 --> 04:58.497
back to their respective theaters.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.706
But they seemed confused
and unmotivated.

05:00.789 --> 05:01.998
How do you
motivate a llama?

05:02.081 --> 05:03.956
Well, we could lure them with pistachios.

05:04.039 --> 05:04.872
Pistachios?

05:04.956 --> 05:06.831
Didn't you know that
llamas love pistachios?

05:06.914 --> 05:07.831
You're asking me?

05:07.914 --> 05:09.872
I thought they had
skin like a briefcase.

05:09.956 --> 05:12.455
[Dakota] Who knew pistachio
gelatin was so heavy?

05:12.539 --> 05:14.872
Who knew pistachio gelatin existed?

05:14.956 --> 05:17.539
I could've sworn I had some pistachios
in here, somewhere.

05:20.664 --> 05:22.039
[bird chirping]

05:24.789 --> 05:27.497
Hey, I found them.
Oh, that works, too.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.372
Milo, what do I do?

05:30.455 --> 05:33.372
[all grunting curiously]

05:33.455 --> 05:35.872
If I were you,
I'd probably run.

05:37.123 --> 05:39.872
-So, then you went to the football game?
-Let's see.

05:39.956 --> 05:42.664
Hamlet, ballet, graduation,

05:46.123 --> 05:48.580
Oh, right.
Got ahead of myself.

05:48.664 --> 05:51.789
So, Melissa ran as fast as she could, but
the llamas were closing in.

05:51.872 --> 05:53.747
She ran right into
the football stadium.

05:53.831 --> 05:54.872
Hey!

There you go,
one drum of cable.

06:42.497 --> 06:44.622
No, I said one
drum for Mabel.

06:44.706 --> 06:46.039
She left hers at home.

06:46.123 --> 06:49.580
Oh, I get it.
Drum of cable, drum for Mabel.

Boy, is my face red. I mean, they sound a
lot alike and then they rhyme and all,

but why would I think
you need a big drum of cable up here?

06:57.539 --> 07:01.039
And it was a lot of effort
getting it up these stairs.

07:12.872 --> 07:15.580
-Uh, branches.
-Pistachio trees.

07:15.664 --> 07:18.123
Yes, but the pistacia vera
is a very sturdy wood.

07:18.206 --> 07:21.081
That should give me enough time to tell
you about the seat belts.

Whatever you're doing,
do it better.

Whoa!

Oops, sorry.
I didn't mean to throw it that high.

07:59.998 --> 08:01.914

by all these llamas.

08:01.998 --> 08:05.123

What's the plan?

08:05.206 --> 08:07.831

I'm working on it.

08:07.914 --> 08:11.580
Why are there all these llamas
at the football game?

08:11.664 --> 08:15.164
[Milo] And that's basically it.
The llama story. The end.

08:15.248 --> 08:17.706
The end? What do you mean?

08:17.789 --> 08:19.539

into stampeding llamas.

That's how we started.

Oh, well, you know she got down because
she's right here.

08:23.497 --> 08:26.706
By that logic, the only stories you would
ever wanna hear

-Not great.

10:05.248 --> 10:07.123
I just got this job
and I already dropped

10:07.206 --> 10:09.580
three of these flesh colored bags
of red paint.

10:09.664 --> 10:11.248
Hope you're having
a better day than me.

10:11.330 --> 10:14.789
We sure are. A few minutes ago,
we were falling from a cliff.

10:14.872 --> 10:16.580
Whoa, how did you survive?

10:16.664 --> 10:19.998
