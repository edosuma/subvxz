Here is proof that I am for real.

00:04.577 --> 00:05.776
I quit Y.

00:05.778 --> 00:07.545
No, no, no. You need
to stay on your meds.

00:07.547 --> 00:09.614
"Side effects include brain zaps..."

00:09.616 --> 00:11.949
- What the hell is a brain zap?
- Oh!

00:11.951 --> 00:14.185
Somebody in the Austin
media family was murdered.

00:14.187 --> 00:16.821
My name is Malleck Ferguson,
and I deserve to die.

00:16.823 --> 00:17.922
Are we safe?

00:17.924 --> 00:20.691
They're extremists targeting men.

00:20.693 --> 00:23.361
My skin is so soft, hmm?

00:23.363 --> 00:24.800
It's very soft.

00:24.810 --> 00:27.344
Plum is one who could go
in the wrong direction.

00:27.346 --> 00:30.371
Open the door, Plum.

00:31.983 --> 00:34.823

think that's necessary, darling.</i>

00:38.056 --> 00:41.783
Listen, Tommy's about home,
so I should dash, but...

00:41.793 --> 00:43.552
She said what?

00:45.330 --> 00:46.922
Brilliant.

00:46.932 --> 00:50.225
Oh, what a sow that woman is.

00:50.235 --> 00:53.428
Well, swing round and get
me then, if you're worried.

00:53.438 --> 00:54.904
Half past?

00:57.409 --> 01:00.469
<i> I used to think of</i>

02:40.412 --> 02:42.671
I care if they're rapists.

Honey, you're not a Jennifer
sympathizer, are you?

02:44.883 --> 02:49.177
No! I just... I'm not losing
sleep over dead rapists.

I'm gonna be late.

03:15.580 --> 03:17.606
Oh, five minutes. Eat your breakfast.

03:17.616 --> 03:20.642
Mom, I can't. Sorry. I'm meeting people.

03:20.652 --> 03:23.311
What people? Calliope House people?

03:23.321 --> 03:25.580
Who are these people? Do you
really know what they want?

03:25.590 --> 03:27.649
You're not worried about
some feminist group

03:27.659 --> 03:29.751
just handing you a check for $20,000?

03:29.761 --> 03:31.586
They're not just handing it to me.

03:31.596 --> 03:34.322
Verena's not a terrorist.
There's no way.

03:34.332 --> 03:36.892
Probably not, but she's not
afraid to use tactics on you.

03:36.902 --> 03:40.562
This is not about Jennifer.
This is about money.

03:40.572 --> 03:43.231
Money I'll earn by letting
a well-meaning rich lady

03:43.241 --> 03:45.634
poke around inside my psyche
to make herself feel better.

03:45.644 --> 03:47.510
It's harmless.

03:49.915 --> 03:51.640
Shit. I have to go.

03:51.650 --> 03:53.742
I'll be back for dinner.

04:13.204 --> 04:16.164
<i> Formerly that girl from that dumb show.</i>

04:16.173 --> 04:20.267
<i>And me. Meeting my first-ever
famous person didn't feel real,</i>

04:20.278 --> 04:22.804
<i>more like I'd walked into
a show of my life.</i>

04:22.814 --> 04:24.172
OK, I've changed a little.

04:24.182 --> 04:26.382
I'm older... Aaah!

04:28.119 --> 04:30.478
My hair looks like a gray toothbrush.

04:30.488 --> 04:32.647
Ah, my weight. Whoo!

04:32.657 --> 04:34.349
It's up, it's down.

04:34.359 --> 04:35.817
But other than that,

04:35.827 --> 04:38.353
iiiiit's Marlowe!

<i>A show starring an older hippie version</i>

04:45.003 --> 04:46.361
- Aww...
- Yeah.

04:46.371 --> 04:47.896
Damn thing used to follow me

04:47.906 --> 04:52.300
every single time I would walk
into a living room.

04:52.310 --> 04:54.903
Oh, and I... buried the lede:

04:54.913 --> 04:57.372
I'm no longer bangable.

04:57.382 --> 04:59.349
Excuse me?!

05:01.152 --> 05:04.079
Well, I'm not.

05:04.089 --> 05:05.981
Which is why I left show business

05:05.991 --> 05:08.216
or why show business left me.

05:08.226 --> 05:10.585
We'll call it a draw.

05:10.595 --> 05:13.521
I didn't know the reason,
I just missed your show.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.361
Well, I went away to Italy on hiatus,

05:19.371 --> 05:24.065
and lopped off 20 inches
off my <i> Marlowe!</i> hairstyle.

05:24.075 --> 05:25.433
And that was the real killer.

05:25.443 --> 05:27.602
Yeah. Short hair.

05:27.612 --> 05:29.504
Shut up.

05:29.514 --> 05:32.073
Nobody cares about what you think.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.242
- There's no pleasing them.
- Mm.

05:34.252 --> 05:38.113
OK, your next task.

05:38.123 --> 05:40.048
Becoming bangable.

05:40.058 --> 05:43.785
It is not easy or fun,
but it is essential.

05:43.795 --> 05:47.589
I should know. I literally
wrote the book on it.

05:47.599 --> 05:49.624
I-I'm sorry, I don't understand.

05:49.634 --> 05:51.526
I have to have sex with someone?

05:51.536 --> 05:52.927
I didn't sign up for that.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.729
No, no, no.

05:54.739 --> 05:56.564
It's not about literal banging, silly,

05:56.574 --> 05:59.200
and it sure as hell is not about
what <i> you</i> want.

05:59.210 --> 06:00.869
It's about what <i> men</i> want.

06:08.219 --> 06:10.979
Read this. It'll explain everything.

06:10.989 --> 06:14.716
<i>As surreal as meeting
her was, Marlowe</i> was <i> real...</i>

06:14.726 --> 06:16.718
<i>And she was right in front of me,</i>

06:16.728 --> 06:19.054
<i>asking me to step
way out of my comfort zone.</i>

Private sector money now.

07:10.099 --> 07:11.901
All right, I'll get the drive

07:11.912 --> 07:13.979
You still looking for the same stuff?
Scrubbed files?

07:13.990 --> 07:15.787
Yeah, suspect's name is Alicia Kettle.

07:15.798 --> 07:18.307
It's probably nothing, just another
employee that fits the profile.

07:18.318 --> 07:20.818
Got it. How's the Austen gig?

07:20.828 --> 07:24.422
Ah, bullshit job, but money's good.

07:24.432 --> 07:25.664
Yeah?

07:27.835 --> 07:30.128
Christ. OK.

07:30.138 --> 07:31.704
Yeah.

07:35.443 --> 07:37.502
- Is it Jennifer?
- You don't want to know.

07:37.512 --> 07:39.270
It'll just piss you off.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.973
What, you afraid to tell me,
I'm gonna lose it?

07:41.983 --> 07:45.109
I thought at least you knew me
better than that.

07:45.119 --> 07:48.679
Look, some chick Googled "sex offenders"

07:48.689 --> 07:50.948
and found Travis Wiman
livin' in her building.

07:50.958 --> 07:53.050
What are you talkin' about?
He's at Rikers.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.652
He got out on appeal.

07:54.662 --> 07:56.988
Anyway, she just tried
to blow his dick off.

07:56.998 --> 08:00.792
She missed, unfortunately,
but I gotta go arrest her.

08:00.802 --> 08:02.168
Be good.

08:04.872 --> 08:06.664
So how'd Wiman get out?

08:06.674 --> 08:09.801
A technicality, like always.

08:09.811 --> 08:11.636
Right.

08:11.646 --> 08:13.738
So what, now every scumbag
I've ever put away

08:13.748 --> 08:15.807
is getting out saying
I'm some vigilante cop?

08:15.817 --> 08:18.209
The deal was I resign
and we put a lid on the story!

08:18.219 --> 08:21.045
I didn't say anything.
All right? You know that.

08:21.055 --> 08:23.748
But there are no secrets
anymore, not with screen grabs.

08:23.758 --> 08:26.818
And you know, inmates and cops,
they gossip like girls.

08:26.828 --> 08:28.171
Look, I gotta head out.

08:28.182 --> 08:30.054
You take care of yourself, Nicky.

08:30.064 --> 08:31.530
I'll tell him it's a rush.

08:43.778 --> 08:45.903
Was that somebody special?

08:45.913 --> 08:48.840
You had somebody-special face.

08:48.850 --> 08:50.708
- He's good-looking.
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.718 --> 08:53.219
That's probably all it is.

08:54.922 --> 08:56.388
Plum?

08:57.792 --> 09:00.518
The point of this...
Ah, short version...

09:00.528 --> 09:03.955
Fully experiencing the steps
to bangability,

09:03.965 --> 09:05.590
truly understanding them.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.958
And... pay attention...

09:06.968 --> 09:08.759
You need to know what it takes

09:08.769 --> 09:10.703
and what it takes <i> from</i> you.

09:31.292 --> 09:33.226

<i>they were talking about me.</i>

<i>She was probably warning Lilianna</i>

09:38.666 --> 09:41.459
<i>to stay alert or I'd eat them both.</i>

09:51.913 --> 09:54.138
<i>the insult or the injury?</i>

<i> You're not making</i>
<i>Daisy Chain eat this bullet.</i>

09:56.918 --> 09:59.277
What kind of message
would it send my girls...

09:59.287 --> 10:02.113
"When the going gets tough,
give in to extremists"?

10:02.123 --> 10:04.081
"Take it in the ass"?

10:04.091 --> 10:06.017
I reinvented <i> Daisy Chain.</i>

10:06.027 --> 10:09.987
I transformed Austen Media
from the typeface up.

10:09.997 --> 10:12.590
You want to print

10:12.600 --> 10:14.592

10:14.602 --> 10:16.794
- They call it a manifesto.
- Whatever.

10:16.804 --> 10:18.095
You know what I call it?

10:18.105 --> 10:20.131
Your. Problem.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.433
They sent an English publisher's <i> scalp</i>

10:22.443 --> 10:24.602
to his wife in a bubble envelope.

10:24.612 --> 10:26.704
What does that have to do with you?

10:26.714 --> 10:28.639
Were you a friend of his?

10:28.649 --> 10:32.710
Are you <i> men...</i> or babies? Hmm?

10:34.655 --> 10:37.548
Scared widdle babies.

10:51.906 --> 10:54.498
I mean, it's not the cute boy,
but still.

10:54.508 --> 10:57.068
Not yet. I need to be fortified.

10:57.078 --> 10:59.537
- Carbs or protein?
- Neither.

10:59.547 --> 11:01.005
I feel dizzy.

11:01.015 --> 11:02.640
I feel like I've been skinned.

11:02.650 --> 11:04.141
You have, honey.

11:04.151 --> 11:05.910
You're an animal without her fur.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.346
And that's what dudes want
in a bangable gal,

11:08.356 --> 11:10.170
they want the illusion of purity.

11:10.181 --> 11:12.316
Yeah, but it's like they're
making me pre-pubescent.

11:12.326 --> 11:13.485
Bingo.

11:13.496 --> 11:15.052
How many women have you done this to?

11:15.062 --> 11:17.054
Women do this to themselves every day.

11:17.064 --> 11:20.191
I know, but how many have <i> you</i> taken
through this New Baptist Plan?

11:20.201 --> 11:21.759
A very select few.

11:21.769 --> 11:23.761
And it's Verena's plan, by the way.

11:23.771 --> 11:26.430
I'm just doing my part.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.999
So, why are you avoiding your boss?

11:28.009 --> 11:31.502
She asked me to write
an article for publication.

11:31.512 --> 11:34.872
Finally. Plus size fashion.

11:34.882 --> 11:37.041
But I wrote it when I was
coming off of Y

11:37.051 --> 11:39.043
and I'm afraid it's a little ethereal.

11:39.053 --> 11:41.545
Y's tough. Yeah.

11:41.555 --> 11:43.614
You sure it was even in English?

11:43.624 --> 11:45.516
Barely.

11:45.526 --> 11:47.952
But I turned it in anyway.

11:47.962 --> 11:50.721
Well, New Baptists
face their fears, kid.

11:50.731 --> 11:53.357
<i>Kitty Montgomery's office.</i>

11:53.367 --> 11:56.060
- Hey, this is Plum.
- <i>Come in and see Kitty at four.</i>

11:56.070 --> 11:58.370
I don't know if I'm available...

11:59.940 --> 12:02.400
- You've been summoned.
- Yeah.

12:02.410 --> 12:04.268
Kitty wants me in at four.

12:04.278 --> 12:06.745
No. Verena. They want you
back at the house.

12:17.158 --> 12:20.451
- Feel different?
- Just balder.

12:20.461 --> 12:24.655
Oh, my. Marlowe does like to
throw our girls in the deep end.

12:24.665 --> 12:27.425
Didn't you know what she was gonna
make me do? Isn't that your plan?

12:27.435 --> 12:30.895
Um, I am the curator of the plan.

12:30.905 --> 12:32.630
What does that even mean?

12:32.640 --> 12:35.441
It's a larger discussion.
Did you bring your dress?

12:37.878 --> 12:40.905
This is stupid.

12:40.915 --> 12:42.807
I mean, I get it...

12:42.817 --> 12:44.075
and it's stupid.

12:44.085 --> 12:47.144
Get what, exactly?

12:47.154 --> 12:49.780
I really need to say it?

12:49.790 --> 12:51.949
You're all trying
to get me to understand

12:51.959 --> 12:54.218
that becoming thin is becoming bangable,

12:54.228 --> 12:58.422
and becoming bangable
is like a prison of its own.

12:58.432 --> 13:00.658
Can I graduate now?

13:00.668 --> 13:03.294
Um, that's simplifying,

13:03.304 --> 13:06.230
but yeah, you're in
the ballpark, smarty-pants.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.965
Whatever.

13:07.975 --> 13:11.335
As long as the check clears.

13:11.345 --> 13:13.437
I'm getting my surgery.

13:13.447 --> 13:16.073
Well, that's up to you.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.109
I'm not gonna try and
convince you otherwise.

13:18.119 --> 13:21.245
Besides, I'm too tired.
One hour of sleep last night.

13:21.255 --> 13:23.647
What, are you coming off Y, too?

13:23.657 --> 13:26.684
Nope. Bomb threat.

13:26.694 --> 13:28.185
Nobody slept.

13:28.195 --> 13:30.354
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

13:30.364 --> 13:32.590
- Why?
- Why not?

13:32.600 --> 13:35.126
It's a radical space for radical women.

13:35.136 --> 13:37.128
People feel threatened by that.

13:37.138 --> 13:39.363
What's so radical about it?

13:39.373 --> 13:42.867
Well, real change
can't come from inside.

13:42.877 --> 13:44.668
You gotta create a whole new system.

13:44.678 --> 13:46.812
And that's Calliope House.

13:49.984 --> 13:53.344
Did Verena tell you there was a
bomb threat at Calliope last night?

13:53.354 --> 13:55.479
Yeah, again. Taxi!

13:55.489 --> 13:57.982
Doesn't that seem weird?
I mean, they seem harmless,

13:57.993 --> 13:59.655
but with everything going
on, I can't help but wonder

13:59.666 --> 14:02.019
- if Jennifer and Calliope...
- Are connected?

14:02.029 --> 14:03.787
Verena'd get a kick out of that.

14:03.797 --> 14:05.656
Well, don't <i> tell</i> her.

14:05.666 --> 14:08.893
Well, it's not entirely crazy,
but Verena and Calliope,

14:08.903 --> 14:10.895
there's no way they'd condone
any kind of bloodshed.

14:10.905 --> 14:12.296
And you'd know, right?

14:12.306 --> 14:14.832
Don't conflate feminism with violence.

14:14.842 --> 14:16.867
It sound very uninformed.

14:16.877 --> 14:19.537
Speaking of violence,
how much more torture today?

14:19.547 --> 14:21.405
I have to see Kitty in four hours.

14:21.415 --> 14:24.208
No worries.
Only two more appointments...

14:24.218 --> 14:25.551
today.

14:39.491 --> 14:42.751
- Hmm.
- Is something wrong?

14:42.761 --> 14:46.088
I wouldn't say there's
anything wrong, per se,

14:46.098 --> 14:49.224
but freezing and plumping help.

14:49.234 --> 14:52.227
- Help what?
- All women.

14:52.237 --> 14:56.465
Even the young ones, because
bangability is a goal for <i> everyone.</i>

14:56.475 --> 15:00.502
OK. You're numb, so this won't hurt.

15:00.512 --> 15:02.078
Much.

15:06.118 --> 15:10.946
Hmm. You've lost some tissue
in the nasal labial folds.

15:10.956 --> 15:13.649
This will really balance out
your features.

15:13.659 --> 15:15.459
I think you're gonna love it.

15:17.496 --> 15:19.855
If I live to find out.

15:19.865 --> 15:22.332
Pretty hurts, but ugly hurts more.

15:26.672 --> 15:29.865
<i>So the pretty former sitcom star</i>

15:29.875 --> 15:33.043
<i>led me off to yet another
torture session.</i>

15:36.615 --> 15:42.110
- Paul.
- Look what the gods dragged in!

15:42.120 --> 15:44.279
- Mwah. Mwah.
- Paul, this is Plum.

15:44.289 --> 15:46.982
Mwah. Mwah.

15:46.992 --> 15:51.119
We want to make her, um...

15:51.129 --> 15:52.654
uh, what's the word?

15:52.664 --> 15:54.965
- Bangable.
- That's it.

15:58.237 --> 16:00.529
The hair is gorgeous.

16:00.539 --> 16:03.499
<i>You</i> have beautiful features.

16:03.509 --> 16:06.877
The eyes... and these lips...

16:10.082 --> 16:12.708
Let's do some contouring.

16:12.718 --> 16:15.485
You need to make your face
looks slimmer.

16:31.770 --> 16:34.363
- Good.
- <i>Great.</i>

16:34.373 --> 16:36.532
You are going to turn heads, Plum.

16:36.542 --> 16:40.769
Just what I need... Even more attention.

16:40.779 --> 16:42.871
Primer, moisturizer,

16:42.881 --> 16:46.108
four shadows, concealer,

16:46.118 --> 16:49.211
foundation, bronzer,

16:49.221 --> 16:52.047
brow pencil, lip pencil,

16:52.057 --> 16:55.584
lipstick, lip tint,
lip gloss... what else?

16:55.594 --> 16:57.219
Powder.

16:57.229 --> 16:58.628
Brow gel.

16:59.698 --> 17:01.957
Brushes, all right?

17:04.435 --> 17:06.694
$1,016.58.

17:06.704 --> 17:07.963
<i>Thank</i> you.

17:07.973 --> 17:09.739
Worth ever penny, right?

17:11.710 --> 17:13.935
Run along, hot stuff.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.070
Don't you gotta go see your boss?

17:16.080 --> 17:17.814
Yeah.

17:25.891 --> 17:27.648
What happened to you?

17:27.659 --> 17:29.084
I don't really...

17:29.094 --> 17:31.486
Is this why I haven't
been able to find you?

17:31.496 --> 17:34.556
You've been too busy tottering
around town trying to get glam?

17:34.566 --> 17:36.792
I'm sorry, uh,

17:36.802 --> 17:39.394
I... had a death in the family.

17:39.404 --> 17:41.763
Oh.

17:41.773 --> 17:43.999
Well, that's terrible.

17:44.009 --> 17:46.635
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:46.645 --> 17:48.337
Thank you.

17:48.347 --> 17:50.238
So, your article.

17:50.248 --> 17:53.475
<i>Way</i> too wordy. Riddled with typos.

17:53.485 --> 17:55.577
But it's different.

17:55.587 --> 17:57.679
In a good way.

17:57.689 --> 17:59.681
I actually think there's a <i> there</i> there.

17:59.691 --> 18:02.117
Thank you. So much.

18:02.127 --> 18:05.253
You're full of surprises, huh?

18:05.263 --> 18:07.089
Eladio will type up my notes,

18:07.099 --> 18:09.658
and if you can follow them,
it'll be in next month's issue.

18:09.668 --> 18:13.161
Really? I can't believe it.

18:13.171 --> 18:17.132
I'm coming around to the
specialized angle for my readers.

18:17.142 --> 18:20.035
I know that some of my girls
have weight problems.

18:20.045 --> 18:24.539
At first, I didn't want
to encourage them to be fat.

18:24.549 --> 18:26.541
I mean, if you give them pretty clothes,

18:26.551 --> 18:28.443
where's the incentive to be healthy?

18:28.453 --> 18:32.022
But in the end, I feel it's
nice to include everyone.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.217
Got it.

18:35.227 --> 18:37.052
Uh, well, I will clean it up...

18:37.062 --> 18:39.321
How are my girls? What's on their minds?

18:39.331 --> 18:41.857
I bet they're talking about
that serum we featured.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.359
Uh, not yet.

18:44.369 --> 18:46.828
Um, ghosting is a big thing.

18:46.838 --> 18:48.797
There's less cutters...

18:48.807 --> 18:50.699
Bulimia too, actually.

18:50.709 --> 18:53.068
Um, some anxiety about Jennifer...

18:53.078 --> 18:55.504
Well, that's to be expected. Terrible.

18:55.514 --> 18:57.372
Actually, most of them are in favor.

18:57.382 --> 19:01.476
A fair number of the girls
seem... exhilarated.

19:01.486 --> 19:03.812
Empowered, or something like that.

19:03.822 --> 19:06.381
I guess they feel like
they matter, somehow.

19:06.391 --> 19:09.351
Like even if they don't
fit in with their peers,

19:09.361 --> 19:11.828
they still matter anyway, you know?

19:13.265 --> 19:14.756
Interesting.

19:14.766 --> 19:16.725
I thought so too.

19:16.735 --> 19:18.026
Eladio?

19:18.036 --> 19:20.395
I need a cucumber spritz
and some privacy.

19:20.405 --> 19:22.197
<i> You got it.</i>

19:22.207 --> 19:24.366
No, no...

19:24.376 --> 19:26.935
<i>Can you get extra
copies</i> for your cousins?

19:26.945 --> 19:29.071
Ooh, Tammy and Sue will freak out!

19:29.081 --> 19:31.740
Mom.<i> If</i> Kitty thinks
I took her notes well,

19:31.750 --> 19:33.608
it won't even be a full page.

19:33.618 --> 19:36.511
It'll be in a box next to
pictures of Kim Kardashian's ass.

19:36.521 --> 19:38.413
You'll take her notes well.

19:38.423 --> 19:41.216
You can have your own article.
<i>Your</i> words.

19:41.226 --> 19:44.419
The whole world will see
my radiant, brilliant girl.

19:44.429 --> 19:46.388
Even without the makeup and heels.

19:46.398 --> 19:49.357
Radiant, huh? That's what
Charlotte called Wilbur.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.393
Charlotte the spider from the book?

19:51.403 --> 19:53.862
You know that's not what I meant.

19:53.872 --> 19:56.732
All I'm saying is that I wish you
could focus on your accomplishments

19:56.742 --> 19:58.700
instead of trying to be
something you're not.

19:58.710 --> 20:00.744
- Mom.
- I'm not saying anything.

20:02.414 --> 20:04.706
Leave some for the cake, why don't you?

20:04.716 --> 20:06.541
I'm trying to stop. I need help.

20:06.551 --> 20:09.244
Stop! Go brush your teeth
so you don't want any more.

20:09.254 --> 20:10.946
Oh! That's such a good trick.

20:10.956 --> 20:12.555
I could write a book.

20:13.725 --> 20:16.251
I just want you to be happy.

20:16.261 --> 20:17.827
You know that.

21:33.371 --> 21:35.297
I'm making tea.

21:35.307 --> 21:36.973
I already brushed.

21:41.012 --> 21:42.404
It's OK.

21:42.414 --> 21:44.039
It's all right.

21:44.049 --> 21:46.508
It's not OK! What did they do to you?

21:46.518 --> 21:48.076
It's just bruising.

21:48.086 --> 21:49.845
It's Botox and Restylane.

21:49.855 --> 21:51.012
This is what it looks like.

21:51.022 --> 21:53.248
No.

21:53.258 --> 21:56.017
No, I thought maybe these people
were helping, but...

21:56.027 --> 21:57.552
this is creepy!

21:57.562 --> 21:59.054
Worse, it's cruel.

21:59.064 --> 22:01.056
It's just bruising. It's not cruel.

22:01.066 --> 22:02.724
Do you know how many women do this?

22:02.734 --> 22:04.893
I don't care. You're a young woman.

22:04.903 --> 22:07.596
Why would they... Verena...
Want to do this to you?

22:07.606 --> 22:10.532
- She's making a point.
- What, by mutilating you?

22:10.542 --> 22:12.000
You're beautiful.

22:12.010 --> 22:14.202
I'm <i> not</i> beautiful. I'm fat.

22:14.212 --> 22:16.538
Slim does not mean beautiful.

22:16.548 --> 22:18.707
You sure as shit can't
be beautiful without it.

22:18.717 --> 22:20.108
No. No. Uh-uh.

22:20.118 --> 22:22.110
I have to do this. It's fine.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.879
I want to meet these people.

22:23.889 --> 22:25.881
I'm not a child. You have to trust me.

22:25.891 --> 22:28.350
I want to, but this scares me, honey.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.719
- I thought you understood.
- Where are you going?

22:30.729 --> 22:32.446
I need a walk.

22:42.574 --> 22:45.567
- Plum. Plum!
- Jesus! What are you doing?!

22:45.577 --> 22:48.436
- I'm sorry. I needed to...
- What do you got against phones?

22:48.446 --> 22:50.405
Ooh. A lot. Especially now.

22:50.415 --> 22:51.706
But I... Whoa. Whoa!

22:51.716 --> 22:54.376
Jesus, wt happened to your face?

22:54.386 --> 22:56.077
Nothing. It'll go away by Friday.

22:56.087 --> 22:58.113
Did that cop do this to you?

22:58.123 --> 23:00.148
N... Dominic?

23:00.158 --> 23:02.884
You think Dominic roughed me up?

23:02.894 --> 23:06.988
Well, I don't know.
He's... a man, isn't he?

23:06.998 --> 23:10.892
Nah, it's Verena's plan.
She sent me to a dermatologist.

23:12.570 --> 23:15.463
That was not part of her book.

23:15.473 --> 23:17.599
What, do you got a new one for me now?

23:17.609 --> 23:20.435
"The Tyranny of Motherhood," maybe?

23:20.445 --> 23:22.070
Being one or having one?

23:22.080 --> 23:23.346
It's a joke.

23:24.482 --> 23:26.241
Right..

23:26.251 --> 23:28.510
You are funny.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.687
Like, consistently. I...

23:31.990 --> 23:36.025
Um, I wanted to see you before I...

23:37.595 --> 23:39.362
Um, I'm leaving.

23:40.432 --> 23:43.325
So... good-bye.

23:43.335 --> 23:45.527
Good-bye? Why, what's happening?

23:45.537 --> 23:48.863
You know, I... I have to bounce

23:48.873 --> 23:50.473
for a while.

23:51.509 --> 23:53.168
Maybe forever.

23:53.178 --> 23:55.278
Can you be more specific?

23:57.015 --> 23:58.381
No.

24:08.626 --> 24:11.519
Oh, uh, when Verena
is finished with you,

24:11.529 --> 24:12.954
come find me.

24:12.964 --> 24:15.190
Can you give me a clue?

24:15.200 --> 24:17.125
Please? Where are you going?

24:17.135 --> 24:20.228
You'll, um... You'll figure it out.

24:20.238 --> 24:22.372
This is about Jennifer.

24:24.509 --> 24:26.342
Just be careful.

24:35.587 --> 24:38.580
<i> The body drops, the manifesto...</i>

24:38.591 --> 24:41.868
<i>I didn't feel it yet,
but it was working.</i>

24:55.266 --> 24:57.392
<i> Jennifer has inadvertently established</i>

24:57.402 --> 25:00.362
<i>a new kind of segregation
among the sexes.</i>

25:00.372 --> 25:02.864
<i>Well, maybe inadvertently.</i>

25:02.874 --> 25:05.433
<i>I don't presume to know
what these people want.</i>

25:05.443 --> 25:09.204
<i>At this point, all we have
are questions and theories.</i>

25:09.214 --> 25:11.773
<i>Are they anarchists?
Desperate housewives?</i>

25:11.783 --> 25:14.676
<i>Or could they be men posing as women?</i>

25:14.686 --> 25:16.544
<i>Next...</i>

25:16.554 --> 25:18.079
<i>My own street, I don't feel safe.</i>

25:18.089 --> 25:20.882
<i>It's outrageous. I'm getting scared.</i>

25:20.892 --> 25:22.684
<i>Oh, my God, I went running at midnight.</i>

25:22.694 --> 25:25.053
<i>Never done that before
in my life. It's great.</i>

25:25.063 --> 25:26.888
You should be <i> spinning.</i>

25:26.898 --> 25:29.098
Running's too hard on the face.

25:30.268 --> 25:31.760
Eladio?

25:31.770 --> 25:33.461
Get what's-her-name to post an article

25:33.471 --> 25:36.472
about the aging effects
running has on women over 35.

25:37.709 --> 25:39.776
And where am I having lunch?

25:47.487 --> 25:50.879
<i>"Naturally, supermodels'
income surpass educators'</i>

25:50.889 --> 25:54.149
<i>and even many female
executives' incomes.</i>

25:54.159 --> 25:57.919
"That's because supermodels hold
the ultimate worth: bangability."

25:57.929 --> 25:59.421
This is not helping.

25:59.431 --> 26:01.089
Well, maybe if you had
done your homework,

26:01.099 --> 26:02.457
I wouldn't have to read it to you.

26:02.467 --> 26:04.392
But you need to know this information.

26:04.402 --> 26:06.094
- Do I?
- Yeah.

26:06.104 --> 26:07.629
It's an opinion, right?

26:07.639 --> 26:11.074
Dressed in an agenda?
Couched in propaganda?

26:12.177 --> 26:13.910
You look great.

26:18.116 --> 26:19.774
Those are hot.

26:19.784 --> 26:21.476
I feel like the bones in my toes

26:21.486 --> 26:23.623
are actually fusing together right now.

26:23.634 --> 26:26.014
You know, some women actually
have their pinkie toes removed

26:26.024 --> 26:27.348
to make them fit better.

26:27.358 --> 26:28.817
OK, well, that's crazy.

26:28.827 --> 26:31.686
Crazier than getting
your stomach stapled?

26:31.696 --> 26:33.096
We'll take 'em.

26:37.001 --> 26:40.261
<i>"We're told that
desirability can be earned</i>

26:40.271 --> 26:41.696
through hard work,

26:41.706 --> 26:43.698
"self-control, and dieting."

26:43.708 --> 26:45.675
Could you just lower your voice?

26:45.686 --> 26:48.103
"Women who shrink their
bodies to the size of adolescents'"

26:48.113 --> 26:50.371
and ornament them withnormous
breasts and crippling shoes

26:50.381 --> 26:52.173
"will be rewarded with every success."

26:52.183 --> 26:54.442
You know, I'm not
doing this to get laid.

26:54.452 --> 26:55.977
Then why do you want to be thin?

26:55.987 --> 26:58.480
Wanting to be attractive
isn't oppression, OK?

26:58.490 --> 26:59.981
It's primal.

26:59.991 --> 27:01.683
Women and men have been
adorning themselves

27:01.693 --> 27:03.451
since the dawn of time.

27:03.461 --> 27:06.321
We are not talking about landing
a mate on the savanna, Plum.

27:06.331 --> 27:08.990
What you want is society at <i> large...</i>

27:09.000 --> 27:11.960
Excuse the pun... To deem you bangable.

27:11.970 --> 27:15.029
You want to have good looks to be
considered a valuable commodity.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.557
That's what you want...

27:16.932 --> 27:18.633
OK,<i> enough.</i> She's twelve years old.

27:18.643 --> 27:22.070
- I'm sorry. E-Excuse us.
- Oh, OK.

27:22.080 --> 27:25.140
But it's all right
for your baby to wear makeup

27:25.150 --> 27:28.476
and shorts tight enough where
I can see her moose knuckle?

27:28.486 --> 27:31.412
- Hey...
- Enough! Stop it!

27:31.422 --> 27:34.048
Do not go gently into
that good night, darling.

27:34.058 --> 27:35.892
You have choices.

27:44.277 --> 27:45.456
Yes?

27:45.480 --> 27:47.729
What the hell are you
doing to my daughter?

27:49.636 --> 27:51.538
<i>What is this place?</i>

27:51.549 --> 27:53.374
What do you want with my daughter?

27:53.384 --> 27:54.450
Milk or sugar?

27:57.902 --> 28:01.329
Calliope House is a healing space

28:01.339 --> 28:02.897
for damaged and abused women...

28:02.907 --> 28:04.519
See, that's the trouble I have with you.

28:04.530 --> 28:07.200
Plum isn't damaged
and she was never abused.

28:07.211 --> 28:09.103
- How do you know?
- I'd know.

28:09.113 --> 28:12.106
My child talks to me. We have
that kind of relationship.

28:12.116 --> 28:15.843
I'm sorry if you didn't with your mom.

28:15.853 --> 28:19.847
I didn't, but that has nothing to
do with my relationship with Plum.

28:19.857 --> 28:21.215
I'm trying to help her.

28:21.225 --> 28:23.084
Look, I know that's your intention,

28:23.094 --> 28:24.686
but I don't think you really get it,

28:24.696 --> 28:26.587
what the Baptist Plan <i>did</i> to people.

28:26.597 --> 28:29.390
- I really think I do.
- No. There's no way

28:29.400 --> 28:31.225
you can understand how it felt

28:31.235 --> 28:33.194
to watch my baby spend all her money

28:33.204 --> 28:34.929
on your mother's shitty food.

28:34.939 --> 28:38.099
I didn't stop it back then,
but I'm smarter now.

28:38.109 --> 28:41.110
My mother made me eat that food.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.806
Her greatest fear was that I'd be fat.

28:44.816 --> 28:47.041
And my father thought
it would be a good life lesson

28:47.051 --> 28:49.277
if I earned the money
to pay for it myself.

28:49.287 --> 28:50.978
You didn't put that in the book.

28:50.988 --> 28:52.613
Uhm-uhm.

28:52.623 --> 28:54.749
I didn't want the story to be about me.

28:54.759 --> 28:59.228
Or maybe you didn't want people
to know you're crazy too.

29:01.899 --> 29:06.094
If Plum wants to quit now,
she can cash the check.

29:06.104 --> 29:08.596
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

29:08.606 --> 29:10.798
All I am trying to do is help her see

29:10.808 --> 29:12.500
that happiness has nothing to do

29:12.510 --> 29:15.077
with how you look
and how much you weigh.

29:17.682 --> 29:20.007
Tell me something.
You're a beautiful woman...

29:20.017 --> 29:21.943
Did everything go your way?

29:21.953 --> 29:24.078
Oh, yeah.

29:24.088 --> 29:25.680
Yeah, it's been a picnic.

29:30.461 --> 29:32.286
<i>We're here today</i>

29:32.296 --> 29:36.524
<i>to talk about the name
on everyone's lips: Jennifer.</i>

29:36.534 --> 29:38.968
<i>Our next guest is...</i>

30:04.395 --> 30:06.354
Put this on every women's cover.

30:06.364 --> 30:08.823
<i>Daisy Chain, Belle Appeal, Swag Rag...</i>

30:08.833 --> 30:10.691
The whole Kitty-caboodle.

30:12.336 --> 30:13.828
- But they're all been printed.
- So?

30:13.838 --> 30:16.464
"An all-female judicial division,"

30:16.474 --> 30:19.834
presidential elections must
only offer female candidates

30:19.844 --> 30:21.669
for the next 50 years." What is this?

30:21.679 --> 30:23.638
I just told you. It's the cover.

30:23.648 --> 30:26.898
Make it pop. Maybe have a
woman's hand holding it, or...

30:26.909 --> 30:29.710
"Equal pay <i> plus</i> one-third
for all women."

30:29.720 --> 30:32.180
Come on, Kitty, I get putting
this on <i> Daisy Chain,</i> but...

30:32.190 --> 30:35.491
I want the manifesto printed on
every magazine in the catalogue.

30:35.502 --> 30:38.994
Oh, and get Digital to feature
it on all the websites.

30:40.498 --> 30:42.890
Did Stanley sanction this?

30:42.900 --> 30:46.569
Stanley sanctioned <i> me,</i> Pablo.

30:49.997 --> 30:51.866
Sorry, I know this
is a little uncomfortable.

30:51.876 --> 30:53.275
I'm OK.

31:04.422 --> 31:06.747
- This is amazing.
- Isn't it?

31:06.757 --> 31:09.350
The secondary surgeries
after you've lost the weight

31:09.360 --> 31:11.018
can be more challenging.

31:11.028 --> 31:14.555
Most people your size
can drop to a size 12 or a 14,

31:14.565 --> 31:18.359
which leaves a lot of loose skin
where there used to be fat.

31:18.369 --> 31:20.629
We remove the excess flesh
in subsequent surgeries...

31:20.640 --> 31:24.467
<i>I was about to become
Alicia, and I'd be perfect.</i>

31:24.775 --> 31:26.734
The abdominoplasty and mastopexy

31:26.744 --> 31:28.903
will leave significant,
permanent scarring,

31:28.913 --> 31:30.938
and based on your family history,

31:30.948 --> 31:33.574
you're at risk for
cheloidal scars as well.

31:33.584 --> 31:35.584
But at least you'll be thin.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.557
Oh, my God.

31:47.754 --> 31:49.433
Have fun?

31:50.190 --> 31:53.083
Look what I have for your next task.

31:53.093 --> 31:54.751
You ready?

31:54.761 --> 31:56.420
- Ta-da!
- No, no, you said

31:56.430 --> 31:57.633
this was our last appointment.

31:57.644 --> 31:59.328
Oh, for me it is. But Verena's got

31:59.339 --> 32:01.424
the next step of the program
all ready to go.

32:01.435 --> 32:03.126
You just have to go on a few dates.

32:03.136 --> 32:04.194
Should be a breeze.

32:04.204 --> 32:05.696
- Dating.
- Mm-hmm.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.731
No. That's not happening.

32:07.741 --> 32:09.733
What did you think the makeover was for?

32:09.743 --> 32:12.803
You see, my part was creating
the pretty package,

32:12.813 --> 32:14.738
and the next part
of the New Baptist Plan

32:14.748 --> 32:16.740
is <i> presenting</i> the pretty package.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.910
You want to piss me off?
Fine. I'm pissed.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.812
I get it. I'll never be Angelina Jolie.
I won't even be Alicia.

32:23.823 --> 32:26.216
- You are Alicia. You're Alicia right now.
- No. I'm not.

32:26.226 --> 32:27.384
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.

32:27.394 --> 32:29.094
- You are.
- I'm <i> not.</i>

32:29.105 --> 32:31.154
And fine, I'll never be perfect,

32:31.164 --> 32:33.423
but I am not OK in this body,

32:33.433 --> 32:35.492
and I don't give a shit
what you think about it.

32:35.502 --> 32:37.394
The next step is dating.

32:37.404 --> 32:39.429
You are wearing the dress.

32:39.439 --> 32:40.731
Screw the money.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.165
How are you gonna pay for it?

32:42.175 --> 32:44.167
I don't care. I'll figure it out.

32:44.177 --> 32:45.936
Plum, don't. You are almost there.

32:45.946 --> 32:47.646
I'm <i> not</i> doing this!

32:52.486 --> 32:54.144
- Mom?
- Honey.

32:54.154 --> 32:56.780
This is your mom? Hi. Marlowe.

32:56.790 --> 32:58.849
- From the show?
- What are you doing here?

32:58.859 --> 33:01.018
- Oh, just talking.
- Making sure we're not a cult.

33:01.028 --> 33:03.186
Did she buy it?
'Cause I'm not convinced.

33:03.196 --> 33:05.789
Tell me what you want to know.

33:05.799 --> 33:09.293
- Stop trying to manipulate me!
- Plum!

33:09.303 --> 33:12.462
I know you <i> have</i> been manipulated
all your life.

33:12.472 --> 33:15.265
But I am here to help you heal
from having been told

33:15.275 --> 33:17.200
- since you were five years old how you should...
- I don't want to heal.

33:17.210 --> 33:18.602
- Dress, think.
- I just want to lose weight.

33:18.612 --> 33:20.537
Baby, think about what you just said.

33:20.547 --> 33:22.439
We're trying to help you stop
trying to conform to thextent

33:22.449 --> 33:24.341
that you undermine your
potential to make a difference.

33:24.351 --> 33:25.886
You conformed.

33:25.897 --> 33:28.178
Look at you. You're so
pretty you have acolytes...

33:28.188 --> 33:30.948
Fitting in can make some
things easier, yes,

33:30.958 --> 33:32.816
but standing out the way you do

33:32.826 --> 33:34.217
shouldn't equal punishment.

33:34.227 --> 33:37.821
Forget other people.
You punish yourself.

33:37.831 --> 33:41.224
- So what?
- So, you are angry at yourself.

33:41.234 --> 33:44.302
- So what?!
- It has to stop.

33:46.306 --> 33:49.674
I think you know that, Plum.

33:58.585 --> 34:00.978
I just got the strangest
call from Pablo.

34:00.988 --> 34:03.480
Is there a problem?

34:03.490 --> 34:07.484
You understand that I can't
allow you to do this.

34:07.494 --> 34:10.687
It's a content decision outside
of your jurisdiction, Jeff.

34:10.697 --> 34:13.489
CFO's have jurisdiction
over anything involving money.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.192
My expertise...

34:15.202 --> 34:17.561
The board hired me to calculate risk.

34:17.571 --> 34:19.596
Stanley and the board
agreed to print the manifesto

34:19.606 --> 34:21.931
in order to protect the men
at Austen Media.

34:21.942 --> 34:23.667
Technically, you're a
member of that group.

34:23.677 --> 34:25.569
Per my advice,

34:25.579 --> 34:29.272
they voted to publish it
only on the <i> Daisy Chain</i> cover.

34:29.282 --> 34:31.108
Your advice?

34:31.118 --> 34:34.110
Well, I was consulted privately, yes.

34:34.121 --> 34:36.913
All due respect to your title.

34:36.922 --> 34:40.583
I mean, you may enjoy
splashing that hysterical screed

34:40.594 --> 34:42.351
all over Austen Media,

34:42.362 --> 34:45.054
but I won't sign off on a
half-million dollar expenditure

34:45.065 --> 34:48.257
so you can feel relevant.

34:48.268 --> 34:49.534
It's nothin' personal, honey.

34:51.571 --> 34:54.297
It isn't personal, is it? No.

34:54.306 --> 34:57.067
I see that now.
You're only doing your job.

34:57.077 --> 35:00.103
And protecting me from my sh decision.

35:00.113 --> 35:02.239
You've always been chivalrous that way.

35:02.249 --> 35:04.641
Like when you insisted
on wearing a condom

35:04.651 --> 35:07.944
when you screwed my second...
Or was it my third? assistant.

35:07.954 --> 35:11.715
- I didn't... You...
- Doubly thoughtful since she was only 20

35:11.725 --> 35:15.085
and completely incapable of taking
care of an illegitimate child,

35:15.095 --> 35:17.387
or for you pressuring her
to have an abortion.

35:17.397 --> 35:20.257
You know, I think you
should tell your wife.

35:20.267 --> 35:22.759
I bet she would thank you
for protecting her

35:22.769 --> 35:24.494
from getting an ugly divorce.

35:24.504 --> 35:26.897
Maybe even give you
a half-decent roll in the hay.

35:26.907 --> 35:29.900
I'm not like those men. She...

35:29.910 --> 35:32.269
Jenni, it was very consensual.

35:32.279 --> 35:36.273
I'm not a predator.
And my marriage is very...

35:36.283 --> 35:38.842
Complicated. I know...

35:38.852 --> 35:39.976
honey.

35:39.986 --> 35:41.453
Aren't they all?

35:43.356 --> 35:45.415
Approve the expenditure.

35:45.425 --> 35:47.984
And tell Pablo <i> never</i>
to question my authority again

35:47.994 --> 35:49.828
or he'll be begging for a job at Avon.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.926
<i>This is last-meal good.</i>

35:55.936 --> 35:57.994
- Are you faking it?
- Mmm.

35:58.004 --> 36:01.364
I'm on death row, they go and
ask me "What do you want?"

36:01.374 --> 36:04.501
I am sayin', "Bring me this cake."

36:04.511 --> 36:06.803
You know, I considered
baking you a four-layer,

36:06.813 --> 36:08.472
but I hardly know you.

36:08.482 --> 36:10.340
- Ah.
- Come on. One bite.

36:10.350 --> 36:11.608
No. Come on.

36:11.618 --> 36:13.677
I can't do cake. Look at me.

36:13.687 --> 36:15.553
I am lookin' at you.

36:19.392 --> 36:22.452
I wanted to tell you, the other
night when I called you...

36:22.462 --> 36:24.287
I'd stopped taking these meds.

36:24.297 --> 36:25.789
- I'm <i> really</i> embarrassed.
- Don't.

36:25.799 --> 36:26.990
We're friends.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.658
But you went above and beyond.

36:28.668 --> 36:30.894
You brought me water, you...
You didn't have to do that.

36:30.904 --> 36:32.804
You were going through something.

36:34.074 --> 36:36.066
You know, um...

36:36.076 --> 36:38.168
you made me touch your skin.

36:38.178 --> 36:41.037
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

36:41.047 --> 36:44.407
Don't be. You were right.

36:44.417 --> 36:46.651
It's soft.

36:49.589 --> 36:51.648
I wanted to run something by you.

36:51.658 --> 36:54.251
Do you think that it's possible

36:54.261 --> 36:58.221
that Jennifer is an offshoot
of Calliope House?

36:58.231 --> 36:59.931
I feel like th...

37:01.001 --> 37:02.726
What?

37:02.736 --> 37:07.063
I don't know, I feel like
they're trying to trigger me.

37:07.073 --> 37:08.665
Like, radicalize me.

37:08.675 --> 37:10.257
It's possible.

37:10.268 --> 37:11.918
They get bomb threats.
Did you know that?

37:11.929 --> 37:13.870
Yeah. Yeah, I am aware of that.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.705
And they're cruel.

37:15.715 --> 37:18.074
Like, they put me through pain.

37:18.084 --> 37:20.277
They... They have plenty of money,

37:20.287 --> 37:23.180
the women are all crazy-devoted
to Verena. It's like a cult.

37:23.190 --> 37:25.582
There's something going on there.

37:25.592 --> 37:28.259
It's too much for me. I'm walkin' away.

37:31.698 --> 37:33.464
What if I asked you not to?

37:35.202 --> 37:36.893
I just said I think they're a cult

37:36.903 --> 37:38.762
and they're probably
connected to Jennifer.

37:38.772 --> 37:41.306
And I'm sayin'
I think you're probably right.

37:42.809 --> 37:44.534
Jennifer <i> kills</i> people.

37:44.544 --> 37:46.976
You want me to hang out with them?

37:46.987 --> 37:49.405
You're already hangin' out with them.
That's why it'll work.

37:49.416 --> 37:51.608
Why what'll work?
What, are we gonna bust 'em?

37:51.618 --> 37:53.337
Maybe. Finding a link?

37:53.348 --> 37:56.580
Look, if I thought you were
really at risk, I wouldn't ask.

37:56.590 --> 37:58.715
Jennifer's not interested
in hurting women, right?

37:58.725 --> 38:01.251
Oh, well, that's comforting. Not at <i> all.</i>

38:01.261 --> 38:02.719
They're feminists, right?

38:02.729 --> 38:06.256
They limit their fire to bad <i> guys.</i>

38:06.266 --> 38:09.492
Look, you help me crack this,

38:09.502 --> 38:12.229
think of the story you're gonna write.

38:12.239 --> 38:14.564
You. Not Kitty, you.

38:14.574 --> 38:16.299
Think of the people that you'll help.

38:16.309 --> 38:18.001
And I'm gonna be watching you.

38:18.011 --> 38:20.678
There's no way I'm gonna let
anything happen to you.

38:23.650 --> 38:25.516
I promise.

38:29.789 --> 38:32.423
Haven't you ever wanted to be a hero?

38:37.360 --> 38:39.218
- Thank you, Frank.
- Sorry, Ms. Montgomery.

38:39.228 --> 38:41.287
It's not a good time.
He's behind closed doors.

38:41.297 --> 38:44.031
I know you're not grabbing
my Saint Laurent.

39:02.351 --> 39:03.876
Shit, Stanley!

39:03.886 --> 39:05.745
You all right?

39:05.755 --> 39:07.313
Goddamnit!

39:07.323 --> 39:10.183
Ohh. You struck my drone.

39:10.193 --> 39:12.084
I don't see any blood.

39:12.094 --> 39:14.220
Good. If you had hit my face...

39:14.230 --> 39:16.189
God forbid. Not the moneymaker,

39:16.199 --> 39:17.924
not the moneymaker...

39:17.934 --> 39:21.494
So, you're all wound up.
Do I need to fire somebody?

39:21.504 --> 39:24.764
You might.
But that's not what it's about.

39:24.774 --> 39:26.065
This Jennifer thing.

39:26.075 --> 39:27.834
Jennifer who?

39:27.844 --> 39:29.569
The organization.

39:29.579 --> 39:31.704
Hmm. Terrorists, you mean.

39:31.714 --> 39:34.707
One man's terrorist is another
woman's liberator, Stanley.

39:34.717 --> 39:36.776
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

39:36.786 --> 39:40.947
It means this is a ground-floor,
billion-dollar opportunity.

39:40.957 --> 39:43.516
This is Apple stock in 1980.

39:43.526 --> 39:47.186
What are you talking... There's
nothing to invest in, Kitty.

39:47.196 --> 39:49.088
Have you been watching the news?

39:49.098 --> 39:52.291
Jennifer is getting
to every woman on the planet.

39:52.301 --> 39:54.927
They're tapping into something
that you can't understand.

39:54.937 --> 39:57.196
You need to let me
take the tiller on this.

39:57.206 --> 39:58.798
On what? J...

39:58.808 --> 40:00.900
Just tell me what you want to do.

40:00.910 --> 40:02.869
It's already done.

40:02.879 --> 40:04.737
We're publishing the manifesto

40:04.747 --> 40:06.906
on the cover of every girls'
and women's magazine

40:06.916 --> 40:08.441
in your catalogue.

40:08.451 --> 40:10.710
Trust me. They're gonna
fly off the shelves.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.079
I wondered what all those
phone calls were about today.

40:13.089 --> 40:17.049
This thing is going to be
bigger than climate change.

40:17.059 --> 40:18.818
We could make our bones, Stanley.

40:18.828 --> 40:21.428
I made my bones, Kitty.

40:22.999 --> 40:25.633
Fine. Whatever you want.

40:27.303 --> 40:28.761
We're not gonna fight this out?

40:28.771 --> 40:30.463
I don't feel like fighting, Kitty.

40:30.473 --> 40:32.439
I just had a hot stone massage.

40:41.083 --> 40:43.584
You used to be a lion.

40:46.422 --> 40:48.022
Maybe.

40:50.192 --> 40:52.359
Is that why you stopped screwing me?

40:53.596 --> 40:54.954
I stopped screwing you

40:54.964 --> 40:57.857
long before you stopped fighting me.

40:57.867 --> 41:01.093
- Who remembers?
- I do.

41:01.103 --> 41:03.470
Good night, Stanley.

41:14.450 --> 41:17.176
At least now you know you don't have
to worry about me anymore, huh?

41:17.186 --> 41:19.353
I think you're in good hands
with Verena. I do.

41:21.724 --> 41:24.350
I hope they're getting through to you.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.119
There's some egg salad in the fridge.

41:27.129 --> 41:28.629
Thank you, Mama.

41:32.335 --> 41:34.301
I love you, honey.

41:35.471 --> 41:37.705
I love you too.

41:41.544 --> 41:43.669
Are they getting through to you?

41:43.679 --> 41:46.038
I think so...

41:46.048 --> 41:47.414
yeah.

41:54.090 --> 41:57.391
OK.

41:59.395 --> 42:01.988
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:01.998 --> 42:03.330
Be safe.

42:10.539 --> 42:12.098
<i>Back then,</i>

42:12.108 --> 42:14.433
<i>nothing was getting through to me.</i>

42:14.443 --> 42:16.335
<i> Hello, Dr. Burton's office.</i>

42:16.345 --> 42:18.504
Hi, this is Alicia Kettle.

42:18.514 --> 42:21.007
I'm calling to put
a deposit down on my surgery.

42:21.017 --> 42:23.376
<i>Because I didn't want to be the hero.</i>

42:23.386 --> 42:26.086
<i>I still wanted to be
the hero's girlfriend.</i>

42:29.091 --> 42:32.918
<i>While I was hell-bent on finishing
my personal revolution,</i>

42:32.928 --> 42:35.521
<i>Kitty was helping
light the fuse of Jennifer's.</i>

42:35.531 --> 42:37.184
<i>She may have been wrong about me,</i>

42:37.195 --> 42:39.629
<i>but she was right about them.</i>
