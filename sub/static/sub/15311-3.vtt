00:00.464 --> 00:02.586
<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:02.625 --> 00:04.073
Let's do it.

00:06.166 --> 00:07.720
Why are you doing this?

00:07.753 --> 00:10.686
You're going to kill the President
of the United States, Ellen.

00:10.688 --> 00:13.691
Otherwise,
we will kill your family.

00:13.791 --> 00:15.292
What's going to happen to us?

00:15.427 --> 00:18.961
Beginning tomorrow, you are going
to return to your normal lives.

00:18.963 --> 00:22.164
For the next two weeks you will
carry on as if nothing is wrong.

00:22.166 --> 00:23.999
We'll be watching you.
Listening to you.

00:24.001 --> 00:25.117
Every move you make,

00:25.193 --> 00:27.659
even when we're not with you,
we'll be with you.

00:27.904 --> 00:28.879
What's that?

00:28.950 --> 00:30.924
You're going to implant a GPS chip
into everyone.

00:30.959 --> 00:33.007
Think of it as an invisible leash.

00:33.009 --> 00:35.043
No one touches Dr. Sanders.

00:35.045 --> 00:37.611
As long as I have your family,
you're not going anywhere.

00:37.613 --> 00:40.320
The President was mistakenly
given a blood thinner

00:40.390 --> 00:42.716
only hours
before his scheduled surgery.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.385
I'm here to find out
exactly what happened.

00:44.387 --> 00:46.220
We need to end
this investigation tonight.

00:46.222 --> 00:47.455
And how are we
supposed to do that?

00:47.457 --> 00:48.889
We give them somebody to blame.

00:48.891 --> 00:50.079
It's about Angela.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.473
The President's nurse
apparently committed suicide.

00:52.508 --> 00:53.927
You son of a bitch.
You killed her.

00:53.929 --> 00:55.704
- No, you did.
- What?

00:55.776 --> 00:57.879
You failed to convince your friend
to confess.

00:57.915 --> 00:59.396
Angela's death is on you.

00:59.468 --> 01:02.063
This guy Nico...
We sold his weed,

01:02.171 --> 01:05.203
but never paid him
because my father found all the money.

01:05.206 --> 01:07.273
Let's stop pretending, Ryan.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.677
We both know you're not the
loving husband you pretend to be.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.271
When is Mommy coming home?

01:12.312 --> 01:14.708
Mommy needs to rest, honey.
So she can get better.

01:14.743 --> 01:16.749
Everything is gonna back
just the way it was.

01:16.751 --> 01:19.918
My partners have
a very low tolerance for failure.

01:25.892 --> 01:29.594
Mr. President, the internet's buzzing
with rumors about that nurse's suicide.

01:29.596 --> 01:31.662
Conspiracy theories,
links to terrorist groups...

01:31.664 --> 01:34.164
No mention of aliens?

01:34.166 --> 01:38.102
Sir, choosing a civilian doctor was
supposed to be a public relations win.

01:38.104 --> 01:40.738
It's not. We should cut our losses
and get the hell out.

01:40.740 --> 01:42.940
Well, I like Dr. Sanders...

01:42.942 --> 01:46.242
But this whole thing is becoming
more complex than I'd hoped.

01:46.244 --> 01:50.346
Quentin, start exploring
the best way for us move on.

01:50.348 --> 01:54.850
Without damaging Sanders' reputation.
Or mine.

01:59.123 --> 02:03.926
I'll try to make it today,
but I don't think I can...

02:03.928 --> 02:07.663
Like I told you, I'm working
on a special assignment.

02:07.665 --> 02:11.232
Well, Daddy loves you too, Sawyer.
More than anything.

02:12.903 --> 02:16.505
Well, you have fun today
at the art fair, okay princess?

02:16.507 --> 02:18.772
Make sure you send me
a few pictures.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.279
I'll call you later, okay?

02:30.886 --> 02:34.721
- Hey, better eat your breakfast.
- I gotta get ready for school.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:43.397 --> 02:46.132
- Are you all right?
- No.

02:46.134 --> 02:48.869
I can't stop thinking about Angela.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.507
Come here.
We need to talk.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.712
We need to find out which school
is having an art fair today.

02:59.714 --> 03:01.973
What? An art fair? Why?

03:02.023 --> 03:03.431
He has a daughter.
Her name is Sawyer.

03:03.523 --> 03:06.318
Her school is having an art fair.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.020
I'll try and track it down at work.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.522
Use someone else's computer
in case they're tapping.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.192
I'll call you at 11:15.

03:15.761 --> 03:17.396
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:17.398 --> 03:21.433
I didn't hear back from you last night.
Everything go okay with the nurse?

03:21.435 --> 03:24.167
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

03:37.816 --> 03:38.940
Duncan?

03:38.981 --> 03:40.883
I'm at the meeting spot.
Where are you?

03:40.886 --> 03:42.019
Meeting spot?

03:45.356 --> 03:47.359
You just sent me an urgent message.

03:49.593 --> 03:51.840
I didn't send you a message.

03:56.766 --> 03:58.000
Duncan?

04:13.416 --> 04:15.417
- Who ordered the hit?
- Calm down.

04:15.419 --> 04:17.567
It was that bootlicking
Chief of Staff, Creasy.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.086
I'll bury that son of a bitch.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.123
Duncan. Stop.
You need to stay focused.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.859
Think about your daughter.
Your wife.

04:24.861 --> 04:27.260
Remember why we're doing this.

04:35.970 --> 04:40.073
You're right.
It doesn't matter who gave the order.

04:42.109 --> 04:44.042
It only matters why...

04:48.648 --> 04:53.451
The President must be moving on...
Changing surgeons.

04:54.955 --> 04:58.156
- Without Sanders...
- The deal's off.

04:58.158 --> 05:01.226
Which makes us all liabilities.
You, me, Sanders...

05:09.835 --> 05:12.536
Unless we change
the President's mind.

05:18.310 --> 05:21.112
Yes, I'd like to speak to
Chief of Staff Quentin Creasy.

05:21.114 --> 05:23.346
Tell him it's Rob Halsey.

05:25.417 --> 05:29.553
Mr. Creasy?
I have a Mr. Halsey for you on line two.

05:29.555 --> 05:31.821
Tell him I'm out of the office.

05:31.823 --> 05:35.657
I'm sorry, Mr. Halsey.
The Chief of Staff is unavailable.

05:45.302 --> 05:47.802
I thought Carlisle
was supposed to be dead.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.250
- Dr. Sanders.
- Agent Hoffman.

06:28.252 --> 06:30.352
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.

06:31.054 --> 06:33.088
I know you and Angela were close.

06:33.090 --> 06:37.225
Yeah, I just... I can't believe it.
It's horrible.

06:37.227 --> 06:40.128
Until we find a body
there's still hope.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.729
Yeah, you're right, I...

06:43.366 --> 06:45.733
Why were you at her house
last night?

06:47.337 --> 06:50.737
We were supposed to meet for a drink
and she didn't show up to the bar.

06:50.739 --> 06:54.275
I went to her home
because I was concerned.

06:54.277 --> 06:58.745
- About what?
- About Angela. She was distressed.

06:58.747 --> 07:01.782
We had coffee yesterday
and she was just so upset

07:01.784 --> 07:03.717
about everything that's happened
with the President.

07:03.719 --> 07:07.187
Especially since she was the nurse
administering the medication.

07:11.392 --> 07:14.760
She didn't know whether
she'd made a mistake or not.

07:14.762 --> 07:18.031
I told her if she thought she was at fault,
she should just admit it.

07:18.033 --> 07:19.466
But she...

07:21.401 --> 07:22.401
What?

07:25.738 --> 07:29.174
She didn't know if she could live
with the consequences.

07:29.176 --> 07:32.577
I feel terrible. I should have done more.
Been a better friend.

07:32.579 --> 07:36.414
- I just, I had no idea...
- Don't blame yourself, Doctor.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.917
Something like this?
How could you possibly know?

07:51.230 --> 07:53.796
Let's go!
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.

07:54.533 --> 07:58.535
Hey. Did you look in my father's
bathroom for the money?

07:58.537 --> 07:59.536
No.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.532
Oh, my God.
Nico is gonna kill me.

08:03.603 --> 08:06.359
Give me a break. The guy sells
schwag weed to high school kids,

08:06.394 --> 08:08.243
how tough can he be?

08:08.313 --> 08:11.614
- I'm not going to school today.
- Sure you are.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.416
Come on. Move it.

08:27.030 --> 08:29.364
Have you talked to the boss yet?

08:29.366 --> 08:31.700
- Haven't had a chance.
- I don't do charity work.

08:31.702 --> 08:32.900
Yeah, neither do I.

08:33.903 --> 08:35.904
With this kind of risk...

08:35.905 --> 08:39.407
The President? Keeping a family
under wraps for two weeks?

08:39.409 --> 08:41.909
- We need to get paid.
- I said, I'll take care of it.

08:46.382 --> 08:48.415
Who the hell is this guy, anyway?

08:52.554 --> 08:55.671
His name is Duncan Carlisle.
He's a good man.

08:55.758 --> 08:58.692
You keep saying that, but so far
I haven't seen any evidence.

08:58.694 --> 09:01.527
I have. 13 years ago
I was working security

09:01.529 --> 09:03.797
for a US petrol outfit
near the Colombian border.

09:03.799 --> 09:06.967
Got attacked by FARC guerillas.
Held for two months.

09:06.969 --> 09:10.236
FBI sent a team to get us out.
Duncan was the lead negotiator.

09:10.238 --> 09:11.938
So he negotiated a release?

09:13.239 --> 09:15.107
It was a commando raid.

09:16.776 --> 09:18.644
It got ugly.

09:18.646 --> 09:21.279
Freed all the oil men.
Now they're in choppers, ready to go.

09:21.281 --> 09:24.483
When Duncan found out I was being
held separately, he came back.

09:25.819 --> 09:28.820
Shot his way in one more time.
Saved my life.

09:31.289 --> 09:32.456
Impressive.

09:33.558 --> 09:35.193
But I still need to get paid.

09:39.152 --> 09:41.755
Morgan. Morgan.

09:42.968 --> 09:45.235
What are you doing here?

09:45.237 --> 09:48.105
You wouldn't answer my texts
or my calls last night.

09:48.107 --> 09:49.539
I need to talk to you.

09:49.541 --> 09:52.308
You really shouldn't be here, okay?
Just go before somebody...

09:52.310 --> 09:55.112
- Boyd, please don't do this right now.
- What's going on?

09:56.114 --> 09:57.413
Why are you acting like this?

09:59.517 --> 10:02.018
Is there somebody else?

10:02.020 --> 10:05.121
No, no there's...
God, no, there's nobody else.

10:05.123 --> 10:07.857
Then just tell me the truth,
because I love you.

10:07.859 --> 10:10.960
I think about you
every minute of every day.

10:10.962 --> 10:14.430
- So if there's someone else...
- I'm pregnant.

10:45.060 --> 10:48.169
I understand, but,
$55 a square foot is a steal.

10:48.204 --> 10:50.141
Comps are at 60.

10:50.231 --> 10:54.367
Oh, okay. All right.
No, no, I get it.

10:54.369 --> 10:57.036
If you change your mind,
give me a call.

11:41.446 --> 11:42.765
Since you won't take my calls

11:42.770 --> 11:44.457
I had to find another way
to get your attention.

11:44.531 --> 11:45.628
What the hell are you doing?

11:45.664 --> 11:48.093
That bullet missed my head
by five inches.

11:48.154 --> 11:49.285
What are you talking about?

11:49.322 --> 11:51.509
Bad idea to play dumb
with me right now, Quentin.

11:52.024 --> 11:53.345
I'm not in the mood.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.422
I have no idea
why you're acting this way.

11:55.460 --> 11:58.261
None. Please, just
tell me what happened.

11:58.263 --> 12:01.330
I don't care if you knew, if you
gave the order... It doesn't matter.

12:01.332 --> 12:05.368
- All I care about is what happens next.
- Next?

12:05.370 --> 12:07.515
We're gonna find a way out of this,
you and me,

12:07.587 --> 12:11.492
so you need to do exactly as I say.

12:12.208 --> 12:16.577
If not, my friends will kill you.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.347
And then...

12:22.085 --> 12:24.552
They're gonna kill
your beautiful wife.

12:36.831 --> 12:37.997
It's me.

12:39.232 --> 12:41.768
Something's come up.

12:41.770 --> 12:45.271
I think we should reconsider the
decision to terminate the operation.

12:47.273 --> 12:49.108
Because I've just learned

12:49.181 --> 12:51.623
that the President
is going to remain with Dr. Sanders,

12:51.745 --> 12:54.245
so the original plan is still viable.

12:55.615 --> 12:57.248
Yes, I'm positive.

13:02.154 --> 13:04.755
You're safe. For now.

13:05.757 --> 13:08.726
Good.

13:08.728 --> 13:13.030
That means you're safe, too.
For now.

13:13.032 --> 13:15.766
You realize we're both
out on a limb here.

13:15.768 --> 13:19.302
I've just lied to some very powerful,
very unforgiving people.

13:19.304 --> 13:23.544
If you do as I say,
it won't be a lie for long.

14:10.552 --> 14:13.754
- I found a great hotel in Miami.
- Miami?

14:13.756 --> 14:16.823
For the real estate conference
we're going to in a few weeks?

14:16.825 --> 14:18.291
Hey, Brian?

14:18.293 --> 14:19.927
It's Ellen,
she's been trying to reach you.

14:19.929 --> 14:22.395
Oh, yeah, right.
I dropped my phone yesterday.

14:22.397 --> 14:25.998
Nightmare. I told her she
could reach me through you.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.266
Yeah, sure.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.302
Oh, go ahead.
You should take that.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.507
Hey, can I borrow your office
for two minutes?

14:35.509 --> 14:36.809
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.612
- Ellen?
- What'd you find?

14:40.614 --> 14:44.382
There's an art fair at a private school
called Holly Oak in Bethesda.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.292
Okay, good. Holly Oak.
What time?

14:46.326 --> 14:48.578
1:30. Why?
You're not planning on going?

14:48.613 --> 14:50.288
Well, we need to figure out
who this man is.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.592
- They're watching us at all times.
- I'll find a way.

14:53.594 --> 14:56.660
- No, Ellen, don't, it's too dangerous.
- I gotta go.

14:56.662 --> 14:57.661
Ellen!

15:08.107 --> 15:10.074
This is strictly off the record.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.943
- Can I say unnamed White House source?
- Unnamed government source.

15:14.579 --> 15:17.081
There's no negotiation,
you understand?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.116
- Coffee?
- No. Thank you.

15:23.822 --> 15:26.389
The President is changing doctors.

15:26.391 --> 15:30.626
His upcoming surgery will take place
at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.

15:31.261 --> 15:32.828
That's official?

15:34.998 --> 15:36.710
He's not worried
about the political fallout?

15:36.747 --> 15:38.617
He's worried about his health.

15:38.937 --> 15:42.005
After all those sanctimonious
speeches about health care reform,

15:42.007 --> 15:45.111
the impeccable quality
of our nation's public hospitals?

15:45.145 --> 15:47.245
One glitch and out the door.

15:47.277 --> 15:52.447
- You owe me one, Tom.
- Yeah.

15:52.449 --> 15:57.218
- What's your upside on this?
- I'm trying to protect the President.

15:57.220 --> 16:00.820
Make sure his decision's in the best
interest of the American people.

16:03.224 --> 16:04.891
I'll be seeing you.

16:32.553 --> 16:35.921
Ellen. Didn't expect to see you,
thought you might take some time off.

16:35.923 --> 16:38.590
Especially after Angela.
Very sad.

16:38.592 --> 16:40.825
I'd rather stay busy, you know?

16:42.962 --> 16:47.804
- How's your schedule?
- Crazy. Five surgeries, back to back.

16:50.736 --> 16:52.551
Good luck.

17:43.019 --> 17:45.520
Do you know where you get
your parking validated?

17:48.625 --> 17:51.092
All right, switch ends.

17:53.763 --> 17:55.496
Pick it up!

17:55.498 --> 17:59.533
Hey. I need the money back.

17:59.535 --> 18:01.469
The cash you found hidden
in the equipment locker?

18:01.471 --> 18:03.604
The beer money?
Are you kidding me?

18:03.606 --> 18:04.993
It wasn't mine, okay?

18:05.008 --> 18:08.209
- I owe a bunch of kids money.
- Well, tough.

18:08.211 --> 18:11.145
- But, Dad...
- Everything that's going on right now?

18:11.147 --> 18:14.295
I don't wanna hear another word.

18:19.788 --> 18:21.954
All right, let's bring it in.

18:51.851 --> 18:54.285
I'm so excited to see the kids' art!

18:57.056 --> 18:59.189
So what's your name, anyway?

19:01.159 --> 19:02.527
Kramer.

19:04.262 --> 19:05.396
Sandrine.

19:19.777 --> 19:22.178
What's up, Jake?

19:22.180 --> 19:24.936
Where you been,
on vacation or something?

19:27.719 --> 19:30.325
Hey, Nico, I'm really, really sorry.

19:30.401 --> 19:32.521
I've been super busy
with family stuff.

19:32.556 --> 19:35.176
Oh, totally get it.
Yeah, family always comes first.

19:35.254 --> 19:36.502
Absolutely.

19:36.537 --> 19:39.795
Unless, of course, you owe somebody money.
Then, that person comes first.

19:39.797 --> 19:41.496
Make sense?

19:42.599 --> 19:46.968
- Yeah. Like I said, I'm really sorry.
- I need my money, Jake.

19:50.539 --> 19:54.308
I'll have it soon, I promise.
It's just...

19:54.310 --> 19:56.143
Someone stole it?

19:56.225 --> 19:59.782
So I'm just gonna need a few more days,
if that's okay.

19:59.816 --> 20:03.725
Oh, sure. Totally cool.
Take your time.

20:04.520 --> 20:08.889
- How long you need? A week? A month?
- A week would be awesome.

20:08.891 --> 20:11.371
No worries.

20:17.398 --> 20:19.802
What the hell are you doing?
He's getting his ass kicked.

20:19.839 --> 20:21.245
Not our problem.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.968
We stay put, you understand?

20:50.562 --> 20:52.596
- Can I help you?
- Oh.

20:52.598 --> 20:54.818
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

20:54.892 --> 20:56.336
I'm fine, I...

20:56.569 --> 20:59.470
I was just staring at these
class photos, they're so cute!

20:59.472 --> 21:03.974
- Are you a Holly Oak parent?
- Uh, no, I'm a Holly Oak aunt.

21:03.976 --> 21:06.808
I'm actually looking
for my niece, Sawyer?

21:06.876 --> 21:08.494
Sawyer Carlisle?

21:08.529 --> 21:11.948
- She used to do ballet with my youngest.
- Oh, great!

21:11.950 --> 21:16.417
- Have you seen her?
- I did, uh, just a moment ago...

21:26.062 --> 21:28.096
There she is. Over there.

21:32.335 --> 21:34.446
I hope you and Sawyer
have a terrific day.

21:34.471 --> 21:36.103
Thank you.

21:40.476 --> 21:41.576
Sawyer?

21:43.745 --> 21:45.947
Sawyer, is that you?

21:55.690 --> 21:57.817
Who are you?

21:58.526 --> 22:00.425
My name is Jane.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.345
I'm a friend of your father's.

22:16.909 --> 22:19.578
You've grown so much.
I hardly recognized you.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.548
How do you know my dad?

22:22.550 --> 22:25.050
We used to work together.

22:26.118 --> 22:27.586
Jane is a funny name.

22:27.588 --> 22:31.789
Really? When I was growing up,
it was considered very boring.

22:31.791 --> 22:33.783
There were five Janes in my class.

22:33.857 --> 22:35.863
It was like having
the name Emma today.

22:36.458 --> 22:39.196
But you want to hear
the funniest name of anyone I know?

22:39.532 --> 22:41.199
Marsley.

22:41.201 --> 22:42.300
Marsley?

22:42.302 --> 22:45.102
Yeah. It's like "parsley",
except with an "M."

22:45.337 --> 22:47.637
That is a funny name.

22:51.909 --> 22:53.976
Is your mother here?

22:56.647 --> 22:59.606
Attention, everybody.
It's time for the main event.

22:59.741 --> 23:02.885
So kids, grab your parents,
grandparents or special friends,

23:02.887 --> 23:06.088
and take them to your classrooms
to show them what you've done.

23:07.091 --> 23:12.006
- Want to see my art?
- Yes. I would love to.

23:19.769 --> 23:21.613
Mr. Sanders!

23:22.047 --> 23:25.029
It's Jake.
You gotta come quick!

23:28.711 --> 23:30.778
Hey! Jake!

23:32.148 --> 23:33.548
Jake!

23:35.016 --> 23:37.518
Buddy? Come here.

23:38.954 --> 23:41.255
Oh, my God, look at you.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.374
Too little too late, pops.

24:01.376 --> 24:04.978
Forget lacrosse.
Your kid needs boxing lessons.

24:04.980 --> 24:07.112
I mean, he didn't even
get one punch in.

24:07.114 --> 24:09.326
He just stood there like a dumbass.

24:09.366 --> 24:12.610
What was he expecting? A kiss?

24:12.752 --> 24:14.619
Well, he got up, didn't he?

24:14.621 --> 24:17.122
Sometimes, that's good enough.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.432
Was that good enough for you?

24:19.993 --> 24:21.293
Excuse me?

24:21.295 --> 24:22.727
You seem to relate to this kid.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.595
That mean you're a preppy,
suburban punk

24:24.597 --> 24:27.312
who used to get his ass kicked, too?

24:28.333 --> 24:30.333
Why are you here?

24:31.403 --> 24:33.404
None of your business.

24:35.107 --> 24:39.209
Look, Kramer,
you seem like a nice guy.

24:39.211 --> 24:43.569
But this job we're doing here
is not the kind of thing nice guys do.

24:47.018 --> 24:48.951
Which one did you draw?

24:50.889 --> 24:54.590
That is beautiful.
You're such a good artist, Sawyer.

24:54.592 --> 24:57.476
Your mother must be so proud.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.400
What's the matter, honey?

25:05.402 --> 25:07.436
Are you sad because
your mother isn't here?

25:09.272 --> 25:11.672
Mommy is sick.

25:12.875 --> 25:17.510
Well, I'm sure the doctor is
gonna help make her feel better.

25:18.547 --> 25:20.815
How do you know?

25:20.817 --> 25:25.854
Because that's what doctors do,
they help sick people get better.

25:25.856 --> 25:29.189
They've been trying, but...

25:31.125 --> 25:33.093
Do you know
what's wrong with her?

25:37.332 --> 25:38.765
Is she in the hospital?

25:41.970 --> 25:44.703
Do you know which hospital?

25:51.578 --> 25:55.046
She's going to be just fine, Sawyer.
I promise.

25:57.017 --> 26:01.452
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you draw me a picture?

26:01.454 --> 26:03.421
Would you do that for me?

26:03.423 --> 26:06.958
Okay. What should I draw?

26:06.960 --> 26:11.673
How about a picture of your family?

26:13.132 --> 26:15.366
- How the hell did this get leaked?
- I'll find out.

26:15.368 --> 26:16.533
Son of a bitch.

26:16.535 --> 26:18.235
"The President's
self-serving hypocrisy

26:18.237 --> 26:20.037
"is only surpassed by his
shameless cowardice."

26:20.039 --> 26:21.338
Unbelievable, sir.

26:21.340 --> 26:24.574
How about if we turn all this
nonsense into a victory?

26:24.576 --> 26:26.443
How do you suggest we do that?

26:26.445 --> 26:29.079
We announce that changing
doctors or changing hospitals

26:29.081 --> 26:31.147
was never even a consideration,

26:31.149 --> 26:33.883
given my unbreakable faith
in the public health care system

26:33.885 --> 26:36.019
and Dr. Ellen Sanders.

26:36.021 --> 26:37.653
I think you're dead on, sir.

26:37.655 --> 26:40.790
That would completely discredit
this journalist and his source,

26:40.792 --> 26:44.260
and, most importantly,
silence your critics.

26:44.262 --> 26:48.897
Might even make a few new fans.
American people do love bravery.

26:59.375 --> 27:01.109
- Yeah?
- Good news.

27:01.111 --> 27:03.377
The President is livid
over the press coverage.

27:03.379 --> 27:04.845
That mean he's sticking
with Sanders?

27:04.847 --> 27:06.141
Correct.

27:06.179 --> 27:09.621
When this is over, Duncan,
you should consider getting into politics.

27:09.752 --> 27:11.617
You're actually quite good at this.

28:03.603 --> 28:06.451
Mr. Sanders.

28:07.706 --> 28:09.773
Hi.

28:09.775 --> 28:13.343
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
anybody was home.

28:13.345 --> 28:16.580
I was looking for Morgan.
My name is Boyd.

28:19.718 --> 28:23.019
I'd like to, um...
If I may...

28:24.522 --> 28:27.456
Can I talk to you about
your daughter, sir?

28:42.739 --> 28:44.172
Hi, can I help you?

28:44.174 --> 28:46.374
Yes, I'm looking for someone.

28:53.550 --> 28:56.150
Morgan and I have been dating
for three months.

28:56.152 --> 28:58.819
And I wasn't planning
on meeting you like this.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.856
But it's time I introduced myself
anyway.

29:01.858 --> 29:03.857
Right. Well.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.393
Nice to meet you.

29:07.462 --> 29:10.097
Sir, I love your daughter.

29:10.099 --> 29:12.666
I dropped out of high school,
but I've been working hard

29:12.668 --> 29:14.168
to get my career back on track.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.470
I'm working for a
construction company, so...

29:16.472 --> 29:19.257
I can definitely support Morgan

29:19.292 --> 29:23.660
if we were to get more serious
at some point.

29:26.113 --> 29:28.013
Look, what I'm trying to say,
Mr. Sanders...

29:28.015 --> 29:30.916
Let me stop you there, son.
Morgan is in high school.

29:30.918 --> 29:32.385
On her way to college.

29:32.387 --> 29:35.720
So the answer is no.
She's too young for marriage.

29:35.722 --> 29:38.190
She's got her
whole life in front of her.

29:38.192 --> 29:40.459
- But I love her.
- I'm sure you do.

29:40.461 --> 29:41.960
But it's time to move on.

29:43.596 --> 29:45.362
What if I don't?

29:50.335 --> 29:52.903
You got guts, kid.

29:52.905 --> 29:54.871
I respect that.

30:00.912 --> 30:04.115
But stay away from my daughter.

30:04.117 --> 30:07.049
Never come back
to this house again.

30:07.818 --> 30:08.985
Understand?

30:23.533 --> 30:25.734
There. All done.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.202
That's amazing.

30:27.204 --> 30:30.117
You really are a terrific artist.

30:34.177 --> 30:38.679
That's your mommy, that's you,
and that's your daddy?

30:38.681 --> 30:39.847
Mmm-hmm.

30:41.683 --> 30:43.017
What is that? His heart?

30:43.019 --> 30:44.619
No. That's his badge.

30:45.654 --> 30:47.188
His badge?

30:47.190 --> 30:50.728
My daddy works for the FBI.

31:28.433 --> 31:30.934
Almost done.
Be there in a few minutes.

31:30.936 --> 31:35.070
If what I've just heard is true,
don't bother coming up at all.

31:35.072 --> 31:36.806
Uh-oh. What did I do now?

31:36.808 --> 31:38.873
I'm not amused, Paul.

31:39.642 --> 31:41.177
Mary, I don't understand, what?

31:41.179 --> 31:43.045
I've just spoken with
the White House Physician.

31:43.047 --> 31:45.781
He tells me you're sticking
with Dr. Sanders.

31:45.783 --> 31:49.083
Well, she's a terrific surgeon.
The more I thought about it,

31:49.085 --> 31:51.620
the more I came to believe
this is the right move.

31:51.622 --> 31:54.323
The right move?
For your approval rating or your health?

31:54.325 --> 31:58.293
Madam First Lady, it's a bit
more complicated than that.

31:58.295 --> 32:02.431
How about we talk about this later on?
In private?

32:02.433 --> 32:04.732
How about now?

32:04.734 --> 32:08.802
Now sounds even better, darling.
Give us a few moments.

32:11.807 --> 32:14.374
So good to see you, Quentin.

32:26.220 --> 32:27.721
- I... I just...
- In five minutes,

32:27.723 --> 32:29.622
you're gonna get a call
from the White House

32:29.624 --> 32:32.257
saying the President wants to meet
to discuss his upcoming surgery.

32:32.292 --> 32:34.472
He's going to fire you.

32:34.695 --> 32:37.047
Are you sure?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.499
What do I do?

32:40.501 --> 32:43.301
Convince him to change his mind.

32:43.303 --> 32:47.437
More importantly, convince his wife.

32:58.584 --> 33:00.451
The President will be here shortly.

33:04.089 --> 33:08.942
On behalf of the American people,
I'd like to thank you.

33:09.060 --> 33:10.694
For what?

33:10.696 --> 33:12.897
For saving the President's life.

33:12.899 --> 33:17.582
If it weren't for you,
he might be dead right now.

33:19.137 --> 33:23.330
Thank you.
But I was just doing my job.

33:53.002 --> 33:57.172
- Beautiful painting, isn't it?
- Hello. It's nice to see you again.

33:57.174 --> 34:01.309
President Garfield.
Served only two hundred days.

34:01.311 --> 34:03.077
Second shortest term ever.

34:03.079 --> 34:04.660
Oh, I didn't know that.

34:04.698 --> 34:07.479
I'm not much of an historian,
I'm afraid.

34:08.382 --> 34:12.520
He was assassinated.
In 1881.

34:12.522 --> 34:15.222
Do you know who he was with
on the day he was shot?

34:15.224 --> 34:17.625
President Lincoln's son, Robert.

34:18.460 --> 34:20.694
What are the odds?

34:20.696 --> 34:24.431
You aren't talking about the
Garfield-Lincoln thing again, are you?

34:24.434 --> 34:28.335
I find the historical coincidence
absolutely fascinating.

34:28.338 --> 34:31.603
Dr. Sanders. Thank you for coming
over on such short notice.

34:31.606 --> 34:34.007
- Of course.
- Please. Have a seat.

34:43.317 --> 34:44.985
You okay, buddy?

34:48.521 --> 34:51.255
Just tell me what happened.
How did it start?

34:51.257 --> 34:54.159
I don't want to talk about it.

34:54.161 --> 34:55.927
Jake.

34:55.929 --> 34:58.697
It's just some kid. Okay?
It doesn't matter.

34:58.699 --> 35:01.000
Well, fights don't happen
out of nowhere.

35:01.002 --> 35:05.769
Was it something you said?
Over a girl?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.370
No.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.840
It was over money.

35:09.842 --> 35:11.642
The beer money?

35:11.644 --> 35:16.114
Yes! I needed that money.
That's what I was trying to tell you!

35:16.116 --> 35:18.915
Jake, Jake.
I'm sorry. Jake!

35:34.064 --> 35:35.664
You got a minute?

35:36.933 --> 35:39.267
What's the deal
with this guy Kramer?

35:40.769 --> 35:46.174
He's someone I trust.
Someone we can count on.

35:46.176 --> 35:49.811
He's an amateur.
He'll crack under pressure.

35:53.015 --> 35:54.982
He'll do a good job.

35:56.484 --> 35:59.753
I have nothing but
respect for you, Dr. Sanders,

35:59.755 --> 36:01.655
not only for your skill as a surgeon,

36:01.657 --> 36:03.590
but also for the way
you have conducted yourself

36:03.592 --> 36:05.625
throughout this entire circus.

36:07.028 --> 36:10.397
However,
in light of recent events,

36:10.399 --> 36:14.133
I have decided to switch to a surgeon
at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.

36:14.135 --> 36:17.236
It would be best if this
announcement came from you.

36:17.238 --> 36:19.338
We'll arrange a press conference

36:19.340 --> 36:23.909
and you will announce
that this is your decision.

36:23.911 --> 36:26.479
That you believe it's in the
best interest of your patient,

36:26.481 --> 36:30.723
and the hospital,
to make this move.

36:34.387 --> 36:36.321
Of course, Mr. President.

36:36.323 --> 36:38.847
If that's what you think is best.

36:44.262 --> 36:46.630
But you are making a mistake.

36:48.266 --> 36:50.568
The reason you want
to change doctors

36:50.570 --> 36:53.537
is the exact reason
you should remain with me.

36:54.672 --> 36:57.741
I caught the error
that could have killed you.

36:57.743 --> 37:00.577
I've never lost a patient
in surgery. Ever.

37:00.579 --> 37:03.279
And I don't intend to.

37:03.281 --> 37:05.939
I don't know much about politics,
Mr. President.

37:06.017 --> 37:08.694
Or art, Madam First Lady.

37:08.952 --> 37:12.255
But I do know medicine.

37:12.257 --> 37:13.756
What I'm saying is,

37:13.758 --> 37:16.958
I am the best thoracic surgeon
you're going to find.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.195
If this were my husband's life,
I would want a surgeon

37:20.197 --> 37:22.564
who has the confidence
in her abilities

37:22.566 --> 37:24.766
to say to the most powerful
man in the world

37:24.768 --> 37:27.402
that he'd be a fool
to choose someone else.

37:44.653 --> 37:46.287
Your girl delivered.

37:47.289 --> 37:49.088
Kincaid is staying put.

37:50.458 --> 37:53.527
- So we're back on track?
- Yes.

37:53.529 --> 37:55.428
We're back on track.

37:58.466 --> 38:03.236
I want you to know, it was
not my idea to take you out.

38:03.238 --> 38:05.137
That order came from someone else

38:05.139 --> 38:08.407
higher up the chain.
I didn't even know about it.

38:08.409 --> 38:10.141
You believe me?

38:13.313 --> 38:14.846
No.

38:15.549 --> 38:17.415
Not for a second.

38:28.661 --> 38:30.795
Why do you have to be such a jerk?

38:30.797 --> 38:32.997
What did you just say?

38:34.900 --> 38:37.501
Okay, look, I know why you
told him to stay away,

38:37.503 --> 38:39.203
but you didn't have to
treat him like dirt, you know.

38:39.205 --> 38:40.737
What the hell are you
talking about?

38:40.739 --> 38:44.140
- Boyd.
- Who's Boyd?

38:44.342 --> 38:46.533
Really?

38:47.212 --> 38:48.625
Oh, my God.

38:50.181 --> 38:52.381
Thanks for going
by the school today.

38:53.550 --> 38:56.485
Was she happy to see
her favorite uncle?

38:56.487 --> 39:00.856
Yeah, she was good.
She was happy, she was smiling.

39:00.858 --> 39:02.225
Kid can draw.

39:04.361 --> 39:06.128
Takes after her mom, no doubt.

39:09.932 --> 39:15.036
Oh, Jake...
Are you okay?

39:16.071 --> 39:18.573
Oh, let me look at you.

39:18.575 --> 39:19.974
Sweetheart.

39:54.141 --> 39:56.508
Can I help you, brother?

39:56.510 --> 39:59.144
Hey, yeah, hope so.
I was hoping to buy some weed.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.381
Weed? Why you think we
have any weed?

40:02.383 --> 40:04.249
A friend told me to check you out.

40:04.251 --> 40:06.708
He said you got the good stuff.

40:08.187 --> 40:09.354
Are you a cop?

40:10.523 --> 40:11.556
No.

40:13.358 --> 40:14.825
What's your friend's name?

40:14.827 --> 40:16.860
Oh, it's uh, Jake.

40:21.567 --> 40:23.734
You want some? Huh?

40:23.736 --> 40:26.103
Well, it's not really your problem,
is it?

40:28.707 --> 40:31.808
Aah! Stop! Stop!

40:31.810 --> 40:34.143
Stop, stop.

40:36.047 --> 40:39.448
You stay away from Jake.
You understand?

40:40.884 --> 40:43.019
He works for me now.

41:00.137 --> 41:03.037
Oh, Brian.

41:04.272 --> 41:06.374
I can't take much more of this.

41:06.376 --> 41:08.476
I met his daughter.

41:08.478 --> 41:09.977
Did you find out who he is?

41:09.979 --> 41:12.447
His name is Carlisle.
He's an FBI Agent.

41:12.449 --> 41:13.848
What?

41:13.850 --> 41:16.016
She drew a picture of his badge.

41:16.018 --> 41:17.951
I can't believe you even went there.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.252
How'd you get out of the hospital?

41:19.254 --> 41:20.520
Aren't they watching you?

41:20.522 --> 41:23.547
I slipped away.
Made them think I was in surgery.

41:25.292 --> 41:27.553
Can you do it again?

41:28.896 --> 41:31.464
I think so. Why?

41:33.700 --> 41:36.079
'Cause, um...

41:39.973 --> 41:43.108
Because, uh...

41:43.110 --> 41:45.077
We're going to escape.

41:45.079 --> 41:46.812
- What?
- Yeah.

41:46.814 --> 41:48.980
I mean, you think he's really going
to let us go when this is over?

41:48.982 --> 41:51.616
You do everything he wants,
he's still going to kill us.

41:51.618 --> 41:54.386
We can do this. We can get away.
But we just have to do it soon.

41:54.388 --> 41:57.589
They can't watch everybody, all the time.
They're not perfect, right?

41:57.591 --> 42:01.761
But how do we...
It's not that simple to just run away.

42:01.994 --> 42:05.328
I'll stay behind,
I'll act as a decoy.

42:05.330 --> 42:06.830
No. I'm not leaving you here.

42:06.832 --> 42:08.399
- Listen to me. Ellen.
- It's dangerous, forget it.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.966
I won't do it.

42:20.244 --> 42:22.355
You know I love you, right?

42:23.280 --> 42:25.068
Of course.

42:27.217 --> 42:29.638
I'm having an affair.

42:30.721 --> 42:32.695
With Samantha.

42:39.463 --> 42:44.098
Samantha?
The woman you work with?

42:53.207 --> 42:54.907
Look...

42:55.944 --> 42:58.111
Why are you telling me this?

42:58.113 --> 43:05.514
Because I want to do the right thing.
For you and for the kids.

43:07.388 --> 43:10.601
Please. Ellen.

43:12.254 --> 43:14.962
Let me do this.
