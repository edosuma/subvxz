00:13.346 --> 00:17.100
My marriage to Liam is completely legal,
which means ours isn't.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.310
Neither is my contract.
Read the fine print.

00:19.394 --> 00:23.064
Morell Corp and 25 percent
of Colbyco are still mine.

00:23.148 --> 00:26.234
Michael resigned this morning.
I have more bad news.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.820
-This is Culhane's place.
-Not anymore.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.948
You don't know.
Culhane's father is quite ill, sir.

00:32.031 --> 00:36.369
If Culhane realizes the connection between
his father's disease and CA's cover-up,

00:36.453 --> 00:38.830
it might not be easy to handle this time.

00:38.913 --> 00:43.543
You're not the first-born Carrington,
Steven. There was a baby boy.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.754
His name was Adam. He was kidnapped.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.173
A PI had tracked him to El Paso.

00:48.256 --> 00:51.801
-We can't be friends?
-You don't qualify for that position.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.928
-I'm told I'm a terrible friend.
-Not true.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.056

-Going away?
-I'm going to D.C.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.736
to meet with our federal reps

01:52.737 --> 01:55.031
about getting more technology education
in schools.

-And I am doubly glad to join you--
-Oh, God.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.377
Too late.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.711
Can you pass the orange juice, Celia?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.550
-Rude.
-Oh, sorry. Cristal.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.511
A little birdie told me
that you used to go by Celia.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.762
I see why you changed it.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.849
Sounds like that disease
when people pretend they can't eat bread.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.309
I'll take my breakfast upstairs.

02:25.436 --> 02:29.065
What? Lots of people go by other names.
Nicknames, middle names.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.526
Hmm, this is a fun ice-breaker.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.569

02:35.196 --> 02:36.364
-It's--
-Doesn't have one.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.616
You sure about that, Fallon?

02:38.992 --> 02:42.245
Takes longer to adopt a dog
than it took my daughter to marry you.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.122
[Fallon] Okay, we're tapping out, too.

02:44.205 --> 02:49.043
But if Liam and I need any advice
on how to grow old alone, we'll ping you.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.880
Steven,
I'll miss you at the La Perla party.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.174
-Buy me something Dad wouldn't wear.
-It's the women's line, but okay.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.095
Want me to come?
Bought a pair of Italian leather oxfords.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.723
They'd look good
strolling the National Mall.

03:01.806 --> 03:04.309
It's not the kind of mall you think it is.

03:05.935 --> 03:06.895
Maybe next time.

03:07.604 --> 03:11.816
Call me when you get there.
I hope you find what we're looking for.

[Alexis sighs]

03:22.827 --> 03:24.495
Where is all the help?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.749
Wow. Breakfast in your house
is a contact sport.

03:27.832 --> 03:31.002
Oh, breakfast is the under card.
Dinner is most dangerous.

03:31.085 --> 03:34.505
Look, speaking of...
I wanted to ask you a question.

03:34.797 --> 03:35.632
Uh-oh.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.217
It's nothing bad, I hope.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.595
It's just awkward,
because we're already married.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.180
HPV? I'm vaccinated.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.893
Our fake marriage contract ends soon.
Before I turn back into a frog,

03:46.976 --> 03:48.645
we could have a date.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.438
Tomorrow night?

03:50.813 --> 03:52.774
Oh. No.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.485
I can't, because of the La Perla thing.

03:55.568 --> 03:59.489
Right, right. That.
That doesn't require my attendance?

03:59.572 --> 04:01.783
-It's not in your contract, no.
-Okay. I could spare time tonight for my spouse.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.914
-Where to? The Optimist? Aria?
-I thought I'd cook for us.

04:09.123 --> 04:09.958
Oh.

Wouldn't it be funny
if just as our contract ends,

-we actually--?
-Shh. Don't jinx it. See you at 8.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.763

06:44.195 --> 06:47.156

to those patients is weak.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.283
Because CA made it look weak.

It's an epidemic.
We have to come forward with this.

It'd trigger a class-action lawsuit
that'd cripple the company.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.669

Not because of Botox. He's too young.

I never did that.
I'd tell you to hike it shorter.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.594
I wanna talk to you about Liam.
Are you sure his name is Liam?

12:33.043 --> 12:37.006
-Is that braised lamb chops?
-Grass-fed on the Coromandel Peninsula.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.466
I thought I smelled home.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.219
Paired with a Chilean Cabernet.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.014
Well done, young man.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.938
-Dinner over so soon?
-I need to talk to Culhane.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.983
-You know which hospital his father is in?
-I do.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.237
I can see that you're upset.
How about I drive?

13:04.992 --> 13:09.914
I hate to drag you out so late, Jim,
but this is an urgent and sensitive issue.

13:09.997 --> 13:10.956
It's no problem.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.126
I always have time for the boss,
and COO, of course.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.171
-Uh, you don't mind if we record this?
-No, not at all.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.886
Cristal and I talked.
We think it's time for Carrington Atlantic

13:23.969 --> 13:26.639
to take full responsibility
for the environmental impact

13:26.722 --> 13:27.932
we've had on Clarke County.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.519
Chemical waste
from our plant has unfortunately

13:31.602 --> 13:33.938
come in contact
with the groundwater supply there.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.439
People are getting sick.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.943
-How long have you two known about this?
-Too long.

13:41.862 --> 13:45.449
When I first started working
at Carrington Atlantic in 2013,

13:45.533 --> 13:48.452
I killed a story
about the Clarke County health crisis.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.705
Even though you knew CA was responsible
for making people sick?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.707
I was just trying to do my job.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.253
-Of course.
-The point is we're gonna make it right.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.713
Come on. It's not like we're big tobacco.

13:59.797 --> 14:03.217
Hmm. Right. People choose to smoke.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.764
-Whatever it takes, we're gonna fix this.
-Yes, we are.

14:11.183 --> 14:14.979
Something is off about him.
Do you know anything about his past?

14:15.521 --> 14:19.191
Did you know he could cook an egg,
let alone a six-course meal?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.902
So, he surprised me
with an unexpected skill.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.697
-Could be worse.
-That's what I'm afraid of.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.868
Liam could be the one, but I haven't seen

14:28.951 --> 14:31.245
that sparkle in your eye
when you talk about him.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.081
How would you know
what I look like when I'm in love?

14:34.790 --> 14:37.334
When I told you Culhane's father was ill,

14:37.418 --> 14:38.919
I thought I saw it.

14:39.003 --> 14:42.381
And for a moment, you seemed warm.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.427
Very unlike you.
And here we are racing to see Culhane.

14:46.510 --> 14:51.140
You're transparent as a hooker's negligee.
You try to get rid of Sam, now Liam.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.142
I don't need advice
from a woman who thinks

14:53.225 --> 14:55.769
"as long as we both shall live"
means "until happy hour."

14:55.853 --> 14:57.855
Fine. I'm done. But in my defense,

14:57.938 --> 15:00.441
my mother didn't give a rat's ass
who I wanted to marry.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.818
All she cared about were dollar signs.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.156
You almost married someone else?

15:10.117 --> 15:13.203
-No wonder you hated being married to Dad.
-I didn't.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.040
He gave me you.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.755
Just stay in the car. -Good talk.
-Uh-huh.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.482
[Sam clears throat]

15:43.442 --> 15:44.985
What the hell do you want?

15:45.861 --> 15:48.948
We're here for the board meeting.
I'm Fallon's proxy.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.241
[bottle clanging]

15:51.867 --> 15:53.243
She sent errand boys?

15:53.327 --> 15:54.954
Senior executive assistant.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.540
And you've met her lawyer,
Mr. Hirshey, and his associates.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.876
Mr. Colby,
is there a board meeting tonight?

16:01.794 --> 16:02.753
I canceled it.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.089
Must've forgot to call the bitch.

16:06.674 --> 16:11.845
Ms. Carrington has a proposal for you,
board meeting or not.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.306
She's offering to sell you back

16:15.015 --> 16:16.392
her portion of Colbyco.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.686
The portion she stole.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.777
That's nice. I have a counteroffer.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.029
One dollar.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.991
That's a hard no?

16:33.951 --> 16:37.496
Fallon Carrington didn't just steal
25 percent of my company.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.541
She stole my family, my pride. I'm not letting her play me ever again.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.005
My offer stands at $1.

16:46.547 --> 16:50.134
-That's what you want me to tell Fallon?
-That's what I want you to tell Fallon.

16:50.217 --> 16:54.221
And if she wants to discuss it further,
she can meet me tomorrow night for drinks.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.807
Yeah,
I don't think drinks are a good idea.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.142
Why not?

16:59.435 --> 17:00.936
I'll be thirsty. [belches]

17:12.656 --> 17:13.531
[Alexis] Michael.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.453
It's Alexis. Carrington?

17:18.746 --> 17:19.747
Fallon's mother.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.460
Could we talk?

17:27.087 --> 17:27.921
Fallon.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.882
Mrs. Culhane, hi.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.177
-How are you?
-We're getting through it.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.596
Thanks to your family, in no small way.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.515
-My family?
-Your father and Cristal.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.269
Oh, I just found out.
I would've been here sooner.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.147
-Michael wanted to keep it private.
-Is he here?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.983
Now isn't a good time, dear.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.444
I wanna let him know I'm here for him.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.822
That's what you want,
but not what Michael needs.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.910
He needs to spend these last moments
with his father.

17:57.993 --> 18:02.581
-And I'm not here to disturb any of that.
-You won't mean to, but you will.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.960
I see how hurt you are
that you weren't the first to know.

18:08.003 --> 18:11.381
But it isn't about you right now.
It's about our family.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.303
I hope you know how much
I care about your son.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.598
And I know how much he cares about you.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.143
And that's why I need you
to let go of him.

18:24.019 --> 18:24.978
Go.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.772
Be with your husband.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.286
-I'm so sorry about your father.
-Why are you here?

18:41.370 --> 18:44.414
Fallon found out about your dad.
Not sure how.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.000
But she's been trying
to reach you all day.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.169
-And when she couldn't--
-Is Fallon upstairs? Yeah. You just missed her.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.299
Maybe that's for the best.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.553
Fallon loves you.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.808
I mean, I believe that she does.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.519
Last I checked,
Fallon was married to Liam.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.312
She doesn't love him.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.773
She loves you.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.442

19:25.831 --> 19:27.374

19:41.221 --> 19:42.055
Let's go home.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.358
So, dish, did the dress slay?

19:53.442 --> 19:55.527
I torpedoed the whole night...

19:55.986 --> 19:59.323
by rushing off to see Culhane,
because I found out his dad is dying.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.241
That's awful.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.119
But you can't blame yourself
for caring about an ex.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.121
Why not? I'm sure Liam does.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.209
If you're into Liam,
and we know you are, ask him out again.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.461
Every couple deserves a second first date.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.340
[sighs] How did the meeting with Jeff go?

20:17.424 --> 20:20.761
It didn't. He canceled it,
and forgot to let you know.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.597
-Um, "forgot"?
-Jeff's a Dumpster fire.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.351
-He's partying way too hard.
-Well, what did he say about my offer?

20:27.434 --> 20:31.188
He, uh, first ripped it up,
and then he said he'd pay you a dollar.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.940
-It was honestly kind of sad.
-[scoffs]

20:33.357 --> 20:36.318
Of course.
You never heard of faking a death spiral

20:36.401 --> 20:40.364
-to lower the takeover value of a company?
-Sounds like a 1 percent problem.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.367
Jeff didn't forget to tell me
that he canceled.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.827
He wants us to think he's leaving Vegas,

20:45.911 --> 20:49.498
so I lower my price,
and you fell for it. Hook, line, sinker.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.876
Hmm. I don't know. You never trust anyone.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.920
Why do people keep saying that?

20:55.003 --> 20:56.630
I am right about Jeff.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.257
And I am right about Liam.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.811
You know,
this leftover ravioli isn't half bad.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.230
That your way of saying sorry?

21:16.066 --> 21:16.900
It's fine.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.111
Anders ended up dining with me.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.405
He's no Fallon,
but he's a good conversationalist

21:21.488 --> 21:24.116
-and excellent spooner.
-You're telling me.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.537
Look. Last night,
I was holding onto the past.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.999
And if you twist my arm,
I might even say that this--

21:32.082 --> 21:33.208
Whatever this is.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.668
--might have potential.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.378
Maybe.

21:37.212 --> 21:40.674
So, what do you think?
Second attempt at a first date?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.051
Give a girl a do-over?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.807
-Okay.
-We'll go to the La Perla party.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.227
Fallon... [chuckles]

21:52.978 --> 21:55.981
I don't even know what La Perla is.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.774
I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.402
Get suited and booted.
We leave in an hour.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.451
Jim, I'm glad you're here.

22:07.534 --> 22:11.246
I wanted to run the language
of our big announcement by you two.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.915
Unfortunately, it might be premature
for an announcement.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.667
And why's that?

22:15.751 --> 22:18.003
Before we announce,
I'm recommending CA

22:18.086 --> 22:20.589
undertake an environmental study
of Clarke County.

22:20.672 --> 22:24.259
To determine exactly
which chemicals are making people sick.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.763
-And how long they've been present.
-How long will it take?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.931
Study like that? Couple years minimum.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.684
Thousands of soil samples,
historical data.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.353
We don't have years.
This is too important.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.565
I understand, but it's irresponsible
to our shareholders

22:38.648 --> 22:42.277
and the people affected to go public
with a major announcement

22:42.360 --> 22:44.946
when we don't know
what's making people sick.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.283
As much as I hate to say it,
Jim has a point.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.744
We need the facts.

22:50.827 --> 22:53.622
The longer we wait, the more people die.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.168
-We need to do the right thing.
-And we will.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.630
As soon as the study is concluded. Until then... we wait.

23:05.008 --> 23:08.804
No. Blake, yesterday,
you admitted to me and Jim on the record--

23:08.887 --> 23:12.390
Unfortunately, Cristal,
you admitted it, too, on the record.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.101
You're both on the hook.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.481
You were never gonna go public, were you?

23:20.482 --> 23:23.902
You just wanted me on the record with you,
to blackmail me into silence.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.403
Now you're being paranoid.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.780
Go to hell.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.332
-What are you doing here?
-A word of advice.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.917
Leave business to Blake.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.587
-Get the hell out of my house.
-Blake's house.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.924
I was just leaving.
I have a trunk show to attend.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.972
[cell phone buzzing]

23:54.015 --> 23:54.850
How's D.C.?

23:54.933 --> 23:57.686
[grunts] Looks an awful lot like El Paso.

23:58.562 --> 23:59.771
I talked to that PI.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.399
He thought Adam might be in El Paso

24:02.482 --> 24:05.318
because he tracked
one of the suspected kidnappers here.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.820
A guy named John Miller.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.364
-Well, did you find him?
-<i>Not exactly.</i>

24:09.447 --> 24:13.243
John Miller is a common name.
I found about 200 listings here.

24:13.326 --> 24:16.788
But I eliminated anyone too young,
too old, or didn't fit the profile.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.415
I got it down to about 25.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.375
I don't know. It's too risky.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.501
<i>I'll be careful.</i>

24:21.585 --> 24:23.795
I don't want you to be disappointed.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.798
I ran out of money,
but I also ran out of hope.

24:27.340 --> 24:30.635
Know how many people took advantage of me?
A grieving mother?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.305
Don't worry. That's why I'm here.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.682
Thank you, Steven.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.436
I'm sure if anyone can find your brother,
it's you.

39:30.034 --> 39:34.955
Liam Ridley's real name is Jack Lowden.
He is a journalist who got a huge advance

39:35.039 --> 39:39.043
-to write a book about the Carringtons.
-He <i>Roman Holiday'd</i> you?

39:39.877 --> 39:41.379
I hate to say it, but--

39:41.462 --> 39:44.006
Yeah, I know. My mom was right.

39:44.548 --> 39:45.966
And I really liked Liam.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.552
Or... Jack.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.554
He had really nice hands.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.891
You know, my mother never taught me
how to tie my shoes

39:53.974 --> 39:55.684
or use a tampon.

39:55.768 --> 39:59.271
She never taught me how to like a boy
in a normal fashion...

39:59.355 --> 40:02.608
or maintain a relationship
to save my life, but...

40:03.692 --> 40:06.404
I thought the upside
of not being raised by her

40:06.487 --> 40:09.824
-is that I wouldn't become her.
-You're not.

40:11.534 --> 40:15.246
We don't see our mothers in the mirror
until we're middle-aged.

40:15.788 --> 40:16.914
But I already do.
