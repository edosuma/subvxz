WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:03.827
Car names are so stupid,
aren't they?

00:05.405 --> 00:06.929
No baron has ever owned
a LeBaron.

00:07.107 --> 00:09.200
Or the Ford LTD.

00:09.376 --> 00:12.641
LTD. Limited.
It's a limited edition.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.474
What did they make,
50 million of those?

00:15.648 --> 00:19.084
Yes, it's limited
to the number we can sell.

00:19.719 --> 00:23.280
Or when they try and mangle
a positive word into a car name.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.391
You know how they'll do that?
The lntegra.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.995
Oh, integrity? No, lntegra.

00:30.163 --> 00:33.599
The Supra or the lmpreza. Yeah?

00:33.767 --> 00:36.065
Well, I hope it's not a "lemona."

00:36.636 --> 00:40.003
Or you'll be hearing
from my "lawya."

00:44.077 --> 00:47.137
So, George, you sure I can't show you
any other cars?

00:48.148 --> 00:49.706
I don't think so, Vic.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.111
Done my homework.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.946
'89 Volvo. That's the car for me.
It's the one I want.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.883
I got a LeBaron convertible
right here.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.557
N.I., not interested.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.559
Got a few more miles on it, but
the previous owner was Jon Voight.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.455
Jon Voight?

01:09.836 --> 01:11.235
Okay, Tim, you're welcome.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.973
-Was that Tim Whatley?
-Yes, it was.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.369
He wanted your address.

01:16.543 --> 01:20.104
You, my friend, are gonna be invited to
his night-before-Thanksgiving party.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.107
He's got that great apartment
on 77th Street...

01:23.283 --> 01:26.252
...and they overlook where they inflate
all those huge balloons...

01:26.419 --> 01:28.250
...for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade.

01:28.421 --> 01:33.290
I have always had a big crush on Tim.
Why can't he ask me out?

01:33.460 --> 01:35.951
He's a dentist. You don't wanna go out
with a dentist.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.721
-Why?
-He'll always be criticizing...

01:37.897 --> 01:40.764
...your brushing technique.
It'll drive you crazy.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.266
Away from the gums.

01:45.004 --> 01:46.835
New car!

01:47.140 --> 01:48.698
Hey!

01:48.875 --> 01:50.342
Did you get the Volvo?

01:50.510 --> 01:54.139
No, I decided to go
with an '89 LeBaron.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.682
A LeBaron?

01:57.851 --> 02:00.285
I thought <i>Consumer</i>
said Volvo was the car.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.887
What consumer? I'm the consumer.

02:04.357 --> 02:06.382
Seems like a strange choice.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.419
Well, maybe so.

02:08.595 --> 02:13.032
But it was good enough
for Mr. Jon Voight.

02:13.766 --> 02:17.532
-Jon Voight? The actor?
-That's right.

02:17.704 --> 02:22.334
He just happened to be
the previous owner of the vehicle.

02:22.509 --> 02:26.468
You bought a car because
it belonged to Jon Voight?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.170
No. No.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.373
I think "yes, yes."

02:30.550 --> 02:34.316
You like the idea of telling people
you're driving Jon Voight's car.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.478
All right, maybe I do. So what?

02:36.923 --> 02:41.189
I've never even seen him in a car.
I mean, look at his movies. No cars.

02:41.361 --> 02:44.262
<i>Deliverance</i>, canoe.

02:44.430 --> 02:47.228
<i>Midnight Cowboy</i>, boots.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.867
<i>Runaway Train...</i>

02:49.035 --> 02:50.263
...runaway train.

02:51.337 --> 02:55.433
Hey. Jerry, you know that shoe
repair place at the end of the block?

02:55.608 --> 02:58.304
If they don't get business,
they'll shut down and make way...

02:58.478 --> 03:02.175
...for one of those gourmet coffee
or cookie stores.

03:02.715 --> 03:06.116
-I like coffee.
-I like cookies.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.151
Well, of course you do.
And you know why?

03:08.321 --> 03:10.619
Because you're a bunch of yuppies.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.816
It's your "go, go"
corporate-takeover lifestyles...

03:13.993 --> 03:16.393
...that are driving out
these mom-and-pop stores...

03:16.563 --> 03:18.861
...and destroying the fabric
of this neighborhood.

03:19.299 --> 03:21.460
Well, what's so great about
a mom-and-pop store?

03:21.634 --> 03:25.627
If my mom and pop ran a store,
I wouldn't shop there.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.600
Hey, Bucambo...

03:27.774 --> 03:30.265
...they've been in the neighborhood
for 48 years.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.434
Now, come on, Jerry,
you gotta have shoes...

03:32.612 --> 03:34.102
...in need of a cobbler.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.579
I really don't wear the kind of shoes
that have to be cobbled.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.012
Well, what about sneakers?

03:39.185 --> 03:41.278
They'll clean them.
They do complete detailing.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.583
-All right. Take them.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.892
Kramer, without you,
we'd be out of business.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.327
These belong to my neighbor,
Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.

03:52.498 --> 03:56.229
-So many sneakers.
-Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.097
They'll be ready
a week from Thursday.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.829
Oh, well, no rush.

04:01.541 --> 04:04.271
-What's the matter?
-I keep getting these nosebleeds.

04:04.444 --> 04:07.174
-Lie down. And put your head back.
-Oh, yeah.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.985
-Hey, what's with your ceiling?
-What?

04:16.154 --> 04:19.180
You got wires sticking out
every which way.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.850
It looks dangerous.
You should call an electrician.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.886
You know, in the 48 years
we've been here...

04:25.064 --> 04:27.294
...I don't think we've ever called
an electrician.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.630
Well, you should.
This place could blow any minute.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.483 --> 04:45.383
-Elaine.
-Yes, Mr. Pitt?

04:45.551 --> 04:48.987
Have you gotten all the salt
off those pretzels yet?

04:49.155 --> 04:50.782
No. I'm still working on it.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.618
What in blazes
are you listening to?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.987
Artie Shaw, "Honeysuckle Jump."

04:55.161 --> 04:57.152
<i>That was Artie Shaw,
"Honeysuckle Jump."</i>

04:57.330 --> 04:59.730
Elaine, how did you know that?

04:59.899 --> 05:04.632
My father used to have
a huge collection of big-band records.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.102
<i>Congratulations to Wayne Hopper
for identifying it.</i>

05:07.273 --> 05:09.264
<i>By doing so,
he becomes our seventh person...</i>

05:09.442 --> 05:11.239
<i>...to man
the Woody Woodpecker balloon...</i>

05:11.411 --> 05:13.572
<i>...in the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.</i>

05:13.746 --> 05:15.737
<i>There are only three spots left.</i>

05:15.915 --> 05:18.406
<i>When we come back,
you'll have three more chances...</i>

05:18.584 --> 05:21.314
<i>...to win a spot holding a rope
under Woody Woodpecker.</i>

05:21.487 --> 05:24.354
Could you identify the next song?
Could you? Could you?

05:24.524 --> 05:28.324
Why would you wanna hold the ropes
from the Woody Woodpecker balloon?

05:28.494 --> 05:30.359
My father was a stern man.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.657
He forbade us to participate
in any activities...

05:32.832 --> 05:35.392
...that he thought were associated
with the common man.

05:35.568 --> 05:38.401
The Thanksgiving Day Parade
was first on the list.

05:38.571 --> 05:41.506
All right. Okay.
I'll do the best I can.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.165
<i>Here we go for the next spot
under the balloon.</i>

05:44.344 --> 05:47.575
<i>If you know the name
of this next song, call 555-BAND.</i>

05:52.785 --> 05:54.844
Well, Elaine? Do you know it?
What song is it?

05:55.021 --> 05:58.354
-Will you shut up? I can't hear!
-I'm sorry.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.821
Oh, I've got it!

06:00.993 --> 06:02.358
It's "Next Stop, Pottersville."

06:02.528 --> 06:04.291
Goody! Yes, yes!

06:04.464 --> 06:07.865
"Next Stop, Pottersville."
You are a genius.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.170
You'll love this car,
even if you don't like Jon Voight.

06:12.338 --> 06:15.307
I like Jon Voight. Just seems like
a strange reason to buy a car...

06:15.475 --> 06:17.033
...because he might have driven it.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.609
What do you mean, "might"?

06:18.778 --> 06:21.645
-You don't think he really owned it?
-I don't know.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.873
Why would the guy make up
something like that?

06:24.050 --> 06:26.780
Of all the names he could pick,
why settle on Jon Voight?

06:26.953 --> 06:28.716
Don't you see,
that's the genius of it.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.483
If he had said Liam Neeson,
you'd know he's making it up.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.216
Liam Neeson?

06:35.027 --> 06:38.292
How are you comparing
Liam Neeson with Jon Voight?

06:38.464 --> 06:40.295
Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.166
If you can play Joe Buck,
Oskar Schindler's a cakewalk.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.272
Oh, look at this.
I stepped in gum.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.908
You're not getting in my car
with gummy shoes.

06:51.010 --> 06:53.774
All right. I'll change my shoes.

06:54.647 --> 06:55.875
Liam Neeson.

06:56.048 --> 06:57.777
You know he's not American.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.042
Let me get a clean pair.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.655
<i>Everybody's talking at me</i>

07:06.559 --> 07:09.289
<i>I can't hear a word they're saying</i>

07:10.797 --> 07:13.595
<i>Just driving round
In Jon Voight's car</i>

07:15.268 --> 07:17.327
Kramer!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.299
Hey, where's all my sneakers?

07:23.476 --> 07:26.343
-You said take them.
-Not all of them.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.980
Well, obviously,
there was a miscommunication.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.947
Obviously. So, what am l
supposed to wear?

07:32.118 --> 07:34.109
-Jerry, I left you a pair right here.
-Where?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.845
Come on. You're not looking.

07:36.022 --> 07:38.320
Here. There. Put on those boots.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.788
I can't wear these.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.957
-Well, why not?
-They're uncomfortable.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.859
Come on here. Try them on.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.698
Where did you get those?

07:48.868 --> 07:51.894
I worked a club in Dallas one time,
and they couldn't pay me...

07:52.071 --> 07:53.299
...so they gave me these.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.735
I can't wear these.
They look ridiculous.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.339
You look like a cowboy.

08:04.283 --> 08:07.184
I don't wanna be a cowboy.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.150
Oh, stop it.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.914
You know Tim the dentist?

08:11.090 --> 08:13.422
I got an invitation to his
Thanksgiving eve party.

08:13.593 --> 08:17.188
-Yeah? I got one too.
-Oh, yeah?

08:18.130 --> 08:20.223
-What?
-No. Nothing.

08:20.399 --> 08:24.392
-No, what is it?
-No, it's just that I didn't get one.

08:24.570 --> 08:25.935
You didn't get one?

08:26.305 --> 08:29.206
But he called me up and asked
for yours and Elaine's addresses.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.865
I'm sure that means I'm invited.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.443
Not necessarily.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.774
Why would you call someone
for addresses...

08:35.948 --> 08:37.745
...if you're not invited to the party?

08:37.917 --> 08:40.477
That's the genius of it.

08:43.623 --> 08:47.753
I'm calling Elaine. See if she can
find out anything from Tim Whatley.

08:47.927 --> 08:51.192
Hey, I got Jon Voight's LeBaron.

08:52.131 --> 08:53.564
Boss.

08:56.869 --> 09:00.305
Four thousand dollars!
We can't afford that.

09:00.473 --> 09:02.373
Well, you have to do
something about it...

09:02.542 --> 09:04.874
...because it's in violation
of the building code.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.202
Otherwise, they're gonna
close you up.

09:07.847 --> 09:11.283
Supposing we can't pay for it?

09:11.450 --> 09:13.213
Then I have to report you.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.513
Otherwise, I lose my license.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.781
Sorry.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.119
Forty-eight years, Mom.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.523
And now we have to close.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.893
All because of that idiot
and his bloody nose.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.330
Afternoon, Mom. Afternoon, Pop.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.299
You know you got a crack
in the sidewalk?

09:31.470 --> 09:32.767
You ought to get that fixed.

09:38.844 --> 09:41.074
-So?
-Come on, put the top up.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.774
-It's November.
-I feel alive, Jerry.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.612
Let's check out the glove box.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.310
Pencil.

09:48.487 --> 09:51.081
Hey, you don't think...?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.986
Sure. That's Jon Voight's pencil.

09:53.859 --> 09:55.190
With Jon Voight's teeth marks.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.692
Owner's manual.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.096
You know what?
This car was owned by Jon Voight.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.600
You see? I told you.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.305
Except Jon is spelled with an "H."

10:08.474 --> 10:11.272
-J-O-H-N.
-So?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.777
Doesn't Jon Voight
spell his name J-O-N?

10:21.687 --> 10:23.655
-So, what are you saying?
-Nothing.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.485
I'm sure Jon probably misspelled
his own name.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.526
I know sometimes I spell Jerry
with a G.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.219
And an l.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.869
-Get out of the car!
-What?

10:42.041 --> 10:45.340
That's right, you heard me. Get out.
You're ruining this whole experience.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.605
Oh, look. There's
Gregory Peck's bicycle.

10:48.781 --> 10:51.545
-Get out!
-And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.514
Get out!

10:58.057 --> 10:59.490
Hey, cowboy.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.092
Where's your horse?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.964
Yeah, you better run.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.363
-Did they take anything?
-They didn't touch me.

11:13.539 --> 11:16.007
I tripped because of
these stupid cowboy boots.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.537
Well, anyway, again, I'm sorry
about throwing you out of the car.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.272
-You really seemed to enjoy it.
-It was kind of fun.

11:23.649 --> 11:28.143
You know, maybe his name
really is J-O-H-N...

11:28.320 --> 11:30.948
...but he changed it to J-O-N
for show business.

11:31.323 --> 11:34.417
Well, you know, J-O-N
is a lot zippier.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.190
Yeah, that's possible.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.025
How would you find out
something like that?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.863
Wait a minute. What am I thinking?

11:43.035 --> 11:45.970
I've got the entire Yankee organization
at my disposal.

11:47.106 --> 11:50.303
-He'll dispose of it.
-That's right. See you later.

11:52.111 --> 11:55.911
So, Jerome, I did a little
snooping around for you.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.640
What'd you find out, Lois?

11:57.817 --> 12:02.481
Well, I talked to Tim Whatley.

12:03.422 --> 12:04.650
Yeah?

12:04.824 --> 12:07.725
And I asked him,
"Should Jerry bring anything?"

12:07.893 --> 12:09.827
Subtle.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.828
And he said,
"Why would Jerry bring anything?"

12:12.998 --> 12:14.727
All right, but let me ask you this.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.333
Which word did he emphasize?

12:16.502 --> 12:19.596
Did he say,
"Why would Jerry bring anything?"

12:19.772 --> 12:22.969
Or, "Why would Jerry
bring anything?"

12:23.142 --> 12:26.077
Did he emphasize
"Jerry" or "bring"?

12:26.879 --> 12:29.347
I think he emphasized "would."

12:31.283 --> 12:32.841
Know what? The hell with this party.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.542
I don't wanna go to begin with.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.488
-Hey.
-Hey. So where's my sneakers?

12:37.656 --> 12:39.749
-That's what I wanna know.
-What do you mean?

12:39.925 --> 12:41.722
Well, I saw Mom and Pop
this morning...

12:41.894 --> 12:45.091
...but when I went by the store on
my way home, the place was empty.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.630
Everything is gone.
Mom and Pop...

12:48.267 --> 12:50.098
...vanished.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.965
-So all my sneakers are gone?
-I'm afraid so.

12:53.139 --> 12:54.834
And that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

12:55.007 --> 12:58.101
I've been asking around.
They didn't even have any kids.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.538
Mom and Pop aren't even
a mom and pop?

13:02.715 --> 13:03.943
It was all an act, Jerry.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.983
They conned us,
and they scored bigtime.

13:07.486 --> 13:12.389
So Mom and Pop's plan was
to move into the neighborhood...

13:12.558 --> 13:15.322
...establish trust...

13:15.494 --> 13:18.088
...for 48 years...

13:19.165 --> 13:22.999
...and then run off
with Jerry's sneakers?

13:23.369 --> 13:24.927
Apparently.

13:26.372 --> 13:28.363
All right. That's enough of this.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.169
-Where you going?
-I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli...

13:31.343 --> 13:34.369
...to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass
for the parade.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.277
Why does he wanna hold a rope
underneath Woody Woodpecker...

13:37.449 --> 13:39.178
...in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?

13:39.351 --> 13:42.912
He finds his laugh intoxicating.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.016
So, George, what kind
of promotional events...

13:47.193 --> 13:48.854
-...are we talking about?
-Well...

13:49.028 --> 13:52.725
...I think we need more
special days at the stadium.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.126
You know, like...

13:54.300 --> 13:56.825
...Joe Pepitone Day...

13:57.870 --> 14:00.737
-...or Jon Voight Day.
-Jon Voight?

14:00.906 --> 14:02.669
The actor?

14:04.043 --> 14:07.206
I make a motion that we have
no more of these meetings...

14:07.379 --> 14:10.746
...that have been initiated
by George Costanza.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.681
I suppose if I had suggested
Liam Neeson Day...

14:13.853 --> 14:15.684
...you'd all be patting me
on the back.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.817
I guessed Stan Herman's
"Boomtown Blues."

14:21.026 --> 14:26.362
-What did you guess?
-It was "Next Stop, Pottersville."

14:26.532 --> 14:28.432
Everybody knows that.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.095
You know when they're giving out
the passes?

14:31.403 --> 14:32.631
After the music.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.318
Oh, man.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.416
Taxi! Taxi.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.420
Hey! Jon Voight!

14:58.597 --> 15:01.122
Jon Voight! Hey, listen.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.664
Can I ask you something?
Listen. Do you--? Wait--

15:14.446 --> 15:17.210
-No Jon Voight Day, huh?
-No.

15:17.383 --> 15:20.511
Now I'll always have this doubt
about the car.

15:20.686 --> 15:23.280
-What, your jaw still hurts?
-Yeah, it's all swollen.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.685
I think I chipped a tooth
when I fell yesterday.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.783
-Have somebody look at it.
-I'm calling dentists all day.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.929
Nobody working
the day before Thanksgiving.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.929
-You going to the party?
-No. I don't know if I'm invited.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.267
-There'll be lots of dentists there.
-Yeah, you're right.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.131
You don't wanna suffer all weekend.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.865
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist.
This is killing me.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.033
Well, I'll take a chance.
We'll go together.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.370
Maybe I'll just meet you there.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.448
-You don't wanna go with me?
-Jerry...

15:51.617 --> 15:54.552
...for all I know, this guy went
out of his way to not invite you.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.654
How am I gonna feel if I show up...

15:56.822 --> 15:58.847
...with an uninvited,
unwelcome intruder?

15:59.491 --> 16:02.460
The way I feel
when I go places with you?

16:04.897 --> 16:07.388
-Hey.
-Hey. Did you find my sneakers yet?

16:07.566 --> 16:10.000
No. But I ran into somebody
you might be interested in.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.399
A Mr. Jon Voight, the actor.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.399
Jon Voight, are you kidding me?!
Did you talk to him?

16:15.574 --> 16:17.064
He was a little standoffish.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.006
What, you didn't ask him
about the car?

16:21.180 --> 16:25.082
I couldn't. His cab pulled away.
But he did make an impression on me.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.717
-Look.
-What?

16:26.885 --> 16:29.217
His tooth marks. He bit me.

16:29.388 --> 16:32.323
-Jon Voight bit you?
-What is he, a vampire?

16:32.491 --> 16:35.483
No, it's justifiable.
He thought I was going for his wallet.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.027
-He left perfect imprints.
-That he did.

16:38.197 --> 16:41.223
You've got that pencil
with the bite marks on it?

16:41.400 --> 16:45.336
We get a trained eye to match them,
and we'll see if you're driving his car.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.904
Oh, please.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.098
Wait a minute.
Wait, it's not that stupid.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.607
No, it's stupid.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.440
Why? Why is it impossible?
I mean, they're both bite marks.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.310
So you're showing up at that party
with a chewed-up pencil...

16:58.484 --> 16:59.849
...and Kramer's gnarled arm?

17:01.420 --> 17:03.581
-It's worth a shot.
-Yeah.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.690
Kramer, you wanna go
to the party together?

17:05.858 --> 17:08.122
Jerry, look, come on,
I'm an invited guest.

17:08.292 --> 17:11.558
I can't be aiding and abetting
some party crasher.

17:25.511 --> 17:29.311
Excuse me, dentist? Dentist?

17:32.317 --> 17:34.012
Dentist?

17:34.186 --> 17:36.654
Are you a dentist?

17:36.822 --> 17:38.619
Are you a dentist?

17:39.591 --> 17:41.422
These are the balloons?

17:41.593 --> 17:43.561
Big deal. All I see
is Woody Woodpecker.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.459
You got a problem
with Woody Woodpecker?

17:47.633 --> 17:50.363
Yeah. What is he,
some sort of an instigator?

17:50.536 --> 17:53.369
That's right. He's a troublemaker.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.331
Hey, did you get my message?

17:57.676 --> 17:59.871
What? I can't hear
a word you're saying.

18:00.045 --> 18:05.108
I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli
all day. My head is still ringing.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.683
Where's Tim?

18:06.852 --> 18:08.581
What's that,
the Empire State Building?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.745
What? I can't hear you!

18:12.958 --> 18:14.448
Elaine, would you marry me?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.089
Wh--? I told you,
I can't hear a word.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.231
All right. Forget it.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.533
-Hey, Tim, how you doing?
-George. Kramer, how you doing?

18:24.703 --> 18:26.534
Watch-- Watch the arm.

18:26.705 --> 18:29.196
Listen, we don't wanna bother you.
We know you're busy.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.808
-No, it's okay, what is it?
-Let me show you something.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.706
-Take a look.
-I'm gonna get going.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.507
Let me take down your number.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.818
-Hey, is that Jerry Seinfeld?
-Hey, he didn't come with us.

18:40.986 --> 18:43.045
-Tim, the pencil.
-Jerry.

18:43.222 --> 18:46.055
-Hey, Tim.
-Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.

18:46.492 --> 18:50.019
Did you say, "Jerry,
I didn't think you'd show"...

18:50.195 --> 18:52.891
...or "Jerry, I didn't think
you'd show."

18:54.399 --> 18:57.960
-Elaine, hi.
-Tim.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.798
I'm really glad you came.

19:00.572 --> 19:03.837
-What?
-I'm really glad you came.

19:07.379 --> 19:10.837
Listen, Elaine,
I've been wanting to ask you...

19:11.016 --> 19:13.507
...would you like to go out with me
New Year's Eve?

19:18.290 --> 19:19.951
Thanks.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.320
What? What?

19:22.761 --> 19:24.194
Let me ask you something.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.298
Could you tell if teeth marks
on somebody's arm...

19:27.466 --> 19:29.058
...matched teeth marks on a pencil?

19:29.601 --> 19:32.593
-It's possible.
-Roll up your sleeve.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.068
Somebody bit you?

19:34.239 --> 19:36.833
Well, not just someone.
Jon Voight.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.102
-Jon Voight bit you?
-Yeah, yeah.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.540
The pencil.
Get the pencil out of your mouth!

19:43.715 --> 19:46.445
You're destroying
Jon Voight's teeth marks.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.246
-That's Jon Voight's pencil?
-That's right.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.083
And I got his whole car downstairs.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.851
Are you the one you bought
his LeBaron convertible?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.756
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

19:56.929 --> 19:59.056
Yes, I'm the one.

19:59.231 --> 20:03.565
-So you know Jon Voight?
-Yes. I went to dental school with him.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.161
-Jon Voight, the actor?
-No.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.567
The periodontist.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.668
Can't this wait until Monday?
Come by my office.

20:11.843 --> 20:16.007
-Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
-All right. Sit down.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.780
It's this one here in the back.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.922
You popped Woody Woodpecker!

20:29.194 --> 20:31.822
Hey, who invited you anyway?
You're a troublemaker.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.962
<i>Looks like Woody Woodpecker
is running out of air.</i>

20:40.138 --> 20:42.436
<i>In fact, he's collapsing.</i>

20:43.342 --> 20:46.004
Those kids look pretty disappointed.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.772
Especially that big kid
up in the front.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.442
How old is he?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.212
-Hello.
-<i>Hello, is this Jerry Seinfeld?</i>

20:55.387 --> 20:57.184
-Yes, it is.
-You don't know me...

20:57.356 --> 20:59.187
...but a really
strange thing happened.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.417
I was at a garage sale,
and this old couple...

21:01.593 --> 21:02.855
...sold me used sneakers...

21:03.028 --> 21:05.792
...they claimed belonged
to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.023
Could I have the address
to that garage sale?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.966
Okay, thank you very much.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.869
I found Mom and Pop.
They're selling my sneakers.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.870
-Where are they?
-Parsippany, New Jersey.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.372
Let's go.

21:18.844 --> 21:21.972
-My car's in the shop.
-How are we getting to Parsippany?

21:29.821 --> 21:31.413
Jerry...

21:31.590 --> 21:34.184
...these nosebleeds
are starting again.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.418
Maybe we should get you
to a hospital.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.825
I ain't going to no Bellevue.

21:38.997 --> 21:42.592
Look at me,
I'm falling apart here.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.858
The marching band
is a perfect example...

22:09.027 --> 22:12.258
...of taking something bad
and making it difficult too.

22:12.431 --> 22:15.594
I mean, why does the band
have to march? We're not moving.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.463
Maybe if they hold still,
we could all leave.

22:19.237 --> 22:21.364
Is that why they do it?
People try and get away.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.737
"No, you don't. I'm right with you.
Right with you, buddy."

22:25.711 --> 22:31.172
The human urge to wave
at total strangers just moving by...

22:31.350 --> 22:33.181
...is very strong, isn't it?

22:33.352 --> 22:35.183
Parades and ocean liners...

22:35.354 --> 22:38.084
...and those little trains that
go through amusement parks.

22:38.256 --> 22:40.690
It's always that bittersweet,
kind of hello-goodbye...

22:40.859 --> 22:42.656
...combination wave, isn't it? Just:

22:42.828 --> 22:45.490
I've never seen these people
before in my life...

22:45.664 --> 22:47.564
...and they're leaving.
