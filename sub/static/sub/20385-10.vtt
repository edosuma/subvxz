Mr. Varga.

46:23.982 --> 46:25.383
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

46:27.118 --> 46:30.455
You're asking me
if there are phones
in Belgium?

46:34.159 --> 46:35.360
(CHUCKLES)

46:37.528 --> 46:40.065
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen next.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.600
Three agents
from Homeland Security

46:42.633 --> 46:45.170
are gonna put handcuffs on you
and take you to Rikers.

46:45.203 --> 46:47.638
And then we're gonna
charge you with felony
money laundering

46:47.672 --> 46:50.375
and six counts of conspiracy
to commit murder.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.179
And then I'm gonna
go home to my son,
it's his birthday tomorrow.

46:54.212 --> 46:56.347
I promised I'd take him
to the state fair.

46:56.381 --> 46:57.782
You ever guess a pig's weight?

46:57.815 --> 46:59.650
Or eat a deep fried
Snickers bar?

47:01.486 --> 47:05.991
There's no better way
to spend a Saturday in this,
our great American experiment.

47:10.761 --> 47:14.299
So, while you're eating
mashed potatoes
from a box in a dark room,

47:14.332 --> 47:16.834
think of me among
the amber waves of grain.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.343
No.

47:28.613 --> 47:30.848
That's not what's
gonna happen next.

47:31.917 --> 47:34.185
What's gonna
happen next is this.

47:35.620 --> 47:38.789
In five minutes
that door is going to open,

47:39.457 --> 47:42.727
and a man you can't argue with
will tell me

47:42.760 --> 47:44.229
I'm free to go.

47:44.262 --> 47:46.898
And I will stand
from this chair

47:46.932 --> 47:50.601
and disappear into the world,
so help me God.

47:58.944 --> 48:02.080
Rikers and Snickers bars.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.382
You'll see.

48:05.250 --> 48:06.617
(TSKS)

48:07.785 --> 48:09.454
Agent Burgle.

48:12.457 --> 48:13.791
Gloria.

48:16.294 --> 48:17.963
Trust me.

48:19.064 --> 48:21.066
The future is certain.

48:21.799 --> 48:24.702
And when it comes,
you will know
without question,

48:24.735 --> 48:26.837
your place in the world.

48:27.738 --> 48:30.308
Until then, we've said
all there is to say.

48:31.309 --> 48:35.146
Any further debate would be
simply wasting our breath.

48:36.081 --> 48:39.817
And if there's one thing
I can't abide, it's waste.

48:52.330 --> 48:53.631
Goodbye.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.470

49:07.178 --> 49:08.980
