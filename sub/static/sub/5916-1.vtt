03:26.939 --> 03:30.359
Burt. Shut that
bloody thing up.

03:32.486 --> 03:34.530
Do you know what time
it is? Burt!

03:35.155 --> 03:38.033
Burt! You stupid old bastard!

03:38.283 --> 03:40.035
What do you think
you're doing?

03:40.244 --> 03:42.037
Sorry George,
what did you say?

03:42.204 --> 03:43.789
Do you know what time it is?

03:44.081 --> 03:46.542
I'm sorry, I've got a heck
of a lot to get done today.

03:46.792 --> 03:50.838
And you know what they say.
"The early bird catches the worm".

03:50.963 --> 03:54.716
Well, if you do this again,
one more time, I'm calling the cops.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.679
And how about
mowing your lawns?

03:58.679 --> 04:00.806
Its a bloody disgrace
to the neighborhood.

04:06.562 --> 04:07.646
Oh, alright.

04:14.278 --> 04:15.404
Hi, kid.

04:32.379 --> 04:34.047
Here we are, the...

04:35.007 --> 04:36.592
perfect recipe...

04:37.759 --> 04:39.303
two of Chevy...

04:40.512 --> 04:41.763
one of Ford.

04:45.809 --> 04:49.896
I think those '36 Chevy pistons...

04:50.147 --> 04:52.607
must have a touch of titanium
or something in them.

04:52.649 --> 04:54.568
They come up real good,
you know.

04:55.694 --> 04:57.279
Hey the kettle's boiling.

04:57.487 --> 04:59.489
Make yourself useful,
make some tea.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.122
Can we have a biscuit too?

05:07.622 --> 05:10.125
- What?
- Can I have a Gingernut?

05:10.375 --> 05:12.586
Yeah, you know where they are,
help yourself.

05:17.299 --> 05:18.967
Now you stay over there,
stay there.

05:28.768 --> 05:31.438
- Right.
- What are you doing for Christmas, Burt?

05:31.605 --> 05:33.523
Christmas? I don't know.
Why?

05:33.773 --> 05:35.859
Are you angling
for a present or something?

05:35.859 --> 05:38.904
- No, I wondered if you were going away.
- No...

05:39.279 --> 05:42.866
no time for Christmas, lad.
Got a lot of work to do.

05:43.158 --> 05:46.202
I only managed twenty seven
test runs this year.

05:46.328 --> 05:49.331
You know, twenty four on the beach
and three on the road.

05:49.623 --> 05:51.207
All illegal like.

05:53.043 --> 05:55.587
I was going a bit over the speed limit,
I'll have to admit.

05:55.795 --> 05:58.214
- How fast were you going?
- I don't know, I haven't a clue.

05:58.423 --> 06:01.259
Thas why I have to get up
to Bonneville.

06:02.344 --> 06:04.220
Found out how fast she will go.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.654
Now, there you go.

06:22.238 --> 06:24.365
Got to get the piston out
of the mould...

06:25.325 --> 06:26.576
and Bob's your uncle.

06:27.494 --> 06:29.204
Right, this is...

06:29.829 --> 06:32.248
the last part
of the operation now.

06:32.499 --> 06:33.792
To chill the metal.

06:34.250 --> 06:37.045
It heat treats it.
Right, watch yourself.

06:40.507 --> 06:43.092
Thats where I got the water
for the kettle from.

06:43.343 --> 06:48.181
Well, you know, it gives the tea
a nice tang of titanium, doesn't it?

06:48.515 --> 06:50.391
Now this bloke,
he once asked me...

06:50.391 --> 06:54.562
"How do you heat treat your pistons?"
And I said: "I don't, mate"...

06:54.562 --> 06:58.566
I just, you know, bung them
in cold water and Bob's your uncle".

06:58.608 --> 07:01.402
And he said:
"Well, thats the heat treatment"...

07:01.444 --> 07:05.531
and he just laughed and
shook his head and walked away like.

07:05.823 --> 07:08.493
Well, look this could be
the perfect piston.

07:08.493 --> 07:11.245
It blooming well ought to be,
I've made hundreds of them.

07:11.496 --> 07:14.916
Look at them all up there,
all blown to smithereens.

07:16.042 --> 07:19.337
- You made all those?
- Yeah, I did. Look perfect.

07:19.837 --> 07:21.798
Beautiful, no inclusions see?

07:22.215 --> 07:27.512
Now Tommy, does your mother have
a carving knife I could borrow?

07:27.595 --> 07:28.888
Carving knife? Yeah?

07:29.138 --> 07:30.890
Yeah.
I need a good sharp knife.

07:39.357 --> 07:40.650
Hang on.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.694
- Thomas, what are you up to?
- Nothing, Mum.

07:43.903 --> 07:45.113
Can I have some bread
and peanut butter?

07:45.196 --> 07:47.907
Ok, but make sure you put everything
away when you've finished.

07:49.158 --> 07:50.451
Sorry about that.

07:59.502 --> 08:00.503
Tom.

08:01.379 --> 08:04.173
- Don't forget the wood.
- No, Mum.

08:08.970 --> 08:10.054
Right.

08:11.472 --> 08:13.224
I hope to get as much...

08:13.641 --> 08:15.810
rubber off as possible.

08:16.310 --> 08:18.854
It has to be perfectly bald,
like that, you see.

08:19.397 --> 08:22.858
- Why's that?
- Well, at high speed...

08:23.192 --> 08:25.319
the centrifugal force...

08:25.736 --> 08:27.822
expands the tyre and...

08:28.531 --> 08:31.993
it rubs against
the frame of the bike.

08:32.784 --> 08:35.830
Have to be careful not to cut
through the cords though.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.710
- Why do you pee on your lemon tree?
- What?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.379
Why do you pee on your
lemon tree?

08:46.340 --> 08:48.759
- Who says I do that?
- Mum says she sees you...

08:48.843 --> 08:51.220
every morning and
she goes on and on about it.

08:51.512 --> 08:52.722
Does she?

08:54.557 --> 08:58.894
Well, its good for it. You shouldn't
waste anything in this world, sonny.

08:59.937 --> 09:02.231
- Well, I'd better be off home.
- Alright then.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.650
Mum gets a bit cross if
I stay over here too long.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.860
She does.

09:08.028 --> 09:12.408
- Are you finished with the knife?
- Not yet, I'll drop it by later.

09:12.616 --> 09:15.744
No, don't do that,
I'll pick it up after school tomorrow.

09:16.078 --> 09:17.204
Alright.

09:18.539 --> 09:20.457
- Bye.
- Cheerio.

09:29.550 --> 09:31.218
- Burt Munro.
- Yeah.

09:31.218 --> 09:33.554
I believe you have
my carving knife.

09:33.804 --> 09:35.806
- Oh yes.
- And my sharpener.

09:38.058 --> 09:39.768
Hang on, here we are.

09:43.314 --> 09:44.648
Well, thanks a lot, love.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.285
G'day Frank. How are you?

09:56.368 --> 09:59.079
Oh not bad, could be better,
could be worse.

09:59.121 --> 10:02.166
I see your front tyre's going
a bit flat on you there, Burt.

10:02.416 --> 10:05.753
Yeah, well, the good news is,
its only flat on the bottom.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.048
I'll see you tomorrow night
for the fun and games.

10:09.048 --> 10:10.007
Ill be a good one.

10:12.384 --> 10:13.427
Hello, Fran.

10:14.762 --> 10:18.682
- Give us the lot will you? The usual.
- One pension check. Coming up.

10:20.017 --> 10:21.435
Fran...

10:22.019 --> 10:25.564
I want to ask you a question,
the answer to which is...

10:27.149 --> 10:28.358
a definite yes.

10:28.901 --> 10:31.069
- Alright, Fran?
- Alright.

10:31.778 --> 10:32.863
Yes.

10:33.822 --> 10:35.115
What is the question, Burt?

10:35.616 --> 10:38.785
Would you feel inclined to,
you know, accompany...

10:39.703 --> 10:43.582
an impeccable young gentleman
to a local do tomorrow night?

10:45.417 --> 10:47.794
You're asking me on a date,
Burt Munro?

10:48.795 --> 10:51.131
Well, yeah, I suppose
I am actually, aren't I?

10:52.507 --> 10:54.092
- Would you?
- You're on.

11:01.224 --> 11:02.976
- Hello, son.
- Hey, Burt.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.437
Thats disgusting.

11:06.396 --> 11:07.814
It is, isn't it?

11:08.565 --> 11:11.777
All dressed up
for the do tonight...

11:11.860 --> 11:13.653
and I couldn't get
my best shoes on...

11:13.653 --> 11:16.239
because my toe nails had grown
like oyster shells.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.241
Alright...

11:18.658 --> 11:20.160
this should do the trick.

11:21.620 --> 11:22.996
There, look at that.

11:23.205 --> 11:24.539
Little twinkle toes.

11:31.546 --> 11:33.465
- Thanks, Burt.
- Right on.

11:42.933 --> 11:44.768
- Evening, Burt.
- Thank you...

11:45.060 --> 11:47.229
- this is Fran.
- Hello, Fran.

11:47.521 --> 11:48.980
Thank you very much.

11:49.189 --> 11:51.107
- Hello, Duncan.
- Burt.

11:51.858 --> 11:55.820
Just going to say hello and be back
in a second, love, alright?

11:57.030 --> 11:59.157
- How are you?
- Bike going well?

11:59.324 --> 12:00.575
Yeah, not too bad.

12:00.909 --> 12:03.161
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Thanks a lot, mate.

12:03.453 --> 12:05.455
This is a bit of
a surprise, isn't it?

12:06.248 --> 12:08.750
Would you like to buy
a raffle ticket or two?

12:08.750 --> 12:11.711
- Whats it for?
- Porky the Pig plus two dozen beers.

12:11.962 --> 12:15.674
We're raising money to send
Burt to the USA. Our mate, Burt.

12:17.717 --> 12:19.719
Hello. Come on and dance.

12:21.221 --> 12:24.599
- Whats this? The twist?
- This is the twist. You know the twist?

12:25.141 --> 12:26.726
Come twist with me.

12:29.479 --> 12:30.939
See you can twist.

12:34.109 --> 12:36.861
<i>- Thats it, thats it.
- This must be it, the atomic invasion.</i>

12:37.445 --> 12:40.532
Then the air clears
and the dust settles down.

12:40.615 --> 12:43.368
You look outside,
have they leveled the town?

12:43.993 --> 12:46.162
But there, in the yard...

12:46.162 --> 12:48.081
so briskly alive...

12:48.289 --> 12:50.458
stands Burt Munro's trusty...

12:50.834 --> 12:52.919
old Indian Scout '45.

12:58.258 --> 13:00.593
That was a wonderful
tribute to Burt.

13:00.802 --> 13:03.680
Now come on Burt, we want you up
on stage, come on...

13:03.930 --> 13:05.390
come on, up you come.

13:09.060 --> 13:12.397
I hope all of you have bought
a raffle ticket tonight...

13:12.605 --> 13:16.859
because we believe Burt will put
the Southland Motorcycle Club...

13:16.859 --> 13:17.986
<i>on the map.</i>

13:28.663 --> 13:30.248
Whats going on out there?

13:30.832 --> 13:32.250
Get out of here.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.211
Oh, dear.

13:42.885 --> 13:47.140
Well folks, it looks like
I've cracked it, I've um you know.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.058
You Burt Munro?

13:49.767 --> 13:51.477
- What did he say?
- I said, are you Burt Munro?

13:52.186 --> 13:54.272
Are you looking for old Burt?

13:54.522 --> 13:56.566
I don't know,
anyone seen Burt anywhere?

13:56.941 --> 13:58.526
Anyone seen Burt?

13:58.985 --> 14:00.820
- No, he's...
- You are, you're Burt Munro.

14:01.404 --> 14:04.031
You're the old codger,
rides the Army Indian right?

14:04.240 --> 14:06.534
That old joker.
Burt Munro. Yeah.

14:07.201 --> 14:08.786
Yeah, thats me I think.

14:09.745 --> 14:13.708
Now the, ah, young fella,
the army Indian is a real dog...

14:14.000 --> 14:15.960
what I've got is the...

14:16.419 --> 14:20.590
genuine article,
the 1920 V twin Scout.

14:20.840 --> 14:24.177
<i>- Thats the one with the pedals, right?
- Don't put up with that, Burt.</i>

14:25.636 --> 14:30.641
No, well. Well, I don't know what sort of
push bikes you monkeys came into town on...

14:30.725 --> 14:35.521
but I know my old timer would trash
the backsides of whatever they are.

14:36.230 --> 14:38.357
- I don't think so, granddad.
- No.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.487
Well, why don't you chaps
put your money where your mouth is?

14:44.405 --> 14:46.198
You're on. You old coot.

14:49.952 --> 14:52.121
- Looks like they've chickened out, Burt.
- What?

14:52.163 --> 14:54.707
- Looks like they've chickened out.
- They're here.

14:56.292 --> 14:57.376
They're here.

15:01.505 --> 15:03.132
Thats nice of them
to show up isn't it?

15:11.182 --> 15:14.059
A hundred says
the Indian comes last.

15:14.310 --> 15:15.561
Right.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.335
Come on, Burt.

15:41.712 --> 15:42.963
Ready, steady...

15:44.506 --> 15:45.507
go.

15:50.095 --> 15:51.764
Come on, give me a push.

15:53.557 --> 15:55.225
- Come on.
- Come on, Burt.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.978
Give me a push.
Come on, push hard.

16:00.522 --> 16:01.649
Bugger it.

16:04.485 --> 16:05.444
Bugger it.

16:07.154 --> 16:08.530
Come on! Go!

16:52.616 --> 16:53.659
Bugger!

16:53.909 --> 16:55.536
Nice bike, granddad.

16:56.078 --> 16:57.162
Loser.

17:15.513 --> 17:16.765
Thanks, fellas.

17:16.848 --> 17:19.393
- Better luck next time.
- Better luck, Burt.

17:24.731 --> 17:25.773
There you go.

17:26.108 --> 17:27.943
- Well, thanks, love.
- Careful, its hot.

17:30.278 --> 17:33.281
Well, at least I gave them
a good run for their money.

17:33.740 --> 17:35.367
On the downward leg anyway.

17:36.451 --> 17:39.913
Burt... Whats it going to cost
to get over to America?

17:39.996 --> 17:41.415
Sorry, love.
What did you say?

17:41.415 --> 17:43.458
How much is it gonna cost
to get over to America?

17:44.209 --> 17:47.254
I don't know,
about two thousand I'm told.

17:47.796 --> 17:49.840
And how much money
have you got now?

17:51.216 --> 17:55.720
Apart from today's disaster
and the dough from last and you know...

17:55.720 --> 17:58.890
the pension money
I've been saving...

17:59.182 --> 18:04.062
I'm about twelve hundred and 75 dollars,
United States dollars, I reckon.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.815
Well, I could lend you some money.

18:07.023 --> 18:11.945
Thats very kind of you Fran love, but no.
I couldn't do that love. No, thanks.

18:12.112 --> 18:14.322
Well, there must be
something you can do.

18:14.906 --> 18:17.701
Well, I haven't told anyone
else this, Fran, but...

18:17.909 --> 18:22.664
I don't reckon I'll be gonna Bonneville.
I reckon not this year anyway and...

18:23.331 --> 18:27.168
you know, seven hundred dollars
is a lot of money to find...

18:27.419 --> 18:31.631
and the boat leaves in five days.

18:33.717 --> 18:38.263
Except I would like to see
how fast she would really go...

18:38.346 --> 18:43.518
before I fall off the perch as it were.
Before I ah, kicked the old bucket.

18:53.945 --> 18:55.405
Hello, Lloyd.

18:55.864 --> 18:57.115
Gidday, Burt.

18:57.323 --> 18:58.324
Shame about the fall.

18:58.616 --> 19:00.452
Well, I'm still
in one piece aren't I?

19:01.494 --> 19:02.954
Good,
what are you having tonight?

19:02.996 --> 19:05.373
Specialty of the house,
pea, pie and pud.

19:05.582 --> 19:07.167
- Thats five bob.
- Alright.

19:07.542 --> 19:11.004
Burt? Why don't you take out
a mortgage on your house?

19:11.212 --> 19:13.047
- What house?
- Well, your property.

19:13.131 --> 19:15.008
I mean its worth something.

19:17.093 --> 19:18.261
Here you are.

19:18.261 --> 19:20.555
Burt Munro,
look at the color of your hands.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.266
- Whats the matter with them.
- You're gonna wash those mitts...

19:23.266 --> 19:25.059
before you put them
anywhere near me.

19:25.393 --> 19:26.686
There we are.

20:00.428 --> 20:01.596
Wakee, wakee.

20:02.388 --> 20:03.848
Time to rise...

20:04.807 --> 20:06.309
and shine.

20:07.852 --> 20:09.771
Burt, you're a sweetie.

20:10.563 --> 20:13.399
Got to get out of here before
the neighbors spot me.

20:18.988 --> 20:21.616
Burt, this tastes a bit odd.

20:22.867 --> 20:23.826
Its metallic.

20:25.244 --> 20:29.081
<i>You are my sunshine
My only sunshine</i>

20:29.290 --> 20:30.374
Oh, crikey!

20:30.833 --> 20:32.084
What?

20:32.335 --> 20:33.753
I've got a pain in my chest.

20:35.296 --> 20:37.089
He's in the shed, hurry.

20:41.594 --> 20:44.013
Mum, Dad,
something's happened to Burt.

20:51.729 --> 20:53.397
Burt, whats wrong with you?

20:53.564 --> 20:55.816
I'll be alright Tommy,
don't worry about me.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.235
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

21:19.965 --> 21:23.511
What are you all staring at?
Dirty old men need love too.

21:27.973 --> 21:29.600
- Mr. Munro.
- Hello.

21:29.892 --> 21:32.353
So, whats the story, Doc?

21:32.686 --> 21:36.732
- I'm sorry, its not good news.
- Oh, yeah. Well, fire away.

21:38.317 --> 21:40.111
You've had an attack of angina.

21:41.362 --> 21:43.113
You have arterial sclerosis.

21:43.948 --> 21:45.282
And whats that?

21:45.533 --> 21:48.118
Its a narrowing
of the arteries from the heart.

21:48.369 --> 21:49.370
Oh, dear.

21:49.620 --> 21:51.872
Yeah, I'm afraid there's not too much
we can do for you at your age...

21:51.956 --> 21:54.083
other than suggesting you
take it easy.

21:55.209 --> 21:58.420
Look if you have another attack,
pop one of these under your tongue...

21:58.671 --> 22:00.839
let it dissolve
and then swallow the saliva.

22:00.923 --> 22:03.425
The pain should be gone
in thirty seconds.

22:03.676 --> 22:06.387
- Yeah, what do you call these things?
- Trinitrate pills.

22:07.179 --> 22:09.181
Um better known as nitro glycerine.

22:09.473 --> 22:12.810
- The stuff you blow things up with.
- Yes, but in much smaller quantities.

22:12.893 --> 22:13.894
Alright.

22:15.354 --> 22:18.816
Will this have any affect on
me riding my bike?

22:20.734 --> 22:24.279
Unfortunately, I think your
motorcycling days are over.

22:24.571 --> 22:25.572
Like hell they are.

22:40.254 --> 22:41.588
It won't be much longer.

22:50.013 --> 22:51.390
Springfield.

22:52.558 --> 22:56.395
Springfield.
Thats where the Indians come from.

22:56.478 --> 22:59.064
- Indians?
- Yeah, the Indians...

22:59.898 --> 23:01.525
from Springfield,
Massachusetts.

23:02.734 --> 23:04.486
The worlďs greatest
motorcycle.

23:05.404 --> 23:07.114
- Is that so?
- Thats right.

23:08.532 --> 23:10.951
- You can come through now.
- Alright, thank you.

23:11.869 --> 23:13.662
Yeah, Springfield.

23:15.747 --> 23:18.917
<i>The plan is for me
to drive up to Timaru and...</i>

23:19.251 --> 23:24.172
then me and my bike...
will catch a boat to the US of A to...

23:24.256 --> 23:27.634
Los Angeles,
and the boat leaves on Saturday.

23:27.843 --> 23:30.470
And I'll buy a car
in Los Angeles...

23:30.554 --> 23:33.140
and drive up to Utah,
to the Bonneville Salt Flats.

23:33.390 --> 23:36.685
- Its really important you do this trip?
- Sure is mate, you know.

23:37.519 --> 23:41.106
Ever since I was a lad I've been
interested in things that go fast...

23:41.315 --> 23:43.233
you know things
that rolls and go and...

23:43.650 --> 23:46.987
at Bonneville things go real fast.
Its...

23:47.237 --> 23:50.532
this giant dried up lake bed...

23:50.782 --> 23:53.410
and it goes for miles
and miles and its dead flat...

23:53.493 --> 23:57.456
and you can drive a vehicle just
as fast as it will go and its.

23:57.706 --> 24:00.709
So its one of the few places
on earth...

24:00.792 --> 24:04.921
where you can find out just what
you're machine is capable of.

24:05.213 --> 24:09.759
In fact here I'm on the, thats me on the
front of the New Zealand Motorcyclist.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.344
Thats the Indian there.

24:11.428 --> 24:13.597
- Very good!
- Yeah, a few years ago.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.599
So I'd best be off soon...

24:15.599 --> 24:18.143
because I don't know how much longer
I've got to live you see.

24:18.143 --> 24:20.562
Yes, I don't think
I heard that last statement.

24:20.562 --> 24:22.772
I said I don't know
how much longer I've got to live.

24:22.772 --> 24:24.357
I heard you the first time.

24:24.691 --> 24:26.318
So... tell me, Burt.

24:26.568 --> 24:29.404
What are you offering
as collateral for this loan?

24:29.529 --> 24:34.117
Well, my tools, my bits and pieces, my
trophies and a lot of things like this.

24:34.159 --> 24:37.203
Well, I don't think they'd be
of much interest to the bank...

24:37.203 --> 24:39.497
I think we'd be looking for
something more substantial.

24:39.497 --> 24:42.417
Something like the deed
of title to your property.

24:44.419 --> 24:48.131
- Did you get the money?
- Yep, I'm off on Thursday.

24:48.548 --> 24:51.468
Thursday? That soon?
I wish I could come too.

24:52.218 --> 24:53.553
Oh, maybe next time.

24:55.889 --> 24:58.808
Thomas. Its dinner time.
Come home now.

24:59.017 --> 25:02.187
- Nearly finished, Mrs. Jackson.
- Yeah, Mum, we're almost finished.

25:04.814 --> 25:06.316
See you after dinner, Burt.

25:07.192 --> 25:08.443
Alright, lad.

25:16.534 --> 25:18.203
Hey, not so fast.

25:18.453 --> 25:20.079
I'm the record breaker.

25:22.957 --> 25:24.292
Where are you going?

25:26.044 --> 25:27.712
And thats the...

25:28.296 --> 25:31.424
before I put the...
you know, the streamliner on it.

25:35.678 --> 25:36.679
Whats that one?

25:37.430 --> 25:41.726
Thats a girlfriend of mine
when I first bought the bike.

25:41.809 --> 25:43.478
It was a long time ago that was.

25:46.481 --> 25:49.442
Aren't you scared you'll kill
yourself if you crash?

25:49.734 --> 25:50.652
No...

25:50.944 --> 25:52.820
you...

25:52.820 --> 25:56.366
live more in five minutes
on a bike like this...

25:56.658 --> 25:59.202
going flat out than some people
live in a lifetime.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.704
And...

26:01.704 --> 26:05.959
yeah, more in five minutes.
Thats my Dad there.

26:07.168 --> 26:08.670
And my mum.

26:10.129 --> 26:11.506
They're all gone.

26:13.758 --> 26:15.718
God, its gone by so fast!

26:16.636 --> 26:19.514
You know,
danger is the spice of life...

26:19.722 --> 26:22.809
and you've got to take a risk every now
and again haven't you, son?

26:23.101 --> 26:26.229
You know thats
what makes life worthwhile.

26:27.397 --> 26:31.150
And you know,
having some nice ladies around...

26:31.442 --> 26:33.694
will you pick out my bike?

26:34.237 --> 26:37.573
- You really don't get scared?
- No, no.

26:39.158 --> 26:40.118
You know...

26:40.576 --> 26:43.246
when I was a boy
about your age...

26:43.579 --> 26:46.541
I had a little twin brother
whose name was Ernie...

26:46.791 --> 26:51.170
and one day our Dad was out
the back cutting down a tree...

26:51.921 --> 26:52.922
and...

26:53.714 --> 26:58.636
suddenly it got hung up, the tree
that is, it got stuck on something and...

26:59.637 --> 27:02.974
Ernie went to go and help.
All of a sudden the tree...

27:03.474 --> 27:07.478
slipped and fell on him
and killed him stone dead.

27:12.942 --> 27:14.860
I always remember that.

27:15.152 --> 27:20.074
Anyway, since then I've always tried
never to be scared of anything.

27:20.533 --> 27:21.951
Although I must say before...

27:21.951 --> 27:25.204
a big bike event I do
sometimes get nervous, you know...

27:26.998 --> 27:31.460
if the butterflies
in my stomach were cows...

27:31.711 --> 27:34.714
I'd be able to start
a dairy farm.

27:36.132 --> 27:37.508
Thats funny.

27:38.634 --> 27:42.763
When they took you off in the ambulance
to the hospital. What happened?

27:43.013 --> 27:45.683
I don't know, just a touch
of indigestion I think.

27:46.016 --> 27:49.520
Yeah, thats all it was. There's nothing
wrong with me, don't you worry about me.

27:49.687 --> 27:51.397
And anyway at my age...

27:51.689 --> 27:55.234
any day above ground
and vertical is a good day.

27:55.860 --> 27:58.904
Listen, you take care
of this until I get back alright?

27:59.572 --> 28:03.450
- What happens if you don't come back?
- We'll talk about that then shan't we.

28:06.036 --> 28:07.580
- Hey, Burt?
- Yeah.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.498
Don't forget
to mow your lawns will you?

28:09.582 --> 28:11.792
- What?
- Don't forget to mow your lawns.

28:11.876 --> 28:13.669
My Dad goes on and on about it.

28:13.878 --> 28:14.962
He does, does he?

28:15.170 --> 28:18.257
He says it lowers the property
values of the neighborhood.

28:19.758 --> 28:22.845
Well, oh dear,
we can't have that can we?

28:46.452 --> 28:47.494
What are you doing?

28:47.745 --> 28:50.039
Hello, son.
I'm just getting rid of the grass.

28:52.916 --> 28:55.669
Burt, what the hell
are you doing this time?

28:55.919 --> 28:59.089
Oh, like you said George
I'm getting rid of the grass...

28:59.548 --> 29:02.134
being a good neighbor
before I leave tomorrow.

29:02.468 --> 29:04.887
Tom, Tom!
Get back inside now!

29:05.679 --> 29:06.847
Now!

29:08.390 --> 29:09.641
Honestly, Burt!

29:13.896 --> 29:16.607
- What are they doing here?
- It might be the fire, Burt.

29:25.616 --> 29:27.534
Right, the tyre goes in first.

29:28.285 --> 29:29.536
Thats it.

29:30.245 --> 29:32.539
Thats it, Jeff. You've got it.

29:33.248 --> 29:34.750
This goes in here.

29:36.543 --> 29:37.836
Pills...

29:38.670 --> 29:40.005
license, passport.

29:41.048 --> 29:43.508
Right, lets see,
I've got everything?

29:44.426 --> 29:47.929
Spectacles, testicles,
watch and wallet.

29:48.096 --> 29:49.514
What are you laughing at?

29:49.890 --> 29:51.058
I'm on my way.

29:51.266 --> 29:53.685
- Dad says to call us collect.
- What?

29:53.769 --> 29:55.354
Dad says to call us collect.

29:55.771 --> 29:57.814
- Thats nice of him.
- Tell us how you get on.

29:58.565 --> 29:59.524
Thank you.

29:59.775 --> 30:01.276
Thats our phone number.

30:02.611 --> 30:06.031
- Do you think you'll break the record?
- Well, I hope so.

30:06.865 --> 30:08.825
Dad doesn't think
you can do it.

30:10.994 --> 30:12.370
Is that what he said?

30:12.829 --> 30:14.623
He said everyone thinks that.

30:15.332 --> 30:16.583
Well...

30:17.918 --> 30:19.086
Except me.

30:24.466 --> 30:26.885
You're a good boy, Tom.

30:31.181 --> 30:32.974
I'll tell you something, son.

30:33.225 --> 30:37.145
If you don't follow through on your
dreams, you might as well be a vegetable.

30:38.939 --> 30:40.607
What type of vegetable?

30:41.066 --> 30:42.317
I don't know...

30:43.026 --> 30:43.985
a cabbage.

30:45.070 --> 30:46.238
Yeah...

30:46.488 --> 30:47.739
<i>a cabbage.</i>

30:49.699 --> 30:51.534
There you are.
Don't lose it, will you?

30:51.534 --> 30:53.787
- I promise I'll look after it.
- Right.

30:55.914 --> 30:58.917
So keep an eye on the place
for me won't you, Tom.

30:59.459 --> 31:00.460
And...

31:02.087 --> 31:03.964
don't forget
to feed the fowls.

31:04.047 --> 31:05.507
- Thats my job.
- Yeah.

31:05.715 --> 31:06.716
And...

31:06.716 --> 31:09.970
you can give
the eggs to Mum and...

31:10.220 --> 31:11.721
what else is there?

31:12.555 --> 31:13.556
Oh, yes...

31:14.140 --> 31:18.436
you can pee on my lemon tree
for me if you like, while I'm away.

31:18.436 --> 31:21.398
And there's nothing wrong
with peeing on your lemon tree...

31:21.481 --> 31:25.318
as Confucius used to say, its the best
natural fertilizer in the world.

31:25.568 --> 31:28.029
- Who's Confucius?
- He's some bloke who lives up in Dunedin.

31:28.613 --> 31:30.156
Thanks for you help, chaps.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.950
- Good luck, Burt.
- Thanks, Jeff.

31:32.033 --> 31:34.619
- You show them over there in the States.
- I will.

31:34.869 --> 31:35.829
Take it easy, Burt.

31:35.912 --> 31:38.540
Thats not one of the things
I'm planning on doing, George.

31:38.623 --> 31:40.041
Cheerio, love.

31:40.083 --> 31:41.126
Good luck.

31:41.209 --> 31:42.502
Cheerio, my friend.

31:42.919 --> 31:45.672
If you don't go when you wanna go
when you do go, you'll find you're gone.

31:45.755 --> 31:47.298
- I'll see ya.
- See ya, Burt.

31:47.757 --> 31:48.967
Bye, Burt.

31:49.467 --> 31:50.802
- Good luck.
- Cheerio.

31:51.553 --> 31:52.387
See ya, Burt.

32:05.900 --> 32:06.859
Look at that!

32:17.120 --> 32:20.665
Well, Fran,
I'm finally on my way.

32:24.127 --> 32:27.588
I thought some more
of the blokes from the club...

32:27.672 --> 32:29.924
would have dropped
by to see me off.

32:30.550 --> 32:32.969
Well, they probably had
to work today.

32:33.219 --> 32:34.846
Yeah. Yeah, thats right.

32:35.847 --> 32:38.307
Yeah, young Tom tells me...

32:39.434 --> 32:41.269
that no one thinks
I can do it.

32:41.769 --> 32:45.231
- Do you think I can do it, Fran?
- I don't know, Burt.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.650
I don't think it really matters
one way or the other.

32:53.614 --> 32:56.284
You know, I read something once,
years ago.

32:57.535 --> 32:59.495
I learnt it off by heart.

33:00.705 --> 33:03.916
It was Theodore Roosevelt
said it...

33:05.084 --> 33:08.838
its not
the critic that counts...

33:09.088 --> 33:13.217
not the man who points out
how the strong man stumbles...

33:13.467 --> 33:18.264
or where the doer of deeds
could have done them better.

33:20.516 --> 33:24.645
The credit belongs to the man
who is actually in the arena.

33:33.988 --> 33:35.990
Wind your window down!
Down.

33:36.157 --> 33:37.533
What?

33:37.950 --> 33:39.410
Some beer money.

33:39.452 --> 33:41.620
- What?
- Some beer money.

33:42.538 --> 33:44.081
I don't drink.

33:44.957 --> 33:46.500
Good luck.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.002
- You go well.
- Thanks, mate.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.795
Show them Kiwi's can fly.

33:49.879 --> 33:52.882
Yeah, I'll bring you back
the Statue of Liberty.

33:53.549 --> 33:54.884
Good on you mate,
thanks a lot.

34:13.444 --> 34:15.029
Hey, not so fast!

34:17.531 --> 34:18.616
Crikey!

34:20.367 --> 34:21.702
Take it easy, mate!

34:24.330 --> 34:25.789
I thought it was a goner.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.505
Better get going.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.716
Yeah, alright...

34:36.382 --> 34:39.011
take care of the old jalopy,
won't you?

34:40.638 --> 34:42.514
- You look after yourself.
- I will.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.266
You've got your pills
and everything, right?

34:44.266 --> 34:46.185
Yeah, yeah, right as rain.

34:51.065 --> 34:54.068
- You come back in one piece.
- I will, cheerio.

35:04.244 --> 35:05.537
Where's the Captain?

35:05.621 --> 35:06.997
Down below.

35:07.164 --> 35:08.916
- Down the gangway there.
- Thanks.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.543
There we are.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.796
I'm looking for the Captain.

35:14.254 --> 35:15.422
Thats me.

35:16.673 --> 35:18.675
My name's Burt Munro.

35:21.470 --> 35:25.224
I'm supposed to do a job to work
my passage to Los Angeles.

35:25.474 --> 35:27.893
- Yeah, well, I hope you can cook.
- Cook?

35:30.062 --> 35:32.022
- I'll give it a go.
- There's the galley.

35:36.777 --> 35:37.528
Crikey!

35:38.946 --> 35:40.364
Who does the dishes, mate?

35:41.031 --> 35:42.115
You.

35:47.663 --> 35:49.081
Smells good.

35:49.331 --> 35:50.958
What do you have
for us today, Burt?

35:51.208 --> 35:53.001
Its good Kiwi tucker.

35:55.671 --> 35:58.173
Don't let Burt see you
doing that.

35:58.590 --> 36:01.218
Here, don't spoil it
with all that sauce.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.470
- Sorry, Burt.
- Stone the crows!

36:08.976 --> 36:10.268
Are you going to watch
the movie, Burt?

36:10.268 --> 36:12.938
- Whats that?
- Are you going to watch the movie?

36:14.022 --> 36:16.358
- Whats it called?
- Broken Barrier.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.946
- Its supposed to be good.
- Is Jane Russell in it?

36:21.697 --> 36:23.532
There's a spare seat
over here, Burt.

36:31.373 --> 36:32.332
Smoke?

36:32.666 --> 36:35.085
- No. Not for me, mate.
- You don't smoke Burt?

36:35.085 --> 36:37.462
No, I don't
and thats why people say to me...

36:37.712 --> 36:39.714
how do you keep going
at your age, Burt...

36:39.714 --> 36:41.424
and I say,
well because I don't smoke...

36:41.424 --> 36:44.219
so I'm telling you young monkeys,
don't smoke.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.639
You can laugh,
but my Dad said...

36:47.889 --> 36:50.016
why contaminate your lungs
with tobacco smoke?

36:50.267 --> 36:53.395
The only thing you accomplish with
smoking is destroying your lungs...

36:53.395 --> 36:55.939
- and shortening your life.
- Kill the lights.

36:59.860 --> 37:00.902
Is Jane Russell in this?

37:02.153 --> 37:03.488
Go well, Burt.

37:04.864 --> 37:06.866
- Thanks, mate.
- Not for this.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.208
- Good luck to you, Burt.
- Thanks.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.294
Remember what I said.
Don't smoke.

37:18.086 --> 37:19.045
I'm trying.

37:19.337 --> 37:20.755
Cheerio, mates. See ya.

37:22.382 --> 37:24.676
Welcome to the United States.
Customs to the left.

37:24.759 --> 37:26.344
Thank you, good to be here.

37:26.803 --> 37:27.887
G'day.

37:34.310 --> 37:35.395
G'day.

37:35.645 --> 37:38.148
Please, stand behind the yellow line
until you are called, sir.

37:38.231 --> 37:39.232
Whats that?

37:39.357 --> 37:41.860
- Behind the yellow line.
- Yellow line?

37:52.078 --> 37:53.037
G'day.

37:53.121 --> 37:55.623
Passport and customs declaration,
please sir.

37:56.958 --> 37:58.293
There you are.

38:03.673 --> 38:05.884
How long do you intend
to stay in the United States?

38:06.092 --> 38:10.263
However long it takes me to get
to Bonneville and back.

38:10.471 --> 38:12.473
And the purpose of your visit?

38:12.473 --> 38:15.852
To set a land speed record
on my Indian.

38:16.936 --> 38:17.896
Indian?

38:18.313 --> 38:19.439
Mr. Munro...

38:19.689 --> 38:21.733
- So this is your first time to America?
- Yes, sir.

38:21.983 --> 38:24.694
You gave some rather odd answers
to the Officer...

38:24.944 --> 38:26.779
so we just have a few further
questions we'd like to ask you.

38:26.863 --> 38:30.533
- Well, fire away.
- Well, lets go over again what you said.

38:30.908 --> 38:33.661
Now what exactly do you intend to do
here in the United States?

38:33.911 --> 38:35.788
Well, set a land speed record.

38:36.873 --> 38:39.959
- And how do you intend to do that, sir?
- On my motorcycle.

38:40.251 --> 38:43.504
Its in the hold of the ship
at the moment and...

38:43.755 --> 38:48.426
they're going to unload it tomorrow.
Its an Indian, a 1920 Indian Scout...

38:49.302 --> 38:50.845
modified somewhat.

38:51.804 --> 38:52.764
You know what?

38:53.389 --> 38:55.641
- I think I've read about your bike.
- Yeah?

38:55.850 --> 38:58.936
Yeah, it was in Popular Mechanics,
a couple of years ago.

38:59.145 --> 39:00.730
Thats right, thats me.

39:00.980 --> 39:04.108
A Leslie Hobbs from Christchurch
sent that story.

39:04.317 --> 39:07.111
What was it?
Fastest motorcycle in Australia?

39:07.361 --> 39:09.155
Yeah, and in New Zealand.

39:11.532 --> 39:13.659
Well, I guess you're legitimate,
Mr. Munro.

39:13.910 --> 39:16.621
It sounds like we should be very
honored to have you here in America.

39:16.871 --> 39:19.332
- Well, thank you.
- We're going to give you six months...

39:19.582 --> 39:21.584
that should be time enough
to get the job done.

39:23.711 --> 39:26.088
- Welcome to the USA.
- Thank you very much.

39:26.297 --> 39:27.924
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

39:35.223 --> 39:36.724
- Gears in the trunk.
- What?

39:36.974 --> 39:38.309
Bags in the back.

39:38.851 --> 39:40.227
Bag, back!

39:40.394 --> 39:43.314
Don't worry about me,
I'll do it myself.

39:43.856 --> 39:45.107
Strewth!

39:58.663 --> 40:00.456
Sit in the back, in the back!

40:00.706 --> 40:02.708
- What?
- You, in the back!

40:04.335 --> 40:08.130
Tell you something, mate,
you don't want to get old around here.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.301
Ta ra.

40:14.929 --> 40:16.555
- Where to?
- What?

40:16.806 --> 40:19.225
- Where to?
- Hollywood.

40:19.225 --> 40:22.603
Yeah, I want to go to Hollywood,
I want to see the film stars.

40:23.062 --> 40:25.272
Okay, we go to Hollywood.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.233
Where in Hollywood?

40:27.983 --> 40:31.403
A motel on Sunset Boulevard...

40:32.112 --> 40:33.948
I hear thats a pretty great street.

40:34.156 --> 40:37.159
I don't know who you talking to lately.
Which motel?

40:37.409 --> 40:38.577
I don't know...

40:38.828 --> 40:39.995
a recommended one.

40:40.287 --> 40:42.748
Come on man, what do you think
I am, an encyclopedia?

40:42.915 --> 40:46.669
Drop me somewhere
and I'll sort it out myself.

40:54.843 --> 40:57.096
Must have a bit
electricity bill here.

41:01.308 --> 41:02.643
Firestone...

41:03.602 --> 41:04.687
Shell.

41:06.689 --> 41:10.401
Its all about cars, isn't it?
I've never seen so many cars.

41:10.859 --> 41:14.488
- You say something, man?
- I said I've never seen so many cars.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.116
Got to get around somehow.

41:21.912 --> 41:25.040
Look, there's a bowling alley.
Do you bowl?

41:31.296 --> 41:33.215
Whats he honking his horn about?

41:36.510 --> 41:38.929
Jesus!
Crikey, did you see that?

41:40.013 --> 41:42.057
That blokes backing into that
geaser's car.

41:42.933 --> 41:44.476
He's crazy, he's nuts.

41:45.352 --> 41:46.937
He did it again.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.691
Don't stare, there's a lot of
crazy people in this town.

41:50.941 --> 41:52.734
I've never seen anything
like that before.

42:03.829 --> 42:05.956
- This should do...
- Whats the damage?

42:06.665 --> 42:08.083
US$28, plus bag...

42:08.458 --> 42:10.294
- US$29.
- What?

42:11.712 --> 42:14.506
Did you just say
what I thought you said?

42:14.673 --> 42:16.800
- Are you deaf?
- What?

42:16.925 --> 42:20.345
- Are you deaf?
- Yeah, I am a bit deaf, but I'm not stupid.

42:20.470 --> 42:23.348
- How much did you say it was?
- US$29.

42:23.557 --> 42:27.978
No, I don't want to buy the cab, mate.
I just want to pay the fare, thats all.

42:27.978 --> 42:29.646
- Where you from?
- What?

42:29.855 --> 42:32.941
- You a British?
- No, you must be joking...

42:33.150 --> 42:35.402
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from New Zealand.

42:35.694 --> 42:37.070
Well, this is America.

42:37.946 --> 42:40.866
And the fare, right there on the meter,
US$29.

42:41.241 --> 42:43.827
Open your wallet
and let the moths out.

42:44.035 --> 42:45.412
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

42:46.037 --> 42:48.665
There you go, US$29.

42:48.874 --> 42:50.751
- No, don't forget the tip.
- What?

42:50.959 --> 42:53.253
Yes, we tip in America.

42:53.503 --> 42:54.379
Ten percent.

42:54.463 --> 42:56.214
- How much?
- Ten percent.

42:58.175 --> 42:59.676
Oh yeah, there you go, ten cents.

43:08.310 --> 43:09.811
Excuse me, sir.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.105
- You look like a generous man, sir.
- What?

43:12.314 --> 43:14.149
- You look like a generous man.
- Oh do I?

43:14.357 --> 43:17.694
Yes you do. Would you like to buy
a flower to give to someone special?

43:17.903 --> 43:19.988
Well,
sorry I don't have any cash.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.407
Don't worry,
the money goes to a good cause.

43:22.657 --> 43:25.285
Its for an organization
that helps needy people.

43:25.535 --> 43:27.495
Oh alright, well, how much is it?

43:27.746 --> 43:30.081
- Just give what you can afford.
- Alright, well.

43:31.958 --> 43:34.002
They all look the same to me.
They're all green.

43:34.085 --> 43:36.755
- Yes, thats why we call them green backs.
- That looks like a one.

43:37.047 --> 43:38.423
- Look there's one.
- No, thats a ten.

43:38.506 --> 43:40.300
- Thanks, you have a good day.
- No, thats a ten.

43:40.592 --> 43:42.427
Hey come on miss, thats a ten.

43:42.802 --> 43:44.012
I didn't want to pay that much.

43:44.387 --> 43:45.722
Hey, come back.

43:50.685 --> 43:52.145
- Hey baby.
- What do you want?

43:52.354 --> 43:53.688
- You wanna go?
- Go where?

43:54.898 --> 43:57.275
- Go inside.
- I'm going inside.

43:58.068 --> 43:59.944
I'll take you around the world.

44:00.153 --> 44:01.946
I've just come from halfway
around the world.

44:02.030 --> 44:03.740
15 bucks, baby.

44:03.782 --> 44:05.033
15 bucks.

44:05.241 --> 44:07.035
No, sorry, go away.

44:14.209 --> 44:15.168
Hello.

44:20.340 --> 44:23.510
- I need a room.
- A room will cost you five bucks an hour.

44:23.593 --> 44:25.637
I'm planning on staying
a wee bit longer than that.

44:25.762 --> 44:28.473
- How long?
- I don't know, a couple of days I guess.

44:28.515 --> 44:30.683
- Double occupancy?
- What?

44:30.934 --> 44:32.310
Double occupancy?

44:32.518 --> 44:34.979
No, just me, myself and I.

44:35.730 --> 44:38.942
Will it cost a lot because
I can't afford a lot.

44:40.235 --> 44:42.320
- You a member of Triple A?
- What?

44:42.570 --> 44:44.989
- Are you a Triple A member?
- Never heard of them.

44:45.239 --> 44:46.449
Never heard of Triple A?

44:46.699 --> 44:49.953
No Miss Brittle Britches,
I have not heard of Triple A.

44:51.496 --> 44:53.748
Okay, lets just say
you are a member doll.

44:53.748 --> 44:55.458
- Alright.
- Thatll save you ten percent.

44:56.751 --> 44:58.753
How does 22 bucks a night sound?

44:59.128 --> 45:01.255
That much? Is that cheap?

45:02.340 --> 45:03.716
Honey, thats cheaper than cheap.

45:07.011 --> 45:09.931
- Whats your name?
- Tina Washington.

45:10.181 --> 45:11.432
Well, Tina Washington,

45:11.432 --> 45:14.018
I want you to have this,
it might cheer you up a bit.

45:14.352 --> 45:16.437
Get some of that muck
off your pluck.

45:16.938 --> 45:18.272
Well, thank you.

45:18.856 --> 45:21.150
Thats the first nice thing
thats happened round here all week.

45:21.192 --> 45:22.527
You're welcome.

45:22.860 --> 45:25.863
My name's Burt Munro.
From New Zealand.

45:25.905 --> 45:27.406
I'm from down under.

45:27.698 --> 45:29.784
Well, hello, Burt Munro
from New Zealand down under.

45:30.034 --> 45:32.119
I tell you,
I've had a heck of a night.

45:32.870 --> 45:34.455
Welcome to Hollyweird.

46:26.382 --> 46:27.758
Hello?

46:28.008 --> 46:29.260
Anybody home?

46:31.387 --> 46:33.389
- Hello, Tina.
- Good morning, Burt.

46:33.639 --> 46:35.141
You still here?

46:36.475 --> 46:39.311
Thats why you were
so crabby last night.

46:39.520 --> 46:40.896
Don't you ever get any sleep?

46:41.147 --> 46:42.606
I work a night shift.

46:42.898 --> 46:45.359
I'm out of here as soon as James
turns up and he's late.

46:46.569 --> 46:49.697
Yeah, could you phone
this number for me?

46:50.030 --> 46:53.409
Yeah, its a shipping company
and they've got a big box of mine...

46:53.784 --> 46:56.954
and I want to know how
to arrange to get it.

46:59.206 --> 47:01.333
No, you talk to them,
they'll never get my accent.

47:01.584 --> 47:04.044
Okay, what do you want me
to ask them? One moment please.

47:04.128 --> 47:08.841
Ask them when a Burt Munro's box
containing the motorcycle...

47:08.841 --> 47:10.009
will be ready for pick up.

47:10.801 --> 47:13.345
Hello, I'm calling
for Mr. Burt Munro.

47:13.470 --> 47:16.223
Yes, he'd like to know when the box
containing his motorcycle...

47:16.223 --> 47:18.392
<i>- will be available for pick up.
- What ship?</i>

47:18.934 --> 47:21.312
- What ship?
- Rangatira from New Zealand.

47:21.562 --> 47:23.689
The Rangatira from New Zealand.

47:23.814 --> 47:25.524
<i>- Its arrived.
- So he can claim it?</i>

47:27.568 --> 47:29.987
Tomorrow from the Long Beach
customs holding area.

47:30.237 --> 47:32.156
Okay, thank you, I'll tell him.
Bye-bye.

47:32.489 --> 47:34.033
That was pretty fast.

47:34.366 --> 47:35.868
You're late.

47:38.078 --> 47:41.457
I can't stand another minute in
this place. Let me buy you breakfast.

47:44.877 --> 47:46.128
Well, this is great.

47:46.503 --> 47:50.299
You know, I've never seen
a menu with photographs before.

47:51.550 --> 47:53.051
- Are you ready to order, sir?
- What?

47:53.343 --> 47:55.137
- Are you ready?
- Oh yes...

47:56.346 --> 48:00.017
I think the Double Delight,
thats for me.

48:00.726 --> 48:02.519
- How would you like your eggs?
- What?

48:02.769 --> 48:04.313
How would you like your eggs?

48:05.105 --> 48:06.356
Well, I'd like them cooked.

48:07.274 --> 48:10.194
Sunny side up? Over easy?

48:10.569 --> 48:13.822
- I don't know, whatever you recommend.
- Over easy's best.

48:14.615 --> 48:16.158
Alright, eggs over easy.

48:16.491 --> 48:17.659
Make that two.

48:17.951 --> 48:20.621
Over easy.
I must remember that.

48:20.871 --> 48:23.624
Yeah, I like this American
breakfast thing.

48:24.333 --> 48:25.334
Its good.

48:27.002 --> 48:31.423
So my girl, where's the best place
for me to get a used car?

48:31.632 --> 48:32.924
The Valley.

48:33.467 --> 48:35.469
After breakfast I could
take you there.

48:35.552 --> 48:36.511
Oh Well, thank you.

48:38.597 --> 48:40.223
And I'm not a girl.

48:42.392 --> 48:43.393
I'm a boy.

48:48.440 --> 48:50.859
I thought there was something
a little odd about you.

48:50.859 --> 48:53.779
But hey,
you're still a sweetheart.

48:56.656 --> 48:57.574
Yep.

49:11.713 --> 49:12.964
Thanks a million, Tina.

49:13.298 --> 49:15.300
Hey,
there are stacks of cars here.

49:16.051 --> 49:18.303
- I'll be back in the motel later on.
- Bye.

49:19.554 --> 49:20.680
Bye.

49:26.895 --> 49:28.271
How may I help you, sir?

49:28.522 --> 49:32.400
Yeah, I want to buy a car,
a cheap car, a very cheap car.

49:32.484 --> 49:34.694
Well, you've come
to the right place, amigo.

49:35.070 --> 49:39.324
In fact, if you can find cars like this
any cheaper, they're probably stolen.

49:39.574 --> 49:42.953
My name's Burt, Burt Munro
from New Zealand. Nice to meet you.

49:43.245 --> 49:45.789
I'm Fernando from El Salvador,
nice to meet you, Mr. Munro.

49:45.830 --> 49:48.458
- You can call me Burt.
- Alright, Mr. Burt.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.295
So how much were you looking
to spend here Mr. Burt?

49:52.295 --> 49:53.588
Not a lot Fernando...

49:53.838 --> 49:56.466
I haven't got much left after
the cab ride I took yesterday.

49:57.717 --> 49:59.594
You want US$399 for this?

50:00.512 --> 50:02.263
It sounds a bit sick.

50:02.472 --> 50:04.057
Well, what would you offer me?

50:04.474 --> 50:07.352
Listen, I'll give you US$200
if you'll do me a favor.

50:08.186 --> 50:11.064
Through in the use
of your workshop...

50:11.272 --> 50:13.733
and some of that junk
I see lying around...

50:14.401 --> 50:17.112
I've got to knock up
a trailer...

50:17.487 --> 50:19.614
to drag my bike over
to Bonneville.

50:19.864 --> 50:21.866
Thats not a favor,
US$325 is a favor.

50:22.075 --> 50:24.244
No, US$225.

50:25.203 --> 50:27.872
You're a tough customer, Mr. Burt,
but I like you...

50:28.164 --> 50:31.459
I'm going to give it to you for US$250
and you can use the workshop...

50:31.543 --> 50:33.920
but only at night
and keep the noise down.

50:33.920 --> 50:34.629
What about tonight?

50:35.046 --> 50:36.589
Yeah, yeah, tonights ok.

50:36.840 --> 50:40.426
Stop the car, lets get
this thing running properly.

50:54.274 --> 50:55.650
There that sounds better.

50:57.527 --> 51:00.655
- Let me drive.
- Okay, come on.

51:00.863 --> 51:03.241
She's singing
like a bird now.

51:03.658 --> 51:05.827
Oh, she's a good old girl,
isn't she?

51:06.035 --> 51:07.495
There we are, alright.

51:14.335 --> 51:17.630
- You make a left here, Mr. Burt.
- Alright.

51:21.467 --> 51:23.511
The buggers are in the wrong lane.

51:23.761 --> 51:25.221
Stop the car, stop the car.

51:27.473 --> 51:29.434
Turn, turn, this way.

51:30.351 --> 51:31.936
Stop, stop the car.

51:34.272 --> 51:36.023
Keep your shirt on.

51:38.151 --> 51:41.487
- Scoot over, you stupid old bastard.
- Thought I was back in New Zealand...

51:41.487 --> 51:44.031
we drive on the other side
of the road over there.

51:44.323 --> 51:46.784
Yeah? You're going to get
us all killed.

51:48.286 --> 51:51.122
Well, you're not in New Zealand,
you're in America.

51:51.164 --> 51:53.916
- I know it.
- We drive on the right side of the road.

52:03.467 --> 52:06.554
Burt.
Let me give you some advice.

52:08.639 --> 52:11.350
When you're driving,
not only here in America...

52:11.475 --> 52:13.185
but anywhere's around the world...

52:13.394 --> 52:16.647
the driver should always
be in the centre of the road.

52:17.064 --> 52:19.442
In the centre.
If you're not in the centre...

52:19.442 --> 52:22.361
you're on the wrong side of the road.
Okay?

52:32.163 --> 52:34.081
You want this right here?

52:37.251 --> 52:38.419
Thats it.

52:38.878 --> 52:40.004
Yeah, good.

52:40.463 --> 52:41.589
Got it.

52:42.048 --> 52:43.841
Its 3 am in the morning.

52:44.091 --> 52:47.011
Yeah, time flies
when you're having fun, doesn't it?

52:48.095 --> 52:51.098
You know, when I told you that
you could use the workshop at night...

52:51.098 --> 52:53.058
I didn't mean all night.
My wife's gonna kill me.

52:53.601 --> 52:56.312
You take yourself off home
and I'll have a snooze...

52:56.312 --> 52:58.939
in the back of the car
and you know, mate...

52:59.190 --> 53:01.525
I'll lock up the place
before I go to sleep.

53:01.525 --> 53:05.070
Seems to me a whole lot of effort
to sell a lousy US$250 motorcar.

53:05.613 --> 53:08.532
Okay, Mr. Burt, you pull the door down.
Have a good night.

53:09.658 --> 53:14.413
Fernando.
Where do I take a leak around here?

53:15.206 --> 53:16.790
- Leak?
- Yeah, a pee...

53:17.041 --> 53:19.084
trouble with the old prostrate,
you know.

53:19.376 --> 53:22.671
Yeah, go straight through those doors,
there's a door there that says Caballero...

53:23.130 --> 53:24.089
Alright.

53:25.090 --> 53:27.092
Well, I'll see you in the morning,
early okay?

53:27.176 --> 53:28.385
Good night.

53:29.136 --> 53:29.929
Where were we?

53:34.141 --> 53:34.767
Burt?

53:37.019 --> 53:38.604
Good morning, Mr. Burt.

53:42.107 --> 53:44.401
- So did you get it all finished?
- Yeah.

53:44.693 --> 53:48.781
All I need to do is find a couple
of wheels and I'll be ready to roll.

53:49.031 --> 53:51.992
Well, you know, I have some wheels
in the back you can have...

53:51.992 --> 53:54.203
- if you just do me a favor.
- Say the word.

53:57.623 --> 53:59.166
Crank her now, Fernando.

54:00.250 --> 54:01.293
Good.

54:02.878 --> 54:03.962
- Burt?
- Yeah?

54:04.379 --> 54:05.422
You're a god damned genius.

54:05.631 --> 54:06.590
Thank you.

54:06.757 --> 54:08.842
Hey listen, why you gotta go?

54:09.093 --> 54:10.803
Why don't you stick around here a while?
I'll pay you well.

54:11.053 --> 54:13.305
Sorry, mate, I've got to get
to Bonneville by the 23rd...

54:13.514 --> 54:17.351
thats when speed week starts and
you know, gotta hit the road.

54:17.601 --> 54:20.646
- Well, you've always got a job here.
- Thanks mate, I'll see ya.

54:20.979 --> 54:22.689
- Best of luck to you.
- Ta ra.

54:23.857 --> 54:25.776
This guy is really good.

54:37.496 --> 54:38.830
Hello, love.

54:39.081 --> 54:40.874
I was worried about you.

54:41.124 --> 54:44.169
Housekeeping said you didn't
sleep in your bed all night.

54:44.419 --> 54:45.963
Do I get a discount for that?

54:46.546 --> 54:47.547
I doubt it.

54:47.589 --> 54:50.092
I need you to show me on a map
how to get to Long Beach...

54:50.175 --> 54:53.053
- so I can pick up my bike today.
- I'm finished here in 15 minutes.

54:53.178 --> 54:54.137
I'll come with you.

54:57.891 --> 55:00.727
Not a bad set of wheels
for 250 bucks eh?

55:00.894 --> 55:03.063
- You sure itll make it to Utah?
- Yeah.

55:03.689 --> 55:06.483
This old girl will get you
to New Zealand and back.

55:06.942 --> 55:08.068
Here...

55:08.318 --> 55:10.195
- hop in my fair, lady.
- Thank you.

55:12.823 --> 55:15.283
The bloke who sold me this car,
he gave me a good tip...

55:15.367 --> 55:18.703
he said always remember
that the driver, thats me...

55:18.870 --> 55:21.373
should be on the centre
of the road.

55:21.415 --> 55:22.999
- Look out, look out!
- Alright.

55:23.250 --> 55:27.003
In New Zealand we always drive
on the other side of the street.

55:28.130 --> 55:30.215
- You do?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.093
Do you want me to drive?

55:33.093 --> 55:35.345
No, its alright,
I have to get used to it, haven't I?

55:38.515 --> 55:40.308
This should be customs
right here.

55:40.350 --> 55:41.351
Right.

55:47.774 --> 55:49.609
- Hello.
- May I help you, sir?

55:49.859 --> 55:53.655
Yeah, my name's Burt Munro and
I've come to pick up my motorcycle...

55:53.905 --> 55:56.491
I came into port two days ago
from New Zealand...

55:56.741 --> 55:59.744
and on a freighter
called Rangatira...

55:59.953 --> 56:02.455
and I was told to come here
to clear it through customs.

56:03.790 --> 56:05.792
- Mr. Munro.
- Yeah, Munro...

56:06.084 --> 56:07.544
M U N R O.

56:10.380 --> 56:12.549
- Wait here a moment, sir.
- Thank you.

56:16.011 --> 56:18.722
Mr. Munro is here
for that damaged shipment.

56:21.975 --> 56:23.935
- Mr. Moonro.
- Munro.

56:24.185 --> 56:26.604
- Come with me please, to the storage area.
- Is there a problem?

56:26.604 --> 56:28.690
Your consignment
has suffered some damage.

56:29.399 --> 56:30.692
Oh, no.

56:31.234 --> 56:34.571
Why the heck did I bother to paint
these arrows on the side of it then?

56:35.405 --> 56:37.949
Thats the way it was
delivered here unfortunately.

56:37.949 --> 56:39.325
Well, what happened to it?

56:39.576 --> 56:41.744
My information is that
ten tons of fertilizer...

56:41.744 --> 56:43.329
was inadvertently
loaded on top of your box...

56:43.413 --> 56:45.957
while it was in the hold. If I was
you I'd sue the shipping company.

56:46.040 --> 56:49.419
Sue? I haven't got time to waste
my bloomin' life suing anybody.

56:49.419 --> 56:51.671
Get some of your blokes to pull...

56:51.671 --> 56:54.048
this right side up so
we can get into the motorcycle...

56:54.048 --> 56:56.426
and see what damage
has been done.

56:57.844 --> 56:59.804
Alright, fellows,
lets get it unwrapped.

57:03.725 --> 57:05.059
The tail looks alright.

57:10.189 --> 57:12.025
No damage so far.

57:13.818 --> 57:15.445
Oh no damage at all.

57:15.778 --> 57:16.779
Good.

57:16.988 --> 57:19.949
- Lucky it was packed so well.
- Yes, its a blimmin' miracle.

57:22.076 --> 57:25.747
Well, the old Indian lives
to fight another day.

57:32.795 --> 57:34.380
Well, thanks a million, Tina.

57:34.464 --> 57:36.966
I don't know what I would have done
without you today...

57:36.966 --> 57:38.634
you're the real salt of the earth,
you know?

57:39.052 --> 57:41.804
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to come home for dinner tonight?

57:41.888 --> 57:43.598
- I can't, love.
- I could cook you a meal.

57:43.681 --> 57:46.309
I've got to get this show on the road,
get out of Dodge as they say.

57:46.893 --> 57:49.062
Okay, my good friend
from Kiwi land.

57:49.270 --> 57:51.272
- You stay in touch, won't you?
- I will.

57:51.773 --> 57:53.149
Here's my phone number.

57:53.566 --> 57:56.152
- Call me and tell me how you're doing.
- I will. Can I call collect?

57:56.819 --> 57:58.029
You can try.

58:04.535 --> 58:07.413
- Its a good job I think you're a woman.
- I am a woman.

58:07.622 --> 58:10.041
Yeah, right. Ta ra love, see ya.

58:37.902 --> 58:39.362
- Morning.
- Morning.

58:41.781 --> 58:43.366
Fill her up, would you please?

58:43.449 --> 58:44.825
Regular or Ethol?

58:45.993 --> 58:47.370
Who's Ethol?

58:48.120 --> 58:49.622
Alright...

58:50.247 --> 58:51.540
I'll take Ethol.

58:57.671 --> 58:59.548
- Hello, young fella.
- Hello.

58:59.757 --> 59:02.259
- Is this a rocket ship?
- What?

59:02.468 --> 59:04.053
Is this a rocket ship?

59:04.678 --> 59:05.846
I hope so.

59:45.469 --> 59:46.553
Oh Gosh.

59:53.394 --> 59:55.020
Whats happened to you?

59:59.942 --> 01:00:00.985
Oh well.

01:00:04.613 --> 01:00:06.156
Lets have a look at ya.

01:00:22.506 --> 01:00:23.799
Got ya!

01:00:26.468 --> 01:00:27.678
Come on!

01:00:38.981 --> 01:00:41.191
I thought we were going
to make it you and me...

01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:43.819
and now look whats happened.

01:01:36.913 --> 01:01:38.832
- Hello, mate.
- Got a problem?

01:01:39.082 --> 01:01:40.917
Yeah. Am I glad to see you.

01:01:41.209 --> 01:01:45.088
Yeah, I've lost a wheel, help me get
my rig back on the road, will you?

01:01:45.297 --> 01:01:46.715
Okay, I'll see.

01:01:47.382 --> 01:01:49.468
My name's Burt, Burt Munro.

01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:51.595
Jake.

01:01:51.887 --> 01:01:53.513
- You Indian?
- Yes.

01:01:54.472 --> 01:01:57.517
Well, this here could be
the worlďs fastest Indian.

01:01:57.601 --> 01:01:59.269
Well, at least until just now.

01:01:59.519 --> 01:02:01.146
She's a bit heavy mind you.

01:02:01.354 --> 01:02:03.940
So lets take it easy,
one, two, three.

01:02:05.692 --> 01:02:07.319
Right.
You live around here, Jake?

01:02:24.628 --> 01:02:27.255
What do you want to ride
that contraption for?

01:02:27.797 --> 01:02:29.299
Thats a good question.

01:02:31.343 --> 01:02:35.180
Well, I guess the reward
is in the doing of it.

01:02:37.098 --> 01:02:40.101
Jake, I'm dying for a pee.
Where do I go?

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:42.228
There's a little building
right there.

01:02:42.395 --> 01:02:44.856
I've got a touch of prostrate
trouble now.

01:02:45.148 --> 01:02:46.775
I have similar problems.

01:02:47.484 --> 01:02:49.444
I thought you blokes would have...

01:02:49.444 --> 01:02:51.404
some magic cures
for that sort of thing.

01:02:51.613 --> 01:02:52.947
Well, we have.

01:02:53.531 --> 01:02:56.868
One old remedy is ground up
dog balls...

01:02:57.076 --> 01:03:00.371
- but I prefer prostrate trouble.
- Yeah, I bet you do, mate.

01:03:03.875 --> 01:03:05.084
I got you!

01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:09.964
Jake, gotta get going,
gotta hit the road.

01:03:10.215 --> 01:03:12.800
- Burt, I have something for you.
- Whats that then?

01:03:14.427 --> 01:03:15.845
Whats this?

01:03:16.262 --> 01:03:18.348
- For good luck.
- Oh yeah?

01:03:18.514 --> 01:03:22.143
I've never worn jewellery before.
Thanks, mate.

01:03:22.268 --> 01:03:24.604
I've got something for you too,
hang on about.

01:03:26.314 --> 01:03:27.440
Right...

01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:29.108
lets see.

01:03:33.154 --> 01:03:35.698
I've got this, its a spare one,
I made it myself.

01:03:36.491 --> 01:03:39.077
- What do I do with this?
- You got a hacksaw?

01:03:39.285 --> 01:03:41.704
Just slice the top of it,
through where the gudgeon pin goes...

01:03:41.704 --> 01:03:43.122
and itll make a great ash tray.

01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:45.166
Not that I approve of smoking,
mind you.

01:03:45.291 --> 01:03:47.293
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot, mate. So long.

01:03:47.293 --> 01:03:50.588
- Sorry we couldn't fix your trailer.
- Thats alright, I'll get there somehow.

01:03:51.172 --> 01:03:52.298
Burt?

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:53.841
What?

01:03:54.133 --> 01:03:55.468
For the prostrate.

01:03:55.885 --> 01:03:57.678
Use with water,
plenty of water.

01:03:58.346 --> 01:04:00.139
It tastes bad. Really bad.

01:04:00.348 --> 01:04:01.849
Dogs balls huh?

01:04:02.308 --> 01:04:04.519
Well, thanks a lot mate.
See ya.

01:05:06.343 --> 01:05:07.303
Hello.

01:05:11.098 --> 01:05:12.433
Anyone home?

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:21.650
Hello.

01:05:21.734 --> 01:05:23.027
Hello, there.

01:05:25.905 --> 01:05:29.200
I've got a spot of bother
with my trailer, lost a wheel.

01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:33.954
- You're not from around these parts.
- No, I'm from down there.

01:05:34.747 --> 01:05:37.124
- What?
- I'm from down under...

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:39.627
The other side of the world,
New Zealand.

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.587
Southern most city
in the British Empire.

01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:43.380
Called Invercargill.

01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:45.883
One of the most beautiful
cities on Earth.

01:05:46.508 --> 01:05:48.010
Name's Burt Munro.

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.637
Burt? Ada.

01:05:49.887 --> 01:05:51.138
- What?
- Ada.

01:05:52.723 --> 01:05:53.849
There she is.

01:06:00.522 --> 01:06:02.691
We got some problems here,
yes sirree.

01:06:03.734 --> 01:06:05.653
I tell you what you need to do.

01:06:05.736 --> 01:06:09.281
Cannibalize the stuffed axel
out of that old Ford right there.

01:06:09.531 --> 01:06:11.450
Lucky for you
I've got some welding gear.

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:13.702
- We'll get a new wheel on there pronto.
- Good.

01:06:23.295 --> 01:06:24.588
Thats got it.

01:06:26.256 --> 01:06:27.633
When you are...

01:06:28.717 --> 01:06:29.802
finished there...

01:06:30.469 --> 01:06:32.888
I've got something that
I want to show you.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:34.723
Yeah, whats that?

01:06:36.809 --> 01:06:38.268
Never you mind.

01:06:38.519 --> 01:06:40.229
You just get that wheel on
there right.

01:06:53.492 --> 01:06:55.160
Why'd you bring me out here?

01:06:55.369 --> 01:06:57.746
I want to show you this.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.539
What?

01:06:59.623 --> 01:07:00.791
Right here.

01:07:07.381 --> 01:07:11.635
I laid my old boy to rest
twelve years ago next week.

01:07:11.843 --> 01:07:13.428
I sure miss him.

01:07:13.637 --> 01:07:15.722
I sure do miss the old boy.

01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:18.392
He did his level best.

01:07:19.685 --> 01:07:20.977
He did.

01:07:21.395 --> 01:07:23.522
I always figured a man's
like a blade of grass...

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.316
he grows up in the spring,
strong and healthy and green...

01:07:26.566 --> 01:07:31.196
and then he reaches middle age
and he ripens as it were and...

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.283
in the autumn they,
like a blade of grass...

01:07:35.534 --> 01:07:38.829
he finishes just fades away
and he never comes back.

01:07:39.413 --> 01:07:41.415
Just like a blade of grass.

01:07:41.706 --> 01:07:44.459
I think when you're dead,
you're dead.

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:47.796
I've always thought that,
since I grew up.

01:07:48.046 --> 01:07:50.257
Is that your philosophy?

01:07:50.507 --> 01:07:51.925
Well, I don't know,
yeah, I suppose it is...

01:07:52.008 --> 01:07:56.847
when you get to my age these
thoughts cross your mind sometimes.

01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:59.683
Jump!

01:08:00.392 --> 01:08:01.768
Jump!

01:08:02.310 --> 01:08:04.688
Sideways, you fool,
sideways!

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.191
My God, man, haven't you ever
seen a snake before?

01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:10.026
No, we don't get snakes
in New Zealand.

01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:12.237
Good God,
I ought to move there.

01:08:13.196 --> 01:08:14.823
- Where's he going?
- Damn rattlers!

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:18.368
- Any more around here? Oh, God.
- Fancy this?

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:23.163
You come all this way
to bite the dust up at Boot Hill?

01:08:24.957 --> 01:08:27.377
That would be a laugh,
wouldn't it?

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:29.045
Be a laugh.

01:08:29.296 --> 01:08:30.462
There you go, there you go.

01:08:32.006 --> 01:08:33.049
Oh, my God!

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.599
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.270
I don't know, I've no idea.

01:08:48.022 --> 01:08:48.982
I don't know.

01:09:09.127 --> 01:09:11.296
I had a strange dream
last night.

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:15.383
I dreamt about my late...

01:09:16.676 --> 01:09:19.136
twin brother, Ernie.

01:09:21.014 --> 01:09:24.475
I thought he was in the room here
looking down on us.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.231
I guess its all
that fun and games...

01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:32.274
at the graveyard.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:36.571
I suppose.

01:09:36.863 --> 01:09:37.863
Oh, well.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.618
Getting old ain't for the faint
of heart I'll tell you that.

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:45.287
Oh, God. What have you done
to my back, Ada?

01:09:49.042 --> 01:09:50.501
I am getting old.

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.882
Come on old girl, make me a cup of tea,
I've got to hit the road.

01:09:56.591 --> 01:09:59.886
Ada, come on, you haven't died
in our sleep, have you, old girl?

01:10:00.136 --> 01:10:03.181
- Make me a cup of tea.
- Come here, lover boy.

01:10:03.806 --> 01:10:05.349
I'll make it myself.

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:07.143
Thanks.

01:10:11.147 --> 01:10:14.233
Now Burt, you promise me you're going
to pop in on your way back...

01:10:14.484 --> 01:10:17.361
because I can always use
another little cuddle.

01:10:17.403 --> 01:10:19.822
Yeah, thats what I said, Ada,
thats what I intend to do.

01:10:20.072 --> 01:10:23.201
There's many good tune played on
an old Banjo as they say.

01:10:23.576 --> 01:10:27.205
- And what we don't use, we lose.
- Well, thats what they say.

01:10:28.122 --> 01:10:29.415
See ya. Ta ra, darling.

01:10:29.957 --> 01:10:33.711
And you have good luck
with your Indian.

01:10:33.961 --> 01:10:35.796
You should say
break a leg.

01:10:37.465 --> 01:10:38.591
See ya.

01:10:58.778 --> 01:10:59.737
Gidday.

01:11:00.237 --> 01:11:01.739
Boy is it hot out there.

01:11:03.616 --> 01:11:05.326
I bet the birds fly backwards
around here...

01:11:05.409 --> 01:11:07.828
to keep the dust out
of their eyes.

01:11:08.079 --> 01:11:11.624
- What can I get you?
- I'd like a cup of tea, please.

01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:13.751
- Cup of tea?
- Yeah, best drink...

01:11:13.793 --> 01:11:16.670
for quenching the thirst
when the weather's hot.

01:11:17.088 --> 01:11:19.590
We haven't seen a cup of tea
in here ever.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.719
We got Coors, we got Schlitz
or Miller or Coke and whiskey.

01:11:25.971 --> 01:11:28.099
Well, I'll have coke then.

01:11:32.603 --> 01:11:35.189
You know smoking's bad for you,
don't you?

01:11:35.898 --> 01:11:37.733
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

01:11:37.942 --> 01:11:40.319
Personally I don't smoke
and I don't drink.

01:11:40.528 --> 01:11:42.738
I had the right education
from my dad on that one.

01:11:42.988 --> 01:11:46.867
He was like King James the first,
great anti-smoking man.

01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:50.120
Sounds like you're on a one
man crusade there grandpa.

01:11:50.412 --> 01:11:53.749
Yeah, well, you're born with one
pair of lungs so why destroy...

01:11:53.749 --> 01:11:55.376
them with that muck?

01:11:56.377 --> 01:11:58.003
Where are you from?
Where's your home town?

01:11:58.462 --> 01:12:00.464
- You English?
- Heavens no...

01:12:00.673 --> 01:12:03.509
I'm no Pommie,
I'm from Invercargill in New Zealand.

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:05.970
- Where?
- Invercargill.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.932
L-N-V-E-R-C-A-R-G-l-L-L.

01:12:10.182 --> 01:12:14.103
I spell it with one L
sometimes to save ink.

01:12:17.147 --> 01:12:21.360
- Got any of those critters over there?
- Oh yes, much bigger though...

01:12:21.568 --> 01:12:23.987
we breed them down there
on big farms...

01:12:24.488 --> 01:12:27.491
and we cut off their antlers and
send them over to Hong Kong and they...

01:12:27.574 --> 01:12:31.161
grind the antlers into dust
and they eat that stuff...

01:12:32.121 --> 01:12:35.207
must be some sort of aphrodisiac
or something.

01:12:35.999 --> 01:12:37.793
Puts lead in your pencil.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.088
You could do with some
of that, Leroy.

01:12:44.049 --> 01:12:45.676
Your girlfriend?

01:12:46.218 --> 01:12:47.261
Wife.

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:50.389
Oh, dear!

01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:57.563
You alright?

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.683
Did you decide to leave Jackie
a tip after all?

01:13:39.146 --> 01:13:42.024
Look sir, if you're not feeling well
you should drop in to the hospital...

01:13:42.024 --> 01:13:43.275
in the next town.

01:13:44.234 --> 01:13:45.444
Alright.

01:14:23.648 --> 01:14:25.191
Roll down your window.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.568
What?

01:14:31.114 --> 01:14:32.324
Whats the problem?

01:14:32.574 --> 01:14:34.492
You're parked illegally.

01:14:34.951 --> 01:14:37.954
- You're a danger to the passing traffic.
- Am I?

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.124
- Lets see your driver's license.
- Yeah, alright.

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:44.878
Here you are.

01:14:51.968 --> 01:14:54.054
- Where are you from?
- From New Zealand.

01:14:54.387 --> 01:14:58.266
Thats the land of the
long white cloud. Aotearoa.

01:14:58.683 --> 01:15:00.268
Home of the kiwi bird.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.646
Well, I don't care if you're from Mars,
you cannot stop here.

01:15:04.105 --> 01:15:05.023
Alright.

01:15:05.023 --> 01:15:08.777
You cannot stop on the side of this road,
you're parked illegally.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.364
Okay, well, sorry, I was having
a bit of a heart attack and...

01:15:13.823 --> 01:15:15.784
well recovering
from one anyway.

01:15:16.034 --> 01:15:18.411
Yeah, well, next time,
how about we stop at a proper rest area.

01:15:18.703 --> 01:15:20.079
Yeah, alright, okay.

01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:23.500
Name's Burt Munro.
Sorry about that.

01:15:30.882 --> 01:15:32.383
Oil's OK.

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:34.135
- Thank you.
- Thats alright, sir.

01:15:34.636 --> 01:15:35.720
Excuse me.

01:15:36.095 --> 01:15:37.388
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

01:15:37.472 --> 01:15:40.808
Listen, I was wondering
if I could catch a ride?

01:15:41.059 --> 01:15:44.979
My car, she just broke down and I'm
really trying to get to Salt Lake City.

01:15:45.438 --> 01:15:48.191
I'm only going as far as Wendover,
thats where I'm stopping.

01:15:48.399 --> 01:15:50.485
Well, anything would be
better than nothing.

01:15:50.485 --> 01:15:53.571
- Ain't that the truth? Hop in, mate.
- Hey, thank you.

01:15:55.448 --> 01:15:58.034
I'm going to go see
my girlfriend...

01:15:58.284 --> 01:16:00.495
she just moved from LA
to Salt Lake, so.

01:16:01.496 --> 01:16:03.665
I'm home on leave from 'Nam.

01:16:03.915 --> 01:16:05.333
- What?
- Vietnam?

01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:06.709
Oh, yeah.

01:16:07.293 --> 01:16:09.879
Hey, what is that you've
got strapped on back there?

01:16:10.254 --> 01:16:13.508
That, young fellow,
is an Indian.

01:16:15.051 --> 01:16:16.094
Motorcycle.

01:16:17.261 --> 01:16:19.097
So what are you doing
in Vietnam?

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.099
I'm involved
in operation ranch hand.

01:16:21.349 --> 01:16:23.810
Oh, whats that?
Farming or something?

01:16:24.227 --> 01:16:27.105
No, not exactly,
we just started this program...

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.150
we are spraying the jungle
from the air with herbicides...

01:16:31.317 --> 01:16:34.570
so the enemy, the Vietcong,
don't have any place to hide.

01:16:34.987 --> 01:16:39.200
Agent Orange we call this stuff,
it comes in these big old orange drums.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.037
How is it working out?

01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:48.251
Well, I'm home on two months leave
and I've got to get my arse back there.

01:16:48.501 --> 01:16:52.547
We should have this war done in 6 months
or so, thats what they keep telling us.

01:16:52.713 --> 01:16:55.174
Can't wait to get my arse out of there
to tell you the truth.

01:16:55.424 --> 01:16:58.928
Yeah, I remember
the Great War in 1914...

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:03.599
I was about your age and
thats what they kept telling everyone.

01:17:04.433 --> 01:17:06.394
Soon be over.

01:17:06.644 --> 01:17:09.730
20 million dead and four years later
it was still going on.

01:17:10.898 --> 01:17:13.359
Not as bad
as the big flu epidemic though.

01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:17.029
Killed 21 million, that did.
Maybe more.

01:17:17.947 --> 01:17:19.865
Every day,
when I left to go to work...

01:17:19.949 --> 01:17:23.244
my mum would spray some formalin
on my shirt...

01:17:24.328 --> 01:17:26.956
and maybe thats why
I didn't catch it.

01:17:27.581 --> 01:17:30.209
Or maybe I was just lucky.
You never know.

01:17:32.503 --> 01:17:34.422
- Knock on wood.
- Yep.

01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:38.384
You know,
life's a funny thing...

01:17:38.384 --> 01:17:40.636
you never know
whats around the corner, do you?

01:17:43.013 --> 01:17:44.515
Your shaving brush.

01:17:45.516 --> 01:17:46.767
Has had its day.

01:17:47.143 --> 01:17:49.019
It won't achieve.

01:17:49.895 --> 01:17:51.480
The Modern way.

01:17:53.399 --> 01:17:55.109
Burma Shave.

01:17:56.986 --> 01:18:00.197
"She doesn't kiss ya
like she used to?

01:18:00.531 --> 01:18:03.701
Has she seen
some smoother rooster?

01:18:04.618 --> 01:18:06.203
Burma Shave.

01:18:06.704 --> 01:18:09.832
These signs we dedicate...

01:18:10.457 --> 01:18:11.625
to men...

01:18:11.876 --> 01:18:14.670
who've had no date of late.

01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:16.714
Burma Shave".

01:18:17.381 --> 01:18:20.217
Yeah, thats us.
Well, you anyway.

01:18:26.765 --> 01:18:28.309
Look at that.

01:18:28.767 --> 01:18:30.936
Thats a cowboy and a half.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:35.607
I was thinking I'd come out
to the Salt with you.

01:18:35.691 --> 01:18:37.651
I'd like to be there
the first time you see it...

01:18:37.651 --> 01:18:39.445
its only a couple of miles
up the road so.

01:18:39.445 --> 01:18:41.363
Yeah, alright then,
that sounds good.

01:18:41.655 --> 01:18:44.199
Looks like there's a lot of people
in town for speed week, huh?

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:45.826
Yeah, looks like it.

01:18:48.704 --> 01:18:51.957
This is it, Burt.
We're gonna take a left right up here.

01:19:04.303 --> 01:19:05.721
Bonneville...

01:19:06.305 --> 01:19:07.806
I mean I can't believe it.

01:19:08.056 --> 01:19:10.350
I mean I'm here, I've made it.

01:19:11.768 --> 01:19:13.020
I've made it.

01:19:41.089 --> 01:19:43.967
You know, all my life
I wanted to do something big.

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:47.512
Something better and bigger
than all the other jokers.

01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:50.932
This is it, Bonneville.

01:19:52.142 --> 01:19:55.854
This is the place
where big things happen.

01:19:59.358 --> 01:20:03.111
Do you realize, Rusty, the fastest
man has ever gone on land is here?

01:20:04.404 --> 01:20:06.073
Right here, where we are now.

01:20:09.618 --> 01:20:13.038
Malcolm Campbell did it here,
with a Bluebird.

01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:16.041
First guy to go
over 300 mile an hour...

01:20:16.124 --> 01:20:19.169
and then later his son, Donald Campbell
was here with Proteus.

01:20:19.294 --> 01:20:23.089
He crashed at 350 mile an hour
and lived to tell the tale.

01:20:24.966 --> 01:20:26.468
John Cobb was here.

01:20:27.552 --> 01:20:30.514
First guy
to go over 400 mile an hour.

01:20:31.556 --> 01:20:33.558
All the great attempts.

01:20:34.059 --> 01:20:36.811
George Easton with Thunderbolt and...

01:20:37.312 --> 01:20:40.315
Mickey Thompson
with Challenger.

01:20:43.693 --> 01:20:46.404
I'm telling you, Rusty,
this place is holy ground, mate.

01:20:47.781 --> 01:20:48.990
Holy ground.

01:20:50.408 --> 01:20:52.577
And I made it here.

01:21:21.856 --> 01:21:23.024
Well, Burt.

01:21:23.608 --> 01:21:24.776
Thanks a million.

01:21:25.026 --> 01:21:26.403
I'll be looking for you
in the record books.

01:21:26.444 --> 01:21:28.905
You take care out there in Vietnam,
won't you?

01:21:28.905 --> 01:21:29.864
I'll be trying.

01:21:30.406 --> 01:21:31.658
- Okay, mate.
- Drive safe.

01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:33.451
- See ya
- See ya.

01:22:51.404 --> 01:22:52.447
God.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.976
Jesus.

01:23:54.717 --> 01:23:56.385
- Gidday.
- Hey, there.

01:23:59.388 --> 01:24:01.223
- Its going to be a great day.
- Yeah.

01:24:01.807 --> 01:24:04.226
Still... no wind.

01:24:04.977 --> 01:24:06.562
Lovely day for a run.

01:24:08.397 --> 01:24:10.024
Salts in good shape.

01:24:10.024 --> 01:24:11.817
Yeah. Firm and dry.

01:24:12.193 --> 01:24:14.403
Dead flat. No soft patches.

01:24:14.987 --> 01:24:16.614
Not like the beach.

01:24:17.781 --> 01:24:19.617
I can do it here.

01:24:20.284 --> 01:24:21.368
Yep.

01:24:21.994 --> 01:24:24.288
This week.
Its what we're here for.

01:24:29.001 --> 01:24:30.085
Wow, is that yours?

01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:32.046
Yep.

01:24:32.963 --> 01:24:34.715
Gosh, she's a beauty.

01:24:35.716 --> 01:24:37.718
I bet she goes fast.

01:24:38.636 --> 01:24:41.013
- That yours?
- Yeah, thats an old Indian.

01:24:41.805 --> 01:24:43.557
My name's Munro, Burt Munro.

01:24:43.766 --> 01:24:46.644
- From down under, New Zealand.
- A long way from home.

01:24:46.894 --> 01:24:49.396
Jim Moffatt, San Jose,
California.

01:24:49.605 --> 01:24:51.357
- Nice to meet you, Burt.
- Good to meet you, Jim.

01:24:51.565 --> 01:24:53.359
<i>Lets get to the start line.</i>

01:24:53.609 --> 01:24:58.280
<i>The race is about to start
and all the racers are excited.</i>

01:24:58.697 --> 01:25:02.618
This car is driven by Jim Moffatt,
San Jose, California.

01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:06.372
The other pilots are...

01:25:16.882 --> 01:25:19.343
- Come on, guys, 15 minutes.
- Come on.

01:25:19.885 --> 01:25:21.512
Come on, lets go.

01:25:30.062 --> 01:25:32.105
- Morning.
- Hello, Burt Munro.

01:25:32.356 --> 01:25:33.732
- Mike.
- Hi, Mike.

01:25:34.775 --> 01:25:37.194
- Are you checked in?
- No, not yet.

01:25:38.153 --> 01:25:41.990
Well, you've got to remove the shell
before we do the tech inspection.

01:25:42.157 --> 01:25:44.451
- Where do I check in?
- Its just over there.

01:25:44.701 --> 01:25:46.578
- Thanks, fellas.
- Okay.

01:25:48.997 --> 01:25:50.165
I gotta see this.

01:25:50.499 --> 01:25:54.086
Hello, I've come to check in.
Munro, Burt Munro.

01:25:54.378 --> 01:25:56.004
Registration number?

01:25:56.755 --> 01:25:57.923
What?

01:25:58.173 --> 01:26:01.093
Registration number.
I don't see your number here.

01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:04.137
No, its number 35.

01:26:04.388 --> 01:26:08.266
Its on the side of my motorcycle
over there, thats my lucky number.

01:26:08.517 --> 01:26:09.851
Have you registered?

01:26:11.478 --> 01:26:13.939
No, thats what
I've come over for.

01:26:13.939 --> 01:26:16.274
These two blokes sent me over here,
Mike and someone else.

01:26:16.525 --> 01:26:18.944
Sir, registration closed
last month.

01:26:19.194 --> 01:26:22.531
If you haven't registered,
I'm sorry, you just can't run.

01:26:25.409 --> 01:26:27.160
I can't run?

01:26:28.578 --> 01:26:31.790
Well, how was I supposed to know
I should have pre-registered?

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:34.292
I've come a heck of a long way
to ride my bike.

01:26:34.292 --> 01:26:36.128
I'm not going anywhere
until I've done just that.

01:26:36.128 --> 01:26:39.089
I've come all the way from New Zealand,
you know. Its a long way.

01:26:39.422 --> 01:26:41.091
Look, mister,
we don't make the rules.

01:26:41.341 --> 01:26:44.761
An event like this doesn't just happen
in one day, rules are rules.

01:26:44.761 --> 01:26:46.763
Entries closed July 31st.

01:26:46.805 --> 01:26:50.517
Well, crikey, I live in Invercargill,
its half way round the bloody earth.

01:26:51.101 --> 01:26:53.770
How was I supposed to know these things?
I didn't know all this stuff.

01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:55.063
Sir, its not our problem.

01:26:55.146 --> 01:26:58.149
I thought I could just turn up here
and have my bike timed.

01:26:58.149 --> 01:27:00.360
- You don't have to call me...
- Well, you thought wrong.

01:27:10.078 --> 01:27:12.122
Jim Moffatt!

01:27:12.664 --> 01:27:14.916
Its Burt, Burt Munro.
Can you come over here, mate?

01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:17.043
I'll be right back.

01:27:17.877 --> 01:27:19.504
I need a bit of help.

01:27:19.796 --> 01:27:21.297
Hey, Burt. Whats up?

01:27:21.673 --> 01:27:25.343
Well, I have these blokes telling
me I can't run my bike...

01:27:25.593 --> 01:27:27.595
because I'm not pre-registered.

01:27:27.846 --> 01:27:30.390
- You didn't register?
- No, I didn't know anything about it.

01:27:30.473 --> 01:27:32.934
You know how it is Jim,
rules are rules.

01:27:33.268 --> 01:27:36.354
- You should have registered months ago.
- I didn't know.

01:27:37.814 --> 01:27:40.316
I'll have a talk with these guys later,
see if I can change their minds.

01:27:40.567 --> 01:27:43.945
- Your blooďs worth bottling.
- I don't know about that.

01:27:44.195 --> 01:27:46.156
Look,
we can talk about this later.

01:27:46.156 --> 01:27:47.949
Maybe you can let him go
through tech inspection.

01:27:48.199 --> 01:27:51.578
Get that out of the way?
Just in case we can let him ride.

01:27:52.412 --> 01:27:54.247
You're asking a lot.

01:27:55.457 --> 01:27:56.541
Alright.

01:28:00.545 --> 01:28:02.088
- Okay.
- Alright.

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.465
- Make me proud.
- Thanks a lot.

01:28:04.716 --> 01:28:06.801
You give me a bit
of a fright there.

01:28:11.556 --> 01:28:14.475
You know these don't look
like high speed tyres.

01:28:14.726 --> 01:28:16.394
Well, they are high speed tyres.

01:28:17.186 --> 01:28:20.481
Look at these hairline cracks,
these tyres have got to be 25 years old.

01:28:20.857 --> 01:28:22.567
- What happened to the tread?
- What?

01:28:22.775 --> 01:28:24.819
I said,
what happened to the tread?

01:28:24.819 --> 01:28:26.237
Well, I cut it off,
thats what happened to the tread...

01:28:26.321 --> 01:28:27.739
I cut it off with a carving knife...

01:28:27.739 --> 01:28:30.116
otherwise it wouldn't be
a high speed tyre, would it?

01:28:30.533 --> 01:28:31.993
What are you talking about?

01:28:31.993 --> 01:28:35.204
Well, you've got to keep the weight in
otherwise when you get to a high speed...

01:28:35.204 --> 01:28:37.498
the centrifugal force will
the tread right off, wouldn't it?

01:28:37.832 --> 01:28:41.753
I run them on 65 pounds of air and
that tyre's safe up to 300 miles an hour.

01:28:41.961 --> 01:28:44.339
I guarantee it. These are high
speed tyres and I made them.

01:28:44.589 --> 01:28:46.466
Well, you're going to have
to replace them.

01:28:46.716 --> 01:28:48.342
The suspension here is
a leaf spring...

01:28:48.634 --> 01:28:49.802
I mean can we pass that?

01:28:50.094 --> 01:28:53.056
Geez, last leaf spring on a motorcycle
must have been in the 1920s.

01:28:53.347 --> 01:28:54.682
Well, it is 42 years old.

01:28:54.932 --> 01:28:58.853
- These brakes look completely inadequate.
- Well, I'm planning on going, not stopping.

01:28:58.936 --> 01:29:01.898
Well, the brakes were old
fashioned 40 years ago.

01:29:02.565 --> 01:29:04.358
Is this a hinge of a gate post?

01:29:04.567 --> 01:29:06.694
No, thats from an old kitchen door.

01:29:08.571 --> 01:29:12.241
Let me just ask you what is this?

01:29:12.492 --> 01:29:15.453
Its a cork, what does it look like?
Its a cork from a brandy bottle.

01:29:15.661 --> 01:29:20.041
You know, the thing is its all about
weight. The less weight, the faster you go.

01:29:20.124 --> 01:29:21.250
And where's your chute?

01:29:21.501 --> 01:29:23.377
- What?
- Where's your parachute?

01:29:23.502 --> 01:29:25.379
I'm not planning on bailing out.

01:29:25.463 --> 01:29:27.840
No wait,
you've got to have a safety chute.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.342
Well, I can't afford one.

01:29:29.342 --> 01:29:32.011
These forks, if they give out we've
got ourselves some real problems.

01:29:32.261 --> 01:29:34.555
I think I'd have a bit of
a problem that way, wouldn't I?

01:29:35.264 --> 01:29:36.766
- Where's your fire suit?
- What?

01:29:37.016 --> 01:29:38.476
Where's your fire suit?

01:29:38.476 --> 01:29:40.811
Good heavens, man,
I don't intend to burst into flames.

01:29:41.062 --> 01:29:43.814
Always wear me old suit pants
for good luck.

01:29:43.814 --> 01:29:45.399
If they were good enough
to get married in...

01:29:45.399 --> 01:29:47.693
they're good enough to ride
this old girl in and no...

01:29:47.943 --> 01:29:50.029
I tuck the legs of my pants
into my socks like this...

01:29:50.237 --> 01:29:53.407
stop them getting caught
in the chain and Bob's your uncle.

01:29:53.783 --> 01:29:56.077
You've got your suit pants,
what are you gonna wear on top?

01:29:56.077 --> 01:29:56.869
What?

01:29:56.952 --> 01:29:59.914
You've got your suit pants,
what do you intend to wear on top?

01:30:00.122 --> 01:30:04.543
Yes, a black woolen shirt, New Zealand
wool, water resistant, fire resistant...

01:30:04.668 --> 01:30:06.295
and me bash hat.

01:30:07.004 --> 01:30:08.464
Bash hat?

01:30:09.131 --> 01:30:10.132
Yeah, crash helmet.

01:30:10.132 --> 01:30:13.636
You're crazy, you've got to wear
at least a leather jacket on top.

01:30:13.636 --> 01:30:16.764
You put the bike down on the salt,
its like coarse sand paper...

01:30:16.764 --> 01:30:18.182
its going to rub
your head right off.

01:30:18.182 --> 01:30:19.975
I couldn't get into the shell...

01:30:19.975 --> 01:30:23.020
with anything bulkier than the shirt on
my back. Its a very tight fit in there.

01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:24.396
Straight out of the ark.

01:30:25.481 --> 01:30:27.441
- What did you say?
- Straight out of the ark.

01:30:27.691 --> 01:30:30.528
Don't be so cheeky.
Whats your name, young man?

01:30:31.153 --> 01:30:33.072
McFarlane. Mike McFarlane.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.325
I knew a McFarlane, he used to sell
milking machines in Timaru.

01:30:36.575 --> 01:30:38.953
You must be related to him
because he was a total prick.

01:30:40.204 --> 01:30:42.248
Look here, you don't even have
a fire extinguisher installed.

01:30:42.414 --> 01:30:47.044
Mike McFarlane used to give me milking
machine parts to make my sprockets with.

01:30:47.127 --> 01:30:48.212
How old are you?

01:30:48.212 --> 01:30:49.922
I don't know,
he was about 35 when I knew him.

01:30:50.130 --> 01:30:51.382
No how old are you?

01:30:51.382 --> 01:30:54.802
His brother owned a general store
down in a place called Bulls...

01:30:55.052 --> 01:30:57.680
- thats a town in New Zealand.
- Sir, your machine is not safe.

01:30:58.013 --> 01:31:00.891
I've been doing this for 43 years
and I'm still here to tell the tale.

01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:04.228
Time's change, we started taking
airplanes instead of riding horseback.

01:31:04.436 --> 01:31:06.313
- Horse power?
- Horse back. Horse back.

01:31:06.355 --> 01:31:07.690
Horse back, yeah.
I got you, yeah.

01:31:08.649 --> 01:31:09.984
You're too old.

01:31:10.359 --> 01:31:13.278
Bollocks. I may have this saggy skin
on the outside...

01:31:13.278 --> 01:31:14.738
but on the inside
I'm still 18 years old...

01:31:14.988 --> 01:31:16.949
and I'll give you a run for your money,
young fella.

01:31:18.492 --> 01:31:20.035
You need some help?

01:31:20.327 --> 01:31:21.453
Hello.

01:31:22.579 --> 01:31:25.457
Rollie Free, Marty Dickerson,
we're a couple of bike fans.

01:31:25.749 --> 01:31:28.669
- Burt Munro from Kiwi land.
- Pleasure, Burt.

01:31:31.046 --> 01:31:32.881
You got me good there.

01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:34.508
Where are you staying?

01:31:34.716 --> 01:31:36.760
Thats my salubrious
accommodation...

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.971
I usually sleep at night
in the back seat.

01:31:39.221 --> 01:31:40.889
Salubrious you say Munro, huh?

01:31:42.015 --> 01:31:43.809
We've been hearing a lot about you.

01:31:44.101 --> 01:31:46.186
Sounds like you're cutting
your finances mighty fine.

01:31:46.436 --> 01:31:47.938
Yeah, you could say that again.

01:31:48.188 --> 01:31:50.315
We'll we're up at the Western Ridge,
why don't you drop by...

01:31:50.566 --> 01:31:52.568
it looks as though you could
use a good shower...

01:31:52.651 --> 01:31:55.696
and everybody's staying there and
I bet that there's a spare bed there too.

01:31:55.946 --> 01:31:58.365
Thanks a lot, you yanks
are classic you know that?

01:31:58.574 --> 01:32:00.450
You don't catch me that easily.

01:32:06.456 --> 01:32:07.791
Hey, Burt.

01:32:08.083 --> 01:32:09.209
Hello.

01:32:11.336 --> 01:32:13.297
The front forks could
go at any time...

01:32:13.338 --> 01:32:15.674
the suspension is right out
of the 1920s.

01:32:15.882 --> 01:32:18.135
Got hairline cracks all
over his tyres...

01:32:18.218 --> 01:32:21.179
he's got no fire extinguisher,
no safety chute.

01:32:21.388 --> 01:32:24.766
I told you, if its a time problem, the
old guy's welcome to use some of my time.

01:32:24.975 --> 01:32:27.269
Its not a time problem,
its a bike problem.

01:32:27.519 --> 01:32:28.979
Well, I think we ought
to let him run.

01:32:29.563 --> 01:32:31.523
He came all the way from
New Zealand to do this.

01:32:31.773 --> 01:32:34.234
Jim, have you had a good look
at his machine?

01:32:34.359 --> 01:32:36.194
All I know is the man's
the genuine article.

01:32:36.445 --> 01:32:38.447
Yeah, but the bike is
the genuine dinosaur.

01:32:38.739 --> 01:32:41.616
Look, we carry the cans
for the decisions around here.

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:44.661
And if he kills himself and there's
about a 100 to 1 that he will.

01:32:44.661 --> 01:32:47.372
Are gonna have a hell
of a lot of trouble on our hands.

01:32:47.456 --> 01:32:52.169
Yeah, sounds like we're a bunch
of chicken shits if you want my opinion.

01:32:52.294 --> 01:32:55.964
His bike didn't even come close
to passing tech inspection, Jim.

01:33:05.724 --> 01:33:06.474
Burt.

01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:08.768
Hello, Jim. Come in.

01:33:09.394 --> 01:33:11.229
Rollie Free said
I could find you here.

01:33:11.271 --> 01:33:14.232
Rollie Free, he's the best,
he's a real gentleman.

01:33:14.482 --> 01:33:16.902
He set me up in this place
for nothing.

01:33:20.322 --> 01:33:21.448
What are you doing?

01:33:21.948 --> 01:33:25.327
Well, the soft shoe polish
fills in the cracks makes the tyres...

01:33:25.577 --> 01:33:27.746
Iook spick and span,
good as new.

01:33:27.996 --> 01:33:29.497
Cheaper than new ones anyway.

01:33:29.789 --> 01:33:30.915
I didn't see that.

01:33:33.627 --> 01:33:35.629
Well? Can I run?

01:33:38.506 --> 01:33:39.716
I'm sorry, Burt.

01:33:46.973 --> 01:33:49.017
Who the heck
do they think they are?

01:33:49.893 --> 01:33:53.354
Crikey Jim, you know, I'm not trying
to run a mile in four minutes...

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.274
all I've got to do is sit there
and open up the throttle...

01:33:56.316 --> 01:33:59.778
I mean, after all
its my ruddy life, isn't it?

01:34:00.779 --> 01:34:02.363
Can't you do anything?

01:34:02.363 --> 01:34:06.951
I mean, I just want to try and get her
to go over 200 just once thats all...

01:34:07.035 --> 01:34:08.995
once I've cracked 200
I'll be quite happy...

01:34:08.995 --> 01:34:11.581
to piss off back home to New Zealand
and Bob's your uncle.

01:34:12.207 --> 01:34:16.169
You're a well respected man around here,
can you talk to them?

01:34:16.461 --> 01:34:17.629
I tried.

01:34:18.463 --> 01:34:21.424
You've got as much chance
of writing yourself off as I have...

01:34:21.424 --> 01:34:24.260
you know that.
Just talk to them again.

01:34:25.511 --> 01:34:27.722
I know they'll listen to you, mate.

01:34:30.141 --> 01:34:32.936
Okay Burt, I'll try.
See you tomorrow.

01:34:33.228 --> 01:34:34.312
Okay.

01:34:37.482 --> 01:34:41.194
I mean I'm half the age of some
of those characters out there.

01:34:47.033 --> 01:34:48.451
Whats that?

01:34:48.743 --> 01:34:50.453
Thats just indigestion.

01:34:56.167 --> 01:35:01.047
Everyone wants us old buggers
to curl up in some quiet corner and die.

01:35:02.006 --> 01:35:05.802
Well, Burt Munro's not ready to finish
yet, I'll tell you that, mate.

01:35:08.429 --> 01:35:10.848
I'll give it a shot
but I'm not promising anything.

01:35:11.557 --> 01:35:13.434
Thanks, mate.
Thanks a lot.

01:35:18.815 --> 01:35:21.776
<i>The famous Challenger One...</i>

01:35:31.744 --> 01:35:33.496
What is he doing?

01:35:33.746 --> 01:35:36.123
- Didn't Jim tell him?
- He says he did.

01:35:36.666 --> 01:35:39.418
- Well, then whats he doing here?
- Why won't you let him run?

01:35:39.502 --> 01:35:42.004
Hey, he's too old
and his bike's too old.

01:35:42.296 --> 01:35:44.465
He's come half way round the world
to ride that cycle.

01:35:44.757 --> 01:35:45.925
Yeah, come on.

01:35:46.259 --> 01:35:50.221
- Wendy, if he was to kill himself.
- So? Its his life.

01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.848
Keep an eye out
for those officials.

01:35:52.932 --> 01:35:55.518
You sure you want to do this?
I'm not sure its a good idea.

01:35:55.601 --> 01:35:58.271
Hurry up. If we're going to do
this thing you've got to hurry.

01:35:58.354 --> 01:36:00.314
Alright, lets go,
here's your helmet.

01:36:02.316 --> 01:36:03.651
Here's your goggles.

01:36:03.985 --> 01:36:05.903
- Come on, Burt. We've got to go.
- Yeah, right.

01:36:05.987 --> 01:36:07.530
Come on, put them on.

01:36:12.326 --> 01:36:13.536
Go, go, come on.

01:36:17.873 --> 01:36:19.166
Okay, lets go, push.

01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:21.168
Push, go fast.

01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:22.628
Hey, you can't. Hey...

01:36:23.212 --> 01:36:25.381
- you can't do that.
- Come on, come on!

01:36:27.007 --> 01:36:28.217
Hang on!

01:36:32.972 --> 01:36:34.598
Hey, where are you going with that?

01:36:39.854 --> 01:36:41.856
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:36:42.773 --> 01:36:45.901
What the hell are you doing, Burt?
What the hell are you doing?

01:36:46.277 --> 01:36:48.154
Just getting her warmed up, Bob.

01:36:48.154 --> 01:36:49.613
Didn't look like you were
getting her warmed up.

01:36:49.864 --> 01:36:52.157
Jesus, he was going to take
the thing for a freakin' run.

01:36:52.157 --> 01:36:53.409
Bob.

01:36:53.409 --> 01:36:54.368
Oh, boy.

01:36:56.412 --> 01:37:00.040
That is the most determined man
I have ever seen in my entire life.

01:37:00.749 --> 01:37:02.668
I kind of feel sorry
for the old cooty.

01:37:04.253 --> 01:37:05.754
Coming all this way.

01:37:06.297 --> 01:37:08.882
Isn't there some way
we can accommodate him?

01:37:08.882 --> 01:37:10.551
I mean there can't be
much risk there...

01:37:10.634 --> 01:37:13.512
his bike will be
lucky if it does 70.

01:37:13.721 --> 01:37:17.099
What do you say? What if we bend
the rules this once, huh?

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:20.519
Jesus!

01:37:23.772 --> 01:37:25.316
Bob and I had a little chat...

01:37:25.566 --> 01:37:28.902
and we're thinking we're gonna
organize a handling run for you.

01:37:29.778 --> 01:37:32.531
- You are? What?
- A handling run.

01:37:32.948 --> 01:37:35.242
All the officials,
we're gonna get into our vehicles and...

01:37:35.242 --> 01:37:36.493
- You're joking, huh?
- No, I'm not.

01:37:36.493 --> 01:37:38.579
We're going to follow
along behind you...

01:37:38.579 --> 01:37:40.539
and we're going to see
if you're okay to ride this beast.

01:37:40.539 --> 01:37:41.707
Of course I'm okay to ride it.

01:37:41.707 --> 01:37:44.835
First thing tomorrow morning, alright?
Bright and early.

01:37:46.837 --> 01:37:48.172
Well, thanks fellas.

01:37:49.131 --> 01:37:51.258
Hey. My luck's in then.

01:37:54.052 --> 01:37:55.846
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:37:55.929 --> 01:37:57.389
Don't hurt yourself.

01:38:08.984 --> 01:38:12.237
Okay, everyone listen up.
This is what we're gonna do.

01:38:12.613 --> 01:38:15.032
Burt, you're gonna get rolling...

01:38:15.198 --> 01:38:18.952
ride slowly along. We'll all jump in
our vehicles, follow you down the track.

01:38:18.994 --> 01:38:21.371
- See if you can handle this thing.
- I'll handle her alright.

01:38:21.622 --> 01:38:23.290
Alright. Everybody got that?

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:26.084
Okay, everybody,
lets get in the cars.

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:52.194
Hope that old man doesn't make
a fool of himself.

01:38:57.324 --> 01:38:58.492
Here we go.

01:38:59.326 --> 01:39:00.994
I'm ready, lets go.

01:39:01.578 --> 01:39:02.537
Push it!

01:39:02.913 --> 01:39:04.414
Faster, boys.

01:39:06.583 --> 01:39:07.793
Go, Burt!

01:39:32.275 --> 01:39:33.401
Sixty.

01:39:33.944 --> 01:39:35.487
Sixty-five, seventy.

01:39:37.113 --> 01:39:38.323
That a boy, Burt.

01:39:38.573 --> 01:39:39.574
Seventy-five.

01:39:40.241 --> 01:39:43.036
There he goes up to eighty,
eighty, eighty five.

01:39:47.666 --> 01:39:48.583
Ninety.

01:39:56.007 --> 01:39:58.593
Ninety-five,
look at that thing go.

01:40:09.312 --> 01:40:12.065
- Holy smoke.
- He's leaving them behind!

01:40:12.399 --> 01:40:14.192
What the hell is
that old guy up to?

01:40:14.192 --> 01:40:15.985
Nobody told him
he could give it everything.

01:40:16.152 --> 01:40:18.530
I guess that solves the question
of whether or not he can handle it.

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:20.990
We were doing ninety-five
and he left us in the dust.

01:40:21.116 --> 01:40:22.575
Look at him go!

01:40:22.784 --> 01:40:23.993
That a boy, go, Burt.

01:41:03.324 --> 01:41:05.243
Hold her firm.

01:41:05.493 --> 01:41:06.577
Hold her firm.

01:41:06.828 --> 01:41:08.871
Got it? Don't let it go.

01:41:10.248 --> 01:41:11.749
That was a disaster!

01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:15.712
- Hey, Burt. How'd it go.
- Not good.

01:41:20.216 --> 01:41:21.718
So, whats the verdict?

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:24.971
When you opened up there in top
gear you sure left us in the dust.

01:41:25.096 --> 01:41:27.598
I couldn't even get her out
of second gear, Earl.

01:41:27.932 --> 01:41:31.811
The plugs were oiling up, I had to feed
her more juice up the revs a little.

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:35.106
Well, I guess we'll see if you're
telling us the truth, Munro.

01:41:36.983 --> 01:41:40.027
Are you telling me I can officially run
on the track and have it timed?

01:41:40.278 --> 01:41:41.863
Thats what I'm saying, Burt.

01:41:44.574 --> 01:41:46.826
You'll never know what
this means to me, Otto.

01:41:46.993 --> 01:41:49.912
25 years I've lived for this day,
25 years.

01:41:50.288 --> 01:41:53.958
Sometimes you've got to bend the rules
a little, today's one of those days.

01:41:54.458 --> 01:41:57.545
- Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.

01:42:03.467 --> 01:42:06.137
- What did they say?
- What happened?

01:42:07.847 --> 01:42:09.515
They said I could run.

01:42:10.433 --> 01:42:11.642
Thats great!

01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:14.687
- So why the long face then?
- Well, I don't know...

01:42:14.729 --> 01:42:18.149
its just starting to sink in
and I've got a problem a big problem.

01:42:18.357 --> 01:42:21.777
As soon as I go over a hundred and
ten it starts to wobble like heck...

01:42:21.861 --> 01:42:23.321
a bad speed wobble.

01:42:23.404 --> 01:42:26.907
Well, it did look like you were
about as stable as my last wife.

01:42:28.576 --> 01:42:31.203
I've got a theory
and I think I'm right.

01:42:31.287 --> 01:42:34.081
I need about twenty car batteries.

01:42:34.165 --> 01:42:35.082
Twenty?

01:42:35.958 --> 01:42:38.085
Is it ok to steel
these batteries, Burt?

01:42:38.335 --> 01:42:40.129
We're not steeling them Marty,
we're souveniring them.

01:42:40.212 --> 01:42:42.047
Careful of that acid there.

01:42:42.506 --> 01:42:44.091
What do we do
with them now?

01:42:44.216 --> 01:42:46.969
Well, we're going to talk someone
into lending us a painter's blow torch.

01:42:47.219 --> 01:42:48.637
A painter's blow torch?

01:42:51.056 --> 01:42:53.559
What are we going to do
with all this metal, Burt?

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:59.106
Well, when this cools down,
we'll have ourselves a lead brick.

01:42:59.356 --> 01:43:03.194
- What do you do with a lead brick?
- Place it in the front of the motorcycle.

01:43:03.819 --> 01:43:05.946
- And thats your plan?
- Yeah.

01:43:07.031 --> 01:43:11.535
Well, you must get the center
of pressure behind the center of gravity...

01:43:11.619 --> 01:43:14.830
and if you don't get it right
then she'll start to fish tail...

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:17.625
- when you get her wound up.
- What do you mean by fish tail?

01:43:17.875 --> 01:43:21.211
Well, like a fish's behind you know.
Itll start doing that.

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:23.756
And thats what happened today
when I had the handling run.

01:43:24.006 --> 01:43:27.635
And so in a panic I lifted my head up
from behind the screen...

01:43:27.927 --> 01:43:31.680
and suddenly the bike started
to go straight and...

01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:36.268
I knew I'd solved the problem somehow
by sticking my head up into the wind.

01:43:37.353 --> 01:43:38.896
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

01:43:39.188 --> 01:43:41.231
Well, I'll show you.
Let me have that.

01:43:42.441 --> 01:43:44.193
What are you doing?

01:43:44.401 --> 01:43:47.946
Lmagine the cigar
is my streamliner.

01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:49.656
Don't poke holes in the cigar.

01:43:49.948 --> 01:43:53.077
Now if I hold it in the middle
and blow on it. Like so.

01:43:54.828 --> 01:43:56.705
See how unstable it is?

01:43:56.872 --> 01:43:58.123
Now if I...

01:43:59.416 --> 01:44:01.126
- shift the...
- Not again!

01:44:01.418 --> 01:44:03.962
Center of pressure here.
And blow on it.

01:44:08.842 --> 01:44:10.344
See its much more stable.

01:44:10.594 --> 01:44:14.765
Just the center of pressure
is behind the center of gravity...

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:17.851
and thats what I'm trying to fix
with the lead brick you see.

01:44:18.101 --> 01:44:19.645
You're quite clever,
did you know that, Burt?

01:44:19.937 --> 01:44:23.482
Now all I need to do is to test
my theory before I run on the salt...

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:24.525
and I was thinking of,
you know...

01:44:24.525 --> 01:44:28.111
crossing over the state line
from here in Utah to Nevada...

01:44:28.403 --> 01:44:32.491
where there's no speed limit and running
with a lead brick in the front of it.

01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:24.209
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:45:24.626 --> 01:45:26.628
Do you know how fast you were
going back there?

01:45:26.795 --> 01:45:28.046
Yeah, about...

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:30.924
150, 160 miles an hour.

01:45:33.844 --> 01:45:35.971
Yeah, that sounds about right.

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.682
How's he going to talk
his way out of this one?

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:42.644
He sure got his arse
in a sling this time, don't he?

01:45:42.978 --> 01:45:46.648
So whats the situation with this thing?
You don't have any license plates on it.

01:45:46.898 --> 01:45:50.151
- Its registered in New Zealand.
- New Zealand?

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.571
Yeah, thats where I come from.

01:45:55.907 --> 01:45:57.575
Alright, you mean to tell me...

01:45:57.575 --> 01:46:00.245
that this contraption of yours
is registered for the road?

01:46:01.329 --> 01:46:04.541
- Yeah, in New Zealand.
- New Zealand, right.

01:46:05.083 --> 01:46:08.378
Well, how about taking it easy
here in Nevada?

01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:10.672
Just because we don't have
a speed limit don't mean...

01:46:10.672 --> 01:46:14.175
- we want people killing themselves.
- No, sounds fair enough to me.

01:46:15.093 --> 01:46:18.096
- Right, you have a good day then.
- I will, thank you.

01:46:18.096 --> 01:46:19.347
Burt, everything OK?

01:46:21.015 --> 01:46:24.853
Well, fellows, we're going to have
to give the lead brick...

01:46:24.936 --> 01:46:26.938
the old Spanish archer.

01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:30.275
- Spanish archer?
- Yeah, the big elbow, you know.

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.069
The lead brick has got to go.

01:46:33.319 --> 01:46:35.655
Who's stupid idea was that anyway?

01:46:35.864 --> 01:46:36.698
It was yours.

01:46:36.781 --> 01:46:41.578
Yeah. Well, I'm just going to have
to ride her, the way she is.

01:46:41.911 --> 01:46:43.288
What about that speed wobble?

01:46:43.538 --> 01:46:46.875
Well, I'll cross that bridge
when I get there.

01:46:47.250 --> 01:46:49.794
- I've got another problem too.
- Yeah, what now?

01:46:50.086 --> 01:46:52.589
Well, when I get her going...

01:46:52.797 --> 01:46:56.467
there's an enormous amount of heat
comes off the exhaust pipe...

01:46:56.718 --> 01:47:00.013
and I hope
it doesn't cook my leg.

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:05.018
Maybe you can wrap some asbestos cloth
around it, that should fix it right.

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:06.311
Thats a good idea.

01:47:06.978 --> 01:47:09.439
So you got any more problems
you want to tell us about?

01:47:09.439 --> 01:47:11.566
Yes, yes, my old ticker.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.902
- You've got a bad heart?
- Yes, I have.

01:47:18.906 --> 01:47:20.825
I've got a little surprise
for you.

01:47:21.367 --> 01:47:24.203
- What?
- Close your eyes and give me your hand.

01:47:24.329 --> 01:47:26.873
- What?
- Just close your eyes. Come on.

01:47:27.123 --> 01:47:29.625
- What for?
- Because I said so, mister, come on.

01:47:32.462 --> 01:47:33.838
Keep walking.

01:47:33.921 --> 01:47:37.592
Wendy, you're not going to make
a fool of an old man I hope.

01:47:37.633 --> 01:47:39.218
I'd never do that, Burt.

01:47:39.469 --> 01:47:40.595
Never.

01:47:40.887 --> 01:47:42.305
Never. Okay. Okay.

01:47:42.597 --> 01:47:44.015
Now turn around.

01:47:44.682 --> 01:47:45.975
Alright.

01:47:45.975 --> 01:47:47.852
Now, hold your hands out.

01:47:48.436 --> 01:47:50.062
Put that in your pocket.

01:47:50.146 --> 01:47:51.230
Alright.

01:47:51.439 --> 01:47:52.565
There we go good.

01:47:53.858 --> 01:47:55.359
You can open them.

01:48:10.499 --> 01:48:12.251
What are you all staring at?

01:48:14.086 --> 01:48:16.088
- What is this?
- Burt...

01:48:16.297 --> 01:48:20.092
we've unanimously voted you here on
the Salt planes, sportsman of the year...

01:48:20.301 --> 01:48:23.638
because we figured nobody has
ever traveled as far as you have...

01:48:23.638 --> 01:48:24.972
to be here for speed week...

01:48:25.056 --> 01:48:28.768
so normally we would present
a trophy or something like that...

01:48:29.018 --> 01:48:31.979
but considering your case
we thought a few extra dollars...

01:48:31.979 --> 01:48:34.857
would be more appreciated
so we past the hat around.

01:48:38.653 --> 01:48:39.987
My goodness!

01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:44.617
There are no words.

01:48:58.339 --> 01:48:59.924
Well, thank you all.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.843
Thank you all very much.

01:49:04.553 --> 01:49:06.972
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

01:49:08.516 --> 01:49:11.435
Oh dear, its quite
overwhelming you know...

01:49:11.727 --> 01:49:14.230
its 25 years dream
to come here.

01:49:17.233 --> 01:49:22.112
I should try
to justify you, your respect and...

01:49:23.239 --> 01:49:28.202
you know the original speed
of my old bike was 54 miles an hour.

01:49:31.121 --> 01:49:35.501
And today I'm hoping to,
you know, improve it a little.

01:49:45.678 --> 01:49:48.973
<i>The cars are at the start line now.
The next one is the 86...</i>

01:49:49.264 --> 01:49:52.643
<i>On the bucket seat
the pilot is ready to be pushed out.</i>

01:50:02.361 --> 01:50:04.071
<i>Next competitor is Burt Munro.</i>

01:50:04.905 --> 01:50:07.866
<i>All the way from Invercargill,
New Zealand.</i>

01:50:09.034 --> 01:50:12.371
<i>Burt Munro's entry
was approved just yesterday.</i>

01:50:20.712 --> 01:50:22.381
Burt, where'd you get this stuff?

01:50:22.464 --> 01:50:24.591
- What?
- I say, where'd you get this stuff?

01:50:24.842 --> 01:50:28.637
I tore an old electric blanket apart
and got the asbestos cloth out of it.

01:50:29.179 --> 01:50:31.306
You got those heart pills?

01:50:31.306 --> 01:50:33.559
- Are you okay?
- Better take one, yeah.

01:50:33.809 --> 01:50:35.310
They're almost ready.

01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:36.979
Guys, come on, lets go.

01:50:38.063 --> 01:50:40.482
You know the bottle says
that they may cause drowsiness...

01:50:40.482 --> 01:50:42.901
- do not operate machinery.
- I know that.

01:50:43.485 --> 01:50:45.279
Well, you're not supposed
to take two of them anyway.

01:50:45.529 --> 01:50:47.698
One for me
and one for the old girl.

01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:49.408
Nitroglycerine.

01:50:49.658 --> 01:50:51.159
Should make it go faster.

01:50:51.785 --> 01:50:53.245
Have some of this, love.

01:50:57.249 --> 01:50:58.417
There you go.

01:51:04.923 --> 01:51:07.551
- Yeah, we're almost there.
- Alright, here we go.

01:51:08.302 --> 01:51:09.678
- Hold her still.
- Your goggles.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:10.679
- What?
- Goggles.

01:51:10.721 --> 01:51:13.056
- Put your goggles on.
- I know, calm down.

01:51:16.852 --> 01:51:21.565
I can't get my leg in because
of the asbestos cloth on it.

01:51:29.656 --> 01:51:30.991
Let me take it off.

01:51:31.241 --> 01:51:34.828
- What about your leg in that heat?
- Screw it, I've got a spare one.

01:51:36.997 --> 01:51:38.540
Right, Burt.

01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:40.125
Get those goggles.

01:51:41.209 --> 01:51:43.670
- Ready?
- Alright, you know the way.

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:44.838
Make sure you come back.

01:51:45.088 --> 01:51:46.298
Come on, lets go!

01:51:46.548 --> 01:51:47.716
Right, push!

01:51:48.758 --> 01:51:50.510
Come on, fellas. Push faster!

01:51:52.637 --> 01:51:53.889
Keep running.

01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:59.186
Keep it straight, buddy.

01:52:00.812 --> 01:52:03.106
Bring it in, Burt. Come on.
Go, go, go...

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.608
Lets go, Burt!

01:52:10.447 --> 01:52:11.406
Come on, Burt!

01:52:12.032 --> 01:52:13.658
You can do it, Burt.

01:52:13.908 --> 01:52:16.119
He's got no parachute,
he's got no brakes.

01:52:35.638 --> 01:52:37.515
158.647.

01:52:38.058 --> 01:52:41.436
Mile one,
158.647 miles per hour.

01:52:41.686 --> 01:52:42.979
Go, Burt!

01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:45.106
- Go on!
- Go, Burt!

01:52:45.565 --> 01:52:47.650
- Make us proud, honey!
- Burt!

01:53:02.707 --> 01:53:04.626
167.921.

01:53:04.834 --> 01:53:08.505
Mile two,
167.921 miles per hour.

01:53:08.671 --> 01:53:11.216
Break it, Burt.
Come on! Go, go, go!

01:53:11.382 --> 01:53:12.342
Come on, Burt.

01:53:22.477 --> 01:53:26.356
<i>Mile three,
171.371 miles per hour.</i>

01:53:26.606 --> 01:53:28.107
Come on, come on, come on!

01:53:39.661 --> 01:53:42.997
Mile four,
172.485 miles per hour.

01:53:43.748 --> 01:53:44.707
Yeah!

01:53:44.957 --> 01:53:45.833
Come on!

01:53:47.418 --> 01:53:50.380
<i>Mile five,
183.694 miles per hour.</i>

01:54:10.316 --> 01:54:12.276
<i>193.728.</i>

01:54:12.527 --> 01:54:15.363
Mile six,
193.728 miles per hour.

01:54:16.447 --> 01:54:18.491
Come on, come on!

01:54:23.496 --> 01:54:25.790
Come on, Burt.
You can do it!

01:54:25.998 --> 01:54:27.083
Come on, Burt!

01:54:27.583 --> 01:54:31.045
<i>Mile seven,
194.211 miles per hour.</i>

01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:34.131
- Go, Burt!
- Burt, go!

01:55:18.926 --> 01:55:19.802
What is it?

01:55:20.803 --> 01:55:22.721
201.851.

01:55:23.139 --> 01:55:27.768
Mile eight,
201.851 miles per hour.

01:55:35.442 --> 01:55:38.028
Ladies and gentlemen,
thats a new record...

01:55:38.279 --> 01:55:42.324
201.851 miles per hour.

01:55:44.827 --> 01:55:46.912
Burt, I hope you're going
to stop soon.

01:55:47.371 --> 01:55:50.165
- He's gone back!
- Back where?

01:55:50.416 --> 01:55:54.420
Back to whatever planet he came from
because he sure ain't from this one.

01:56:48.515 --> 01:56:50.434
I really did toast my leg.

01:56:56.148 --> 01:56:57.399
I did it.

01:56:58.108 --> 01:56:59.276
I did it.

01:57:29.348 --> 01:57:32.100
Tom, can you get that,
my hands are wet.

01:57:37.439 --> 01:57:38.648
Hello?

01:57:38.648 --> 01:57:42.319
<i>This is the United States calling I have
a collect call from Mr. Burt Munro...</i>

01:57:42.569 --> 01:57:43.862
<i>will you accept the charge?</i>

01:57:43.987 --> 01:57:48.283
- Mum, its Burt calling collect.
- It is? Accept the call, accept the call!

01:57:48.533 --> 01:57:49.868
My mum said we can accept the call.

01:57:49.951 --> 01:57:52.788
<i>- Go ahead, sir.
- Hello Tom, is that you?</i>

01:57:52.996 --> 01:57:55.040
<i>- Yes.
- Its me, Burt.</i>

01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:58.794
<i>I did it Tom,
she's the worlďs fastest Indian.</i>

01:57:58.877 --> 01:57:59.795
She is?

01:58:00.045 --> 01:58:01.254
Dad, dad!

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.716
Dad! He did it! Burt did it!

01:58:05.008 --> 01:58:06.426
He set a new record.

01:58:25.111 --> 01:58:26.154
How is it going?

01:58:26.238 --> 01:58:27.697
Hello, mate!

01:58:27.739 --> 01:58:29.115
- Hey, Duncan.
- Congratulations, Burt.

01:58:29.199 --> 01:58:30.533
Hello, Frank.
How are you?

01:58:30.784 --> 01:58:32.786
- Welcome home, Burt.
- Hello, George.

01:58:32.827 --> 01:58:36.164
My goodness, you've made
this place look spiffing, mate.

01:58:36.414 --> 01:58:37.624
You did us proud.

01:58:37.624 --> 01:58:41.127
- You put Invercargill on the map.
- Well, I reckon so, yeah.

01:58:41.211 --> 01:58:44.005
- What have you got planned now?
- Right now I've a lot of work to do...

01:58:44.047 --> 01:58:46.841
if I'm to get back to Bonneville
next year, you know.

01:58:46.966 --> 01:58:49.177
So, more early mornings then?

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:51.137
Yeah, more early mornings.

01:58:51.388 --> 01:58:52.514
Hello, love.

01:58:52.597 --> 01:58:54.891
- Welcome home.
- Nice to be back.

01:58:56.017 --> 01:58:57.936
- Hello, Tom.
- Hey, Burt.

01:58:58.269 --> 01:58:59.896
How are you, son?

01:59:00.230 --> 01:59:01.564
Good to see ya.

01:59:01.815 --> 01:59:03.441
You're growing up a bit, huh?

01:59:04.025 --> 01:59:06.069
I looked after your lemon tree
just like you told me.

01:59:06.152 --> 01:59:07.445
You did, yeah.

01:59:07.695 --> 01:59:08.947
Its doing well isn't it?

01:59:09.447 --> 01:59:10.657
Yeah, its beautiful.

01:59:11.908 --> 01:59:13.910
- I fed the chickens.
- You did?

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.079
- And mum cooked all the eggs.
- Oh, yeah...

01:59:16.329 --> 01:59:18.331
- did they taste good?
- Yep.

01:59:18.581 --> 01:59:20.458
- Yeah, good. Have you got my key?
- Here it is.

01:59:20.458 --> 01:59:21.835
- Right thanks.
- I took good care of it.

01:59:22.210 --> 01:59:24.712
- I knew you would.
- How fast did you go?

01:59:24.963 --> 01:59:28.299
Mighty fast. In one of my runs
I did over 200 miles an hour.

01:59:28.508 --> 01:59:31.469
What would happen if you opened
your mouth at that speed?

01:59:31.719 --> 01:59:34.055
Well, you'd blow the backside
out of your pants I reckon.

01:59:36.266 --> 01:59:37.475
Right, lets see.

01:59:40.061 --> 01:59:42.939
<i>Its nice to be home.
Back in my shed.</i>
