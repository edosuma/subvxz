01:03.500 --> 01:06.435
It is safe to assume
that professional wrestlers...

01:06.602 --> 01:11.562
...are universally recognized
as the greatest athletes of all time.

01:13.108 --> 01:15.668
Sammartino, Blassie,
Gorgeous George...

01:15.911 --> 01:18.778
...George "The Animal" Steele,
Superfly Snooka...

01:18.981 --> 01:21.142
...Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan.

01:23.819 --> 01:26.014
These are heroes of history.

01:26.222 --> 01:28.383
Superior athletes...

01:28.591 --> 01:30.024
...superior men.

01:36.332 --> 01:40.995
Giants come and go in this great sport
of ours, but there is only one king:

01:41.236 --> 01:42.760
Jimmy King.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.296
Jimmy King is the greatest
wrestler of all time.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.476
He's undefeated,
and he holds the record...

01:49.644 --> 01:53.512
...for the longest winning streak in
the history of professional wrestling.

01:54.916 --> 01:57.612
King says, and I quote:

01:59.220 --> 02:01.051
"People said I was a dreamer...

02:01.256 --> 02:04.885
...an idiot, and a waste of life,
and I will never amount to anything."

02:05.093 --> 02:06.560
Hey, jackass.

02:07.362 --> 02:11.196
You're a waste of life. Why don't you
go amount to nothing somewhere else?

02:11.399 --> 02:15.733
And I told you little turdlets not to
park your junk in front of the shop!

02:18.172 --> 02:19.571
Wrestling is for retards!

02:20.942 --> 02:22.603
"Jimmy King's the greatest!"

02:24.112 --> 02:26.080
You guys are as dumb as paint.

02:26.848 --> 02:28.543
Really dumb paint.

02:30.852 --> 02:32.581
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

02:32.755 --> 02:36.418
Listen, Jimmy King is
the people's champion.

02:37.026 --> 02:39.586
He's immortal, timeless.
He can raise the dead!

02:39.828 --> 02:44.629
Can he really raise the dead? My dog,
Skipper, is buried under my sandbox.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.691
Well, I don't know
about your dog, Skipper.

02:47.970 --> 02:50.564
But don't worry,
because tomorrow night...

02:50.739 --> 02:54.435
...Jimmy King is gonna whup
Diamond Dallas Page's ass.

02:54.609 --> 02:55.940
We're gonna be there.

02:56.611 --> 02:57.908
Right, Gordie?

02:59.447 --> 03:00.414
Gordie?

03:05.386 --> 03:06.353
Gordie?

03:14.996 --> 03:16.964
What do you want, boob?

03:17.198 --> 03:19.996
Purple sugar slush, king-size.

03:20.201 --> 03:22.396
That'll be $1.26.

03:24.973 --> 03:27.441
$1.25. That's all I got.

03:27.742 --> 03:31.200
That's just not good enough,
now, is it, you little boob?

03:31.446 --> 03:34.040
You little Jimmy the King fan boob!

03:34.248 --> 03:38.651
Jimmy King's a big fat loser!
He's a sissy in tights!

03:39.354 --> 03:43.222
There's a lot of glare coming off
that dome of yours, squirrel nuts!

03:45.360 --> 03:46.759
Listen, sunshine...

03:46.995 --> 03:50.692
...l'm gonna open up a fresh can
of whup-ass on you, boy!

03:52.400 --> 03:54.095
Bring it on!

04:02.411 --> 04:04.140
Tag me! Tag me!

04:05.213 --> 04:06.646
Now you're gonna get it!

04:06.914 --> 04:09.712
You messed with
the "Macho Man" Randy Savage!

04:10.785 --> 04:12.980
I'm gonna get you! Yeah!

04:14.155 --> 04:16.089
Bam! Bam! Bam!

04:19.260 --> 04:20.226
King!

04:57.999 --> 05:00.263
One! Two! Three!

05:10.578 --> 05:12.011
Gordie?

05:12.480 --> 05:16.883
Whoa, serious brain freeze.
That icy sugar locked up my nog-nog.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.982
What about me, guy?
I was thirsty too.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.247
I'll get you a refill.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.481
No, don't sweat it.
The guy's a moron.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.292
Come on, I feel bad.

05:28.996 --> 05:29.928
Hey, Gordie?

05:30.898 --> 05:31.762
Yeah?

05:32.066 --> 05:34.830
Why does it look like you have
your finger in your butt?

05:36.037 --> 05:37.197
Because I do.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.475
Jerko, what do you want?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.810
- I need a new sugar slush.
- Why?

05:51.586 --> 05:54.680
There's something wrong
with this one. Smell it.

05:57.759 --> 05:58.783
That's awful.

05:59.594 --> 06:00.686
I know.

06:00.895 --> 06:02.362
Smells like...

06:02.597 --> 06:05.088
- Like...
- Like my ass, right?

06:05.600 --> 06:09.696
- Or maybe your ass. It's weird, huh?
- Like a bitter, sour ass!

06:09.904 --> 06:11.872
Like you poured it from your butt.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.444
I will get you another one ASAP.

06:17.645 --> 06:20.079
- Thanks.
- It's so bad.

06:20.281 --> 06:21.646
How could you drink that?

06:22.483 --> 06:26.920
I struggled through most of it, but
the butt-fruit settled at the bottom.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.521
Freeze, loafer!

06:36.463 --> 06:39.159
Come on. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.334
Come on, you know the drill.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.805
You got any stuff on you?

06:48.508 --> 06:50.476
Whoa. What's this?

06:50.677 --> 06:51.644
My nuts.

06:52.879 --> 06:56.679
Listen, pal, wouldn't you rather
be on the other side of this search?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.647
You want me to grab your nuts?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.683
Whoa. Yeah, you too.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.689
Come on, sweetheart. Join the party.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.449
Keep your hands where I can see them!

07:08.930 --> 07:11.364
Dad, you gotta cut the crap
with the shakedowns.

07:11.566 --> 07:15.935
You're gonna be a good cop, Gordie.
It'll change your life.

07:16.170 --> 07:19.162
Look what it's done
for your mom and your sister.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.533
What is this crap?

07:22.743 --> 07:23.903
Wrestling?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.843
Wrestling's fake.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.948
Wrestling's not fake!

07:35.857 --> 07:36.881
I like wrestling.

07:37.158 --> 07:39.149
Are you gonna be a wrestler?

07:39.727 --> 07:40.853
You got trouble...

07:41.062 --> 07:44.724
...wrestling your wee-wee out
of your trousers to take a leak.

07:44.931 --> 07:49.027
It's not that I have trouble.
Just sometimes I don't see the point.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.293
Gordon.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.869
Wrestling's a game for little boys.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.571
Police work's for men.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.411
Come on, let's bounce.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.584
Wrestling's for dirtbags
and lily-pickers.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.344
You'll be back.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.579
The badge'll be waiting!

08:18.431 --> 08:21.764
- My dad sucks, man.
- At least you got one.

08:22.469 --> 08:26.906
Right, sorry. It's just that he's
always on my ass about getting a job.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.041
I mean, he's making me
take that cop exam.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.212
- You have a job.
- I know.

08:34.115 --> 08:36.879
I should decide what
I want to do with my life.

08:37.083 --> 08:39.313
- That's right.
- Like Jimmy King says:

08:39.520 --> 08:42.284
"This is America.
I can be anyone I want!"

08:42.490 --> 08:45.823
He actually says,
"I can beat up anyone I want."

08:46.027 --> 08:47.654
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.830
But who cares, bro?
What's tonight?

08:50.598 --> 08:52.862
Monday Night Nitro!

08:53.067 --> 08:55.228
Live, baby, live
Live, baby, live

09:04.711 --> 09:07.407
This'll be awesome.
It'll be out of control.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.715
Page vs. King
and it's not a pay-per-view?

09:10.917 --> 09:11.941
Oh, yeah!

09:15.855 --> 09:18.119
Hey, shit-boys!
How's the shit work?

09:18.758 --> 09:21.283
Excuse the mess.
My aim's a little off.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.826
I've been using the jackhammer.

09:30.437 --> 09:33.565
All done. We did it.
Good job, Gordie.

09:35.875 --> 09:36.933
You too.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.372
Little too much coffee for me today.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.122
- Don't do it.
- What?

09:50.390 --> 09:52.824
Don't "what" me.
You know what. Don't do it.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.154
- Friends don't do it to friends.
- Okay.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.758
If you do it, Jimmy King'll
get hurt tonight. Don't.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.434
Don't worry. I won't.

10:20.020 --> 10:20.850
Gordie?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.055
Nothing can hurt Jimmy King.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.422
Stop it!

10:30.096 --> 10:31.586
Gordie, stop it, please!

10:31.765 --> 10:33.130
I'm gonna kick your ass!

10:35.635 --> 10:37.432
Make it stop!

10:38.972 --> 10:40.701
Sorry, man, I couldn't help it.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.934
Sean, are you okay, man?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.406
Sean!

10:55.255 --> 10:58.224
Couldn't help it?
I can't help delivering a suplex!

10:59.125 --> 11:00.456
Get off me!

11:08.868 --> 11:11.530
Welcome to EZ Take-Out Burger.
How may I help you?

11:12.205 --> 11:15.800
Sean wants Brittany's taco,
with cheese all over it.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.998
Stop!

11:17.677 --> 11:21.476
I should have smelled it was you.
What do you guys want?

11:21.881 --> 11:24.509
Hi, Brittany, I'm sorry.
Can I please have...

11:25.585 --> 11:27.553
...a cheeseburger maxi-meal...

11:27.720 --> 11:32.123
- And a Brittany bare-ass buffet...
- Please! Please!

11:32.358 --> 11:33.154
What?

11:33.526 --> 11:37.257
He said that he wanted the Brittany...
Stop it!

11:37.497 --> 11:39.488
- Did you say...?
- We'll pull up now.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.361
Why?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.298
Why don't you just ask her out?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.666
How does my hair look?
Is it the Finesse?

11:47.874 --> 11:51.435
You're driving a truck of ass-juice.
Don't worry about your hair.

11:51.778 --> 11:56.215
I cannot deal with these losers.
I'm gonna work with the cheese.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.080
Hi, Gordie.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.720
- Sean.
- Hi, Wendy.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.152
- Where'd Brittany go?
- She switched to cheese.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.192
Sean, you think King's gonna put
a hurting on Diamond Dallas Page?

12:11.097 --> 12:12.860
Yes, I most certainly do.

12:13.066 --> 12:17.332
Hey, Brittany! How's the weather
in there? Cold today, hot tamale?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.561
Leave me alone, loser!

12:19.772 --> 12:23.071
Au corvair. Would a loser
have two tickets...

12:23.276 --> 12:26.871
...to Monday Night Nitro,
live from Cheyenne, tonight?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.569
Yes.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.883
Brittany, listen.
Let's go out again.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.679
We'll go out.
We won't talk about wrestling.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.048
We'll talk about us...

12:42.127 --> 12:43.924
You should give up on Brittany.

12:44.129 --> 12:48.930
No way. She's my dream girl, bro.
Come on.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.831
Well, what about Wendy?
She digs you.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.303
No. She's too much
like one of the guys.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.677
- That's bad?
- That's gay.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.082
Right.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.585
Look what I made.

13:15.662 --> 13:16.959
Oh, wicked.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.024
No. It stands for something.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.694
W-W-K-D.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.603
"What Would King Do?"

13:25.538 --> 13:28.166
When I got a problem
and don't know what to do...

13:28.374 --> 13:30.968
...I look down, and I look at it
and I think:

13:32.712 --> 13:34.339
What would King do?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.015
Man, that rocks.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.650
I made two.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.290
That rocks hard, man.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.255
Mrs. MacKenzie!

13:53.532 --> 13:55.659
Ready for that big match tonight?

13:55.867 --> 14:00.429
Oh, yes, boys. Jimmy King is gonna
bitch-slap Diamond Dallas.

14:00.639 --> 14:03.233
We're gonna be there.
We're going.

14:04.042 --> 14:07.671
Get me a T-shirt.
A really tight one.

14:09.214 --> 14:11.182
That's gross, Mrs. MacKenzie.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.853
Freeze!

14:23.763 --> 14:26.231
Your sister shot her first perp today.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.099
That's nice, Gabby.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.169
She put one shot in his right buttock.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.840
Just doing her job.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.643
That's great. See you guys later.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You better be back by 11.

14:41.914 --> 14:44.212
You got a police admission
seminar tomorrow.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.675
I've given that a lot of thought...

14:48.955 --> 14:50.047
See you at 11.

15:04.002 --> 15:06.368
Kid, move your fat head!
I can't see!

15:06.571 --> 15:09.301
Sorry, Uncle Billy said
they were good seats.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.503
Uncle Billy sucks!

15:11.710 --> 15:13.610
He lost his right nut in Nam.

15:13.812 --> 15:17.339
Kick him in his left nut
when you see him. These seats bite!

15:17.883 --> 15:20.818
Hey, if you only have one left...

15:21.086 --> 15:22.951
...is it still your left nut?

15:25.590 --> 15:27.751
Let's get closer.
King's coming up.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.469
Nitro girls, dead ahead.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.742
There's Chae. She's the best.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.885
Do not concur.
Sasha is the best of the best.

16:12.103 --> 16:13.502
How you doing, Booker?

16:13.704 --> 16:17.435
How you doing, boys?
Look, King's late again.

16:17.641 --> 16:20.667
I don't know what to do.
I'm so sick of this shit.

16:20.911 --> 16:23.709
- What's the finish?
- The finish is gonna be...

16:25.449 --> 16:28.714
He'll pile-drive you, crown you,
and he's gonna get the win.

16:28.919 --> 16:30.910
Works for me.
I'll tell the King.

16:31.155 --> 16:32.645
Nice to see you, Billy.

16:32.890 --> 16:34.949
Dallas, I want to talk to you.

16:37.428 --> 16:39.123
Forget what I just told you.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.764
Remember I told you
I'd take care of you?

16:42.400 --> 16:43.594
Tonight's your night.

16:43.801 --> 16:45.826
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

16:47.405 --> 16:48.702
Works for me, bro.

16:50.174 --> 16:51.106
Ladies and gentlemen...

16:51.308 --> 16:55.438
...here we go with tonight's main
event for the WCWheavyweight crown.

16:55.613 --> 16:57.513
Page vs. King! Page vs. King!

16:57.715 --> 16:59.979
- Hell, yeah!
- Page vs. King!

17:00.184 --> 17:02.516
Diamond Dallas Page!

17:12.830 --> 17:15.492
It's time, folks.
It's finally here.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.930
King vs. Diamond Dallas Page.

17:18.136 --> 17:22.835
Come on, Diamond Dallas.
Take it like the punk bitch you are!

17:23.275 --> 17:26.607
The King of Rock
is holding court tonight.

17:26.844 --> 17:30.177
Here's the reigning WCW Heavyweight...

17:30.381 --> 17:32.076
...Champion of the World:

17:32.283 --> 17:36.276
Please welcome Jimmy King!

17:37.221 --> 17:38.415
Behold the King!

18:04.582 --> 18:06.049
Yeah, baby!

18:06.283 --> 18:08.080
All night long.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.587
Here comes Jimmy.

18:14.792 --> 18:18.694
Look at that. With all the majesty
and flair befitting a true king.

18:24.602 --> 18:28.561
Hello, Cheyenne, Wyoming.
We're gonna rule some ass tonight!

18:31.408 --> 18:34.468
I want to welcome you
to the royal ass-kicking...

18:34.678 --> 18:37.168
...of Diamond Dallas Page!

18:40.618 --> 18:43.610
You wanna see me make
Diamond Dallas Page...

18:43.888 --> 18:47.119
...one of my ladies
in waiting tonight?

18:48.292 --> 18:52.319
You wanna see me take
Diamond Dallas Page...

18:52.563 --> 18:54.554
...down into my dungeon...

18:54.832 --> 18:59.360
...and make him my medieval
puppy-dog bitch tonight?

19:00.504 --> 19:02.301
Yeah! That's what I thought!

19:02.907 --> 19:05.467
- I'm the...
- Sing it, man!

19:05.676 --> 19:07.803
I'm King of Rock
There is none higher

19:08.045 --> 19:10.309
Sucker emcees just call me sire

19:10.514 --> 19:12.573
To rule my kingdom
You must use fire

19:12.983 --> 19:15.884
I won't stop rocking till I retire

19:16.086 --> 19:17.986
I love that shit!

19:27.765 --> 19:30.359
Look and listen
to this capacity crowd...

19:30.568 --> 19:34.129
...and the reaction we would
expect for Titus Sinclair...

19:34.371 --> 19:36.066
...who's in the ring.

19:36.273 --> 19:37.900
Glad you made it.

19:38.709 --> 19:41.200
- Boo!
- You suck, Sinclair!

19:41.412 --> 19:44.404
For chrissake, Titus,
you're hogging my spotlight.

19:44.615 --> 19:47.982
Your spotlight?
I invented you, you idiot.

19:48.185 --> 19:50.914
This is mine.
You seem to have forgotten that.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.587
Count your money, midget.

19:54.857 --> 19:56.324
You know, Jimmy...

19:56.693 --> 20:00.925
...you're still the same dumb trailer
hitch I discovered 14 years ago.

20:04.033 --> 20:07.662
I just want to have
this final moment together.

20:14.378 --> 20:16.938
The bell sounds
and the battle is underway.

20:17.181 --> 20:20.275
What, Elvis? Won't be on time
with the rest of us?

20:20.517 --> 20:23.486
Traffic, baby, traffic.
Come on, come on!

20:26.957 --> 20:28.822
You're not too good today, King.

20:29.059 --> 20:30.890
- What you got?
- Hammerlock, baby.

20:31.095 --> 20:32.494
Good God!

20:34.832 --> 20:37.096
The King's showing
what's made him the champion.

20:37.701 --> 20:38.690
Ready?

20:41.038 --> 20:42.630
Good sound effects.

20:57.588 --> 20:59.283
Double neck-breaker.
Both men are down!

20:59.790 --> 21:03.088
What a vicious move that is!
King goes for the cover.

21:03.292 --> 21:05.954
He's trying for an early win.
He didn't get it.

21:07.130 --> 21:09.860
- Three!
- You do your job, I'll do mine.

21:18.307 --> 21:20.207
Okay, Pagey. Hip toss, baby.

21:22.311 --> 21:25.371
Oh, did you see that elbow?
Down goes Jimmy King!

21:25.581 --> 21:27.071
What the hell was that?

21:35.159 --> 21:36.126
Jimmy's in trouble!

21:36.360 --> 21:39.727
This is as vicious as we've
ever seen Diamond Dallas Page!

21:39.963 --> 21:42.022
- What are you doing?
- Get out of my face!

21:42.700 --> 21:43.724
Why?

21:44.868 --> 21:46.733
Boss's orders, fat boy.

21:56.613 --> 21:59.138
- Kick his leathery ass!
- Destroy him!

21:59.383 --> 22:01.544
And Jimmy King is not done yet!

22:01.719 --> 22:05.155
A pair of shots from King
has DDP on the defensive.

22:09.093 --> 22:10.321
See you!

22:18.568 --> 22:20.900
He broke the table!
Oh, my goodness!

22:25.141 --> 22:27.632
King down on the floor,
trying to get up to a knee.

22:27.877 --> 22:28.901
Come on, fat boy.

22:29.178 --> 22:31.112
Let me help you back in. Come on.

22:32.415 --> 22:36.579
Out of nowhere, Jimmy King with a
foreign object to the head of DDP!

22:36.753 --> 22:38.345
King mounting the corner.

22:38.588 --> 22:40.954
I think he's gonna
go up for the crown.

22:41.557 --> 22:44.526
- Crown him, King!
- Prepare to be varnished!

22:53.536 --> 22:57.472
Here's a move we've seen before.
Very familiar. Diamond Dallas...

22:57.673 --> 23:00.938
...motioning to the crowd that
it's time for the diamond cutter.

23:02.746 --> 23:03.940
King caught him!

23:04.181 --> 23:08.277
That will stop anything, including
the diamond cutter, I'll tell you.

23:08.619 --> 23:10.348
Both men down!
Wait a minute!

23:10.554 --> 23:13.250
Here come Page's goons,
led by Sid Vicious!

23:13.457 --> 23:18.156
They're the biggest, meanest men
in our sport, coming to help Dallas.

23:18.529 --> 23:19.587
Watch out, King!

23:27.103 --> 23:29.264
Power bomb by Sid Vicious on King!

23:32.341 --> 23:34.104
The double diamond cutter!

23:34.577 --> 23:35.669
No! No!

23:37.780 --> 23:39.270
Toss him out!

23:41.784 --> 23:46.278
Here they come! Finally, the King's
men have come to bail him out!

23:46.522 --> 23:48.490
- That's right!
- Oh, yeah!

23:48.691 --> 23:53.094
The wrestlers are surrounding King.
I don't know what's going on here.

23:54.163 --> 23:57.530
Wait a minute.
They're all attacking Jimmy King!

23:58.134 --> 24:01.103
They turned on him!
Sinclair must have got to them.

24:05.141 --> 24:06.574
What's wrong with you?

24:07.577 --> 24:11.274
DDP motioning to his goons
to head up to the top rope.

24:12.582 --> 24:13.549
King!

24:20.990 --> 24:24.255
This is what you get when you
suck your money down the toilet!

24:24.460 --> 24:27.190
- You jinxed him!
- No, God, no!

24:27.396 --> 24:30.695
- Get off of me!
- This isn't even a pay-per-view!

24:31.168 --> 24:32.066
Four men.

24:32.302 --> 24:35.169
There's four wrestlers
on the four corner posts.

24:35.839 --> 24:38.672
- A four-post massacre!
- No one can survive this!

24:39.543 --> 24:40.770
No!

24:52.588 --> 24:56.922
It's a four-post massacre.
They all come up at the same time!

24:57.159 --> 24:58.592
Incredible!

24:59.328 --> 25:02.024
Come on, get up! Count him out!
Count him out!

25:04.567 --> 25:08.594
Count it, ref.
One! Two! Three!

25:09.372 --> 25:11.203
Ladies and gentlemen.

25:11.407 --> 25:14.808
Your winner and new WCW...

25:15.044 --> 25:17.239
...Heavyweight Champion
of the World:

25:17.446 --> 25:20.847
Diamond Dallas Page!

25:25.821 --> 25:27.789
Ladies and gentlemen.

25:29.992 --> 25:32.586
You have witnessed the demise...

25:32.828 --> 25:34.420
...of Jimmy King.

25:35.364 --> 25:38.060
He will never, ever...

25:38.301 --> 25:42.499
...fight for the WCW again.

25:42.672 --> 25:47.371
Long live the new king
and reigning champion...

25:47.576 --> 25:50.977
...Diamond Dallas Page!

25:56.251 --> 25:57.650
Feel that, Jimmy?

25:58.587 --> 26:00.646
That's your spotlight fading.

26:02.291 --> 26:04.282
- Why?
- Why?

26:05.227 --> 26:06.751
Why not?

26:06.996 --> 26:10.261
You're through. I'm done with you.

26:12.668 --> 26:14.499
Rest in peace.

26:32.488 --> 26:33.477
Damn allergies.

26:33.689 --> 26:37.819
Yeah, me too.
Damn stupid allergies.

26:38.027 --> 26:40.291
Unfair, bogus allergies!

26:44.734 --> 26:47.396
Unfair, cheating, blind ref!

26:47.570 --> 26:50.562
Bogus Sinclair allergies!

26:50.806 --> 26:53.297
Damn Diamond Dallas Page!

26:53.509 --> 26:55.841
Right, Sean, let it out, man.

26:56.045 --> 26:59.481
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

27:13.194 --> 27:16.027
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy...

27:18.500 --> 27:20.229
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

27:22.604 --> 27:23.662
Oh, my God.

27:25.807 --> 27:26.865
We made it!

27:27.109 --> 27:28.872
We're alive!

27:31.113 --> 27:33.104
Would that be raw sewage I'm smelling?

27:33.682 --> 27:36.879
Yeah. I kind of
always liked the smell.

27:38.154 --> 27:41.590
Yeah, me too.
Kind of smells like French toast.

27:42.058 --> 27:45.516
What? French toast dipped in shit.

27:55.938 --> 27:58.771
Damn it, Jim.
We're firemen, not janitors.

27:58.974 --> 28:01.465
We sure as hell
aren't gonna clean this up.

28:23.865 --> 28:24.957
Shit!

28:41.749 --> 28:43.614
What're the odds of that?

28:58.801 --> 29:02.168
That truck and that business were
all my dad left me when he died.

29:02.872 --> 29:05.067
That's all I've got
to remember him by.

29:05.674 --> 29:09.610
I'll remember my dad by the epic
beating I get for coming home late.

29:11.113 --> 29:12.603
We got no jobs, Gordie.

29:12.848 --> 29:14.873
State police, here I come.

29:16.585 --> 29:19.019
I can't believe how much we suck!

29:19.221 --> 29:21.280
Everything's changed overnight.

29:21.557 --> 29:23.991
Yeah, but if Jimmy King
can win the title back...

29:24.226 --> 29:25.352
- Gordie.
- What?

29:25.594 --> 29:29.792
You heard what Sinclair said, right?
He kicked Jimmy King out of the WCW.

29:29.999 --> 29:32.558
A lifetime ban. No rematch.

29:32.934 --> 29:35.198
It's over, Gordie.

29:35.436 --> 29:37.700
Jimmy King's dead, okay?

29:38.673 --> 29:40.538
- Sean?
- What?

29:41.176 --> 29:43.076
You think things
happen for a reason?

29:43.278 --> 29:46.543
What could possibly
be the reason for this?

29:46.748 --> 29:49.842
All right. Don't you think
it's a little strange...

29:50.084 --> 29:53.053
...that we were in Cheyenne
the same day Jimmy King...

29:53.288 --> 29:57.725
...was cheated out of his title
and banned from the WCW for life?

29:57.926 --> 30:02.363
Don't you think it's strange that
we crashed the truck on the way home?

30:02.597 --> 30:06.033
It's a little strange,
but what are we supposed to do?

30:06.234 --> 30:07.496
Exactly.

30:08.603 --> 30:09.661
What?

30:10.805 --> 30:12.329
What would King do?

30:13.908 --> 30:15.967
I don't know, Gordie.
What would he do?

30:16.211 --> 30:18.771
I'll tell you.
He'd fight to make it right.

30:20.081 --> 30:23.983
You just let me know when he
shows up and does that, okay?

30:24.553 --> 30:28.421
There's a part of King inside me,
telling me we got one choice.

30:29.391 --> 30:31.086
We gotta find Jimmy King.

30:32.294 --> 30:34.285
This must've happened for a reason.

30:34.563 --> 30:36.622
It's gotta be some kind of test.

30:38.567 --> 30:40.262
We gotta find the King.

30:42.704 --> 30:44.672
We gotta find the King?

30:47.507 --> 30:48.439
You and me?

30:49.509 --> 30:53.377
Things happen for a reason, man.
We gotta find the King.

30:53.580 --> 30:54.638
What do you say?

30:57.451 --> 30:59.078
How far is Atlanta from here?

31:06.293 --> 31:08.193
Sir, it's cold.

31:08.996 --> 31:09.963
Jerk!

31:13.800 --> 31:15.392
- Oh, yes.
- Thank God.

31:18.438 --> 31:21.407
Hey. We're trying to get to Atlanta.

31:21.642 --> 31:24.440
We're headed to Daytona.
Atlanta's on our way.

31:25.012 --> 31:26.411
Come on in, boys.

31:26.613 --> 31:27.580
Hallelujah.

31:29.883 --> 31:32.351
Kumbaya, my Lord

31:32.919 --> 31:34.682
Kumbaya

31:36.123 --> 31:39.217
Kumbaya, my Lord

31:39.459 --> 31:41.859
Kumbaya

31:43.664 --> 31:46.690
Michael, row your boat ashore

31:46.933 --> 31:49.800
Alleluia

31:50.004 --> 31:53.235
Michael, row your boat ashore

31:53.608 --> 31:55.575
Alleluia

31:58.245 --> 32:00.907
- Do you guys know any Van Halen?
- No.

32:01.748 --> 32:02.715
No.

32:03.650 --> 32:04.617
No.

32:08.789 --> 32:11.349
Running with the devil

32:13.860 --> 32:17.091
Running with the devil

32:19.166 --> 32:20.326
Break it down, mama.

32:20.534 --> 32:25.471
I live my life
Like there's no tomorrow

32:25.706 --> 32:29.164
All I've got I had to steal

32:29.643 --> 32:30.940
She stole it.

32:32.179 --> 32:35.615
I don't need to beg or borrow

32:35.816 --> 32:40.082
Yes, I'm living at a pace that kills

32:43.757 --> 32:47.659
Running with the devil

32:48.729 --> 32:51.926
Running with the devil

32:52.366 --> 32:54.231
Oh, yeah

33:08.748 --> 33:10.238
- Thank you.
- See you later.

33:10.850 --> 33:12.249
You chicks rock!

33:15.187 --> 33:19.123
Hey, bro, I know we just
got all this religion...

33:19.359 --> 33:22.385
...but I got a question,
and I need a serious answer.

33:22.596 --> 33:24.325
- Swear to God?
- Swear to God.

33:26.099 --> 33:27.566
Did you fart in that van?

33:29.302 --> 33:30.826
It wasn't me. Swear to God.

33:31.071 --> 33:32.766
Me neither. Swear to God.

33:34.574 --> 33:36.166
Oh, my God.

33:36.410 --> 33:38.435
They were the farting nuns.

33:41.515 --> 33:42.675
Bingo!

33:42.949 --> 33:44.314
Let's do this.

33:46.887 --> 33:49.481
I will rule you!

33:56.596 --> 33:59.463
Gonna be a while.
Me and Jimmy King don't lose.

34:00.901 --> 34:03.165
Down with King?
Big Jimmy King fan?

34:03.970 --> 34:05.403
King is king.

34:06.106 --> 34:07.334
Bullshit what happened.

34:07.707 --> 34:11.074
Makes me wanna puke. But my dad
says puking's for pussies.

34:11.844 --> 34:14.574
I puke all the time
and I'm not a pussy.

34:17.484 --> 34:19.952
Listen, me and my associate...

34:20.152 --> 34:22.085
...we're on a quest to find King.

34:22.288 --> 34:24.119
You know where his mansion is?

34:24.590 --> 34:27.956
I heard he lives in a castle.
I never seen it, though.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.786
I could probably find it.

34:30.029 --> 34:31.860
You can find Jimmy King?

34:32.565 --> 34:34.556
I can find anyone on the Net.

34:35.467 --> 34:38.527
I'll search the Web for info
on King's whereabouts.

34:38.771 --> 34:39.829
Good. Smart.

34:40.438 --> 34:41.996
You're the King!

34:42.241 --> 34:46.177
- Oh, yeah? I will rule you!
- Dude.

34:46.379 --> 34:48.108
Dude, my dad'll hear you.

34:48.581 --> 34:50.379
Sorry, man. I'll keep it down.

34:50.784 --> 34:51.751
Thanks.

34:53.152 --> 34:55.143
Give it to you two times!

34:55.688 --> 34:56.815
Sorry.

34:58.658 --> 35:01.684
I found a site. "King, Jimmy.

35:02.596 --> 35:04.188
Wife, Eugenia."

35:05.599 --> 35:07.362
Hey, and you're in luck.

35:08.368 --> 35:09.960
Here's the address.

35:11.638 --> 35:13.765
Sir Isaac,
you've served your king well.

35:14.174 --> 35:17.701
My loneliness is killing me

35:19.279 --> 35:23.181
I must confess I still believe

35:28.154 --> 35:31.089
Give me a sign

35:31.892 --> 35:34.587
Hit me baby one more time

35:38.063 --> 35:40.361
It's not exactly a castle.

35:52.578 --> 35:54.102
Eugenia King?

35:55.014 --> 35:57.141
- Jimmy King's wife?
- Yeah.

35:57.950 --> 35:58.974
The queen.

36:00.119 --> 36:01.347
Front and present.

36:03.956 --> 36:06.390
We're looking for the King.
Is he home?

36:06.592 --> 36:09.618
What are you, high?
He hasn't been home in two years.

36:09.895 --> 36:13.296
All I got to remember him by
is an itchy crotch.

36:13.833 --> 36:15.767
You ever seen crabs up close?

36:16.469 --> 36:17.436
You wanna see?

36:19.005 --> 36:21.269
- Fantastic.
- Wait, no.

36:22.609 --> 36:23.507
I got this.

36:23.677 --> 36:25.167
Ma'am...

36:26.179 --> 36:28.409
...could you say who
his associates are?

36:28.582 --> 36:32.018
Yeah. They're all scumbags.
You could try Louise.

36:33.787 --> 36:35.277
And Louise is...?

36:35.488 --> 36:36.750
A whore. She's a whore.

36:37.223 --> 36:38.986
Good. Whores.

36:39.192 --> 36:42.684
Scumbags and whores. Great.
Thank you. You've been a lot of help.

36:42.963 --> 36:44.055
If you find him...

36:44.297 --> 36:48.027
...tell him he owes me child support,
alimony and dental bills.

36:49.868 --> 36:53.497
Tell him I hope his diddly turns black
and falls in the crapper.

36:57.309 --> 36:58.776
It's the prince.

37:07.353 --> 37:08.786
You looking for my dad?

37:09.054 --> 37:11.522
Yeah. We're on a quest.
Prince Jimmy!

37:11.790 --> 37:12.882
I'm Frankie.

37:13.759 --> 37:15.283
Are you bounty hunters?

37:16.095 --> 37:19.189
I'll help you find him
if you split the reward with me.

37:19.431 --> 37:21.365
- Know where we can find him?
- No.

37:21.967 --> 37:23.662
I haven't seen him for months.

37:24.169 --> 37:26.137
Mama says he's gotta pay
for my braces...

37:26.338 --> 37:28.898
...otherwise they're gonna
repossess them.

37:29.441 --> 37:30.806
Nice.

37:32.945 --> 37:35.243
My research shows he has three kids...

37:35.447 --> 37:39.144
...two illegitimate, two wives
and has filed for bankruptcy 3 times.

37:39.351 --> 37:42.912
This doesn't make sense!
Jimmy King wouldn't do that stuff!

37:43.156 --> 37:44.714
It's a conspiracy, all right?

37:44.991 --> 37:49.394
Sinclair set up King to make him
lose face in front of his own family.

37:49.596 --> 37:52.565
And I found his parents.
Maybe they can help.

37:52.732 --> 37:54.597
Kid's wasted his entire life.

37:55.468 --> 37:56.765
Wrestling.

37:57.971 --> 38:00.461
He could have been a doctor.

38:01.974 --> 38:05.375
Well, an ambulance driver, at least.

38:05.577 --> 38:07.943
Jimmy was never very bright.

38:08.147 --> 38:09.739
Left school in 10th grade.

38:10.015 --> 38:11.539
I beg to differ.

38:12.351 --> 38:16.845
According to his authorized biography,
King worked very hard in high school.

38:17.122 --> 38:21.388
And after you died in a plane crash,
he went to community college.

38:21.593 --> 38:24.221
And he supported you
while he held two jobs.

38:25.064 --> 38:28.397
I ought to kick your ass, freak!

38:29.601 --> 38:30.898
We saw him last week.

38:31.804 --> 38:34.671
He came and "borrowed" our motor home.

38:34.873 --> 38:39.310
We haven't seen him since.
The big shit!

38:39.578 --> 38:43.742
Yes. Jimmy King received a speeding
ticket, driving a motor home.

38:43.982 --> 38:47.145
He gave them an address.
St. Francis Motor Court.

38:47.352 --> 38:49.820
- Space 14.
- Get off the phone, you pussy!

38:50.089 --> 38:53.616
I gotta go. My dad says yakking
on the phone is for pussies.

39:14.113 --> 39:17.412
Let's go. That's not the King,
just some weird lady.

39:17.583 --> 39:18.709
Oh, my God.

39:20.853 --> 39:21.820
That's her.

39:22.688 --> 39:25.316
I mean, that's him. That's the King.

39:29.895 --> 39:32.159
Are you telling me the King's a queen?

39:32.731 --> 39:37.327
There's gotta be an explanation.
But we came all this way.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.237
He needs us.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.903
It's another plot. A "rouge."

39:45.811 --> 39:49.577
- King! Jimmy King?
- Yeah, baby.

39:50.549 --> 39:52.244
Jimmy King!

39:55.988 --> 39:58.786
- Who's there? Who's there?
- It's us.

40:02.828 --> 40:04.853
The nice boys from the pharmacy.

40:05.130 --> 40:09.191
Leave my husband's medicine on the top
step. I'll tip you next time...

40:09.434 --> 40:13.200
- No, no. No pharmacy.
- We're your most loyal "surgeons."

40:13.405 --> 40:15.464
- Why are you doing this?
- It's us!

40:15.674 --> 40:18.575
- You're a chick?
- Give me the stuff or I'll crown you!

40:18.744 --> 40:21.406
- It's him!
- It's him! King!

40:21.613 --> 40:22.671
Jimmy King!

40:23.615 --> 40:25.411
We're your biggest fans.

40:26.184 --> 40:28.345
- You're fans?
- Yeah.

40:30.288 --> 40:32.688
I ought to break your geeky necks.

40:33.658 --> 40:36.092
We're on a quest
to restore your throne!

40:36.294 --> 40:38.854
- We believe in you, Jimmy King!
- Piss off!

40:42.000 --> 40:42.830
There's hope.

40:43.569 --> 40:46.037
See, he's got some fight left in him.

40:46.405 --> 40:49.966
Could we come in? Five minutes
is all we ask of the King.

40:50.242 --> 40:51.231
Please?

40:51.610 --> 40:53.510
How much money you got?

40:57.049 --> 40:59.176
- Thirty dollars.
- Show it to me.

41:06.325 --> 41:07.849
Personal appearance fee.

41:08.126 --> 41:10.720
Thirty dollars, five minutes. Enter!

41:14.032 --> 41:15.795
- You were right.
- I told you.

41:16.702 --> 41:18.670
Things happen for a reason.

41:31.383 --> 41:35.319
It's a conspiracy. We know
this isn't you. You're our king.

41:35.888 --> 41:39.653
This is a disguise. I'm hiding out
from a couple of people.

41:39.857 --> 41:41.950
You're hiding out from Sinclair.

41:42.894 --> 41:45.260
I ain't scared of that circus freak.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.325
You understand me?

41:47.531 --> 41:51.092
I made that league and he knows it.
I put the butts in the seats.

41:51.402 --> 41:53.097
- I know.
- He's done exploiting me...

41:53.337 --> 41:58.206
...so he plots a massacre with his
sissies and kicks me out for good.

41:58.409 --> 42:00.502
- That's so unjust.
- That sucks.

42:00.711 --> 42:04.442
It's not like the rest of my life
been a bowl of cherries either.

42:05.617 --> 42:09.519
But I just try and play
the cards that's dealt me.

42:10.589 --> 42:12.580
Keep my chin up.

42:13.258 --> 42:16.785
Even though my wife just left me...

42:17.829 --> 42:20.593
...and my little boy's
confined to a wheelchair.

42:22.134 --> 42:24.602
And my mommy and daddy just passed.

42:27.606 --> 42:28.573
We met your wife.

42:30.142 --> 42:32.372
And she says that you left her.

42:33.879 --> 42:35.244
Not how I remember it.

42:36.515 --> 42:38.710
And your son's not in a wheelchair.

42:40.953 --> 42:43.148
Your parents aren't dead anymore.

42:43.588 --> 42:46.386
Good Lord! I am blessed!

42:46.591 --> 42:49.320
Praise Him, in all His mercies!

42:49.527 --> 42:52.087
Piss off! Five minutes are up.
Get out!

42:53.230 --> 42:54.162
Wait.

42:54.432 --> 42:55.797
- Get out!
- Wait, wait.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.558
Can we do something for you?

42:57.802 --> 43:01.704
We can go on a beer run, right?
We can go on a beer run for you.

43:01.906 --> 43:03.396
Beer is good. Beer.

43:08.045 --> 43:09.444
Get me two sixes.

43:11.382 --> 43:15.546
You try and skip out with my money,
I'm gonna find you...

43:16.887 --> 43:18.514
"I will find you..."

43:19.924 --> 43:21.983
"I will find you" and...?

43:24.161 --> 43:26.152
- "I will rule you!"
- Yeah.

43:26.797 --> 43:29.061
Give us a "rule you," please?

43:29.300 --> 43:30.733
- Wait, no.
- Come on!

43:30.968 --> 43:32.868
Give us a "begone."

43:33.070 --> 43:35.038
Yeah, please?

43:35.273 --> 43:36.365
How about this:

43:36.575 --> 43:38.873
Go get my damn beer,
you frigging morons!

43:41.947 --> 43:45.212
- How are we gonna get back to Lusk?
- What do you mean?

43:46.885 --> 43:48.580
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

43:48.787 --> 43:51.688
Drunk Jimmy King in a dress.
We're out of here.

43:51.890 --> 43:54.688
Wait, no, no. Sean, we can't.

43:54.893 --> 43:56.986
He needs us now more than ever.

43:58.597 --> 43:59.689
My hope...

43:59.931 --> 44:04.629
...is that you two figured out that
I ain't the fella you came to see.

44:05.870 --> 44:08.202
It's been a pleasure sitting with you.

44:08.439 --> 44:11.772
Thank you for getting me
two boxes of beer.

44:11.976 --> 44:13.705
Shut the door on your way out.

44:13.911 --> 44:16.209
I know what's going on here.

44:16.447 --> 44:18.608
You need to get back into the ring.

44:18.816 --> 44:20.044
Never happen.

44:20.251 --> 44:24.950
Sinclair created and owns
my character. It's over. Cheers.

44:25.156 --> 44:27.681
Sinclair?
So what? You're the King.

44:28.492 --> 44:30.357
You can beat anyone.

44:33.364 --> 44:35.594
- Beat anyone?
- Yeah.

44:36.834 --> 44:38.461
Y'all know it's just a show?

44:39.070 --> 44:40.594
Best show in the world.

44:40.838 --> 44:42.738
It's like dancing, you know?

44:43.340 --> 44:45.865
- It's a circus show with dancing.
- Right.

44:46.110 --> 44:47.509
- Dancing clowns.
- We got you.

44:47.678 --> 44:48.770
Honk, honk.

44:49.413 --> 44:51.347
A little soap opera thrown in.

44:51.549 --> 44:54.848
This clown just got fired, that's all.
No more wrestling.

44:58.522 --> 45:00.422
Listen to me, you dumbshits!

45:00.591 --> 45:03.219
I ain't no king!
There never was no king!

45:03.495 --> 45:07.864
The King is a fake creation.
I ain't a has-been. I'm a never-was.

45:08.066 --> 45:10.466
You got it, stupid?

45:10.635 --> 45:14.161
Now, get the hell out of my house!
I'm done with you. Get out!

45:15.573 --> 45:16.562
Come on.

45:18.709 --> 45:20.142
Get. Get out.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.478
Know what I don't get?

45:33.490 --> 45:35.583
How can you be phony
if we believe in you?

45:37.727 --> 45:41.561
We need you, King.
Your fans need you.

45:42.298 --> 45:45.461
We need you to rise above this
and take Sinclair down.

45:46.202 --> 45:49.069
I wouldn't mind taking a swing
at that turd bump.

45:49.272 --> 45:53.641
That's what we're talking about.
You'll get as many swings as you want.

45:53.843 --> 45:56.243
I'm a little banged up.
I don't know.

45:56.479 --> 45:59.778
Oh, please! You fought
with a broken back before.

45:59.983 --> 46:03.976
You were paralyzed, you hopped out
of a wheelchair and whupped Canyon!

46:05.355 --> 46:08.552
Sting broke six bones
in your neck with a bat.

46:08.725 --> 46:10.920
In two weeks, you came back and ruled!

46:11.794 --> 46:14.888
- Come on!
- Come on, man! This is nothing!

46:16.266 --> 46:17.665
What's the matter?

46:19.102 --> 46:20.694
Come on! This is nothing!

46:21.538 --> 46:23.733
- Let go!
- Show us some of that old King!

46:23.940 --> 46:26.238
- Let go or...
- Or what? Or what?

46:27.843 --> 46:29.868
Or I will rule you!

46:43.693 --> 46:44.591
Crown us!

46:44.794 --> 46:45.818
Crown us, come on!

46:46.062 --> 46:48.553
- Please, crown us!
- Crown us!

46:50.633 --> 46:53.124
That was great, man!

46:53.369 --> 46:54.893
You happy now?

47:04.681 --> 47:06.706
Wakey, wakey, hands off snakey.

47:08.051 --> 47:09.541
- Guess what?
- What?

47:09.852 --> 47:13.788
Taking you up on your offer to get
one good swing at Titus Sinclair.

47:13.990 --> 47:15.787
You're gonna pound Sinclair?

47:16.826 --> 47:19.351
Oh, yeah. I'm driving first leg.

47:58.434 --> 48:00.629
Here tonight, in a hard-core match...

48:01.004 --> 48:03.734
...Sid Vicious is gonna
be locking up with Sting.

48:03.973 --> 48:08.069
Plus in his very first title offense,
Diamond Dallas Page...

48:08.311 --> 48:12.338
...faces none other than the Disco
Inferno. Should be interesting.

48:14.817 --> 48:15.875
Out of the way!

48:16.419 --> 48:18.649
- Excuse us!
- Smells like poop in here.

48:19.022 --> 48:20.819
We're almost in position.

48:21.057 --> 48:24.151
When we have access to Sinclair,
Gordie will call.

48:29.365 --> 48:32.596
When you hear that, jump out
and we'll have our meeting.

48:34.470 --> 48:36.062
Sit tight, King.

48:36.306 --> 48:39.469
Have you back on that throne
in no time. Come on.

48:44.881 --> 48:46.508
Here, girls.
Here, here, here.

48:46.749 --> 48:48.216
Oh, my goodness!

48:49.852 --> 48:51.012
- Look!
- Naked things.

48:54.723 --> 48:56.782
The naked, naked things.

48:59.594 --> 49:02.688
- All the naked things.
- Naked. Naked.

49:04.633 --> 49:06.157
Oh, extra-naked.

49:13.775 --> 49:15.174
Excuse me.

49:15.410 --> 49:16.377
Boys.

49:17.446 --> 49:18.538
Can I help you?

49:18.814 --> 49:21.408
No. We were just
checking out your breasts.

49:23.385 --> 49:25.444
We're checking the pipes in the wall.

49:25.688 --> 49:28.156
See, they're round and large.

49:28.358 --> 49:29.757
Well, thanks.

49:34.897 --> 49:38.765
That was Sasha. Perhaps the
Nitro-est Nitro Girl of them all.

49:48.945 --> 49:51.812
Mr. Page? Got 60 seconds.

49:52.048 --> 49:56.508
I want to start tight on the belt,
then reveal us, pulling back.

49:56.753 --> 49:58.243
About time you put it on me.

49:58.488 --> 50:00.456
Anybody's better than Jimmy King.

50:01.657 --> 50:04.182
Ungrateful tub of lard,
that's what he was.

50:04.427 --> 50:07.156
I know that. You know that.

50:07.396 --> 50:09.796
I don't get what
these kids dig about him.

50:10.165 --> 50:13.293
Let me tell you about these kids.
They're morons.

50:13.535 --> 50:15.400
They love who I tell them to.

50:15.604 --> 50:20.166
"I'm Jimmy King! I will rule you!

50:20.409 --> 50:22.502
I will reign supreme!

50:23.211 --> 50:26.339
As soon as I finish
these here beers."

50:26.882 --> 50:27.849
Funny?

50:28.116 --> 50:29.515
Let's roll. We'll do it.

50:29.751 --> 50:32.845
Five. Four. Three. Two.

50:34.089 --> 50:37.252
Page, what do you really feel
about Jimmy King?

50:37.492 --> 50:39.016
Yo, snapper-head, up here!

50:39.594 --> 50:43.052
Jimmy King, he doesn't know
a wristlock from a wristwatch.

50:43.265 --> 50:45.460
As far as being
in shape is concerned...

50:45.700 --> 50:49.602
...that boy was so out of shape,
in the ring it was like fighting...

50:49.871 --> 50:52.431
...a harpooned whale.

50:52.641 --> 50:54.632
That's sweet, man. What a bum.

50:54.911 --> 50:56.208
Jimmy King is not a...

50:57.580 --> 50:59.207
I ain't no damn bum!

51:07.190 --> 51:08.953
King's not in the script!

51:24.139 --> 51:25.197
Foreign object!

51:32.280 --> 51:34.544
Fatty just made you
his shithouse bitch!

51:40.121 --> 51:41.520
Who are you guys?

51:41.756 --> 51:43.690
- We're fans!
- Jimmy King's, asshole!

51:43.925 --> 51:45.984
Get them off of me!

51:59.608 --> 52:00.575
King!

52:03.578 --> 52:05.375
Is that all you got?

52:15.123 --> 52:17.421
- Do your job!
- You went down!

52:17.893 --> 52:20.623
One. Two. Three.

52:20.897 --> 52:23.263
The winner by pinfall, Jimmy King!

52:23.733 --> 52:25.223
We have a new champion!

52:25.434 --> 52:27.402
Jimmy King rules!

52:30.539 --> 52:31.563
No!

52:32.307 --> 52:33.740
That was unsanctioned!

52:33.975 --> 52:38.139
And per the bylaws of the WCW,
that belt cannot be passed.

52:38.380 --> 52:42.373
- You give me what's mine, you freak!
- You can't ambush your opponent.

52:42.584 --> 52:45.417
- Any match, anytime, baby!
- You heard him.

52:45.620 --> 52:47.679
Any match, anytime!

52:47.956 --> 52:50.686
You want a match, you got one match.

52:50.959 --> 52:53.223
- One match, you name it!
- The steel cage.

52:53.461 --> 52:55.759
Steel cage? Done! When?

52:56.031 --> 52:58.898
- He doesn't even have to win.
- He's not gonna win.

52:59.768 --> 53:02.931
- No, he's gonna win.
- All you have to do is survive.

53:03.638 --> 53:07.540
You survive and you get this belt.

53:08.977 --> 53:10.137
Plus $1 million!

53:10.979 --> 53:12.469
But if he loses...

53:13.281 --> 53:16.739
...you forfeit your crown
and never be able to wrestle again.

53:17.018 --> 53:19.145
- It's a deal!
- You got a match, baby!

53:19.387 --> 53:21.912
Hold on, baby. Hold the damn phones.

53:22.591 --> 53:24.855
Ladies and gentlemen,
you heard it here.

53:25.093 --> 53:29.553
A new first. Four weeks from tonight,
MGM Grand, pay-per-view.

53:30.265 --> 53:33.666
- Be there!
- We're gonna reign supreme!

53:33.935 --> 53:37.871
- Good, save it! Save that emotion!
- Save it!

53:38.106 --> 53:40.074
Tonight we rejoice! We rejoice!

53:40.275 --> 53:43.038
- With the King in his motor castle!
- Party!

53:56.391 --> 53:57.449
Sasha.

53:58.026 --> 53:58.993
Oh, my God.

54:02.897 --> 54:03.829
I'm Gordie.

54:04.466 --> 54:06.457
I saw you in that brawl tonight.

54:07.235 --> 54:08.896
Pretty awesome.

54:12.407 --> 54:13.601
Got a beer?

54:15.844 --> 54:17.812
- Dick!
- Thanks.

54:19.681 --> 54:22.013
I got your poster up in my room.

54:22.250 --> 54:23.217
Really?

54:23.852 --> 54:24.648
Which one?

54:24.919 --> 54:25.977
Is it...

54:27.255 --> 54:29.246
...this one? Or wait.

54:31.559 --> 54:33.993
- That one?
- No, it's this one.

54:37.632 --> 54:39.862
- That's my favorite.
- Me too!

54:41.703 --> 54:43.330
You're really sweet.

54:45.507 --> 54:46.872
And masculine.

54:47.142 --> 54:49.702
I really like how
you stood up to Sinclair.

54:49.978 --> 54:52.503
We did it for that guy right there.

54:54.182 --> 54:55.409
Isn't he the best?

54:55.616 --> 54:57.880
He's the best. There's no better.

54:59.720 --> 55:03.884
Growing up in Cody, Wyoming,
I lived to watch Jimmy King fight.

55:04.158 --> 55:06.217
You're from Cody? No way!

55:06.460 --> 55:09.224
- I'm from Lusk!
- Really?

55:09.463 --> 55:10.452
Oh, my God!

55:12.399 --> 55:13.366
You wanna dance?

55:35.657 --> 55:37.818
Do people think I'm sexy?

55:38.493 --> 55:41.792
I think you're sexy, Gene.
Really I do.

55:45.300 --> 55:49.600
But right now, I'm gonna train
for this freaking death match, baby.

55:50.105 --> 55:53.939
A little pure protein,
send me on my way.

56:05.186 --> 56:07.245
No goddamn way, baby!

56:23.349 --> 56:24.316
Oh, my God.

56:26.219 --> 56:27.982
How'd you know
where to find him?

56:28.857 --> 56:30.518
We're in the business.

56:30.894 --> 56:34.091
Found him in drainage tunnel 14.
He didn't want to leave.

56:34.566 --> 56:36.329
We'll take care of him from here.

56:36.569 --> 56:37.763
Good luck.

56:39.207 --> 56:40.504
Do your magic.

56:42.512 --> 56:44.980
You cannot run away.

56:45.217 --> 56:47.481
You got a fight,
major responsibilities.

56:47.755 --> 56:49.120
I got news for you.

56:49.324 --> 56:52.157
I sucker-punched Page last night.
It was a fluke!

56:52.362 --> 56:54.057
How can you say that?

56:54.499 --> 56:56.057
We got you this far!

56:57.237 --> 56:59.330
We're gonna get you a trainer.

56:59.774 --> 57:01.139
Trainer?

57:01.877 --> 57:04.903
I don't need a trainer.
I need a safe house, baby.

57:05.149 --> 57:08.312
Or a new identity from the FBI.
Or a fast car.

57:08.988 --> 57:13.288
Jimmy King is not scared.
Jimmy King does not back down.

57:13.529 --> 57:14.791
Don't you get it?

57:15.031 --> 57:18.489
Sinclair wants to kill me.
End my life.

57:18.804 --> 57:23.706
So I'm dead and buried in the ground.
Little tiny bugs feasting on my ass.

57:23.944 --> 57:26.242
No bugs are gonna feast on your ass!

57:26.482 --> 57:30.248
You'll win the money and get
your belt back. That's our mission.

57:31.323 --> 57:33.086
I'm scared, baby. I'm scared.

57:33.593 --> 57:36.562
We can help. Sean, sing the song.

57:36.999 --> 57:38.125
I don't want to sing.

57:38.334 --> 57:41.701
Sing the song for Mr. King! Come on.

57:45.112 --> 57:48.275
Jimmy King is the best wrestler

57:48.517 --> 57:50.178
He's the best-ler

57:50.387 --> 57:52.947
Better than all the rest-ler

57:53.191 --> 57:54.920
- He's got class
- He's really fast

57:55.161 --> 57:58.562
- He'll rule ass
- He'll rule that ass

57:59.769 --> 58:03.432
Jimmy, Jimmy King

58:03.675 --> 58:05.939
- It's not done.
- We're still working on it.

58:10.919 --> 58:12.250
Where are you taking me?

58:12.456 --> 58:14.754
It's a surprise. Don't worry.

58:22.038 --> 58:23.471
Hello?

58:25.877 --> 58:27.504
What the hell is that, baby?

58:38.664 --> 58:41.633
I got three words for you, baby,
9-1-1.

58:47.144 --> 58:48.168
Stifle!

59:01.233 --> 59:02.598
Sal Bandini.

59:02.835 --> 59:04.325
Wanna wrestle?

59:04.571 --> 59:05.367
Sal Bandini?

59:06.741 --> 59:07.935
This is an honor...

59:13.552 --> 59:14.576
Tap out, son.

59:18.360 --> 59:20.385
This is who you called about?

59:20.964 --> 59:21.896
I've seen you.

59:22.634 --> 59:25.762
You're big, tough. You don't
know shit about wrestling.

59:26.039 --> 59:29.475
Always worried, what,
about TV time and endorsements?

59:29.712 --> 59:31.646
- Well...
- Stifle. You talk too much.

59:31.848 --> 59:34.316
Mr. Bandini, he's ready
to listen and learn.

59:34.553 --> 59:38.683
Good. I'm just finishing up with
the local high school wrestling team.

59:40.830 --> 59:42.661
All right, whackers, go home.

59:42.900 --> 59:44.367
You did real good today.

59:44.570 --> 59:46.764
But remember what I told you.

59:47.039 --> 59:50.440
Apply pressure until
you hear cartilage snap...

59:50.678 --> 59:53.442
...or they crap in their pants.
Come on, wuss, move it!

59:53.683 --> 59:56.049
And you, work on that for tomorrow!

59:56.488 --> 59:59.821
Gentlemen, step into my office.

01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:02.458
Just take it easy.

01:00:03.097 --> 01:00:04.394
Come on, Jimmy.

01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:06.464
Show me one of your fancy moves.

01:00:09.875 --> 01:00:10.842
Come on, King.

01:00:14.182 --> 01:00:16.776
- That's not good.
- Come on. It's embarrassing.

01:00:19.257 --> 01:00:21.919
Tap out, punk.
I seen you favor that leg.

01:00:22.195 --> 01:00:24.629
Lesson one:
Never reveal your weaknesses.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.428
Bite me, old man.

01:00:26.668 --> 01:00:27.692
Right spirit.

01:00:27.937 --> 01:00:29.996
Wrong old man to be messing with.

01:00:30.275 --> 01:00:31.242
Tap out.

01:00:39.858 --> 01:00:41.917
You kicked him in the face, King.

01:00:42.196 --> 01:00:44.391
The crazy old bastard was
gonna kill me.

01:00:44.632 --> 01:00:45.963
I think you killed him.

01:00:46.235 --> 01:00:47.202
What?

01:00:47.537 --> 01:00:49.596
How hard did you hit him?
He's an old man!

01:00:49.842 --> 01:00:51.332
Only gave him a little flick.

01:00:51.544 --> 01:00:53.944
No, you kicked him in the face.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.184
Sal, you all right?
You all right, baby?

01:01:06.134 --> 01:01:07.726
You know, kicking me was right.

01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:09.735
Seeing if I was okay is wrong.

01:01:10.543 --> 01:01:15.344
Lesson one: The possum ain't dead
till it's scraped off the road.

01:01:15.552 --> 01:01:17.144
It's treachery.

01:01:17.623 --> 01:01:19.386
Did you have to squash
the possum's nuts?

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:20.650
Stifle.

01:01:26.371 --> 01:01:28.339
Buenos nachos, señorita.

01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:31.108
I didn't know you spoke Spanish.

01:01:31.512 --> 01:01:33.207
Yeah, I took it in high school.

01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:34.576
A bunch of times.

01:01:35.986 --> 01:01:37.385
Are you fluent?

01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:40.581
No. I feel fine.

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.727
Got something for you.

01:01:47.439 --> 01:01:48.872
Thanks.

01:01:49.442 --> 01:01:53.139
Flower guy was closed,
so I picked those up for you.

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:54.417
Great.

01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:56.311
Come on in.

01:01:58.224 --> 01:02:00.488
Candles and food and everything.

01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:02.390
Yeah. I figured, why go out?

01:02:03.334 --> 01:02:04.767
We can stay in.

01:02:13.383 --> 01:02:15.510
So how's training going?

01:02:16.287 --> 01:02:17.481
Pretty good.

01:02:18.459 --> 01:02:21.951
Got him a coach, he's starting
to listen. Things are looking up.

01:02:22.498 --> 01:02:24.398
A coach? Really?

01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:25.863
Do I know him?

01:02:27.941 --> 01:02:29.568
Sal Bandini. You heard of him?

01:02:31.213 --> 01:02:33.010
No, I don't think I know him.

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:34.806
He's old school.

01:02:35.721 --> 01:02:36.915
Yeah, he's a real pro.

01:02:37.358 --> 01:02:39.622
Kind of been training alongside him...

01:02:39.862 --> 01:02:43.320
...so picking up some really,
really awesome moves.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.961
Awesome moves, huh?

01:02:48.476 --> 01:02:51.070
I'd love you to show me
your awesome moves.

01:02:56.123 --> 01:02:57.784
Show me what you got, big boy.

01:02:58.794 --> 01:03:01.194
Well, I got some moves for you.

01:03:04.738 --> 01:03:05.705
Are you sure?

01:03:06.641 --> 01:03:08.108
I'm sure.

01:03:14.755 --> 01:03:15.813
That was a snap-mare.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.260
Take me to the bedroom.

01:03:22.869 --> 01:03:25.496
I meant, why don't we wrestle in here?

01:03:25.738 --> 01:03:27.205
Bedroom match.

01:03:27.777 --> 01:03:29.836
I'd love to wrestle you in here.

01:03:31.048 --> 01:03:32.515
Give it to me, big boy.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.061
I will now unveil my...

01:03:44.303 --> 01:03:46.168
...secret weapons.

01:03:48.512 --> 01:03:49.877
Foreign objects!

01:03:53.854 --> 01:03:55.321
Oh, God!

01:03:58.962 --> 01:04:01.328
Dear Dad: I am fine.

01:04:01.566 --> 01:04:06.469
Sean and I are helping Jimmy King
reclaim his lost glory.

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:10.638
King's a good man who just
seems to have lost his way.

01:04:10.883 --> 01:04:13.647
Also, Dad, I met this
really, really sweet girl.

01:04:13.889 --> 01:04:16.187
And I'm not a virgin anymore.

01:04:16.961 --> 01:04:19.828
Sorry about missing
the state trooper's exam.

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:23.831
I'm sure there's another one coming up
that you can force me to take.

01:04:32.921 --> 01:04:35.253
Respectfully, Gordon.

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:39.551
Sweetie, I don't think King needs
any other wrestlers.

01:04:39.799 --> 01:04:42.529
- I think it's a bad idea.
- You think so, boopie?

01:04:43.238 --> 01:04:44.705
Maybe we shouldn't do it.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.340
Boopie thinks it's a bad idea.
We shouldn't do it.

01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:50.241
I think that boopie
should keep her mouth shut.

01:04:50.516 --> 01:04:52.643
- Don't talk to boopie like that.
- I'm telling you...

01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:55.720
...I have a terrible vibe
about this whole thing.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.623
Listen. You need a posse of guys
who are gonna support you.

01:05:01.002 --> 01:05:03.095
There he is. Come on.

01:05:07.045 --> 01:05:09.946
Oh, hey, Big Bill!
Goldberg, what are you doing?

01:05:10.183 --> 01:05:12.879
I didn't know you were in town.
You're looking good.

01:05:13.123 --> 01:05:15.489
What's going on? Why are you here?

01:05:15.726 --> 01:05:17.353
I'm doing Letterman.

01:05:17.596 --> 01:05:20.622
What are you doing here?
Preparing for your execution?

01:05:22.938 --> 01:05:24.929
- You think I have no chance?
- Get real.

01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:28.508
Sinclair's pissed off,
and he'll make an example out of you.

01:05:28.747 --> 01:05:31.978
Face it. You're a second-rate
wrestler and a third-rate man.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.848
You're still sore about
that spot I blew in Akron.

01:05:35.459 --> 01:05:36.448
You were drunk.

01:05:36.695 --> 01:05:39.687
I'm sorry. I was having
terrible back spasms that day.

01:05:39.933 --> 01:05:40.957
You puked on me.

01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:42.930
The audience liked it.

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.161
I was your partner!

01:05:46.577 --> 01:05:49.374
I made you. If it wasn't for me,
you'd be nothing.

01:05:49.547 --> 01:05:50.536
Yeah?

01:05:52.418 --> 01:05:53.407
Damn.

01:05:53.954 --> 01:05:56.855
Mr. Goldberg, that was a nice throw.
How you doing?

01:05:57.059 --> 01:05:59.994
We represent Mr. King
in his upcoming pay-per-view.

01:06:00.231 --> 01:06:03.166
You are the mack. You are it, man!

01:06:03.403 --> 01:06:05.303
His majesty needs you in the corner.

01:06:05.539 --> 01:06:08.440
Look, I used to look up to Jimmy
just like you two.

01:06:08.945 --> 01:06:11.743
But the fact is, he let me down.

01:06:11.983 --> 01:06:14.645
I know. I know. King lost his way.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:17.219
But he has seen the light.
He's a changed man.

01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:18.823
The change is coming!

01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:20.790
Please, for a second...?

01:06:21.464 --> 01:06:24.092
Whatever's happened in the past
is the past.

01:06:24.336 --> 01:06:26.566
But ultimately,
he's your friend, right?

01:06:26.806 --> 01:06:30.572
And you can't turn your back
on a friend. Right?

01:06:31.013 --> 01:06:34.505
Sorry, guys.
The fact is, I work alone.

01:07:17.186 --> 01:07:18.016
That's him.

01:07:32.444 --> 01:07:34.105
Sal Bandini. Want to wrestle?

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.698
Who's your daddy, bitch?

01:07:53.244 --> 01:07:54.211
Who sent you?

01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:56.140
Sinclair.

01:07:57.083 --> 01:07:59.381
He wants you to stay away from King.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:02.418
You tell your boss
I'll train whoever I want.

01:08:13.643 --> 01:08:15.667
I'm so sorry, Gordie.

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:18.147
It's not your fault, Sasha.

01:08:18.917 --> 01:08:20.042
Poor Sal.

01:08:21.787 --> 01:08:23.653
Mr. Bandini's a tough old man.

01:08:24.158 --> 01:08:27.492
But he'll have to stay here a while.
He's got multiple injuries.

01:08:29.568 --> 01:08:30.660
Any questions?

01:08:30.904 --> 01:08:32.269
- Can we see him?
- Sure.

01:08:33.407 --> 01:08:35.170
I'm gonna get him a Butterfinger.

01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:37.674
I have to use the little girls' room.

01:08:44.192 --> 01:08:46.057
Can I have a Butterfinger too?

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:51.468
It's over.

01:08:51.703 --> 01:08:52.692
It's done.

01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:54.803
Now can I please get out of here?

01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.502
Sasha, take it easy.
You did good.

01:08:57.846 --> 01:09:00.680
Titus, I'm wasting my time
at the hospital.

01:09:00.952 --> 01:09:03.819
Poor guy should be in the morgue
after what you guys did.

01:09:05.325 --> 01:09:06.553
Who do you wuv?

01:09:07.595 --> 01:09:09.392
I wuv you.

01:09:11.468 --> 01:09:14.095
Now, please, just get me out of here.

01:09:14.339 --> 01:09:17.206
Bandini guy's like
100 years old, anyway.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:18.569
105.

01:09:19.346 --> 01:09:22.475
But tell that to
Saturn and Sid Vicious over here.

01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:23.981
Morons.

01:09:25.657 --> 01:09:27.020
You did great.

01:09:27.259 --> 01:09:31.194
So how does head Nitro Girl sound?

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.560
My balls are in my throat...

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:37.127
...my prostate is the size
of a melon...

01:09:37.508 --> 01:09:40.102
...and I'm crapping tapioca.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.910
I feel like a kid again.

01:09:45.321 --> 01:09:47.687
Don't worry about me.
Sit down. Sit down.

01:09:51.631 --> 01:09:52.426
Listen to me.

01:09:52.666 --> 01:09:54.827
And this is the final lesson.

01:09:56.406 --> 01:09:58.636
Always attack a man's strengths.

01:09:59.344 --> 01:10:01.107
I think he means weaknesses.

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.047
No, I mean strengths.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:07.515
No one ever expects you to attack
the strongest part of the fort.

01:10:08.091 --> 01:10:09.422
Up the middle.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.628
That's where the action is.

01:10:12.165 --> 01:10:13.530
And it's the same in life.

01:10:14.568 --> 01:10:16.661
Look, I know you got demons.

01:10:17.173 --> 01:10:18.504
But don't run away.

01:10:18.742 --> 01:10:22.303
Attack them head on as
they're coming to you full speed.

01:10:22.548 --> 01:10:24.675
Because that, my friend...

01:10:24.885 --> 01:10:26.682
...is living.

01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:32.753
Got something for you, Sal.

01:10:33.365 --> 01:10:34.491
My favorite!

01:10:35.234 --> 01:10:37.998
- Thank you.
- Can we do anything for you?

01:10:38.473 --> 01:10:40.201
Get out of town.

01:10:40.843 --> 01:10:43.334
This place is no good for a wrestler.

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.138
Get back to basics.

01:10:45.751 --> 01:10:47.184
I know a place we can do that.

01:10:51.159 --> 01:10:52.626
Oh, man!

01:10:52.862 --> 01:10:54.887
This town turned my head around.

01:10:55.399 --> 01:10:57.833
Forgot our mission,
what was important.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:02.163
You know what? I'll do what it takes
from here on out to get the job done.

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:04.674
Yes, you are. And I am too.

01:11:06.617 --> 01:11:08.380
We're gonna get you that belt back.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.383
Man, I don't know, baby.

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:11.757
What?

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:13.259
What?

01:11:14.262 --> 01:11:16.389
What's the matter?
What did Sal just say?

01:11:16.633 --> 01:11:18.464
It's about what's in here!

01:11:20.305 --> 01:11:21.431
Dude...

01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:24.904
...you just crushed
my Butterfinger, baby.

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:27.171
Butterfinger?!

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.317
Get in the van now, okay?

01:11:29.554 --> 01:11:30.680
Sorry.

01:11:31.825 --> 01:11:34.350
Sorry, I had to make a call.

01:11:34.796 --> 01:11:36.093
How's Sal?

01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:38.424
- He's gonna make it.
- Oh, good.

01:11:41.473 --> 01:11:43.634
That's more than I can say for us.

01:11:44.344 --> 01:11:45.470
What's going on?

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.877
We're going back to basics.

01:11:48.117 --> 01:11:49.414
To find our heart.

01:11:49.786 --> 01:11:50.775
Well, can I come?

01:11:51.522 --> 01:11:54.081
No. Because you don't have one.

01:12:21.569 --> 01:12:23.799
I can't believe I met Goldberg.

01:12:24.307 --> 01:12:26.400
That's cool, you know?

01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:33.610
I know you don't wanna talk
about your fallout...

01:12:33.822 --> 01:12:35.187
You're right. I don't.

01:12:35.424 --> 01:12:38.291
- Look, I just...
- Mind your own business, all right?

01:12:43.037 --> 01:12:44.129
Where we going, King?

01:12:44.406 --> 01:12:46.340
There's something I gotta do.

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.344
Hello, Eugenia.

01:12:55.057 --> 01:12:56.081
Jimmy King.

01:12:59.364 --> 01:13:01.355
You are a bastard!

01:13:04.471 --> 01:13:05.699
Let me help you up.

01:13:07.242 --> 01:13:08.607
I guess I deserved that.

01:13:10.447 --> 01:13:12.745
I just had to kick you
in the diddly again.

01:13:15.922 --> 01:13:16.889
Jesus!

01:13:17.091 --> 01:13:19.389
Oh, the humanity. Make it stop.

01:13:23.068 --> 01:13:24.501
How's your diddly?

01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:26.704
Hope I broke it.

01:13:26.907 --> 01:13:28.841
It's definitely bruised.

01:13:29.477 --> 01:13:32.002
What the hell you thinking,
coming back here?

01:13:32.515 --> 01:13:33.641
I'm not exactly sure.

01:13:33.851 --> 01:13:36.285
I think that the King
is ready to be a man.

01:13:36.923 --> 01:13:38.823
Well, how does it feel?

01:13:39.593 --> 01:13:43.120
Like Richard Petty ran a stock car
into my balls...

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.368
...going 400 miles an hour.

01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:50.304
Well, look what the rat puked up.

01:13:50.544 --> 01:13:51.841
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:53.215 --> 01:13:55.775
You mean "cat," son, don't you?

01:13:55.986 --> 01:13:57.647
I ain't your son.

01:13:59.158 --> 01:14:00.216
Frankie...

01:14:01.461 --> 01:14:03.019
...I came to say I was sorry.

01:14:03.665 --> 01:14:04.927
Too late!

01:14:05.335 --> 01:14:07.530
Jesus, look at that grill!

01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:12.999
I mean, no, son. How you doing?
It's good to see...

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:16.715
Eugenia, please.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.854
I'm sorry that I took off on you...

01:14:21.093 --> 01:14:23.357
...when I should've been
taking care of you.

01:14:24.098 --> 01:14:25.861
Really. I'm really sorry.

01:14:27.303 --> 01:14:29.794
You can fry ice in hell, you bastard!

01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:33.943
What's the good in saying you're sorry?
What are you gonna do about it?

01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:35.045
What am I gonna do?

01:14:38.353 --> 01:14:41.186
Well, I'm gonna get that belt back.

01:14:41.392 --> 01:14:42.984
I'm gonna win $1 million.

01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:47.062
I'm gonna pay off all my debts.
I'm gonna do the right thing by you.

01:14:47.367 --> 01:14:48.925
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:55.577
And by God, I'm gonna get that boy
a damn good dentist.

01:15:09.269 --> 01:15:10.258
Yo, Sean!

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.431
Wyoming! We're home, baby.

01:15:15.112 --> 01:15:17.012
We're home, baby. Wyoming.

01:15:24.308 --> 01:15:25.935
No place like home.

01:15:27.493 --> 01:15:29.222
I can breathe out here.

01:15:40.794 --> 01:15:43.024
Approach the vehicle, son.

01:15:44.112 --> 01:15:45.306
Hi, Dad.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:46.447
No back talk.

01:15:47.199 --> 01:15:48.257
No excuses.

01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:50.374
Just get in the car.

01:15:56.824 --> 01:15:58.985
- What'd he do?
- Nothing.

01:16:04.799 --> 01:16:06.790
You're gonna be a cop, little mister.

01:16:07.035 --> 01:16:10.994
No skimpy outfits,
no touching other men.

01:16:11.672 --> 01:16:14.937
But I'm destined for other things.
I'm following my dream.

01:16:15.109 --> 01:16:16.667
Well, your dream is stupid!

01:16:16.944 --> 01:16:21.404
Just because it's your dream doesn't
make it right or noble or whatever.

01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:23.982
Charlie Manson was
following his dream.

01:16:24.186 --> 01:16:27.246
Joe Stalin, Michael Bolton...
You get my point?

01:16:48.876 --> 01:16:50.673
That's a 211, breaking and entering.

01:16:52.313 --> 01:16:55.009
Gordie, come on.
We need you, brother. Let's go.

01:16:57.051 --> 01:16:59.281
Gordie, we need you, baby.
I need you.

01:16:59.854 --> 01:17:01.651
I need you in my corner, man.

01:17:01.849 --> 01:17:04.147
I need you to help me pick my posse.

01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:07.134
I don't know if I can do this
without you.

01:17:08.369 --> 01:17:09.927
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:10.164 --> 01:17:11.131
You do?

01:17:11.636 --> 01:17:14.969
I need you to help us go down to Vegas
and rule ass! Let's go!

01:17:15.215 --> 01:17:16.614
Let's begone!

01:17:21.671 --> 01:17:22.695
I can't.

01:17:23.712 --> 01:17:26.374
I gotta study for this cop exam.

01:17:26.612 --> 01:17:27.579
My dad...

01:17:32.845 --> 01:17:35.507
It's your dream.
It's your dream. Come on.

01:17:40.248 --> 01:17:41.340
My dream's stupid.

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:48.208
Time for me to get rid of
all this junk.

01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:52.942
You know, get rid of all my childish
things. Time for me to grow up.

01:17:58.249 --> 01:18:00.217
We've come all this way.

01:18:02.116 --> 01:18:03.743
Why are you giving up on me now?

01:18:06.554 --> 01:18:07.714
I'm sorry.

01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:10.382
I can't.

01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:16.261
You guys better get out of here.

01:18:16.764 --> 01:18:18.425
My dad'll shoot you.

01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:19.792
He will.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.087
Next, please.

01:18:43.725 --> 01:18:46.216
Hell, everybody knows
wrestling's fake.

01:18:52.701 --> 01:18:54.191
That feel fake?

01:19:01.698 --> 01:19:05.065
We are Satan's Siamese twins!

01:19:06.014 --> 01:19:08.504
You guys aren't really
Siamese twins, are you?

01:19:10.885 --> 01:19:11.852
Sorry.

01:19:18.226 --> 01:19:22.629
Oklahoma, where the wind goes
Sweeping down the plains

01:19:22.848 --> 01:19:26.306
Where the waving wheat
Sure smells sweet

01:19:28.136 --> 01:19:30.502
Aren't these the auditions
for Oklahoma?

01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:34.039
Oklahoma, okay

01:19:32.908 --> 01:19:34.432
Okay, Dawkins, who's left?

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.699
First, Fireman Fred.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.701
I'm Fireman Fred,
and I'm gonna hose you!

01:19:42.623 --> 01:19:44.887
Those are good, right?

01:19:45.153 --> 01:19:46.848
Next, this is The Chewer.

01:19:54.162 --> 01:19:56.426
Come on. Last, but not least...

01:19:56.913 --> 01:19:58.346
...this is Kitty.

01:19:59.835 --> 01:20:04.033
Hi, darling, I'm afraid we need to
take people who can help us in Vegas.

01:20:07.475 --> 01:20:10.603
My friends, they call me Pretty Kitty.

01:20:13.282 --> 01:20:15.250
What's she gonna do,
boob them to death?

01:20:17.686 --> 01:20:19.244
How you feeling, big guy?

01:20:20.588 --> 01:20:22.385
- I feel pretty good.
- Good.

01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:24.353
Haven't felt this good in a long time.

01:20:24.592 --> 01:20:26.253
Good. Keep it up.

01:20:26.961 --> 01:20:28.826
You ready for Vegas tomorrow?

01:20:29.063 --> 01:20:30.087
Yeah.

01:20:31.265 --> 01:20:32.755
I wish Gordie was coming.

01:20:32.967 --> 01:20:34.229
Me too.

01:20:42.977 --> 01:20:44.103
Thank you.

01:20:45.346 --> 01:20:46.404
Thank you.

01:20:49.784 --> 01:20:50.751
Thank you very much.

01:20:54.155 --> 01:20:56.487
See you, now. Bye-bye.

01:20:57.626 --> 01:20:59.457
Hey, Sean.

01:20:59.729 --> 01:21:02.061
I saw you on TNT.
What was New York like?

01:21:02.264 --> 01:21:03.925
It was good. It was fun.

01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:07.693
You know, but I'm not much
of a big-city fella.

01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:10.638
My heart's right here in Lusk.

01:21:10.872 --> 01:21:12.271
I'll see you, okay?

01:21:18.013 --> 01:21:19.241
Excuse me.

01:21:20.182 --> 01:21:21.308
Hi, Wendy.

01:21:22.551 --> 01:21:25.679
I couldn't stop thinking about
how you were always nice to me.

01:21:26.121 --> 01:21:30.524
And I was thinking I should've been a
lot nicer back. I got you something.

01:21:32.295 --> 01:21:34.159
Thank you, Sean.

01:21:36.832 --> 01:21:37.799
Like it?

01:21:38.033 --> 01:21:41.093
It's the greatest.

01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:43.705
I have a gift for you too.

01:21:45.141 --> 01:21:46.369
Come here.

01:22:08.598 --> 01:22:11.226
Really wish I could go with you,
but I can't.

01:22:12.168 --> 01:22:13.294
I'm sorry.

01:22:13.770 --> 01:22:15.601
I feel like I let you down.

01:22:15.938 --> 01:22:18.406
I understand. Really, I do.

01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:20.441
And I want to tell you something.

01:22:20.678 --> 01:22:22.578
No matter what happens in Vegas...

01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:25.578
...I can't thank you enough
for what you did for me.

01:22:26.683 --> 01:22:27.877
All right?

01:22:29.554 --> 01:22:31.112
Good luck to you, now.

01:22:35.592 --> 01:22:36.889
You take care of yourself.

01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:07.751
Wait! Stop the car!

01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:12.629
Good luck, King!

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:14.831
- You all right?
- Totally.

01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:17.695
- I just want to say good luck.
- Thank you.

01:23:17.903 --> 01:23:20.167
- I'll see you at the restaurant.
- Definitely.

01:23:24.042 --> 01:23:25.634
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:23:25.844 --> 01:23:28.506
I'll totally be thinking of you. Bye!

01:24:11.524 --> 01:24:13.992
Listen to me very carefully.

01:24:16.195 --> 01:24:19.722
If you plan to have
any future at all...

01:24:19.933 --> 01:24:21.628
...in my business...

01:24:23.136 --> 01:24:25.866
...you will not allow Jimmy King...

01:24:26.573 --> 01:24:28.507
...to reach that belt.

01:24:30.143 --> 01:24:31.132
What?

01:24:31.311 --> 01:24:33.370
Excuse me, Mr. Sinclair?
They're ready.

01:24:33.613 --> 01:24:35.012
Thank you.

01:24:40.221 --> 01:24:42.815
I will kill you if you fuck this up.

01:25:03.545 --> 01:25:04.705
Looking good, baby.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.805
Thank you. You're looking good.

01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:09.778
Am I?

01:25:10.385 --> 01:25:11.817
Are you ready?

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.418
Hell, yeah.

01:25:23.164 --> 01:25:25.257
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:25:25.433 --> 01:25:29.802
- Why did you drag me here?
- Because he sent the tickets.

01:25:30.004 --> 01:25:33.440
And welcome to One-Man Suicide!

01:25:34.141 --> 01:25:37.702
Tonight the WCW belt...

01:25:37.912 --> 01:25:39.675
...is on the line!

01:25:41.183 --> 01:25:45.643
One million dollars is on the line!

01:25:47.089 --> 01:25:49.580
And one man's life...

01:25:50.225 --> 01:25:53.388
...is on the line!

01:25:58.167 --> 01:25:59.464
Jimmy King!

01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:02.135
You want the belt?

01:26:02.772 --> 01:26:05.138
Come on down and get it!

01:26:06.977 --> 01:26:11.277
It's on top of the cage of death.

01:26:12.048 --> 01:26:14.539
Which is on top of another cage.

01:26:14.752 --> 01:26:19.314
Which is yet on top of another cage!

01:26:23.427 --> 01:26:24.724
Three cages...

01:26:25.796 --> 01:26:27.491
...two warriors...

01:26:28.499 --> 01:26:30.057
...one belt.

01:26:30.801 --> 01:26:32.166
Triple cage.

01:26:32.636 --> 01:26:35.161
Come on down.

01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:41.642
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time...

01:26:42.045 --> 01:26:46.448
...for the WCW Royal Bash main event...

01:26:46.984 --> 01:26:51.421
...for the Heavyweight Championship
of the World!

01:26:54.258 --> 01:26:57.227
Coming to the ring first,
from Marietta, Georgia...

01:26:57.394 --> 01:27:00.090
Okay, baby, triple cage.

01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:03.857
You watch my back.
Keep that posse on standby.

01:27:04.602 --> 01:27:07.264
Jimmy King!

01:27:10.241 --> 01:27:11.936
Watch out for the pyro!

01:27:12.710 --> 01:27:13.836
What was that?

01:27:16.547 --> 01:27:18.538
What was that last thing?

01:27:19.751 --> 01:27:21.844
Oh, my God, I'm on fire! I'm melting!

01:27:22.053 --> 01:27:25.113
I'm melting!
Sweet Jesus, I'm melting!

01:27:26.558 --> 01:27:29.356
I said, "Watch out for the pyro."

01:27:29.694 --> 01:27:32.424
And now, making his entrance
to the ring...

01:27:32.732 --> 01:27:34.063
...DDP...

01:27:34.265 --> 01:27:37.199
...Diamond Dallas Page!

01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:56.215
I heard Sal was just too beat up
to make the trip.

01:27:57.656 --> 01:28:01.888
And now the triple cage is
in place and ready.

01:28:02.161 --> 01:28:06.154
The challenger and champion are ready.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.727
Are we ready?

01:28:13.105 --> 01:28:15.130
For the thousands in attendance...

01:28:15.307 --> 01:28:18.470
...and the millions watching
around the world...

01:28:19.612 --> 01:28:21.136
...ladies and gentlemen...

01:28:21.514 --> 01:28:22.708
...we are...

01:28:22.915 --> 01:28:26.373
...ready to rumble!

01:28:37.597 --> 01:28:38.689
See you in hell.

01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:43.064
There's the opening bell. You can feel
the electricity and the emotion...

01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:44.897
...in this great arena.

01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:49.505
Come on, let's do this!

01:28:53.779 --> 01:28:54.609
You can't spit!

01:28:59.853 --> 01:29:00.649
Yeah, that's it!

01:29:08.029 --> 01:29:09.963
Oh, jeez, God, that's bad.

01:29:16.338 --> 01:29:19.136
Come on, King.
Let me give you a hand, buddy.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.629
Page!

01:29:22.376 --> 01:29:25.504
You idiot! That stuff doesn't work.

01:29:28.784 --> 01:29:31.048
A diamond upside down is a pussy!

01:29:31.253 --> 01:29:33.050
- Come on, King!
- Son of a bitch!

01:29:33.254 --> 01:29:35.085
King positioning the ladder
in the ring.

01:29:35.256 --> 01:29:36.348
Hurry up! Come on!

01:29:36.558 --> 01:29:38.822
He's headed up to the second cage.

01:29:39.026 --> 01:29:39.856
Get him now!

01:29:40.062 --> 01:29:43.896
Who are these two guys that are
coming out? That's Juventud Guerrero.

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.869
Juventud Guerrero just
drop-kicked the ladder!

01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:52.174
Who's that other masked wrestler?

01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:56.342
- The crown!
- King's going for the crown!

01:29:56.545 --> 01:29:58.206
Come on, King.

01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:01.007
Smack him around like
a toothless crack whore!

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:07.921
Everybody out here now!
All of you, let's go! Come on!

01:30:08.290 --> 01:30:11.316
Four men are coming out.
Of course, it's DDP's goons.

01:30:13.929 --> 01:30:15.294
Look out, Jimmy!

01:30:22.003 --> 01:30:25.598
Yeah, baby! That's it!
That's what I'm talking about!

01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:28.738
Don't, Dad, don't!

01:30:28.978 --> 01:30:30.275
Don't do it, Dad.

01:30:30.447 --> 01:30:32.210
Why did Jimmy King stop?

01:30:32.749 --> 01:30:35.980
What's going on here?
He just stopped in his tracks.

01:30:37.087 --> 01:30:38.315
Son?

01:30:38.522 --> 01:30:40.888
Jesus, what the hell are you doing?

01:30:41.091 --> 01:30:42.080
Paying you back!

01:30:45.763 --> 01:30:48.994
Now Jimmy King's the recipient
of a horrible beating.

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:51.133
And it all started with his own son.

01:31:02.346 --> 01:31:03.404
Yeah, baby!

01:31:05.449 --> 01:31:06.438
Here comes relief.

01:31:06.984 --> 01:31:09.976
Look, it's Goldberg.
It's the Disco Inferno...

01:31:10.188 --> 01:31:11.746
...Kidman and Booker T.!

01:31:12.757 --> 01:31:15.452
There's no way they can
get through the gate.

01:31:17.627 --> 01:31:20.027
Mike, what is this?
What's this right here?

01:31:42.987 --> 01:31:45.615
- Get him good!
- You want to turn that crap off?

01:31:46.223 --> 01:31:48.691
My son almost threw away a career
for that nonsense.

01:31:48.927 --> 01:31:51.452
Your son's starting a career
with that nonsense.

01:31:51.664 --> 01:31:53.154
Hit him, hit him.

01:31:53.331 --> 01:31:55.060
Come on. You can do it.

01:31:56.168 --> 01:31:57.157
Come on, King!

01:31:57.336 --> 01:31:59.429
Son of a bitch!

01:32:00.906 --> 01:32:02.737
Get up and get that belt!

01:32:03.309 --> 01:32:06.369
That's my best friend.
He's not really a cop, though.

01:32:09.650 --> 01:32:11.379
Harpoon his ass!

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:18.915
That's my boy!

01:32:20.693 --> 01:32:22.354
Nice spear, kid.

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:24.485
Who you calling "kid"?

01:32:24.697 --> 01:32:27.062
You hear me?
Go in there and get them!

01:32:27.265 --> 01:32:30.291
Jimmy King has made his way
up to the second cage.

01:32:30.503 --> 01:32:33.199
You have the right to an attorney!
If you cannot...

01:32:33.706 --> 01:32:37.164
- Good to have you back, brother!
- Good to be back, brother.

01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:40.335
Did you check it out?
Do you like my deal?

01:32:40.546 --> 01:32:42.036
You're such the Ponch!

01:32:42.248 --> 01:32:44.808
Gordie, you look great
in that uniform.

01:32:45.051 --> 01:32:47.212
And the fans love you.

01:32:47.387 --> 01:32:49.412
I think we should get back together.

01:32:50.791 --> 01:32:53.760
I could never forgive you
for what you did to Sal.

01:32:53.993 --> 01:32:55.255
You're a mean lady.

01:32:56.896 --> 01:32:57.885
Shut up, Sean!

01:32:58.131 --> 01:32:59.155
You shouldn't...

01:33:00.833 --> 01:33:04.269
- stand so close to the ring
when there's a ladder match going on.

01:33:07.506 --> 01:33:10.202
Now both Diamond Dallas Page
and Jimmy King...

01:33:10.845 --> 01:33:13.541
...have made it up to the second cage.

01:33:20.754 --> 01:33:23.882
The further you get up,
the tougher it is...

01:33:24.125 --> 01:33:25.990
...and they are wasting each other.

01:33:27.729 --> 01:33:29.754
Can you imagine the intensity?

01:33:32.067 --> 01:33:34.900
This thing has turned into
a hard-core street fight.

01:33:40.708 --> 01:33:44.166
DDP is headed up. He's made his way
into cage number three.

01:34:08.036 --> 01:34:12.029
He just sent Jimmy King down
all the way to cage number one!

01:34:20.949 --> 01:34:23.850
It's Sting! He nailed
Diamond Dallas Page!

01:34:27.122 --> 01:34:28.521
What are you doing, freak?!

01:34:29.825 --> 01:34:32.623
Sting is helping Jimmy King!
Can you believe this?

01:34:32.996 --> 01:34:34.293
This is a shocker!

01:34:37.499 --> 01:34:38.932
Jimmy King's all right by me.

01:34:39.936 --> 01:34:41.494
You love Jimmy King.

01:34:42.238 --> 01:34:43.865
I love Jimmy King.

01:34:44.107 --> 01:34:45.199
We're men.

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:48.503
And we're not afraid to say
that we love other men.

01:34:49.279 --> 01:34:50.268
I love you.

01:34:52.582 --> 01:34:54.743
Me too, man. Hit me! My turn!

01:34:55.718 --> 01:34:57.549
It's even. It's back to square one.

01:34:58.454 --> 01:35:02.481
They're fighting their way up
the side of the cage toward the top.

01:35:26.684 --> 01:35:29.118
Who the hell are you fighting for?

01:35:29.286 --> 01:35:30.981
Me!

01:35:53.577 --> 01:35:56.944
You got it, King! You got it!
Come on!

01:36:22.474 --> 01:36:25.409
Diamond Dallas Page has taken
a horrible fall!

01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:26.872
He's down!

01:36:31.816 --> 01:36:33.716
Yeah! Come on, buddy!

01:36:46.633 --> 01:36:49.295
And Jimmy King has the belt!
He did it!

01:36:49.502 --> 01:36:51.766
Jimmy King is the champion!

01:36:53.005 --> 01:36:54.734
Yeah, baby!

01:36:54.941 --> 01:36:56.602
You did it!

01:37:11.959 --> 01:37:14.223
Yeah! That's right!

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:21.165
What a struggle, what a battle!

01:37:21.367 --> 01:37:24.825
Jimmy King has overcome all the odds,
Mike! He's the champion!

01:37:25.037 --> 01:37:27.562
You suck, Sinclair!

01:37:28.941 --> 01:37:29.999
Get out of here!

01:37:34.413 --> 01:37:35.846
What are you talking about?

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:39.512
I made wrestling! Me!

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.715
I made them all!

01:37:44.057 --> 01:37:46.719
You didn't make wrestling!
We made wrestling!

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:50.619
Yeah, geek.

01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:53.323
The people, the fans made wrestling.

01:38:06.715 --> 01:38:09.878
We want King! We want King!

01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:14.787
In the most amazing battle ever
witnessed, ladies and gentlemen...

01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:19.017
...the undisputed WCW
Heavyweight Champion of the World:

01:38:19.228 --> 01:38:21.753
Jimmy King!

01:38:24.432 --> 01:38:26.297
You regained the heavyweight title.

01:38:26.502 --> 01:38:29.368
What about tag-team belts?
Any thoughts about unification?

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:33.131
Excuse me. Jimmy, looks like
you need a tag-team partner.

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.637
What do you say?

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:38.074
Bill, I appreciate it. Really, I do.

01:38:39.715 --> 01:38:43.776
But I think I already got me
a tag-team partner out here somewhere.

01:38:44.386 --> 01:38:45.512
Where is he?

01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:50.483
There he is. That's him right there.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.660
My new tag-team partner.

01:38:53.862 --> 01:38:55.921
That's Gordie Boggs, a.k.a. The Law!

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:01.091
I will bust you!

01:39:01.804 --> 01:39:03.795
That's it! That's it!

01:39:04.006 --> 01:39:05.997
Right here's our new manager...

01:39:06.208 --> 01:39:09.006
...Sean "Sugar Daddy" Dawkins!

01:39:13.983 --> 01:39:16.008
I love you, Sean!

01:39:16.219 --> 01:39:18.187
I love Sean!

01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:44.742
So you see...

01:39:45.116 --> 01:39:46.447
...dreams can come true.

01:39:46.649 --> 01:39:49.140
Yeah, but it was a one-time deal.

01:39:49.319 --> 01:39:52.447
Like you'll really manage King,
and Gordie's gonna wrestle.

01:40:09.975 --> 01:40:11.840
Can you say it now?

01:40:13.845 --> 01:40:16.507
I'm your bitch and you're my daddy?

01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:20.310
Rolled right off his tongue.

01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:22.985
That should teach you
to be nice to kids.

01:40:28.426 --> 01:40:29.324
Gentlemen...

01:40:30.128 --> 01:40:31.322
...we've gotta go.

01:40:41.674 --> 01:40:44.199
God bless America!

01:41:00.493 --> 01:41:02.791
You like Samoan butt sex?

01:41:04.596 --> 01:41:08.191
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, anus-breath!

01:41:08.366 --> 01:41:12.063
There's a lot of glare coming off
of that dome of yours, booger-face!

01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:15.728
I know. It smells like you poured it
right from your butt.

01:41:15.941 --> 01:41:18.933
Smells like you poured it
right from your butt. Sorry.

01:41:22.082 --> 01:41:23.777
Wait, I forgot the line.

01:41:23.984 --> 01:41:26.179
Now I'm gonna get you!

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:28.887
Oh, shit, man!

01:41:29.089 --> 01:41:32.183
Michael got himself a whore

01:41:32.359 --> 01:41:33.826
Sorry.

01:41:34.294 --> 01:41:36.285
That was quite a thrill.
How you...?

01:41:36.496 --> 01:41:38.259
That's my hand. It's broken now.

01:41:38.432 --> 01:41:39.865
Come on, this is nothing!

01:41:40.067 --> 01:41:43.002
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

01:41:43.303 --> 01:41:44.292
Go. Start again.

01:41:44.503 --> 01:41:45.800
Come on, this is nothing!

01:41:46.005 --> 01:41:48.701
You remember when Macho Man
threw you off the rail?

01:41:48.909 --> 01:41:50.774
No, that's bad. One more time.

01:41:50.978 --> 01:41:52.843
Come on, this is nothing!

01:41:53.046 --> 01:41:54.240
- Sorry.
- Shut up.

01:41:54.414 --> 01:41:58.145
Yeah, and he broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder...

01:41:58.318 --> 01:42:00.377
...but you broke...

01:42:00.754 --> 01:42:03.120
You broke five ribs
and dislocated your shoulder!

01:42:03.291 --> 01:42:05.623
You still came back to whip all three!

01:42:07.593 --> 01:42:09.788
He's worthless.

01:42:09.998 --> 01:42:11.590
He can't do it.

01:42:13.635 --> 01:42:15.660
Breasts. Jugs. Hooters.

01:42:16.938 --> 01:42:19.463
I can't stop looking at them!

01:42:26.281 --> 01:42:27.805
Terrifying.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.832
Oh, the humanity!
