WEBVTT

00:03.556 --> 00:05.678
Man, I can't believe
thanksgiving's tomorrow.

00:05.725 --> 00:08.888
It's such a special time of
the year, when like to give thanks,

00:08.926 --> 00:11.577
get fez drunk and dress
him up like a lady pilgrim.

00:12.719 --> 00:13.448
Well,

00:13.571 --> 00:15.626
the joke's on you
because this year

00:15.655 --> 00:18.628
I'm getting into the
dress before I get drunk.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.263
Ah, touché.

00:23.589 --> 00:26.063
Well, so long
as it happens.

00:26.170 --> 00:28.710
I had thanksgiving dinner last
night with brooke and the baby

00:28.741 --> 00:31.917
so I could be here tonight
for fez and the dress.

00:31.950 --> 00:34.890
Hey guys. I got something really
different planned for thanksgiving.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.640
But instead of
telling you about it,

00:36.980 --> 00:38.290
I'm gonna let it
wash over you.

00:38.334 --> 00:41.316
But, eric, maybe you could let some
soap and water wash over you,

00:41.363 --> 00:43.589
'cause since you've been out
of work, you're a little bummy

00:45.132 --> 00:47.622
welcome to the
grand illusion

00:47.680 --> 00:50.487
come on in and see
what's happenin'

00:50.534 --> 00:54.332
pay the price get the
ticket for the show...

00:59.627 --> 01:00.813
Is that Styx?

01:00.848 --> 01:03.191
And they just announced
a concert thanksgiving night.

01:03.238 --> 01:05.114
Now if we camp
out for tickets,

01:05.177 --> 01:08.923
by tomorrow, we could be watching
five guys in spandex suits

01:08.958 --> 01:11.224
shaking their hair
sweat on teenage girls.

01:11.248 --> 01:12.293
Forman.

01:12.727 --> 01:14.556
even if I liked Styx,

01:14.592 --> 01:17.163
which would mean I
was born without ears,

01:18.020 --> 01:22.329
I still can't go. My dad wants me and Angie
to open the record store by midnight tomorrow.

01:22.905 --> 01:24.827
Oh, man, Angie
is so pretty.

01:24.851 --> 01:27.727
You know, looking at Angie
is like looking at...

01:30.569 --> 01:32.682
Something else pretty.

01:33.645 --> 01:34.899
Well said.

01:35.615 --> 01:37.470
Donna, you in for Styx?

01:37.506 --> 01:40.652
Eric, I'm a DJ. I can't be
seen at a Styx concert.

01:41.193 --> 01:42.719
It's in my contract.

01:43.377 --> 01:47.568
Well, Fez, what do you say,
my man from another land?

01:48.319 --> 01:51.008
Eric, where I come
from, we have a saying.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.004
Ecch. Styx.

01:58.109 --> 02:01.021
Remember, kids,
music is joy, comfort,

02:01.056 --> 02:03.064
A Band Aid for a
wounded soul.

02:03.099 --> 02:06.138
And if you get people to believe that crap,
you're gonna sell a lot of records.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.133
Here are the
keys to the store.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.202
Thank you.

02:09.508 --> 02:12.899
I just figure whoever hasn't been
in prison should hold the keys.

02:13.474 --> 02:14.766
I thought
she'd do that,

02:14.801 --> 02:16.645
So I made an
extra set for you.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.465
Everybody gets keys.

02:18.943 --> 02:20.258
Thank you.

02:21.456 --> 02:23.112
You don't know
me very well,

02:23.147 --> 02:25.470
but you're gonna have to
make three of everything.

02:25.740 --> 02:28.370
I'm starting to get you
a little bit. You're funny.

02:29.837 --> 02:32.338
All right, well as co-manager
of this record store,

02:32.371 --> 02:34.978
My first order is...

02:35.670 --> 02:36.739
A pizza.

02:38.312 --> 02:41.298
Are you crazy? We have
to start unloading records.

02:41.354 --> 02:44.736
Hey, look, I don't know
about these other jokers,

02:44.771 --> 02:48.276
But I am
here to help,

02:48.534 --> 02:53.601
So, if you need to get anything off of one of these
high shelves, I'll be happy to watch you reach for it.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.426
All right guys, we got a ton of
box to unpack, posters to hang,

02:58.473 --> 03:00.211
so let's
hit it.

03:00.584 --> 03:02.416
I love
hittin' it.

03:02.498 --> 03:05.363
I love that you taught
me to love hittin' it.

03:05.927 --> 03:08.580
You know, this is the first
time we've ever hit it at

03:09.376 --> 03:11.865
Hey, this place doesn't
have a name yet.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.916
you should call it
"hot wax records,"

03:15.951 --> 03:17.290
but with a z-

03:17.313 --> 03:18.910
Recordzzz.

03:19.497 --> 03:21.669
Z's are so
Rock'n'roll.

03:22.481 --> 03:24.735
"funk man's
house of funk."

03:25.780 --> 03:28.551
"funk man's funky
house of funk."

03:29.326 --> 03:31.674
"Funky man's funky
house of hittin' it."

03:32.637 --> 03:34.669
You guys writing
this done or what?

03:35.374 --> 03:37.288
Steven it's
too complicated.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.329
You need something that
sounds hot and upscale.

03:40.669 --> 03:42.924
You should
call it "Jackie".

03:44.116 --> 03:46.100
If you want it
hot and upscale,

03:46.135 --> 03:48.953
you should call
it : "Dijon mustard"

03:49.728 --> 03:52.429
What about, huh,
like "headfood"?

03:52.769 --> 03:55.124
"Headsies."
"The head!"

03:56.110 --> 03:57.613
This is kinda cool.

03:57.754 --> 03:58.940
"The Head."

03:59.621 --> 04:01.288
- "The Head."
- "The Head."

04:02.404 --> 04:03.816
"The Head."

04:07.268 --> 04:09.252
I smell something burning.

04:10.332 --> 04:11.788
That'd be us.

04:13.327 --> 04:14.706
Man.

04:14.823 --> 04:18.123
We just came up with the
best name for the record store.

04:18.252 --> 04:19.519
It's, um..

04:23.712 --> 04:25.735
"The funky mustard house."

04:27.168 --> 04:29.351
I thought we settled
down "Jackie"!

04:30.314 --> 04:33.015
I just had it, and then it
popped out of my head.

04:33.367 --> 04:35.490
That's it!
"Poppers"

04:37.416 --> 04:40.703
This is a chain. All the
stores are called "Grooves."

04:42.441 --> 04:45.018
Oh, that's why
we have that sign.

04:46.849 --> 04:50.783
All right well, let's call it a day
and hit it hard again tomorrow.

04:51.663 --> 04:53.155
Good work
everyone.

04:55.774 --> 04:58.498
Wait. I just
remembered the name.

04:58.568 --> 05:00.013
"Lumpy's."

05:02.009 --> 05:04.204
No, it wasn't
called "Lumpy's."

05:04.931 --> 05:07.514
Well, my store is gonna
be called "Lumpy's."

05:10.533 --> 05:13.866
That  70's Show - Saison 7 Episode 09
"You can't always get what you want."

First one here.

05:56.085 --> 05:59.627
Hey, you guys getting in line
for Styx tickets, too?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.110
Yeah, right.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.227
If we weren't late for this
party, we'd kick your ass.

06:05.210 --> 06:07.064
Styx rules.

06:07.171 --> 06:08.264
What was
that, dork?

06:08.304 --> 06:10.344
I  said enjoy
your party.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.073
Oh, my god. 

06:18.967 --> 06:21.273
Did I miss it? Are
there any tickets left?

06:22.487 --> 06:25.521
Black sabbath's been
sold out for weeks.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.494
No, Styx.

06:27.881 --> 06:30.268
I prefer a more lush,
orchestral sound.

06:31.601 --> 06:34.746
Yeah, well,
you're the only one.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.106
Just give me
the damn ticket.

06:39.359 --> 06:43.519
Man, hyde, this listening pit
is an awesome idea.

06:43.692 --> 06:46.438
Yeah, you made a place
for people to hang out,

06:46.465 --> 06:49.505
listen to music and feel
up angie and stuff.

06:50.838 --> 06:52.798
That's not what
this pit is for, man.

06:52.838 --> 06:56.145
It's for listening to records
and feeling up jackie and stuff.

06:58.331 --> 06:59.798
Steven's so
innovative.

06:59.824 --> 07:02.291
You know, he designed
this whole thing from scratch.

07:02.358 --> 07:03.451
Um,

07:04.611 --> 07:07.283
this is exactly
eric's basement.

07:08.403 --> 07:12.350
You're just jealous because steven's
successful and eric's all bummy.

07:17.314 --> 07:18.527
What is all this?

07:18.567 --> 07:20.234
What happened to
the soft rock section?

07:20.274 --> 07:21.474
I put it in
the alley.

07:22.994 --> 07:25.771
See, that way, if somebody comes
in asking for barry manilow,

07:25.824 --> 07:28.784
I can send 'em outside
and lock the door.

07:29.358 --> 07:32.905
Steven, the store
is very important to me.

07:33.211 --> 07:36.270
When I was 8 years old, Santa asked
me what I wanted for christmas,

07:36.298 --> 07:37.846
and I said a record store.

07:38.165 --> 07:39.377
You know
what I got?

07:39.405 --> 07:40.410
A pony.

07:41.246 --> 07:43.602
What 8-year-old girl
wants a damn pony?

07:43.785 --> 07:47.343
You know, one year I asked for
a damn pony and got a car.

07:48.282 --> 07:50.419
I just want the
store to be great.

07:50.501 --> 07:53.602
Yeah, well, I think this pit
makes the store great.

07:53.649 --> 07:55.727
Really? Did you go
to business school?

07:55.762 --> 07:58.181
Well, he did a lot of
business at school.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.090
Fine,

08:00.140 --> 08:03.460
I'll get rid of the pit, but I want
that entire wall covered in zeppelin.

08:03.490 --> 08:04.700
We can't.

08:04.743 --> 08:07.913
You know that research paper that I
gave you that you probably smoked?

08:08.535 --> 08:11.019
Well, it says that zeppelin
scares people over 30.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.049
Good, because people over
30 don't listen to music.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.820
They move to Florida
to play golf.

08:19.661 --> 08:23.418
Man, Angie is so
awesome and classy.

08:24.017 --> 08:27.093
She's like the first page
of a "playboy" layout.

08:28.267 --> 08:30.627
You know, before
you see her cans.

08:32.594 --> 08:35.400
Do you know that all that stuff
about those girls is made up?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.972
Yeah, they're not
really librarians or

08:38.135 --> 08:40.025
horse trainers
or

08:41.212 --> 08:42.469
scientists.

08:44.735 --> 08:46.390
They're just whores.

08:52.343 --> 08:55.428
I wish someone would
rub my shoulders like this.

08:56.849 --> 08:58.046
Hey,

08:58.328 --> 09:00.500
whatcha cookin',
good-lookin'?

09:01.193 --> 09:04.802
Guess who got a ticket
to see styx in concert tonight.

09:05.494 --> 09:08.019
Tonight? Honey,
it's thanksgiving.

09:08.054 --> 09:10.661
Yeah, but this is a
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

09:11.471 --> 09:14.160
Mom, this ticket was
really hard to get.

09:14.817 --> 09:16.256
Was it harder to get

09:16.292 --> 09:21.540
than the holiday traditions this family has built
through decades of love and sacrifice?

09:21.575 --> 09:24.006
Much harder. Thanks
for understanding.

09:30.262 --> 09:33.596
There's my beautiful bride.
I'll be in the garage.

09:33.643 --> 09:34.627
Red.

09:37.198 --> 09:39.406
None of the kids are
coming for dinner tonight.

09:39.453 --> 09:43.868
Laurie's in canada, steven has his store,
and now eric is going to a concert.

09:43.997 --> 09:47.529
There's no point in me
even making my special yams.

09:48.645 --> 09:49.526
What?

09:51.968 --> 09:54.574
Kitty, I love
those yams.

09:54.923 --> 09:57.647
They're among the top three
reasons I married you.

09:58.434 --> 10:01.252
Well, I can't make
them if I'm sad.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.013
Look, I'll tell
you what.

10:03.189 --> 10:05.197
You get started
on the yams,

10:05.241 --> 10:06.991
and I'll go
talk to eric.

10:07.495 --> 10:08.470
Thanks.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.041
Gosh,

10:11.077 --> 10:14.024
my shoulders are sore
from all this cooking.

10:14.118 --> 10:16.173
Think you could
rub 'em a little?

10:17.128 --> 10:19.887
Kitty, it's thanksgiving,
not christmas.

10:34.252 --> 10:36.025
Styx, Kelso?

10:39.803 --> 10:43.877
All right, fine! I like styx, okay?
And I don't care if anybody knows it!

10:44.523 --> 10:46.883
Well, that's not true.
Don't tell anyone.

10:50.194 --> 10:52.213
Why aren't you putting
the records in the bins?

10:53.012 --> 10:54.115
What bins?

10:54.409 --> 10:55.818
The ones I ordered.

10:59.317 --> 11:01.834
Oh, my god. I never
ordered the bins.

11:02.074 --> 11:02.856
Hmm.

11:02.997 --> 11:04.922
That would never
happen at "Jackie."

11:07.893 --> 11:09.220
What are
we gonna do?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.195
There's no bins.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.248
no bins!

11:15.739 --> 11:17.759
Hey, look, man, I'll take
care of it, all right?

11:17.817 --> 11:19.156
But it's gonna
cost you.

11:19.191 --> 11:20.739
Listening  pit
comes back,

11:20.774 --> 11:22.476
Zeppelin goes up
on that wall,

11:22.559 --> 11:25.764
and I want you to remove the smoke
detectors from the back office.

11:27.173 --> 11:28.418
Whatever you want.

11:28.450 --> 11:29.918
Oh, and also,

11:30.270 --> 11:33.253
my creepy friend gets to
hold your hand for two minutes.

11:36.787 --> 11:38.321
That-- that would be me.

11:39.249 --> 11:40.799
All right, back off.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.805
I want to be the first one of
us who gets to touch her.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.518
You, too,
with the Styx?

11:50.821 --> 11:54.262
Donna, it's just a-- it's just
a present for my friend, um...

11:54.508 --> 11:55.166
um... F...

11:55.483 --> 11:56.716
Fez.
Damn it.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.988
Outta my way, dad.
Time for me to rock.

12:05.798 --> 12:07.301
You're not goin'
to the concert.

12:08.123 --> 12:10.023
- What? Why not?
- Look,

12:10.716 --> 12:13.581
every family has its
holiday traditions.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.575
Some sing, others
play charades--

12:16.610 --> 12:19.182
in our family,
someone always cries.

12:20.650 --> 12:25.018
But I'll be damned if it's gonna
be your mother crying tonight.

12:25.265 --> 12:27.460
I can't see
her like that.

12:28.435 --> 12:29.670
I-I love her.

12:31.407 --> 12:32.734
She threatened not
to make the yams,

12:32.781 --> 12:34.730
Just get the hell
back in the house.

12:41.109 --> 12:42.999
okay, here's
the situation.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.749
It's thanksgiving night.

12:44.984 --> 12:46.604
Everything's closed.

12:46.757 --> 12:49.199
We need to find a hundred
record bins by midnight.

12:50.665 --> 12:53.354
It's the same damn
thing every year.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.761
I have a question.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.696
How does hair
know to grow?

12:59.401 --> 13:02.082
And how far inside
your head does it go?

13:03.139 --> 13:04.712
Does it touch
your brain?

13:07.342 --> 13:11.006
Okay. I think we need to get
Jerry Garcia here some coffee.

13:12.121 --> 13:15.045
Let the girl rap.
I was into it.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.851
I like to think
about my head.

13:18.755 --> 13:20.811
The head. That's
the name.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.431
I saved the day.

13:23.476 --> 13:25.519
Know what would be
perfect for the records?

13:25.566 --> 13:28.314
Those boxes that
milk bottles come in.

13:28.419 --> 13:30.451
They're, like,
crates or

13:31.077 --> 13:33.367
crepes.
Crepes!

13:33.696 --> 13:35.551
How good
are crepes?

13:36.619 --> 13:38.803
That'll work, man.
We need, like,

13:38.838 --> 13:40.846
50 empty
milk crates.

13:41.703 --> 13:43.969
Well, how are we
gonna drink all that milk?

13:44.237 --> 13:45.484
Ooh! Wait.

13:45.507 --> 13:48.243
We need 50
boxes of cookies.

13:50.368 --> 13:53.434
No, wastoid. 
W-we'll steal the crates.

13:53.810 --> 13:54.984
It's perfect.

13:55.442 --> 13:56.921
Milk crates.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.129
Milk crates.

13:59.352 --> 14:00.972
Milk crates.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.367
Milky craties.

14:05.667 --> 14:08.332
Okay, my valium's
starting to wear off.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.258
What's happening
with those boxes?

14:10.704 --> 14:13.169
Man, we just thought
of the perfect solution.

14:13.275 --> 14:15.142
We're gonna go
get some of those...

14:18.112 --> 14:20.226
- The head.
- Crepes.
- Poppers.

14:22.328 --> 14:23.909
Whatever.
We'll be back.

14:26.011 --> 14:28.993
Why is it every time I leave
the room, you guys do this?

14:29.580 --> 14:31.107
It's thanksgiving.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.207
Some people bake pies.

14:34.265 --> 14:36.085
We bake ourselves.

14:43.929 --> 14:47.262
Thank you for opening up your
home to me on this special day.

14:47.297 --> 14:49.622
This family
is all about love.

14:49.657 --> 14:53.191
Yep. Spirit-crushing,
tyrannical love.

14:53.520 --> 14:57.169
Drop that tone of voice, or you'll be
wearing that turkey like a football helmet.

14:57.745 --> 14:58.942
Okay, now,

14:58.989 --> 15:01.936
everybody, take a feather
from the paper turkey

15:01.972 --> 15:04.165
and write down something
you're thankful for.

15:04.212 --> 15:07.136
And then we'll all pick feathers
and guess who wrote them.

15:07.171 --> 15:08.486
Any questions?

15:09.520 --> 15:12.993
This is kind of off topic,
but where can I put my belt?

15:16.821 --> 15:19.252
I'll go first.

15:20.309 --> 15:25.886
"I'm thankful for my mother/wife.
"My life is meaningless without her."

15:26.450 --> 15:28.352
Whoopsy.
I got mine.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.783
It would've sounded better
if someone else had read it.

15:33.328 --> 15:35.583
"I'm thankful
you have pecan pie.

15:35.618 --> 15:37.321
"You do have
pecan pie, right?

15:37.356 --> 15:41.057
"Because I turned down an invitation
"that involved pecan pie."

15:41.882 --> 15:43.086
Hmm.

15:43.264 --> 15:44.426
Bob?

15:45.436 --> 15:48.689
"I'm thankful I didn't waste
my day at a really fun concert."

15:48.724 --> 15:51.657
"This way I can work on
becoming a bitter old man"

15:51.704 --> 15:55.473
"whose only happiness
is destroying his son's life."

15:55.790 --> 15:57.925
Kitty, hand me
the turkey.

15:59.193 --> 16:00.778
I think I
got red's.

16:00.813 --> 16:03.772
Cause the only words
I can repeat are, "eric, little"

16:04.253 --> 16:06.364
and a word that
starts with "mother."

16:07.585 --> 16:09.922
Mother?
That's nice.

16:11.143 --> 16:13.362
It takes a pretty
hard left turn.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.028
Thanksgiving
is ruined!

16:17.509 --> 16:20.491
Don't look at me. Dad's the
one who cursed on turkey.

16:20.538 --> 16:22.179
Kitty! Bob,

16:22.626 --> 16:24.927
touch my yams and die.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.829
Look at all this
stuff I gotta eat.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.365
Okay, look, I'll distract him.
Jackie, give me your lipstick.

16:39.670 --> 16:42.981
Okay, but you picked a really weird
time to get into makeup, donna.

16:43.474 --> 16:46.292
I love it when you whore yourself
for the good of the group.

16:50.098 --> 16:51.671
Hey,  you.

16:52.305 --> 16:53.597
That's, um,

16:53.749 --> 16:56.391
that's a sexy milk
truck you got there.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.671
Really?

16:58.012 --> 16:58.855
Nah.

16:58.926 --> 17:03.023
Oh, yeah. That big cow on
the side is really, um...

17:03.305 --> 17:04.538
Sexy.

17:06.534 --> 17:08.967
I haven't talked to
a woman in four months.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.772
Oh, come
here, big guy.

17:12.278 --> 17:14.732
She's hugging him. Okay, come on.
Let's grab everything. Hurry up.

17:14.755 --> 17:16.564
Or slow down.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.034
I'd like to see
where this goes.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.813
How could you think it would be
okay to miss thanksgiving?

17:23.859 --> 17:26.724
You might as well just
rip my heart out and

17:26.771 --> 17:30.219
drown it in my
delicious giblet gravy.

17:31.228 --> 17:33.342
It's not just thanksgiving.

17:33.671 --> 17:36.230
You used to have
goals and ambition.

17:36.265 --> 17:37.439
But now,

17:37.580 --> 17:40.445
one week you're
chasing butterflies,

17:41.681 --> 17:45.485
the next week, you're skating around
the neighborhood dressed like liberace.

17:47.646 --> 17:51.028
Did it ever occur to you guys
that I don't know what I'm doing?

17:51.572 --> 17:53.098
Okay?
I'm scared.

17:53.157 --> 17:57.090
Of what, honey? We got rid
of the spooky lamp in your room.

18:01.996 --> 18:03.745
Look, my
whole life,

18:04.485 --> 18:07.162
I've been trying
to please other people.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.001
So I feel like I don't
know who I am

18:11.037 --> 18:13.856
or know what I want
to do with my life.

18:13.903 --> 18:16.616
You need a government
job, like a mailman,

18:17.578 --> 18:20.843
something simple
and repetitive.

18:21.042 --> 18:24.534
No, no, no. You know he doesn't
do well in snow. What about this?

18:25.509 --> 18:30.570
Margie's sonis a chiropractor,
and she seems very happy.

18:30.828 --> 18:31.838
I just...

18:32.354 --> 18:35.134
I don't want to wake
up in five years

18:35.569 --> 18:37.107
and hate my life.

18:37.154 --> 18:39.080
That's unavoidable.

18:40.712 --> 18:41.628
Okay.

18:41.795 --> 18:43.627
I just need
more time to think.

18:43.662 --> 18:45.752
You know what I got
for my 18th birthday?

18:45.775 --> 18:48.687
A draft notice and
a malaria vaccine.

18:49.873 --> 18:51.353
I never had
time to think.

18:51.388 --> 18:54.217
Yeah, but, dad, don't you think
it would've been helpful if you did?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.069
All right, I'll
tell you what.

18:58.691 --> 19:00.534
I'll give you
six months.

19:00.828 --> 19:03.567
But if you haven't picked
something by then, you'll do that...

19:03.919 --> 19:06.491
chiropractic thing that
your mother suggested.

19:07.042 --> 19:09.085
Dad, I-I don't even
know what that is.

19:09.121 --> 19:11.763
Oh, honey, it's
perfect for you.

19:11.796 --> 19:15.471
It's like a doctor, but you
don't have to be as smart.

19:22.808 --> 19:25.790
I can't believe I had
to kiss that milkman.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.453
Donna, you've
done worse for less.

19:30.398 --> 19:31.290
Shut up.

19:33.263 --> 19:34.406
Was it milky?

19:34.437 --> 19:35.501
Shut up.

19:39.028 --> 19:41.024
So what do
you think?

19:41.296 --> 19:45.018
I think I see a lot of
records in milk crates.

19:45.441 --> 19:47.625
Where are the bins like
the other stores have?

19:48.447 --> 19:50.676
- Dad, I forgot to tell you...
- Forgot to tell me what?

19:50.711 --> 19:53.588
Uh, what she forgot to tell you
was that it was my idea.

19:53.869 --> 19:56.429
See, I thought it would look cool.
You know, like we, um,

19:56.840 --> 19:58.272
stole 'em or
something.

20:00.063 --> 20:02.764
Well, I don't much like it,
but we'll give it a shot.

20:03.950 --> 20:06.310
Why is Jackie behind
the cash register?

20:08.564 --> 20:11.473
Hey, funny girl, get your
hands off my money!

20:14.045 --> 20:15.536
That was really
nice of you.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.896
I know, and now
you owe me.

20:19.951 --> 20:22.169
I want black lights,
bigger speakers

20:22.193 --> 20:25.410
and a little thing called
the 5-day weekend.

20:28.674 --> 20:29.731
Hey.

20:29.766 --> 20:31.398
Was Hyde being
mean to you?

20:32.033 --> 20:36.718
You know, I can't, uh, beat him up
for you, but, uh, I can get Donna to.

20:38.656 --> 20:40.758
No, he was great.

20:41.016 --> 20:45.077
It's just, I've been waiting for this day
my whole life, and now I don't know.

20:45.594 --> 20:47.226
I don't know what
to do with myself.

20:47.273 --> 20:48.118
Well,

20:48.154 --> 20:51.310
I think that you need to take some
time for you. And may I suggest

20:51.345 --> 20:53.717
an evening out
with Michael Kelso?

20:54.539 --> 20:56.887
Dinner, drinks and a ride
home not included.

20:59.906 --> 21:01.902
I never did have
a thanksgiving dinner.

21:02.149 --> 21:04.227
I can buy
you a taco.

21:05.507 --> 21:10.910
Oh, and then we can celebrate like the original
thanksgiving with the pilgrims and the mexicans.

21:21.727 --> 21:24.580
Welcome to
the grand illusion

21:24.615 --> 21:27.292
come on in and see
what's happening...

21:27.327 --> 21:30.847
hey, check it out.
Jackie's rockin' out to styx.

21:31.563 --> 21:32.491
So?

21:32.667 --> 21:34.323
Fez was mouthing
the words.

21:34.370 --> 21:35.121
I...

21:35.168 --> 21:38.547
I thought it was okay now because
hyde was tapping his foot.

21:38.747 --> 21:41.483
No, no, I was just
squashing a bug.

21:41.894 --> 21:44.383
Donna, you've been kinda
quiet. Are you okay?

21:45.187 --> 21:47.254
I kissed the milkman!

21:48.628 --> 21:50.589
Happy thanksgiving, forman.
