WEBVTT

02:00.720 --> 02:02.721
Please don't leave a message.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.910
Hey, where are you going?
I was just coming to see you.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.513
Oh, I'm sorry,
I gotta go see Cole.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.181
Wait, why,
what's up with your brother?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.849
Nothing, I just gotta
go see him.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.818
You gonna ask me?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.354
Ask you what?

02:35.356 --> 02:37.789
How I did in the poker game.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.659
Well, you're not wearing
your shirt, so, I'm guessing
you didn't do too well.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.628
Yeah, only 'cause the guy
who won it from me left early,

02:42.630 --> 02:44.263
so, I didn't get a chance
to win it back.

02:44.265 --> 02:48.167
But about an hour ago,
I turned it around. I won...

02:48.169 --> 02:49.401
over $200.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.737
So, you've got my money.

02:53.206 --> 02:54.740
I kind of had to pay
some back rent.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.510
I gotta go.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.129
Hi.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.197
Hey, Ellie.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.868
What are you doing?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.971
Sarah wants to start
parking her car in here, so...

03:27.473 --> 03:29.408
All this stuff's
gotta go to Goodwill.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.883
You send your resume
in to that design firm
you were talking about?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.752
They're never
gonna hire somebody
without a degree, so...

03:40.754 --> 03:42.788
How do you know
without even trying?

03:47.694 --> 03:50.762
I, um, got a call

03:50.764 --> 03:52.631
from somebody in Texas.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.668
Was it Dad?

03:56.670 --> 03:58.036
I don't know, I haven't
listened to the message,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.605
I'm too scared to listen to it.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.275
You want me to listen to it?

04:06.412 --> 04:09.281
Wha... What do you think
that he wants?

04:09.283 --> 04:13.285
Booze. Or money to buy booze.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.354
Or money to get out of jail
so he can go buy booze.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.257
-Yeah, but do you think
that maybe he...
-Erase it, Ellie.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.559
As far as I'm concerned,
we have a mom and dad

04:20.560 --> 04:23.729
and they're both very much dead.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.931
Except no one's gotten around
to burying Dad yet.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.770
I think that we should hear
what he has to say.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.641
Let me show you something.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.614
I found this, uh, this morning.

04:49.822 --> 04:53.558
That trip was about
the last time I can remember
being a whole family.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.063
Who's to blame for that
except Dad?

05:14.847 --> 05:16.815
<i>This is a message for Ellie.</i>

05:16.817 --> 05:20.952
<i>This is, uh,
your stepmother, Amanda.</i>

05:20.954 --> 05:24.289
<i>I think you may wanna head on
down here to Texas.</i>

05:24.291 --> 05:28.327
<i>Your daddy had a stroke,</i>
<i>and I don't know if he's gonna</i>
<i>be around much longer.</i>

05:28.329 --> 05:30.696
<i>Anyway, I just thought
I should let you know.</i>

05:35.201 --> 05:36.401
He wants money, right?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.339
Is there anything?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.207
I'm sorry, but this flight
is overbooked.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.608
Yeah, well, I know.
What does that mean?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.844
It means that not everyone
on this flight...

05:45.846 --> 05:48.280
No, I know
what the words mean, but I...

05:48.282 --> 05:50.349
I really have
to get on this flight.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.517
My father is not well.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.454
Uh, it's... There just...

05:55.456 --> 05:57.356
We do have another flight
that leaves at 3:30...

05:57.358 --> 06:00.058
No. Please, um, I...

06:00.060 --> 06:02.294
- I've got to get on this one.
- I don't...

06:02.296 --> 06:04.776
Could you just check for,
like, a last minute
cancellation or...

06:06.399 --> 06:07.733
Please?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.409
I'm sorry, but the 3:30
is the best that we can do.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.245
- But there's...
There's got to be...

06:20.247 --> 06:22.047
I...

06:22.049 --> 06:24.683
- Hello?
<i>- Ellie? We lost him.</i>

06:24.685 --> 06:27.319
Who, what? Lost who?

06:27.321 --> 06:30.822
<i>I'm afraid we lost your daddy.
He died not two minutes ago.</i>

07:37.557 --> 07:39.991
Hey, there you are!

07:39.993 --> 07:42.127
Oh, hi!

07:42.129 --> 07:43.962
-Wait, you are Ellie,
aren't ya?
-Yeah.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.665
It's a good thing
or I might've been
arrested for being a lesbian.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.568
-Can you get arrested?
-I'm just kidding.
Is that all you have?

07:49.570 --> 07:51.002
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, come on now,
we gotta scoot.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.604
I had no idea you'd be so late.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.073
-I know.
There was a problem...
-Do you drive a truck?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.242
I guess.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.177
I might've had a few
too many cocktails
waiting for you,

07:59.179 --> 08:00.846
I'm gonna need you to drive.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.081
There you go.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.683
Oh, hang on, just a sec.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.085
Before you get in,
I wanna show you something.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.487
How's the light out here?
Can you see okay?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.155
See what?

08:10.157 --> 08:12.824
Well, what do you think?

08:13.759 --> 08:16.127
About...

08:16.129 --> 08:18.296
Well, they're
your daddy's suits.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.800
I mean, I like the brown,
but everyone else
seems to like the blue.

08:21.802 --> 08:25.303
Mmm. Maybe we can buy him
something new.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.272
Like some black.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.241
God, are you...
What a waste that'd be.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.611
Actually, can I be
100% honest with you?

08:33.614 --> 08:36.214
-Okay.
-I really don't know that your
daddy wanted to be buried.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.051
Well, what did he want?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.854
I mean, he always said
we could just shove him
under the couch.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.757
But sometimes he'd say
he wanted to be cremated.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.326
- Oh.
- Yeah.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.829
I know you know your daddy
joked around a lot.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.964
I mean, did he ever tell you
or your brother
what he wanted?

08:52.966 --> 08:55.867
Mmm-mmm,
I don't think we ever
talked about his death.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.829
Are you kidding?
He talked about that
all the time.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.771
Come on, hop in.

09:04.577 --> 09:08.213
What time's
your brother flying in?

09:08.215 --> 09:10.415
- Cole's not coming.
- He's not?

09:10.417 --> 09:12.083
Mmm-mmm.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.486
Well, I didn't know
it was quite like that.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.922
It is, and then some.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.890
So, which way am I going?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.725
Grandma!

09:20.727 --> 09:23.762
Tommy,
go back to sleep.
We'll be home soon.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.163
That's my grandson, Tommy.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.265
What, he's just been
out in the car the whole time?

09:27.267 --> 09:30.502
I couldn't exactly bring him
into the airport bar now,
could I?

09:30.504 --> 09:32.771
I'm hungry, Grandma.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.439
Okay, I'll fetch you
something. Just,
when you pull out of here,

09:34.441 --> 09:36.641
make your first right and
head down the road a while.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.881
<i>- Hello?
- -Hi, it's me.</i>

09:42.883 --> 09:44.783
<i>How was the trip?</i>

09:44.785 --> 09:47.719
Uh, it was a little...

09:47.721 --> 09:49.588
<i>Are you okay?</i>

09:49.590 --> 09:51.289
<i>Did Dad say something
awful to you?</i>

09:51.291 --> 09:54.492
No, Dad's dead.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.965
<i>Really?</i>

09:59.967 --> 10:01.967
He died while I was still
at the airport

10:01.969 --> 10:05.303
and this Amanda woman
called to tell me.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.573
<i>I don't understand,</i>
<i>so you... So you're still</i>
<i>at the airport?</i>

10:08.575 --> 10:11.710
No, I decided to come
to Texas anyway.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.412
<i>- What?</i>

10:14.414 --> 10:17.382
Um, I gotta go,
I'll, I'll call you later.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.023
Come on, get in.

10:28.427 --> 10:30.128
Why can't this just wait
until tomorrow?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.430
It just can't.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.898
Anyway, I thought
you might want
to see your daddy

10:33.900 --> 10:35.967
before they take him
over to the funeral home.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.337
I don't wanna be rude,
but I think that I can
wait to see him.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.239
Okay, look,
can I be 100% honest
with you, Ellie?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.341
Okay.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.909
Technically, me and your daddy
ain't exactly married
on account of

10:44.911 --> 10:46.277
I'm still married
to some no-good son of a bitch

10:46.279 --> 10:49.014
- who lives up near Houston.
- I don't understand.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.982
I need someone to officially
sign some forms

10:50.984 --> 10:52.784
so they can release his body
to the undertakers.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.519
- Someone who's family.
- I see.

10:55.454 --> 10:57.288
I knew you were coming,

10:57.290 --> 10:59.491
I didn't wanna make
your grandparents
have to do it.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.859
Who?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.092
Ellie?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.294
Yeah.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.616
I thought that might be you,
you look just like
your father.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.266
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.667
Thank you.

12:54.306 --> 12:55.974
What's this?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.977
Your father asked
me to give it to you
if you showed up here.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.212
Amanda, where did you
get that wheelchair?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.714
Oh, uh...

13:02.716 --> 13:04.582
These things are not toys.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.485
No, I know, Susan,
it's just he's so heavy.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.154
- You just about done here?
- Uh-huh.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.269
This is where you live?

13:24.271 --> 13:27.806
Oh, this is it.
"Be it ever so humble..."

13:27.808 --> 13:29.741
We had an apartment
down the road,

13:29.743 --> 13:32.277
but your daddy loved
to monkey around
with those guitars.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.479
This place suited him
'cause of the garage.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.514
It's my son's place.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.517
Really, it was too big
for just him and Tommy
by themselves.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.787
He was still making guitars?

13:42.789 --> 13:45.690
Oh, making 'em,
repairing old ones, sure.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.692
Yeah, he worked on 'em
most days.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.194
Don't think he ever finished
too many,

13:49.196 --> 13:51.863
but he loved working on 'em.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.599
All right, come on, love bug.
You gotta get up,
we're goin' in.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.671
Let's see.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.177
Uh, yeah.
And that's my baby boy.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.579
Jack, this is Ellie.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.714
Mark's daughter.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.283
Oh, he's a charmer.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.384
No, don't worry,
don't worry about a thing,

14:13.386 --> 14:15.720
I'll put your son to bed.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.523
He works hard, so we cut him
a little slack when he acts
like a poo-poo head.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.691
I'll be right back.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.424
There you are.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.758
I can't believe this.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.226
Oh, yeah, well.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.831
That was your daddy's.

16:06.833 --> 16:10.468
No, but he had this piece
of junk when we were kids.

16:13.505 --> 16:16.841
We used to take
the worst road trips
in this beast.

16:18.844 --> 16:20.678
And he never got it
to work right.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.780
Well, Jack got it running
for me to drive

16:22.782 --> 16:24.549
but I'm too scared
it'll break down.

16:25.918 --> 16:28.786
Who did he make the guitars for?

16:28.788 --> 16:32.256
Oh, different folks,
here and there.

16:32.258 --> 16:35.393
He'd sell a few every year,
if he'd finish 'em, anyway.

16:37.629 --> 16:41.632
Did he ever make
anything else,
like any violins or...

16:41.634 --> 16:45.636
Violins? No, I don't think so.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.006
Ellie, listen, I...
I was wondering
if you could help me

16:48.008 --> 16:51.042
with the announcement
of your daddy's death.

16:51.044 --> 16:54.512
Uh, I wasn't really
planning on staying.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.016
I might just even
get on the first plane
in the morning.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.284
But you've only been here
two minutes.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.387
And I could really
use your help, please.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.622
At least stay
until after the funeral.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.290
I know, I, I'm sorry...

17:06.291 --> 17:08.092
Isn't this the least
you could do?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.330
Okay.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.733
Sure, I'll stay
until he's in the ground.

17:16.702 --> 17:17.769
All right.

17:20.305 --> 17:24.509
You know, I'd really
like to just, um,
maybe like go for a drive.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.743
See some of the town.

17:26.746 --> 17:30.014
Well, I don't know
if there's that much
to see, but okay.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.884
But the thing is,
Jack needs his truck tonight.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.952
You can try your luck
with that thing.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.857
Is there any other way
of getting into town?

18:26.238 --> 18:28.206
Don't do that again, Billy.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.607
But I'm hungry.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.008
You said you wasn't hungry.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.518
Just...

18:43.055 --> 18:44.255
Don't you start.

18:44.257 --> 18:47.458
Don't. Billy, don't do that.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.227
Stop it.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.361
Billy, put... You...

18:51.497 --> 18:52.997
Better put that back on.

18:57.669 --> 18:58.870
You got kids of your own?

18:59.505 --> 19:01.739
No.

19:01.741 --> 19:02.940
Then why don't you
mind your own business,

19:02.942 --> 19:05.343
we ain't some TV show
for you to gawk at.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.744
G.D., woman!

20:06.638 --> 20:09.674
<i>♪ Well, I'm a wild one
to ramble</i>

20:09.676 --> 20:12.543
<i>♪ The whole world
out in front of me</i>

20:12.545 --> 20:14.912
<i>♪ I got places to go</i>

20:14.914 --> 20:17.515
<i>♪ I got people to see...</i>

20:17.517 --> 20:20.184
Is this fellow lip-syncing
to some woman?

20:20.186 --> 20:21.786
Or is he about two balls
short of a sack?

20:23.555 --> 20:26.490
<i>♪ I'm headed
for the big town... ♪</i>

20:48.747 --> 20:50.748
Hey, can I get another one?

21:01.226 --> 21:02.693
I really liked your song.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.363
At least what I heard of it.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.600
You know,
it really pisses me off.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.302
He's just wasting all that beer.

21:12.871 --> 21:15.906
Does this happen a lot?

21:15.908 --> 21:18.542
Uh, you mean,
bottles getting thrown
at my head?

21:18.544 --> 21:21.712
No, that guy
doesn't come here that often.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.298
Cheers.

21:52.411 --> 21:53.678
What you got there?

21:55.447 --> 21:56.747
Mmm, it's a key.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.819
Hold on...

22:02.654 --> 22:05.122
Is this the key to my heart?

22:05.124 --> 22:08.693
- Hey, I have been looking
everywhere for this.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.328
Yeah, I don't know
what it's for.

22:10.330 --> 22:14.298
Um, my father left it for me.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.834
He... He's just, uh...
He died.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.370
Huh.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.542
This is familiar.

22:25.777 --> 22:28.779
- Is it?
- Yeah.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.849
You know, I can't remember
where, but I saw this kind
of key before.

22:37.956 --> 22:41.058
So, you wanna
hear my new song or what?

22:41.060 --> 22:43.494
You're not gonna get
back up there again, are you?

22:43.496 --> 22:46.997
No. Uh, no. I think once
is enough for tonight.

23:00.812 --> 23:01.979
Come on, let's go.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.434
That was great.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.837
Thanks.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.740
Um, who is this?

23:30.675 --> 23:32.843
That is Brenda Thacker.

23:34.212 --> 23:37.748
Also known as my mother.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.684
Yeah, she's been in
a diabetic coma here
for three days now.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.189
I'm so sorry,
is she gonna be okay?

23:45.191 --> 23:47.892
Uh, yeah, I mean, they think so.

23:47.894 --> 23:48.959
But you know.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.596
They're not really sure.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.965
On the plus side,

23:54.967 --> 23:56.934
we never got along so well
as we have these
past three days,

23:56.936 --> 23:58.803
have we, Brenda?

24:02.741 --> 24:04.909
Do you come here every day?

24:04.911 --> 24:06.877
Mmm-hmm.

24:47.953 --> 24:48.986
Hi.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.094
Hi, um...

24:58.763 --> 25:02.366
I, uh, I don't know
where Amanda is,

25:02.368 --> 25:03.801
but I think
she might be in the back.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.269
Oh, we're here to see you.

25:06.705 --> 25:08.839
Why?

25:08.841 --> 25:10.674
Well, because
you're our granddaughter.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.110
Why wouldn't we wanna see you?

25:13.112 --> 25:15.679
Yeah, we didn't mean
to step on your beauty sleep.

25:20.218 --> 25:24.588
I carry this picture
around with me
everywhere I go.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.795
Um...

25:32.797 --> 25:34.632
Yeah, I, I remember this day.

25:35.467 --> 25:36.901
Do you have any?

25:38.336 --> 25:40.304
Any what?

25:40.306 --> 25:43.641
Uh, she wants to know
if you have any pictures
of our beautiful faces.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.211
Uh...

25:47.213 --> 25:50.014
Well, I know
you wouldn't carry them
around with you,

25:50.016 --> 25:52.650
but at home, I was wondering
if you had any.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.321
The thing is um,

25:57.323 --> 25:59.757
when Amanda mentioned you,

25:59.759 --> 26:02.993
yesterday, that was
the first time I knew

26:02.995 --> 26:05.596
that you were even alive.

26:09.267 --> 26:10.634
I, um...

26:12.103 --> 26:13.103
Daddy!

26:16.575 --> 26:19.276
Uh, I'll...
I'll be right back.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.283
Daddy!

26:26.285 --> 26:28.252
Hey, little man.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.121
- How are you?
- Good.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.890
- Where are you going, Daddy?
- I gotta go to work.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.392
May I please go?
No, no,
Daddy's gotta work.

26:35.394 --> 26:38.128
We just picked up some food
before Jack takes the truck.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.631
Yeah, somebody's
gotta work around here.

26:43.702 --> 26:46.236
-What is that supposed
to mean?
-He's cranky in the morning.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.672
Well, he wasn't much nicer
last night.

26:52.077 --> 26:54.478
Well, we keep, uh,
sneaking up on you, don't we?

26:55.948 --> 26:58.148
Oh.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.285
Oh, it is so good
to finally meet you.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.420
You too.

27:03.422 --> 27:07.458
I've thought about hugging you
and your brother
for so many years.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.461
Hopefully, this is "hello"
instead of "goodbye."

27:10.463 --> 27:13.597
And don't worry, we don't have
that many years left
to bother you.

27:13.599 --> 27:16.467
Oh, Bruce, will you be quiet?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.403
- Bye.
- Come on, hon.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.372
I let you sleep in, but now,
we gotta shake a leg.

27:23.341 --> 27:25.376
See you got
your parking skills
from your daddy.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.983
Can you talk
to the undertaker
when we get there?

27:32.985 --> 27:34.184
Why?

27:34.186 --> 27:36.353
Oh, I just don't like
those kind of folks.

27:36.355 --> 27:38.689
And I don't know
what kind of coffin
to get and...

27:38.691 --> 27:40.124
Yeah, I can talk to 'em.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.959
Oh, I just don't know
what to do.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.928
I said I'd talk to him,
it's really not a problem.

27:44.930 --> 27:49.033
It's just that I think
your daddy really did
want to be cremated.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.702
But everyone says
a body's got to be buried
to be at peace.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.270
And I don't know if that's true,

27:53.272 --> 27:55.472
but it sure
did make me feel bad.

27:55.474 --> 27:56.607
Well, you shouldn't.

27:56.609 --> 27:58.342
Mmm.

27:58.344 --> 28:02.880
I tell ya, it's like
my head is splittin' in two.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.615
I just don't know
how I can face today.

28:04.617 --> 28:08.185
I used to
rely on Mark to make
these kind of decisions.

28:08.187 --> 28:12.156
And when he couldn't,
'cause he was too drunk,
Jack would.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.491
He's been in such a mood lately.

28:14.493 --> 28:15.993
Ever since Mark
and I moved in with him

28:15.995 --> 28:18.228
he's been... Mmm!

28:20.532 --> 28:22.900
It's all just too much.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.868
Why don't we just
finish up eating

28:24.870 --> 28:26.804
and you can go home,
get a little more sleep

28:26.806 --> 28:28.906
and I can take care
of all of this?

28:28.908 --> 28:31.742
You will? You'd do that?

28:31.744 --> 28:34.745
Oh, I tell ya,
that's a huge load
off my mind.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.447
And anyway, he is your daddy.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.317
- That's right.
- Mmm.

28:40.319 --> 28:43.654
I'm gonna go ahead,
have him cremated and then
I'm gonna go back home.

28:43.656 --> 28:46.423
Good, 'cause I think
that's what he really wanted.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.392
I mean that, or for us
to bury him in the backyard.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.893
And I think that's illegal.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.663
We just rent that house.

28:52.665 --> 28:56.400
Did he have a...
A favorite place?

28:59.204 --> 29:03.073
You know, I always saw him
crossing the train tracks
in his car.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.709
He'd just stop.
Right on the tracks.

29:05.711 --> 29:08.545
Like he was trying
to speed up the process.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.715
Almost like that
was his favorite place.

29:11.717 --> 29:14.384
Mmm. I guess his body
took care of that in the end.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.686
Hmm.

29:15.688 --> 29:18.689
Mmm. Okay.

29:18.691 --> 29:20.390
Why don't you go ahead
and pay for all this

29:20.392 --> 29:22.526
and I'll just run
to the little girl's room.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.659
And it's always one of them.

29:55.661 --> 29:58.762
- Yeah.
- It is, it is.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.798
Excuse me, hi.
I was wondering if
you could help me?

30:00.800 --> 30:02.766
Sure can.
What can I do for you?

30:02.768 --> 30:05.135
I'm looking
for the funeral home.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.905
Whoa, what's wrong?
Are you suicidal?

30:07.907 --> 30:10.507
Glen, get in there
and stop that woman
from hurting herself.

30:10.509 --> 30:11.642
I'm sorry, miss.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.310
What are you sorry about?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.345
She's looking
for the funeral parlor.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.614
-Maybe somebody
she knows has died.
-Hmm.

30:17.616 --> 30:20.184
You ought to show
a little more respect.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.752
Somebody die on you, honey?

30:21.754 --> 30:24.154
- Yeah, my father.
- Oh.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.322
Mark Edwards.

30:31.029 --> 30:35.365
What's his problem?

30:35.367 --> 30:37.868
Um, I guess not
everyone around here
liked your daddy so much.

30:40.638 --> 30:41.738
Thanks.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.277
Hey!

30:48.279 --> 30:49.413
- Hi!
- Hi.

30:50.982 --> 30:54.117
My number-one fan.

30:54.119 --> 30:56.386
- You get home okay last night?
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

30:56.388 --> 30:59.957
-How's your mom?
-Uh, she is, I guess,
the same,

30:59.959 --> 31:03.060
or someone
would have called me. Yeah.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.828
Hey, do you know where
the funeral home is?

31:04.830 --> 31:06.330
I think I'm lost.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.332
Oh, you've come
to the right person, honey.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.701
I was lost for years. Come on.

31:16.741 --> 31:19.042
I mean, I like how thin
I look in black,

31:19.044 --> 31:22.913
-but I don't really think
that's a concern here.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.848
Do you have it
in a different color?

31:24.850 --> 31:27.317
Hmm, no, ma'am,
it just comes in black.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.487
Okay, well...

31:30.489 --> 31:33.323
Let's just go with the black.

31:33.325 --> 31:37.094
Well, I like the black.
Makes me think of Johnny Cash.

31:37.096 --> 31:39.663
You know, we can do
a nice inscription on the urn.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.432
Perhaps, your father's name?

31:42.434 --> 31:45.402
What would she need
the name for?

31:45.404 --> 31:47.104
You think she has
like 20 different urns
around the house...

31:47.106 --> 31:48.939
- she might get all mixed up?

31:48.941 --> 31:50.741
Or perhaps, his favorite poem?

31:52.510 --> 31:54.177
I don't think he had one.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.914
Well, it would look real nice
with a Texas flag,

31:56.916 --> 31:59.316
- or, maybe, a fishing theme?
- What?

31:59.851 --> 32:01.718
Or golf?

32:01.720 --> 32:05.188
Just a simple urn, Mr. Harris.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.624
As you wish.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.727
Now, normally,
the casket is displayed
at the front of the chapel.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.796
But for a cremation, what we do

32:12.798 --> 32:15.465
is place a nice framed photo
of your father on the table,

32:15.467 --> 32:17.868
or you can use several photos.

32:17.870 --> 32:20.704
Now, we've recently
redone the sound system there,

32:20.706 --> 32:22.706
we have a real good selection

32:22.708 --> 32:25.342
of soothing tape music
that you can choose from...

32:29.314 --> 32:30.314
You okay?

32:31.816 --> 32:33.016
I think so.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.486
What next?

32:38.389 --> 32:39.623
I need boxes.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.135
You're not planning on taking
all those boxes?

32:52.737 --> 32:54.738
I was gonna pay for 'em.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.139
Those are all
my big boxes, though.

32:58.609 --> 33:01.979
Well, are these boxes for sale
or not?

33:01.981 --> 33:04.081
-Yeah, but...
-Well, there's no
"Yeah, but..."

33:04.083 --> 33:06.583
They're either for sale,
or they're not.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.921
Look,
I don't want this kind
of person in my store.

33:13.758 --> 33:16.660
His name is Reno,
he can be here if he wants.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.462
Ellie, let's just go.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.831
Oh, God. See, what is that?

33:20.833 --> 33:22.032
What?
What are you talking about?

33:22.034 --> 33:24.334
She's tracking mud
all inside the store.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.004
What are you talking about?
I can't see anything.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.972
Yeah, there's filth,
and dirt, and...

33:28.974 --> 33:31.375
- Okay, crazy.
- Can't we just go?

33:31.377 --> 33:34.177
No, my father is dead,
I gotta pack up his shit.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.980
Yeah, we all know
who your father was, don't we?

33:36.982 --> 33:38.648
Always scheming to get money
out of people.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.684
No wonder he couldn't
stand up straight.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.566
He's lucky he didn't run over
any innocent kids
driving drunk like he did.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.124
You know what?

33:47.126 --> 33:49.192
I don't want any of your...

33:49.194 --> 33:52.295
- Fucking boxes!
- Okay. Ellie, let's just go.

33:52.297 --> 33:53.897
- You guys need
to get out of here.
Fine by us.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.999
You can stay here. You can be
King of the Box World.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.868
And you can stay here
until the day that you die.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.736
And, oh, shit! Look...

33:59.738 --> 34:02.706
My shoes are fucking dirty too!

34:05.076 --> 34:07.310
Idiot! I wanna burn
his store down.

34:07.312 --> 34:09.746
That seems a little extreme.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.549
Well, he's just a jerk.
He doesn't like you,
he doesn't like my father.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.190
Yeah, well,
he probably doesn't like you
too much right now, either.

34:19.157 --> 34:21.324
Come on, I know
where we can get some,
uh, used boxes.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.502
Tommy, stop that jumping.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.775
What are we gonna do
with all this stuff?

34:38.777 --> 34:40.510
Well, whatever Reno doesn't want

34:40.512 --> 34:42.379
I'm gonna take along
to Goodwill.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.614
- Where is your friend?
- Trying something on.

34:45.617 --> 34:48.819
Oh. I just don't think I could
wear a dead man's clothes.

34:49.620 --> 34:50.719
Why not?

34:50.722 --> 34:53.090
Well, they're dead.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.658
Doesn't seem right.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.530
Check it out!

35:00.532 --> 35:02.432
These are some fly threads, man.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.134
-Are you sure
I can keep these?
-Yeah.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.369
Don't really seem
to fit you too good.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.038
Oh, I can take care of that.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.374
Well.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.548
And then, you can clamp it down

35:18.550 --> 35:20.317
and it makes different sounds
on the strings.

35:21.486 --> 35:22.786
Are you going to play?

35:27.258 --> 35:29.025
Hey, you ever play
an instrument?

35:30.561 --> 35:32.629
No. Not really.

35:33.664 --> 35:35.632
But when I was eight,

35:36.400 --> 35:38.535
my dad made me a violin.

35:39.403 --> 35:41.905
And...

35:41.907 --> 35:45.075
I mean, I was too young
to actually play it,
but I loved it.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.478
I carried it with me everywhere.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.517
Uh...

35:53.519 --> 35:55.385
He sold it when we were broke.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.299
I can't believe
that he kept all this.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.601
Like, all of our
report cards, and...

36:15.373 --> 36:16.873
And, what?

36:18.609 --> 36:20.677
These letters I wrote him
when I left.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.082
I was so harsh.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.657
Tommy, go on in,
get ready for soccer.

36:33.659 --> 36:34.958
Your daddy can't get out
of work in time,

36:34.960 --> 36:36.693
so I'm gonna have
to run you over there.

36:39.163 --> 36:40.697
Come on, git! Let's go.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.572
Amanda.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.373
What is it, hon?

36:50.375 --> 36:51.741
Why don't I take Tommy
to soccer?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.412
You'd wanna do that?

36:55.414 --> 36:57.147
Yeah, yeah,
I, I think it'll be fun.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.051
Great. Yeah, give me a chance
to make some calls.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.553
I think we're gonna have
a full house at this memorial.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.725
Run, run.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.732
Other way, other way.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.404
Let's go, Tommy!

37:26.043 --> 37:28.445
Hey, how's it going out there?

37:28.447 --> 37:30.680
He's doing great, you know,
he's kicking that ball.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.350
Has anybody scored yet?

37:34.218 --> 37:35.452
Hard to say.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.254
You touched it.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.789
- You don't know
anything about soccer, do you?
- Nope.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.157
Out of the game!

37:42.360 --> 37:44.227
Where's my mom?

37:44.229 --> 37:46.129
Oh, she'd had
a few too many drinks.

37:48.799 --> 37:50.166
You brought him?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.435
Yeah.

37:54.639 --> 37:56.106
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.

37:58.442 --> 38:01.811
She's a handful. She's always
just relying on other people.

38:13.224 --> 38:15.058
- Some tea?
- Yeah, thanks.

38:22.767 --> 38:24.334
Are you gonna come
to the memorial?

38:26.604 --> 38:27.637
Tommy wants to go.

38:30.775 --> 38:32.676
You didn't like
my father much, did you?

38:35.646 --> 38:38.548
Well, he kept my mom busy.
That was something.

38:39.583 --> 38:41.117
That's funny, I don't...

38:41.119 --> 38:43.653
You say that he kept
her busy, rather than...

38:45.523 --> 38:47.023
"He made her happy."

38:47.025 --> 38:49.292
Look, it's tough living
with drunks.

38:49.294 --> 38:52.095
I put up with her
'cause she's my mom, but...

38:52.097 --> 38:55.465
You know, your dad...

38:55.467 --> 38:58.535
He's happy one day,
and mean as hell the next.

38:58.537 --> 39:02.038
He'd throw me some money
if he sold one of those
guitars, but...

39:02.040 --> 39:04.841
It was just hard to get him
to focus long enough
to finish anything.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.077
Yeah. I mean, I know that
he was tough to live with.

39:08.279 --> 39:09.746
I grew up with him.

39:10.214 --> 39:11.581
Yeah.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.586
But you ain't really been
around much lately.

39:20.391 --> 39:21.691
Hmm, I thought...

39:23.394 --> 39:24.894
I don't know what I thought.

39:27.231 --> 39:28.631
I never thought he'd die.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.470
Just thought we'd have
some more time.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.210
Was he that bad
when you were younger?

39:48.386 --> 39:49.753
When I was 11,

39:51.522 --> 39:53.490
my parents took us
to this party.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.158
It was, like, a barbecue

39:55.160 --> 39:56.993
at a friend's place
outside of town.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.229
And, um,

40:00.064 --> 40:02.565
he got really...

40:02.567 --> 40:05.168
You know, drunk, and...

40:05.170 --> 40:07.650
When it was time to leave,
he wouldn't give my mom
the car keys.

40:08.773 --> 40:12.041
He drove, and, uh...

40:12.043 --> 40:13.943
You know, we were swerving

40:16.013 --> 40:18.081
and he went to

40:18.083 --> 40:22.118
change the music
on the stereo and we wrecked.

40:24.622 --> 40:25.789
And it seemed like...

40:27.758 --> 40:31.127
forever till
the ambulance got there.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.299
He was friends
with the sheriff 'cause...

40:37.268 --> 40:38.268
he walked.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.774
And we were all fine
except for my mom.

40:47.411 --> 40:48.878
She died the next day.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.017
So...

40:54.585 --> 40:56.586
Yeah.

40:56.588 --> 41:00.623
He was pretty bad back then.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.692
Not much changes with time,
I guess.

41:05.563 --> 41:06.729
I'm really sorry.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.236
Did you, uh, did you live
with him after that?

41:13.238 --> 41:14.737
For a while,

41:14.739 --> 41:17.474
yeah, um...

41:17.476 --> 41:20.577
He got a lot worse,
and then when my brother

41:20.579 --> 41:23.079
went off to college,
that's when I moved in
with my aunt.

41:29.420 --> 41:31.754
What about Tommy's mom?
She just out the picture?

41:33.858 --> 41:35.692
She's alive,
if you wanna call it that.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.830
She's a junkie.

41:43.767 --> 41:44.934
I never even suspected it.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.771
I knew about alcohol,
obviously, but...

41:50.875 --> 41:52.709
I didn't know anything
about the drugs.

41:56.213 --> 41:57.447
I just...

41:59.984 --> 42:03.820
Seems like I blinked,
and I was married.

42:03.822 --> 42:06.556
I blinked again,
and I was divorced,
with a little boy.

42:09.793 --> 42:12.262
I blinked again,
that little boy
is almost five years old.

42:14.798 --> 42:17.267
I just wonder
how you get things
to slow down a little bit.

42:20.237 --> 42:22.205
I don't wanna blink
and be in the grave.

42:23.507 --> 42:26.409
Yeah.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.411
It seems like that happens
to a lot of people.

42:43.227 --> 42:46.696

44:04.976 --> 44:07.377
What are you laughing at, huh?

44:11.582 --> 44:13.983
You want something
to laugh about? You do?

44:13.985 --> 44:15.351
You do?

44:15.353 --> 44:17.020
Uh-huh.

44:17.022 --> 44:18.488
Are you ticklish?

44:18.490 --> 44:20.490
You better watch it,
he's gonna wet himself.

44:20.492 --> 44:22.959
Oh, I am willing
to take that chance.

44:28.966 --> 44:30.700
So, what does this do?

44:30.702 --> 44:34.037
It's for seniors
who have trouble rising
from their chairs.

44:34.039 --> 44:35.872
What you do is you hit a button,

44:35.874 --> 44:38.174
and then,
the armrests would rise

44:38.176 --> 44:40.143
and it would be like people
on either side of you

44:40.145 --> 44:42.111
helping you up out of the chair.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.946
- Dang, I'd buy one of those.
- Yeah?

44:43.948 --> 44:46.349
Yeah. Heck, I'd buy
two of 'em.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.718
Where do I order?

44:48.720 --> 44:51.320
Oh, it's just an idea
that I'm working on.

44:51.322 --> 44:54.023
I have no way of getting
these things made.

44:54.025 --> 44:57.226
Well, you sure won't unless
you show 'em to someone.

44:57.228 --> 44:58.961
- Here it is!
- Uh-oh.

44:58.963 --> 45:02.699
I knew I brought it.
I left it in the car.

45:02.701 --> 45:05.401
And here's something I found.

45:09.907 --> 45:12.909
Your father always loved
to ride.

45:12.911 --> 45:14.243
- Did he?
- Yeah.

45:14.245 --> 45:16.879
He wasn't any kind of a cowboy.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.382
He couldn't rope a steer
to save his life,

45:19.384 --> 45:22.085
but he loved to ride.

45:22.087 --> 45:25.722
Oh, and this was some dance
or other.

45:25.724 --> 45:27.824
Your father loved to cut a rug.

45:27.826 --> 45:30.026
Yeah, he was
a pretty good dancer.

45:30.028 --> 45:32.995
-There's this, uh, old gal
that he took to the prom...
-Mmm-hmm.

45:32.997 --> 45:35.264
And she still talks
about how your daddy

45:35.266 --> 45:39.102
was the best dance partner
she ever had.

45:39.104 --> 45:42.538
Oh, uh,
that was the last picture

45:42.540 --> 45:45.074
where he was still our boy.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.610
It was, uh...

45:47.612 --> 45:49.612
It was while he was in the Navy,

45:49.614 --> 45:52.415
that all the drinking
started up.

45:55.286 --> 45:58.087
Normally, you can't squeeze
a tear out of me.

45:59.356 --> 46:00.590
Tell her, Bruce.

46:00.592 --> 46:03.292
Why, she's a tough old bird,

46:03.294 --> 46:06.696
but we're having a tough week.

46:06.698 --> 46:10.133
And I expect it's, uh,
not been too much
fun for you, either.

46:12.870 --> 46:16.606
All right,
here we go.
Chocolate shake...

46:47.638 --> 46:48.838
Hey, Reno.

46:49.773 --> 46:51.340
Hey.

46:51.342 --> 46:52.909
What's up?

46:52.911 --> 46:55.244
Uh...

46:55.246 --> 46:57.580
I got a call from the hospital.

46:57.582 --> 46:58.881
Is your mom okay?

47:00.083 --> 47:02.585
Well, I guess yes and no.

47:05.622 --> 47:07.523
Well, it's not like
she's a little bitty thing

47:07.525 --> 47:09.025
that you can really misplace
too easily.

47:09.027 --> 47:10.993
Hey, there, Reno,
thanks for coming in.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.129
Oh, hey! Should I have brought
a picture of my mom,

47:13.131 --> 47:14.430
so we can start up
a search party?

47:14.432 --> 47:16.866
We didn't misplace her.

47:16.868 --> 47:18.534
She must have woke up,
got dressed,

47:18.536 --> 47:20.369
and decided
to check herself out.

47:30.480 --> 47:31.714
Should we go in?

47:33.817 --> 47:35.218
In a minute.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.222
You think I look like her?

47:41.391 --> 47:42.625
Not so much.

47:44.995 --> 47:46.696
You know, she's eating herself
to death.

47:51.235 --> 47:52.468
Are you okay?

47:56.473 --> 47:58.474
Ever had a nightmare...

47:59.977 --> 48:02.044
That was so bad, you had
to get up out of the bed

48:02.046 --> 48:03.746
just to try and
walk away from it?

48:05.849 --> 48:06.849
Yeah.

48:10.254 --> 48:11.754
I have this nightmare

48:14.391 --> 48:16.626
where I'm sitting
at a table with my mom,

48:18.328 --> 48:20.630
just feeding her,
and feeding her...

48:24.401 --> 48:26.836
And I wanna get up,
I wanna leave, but...

48:28.071 --> 48:29.739
I can't.

48:36.513 --> 48:40.349
Well, I think there's no use
in just crying our eyes out.

48:57.701 --> 48:59.602
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, there.

49:00.404 --> 49:02.438
I think they're, um,

49:02.440 --> 49:05.207
looking for you
back at the hospital.

49:05.209 --> 49:07.529
Yeah, I woke up there
this morning.
What was all that about?

49:09.146 --> 49:10.746
Uh...

49:10.748 --> 49:13.582
I found you passed out
in the kitchen
the other night,

49:13.584 --> 49:15.718
and then they said
that you were
in a diabetic coma.

49:18.221 --> 49:20.823
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my friend, Ellie.

49:20.825 --> 49:22.558
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.628
Are you feeling better?

49:25.630 --> 49:27.964
I never felt bad.

49:27.966 --> 49:29.398
I can tell you
I sure was hungry, though,

49:29.400 --> 49:32.601
when I woke up this morning.

49:32.603 --> 49:34.937
Hey, you know, we should just
swing you by the hospital.

49:34.939 --> 49:36.305
Oh, no,
I'm not going back there.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.474
Uh, well, they might have
a list of foods

49:38.476 --> 49:40.977
for you to avoid,
and medication
for you to take.

49:40.979 --> 49:44.099
You pop on by there tomorrow
and pick that stuff up for me,
would you, Margaret?

49:44.848 --> 49:45.848
Mom.

49:46.483 --> 49:47.650
I mean, Reno.

49:49.319 --> 49:52.688
- So, who's your friend?
- Uh...

49:52.690 --> 49:56.025
She's in town 'cause her,
her father died.

49:56.027 --> 49:59.128
Uh, Mark Edwards?
Did you know him?

49:59.130 --> 50:01.330
I knew him just to wave at.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.432
-I know his momma
pretty well, though.
-Mmm-hmm.

50:06.103 --> 50:09.205
-You feel like doing
some sewing?
-Oh, sure.

50:09.207 --> 50:10.740
Let me just grab
a Blizzard to go.

50:14.044 --> 50:15.611
Okay, but make the pants
nice and tight, Mom.

50:15.613 --> 50:16.679
You know how I like 'em.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.214
I reckon I ought to by now.

50:22.352 --> 50:25.521
Hey, so, Ellie thinks
I should record
some of my songs.

50:25.523 --> 50:28.324
And move out of town
and become a fancy musician?

50:32.162 --> 50:34.563
Well, I think those songs
are too good
to keep to yourself.

50:37.734 --> 50:39.568
No, I'm not gonna leave
this place.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.506
Yeah, well, I gotta go.

50:43.508 --> 50:46.475
Do you need a ride
to the funeral home tomorrow?

50:46.477 --> 50:47.777
I can just meet you there.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.712
Bye.

51:52.476 --> 51:54.477
Close your eyes,
and just go to sleep.

51:54.479 --> 51:57.246
Does Ellie live here now?

51:57.248 --> 51:59.982
No, she's just here
'cause her daddy passed away.

51:59.984 --> 52:02.551
Would you let her live here
if she wanted to?

52:04.654 --> 52:06.822
I think she's got
a life back where she lives.

52:07.924 --> 52:10.226
Go on, close your eyes,
go to bed.

52:12.596 --> 52:13.863
Go to sleep, okay?

52:25.742 --> 52:26.976
This used to be my field.

52:28.178 --> 52:30.346
You owned a baseball field?

52:30.348 --> 52:33.415
No, I used to go to school here.

52:33.417 --> 52:36.152
I was one of the best players
we had.

52:36.154 --> 52:38.634
I had scholarships
to play baseball
at three different colleges.

52:39.523 --> 52:41.423
What position did you play?

52:41.425 --> 52:43.592
I was a pitcher, but...

52:44.928 --> 52:46.529
I played third base too.

52:46.531 --> 52:47.763
What college did you go to?

52:51.301 --> 52:52.501
I didn't. I never left.

52:55.705 --> 52:56.705
Why not?

52:59.543 --> 53:02.378
I hurt my arm pretty bad
and I couldn't
pitch anymore and then...

53:04.881 --> 53:07.583
-I got Tommy's mom pregnant
a couple of years later.
-Yeah.

53:10.887 --> 53:12.454
I thought I got her pregnant.

53:15.158 --> 53:17.693
- What do you mean?
- You've seen him.

53:20.030 --> 53:21.630
He doesn't look
anything like me.

53:25.068 --> 53:28.070
I told you his mom
was an addict.

53:28.072 --> 53:30.706
She used to do all kind
of shit behind my back
to get drugs.

53:34.978 --> 53:36.978
Thought about getting
one of those paternity tests.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.553
Does it really matter?

53:44.555 --> 53:45.754
What do you mean by that?

53:48.892 --> 53:50.793
Well, Tommy is such a great kid.

53:53.096 --> 53:57.700
I see your eyes
just light up whenever
he walks into the room.

53:57.702 --> 54:01.303
So, does it really matter
if he's not
your biological son?

54:04.441 --> 54:05.741
I don't know.

54:12.849 --> 54:16.118
You are 100% the father
that he needs.

54:18.521 --> 54:20.823
And you're much more
of a father than mine
ever was.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.841
- Good morning.
- Hi.

54:52.255 --> 54:54.590
You know, I think I might
wanna wear my hair up.

54:54.592 --> 54:56.925
Mmm-hmm.

54:56.927 --> 54:59.628
I haven't worn my hair up
in 10 years.

55:00.730 --> 55:03.065
But this is a memorial

55:03.067 --> 55:04.867
and I think it might be
the right thing to do.

55:06.403 --> 55:07.403
Yeah, sure.

55:09.406 --> 55:10.526
You think you could help me?

55:13.443 --> 55:18.480
Well, I met your daddy
right down the road
at Charlie's Bar.

55:18.482 --> 55:21.050
But I guess that's not
such a big shock, is it?

55:21.818 --> 55:24.119
No, not really.

55:24.121 --> 55:26.355
Yeah, he bought me a drink
and he told me that
he had just moved back here

55:26.357 --> 55:29.091
to his hometown to die.

55:29.093 --> 55:31.493
And that's exactly what he did.

55:31.495 --> 55:34.630
Of course, it took him
a little over five years
to do it,

55:34.632 --> 55:36.165
but he was true to his word.

55:41.504 --> 55:44.773
I don't know.
I mean, you seem like
a nice enough girl.

55:45.775 --> 55:47.476
Nice enough for what?

55:47.478 --> 55:49.812
Well...

55:49.814 --> 55:51.480
I just don't know
that I'll ever understand

55:51.482 --> 55:53.115
what you and your brother
have done.

55:55.051 --> 55:57.653
- What we've done?
- To your daddy.

55:57.655 --> 56:00.622
I mean, it seems like you all
just left his well-being

56:00.624 --> 56:02.558
in the hands
of complete strangers.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.360
I mean, it so happens
that I care for him

56:04.362 --> 56:06.628
and I found him
this place to live,

56:06.630 --> 56:08.564
but it does seem like
y'all didn't care if he was
living on the street,

56:08.566 --> 56:10.232
dumpster-diving for his meals.

56:10.234 --> 56:12.368
You, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

56:12.370 --> 56:14.303
Look, I know
Mark had his problems...

56:14.305 --> 56:16.972
His problems?
Do you know how many different
schools I had to go to

56:16.974 --> 56:19.541
because my father got fired
and we had to move
to a different town

56:19.543 --> 56:22.077
where nobody knew about him
or his problems?

56:22.079 --> 56:23.479
And I'm sure that was hard.

56:23.481 --> 56:25.013
And walking home from school

56:25.015 --> 56:26.682
with the few friends
that I was able to make

56:26.684 --> 56:28.384
and I see all of our belongings,

56:28.386 --> 56:30.219
all of my toys

56:30.221 --> 56:32.388
and clothes being sold
in a yard sale

56:32.390 --> 56:35.224
so that he would have enough
gas money to leave town.

56:35.226 --> 56:36.925
Look, Ellie, I didn't mean...

56:36.927 --> 56:38.527
Or seeing my mother
being carried away
in an ambulance

56:38.529 --> 56:39.995
'cause he wouldn't give her
the car keys.

56:39.997 --> 56:41.230
- What?
- He killed her,

56:41.232 --> 56:43.766
and I still loved him.

56:43.768 --> 56:47.236
So how does that
make any fucking sense?

56:47.238 --> 56:49.671
No. No, that can't be right,
that can't be true.

56:49.673 --> 56:50.739
"Can't be"...
Just forget about it.

56:50.741 --> 56:53.075
Hey. Hey! What about my hair?

56:53.077 --> 56:54.777
Wear a hat!

56:54.779 --> 56:56.745
You're just so selfish.
You and your father, both.

56:56.747 --> 56:59.281
Don't think I haven't noticed.

56:59.283 --> 57:02.584
What about you?
You rely on your son
to put a roof over your head,

57:02.586 --> 57:04.353
and you can't even
look after his kid.

57:04.355 --> 57:05.721
Why don't you
have another drink?

57:05.723 --> 57:07.189
Why don't you forget
about it just like my father?

57:07.191 --> 57:09.425
What do you know
about anything, huh?

57:09.427 --> 57:11.627
I had a baby boy
and I was married
a week out of high school,

57:11.629 --> 57:14.730
and I have been trying
to catch up ever since,
just trying to...

57:14.732 --> 57:15.964
So what do you know?

57:15.966 --> 57:17.466
You come on back here
when you're my age

57:17.468 --> 57:19.535
and you tell me
if you did everything right.

57:19.537 --> 57:21.537
You come on back
and tell me how it went.

57:24.208 --> 57:25.474
Shit...

57:54.304 --> 57:55.637
<i>Hey, Ellie, what's up?</i>

57:55.639 --> 57:57.239
Hi, James.

57:57.241 --> 57:58.974
<i>Hey, I came by your place
last night.</i>

57:58.976 --> 58:01.176
<i>Did you hear me knocking?</i>

58:01.178 --> 58:02.678
I'm still in Texas.

58:03.947 --> 58:06.982
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's right.</i>

58:06.984 --> 58:09.151
I came here 'cause of my father.

58:09.153 --> 58:10.419
<i>Yeah.</i>

58:12.822 --> 58:14.923
So, this is typically the moment

58:14.925 --> 58:16.625
when a boyfriend
would ask a girlfriend

58:16.627 --> 58:18.861
if her father's
doing okay or not.

58:18.863 --> 58:21.763
<i>You know</i>
<i>I don't like to deal</i>
<i>with sick people.</i>

58:21.765 --> 58:22.831
<i>You know that.</i>

58:25.702 --> 58:27.970
James, I think
we should break up.

58:27.972 --> 58:30.672
<i>What? But I love you.
What are you...</i>

58:30.674 --> 58:34.610
No, you're not the kind of guy
who should really date anyone,

58:34.612 --> 58:36.778
you know, you're more like
a fun one-night stand

58:36.780 --> 58:39.781
and somehow I've let this
continue for a year.

58:40.650 --> 58:43.318
<i>You think I'm fun?</i>

58:43.320 --> 58:47.623
Uh... James, I don't think
we should date anymore.

58:48.558 --> 58:50.459
<i>Starting when?</i>

58:50.461 --> 58:52.461
When I hang up the phone.

58:52.463 --> 58:54.763
<i>Well, in that case</i>
<i>I won't let you</i>
<i>hang up the phone...</i>

59:06.175 --> 59:07.643
Are we early?

59:07.645 --> 59:08.777
I don't think so.

59:33.269 --> 59:36.004
<i>Hello, everyone,
and thanks for coming.</i>

59:36.006 --> 59:38.440
<i>I'd like to say a few words
about Mark Edwards,</i>

59:38.442 --> 59:41.376
<i>who may not have been</i>
<i>my legal husband</i>
<i>here in Texas,</i>

59:41.378 --> 59:44.613
<i>but who will be, I know,</i>
<i>waiting for me</i>
<i>at the altar of heaven.</i>

59:44.615 --> 59:45.914
Where's the body?

59:45.916 --> 59:47.449
<i>Excuse me?</i>

59:47.451 --> 59:50.552
I said,
"Where's the body?"

59:50.554 --> 59:52.087
<i>I heard what you said, Roger,</i>

59:52.089 --> 59:53.956
<i>and I'm saying
I was still talking.</i>

59:53.958 --> 59:56.224
Well, I'm talking now, ain't I?

59:56.226 --> 59:58.794
And this is
a memorial service, isn't it?

59:58.796 --> 01:00:01.930
So I hope you're not planning
on rolling out the casket

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.365
like a birthday cake.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:04.900
<i>Roger, if I could
just finish, please?</i>

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.636
Would you like
to take a step outside?
Get some fresh air?

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:10.305
Oh, something stinks in here,
all right,

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:11.740
but I ain't fixing to move.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:13.809
Well, maybe
you'd just like to...

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:17.479
Who the hell are you?

01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:20.582
I'm Ellie.
I'm Mark's daughter.

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:24.219
So now, the ungrateful
kids show up.

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:26.488
You looking
for a little money, are you?

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:29.591
Roger, you need to button it,
and button it fast.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.828
Drunk as a skunk and the sun
isn't even down yet.

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:34.730
Drunk as skunk!

01:00:34.732 --> 01:00:36.598
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>You know, I spent a lot</i>
<i>of time thinking about</i>

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.433
<i>what I was gonna say up here</i>

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:39.968
<i>and y'all need</i>
<i>to sit on down</i>
<i>and get ready to cry!</i>

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.770
I'm fixing to cry, all right.

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:44.573
This whole freak show
is gonna make me cry!

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:46.942
And I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:49.678
where is my friend's body?

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.447
It was my father's wish
to be cremated

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:54.249
- and that is what we...
- Cremated?

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:55.851
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:00:55.853 --> 01:00:58.353
Your daddy didn't want to be
burned to a crisp.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.122
Well, apparently he did.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.424
Good God almighty!
Did you hear that?

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:03.925
Did you hear her?

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:06.828
- Oh... Oh, I see.
- No.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.598
So, now you're gonna
sic your goon squad on me,
is that it?

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.666
It's okay, Jack.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.135
No, nobody is gonna hurt you.

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:16.371
Can you imagine?
Getting beat up at the wake
of your best friend?

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:19.174
<i>Oh, Christ, he was
hardly your best friend.</i>

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.810
I knew him for about 50 years,

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.879
that's more than
the rest of you can say.

01:01:23.881 --> 01:01:27.315
And you've done this all wrong.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:29.384
I can see that you're upset.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:32.487
You burnt up his body,
you got that picture of him
from the Navy,

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:34.456
he hated the damn Navy,

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:36.658
you got this freaking...

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.326
Okay, that's it.
You have to get out!

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:40.529
- Get off of me.
- Out!

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.197
- Get off of me.
- Out, now!

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:44.066
- No, get out!
- Ahhh!

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:45.400
Oh, God.

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:46.601
Hey, just... Just...

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:01.483
Oh!

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:08.957
That's right.

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:16.364
<i>All right.</i>

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:18.133
<i>Let's pick up
where we left off, shall we?</i>

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.072
Ellie?

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.708
You spend more time
in this hospital than I do.

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:28.810
This is the last time,
I promise.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:36.218
How can you be so sure
it's your last time here?

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.554
'Cause, basically, I'm gonna
throw my clothes into a bag

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:41.396
and catch the first plane
out of here tomorrow.

01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:46.762
- Hey.
- Reno, hey, are you okay?

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.363
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Y'all can leave.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:49.631
I got to wait for some stitches.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:51.466
- No, we can wait.
- No, no, no.

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:53.568
I need to go home
and check on my mom
after anyway.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:55.370
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.205
How's the cut?
Is it gonna leave a scar?

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.075
I hope so.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.610
Not very interesting until
you have a bunch of scars

01:03:01.612 --> 01:03:04.212
you can tell
a bunch of lies about.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:06.882
Go, get out of here. I'm fine.

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.984
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:27.235
Can we leave it on,
for a minute?

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.838
Yeah, sure.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.507
My father
used to love this song.

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:39.614
My brother thinks
we lost my father years ago,

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.583
you know, after the accident.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:45.720
Is that how you feel?

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.060
I think he was still
in there somewhere.

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:57.365
Tell me something about him.

01:03:58.601 --> 01:03:59.868
Like what?

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.405
First good thing
that pops in your head.

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:09.444
You know, he was
in all kinds of bands.

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:14.115
And then he met my mom
and she was singing
in a band in Nashville.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.450
- For real?
- Yeah.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:17.018
So you're like
a show business kid?

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:21.122
No.

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:23.724
I mean, they quit all that
by the time my brother
and I came along.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.727
But...

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:29.464
And she used to...

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:31.800
Sing around the house,
and, you know...

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.606
I bet she was a great lady.

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:42.237
Hey, what are you doing?

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:43.872
Hey.

01:05:43.874 --> 01:05:45.740
Nothing.

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:48.310
Just thought I,
uh, lost something.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.377
What'd you lose?

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:50.745
I don't know.

01:05:50.747 --> 01:05:52.580
You don't know
what you might've lost?

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:55.116
Guess that's gonna take you
a while to find that.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.685
Is there anything
that you wanted?

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:03.558
I see you got your bag
packed and waiting
by the front door.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:07.595
- Yeah. I'm, I'm leaving.
- You are.

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:09.230
I mean, I came
to say goodbye to my dad

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:11.633
and that's more or less
what I did.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:14.269
Well...

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:16.504
They called and said that, um,

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:18.906
they'd have
your daddy's ashes ready
if you want to take them.

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:22.777
No.

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:24.679
Thank you, though.

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:26.348
What do you want me
to do with them?

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.484
You could keep 'em.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:33.455
Or you could
scatter 'em someplace.

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:35.256
You know what,
I don't think I could do that.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:37.425
Well, I'm sure
you'll think of something.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:39.828
Okay.

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:53.475
Should you be doing that?

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:55.637
Hmm? This bandage is
just not really my style,
you know?

01:06:58.381 --> 01:06:59.381
How does it look?

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:01.583
Not great.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.820
Do you think
anyone will believe me

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.288
if I said I got it
in a shark attack?

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:17.198
Hey, what time
does your flight leave?

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.733
Leaves at 9:00.

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:24.239
-You don't have to stay
if you don't want.
-No, no, no.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.573
You know, if we got
all this time

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.375
there's something
you could help me with.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:35.083
Where exactly are we going?

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:37.018
Hold on, I think I saw one
right up here.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.653
One what?

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:39.954
Here, here, here.
Pull up here.

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:45.860
Wh...
Why do you want this thing?

01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:47.529
I have an idea.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:49.597
Can't we just buy one of these?

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.166
Oh, I already got a bunch.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:55.770
Is this like your thing?

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.073
- My thing?
- Yeah.

01:07:58.075 --> 01:08:02.577
Yeah. Like,
you like to collect stolen
bird-feeders?

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:06.247
How could that
be anyone's thing?

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:09.117
- Quick now, you
ain't getting any lighter.

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:11.019
- Can you get it or not?
- Yeah, got it.

01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:12.454
Oh!

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.422
Run!

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.930
- What is that?
- Hold this, tools.

01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:25.033
Tools for what?

01:08:25.035 --> 01:08:28.103
Tools to help us
get into the store.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:31.538
That is breaking
and entering
where I come from.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:33.508
Yeah? That's what
we call it here too.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.993
Now what?

01:09:36.604 --> 01:09:39.073
My plane leaves in 10 minutes.

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:44.612
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.348
You're not ready to leave yet.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.783
Hmm, I'm not?

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:51.386
No, you just got here.

01:09:53.288 --> 01:09:56.257
I remember when I saw Amanda
at the airport.

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.527
I thought,

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:03.398
"God, would it be really rude

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.867
"if I was to get on an airplane

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:09.037
- "turn right around
and go home?"

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:15.610
Yeah.
This place sucks.

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:21.983
I think you should come out
to Los Angeles.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.888
You could record some songs.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.828
I think you need
to get out of this place.

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:39.133
I can't.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.471
My mom, you know.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:48.776
Anyway, I'd sooner be dead
than set foot on an airplane.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:50.945
What?

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.881
You can get up and you can sing

01:10:53.883 --> 01:10:56.451
in front of a whole bar
of people who are
throwing shit at you

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:58.586
and you're too scared
to get on an airplane?

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.623
I'm not scared.
I'll get on one as long as
it don't take off the ground.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.771
Hey!

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:19.040
Well, what are you two
doing here?

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:21.209
Oh, I'm calling the cops.
That's for damn sure.

01:11:21.211 --> 01:11:23.051
I can't even look at all that.
It's everywhere.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:51.773
Oh, wow!

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.641
Yeah, "Oh, wow!"

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:19.600
Well, I guess this is it.

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.005
I guess.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.418
Uh...

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:42.857
I uh, meant to tell you.

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:45.793
I saw where, um,
your key came from.

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.229
My mom has one like it.

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:50.598
It's uh,
for a safety deposit box
at the bank.

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.135
Okay.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.040
Reno!

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:02.977
Thank you.

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:45.186
- Hi.
- Morning.

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:47.321
Uh, is this key for your bank?

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.191
I believe it is. Let me see.

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.003
I'll give you some privacy.

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:40.334
-Hi.
-Hi, uh, I'm here to pick up
my father's ashes.

01:15:40.336 --> 01:15:43.638
Well, yes, but we've run into
a slight problem with the urn.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.373
With the urn?

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:48.075
The one you selected
is not available right now

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:51.479
and we have completely run out.

01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:55.850
Well, is there a different urn
that I can put the ashes in?

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:59.387
The one you purchased
is the most
competitively priced urn

01:15:59.389 --> 01:16:00.988
that we have and...

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.890
Well, if you'd want
to upgrade, we could...

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:06.093
No, um, I don't want
to do an upgrade.

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:09.196
Uh...

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.999
Is there anything else
that you could use?

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:27.094
They're not home.

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.130
Oh.

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.966
Are you the granddaughter?

01:19:33.935 --> 01:19:36.036
Yeah, I'm Ellie.

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:38.372
But how do you know about me?

01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:40.474
You're all they could
talk about these
past few days.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:42.243
They're at the
department store.
Didn't Judy tell you?

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:44.044
Tell me what?

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.546
She's modeling today.

01:19:55.957 --> 01:19:57.491
No, uh-uh.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:00.828
I do not do yellow.
And it's in my contract.

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.997
What contract?
No one's getting paid.

01:20:02.999 --> 01:20:04.832
I do not do yellow

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:06.467
and I don't do purple.

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:09.904
They're just not my colors.
They never have been, I...

01:20:09.906 --> 01:20:12.740
Just look at my hair.
Are you crazy?

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:14.608
But, but this is all
that we have left.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.744
Well, then you've got a problem.

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.247
Judy.

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.016
Ellie!

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:28.489
Bruce said that you'd gone
and without saying goodbye.

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:30.858
I told him he was wrong.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.527
He said that you got that
in your blood
from your father,

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:36.463
and I said, "Well,
she also got some of my blood

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:39.033
"and my blood
is just not that rude."

01:20:39.035 --> 01:20:40.668
How are you, dear?

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:42.770
What is all this?

01:20:42.772 --> 01:20:45.706
Oh, it's not the best timing.

01:20:45.708 --> 01:20:49.009
But, but it was planned
months ago.

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:53.514
And well, I was just hoping
that it would take my mind
off my troubles.

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:57.284
How often do you get asked
to be a model at my age?

01:20:58.721 --> 01:21:02.122
Now, you go find Bruce
and you get a good seat,

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:03.858
and we'll go to the diner after.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.727
Okay!

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:09.730
<i>Here we see
the California casual.</i>

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:12.800
<i>Delightful and comfortable.</i>

01:21:12.802 --> 01:21:15.202
<i>- With this,
you can run your errands...</i>

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:17.805
<i>and still
look like a lady on the go.</i>

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:22.176
<i>Here we see the elegant gray,</i>

01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:24.712
<i>which is not
just for winter anymore.</i>

01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:26.747
<i>- Beautifully cut...</i>

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.549
<i>totally comfortable,</i>

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.718
<i>she looks so lovely.</i>

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.990
<i>Our next model
comes to the stage</i>

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:38.993
<i>bringing a little flash
and glitter.</i>

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:42.529
<i>And here we see midnight blue,</i>

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:45.232
<i>- suitable for any
formal occasion...</i>

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:48.002
<i>while allowing for comfort
at the same time.</i>

01:21:48.004 --> 01:21:50.738
<i>A beautiful
two-piece ensemble,</i>

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.274
<i>in beautiful midnight blue,</i>

01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:56.477
<i>- with sparkle and bling
to match her beauty.</i>

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.896
She's gonna be okay.

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:18.365
Boy, I wish I knew a prayer
right about now.

01:22:20.635 --> 01:22:22.269
Do you know any?

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.672
No, I'm afraid I don't.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:30.377
But don't Judy and you
go to church?

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.547
I just go for the singing

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:37.451
and she goes
to see all of her friends.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.820
I sleep through
a lot of the praying part.

01:22:41.389 --> 01:22:43.290
- You can go in now.
- Oh, thank you.

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:47.528
You go ahead.

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:54.068
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:56.170
My mom told me that Judy
got into an accident.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:59.173
Yeah, she had
a pretty bad fall
at the department store,

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:01.308
but I think that
she's gonna be okay.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:06.880
I'm glad you're still here.

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:11.318
Can't seem to stay away
from this place.

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:26.834
Uh...

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.370
You're leaving?

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:33.273
Yeah. It, um, it's not that...

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:35.275
I understand.

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:37.011
It's not that I don't want to.

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:41.448
Thanks.

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.952
And Tommy's gonna miss you.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.723
He's wonderful.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:56.130
Yeah, I don't know
what I would do without him.

01:23:58.299 --> 01:23:59.967
What about you?

01:23:59.969 --> 01:24:01.802
What's waiting for you
back in LA?

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:07.541
I broke up with my boyfriend.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:10.544
I'm gonna throw out
the annoying roommate
that I have

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:14.615
and probably
apply for that job
that I've been dreaming about.

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:18.652
Sounds like you'll be busy.

01:24:25.528 --> 01:24:27.394
Well, come on in, sweetheart.

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:33.667
From the height you fell from,
I'm gonna
count ourselves lucky.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:35.629
I thought you said
we wouldn't be
seeing you again.

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.573
You should leave, dear.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:40.874
Do you want to sleep?

01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:43.844
No, you should go back
to your home.

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:47.347
-Well...
-No, don't overstay
your visit.

01:24:47.349 --> 01:24:50.884
If you do that, then you won't
want to come back.

01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:55.022
And I want you to come back
with your brother
and with my great grandkids.

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:56.723
Why, I've never even seen them.

01:24:56.725 --> 01:24:58.525
But you have a broken knee.

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:00.727
Well, there are doctors here.

01:25:00.729 --> 01:25:04.298
Besides, it'll give Bruce
something to do.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.467
You need to get home

01:25:06.469 --> 01:25:09.470
and find someone
who'll make that furniture
that you design.

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:13.640
Now, give me a hug
and you get out of here.

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:38.765
- HEY.
- Hey.

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.071
Where would I stay?

01:25:44.073 --> 01:25:45.973
What do you mean?

01:25:45.975 --> 01:25:48.342
In Los Angeles,
if I came with you,
where would I stay?

01:25:48.344 --> 01:25:52.012
You'd live with me.

01:25:52.014 --> 01:25:55.415
You'd have to help me
throw out my roommate
but she scares pretty easy.

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:58.852
Okay.

01:25:58.854 --> 01:26:01.722
But then, just one thing is,
I'm not gonna get on a plane.

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.758
What? You want us to walk?

01:26:06.095 --> 01:26:07.494
What's wrong with this thing?
