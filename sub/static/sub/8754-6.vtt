WEBVTT

00:11.291 --> 00:12.924
They're just messing with her...

00:12.926 --> 00:15.014
touching her and manhandling her.

00:15.114 --> 00:17.848
I've seen... we call it the shadow man.

00:17.850 --> 00:21.752
He definitely pushes the living away.

00:21.754 --> 00:25.823
I've got a bone-chilling fear
for the safety of our kids.

00:25.825 --> 00:30.361
This room is bad, bad.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.630
I feel like there's evil in here.

00:33.632 --> 00:37.351
Why the is he torturing this girl?

00:38.571 --> 00:41.105
Something bad's going to happen.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.741
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.743 --> 00:45.042
There's panic.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.477
And it's almost like a butchering.

00:46.479 --> 00:47.544
I see dead people.

00:47.546 --> 00:49.680
They all died horribly.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.382
I speak to dead people.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.783
Get out of here.

00:52.785 --> 00:54.418
And they speak to me.

00:54.420 --> 00:56.453
Vicious.

00:56.455 --> 00:59.590
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.291
It doesn't matter where you are.
I'll find you.

01:01.293 --> 01:02.860
I rely on my partner.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.495
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:04.497 --> 01:06.397
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.098
This guy's a real piece of work.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.769
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.270
I feel like I live in a house of Hell.

01:13.272 --> 01:14.438
It's my job to reveal them.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.707
This is not good.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.442
But Steve and I never speak...

01:18.444 --> 01:20.477
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:20.479 --> 01:22.246
Until the very end...

01:22.248 --> 01:23.714
I want my life back.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.916
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:25.918 --> 01:27.718
Is he trying to kill her?

01:27.720 --> 01:28.986
Or time to get out.

01:28.988 --> 01:30.487
Oh, my God.

01:30.489 --> 01:32.189
This is going to kill us.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:46.141 --> 01:48.541
I'm down here in Macon, Georgia.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.177
Amy and I got called in
by a guy named Jeff.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.846
He says his entire
family's being terrorized

01:52.848 --> 01:54.697
by activity in the house,

01:54.699 --> 01:56.950
but he's most concerned
about his youngest daughter,

01:56.952 --> 01:59.652
who's being physically attacked
and can barely sleep at night.

01:59.654 --> 02:02.422
Now, he's a man of faith,
and he tried prayer,

02:02.424 --> 02:04.557
but it seems to be getting worse.

02:04.559 --> 02:07.594
He told me we were his last hope.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.766
Before Amy arrives,

02:13.768 --> 02:16.536
I look for anything that
can influence her findings.

02:16.538 --> 02:18.338
Family photos and other personal items

02:18.340 --> 02:20.874
need to be covered or removed.

02:20.876 --> 02:22.242
When I'm finished,

02:22.244 --> 02:24.644
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:36.224 --> 02:39.792
Coming up, my body wanted to run...

02:39.794 --> 02:45.081
like an instinct, you know,
when you're being hunted.

02:45.083 --> 02:50.870
I definitely get that
there's a lot of chaos

02:50.872 --> 02:53.306
going on around here.

02:56.011 --> 02:58.945
It's extremely distracting.

02:58.947 --> 03:04.884
I feel extremely ill...
really bad... and very painful.

03:04.886 --> 03:06.653
It's bad.

03:13.228 --> 03:14.560
When we spoke on the phone,

03:14.562 --> 03:16.195
it sounded like you were at your wits' end.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.165
Last couple of years,
it's been hell to live here.

03:19.167 --> 03:20.900
What are you and your family going through?

03:20.902 --> 03:23.069
We're talking about anywhere

03:23.071 --> 03:25.738
from footsteps to shadow figures...

03:25.740 --> 03:26.873
Okay.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.409
To hitting, scratching.

03:29.411 --> 03:31.277
Who all lives in the house?

03:31.279 --> 03:36.683
It's myself, my wife,
Tami, Jessica, my child,

03:36.685 --> 03:39.085
and my son, Hunter.

03:39.087 --> 03:40.253
You mentioned that you
were really concerned

03:40.255 --> 03:41.254
about your youngest daughter.

03:41.256 --> 03:42.472
Correct.

03:42.474 --> 03:45.091
We've just always been
real protective of her,

03:45.093 --> 03:48.861
and she seems to be the one
that mostly gets attacked.

03:48.863 --> 03:52.966
And, of course,
she's coming downstairs to us, crying.

03:52.968 --> 03:56.369
There's no way for me to protect her.

03:56.371 --> 03:59.822
All you can do is hold her and
tell her it'll be all right,

03:59.824 --> 04:01.307
although you don't know.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.709
That would drive me crazy.

04:02.711 --> 04:03.876
It hurts.

04:03.878 --> 04:04.877
The house looks pretty new.

04:04.879 --> 04:05.945
How long have you guys been here?

04:05.947 --> 04:07.830
We've been here 23 years... '91.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.082
We built the house.

04:09.084 --> 04:11.584
Did you guys have experiences
from the beginning?

04:11.586 --> 04:12.986
Just mischievous stuff...

04:12.988 --> 04:16.555
nothing alarming, nothing frightening.

04:16.558 --> 04:17.824
Okay, so why are you calling us now?

04:17.826 --> 04:22.128
About a year and a half ago,
it started getting ugly.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.013
Have you guys tried anything

04:24.015 --> 04:26.399
to try to stop what's happening here?

04:26.401 --> 04:30.136
A lot of prayer, a lot of shared prayer.

04:30.138 --> 04:31.671
Nothing's helped.

04:31.673 --> 04:35.758
I can't physically protect my family.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.310
I need help.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.816
So, there's this older man here.

04:43.818 --> 04:46.019
He's talking about two bedrooms...

04:46.021 --> 04:48.388
two bedrooms that are important here.

04:48.390 --> 04:52.141
There's a male and a
female in these two rooms

04:52.143 --> 04:54.477
that are having the problems.

04:57.565 --> 05:01.067
But then there's this other guy who's,
like, younger.

05:01.069 --> 05:06.773
The younger guy is accusing
him of being abusive.

05:11.112 --> 05:13.446
There's a relationship there.

05:13.448 --> 05:17.383
I'm thinking father/son
or grandfather/grandson.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.619
There's a lot of anger and tension here,

05:19.621 --> 05:21.687
and it's a lot between these two men.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.890
It's completely unhealthy.

05:23.892 --> 05:25.858
It's very, very stressful.

05:25.860 --> 05:27.527
You know, you can really feel it.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.434
So, why'd you bring me
into the living room?

05:34.436 --> 05:37.770
This is where most of my
stuff has taken place.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.238
Like what?

05:39.240 --> 05:41.924
Me and my son came in the other afternoon.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.544
We were walking through the living room.

05:44.546 --> 05:47.964
The fireplace pokers started doing this,

05:47.966 --> 05:49.582
shaking all about.

05:49.584 --> 05:50.750
Did it stop?

05:50.752 --> 05:51.851
It stopped.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.820
We came back, walked back and forth,

05:53.822 --> 05:55.621
jumped all around in the room.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.824
It doesn't move.

05:57.826 --> 05:58.991
So we didn't do that.

05:58.993 --> 06:00.827
You guys didn't have a
violent storm or anything,

06:00.829 --> 06:02.662
with hard thunder, or anything like that?

06:02.664 --> 06:04.030
No, no.

06:04.032 --> 06:05.998
Anything else like that ever happen?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.334
- We came in from church one Sunday...
- Okay.

06:08.336 --> 06:11.003
The whole family together.

06:11.005 --> 06:13.072
This sofa's pulled out from the wall.

06:13.074 --> 06:16.509
The other sofa behind me is
pulled out from the wall.

06:16.511 --> 06:20.246
The recliner is turned around,
facing the window.

06:20.248 --> 06:22.081
And you definitely weren't broken into,

06:22.083 --> 06:23.282
and nothing was breached?

06:23.284 --> 06:24.700
Nothing moved.

06:24.702 --> 06:27.787
Nothing but those three items were moved.

06:27.789 --> 06:29.055
Hm.

06:29.057 --> 06:34.327
As far as in here,
I'm seeing movement issues.

06:34.329 --> 06:37.630
I am seeing leaving a room, and it's...

06:37.632 --> 06:39.065
something's set up...

06:39.067 --> 06:41.367
say the balls are set up
a certain way coming back

06:41.369 --> 06:43.753
and everything's...

06:43.755 --> 06:45.271
scattered.

06:46.941 --> 06:49.909
But I don't know who
the [bleep] is doing it.

06:49.911 --> 06:51.210
Nobody's copping to it.

06:57.952 --> 07:00.036
So, Tami,
I was talking to your husband, Jeff,

07:00.038 --> 07:01.954
about stuff that's going on in the house.

07:01.956 --> 07:03.756
Curious how you're handling things.

07:03.758 --> 07:05.625
You know, it's just day to day.

07:05.627 --> 07:10.730
I've got just a bone-chilling fear

07:10.732 --> 07:13.065
for the safety of our kids at this point.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.117
And, Tami, when I talked to Jeff,

07:15.119 --> 07:17.570
he seemed to think that whatever's here's

07:17.572 --> 07:18.905
kind of picking on Jessica.

07:18.907 --> 07:19.956
Is that accurate?

07:19.958 --> 07:21.908
Oh, I would definitely agree with that.

07:21.910 --> 07:23.993
There's a lot more activity with Jessica

07:23.995 --> 07:25.378
that's a lot more physical.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.779
That's got to kill you, as a mom.

07:26.781 --> 07:28.981
It breaks my heart.

07:28.983 --> 07:30.700
You're constantly scared.

07:30.702 --> 07:34.554
You don't know what's gonna
happen next to your children.

07:34.556 --> 07:37.190
Now, what about yourself?
What about your experiences?

07:37.192 --> 07:38.357
Have you had any?

07:38.359 --> 07:41.060
I was sleeping on my
side of the bed one night

07:41.062 --> 07:44.564
and felt someone sit on
the side of the bed,

07:44.566 --> 07:47.283
and it was, like, someone heavy.

07:47.285 --> 07:50.770
I mean, you could feel the mattress go down

07:50.772 --> 07:53.623
to the point that it
pulled the covers tight

07:53.625 --> 07:55.408
on the bottom part of my leg.

07:55.410 --> 07:56.776
And you're sure it wasn't a dream?

07:56.778 --> 07:58.744
Positive it wasn't a dream.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.646
- Anything else?
- Yes.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.583
There is a presence in
this corner periodically.

08:03.585 --> 08:06.419
It's always in the corner,
by the gun cabinet.

08:06.421 --> 08:09.455
And you immediately know
you're being watched.

08:09.457 --> 08:11.224
What do you think this is?

08:11.226 --> 08:13.226
I have no idea, Steve.

08:13.228 --> 08:17.430
All I know is it's dangerous,
it's threatening,

08:17.432 --> 08:20.600
and it seems to be getting worse.

08:22.203 --> 08:30.376
This older man is definitely
causing people to be afraid.

08:30.378 --> 08:31.978
If they irritate him at all,

08:31.980 --> 08:34.746
he does creepy [bleep] to
kind of freak them out.

08:34.749 --> 08:37.082
What does he do to them?

08:37.085 --> 08:39.501
He'll come at night

08:39.504 --> 08:44.457
and, like, move around like a
big spider on the floor...

08:44.459 --> 08:45.825
on all fours.

08:48.796 --> 08:52.965
But they're seeing, like,
this dark thing, you know,

08:52.967 --> 08:56.102
moving around the floor and the room,

08:56.104 --> 09:00.206
going under the bed,
and this freaks people out.

09:00.208 --> 09:03.042
Or stand in the corner and watch people.

09:04.746 --> 09:07.680
It is creepy, and people do see,

09:07.682 --> 09:10.099
like, this black thing in the corner.

09:10.101 --> 09:11.984
Do you know what this old
man wants with the living?

09:13.137 --> 09:16.489
He wants to control them

09:16.491 --> 09:18.991
like he controlled the
people when he was alive.

09:40.626 --> 09:42.360
So, Hunter,
I was talking to your parents,

09:42.362 --> 09:43.427
and they were telling me

09:43.429 --> 09:44.662
you're having a pretty tough time here.

09:44.664 --> 09:46.364
Yeah.

09:46.366 --> 09:48.666
I feel very unwanted in the house.

09:48.668 --> 09:50.201
Okay. What are you going through?

09:51.971 --> 09:53.771
I see... we call it the shadow man.

09:53.773 --> 09:57.041
I've seen it, you know,
20-plus times, easy.

09:57.043 --> 09:58.943
And it's most of the time

09:58.945 --> 10:01.579
right in between those windows right there.

10:01.581 --> 10:03.280
Is it possible that it's a shadow

10:03.282 --> 10:04.849
reflected from outside at all?

10:04.851 --> 10:07.485
I keep my blinds down.
They're blackout blinds.

10:07.487 --> 10:09.036
You can't see through them.

10:09.038 --> 10:10.271
Really?

10:10.273 --> 10:12.289
I know your sister's
going through some stuff.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.324
You and her discuss this.

10:13.326 --> 10:15.710
I try to keep it to myself, honestly.

10:15.712 --> 10:17.261
She's already on edge.

10:17.263 --> 10:21.832
You know, I've had probably
up to 10 calls from her...

10:21.834 --> 10:23.000
"Hey, are you in the house?"

10:23.002 --> 10:24.268
"No, I'm not even at the house."

10:24.270 --> 10:26.003
She said, "I'm the only one home.

10:26.005 --> 10:27.638
There's somebody in the house."

10:27.640 --> 10:32.126
It's definitely attracted to her,
for some reason,

10:32.128 --> 10:34.345
and I don't know why.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.817
I think the two bedrooms
the old man was talking about...

10:39.819 --> 10:41.786
they're upstairs.

10:43.523 --> 10:46.273
Mmm, there's a male here,

10:46.275 --> 10:50.161
and there's some kind of
bonding between this person

10:50.163 --> 10:51.796
and the female in the other room.

10:53.699 --> 10:55.750
There's something about the windows.

10:55.752 --> 10:58.636
Uh... I didn't like the windows.

11:02.108 --> 11:03.707
The female...

11:06.712 --> 11:11.715
This room is, like, bad, bad.

11:23.446 --> 11:24.528
So, Jessica,
I was talking to Mom, Dad,

11:24.530 --> 11:25.863
and your brother, Hunter,

11:25.865 --> 11:29.967
and it seems like whatever's
here is kind of targeting you.

11:29.969 --> 11:31.168
Mm-hmm.

11:31.170 --> 11:34.605
Okay, what are some of the
things that are happening?

11:34.607 --> 11:37.575
Well, a lot of times,
my drawers open by themselves.

11:37.577 --> 11:40.111
They just open, all of them.

11:42.548 --> 11:43.798
They're almost to the point

11:43.800 --> 11:45.766
where they're falling out of the dresser.

11:45.768 --> 11:46.917
- That far out?
- Yes.

11:46.919 --> 11:49.086
Is there anything else
moving around in the room.

11:49.088 --> 11:50.988
Well, I've actually seen

11:50.990 --> 11:53.757
what I thought was a man in my room.

11:53.759 --> 11:56.060
It was in front of my bed,

11:56.062 --> 11:58.729
and it was actually going
through my paperwork

11:58.731 --> 11:59.964
on my table.

11:59.966 --> 12:03.968
I heard the paper shuffling,
so that's why I woke up.

12:03.970 --> 12:06.337
I called out to him, and he didn't answer,

12:06.339 --> 12:08.139
so I turned to turn on the light,

12:08.141 --> 12:10.374
and I came back, and the papers were moved.

12:10.376 --> 12:13.744
They were open,
when originally they were closed.

12:13.746 --> 12:15.379
Okay.

12:15.381 --> 12:16.847
How are you sleeping at night?

12:16.849 --> 12:20.951
I do have nightmares all the time,
and I sleepwalk.

12:20.953 --> 12:23.420
Give me an example of what you're dreaming.

12:23.422 --> 12:24.722
I'd be outside.

12:24.724 --> 12:26.223
The sky was red,

12:26.225 --> 12:29.527
and everything had almost a red tint.

12:29.529 --> 12:31.128
Okay.

12:31.130 --> 12:33.981
People would be dancing.

12:33.983 --> 12:38.002
And then everyone would stop
and just turn their head

12:38.004 --> 12:39.403
like they were looking at something.

12:40.806 --> 12:42.039
But then I'd wake up,

12:42.041 --> 12:44.041
so I never saw what they were looking at.

12:44.043 --> 12:46.477
Okay.

12:48.681 --> 12:52.383
This female... she has horrible nightmares,

12:52.385 --> 12:54.852
horrible [bleep] nightmares...

12:54.854 --> 12:57.905
some she remembers, some she doesn't.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.191
Like,
I see her waking up outside the house like,

13:00.193 --> 13:01.892
"What the [bleep] What the [bleep]"

13:01.894 --> 13:05.646
But I don't know if
these are just nightmares

13:05.648 --> 13:07.264
that she's having.

13:07.266 --> 13:11.602
When she's having these experiences,

13:11.604 --> 13:15.773
I think there's another force here,

13:15.775 --> 13:20.844
and it's causing a lot
of physical phenomena.

13:23.266 --> 13:24.348
What the [bleep]

13:24.350 --> 13:26.400
What's going on?

13:26.402 --> 13:29.236
She does see the older man. He watches.

13:29.238 --> 13:32.106
He calls himself "The Watcher"
when all the [bleep] going on.

13:33.993 --> 13:35.759
Why the [bleep] is he torturing this girl?

13:39.715 --> 13:40.714
They'll touch me.

13:40.716 --> 13:42.349
I've been doing my hair before,

13:42.351 --> 13:46.303
and it just grabbed it right
here and just snatched it.

13:46.305 --> 13:51.173
And they were big fingers,
so I felt like it was more of a man.

13:51.174 --> 13:52.123
Wow.

13:52.556 --> 13:54.236
From that point, it only got worse.

13:54.614 --> 13:58.682
At one point,
something actually laid down behind me.

13:58.684 --> 14:01.652
It almost felt like it was spooning.

14:01.654 --> 14:04.154
It had its head, like, on me.

14:04.156 --> 14:05.656
I mean, I was terrified.

14:05.658 --> 14:06.724
I couldn't move.

14:06.726 --> 14:07.891
I couldn't speak.

14:07.893 --> 14:09.226
I couldn't even cry.

14:09.228 --> 14:11.929
And then it finally just got up,
and I heard it walk out.

14:11.931 --> 14:15.933
And at that point, I just started crying.

14:15.935 --> 14:17.768
Like, I bawled my eyes out.

14:17.770 --> 14:19.737
Okay.

14:19.739 --> 14:22.072
And I've woken up with scratches.

14:22.074 --> 14:23.324
Okay.

14:23.326 --> 14:25.109
You guys have a cat, right?

14:25.111 --> 14:26.243
Oh, my cat's declawed.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.747
How often is that happening...
the scratches?

14:29.749 --> 14:32.216
The scratches only
happened like three times.

14:32.218 --> 14:33.350
<i>Only</i> three times?

14:33.352 --> 14:34.668
You hear what you're saying?

14:34.670 --> 14:36.136
I have a daughter 23 years old.

14:36.138 --> 14:38.439
I couldn't imagine her coming to me

14:38.441 --> 14:40.758
and telling me the stuff you're saying.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.127
That would kill me.

14:43.129 --> 14:46.864
I feel like there's evil in here.

14:46.866 --> 14:49.233
I want it to leave.

14:49.235 --> 14:51.268
I want our lives back.

14:52.722 --> 14:53.971
Okay.

14:55.775 --> 15:01.979
There's these little,
dark things, like children.

15:01.981 --> 15:04.281
They're black.

15:04.283 --> 15:10.554
They're around the bed
and touching her feet.

15:10.556 --> 15:12.056
They're climbing on the bed.

15:12.058 --> 15:13.857
They're climbing on her.

15:13.859 --> 15:16.727
They're incapacitating
her so she can't move.

15:16.729 --> 15:19.096
She can't yell. She can't do anything.

15:19.098 --> 15:22.800
She's like...

15:22.802 --> 15:26.070
Like, the air gets sucked out.

15:26.072 --> 15:29.106
I feel uncomfortable.

15:30.643 --> 15:33.310
I'm getting chills. Okay, I'm freaking out.

15:47.824 --> 15:50.324
When I get to a new town,
I put my feelers out

15:50.326 --> 15:52.493
to cops, historians, local professors.

15:52.495 --> 15:54.161
In this case, it paid off.

15:55.061 --> 15:57.896
I'm on my way to meet
with a local genealogist

15:57.898 --> 16:00.698
who says all the early owners
of Jeff and Tami's property

16:00.700 --> 16:01.866
were slave owners.

16:01.868 --> 16:03.968
Now,
I don't know if it's gonna help my case,

16:03.970 --> 16:06.471
but it's something I
definitely want to check out.

16:13.914 --> 16:15.557
So, Cecil, you mentioned on the phone

16:15.657 --> 16:17.107
that some of the early owners

16:17.109 --> 16:19.509
of the property I'm
investigating had slaves.

16:19.511 --> 16:20.594
That's correct.

16:20.596 --> 16:21.845
Okay, what can you tell me about them?

16:21.847 --> 16:23.980
Well, the earliest guy
that we have recorded

16:23.982 --> 16:25.048
was named John Martin.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.601
He shows up in 1830 census.

16:27.603 --> 16:30.887
And it shows that he owned 33 slaves.

16:30.889 --> 16:31.888
33?

16:31.890 --> 16:33.023
33.

16:33.025 --> 16:36.610
He was a slave trader
for the area of Macon,

16:36.612 --> 16:38.495
as well as he was a farmer.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.263
I guess that would explain why so many.

16:40.298 --> 16:41.413
Yes.

16:41.415 --> 16:43.061
Okay, so, now,
how long does he have the property?

16:43.161 --> 16:45.847
Well,
we have record that he sold the property

16:45.947 --> 16:49.048
in 1837 to a guy named Alexander Hunt.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.383
Okay, so now he moves there.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.517
Is he a slave owner, too?

16:51.519 --> 16:54.587
The 1850 census right here shows

16:54.589 --> 16:57.523
that Alexander has 38 slaves,

16:57.525 --> 16:59.692
so he has a few more than John Martin did.

16:59.694 --> 17:02.295
Wow. All right, so...

17:02.297 --> 17:04.597
for some reason,
this property has an abundance of slaves.

17:04.598 --> 17:06.332
Right.

17:13.675 --> 17:15.842
Okay, there's another man down here.

17:15.844 --> 17:18.711
He's got issues.

17:20.181 --> 17:23.750
He is very angry.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.652
Probably like six foot.

17:25.654 --> 17:26.986
He's a big guy,

17:26.988 --> 17:30.523
big, round dude... like, chubby and built.

17:30.525 --> 17:37.764
He's, like, sweating,
and he's really angry, and hot.

17:41.336 --> 17:43.336
He's very protective of his space.

17:43.338 --> 17:46.005
He doesn't really want
anybody else down here.

17:46.007 --> 17:49.709
So he definitely pushes the living away.

17:49.711 --> 17:53.546
People would feel him like a wall, like,

17:53.548 --> 17:56.516
coming up behind them, like,
just kind of pushing them out.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.056
The property's then sold to Joshua Harris.

18:03.058 --> 18:05.591
Okay, now, what about him,
as far as slaves go?

18:05.593 --> 18:07.293
According to the records,
he only has six slaves.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.329
Okay, so how's it go for Joshua?

18:09.331 --> 18:11.047
Everything seems to be going pretty well

18:11.049 --> 18:12.165
until the Civil War comes,

18:12.167 --> 18:14.267
and in 1862,

18:14.269 --> 18:16.002
one of his sons joins the Confederate Army.

18:16.004 --> 18:17.070
His name's James.

18:17.072 --> 18:18.171
Okay.

18:18.173 --> 18:19.922
Do we have any idea how old that kid was?

18:19.924 --> 18:21.074
James was 20.

18:21.076 --> 18:22.442
After he was in,

18:22.444 --> 18:23.910
just north of Atlanta, he was captured,

18:23.912 --> 18:25.144
and he was held prisoner of war.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.997
Joshua Harris had another son

18:27.999 --> 18:29.949
that was just a year younger,
named Franklin.

18:29.951 --> 18:31.150
Franklin, I would assume,

18:31.152 --> 18:32.719
did the same thing as his brother.

18:32.721 --> 18:34.120
No, Franklin did not join.

18:34.122 --> 18:35.855
Why not?

18:35.857 --> 18:37.740
I get the impression that
his dad encouraged him

18:37.742 --> 18:38.858
and wanted him to,

18:38.860 --> 18:40.193
but you know how sometimes children are...

18:40.195 --> 18:41.577
no matter what you ask them to do,

18:41.579 --> 18:42.695
they do just the opposite.

18:42.697 --> 18:45.031
There's always a rebellious
one in the crowd.

18:45.033 --> 18:46.632
So, now, the war ends.

18:46.634 --> 18:48.534
What happens with Joshua and the farm?

18:48.536 --> 18:50.536
Well,
Joshua was able to hold onto the property,

18:50.538 --> 18:52.271
whereas many landowners were not able to.

18:52.273 --> 18:54.774
Okay, so does he stay there,
or does he move on?

18:54.776 --> 18:58.611
He stays there until he dies
in 1895 at the age of 85.

18:58.613 --> 19:00.980
Okay, what happened to his son James?

19:00.982 --> 19:03.349
James is released as a prisoner of war

19:03.351 --> 19:04.984
when the war's over, and he comes back.

19:04.986 --> 19:08.588
What about the son, Franklin,
that never went off to war?

19:08.590 --> 19:11.724
Well, sometime after 1895,
after his dad's death,

19:11.726 --> 19:14.477
Franklin and two of the sisters leave,

19:14.479 --> 19:17.613
and we find record of
them in 1899 in Texas.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.867
Okay,
so did Franklin inherit any of the land?

19:20.869 --> 19:23.736
Either he wasn't left any,
or maybe he sold his part.

19:23.738 --> 19:25.304
Okay.

19:27.308 --> 19:32.378
I'm seeing the older and younger man again.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.781
And they're fighting.

19:34.783 --> 19:37.016
It's uncomfortable.

19:37.018 --> 19:38.951
That younger guy was saying

19:38.953 --> 19:44.390
that this older man was abusive,
physically abusive...

19:44.392 --> 19:47.193
you know,
that he was [bleep] torturing the family.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.432
He ruled with an iron fist.

19:52.434 --> 19:58.337
And I heard words, which was,
"father," "landowner," "slave."

19:58.339 --> 20:02.742
The younger man doesn't
have anything in common

20:02.744 --> 20:04.710
with this older man.

20:04.712 --> 20:05.912
He doesn't like him.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.647
There's a lot of anger
and resentment there.

20:07.649 --> 20:12.018
The older man's perspective
to the younger man,

20:12.020 --> 20:16.722
there's a sense of disappointment.

20:16.724 --> 20:20.026
And do you know if they have any kind

20:20.028 --> 20:22.895
of connection to this property?

20:22.897 --> 20:24.330
Definitely the land.

20:26.151 --> 20:28.985
The younger man just kept
talking about the land.

20:28.987 --> 20:34.040
He was talking about a massacre,
something about a war.

20:34.042 --> 20:38.377
He said that there were
a lot of innocent people.

20:38.379 --> 20:41.647
He also said something about murders.

20:41.649 --> 20:44.250
He said the dead weren't respected here.

20:57.786 --> 20:59.886
So far,
I've got a family being terrorized

20:59.888 --> 21:01.187
by unexplained activity

21:01.189 --> 21:03.769
and a property that was
home to dozens of slaves.

21:05.054 --> 21:07.255
But I need to see if there's anything else

21:07.257 --> 21:08.456
that will help my case.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.928
Searching through old records,
I find a battle

21:12.930 --> 21:15.380
that broke out between Union
and Confederate soldiers

21:15.382 --> 21:17.065
right on my client's property.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.771
Obviously,
I need to know more about this fight,

21:22.773 --> 21:25.073
so I reached out to a
local Civil War expert

21:25.075 --> 21:26.608
who says it was a bloody battle

21:26.610 --> 21:29.177
and the information will
definitely help my case.

21:36.053 --> 21:38.004
So, Michael,
why'd you want to meet here?

21:38.104 --> 21:41.264
Joshua Harris,
who owned your client's property

21:41.364 --> 21:42.830
during the American Civil War...

21:42.832 --> 21:44.232
- Yeah?
- is buried right here.

21:46.303 --> 21:49.203
And how close is this spot
to my client's property?

21:49.205 --> 21:51.573
Probably 800, 900 yards.

21:51.575 --> 21:52.740
Okay.

21:52.742 --> 21:54.292
Now, you mentioned on the phone

21:54.294 --> 21:55.810
that there was a bloody battle

21:55.812 --> 21:57.545
that took place right on the property.

21:57.547 --> 21:58.746
- Yes.
- What happened?

21:58.748 --> 22:01.749
Steve,
I'm sure you've heard of Sherman's March.

22:01.751 --> 22:03.217
I have.

22:03.219 --> 22:06.721
Troops moving from Atlanta to Savannah,

22:06.723 --> 22:10.458
wreaking havoc along the way...
tearing up rail road tracks,

22:10.460 --> 22:13.912
stealing crops, livestock, burning barns,

22:13.914 --> 22:15.997
things of military value.

22:15.999 --> 22:19.417
And this is a period
etching that an artist did

22:19.419 --> 22:22.136
depicting some of that destruction.

22:22.138 --> 22:26.291
The Confederates knew that
Sherman was approaching,

22:26.293 --> 22:28.593
so they sent various units out

22:28.595 --> 22:31.045
to establish defensive positions,

22:31.047 --> 22:32.714
one of them right here.

22:32.716 --> 22:35.216
Okay, so what happened?

22:35.218 --> 22:37.619
On November 20, 1864,

22:37.621 --> 22:41.422
Sherman's cavalry came right
down this road out here.

22:41.424 --> 22:44.492
The Confederate troops were lying in wait

22:44.494 --> 22:46.961
in the heavily wooded area
on each side of the road

22:46.963 --> 22:48.262
on your client's property.

22:48.264 --> 22:49.397
Okay.

22:49.399 --> 22:52.767
And as the first soldiers got close enough,

22:52.769 --> 22:54.602
the Confederates charged.

22:54.604 --> 22:55.937
Okay,
so they got attacked and ambushed here.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.138
Yes.

22:57.140 --> 23:00.742
And when the smoke of
battle began to dissipate,

23:00.744 --> 23:03.478
seven Confederates lay dead.

23:04.914 --> 23:07.382
What about the Union side...
any casualties?

23:07.384 --> 23:09.834
The records do not tell
us that information,

23:09.836 --> 23:11.619
but it is certainly possible,

23:11.621 --> 23:16.557
and if we did have dead
Federal soldiers here,

23:16.559 --> 23:19.360
most likely, the Confederates would have

23:19.362 --> 23:21.863
interred them in a mass grave.

23:21.865 --> 23:26.467
Steve, I think the real kicker,
for Harris in particular...

23:26.469 --> 23:29.470
earlier in 1864, Georgia's governor

23:29.472 --> 23:32.740
had ordered a census statewide.

23:32.742 --> 23:36.077
He wanted to capture the
names and locations

23:36.079 --> 23:39.580
of all male citizens
eligible to be called up

23:39.582 --> 23:42.166
into the service of the militia.

23:42.168 --> 23:43.418
Okay.

23:43.420 --> 23:47.021
Guess whose name appears on that list.

23:47.023 --> 23:48.756
Our guy, Joshua Harris.

23:48.758 --> 23:50.391
Wow.

23:50.393 --> 23:53.761
So I think there is a very good possibility

23:53.763 --> 23:55.680
he was fighting on his own property.

23:57.834 --> 24:01.369
I am seeing a lot of activity.

24:01.371 --> 24:06.007
There's a lot of men in
both of these directions.

24:09.245 --> 24:11.412
That group is very large.

24:11.414 --> 24:14.482
That one's the big one.

24:14.484 --> 24:15.683
That's a lot of men.

24:15.685 --> 24:18.219
That's, like, you know, war.

24:19.923 --> 24:23.257
Like, I'm definitely feeling,
you know, panic and stress,

24:23.259 --> 24:25.093
and, you know, it's loud.

24:25.095 --> 24:30.615
And there's... that's very sneaky.

24:30.617 --> 24:32.316
It was very sneaky.

24:32.318 --> 24:33.701
It was planned.

24:33.703 --> 24:36.604
There was a lot of yelling between them.

24:36.606 --> 24:39.373
I think that they were being hunted,

24:39.375 --> 24:41.409
and that's why they're
freaking the [bleep] out

24:41.411 --> 24:42.877
and trying to hide [bleep]

24:42.879 --> 24:45.880
Then I'm getting the
[bleep] pain in my head

24:45.882 --> 24:47.482
like a son of a [bleep]

24:47.484 --> 24:49.901
It hurts a lot.

24:56.659 --> 24:59.777
I encountered several dead
people during my walk,

24:59.779 --> 25:02.630
but the dark things
surrounding a living girl's bed

25:02.632 --> 25:04.799
had me the most concerned.

25:04.801 --> 25:07.168
There was a thing.

25:07.170 --> 25:12.640
It was actually standing
to the side of her.

25:12.642 --> 25:17.211
Same body shape as the child.

25:17.213 --> 25:21.015
It had its hand over her mouth,

25:21.017 --> 25:24.102
and the way that the arm
and the hand looked

25:24.104 --> 25:26.387
was not normal.

25:28.625 --> 25:29.957
Is this what you saw?

25:31.077 --> 25:33.194
Yes, that's what I saw.

25:53.012 --> 25:55.796
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:55.798 --> 25:57.932
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

25:57.934 --> 26:00.668
and our clients for the first time.

26:00.970 --> 26:03.537
Amy, I'd like you to meet
two very worried parents,

26:03.539 --> 26:05.739
Jeff and Tami.

26:05.741 --> 26:08.275
Everybody in the house
is having experiences,

26:08.277 --> 26:11.278
including their son, Hunter,
who I have a picture of here.

26:12.315 --> 26:13.814
Okay.

26:13.816 --> 26:16.283
Now, the main reason we're here
is their daughter, Jessica.

26:16.285 --> 26:19.119
She's going through hell.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.654
And it's killing Jeff and Tami

26:20.656 --> 26:22.723
that they can't do nothing to help her.

26:22.725 --> 26:24.225
And we're their last hope.

26:25.095 --> 26:27.412
So now that Amy knows who you guys are,

26:27.414 --> 26:29.897
I'm gonna have her tell us about her walk.

26:33.575 --> 26:35.525
So, when I was outside,

26:35.527 --> 26:38.395
the first thing that I
saw was a lot of chaos.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.398
There was some kind of big battle.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.933
There was a lot of men.

26:42.935 --> 26:46.336
There was some general who was,
like, pacing around.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.506
Something about a massacre,

26:49.508 --> 26:55.779
and I could feel there's so
much stress in this area.

26:56.196 --> 26:57.862
I think I know
what you might have seen.

26:57.864 --> 27:00.315
I wasn't shocked to find
that there was gonna be

27:00.317 --> 27:03.818
Civil War activity in this area,

27:03.820 --> 27:05.887
but what I was shocked about
is that you had a battle

27:05.889 --> 27:08.373
that took place right on your property.

27:08.375 --> 27:11.209
Now, what happened is in 1864,

27:11.211 --> 27:14.112
General Sherman led the
Union Army on a march.

27:14.114 --> 27:15.646
It started it Atlanta,

27:15.648 --> 27:17.081
and he was going through the whole state.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.817
I got an artist's
depiction of what happened.

27:19.819 --> 27:22.253
They destroyed everything.

27:22.255 --> 27:24.555
Now, on November 20th of that year,

27:24.557 --> 27:27.725
the Union Army came right
across your property here,

27:27.727 --> 27:29.293
where they got ambushed.

27:29.295 --> 27:32.497
But it turned out worse
for the Confederate side,

27:32.499 --> 27:34.832
'cause they were badly outgunned.

27:34.834 --> 27:37.301
They wound up killing
seven Confederate soldiers

27:37.303 --> 27:38.770
right here on your land.

27:38.772 --> 27:39.871
Wow.

27:39.873 --> 27:42.006
Now, did you guys know about the battle?

27:42.008 --> 27:43.574
- No.
- No idea.

27:43.576 --> 27:46.010
We knew there was Civil
War activity around here,

27:46.012 --> 27:48.096
but we had no idea a battle took place.

27:52.586 --> 27:54.252
So, what else did you see?

27:54.254 --> 27:59.057
As soon as I walked in,
I saw this older male.

27:59.059 --> 28:02.527
He would show himself

28:02.529 --> 28:05.630
dressed in, like,
a black cloak and black hat.

28:05.632 --> 28:10.435
He was extremely tall, and he was angry.

28:10.437 --> 28:12.403
The other thing he made known

28:12.405 --> 28:15.340
was that he likes to make people feel fear.

28:15.342 --> 28:18.676
I was actually in the master bedroom,

28:18.678 --> 28:22.680
and he slid into the
corner and was watching,

28:22.682 --> 28:24.616
and that's part of his thing,

28:24.618 --> 28:28.453
is he likes to watch people a lot.

28:28.995 --> 28:32.730
I also got him, like,
squatting down like a spider

28:32.732 --> 28:37.768
and, like,
moving around the floor very quickly.

28:37.770 --> 28:40.905
There's a presence in my room,
in the corner,

28:40.907 --> 28:44.842
that I'll wake up and I know
immediately I'm being watched,

28:44.844 --> 28:47.511
and it's interesting that you said

28:47.513 --> 28:50.347
about him getting small
and towards the floor,

28:50.349 --> 28:53.334
because Jeff and I have
recently talked about how

28:53.336 --> 28:54.952
we'll go to get in the bed,

28:54.954 --> 28:56.253
and it's almost like you're a kid

28:56.255 --> 28:57.638
and you're afraid for your feet

28:57.640 --> 28:59.206
to get close to the edge of the bed.

28:59.208 --> 29:00.257
Mm-hmm.

29:00.259 --> 29:02.143
54 years old, I'm a grown man,

29:02.145 --> 29:05.963
and sometimes you feel like a
kid running to jump in the bed.

29:05.965 --> 29:07.131
Mm-hmm.

29:07.133 --> 29:08.232
I see the shadow person

29:08.234 --> 29:10.868
usually in the middle of the floor.

29:10.870 --> 29:13.103
It was looking through my papers,
like it was nosy.

29:13.105 --> 29:17.291
But Hunter sees him more than I do.

29:19.378 --> 29:22.046
Wow. Okay.

29:22.048 --> 29:23.514
When I look into my brother's eyes,

29:23.516 --> 29:25.749
I can tell he's scared.

29:25.751 --> 29:28.853
I'm supposed to be the
protector of my home,

29:28.855 --> 29:30.855
and there's nothing I can do.

29:35.962 --> 29:37.611
Any idea who this
guy might have been

29:37.613 --> 29:38.729
when he was living?

29:38.731 --> 29:44.335
Most of the information I got about him

29:44.337 --> 29:48.422
was actually through another person...
a younger man.

29:48.424 --> 29:52.376
The younger man has a lot
of anger and resentment

29:52.378 --> 29:55.446
towards this older man,
so I kind of got, like,

29:55.448 --> 29:57.081
there was some kind of
family connection here,

29:57.083 --> 30:01.585
whether this was father and son
or grandfather and grandson.

30:01.587 --> 30:05.589
The older man,
the only thing that came from him

30:05.591 --> 30:07.541
was his disappointment in the younger man,

30:07.543 --> 30:08.959
which the younger man
doesn't give a [bleep] about.

30:08.961 --> 30:10.394
He's like, "I don't care."

30:10.396 --> 30:18.335
And I heard three words... "father,"
"landowner," "slave."

30:20.072 --> 30:21.739
One thing you got to
know about the property...

30:21.741 --> 30:23.557
the earliest owners all had slaves.

30:25.111 --> 30:27.061
There was three different
owners that owned your land

30:27.063 --> 30:28.946
that had slaves before
the Civil War broke out.

30:28.948 --> 30:30.664
The last slave owner who lived on the land

30:30.666 --> 30:33.117
was a guy named Joshua Harris,
who came here in 1858.

30:33.119 --> 30:35.903
Big reason I'm thinking it's him

30:35.905 --> 30:38.422
is because of the
relationship with his son.

30:38.424 --> 30:39.557
This guy, Joshua Harris,

30:39.559 --> 30:41.191
was a big supporter of the Confederacy.

30:41.193 --> 30:42.610
It was where we lived, obviously.

30:42.612 --> 30:43.727
Now, I have a census here

30:43.729 --> 30:46.764
that says he was a reserve militia

30:46.766 --> 30:48.732
for the Confederate army.

30:48.734 --> 30:50.034
This guy was in his mid-'50s,

30:50.036 --> 30:52.069
so that'll give you an idea
of how supportive he was.

30:52.071 --> 30:55.839
Now, he had a son named James who was 20,

30:55.841 --> 30:57.308
and he enlisted in the Confederate Army.

30:57.310 --> 30:59.677
Now, he had another son,
Franklin, who was 19,

30:59.679 --> 31:01.812
who refused to go off and fight.

31:01.814 --> 31:05.583
Now, the genealogist I spoke
to about the Harris family

31:05.585 --> 31:07.351
said that it probably
caused a lot of tension

31:07.353 --> 31:08.686
within the family.

31:08.688 --> 31:11.789
That's the only guy I can
think of that fits that bill.

31:12.775 --> 31:15.159
Yeah.

31:15.161 --> 31:16.560
Sounds like them.

31:16.562 --> 31:20.381
Now,
the thing about this Joshua Harris guy...

31:20.383 --> 31:22.082
he's actually buried right
here on the property.

31:22.084 --> 31:24.168
Oh, my God.

31:24.170 --> 31:26.870
You could probably throw a
rock how far he is from here.

31:26.872 --> 31:30.374
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

31:30.376 --> 31:31.792
Wow.

31:31.794 --> 31:34.178
We had absolutely no
idea he was over there.

31:39.752 --> 31:43.520
So,
when I was talking to the older man,

31:43.522 --> 31:47.408
he showed me that there
were two rooms in the house

31:47.410 --> 31:50.728
that were the most active,

31:50.730 --> 31:52.796
and these were two bedrooms,
male and a female.

31:52.798 --> 31:58.969
And when I walked upstairs,
I knew exactly the two bedrooms,

31:58.971 --> 32:02.072
and that this was, in fact,
what he showed me.

32:02.074 --> 32:06.076
So I went into the room where the boy was,

32:06.078 --> 32:09.213
and a lot of the chaos in there

32:09.215 --> 32:13.417
was the extreme amount of noise...

32:13.419 --> 32:14.635
movement.

32:14.637 --> 32:17.187
The window's what I got
was making the female

32:17.189 --> 32:22.126
in the other room feel,
like, sad and isolated,

32:22.128 --> 32:25.462
because the boy had kind of pulled away

32:25.464 --> 32:29.016
from being so close.

32:31.170 --> 32:33.337
Is what she's saying
making any sense to you?

32:33.339 --> 32:34.638
She's nailing it.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.641
That's exactly how I feel all the time.

32:37.643 --> 32:42.680
It's like he's really distanced
himself from everybody.

32:42.682 --> 32:47.985
Well, then I went into the other room,

32:47.987 --> 32:54.358
and what I was seeing was
horrible nightmares...

32:54.360 --> 32:56.460
horrible.

32:56.462 --> 33:04.134
And I saw, like, you waking up
occasionally in strange places.

33:04.136 --> 33:08.305
We talked about that...
how you sleepwalk.

33:08.307 --> 33:10.941
Yeah. I know that I woke up
in my brother's room before.

33:10.943 --> 33:14.311
Tell Amy about some of
those dreams you had.

33:14.313 --> 33:18.015
Well, there were a bunch of people outside.

33:18.017 --> 33:20.017
Everything just had this red...

33:20.019 --> 33:22.052
- Glow?
- tint, yes.

33:22.054 --> 33:24.021
And everybody was dancing,

33:24.023 --> 33:27.991
and then they all looked
up like they saw somebody,

33:27.993 --> 33:31.128
but when I would look,
I would just wake up.

33:31.130 --> 33:32.763
Interesting.

33:32.765 --> 33:34.782
It was very weird.

33:34.784 --> 33:36.517
Hm.

33:36.519 --> 33:41.138
So, what I saw was,
during some of these nightmares,

33:41.140 --> 33:44.007
that there was actually
phenomena going on...

33:44.009 --> 33:48.529
like, lights flickering,
doors opening and closing,

33:48.531 --> 33:51.381
objects moving, things of that nature.

33:51.383 --> 33:55.385
When I was younger, it
was just minor stuff,

33:55.387 --> 33:56.553
like drawers pulling out.

33:56.555 --> 33:58.055
I remember that my whole life.

33:58.057 --> 34:00.023
Me and Hunter walked through one day,

34:00.025 --> 34:01.658
just a couple of weeks ago,

34:01.660 --> 34:04.228
and the fireplace pokers about fell over.

34:04.230 --> 34:07.097
Okay.

34:07.099 --> 34:10.967
What I was seeing was you were in the bed,

34:10.969 --> 34:17.007
and I saw these three things
that were surrounding the bed.

34:17.009 --> 34:21.360
And at first I thought,
"Okay, those are children,"

34:21.362 --> 34:25.599
'cause they're little,
all-black, like black shadow,

34:25.601 --> 34:27.684
but solid.

34:27.686 --> 34:31.989
Then I saw that one was
actually grabbing your feet,

34:31.991 --> 34:36.460
and the other one, up by your head,

34:36.462 --> 34:38.862
had its hand over your mouth.

34:38.864 --> 34:41.931
What they were doing was manhandling you,

34:41.934 --> 34:47.004
basically incapacitating you...

34:47.005 --> 34:48.672
holding you down,

34:48.674 --> 34:52.141
and they were laughing at
you because you were afraid.

34:54.346 --> 34:56.897
The other thing I saw in your room

34:56.899 --> 34:58.515
was the old man again,

34:58.517 --> 35:02.419
and he loves when this is going on.

35:02.421 --> 35:04.555
He thinks it's absolutely fascinating.

35:04.557 --> 35:05.839
And that's why he goes up

35:05.841 --> 35:08.091
and he'll watch when this is all happening.

35:08.093 --> 35:11.295
She's got some stuff going on.

35:11.297 --> 35:12.763
She feels like she's being spooned in bed.

35:12.765 --> 35:14.798
Yes.

35:14.800 --> 35:18.418
I woke up,
and I could feel something behind me,

35:18.420 --> 35:22.039
spooning me, and its head was,
like, right here,

35:22.041 --> 35:23.624
and I couldn't move.

35:23.626 --> 35:25.442
I couldn't breathe. I couldn't cry.

35:25.444 --> 35:30.380
I couldn't turn my light on.
And it scratched me.

35:30.382 --> 35:34.551
I've woken up with scratches on my back.

35:34.553 --> 35:36.720
Oh, man.

35:36.722 --> 35:38.372
You kind of gasped when you heard

35:38.374 --> 35:39.857
that she was spooned in bed.

35:39.859 --> 35:41.825
Well, that happened to me.

35:43.979 --> 35:48.131
It was the second night after the walk.

35:48.133 --> 35:50.467
I was in my bed,

35:50.469 --> 35:55.973
and I felt someone from
behind was holding me,

35:55.975 --> 36:01.144
and it felt very uncomfortable
and inappropriate.

36:01.146 --> 36:04.715
And I believe it's the old man.

36:04.717 --> 36:09.303
I think he's kind of a predator.

36:11.857 --> 36:14.191
I've begged it to leave her alone.

36:14.193 --> 36:16.159
I wish I could go up there

36:16.161 --> 36:21.031
and slap the [bleep] out of it,
honestly, and make it leave.

36:21.033 --> 36:24.201
I don't even want it to
see that I'm afraid,

36:24.203 --> 36:27.170
'cause in a way, that means it wins.

36:29.575 --> 36:33.677
Well, I did do a sketch of
what I saw in the bedroom.

36:44.556 --> 36:46.790
I got to show it to you.

36:57.369 --> 36:58.619
I've seen that.

37:13.656 --> 37:17.624
I did do a sketch of
what I saw in the bedroom.

37:27.436 --> 37:30.137
I got to show it to you.

37:40.532 --> 37:42.349
I've seen that.

37:50.259 --> 37:52.326
The reason I know I've seen that...

37:52.328 --> 37:54.845
that's what was trying to touch me.

38:00.969 --> 38:02.619
When I got here, I told you guys

38:02.621 --> 38:04.104
I never know what Amy's gonna see,

38:04.106 --> 38:06.473
and I'm sure you weren't expecting

38:06.475 --> 38:08.775
to hear what she told us tonight.

38:08.777 --> 38:10.243
I wasn't expecting it.

38:10.245 --> 38:12.129
At least now you know
what you're dealing with.

38:12.131 --> 38:13.714
The big question is how do you fix it.

38:13.716 --> 38:17.417
For that answer, I'll turn it over to Amy.

38:20.189 --> 38:23.457
The first thing
that I want to focus on

38:23.459 --> 38:27.327
are the dead individuals
that you have in the house.

38:27.329 --> 38:30.030
Obviously, the older man needs to go.

38:30.032 --> 38:36.670
So I would like for you to bring
in an older, male medium.

38:36.672 --> 38:41.775
I want him to have a lot of
confidence in what he does,

38:41.777 --> 38:44.111
and I do want him to have a certain amount

38:44.113 --> 38:47.614
of, like, gruff, I guess you would say.

38:47.616 --> 38:52.319
This probably isn't going to
be a very pleasant situation

38:52.321 --> 38:55.322
for the medium or this old man,

38:55.324 --> 38:59.626
and there's probably going to
be a lot of fighting happening.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.780
The thing with removing the older man

39:03.782 --> 39:07.768
is that his son is going to go immediately.

39:07.770 --> 39:10.604
Once the medium moves on
the older man and his son,

39:10.606 --> 39:13.006
I want you to take this tar water

39:13.008 --> 39:15.442
and put it on all of the windowsills

39:15.444 --> 39:17.177
and all of the doorways.

39:17.179 --> 39:19.646
This is gonna keep all of
the dead out from now on,

39:19.648 --> 39:23.483
so you'll know there's
no dead people anymore.

39:23.485 --> 39:28.588
But you might still have experiences.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.859
What do you mean?

39:32.861 --> 39:35.996
Well, I'm saying that there's
a possibility of aliens...

39:38.700 --> 39:45.005
because that thing I
saw was not a dead thing.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.406
It's not a demon.

39:46.408 --> 39:49.910
It's something that was visiting

39:49.912 --> 39:52.679
and taking you...

39:52.681 --> 39:53.713
and your brother.

39:57.286 --> 39:59.586
Personally,
I have a lot of issues with this,

39:59.588 --> 40:03.857
but when I looked and did my
own research of this area,

40:03.859 --> 40:07.527
it was something that
I couldn't not discuss.

40:07.529 --> 40:09.029
Let me get this straight.

40:09.031 --> 40:12.833
You're telling me she's being abducted...
her and her brother?

40:12.835 --> 40:15.769
I'm saying it's a very large possibility.

40:15.771 --> 40:18.038
Oh, gosh.

40:19.475 --> 40:21.341
I don't... I wouldn't even know

40:21.343 --> 40:23.426
how you would begin to
fight something like that.

40:23.428 --> 40:27.247
That's a whole nother level

40:27.249 --> 40:30.484
of what the [bleep] do you do with that.

40:33.055 --> 40:36.122
Now,
is this something they can put a stop to,

40:36.124 --> 40:37.290
or is it something that
they just kind of manage it?

40:37.292 --> 40:39.693
They kind of manage it.

40:42.764 --> 40:44.598
What I would recommend is keeping a journal

40:44.600 --> 40:48.802
and kind of just documenting,
like, any dreams you have,

40:48.804 --> 40:50.770
or any further experiences,

40:50.772 --> 40:53.740
so that you have as much
recall as possible.

40:53.742 --> 40:58.354
And it's really up to you
how you want to handle this.

40:58.377 --> 41:01.304
It's not gonna be something
that's on a regular basis.

41:01.404 --> 41:02.669
That would be highly unusual.

41:02.671 --> 41:04.534
So you can live with it.

41:04.536 --> 41:05.800
How do you feel, Jess?

41:05.802 --> 41:07.167
I mean, you're the one
that's the main focus

41:07.169 --> 41:08.168
of what's going on.

41:09.705 --> 41:12.841
I didn't really want to believe

41:12.843 --> 41:15.643
that it was something
from another dimension

41:15.645 --> 41:17.744
or anything like that,

41:17.746 --> 41:20.545
but I have no choice but to
believe what Amy tells me

41:20.547 --> 41:22.514
and to do what she tells me to do.

41:22.516 --> 41:25.687
To me, this sounds pretty simple,

41:25.689 --> 41:28.487
as far as getting rid of
the spirits that are here

41:28.489 --> 41:32.362
and knowing that we can
prevent any more coming in.

41:32.364 --> 41:35.897
The other we'll just have
to tackle as a family,

41:35.899 --> 41:39.269
as we do other things, and
we'll work through it somehow.

41:39.271 --> 41:44.274
I honestly feel hat God gives us the tools

41:44.276 --> 41:46.744
to do whatever we need to do.

41:46.746 --> 41:48.079
He led us to y'all.

41:50.283 --> 41:53.450
I wish I had better news
for Jeff and his family,

41:53.452 --> 41:56.553
as dealing with alien
activity can be terrifying.

41:56.555 --> 41:59.123
But I believe if they follow my advice,

41:59.125 --> 42:00.858
they'll be able to manage it,

42:00.860 --> 42:02.628
and with the help of a medium,

42:02.630 --> 42:05.598
the dead will no longer
torment them in their home.
