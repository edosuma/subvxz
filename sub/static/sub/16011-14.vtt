01:54.120 --> 01:55.920
[ghostly voice] Ooooo...

01:59.600 --> 02:02.400
Ooooooooo!

02:02.440 --> 02:03.640
[whispering] Paula!

02:07.880 --> 02:09.080
What was that?!

02:09.120 --> 02:10.560
A scary disembodied voice!

02:12.040 --> 02:13.360
No, what was that

02:13.361 --> 02:14.680
you threw at me.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.400
[ghostly voice] Ooooooooo!

02:17.440 --> 02:19.320
- There's a scary
- disembodied voice?

02:19.360 --> 02:20.960
[ghostly voice] Oooooooh...

02:21.000 --> 02:22.080
What was that?!

02:24.400 --> 02:25.680
[exhales]

02:25.720 --> 02:27.960
[ghostly voice] Ooooooo!

02:35.400 --> 02:39.680
Ooooooo!

02:44.440 --> 02:45.800
[dialing]

02:45.840 --> 02:47.680
Vincent? Were you sleeping?

02:47.720 --> 02:48.760
There's a spooky noise

02:48.761 --> 02:49.800
going on over here!

02:49.840 --> 02:51.400
Meet us at the basement! Hurry!

02:53.280 --> 02:54.380
- Come on, Paula!

02:54.381 --> 02:55.480
- Great.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.776
- [whispering] All I'm saying is,
- if I were a ghost,

03:00.800 --> 03:02.620
I think I'd have better things

03:02.621 --> 03:04.440
to say than just "ooooo".

03:04.480 --> 03:05.560
[whispering] They like

03:05.561 --> 03:06.640
to scare people.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.320
It's what ghosts do.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.200
But "Ooooo" isn't scary.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.096
- If I wanted to scare people
- I'd say something like...

03:12.120 --> 03:13.800
- BOO!
- [girls scream]

03:15.600 --> 03:17.180
Okay, "Boo" is a little scarier

03:17.181 --> 03:18.760
than "ooooo".

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And the mask is cool, right?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.240
You gotta give me that.

03:24.760 --> 03:28.120
[ghostly voice] Ooooooo!

03:29.520 --> 03:31.720
Alright, we all go together.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.680
- No one can be scared
- if we're all together.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.920
Guys! Come with me!

03:40.960 --> 03:43.640
That's what "go together" means!

03:43.680 --> 03:46.560
I can't move my legs.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.120
I have an allergy to corridors.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.400
[faking] AAACHOOO!

03:55.640 --> 03:59.400
[ghostly voice] Ooooooo!

04:02.960 --> 04:06.240
Ooooooo!

04:06.280 --> 04:07.320
Hello?

04:12.240 --> 04:13.720
Oh boy.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.200
Dark is almost never good.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.400
Spooky noises can wait.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.080
Centopia here I come!

04:28.640 --> 04:29.920
[Vincent] Mia?!

04:29.960 --> 04:32.720
[ghostly voice] Ooooooo!

04:32.760 --> 04:34.120
Mia!

04:41.800 --> 04:43.700
Violetta has a voice recorder

04:43.701 --> 04:45.600
just like that.

04:45.640 --> 04:46.880
I bet she does.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.440
Ooooooooo!

04:50.480 --> 04:52.936
- It was right inside the air duct
- that leads up to our room.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.200
And set on "loop".

04:55.240 --> 04:57.736
- We've got a little job to do.
- Meet me outside in five minutes.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.640
- I'll make sure
- there aren't any more.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.700
Any more?

05:00.701 --> 05:01.720
Why would there be...

05:04.080 --> 05:05.560
Right.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.700
Can't be too careful.

05:06.701 --> 05:07.800
Come on, Paula.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.160
Hi Mia. Say your password.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.780
"Where trees stand tall

05:25.781 --> 05:27.360
yet cry alone,

05:27.400 --> 05:28.620
follow the path

05:28.621 --> 05:29.840
to heed their moan."

05:43.360 --> 05:46.400
[screams]

05:50.400 --> 05:53.040
Aaaaaaaahhh....

05:53.080 --> 05:54.120
Woooooooooo!

05:54.160 --> 05:55.960
Agh!

05:56.000 --> 05:58.160
[coughs]

05:58.200 --> 05:59.500
[coughs]

05:59.501 --> 06:00.800
Oh hi! Whatcha doing?

06:00.840 --> 06:03.360
We were collecting unicorn dust.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.880
[coughs]

06:04.920 --> 06:06.800
What happened?

06:06.840 --> 06:09.200
Oh, I should have known.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.560
Hi Mia.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.560
Oops. Hi Mo... Sorry.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.440
[neigh]

06:14.480 --> 06:15.520
Onchao!

06:18.040 --> 06:19.320
[laughs] I'm glad

06:19.321 --> 06:20.600
to see you too.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.820
So Mia,

06:21.821 --> 06:23.000
what does the oracle say?

06:23.040 --> 06:24.600
You guys ready for this?

06:24.640 --> 06:25.960
"Where trees stand tall

06:25.961 --> 06:27.280
yet cry alone,

06:27.320 --> 06:28.500
follow the path

06:28.501 --> 06:29.680
to heed their moan".

06:30.840 --> 06:32.080
That could be anywhere.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.680
No it couldn't.

06:33.720 --> 06:34.840
Sure it could!

06:34.880 --> 06:37.160
A place, trees, a path.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.000
It's not specific enough.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.640
Hello?! Is Prince Mo in there?!

06:41.680 --> 06:43.120
It's the Wizened Woods!

06:43.160 --> 06:45.040
What are the Wizened Woods?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.680
It's an old forest.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.320
A HAUNTED old forest.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.040
Great. Out of one scary place

06:51.041 --> 06:52.720
and straight into another.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.160
Fine, we can check out

06:54.161 --> 06:55.560
the Wizened Woods if you want.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.040
But it's a waste of time.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.720
What was that all about?

06:59.760 --> 07:00.920
Beats me.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.560
Probably just Mo being Mo.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.040
You know how boys are.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.420
[Panthea] No... this is

07:18.421 --> 07:20.520
not good, not good at all.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.700
Ziggo, my precious,

07:22.701 --> 07:24.840
do I look old today?

07:24.880 --> 07:26.680
[screeches]

07:26.720 --> 07:29.280
I'll take that as a "maybe".

07:32.120 --> 07:34.720
Mmmm... No wonder.

07:34.760 --> 07:35.960
Gargona!

07:37.000 --> 07:38.520
You screamed, my Queen.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.400
I need wood for my Hour Glass!

07:40.440 --> 07:42.100
I will chop down

07:42.101 --> 07:43.760
a sapling immediately.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.920
No!

07:44.960 --> 07:46.560
It must be dead trees

07:46.600 --> 07:48.760
from the Wizened Woods!

07:48.800 --> 07:50.960
The Wizened Woods?

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
But my Queen, wood is wood, yes?

07:54.040 --> 07:55.480
Let's find out.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.560
Not my...

08:00.480 --> 08:03.280
favourite spear.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.480
See?

08:04.520 --> 08:06.240
Any other wood blazes up

08:06.280 --> 08:08.680
and scorches my hourglass!

08:08.720 --> 08:09.900
Only dead wood

08:09.901 --> 08:11.080
from the Wizened Woods

08:11.120 --> 08:14.040
burns hot and low enough!

08:14.080 --> 08:15.140
But the Wizened Woods

08:15.141 --> 08:16.200
are... are...

08:16.240 --> 08:17.440
Haunted?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.960
BAH! Superstitious nonsense!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.160
Now go get the wood

08:21.161 --> 08:22.320
for this magical fire

08:22.360 --> 08:24.440
to make my enchanted hourglass

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
turn me young again!

08:28.280 --> 08:29.680
NOW!!!!!!

08:37.159 --> 08:38.840
There they are.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.880
[Yuko] The Wizened Woods.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.100
The oracle said

08:42.101 --> 08:43.280
to "Follow the path..."?

08:43.320 --> 08:44.360
What path?!

08:44.400 --> 08:46.800
Is that it? Or that?

08:46.840 --> 08:48.100
Whichever it is, we'll never

08:48.101 --> 08:49.360
follow it from the air.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.200
[croaking and whistling]

09:09.240 --> 09:11.160
- What was that?
- [Mia] Birds and frogs.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.600
- Ah... I knew that.
- [giggles nervously]

09:14.640 --> 09:16.520
I don't believe it!

09:16.560 --> 09:17.620
You're scared

09:17.621 --> 09:18.680
of the Wizened Woods!

09:18.720 --> 09:20.200
- That's crazy! I...
- [crack]

09:20.240 --> 09:21.720
Aah!

09:21.760 --> 09:22.920
What was that?

09:28.240 --> 09:29.320
[Mo] Unicorns.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.240
Uuh... I knew that.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.000
[neighs]

09:35.480 --> 09:36.640
[neighs]

09:40.080 --> 09:42.200
- [Mia] It's okay,
- we don't mean you any harm.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.760
What are you doing here?

09:45.080 --> 09:46.240
[neighs]

09:47.720 --> 09:49.360
- He says they used to
- take this path

09:49.400 --> 09:51.096
- To get to their meadow
- on the other side.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.320
But they're scared.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.320
They say the trees have voices.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.840
[ghostly murmurs]

09:58.880 --> 10:00.160
[Yuko] (GULPS) I can't imagine

10:00.161 --> 10:01.440
why that would scare them.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.900
We could sure use some guides

10:02.901 --> 10:04.320
who know the path.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.320
We'll keep you safe.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.120
- Nobody will harm you
- or your family.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.080
Alright. Lead the way!

10:16.480 --> 10:17.520
Croak!

10:20.280 --> 10:22.360
Gotta get the Trumptus piece.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.040
Come on Mo, you can do this.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.960
[ghostly murmurs]

10:37.920 --> 10:39.620
Keep cutting, you fools!

10:39.621 --> 10:41.320
It's only the wind.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.920
And chop faster.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.760
- I don't wanna
- be in here all day.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.680
[ghostly murmur]

10:48.720 --> 10:49.960
Iiii...

10:54.040 --> 10:56.040
Aaaaghhhh!

10:58.520 --> 10:59.840
Just stretching my legs...

10:59.841 --> 11:01.160
in case you were interested.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.000
Huh... let's try another spot.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.080
Is this even a path?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.400
They seem to think so.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.880
[ghostly sounds]

11:17.920 --> 11:18.960
[neigh loudly]

11:20.240 --> 11:21.380
Why do the trees

11:21.381 --> 11:22.520
make that sound?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.060
Because Panthea's been chopping

11:24.061 --> 11:25.560
them down for some reason.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.740
Their despair

11:26.741 --> 11:27.880
keeps them like this.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.180
Not-quite-dead,

11:29.181 --> 11:30.440
not-quite-alive.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.940
[Mo] Even unicorn dust

11:33.941 --> 11:35.400
doesn't work here anymore.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.640
[neighing]

11:36.680 --> 11:38.200
[Yuko] The unicorns are nervous.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.800
We should stick close.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.280
Croak! Croak!

11:42.320 --> 11:43.360
[gasps]

11:43.400 --> 11:44.440
Croak!

11:54.880 --> 11:56.200
Are you okay, Mo?

11:56.240 --> 11:58.760
Yes... no... I...

11:58.800 --> 12:00.040
think I heard Muncs.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.880
Maybe I should go check it out.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.120
Yeah, good idea.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.920
We'll find the Trumptus piece

12:07.960 --> 12:09.120
while you keep an eye out

12:09.121 --> 12:10.280
for any danger, okay?

12:13.840 --> 12:14.920
SPLASH!

12:14.960 --> 12:16.440
Just warming up.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.880
That's not like him.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.640
Mo's not afraid of anything...

12:19.680 --> 12:20.880
normally.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.760
Yeah but, there's nothing normal

12:22.800 --> 12:24.600
about this place!

12:24.640 --> 12:26.080
Great.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.536
- Now Yuko and Mia
- think I'm afraid

12:27.560 --> 12:29.560
Of a bunch of trees.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.920
Forget it. I'm going...

12:30.960 --> 12:32.000
Croak!

12:36.320 --> 12:37.400
Croak!

12:39.640 --> 12:41.720
I'll head back in a minute...

12:45.040 --> 12:46.640
[ghostly moaning]

12:48.000 --> 12:50.120
[neighs]

12:50.160 --> 12:51.580
He says this is the oldest part

12:51.581 --> 12:53.000
of the forest.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.200
- [Yuko] This is where the trees
- moan the loudest.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.580
If we're looking for

12:56.581 --> 12:57.920
"where trees cry alone",

12:57.960 --> 12:59.240
this is the place.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.320
[neighs]

13:02.800 --> 13:04.160
[sniffs]

13:04.200 --> 13:05.400
[neighs]

13:05.440 --> 13:07.280
Yep, this is the place alright.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.240
This poor tree.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.200
- It must be
- thousands of years old!

13:20.760 --> 13:21.920
[Yuko] It doesn't work here,

13:21.921 --> 13:23.080
remember?

13:23.120 --> 13:24.560
I had to try.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.720
What about Onchao?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.360
Why didn't I think of that?!

13:29.400 --> 13:30.620
Onchao! Come see

13:30.621 --> 13:31.840
what you can do with this!

13:32.880 --> 13:35.040
Croak! Croak!

13:37.960 --> 13:39.080
[ghostly moaning]

13:40.920 --> 13:42.760
Okay, you can do it, Mo.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.240
Focus on the positive.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.640
You're not afraid of Muncs

13:48.680 --> 13:49.900
or dragons,

13:49.901 --> 13:51.120
or Gargona, or...

13:51.160 --> 13:53.160
- [Gargona] Come one, come on!
- Hurry up!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.500
[Gargona] No, those trees

13:54.501 --> 13:55.800
aren't dead enough!

13:55.840 --> 13:57.640
We have to go deeper!

13:57.680 --> 13:59.440
Move, you cowards.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.440
Follow that path!

14:01.480 --> 14:03.400
Go on!

14:03.440 --> 14:04.740
[to herself] Because I'm sure

14:04.741 --> 14:06.040
not going first!

14:06.080 --> 14:08.440
Okay, I gotta do this.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.040
Here goes!

14:10.080 --> 14:11.120
[inhales deeply]

14:13.320 --> 14:14.360
[exhales]

14:14.400 --> 14:16.160
For Mia and Yuko.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.440
That's it, Onchao! It's working!

14:24.720 --> 14:26.080
You gotta love that little guy!

14:26.120 --> 14:27.760
[Gargona] Dead ones over there!

14:27.800 --> 14:29.640
- Hack them to bits
- and then let's go.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.780
[whispers] We have to get

14:30.781 --> 14:31.880
the unicorns out of here.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.500
[whispers] Stick with us.

14:34.501 --> 14:35.600
This way.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.840
This one!

14:47.280 --> 14:48.960
There's enough wood here

14:49.000 --> 14:50.700
to keep Panthea happy

14:50.701 --> 14:52.400
for a year.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.600
- [whispers] That tree's been here
- for centuries.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.920
I'm not going watch them

14:55.921 --> 14:57.200
destroy it in five minutes!

14:57.240 --> 14:58.720
There's too many.

14:58.760 --> 14:59.960
And they'll find

14:59.961 --> 15:01.160
the unicorns for sure.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.300
If Mo was here,

15:02.301 --> 15:03.400
we could take them.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.520
It's not about you, Mo.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.160
Gotta save Yuko and Mia.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.480
It's not about you.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.800
Croak!

15:11.840 --> 15:13.480
Oh oh. Time to hurry.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.600
DING DING!

15:14.640 --> 15:15.840
Take me to Yuko!

15:27.120 --> 15:28.776
- [whispering] We have
- to make them stop.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.280
[Yuko] (WHISPERING) Let's go!

15:30.320 --> 15:31.560
Huh?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.560
Are we glad to see you!

15:35.600 --> 15:36.900
Make sure Onchao

15:36.901 --> 15:38.200
and the unicorns are safe.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.480
They're probably

15:39.481 --> 15:40.720
scared crazy from this.

15:40.760 --> 15:41.800
Yuko and I

15:41.801 --> 15:42.840
will deal with the Muncs.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.240
Got a plan?

15:44.280 --> 15:46.720
[moans]

15:46.760 --> 15:48.080
I do now.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.640
[ghostly murmurs]

15:53.600 --> 15:55.400
It's just the wind.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.000
Keep cutting.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.480
[Mo] (SCARY) Oooohhh.

15:58.520 --> 15:59.920
EEEEEhhhhh...

15:59.960 --> 16:01.200
whaaaaahhh.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.680
[Yuko] (SCARY) Ayyyyiieeeee!!!

16:06.200 --> 16:07.240
[giggles]

16:08.720 --> 16:10.400
[cracking sounds]

16:18.880 --> 16:21.240
[Yuko] Wwhhoooohhhaaaaaaii!

16:21.280 --> 16:23.520
Booooohhhh!

16:23.560 --> 16:25.560
Whhhooooo!

16:30.400 --> 16:31.960
Wait. Stop.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.440
We can't leave yet!

16:33.480 --> 16:35.160
[Mo] Oh yes you can!

16:40.200 --> 16:41.440
[Yuko] The sooner the better!

16:43.920 --> 16:45.240
Elves!!!!

16:45.280 --> 16:47.480
I should have known!!!

16:54.360 --> 16:56.200
Oh!

16:56.240 --> 16:57.640
Take the wood!

16:57.680 --> 17:00.000
We can't go back without wood!

17:02.840 --> 17:03.920
All clear!

17:14.319 --> 17:15.920
Mo! Look what

17:15.921 --> 17:17.520
they've done to this tree!

17:18.720 --> 17:20.280
We can't leave it like this.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.540
Onchao? Can you try

17:21.540 --> 17:22.760
to help it again?

17:41.880 --> 17:43.280
[neighing]

17:45.080 --> 17:46.760
He needs help! Hurry!

18:03.720 --> 18:05.300
That tree's going to get up and

18:05.301 --> 18:06.880
walk away if we keep that up!

18:11.080 --> 18:12.680
Great work Onchao!

18:12.720 --> 18:14.080
This forest has a second chance,

18:14.081 --> 18:15.440
because of you.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.520
[neighs]

18:17.240 --> 18:18.280
[sniffs]

18:25.840 --> 18:27.280
Ha ha! That can

18:27.281 --> 18:28.720
only be one thing!

18:28.760 --> 18:29.920
[Mia] The Trumptus piece!

18:29.960 --> 18:31.920
Atta boy, Onchao!

18:37.440 --> 18:38.900
Thank you, um... tree.

18:38.901 --> 18:40.360
[giggles]

18:40.400 --> 18:41.480
I've never talked

18:41.481 --> 18:42.560
to a tree before.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.100
You've already done

18:56.101 --> 18:57.240
so much Onchao,

18:57.280 --> 18:59.080
- but if you have
- a little more energy...

18:59.120 --> 19:00.440
[neighs]

19:04.560 --> 19:06.880
Aaah!

19:06.920 --> 19:09.160
[giggles] A little help here?

19:14.280 --> 19:15.560
There's still some hope

19:15.561 --> 19:16.840
for the old Wizened Woods yet.

19:26.680 --> 19:28.160
Your wood, my Queen.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.960
I live to serve.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.120
And... that's all of it?

19:33.160 --> 19:35.200
There were elves.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.400
And that means you bring me

19:36.401 --> 19:37.560
barely enough wood

19:37.600 --> 19:39.480
to boil a cup of soup?!

19:39.520 --> 19:40.900
I could make you

19:40.901 --> 19:42.280
a cup of soup, my Queen.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.580
Bring me everything

19:43.581 --> 19:44.840
in your chamber made of wood!

19:44.880 --> 19:46.840
It won't burn well,

19:46.841 --> 19:48.800
but it will burn.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.680
Yes... my queen.

19:58.640 --> 19:59.680
[neighs]

20:02.120 --> 20:03.920
- [Mia] That's a good start,
- Onchao.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.280
- We'll have to come back
- when you had a chance to rest.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.560
We'll do what we can

20:07.561 --> 20:08.800
to keep the muncs away.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.680
[neighing]

20:14.120 --> 20:15.400
- Boo!
- Ah!

20:16.880 --> 20:18.880
[girls laugh]

20:21.320 --> 20:24.120
[laughs]

20:24.160 --> 20:25.460
Now that's what trees

20:25.461 --> 20:26.760
are supposed to sound like.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.760
Nothing at all.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.080
Croak!

20:33.200 --> 20:34.520
[Yuko] Mo?

20:35.880 --> 20:37.040
Croak!

20:39.840 --> 20:42.520
You couldn't be scared...

20:42.560 --> 20:43.800
of this???

20:43.840 --> 20:45.200
Ah! Get it away!

20:45.240 --> 20:46.760
Don't let it near me!

20:48.120 --> 20:49.320
This whole time,

20:49.360 --> 20:50.600
it wasn't the haunted trees

20:50.640 --> 20:51.960
you were afraid of?!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.200
It was the FROGS?!

20:54.640 --> 20:56.240
Get down here, you big wimp!

20:56.280 --> 20:57.420
We're gonna deal

20:57.421 --> 20:58.560
with this right now!

21:03.960 --> 21:05.000
Croak!

21:08.160 --> 21:09.460
See? Did it

21:09.461 --> 21:10.760
bite your finger off?

21:10.800 --> 21:13.000
I guess it's not so bad.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.800
He's actually kind of cute.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.440
What was I afraid of?!

21:17.200 --> 21:18.240
Ohhhhh!

21:18.280 --> 21:19.960
That's disgusting!

21:20.000 --> 21:21.840
[laughs]

21:21.880 --> 21:23.040
Oh ya!?

21:23.080 --> 21:24.200
Let's see how you like

21:24.240 --> 21:25.840
being slimed by a frog.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.680
- [Yuko] No, get that thing
- away from me!

21:27.720 --> 21:29.840
[Mo] Ha ha ha! C'mon froggy.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.720
[Mo] Give the elf girl a kiss!

21:31.760 --> 21:33.720
[laughs] Well, I have to deal

21:33.760 --> 21:34.780
with some scary business

21:34.781 --> 21:35.800
of my own.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.800
I'll deal with frog boy.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.960
See ya!

21:40.000 --> 21:41.320
See you soon!

21:43.240 --> 21:45.080
[Yuko] Come back here frog boy!

22:05.520 --> 22:06.680
AAAH!

22:09.520 --> 22:11.480
- Seriously?
- What doesn't scare you?

22:13.120 --> 22:14.800
- Come on guys,
- we have work to do!

22:14.840 --> 22:16.920
What are we going to do?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.560
We're gonna give Violetta

22:18.561 --> 22:20.160
a taste of her own medicine.

22:22.400 --> 22:26.040
[ghostly voice] Ooooooo...

22:30.440 --> 22:33.400
Ooooooo...

22:38.040 --> 22:41.360
Ooooooo...

22:44.360 --> 22:47.360
Ooooooo...

22:49.000 --> 22:50.800
[screams terrified]

22:52.720 --> 22:55.000
[laugh]

22:55.040 --> 22:57.160
That's her.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.620
Ahh good,

22:58.621 --> 23:00.040
I was beginning to worry.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.016
- What do you know, I guess
- with the right conditions,

23:02.040 --> 23:03.800
"ooooo" is scary.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
