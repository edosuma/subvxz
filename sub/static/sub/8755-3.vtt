00:10.536 --> 00:12.382
There's something dangerous here.

00:12.794 --> 00:13.927
And I heard summoning.

00:14.012 --> 00:15.729
It's almost like I was possessed.

00:15.829 --> 00:17.262
It scared me, made me jump.

00:17.364 --> 00:19.531
The injuries make him unrecognizable.

00:19.616 --> 00:22.434
He's getting his face bashed in.

00:22.536 --> 00:24.735
The tray was just thrown out of my hand.

00:24.835 --> 00:26.768
It would be like
cutting out my own heart.

00:26.870 --> 00:28.904
It's really bad.

00:29.006 --> 00:30.605
They're gonna [bleep] kill me.

00:30.707 --> 00:33.608
There's a dark presence.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.744
My name is Amy Allan.

00:35.846 --> 00:37.746
These things, they're freaking out.

00:37.848 --> 00:38.661
They're from hell.

00:38.761 --> 00:39.760
I see dead people.

00:39.862 --> 00:41.028
They were being hunted.

00:41.130 --> 00:42.797
I speak to dead people.

00:42.899 --> 00:44.698
They were setting people on fire,

00:44.801 --> 00:45.833
burning them alive.

00:45.935 --> 00:47.334
And they speak to me.

00:47.437 --> 00:48.636
Her neck got broken.

00:48.738 --> 00:51.605
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:51.707 --> 00:53.607
I hear a gunshot.

00:53.709 --> 00:55.176
I rely on my partner.

00:55.278 --> 00:56.811
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:56.913 --> 00:58.646
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

00:58.748 --> 00:59.914
Something's not right here.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.950
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:03.052 --> 01:04.251
It's not safe here.

01:04.352 --> 01:05.653
It's my job to reveal them.

01:05.755 --> 01:07.171
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:07.290 --> 01:08.189
They're all buried here.

01:08.291 --> 01:10.124
But Steve and I never speak...

01:10.226 --> 01:12.493
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:12.595 --> 01:13.794
Until the very end...

01:13.896 --> 01:15.095
I can't do it no more.

01:15.198 --> 01:16.697
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:16.799 --> 01:18.299
Holy [bleep] Look at this.

01:18.401 --> 01:20.000
Or time to get out.

01:20.102 --> 01:21.469
It does not have a happy ending.

01:21.604 --> 01:23.237
Something kills people here.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074

01:36.819 --> 01:38.452
I'm in Grass Valley, California,

01:38.554 --> 01:40.437
about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.369
I got a call from a guy who
bought an old, historic hotel

01:44.488 --> 01:46.421
and said it was the worst
thing he's ever done.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.107
He says the paranormal
activity there is so bad,

01:49.192 --> 01:52.193
it's attacking his guests,
scaring his employees,

01:52.295 --> 01:55.013
and he even blames it
for causing his divorce.

01:56.904 --> 01:58.636
He says if we can't find a solution,

01:58.736 --> 02:00.202
he's gonna have to shut the place down.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.369
Before Amy arrives, I clear
the area of any leading information.

02:06.469 --> 02:09.570
Photographs and artwork
can influence her findings,

02:09.672 --> 02:11.839
so it's important that I
cover or remove them all.

02:11.941 --> 02:13.474
When I'm finished,

02:13.559 --> 02:16.210
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:24.321 --> 02:25.821
This town is very active.

02:28.492 --> 02:31.059
Everybody is yelling.

02:31.161 --> 02:33.762
This is a long time ago.

02:33.864 --> 02:35.263
Dirt roads.

02:35.349 --> 02:37.499
There were a lot of tragedies here.

02:37.601 --> 02:39.801
And people were angry about them.

02:39.903 --> 02:42.237
They're pissed. They're [bleep] pissed.

02:42.339 --> 02:44.072
There's lots of chaos here.

02:44.174 --> 02:45.173
Ooh.

02:51.582 --> 02:53.833
Well, Ian, it's good
to finally meet you in person.

02:53.933 --> 02:55.333
When we spoke on the phone,

02:55.435 --> 02:57.652
you sounded like you were at
your wits end with this place.

02:57.770 --> 03:00.204
I still come in
every morning, like,

03:00.306 --> 03:01.439
"What's gonna happen today?"

03:01.541 --> 03:03.641
I've had guests check out
in the middle of the night,

03:03.726 --> 03:06.444
say, "I can't stay
here. It's too scary."

03:06.546 --> 03:08.079
I have employees that are afraid

03:08.181 --> 03:09.991
to go to parts of the building alone.

03:11.028 --> 03:12.628
It's stressful.

03:12.730 --> 03:14.096
I'm tired of it.

03:14.181 --> 03:15.481
Now, you mentioned on the phone,

03:15.600 --> 03:16.932
there was a lot of activity here.

03:17.034 --> 03:18.651
Give me an idea what
you're talking about.

03:18.736 --> 03:20.869
I have people hearing noises.

03:20.972 --> 03:24.273
I have objects moving around.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.842
People are being physically touched.

03:26.944 --> 03:28.243
I've even had people say

03:28.346 --> 03:30.270
that they were being sexually assaulted.

03:31.533 --> 03:32.882
- Guests?
- Guests.

03:32.984 --> 03:35.702
It's not just here and
there. It's consistent.

03:35.787 --> 03:37.170
Ian, you mentioned on the phone

03:37.289 --> 03:39.506
that this place may have
even destroyed your marriage.

03:39.624 --> 03:40.630
I mean, what did you mean by that?

03:40.730 --> 03:43.097
After I took over the hotel,

03:43.199 --> 03:45.399
my marriage really
started falling apart.

03:45.501 --> 03:47.268
It changed my personality.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.653
I've talked to people that
have worked here and managed

03:49.772 --> 03:51.772
and owners in the past,

03:51.874 --> 03:53.540
and they said the exact same thing.

03:53.676 --> 03:55.175
It's like, "It ruined my marriage."

03:55.278 --> 03:58.211
I feel like there's
something in the air here,

03:58.311 --> 03:59.644
something in the energy.

03:59.780 --> 04:00.945
I see people acting

04:01.031 --> 04:02.714
in ways that they normally
wouldn't be acting.

04:02.814 --> 04:04.497
Why are you holding on to this place?

04:04.582 --> 04:07.717
You know, I love it. I
still love the Holbrooke.

04:07.802 --> 04:10.186
It's the centerpiece for Grass Valley.

04:10.271 --> 04:12.889
Have you done anything to try
to figure out what's going on?

04:12.974 --> 04:15.441
I've had three different
paranormal groups come in here

04:15.560 --> 04:16.692
over the last four years.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.962
They had video and audio recording.

04:20.065 --> 04:21.164
What did they tell you?

04:21.249 --> 04:22.832
They say there's a lot of activity,

04:22.917 --> 04:25.101
but no one's ever told me
to do anything about it.

04:25.186 --> 04:28.771
They're more interested in
just trying to see what's here.

04:28.857 --> 04:29.872
I want some answers.

04:29.974 --> 04:32.408
I don't want to walk
away from this place.

04:35.002 --> 04:36.051
I think there's a living person

04:36.136 --> 04:38.420
that is doing something very bad here.

04:38.984 --> 04:40.601
And I heard summoning.

04:42.004 --> 04:45.227
And I do see people doing,

04:45.262 --> 04:48.451
very specifically, EVP stuff.

04:48.536 --> 04:50.703
You mean investigations and stuff?

04:50.822 --> 04:52.088
Yeah. Yeah.

04:52.190 --> 04:54.957
I don't know if they're formal

04:55.059 --> 04:57.994
or just something that
these owners or whoever

04:58.079 --> 05:00.963
are doing on their own time,

05:01.065 --> 05:03.499
but whatever it is,
there's an obsession.

05:03.601 --> 05:05.001
Now I'm hearing obsession.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.543
So, what's going on back here?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.314
My equipment in the
kitchen is always breaking.

05:14.416 --> 05:17.929
We'll buy brand-new equipment.
It will fail within a few weeks.

05:18.029 --> 05:20.263
You sure you don't have an
employee here who's trying

05:20.398 --> 05:21.737
to get even with you for
something and breaking [bleep]

05:21.837 --> 05:24.821
It's possible, but I've seen
equipment installed myself,

05:24.956 --> 05:27.824
and it's failed with
a week for no reason.

05:27.909 --> 05:29.626
Now, is anything else going on?

05:29.711 --> 05:32.228
I've had furniture move around in rooms.

05:32.364 --> 05:34.396
I was staying in room number 9.

05:34.496 --> 05:35.011
Okay.

05:35.108 --> 05:36.907
When I went to bed, I
saw where the chair was.

05:37.010 --> 05:39.176
I got up in the middle of
the night to use the restroom,

05:39.278 --> 05:41.212
the chair had moved to a
completely different spot

05:41.347 --> 05:43.414
in the room, and I tripped on it.

05:43.516 --> 05:45.316
- Now, were you alone?
- I was alone.

05:45.401 --> 05:47.368
- You could have broke your neck.
- Yes.

05:47.487 --> 05:49.904
The chair moving in
your bedroom upstairs

05:49.989 --> 05:52.023
when you were staying
over, I can't explain that.

05:52.125 --> 05:55.993
But the rest of this stuff,
the electrical and all that...

05:56.095 --> 05:58.012
it's an old building. You
think this is all paranormal?

05:58.131 --> 05:59.764
There's no logical explanation

05:59.849 --> 06:01.932
for these events that are happening.

06:02.018 --> 06:05.036
I want people to be safe and happy here.

06:05.171 --> 06:06.637
I'm hoping you can help me.

06:09.142 --> 06:11.726
There's an aggressive male here.

06:11.811 --> 06:14.912
He's very, very hyper.

06:15.014 --> 06:17.181
And I hear "Paul."

06:17.283 --> 06:20.668
I am gonna say that he's mentally ill.

06:23.256 --> 06:25.256
He likes it in here.

06:25.341 --> 06:28.559
It feels more comfortable for him.

06:28.661 --> 06:31.162
He likes little spaces.

06:35.302 --> 06:36.501
He is aggressive,

06:36.603 --> 06:40.516
but it's when he feels
like he's being cornered.

06:40.616 --> 06:42.683
He kind of lashes out.

06:42.768 --> 06:44.985
I do see him touching people.

06:45.087 --> 06:49.606
The things he'll do
is, like, hiding things,

06:49.692 --> 06:52.359
breaking things, stuff like that.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.153
So, how long did you work here?

06:59.255 --> 07:00.628
Approximately two years.

07:00.728 --> 07:02.862
I was a front desk agent.

07:02.947 --> 07:05.998
From my understanding, it
looks like Ian saved this hotel.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.750
How important is that for the city?

07:08.395 --> 07:10.662
It's very important for Grass Valley.

07:10.748 --> 07:14.333
The Holbrooke is basically
the heart of this town.

07:14.418 --> 07:17.836
There's so much history, and
everybody loves this place.

07:17.972 --> 07:20.606
Ian was telling me that he
thinks whatever's going on here

07:20.741 --> 07:23.275
is responsible for his
marriage breaking up.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.678
You think whatever's here has
an effect on relationships?

07:26.814 --> 07:29.381
Yes. I've seen a few relationships

07:29.483 --> 07:32.267
that were really,
really strong break up.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.353
There's something here

07:34.455 --> 07:38.524
that doesn't want you to be happy.

07:38.609 --> 07:41.009
Now, when you worked here,
did you have any experiences?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.794
I've actually seen
a shadow figure...

07:42.880 --> 07:45.831
a very tall shadow figure
...ln the kitchen twice.

07:45.931 --> 07:48.098
Now, describe the shadow
figure. How did it look to you?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.683
Tall and dark.

07:49.802 --> 07:53.036
It was definitely taller
than me, over 6 feet tall.

07:53.122 --> 07:55.989
And dark... You
couldn't see through it.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.175
Okay, is there anything
else you've experienced?

07:58.310 --> 08:00.677
I couldn't count how
many times this happened,

08:00.779 --> 08:03.824
sitting here at the
front desk, and I would...

08:04.879 --> 08:07.413
hear my name

08:07.498 --> 08:08.848
and feel a presence.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.766
And they would, you know, call my name,

08:10.885 --> 08:13.085
and I was, "Can I help... you?

08:13.187 --> 08:14.600
Oh, there's nobody there."

08:14.700 --> 08:16.600
Are you sure it couldn't
have been somebody

08:16.685 --> 08:17.801
that came in from outside?

08:17.886 --> 08:21.488
Absolutely. No one gets
in without me noticing.

08:21.607 --> 08:25.091
- The doors are locked.
- Okay.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.910
There's a woman,

08:27.012 --> 08:30.975
and she is a force to be reckoned with.

08:33.251 --> 08:37.087
She's in charge, you
know, with an iron fist.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.424
She's trying to talk to people.

08:42.561 --> 08:44.094
It bothers them.

08:44.229 --> 08:45.862
She touches them, and it's burning.

08:45.964 --> 08:48.965
It's hot. It's hot. It's so hot.

08:49.067 --> 08:52.869
And then she's got, like, this
whole white mist thing going on.

08:57.169 --> 09:00.934
The living see her kind of
as a full-bodied apparition,

09:01.034 --> 09:03.251
sometimes crying, sometimes yelling,

09:03.336 --> 09:06.004
and sometimes being very forceful.

09:06.106 --> 09:08.089
What is she trying to tell people?

09:08.208 --> 09:10.842
She's in trouble. She needs help.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.295
So, Andrew, I understand
that you actually work here.

09:34.395 --> 09:36.311
Yes, sir. I
used to also live here.

09:36.414 --> 09:37.346
- You lived here?
- Yeah.

09:37.448 --> 09:39.114
- For how long?
- For about seven months.

09:39.216 --> 09:41.049
- Okay, what do you do?
- Now I'm maintenance.

09:41.135 --> 09:43.318
I used to do everything
from front desk, night audit,

09:43.404 --> 09:44.620
fill in for bartending.

09:44.722 --> 09:46.605
So you basically know
the whole building.

09:46.724 --> 09:47.790
In and out.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.858
Okay. Now, you've
experienced some stuff.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.026
Oh, absolutely, yes.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.411
Okay, what can you tell me?

09:52.496 --> 09:55.297
I've seen shadows and shadow figures,

09:55.433 --> 09:57.933
one with a hat that
was down in the kitchen.

09:58.035 --> 09:59.051
It was a dark figure,

09:59.170 --> 10:01.003
and you could tell there
was something there,

10:01.105 --> 10:02.771
and it scared me. Made me jump,

10:02.857 --> 10:06.475
like you or somebody was right
next to me and I didn't know it.

10:06.577 --> 10:07.636
And you were alone in the kitchen.

10:07.736 --> 10:08.936
Mm-hmm.

10:09.021 --> 10:11.171
Okay. Is there anything else going on?

10:11.290 --> 10:13.457
We get a lot of complaints from guests.

10:13.542 --> 10:14.658
Okay, like what?

10:14.793 --> 10:17.177
I've had guests check out
in the middle of the night,

10:17.263 --> 10:19.163
complaints of noise above their roof

10:19.265 --> 10:21.732
when they're on the top floor,
and there's nobody up there,

10:21.817 --> 10:25.152
or the temperatures changing,
or their doorknob keeps rattling.

10:25.271 --> 10:26.171
It's an old building.

10:26.271 --> 10:27.804
I'm sure there's some
quirky things going on,

10:27.904 --> 10:29.537
but that's pretty drastic.

10:30.003 --> 10:32.522
I had a family that checked
in about 3:00 in the afternoon,

10:32.622 --> 10:34.372
and husband and wife
left the son upstairs

10:34.457 --> 10:36.007
in the room to take a nap.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.659
They were eating downstairs, and
he came barging into the saloon,

10:38.761 --> 10:40.461
asked for the car
key, stayed in the car.

10:40.563 --> 10:42.129
He would not come back up to the room.

10:42.232 --> 10:43.564
Did you find out what happened?

10:43.650 --> 10:45.816
We ask him what was going
on. He said he felt something

10:45.902 --> 10:48.402
massaging, like, his legs or his back.

10:48.488 --> 10:50.054
And knowing nobody was in the room,

10:50.173 --> 10:52.507
he just jumped up out of the
room and was not going back.

10:52.642 --> 10:54.976
Wow. That would have scared
the hell out of me, I think.

10:55.078 --> 10:57.211
It's almost like it's...

10:57.297 --> 10:59.096
malicious in a way.

11:06.359 --> 11:09.666
I think that there's
something dangerous here.

11:10.844 --> 11:14.826
And someone's just [bleep] choking bad.

11:14.926 --> 11:17.526
There's a guy

11:17.612 --> 11:19.996
strangling a woman

11:20.098 --> 11:22.098
with his hand.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.634
He's, like, just holding her down.

11:24.736 --> 11:26.202
Real strong.

11:28.539 --> 11:31.007
Living people are experiencing this,

11:31.109 --> 11:35.995
like, little snippets of past
events all over the place.

11:39.651 --> 11:42.018
Some chick's [bleep] crying.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.320
She had a [bleep] fight with some guy.

11:44.405 --> 11:45.855
She's drinking...

11:45.957 --> 11:47.356
morphine.

11:47.442 --> 11:49.558
You know, somebody's who's in this room,

11:49.661 --> 11:51.193
they would hear her crying.

11:51.296 --> 11:54.297
They would hear the pacing, you know?

11:54.365 --> 11:57.616
They would feel like they're
having mental breakdowns.

12:04.709 --> 12:05.875
What's going on?

12:06.010 --> 12:09.795
Whatever is here makes
the living [bleep] insane.

12:09.881 --> 12:12.264
I don't even know how
anyone could stay here.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.350
There are just so many dead.

12:21.225 --> 12:22.190
So, how long you been here?

12:22.290 --> 12:23.423
Over seven years.

12:23.525 --> 12:26.046
Okay, so you were here before
Ian even bought the place?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.528
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.280
Any experiences you can't explain?

12:29.399 --> 12:30.782
When I was working graveyard,

12:30.900 --> 12:33.534
I would get up from my
desk and go do something,

12:33.636 --> 12:34.852
and then on my way back,

12:34.971 --> 12:37.772
I would see somebody
sitting in my chair.

12:37.857 --> 12:40.007
So I'd look again, and
they'd be gone, so...

12:40.093 --> 12:41.375
Now, you said you worked
the graveyard shift.

12:41.478 --> 12:42.810
Did you have the doors locked?

12:42.896 --> 12:45.646
Yes. I always locked the
doors for my protection.

12:45.732 --> 12:46.781
What about a guest?

12:46.916 --> 12:50.051
No. It was too fast
for it to be a person.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.452
Okay, so, anything else?

12:51.554 --> 12:52.820
I waitress now,

12:52.956 --> 12:56.224
and a few times, I would be
walking with the empty tray

12:56.309 --> 12:57.892
going to the dining room,

12:57.977 --> 13:02.146
and the tray just, with force,
was just thrown out of my hand.

13:02.232 --> 13:03.931
That's happened three times.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.783
So, where does this usually happen?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.368
Back here in the hallway.

13:07.470 --> 13:09.103
It happened more towards the kitchen.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.405
Did it feel like a hand
came up and smacked it or...

13:11.491 --> 13:13.674
Exactly. It felt like
somebody just went underneath

13:13.760 --> 13:15.810
and just popped it right out of my hand.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.395
Okay. That's interesting.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.080
It scared me.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.404
So, you've had a few
things. Anything else?

13:20.504 --> 13:23.755
Yes, I've taken three very
bad falls in this building

13:23.841 --> 13:25.640
since Ian has taken over.

13:25.742 --> 13:27.776
I fell out here in the lobby once

13:27.878 --> 13:30.145
with a wine glass in
my hand... cut my hand.

13:30.247 --> 13:32.853
Another time, I fell in the kitchen,

13:32.953 --> 13:34.489
and that was a hard fall.

13:34.589 --> 13:35.672
I really hurt my hand.

13:35.757 --> 13:37.223
I had bruises all over the place.

13:37.309 --> 13:39.292
And then another time, I slipped,

13:39.428 --> 13:42.762
and I went and told the cook,
I'm all, "This is dangerous.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.614
It's like ice there," you know?

13:44.733 --> 13:45.899
And he's testing it with his feet,

13:46.034 --> 13:48.968
and he said, "No, it's not.
It's not slippery at all."

13:49.070 --> 13:50.303
That's strange.

13:50.405 --> 13:52.789
These falls, now, is
this uncommon for you?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.507
I've only fallen in here.

13:54.593 --> 13:57.043
I don't usually fall. I'm not clumsy.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.645
I don't know if that's paranormal,

13:58.747 --> 14:00.747
but you've had stuff just
pop out of your hands.

14:00.849 --> 14:02.415
- Right.
- So it's not out of the realm

14:02.517 --> 14:04.701
that somebody may be trying
to make you fall, either.

14:04.820 --> 14:06.536
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

14:06.655 --> 14:07.787
Okay.

14:16.565 --> 14:19.833
This hallway is not a good place to be

14:19.935 --> 14:21.835
if you're a living person.

14:21.937 --> 14:24.587
These dead people who have
issues are running amok

14:24.673 --> 14:28.942
doing a lot of, like,
weird physical [bleep] here.

14:29.044 --> 14:31.144
This is not a good hallway to be in.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.079
It's very bad in here.

14:33.181 --> 14:34.214
Ohh.

14:36.968 --> 14:39.752
I feel sick, sick.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.641
Considering Ian's
owned the hotel for five years,

15:03.741 --> 15:05.574
he really doesn't know much about it.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.409
So I've reached out
to a local historian,

15:07.545 --> 15:08.861
who says it's actually a miracle

15:08.980 --> 15:10.279
that the Holbrooke's
still standing today.

15:17.759 --> 15:19.225
So, Hilary, do me a favor.

15:19.327 --> 15:21.527
Will you just start from the
beginning with this place?

15:21.662 --> 15:22.945
When was the hotel built?

15:23.030 --> 15:26.165
It was built in 1851, as
the Golden Gate Saloon.

15:26.267 --> 15:27.733
Did it flourish as a saloon?

15:27.835 --> 15:28.984
Yes, for several years...

15:29.103 --> 15:30.903
until the fire of 1855,

15:31.005 --> 15:32.621
where most of the town was burnt down.

15:32.707 --> 15:34.882
So, what kind of damage are
we talking about in this fire?

15:34.982 --> 15:36.348
- Over 60 acres.
- Wow!

15:36.433 --> 15:38.684
Over 300 buildings were destroyed,

15:38.819 --> 15:40.519
including the Golden Gate Saloon.

15:40.604 --> 15:42.788
Okay, so, obviously, they rebuilt.

15:42.890 --> 15:45.941
Yes. They rebuilt, and then
they added the lot next door,

15:46.060 --> 15:47.793
and they called it the Exchange Hotel.

15:47.878 --> 15:49.678
When did it become the Holbrooke Hotel?

15:49.763 --> 15:52.097
January 1, 1879.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.349
Daniel and his wife, Ellen, Holbrooke

15:54.435 --> 15:56.793
bought the hotel for $12,000.

15:56.893 --> 15:58.433
I have a photo of Daniel Holbrooke.

16:00.316 --> 16:01.482
They renovated it

16:01.567 --> 16:05.019
and reopened it as the Holbrooke.

16:05.121 --> 16:06.787
Nothing's really changed.

16:06.872 --> 16:09.473
No, that's the nice
thing about that hotel.

16:09.592 --> 16:11.742
So, now they have the hotel.
How's it work out for them?

16:11.827 --> 16:14.945
Unfortunately, four years
after they bought it,

16:15.064 --> 16:17.314
Daniel Holbrooke passes
away in the hotel.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.432
In the hotel?

16:18.534 --> 16:20.534
Yes, and here's a copy of his obituary.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.497
And they have his funeral at
the hotel a couple days later.

16:25.597 --> 16:27.330
What happens with the hotel?

16:27.874 --> 16:29.874
Well, Ellen takes it
over, and she runs it

16:29.959 --> 16:33.494
for the next 23 years
until her death in 1906.

16:33.613 --> 16:35.413
And I have a copy of her obituary here.

16:35.548 --> 16:37.582
She also dies in the hotel.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.887
Now, you mentioned on the
phone that it was a miracle

16:42.972 --> 16:44.333
that the Holbrooke was
even standing, still.

16:44.433 --> 16:45.449
What did you mean by that?

16:45.567 --> 16:47.467
Well, after that big fire of 1855,

16:47.553 --> 16:50.771
there were four more major fires
that devastated Grass Valley...

16:50.856 --> 16:53.907
one in 1860, 1862,

16:54.009 --> 16:57.044
1873, and 1896.

16:57.179 --> 16:59.896
But, somehow, the
Holbrooke was left standing.

17:00.015 --> 17:01.761
How close of a call
was it for the hotel?

17:01.861 --> 17:04.161
Well, in 1860 and 1873,

17:04.297 --> 17:07.031
everything within 100 feet
of the Holbrooke burned down.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.650
So, for some miraculous
reason, this survives.

17:09.769 --> 17:11.435
- Right.
- Okay.

17:18.010 --> 17:19.714
There were a lot of tragedies here,

17:20.519 --> 17:21.882
but then good stuff.

17:21.983 --> 17:25.675
Good things coming in waves.

17:25.775 --> 17:29.627
So, it's like good, good, good,
and then [bleep] decimation.

17:32.732 --> 17:36.067
You know, I'm seeing, like, buildings...

17:36.152 --> 17:37.735
I don't know, burning.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.571
The ground goes under, buckling.

17:40.673 --> 17:42.023
It's [bleep] chaos.

17:43.343 --> 17:44.375
Frankly, I don't know

17:44.477 --> 17:46.744
how there's still, like,
a [bleep] town here.

17:49.399 --> 17:53.818
So, you've got a hotel and bar
operating for over 150 years.

17:53.903 --> 17:56.220
I got to think there's
some violence there.

17:56.356 --> 17:58.055
I called the Grass Valley police chief,

17:58.141 --> 17:59.757
and he said some cases come to mind

17:59.892 --> 18:02.026
that will definitely
help my investigation.

18:10.553 --> 18:11.702
So, what were
you able to find out?

18:11.804 --> 18:14.372
Well, the first mysterious
death was a suicide.

18:14.507 --> 18:17.642
And that occurred April 17, 1927.

18:17.777 --> 18:20.211
And the gentleman's name
was John Henry Martin.

18:20.296 --> 18:21.979
He was a wealthy miner and a gambler.

18:22.065 --> 18:23.347
Okay.

18:23.433 --> 18:26.651
Martin was found here dead in
his hotel room at the Holbrooke.

18:26.736 --> 18:28.419
Do we know how this guy killed himself?

18:28.504 --> 18:30.955
Yes, he slashed his own throat.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.123
That's unusual.

18:32.258 --> 18:35.960
Yes. Here's a death certificate.

18:36.095 --> 18:37.962
I've been in the business for 34 years,

18:38.047 --> 18:41.455
and I've never experienced
anyone cutting their own throat.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.122
- I've seen it once.
- Yeah.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.960
Did we have any idea why he did it?

18:46.060 --> 18:50.396
No. But I do have a
suicide note that he left.

18:50.531 --> 18:54.366
In the note, he says he was
being shadowed and followed.

18:54.452 --> 18:56.285
That's strange. So,
it sounds like this guy

18:56.370 --> 18:58.604
might have been
hallucinating about something.

18:58.739 --> 19:00.022
That's what it appears.

19:00.107 --> 19:02.060
Okay. What else you come up with?

19:02.160 --> 19:04.610
The second one was 1909, and it involved

19:04.712 --> 19:10.082
a former bus driver of the
hotel named Cyrus McMath.

19:10.151 --> 19:11.817
- Okay.
- He was downstairs in the bar,

19:11.903 --> 19:14.019
drinking one night and very intoxicated,

19:14.105 --> 19:17.690
and he got into some kind
of beef with the owner.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.091
Frank DeMaine was his name.

19:19.193 --> 19:20.960
He was 76 years old. Here's his picture.

19:21.062 --> 19:23.529
Okay, so this guy's the owner
of the Holbrooke at the time.

19:23.614 --> 19:24.864
Correct.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.832
McMath starts beating DeMaine.

19:26.918 --> 19:31.985
And his son, Louis, is upstairs,
hears about this, comes down,

19:32.085 --> 19:36.771
and tries to protect his father,
and gets in a fight with McMath.

19:36.906 --> 19:40.262
Well, McMath loses,
and he gets pummeled.

19:40.362 --> 19:40.855
Really?

19:40.955 --> 19:44.423
Witnesses report they can't
even identify who McMath is

19:44.509 --> 19:47.660
because the injuries
make him unrecognizable.

19:47.762 --> 19:48.994
Okay, so what happens next?

19:49.130 --> 19:51.463
He's still conscious,
and he's taken home,

19:51.549 --> 19:54.683
but he dies shortly thereafter at home.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.525
I'm seeing, like, another guy.

20:01.389 --> 20:04.824
He's getting his face bashed in.

20:04.926 --> 20:08.851
I'm literally seeing men's boots,

20:08.951 --> 20:12.586
the bottom of their shoes,
coming down on my face.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.621
And that hurts.

20:14.724 --> 20:18.592
And then these two guys picked me up,

20:18.694 --> 20:20.900
and they're dragging me,
'cause I can't even walk.

20:23.094 --> 20:24.177
This is [bleep] up.

20:24.296 --> 20:25.512
This was creepy.

20:25.630 --> 20:28.946
I'm thinking, "Oh [bleep]
They're gonna [bleep] kill me."

20:35.373 --> 20:36.473
If you need us to investigate

20:36.575 --> 20:38.673
unexplained activity in your home,

20:38.773 --> 20:41.521
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

20:41.621 --> 20:43.838
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files" to submit you story,

20:43.974 --> 20:45.106
and we'll help if we can.

20:53.256 --> 20:54.338
So far, I've uncovered

20:54.474 --> 20:56.422
several deaths inside
my client's property

20:56.522 --> 20:57.655
and multiple fires

20:57.757 --> 21:00.608
that devastated the
city of Grass Valley.

21:00.726 --> 21:03.761
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.196
Searching through old records,

21:05.298 --> 21:08.571
I find an article about an
exotic dancer named Lola Montez.

21:08.671 --> 21:11.138
Turns out she brutally
beat a local newspaper man

21:11.240 --> 21:12.573
inside the hotel.

21:16.345 --> 21:18.262
I'm on my way to meet
with a local author

21:18.381 --> 21:20.548
who said Lola Montez traveled the world,

21:20.633 --> 21:23.184
and wherever she went,
violence followed her.

21:28.791 --> 21:29.657
So, Chris, you mentioned on the phone

21:29.759 --> 21:31.812
this Lola Montez was quite a character.

21:31.912 --> 21:34.023
But let me ask you a question.
Was she from Grass Valley?

21:34.123 --> 21:35.122
She was not.

21:35.207 --> 21:39.393
She was born in Ireland
between 1818 and 1821,

21:39.495 --> 21:41.245
and she was raised in India.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.997
She was quite beautiful
from a very young age.

21:44.100 --> 21:48.302
She becomes this great dancer by
the time she's 17, 18 years old,

21:48.387 --> 21:51.889
and starts to develop what we
know as the spider dance today.

21:51.974 --> 21:53.741
Okay, so, what the
hell is a spider dance?

21:53.826 --> 21:56.610
Part ballet, part interpretive dance,

21:56.712 --> 21:59.396
pretending as though she
was caught in a spider web.

21:59.515 --> 22:01.315
And as she's spun around,

22:01.417 --> 22:04.268
the opportunity to be
able to see some thigh

22:04.353 --> 22:07.438
or maybe the dress coming up a
little bit higher than the thigh

22:07.523 --> 22:09.356
was something that was very real

22:09.492 --> 22:11.230
and the audience thought was risque.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.581
And, certainly, men
would come to see this.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.835
Lola Montez's dance is so titillating

22:17.920 --> 22:20.304
that she gains the attention

22:20.439 --> 22:22.573
of King Ludwig of Bavaria.

22:22.658 --> 22:25.274
He takes her as his mistress.

22:25.374 --> 22:27.925
She takes over pretty much politically

22:28.060 --> 22:29.477
and kind of masterminds

22:29.595 --> 22:32.146
what he should be doing
within the government.

22:32.231 --> 22:33.881
And she's a young kid at this time.

22:33.966 --> 22:36.317
Right. Got a photo here of her.

22:36.402 --> 22:39.336
I mean, she was a stunning lady.

22:39.439 --> 22:41.672
So, how does she end up in Grass Valley?

22:41.757 --> 22:45.843
Well, after a relationship with
the king of Bavaria went bad,

22:45.945 --> 22:49.163
she left Europe and came to America

22:49.248 --> 22:51.048
and traveled around quite extensively,

22:51.134 --> 22:54.418
and ends up in the gold country,
because there's a lot of gold

22:54.487 --> 22:55.986
and a lot of money to be made here.

22:56.122 --> 22:58.238
All right, Chris. So, how does
she wind up at the Holbrooke

22:58.338 --> 22:59.371
giving this guy a beating?

22:59.456 --> 23:02.140
She performs at the Holbrooke.

23:02.276 --> 23:03.341
And Henry Shipley,

23:03.427 --> 23:05.777
who is a newspaperman
here in the gold country...

23:05.863 --> 23:06.845
Okay.

23:06.947 --> 23:08.847
And he has been reprinting articles

23:08.932 --> 23:12.317
that are very bad about Lola Montez.

23:12.402 --> 23:16.388
And so she trots on
down to the Holbrooke

23:16.490 --> 23:19.391
and takes a bull whip out

23:19.493 --> 23:22.227
and gives him four
lashes across the face.

23:22.312 --> 23:23.628
Wow. Okay.

23:23.714 --> 23:26.965
The beating made national news.

23:27.050 --> 23:28.667
All right, so, what
happens to this guy Shipley?

23:28.802 --> 23:32.244
He never does get over being
humiliated by Lola Montez.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.011
He ends up in Sacramento.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.947
He drinks himself to death, literally,

23:37.049 --> 23:40.751
because he downs a whole
bottle of strychnine.

23:40.886 --> 23:43.253
- Okay, so, he commits suicide.
- He does.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.922
So, what happened with Lola?

23:45.007 --> 23:48.842
Lola dies in 1861 in
New York in her late 30s,

23:48.961 --> 23:50.527
and she's impoverished.

23:55.234 --> 23:58.178
I'm seeing the woman who
rules with the iron fist again.

24:01.213 --> 24:02.162
Out there,

24:02.247 --> 24:05.582
she was very overwhelming
in her energy...

24:07.960 --> 24:11.412
like bigger-than-life
kind of person.

24:11.530 --> 24:13.464
It seems she's crying.

24:13.549 --> 24:17.868
Somebody says she was
tormenting herself.

24:17.953 --> 24:20.504
She's a mess.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.406
Obviously, something happened.

24:24.376 --> 24:25.759
There's a male.

24:25.878 --> 24:28.145
Oh, had to put her in her place.

24:28.247 --> 24:30.030
Too big for her britches.

24:30.116 --> 24:34.451
It was because she really
was, like, too powerful.

24:34.587 --> 24:39.289
People really, like, listened to her,

24:39.425 --> 24:42.626
and people respected her.

24:42.728 --> 24:44.661
There's something with
the right of her head.

24:44.764 --> 24:46.196
Man...

24:46.298 --> 24:47.898
Right side...

24:47.983 --> 24:51.034
Yeah, I think these guys
really [bleep] with her, man.

24:56.542 --> 24:58.504
I saw dozens of dead
people during my walk.

24:59.245 --> 25:01.562
But the group harassing
the living in the hallway

25:01.648 --> 25:03.214
had me the most concerned.

25:05.117 --> 25:09.419
There was a man on the left

25:09.521 --> 25:12.489
who was, like, climbing up the wall.

25:12.574 --> 25:15.359
And then there was
some crazy-looking woman

25:15.461 --> 25:18.195
standing in front of the door.

25:18.297 --> 25:22.666
Another guy was charging towards me.

25:26.305 --> 25:28.005
Amy, is this what you saw?

25:28.140 --> 25:29.940
Yes, this is what I saw.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.329
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:52.429 --> 25:54.162
we're ready to reveal our findings

25:54.247 --> 25:56.698
to each other and our
clients for the first time.

25:57.488 --> 26:00.422
Well, Amy, this is a very
special investigation.

26:00.508 --> 26:02.141
This hotel is the heart of the city,

26:02.260 --> 26:03.759
but because of the activity here,

26:03.895 --> 26:06.028
it's in danger of
shutting down for good.

26:06.113 --> 26:09.732
Now, for the past five years,
Ian has owned and run the hotel,

26:09.834 --> 26:11.500
but he can't go on like this.

26:11.602 --> 26:13.369
Terri has worked here for seven years.

26:13.504 --> 26:15.738
She's had a lot of experiences.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.908
The same with Kelly. She's a
local who used to work here,

26:19.010 --> 26:22.261
but she considers the
Holbrooke a home away from home.

26:22.380 --> 26:23.929
So, now that I told Amy

26:24.015 --> 26:26.498
just a little bit about
what's going on with you guys,

26:26.584 --> 26:28.751
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.790
When I got here,
I was seeing the town

26:33.875 --> 26:39.145
being decimated over
and over and over again,

26:39.264 --> 26:41.380
almost like it came in waves.

26:41.466 --> 26:45.501
And I saw people coming,
and that was good.

26:45.637 --> 26:48.671
Like, people were
excited. They're happy.

26:48.756 --> 26:50.339
It would be built up,

26:50.425 --> 26:54.277
and then it would just
be, like, decimated.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.846
And then there was fire.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.833
The ground was, like,
sinking or something.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.079
Well, it's probably a good time

27:02.179 --> 27:04.262
to give you a little
history about Grass Valley.

27:04.348 --> 27:07.649
In the mid-1800s, this town
was the heart of the gold rush,

27:07.734 --> 27:09.951
and people were coming
from all over the world

27:10.070 --> 27:11.786
looking for fortune.

27:11.905 --> 27:13.038
Now, in 1851,

27:13.123 --> 27:16.424
this place was opened up
as the Golden Gate Saloon.

27:16.543 --> 27:17.842
Now, just four years later,

27:17.928 --> 27:21.513
a huge fire ripped through this town.

27:21.648 --> 27:22.764
The building was burned to the ground.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.450
But when it was rebuilt,
it was rebuilt as the hotel.

27:25.535 --> 27:30.338
Now, in 1860, 1862, 1873,

27:30.424 --> 27:33.325
huge fires leveled this town again...

27:33.410 --> 27:34.876
destroying just about everything.

27:34.995 --> 27:36.044
Okay.

27:36.129 --> 27:37.245
Amazingly, though,

27:37.331 --> 27:40.298
the hotel survived each
of those other times.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.101
1879, a couple named Holbrooke

27:43.203 --> 27:46.538
brought the hotel and
named it after themselves.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.858
Now, I got a picture of it back then.

27:49.977 --> 27:52.410
1896, there was another fire,

27:52.496 --> 27:54.713
and the Holbrooke was
one of the only buildings

27:54.798 --> 27:57.399
- left standing again.
- Hmm.

27:57.517 --> 27:59.818
I didn't know about
all the fire history.

27:59.953 --> 28:02.687
It sounds like this hotel is a survivor,

28:02.773 --> 28:04.356
but there's something here.

28:07.361 --> 28:09.394
When I walked
in, I was overwhelmed.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.262
Obviously, there's a lot of dead here.

28:11.365 --> 28:12.597
Now, I'm on the main floor,

28:12.699 --> 28:15.967
and I went into the long peach hallway.

28:16.053 --> 28:18.620
That was probably not a good place

28:18.739 --> 28:20.708
for living people to be in...

28:20.808 --> 28:25.727
because there are a lot of
dead people in that hallway.

28:25.846 --> 28:27.279
Some of the other dead

28:27.364 --> 28:31.216
have put these different
dead people in there.

28:31.318 --> 28:34.987
The reason why they're
put in that hallway

28:35.072 --> 28:39.024
is because they're mentally unstable.

28:39.629 --> 28:41.312
So, let me get this straight.
The normal dead people

28:41.431 --> 28:44.332
are putting the nutty
dead people in a corner.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.467
- Yes.
- Wow.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.625
Because they're mentally unstable,

28:48.761 --> 28:51.845
the living might have
some experiences there,

28:51.964 --> 28:56.200
like seeing, perhaps,
like, dark shadows,

28:56.335 --> 29:00.604
feeling movement,
possibly feeling touched.

29:00.740 --> 29:05.042
When I was walking through the
hallway, I usually carry a tray.

29:05.127 --> 29:09.329
And the tray was knocked out of my hand.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.981
I had it up like this,

29:11.067 --> 29:16.336
and I felt as if somebody
just pushed it up,

29:16.455 --> 29:18.355
and it just toppled out of my hand.

29:18.441 --> 29:20.858
And that's happened to
me three times, so...

29:20.960 --> 29:21.630
Okay.

29:21.730 --> 29:24.681
And it's always been right
there in that hallway, so...

29:24.766 --> 29:26.532
You know where that hallway leads?

29:26.651 --> 29:28.584
That leads to my office.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.937
There's something
about the feeling there.

29:31.022 --> 29:32.855
When I first took the hotel over,

29:32.958 --> 29:36.159
within 48 hours,

29:36.261 --> 29:38.778
the ceiling collapsed in that office.

29:38.863 --> 29:40.196
That's kind of weird.

29:40.332 --> 29:41.664
And then now I'm wondering

29:41.750 --> 29:45.518
if there's something more going on.

29:45.637 --> 29:48.688
I did a sketch of what I saw.

29:56.348 --> 29:59.165
I mean, it looks like
a scene from a mental ward.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.136
Oh, my!

30:06.625 --> 30:07.958
I can't believe I have
to walk through that

30:08.043 --> 30:10.160
20 times a day.

30:14.349 --> 30:18.890
I can't believe that they
were here when I worked here.

30:23.124 --> 30:27.076
There's times when I feel anxious,

30:28.132 --> 30:29.882
like energy is being sucked out of me.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.316
That makes sense,

30:31.402 --> 30:34.954
because the other thing that I
got was a sense of extreme panic

30:35.054 --> 30:37.288
and feeling overwhelmed with anxiety.

30:37.373 --> 30:41.041
I've been being treated
for anxiety and depression.

30:41.127 --> 30:42.593
Mm.

30:47.733 --> 30:51.218
That's something that can
happen from being here.

30:51.337 --> 30:54.305
I have a huge investment
here, inside of me.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.639
It's a huge investment.

30:55.725 --> 30:57.641
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm.

30:57.727 --> 30:59.393
That's tough, yeah.

31:02.882 --> 31:03.848
Anything else?

31:03.933 --> 31:06.942
There was some other
weird guy, a dead guy.

31:07.042 --> 31:08.208
His name is Paul.

31:08.343 --> 31:10.493
And one of the places he likes a lot

31:10.579 --> 31:14.814
is the storage area in the kitchen.

31:14.950 --> 31:17.617
I think he might have had

31:17.702 --> 31:21.521
some mental illness, as well.

31:23.708 --> 31:26.993
He'll lash out and touch people.

31:27.078 --> 31:29.796
He'll take things. He'll hide things.

31:29.931 --> 31:34.817
<i>He would like to burn things
and/or has burned things.</i>

31:34.936 --> 31:36.736
And from what you were telling me,

31:36.821 --> 31:39.739
now I'm kind of concerned that
he's a little bit more dangerous

31:39.824 --> 31:44.093
than what I initially
assessed about him.

31:44.179 --> 31:49.032
His main goal is to
get rid of the living.

31:49.150 --> 31:50.984
I mean, the guy she's describing

31:51.119 --> 31:53.519
doesn't match up with anybody
I found in my research,

31:53.622 --> 31:54.971
but a lot of what you're saying

31:55.090 --> 31:58.091
matches up with what
they're experiencing.

31:58.176 --> 32:01.127
At first, I thought it was
just I was kind of losing it.

32:01.212 --> 32:03.530
I mean, honestly, it
doesn't make any sense.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.180
Stuff will go missing all the time.

32:06.266 --> 32:08.383
Now, you said
this guy can get physical.

32:08.501 --> 32:10.918
Terri, tell Amy about
the falls you've taken.

32:11.037 --> 32:12.987
Once was out here in the lobby,

32:13.106 --> 32:15.039
but in the kitchen both other times.

32:15.175 --> 32:16.541
Yeah, I was pretty bruised up.

32:16.626 --> 32:18.810
I still have pain from that fall.

32:20.981 --> 32:24.699
The next thing
that I saw was a female.

32:24.784 --> 32:27.735
And she was in charge here,

32:27.821 --> 32:32.156
and she ran this with,
like, an iron fist.

32:32.292 --> 32:36.327
In life, people listened to her,
and she was very influential.

32:36.413 --> 32:40.231
And men here did not like this.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.633
They wanted to put her in her place.

32:42.736 --> 32:45.703
There were a couple of
men, very specific men,

32:45.789 --> 32:48.322
one Hank and one Gerald,

32:48.408 --> 32:51.075
that really had big issues with her.

32:51.177 --> 32:55.313
There was a lot of pain in her head.

32:55.398 --> 32:57.648
I think that occasionally,

32:57.784 --> 33:02.820
she might look like a fawn apparition.

33:02.906 --> 33:04.322
And she tries to talk to people,

33:04.407 --> 33:06.257
and when she's trying to talk to them,

33:06.342 --> 33:09.477
they'll feel heat, and
they'll get very hot.

33:09.562 --> 33:12.413
So, Kelly, didn't you have
voices trying to talk to you?

33:12.532 --> 33:14.799
At the front desk.

33:14.884 --> 33:16.384
I've heard my name called,

33:16.503 --> 33:18.653
just walking through the
hall, and I hear my name.

33:18.738 --> 33:22.040
And I ask everybody who called
my name, but nobody knows.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.442
- That happens to you, too?
- Quite often.

33:24.527 --> 33:27.040
It may be a shot in the dark,
but a woman did come across

33:27.140 --> 33:30.541
in my research that could
possibly fit the bill,

33:30.677 --> 33:33.544
a woman by the name of Lola Montez.

33:33.630 --> 33:37.848
Now, she was probably one of
the most fascinating characters

33:37.984 --> 33:39.917
I've ever come across in my research.

33:40.003 --> 33:44.038
She was born in Ireland
between 1818 and maybe 1821.

33:44.157 --> 33:45.706
Nobody's really sure.

33:45.825 --> 33:48.142
By the time she was 16,
she was a famous dancer.

33:48.228 --> 33:50.611
She became very famous throughout Europe

33:50.730 --> 33:54.615
and had tons of
high-profile men after her.

33:54.734 --> 33:56.100
She wound up coming here to America

33:56.185 --> 33:58.870
and ended up dancing
here at the Holbrooke.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.637
Now, you mention a guy named Hank.

34:00.756 --> 34:05.792
Well, a guy named Henry
Shipley wrote articles about her

34:05.927 --> 34:09.329
in the local newspaper
that weren't very nice.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.130
She didn't take this too well.

34:11.233 --> 34:15.717
She came right here in
this saloon and whipped him.

34:15.804 --> 34:18.036
- Oh, goodness!
- I got an article here about it.

34:18.172 --> 34:22.425
Now, she caught him four times
across the face with this whip.

34:22.511 --> 34:25.344
Holy

34:25.414 --> 34:28.581
This guy was so embarrassed
by what happened to him

34:28.683 --> 34:31.150
that he eventually committed suicide.

34:31.286 --> 34:32.985
That's how embarrassed he was by it.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.821
Oh, wow! What...

34:34.922 --> 34:36.356
Wow.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.425
I've got a photo of her.

34:42.197 --> 34:44.931
Is it possible that might
be who you might have seen?

34:45.065 --> 34:47.266
Actually, yeah.

34:49.054 --> 34:52.105
I feel very connected to this person.

34:52.206 --> 34:53.273
I don't know.

34:53.375 --> 34:55.742
Maybe that's why this place
is my home away from home.

34:58.829 --> 35:00.180
So, what else?

35:01.410 --> 35:03.191
When I was upstairs,

35:03.291 --> 35:07.610
I encountered a lot
of residual information

35:07.695 --> 35:11.480
and a lot of different dead people.

35:11.616 --> 35:14.250
I went into one room, and I saw a male

35:14.335 --> 35:18.688
trying to strangle a
woman with his bare hands.

35:18.790 --> 35:22.206
And then I saw, unfortunately,
another woman in a room

35:22.306 --> 35:25.841
drinking some morphine.

35:25.927 --> 35:28.277
You know, finally, I just
kind of had to just stop,

35:28.413 --> 35:30.146
because it was just too much.

35:30.888 --> 35:35.441
Living people would go through,
possibly seeing some of the dead

35:35.559 --> 35:37.593
walking through their rooms at night.

35:37.728 --> 35:40.262
Also, people might feel really dizzy.

35:40.348 --> 35:43.532
I was getting that consistently
through the building.

35:43.634 --> 35:47.736
And some people, obviously,
might have physical experiences.

35:48.411 --> 35:48.923
So, Amy, obviously,

35:49.023 --> 35:50.872
we're getting to the
heart of why we're here,

35:50.958 --> 35:52.207
and the problem with the hotel.

35:52.326 --> 35:54.276
The upstairs is obviously
where the guests stay.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.744
Yeah, one gentleman

35:55.863 --> 35:58.930
was in room number 3, laying in his bed,

35:59.066 --> 36:01.516
and he said just, suddenly,

36:01.602 --> 36:03.235
there's a whirlwind...

36:03.320 --> 36:06.405
with all the windows
closed, doors closed.

36:06.490 --> 36:09.207
He came down here. He
was white as a ghost.

36:09.309 --> 36:13.595
He said, "I'm leaving. This
place has got problems."

36:13.681 --> 36:16.715
I spoke to one of the employees
who saw a kid run out of here.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.134
It turned out the kid felt
like he was being massaged

36:19.219 --> 36:22.204
by something on the bed,
which was kind of freaky.

36:22.289 --> 36:23.255
Wow.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.924
This place is pretty damn active.

36:26.009 --> 36:29.194
How would being around all
these dead people in this place

36:29.296 --> 36:30.996
affect somebody like Ian and Terri

36:31.131 --> 36:32.414
that are here all the time?

36:32.533 --> 36:35.500
That exposure over a long period of time

36:35.602 --> 36:39.337
would cause some...

36:39.423 --> 36:43.008
emotional and mental
disorders to develop.

36:43.110 --> 36:45.627
Employees could suffer breakdowns,

36:45.713 --> 36:50.118
and then some physically
could be harmed.

36:50.995 --> 36:52.328
Not good.

36:52.413 --> 36:54.206
You told me you thought this
place destroyed your marriage.

36:54.306 --> 36:55.839
I think it had a big, big hand...

36:55.941 --> 36:56.907
Hmm.

36:57.857 --> 37:00.625
In my breakup of my marriage.

37:00.710 --> 37:02.176
It's changed my personality.

37:02.295 --> 37:05.966
It came down to a point where
I was very short-tempered.

37:06.066 --> 37:09.234
I had a relationship with
someone who worked here,

37:09.319 --> 37:12.270
and...

37:12.355 --> 37:13.721
he changed.

37:13.807 --> 37:17.158
The relationship went to crap.

37:17.244 --> 37:19.193
Does what they're
saying make sense to you?

37:19.279 --> 37:21.646
Yeah.

37:21.731 --> 37:24.866
I've done a lot of hotels.

37:24.985 --> 37:30.421
Maybe 5% are as active as this.

37:30.523 --> 37:33.625
I don't want you to lose your sanity,

37:33.760 --> 37:34.959
and I don't want to lose mine,

37:35.095 --> 37:37.609
but I think that if we
give up on the Holbrooke,

37:37.709 --> 37:39.825
then we'll be giving
up on the entire town.

37:56.516 --> 37:57.605
So, Ian, now we know

37:57.705 --> 38:00.681
why your employees have been
so scared to be here alone.

38:00.781 --> 38:01.981
We know why your guests

38:02.116 --> 38:03.849
have been checking out
in the middle of the night

38:03.934 --> 38:06.085
and why your relationships
are falling apart.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.369
But we still don't know

38:07.455 --> 38:10.990
if you can safely keep
the Holbrooke's doors open.

38:11.075 --> 38:15.227
So, for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:15.329 --> 38:18.414
Sometimes, there are places

38:18.499 --> 38:22.067
that are just

38:22.169 --> 38:25.938
so extremely active

38:26.040 --> 38:29.575
that, literally, it would take

38:29.710 --> 38:34.730
a town of various practitioners

38:34.849 --> 38:37.966
and many years

38:38.052 --> 38:43.989
to completely cleanse
and remove the dead

38:44.091 --> 38:46.542
and the residual energy.

38:46.660 --> 38:50.129
This is one of those places.

38:50.231 --> 38:54.099
And I know it's not really
what y'all want to hear.

38:54.185 --> 38:55.734
It sounds like you're saying

38:55.836 --> 38:57.469
they can't get rid of the dead here.

38:57.571 --> 39:01.256
Frankly, it would take, really, years.

39:04.945 --> 39:06.745
That's not at all what I expected,

39:06.881 --> 39:08.013
to be honest with you.

39:08.115 --> 39:13.018
No. Not at all what I expected to hear.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.536
Here's the thing.

39:14.622 --> 39:17.723
Typically, what ends up happening

39:17.858 --> 39:19.658
to these kinds of places

39:19.744 --> 39:23.529
is that, kind of, the
dead win in the end.

39:23.614 --> 39:26.682
Most of the locations
that have been like this

39:26.801 --> 39:29.952
either end up getting torn down,

39:30.071 --> 39:31.737
or they sit vacant.

39:31.872 --> 39:35.340
They're, like, literally
run out of business.

39:35.443 --> 39:37.443
Yeah, I mean, that's just not an option.

39:37.528 --> 39:39.161
I got to come up with something.

39:39.246 --> 39:41.013
I got to keep this place open.

39:41.148 --> 39:43.048
It actually is kind
of breaking my heart.

39:43.184 --> 39:46.435
She's like another one of my kids.

39:46.554 --> 39:51.023
I have never felt as strong
about a place in my life.

39:51.108 --> 39:52.291
That's horrible.

39:52.393 --> 39:54.510
I mean, I've got to come
up with an option here

39:54.595 --> 39:57.229
to make this place
successful for the town.

39:57.364 --> 39:59.665
If this were my
place, I would leave,

39:59.750 --> 40:03.685
because there's nothing you
can do to make it totally safe.

40:03.804 --> 40:05.971
But if you're really determined to stay,

40:06.056 --> 40:09.808
there are things that you can do

40:09.910 --> 40:13.579
to protect yourselves.

40:13.664 --> 40:16.298
Here's a bag of black salt.

40:16.383 --> 40:17.749
Take some of this,

40:17.835 --> 40:20.786
sprinkle it in approximately
the four corners of the building.

40:20.888 --> 40:22.838
And what that's gonna do is just kind of

40:22.923 --> 40:26.859
build an energetic wall of purity

40:26.944 --> 40:31.380
to keep the dead out.

40:31.465 --> 40:35.934
The other thing is is to utilize stones.

40:36.020 --> 40:39.054
Okay, we have black tourmaline,
and we have selenite.

40:39.140 --> 40:42.057
It protects you
specifically from the dead.

40:42.176 --> 40:44.426
You would carry those stones all day.

40:44.545 --> 40:45.677
Here's the problem.

40:45.763 --> 40:48.147
None of them are long-lasting,

40:48.232 --> 40:52.467
so this would be a daily type of ritual.

40:52.586 --> 40:53.952
So, what are you gonna do?

40:54.088 --> 40:55.988
Well, I'm gonna take
precautions, to start with.

40:56.123 --> 40:57.422
I'm not gonna give up.

40:57.525 --> 41:01.894
My concern is for the living here

41:01.979 --> 41:06.031
who are consistently here
and your mental well-being,

41:06.133 --> 41:09.568
because I've seen people,

41:09.653 --> 41:11.770
you know, undertake tasks like this

41:11.856 --> 41:16.241
and kind of self-destruct.

41:16.343 --> 41:18.377
Instead of the building being torn down,

41:18.479 --> 41:21.029
<i>you might be torn down.</i>

41:21.148 --> 41:24.333
This place being boarded
up would be a travesty.

41:24.433 --> 41:27.234
I'm gonna give it a
good, good try, anyway,

41:27.336 --> 41:29.253
- the old college try.
- Yeah. Good.

41:31.874 --> 41:34.108
I wish I had better news for Ian.

41:34.210 --> 41:38.144
The dead inside this hotel would
literally take years to remove.

41:38.169 --> 41:40.126
But with the precautions I gave him,

41:40.226 --> 41:42.006
Ian will at least have
a fighting chance

41:42.106 --> 41:44.191
of keeping the doors
of his hotel open.
