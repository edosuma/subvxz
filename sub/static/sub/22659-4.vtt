00:48.792 --> 00:50.185
What's the fuck?!

00:52.886 --> 00:53.873
Easy, cowboy.

00:57.548 --> 00:58.244
*

00:58.245 --> 01:00.161
- Hello, Frank.
- Can you hold on a minute?

01:04.560 --> 01:06.747
- Hm, that's not safe.
- What's not safe?

01:06.902 --> 01:08.430
Some inappropriate driving.

01:08.670 --> 01:12.598
You see, Frank? That's why I can't ever trust you... with Sophie.

01:13.082 --> 01:13.817
Sophie?

01:13.818 --> 01:16.895
Sophie, yeah. That's what I'm calling the new car.

01:17.359 --> 01:19.759
I don't like it. It's not a pet, Dieter.

01:23.836 --> 01:26.119
I don't understand why you won't just let me drive the car.

01:26.331 --> 01:28.034
It will need negotiating.

01:28.287 --> 01:29.655
Well, that means you need a favour.

01:29.907 --> 01:31.243
No, I need a suit.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.728
Go to that place downtown by the waterfront.

01:33.845 --> 01:35.916
Take my credit card.  I'm busy.

01:36.428 --> 01:37.860
Yeah. Always busy.

01:38.838 --> 01:39.960
Sophie.

01:56.656 --> 01:57.836
Give it to me.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.172
Sorry, babe.

02:31.927 --> 02:32.779
Gotta go.

02:40.073 --> 02:43.673
Time to ditch this tailing piece of tail.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.143
Dude can drive. No doubt.

03:20.357 --> 03:21.654
You need anything else?

03:22.370 --> 03:24.171
That's all. Thank you.

05:06.612 --> 05:07.576
*

05:11.261 --> 05:12.388
You're late.

05:12.485 --> 05:13.917
Just give me the address.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.067
Next left.

05:18.692 --> 05:19.776
Shit!

05:19.872 --> 05:20.685
What?

05:20.831 --> 05:21.768
What happened?

05:22.116 --> 05:23.665
My shirt. It's ruined.

05:24.111 --> 05:26.782
Whatever. You've got 90 seconds to the pickup.

05:27.324 --> 05:29.322
I can't meet the client with a dirty shirt.

05:29.554 --> 05:31.445
You're 100 meters from the pickup.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.534
Bye, Carla.

05:35.753 --> 05:36.837
Jesus.

05:38.703 --> 05:40.145
Rule Number 5, Frank.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.857
No coffee in the car.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.435
Now who's late?

06:25.364 --> 06:27.493
Rule 1, people. Rule Number 1.

06:30.493 --> 06:31.906
The drop's late.

06:31.907 --> 06:33.803
Patience is a virtue, Frank.

06:34.422 --> 06:35.985
They're still late.

06:36.410 --> 06:38.152
Better than being really late.

06:38.462 --> 06:40.204
I'll give them 30 seconds.

06:40.862 --> 06:43.532
Come on, you need to be more flexible.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.874
They're Americans, they're late.

06:47.782 --> 06:48.924
Drop the phone.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.595
Nice and easy. No sudden moves.

07:07.088 --> 07:08.218
Hands in the air.

07:09.689 --> 07:10.850
Turn around.

07:14.837 --> 07:16.134
Jack Perkins.

07:16.928 --> 07:18.428
What the hell are you doing here?

07:19.424 --> 07:20.402
Surprise.

07:20.886 --> 07:22.434
I'm the package.

07:23.518 --> 07:24.795
Oh, no.

07:25.627 --> 07:27.369
You're the reason I'm in the US?

07:27.563 --> 07:29.653
No way. Absolutely not.

07:30.369 --> 07:32.033
I made it worth your while.

07:32.498 --> 07:34.511
It's not about the money, Jack. It's the rules.

07:34.589 --> 07:38.306
Fuck the rules, Frank. The wrong people find out I'm back, I'm dead.

07:39.196 --> 07:40.841
Was the gun really necessary?

07:41.209 --> 07:42.273
Precautions.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.789
You never woulda got the drop if these were still workin' right.

07:47.790 --> 07:48.525
What?

07:48.622 --> 07:50.480
Photoreceptors in my eyes.

07:50.828 --> 07:51.583
Done.

07:51.699 --> 07:53.074
You don't fight any different.

07:53.499 --> 07:55.454
I still think I'm gonna win.

07:55.628 --> 07:56.732
Ha-ha-ha.

07:57.351 --> 08:02.481
Yeah, I remember thatfrom that close-combat training course you, uh... ran for us.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.359
Why you're still in one piece.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.371
Not the only reason.

08:07.301 --> 08:09.836
I would never have got out of that village if you hadn't come back for me.

08:09.913 --> 08:11.617
You think I would have just left you there?

08:13.844 --> 08:14.495
So...

08:15.904 --> 08:17.313
you just gonna leave me here?

08:22.082 --> 08:23.921
You can't smoke in the car.

08:24.811 --> 08:27.453
What, you think I'm crazy? Smoking'll kill you.

08:27.859 --> 08:30.849
This'll kill you quicker. Take it easy with it, will you?

08:40.808 --> 08:42.259
We need to turn off your cell...

08:43.381 --> 08:44.852
and your GPS...

08:45.259 --> 08:48.429
any other tracking devices. Only land lines from here on out.

08:48.707 --> 08:50.813
I'm not getting involved in agency bullshit.

08:51.289 --> 08:53.593
Frank, you're the only one I can trust.

08:54.424 --> 08:56.283
If I could drive myself, I would.

08:57.637 --> 08:58.586
Please.

09:00.231 --> 09:01.199
Where to?

09:02.192 --> 09:03.115
George Street.

09:03.386 --> 09:04.605
And where would that be?

09:04.780 --> 09:06.018
I'll tell you where to go.

09:08.952 --> 09:10.829
The blind leading the blind.

09:11.217 --> 09:11.991
Yeah.

09:25.985 --> 09:27.456
*

09:35.915 --> 09:36.961
What are we doing?

09:37.561 --> 09:40.890
Best Philly cheesesteak in the world. I just want a couple to go.

09:41.239 --> 09:42.593
You're not eating in the car.

09:44.141 --> 09:45.650
Fine. We'll eat in here then.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.676
When I was working outta Langley... I'd come down here 2, 3 times a week.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.482
When Laura wasn't in school, I'd bring her with me.

09:59.421 --> 10:01.415
That's the hardest part about being in the field.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.834
Having to leave her behind.

10:04.977 --> 10:06.138
She had a kid.

10:06.487 --> 10:08.054
Frank, I'm a grandpa.

10:08.558 --> 10:10.222
Never even seen his face.

10:11.829 --> 10:13.357
Nearly 7 years old.

10:14.751 --> 10:16.009
Never heard his voice.

10:18.060 --> 10:19.260
It's time to come home.

10:21.835 --> 10:24.197
You couldn't just have Laura pick you up at the airport?

10:25.532 --> 10:26.694
Complications.

10:27.371 --> 10:29.055
With the CIA? You're kidding.

10:30.932 --> 10:32.480
You're sure no one knows you're back?

10:32.655 --> 10:33.564
I hope not.

10:35.739 --> 10:37.016
I said no phones.

10:37.306 --> 10:38.337
It's a burner.

10:39.383 --> 10:40.235
Dieter.

10:40.672 --> 10:44.725
Frank, if the invitation says "black tie," can I wear a black tie with blue jeans?

10:44.899 --> 10:46.099
Is this an emergency, Dieter?

10:46.177 --> 10:47.590
Yes, it's my sister's wedding.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.466
I can't talk about this now.

10:49.659 --> 10:51.149
Do you want to drive Sophie?

10:51.362 --> 10:53.683
Don't give the cars names, Dieter. Where are you?

10:53.684 --> 10:57.945
I'm at a very expensive men's clothing store in town and the guy was so rude to me...

10:57.983 --> 11:00.768
I had to go out before I smacked him in the mouth.

11:01.155 --> 11:02.064
Go back in.

11:02.065 --> 11:02.858
Back?

11:02.994 --> 11:04.097
Talk to the girls.

11:04.155 --> 11:05.239
There are girls?

11:05.819 --> 11:07.116
Yes. It'll be better.

11:07.194 --> 11:08.955
Uh, girls are better. That's right, Frank.

11:09.032 --> 11:10.310
Okay, uh... thank you.

11:16.716 --> 11:18.313
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

11:19.256 --> 11:20.418
What could go wrong?

11:31.063 --> 11:32.829
Someone didn't like their sandwich!

11:37.886 --> 11:40.039
Maybe their beef is with someone specific!

11:40.040 --> 11:43.500
Beef? You making a sandwich joke? That's good. Stay positive.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.163
Step up.

11:48.472 --> 11:49.343
Step down.

11:49.730 --> 11:50.485
Stop.

11:52.443 --> 11:53.333
How many?

11:53.469 --> 11:54.127
3.

11:54.649 --> 11:55.636
1 more.

11:55.849 --> 11:56.720
Behind them.

11:56.755 --> 11:59.039
Street level. Firing from a car. No echo.

12:01.884 --> 12:03.665
Could you put that away? Someone could get hurt.

12:03.666 --> 12:05.155
That would be the idea.

12:09.836 --> 12:10.959
Jesus.

12:12.549 --> 12:13.343
Lucky.

12:13.344 --> 12:14.968
Ha! Says you.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.239
If you listen, everything stands still.

12:17.568 --> 12:18.401
Listen...

12:18.730 --> 12:19.775
for breathing...

12:20.800 --> 12:24.512
clothes rustling, footsteps. Even a man's thoughts... carry sound.

12:25.132 --> 12:26.352
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

12:26.353 --> 12:29.255
Loud and clear, Frank. It's time to kick some ass.

12:45.669 --> 12:47.333
- Tie. Tie!
- Frank!

13:23.129 --> 13:24.039
What's the deal?

13:29.316 --> 13:31.465
Some shit went down in Eastern Europe.

13:32.713 --> 13:35.597
A network was exposed, a bunch of agents ended up dead.

13:35.736 --> 13:36.510
Blown?

13:36.582 --> 13:37.685
I thought so.

13:37.781 --> 13:41.186
Only a handful of people knew about the program, they were all Stateside.

13:43.317 --> 13:44.826
I ask a few questions.

13:45.118 --> 13:46.453
I get no answers.

13:47.014 --> 13:48.369
But you keep digging.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.248
These guys were my friends, Frank.

13:50.499 --> 13:53.248
I ate in their homes, I met the kids.

13:53.519 --> 13:54.874
I couldn't just walk away.

13:57.215 --> 14:00.137
Turned out every so-called blind e-drop...

14:00.486 --> 14:04.879
that I used for the last 3 years was duplicated to a site in Panama.

14:05.689 --> 14:07.198
Someone was stalking you.

14:08.433 --> 14:15.518
My guy in South America sniffs it out, turns up a data dump with a shitload of information no one's supposed to have.

14:15.711 --> 14:17.472
At least, not in the same place.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.174
Don't tell me you copied that data.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.219
I had to.

14:21.877 --> 14:23.832
2 days after I find this out...

14:24.138 --> 14:27.370
my place in Prague catches on fire. I'm not there.

14:27.642 --> 14:30.797
A friend of mine is. He goes running out, gets shot.

14:31.088 --> 14:33.526
Witness said it was by a guy in a green Volvo.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.455
Next day... the NY handlers call me in.

14:37.688 --> 14:40.824
I'm going to the meet. Guess who's waiting for me.

14:41.365 --> 14:42.546
Green Volvo.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.101
I'm being set up, Frank.

14:48.073 --> 14:50.879
So look like you blew the European operation.

14:51.692 --> 14:54.383
But... I have that data.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.427
Secure master codes, NSA Comsat matrixes...

14:58.777 --> 15:00.945
NATO tactical scenarios.

15:00.999 --> 15:04.464
It's a whole heap of shit that's not supposed to be floating around.

15:04.735 --> 15:06.032
That's the package.

15:10.247 --> 15:13.073
Did you contact anyone at the CIA before you came home?

15:13.640 --> 15:16.601
I reached out to 1 person, an old friend.

15:19.709 --> 15:20.987
You're not safe, Jack.

15:21.819 --> 15:23.716
Pff! Why d'you think I hired you?

15:30.155 --> 15:31.162
Where're we going?

15:31.413 --> 15:32.730
Hartford, Connecticut.

15:48.605 --> 15:51.644
*

15:56.721 --> 15:57.998
I need answers from you.

15:58.712 --> 16:01.983
Agent-involved shooting last night. Philadelphia. Thoughts?

16:02.272 --> 16:03.608
It was all over the news.

16:04.576 --> 16:05.834
How do we know it's agency?

16:06.898 --> 16:10.091
We know it's agency because it's Jack fuckin' Perkins.

16:10.323 --> 16:12.123
Surveillance tapes at the shop.

16:13.805 --> 16:15.257
I thought he was in Europe.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.740
The op went bad, Smith.

16:18.798 --> 16:19.746
What happened?

16:20.540 --> 16:21.740
Nothing good.

16:22.127 --> 16:23.288
But he's here.

16:25.337 --> 16:27.040
He's partnered up with this guy.

16:27.815 --> 16:28.860
Any hits?

16:29.286 --> 16:30.196
Nothing yet.

16:30.350 --> 16:33.896
But Mr. Suit and Tie's a pro. Fake plates, but he shouldn't be hard to find.

16:34.051 --> 16:35.735
Perkins hired him because he's running.

16:37.051 --> 16:38.135
From what?

16:38.812 --> 16:40.999
The question I want answered is to where.

16:41.670 --> 16:43.064
And you want me to find him?

16:43.987 --> 16:47.200
Why else would you I call you here? And, what are you still doing here?

16:48.787 --> 16:49.929
And Smith.

16:51.013 --> 16:53.336
Keep your gun in your pants. I want him alive.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.536
Excuse me?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.633
- Can you help me?
- I don't work here.

17:08.933 --> 17:10.075
Eww.

17:20.175 --> 17:21.278
Hello.

17:21.424 --> 17:22.101
Hi.

17:22.102 --> 17:23.553
Hi. May I help you?

17:23.571 --> 17:26.347
Yes. I want a black--

17:26.348 --> 17:28.839
- Would you prefer I speak English?
- That would be great, yeah.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.428
Uh... I'm looking for some stuff for a black tie.

17:31.501 --> 17:34.089
Hm. What were you thinking of?

17:34.694 --> 17:38.348
I don't know. Some stuff... black tie, or... pants or...

17:40.179 --> 17:40.915
Ah.

17:43.934 --> 17:45.504
I think I have just what you need.

17:45.601 --> 17:46.375
Yup.

17:46.704 --> 17:48.524
I was thinking the same thing.

18:00.150 --> 18:01.679
Uh, we got a hit on the car.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.795
Just be careful.

18:02.989 --> 18:03.918
Seriously?

18:04.153 --> 18:06.185
How hard can it be to pick up some blind dude?

18:06.319 --> 18:09.919
Jack Perkins was the agency's top field man, fucknuts.

18:10.310 --> 18:12.923
If he doesn't want to be brought in, you're gonna die trying.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.800
Why isn't the NSA handling this?

18:14.974 --> 18:16.600
We're keeping this one in-house.

18:16.601 --> 18:18.729
But Xavier was running Perkins though, right?

18:18.787 --> 18:21.690
All East European ops. Why?

18:21.823 --> 18:23.894
Mm-mm. Just heard things.

18:24.936 --> 18:27.278
Perkins landed in the shit because of her, right?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.136
Is this a straight-up hit?

18:30.426 --> 18:32.690
She wants him alive, Okay?

18:33.237 --> 18:34.553
Then why send us?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.602
Alive, fucknuts!

18:45.510 --> 18:47.194
*

19:00.820 --> 19:02.833
Jack, stay where I can see you.

19:02.834 --> 19:03.956
Fine.

19:19.452 --> 19:21.523
- It's a very good look for you.
- Yeah.

19:21.524 --> 19:22.701
Distinctive.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.101
I have to call my friend.

19:25.212 --> 19:27.302
So I already know what I'm going to wear?

19:33.131 --> 19:34.002
There you go.

19:34.738 --> 19:35.821
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:43.623 --> 19:44.997
Did you get what you wanted?

19:45.577 --> 19:47.164
I got the outfit, I think.

19:47.292 --> 19:49.015
And a date for the wedding.

19:49.150 --> 19:50.041
A date?

19:50.737 --> 19:53.369
Well. Well done, Dieter. What are you wearing?

19:53.403 --> 19:54.816
I-I wear snakeskin.

19:54.817 --> 19:55.552
What?

19:56.713 --> 19:57.545
No.

19:57.546 --> 19:58.590
It's cool.

19:59.976 --> 20:02.241
No, hot. It-it's hot. Not cool.

20:03.712 --> 20:04.931
Send me a picture.

20:05.124 --> 20:06.228
Okay. Just wait.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.940
- We'll have a picture.
- Okay.

20:08.192 --> 20:09.005
So.

20:10.631 --> 20:11.501
Wha--

20:13.741 --> 20:16.799
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:16.895 --> 20:17.534
No.

20:17.891 --> 20:18.859
Why not?

20:18.937 --> 20:21.724
Because, no. Tell the girl you need a black suit.

20:21.956 --> 20:23.814
But she says it looks boring.

20:23.910 --> 20:26.523
Your sister will kill you, and then she'll kill me...

20:26.562 --> 20:29.310
if you show up wearing snakeskin pants.

20:29.939 --> 20:31.565
Okay. Thank you, Frank.

20:34.632 --> 20:37.342
Okay, listen, my friend says... it's not right.

20:37.389 --> 20:39.440
I-I love it, but, um...

20:39.847 --> 20:42.595
will you help me to find just... a normal suit...

20:42.596 --> 20:43.892
not too expensive?

20:45.504 --> 20:49.588
Sure. I will... get someone to help you with a suit.

20:59.750 --> 21:00.668
What are we doing?

21:01.365 --> 21:02.777
We're not doing anything.

21:02.778 --> 21:04.694
I want to see if we're on anyone's radar.

21:05.023 --> 21:07.211
Hunting the hunters. I like that.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.314
Here's the deal.

21:08.333 --> 21:13.365
You want me to drive you to the package, you do what I say, when I say, how I say.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.495
- Deal?
- Deal.

21:32.855 --> 21:33.533
Hey!

21:37.226 --> 21:38.852
Footsteps on the pavement.

22:57.636 --> 22:58.391
Clear.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.769
Jesus Christ!

24:03.272 --> 24:05.110
Tell the maid we had to leave early.

24:06.291 --> 24:07.065
Come on.

24:14.653 --> 24:16.511
I need you to stick to the rules.

24:17.246 --> 24:19.162
The rules need to bend, Frank.

24:19.432 --> 24:21.716
We need to be flexible. Be like the willow branch.

24:21.736 --> 24:24.039
Please. Please, please, don't.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.763
The guy in the bathroom, what'd he look like?

24:32.446 --> 24:36.099
Black, well built, sunglasses. Chews on a toothpick.

24:37.192 --> 24:38.876
I know 'im. Merck.

24:39.137 --> 24:40.666
Wannabe spyboy.

24:41.150 --> 24:42.446
Works for Xavier.

24:42.627 --> 24:43.672
Xavier?

24:43.749 --> 24:45.123
The one I reached out to.

24:45.438 --> 24:48.651
The one who betrayed you? And is behind the Panama site?

24:56.323 --> 24:57.910
He'll be headed for the drop.

24:57.916 --> 24:59.057
The one by the river?

24:59.212 --> 25:00.703
No, the one he's always used.

25:00.761 --> 25:02.251
He's putting up a hell of a fight.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.346
You're authorized to use whatever force necessary.

25:06.347 --> 25:07.314
Understood.

25:35.976 --> 25:37.621
This is what we call a "dead drop."

25:38.221 --> 25:39.054
What are you doing?

25:40.912 --> 25:41.899
Great, huh?

25:42.983 --> 25:44.473
I mean, who would think to look here?

25:44.899 --> 25:45.983
So, you got it?

25:52.629 --> 25:55.242
I can't come back. I'm fucked without the drive.

25:55.243 --> 25:56.461
Well, where is it, Jack?

25:58.319 --> 25:59.887
The drive, please.

25:59.964 --> 26:01.261
I'm sorry, but we don't have it.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.171
Now I'll kill you.

26:05.267 --> 26:06.932
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Rolf.

26:07.435 --> 26:08.345
Is that you?

26:08.722 --> 26:11.025
Listen, he's just the driver. Leave him out of it.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.787
Rolf? You know this guy, Jack?

26:12.883 --> 26:14.683
Yeah, I shot him in the Sudan, once.

26:14.780 --> 26:15.806
Sudan?

26:16.193 --> 26:17.316
That must've hurt.

26:18.922 --> 26:19.773
Rolf...

26:21.631 --> 26:23.664
somebody at the agency did tell you I'm back?

26:24.196 --> 26:25.570
I got a call.

26:25.745 --> 26:28.783
A chance to kill the great Jack Perkins.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.784
You couldn't handle the great Jack Perkins.

26:32.345 --> 26:34.377
Heh-heh-heh-heh, huh.

26:35.132 --> 26:37.571
You remember that rigged taxi in Istanbul?

26:37.572 --> 26:39.062
Frank, you should've seen it.

26:39.236 --> 26:42.990
This Einstein... sets a trap, sends his own guys into it.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.602
Blows his brother's head clean off the shoulders.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.286
Kill this blind piece of crap!

26:55.081 --> 26:56.184
Jack, behind you.

27:04.677 --> 27:05.548
Frank!

27:37.677 --> 27:39.168
The Phoenix Claw?

27:39.920 --> 27:43.423
Frank, I didn't know you were paying attention when I taught that. Nice.

27:47.382 --> 27:49.453
10 degrees. A little more, Jack.

27:59.747 --> 28:00.947
How do you do that?

28:01.838 --> 28:02.941
First, you listen.

28:03.096 --> 28:04.489
No, not this again.

28:04.603 --> 28:05.667
Second...

28:06.461 --> 28:09.635
even a nearly blind man can see a bright orange sweater.

28:12.519 --> 28:15.926
The urn was attached to the plate. Broke off when Rolf hit it.

28:20.157 --> 28:20.989
What?

28:23.195 --> 28:24.415
This is it!

28:25.088 --> 28:26.598
This is the drive!

28:26.637 --> 28:30.372
You-- He put it in the urn! This is hysterical.

28:30.411 --> 28:32.830
Hysterical, yeah. Think we should get out of here?

28:33.411 --> 28:34.185
Come on.

28:41.053 --> 28:45.078
So now we're at war with the CIA. Any thoughts as to next steps?

28:46.357 --> 28:50.150
No. War's a little... strong. I'd call it a skirmish.

28:51.582 --> 28:54.098
Whatever you want to call it, I'll be happier when this is over.

28:54.741 --> 28:57.721
What are you so gloomy about? We've got the drive.

28:57.763 --> 28:59.079
Well, what good's that going to do us?

28:59.215 --> 29:01.344
It proves I'm not the mole.

29:01.576 --> 29:04.982
Backtrace the file routes, you find out who is. I'm off the hook.

29:05.117 --> 29:08.350
Whoever sent those clowns back there wants you dead either way, Jack.

29:08.427 --> 29:09.840
You're on the hook more than ever.

29:11.679 --> 29:13.653
That's why we have to get this to the right people.

29:14.192 --> 29:15.353
And they would be?

29:18.534 --> 29:20.566
Great. Just what I thought.

29:20.702 --> 29:22.095
You have no idea.

29:28.505 --> 29:29.434
What is it?

29:35.090 --> 29:35.922
Shit!

29:44.338 --> 29:45.112
M-16?

29:45.190 --> 29:48.441
I don't know, could be an M240. I'll pull up and ask.

30:27.893 --> 30:28.841
Frank?

31:00.199 --> 31:02.386
Those big SUVs are never safe.

31:02.463 --> 31:04.708
I've always steered clear of them myself.

31:14.658 --> 31:16.554
Alba, I feel you're upset--

31:16.787 --> 31:17.893
Why would I be upset?

31:17.894 --> 31:22.562
So, I spend so much time here, and... now, I get only some white shirts and this... boring suit.

31:22.597 --> 31:24.203
Well, at least it fits you.

31:24.455 --> 31:27.513
What can I do to make you happy? A drink or a dinner?

31:28.210 --> 31:30.010
Platinum cufflinks with diamonds.

31:30.029 --> 31:31.636
Okay, and then a dinner.

31:31.810 --> 31:33.784
No. No dinner. I'm sorry.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.436
- Okay, but I thought we are--
- Do you want the suit?

31:36.571 --> 31:37.733
What? No.

31:37.810 --> 31:40.346
Uh, y-yes. Of-of co-- Whatever you want.

31:41.352 --> 31:42.397
Okay.

31:42.997 --> 31:44.430
I'm just a mechanic.

31:47.333 --> 31:48.379
You look good.

31:49.192 --> 31:50.062
You too.

31:53.844 --> 31:54.938
No cufflinks.

31:55.170 --> 31:57.492
Your sister will be happy. Okay?

31:57.970 --> 31:58.828
Okay.

31:59.738 --> 32:01.364
I get off work at 8.

32:18.165 --> 32:19.171
Oh, shit!

32:21.068 --> 32:22.829
Where the hell have you been, Frank?

32:23.216 --> 32:24.125
Busy.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.022
I've got another job lined up.

32:26.177 --> 32:27.241
Toronto.

32:27.571 --> 32:28.867
I'm still on this one.

32:29.107 --> 32:31.720
I've been working on this deal for 2 months.

32:31.902 --> 32:36.837
The client was very clear. You were supposed to make contact 36 hours ago and he hasn't heard from you.

32:37.504 --> 32:41.434
He's called 4 times already today and he's threatening to cancel the contract.

32:42.982 --> 32:44.880
What happened to the schedule, Frank?

32:45.073 --> 32:47.977
Focus, Carla. I need you to focus. Put down whatever you're doing.

32:50.590 --> 32:52.758
Dodge Charger, 2011.

32:53.087 --> 32:57.752
Delta. Kilo. Echo... India. 39574.

32:58.399 --> 32:59.463
Wait a sec.

33:06.951 --> 33:09.177
The DKE series is restricted.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.171
Level 4 security.

33:11.576 --> 33:13.841
Could be NSA... CIA.

33:15.234 --> 33:16.337
Frank?

33:20.258 --> 33:21.284
Let's move.

33:21.554 --> 33:23.471
Goddamn state troopers.

33:28.050 --> 33:28.940
Here, buddy.

33:42.553 --> 33:43.811
Who were you calling?

33:44.779 --> 33:45.824
A contact.

33:46.753 --> 33:47.798
Xavier?

33:52.420 --> 33:54.975
She's the only one there I can trust, Frank.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.921
I have no other options. It's not like I can put it in the mail.

33:59.812 --> 34:02.289
I have to see this out, one way or the other.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.841
I'm not hiding anything, Frank!

34:06.879 --> 34:09.007
If I was dirty, I would've left you at the cemetery.

34:10.672 --> 34:12.047
You need me to drive.

34:12.453 --> 34:14.195
I need someone I can trust.

34:15.210 --> 34:17.474
I checked out others. Even ran one against you.

34:17.958 --> 34:19.100
The Mustang.

34:19.661 --> 34:20.996
She was good.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.525
But she's no Frank Martin.

34:23.337 --> 34:24.498
You know, I'm flattered.

34:24.924 --> 34:26.956
But you're a survivor. You'll be fine.

34:29.043 --> 34:32.141
I don't know, Frank. Maybe that's what I came back to find out.

34:35.043 --> 34:37.096
I trust the idea of a grandson.

34:37.985 --> 34:39.514
A kid who won't betray you.

34:42.501 --> 34:44.069
It's hard to come back in.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.494
Andy Gretz.

34:48.016 --> 34:50.107
Hits the bottle, beats up his wife...

34:50.203 --> 34:51.500
and when the cops come...

34:51.751 --> 34:54.074
he goes out the front door... firing.

34:54.170 --> 34:55.641
Gets about 6 feet.

34:56.938 --> 34:58.487
Sam Falstaff?

35:00.113 --> 35:02.706
He got so paranoid he couldn't even go outside.

35:03.403 --> 35:06.325
Some pizza guy shows up. Arab-looking kid.

35:06.549 --> 35:08.833
Wrong address, but Sam grabs 'im...

35:08.872 --> 35:11.523
fries his balls for 3 days with a car battery...

35:11.717 --> 35:13.130
until the cops come.

35:14.407 --> 35:17.484
Now he's doing the Thorazine shuffle in a facility upstate.

35:21.628 --> 35:23.119
I want to come home, but...

35:24.145 --> 35:25.519
I don't know if I can.

35:27.221 --> 35:29.466
When I left the service, I, uh...

35:31.257 --> 35:32.361
I worried, too.

35:32.961 --> 35:34.548
I thought I couldn't come back.

35:35.693 --> 35:36.971
Are you back, Frank?

35:39.216 --> 35:40.996
Seems to me you're still running.

35:46.235 --> 35:47.609
We're going to make it, Jack.

35:48.712 --> 35:49.912
That's the deal.

35:57.492 --> 35:58.924
We saw the Audi...

35:59.176 --> 36:01.228
at a gas station in Stamford.

36:01.538 --> 36:02.699
You couldn't pick him up?

36:02.951 --> 36:04.306
Local 5-0.

36:05.139 --> 36:06.823
And then the driver made us...

36:07.230 --> 36:08.430
and nabbed him up.

36:08.623 --> 36:10.650
So, what happened in Connecticut?

36:11.037 --> 36:12.779
That was 1 of Jack's dead drops.

36:13.679 --> 36:15.943
The Panama asset must've given it up.

36:16.233 --> 36:16.872
Huh.

36:17.550 --> 36:18.827
Well, something's off.

36:19.602 --> 36:23.442
Who's that driver? And why the ambush at the motel? And if he wants to come in, why's he fighting us off?

36:23.443 --> 36:25.513
I don't know. You know how these guys get.

36:26.370 --> 36:29.099
I don't want any more bodies.

36:29.622 --> 36:33.238
Well, we could've taken him out at Stamford and you told us to hold off.

36:33.239 --> 36:34.691
He's got something I want.

36:35.843 --> 36:38.649
Just as easy to get it from a dead asset as a live one.

36:39.423 --> 36:41.524
Why are you so anxious to kill him, Smith?

36:42.578 --> 36:44.455
I could ask you the same question.

36:48.108 --> 36:50.159
You know, maybe we should take it to the director.

36:51.011 --> 36:55.347
Hm. And maybe we can handle it... ourselves.

36:59.821 --> 37:00.686
All right.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.260
What's the play?

37:05.338 --> 37:06.634
He wants a meet.

37:31.491 --> 37:33.020
There's the driver right there.

37:33.647 --> 37:36.338
Huh. Gave your guys a lot of trouble, huh?

37:37.345 --> 37:38.661
He got lucky.

37:40.704 --> 37:43.181
Thanks for the ride, Frank. I got it from here.

37:43.917 --> 37:46.982
This is your Plan B? Wait for them to show up?

37:47.717 --> 37:50.756
Sometimes you just wait, figure out the play as it goes.

37:51.694 --> 37:54.577
Beat it, Frank. This isn't your fight.

37:55.197 --> 37:57.265
I've been thinking about a day at the beach.

37:58.446 --> 38:00.226
Now seems like as good a time as any.

38:00.439 --> 38:03.989
Hey. I paid for a transporter. I can't afford bodyguard rates.

38:06.337 --> 38:08.002
Well, this one's on the house.

38:10.057 --> 38:11.097
All right.

38:11.968 --> 38:13.661
But don't fuck things up.

38:13.734 --> 38:16.976
I want Perkins' information. It comes to me, and only me, understood?

38:17.992 --> 38:18.984
Understood.

38:19.081 --> 38:19.710
Good.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.563
It goes no further.

38:31.539 --> 38:32.507
Jack?

38:33.068 --> 38:34.171
Blanche.

38:36.807 --> 38:38.317
And Smith too?

38:39.419 --> 38:42.129
You're still wearing that shitty aftershave? What's he doing here?

38:42.942 --> 38:45.303
Well, this is big kid stuff, so get lost.

38:49.615 --> 38:52.654
Further, jackass. Come on, I can still smell you. Get outta here.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.092
Hey, Jack.

38:59.582 --> 39:01.072
You have a leak, Blanche.

39:01.692 --> 39:02.505
I know.

39:04.072 --> 39:05.505
Give me the drive, Jack.

39:06.703 --> 39:08.290
Maybe you are the leak.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.767
I just want you home safe.

39:20.689 --> 39:23.554
Everything on this drive came from the NSA mainframe.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.620
But your creeper left a trail.

39:26.145 --> 39:28.912
Look at the source codes. Find your mole.

39:29.260 --> 39:30.576
Give me the drive, Jack.

39:59.113 --> 39:59.926
Smith?

40:02.916 --> 40:03.516
Ah!

40:03.593 --> 40:05.258
Get him, Frank! I got these guys!

40:18.098 --> 40:19.124
Need a ride?

40:19.125 --> 40:20.189
What are you doing here?!

40:20.204 --> 40:22.875
I got a call from the blind dude. Said something about a Plan B?

40:22.933 --> 40:24.772
Nice move down in Philly, by the way.

40:26.979 --> 40:27.772
Push over!

40:29.542 --> 40:32.445
No, no, not him, you idiots! He's one of us!

40:32.446 --> 40:33.432
It's Smith!

40:35.851 --> 40:37.671
Um... what just happened?

40:37.709 --> 40:38.871
It's complicated.

41:26.710 --> 41:27.581
Smith!

41:29.777 --> 41:31.267
Hey, you cannot be here!

42:20.254 --> 42:21.202
Okay, man.

42:22.615 --> 42:23.912
Okay, you got me.

42:26.904 --> 42:28.781
Hey, come on.

42:59.623 --> 43:02.855
If you listen... everything stands still.

43:03.339 --> 43:04.365
Stands still.

44:27.511 --> 44:28.480
Who's the winner?

44:28.848 --> 44:29.699
Who is it?

44:30.178 --> 44:31.151
Straight ahead.

44:31.276 --> 44:32.302
Uh-huh.

44:32.515 --> 44:33.328
Okay.

44:34.762 --> 44:35.807
Can you give me a minute?

44:43.028 --> 44:45.911
That blind samurai routine is harder than it looks.

44:46.434 --> 44:49.269
Fight the space. Don't fight the man.

44:49.385 --> 44:50.759
Okay, Sensei.

44:52.492 --> 44:53.982
Thanks for bringing him home safe.

44:53.983 --> 44:55.202
You're welcome to him.

44:55.390 --> 44:56.048
Hm!

44:56.131 --> 44:58.133
Come on. He's one of the good guys.

44:58.501 --> 45:00.023
I was afraid you'd say that.

45:00.959 --> 45:01.636
Ah.

45:02.623 --> 45:03.997
I never really liked Smith.

45:04.268 --> 45:07.462
He seemed like a rich kid with a James Bond hard-on. Not a real agent.

45:07.714 --> 45:09.281
Someone taught him how to fight.

45:10.674 --> 45:11.952
Oh, no.

45:12.184 --> 45:13.500
Heh-heh-heh-heh!

45:14.401 --> 45:15.794
I didn't wanna say anything.

45:16.201 --> 45:17.672
Hey, he was never as good as you.

45:18.717 --> 45:19.955
Can you take him home, please?

45:20.168 --> 45:21.426
There's someone he needs to see.

45:23.531 --> 45:24.634
Let's go, Jack.

45:25.486 --> 45:26.473
On our way.

45:26.880 --> 45:27.712
Be safe.

45:31.758 --> 45:33.036
You need a clean shirt.

45:39.281 --> 45:40.461
Oh, Jack!

45:40.713 --> 45:42.397
Watch the goddamn car.

46:23.665 --> 46:25.233
I was wondering where you'd got to.

46:25.234 --> 46:27.517
A little too much cop action for me.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.478
You got plans tonight?

46:32.601 --> 46:34.361
I'm heading into Canada tomorrow.

46:34.671 --> 46:36.877
Oh, playing hard to get?

46:37.748 --> 46:38.677
Who's playing?

46:38.793 --> 46:40.941
I've been wanting to do this since Philly.

46:47.189 --> 46:49.802
I'm sorry I had to run out on you. I'll make it up to you.

46:50.073 --> 46:51.292
Yes, you will.

46:51.602 --> 46:53.548
You know anywhere we can get a drink in this town?

46:54.129 --> 46:54.903
Sure.

46:55.542 --> 46:56.606
You're driving?

47:07.935 --> 47:08.806
Seatbelt.

47:10.168 --> 47:11.929
You always wanted to be a driver?

47:12.703 --> 47:15.524
I was going to be an accountant. But the hours didn't work for me.

47:15.949 --> 47:17.382
Driving every day does?

47:17.672 --> 47:19.006
Unless it's a night drive.

47:19.045 --> 47:21.291
I like a little night driving myself.

47:22.413 --> 47:23.632
I'm sure you do.
