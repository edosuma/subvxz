WEBVTT

01:40.600 --> 01:42.976
- Looks just as good.
- Where do you get these?

01:43.144 --> 01:45.229
- He's got a million.
- They're so funny.

01:45.396 --> 01:48.357
Just remember,
don't mention the Communists.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.567
Calvin's a great guy,
but he's a little....

01:50.735 --> 01:52.569
- Nutty?
- What's his wife like?

01:52.737 --> 01:55.697
- You know, housewife.
- Likes to cook.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.866
- Pregnant.
- Normal, then.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.910
I wouldn't go that far.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.620
- Helen. Hi.
- Oh, hi, Betty.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.581
- Hi, Dave.
- Just look at you.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.084
- Any day now.
- Say hi to my sister, Ruth...

02:07.252 --> 02:09.377
Tell me if you heard this one.

02:09.545 --> 02:12.089
- A duck walks into a drugstore.
- Ha, ha.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.758
He says, "I'd like some lip gloss."

02:14.926 --> 02:17.928
The clerk says, "Certainly, sir.
Will this be cash or check?"

02:18.096 --> 02:21.849
- The duck says, "Put it on my bill." Ah?
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.269
Oh, brother.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.397
He was a golden-boy professor
at Caltech.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.315
But then he started inventing things.

02:30.567 --> 02:35.821
He suddenly became very rich,
and that was it, he quit teaching.

02:36.030 --> 02:39.825
- How's that?
- Just what the doctor ordered. Ha, ha!

02:39.993 --> 02:45.122
Calvin spends all of his time out there,
tinkering around in the workshop.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.624
If you ask me, it's all very strange.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.126
Same is true of batteries.

02:49.335 --> 02:54.965
I could take your simple yacht battery
and rig it to last a decade, easily.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.633
Say, Helen...

02:56.801 --> 02:59.636
what does Calvin think
about this trouble down in Cuba?

02:59.804 --> 03:03.432
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
please don't bring that up.

03:12.650 --> 03:17.446
I'd say my baseball card collection
is as complete as any one I've ever seen.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.115
Calvin? Hey, Calvin, Calvin.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.994
Kennedy is going toe to toe
with Khrushchev on television right now.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.663
- What?
- Ooh, boy.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.457
On the island of Cuba...

03:28.666 --> 03:31.835
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact...

03:32.003 --> 03:35.297
that a series
of offensive missile sites...

03:35.465 --> 03:39.593
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.529
Tower, this is Wolf 1.
I got five miles to the overhead.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.823
Wolf 1, Tower, report the numbers.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.492
You're number one for the overhead.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.039
Tower, this is Wolf 1,
I got a problem here.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.251
State your problem, Wolf 1.
Are you declaring an emergency?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.336
Stand by, 1.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.339
Additional sites appear
to be designed...

04:17.507 --> 04:19.507
for intermediate-range
ballistic missiles...

04:19.676 --> 04:23.053
and thus capable of striking
most of the major cities...

04:23.221 --> 04:25.389
in the western hemisphere.

04:25.556 --> 04:30.227
Folks, given this extraordinary turn
of events...

04:30.395 --> 04:33.021
I think it's prudent
we cut this evening short.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.440
I'm sure this Cuban thing
will resolve itself...

04:35.650 --> 04:36.858
but in the meantime...

04:37.026 --> 04:40.696
I suggest we take
a prayerful watch-and-wait stance.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.241
Okay, folks, let's go.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.702
Bye, Helen.
Wish it could have been longer.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.453
- My coat.
- Oh, here you go.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.789
I'll call you, Betty.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.210
What did I tell you?

04:56.587 --> 04:57.754
Thank you.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.427
I'm not gonna let this pot roast
go to waste.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.972
Calvin, could you put that seat cushion
back on the lawn chair, honey?

05:07.181 --> 05:09.308
Shouldn't we at least
turn off the phonograph?

05:09.475 --> 05:12.269
- It shuts off automatically.
- Oh. Did you rig it to do that?

05:12.437 --> 05:14.438
- They all do.
- Oh.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.273
I never know anymore.

05:18.234 --> 05:22.612
I'll bet that's a fighter jet
on its way to Key West.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.114
Good luck, amigo.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.158
An emergency has been declared.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.909
An emergency has been declared.

05:28.077 --> 05:32.289
You hear that?
I'll come back for the radio.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.459
Oh, Calvin, I wish you would've
at least let me do the dishes.

05:35.626 --> 05:39.129
It's not gonna be easy to get
all this dried-on food off my nice plates.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.965
I just hope those plates
are not radioactive by tomorrow.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.593
Well, cheese
is particularly troublesome.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.803
I've got secondaries of an engine fire.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.431
I'm gonna need to find a clear area
to eject.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.976
Roger, Wolf 1.
Can you make it to the ocean?

05:54.979 --> 05:56.730
Roger that, Tower.

05:56.939 --> 06:03.153
I'm marking the 180 radial for five
and ejecting, Tower.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.738
Roger, Wolf 1.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.504
So how long will we
have to stay down here?

06:20.671 --> 06:23.340
For this thing to blow over
could take days.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.093
Days? Honey, what if I go into labor?

06:26.260 --> 06:28.303
That could happen any time now.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.513
I've read up on it.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.475
If I have to,
I'll deliver the baby myself.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.711
Home, sweet home.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.171
To you, maybe.

07:15.017 --> 07:18.562
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

07:21.065 --> 07:25.402
Aah! It's happened.
Aah, look at that heat.

07:25.570 --> 07:30.198
All my surface indicators knocked out.
Oh, Lord!

07:30.366 --> 07:31.908
It's happened.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.125
What was that noise?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.045
The locks.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.631
The locks?

07:48.926 --> 07:52.429
To keep us from trying to leave.

07:52.597 --> 07:56.475
There's a radiation half-life
after an atomic blast.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.101
It lasts 35 years.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.937
Thirty-five years?

08:01.564 --> 08:05.984
Then, after that, it's safe to go up.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.783
According to Caltech, this Webber guy
was a bona fide genius...

08:13.951 --> 08:15.619
but a borderline nutcase.

08:15.786 --> 08:19.748
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
been out here when the plane hit.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.667
Unless we get a postcard or something,
that'd be my guess.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.296
- What about relatives?
- They're all back east.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.966
Neighbors over there said
the guy spent day and night out here.

08:30.134 --> 08:34.471
She'd bring him sandwiches
and hot Dr Pepper.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.975
- He drank it hot?
- Yeah.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.520
Good God.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.957
Hi, hon. Feeling better?

09:02.124 --> 09:03.458
No.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.252
We have to be strong...

09:05.419 --> 09:09.214
if not for ourselves, for the child.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.345
All our friends....

09:15.513 --> 09:17.681
Burnt to a crisp.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.727
- I'm not hungry.
- Hot Dr Pepper. Your favorite.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.814
No, Calvin, your favorite.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.567
Really?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.573
Chilly? Shouldn't be.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.243
- Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.
- Oh, maybe I've just got the creeps.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.787
How could you? This is just like home.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.873
No. No, Calvin.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.585
This is different, believe me.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.420
Would you like a tranquilizer?

09:49.797 --> 09:54.301
- You've got tranquilizers?
- I told you, I have everything.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.846
- What?
- Oh.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.473
Oh, hon.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.312
It's gonna be all right.
Yeah. Just breathe.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.481
I'll get my stuff.

10:11.902 --> 10:15.363
Oh, it's a good day
For singin' a song

10:15.531 --> 10:18.658
And it's a good day
For movin' along

10:18.826 --> 10:22.579
Yes, it's a good day
How could anything go wrong?

10:22.747 --> 10:25.248
A good day
From mornin' till night

10:25.416 --> 10:27.417
- Yes it's a good day
- It's a lovely day

10:27.585 --> 10:28.668
For shinin' your shoes

10:28.836 --> 10:31.087
- And it's a good day
- If you want a silver linin'

10:31.255 --> 10:32.297
For losin' the blues

10:32.465 --> 10:34.591
Everything to gain
And nothing to lose

10:36.135 --> 10:37.969
'Cause it's a good day
From mornin' to night

10:38.137 --> 10:39.179
You're right!

10:39.347 --> 10:42.849
I said to the sun "Good mornin', sun!"

10:43.017 --> 10:46.311
- Is there a problem?
- No, Calvin, babies cry.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.856
- I've noticed.
- What should we call him?

10:50.650 --> 10:51.858
I don't know.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.861
Well, I was thinking
in light of the situation...

10:55.029 --> 10:56.905
we should call him Adam.

10:57.073 --> 11:01.034
- That's not sacrilegious, is it?
- No, I think it's just right.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.622
And I was wondering if.... If....

11:06.957 --> 11:09.167
Whatever you want, Helen.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.794
I want a bedroom ceiling.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.341
You got it.

11:19.136 --> 11:22.305
'Cause it's a good day
For payin' your bills

11:22.473 --> 11:25.600
And it's a good day
For curin' your ills

11:25.768 --> 11:29.062
So take a deep breath
Throw away all your pills

11:29.230 --> 11:31.523
'Cause it's a good day
From mornin' till night

11:31.691 --> 11:34.567
See, I flick this switch...

11:34.735 --> 11:38.071
and the image is projected
onto a mirror...

11:38.239 --> 11:41.324
and the picture comes out here,
and it's perfect.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.461
- Well, almost perfect.
- Jackie Gleason.

11:53.629 --> 11:58.007
You know something? People will
never get tired of watching these.

12:07.852 --> 12:08.852
Lord...

12:09.019 --> 12:12.188
bless this food, this family...

12:12.398 --> 12:15.024
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

12:15.192 --> 12:18.027
- Amen.
- Amen.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.821
Let's eat.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.797
Calvin?

12:38.466 --> 12:42.218
- Out here, hon.
- Oh, there you are.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.346
We've looked all over for you.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.767
What are you doing back here?

12:48.934 --> 12:52.395
- I was just examining this rear hatchway.
- Why?

12:54.440 --> 12:58.401
Well, it's pretty clear that when the bomb
went off, the front entrance caved in...

12:58.569 --> 13:02.655
so, you know, we'll have to return
to the surface using this back entrance...

13:02.823 --> 13:05.658
which is very nice
because it has the service elevator.

13:06.702 --> 13:10.455
- Unless it's caved in too.
- Well, yes.

13:10.623 --> 13:15.794
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. You ready, Adam? Watch this.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.798
He can stand up all by himself.
Show Daddy.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.759
- All by himself. Stand up, Adam.
- That's my guy.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.010
Stand up.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.262
My son.

13:26.430 --> 13:30.767
Up, Adam, to the moon.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.575
Hey, boss.

13:47.743 --> 13:48.952
What do you make of this?

13:49.119 --> 13:51.621
- Damned if I know.
- Bet it's some kind of septic tank.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.957
Never seen a septic tank
that looked like that.

13:54.124 --> 13:57.210
Don't fool with it. If it is a septic tank,
I don't wanna open it.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.212
We'll just lay the foundation over it.

14:04.260 --> 14:09.097
"In Wonderland."

14:09.265 --> 14:13.852
I'd like to see the public school system
match that. I don't care how terrific it is.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.187
Don't you think
he's a little young for school?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.232
People have no idea
what the human mind is capable of.

14:19.400 --> 14:24.445
Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,
just like us.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.073
Will I ever get to go up on top?

14:27.241 --> 14:30.910
Yes, you certainly will,
and you'll find a nice girl...

14:31.078 --> 14:33.705
and rebuild America
just the way it used to be.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.834
Oh, Calvin. I'm not sure we should be
making promises that perhaps can't be kept.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.003
I'm convinced there'll be
other survivors.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.256
In fact, I'm guessing there's life
on the surface even now.

14:43.424 --> 14:47.510
Not life worth living, perhaps,
but believe me...

14:47.678 --> 14:49.637
something is moving around up there.

15:03.777 --> 15:06.446
I'm gonna need two more
banana splits and a Cherry Coke.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.031
You bet, Mom. Coming up.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.367
Oh, by the way, Mom, thanks for the job.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.870
- Buck-15 an hour.
- He's cute.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.833
Your husband is crazy.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.045
All right, what's the big news?

15:22.212 --> 15:26.299
- Ha-ha-ha. Ah.
- Oh, you're a riot.

15:26.467 --> 15:31.304
Oh, what a riot you are. Ha-ha-ha.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.265
- Watch this.
- Very funny. Ha-ha-ha!

15:34.433 --> 15:36.309
- Ha-ha-ha!
- You're a real riot.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.728
They're coming now to put you
on a stage.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.022
There's been complaints
about me on the bus.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.108
He's sending me
to the company psychiatrist.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.778
- Psychiatrist?
- Yeah, psychiatrist.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.365
- And that means I'm crazy.
- Oh, don't be silly, Ralph.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.826
Just sending you to a psychiatrist
doesn't mean you're crazy.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.120
Stick it. That's right.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.333
Hook off the jab. That's right.
Bob and weave. Bob and weave.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.834
Okay. Bob and weave.

16:02.002 --> 16:05.338
Excuse me, boys,
but I believe it's my turn now.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.978
Three, four, five...

16:20.145 --> 16:23.439
five, six, six, spin.

16:33.575 --> 16:36.661
- May I cut in?
- You certainly may.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.955
Thank you, sir.

17:14.907 --> 17:18.994
I miss those nice flower-power kids.
How about you?

17:19.829 --> 17:21.539
Ugh.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.209
I've heard people say

17:27.963 --> 17:30.423
What the hell kind of music is that?

17:31.925 --> 17:33.968
Oh, man.

17:34.136 --> 17:36.471
I'm not sure I like that.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.640
Change it.

17:39.808 --> 17:42.894
We've shared love and made love

17:44.063 --> 17:46.189
It's just not enough

17:46.356 --> 17:48.816
Oh, oh, babe

17:51.779 --> 17:54.989
My darling, I

17:55.157 --> 17:58.409
Can't get enough of your love, babe

17:59.369 --> 18:01.871
These are stock certificates.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.750
Your mom and I bought them for you.

18:05.918 --> 18:11.089
Of course, they're worthless now,
but at one time they were quite valuable.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.966
They're pretty. Could I have them?

18:14.176 --> 18:15.384
Heh. Sure.

18:15.552 --> 18:19.680
Now, let's move on to our French exam.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.975
Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday.

18:25.104 --> 18:29.690
Gosh, it is Tuesday.
Time flies, doesn't it?

18:43.914 --> 18:47.917
You have a wonderful sense
of humor, son, I must say.

18:48.460 --> 18:52.421
The acorn does not fall very far
from the tree.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.717
Oh, no! Agh! Oh, jeez. No.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.094
- I got you.
- I got...

18:58.262 --> 19:01.222
- Hi, hon.
- Hi.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.562
This is wonderful.

19:08.188 --> 19:12.650
It's my baseball card collection.
It's yours now.

19:13.777 --> 19:17.196
- What's baseball?
- It's a game, son.

19:17.364 --> 19:21.534
I can explain it pretty easily.
You see, there's a pitcher.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.619
Oh, like a painting?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.622
No. A pitcher.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.875
Like one of Mom's?

19:29.042 --> 19:33.129
No, there's a man who throws the ball
to a man who has a bat.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.674
- Oh, the nocturnal flying mammal?
- No.

20:00.616 --> 20:05.077
I'm selling this place.
I want out of this hellhole.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.997
Whoa. Uh....

20:08.165 --> 20:09.790
Could I, uh...?

20:09.958 --> 20:12.835
If you sell, uh....

20:13.462 --> 20:15.504
Me.... Could I, uh...?

20:15.672 --> 20:18.716
- Buy it from me?
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.845
- I'll give it to you, no money down.
- Cool.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.515
This neighborhood's going to hell,
anyway.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.646
At last! I am master of all I survey!

20:35.692 --> 20:36.776
No, no. Listen.

20:37.527 --> 20:40.154
I'm only gonna explain this
one more time.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.907
The runner on second goes to third.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.743
- It's... He's out there.
- Why?

20:45.911 --> 20:49.247
Because he's forced out.
It's... It's a force.

20:50.415 --> 20:54.585
- Then why go there?
- Because he must.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.922
- Calvin.
- Coming.

21:00.717 --> 21:01.884
Yes, dear?

21:02.052 --> 21:04.262
You get the presents,
I'll get the lights.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.972
You bet.

21:07.599 --> 21:11.852
Happy birthday to you

21:12.020 --> 21:15.856
And many more

21:16.024 --> 21:17.483
Ha!

21:18.235 --> 21:20.611
Thanks, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

21:20.862 --> 21:21.904
Blow out the candles.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.823
- Make a wish.
- Um....

21:29.871 --> 21:31.372
Here.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.925
Oh, boy, a jacket.

21:43.093 --> 21:46.095
- Your mom made that all by herself.
- No kidding?

21:46.263 --> 21:50.099
No kidding. Who else would have done it?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.310
I made these.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.695
Holy cow.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.780
What the heck are these?

22:04.990 --> 22:08.284
It's your roller skates, yup.
I redesigned them.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.287
These are really swell. I mean swell.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.122
Well, what did you wish for, son?

22:13.290 --> 22:16.167
- If he tells, it won't come true.
- That's a bunch of baloney.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.212
- My family never believed that.
- Well, we did, in my family.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.923
I wished that I could meet a girl.

22:24.134 --> 22:27.303
- Oh, well, a nice one?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:27.512 --> 22:31.974
- One that doesn't glow in the dark.
- Calvin Webber, what a thing to say.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.311
Well, we'll be going up in two years.
We'll know then.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.687
I'm very hopeful.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.231
Me too.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.649
- Elbows, son.
- Mm?

22:40.817 --> 22:43.444
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
What the heck am I thinking tonight?

22:43.612 --> 22:46.989
Well, you never know.
You might someday dine with the president.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.241
If we still have one. Ha, ha.

22:50.702 --> 22:54.288
You know, when we do go up,
I'm gonna miss this place.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.626
How about you, hon?

23:04.841 --> 23:07.343
Would you please excuse me?

23:07.511 --> 23:10.012
No, no, no, don't get up.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.911
- Should we say a prayer first?
- Just open the door.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.595
Long time.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.601
Well, it's dirty...

24:41.813 --> 24:44.106
but it seems to be okay.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.361
I know you're happy.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.658
Do we just go on up?

24:55.619 --> 24:56.785
No, son.

24:56.953 --> 25:00.331
Now is the time
we must be at our most cautious.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.876
- We wait for night.
- Oh, shit.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.128
Helen Thomas Webber...

25:06.338 --> 25:09.965
maybe we have been down here
a little too long.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.259
Pardon her French, son.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.303
"Shit" is French?

25:15.639 --> 25:16.889
Well, it's archaic French.

25:17.057 --> 25:22.186
It's a 16th-century colloquialism
meaning, roughly, "good."

25:22.395 --> 25:24.063
Your father's right.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.856
Well...

25:26.024 --> 25:27.358
shit.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.903
Ah.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.917
All of these things...

25:45.085 --> 25:50.548
Alcoholics Anonymous, Cocaine
Anonymous, uh, Heroin Anonymous...

25:50.715 --> 25:52.841
There's a Heroin Anonymous?

25:53.009 --> 25:56.011
Will you please shut up?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.555
Sorry, sorry.

25:57.722 --> 26:04.228
All of these things ask you to believe in
a power greater than yourself.

26:04.396 --> 26:08.607
Well, I have lifted my eyes skyward
a time or two...

26:08.775 --> 26:12.486
and I certainly have not seen
anything coming from up there.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.030
Except a goddamn airplane.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.033
Which I can't afford to get on.
Ha-ha-ha!

26:19.995 --> 26:22.538
Whoa, earthquake. Another earthquake.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.958
Let her come, let her come.
Let's get this over with.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.679
Oh, God. Oh, God.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.349
Oh, God.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.852
Oh, my God.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.854
Oh, God, save me.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.860
For I have seen the light.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.912
I come...

27:04.414 --> 27:06.081
in peace.

27:23.016 --> 27:26.894
Leave my elevator alone.

27:47.874 --> 27:51.168
What happened to my back yard?

28:29.124 --> 28:30.833
Got a light, honey?

28:31.584 --> 28:36.088
A light? Yes, I do have a light.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.342
Good. Thank you.

28:41.136 --> 28:45.639
- So you survived the blast.
- The blast? Ha, ha.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.766
Honey, I've survived a host of things.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.894
Like the song says,
a country boy can survive.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.938
Did you say you were a country boy?

28:53.148 --> 28:56.650
Cute little old man,
if you want a boy, I can be a boy...

28:56.818 --> 28:58.694
and if you want a girl, I can be a girl.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.320
I can be whatever you want me to be.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.989
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

29:02.198 --> 29:05.075
It's all yours
for the remarkably low price of $200.

29:05.285 --> 29:08.579
And if you act now, I may even
throw in some free lawn furniture.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.330
Now, how about that?

29:10.498 --> 29:12.833
No. Thanks.

29:13.001 --> 29:16.754
- Thank you. I have to go.
- Go.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.881
I have to go.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.550
Get out of here, you old drunk.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.892
Surprise. Bang! Ha-ha-ha.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.935
Oh!

29:36.524 --> 29:38.525
No!

29:41.321 --> 29:42.988
I'm gonna give it to you straight.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.157
There's no point
beating around the bush.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.408
There were survivors.

29:46.868 --> 29:51.997
Apparently, the fallout
has created a subspecies, mutants.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.042
Mutants?

29:55.210 --> 29:59.004
Not a pretty sight.
Some eat out of garbage cans, others...

29:59.172 --> 30:01.340
Cover your ears, son, and hum.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.092
I mean that literally.
I mean it right now.

30:06.012 --> 30:09.640
Others are multisexual.

30:09.849 --> 30:14.186
It seems they can be both masculine
and feminine simultaneously.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.771
- No.
- Yes.

30:15.939 --> 30:17.481
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.567
He tried to sell me his body, Helen.

30:20.735 --> 30:24.029
They offer lawn furniture as a come-on.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.075
All right.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.077
They have done a lot of rebuilding...

30:30.286 --> 30:33.497
though society, at least
as we know it, has totally collapsed.

30:33.665 --> 30:37.000
People throw up in the streets.
Others point guns.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.878
There's something terribly wrong
with the automobiles.

30:40.046 --> 30:44.258
I can't tell you the rest, I just can't.
Maybe someday.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.094
- So, what do we do now?
- We stay down here.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.388
- We do?
- Yes. We'll make do.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.015
We have clothes,
we have running water from a well.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.810
I am convinced these mutants
will kill each other off...

30:54.978 --> 30:58.480
No, Calvin, we won't make do.
Not me, not Adam.

30:58.648 --> 30:59.982
We're going up.

31:00.149 --> 31:02.568
I don't care how horrible it is.
We deserve it.

31:02.735 --> 31:06.071
- I am the head of this household.
- I want him to at least see the sky.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.866
- We will.
- The ocean, a mountain.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.326
Do as I say!

31:19.210 --> 31:20.878
- Dad?
- Ugh!

31:21.045 --> 31:22.588
- Son...!
- Oh, Adam.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.965
Oh, my goodness.
Let's get him to the bedroom.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.261
He seems to be doing all right now.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.346
I don't know if he had a heart attack...

31:31.514 --> 31:35.017
or just a horrifying experience,
but we need supplies...

31:35.184 --> 31:37.269
and I've gotta stay with him.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.604
I'll go up.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.816
- I'm afraid you must.
- I'll be all right.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.569
My brave boy.

31:47.488 --> 31:51.241
Just act normal.
And if anyone asks, simply say:

31:51.409 --> 31:53.702
"I'm from out of town.
I'm here on business."

31:53.870 --> 31:56.163
- Here on business.
- Write that down.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.291
Now, I'm gonna give you
a shopping list and some money.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.044
We'll need enough to get
through the next year or two.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.631
You'll find these items at what used
to be called a grocery store...

32:05.798 --> 32:08.008
or a hardware store. Write that down.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.178
I don't know how far
you'll have to travel to find supplies...

32:11.346 --> 32:15.390
but if you can't get home by nightfall,
I want you to look for a Holiday Inn.

32:15.558 --> 32:20.479
It's a hotel. Write that down.
There might still be one left standing.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.105
Oh.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.692
- Well, let's get you packed.
- Right.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.736
Just hope this is still good up there.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.655
- Say, Mom?
- Yes, dear?

32:29.822 --> 32:31.531
I was wondering, um...

32:31.699 --> 32:34.660
you know, while I was up there
and all, I was thinking....

32:34.827 --> 32:38.288
Well, you know,
I was wondering if maybe I could, uh...

32:38.915 --> 32:40.749
meet a girl.

32:41.542 --> 32:45.587
I've been thinking about that a little.
Just these last 15 years or so.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.174
Oh, Adam, it would be wonderful
if you could meet a girl.

32:49.342 --> 32:52.219
One who's not a mutant
and hopefully comes from Pasadena.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.597
Nothing against Valley girls,
but in my day, anyhow...

32:55.765 --> 32:59.476
girls from Pasadena, I don't know,
just always seemed a little bit nicer.

32:59.644 --> 33:04.064
Oh, and, son, there's also something
called a liquor store.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.816
Write that down.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.859
Liquor store.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.795
Calvin?

33:32.969 --> 33:34.177
Son.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.728
Adam.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.146
Yes, Father?

33:44.313 --> 33:50.610
Don't forget:
Stay out of the adult bookstore.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.406
Adult bookstore. Why?

33:55.408 --> 33:59.578
Poison gas. Invisible.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.873
Don't forget.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.959
I promise. Is that all?

34:06.127 --> 34:07.669
Uh.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.216
One more thing.

34:15.553 --> 34:20.514
If you find a healthy young woman...

34:22.268 --> 34:24.226
bring her on down.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.063
Yes, sir.

34:27.648 --> 34:29.107
Uh.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.213
Are you all right?

34:51.380 --> 34:55.050
Yes, yes. Oh, Lord, yes.

34:55.217 --> 34:58.970
Are you the one who came last night
all in yellow?

34:59.180 --> 35:02.933
All in yellow? Oh, that was my father.

35:03.726 --> 35:05.769
Oh, of course. The father.

35:06.562 --> 35:11.233
Forgive me.
Can you forgive me for my wasted life?

35:11.442 --> 35:13.318
Everything has been so awful.

35:13.569 --> 35:16.404
I know, it has been terrible.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.740
But it's not your fault.

35:18.908 --> 35:22.327
And now that all the decay is over with,
things are going to get better.

35:22.954 --> 35:26.706
- You understand?
- Yes, yes.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.087
- Well, I have to go now.
- Of course, of course you do.

35:32.255 --> 35:36.216
- I'll stay here and pray.
- See, now, that's always a good idea.

35:36.425 --> 35:37.759
Yeah.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.761
How do I leave this place?

35:40.429 --> 35:42.139
Uh, the front door is open.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.475
Will you be back?

35:46.269 --> 35:47.602
I promise.

36:25.474 --> 36:26.892
What?

36:27.059 --> 36:28.685
What is it?

36:29.270 --> 36:30.312
The sky.

36:30.980 --> 36:34.774
- The sky? Where?
- Up there.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.819
- I don't see anything.
- Just look.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.988
What is it?

36:40.156 --> 36:42.908
He says he sees something.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.079
- What is it?
- The sky.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.331
I see it, Mommy.

36:49.498 --> 36:53.168
I have never in my life
seen anything like it before.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.004
Or like you.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.179
What are you looking at?

37:04.347 --> 37:07.682
Oh, my lucky stars, a Negro.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.101
- Say what?
- How do you do, ma'am?

37:10.311 --> 37:11.937
I do all right.

37:12.146 --> 37:16.233
- Ha, ha. Good.
- Okay?

37:18.069 --> 37:20.237
What is it? What do you see?

37:20.404 --> 37:23.114
Oh, we were just looking at the...

37:23.282 --> 37:24.824
- Oh, no!
- What?

37:24.992 --> 37:28.203
Poisonous gas! Run for your life!
Run! Run! Run for your life!

37:28.371 --> 37:31.539
Invisible poisonous gas!

37:35.962 --> 37:37.462
- You know...
- Aah!

37:39.924 --> 37:41.967
I just wanna say...

37:42.635 --> 37:44.886
I think he's gonna be fine.

37:45.721 --> 37:48.807
Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very much.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.267
He's smart.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.727
Yes, dear, I know.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.064
But he's still such a baby.

37:56.232 --> 37:58.900
He's a man.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.819
He's a baby man.

38:01.779 --> 38:06.574
I tried to give the driver this,
but he wouldn't take it.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.744
Seems kind of angry.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.705
Lot of people do.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.958
Oh, boy. Here we go.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.711
Hold on, everyone. Hold on.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.921
Wow. Ha-ha-ha.

38:20.089 --> 38:22.215
So this is public transportation.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.885
My father says it becomes more and
more important because of pollution...

38:26.053 --> 38:30.223
which is more and more carbon dioxide
and other hazardous gases in the air.

38:31.475 --> 38:33.268
Do you have a gun, by the way?

38:36.272 --> 38:39.399
Oh. Well, thank you
for not waving it around.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.277
And for not vomiting, for that matter.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.613
Say, do you know
where I could find a grocery store?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.073
I have to find that.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.451
That and a hardware store
and a liquor store...

38:49.618 --> 38:52.120
- ...and a standing Holiday Inn.
- Uh... Uh...

38:52.288 --> 38:55.123
- ...there's a grocery store up the street.
- Where? Where?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.750
- Up there.
- Oh, thank you.

38:56.917 --> 39:00.587
Driver, please stop the bus immediately.
I wish to get off.

39:00.796 --> 39:03.590
- Please stop the bus, sir.
- Stop the bus!

39:07.345 --> 39:09.804
- Paper or plastic?
- Paper, please.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.639
Do you have a club card?

39:13.267 --> 39:14.309
Here you go.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.728
I need a price check on Register 4...

39:16.896 --> 39:18.563
Diet Dr Pepper six-pack.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.444
- Ah-ha!
- Ha.

39:28.491 --> 39:31.826
A manager to the front,
check approval, Register 1.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.078
Can I help you?

39:33.245 --> 39:36.498
Oh, yes. Uh, I'd like to get
some all-beef patties.

39:36.665 --> 39:37.832
Fresh or frozen?

39:38.793 --> 39:43.088
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

39:43.339 --> 39:46.007
Frozen they're 6.30 a dozen
in a 3-pound box.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.468
Twelve into 900 is 75.

39:48.677 --> 39:52.097
That's almost $500
just for the hamburger.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.849
My mother only gave me $3000
for everything.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.935
The yacht batteries, the pipe tobacco...

39:57.103 --> 40:00.271
the diesel oil, the bleach,
the floss, the birthday candles....

40:00.439 --> 40:03.525
You could get a meat order that big
delivered to your home.

40:03.692 --> 40:05.610
- Really?
- Sure.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.363
Oh, well, that's terrific. Heh.

40:09.323 --> 40:12.575
Except it just occurred to me
that I don't know where home is.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.995
I'm lost.

40:16.163 --> 40:18.331
- Do you know where I live?
- No.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.959
- Will you please excuse me?
- Gladly.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.294
Thank you.

40:47.736 --> 40:50.989
Driver, please stop the bus.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.769
- Hello.
- Hi.

41:21.937 --> 41:25.607
The name's Adam Webber,
and I see that you buy baseball cards.

41:25.774 --> 41:28.401
Although these are older
than the ones in the window...

41:28.569 --> 41:30.570
I was hoping
that you still might be interested.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.906
Uh... Oh, ahem.

41:33.073 --> 41:35.700
How much you want for this
Mickey Mantle rookie season?

41:35.868 --> 41:38.203
Well, I was hoping
to sell all of the cards.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.413
Really? No kidding?

41:40.581 --> 41:43.625
All I have are hundred-dollar bills.
I need something smaller.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.377
- You know, ones, tens, fives.
- I see what you mean.

41:46.545 --> 41:47.795
I'll tell you what.

41:47.963 --> 41:52.634
How about I give you $500
in small bills for the whole box?

41:54.303 --> 41:57.055
- That would be wonderful.
- Ah, shit.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.476
I'm working here, Evie-poo,
don't screw me up.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.896
Yeah, I can see you're working,
all right.

42:07.983 --> 42:09.400
Oh, you're French?

42:10.194 --> 42:14.155
No. I'm from out of town.
I'm here on business.

42:14.323 --> 42:16.616
Your business must not
be sports memorabilia...

42:16.784 --> 42:18.826
because this one Mantle card right here?

42:18.994 --> 42:22.163
Worth $6000 all by its itty-bitty self.

42:22.331 --> 42:25.291
- Get out of here.
- No, you get out of here.

42:25.501 --> 42:28.086
Terrific. You're fired,
you know that, huh?

42:28.295 --> 42:30.797
- I quit.
- No, no, no, I fired you.

42:31.006 --> 42:33.508
Just like the hair-salon guy
and the Chevy dealer.

42:33.759 --> 42:36.344
You know why
you can't keep a goddamn job?

42:36.512 --> 42:39.138
Because you can't keep
your goddamn mouth shut.

42:39.348 --> 42:41.349
Excuse me,
but I'd really appreciate it...

42:41.517 --> 42:44.102
if you wouldn't take
the Lord's name in vain again.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.271
You got a problem with that, partner?

42:46.480 --> 42:49.774
Yes, I have a big problem with that.

42:50.818 --> 42:53.528
Come on, Heathcliff. I'll walk you out.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.532
Yes, ma'am, but my name's Adam.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.535
Ha! Adam and Eve, the perfect match.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.037
I hope the two of you
will be very happy together.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.539
Mazel-fucking-tov.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.833
And don't come back, neither,
Miss Big-Shot.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.669
I'm serious,
you're finished in the hobby business.

43:09.878 --> 43:12.714
- So where are we going?
- We? I'm going home.

43:12.881 --> 43:15.842
Judging by that coat, you have to
get back to barber college.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.218
No, I'm lost.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.345
- Ugh. You're lost?
- Uh-huh.

43:19.513 --> 43:22.390
Say, did you just lose your job
back there because of me?

43:22.558 --> 43:25.393
Oh, forget about it.
I'm sick of working for that dickhead.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.728
- Dickhead?
- Yes.

43:26.895 --> 43:29.522
A walking penis
capable of intelligent speech.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.357
A dickhead.

43:31.900 --> 43:34.736
- What is wrong with you?
- I just had this mental picture...

43:34.903 --> 43:37.322
Here, help me pick these up.

43:37.489 --> 43:40.366
Oh, thank you.

43:41.201 --> 43:44.329
- Where are you parked?
- I came on a bus.

43:44.496 --> 43:45.913
Why does that not surprise me?

43:46.081 --> 43:48.082
I don't know,
why doesn't it surprise you?

43:48.334 --> 43:50.752
Well, I guess because
I'm a little psychic.

43:50.919 --> 43:54.088
- I have this thing.
- Oh, that's nice.

43:54.298 --> 43:58.092
Yeah. Let me guess something.
This is your first visit to la-la land.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.762
You're staying in Hollywood
because like an idiot...

44:00.929 --> 44:03.681
you thought that would be exciting.
Am I right so far?

44:03.849 --> 44:05.850
- So far.
- Yes, I'm right?

44:06.060 --> 44:07.393
- Right.
- I knew it.

44:07.561 --> 44:09.604
You get on a bus,
and before you know it...

44:09.772 --> 44:12.732
you're stuck in the
San Fernando Valley without a clue.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.942
- Correct again?
- Again.

44:15.110 --> 44:17.570
Where are you staying?

44:17.946 --> 44:19.238
The Holiday Inn.

44:19.406 --> 44:22.909
Whoa. Yes, yes, the Holiday Inn,
that's exactly right.

44:23.077 --> 44:26.454
See? I'm psychic. I mean,
not completely, but pretty much.

44:26.622 --> 44:30.208
- Pretty good, huh?
- No, it was amazing.

44:30.376 --> 44:31.751
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.878
Anyhow, I'm gonna predict a bus for you.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.797
- You go down here...
- Do you own a car?

44:35.964 --> 44:38.716
Oh, no, sweetie.
Rule number one in North America:

44:38.884 --> 44:40.551
No strangers in the car.

44:40.719 --> 44:43.846
Well, if it'll make you feel any better,
I don't have a gun.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.390
Oh.

44:45.557 --> 44:48.893
Well, that changes everything.
Get away from me.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.104
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, I said something wrong.

44:51.271 --> 44:52.438
Please forgive me.

44:52.606 --> 44:54.565
- Get away from me.
- I'll make you a deal.

44:54.733 --> 44:57.860
I will give you a Rogers Hornsby
if you take me to the hotel.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.739
Rogers Hornsby?

45:02.324 --> 45:04.617
He's yours. I was holding him back.

45:04.827 --> 45:09.080
- Rogers Hornsby's worth like $4000.
- So what? I got two of them.

45:09.248 --> 45:14.419
And this many
Larry "Yogi" Berras and... And, uh....

45:14.628 --> 45:18.005
So for $4000, all I have to do
is drive you to your hotel?

45:18.173 --> 45:19.757
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- That's it?

45:19.925 --> 45:21.968
I don't have to take a physical
on your spaceship?

45:22.136 --> 45:24.846
No, ma'am. What?

45:32.146 --> 45:34.814
So, Mr. Andretti,
your first time on the freeway?

45:35.023 --> 45:37.024
It's Webber. Adam Webber.

45:37.192 --> 45:40.027
Mind if I change the station?
Better traffic reports on a.m.

45:40.195 --> 45:41.654
Sure.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.115
- Wait.
- What? What is it?

45:44.283 --> 45:46.284
Go back. You had him, it's Perry.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.953
- Perry?
- Perry Como.

45:49.121 --> 45:51.831
Go back, you had him. Go back, go back.

45:52.040 --> 45:55.376
- Back, back.
- Okay, okay.

45:55.544 --> 45:58.087
- That's it.
- There.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.719
I could die right now.

46:04.970 --> 46:08.222
- Over this?
- Yeah.

46:08.390 --> 46:12.059
Happy sound
As it goes along the ground

46:12.227 --> 46:13.895
Listen to this part.

46:14.062 --> 46:17.231
This is where it really takes off.
Wait for it.

46:17.441 --> 46:18.983
There.

46:19.151 --> 46:21.360
You'll hold her round, round, round

46:21.528 --> 46:24.572
You are one scary son of a gun.

46:25.908 --> 46:29.535
And your head
Goes spinning round, round, round

46:29.703 --> 46:32.663
'Cause you found
What you've been dreamin' of

46:38.086 --> 46:39.462
You better slow down.

46:39.671 --> 46:42.215
I can't help it.
Perry Como always does this to me.

46:42.382 --> 46:44.967
I just get so cranked.

46:45.928 --> 46:49.555
Makes a girl and boy wanna say

46:49.723 --> 46:51.808
- Find the ring
- Find the ring

46:51.975 --> 46:54.060
And put it round, round, round

46:57.606 --> 47:01.442
- Card, please, end of service.
- That was wonderful.

47:01.610 --> 47:04.111
I've never felt anything
like that before in my life.

47:04.279 --> 47:07.031
Yeah, same here.
Don't forget your suitcase.

47:08.534 --> 47:09.951
- Right.
- You know, Eve....

47:15.415 --> 47:16.916
Hello.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.418
- Hi.
- I would like to stay at this hotel.

47:19.628 --> 47:22.380
Fill this out, please,
and I'll need to see a card.

47:23.757 --> 47:26.467
- A card?
- Yes, sir.

47:27.094 --> 47:30.096
Oh, of course.

47:37.020 --> 47:39.814
Okay, then. Ugh.

47:39.982 --> 47:43.734
Bathroom's there,
TV's there, remote is on top.

47:43.902 --> 47:46.529
Room-service menu on the table.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.240
Wow.

48:00.002 --> 48:01.752
Oh, you, uh, dial nine to get out.

48:03.672 --> 48:04.797
Of what?

48:06.466 --> 48:07.925
The hotel.

48:09.636 --> 48:11.262
I see.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.183
Well, thank you.
You've been very, very helpful.

48:16.351 --> 48:18.519
I managed to get some change
downstairs...

48:18.687 --> 48:21.355
and my father taught me
in situations such as this...

48:21.523 --> 48:23.816
it's customary to give a tip.

48:23.984 --> 48:28.571
- Well, your father's a smart guy.
- My father's a genius.

48:30.574 --> 48:31.699
Okay.

48:31.867 --> 48:35.202
All right, well, uh, here's your key,
and good night, sir.

48:35.370 --> 48:37.038
Thank you. Good night, sleep tight.

48:37.205 --> 48:40.207
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
That's what my mom always says.

48:40.375 --> 48:43.169
Who I'm really beginning to miss,
by the way.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.631
I'm sorry.
It's my first night away from home.

48:47.966 --> 48:49.050
How old are you?

48:50.218 --> 48:51.969
Thirty-five.

48:52.554 --> 48:55.514
- You don't look 35.
- How old do I look?

48:55.682 --> 48:59.810
- Oh, 25, around there.
- Hmm.

49:00.103 --> 49:03.147
I guess living up here
makes people look older.

49:03.815 --> 49:05.650
Up here on the 18th floor?

49:06.652 --> 49:10.404
Yes, up here on the 18th floor.
Good night.

49:23.919 --> 49:25.336
Yes, you're absolutely right.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.421
What in the hell am I doing here?

49:27.589 --> 49:30.925
That's what I'd like to know.
Somebody tell me that.

49:31.635 --> 49:38.140
Natural oils, tropical fruits,
flora, nuts, and protective sunscreens.

49:38.350 --> 49:41.102
A complete sun-care line
created by one man...

49:43.438 --> 49:45.564
for one reason...

49:48.360 --> 49:49.443
Yes?

49:49.611 --> 49:52.113
Hi. This is the woman
from the baseball card store.

49:52.280 --> 49:54.365
- Remember me?
- Oh, yes.

49:54.533 --> 49:58.703
Hi. Hello. Hot diggity dog.

49:58.870 --> 50:00.705
Thanks for calling me on the telephone.

50:07.629 --> 50:10.965
Ha. I'm so glad to see you.
I thought I'd never see you again.

50:11.174 --> 50:12.800
Yeah, okay, okay. Down, boy.

50:12.968 --> 50:15.970
Listen, I can't take this
for driving you home.

50:16.138 --> 50:17.680
I wish I could, but I can't.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.807
- So here, take it back.
- Uh-uh.

50:20.475 --> 50:23.227
I would've left it at the front desk,
but it's valuable.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.813
- I can't take that, it's yours.
- Take it, damn it.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.273
Okay.

50:27.482 --> 50:30.943
- Why are you doing that?
- Because I haven't brushed yet.

50:32.320 --> 50:36.157
Oh, okay.
Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.

50:36.324 --> 50:40.745
- Wait. Eve, please wait.
- Please, do not follow me. Don't do it.

50:40.912 --> 50:43.497
Oh, I knew this would happen.
You're like a lost puppy.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.458
Can't you talk to me for one second?

50:45.625 --> 50:48.794
- Just one little second, please?
- Okay.

50:48.962 --> 50:51.172
Damn. I should've
taken the money and run.

50:51.339 --> 50:54.717
That's what Troy told me to do,
but did I listen? No.

50:54.926 --> 50:56.302
Will you put your hand down?

50:57.929 --> 51:00.598
Who's Troy? Is he your husband?

51:00.807 --> 51:03.100
- Or a boyfriend?
- No.

51:03.727 --> 51:07.688
- Thank you!
- Stop that, don't do that.

51:07.856 --> 51:11.484
Listen, I know you like me, okay?
I can tell.

51:11.651 --> 51:14.695
But you know what?
A lot of guys like me.

51:14.863 --> 51:16.030
Not me exactly.

51:16.198 --> 51:19.617
More like my legs, my butt or my hair
or some combination of the above.

51:19.785 --> 51:21.202
I think it's the eyes.

51:21.995 --> 51:23.496
The eyes?

51:23.663 --> 51:26.874
Great, an eye man.
Anyhow, it never works out, okay?

51:27.042 --> 51:29.043
Not that you even need to know that.

51:29.211 --> 51:31.796
You look like crap.
What have you been doing?

51:31.963 --> 51:34.673
Watching television in color.

51:36.051 --> 51:38.010
In color? No kidding.

51:38.178 --> 51:42.973
- Mm-hm. Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Yeah. See you.

51:43.141 --> 51:45.518
- Why doesn't it ever work out?
- What?

51:45.685 --> 51:47.686
Why doesn't it ever work out,
you and men?

51:47.854 --> 51:50.397
Why? Who the hell knows?

51:50.565 --> 51:53.067
If you promise to leave me alone,
I'll tell you why.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.360
Okay.

51:54.528 --> 51:58.906
It never works out because I am into legs
and hair and butts myself, that's why.

51:59.074 --> 52:01.200
I wind up with guys
who are good-looking...

52:01.368 --> 52:04.245
but even more shallow than I am,
if you can picture that.

52:04.412 --> 52:06.997
Excuse me, I have to go find
another low-paying job...

52:07.165 --> 52:10.668
where some guy named Jerry keeps
telling me how lousy his marriage is.

52:10.836 --> 52:12.711
- Why not go to work for me?
- Doing what?

52:12.879 --> 52:14.839
Helping me sell all my baseball cards...

52:15.006 --> 52:18.008
and buying enough food and supplies
to fill several trucks.

52:18.176 --> 52:20.886
Food and supplies?
Who for, like, starving people?

52:21.054 --> 52:24.557
Oh, well, they're not starving yet,
but they do need help.

52:24.766 --> 52:28.102
- Well, how long would you need me for?
- Two weeks.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.521
- What's the pay?
- What's fair?

52:30.730 --> 52:33.899
Well, I gotta make at least
a thousand dollars a week.

52:39.406 --> 52:40.698
You got it.

52:40.866 --> 52:43.117
- Wait here while I get changed.
- Sure.

52:46.538 --> 52:48.038
Sure.

52:54.129 --> 52:55.921
There you go.

52:56.131 --> 53:00.885
Why would someone need
26 yacht batteries?

53:01.052 --> 53:03.470
I don't know, I just work for the guy.

53:03.638 --> 53:05.973
And who does he work for, the CIA?

53:06.141 --> 53:08.392
Pipe tobacco. Ha-ha-ha.

53:09.060 --> 53:10.728
I'm gonna need all of this.

53:13.481 --> 53:15.316
Toilet paper.

53:17.485 --> 53:19.445
Is there a sale?

53:34.878 --> 53:38.172
Well, another day, another dollar.

53:44.262 --> 53:47.264
- Will you stop staring at me?
- Sorry.

53:47.766 --> 53:50.851
- I'll pick you up at 8 in the morning.
- Oh.

53:53.521 --> 53:56.690
- You know, Eve, I was thinking...
- Night.

53:57.025 --> 53:58.776
Night.

54:16.419 --> 54:19.880
We'll need to rent a refrigerated truck
for the beef and poultry.

54:20.048 --> 54:24.343
Well, it's your life.
And by the way, it's a dandy.

54:26.888 --> 54:29.348
Think we're also gonna have to get
another locker.

54:29.516 --> 54:32.393
It's no problem.
We'll just sell another baseball card.

54:34.187 --> 54:36.730
- Coming down.
- Okay.

54:40.402 --> 54:43.612
Ah, whoo. Ha-ha-ha.

54:45.740 --> 54:47.241
You know, Eve...

54:47.409 --> 54:49.994
And don't get mad, okay?

54:50.704 --> 54:53.747
But I would just be lost without you.

54:57.002 --> 54:58.335
Thanks.

54:59.421 --> 55:02.047
Ha-ha-ha. And I guess, uh....

55:02.716 --> 55:04.383
I guess that....

55:04.551 --> 55:07.678
- I think that you and I...
- Adam, don't even think about it, okay?

55:07.846 --> 55:09.972
I'm sorry, I know that sounds mean...

55:10.181 --> 55:12.975
but believe me, it'd be a lot meaner
if I didn't say it, okay?

55:13.143 --> 55:14.268
- Mm-hm.
- Okay?

55:14.436 --> 55:16.186
- Okay.
- Let's take this truck back...

55:16.354 --> 55:18.022
and I'm hungry.

55:21.234 --> 55:22.359
Are you getting in?

55:27.615 --> 55:29.575
There's something else
I'd like help with.

55:29.743 --> 55:30.784
Name it.

55:30.994 --> 55:33.620
I'm afraid this is gonna sound
a little bit crazy.

55:33.788 --> 55:36.749
- Heh. I'm sure it will.
- Then forget it.

55:36.958 --> 55:39.418
No, no. I'm sorry.

55:39.586 --> 55:40.711
What is it?

55:42.130 --> 55:45.799
Eve, I want you to help me find a wife.

55:46.051 --> 55:48.135
- A wife?
- Yes.

55:48.303 --> 55:51.555
- What for?
- Because I want to get married.

55:51.723 --> 55:53.140
Why?

55:53.308 --> 55:54.933
Because I don't want to be alone.

55:55.101 --> 55:59.480
Well, you can be single and not alone.
Marriage bites.

55:59.647 --> 56:01.648
- Bites what?
- The big one.

56:01.816 --> 56:04.401
- It does?
- Sure.

56:04.569 --> 56:07.946
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- Everybody knows that.

56:08.114 --> 56:12.159
Ask my divorced brothers
or my divorced mom and dad.

56:12.660 --> 56:14.286
Everybody knows that.

56:14.496 --> 56:17.748
- They're all divorced?
- Everybody's divorced.

56:19.542 --> 56:20.876
Wow.

56:22.462 --> 56:25.339
- What kind of wife you looking for?
- Hmm? Oh, um....

56:25.507 --> 56:28.759
Well, one who's not a mutant.

56:28.927 --> 56:32.596
Heh. No dogs, huh? Okay, cool.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.182
And if it's possible...

56:35.350 --> 56:37.851
I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.

56:43.316 --> 56:45.818
Um, when do you need her by?

56:47.695 --> 56:48.821
Two weeks?

56:49.531 --> 56:51.573
I can probably get you laid
in two weeks...

56:51.783 --> 56:57.663
but to locate a non-mutant wife
from Pasadena could take some time.

56:58.289 --> 57:00.582
That's what I was afraid of.

57:05.839 --> 57:08.298
What do you mean, you can get me laid?

57:10.677 --> 57:13.303
- Uh, can we talk about that a little later?
- Of course.

57:13.471 --> 57:14.805
Great.

57:16.683 --> 57:19.143
Lord, bless this food
we are about to receive...

57:19.310 --> 57:22.354
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

57:22.564 --> 57:24.898
And bless my mom and bless my dad...

57:25.150 --> 57:27.234
and bless my new friend Eve.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.069
Amen.

57:29.237 --> 57:31.155
Amen.

57:39.122 --> 57:40.914
- Get out.
- The engine is still running.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.749
Now. Get out.

57:42.917 --> 57:44.585
- Yes, ma'am.
- Stop the "ma'am" crap.

57:44.752 --> 57:46.253
I'm sorry.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.422
You almost got us killed.

57:48.673 --> 57:51.925
- I told you, I've never driven before.
- Well, never drive again.

57:52.177 --> 57:56.388
- You said it would be easy.
- Well, I was wrong.

57:56.556 --> 57:58.599
- Say, is this your house?
- Yes.

57:58.766 --> 58:01.727
- I like it.
- What are you bitching about now?

58:02.270 --> 58:05.439
- What are you doing here?
- I forgot some of my stuff.

58:05.648 --> 58:07.191
- Your stuff?
- Yeah.

58:07.358 --> 58:09.276
Let me see that.

58:09.444 --> 58:11.278
Oh, you came back for your underwear.

58:11.446 --> 58:14.531
Excuse me, these are Ralph Laurens.

58:14.699 --> 58:16.742
How did you get in?

58:17.368 --> 58:19.119
Thanks.

58:19.287 --> 58:21.872
And who's this
interesting-looking fellow?

58:22.081 --> 58:25.918
- This is Adam. Adam, this is Cliff.
- How do you do?

58:26.085 --> 58:27.878
I do fine, Adam.

58:28.087 --> 58:31.924
How about yourself?
You, uh, doing any good lately?

58:32.133 --> 58:34.134
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.

58:34.302 --> 58:36.053
Sheena Gilroy's apartment.

58:36.221 --> 58:39.556
You remember her.
She's the, uh, model who went to Harvard.

58:40.683 --> 58:41.725
Hmm.

58:41.893 --> 58:45.062
Well, I'd better be going. Bye, Adam.

58:45.230 --> 58:46.939
- Nice coat.
- Thank you, Cliff.

58:47.106 --> 58:51.151
- It was very nice to meet you.
- That's a nice parking job too.

58:51.319 --> 58:53.820
- May I ask you a question?
- He's a former boyfriend.

58:53.988 --> 58:57.908
We lived together for about six months,
and I still have sort of a thing for him.

58:58.076 --> 58:59.993
That's what you wanted to know,
isn't it?

59:00.203 --> 59:01.662
No, I was gonna ask you...

59:01.829 --> 59:04.498
why Cliff likes to wear
another man's underpants.

59:04.707 --> 59:05.832
What?

59:14.300 --> 59:16.385
Rhinoceros

59:18.513 --> 59:20.097
Rhinoceros

59:20.265 --> 59:23.267
This guy is unbelievable.

59:23.434 --> 59:24.476
I knew you'd like him.

59:24.644 --> 59:27.020
I know. It's like he's
from X-Files or something.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.856
He's got all these
easily negotiable properties, right?

59:30.024 --> 59:31.858
He's obviously setting up something big.

59:32.026 --> 59:34.361
Maybe a self-sustaining island
off South America.

59:34.529 --> 59:39.157
Maybe he's the leader of some cult into
practices involving poultry and tobacco.

59:40.618 --> 59:43.579
You just wake up

59:44.747 --> 59:45.789
Rhinoceros

59:45.957 --> 59:49.543
- You have very nice ceilings.
- Do I?

59:50.211 --> 59:54.006
Well, you like ceilings?

59:54.173 --> 59:56.133
Not particularly.

59:56.718 --> 01:00:00.846
Ah. Well, I hope you like this.
It's sea urchin wrapped in seaweed, or nori.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.055
I love sushi.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:06.893
- I love Lucy.
- Who doesn't? She's hilarious.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.273
- Here you go, one champagne cocktail.
- Oh, thank you.

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:13.525
I thought only hookers
drank those things.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:15.902
Well, I know Mom sure likes them.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.951
Well, dinner's in 15.
Why don't we sit down and chat?

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.453
Mm-hm.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:28.874
- So, Troy, what do you do for a living?
- Oh, I design websites.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.626
Mm.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:32.669
And, Adam...

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:34.421
where on earth are you from?

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:38.091
- Out of town. That's all he'll say.
- Mm-hm. It's a very small place.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:41.928
- People don't even know it's there.
- And it's called?

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.264
Maybe Eve can guess.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:46.600
- She's psychic.
- Is she?

01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:50.896
- Since when?
- Since I got rear-ended in Palm Springs.

01:00:51.105 --> 01:00:54.608
Well, then, Miss Dionne Warwick,
tell us what town he's from.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.027
All right. Give me your hand.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.614
Oh, Lord.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:02.366
Okay.

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:03.950
I'm not promising anything.

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:08.830
- Are you okay?
- Hmm? Mm.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.544
I see snow.

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:17.839
Lots of snow.

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:19.925
Way up north.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.718
Are we getting hot?

01:01:22.595 --> 01:01:24.304
Yes.

01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:28.308
You live in Alaska...

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:31.436
and the only way in and out
of your place is by plane.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.440
And, uh, you definitely came here
for food and supplies...

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:37.734
and to find a wife.

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:39.653
Wow.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:43.865
- That was right?
- Got goose bumps all over me.

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.659
I'm clairvoyant, butthead.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:49.413
Well, why wouldn't you just go to Nome
to get supplies and a wife?

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.665
- Isn't that a lot closer?
- Yeah, right.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:55.419
That's where you'd go to find girls.
Nome.

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:57.337
He's gay, by the way.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:00.298
Well, good for you.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:03.593
Well, we try.

01:02:03.761 --> 01:02:05.262
Can I ask you some questions?

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.763
Hmm?

01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:10.308
- When did Alaska become a state?
- 1959.

01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.853
Okay, and, uh, who owned it
before we did?

01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:15.814
- Russia.
- And when did we get it from them?

01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:17.691
1867, Seward's Folly.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:22.154
We purchased it for $7.2 million,
a tidy sum then as well as now.

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.406
I'm quoting my father, of course.

01:02:24.615 --> 01:02:27.200
- All right, what's the state capital?
- Juneau.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.828
Hello? It's Anchorage. Gotcha.

01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:32.998
Mm-mm. Sorry, that's the largest city.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.047
Where's he going?

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:44.050
He's going to check your answers
on his computer.

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.719
He has a computer?

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.888
- Sure.
- In the house?

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.056
No, actually, it's in the back yard.

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:53.727
- Of course it's in the house. It's in there.
- May I be excused, please?

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.521
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.112
Aah!

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.490
Who are you?

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:53.119
- I'm the mother.
- It's the mother.

01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:55.747
It's the mother. The mother.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:04:01.294
The mother, the mother, the mother.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:04.047
It's the mother.

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:14.391
Troy, I suppose those tall buildings
we saw this morning are new?

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.810
Yeah. Almost all of them, anyway.

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:20.313
- Recovery's impressive.
- Recovery? Oh, yeah.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.400
Well, you know, they rebuilt
the freeway in only six months.

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:25.151
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:27.320
That's amazing. I'm very impressed.

01:04:27.488 --> 01:04:29.823
- Oh, it was impressive.
- Are you sure I look okay?

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.826
- Oh, trust me, you look fabulous.
- Well, thank you, Troy.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.163
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.334
So, what do you think?

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:44.296
- It works.
- Mm-hm. I should show you...

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:45.839
the entire trousseau.

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:47.966
Shirts, sweaters, socks,
the whole thing.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.343
No. First let's show her these.

01:04:51.512 --> 01:04:53.972
Huh? Eve, can I skate around your block?

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:59.436
How about it, Eve?
Can he skate around your block?

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:01.354
No.

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:05.817
- Just a few laps.
- It won't take long.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:07.819
Ha, ha. No.

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:25.879
Look.

01:05:36.682 --> 01:05:38.642
Adam, will you go skate
on the bike path?

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:42.020
- Where?
- The bike path. It's over there.

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:46.107
God, I wish I could wear those pants.

01:06:08.005 --> 01:06:09.589
Hi.

01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:02.183
Yeah! Ha, ha!

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:08.314
Yeah!

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.283
Y.M.C.A.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:23.121
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:26.958
They have everything
For you men to enjoy

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:29.586
You can hang out with all the boys

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:33.384
Its fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.052
Its fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:41.890
You can get yourself clean
You can have a good meal

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:45.518
You can do whatever you feel

01:07:45.686 --> 01:07:47.520
All right, girl, hit that ball.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:08:01.534
I get it. I finally get it.

01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:04.454
You have to see it to understand it.

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:09.250
Because he must.

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:20.678
Haven't you heard the saying:

01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:23.680
"He hasn't got enough sense
to come in out of the rain"?

01:08:23.849 --> 01:08:24.974
Yep.

01:08:25.142 --> 01:08:29.895
You know, my father,
who is a scientist...

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.564
says that everything is a miracle.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.692
- Yeah?
- Everything.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:38.071
Until recently,
I wasn't sure what he meant by that.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:41.573
No kidding. Listen, uh, you still
wanna go girl hunting tonight?

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:45.411
- Oh, yes, I certainly do.
- Okay.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:48.413
But, you know, this whole business
of finding you a wife...

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:49.832
it's pretty ridiculous.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.919
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.087
A girlfriend, maybe, but a wife, it's...

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:58.049
Well, then help me find a girlfriend.
That's all I ask.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:01.094
I'll tell you what. I'll give you
every single card I've got.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:04.013
Screw you. You think I'm just
somebody you can buy off?

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.600
Oh, no, Eve, I didn't mean that at all.
Eve, you're my best friend.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.270
Would you do it
because you're my very best friend?

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.774
Yeah, okay.

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:21.948
Thank you, Eve.

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:32.876
Well, why did we park way back there?

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:37.296
Miss Rustokov does not allow
total strangers to drive her car.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:40.966
- What?
- Ladies first, Troy.

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.469
- That was close.
- Uh-huh.

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:47.265
My goodness gracious,
this place is something.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.768
- Look unimpressed.
- Yeah, bored, even.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:54.480
Try vaguely bored.

01:09:54.648 --> 01:09:57.734
Unimpressed but still interested.

01:09:59.236 --> 01:10:00.653
- Not crazy.
- Do I look crazy?

01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:04.782
- Yes.
- Just, uh, be loose.

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:06.659
- Yeah.
- Just be yourself.

01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:08.328
Yeah, that's always good advice.

01:10:08.495 --> 01:10:11.289
Well, for him.
It doesn't work for the rest of us.

01:10:14.501 --> 01:10:17.754
Of all the clubs in all the towns
in all the world...

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.464
you walk into mine.

01:10:19.673 --> 01:10:23.760
So welcome to Club 40's,
where the party never stops.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:26.512
Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam.
Adam, that's them.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.847
Hi, how do you do?

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:31.476
It's very nice to meet you,
Jason and Jonathan.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.437
My mother said when you meet
someone for the first time...

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.522
it's easier to remember their names...

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:40.526
if you use those names right away,
Jason and Jonathan.

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:42.654
He's from Alaska.

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:44.864
Oh.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.368
Hi there, Eve. Who's the hunk?

01:10:48.535 --> 01:10:51.287
- Get lost, Sophie.
- Hi, I'm Sophie.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.164
Hi, how do you do? I'm Adam Webber.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.750
- Adam lives in Alaska.
- No shit?

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.756
Oh, you speak beautiful French.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.942
Adam. Adam.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.402
Yeah? Oh, um....

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:27.532
Quit showing off.
We're here on business.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.201
- I thought we were here to meet women.
- Not that one.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.411
I like her.

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:33.705
Tell me, Sophie,
when you fly to Paris...

01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:36.874
do you check these,
or are they carry-on?

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:39.544
- They're carry-on.
- Ah.

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:42.547
Excuse me.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.008
But there's nothin' up my sleeve

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:48.845
But a place to play
Where the people all swing around

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:50.722
What are you drinking?

01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:54.100
Oh, this is a Rob Roy.
It's a very popular drink, I'm told.

01:11:56.770 --> 01:11:58.855
How about her?

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:01.399
- No way.
- No way?

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:03.943
Why not? I think she's very attractive.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:07.280
Adam, she's got "bitch"
written all over her.

01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:10.283
You do know what "bitch" means,
don't you?

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.452
Well, yes, I do. I do have a dictionary.

01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:16.414
But I can't understand for the life of me
why you would say that about her...

01:12:16.623 --> 01:12:19.292
or why Cliff would say that about you.

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:27.133
Okay, uh, Adam, I think for you,
we should aim for sweet.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.469
Okay. I like that.

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:32.472
Yeah, sweet.
That's a lovely way of putting it.

01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.643
There's Miss Sweet, over there
by the hors d'oeuvre table, look.

01:12:37.811 --> 01:12:40.146
Oh, yeah, yeah. Could be.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:44.275
Yeah, go on, Romeo, say hello.
She looks like a non-mutant to me.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:46.652
Okay. All right.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.237
What do I say to her?

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:53.076
Oh, say something surprising,
something funny.

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:54.744
Lie if need be.

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.746
- Lie?
- Oh, yeah.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:13:00.333
Lying can be a very effective
dating tool.

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:05.338
Okay. All right.

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:07.673
Well, here I go.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:11.844
I don't think I wanna watch this.

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:13.763
Surprising and funny.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:16.682
Well, I know a duck
who bought some lip balm.

01:13:17.309 --> 01:13:18.684
Lie.

01:13:20.854 --> 01:13:22.355
Hi.

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.858
- Yes?
- I was wondering if you could help me.

01:13:26.026 --> 01:13:28.194
I, um, seem to have lost...

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:32.198
my Congressional Medal of Honor
around here somewhere.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.451
Ha, ha. Now, that's a great one.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:41.958
- This is my new friend.
- Uh, hi.

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:45.628
- Adam Webber.
- Hi, I'm Heather.

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:47.004
- Heather?
- Yeah.

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:49.882
I don't believe
I've ever heard that name before.

01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:55.847
Yeah, do you dance?

01:13:56.014 --> 01:13:58.391
Why, I took a dance lesson
every day of my life...

01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:00.351
up until a couple of days ago.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.311
- You're kidding.
- No, no, I did.

01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:05.231
Shall we dance?

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:06.732
- Sure.
- Yeah?

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.738
Wait for me.

01:14:44.104 --> 01:14:46.606
He drives a great big car
Smokes a big cigar

01:14:46.773 --> 01:14:49.275
He looks like a king
And he acts like a star

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:51.986
When we see him drive by
He goes "toot, toot"

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.946
We all shout
Hey, Mr. Zoot Suit

01:14:54.114 --> 01:14:56.866
He's got purple suspenders
And a yellow tie

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.911
- Say what?
- Come on, boys, I tell you no lie

01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:01.954
Those hats, those funky spats

01:15:02.122 --> 01:15:04.624
He's the hippest hip and the coolest cat

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:07.168
I tell you no lie
This guy can't be beat

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.337
Wherever he goes
He turns up the heat

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.215
So when you see him drive by
With that big cheroot

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:15.760
Don't forget to shout
Hey, Mr. Zoot Suit!

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.618
I tell you no lie
This guy can't be beat

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:42.995
Wherever he goes
He turns up the heat

01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:45.665
So when you see him drive by
With that big cheroot

01:15:45.832 --> 01:15:48.751
Don't forget to shout
Hey, Mr. Zoot Suit!

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:17.071
Oh.

01:16:21.326 --> 01:16:25.288
- Is that your girlfriend?
- No, no. Will you please excuse me?

01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:28.874
- What are you doing?
- You. You go to the bathroom.

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:31.877
What, right here?
Well, I thought I should check.

01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:33.963
- I mean, you're being so bossy.
- Go.

01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:36.757
- Thank you both for the dance.
- Thank you.

01:16:42.055 --> 01:16:44.724
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:16:45.475 --> 01:16:46.851
Oh.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:50.855
- You wanted to see me?
- You're not from Alaska.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.857
Where did you learn to dance like that?

01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:55.568
And there are no starving people,
are there?

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:57.236
Why are you so angry with me?

01:16:57.404 --> 01:17:00.990
- You think I'm some kind of sap, do you?
- No, I don't.

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:02.408
I admire you.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:04.994
I fell in love with you
the very moment I saw you.

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.079
I want you to stop lying to me.

01:17:08.665 --> 01:17:11.208
All right. I'll tell you everything.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:14.712
- In 1962...
- Well, well, well.

01:17:14.921 --> 01:17:16.297
Don't we clean up nice?

01:17:18.091 --> 01:17:20.217
Well, hello, Cliff.

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:23.262
- How are you this evening?
- Not bad.

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:26.015
Though I, uh, do miss
that green sport coat of yours.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:27.433
Oh, why, thank you, Cliff.

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:29.602
But that's my seat,
and I was just about...

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.437
How about a drink up at the bar?

01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:40.696
Sure.

01:17:40.864 --> 01:17:42.698
Excuse us.

01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:45.117
It's all yours.

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:17.775
- Please excuse this interruption.
- Oh, brother.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:20.986
Eve, I don't mean to be rude,
and, Cliff, please excuse me...

01:18:21.154 --> 01:18:24.156
but, Eve,
isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.825
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:28.744
And legs. Legs, butt and hair.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.080
- And shallow as well?
- Shallow?

01:18:31.289 --> 01:18:32.998
Adam, why don't you go home?

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:36.085
- Go back to the hotel.
- Yeah, before I kick your ass.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:40.297
I must warn you, Cliff,
I do know how to defend myself.

01:18:40.465 --> 01:18:42.091
Oh, do you?

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:44.427
- Agh!
- Stop it, you two.

01:18:44.636 --> 01:18:46.303
Nice move, really.

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:49.473
Yeah, Eve's right.
Maybe we shouldn't fight in here.

01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:51.392
I agree.

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.729
- Ugh.
- Adam.

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:57.273
I'm sorry. He was gonna....

01:18:57.941 --> 01:18:59.483
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.

01:18:59.651 --> 01:19:02.486
I mean, fighting's pretty immature
when you think about it.

01:19:02.654 --> 01:19:06.866
- It certainly is.
- Eve, I'm leaving.

01:19:07.033 --> 01:19:09.535
- That's probably a good idea.
- Eve, I'm sorry.

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.121
- Oh!
- Gah.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:16.834
Well, good night, everyone.

01:19:18.503 --> 01:19:20.463
- Eve...
- I'm leaving too, okay?

01:19:20.672 --> 01:19:21.797
And you know what?

01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:24.049
If you want help, ask Troy,
because I quit.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:29.221
This is ridiculous.
You're ridiculous and I'm ridiculous.

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:35.811
I'll buy you another Rob Roy,
huh, champ?

01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:37.938
Rob Roy for the gentleman.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:45.738
Well?

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.740
He go back to the hotel?

01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:51.160
- Um, he might have.
- What does that mean?

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:53.746
That means
that we did not leave together.

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.372
Well, who did he leave with?

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.501
- What's that to you?
- I'm his pimp.

01:19:58.668 --> 01:20:01.337
He left with those dancers, didn't he?

01:20:02.255 --> 01:20:03.547
You're the psychic.

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:06.884
Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:09.887
- Those sluts.
- Yeah.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.973
Then again,
who isn't a slut these days, huh?

01:20:14.559 --> 01:20:16.227
- Where are you going?
- To bed.

01:20:16.394 --> 01:20:17.853
To bed?

01:20:18.021 --> 01:20:19.897
Sure, to bed.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.441
I'm not the one
that's in love with the guy.

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:24.777
- What? Oh.
- Mm-hm.

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:28.447
Now, hold on. Hold on just a minute.

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:31.367
In the first place,
I do not fall in love with weirdos...

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.702
who I've only known
for four or five days.

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:34.954
Yes, you do.

01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:38.290
And I don't fall in love with grown men
who collect baseball cards.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.542
Yes, you do.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:41.877
Or pee in their pants
when they see the ocean.

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:44.880
- Yes, you do.
- Or have perfect table manners.

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:47.299
You know, I asked him about that.

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:50.386
He said good manners
are just a way of showing people...

01:20:50.554 --> 01:20:52.137
that we have respect for them.

01:20:52.389 --> 01:20:55.516
I didn't know that. I thought
it was a way of acting superior.

01:20:55.725 --> 01:20:58.435
- Oh, you know what else he told me?
- What?

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:01.272
He thinks I'm a gentleman
and you're a lady.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.735
Well... Well, consider the source.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.405
- I don't even know what a lady is.
- I know.

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:12.157
I thought a gentleman
was somebody that owned horses.

01:21:12.325 --> 01:21:16.287
But it turns out the short and simple
definition of a lady or a gentleman...

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.747
is someone who always tries
to make sure...

01:21:18.915 --> 01:21:22.835
the people around him or her
are as comfortable as possible.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.337
Where do you think
he got all that information?

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:28.966
Oh, from the oddest place. His parents.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.468
I mean, I don't think
I got that memo from mine.

01:21:31.678 --> 01:21:34.513
Now I suppose
he's trying to make those dancers...

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:37.349
feel as comfortable as possible.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:40.352
No. He didn't go home with them.

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:47.026
Well....

01:21:47.193 --> 01:21:48.485
He went home with Sophie.

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:52.573
- No!
- Yep.

01:21:52.782 --> 01:21:54.283
No!

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:57.494
She swept him out of the room
whispering French sweet nothings.

01:21:57.662 --> 01:22:00.664
No, not Sophie, not Sophie.
Don't tell me that.

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:03.876
So, what you gonna do,
go to her place and kick the door in?

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:06.670
You're goddamn right I am.

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:11.216
- You coming?
- You kidding? Sophie would kill me.

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:13.719
Oh, coward.

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:16.221
Gentleman coward.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:32.112
Eve!

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:37.242
So scare me, why don't you?
You stupid son of a bitch.

01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:40.245
- I'm really sorry.
- What are you doing here?

01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:42.748
You're supposed to be
on San Vicente Boulevard...

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.626
having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:49.755
- I know, and I'm really sorry.
- I'm limping.

01:22:50.006 --> 01:22:52.508
How attractive is that?
What if this is for life?

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.677
- Adam.
- Where the hell are those bandages?

01:22:54.844 --> 01:22:56.762
- I was just gonna say...
- I know.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:59.098
- And then she went, "Aah" and she....
- I know.

01:22:59.265 --> 01:23:01.767
- I didn't mean to scare her.
- Of course you didn't.

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:04.103
Nothing I do with her
ever seems to be right.

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.605
Used to be up here with the coffee.
Why don't...?

01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:10.109
That's because you're a nice boy...

01:23:10.276 --> 01:23:13.195
but what Eve needs is a nice man.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.865
Understand, champ? Good night.

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:19.034
Night, Troy.

01:23:19.452 --> 01:23:20.577
You still here?

01:23:20.745 --> 01:23:22.371
- Let me help.
- I can do it myself.

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:25.124
I know more about first aid
than you know about cards.

01:23:25.291 --> 01:23:28.961
Give me the stuff and sit down. Sit.

01:23:30.755 --> 01:23:33.549
Let me see. Give me your knee.

01:23:35.301 --> 01:23:38.262
- These pants are ruined, right?
- I'd say so.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:39.930
There.

01:23:45.645 --> 01:23:48.063
- Aah.... Ouch.
- Steady.

01:23:48.481 --> 01:23:53.152
- There. And don't be such a baby.
- Oh, I'm the baby?

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.201
Um....

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:03.996
Did, um...?

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:07.791
Did you go to Sophie's?

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:10.335
Of course.

01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:13.672
And?

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:17.760
- She was hospitable.
- Hospitable?

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:19.845
Huh.

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:26.852
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be.

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:32.608
So I left as politely as I could,
and I found a taxi...

01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:36.820
and I told the driver to bring me here
instead of back to the hotel.

01:24:40.366 --> 01:24:43.827
There is a song that Mr. Como sings...

01:24:43.995 --> 01:24:45.954
called "On the Street Where You Live."

01:24:46.122 --> 01:24:47.623
Do you know it?

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:50.626
Sing it to me.

01:24:53.838 --> 01:24:55.714
Um....

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:59.968
I have often walked
Down this street before

01:25:00.136 --> 01:25:05.140
But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before

01:25:05.308 --> 01:25:10.938
All at once am I
Several stories high

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:16.401
Knowing I'm on the street
Where you live

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:22.699
It's a song about a young man
who's overjoyed...

01:25:24.577 --> 01:25:26.870
just to be standing
in front of the house...

01:25:27.997 --> 01:25:33.168
of the person that he loves.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:50.561
Adam, you know, I...

01:25:58.528 --> 01:26:04.408
Adam, I know this is stupid,
but humor me.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.705
Have you ever had sex before?

01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:13.876
No.

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:18.547
How is that possible?

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:21.383
You better sit back down.

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:27.806
In 1962, when the bomb
was dropped on Los Angeles...

01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:30.809
my parents were in our fallout shelter.

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:32.227
That's where I was born.

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:35.981
We only survived
because it's a huge shelter...

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:39.067
as far as fallout shelters go.

01:26:39.235 --> 01:26:42.821
My father worked on it secretly
for years.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:46.283
When he had to, he used contractors,
but always from out of state...

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.660
and always for only a portion
of the job.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:51.330
He told them it was a
secret government experiment...

01:26:51.497 --> 01:26:52.748
done through Caltech.

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:54.291
Now, my dad's not a liar...

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:57.002
but in this case,
he felt he had no choice.

01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:59.338
Of course, it had to be kept a secret.

01:26:59.505 --> 01:27:03.508
We only had enough supplies
to last three people for 35 years.

01:27:03.676 --> 01:27:06.011
The really tricky part
was the air-vent system...

01:27:06.179 --> 01:27:09.681
but we were finally able
to cut into the flood-control sewer....

01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:17.356
Eve, what I would like to do...

01:27:17.523 --> 01:27:20.192
is to take you with me
down into the fallout shelter.

01:27:21.027 --> 01:27:24.029
We could live there with my mom and dad.

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:27.324
My dad said
that if I found a healthy young girl...

01:27:27.492 --> 01:27:29.826
that I should bring her on down.

01:27:30.453 --> 01:27:32.371
Why, Eve...

01:27:33.289 --> 01:27:36.625
you look plenty healthy to me.

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:43.215
- Adam?
- Yes, Eve?

01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:47.886
I think it's time to call a cab.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:52.057
Oh. Of course. You're absolutely right.

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:55.644
I really shouldn't be over here
at this late hour.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:27:59.940
Mm-hm.

01:28:04.153 --> 01:28:06.071
Good night, Adam.

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.704
Thank you.

01:28:31.222 --> 01:28:34.725
- Goddamn, Adam.
- Wait a minute.

01:28:35.893 --> 01:28:37.602
Oh, look, I'm sorry.

01:28:37.770 --> 01:28:40.522
I know, I took the Lord's name
in vain again. I...

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:43.734
No. There's an adult bookstore
back there.

01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:45.902
I'll be right back.

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:00.625
Give us a sign.

01:29:00.793 --> 01:29:01.835
- Amen.
- Yeah.

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.211
- That's all we ask.
- Amen.

01:29:03.379 --> 01:29:06.631
- Just give us some sort of sign.
- Amen.

01:29:06.799 --> 01:29:11.762
- Just show us that we're not alone.
- Yeah.

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.453
Hi, Eve.

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:40.499
- Hi, Adam. This is....
- Hi, Adam, I'm Nina Aron.

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:43.627
- Hello, how do you do?
- Very well, thank you.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:46.171
I'm with the county
Family Services Department.

01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:51.134
Eve tells me you've been living
in a bomb shelter most of your life.

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:55.847
Fallout shelter. There is a difference.

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:59.935
Adam, I'd like to introduce you
to my associate, Mr. Brown.

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:02.687
Hello.

01:30:03.689 --> 01:30:05.190
We want you to come with us...

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:07.859
so we can talk some more
about your experiences.

01:30:08.027 --> 01:30:10.695
- Come where?
- My office.

01:30:10.863 --> 01:30:12.697
For how long?

01:30:12.865 --> 01:30:14.658
Well, that depends.

01:30:14.867 --> 01:30:17.202
Well, I thank you very much
for the invitation...

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:18.703
but I'm very busy today.

01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:23.166
- Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
- I think you should go with Dr. Aron.

01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:26.670
I think it's the best thing.

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.048
I think it's the best thing
for you, I do.

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:37.389
All right, Eve, if you say so.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.976
I do.

01:30:42.979 --> 01:30:44.479
Could I please just go home?

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:47.065
I was lost,
but I found home this morning.

01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:51.862
And if I can just go home, I promise
I'll never bother any of you ever again.

01:30:52.071 --> 01:30:55.407
Adam, uh, let's go talk first.

01:30:59.036 --> 01:31:01.997
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

01:31:04.917 --> 01:31:06.126
Bye, Adam.

01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:09.588
Bye, Troy.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:20.390
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Oh, yes.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:25.604
What? What was I supposed to do?

01:31:25.771 --> 01:31:27.898
He told me he wanted
to take me underground.

01:31:28.065 --> 01:31:31.443
That's like Silence of the Lambs.
It's crazy.

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:34.362
Yeah. You did the right thing.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.243
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, no.

01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:41.703
Where you going?

01:31:43.539 --> 01:31:45.290
- Oh, my God.
- All right, don't worry.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:48.585
Don't worry, he'll catch him.
Yes, this is Nina Aron.

01:31:48.794 --> 01:31:51.463
I've got a runaway,
and I'm gonna need police assistance.

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:54.049
- No, you cannot call them.
- Young lady, I have to.

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:56.468
If a complaint is made
and the person resists...

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:57.928
No, I cannot have that.

01:31:58.137 --> 01:32:00.764
They'll come with their cars
and their guns and...

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:02.557
All right, all right. Calm down.

01:32:02.725 --> 01:32:05.977
Now, that young man needs help,
and you need protection from him.

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.312
I was frightened.

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:11.983
I didn't know what to think,
but, you know, I believe him.

01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:13.443
I think he just...

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:16.988
I do. I really think he just wants
to go home, wherever that might be.

01:32:17.156 --> 01:32:20.575
All right, everybody has to calm down.
That's the most important thing.

01:32:20.743 --> 01:32:22.327
- Eve. Here's my hotel key.
- Adam.

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:25.413
You can have my baseball cards.
Don't forget to pay my bill.

01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:28.667
You stop right there.
Stop. Don't get in that truck.

01:32:28.834 --> 01:32:31.503
Adam, you gotta stop
trying to drive this truck.

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:32.796
- Bye, Troy.
- Bye, Adam.

01:32:32.964 --> 01:32:34.464
Thanks for always being happy.

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:36.841
- What?
- Gay.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.596
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:44.599
That's my car, you son of a bitch!

01:32:45.184 --> 01:32:47.686
- Where the hell have you been?
- I fell down.

01:32:47.853 --> 01:32:50.021
You guys get the license number
on that truck?

01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:53.108
What are you asking them for?
They're as screwed up as he is.

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:55.527
Everybody keep calm.
That's the important thing.

01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:57.362
Who you talking to, you stupid...?

01:32:57.530 --> 01:32:59.739
- Eve! Eve!
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.501
Mom? Dad? I'm home.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:15.088
Oh! Oh.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:17.632
Adam. Oh, Adam.

01:33:18.676 --> 01:33:21.219
- Oh.
- I've got almost everything we need.

01:33:21.387 --> 01:33:24.389
- And this nice man...
- Archbishop Melker.

01:33:24.557 --> 01:33:25.974
We met previously.

01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:28.893
...and his church group volunteered
to help bring it down.

01:33:29.145 --> 01:33:31.813
- But we've gotta hurry.
- Are you in trouble, son?

01:33:31.981 --> 01:33:34.357
I think I'm being chased
by a psychiatrist.

01:33:34.525 --> 01:33:36.818
- A psychiatrist?
- It happens.

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:40.530
Oh, my goodness. How bad is it up there?

01:33:41.073 --> 01:33:42.741
Horrible.

01:33:44.368 --> 01:33:46.494
There's something on your forehead.

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:49.289
- Calvin.
- I know.

01:34:09.352 --> 01:34:11.770
Okay.

01:34:26.202 --> 01:34:27.285
Is this it?

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:35.794
- Well, what are we gonna do with it?
- Give it back to him.

01:34:35.961 --> 01:34:38.421
- And what if we can't find him?
- We'll find him.

01:34:38.589 --> 01:34:40.215
Well....

01:35:00.444 --> 01:35:02.904
Hey, Eve.

01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:07.951
Eve, uh, look what I found in the suitcase.
It's stock certificates.

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:09.327
I mean, it's got, like...

01:35:09.495 --> 01:35:13.498
It's got, like, IBM and AT&T
and Polaroid and....

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:17.252
Ipana? I remember this brand.

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:19.754
I didn't know they still made this.

01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:27.637
Oh. Look at this.
It says, "Trademark 1961."

01:35:31.642 --> 01:35:33.768
Hurry, my friends,
we have no time to waste.

01:35:33.936 --> 01:35:36.646
The son has spoken. Let's step it up.

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:40.775
Leave my elevator alone.
Leave my elevator alone.

01:35:40.943 --> 01:35:43.528
We're losing the light.

01:35:43.779 --> 01:35:47.615
Purchased in 1958 and '59?
Ten thousand shares of each?

01:35:47.783 --> 01:35:49.534
- Mm-hm.
- They'd be worth millions.

01:35:49.702 --> 01:35:52.787
Hell, I don't know.
Millions upon millions...

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:54.706
Upon millions.

01:35:55.124 --> 01:36:01.004
The stocks, the baseball cards,
the clothes, the toothpaste.

01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:03.173
The guy's on the level.

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:05.383
Eve.

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:09.679
Eve, a man walks into your life
who's the kindest, most polite...

01:36:09.847 --> 01:36:11.890
most incredibly rich guy
you've ever met.

01:36:12.057 --> 01:36:14.392
And I have him committed.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:17.812
Yes. Yes, you did.

01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:19.898
Yeah.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.486
Well, at least I fell for him
before I found out he was rich.

01:36:24.653 --> 01:36:27.322
- That's new.
- Yeah.

01:36:28.657 --> 01:36:33.244
He said today he knew where home was.
Where'd you guys go this morning?

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:36.414
Just to pick up frozen poultry.

01:36:36.582 --> 01:36:39.375
- Then?
- Then back to the house.

01:36:39.543 --> 01:36:41.753
You didn't stop anywhere?

01:36:44.006 --> 01:36:46.591
We did. We stopped at a porn shop.

01:36:47.092 --> 01:36:50.595
We stopped at this adult bookstore.
Adam was very excited to see it.

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:54.724
- Adam was very excited to see porn?
- Yes.

01:36:54.892 --> 01:36:57.769
Eve, do you think maybe his home...

01:36:57.978 --> 01:37:01.189
is underneath a dirty bookstore
in the Valley?

01:37:06.445 --> 01:37:09.906
- Is this it?
- Yeah. Yeah, this is the place.

01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:32.887
Harder. Adam? Adam?

01:37:34.306 --> 01:37:36.891
Um, heh. Do you have a basement?

01:37:37.059 --> 01:37:41.312
Believe me, all the really good stuff
is right up front.

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:44.774
Is there a back entrance or something?

01:37:44.984 --> 01:37:46.943
Are you kidding? Of course.

01:37:47.152 --> 01:37:49.654
Nice kid. Nice kid.

01:37:51.782 --> 01:37:54.659
What are we looking for?
This is ridiculous.

01:37:54.827 --> 01:37:57.453
Why would they put a fallout shelter
under a porn shop?

01:37:57.621 --> 01:37:59.289
None of this was here back in '62.

01:37:59.456 --> 01:38:01.833
Back then this was all, like,
cute little homes...

01:38:02.001 --> 01:38:04.752
and, you know, fruit orchards.

01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:07.547
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:12.594
- I wanna go home.
- Yeah. Maybe he'll call, huh?

01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:15.930
Uh, Eve?

01:38:16.098 --> 01:38:17.849
This is Adam.

01:38:18.684 --> 01:38:22.145
Look, I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did for me.

01:38:22.313 --> 01:38:25.857
And I wanted to tell you that I....

01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:28.526
That, uh....

01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:31.029
That I wish so many good things for you.

01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:34.699
I wish so hard
that all of your dreams come true.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:36.951
And that...

01:38:37.119 --> 01:38:40.371
And that's all I... And that's all.

01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:09.108
Surprise. Bang! Ha-ha-ha.

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:14.864
Stay out of here, you drunk.

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:20.078
Mm-mm-mm.

01:39:40.349 --> 01:39:42.016
Adam?

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:25.101
- How long you gonna set it for this time?
- I thought 10 years.

01:40:25.477 --> 01:40:30.314
Well, it's considerably shorter
than before...

01:40:30.816 --> 01:40:34.485
but I was wondering, Calvin,
I mean, why set the locks at all?

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:36.112
I mean, the radiation's gone.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.990
To keep what's up there
from getting down here.

01:40:39.158 --> 01:40:42.201
It's not radiation I'm worried about.

01:40:42.578 --> 01:40:44.245
Mom. Dad.

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.000
Oh, ho.

01:40:54.465 --> 01:40:57.633
I would like for you to meet
Miss Eve Rustokov.

01:40:57.801 --> 01:40:59.969
- Mrs. Webber.
- Hello.

01:41:00.137 --> 01:41:01.846
- Mr. Webber.
- Hello.

01:41:02.514 --> 01:41:05.433
Adam's told me
such wonderful things about you.

01:41:06.018 --> 01:41:08.102
Oh, well, excuse us, please.

01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:12.190
- We haven't entertained a guest in...
- Quite some time.

01:41:12.357 --> 01:41:15.193
Oh, Eve, what can I offer you?

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:18.863
- Mom, Eve and I have to go.
- Oh, Adam, you just got here.

01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:22.366
I can't explain now, but I want you
to set the locks for two months.

01:41:22.534 --> 01:41:25.620
You've got enough of everything.
We'll be right back to get you.

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:27.747
But I don't understand.

01:41:27.956 --> 01:41:31.125
And I'm asking you to trust me
without understanding why.

01:41:31.335 --> 01:41:34.879
- In that case, of course.
- Of course, son.

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:38.341
- They really are wonderful parents.
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:41.886
Oh, Adam.
Could you at least stay for dinner?

01:41:42.054 --> 01:41:44.764
- Well, we do....
- You must.

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:48.935
Perfect.

01:41:49.103 --> 01:41:51.020
Now, tell me if you've heard this one.

01:41:51.188 --> 01:41:53.356
Duck walks into a drugstore.

01:41:53.524 --> 01:41:58.486
This gravy is an old favorite of Calvin's.
Now, Eve, the platter is down there.

01:41:58.654 --> 01:42:00.696
Would you get that, honey?

01:42:00.864 --> 01:42:04.951
The sperm swims toward the egg. Pop.

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.577
- Into the egg.
- But why?

01:42:06.745 --> 01:42:08.329
Because it must.

01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:13.084
- But why?
- Because it's out there.

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:17.421
I don't mean to be nosy,
but are you and Adam dating?

01:42:17.589 --> 01:42:19.632
Yeah, we are.

01:42:21.093 --> 01:42:24.053
And I'm from Pasadena.

01:42:27.432 --> 01:42:30.935
And you thought your parents were weird.

01:42:31.937 --> 01:42:35.273
It's truly amazing what you can get
done when you have unlimited funds.

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:39.610
Do you know you can have whole
houses built in just a matter of months?

01:42:39.778 --> 01:42:42.196
It's like the Garden of Eden,
don't you think?

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:45.158
All you have to say is this:
"I don't care what it costs."

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:48.452
Of course, you've gotta really mean it,
which no one ever does.

01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.664
It took a while
to convince Archbishop Melker...

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:53.207
that Adam wasn't God...

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:55.751
and he was pretty broken up
about it too.

01:42:55.919 --> 01:42:59.839
Until I showed him my plans
for Los Angeles' hottest nightspot.

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.299
It's my goddamn malt shop.

01:43:01.466 --> 01:43:03.968
- Let's figure out what's gonna happen.
- Okay.

01:43:04.136 --> 01:43:07.471
Now, I want the whole ownership
of everything downstairs, all right?

01:43:07.639 --> 01:43:10.433
- Well...
- I want one of my guys at the door.

01:43:13.353 --> 01:43:17.857
Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
up to the surface very slowly...

01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:21.360
make them very comfortable,
and then break the bad news to them...

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:24.822
that there was no nuclear holocaust.

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.338
Oh, Adam.

01:43:52.684 --> 01:43:55.019
Oh, son.

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:03.444
Okay. And here you go. Careful.

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:11.827
It's hot.

01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:13.537
Careful.

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:21.087
Have you ever in your life seen a son
who did more for his parents?

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.507
This is beautiful.

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:28.719
- It's absolutely beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:44:28.887 --> 01:44:34.517
Well, we seem to have everything,
but, you know...

01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:39.230
it's not much different
from the fallout shelter.

01:44:40.065 --> 01:44:44.610
No, Calvin, this is different,
believe me.

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:52.159
This is great, son.

01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:56.539
By the way....

01:44:57.874 --> 01:45:02.461
Eve, her last name, Rustokov,
that's not Russian, is it?

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:05.673
No, it's, uh, Ukrainian.
Her grandparents immigrated.

01:45:09.928 --> 01:45:11.887
Dad, I don't know
how to tell you this...

01:45:12.055 --> 01:45:15.182
and I was gonna wait for a while
to do it, but, um....

01:45:17.728 --> 01:45:21.480
Dad, there was no bomb.
A plane crashed in our back yard.

01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:24.358
I looked it up in old newspapers.

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:27.320
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:30.406
The Soviet Union collapsed
without a shot being fired.

01:45:30.574 --> 01:45:32.074
The Cold War's over.

01:45:35.954 --> 01:45:38.414
That's what everyone believes?

01:45:38.582 --> 01:45:40.374
Oh, yes, sir.

01:45:40.542 --> 01:45:42.001
And it's true.

01:45:43.211 --> 01:45:47.465
What, the Politburo one day said:

01:45:48.216 --> 01:45:50.968
"We give up"? Ha-ha-ha.

01:45:51.762 --> 01:45:54.221
Yes, that's kind of how it went.

01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:57.600
My gosh, those commies are brilliant.

01:45:57.768 --> 01:45:59.643
You have to hand it to them.

01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:02.480
"No, we didn't drop any bombs.

01:46:02.647 --> 01:46:06.817
Oh, yeah, our evil empire has collapsed.
Poor us."

01:46:06.985 --> 01:46:11.155
I'll bet they even asked the West
for aid.

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:12.656
Right?

01:46:12.824 --> 01:46:15.368
Um, I think they did.

01:46:15.577 --> 01:46:18.829
Oh, boys. Dinnertime.

01:46:18.997 --> 01:46:20.081
Pot roast.

01:46:25.253 --> 01:46:26.921
I'll tell you.

01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:30.800
Funny guy.

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:34.678
- Don't tell your mother.
- No, okay.

01:46:34.846 --> 01:46:38.015
Adam says that
this is simply how things work.

01:46:38.183 --> 01:46:40.518
First the parents
take care of the children...

01:46:40.685 --> 01:46:43.270
and then the children
take care of the parents.

01:46:43.438 --> 01:46:46.524
He says historically,
that's how it works.

01:46:46.691 --> 01:46:49.193
Damn commies.

01:46:52.489 --> 01:46:56.700
Whenever Adam gives me
such obviously incorrect information...

01:46:56.868 --> 01:47:01.831
I just smile, slap him on the knee,
and look out the window.

01:47:01.998 --> 01:47:03.374
Why spoil his dreams?

01:47:04.292 --> 01:47:07.503
They're such wonderful dreams.
