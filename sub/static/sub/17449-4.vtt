WEBVTT

00:02.125 --> 00:03.458
Wow!

00:03.542 --> 00:05.542
Check out the hero's welcome
we're getting for restoring

00:05.625 --> 00:07.667
all those superheroes'
powers yesterday.

00:09.709 --> 00:10.750
No one's
even looking at us.

00:12.834 --> 00:13.917
Exactly.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.875
That's the highest
form of flattery.

00:15.959 --> 00:18.875
They feel unworthy to even
set eyes on such greatness.

00:19.792 --> 00:21.291
Jeez.
Enough praise.

00:21.375 --> 00:22.834
You're embarrassing me.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.542
We are pretty awesome.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.792
Hey, we should document
our heroism.

00:31.041 --> 00:35.291
Dear future generations
of people and/or cyborgs,

00:35.375 --> 00:37.792
yesterday humanity was saved
from the forces of evil

00:37.875 --> 00:39.959
and you may be wondering
who did it.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.125
Look no further.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.333
It was yours truly,
Oliver.

00:43.417 --> 00:46.625
And yours truly,
Kazimieras.

00:46.709 --> 00:47.917
Kazimieras?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.792
Yeah.
That's my real name.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.709
But I go by Kaz because
nobody can spell Kazimieras.

00:52.792 --> 00:53.875
Especially me.

00:53.959 --> 00:56.083
K-A-Z-I, K-A-Z-E.

00:56.166 --> 00:57.417
It's impossible!

00:58.792 --> 01:00.792
I've known you
since we were three.

01:00.875 --> 01:02.333
How could you
never have told me that?

01:02.417 --> 01:03.583
What's the big deal?

01:03.667 --> 01:05.542
There are hundreds of secrets
I've kept from you.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.417
Like the fact that
I've been stealing the meat

01:08.500 --> 01:11.083
out of your sandwiches
every day for five years.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.792
I wondered why my mom was always
making me cheese sandwiches.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.917
Sometimes
it was only bread!

01:28.500 --> 01:29.709
My point is,

01:29.792 --> 01:31.875
best friends do not keep
secrets from each other.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.834
Unlike you, Skylar doesn't keep
any secrets from me.

01:34.917 --> 01:36.041
Right, Skylar?

01:36.125 --> 01:37.959
Uh, right.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.291
I would never keep
anything from you.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.250
Shame on you, Kaz.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.959
Shame. On. You.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.000
(alarm buzzing)

01:49.083 --> 01:50.500
Neocortex!

01:50.583 --> 01:52.875
-What's wrong?
-Oh, no.

01:52.959 --> 01:55.041
Something bad always happens
whenever I get treated

01:55.125 --> 01:57.250
by you two guys.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.667
First of all,
it's Doctor You-Two-Guys,

02:00.750 --> 02:02.583
and she's already
treating those two guys.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.417
Fine.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.291
I was attacked by Spark Plug
and the Silver Shield.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.083
What?
But they're superheroes.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.667
Why would
they attack you?

02:13.750 --> 02:15.667
Because you roll your eyes
and sigh at everyone?

02:15.750 --> 02:18.458
(sighs) No, I do not.

02:19.583 --> 02:22.709
Anyway, I read their minds
right before Spark Plug

02:22.792 --> 02:24.166
shorted out my powers.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.083
They're both working
for the Annihilator now.

02:27.041 --> 02:28.208
(Oliver) Oh, no!

02:28.291 --> 02:29.667
Do you know
what this means?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.125
The new Spark Plug movie
needs a quick rewrite?

02:33.458 --> 02:36.083
No, Spark Plug
and the Silver Shield

02:36.166 --> 02:38.667
were both
at Mighty Med yesterday.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.041
Maybe there's a mole here
who's secretly working

02:41.125 --> 02:43.458
with the Annihilator
and turning superheroes evil!

02:43.542 --> 02:44.458
Ugh.

02:44.542 --> 02:47.000
Some people.
Shame on them.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.417
Shame. On. Them.

02:51.875 --> 02:53.208
I know who it is.

02:53.291 --> 02:56.000
It's so obvious. She's standing
right in front of us.

02:57.458 --> 02:58.875
It's Mesmera!

02:59.917 --> 03:02.291
She's wearing
an eye patch!

03:04.250 --> 03:07.750
The only people who wear
eye patches are villains.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.375
Or patients being
treated for pink eye...

I called Agent Blaylock
an hour ago to fill him in.

04:06.709 --> 04:07.667
What's taking him so long?

04:07.750 --> 04:09.208
We don't need him.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.542
We'll figure out
who the mole is ourselves.

04:11.625 --> 04:15.417
Now these are the superheroes
who turned evil,

04:15.500 --> 04:17.291
whose powers were
in the Annihilator's lair.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.709
These are the superheroes
who turned evil

04:19.792 --> 04:22.000
who were recently treated
at Mighty Med,

04:22.083 --> 04:24.875
and these are the superheroes
who owe me money.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.834
You loaned money
to High Roller?

04:28.917 --> 04:30.625
He's got a huge
gambling problem.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.417
He's never gonna pay you back!

04:32.500 --> 04:34.041
He better.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.291
This grease board
was expensive.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.041
What's that?

04:40.125 --> 04:42.709
It's The Beginner's Guide
to Turning Superheroes Evil.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.250
I thought it might
give us some insight.

04:44.333 --> 04:47.709
Oh, and check it out,
Crimson Demon wrote a review:

04:47.792 --> 04:49.542
"A must read.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.166
Seriously, read this
or I'll burn your face off."

04:54.667 --> 04:56.083
(panting)

04:56.166 --> 04:58.625
Agent Blaylock!
Why are you so winded?

04:58.709 --> 05:01.291
I ran all the way here
from my office!

05:01.375 --> 05:03.125
How far away is it?

05:03.208 --> 05:05.208
On the other side
of that wall.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.125
But the floor slopes
uphill a little,

05:08.208 --> 05:10.583
and I had pancakes
for lunch and...

05:10.667 --> 05:13.041
Heck, I don't have to
explain myself to you!

05:14.333 --> 05:15.375
Now what do you need?

05:15.458 --> 05:17.667
Look, superheroes
are turning evil,

05:17.750 --> 05:18.750
and we know
there's a mole.

05:18.834 --> 05:20.208
You think I don't know
what's happening?

05:20.291 --> 05:21.417
I'm on it.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.750
So you two guys
mind your own business.

05:23.834 --> 05:26.625
He was talking to us,
Dr. You-Two-Guys.

05:28.917 --> 05:30.917
Now I have to go all the way
back to my office.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.834
Luckily, it's downhill
on the way back.

05:36.625 --> 05:37.792
Wait.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.333
I just figured out
who the mole is.

05:39.417 --> 05:41.417
Who at Mighty Med
has the strongest motive

05:41.500 --> 05:42.959
to betray
the superhero world?

05:43.041 --> 05:44.792
I give up.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.500
You didn't even try.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.583
It's Alan.

05:48.667 --> 05:49.917
What?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.834
No way.
Think about it.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.375
Who is
totally power hungry,

05:53.458 --> 05:55.709
and who brought the Dyad of
Nebulon to Wallace and Clyde?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.041
I give up.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.583
Alan!

05:59.667 --> 06:00.917
You are terrible at this!

06:02.333 --> 06:03.458
Wait, no.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.375
It couldn't
possibly be Alan,

06:05.458 --> 06:06.959
because he doesn't wear
an eye patch.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.625
I'm telling you,
Alan's a mole.

06:10.709 --> 06:12.000
He's not a mole.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.917
I'm a mole!

06:17.000 --> 06:20.583
Alan...
what the heck?

06:20.667 --> 06:23.834
I got scared and turned
partway into a mole.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.667
By the way, be careful
by the cafeteria.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.250
I made a molehill.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.583
Then I made
a mountain out of it.

06:30.959 --> 06:33.041
Okay, that doesn't prove
that Alan's the mole.

06:33.125 --> 06:35.250
Hey, check out
what Mesmera gave me.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.000
Okay, now that proves it.

06:55.959 --> 06:58.083
I don't know why you
signaled me to bring you here.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.709
I can do this myself.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.750
I know, but I needed
a change of scenery.

07:02.834 --> 07:04.709
Yeah, there's too much
black in your prison cell.

07:04.792 --> 07:08.166
Your suit is black, the walls are black.
It's depressing!

07:08.250 --> 07:10.166
Our plan
is working perfectly.

07:10.250 --> 07:11.959
Once you turn
Blue Tornado evil,

07:12.041 --> 07:14.709
he'll be the latest hero
to join my army of villains.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.625
There is
one small problem.

07:16.709 --> 07:18.834
Kaz and Oliver know
there's a mole in the hospital.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.500
Then you need to do something
to throw them off our scent.

07:21.583 --> 07:22.667
(Horace)
I'm up the hallway.

07:22.750 --> 07:23.709
Someone's coming!
Quick!

07:23.792 --> 07:25.000
Go back
through the portal!

07:28.917 --> 07:30.834
(grunting)

07:35.333 --> 07:36.792
Horace!

07:36.875 --> 07:38.542
Why, hello!

07:42.875 --> 07:44.917
Skylar,
I'm glad I ran into you.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.709
Now that you've had
your powers restored,

07:46.792 --> 07:47.667
I need to run some tests

07:47.750 --> 07:49.125
to make sure
they're working properly.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.667
The last thing you need is
to try to capture a villain

07:51.750 --> 07:52.750
using your super-speed

07:52.834 --> 07:55.250
only to shoot fire
out of your ears instead.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.792
Although that would be
hilarious.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.166
Uhh!

08:06.000 --> 08:07.834
You look different.

08:07.917 --> 08:09.834
Were you wearing
a top hat a minute ago?

08:10.834 --> 08:12.000
Um, no.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.959
Too bad.

08:14.041 --> 08:15.250
I was gonna ask
to borrow it.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.792
I love top hats!

08:17.875 --> 08:19.834
Bottom hats are the worst.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.834
Anyway, I should run
those tests now.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.709
Do we really need to?

08:25.792 --> 08:26.792
I'm kind of busy.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.792
And all my powers
are working fine.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.250
Watch.

08:33.917 --> 08:34.959
Explode!

08:35.917 --> 08:37.834
See?
I'm fine.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.291
So we good?

08:39.375 --> 08:41.583
I guess.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.792
Well, what's wrong?

08:43.875 --> 08:46.959
To be honest, I was
kind of hoping for fire

08:47.041 --> 08:48.709
to shoot
out of your ears.

09:07.917 --> 09:10.834
I'm telling you, I'm not the mole.
I'm innocent!

09:10.917 --> 09:13.083
If you're innocent,
why are you squirming?

09:13.166 --> 09:15.250
Because of that spotlight
in my face!

09:15.333 --> 09:17.208
Okay, Spotlight,
get out of his face.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.375
We're going to get the truth
out of you eventually.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.750
There's no use
keeping secrets.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.083
Funny you should be talking
about not keeping secrets,

09:27.166 --> 09:28.667
Kazimieras.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.125
If that is your real name.

09:30.208 --> 09:33.750
Yeah, that is my real name.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.041
Look, you're being
too soft on Alan.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.875
Let me handle this.

09:38.959 --> 09:41.000
All right, punk,

09:41.083 --> 09:44.792
we can do this the easy way,
or we can do this the hard way.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.709
I take it
that was the hard way.

09:58.792 --> 09:59.875
Quiet!

10:03.458 --> 10:05.166
(pants ripping)

10:05.250 --> 10:07.375
Did you just
rip your pants?

10:07.458 --> 10:09.166
No.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.750
I know who the mole is.

10:13.834 --> 10:17.542
I searched every nook
and cranny in this hospital,

10:17.625 --> 10:19.667
and also on this
English muffin.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.750
Mmm-mm-mm!

10:21.834 --> 10:23.000
Mmm!

10:23.083 --> 10:24.709
I already know
who the mole is.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.959
Of course you do,
because it's you!

10:27.959 --> 10:28.917
What?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.417
Ha!

10:30.500 --> 10:31.834
You knew
it was Oliver?

10:31.917 --> 10:33.875
No, I just figured out
the punchline of a joke

10:33.959 --> 10:35.750
I was told
three years ago.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.750
You're working
with the Annihilator?

10:39.834 --> 10:41.834
Talk about
keeping secrets,

10:41.917 --> 10:43.458
I don't even know
what to say.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.125
But I do know
what to do.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.333
(Together)
Oh, yeah. He did it.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.125
Look, I swear,
I'm not the mole!

10:59.208 --> 11:01.000
I know it's you,
Oliver.

11:01.083 --> 11:02.917
I searched every locker
in Mighty Med,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.792
and guess
what I found in yours?

11:04.875 --> 11:06.375
I give up.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.625
You didn't even try!

11:10.667 --> 11:12.166
I found this device.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.792
You use this to turn
superheroes evil.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.834
Shame on you
Oliver.

11:16.917 --> 11:19.583
Shame. On. You.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.750
I have no idea
how this got in my locker!

11:22.834 --> 11:24.959
Look, someone must be
trying to frame me!

11:25.041 --> 11:28.041
Then why did
I also find this?

11:28.125 --> 11:32.166
The Beginner's Guide
to Turning Superheroes Evil.

11:32.250 --> 11:35.417
That is my book, but I was reading it
to figure out who the mole is.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.875
And it's Alan!

11:36.959 --> 11:40.000
Alan wasn't even in Mighty Med
when the crimes occurred.

11:40.083 --> 11:41.917
And he's not smart enough
to have done this.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.333
The boy is dumb as dirt.

11:43.417 --> 11:45.709
Thank you.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.208
Wait...

11:50.917 --> 11:54.250
And how do you explain
this confession signed by you?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.417
Hold on, this isn't
Oliver's handwriting.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.458
Whoever wrote this dotted
the 'i's with hearts.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.166
Oliver dots his 'i's with stars.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.041
Yeah, because stars are cool.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.500
Hearts are for girls.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.750
He was right. Someone did
plant this stuff in his locker.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.709
Please, just give us some time
to clear his name.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.458
I'll tell you what.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.625
Since it's time
for my end-of-the-day nap,

12:19.709 --> 12:21.375
I'll give you till I wake up.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.375
So you have 12 hours.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.709
Hello, Skylar.

12:41.709 --> 12:44.041
Try doing that
with a bottom hat.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.667
What are you doing
in Neocortex's room?

12:48.750 --> 12:52.125
(stammering) I heard he wasn't eating
his canned peaches,

12:52.208 --> 12:54.750
and...they're my favorite.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.041
Mmm.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.959
They're so good.

13:01.834 --> 13:03.417
Those are his tonsils.

13:06.333 --> 13:09.375
Anyway, I need you
to complete this paperwork

13:09.458 --> 13:10.917
before you check out
of the hospital.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.959
Wait. What do you mean, check out?
I have to leave?

13:15.041 --> 13:18.917
Well, there's no reason for you to stay
since your powers are all working fine.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.583
So just sign these papers

13:21.667 --> 13:23.583
and fill out
this customer survey.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.083
I already answered
the first question for you.

13:26.166 --> 13:29.000
You rated my top hat
"five top hats."

13:29.083 --> 13:31.625
In Mighty Med,
we rate things with top hats,

13:31.709 --> 13:33.125
because I love top hats!

13:35.291 --> 13:36.750
But I can't leave.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.458
I still have things
I need to do here.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.875
Oh, I get it.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.166
You're feeling
sentimental.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.917
I am, too.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.959
I mean, I remember
when you were this big.

13:48.875 --> 13:49.834
I'll miss you.

13:49.917 --> 13:51.583
But out you go.
You have two minutes.

13:52.917 --> 13:55.917
Actually, I just remembered
I can't go,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.875
because my powers
have started acting all wonky.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.834
Watch.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.125
Explode!

14:03.208 --> 14:04.333
See?

14:04.417 --> 14:06.000
Wonky, wonky, wonky.

14:08.583 --> 14:09.959
Wow.

14:10.041 --> 14:12.041
I remember
when you were this big.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.709
Well, I guess I better stay
for more tests.

14:16.792 --> 14:17.709
Indeed.

14:17.792 --> 14:19.625
I have to prep Neocortex
for surgery,

14:19.709 --> 14:20.959
then we'll run your tests.

14:21.041 --> 14:24.583
But we can't do them
on an empty stomach, so...

14:24.667 --> 14:26.208
you need to finish
these tonsils.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.792
Eat up!

14:37.792 --> 14:40.208
Since the mole is targeting
injured heroes in the hospital,

14:40.291 --> 14:41.667
Neocortex might be
the next victim.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.333
Okay,
I'll deal with Neo.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.166
You set up my phone
to secretly film the mole

14:45.250 --> 14:47.125
trying to turn him evil.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.083
Where should we hide it?

14:49.166 --> 14:50.834
Not in your pants.

14:52.709 --> 14:53.875
Not in my pants.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.875
Where else is there?

14:58.041 --> 15:00.166
Just hide it
on the counter.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.667
Neocortex,
someone in Mighty Med

15:04.750 --> 15:05.709
is turning heroes evil,

15:05.792 --> 15:07.250
and we want to see
if they'll go after you.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.041
Yeah, so we need
to just leave you here,

15:09.125 --> 15:11.500
totally helpless,
tied to the gurney,

15:11.583 --> 15:13.750
under sedation,
completely at risk.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.542
I know
I have a head injury,

15:16.625 --> 15:18.792
but this does not sound
like a good plan.

15:20.792 --> 15:22.709
He's right,
it's too dangerous.

15:22.792 --> 15:26.208
And you are too important
a superhero for us to put you at...

15:28.250 --> 15:30.208
Wow.
That put him to sleep fast.

15:30.291 --> 15:31.875
What's in there,
geometry?

15:34.041 --> 15:36.417
Okay, we need to get
all these people out of here

15:36.500 --> 15:37.959
so the mole
can turn Neo evil.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.792
All right.

15:39.875 --> 15:40.750
Oh, I know what to do.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.333
Attention!
Everyone, clear the area!

15:44.417 --> 15:46.792
A toxic chemical may have
been released accidentally.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.875
(clears throat)
Attention!

15:50.959 --> 15:52.834
Everyone, there is
white cheddar cheese popcorn

15:52.917 --> 15:53.750
in the break room!

16:01.041 --> 16:02.125
I hope this works.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.792
This is my only chance
to clear my name.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.959
Which, by the way, is Oliver.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.709
Because unlike you,
I don't keep secrets.

16:08.792 --> 16:12.500
Why are you giving me
such a hard time about this?

16:12.583 --> 16:14.625
There are plenty of things
that you haven't told me.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.250
Like what?

16:16.333 --> 16:18.250
Like the fact
that you're afraid of elbows.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.875
They're so wrinkly!

16:21.792 --> 16:22.917
And how do you
know that?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.792
I read it
in your feelings journal.

16:24.875 --> 16:26.917
That stuff
is supposed to be secret!

16:27.000 --> 16:28.166
Aha! See?

16:28.250 --> 16:30.709
I thought friends weren't supposed to
keep secrets from each other.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.625
That's why I read
your feelings journal,

16:32.709 --> 16:34.875
to keep you from
being a bad friend.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.959
How did I end up
losing this argument?

16:39.417 --> 16:40.583
Stop!
It's not funny!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.000
Stop it.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.834
(distant grunting)

16:49.750 --> 16:51.792
What happened
to Neocortex?

16:51.875 --> 16:53.750
I give up.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.875
-(growling)
-Someone turned him evil!

16:55.959 --> 16:57.834
Check the video!
We can see who the mole is!

17:00.291 --> 17:01.834
You may be wondering
who did it.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.166
Look no further.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.166
It was yours truly, Oliver.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.375
What the...?

17:06.458 --> 17:08.750
It was you!
I solved the crime!

17:08.834 --> 17:11.000
See? I'm not dumb as dirt.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.083
Dirt couldn't have
figured this out.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.875
Stupid dirt.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.166
I'm gonna go tell
Agent Blaylock!

17:18.250 --> 17:19.417
Alan, don't! I'm innocent!

17:19.500 --> 17:20.709
Yeah,
someone clearly edited

17:20.792 --> 17:22.041
that video to make
him look guilty.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.625
Not so fast!

17:28.166 --> 17:29.250
That's weird.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.792
I was trying to levitate you,

17:30.875 --> 17:33.583
but I turned you
into tortoises.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.417
(Oliver) Ohh, Kaz,
you're so wrinkly!

17:36.500 --> 17:38.625
It's like your whole
body is an elbow!

17:40.041 --> 17:42.667
(Kaz) Alan,
turn us back right now!

17:42.750 --> 17:46.458
Okay, if you just
hold perfectly still,

17:46.542 --> 17:50.166
I'm going to walk
that way and tattle on you.

17:50.250 --> 17:53.166
(Oliver) Hurry, we have to get
to Blaylock before Alan does!

17:53.250 --> 17:54.333
Run!

17:58.750 --> 18:01.417
(Kaz) Hey, slow down!
Wait for me!

18:07.041 --> 18:09.917
-Phase 2 of our plan is almost complete.
-Excellent.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.792
And now that Oliver has taken the fall,
no one will suspect you.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.083
Oh, and be more careful next time
you close the space port...

18:17.166 --> 18:18.125
(distant thud)

18:18.917 --> 18:20.750
Ohh!
What did I just say?

18:24.875 --> 18:26.834
What's going on here?

18:26.917 --> 18:30.041
Agent Blaylock!
What are you doing here?

18:30.125 --> 18:34.583
Well, I woke up
to change couches...

18:34.667 --> 18:36.709
but now I see you were
the mole all along.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.750
Oliver
isn't guilty.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.458
You planted that evidence
in his locker.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.750
Well, you got me.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.959
Aren't you
the clever one?

18:46.041 --> 18:47.875
Actually, my older brother
is the clever one.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.542
He went to MIT.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.750
I'm just a glorified
security guard.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.458
Sorry, Blaylock, but I'm going to have
to destroy all evidence

18:57.542 --> 18:58.875
that points back to me.

18:58.959 --> 19:01.166
And the first item
on the list is you.

19:07.166 --> 19:08.750
(distant laser fire)

19:08.834 --> 19:10.417
(Oliver)
What's that noise?

19:10.500 --> 19:12.333
(Kaz) Something's going down
in the rec room.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.875
Maybe it's the mole!
Let's go!

19:15.083 --> 19:16.875
Dude, pick up the pace.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.750
You run like
you're 100 years old.

19:18.834 --> 19:20.458
For all I know, I am!

19:27.834 --> 19:30.458
Why didn't I just
take a nap in my car?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.875
Ohh. Ahh.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.834
Alan's powers wore off.
Not completely.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.625
I am totally craving
lettuce right now.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.208
You won't get away
with this.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.500
You'll never stop me
and the Annihilator.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.959
Especially if you keep
taking 12-hour naps.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.250
And if you're a statue.

19:56.333 --> 20:00.417
Of course I couldn't stop you
if I were a statue. That's obvious.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.542
Why would you even use
an example like that?

20:05.125 --> 20:07.667
You're about to turn me
into a statue, aren't you?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.125
I can't believe it.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.625
Skylar's the mole?

20:22.709 --> 20:24.792
Wow.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.417
You must be having a lot
of mixed feelings right now.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.875
But don't tell me
what they are.

20:28.959 --> 20:31.667
I want to be surprised when
I read your feelings journal.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.291
What do we do?

20:38.375 --> 20:41.333
We have to tell the League of Heroes that
Skylar is working with the Annihilator.

20:41.417 --> 20:42.417
We can't.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.750
We don't know who we can trust anymore.

20:44.834 --> 20:48.083
Agent Blaylock! I can prove now
that Oliver is the mole.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.542
You do realize he's a statue, right?

20:54.792 --> 20:55.959
I knew that.

20:57.166 --> 21:00.333
And I bet you two did this
to cover your tracks, didn't you?

21:00.417 --> 21:02.500
How could we do that?
We don't have any powers.

21:02.583 --> 21:05.041
And up until two minutes ago
we were tortoises.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.000
And whose fault is that?

21:07.083 --> 21:09.500
Yours!

21:09.583 --> 21:11.625
Then who did it?
Who's the mole?

21:13.125 --> 21:16.166
Um... We don't know.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.750
But Blaylock does.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.709
Maybe I can use my powers
to change him back

21:19.792 --> 21:21.166
and then he can tell us.

21:24.333 --> 21:27.667
(Alan) Yeah,
this could be a problem.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.542
(Kaz) That's right.
You better run!

21:32.917 --> 21:35.333
(theme music playing)
