00:02.040 --> 00:03.315
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.440 --> 00:04.999
<i>I can do some cool things,
you know.</i>

00:05.080 --> 00:07.720
Sometimes I run so fast,
I reverse time a bit.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.871
Dark and Stormy on the house.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.155
Do I look that pathetic?

00:11.280 --> 00:13.096
You look like you belong here
about as much as I do.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.554
- Cisco.
- Kamilla.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.030
We may have found a way
to suppress the meta genome.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.629
Great, then we can use it
to de-power Cicada,

00:19.720 --> 00:21.256
- stop him for good.
- Who the hell are you?

00:21.280 --> 00:22.509
I'm a reporter.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.960
We're gonna beat you.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.110
Damn, you're good,

00:39.200 --> 00:41.157
real good.

00:48.160 --> 00:50.152
Maybe too good.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.199
We did it.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.554
We did it!

01:11.640 --> 01:14.280
Oh, my.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.239
Cisco Ramon,
tonight you've got yourself

01:17.320 --> 01:20.119
a hot date
and a meta-human cure.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.669
We're unstoppable.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.714
Ooh, shrap...

01:36.520 --> 01:38.113
We have to wait how long

01:38.240 --> 01:39.913
before we can use
the meta-human cure?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.753
Not even that long.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.309
- Cisco.
- It's gonna go by like that.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.880
Cisco.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.157
- 29 days.
- A month?

01:50.240 --> 01:55.599
I know, right?
Just one, teeny, tiny month

01:55.680 --> 01:57.637
until we stop Cicada's purge.
You know,

01:57.760 --> 01:59.216
historically speaking,
this is way faster

01:59.240 --> 02:00.799
than we've ever
stopped a big bad so...

02:00.880 --> 02:03.236
We can't wait that long.
If he finds another meta

02:03.320 --> 02:06.199
or comes after us... we have
to speed this up somehow.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.776
We have to wait for the
compound to fully synthesize

02:07.800 --> 02:09.560
or it won't be able
to effectively neutralize

02:09.600 --> 02:11.637
the dark matter in
a meta-human's pituitary gland.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.394
Without any way to expedite
the exotic evolution...

02:14.480 --> 02:15.576
Barry,
we're gonna have to wait.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.670
I think we have to wait.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.752
Unless...

02:18.840 --> 02:22.197
you took it into
the Speed Force.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.717
- Hmm?
- What, you want him to go into

02:24.800 --> 02:26.757
the Speed Force for a month
and then, what,

02:26.840 --> 02:28.320
come out the same
day that he left?

02:28.400 --> 02:32.633
Oh, no, no, I'm not saying
you manipulate time.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.916
I'm saying you manipulate
dark matter.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.196
So very simple.
It's simple chemistry, right?

02:37.280 --> 02:40.034
When you are synthesizing
a compound, you use a...

02:40.120 --> 02:42.271
commodity, uh, substrate, uh...

02:42.360 --> 02:44.670
- A catalyst?
- Catalyst, right.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.594
And the most efficient catalyst
you can use when synthesizing

02:47.680 --> 02:49.273
a compound that negates
dark matter

02:49.360 --> 02:51.352
is superluminal particles.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.517
- Tachyons?
<i>- Très bien.</i>

02:53.600 --> 02:56.069
Tachyons, and the place where
tachyons are the most dense?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.914
- The Speed Force.
<i>- Et voilà.</i>

02:59.520 --> 03:00.590
That might actually work.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.876
Yeah, it will.
It'll be like nuking it

03:02.960 --> 03:05.316
in a pan-dimensional microwave.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.959
- Nice work.
- I know.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.719
So how much time
would this save?

03:08.800 --> 03:13.238
From 29 days
down to 60 minutes.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.674
Yeah, it's gonna be faster.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.594
And also since Cicada
has been quiet

03:17.680 --> 03:19.160
since your last encounter,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.311
maybe there's no time
like the present.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.077
- Do it.
- All right.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.389
I'll see you in an hour.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.438
Nora, you need to stay here.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.590
You don't want my help?

03:38.680 --> 03:40.433
I just...
I got this one this time.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.830
Are you sure that now
is a good time to go?

03:42.920 --> 03:46.277
I mean, I just mean,
the city will be Flash-less,

03:46.360 --> 03:50.434
and an hour is a long time
to be without the Flash.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.797
The city is not gonna be
Flash-less. It'll have XS.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.196
Yeah, but what about the time
you had to spend 24 hours

03:56.280 --> 03:58.840
in the Pipeline cell and
Weather Witch and Silver Ghost

03:58.920 --> 04:01.000
- stole that A.R.G.U.S. car...
- And you stopped them

04:01.040 --> 04:02.793
without me.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.032
But with what happened to Mom
because of Cicada...

04:06.120 --> 04:10.512
Nore, Iris is fine, and this
is the key to stopping Cicada.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.511
I gotta go.
If anything happens,

04:15.600 --> 04:16.815
just do what
I've trained you to do:

04:16.839 --> 04:18.559
Slow down and think clearly.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.392
- Yeah.
- I trust you.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.153
You just gotta
trust yourself.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.560
You'll be fine.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.075
60 minutes.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.274
Nora, Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet, has he?

04:45.360 --> 04:46.589
Uh, I don't think so.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.713
Great, we get another
chance at this.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.880
Well, it is... that's why
you don't do it.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.599
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.795
Oh, God.
Not the <i>Book of Ralph</i> again!

05:07.880 --> 05:09.792
Yeah, buddy.
You successfully completed

05:09.880 --> 05:12.190
my 27 steps to getting over
the love of your life.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.715
Gypsy is in the past.
You have a new siren,

05:14.800 --> 05:17.190
so now it's time for...

05:18.280 --> 05:19.316
<i>The Art of Love.</i>

05:19.400 --> 05:20.550
Um, Caitlin?

05:22.360 --> 05:24.680
I've gotta finish working on
the device to inject the cure.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.589
Also I have to inject
the device for the cure.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.040
I... I... I... Iris?

05:30.120 --> 05:32.271
Oh, no, this is all you, man.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.560
I got an article
I gotta write.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.114
Let me know when Barry
gets back.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.192
<i>Help me.</i>

05:42.320 --> 05:44.789
"Chapter one:
Initial Planning."

05:44.880 --> 05:48.237
Initial planning?
It's a first date, Sun Tzu,

05:48.320 --> 05:50.040
- not an incursion.
- Trust me, Grasshopper,

05:50.160 --> 05:53.358
love is war, but, fine,
if you wanna skip

05:53.440 --> 05:55.909
to chapter six,
"Know Your Terrain."

05:56.040 --> 05:59.397
- We're meeting at Jitters.
- Ah, familiar territory.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.880
You are learning.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.316
Uh, you know,
he really should be going.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.176
- I really should.
- Hang on, hang on one second.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.238
This one's really important.
Chapter thirteen,

06:08.320 --> 06:10.835
"Intelligence
and Reconnaissance."

06:14.280 --> 06:16.636
Wh...
you cyber-stalked Kamilla?

06:16.720 --> 06:18.518
No, no, no, no,
of course not.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.319
That's her public profile.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.800
But it did happen to have
some info

06:21.840 --> 06:23.336
on the types of guys
that she might be into.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.511
The types of guys
that she's into?

06:25.600 --> 06:30.038
Yes, and, unfortunately,
you are nothing like them,

06:30.120 --> 06:32.555
but, hey, if you don't wanna
get a second date, be my guest.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.280
Just don't come crying to me
when everything inevitably

06:35.360 --> 06:37.795
goes horribly, horribly wrong
and you die alone.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.234
No big deal.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.476
See, now he's in my head.
Okay, no thank you.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.074
I didn't take these.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.800
- You saw nothing.
- Nothing.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.280
One Cicada on the bar
for Ian?

07:58.360 --> 08:01.194
It's I-an.
Sorry, I-an.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.954
<i>♪♪ Now, I don't butt
into nobody's business ♪♪</i>

08:08.040 --> 08:10.555
Hey, Kamilla.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.393
Cisco.
Wow.

08:12.480 --> 08:15.120
Sorry I'm late.
I got held up at a meeting.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.240
That's okay.
I just got here.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.976
If I'd had known,
I would have dressed up more.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.912
Oh, this old thing?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.038
No, please,
this is work clothes.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.874
You have to wear a suit
to your lab?

08:28.960 --> 08:30.076
My lab?

08:30.160 --> 08:31.560
When we met at the bar,

08:31.640 --> 08:33.279
you were talking about
DNA and genomes,

08:33.360 --> 08:35.352
so I assumed you were
some kind of scientist.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.638
Right, I said that,
scientist.

08:38.720 --> 08:42.077
Yes. No. Well,
I'm what you would call

08:42.159 --> 08:46.313
a science businessman.

08:46.400 --> 08:51.111
So, what, you make money
off of other people's discoveries?

08:51.200 --> 08:56.195
Well, somebody has to.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.669
It's just a little joke,
something I always say.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.394
So, uh, what is the name
of the company you work for?

09:04.840 --> 09:08.629
It's called Ramon Industries.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.637
It's named after yourself?

09:12.520 --> 09:15.035
That's humble.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.677
Maybe I should grab us
a couple coffees.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.479
Sure.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.270
- Decaf Flash.
- Decaf Flash, right, okay.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.669
You're not the only one
who does their research.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.674
I know who you are,
Iris West-Allen.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.398
I know you work with the Flash
and the other heroes.

09:53.480 --> 09:56.075
You said you were
gonna beat me,

09:56.160 --> 10:01.952
but tonight,
I'm gonna beat you,

10:02.040 --> 10:03.235
all of you.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.991
One Zoom
and one decaf Flash.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.437
That's the decaf.
Men in this city...

10:19.520 --> 10:24.117
Tell me about it.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.511
Uh, I'm sorry, it's work.
I have to go.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.877
Uh, could we just have,
like, a do-over, please?

10:50.280 --> 10:51.634
It's Mom.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.274
Get away from her.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.113
She's not who you want.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.551
No, she's not,
but you are.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.314
Then come and get us.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.716
Ah!

11:36.840 --> 11:38.433
Caitlin!

11:46.640 --> 11:48.154
Told ya.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.836
Nora, Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet, has he?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.593
Uh, I don't think so.

12:30.680 --> 12:34.117
Great, we get another chance
at this.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.036
We do.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.193
- What's wrong?
- Uh, nothing.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.476
I just have to fix this.
Okay.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.956
Oh, God, not the...

13:01.040 --> 13:02.156
"Book of Ralph."

13:02.240 --> 13:03.656
- Again!
- Yeah, buddy,

13:03.680 --> 13:05.592
You have successfully
completed my 27 steps

13:05.720 --> 13:07.200
to getting over
the love of your life.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.670
Gypsy is in the past,
you have a new siren,

13:09.760 --> 13:11.956
so now it's time
for <i>The Art of Love.</i>

13:12.040 --> 13:13.679
Um, Caitlin?

13:13.760 --> 13:15.991
I gotta go finish
the device to inject the cure.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.391
Also have to inject
the device for the cure.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.234
- I... I... I... Iris?
- Oh, no, this is all you, man.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.919
I got an article I gotta write.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.673
Let me know when Barry
gets back.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.240
So not shway.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.915
"Chapter one:
Initial Planning."

13:36.720 --> 13:39.360
- Uh, you can't leave.
- What?

13:39.440 --> 13:41.511
I mean, you just shouldn't go
to your office,

13:41.600 --> 13:43.592
- not right now.
- Why?

13:43.680 --> 13:47.674
Because Dad is gonna be back,
like, any minute

13:47.760 --> 13:48.816
and by the time
that you get there,

13:48.840 --> 13:50.536
you're just gonna
have to turn around anyway.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.336
Yeah, I know, but I need
to get this article out tonight.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.560
Yeah, but, I mean, you have
your laptop with you, right?

13:54.640 --> 13:56.154
So why don't you just
write it here

13:56.240 --> 13:59.074
in the lounge where it's safe?

13:59.160 --> 14:00.594
Safe?

14:00.680 --> 14:03.878
I mean cozy.
It's cozy.

14:03.960 --> 14:07.920
Um, yeah, I mean, yeah.
I guess I could.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.071
Great, I'll make you coffee.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.112
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.351
You end up dying alone.

14:19.080 --> 14:24.633
Okay, see, now he's in my head.
No thank you, Ralph.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.952
Dang it.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.191
Last bottle.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.795
One Cicada at the bar
for Ian.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.190
- It's I-an.
- Sorry, I-an.

15:41.680 --> 15:45.151
- Kamilla, hey.
- Cisco, wow.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.197
Sorry I'm late.
I just came from the gym.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.999
You gotta get your steps in,
you know?

15:49.080 --> 15:52.391
That's okay,
I just got here.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.233
You work out a lot?

15:54.320 --> 15:57.597
You kidding me?
I'm, like, a gym rat, you know.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.831
I live there.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.400
So what kind of workouts
do you do?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.993
What kind of workouts
don't I do? I mean, like,

16:06.080 --> 16:09.596
Pilates for the core,
plyometrics for the quads,

16:09.680 --> 16:11.416
circuit training, I mean,
pretty much anything

16:11.440 --> 16:13.056
I can get my hands on,
even my hands, you know.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.480
I've been known to do some

16:14.560 --> 16:15.976
you know, finger pushups
every once in a while.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.835
- What?
- When we met at the bar,

16:20.920 --> 16:23.594
you were talking about
DNA and genomes, so...

16:23.680 --> 16:27.037
So you thought maybe
I wasn't your type?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.880
I thought I had finally met
a guy who was more concerned

16:30.960 --> 16:33.236
with flexing his brain
than his muscles.

16:38.080 --> 16:43.155
Okay, um, maybe I should
grab us a couple coffees.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.631
Sure, decaf Flash.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.030
Decaf Flash,
I was gonna ask you.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.798
I know who you are,
Elongated Man.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.311
I know you work with the Flash
and the other heroes.

17:08.079 --> 17:13.234
Iris West-Allen told me
you were gonna beat me.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.960
But tonight,

17:16.040 --> 17:19.431
I'm gonna beat you,

17:19.520 --> 17:23.958
all of you.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.759
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.637
Thanks.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.432
- The men in this city.
- Tell me about it.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.398
That's the decaf.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.233
The men in this city...

17:44.320 --> 17:47.199
Tell me about it.

17:49.880 --> 17:53.317
Uh, I'm sorry,
it's a gym emergency.

17:53.400 --> 17:58.873
I have to go. Um, can we just
have a do-over, please?

18:14.920 --> 18:16.639
- Ralph.
- Get Caitlin.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.235
Okay.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.716
Move!

18:45.480 --> 18:47.437
Ralph?

18:58.280 --> 18:59.839
Told ya.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.673
Nora, Cisco hasn't left
for his date yet, has he?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.594
Uh, no, I'm pretty sure
he hasn't.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.757
Great, I'm gonna get
another chance at this.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.471
Yeah, we do.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.038
What's wrong?

19:45.840 --> 19:47.240
Nora?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.720
Nothing.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.520
Come on,
you can figure this out.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.956
Not the "Book of Ralph"
again!

19:54.040 --> 19:56.953
Yeah, buddy, you successfully
completed my 27 steps

19:57.040 --> 19:58.520
to getting over
the love of your life.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.876
Gypsy is in the past.
You have a new siren,

20:00.960 --> 20:03.759
so now it's time
for <i>The Art of Love.</i>

20:03.840 --> 20:04.910
Um, Caitlin?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.071
I gotta go work on the device
to inject the cure.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.959
Also I have to devise
the cure.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.190
I... I... I... Iris?

20:11.280 --> 20:13.192
Ooh, nah,
that's all you, man.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.475
I gotta go write an article.

20:14.560 --> 20:15.736
Let me know
when Barry gets back.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.240
Uh, no, you know what?
Don't go.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.194
Uh, why don't you write
the article here?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.437
Uh, I can make you coffee.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.830
I mean, I know that there's coffee
over there, but I...

20:24.920 --> 20:26.336
I just think it's really
important for the team leader

20:26.360 --> 20:28.079
to stay here
until Dad gets back

20:28.160 --> 20:30.231
just in case something
happens, okay?

20:34.240 --> 20:36.516
Okay, lounge it is.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.672
All right, "Chapter one:
Initial Planning."

20:39.800 --> 20:42.235
It's a first date, Sun Tzu,
not an incursion.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.596
Trust me, Grasshopper,
love is war.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.280
Yeah, and I couldn't agree more,
so read these.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.056
They'll help you,
and you'll know what to do.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.256
Wait, wait, how...
And if anything goes wrong,

20:50.280 --> 20:51.919
just give us a call.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.390
You and I are gonna stay here
and have our own coffees

20:54.520 --> 20:56.477
in the lounge.
There's brownies.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.630
- Brownies?
- Yes.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.713
Ralph,
did you cyber-stalk her?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.875
You were talking about
DNA and genomes.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.496
I thought I'd finally met
a guy who was more concerned

21:11.520 --> 21:13.398
with flexing his brain
than his muscles.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.159
<i>Ça va?</i>

21:20.240 --> 21:23.472
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry, I just...

21:23.560 --> 21:26.553
I'm having the most
wicked déjà vu right now.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.830
Is that right?

22:04.280 --> 22:08.069
Why don't you want your
mother to come here, hmm?

22:21.160 --> 22:23.675
Because you time-travel.

22:31.920 --> 22:34.594
- It's I-an.
- Sorry, I-an.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.509
Kamilla the thrilla.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.751
Cisco?

22:43.880 --> 22:46.111
- Wow.
- Sorry I'm late.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.793
I just came from a photoshoot.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.759
The things you do
for the 'gram, am I right?

22:50.840 --> 22:53.116
Hey, maybe next time you should
be my photographer.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.395
What do you think?

22:54.480 --> 22:55.960
So you're a...

22:56.040 --> 22:58.760
I'm an aspiring
social media influencer.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.479
This is my card.
You can keep that.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.640
When we met at the bar,

23:07.720 --> 23:09.712
you were talking about
DNA and genomes,

23:09.800 --> 23:12.554
so I assumed you were
some kind of scientist.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.360
Really?
When we met at the bar,

23:16.440 --> 23:19.160
you were talking about
DNA and genomes, so I...

23:19.240 --> 23:22.995
You assumed
I was some kind of scientist?

23:23.080 --> 23:26.232
Yeah, exactly.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.720
Is everything okay?

23:27.840 --> 23:33.154
Yeah, I'm just having
some déjà vu again.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.277
Maybe I should grab us
a couple of coffees?

23:37.360 --> 23:40.080
Oh, yes.
Yes, that'd be great.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.800
Will you get me a Zoom,
please?

23:42.880 --> 23:44.678
Okay.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.672
What?

23:48.040 --> 23:51.920
Okay, here we go.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.275
Thanks.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.590
One Zoom and one decaf Flash.
Thank you.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.513
Something's wrong,

24:07.600 --> 24:10.399
- and I think I have to go.
- Right now?

24:10.480 --> 24:13.598
No, right now.

24:14.800 --> 24:19.477
Yep, gotta go.
Um, I'd ask if we could have

24:19.600 --> 24:24.038
a do-over, but, um, something
tells me I already have.

24:27.840 --> 24:31.390
- The men in this city.
- Tell me about it.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.277
- Come on!
- It's Sherloque.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.033
What? I thought he was here
with Caitlin.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.476
- We gotta get Frost.
- No, no, I got this.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.200
You guys just stay here.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.230
<i>- Garçon,</i> look out!
- Ah!

25:15.840 --> 25:17.991
Told ya.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.158
Cisco!

25:22.240 --> 25:25.233
Why can't I fix this?

25:34.680 --> 25:39.880
Ugh! Why can't
I go back any further?

25:39.960 --> 25:42.395
- Nora?
- Cisco hasn't left yet.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.709
Great.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.393
So we get another
chance at this.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.920
We do.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.390
I'm fine,
Sherloque.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.312
I have to fix this.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.630
Okay,
you guys have to stay here.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.319
- Why?
- Because Dad put his trust

26:18.400 --> 26:20.039
in me that I would protect
all of you

26:20.120 --> 26:21.856
and I'm the only speedster here
for the first time

26:21.880 --> 26:23.720
and if something were to go
wrong, I don't know

26:23.800 --> 26:25.496
if I could fix it. In fact,
I'm pretty sure that I couldn't

26:25.520 --> 26:29.070
fix it, so just,
for one hour, stay here.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.396
I have to go finish...

26:34.480 --> 26:37.154
- No, no!
- I got a date with...

26:40.240 --> 26:42.835
Were you
cyber-stalking Kamilla?

26:42.920 --> 26:44.296
No, no, no,
of course not.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.039
This is her public profile.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.376
You were talking
about DNA and genomes,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.153
so I thought I'd finally
met a guy

26:49.240 --> 26:52.119
who's more concerned with
his brain than his muscles.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.157
- Kamilla.
- Oh, I got some details on

26:56.240 --> 26:57.656
- the kinds of guys she's into.
- Mm-mm.

26:57.680 --> 26:59.876
Wait,
were you cyber-stalking her?

26:59.960 --> 27:02.714
No, I'm not stalking her.
It's her public profile.

27:02.800 --> 27:06.919
Guys! I'm sorry, but you're
just gonna have to stay here.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.038
- I-an.
- Sorry, I-an.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.391
You have got to be
kidding me.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.439
You got the first one.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.496
- I got the next one.
- I think we all got one.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.056
- Please, please, please...
- What did you get?

28:11.080 --> 28:14.232
- It's Cecile.
- Guys, um, just stay here.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.713
Told ya.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.594
Nora?

28:54.680 --> 28:56.114
I was supposed
to protect you,

28:56.200 --> 28:58.271
but I can't.
I don't know how to.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.756
But my dad does.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.553
I can't get into
the Speed Force either?

29:29.040 --> 29:30.713
You're reversing time,
aren't you?

29:35.720 --> 29:37.598
And I can't fix it.

29:43.240 --> 29:46.199
So all of us die?

29:46.280 --> 29:47.999
Sometimes,

29:48.080 --> 29:50.754
or just one of you.

29:50.840 --> 29:55.960
Sometimes Cecile, but every time,
there's at least one.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.838
I thought I was having
déjà vu.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.195
Hmm?

29:59.280 --> 30:02.956
I keep seeing my date
with Kamilla again and again,

30:03.040 --> 30:08.240
me failing miserably every time
by using these.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.630
I'm not having déjà vu.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.353
I'm vibing the past hour
over and over.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.635
Yeah.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.791
How many times
has this happened?

30:17.880 --> 30:20.714
- 52.
- 52?

30:20.800 --> 30:22.080
This is one
of those fixed points

30:22.160 --> 30:24.152
the Legends theorized,
isn't it?

30:24.240 --> 30:26.232
There's no way to
keep one of us from dying.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.074
- We have to get Barry.
- No, I tried that,

30:29.160 --> 30:30.296
but there's something
wrong with me.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.913
I can't get into
the Speed Force.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Well, then we'll just wait
here until he gets back.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.272
No, if we do that,
Cicada will kill Cecile.

30:37.360 --> 30:39.136
So just reverse time
and go back to before he left.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.358
No, I've tried that too,
but I can't control it.

30:42.440 --> 30:46.832
It doesn't matter what I try
to do. Nothing works!

30:55.800 --> 31:00.670
Believe it or not,
this ain't the first time

31:00.760 --> 31:03.480
I've died in a past timeline.

31:03.560 --> 31:09.033
I once got a vibrating hand
through the chest

31:09.120 --> 31:12.636
courtesy of Eobard Thawne.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.598
Well, more than once.

31:14.680 --> 31:18.196
I actually kept vibing
that moment until I realized

31:18.280 --> 31:20.795
that it actually happened.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.776
I guess I should have known
the same thing

31:23.800 --> 31:25.075
was happening now, huh?

31:29.000 --> 31:34.553
I keep trying my absolute hardest
to change the outcome,

31:34.640 --> 31:38.350
but I end up failing
every time.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.432
What if we can't fix this,
Cisco?

31:43.080 --> 31:46.994
Nora, sometimes
we fail because...

31:47.080 --> 31:50.471
all we worry about
is not failing.

31:52.760 --> 31:56.231
I'm so worried about
my first date since Cynthia

31:56.320 --> 31:59.518
that I don't feel free
to be myself around Kamilla,

31:59.600 --> 32:02.877
and then I'll just end up
screwing it up even more.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.556
This... this intelligence
and reconnaissance mess,

32:06.640 --> 32:10.554
I don't need this.
All I need is to be myself.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.791
Duh! And I sure as hell

32:12.880 --> 32:16.032
don't need to dress up
like Ozone

32:16.160 --> 32:18.197
just to impress Kamilla.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.556
Sorry, that is
an outdated reference.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.472
No, from the movie
<i>Breakin'.</i>

32:22.560 --> 32:25.234
Yeah, I've seen
<i>Electric Boogaloo</i> too.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.616
I've seen them both,
like, a hundred times.

32:26.640 --> 32:27.869
I know every move.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.191
Wow, fangirl.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.680
Wait.

32:36.760 --> 32:38.160
Wait, that's it.

32:38.240 --> 32:42.154
Every time I fail,
I take notes in my journal

32:42.240 --> 32:43.936
so I can do something
different the next time.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.794
We know every move.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.839
So all you need to do
is just tell us

32:49.920 --> 32:51.957
everything you've done
and how it went wrong.

32:52.040 --> 32:56.319
So we can figure out
how to make it right.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.960
52 kidnappings,
52 combinations

32:59.080 --> 33:00.560
leading to 52 deaths.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.519
- None of them were Cicada's?
- Exactly.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.273
Yes, exactly.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.080
Wait, does that mean you want
to use Cicada's dagger

33:08.160 --> 33:10.629
against him by having Nora
reverse time?

33:10.720 --> 33:12.234
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.039
Yeah, but how are we
gonna do that?

33:14.120 --> 33:16.096
I mean, Nora can't control it
when she reverses time.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.793
She could control
her abilities

33:17.880 --> 33:21.317
if we help her slow down.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.039
Slowing it down.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.840
If she can do that,
we bring the fight to him.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.799
And we all live
through the night.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.200
I like the sound of that.

33:30.280 --> 33:33.876
Well, we have
everything we need.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.514
Looking for me?

34:14.120 --> 34:17.272
I know you did your research.

34:17.360 --> 34:21.797
You know who I am, you know
that I work with the Flash

34:21.880 --> 34:23.917
and the other heroes.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.277
I told you
we were gonna beat you,

34:28.360 --> 34:29.679
and tonight we will...

34:32.400 --> 34:36.599
All of us.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.000
<i>Allez,</i> now!

35:48.640 --> 35:50.836
Ah!

36:07.160 --> 36:09.231
Told you.

36:21.240 --> 36:25.393
No dark matter anywhere.
Dwyer's gone, again.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.278
Maybe after the ass kicking
he just got,

36:27.360 --> 36:29.317
he'll think twice
before coming after us again.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.234
And if he doesn't think
twice, now you can make him.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.797
Thanks for helping me
slow it down.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.355
Now that I've experienced
a sense of control,

36:38.440 --> 36:40.318
maybe next time,
I can do it on my own.

36:40.400 --> 36:44.679
Well, thank you for saving us,
all of us.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.275
I didn't save everything.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.317
Maybe you can now?

36:49.400 --> 36:51.676
No, no, that date is over.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.797
There's no way Kamilla's
still at Jitters.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.634
Well, if she is still there,
there might be some stuff

36:56.720 --> 36:59.360
in here that can help you
smooth things over.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.555
But you can handle it.
You're Cisco Ramon.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.474
Come on,
you gotta get a move on.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.472
Okay.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.233
- Giddyap, Romeo.
- I'm moving.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.039
Okay.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.674
Sherloque was right.
One hour, it's cooked.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.119
Something happen
while I was gone?

37:31.720 --> 37:34.030
Kid Flash on the bar
for Steven?

37:34.120 --> 37:36.555
- It's Stephan.
- Sorry, Stephan.

37:40.240 --> 37:44.314
- Kamilla, hey.
- Cisco, wow.

37:45.800 --> 37:51.432
I am so sorry I'm late.
I had an emergency at work.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.039
That's okay,
I just got here.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.950
So you're a scientist,
right?

38:00.040 --> 38:01.440
When we were at the bar,

38:01.520 --> 38:05.230
you were talking about
DNA and genomes, so...

38:05.320 --> 38:07.516
Well...

38:07.600 --> 38:11.833
I'm more of a tech nerd,
actually, but the project

38:11.920 --> 38:15.391
that we're working on now,
it gets very scientific.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.656
You sound like
you're really excited about it.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.149
Oh, my God, I am.
I'm so excited about it.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.799
You have no idea. Um...

38:21.880 --> 38:26.671
I think we might have made
a breakthrough recently,

38:26.760 --> 38:29.150
a breakthrough
that could change a lot of lives.

38:33.880 --> 38:36.315
One Zoom
and one decaf Flash.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.120
I hope you don't mind,
I called it in ahead of time.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.873
It's the least I could do.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.998
- That's the decaf.
- How did you know what I like?

38:45.320 --> 38:47.198
I had a feeling.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.158
Not like most of the men
in this city.

38:49.240 --> 38:51.311
Tell me about it.

38:52.520 --> 38:58.073
Listen, I know I screwed up royally
showing up late

38:58.160 --> 39:02.552
like this, but it would make me
very happy if...

39:04.840 --> 39:09.471
Can we just
have a do-over, please?

39:10.640 --> 39:11.835
That sounds nice.

39:15.760 --> 39:18.229
52 times?

39:19.800 --> 39:23.316
53, if you include now.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.869
That's a lot.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.637
What was I supposed to do,
let one of them die?

39:32.480 --> 39:36.633
The thing is, Nora, there are
consequences to time travel.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.632
- Oh, I know.
- No, you don't,

39:39.480 --> 39:40.880
not like I do.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.518
Let me show you something.

39:52.280 --> 39:56.240
Imagine this coffee cup
is the space/time continuum.

39:56.320 --> 40:00.997
Whenever you go back in time,
it breaks.

40:02.840 --> 40:08.154
Now, you can try and reset
the timeline,

40:08.240 --> 40:13.076
try and fix it, but no matter
how hard you try,

40:13.160 --> 40:15.800
it's never
gonna be exactly how it was.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.073
It seems like things worked
out this time,

40:21.160 --> 40:22.719
but that's not
always gonna be true,

40:22.800 --> 40:26.635
and it's impossible to know how
these changes are gonna unfold,

40:26.720 --> 40:30.600
the ripples you'll cause,
whose life you're gonna affect.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.990
No one can do that.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.594
No one?

40:34.680 --> 40:35.680
No one.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.512
We're not gods, Nora.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.956
We've just been given
extraordinary abilities.

41:26.120 --> 41:31.240
Thawne, I need to know
we're not making this worse.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.680
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.594
I am the only speedster
who knows what he's doing!

41:40.680 --> 41:43.036
Stick with the plan.

41:44.200 --> 41:48.319
Follow my instructions
and we'll defeat Cicada,

41:48.440 --> 41:50.750
we'll destroy his dagger,

41:50.840 --> 41:55.073
and then we will
save your father.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.674
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
