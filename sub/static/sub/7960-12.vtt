WEBVTT

00:01.274 --> 00:03.091
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:03.092 --> 00:04.117
You guys did very well.

00:04.118 --> 00:06.747
I think you're perfect
candidates for adoption.

00:06.748 --> 00:07.747
Oh, that's great.

00:07.748 --> 00:10.117
Thank you so much.

00:10.118 --> 00:13.077
So, the next thing for us to do
is schedule a home visit.

00:13.078 --> 00:14.118
Whose home?

00:16.288 --> 00:18.457
Yeah, we are totally committed

00:18.458 --> 00:20.697
to creating a healthy
and safe environment

00:20.698 --> 00:21.957
- for this child.
- Yeah.

00:21.958 --> 00:24.457
I promise you, we will
take good care of it.

00:29.408 --> 00:31.537
I appreciate you being
so thorough and open.

00:31.538 --> 00:33.907
Most couples hoping to adopt
aren't as forthcoming.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.117
So, about your living situation.

00:36.118 --> 00:38.158
- We live alone.
- Just the two of us.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.907
Why do we have to take
new holiday photos

00:44.908 --> 00:46.577
for the adoption agency?

00:46.578 --> 00:50.037
I mean, I look fantastic
in these old ones.

00:50.038 --> 00:51.657
Because we have to show
expectant mothers that,

00:51.658 --> 00:53.747
if they pick us,
that their child will be raised

00:53.748 --> 00:55.457
in a safe
and wholesome environment.

00:55.458 --> 00:57.457
What's not wholesome here?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.115
Wine glass.

00:59.868 --> 01:00.908
Shot glass.

01:02.118 --> 01:03.118
Beer bong.

01:04.578 --> 01:06.395
Bong bong.

01:06.655 --> 01:09.157
Okay, all right,
let's make some memories, people.

01:09.158 --> 01:11.497
Victoria, hold the branch up.
Mike, grab an ornament.

01:11.498 --> 01:12.617
Mom.

01:12.618 --> 01:14.578
Get a shot of us decorating
the Christmas tree.

01:19.823 --> 01:20.862
Got it!

01:20.863 --> 01:22.653
Okay, next.
Lose the sweater!

01:23.943 --> 01:25.782
Okay, we got to celebrate
two birthdays,

01:25.783 --> 01:26.992
we got to carve some pumpkins,

01:26.993 --> 01:29.072
we got to pose for
that Fourth of July picture

01:29.073 --> 01:32.032
in front of the neighbor's pool
before they get home.

01:32.033 --> 01:35.903
Are we doing Halloween now or do
I have time to run to Costco?

02:07.491 --> 02:09.910
All right, what number
did you give the agency?

02:09.911 --> 02:11.570
I gave them everyone's number.

02:11.571 --> 02:14.240
Uh, my phone, your phone,
the house phone, the work phone.

02:14.241 --> 02:17.466
Everything except Victoria's
dealer and Vince's bookie.

02:18.451 --> 02:20.450
Maybe they hated
our photo album, huh?

02:20.451 --> 02:23.030
Oh, God... I never should have
included that old-timey picture

02:23.031 --> 02:24.910
we did at Six Flags.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.570
Now I bet they think
we're really wanted.

02:27.571 --> 02:29.990
Sweetie, it's only been a week.

02:29.991 --> 02:31.650
The last thing they said was,
"Be patient,

02:31.651 --> 02:32.950
these things take time."

02:32.951 --> 02:34.360
What the hell kind
of advice is that

02:34.361 --> 02:36.820
to give to an expectant parent?

02:36.821 --> 02:39.530
Mol, a real baby
takes nine months.

02:39.531 --> 02:41.570
The least we could do
is give them two weeks.

02:41.571 --> 02:43.150
Two weeks?

02:43.151 --> 02:44.740
I thought you wanted a baby.

02:44.741 --> 02:46.200
Okay, if you're not all in,
tell me now

02:46.201 --> 02:48.490
because I will
raise it on my own.

02:48.491 --> 02:50.110
Take it easy, okay?

02:50.111 --> 02:52.990
We're both on
the same side here.

02:52.991 --> 02:54.820
Then why aren't you
all crazy like me?

02:54.821 --> 02:56.450
Because I leave the house.

02:56.451 --> 02:57.780
You're in this cage all day

02:57.781 --> 02:59.910
pacing around like
that cross-eyed zebra at the zoo

02:59.911 --> 03:01.700
we sneak marshmallows to.

03:01.701 --> 03:05.031
Poor little Stewart,
he don't see right.

03:06.031 --> 03:07.410
What do you say

03:07.411 --> 03:10.320
we get the hell out of
here and take a walk.

03:10.321 --> 03:12.780
You're right.
I'm sorry I'm acting like this.

03:12.781 --> 03:15.030
I'm not. Just shows
how much you want this

03:15.031 --> 03:16.861
and what a good mom
you're gonna be.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.360
Fresh air.

03:23.361 --> 03:25.860
Blue sky.
What a day.

03:25.861 --> 03:28.070
All right.
I'm good.

03:28.071 --> 03:30.030
No, you don't.
No, no, no.

03:30.031 --> 03:32.530
Come on, we should at least
make it down to the sidewalk.

03:36.031 --> 03:37.200
Did you bring the house key?

03:37.201 --> 03:39.410
Me? No, you're the one
who dragged me out here.

03:39.411 --> 03:41.110
I was happy inside.

03:41.111 --> 03:42.530
What are we supposed to do now?

03:42.531 --> 03:44.530
I don't know. All I know is
our baby is calling

03:44.531 --> 03:46.201
on the other side of that door.

03:49.611 --> 03:50.740
Don't hang up!

03:50.741 --> 03:52.700
Don't hang up!
Don't hang up!

03:56.031 --> 03:59.530
Hello? Hello?

03:59.531 --> 04:03.201
No, Vince, we do not
need anything from Costco.

04:11.701 --> 04:12.860
Ten years on the job.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.360
I never had to kick in
a door until it was my own.

04:15.361 --> 04:16.781
Does that ankle
look swollen to you?

04:18.151 --> 04:19.820
They both do.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.610
But I'm guessing
it's water retention.

04:21.611 --> 04:23.570
Yeah, I think it's
all that salt you eat.

04:23.571 --> 04:25.280
Not in the mood, Carl.

04:25.281 --> 04:27.320
Hey, listen, we both
have to watch our sodium.

04:27.321 --> 04:28.410
Look how fat my fingers are.

04:28.411 --> 04:29.611
Can't even wear my thumb ring.

04:29.816 --> 04:32.240
Get out.

04:32.241 --> 04:34.910
It's just this whole baby thing
has got us on edge, you know?

04:34.911 --> 04:36.610
I'm trying to be
strong for Molly,

04:36.611 --> 04:39.450
but I'm going
just as nuts as she is.

04:39.451 --> 04:41.110
Well, you know
what I always say.

04:41.111 --> 04:42.360
It'll happen...

04:42.361 --> 04:43.741
when it happens.

04:45.151 --> 04:46.360
Really?

04:46.361 --> 04:47.740
Is that when it happens, Carl?

04:47.741 --> 04:48.741
When it <i>happens?</i>

04:50.741 --> 04:52.611
Well, not with that attitude.

04:53.911 --> 04:55.360
Look, you don't know
what we're going through.

04:55.361 --> 04:58.030
It's like slow torture waiting
for that phone to ring.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.200
All right.

04:59.201 --> 05:00.650
I can see that this
is tearing you apart,

05:00.651 --> 05:02.320
and I know you don't
want to hear this, but...

05:02.321 --> 05:04.700
I think you may need to
talk to a professional.

05:04.701 --> 05:06.610
Like a therapist?

05:06.611 --> 05:07.700
No, better.

05:07.701 --> 05:08.700
My psychic.

05:08.701 --> 05:10.700
Get out of here.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.610
I'm telling you, man,
Madame Vianne is the real deal.

05:12.611 --> 05:14.610
She knows all, she sees all.

05:14.611 --> 05:16.490
And she's a life coach.

05:16.491 --> 05:19.411
And if you need anything
notarized, bring that, too.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:36.781 --> 05:38.200
What's all that racket?

05:38.201 --> 05:39.910
Oh, that?
Don't worry.

05:39.911 --> 05:42.860
After a half hour,
you won't even notice it.

05:42.861 --> 05:44.110
How was brunch?

05:44.111 --> 05:47.650
It was good.
I had the poached salmon Benedict.

05:47.651 --> 05:48.700
What?

05:48.701 --> 05:50.860
I had the poached
salmon Benedict!

05:50.861 --> 05:52.410
Have you ever had it with crab?!

05:52.411 --> 05:54.570
- What?!
- What?!

05:54.571 --> 05:55.701
This is ridiculous.

05:56.911 --> 05:58.530
We'll talk later!

05:58.531 --> 06:00.450
What?!

06:00.451 --> 06:02.321
Molly!

06:04.701 --> 06:05.700
Molly.

06:05.701 --> 06:07.860
What the hell are you doing?

06:07.861 --> 06:09.360
Waxing the floors.

06:09.361 --> 06:10.410
Why?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.320
'Cause I'm trying to stay busy

06:12.321 --> 06:15.360
in this cage
before my eyes go wonky.

06:15.361 --> 06:16.530
What?

06:16.531 --> 06:18.780
I'm just trying to take
my mind off of stuff.

06:18.781 --> 06:20.200
Have you tried meditation?

06:20.201 --> 06:22.200
Or getting real drunk?

06:22.201 --> 06:25.610
So when the adoption agency
calls, I'm gonna be blotto?

06:25.611 --> 06:27.361
Is that what you want?

06:28.701 --> 06:31.360
I can see my reflection.

06:31.361 --> 06:33.200
You're gonna have to start
wearing underwear in here.

06:33.201 --> 06:36.410
Why? I'm just as waxed
as this floor.

06:37.861 --> 06:40.200
Don't worry, Vince,
I'll get the door.

06:40.201 --> 06:43.361
All right, I figured
you want to keep busy.

06:44.651 --> 06:46.200
Is there a baby yet?

06:46.201 --> 06:47.610
Yeah, Peggy.

06:47.611 --> 06:49.651
Meet your grandchild.
He's right there on the couch.

06:51.241 --> 06:53.860
This whole adoption process
is ridiculous.

06:53.861 --> 06:55.450
You know, if you
were a celebrity,

06:55.451 --> 06:58.780
this house would be swimming
in Third World babies.

06:58.781 --> 07:00.030
Well, if you're open to that,
I know a guy

07:00.031 --> 07:01.860
who can get his hands
on just about anything.

07:01.861 --> 07:05.950
Got me the socks Saddam Hussein
was wearing when they hung him.

07:05.951 --> 07:07.610
Get out of here.

07:07.611 --> 07:08.910
No, I'm serious.

07:08.911 --> 07:10.700
I got the certificate of
authenticity and everything.

07:10.701 --> 07:12.241
No, get out of here.

07:12.991 --> 07:14.610
Get out of here.

07:14.611 --> 07:16.450
Get out of here!

07:16.451 --> 07:18.200
God, do you ever want
to just kill somebody?

07:18.201 --> 07:20.031
Everybody.
All the time.

07:22.781 --> 07:24.860
You know, I wouldn't say this
in front of Mike,

07:24.861 --> 07:27.820
but I'm starting to think
this is not gonna happen.

07:27.821 --> 07:29.240
Of course it's gonna happen.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.490
You don't know that.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.280
Yes, I do, 'cause I got faith.

07:32.281 --> 07:35.240
Which is exactly what you need.

07:35.241 --> 07:37.320
Grab your coat,
you're coming with me.

07:37.321 --> 07:40.030
- Where?
- I'm taking you to my friend's house.

07:40.031 --> 07:43.570
My buddy God
and his little boy Jesus.

07:43.571 --> 07:47.070
Oh, I-I appreciate
what you're doing,

07:47.071 --> 07:50.360
but, uh, I'm not really
tight with those guys.

07:50.361 --> 07:51.450
Well, I am.

07:51.451 --> 07:53.200
I've done a lot of
dirty work for our Lord.

07:53.201 --> 07:55.200
It's time for him to pay up.

07:55.201 --> 07:57.150
And bring your mother
and sister, too.

07:57.151 --> 08:00.201
You'll look better in his eyes
if they're next to you.

08:01.531 --> 08:04.200
Makes sense.
I mean...

08:04.201 --> 08:05.200
I get that.

08:05.201 --> 08:07.490
You know what?
Mom? Victoria?

08:07.491 --> 08:09.700
We're going to church!

08:09.701 --> 08:12.990
Please tell me that's
the name of a new club.

08:12.991 --> 08:15.110
No, it's the real deal.

08:15.111 --> 08:16.200
It's for the baby.

08:16.201 --> 08:18.031
I'll put on underwear.

08:28.031 --> 08:30.030
I feel a little
nervous being here.

08:30.031 --> 08:33.530
I've done some sinful
things in my life.

08:33.530 --> 08:36.740
I've done sinful things
in the last two hours.

08:36.741 --> 08:40.320
I know, Mom.
We have thin walls.

08:40.321 --> 08:44.030
It doesn't matter.
That's the beauty of religion.

08:44.030 --> 08:45.700
You can do all sorts
of unnatural acts

08:45.701 --> 08:47.320
and come in here and...

08:47.321 --> 08:48.491
clean-slate it.

08:50.111 --> 08:51.650
God is forgiving.

08:51.651 --> 08:53.701
Not the God I pray to.

08:54.531 --> 08:55.740
You want forgiveness?

08:55.741 --> 08:58.200
Go to the hippie Lutheran joint
down the street.

08:58.201 --> 09:01.490
The God that lives here
is angry and vengeful.

09:01.491 --> 09:03.700
Well, then is he really
the one to help us?

09:03.701 --> 09:08.490
Vince has got a guy who can get
us a baby and a 60-inch plasma.

09:08.491 --> 09:09.860
No, this is gonna work.

09:09.861 --> 09:10.860
You just got to do

09:10.861 --> 09:13.360
exactly as I say.

09:13.361 --> 09:15.950
Here.
A St. William Medal.

09:15.951 --> 09:18.610
Patron Saint of adoption.

09:18.611 --> 09:20.030
Are you seriously telling
me that if I wear that,

09:20.031 --> 09:21.110
I'm gonna get a baby?

09:21.111 --> 09:24.320
Don't be ridiculous,
it's not magic.

09:24.321 --> 09:26.280
You got to wear it
for a few days, spit on it,

09:26.281 --> 09:27.650
and bury it in the backyard.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.531
<i>Then</i> you get a baby.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.950
Oh, yeah,
that makes sense. Yeah.

09:32.951 --> 09:34.200
Anything we can do?

09:34.201 --> 09:37.070
A rain dance?
Jump in a volcano?

09:37.071 --> 09:40.361
You want to jump in a volcano,
I'm not going to stop you.

09:42.411 --> 09:43.950
Peggy, it's real sweet
of you to try to help,

09:43.951 --> 09:45.360
but I don't think Molly is,
like, really going to...

09:45.361 --> 09:47.820
Bup-bup-bup-bup.
Okay.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.860
How many days, how much spit,

09:49.861 --> 09:51.798
and how deep do I have
to bury it?

10:07.252 --> 10:09.461
I can't believe you
dragged me to this place.

10:09.462 --> 10:11.001
Just relax, okay?
We're gonna hear what she says,

10:11.002 --> 10:12.421
and if you don't like it,
we'll leave.

10:12.422 --> 10:14.501
That sounds like the same thing
you said when you tricked me

10:14.502 --> 10:16.291
into going to
that time-share thing.

10:16.292 --> 10:18.171
Man, we had to stay
until the first break

10:18.172 --> 10:19.972
or we wouldn't have got
the rolling suitcases.

10:21.212 --> 10:22.751
Hello, Carl.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.081
I see you brought a friend.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.791
Ah, I told you she was good.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.341
Uh, Mike, this is Madame Vianne.

10:27.342 --> 10:29.381
Madame Vianne, my best friend
and spiritual brother,

10:29.382 --> 10:30.381
Mike Biggs.

10:30.382 --> 10:31.631
Nice to meet you.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.341
But, just to be clear, uh,
I-I didn't want to come.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.711
Oh, I sensed that.

10:35.712 --> 10:37.292
- Mm, very intuitive.
- Shut up.

10:38.422 --> 10:39.841
But you wouldn't have
come at all

10:39.842 --> 10:41.582
unless you were
looking for answers.

10:42.712 --> 10:43.922
True.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.341
I sense there's a hole

10:47.342 --> 10:50.461
and you're waiting for
something to fill it.

10:50.462 --> 10:52.001
Something you fear
will never come.

10:52.002 --> 10:53.751
Mm-hmm.

10:53.752 --> 10:55.421
And it's not just affecting you,

10:55.422 --> 10:57.921
it's affecting someone
you love very much.

10:57.922 --> 10:59.501
Mm-hmm.

10:59.502 --> 11:00.921
And if this hole is filled,

11:00.922 --> 11:04.631
it will make the two of you
happier than you've ever been.

11:04.632 --> 11:06.341
Mm-hmm.

11:06.342 --> 11:08.421
Didn't I tell you she was good?

11:08.422 --> 11:09.422
Mm-hmm.

11:20.752 --> 11:22.921
Look, I'm just
gonna be straight.

11:22.922 --> 11:26.421
I, uh, I just jumped
on your bandwagon

11:26.422 --> 11:29.791
this afternoon,
but you know that and...

11:29.792 --> 11:33.171
Had my issues with you
in the past: the...

11:33.172 --> 11:35.631
the wars and the diseases.

11:35.632 --> 11:37.776
I mean, come on, the Cubs.

11:39.422 --> 11:42.131
But I think we can
put all that aside

11:42.132 --> 11:46.081
and just kind of
get Mama a baby.

11:46.082 --> 11:49.382
Amen. Please and...
thank you. Yes.

11:51.462 --> 11:52.711
- What are you doing?
- What?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.251
- Are you praying?
- No.

11:54.252 --> 11:56.581
Well, yeah, praying
that I find the earring

11:56.582 --> 11:57.921
that I dro...
Oh, you know what?

11:57.922 --> 12:00.211
It's right there.
Last place you ever look.

12:00.212 --> 12:03.421
Right in the old... ear.
How was your day?

12:03.422 --> 12:05.421
Good, good, good.
Yours?

12:05.422 --> 12:06.581
Good.

12:06.582 --> 12:07.631
Great.

12:07.632 --> 12:09.081
Excellent.

12:09.082 --> 12:11.171
- Did you talk to Jesus today?
- What?

12:11.172 --> 12:12.581
About fixing the front door?

12:12.582 --> 12:13.841
Oh, <i>Jesus.</i>

12:13.842 --> 12:15.631
- Yeah.
- Uh...

12:15.632 --> 12:18.211
No, I-I didn't
hear back from him.

12:18.212 --> 12:19.421
Well, it's like I always said,

12:19.422 --> 12:20.921
"It'll happen when it happens."

12:20.922 --> 12:21.921
- So true.
- Yeah.

12:21.922 --> 12:23.421
It's in his hands now.

12:23.422 --> 12:25.291
May he be guided
by the oracle of light.

12:25.292 --> 12:26.541
- What?
- What?

12:26.542 --> 12:28.251
Nothing, sweetie.

12:28.252 --> 12:30.251
- Good night.
- Okay.

12:30.252 --> 12:31.788
Good night.

12:38.752 --> 12:40.921
Are you as big of
a mess as I am?

12:40.922 --> 12:42.251
Worse.

12:42.252 --> 12:46.041
That makes me
feel so much better.

12:46.042 --> 12:47.082
- Night.
- Good night.

12:56.962 --> 12:58.961
Any word from
the adoption agency?

12:58.962 --> 13:02.171
No, but now I got
a $60 rock in my pocket

13:02.172 --> 13:03.751
that Madame Vianne says

13:03.752 --> 13:05.841
is supposed to attract
positive energy.

13:08.542 --> 13:10.381
Okay, first of all...

13:10.382 --> 13:13.212
it's not a rock.

13:15.582 --> 13:17.291
It's a amethyst, okay?

13:17.292 --> 13:19.461
And secondly, you're
supposed to be carrying it

13:19.462 --> 13:20.881
on your left side.

13:20.882 --> 13:23.882
It ain't no opal.
What are you thinking?

13:25.712 --> 13:26.921
I feel like a fool.

13:26.922 --> 13:28.081
You are not a fool.

13:28.082 --> 13:29.501
You're just a man
who wants a baby

13:29.502 --> 13:31.341
and you're gonna do whatever it
takes to make that happen.

13:31.342 --> 13:34.131
Even if it means listening
to some crazy gypsy.

13:34.132 --> 13:35.131
Gypsy?

13:35.132 --> 13:36.422
No, she's from Toronto.

13:38.502 --> 13:40.961
Wait, Madame Vianne?
That charlatan?

13:40.962 --> 13:43.541
Any amateur
magician could do what she does.

13:43.542 --> 13:44.961
Oh, you just got
sour grapes 'cause

13:44.962 --> 13:46.341
she said you'll
never get married.

13:46.342 --> 13:47.671
No.

13:47.672 --> 13:49.922
She didn't say "never,"
she said "not in this lifetime."

13:51.542 --> 13:53.632
Same as when I asked her out.

13:57.582 --> 13:59.461
What do you suppose
she meant when she said

13:59.462 --> 14:03.922
I would never receive a new love
until I let go of an old love?

14:05.632 --> 14:08.211
Don't you even think
of getting rid of me.

14:08.212 --> 14:11.581
Why not?
We had a good run.

14:11.582 --> 14:13.251
Hey, you've never had
a good run.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.252
Okay.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.922
See?
I can be hurtful, too.

14:19.082 --> 14:20.501
Yeah, I just don't get it.

14:20.502 --> 14:22.671
Molly and I have done everything
to get ready for this baby.

14:22.672 --> 14:24.921
We, uh, we got a crib,
a nursery, a Diaper Genie.

14:24.922 --> 14:26.381
I just... I went out and bought

14:26.382 --> 14:28.461
the safest car seat
on the market.

14:28.462 --> 14:30.461
Mm. Well, good luck
wedging it into the backseat

14:30.462 --> 14:31.461
of that muscle car.

14:31.462 --> 14:33.711
I've ridden back there.

14:33.712 --> 14:35.081
Never been more cramped.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.421
And I was smuggled into
this country in an oil drum.

14:39.382 --> 14:41.751
Look, quit trashing
the Challenger.

14:41.752 --> 14:43.581
It's a Hemi V-8
with a Scat Pack.

14:43.582 --> 14:46.081
470 horses under the hood.

14:46.082 --> 14:47.881
Might not be
a practical family car,

14:47.882 --> 14:50.252
but it's my baby and I love it.

14:58.252 --> 15:01.422
Knows all.
Sees all.

15:09.462 --> 15:12.461
Okay, we need to go
at least two feet deep.

15:12.462 --> 15:15.041
Then we bury St. William
and we don't dig him up

15:15.042 --> 15:17.421
until he gives us a child.

15:17.422 --> 15:20.381
Are you sure this is
sanctioned by the Church?

15:20.382 --> 15:22.961
Well, anything goes
with that new Pope,

15:22.962 --> 15:25.751
but, you know,
they bury St. Joseph

15:25.752 --> 15:27.171
when they want
to sell their house,

15:27.172 --> 15:29.341
so this just makes sense.

15:29.342 --> 15:30.921
Yeah, yeah, it kind of does.

15:30.922 --> 15:33.251
It feels right.

15:33.252 --> 15:34.631
Uh, two feet exactly,

15:34.632 --> 15:36.961
or who knows what
we're gonna conjure up.

15:36.962 --> 15:38.341
It's my first grandchild,

15:38.342 --> 15:41.131
I don't need it
to have cloven feet.

15:41.132 --> 15:44.791
I think you might be
more baby crazy than I am.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.421
- Oh, maybe I am.
- Yeah.

15:46.422 --> 15:49.252
I worked two jobs while
I was raising Mikey.

15:50.462 --> 15:52.581
He was usually asleep
before I got home.

15:52.582 --> 15:55.581
Couldn't even be there
to cook him a decent meal.

15:55.582 --> 15:59.501
Half the time he'd fix himself
a bowl of cereal for dinner.

15:59.502 --> 16:02.881
Well, I mean, you were
a single mom.

16:02.882 --> 16:05.212
Plus, he loves cereal.

16:06.252 --> 16:08.582
I just want another run at it
is all.

16:10.132 --> 16:12.131
I may not have been
the perfect mother,

16:12.132 --> 16:14.421
but... I'll tell you this:

16:14.422 --> 16:16.542
I'm gonna be
the best damn grandma.

16:18.462 --> 16:21.251
I don't doubt that.

16:21.252 --> 16:24.211
You shouldn't be so hard
on yourself, Peggy.

16:24.212 --> 16:26.001
I mean, you raised a good man.

16:26.002 --> 16:27.671
He's loving

16:27.672 --> 16:30.541
and kind and level-headed and...

16:35.792 --> 16:38.081
Mike, what is this?
Where is the Challenger?

16:38.082 --> 16:40.421
Don't worry, there's
a logical explanation.

16:40.422 --> 16:42.291
Carl's psychic convinced me
to trade it in

16:42.292 --> 16:44.461
so we can get a baby.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.381
You realize
that sounds ridiculous.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.041
Are we digging this hole or not?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.921
We'll talk later.
Your mom and I

16:50.922 --> 16:52.381
are burying a saint
in the backyard.

16:52.382 --> 16:54.042
That's how you get a baby.

16:56.882 --> 16:57.921
Well, what are you
talking to me for?

16:57.922 --> 16:59.581
- Get to digging!
- All right.

16:59.582 --> 17:01.211
Oh, here.
Toss in this magic rock.

17:01.212 --> 17:02.581
Can't hurt to hedge our bets.

17:02.582 --> 17:04.421
Hey, Ma.
Come check out the minivan.

17:04.422 --> 17:06.922
It's got 19 cup holders.

17:19.518 --> 17:21.186
Right when I spit in the hole,

17:21.188 --> 17:23.267
that's when I knew
I'd gone off the deep end.

17:24.518 --> 17:26.436
No, I went to Carl's psychic.

17:26.438 --> 17:28.227
Carl's psychic.

17:28.228 --> 17:30.017
Sit with that for a second.

17:30.018 --> 17:33.307
We have got to stop
acting like lunatics.

17:33.308 --> 17:34.847
Agreed.
Nothing we're gonna do

17:34.848 --> 17:36.887
is going to make this baby
happen any sooner.

17:36.888 --> 17:41.017
We've done all we can.
All we can do now is wait.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.057
Actually there is
something we can do.

17:43.058 --> 17:45.728
We can get out of this house
and away from that damn phone.

17:47.268 --> 17:48.267
Great idea.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.687
All right, want to hit
a drive-through,

17:49.688 --> 17:51.847
and have dinner
and a movie in the van?

17:51.848 --> 17:53.267
Does that have a DVD player?

17:53.268 --> 17:55.227
I have never been
more in love with you.

17:58.188 --> 18:00.057
That's got to be a telemarketer.

18:00.058 --> 18:02.347
Well, whoever it is,
they can leave a message,

18:02.348 --> 18:05.268
'cause I've got a date with
my man in the back of a van.

18:09.148 --> 18:12.597
This message is
for Mike Biggs and Molly Flynn.

18:12.598 --> 18:14.847
It's Isabelle
from the adoption center.

18:14.848 --> 18:17.807
Congratulations. We have
a mother who has selected you

18:17.808 --> 18:19.597
as the adoptive parents
of her baby.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.307
Uh, my number is 312...

18:22.308 --> 18:23.557
Don't hang up!
Don't hang up!

18:23.558 --> 18:25.558
Don't hang up!
