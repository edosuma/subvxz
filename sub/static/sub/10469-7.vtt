00:03.180 --> 00:05.060
Previously on Broadchurch...

00:05.340 --> 00:08.119
The burned boat was my
ex-brother-in-law's.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.279
Who knew about it? Everyone. It
wasn't a secret.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.320
You stay away.

00:12.296 --> 00:14.311
I know men who would rape you.

00:14.312 --> 00:16.471
You had sex with someone else. Why?

00:16.472 --> 00:20.071
Their dad, Mark... very quick to lie
about where he was.

00:20.072 --> 00:22.663
I'm worried about the phone? Did they
find anything on it?

00:22.664 --> 00:23.959
Get data off the handset?

00:23.960 --> 00:26.407
Nothing. Everything's forwarded to
another number.

00:26.408 --> 00:28.711
I saw him talking to the postman.

00:28.712 --> 00:31.591
You don't think I had anything to do
with it? I have insomnia.

00:31.592 --> 00:33.912
So I'm often up late, wandering.

00:34.472 --> 00:36.919
You rewrote
the whole bloody thing, stoked it up.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.079
Jack Marshall is a bloody
paedophile!

00:39.080 --> 00:41.095
There is an innocent man being
hounded

00:41.096 --> 00:42.679
and you need to do something.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.880
Certain he's innocent, eh?
Certain he's not?

01:09.464 --> 01:11.204
Get away from the water!

01:13.064 --> 01:14.804
Get away from the water!

01:16.520 --> 01:17.210
Get away!

01:20.840 --> 01:22.230
What are you doing?

01:23.864 --> 01:25.254
What are you doing?

01:26.888 --> 01:28.278
What are you doing?

01:28.328 --> 01:30.478
Get out of the water!

01:57.704 --> 01:58.924
They're bastards.

02:00.008 --> 02:01.591
We didn't hound him, they did.

02:01.592 --> 02:03.922
Now they're playing the innocent.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.919
If you want to come to the funeral,
you need a black tie.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.539
Erm, the Chief Super
is scaling our resources back.

02:11.960 --> 02:12.360
What?

02:13.832 --> 02:16.162
We've reached our budget ceiling.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.447
As of next week, pulling back on
staffing levels. She can't do that.

02:19.448 --> 02:22.039
Well, that's what happens
when a case drags on.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.647
Bosses lose confidence, panic about
explaining it to the accountants.

02:26.648 --> 02:28.231
Well, how are we meant to solve it?

02:28.232 --> 02:29.671
Chase forensics on the boat.

02:29.672 --> 02:33.415
The results are our last remaining
piece of clear evidence.

02:33.416 --> 02:36.871
They're doing as much as they can
but let me hassle them again.

02:36.872 --> 02:39.175
You don't have to come to this.

02:39.176 --> 02:41.386
What, cos of that? Bugger them.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.636
I'm the worst cop in Britain.

02:46.952 --> 02:48.679
Think they're right?
Yeah.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.270
I'll get you a T-shirt with it on.

02:53.144 --> 02:55.159
Danny's killer's likely to be there
today.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.751
Now he's two deaths on his
conscience, however indirect.

02:57.752 --> 03:00.072
Let's see who's looking worried.

03:00.776 --> 03:02.336
Welcome to St Bede's.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.511
We're gathered here...

03:03.512 --> 03:04.682
assembled here...

03:05.384 --> 03:08.004
We're assembled here today to grieve.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.970
We're gathered here... to share our
grief.

03:29.432 --> 03:35.047
It doesn't seem right, burying Jack when
they won't even let us have Danny's body.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.207
Not until they have the killer, Mum.

03:37.208 --> 03:39.348
But why haven't they got him?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.530
Can we not do this now?

03:43.400 --> 03:44.800
Mark?
Through here.

03:50.888 --> 03:53.047
I was thinking I might go back to
work.

03:53.048 --> 03:54.208
When?
Any time.

03:55.928 --> 03:59.095
Nige can't carry the load on his
own, can he?

03:59.096 --> 04:00.967
It's autumn. It's a busy time.

04:00.968 --> 04:02.298
We need the money.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.719
What do you think?
I hadn't really thought about it.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.463
I mean, I could stay. No, no, you're
right. We need the money.

04:09.464 --> 04:11.767
I just got used to you being at home.

04:11.768 --> 04:13.508
You still have me, love.

04:14.072 --> 04:17.095
Or you could go back to the Tourist
Information.

04:17.096 --> 04:20.406
Have the dead boy's mum give you
directions? I don't think so.

04:20.408 --> 04:21.438
I'll be fine.

04:21.704 --> 04:23.084
I've plenty to do.

04:25.016 --> 04:26.926
No, no way.
I said black.

04:27.464 --> 04:29.194
I didn't even like him.

04:35.096 --> 04:36.546
Sorry, we're closed.

04:43.592 --> 04:45.262
Look at you in a suit.

04:47.336 --> 04:50.176
I didn't expect to see you. Not
today.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.730
How are you doing, Olly?
Good.

04:54.968 --> 04:56.528
I did call. And text.

04:57.272 --> 04:58.842
And email. Also Skype.

04:59.288 --> 05:00.727
Yeah, it's been a mad time at work

05:00.728 --> 05:02.743
since they pulled me back.
Yeah, I know.

05:02.744 --> 05:07.524
I've beenlooking out for your
by-lines, keeping up with your stuff.

05:13.544 --> 05:16.855
I mean, it is a little bit tacky not
to call.

05:16.856 --> 05:18.546
I was embarrassed.
Why?

05:19.160 --> 05:21.895
After they found Jack Marshall
I couldn't stand being here,

05:21.896 --> 05:23.479
being part of the frenzy.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.810
So you ran?
Yeah.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.799
Hid, with a mate in Wales for four
days.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.710
It wasn't our fault, Olly.

05:30.536 --> 05:34.135
Let's just keep telling ourselves
that. Right, Olly.

05:34.136 --> 05:35.516
Let's make a move.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.810
The Invisible Woman returns.

05:40.184 --> 05:42.055
Are you sure you should be here?

05:42.056 --> 05:43.783
I felt I should pay my respects,
yeah.

05:43.784 --> 05:45.655
Should have done that while he was
alive.

05:45.656 --> 05:47.527
Or come to wash the blood off your
hands?

05:47.528 --> 05:49.255
Spare me the sanctimonious shit.

05:49.256 --> 05:51.847
Jack Marshall made his own decision,
took his own life.

05:51.848 --> 05:54.295
He was hounded.
And what did you do?

05:54.296 --> 05:55.856
Did you bring him in?

05:56.024 --> 05:57.895
Did the police protect him? No.

05:57.896 --> 06:00.487
Your little town
turned on him quite happily.

06:00.488 --> 06:05.959
You've still got a murderer walking
round out there and you want to blame me?

06:05.960 --> 06:07.570
It's good to be back.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.079
We're assembled here today
to share our grief.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.640
And to celebrate the life
of Jack Gerald Marshall.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.559
Jack Marshall was a good man.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.580
As has been made clear since his
death, an innocent man.

07:08.024 --> 07:10.615
The local newsagent and Sea Brigade
Master

07:10.616 --> 07:14.166
who kept children secure on land
and safe at sea.

07:15.224 --> 07:16.664
So how are we here?

07:17.384 --> 07:20.124
We let him be smeared and
intimidated.

07:20.552 --> 07:23.102
We weren't there when he needed us.

07:23.288 --> 07:29.118
So, today, in celebrating Jack, we also
have to admit that some of us failed him.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.790
Just as we failed Danny Latimer.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.303
The Second Commandment tells us,
"Love thy neighbour as thyself. "

07:43.304 --> 07:47.084
In this, the darkest of times,
we have to be better.

07:47.480 --> 07:51.850
If we are not a community of
neighbours, then we are nothing.

08:04.472 --> 08:06.343
Do you think the killer's here?

08:06.344 --> 08:08.503
A good chance. So keep an eye...

08:08.504 --> 08:11.383
Keep an eye out, look out for
anything out of the ordinary. Got it.

08:11.384 --> 08:12.944
Do I urk you, Miller?

08:12.968 --> 08:15.998
Seriously, you're only asking me that
now?

08:17.864 --> 08:18.964
Well done, you.

08:19.304 --> 08:20.599
You gave us all what for.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.335
I'm a bit worried
no-one's going to speak to me again.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.066
I'll speak to you.
Nice bit of community leadership.

08:27.368 --> 08:29.458
Thank you. Just doing my job.

08:31.256 --> 08:32.066
Hey.
Hiya.

08:32.408 --> 08:33.217
Hey.
Mark.

08:33.703 --> 08:34.855
Good to see you both.

08:34.856 --> 08:38.023
I'll have a white wine
and a beer for my husband.

08:38.024 --> 08:38.833
Sure thing.

08:48.968 --> 08:51.468
Paul, Beth and I changed our minds.

08:51.704 --> 08:54.151
We don't want a memorial service any
more.

08:54.152 --> 08:57.319
We want a proper funeral, you know?
When it's all done.

08:57.320 --> 09:01.495
Then we'd like you to speak,
do what you did today, you know.

09:01.496 --> 09:04.087
Whatever you want. Yeah, I'll be
there.

09:04.088 --> 09:04.608
Thanks.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.119
That was a bit of a lecture back
there, wasn't it?

09:08.120 --> 09:09.847
Tore a strip off the town.

09:09.848 --> 09:13.015
Not really. Unless you were worried
it was directed at you.

09:13.016 --> 09:14.746
Was it?
I came to you.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.272
I told you that Jack needed
protecting.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.520
You did nothing.

09:27.416 --> 09:29.287
You must be Lil. Hi, I'm Paul.

09:29.288 --> 09:32.167
Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

09:41.096 --> 09:44.586
Could write the bloody book.
Put this on my tab.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.144
Bloody cash bar.

09:47.864 --> 09:49.735
What did you find on Susan Wright?

09:49.736 --> 09:52.327
We looked into it. I don't think
anything was flagged up.

09:52.328 --> 09:54.631
You don't think?
I wasn't on it. Someone else was.

09:54.632 --> 09:57.223
I had hoped this would get
your personal attention.

09:57.224 --> 09:59.239
I'm in the middle of a murder
inquiry.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.140
I'm sure you can look into it
yourself.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.320
Whoa, there.

10:23.432 --> 10:25.062
Whoa, there, big fella.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.175
Hey, come on. One too many, is it?

10:27.176 --> 10:28.666
I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.130
What's going on?

10:33.800 --> 10:38.380
I've a favour to ask. Beth, I'm not
reporting on this any more.

10:38.408 --> 10:42.151
Until the killer's caught,
the news desk won't feature it.

10:42.152 --> 10:44.402
I know it's brutal. I'm sorry.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.471
I just want to know what happens to
us now.

10:46.472 --> 10:49.063
How do you mean? I want to know what
it's like from now on.

10:49.064 --> 10:50.791
Well, how do I help you with that?

10:50.792 --> 10:54.247
You know the families from Sandbrook
who lost their girls.

10:54.248 --> 10:57.271
I want to talk to them, to someone
who knows what this is like.

10:57.272 --> 10:59.652
Can you arrange that for me?
OK.

11:01.880 --> 11:02.220
Hey.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.532
Is that Paul that I saw you with?
Yeah.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.880
You get on with him, do you?

11:13.976 --> 11:15.886
Did Danny get on with him?

11:15.992 --> 11:17.442
Um, yeah, I suppose.

11:19.736 --> 11:22.006
And did they ever talk privately

11:22.184 --> 11:26.144
or did they ever meet up outside of
the computer class?

11:26.792 --> 11:28.532
Well, I didn't really...

11:28.808 --> 11:30.198
What are you doing?

11:30.392 --> 11:31.687
We're just talking.

11:31.688 --> 11:32.488
I hope so.

11:34.712 --> 11:36.007
Are you all right?

11:36.008 --> 11:39.078
Yeah, I'm just going to go and play
this.

11:41.192 --> 11:41.942
Excuse me.

12:00.056 --> 12:02.496
Where are you going?
Oh, hi, Tom.

12:02.936 --> 12:06.391
If my mum and dad ask where I am,
just say I've gone to the loo, OK?

12:06.392 --> 12:06.732
Why?

12:07.544 --> 12:09.454
Because I'm asking you to.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.295
Because I'm Danny's sister
and you're his best friend.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.599
OK? What does everyone keep saying
that?

12:14.600 --> 12:17.479
I'm not his best friend. I hated him.
Whoa, take it easy.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.660
And you know what, I'm glad he's
dead. Tom!

12:21.368 --> 12:22.638
Come on. Come on.

12:24.968 --> 12:25.598
Come on.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.040
Oh, yeah, nine, nine. Skills from
Lee.

12:42.468 --> 12:44.268
Right, Tom, nine to beat.

12:46.644 --> 12:47.104
Hello.

12:48.084 --> 12:51.395
I was worried when I woke up. I didn't
know where you were till I got the note.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.419
Yeah, well, Tom was up at, like, six
and he wanted to come down here.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.723
They do this every morning now
before school.

12:56.724 --> 12:58.814
And I am the official scorer.

12:59.604 --> 12:59.944
Tom.

13:01.332 --> 13:02.422
That's a nine.

13:02.484 --> 13:06.274
Yeah, dead heat.
All right, it goes to another round.

13:06.516 --> 13:07.906
Are you having fun?

13:08.244 --> 13:10.574
Anything to lighten the mood, eh?

13:11.556 --> 13:14.456
How are you doing? You were a bit
um...

13:14.724 --> 13:16.074
.. distant yesterday.

13:16.308 --> 13:19.043
I was just looking round that bar at
the wake thinking,

13:19.044 --> 13:22.054
"It's someone here. Why can't I see
it? "

13:22.212 --> 13:25.379
The longer it goes on, I'm just
starting to suspect everyone.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.070
When you say everyone...

13:27.678 --> 13:29.117
Well, nearly everyone.

13:29.118 --> 13:34.157
Shame, cos I am available for rigorous
questioning in our bedroom every evening.

13:34.158 --> 13:37.613
And bring your handcuffs cos I can
be quite a troublesome prisoner.

13:37.614 --> 13:40.493
Oh, Dad, get a room.
You're supposed to be scoring.

13:40.494 --> 13:42.077
Right, I'd better go to work.

13:42.078 --> 13:44.957
See you later. I'll bring the
handcuffs.

13:44.958 --> 13:45.888
Oh, promises.

13:53.454 --> 13:55.757
How are you feeling about first day
back, Chlo?

13:55.758 --> 13:56.968
You want a lift?

13:57.054 --> 14:00.077
I'm going to meet Jess and the
others. They're going to walk me in.

14:00.078 --> 14:02.237
She hasn't eaten.
You've got to eat, Chlo.

14:02.238 --> 14:04.685
I'm not hungry.
Just a slice of toast. Or a banana.

14:04.686 --> 14:05.786
No time. Going.

14:06.602 --> 14:08.052
See you later.
Bye.

14:08.186 --> 14:11.186
I'll pick you up at the end of the
day.

14:13.658 --> 14:15.568
Think she'll be all right?

14:15.962 --> 14:18.265
I don't know. Will you, back at
work?

14:18.266 --> 14:20.116
I'm always all right, me.

14:21.290 --> 14:25.321
Are you going to go and see your mum
today? Yeah. I've plenty to do.

14:25.322 --> 14:28.057
When are we going to talk about the
baby?

14:28.058 --> 14:28.808
Not today.

14:29.498 --> 14:31.657
You've been saying that for a month
and a half.

14:31.658 --> 14:33.961
We've got to plan, one way or
another.

14:33.962 --> 14:37.382
Have a good day at work.
Give my love to Nige.

14:53.114 --> 14:55.974
Toast? Don't you get breakfast
included?

14:55.994 --> 14:59.449
Know what I did last night, Miller?
Dressed up as Lady Gaga?

14:59.450 --> 15:00.960
I followed the vicar.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.761
Paul Coates? What did you do that
for?

15:02.762 --> 15:05.497
I thought, he likes a walk of an
evening. I wonder where.

15:05.498 --> 15:08.521
Except yesterday evening he didn't
walk. He drove.

15:08.522 --> 15:09.272
To Yeovil.

15:10.394 --> 15:13.273
Over the border to darkest Somerset.
All that way for a meeting.

15:13.274 --> 15:16.134
What sort of meeting?
A meeting meeting.

15:16.154 --> 15:19.465
Alcoholics Anonymous.
Our young vicar is an alcoholic.

15:19.466 --> 15:22.201
Well, recovering alcoholic
if he's going to meetings.

15:22.202 --> 15:23.929
Seems interesting.
Maybe.

15:23.930 --> 15:27.817
Maybe? Suspect alcoholics and you'll
have to include half this station.

15:27.818 --> 15:30.121
He didn't mention it.
Didn't think it relevant?

15:30.122 --> 15:33.001
I want everything on him.
Last parish, old girlfriends.

15:33.002 --> 15:36.313
Overdue library books. And what goes
on in that computer class.

15:36.314 --> 15:38.905
What's this? Forensics report on the
burnt-out boat.

15:38.906 --> 15:41.209
Blood, hair and prints matching
Danny's.

15:41.210 --> 15:44.953
And paint chips matching the colour
of Danny's skateboard.

15:44.954 --> 15:48.265
What were they doing
with Danny's skateboard on the boat?

15:48.266 --> 15:51.577
And traces of a cleaning product,
the same one used on Danny's body.

15:51.578 --> 15:53.737
They were transporting Danny
down the coast.

15:53.738 --> 15:56.473
The killer tried to clean off any
traces left on the body.

15:56.474 --> 15:59.929
It was a domestic cleaning product
nicked from supplies in the hut.

15:59.930 --> 16:02.665
Which leads us to believe it wasn't
planned, any of this.

16:02.666 --> 16:05.545
Boat nicked from the beach,
cleaning fluid nicked from the hut.

16:05.546 --> 16:07.416
The killer was improvising.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.680
Who, um... Who knew that the boat
was moored there?

16:14.042 --> 16:17.785
It wasn't a secret. Pretty much
anyone who walked down on the beach.

16:17.786 --> 16:20.233
And when did you last use it?
Oh, ages back.

16:20.234 --> 16:20.634
Um...

16:21.962 --> 16:26.281
We went paintballing down the coast,
with Tom and Danny six months back maybe.

16:26.282 --> 16:28.441
It was that really hot weekend in
March, I think.

16:28.442 --> 16:30.025
Tom's never been paintballing.

16:30.026 --> 16:31.753
Oh, no, yeah, that's right.

16:31.754 --> 16:34.633
Mark asked Joe because he knew you'd
say no to Tom using weapons.

16:34.634 --> 16:35.034
What?

16:35.786 --> 16:39.216
So it was me, Tom, Danny,
Nige Carter and Mark.

16:39.962 --> 16:42.841
It was a legendary day. I've still
got the pictures.

16:42.842 --> 16:45.433
It's probably the last day
I spent any time with Danny.

16:45.434 --> 16:48.169
So all these people knew about the
boat.

16:48.170 --> 16:50.560
Knew how the motor started.
Yeah.

16:51.050 --> 16:52.970
Who else?
Loads of people.

16:53.498 --> 16:55.945
I mean, Mum lets people borrow it
for cash.

16:55.946 --> 16:58.393
Everyone's had a go at one time or
another.

16:58.394 --> 17:01.417
Brian, from the King's Arms.
Kevin the postman.

17:01.418 --> 17:03.721
At least three of Tom's teachers.

17:03.722 --> 17:04.882
Paul Coates too.

17:06.314 --> 17:08.054
Olly's boat? Yeah, once.

17:09.914 --> 17:12.073
Probably more than a year ago now.

17:12.074 --> 17:17.784
I thought, you know, being as I was here,
I should be a bit more fishermanly...

17:18.266 --> 17:22.096
So I took the boat and a rod
and I caught... nothing.

17:26.185 --> 17:28.106
Got a nice sunburn, though.

17:28.202 --> 17:31.942
How long have you been
going to Alcoholics Anonymous?

17:35.690 --> 17:37.849
Explain to me why that's a relevant
question.

17:37.850 --> 17:40.441
Explain to me why it's not.
Oh, I see.

17:40.442 --> 17:43.897
I make a complaint about your failings
with Jack and you come after me?

17:43.898 --> 17:45.578
Not at all. Why Yeovil?

17:45.914 --> 17:49.945
So I can be anonymous, have privacy,
and not bump into parishioners.

17:49.946 --> 17:53.113
Why didn't you tell us? It's nothing
to do with your investigation.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.417
Were you drinking the night of
Danny's death?

17:55.418 --> 17:58.018
I haven't had a drink for 473 days.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.897
He always this objectionable?
He's excelling himself.

18:01.898 --> 18:06.073
In your last job, you assaulted
a child after you'd been drinking.

18:06.074 --> 18:07.634
I didn't assault him.

18:07.946 --> 18:09.796
It was a joke gone wrong.

18:09.962 --> 18:11.522
He was twice my size.

18:11.690 --> 18:15.290
You have no alibi for the night of
Danny's death.

18:17.306 --> 18:18.866
Why would I kill him?

18:21.482 --> 18:26.892
What possible reason can you dream up
for me to murder an 11-year-old boy?

18:31.274 --> 18:34.414
Come in and provide a DNA sample,
will you?

19:08.282 --> 19:10.742
It stands for Deoxyribonucleic acid.

19:13.034 --> 19:14.424
A really long word.

19:14.474 --> 19:16.844
It's in every cell in your body.

19:45.866 --> 19:47.593
.. get that definition down, please.

19:47.594 --> 19:48.694
It's important.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.228
You definitely need to have that.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.321
Hey.
You sure you're all right, mate?

20:07.322 --> 20:09.769
That's the fourth time you've asked
me that.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.497
I have done this before, you know?

20:11.498 --> 20:13.369
I know, but things are different
now.

20:13.370 --> 20:17.113
Nige, the whole reason I'm doing this is
so I can forget everything's different.

20:17.114 --> 20:17.864
All right.

20:19.850 --> 20:20.890
Oh, God, Mark.

20:21.578 --> 20:25.228
No, God's busy, so it's just me this
time, Nicky.

20:25.322 --> 20:27.362
Washing machine again, is it?

20:28.058 --> 20:28.858
He's fine.

20:39.290 --> 20:41.161
I recognise you from your photo.

20:41.162 --> 20:42.032
Cate.
Beth.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.604
Same. I recognised you straight away.

20:46.634 --> 20:48.494
Wow. This is weird, right?

20:49.658 --> 20:50.058
Yeah.

20:53.402 --> 20:56.281
Karen said that you've got DI Hardy
in charge.

20:56.282 --> 20:57.502
Yeah.
God, Beth.

20:58.154 --> 21:00.014
Listen, that man is toxic.

21:00.602 --> 21:03.481
They lost evidence, they ballsed up
the trial.

21:03.482 --> 21:07.081
My daughter's killer is still out
there because of that man.

21:07.082 --> 21:09.702
Do not believe anything he says.
OK.

21:09.962 --> 21:14.012
God... There's so much I want to
tell you but I can't.

21:15.290 --> 21:18.169
Listen, I'm sorry for what you're
going through.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.740
I understand the pain.

21:20.186 --> 21:23.209
You're the first person to say that
I've properly believed.

21:23.210 --> 21:23.780
I know.

21:24.794 --> 21:28.393
Do you get people who are so desperate
to tell you how deeply they feel your pain

21:28.394 --> 21:31.129
and you're thinking, "Piss off.
You haven't got a clue. "

21:31.130 --> 21:33.289
Yeah, it's like they stick to you.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.305
They're so desperate for you to be
grateful.

21:35.306 --> 21:39.376
And they haven't got a clue about
grief. Not real grief.

21:39.770 --> 21:41.040
Not like this is.

21:42.650 --> 21:43.110
Nicky.

21:43.802 --> 21:49.982
I used to assume grief was something inside
you could fight and vanquish but it's not.

21:51.290 --> 21:52.970
It's an external thing.

21:53.306 --> 21:54.346
Like a shadow.

21:54.746 --> 21:58.516
You can't escape it. You just have
to live with it.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.530
And it doesn't grow any smaller.

22:04.394 --> 22:07.354
You just come to accept that it's
there.

22:10.298 --> 22:12.745
I kind of grew fond of it after a
while.

22:12.746 --> 22:15.586
Is that mad? Am I too bleak too
quick?

22:16.490 --> 22:20.610
You're like the first person I've met
to talk any sense.

22:21.242 --> 22:23.272
What's it been, eight weeks?

22:25.418 --> 22:26.698
Marriage still OK?

22:27.290 --> 22:28.500
Um, up and down.

22:29.882 --> 22:30.222
You?

22:32.330 --> 22:32.970
Divorced.

22:35.066 --> 22:38.953
Most couples with a murdered child
divorce. You know that, right?

22:38.954 --> 22:41.504
Um, my husband's gone back to work.

22:42.122 --> 22:44.322
Wow. He didn't waste any time.

22:46.298 --> 22:50.329
There's the man for you. Has to do
things, can't bear to be thinking.

22:50.330 --> 22:53.820
And my daughter, she's back at school
as well...

22:54.218 --> 22:56.809
I don't want to go back to work.
It doesn't feel right.

22:56.810 --> 22:57.850
Of course not.

22:58.106 --> 23:02.713
I keep feeling like I wish there was
a handbook for this, a guide.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.264
Cos minute to minute, what do I do?

23:10.634 --> 23:13.294
I don't know, Beth.
What do you do?

23:13.658 --> 23:17.689
I worked for a bit but got terrible
headaches. I couldn't concentrate.

23:17.690 --> 23:20.850
And also that nagging sense of
pointlessness.

23:21.290 --> 23:23.593
"What does it matter if I don't
finish this work?

23:23.594 --> 23:25.321
The worst has already happened. "

23:25.322 --> 23:28.222
So how do you keep busy during the
day?

23:31.658 --> 23:32.298
Honestly?

23:36.122 --> 23:37.732
I go to bed. I sleep.

23:39.146 --> 23:43.606
Then when I wake up and it's still
the same, I have a drink.

23:43.754 --> 23:45.384
And then another drink.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.361
Then I cry, for a couple of hours
maybe.

23:48.362 --> 23:49.572
Then I watch TV.

23:50.666 --> 23:52.537
Unless it reminds me of my little
girl.

23:52.538 --> 23:53.578
Which it does.

23:54.122 --> 23:56.322
And so I take a sleeping pill.

23:57.434 --> 24:01.284
I'm sorry. You probably came here
looking for answers.

24:02.906 --> 24:04.201
I don't have them.

24:04.202 --> 24:06.232
My life got stolen that day.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.774
The best part of me was killed.

24:10.106 --> 24:12.416
And I can't get back from that.

24:15.290 --> 24:17.550
Maybe you'll do better than me.

24:47.114 --> 24:47.514
Paul.

24:48.986 --> 24:50.146
Oh, hello, mate.

24:50.282 --> 24:52.153
I wanted to ask you something.
Sure.

24:52.154 --> 24:57.884
If someone accidentally deletes something
from a hard drive, is it gone for ever?

24:57.914 --> 25:00.554
My dad accidentally deleted
something.

25:00.794 --> 25:02.809
No, there are recovery programmes.

25:02.810 --> 25:06.121
If that doesn't work, a tech expert
can probably get it back.

25:06.122 --> 25:06.932
OK. Thanks.

25:08.570 --> 25:10.710
I won't charge you this time.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.670
Yeah?
Mark.

25:27.528 --> 25:30.695
Chloe left school at lunchtime
and she didn't come home.

25:30.696 --> 25:31.505
They let her?

25:31.506 --> 25:33.521
Well, she told them she had an
agreement

25:33.522 --> 25:35.799
she only had to do half days at the
beginning.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.679
You're joking? Her phone's going
straight to answerphone.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.551
She's not at home, she's not with
Mum.

25:40.552 --> 25:44.602
I don't know where she is.
It's all right. I'm coming.

25:45.736 --> 25:47.751
She's got a what?
Boyfriend.

25:47.752 --> 25:49.662
Since when?
I don't know.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.647
When were you going to tell me about
it?

25:52.648 --> 25:56.247
I forgot. It was happening when all
that Jack Marshall stuff was kicking off.

25:56.248 --> 25:58.839
There was a lot going on.
You and I were barely talking.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.719
So you like this Dean?
Did she meet him at school or what?

26:01.720 --> 26:03.330
No. He's a bit older.

26:05.032 --> 26:06.132
How much older?

26:06.328 --> 26:06.608
17.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.890
Brilliant. Brilliant.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.359
And you're all right with this?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.519
I'm far from bloody all right with
it.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.967
But I don't want to push her away
right now, do I?

26:14.968 --> 26:16.839
And you don't even have this 17...

26:16.840 --> 26:20.151
He's lives on a farm past Bredy Hill,
all right?

26:20.152 --> 26:23.463
She'll be there and I'm sure she'll
be all right.

26:23.464 --> 26:25.664
How can you ever say that now?

26:41.608 --> 26:42.538
Dean!
Chloe!

26:43.336 --> 26:44.386
Chloe, darling!

26:48.520 --> 26:51.100
Chloe. Chloe.

26:53.560 --> 26:54.250
Mum, Dad.

26:54.712 --> 26:56.727
What the hell are you doing?

26:56.728 --> 26:57.308
Dancing.

27:02.056 --> 27:03.783
Dean made me a happy room.

27:03.784 --> 27:07.224
A what? Somewhere she can just shut
herself away.

27:07.816 --> 27:10.396
Enjoy herself without feeling
guilty.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.690
What happened at school?

27:16.024 --> 27:17.194
Everybody stared.

27:18.472 --> 27:19.912
Like I was a freak.

27:20.776 --> 27:22.791
I rang Dean. He came and got me.

27:22.792 --> 27:24.951
I just wanted a break from being
sad.

27:24.952 --> 27:27.111
I loved Danny. You know I loved him.

27:27.112 --> 27:30.942
But I need a break from being
the dead boy's sister.

27:31.432 --> 27:34.167
It's suffocating me and I know you
can't understand that.

27:34.168 --> 27:36.188
No, we do. Of course we do.

27:36.472 --> 27:37.682
Don't we?
Yeah.

27:39.496 --> 27:41.296
Are you keeping the baby?

27:43.240 --> 27:47.480
How do you know? For God's sake,
Mum, I heard you fighting.

27:52.024 --> 27:54.394
It won't take long. Have a seat.

28:04.264 --> 28:06.567
Did you eat or drink anything
in the last hour?

28:06.568 --> 28:06.848
No.

28:14.776 --> 28:15.936
Open your mouth.

28:21.112 --> 28:23.972
So, what - religion took over the
booze?

28:26.152 --> 28:28.952
Swap one addiction for another, was
it?

28:31.048 --> 28:33.948
You enjoy trying to rile me, don't
you?

28:34.360 --> 28:35.350
Yes, probably.

28:37.528 --> 28:39.618
What have you got against me?

28:39.976 --> 28:40.616
Honestly?

28:43.000 --> 28:43.980
You worry me.

28:45.448 --> 28:48.759
You were so eager to get in front of
the camera when this all kicked off,

28:48.760 --> 28:51.639
like you wanted to own it
and claim it for the church.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.519
You were in the Latimers' like a fly
in shite.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.535
Wow.
I watch this happen every time.

28:56.536 --> 29:00.156
A terrible event and the church
piles in gleefully.

29:00.712 --> 29:03.447
Cos suddenly people are paying you
attention.

29:03.448 --> 29:06.327
For the rest of the year, you're
just that building nobody goes in.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.998
You have no concept of faith, do you?

29:10.792 --> 29:13.383
I didn't muscle in. People turned to
me.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.543
People who wouldn't think about
religion.

29:15.544 --> 29:18.567
They asked me to speak.
They asked me to listen.

29:18.568 --> 29:20.871
They needed me. Do you know why?

29:20.872 --> 29:23.242
Do you know why they came to me?

29:23.320 --> 29:26.343
Because there was a fear
that you couldn't address,

29:26.344 --> 29:27.783
a gap that you couldn't plug.

29:27.784 --> 29:30.087
Because all you have is suspicion

29:30.088 --> 29:33.878
and an urge to blame
whoever is in closest proximity.

29:35.416 --> 29:38.736
Look, you can accuse me,
you can take samples,

29:39.592 --> 29:41.607
belittle who I was in the past,

29:41.608 --> 29:45.351
but you do not get to belittle my
faith just because you have none!

29:45.352 --> 29:50.662
People need hope right now and they
are certainly not getting it from you.

29:52.696 --> 29:53.616
Are we done?

29:54.424 --> 29:57.964
No, petal, I didn't die.
I just moved to Dorset.

29:58.024 --> 30:02.114
Looking for anything from your
archives on a Susan Wright,

30:02.632 --> 30:04.791
any time between 1985 and 2000.

30:04.792 --> 30:06.951
There's a bottle of Jameson's in it
for you.

30:06.952 --> 30:09.862
Uh... I'll email all my details
through.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.135
Ring me when you've had a look
through it.

30:12.136 --> 30:13.816
OK. Love to the family.

30:14.728 --> 30:17.319
Ah, Olly, haven't got any plans for
tonight, have you?

30:17.320 --> 30:19.767
Yes, I was going to meet...
Good. Put your bag down.

30:19.768 --> 30:23.508
Help me finish looking through
this old Rolodex here.

30:24.088 --> 30:29.127
If the police won't follow up on Susan
Wright, we'll have to do it ourselves.

30:29.128 --> 30:32.871
We'll be like Woodward and Bernstein.
Are they like Morecambe and Wise?

30:32.872 --> 30:34.492
God, I hate the young.

30:35.032 --> 30:35.432
Yeah?

30:37.048 --> 30:39.308
It's Finley's last day.
Right.

30:40.504 --> 30:42.484
Which one's Finley?
Tall...

30:42.664 --> 30:44.594
dark hair, lopsided haircut.

30:44.680 --> 30:45.600
Oh, him. OK.

30:46.120 --> 30:49.950
They're all going to the pub for a
quick drink. Yeah.

30:50.872 --> 30:52.842
No. I have stuff to... um...

30:54.472 --> 30:55.292
Obviously...

30:57.352 --> 30:59.902
Get him a round or something on me.

31:00.232 --> 31:03.255
Sure you don't want to?
Not really. Too much stuff here.

31:03.256 --> 31:06.279
It's probably more like 30 for a
full round.

31:06.280 --> 31:06.970
Oh... OK.

31:08.296 --> 31:08.696
Er...

31:10.456 --> 31:13.026
You all right?
Yep.

31:13.624 --> 31:15.184
Not even a quick one?

31:15.928 --> 31:16.798
Tell... um...

31:17.944 --> 31:19.874
Finley.
Finley. Tell him...

31:21.688 --> 31:22.438
Well done.

31:23.560 --> 31:24.950
He'll be overjoyed.

31:30.184 --> 31:31.794
He's got you a round.

31:42.856 --> 31:44.476
Hey, it's me.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.751
Just checking in with your voicemail,
as usual.

31:47.752 --> 31:50.631
If you get a chance, give me a call.
It's been a long time.

31:50.632 --> 31:55.282
I mean, I know... I know you're busy
with school and home and...

31:55.384 --> 31:57.687
.. all the other things you do, but...

31:57.688 --> 32:00.008
I do think about you. Every day.

32:01.144 --> 32:04.743
Sorry. Not getting soppy. Sorry.
You had my word on that.

32:04.744 --> 32:05.144
Um...

32:06.328 --> 32:08.938
We could do video call, couldn't we?

32:10.072 --> 32:12.807
I'd like that.
You could be my first video call.

32:12.808 --> 32:15.308
Before you forget what I look like.

32:16.264 --> 32:17.944
Right, well, that's me.

32:18.424 --> 32:20.164
This is Dad signing off.

32:21.736 --> 32:23.186
I love you, darling.

32:25.048 --> 32:26.668
Please give me a ring.

33:21.496 --> 33:23.367
Who still uses a fax?

33:23.368 --> 33:27.378
Terry here would still use ink wells
if they'd let him.

33:30.712 --> 33:34.887
But I'll tell you what. He knows
where to find anything you need.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.458
Golden, this is, Olly.

34:17.800 --> 34:18.550
Come here.

34:19.239 --> 34:20.170
Vince. Vince.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.310
Hello again. Remember me?

34:27.447 --> 34:28.547
Susan.
Oh, hi.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.038
You're out early.

34:33.928 --> 34:35.608
Yeah, I'm just walking.

34:37.815 --> 34:39.496
You want to be careful.

34:40.120 --> 34:43.199
You know this is near where that boy
died.

34:43.288 --> 34:44.148
I knew him.

34:45.304 --> 34:47.094
He used to be my friend.

34:48.616 --> 34:50.005
Sorry to hear that.

34:50.199 --> 34:50.719
Thanks.

34:54.808 --> 34:56.297
It's Tom, isn't it?

34:56.824 --> 34:57.224
Yeah.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.743
Uh, do you want to come
and feed Vince with me?

35:04.744 --> 35:06.534
He'll love you for ever.

35:11.080 --> 35:11.760
OK.

35:12.088 --> 35:13.128
Come on, then.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.040
Here we are.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.159
There's a good boy!
There's a good boy!

35:32.160 --> 35:32.790
Come on.

35:37.776 --> 35:38.576
In you go.

35:39.648 --> 35:43.648
Come on, in you go. Good boy.
There you go. That's it.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.200
I've got a selection.

36:02.232 --> 36:03.742
Go on. Help yourself.

36:04.824 --> 36:07.194
Don't just take one. Take a few.

36:09.144 --> 36:10.184
There you are.

36:12.168 --> 36:13.148
He likes you.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.519
Um, you said I could take him
out for a walk some time?

36:20.520 --> 36:22.260
Yeah. Of course you can.

36:23.112 --> 36:25.415
Well, you know where we are now.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.966
You can take him any time you like.

36:31.032 --> 36:33.623
Did you really know that boy who
died?

36:33.624 --> 36:35.304
Yeah. He was my friend.

36:37.944 --> 36:39.671
That can't have been nice for you.

36:39.672 --> 36:41.812
Well, my mum's in the police.

36:43.992 --> 36:46.192
She's a detective on the case.

36:47.016 --> 36:47.936
Is she, now?

36:51.480 --> 36:54.740
Come here, Tom.
I want to show you something.

36:56.664 --> 36:58.744
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

37:09.624 --> 37:11.124
Have a look in here.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.090
Do you know what it is?

37:15.528 --> 37:16.678
It was Danny's.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.380
That's right.

37:19.704 --> 37:21.431
I've been looking after it.

37:21.432 --> 37:23.922
But if you were a friend of his...

37:25.320 --> 37:28.860
.. then I think it's only right that
you have it.

37:29.064 --> 37:30.274
Don't you think?

37:48.072 --> 37:49.642
That you, buddy?
Yep.

37:49.944 --> 37:52.374
Dad! Come and look what I've got.

37:52.392 --> 37:56.112
Mate, why aren't you in school?
Hello, you. You OK?

37:57.576 --> 38:00.656
Tom, what's that?
It's Danny's skateboard.

38:01.752 --> 38:04.055
Mate, why have you got Danny's
skateboard?

38:04.056 --> 38:05.796
Tom... Tom, put it down.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.630
Why?
Put it down really gently.

38:09.816 --> 38:12.016
No-one else is gonna touch it.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.735
Tom, tell me the truth.
You won't be in trouble.

38:17.736 --> 38:19.319
Where did you get that from?

38:19.320 --> 38:20.940
Someone gave it to me.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.258
Who gave it to you, sweetheart?

38:41.208 --> 38:43.648
Cover the back. You, come with me.

38:44.376 --> 38:47.746
Susan, it's DI Hardy.
Can you open up, please?

38:49.992 --> 38:51.382
Right, get it open.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.815
Get SOCO here. We have to find her.
She can't be far.

39:07.128 --> 39:09.398
Thank you for popping in, Susan.

39:10.008 --> 39:12.208
I did a little digging on you.

39:12.312 --> 39:14.232
Friends in low places, see.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.940
I know about your husband.

39:21.240 --> 39:25.790
And your children. And what was said
but never proved about you.

39:28.584 --> 39:30.434
What do you want from me?

39:30.744 --> 39:32.024
You threatened me.

39:33.048 --> 39:36.503
And I want you to know that I'm the
one who dobbed you in to the police.

39:36.504 --> 39:39.194
Isn't that right, Detective
Inspector?

39:43.992 --> 39:46.202
Hello, mate. How are you doing?

39:47.448 --> 39:49.178
You know me, don't you?

39:49.896 --> 39:52.446
She leave you here all on your own?

39:53.064 --> 39:55.494
Can't have that, can we? Come on.

39:56.376 --> 39:57.006
Come on.

40:06.456 --> 40:07.616
You are awesome.

40:09.336 --> 40:11.546
I know, petal. Watch and learn.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.975
Where's the dog? Where's my dog?
Where's my dog?

40:17.976 --> 40:20.536
Bloody answer me!
Where is the dog?

40:21.432 --> 40:22.642
Where is my dog?

40:32.376 --> 40:34.406
Dad, what are we doing here?

40:34.968 --> 40:36.298
What do you think?

40:36.984 --> 40:37.564
Right...

40:39.432 --> 40:40.412
Here's yours.

40:41.160 --> 40:41.560
Beth.

40:43.032 --> 40:44.759
Let's see who wins the most, eh?

40:44.760 --> 40:47.639
Who can get the most value out of
the 2p-ers.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.655
Is he being serious?
Are you serious?

40:49.656 --> 40:51.527
Of course I'm being serious. Come on.

40:51.528 --> 40:54.188
See who wins the most. Give it a go.

40:58.296 --> 40:59.986
That one looks annoying.

41:00.312 --> 41:01.895
I think those ones could go.

41:01.896 --> 41:03.296
Yes!
Yeah!

41:03.912 --> 41:05.582
It's mine.
It's mine.

41:37.608 --> 41:40.055
Now, was that good or was that good?

41:40.056 --> 41:41.096
That was good.

41:43.224 --> 41:45.239
We did this all the time when you
were little.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.983
Yeah, when it was pissing it down
with rain. All four of us.

41:48.984 --> 41:52.824
Danny would've spent it all on the
grabbers. And lost.

41:53.736 --> 41:56.183
We'll have to bring the baby when
it's born.

41:56.184 --> 41:58.775
They love all the noises and flashing
lights.

41:58.776 --> 41:59.176
Yeah.

42:00.792 --> 42:02.992
Yeah, we will have to do that.

42:10.584 --> 42:13.734
Why did you have Danny Latimer's
skateboard?

42:16.488 --> 42:20.628
Why did you give Danny Latimer's
skateboard to Tom Miller?

42:22.248 --> 42:24.288
What's your favourite colour?

42:24.984 --> 42:29.264
I can do this all day.
Not by the look of you, you can't.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.490
I want to see my dog.

42:32.184 --> 42:34.404
What, solicitor not good enough?

42:35.352 --> 42:38.663
I ain't saying anything
until I've seen my dog.

42:38.664 --> 42:42.084
I don't think you're in a position to
bargain.

42:43.128 --> 42:43.928
We'll see.

42:44.712 --> 42:47.042
Take some thinking time. No rush.

42:49.752 --> 42:51.612
Find her bastard dog! Now!

43:08.904 --> 43:10.775
What are we gonna do with you, boy,
eh?

43:43.032 --> 43:43.372
Tom?

43:47.496 --> 43:48.886
What are you doing?

43:49.080 --> 43:50.130
Hello?

43:55.128 --> 43:56.999
Sir.
Tell me you found the dog.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.015
No, but...
Find the dog. We need the dog.

43:59.016 --> 44:02.183
Sir, shut up for a second.
Did you tell me to shut up?

44:02.184 --> 44:04.631
There's been a break-in at the
cliff-top hut.

44:04.632 --> 44:08.087
The murder scene? That's sealed off.
A report of torchlight inside.

44:08.088 --> 44:11.298
Don't stand there wittering, Miller.
Come on!

44:31.992 --> 44:32.452
Aargh!

44:33.144 --> 44:34.184
Sir!
Come on!

44:39.336 --> 44:42.676
Suspect heading for boatyard.
West Harbour Lane.

44:45.096 --> 44:45.496
Stop!

44:54.168 --> 44:58.758
We know you're in there. You are
surrounded. You can't get out.

45:01.656 --> 45:02.296
Bollocks!

45:04.536 --> 45:05.166
Oh! Sir!

45:12.744 --> 45:14.264
Sir! What?

45:14.760 --> 45:18.130
Aargh! Sir, what is it? Sir, what's
the matter?

45:20.664 --> 45:22.284
OK, OK. Get after him!

45:23.400 --> 45:25.670
Get after him! Get an ambulance!

45:26.136 --> 45:28.016
Control. Ambulance required.

45:28.296 --> 45:30.023
Senior member of the Force down.

45:30.024 --> 45:31.704
Don't you die.
