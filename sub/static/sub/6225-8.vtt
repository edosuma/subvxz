There must be some way to

According to the Knight's Rules,

-We don't know anything about her.

- I accepted the challenge.

03:30.795 --> 03:33.255

she will prove herself.

I'm just saying you need to be...

04:44.869 --> 04:47.872
Cautious because it sounds like
she's pretty handy with a sword.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.182
Do not let go of the rope.

18:19.307 --> 18:20.433
(GRUNTS)

18:20.517 --> 18:21.685
(ARTHUR YELLING)

18:23.270 --> 18:24.479
(CRASHING)

18:42.706 --> 18:44.082
MERLIN: Which way?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.253
Do you actually know where we're going?

18:48.628 --> 18:49.921
It's this way.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.172
(NEIGHING)

18:52.257 --> 18:53.591
Come on.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.177
What is wrong with this horse?

18:56.261 --> 18:58.054
It's even dumber than you, Merlin.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.601
Where are you going?
| thought you said it was left.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.603
It's not me. It's the horse!

19:07.856 --> 19:09.024
Morgause told me,

19:09.691 --> 19:10.942
"When the time comes,

19:11.234 --> 19:12.736
"you'll know your way."

19:13.528 --> 19:15.780
So the horse knows where we're going.
Great.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.743
GAIUS: Come on, Merlin.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.078
Merlin?

19:39.012 --> 19:41.014
You've been guarding an empty room.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.101
Send out a search party.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.103
Find Arthur and bring
him back to Camelot.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.483
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

19:52.317 --> 19:55.236
Do you have any idea
what Morgause might want with Arthur?

19:55.945 --> 19:57.405
I'm afraid I don't.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.911
What if Morgause challenges you
to do something you don't want to do?

20:02.994 --> 20:04.621
I'm not expecting it to be easy, Merlin.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.914
That's why it's called a challenge.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.124
So you'd do anything she asks of you?

20:08.792 --> 20:11.378
| gave her my word.
It's a question of honor.

20:11.461 --> 20:12.879
What if she challenges you

20:12.962 --> 20:15.298
to do something even less honorable
than breaking your word?

20:15.465 --> 20:17.967
Will you stop rabbiting on?

20:19.886 --> 20:22.430
We're in Odin's territory.
We could be attacked at any second.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.808
| just think it's strange to agree
to do something

20:24.891 --> 20:25.892
when you don't know what it is.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.894
One more word out of you, Merlin,

20:27.977 --> 20:29.396
and you'll be taking
the challenge in my place.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.523
(NEIGHING)

20:40.115 --> 20:41.491
(GRUNTING)

20:43.827 --> 20:45.203
(GROANING)

20:51.084 --> 20:52.502

(CHANTING)

21:04.222 --> 21:05.348
(SHOUTING)

21:15.233 --> 21:16.317
Don't worry, Merlin.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.485
I'll deal with this.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.946
You lie there,
make yourself comfortable.

21:21.489 --> 21:22.574
(SIGHS)

21:25.535 --> 21:27.412
Maybe we should turn back.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.247
The woods could be full of Odin's men.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.207
You can go back if you want to.
| won't stop you.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.918
You don't know anything about Morgause!

21:34.002 --> 21:35.962
You don't know what she's
going to ask you to do!

21:36.045 --> 21:38.923
We don't even know where we're going.
We're following a horse.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.259
Morgause said she knew my mother.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.020
Gaius. Come in.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.064
Hello, my dear.
I've brought you your sleeping draft.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.525
| could've saved you the trouble.

21:58.109 --> 22:00.487
I've had the best night's sleep
| can remember.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.031
No nightmares?

22:03.114 --> 22:04.449
| can't tell you what a relief it is.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.494
| only wish I could
thank Morgause for her gift.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.996
Morgause gave you that bracelet?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.081
She told me it would help me sleep.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.458
She spoke the truth.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.336
Gaius, what is it?

22:16.753 --> 22:17.879
Nothing.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.841
| am merely surprised
that it's so effective.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.761
| feel as if I somehow know Morgause.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.305
| don't see how,

22:27.680 --> 22:29.766
but I am pleased you're feeling better.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.528
What was your mother like?

22:42.987 --> 22:44.405
ARTHUR: I never knew her.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.492
She died before I opened my eyes.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.743
I'm sorry.

22:50.078 --> 22:51.871
| barely know anything about her.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.040
Can't you ask your father?

22:57.126 --> 22:58.545
He refuses to talk of her.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.797
It must be too painful for him.

23:01.464 --> 23:03.841
Sometimes it's as if
she never even existed.

23:05.677 --> 23:08.596
| still have a sense of her,

23:09.806 --> 23:11.724
almost as though she's part of me.

23:14.102 --> 23:17.313
That's the same with my father.
| never knew him.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.110
And my mother has barely spoken of him.

23:23.278 --> 23:26.155
I've got this vague memory.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.534
It's probably just my imagination.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.665
I'd do anything for
even the vaguest memory.

23:38.334 --> 23:41.087
Is that why you're so determined
to find Morgause?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.755
To see what she knows about your mother?

23:42.839 --> 23:43.923
Is that so wrong?

23:44.007 --> 23:45.091
No.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.140
We should get some rest.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.857
My Lord, I must speak with you.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.067
It concerns Morgause.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.153
What is it?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.614
While I was treating her wound,
| noticed...

24:08.239 --> 24:09.949
That she wore a bracelet.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.951
Go on.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.663
It bore the mark of one of the Great
Houses, the Great House of Gorlois.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.499
There's only one person

24:18.583 --> 24:22.170
other than Morgana, who would have cause
to wear such a bracelet.

24:24.172 --> 24:26.215
That is her half-sister.

24:27.175 --> 24:30.053
| was lead to believe
that the child had died.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.518
The child lived, my Lord.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.273
She was smuggled out of Camelot
after her birth.

24:42.607 --> 24:43.941
How do you know this?

24:46.903 --> 24:51.449
It was I who entrusted the child to the
high priestesses of the old religion.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.870
You should've told me, Gaius.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.290
| had sworn a solemn oath, my Lord.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.751
I'm only breaking it now,

25:02.710 --> 25:04.754
because I fear what Morgause might do.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.298
Does Morgana know?

25:08.466 --> 25:09.717
| don't believe so.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.970
Morgana must never find out
she has a half-sister.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.974
| will not have her loyalties divided.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.811
Of course.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.814
The high priestesses will have trained,

25:22.897 --> 25:24.273
Morgause from birth.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.776
Her magic will be powerful.

25:26.901 --> 25:30.988
Then we must hope the search party
finds Arthur before he reaches her.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.997
Seems your horse
has brought us to a dead end.

25:43.084 --> 25:44.544
Now where's he going?

25:45.294 --> 25:47.088
| think you're going to get wet.

25:47.338 --> 25:48.881
ARTHUR: You don't say.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.643
Arthur?

26:30.381 --> 26:31.758
MERLIN: Where are we?

26:32.133 --> 26:33.426
| don't know.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.682
If we weren't sure
Morgause was a sorcerer before,

26:39.766 --> 26:41.100
we can be certain of it now.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.312
That must've been how she defeated me.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.688
She was using magic.

26:46.606 --> 26:47.899
MERLIN: Hmm.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.109
It didn't look like she was.

26:51.569 --> 26:53.905
And what would you know
about magic, Merlin?

26:56.157 --> 26:57.492
Nothing.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.142
Now what?

27:23.226 --> 27:24.852
Maybe we should ask the horse.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.360
There's no one here.

27:32.777 --> 27:34.487
MORGAUSE: You kept your promise.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.707
What's the nature of the challenge
you wish to set me?

27:47.083 --> 27:48.543
Place your head on the block.

27:54.799 --> 27:56.968
You gave me your word
that you'd do anything I asked.

27:57.677 --> 27:58.886
Arthur, don't.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.562
What're you doing?

28:09.188 --> 28:10.314
| won't let you do this!

28:10.398 --> 28:11.816
Stay out of this, Merlin.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.449
(GASPING)

28:40.177 --> 28:43.681
You've shown that you are truly
a man of your word, Arthur Pendragon.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.476
And for that, I will grant you one wish.

28:49.312 --> 28:51.522
Tell me what it is that
your heart most desires.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.317
You said you knew my mother.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.777
Tell me all that you know about her.

28:56.861 --> 28:58.613
Perhaps you would like to see her.

29:01.032 --> 29:02.783
| want that more than anything.

29:03.618 --> 29:04.785
As you wish.

29:14.003 --> 29:16.380
The search party
were unable to pick up a trail.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.383
There's no sign of
Prince Arthur anywhere.

29:19.759 --> 29:23.429
Re-double your efforts.
Send riders to the outlying villages.

29:23.512 --> 29:24.972
| want my son found!

29:25.056 --> 29:26.057
(CLATTERING)

29:26.223 --> 29:27.558
Yes, my Lord.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.314
It chills me to think
what Morgause has planned for Arthur.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.608
Had she chosen to,
she already could've killed him.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.736
| believe she has some
other purpose in mind.

29:39.737 --> 29:43.115
Morgause told Arthur
that she knew his mother.

29:44.575 --> 29:45.660
She knew Ygraine?

29:45.743 --> 29:46.994
| don't know!

29:48.871 --> 29:50.206
Perhaps it's a lie.

29:50.831 --> 29:53.334
She knew that it would
tempt Arthur to go to her.

29:54.126 --> 29:58.089
You think that Morgause knows the
true circumstances of Arthur's birth?

30:00.007 --> 30:01.884
| fear that more than anything.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.311
Are you sure you want to do this?

30:12.937 --> 30:14.355
If you were granted
the same opportunity,

30:14.438 --> 30:15.773
would you not want to meet your father?

30:19.485 --> 30:22.655
Uther won't forgive you if he finds out
you've collaborated with a sorcerer.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.241
What if my father's attitude
to magic is wrong?

30:26.784 --> 30:28.202
You really think that?

30:28.786 --> 30:30.663
Perhaps it's not as simple
as he would have us believe.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.833
Morgause is a sorceress,
she has caused us no harm.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.085
Surely not everyone,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.212
who practices magic can be evil?

30:40.423 --> 30:42.383
We don't actually know
why she's doing this.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.012
It is time.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.524
Close your eyes.

31:06.323 --> 31:07.575
(CHANTING)

31:35.061 --> 31:36.312
YGRAINE: Arthur.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.481
(GASPS)

31:38.939 --> 31:40.149
Arthur.

31:40.900 --> 31:41.984
Mother.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.235
My son.

31:47.615 --> 31:50.367
When I last held you,
you were a tiny baby.

31:51.786 --> 31:53.412
| remember your eyes.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.831
You were staring up at me.

31:56.123 --> 31:59.251
Those few seconds I held you
were the most precious of my life.

32:01.587 --> 32:02.713
I'm so sorry.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.882
You have nothing to be sorry for.

32:05.508 --> 32:06.801
It was my birth that caused you to die.

32:06.884 --> 32:08.302
No, you are not to blame.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.638
| cannot bear that thought
that you died because of me.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.139
Do not think that.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.810
It is your father who should
carry the guilt for what happened.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.062
What do you mean?

32:18.604 --> 32:21.440
It is not important.
What matters is that you lived.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.818
Why should my father feel guilty?

32:24.235 --> 32:26.195
YGRAINE: It is better left in the past.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.489
You cannot leave me with more questions.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.533
Please.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.704
Your father.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.667
He was desperate for an heir.

32:40.334 --> 32:43.629
Without a son, the Pendragon dynasty
would come to an end.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.508
But I could not conceive.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.052
Then how was I born?

32:52.972 --> 32:54.098
Tell me.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.019
Your father betrayed me.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.648
He went to the sorceress, Nimueh,

33:02.731 --> 33:05.109
and asked for her help in conceiving
a child.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.488
You were born of magic.

33:13.534 --> 33:14.743
That's not true.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.370
I'm sorry, Arthur.

33:16.954 --> 33:18.497
Your father has deceived you,

33:18.581 --> 33:19.874
as he deceived me.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.501
To create a life, a life must be taken.

33:22.585 --> 33:23.878
Your father knew that.

33:24.712 --> 33:25.838
No.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.673
He sacrificed my life,

33:27.756 --> 33:30.551
so the Pendragon dynasty could continue.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.928
It makes you no less my son,

33:33.012 --> 33:35.222
nor me any less proud of you.

33:35.931 --> 33:39.268
Now I see you,
| would have given my life willingly.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.440
Do not let this knowledge change you.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.238
(WIND WHOOSHING)

33:57.536 --> 33:58.704
No!

33:59.288 --> 34:00.497
Bring her back!

34:00.748 --> 34:01.832
| cannot.

34:01.916 --> 34:03.125
Once the doorway is closed,

34:03.209 --> 34:04.668
it is closed forever.

34:07.338 --> 34:11.175
| am truly sorry that you learned of
your mother's fate in this way.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.886
| can only imagine how it must feel

34:13.969 --> 34:16.804
to discover your father
is responsible for her death.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.560
It is an unforgivable betrayal.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.735
Are you all right?

34:33.072 --> 34:34.156
Arthur?

34:35.824 --> 34:37.201
Fetch the horses.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.744
We're returning to Camelot.

35:00.641 --> 35:01.976
What are you going to do?

35:05.437 --> 35:06.522
Merlin.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.940
I'm relieved to see you're safe.

35:08.023 --> 35:09.316
Where's Arthur?

35:18.659 --> 35:19.952
Arthur was born of magic.

35:22.538 --> 35:23.706
Wasn't he?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.418
Uther used magic.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.044
Merlin.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.297
All those people he's executed.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.173
He's as guilty as they are.

35:33.257 --> 35:34.967
He sacrificed Arthur's mother.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.927
He as good as murdered her.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.601
People should know
the truth about what he's done.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.772
How could you not tell me?

35:50.649 --> 35:53.485
| feared what Arthur would do
if he ever found out.

35:54.653 --> 35:55.946
He's found out now.

36:03.871 --> 36:05.039
Arthur.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.041
Where have you been?

36:07.166 --> 36:09.585
| have had search
parties out looking for you.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.463
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

36:13.630 --> 36:14.923
Arthur?

36:15.507 --> 36:19.345
| know what you did to my mother.

36:20.888 --> 36:22.222
Leave us.

36:23.265 --> 36:24.558
No one is to enter.

36:28.604 --> 36:29.730
What're you talking about?

36:29.813 --> 36:32.107
You were so desperate for an heir,

36:32.691 --> 36:34.109
you were prepared to use magic.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.278
Did Morgause tell you this? She's lying.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.821
My mother is dead,

36:38.405 --> 36:41.158
because of your selfishness
and arrogance.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.077
Her blood is on your hands.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.536
No, that's not true.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.080
But Morgause would
have you believe that.

36:46.163 --> 36:49.750
This is what fuels your hatred
for those who practice magic.

36:49.833 --> 36:53.962
Rather than blame yourself for
what you did, you blame them.

36:54.046 --> 36:57.174
You would believe a sorcerer's lies
over the word of your own father?

36:57.758 --> 36:59.676
| can only think that
Morgause has enchanted you.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.888
You've hunted her kind like animals.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.183
How many hundreds have you
condemned to death to ease your guilt?

37:06.725 --> 37:10.771
Those who practice magic
will stop at nothing to destroy us.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.857
| have only done what is necessary
to protect this kingdom.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.402
You speak of honor and nobility!

37:16.485 --> 37:18.153
You're nothing but a hypocrite,

37:18.237 --> 37:19.488
(SHOUTS) and a liar.

37:19.571 --> 37:23.784
| am your king and your father
and you will show me some respect!

37:39.633 --> 37:41.176
Have you lost your mind?

37:42.428 --> 37:43.846
Pick it up.

37:44.471 --> 37:46.682
Arthur, I implore you.
Think about what you're doing.

37:46.807 --> 37:49.435
Pick it up.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.019
| will not fight you.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.195
If you choose not to defend yourself,

38:02.030 --> 38:04.324
| will strike you down where you stand.

38:05.701 --> 38:07.286
You're my son.

38:08.203 --> 38:10.038
You will not strike an unarmed man.

38:10.205 --> 38:13.959
| no longer think of myself as your son.

38:16.003 --> 38:17.629
Then strike me down.

38:30.392 --> 38:31.977
| don't want to fight you.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.656
(GRUNTING)

38:46.241 --> 38:47.993
Arthur, stop this.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.007
(PANTING)

39:21.777 --> 39:22.945
(GRUNTING)

39:23.028 --> 39:24.530
The King has forbidden anyone to enter.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.281
They're going to kill each other!

39:35.624 --> 39:37.125
Arthur! Don't!

39:37.376 --> 39:38.627
| know you don't want to do this.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.629
My mother is dead because of him.

39:40.796 --> 39:42.589
Killing your father
won't bring her back.

39:43.423 --> 39:46.635
You've lost one parent,
do you really want to lose another?

39:47.219 --> 39:48.387
Listen to him, Arthur.

39:48.971 --> 39:50.305
Arthur, please.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.392
Put the sword down.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.644
You heard what my mother said.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.146
After everything he has done,

39:58.272 --> 40:00.148
do you believe he deserves to live?

40:00.732 --> 40:04.278
He executes those who use magic,
and yet he has used it himself.

40:04.736 --> 40:08.240
You have caused
so much suffering and pain.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.992
| will put an end to that.

40:10.993 --> 40:13.120
Morgause is lying.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.001
She's an enchantress.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.837
She tricked you.

40:22.254 --> 40:24.339
That was not your mother you saw.
That was an illusion.

40:27.175 --> 40:28.635
Everything,

40:29.761 --> 40:31.972
everything your mother said to you,

40:33.140 --> 40:34.683
those were Morgause's words.

40:34.808 --> 40:35.851
You don't know that...

40:35.976 --> 40:37.853
This has been her plan all along,

40:38.478 --> 40:40.272
to turn you against your father.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.107
And if you Kill him,

40:42.524 --> 40:44.026
the kingdom will be destroyed.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.527
This is what she wants.

40:48.155 --> 40:50.282
Listen to him. He's speaking the truth.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.994
Swear to me that it isn't true.

40:54.536 --> 40:56.538
You are not responsible
for my mother's death.

40:56.663 --> 40:57.831
Give me your word!

40:59.333 --> 41:01.501
| swear on my life. I loved your mother.

41:02.002 --> 41:04.880
There isn't a day passes that
| don't wish that she was still alive.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.216
| could never have
done anything to hurt her.

41:22.564 --> 41:23.899
(PANTING)

41:26.902 --> 41:28.070
My son.

41:28.320 --> 41:30.572
You mean more to me than anything.

41:32.908 --> 41:34.368
(SOBBING) I'm sorry.

41:35.494 --> 41:36.870
You are not to blame.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.585
(ARTHUR SOBBING)

41:59.142 --> 42:00.602
I'm indebted to you, Merlin.

42:01.603 --> 42:04.439
| had become confused.

42:06.066 --> 42:08.985
It is once again clear to me
that those who practice magic

42:09.111 --> 42:10.987
are evil and dangerous.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.825
And that is thanks to you.

42:17.327 --> 42:18.662
Glad I could help.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.425
My Lord.

42:32.134 --> 42:36.638
| wanted to thank you in person
for your actions yesterday.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.433
You are a loyal servant to Arthur.

42:39.766 --> 42:41.017
| am most grateful.

42:41.143 --> 42:42.602
| was just doing my duty.

42:42.686 --> 42:45.272
You've proven yourself
to be a trusted ally,

42:45.355 --> 42:46.940
in the fight against magic.

42:49.484 --> 42:50.652
Me?

42:50.861 --> 42:52.320
Those who practice magic,

42:52.988 --> 42:56.533
will seek to exploit
Arthur's inexperience.

42:57.617 --> 42:59.369
They will attempt to corrupt him.

43:00.954 --> 43:02.497
You must be extra vigilant.

43:02.956 --> 43:04.332
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.168
| know you will.

43:07.794 --> 43:09.004
If you ever speak

43:09.129 --> 43:12.132
of what happened
between myself and Arthur

43:12.215 --> 43:14.676
to another living soul,
| will have you hanged.

43:16.845 --> 43:18.013
Right. Of course.

43:18.680 --> 43:19.848
Yes, my Lord.

43:28.648 --> 43:30.525
Is that Uther I saw just leaving?

43:30.650 --> 43:31.735
Yeah.

43:32.194 --> 43:33.403
He just popped in to say "Hello".

43:33.528 --> 43:35.530
Merlin, what did he want?

43:35.989 --> 43:38.200
He wanted to thank me
for being a trusted ally

43:38.325 --> 43:40.160
in the fight against magic.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.043
How you've managed to keep
that head on your shoulders

43:48.168 --> 43:50.879
IS a mystery beyond our greatest minds.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.507
Uther should be grateful.

43:54.174 --> 43:57.177
Your life would've been easier
and safer if you had let him die.

44:01.389 --> 44:02.933
You must have been tempted.

44:04.226 --> 44:05.435
Maybe for a moment,

44:06.228 --> 44:07.646
but Arthur wouldn't have
been able to forgive himself

44:07.729 --> 44:08.730
if he'd gone through with it...

44:10.065 --> 44:11.441
It would've destroyed him.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.195
I'm proud of you, Merlin.

44:19.950 --> 44:22.828
Arthur's thanking me,
Uther's grateful, you're proud.

44:22.911 --> 44:24.079
I've never been this popular.

44:25.580 --> 44:26.873
I'm almost certain it won't last.

44:28.250 --> 44:32.587
Just let me enjoy the moment.

44:33.129 --> 44:34.548
(LAUGHING)

44:36.883 --> 44:38.927
(MORGAUSE CHANTING)

44:54.150 --> 44:55.443
DRAGON: Merlin.

44:56.987 --> 44:59.281
GAIUS: She's fallen prey
to a bounty hunter.

45:01.783 --> 45:03.493
Do you know how much money
she's worth to me?

45:04.160 --> 45:05.287
Why did you do that?

45:05.412 --> 45:06.663
-What?
-Help me.

45:06.913 --> 45:09.416
I've never known anyone like you.

45:12.127 --> 45:13.295
The girl is dangerous.

45:13.420 --> 45:15.797
An informer told me she was cursed.

45:16.089 --> 45:17.340
-Freyal
-No!
