00:04.255 --> 00:05.572
Ooh, Chicago!

00:05.574 --> 00:07.291
There is this pizza place
called Gazzola's.

00:07.293 --> 00:08.525
It's fantastic.

00:08.527 --> 00:10.693
It was closed down for a while,
but it just reopened.

00:10.696 --> 00:12.663
I'm sure they got
a Godzilla's in New York.

00:12.665 --> 00:13.997
We're not stopping.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.717
It's just pizza.

00:16.719 --> 00:18.669
Just... pizza?

00:19.487 --> 00:21.255
Let me tell you

00:21.257 --> 00:25.325
about the thing
you say is just pizza.

00:25.327 --> 00:27.377
We begin with the first bite.

00:27.379 --> 00:29.413
Oh, the crunch!

00:29.415 --> 00:30.714
And then the marinara.

00:30.716 --> 00:33.467
That roiling lava

00:33.469 --> 00:37.020
of tomato and oregano--
it overtakes you!

00:37.022 --> 00:40.006
I'm falling!

00:40.008 --> 00:43.243
And that's....
when she catches you.

00:43.245 --> 00:44.578
That chewy,

00:44.580 --> 00:48.699
voluptuous mistress, Mozzarella.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.987
Her oven-kissed cheeks crackle
with warmth in your mouth,

00:53.989 --> 00:55.873
cradling the sauce
and the bread,

00:55.875 --> 00:58.325
letting you know
that from now on...

00:58.327 --> 01:02.129
this... is home.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.165
This pizza...

01:05.167 --> 01:07.334
is home.

01:09.003 --> 01:11.088
If it was so delicious,

01:11.090 --> 01:13.590
why'd they close it
in the first place?

01:13.592 --> 01:15.125
Rats.
We're not stopping!

01:15.127 --> 01:17.177
This road trip sucks!

<i>Tim Gunn, out.</i>

<i>Lily, busted.</i>

<i>Marshpillow,</i>

01:40.920 --> 01:43.503
<i>We were playing what we thought</i>
<i>was our final hand,</i>

01:43.505 --> 01:45.639
<i>and it was getting intense.</i>

01:45.641 --> 01:47.958
Action to Ranjit.

01:50.929 --> 01:52.613
Ranjit, action to you.

01:52.615 --> 01:54.681
What?!

01:54.683 --> 01:56.249
Hey, Ted, thanks
again for your gift.

01:56.251 --> 01:59.386
He gave us a framed photo
of all of us at the bar, and

01:59.388 --> 02:01.722
he's getting us
two other wedding gifts.

02:01.724 --> 02:03.890
What can I say? I just love
giving wedding gifts.

02:03.892 --> 02:05.309
I love giving
wedding gifts so much,

02:05.311 --> 02:08.027
I wish I could marry
giving-wedding-gifts,

02:08.030 --> 02:10.864
and then get myself
and giving-wedding-gifts

02:10.866 --> 02:13.183
a wedding gift.

02:13.185 --> 02:15.619
Maybe saying things like that's
why I am not married.

02:17.206 --> 02:19.706
<i>Kids, there's a story</i>
<i>behind that face.</i>

02:19.708 --> 02:22.125
<i>Six years earlier, a few weeks</i>
<i>after their wedding,</i>

02:22.127 --> 02:24.711
<i>Marshall and Lily were going</i>
<i>through their wedding gifts.</i>

02:24.713 --> 02:26.330
Well, that's weird.

02:26.332 --> 02:27.998
Did Ted get us anything?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.267
Come on, Lily.

02:30.269 --> 02:31.802
Ted... Ted's our
best friend.

02:31.804 --> 02:34.788
If his gift hasn't arrived
yet, it's on the way.

02:34.790 --> 02:37.424
<i>But time passed,</i>
<i>and no gift arrived.</i>

02:37.426 --> 02:39.192
<i>Finally, Marshall started</i>
<i>dropping hints.</i>

02:39.194 --> 02:40.494
Hey, man,

02:40.496 --> 02:41.979
it was great having you
at our wedding.

02:41.981 --> 02:44.014
Thanks, Bro,
and thanks for this coffee.

02:44.016 --> 02:45.565
It is great.

02:45.567 --> 02:48.335
You were not wedding absent.

02:48.337 --> 02:50.354
No, sir.

02:50.356 --> 02:53.006
You were wedding <i>present.</i>

02:53.008 --> 02:55.709
Do I detect a note
of hazelnut?

02:57.396 --> 02:59.713
Wedding present.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.034
I think he got it.

03:05.169 --> 03:06.837
<i>But I didn't get it.</i>

03:06.839 --> 03:08.405
<i>More months passed.</i>

03:08.407 --> 03:10.173
<i>His hints got more desperate.</i>

03:10.175 --> 03:11.541
Happy Halloween!

03:11.543 --> 03:13.593
Yeah. What-what are
you supposed to be?

03:13.595 --> 03:15.595
Well, I'm a wedding present,
Ted!

03:15.597 --> 03:18.181
How could you not get me
a wedding present?

03:18.183 --> 03:22.102
I mean, how could you not get
that I am a wedding present?

03:22.720 --> 03:25.305
Get me? A wedding present!

03:25.307 --> 03:28.675
Get me a wedding present.

03:28.677 --> 03:29.943
Why isn't he getting it?!

03:29.945 --> 03:31.111
I don't know.

03:31.113 --> 03:32.496
Why didn't you
get the message

03:32.498 --> 03:35.065
to dress up like a pregnant
teenager, home skillet?

03:35.067 --> 03:38.068
<i>But he kept on waiting</i>
<i>until the summer of 2008</i>

03:38.070 --> 03:39.503
<i>when I got engaged.</i>

03:39.505 --> 03:41.371
So Ted's getting married, huh?

03:41.373 --> 03:43.707
Bet he'd love a gift
from his old pal Marshall.

03:43.709 --> 03:44.991
Well, he can forget it!

03:44.993 --> 03:46.910
We're getting them a gift.

03:46.912 --> 03:48.178
But Lily, this is the dream.

03:48.180 --> 03:50.480
This is the whole reason
we wanted Ted to <i>get</i> married.

03:50.482 --> 03:52.282
So we could not
give him a wedding gift,

03:52.284 --> 03:53.950
and he would know
exactly how it feels!

03:53.952 --> 03:57.020
Baby, I'm as pissed as you are,
but we're getting them a gift.

03:57.022 --> 03:58.422
We have to.

04:00.258 --> 04:02.426
Fine.

04:02.428 --> 04:05.228
We'll get them a gift.

04:05.230 --> 04:08.265
A gift that'll send
a message loud and clear.

04:08.267 --> 04:11.168
A gift-wrapping
station!

04:11.170 --> 04:13.820
Oh, boy. This time,

04:13.822 --> 04:15.939
he <i>has</i> to get it.

04:15.941 --> 04:18.442
<i>And not long after</i>
<i>that, a package arrived.</i>

04:18.444 --> 04:20.660
Oh, well, well, well.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.580
Package from one
Mr. Ted Mosby.

04:23.582 --> 04:25.499
It's a little late, but...

04:25.501 --> 04:27.751
What the balls is this?!

04:27.753 --> 04:29.753
It-It's a thank you note

04:29.755 --> 04:32.923
for the gift-wrapping station.

04:32.925 --> 04:35.408
<i>Which explains the face.</i>

04:35.410 --> 04:36.943
Wedding gift.

04:36.945 --> 04:38.411
Hey, Barney.

04:38.413 --> 04:39.980
I've got a wedding gift
for you, too.

04:39.982 --> 04:41.247
Don't get married.

04:41.249 --> 04:42.415
Ah.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.634
In fact, it comes
in His and Hers.

04:44.636 --> 04:46.019
Don't get married!

04:46.021 --> 04:47.304
Don't get married!

04:47.306 --> 04:48.638
Ah.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.758
I'm not cheating!
Don't tell anyone!

04:51.760 --> 04:53.226
I'll cut you in on half!

04:53.228 --> 04:54.795
Hey, Barney,

04:54.797 --> 04:58.448
can you ask James to stop
crapping all over marriage?

04:58.450 --> 05:00.300
He's not crapping on marriage.

05:00.302 --> 05:02.486
He literally drew this
on the toilet.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.523
Come on, Robin. Please
don't ask me to pick sides.

05:06.525 --> 05:08.959
In two days,
he's gonna be your brother, too.

05:08.961 --> 05:11.411
Just be honest and tell him
what's bothering you.

05:11.413 --> 05:13.697
Okay.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.216
Marshall, are you...?

05:16.218 --> 05:17.517
Hey, Andretti!

05:17.519 --> 05:19.503
Beat it!

05:19.505 --> 05:22.906
Marshall, are you sitting down?

05:22.908 --> 05:24.123
Well, I'm in a car,

05:24.125 --> 05:25.642
and you were pretty clear about

05:25.644 --> 05:27.177
the No-Teen-Wolfing
Now-That-I'm-A-Dad rule,

05:27.179 --> 05:29.062
so, yeah, I'm sitting down.

05:29.064 --> 05:32.933
Ted is getting Barney and Robin
three wedding gifts!

05:34.018 --> 05:36.019
I hate him.

05:36.021 --> 05:37.020
Lily,

05:37.022 --> 05:38.605
requesting permission
to make a stink?

05:38.607 --> 05:40.490
Stink away!

05:40.492 --> 05:44.110
Hurry up and get it over with.

05:45.863 --> 05:47.330
Oh, that's Marshall.

05:47.332 --> 05:48.582
I should take this.

05:48.584 --> 05:49.783
Well,

05:49.785 --> 05:52.936
call me Akira Yoshizawa.

05:54.539 --> 05:56.289
World's most famous origamist?

05:57.975 --> 06:00.260
I fold.

06:01.446 --> 06:04.614
Barney, here's a good one.

06:04.616 --> 06:05.549
What's the difference

06:05.551 --> 06:06.716
between a Journey song

06:06.718 --> 06:08.201
and a husband?

06:09.103 --> 06:11.388
A Journey song has a climax.

06:12.608 --> 06:13.907
I'm sorry, Robin.

06:13.909 --> 06:15.892
I'm just messing with you.

06:15.894 --> 06:17.176
Raise a hundred.

06:17.178 --> 06:19.112
No, it's fine.

06:19.114 --> 06:21.982
It's just funny hearing all
this anti-marriage stuff

06:21.984 --> 06:24.367
from a divorced guy who
still wears his wedding ring.

06:24.369 --> 06:26.286
What, this?
Mm.

06:26.288 --> 06:27.571
Only wear it because,

06:27.573 --> 06:30.407
nothing attracts a gay guy
faster than a wedding ring.

06:30.409 --> 06:31.992
Except saying hi to him.

06:31.994 --> 06:35.545
Or being in the same room,
or every app on my phone.

06:35.547 --> 06:38.548
People, it is a good time
to be gay.

06:38.550 --> 06:41.334
So you can just... you can take
that ring off anytime you want?

06:41.336 --> 06:42.619
Anytime.

06:42.621 --> 06:46.890
I'm all in.

06:46.892 --> 06:48.875
And raise you...

06:48.877 --> 06:51.094
one ring.

06:51.096 --> 06:53.430
Ooh!

06:55.650 --> 06:57.817
Fine.

06:57.819 --> 07:00.053
It's just a ring.

07:00.055 --> 07:03.189
Okay, let's see
what you got.

07:03.191 --> 07:05.942
Robin has three jacks, James

07:05.944 --> 07:07.077
has...

07:07.079 --> 07:09.946
just shy of a pair
of a sixes.

07:09.948 --> 07:12.198
Thank you.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.166
Yeah.

07:13.168 --> 07:14.567
I'm gonna hit the gym.

07:14.569 --> 07:16.036
Let me know if you want
to get some dinner later.

07:16.038 --> 07:19.238
Oh, we'll give you a ring,
just not this one. Ho!

07:22.743 --> 07:24.144
You, Ted Mosby,

07:24.146 --> 07:26.379
never got me
and Lily a wedding gift!

07:26.381 --> 07:27.681
J'accuse!

07:27.683 --> 07:29.466
I did, too, get you a gift!

07:29.468 --> 07:31.184
It was a coffeemaker,

07:31.186 --> 07:33.603
and you never sent me
a thank you note!

07:33.605 --> 07:35.588
Oh.

07:35.590 --> 07:38.275
So-so... <i>me-cuse?</i>

07:38.277 --> 07:40.677
You-cuse!

07:40.679 --> 07:43.280
Robin, when I said, "Be honest
and say what's bothering you,"

07:43.282 --> 07:45.365
I meant, stuff it down
and never do anything about it.

07:45.367 --> 07:46.583
How did you not get that?

07:46.585 --> 07:48.818
It's fine.
He's a grown-up.

07:50.238 --> 07:53.657
What did you do
to my little boy?

07:54.943 --> 07:56.826
Hi, Mom.

07:59.210 --> 08:02.132
You get your brother's ring back!
Mom, please don't make me

08:02.133 --> 08:04.288
take sides!
That's your brother out there.

08:04.289 --> 08:06.372
You two shared bunk
beds and baseball mitts,

08:06.374 --> 08:09.308
and, when you were hungry,
these supple breasts.

08:09.310 --> 08:11.210
Arguably a little too long.

08:11.212 --> 08:12.979
Stinsons stand up
for each other.

08:12.981 --> 08:14.213
Take care of this!

08:14.215 --> 08:16.132
I...
I'm gonna play some cards.

08:16.134 --> 08:18.935
All right, chumps.

08:18.937 --> 08:21.554
I'm gonna tell you what I
told Frampton's guitar tech

08:21.556 --> 08:24.774
when he couldn't find
a condom: let's gamble.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.277
You gave us a coffeemaker?

08:28.279 --> 08:30.263
Not just <i>ah</i> coffeemaker.

08:30.265 --> 08:33.065
I asked what they used
at your favorite coffeehouse

08:33.067 --> 08:35.952
and got you that exact...
one tier down model.

08:35.953 --> 08:39.388
And you know
what you got me? Huh?

08:39.390 --> 08:41.207
<i>No thank you note.</i>

08:41.208 --> 08:43.259
<i>So I started dropping hints</i>
<i>about it.</i>

08:43.260 --> 08:45.494
Do I detect a note of hazelnut?

08:45.496 --> 08:46.662
Wedding present.

08:46.664 --> 08:48.681
Kind of want to say thank you

08:48.683 --> 08:51.217
to that note of hazelnut.

08:51.219 --> 08:53.252
Thank you... note.

08:54.656 --> 08:57.023
Wedding... present.

08:57.025 --> 09:00.042
Anyway...

09:00.044 --> 09:02.161
Thank you note.

09:04.014 --> 09:06.732
Yeah, he got it.

09:06.734 --> 09:08.651
But you never got it!

09:08.653 --> 09:10.603
I drank so much coffee
that year,

09:10.605 --> 09:11.904
hoping you'd take the hint,

09:11.906 --> 09:14.690
my resting pulse was like
the drum solo from "Wipeout."

09:14.692 --> 09:17.410
And then, uh,
Halloween rolled around.

09:17.412 --> 09:18.611
Get me a wedding present.

09:18.613 --> 09:20.830
On that note...

09:20.832 --> 09:22.331
I think you'll like my costume.

09:22.333 --> 09:23.649
Mm.

09:23.651 --> 09:26.985
I'm a thank you note.

09:26.987 --> 09:28.487
Thank you note.
Ah.

09:28.489 --> 09:31.540
Guess you could say
that we sort of go together.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.259
That's right, Marshall.
That's right.

09:33.261 --> 09:35.294
When someone gets you a gift,

09:35.296 --> 09:38.097
you give them
a thank you note.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.215
That is how it works.

09:39.217 --> 09:41.367
Give a gift, get a note.

09:41.369 --> 09:42.752
Agreed.
Exactly.

09:42.754 --> 09:43.819
Exactly.

09:43.821 --> 09:46.856
Exactly.
Exactly.

09:49.359 --> 09:51.644
I think he got it.

09:51.646 --> 09:54.063
Yeah. Yeah, he got it.

09:54.065 --> 09:56.282
I have to find a bathroom.

09:57.701 --> 09:58.784
I didn't get it!

09:58.786 --> 10:00.403
And I thought for sure
you'd get it

10:00.405 --> 10:03.105
when I sent that thank you note
for the wrapping station.

10:03.107 --> 10:06.826
<i>"Dear Marshall and Lily,</i>

10:06.828 --> 10:09.628
<i>"this is a thank you note</i>
<i>to thank you</i>

10:09.630 --> 10:12.248
<i>"for the gift-wrapping station.</i>

10:12.250 --> 10:15.167
<i>"Because even though</i>
<i>the wedding never happened,</i>

10:15.169 --> 10:18.921
<i>"there's one thing that</i>
<i>didn't leave me at the altar,</i>

10:18.923 --> 10:21.757
<i>and that's my manners."</i>

10:21.759 --> 10:23.092
I can't believe this.

10:23.094 --> 10:24.643
Eriksens send thank you notes.

10:24.645 --> 10:26.679
It's the one thing
that we always do!

10:26.681 --> 10:28.681
We even have
a family saying about it.

10:28.683 --> 10:30.566
"Lick it, before you stick it!"

10:30.568 --> 10:33.319
"It" being the stamp
on the thank you note,

10:33.321 --> 10:35.521
before you stick it
in the mailbox.

10:35.523 --> 10:37.222
I will make this right!

10:37.224 --> 10:38.691
I know, right?

10:38.693 --> 10:40.609
Hey, listen, we're about
to go through a tunnel.

10:40.611 --> 10:41.894
Guys, big dilemma.

10:41.896 --> 10:44.229
My mom's insisting
that I get Robin

10:44.231 --> 10:47.733
to give James his ring back,
but Robin's refusing.

10:47.735 --> 10:50.503
But James seems like
he's really upset.

10:50.505 --> 10:52.588
But Robin's
gonna be my wife.

10:52.590 --> 10:54.573
But James
is my brother.

10:54.575 --> 10:56.592
But Robin lets me do sex to her.

10:56.594 --> 10:58.177
But I have

10:58.179 --> 11:00.846
to spend eternity
in my mom's mausoleum.

11:00.848 --> 11:03.966
I just wish there was a way
I didn't have to take sides!

11:03.968 --> 11:06.051
What should I do?!

11:07.855 --> 11:09.088
Choose your wife.

11:09.090 --> 11:11.423
You always choose
your wife. Easy.

11:11.425 --> 11:13.976
Got any other stumpers,
like how to answer

11:13.978 --> 11:15.428
"Does this make me look fat?"

11:15.430 --> 11:17.980
Well, maybe a little around
the hips but no more than usual.

11:17.982 --> 11:19.532
You're getting married,

11:19.534 --> 11:22.100
so I will deal with that
one after your honeymoon.

11:22.102 --> 11:23.202
<i>And she did.</i>

11:23.204 --> 11:26.188
Belize was amazi...

11:29.076 --> 11:32.378
In marriage, being right is less
important than being supportive.

11:32.380 --> 11:35.798
happy wife
equals happy life.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.134
Wow, thanks.
That's some great advice, Lil.

11:38.136 --> 11:39.969
I knew I could count on you.

11:42.656 --> 11:45.007
He's gotten very respectful
with his fake listening.

11:45.009 --> 11:46.308
Anyway, Lily,

11:46.310 --> 11:47.810
I told Marshall this
already, but...

11:47.812 --> 11:49.728
don't worry about not sending
a thank you note

11:49.730 --> 11:52.148
for the coffeemaker. It's cool.

11:52.150 --> 11:55.384
Uh, we did send a thank you note
for the coffeemaker.

11:55.386 --> 11:57.987
Uh... no, you didn't.

11:57.989 --> 12:00.990
Uh... yes, we did.

12:00.992 --> 12:02.908
To Stuart and Claudia,

12:02.910 --> 12:05.778
the people who gave us
the coffeemaker.

12:05.780 --> 12:09.365
Uh...

12:09.367 --> 12:10.900
what?

12:10.902 --> 12:12.218
Hey, you two!

12:12.220 --> 12:13.469
Hey.
Hey.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.421
Hey, thanks again
for that coffeemaker.

12:15.423 --> 12:17.089
We use it all the time.

12:17.091 --> 12:19.592
Especially when Ted's over.

12:19.594 --> 12:20.676
Yeah, it's
a great machine.

12:20.678 --> 12:22.962
We have one at home
and we love it.

12:22.964 --> 12:25.848
Did I forget
to get you a wedding gift?

12:26.533 --> 12:27.716
What kind of monster am I?

12:27.718 --> 12:29.468
Mosbys always give
wedding gifts.

12:29.470 --> 12:32.221
We even have an expression:
"Wrap it before you tap it."

12:32.223 --> 12:33.472
You know,

12:33.474 --> 12:34.523
wrap the gift

12:34.525 --> 12:36.174
before you tap the person
on the shoulder

12:36.176 --> 12:37.610
and say, "Here's your gift."

12:37.612 --> 12:40.629
I will make this right.

12:41.514 --> 12:42.982
Robin? Two things:

12:42.984 --> 12:44.483
number one, are you
dropping heat right now?

12:44.485 --> 12:46.118
No.
Great.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.953
Number two.

12:47.955 --> 12:50.289
Nice.
Thanks. Anyway,

12:50.291 --> 12:51.740
I came up with an amazing plan

12:51.742 --> 12:53.292
that I think
will make everyone happy.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.862
Step one: you let my mom win the
ring back in a hand of poker.

12:56.864 --> 12:58.747
Step two...

12:58.749 --> 12:59.915
No, that's all the steps.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.050
What do you think?

13:01.052 --> 13:04.053
So your plan is
you do absolutely nothing

13:04.055 --> 13:05.588
to get your fiancée's back.

13:05.590 --> 13:06.722
Okay.

13:06.724 --> 13:09.058
Let me propose
a different plan.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.392
Step one...

13:10.394 --> 13:13.178
Good game, everybody!

13:13.180 --> 13:15.331
And that's all the steps.

13:19.152 --> 13:22.021
That's a really
pretty bra, Mom.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.434
Well, I'd better leave now
before I lose

13:27.435 --> 13:28.717
any more of my dignity,

13:28.719 --> 13:30.319
the likelihood
of which

13:30.321 --> 13:33.889
is increasing every moment
in this very chilly room.

13:33.891 --> 13:35.641
Oh...

13:36.443 --> 13:38.761
Not good, Robin.

13:38.763 --> 13:40.396
Very not good.

13:40.398 --> 13:42.131
How do you
keep winning, anyway?

13:42.133 --> 13:43.632
Well, to the keen observer,

13:43.634 --> 13:47.553
all of you Stinsons have
the same <i>very</i> subtle tell.

13:48.188 --> 13:49.104
Whenever you're bluffing,

13:49.106 --> 13:50.940
you say the word "bluff."

13:50.942 --> 13:52.558
Hey, I'm hungry. Uh...

13:52.560 --> 13:54.426
should we get
some bluffalo wings?

13:54.428 --> 13:57.062
Raise you $20.

13:57.064 --> 14:00.616
When I walked in, I saw
an all-you-can-eat bluffet.

14:00.618 --> 14:02.768
Raise $50.

14:02.770 --> 14:06.038
Mmm... I could use
a bluffberry muffin.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.073
A blueberry bluffin. Sorry.

14:08.075 --> 14:11.126
A bluebluffy muffbluff. All in.

14:11.128 --> 14:12.294
I don't believe it.

14:12.296 --> 14:14.380
Robin, you've got
to give her that blouse back.

14:14.382 --> 14:15.781
She loves that blouse.

14:15.783 --> 14:20.719
She got those sequins from
Rick James...'s open casket.

14:20.721 --> 14:21.921
Nope. Not happening.

14:21.923 --> 14:25.975
Woman, as your bridegroom,
I command you!

14:25.977 --> 14:27.259
We'll leave and

14:27.261 --> 14:30.295
give you guys
some privacy.

14:31.064 --> 14:32.965
You, uh,

14:32.967 --> 14:35.017
want to take back
that "I command you" thing?

14:35.019 --> 14:36.352
Please can I?

14:36.354 --> 14:38.437
Why is this so important to you?

14:38.439 --> 14:40.272
Because it's my family.

14:40.274 --> 14:44.159
And, so help me, you and I
will never have sex again

14:44.161 --> 14:46.144
if you don't give back
their bluff.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.830
Stuff! Damn it.

14:47.832 --> 14:49.815
Look, I just...
I want to feel like

14:49.817 --> 14:52.368
you're on my side
once in a while. That's all.

14:52.370 --> 14:53.535
Look, I'm gonna
be your wife,

14:53.537 --> 14:54.870
for God's sakes.

14:54.872 --> 14:56.221
But, look,

14:56.223 --> 14:58.958
if it's... if it's
that important to you, here.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.159
Do what you want.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.845
Thank you.

15:02.847 --> 15:06.682
And please don't play
strip poker with my mom again.

15:06.684 --> 15:09.835
It's all kinds of confusing.

15:17.678 --> 15:21.814
Oh, that's where
my phone is.

15:21.816 --> 15:24.116
I wasn't eavesdropping.
Hey, baby.

15:24.118 --> 15:25.951
Lily, we were wrong
the whole time.

15:25.953 --> 15:27.569
Ted got us the coffeemaker!

15:27.571 --> 15:29.021
He's a wonderful man!

15:29.023 --> 15:33.025
What? No. Claudia and Stuart
gave us our coffeemaker.

15:33.027 --> 15:35.861
Ted's a rat bastard!
Never mention his name again!

15:35.863 --> 15:36.879
Your coffeemaker?

15:36.881 --> 15:37.830
Ted got you that.

15:37.832 --> 15:38.914
I was with him
when he bought it.

15:38.916 --> 15:40.215
I don't know what to feel!

15:40.217 --> 15:42.267
But Stuart said
he got it for us.

15:42.269 --> 15:44.086
Stuart and Claudia
checked in.

15:44.088 --> 15:45.587
I saw them in the lobby.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.540
Let's go get
to the bottom of this.

15:52.595 --> 15:53.562
Stuart,

15:53.564 --> 15:55.397
no B.S., did you really get us

15:55.399 --> 15:57.232
that coffeemaker
for our wedding?

15:57.234 --> 15:58.667
Of course.

15:58.669 --> 16:01.170
What a crazy
thing to ask.

16:01.172 --> 16:02.705
They never give you enough
of these things.

16:02.707 --> 16:04.773
Oh, my God.

16:04.775 --> 16:06.859
Ted got us
that coffeemaker,

16:06.861 --> 16:09.078
and you just played it off
as your gift.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.247
You're a weasel. Admit it.

16:12.249 --> 16:13.332
No, that's insane.

16:13.334 --> 16:14.399
Really?

16:14.834 --> 16:15.834
Housekeeping!

16:15.836 --> 16:16.919
Conditioner thief!

16:16.921 --> 16:18.837
Okay, shh, shh.
Yes, I am a weasel.

16:18.839 --> 16:22.041
I ripped the card off Ted's gift
and I wrote my name on it.

16:22.043 --> 16:23.926
Does Claudia know about this?

16:23.928 --> 16:26.512
No. Please don't tell her.

16:26.514 --> 16:29.465
That gift was a turning point
for us.

16:29.467 --> 16:31.133
Ah.

16:31.135 --> 16:33.068
I got to admit,

16:33.070 --> 16:36.855
I came pretty close
to leaving you.

16:36.857 --> 16:39.692
Bags packed, plane
ticket purchased,

16:39.694 --> 16:41.927
topless pics sent to your
brother, the whole nine.

16:41.929 --> 16:46.065
But seeing that you got our
friends such a nice gift,

16:46.067 --> 16:49.501
ah, it just really puts
you in a whole new light.

16:49.503 --> 16:51.704
Oh.

16:52.622 --> 16:56.158
I'm a pretty great guy.
Oh.

16:58.211 --> 16:59.840
And since that day, on the

16:59.865 --> 17:01.564
foundation of that coffeemaker,

17:01.565 --> 17:05.617
we've built a strong,
nurturing relationship.

17:05.618 --> 17:10.454
Well, out of respect for your
marriage, I won't say anything.

17:10.457 --> 17:13.058
Say hi to Claudia
when she gets out of the shower.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.843
That's not Claudia. Good night.

17:16.396 --> 17:18.180
Tap tap.

17:18.182 --> 17:20.148
Look what I wrapped!

17:20.784 --> 17:21.950
What?

17:23.971 --> 17:26.771
So, I went to give James
his ring back...

17:27.490 --> 17:29.992
Glad you came
to your senses.

17:29.994 --> 17:32.778
You can't let being married
keep you from being you.

17:32.780 --> 17:33.946
It's like Tom,

17:33.948 --> 17:36.314
always telling me I spend
too much time at the gym.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.399
Exactly. Is it so wrong

17:37.401 --> 17:39.151
if you want to work out
a couple times a week?

17:39.153 --> 17:40.986
Right. Or a couple times a day.

17:40.988 --> 17:42.204
Or a couple times...

17:42.206 --> 17:44.256
A couple times a day? Really?

17:44.258 --> 17:47.042
A few hours before work,
a few hours after.

17:47.044 --> 17:50.129
Only way to keep up
the chocolate xylophone.

17:51.615 --> 17:53.849
Still, that's a lot of time
at the gym.

17:53.851 --> 17:55.501
Especially with two kids.

17:55.503 --> 17:56.852
It's like
I always said to Tom,

17:56.854 --> 17:58.804
"I've got to stay in shape

17:58.806 --> 18:00.172
in case I'm ever single again."

18:00.174 --> 18:02.741
And, hello, I was right.

18:02.743 --> 18:05.394
Oh, my God.

18:05.396 --> 18:08.113
I think I finally understand
what Lily was mumbling

18:08.115 --> 18:10.199
in my peripheral vision earlier.

18:11.034 --> 18:12.401
I'm marrying Robin

18:12.403 --> 18:13.852
so I can be part of a team,

18:13.854 --> 18:16.405
not just some guy alone at a gym

18:16.407 --> 18:18.207
with admittedly amazing abs.

18:18.209 --> 18:19.374
Thanks, Bro.

18:19.376 --> 18:22.361
No. Thank you, Bro.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.548
You're not getting this ring.

18:26.550 --> 18:28.801
I'm always gonna have your back.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.352
No matter what.

18:30.354 --> 18:32.805
Thank you.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.289
I love you.
Mmm,

18:34.291 --> 18:35.974
I love you, too.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.377
Oh, oh! I almost didn't
tell you the best part!

18:39.379 --> 18:40.212
There's more!

18:40.214 --> 18:41.463
Really?

18:41.465 --> 18:44.099
James, let me spell this out
for you:

18:44.101 --> 18:46.151
now that I've got Robin,

18:46.153 --> 18:48.737
we are not brothers anymore.

18:48.739 --> 18:49.655
What?!

18:49.657 --> 18:51.323
Uh-huh.

18:51.325 --> 18:53.075
If you and
Robin are both

18:53.077 --> 18:55.077
ever hanging from a cliff

18:55.079 --> 18:56.995
and I have one hand free,

18:56.997 --> 18:58.363
enjoy the fall.

18:58.365 --> 18:59.865
Uh, buh-bye.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.417
If you...
Oh, Mom! Good!

19:02.419 --> 19:03.535
You should hear this, too.

19:03.537 --> 19:06.455
This mother-son thing--
it's over.

19:06.457 --> 19:07.756
It's been
a nice few decades,

19:07.758 --> 19:09.458
but I've got a wife now,

19:09.460 --> 19:11.409
so you mean <i>nothing</i> to me.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.345
Oh, and me coming over

19:13.347 --> 19:14.513
for Thanksgiving and Christmas,

19:14.515 --> 19:15.464
that's done!

19:15.466 --> 19:16.798
No more of that!

19:16.800 --> 19:18.016
And you know why?

19:18.018 --> 19:19.935
Because Robin said so!

19:19.937 --> 19:22.921
This came directly from her!

19:23.756 --> 19:27.592
See ya, losers!

19:27.594 --> 19:28.777
Oh, my God.

19:28.779 --> 19:29.778
Yeah.

19:29.780 --> 19:31.930
Fiancé of the year?

19:31.932 --> 19:34.983
I think I know what's next.
Oh, God.

19:34.985 --> 19:37.319
Oh, God. I can't leave this room
for the rest of the weekend.

19:37.321 --> 19:41.907
I'm sure we can find
something to do, eh?

19:41.909 --> 19:43.642
<i>Ted, I'm so sorry!</i>

19:43.644 --> 19:45.627
No, I'm sorry.

19:45.629 --> 19:47.546
I shouldn't have spent the last
six years passive-aggressively

19:47.548 --> 19:49.581
drinking gallons
of coffee around you.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.133
And I shouldn't have taken
that sewing class

19:51.135 --> 19:53.502
to learn how to make
that wedding present costume.

19:53.504 --> 19:55.671
I regret all of it.
Me, too!

19:55.673 --> 19:57.973
Except I actually don't regret
that sewing class.

19:57.975 --> 20:00.458
I learned a fun and useful
lifetime skill.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.312
But, seriously,
even without the coffeemaker,

20:03.314 --> 20:05.314
you've given us more
than enough.

20:05.316 --> 20:08.483
Well, there is one more gift
on the way.

20:08.485 --> 20:10.903
Whatever it is, send it back.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.971
It's a little late for that.

20:14.073 --> 20:15.691
Marshall Eriksen?!

20:15.693 --> 20:17.075
Yes?!

20:17.077 --> 20:19.528
I got your pizza!

20:19.530 --> 20:21.113
Oh, Ted!

20:21.115 --> 20:23.248
You are the best friend ever!

20:23.250 --> 20:24.950
Don't say another word,
Marshall.

20:24.952 --> 20:27.319
Save it for the thank you note.

20:27.321 --> 20:28.486
You got it, buddy!

20:28.488 --> 20:29.621
<i>And, kids,</i>

20:29.623 --> 20:30.706
<i>I got that thank you note</i>

20:30.708 --> 20:33.658
<i>four months later.</i>

20:33.660 --> 20:35.877
<i>Four months.</i>

20:39.127 --> 20:40.360
Uh, here's
your blouse back.

20:41.350 --> 20:43.167
Is there any way
we could just, um...

20:43.169 --> 20:44.702
forget about all this?

20:44.704 --> 20:47.521
Oh, no, dear,
you keep the blouse.

20:47.523 --> 20:50.458
Think of it
as your consolation prize.

20:50.460 --> 20:51.959
Consolation prize?

20:52.794 --> 20:55.079
You won the battle.

20:55.081 --> 20:57.248
But I'll win the war.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.201
Game on, bitch.

21:01.203 --> 21:06.203
