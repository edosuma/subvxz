00:02.306 --> 00:03.090
MARTIN: ...the brachial plexus
all the way down

00:03.133 --> 00:06.658
through to the fingertips.

00:06.702 --> 00:09.313
And that's how we feel touch.

00:09.357 --> 00:12.664
[echoing]: They call it
the "eye of the hand."

00:12.708 --> 00:14.492
BRIGHT [echoing]:
It's amazing.

00:14.536 --> 00:17.017
MARTIN [echoing]:
Well, that is just like you.

00:18.496 --> 00:23.240
[indistinct voice on radio]

00:23.284 --> 00:26.417
TV REPORTER [echoing]:
The NYPD arrested Dr. Martin Whitly in connection

00:26.461 --> 00:29.029
to at least 23 murders...

00:36.079 --> 00:38.168
You want the wall here,Miss?

00:38.212 --> 00:40.518
Was I not clear?

00:40.562 --> 00:44.131
I never want
to see this room again.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.705
[ringing]

00:53.749 --> 00:55.751
[thudding]

00:59.059 --> 01:00.843
[light switch clicks]

01:00.886 --> 01:03.063
[phone continues ringing]

01:10.113 --> 01:12.376
MAN:
I was wondering
if anyone would answer.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.639
BRIGHT:
Who is this?

01:14.683 --> 01:16.076
An old friend of your father's.

01:18.121 --> 01:21.081
Who are you?
Why are you calling?

01:21.124 --> 01:22.473
It was good
to see you at that

01:22.517 --> 01:23.909
junkyard, Malcolm.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.737
Been too long.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.566
-How do I know you?
-You don't remember?

01:28.610 --> 01:31.787
A hell of a camping trip.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.665
Is it okay if I call you Paul?

01:40.709 --> 01:42.667
Or would you prefer
something else?

01:42.711 --> 01:45.105
Always liked Paul.
Good, strong name.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.934
Okay, Paul?

01:48.978 --> 01:51.850
-Why don't you tell me
about this trip?
-That's curious.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.896
Wonder why you don't remember.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.246
[chuckles]

01:56.290 --> 01:58.030
I could never forget
that night.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.120
BRIGHT:
Why? What happened?

02:00.163 --> 02:03.384
Talk to me, I'd-I'd love
to hear it in your own words.

02:08.998 --> 02:11.043
To be honest, Paul...

02:11.087 --> 02:14.046
I think I've blocked out
pieces of my memory.

02:14.090 --> 02:18.529
Whole chunks of time
are missing.

02:18.573 --> 02:19.791
Any idea what
might have caused that?

02:19.835 --> 02:22.620
Why were you delivered
to me, Malcolm?

02:22.664 --> 02:25.406
To help me or stop me?

02:25.449 --> 02:27.799
-Uh, I just want to talk.
-No.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.453
You're a cop.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.412
You want to catch me.

02:31.455 --> 02:35.155
Your dad must be...

02:35.198 --> 02:36.982
-disappointed.
-Well,

02:37.026 --> 02:39.289
we're not exactly on
speaking terms at the moment.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.725
I don't want

02:40.769 --> 02:42.379
to hurt you, Malcolm.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.164
But my work is important,

02:44.207 --> 02:45.469
and you've interrupted it.

02:45.513 --> 02:48.037
I hate being interrupted!

02:50.866 --> 02:52.259
Better if you leave me alone.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.651
You know I can't do that.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.524
That's not
what I wanted to hear.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.669
Who the hell wasthat?

03:11.713 --> 03:13.845
An old friend of Dad's.

03:18.894 --> 03:22.680
People who suffer
from our sickness

03:22.724 --> 03:26.118
have a tendency to find others

03:26.162 --> 03:28.208
who suffer from it, too.

03:28.251 --> 03:31.211
In this case, I was, um,

03:31.254 --> 03:32.690
a mentor.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.954
[tapping keyboard]

03:35.998 --> 03:37.695
[audio playing faintly]

03:37.739 --> 03:40.394

03:42.744 --> 03:46.704

03:46.748 --> 03:48.184
Ains.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.710
Ains.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.714
Hey...

03:57.933 --> 03:59.500
How are you feeling?

03:59.543 --> 04:02.894
Like I was stabbed
in the chest with a prison shiv.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.201
So, like, six out of ten?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.333
[chuckles]

04:08.291 --> 04:09.901
What were you working on?

04:09.945 --> 04:13.949
I was looking
at interview footage.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.126
Think we really captured
television gold.

04:19.215 --> 04:23.785
Sorry I ruined it by,
you know... getting knifed.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.570
Yeah.

04:28.137 --> 04:31.096
It's a shame
we had to stop early, but...

04:31.140 --> 04:33.664
I think...
think it'll cut together.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.801
[indistinct radio chatter]

04:43.413 --> 04:44.980
JESSICA [echoing]:
Get him out of here.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.949
May I offer you all
some Scotch?

04:57.993 --> 05:00.300
Or vodka? Gin?

05:00.343 --> 05:02.258
I'm good with coffee.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.000
Cream and sugar?
Or a nice hazelnut liqueur?

05:14.662 --> 05:17.055
So... this is where
Malcolm Bright grew up.

05:17.099 --> 05:20.798
-It's, um... nice.
-Thank you.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.409
One day I'll give you
the full tour.

05:22.452 --> 05:25.150
But the abridged version is...

05:25.194 --> 05:27.152
that's where we usually
have the Christmas tree.

05:27.196 --> 05:30.982
That is a portrait
of my great-uncle Douglas.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.333
Oh, and right over there is

05:33.376 --> 05:36.031
where my father was arrested
for killing 23 people.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.296
It's a good-looking uncle.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.473
Sir. We've routed
the basement line through

05:43.517 --> 05:45.345
-the trap-and-trace
system at Major Crimes.
-GIL: Nice work.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.564
If he calls again,
we'll get a recording,

05:47.608 --> 05:49.914
-maybe even
a location, if we're lucky.
-He'll call again.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.743
This was just
a jumping-off point. Round one.

05:52.787 --> 05:55.920
I have to ask, if that room's
been walled off since '98,

05:55.964 --> 05:57.008
why were you still
paying the phone bill?

05:57.052 --> 05:59.489
[sighs] I have no idea.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.491
You know how
business managers are.

06:01.535 --> 06:04.625
I definitely do not know how
business managers are.

06:06.148 --> 06:10.370
Detective...
we have something to show you.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.937
-Jessica, you all right?
-[exhales, chuckles]

06:12.981 --> 06:15.375
Just peachy, Gil. [chuckles]

06:15.418 --> 06:17.638
A regular Tuesday around here.
[chuckles]

06:22.077 --> 06:24.035
We could move you
to a safe house for a few days.

06:24.079 --> 06:26.037
JESSICA:
Absolutely not.

06:26.081 --> 06:29.389
I imagine your accommodations
are about as inviting as a...

06:29.432 --> 06:30.912
Milwaukee Radisson.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.133
At least let us
leave some officers outside.

06:35.177 --> 06:38.049
[exhales]

06:38.093 --> 06:40.661
I was married to one of the most
notorious serial killers

06:40.704 --> 06:42.227
of the 20th century.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.055
I can look after myself.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.500
Don't worry, I'll post
a patrol unit.

06:53.543 --> 06:54.979
Jessica doesn't need to know.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.677
Thanks, Gil.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.374
Till we know what he wants
from me and my family,

06:58.418 --> 07:00.420
we should assume he's a threat.

07:00.463 --> 07:03.945
You know, the brass is talking
about bringing in the Bureau.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.208
That would be a mistake.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.905
They'd force me off this
in a heartbeat.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.516
Would that be such a bad thing?

07:09.559 --> 07:11.343
I'm worried
you're too close to it.

07:11.387 --> 07:14.738
You're right. I am.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.306
But that's exactly
how we're gonna get him.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.353
Based on our conversation,
I now believe Paul to be

07:21.397 --> 07:22.833
a mission-oriented killer.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.096
He referred to his murders
as his "work"

07:25.140 --> 07:27.534
and asked me why I had been
"delivered" to him.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.711
The word choices evoke
a higher calling.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.582
That, coupled with
the victim pool

07:32.626 --> 07:35.106
from the junkyard--
all high-risk addicts,

07:35.150 --> 07:36.717
homeless, sex workers--

07:36.760 --> 07:38.283
tells me that
Paul views his "mission"

07:38.327 --> 07:39.937
as cleaning up the streets.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.765
You forgot to mention
the elephant in the room.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.767
Of course.
We also know the killer

07:43.811 --> 07:45.116
had a relationship
with Martin Whitly.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.596
But we know little about it,

07:46.640 --> 07:48.468
except that they likely met

07:48.511 --> 07:50.208
at St. Edward's Hospital
in the Bronx.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.776
-Can you ask your pops?
-Couldn't if I wanted to.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.475
The Surgeon's been placed
in solitary confinement.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.477
From what I hear,
he hasn't spoken a word.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.913
-Not even to the guards.
-BRIGHT: Naturally.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.610
The one time I need
to talk to him.

08:00.654 --> 08:04.745
Edrisa, what's the status
of your ID process?

08:04.788 --> 08:08.575
Uh, slow going. We are up
to 16 confirmed kills.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.491
But we have to match
the disparate fragments

08:11.534 --> 08:13.797
of bone and flesh.
It's not always obvious

08:13.841 --> 08:15.233
which go together.

08:15.277 --> 08:18.410
Like the world's
most fascinating jigsaw puzzle.

08:18.454 --> 08:19.803
[chuckling]:
Oh, you like puzzles?

08:19.847 --> 08:22.632
I have a, uh, 500-piece
of the Notre-Dame

08:22.676 --> 08:25.330
that is truly gnarly.

08:25.374 --> 08:29.639
-If you ever...
-I just, I can't,
I can't with this.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.772
-Anything we can use?
-Yes.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.429
Uh-- Two of the most
recent victims,

08:37.473 --> 08:40.911
Stephanie Reyes
and Haley Wyatt, they...

08:40.955 --> 08:43.261
-don't have any
stomach contents.
-JT: They're addicts, right?

08:43.305 --> 08:45.176
They're not exactly known
for their appetites.

08:45.220 --> 08:48.092
True, but still, it's unusual
to find nothing at all.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.530
Unless they were held for days
without food and water.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.009
Exactly.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.271
Does this fit with your profile?

08:53.315 --> 08:54.664
Mission-oriented killers often

08:54.708 --> 08:56.536
take a ritualistic approach
to murder.

08:56.579 --> 09:00.235
Which could certainly involve
an extended holding period.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.977
Paul said I interrupted him.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.283
I thought he meant
his killings in general, but...

09:05.327 --> 09:06.850
what if
he'd already taken someone?

09:06.894 --> 09:07.982
What if we missed something?

09:09.244 --> 09:10.375
Let's go find out.

09:18.732 --> 09:22.562
Okay. So, we know
he crushed them there.

09:23.911 --> 09:26.217
[screaming]

09:26.261 --> 09:28.132
But he would have required
a holding area.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.134
A hidden sanctum
where he prepped the victims.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.659
The techs have been over this
place with a fine-tooth comb.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.225
-Do you think
it could've been off-site?
-No.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.879
Transport would've been
a needless risk.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.577
He needed them close.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.883
Close enough that
he could move the victims

09:39.927 --> 09:42.146
to the kill site without ever
being in view of the street.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.891
Paul shot at me from over there.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.111
He felt the need
to protect something.

09:52.113 --> 09:55.725
BRIGHT:
This is the one place
we didn't find a body.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.345
GIL:
What are you seeing, Bright?

10:07.389 --> 10:08.608
BRIGHT:
I think this is an air vent.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.102
-What the hell is that?
-[panting]

10:25.146 --> 10:27.452
BRIGHT:
This must be
where he brought his victims.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.976
[chuckling]

10:31.587 --> 10:34.634
If I'm not mistaken,
it's a Winnebago.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.027
Get the bomb squad

10:37.071 --> 10:38.942
-and ESU down here.
-Roger that.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.292
Go. To Central.
I need a bomb squad...

10:41.336 --> 10:43.947
Bright, no!
Wait, Bright, what are you...

10:47.342 --> 10:49.300
It could be booby-trapped!

10:49.344 --> 10:51.346
He's not trying
to keep someone out.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.349
He wants to keep someone in.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.919
GIL:
Bright, what are you doing?

11:03.837 --> 11:05.316
Bright!

11:06.970 --> 11:09.669
Bright, what's down there?

11:09.712 --> 11:12.497
-[clinking]
-Wait. I just heard something.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.021
GIL:
What is it?

11:22.856 --> 11:25.032
First door is clear.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.908
GIL:
Come on, Bright, talk to me.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.348
I found a victim.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.699
GIL:
Where's ESU?
I need 'em here now!

11:51.885 --> 11:54.539
[panting]

11:54.583 --> 11:55.802
I'm sorry.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.978
[crying]:
I'm so sorry.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.370
How long do I have?

11:59.414 --> 12:00.502
It's okay.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.721
You're safe.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.723
You can't save me.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.420
No one can.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.818
DANI: We got an ID
on the victim you saved.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.864
Ryan Davis, 26.
Bronx local, addict,

12:14.908 --> 12:16.779
couple possession charges
but nothing violent.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.868
JT says he's stable,
but they had to put him

12:18.912 --> 12:20.304
in a medically induced coma.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.045
Ryan won't be answering
questions any time soon.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.004
DANI:
Crime Scene is sweeping

12:24.047 --> 12:25.875
the Winnebago for prints, but
so far it's clean as a whistle.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.398
BRIGHT:
He probably burned them off.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.052
This guy was careful
at every step.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.880
We should put Ryan
in protective custody,

12:30.924 --> 12:32.316

[water running]

36:51.165 --> 36:53.689
-I think I just saw him.
-Find somewhere that locks.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.822
Okay.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.091
Okay.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.838
Ainsley? Ainsley!

37:14.232 --> 37:16.538
He's outside. He's outside.
He's outside.

37:16.582 --> 37:18.627
-BRIGHT: Do you have a weapon?
-No.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.250
[sirens wailing]

37:36.602 --> 37:38.691
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:49.789 --> 37:51.878
You are not
gonna believe what...

37:54.010 --> 37:56.012
What are you doing?

37:56.056 --> 37:59.755
What is this?
You filmed my surgery?

37:59.799 --> 38:01.496
I was going to tell you.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.499
I just... I-I got so caught up
in the adrenaline,

38:04.543 --> 38:06.588
-and it was so compelling
that I...
-Oh, was it?

38:06.632 --> 38:10.331
Was it compelling
when I almost died?

38:10.375 --> 38:11.463
We went there to get

38:11.506 --> 38:13.595
a great story and we got one.

38:13.639 --> 38:17.251
-I was doing my job.
-I understand.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.733
This is who you are.

38:21.995 --> 38:24.040
I just...

38:24.084 --> 38:26.042
don't think that's
the kind of person

38:26.086 --> 38:27.479
I want to be with.

38:53.113 --> 38:55.985
Edrisa thinks Paul gave Ryan

38:56.029 --> 39:00.163
a heavy dose of anticoagulant
through his IV.

39:00.207 --> 39:03.079
Different means,
same dissociative method.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.473
Like the trash compactor
at the junkyard.

39:05.517 --> 39:07.257
-How's Ainsley doing?
-She's okay.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.738
Little shaken.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.350
I'm getting that
from a three-word text.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.743
Detectives are scouring
the hospital for leads.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.484
With any luck,
something will turn up.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.007
It won't.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.706
He's been two steps ahead of us
at every turn.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.751
[sighs]

39:25.711 --> 39:27.669
You saved Father Leo.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.715
Only because Paul wanted us to.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.848
He was making a point

39:32.892 --> 39:36.025
about the inevitability
of his calling.

39:36.069 --> 39:39.725
Ryan Davis was marked for death,
Father Leo wasn't.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.555
He thinks nothing can stop
his divine mission.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.339
Well, then we're just gonna
have to prove him wrong.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.569
I'll have cadaver dogs
search the fort.

39:57.612 --> 40:00.006
Maybe that's where
he buried her.

40:01.355 --> 40:03.531
I know he could be lying.

40:03.575 --> 40:05.403
I've been telling you
for 20 years

40:05.446 --> 40:07.405
she isn't real, I'm not gonna
tell you that tonight.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.843
If she's there, we'll find her.

40:13.976 --> 40:16.762
Bloodshed at a Manhattan
hospital tonight.

40:16.805 --> 40:19.329
A source inside the NYPD
has confirmed

40:19.373 --> 40:21.984
that a new serial killer
is at large,

40:22.028 --> 40:23.986
and may be connected
to Martin Whitly,

40:24.030 --> 40:25.771
better known as The Surgeon.

40:25.814 --> 40:28.164
This new killer,
who authorities are calling

40:28.208 --> 40:29.949
The Junkyard Killer,

40:29.992 --> 40:32.255
has allegedly been active
for over 20 years.

40:32.299 --> 40:34.823
-Hello, dear.
-His total number of victims
may be in the teens.

40:34.867 --> 40:36.564
Police are searching for

40:36.608 --> 40:38.218
a middle-aged
Caucasian man with...

40:40.829 --> 40:42.657
Eve Blanchard came to see me.

40:42.701 --> 40:46.095
-Isn't she a lovely young woman?
-She said that you were armed.

40:46.139 --> 40:48.620
That wretched little tattletale.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.492
Give.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.494
[sighs]

41:06.159 --> 41:08.291
She was concerned about you.

41:08.335 --> 41:10.163
So am I.

41:10.206 --> 41:12.295
This is dangerous.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.688
You know what else is dangerous?

41:13.732 --> 41:14.950
Serial killers.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.039
Which is why police officers

41:17.083 --> 41:18.954
have been watching
the house all day.

41:18.998 --> 41:20.521
Do you think I'd actually
leave you here

41:20.565 --> 41:22.349
-to fend for yourself?
-Why didn't you tell me?

41:22.392 --> 41:24.569
'Cause you would've
sent them away.

41:26.179 --> 41:27.397
If you're worried
about staying here,

41:27.441 --> 41:28.790
why don't you check into
the Plaza

41:28.834 --> 41:30.139
until this whole thing is over?

41:30.183 --> 41:32.141
You know...

41:32.185 --> 41:34.404
Miltons owned
this whole neighborhood

41:34.448 --> 41:36.319
back when it was farmland.
Bought it from

41:36.363 --> 41:38.844
the profits they made
outfitting the Hessians.

41:38.887 --> 41:40.323
Proved a sound investment.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.500
It would just be
for a few weeks.

41:42.543 --> 41:46.504
My great-great-great-grandfather

41:46.547 --> 41:49.550
built this house in 1871.

41:49.594 --> 41:52.379
And a Milton has lived here
ever since.

41:54.033 --> 41:55.991
I didn't let Martin
tarnish this house,

41:56.035 --> 41:57.863
despite what he was,

41:57.906 --> 42:00.692
and I will not
be driven out now.

42:00.735 --> 42:02.955
This is my home.

42:04.434 --> 42:06.088
I don't want to go to a hotel,

42:06.132 --> 42:08.526
and I don't want to live
under constant surveillance.

42:08.569 --> 42:11.529
I want to have a normal life.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.443
One that isn't
perpetually haunted

42:13.487 --> 42:15.881
by the ghost of your father.

42:18.318 --> 42:19.624
I want that, too.

42:22.278 --> 42:24.237
I can't promise
he'll never haunt you again,

42:24.280 --> 42:26.239
but I can promise

42:26.282 --> 42:30.025
not to stop until I've caught
the Junkyard Killer.

42:30.069 --> 42:32.071
You shouldn't
have to live in fear.

42:33.899 --> 42:35.161
[cell phone vibrating]

42:36.641 --> 42:39.731
It's Gil.
I should take this.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.299
Any news?

42:43.343 --> 42:46.433
Hey, kid. I wanted you
to hear it from me first.

42:46.476 --> 42:48.304
Your old pals at the FBI

42:48.348 --> 42:51.133
have taken over on Paul Lazar.

42:51.177 --> 42:54.441
And they have made it very clear
you're off the case.

42:54.484 --> 42:56.138
All of us are.

42:56.182 --> 42:57.618
They can't do that.

42:57.662 --> 42:59.098
I assure you they can.

42:59.141 --> 43:02.710
Feds are in charge now,

43:02.754 --> 43:04.843
and they don't like you
very much.

43:06.496 --> 43:08.498
What is it?

43:11.371 --> 43:13.678
Maybe you should keep that.

43:47.146 --> 43:48.626
MAN:
Greg, move your head.
