WEBVTT

00:01.789 --> 00:04.770
I just wanted to...
Making the final two.

00:04.806 --> 00:07.507
Darius, if you really
can't play anymore,

00:07.542 --> 00:09.108
then you have to marry Tiffany.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.854
- Well, you got Romeo shot.
- If you even...

00:10.878 --> 00:12.445
You put our suitor in the hospital.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.113
The truth incriminates Rachel.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.492
She's the one who called the cops.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.183
I'm a reporter. That woman Mary,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.384
who jumped off the roof
last year, that was a murder.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.986
- Who's your source?
- Jeremy.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.521
This piece will be unstoppable.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.801
I need you to walk us through it.

00:23.825 --> 00:25.490
We lied, we covered it up.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.492
Police should've known when Darius...

00:27.528 --> 00:28.728
'Cause we killed her.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.529
Take the medicine, sweetheart.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.231
I found a place. We'll work things out

00:32.266 --> 00:34.533
with a therapist who isn't your mother,

00:34.568 --> 00:38.670
then we are going to
burn this place down.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.640
I saw Coleman sneaking out
of Yael's room this morning.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.676
Hot version of you is
stealing your little boyfriend.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.811
You need something that
you can build an episode on.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.747
- Who's your target?
- Yael.

00:48.782 --> 00:52.016
- Go away! Oh, my God!
- Why would you... ?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.552
Quinn, what is it?

00:54.587 --> 00:56.387
You want kids, and I can't have them.

00:56.422 --> 00:58.422
I won't be anybody's disappointment.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.424
- I have work to do.
- Quinn?

01:00.460 --> 01:02.235
Are you really going
to let me walk away?

01:02.260 --> 01:02.827
Yes.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.563
Coleman knows about Mary.
He's about to expose us.

01:05.598 --> 01:06.930
I am so sorry, Quinn.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.866
We really have to stop them.

01:16.976 --> 01:18.942
- Hey, babe, what's up?
- Hey.

01:18.978 --> 01:20.778
- Um...
- Hands off the keyboard, please.

01:20.813 --> 01:22.946
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What's going on?

01:22.982 --> 01:25.983
My guys have been instructed
to confiscate every piece

01:26.018 --> 01:28.385
of electronic equipment in this office

01:28.420 --> 01:31.655
and to ferret out any backups
or cloud-based versions

01:31.690 --> 01:33.290
you might have already uploaded.

01:33.325 --> 01:35.325
Rachel, why are you doing this?

01:35.360 --> 01:38.060
Uh, I don't know. Maybe because
I don't want to get carted off

01:38.096 --> 01:39.763
to some beautiful institution

01:39.798 --> 01:41.598
while you take down "Everlasting."

01:41.633 --> 01:44.100
I know. I know that that's
what you think is best for me,

01:44.135 --> 01:45.769
but I actually know what's best for me.

01:45.804 --> 01:47.937
- Which is this.
- This is crazy, Rachel.

01:47.972 --> 01:49.839
See, that's where you're
wrong again, Coleman.

01:49.874 --> 01:51.474
Um, I'm not crazy.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.943
In fact, I'm smart enough
to call your ex-girlfriend,

01:53.978 --> 01:55.812
who told me that she
didn't break up with you

01:55.847 --> 01:57.280
because you moved to Hollywood.

01:57.315 --> 01:59.282
No, she actually broke up with you

01:59.317 --> 02:02.819
when she found that you paid
off some downtrodden Asian extras

02:02.854 --> 02:05.288
to impersonate the Cambodian sex slaves

02:05.323 --> 02:07.356
in your award-winning documentary.

02:07.391 --> 02:08.991
Shocking.

02:09.026 --> 02:11.527
So it turns out that you're
just as full of shit as we are.

02:11.562 --> 02:13.796
Now what's going to happen is this...

02:13.831 --> 02:16.665
You are going to keep
your mouth shut about us,

02:16.701 --> 02:19.435
we will keep our mouths shut about you,

02:19.470 --> 02:21.872
and everyone will live
happily ever after.

02:25.976 --> 02:27.209
I win.

02:27.244 --> 02:29.610
Again.

02:33.516 --> 02:35.884
Move it.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.261 --> 02:48.496
Tonight on "Everlasting,"

02:48.531 --> 02:52.834
Darius will make his final
choice live on the air.

02:52.869 --> 02:56.136
Okay, now step back, Graham.
This isn't a fricking three-way.

02:56.172 --> 02:58.706
Keep B cam on Tiffany. I want
plenty of snarky eye rolls

02:58.742 --> 03:01.153
and that "I just smelled a fart"
thing she does with her face.

03:01.177 --> 03:04.411
That. Yes. Perfect. That's perfect.

03:04.446 --> 03:05.679
You're back.

03:05.714 --> 03:07.547
Indeed. What do you got, Jay?

03:07.583 --> 03:11.585
Got flowers, we've got dresses,
I've got blinding diamond rings.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.988
Actually, I don't have
a horse-drawn carriage

03:14.023 --> 03:17.391
because, apparently, the Clydesdales
dinged the driveway last season,

03:17.426 --> 03:18.658
- but...
- Locations was mad.

03:18.694 --> 03:20.059
Okay, whatever.

03:20.095 --> 03:21.828
Everything else is a romance explosion.

03:21.864 --> 03:23.363
Mmm, that's great.

03:23.399 --> 03:26.933
But people want a shit-show, literally.

03:26.968 --> 03:30.003
If last week's ratings
were any indication,

03:30.038 --> 03:32.406
none of this love-dovey boondoggle.

03:32.441 --> 03:34.840
Whatever happened to selling true love?

03:34.876 --> 03:37.243
Yeah, that's over.

03:37.279 --> 03:41.414
I want to see a bitch
bleed. Thank you. Let's go.

03:41.449 --> 03:45.751
Let's see what we have
today, shall we, Rachel?

03:45.787 --> 03:48.854
As you can see, I don't
just envision our lives

03:48.890 --> 03:50.188
to just be the two of us.

03:50.224 --> 03:51.624
Vision boards, wow.

03:51.659 --> 03:53.726
I did that when I was
in the third grade.

03:53.761 --> 03:56.128
We can be a beacon of light
for all those around us.

03:56.163 --> 03:58.030
"A beacon of light"?
Who talks like that?

03:58.065 --> 03:59.799
Just light the flame.

03:59.834 --> 04:02.701
Thank you, Chantal. That was beautiful.

04:02.737 --> 04:05.938
And, uh, last but not
least, Tiffany, you're up.

04:07.341 --> 04:09.041
Darius, I mean, sure

04:09.076 --> 04:11.910
we could hang out at my
family's ranch and ride horses.

04:11.946 --> 04:15.388
Oh, you can hang out at
your ranch. You're so rich.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.416
... is filled with a bit
more adventure than that.

04:17.451 --> 04:19.084
Oh, my God.

04:19.119 --> 04:21.286
Hey, uh, C camera,

04:21.322 --> 04:24.956
could you do a close-up
on Tiffany's ankle, please.

04:24.991 --> 04:27.391
Passion, excitement, desire.

04:27.427 --> 04:30.094
Unbelievable.

04:30.129 --> 04:32.630
Exciting.

04:32.666 --> 04:34.732
Thank you, Tiffany. That, uh...

04:34.768 --> 04:36.579
I'll have to... Sounds exciting.
What are you even talking about?

04:36.603 --> 04:38.135
- So, uh, what?
- America...

04:38.171 --> 04:39.736
You're screwing her now?

04:42.475 --> 04:44.408
How did you know that?

04:44.444 --> 04:47.111
The anklet.

04:47.146 --> 04:51.415
It's your move. Your only move, Chet.

04:51.451 --> 04:54.118
You give one to every person
you become infatuated with.

04:54.153 --> 04:57.420
Hell, you even gave one to
me when I was still a PA.

04:57.456 --> 04:59.690
You remembered.

04:59.725 --> 05:01.959
- Is Quinn a little jealous?
- Mm.

05:01.994 --> 05:04.528
- You wish.
- Mm.

05:04.563 --> 05:06.463
It's a taste issue, Chet.

05:06.499 --> 05:08.431
It was tacky then, and it's tacky now.

05:11.403 --> 05:14.104
So I'm supposed to get engaged tonight

05:14.139 --> 05:15.261
to one of these girls?

05:15.262 --> 05:18.008
No, not one of these girls. To Tiffany.

05:18.043 --> 05:19.775
Remember, we talked about this.

05:19.811 --> 05:21.011
It's true, D.

05:21.046 --> 05:23.013
She's got the dad, the connections.

05:23.048 --> 05:24.614
That's the only reason I'm back here,

05:24.649 --> 05:26.149
to make sure this really happens.

05:26.184 --> 05:28.184
You need to get your head
in the game, my brother.

05:28.220 --> 05:30.119
Exactly. And pretty soon,

05:30.154 --> 05:31.799
we're going to have to come
clean about this injury.

05:31.823 --> 05:34.690
So unless you plan on
moving out to the boonies

05:34.726 --> 05:37.727
to like, run a used car dealership
for the rest of your life,

05:37.762 --> 05:39.194
we need a decision.

05:39.230 --> 05:41.296
Which I thought we'd already made,

05:41.332 --> 05:44.867
but regardless, we have
to prep for a winner.

05:44.903 --> 05:48.137
I like how you guys got all the answers.

05:50.508 --> 05:53.308
What now?

05:53.344 --> 05:54.809
It's Tiffany.

05:54.845 --> 05:57.879
Oh! Congratulations!

05:57.915 --> 05:59.181
Mazel Tov.

05:59.216 --> 06:00.682
Uh, yeah.

06:00.717 --> 06:02.918
You know, I think, uh, Tiffany

06:02.953 --> 06:04.920
is going to be perfect, actually.

06:04.955 --> 06:07.321
Why would... Wh-what did
you say it like that for?

06:07.357 --> 06:08.116
What's... ?

06:08.141 --> 06:10.392
You know, why don't you just
get back out there, okay?

06:10.427 --> 06:12.827
Because my diamond guy's setting up.

06:12.863 --> 06:14.996
Just make sure that Tiffany
picks the emerald cut,

06:15.032 --> 06:17.198
'cause like it or not,
that's what she's getting.

06:17.233 --> 06:20.000
And you, why don't you go do something?

06:20.036 --> 06:21.902
How about you, Wags?

06:21.938 --> 06:23.382
- What?
- You're just going to sit there?

06:23.406 --> 06:25.273
Oh, no. Uh, no, you know I never listen.

06:25.308 --> 06:27.775
Yeah. Why don't you
just make yourself busy?

06:27.810 --> 06:29.677
I will.

06:29.712 --> 06:32.246
Now let the real work
begin. You ready to do this?

06:32.282 --> 06:34.115
Born ready. What do you got?

06:34.150 --> 06:39.382
Well, I need you to produce Yael
to get her ass back on camera.

06:39.383 --> 06:39.920
No.

06:39.956 --> 06:41.622
I need her for the finale.

06:41.657 --> 06:43.090
That girl hates me.

06:43.125 --> 06:45.092
I made her shit her pants
on national television.

06:45.127 --> 06:48.228
I know. It was fantastic.

06:48.263 --> 06:51.731
But she's part of a
much larger plan, okay?

06:52.834 --> 06:56.636
Trust me. It's going to be epic.

07:03.512 --> 07:05.245
They're only letting you keep the car

07:05.280 --> 07:06.913
'cause nobody else wanted it.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.826
I can't believe you could
even show your face to me.

07:08.850 --> 07:10.628
- You have balls.
- Oh, my God, you're such a dick, dude.

07:10.652 --> 07:12.318
Hot Rachel? I mean, seriously?

07:12.353 --> 07:13.953
You just couldn't control yourself.

07:13.989 --> 07:16.422
Oh, you had just revealed
some fairly alarming details

07:16.457 --> 07:18.992
about your mother, about
Mary, about who you really are.

07:19.027 --> 07:21.628
I'd say the instinct to run away
from all that's pretty human.

07:21.663 --> 07:25.764
Oh. So I'm just too damaged
to bring to your Puritan,

07:25.799 --> 07:28.634
stick-in-the-ass family
wedding in Chilmark?

07:28.669 --> 07:31.036
That's just not what my family is about.

07:35.009 --> 07:36.775
And your family knows, right?

07:36.810 --> 07:39.612
That your whole career is based on lies?

07:39.647 --> 07:42.014
Do they?

07:42.049 --> 07:45.117
I'm not going to let
you touch this place.

07:45.152 --> 07:49.788
Because this "Everlasting"
is all you have left now.

07:49.823 --> 07:51.857
That's sad.

07:51.892 --> 07:55.460
- And Quinn and all the other vagabond...
- Mm-hmm.

07:55.495 --> 07:57.629
... orphan misfits that work here,

07:57.664 --> 08:00.097
they are the only people
who will ever accept you

08:00.133 --> 08:03.368
for the broken, damaged,
vile person that you are.

08:03.403 --> 08:05.181
All right, guys, you can
take him away now, thank you.

08:05.205 --> 08:07.505
- I promise you this is not over.
- Let's go.

08:16.152 --> 08:20.514
"Ring shopping"... two words
which inspire butterflies

08:20.515 --> 08:22.680
in the bellies of women
all over the world.

08:23.251 --> 08:24.872
Now, if Darius decides
to take that next step

08:24.896 --> 08:29.231
with either one of
you tonight on live TV,

08:29.266 --> 08:33.469
then one of these beautiful
baubles could be yours.

08:35.272 --> 08:37.172
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

08:37.495 --> 08:40.128
Hmm. Distract them with sparkles.

08:40.164 --> 08:42.509
- These are gorgeous! Oh, my gosh.
- Look at this one! That is amazing.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.800
Hey. You wanted me?

08:44.835 --> 08:48.003
Yes. Uh, go get Tiffany for me.

08:48.038 --> 08:49.582
- Yeah, but they're doing the diamond...
- Right now.

08:49.606 --> 08:51.306
Yep. Okay.

08:53.677 --> 08:55.010
Hi.

08:55.045 --> 08:56.344
What?

08:56.379 --> 08:57.819
All right, look, I know I'm probably

08:57.848 --> 08:59.580
the last person you
want to see right now.

08:59.616 --> 09:01.382
You poisoned me.

09:01.418 --> 09:03.852
You humiliated me on
national television,

09:03.887 --> 09:05.753
and you and Quinn just,
what, laughed about it?

09:05.789 --> 09:08.155
No. And I'm sorry, okay?

09:08.191 --> 09:10.991
It was all my idea, and
I know that it was wrong.

09:11.027 --> 09:13.105
Uh, Quinn just wants to
speak to you right over there.

09:13.129 --> 09:14.507
- Oh. Is... Okay.
- Thank you. Yeah.

09:14.531 --> 09:16.230
Hi. Hey, Quinn.

09:16.265 --> 09:19.033
Hi. Uh, okay, here's the deal.

09:19.068 --> 09:22.036
Technically, I'm not supposed
to be telling you this,

09:22.071 --> 09:25.206
but... it's you.

09:26.742 --> 09:28.909
Darius is picking you.

09:29.946 --> 09:32.079
Oh, my God.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.348
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

09:34.383 --> 09:36.550
Ahh! That's amazing.

09:36.585 --> 09:37.885
It is, isn't it?

09:37.920 --> 09:39.586
And yet, there's more.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.456
Um, not only is Darius
going to propose to you,

09:42.491 --> 09:47.794
but he wants to marry you
tonight on live television.

09:47.830 --> 09:50.029
Oh, my God. That's unbelievable.

09:50.065 --> 09:52.966
It is unbelievable, isn't it?

09:53.001 --> 09:55.935
So you're going to need to get
your family here right away.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.604
Okay, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
I'll call my dad right now.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.240
He's going to be so stoked.

10:00.275 --> 10:02.308
Oh, I bet.

10:02.344 --> 10:04.543
Thank you. I cannot say that enough.

10:04.579 --> 10:06.045
Oh, you can, actually.

10:06.081 --> 10:07.747
And there's... There's one more thing.

10:07.782 --> 10:10.283
I'm going to need you to dump Chet.

10:11.586 --> 10:14.920
What are you... talking
about? I'm not...

10:14.955 --> 10:16.455
Uh, Tiffany?

10:16.491 --> 10:19.625
That really can't be happening

10:19.660 --> 10:22.728
if you're going to
marry Darius now, can it?

10:22.764 --> 10:24.963
Nope. You're absolutely right.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.800
- Consider it done.
- Oh, I do.

10:29.169 --> 10:31.469
Hey, can we just be
honest for one second?

10:31.505 --> 10:34.139
Probably just a lot of,
like, internalized misogyny,

10:34.174 --> 10:36.641
you know, like I hate you
but I really hate myself.

10:36.676 --> 10:39.744
I mean, I'm a feminist,
and this is what I do.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.914
No, do not try to Sarah Lawrence me.

10:41.949 --> 10:44.316
I'm not an idiot. You're dangerous.

10:44.351 --> 10:46.651
And from what Coleman tells
me, you're actually crazy,

10:46.686 --> 10:49.153
which makes you even more dangerous.

10:49.188 --> 10:55.627
Okay, so, um, can I at least
try to make it up to you?

10:55.662 --> 10:58.596
'Cause I could help you change
the narrative if you wanted.

10:58.632 --> 11:01.299
Quinn needs somebody
to go on camera tonight

11:01.334 --> 11:03.301
to confront Tiffany
about some hidden secret.

11:03.336 --> 11:05.669
You could be the truth teller.

11:05.704 --> 11:08.272
So you want me to go on television

11:08.308 --> 11:12.143
and shame another girl just
to get the focus off of myself?

11:12.178 --> 11:13.610
This is what's wrong with America,

11:13.646 --> 11:15.146
women constantly hurting other women.

11:15.181 --> 11:17.281
Got it, Hillary, no problem.

11:17.317 --> 11:19.550
I was just trying to tell
you that all of that cameras

11:19.585 --> 11:21.885
would be focused on you,
every eye in America.

11:21.921 --> 11:23.787
You would be the star.

11:23.823 --> 11:25.983
Isn't that really why you
came here in the first place?

11:28.957 --> 11:31.406
Just saying there's a lot more
you can get out of this show,

11:31.430 --> 11:33.229
besides a husband.

11:42.174 --> 11:44.374
Quinn, I don't understand.

11:44.409 --> 11:46.476
You told both the girls
that they're going to win.

11:46.511 --> 11:47.877
Of course I did.

11:47.912 --> 11:50.013
And that Darius wants to marry them.

11:50.048 --> 11:51.881
Ugh. Listen to me.

11:51.916 --> 11:54.517
Last season, when Anna was triumphantly

11:54.552 --> 11:58.621
walking up the staircase and
wearing that poof of a dress,

11:58.656 --> 12:01.423
I realized I could never
see a finale any other way.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.893
And what is better than one bride?

12:03.928 --> 12:05.695
- Two brides?
- See?

12:05.730 --> 12:08.063
- But does Darius even know?
- Uh, listen, numbnuts.

12:08.099 --> 12:10.132
You want a seat at the
grownup table or not?

12:10.167 --> 12:13.035
- So badly.
- Then pay attention, okay?

12:13.070 --> 12:15.537
The suitor fake-proposing
to one of these bimbos

12:15.572 --> 12:18.073
might've been interesting
14 seasons ago,

12:18.109 --> 12:20.809
but now we have an
obligation to our viewers.

12:20.844 --> 12:23.778
We have to escalate the
tension, up the stakes,

12:23.814 --> 12:25.580
complicate the story.

12:25.616 --> 12:27.448
- Two brides.
- Right.

12:27.484 --> 12:30.585
Darius is backed into a
corner, he has to pick Tiffany,

12:30.621 --> 12:32.954
leaving Chantal humiliated,

12:32.990 --> 12:35.423
and all in that
beautiful Vera Wang dress,

12:35.458 --> 12:37.726
making it that much more depressing.

12:37.761 --> 12:39.895
Wait, but... But Chantal's my girl.

12:39.930 --> 12:42.596
Ugh. Trust me, you don't
want Tiffany, either.

12:42.632 --> 12:43.861
Why not?

12:44.016 --> 12:48.769
Because once Tiffany is safely
ensconced as Mrs. Darius Beck,

12:48.804 --> 12:54.175
we bring back the storm
of poop that is Yael,

12:54.210 --> 12:56.610
and she reveals that Tiffany

12:56.646 --> 12:59.479
has secretly been sleeping
with the executive producer.

12:59.515 --> 13:01.515
What? Quinn!

13:01.551 --> 13:07.187
It is blood on the floor,
an abattoir ratings bonanza.

13:07.222 --> 13:09.089
- You're incredible.
- Yes. I am.

13:09.124 --> 13:10.925
Chantal does have a dying grandma.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.171
- I could absolutely get her here.
- Oh, see, now we're talking.

13:13.195 --> 13:15.762
- Good job, go, go, go.
- Now we both lose, you little idiot.

13:15.797 --> 13:17.130
Neither of our girls win.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.166
Actually, Darius will
be marrying Tiffany,

13:19.201 --> 13:21.000
so that is a win.

13:21.036 --> 13:23.670
Oh, just relax. I'll give you the bonus.

13:23.705 --> 13:25.372
You two can split it.

13:25.407 --> 13:27.207
So that's it, huh?
This is just what we do

13:27.242 --> 13:30.009
at the end of every season
now, just humiliate the suitor?

13:30.045 --> 13:32.211
Now, that is a show that I would watch.

13:32.246 --> 13:35.114
Can't you see how unfair
this is to Darius, Quinn?

13:35.149 --> 13:37.784
After everything we put him
through, he deserves an ending.

13:37.819 --> 13:40.653
This is an ending...
just not a happy one,

13:40.689 --> 13:43.790
but it's about as real as it gets.

13:50.531 --> 13:51.730
Ooh.

13:51.765 --> 13:53.566
Oh, my God, Chet?

13:53.601 --> 13:55.701
Chet, what are you doing here?

13:55.736 --> 13:58.003
That's not sexy at all.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.638
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.974
I just wanted to drop by and tell you

14:02.009 --> 14:04.910
that, you know, I get it.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.245
You get it?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.849
Wow. Okay.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.051
Okay, well, that... that
makes things really easy.

14:13.087 --> 14:15.487
- Did Quinn talk to you?
- No, she didn't have to.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.489
I know you got to play the game.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.424
Hell, I created the game.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.160
All right, well, uh,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.195
thanks for being so understanding.

14:24.231 --> 14:28.733
Do all the talk shows and get
the covers of all the magazines,

14:28.768 --> 14:32.069
couple of beaucoup endorsements,
make a lot of money,

14:32.105 --> 14:33.583
and then you break off the engagement.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.206
Happens every year.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.842
Um...

14:37.877 --> 14:39.543
Uh, Chet, you know what?

14:39.578 --> 14:41.512
Uh, I have to tell you something.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.514
Um...

14:45.151 --> 14:49.020
You know, Darius doesn't just
want to get engaged tonight,

14:49.055 --> 14:51.722
he wants to get married.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.258
And I'm going to say yes.

14:54.293 --> 14:57.093
Even better. Yeah,
you'll get an annulment.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.062
This thing, we can draw it out forever.

14:59.097 --> 15:00.542
- I mean, that's... that's brilliant.
- No.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.134
No, Chet, I'm going
to marry Darius tonight

15:04.170 --> 15:05.702
for real.

15:05.737 --> 15:09.139
Believe it or not, I love him.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.374
I re... I really am sorry, but, I mean,

15:11.409 --> 15:12.976
when you really think about it, it's...

15:13.011 --> 15:15.444
It's not like we ever
really started anything.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.048
It was ridiculous.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.316
It was really comforting.

15:20.351 --> 15:21.985
- Comforting?
- Yeah.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.154
But we have to end it.

15:24.189 --> 15:27.590
I'm sorry, I... I... I have
to finish getting ready, okay?

15:33.964 --> 15:35.598
Yael's in.

15:35.633 --> 15:38.334
See? You really can do anything.

15:38.369 --> 15:41.571
Oh, my God, it was so easy.
It was textbook narcissist.

15:41.606 --> 15:43.972
You know, I don't really
understand what he sees in her.

15:44.008 --> 15:45.340
Ugh. What are you talking about?

15:45.375 --> 15:47.142
He sees me,

15:47.178 --> 15:53.015
only younger, hotter, less damaged.

15:53.050 --> 15:56.085
Exactly. Not you.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.420
Guy's an idiot.

16:00.123 --> 16:02.324
Now I'm the idiot.

16:03.727 --> 16:06.328
I blew it.

16:06.363 --> 16:08.363
Just like my mom said I would.

16:08.398 --> 16:10.265
What do you mean, like your mom said?

16:10.300 --> 16:11.799
Come on.

16:11.835 --> 16:14.636
Coleman hacked your phone
and tried to put me in jail,

16:14.671 --> 16:18.272
so how did you mess that up?

16:20.643 --> 16:26.013
I just told him all this... this stuff.

16:26.049 --> 16:29.483
You know, like stuff that...

16:29.518 --> 16:31.318
That happened to me when I was a kid.

16:31.354 --> 16:32.553
I...

16:32.588 --> 16:34.855
Okay, life lesson right there.

16:36.726 --> 16:38.459
Yeah.

16:39.562 --> 16:41.862
Screw Coleman.

16:41.897 --> 16:43.564
And screw your mom.

16:43.599 --> 16:46.533
'Cause believe it or not,

16:46.569 --> 16:50.203
all that crap that happened to you

16:50.239 --> 16:52.873
made you exactly who you are.

16:56.178 --> 16:57.878
And you're perfect.

17:25.472 --> 17:27.406
Hey, man, this seat taken?

17:29.476 --> 17:31.677
- Come on, man. Let me buy you a drink.
- No.

17:31.712 --> 17:34.180
- How's it going?
- Uh, back him up.

17:34.215 --> 17:35.915
- For you?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

17:35.950 --> 17:38.950
You want a drink, man, there's
a douche bag bar down the street.

17:38.985 --> 17:40.952
That's funny.

17:40.987 --> 17:42.887
No, seriously.

17:42.923 --> 17:45.190
You ran me out of a job.
What more do you want?

17:45.225 --> 17:47.726
I did you a favor.
"Everlasting" is a hell-hole,

17:47.761 --> 17:50.500
Rachel's a wrecking ball who
leaves nothing but devastation

17:50.501 --> 17:51.996
in her wake.

17:53.133 --> 17:54.933
She dumped you.

17:54.968 --> 17:57.235
That was... That was fast.

17:57.270 --> 17:59.871
Not exactly.

17:59.906 --> 18:03.374
I have a plan. I'm gonna
shut that show down.

18:03.409 --> 18:05.676
You want to help me?

18:10.416 --> 18:12.316
What do you have in mind?

18:16.862 --> 18:22.615
We're getting closer to Darius'
final choice, tonight, live.

18:22.651 --> 18:25.585
Obviously, he has a very
big decision to make,

18:25.620 --> 18:28.788
and we have some big surprises in store.

18:28.823 --> 18:32.158
Oh, you have no idea what
kind of surprises, Graham.

18:32.193 --> 18:34.830
You're going to be excited.
You might even get a hard-on.

18:34.831 --> 18:37.522
But first, let's take a look back
at Tiffany and Chantal's journeys,

18:37.523 --> 18:41.868
two journeys which each
began with one simple step.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.136
Oh, this is going to be so exciting.

18:44.172 --> 18:45.871
Cue the packages.

18:45.906 --> 18:47.518
When are you going to get out the box

18:47.542 --> 18:49.041
and start using your damn legs?

18:49.077 --> 18:50.854
Ugh. The fact that I have
to watch this stuff again

18:50.878 --> 18:52.511
nauseates me.

18:52.547 --> 18:54.213
So we got Chantal's grandma.

18:54.248 --> 18:56.682
- She's in a car, she's on her way.
- Great.

18:56.717 --> 18:59.118
She has no idea what's coming, does she?

18:59.153 --> 19:02.187
Do you ever feel bad about
what we do to these girls?

19:02.222 --> 19:04.322
- Oh, my God!
- Darius, I'm so sorry!

19:04.357 --> 19:06.024
No.

19:06.060 --> 19:08.026
No, we don't. Okay.

19:09.029 --> 19:12.030
Hey, hey, eyes up here.

19:12.066 --> 19:13.999
She's a moron.

19:14.034 --> 19:16.034
- That's a cut.
- That sucked. I... I...

19:16.070 --> 19:17.384
No, it was good.

19:17.385 --> 19:18.681
No, I'm not in the
moment here, just hold on.

19:18.705 --> 19:19.825
No, it was great.
We're going to move on.

19:19.849 --> 19:20.916
I need another take, I'm not feeling it.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.620
- We're not doing another take.
- I saw images of, like, other shit.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.411
Darius?

19:26.446 --> 19:28.713
Hey, how you doing?

19:28.748 --> 19:30.482
Good, no thanks to you.

19:32.085 --> 19:34.719
Okay, uh, well, today is the last day,

19:34.754 --> 19:39.090
so I just wanted to come
over and say that, um...

19:39.125 --> 19:43.427
I was sorry, you know,
about the cops and Romeo.

19:43.462 --> 19:45.062
Should've never listened to you.

19:45.098 --> 19:47.098
When I pulled up in that limo, day one,

19:47.133 --> 19:51.168
I should've seen that do-gooder,
white girl, crazy-eyed look

19:51.203 --> 19:52.702
and run right then.

19:52.738 --> 19:54.824
I would've really loved
to have run with you.

19:54.965 --> 19:56.951
- Now I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No, no, no, no. I just wish that...

19:56.975 --> 20:00.710
You know what I wish? That I
could still be playing football.

20:00.746 --> 20:03.780
Yeah, that I was actually
proposing to a woman

20:03.815 --> 20:07.351
that I love, that I could
have played the game and won.

20:08.887 --> 20:11.354
But I get it.

20:11.389 --> 20:13.356
Yeah, I get it, I get
it. Nothing's real.

20:13.391 --> 20:15.391
It's all a facade.

20:15.426 --> 20:17.694
So I'll play that.

20:20.799 --> 20:22.032
Romeo, hi.

20:22.067 --> 20:23.399
Don't.

20:23.434 --> 20:26.101
You got me shot, so we don't talk again.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.638
Ever. That's how this works.

20:28.673 --> 20:30.640
You ready, D?

20:39.917 --> 20:41.917
How you doing?

20:41.952 --> 20:44.419
Long day, huh?

20:44.454 --> 20:46.321
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:46.356 --> 20:47.756
How did you get in here?

20:47.792 --> 20:49.758
PA doesn't know I was fired.

20:49.794 --> 20:51.226
What's going on?

20:51.261 --> 20:53.428
So Rachel's out, and they
confiscated the footage.

20:53.463 --> 20:55.798
What?! Coleman, how
did you let that happen?

20:55.833 --> 20:58.066
Hold on, it's not over yet,
and that's why we're here.

20:58.101 --> 21:00.168
Yeah, uh, Coleman thought that,

21:00.204 --> 21:02.269
uh, maybe I could use
some media training,

21:02.305 --> 21:03.838
you and I get our stories straight.

21:03.873 --> 21:05.851
When they let you out of here,
I'm taking you and Jeremy,

21:05.875 --> 21:09.610
and my buddy at CNN, we're going to
blow the lid off this thing tonight.

21:09.645 --> 21:11.323
This story coming from you two,
I think, is going to be big.

21:11.347 --> 21:13.514
- Us two?
- I can't go public.

21:13.549 --> 21:16.650
That's a... that's a whole nother
story. Look, we got a couple hours.

21:16.686 --> 21:18.163
I want to prep both of you right
now, make sure we have our...

21:18.187 --> 21:19.953
Wait a minute. We might not need CNN.

21:19.988 --> 21:22.956
They've asked me to appear live tonight.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.359
Wait, how... How'd you finagle this?

21:25.394 --> 21:27.828
I didn't finagle anything.
Rachel just asked me.

21:27.863 --> 21:31.265
She practically begged me. They're
trying to screw over the bride-to-be.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.600
It's so stupid.

21:32.635 --> 21:34.334
Come on, she just got
out of a psych ward.

21:34.369 --> 21:35.869
She's a little crazy.

21:35.904 --> 21:37.270
Rachel was in a mental hospital?

21:37.305 --> 21:39.606
You don't... Oh, yeah.

21:39.641 --> 21:42.042
Okay, so, so, Romeo got
shot, she lost her mind,

21:42.077 --> 21:44.878
she called her mom, her
mom put her in the hospital

21:44.913 --> 21:47.280
and on these drugs.
She was out of her mind.

21:47.315 --> 21:48.659
So when I finally got her out of here,

21:48.683 --> 21:50.061
she thought that was
a good time to tell me

21:50.085 --> 21:51.884
about some crazy childhood rape.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.186
At the hands of one of
her mother's patients.

21:54.222 --> 21:57.156
I mean, with a mother like
that, what do you expect?

21:57.191 --> 22:01.127
Hey, you dodged a bullet
on that one, am I right?

22:01.162 --> 22:04.063
Uh, yeah. Um...

22:04.098 --> 22:07.032
Yeah, I didn't know about that.

22:11.438 --> 22:15.474
Hey, I've been trying
to get you on the walkie.

22:15.509 --> 22:17.676
I turned it off.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.578
What's going on?

22:19.613 --> 22:22.047
I'm just over it. What
are you talking about?

22:22.083 --> 22:23.749
You know I actually let myself believe

22:23.784 --> 22:25.662
we were doing something
good here this season?

22:25.686 --> 22:27.319
With a black suitor?

22:27.354 --> 22:29.988
Now we're straight-up screwing
Darius over and for what?

22:30.023 --> 22:32.090
Half a bonus I have
to split with Madison

22:32.125 --> 22:33.558
and Darius gets nothing.

22:33.594 --> 22:35.327
Not Tiffany, not Chantal,

22:35.362 --> 22:37.329
he can't even play football anymore.

22:37.364 --> 22:39.864
Just another Caucasian
savior making history,

22:39.900 --> 22:41.980
and you're just willing to
blow it up just like that.

22:47.274 --> 22:49.640
So what if there was another way?

22:53.379 --> 22:56.514
This is so exciting.

22:56.549 --> 22:58.716
We're all going to be on live TV?

22:58.751 --> 23:01.752
- Yeah.
- And my Chantal is getting married.

23:01.788 --> 23:03.354
Aw! Look at that.

23:03.389 --> 23:05.523
Her grandma made it, tubes and all.

23:05.558 --> 23:08.459
Who is that old guy in the front row?

23:08.494 --> 23:12.296
That is Tiffany's dad.

23:12.332 --> 23:14.131
If you had more Grey hair,

23:14.166 --> 23:16.300
it'd be like looking in the mirror, huh?

23:18.237 --> 23:21.038
Go ahead, laugh all you
want. Laugh all you want.

23:21.073 --> 23:23.440
You produced Tiffany to marry Darius.

23:23.475 --> 23:25.275
That means you're a little jealous.

23:25.311 --> 23:27.610
You know, not everything
is about you, Chet.

23:27.646 --> 23:30.413
- And yet...
- And yet, not jealous, okay?

23:30.449 --> 23:35.218
Not when I have all of this,
which is about to explode.

23:35.253 --> 23:38.221
Pooh!

23:38.256 --> 23:40.957
Rachel? Rachel?

23:40.992 --> 23:42.905
What... What are you doing here?

23:42.906 --> 23:44.198
- You're not supposed to be here.
- I know. I know.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.105
I'm so sorry. I'm
sorry about everything.

23:45.129 --> 23:46.443
You're sorry for what, beating me up?

23:46.444 --> 23:47.657
- You know you're not supposed to be here.
- Look, I know,

23:47.657 --> 23:48.797
I know. This is important.

23:48.833 --> 23:50.799
- Just hear me out.
- What are you talking about?

23:50.835 --> 23:52.434
I'm sorry. Coleman told me.

23:52.470 --> 23:54.281
- Him and Yael, they...
- Yeah, I know all about them.

23:54.305 --> 23:57.106
No, no, you don't.
She's... She's a reporter.

23:57.141 --> 23:59.775
And she's about to go on live
TV and tell the whole world

23:59.810 --> 24:01.608
that we killed Mary.

24:04.308 --> 24:06.365
I wish to wear my Welsh wristwatch.

24:06.519 --> 24:08.122
She sells seashells
down by the seashore.

24:08.146 --> 24:10.045
A big black bug bit a big black bear

24:10.080 --> 24:13.549
in the a big black butt, and the
big black butt bled black blood.

24:13.584 --> 24:18.120
Okay, so, you know, you
do look absolutely amazing.

24:18.155 --> 24:20.790
Thank you, Madison. You look cute.

24:20.825 --> 24:22.124
Thanks.

24:22.159 --> 24:24.527
So you know what to say, right?

24:24.562 --> 24:25.972
Oh, yeah, I know exactly
what I'm going to say.

24:25.996 --> 24:27.629
So you just wait till they say the vows

24:27.664 --> 24:29.431
and the I do's, and that's our cue.

24:29.466 --> 24:30.765
Yep. All good.

24:30.801 --> 24:32.935
Oh, my God.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.403
I got to do something.

24:34.438 --> 24:36.704
Um, there she is.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.440
All right, Jeremy, you got to go.

24:38.475 --> 24:40.875
No. No. Let me stay.

24:42.446 --> 24:45.046
Okay, just meet me in the
camera truck in five minutes.

24:45.081 --> 24:47.214
All right.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.950
Okay, people, showtime.

24:48.985 --> 24:53.154
Here's my count. Ready? In 3, 2, 1.

24:53.189 --> 24:59.126
Welcome back to "Everlasting,"
where love always finds a way.

24:59.162 --> 25:01.228
We've come to the end
of our journey of love,

25:01.264 --> 25:03.897
These people have no
idea what goes on here,

25:03.933 --> 25:05.599
like what they did to you.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.368
Let's just get what we came for.

25:09.138 --> 25:10.838
- You good?
- I'm good.

25:10.873 --> 25:12.974
I don't have a choice, right?

25:13.009 --> 25:14.408
Not really.

25:14.444 --> 25:16.409
Madison.

25:16.445 --> 25:19.480
Hey, uh, Quinn wants you to
check in on Chantal's grandmother.

25:19.515 --> 25:21.114
Oh, my God, is she suffocating?

25:21.149 --> 25:23.161
Oh, my God, she's having a
really hard time breathing.

25:23.185 --> 25:24.818
No, no, no, no, no.

25:24.854 --> 25:27.253
Tonight is a very special
evening here on "Everlasting,"

25:27.289 --> 25:29.367
not only for our contestants,
but also for me personally.

25:29.391 --> 25:31.824
God, this is not about you.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.594
You are an insignificant turd,

25:34.629 --> 25:37.864
- so come on, let's get on with the show.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

25:37.899 --> 25:41.101
What are you up to, twinsie?

25:41.136 --> 25:44.371
Hey. Uh, I don't know
where I'm supposed to sit.

25:44.406 --> 25:45.938
Oh.

25:45.974 --> 25:47.607
You're a rat.

25:47.642 --> 25:49.008
Excuse me?

25:49.043 --> 25:51.644
You're a sweaty, tabloid hack.

25:51.679 --> 25:53.779
Jeremy sold me out.

25:53.815 --> 25:57.182
Oh, no, he didn't sell. He knows exactly
what you're worth... He gave you away.

25:57.218 --> 25:59.284
Hi, can we get security here, please?

25:59.320 --> 26:01.787
Fine. You can stop me
from being on the show,

26:01.823 --> 26:04.134
but you can't stop me from telling
the world what you people do.

26:04.158 --> 26:05.891
Hi, yeah, can we get
her in a room, please?

26:05.926 --> 26:07.737
Let's lock the door and make
sure no one comes in. Thank you.

26:07.761 --> 26:09.561
You can't shut me up, Rachel.

26:09.596 --> 26:11.830
His decision cannot be any
harder, ladies and gentlemen.

26:11.865 --> 26:13.965
Of course, we have debutante Chantal

26:14.001 --> 26:16.502
or pro-football royalty Tiffany.

26:16.537 --> 26:18.037
Who will Darius choose?

26:18.072 --> 26:20.139
I say we find out, shall we?

26:20.174 --> 26:22.340
Because here he is... Darius Beck.

26:25.211 --> 26:27.646
Ah, here we go.

26:27.681 --> 26:29.247
Where the hell have you been?

26:29.282 --> 26:31.082
Just a couple last-minute issues.

26:31.117 --> 26:33.217
Everything's fine.

26:33.253 --> 26:35.186
Yeah, well, it better be.

26:35.221 --> 26:36.487
Where's Rachel?

26:36.523 --> 26:38.222
I don't know.

26:38.258 --> 26:41.359
But we have to go exclusive
with whoever can get here first.

26:41.394 --> 26:43.661
Uh-huh.

26:43.696 --> 26:46.497
Great. Love it. I'll see you soon.

26:51.037 --> 26:54.337
In an "Everlasting"
surprise, this evening,

26:54.373 --> 26:57.041
we will not be having a proposal...

26:57.076 --> 27:01.579
but instead, with
Darius' special request,

27:01.614 --> 27:03.113
we're going to be having a wedding.

27:03.148 --> 27:04.882
Wait, what?

27:04.917 --> 27:07.785
Surprise! Look at his face.

27:07.820 --> 27:10.087
Remember, you're on live television.

27:10.122 --> 27:11.455
Okay, come on, here we go.

27:11.490 --> 27:13.123
Cue the music, cue the dry ice.

27:13.158 --> 27:14.757
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

27:22.301 --> 27:24.767
Oh! Two brides!

27:24.803 --> 27:26.136
What?!

27:34.312 --> 27:35.544
No.

27:35.580 --> 27:37.213
What are you doing here?

27:37.248 --> 27:38.559
- What are you doing here?
- Chantal!

27:38.583 --> 27:40.750
This is my wedding day.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.085
What do you think this is?

27:42.120 --> 27:43.652
Yes! Yes!

27:43.687 --> 27:45.154
Bride-on-bride cat fight!

27:45.189 --> 27:47.656
Whoo-hoo! This is fantastic.

27:47.691 --> 27:49.669
I was specifically told.
You heard something wrong.

27:49.693 --> 27:51.605
- What? They specifically told me.
- Oh, hold on.

27:51.629 --> 27:52.973
Hey, uh, we have to cut to commercial.

27:52.997 --> 27:54.296
Go to commercial right now.

27:54.332 --> 27:55.897
Okay, that's a cut for commercial.

27:55.933 --> 27:57.466
- Dan! What the heck!
- Great job. Hi.

27:57.502 --> 27:59.435
What is this?

27:59.470 --> 28:01.314
I didn't know, either. I thought
there was only going to be one of you.

28:01.338 --> 28:04.339
Great idea with the curtain! Genius!

28:04.374 --> 28:05.807
Okay. Come on. Let's get this down.

28:05.843 --> 28:08.810
Oh, this is fantastic, you guys.

28:08.846 --> 28:11.479
Oop. Wait, what is that?

28:11.515 --> 28:13.515
Who sidelined my girl?

28:13.550 --> 28:15.450
Where's Rachel?

28:15.485 --> 28:17.352
- Coleman? Hi.
- And then...

28:17.387 --> 28:19.320
Hi. You should just
give it a rest, okay?

28:19.356 --> 28:21.088
Yael's on lockdown.

28:21.124 --> 28:23.458
Well, that is until our reporter
from Entertainment Weekly

28:23.493 --> 28:25.926
- gets here.
- What does that mean?

28:25.962 --> 28:27.529
Uh, it seems that they got wind

28:27.564 --> 28:29.364
of how she lied her way onto the show.

28:29.399 --> 28:32.099
Yeah, yeah, and they're going to
do an article discrediting her,

28:32.135 --> 28:34.113
so from here on end, nobody's
going to believe a word

28:34.137 --> 28:36.203
that comes out of her mouth.

28:36.238 --> 28:38.305
Is that what you think?

28:38.340 --> 28:42.143
No, I don't think. I know.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.211
Okay, you guys look good. Ready?

28:44.246 --> 28:48.382
Okay, we're live in
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Action.

28:48.417 --> 28:49.650
- Darius.
- Darius.

28:49.685 --> 28:51.151
Oh, he's perfect.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.387
Well, the man's an
athlete. He's a quarterback.

28:53.422 --> 28:56.455
What does that have to do
with him being able to smile?

28:56.491 --> 29:00.359
Darius, um, you obviously have
a very big decision to make.

29:00.395 --> 29:03.128
What are you going to do?

29:03.164 --> 29:06.399
Okay. Go ahead. Discredit Yael.

29:06.434 --> 29:09.302
- I'll just come forward myself.
- Oh, really?

29:09.337 --> 29:10.737
I'll admit I faked the documentary.

29:10.771 --> 29:12.470
And why would you do that?

29:12.506 --> 29:15.507
That's mea culpa.

29:15.542 --> 29:17.743
And then who better to
expose the seedy underbelly

29:17.778 --> 29:20.979
of what you do here than someone
who knows exactly how it's done?

29:21.015 --> 29:24.382
Yeah, except that you would never do it,

29:24.418 --> 29:26.719
- because it's too big of a risk.
- Watch me.

29:26.754 --> 29:29.053
I'll burn your empire to the ground.

29:29.089 --> 29:31.356
And you and your fellow sociopaths

29:31.391 --> 29:34.326
will go to jail where you belong.

29:35.596 --> 29:38.363
What was your plan? What
were you going to do?

29:38.398 --> 29:41.065
'Cause you can't keep
Yael past wrap. What then?

29:41.101 --> 29:43.101
'Cause we're actually
going to go to the press

29:43.136 --> 29:44.447
and tell them just how far you'll go

29:44.471 --> 29:47.171
to make really bad television.

29:47.207 --> 29:49.774
And there's not one damn
thing you can do about that.

29:49.809 --> 29:51.609
I win.

29:53.579 --> 29:56.347
Go to your little finale and enjoy it.

29:56.382 --> 29:58.082
It'll be your last one.

30:02.535 --> 30:07.973
We need an answer, Darius,
now on live television.

30:08.009 --> 30:09.875
- Uh...
- What the hell is he doing?

30:09.910 --> 30:11.442
- Uh...
- He looks like a sheep.

30:11.478 --> 30:12.944
It's called a panic attack, Quinn.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.613
Oh, please, okay.

30:14.648 --> 30:17.649
Come on, just pick Tiffany.

30:17.684 --> 30:21.953
I think I need a moment to,
uh, consult with my best man.

30:21.989 --> 30:23.187
Of course.

30:23.223 --> 30:25.657
What's the hold-up?

30:25.692 --> 30:28.526
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- This is some B.S. I'm out of here.

30:28.561 --> 30:30.228
- D, no.
- No, no, no, no.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.529
They want me to get married?

30:31.564 --> 30:33.364
Man, this is not what I signed up for.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.166
Look, we're almost there.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.246
So what I'm going to need for
you to do is make a choice.

30:37.270 --> 30:38.802
I need you to do it now.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.072
... millions of you at home
are watching, praying...

30:41.107 --> 30:43.507
No, no, no no way, this is TV, okay?

30:43.543 --> 30:46.176
Marriage is for real, okay?

30:46.211 --> 30:48.512
- I'm not doing it.
- Look, you can annul later.

30:48.548 --> 30:50.014
Just do it.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.660
We do not want this to
end in a PR disaster.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.361
Look, these girls brought
their families, okay,

30:53.385 --> 30:54.685
so it's real for them, too.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.154
I can't, not if I don't mean it.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.423
Then mean it. Here we go.

30:59.458 --> 31:03.527
With that being said, Darius,
have you made your decision?

31:03.562 --> 31:07.197
Which one of our beautiful
ladies are you going to marry?

31:07.232 --> 31:10.934
We've been on quite a
journey together, haven't we?

31:10.969 --> 31:12.735
Rach.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.337
I can't. But, wait, did you... ?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.738
Ever since the day we started...

31:15.774 --> 31:17.206
Hey, I need you for a second.

31:17.241 --> 31:18.741
- What?
- Come here.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.743
No, I... Jay, take over.

31:20.779 --> 31:22.178
What the?

31:22.213 --> 31:23.858
Look, I tried to stop
them, but Yael and Coleman

31:23.882 --> 31:25.793
are going to the press tonight
as soon as the finale's over.

31:25.817 --> 31:28.095
They're going to take down the
show, Quinn. We're all going to jail.

31:28.119 --> 31:29.564
- And there's nothing that I could do.
- Rachel!

31:29.588 --> 31:31.921
We are in the middle of a live finale,

31:31.957 --> 31:34.457
which I am producing, okay,
so just go and handle it.

31:34.492 --> 31:36.725
- How?
- I don't care, all right.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.629
We said we were going to take
him down, so take him down.

31:40.664 --> 31:42.298
Your dragon. Go.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.467
Two beautiful women...

31:44.502 --> 31:46.302
Uh, hey, Madison?

31:46.337 --> 31:50.553
I need you to go and get
yourself, uh, pretty, okay?

31:50.554 --> 31:51.217
Get camera-ready,

31:51.241 --> 31:53.809
because you are going to drop
the hammer on Tiffany, so go.

31:53.844 --> 31:55.376
Go, go, go, go, go.

31:56.814 --> 31:59.380
Oh, please, get over it!

31:59.416 --> 32:02.651
It's obvious, I know what I have to do,

32:02.686 --> 32:06.221
because when I get married,
it's going to be forever,

32:07.041 --> 32:08.456
- it's going to be real.
- Oh...

32:08.492 --> 32:10.158
I care so much for each one of you...

32:10.193 --> 32:12.927
He's doing it again, you
know, every time with Graham.

32:12.962 --> 32:15.096
Um, I don't think...

32:15.132 --> 32:16.964
Can I help you?

32:17.000 --> 32:18.766
Dan?

32:18.801 --> 32:20.679
I'm gonna get out of here.
Hey, Madison, have a seat.

32:20.703 --> 32:22.937
I know I have decision
that I have to make,

32:22.972 --> 32:26.406
and I'm going to make
the decision right here,

32:26.442 --> 32:28.075
- right now.
- Finally.

32:28.111 --> 32:30.845
So in good conscious,

32:30.880 --> 32:34.214
I just can't marry either one of you.

32:35.785 --> 32:37.952
Ruby?

32:39.488 --> 32:41.821
What the hell is she doing here?

32:52.468 --> 32:54.535
- What is happening?
- What are you doing here?

32:54.570 --> 32:57.270
Are you okay?

32:58.707 --> 33:01.975
Do you know how long it's been
since someone asked me that?

33:02.010 --> 33:04.210
Jay told me you were in trouble.

33:04.245 --> 33:06.646
You might have something
that you want to say to me?

33:06.682 --> 33:09.049
You have no idea.

33:09.084 --> 33:12.518
First I want to say to
you, in front of God,

33:12.554 --> 33:17.022
in front of everybody, um,
I never should've cut you.

33:17.058 --> 33:19.492
It was a huge, huge mistake.

33:19.527 --> 33:21.194
Good for him. Look at that.

33:21.229 --> 33:24.564
Something real is actually
happening on "Everlasting."

33:24.599 --> 33:26.699
Hey, Quinn, do you still want me to...

33:26.734 --> 33:29.735
You've always told the truth, Ruby.

33:29.770 --> 33:32.004
That's what I've always loved about you.

33:32.039 --> 33:34.306
So now it's my turn.

33:36.543 --> 33:38.343
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, hell, no.

33:38.378 --> 33:42.647
Ruby Carter, will you marry me?

33:44.884 --> 33:47.852
Um...

33:49.122 --> 33:50.722
Say yes.

33:50.757 --> 33:53.091
No.

33:53.126 --> 33:55.660
- A wedding? Come on.
- Yes.

33:55.696 --> 33:57.329
Why not?

33:57.364 --> 33:59.075
- We've known each other for nine weeks.
- Okay.

33:59.099 --> 34:00.498
Well, that's crazy.

34:00.534 --> 34:03.034
Come back up here.

34:03.069 --> 34:06.370
What I feel for you,
Darius, that's real.

34:07.807 --> 34:09.373
I love you.

34:10.877 --> 34:12.509
And you know that.

34:12.545 --> 34:15.847
So let's get away from all these cameras

34:15.882 --> 34:18.349
and see what's there,

34:18.384 --> 34:23.085
see what we can have together
for real, just you and me.

34:23.121 --> 34:25.489
Okay?

34:26.925 --> 34:28.559
Come here.

34:40.071 --> 34:43.139
Now, that is true love.

34:43.174 --> 34:47.143
True love...

34:47.178 --> 34:49.311
Who gets that?

34:49.346 --> 34:52.581
Ladies and gentlemen, that's love.

34:58.489 --> 35:01.256
All right, guys, let's...
Let's head outside, okay?

35:01.292 --> 35:03.925
Quinn, are you okay?

35:17.507 --> 35:20.508
Not a chance, man. Show's
over, and we're out.

35:20.543 --> 35:22.010
Hold on. Let me check it out.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.747
Thank you.

35:26.783 --> 35:29.950
- All right, let's roll.
- Yeah.

35:40.062 --> 35:41.595
Hey, hey, Rach.

35:41.631 --> 35:45.766
Hey, so, um, I think you
should just really leave.

35:45.802 --> 35:48.035
I mean, it's over. Yael and Coleman,

35:48.070 --> 35:51.638
they're going to, like,
go to the press tonight.

35:51.673 --> 35:54.341
Okay, and there's like... I...
I... I just don't even know

35:54.376 --> 35:56.643
what we could say to
discredit them at this point.

35:56.678 --> 35:58.278
They're basically like this bomb

35:58.314 --> 36:00.948
that knows every single
thing that we've ever done.

36:00.983 --> 36:02.949
Maybe it's, like, the right thing,

36:02.984 --> 36:05.017
you know, maybe it's for the best?

36:05.053 --> 36:06.386
No.

36:06.421 --> 36:08.888
Or maybe I should
just, like, go to jail.

36:08.923 --> 36:10.490
- Rach.
- I don't know.

36:10.525 --> 36:12.726
I mean, I actually
might, in fact, be crazy.

36:12.761 --> 36:14.661
I mean, crazy people do horrible things,

36:14.696 --> 36:15.995
and I've done horrible things.

36:16.030 --> 36:17.697
I mean, you know that
better than anybody.

36:17.733 --> 36:19.365
- You know.
- I didn't know.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.633
Rach, I didn't know what
happened to you before.

36:21.669 --> 36:26.305
I mean, is that when your
mom started treating you,

36:26.341 --> 36:27.840
'cause of that?

36:27.876 --> 36:30.009
God, how dumb? I just trusted her.

36:30.044 --> 36:31.710
I didn't know. I was just so angry,

36:31.746 --> 36:34.847
and I... I love you so much
and I'd do anything for you.

36:34.883 --> 36:36.749
And I just thought...

36:36.784 --> 36:38.650
Look, I mean, we're
just over, Jeremy, okay?

36:38.686 --> 36:40.318
- You know that.
- It's over.

36:40.354 --> 36:42.488
No way that we're ever
going to come back from that,

36:42.523 --> 36:44.723
and this whole thing
is about to come out.

36:44.759 --> 36:46.525
- I know, I know, I know.
- Okay?

36:46.560 --> 36:48.260
- It's... I mean...
- Just please.

36:48.295 --> 36:50.161
I mean, we could try...

36:50.197 --> 36:52.497
No, we can't, dude! We
are all going to jail!

36:52.532 --> 36:54.065
Do you not get it?

36:54.101 --> 36:57.269
Okay? There is nothing that
anybody can do to stop it!

36:57.304 --> 36:59.871
Oh, my God, this is all my fault.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.360
I mean, how could he do this?

37:14.396 --> 37:15.294
He promised.

37:15.430 --> 37:17.909
It was supposed to be one
of us, either you or me.

37:17.933 --> 37:19.632
Yes, but not her.

37:19.668 --> 37:22.735
And it's like they knew
that he was tricking us.

37:22.770 --> 37:25.638
- Like using us.
- Like using us.

37:25.674 --> 37:28.508
Come here, beautiful.

37:28.543 --> 37:31.611
All right, guys, get ready.

37:33.848 --> 37:35.981
- Good job.
- You, too.

37:36.017 --> 37:38.417
This is what you wanted
for the season, Rach.

37:38.452 --> 37:40.886
It's all me.

37:50.798 --> 37:53.532
There are so few times in your life

37:53.567 --> 37:57.336
when you know you made the right choice,

37:57.371 --> 38:00.372
when you've met that special person

38:00.407 --> 38:03.775
that changes the course of your life

38:03.810 --> 38:07.646
and when regret is a thing of the past.

38:09.049 --> 38:11.116
Oh, "Just Married."

38:11.151 --> 38:13.218
Let's leave it up there for now.

38:13.253 --> 38:15.286
See how it feels.

38:18.291 --> 38:19.891
Congratulations.

38:19.926 --> 38:22.560
They gonna be poor.

38:22.595 --> 38:24.763
They're gonna be happy.

38:24.798 --> 38:27.097
Happy is better.

38:29.068 --> 38:32.936
This is one of those times.

38:35.508 --> 38:37.708
Cut. That's a wrap.

38:39.779 --> 38:42.913
Okay, everyone, let's get
out of here before daylight.

38:42.948 --> 38:45.382
Hey, Rach?

38:45.417 --> 38:47.251
Hmm?

38:47.286 --> 38:48.618
Good job.

39:05.732 --> 39:08.772
I want you to know whatever happens,

39:08.807 --> 39:12.008
you're my family.

39:12.043 --> 39:14.010
I love you.

39:14.045 --> 39:16.445
We'll always have each other.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.315
Yeah. We'll always have that.

39:42.039 --> 39:44.540
Ha-ha. Look at you.

39:44.575 --> 39:48.343
As it turns out, you were
the showrunner, after all.

39:48.378 --> 39:50.345
Uh, Quinn?

39:50.380 --> 39:52.280
No, you nailed it.

39:52.316 --> 39:55.616
Black suitor, black wifey.

39:55.652 --> 39:58.553
It's like a real life fairy tale.

39:58.588 --> 40:01.156
History made.

40:01.191 --> 40:05.192
Look, Quinn, I'm... I'm really sorry.

40:07.330 --> 40:09.597
I tried, but...

40:11.701 --> 40:14.034
So it's over?

40:20.710 --> 40:24.378
Well... it was only a matter of time.

40:24.413 --> 40:27.248
At least we went out with a bang, huh?

40:32.588 --> 40:36.423
Guys, uh, Jeremy has
something to tell you.

40:36.458 --> 40:40.694
Um... you don't ever have
to worry about them again.

40:42.063 --> 40:44.030
I told you I'd do anything.

40:54.742 --> 40:56.876
We have live breaking news at 11:00.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.578
Emergency crews are on the
scene of a single-car accident

40:59.614 --> 41:01.580
at Baywood Canyon Road.

41:01.616 --> 41:04.083
There are no reports yet on
the condition of the occupants.

41:04.119 --> 41:05.805
We will be updating
you with more details

41:05.806 --> 41:08.354
as they become available.
