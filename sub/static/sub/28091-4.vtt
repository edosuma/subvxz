00:00.001 --> 00:01.755
Previously on "When Calls the Heart"...

00:01.780 --> 00:03.351
Mr. Bouchard hired me!

00:03.376 --> 00:05.345
The sooner we take care
of our money problem,

00:05.370 --> 00:07.364
the sooner we can start
our life together.

00:07.389 --> 00:08.496
One thing I miss about the city?

00:08.521 --> 00:11.054
The postal service delivers
packages right to your door.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.211
If you see Mr. Bouchard,

00:12.236 --> 00:13.328
can you tell him that
his trunk arrived?

00:13.353 --> 00:14.218
<i>What is it?</i>

00:14.243 --> 00:15.898
<i>Just a nice trunk. Wouldn't ya say?</i>

00:15.923 --> 00:18.390
<i>There's something about this
guy that doesn't sit right.</i>

00:18.626 --> 00:20.810
Nobody means more to me than you do.

00:20.835 --> 00:24.245
Yes, to the possibility of you and me!

00:30.220 --> 00:32.735
<i>We never know how life will turn...</i>

00:33.359 --> 00:35.303
<i>It's been a week since Abigail got word</i>

00:35.328 --> 00:37.960
<i>that her mother had
taken ill back East.</i>

00:38.421 --> 00:40.222
<i>True to her nature,</i>

00:40.247 --> 00:43.826
<i>Abigail wasted no time in
rushing off to care for her.</i>

00:45.095 --> 00:47.887
<i>Abigail is much more than a friend.</i>

00:48.364 --> 00:50.029
<i>She's family...</i>

00:50.167 --> 00:52.876
<i>and I'll miss her and Cody deeply.</i>

00:53.539 --> 00:57.749
<i>We all will, but we must
get by as best we can...</i>

00:59.218 --> 01:01.592
<i>Bill has taken over some
of the responsibilities</i>

01:01.617 --> 01:03.156
<i>in the cafe.</i>

01:03.515 --> 01:08.511
<i>Clara, as busy as she is, has
agreed to help out when she can.</i>

01:09.388 --> 01:12.998
<i>We all keep Abigail and
her family in our prayers</i>

01:13.023 --> 01:15.117
<i>and wish her Godspeed.</i>

01:16.863 --> 01:21.523
<i>In her absence, we must
soldier on, and we will.</i>

01:22.043 --> 01:23.820
<i>We are a community.</i>

01:23.845 --> 01:25.444
<i>We are strong.</i>

01:26.338 --> 01:28.269
<i>We are Hope Valley.</i>

01:41.548 --> 01:43.500
A full boat, gentlemen.

01:43.524 --> 01:45.254
And the rich get richer.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.469
Yes, they do.

01:48.718 --> 01:50.851
I got your drink there.

02:01.016 --> 02:02.312
Let's take a look at the aces.

02:02.337 --> 02:03.218
'Kay.

02:03.243 --> 02:07.588
I need you to hang onto
the Ace of Diamonds

02:08.457 --> 02:10.814
and the Ace of Hearts.

02:13.147 --> 02:14.681
Just tell me which one is on top.

02:14.706 --> 02:16.464
The Ace of Hearts.

02:16.489 --> 02:18.856
That makes no sense, because
I have it right here.

02:21.511 --> 02:22.610
Well, I'm impressed.

02:22.635 --> 02:23.770
Thank you.

02:23.795 --> 02:24.694
We aim to please.

02:24.719 --> 02:26.284
Oh! Do another one.

02:26.309 --> 02:28.504
Well, I'd have to use the
help of my lovely assistant.

02:28.529 --> 02:30.106
Oh! I don't know.

02:30.131 --> 02:31.763
I sense you have the gift of magic.

02:32.022 --> 02:33.855
Let me see your hand.

02:35.969 --> 02:38.101
As you can see, nothing here.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.771
Nothing here.

02:40.937 --> 02:42.069
Hey, hey, hey!

02:42.094 --> 02:43.524
What're you doing, get
your hands off her!

02:43.549 --> 02:45.475
Jesse! It was just a card trick!

02:45.688 --> 02:47.054
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

02:47.210 --> 02:48.813
What, do you think this is funny?

02:48.838 --> 02:50.572
Well, I'm not gonna lie. I am amused!

02:50.597 --> 02:52.980
Let's break it up.

02:54.351 --> 02:56.914
Hey, hey, hey!

02:57.454 --> 02:58.486
Get up! Get movin'!

02:58.525 --> 02:59.358
I can explain.

02:59.393 --> 03:02.078
Come on! Come on, let's move.

03:02.103 --> 03:03.258
Come on.

03:04.466 --> 03:05.799
Clara!

03:09.355 --> 03:10.821
Well, that's not the
type of entertainment

03:10.846 --> 03:12.746
I was aiming for, but...

03:13.060 --> 03:14.405
drinks are on the house!

03:18.639 --> 03:20.624
If you'll let me explain.

03:20.853 --> 03:22.363
You, over there.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.164
Get in there.

03:24.523 --> 03:25.856
What was that about?

03:25.891 --> 03:26.968
Come on, Bill.

03:26.993 --> 03:28.158
You don't like Bouchard, either.

03:28.193 --> 03:28.806
So?

03:28.831 --> 03:32.007
Doesn't mean I start swinging
at everybody, even Bouchard.

03:33.065 --> 03:34.197
Sorry.

03:34.233 --> 03:35.799
That punch wasn't meant for you.

03:35.835 --> 03:37.939
I'm not sure where you're from,
but around here in Hope Valley,

03:37.964 --> 03:40.014
we don't take kindly to barroom brawls.

03:40.039 --> 03:41.009
And neither do I.

03:41.034 --> 03:42.049
Well, you coulda fooled me.

03:42.074 --> 03:43.874
I was trying to stop the fight.

03:43.910 --> 03:45.126
Well, how'd that work?

03:45.151 --> 03:46.939
From now on, you just
mind your own business.

03:46.964 --> 03:48.681
You leave the law and order to me.

03:48.977 --> 03:51.243
Yeah, I... can't do that.

03:51.268 --> 03:52.523
Why is that?

03:53.025 --> 03:54.895
Because I'm your new Mountie.

03:55.606 --> 03:57.505

04:31.467 --> 04:35.419
Here we go... oh woosh!

04:35.689 --> 04:38.734
Oh, it's so good, isn't it?

04:42.228 --> 04:43.833
What assignment are you
working on, Laura?

04:43.858 --> 04:45.716
It's for my Philosophy class.

04:45.748 --> 04:47.680
"What does it mean to
have a good life?"

04:47.817 --> 04:48.983
Huh.

04:49.008 --> 04:50.541
What does it mean for you?

04:50.745 --> 04:54.834
Aristotle believed that a
good life was a happy life.

04:55.260 --> 04:57.327
And this little man makes
me happy every day,

04:57.352 --> 04:59.291
so I'm gonna go with that.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.630
I'd better get to school.

05:05.196 --> 05:07.444
There we go.

05:09.086 --> 05:12.031
All right. I'll see you two later.

05:12.056 --> 05:13.472
Do you want to play with the bear?

05:13.497 --> 05:15.048
Do you want to play with the bear?

05:15.073 --> 05:16.678
Do you wanna play with the bear?

05:18.119 --> 05:19.251
Was that a...

05:19.276 --> 05:20.630
It was!

05:20.655 --> 05:21.707
Oh!

05:21.732 --> 05:23.200
Baby's first giggle!

05:23.225 --> 05:24.205
Oh!

05:24.230 --> 05:26.148
Can you do it again for Mommy?

05:26.790 --> 05:27.956
What were you doing?

05:27.981 --> 05:29.534
Just playing with the bear.

05:30.093 --> 05:32.010
Look at the very silly bear.

05:32.035 --> 05:35.794
He's going to get his
honey, and he's so sweet!

05:35.963 --> 05:38.021
Yes, he's so sweet!

05:39.322 --> 05:41.397
Maybe it was just gas.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.096
All right.

05:45.525 --> 05:47.066
You two have a good day.

05:51.711 --> 05:53.585
I love that giggle!

06:25.241 --> 06:27.105
Coulda told me you were a Mountie.

06:27.411 --> 06:29.145
Would that have changed anything?

06:29.509 --> 06:32.702
Nevertheless, my sincere apologies.

06:32.782 --> 06:34.626
I'd like to do something
to make amends.

06:34.651 --> 06:35.901
That's not necessary.

06:35.926 --> 06:36.791
Nonsense!

06:36.827 --> 06:38.660
Dinner tonight is on the house.

06:49.955 --> 06:51.321
What is that sound?

06:51.451 --> 06:52.679
Oh, I don't hear anything.

06:52.915 --> 06:54.419
What do you mean, "you
don't hear anything?"

06:54.444 --> 06:56.243
Something is ringing.

06:56.268 --> 06:57.742
Oh, Lee, I've heard about this.

06:57.767 --> 06:58.587
Ringing in the ears.

06:58.612 --> 07:00.078
It's a sign of hearing loss.

07:00.103 --> 07:01.681
Perhaps... it's from the sawmill?

07:01.706 --> 07:02.871
Rosemary...

07:06.001 --> 07:07.190
Hello.

07:07.215 --> 07:08.837
<i>Mrs. Coulter please.</i>

07:08.862 --> 07:10.328
It's for you.

07:11.954 --> 07:12.759
Hello?

07:12.784 --> 07:13.400
<i>Rosemary.</i>

07:13.425 --> 07:14.680
- Fiona.
- <i>The fight last night.</i>

07:14.705 --> 07:15.930
Yes, really?

07:15.955 --> 07:17.044
<i>Oh, it was crazy.</i>

07:17.069 --> 07:17.876
<i>I couldn't believe...</i>

07:17.901 --> 07:19.157
I can't really talk right now.

07:19.182 --> 07:19.948
<i>Oh...</i>

07:20.047 --> 07:21.378
I'll call you back later.

07:21.403 --> 07:22.426
<i>Ok.</i>

07:22.729 --> 07:24.750
Now, Lee, before you get upset;

07:24.775 --> 07:26.031
I was going to tell you.

07:26.056 --> 07:27.373
- I'm not upset.
- You're not?

07:27.398 --> 07:28.838
No. Because you are
gonna get rid of that.

07:28.863 --> 07:29.940
I most certainly am not.

07:29.965 --> 07:30.818
Oh, yes you are.

07:30.843 --> 07:31.776
I have one of these at the office;

07:31.801 --> 07:33.239
I do not need one in my house.

07:33.264 --> 07:34.663
Lee Coulter, this isn't about you.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.309
What if Elizabeth has an emergency

07:36.334 --> 07:37.966
with little baby Jack and
she needs to come over here

07:37.991 --> 07:39.257
and call for help?

07:39.282 --> 07:40.492
Or what if there's a plague?

07:40.517 --> 07:43.103
And you need to call me
and warn me to stay away?

07:43.487 --> 07:46.111
I'm sorry, did you just say "plague?"

07:46.208 --> 07:47.707
You can never be too prepared.

07:47.954 --> 07:49.854
Besides, may I remind you,

07:49.879 --> 07:51.220
you said we could get a phone.

07:51.245 --> 07:52.728
No, I said "we'll see."

07:52.753 --> 07:55.221
And, as you see, it's here.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.460
What happened with Carson?

08:18.485 --> 08:20.552
<i>Rosemary! Good morning!</i>

08:20.577 --> 08:21.772
Uh, Carson!

08:21.797 --> 08:22.694
What brings you by?

08:22.719 --> 08:25.106
I am so glad you're here.

08:25.131 --> 08:26.263
I'm in so much pain.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.291
Have a seat, we'll take a look at it.

08:30.721 --> 08:32.673
Now, what seems to be the problem?

08:32.698 --> 08:36.500
Silly me, I was walking
along, and then I just fell.

08:36.705 --> 08:38.399
Weren't you holding the other hand?

08:38.592 --> 08:39.693
Both.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.400
Both hurt.

08:41.424 --> 08:43.024
Ah. Let me see.

08:43.097 --> 08:45.053
Ok. Can you close 'em?

08:45.096 --> 08:46.100
Can you open 'em?

08:46.125 --> 08:47.073
Ah.

08:47.098 --> 08:49.692
Probably not broken.
Might be just a sprain.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.026
Can you wrap these for me please?

08:51.051 --> 08:52.017
Of course, Doctor.

08:52.042 --> 08:53.527
If you have any more pain,

08:53.552 --> 08:55.304
you come back and see me, okay?

08:55.329 --> 08:56.186
Absolutely.

08:56.211 --> 08:57.510
Okay.

09:02.736 --> 09:04.235
So?

09:04.422 --> 09:05.387
We talked.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.545
And?

09:06.635 --> 09:08.498
Decided it would be
best to remain friends.

09:08.523 --> 09:09.689
What?

09:09.758 --> 09:10.744
Why on earth?

09:10.769 --> 09:12.368
We work together; it's
just too complicated

09:12.393 --> 09:14.129
and not worth the trouble.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.407
Now, you listen to me, Faith Carter.

09:16.432 --> 09:19.100
Love is always worth the trouble!

09:19.125 --> 09:21.088
Nobody said anything about love.

09:21.471 --> 09:22.830
Perhaps.

09:23.092 --> 09:25.545
But I've seen the way you
two look at each other.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.489
Mark my words, it's love.

09:28.514 --> 09:30.410
Rosemary; it's best this way.

09:30.586 --> 09:32.119
For whom?

09:41.414 --> 09:42.886
I hate lying to her.

09:42.911 --> 09:44.211
We're not lying.

09:44.236 --> 09:46.229
We're just not telling anyone yet.

09:46.705 --> 09:48.744
I appreciate how excited she is for us,

09:48.769 --> 09:51.217
and I know the rest of the
town will be, as well.

09:51.412 --> 09:52.722
But?

09:53.015 --> 09:54.257
But...

09:54.968 --> 09:57.527
I'm not ready for everyone's opinion.

09:57.977 --> 10:01.828
I wanna feel what I feel,
with no outside interference.

10:01.961 --> 10:03.311
Does that make sense?

10:03.336 --> 10:05.059
It makes perfect sense.

10:14.843 --> 10:16.602
<i>We were robbed!</i>

10:17.943 --> 10:19.476
Everyone, this way, this way.

10:19.501 --> 10:20.619
Stay off the road!

10:21.489 --> 10:22.944
<i>We were robbed!</i>

10:28.050 --> 10:29.921
Woah, woah, woah, woah!

10:29.946 --> 10:32.906
Sheriff, we were robbed. Whoa.

10:33.952 --> 10:36.061
We could have been killed.
There's a gang.

10:36.086 --> 10:38.882
All right. Just, calm down
and give me the details.

10:38.907 --> 10:41.030
Anything you could remember.

10:46.060 --> 10:48.127
They stole your payroll.

10:48.217 --> 10:49.216
Where?

10:49.241 --> 10:51.209
On the bridge in Snake Run Canyon.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.401
My wheel got stuck and
they hit us there.

10:53.426 --> 10:54.612
How many men were there?

10:54.637 --> 10:55.670
Five.

10:57.348 --> 10:58.485
Do you get a good look?

10:58.510 --> 10:59.578
Their faces were covered.

10:59.603 --> 11:00.697
I'm sorry, Mr. Coulter.

11:00.722 --> 11:02.519
They threatened to kill me if I
didn't turn over the payroll.

11:02.544 --> 11:03.973
It's all right, you
did the right thing.

11:03.998 --> 11:06.030
You think you can handle this
while I talk to witnesses?

11:06.055 --> 11:07.634
How do I get to Snakerun Canyon?

11:07.659 --> 11:08.819
Oh, I can take you there.

11:08.844 --> 11:10.330
This is too dangerous for a civilian.

11:10.355 --> 11:12.603
I'm sure the robbers
are long gone by now.

11:12.897 --> 11:13.963
Okay?

11:13.988 --> 11:15.320
Let's go.

11:17.179 --> 11:18.981
Elizabeth...

11:19.448 --> 11:21.289
Wow, a robbery.

11:21.325 --> 11:23.046
Are you okay?

11:23.335 --> 11:24.733
I'm fine.

11:24.758 --> 11:26.392
Are you sure?

11:26.522 --> 11:29.079
We knew a Mountie would be assigned
to Hope Valley eventually.

11:29.104 --> 11:31.692
I'm alright, really.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.177
I'm on a tight schedule.

11:35.202 --> 11:37.202
I need to gather these
ladies and be on my way.

11:37.227 --> 11:39.771
You're not going anywhere on that axle.

11:41.572 --> 11:42.815
Take this down to the blacksmith.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.250
See what he can do.

11:44.275 --> 11:45.763
All right.

11:53.444 --> 11:56.560
<i>When debating, only one
person may speak at a time,</i>

11:56.585 --> 11:58.941
and each side will have
an equal amount of time

11:58.966 --> 12:01.411
to present their opening arguments.

12:01.436 --> 12:02.815
Any questions?

12:02.975 --> 12:04.009
Yes, Opal?

12:04.034 --> 12:05.191
Can we use our notes?

12:05.216 --> 12:07.081
You may only glance down
to refer to your notes;

12:07.106 --> 12:08.319
no reading them out loud.

12:08.344 --> 12:09.388
Understood?

12:09.413 --> 12:10.218
Yes, Opal?

12:10.243 --> 12:11.209
What if I forget?

12:11.234 --> 12:12.567
Well, did you practice?

12:12.736 --> 12:15.399
Then I have no doubt you're
going to do just fine.

12:15.722 --> 12:19.315
Now, perhaps the most important
thing about any debate,

12:19.340 --> 12:21.592
is to be respectful of your opponent.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.119
Understood?

12:23.144 --> 12:25.769
Now, Anna and Emily, would
you please start us off?

12:25.950 --> 12:28.772
You will each have two minutes
to give your opening statement;

12:28.797 --> 12:31.030
then we will move on to rebuttal.

12:31.270 --> 12:32.637
Ready?

12:32.662 --> 12:33.794
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.384
Emily? Please begin.

12:35.441 --> 12:37.683
I will use three points
to support my argument:

12:37.708 --> 12:39.224
Cars are better than horses.

12:39.249 --> 12:41.415
<i>First, cars can carry four people,</i>

12:41.440 --> 12:44.654
<i>and horses can only carry
two, and sometimes only one,</i>

12:44.679 --> 12:46.083
depending on the size.

12:46.288 --> 12:49.872
Second, cars can travel
up to 150 miles per day.

12:50.054 --> 12:52.679
But, horses can only
travel 30 miles per day.

12:52.704 --> 12:55.326
And lastly, cars smell
much better than horses,

12:55.351 --> 12:58.381
because they don't leave 40
pounds of manure on our roads.

12:58.406 --> 13:00.177
<i>Eww!</i>

13:00.202 --> 13:01.619
But it's a part of nature.

13:01.644 --> 13:04.543
That is a very good point,
Anna, but it is not your turn.

13:08.292 --> 13:09.702
<i>Clara!</i>

13:11.788 --> 13:13.013
Clara!

13:15.099 --> 13:16.498
Hey, Clara!

13:16.523 --> 13:18.028
Do you hear me calling?

13:18.368 --> 13:19.969
Why are you mad?

13:20.205 --> 13:23.324
Let's start with how you made
a complete fool of yourself.

13:23.404 --> 13:26.384
Or perhaps I'm mad because
you took a swing at my boss.

13:26.409 --> 13:28.694
Or, could it be because
you were thrown in jail?

13:28.948 --> 13:31.135
Bill only locked me up for an hour.

13:31.425 --> 13:32.667
Come on, Clara.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.024
I was only trying to protect you.

13:34.049 --> 13:35.416
From a card trick?

13:35.454 --> 13:36.922
Bouchard kissed your hand.

13:36.947 --> 13:38.858
No, Jesse, he didn't.

13:38.883 --> 13:41.832
And do you really think I would
be fine with it if he had?

13:42.486 --> 13:45.300
I love you, but you have got
to get over this jealousy

13:45.325 --> 13:46.158
and trust me.

13:46.203 --> 13:47.836
I do trust you.

13:48.092 --> 13:49.491
It's Bouchard I don't trust.

13:49.516 --> 13:51.055
I'm sorry you feel that way.

13:51.404 --> 13:52.570
Then...

13:52.724 --> 13:54.156
you'll quit?

13:54.398 --> 13:55.497
Jesse.

13:55.565 --> 13:57.436
This is your problem.

13:57.816 --> 13:59.697
What does that mean?

14:00.154 --> 14:02.111
I have to get to work.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.217
I don't understand women.

14:14.242 --> 14:15.461
Something on your mind?

14:15.486 --> 14:17.186
They say they want a strong
man to protect them,

14:17.211 --> 14:20.342
but the moment you do, you get
accused of being jealous.

14:21.552 --> 14:23.378
Is this about last night?

14:23.403 --> 14:24.984
See, I'd have to agree
with the young lady.

14:25.009 --> 14:27.976
It was not your finest hour.

14:28.358 --> 14:30.203
Well, now she won't even speak to me.

14:30.906 --> 14:32.111
What would you do?

14:32.136 --> 14:34.591
Well, I think you're
asking the wrong fellow.

14:34.616 --> 14:37.894
All this life has taught
me is how to lose women,

14:37.926 --> 14:40.349
and you seem to be doing a
fairly good job of that

14:40.374 --> 14:42.184
all on your own.

14:50.948 --> 14:52.583
Ladies?

14:53.294 --> 14:54.549
I'm Sheriff Avery.

14:54.584 --> 14:55.786
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

14:55.811 --> 14:56.995
Of course.

14:57.020 --> 14:58.386
My heart is still racing.

14:58.422 --> 15:00.488
I swear, I have never been so scared.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.380
Well, that's understandable.

15:03.058 --> 15:05.621
So, why don't you tell
me what happened?

15:06.251 --> 15:07.750
When the stagecoach wheel got stuck,

15:07.775 --> 15:09.282
we went for a walk.

15:09.307 --> 15:10.606
Are you two travelling together?

15:10.642 --> 15:12.475
- No.
- No, no, we just met.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.610
But thank heaven for
her, she saved my life!

15:14.646 --> 15:15.637
Oh, don't be silly.

15:15.662 --> 15:16.739
Well, no, if it wasn't for you,

15:16.764 --> 15:19.101
I would have stayed in the stagecoach!

15:19.126 --> 15:20.461
I have on the absolute worst shoes

15:20.486 --> 15:21.845
for wandering about in the woods.

15:21.870 --> 15:24.451
I just, I wore them because
they matched my hat.

15:24.476 --> 15:25.536
Your hat?

15:25.561 --> 15:27.393
I lost it by the trees
when we heard the gunfire.

15:27.418 --> 15:28.550
Hmm.

15:28.913 --> 15:30.045
Did you see anything?

15:30.070 --> 15:30.802
No.

15:30.827 --> 15:31.489
I did.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.644
I saw five men, all
masked, carrying rifles.

15:34.669 --> 15:35.930
Oh, I told her to hide with me,

15:35.955 --> 15:37.808
but she insisted on keeping an eye out.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.263
I wasn't about to let
anyone sneak up on us.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.632
And fortunately, they didn't see you.

15:42.657 --> 15:43.836
There's no way they could have;

15:43.861 --> 15:47.317
I was crouched down and
hidden the entire time.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.040
Yeah, I know Jesse can
get a little riled up

15:51.065 --> 15:54.268
from time to time, but he's
still a pretty good kid.

15:54.633 --> 15:56.533
My jaw begs to differ.

15:56.558 --> 15:57.824
I guess it would.

15:57.936 --> 15:59.469
You know, Hope Valley's a good town.

15:59.504 --> 16:00.669
Great people.

16:00.705 --> 16:02.204
Extremely safe.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.608
This is the first stagecoach
robbery since I've been here.

16:04.633 --> 16:07.810
A couple guys, outlaws, came to town
one time, and tried to rob the bank.

16:07.835 --> 16:10.295
But other than that, extremely safe.

16:11.014 --> 16:13.180
You don't really talk much, do ya?

16:13.542 --> 16:14.941
Uh, no, sorry.

16:14.966 --> 16:16.662
No, no, no, it's fine.

16:16.687 --> 16:18.551
You been to this area before?

16:18.677 --> 16:19.744
Nope.

16:19.769 --> 16:22.329
I got some maps I can lend you.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.025
Appreciate that. Thank you.

16:24.061 --> 16:26.513
You know, last Mountie we had
was a good friend of mine.

16:26.936 --> 16:28.236
Woah.

16:28.261 --> 16:29.825
Yeah, I take it he had a
lot of friends in town.

16:29.850 --> 16:30.725
Yeah.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.483
Yeah, he did.

16:31.508 --> 16:32.507
Did you know Jack?

16:32.532 --> 16:33.407
No.

16:33.432 --> 16:34.964
Never had the pleasure.

16:35.115 --> 16:36.855
He was a good man.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.213
Yeah.

16:38.238 --> 16:40.958
You know, the Mounties consider
him one of our finest.

16:41.965 --> 16:44.567
So, what do you want me to do?

16:44.998 --> 16:46.735
I'll take it from here.

16:49.335 --> 16:52.832
Well, considering it was my
payroll that was stolen,

16:52.857 --> 16:55.068
I think I'm gonna help out.

17:29.143 --> 17:30.999
Found the payroll box!

17:31.179 --> 17:32.829
All right. Hold on.

17:32.854 --> 17:34.654
I'm coming.

17:39.953 --> 17:41.442
Oh!

17:42.559 --> 17:44.826
I'll have to get my pants cleaned.

17:54.835 --> 17:56.435
Any idea which way they went?

17:56.470 --> 17:57.602
No.

17:57.638 --> 17:59.955
No, these roads are too well-traveled.

18:01.388 --> 18:02.873
Alright.

18:06.179 --> 18:08.339
Cars are only used for transportation.

18:08.364 --> 18:10.231
Horses are used for so much more.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.357
Anything a horse can do,
a car can do better.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.415
And much faster!

18:13.440 --> 18:15.169
A car's just some kind of contraption.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.302
A horse is a friend!

18:16.327 --> 18:17.673
A loud, stinky friend.

18:17.698 --> 18:19.974
Removing horses from our city
would help reduce noise.

18:19.999 --> 18:20.868
You're wrong!

18:20.893 --> 18:22.583
Everybody knows cars make
more noise than horses.

18:22.608 --> 18:24.792
Anna, don't make it personal.

18:25.554 --> 18:27.119
Horses are able to go
places cars can't,

18:27.144 --> 18:28.376
like through a river.

18:28.401 --> 18:29.534
Ever heard of a bridge?

18:29.559 --> 18:31.725
Emily! Lose the sarcasm.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.167
Horses are self-feeding,
and can reproduce.

18:34.192 --> 18:36.493
They're far more
economical than any car.

18:36.518 --> 18:37.984
They have to have hay and apples.

18:38.009 --> 18:39.569
Do you think they pick
their own apples?

18:39.594 --> 18:40.505
They could if they wanted to!

18:40.530 --> 18:41.463
How would you know?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.220
Girls, that's enough.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.971
After lunch, we'll pick
back up with Opal and Ruby.

18:48.403 --> 18:51.244
You two please stay, everyone
else is excused for lunch.

18:56.919 --> 18:58.886
Anna, Emily...

19:04.005 --> 19:05.005
Girls.

19:05.030 --> 19:07.624
Do you two understand why
I stopped your debate?

19:07.649 --> 19:09.167
Because Anna was losing?

19:09.192 --> 19:10.125
Was not!

19:10.150 --> 19:11.789
This is not about losing.

19:11.814 --> 19:13.083
This is about listening

19:13.108 --> 19:15.867
to the other person's point
of view with respect.

19:16.231 --> 19:18.503
Do you understand?

19:30.366 --> 19:31.755
Yes, Mrs. Coulter?

19:31.780 --> 19:32.612
<i>Fiona.</i>

19:32.637 --> 19:34.037
Have you met the new Mountie?

19:34.062 --> 19:36.896
Not yet, but I hear he's quite a dish.

19:37.181 --> 19:38.169
Of what?

19:39.433 --> 19:41.666
Mrs. Coulter, you are a dilly.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.214
Could you just connect me
with my husband please.

19:45.249 --> 19:46.949
<i>Oh? You haven't heard?</i>

19:47.017 --> 19:47.850
Heard what?

19:47.885 --> 19:49.318
The stagecoach was robbed.

19:49.343 --> 19:50.900
They took your husband's payroll.

19:50.925 --> 19:52.324
<i>Mr. Coulter left with the new Mountie</i>

19:52.349 --> 19:53.548
<i>to go check it out.</i>

19:53.605 --> 19:55.154
He did what?

20:17.376 --> 20:19.850
Robert said we have a new Mountie.

20:19.877 --> 20:21.110
That's true.

20:21.135 --> 20:22.710
I... I saw him earlier.

20:22.781 --> 20:25.115
Do you think he's as
brave as Mountie Jack?

20:25.380 --> 20:27.189
I'm sure he's very brave.

20:27.214 --> 20:28.746
But not as brave?

20:28.811 --> 20:31.749
No one will ever be as
brave as Mountie Jack.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.615
Thank you.

20:42.106 --> 20:43.411
I appreciate the help.

20:43.436 --> 20:45.006
Oh, no problem.

20:45.031 --> 20:46.850
It's my payroll, after all.

20:47.378 --> 20:51.013
Man, this creek mud gets
all over everything.

20:51.261 --> 20:52.726
Tracked it in my house one time.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.910
My wife wasn't very happy about that.

20:55.502 --> 20:58.125
You know, you really don't
say very much, do you?

20:58.744 --> 21:00.711
Not unless there's
something to be said.

21:03.824 --> 21:05.876
Lee Coulter's office.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.140
Oh. Wait, I see him!

21:09.165 --> 21:10.583
Put her through.

21:13.001 --> 21:14.301
Mr. Coulter?

21:14.430 --> 21:16.217
Your wife's on the phone,
she says it's urgent.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.318
Oh, alright.

21:23.439 --> 21:24.452
Rosemary?

21:24.477 --> 21:27.100
<i>What were you thinking, running
off to chase bandits!?</i>

21:27.125 --> 21:28.889
Sweetheart, calm down.

21:28.914 --> 21:31.459
Don't you dare tell me to
calm down, Lee Coulter.

21:31.484 --> 21:33.458
I have been worried sick!

21:33.483 --> 21:34.380
Okay. You're right.

21:34.405 --> 21:35.710
You're right. I'm sorry.

21:35.735 --> 21:37.501
I should have told you.

21:37.766 --> 21:38.767
Well, yes.

21:38.792 --> 21:39.938
You very much should have.

21:39.963 --> 21:41.813
<i>I was never in any danger, all right?</i>

21:41.838 --> 21:44.526
The bad guys were gone
long before I got there.

21:44.551 --> 21:45.487
Oh.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.789
Well, good.

21:46.814 --> 21:48.514
So have you met the new Mountie?

21:48.539 --> 21:49.721
Uh...

21:49.746 --> 21:50.617
I met him.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.099
Yes, I met him.

21:52.917 --> 21:53.915
And?

21:53.940 --> 21:55.039
What's he like?

21:55.064 --> 21:55.829
I, well, listen...

21:55.854 --> 21:57.754
Can we discuss this tonight?

21:57.779 --> 22:00.133
Why does no one want
to tell me about him?

22:00.158 --> 22:01.057
Tonight. I promise.

22:01.082 --> 22:02.155
Tonight.

22:03.899 --> 22:04.996
Hello?

22:05.021 --> 22:06.454
Okay?

22:36.810 --> 22:38.979
How much longer are you
planning on being here?

22:39.004 --> 22:40.736
Well, apparently nobody told you.

22:40.761 --> 22:43.017
I come with the office.

22:44.428 --> 22:46.266
So, how does this work?

22:47.986 --> 22:50.089
I'll deal with local issues,
you handle regional ones.

22:50.114 --> 22:51.913
Anything big, we work together.

22:53.836 --> 22:56.245
<i>I called Mountie offices in
Benson Hills and in Buckson,</i>

22:56.270 --> 22:57.559
<i>and made them alert.</i>

22:57.584 --> 22:58.819
Now what did you find?

23:00.797 --> 23:02.990
Seven rifle shells.

23:06.145 --> 23:07.586
They all 308s?

23:07.611 --> 23:08.646
Yep.

23:08.671 --> 23:09.978
Any other type?

23:11.304 --> 23:13.014
The bridge was tampered with.

23:13.182 --> 23:15.255
I also found the empty payroll box.

23:16.284 --> 23:17.906
They left the box?

23:19.044 --> 23:20.430
What?

23:20.467 --> 23:22.033
We're missing something.

23:25.182 --> 23:27.323
In conclusion, I think
you'll agree that lasagna

23:27.348 --> 23:29.111
is the better choice.

23:29.136 --> 23:31.342
Not only are the noodles
wider than spaghetti;

23:31.367 --> 23:34.444
in addition to tomato sauce,
you get tons of cheese.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.413
And who doesn't like cheese?

23:40.111 --> 23:41.597
Well done, Harper and Robert.

23:41.622 --> 23:43.796
You both made excellent arguments.

23:44.483 --> 23:45.784
Wanna come over for dinner?

23:45.809 --> 23:47.631
Sure. Would your Mom make lasagna?

23:47.656 --> 23:49.304
We can always ask.

23:49.329 --> 23:51.802
I want to commend your
performances today.

23:51.868 --> 23:55.196
For the most part, you all
followed the code of conduct,

23:55.221 --> 23:56.788
and were respectful.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.626
For the most part.

24:01.402 --> 24:04.867
I think this qualifies
as "local", so I'm good.

24:04.892 --> 24:07.182
Well, Snakerun Canyon
makes it regional.

24:09.233 --> 24:10.852
Suit yourself.

24:12.147 --> 24:14.413
Looks like you're gonna have to
file a report with the bank.

24:14.438 --> 24:15.891
And what about the stagecoach?

24:15.916 --> 24:17.507
I'll check on it for you, Jeb.

24:17.532 --> 24:19.349
Appreciate your help.

24:23.731 --> 24:26.008
You might be right about
us missing something.

24:26.033 --> 24:28.153
I need to head back to the bridge.

24:28.178 --> 24:29.811
Do you wanna come?

24:45.816 --> 24:47.149
You know, I think if we move some money

24:47.174 --> 24:48.241
out of the capital
expenditures account,

24:48.266 --> 24:50.067
we could still cover payroll.

24:56.899 --> 24:58.695
Lee Coulter's office.

24:59.219 --> 25:01.145
Yes, Fiona, put her through.

25:08.806 --> 25:09.872
Yes, sweetheart?

25:09.897 --> 25:10.730
Lee.

25:10.755 --> 25:12.020
<i>Rosie, you all right?</i>

25:12.045 --> 25:12.910
Yes.

25:12.935 --> 25:14.786
I just ran all the way
home to use the phone.

25:14.928 --> 25:16.915
You ran all the way home to use the-

25:16.940 --> 25:18.247
why didn't you just come here?

25:18.272 --> 25:21.846
<i>I just saw Faith and Carson.
And the way they were acting?</i>

25:22.123 --> 25:24.090
I know something is up.

25:24.115 --> 25:27.042
If that's the case, they'll let
us know when they're ready.

25:27.490 --> 25:30.524
Lee Coulter, how can you be so blasé?

25:30.549 --> 25:31.903
Wouldn't it be wonderful

25:31.928 --> 25:33.916
to have another wedding
here in Hope Valley?

25:33.985 --> 25:36.197
I'm dealing with a stolen
payroll right now.

25:36.222 --> 25:38.111
It's a little more important than that.

25:38.136 --> 25:39.168
More important?

25:39.193 --> 25:41.348
What's more important than romance?

25:41.832 --> 25:46.034
Rosemary, you have no idea
what is going on between...

25:46.316 --> 25:47.335
them.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.931
All right? So stop spreading rumours.

25:52.663 --> 25:54.780
I gotta get rid of that phone.

27:05.936 --> 27:07.825
Stagecoach driver said there
was a couple of robbers

27:07.850 --> 27:09.589
that fired off warning shots.

27:09.614 --> 27:11.147
And those shells I brought
in to you earlier today

27:11.172 --> 27:13.807
were about as close together as
the ones I just fired off now.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.469
If there were two people
firing warning shots,

27:15.494 --> 27:17.327
then these shells would be
spread out farther apart.

27:17.352 --> 27:19.614
So you think only one man fired shots?

27:20.001 --> 27:22.612
Which would explain why all the
shells were the same type.

27:23.630 --> 27:25.229
I think it was Jeb.

27:25.328 --> 27:26.872
He fired his own rifle.

27:27.235 --> 27:29.235
And then he grabbed the payroll box,

27:29.260 --> 27:30.594
and went over there.

27:30.619 --> 27:32.245
That's where he got mud on his boots.

27:32.270 --> 27:33.803
And Shiela, one of the passengers,

27:33.828 --> 27:36.404
said she saw five
masked men with rifles.

27:36.429 --> 27:38.098
Only I just looked, and
there's no way she could have

27:38.123 --> 27:40.563
seen these men from where
she said she was hiding.

27:42.799 --> 27:44.832
They planned this robbery together.

27:44.906 --> 27:46.539
And Shiela wasn't trying
to save Joyce's life;

27:46.564 --> 27:48.358
she wanted her out of the way.

27:48.472 --> 27:51.020
But why not just hi-tail
it out of town, then?

27:57.065 --> 27:58.278
Class dismissed.

28:00.734 --> 28:03.757
Don't forget your used books
for the library drive.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.113
We may not have a spot yet,

28:05.138 --> 28:07.560
but there's no reason
not to be prepared.

28:09.054 --> 28:11.433
Anna, Emily, would you two please stay?

28:12.917 --> 28:14.533
Take a seat.

28:16.746 --> 28:20.367
I appreciate how passionate
you are about your ideas.

28:20.392 --> 28:21.724
But just because you disagree,

28:21.749 --> 28:23.443
it doesn't make the other
person's point of view

28:23.468 --> 28:25.602
of any less value.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.387
When you stop listening
to your opponent

28:27.412 --> 28:29.351
and only mock their ideas,

28:29.376 --> 28:31.396
you only lose diplomacy and respect.

28:31.421 --> 28:34.614
How can we respect each other
when we completely disagree?

28:38.840 --> 28:40.396
Girls.

28:40.950 --> 28:43.855
If you are unwilling
to talk to each other,

28:44.264 --> 28:46.661
there's no way to heal this wound.

28:46.875 --> 28:51.066
Now, is this fight really worth
losing your friendship over?

28:55.463 --> 28:56.838
I'm sorry.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.401
Me too.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.487
How long til that stagecoach is ready?

29:20.861 --> 29:22.058
Sooner than I thought.

29:22.457 --> 29:24.074
Picked up some extra to help.

29:25.479 --> 29:26.812
Hi.

29:29.665 --> 29:31.534
Should be ready in about an hour.

29:33.268 --> 29:35.896
Well, you keep that information
to yourself for now, ya hear?

29:36.525 --> 29:38.076
Okay.

29:43.064 --> 29:44.685
I'll be right with you.

29:48.663 --> 29:49.466
Oh!

29:49.491 --> 29:50.524
Rosemary!

29:51.200 --> 29:52.636
Oh.

29:54.333 --> 29:56.873
It's not that I'm... not pleased.

29:57.310 --> 29:58.556
I'm just confused;

29:58.581 --> 30:01.146
why would you hide your
relationship from me?

30:01.261 --> 30:03.261
Rosemary, it's just...

30:03.297 --> 30:07.199
This relationship couldn't have
even happened without you.

30:07.234 --> 30:10.202
And for that, we're forever grateful.

30:10.293 --> 30:11.760
It's just that right now,

30:11.785 --> 30:15.090
we're still just trying to
figure this thing out, and...

30:15.739 --> 30:18.186
without the entire town's involvement.

30:18.346 --> 30:21.201
You know the minute it's out,
they'll be planning our wedding.

30:21.298 --> 30:23.751
Florence does get overly excited.

30:25.229 --> 30:26.962
So...

30:26.987 --> 30:29.610
We can count on you to
keep this between us?

30:32.052 --> 30:33.778
My lips are sealed.

30:41.366 --> 30:42.891
<i>What'll it be?</i>

30:43.426 --> 30:44.425
<i>Beer it is.</i>

30:44.450 --> 30:45.361
Sheriff.

30:45.386 --> 30:46.763
Ladies! Feeling better?

30:46.788 --> 30:47.948
Oh, yes. Thank you.

30:47.973 --> 30:49.516
But I'm anxious to get to Union City.

30:49.541 --> 30:51.052
My sister's waiting for me.

30:51.077 --> 30:52.476
Oh, well, unfortunately
I'm here to tell you

30:52.511 --> 30:54.455
that it may be a few days, ma'am.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.493
Days?

30:55.518 --> 30:56.897
Why?

30:59.263 --> 31:00.730
Well, I talked to the blacksmith,

31:00.755 --> 31:03.296
and it looks as though he has
to order a brand new axle.

31:03.522 --> 31:05.988
But there is the train,
one leaves in an hour.

31:06.345 --> 31:08.079
I'm glad you're feeling better.

31:22.126 --> 31:23.631
- Hey, Fiona.
- Hi.

31:23.656 --> 31:26.924
Um, so tell me, how
difficult would it be

31:26.949 --> 31:28.611
to cut Mrs. Coulter's line?

31:28.636 --> 31:29.836
It's a cinch.

31:29.861 --> 31:31.519
Though you could simply
remove the telephone.

31:31.544 --> 31:34.211
Oh, there's nothing simple
when it comes to Rosemary.

31:35.917 --> 31:38.048
Speaking of which...

31:40.183 --> 31:42.380
Good afternoon, Mrs. Coulter.

31:46.339 --> 31:48.689
One moment and I'll connect you.

31:55.427 --> 31:56.919
Hello.

31:56.944 --> 31:58.954
<i>Imagine if we had to
hide our relationship.</i>

31:58.979 --> 32:01.211
<i>That would be terrible.</i>

32:01.870 --> 32:03.542
What are you talking about?

32:03.567 --> 32:06.118
I want the whole world to
know how much I love you.

32:06.143 --> 32:08.896
I want to shout it from
the rooftops, Lee!

32:10.576 --> 32:13.131
You are my one and only.

32:13.373 --> 32:15.605
And I will sing your praises
as long as there is

32:15.630 --> 32:18.104
an ounce of air left in my lungs.

32:21.553 --> 32:23.975
I feel exactly the
same way, sweetheart.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.608
That's all.

32:43.399 --> 32:46.182
You know what, we're gonna
keep the house line in.

32:46.309 --> 32:47.849
Change of heart?

32:49.292 --> 32:52.244
Rosemary is the one
connection I never wanna cut.

32:54.098 --> 32:55.549
Thanks for your help.

33:03.956 --> 33:05.352
Hello?

33:05.569 --> 33:07.141
Anyone here?

33:08.635 --> 33:10.150
Keep a lookout.

33:18.401 --> 33:19.659
It's gone!

33:19.684 --> 33:21.588
What? How?

33:21.613 --> 33:23.762
I don't know how!

33:24.913 --> 33:26.112
Looking for this?

33:26.150 --> 33:27.928
Ugh!

33:27.953 --> 33:30.153
You and your brilliant ideas.

33:30.178 --> 33:32.236
She's the one who
messed with the bridge.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.760
A gentleman would take all the blame,

33:33.785 --> 33:35.274
but oh no, not you.

33:35.299 --> 33:37.174
Well, jail will allow you both time

33:37.198 --> 33:39.964
to re-evaluate your relationship.

33:53.363 --> 33:56.498
Well, Carson and Faith who
were in here this morning,

33:56.523 --> 33:58.991
as cozy as two bears in winter.

33:59.016 --> 34:00.368
Do you think they're a couple?

34:00.393 --> 34:01.826
Well, people are talking.

34:01.862 --> 34:02.994
And they shouldn't be.

34:03.029 --> 34:04.362
Excuse me!

34:04.397 --> 34:06.231
Carson and Faith are both adults.

34:06.256 --> 34:09.813
What they do or don't do
is none of our concern.

34:09.866 --> 34:13.170
Do you know something
you're not telling us?

34:14.333 --> 34:15.784
No.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.681
Which should prove to you
that there is absolutely

34:17.706 --> 34:20.244
nothing going on between
Carson and Faith.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.284
C'mere, you.

34:28.866 --> 34:30.862
Why, Lee Coulter...

34:31.114 --> 34:33.628
I do believe you're flirting with me!

34:33.652 --> 34:35.704
I'm not trying to hide it.

34:38.279 --> 34:40.018
I have a wonderful idea!

34:40.043 --> 34:40.708
Okay!

34:43.092 --> 34:46.809
So the driver and the passenger
made the whole thing up?

34:46.833 --> 34:49.493
The money was in the
stagecoach the entire time.

34:50.146 --> 34:52.158
And you figured that out?

34:52.567 --> 34:55.306
Well, me and Nathan.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.182
When I saw him in that red surge,

34:59.207 --> 35:01.494
it reminded me so much of Jack.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.275
You know you don't have
to meet him right now.

35:04.398 --> 35:06.698
I hear people haven't been
all that welcoming to him.

35:06.723 --> 35:08.958
Well, that might even include me.

35:08.983 --> 35:12.616
Arresting him wasn't exactly
the warmest how do you do.

35:14.909 --> 35:17.409
You are going to have to
meet him at some point.

35:17.547 --> 35:19.374
But there is no rush,

35:20.516 --> 35:22.692
just do it when it's right for you.

35:37.041 --> 35:38.775
<i>Excuse me.</i>

35:38.800 --> 35:41.868
I know people are allowed to act
foolish every once in a while,

35:41.893 --> 35:44.061
but you are certainly
abusing that privilege.

35:44.096 --> 35:45.260
Relax.

35:45.285 --> 35:46.250
I'm not here to fight.

35:46.275 --> 35:47.307
Excellent.

35:47.332 --> 35:48.597
What can I get you?

35:48.622 --> 35:49.855
Clara?

35:49.908 --> 35:51.141
Sorry, old chap.

35:51.166 --> 35:53.121
Isn't my day to watch her.

35:53.146 --> 35:55.058
Jesse! What are you doing here?

35:55.083 --> 35:56.469
Trying to get me fired?

35:56.494 --> 35:57.508
I've got good news!

35:57.533 --> 35:59.752
I got a second job. At the livery.

35:59.777 --> 36:01.010
So I'll be making more than enough,

36:01.035 --> 36:02.893
paying off my debt, save for a house.

36:02.918 --> 36:04.395
That's great.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.107
So...

36:06.782 --> 36:08.139
It means you can quit now.

36:08.164 --> 36:09.769
Jesse, I like working here.

36:09.794 --> 36:10.860
Why?

36:10.885 --> 36:12.335
Bouchard is such a jerk.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.533
Actually, he's not.

36:13.558 --> 36:15.458
He's a very nice man once
you get to know him.

36:15.789 --> 36:18.676
Jesse, I'm doing this for us.

36:20.189 --> 36:21.325
Why won't you believe me?

36:21.350 --> 36:22.739
I do believe you.

36:22.945 --> 36:26.180
Just... don't expect
me to like the guy.

36:26.521 --> 36:27.887
I don't.

36:42.859 --> 36:43.934
Carson!

36:43.959 --> 36:45.466
What are you doing here?

36:45.491 --> 36:47.081
Rosemary gave me a...

36:47.106 --> 36:49.171
A note, saying to meet at Lee's office?

36:49.196 --> 36:50.362
Yeah.

36:52.666 --> 36:54.659
Well, don't just stand there.

37:07.732 --> 37:10.017
I don't even-I don't
even know what to say.

37:10.042 --> 37:15.427
Well, why don't we start with drink up?

37:20.134 --> 37:22.331
Thank you for keeping our secret.

37:22.591 --> 37:25.753
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

37:26.970 --> 37:28.593
Enjoy.

37:36.762 --> 37:38.299
To good friends.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.165
The best.

37:40.934 --> 37:43.335
And to new possibilities.

37:56.818 --> 37:58.103
Hello.

38:01.229 --> 38:02.689
Ma'am?

38:03.392 --> 38:05.548
I'm Elizabeth Thornton.

38:06.237 --> 38:08.779
Mrs. Thornton.

38:08.804 --> 38:11.326
It's a pleasure to meet you.

38:12.044 --> 38:14.502
I never served with your late husband,

38:14.527 --> 38:19.457
but by all accounts, he
was an excellent Mountie.

38:20.322 --> 38:22.580
Jack was an excellent man.

38:23.156 --> 38:24.869
Yes, of course.

38:26.135 --> 38:28.346
I have something for you.

38:32.428 --> 38:33.961
Thank you.

38:35.053 --> 38:36.486
What is it?

38:36.511 --> 38:38.237
That's Jack's pension.

38:39.553 --> 38:41.053
I had forgotten about it.

38:41.078 --> 38:44.484
It's been almost a year since
I filled out the paperwork.

38:44.509 --> 38:46.655
Well, it's bureaucracy at its best.

38:52.304 --> 38:56.030
Thank you very much for bringing this.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.999
May I share something with you?

39:06.584 --> 39:09.051
You know, when I first came here,

39:09.076 --> 39:12.397
the townspeople were
quite skeptical of me.

39:12.870 --> 39:14.868
They really put me through the paces.

39:15.664 --> 39:19.389
But now, there is truly
no place I'd rather be.

39:20.875 --> 39:24.453
And I hope your experience
here will be equally as good.

39:26.556 --> 39:28.913
Thank you, Mrs. Thornton.

39:30.531 --> 39:33.098
Welcome to Hope Valley, Constable.
