00:00.482 --> 00:02.112
<i> Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast.

00:02.136 --> 00:03.136
Vincent, don't!

00:04.434 --> 00:06.034
No.

00:06.136 --> 00:07.568
<i>DHS is everywhere</i>
<i>looking for you.</i>

00:07.670 --> 00:09.137
You killed the deputy secretary.

00:09.239 --> 00:11.172
Someone, somehow,
is always after Vincent.

00:11.274 --> 00:12.306
And you're
enabling him.

00:12.408 --> 00:13.568
Cat, you're breaking the law.

00:13.642 --> 00:15.876
What if you stop
covering up?

00:15.978 --> 00:17.878
What if you stop
knowing what's going on?

00:17.980 --> 00:19.846
I want to be there
for you, but I can't,

00:19.948 --> 00:21.293
unless you stop
keeping secrets from me.

00:21.317 --> 00:22.516
Vincent's working
undercover

00:22.618 --> 00:24.551
for Homeland Security.

00:24.653 --> 00:26.686
Thank you for
telling me the truth.

00:26.788 --> 00:28.355
Someone's willing to pay

00:28.457 --> 00:30.301
$5 million to capture a beast.
There's a bounty?

00:30.325 --> 00:32.691
Graydal Securities is the one
behind the beast bounty,

00:32.793 --> 00:34.060
so that's where I'm going next.

00:34.162 --> 00:35.461
Graydal is not just

00:35.563 --> 00:36.862
your everyday security firm.

00:36.964 --> 00:39.399
They're like Blackwater
on steroids.

00:40.735 --> 00:42.135
Pretty ballsy move,

00:42.237 --> 00:43.736
you walking in here that way.

00:43.838 --> 00:45.038
So what's the problem?

00:45.140 --> 00:46.538
I don't trust you.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.106
That's the problem.

00:54.348 --> 00:55.613
Flat white.
Okay, yeah. Thanks.

00:57.251 --> 00:59.784
Non-fat soy mochas.

00:59.886 --> 01:01.386
Thank you, Donna.
You're welcome.

01:01.488 --> 01:03.921
Triple shot soy latte
and a chamomile tea.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.156
Thank you.
Oh, thanks.

01:05.257 --> 01:06.623
Okay, what's
going on?

01:06.725 --> 01:07.891
What do you mean?

01:07.993 --> 01:09.633
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

01:09.662 --> 01:11.728
First of all,
you do not drink tea.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.708
And secondly, you can't tell me
that you're not worried.

01:13.732 --> 01:14.932
You haven't heard from Vincent

01:15.034 --> 01:16.245
since he turned himself
in to Graydal

01:16.269 --> 01:17.513
and that was, like,
three days ago.

01:17.537 --> 01:18.669
But he's fine.

01:18.771 --> 01:20.336
Uh-huh.

01:20.439 --> 01:21.679
And this what
denial looks like.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.838
No.

01:22.941 --> 01:24.441
This is what
realizing

01:24.543 --> 01:26.443
you can't control
everything looks like.

01:26.545 --> 01:27.843
Vincent and I made a choice,

01:27.946 --> 01:29.179
we can't go back on it,

01:29.281 --> 01:30.846
so I'm just embracing my path.

01:30.949 --> 01:32.115
Wow.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.616
Must be some tea.

01:35.253 --> 01:37.019
Vincent didn't
turn himself in on a whim.

01:37.121 --> 01:38.287
We made a plan.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.821
JT's got eyes
on Graydal,

01:39.923 --> 01:41.168
so as soon as they
deliver Vincent

01:41.192 --> 01:42.491
to the beast buyer,

01:42.593 --> 01:43.903
we'll finally
figure out who it is.

01:43.927 --> 01:45.294
Okay, so you ID him or her.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.528
Then what?

01:46.630 --> 01:47.963
Okay, whoever it is

01:48.065 --> 01:50.031
has been looking
for a beast for months,

01:50.134 --> 01:51.734
and it can't be for
anything good, right?

01:51.768 --> 01:54.335
So once we figure it out,

01:54.437 --> 01:56.003
I will inform DHS

01:56.106 --> 01:58.306
and then they will
take him down.

01:58.408 --> 01:59.785
I still can't believe
they fired you.

01:59.809 --> 02:01.709
Not fired. Suspended.

02:01.811 --> 02:04.378
But even if they
don't take me back,

02:04.481 --> 02:08.116
hopefully us stopping whatever
this beast buyer is trying to do

02:08.217 --> 02:10.283
will be enough
for them to believe

02:10.386 --> 02:12.464
that Vincent isn't the bad guy
that they think he is.

02:12.488 --> 02:13.786
Om...

02:15.324 --> 02:17.124
Do not mock my Zen.

02:17.226 --> 02:18.636
Still, I wish a tea
could help me figure out

02:18.660 --> 02:20.037
whether or not I should
move in with Kyle.

02:20.061 --> 02:22.862
What? He asked?

02:22.964 --> 02:24.164
Isn't it a little early?

02:24.266 --> 02:25.898
Yeah. Especially 'cause I have

02:26.001 --> 02:27.501
to keep lying
to him about everything.

02:27.603 --> 02:28.712
I mean, it's easier
when it's on

02:28.736 --> 02:30.236
the occasional date, you know?

02:30.338 --> 02:32.138
But when it's over, like,
breakfast and lunch

02:32.240 --> 02:34.006
and dinner...
Well, bright side?

02:34.108 --> 02:36.875
If this plan works,
then we can all stop lying.

02:36.977 --> 02:37.977
What's up?

02:39.079 --> 02:40.079
Tess. Hey.

02:40.181 --> 02:41.247
Hi.
Hi.

02:41.349 --> 02:42.515
Really?

02:42.617 --> 02:44.049
Um, yeah.

02:44.152 --> 02:45.495
I don't...
I don't know why I did that.

02:45.519 --> 02:46.684
Cat, I get it.

02:46.786 --> 02:48.253
We're on opposite sides now.

02:48.355 --> 02:50.221
I'm Team Law and Order
and you're Team...

02:50.323 --> 02:52.089
No, I am still
Team Law and Order.

02:52.192 --> 02:53.558
Just sans badge.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.493
Yeah.

02:55.595 --> 02:57.662
Yeah, she's trying to get
justice for her husband

02:57.764 --> 02:59.764
and take down a bad man
with a bad plan.

02:59.866 --> 03:03.066
If that's not Team Law and
Order, I don't know what is.

03:03.169 --> 03:04.668
Look, for the sake
of our friendship,

03:04.770 --> 03:05.980
maybe we should just leave teams

03:06.004 --> 03:07.037
and plans
at the door.

03:07.139 --> 03:08.139
Less I know, the better.

03:08.174 --> 03:09.174
Okay.

03:09.208 --> 03:10.208
Okay.

03:10.309 --> 03:11.208
Okay.

03:11.310 --> 03:12.676
Okay.
Okay.

03:12.778 --> 03:14.411
Be careful.

03:19.151 --> 03:20.683
That was really awkward.

03:20.785 --> 03:21.917
Mm-hmm.

03:24.855 --> 03:27.256
JT, is everything okay?

03:29.060 --> 03:30.125
What's up?

03:32.697 --> 03:34.963
DHS is raiding Graydal.

03:38.001 --> 03:40.202
What is the meaning of this?

03:40.304 --> 03:43.104
We've got a search warrant,
looking for Vincent Keller.

03:43.207 --> 03:44.272
Who?

03:44.374 --> 03:45.273
Really?

03:45.375 --> 03:47.909
Okay.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.114
We don't hire fugitives
at Graydal.

03:53.216 --> 03:56.584
We offer high-level security.

03:56.686 --> 03:58.485
Search every door,

03:58.588 --> 04:00.454
every closet...

04:00.556 --> 04:01.722
everywhere.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.056
Okay, move out.

04:04.993 --> 04:06.059
Hustle, people.

04:06.161 --> 04:07.372
All right, taking
the north elevator.

04:10.265 --> 04:11.598
Have they found him?

04:11.700 --> 04:13.633
No, but it's only
a matter of time.

04:13.735 --> 04:15.901
Well, maybe they're looking
for somebody else.

04:16.003 --> 04:17.470
Agent Dylan's
leading the charge.

04:17.572 --> 04:19.272
Yeah, and her only job
is to find Vincent.

04:19.374 --> 04:20.584
How long have they
been in there for?

04:20.608 --> 04:21.774
20 minutes,
give or take.

04:21.875 --> 04:22.942
If they arrest him...

04:23.044 --> 04:24.344
I know.
I don't.

04:24.446 --> 04:25.745
Our only chance of showing DHS

04:25.847 --> 04:26.979
that Vincent's a good guy

04:27.081 --> 04:28.313
and not a crazed killer

04:28.415 --> 04:29.981
is before he gets caught,
not after.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.163
Otherwise, they're gonna put him
on trial for murder.

04:33.086 --> 04:34.986
I'll go make you some tea.

04:35.088 --> 04:37.422
Since when do
you drink tea?

04:37.524 --> 04:39.658
- They're coming out.
- What?

04:47.300 --> 04:48.666
So they didn't find him.

04:48.768 --> 04:51.168
Uh... apparently not.

04:51.271 --> 04:53.036
That's good news, right?

04:54.540 --> 04:55.773
Okay, what am
I missing now?

04:55.875 --> 04:58.643
If he was there,
DHS would've found him.

04:58.745 --> 05:00.778
Which means...?
Which means,

05:00.880 --> 05:03.212
if he's not there,
we don't know where he is.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:37.180 --> 05:38.546
Good news.

05:38.648 --> 05:41.048
They're gone

05:41.150 --> 05:42.317
and you're safe.

05:44.621 --> 05:47.822
Come on, Braxton,
what do you want from me?

05:47.924 --> 05:49.302
Well, it isn't
what I want, Keller--

05:49.326 --> 05:50.725
it's what the buyer wants.

05:51.994 --> 05:53.760
And until I can prove

05:53.862 --> 05:56.330
that you're everything
he needs you to be,

05:56.432 --> 05:58.532
I don't get paid

05:58.634 --> 06:01.100
and you don't leave.

06:01.203 --> 06:03.337
Please, just...

06:03.439 --> 06:04.938
let me go.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.940
I'm sorry, I really am,

06:07.042 --> 06:09.042
but my job

06:09.144 --> 06:13.379
is to find out
what kind of beast

06:13.481 --> 06:14.780
you really are.

06:14.882 --> 06:16.248
Oh, no, come on.

06:16.351 --> 06:17.516
No, no, no more.

06:17.618 --> 06:20.085
Come on, no, please, no, no!

How do you think I feel?

06:57.386 --> 06:58.619
So now what?

06:58.721 --> 07:00.320
You're free to go.

07:04.192 --> 07:06.359
What, just like that?
No more tests?

07:06.461 --> 07:07.994
I didn't say that.

07:09.297 --> 07:11.865
Put simply,

07:11.967 --> 07:14.134
although my client
seems satisfied

07:14.236 --> 07:16.435
with all the tests
I've run so far,

07:16.537 --> 07:18.104
he still has

07:18.206 --> 07:19.305
a few more questions.

07:19.407 --> 07:20.939
Questions?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.474
Come on, Braxton.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.354
Who is this guy and
what does he want from me?

07:24.378 --> 07:26.189
You're still trying
to find that out, aren't you?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.646
Well, I can't
blame you.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.525
I'd want to know why
someone was willing to pay

07:29.549 --> 07:31.016
$10 million for me, too.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.985
But you're not
paying me, he is,

07:33.087 --> 07:35.020
which means I do what he says.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.388
So more tests?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.689
Don't know.

07:37.791 --> 07:43.127
But you'll find
out soon enough.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.628
Like I said,

07:44.730 --> 07:46.063
you're free to go.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.902
Except for DHS,
of course,

07:51.004 --> 07:52.970
but that's
your problem,

07:53.072 --> 07:54.971
not mine.

07:55.073 --> 07:57.473
What makes you think
I'm not just going to kill you,

07:57.575 --> 07:59.375
right here, right now?

07:59.477 --> 08:01.912
Because that won't get you
the answers you're looking for.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.579
And because
I don't think

08:03.682 --> 08:05.381
you want to be
dealing with

08:05.483 --> 08:07.818
another murder
charge, either.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.252
Oh.

08:09.354 --> 08:12.922
The buyer will be
contacting you.

08:13.024 --> 08:14.857
He'll let you know
what the next test is.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.826
And if I don't do it?

08:16.928 --> 08:17.759
Then I'm screwed

08:17.862 --> 08:20.029
and you get exposed.

08:20.131 --> 08:23.065
Oh, it's all been recorded,

08:23.167 --> 08:24.733
everything that you are.

08:24.836 --> 08:26.735
And I've been instructed
to inform the press

08:26.838 --> 08:29.003
if you don't cooperate.

08:29.105 --> 08:30.972
Your choice.

08:34.376 --> 08:36.177
We must've
missed something.

08:36.279 --> 08:37.655
They must've gotten him
out of there somehow

08:37.679 --> 08:38.847
without us seeing it.

08:38.948 --> 08:40.181
I don't see how.

08:40.283 --> 08:41.626
I've got Graydal
completely covered.

08:41.650 --> 08:43.091
And I've been through
all the footage

08:43.186 --> 08:44.463
since Vincent arrived
and there's nothing.

08:44.487 --> 08:45.698
Okay, what about vans,
delivery trucks?

08:45.722 --> 08:47.287
Maybe they
snuck him out.

08:47.389 --> 08:49.000
No way, there's nothing
his size has left the building.

08:49.024 --> 08:51.258
Then where the hell is he?
Tea?

08:51.360 --> 08:53.080
Got anything stronger?

08:54.563 --> 08:56.529
Vincent!

08:56.631 --> 08:57.764
Hey.

08:57.867 --> 08:59.399
Oh...

08:59.501 --> 09:00.700
I was so worried.

09:00.802 --> 09:01.969
You look exhausted.

09:02.071 --> 09:03.236
Are you okay?

09:03.338 --> 09:04.904
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Liar.

09:05.006 --> 09:06.305
Where have you been?

09:06.407 --> 09:08.140
We thought you were
still at Graydal.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.376
I was.

09:10.478 --> 09:11.478
All right, full leaded.

09:11.512 --> 09:13.079
Oh, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

09:13.181 --> 09:14.046
But we didn't
see you leave.

09:14.148 --> 09:16.382
A tunnel
entrance.

09:16.484 --> 09:18.384
Their private access
to their beast cage.

09:18.486 --> 09:20.051
Their what?
Yeah.

09:20.153 --> 09:21.486
Apparently, whoever
is after me

09:21.588 --> 09:22.888
knows a lot more
about beasts

09:22.990 --> 09:24.289
than we thought,
right?

09:24.391 --> 09:25.957
Enough to keep me caged, anyway.

09:26.059 --> 09:26.958
Who could know that much
about beasts?

09:27.060 --> 09:28.459
Muirfield's gone.

09:28.561 --> 09:29.839
They're the only ones
who know anything.

09:29.863 --> 09:31.562
Well, obviously,
there's someone else.

09:31.664 --> 09:33.064
Did they hurt you?

09:33.166 --> 09:35.400
They did some tests.

09:35.502 --> 09:38.468
More to the point,
Braxton did the tests.

09:38.570 --> 09:40.504
And that's not the end of it.

09:40.606 --> 09:42.072
The beast buyer
wants to see more.

09:42.174 --> 09:43.340
More of what?

09:45.111 --> 09:47.878
Well, sounds like
we're about to find out.

09:49.681 --> 09:53.083
"Evidence 62156,

09:53.185 --> 09:55.251
"125th precinct.

09:55.353 --> 09:58.421
Retrieve, wait for further
instructions in two hours."

09:58.523 --> 10:00.123
"Retrieve"?
What the hell's that mean?

10:00.225 --> 10:03.259
It means that they want him
to steal case evidence...

10:03.361 --> 10:04.593
from my precinct.

10:04.695 --> 10:06.296
Which means
from Tess,

10:06.398 --> 10:09.198
who's not exactly
on Team Beast anymore.

10:09.301 --> 10:10.699
I don't like it.
Yeah.

10:10.802 --> 10:14.502
But seriously,
what choice do I have?

10:14.604 --> 10:16.338
Braxton's got me on tape...

10:17.808 --> 10:19.341
...beasting out.

10:19.443 --> 10:20.976
He's gonna expose me

10:21.078 --> 10:22.477
if I don't go through with it.

10:28.451 --> 10:29.783
JT's gonna hack
into Graydal,

10:29.885 --> 10:31.052
he'll get
Braxton's tapes

10:31.154 --> 10:33.120
and take away any
leverage he has.

10:33.222 --> 10:34.555
What, in two hours?

10:34.657 --> 10:36.991
Come on, if we've got
any hope of figuring out

10:37.093 --> 10:38.470
who's behind this
and stopping them,

10:38.494 --> 10:41.062
this is the only way.

10:41.164 --> 10:43.108
Why do you think I turned myself
into Graydal in the first place?

10:43.132 --> 10:45.031
That was before
Braxton caged you

10:45.133 --> 10:46.699
and before we knew
about these tests.

10:46.801 --> 10:48.534
Yeah, well, at least
he's not asking me

10:48.636 --> 10:50.403
to rip anybody's heart out.
Yet.

10:50.505 --> 10:51.905
It's bad enough
that he's asking you

10:51.940 --> 10:53.706
to steal evidence
from Tess's precinct,

10:53.808 --> 10:55.342
and that's only
the beginning.

10:55.444 --> 10:57.124
We don't even know
why they're testing you.

10:57.946 --> 10:59.212
Only one way to find out.

10:59.314 --> 11:01.147
Come on.

11:01.249 --> 11:03.148
We've been through this, right?

11:03.250 --> 11:04.984
Whatever our future holds,

11:05.086 --> 11:06.663
it starts with doing
whatever we got to do

11:06.687 --> 11:08.620
to clear my name
and stop this threat.

11:10.091 --> 11:11.256
One step at a time, okay?

11:14.362 --> 11:15.694
Okay.

11:15.796 --> 11:17.096
But I'm getting
the evidence.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.608
You're not going anywhere
near that precinct.

11:18.632 --> 11:19.930
Come on,
that's way, too...

11:21.034 --> 11:23.267
Unless you want
to be exposed.

11:23.370 --> 11:25.136
Come on.

11:39.184 --> 11:41.084
Tag, 62156.

11:41.186 --> 11:42.519
That the right number?

11:42.621 --> 11:44.854
62156, yeah, that's it.

11:44.956 --> 11:45.855
Joint investigation?

11:45.957 --> 11:47.424
Sorry?

11:47.526 --> 11:48.803
Well, you're a Fed
now, aren't you, Cat?

11:48.827 --> 11:50.260
I just assumed.

11:50.362 --> 11:51.928
Uh, right.

11:52.031 --> 11:53.440
Uh, no, actually,
I think it might be connected

11:53.464 --> 11:55.597
to a case that I was
working on when I was here.

11:57.135 --> 11:58.445
So it's not a joint
investigation.

11:58.469 --> 12:01.470
Not technically, no.

12:01.572 --> 12:03.439
Do you have authorization?

12:03.541 --> 12:06.442
Honestly, no.

12:06.544 --> 12:09.211
I was just hoping
that you would

12:09.313 --> 12:10.673
do me a solid
and let me borrow it,

12:10.713 --> 12:12.480
just for a day or two.

12:12.582 --> 12:14.416
Come on, Frank,

12:14.551 --> 12:16.562
if I have to wait to cut
through all this bureaucracy

12:16.586 --> 12:19.354
just to get what's in here,
I may lose everything.

12:25.028 --> 12:27.061
You still got to sign for it.

12:28.397 --> 12:29.763
Of course.

12:29.865 --> 12:31.498
Thank you, Frank.
I owe you.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.966
Big time.

12:51.419 --> 12:53.139
Yeah, get a report on my desk.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.856
Tess.
Cat, what are you doing here?

12:57.959 --> 13:00.293
Um, I was just hoping
to bump into you.

13:00.395 --> 13:01.960
Looks like we almost did.

13:02.062 --> 13:04.796
Mm.
I'll catch up.

13:04.898 --> 13:06.698
All right, see you later, Cap.
You all right?

13:07.801 --> 13:08.833
Sorry, that's a...

13:08.935 --> 13:09.935
that's a stupid
question.

13:11.338 --> 13:12.504
Look, this is weird.

13:12.606 --> 13:14.339
You know, I know
you're still trying

13:14.441 --> 13:16.401
to exonerate Vincent and
find out who's after him,

13:16.443 --> 13:17.976
and I get it,

13:18.078 --> 13:19.455
but I can't know about
that anymore, you know?

13:19.479 --> 13:20.911
At least,
not specifics.

13:21.013 --> 13:22.879
Not if I'm gonna follow
the law and do my job.

13:22.982 --> 13:25.882
I... I don't want
to do this to you anymore.

13:25.985 --> 13:27.485
It is not your problem.

13:27.587 --> 13:29.086
Then don't make it
my problem, okay?

13:29.188 --> 13:31.155
'Cause we're best
friends, Cat,

13:31.257 --> 13:33.235
that doesn't change, but I
don't want to be the one

13:33.259 --> 13:34.758
who ends up busting
you for something.

13:45.703 --> 13:47.470
Access denied.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.440
Access denied.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.352
Aren't you supposed
to be some ace hacker?

13:52.376 --> 13:54.276
DHS, Muirfield-- no problem.

13:54.378 --> 13:55.944
But some tiny little
security company...

13:56.046 --> 13:58.347
Graydal's not a tiny
little security company.

13:58.449 --> 14:01.950
Braxton's ex-NSA, he set the
place up like Blackwater, okay?

14:02.052 --> 14:03.385
Touchy.

14:03.487 --> 14:05.086
Sorry.

14:05.189 --> 14:06.955
I'm-I'm just worried.

14:07.057 --> 14:08.868
I don't like anybody
having proof about Vincent,

14:08.892 --> 14:10.558
let alone Braxton.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.804
Well, all the more reason
to break past his firewall now.

14:12.828 --> 14:14.795
I'm just saying.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.632
Just keep searching
through Braxton's background.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.635
Hopefully even he uses personal
information for passcodes.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.603
All right, fine.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.275
Kyle?

14:28.377 --> 14:29.709
Yeah.

14:29.811 --> 14:31.545
He wants
to have dinner.

14:31.647 --> 14:33.913
He keeps asking me if I'm gonna
move in with him or not.

14:36.017 --> 14:37.828
You're gonna have to give him
an answer sooner or later.

14:37.852 --> 14:40.587
Yeah, okay, maybe after we
help Vincent not get exposed.

14:40.689 --> 14:42.055
Then find out
who's after him.

14:42.157 --> 14:43.397
And then help
Cat exonerate him.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.123
When I'm 50.

14:49.397 --> 14:50.596
Go.

14:50.698 --> 14:53.131
I got this.

14:53.234 --> 14:54.600
The man deserves an answer.

14:54.702 --> 14:56.435
Well, okay, but how
do I give him one

14:56.537 --> 14:58.248
without continuing to lie
to him about everything?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.005
I don't know.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.084
I'm the last person to be
giving relationship advice,

15:02.108 --> 15:03.575
especially about cohabitation.

15:03.677 --> 15:06.010
This is my life.

15:06.112 --> 15:08.846
At least until I can help
save Vincent once and for all.

15:08.948 --> 15:10.648
Hopefully before <i> I</i> turn 50.

15:14.621 --> 15:16.521
Tess seriously doesn't
know what she's missing.

15:16.623 --> 15:17.954
Thank you.

15:18.056 --> 15:19.389
You're welcome.

15:26.365 --> 15:27.464
Access denied.

15:31.069 --> 15:33.537
Come on.

15:37.275 --> 15:39.355
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

15:41.379 --> 15:42.278
Where you been?

15:42.380 --> 15:43.279
The two hours is almost up.

15:43.381 --> 15:44.880
Did you get
the evidence?

15:44.982 --> 15:46.415
Yeah, I got it, all right.

15:47.552 --> 15:48.651
What's the matter?

15:50.421 --> 15:52.721
Actually, it's from a case
Tess and I worked on.

15:52.822 --> 15:54.322
The last one I did
as a detective.

15:54.424 --> 15:56.157
And?
And without it,

15:56.260 --> 15:59.561
the DA can't prosecute the perp
that we busted with it.

15:59.663 --> 16:00.962
He'll walk.

16:02.666 --> 16:05.600
Maybe we should reconsider
these tests?

16:13.305 --> 16:16.206
They're not just testing you,
Vincent, they're testing us.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.041
That was my case,
my precinct.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.721
Great. What do you want
me to do, you know?

16:19.745 --> 16:21.478
Take the gun back?

16:21.580 --> 16:23.391
Just pretend like we never
took it in the first place?

16:23.415 --> 16:25.549
"We" didn't
take it, I did.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.149
Which means
I'm on the hook now, too.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.917
Okay, I know,
all right? I'm sorry.

16:29.019 --> 16:30.364
It's just that they
got us by the neck,

16:30.388 --> 16:31.721
and I-I really
don't like it.

16:31.822 --> 16:33.723
We've got to figure out
what we're going to do,

16:33.824 --> 16:36.659
how far we're willing to go,
'cause maybe that's the test.

16:36.761 --> 16:38.093
Maybe.

16:38.195 --> 16:40.162
How far are we
willing to go?

16:40.265 --> 16:43.831
All I know is that if you get
exposed, everything's lost.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.734
So maybe we just do
what you said.

16:45.835 --> 16:47.569
We take this
one step at a time,

16:47.671 --> 16:50.272
we play along and hope JT
gets Braxton's tape before...

16:50.374 --> 16:52.294
Before we have to let any
criminals off the hook.

16:52.376 --> 16:53.675
Hey.

16:53.777 --> 16:55.543
Hey, hold up.

16:57.046 --> 16:59.414
461 Pell Street, 90 minutes.

16:59.516 --> 17:01.315
Chinatown, the Triad.

17:01.417 --> 17:03.984
Vincent, you can't
give them that gun.

17:04.086 --> 17:07.521
I can't just let
a Triad gang member walk.

17:07.623 --> 17:09.356
Obviously I'm gonna
have to hand it over

17:09.458 --> 17:10.790
if we want this to work.

17:10.893 --> 17:12.244
Unless we switch it out.

17:12.246 --> 17:13.612
You know, you take
back the real one.

17:13.636 --> 17:14.529
No.

17:14.530 --> 17:16.430
Erik Lee, the perp,
he's a gun guy.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.464
It's not gonna work, he'll know.
Of course he is.

17:18.566 --> 17:20.377
Maybe I can find some more
evidence against him.

17:20.402 --> 17:21.867
I'll have to.

17:21.969 --> 17:23.703
I'm sorry.

17:23.805 --> 17:25.704
You should have married Evan
in the first place.

17:25.807 --> 17:27.707
Yeah, biggest mistake
of my life.

17:34.248 --> 17:35.980
<i> I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like it.</i>

17:36.082 --> 17:37.616
The-the hardware's air-gapped,

17:37.718 --> 17:40.319
and Braxton's firewall's
completely impenetrable.

17:40.421 --> 17:42.053
Still, we have to get
Braxton's tapes

17:42.155 --> 17:44.475
before they make Vincent do
something worse. What's plan B?

17:44.558 --> 17:46.625
Get into Braxton's office,
bypass the firewall.

17:46.727 --> 17:48.694
Braxton's office?
How are you gonna do that?

17:48.796 --> 17:49.695
Hopefully by going in
through the front door.

17:49.797 --> 17:50.696
I just need a wife.

17:50.798 --> 17:52.162
Trust me.

17:52.264 --> 17:53.531
Long story.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.534
Don't do anything
too dangerous, okay?

17:56.636 --> 18:00.037
Look, I'm not giving up now,
not after all these years, okay?

18:00.139 --> 18:02.039
I don't know how to explain it,

18:02.141 --> 18:03.701
but I'm not just
doing this for Vincent.

18:03.776 --> 18:06.076
I'm doing it for me, too.

18:06.178 --> 18:09.512
I have this weird feeling that
this is what I'm supposed to do.

18:09.614 --> 18:12.248
I love you, JT.

18:13.352 --> 18:14.884
I love you, too.

18:14.986 --> 18:16.386
Be careful.

Promise.

No, Kyle, it's not

18:36.974 --> 18:40.275
I mean, ever since you told me
he went undercover for DHS,

you've been
a little distracted.

18:42.379 --> 18:43.411
Sorry.

18:43.513 --> 18:46.848
It's okay.

18:46.949 --> 18:48.916
At least I know why now.

18:49.018 --> 18:51.051
It meant a lot

18:51.153 --> 18:52.920
that you confided in me,

18:53.022 --> 18:55.956
told me what was
really going on.

18:59.661 --> 19:01.762
Is Vincent all right?

19:03.298 --> 19:04.598
- I don't know, um...

19:08.804 --> 19:10.704
JT.
Kyle.

19:10.806 --> 19:11.705
Nice to meet you.

19:11.807 --> 19:12.972
Is everything all right?

19:13.074 --> 19:15.141
No, uh, I, uh, need
your help.

19:15.243 --> 19:18.076
Uh, actually, uh, Cat does.

19:18.178 --> 19:20.312
The alarm went off
at her office again,

19:20.415 --> 19:23.148
but nobody's there,
and Cat's on a case,

19:23.250 --> 19:26.419
so can you let
the alarm company in?

19:26.521 --> 19:27.553
Yeah, sure.

19:27.655 --> 19:28.987
Uh, I'll be right back.

19:29.089 --> 19:30.823
Oh, no, you won't.

19:31.926 --> 19:33.258
I'll come with you guys.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.726
In case something's going on.

19:34.828 --> 19:36.260
Oh. No...
No...

19:36.362 --> 19:37.929
No, that's
not necessary.

19:38.031 --> 19:39.597
But we should go.

19:39.699 --> 19:41.833
Okay, um, I'll-I'll call you
later, uh, tonight.

19:41.935 --> 19:44.669
♪ Stay there all the time ♪

19:44.771 --> 19:46.404
♪ You can call my name... ♪

19:46.506 --> 19:48.406
The alarm? Really, JT?

19:48.508 --> 19:49.886
That's the best
you could come up with?

19:49.910 --> 19:51.241
It doesn't matter.

19:51.343 --> 19:52.643
Well, it matters to me.

19:52.745 --> 19:54.355
Now I think my boyfriend
is suspicious again.

19:54.379 --> 19:55.757
Forget your boyfriend,
you're a married woman now.

19:55.781 --> 19:57.180
Huh?

20:14.265 --> 20:16.499
You Keller?

20:16.601 --> 20:18.601
Yeah. Who wants to know?

20:18.703 --> 20:20.937
From what I hear,
quite a few people do.

20:21.038 --> 20:22.939
Especially DHS.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.973
You got something for me?

20:27.043 --> 20:28.543
Yeah.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.645
Nice to have friends
in high places.

20:31.448 --> 20:32.714
I wouldn't know.

20:32.816 --> 20:34.783
First you're gonna
tell me who it is

20:34.885 --> 20:36.618
and what the hell
this is about,

20:36.720 --> 20:39.031
'cause I really, really don't
like helping guys like you out.

20:39.055 --> 20:40.055
You know what I mean?

20:44.226 --> 20:48.061
I don't think so.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.964
Okay then.

20:50.065 --> 20:53.667
By the way, I was told
to give you this.

20:53.769 --> 20:55.068
What is it?

20:55.170 --> 20:57.037
Something about a test.

21:03.077 --> 21:04.176
Thanks again.

21:04.278 --> 21:05.344
It's my favorite gun.

21:05.446 --> 21:07.380
Yeah.

21:21.795 --> 21:22.795
Captain Vargas?

21:22.863 --> 21:24.262
Agent Olivia Dylan, DHS.

21:24.364 --> 21:26.665
You got a minute?
Sure.

21:26.767 --> 21:29.267
I was hoping you could help me
with a case I'm working on.

21:29.369 --> 21:31.870
All right. What case?

21:31.972 --> 21:32.972
Vincent Keller.

21:35.207 --> 21:37.675
Oh, come on.

21:37.777 --> 21:40.711
You don't really expect me to
believe that your best friend,

21:40.813 --> 21:42.090
your old partner,
hasn't told you

21:42.114 --> 21:43.358
what's going on
with her husband?

21:43.382 --> 21:46.383
Well, yeah, but she said
it was classified, so...

21:46.485 --> 21:49.453
Well, it's not
classified anymore.

22:02.668 --> 22:03.867
Where did you get these?

22:03.969 --> 22:05.101
I don't know.

22:05.203 --> 22:06.969
They just mysteriously

22:07.071 --> 22:09.137
landed on my desk.

22:09.239 --> 22:11.640
Happened today,
time-stamped an hour ago.

22:11.742 --> 22:13.108
Look, I-I don't
really care

22:13.210 --> 22:16.278
about Erik Lee,
but I do care about Keller.

22:16.380 --> 22:19.615
You got any idea what
the connection is?

22:19.717 --> 22:20.983
No.

22:21.085 --> 22:22.918
No? L-Lee was your case,

22:23.020 --> 22:25.386
wasn't he?
Yours and Chandler's?

22:25.488 --> 22:26.955
Yes, we busted him.

22:27.057 --> 22:28.801
He's out on bail,
but he's about to go to trial.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.258
Yeah, only if you still have
the evidence against him.

22:33.663 --> 22:35.262
Do you?

22:38.501 --> 22:41.969
<i>You gave Erik Lee the gun?</i>

22:42.071 --> 22:43.570
Couldn't you have, I don't know,

22:43.672 --> 22:46.106
blurred it out of his pocket
afterward or something?

22:46.208 --> 22:48.775
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I really didn't have a choice.

22:48.877 --> 22:51.177
Okay. Well, all the more reason
for us to bust

22:51.279 --> 22:53.446
whoever's behind this
so that we can get the gun back

22:53.548 --> 22:55.849
and hopefully bust
Erik Lee, again.

22:55.951 --> 22:57.550
Did you get any leads?

22:57.652 --> 22:59.351
Uh, no, no, but he gave me

22:59.453 --> 23:02.521
some claim ticket
to a dry cleaners across town.

23:02.624 --> 23:04.790
It's the next test, apparently.

23:04.892 --> 23:06.358
Look, have you made
any progress?

23:06.460 --> 23:07.359
No.

23:07.461 --> 23:08.527
No, I mean, JT got me

23:08.630 --> 23:10.062
access to Graydal's financials.

23:10.164 --> 23:11.875
I was hoping to backtrack
the payments to Braxton,

23:11.899 --> 23:14.133
ID someone, but there's just

23:14.235 --> 23:16.334
too many shady dealings
to sort through.

23:16.436 --> 23:19.137
Yeah, and I feel like we're on
such a slippery slope right now.

23:19.239 --> 23:21.706
Hopefully, the ends
justify the means.

23:21.808 --> 23:23.708
Depends on the means, I guess.

23:26.513 --> 23:27.846
Okay, call me when

23:27.948 --> 23:29.988
you figure out what's
at the cleaners, and hopefully

23:30.083 --> 23:32.415
by then, JT or I
will have something to help.

23:32.518 --> 23:33.583
Okay.

23:33.686 --> 23:35.585
Hey, I love you.

23:35.688 --> 23:37.655
I love you, too.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.699
Tess, what's going on?

23:49.801 --> 23:50.933
You're under arrest, Cat.

23:52.270 --> 23:54.070
Cuff her.

24:09.428 --> 24:11.595
No, the autopsy report
hasn't come in yet, so...

24:11.697 --> 24:14.164
So we're stuck with just
the composite drawings?

24:16.434 --> 24:17.967
I have to read you
your rights.

24:18.069 --> 24:19.302
Tess...

24:19.404 --> 24:21.004
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:21.106 --> 24:23.406
Anything you say
can and will be held against you

24:23.508 --> 24:24.718
in a court of law.
Tess, stop, please.

24:24.742 --> 24:25.753
You don't have to do this.

24:25.777 --> 24:27.076
Oh, yes, I do, Cat.
I warned you.

24:27.179 --> 24:28.411
I know. I know.

24:28.513 --> 24:30.779
But I didn't have a choice.

24:30.881 --> 24:32.948
Yeah, you did. You had a choice
not to take the gun.

24:33.050 --> 24:34.616
You had a choice
not to lie to my face

24:34.718 --> 24:36.696
right after you stole the gun.
I didn't lie to you, Tess.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.153
I said that I didn't
want to put you

24:38.255 --> 24:40.066
in any more compromising
situations, and I don't.

24:40.090 --> 24:41.530
Cat, you took
incriminating evidence.

24:41.558 --> 24:43.518
You let a dangerous perp
off the hook by doing so.

24:43.593 --> 24:45.272
Did you really think
you'd get away with this?

24:45.296 --> 24:46.195
No, I didn't.

24:46.297 --> 24:47.628
Then what were you thinking?

24:47.730 --> 24:49.864
I was thinking that I was
trying to save Vincent.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.032
That's what I
was thinking.

24:51.134 --> 24:53.134
I know you don't want to
hear it, and I get that,

24:53.236 --> 24:55.303
but that's the truth.

24:55.404 --> 24:57.438
Okay, I don't want

24:57.540 --> 25:00.141
Erik Lee to walk,
and I'm gonna do

25:00.243 --> 25:02.143
everything I can to make sure
that he doesn't.

25:04.980 --> 25:07.380
I don't know,
I just... I was just

25:07.482 --> 25:08.882
hoping that I'd
be able to do

25:08.984 --> 25:11.151
what we used to do
as cops, you know?

25:11.253 --> 25:16.356
Let the little fish go in
hopes of busting the big fish.

25:16.458 --> 25:21.060
All right, well, first of all,
you're not a cop anymore, okay?

25:21.162 --> 25:23.073
And, second, you don't even know
who you're after.

25:23.097 --> 25:25.297
No.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.467
But I do know that they spent
millions looking for a beast.

25:28.569 --> 25:31.070
I know they hired
Graydal to send out

25:31.172 --> 25:34.139
assassins and bounty hunters.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.009
Nobody does that unless
they're planning something huge.

25:37.111 --> 25:39.410
I get that you don't
want to be involved

25:39.512 --> 25:41.012
in any of this anymore.
Yeah.

25:41.114 --> 25:42.680
I do get that.

25:42.782 --> 25:46.517
But I don't have
that option.

25:46.619 --> 25:48.987
Graydal is gonna
expose my husband,

25:49.089 --> 25:51.722
expose everything about
him unless we cooperate.

25:51.824 --> 25:52.723
Cooperate how?

25:52.825 --> 25:54.092
Whoever is behind this,

25:54.194 --> 25:56.393
he's forcing Vincent,
forcing us,

25:56.495 --> 25:58.561
to do all of these things.

25:58.663 --> 26:01.598
Maybe it's to see how
far we're willing to go.

26:01.700 --> 26:06.503
All I know is that if we don't,
everything's lost.

26:06.605 --> 26:09.472
That explains the photos.

26:12.310 --> 26:14.944
Yeah, somebody anonymously took
photos of Vincent with Erik Lee,

26:15.046 --> 26:17.246
and then slipped them
to Agent Dylan.

26:17.348 --> 26:19.448
That's how I found out
about the missing evidence.

26:19.550 --> 26:20.917
Now they're gonna set him up.

26:21.019 --> 26:22.019
Yeah.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.852
We're being blackmailed, Tess.

26:23.955 --> 26:26.315
Obviously, somebody's doing
everything and anything they can

26:26.357 --> 26:28.690
to get Vincent to do something
he doesn't want to do.

26:28.793 --> 26:29.891
But do what?
I don't know,

26:29.993 --> 26:31.927
but it has to be
something big, right?

26:32.029 --> 26:33.761
Otherwise, why put us
through all this?

26:33.863 --> 26:35.931
Please, Tess, come on.

26:36.033 --> 26:37.532
You have got to let me go.

26:37.634 --> 26:39.367
Cat...
Not...

26:39.469 --> 26:41.903
Not as a friend, okay?

26:42.005 --> 26:43.405
As a cop.

26:43.506 --> 26:46.240
You know that I'm
telling you the truth.

26:46.342 --> 26:47.707
You've seen the other people

26:47.810 --> 26:49.543
that we've been up against
in the past.

26:49.645 --> 26:51.312
As a cop,

26:51.414 --> 26:53.247
you should want to do
everything in your power

26:53.349 --> 26:55.416
to stop whoever it is
we're up against this time.

26:57.719 --> 27:01.322
Besides, you know,
I'm-I'm just a little fish.

27:06.061 --> 27:07.793
All right.

27:07.895 --> 27:10.629
You have 48 hours,
and that is it.

27:10.731 --> 27:12.631
You better come back
with a big fish

27:12.733 --> 27:14.133
and new evidence on Erik Lee.

27:14.235 --> 27:15.935
Otherwise, I won't have
a choice,<i> capisce?</i>

27:17.038 --> 27:18.304
All right, let's go.

27:41.594 --> 27:42.693
Can I help you?

27:42.795 --> 27:44.261
Yeah.

27:44.364 --> 27:45.997
Is this Agent Chandler's office?

27:46.099 --> 27:48.032
It used to be,
before she got suspended.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.266
What?

27:49.369 --> 27:51.502
Do you know Agent Chandler?

27:52.872 --> 27:54.837
Uh, I mean, yeah, a little.

27:54.939 --> 27:55.939
I'm dating her sister.

27:56.975 --> 27:58.608
Did an alarm go off here
last night?

27:58.710 --> 28:01.844
Just wait here.

28:11.389 --> 28:12.521
Hi.

28:12.623 --> 28:14.456
I'm Agent Olivia Dylan.

28:14.558 --> 28:17.026
Did you say you're
dating Heather Chandler?

28:17.128 --> 28:18.128
Yeah.

28:18.162 --> 28:19.402
Well, I was under
the impression

28:19.497 --> 28:21.963
that Professor Forbes was
dating Heather Chandler.

28:22.066 --> 28:23.798
Professor Forbes?
Yeah.

28:23.901 --> 28:25.700
JT?

28:25.802 --> 28:27.669
What's going on?

28:35.811 --> 28:37.811
Apparently, they're married.

28:37.914 --> 28:39.514
Huh?

28:40.616 --> 28:41.815
What if we get caught?

28:41.918 --> 28:43.418
We won't,

28:43.520 --> 28:45.652
as long as you don't freak out, dear.

28:45.754 --> 28:48.021
Well, then what's
taking so long?

28:48.123 --> 28:49.600
Probably just doing
a background check.

28:49.624 --> 28:50.857
Relax.

28:50.959 --> 28:53.360
Braxton won't see just anybody.
Hmm.

28:53.462 --> 28:54.727
Don't worry.

28:54.829 --> 28:57.830
I spent all night making sure
our covers were bulletproof.

28:57.933 --> 28:59.066
We're stinking rich.

28:59.168 --> 29:00.667
Dot-com rich.

29:00.769 --> 29:02.668
So what am I,
your trophy wife or something?

29:02.770 --> 29:04.336
Ouch.

29:04.439 --> 29:06.038
That's not what I meant.

29:06.140 --> 29:08.607
Just charm Braxton.

29:08.709 --> 29:10.320
Keep his attention
away from his computer.

29:10.344 --> 29:12.144
No, I know. And then
you'll take the doohickey

29:12.213 --> 29:14.173
and insert it into the
computer, and it'll take it

29:14.215 --> 29:15.692
from the airlock to
the cloud or something.

29:15.716 --> 29:16.716
Close enough.

29:16.784 --> 29:17.916
Important thing is

29:18.018 --> 29:19.429
we'll have remote access
to the exposure tapes,

29:19.453 --> 29:20.918
and we can get the hell
out of here.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.354
And you really think
this is gonna work?

29:23.457 --> 29:25.690
Braxton has $10 million
riding on Vincent's secret,

29:25.792 --> 29:27.092
so, no, not sure.

29:27.194 --> 29:29.461
But it's our best plan.

29:29.563 --> 29:31.429
Right.

29:31.531 --> 29:33.131
Mr. and Mrs. King?

29:33.233 --> 29:34.399
Yeah.

29:34.501 --> 29:35.700
Mr. Braxton will see you now.

29:35.802 --> 29:37.634
Great.
Great.

29:42.741 --> 29:45.909
People normally pick
up clothes at the dry cleaners,

29:46.011 --> 29:48.445
not plastic explosives.
It was in the bag.

29:48.547 --> 29:50.292
Apparently, the cleaners
thought it was clay.

29:50.316 --> 29:53.116
Obviously, they did not
see the detonator.

29:53.218 --> 29:56.085
Any idea what the man behind
the curtain wants to do with it?

29:56.187 --> 29:58.147
No, not yet, but whatever it is,
it can't be good.

29:58.189 --> 30:00.033
I mean, this thing can
blow up an entire building.

30:00.057 --> 30:01.657
Okay, what are we gonna do?

30:01.759 --> 30:03.092
Not that, obviously.

30:03.194 --> 30:05.228
This is where we draw
the line, right?

30:05.330 --> 30:06.662
Yes, of course.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.964
We can't kill innocent people
just to cover up a secret.

30:09.033 --> 30:10.165
Which leaves us where?

30:10.267 --> 30:12.334
Well, I was kind of hoping

30:12.436 --> 30:13.735
you might be able to identify

30:13.837 --> 30:15.317
whoever is pulling
the puppet strings.

30:15.405 --> 30:17.405
No such luck.

30:17.508 --> 30:18.973
Which I admit
is really weird,

30:19.075 --> 30:22.277
because no matter where I look,
all roads lead to Graydal.

30:22.379 --> 30:23.745
Uh, meaning?

30:23.847 --> 30:25.947
Meaning either I am
a lousy detective

30:26.049 --> 30:28.582
and I can't find a connection...
Right.

30:28.684 --> 30:29.783
...or there isn't one.

30:29.885 --> 30:31.118
There's got to
be a connection.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.753
I mean, Braxton's
got a contract

30:32.855 --> 30:35.189
from a client for
$10 million to find me.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.823
There's got to be a money trail,

30:36.925 --> 30:39.293
uh, case files, e-mails,
something.

30:39.395 --> 30:41.728
It just doesn't
make any sense.

30:44.133 --> 30:47.267
Unless the beast
buyer doesn't exist.

30:47.369 --> 30:49.035
Come on.

30:49.137 --> 30:51.471
No... think about it.

30:51.573 --> 30:53.939
Braxton is the one that
caged you, he did tests on you,

30:54.042 --> 30:55.975
then he claimed to send you off
to somebody else

30:56.077 --> 30:57.717
who wanted to do
tests on you, too, right?

30:57.779 --> 30:59.011
Mm-hmm.

30:59.113 --> 31:00.924
Okay, so what if that
somebody else doesn't exist?

31:00.948 --> 31:02.381
Mm?

31:02.483 --> 31:04.027
What if the reason
I can't find a client

31:04.051 --> 31:05.484
is because there isn't one?

31:07.120 --> 31:08.840
Vincent, what if
Braxton is the beast buyer,

31:08.922 --> 31:11.823
and all of this is a facade
to keep us from finding out?

31:18.131 --> 31:19.697
It's JT.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.965
He's at Graydal.

31:22.068 --> 31:24.001
What?

31:24.103 --> 31:25.135
Yeah, JT.

31:25.238 --> 31:26.136
No.

31:26.239 --> 31:28.772
Actually, it's Braxton.

31:31.578 --> 31:34.078
We've got ourselves a problem.

31:39.702 --> 31:42.634
I can't believe that Braxton
was behind this the whole time.

31:42.636 --> 31:44.417
And he didn't even care that
we found out it was him.

31:44.418 --> 31:45.652
It didn't bother him one bit.

31:45.653 --> 31:47.631
Yeah, that's because he thinks
he's holding all the cards,

31:47.655 --> 31:49.455
and not just with
the threat of exposure now.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.726
I never should've let JT
go in there.

31:54.828 --> 31:56.472
I didn't know he was
gonna take Heather with him.

31:56.496 --> 31:58.730
Hey, come on, it's gonna
be fine, all right?

31:58.832 --> 32:01.967
I promise you.
Braxton won't hurt them.

32:02.069 --> 32:03.579
Yeah, unless you don't
pass the next test,

32:03.603 --> 32:05.837
which is blowing up
my DHS office.

32:05.939 --> 32:08.406
But I won't do it.
You know I can't.

32:08.508 --> 32:10.440
I know, but what
are we gonna do?

32:12.211 --> 32:13.844
You know, maybe

32:13.946 --> 32:17.347
it's about time we started using
a little leverage ourselves.

32:17.449 --> 32:18.348
Look, Agent Dylan's
been trying to take down

32:18.450 --> 32:20.017
Braxton for years, right?

32:20.119 --> 32:22.364
That's why he's trying to kill
her by blowing up your office.

32:22.388 --> 32:24.688
And setting you up
to take the fall.

32:24.791 --> 32:25.834
Yeah. You think
you have enough proof

32:25.858 --> 32:27.791
to build a case against him?

32:27.893 --> 32:29.170
Maybe. But DHS isn't gonna
believe anything I found.

32:29.194 --> 32:30.593
Yeah, but maybe he will.

32:30.695 --> 32:32.495
Maybe we could force
a confession out of him.

32:32.597 --> 32:34.630
What are you thinking?

32:34.732 --> 32:37.200
I'm thinking we do
what we were planning

32:37.302 --> 32:38.467
from the beginning--

32:38.569 --> 32:39.635
find out who's behind this

32:39.737 --> 32:40.970
and get DHS to bust them.

32:42.407 --> 32:43.606
All we have to do now

32:43.708 --> 32:46.809
is make DHS believe
that they're...

32:46.911 --> 32:48.677
busting me.

32:57.221 --> 32:59.487
Agent Dylan!

32:59.589 --> 33:00.488
We just spotted Keller.

33:00.590 --> 33:01.488
Where?

33:01.590 --> 33:02.590
Grand Central Station.

33:03.659 --> 33:05.159
That's him. 100% match.

33:05.261 --> 33:06.527
Grand Central?

33:07.596 --> 33:08.495
What is he doing?

33:08.597 --> 33:09.964
Alert all units!

33:10.066 --> 33:11.165
All right, let's go!

33:11.267 --> 33:12.166
All right, let's go, guys.

33:12.268 --> 33:13.868
Don't lose him!

33:13.970 --> 33:15.380
- Let's go! Go, go, go!
- Hey... you're with me!

33:15.404 --> 33:16.615
Come on, let's go!
Keller's been spotted!

33:16.639 --> 33:18.872
Sure taking them
long enough to spot me.

33:18.974 --> 33:21.507
Yeah.
Your tax dollars at work.

33:21.609 --> 33:23.476
Don't worry, they'll find you.

33:23.578 --> 33:24.677
Ugh. They better.

33:24.779 --> 33:26.046
You at Graydal?

33:26.148 --> 33:27.380
Ready and waiting.

33:27.482 --> 33:29.482
Okay, good.

33:29.584 --> 33:30.761
Hey, don't forget
about the guard

33:30.785 --> 33:31.896
just in the tunnel
entrance, okay?

33:31.920 --> 33:33.220
I won't.

33:33.322 --> 33:35.420
And don't you forget
to not get caught.

33:35.522 --> 33:37.056
Kind of defeats
the whole purpose.

33:37.158 --> 33:39.191
Yeah, I promise.

33:40.494 --> 33:42.094
Okay, gotta run.

33:42.196 --> 33:43.695
Hey!

33:56.743 --> 33:58.476
Keller's not answering my texts.

33:58.578 --> 33:59.989
Probably because
they're chasing him.

34:00.013 --> 34:00.912
What do you mean?

34:01.014 --> 34:02.146
Who's chasing him?

34:02.249 --> 34:03.714
DHS. We just found out.

34:03.816 --> 34:04.715
It's a full alert.

34:04.817 --> 34:06.650
Where are they chasing him to?

34:06.753 --> 34:09.585
I think to us.

34:14.994 --> 34:17.793
Hey. I'd put my hands up
if I were you.

34:26.204 --> 34:28.036
Put your weapons down!

34:40.784 --> 34:42.717
Come on. Get up.

34:44.420 --> 34:46.087
Now!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

34:46.188 --> 34:47.588
Wait, wait--
where are we going?

34:47.690 --> 34:50.292
To where your friends
can't help DHS to find you.

34:50.393 --> 34:52.260
Freeze!

34:52.362 --> 34:53.527
Cat!

34:53.630 --> 34:54.695
Drop it, now.

34:55.764 --> 34:56.864
I said, drop it.

35:06.943 --> 35:08.309
You don't know what
you're doing.

35:08.411 --> 35:10.177
I know exactly what I'm doing.

35:10.279 --> 35:11.345
So don't test me.

35:12.415 --> 35:13.314
You think the only reason

35:13.416 --> 35:14.949
that I was testing Vincent

35:15.051 --> 35:16.483
was to see whether
he'd blow up

35:16.585 --> 35:17.917
some dumb DHS office?

35:19.654 --> 35:21.299
I didn't go through all this,
I didn't spend months

35:21.323 --> 35:23.522
looking for somebody
like Vincent, for that.

35:23.624 --> 35:25.959
Let me guess, there's
a bigger bad out there

35:26.061 --> 35:27.293
you're really trying to stop?

35:27.395 --> 35:29.329
Yeah, there is.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.696
Of course there is.

35:30.798 --> 35:32.243
You knew Agent Dylan
was getting close,

35:32.267 --> 35:33.833
that's why
you blackmailed Vincent

35:33.935 --> 35:35.567
into trying to get rid of her.

35:35.669 --> 35:37.402
You knew it was only
a matter of time

35:37.504 --> 35:38.544
before she found out about

35:38.605 --> 35:39.649
all the fugitives you hired,

35:39.673 --> 35:41.539
the hit men-- Erik Lee?

35:41.641 --> 35:42.841
Erik Lee?

35:42.943 --> 35:44.076
He was nothing!

35:44.178 --> 35:45.877
The only reason
I forced Vincent

35:45.980 --> 35:47.260
to get him off
was to set him up.

35:47.348 --> 35:49.481
And those fugitives,
those hit men?

35:49.583 --> 35:52.483
They helped me stop bad
people from doing bad things--

35:52.585 --> 35:55.853
things FBI, DHS and even
CIA wouldn't do!

35:55.955 --> 35:57.521
That's why I created Graydal!

35:57.623 --> 35:59.523
I don't
have to apologize for that!

35:59.625 --> 36:00.757
Yeah, maybe not...

36:00.860 --> 36:02.826
but you're about
to pay for it.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.029
Because you just confessed.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.698
JT, you can stop recording.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.977
I think we have
everything we need.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.902
Okay.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.437
I won't be the only
one who pays.

36:14.539 --> 36:17.207
DHS will find those tapes,
sooner or later.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.175
You'll be exposed.

36:19.277 --> 36:22.278
Yeah. We know.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.047
But I'm not about
to let innocent people die

36:25.149 --> 36:26.748
just to protect my identity.

36:26.850 --> 36:28.250
Nor will we let you
use Vincent

36:28.352 --> 36:30.386
to do whatever else
you wanted him to do.

36:30.488 --> 36:34.256
I didn't want Vincent
to <i> do</i> something.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.225
I wanted him
to <i> stop</i> something.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.029
Something only
a beast <i> can</i> stop.

36:40.131 --> 36:43.297
Please don't tell me there's
another beast out there.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.266
I don't believe you
for a second.

36:45.368 --> 36:46.567
Well, you better believe me,

36:46.669 --> 36:49.037
because if DHS
arrests me,

36:49.139 --> 36:51.639
you won't know
how to stop him.

36:53.076 --> 36:54.142
He's lying.

36:54.244 --> 36:55.244
Let's get outta here.

36:59.015 --> 37:00.347
No!

37:08.924 --> 37:10.123
No! You're the...

37:10.225 --> 37:11.624
you're the only one--

37:11.726 --> 37:13.093
you're the only one...

37:13.195 --> 37:15.028
who can stop him!

37:24.344 --> 37:25.910
Agent Dylan.

37:26.013 --> 37:27.979
Looks like you got
the mother lode.

37:28.081 --> 37:28.980
Thanks for the backup, Captain.

37:29.082 --> 37:30.515
Much appreciated.

37:30.617 --> 37:32.150
Hey, we're on
the same team, right?

37:32.252 --> 37:33.384
Did you get Keller?

37:33.486 --> 37:35.185
No, he got away.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.587
So, what, he led you here

37:37.690 --> 37:39.023
just so you could
bust Braxton?

37:39.125 --> 37:40.991
Apparently.

37:41.093 --> 37:43.226
Got Braxton on tape
confessing, too.

37:43.328 --> 37:46.163
I've been trying to bring
that bastard down for years.

37:46.265 --> 37:50.000
He even implicated
Erik Lee, lucky you.

37:50.102 --> 37:52.234
So it kind of makes
you wonder, right?

37:52.336 --> 37:54.904
Why a fugitive
like Keller would want

37:55.006 --> 37:57.106
to help us bust
Graydal <i> and</i> Lee?

37:57.208 --> 37:59.942
Look, just because Keller
did something good,

38:00.045 --> 38:02.211
doesn't mean
he's not still bad.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.013
Right, but why would
he risk getting caught

38:04.115 --> 38:05.581
just to help you
nail Braxton?

38:07.652 --> 38:09.029
Hey, maybe he's not
so bad after all.

38:09.053 --> 38:11.053
Maybe there's more to what
he did than you know.

38:12.522 --> 38:14.022
Maybe.
Yeah.

38:14.124 --> 38:17.893
Let's see what turns up
on Braxton's computers.

38:17.995 --> 38:19.594
All right.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.810
♪ Help me ♪

38:35.912 --> 38:40.815
♪ 'Cause I'm feeling shaky ♪

38:40.917 --> 38:43.049
♪ Tell me what's wrong
with my brain... ♪

38:45.887 --> 38:47.587
Maybe you should go.

38:47.689 --> 38:51.124
It's only a matter of time
before they find you here.

38:51.226 --> 38:54.427
I'd rather they found me here
than anywhere else.

38:56.664 --> 38:59.264
Catherine, I'm done running.

38:59.366 --> 39:02.167
But what if DHS has
found Braxton's tapes?

39:03.771 --> 39:05.104
I'm screwed either way.

39:06.741 --> 39:09.074
It's not fair.

39:09.176 --> 39:10.909
Hill set you up,
Braxton set you up.

39:11.011 --> 39:12.144
Come on,
it doesn't matter.

39:12.246 --> 39:14.346
Yes, it does, Vincent.

39:14.448 --> 39:16.247
You're a good man.

39:16.349 --> 39:18.582
You know? You've
sacrificed too much.

39:18.684 --> 39:21.452
<i>We've</i> sacrificed too much
to have it end like this.

39:21.554 --> 39:24.756
Well, nobody said
life was fair, huh?

39:24.858 --> 39:27.691
We have to keep fighting,
Vincent-- for us.

39:27.794 --> 39:29.927
It's not gonna be easy.

39:30.029 --> 39:32.029
Once I'm exposed to the world...
If you're exposed.

39:33.065 --> 39:34.430
I will be.

39:34.532 --> 39:35.766
It's just
a matter of time

39:35.868 --> 39:37.400
before DHS finds
those tapes.

39:38.570 --> 39:40.270
We can't stop it.

39:40.372 --> 39:41.805
Then maybe we should run.

39:41.907 --> 39:43.339
Maybe we should
get away from here.

39:45.210 --> 39:46.609
Really? Where?

39:46.711 --> 39:48.111
I don't know. Anywhere.

39:48.213 --> 39:50.545
All I care about is
if we're together.

39:51.883 --> 39:53.382
Hey...

39:53.484 --> 39:55.151
♪ 'Cause I'm afraid
of the light ♪

39:55.253 --> 39:58.854
♪ Yeah, you know what I mean ♪

40:01.159 --> 40:03.725
We could, you know.

40:03.828 --> 40:07.061
We could; we've done
what we set out to do--

40:07.164 --> 40:10.865
we found out who's
after me, we saved lives.

40:12.502 --> 40:14.836
But what if he was
telling the truth?

40:14.938 --> 40:16.204
What if there's another...?

40:16.306 --> 40:17.705
There's not, okay?

40:17.808 --> 40:20.508
All of that ended long ago.

40:20.610 --> 40:23.544
Braxton would've said
anything to save his own ass.

40:34.924 --> 40:36.156
It's gonna be okay.

40:43.031 --> 40:45.364
You need to come with me.

40:54.542 --> 40:56.575
Ugh. Okay. Yeah.

40:56.677 --> 40:58.043
Where's the rest of him?

40:58.145 --> 40:59.677
Don't know.
This is all they found.

40:59.779 --> 41:01.746
Okay, are you sure
that this is Braxton?

41:01.849 --> 41:04.049
DNA and dental records match.

41:04.151 --> 41:05.750
Where'd it happen?

41:05.853 --> 41:08.253
In jail,
after DHS arrested him.

41:10.457 --> 41:12.790
Huh. So Braxton
wasn't lying after all.

41:12.893 --> 41:15.459
It seems we have
another beast on our hands.

41:18.099 --> 41:20.199
But how's that possible?
