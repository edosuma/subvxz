00:04.705 --> 00:08.442
AFTER KEVIN PLAYED NICE WITH
PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER 1 -- I'M

00:08.476 --> 00:09.510
COMING FOR YOU EVERY WEEK.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.811
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.780
>> IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FROM THE
START.

00:12.813 --> 00:19.353
>> HIS ALLIES BEGAN TO LOSE
TRUST IN HIM.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.789
>> KEVIN IS EXTREMELY SKETCHY.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.158
I KNOW KEVIN AND CODY ARE
TALKING.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.959
I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:25.993 --> 00:31.365
>> THE HOUSE HAD THEIR SIGHTS
TAKING OUT CODY.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.202
>> I'D RATHER DIE ON MY FEET
THAN LIVE ON MY KNEES.

00:34.235 --> 00:40.341
>> MARK WAS PLANNING FOR A
FUTURE TARGET.

00:40.374 --> 00:45.279
>> AT THE DOUBLE EVICTION, CODY
ONCE AGAIN STIRRED THE POT.

00:45.313 --> 00:49.717
>> ALEX, YOU PLAYED A DIRTY GAME
THIS WEEK, YOU AND JASON.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.221
YOU TRIED TO FLIP THE HOUSE.
>> IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO SAVE THE

00:53.254 --> 00:54.388
SNIPER.

00:54.422 --> 01:00.894
>> BY A VOTE OF 7-0-0, CODY
YOU'RE EVICTED FROM THE "BIG

01:00.928 --> 01:02.163
BROTHER" HOUSE.

01:02.196 --> 01:07.135
>> WITH THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD ON
THE LINE, JASON GOT AN EXTREMELY

01:07.168 --> 01:08.202
IMPORTANT VICTORY.

01:08.236 --> 01:14.608
>> CONGRATULATIONS, JASON!
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF

01:14.642 --> 01:17.211
HOUSEHOLD!
>> AT NOMINATIONS, JASON THREW

01:17.245 --> 01:18.979
MARK UNDER THE BUSINESS.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.248
>> WE PLAYED CHESS.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.451
YOU SAID IF WE DON'T MAKE A BIG
MOVE NOW, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO

01:23.484 --> 01:25.052
GET THEM OUT.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.621
>> THEN THE COWBOY PUT UP
MARLENA.

01:27.655 --> 01:31.024
>> I'M GOING TO NOMINATE YOU
MARK.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.261
ELENA, YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SEAT
NEXT TO MARK.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.028
>> BUT MARK WOULDN'T BE THERE
LONG.

01:35.062 --> 01:39.400
>> CONGRATULATIONS, MARK!
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.002
>> WITH THE PERSONAL TRAINER
SAFE --

01:42.035 --> 01:44.305
>> I'M GOING TO USE THE VETO ON
MYSELF.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.707
>> JASON APPOINTED A NEW
NOMINEE.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.244
>> MATT, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL
PUT YOU NEXT TO ELENA.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.912
>> WELCOME BACK.

01:51.945 --> 01:58.452
>> AT THE SECOND EVICTION,
MARK'S HONEY LOST THE MONEY.

01:58.486 --> 02:03.491
>> ELENA, YOU'RE EVICTED FROM
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

02:03.524 --> 02:07.395
>> AFTER PAUL CONFRONTED MARK
ABOUT JASON'S SPEECH --

02:07.428 --> 02:12.866
>> YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WHO SAID
YOU WANT TO MAKE A BIG MOVE?

02:12.900 --> 02:13.367
>> YEAH.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.269
>> AND TIM BIG MOVE?

02:15.303 --> 02:16.136
>> YEAH.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.172
>> MARK NEW IT WAS HIM VERSUS
THE HOUSE.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.909
>> YOU MADE MOVES IN THIS GAME.

02:21.942 --> 02:25.012
YOU PUT ME UNDER THE BUS.

02:25.045 --> 02:28.316
>> "BIG BROTHER" LEGEND DEREK
SURPRISED THE HOUSE GUESTS.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.519
>> HI!
>> AND LET THEM KNOW HE WAS

02:31.552 --> 02:34.087
THERE FOR A VERY IMPORTANT JOB.

02:34.121 --> 02:37.191
>> I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO HOST THE
HOH.

02:37.225 --> 02:40.594
>> TONIGHT WITH THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD BACK UP FOR GRABS, WHO

02:40.628 --> 02:45.065
WILL RISE TO POWER AND WHICH
HOUSE GUEST WILL BE TARGETED FOR

02:45.098 --> 02:45.933
EVICTION?

02:45.966 --> 02:51.138
PLUS, A NEW TEMPTING TWIST COMES
TO LIFE.

02:51.171 --> 02:55.142
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

02:55.175 --> 02:56.210
>> I CALLED IT.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.246
>> HUSH!
>> OKAY.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.361
>> HOUSE GUESTS, THE POWER IS UP
FOR GRABS.

03:47.395 --> 03:51.332
JASON, AS OUTGOING HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE

03:51.365 --> 03:52.600
TO COMPETE.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.703
THIS WILL BE PLAYED TOURNAMENT
STYLE WITH HEAD-TO-HEAD MATCHES.

03:55.736 --> 04:02.876
IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE TRUTH,
YOU HAVE TO DECODE HIDDEN

04:02.910 --> 04:04.077
INFORMATION.

04:04.111 --> 04:08.982
IN EACH MATCH, TWO PLAYERS WILL
STEP UP AND WATCH WHILE THE

04:09.016 --> 04:11.552
ENSCRIPTED INCLUDE IS REVEALED.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.788
THE ANSWER TO EACH CLUE IS AN
EVICTED HOUSE GUEST.

04:14.822 --> 04:18.158
THE FIRST PLAYER TO HIT THE
BUTTON AND GETS THE CORRECT

04:18.191 --> 04:21.462
ANSWER, THEIR OPPONENT WILL BE
ELIMINATED.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.532
ANSWER INCORRECTLY, YOU'LL BE
ELIMINATED AND YOUR OPPONENT

04:24.565 --> 04:25.566
WILL ADVANCE.

04:25.599 --> 04:30.904
THE LAST PLAYER LEFT IS THE NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

04:30.938 --> 04:35.142
BEFORE WE BEGIN, LET'S FILL IN
THE BRACKET.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.143
RAVEN.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.580
LET'S SEE WHO SHE WILL FACE IN
THE FIRST ROUND.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.782
MARK.

04:41.815 --> 04:45.319
>> WITH CODY AND ELENA GETTING
EVICTED, THE ONLY PERSON I CAN

04:45.353 --> 04:46.520
COUNT ON NOW IS MYSELF.

04:46.554 --> 04:52.826
IF I DON'T WIN THIS HOH, IT'S
HIGHLY LIKELY I'LL BE JOINING

04:52.860 --> 04:54.194
THEM NEXT WEEK.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.329
>> PAUL.

04:55.363 --> 04:59.299
>> CODY AND ELENA ARE GONE.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.034
MARK IS STILL IN THE HOUSE.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.836
HIS AGENDA IS TO GET ME OUT.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.440
I REALLY WANT TO WIN TO KEEP
MYSELF SAFE OR I HAVE TO HAVE A

05:06.474 --> 05:11.311
CLOSE ALLY WIN THE HOH.
>> FACING OFF AGAINST PAUL WILL

05:11.345 --> 05:14.081
BE ALEX.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.249
>> I'M WORRIED BECAUSE CODY AND
ELENA ARE GONE.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.352
WITH NINE PEOPLE LEFT, WE'RE
GOING TO START GOING AGAINST

05:18.386 --> 05:19.787
EACH OTHER.

05:19.820 --> 05:25.158
SINCE JASON CAN'T COMPETE, I
NEED TO WIN IT FOR THE BOTH OF

05:25.192 --> 05:25.859
US.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.162
>> CHRISTMAS WILL TAKE ON KEVIN.

05:29.196 --> 05:34.301
JOSH WILL BE TAKING ON MATT.

05:34.334 --> 05:34.668
ALL RIGHT.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.335
FIRST MATCH.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.638
IT'S RAVEN VERSUS MARK.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.206
>> COME ON, GUYS.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.274
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.

05:41.308 --> 05:49.983
HERE'S YOUR FIRST ENCRYPTED
CLUE.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.454
>> I'M LOOKING AT THIS BIG
SCREEN.

05:53.487 --> 05:58.859
I'M SEEING TWO Ts, AN S AND
TRYING TO THINK TO PUT WORDS

05:58.892 --> 06:00.360
TOGETHER.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.396
BITTEN BY SNAKE.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.566
IT WAS RAMSEY.
>> RAVEN IS FIRST TO RING IN

06:05.599 --> 06:07.701
WITH RAMSES.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.202
>> COME ON, MARK.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.671
>> BITTEN BY SNAKE.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.808
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS RAMSES.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.276
CONGRATULATIONS, RAVEN.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.580
YOU ADVANCE TO THE NEXT ROUND.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.382
UNFORTUNATELY, MARK, 85 BEEN
ELIMINATED.

06:22.416 --> 06:25.619
>> HEARING THE HOUSE ERUPT, IT'S
PUTTING THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE OF

06:25.653 --> 06:27.621
WHERE I STAND IN THE HOUSE RIGHT
NOW.

06:27.655 --> 06:31.792
>> RAVEN BEATS MARK, THE SINGLE
BIGGEST TARGET IN THE HOUSE, SHE

06:31.825 --> 06:34.695
MEANS HE'S ELIMINATED AND CANNOT
BE HOH.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.197
I'M BEYOND ECSTATIC.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.466
SO PROUD OF RAVEN.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.232
>> ALL RIGHT.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.901
TIME FOR THE SECOND MATCH.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.135
PAUL VERSUS ALEX.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.138
ALL RIGHT.

06:45.172 --> 06:55.248
HERE'S YOUR ENCRYPTED CLUE.

06:55.282 --> 06:58.351
>> I SEE TWO Ps POP UP AND THEY
GO AWAY.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.755
AND THEN A B NEAR IT AND THEN AN
A POPS UP.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.092
I'M THINKING THIS WORD IS
BATTLE.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.894
CODY IN THE BATTLE BY CHAMPION.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.564
>> PAUL IS FIRST TO RING IN WITH
CODY.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.666
ONE BATTLE BACK SHOW DOWN.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.069
HE IS CORRECT WITH CODY.

07:16.103 --> 07:16.837
CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.238
YOU'VE MOVED ON TO THE NEXT
ROUND.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.476
I'M SORRY, ALEX, YOU'VE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

07:22.510 --> 07:23.811
>> AT LEAST I LOST TO PAUL.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.779
I HOPE PAUL WINS.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.648
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH
HIM.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.850
HE WILL KEEP AND JASON AND I
SAFE.

07:29.883 --> 07:33.020
>> UP NEXT, CHRISTMAS AND KEVIN.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.122
>> I CAME HERE TO MAKE BIG
MOVES.

07:35.155 --> 07:39.359
IN ORDER TO DO THAT, I NEED TO
WIN HOH.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.994
>> GOOD LUCK, CHRISTMAS.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.732
>> I HAVE TO WIN THIS ONE TO
SHOW THAT I CAN STAY IN THE GAME

07:44.765 --> 07:46.333
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.735
I'M DOING GOOD SOCIALLY.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.969
I HAVE TO WIN THIS HOH.

07:49.002 --> 07:59.713
>> LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR
ENCRYPTED CLUE.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.782
>> I'M LOOKING UP AT THE
MONITOR.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.316
I SEE A T FLASH, A.

08:03.350 --> 08:07.254
>> FLASH AND THEN FINALLY IN THE
MIDDLE, AND I.

08:07.287 --> 08:13.594
THEN I'M GOING, IT HAS TO BE
TIJUANA.

08:13.627 --> 08:17.765
IT HAS TO BE JILLIAN BECAUSE SHE
HAS A TATTOO.

08:17.798 --> 08:21.835
>> CHRISTMAS IS FIRST TO RING IN
ANSWERING JILLIAN.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.237
TIJUANA TATTOO.

08:24.271 --> 08:24.905
CHRISTMAS IS CORRECT.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.640
WILL BE ADVANCING.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.575
KEVIN, SORRY.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.142
YOU'VE BEEN ELIMINATED.

08:29.176 --> 08:29.843
>> ALL RIGHT.

08:29.877 --> 08:30.544
NEXT UP.

08:30.578 --> 08:31.645
IT'S JOSH VERSUS MATT.

08:31.679 --> 08:39.920
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR CLUE.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.522
>> I'M LOOKING UP AT THE SCREEN.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.257
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

08:44.291 --> 08:48.829
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF LETTERS
AND NOTHING PUT TOGETHER.

08:48.862 --> 08:55.335
OUT OF NOWHERE, I REMEMBERED
ABOUT THE HEX.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.205
JESS MADE A BIG MISTAKE BY USING
IT.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.339
SO JESS IS MY CHOICE.

08:59.372 --> 09:05.478
>> JOSH IS FIRST TO RING IN
ANSWERING JESSICA.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.546
HALTING HEX HOLDER.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.281
JOSH, YOU ARE CORRECT WITH
JESSICA.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.984
JOSH WILL BE ADVANCING.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.354
SORRY, MATT, YOU'VE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.190
DOWN TO FOUR PLAYERS.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.259
RAVEN, PAUL, CHRISTMAS AND JOSH.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.694
RAVEN AND PAUL, STEP UP.

09:20.728 --> 09:29.670
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR
ENCRYPTED CLUE.

09:29.703 --> 09:33.841
>> SO I SEE AND N, A V AND AN E
AND AN R.

09:33.874 --> 09:38.078
SO I'M THINKING THAT STANDS FOR
NEVER AND THEN I SEE A P AND AN

09:38.111 --> 09:38.545
L.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.713
AND THE WORD HOH.

09:39.747 --> 09:44.051
SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND
GUESS THAT THIS SAYS NEVER

09:44.084 --> 09:46.854
PLAYED AN HOH.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.721
CAMERON?

09:47.755 --> 09:50.123
>> PAUL IS FIRST TO RING IN WITH
CAMERON.

09:50.157 --> 09:54.862
NEVER PLAYED AN HOH.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.230
YOU ARE CORRECT WITH CAMERON.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.300
SORRY, RAVEN, YOU'VE BEEN
ELIMINATED FROM THE TOURNAMENT.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.568
>> HAPPY FOR PAUL.

10:01.601 --> 10:06.539
ON THE OTHER HAND, I WANTED TO
WIN HOH BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THIS

10:06.573 --> 10:10.443
HOUSE CAN TELL IT IN YOUR FACE,
YOU'RE SAFE, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW

10:10.477 --> 10:11.645
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.279
IT'S "BIG BROTHER."

10:12.312 --> 10:15.015
>> CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.549
YOU'LL GO TO THE FINAL ROUND.

10:16.583 --> 10:21.221
UP NEXT TO SEE WHO WILL FACE
PAUL, IT'S CHRISTMAS VERSUS

10:21.254 --> 10:21.955
JOSH.

10:21.989 --> 10:25.058
>> YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

10:25.092 --> 10:34.367
>> HERE'S YOUR CLUE.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.937
>> I'M LOOKING UP AT THE BOARD.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.339
I SEE FIRST ELIMINATED
IMMEDIATELY.

10:39.372 --> 10:43.443
NOW I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE
THIRD LINE.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.747
SO AS SOON AS I SEE IT, I SMACK
IT.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.117
I KNOW THAT ELENA WAS THE FIRST
ONE OUT.

10:50.150 --> 10:55.622
>> CHRISTMAS WAS FIRST TO RING
IN WITH ELENA.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.725
FIRST ELIMINATED.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.692
SHE'S CORRECT.

10:58.726 --> 11:02.095
CHRISTMAS, CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU'RE MOVING ON.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.865
JOSH, YOU'VE BEEN ELIMINATED
FROM THE TOURNAMENT.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.733
IT'S THE FINAL ROUND.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.001
CHRISTMAS VERSUS PAUL.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.770
WHEN IS THE NEXT HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD?

11:09.803 --> 11:13.907
>> LAST ROUND OF THE COMPETITION
AND I OBVIOUSLY WANT TO WIN SO

11:13.941 --> 11:15.709
BAD, I CAME HERE TO PLAY HARD.

11:15.743 --> 11:19.279
WHICH MEANS I'M GOING TO MAKE
BIG, BUT STRATEGIC MOVES.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.113
>> ALL RIGHT.

11:20.147 --> 11:26.053
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FINAL
CLUE.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.856
>> THIS WEEK IS A REALLY PIVOTAL
WEEK.

11:28.889 --> 11:33.526
DO I WANT TO BE ELIGIBLE TO PLAY
IN THE NEXT HOH AND KEEP MY SAFE

11:33.560 --> 11:34.427
NEXT WEEK?

11:34.461 --> 11:35.662
ABSOLUTELY YES.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.265
SO WHY NOT JUST TOSS IT TO MY
HOME GIRL, CHRISTMAS WHO IS NOT

11:38.298 --> 11:44.471
GOING TO PUT ME UP AND I GET TO
SIT BACK AND RELAX.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.606
WHO WANTS HOH?

11:46.639 --> 11:47.775
OBVIOUSLY JESSICA.

11:47.808 --> 11:52.512
I'LL JUST WAIT FOR CHRISTMAS TO
HIT THE RIGHT BUTTON AND

11:52.545 --> 11:55.816
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.485
CHRISTMAS, HIT THE RIGHT BUTTON.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.220
I DON'T HAVE ALL NIGHT HERE.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.690
THIS IS STARTING TO LOOK REALLY
OBVIOUS.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.127
CAN YOU HIT, JESSICA?

12:07.160 --> 12:10.030
I'M NOT QUITE SURE IF CHRISTMAS
EVEN KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THIS,

12:10.063 --> 12:14.768
SO BEFORE SHE BOTCHES IT AND
ANSWERS INCORRECTLY, I'M GOING

12:14.802 --> 12:18.138
TO ANSWER CAMERON BECAUSE SHE
WASN'T EVEN HERE.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.374
>> PAUL IS FIRST TO RING IN WITH
CAMERON.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.778
FOURTH HOH, THE CORRECT ANSWER
IS JESSICA.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.847
I'M SORRY, PAUL.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.614
THAT'S WRONG.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.650
CHRISTMAS, CONGRATULATIONS.

12:30.683 --> 12:43.563
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.234
>> THAT'S HOH!
KEY.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.137
I CAN'T HOLD THIS UP.

12:50.170 --> 12:55.208
I WON!
EVEN IF PAUL GAVE ME THE HOH,

12:55.242 --> 12:56.576
IT'S MY HOH.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.914
I'M READY TO DO A BIG MOVE AND
ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE 500 K

13:00.948 --> 13:03.783
THAT I CAME HERE FOR.

13:03.817 --> 13:07.554
WOO WOO!
>> EVEN THOUGH I SURVIVED THIS

13:07.587 --> 13:10.357
DOUBLE EVICTION, I LOST CODY AND
ELENA.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.159
THE TWO CLOSEST PEOPLE IN THE
HOUSE.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.261
CHRISTMAS WINS HOH.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.597
THERE'S NO DOUBT SHE WANTS TO
SEE ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.500
>> THESE PEOPLE ARE SAVAGES.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.768
THEY WAIT TILL THEY SMELL BLOOD
AND ATTACK.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.237
I'M NOT GIVING UP YET.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.618
>> WHY CAN'T YOU SHUT UP?

13:38.651 --> 13:44.824
>> OH!
>> BREAKING MY FOOT WEEK TWO OF

13:44.858 --> 13:49.096
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE JUST
HEART WRENCHING.

13:49.129 --> 13:53.300
NOW I AM JUST SO REJUVENATED
WITH ENERGY AND FIGHT AND FURY.

13:53.333 --> 13:59.907
I HAVE TO GET SOME REST BECAUSE
I HAVE SOME HARD WORK TO DO.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.343
>> I'M SO HAPPY THAT MY GIRL,
CHRISTMAS, WINS HOH.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.711
SHE'S BEEN GUNNING FOR IT.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.214
SHE'S BEEN WANTING IT FOR A LONG
TIME.

14:07.247 --> 14:11.384
WE GOT CODY OUT AND ELENA IN THE
DOUBLE ELIMINATION.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.686
NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET MARK OUT.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.023
THIS WEEK, THE PLAN IS SIMPLE.

14:16.056 --> 14:16.924
GUN FOR MIKE.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.059
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T WIN THE
VETO.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.560
HE'S AT THE DOOR.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.163
DEUCES, BUDDY.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.331
YOU PLAY YOURSELF.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.099
>> THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY TO
THESE PEOPLE.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.000
I'M TARGET NUMBER 1.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.736
THE HOUSE KNOWS I'M A
COMPETITOR.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.638
I HAVE FOUR WINS UNDER MY BELT.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.108
I'M NOT GOING HOME WITHOUT A
FIGHT.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.244
>> THE TARGET THIS WEEK IS
MARCH.

14:37.277 --> 14:40.513
IF FOR WHATEVER REASON WE CAN'T
GET MARK, I THINK KEVIN SHOULD

14:40.547 --> 14:42.115
BE THE BACKUP TARGET.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.717
KEVIN IS TOTALLY SHADY.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.155
LAST WEEK WE CAUGHT HIM TRYING
TO CUT SIDE DEALS WITH CODY.

14:48.188 --> 14:51.391
I WANT CHRISTMAS TO KNOW WHAT
KIND OF PERSON KEVIN IS SO SHE

14:51.424 --> 14:59.032
CAN PUT HIM ON HER RADAR
HERSELF.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.701
>> I DON'T LIKE KEVIN.

15:01.734 --> 15:06.606
HE KEPT SAYING LIKE --
>> WHEN CODY WAS IN THE HOUSE, I

15:06.639 --> 15:14.281
NOTICED KEVIN WAS BEING SKETCHY.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.316
>> YOU KNOW, BACK HOME, I MET
HIM IN BOSTON.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.755
LIKE SEEING SOMEBODY FROM BACK
HOME MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.057
DEREK MADE ME FEEL GOOD.

15:24.091 --> 15:29.396
>> IT MIGHT BE FAR-FETCHED, BUT
I'M THINKING THAT DEREK IS A

15:29.429 --> 15:29.997
COP.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.898
DEREK IS A POLICE OFFICER.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.302
HE HAS ALL OF THESE KNOWLEDGE
LIKE JAIL AND GANGSTER THINGS.

15:35.335 --> 15:40.273
WHAT BETTER PERSON TO KNOW THAT
THAN A COP.

15:40.307 --> 15:44.011
>> KEVIN IS PROBABLY AN
UNDERCOVER COP OR SOMETHING.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.145
HE KNEW ABOUT DEREK.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.448
>> I THINK HE'S UNDERCOVER, TOO.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.718
>> THAT'S WHY HE KNOWS ABOUT THE
GANGSTER AND --

15:51.751 --> 15:58.091
>> HE KNOWS ALL OF THAT STUFF.

15:58.125 --> 16:02.595
>> I NEED SOME --
>> CAN WE TALK?

16:02.629 --> 16:11.771
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK IN
PRIVATE, KEVIN.

16:11.804 --> 16:18.545
>> I DON'T WANT A CONVERSATION
WITH HIM.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.580
>> I'M LEAVING.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.814
>> JASON?

16:21.848 --> 16:28.088
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ONE MORE
TIME, YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT

16:28.121 --> 16:29.089
THIS MAN.

16:29.122 --> 16:29.422
HE'S SHADY.

16:29.456 --> 16:34.527
>> HE IS.

16:34.561 --> 16:35.995
EVERYTHING HE SAYS IS A LIE.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.531
>> I REALLY THOUGHT I COULD
TRUST KEVIN.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.799
I STILL FEEL LIKE I CAN.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.702
BUT I ALSO WANT THE $500,000.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.738
AND I'M NOT GOING TO SCREW THAT
UP.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.408
I MEAN, ALEX IS MY RIDE OR DIE.

16:48.441 --> 16:54.947
IF SHE THINKS HE'S SKETCHY, I'M
GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP SHIP.

16:54.981 --> 17:03.823
IT SUCKS.
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM OUT.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.959
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

17:06.993 --> 17:11.564
>> WE STILL STAND BY THE SAME
THING, RIGHT?

17:11.598 --> 17:14.967
>> YEAH, WHAT DID YOU SAY TO
ALEX?

17:15.001 --> 17:16.069
>> DID I SAY SOMETHING?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.804
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.472
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:19.506 --> 17:23.876
>> OUT OF NOWHERE, IT'S LIKE
KEVIN IS A  LIAR.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.145
>> I DIDN'T TALK TO HER.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.713
I'M GOING TO CONFRONT HER.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.248
IT'S GOING TO GET UGLY.

17:28.281 --> 17:32.685
SHE DON'T LIKE ME BECAUSE OF
SOME REASON.

17:32.719 --> 17:36.489
>> WHAT ABOUT --
>> I NEVER LIED NOTHING.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.957
I NEVER SAID NOTHING.

17:37.990 --> 17:38.991
>> I'M LIKE WHAT?

17:39.025 --> 17:40.960
>> WE JUST DON'T LIKE EACH
OTHER.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.095
THAT'S THAT.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.062
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.063
IT'S A  LIE.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.332
>> I'M WITH YOU.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.766
I KNOW HOW SHE GETS.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.536
SHE GETS WOUND UP.
>> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.338
BACK DOWN?

17:51.371 --> 17:52.772
>> SHE'S MAD.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.174
WE'LL WORRY ABOUT IT LATER.

17:54.207 --> 17:57.244
BUT WE HAVE TO CLEAN THEM.
>> WHEN ALEX AND KEVIN FIGHT, I

17:57.277 --> 17:59.045
CAN'T STAND IT.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.382
I WANT ALEX TO RELAX AND SEE
WHERE HE'S COMING FROM AND I

18:02.415 --> 18:06.586
WANT HIM TO RELAX AND UNDERSTAND
THAT HE IS THE ONE AGGRAVATING

18:06.619 --> 18:07.520
HER.

18:07.554 --> 18:11.258
>> WHATEVER IT IS, WE HAVE TO
FIGURE IT OUT.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.526
I CAN'T HAVE MY PARTNER BLOWING
UP.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.829
>> WHAT DID I LIE ABOUT THIS
TIME?

18:16.863 --> 18:22.068
>> WE'LL FIND OUT.

18:22.101 --> 18:27.006
>> I TOLD HIM THAT --
>> YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.675
YOU'RE TALKING TOO MUCH.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.843
>> BECAUSE I'M CUTTING ON HIM.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.012
>> NO.

18:33.045 --> 18:37.083
HE SAID YOU CANNOT DO -- DO NOT
SAVE MY NAME.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.019
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS ANNOYING
HER.

18:40.052 --> 18:40.753
>> WHY, WHY?

18:40.787 --> 18:44.357
>> HE'S GOING TO GET UPSET.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.227
WHY WOULD YOU TELL HIM?

18:47.260 --> 18:49.262
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM
NOTHING.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.563
>> WHY IS THAT?

18:50.597 --> 18:53.099
>> HE MUST KNOW.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.069
HE'S ALSO A COP.

18:57.103 --> 19:01.040
>> WOW.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.310
>> IT'S MY FAULT.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.878
>> OKAY.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.480
KEVIN, STOP ACTING THAT WAY.

19:07.514 --> 19:11.551
IT ANNOYS ME.
>> KEVIN CONFRONTS ME.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.653
I CAN'T LET HIM KNOW THE TRUE
REASON.

19:13.686 --> 19:17.224
I JUST BRING HIM SOME STUPID
LITTLE THING THAT ANNOYS HIM TO

19:17.257 --> 19:19.759
GET HIM OFF MY BACK FOR NOW.

19:19.792 --> 19:25.131
>> STOP ASKING ME IF YOU CAN EAT
OR NOT.

19:25.164 --> 19:31.571
>> YOU'RE IGNORING YOU.
>> SO THAT GOT YOU THAT MAD?

19:31.604 --> 19:36.876
>> STOP ASKING ME --
>> IS EVERYTHING ELSE GOOD?

19:36.909 --> 19:38.010
>> YEAH.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.513
I'M TRYING TO ASK YOU --
>> ARE YOU SQUEEZING MY HAND?

19:40.547 --> 19:41.948
>> YES.

19:41.981 --> 19:42.949
I'M IRRITATED.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.017
DO NOT ASK ME ABOUT FOOD.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.319
>> ANYTHING ELSE?

19:46.353 --> 19:47.987
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.990
>> PEOPLE GET DRAMATIC OVER
STUPID .

19:51.023 --> 19:52.692
>> SO EVERYTHING IS FINE?

19:52.725 --> 19:54.861
>> YES.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.829
THANK GOD FINALLY.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.765
>> I'M SO HAPPY YOU WON, GIRL.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.701
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.035
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.638
>> LET'S CHAT.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.408
>> I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT KEVIN.

20:08.441 --> 20:17.317
>> THE WHOLE JASON AND ALEX
THING, HOW CODY CALLED THEM OUT,

20:17.350 --> 20:20.253
I'M KIND OF BUYING INTO IT.

20:20.287 --> 20:24.357
>> CODY DROPPED A BOMB IN DOUBLE
EVICTION THAT ALEX AND JASON

20:24.391 --> 20:26.426
WERE TRYING TO FLIP THE HOUSE
AGAINST PAUL.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.629
>> ALEX, YOU PLAYED A DIRTY GAME
THIS WEEK.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.197
HER AND JASON.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.965
THEY TRIED TO FLIP THE HOUSE.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.767
THEY CAME AT ME WITH TWO
DIFFERENT PLANS.

20:34.801 --> 20:40.006
ONE TO GET ME OUT AND THE OTHER
IS TO GET YOU OUT, PAUL.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.241
>> I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT JASON.

20:42.275 --> 20:46.779
I SEEN HIM BUDDY BUDDY WITH MARK
IN THE KITCHEN, EVERYWHERE

20:46.813 --> 20:48.047
TOGETHER.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.983
JASON BLEW UP HIS OWN SPOT WHEN
HE SAID HE HAD ME ON THE FENCE

20:51.017 --> 20:52.251
THIS WEEK.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.021
>> MARK, WHEN I WAS SERIOUS ON
THE FENCE, YOU SAID IF WE DON'T

20:55.054 --> 20:59.826
MAKE A BIG MOVE NOW, WE'RE NEVER
GOING TO GET HIM OUT.

20:59.859 --> 21:07.567
>> WHY WOULD JASON SAY I WAS ON
THE FENCE THIS WEEK TO MARK?

21:07.600 --> 21:13.573
I THINK JASON AND ALEX WERE
SERIOUSLY ON THE FENCE.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.542
WHY DID HE DO THAT?

21:15.575 --> 21:20.380
WHY IS HE PLAYING WITH MARK?

21:20.413 --> 21:21.213
>> WHY?

21:21.247 --> 21:26.218
>> WHY DID YOU WANT TO TARGET US
THREE?

21:26.252 --> 21:28.421
THEN HIS SPEECH.

21:28.455 --> 21:37.997
HE'S NOT SMART WITH HIS WORDS.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.032
HE AND JASON ARE REALLY GOOD
LIARS.

21:52.345 --> 21:56.082
>> HEY, EVERYBODY!
WHO WANTS TO SEE MY EGG BASKET?

21:56.115 --> 22:03.490
>> SO I WON HOH IN THE DOUBLE
EVICTION.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.795
I REALLY WANTED THE BASKET AND
MY LETTER AND THE PICTURES OF MY

22:08.828 --> 22:10.029
FAMILY.
>> COME ON, BUDDY.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.297
YOU GOT THIS.

22:11.330 --> 22:16.636
>> FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO
TELL YOU, HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU.

22:16.669 --> 22:23.175
THE LOVE FROM YOUR HOMETOWN, THE
VOLUNTEERS VOLUNTEERING TO HELP

22:23.209 --> 22:26.112
MY FAMILY IS WITHOUT WORDS.

22:26.145 --> 22:30.216
THE KIDS ARE PAINTING THEIR
FACES.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.751
>> AWESOME.

22:31.784 --> 22:35.154
>> THE HOMESTEAD IS RUNNING
SMOOTH.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.257
DON'T WORRY.

22:38.290 --> 22:42.094
WE MISS YOU SO MUCH AND CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE YOU.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.797
WE'LL NEVER LEAVE FOR FOUR
MONTHS EVER AGAIN.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.468
ONLY WONDERING WHERE HIS
SIDEKICK WENT.

22:48.501 --> 22:53.139
GALAAN WANTS TO TELL YOU VIEW TO
WIN "BIG BROTHER" BECAUSE HE

22:53.172 --> 22:54.306
WILL BE BIG BROTHER.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.309
>> HE'S HAVING A BABY.

22:57.343 --> 23:05.852
>> OH, BUDDY!
CONGRATULATIONS.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.121
>> WOO!
>> OH, MY GOSH.

23:09.155 --> 23:16.596
>> TO FIND OUT YOU'RE GOING TO
BE A DAD FOR THE SECOND TIME IN

23:16.629 --> 23:24.504
AN EXTREME LEOTARD IS A ONCE IN
A LIFETIME MOMENT.

23:24.537 --> 23:28.374
>> YEAH!
YEAH!

23:28.407 --> 23:32.378
>> HE'S GOING TO BE A BIG
BROTHER.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.146
THERE HE IS.

23:34.180 --> 23:38.885
GATLIN AND HIS -- WELL, HIS
SISTER OR HIS BROTHER.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.019
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

23:40.052 --> 23:54.100
YEAH!
>> IT'S DEFINITELY A BOY.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.535
YES!
YES!

23:55.568 --> 24:01.841
>> I LOVE MY FAMILY SO MUCH MORE
RIGHT NOW THAN I EVER HAVE AND I

24:01.874 --> 24:03.976
DIDN'T EVEN THINK THAT WAS
POSSIBLE.

24:04.010 --> 24:08.447
I WISH I COULD SEE THEM.

24:08.481 --> 24:12.151
BUT IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.988
IT'S SUCH A DRIVING FACTOR TO
MAKE BIG MOVES AND MAKE SURE I

24:16.022 --> 24:18.791
MAKE IT TO THE END MORE THAN
EVER NOW.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.226
>> HE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.928
I NEVER SEEN HIM WHEN YOU WERE
LITTLE.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.796
BUT THAT WOULD BE IT.

24:23.830 --> 24:27.333
>> YOU HAVE TO WIN BIG BRO
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE A BIG

24:27.366 --> 24:28.034
BRO.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.137
>> YOU ALREADY WON BIG BRO THEN.

24:31.170 --> 24:43.950
>> OH, DANG!
>> SO YOU'RE GOING TO HATE ME,

24:43.983 --> 24:45.818
BUT ALL WE GOT IS FAKE EGGS.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.887
>> I DON'T HATE YOU FOR NOTHING.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.488
>> THANK YOU, JOSH.

24:49.522 --> 24:54.193
>> WEEK ONE, JOSH WAS LOSING HIS
MIND.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.896
I JUST KEPT COMFORTING HIM.

24:56.929 --> 25:00.266
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> DANG.

25:00.299 --> 25:00.867
THANK YOU, JOSH.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.101
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

25:02.134 --> 25:08.608
>> I'VE BEEN THERE FOR JOSH AND
HE IS BEING THERE FOR ME NOW.

25:08.641 --> 25:12.478
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET UPSET --
>> DON'T GET UPSET.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.713
>> IT'S FINE.

25:13.746 --> 25:17.483
>> TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT COMES
IN AND SAYS HEY, I SEE YOU'RE

25:17.516 --> 25:20.920
STRUGGLING, I SEE YOU'RE
FRUSTRATED BUT YOU'RE STILL AN

25:20.953 --> 25:22.855
AMAZING COMPETITOR, IT FEELS
GOOD.

25:22.889 --> 25:27.026
SO I'M GOING TO PULL FOR HIM.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.427
I WANT HIM THERE FOR ME.

25:28.460 --> 25:33.666
>> I DON'T THINK THAT YOU
REALIZE YOU ARE THE STRONGEST

25:33.700 --> 25:34.533
GIRL.

25:34.567 --> 25:39.071
SO YOU WILL GO WITH ME TO THE
TOP THREE.

25:39.105 --> 25:43.009
>> CHRISTMAS HAS BEEN LIKE A BIG
SISTER FOR ME IN THIS HOUSE.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.511
I WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE
THAN ME AND THAT GIRL IN THE

25:45.544 --> 25:46.579
FINAL TWO.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.081
WE'VE WORKED SO HASH AND BEEN
THROUGH HELL AND BACK.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.584
ME AND HER BOTH DESERVE TO WIN
THIS GAME.

25:51.618 --> 25:54.687
>> THANKS FOR BELIEVING IN ME.
>> THANKS FOR CHOOSING ME.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.455
>> THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING ME.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.958
THANK YOU FOR STANDING BY MY
CRAZY ASS.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.593
>> ABSOLUTELY.

26:00.627 --> 26:01.460
I LOVE IT.

26:01.493 --> 26:02.962
OH, MAN.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.598
>> YOU'RE THE BEST.

26:05.632 --> 26:13.806
>> THANK YOU.

26:13.840 --> 26:17.009
>> DUDE, WE'RE SO GOOD RIGHT
NOW.

26:17.043 --> 26:20.046
>> DO YOU SEE WHY I THREW IT?

26:20.079 --> 26:24.350
NEXT WEEK, WE ALL COMPETE, I CAN
BEAT THEM.

26:24.383 --> 26:24.917
TRUST ME.

26:24.951 --> 26:26.152
TRUST ME.

26:26.185 --> 26:31.423
>> EVERY WEEK IN THIS GAME, YOUR
BOY HAS BEEN WORKING NONSTOP

26:31.457 --> 26:34.927
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY VET IN THE
HOUSE.

26:34.961 --> 26:39.131
FROM THE MOMENT I'VE WALKED IN,
HAD TO PLAY "BIG BROTHER" ON

26:39.165 --> 26:44.737
FULL OVERDRIVE.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.405
>> IT'S HUGE, DUDE.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.407
>> IT'S HUGE.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.476
>> WE CAN FINAGLE IT.

26:50.509 --> 26:51.878
WE HAVE TO GET KEVIN OUT.

26:51.911 --> 26:56.582
>> SO I'VE TAKEN A STEP BACK AND
REALIZED THAT THERE'S THREE

26:56.615 --> 26:57.717
POWER DUOS.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.487
ALEX AND JASON, MATT AND RAVEN
AND CHRISTMAS AND JOSH.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.556
>> IT'S MARK, WE HAVE TO GET HIM
OUT.

27:04.590 --> 27:07.760
>> I HAVE TO ATTACH MYSELF TO
EACH POWER COUPLE.

27:07.794 --> 27:08.861
>> IT'S A TEAM EFFORT.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.229
I'VE SAID THAT FROM DAY ONE.

27:10.262 --> 27:14.200
IF YOU BAN TOGETHER WITH THE
RIGHT PEOPLE AND STICK TO A

27:14.233 --> 27:17.804
PLAN, YOU GET FAR.
>> I'M BECOMING THE THIRD WITH

27:17.837 --> 27:22.508
EACH PAIR SO THEY CAN RELY ON ME
TOWARDS THE END OF THE GAME.

27:22.541 --> 27:27.546
>> I TRIED TO MAKE MYSELF YOUR
ALLY.

27:27.579 --> 27:31.383
>> IF THE POWER DUOS ARE TAKING
SHOTS AT EACH OTHER, NATURALLY

27:31.417 --> 27:36.122
I'M GOING TO FILL IN THE SPOT OF
WHOEVER THEY TAKE A SHOT AT.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.291
>> WE'RE BOUND TOGETHER NEXT
WEEK.

27:39.325 --> 27:43.529
>> YEAH.

27:43.562 --> 27:47.666
>> SO RIGHT NOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE
NUZZLED MY WAY INTO AN

27:47.700 --> 27:48.667
INTERESTING SITUATION.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.937
EACH COUPLE THINKS I'M THEIR
POWER THREE.

27:50.970 --> 27:59.111
IN EITHER SCENARIO, IF THEY
KNOCK OUT ONE, I BECOME FINAL

27:59.145 --> 28:00.646
TWO TO THE OTHER.

28:00.679 --> 28:15.294
>> YOU REALLY HAVE NOBODY ELSE
SO --

28:15.327 --> 28:16.662
>> OH, MY GOD.

28:16.695 --> 28:22.401
>> EVEN THOUGH KEVIN HAS BEEN
SKETCHY, MY PLAN IS TO BACK DOOR

28:22.434 --> 28:23.102
MARK.

28:23.135 --> 28:26.105
I NEED PAWNS IN ORDER TO
THAT.

28:26.138 --> 28:26.705
>> WHAT'S UP?

28:26.739 --> 28:39.318
>> I THINK MATT AND JASON.

28:39.351 --> 28:45.391
>> IF MATT OR JASON GETS THE
VETO, WE TAKE MATT DOWN.

28:45.424 --> 28:54.400
BUT I THINK THIS WAY WE CAN STAY
ON GOOD GRACES WITH BOTH.

28:54.433 --> 28:59.671
IT'S LIKE HEY, WE HAVE THE VOTES
TO SAVE THAT PERSON THAT IS ON

28:59.705 --> 29:00.739
THE BLOCK.

29:00.773 --> 29:04.777
>> WHAT IS PLAN B IF MARK CAN'T
GO?

29:04.811 --> 29:09.115
LIKE MARK WINS THE VETO AND
DOESN'T USE IT?

29:09.148 --> 29:11.717
>> JASON.

29:11.750 --> 29:16.923
JASON SPEECH, HE SAID I WAS
LOOKING TO PUT YOU UP LAST WEEK.

29:16.956 --> 29:21.961
SO THAT WAS -- AND JASON IS
HAVING HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS

29:21.994 --> 29:23.195
ABOUT YOU WITH MARK.

29:23.229 --> 29:23.963
>> I KNOW.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.298
I WOULD GET JASON OUT.

29:26.332 --> 29:31.603
>> WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE, ME, YOU
AND JOSH THAT ARE TIGHT.

29:31.637 --> 29:36.608
AND WE CAN KEEP KEVIN IN OUR
GROUP --

29:36.642 --> 29:37.877
>> AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:37.910 --> 29:42.849
>> I DECIDE TO TAKE ONE PERSON
FROM EACH POWER COUPLE, MATT AND

29:42.882 --> 29:48.254
RAVEN, JASON OR ALEX AND PUT
THEM ON THE BLOCK.

29:48.287 --> 29:52.324
MARK IS MY OBVIOUS TARGET BUT I
WOULDN'T BE UPSET TO BREAK UP

29:52.358 --> 29:53.292
JASON AND ALEX.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.694
>> THIS IS PERFECT FOR MY PLAN.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.964
JASON IS A BRIDGE BETWEEN ALEX
AND I.

29:57.997 --> 30:02.601
IF CHRISTMAS TAKES OUT JASON,
ALEX NO LONGER HAS JASON OF A

30:02.634 --> 30:05.104
RIGHT OR DIE AND SHE NEEDS ME TO
CONTINUE HER GAME FURTHER.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.106
SHE CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

30:07.139 --> 30:07.439
>> GOOD JOB.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.341
>> THANKS.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.888
>> WELCOME TO MY CRIB.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.256
THESE ARE ANY FOUR WALLS.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.224
THAT'S WALL NUMBER 1.

30:25.257 --> 30:28.060
LOOK AT THIS WALL.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.428
WE HAVE THE APPLES.

30:29.461 --> 30:34.133
I'VE BEEN IN THIS ROOM SO LONG,
THERE'S 355 APPLES ON THAT WALL.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.834
>> I'M GOING NUTS.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.970
I NEED SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

30:38.004 --> 30:42.308
YOUR BOY IS LOSING IT.
>> I NEED A FRIEND.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.643
IT'S MY FRIEND, THE TALKING OWL.

30:44.676 --> 30:48.180
HE'S THE COOLEST OWL ON THE
BLOCK.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.882
>> SO I MADE A FRIEND.

30:49.916 --> 30:53.953
IT'S ME IN ORWALL.

30:53.986 --> 30:58.024
WE'RE DANCING SALSA AND TALKING
SMACK ABOUT THE MEATBALLS.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.459
>> I HAD ENOUGH.
>> AND WE'RE HAVING A GREAT

31:00.492 --> 31:01.127
TIME.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.929
>> YOU HAVE ME LOOKING CRAZY.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.964
YOU TALK ABOUT THE TIME AND NOW
YOU DON'T TALK?

31:04.997 --> 31:07.599
>> I'M HAVING A BETTER TIME IN
HERE THAN OUT THERE.

31:07.633 --> 31:17.676
>> FOR HAVING A TALK SHOW, YOU
DON'T TALK MUCH, BUDDY.

31:17.676 --> 31:31.090
>> FOR HAVING A TALK SHOW, YOU
DON'T TALK MUCH, BUDDY.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.325
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

31:33.359 --> 31:37.096
>> I SEE A BUNCH OF APPLES.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.231
WHAT'S GOING ON, "BIG BROTHER"?

31:39.265 --> 31:46.472
EVERY TIME I THINK SOMETHING IS
SMOOTH IS HAPPENING, IT'S

31:46.505 --> 31:47.273
DIDN'T.

31:47.306 --> 31:55.514
WHAT ARE WE IN THE GARDEN OF
EDEN?

31:55.547 --> 32:01.553
>> WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.
>> HOUSE GUESTS, THE SUMMER OF

32:01.587 --> 32:03.822
TEMPTATION IS NOT OVER YET.

32:03.855 --> 32:06.325
THIS NEW TWIST WILL BE IN PLAY
FOR THREE WEEKS.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.427
FIVE APPLES HANG FROM THE TREE.

32:08.460 --> 32:12.064
INSIDE EACH ONE IS EITHER A
POWER OR A PUNISHMENT.

32:12.098 --> 32:20.072
YOU WILL HAVE NO IDEA IF AN
APPLE HAS A POWER OR PUNISHMENT.

32:20.106 --> 32:26.778
THE FIRST HOW GUEST TO COME TO
THE ROOM AND SAY THEY WANT AN

32:26.812 --> 32:29.581
APPLE, THEY CAN SELECT ONE FROM
THE TREE.

32:29.615 --> 32:32.551
THE TREE WILL TURN RED PRIOR TO
NOMINATION.

32:32.584 --> 32:37.956
ONCE A HOUSE GUEST CHOOSES AN
APPLE, THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE TO

32:37.990 --> 32:39.125
CHOOSE ANOTHER.

32:39.158 --> 32:44.730
IF AN APPLE IS SELECTED,
EVERYBODY HAS TO GATHER AND THE

32:44.763 --> 32:48.700
POWER OR PUNISHMENT WILL BE
REVEALED TO EVERYONE.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.970
>> YEAH!
>> SO I'M LOOKING AT THE TREE

32:52.004 --> 32:55.274
AND LOOKING AT THE PUNISHMENT
AND THE POWERS THAT IT HAS.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.676
TO BE HONEST, I DON'T LIKE THEM.

32:57.709 --> 33:02.248
HAS SAVE A FRIEND, CAN'T COMPETE
IN THE NEXT HOH, TWO VETOES,

33:02.281 --> 33:05.984
BOUNTY ON YOUR HEAD AND
ELIMINATE TWO EVICTION VOTES,

33:06.018 --> 33:09.688
THIS TWIST IS 100% GOING TO
CHANGE THE GAME.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.190
>> WOW!
>> THANK YOU.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.725
I NEEDED A TWIST.

33:13.759 --> 33:17.229
I NEED SOMETHING TO TURN THE
TABLES ON THE PEOPLE IN THIS

33:17.263 --> 33:17.796
HOUSE.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.465
THIS COULD BE MY CHANCE.

33:19.498 --> 33:26.972
>> ONCE A POWER OR PUNISHMENT IS
REVEALED, IT CAN ONLY BE USED

33:27.005 --> 33:27.873
THAT WEEK.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.841
AFTER IT'S PLAYED OUT, IT'S GONE
FOR GOOD.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.744
>> I'M LOOKING AT THIS TREE OF
TEMPTATION.

33:32.778 --> 33:36.448
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT CAN
MESS UP MY HOH AND PREVENT ME

33:36.482 --> 33:39.251
FROM SENDING MARK HOME.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.686
>> THINK LONG AND HARD.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.422
IT CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOUR GAME.

33:43.455 --> 33:50.229
>> ANOTHER TWIST AT THIS POINT
IN THE GAME?

33:50.262 --> 33:53.432
I'VE MADE IT THROUGH SOME TOUGH
SITUATIONS AND NOW I HAVE TO

33:53.465 --> 33:54.666
WORRY ABOUT A TREE.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.335
IT COULD SCREW UP THE PLANS THIS
WEEK AND THE REST OF MY GAME.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.836
>> DID YOU WATCH ADAM AND EVE?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.871
DON'T BITE THE APPLE.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.684
>> WHAT IS THIS?

34:25.997 --> 34:27.999
>> I WOULD LIKE TO CLAIM AN
APPLE.

34:31.870 --> 34:36.208
>> THEY'RE BAD!
>> DID YOU DO IT?

34:36.242 --> 34:40.011
>> YEAH.

34:40.045 --> 34:42.814
>> I KNOW IS HAPPENING WITH THE
HOUSE.

34:42.848 --> 34:47.186
>> THE ONLY THEM I'M HOPING FOR
IS THE SECOND VETO.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.356
DOUBLE MY CHANCES TO GET THE
SECOND VETO AND STAY SAFE.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.191
THERE'S BAD APPLES.

34:52.224 --> 34:55.494
I HOPE I DON'T GRAB ONE.

34:55.527 --> 35:05.504
IT WOULD MAKE MY SITUATION EVEN
WORSE.

35:05.537 --> 35:10.442
>> AN APPLE HAS BEEN PICKED FROM
THE TREE OF TEMPTATION.

35:10.476 --> 35:16.682
EVERYONE GO TO THE LIVING ROOM
WHERE THE HOLDER WILL LEARN

35:16.715 --> 35:19.718
THEIR FATE.

35:19.751 --> 35:28.927
>> GUYS, I HAVE PICKED AN APPLE.

35:28.960 --> 35:39.438
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT IS
INSIDE.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.408
>> SAVE A FRIEND.

35:42.441 --> 35:47.246
>> I GO FOR AN APPLE AND I GET
"SAVED A FRIEND."

35:47.279 --> 35:49.815
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE ANY
FRIENDS IN THE HOUSE.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.850
MAYBE I CAN SHOW YOU THIS TO MY
ADVANTAGE MOVING FORWARD.

36:06.097 --> 36:06.865
>> OKAY.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.967
>> SO MY PLAN IS TO BACK DOOR
MARK.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.938
BUT I NEED TO HAVE ONE OF EACH
POWER COUPLE UP AS PAWNS.

36:12.971 --> 36:18.043
SO AT LEAST IF I DON'T GET MARK,
I GET TO BREAK UP ANOTHER

36:18.076 --> 36:21.046
COUPLE.

36:21.079 --> 36:25.684
>> BACK-DOORING MARK IS MY
OBJECTIVE THIS WEEK.

36:25.717 --> 36:29.821
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHICH OF
YOU THAT I CAN PUT UP THAT FEELS

36:29.855 --> 36:31.757
COMFORTABLE GOING IN A
COMPETITION.

36:31.790 --> 36:38.297
I HAVE A VOTE TO KEEP YOU GUYS,
WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.400
SO WORST CASE SCENARIO, HE WINS
THE VETO.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.536
HE DOESN'T USE THE VETO.

36:44.570 --> 36:52.711
WE SENT JASON OUT.
>> TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.

36:52.744 --> 36:56.382
>> SHE DOESN'T GO UP AS A PAWN
UNDER ANY SCENARIO.

36:56.415 --> 36:59.951
I WILL GO UP.
>> 100%.

36:59.985 --> 37:07.192
>> YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED IF HE
WINS THE VETO --

37:07.225 --> 37:09.428
>> WE CAN PUT UP KEVIN.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.530
>> THIS IS MY THIRD TIME AS A
PAWN.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.598
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT FUN.

37:12.631 --> 37:15.734
AT SOME POINT, EVERYBODY WILL
HAVE TO BE A PAWN.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.738
I'M TAKING MY TURN NOW SO THAT
WAY DOWN THE LINE IT'S SOMEBODY

37:19.771 --> 37:34.152
ELSE'S TURN TO STEP UP WHEN IT'S
MORE RISKY.

37:34.185 --> 37:34.986
>> CHRISTMAS?

37:35.020 --> 37:37.188
>> YEAH.
>> WE'RE HERE, SO YOU KNOW.

37:37.222 --> 37:40.091
>> IT'S NOT AWKWARD.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.928
>> NOT AWKWARD.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.195
>> OKAY.

37:44.229 --> 37:51.937
SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO -- SIT
HERE.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.739
>> I'M GOING TO BACK DOOR MARK.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.641
I WANT TO, 100%.

37:55.674 --> 38:00.546
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
GUYS IS THAT I HAVE MATT GOING

38:00.579 --> 38:04.650
UP AS A PAWN.

38:04.683 --> 38:07.586
I WANTED TO USE ONE OF YOU.

38:07.619 --> 38:11.923
>> IF IT'S ME OR HIM AND HE
WINS --

38:11.957 --> 38:17.729
>> IF MARK WINS AND USES THE
VETO, WE SENT MATT HOME.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.665
>> HE WON'T BEAT ME.

38:19.698 --> 38:23.669
>> I DON'T MIND GOING UP AS A
PAWN.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.772
I STILL HAVE PRETTY SOLID TRUST
THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE

38:26.805 --> 38:28.907
ME OUT.
>> I WANT TO MAKE BOTH OF YOU

38:28.940 --> 38:30.108
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.544
I WILL BE DRAWING THE LINE THAT
I ABSOLUTELY WANT MARK OUT.

38:32.578 --> 38:35.514
>> MARK IS OBVIOUSLY MY TARGET
FOR THIS WEEK.

38:35.547 --> 38:39.050
HOWEVER, ONE OF MY PAWNS IS MY
SECOND TARGET, JASON.

38:39.084 --> 38:44.155
SO IF MARK WINS THE VETO AND
USES IT ON HIMSELF, THEN I GET

38:44.189 --> 38:45.657
TO SPLIT JASON AND ALEX.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.859
IT'S A WIN-WIN IF YOU ASK ME.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.896
>> YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH
THAT?

38:50.929 --> 39:02.608
>> YES.

39:02.641 --> 39:06.612
>> I'M GOING TO TALK TO JOSH AND
CHRISTMAS.

39:06.645 --> 39:10.582
IT'S MY LAST-DITCH EFFORTS TO
CHANGE THEIR MIND AND SHOW THEM

39:10.616 --> 39:11.917
I'M ALL ALONE IN THIS GAME.

39:11.950 --> 39:16.822
IF YOU WERE TO KEEP ME SAFE, I'D
BE A NUMBER MOVING FORWARD.

39:16.855 --> 39:24.162
>> I ASSUMED THAT I'M THE NUMBER
1 TARGET REGARDLESS OF WHAT

39:24.195 --> 39:25.831
WORDS ARE SAID.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.599
CLEARLY YOU'RE TOGETHER.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.901
THERE'S STRONG COUPLES IN THIS
HOUSE.

39:29.935 --> 39:33.371
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT DON'T SIT BACK, DON'T SAY

39:33.405 --> 39:34.139
ANYTHING, DON'T DO ANYTHING.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.975
I DON'T RESPECT THEM.

39:37.008 --> 39:42.981
OR THEY'RE VERY STRONG DUO.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.182
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

39:44.215 --> 39:50.422
AS MUCH AS WE FIGHT, THERE'S
JUST THIS RESPECT THAT I HAVE

39:50.456 --> 39:51.022
FOR YOU.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.391
>> JOSH, YOU SURPRISED ME.

39:53.425 --> 39:56.662
I WOULDN'T EXPECTING TO SEE FULL
CONVERSATIONS.

39:56.695 --> 39:57.996
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.498
CHRISTMAS, I AM ALONE IN THIS
GAME.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.500
I DO HAVE A SAVE A PLAYER.

40:01.533 --> 40:05.370
IF YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE, IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING, KEEP IT INTO

40:05.403 --> 40:06.104
CONSIDERATION, OKAY?

40:06.137 --> 40:06.838
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

40:06.872 --> 40:07.405
THANK YOU.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.808
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

40:09.841 --> 40:10.442
I DO.

40:10.476 --> 40:13.278
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

40:13.311 --> 40:17.516
THANK YOU.

40:17.549 --> 40:22.220
>> A LOT OF WHAT HE SAID MADE
SENSE.

40:22.253 --> 40:25.190
>> AFTER TALKING TO MARK, IF
MARK STAYED, I KNOW THAT HE

40:25.223 --> 40:31.162
WANTS TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE OUT
THE SHOWMANCE AND THE POWER

40:31.196 --> 40:32.197
COUPLE.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.465
SO SAVING MARK THIS WEEK IS
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

41:07.098 --> 41:10.502
>> THIS IS A NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.738
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE TWO

41:12.771 --> 41:15.406
HOUSE GUESTS FOR EVICTION.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.878
BEFORE I PROCEED, MARK, YOU
RECEIVED THE SAVE A FRIEND POWER

41:19.911 --> 41:24.583
FROM THE TREE OF TEMPTATION.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.618
PLEASE STAND AND REVEAL WHO
YOU'RE KEEPING SAFE.

41:26.652 --> 41:32.691
>> I'VE BEEN STICK IN THE MILDEW
TO MY OWN MISTAKES.

41:32.724 --> 41:37.395
DUE TO YOU THINK, I HAVE A
CHANCE TO PAY BACK A DEBT IN

41:37.428 --> 41:38.597
THIS GAME.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.566
PAUL, YOU GAVE ME FRIENDSHIP
WEEK ONE.

41:40.599 --> 41:44.703
THE LEAST I CAN DO, GIVE YOU
SAFETY FOR A WEEK.

41:44.736 --> 41:48.907
>> THANK YOU.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.476
>> THANK YOU, MARK.

41:51.509 --> 41:56.748
>> MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSE GUESTS I'M

41:56.782 --> 41:58.584
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

41:58.617 --> 42:01.252
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATIONS.

42:01.286 --> 42:05.056
THEIR FACES WILL APPEAR ON THE
MEMORY WALL.

42:05.090 --> 42:16.768
THE FIRST HOUSE GUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS -- THE NEXT HOUSE

42:16.802 --> 42:29.748
GUEST I HAVE NOMINATED IS --
HAVE NOMINATED YOU, MATT AND

42:38.089 --> 42:40.225
YOU, JASON.

42:40.258 --> 42:43.161
MARK, YOU'RE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE
COMPETITOR.

42:43.194 --> 42:45.330
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU ALIGNED
YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE THAT WERE

42:45.363 --> 42:47.098
TOO SELFISH IN THE GAME.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.734
I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS
MOVE.

42:48.767 --> 42:55.240
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

42:55.273 --> 42:58.009
>> THE TARGET THIS WEEK IS MARK.

42:58.043 --> 42:59.911
I DON'T MIND GOING UP AS A PAWN.

42:59.945 --> 43:03.682
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE THE VOTES TO
STAY.

43:03.715 --> 43:05.083
BUT YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

43:05.116 --> 43:09.054
>> I USED THE SAVE A FRIEND
POWER ON PAUL BECAUSE I TOLD HIM

43:09.087 --> 43:12.791
DAY ONE WHEN HE GAVE ME HIS
FRIENDSHIP BRACELET, WHEN I HAVE

43:12.824 --> 43:15.026
THE CHANCE I'LL PAY HIM BACK.

43:15.060 --> 43:18.029
HOPEFULLY IT SHOWS PEOPLE THAT
I'M TRUE TO MY WORD THAT I CAN

43:18.063 --> 43:21.599
SOMEHOW GET INTO A BETTER
POSITION MOVING FORWARD.

43:21.633 --> 43:26.271
>> MARK IS OBVIOUSLY MY BACK
DOOR TARGET.

43:26.304 --> 43:31.009
IF MARK WINS THE VETO, I'VE
NOMINATED TWO PAWNS, JASON AND

43:31.042 --> 43:32.110
MATT.

43:32.143 --> 43:34.445
IF I DON'T GET PARK, I BREAK UP
ANOTHER POWER COUPLE.

43:34.479 --> 43:36.948
>> WHO WILL WIN THE POWER OF
VETO?

43:36.982 --> 43:41.753
WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE EITHER
JASON OR MATT FROM THE BLOCK?

43:41.787 --> 43:42.921
AND SINGBOT.
