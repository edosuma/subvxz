00:15.016 --> 00:16.756
Human sashimi, anyone?

00:17.018 --> 00:19.384
I could rescue her.
So easily.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.727
Yes, yes-- you can
Chi-suck your way to victory.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.142

"no worries Bo-Bo,
you're just on a break."

you were on a date?

00:39.207 --> 00:39.946
Pff--

00:40.208 --> 00:42.164
Dating is so not
a thing anymore.

00:42.418 --> 00:43.578
It's all about group-hangs.

Wait, aren't you
in India right now?

01:36.806 --> 01:37.966
Well, I'm just checking in.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.339
Of course.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.807

a total angel tonight.

01:42.061 --> 01:43.767

Sorry, my old neighbourhood
was a little rough--

08:46.777 --> 08:48.733
And, um, we
heard screaming.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.148
Screaming just means we were
dishing about our neighbours.

to go to India.

--Good idea.
--Oh no, please...

09:19.977 --> 09:21.012
And "technically"
I'm not single--

09:21.270 --> 09:22.305
Don't worry, love,
she's already dished

09:22.563 --> 09:23.643
about your little break-up.

09:23.897 --> 09:24.932
It's more of a break.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.930
I say, if it's getting hard,
something's wrong.

09:27.192 --> 09:27.817
Hmm...

09:28.068 --> 09:29.057
I always say the opposite.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.310
If it's getting soft...
Amiright?

09:31.572 --> 09:34.154
[Laughing]

09:34.408 --> 09:35.568
I'm good at Book Club.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.442
Oh, we should totally
set Bo up with Pete,

09:38.704 --> 09:39.409
the tennis pro?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.494
Yeah, if she likes 'em
hairy and sweaty.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.408
Do you?

09:42.666 --> 09:43.325
She likes 'em all.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.120
It doesn't matter--
Pete only has eyes

09:45.377 --> 09:47.163
for Tits McGee, a.k.a. Lisa.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.206
She's our babysitter.

09:48.464 --> 09:49.579
She's very good
with the children.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.956
And she could nurse
a whole village of 'em!

09:52.217 --> 09:54.082
Well, good help is
hard to come by.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.721
No, Lisa is great, she just
has a "lively" imagination.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.132
Well, speaking
of neighbourhood men,

09:58.390 --> 10:00.130
our Peeping Tom?
Sam?

10:00.392 --> 10:01.472
Oh, you're kidding.

10:01.727 --> 10:02.967
Mmhm, he was skulking
around the Thatcher house,

10:03.228 --> 10:04.343
looking at us in the window.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.344
Gross.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.767
When Sam first moved in,
he hosted barbecues,

10:08.025 --> 10:09.140
he signed up
to coach soccer--

10:09.401 --> 10:10.777
He even fixed
my downstairs sink

10:11.028 --> 10:12.143
when Tim was out of town.

10:12.404 --> 10:12.984
But then?

10:13.238 --> 10:15.149
He started getting shifty.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.362
Keeping to himself.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.732
Sounds like somebody
you'd hear about

10:17.993 --> 10:19.278
on the six o'clock news.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.743
I heard his wife disappeared
under mysterious circumstances.

10:21.997 --> 10:22.861
She couldn't
cook anyway--

10:23.123 --> 10:24.988
Which is fine because,
creepy as Sam is,

10:25.250 --> 10:26.751
is magic with a saute pan.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.367
He's coming to
my afternoon BBQ.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.369
You guys should come too,
both of you--

10:30.631 --> 10:30.960
BOTH: Yeah!

10:31.215 --> 10:32.079
Sounds great--

10:32.341 --> 10:33.000
[Sigh]

10:33.258 --> 10:34.668
I need another Margarita.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.133
Oh, here we go--

10:36.386 --> 10:37.136
[Laughing]

10:37.387 --> 10:38.547
Eleanor? Honey?

10:38.806 --> 10:40.762
Eleanor's been like this
ever since Christmas.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.928
She lost her husband
suddenly, it was so tragic.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.968
I need to pee.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.352
I'm gonna stick around and
see if I can talk to Lisa.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.146
See if you can get
any info on Sam.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.233
Okay, any info will do.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.193
I'm on it.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.152
This kinda feels
like old times.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.567
I know, maybe we should
get new flyers made.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.362
Yeah, like, headshots.
I'm so game.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.155
Tell me what you
come up with, okay?

11:02.412 --> 11:03.572
Oh honey, absolutely.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.037
Ha, ha, ha...

11:05.541 --> 11:07.156
ljust need to take
some personal time.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.406
Okay.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.205
Honey, do you want to
talk to my spiritual advisor?

11:10.462 --> 11:12.953
You always get a little PMS-y
during the waning moon.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.580
Caroline,
I need to go away.

11:14.842 --> 11:15.752
And break up our club?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.124
No, Ellie,
we need you.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.547
What are we gonna
do about Sam?

11:20.806 --> 11:23.764
What we're not
gonna do is panic.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.639
Okay.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.304
Good.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.901
All right, all right, forget
about the particle accelerator-

11:36.154 --> 11:37.234
Did I mention to you
our state of the art

11:37.489 --> 11:38.444
Nuclear Resonance Lab?

11:38.699 --> 11:40.655
But do you have mold?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.364
Well, I am flattered from
the offer, Isaac, I am,

11:44.621 --> 11:48.079
but as I told you yesterday
and the day before--

11:48.834 --> 11:49.448
I have a job.

11:49.710 --> 11:52.326
At Ash Pharmaceuticals.
An R&D company so small,

11:52.588 --> 11:54.419
I've never heard of them--
and I've heard of everyone.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.163
So, let me
be frank with you.

11:56.425 --> 11:57.460
Everything
I've read about you

11:57.718 --> 11:59.379
implies that you're an innovator.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.922
That you're a risk taker.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.432
That you're willing
to chase after greatness.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.845
You're not a mold farmer.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.760
Goodbye, Issac.

12:11.815 --> 12:12.565
I'll call you tomorrow.

12:12.816 --> 12:13.976
Goodbye.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.107
Did you find anything?

12:20.616 --> 12:21.571
Maybe.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.565
Do you know Sam Evans?

12:23.827 --> 12:25.738
Yeah. I totally
babysit his son, Ethan.

12:25.996 --> 12:26.826
Like twice a week.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.366
Well, not anymore.
He might be dangerous.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.707
Do you know where he
goes when you babysit?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.291
No.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.160
He sort of flies solo.
Keeps to himself.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.128
Yeah, so I've heard.

12:37.883 --> 13:01.605
[Music playing]

13:08.330 --> 13:11.743
[Music playing]

13:12.000 --> 13:13.160
Lisa!

13:17.339 --> 13:18.454
How's suburbia?

13:19.424 --> 13:23.133
Oh, you know, filled
with tofu scarfing,

13:23.387 --> 13:25.753
crystal rubbing, Buddha
bumping hypocrites.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.800
Yeah, they're zen, alright--
until they get

13:28.058 --> 13:30.265
a single scratch
on their luxury SUV.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.305
People have always searched
for guidance, Kenzi.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.553
Even those who
have to commute.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.726
You get that from your
big fortune cookie book?

13:36.984 --> 13:37.973
No.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.725
But I did find a name.

13:39.987 --> 13:40.772
Hm.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.360
Sam Evans!

13:42.614 --> 13:43.569
Lisa.

13:43.824 --> 13:44.734
Lisa Allan.

13:44.992 --> 13:45.572
What?

13:45.826 --> 13:47.487
Lisa is a Duppy.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.780
A Fae spirit who
lives in the earth.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.073
And look at this:

13:51.331 --> 13:53.367
This one was reported missing
a hundred years ago.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.162
Are you telling me she's
Fae and doesn't know it?

13:56.420 --> 13:58.001
She's not just Fae.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.162
She's dead.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.664
Uh oh.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.711
Bad news usually
comes in threes.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.925
Fae, dead and...?

14:06.179 --> 14:09.046
Duppies have a very
specific calling...

14:13.979 --> 14:15.719
BO: Lisa,
what did you do?!

14:15.981 --> 14:18.017
I've done as asked.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.562
Oh, Eleanor...

14:24.740 --> 14:25.820
[Clatter!]

14:27.409 --> 14:29.070
I've done as asked.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.073
Yeah...
you mentioned that.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.455
So she's basically
a killing machine.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.795
That "brings darkness"
and can be invoked

14:42.049 --> 14:43.129
every hundred
years, yes.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.133
What a cute name.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.045
Who names
a killer "Duppy?"

14:46.303 --> 14:49.545
I don't get it: If she's dead,
what's making her... go?

14:49.806 --> 14:51.467
Duppies don't
have Chi per se.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.759
They run on the energy of those
who invoke them to kill.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.260
Lisa '5 essentially
an empty vessel.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.773
An empty vessel who cared
enough to come to us.

14:59.024 --> 14:59.934
Maybe when
she wakes up,

15:00.192 --> 15:02.353
she can tell us who's
doing this to her.

15:02.611 --> 15:03.942
My money's
on Sam Evans.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.936
There is just something
off about that guy.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.154
Duppies black out
after each kill.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.784
Lisa won't
remember a thing.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.445
Like Fae-mnesia?

15:11.703 --> 15:12.863
Exactly.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.908
If Sam is invoking
Lisa to kill people,

15:16.166 --> 15:17.121
we need proof.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.919
Where am I?

15:23.590 --> 15:24.454
Lisa, it's Bo.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.923
You're okay.
You're in a safe place.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.217
What happened?

15:31.014 --> 15:32.754
I... got it.

15:33.809 --> 15:34.798
Come on, Lisa.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.641
We'll go have a beer.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.226
Or, five.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.777
So, I kill people?

15:45.195 --> 15:46.935
And I'm dead?

15:47.197 --> 15:51.065
On the bright side--
Killer Dead Babysitter:

15:51.326 --> 15:54.033
The TV movie writes itself.

15:55.038 --> 15:55.993
Okay, bad joke.
Here...

15:56.248 --> 15:58.580
Have any one of these,
it'll take the edge off.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.119
Oh, I don't have ID.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.538
Honey, you're like
a thousand years old.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.706
I think it's kosher.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.125
I'm supposed to grow up.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.749
Be a doctor. Help people.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.875
Look, you are Fae.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.719
That makes you special.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.760
And maybe you can even
learn to control it like Bo.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.723
Control when I kill people?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.718
Where I kill people?
How I kill people?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.186
Okay, so the--

16:21.982 --> 16:23.347
--totally sucks. I get it.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.939
But it is not your fault.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.854
Somebody else is doing this.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.568
Then they can do it again.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.359
Look, Bo is going to Caroline's
BBQ to do some recon.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.731
Wait--
that's today?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.779
Oh, man, I'm supposed
to babysit Ethan.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.947
No, no, no, you gotta
stay here with Trick.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.160
And--

16:38.415 --> 16:39.780
[Whispering]
These pretty drinks.

16:40.041 --> 16:40.450
But I promised.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.448
I'll do it.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.325
It'll give me a
chance to poke around

16:43.587 --> 16:45.043
the psycho's pre-fab
home while I'm at it.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.504
Ethan is super
high maintenance.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.008
I have fought
the Garuda.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.420
I think I can handle
one ten year-old.

16:52.971 --> 16:55.758
Daddy always makes my
grilled cheese with munster!

16:56.016 --> 16:57.722
Daddy have the same
anger issues you do?

16:57.976 --> 16:59.341
It tastes like crap!

16:59.603 --> 17:02.970
I slaved over a hot microwave
making that sandwich!

17:04.024 --> 17:05.855
[Sigh] You have to eat
something, Ethan.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.144
No!

17:07.402 --> 17:09.563
Do you know what
they do to little kids

17:09.821 --> 17:10.901
who don't eat their dinner?

17:11.156 --> 17:13.772
They come after them
in the middle of the night,

17:14.034 --> 17:15.570
from closets and
under the bed.

17:15.827 --> 17:16.236
What does?

17:16.494 --> 17:17.483
Goblins!

17:17.746 --> 17:19.532
--to eat you for dinner.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.955
Oh, my god, I sound
like my mother--

17:24.002 --> 17:25.333
Okay...
Okay--

17:26.588 --> 17:28.328
Okay, let's just--
We'll start again.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.330
I will make you
a new sandwich.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.548
Just show me where
the weirdo cheese is.

17:32.802 --> 17:33.712
No! I want Lisa!

17:33.970 --> 17:35.926
And you smell
like gasoline!

17:37.807 --> 17:40.389
Way to go, not-Lisa.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.077
Bo, I think I found
Sam's hit list.

18:01.665 --> 18:04.953
And | get why some kids are
sent to work in the mines.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.662
Paul Haynes?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.707
So the murders go all the way
back to Eleanor's husband?

18:09.965 --> 18:11.705
Okay, I'm up.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.548
Hang in there,
babysitter.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.679
Looks delicious.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.548
Live crabs look
delicious to you?

18:21.810 --> 18:24.768
Well, normally
I boil them first.

18:25.814 --> 18:26.894
[Squish]

18:28.608 --> 18:29.563
Or... there's that.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.729
Boiling them live actually
toughens the flesh.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.478
So you stab them
into deliciousness.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.278
Good to know.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.368
So...

18:43.248 --> 18:45.534
How long have you
lived in Shady Grove?

18:45.792 --> 18:46.827
Six months or so.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.450
Do you like it?

18:48.962 --> 18:49.917
Sure.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.716
Your hands are so soft...

18:56.970 --> 18:58.585
Sam, where's Eleanor?

18:59.389 --> 19:00.549
She had to leave.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.887
So you had her killed.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.348
No.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.561
What about
Jake Thatcher?

19:06.730 --> 19:07.765
He was my friend.

19:08.023 --> 19:11.607
Tim Parker?
Eleanor's husband?

19:12.986 --> 19:13.941
Your wife?

19:14.195 --> 19:15.571
She lives
in San Diego now.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.778
With the man that
took her from me.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.399
Cheater.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.366
Tim Parker was
a cheater too.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.156
Bo!

19:24.414 --> 19:25.369
Just the lady
I was looking for.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.659
I'm gonna steal you
for a couple of minutes.

19:27.917 --> 19:28.747
Where are we going?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.617
It's a surprise. You'll see.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.166
Everyone's looking
forward to your crabs, Sam.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.721
Wow, well, look who
decided to show.

19:43.975 --> 19:44.930
What can I say?

19:45.185 --> 19:46.846
I live to work.

19:47.729 --> 19:48.935
And drink, apparently.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.929
Well, you said
I had to be here.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.853
You did not say
I had to be sober.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.855
You look like shit.

19:56.821 --> 20:00.154
What's this?
Trip down memory pain?

20:00.408 --> 20:02.740
Her twin showed up,
looking for her.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.404
What are the odds.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.287
Thing is, I was so bent
on vindicating Bo,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.872
that I was focused only
on the feeding signature--

20:10.126 --> 20:11.036
and not these
other wounds.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.625
Look at
these abrasions--

20:12.879 --> 20:15.916
I think she was dragged to that
alley from another kill site.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.131
Well...

20:20.303 --> 20:21.804
It's not the worst
theory I've ever heard.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.010
Thank you.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.343
Looks like you got this
covered, big boy--

20:26.601 --> 20:27.886
What, you're bailing?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.102
What's with you lately?

20:31.981 --> 20:32.936
Why?

20:35.735 --> 20:36.975
Because you care?

20:37.821 --> 20:38.856
Very much.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.070
One more crack
outta you--

20:42.325 --> 20:44.281
--and your neck's
gonna look like hers.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.369
...three, four, five... six.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.251
Last time I checked, Bo only
had five fingers on her hand.

20:55.964 --> 20:56.919
Come on, let's go.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.129
Where?

21:00.009 --> 21:01.294
Back to the crime scene.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.168
Cover those up--

21:03.430 --> 21:05.045
And maybe try
a little makeup!

21:06.599 --> 21:09.636
So I detected the microbial
volatile organic compound,

21:09.894 --> 21:12.431
Here--
And that's it.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.148
Excellent work, Lauren.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.348
I've been busy with my
upcoming inauguration,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.692
so I appreciate your
attention to detail.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.733
Maybe now is the right time
to request a brief sabbatical?

21:22.991 --> 21:25.778
I have a personal project
I'd like to pursue.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.696
No.

21:28.830 --> 21:29.910
No?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.326
You need to stay here,
where I can protect you.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.290
But you're not
protecting me.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.417
You're keeping
me prisoner.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.546
I know you broke up
with your girlfriend

21:40.800 --> 21:42.131
and you need space.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.125
But that is not my problem.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.002
Bo is not your boss. I am.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.346
And a year ago,
you were just a cop.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.262
The Dark get their hands on
you, they'll kill you, Lauren.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.139
You're pledged
to The Ash, Dr. Lewis.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.021
I fought by your side, Hale.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.277
Take the weekend if you like.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.939
And we'll see you Monday.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.784
It's true what
they say about power.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.450
It doesn't change people.

22:14.584 --> 22:15.699
It reveals them.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.414
First thing Monday morning.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.137
What's going on, ladies?

22:34.979 --> 22:36.480
Oh--
There it is.

22:36.731 --> 22:37.720
That power.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.938
You were using it on Sam.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.057
We were just talking.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.069
Don't be shy.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.151
I knew it the
second I saw you.

22:44.405 --> 22:45.485
The dark red aura.

22:45.740 --> 22:47.150
Strong--
a survivor, Bo.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.944
We want you
to join our circle.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.362
We're short a member.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.370
Eleanor.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.077
She was weak. Not like you.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.446
You have power, Bo.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.743
Haven't you ever wanted
to channel that power?

22:57.001 --> 22:58.741
To feel more?

22:59.003 --> 22:59.992
To have more?

23:00.255 --> 23:01.916
We're just gonna have
so much fun together!

23:02.173 --> 23:03.253
This shit is a blast.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.464
So, what do you
ladies do for fun?

23:06.177 --> 23:08.042
Stuff like this, for starters.

23:10.390 --> 23:14.349
Goddess of the lunar light
mistress of the seas,

23:14.602 --> 23:17.719
give me darkness,
give me night,

23:17.981 --> 23:19.937
please doth do appease.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.742
What do you say, Bo?

23:32.996 --> 23:34.861
You bitches are witches.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.747
And you can
count me in.

23:38.001 --> 23:38.990
Eek!

23:47.802 --> 23:49.918
So, normally,
we'd start out slow.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.715
But we have some
unfinished business.

23:51.973 --> 23:53.554
You'll catch on.

23:53.808 --> 23:54.388
Oh my god...

23:54.642 --> 23:56.724
Do you remember when
we did away with Paul?

23:56.978 --> 23:58.718
My handsome husband
who, as it turned out,

23:58.980 --> 24:00.345
had an apartment in the city.

24:00.607 --> 24:01.722
And a whore inside
that apartment.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.723
He was our first.
But, then we had

24:03.985 --> 24:05.725
a body to deal with.
Which I was--

24:05.987 --> 24:08.729
I found a spell and got
rid of the body-- Ta da!

24:08.990 --> 24:11.106
I don't know how I feel
about killing people.

24:11.367 --> 24:12.982
Oh, Diva, please!

24:13.244 --> 24:15.360
We are just using what
the Universe gave us

24:15.622 --> 24:18.705
to rid ourselves of the
negative forces in our lives.

24:18.958 --> 24:19.708
Like cheaters.

24:19.959 --> 24:20.823
Was Laurence a cheater?

24:21.085 --> 24:22.700
No, no, no--
If anything, it was me...

24:22.962 --> 24:25.544
And I keep telling you,
we're just on a break.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.210
You're in denial, Bo.
You need to heal.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.716
Isn't there a part of you
that wants vengeance?

24:30.970 --> 24:31.755
Oh, Susan!

24:32.013 --> 24:33.674
This is not
about vengeance.

24:33.931 --> 24:37.298
This is about strong women
understanding their worth,

24:37.560 --> 24:40.552
and taking back
the power in our lives.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.270
We are not gonna be a slave
to their shitty patriarchal--

24:43.524 --> 24:45.389
[Phone ringing]
Oh-- Hold that thought.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.358
Trick, hey--

24:48.613 --> 24:50.478
One of the tunnels
under the Dal flooded,

24:50.740 --> 24:52.696
my back-order of
Guinness finally came in,

24:52.950 --> 24:55.692
and two centaurs got
into it over a woman?

24:55.953 --> 24:58.330
Yeah, I'm kind of in the
middle of something here--

24:58.581 --> 24:59.366
Stop talking so much.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.330
Stop yelling at
me in front of her.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.666
You ramble, just smile
when she looks at you.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.875
Fine.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.118
I lost Lisa.

25:06.798 --> 25:07.253
What!

25:07.507 --> 25:08.496
We need to find her.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.464
We need to find out
who's targeting her.

25:10.718 --> 25:13.460
And we need to find out who
she's being targeted to kill.

25:13.721 --> 25:15.097
I think I got
that covered.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.133
One more thing:

25:16.391 --> 25:17.756
There's a trinket
that humans need

25:18.017 --> 25:19.553
in order to invoke the Duppy.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.096
It's called Macuto.

25:21.354 --> 25:23.561
You find that and you can
stop her from killing again.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.146
You on that, too?

25:25.400 --> 25:27.015
Like Kenzi at a waffle bar.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.151
Who was that?

25:30.405 --> 25:31.144
My psychic!

25:31.406 --> 25:32.737
I didn't tell him anything,

25:32.990 --> 25:35.117
but he knew something
big was happening.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.448
Something is.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.286
[Knocking]

25:40.540 --> 25:42.030
Isaac.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.827
I never took you
for a stalker.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.700
Well, I prefer Super Fan.

25:45.962 --> 25:48.328
I really debated whether
I was gonna come back here,

25:48.589 --> 25:50.500
but I got something
I think you need to see.

25:50.758 --> 25:51.417
What is it?

25:51.676 --> 25:54.713
I was curious why
you spent five years

25:54.971 --> 25:58.555
hiding in the Amazon jungle;
trouncing through Afghanistan.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.764
Being off the map.

26:01.018 --> 26:01.677
I'm adventurous.

26:01.936 --> 26:04.473
I asked my lawyers, who I pay
an offensive amount of money

26:04.731 --> 26:07.143
to look into it, they did
and they're very good.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.938
They dug up a bone I think
you wanted to keep buried.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.026
Karen.

26:19.954 --> 26:21.114
I don't respond to blackmail.

26:21.372 --> 26:23.533
Yeah, well, my lawyers
don't want me to associate

26:23.791 --> 26:25.167
with a known fugitive.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.753
So I fired them.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.502
What?

26:30.757 --> 26:33.169
I don't care what you
did or why you did it.

26:33.426 --> 26:34.757
Everyone has secrets.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.547
You're no stranger
to reinvention.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.341
And we both know you
could use a fresh start.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.715
So, that's the only copy.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.557
Do with it what you want.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.136
Are you serious?

26:46.397 --> 26:48.103
Well, that's what
freedom looks like.

26:48.983 --> 26:52.191
That's what you wanted, right?

26:59.786 --> 27:00.525
You sleepy?

27:00.787 --> 27:02.448
No.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.162
Dude, we've read each
one of your story books.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.912
What would Lisa do
that I'm not doing?

27:09.170 --> 27:10.876
She'd tell me a story.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.167
So...

27:16.344 --> 27:20.713
Once upon a time
there was this... superhero.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.053
Named...

27:22.975 --> 27:23.725
Super Kenz.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.136
Why was he a superhero?

27:25.394 --> 27:27.726
She, dumbass. I dunno.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.720
Because she was awesome.

27:29.982 --> 27:30.846
What were her powers?

27:31.108 --> 27:32.723
If you're gonna back
seat drive this thing

27:32.985 --> 27:34.145
I'm not even
gonna bother.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.860
I won't if you tell it better.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.698
SuperKenz wasn't
just any human.

27:44.956 --> 27:49.120
Not only did she have
killer personal style,

27:49.377 --> 27:52.540
but she had a
smorgasbord of powers.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.914
Her sense of smell was
as strong as a Wolf's.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.756
And when she sang,

27:58.010 --> 27:59.841
she could knock people
out just like a Siren.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.256
What's a Siren?

28:01.848 --> 28:04.305
A douchebag
who wears stupid hats.

28:04.559 --> 28:05.765
Forget about him.

28:06.018 --> 28:10.728
Anyway, one time, this evil
creature called a Kitsune

28:10.982 --> 28:13.564
kidnapped her
and put her in a cave.

28:13.818 --> 28:14.898
This is getting scary.

28:15.152 --> 28:18.610
But SuperKenz,
she was really smart too.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.982
She whooped that
ginger bitch's ass,

28:22.243 --> 28:25.906
escaped the cave,
and succubused a whole

28:26.163 --> 28:28.540
Frat House on the way
home, just for kicks.

28:28.791 --> 28:31.954
You just said the "b" word,
the "a" word and ginger!

28:32.587 --> 28:34.919
I wanna be like SuperKenz.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.582
You and me both, buddy.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.039
You and me both.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.761
Wow--
Binding.

28:48.019 --> 28:49.975
Feel the energy
in the wind,

28:54.609 --> 28:57.601
Feel the energy
in the trees around us.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.186
Feel it move
through your body.

29:00.948 --> 29:04.190
Feel us becoming
stronger, as one.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.157
We call to you.
We invite you here.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.701
Go to avenge us.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.119
Shed no tear.

29:13.377 --> 29:16.710
All that you are,
and all that I am.

29:16.964 --> 29:22.550
Draw us the blood,
of one man-- Sam.

29:22.803 --> 29:23.963
Sam?

29:25.139 --> 29:26.299
And Kenzi.

29:26.557 --> 29:27.933
We agreed to take down that
price-gouging misogynist

29:28.184 --> 29:28.934
at the mechanic shop.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.891
Who gives a rat's
ass about Sam?

29:31.145 --> 29:33.136
I don't think I'm
ready for this after all--

29:33.397 --> 29:35.137
I don't think you
get how this works.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.606
The circle can't be broken
unless we all agree

29:37.860 --> 29:40.351
to unbind it and now that
you've contributed your power?

29:40.613 --> 29:43.195
Lisa's gonna
be unstoppable.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.122
Kenzi?
I'm home.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.081
Kenzi?

30:04.595 --> 30:05.926
Lisa...?
It's you?

30:06.180 --> 30:08.671
This whole time,
I thought it was Caroline--

30:08.933 --> 30:09.718
The book club--!

30:09.976 --> 30:11.557
Oh, no!
Dead girl walkin'!

30:11.978 --> 30:14.720
Lisa, honey, put the
pointy, kill-y thing down.

30:14.981 --> 30:15.720
Where's Ethan?!

30:15.982 --> 30:16.687
He's upstairs. He's fine.

30:16.941 --> 30:19.478
Lisa, it's me, Kenzi.

30:19.735 --> 30:22.067
You have to stop!
You can stop!

30:25.157 --> 30:28.115
Caroline, look at me.
You don't want to do this.

30:28.369 --> 30:31.736
[Laughing]
Oh my god!

30:31.998 --> 30:33.613
That is better than sex.

30:33.874 --> 30:34.738
Then you're doing it wrong.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.743
I've been destined
for this my entire life.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.540
You're just a human
who got lucky

30:39.797 --> 30:41.162
and found a fancy
hoodoo necklace.

30:41.424 --> 30:43.540
The point is, there's
nothing we can't do!

30:43.801 --> 30:46.668
Make ourselves younger,
take over the PTA--

30:46.929 --> 30:47.918
Get free blowouts.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.135
Honestly, Susan!

30:49.390 --> 30:51.551
Every time I think you
can't get any stupider--

30:51.809 --> 30:54.551
Oh-- Classy.
What a good friend.

30:54.812 --> 30:55.437
Oh, whatever.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.428
The power lies in the circle.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.931
In our collective energy.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.645
So why do you get
to be the leader?

31:03.362 --> 31:05.523
Who the hell does she
think she is anyway?

31:05.781 --> 31:07.112
I was wondering
the same thing.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.697
That's amazing.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.244
And you--
are a bitch!

31:14.498 --> 31:15.578
You're an idiot, Susan.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.869
And as usual, you have no
idea what you're doing.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.459
Unlike you, who's using
an innocent teenage girl

31:20.713 --> 31:22.704
to live out her sick
revenge fantasies.

31:22.965 --> 31:23.329
Shut up.

31:23.591 --> 31:24.797
You shut up!

31:28.596 --> 31:29.506
What's happening?

31:29.764 --> 31:31.129
I'll just take that--

31:32.183 --> 31:34.014
I can't control it, Kenzi.

31:34.268 --> 31:35.428
I can't.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.727
I hate stupid book club.
And gluten-free bread.

31:38.981 --> 31:39.891
And killing
innocent people!

31:40.149 --> 31:42.390
Tim wasn't innocent!
He cheated on me!

31:42.651 --> 31:43.686
Over and over and over!

31:43.944 --> 31:45.195
I'm talking about Sam!

31:45.446 --> 31:46.902
The hot new
dad on the block.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.522
Who rejected you when
you tried to sleep with him.

31:49.784 --> 31:50.739
Nobody rejects me.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.324
Ha!
Everyone does!

31:52.578 --> 31:54.364

our mechanic,

year old son!

31:56.165 --> 31:59.532
Suck on that vegan
energy bar, you bitch!

32:02.797 --> 32:05.288
Susan,
you are so strong.

32:06.801 --> 32:09.838
You know not your
true strength, child.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.506
But soon you will.

32:11.764 --> 32:14.722
And the world will
bow down before us!

32:17.770 --> 32:19.306
I'll be damned--

[Carousel music playing]

32:35.955 --> 32:37.866
Who are you?

32:56.183 --> 32:57.764
Okay!
What the hell?

32:58.018 --> 33:00.350
Where are we?
Crime scene's back there.

33:01.772 --> 33:02.887
I smelled something.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.731
If you're chasing tail,
I so don't want to be

33:05.985 --> 33:07.316
on the ride-along.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.109
That dead Fae,
Riley--

33:09.363 --> 33:10.899
--she was
dragged from here.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.317
I'm sure of it.

33:13.784 --> 33:16.116
I'm glad you're here
with me on this one, partner.

33:18.956 --> 33:20.321
Dyson, |--

33:20.583 --> 33:22.164
I have to tell
you something.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.919
Some serious shit
is about to go down--

33:27.173 --> 33:28.538
Tams, call it in--

33:29.049 --> 33:30.334
What?

33:30.593 --> 33:31.753
This whole field--

33:33.804 --> 33:35.886
it smells like death.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.641
Bo, it's time.

33:41.896 --> 33:43.306
Are you ready?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.187
Is this really
the only way?

33:47.151 --> 33:49.312
She's running on what's
left of the witches' Chi,

33:49.570 --> 33:50.901
and she's fading fast.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.899
It's a mercy. Trust me.

34:06.295 --> 34:07.330
Will it hurt?

34:07.588 --> 34:08.703
No.

34:09.590 --> 34:12.127
Lisa, are you sure
this is what you wanna do?

34:14.261 --> 34:15.922
I'm eighteen,

34:16.180 --> 34:18.341
and I've never
kissed a boy.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.132
I've never been to Europe.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.182
I'll never be a doctor.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.316
I'm also already dead.

34:35.366 --> 34:36.321
Please--

34:36.575 --> 34:38.566
I just need a second.

34:38.827 --> 34:42.115
It's hard for me to know
I'll never have what you have.

34:42.373 --> 34:45.490
I mean, look at you.
Your life's a mess.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.325
[Laughing]

34:47.586 --> 34:48.746
Thanks.

34:49.171 --> 34:52.334
I mean-- you have
a life to mess up.

34:52.591 --> 34:56.550
You have family
and friends...

34:56.804 --> 34:58.635
And memories.

34:59.181 --> 35:00.717
Even if they're bad ones.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.931
I never really thought
about it that way.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.599
I'll be invoked
in a hundred years.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.771
And a hundred
years after that.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.526
Whomever
has this necklace

35:11.777 --> 35:13.517
will be able to
summon the dark.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.645
Make me-- kill.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.947
What if I'm there
for you, Lisa?

35:23.956 --> 35:26.288
I'll be around
in a hundred years.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.908
And a hundred
years after that.

35:30.379 --> 35:33.667
That is the first time I've
ever said that out loud.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.916
You're gonna stop me
from hurting people?

35:37.970 --> 35:38.834
Every time?

35:39.096 --> 35:41.257
I give you my word.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.091
But no.

35:45.394 --> 35:49.512
Kenzi said that
being Fae was special.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.689
But I don't want
to be special.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.319
I want to be human.

35:57.156 --> 36:01.445
If I can't have that,
I want to be at peace.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.864
Will you give me that?

36:06.999 --> 36:08.705
I promise.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.634
That feels nice.

36:26.602 --> 36:29.469
You have such a pretty face.

36:47.581 --> 36:49.117
Goodnight, sweet girl.

They will never use you again.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.973
Now.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.098
I'm so sorry you had
to go through that.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.187
What am I doing?

37:57.568 --> 37:58.728
What do you mean?

37:59.945 --> 38:03.312
I mean, what am
I doing here, Kenzi?

38:03.574 --> 38:05.735
Here, where?
What are you talking about?

38:08.954 --> 38:12.446
When I was in the
Temple during the Dawning,

38:13.584 --> 38:15.290
I saw something.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.369
I felt something.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.753
More... dead people?

38:21.383 --> 38:22.748
Love.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.083
It was a vision.
Or maybe a memory.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.505
I don't know, but--

38:26.763 --> 38:28.264
I didn't see his face--

38:30.350 --> 38:32.011
It was my father.

38:33.770 --> 38:34.805
Are you serious?

I can't stop
thinking about it.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.232
It's like I have this power
I didn't have before.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.320
And I think my dad has
something to do with it.

38:44.573 --> 38:45.733
Wow!

38:46.366 --> 38:48.527
Your dad--
That's huge.

38:50.787 --> 38:53.529
I think we need to deal
with one thing at a time.

38:53.790 --> 38:57.453
Enough with this dance
a break up, or not a break up.

38:57.711 --> 38:58.746
That is the question.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.120
I am so much
better with weapons.

I have canceled my newspaper
and put my cable on hold

39:56.270 --> 39:59.228

the cat bowl to last a month.

your cat with you.

I was joking.

I joke when I'm nervous.

40:06.071 --> 40:06.856
I see.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.695
This is a very
big step for me.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.735
And a giant leap for science.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.659
There's nothing
to worry about, trust me.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.868
Okay, I'm gonna bring
this down to the limo--

she doing here?

42:31.800 --> 42:33.336
