WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.708 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I gotta be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.208
Winnie the Pooh

01:10.708 --> 01:13.708
Oh, I do hope
friend Rabbit is home.

01:19.125 --> 01:21.083
Hello, Rabbit.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.875
Rabbit, is everything
all right in there?

01:25.875 --> 01:27.375
Oh, it's Pooh.
No, no, no, no.

01:27.375 --> 01:28.708
Not again today.

01:28.708 --> 01:31.708
Ooh! This time
he shall not pass.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.875
Oh, thank you,
Pooh Bear.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.166
Pooh Bear!

01:37.166 --> 01:40.458
Uh, uh,
how did you get in here?

01:40.458 --> 01:42.291
The back door was open.

01:42.291 --> 01:44.458
The back door.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.583
I was just passing by,
and I thought,

01:47.583 --> 01:49.833
if it were not
too much trouble,

01:49.833 --> 01:54.083
- might I--
- Borrow a small
smackerel of honey?

01:54.083 --> 01:56.125
Why, yes.

01:56.125 --> 01:59.166
You see,
I seem to be all out.

01:59.166 --> 02:03.416
But you've borrowed my honey
for eight straight days,
Pooh Bear,

02:03.416 --> 02:05.000
and, uh--

02:05.000 --> 02:08.458
Besides, I'm just
all out of honey
at this moment.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.875
Why, Rabbit,
there's some honey.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.708
- Where?
- Here.

02:14.708 --> 02:18.000
It must have been hiding
back here behind your back.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.375
Lucky I dropped in to
find it for you, Rabbit.

02:21.375 --> 02:26.458
Now, if you please,
just a small smackerel?

02:26.458 --> 02:28.583
Ahh. Oh, all right.

02:38.458 --> 02:42.500
I did mean
just a little larger
small smackerel.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.291
I was afraid of that.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.583
Why, thank you, Rabbit.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.208
Yeah, don't mention it.

02:57.125 --> 02:59.958
Oh, this is too much.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.000
- Eeyore: Hello.
-

03:12.166 --> 03:14.166
Oh. Eeyore.
Whew.

03:14.166 --> 03:15.708
It's only you.

03:15.708 --> 03:18.208
Sorry to disappoint ya.

03:18.208 --> 03:21.208
Guess I'm too dull
to be around.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.708
Can't blame ya
for movin' away.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.000
No, no, no, no, no,
Eeyore.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.458
It's not you.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.875
I'm not really
moving at all.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.708
Just pretending to.

03:31.708 --> 03:35.291
That way, when Pooh comes
looking for honey again,

03:35.291 --> 03:38.458
he'll think I'm gone.

03:38.458 --> 03:41.458
Why'd you want to do that?

03:41.458 --> 03:46.375
Because that bear has
eaten me out of house
and honey.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.375
-  It's him.
It's him!

03:51.375 --> 03:53.875
I gotta hide.
Gotta hide.

03:53.875 --> 03:56.000
Hello, Eeyore.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.250
Hello, Pooh.

04:02.583 --> 04:05.250
Oh, bother.
Empty again.

04:06.708 --> 04:10.291
Time for a visit to
my good friend Rabbit.

04:12.875 --> 04:17.333
My good friend Rabbit
is moving away?

04:17.333 --> 04:21.333
Yep. Said he's been
eaten out of house and honey.

04:21.333 --> 04:24.250
House and honey?

04:24.250 --> 04:25.875
Oh, my.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.333
Well, this is terrible.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.416
My good friend Rabbit's
run out of honey and--

04:29.416 --> 04:34.583
He's worried I won't
come visit him anymore.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.708
- He is?
- Yes.

04:36.708 --> 04:39.625
Oh, my.
I must get poor Rabbit
some more honey,

04:39.625 --> 04:42.958
and-- and then
he won't have to move away.

04:49.416 --> 04:51.958
Oh, this is "ridickerous."

04:51.958 --> 04:55.458
Pooh: But Tigger,
we don't want Rabbit
to move away.

04:55.458 --> 04:59.416
Besides,
you shall be a perfect bee.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.750
You've got
the stripes for it. See?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Say, buddy bear,
you're right!

05:06.000 --> 05:09.750
But, uh, wha--
what do I have to do, Pooh?

05:09.750 --> 05:11.750
Oh, just act like
a flower, Piglet.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.375
Tigger will
buzz around you,

05:13.375 --> 05:16.458
convincing the real bees of
how good you smell.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.000
And when they come down
to get a whiff,

05:19.000 --> 05:21.458
I shall get their honey.

05:21.458 --> 05:26.000
Okay, buddy boy,
here we go.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.166
A buzz, a buzz,

05:27.166 --> 05:28.500
a buzz, buzz, buzz.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.125
A biz, a booz,
a wiz, waz, wooz.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.875
A weez, a weez,
I'm talkin' bees,

05:33.875 --> 05:35.750
way up there in
the honey trees--

05:35.750 --> 05:38.333
- Psst. Tigger.
- Huh?

05:38.333 --> 05:41.625
Tigger,
could you possibly buzz
with a little more "uzz"?

05:41.625 --> 05:43.875
And a little less jazz?

05:43.875 --> 05:48.291
He wants more "uzz."

05:48.291 --> 05:51.375
Why, sure,
buddy boy.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.000
Buzz, buzz.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.875
- A buzz, buzz, buzz.
-

05:54.875 --> 05:58.333
Bees, bees,
a bees, bees, bees.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.875
- Weez, weez,
up in the tree.
- Oh, boy.

06:04.583 --> 06:07.208
Piglet: I don't want to
appear c-c-c-concerned,

06:07.208 --> 06:10.458
- Tigger, but--
- Oh, you're doing great,
Piglet.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.625
Just keep
your petals up.

06:12.625 --> 06:17.000
-  But the bees
are tickling my--

06:19.375 --> 06:23.958
Ah, ah, ah, ahh-choo!

06:26.708 --> 06:28.500
- Yike!

06:35.875 --> 06:37.708
Pooh: Oh. Yow!

06:38.708 --> 06:42.500
Pooh: Whoo. Yow!

06:43.583 --> 06:46.416
We gotcha, buddy bear.

06:46.416 --> 06:50.250
Th-th-think
light thoughts, Pooh.

06:50.250 --> 06:54.583
Oof! Whoa!

06:56.250 --> 06:58.000
Could it be we're...

06:58.000 --> 07:00.750
going about this
the wrong way?

07:09.416 --> 07:12.875
Oops. Missed by 17 and
seven-eighths inches.

07:20.416 --> 07:23.958
See? Smack dab
on the dingy.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.333
Thank you, Gopher.

07:26.958 --> 07:29.125
Ooh!

07:29.125 --> 07:33.083
Say, quit your shovin'.

07:33.083 --> 07:35.458
Why'd you want to
tunnel into a tree, anyway?

07:35.458 --> 07:37.958
To get Rabbit's honey,
of course.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.458
I must repay him
for his kindness,

07:42.458 --> 07:44.375
and stop him from moving.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.875
Uh, Gopher,

07:47.875 --> 07:51.208
I seem to have
some small problems.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.000
Gang way!

07:55.000 --> 07:56.416
All: Oof!

07:57.458 --> 07:59.500
All: Whoaah!

07:59.500 --> 08:01.458
Come on, follow me.

08:01.458 --> 08:04.458
We'll lose those pests
in my tunnels.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.125
Goin' down.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.000
It's a dead end.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
We're trapped.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Trapped like ratchets.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.291
Uh, uh, Gopher,
you can dig us out of here.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.833
Can't you?

08:43.833 --> 08:47.000
Just a few more inches
and we'll hit fresh air.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.208
Or the bottom of the lake.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.500
Run!

08:58.166 --> 09:00.250
Oh, look. Honey.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.333
Look, Piglet.
A whole pot of honey

09:04.333 --> 09:07.083
for our very
dear friend Rabbit.

09:08.708 --> 09:09.958
Oh, bother.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.708
Whoa.

09:14.708 --> 09:19.125
Ahh. Well, I guess my
little trick worked.

09:19.125 --> 09:23.500
Pooh Bear
hasn't borrowed honey
for one whole day.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.583
Huh?

09:29.583 --> 09:31.458
Hello, Rabbit.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.000
Oh, no!
Not again!

09:34.000 --> 09:36.583
No more honey!

09:36.583 --> 09:39.500
I know. That's why
I brought you--

09:39.500 --> 09:42.458
No! This is the last straw.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.416
If honey means more to you
than our friendship,

09:45.416 --> 09:46.458
then--

09:50.833 --> 09:52.875
Oh, dear.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.500
I-- I'm sorry,
Rabbit.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.291
Uh, I'll get you
some more honey
right now.

09:58.291 --> 10:02.000
Just please don't
move away. Please?

10:05.583 --> 10:06.625
Honey?

10:06.625 --> 10:09.250
Pooh brought honey?

10:09.250 --> 10:10.583
For me?

10:12.708 --> 10:15.291
Pooh: Please. Honey.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.333
No more honey.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.833
No. Oh, please
don't move away.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.250
Stay with us, Rabbit.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.458
I'll bring you
some honey.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.833
Bring you
some more honey.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.583
I promise.
Mm-hmm.

10:33.958 --> 10:37.000
Oh. Silly old bear.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.583
Hello, Rabbit.

10:45.583 --> 10:48.583
Oh, well, come in,
Pooh Bear.

10:48.583 --> 10:52.333
My goodness,
how very nice to see you.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.375
Me, too, Rabbit.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.458
I've, uh, brought you
some honey.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.625
So now you don't
have to move away.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.583
Why, so you have.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.125
How thoughtful.

11:05.125 --> 11:07.458
I was, uh, all out.

11:07.458 --> 11:11.625
Mm-hmm.
Well, it looks as though
it might be time for a--

11:11.625 --> 11:13.375
Why, yes.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.958
Thank you, Rabbit.

11:14.958 --> 11:18.125
Perhaps I will have
just a little taste.

11:22.625 --> 11:26.833
My, Rabbit.
You certainly are a friend.

11:26.833 --> 11:29.000
Indeed, Pooh.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.083
Indeed.

11:54.291 --> 11:55.875
Oh, poor Eeyore.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.375
Still staring at the clouds.

12:05.375 --> 12:09.875
Uh, um, I have
called you all here today

12:09.875 --> 12:12.208
be-- uh,
because of Eeyore.

12:12.208 --> 12:15.125
He's always so sad.
He's, uh--

12:15.125 --> 12:18.875
Why, he's sitting
out in the rain even now.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.083
We-we-we gotta
do something.

12:21.083 --> 12:24.750
Well, of course,
we'll do something,
Piglet.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.708
Uh, what did you have
in mind?

12:27.708 --> 12:33.250
Well, uh, if-- if I were
a very s-s-sad animal,

12:33.250 --> 12:34.750
I'd want someone
to cheer me up.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.458
"Definootely."

12:36.458 --> 12:38.583
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, of course.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.125
I knew it all the time.
Mm-hm.

12:40.125 --> 12:42.375
Hey, I got it!

12:42.375 --> 12:45.583
Tomorrow we'll all take turns
cheerin' up old Eeyore.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.625
Yeah. He'll be
Donkey for a Day.

12:48.625 --> 12:51.750
Roo and me will teach him
how to bounce.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.583
Bounce? Hah!

12:53.583 --> 12:57.583
Gardening is the only
true happiness.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.000
Ohh, no, no, no.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.416
Flying. Soaring
the light fantastic.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.333
Sailing high over hill--

13:04.333 --> 13:06.750
What a great idea, Piglet.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.458
Uh, what'll you do?

13:09.458 --> 13:13.416
Me? Well, I'll, uh--
I'll, uh--

13:13.416 --> 13:15.416
Ohh. What can I do?

13:15.416 --> 13:18.625
Oh, you can just watch
the rest of us in action.

13:18.625 --> 13:20.875
And then just do
what Piglets do best.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.125
Whatever that is.

13:24.125 --> 13:28.083
Oh, what to do.
What to do.

13:28.083 --> 13:31.125
I know.

13:31.125 --> 13:34.500
I'll ask Pooh Bear
how to make Eeyore happy.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.875
Eeyore: Thanks for
inviting me over, Pooh Bear.

13:36.875 --> 13:41.000
Guess you couldn't get anyone
more interestin' to come.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.333
Servin' leftovers?

13:43.333 --> 13:46.750
No, Eeyore.
I'm going to
cheer you up.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.833
Well,
I'm already cheered up.

13:50.708 --> 13:52.000
See?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Now, the way to stay
the happiest

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
is to let
your tongue lickle,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
and keep
your tummy tickled.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.833
Not that I'm complainin',

14:01.833 --> 14:03.250
but I don't like--

14:05.833 --> 14:08.875
I know what you mean.

14:08.875 --> 14:11.875
I can see
you're happy already.

14:14.833 --> 14:18.833
Ahh. Pooh,
if you don't mind--

14:18.833 --> 14:20.708
Of course,
I don't mind.

14:20.708 --> 14:23.208
Second helpings are what
happiness is all about.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.333
Oh, dear.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.250
Look what a wonderful time
they're having.

14:29.250 --> 14:34.333
How will I ever
be able to make Eeyore
as happy as th-that?

14:37.875 --> 14:39.875
Ahh.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.833
Oh, bother.

14:41.833 --> 14:42.875
It's empty.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.625
Why, so's yours.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.958
That's all right, Pooh.

14:53.958 --> 14:57.291
Donkeys aren't
especially keen on honey.

14:57.291 --> 14:59.500
Especially this donkey.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.583
Well, then,
let's find something
you do like.

15:05.708 --> 15:09.458
First,
we'll get some apples.

15:09.458 --> 15:13.583
Well, if you're sure you
want to waste them on me.

15:13.583 --> 15:14.958
Hee-ow.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.875
Look out, Eeyore.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.750
I think I dropped one.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.750
Thanks for warnin' me.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.583
Ow!

15:26.583 --> 15:28.166
Watch out again.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.000
Um, Eeyore.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.458
Yes, Pooh?

15:39.416 --> 15:41.166
Hmm.

15:41.166 --> 15:44.083
Now that was what I call
a happy time.

15:45.875 --> 15:49.416
Although
it's what most people
simply call a breakfast.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.458
I'd like to call a doctor.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.000
Not that I'm complainin',
mind ya.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.708
But just think,

15:56.708 --> 15:59.166
we've still got lunch
and dinner to go.

16:04.458 --> 16:09.958
I said we still have
lunch and dinner to go.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.583
Eeyore?

16:11.583 --> 16:14.000
Eeyore?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.458
Poor Eeyore.

16:16.458 --> 16:21.458
Something must not have
agreed with him at breakfast.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.833
I shall just have to
start eating from
the beginning,

16:23.833 --> 16:25.458
and see where I went wrong.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.333
Look at him.
He's having so much fun.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.625
Why do I have
the feelin'

16:31.625 --> 16:34.958
this is not gonna be
much fun?

16:34.958 --> 16:37.875
Ohh, but it will be fun,
Eeyore.

16:37.875 --> 16:41.000
More fun than sitting on
your old mountain top.

16:42.708 --> 16:45.208
Now, why'd you do that?

16:45.208 --> 16:47.083
Because it's time for
your solo.

16:48.458 --> 16:52.583
How I remember
my first flight,

16:52.583 --> 16:54.583
- soaring on high.
-

16:54.583 --> 16:56.208
The wind in my feathers,

16:56.208 --> 16:59.000
the whole world
opening up before me.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.375
Oh, it was like yesterday.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.708
Happiness is seeing

17:06.708 --> 17:10.208
the benefits of
good hard work.

17:10.208 --> 17:13.333
Ahh. Watching the things
you planted

17:13.333 --> 17:14.875
with your own hands

17:14.875 --> 17:18.208
springing up fresh
and green.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.166
And then--

17:22.083 --> 17:24.833
Harvesting them!

17:27.750 --> 17:29.000
Oops.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Here we go again.

17:32.625 --> 17:34.875
If you wouldn't mind.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.083
Oh, why, certainly.
I don't understand.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.333
My big feet--
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.291
Not that an Eeyore's tail
is very important,

17:42.291 --> 17:46.291
but could you maybe stick it
back in the right place?

17:48.125 --> 17:50.000
Yo-oh-oh-oh!

17:51.416 --> 17:54.083
-

17:54.875 --> 17:57.000
Swimming? No.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.708
Dancing? No.

17:59.708 --> 18:04.083
Ohh. Perhaps running
would make Eeyore happy.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.708
Even I could teach him that.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.625
Rabbit: Slow down!
Slow down!

18:08.625 --> 18:10.875
Whoo! Stop running so fast!

18:13.875 --> 18:16.458
Mm. This is very frustrating

18:16.458 --> 18:19.458
to a very small
and uninspired animal.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.833
I guess this must be...

18:22.833 --> 18:25.625
make Eeyore miserable day.

18:25.625 --> 18:30.708
So what kind of agony
do you have in store for me?

18:30.708 --> 18:33.000
Ahh, don't worry,
Eeyore.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.166
Bouncing
will make you happy.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.458
Yeah, and you'll be
twice as happy.

18:37.458 --> 18:42.166
Uh, because you got
twice as many legs
to bounce with.

18:42.166 --> 18:45.458
Look at us go!

18:45.458 --> 18:48.291
Ice skating.
Yo-yoing.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.958
Hiding under the bed.

18:49.958 --> 18:52.500
Oh, what am I gonna do?

18:52.500 --> 18:55.416
It's my turn n-n-next.

18:55.416 --> 18:56.458
Uh, Tigger.

18:58.708 --> 19:02.333
Boy, how did everything
get so small down there?

19:03.083 --> 19:04.833
Abandon donkey!

19:08.125 --> 19:09.958
Roo: Grab his springs.

19:12.291 --> 19:13.875
Don't worry, kiddo.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.750
When you come down,
we'll be ready for ya.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.125
I can't hardly wait.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.000
Tally-ho.

19:31.458 --> 19:33.333
There.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.875
Right on
the old bull's eye.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.750
Eee-yow!

19:37.750 --> 19:39.208
Maybe not.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.166
You know,

19:45.166 --> 19:48.000
he sure swims a lot better
than he bounces.

19:54.708 --> 19:57.000
Oh, you, too,
little Piglet?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.166
Go ahead.
I'm ready.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.208
Cheer me up.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.500
Oh, Eeyore,
I-I-I'd love to.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.875
I mean,
I'm supposed to.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.833
But, I-I guess I'm
really here to--

20:12.833 --> 20:15.708
To apologize.

20:15.708 --> 20:18.250
You are always
sitting up here so--

20:18.250 --> 20:20.083
so sad.

20:20.083 --> 20:24.458
Then everyone did
such a good job of
cheering you up,

20:24.458 --> 20:30.000
and I-I-I have no way
to make you h-h-happy.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.208
So that's what this is
all about.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.750
Well, I'm grateful
to you all.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.083
Even if you
almost killed me.

20:44.083 --> 20:47.708
But I don't come up here
because I'm sad.

20:47.708 --> 20:50.208
I come up here
'cause I'm happy.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.583
- No?
- Nope.

20:52.583 --> 20:55.291
Let me show you
somethin'.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.875
Because you are
a good friend.

20:57.875 --> 21:01.333
Now watch that cloud.

21:02.875 --> 21:03.958
Ooh.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.125
My goodness.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.125
What's going on?

21:24.125 --> 21:25.458
Cloud painting.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.083
Eeyore invented it.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.250
It's "spec-tacaler."

21:34.000 --> 21:36.458
Eeyore:
Ahh, anybody can do it.

21:36.458 --> 21:39.166
Just use your imagination.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.291
Wow.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.458
Thank you.

21:49.458 --> 21:51.750
Thank you for
sharing this, Eeyore.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.750
It's made everyone
so happy.

21:54.750 --> 21:58.208
Just returning the favor,
Piglet.

21:58.208 --> 22:00.750
Just returning the favor.
