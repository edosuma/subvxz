WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.504
What are you doing?
Panicking.

00:03.536 --> 00:05.139
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire slayer...

00:05.173 --> 00:07.875
See you all at graduation.

00:07.908 --> 00:11.345
I want my life to be with you.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.012
I don't.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.382
I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.984
(grunts)

00:18.018 --> 00:22.190
BUFFY: Angel!
ANGEL:
 It's poison. I can feel it.

00:22.222 --> 00:23.490
The only way to cure this thing

00:23.524 --> 00:25.658
is to drain the
blood of a slayer.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.361
BUFFY:
 Angel needs to drain a slayer,
 then I'll bring him one.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.767
FAITH:
 You killed me.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.792
*

01:23.984 --> 01:25.986
(glass crunching)

01:33.826 --> 01:35.962
There's nobody
here, sir.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.799
No.

01:38.831 --> 01:41.968
No, she'd take
the fight outside.

01:43.936 --> 01:45.673
My Faith doesn't like
to be cooped up.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.776
We have to find them.

01:48.808 --> 01:51.078
Put everyone on it.
Do it now.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.111
But, sir,
the ascension...

01:52.146 --> 01:54.182
Find them!

01:58.186 --> 02:00.953
Faith's a good girl.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.822
She can take anything
they'll throw at her.

02:02.855 --> 02:05.125
(door closes in distance)
She's gonna be all right.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.498
She'll be all right.
She'll be all right.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.104
(wolf howling)

02:18.138 --> 02:20.073
*

03:09.723 --> 03:11.224
Any word from Buffy?

03:11.259 --> 03:12.560
Not yet.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.993
Here's your coffee.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.862
Brewed from the finest
Colombian lighter fluid.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.265
Oh, thank you.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.068
Horrible.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.737
Aren't you supposed to be
drinking tea, anyway?

03:24.771 --> 03:26.439
Tea is soothing.
I wish to be tense.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.074
Okay, but you're destroying

03:28.108 --> 03:30.544
a perfectly good
cultural stereotype here.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.513
Look through the, um...

03:32.545 --> 03:34.682
Kippler Volumes.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.183
Uh, any reference
to the demon Olvikan.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.287
Um, powers,
weaknesses,

03:39.319 --> 03:41.354
hat size.
There's got to be something.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.522
Still batting zero?

03:42.555 --> 03:45.393
But I mean, uh, in cricket?

03:46.993 --> 03:48.596
Cordy, what's up?

03:48.628 --> 03:50.129
I demand an explanation.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.399
For what?

03:51.432 --> 03:52.900
Wesley.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.401
Uh...

03:54.435 --> 03:56.036
inbreeding?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.138
So very funny.
Any minute, I'm sure to laugh.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.606
I just got off the phone

03:59.639 --> 04:01.108
with him. He could
hardly speak,

04:01.140 --> 04:02.575
he was so upset.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.044
He said that there was
something about a fight,

04:04.076 --> 04:06.747
and he's leaving the country.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.882
Shall I assay
remorse?

04:08.915 --> 04:11.685
Just tell me what's going on.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.923
Buffy's quit the Council.

04:15.955 --> 04:19.392
She'll not be working
with Wesley from now on.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.829
But he's her watcher.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.797
Buffy no longer needs a watcher.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.932
Well, does he have
to leave the country?

04:25.966 --> 04:28.802
I mean, you got fired
and you still hang around

04:28.836 --> 04:30.838
like a big loser, why can't he?

04:32.204 --> 04:34.074
Cordelia. We're trying to stop

04:34.106 --> 04:35.675
a massacre here.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.511
Want to give us a hand?

04:39.812 --> 04:42.816
Sure.

04:44.183 --> 04:47.987
That's just such
a Buffy thing to do.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.524
She's always
thinking of herself.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.271
You're awake.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.307
You... you've been
watching over me?

05:16.550 --> 05:19.720
Well, we've been taking turns.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.189
I thought...

05:22.221 --> 05:24.591
I thought I'd never
see you again.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.129
I can't leave you.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.165
I-I... I was wrong.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.235
I need you.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.670
Oh.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.574
You mean you need Buffy.

05:44.276 --> 05:45.345
Willow?

05:45.379 --> 05:48.215
Yes, right. Willow.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.516
Where is she?

05:49.550 --> 05:52.386
She'll be back soon.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.435
Any change?

06:07.468 --> 06:10.670
He's delirious.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.238
He thought I was Buffy.

06:12.271 --> 06:13.740
You, too, huh?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.209
I hope she gets here soon.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.545
She'd better, if...

06:18.579 --> 06:20.548
Yeah.

06:21.814 --> 06:24.050
I feel so...

06:24.084 --> 06:26.185
I feel so guilty.

06:26.218 --> 06:28.788
Guilty?

06:28.822 --> 06:31.759
Well, things are so terrible

06:31.792 --> 06:33.927
and everything's coming apart,

06:33.961 --> 06:36.596
and I'm just...

06:36.629 --> 06:38.230
In some ways,

06:38.264 --> 06:40.266
it's the best night of my life.

06:42.935 --> 06:44.572
The best?

06:45.605 --> 06:47.173
The best.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.591
I just checked on him
just now. We're watching.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.161
Did you find Faith?

07:10.798 --> 07:13.600
You didn't...
She's not here?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.971
How is he?

07:18.004 --> 07:20.106
He comes in and out.

07:21.774 --> 07:25.177
I think the pain is less.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.713
Now.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.250
Would you guys...

07:31.283 --> 07:34.086
I'd like to be alone with him.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.122
Course.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.194
We'll try to find
another cure.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.197
Thanks.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.112
(moans)

08:00.146 --> 08:03.651
Buffy.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.817
It's you?

08:04.851 --> 08:07.920
It's me.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.360
I didn't want to go
without seeing you.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.630
Angel, I can cure you.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.432
It's okay.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.702
I'm ready.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.637
Angel, listen to me.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.906
Sit up.
(grunts)

08:30.877 --> 08:32.879
You're gonna live.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.914
You have to live.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.317
What do I...

08:37.350 --> 08:39.086
Drink.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.030
Drink me.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.668
No.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.903
It's the only way.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.171
Get away.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.006
It'll save you.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.508
It'll kill you.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.210
Maybe not.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.878
Not if you don't
take it all.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.346
You can't ask me
to do this.

09:07.379 --> 09:10.918
I won't let you die.
I can't.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.120
Angel, the blood of a slayer
is the only cure.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.088
Faith.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.357
I tried.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.559
I killed her.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.663
Then it's over.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.940
It is never over.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.908
I won't let you die.
Drink.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.476
Please.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.692
(growls)

10:00.768 --> 10:02.702
(growls)

10:31.999 --> 10:33.399
*

10:55.688 --> 10:58.158
(panting)

11:00.760 --> 11:02.763
Buffy?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.735
Buffy.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.580
I need some help. She...
she's lost a lot of blood.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.315
What happened?
She needs blood.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.017
Try to stay calm. We're
gonna take care of her.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.485
Something bit her.
She needs a transfusion now.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.720
You found her?
Yes.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.888
Was she conscious?
Yes.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.155
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.524
Okay. I need a type
and a cross-match.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.393
Get her on two lines
of Ringer's Lactate

11:33.426 --> 11:34.995
and watch for hypovolemic shock.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.495
Tell me, what happened?

11:36.528 --> 11:37.998
Something bit her.
I don't know what.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.332
Okay, I need a rabies shot
treatment. Any allergies?

11:40.366 --> 11:43.370
No. Just help her.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.606
You two been doing drugs?

11:49.475 --> 11:51.211
You want her to live,

11:51.244 --> 11:52.879
you're gonna have
to be straight with me.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.447
She's clean.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.183
All right.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.852
Wait outside.
Let us work.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.089
A phone.

12:02.121 --> 12:05.392
Right out there.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.405
DOCTOR:
Bones are set.

12:19.438 --> 12:23.110
And damage to the kidneys
is repairable,

12:23.143 --> 12:26.745
but the head trauma, it's...

12:26.779 --> 12:30.250
Well, it's simply too severe.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.219
You know, it's a wonder
she's alive at all

12:32.251 --> 12:34.254
with the blood loss.

12:36.588 --> 12:38.591
I-I'm sorry, sir.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.427
There's almost
no chance

12:40.460 --> 12:44.030
that she's ever gonna
regain consciousness.

13:00.212 --> 13:03.350
It's your day.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.187
NURSE:
We have another young girl,
severe blood loss.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.687
Dr. Powell
wants you to prep

13:08.721 --> 13:10.523
to assist
on an antecubital cutdown.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.558
I'll be right there.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.577
*

13:52.899 --> 13:54.834
NURSE:
Oh, my God!

13:54.868 --> 13:58.238
Sir, no!

13:58.270 --> 14:00.273
Somebody call
security!

14:03.409 --> 14:05.245
Don't do that.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.679
I will. I'll do
that and worse.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.816
Murderous little fiend.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.817
Did you see what
she did to my Faith?

14:11.850 --> 14:13.586
Hadn't made plans
to weep over that one.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.989
Well, I'd get set for some
weeping if I were you.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.158
I'd get set for a world of pain.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.893
Misery loves company, young man,

14:19.927 --> 14:21.727
and I'm looking to share that
with you and your whore.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.538
(laughs)

14:32.572 --> 14:36.176
Well... looks like somebody's
been eating his spinach.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.610
(chuckles)

14:37.644 --> 14:39.178
Oh, no, it's okay, folks.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.413
It's all right.
The show's not over,

14:41.447 --> 14:44.451
but there will be
a short intermission.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.784
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Security to E.R.

14:45.817 --> 14:48.187
Don't want to miss
the second act.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.289
All kinds of excitement.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.793
I'll be there.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.871
How is she?

15:05.904 --> 15:07.706
She's fine.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.208
She's asleep.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.977
Well, you seem
all right, too.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.644
Yeah.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.147
What happened?

15:14.181 --> 15:16.216
When we left her,
she was fine. Did Faith...

15:16.249 --> 15:17.649
Faith's out of the picture.

15:17.683 --> 15:20.620
Buffy put her
in a coma.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.288
And?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.756
Buffy cured me.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.994
Made me...

15:27.027 --> 15:29.129
You fed off her.

15:30.629 --> 15:31.965
Yes.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.000
How much?

15:34.033 --> 15:35.668
She's gonna be fine.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.136
WILLOW:
She won't be a vampire?

15:37.169 --> 15:40.974
No. She didn't
feed off me.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.808
Well, it's just good to know
that when the chips are down

15:42.841 --> 15:45.111
and things look grim, you'll
feed off the girl who loves you

15:45.144 --> 15:46.645
to save your own ass.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.250
You better go, Angel.
We'll watch over her.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.552
I don't want to...
The sun'll be up soon.

16:05.697 --> 16:08.268
Gosh, I'm really gonna
miss him when he leaves town.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.302
Let's find out
how Buffy's doing.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.259
(meows)

16:33.393 --> 16:35.361
Who's gonna look after him?

16:35.394 --> 16:37.496
FAITH:
It's a she.

16:37.529 --> 16:40.799
And aren't these things supposed
to take care of themselves?

16:40.832 --> 16:43.336
A higher power
guiding us?

16:43.370 --> 16:46.605
Pretty sure
that's not what I meant.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.510
There's something I'm
supposed to be doing.

16:51.543 --> 16:55.347
Oh, yeah. Miles to go.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.250
Little Miss Muffet
counting down

16:57.283 --> 16:58.817
from 730.

16:58.850 --> 17:01.421
Great. Riddles.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.556
Sorry.

17:03.590 --> 17:07.094
It's my head.
A lot of new stuff.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.329
They're never gonna
fix this, are they?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.299
What about you?

17:14.267 --> 17:16.336
Scar tissue.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.204
It fades. It all fades.

17:21.807 --> 17:24.277
You want to know
the deal?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.444
Human weakness.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.448
It never goes away.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.482
Even his.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.786
Is this your mind or mine?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.388
Beats me.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.295
Getting towards that time.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.931
How are you gonna
fit all this stuff?

17:44.963 --> 17:46.432
Not gonna.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.634
It's yours.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.304
Oh, I can't use all of this.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.606
Just take what you need.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.810
You ready?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.846
(indistinct chatter on P.A.)

18:28.840 --> 18:30.843
*

18:53.400 --> 18:55.402
*

19:08.480 --> 19:09.781
Buffy.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.017
Are you okay?

19:11.049 --> 19:12.285
How do you feel?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.053
Is Angel here?

19:14.086 --> 19:16.355
He had to go.
It got kind of sunny.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.025
Get him. Get everyone.

19:19.057 --> 19:20.527
What exactly is up?

19:20.559 --> 19:22.060
Buffy, are you sure
you're all right?

19:22.094 --> 19:24.896
I'm ready.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.366
Ready for what?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.670
War.

19:55.694 --> 19:59.198
That's the basic plan.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.032
So, am I crazy?

20:01.067 --> 20:04.069
Well, "crazy"
is such a strong word.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.938
Let's not rule it out, though.

20:05.971 --> 20:07.406
You don't think it can be done?

20:07.440 --> 20:08.840
Oh, I didn't say that.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.742
I might, but not yet.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.444
I personally
don't think it's possible

20:12.479 --> 20:14.212
to come up
with a crazier plan.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.883
We attack the mayor with hummus.

20:18.116 --> 20:19.586
I stand corrected.

20:19.618 --> 20:20.819
Just keeping things
in perspective.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.756
Thank you.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.857
My point, however,
is, crazy or not,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.859
it's pretty much the only plan.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.930
Besides, it's Buffy's,
and she's slay gal.

20:30.962 --> 20:33.932
You know, Little Miss
Likes To Fight, so...

20:33.965 --> 20:36.603
I think there was a "yea" vote
buried in there somewhere.

20:36.635 --> 20:39.204
I'm gonna need every
single one of you on board.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.906
Especially you, Xander.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.209
You're sort of the
key figure here.

20:43.241 --> 20:46.613
Key? Me?

20:46.645 --> 20:50.215
Okay, pride, humility...

20:50.249 --> 20:52.050
and here's
the mind-numbing fear.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.720
What do I have to do?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.121
Do you remember any of your
military training

20:55.153 --> 20:56.655
from when you became
soldier guy?

20:56.689 --> 20:59.392
Ooh! Rocket launcher?

20:59.425 --> 21:01.093
Rocket launcher
not gonna get it done.

21:01.126 --> 21:02.595
I mean, it took a volcano

21:02.628 --> 21:04.262
to kill one of these things
last time.

21:04.297 --> 21:07.098
Um, Buffy, uh...

21:07.133 --> 21:08.968
all this is rather dependent

21:09.000 --> 21:12.739
on your being able
to control the mayor. Um...

21:12.771 --> 21:16.107
Faith told me to play
on his human weakness.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.609
Faith told you?

21:17.644 --> 21:20.145
Was that before or after
you put her in a coma?

21:20.179 --> 21:22.648
After.
Oh.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.116
His weakness?
BUFFY: Right.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.118
Which is?

21:27.153 --> 21:30.789
You know, I do all this
planning-- I'm in charge here,

21:30.823 --> 21:33.192
even though
I'm really not at my best...

21:33.224 --> 21:35.961
Well, uh, let's-let's, um...

21:35.994 --> 21:37.797
let's think.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.098
Well, Angel, you hung with him
the most. Was there something

21:40.132 --> 21:41.834
that he's
afraid of?

21:41.867 --> 21:44.503
Well, he's not crazy
about germs.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.439
Of course. That's it.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.340
We'll attack him with germs.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.009
Great. We'll get him cornered,
and then you can sneeze on him.

21:51.042 --> 21:53.880
No. No, we'll get
a container of Ebola virus,

21:53.913 --> 21:55.882
and-and, um...

21:55.914 --> 21:57.616
Or it doesn't even
have to be real.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.386
We can just get a box
that says Ebola on it

22:00.420 --> 22:03.021
and, um... chase him.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.460
With the box.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.496
I'm starting to lean towards
the hummus offensive.

22:09.528 --> 22:10.663
He'll never see it coming.

22:10.696 --> 22:11.830
Faith.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.200
Faith?

22:14.232 --> 22:15.867
At the hospital,
he was grieving--

22:15.902 --> 22:18.037
seriously crazed-- and
not just in a homicidal

22:18.069 --> 22:20.172
"I want to be a demon" way.

22:20.205 --> 22:22.474
She's his weak link.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.310
Faith.
I can work that.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.146
You haven't an enormous
amount of time.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.616
Hey, it's
Mr. States The Obvious.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.552
The Council is not welcome here.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.521
I have no time for orders.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.490
If I need someone to scream like
a woman, I'll give you a call.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.527
I'm not here
for the Council.

22:40.559 --> 22:43.663
Just tell me how I can help.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.266
That is so classy.

22:47.298 --> 22:49.402
Isn't he just so classy?

22:52.038 --> 22:54.773
It's a start.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.676
So, there is
something I can do?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.278
Besides scream like a woman.

23:00.311 --> 23:03.214
There's plenty.
There's chores for everyone.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.951
Okay, this is how
it's gonna lay out.
This is how it's gonna lay out.

23:05.984 --> 23:09.521
The transformation
should begin at exactly 3:28.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.191
I'll just be finishing
my speech. You know,

23:12.223 --> 23:14.226
it's too bad you fellas
are gonna have to miss that,

23:14.259 --> 23:16.394
'cause I think it speaks
to every one of us.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.396
I mean, heck, I've been working
on it for a hundred years.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.299
Better be good.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.201
They'll try to run, of course,

23:23.234 --> 23:26.372
and that's when I need you
boys in flanking position.

23:26.404 --> 23:27.807
But, sir, the sun.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.407
Not a problem.

23:29.442 --> 23:33.211
"Darkness will follow.
 The day becomes night."

23:33.244 --> 23:36.147
An eclipse.
Standard procedure
for an ascension.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.817
That puts me
back in the game.
Yeah, it does.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.886
You and Xander are gonna
have to work together now.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.253
Can you guys
handle that?

23:42.288 --> 23:44.923
I'm still key guy, right?
Right.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.493
Great. Then Angel,
in his non-key guy capacity,

23:47.527 --> 23:48.894
can work with me.
What fun.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.162
Hey, key guy's still talking.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.463
Oh, that's good,
start bickering.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.798
That's gonna
work great for us.

23:52.832 --> 23:56.234
You guys are like
little old ladies.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.104
WILKINS III:
 You'll come up through
 the sewers here.

23:58.136 --> 23:59.905
The important thing
is containment.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.673
I'll need to feed.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.809
It's crucial,
in the first few minutes,

24:03.843 --> 24:06.178
to sustain the change.
What does that mean?

24:06.211 --> 24:08.615
No snacking.
I see blood on your lips,

24:08.647 --> 24:11.182
it's a visit to
the woodshed for you boys.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.786
Kill.
Don't feed.

24:13.819 --> 24:15.755
So, how are we
on volcano detail?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.289
I think we can work it out.
Fun with chemistry.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.492
Xander said he should be
able to get the materials.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.628
Who's gonna
stoke it up?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.195
You feel up to it?

24:24.230 --> 24:25.765
I suppose it
should be I.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.834
Strangely fitting, in
a grotesque fashion.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.701
Okay, guys,
start reaching out.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.137
Giles. Weapons,
weapons, weapons.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.539
Uh, what about you?

24:33.573 --> 24:35.173
There's something
I need to get.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.476
Remember,
fast and brutal.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.778
It's gonna be a whole new world
come nightfall.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.448
Don't want to weaken now.
And, boys...

24:42.480 --> 24:44.683
let's watch the swearing.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.823
Harmony, listen, I need
to talk to you for a sec.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.858
You mean, in front
of other people?

24:56.261 --> 24:58.897
(sighs) Are they serious?
I'm gonna look stupid in this.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.231
Percy.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.634
Do I look stupid
in this? Be honest.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.103
You look great.
You got a sec?

25:17.616 --> 25:19.184
Cordelia.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.486
Yes?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.690
You know that
when this is over...

25:23.722 --> 25:24.691
Yes?

25:24.723 --> 25:27.693
Um, well, should we prevail,

25:27.727 --> 25:29.895
I'll be going back to England.

25:34.532 --> 25:37.502
I know.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.406
With Buffy no longer
working for the Council,

25:41.440 --> 25:44.943
there's really
no place for me here.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.150
I guess not.

25:53.551 --> 25:56.355
No...

25:56.387 --> 25:57.957
reason to stay.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.128
No.
No.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.530
No cause

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566
to hope that...

26:10.903 --> 26:13.071
I might be needed.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.641
Needed.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.710
Or wanted.

26:17.743 --> 26:18.911
Wanted.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.782
Good luck in England.
Mm, yes, thank you.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.584
I'll, uh, I'll drop you
a line sometime.

26:58.616 --> 27:01.119
That'd be neat.
(short chuckle)

27:12.832 --> 27:15.334
Okay, put these
with the others.
You got it.

27:15.366 --> 27:18.003
Don't touch anything.
What do we
do then?

27:18.037 --> 27:19.305
Nothing.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.373
Just relax.
Have a good time.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.109
Uh... okay.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.144
Okay, it's clear.
Let's move.

27:28.881 --> 27:32.284
I guess that's it.
Won't be long now.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.618
You nervous?

27:33.652 --> 27:36.654
Only in a terrified way.

27:38.589 --> 27:40.459
We're gonna
make it through this.

27:40.491 --> 27:42.493
Are you sure?

27:42.528 --> 27:44.797
I sound pretty sure, don't I?

27:44.830 --> 27:45.832
Yeah.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.334
Well, then I must be sure.

27:48.366 --> 27:52.270
Is that just a comforting way
of not answering the question?

28:01.913 --> 28:04.682
How long till graduation?

28:04.717 --> 28:06.719
Little while.

28:13.224 --> 28:14.760
Did you get
what you needed?

28:14.794 --> 28:16.028
Yeah, I did.

28:16.061 --> 28:17.829
This isn't gonna
be enough.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.231
Yeah, Giles is on it.
How are you?

28:23.434 --> 28:26.538
I heal fast.
Like you.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.409
So, are we sure that
everyone's good with their...

28:30.442 --> 28:32.979
I'm not gonna say good-bye.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.089
If we get through this,

28:44.123 --> 28:46.224
I'm just gonna go.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.596
You understand?

28:57.769 --> 28:59.270
There's just too much to...

29:14.286 --> 29:16.288
*

29:37.476 --> 29:39.478
(processional music playing)

30:02.567 --> 30:05.503
Congratulations
to the class of 1999.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.773
You all proved
more or less adequate.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.776
This is a time
of celebration,

30:10.808 --> 30:13.578
so sit still and be quiet.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.816
Spit out that gum.

30:17.849 --> 30:21.720
Please welcome our
distinguished guest speaker,

30:21.752 --> 30:23.955
Richard Wilkins III.

30:23.990 --> 30:27.659
I saw that gesture.
You see me after graduation.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.002
Am I late? Did we fight?

30:41.707 --> 30:43.442
(clears throat)

30:46.945 --> 30:49.815
Well.

30:49.847 --> 30:53.152
What a day this is.
A special day.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.554
Today is our centennial--

30:55.586 --> 30:58.690
the 100th anniversary
of the founding of Sunnydale,

30:58.723 --> 31:00.992
and I know what that
means to all you kids.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.194
Not a darn thing.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.730
'Cause today,

31:05.763 --> 31:07.499
something much more
important happens.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.868
Today, you all graduate
from high school.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.538
Today, all the pain,
all the work,

31:13.571 --> 31:16.107
all the excitement
is finally over.

31:16.142 --> 31:19.244
Now, what's 100 years
of history compared to that?

31:19.278 --> 31:21.047
My God.
Do you know what,
kids?

31:21.079 --> 31:23.249
He's gonna do
the entire speech.

31:23.281 --> 31:26.018
Man, just ascend already.
Maybe
the two things connect.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.287
Evil.
Maybe you have a place
in Sunnydale's history,

31:28.319 --> 31:30.689
whether you like it or not.

31:30.721 --> 31:32.723
It's been a long road
getting here--

31:32.758 --> 31:35.693
for you, for Sunnydale.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.628
There's been achievement,

31:37.663 --> 31:40.231
joy, good times.

31:40.266 --> 31:44.869
And there's been grief.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.006
There's been loss.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.410
Some people who should
be here today...

31:51.442 --> 31:53.511
aren't.

31:56.647 --> 31:58.884
But we are.

31:58.916 --> 32:00.885
Journey's end.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.288
And what is a journey?
Is it just

32:03.321 --> 32:05.223
distance traveled?

32:05.257 --> 32:08.227
Time spent? No.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.163
It's what happens on the way.
It's the things that shape you.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.432
At the end of the journey,
you're not the same.

32:13.464 --> 32:15.834
Today is about change.

32:15.866 --> 32:19.070
Graduation doesn't just mean
your circumstances change.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.271
It means you do.

32:20.306 --> 32:23.509
You ascend
to a higher level.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.779
Nothing will ever be the same.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.816
Nothing.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.625
(grunts)

32:43.729 --> 32:47.465
And so, as we look back on...

32:52.738 --> 32:55.707
...on the events that have
brought us to this day...

32:57.175 --> 32:58.443
Come on.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.378
We...

33:01.646 --> 33:04.150
We must all...
(screams)

33:08.987 --> 33:11.656
It has begun.
My destiny.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.028
It's a little sooner
than I expected.

33:16.061 --> 33:18.829
I had this whole section
on civic pride.

33:20.932 --> 33:24.001
But I guess we'll just
skip to the big finish.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.007
(groaning)

33:35.580 --> 33:37.583
(roaring)

33:56.201 --> 33:58.436
(roaring)

33:58.470 --> 34:00.471
(all clamoring, screaming)

34:10.815 --> 34:13.219
(growling)

34:23.393 --> 34:25.297
Now!

34:32.338 --> 34:34.072
Flame units.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.244
(shrieking)

34:41.112 --> 34:42.481
First wave.

34:44.681 --> 34:45.983
Fire!

34:46.016 --> 34:46.985
Go, go, go!

34:47.018 --> 34:48.186
(roaring)

34:55.927 --> 34:59.697
This is...
this is simply unacceptable.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.637
(growling)

35:06.672 --> 35:08.005
(screaming)

35:08.039 --> 35:10.041
XANDER:
Close ranks!

35:12.010 --> 35:14.012
Xander.
Bowmen.

35:22.387 --> 35:23.688
Fire!

35:25.023 --> 35:26.824
(grunting)

35:31.730 --> 35:32.998
Fall back.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.132
XANDER:
Fire!

35:45.210 --> 35:46.844
(grunting)

36:01.360 --> 36:02.728
(crack)

36:02.760 --> 36:04.929
(growling)

36:11.836 --> 36:15.474
This is not orderly.
This is not disciplined.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.376
You're on my campus, buddy,

36:17.409 --> 36:19.945
and when I say
I want quiet, I mean...

36:23.681 --> 36:26.418
Fall back! Get back!

36:26.452 --> 36:28.018
Go.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.088
Good luck.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.090
Xander, take 'em down.

36:32.123 --> 36:34.925
Everyone, hand-to-hand!

36:34.960 --> 36:38.063
Go, go, go! Move, move!

36:47.438 --> 36:49.775
Get the kids!

36:51.309 --> 36:52.744
(yelling)

37:00.552 --> 37:01.786
(screams)

37:05.657 --> 37:07.592
Right flank, close that up!

37:07.626 --> 37:10.961
Close! Jason and Doug,

37:10.996 --> 37:12.597
you guys are the right flank!

37:23.309 --> 37:25.476
Get some help here?

37:28.414 --> 37:30.416
BUFFY:
Hey!

37:32.418 --> 37:35.487
You remember this?

37:35.521 --> 37:37.956
I took it from Faith.

37:37.989 --> 37:39.990
Stuck it in her gut.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.262
Just slid in her
like she was butter.

37:46.130 --> 37:48.599
You want to get it
back from me...

37:48.634 --> 37:50.369
Dick?

37:51.637 --> 37:52.670
(roaring)

38:09.954 --> 38:11.056
(roaring)

38:31.009 --> 38:32.242
Well, gosh.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.181
(roaring, screaming)

38:56.101 --> 38:58.103
(moaning)

39:02.340 --> 39:04.543
If-if I could just
get something for the pain?

39:04.576 --> 39:07.545
It-it's rather a lot
of pain, actually.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.514
Aspirin?

39:09.547 --> 39:11.983
Anyone? Oh.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.686
Perhaps I could just
be knocked unconscious.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.722
(groaning)

39:24.963 --> 39:27.432
Got off pretty cheap,
considering.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.568
Seems like we did.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.612
He made it through
the fight.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.684
I guess maybe he...

39:45.717 --> 39:47.719
he took off after.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.065
Good job.
(indistinct conversations)

40:03.835 --> 40:05.202
Are you all right?

40:05.235 --> 40:07.572
I'm tired.

40:07.606 --> 40:10.240
I should imagine so.
It's quite a couple of days.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.480
I haven't processed
everything yet.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.114
My brain isn't really
functioning

40:16.146 --> 40:17.949
on the higher levels.

40:17.983 --> 40:21.385
It's pretty much,
"fire bad, tree pretty."

40:21.418 --> 40:23.387
Understandable.

40:23.420 --> 40:24.722
Well, when it's working again,

40:24.755 --> 40:26.757
congratulate it on a...
a good campaign.

40:26.791 --> 40:28.226
You did very well.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.561
Thank you. I will.

40:30.596 --> 40:34.065
I, um, I ferreted this
out of the wreckage.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.467
Um, it may not
interest you, but, uh...

40:38.469 --> 40:40.472
I'd say you earned it.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.648
There's a certain, um...

40:49.681 --> 40:52.282
dramatic irony
attached to all this.

40:52.317 --> 40:55.420
A synchronicity
that borders on-on...

40:55.452 --> 40:58.422
predestination,
one might say.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.025
Fire bad. Tree pretty.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.661
Oh, yes. Sorry.

41:02.693 --> 41:04.496
I'll go and
attend to Wesley.

41:04.530 --> 41:07.666
See if he's still,
um, whimpering.

41:21.311 --> 41:23.313
*

42:22.708 --> 42:25.710
Well, that was
the most fun you can have

42:25.744 --> 42:27.713
without having any fun.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.547
What about the part
where we kicked some demon ass?

42:30.581 --> 42:32.784
I didn't hate that.
XANDER: Hear, hear.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.286
You guys want
to take off?

42:36.320 --> 42:37.789
I think we've
pretty much

42:37.822 --> 42:39.523
done everything
we can.

42:39.556 --> 42:41.259
I'm for it.

42:41.291 --> 42:43.460
Are you okay?

42:46.797 --> 42:49.768
Yeah. I'm okay.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.202
I could use a little
sleep, though.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.539
Yeah.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.541
If someone could just
wake me when it's time

42:56.574 --> 42:59.077
to go college,
that'd be great.

42:59.110 --> 43:02.112
Guys, take a moment
to deal with this.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.481
We survived.

43:05.951 --> 43:08.585
It was a hell
of a battle.

43:08.619 --> 43:11.088
Not the battle.

43:12.289 --> 43:13.523
High school.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.831
We're taking a moment.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.534
And we're done.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.137
Well,
school's done.

43:27.172 --> 43:29.807
That was so cool.

43:29.840 --> 43:31.643
WILLOW:
Why do demons even come here?

43:31.677 --> 43:34.112
I mean, don't they know
how bad we are?

43:34.144 --> 43:36.146
*

44:21.760 --> 44:24.161
Grr. Argh.
