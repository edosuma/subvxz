This sucks.

00:06.674 --> 00:07.633
I know.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.259
I wish we were old enough

00:07.675 --> 00:09.259
to drive.

00:09.301 --> 00:11.261
Then we'd never be bored.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.516
I wish I could

00:13.472 --> 00:15.516
get out on my own

00:15.557 --> 00:18.978
and make a bunch of money

00:15.557 --> 00:18.978
and start the party.

00:22.105 --> 00:25.359
I wish I was a bird.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.358
We're going bowling tonight

01:03.605 --> 01:06.358
with some kids from school.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.110
It's, like, four boys and six,

01:06.400 --> 01:09.110
you know, girls.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.278
Not that I care.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.739
Doesn't make

01:10.320 --> 01:11.739
any difference to me.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.114
Why can't I go bowling, too?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.701
Because you are

01:13.156 --> 01:15.701
spending the night

01:13.156 --> 01:15.701
in your room.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.952
You are being punished.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.954
And tomorrow you are

01:16.994 --> 01:18.954
going to the store

01:18.996 --> 01:21.122
and buying Mrs. McNabb

01:18.996 --> 01:21.122
a new parakeet!

01:21.164 --> 01:22.624
Aw, Dad?

01:21.164 --> 01:22.624
Don't look at me.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.125
As far as you boys

01:22.666 --> 01:24.125
are concerned,

01:24.167 --> 01:25.502
your mom and I

01:24.167 --> 01:25.502
are a united front.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.212
We're ready.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.212
Who's going to drive us?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.130
I'll do it.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
You, to your room. March!

01:31.174 --> 01:32.384
Come on, son.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.719
Race you to your room.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.137
Oh, boys, you are going

01:33.761 --> 01:36.137
to have so much fun.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.848
One complaint

01:36.179 --> 01:37.848
about your behavior

01:37.890 --> 01:40.141
and I'll come down

01:37.890 --> 01:40.141
on you like a hammer.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.810
Bowling strikes,

01:40.183 --> 01:41.810
picking up spares...

01:41.852 --> 01:43.729
And when you're

01:41.852 --> 01:43.729
getting ready to roll,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.313
the girls will be

01:43.771 --> 01:45.313
in back of you,

01:45.355 --> 01:46.648
checking out

01:45.355 --> 01:46.648
the old hinder.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.149
This is one

01:46.690 --> 01:48.149
of the last places

01:48.191 --> 01:49.484
you haven't

01:48.191 --> 01:49.484
been banned from,

01:49.526 --> 01:51.319
so unless you want

01:49.526 --> 01:51.319
to spend your Saturday nights

01:51.361 --> 01:53.154
in the Laundromat,

01:51.361 --> 01:53.154
you'd better behave.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.156
Do I smell cologne?

01:55.198 --> 01:57.117
Very sophisticated.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.746
Is this Irving Street?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.957
I've never seen

02:00.788 --> 02:02.957
that church before.

02:02.998 --> 02:06.167
Let's see, we were supposed

02:02.998 --> 02:06.167
to take the second left

02:06.209 --> 02:08.837
after we went over the

02:06.209 --> 02:08.837
bridge, and then...

02:08.879 --> 02:12.173
Oh, geez, how's anybody

02:08.879 --> 02:12.173
supposed to find this place?

02:12.215 --> 02:13.174
Here we are.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.217
This is good, Mom.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.218
You can drop us off here.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.762
Yeah, you don't

02:15.260 --> 02:16.762
need to come in.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.346
We can walk

02:16.804 --> 02:18.346
the rest of the way.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.765
Oh, I understand.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.643
You're at that age where

02:19.807 --> 02:22.643
I'm an embarrassment to you.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.478
Hi. I need

02:22.684 --> 02:24.478
two pair of shoes--

02:24.519 --> 02:25.854
size seven

02:24.519 --> 02:25.854
and size nine.

02:25.896 --> 02:26.605
Coming up.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.565
Where did

02:26.647 --> 02:28.565
all my money go?

02:28.607 --> 02:30.067
I've only got six dollars?

02:30.109 --> 02:33.194
Uh... just give me

02:30.109 --> 02:33.194
one pair, size eight.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.571
You boys can share.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.406
But Reese isn't

02:34.613 --> 02:36.406
wearing any socks.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.409
I'm not sticking my socks

02:36.448 --> 02:39.409
in those nasty shoes.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.999
Ha-ha! See?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.667
Told you we'd find it.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.378
Now let's just get you

02:46.708 --> 02:50.378
set up with some shoes.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.213
Ooh! Pricey.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.298
Good thing

02:52.255 --> 02:53.298
I stole some cash

02:53.340 --> 02:55.216
from your mom's wallet

02:53.340 --> 02:55.216
this morning.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.593
LOIS:

02:55.258 --> 02:56.593
Go to sleep.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.428
I don't want to hear

02:56.635 --> 02:58.428
another peep out of you.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.805
It's not fair.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.057
I don't want

02:59.847 --> 03:02.057
to go to sleep early.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.601
Fine. Feel free

03:02.099 --> 03:04.601
to lie awake all night.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.811
Okay, go to sleep.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.022
I don't want to hear

03:05.853 --> 03:08.022
a peep out of you.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.230
It's not fair.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.732
I don't want

03:09.272 --> 03:10.732
to go to sleep early.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.233
We're not debating this.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.443
I'm serious, Dewey.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.820
I don't want any trouble

03:13.485 --> 03:14.820
with you.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.156
That means no pleading,

03:14.862 --> 03:17.156
no whining, no crying.

03:20.199 --> 03:24.454
You do understand why we're

03:20.199 --> 03:24.454
doing this, don't you, son?

03:27.290 --> 03:29.250
MALCOLM:

03:27.290 --> 03:29.250
Hey, check it out.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.251
Beth Ballard's here.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.419
REESE:

03:30.293 --> 03:31.419
Yeah.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.881
I hear she's why

03:31.461 --> 03:33.881
Mr. Thomas got fired.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.049
You can go now.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.257
Thanks for the ride.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.258
Where are the parents?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.635
Are there no parents here?

03:38.677 --> 03:39.636
Mom, please don't...

03:39.678 --> 03:41.262
LOIS:

03:39.678 --> 03:41.262
Where are your parents?

03:41.304 --> 03:42.472
Who's chaperoning this?

03:42.514 --> 03:44.183
Mom, we don't need

03:42.514 --> 03:44.183
a chaperone.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.308
Okay, it's me.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.519
We got two lanes here--

03:45.350 --> 03:47.519
let's use them!

03:47.561 --> 03:50.313
You, you, you, you and you,

03:47.561 --> 03:50.313
you'll use that lane.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.648
You five use this one.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.192
Mom, please don't do this.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.275
Are you kidding?

03:54.317 --> 03:55.276
You guys are bowling.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.530
You could cut the hormones

03:55.318 --> 03:58.530
around here with a knife.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.074
I mean, what kind of parent

04:00.115 --> 04:02.701
would leave these kids

04:00.115 --> 04:02.701
alone with themselves?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.452
Okay, I'll see you

04:02.743 --> 04:04.452
in a couple hours.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.080
Hey, there's

04:06.121 --> 04:06.914
Beth Ballard.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.957
Did you see that?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.957
She smiled at me.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.292
Hate to break it to you,

04:08.999 --> 04:11.292
but she was smiling at me.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.460
Okay, fine.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.462
Let's both go talk

04:12.502 --> 04:14.462
to her and find out.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.131
Sounds fair.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.299
Hey, Beth.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.010
Hi, Reese.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.178
Having fun?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.262
I guess.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.722
I'm kind of surprised

04:22.303 --> 04:23.722
to see you here.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.890
I mean, you're too cool

04:24.932 --> 04:26.225
to have to go

04:24.932 --> 04:26.225
to a bowling party.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.603
Well, I could say the same thing

04:26.266 --> 04:29.603
about you.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.980
Hey, I've got a great joke.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.733
How would you like

04:32.022 --> 04:34.733
to take a walk on the beach,

04:34.775 --> 04:38.319
feel the salt spray in your face

04:34.775 --> 04:38.319
and the wind in your hair?

04:38.361 --> 04:40.280
Sure. I guess.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.324
Looks like you already have!

04:43.366 --> 04:44.826
What's the matter with you?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.745
You spit on me, you pig!

04:47.829 --> 04:50.249
What? Don't you get it?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.708
Yeah, just one game.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.252
Oh, can you put me

04:51.750 --> 04:53.252
down at the end?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.420
See, my kids are here

04:53.293 --> 04:55.420
with a bunch of friends,

04:55.462 --> 04:56.922
and, you know, some are girls.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.506
I don't want

04:56.964 --> 04:58.506
to cramp their style.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.717
That's just not me.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.343
And another thing--

05:02.385 --> 05:04.054
the next person

05:02.385 --> 05:04.054
who swears

05:04.096 --> 05:06.140
is getting their

05:04.096 --> 05:06.140
parents called.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.432
You can count on it.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.350
I want to see a

05:07.474 --> 05:09.350
little daylight

05:07.474 --> 05:09.350
between you two.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.852
Let's go, Malcolm.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.852
You can do it.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.020
You're not

05:10.894 --> 05:12.020
going to throw

05:12.062 --> 05:13.396
another gutter

05:12.062 --> 05:13.396
ball this time.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.023
Mom, just let me bowl.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.317
Okay, okay.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.323
That's a good effort, Malcolm.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.203
Yes!

05:29.412 --> 05:30.413
Nice roll.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.539
Thanks.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.374
And you're pretty good, too.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.253
I've got a

05:33.416 --> 05:36.253
joke for you.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.173
Would you like

05:36.295 --> 05:39.173
to take a walk

05:36.295 --> 05:39.173
on the beach...

05:39.214 --> 05:40.381
LOIS:

05:39.214 --> 05:40.381
Reese!

05:40.423 --> 05:42.050
You're up!

05:44.594 --> 05:46.387
(phone ringing)

05:46.429 --> 05:47.555
Oh.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.266
Hello.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.391
Hey, Dad. I need a favor.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.685
Let's hear it.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.394
Well, some of the other cadets

05:53.436 --> 05:55.438
are going in together

05:53.436 --> 05:55.438
on an old car,

05:55.480 --> 05:56.397
and if I put in $100

05:56.439 --> 05:58.399
I get the car

05:56.439 --> 05:58.399
every seventh weekend.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.567
I could take road trips

05:59.609 --> 06:01.402
and go on dates.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
I could drive underprivileged

06:01.444 --> 06:03.404
children to cultural stuff.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.405
Oh, come on, Francis.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.406
That's ridiculous.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.700
I'm not giving you the money

06:06.741 --> 06:08.576
to buy one-seventh

06:06.741 --> 06:08.576
of a piece of junk.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.329
Okay. Just thought I'd ask.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.997
Later, Dad.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.997
Bye.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.832
Hey, Mom, I need a favor.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.876
Sure. Let's hear it.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.252
Well, some of the other cadets

06:17.294 --> 06:18.879
are going in together

06:17.294 --> 06:18.879
on an old car

06:18.920 --> 06:20.005
and if I put in 100 bucks

06:20.047 --> 06:21.506
I get the car

06:20.047 --> 06:21.506
every seventh weekend.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.799
Get back in there!

06:22.841 --> 06:24.259
I could take road trips

06:22.841 --> 06:24.259
and go on dates.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.928
I could drive underprivileged

06:24.301 --> 06:26.928
children to cultural stuff.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.680
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.598
I really don't think

06:28.722 --> 06:30.598
we can afford this right now.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433
Of course.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.433
I knew you'd say that.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.434
Why do I even try?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.895
Now you can go to bed happy,

06:34.936 --> 06:37.647
knowing that you kept my life

06:34.936 --> 06:37.647
a living hell!

06:40.483 --> 06:43.028
Maybe the lane

06:40.483 --> 06:43.028
is warped.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.363
Mom, please.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.865
You're not that

06:44.403 --> 06:46.865
bad of a bowler,

06:44.403 --> 06:46.865
Malcolm.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.033
I know you're not.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.617
What are you doing?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.617
Try this one.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.952
It's a lighter ball.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.620
Mom, this is

06:50.994 --> 06:52.620
a little kid's ball.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.206
LOIS:

06:52.662 --> 06:54.206
Just do it. Try it.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.427
MAN:

07:05.800 --> 07:08.427
Pick a lane!

07:13.141 --> 07:14.559
Your brother's

07:13.141 --> 07:14.559
not very good.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.936
Maybe you should help him.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
Nah. I couldn't

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
do that in front

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
of everybody.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.647
I'm kind of his hero.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.482
It would just

07:19.689 --> 07:21.482
embarrass him.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.650
That's sweet.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.568
You know, you never

07:23.610 --> 07:25.653
told me that joke.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.653
Oh, right.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.656
Would you like to take

07:25.695 --> 07:28.656
a walk on the beach,

07:28.698 --> 07:30.075
feel the salt spray...

07:30.117 --> 07:31.785
LOIS:

07:30.117 --> 07:31.785
Reese, you're up!

07:54.724 --> 07:56.935
Yeah!

08:21.876 --> 08:24.838
Pop 'em and drop 'em.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.923
(Dewey sobbing)

08:26.965 --> 08:29.259
I'm not buying it.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.552
(sobbing)

08:31.594 --> 08:33.347
What's wrong, son?

08:33.388 --> 08:34.555
Nothing.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.558
Oh. Hey, you want me

08:34.597 --> 08:37.558
to read you a story?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.559
No.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.727
Oh, come on.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.938
Hey, I'll read you

08:39.769 --> 08:41.938
"Wilbur the Worried Worm."

08:41.980 --> 08:43.564
You love that.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.732
Let's see, where...

08:44.774 --> 08:46.776
Hey, here it is.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.570
How about that?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.948
Okay.

08:51.990 --> 08:56.370
"There once was a worried

08:51.990 --> 08:56.370
little worm named Wilbur."

08:56.411 --> 08:58.246
Oh, perfect.

08:59.622 --> 09:05.379
"Wilbur lived in a magic garden

08:59.622 --> 09:05.379
filled with beautiful flowers.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.671
One day..."

09:06.713 --> 09:09.007
(snoring)

09:26.107 --> 09:27.234
Ha-cha!

09:35.658 --> 09:36.826
Man, six strikes.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.619
You're on your way

09:36.868 --> 09:38.619
to a perfect...

09:38.661 --> 09:40.455
(blubbering)

09:40.497 --> 09:42.082
Hey.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.624
Oh, hi.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.876
Sorry about my brother.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.379
We try to limit

09:44.918 --> 09:47.379
his contact with humans.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.215
Don't worry.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.215
You still look great.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.426
You're not very much

09:50.257 --> 09:52.426
like him, are you?

09:52.467 --> 09:54.135
No.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.188
You're so cute.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.864
(exclaiming)

10:20.787 --> 10:22.205
(grunts)

10:42.100 --> 10:44.894
I hate bowling.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.894
I love bowling.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.612
(snoring)

10:53.653 --> 10:55.322
Medium with thick crust,

10:55.363 --> 10:59.159
mushroom, pepperoni...

10:55.363 --> 10:59.159
and extra cheese, please.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.457
Ah.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.338
Gesundheit.

11:16.843 --> 11:21.640
I am the mayor of Strike Town.

11:16.843 --> 11:21.640
Yah!

11:49.584 --> 11:50.751
Are you deaf?

11:50.793 --> 11:51.752
What?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.338
I guess that's a yes

11:53.380 --> 11:56.757
to the "do you like

11:53.380 --> 11:56.757
my lip gloss?" question.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.967
Yeah. Uh, yes.

11:58.009 --> 12:01.137
I mean, why wouldn't I say yes

11:58.009 --> 12:01.137
to anything you ask?

12:01.179 --> 12:02.389
Hey, not bad.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.266
You're a pretty smooth talker.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.810
What else are you good at?

12:07.852 --> 12:10.980
A lot of things.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.774
So, how about you

12:11.022 --> 12:13.774
pick... one thing?

12:13.816 --> 12:15.776
Maybe I will.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.404
Maybe I'd like that.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.779
Maybe you would.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.407
My roll.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.658
Maybe it is.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.870
I just can't seem

12:21.700 --> 12:25.870
to stop talking like this.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.455
Stop talking

12:25.912 --> 12:27.455
like that, Malcolm.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.290
You can do this--

12:27.497 --> 12:29.290
now, just remember,

12:29.332 --> 12:31.209
bend your knee

12:29.332 --> 12:31.209
on the follow-through.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.793
And remember to keep

12:32.835 --> 12:34.128
your elbow in.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.796
Why don't you just kill me

12:34.170 --> 12:35.796
and get it over with?

12:35.838 --> 12:36.797
Come on, I'm trying

12:35.838 --> 12:36.797
to help you.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.799
Can't I at least use

12:36.839 --> 12:38.799
a boy's ball?

12:38.841 --> 12:40.468
No. You've knocked

12:38.841 --> 12:40.468
over five pins

12:40.510 --> 12:42.637
since you switched

12:40.510 --> 12:42.637
to that ball.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.614
Aw...

13:00.655 --> 13:02.407
You must really want

13:00.655 --> 13:02.407
out of this room

13:02.449 --> 13:04.325
to draw such

13:02.449 --> 13:04.325
a manipulative picture.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.452
Mm-hmm.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.084
Go to sleep, sweetie.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.711
(doorbell rings)

13:14.753 --> 13:17.046
(snoring)

13:18.881 --> 13:20.258
That's $11.50.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.843
I gave all my cash

13:20.300 --> 13:22.843
to the video guy.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.679
Do you take credit cards?

13:24.721 --> 13:25.680
Yeah.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.181
Is one enough?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.851
Better make that two.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.103
Thank you.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.279
Gesundheit.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.576
(cheering)

13:47.368 --> 13:49.162
Oh, oh, wait.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.162
Where are you going?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.122
I have to use the restroom.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.122
No, no, no.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.457
Nobody leaves.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.457
But I...

13:52.499 --> 13:53.667
No, no, no, please, please,

13:53.708 --> 13:54.875
everything's got

13:53.708 --> 13:54.875
to stay the same.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.085
Please, I need you here.

13:56.127 --> 13:59.255
I've never... I've never been

13:56.127 --> 13:59.255
this close before.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.881
You are a part of this.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.717
You're all

14:02.759 --> 14:04.010
a part of this.

14:04.051 --> 14:08.889
Each a thread in a fabric

14:04.051 --> 14:08.889
of the perfect game.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.350
Oh, sure,

14:08.931 --> 14:10.350
it'll be my name

14:10.391 --> 14:12.893
up there on that plaque

14:10.391 --> 14:12.893
by the men's room door,

14:12.935 --> 14:14.562
but each of you know

14:12.935 --> 14:14.562
in your heart

14:14.604 --> 14:15.896
that you had a vital role

14:14.604 --> 14:15.896
Okay, okay.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.482
in my success...

14:15.938 --> 14:17.482
Okay.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.817
Okay!

14:19.776 --> 14:21.528
Just... go quick.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.737
Okay, thank you.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.113
Thank you.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.880
Gesundheit.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.010
(cheering)

14:46.052 --> 14:47.387
Two to go.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.096
What's their problem?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.098
Yeah. It's just bowling.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.099
Relax.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.934
I wish we could be

14:52.141 --> 14:53.934
alone somewhere.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.103
Like outside?

14:56.145 --> 14:58.147
No. There's security

14:56.145 --> 14:58.147
cameras out there.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.440
Trust me.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.331
You see, Malcolm?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.957
Isn't it great

15:15.373 --> 15:16.957
when you don't have

15:16.999 --> 15:18.125
to worry about

15:16.999 --> 15:18.125
the gutters?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.419
You can just bowl

15:18.167 --> 15:19.419
and have fun.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.962
I wish we could be

15:19.460 --> 15:21.962
alone somewhere.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.256
Me, too.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.342
Wait, I still have

15:23.297 --> 15:26.342
to tell you that joke.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.637
Would you like to take

15:26.384 --> 15:29.637
a walk on the beach,

15:29.679 --> 15:32.265
feel the salt...

15:32.306 --> 15:33.974
You know what?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.394
That's not a good joke.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.979
Mom, I don't want to do this.

15:39.021 --> 15:39.814
Malcolm, I didn't

15:39.021 --> 15:39.814
raise you

15:39.856 --> 15:41.691
to stop trying when

15:39.856 --> 15:41.691
something is hard.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.150
You can do this.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.985
You just concentrate

15:43.192 --> 15:44.985
on those pins.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.195
You throw the ball.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.573
You are not giving up

15:46.237 --> 15:48.573
until you bowl a strike.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.157
Your mother's right, Connie.

15:50.199 --> 15:53.202
My name's not Connie!

15:53.244 --> 15:54.579
Okay, Mom,

15:54.621 --> 15:57.206
you want to see a strike?!

15:57.248 --> 15:58.999
Malcolm, what

15:57.248 --> 15:58.999
are you doing?

15:59.041 --> 16:00.000
Look at me!

16:00.042 --> 16:01.377
I'm the world's greatest bowler!

16:01.419 --> 16:04.004
I care so much about bowling!

16:04.046 --> 16:06.215
Bowling is so important!

16:06.257 --> 16:08.384
Malcolm, come back here!

16:08.426 --> 16:09.469
You want a strike?

16:09.510 --> 16:11.011
I'll give you a strike!

16:11.053 --> 16:13.222
Here's your damn strike!

16:15.057 --> 16:17.977
(laughter)

16:27.278 --> 16:29.572
Way to go, Connie!

16:30.323 --> 16:32.199
Listen, maybe

16:30.323 --> 16:32.199
you shouldn't...

16:32.241 --> 16:34.201
(chanting):

16:32.241 --> 16:34.201
Connie, Connie.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.954
Connie, Connie, Connie.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.205
Connie, Connie, Connie...

16:38.247 --> 16:40.124
Oh, man, that

16:38.247 --> 16:40.124
was classic.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.084
Okay, let's go make out.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.419
I don't think so.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.880
...Connie, Connie, Connie,

16:45.922 --> 16:48.048
Connie, Connie...

16:48.090 --> 16:49.342
Okay, I think bowling's over.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.468
Get your jackets.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.553
I'm taking

16:50.510 --> 16:52.553
everyone home.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.475
Turn in the shoes.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.270
I'll meet you out front.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.946
(loud rattling

17:05.900 --> 17:09.946
of pins and machinery)

17:09.988 --> 17:11.990
See? Nobody's here.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.491
Yeah.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.245
(shouting):

17:15.117 --> 17:18.245
You know, I think

17:15.117 --> 17:18.245
you're really cute.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.873
Thanks.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.708
You're cute, too.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.250
(cheering)

17:23.292 --> 17:25.962
HAL:

17:23.292 --> 17:25.962
Only one more.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.097
Okay, I'm going for it.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.809
I'm totally going

17:37.139 --> 17:39.809
to kiss her.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.360
Gesundheit.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.079
(cheering)

18:04.542 --> 18:06.544
That counts, right?

18:06.586 --> 18:09.129
300.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.965
It has to count.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.302
3-0-0.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.973
(chanting alone):

18:15.344 --> 18:18.973
3-0-0.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.810
3-0... oh!

18:25.563 --> 18:27.189
What's going on?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.567
I haven't heard a peep

18:27.231 --> 18:29.567
out of you in over an hour.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.527
I'm kind of tired.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.154
But you haven't tried

18:31.569 --> 18:34.154
your fake running away

18:34.196 --> 18:35.197
or your sleepwalking yet.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.241
It's not like you

18:35.239 --> 18:37.241
to give up so easily.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.576
Hmm.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.827
Maybe you've finally learned

18:39.869 --> 18:41.412
that all those silly

18:39.869 --> 18:41.412
little games you play

18:41.454 --> 18:43.163
aren't going

18:41.454 --> 18:43.163
to get you anywhere.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.331
I guess.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.750
When you're punished

18:44.373 --> 18:45.750
in this house

18:45.792 --> 18:47.334
you're going to serve

18:45.792 --> 18:47.334
your time.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.003
There's no getting around it.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.090
Well, I suppose

18:49.796 --> 18:52.090
you've suffered enough.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.760
I guess there's no harm

18:52.131 --> 18:55.760
in 20 minutes of television.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.427
Okay.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.096
Wait a minute.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.556
Unless this is

18:58.137 --> 19:00.556
a new ploy.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.851
You get right back

19:00.598 --> 19:03.851
into bed, mister.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.103
Okay.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.270
No, no, hold on.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.397
I'm-I'm... I'm being ridiculous.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.024
Go, watch TV.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.360
Wait, not so fast.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.656
I'm not falling for it.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.032
I'm being ridiculous.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.451
But you are not

19:18.074 --> 19:20.451
getting away with it.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.828
Go, watch TV.

19:21.869 --> 19:22.495
No, stop, stop.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.038
Stay right where you are.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.123
Okay.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.582
Okay, I tell you what

19:25.164 --> 19:26.582
we're going to do.

19:26.624 --> 19:28.626
You are-are going

19:26.624 --> 19:28.626
to watch television.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.712
But it's going to be something

19:28.668 --> 19:31.712
you're not going to enjoy.

19:31.754 --> 19:32.588
C-SPAN.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.965
That ought to do it.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.218
Okay, who just won?

19:38.260 --> 19:40.179
I'm not sure.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.933
Hey, Mom, I've got

19:42.264 --> 19:43.933
to tell you--

19:43.975 --> 19:46.602
I wasn't on board

19:43.975 --> 19:46.602
at first with you staying,

19:46.644 --> 19:48.021
but tonight was...

19:48.062 --> 19:50.106
well, it was magic.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.695
Hi.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.321
What? You want

19:55.736 --> 19:57.321
to make fun of me, too?

19:57.363 --> 19:58.322
No.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.406
I just wanted

19:58.364 --> 19:59.406
to tell you

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
that I thought it was

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
really brave of you

20:01.283 --> 20:03.036
to stand up to your

20:01.283 --> 20:03.036
mom like that.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.078
And I also thought

20:04.120 --> 20:05.329
it was hilarious

20:05.371 --> 20:07.040
the way you didn't

20:05.371 --> 20:07.040
hit a single pin

20:07.081 --> 20:09.416
when you were, like,

20:07.081 --> 20:09.416
what, an inch away?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.335
Is there a point

20:09.458 --> 20:11.335
to all this?

20:11.377 --> 20:12.670
No.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.296
Do you want to kiss me?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.256
Why do you think

20:14.338 --> 20:16.256
you can come over here

20:16.298 --> 20:17.758
and make fun of me and...

20:23.389 --> 20:25.058
LOIS:

20:23.389 --> 20:25.058
Okay, that's it.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.266
Oh, for God's sake,

20:26.308 --> 20:28.061
you are worse

20:26.308 --> 20:28.061
than your father.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.270
You two are sitting

20:28.102 --> 20:30.270
on opposite sides

20:28.102 --> 20:30.270
of the car.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.273
Okay, fine,

20:30.312 --> 20:33.273
don't count it.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.734
But you and I both know

20:34.775 --> 20:37.486
that was a perfect game.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.244
Reese, get out

20:42.616 --> 20:45.244
of the photo booth!

20:47.205 --> 20:48.873
Uh, hi.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.333
You... you probably

20:48.915 --> 20:51.333
want your privacy.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.252
I'll get out

20:51.375 --> 20:53.252
of your way.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.296
(blow landing)

20:56.338 --> 20:58.507
(Reese screaming)

21:05.514 --> 21:08.308
(brakes squeaking)

21:08.350 --> 21:10.144
(car doors closing)

21:34.376 --> 21:36.254
So, how'd it go?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.798
Next time, you take 'em.
