WEBVTT

05:22.409 --> 05:24.628
What are you doing here?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.587
Dreaming.

08:31.206 --> 08:34.209
Well, welcome to paradise.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.645
It's nice.

08:37.647 --> 08:42.260
Paradise may be
inhabited by nesting animals
and two years of dust.

08:42.304 --> 08:45.568
Well, I'm not afraidof a little work.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.091
It's why we're here, right?

08:47.135 --> 08:48.615
Yeah.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.791
It's nice.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.662
-  Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.847
Where's Josh?

09:08.112 --> 09:09.461
Josh...

09:14.031 --> 09:15.642
Josh...

09:21.299 --> 09:23.737
Hey.
Are you coming in, bud?

09:27.305 --> 09:30.874
- I love how they look
right onto the forest.

09:30.918 --> 09:34.356
Makes it easier to see the bearsbefore they attack you.

09:37.664 --> 09:41.668
Hey, Josh, you're in chargeof smores tonight.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.453
Maybe later we'll getthe fire pit going, okay?

09:48.283 --> 09:49.893
You remember where your room is?

10:55.611 --> 10:57.091
This is my mom.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.488
Oh, um,
she's very pretty, Josh.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.163
Come here.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.730
No.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.602
I don't play.
I can dance...

11:33.736 --> 11:36.391
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.654
Okay, so we'regoing to take this hand.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.483
- Mm-hm.
- And put it right here.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.180
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

11:43.224 --> 11:46.662
Get ready, when I nod,you press down, okay.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.794
- Okay.
- So--

11:47.837 --> 11:49.621
- No, no.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.188
- That wasn't nodding.

11:51.232 --> 11:53.538
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

11:59.762 --> 12:00.937
Hey, I just want to say,

12:00.981 --> 12:03.113
I'm so happy that--

12:03.157 --> 12:04.245
Go have your own kid!

12:04.288 --> 12:07.291
- I'm so sorry.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.511
He's killing me,
I'm going to go talk to him.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.743
Um, no.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.005
This is not a toy.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.442
This stays downstairs,
okay, buddy?

12:30.532 --> 12:37.060
Josh... you know Gail isn't
trying to replace Mom, right?

12:42.196 --> 12:48.202
Okay.
Are you okay, by yourself?

12:48.245 --> 12:49.899
You want me
to leave the light on?

12:51.335 --> 12:53.816
- Josh?
- I'm not a baby.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.165
Okay.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.218
Goodnight.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.981
It's kinda quiet, huh?

13:28.024 --> 13:30.331
Peaceful, huh?

13:30.374 --> 13:34.335
Well, I was gonnasay terrifying but...

13:43.083 --> 13:46.216
You know, I just wanted to say

13:46.260 --> 13:49.698
I know a lot
of women wouldn't...

13:56.444 --> 14:00.535
Thank you, for letting meinto your family.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.841
Mm-hm.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.889
Josh... Josh... Josh...

14:12.852 --> 14:17.769
Josh... Josh...

14:18.988 --> 14:20.598
Josh...

14:35.613 --> 14:36.658
Joshy?

14:50.454 --> 14:52.108
Joshy?

14:58.027 --> 15:01.857
Hey, kiddo. It's me.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.902
Mom?

15:06.035 --> 15:07.080
Mom?

15:13.782 --> 15:17.133
He's never had nightmares
before, not like this.

15:17.177 --> 15:21.268
Mm... there is a theory
that suggests that we are

15:21.311 --> 15:24.010
all the characters
in our dreams, so,

15:24.053 --> 15:26.316
if Josh's mom is splitting,

15:26.360 --> 15:31.278
then could be he's just leavingbehind past trauma, so...

15:31.321 --> 15:33.236
Could be a really good thing.

15:35.021 --> 15:38.198
If this is a good thing,
I don't want to know
what a bad one is.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.176
Hey!

16:01.830 --> 16:03.440
Hey...

16:05.007 --> 16:06.574
For some reason
this is the only place

16:06.617 --> 16:09.229
you can get a single bar.

16:09.272 --> 16:12.754
And... it's gone.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.713
Well, no news
is good news, right?

16:21.067 --> 16:24.200
Well, he wants a new chorus

16:24.244 --> 16:26.028
and he wants me
to make it more clever.

16:26.072 --> 16:29.553
Alright, well, how about,
go and write your own song.

16:29.597 --> 16:34.950
I'm staying here with my kid...
and my girlfriend. Hmm?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.647
It's catchy but wordy.

16:38.736 --> 16:42.262
Hey... we got you this.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.133
It's just a present.

16:45.352 --> 16:46.788
Josh helped me pick it out.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.355
No, I didn't.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.531
Thanks, Josh.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.881
- I said, no, I didn't!
- Hey.

16:52.924 --> 16:57.146
Look, I'm going to tryto make it back tonight.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.931
But if I can't make it back,are you two going to be okay?

16:59.975 --> 17:03.022
We'll be fine... ish.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.241
- Ooh...

17:05.285 --> 17:07.635
- See, now that's clever.
- Mm-hm.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.029
We'll see you tonight.

17:38.100 --> 17:42.191
It's okay, just forest sounds,
nothing to be afraid of.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.063
How would you know?

17:44.106 --> 17:46.282
Well, you're right actually.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.764
Does Dad love you?

17:51.592 --> 17:53.768
Well, I hope so.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.770
It's not fair.

17:55.813 --> 17:59.078
- What's not fair?
- She's dead and you're...

17:59.121 --> 18:00.992
Go on. Why don't we...

18:01.036 --> 18:04.909
Hey. Josh! Josh!

18:04.953 --> 18:07.912
Hey! Hey!

18:07.956 --> 18:11.568
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:11.612 --> 18:13.222
Why'd you have to pick
our family?

18:13.266 --> 18:15.833
Okay, this is not funny.
I'm going to count to three.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.966
- Go have your own kid!
- Josh!

18:18.009 --> 18:19.837
Oh, my God!

18:21.622 --> 18:22.840
Oopsie.

18:24.494 --> 18:28.107
Okay. Okay, that's...
that's not funny, get out.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.152
Get up! Get up!

18:30.196 --> 18:33.503
That is not funny!
Okay, do not do that again!

18:43.339 --> 18:50.129
Hey, you know, I'm sorryif I scared you before.

18:50.172 --> 18:53.654
Josh, it's just
you really frightened me.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.832
You can't take a joke.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.587
Wow, this is prettyawesome, huh?

19:16.067 --> 19:18.069
Did you see
what happened to the trail?

19:19.201 --> 19:22.291
Hey, Josh, maybe don'tgo in there.

19:22.335 --> 19:23.945
What does that say?

19:27.775 --> 19:30.343
I don't know,it looks like Dreamcatchers.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.827
What's this?

19:36.871 --> 19:40.222
I don't know,some kind of crafty nonsense.

19:40.266 --> 19:44.531
Well, we probably
shouldn't be here,
this is somebody's place.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.447
What do you think's in here?

19:47.490 --> 19:49.188
-  Tetanus?
- Nope.

19:49.231 --> 19:52.191
There's no tetanus in here.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.845
But lots of stuff for sale.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.892
Some beautiful, some strange,

19:57.935 --> 20:01.374
some a little bit scary,some yummy.

20:01.417 --> 20:05.204
Ms. Ruth's wild berry jam.

20:05.247 --> 20:08.250
We're just looking for
the trail, actually.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.383
Like what scary stuff?

20:12.167 --> 20:13.734
Do I know you?

20:16.171 --> 20:20.349
You got smart little
jack rabbit eyes,
you a little jack rabbit?

20:20.393 --> 20:23.309
My mom and dad used to
live around here.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.093
My mom drowned in a pond.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.358
We should probably go, Josh.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.664
That was your mom?

20:34.189 --> 20:37.410
Come on, we got spirit traps,let me show ya.

20:37.453 --> 20:40.935
Um, Josh, come on.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.285
I'm not a baby.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.982
No, you're not a baby.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.333
And did you know
that the spirits

20:47.376 --> 20:49.378
wander through these woods?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.859
They like to linger
in old barns.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.819
They visit you in your sleep.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.691
In your dreams.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.956
Do you have bad dreams?

21:01.999 --> 21:04.045
Cause a spirit trap
will catch 'em!

21:04.088 --> 21:07.483
Listen, shh.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.269
Oh, my goodness!
They are in here right now!

21:10.312 --> 21:11.835
They're trying
to tell you something.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.838
Something very important.
They are saying,

21:14.882 --> 21:19.930
"Buy Ms. Ruth's
Wild Berry Jam."

21:21.367 --> 21:24.718
Ahh, come on.
I'm just playing with him.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.589
Okay. Come on.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.156
Trail picks up
right over there.

21:28.199 --> 21:29.853
- Great, thank you.
- Yeah.

21:29.897 --> 21:33.683
Hey, hey, hey!
Josh, is that your name?

21:33.727 --> 21:35.337
See you around,
little jack rabbit.

21:52.093 --> 21:54.269
Ms. Ruth was pretty cool.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.359
Uh, well,
she's pretty something alright.

21:57.403 --> 22:00.884
You don't believe that stuff
about spirit traps, do you?

22:00.928 --> 22:02.625
You know that's nonsense.

22:02.669 --> 22:06.716
She said they were real.She said they catch your dreams.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.631
You know how dreams work,
don't you?

22:08.675 --> 22:10.198
Yeah, they scarethe shit out of you.

22:10.241 --> 22:13.419
Hey, language.

22:13.462 --> 22:18.162
Josh, dreams don't come
from out here, alright.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.164
They come from in here.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.603
It's just your mind's wayof figuring out stuff

22:23.646 --> 22:25.169
that's going on in your life.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.346
So if you're havingsome bad dreams,

22:27.389 --> 22:30.827
it means you're probablydealing with some stuffthat's difficult.

22:30.871 --> 22:34.135
And you could talk about it.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.920
You don't want to talk about it,you could try drawing it up.

22:36.964 --> 22:41.055
You know, if you can see it,
sometimes it makes it
a little less scary.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.407
Helps you understand it,

22:45.451 --> 22:48.062
and maybe you can figure it outin your real life.

22:48.105 --> 22:51.326
- Does that make sense?
- I guess.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.548
I want to tell you something,
this is a secret.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.854
You're in control.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.117
Okay, so when
you're falling asleep,

23:00.161 --> 23:02.250
just think good thoughts
about your mom,

23:02.293 --> 23:05.862
you know, think about
some of the good times
that you guys had,

23:05.906 --> 23:09.518
and I promise you,
it'll be better.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.737
Okay?

23:13.087 --> 23:15.437
- What did I say?
- I'm in control.

23:15.481 --> 23:16.656
That's right.

23:17.570 --> 23:18.919
Say it a little bit louder.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.138
- I'm in control.
- Okay, scream it.

23:21.182 --> 23:24.968
- I'm in control!
- Yes!

23:27.144 --> 23:30.321
You are.
You're in control, Josh.

23:30.365 --> 23:34.238
- Can I get a dreamcatcher?
-  No way.

24:00.656 --> 24:05.313
You're looking at a man who's just written 16 versions of the same chorus.

24:05.356 --> 24:08.403
Well, I'm not looking at him,
cause you're not here.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.362
Listen, I'm sorry. How's Josh?

24:11.406 --> 24:14.278
He's good.
He's been talking about Becky,
which is good.

24:14.322 --> 24:18.805
He's been expressing
signs of anger,
so at least we're talking.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.285
It's raw, but I actually
think it's good.

24:23.374 --> 24:26.290
- Luke? Luke...

24:41.218 --> 24:42.916
If you guys
want to come back to the city

24:42.959 --> 24:45.309
- I can arrange for a car--
- No, what I'm saying is

24:45.353 --> 24:47.050
I think it's good
if we stay here.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.443
I think it's good for him.

24:53.404 --> 24:58.148
Luke, can you tell me again,
how Becky drowned?

25:06.113 --> 25:07.506
Joshy.

25:09.856 --> 25:13.773
Hey, kiddo. I've come
to take you home with me.

25:13.816 --> 25:18.255
I told you, she was swimming
and her heart just stopped.

25:18.299 --> 25:20.519
- Why does it matter?
- Well, it's just something

25:20.562 --> 25:23.870
that your neighbor Ruth said,
or maybe it's the way
she said it.

25:23.913 --> 25:26.046
Oh, fuck, not Ruth.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.135
Just do me a favor,
stay away from her.

25:28.178 --> 25:29.440
Don't be afraid.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.443
I'm your mommy.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.014
Seriously, do not talk to...

25:38.058 --> 25:41.148
- Gail... Gail...
- Hello?

25:42.192 --> 25:43.193
Luke?

26:12.048 --> 26:14.050
Hey. Hey, Josh.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.618
Hey, wake up.Wake up, buddy.

26:16.662 --> 26:20.535
Hey, hey. Hey.It's okay.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.712
It's just a bad dream.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.976
Just a dream.

26:27.020 --> 26:28.499
You okay?

26:42.426 --> 26:44.733
You know it's okayto be scared, don't you?

26:45.691 --> 26:46.866
Hm?

27:04.710 --> 27:05.885
Josh?

27:09.671 --> 27:10.672
Josh?

27:41.398 --> 27:45.533
Hey, what are you doing here,
little jack rabbit?

27:47.883 --> 27:51.365
Just trying to findsome spirit traps.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.716
Maybe you better go home.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.677
You come backwith the lady you were with.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.375
Tell her Ms. Ruthaccepts cash only.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.248
Will you please help me?

28:07.033 --> 28:09.513
Are you okay?

28:09.557 --> 28:12.647
Do all these catch bad dreams?

28:12.691 --> 28:17.826
Uh, some do,
some catch evil spirits.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.916
Some catch bad energy.
Some catch dreams.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.745
Gail says we control
our own dreams.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.748
She says all this stuff
is nonsense.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.750
She does, does she?

28:28.794 --> 28:32.319
She's a child psychologist.
She knows stuff like that.

28:32.362 --> 28:35.975
- Yeah.
- Anyways, that's why
she's trying to fix me.

28:39.326 --> 28:43.373
- Are you broken?
- Sometimes.

28:43.417 --> 28:47.943
You know what,sometimes we're all broken.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.556
Take off this pack.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.384
Sit yourself down.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.082
Here, put these on.

28:56.125 --> 28:59.259
I'm going to show you
how to fix some stuff.

29:09.269 --> 29:12.315
So, we use this,
then I won't hurt my fingers,

29:12.359 --> 29:14.709
and I probably won't need to
wear gloves when I do it.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.538
Great job!
I betcha this one will sell.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.235
What do you think?

29:19.279 --> 29:21.977
Why'd you scratch out
the dreamcatchers on your sign?

29:24.327 --> 29:27.635
Well, I don't makedreamcatchers anymore.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.463
Just spirit traps...

29:29.506 --> 29:31.291
Hey, Josh,

29:31.334 --> 29:32.466
what are you doing here?

29:32.509 --> 29:34.511
Can we please get one?

29:34.555 --> 29:37.427
Okay, wait outside.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.735
- Go on.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.915
Well, your little friend
sure wants something.

29:48.830 --> 29:52.834
You know,
some people might find

29:52.878 --> 29:56.229
this kind of thing offensive.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.100
Misappropriating
other people's cultures.

29:58.144 --> 30:01.234
Excuse me,nobody's got the market cornered

30:01.277 --> 30:03.018
on protecting themselves
from evil.

30:03.062 --> 30:06.674
You know, all cultures
have a way to trap bad things.

30:06.717 --> 30:10.547
This is called a Ojos de Dios.

30:10.591 --> 30:14.290
Here's one from Scotland.
It's called a Rowan cross.

30:14.334 --> 30:19.513
And I have a book to show you.
I know you like books.

30:19.556 --> 30:23.343
People always find a way
to ward off what scares them.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.998
And don't touch anything,
please.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.262
Yeah...

32:09.188 --> 32:13.192
You are nosy, aren't you?
Do you mind putting that back?

32:19.676 --> 32:21.200
Is Noah your son?

32:21.243 --> 32:23.071
Was my grandson.

32:23.115 --> 32:26.857
He's dead, they're all dead!
Just like Josh's mother.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.731
Josh's dad told meabout the accident.

32:30.774 --> 32:32.951
Oh, is that what he called it?

32:34.126 --> 32:35.518
Get out.

32:44.266 --> 32:47.095
Never come back here again,got it?

32:56.583 --> 32:58.063
- Alright.

32:58.106 --> 33:00.065
Are you okay with the light out?

33:03.416 --> 33:04.634
Shut my door.

33:57.209 --> 34:02.997
Once upon a time, there was
a knight named Sir Josh,

34:03.041 --> 34:04.390
and he had a sword.

34:04.433 --> 34:08.350
- - Shh... shh... it's okay honey.

34:08.394 --> 34:11.005
- It's okay now.
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.790
It always starts like this
and then it turns into
a nightmare.

34:13.834 --> 34:15.444
- No--
- And then you get
all scary and--

34:15.488 --> 34:19.796
No, I'm not a nightmare,not anymore.

34:19.840 --> 34:24.627
Shh. Now that youhave the dreamcatcher,I can come home.

34:24.671 --> 34:25.976
Are you really here?

34:27.152 --> 34:30.720
Not yet.I'm just up here.

34:31.895 --> 34:34.898
I'm not strong enough yet.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.770
Are you hungry?
I'll go--

34:36.813 --> 34:38.424
I'll just eat you.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.883
Dad promised he'd be home.

35:02.926 --> 35:05.886
Well, I knowhe'll be back as soon as he can.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.978
We could go hiking again.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.547
Hiking's just walking.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.335
How'd you sleep?

35:23.208 --> 35:26.036
I saw my mom...in my dream.

35:29.039 --> 35:30.824
She read me a story.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.352
I'm hungry.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.922
Hey, I make a mean pancake.

35:44.185 --> 35:49.147
So when you dreamed
about your mom last night,
how was she?

35:49.190 --> 35:50.626
She was normal.

35:51.453 --> 35:52.976
She was pretty.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.196
She was happy.

35:57.981 --> 36:02.769
You know, I don't thinkthere's any pancake mix in here.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.771
I mean,
there's a little mouse poop.

36:04.814 --> 36:07.730
Ow! Ow...

36:09.471 --> 36:11.952
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

36:11.995 --> 36:14.650
- Leave this door open.
- I didn't do anything.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.349
- Josh.
- I said I didn't do anything!

36:17.392 --> 36:19.699
Hey, hey, hey, come back.

36:19.742 --> 36:23.311
Josh, come on, let's...
let's do something fun.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.353
Well, this is fun.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.834
Dad says not to talkwhile fishing.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.229
My mom died here.

37:12.839 --> 37:14.580
Who told you that?

37:14.623 --> 37:15.929
My mom.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.931
What do you mean?

37:17.974 --> 37:19.585
In my dream.

37:19.628 --> 37:22.675
She said that she was sorry
that she had to leave.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.633
But she said
when she comes back,

37:24.677 --> 37:27.462
she'll never ever
leave me again.

37:31.118 --> 37:33.338
Do you want to talk about it?

37:33.381 --> 37:36.210
It's like I know
she's always with me.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.779
But I just feel different.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.302
Is that normal?

37:44.697 --> 37:47.482
It's more than normal.

37:47.526 --> 37:50.964
It's very healthyand grown up.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.663
You don't have to do that.

37:55.795 --> 37:57.231
Do what?

37:58.319 --> 38:00.103
Act all cheerleadery.

38:00.147 --> 38:03.759
Like you're my mom.
I don't need a mom.

38:03.803 --> 38:08.024
Like I said, she'll always
be in here with me.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.419
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Ow! Ow!

38:11.463 --> 38:13.073
- I'm sorry!

38:13.116 --> 38:16.511
Stop! Let's just pausefor a minute, okay.

38:16.555 --> 38:18.426
Ow...

38:18.470 --> 38:20.254
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.996
Alright...

38:24.780 --> 38:26.913
-  Does it hurt?

38:30.569 --> 38:33.615
I'm sorry I hooked you.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.965
That's okay, sweetie,you didn't mean it.

38:37.750 --> 38:41.536
That's good.Ooh, thank you.

40:05.707 --> 40:08.318
Look, this is not a joke,mis...

41:05.419 --> 41:07.465
Okay, bed time.Turn it off.

41:07.508 --> 41:09.205
When's Dad coming?

41:09.249 --> 41:13.296
Josh, it's been a long day,please just turn it off.

41:21.783 --> 41:23.481
Why would you do thatwith the photos?

41:23.524 --> 41:25.961
- Do what?
- Don't lie to me, okay.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.615
I swear, I didn't do anything.

41:27.659 --> 41:29.443
Come on,I thought we were friends.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.489
I didn't do anything!

41:35.275 --> 41:36.319
Door!

42:03.172 --> 42:07.307
Josh, I said no iPad!

42:27.545 --> 42:31.592
Josh... hey.

43:09.587 --> 43:12.285
Dad said Gail loves me.

43:16.245 --> 43:18.987
She wants to kill you.

43:19.031 --> 43:20.772
She does?

43:22.643 --> 43:25.037
Honey, do you love me?

43:25.080 --> 43:26.865
Yes.

43:28.388 --> 43:30.477
Don't you want to see me again?

43:31.826 --> 43:33.219
Yes.

43:33.262 --> 43:37.397
When are you coming back...
for good?

43:37.440 --> 43:39.660
I'm not strong enough yet.

43:39.704 --> 43:41.923
So I need you to help me.

43:44.665 --> 43:47.276
You need to stop her.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.149
But she's nice,
she took me fishing.

43:50.192 --> 43:53.282
You can only love one of us.

43:53.326 --> 43:55.415
Those are
just the rules, Joshy.

44:06.208 --> 44:08.907
Gail, I'm sorry,
there's nothing I can do.

44:08.950 --> 44:10.691
They're making me
stay another night.

44:10.735 --> 44:12.954
I'm telling you I'm just going
to walk right out of here.

44:25.837 --> 44:27.229
How are you feeling?

44:28.753 --> 44:30.580
Hmm?

44:30.624 --> 44:34.149
I think it's goingto rain later,so it's probably an inside day.

44:36.717 --> 44:38.023
You alright?

44:38.066 --> 44:39.328
It's okay, don't move,

44:39.372 --> 44:40.939
I'll... I'll clean it up.

44:40.982 --> 44:42.680
Don't walk on this.

44:51.819 --> 44:54.692
Sorry, I just...I'm so tired.

44:55.954 --> 44:57.738
Whatcha been doing
this morning?

44:59.261 --> 45:02.787
Just doing the pictureslike you told me.

45:02.830 --> 45:04.266
Oh...

45:05.528 --> 45:08.444
So, tell me, what's this?

45:08.488 --> 45:10.882
That's Daddy, that's Mommy,and that's me.

45:10.925 --> 45:13.449
Oh, what's this one?

45:13.493 --> 45:15.713
-  This one?
- Yeah.

45:15.756 --> 45:18.933
- That's you.
- Who's this?

45:20.413 --> 45:21.849
That's your dead baby.

45:25.897 --> 45:28.290
Just my mindworking through things.

45:29.988 --> 45:35.210
Um... I'm just going to go
get your sneakers, okay,

45:35.254 --> 45:36.951
so don't move.

45:45.873 --> 45:50.486
Mm, just can't find that extra
pink piece for this.

45:50.530 --> 45:52.706
Does this one go there?

45:53.663 --> 45:57.189
Mm... no.

45:59.365 --> 46:01.106
You okay?

46:01.149 --> 46:03.412
Just a little bit tired.

46:04.674 --> 46:09.114
Me too.

46:23.302 --> 46:25.521
Me and my mom used to do this.

46:45.933 --> 46:47.413
You alright?

46:49.719 --> 46:52.853
Yeah. I think I need to goupstairs to bed.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.111
Okay, Mommy.

48:53.017 --> 48:54.496
Josh!

48:59.980 --> 49:01.112
Josh!

49:01.851 --> 49:04.680
Josh! Hey, Josh!

49:08.597 --> 49:09.947
- Josh!

49:11.687 --> 49:13.863
Sweetie?Hey, hey, hey--

49:13.907 --> 49:15.996
I saw my mommy!
She was killed!

49:16.040 --> 49:18.216
Hey, Josh.

49:18.259 --> 49:20.392
Sweetie. Josh!

49:20.435 --> 49:24.874
Josh. Hey, hey, Josh! Josh.

49:24.918 --> 49:28.008
Hey, you're dreaming.

49:28.052 --> 49:31.490
It's okay.It's okay, I'm right here.

49:31.533 --> 49:35.276
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

49:35.320 --> 49:38.671
It's okay. It's okay.

50:43.736 --> 50:46.173
Oh, my God!

50:51.135 --> 50:54.964
Hey, how you doing?

50:55.748 --> 50:57.228
I'm in control.

50:57.924 --> 50:59.578
Yeah, you are.

51:02.059 --> 51:03.669
There's honey in here.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.107
Ruth?

51:07.151 --> 51:08.630
Where is it?

51:08.674 --> 51:09.936
- No, don't go!
- Hey! What?

51:09.979 --> 51:11.242
- No, don't go!
- Hey, hey, hey,

51:11.285 --> 51:12.808
you can't just come
running in here.

51:12.852 --> 51:14.506
No, he broke into my barnand he took something!

51:14.549 --> 51:15.942
-  Josh?
-  Josh!

51:22.427 --> 51:24.081
Don't go away again, Mommy!

51:25.995 --> 51:29.173
Okay, Josh, did you takesomething from Ms. Ruth's barn?

51:30.913 --> 51:32.132
Okay, you need to give it back.

51:32.176 --> 51:33.742
No, no!
I don't want it back.

51:33.786 --> 51:35.527
But you need to listen.

51:35.570 --> 51:37.833
It was safe where it was,
but not anymore.

51:37.877 --> 51:39.922
You let it out,and now you're both in danger.

51:39.966 --> 51:42.011
You need to destroy it now!

51:46.364 --> 51:48.235
I don't need it anymore.

51:49.671 --> 51:51.934
You, stay here.

51:56.504 --> 51:58.419
Just tell me,
what happened to your family?

51:58.463 --> 52:01.074
What happened to Becky,
what happened to Noah?

52:01.118 --> 52:03.294
- Just tell me.- You're not hearing me, just...

52:03.337 --> 52:05.861
just throw it into the fire.
Burn it!

52:05.905 --> 52:08.429
Okay, fine!
I'll throw it in the fire.

52:17.525 --> 52:18.918
Little Noah...

52:21.703 --> 52:24.793
He was just
a regular little guy.

52:24.837 --> 52:28.188
He was smart, funny.

52:28.232 --> 52:32.149
Was a little bit quirky,
he liked odd things.

52:32.192 --> 52:35.935
He had a collection that
he called his "special stuff"

52:35.978 --> 52:39.373
that had dead animal fur,

52:39.417 --> 52:43.247
bones, dead bugs.

52:43.290 --> 52:47.947
His father would say,
"Get rid of that junk!

52:47.990 --> 52:52.560
Normal boys play sports
and they have friends."

52:55.520 --> 52:57.957
I was his friend.

53:02.266 --> 53:07.140
It was Christmas,
and I wanted to find
the perfect present,

53:07.184 --> 53:10.448
and there was a yard sale
down the street,

53:10.491 --> 53:13.015
and I found that thing.

53:15.061 --> 53:19.500
This crazy woman said to me, "Whoever hangs it in their room

53:19.544 --> 53:23.374
will be protected
from evil forever."

53:23.417 --> 53:27.291
I thought, the perfect present.

53:28.814 --> 53:30.816
Boy, was I wrong.

53:32.905 --> 53:34.863
Protect him from evil?

53:37.301 --> 53:39.390
It was pure evil.

53:40.304 --> 53:42.523
It devoured him,

53:42.567 --> 53:48.050
and then one day he followed
his parents into the woods,

53:48.094 --> 53:53.665
and this little boy
hacked them to death.

53:55.188 --> 53:57.321
Came upon them
all hacked to pieces.

53:59.323 --> 54:01.716
Except for Noah.

54:01.760 --> 54:04.284
Suddenly, he... he just leapt at me like a wild animal,

54:04.328 --> 54:07.766
and he was waving this axe,
screaming at
the top of his lungs.

54:07.809 --> 54:10.551
Make it get out!
Make it get out!

54:14.425 --> 54:17.123
And then he killed Josh's mom.

54:38.057 --> 54:42.801
Once upon a time,there was a boy named Josh,

54:42.844 --> 54:45.456
and he had a hatchet.

54:45.499 --> 54:47.762
As a psychotherapist,
I can tell you

54:47.806 --> 54:51.853
that kids have issues, alright.

54:51.897 --> 54:54.247
And using science,

54:54.291 --> 54:59.165
we just need to treat them
with therapy or with medicine,

54:59.208 --> 55:02.734
and this voodoo bullshit
it doesn't help.

55:02.777 --> 55:04.213
It doesn't help anyone.

55:06.215 --> 55:08.957
And I'm just suggestingthat you just drop it.

55:13.658 --> 55:15.399
Gail, help, I can't move!

55:15.442 --> 55:18.010
Shh!

56:06.537 --> 56:08.669
Sorry.
Hey.

56:13.065 --> 56:15.372
How could you just
leave us here?

56:15.415 --> 56:17.896
I had to go to the city.

56:21.465 --> 56:24.119
Why didn't you tell me
Becky was killed?

56:25.338 --> 56:26.383
What are you talking about?

56:26.426 --> 56:28.297
I read an article, okay.

56:31.431 --> 56:33.825
I don't... I don't likethinking about that.

56:33.868 --> 56:35.261
Okay, well that's something

56:35.304 --> 56:36.915
that you might
want to mention, alright.

56:36.958 --> 56:40.179
Yeah, I... I know.I'm sorry,I should have told you.

56:40.222 --> 56:43.400
Hey, hey, buddy!
I missed you.

56:45.271 --> 56:48.622
Uh, listen, Gail and I,
we have to talk for a minute,

56:48.666 --> 56:52.365
so, can you go in the kitchen
and fix me something to eat?
I'm so hungry.

56:52.409 --> 56:53.714
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

56:58.502 --> 57:01.287
How was it, how's he been?

57:01.330 --> 57:03.942
Uh, not good.

57:03.985 --> 57:05.378
He's been sleepwalking.

57:08.207 --> 57:10.427
Do you guys want some pie?!

57:10.470 --> 57:12.472
Uh, yeah, buddy.

57:12.516 --> 57:15.301
-  Sleepwalk?
- Yeah, that's the least
of his problems.

57:15.344 --> 57:17.303
He left the cupboard door
open on purpose

57:17.346 --> 57:19.871
so he could hit me
on the back of the head.

57:19.914 --> 57:22.787
He hooked me
with a fishing hook.

57:22.830 --> 57:25.442
Well, I'm... I'm sorryyou had a couple of accidents.

57:25.485 --> 57:28.445
It's not accidents.
I mean, I'm napping, I wake up,

57:28.488 --> 57:31.317
and I am covered
in a sea of Becky photos.

57:31.360 --> 57:34.276
- I don't understand.
- He slashes the scarf
that you gave me.

57:34.320 --> 57:37.279
He breaks into Ruth's barn.
She comes here--

57:37.323 --> 57:39.456
I... I told youto stay away from her.

57:39.499 --> 57:42.241
And... and kidspull pranks all the time.

57:42.284 --> 57:46.506
When I was a kid,I... I pulled pranks,I shoplifted once on a dare.

57:46.550 --> 57:49.161
- This is not a prank.- And I've slept walked before.

57:49.204 --> 57:50.815
Here, actually.

57:50.858 --> 57:52.817
I woke up in the...in the fucking woods.

57:52.860 --> 57:54.775
Do you want me
to show you the scarf?

57:54.819 --> 57:56.647
I don't need to see the scarf!

57:56.690 --> 57:59.388
I just want to have a weekend,
with my son

57:59.432 --> 58:02.479
with some quality time,
that's nice, where I can relax!

58:02.522 --> 58:04.350
I understand.What about me?

58:11.575 --> 58:13.272
Oh, thanks, buddy.

58:14.012 --> 58:15.492
Thank you, Josh.

58:17.668 --> 58:19.539
Can we go fishing tomorrow?

58:20.279 --> 58:21.802
Yeah, we'll see.

58:25.806 --> 58:29.157
Mmm, this is
pretty good pie, Joshy.

58:31.725 --> 58:35.990
Well, I'm glad you like it,'cause it's pretty muchall we have left.

58:38.602 --> 58:40.647
I'm sorry. It's just...

58:40.691 --> 58:43.128
It's just we've had a fewmisadventures, haven't we, Josh?

58:45.217 --> 58:46.435
Haven't we?

58:52.354 --> 58:53.878
Are you okay?

58:53.921 --> 58:55.183
Jesus Christ!

58:56.445 --> 58:58.230
- Did you do this!
- I didn't.

58:58.273 --> 59:00.232
- Gail, come on.
- Answer me!

59:00.275 --> 59:02.582
- I didn't.
- You tell me the truth.

59:02.626 --> 59:03.975
Gail, for God's sake!

59:04.018 --> 59:06.238
I said I didn't!
She hates me!

59:06.281 --> 59:08.936
Okay, we're so out of here.
Tonight!

59:23.472 --> 59:28.695
Josh... did Gail tell youabout the pond?

59:29.609 --> 59:30.871
About mom?

59:30.915 --> 59:32.046
No.

59:32.786 --> 59:33.918
Josh?

59:35.789 --> 59:37.748
I don't want to
get her in trouble.

59:37.791 --> 59:40.359
Goddamnit.

59:40.402 --> 59:43.536
Dad, I didn't do the thing
with the broken glass.

59:43.580 --> 59:46.147
I... I know you didn't, Joshy.

59:46.191 --> 59:53.241
Gail, she's just, uh...She's just confusedabout a lot of things.

59:53.285 --> 59:55.722
She told me
not to dream about mom.

59:55.766 --> 59:56.897
What?

59:58.116 --> 1:00:00.205
Said it was unhealthy.

1:00:00.248 --> 1:00:02.381
And it showed
a sign of weakness.

1:00:06.385 --> 1:00:08.082
You just get some sleep, pal.

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:25.056
Josh needs help, Luke.
More than I can give him.

1:00:25.099 --> 1:00:27.624
Wait, do you...you really think

1:00:27.667 --> 1:00:29.408
that he did thisto you on purpose?

1:00:29.451 --> 1:00:31.149
He broke a glass the other day,

1:00:31.192 --> 1:00:33.891
he probably took the glass
out of the trash.

1:00:33.934 --> 1:00:36.502
Yeah, what's... what's this?Huh?

1:00:37.938 --> 1:00:41.725
And you told himnot to dream about Becky?

1:00:41.768 --> 1:00:43.857
No, I didn't tell him that.

1:00:43.901 --> 1:00:45.642
Joshy said that you did.

1:00:45.685 --> 1:00:47.382
Joshy says that I did.
You're going to take

1:00:47.426 --> 1:00:50.211
a child's word over mine?
'Cause I am telling you,

1:00:50.255 --> 1:00:52.692
I'm telling you, professionally,he needs help.

1:00:52.736 --> 1:00:54.868
Kids have bad dreams.

1:00:54.912 --> 1:00:58.350
Maybe he needs to spendmore quality time with me.

1:00:58.393 --> 1:01:01.483
This is based on
your years of experience
working with troubled children?

1:01:01.527 --> 1:01:03.572
Based on the factthat he's my own goddamn son.

1:01:03.616 --> 1:01:05.879
I'm telling you,
he's traumatized!

1:01:05.923 --> 1:01:09.013
He's experiencing
latent violent tendencies,

1:01:09.056 --> 1:01:11.755
and you've got us
stuck here in this house

1:01:11.798 --> 1:01:14.583
where his mother was killed!
Are you fucking nuts?!

1:01:14.627 --> 1:01:16.237
No, he's not troubled!

1:01:16.281 --> 1:01:19.197
He's confused,he's six years old.

1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:21.286
Oh, Jesus Christ,
he's not six.

1:01:21.329 --> 1:01:24.028
- Yeah.
- No, he's not.

1:01:24.071 --> 1:01:26.508
No, I mean, I know...I know he's not six.

1:01:26.552 --> 1:01:28.206
Because you would
like him to be six.

1:01:28.249 --> 1:01:29.686
No, no, no, no.No, don't do this.

1:01:29.729 --> 1:01:31.122
Yeah. You would
like him to be six...

1:01:31.165 --> 1:01:32.776
Don't do this psychoanalyticalbullshit on me.

1:01:32.819 --> 1:01:33.907
...because then he could
still be your little Joshy,

1:01:33.951 --> 1:01:35.213
and Becky would still be alive.

1:01:35.256 --> 1:01:36.867
I get it. I get it.

1:01:36.910 --> 1:01:38.912
And we need to get
the fuck out of here.

1:01:38.956 --> 1:01:40.305
I'm not kidding!

1:02:08.768 --> 1:02:10.074
Honey...

1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:12.729
It's time.

1:02:15.601 --> 1:02:16.733
She's ready.

1:02:45.109 --> 1:02:46.588
Go on.

1:02:46.632 --> 1:02:49.374
- I don't want to.
- She took my place.

1:02:49.417 --> 1:02:52.420
- Hey, you said you hated her.
- I don't, not really.

1:02:52.464 --> 1:02:54.727
It's easy. Watch.

1:03:05.216 --> 1:03:06.913
Why'd you do that?!

1:03:09.481 --> 1:03:12.789
I didn't. You did.

1:03:12.832 --> 1:03:14.094
No!

1:03:21.058 --> 1:03:22.450
Hi, Gail.

1:03:37.857 --> 1:03:39.250
Luke?

1:03:40.512 --> 1:03:41.905
Luke?

1:03:58.878 --> 1:04:00.880
Hey, Luke.

1:04:00.924 --> 1:04:02.664
What's going on?

1:04:03.752 --> 1:04:05.667
What is this?

1:04:05.711 --> 1:04:07.278
I was letting you sleep in.

1:04:07.321 --> 1:04:09.367
Because we're gettingon the road, right?

1:04:09.410 --> 1:04:11.412
Babe, he's fine.
You're fine, right?

1:04:11.456 --> 1:04:13.893
Dad's going to teach me
how to chop some wood.

1:04:13.937 --> 1:04:15.852
We'll be careful,
we've got snacks.

1:04:15.895 --> 1:04:17.375
Listen, I want toget out of here.

1:04:17.418 --> 1:04:19.464
As soon as we get reception,I'm calling Dr. Fisher.

1:04:19.507 --> 1:04:23.120
I am going to spend
some time with my son.

1:04:25.078 --> 1:04:28.908
Twenty minutes,and then we're out of here.

1:04:28.952 --> 1:04:30.823
Are we going to chop
some wood now?

1:04:30.867 --> 1:04:33.826
Yeah, Josh, we're going to chopthe hell out of some wood now.

1:05:28.968 --> 1:05:31.971
- My turn.
- No, hey... Slow down.

1:05:32.015 --> 1:05:34.626
Safety first. Come here.

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:36.889
Put both hands on it.

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:40.414
Okay.Just little swings.

1:05:40.458 --> 1:05:44.418
Nice and easy.There you go. Okay?

1:05:45.811 --> 1:05:48.118
There you go.

1:05:48.161 --> 1:05:50.859
Nice and easy.Good.

1:06:02.828 --> 1:06:05.831
Now, Josh,I said to use both hands, son.

1:06:10.923 --> 1:06:14.144
Hey, Josh, I said...I said use both hands.

1:06:14.187 --> 1:06:16.494
Why didn't you tell me
how Mom died?

1:06:17.886 --> 1:06:19.671
- Okay--
- A little boy killed her.

1:06:19.714 --> 1:06:21.368
Hand that over.

1:06:21.412 --> 1:06:24.067
Okay, Josh, that's enough.

1:06:24.110 --> 1:06:25.503
You give me that.

1:06:26.547 --> 1:06:28.810
Damn it!Put that down, now!

1:06:28.854 --> 1:06:31.596
He threw her body into a pond.

1:06:31.639 --> 1:06:35.774
Just a boy.
A boy like me.

1:06:35.817 --> 1:06:40.039
Once upon a time,
there was a boy named Josh,

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:41.998
and he had a hatchet.

1:07:12.941 --> 1:07:14.291
Where's your Dad?

1:07:27.565 --> 1:07:28.957
What's this?

1:07:46.975 --> 1:07:48.194
Josh...

1:07:49.717 --> 1:07:51.371
Josh!

1:07:51.415 --> 1:07:53.156
Put that down!

1:07:53.199 --> 1:07:54.809
Josh!

1:07:56.202 --> 1:07:57.638
Josh!

1:08:00.598 --> 1:08:02.817
Okay...

1:08:02.861 --> 1:08:05.603
Remember... Can you remember
what we talked about?

1:08:05.646 --> 1:08:07.474
Okay, losing control?

1:08:12.436 --> 1:08:13.480
Josh?

1:08:28.191 --> 1:08:30.280
- No!

1:08:32.630 --> 1:08:35.807
No!

1:08:40.333 --> 1:08:44.120
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1:08:44.163 --> 1:08:46.644
What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

1:09:35.910 --> 1:09:37.434
What are you doing?

1:09:37.477 --> 1:09:39.958
Don't interrupt me.
It's for our own good.

1:09:43.614 --> 1:09:45.485
- Josh.
- Josh is dead.

1:09:45.529 --> 1:09:48.793
Josh, wake up.
Wake up, buddy.

1:09:51.709 --> 1:09:55.582
Josh! Your dad's coming back
and we're going to
get out of here.

1:09:55.626 --> 1:09:57.105
I don't think Daddy's coming.

1:09:57.149 --> 1:10:00.065
What are you talking about?

1:10:00.108 --> 1:10:02.546
Daddy wasn't safe
with the hatchet.

1:10:04.809 --> 1:10:06.332
It's not Josh.

1:10:08.291 --> 1:10:10.293
It's this!

1:10:10.336 --> 1:10:13.731
It can't be destroyed,
there's something
that is living in there.

1:10:13.774 --> 1:10:15.646
It is indestructible.

1:10:16.299 --> 1:10:18.039
Josh. Josh!

1:10:23.436 --> 1:10:25.612
I saw it.

1:10:25.656 --> 1:10:27.658
I saw it last night
in my sleep.

1:10:29.703 --> 1:10:31.618
And it was a woman.

1:10:32.402 --> 1:10:34.230
A miserable hag.

1:10:34.273 --> 1:10:37.320
Okay. Okay, Ruth.

1:10:37.363 --> 1:10:39.452
Now you can't possibly
believe this.

1:10:39.496 --> 1:10:43.195
She has Noah's soul
for eternity,
but now she has Josh.

1:10:44.675 --> 1:10:46.546
We have to kill him, Gail.

1:10:47.895 --> 1:10:49.462
You have to kill him.

1:10:50.376 --> 1:10:51.856
Or he's going to kill you.

1:10:51.899 --> 1:10:53.205
He's going to kill me.

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:55.163
He's going to killeverybody around us,

1:10:55.207 --> 1:10:58.341
and the evil is justgoing to keep comingand coming and coming!

1:10:58.384 --> 1:11:02.127
I understand. I understand.

1:11:02.170 --> 1:11:05.130
I'm going to help you, alright.

1:11:05.173 --> 1:11:08.481
But I can't help you,
unless you untie me.

1:11:09.526 --> 1:11:10.614
What's happening?

1:11:12.355 --> 1:11:14.226
Get away, I'm not going back in!

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.271
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

1:11:15.314 --> 1:11:17.664
Where is he?!Where is he?

1:11:17.708 --> 1:11:19.492
Is he in there?
You know where he is.

1:11:19.536 --> 1:11:21.407
Is my Noah in there?
Is he in pain?

1:11:21.451 --> 1:11:25.281
Of course, he's in pain,
can't you see he's sick?!
He needs a doctor!

1:11:25.324 --> 1:11:27.413
You think I'm trapped in that?

1:11:27.457 --> 1:11:29.589
That's my home,
we all live in there.

1:11:29.633 --> 1:11:31.983
- Waiting...
- Waiting for what?

1:11:32.026 --> 1:11:35.421
For a place to play.
But we got Noah.

1:11:35.465 --> 1:11:38.163
What fun we had with him.

1:11:38.206 --> 1:11:41.209
You let him go!
Don't you hurt him anymore!

1:11:41.253 --> 1:11:42.515
Fight it!

1:11:44.082 --> 1:11:47.172
Gail. Gail, what's happening?

1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.785
I don't know.
I don't know, Joshy.

1:11:51.829 --> 1:11:55.789
But I'm here.
I'm right here with you, okay.

1:11:55.833 --> 1:11:59.315
- Josh, is Noah in there?
- Just stop it!

1:11:59.358 --> 1:12:03.101
For God's sake!
What do you want?!

1:12:03.144 --> 1:12:05.799
It's not what I want, it's...
it's what that wants.

1:12:05.843 --> 1:12:07.366
Little boys just don't
become monsters.

1:12:07.410 --> 1:12:10.369
Oh, but they do...
they do, Ruth.

1:12:10.413 --> 1:12:13.154
And I'm sorry, I don't know
what happened to Noah.

1:12:13.198 --> 1:12:14.852
She knows what happened.

1:12:21.598 --> 1:12:23.208
Noah?

1:12:23.251 --> 1:12:26.516
At first it kinda tickles
when they're inside you.

1:12:27.691 --> 1:12:29.519
But then they start eating you.

1:12:30.737 --> 1:12:32.565
It hurts so much.

1:12:32.609 --> 1:12:36.482
But when you let them play,
they don't feed on you.

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:39.093
It's why they need us.

1:12:41.226 --> 1:12:42.923
You figured that much out.

1:12:49.408 --> 1:12:51.976
I did. I did.

1:12:54.413 --> 1:12:59.157
Just when I thought that
my life was over he stopped.

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:01.942
I thought he was
going to hug me.

1:13:01.986 --> 1:13:06.425
But instead,
he grabbed my wrist
and put the axe in my hand,

1:13:06.469 --> 1:13:10.473
drew it across his own throat.

1:13:10.516 --> 1:13:12.475
I watched him die, Gail.

1:13:12.518 --> 1:13:14.738
I killed my own grandson.

1:13:18.785 --> 1:13:20.874
I miss your hugs.

1:13:20.918 --> 1:13:22.659
Do you mean it, sweetheart?

1:13:22.702 --> 1:13:24.704
God, I've missed you so much.

1:13:30.928 --> 1:13:33.844
Josh! Sweetie, wake up!

1:13:33.887 --> 1:13:34.932
Oh...

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:43.549
Holy fuck.

1:13:44.332 --> 1:13:46.117
Josh. Josh.

1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:47.684
You're in control, Josh!

1:13:47.727 --> 1:13:50.251
Stop! Please!

1:13:51.252 --> 1:13:53.690
Josh, no!

1:14:01.175 --> 1:14:03.264
Josh, stop.

1:14:03.308 --> 1:14:05.049
Josh is dead!

1:14:08.139 --> 1:14:11.185
Sweetie... you're in control.

1:14:11.925 --> 1:14:14.493
Say it. Say it!

1:14:14.537 --> 1:14:16.539
I'm in control.

1:14:16.582 --> 1:14:21.065
No, no...
No, Joshy, there's
someone else inside of you.

1:14:21.108 --> 1:14:23.371
There's someone very sweet.

1:14:23.415 --> 1:14:25.678
Somebody who your Daddy loves.

1:14:25.722 --> 1:14:30.291
Remember? Remember how much
you love your daddy
and your mommy?

1:14:30.335 --> 1:14:32.163
Sweetheart, they love you.

1:14:32.206 --> 1:14:35.209
They love you so much.
I love you.

1:14:35.253 --> 1:14:37.081
I love you! I love you!

1:14:37.124 --> 1:14:39.213
I just wanted to be your mommy!

1:14:40.388 --> 1:14:41.868
- Mommy?

1:14:41.912 --> 1:14:43.653
Mommy?

1:16:36.809 --> 1:16:37.984
Hey, kid.

1:16:39.682 --> 1:16:41.031
You alright?

1:16:46.602 --> 1:16:48.995
Yeah, just a little tired.
