WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.503
The epic quest
for a massive meteorite.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.605
AGEE: Somewhere out there
in Oregon

00:06.740 --> 00:08.874
is this million-dollar
meteorite.

00:08.876 --> 00:11.076
The true story

00:11.178 --> 00:13.078
of Marco Polo.

00:13.213 --> 00:15.113
Was it fact
or was it fiction?

00:15.182 --> 00:18.016
And a celestial message
that's out of this world.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.820
This is the story
about space, aliens,

00:21.889 --> 00:24.222
and a love that will last
for eternity.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.959
These are the mysteries
at the museum.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.399
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.768
Ninety-two feet above
the Monongahela<i> </i> River

00:36.837 --> 00:39.705
are two enormous decommissioned
blast furnaces

00:39.707 --> 00:41.973
that were used in this city's
steel industry

00:42.042 --> 00:44.376
during the early 20th century.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.177
Today, these rusting behemoths

00:46.213 --> 00:48.447
sit amid 38 acres
of park land.

00:48.516 --> 00:52.250
But these aren't the only
dormant monsters in town.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.854
A few miles away is
an institution that
features other giants

00:55.989 --> 00:58.123
frozen in time --

00:58.192 --> 01:00.692
the Carnegie Museum
of Natural History.

01:03.564 --> 01:07.532
On display is an array
of gems and minerals

01:07.568 --> 01:09.902
from the state of Pennsylvania,

01:10.004 --> 01:11.937
preserved insects

01:12.072 --> 01:13.838
that are part of a collection
of some

01:13.874 --> 01:16.408
13 million invertebrates,

01:16.477 --> 01:19.811
and a taxidermy specimen
of the world's smallest owl,

01:19.847 --> 01:23.114
the elf owl.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.284
But one massive creature

01:25.386 --> 01:27.286
towers above them all.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.389
LAMANNA: It's 87 feet long
and weighed 15 tons.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.892
It is more than 150 million
years old.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.961
It stood on four legs,

01:36.030 --> 01:38.897
but no human has ever
seen one roaming around alive.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.369
WILDMAN: This dinosaur skeleton
tells the tale

01:44.505 --> 01:47.306
of one man's determination
to bring nature's giants

01:47.441 --> 01:49.241
back to life.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.643
This is a story about
a prehistoric discovery

01:51.712 --> 01:53.912
of gigantic proportions.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.050
WILDMAN: It's the 1890s.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.486
A new field of scientific
exploration is taking

02:01.489 --> 02:04.789
the nation by storm --
the study of dinosaurs.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.992
LAMANNA:
In the late 19th century,

02:07.061 --> 02:09.994
the first bones of truly
massive dinosaurs

02:10.030 --> 02:12.097
began to be discovered.

02:12.166 --> 02:15.000
WILDMAN: The craze had been
sparked some 30 years earlier

02:15.002 --> 02:17.869
when an amateur collector
found a relatively small

02:17.938 --> 02:20.338
set of fossils belonging
to a creature

02:20.407 --> 02:22.641
named Hadrosaurus.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.477
LAMANNA: In 1858, Hadrosaurus
was discovered in New Jersey,

02:26.514 --> 02:28.813
and this is an animal that's
probably the size of

02:28.849 --> 02:32.551
a small elephant, so by
dinosaur standards, not so big.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.520
WILDMAN: In the years
that followed,

02:34.622 --> 02:36.522
numerous sets of bones
were found,

02:36.624 --> 02:38.690
many of them hinting
at just how large

02:38.825 --> 02:40.692
some dinosaurs had been.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.962
But one thing eluded
the ardent fossil hunters--

02:44.064 --> 02:47.232
the full skeleton of
a really big dinosaur.

02:47.367 --> 02:50.635
LAMANNA:
The public had never seen one,

02:50.671 --> 02:53.105
mounted in all its glory
from head to toe

02:53.107 --> 02:55.007
in the halls of a museum.

02:55.109 --> 02:57.309
WILDMAN: In Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, one man

02:57.378 --> 03:00.445
is determined to get his hands
on a complete specimen.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.048
His name is William Holland.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.784
LAMANNA: William Jacob Holland
was the director

03:05.919 --> 03:09.087
of the Carnegie Institute,
and he was a renowned scholar

03:09.156 --> 03:11.590
in a number of fields --
undoubtedly, he wanted

03:11.659 --> 03:14.993
something spectacular to get
people coming in the door.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.465
WILDMAN: One day,
in late 1898,

03:20.501 --> 03:22.568
Holland gets some
thrilling news.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.003
A band of fossil hunters
digging in Wyoming

03:25.138 --> 03:27.539
claim to have discovered
the bones of a creature

03:27.641 --> 03:31.209
so enormous, it could peek
into an 11-story window.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.746
LAMANNA: Newspaper articles
were touting it

03:34.815 --> 03:37.482
as the largest dinosaur
that had ever been found

03:37.484 --> 03:39.651
and also quite complete.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.890
WILDMAN: Holland vows that
he will be the one

03:45.025 --> 03:47.426
to put this massive marvel
on display.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.428
Knowing that he won't be
the only museum in the hunt

03:50.464 --> 03:53.297
for the gigantic beast,
he agrees to buy the skeleton

03:53.334 --> 03:55.767
sight unseen.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.169
LAMANNA: Holland gets in touch
with the finder of

03:58.238 --> 04:01.640
the colossal animal, and he
secures the giant dinosaur.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.576
WILDMAN: The deal struck,

04:05.613 --> 04:07.712
Holland sends a team
of scientists to Wyoming

04:07.748 --> 04:10.048
to retrieve the dinosaur bones,

04:10.050 --> 04:12.183
but when they arrive
at the location,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.652
they are met
by a discouraging sight.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.221
The fossil collectors that
he'd hired reported

04:17.257 --> 04:19.591
back to him that the only thing
that had ever been found

04:19.726 --> 04:22.027
there was a single chunk
of thigh bone

04:22.029 --> 04:24.429
about the size of a beer keg.

04:24.564 --> 04:28.400
WILDMAN: The complete dinosaur
skeleton simply doesn't exist.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.637
LAMANNA: This must have been
very depressing to Holland.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.741
They had pinned their hopes
on this dinosaur

04:35.876 --> 04:37.942
from the newspaper,
and to find out

04:38.012 --> 04:41.413
that the story was essentially
made up had to be

04:41.415 --> 04:43.815
tremendously disappointing.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.418
WILDMAN: But the determined

04:46.553 --> 04:48.620
dinosaur hunter refuses
to give up.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.556
LAMANNA: Bringing back one of
these things was a long shot,

04:51.558 --> 04:54.025
but they wanted
the show-stopping dinosaur,

04:54.061 --> 04:56.427
a giant dinosaur,
a dinosaur that would put

04:56.463 --> 04:58.764
the Carnegie Museum
on the map.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.899
WILDMAN: What Holland does next
will cement his place
in the history books.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.569
LAMANNA: No one could know
how this would change

05:04.705 --> 05:06.672
the world of science.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.909
WILDMAN: Holland figures that
where there's one bone,

05:10.978 --> 05:12.911
there must be more,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.113
so he secures the rights
to excavate

05:15.149 --> 05:17.649
a vast swath of Wyoming
wilderness in the region

05:17.784 --> 05:20.485
where the first bone
had been found.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.722
Weeks go by as his team
of plucky paleontologists

05:23.824 --> 05:26.658
toils away in the dirt
in search of dinosaurs

05:26.793 --> 05:28.860
but to no avail.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.463
LAMANNA:
The team from Carnegie Institute
found a few decent fossils,

05:32.499 --> 05:35.600
but nothing that was gonna fill
the halls of the museum.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.336
WILDMAN:
But then, on July 4, 1899,

05:38.405 --> 05:41.873
Holland's team makes a discovery
of epic proportions.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.075
LAMANNA: After weeks

05:44.111 --> 05:46.945
of frustration,
they had found the skeleton

05:46.947 --> 05:49.581
of a giant,
long-necked dinosaur.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.817
WILDMAN:
The group gradually unearths

05:51.919 --> 05:54.686
a 150-million-year-old monster.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.557
This was certainly among
the most complete

05:59.593 --> 06:01.893
of the giant dinosaur skeletons
that had been found

06:01.895 --> 06:03.962
to that point,
so a real homerun

06:04.031 --> 06:06.865
for the Carnegie team --
they must have been filled
with elation.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.234
WILDMAN: And when they study
the specimen closely,

06:09.369 --> 06:11.903
they realize it is truly
one-of-a-kind.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.106
LAMANNA: This turned out to be
a brand-new species,

06:14.241 --> 06:16.474
never before seen by science.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.710
WILDMAN: In its day,
the herbivore would've weighed

06:18.812 --> 06:22.914
up to 15 tons and stretched
a whopping 85 feet

06:23.049 --> 06:25.217
from nose to tail.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.154
Over the course of
the next eight years,

06:30.190 --> 06:32.290
the dinosaur remains
are excavated,

06:32.359 --> 06:34.326
shipped to Pittsburgh,
and mounted,

06:34.428 --> 06:37.061
and in 1907,
named for the benefactor

06:37.131 --> 06:39.497
of the institution that made
the discovery,

06:39.500 --> 06:42.667
Diplodocus carnegii is
unveiled to the public.

06:42.803 --> 06:46.004
LAMANNA: The debut was
a smashing success.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.773
Certainly it had the effect
of attracting

06:48.809 --> 06:51.009
visitors by the hoards.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.612
WILDMAN: But this isn't the end
of this dino's story.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.284
LAMANNA: Within 20 years of
its discovery in 1899,

06:59.286 --> 07:02.420
there were copies of
Diplodocus carnegii on display

07:02.523 --> 07:05.089
in cities like Berlin,
Paris, Madrid,

07:05.125 --> 07:08.627
Bologna, Vienna, La Plata,
and Argentina.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.629
WILDMAN:
Eventually, the Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, institution

07:11.665 --> 07:15.033
is renamed the Carnegie Museum
of Natural History.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.670
Today, this massive Diplodocus
skeleton, affectionately

07:18.805 --> 07:21.273
nicknamed Dippy, is on display,

07:21.275 --> 07:23.909
a reminder of the rewards
that await those

07:24.044 --> 07:26.445
who are willing to dig
a little deeper.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.383
The city of
Pasadena, California,

07:32.419 --> 07:34.986
is home to the longest
continually operating

07:35.055 --> 07:38.323
comedy club in the world --
the Ice House.

07:38.325 --> 07:41.392
This legendary venue
opened in 1960

07:41.428 --> 07:44.462
and since then has hosted
such household names

07:44.598 --> 07:47.465
as Jerry Seinfeld,
David Letterman,

07:47.467 --> 07:49.901
and Ellen DeGeneres,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.671
but on the edge of town
is a scientific institution

07:52.673 --> 07:54.973
that is no laughing matter --

07:54.975 --> 07:57.275
the NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.681
It's the nation's leading center
for robotic space exploration.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.018
Visitors can marvel
at a piece of moon rock

08:07.087 --> 08:10.956
brought back by the Apollo 16
mission in 1972,

08:10.958 --> 08:14.960
gaze on a replica of
the Hubble Telescope,

08:14.962 --> 08:18.029
and check out a model
of the Mars Rover

08:18.031 --> 08:21.299
that famously landed
on the Red Planet in 2004.

08:21.335 --> 08:25.570
But among these
out-of-this-world objects

08:25.705 --> 08:28.974
is one that tells
a very human story.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.677
The artifact is a golden
colored circular object.

08:32.746 --> 08:36.113
It is shiny with etchings
of geometric shapes.

08:36.149 --> 08:39.618
It was a part of
an important space mission.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.589
WILDMAN: This unique record
cover recalls

08:44.658 --> 08:48.260
the most important message
mankind has ever sent.

08:48.362 --> 08:51.862
This is the story
about space, aliens

08:51.899 --> 08:54.132
and a love that will last
for eternity.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.606
WILDMAN: It's spring 1977

09:01.675 --> 09:03.942
in Ithaca, New York.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.144
Twenty years after
the first satellite

09:06.213 --> 09:09.014
was launched into orbit,
NASA is about to embark

09:09.016 --> 09:11.416
on its most ambitious
mission yet --

09:11.418 --> 09:13.818
dispatching an unmanned probe

09:13.820 --> 09:16.488
to the farthest corners
of space.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.823
It's named Voyager.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.826
Their goal is to fly past
all of the outer planets

09:21.828 --> 09:24.496
and reveal these worlds that,
really, we'd never seen

09:24.598 --> 09:26.698
from close range before.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.302
WILDMAN: And of the countless
technicians, engineers,

09:31.305 --> 09:33.637
and rocket scientists working
on the mission,

09:33.674 --> 09:36.374
the one with perhaps
the strangest job of all

09:36.443 --> 09:39.243
is 27-year-old Ann Druyan.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.914
Her task is to create a message
from the human race

09:42.916 --> 09:45.517
to any form of
extraterrestrial life

09:45.652 --> 09:47.385
that might encounter
the craft.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.688
It will be called
the Golden Record.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.925
The basic idea
behind the Golden Record

09:54.060 --> 09:57.462
is that if an alien were
to intercept Voyager

09:57.531 --> 10:00.131
at some point,
then they could take it

10:00.200 --> 10:02.767
and learn something
about humanity.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.136
WILDMAN: The 12-inch,
gold-plated copper disk

10:05.172 --> 10:07.605
will hold around 90 minutes
of sound

10:07.674 --> 10:09.808
and about 100 images

10:09.910 --> 10:12.611
in the same way that
vinyl records hold music.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.013
The record's cover,
a replica of which

10:15.148 --> 10:17.615
now sits at the NASA Jet
Propulsion Laboratory

10:17.617 --> 10:19.817
in Pasadena, California,
will be engraved

10:19.853 --> 10:22.820
with instructions on how
the disk can be played.

10:22.889 --> 10:27.125
Druyan must have felt the weight
of the world on her shoulders
for this.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.228
I mean, that's an insane task
for anybody.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.101
WILDMAN: Over the course
of six months,

10:37.170 --> 10:40.371
Druyan records greetings
in more than 50 different
languages.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.841
MAN:<i> Hola y saludos a todos</i> .

10:42.943 --> 10:45.042
WOMAN:<i> Zdrávstvuyte!</i>
<i>Privétstvuyu Vas.</i>

10:45.078 --> 10:47.779
MAN:<i> Dharati ke waasiyon</i>
<i>ki or se namaskar</i> .

10:47.914 --> 10:50.248
CHILD: Hello from the children
of Planet Earth.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.017
WILDMAN: Then she selects
sounds and music

10:53.086 --> 10:54.986
from around the world.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.121
KRAMER: The music featured
on the Golden Record

10:57.190 --> 11:00.391
is truly a greatest hits
kind of mixed tape,

11:00.427 --> 11:04.528
from Bach to Beethoven
to Mozart to Louis Armstrong.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.165
WILDMAN: She even includes
personal messages

11:07.300 --> 11:10.267
from notable world leaders,
such as the Secretary General

11:10.303 --> 11:12.670
of the United Nations.

11:12.706 --> 11:16.907
Everything on the Golden Record
was very meticulously chosen.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.210
WILDMAN: But as the launch date
approaches,

11:19.345 --> 11:22.346
Druyan feels there's one key
aspect of humanity

11:22.416 --> 11:24.416
that's missing
from the Golden Record --

11:24.551 --> 11:26.651
the way people think.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.556
KRAMER: She wanted to come up
with some way that

11:31.625 --> 11:33.825
aliens might communicate
that we as humans

11:33.894 --> 11:36.094
can't really understand
right now,

11:36.096 --> 11:40.031
so Druyan gets this idea
to actually record

11:40.166 --> 11:42.366
her own brainwaves.

11:42.436 --> 11:45.703
WILDMAN:
Druyan plans to think about
key moments in world history

11:45.806 --> 11:48.038
while hooked up
to a machine called

11:48.075 --> 11:51.042
an electroencephalogram,
or EEG.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.248
KRAMER: Druyan wanted
to use the EEG

11:57.383 --> 12:00.852
as a way of basically recording
human history

12:00.987 --> 12:03.121
with her own thoughts.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.923
WILDMAN:
And while there's no way
of converting the EEG findings

12:05.959 --> 12:08.126
back into intelligible
information,

12:08.261 --> 12:11.395
Druyan hopes that aliens
might somehow have
the technology

12:11.431 --> 12:13.797
to decode the waves.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.000
On June 3, 1977,

12:16.069 --> 12:18.136
Druyan is hooked up
to the machine,

12:18.138 --> 12:20.138
but then something
extraordinary happens

12:20.240 --> 12:22.740
that threatens to put
the entire Golden Record project

12:22.809 --> 12:24.575
in jeopardy.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.644
This was not
what Druyan expected.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.201
It's 1977.

12:34.237 --> 12:36.671
NASA technicians are
preparing to send

12:36.740 --> 12:39.941
the Voyager spacecraft
on a journey beyond the stars.

12:40.076 --> 12:43.211
The ship will carry
strange cargo,

12:43.313 --> 12:45.880
a special disk known as
the Golden Record,

12:45.949 --> 12:49.150
upon which will be etched
a catalog of information

12:49.285 --> 12:51.286
relating to life on Earth.

12:51.421 --> 12:53.420
Its intended audience?
Aliens.

12:53.457 --> 12:56.424
Charged with compiling
the record is a young woman

12:56.426 --> 12:58.960
named Ann Druyan --
she's about to include

12:59.029 --> 13:01.496
an extraordinary secret.

13:01.498 --> 13:05.233
Once Druyan completes
the recording,

13:05.302 --> 13:08.436
the results are transferred
onto the Golden Record.

13:08.438 --> 13:12.239
On August 20, 1977,

13:12.275 --> 13:15.710
it is launched into space
aboard the Voyager spacecraft.

13:20.450 --> 13:23.584
But two days later, Druyan makes
a stunning confession.

13:23.620 --> 13:26.854
While undergoing the EEG,
she wasn't actually thinking

13:26.857 --> 13:30.191
about the greatest events
of our age at all...
far from it.

13:30.193 --> 13:32.193
There was only one thing
on her mind,

13:32.195 --> 13:34.429
and it had nothing to do
with world history.

13:34.531 --> 13:36.998
WILDMAN: One single person
occupied her thoughts --

13:37.067 --> 13:40.435
the project's director,
astrophysicist, Carl Sagan.

13:40.537 --> 13:44.005
She and Sagan are madly in love.

13:44.007 --> 13:47.074
All she could think about
was...

13:47.110 --> 13:49.744
the love of her life,
was Sagan.

13:49.879 --> 13:52.513
WILDMAN: Just days before
the EEG scan,

13:52.516 --> 13:56.017
she and Sagan had professed
their feelings for each other.

13:56.152 --> 13:59.287
KRAMER: They were talking,
and one thing led to the other

13:59.289 --> 14:01.755
and on the spot decided
to get married.

14:01.791 --> 14:04.091
WILDMAN: So instead of
recording important dates

14:04.160 --> 14:06.093
throughout history,
what gets captured

14:06.162 --> 14:08.896
is the euphoria of
a young person in love.

14:08.899 --> 14:11.566
So all of that,
all of those brainwaves,

14:11.568 --> 14:14.168
those loving feelings,
were being recorded.

14:18.641 --> 14:21.376
WILDMAN: For Druyan,
it ends up being poetic.

14:21.511 --> 14:24.612
One of humanity's greatest
abilities in many ways

14:24.648 --> 14:27.982
is to love, and having that
represented in such

14:28.051 --> 14:30.785
a prominent spot
on the Golden Record

14:30.787 --> 14:32.987
is more than appropriate.

14:33.056 --> 14:35.723
WILDMAN: Druyan and Sagan
marry in 1981

14:35.725 --> 14:38.058
and remain together
until Sagan's death

14:38.094 --> 14:40.094
in 1996.

14:41.565 --> 14:44.132
And because of a Golden Record,
their love lives on.

14:44.134 --> 14:47.134
Today, Voyager continues
its journey,

14:47.170 --> 14:50.204
traveling about 35,000 miles
per hour,

14:50.206 --> 14:53.341
approximately 12 billion miles
away from Earth

14:53.410 --> 14:56.010
in the far reaches of space.

14:56.012 --> 15:00.148
She was a person in love,
and that's now recorded

15:00.150 --> 15:02.683
for all time.

15:02.752 --> 15:05.419
WILDMAN: And this copy
of the Golden Record cover

15:05.455 --> 15:08.089
is on display at the NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory

15:08.224 --> 15:10.558
in Pasadena, California.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.794
It's a reminder of
star-crossed lovers

15:12.796 --> 15:14.762
whose story is etched
upon gold

15:14.798 --> 15:17.065
and hurtling through space.

15:20.170 --> 15:24.372
The state of Iowa is home
to almost 4,000 wind turbines.

15:24.507 --> 15:27.442
The power generated from
mighty machines like these

15:27.577 --> 15:30.911
is enough to provide energy
to 25 million homes

15:30.947 --> 15:33.081
across the nation.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.983
Many of these turbines
are built here,

15:35.085 --> 15:37.185
in the city of West Branch.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.987
And this Midwestern locale
is also the birthplace

15:39.990 --> 15:43.191
of the country's 31st president,
Herbert Hoover.

15:43.326 --> 15:45.460
His legacy is celebrated

15:45.595 --> 15:48.396
at the Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library
and Museum.

15:53.403 --> 15:56.604
Visitors can gaze upon
a selection of eclectic items

15:56.673 --> 15:59.473
given to Hoover and his staff.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.677
Among them, a bronze sculpture
of a rooster,

16:02.746 --> 16:04.879
sent by the people of France,

16:04.948 --> 16:07.614
a scroll in a presentation box

16:07.651 --> 16:10.118
from the Soviet Union,

16:10.253 --> 16:12.286
and a gold and silver inlaid jar

16:12.288 --> 16:14.755
donated by a Japanese admiral.

16:14.791 --> 16:17.759
But among these international
artifacts is one

16:17.894 --> 16:20.595
that hails from Hoover's
own backyard.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.433
SCHAEFER: The object is round
and covered in leather.

16:26.469 --> 16:30.271
It is entirely brown in color
and shows signs of wear.

16:30.340 --> 16:31.939
Scrawled across its surface

16:32.008 --> 16:33.908
are several signatures.

16:34.043 --> 16:37.111
WILDMAN: Some say this simple
orb once saved

16:37.213 --> 16:39.246
the president's life.

16:39.315 --> 16:41.849
SCHAEFER: This is a story
about a creative doctor,

16:41.851 --> 16:45.253
a stubborn president,
and a sport born
on the White House lawn.

16:48.658 --> 16:50.958
WILDMAN: It's November 6, 1928.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.261
Herbert Hoover is elected
the 31st president

16:53.396 --> 16:55.062
of the United States.

16:55.131 --> 16:57.331
He has grand plans
for his term.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.267
SCHAEFER: Hoover saw that
there was a farm crisis,

16:59.402 --> 17:01.335
there was a disrespect
for the law,

17:01.337 --> 17:03.704
and that civil service needed
to be reformed,

17:03.707 --> 17:05.940
and he was ready to get to work.

17:06.075 --> 17:08.042
WILDMAN: But in the weeks
and months that follow,

17:08.111 --> 17:10.278
the new president's team
of advisors

17:10.280 --> 17:12.680
becomes aware
of a challenging issue --

17:12.749 --> 17:15.616
the relentless schedule
of formal banquets

17:15.685 --> 17:17.952
and diplomatic dinners
leave Hoover

17:17.954 --> 17:20.421
with almost no time
for exercise.

17:20.523 --> 17:24.425
SCHAEFER: Between winning
the election in November 1928

17:24.494 --> 17:27.295
and Inauguration Day,
March 4, 1929,

17:27.430 --> 17:29.764
Hoover gained 25 pounds,

17:29.833 --> 17:31.966
which, for a man who started
at 175,

17:32.101 --> 17:34.401
is an alarming weight gain.

17:34.437 --> 17:36.771
WILDMAN: Most worried of all
is the White House physician,

17:36.906 --> 17:39.573
a man named Dr. Joel T. Boone.

17:39.642 --> 17:43.110
SCHAEFER:
Boone took his responsibility
as White House physician

17:43.113 --> 17:45.113
very, very seriously.

17:45.215 --> 17:47.181
Being the personal physician
to the president

17:47.217 --> 17:50.685
is the most vital role
a doctor can serve
in America.

17:50.787 --> 17:53.521
WILDMAN: Boone knows all
too well what the stress

17:53.523 --> 17:56.190
of being president can do
to the human body.

17:56.259 --> 17:58.325
He had been the assistant
White House physician

17:58.394 --> 18:00.795
for the previous two
commanders-in-chief.

18:00.930 --> 18:03.463
He saw Harding die in office,

18:03.500 --> 18:06.200
and he saw Coolidge get
very sick at the end
of his term,

18:06.269 --> 18:08.603
and he didn't want that
to happen on his watch.

18:08.605 --> 18:10.138
When he was White House
physician,

18:10.273 --> 18:13.007
he wanted his president
to be as healthy as possible.

18:13.109 --> 18:15.276
WILDMAN: Boone concludes
that if Hoover continues

18:15.411 --> 18:19.013
to combine gluttony with sloth,
the outcome could be fatal.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.549
He wasn't going to sugarcoat it
for the president.

18:21.618 --> 18:24.318
He said, "If you don't change
your ways, you're gonna die."

18:26.790 --> 18:28.689
WILDMAN: Boone suggests that
the commander-in-chief

18:28.825 --> 18:31.893
take up tennis or golf,
but the president refuses,

18:32.028 --> 18:35.829
asserting that his demanding
schedule doesn't allow
for such pursuits.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.300
Hoover wasn't going to give
three hours a day

18:39.369 --> 18:42.103
to exercise or even
an hour a day to exercise.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.573
WILDMAN: So Boone proposes
that the president takes

18:45.675 --> 18:48.876
early morning walks instead,
but the headstrong Hoover

18:48.912 --> 18:50.845
isn't interested.

18:50.914 --> 18:53.447
Boone was going to have
to get creative

18:53.449 --> 18:55.449
if he wanted to keep Hoover
healthy enough

18:55.518 --> 18:57.652
to lead the nation.

18:57.787 --> 18:59.786
WILDMAN: How will Dr. Boone
convince Hoover

18:59.823 --> 19:02.323
to get moving?

19:05.962 --> 19:09.129
It's 1929 in Washington, D.C.

19:09.199 --> 19:12.333
Dr. Joel Boone has the most
important job of any

19:12.402 --> 19:15.068
physician in the nation --
taking care of the president,

19:15.104 --> 19:17.705
Herbert Hoover,
but the commander-in-chief

19:17.707 --> 19:20.173
is out of shape and overweight.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.576
What's more,
he hates to exercise.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.379
So how will this determined
doctor get the president

19:25.415 --> 19:27.982
into fighting form?

19:28.084 --> 19:31.185
Boone decides that if he can't
convince the president

19:31.287 --> 19:34.121
to take up a traditional sport
like tennis or golf,

19:34.224 --> 19:36.757
then he'll invent
a completely new one.

19:36.826 --> 19:39.660
SCHAEFER: This game that Boone
designed drew on

19:39.762 --> 19:42.330
elements from volleyball,
from basketball,

19:42.465 --> 19:44.365
and from tennis.

19:44.467 --> 19:47.534
WILDMAN: From volleyball,
Boone takes the idea

19:47.570 --> 19:49.536
of a court with
an 8-foot-high net

19:49.572 --> 19:51.772
separating two teams
of competitors.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.575
From tennis, he borrows
the scoring system.

19:54.677 --> 19:56.978
but what makes the game
truly unique

19:57.080 --> 20:00.181
is the incorporation of
a six-pound medicine ball.

20:00.183 --> 20:02.884
Hoover agrees
to give it a try.

20:04.854 --> 20:06.921
On an early spring morning
in 1929,

20:07.023 --> 20:09.390
Boone invites Hoover
and a group of willing

20:09.492 --> 20:11.258
White House staffers
to meet him

20:11.327 --> 20:13.294
on the White House lawn,
where Boone has prepared

20:13.396 --> 20:16.063
an ad hoc court
and an 8-foot net.

20:16.065 --> 20:18.199
Boone explains the rules
of his new game

20:18.301 --> 20:20.067
to the assembled throng.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.737
The objective of the new game
was to throw the ball

20:22.739 --> 20:25.006
over the net into your
opponent's territory

20:25.008 --> 20:27.475
in such a way that they could
not catch it or return it.

20:27.610 --> 20:30.878
WILDMAN: It combines cardio
with high-intensity muscle use,

20:30.947 --> 20:33.347
reaping the same benefits
as other sports

20:33.416 --> 20:35.816
in a much shorter span
of time.

20:35.919 --> 20:39.286
Six-pound medicine ball was
extremely taxing

20:39.322 --> 20:41.822
to throw 30 feet at a go,

20:41.891 --> 20:44.358
and then to catch it
on the other end.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.261
So in 30 minutes, you would get
your full day's workout.

20:47.396 --> 20:50.497
WILDMAN: And before long,
Hoover is hooked.

20:50.533 --> 20:54.068
Hoover enjoyed this game
enormously because

20:54.203 --> 20:56.970
it was competitive,
it was demanding,

20:57.006 --> 21:00.207
it was hard work,
and he got a chance

21:00.276 --> 21:02.576
for just a little while
to be one of the guys.

21:02.712 --> 21:05.579
WILDMAN: The new game
is such a big hit

21:05.682 --> 21:08.082
that it's soon named
Hooverball,

21:08.184 --> 21:10.584
and the president and his
colleagues continue playing

21:10.653 --> 21:13.186
every morning, rain or shine.

21:13.222 --> 21:16.123
SCHAEFER:
The president dropped 25 pounds.

21:16.159 --> 21:19.860
Boone had hit upon
a genius solution.

21:19.929 --> 21:22.863
WILDMAN: And long after

21:22.966 --> 21:25.466
the Hoover administration
has passed into the annals

21:25.535 --> 21:27.702
of history,
the game lives on.

21:27.804 --> 21:30.471
SCHAEFER:
Hooverball is still played today

21:30.540 --> 21:34.141
in CrossFit gyms,
in junior high gyms,

21:34.143 --> 21:37.011
in high school gyms,
on army bases.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.547
WILDMAN: Today,

21:40.616 --> 21:43.150
this signed medicine ball,
used during the president's

21:43.285 --> 21:46.020
last game of Hooverball,
is on display

21:46.022 --> 21:48.155
at the Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library

21:48.290 --> 21:50.624
and Museum in West Branch, Iowa.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.561
It recalls an inventive doctor
who solved a weighty issue

21:54.630 --> 21:56.831
of presidential proportions.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.838
Every year,
more than 336,000 tons

22:03.973 --> 22:06.973
of Concord grapes are harvested
in the United States,

22:07.009 --> 22:10.777
providing the source for
America's best-selling jelly.

22:10.813 --> 22:14.114
This hardy variety of grape
gets its name

22:14.183 --> 22:17.218
from the town where it was first
developed in 1849 --

22:17.320 --> 22:19.653
Concord, Massachusetts.

22:19.789 --> 22:22.122
This juicy history
of the area and more

22:22.158 --> 22:24.492
is preserved
at the Concord Museum.

22:27.730 --> 22:29.597
Much of the institution
is dedicated

22:29.732 --> 22:31.865
to relics from
the American Revolution,

22:31.934 --> 22:34.802
including a musket and sword
used by a soldier

22:34.937 --> 22:37.471
in the British army,
a gunpowder horn

22:37.507 --> 22:40.006
that belonged to a member
of the Massachusetts militia,

22:40.042 --> 22:43.677
and the very lantern
that was hung up

22:43.713 --> 22:46.280
when Paul Revere famously
warned of the British approach

22:46.282 --> 22:48.416
in 1775.

22:50.853 --> 22:53.120
But one object in the collection
is revolutionary

22:53.122 --> 22:55.655
in a totally unique way.

22:55.691 --> 22:59.493
COSTELLO:
The artifact is about 9 inches
wide by about 6 inches high.

22:59.628 --> 23:03.630
It's an object
that's about 3 pounds
but hollow on the inside.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.765
Printed on the top

23:05.802 --> 23:08.635
are the words "Drawing Pencils,
Concord, Massachusetts."

23:08.704 --> 23:12.706
WILDMAN: These simple objects
tell an extraordinary tale

23:12.842 --> 23:16.076
of a great American penman
and his unique relationship

23:16.112 --> 23:17.978
with a pencil.

23:18.047 --> 23:20.180
This is a story about a man
who transformed writing,

23:20.216 --> 23:22.549
both on and off the page.

23:22.618 --> 23:27.321
♪♪

23:27.423 --> 23:30.123
WILDMAN: It's May 6, 1862.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.259
The literary world is
mourning the death

23:32.328 --> 23:35.196
of 44-year-old renowned writer
and philosopher,

23:35.198 --> 23:37.564
Henry David Thoreau.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.100
Thoreau is known for
his passionate essays

23:40.169 --> 23:42.602
and biting social commentary
that tackled

23:42.638 --> 23:44.805
a wide array of topics
from natural history

23:44.874 --> 23:47.074
to the abolitionist movement.

23:47.143 --> 23:49.076
He was one of
the most

23:49.145 --> 23:51.345
notable writers in the country.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.547
Thoreau was able to write
"Life Without Principle,"

23:53.649 --> 23:56.416
"Civil Disobedience,"
and "Slavery in Massachusetts."

23:56.486 --> 23:59.486
WILDMAN: But he is best known
for his seminal work --

23:59.555 --> 24:03.624
<i>Walden</i> , a voyage of
spiritual discovery

24:03.626 --> 24:06.293
which he wrote while living
in a tiny cabin in the woods

24:06.362 --> 24:09.230
on the shores of
Walden Pond, Massachusetts.

24:09.232 --> 24:11.765
In it, the writer espouses
a philosophy

24:11.834 --> 24:14.268
of living close
to the natural world,

24:14.337 --> 24:16.370
but few realize
that one of his greatest

24:16.372 --> 24:18.739
contributions to literature
came not from the pen

24:18.874 --> 24:20.841
but from the pencil.

24:22.512 --> 24:25.245
It's 1837 in Concord,
Massachusetts.

24:25.281 --> 24:27.514
After studying English
at Harvard,

24:27.517 --> 24:29.984
Henry David Thoreau has
returned to his boyhood home

24:30.119 --> 24:33.053
to work in his father's factory
making pencils.

24:33.189 --> 24:36.190
He felt that this plan
would probably end up

24:36.259 --> 24:38.559
being just a stepping stone
towards his future.

24:38.694 --> 24:41.461
WILDMAN: But when he takes up
his role, the young graduate

24:41.497 --> 24:43.597
notices that the pencils
being produced

24:43.666 --> 24:45.933
in his father's factory
are vastly inferior

24:46.035 --> 24:48.268
to the ones made
by Europeans.

24:48.337 --> 24:52.072
Not only is
the graphite brittle,

24:52.141 --> 24:55.676
but the process of making
the pencils is inefficient.

24:55.811 --> 24:58.546
COSTELLO:
For someone who is going
to be using them frequently,

24:58.681 --> 25:01.415
like writers or artists,
having such an inferior

25:01.417 --> 25:04.051
product was ludicrous.

25:04.120 --> 25:07.021
WILDMAN: So the young Thoreau
makes a bold decision.

25:07.123 --> 25:10.024
Thoreau would have to reinvent
the pencil industry.

25:15.798 --> 25:18.565
Today, Henry David Thoreau
is known as

25:18.601 --> 25:20.668
one of America's
greatest writers,

25:20.803 --> 25:22.703
but back in the 1830s,

25:22.805 --> 25:26.173
this man of letters had
a very different job,

25:26.175 --> 25:28.742
working in his father's
pencil factory.

25:28.811 --> 25:31.478
So how will Thoreau
make his mark

25:31.581 --> 25:34.048
with a pencil as well as a pen?

25:36.085 --> 25:38.818
Thoreau thinks he can build
a better pencil.

25:38.854 --> 25:41.622
He starts by examining
the problem of
the brittle graphite.

25:41.624 --> 25:45.025
He realized he needed to create
a more sturdy compound.

25:45.094 --> 25:48.695
Thoreau found that when
graphite was mixed with clay,

25:48.731 --> 25:51.065
it became considerably stronger.

25:51.167 --> 25:54.068
Under rigorous testing,
this graphite held up well.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.772
WILDMAN: Then he addresses
the issue of manufacturing.

25:58.841 --> 26:01.241
At this point, even though
we have a superior graphite,

26:01.277 --> 26:04.645
manufacturing pencils
is still a really
labor-intensive process.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.314
WILDMAN: The standard way
to make a pencil

26:07.316 --> 26:09.382
is to cut a length
of cedar in half

26:09.418 --> 26:12.653
and then drill a groove
down the middle of each side.

26:12.722 --> 26:15.522
The graphite is then inserted,
and the halves

26:15.658 --> 26:18.258
are glued together
like a sandwich.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.861
This process was both
incredibly time-consuming,

26:20.863 --> 26:23.864
and it used a tremendous
amount of resources.

26:26.402 --> 26:28.602
WILDMAN: To skip the steps
of cutting and gluing,

26:28.704 --> 26:31.071
Thoreau invents
a new kind of drill.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.674
Using this machine,
Thoreau was now able

26:33.809 --> 26:37.211
to drill a very fine hole
into very small cylinders
of wood.

26:37.213 --> 26:39.813
Then a cylinder of
his new graphite would

26:39.948 --> 26:42.282
snugly be installed
into the wood.

26:42.284 --> 26:44.685
WILDMAN: With his father's
blessing, the new system

26:44.754 --> 26:48.021
is implemented in the factory,
and it changes everything.

26:48.090 --> 26:51.291
This machine revolutionized
the pencil industry.

26:51.394 --> 26:54.027
Thoreau's father's
pencil business

26:54.030 --> 26:56.096
became the most successful
of its kind

26:56.231 --> 26:58.165
in the entire country.

26:58.167 --> 27:00.701
WILDMAN: Using profits from
his family's booming business,

27:00.770 --> 27:03.703
Thoreau happily retreats
to the life of writing

27:03.739 --> 27:06.707
that he's best known for today.

27:06.776 --> 27:10.444
This pencil and box from
Thoreau's father's company

27:10.446 --> 27:14.047
is on display at the Concord
Museum in Massachusetts.

27:14.050 --> 27:17.417
It serves as a token
of one 19th-century author

27:17.486 --> 27:19.853
who made his mark
with the pencil

27:19.922 --> 27:21.889
as well as the pen.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.793
Route 66.

27:25.928 --> 27:28.062
Running for more than
2,400 miles

27:28.164 --> 27:31.265
through eight different states,
this famous stretch of road

27:31.267 --> 27:34.400
is nicknamed
"America's Main Street."

27:34.437 --> 27:36.503
Along the route dotted
with diners, motels,

27:36.539 --> 27:39.339
and roadside attractions,
this historic highway

27:39.375 --> 27:42.142
passes through the center
of Albuquerque, New Mexico,

27:42.178 --> 27:44.945
and this city is home
to an institution

27:44.947 --> 27:46.847
dedicated to objects
that have traveled

27:46.949 --> 27:48.649
a much longer road --

27:48.751 --> 27:52.652
the Meteorite Museum.

27:52.722 --> 27:55.422
On display is an incredible
selection of space rocks,

27:55.491 --> 27:58.992
including a cluster that formed
around the same time

27:58.994 --> 28:00.961
as the sun,

28:01.063 --> 28:04.098
one made almost entirely
of iron that fell to Earth

28:04.233 --> 28:06.633
120 million years ago,

28:06.702 --> 28:09.536
and the remnants of one
that ripped through
the atmosphere

28:09.671 --> 28:12.472
in 1960,

28:12.541 --> 28:16.309
but there's one colorful piece
that truly stands out

28:16.345 --> 28:18.512
from the crowd.

28:18.647 --> 28:20.914
The item is translucent
with shiny crystals

28:20.983 --> 28:22.783
on the surface.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.551
It is made of iron and nickel

28:24.686 --> 28:26.587
and is over 4 billion years old.

28:29.658 --> 28:31.725
WILDMAN: This meteorite is
linked to an epic tale

28:31.794 --> 28:34.528
of discovery and a tantalizing
treasure hunt.

28:34.530 --> 28:37.064
This story is about
a million-dollar meteorite

28:37.166 --> 28:40.133
that was part of a controversy
that left people

28:40.202 --> 28:42.469
searching for answers.

28:46.976 --> 28:48.942
WILDMAN: Since the dawn of time,

28:48.978 --> 28:51.678
mankind has been fascinated
with the secrets of the skies.

28:51.714 --> 28:55.549
The earliest humans tracked time
using the sun and the moon.

28:55.651 --> 28:58.285
The Greeks and Romans gave
names to the myriad

28:58.287 --> 29:00.687
constellations that whirl
above us,

29:00.790 --> 29:03.423
and today, perhaps our finest
scientific achievement

29:03.459 --> 29:06.226
has been to land a probe
on a moving comet

29:06.361 --> 29:08.829
as it passed through
our solar system.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.864
But one of the greatest
mysteries of the cosmos

29:10.999 --> 29:13.100
can be found not
in the stars above

29:13.102 --> 29:16.103
but right here on Earth --
the bizarre tale

29:16.238 --> 29:18.839
of a missing meteorite
that has baffled scientists

29:18.908 --> 29:21.441
and historians for decades.

29:21.477 --> 29:23.977
It's 1859

29:24.013 --> 29:26.713
at the Boston Society of
Natural History.

29:26.782 --> 29:29.182
A standard shipment
of geological samples

29:29.218 --> 29:32.118
has just arrived from
a government survey in Oregon,

29:32.154 --> 29:35.589
but included is one item that
is particularly fascinating.

29:35.691 --> 29:39.259
It's a small piece of meteorite
known as a pallasite.

29:39.328 --> 29:41.461
AGEE: Pallasites are
iron nickel metal

29:41.497 --> 29:44.063
with olivine crystals
that are green.

29:44.099 --> 29:47.534
It's a mixture of
the core and the outer part

29:47.536 --> 29:49.636
of the asteroid.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.473
WILDMAN:
It's an exhilarating find.

29:53.542 --> 29:56.677
AGEE: There were only three
known pallasites at that time,

29:56.679 --> 29:59.145
so they were
extraordinarily rare.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.615
WILDMAN: The scientists reach
out to the geologist

30:01.750 --> 30:04.084
who found the sample,

30:04.153 --> 30:06.320
a medical doctor turned
geologist named

30:06.455 --> 30:08.821
Dr. John Evans.

30:08.858 --> 30:11.358
Evans claims that three years
earlier, he was working

30:11.427 --> 30:14.161
for the U.S. government
surveying the rugged terrain

30:14.263 --> 30:17.030
near Port Orford, Oregon,
when he stumbled upon

30:17.132 --> 30:20.233
a large,
rather unusual-looking rock.

30:20.302 --> 30:23.303
Dr. Evans was out doing
fieldwork,

30:23.372 --> 30:25.305
and he came upon
this strange object

30:25.374 --> 30:28.008
that was about four feet
by five feet in dimensions,

30:28.110 --> 30:30.377
and it looked completely
out of place.

30:30.479 --> 30:32.379
He was so fascinated
by this object

30:32.481 --> 30:34.714
that he took a sample
off of it.

30:34.783 --> 30:37.251
WILDMAN: Evans claims

30:37.386 --> 30:39.253
he broke off a small piece

30:39.388 --> 30:41.722
and included it with the other
geological specimens

30:41.724 --> 30:44.057
he sent for official
identification

30:44.093 --> 30:46.059
to the scientists
at the Boston Society

30:46.194 --> 30:48.629
of Natural History,
leaving as much as 10 tons

30:48.764 --> 30:51.598
of meteorite still
in the Oregon forest.

30:51.667 --> 30:54.401
At the time,
the value of the pallasite

30:54.470 --> 30:57.337
was about $100 a pound.

30:57.406 --> 30:59.606
This means that that object
was worth

30:59.608 --> 31:02.109
at least $2 million.

31:02.111 --> 31:04.811
WILDMAN: News of the find

31:04.847 --> 31:07.680
sparks uproar
in the scientific community.

31:07.716 --> 31:10.684
Congress even prepares
to send out an expedition

31:10.686 --> 31:14.421
led by Evans himself to retrieve
the precious space rock.

31:14.490 --> 31:16.423
It was a true treasure hunt

31:16.492 --> 31:18.759
for the scientific value,
but, of course,

31:18.861 --> 31:22.162
also the monetary value,
because it was such
a rare object.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.898
WILDMAN: Then something
shocking happens.

31:25.033 --> 31:27.834
Just as Dr. Evans is starting
to pull all of this together

31:27.970 --> 31:30.370
to get his second
expedition funded,

31:30.406 --> 31:32.406
he dies of pneumonia.

31:34.910 --> 31:36.843
WILDMAN: To make matters worse,

31:36.946 --> 31:39.379
Evans fails to leave precise
instructions as to

31:39.481 --> 31:42.782
the exact location of
this celestial stone.

31:42.851 --> 31:45.251
In the years that follow,
countless hopeful

31:45.321 --> 31:47.521
meteorite hunters comb
the Oregon woods

31:47.623 --> 31:49.790
in an attempt to find
what comes to be known

31:49.792 --> 31:52.692
as the Port Orford Pallasite.

31:52.761 --> 31:56.329
AGEE: The region was scoured
by explorers

31:56.365 --> 31:58.765
and treasure hunters
and geologists

31:58.834 --> 32:01.868
for over 100 years,
and no one found

32:01.904 --> 32:04.137
this elusive meteorite.

32:04.272 --> 32:06.406
WILDMAN: Then, in 1993,

32:06.508 --> 32:09.042
a theory comes out
that rattles the scientific

32:09.177 --> 32:11.078
world to its core.

32:11.213 --> 32:14.381
So what's the truth behind
the Port Orford Pallasite?

32:20.739 --> 32:23.073
It's the 1990s in Oregon.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.009
For nearly 140 years,
rumors have swirled

32:26.078 --> 32:29.146
of a gigantic 10-ton meteorite
that was supposedly

32:29.248 --> 32:32.616
discovered back in the mid-1800s
by a geologist

32:32.751 --> 32:34.751
named Dr. John Evans.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.287
This legendary space rock
even has a name --

32:37.289 --> 32:39.989
the Port Orford Pallasite.

32:40.025 --> 32:41.758
So what's the truth
behind the tales

32:41.760 --> 32:43.727
of this celestial stone?

32:46.932 --> 32:50.366
In 1993, a meteorite specialist
at the Smithsonian

32:50.402 --> 32:54.504
named Roy Clarke is studying
the infamous meteorite.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.709
He compares the chemical
composition of Evans' pallasite

32:58.844 --> 33:01.544
with those of three others
known to exist

33:01.580 --> 33:03.647
in the 1850s.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.049
He comes to a shocking
conclusion.

33:06.051 --> 33:08.818
The modern analyses revealed
something extraordinary.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.988
It was possible
that Dr. Evans' discovery

33:12.057 --> 33:14.291
was all a big hoax.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.428
WILDMAN: Clarke notes
that Evans' sample

33:18.430 --> 33:22.032
is a near perfect match
to another commonly
known meteorite.

33:22.034 --> 33:25.201
The specimen that was brought
back from Oregon

33:25.270 --> 33:28.205
supposedly broken off
or chipped off of

33:28.307 --> 33:31.140
this massive meteorite was
in fact a piece of

33:31.176 --> 33:34.344
a meteorite that had fallen
in Chile back earlier

33:34.413 --> 33:36.513
in the 19th century.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.482
WILDMAN: Small pieces of
this other Chilean meteorite

33:39.518 --> 33:42.719
were readily available
for purchase in the 1850s.

33:42.788 --> 33:45.488
Clarke theorizes that
Dr. Evans never found

33:45.524 --> 33:49.025
a 10-ton meteorite at all
but rather purchased parts

33:49.027 --> 33:51.461
of the Chilean meteorite
and then passed them off

33:51.530 --> 33:53.763
as a totally new find.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.033
Roy Clarke felt that
the Port Orford meteorite

33:57.069 --> 33:59.635
was a hoax.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.838
WILDMAN: And the reason why
Evans would stage

34:01.940 --> 34:04.908
this elaborate ruse --
money.

34:04.977 --> 34:08.311
It turns out that Dr. Evans
was also in debt.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.181
One of the motivations
for him perpetrating

34:11.316 --> 34:14.017
this hoax would be
to erase his debts.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.655
WILDMAN: It's thought that
Evans may have hoped

34:18.657 --> 34:21.191
to secure government funding
for a trip to retrieve

34:21.260 --> 34:23.693
the rest of the meteorite
and that he intended

34:23.796 --> 34:25.795
to abscond with the cash.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.064
Today, most people agree
that the whole saga

34:28.133 --> 34:30.400
was likely a hoax,
but there are some

34:30.502 --> 34:33.937
who insist the Port Orford
meteorite is still out there.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.940
There's still a possibility
that somewhere out there

34:36.942 --> 34:39.342
in Oregon is this
million-dollar meteorite.

34:39.344 --> 34:43.079
WILDMAN: And a pallasite
much like the one

34:43.148 --> 34:45.781
Evans claimed to have discovered
is on display

34:45.818 --> 34:48.551
at the Meteorite Museum
in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.555
It's a reminder of
a mysterious meteorite

34:51.690 --> 34:54.691
and the geologist who may have
made it all up.

34:57.362 --> 34:59.996
The city of Turin
in Northern Italy

34:59.998 --> 35:02.632
is home to a structure that was,
in the late 1800s,

35:02.701 --> 35:05.235
Europe's tallest brick building.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.703
Known as the Mole Antonelliana,

35:07.739 --> 35:11.374
it still towers more than
500 feet over the city.

35:11.376 --> 35:15.111
Less than a mile away
is an institution

35:15.180 --> 35:17.780
dedicated to
a very different culture --

35:17.850 --> 35:20.016
the Museum of Oriental Art.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.722
On display is a Japanese
statue of the Buddha

35:25.724 --> 35:27.957
from the 1600s,

35:28.026 --> 35:30.660
suits of samurai armor,

35:30.795 --> 35:34.864
and a 500-year-old
ceremonial Tibetan apron

35:34.933 --> 35:37.067
made of human bones.

35:39.972 --> 35:42.672
But the artifact
with the most intriguing legend

35:42.708 --> 35:45.275
could easily be overlooked.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.377
LEVINE: It's about
11 inches tall.

35:47.512 --> 35:50.613
It's made of terracotta,
and it's the image

35:50.616 --> 35:53.783
of a person wearing a veil.

35:57.122 --> 35:59.089
WILDMAN: This statue is
a reminder

35:59.224 --> 36:01.624
of the curious controversy
surrounding one of

36:01.660 --> 36:03.894
the world's most
famous explorers.

36:04.029 --> 36:07.563
LEVINE:
This object recalls the story
of an imprisoned traveler

36:07.599 --> 36:11.268
and his extraordinary tales.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.807
WILDMAN: For centuries,
explorers and historians alike

36:17.843 --> 36:19.909
have been fascinated
by the adventures

36:19.978 --> 36:22.845
of the iconic 13th-century
Italian traveler

36:22.915 --> 36:25.181
Marco Polo.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.651
The legendary pioneer
is said to have been

36:27.786 --> 36:30.653
one of the first Europeans
to visit China.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.856
LEVINE:
He traveled through Persia,

36:32.991 --> 36:35.191
across the Pamir Mountains,

36:35.260 --> 36:37.661
across the Gobi Dessert.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.796
WILDMAN: According to
the history books,

36:39.798 --> 36:42.198
he left his home town of Venice
at the age of 15

36:42.334 --> 36:44.567
to accompany his father
and uncle,

36:44.603 --> 36:46.469
who were traveling merchants.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.271
For three years,
he followed a network

36:48.373 --> 36:50.607
of ancient trade routes
before finally arriving

36:50.709 --> 36:53.609
at the capital city of Xanadu
in northeastern China,

36:53.645 --> 36:56.012
where he served in the court
of the great emperor,

36:56.147 --> 36:57.881
Kublai Khan.

36:58.016 --> 36:59.950
LEVINE: According to
Marco Polo's own story,

37:00.085 --> 37:02.285
he was offered the position
of Khan's emissary,

37:02.420 --> 37:05.755
which gave him unparalleled
access into the vast lands

37:05.824 --> 37:07.757
that Kublai Khan ruled.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.993
WILDMAN: From there,
he crisscrossed the empire,

37:10.128 --> 37:12.162
traveling to
its farthest reaches,

37:12.164 --> 37:13.996
from Burma to India.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.399
LEVINE: Polo talked of
accompanying a Persian princess

37:16.501 --> 37:18.634
from Xanadu back to Persia.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.671
He spoke of Kublai Khan's
amazing palaces,

37:21.806 --> 37:24.306
decorated with dragons
on the walls.

37:24.343 --> 37:27.611
WILDMAN: Upon his return home,
he was thrown in jail

37:27.746 --> 37:29.712
as a prisoner of war.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.981
There, he met a writer
who put to paper

37:31.984 --> 37:34.250
Polo's amazing tales.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.653
Eventually, the compilation
of stories was published

37:36.788 --> 37:39.922
and came to be known as
<i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i> .

37:39.992 --> 37:42.726
LEVINE: At this time,

37:42.828 --> 37:46.195
China was an impossibly
exotic place

37:46.264 --> 37:48.264
to the people of Europe.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.134
Because of its extraordinary
subject matter, this book

37:51.269 --> 37:53.536
did very, very well
very quickly.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.739
It was translated
into different languages.

37:55.841 --> 37:58.375
It became popular
all across the world.

37:58.510 --> 38:01.277
WILDMAN: The book turns Polo
into a celebrity.

38:01.346 --> 38:05.482
But as the legend of Marco Polo
spreads, a problem arises.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.884
People begin to doubt
the traveler's honesty.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.221
LEVINE: Was Marco Polo
actually telling the truth,

38:11.356 --> 38:14.257
or were these just fantastical
imaginations?

38:14.326 --> 38:16.959
The stories

38:16.995 --> 38:20.296
of the Persian princess,
the amazing palaces.

38:20.365 --> 38:23.332
They sounded like they were
just fairy tales.

38:23.402 --> 38:26.202
WILDMAN: Some point to the fact
that Polo's stories

38:26.238 --> 38:28.705
leave out many seemingly
obvious details

38:28.840 --> 38:30.773
of Chinese culture.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.742
LEVINE: He doesn't talk about
the use of chopsticks,

38:32.877 --> 38:34.644
he doesn't talk about
tea drinking.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.413
He doesn't talk about
the existence of
the Great Wall of China.

38:37.449 --> 38:40.282
WILDMAN: Skeptics also find it
suspicious that there are

38:40.318 --> 38:44.020
no mentions of Marco Polo
in contemporaneous
Chinese writings.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.389
You would have thought that
he would be so unusual

38:47.426 --> 38:50.660
to the Chinese people
that somebody would have

38:50.662 --> 38:52.328
remarked on his existence.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.130
WILDMAN: Eventually,
<i>The Travels of Marco Polo</i>

38:54.166 --> 38:58.068
earns the nickname Il Milione,
or "the million lies."

38:58.203 --> 39:00.803
For his own part,

39:00.872 --> 39:03.672
Polo insists his tales
were true.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.109
LEVINE: In fact, he said,
"What I published is

39:06.111 --> 39:08.611
barely half of
what I actually saw."

39:08.747 --> 39:12.214
WILDMAN: So what's the truth
behind<i> The Tales of Marco Polo</i> ?

39:12.250 --> 39:14.250
Was it fact,
or was it fiction?

39:18.757 --> 39:20.823
For centuries,
the Italian traveler,

39:20.892 --> 39:23.692
Marco Polo, has been regarded
as one of the greatest

39:23.729 --> 39:26.062
explorers in human history.

39:26.164 --> 39:28.764
But some believe that many
of his tales of adventurous

39:28.834 --> 39:31.834
voyages are completely made up.

39:31.837 --> 39:35.238
So what's the true story
of Marco Polo?

39:35.240 --> 39:39.542
For centuries, the debate rages.

39:39.544 --> 39:42.679
Then, in 2012 in Germany,

39:42.814 --> 39:46.082
a professor of Chinese history
named Hans Ulrich Vogel

39:46.151 --> 39:49.018
decides to settle the matter
once and for all.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.921
Hans Ulrich Vogel is
an expert in Chinese history.

39:51.957 --> 39:55.224
He's somebody who's done a lot
of research into Marco Polo.

39:55.293 --> 39:59.095
WILDMAN:
He scrutinizes every detail
in<i> The Travels of Marco Polo</i> .

39:59.097 --> 40:02.365
He pinpoints information
that he believes offers

40:02.500 --> 40:04.100
a crucial piece of evidence.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.739
On his travels,
Polo claims to have witnessed

40:09.808 --> 40:13.342
a unique feature of
Chinese culture, paper money.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.213
LEVINE:
Vogel suggested that because
Marco Polo had described

40:17.215 --> 40:19.983
the existence of paper money
in China,

40:19.985 --> 40:23.319
he almost certainly had
been to China.

40:23.454 --> 40:25.688
WILDMAN: Paper money had been
in use in China

40:25.823 --> 40:28.024
since the 10th century
but didn't appear

40:28.026 --> 40:31.293
in Western cultures
for another 500 years.

40:31.329 --> 40:34.163
This, suggested Vogel,
was proof

40:34.232 --> 40:37.867
that Marco Polo really had
been to China.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.537
WILDMAN: As to the other
inconsistencies in the stories,

40:41.606 --> 40:44.440
the reason why Polo failed
to mention the Great Wall

40:44.442 --> 40:47.243
is because, to a large extent,
it was not constructed

40:47.312 --> 40:50.046
until a century after
Polo's visit.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.448
As for tea drinking
and chopsticks,

40:52.517 --> 40:55.185
they simply may not have fit
into the chosen stories

40:55.320 --> 40:58.121
put to print --
lastly, it's uncertain

40:58.256 --> 41:00.957
what name Polo would have
gone by in the Chinese court,

41:00.959 --> 41:04.327
so his absence from any
ancient Chinese texts

41:04.329 --> 41:06.729
cannot be taken as proof
he was not there.

41:06.864 --> 41:10.532
Despite this,
the truth may never be known.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.403
The fact is that

41:13.405 --> 41:15.538
the debate is still alive.

41:15.540 --> 41:18.341
Here's a story of a man who
means a lot to a lot of people,

41:18.410 --> 41:20.844
one of the most famous
travelers the world has
ever known,

41:20.946 --> 41:23.680
and yet we will probably
never know the truth.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.948
WILDMAN: Today,

41:26.017 --> 41:28.017
this Chinese statue
of a foreigner

41:28.152 --> 41:30.853
remains on display
at the Museum of
Oriental Art

41:30.956 --> 41:33.055
in Turin, Italy.

41:33.057 --> 41:36.158
It recalls a questionable legend
that traveled the globe

41:36.194 --> 41:38.394
and endured for centuries.

41:43.268 --> 41:45.635
From a presidential pastime

41:45.737 --> 41:48.738
to a much-improved pencil.

41:48.807 --> 41:51.240
A dinosaur discovery

41:51.309 --> 41:53.776
to an interstellar message.

41:53.812 --> 41:56.445
I'm Don Wildman, and these

41:56.514 --> 41:58.581
are the mysteries at the museum.
