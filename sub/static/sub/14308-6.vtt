WEBVTT

00:09.167 --> 00:10.733
- YAY.

00:10.767 --> 00:13.167
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA
ASK YOU ON A DATE.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.733
OH, SWEETIE.

00:14.767 --> 00:16.333
THERE'LL BE OTHER BOYS.

00:16.367 --> 00:18.300
CRY IT OUT.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.800
- DID THE PILLOW
AND THE COUCH BREAK UP?

00:19.833 --> 00:22.400
I THOUGHT THOSE TWO
WERE GONNA MAKE IT.

00:22.433 --> 00:24.767
- TAYLOR'S HOPING
A NEW BOY AT SCHOOL

00:24.800 --> 00:26.633
IS GOING TO ASK HER OUT,
AND I WANNA MAKE SURE

00:26.667 --> 00:28.667
I'M READY
WITH THE PERFECT RESPONSE.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.867
- TEEN GIRL DRAMA.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.667
FUN...

00:33.700 --> 00:35.633
I'LL BE OVER HERE
WATCHING THE PLAYOFFS.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.133
[snaps fingers,
TV turns on]

00:37.167 --> 00:38.800
- HEY.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.400
- YAY!

00:41.433 --> 00:43.233
AWW.

00:43.267 --> 00:45.867
YAY--AWW.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.167
- AND THAT'S
AFTER PRACTICING.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.500
- SO I'M IN THE LUNCH ROOM,

00:49.533 --> 00:51.400
AND WARREN SITS
AT THE VERY NEXT TABLE.

00:51.433 --> 00:52.800
- OOH, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

00:52.833 --> 00:55.167
- SO I START TALKING LOUDLY
WITH MY FRIENDS

00:55.200 --> 00:56.333
ABOUT THE NEW MOVIE
THAT I WANNA SEE.

00:56.367 --> 00:58.767
- DROPPING THE MOVIE HINT.
LOVE IT.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.267
- BUT THEN AFTER A FEW MINUTES,
HE JUST LEFT

01:00.300 --> 01:02.333
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING--
NOTHING.

01:02.367 --> 01:04.867
- YES! IN YOUR FACE!

01:04.900 --> 01:07.533
WHOO!

01:07.567 --> 01:09.567
UH, MY TEAM JUST SCORED.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.500
I'M GONNA GO WATCH THIS
AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.833
- I WISH I KNEW
IF WARREN LIKED ME.

01:16.867 --> 01:19.733
- AW, YOU SAID HE'S ONLY
BEEN AT SCHOOL FOR A FEW WEEKS.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.200
GIVE IT TIME.

01:21.233 --> 01:22.667
OOH.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.333
AH, AND, UH,
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING,

01:25.367 --> 01:27.400
HOW ABOUT BABYSITTING
LOUIE AND FRANKIE

01:27.433 --> 01:28.833
WHILE I RUN OUT
AND MEET THIS CATERING CLIENT?

01:28.867 --> 01:31.533
- MOM, I CAN'T DEAL
WITH CHILDREN RIGHT NOW.

01:31.567 --> 01:34.600
I'M MID-SOCIAL CRISIS.

01:34.633 --> 01:37.133
- BUT I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO WATCH THEM FOR A FEW HOURS.

01:37.167 --> 01:39.567
- DID SOMEBODY CALL FOR
A RESPONSIBLE BABYSITTER

01:39.600 --> 01:40.833
WHO'S CERTIFIED IN CPR

01:40.867 --> 01:42.633
AND IS VERY STRICT
ABOUT THE SWEETS?

01:42.667 --> 01:45.200
- THAT'S OKAY, MILES.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.700
- NO, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.733
YOU SEE THE BOWTIE
AND YOU SAY TO YOURSELF,

01:48.767 --> 01:50.833
"THIS KID'S A REBEL."

01:50.867 --> 01:54.467
WELL, LET ME ASSURE YOU,
I CAN LAY DOWN THE LAW.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.767
- IT'S JUST LOUIE
AND FRANKIE CAN BE TOUGH.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.467
- YOU KNOW
WHO ELSE CAN BE TOUGH?

01:58.500 --> 02:00.267
ME.
- EN GARDE!

02:02.933 --> 02:06.433
- BOW DOWN OR SUFFER
THE WRATH OF MY MUFFIN MACE.

02:06.467 --> 02:10.400
- YOUR WEAPON CAN'T PENETRATE
THIS HELMET OF SOURDOUGH.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.533
- MICHELLE, I CAN DO THIS.

02:15.567 --> 02:18.733
- OKAY, LISTEN UP.

02:18.767 --> 02:20.367
MILES IS GONNA WATCH YOU TWO

02:20.400 --> 02:22.100
WHILE I RUN OUT
TO MEET A CLIENT.

02:22.133 --> 02:26.133
I EXPECT YOU TO BEHAVE
LIKE YOU WOULD IF I WERE HERE.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.467
GOOD LUCK.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.667
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:38.700 --> 02:41.400
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:41.433 --> 02:43.667
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:43.700 --> 02:47.333
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:47.367 --> 02:49.500
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:49.533 --> 02:51.300
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:51.333 --> 02:53.867
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:53.900 --> 02:56.800
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:56.833 --> 02:58.767
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:58.800 --> 03:01.900
*

03:01.933 --> 03:04.600
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:04.633 --> 03:06.633
*

03:09.567 --> 03:11.167
- BABYSITTER'S HERE.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.600
SO WHO'S UP
FOR A LITTLE ARTS AND CRAFTS?

03:13.633 --> 03:15.767
WHOA.
- BOOM!

03:15.800 --> 03:17.433
I GOT ALL OF THAT ONE!

03:17.467 --> 03:19.767
I WARNED YOU NOT TO THROW
THAT KNUCKLE MUFFIN.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.100
HOO-HOO!

03:21.133 --> 03:22.467
- LOOK AT THIS MESS!

03:22.500 --> 03:24.267
I'VE ONLY BEEN GONE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS!

03:26.333 --> 03:27.433
- LET'S GO.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.333
BATTER UP!
GET IT?

03:29.367 --> 03:31.467
'CAUSE A MUFFIN
IS MADE FROM BATTER.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.367
- YOU MIGHT WANNA
STAND BACK, MILES.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.333
I'M BRINGING THE HEAT.

03:36.367 --> 03:38.767
- NOT ON MY WATCH.

03:40.300 --> 03:44.700
- HEY, I WAS ABOUT
TO HIT A HOME BUN!

03:44.733 --> 03:47.433
GET IT? BUN IS ALSO
PART OF THE BREAD FAMILY.

03:47.467 --> 03:51.633
- NICE.
YOU'RE ON A ROLL.

03:51.667 --> 03:54.433
- I DON'T GET IT.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.067
- GUYS, I'M IN CHARGE,

03:56.100 --> 03:58.067
AND YOU'RE GOING TO RESPECT
MY AUTHORITY.

03:58.067 --> 04:00.100
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU MAKE US.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.833
ALL RIGHT.

04:01.867 --> 04:05.500
HERE'S YOUR NEW BAT.

04:05.533 --> 04:08.500
OH, AND, UH,
HERE'S YOUR NEW GLOVE.

04:08.533 --> 04:11.167
TIME TO PITCH IN.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.500
HA! GET IT?

04:12.533 --> 04:16.167
'CAUSE YOU'RE CLEANING.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.467
THIS IS MESSED UP.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.600
DON'T YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DO SOMETHING?

04:21.633 --> 04:23.200
- OF COURSE I DO.

04:23.233 --> 04:26.233
I JUST REALLY ENJOY MOPPING.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.333
- TAYLOR!

04:32.367 --> 04:35.067
I RAN ALL THE WAY
FROM SCHOOL.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.600
WARREN'S ON HIS WAY
OVER HERE.

04:36.633 --> 04:38.200
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST TEXT US?

04:40.067 --> 04:43.167
OH.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.533
- THERE HE IS.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.167
DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.467
OH, HE'S SO CUTE.
LOOK AT HIM.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.733
I SAID DON'T LOOK!

04:50.767 --> 04:52.700
- YOU NEED TO FIND OUT
HOW HE FEELS.

04:52.733 --> 04:54.233
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:54.267 --> 04:57.367
NO MORE GAMES.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.133
OOPSIE.

04:59.167 --> 05:00.800
- OW!

05:00.833 --> 05:02.367
- OH, MY GOSH.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.467
I AM SO SORRY.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.533
THANKS.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.167
IT'S WARREN, ISN'T IT?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.567
- YEAH,
AND YOU'RE TAYLOR, RIGHT?

05:09.833 --> 05:11.467
- EH, IT COULD BE BETTER.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.200
- THAT'S AWESOME!

05:13.233 --> 05:14.800
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG?

05:14.833 --> 05:16.167
- I WAS SORTA
WANTING TO GO

05:16.200 --> 05:17.433
TO THE FLEUR-DE-LIS DANCE
TONIGHT,

05:17.467 --> 05:18.500
BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANYONE TO GO WITH.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.200
- OKAY, SO WEIRD,

05:20.233 --> 05:21.433
BUT I LOVE DANCES.

05:21.467 --> 05:23.500
I WAS JUST
TELLING MY FRIENDS,

05:23.533 --> 05:25.700
IF YOU'RE NOT FLEURING,
YOU'RE NOT LIVING.

05:25.733 --> 05:28.733
DIRECT QUOTE.

05:28.767 --> 05:30.533
- WOW, THAT'S GREAT.
SO YOU'RE A DANCER?

05:30.567 --> 05:32.367
- OH, I GOT THE MOVES.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.333
- LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S PRETTY LAST MINUTE,

05:34.367 --> 05:35.800
BUT MAYBE WE
SHOULD GO TOGETHER.

05:35.833 --> 05:39.667
- WARREN, THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED,
BUT OKAY.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.633
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

05:41.667 --> 05:44.333
HEY, DO YOU MIND IF I COME BY
THIS AFTERNOON AND WE PRACTICE?

05:44.367 --> 05:45.733
I DON'T WANNA LOOK
TOO STUPID OUT THERE.

05:45.767 --> 05:47.533
- OF COURSE.
LET'S SAY 3:00.

05:47.567 --> 05:48.767
I LIVE RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

05:48.800 --> 05:52.067
- ALL RIGHT,
SEE YOU THEN.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.600
- WARREN ASKED ME OUT!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.267
I GOT BACK AS FAST AS I COULD.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.700
OH, MY GOSH,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

06:09.733 --> 06:11.800
IT'S CLEAN.

06:11.833 --> 06:13.367
- WE'VE BEEN
HAVING A GREAT TIME.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.700
AFTER STRAIGHTENING UP,
WE TREATED OURSELVES

06:15.733 --> 06:18.267
WITH A LITTLE SUPERVISED FUN.
- OH.

06:18.300 --> 06:22.300
- LOUIE, DO YOU
HAVE SOMETHING FOR MICHELLE?

06:25.700 --> 06:27.600
- HELLO, MICHELLE.

06:27.633 --> 06:31.833
I MADE THIS LOVELY FIGURINE
OUT OF PINECONES.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.067
- I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.833
- THEY'VE BEEN BUSY BEAVERS.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.367
FRANKIE.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.333
- I MADE A SIGN
OUT OF TONGUE DEPRESSORS.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.667
- I MADE ONE TOO.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.400
- WOW, MILES.

06:48.433 --> 06:51.500
I HAVE TO SAY,
NEXT TIME I NEED A BABYSITTER,

06:51.533 --> 06:52.733
I WON'T HESITATE.

06:52.767 --> 06:55.433
- THERE'S GONNA BE
A NEXT TIME?

06:55.467 --> 06:57.400
- I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.467
NICE JOB.

06:59.533 --> 07:03.467
MY PLEASURE.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.200
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE VERY LOW
ON TONGUE DEPRESSORS.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.467
- MILES IS GOING TO PAY.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.433
IT'S TIME I GIVE MY BROTHER

07:11.467 --> 07:14.267
A LITTLE TASTE
OF WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.300
GHOST PIE.

07:23.700 --> 07:28.500
BUT BEFORE I TEACH HIM A LESSON,
I WILL EAT THIS LOVELY TREAT.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.667
- MY BUDDY'S CABLE WENT OUT.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.067
ALL I WANNA DO IS WATCH

07:38.100 --> 07:40.433
THE LAST COUPLE
OF INNINGS IN PEACE.

07:40.467 --> 07:42.200
- MOM, GUESS WHAT.

07:42.233 --> 07:44.067
WARREN'S TAKING ME
TO SOME FORMAL DANCE TONIGHT.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.200
- DOES THE TERM "PLAYOFF" MEAN
ANYTHING TO PEOPLE AROUND HERE?

07:51.233 --> 07:52.667
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.100
NOW, I KNOW YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN TO A FORMAL,

07:55.133 --> 07:58.667
SO IF YOU WANT YOUR MOM
TO TEACH YOU A FEW MOVES...

07:58.700 --> 08:01.300
OKAY, OKAY...

08:05.233 --> 08:08.233
JUST LET ME KNOW.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.233
- SO MY FRIEND'S
COMING OVER TO REHEARSE.

08:15.267 --> 08:16.633
- WELL, HE CAN'T SEE ME,

08:16.667 --> 08:19.133
SO JUST PRETEND
LIKE I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

08:19.167 --> 08:20.467
- GREAT.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.267
MUTE.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.633
- NOT WHAT I MEANT.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.133
- HEY, TAYLOR.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.567
- WARREN, HI.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.300
COME ON IN.
- THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.533
AT THE LAST ONE
OF THESE THINGS,

08:34.567 --> 08:36.133
I COMPLETELY
EMBARRASSED MYSELF.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.067
I'M SO LUCKY I FOUND
SUCH A TALENTED PARTNER

08:38.100 --> 08:39.067
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.733
- THAT YOU DID, WARREN.

08:40.767 --> 08:44.233
THAT YOU DID.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.600
SO HOW ABOUT WE BEGIN
WITH SOMETHING BASIC?

08:46.633 --> 08:48.667
- WORKS FOR ME.

08:54.733 --> 08:58.767
- OKAY,
WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.633
- SO WHAT ABOUT WE START OFF
WITH YOUR STANDARD QUICK STEP,

09:01.667 --> 09:03.333
CROSS OVER TO A FOXTROT,

09:03.367 --> 09:06.333
THEN SEGUE
INTO A LOUISIANA MAMBO?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.333
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:11.367 --> 09:12.767
IF WE WANT A SHOT
AT THE TITLE,

09:12.800 --> 09:16.400
WE GOTTA GET CREATIVE.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.633
- THE AMERICAN JUNIOR SOUTHEAST
BALLROOM CHAMPIONSHIPS.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.200
THE A.J.S.B.C.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.233
SO...

09:27.267 --> 09:29.767
WHAT ABOUT YOUR STANDARD
QUICK, QUICK, TURN,

09:29.800 --> 09:33.800
TOUCH, STEP, SPIN, FLEX,
SLIDE INTO A FAN KICK?

09:35.333 --> 09:37.500
- FAN KICK, TOTALLY.

09:37.533 --> 09:41.533
- FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.533
- THIS IS BETTER
THAN THE PLAYOFFS.

09:52.567 --> 09:55.067
- NO.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.567
I MEAN, I THINK I SEE
WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR.

09:58.600 --> 10:03.800
IN MY BALLROOM DANCING CAREER,
I FIND IT BEST TO KEEP IT FRESH.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.300
- I GUESS.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.367
I MEAN IT IS
ONLY THE LOUISIANA MAMBO.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.533
SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE DOING
ANYTHING TOO COMPLICATED.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.700
- EXACTLY.

10:13.733 --> 10:16.800
- ALL RIGHT.
COOL.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.167
SEE YOU THERE.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.333
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

10:21.367 --> 10:24.367
TAKE CARE NOW.

10:31.233 --> 10:34.233
- YIKES.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.533
- WE HAVE TO BE READY
FOR MILES' NEXT BABYSITTING

10:40.567 --> 10:43.100
BECAUSE I AM DONE
WITH ARTS AND CRAFTS.

10:43.133 --> 10:45.200
- ME TOO,
EXCEPT DID YOU KIND OF LIKE

10:45.233 --> 10:47.767
WEAVING THE PINECONE BASKETS?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.800
BECAUSE I SURE DIDN'T.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.267
- WAIT.
HERE'S SOMETHING.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.100
ACCORDING
TO YOUR GHOST TEXTBOOK,

10:57.133 --> 10:58.633
UNDER PROPER CONDITIONS,

10:58.667 --> 11:00.833
A GHOST CAN BLOW WIND
AT ANOTHER GHOST,

11:00.867 --> 11:04.133
TURNING HIM INTO VAPOR
AND RENDERING HIM POWERLESS.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.467
- YES.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.467
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO READ THIS FOR SCHOOL?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.200
- I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR.

11:13.233 --> 11:16.233
- IT'S ON PAGE THREE!

11:19.633 --> 11:21.600
- GREAT NEWS, KIDDOS.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.133
MICHELLE BRUISED HER ANKLE
AND HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

11:24.167 --> 11:27.267
SO I'M BACK IN CHARGE.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.200
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

11:30.233 --> 11:32.833
IT'S SNOWFLAKE TIME!

11:34.833 --> 11:36.567
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.767
WE CAN'T DO THIS.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.700
- THANK YOU.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.267
- WITHOUT SAFETY SCISSORS!

11:40.300 --> 11:43.200
I'LL BE BACK IN A JIFFY.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.567
GHOST WIND, HUH?

11:48.600 --> 11:52.100
IT'S TIME TO TAKE DOWN
MR. FARTS AND CRAFTS.

11:52.133 --> 11:55.600
AND AFTER THAT,
WE CAN PINECONE WEAVE.

11:55.633 --> 11:58.633
I'M TOTALLY KIDDING.

12:04.633 --> 12:06.533
- MILES IS COMING.
YOU READY?

12:06.567 --> 12:09.267
- ONCE I RENDER HIM POWERLESS
WITH MY ALMIGHTY GHOST WIND

12:09.300 --> 12:12.667
WE'LL TRAP HIM
IN THIS MILK BOTTLE.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.200
- ALL RIGHT.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.633
HOW ARE
MY LITTLE SNOW ANGELS DOING?

12:16.667 --> 12:20.400
- BEFORE WE BEGIN, LOUIE
HAS A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.

12:20.433 --> 12:24.067
- OH.

12:24.100 --> 12:27.500
- THAT WAS YOUR CUE,
CAPTAIN.

12:27.533 --> 12:30.600
- OH, RIGHT.

12:30.633 --> 12:34.633
- W-WHOA!

12:36.367 --> 12:38.700
- YOU DID IT.

12:38.733 --> 12:40.267
I'M STUNNED.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.100
- ME TOO.

12:42.133 --> 12:46.400
I MEAN, I KNEW I COULD.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.833
LOUIE, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

12:48.867 --> 12:52.633
- THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT UP HERE LOOKING IN.

12:55.467 --> 12:58.467
both: SEE YA!

13:02.300 --> 13:03.900
HOW DOES HE NOT KNOW
SOMETHING AS BASIC

13:03.933 --> 13:05.833
AS YOU CAN'T TRAP A GHOST
IN A BOTTLE?

13:05.867 --> 13:10.233
IT'S ON PAGE FOUR
OF HIS TEXTBOOK.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.633
- I HAD TO TELL WARREN
I WAS A GREAT DANCER.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.367
MY LIFE IS RUINED.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.833
- MICHELLE!

13:16.867 --> 13:19.767
- I THOUGHT HE WAS TAKING ME
TO A NORMAL DANCE,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.133
NOT SOME COMPETITION.

13:22.167 --> 13:24.167
- OH, THE FLEUR-DE-LIS.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.533
IT'S NOT JUST ANY COMPETITION.

13:25.567 --> 13:27.067
IT'S MAJOR.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.200
MAJOR.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.833
- GUESS YOU GOTTA BACK OUT.

13:32.867 --> 13:35.600
- I CAN'T BACK OUT.
WARREN WOULD HATE ME.

13:37.433 --> 13:39.700
- SO YOU WANT ME
TO HORRIFY WARREN

13:39.733 --> 13:42.233
AND HUMILIATE MYSELF
IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE?

13:42.267 --> 13:43.467
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

13:43.500 --> 13:46.500
- MICHELLE!

13:50.233 --> 13:51.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:51.433 --> 13:53.400
[snaps fingers,
TV turns off]

13:53.433 --> 13:55.767
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.633
HOW?

13:57.667 --> 14:00.800
- I CAN TEACH YOU
THE LOUISIANA MAMBO.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.867
- YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME,
RIGHT?

14:08.267 --> 14:09.800
*

14:11.233 --> 14:12.633
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:12.667 --> 14:14.633
I SPED IT UP
'CAUSE YOU'RE IN A HURRY.

14:14.667 --> 14:17.067
- RAY,
WHERE'D YOU LEARN ALL THAT?

14:17.100 --> 14:18.533
- I'M A MUSICIAN.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.167
YOU PLAY ENOUGH CLUBS,
YOU PICK STUFF UP.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.300
- YOU REALLY THINK I CAN LEARN

14:23.333 --> 14:25.500
THE LOUISIANA MAMBO
IN THREE HOURS?

14:25.533 --> 14:27.200
- I THINK SO.

14:27.233 --> 14:31.433
BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE FOCUS,
HARD WORK, AND...

14:33.400 --> 14:34.567
A BROOM.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.500
MEET YOUR
NEW PRACTICE PARTNER.

14:36.533 --> 14:37.800
BE CAREFUL.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.067
DON'T LET HIM
SWEEP YOU OFF YOUR FEET.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.300
- MICHELLE!

14:47.500 --> 14:49.500
- I'M HOME.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.333
- WOW.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.300
YOU REALLY
HURT YOUR ANKLE DANCING.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.167
ACTUALLY THAT WAS JUST A BRUISE.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.567
I DID THIS
SHOWING THE DOCTOR

14:59.600 --> 15:01.600
HOW I INJURED IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.433
ANYWAY,
HOW WAS THE BABYSITTING?

15:04.467 --> 15:06.133
- I THOUGHT
THEY WERE COMING AROUND,

15:06.167 --> 15:07.700
BUT THOSE TWO
ARE HAVING A HARD TIME

15:07.733 --> 15:09.400
ACCEPTING ME
AS AN AUTHORITY FIGURE.

15:09.433 --> 15:12.367
- HMM,
WELCOME TO MY LITTLE WORLD.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.767
- I COULD USE YOUR HELP.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.633
I HAVE AN IDEA
THAT WILL TEACH THEM A LESSON.

15:15.667 --> 15:16.833
- NOW WAIT.

15:16.867 --> 15:18.600
DOES IT INVOLVE
USING YOUR GHOST POWERS

15:18.633 --> 15:20.567
TO SCARE THE DAYLIGHTS OUT
OF THOSE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN?

15:20.600 --> 15:21.567
- YES, IT DOES.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.600
- YAY!
I'M SO IN.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.200
- IT'S IN THE UPPER DECK!

15:29.233 --> 15:31.167
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LOUIE PRESTON

15:31.200 --> 15:34.567
HAS MADE BAKERY BALL
HISTORY!

15:34.600 --> 15:39.300
A YOUNG BOY WITH NOTHING
BUT A DREAM AND A LOAF OF BREAD.

15:40.533 --> 15:43.100
- HEY, KIDS.

15:43.133 --> 15:44.233
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:47.333 --> 15:50.367
- MY ANKLE'S FINE.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.800
ANYWAY, WHEN I GOT BACK,

15:52.833 --> 15:55.633
IT WAS SO QUIET
I DECIDED TO REWARD YOU KIDS

15:55.667 --> 15:57.500
WITH SOME HOMEMADE BROWNIES.

15:57.533 --> 15:59.200
- BROWNIES!

15:59.233 --> 16:01.633
- ONLY THE BEST FOR SUCH
WELL-BEHAVED CHILDREN.

16:01.667 --> 16:04.767
WHERE IS MY FAVORITE BABYSITTER,
MILES, ANYWAY?

16:04.800 --> 16:07.500
- I'M SURE HE'S SOMEWHERE.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.800
WOW, HOW'D YOU
GET THESE SO GOOEY?

16:10.833 --> 16:12.767
- GREAT QUESTION, FRANKIE.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.100
I USED TWICE AS MUCH MILK
AS I USUALLY DO.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.467
IN FACT...

16:17.500 --> 16:20.500
I USED THE WHOLE BOTTLE.

16:26.500 --> 16:31.167
- MILK, FROM THAT BOTTLE.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.167
- OH, MAN!
OH, MAN!

16:33.200 --> 16:34.667
WE TRAPPED MILES
IN THAT BOTTLE.

16:34.700 --> 16:38.433
AND NOW HE'S
IN THOSE BROWNIES.

16:38.467 --> 16:41.200
YOU ATE MY BROTHER!

16:41.233 --> 16:44.567
- NO, I...

16:44.600 --> 16:47.600
DIDN'T.

16:50.233 --> 16:52.500
- WHOA.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.367
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.200
- DON'T BE NERVOUS.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.700
YOU BUSTED YOUR TAIL ALL DAY
TO LEARN THOSE MOVES.

16:58.733 --> 16:59.833
YOU GOT THIS.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.567
- THANKS.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.900
AND THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

17:02.933 --> 17:04.567
I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO WATCH YOUR GAME.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.467
- NAH, THIS MEANS
MUCH MORE TO ME.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.767
PLUS, MY TEAM
WAS GETTING KILLED.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.633
- WELL,
I SHOULD GO FIND WARREN.

17:11.667 --> 17:14.467
- YOU KNOW, IN MY DAY,
A GENTLEMAN PICKED UP HIS DATE

17:14.500 --> 17:16.333
AND ESCORTED HER TO A DANCE.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.833
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

17:17.867 --> 17:21.100
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU SEE HIM ARRIVE

17:21.133 --> 17:23.833
WITH A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT GIRL.

17:23.867 --> 17:28.167
- OH, THIS BOY
HAS STRUCK A NERVE.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.100
- RAY, LET ME HANDLE THIS.

17:31.133 --> 17:35.100
IT MIGHT NOT BE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.400
- TAYLOR,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:37.433 --> 17:40.533
THIS IS MY DATE, HEATHER.

17:40.567 --> 17:44.100
- IT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.767
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:45.800 --> 17:48.167
- SO THE THING IS, HEATHER'S
MY REGULAR DANCE PARTNER.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.533
BUT WE DIDN'T THINK
SHE COULD MAKE IT

17:49.567 --> 17:51.233
'CAUSE HER SISTER
WAS GETTING MARRIED.

17:51.267 --> 17:55.333
THEN THE WEDDING GOT CANCELED,
SO LUCKY ME, RIGHT?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.500
- WERE YOU EVEN
GOING TO TELL ME?

17:57.533 --> 17:59.400
- I SAW YOUR FRIEND,
AND SHE SAID SHE'D TELL YOU.

17:59.433 --> 18:02.467
- TAYLOR!

18:02.500 --> 18:05.133
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT
TEXT MESSAGE TO GIVE YOU.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.133
- THANKS.
JUST GOT IT.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.333
- WOW, THAT WAS FAST.

18:10.367 --> 18:11.833
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

18:11.867 --> 18:14.533
I HAVE TO GO RESCUE
THE FROZEN BIRD IN THE LOBBY.

18:14.567 --> 18:17.567
- THAT'S AN ICE SCULPTURE.

18:19.867 --> 18:22.267
DON'T YOU THINK YOU
SHOULD'VE CALLED ME YOURSELF?

18:22.300 --> 18:25.400
- LOOK, I CAUGHT
YOUR MOVES AT YOUR HOUSE

18:25.433 --> 18:28.067
AND YOU'RE...
NOT GOOD.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.100
I'VE GOT A TROPHY TO WIN.

18:36.733 --> 18:39.133
- I GUESS IT WAS BETTER
TO FIND OUT

18:39.167 --> 18:41.567
HE WAS A JERK EARLIER
RATHER THAN LATER.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.833
- WOW.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.733
GIRLS ARE SO MATURE.
- THANKS.

18:44.767 --> 18:48.067
- GUYS ON THE OTHER HAND,
WE AREN'T SO MATURE.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.367
THIS CLOWN MESSED
WITH MY GIRL.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.233
I'M GONNA MESS WITH HIM.

18:52.267 --> 18:56.400
- AND NOW TAKING THE FLOOR,
WARREN VANDERVELDE

18:56.433 --> 18:59.100
AND HEATHER LOOKENLAND.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.700
- OKAY, WARREN.

19:04.733 --> 19:07.767
LET'S SEE SOME MOVES.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.733
- I DON'T KNOW!

19:11.767 --> 19:13.333
- IT'S A NEW DANCE!

19:13.367 --> 19:15.433
IT'S CALLED "THE JERK."
HA!

19:15.467 --> 19:17.467
COME HERE, COME HERE.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.400
WATCH ME, WATCH ME NOW.

19:19.433 --> 19:20.633
DO THE THING.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.400
HEY! AND ELVIS.

19:22.433 --> 19:23.767
WHOO!

19:23.800 --> 19:25.333
BEP-BEP-BEP-BEP-BEP.

19:25.367 --> 19:26.600
COME AROUND.
- THIS ISN'T COOL.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.600
- HUH!

19:27.633 --> 19:30.833
NOW SWIM, NOW SWIM.

19:30.867 --> 19:33.267
AND GET UP!
- OH, MY.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.133
- HEY!

19:35.167 --> 19:36.300
- PLEASE, NO.

19:38.867 --> 19:41.867
- AND JAZZ HANDS.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.233
- THAT WAS AWESOME.

19:48.267 --> 19:49.333
THANKS, RAY.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.367
YOU OKAY?
- YEAH.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.633
IT STILL BUGS ME THOUGH.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.600
I DID ALL THAT PRACTICE
FOR NOTHING.

19:54.633 --> 19:56.433
- WELL, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE FOR NOTHING.

19:58.167 --> 19:59.867
- THERE ARE A BUNCH
OF GUYS IN HERE

19:59.900 --> 20:03.467
THAT WOULD LOVE
TO DANCE WITH YOU.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.467
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.633
SHALL WE?

20:08.667 --> 20:12.100
- I CAN THINK
OF NO BETTER PARTNER.

20:12.133 --> 20:15.133
- I'D LOVE TO.

20:24.133 --> 20:26.067
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.200
AND YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.667
HA!

20:29.700 --> 20:32.233
- YEAH,
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.833
- MILES!

20:36.867 --> 20:38.133
MILES.

20:40.233 --> 20:41.833
I'VE SEARCHED
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

20:41.867 --> 20:44.333
MILES ISN'T ANYWHERE.

20:44.367 --> 20:46.700
BROTHER EATER!

20:47.867 --> 20:50.567
- OH.

20:51.733 --> 20:53.800
CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THERE?

20:53.833 --> 20:55.800
- I CAN HEAR YOU, LOUIE.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.433
WHY DID YOU EAT ME,
FRANKIE?

21:04.300 --> 21:06.900
- I TOLD YOU,
THIS IS SO BAD.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.067
IT'S GAME OVER, MAN.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.700
- WE DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

21:11.733 --> 21:13.233
WHAT CAN WE DO?

21:13.267 --> 21:15.433
- THERE'S NOTHING
THAT CAN BE DONE.

21:15.467 --> 21:19.433
MAKE A PINECONE FIGURINE
IN MY MEMORY.

21:19.467 --> 21:20.767
I WILL, BROTHER.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.500
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

21:22.533 --> 21:26.600
I'M A BAD, BAD GHOST.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.433
- YOU SAID IT, NOT ME.

21:30.267 --> 21:31.433
- I GOT YA.

21:31.467 --> 21:34.600
YOU JUST GOT SCHOOLED,
BABY BRO.

21:34.633 --> 21:37.367
YOU TWO NEED A HARD LESSON
IN RESPECTING AUTHORITY.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.667
- THAT'S MY BABYSITTER.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.433
GREAT WORK, MILES.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.400
- HEY!

21:42.433 --> 21:43.600
THAT KIND OF CRUEL TRICK

21:43.633 --> 21:45.700
CAN SCAR A YOUNG CHILD
FOR LIFE!

21:45.733 --> 21:48.733
WISH I THOUGHT OF IT.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.967
- THIS IS AWESOME.

21:56.067 --> 21:57.267
- HEY,
YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING

21:57.300 --> 21:58.567
THAT'LL REALLY
BLOW THEIR MINDS?

21:58.600 --> 22:02.067
- LET'S DO IT.
- WHOO!

22:05.267 --> 22:07.433
- TOO FAR, RAY, TOO FAR.
