01:52.160 --> 01:53.240
[Mia] Going to a new school

01:53.241 --> 01:54.320
is tough enough.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.320
But the sports activities

01:56.360 --> 01:57.620
are definitely not adding

01:57.621 --> 01:58.880
to my overall enjoyment.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.576
- The only good thing
- about my life right now

02:00.600 --> 02:01.920
Is my new book.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.880
DONG!

02:07.120 --> 02:08.639
[all laugh]

02:10.320 --> 02:11.560
Nice one.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.360
It's called Volleyball, not...

02:16.400 --> 02:19.720
Volley... face. [laughs]

02:19.760 --> 02:21.200
[laughs] Good one, Violetta!

02:24.040 --> 02:25.080
[school bell rings]

02:32.760 --> 02:33.920
Hey, don't feel bad

02:33.921 --> 02:35.080
for being uncoordinated.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.420
It's genetic. At least

02:36.421 --> 02:37.720
that's what I tell myself

02:37.760 --> 02:39.400
- every time
- I trip over my own feet.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.840
That's... very comforting.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.880
[laughs] Check out nerd

02:43.881 --> 02:44.881
and nerdy-er.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.080
[laugh mockingly]

02:46.880 --> 02:48.040
Thanks.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.720
Vincent! That's my name!

02:53.760 --> 02:55.000
Not that you asked.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.320
Don't do it with your hands,

03:03.360 --> 03:04.920
- you're gonna
- get fingerprints on it!

03:18.360 --> 03:19.720
Whoa!

03:21.520 --> 03:23.480
- [computer voice] Hi Mia.
- Say your password.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.260
- "I am Mia."

03:25.261 --> 03:27.000
- Password incorrect.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.520
New password.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.120
Maybe...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.140
Elvish runes.

03:41.141 --> 03:42.560
Dad taught me these.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.600
Okay. I can read this.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.800
This doesn't look right...

03:53.840 --> 03:55.120
[Vincent] Are they inverted?

03:55.960 --> 03:57.280
You again?

03:58.480 --> 04:00.920
Sorry! Didn't mean to scare you!

04:00.960 --> 04:03.240
- What do you mean, "inverted"?
- Runes transferred

04:03.280 --> 04:04.920
- From stone to paper
- are sometimes,

04:04.960 --> 04:06.880
You know inverted. Mirrored.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.640
[trumpets playing]

04:11.640 --> 04:13.000
Wow... that's...

04:14.360 --> 04:16.440
thanks... eh... you.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.160
Vincent!

04:20.200 --> 04:21.720
Same as last time!

04:41.360 --> 04:42.800
"Though it may set the ears

04:42.801 --> 04:44.240
to ring,

04:44.280 --> 04:46.780
new hope

04:46.781 --> 04:49.280
its wretched music brings."

04:49.320 --> 04:51.020
[gasps] That's it!

04:51.021 --> 04:52.720
I can read it!

04:52.760 --> 04:54.200
Now what does it mean?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.280
Hi Mia.

05:00.281 --> 05:01.760
Say your password.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.280
[approaching voices]

05:23.320 --> 05:24.760
Hi Mia.

05:24.761 --> 05:26.200
Say your password.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.280
- "Though it may set the ears
- to ring,

05:28.320 --> 05:29.660
New hope

05:29.661 --> 05:31.000
its wretched music brings."

05:33.080 --> 05:35.200
It worked! It worked!

05:41.840 --> 05:44.240
[screams]

05:48.320 --> 05:49.600
[screams]

05:50.400 --> 05:52.120
[grunts]

05:52.160 --> 05:53.760
[spits dust]

05:53.800 --> 05:55.680
- I've gotta work
- on the landing part, though.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.760
Okay. Ears... pointy.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.960
Wings... flappy.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.160
Skirt... Mhmmm...

06:03.200 --> 06:04.440
still too short.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.280
[gasps]

06:07.720 --> 06:09.600
I'm really back!

06:17.840 --> 06:19.720
It's so beautiful.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.280
So peaceful.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.840
- [snorts]

06:23.841 --> 06:25.360
- AAAH! Lyria!

06:25.400 --> 06:26.500
I thought I'd never

06:26.501 --> 06:27.600
get to see you again!

06:27.640 --> 06:28.900
That's the second time

06:28.901 --> 06:30.160
I've landed right near you.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.900
It's like

06:33.901 --> 06:35.200
we're connected somehow.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.760
[trumpet sounds poorly]

06:36.800 --> 06:37.920
[Phuddle] (CRIES) Ooow...

06:37.921 --> 06:39.040
That's it.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.840
I quit! I'm done! Bye bye!

06:42.880 --> 06:44.560
That's gotta be Phuddle.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.000
Duh!

06:50.040 --> 06:52.520
I give up! Never gonna work!

06:52.560 --> 06:54.560
Waste of time!

06:54.600 --> 06:56.960
[gasps] Wait! I've got it!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.840
[creaking noises]

07:00.360 --> 07:03.960
[inhales] BLUUUUUURT!

07:04.000 --> 07:06.040
Aagh! That's it! I'm done!

07:06.041 --> 07:08.080
Piece of junk!

07:08.120 --> 07:09.640
How long has he been doing this?

07:09.680 --> 07:10.920
I heard that!

07:10.921 --> 07:12.160
And the answer is...

07:12.200 --> 07:14.000
all my life.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.700
Do you know I've never done

07:15.701 --> 07:17.360
one thing right, ever!

07:17.400 --> 07:18.760
[chuckles pitifully]

07:18.800 --> 07:20.920
[gasps] Wait! I've got it!

07:24.200 --> 07:25.280
[inhales deeply]

07:25.320 --> 07:27.560
BLUUUUUURT!

07:27.600 --> 07:29.160
Nooo!

07:29.200 --> 07:31.800
I quit! I'm through!

07:31.840 --> 07:33.520
- You ARE dead to me!

07:33.521 --> 07:35.200
- O... kay.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.720
I'll just leave you to this.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.520
Wait! You don't have to go!

07:38.560 --> 07:41.040
Uh... Yes. I do.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.240
No, really.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.640
Don't go! Please!

07:43.680 --> 07:45.400
You could help me fix this!

07:45.440 --> 07:46.880
None of the Pans will help me

07:46.920 --> 07:48.360
- ever since
- the "manure incident",

07:48.400 --> 07:50.520
Which was only mostly my fault.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.240
Sorry, I'd love to help,

07:52.280 --> 07:54.000
- but I'm really here
- to find the elves...

07:54.040 --> 07:56.080
Oooh. Okay.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.720
The elves.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.200
Sure, if that's the way

07:59.201 --> 08:00.640
you wanna go.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.200
I'll just... eh...

08:03.201 --> 08:04.201
you know...

08:04.240 --> 08:05.960
be going. [titters]

08:06.000 --> 08:07.400
By myself.

08:08.680 --> 08:10.040
Alone.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.040
BLUUUUUURT!

08:14.080 --> 08:15.240
Will you please stop

08:15.241 --> 08:16.400
that wretched noise!

08:16.440 --> 08:18.240
It's making my ears ring!

08:19.160 --> 08:20.240
Wait a second.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.560
"Wretched music"!?

08:21.600 --> 08:22.840
BLUUUURT!

08:22.880 --> 08:24.080
"Ears ringing"?

08:24.120 --> 08:25.720
BLUUUUUURT!

08:25.760 --> 08:26.780
[gasps] That's what

08:26.781 --> 08:27.800
it's talking about!

08:27.840 --> 08:29.000
Phuddle!

08:30.280 --> 08:32.000
I think this is important!

08:32.039 --> 08:35.320
My Trumptus? It's not important.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.480
It's scrap metal wrapped in...

08:37.520 --> 08:38.679
stupid!

08:38.720 --> 08:41.000
No, seriously!

08:41.039 --> 08:42.340
Somehow this... thing

08:42.341 --> 08:43.640
is a new hope!

08:43.679 --> 08:45.440
"New hope"?! Well that's...

08:45.480 --> 08:47.080
that's...

08:47.120 --> 08:48.300
- Eh... what does that mean?

08:48.301 --> 08:49.480
- I don't know.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.860
But the elves will!

08:50.861 --> 08:52.200
You have to come with me!

08:52.240 --> 08:53.360
But you want me

08:53.361 --> 08:54.480
to ride a unicorn?!

08:54.520 --> 08:56.400
What are your wings for?

08:56.440 --> 08:57.920
Um... My wings and I

08:57.921 --> 08:59.400
are still getting acquainted.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.600
[snorts]

09:04.640 --> 09:05.680
[snorts]

09:07.600 --> 09:09.080
I'll walk.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.120
- [dings]
- Take me to Yuko and Mo!

09:16.440 --> 09:17.840
Come on Phuddle.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.120
Agh!

09:20.480 --> 09:21.960
Mo! Mia's back!

09:22.000 --> 09:23.840
Wait! Hang on a second.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.320
Come on, hurry up!

09:25.360 --> 09:27.840
Just a sec, I almost got it!

09:30.240 --> 09:33.800
[Phuddle] Wooooah! Look out!

09:33.840 --> 09:35.480
Ahhh!

09:36.800 --> 09:38.800
[Phuddle laughs and screams]

09:38.840 --> 09:40.320
Mo!

09:40.360 --> 09:41.480
- Yuko!

09:41.481 --> 09:42.600
- Whoa! You're back!

09:43.880 --> 09:45.520
Why'd you disappear like that?

09:45.560 --> 09:46.760
I've never seen anybody

09:46.761 --> 09:47.960
just "poof" like that!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.040
Yeah, well, it's new to me too.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.560
I need to talk to you guys!

09:51.600 --> 09:54.080
Got it! Fourteen this week!

09:54.120 --> 09:55.680
Broke my own record again!

09:55.720 --> 09:57.280
Ha ha! You want it?

09:57.320 --> 09:58.380
- What is it?

09:58.381 --> 09:59.440
- A unicorn tear!

09:59.480 --> 10:01.080
Very handy if you need healing.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.320
- Mhmm.
- Aw!

10:03.720 --> 10:05.320
Thank You!

10:05.360 --> 10:07.040
Aaah... That's cool.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.040
- [imitating Mo] Ah...
- That's cool.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.400
And this one's for you.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.320
- Uh!
- I found it yesterday.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.400
Ouuh! [laughs excitedly]

10:14.440 --> 10:15.640
Mmmm...

10:20.880 --> 10:22.520
[Mo] This?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.240
- This is the new hope
- for Centopia?

10:24.280 --> 10:26.100
- I know it seems crazy.

10:26.101 --> 10:27.920
- It's... bent.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.340
So... Where is this book

10:29.341 --> 10:30.720
you were talking about?

10:30.760 --> 10:31.960
I don't have it on me.

10:31.961 --> 10:33.160
I tried to bring it

10:30.760 --> 10:33.160
the last time,

10:33.200 --> 10:34.640
but it doesn't travel well.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.360
- But it's really mystical
- and magical

10:36.400 --> 10:37.840
And it says

10:37.880 --> 10:39.560
- "Though it may set the ears
- to ring,

10:39.600 --> 10:40.720
New hope

10:40.721 --> 10:41.840
its wretched music brings."

10:41.880 --> 10:43.600
"Wretched"?

10:43.640 --> 10:45.060
Kind of an insulting prophecy,

10:45.061 --> 10:46.480
isn't it?

10:46.520 --> 10:47.800
Play it.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.000
Okie dokie.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.480
[clears throat]

10:50.520 --> 10:52.080
[inhales deeply]

10:52.120 --> 10:57.440
BLUUUUUUUUUURPPPP!!

11:00.240 --> 11:02.080
Yeah, pretty wretched.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.500
Ugh... I'm, uh...

11:03.501 --> 11:04.880
still fine tuning it.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.820
That book is ancient,

11:06.821 --> 11:08.720
but somehow it knew

11:04.920 --> 11:08.720
I would find this.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.360
That has to mean something.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.540
I just don't know

11:11.541 --> 11:12.680
what "new hope" means.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.720
What "new hope"

11:13.721 --> 11:14.721
does Centopia need?

11:16.400 --> 11:17.800
You really aren't

11:17.801 --> 11:19.200
from around here, are you?

11:19.240 --> 11:20.780
Maybe we should show her

11:20.781 --> 11:22.320
the Flowering Thicket.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.440
This...

11:26.480 --> 11:28.240
is the Flowering Thicket.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.880
But... it's... totally dead.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.200
How does this happen?

11:37.240 --> 11:39.480
One word... Panthea.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.640
[Mo] The Munculus Queen.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.880
- She's been rounding up unicorns
- by the dozen

11:45.920 --> 11:47.760
And stealing their horns.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.120
[neighs]

11:50.440 --> 11:52.040
[cackles wickedly]

11:52.080 --> 11:54.160
- [Mo] Their power
- keeps her from getting old.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.760
[continues cackling]

12:03.280 --> 12:04.860
The more unicorns she takes,

12:04.861 --> 12:06.440
the more the island dies.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.860
It's the unicorn horns

12:07.861 --> 12:09.240
that keep everything alive.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.540
Sometimes they leave dust

12:10.541 --> 12:11.800
from their horns around,

12:11.840 --> 12:13.040
and if we find enough of it

12:13.041 --> 12:14.240
we can help out a bit.

12:14.280 --> 12:15.960
- [Mo] But we can't do it
- without them.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.760
- Without the unicorns
- and their horns,

12:17.800 --> 12:19.080
Everything dies.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.480
And once it's dead,

12:22.120 --> 12:24.160
it's dead.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.460
- Nothing can bring it back.

12:25.461 --> 12:26.720
- It won't be long

12:26.760 --> 12:27.820
before the whole island

12:27.821 --> 12:28.880
turns to desert.

12:28.920 --> 12:29.920
No more plants.

12:29.921 --> 12:30.921
No more unicorns.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.000
No more pans. No more us.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.080
Just Panthea and her munculus.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.000
[weeps]

12:38.040 --> 12:40.240
- That has to be
- what the book was talking about.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.080
Somehow this...

12:42.081 --> 12:43.880
can stop that. But how?

12:43.920 --> 12:45.800
- I'm starting to think
- nothing can stop that.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.840
Let me see some of that dust.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.640
- You really think
- that's going to work?

12:51.680 --> 12:52.780
I don't know.

12:52.781 --> 12:53.880
I have to try something.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.180
Hey, if you're gonna try it,

12:55.181 --> 12:56.440
try it right.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.400
Go big or go home!

12:58.440 --> 13:01.560
[inhales] BLUUUURRP!

13:01.600 --> 13:04.160
Achooo!

13:04.200 --> 13:05.360
Was that sneeze hopeful

13:05.361 --> 13:06.520
in any way?

13:06.560 --> 13:07.760
[grunts angrily]

13:09.040 --> 13:10.640
[Mia] Okay, that wasn't it.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.560
- But if there's even a chance
- that I'm right,

13:12.600 --> 13:14.800
- Don't you have to take it?
- I can't get distracted

13:14.840 --> 13:16.280
By some crazy riddle

13:16.281 --> 13:17.720
about the worst trumpet ever...

13:17.760 --> 13:19.600
Worst trumpTUS ever.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.360
From a book I've never seen.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.160
No. I'm a prince.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.160
- I'm sorry,
- Mia, I have stuff to do.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.560
Mo! Wait a second.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.200
I believe her.

13:35.201 --> 13:36.800
I don't know why. It's just...

13:36.840 --> 13:38.760
- the way she showed up
- out of nowhere.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.980
And the way she disappeared

13:39.981 --> 13:41.160
in a "poof" like that.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.760
Again, that was awesome!

13:44.680 --> 13:45.740
And don't forget

13:45.741 --> 13:46.800
she can talk to unicorns.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.736
- You wouldn't have believed
- that either, would you?

13:48.760 --> 13:49.960
There's definitely

13:49.961 --> 13:51.160
something special about her.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.400
But, you know,

13:52.401 --> 13:53.600
you're the prince, so...

13:53.640 --> 13:55.376
- What if you're wrong?
- Then you look stupid

13:55.400 --> 13:56.580
And the King makes you mop

13:56.581 --> 13:57.760
the floors or something.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.720
Big deal. What if you're wrong?

14:07.840 --> 14:09.120
[elves gasp]

14:09.160 --> 14:10.880
What's everybody looking at?

14:10.920 --> 14:12.180
No unicorn has ever entered

14:12.181 --> 14:13.440
the palace before.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.540
Especially not

14:14.541 --> 14:15.600
with an elf on its back.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.980
[Mo] Father, this is the elf

14:23.981 --> 14:25.200
I told you about.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.880
[Raynor] So...

14:26.920 --> 14:28.160
This is the elf who can talk

14:28.161 --> 14:29.400
to the unicorns,

14:29.440 --> 14:30.760
is it?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.200
What is your name?

14:32.240 --> 14:34.680
Mia, sir. Um, sire.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.160
Your majesty.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.800
Should I be bowing?

14:37.840 --> 14:39.380
[Mayla] No no, dear,

14:39.381 --> 14:40.920
we're all friends here.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.140
Very well then,

14:42.141 --> 14:43.320
let's hear this instrument.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.520
The "new hope for Centopia".

14:45.560 --> 14:47.040
Step forward!

14:50.440 --> 14:51.720
[coughs]

14:51.760 --> 14:53.280
Bbrrrrr...

14:53.320 --> 14:54.680
[lip smacking]

14:54.720 --> 14:56.040
ba ba baah...

14:56.080 --> 14:57.680
[inhales, exhales]

14:57.720 --> 14:59.400
Oh... It gets better.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.720
[inhales deeply]

15:01.760 --> 15:05.240
BLUUUUUUUUUURRPPPP...

15:05.280 --> 15:06.720
[glass breaks]

15:06.760 --> 15:10.560
BLUUUUUURRRRRPP!

15:12.040 --> 15:13.320
[breaking glass noise]

15:17.600 --> 15:21.080
I'll just... slink over there.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.600
- I know how this sounds.

15:27.601 --> 15:28.880
- It sounds...

15:28.920 --> 15:30.020
like an asthmatic elephant

15:30.021 --> 15:31.120
being throttled

15:31.160 --> 15:33.060
by another asthmatic elephant

15:33.061 --> 15:34.960
standing on a duck.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.440
[Mayla] Really, Ray.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.520
It's all right,

15:37.521 --> 15:38.560
Mia, we won't bite.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.420
But just what exactly is it

15:40.421 --> 15:42.240
you expect the king to do?

15:42.280 --> 15:43.940
I don't know.

15:43.941 --> 15:45.600
I just think this is important.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.060
I think it can stop Panthea

15:47.061 --> 15:48.480
somehow. And I thought...

15:48.520 --> 15:49.620
the king is wise,

15:49.621 --> 15:50.720
maybe he'll know how.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.200
Each day I try to predict

15:55.201 --> 15:56.880
what Panthea will do next.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.020
And each day

15:58.021 --> 15:59.120
she takes more unicorns,

15:59.160 --> 16:01.760
and more of our island from us.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.640
Foresight, prophecy,

16:03.641 --> 16:05.480
would be a great gift indeed.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.120
[sighs deeply]

16:07.160 --> 16:08.220
But a king does not have

16:08.221 --> 16:09.280
the luxury of acting

16:09.320 --> 16:11.160
on faith or supposition.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.000
He can only act on what is sure.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.880
And about this "Trumptus",

16:14.920 --> 16:16.880
even you seem unsure.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.800
- Not what you wanted to hear,
- is it, Mia?

16:20.840 --> 16:22.600
No, ma'am.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.360
The king for all his jokes

16:24.361 --> 16:26.080
and riddles, is wise.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.360
I learned long ago

16:27.361 --> 16:28.600
to trust that.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.520
- And there is wisdom
- in you too, Mia.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.640
If the Trumptus is a new hope,

16:32.680 --> 16:34.320
you may yet find it.

16:34.321 --> 16:35.960
And we will see you again.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.900
[Phuddle] I've never been

16:42.901 --> 16:44.600
so humiliated in my life.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.560
Ah, who am I kidding huh?

16:46.600 --> 16:48.100
I get that humiliated

16:48.101 --> 16:49.600
three times before breakfast.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.860
I can't believe

16:50.861 --> 16:52.080
I let you talk me into that.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.600
[Mia] I'm sorry, everyone.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.640
I really thought

16:54.641 --> 16:55.641
this meant something.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.000
Maybe I missed a word.

16:57.001 --> 16:58.320
Maybe it wasn't finished.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.600
I don't know.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.840
But I know it's important.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
I need to go back

17:01.881 --> 17:02.881
and check my book again.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.119
- So you're leaving again?

17:04.121 --> 17:05.320
- Do you know which way to go?

17:05.359 --> 17:06.920
I've got a pretty good idea.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.960
Well, give us a call

17:07.961 --> 17:08.961
when you get back!

17:10.800 --> 17:11.839
- [Yuko] You know how!

17:11.840 --> 17:12.880
- [Mo] Bye, Mia!

17:12.920 --> 17:15.319
[Mia] Bye, Yuko! Bye, Mo!

17:16.839 --> 17:17.940
"Though it may

17:17.941 --> 17:19.040
set the ears to ring,

17:19.079 --> 17:20.339
new hope

17:20.340 --> 17:21.599
its wretched music brings."

17:21.640 --> 17:23.079
I don't get it.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.640
[neighs]

17:24.680 --> 17:26.640
- Quiet?
- What do you mean "it's quiet"?

17:26.680 --> 17:28.359
- [neighs]
- Who's coming?!

17:28.400 --> 17:29.600
[snorts]

17:37.600 --> 17:39.520
Yuko! Mo!

17:42.280 --> 17:43.440
Nooo!

17:44.320 --> 17:46.080
BLUUUUURRRP!

17:46.120 --> 17:47.800
[shrieks]

17:52.680 --> 17:54.520

17:55.480 --> 17:56.520
[grunts]

18:00.360 --> 18:01.600

18:03.400 --> 18:06.800
[inhales] BLUUUUUUURPP!

18:06.840 --> 18:08.400
[shrieks]

18:11.040 --> 18:12.080
[gasps]

18:13.640 --> 18:15.200
That's it. I get it!

18:15.201 --> 18:16.760
I finally get it!

18:19.880 --> 18:21.080
[neighs]

18:21.120 --> 18:22.200
[sighs]

18:28.360 --> 18:29.800
RAAAHHH!

18:29.840 --> 18:31.080
Munculus! Behind us!

18:31.120 --> 18:32.600
Yuko you go right, I'll go...

18:32.640 --> 18:33.840
Left, got it!

18:35.040 --> 18:38.800
[neighing and growling]

18:40.840 --> 18:42.360
FSHHH

18:43.880 --> 18:44.920
FSHHH

18:46.120 --> 18:47.200
Oof!

18:47.240 --> 18:48.360
Mo!

18:51.680 --> 18:53.640
- Ou!
- Yuko!

18:58.480 --> 19:00.120
[snarling]

19:02.520 --> 19:08.280
[blowing Trumptus]

19:10.520 --> 19:13.000
[blowing Trumptus]

19:14.320 --> 19:15.480
[neighs]

19:19.000 --> 19:20.520
[Mo] Yes Mia!

19:20.560 --> 19:21.620
- We did it!

19:21.621 --> 19:22.680
- That was awesome!

19:22.720 --> 19:23.780
That kinda gives me

19:23.781 --> 19:24.840
some new hope.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.020
[Yuko] (LAUGHS) Did you

19:26.021 --> 19:27.160
see that?

19:27.200 --> 19:30.240
Ha ha! We did it! Wohoo!

19:35.760 --> 19:37.680
- [Raynor] Our elf warriors
- are strong,

19:37.720 --> 19:40.240
- And their waterglares
- have defended the unicorns well.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.480
But this... this Trumptus

19:42.520 --> 19:44.480
- has proven to have power
- over the munculus

19:44.520 --> 19:46.480
We only dreamed of before,

19:46.520 --> 19:48.020
that I believe could turn

19:48.021 --> 19:49.520
the tide against Panthea,

19:49.560 --> 19:51.240
and save Centopia.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.880
New hope indeed.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.000
For the Trumptus, we owe you

19:57.001 --> 19:59.080
a great thanks, Pan Phuddle.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.560
I'm sorry.

20:01.760 --> 20:05.600
Wait, did you say "thanks"?

20:05.640 --> 20:07.920
Yes, he did. As do I.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.160
We all say thanks.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.040
[chuckling] Wow.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.840
I've never heard that word

20:12.841 --> 20:14.600
used so close to my name.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.480
I like the sound of it!

20:16.520 --> 20:17.960
And there is something

20:17.961 --> 20:19.400
very special about you, Mia.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.840
- Of that I have no doubt.

20:20.841 --> 20:22.240
- Told ya.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.120
Tell me, does this book of yours

20:24.121 --> 20:25.960
contain more of these "oracles"?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.520
I don't know. But I promise,

20:27.521 --> 20:29.040
I'm going to find out.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.496
- [Yuko] Are you sure you don't
- want us to come with you?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.200
- I know
- we don't seem like much fun.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.840
But we are!

20:38.880 --> 20:40.260
Trust me, where I'm going,

20:40.261 --> 20:41.640
I have to go alone.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.140
- Maybe someday, though, right?

20:43.141 --> 20:44.600
- Yeah. Maybe someday.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.680
Okay bye!

20:46.720 --> 20:48.400
Bye, Mia!

20:48.440 --> 20:50.256
- [Yuko] Next time
- I'm staying for the "poof",

20:50.280 --> 20:52.080
Mr. Can't-Wait-Five-Seconds!

20:53.720 --> 20:54.800
I'll just be going...

20:54.801 --> 20:55.880
[chuckles nervously]

20:55.920 --> 20:57.040
I know

20:57.041 --> 20:58.160
you just like my Trumptus

20:58.200 --> 21:00.640
and not me, so...

21:00.680 --> 21:02.240
- you know, I'll...
- You know what?

21:02.280 --> 21:03.920
- You were kind of annoying
- at first.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.160
But now that I know you...

21:05.161 --> 21:06.360
I do like you.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.800
[over-eager] Really? What is it

21:07.801 --> 21:09.200
about me, my personality

21:09.240 --> 21:10.620
or the way I don't smell

21:10.621 --> 21:12.000
like compost anymore?

21:12.040 --> 21:13.360
[♪♪♪]

21:13.400 --> 21:14.600
- I hear Pans, Phuddle.

21:14.601 --> 21:15.800
- OHH!

21:15.840 --> 21:17.120
I kinda sorta shouldn't really

21:17.121 --> 21:18.400
be seen talking to an elf.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.660
If anybody asks,

21:19.661 --> 21:20.880
you never saw me!

21:25.080 --> 21:26.640
I have to go. If there are

21:26.641 --> 21:28.200
any more oracles in that book,

21:28.240 --> 21:29.560
I have to find them.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.840
I'll be back. I promise.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.160
WOW.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.920
Hi.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.360
Hi.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.720
I'm Mia.

22:27.360 --> 22:28.800
- I'm...
- Vincent.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.320
I know. I heard the first time.

22:32.240 --> 22:33.920
So Vincent, how come you know

22:33.921 --> 22:35.600
so much about runes?

22:35.640 --> 22:37.060
A better question would be,

22:37.061 --> 22:38.480
how can you have such

22:35.640 --> 22:38.480
a big book about runes

22:38.520 --> 22:40.520
and know so little?

22:41.305 --> 22:47.495
