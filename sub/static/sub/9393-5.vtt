00:35.902 --> 00:37.503
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.239
This just in: Wanted fugitive,
Bobby "The Shirt" Briggs,

00:40.241 --> 00:42.674
notorious for always wearing
shirts while committing

00:42.676 --> 00:44.309
his crimes,
has finally been caught

00:44.311 --> 00:46.145
after 15 years on the lam.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.147
A police spokesperson
was quoted as saying,

00:48.149 --> 00:49.581
"Duh, I'm a dumb cop.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.383
I like to give
Tom Tucker a ticket."

00:51.385 --> 00:53.052
I was going, like, 41.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.054
Oh, my God,
I don't believe it.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.322
They finally got that
son of a bitch, Briggs.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.323
You know that guy?

00:58.325 --> 01:00.025
You're damn right, I do.

01:00.027 --> 01:03.062
Bobby Briggs is the one who
put me in this wheelchair.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.763
(crying):
They got him.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.031
They finally got him.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.833
Geez, Joe, you okay?

01:07.835 --> 01:10.502
(crying)

01:10.504 --> 01:12.404
Here, use my handkerchief.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.872
It's wet and cold.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.274
Well, yeah,
it's my handkerchief.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.042
I've been blowing
my nose in it all day.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.411
Wait a minute, Bobby Briggs
is the one who crippled you?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.046
You always told us
you fell off a roof

01:21.048 --> 01:22.247
during a fight with the Grinch.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.416
(sighs) I lied.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.719
I lied because I was ashamed
of the real story:

01:27.721 --> 01:30.055
that I let a vicious
criminal get away.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.123
What happened?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.724
Well, it was 1996.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.693
Briggs was one of the
biggest heroin dealers

01:34.695 --> 01:37.029
east of Providence, which is
mostly just open water,

01:37.031 --> 01:40.132
but still, I'd been undercover,
tracking his operation

01:40.134 --> 01:43.836
for six months and had finally
gained his confidence.

01:48.208 --> 01:50.209
<i>I had almost</i>
<i>gathered enough evidence</i>

01:50.211 --> 01:52.077
<i>to put Briggs away for good,</i>

01:52.079 --> 01:53.212
<i>but I knew a taped confession</i>

01:53.214 --> 01:54.746
<i>would make the case</i>
<i>a slam dunk.</i>

01:54.748 --> 01:56.782
This is gonna take us
to the next level.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.817
We're gonna be banging
so many hot chicks

01:58.819 --> 02:00.385
with jeans up to
their navels.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.654
Bobby Briggs, you're
really good at heroin.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.957
How much heroin
is here, Bobby Briggs?

02:04.959 --> 02:06.325
Why are you
talking like that?

02:06.327 --> 02:08.160
Are you wearing a wire?

02:09.329 --> 02:11.964
Oh, you're dead,
Joe Swansonson.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.233
<i>My undercover name</i>
<i>was Swansonson.</i>

02:14.235 --> 02:15.400
Easy, Briggs.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.903
You kill a cop,
they'll put you away forever.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.606
Then get ready to spend
the rest of your life

02:20.608 --> 02:23.175
as a lame gimp
with an annoying-voiced wife.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.243
<i>He'd met Bonnie.</i>

02:24.245 --> 02:27.179
(screaming in pain)

02:28.948 --> 02:30.616
<i>Briggs got away,</i>

02:30.618 --> 02:32.317
and I've been in this wheelchair
ever since.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.253
I like that you
can tell me a story

02:34.255 --> 02:36.355
starting at the Clam
and ending on a Ferris wheel.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.756
Yeah, people
are starving in Africa,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.258
and I'm at a carnival

02:39.260 --> 02:41.460
with my best buddies
on a beautiful night.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.196
Blessings. Blessings.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.969
So, Joe, it must
feel great to finally

02:50.971 --> 02:52.704
have some closure
with Bobby Briggs.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.006
Yeah.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.175
You know last night was
the first time in 15 years

02:56.177 --> 02:57.843
I didn't strangle
Bonnie in my sleep?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.444
Okay.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.514
Hey, Dad, you're gonna
want to see this.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.884
Again recapping
our breaking news,

03:05.886 --> 03:09.188
longtime fugitive Bobby Briggs
has escaped from police custody.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.456
His whereabouts
are currently unknown.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.892
News of Briggs's escape
first broke on Telemundo,

03:13.894 --> 03:15.327
if you can believe that.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.729
<i>Escapo!</i>
<i>Escapo! Escapo!</i>

03:17.731 --> 03:20.132
Briggs reportedly escaped
during a prison open house,

03:20.134 --> 03:23.168
an event that will most likely
be canceled in the future.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.704
No, no!
I can't believe it.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.306
Oh, don't worry, Joe,
they'll get him back.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.540
No, they won't!

03:28.542 --> 03:31.043
It took 15 years
to catch him.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.078
Well, this seems like a good
time to be heading out.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.479
I should be getting back anyway.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.181
I left Rupert with a sitter.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.482
Well, you know
where everything is.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.818
Feel free to help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

03:39.820 --> 03:44.656
And Mr. Con Man here can have
pudding or ice cream, not both.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.229
Chief, can I have a word?

03:50.231 --> 03:52.097
Yeah, but first,
you have to agree

03:52.099 --> 03:53.565
there's a huge
difference

03:53.567 --> 03:55.701
between bisexual men
and homosexual men.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.269
Sure, Chief.
Thank you. Huge.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.104
What is it?

03:59.106 --> 04:00.606
Well, Chief, I'm here
because I want you

04:00.608 --> 04:02.174
to put me on the Briggs case.

04:02.176 --> 04:03.342
Absolutely not.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.109
Come on, Chief!

04:04.111 --> 04:05.110
I know everything about Briggs.

04:05.112 --> 04:07.179
I'm the only one
who can catch him.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.414
No, Swanson, you're
too close to the case.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.116
I'm putting Officers
Grant and Casey on it

04:11.118 --> 04:13.051
because they're so
far from the case,

04:13.053 --> 04:14.519
they don't care
about it at all.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.221
Hi, Chief.
Hi.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.422
This isn't fair!

04:17.424 --> 04:19.358
Swanson, you know
your assignment.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.892
You get me the guy who's
been rubbing his butt

04:20.894 --> 04:22.594
all over Dunkin' Donuts.

04:23.563 --> 04:24.896
Can I help you?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.365
Not illegal. Not illegal.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.133
Show me the law.
Not illegal.

04:32.038 --> 04:34.139
Hey, Joe, look,
I know you're down

04:34.141 --> 04:36.375
about this Briggs thing,
and that kind of bums me out,

04:36.377 --> 04:38.143
so I got you
this Cookie Puss.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.278
(laughs)
Isn't that funny?

04:39.280 --> 04:41.380
Look at that weird nose.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.582
I think your nose
is weird.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.150
Guys, I'm telling you, I...

04:45.152 --> 04:47.486
I just don't think
I could live with Briggs

04:47.488 --> 04:49.588
on the lam for another 15 years.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.423
Well, why don't you
do something about it?

04:51.425 --> 04:53.659
I can't do anything about it.
The chief won't let me.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.093
Joe, if they don't
find this guy,

04:55.095 --> 04:57.329
it's gonna eat you alive
for the rest of your life.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.964
You got to take matters
into your own hands.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.399
You got to go after this guy.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.301
But that's a breach
of police protocol.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.935
This isn't about you
as a cop.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.304
This is
about you as a man.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.105
Come on, what do you say?

05:07.107 --> 05:09.174
Quagmire and I will help you
bring this guy to justice.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.609
(chuckles) Peter,
what did I say

05:10.611 --> 05:12.678
about you volunteering
me for (bleep)?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.780
All right, let's do it!

05:14.782 --> 05:16.415
MAYOR WEST:
Well, if you're gonna do it,

05:16.417 --> 05:19.351
you're gonna need someone
who's very good at disguise.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.819
Who said that?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.821
I'd love to go with you,
but I can't.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.356
I'm supposed to be
the gift table

05:24.358 --> 05:26.425
at a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.132
All right, if we're
gonna go after Briggs,

05:34.134 --> 05:36.068
this might be a good
place to start.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.105
I've spent the
last 15 years

05:40.107 --> 05:41.673
gathering
information on him,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.308
and it's all here.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.143
Every crime he's committed,
every associate he's...

05:45.145 --> 05:47.779
Oh, look, Briggs
was All-County JV swimming.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.548
Well, I don't just
focus on the negative.

05:49.550 --> 05:53.118
Joe, your 25-year-old son
and your baby daughter share

05:53.120 --> 05:55.454
a room just so you can keep
a weirdo <i>Beautiful Mind</i> room?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.055
Isn't that a little bizarre?

05:57.057 --> 06:00.992
And then we dug the bullets out
of that Iraqi family's skulls

06:00.994 --> 06:02.861
so they couldn't
be traced back to us.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.330
MAN'S VOICE:
<i>Today, I saw a balloon.</i>

06:05.332 --> 06:07.966
Briggs' FBI profile
says the only relationship

06:07.968 --> 06:11.703
he's maintained over the years
is with a stripper named Tanya.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.071
Tax records show
she currently works

06:13.073 --> 06:14.840
at a club in Atlantic City.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.041
So that's our first stop.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.642
Is there touching
at the club?

06:17.644 --> 06:20.145
I-I-I don't know,
Peter. Maybe.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.646
Okay, this is good,
this is good.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.815
I'll be sure to pack
my blamming jeans.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.253
Hey, listen,
thanks for agreeing

06:28.255 --> 06:30.555
to take care of Principessa
while we're gone, Lois.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.690
It's our pleasure.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.924
She looks like
a nice kitty.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.693
Uh, kitty?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.194
Lois, she is
a purebred Persian.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.264
I can trace her lineage
to the cats kept by Cleopatra.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.099
Just tell me what
I need to do, Glenn.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.901
Well, first, she has
a very active bowel.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.103
You can't be too generous
with the baby wipes.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.205
Stroke front to back
like you would on yourself.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.574
Otherwise, you're smashing
feces into her genitals.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.909
Also, she's very skittish,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.944
so you have to
touch her like this.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.614
I'm going to touch you now.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.782
Is that okay?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.617
See how I'm going?

06:58.619 --> 07:03.622
Slowly, slowly.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.591
Oh, the mysteries
you keep inside of you.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.094
PETER:
Quagmire, come on,
let's go.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.195
(car engine starts)

07:10.197 --> 07:11.963
All right, I guess we're off.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.198
Hey, you guys,
check out the look

07:13.200 --> 07:14.966
on Lois's face
when I do this.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.802
(tires screech)

07:16.804 --> 07:18.136
Peter!

07:18.138 --> 07:20.038
Clean that up, you idiot!

07:20.040 --> 07:21.306
Love you.

07:27.980 --> 07:31.082
Boy, it'll be satisfying
to finally slap the cuffs

07:31.084 --> 07:32.951
on Briggs once and for all.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.053
Hey, you ever just drive
through a town and wonder,

07:35.055 --> 07:37.222
"Who the hell lives here?"
All the time.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.124
Look at this place.
I mean, what-what's going on?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.226
There's an adult
with a lemonade stand.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.061
That Chinese restaurant
still has the sign

07:43.063 --> 07:44.229
from when it was a mechanic.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.797
I don't want to eat lo mein

07:45.799 --> 07:47.232
where they were
just changing mufflers.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.835
There's an apartment
above that Arby's.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.570
With toys in the window.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.171
Someone has built
a life up there.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.573
What a mess.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.141
I'm telling you,
the Founding Fathers would be

07:56.143 --> 07:58.176
very disappointed in
where their country ended up.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.145
Eh, it wasn't so perfect
back then, either.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.080
And so I say unto you,

08:02.082 --> 08:04.983
sons of liberty,
no longer will free men

08:04.985 --> 08:08.086
live under the yoke
of giant predatory birds.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.690
Shrieking, swooping down,
stealing our livestock.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.991
What's going on in here?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.994
N-Nothing, uh, just
bellyaching about the British.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.829
Get back to warming
those eggs.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.000
(muffled music playing)

08:22.002 --> 08:23.602
(brakes screech)

08:23.604 --> 08:25.737
♪

08:27.974 --> 08:29.674
All right,
this is the place.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.310
We got to see if we
can find Briggs's girl.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.979
Hey, we're looking
for a stripper named Tanya.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.113
She here tonight?

08:35.115 --> 08:37.048
Yeah, she's working
the Champagne Room.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.750
Follow me.

08:40.286 --> 08:41.887
Hey, Quagmire, you, uh...

08:41.889 --> 08:43.722
you ever been to
Atlantic City before?

08:43.724 --> 08:45.957
Once, about 20
years ago. Why?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.626
All right!
All right!

08:47.628 --> 08:49.327
All right!
All right!

08:49.329 --> 08:51.997
Hey, are you Tanya?

08:51.999 --> 08:53.532
Yeah. Who are you?

08:53.534 --> 08:55.166
A guy who's looking
for Bobby Briggs.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.167
Where is he?

08:56.169 --> 08:57.836
I don't know any Bobby Briggs.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.804
And even if I did,
I wouldn't tell you.

08:59.806 --> 09:00.705
You're lying!

09:00.707 --> 09:02.240
Joe, let me handle this.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.808
I know how to communicate
with strippers.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.176
All I need is one dance,

09:05.178 --> 09:07.345
and I'll know
everything she knows.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.480
You free for a dance?

09:08.482 --> 09:10.382
Sure.

09:11.817 --> 09:12.817
I need information.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.352
I was molested by my dad.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.254
I know that.
I need other information.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.857
I want you to tell me
where I can find Bobby Briggs.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.759
Come on, you know
I can't give out

09:20.761 --> 09:22.360
a client's personal
information.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.864
All right, I'm gonna have
to do the Vulcan V-Meld.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.999
♪

09:36.909 --> 09:38.843
He lives at 2820
Ocean Boulevard,

09:38.845 --> 09:40.845
across from the park,
apartment two.

09:40.847 --> 09:41.780
Atta girl.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.282
Okay, now spit
in your own mouth.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.284
This is a cool place.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.390
Boy, it sure is nice having
Mr. Quagmire's cat around.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.926
I got to say, cats are
so much better than dogs.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.862
Well, that's kind of
a broad statement.
It's true.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.265
Okay, show me one way in which
cats are better than dogs.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.233
Well, okay, uh,
for one thing,

10:02.235 --> 10:03.902
they always land
on their feet.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.303
Watch.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.138
So? Big deal.
Dogs do that, too.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.975
Here, go ahead, do what you
just did, but with me.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.810
Ow! Oh, my God!

10:11.812 --> 10:13.311
Oh, my neck! Ow!

10:13.313 --> 10:15.113
Oh, my God, Brian!

10:15.115 --> 10:17.215
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
Call somebody! Oh!

10:17.217 --> 10:18.817
We need one of
those boards

10:18.819 --> 10:20.885
they use for
football players! Ow!

10:20.887 --> 10:22.220
Hey, what's going on?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.421
Nothing.

10:23.423 --> 10:27.158
I just figured out
why cats are better than babies.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.294
Well, that's kind of
a broad statement.

10:31.430 --> 10:34.866
Okay, 2820 Ocean,
this is it.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.507
All right, apartment number two.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.009
We'll just pick the lock.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.315
What? What is that?

10:50.317 --> 10:54.019
Let's use our eyes to see.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.791
Aw, this guy has sugar cereals.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.426
His mom must be so cool.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.161
And he's got a trash compactor.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.797
(machine clattering)

11:05.799 --> 11:07.365
It compacted it all.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.334
That is so boss.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.375
Aha! We meet again, Briggs.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.610
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who are you?

11:18.612 --> 11:20.178
Joe Swanson.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.312
Who?

11:21.314 --> 11:24.282
Wait, you... you
don't remember me?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.351
I infiltrated your
heroin operation.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.219
We saw <i>Reality Bites</i>
<i>together.</i>

11:28.221 --> 11:30.221
(Joe groans)

11:30.223 --> 11:32.490
You guys, I found him!

11:32.492 --> 11:34.292
He went that way!

11:39.832 --> 11:41.633
(grunts)

11:49.642 --> 11:51.710
(cell phone ringing)

11:51.712 --> 11:53.078
Damn it. That's Lois.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.979
If I don't get this,
she's going to kill me.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.881
(grunting)

11:59.418 --> 12:01.386
Hi, sweetie.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.488
Yeah, everything's great.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.890
Of course, I miss you.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.526
Well, how does the supermarket
run out of parsley?

12:08.528 --> 12:10.161
I'm as angry as you are.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.796
Peter, I'm going to fall!

12:20.606 --> 12:22.607
It looks like
you're out of roof.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.351
Damn it.
There's no way across.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.520
Spidey, can you swing us
across with your web?

12:35.522 --> 12:37.455
No, I can't
swing you across.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.457
And it's Spider-Man,
not Spidey.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.259
I'm pretty sure I've heard
people call you Spidey.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.594
Yeah, close friends.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.895
What's your name?
Peter.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.530
Hey, Petey,
do stuff for me.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.699
Oh, I don't like that.
Yeah, you don't like it.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.801
And you're a fat nobody,
and I'm (bleep) Spider-Man,

12:49.803 --> 12:51.669
so how do you
think I feel?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.908
He's getting away.
Guys, drop me over the side!

12:56.910 --> 12:58.109
Are you crazy, Joe?!

12:58.111 --> 12:59.377
That fall
will kill you.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.513
Not if I land on my legs.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.450
(grunting)

13:05.452 --> 13:07.285
PETER:
Heads up.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.488
(panting)

13:11.657 --> 13:13.525
I got you now, Briggs.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.340
CROWD:
Move that bus!

13:29.342 --> 13:31.943
(cheering)

13:31.945 --> 13:33.478
(gasps)

13:33.480 --> 13:36.181
Enjoy your new home.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.983
He's gone, you guys!

13:38.985 --> 13:40.185
I had him!

13:40.187 --> 13:41.653
That was our one chance!

13:41.655 --> 13:42.921
It's all right, Joe.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.355
You got nothing
to be ashamed of.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.490
You're a great cop

13:45.492 --> 13:46.624
with a very
distinguished career.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.293
You caught that guy
who was killing

13:48.295 --> 13:49.494
all those
Filipino girls.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.196
Yeah, but this was important!

13:51.198 --> 13:52.964
This was the guy
who ruined my life.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.333
The one perp
who meant everything to me.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.434
If I caught this guy,

13:56.436 --> 13:58.336
I'd finally be able
to sleep at night.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.504
Damn it!

13:59.506 --> 14:00.338
(siren whoops)

14:00.340 --> 14:02.006
Oh, thank God. Cops.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.041
Oh, good.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.342
You guys
can still catch Briggs.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.476
He's headed that way.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.377
We're not here for him.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.645
We're here for you guys.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.147
You're under arrest
for interfering

14:09.149 --> 14:10.682
with a police
investigation.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.816
What?

14:11.818 --> 14:13.284
Yeah, what the hell?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.386
You should be out there
arresting the real criminals.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.521
Like switchblade-wielding
white guys

14:16.523 --> 14:19.624
from movies and TV
who don't talk like people talk.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.692
Easy, mama.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.293
Hand over that purse,
and everything

14:22.295 --> 14:24.429
will be real cool,
you dig?

14:28.968 --> 14:31.135
Guys, you got to let us
out of here.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.872
Yeah, the bastard's
making a break for it,

14:33.874 --> 14:35.573
just like
South America.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.075
Hmm.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.310
Lot of black guys over there.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.979
Hey, man,
where you going?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.313
I'll be back.
I'm coming back.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.681
I'll be right back.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.149
Why would the cops
arrest us

14:45.151 --> 14:47.318
instead of going
after Briggs?

14:49.989 --> 14:51.389
Flannigan?
Wait a minute.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.725
That's one of the corrupt cops
who helped harbor Briggs

14:53.727 --> 14:55.660
while he was on the lam
for 15 years.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.195
These guys are bad news.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.062
Oh, my God.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.864
What are they
going to do to us?

14:59.866 --> 15:01.766
We're not going to stick around
to find out.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.601
Joe, hold your handcuffs
over my lap.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.702
(zip)

15:04.704 --> 15:06.004
What the hell is that?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.071
Swiss Army penis.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.573
(sawing)

15:08.575 --> 15:10.275
Wow, Quagmire.
That's incredible.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.676
Peter?

15:11.678 --> 15:12.777
(sawing)

15:12.779 --> 15:14.445
Yours are made
of a stronger metal.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.582
We're going to have to go
with the acetylene torch penis.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.117
Don't...
don't look right at it.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.253
My STDs help it
burn brighter.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.189
The keys are in
the ignition. Let's go!

15:27.259 --> 15:29.627
I told you to search
that guy's penis.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.863
You say that
about everybody.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.033
Yeah, we did it!
But we lost Briggs.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.634
How are we
going to find him now?

15:36.636 --> 15:37.969
We got nothing.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.971
Well, I don't know if
it helps, but I found

15:39.973 --> 15:41.739
this number next to the
phone in his kitchen.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.708
I was saving it 'cause
I was going to make

15:43.710 --> 15:45.209
a scrapbook of the
trip for you guys.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.577
Let me see that.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.780
This is the area code
for Juarez, Mexico.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.448
He's trying to get
over the border!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.317
You think so?
Definitely.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.952
There's only one road
into Juarez,

15:53.954 --> 15:55.553
and it goes
through El Paso.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.055
We got to get
to El Paso.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.556
Joe, how do you know

15:58.558 --> 16:00.224
the area code for
Juarez, Mexico?

16:00.226 --> 16:03.261
There was a stem cell doctor
I went down there to see.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.331
He just rubbed, like,
salsa on my legs.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.069
Hey, you're not
in uniform.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.004
Are you guys cops?

16:13.006 --> 16:14.739
Are you guys cops?

16:14.741 --> 16:16.341
They know we're not cops!

16:16.343 --> 16:17.408
(tires squealing)

16:22.781 --> 16:24.082
All right, guys,
the next flight

16:24.084 --> 16:25.650
to El Paso leaves
in 40 minutes.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.018
But Briggs is ahead of us.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.252
Won't he already be there?

16:28.254 --> 16:30.288
No, he'd never risk
going through an airport.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.689
Too many cops,
too many cameras,

16:31.691 --> 16:32.757
too much security.

16:32.759 --> 16:33.992
I don't know, Joe.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.660
Sometimes the
security's pretty lax.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.929
I mean, the last plane
I was on got gay-jacked.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.631
This plane's going to Miami!

16:40.633 --> 16:42.100
(passengers gasp)

16:42.102 --> 16:44.235
(electronic dance music playing)

16:52.444 --> 16:53.611
Hey, Lois?

16:53.613 --> 16:55.279
Shh. Quiet, Brian.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.981
Mom's taking a nap
on the couch.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.816
Yeah. And look,
she fell asleep

16:58.818 --> 17:01.185
with the cat right
on her chest.

17:09.495 --> 17:11.529
Isn't that cute?

17:12.898 --> 17:14.966
(purring)

17:24.209 --> 17:25.476
Meow.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.478
Purr. Purr.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
I think you're dreaming.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.783
No, I'm not.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.323
BRIAN:
Stupid cat!

17:42.761 --> 17:44.429
God, it's so damn hot.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.730
Hey, I got an idea.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.266
Let's make
scalding asphalt angels.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.535
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

17:50.537 --> 17:51.869
(sizzling)

17:51.871 --> 17:54.839
Second-degree burns;
first-degree fun.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.075
Geez, how long we got to
stand out here like this?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.242
Till Briggs comes through.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.877
You know, I was thinking
about that, Joe.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.380
If Briggs is driving here,
that's like 2,000 miles.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.449
It's going to be at
least a couple of days.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.217
Huh. I guess you're right.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.953
Well, what are we going to do
for two days in El Paso?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.223
There's a Chicano
heritage festival.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.291
No way.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.059
KC and the Sunshine Band
is playing.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.260
Why?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.595
Or we could visit
the Pershing House

18:17.597 --> 18:19.230
where John Pershing
took control

18:19.232 --> 18:21.766
of the Eighth Army
Brigade in 1914.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.235
So, that's his bed?
Yes.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.536
So, that's his desk?
Yes.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.038
So, that's his lamp?
Yes.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.272
So, that's his dresser?
Yes.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.907
So, that's his window?
Yes.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.309
So, that's his floor?
Yes.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.044
Wow.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.449
What do you got
there, Quagmire?

18:38.451 --> 18:39.750
Is that Briggs?

18:39.752 --> 18:40.985
No, this guy's clean.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.753
Well, send him through.
What's the holdup?

18:42.755 --> 18:44.222
Sombreros! Maracas!

18:44.224 --> 18:46.224
Ceramic Winnie the Pooh dolls!

18:46.226 --> 18:47.492
Get 'em now, folks!

18:47.494 --> 18:49.627
You're not going to find
this stuff in Mexico!

18:50.596 --> 18:52.997
Come on. What's
going on up there?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.866
Briggs.

18:58.237 --> 19:00.538
Damn it!
He's getting away!

19:22.461 --> 19:24.428
(grunts)

19:27.266 --> 19:30.001
You're not going to get away
this time, you son of a bitch.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.435
Please, don't kill me.

19:31.437 --> 19:32.503
I'm not married.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.005
My life is awesome.

19:34.007 --> 19:37.041
I've waited 15 years
for this moment, Briggs.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.043
Do you have any idea
what it's like

19:39.045 --> 19:42.013
to have to lift yourself
into a wheelchair every morning?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.549
To have your wife look at you
like you're half a man?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.450
To get preferential parking?

19:46.452 --> 19:48.352
To board a plane early
with the first-class people

19:48.354 --> 19:49.987
and gold card members?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.656
All right, it's not all bad.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.524
But I'm not going to kill you.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.127
I'm not an animal like you.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.895
So, what are you going to do,
arrest me?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.030
No.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.965
I don't arrest cripples.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.501
(groaning)

20:03.503 --> 20:05.403
By the way, you're under arrest.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.838
I only said that last thing
'cause it seemed cool.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.574
Oh, my God,
that was so awesome.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.975
I saw everything.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.476
You were all like...
(deep mumbling)

20:12.478 --> 20:14.145
And Briggs was all like...
(high-pitched mumbling)

20:14.147 --> 20:15.913
And then you were all like...
(mimics two gunshots)

20:15.915 --> 20:17.481
And then Briggs's legs
were like...

20:17.483 --> 20:19.250
(mimics video game
sound effects)

20:19.252 --> 20:20.518
Oh, crap, he's dead.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.019
I think he bled out.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.721
I must have hit
the femoral artery.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.123
Ah, just kick him into Mexico.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.763
Guys, I can't thank you
enough for what you did.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.332
You risked your
lives for me,

20:34.334 --> 20:36.234
and I couldn't have
done it without you.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.835
Hey, that's what
pals are for.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.170
Yeah, and thanks for letting me

20:39.172 --> 20:40.771
fire a few rounds
into Briggs's corpse.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.774
That was the most powerful
I've felt in a couple years.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.042
Well, you guys helped me

20:45.044 --> 20:46.510
finally have some closure
in my life.

20:46.512 --> 20:49.747
I feel like a new man--
like I'm reborn.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.849
Joe, you have blood just
pouring out of your pant leg.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.985
Yeah, I had a ball
blow in the river.
