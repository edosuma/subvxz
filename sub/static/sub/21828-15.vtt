WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4 ...

00:05.083 --> 00:07.542
(Harper) We work together
until we defeat Traeger.

00:07.625 --> 00:09.041
We destroyed Traeger! It's over!

00:09.125 --> 00:11.959
(Harper) So it's time for me
to say, sayonara.

00:13.625 --> 00:14.917
Oooh!

00:28.959 --> 00:33.125
Ohh! My fiefdom is fief-dope!

00:33.208 --> 00:34.250
-Mmm!
-Uggh!

00:34.333 --> 00:35.542
Ugghhh!

00:35.625 --> 00:38.792
-Easy, dude. Still feelin' a little--
-Stupid? For wearing that hat?

00:38.875 --> 00:41.166
-(others laugh)
-Ha.

00:41.250 --> 00:44.875
No, I like this hat, it's just,
still feelin' a little... barfy.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.959
Really? 'Cause I feel great.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.875
Mm, defeat Traeger, check.

00:48.959 --> 00:51.500
Defeat all of you
at this game? In progress.

00:51.583 --> 00:53.458
(chuckling) Not so fast, kid, okay?

00:53.542 --> 00:55.291
I've been playing
this game so long,

00:55.375 --> 00:57.333
I have moves
they haven't even invented yet.

00:57.417 --> 00:59.750
Surprising confidence
when Ryan's kicking your butt.

00:59.834 --> 01:01.291
-Yeah.
-That's a first.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.000
Usually Ryan eats it
at this game.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.417
We never get past the first round,
all we do is hassle him.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.625
How is this any different?

01:06.709 --> 01:09.875
We're celebrating Traeger's loss,
instead of playing a game Ryan loses.

01:09.959 --> 01:12.083
-(chuckles)
-Mmm, not this time,

01:12.166 --> 01:15.500
Boom! "Trance"!
(emphatically) Skip your turn!

01:15.583 --> 01:17.750
-(laughs) Oh, yeah! Yeah! Back away!
-Wow.

01:17.834 --> 01:19.500
-Uggghhh!
-Ooh.

01:19.583 --> 01:22.375
Food poisoning. Happens
when you keep fish sticks in your locker.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.000
Didn't Veracity throw those away?

01:24.083 --> 01:25.750
-Not all of 'em!
-Oh.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.750
Hey, where is Veracity, anyway?

01:27.834 --> 01:29.375
She was supposed
to teach me gram-o-grams.

01:29.458 --> 01:33.375
Have you guys heard
of this thing called "memes"?

01:35.625 --> 01:36.583
You've all heard of it.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.250
-Yes.
-A little bit, but that's okay.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.750
-Hm. Okay.
-Veracity's touring a school

01:40.834 --> 01:43.542
that's for geniuses
that has never invited Harris.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.458
Because it's an all-girls' school.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.125
My petition is working its way through
the court system.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.583
-You've retained a lawyer?
-Yes.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.250
(Spyder) Yep, of course you did.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.458
-Come on, Mark!
-(Ryan) Any time, Mark.

01:54.542 --> 01:56.291
-Come on, Mark, it's your turn!
-(ticking)

01:56.375 --> 01:58.417
-Whoa. Okay.
-I'm on a roll.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.208
-(ominous music plays)
-(ticking continues)

02:06.583 --> 02:09.875
(theme music playing)

02:41.583 --> 02:44.000
(ticking continues)

02:44.083 --> 02:45.750
It's gonna be a chilla.

02:45.834 --> 02:51.166
And a thrilla, and quite a killa,
when I burn down your vill...

02:52.583 --> 02:54.208
...age. Village.

02:54.291 --> 02:55.625
(clicking)

02:55.709 --> 02:57.667
What's that ticking sound?

02:57.750 --> 03:01.041
(ticking and clicking continue)

03:05.750 --> 03:07.041
(clicking tongue)

03:08.500 --> 03:10.125
Ah, it's me.
I'm making the ticking sound.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.667
When I think, I'm concentrating,
I make sounds with my mouth.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.500
-Like, ma ma ma ma--
-Stop that.

03:14.583 --> 03:15.625
Hm. Okay.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.834
Uh-huh, yeah!

03:18.917 --> 03:21.041
Who's been playing this game
since before I was born now?

03:21.125 --> 03:24.375
It's still me.
Ryan, that's not how time works.

03:24.458 --> 03:25.583
Well, yeah.

03:25.667 --> 03:29.125
Oh, but also, I have a little surprise
for everyone. "Steal"!

03:29.208 --> 03:30.375
No, you can't do that!

03:30.458 --> 03:31.834
Oh, yes, I can!

03:31.917 --> 03:34.542
Oh, and, uh, speaking of "can,"
if anyone needs me...

03:34.625 --> 03:35.750
-(hits table)
-(sloshes)

03:35.834 --> 03:37.792
...I'll be in the left ankle.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.208
Do not disturb.

03:40.417 --> 03:42.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hold on, the left--

03:42.375 --> 03:45.542
the left ankle... is the bathroom?

03:45.625 --> 03:47.875
-Yeah.
-So, nobody go in the right ankle.

03:47.959 --> 03:49.625
-Dude.
-(Harris) Ohhh...

03:49.709 --> 03:50.583
Uh.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.375
Ahh, okay...

03:56.792 --> 03:58.792
Huh. Where's the elevator?

03:58.875 --> 04:00.125
Oh, yeah, right,

04:00.208 --> 04:02.208
I took 'em offline when I was
doing the upgrades.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.166
Anyhoo--

04:06.583 --> 04:09.667
-Ughhh!
-Dude, are you sure you're okay?

04:09.750 --> 04:10.917
Yeah, no, I'm-- I'm fine,

04:11.041 --> 04:14.291
I'm just-- just working
the fish sticks through.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.875
-Uuggh!
-That's disgusting.

04:15.959 --> 04:18.542
-Ugghh! I regret nothing!
-(ticking)

04:18.625 --> 04:19.750
Ughhh!

04:27.583 --> 04:32.125
Okay, so, guys, would food poisoning
cause me to s-- like, see things,

04:32.208 --> 04:35.667
like some sort
of cool but scary bomb under the table?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.291
Spyder, you're seeing things.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.083
You don't look good.
You should lie down.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.583
No!
Just look under the table!

04:42.667 --> 04:43.542
Bomb!

04:43.625 --> 04:45.375
Ryan, you can stop it, right?

04:45.458 --> 04:46.625
Uh--

04:46.709 --> 04:48.166
I'm trying, but nothing's working!

04:48.250 --> 04:49.542
No electric components.

04:49.625 --> 04:51.417
Hmm, maybe if we
turn the timer to zero--

04:51.500 --> 04:53.417
-(trio) No!
-Okay.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.500
Oh, uh...

04:57.583 --> 05:00.250
Harris, give me my drill
from my toolbox. The small one!

05:00.333 --> 05:02.291
Uh, Spyder, go to the left ankle

05:02.375 --> 05:04.583
and pull a torken fetter
from the access panel.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.000
I don't know what that is,
but I will pull everything.

05:09.959 --> 05:11.792
Torken fetter, torken fetter,
where are you?

05:13.875 --> 05:15.250
Pull... a...

05:15.333 --> 05:17.166
There's no such thing
as a torken fetter.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.875
I've seen Spyder drop
several explosives.

05:19.959 --> 05:21.458
And we're done rolling dice now.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.583
(grunts) Okay.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.750
-(both scream)
-Wow, thanks for checkin' up on me.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.208
But I wanna let you know I'm a big boy,
and I can go all on my own.

05:30.291 --> 05:32.500
I need a torken fetter,
there's an explosive in the X-deck,

05:32.583 --> 05:34.208
Mark needs a torken fetter to disable it.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.125
-Explosive?
-Yep.

05:35.208 --> 05:36.834
-Torken fetter.
-Yeah?

05:38.375 --> 05:40.375
There's no such thing
as a torken fetter.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.500
-Yes, there is.
-No.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.000
Here you go.

05:48.834 --> 05:51.083
-Oh-- No...
-It's speeding up.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.959
-I can't jam it.
-Ugh...

05:53.041 --> 05:55.917
-One minute left!
-Um, I can't find the torken fetter,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.166
and also, Leo says it doesn't exist!

05:58.250 --> 06:00.250
(Leo) It doesn't, listen closely:

06:00.875 --> 06:04.083
Cut the blue wire,
it's always the blue wire.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.709
There aren't any wires!

06:05.792 --> 06:08.041
Umm... cut the red wire?

06:08.125 --> 06:09.542
It's just gears.

06:10.291 --> 06:11.792
Maybe we can...

06:11.875 --> 06:15.166
freeze it with the coolant
from the power system!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.792
I'm on it!

06:17.792 --> 06:18.834
Come on!

06:27.041 --> 06:28.917
Are-- Are-- Are you sure
there isn't a red wire?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.875
Look closely,
please-- please, look closely.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.000
Come on!

06:36.041 --> 06:37.875
-Do it, come on!
-Okay.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.709
(both laughing)

06:48.792 --> 06:50.291
-Yes!
-Oh my gosh!

06:51.125 --> 06:54.000
Hey, uh, uh, I would've heard if you guys
had blown up by now, right?

06:54.083 --> 06:54.959
Right?

06:55.041 --> 06:56.417
-Let's go! Yeah.
-Let's go!

06:58.083 --> 07:00.667
Who could've done this?
Okay-- It has to be Harper.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.250
It can't be.
The bomb used an egg timer,

07:02.333 --> 07:03.959
it had to have been
placed in the last hour.

07:04.041 --> 07:05.458
Harper ghosted days ago.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.458
-Grey?
-Impossible.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.208
Mark and I
built a security system

07:09.291 --> 07:11.000
specifically designed
to keep her out

07:11.083 --> 07:13.166
while you saved Ryan's bio-dad
from the mine collapse

07:13.250 --> 07:14.458
before the city-wide blackout.

07:14.542 --> 07:15.959
Man, that was a crazy 24 hours!

07:16.041 --> 07:18.875
We have to check the security footage,
see if anybody got in.

07:18.959 --> 07:20.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

07:21.166 --> 07:23.333
There are cameras in this robot?

07:23.417 --> 07:24.625
Spyder, it is okay.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.291
We know you sleep here
four days a week.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.291
Look, the time code jumps
from 6:09 to 6:42.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.125
The last half hour of footage
was wiped.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.792
But just on the interior cameras.

07:35.875 --> 07:39.000
The exterior cameras
didn't show anything, which means...

07:39.083 --> 07:40.125
no one came in or out.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.291
So what you're saying is
it's one of us?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.333
One of us planted the bomb?

07:49.750 --> 07:52.000
And no one moves
till we find out who.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.125
Are you insane? You think one of us
planted the explosive?

07:57.208 --> 07:58.458
There's no other explanation.

07:58.542 --> 07:59.875
No one came in or out.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.709
That doesn't make any sense.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.166
We were all in the robot.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.709
It could've taken any of us out.

08:05.667 --> 08:08.291
Guys, we've done some crazy things.
I went nuts in the Arctic.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.667
Harris turned into a monster.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.375
Harper gave Ryan's mom
a mind-controlling brain bug.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.959
Couldn't he have done that
to any of us?

08:16.458 --> 08:19.083
I mean... am I even in control?

08:21.792 --> 08:23.709
-(splashes)
-Bro!

08:25.041 --> 08:26.291
I think so.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.000
That's my juice.

08:28.083 --> 08:29.542
I gotta get another one.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.208
And the fridge
is all the way over there.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.166
Hey! One of us did this,

08:33.250 --> 08:36.041
we need to stay together
until we figure out what's going on!

08:36.125 --> 08:38.792
Okay, you guys?
We just need to, uh, take a deep breath.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.125
Think of things that'll calm us down.

08:41.667 --> 08:42.917
Sophomore year, uh...

08:43.542 --> 08:47.208
spring playoffs...
Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark...

08:48.041 --> 08:49.417
Whoo!

08:50.000 --> 08:52.959
Wow. Nice job lifting
all of our spirits, Mark.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.041
What are you doing
to figure this out?

08:55.125 --> 08:56.166
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

08:56.250 --> 08:58.458
we can't turn on each other.
We're a team.

08:58.542 --> 09:00.792
He's right. We need to go over
exactly where we were,

09:00.875 --> 09:03.375
right before the game,
during the deleted security footage.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.917
If one of us did that, wouldn't they
lie about where they were?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.792
Yeah, and when we find
the hole in their story,

09:07.875 --> 09:09.750
we'll know who tried to kill us.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.500
I'll go first.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.083
This afternoon,
I was in my workshop,

09:15.166 --> 09:17.750
working on a sick engine rebuild.

09:17.834 --> 09:23.083
(dance music playing)

09:23.166 --> 09:24.333
I look good in my memory.

09:34.417 --> 09:37.250
Sup, Georgia. See you tomorrow.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.583
-I saw Ryan, too.
-Oh, yeah, I remember that.

09:39.667 --> 09:43.000
When I grow up... I wanna be you.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.750
-What?
-I don't know exactly what you said.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.542
(both) Walker brothers!

09:55.625 --> 09:58.041
Did you do... anything else?

09:58.125 --> 10:00.500
Uh, I needed a tool,
so I headed over to Leo's.

10:00.583 --> 10:01.583
He'll back me up.

10:02.625 --> 10:03.834
Here's that tool you wanted.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.667
Thanks, dude.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.041
(whispers) Was it a torken fetter?

10:10.125 --> 10:14.166
(sighs) When I grow up, I wanna be
you, Mark Walker.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.834
Someday.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.542
Okay. I think we get it.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.208
Mark borrowed a tool from Leo

10:19.291 --> 10:21.667
and has a disturbing amount
of self-esteem.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.375
So, Leo, you back up Mark's story?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.583
At least the parts
he wasn't embellishing?

10:26.667 --> 10:29.959
Yes, but there are two problems
with Mark's story!

10:30.041 --> 10:33.542
One, when I grow up,
I wanna be Tina Fey.

10:35.041 --> 10:38.208
And two, the tool
you borrowed from me

10:38.291 --> 10:39.959
wasn't a wrench.

10:40.041 --> 10:43.041
It wasn't even a tool
you'd use on an engine at all.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.083
Well, what was it?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.041
A needle.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.875
Used for boring small holes.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.000
Here's that tool you wanted.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.834
Small holes, like at the center
of the gears in the device?

10:58.917 --> 11:01.625
No no no no, no!
You guys, I promise, I would never--

11:01.709 --> 11:04.208
Mark, hey!
Just-- Just show us the engine.

11:04.291 --> 11:07.000
You're my brother,
I know you wouldn't do this.

11:10.291 --> 11:11.333
No.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.500
-Mmmmm...
-What is this?

11:21.583 --> 11:25.000
-Just leave it alone, it's nothing--
-It's an embroidery station.

11:27.125 --> 11:27.959
What a...

11:29.041 --> 11:29.875
relief?

11:29.959 --> 11:30.792
(laughs)

11:30.875 --> 11:32.417
I didn't want you
to find out this way.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.917
Or... at all.

11:34.542 --> 11:36.834
Georgia got me
into embroidery for cosplay,

11:36.917 --> 11:38.625
and we do it
while we watch basketball.

11:38.709 --> 11:41.250
It's-- It's romantic. It's romantic!

11:41.333 --> 11:42.417
Oh?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.917
This is intricate.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.291
Thanks?

11:45.375 --> 11:48.750
What a tight stitch, uh--
this took a long time.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.166
And it's still warm.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.917
Which means that Mark
must've worked on this

11:54.000 --> 11:58.333
before the game, it--
it's not him. He's innocent.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.291
Let's get outta here
and never speak of this again.

12:00.375 --> 12:01.291
Oh, yeah, man, for sure.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.041
-Just let me get a couple of pictures.
-What?

12:03.125 --> 12:05.250
Do you like
portrait or landscape?

12:05.333 --> 12:07.792
I don't have some
awesome sewing secret,

12:07.875 --> 12:11.375
but I was totally busy not building
some crazy explodey thing.

12:11.458 --> 12:14.792
I was in the medbay,
doing some light math as usual,

12:14.875 --> 12:16.750
in an attempt to cure
my food poisoning.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.083
(stomach gurgling)

12:22.417 --> 12:24.667
Ha! Ten!

12:25.667 --> 12:28.333
The equation! The cure!

12:28.417 --> 12:29.458
Harris!

12:30.709 --> 12:31.959
Don't you know
what this means?

12:32.041 --> 12:34.959
Wow! You're amazing!

12:35.041 --> 12:37.417
Just like the real Alfred Eimstein.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.375
I know.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.333
-Um, I don't--
-Mark got make stuff up,

12:40.417 --> 12:42.709
-so let's just let him have this.
-Okay.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.709
(Spyder) And then, four Harrises
did a line dance.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.542
Spyder, that was a fever dream.

12:52.625 --> 12:54.583
I took care of you
in the medbay while you slept.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.583
Until you woke up,
and threw up on my sneakers.

12:56.667 --> 12:59.583
(laughs) Oh, yeah! I remember that.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.709
So the only person
who could vouch for you was asleep.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.792
Yeah, but I was
in the medbay the whole time.

13:03.875 --> 13:05.583
Spyder saw me before
and after he fell asleep.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.333
Ryan, you saw me, too!

13:08.417 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, I know, but you still
had enough time

13:10.083 --> 13:12.208
to jump in the elevator
and then plant the explosive.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.625
Except... I cut the power
to the elevators

13:14.709 --> 13:15.792
when I was doing the upgrade.

13:15.875 --> 13:19.041
So it was literally impossible for Harris
to do all that in such a short time.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.917
Leo's right. I couldn't even move
that fast, and I'm...

13:22.000 --> 13:23.583
-you know, awesome.
-Yeah.

13:23.667 --> 13:26.375
Bam! Innocence is sweet!

13:26.458 --> 13:30.750
I mean... Ryan? What about you?

13:30.834 --> 13:33.083
Are you sure your Traeger freak-out
didn't come back?

13:33.834 --> 13:35.542
What? No...

13:36.250 --> 13:37.667
Uh-- No, it wasn't me!

13:37.750 --> 13:40.583
Because I know exactly what I was doing
before we played the game.

13:44.291 --> 13:47.250
Uh, I w-- I wanted to do
some training exercises

13:47.333 --> 13:48.417
before we played.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.667
I-- I saw Mark in the hallway.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.959
Sup, Georgia? See you tomorrow.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.291
"See you later, Merek the Muscly"?
Heart emoji? Ugh!

13:57.375 --> 13:58.792
You read my text? Not cool.

13:59.417 --> 14:02.667
After I passed Casa-no-game,
I went to train in the control center.

14:03.417 --> 14:04.917
Hooked up to the control pad?

14:06.000 --> 14:06.834
Yeah.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.583
No, you didn't.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.417
When I cut the power
to the elevator,

14:13.500 --> 14:15.542
it also cut the power
to the control pad,

14:15.625 --> 14:18.083
so that... is impossible.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.291
Ryan?

14:26.834 --> 14:27.959
Anything you wanna tell us?

14:29.083 --> 14:29.917
Yes.

14:32.959 --> 14:33.959
I lied.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.417
(both sigh)

14:37.709 --> 14:38.792
(pukes)

14:43.667 --> 14:44.625
You were lying?

14:46.333 --> 14:47.208
Good as new.

14:47.291 --> 14:48.750
What are you saying?
You planted it?

14:48.834 --> 14:51.125
No-- No-- I-- I wasn't lying about--

14:51.208 --> 14:53.291
about the-- the explosive,
I was lying because...

14:54.458 --> 14:55.750
because I cheated in the game.

14:55.834 --> 14:56.875
I knew it!

14:57.792 --> 14:59.458
I mean... wait-- what?

14:59.542 --> 15:00.959
How?

15:01.041 --> 15:03.125
You know, Ryan? I'm proud of you.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.709
For defeating Traeger?

15:04.792 --> 15:07.208
(laughs) No, no, no,
for playing this game again.

15:07.291 --> 15:11.375
I mean, you always lose!
In ridiculous fashion!

15:11.458 --> 15:13.458
It's... uncanny.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.291
But-- But yeah, yeah,
that-- that Traeger thing,

15:16.375 --> 15:17.709
that was-- that was cool, too.

15:17.792 --> 15:22.375
I was tired of losing,
and-- and all the trash talking.

15:23.125 --> 15:25.750
So... I teched out the dice.

15:25.834 --> 15:27.500
(snoring)

15:36.375 --> 15:37.208
(snoring)

15:40.291 --> 15:42.041
-Checking on Spyder?
-Aah!

15:42.125 --> 15:45.875
Huh, yep, yep, and everything
looks... good. (laughs)

15:45.959 --> 15:48.291
Uh, well, yeah,
so I'll see you later,

15:48.375 --> 15:49.500
and I love you, bye!

15:52.083 --> 15:53.375
"Love you, bye"?

16:00.917 --> 16:02.083
(laughs) Yeah!

16:02.166 --> 16:04.500
Who's been playin' this game
since before I was born now?

16:07.625 --> 16:08.458
Ryan?

16:09.750 --> 16:12.542
Such a noble leader,
but it also turns out

16:12.625 --> 16:14.709
you are just--
and I hate to go there--

16:15.500 --> 16:17.583
a cheater, cheater,
pumpkin eater.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.041
And the worst one in the patch!

16:19.125 --> 16:20.625
I-- I just wanted to win.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.667
I'm sorry.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.667
Hey...

16:25.375 --> 16:26.667
I'm proud of you.

16:27.458 --> 16:31.000
And also relieved...
you were not tryin' to blow us all up.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.792
Okay, well, that's everybody...

16:33.500 --> 16:34.583
except Leo.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.750
Wait, what?

16:37.834 --> 16:38.834
Me?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.625
Why would I-- I--

16:41.709 --> 16:44.667
I would never blow up
my own robot!

16:46.875 --> 16:49.542
Or you guys--
or you guys in it, as well.

16:49.625 --> 16:53.417
Come on, I was in the workshop
the entire time, remember?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.208
Doing upgrades!

16:55.291 --> 16:57.125
Upgrades!

16:58.417 --> 16:59.750
Do you have any proof?

16:59.834 --> 17:02.166
Well, it's no embroidery station,

17:02.250 --> 17:05.250
but I did install
a neck massager on my chair,

17:05.333 --> 17:07.000
and the paint should still be wet.

17:07.083 --> 17:10.375
And I painted it... red.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.250
Yeah.

17:13.125 --> 17:16.500
Okay, welcome to Casa de Leo!

17:16.583 --> 17:18.667
Don't go in my bedroom!
Haven't made my bed.

17:18.750 --> 17:22.667
Ha-ha-ha! Here she is!
Yeah, lookin' good.

17:23.625 --> 17:27.083
Whoo! The, uh, paint fumes
on that are a little bit toxic,

17:27.166 --> 17:28.458
so you might wanna
hold your breath.

17:28.542 --> 17:30.291
(gasping)

17:32.458 --> 17:35.667
Don't have to hold it that much,
it's a bit comical, a bit much.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.250
It was you.

17:40.375 --> 17:43.291
Wh-- I-- I didn't put those there!

17:43.375 --> 17:44.625
Everything is here!

17:44.709 --> 17:47.333
Everything you would need
to build that explosive!

17:48.750 --> 17:50.959
Including this poster-sized
schematic of the thing

17:51.041 --> 17:52.166
that almost blew us up!

17:53.291 --> 17:55.792
Now you're-- Now you're--
Now you're closing in on me?

17:55.875 --> 17:57.458
This is actually happening?

17:58.250 --> 18:01.750
Leo? We're your friends.
We can help you.

18:01.834 --> 18:03.250
Wait a second.
Give me a second, okay?

18:03.333 --> 18:06.166
I don't think straight
when I'm surrounded!

18:06.250 --> 18:07.917
Guys, give him some space.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.458
We can't give him space,
Spyder, he tried to blow us up.

18:10.542 --> 18:11.750
Did you plant any other ones?

18:11.834 --> 18:13.709
No! I didn't!

18:13.792 --> 18:16.875
I've been in here all day
doing, you know...

18:16.959 --> 18:18.417
crazy invention stuff!

18:18.500 --> 18:20.583
B-- B-- But, uh,
good invention stuff,

18:20.667 --> 18:21.959
not evil invention stuff.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.166
Leo, come clean.

18:23.250 --> 18:25.291
Th-- There must be something
you're not telling us.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.000
I am keeping something from you.

18:29.417 --> 18:32.000
Bovine! Cherry! Sandal!

18:35.083 --> 18:36.875
(Leo laughing evilly)

18:36.959 --> 18:39.625
We can still catch him.
He's old, he can't run that fast.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.917
Leo! Leo!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.208
You guys really think Leo did this?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.333
He left the X-deck
right before we found the device.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.166
There's explosives in his workshop
and... he's on the run.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.125
-You're right.
-Can you find him in the cameras?

18:53.250 --> 18:55.583
He's heading towards
the control center, come on!

18:58.291 --> 18:59.917
(Ryan) Hey, Leo, surrender!

19:00.000 --> 19:01.875
Come on, help us figure this out!

19:01.959 --> 19:03.750
I'm gettin' outta here
till you guys cool off.

19:03.834 --> 19:05.542
We're not letting you go.
You can't leave!

19:05.625 --> 19:08.125
All right, fine. Have it your way.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.417
Cunningham!
Peppermint! Tapenade!

19:15.000 --> 19:16.417
There's no tech
in the weapons.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.500
You made weapons
specifically to use against me?

19:20.583 --> 19:22.959
Ryan, you went nuts
in the Arctic!

19:23.041 --> 19:24.542
I like to be prepared for anything.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.709
Leo, don't!

19:30.959 --> 19:31.875
Uhh!

19:33.041 --> 19:33.917
Huh!

19:47.417 --> 19:48.375
Ahhh!

19:51.583 --> 19:53.208
I'm disappointed in you guys.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.875
Especially in you, Ryan.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.250
I protected you
when you were a baby.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.750
I never gave you up
when Harper had me in prison.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.792
And now you turn on me?

20:05.041 --> 20:06.458
Thunderdump!

20:06.542 --> 20:07.959
-Whoa!
-Come on!

20:08.041 --> 20:09.333
-Guys?
-Leo! No!

20:09.417 --> 20:10.291
Whoa!

20:13.583 --> 20:14.667
Not again!

20:14.750 --> 20:16.291
Leo! Stop! Come back!

20:18.166 --> 20:20.500
-I can't move!
-I can't move!

20:20.583 --> 20:22.291
(Harris) I can't move! I'm tied up!

20:22.375 --> 20:23.750
(grunts)

20:24.750 --> 20:26.208
(Ryan) Stupid Thunderdump!

20:26.291 --> 20:31.333
I have the most terrible
Thunderdump joke,

20:32.041 --> 20:35.041
but I don't--
I don't think it's appropriate.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.792
But it's good, trust me.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.709
I should've known
something was off about Leo.

20:45.333 --> 20:48.375
How could I let
a stupid board game distract me?

20:48.458 --> 20:49.709
Don't blame yourself.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.166
None of us saw it coming.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.542
He was locked up
by himself for years.

20:53.625 --> 20:56.083
And we were working
with the guy that did that to him.

20:56.959 --> 20:59.166
I guess that could
drive anybody crazy.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.291
-Poor guy.
-But hey...

21:02.834 --> 21:04.125
you still have your friends.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.542
And the giant robot.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.458
Not too shabby.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.000
Thanks, man.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.291
Uhhh...

21:24.083 --> 21:25.750
(Traeger's voice) You failed me.

21:25.834 --> 21:28.625
Your bomb destroyed no one.

21:28.709 --> 21:33.125
But I was able
to drive away the inventor.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.625
(Traeger's voice) Do better.

21:34.709 --> 21:37.959
Next time make sure
you destroy the technopath.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.333
Absolutely.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.959
Hey, I just realized
it's taco night at Nessa's.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.333
Taco time, son! Let's bounce!

22:03.333 --> 22:08.166
(theme music playing)
