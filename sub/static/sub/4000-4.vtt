56:07.041 --> 56:10.792
THAT'S NOT ME, EITHER.

56:10.792 --> 56:12.542
MY NEW FRIEND THOUGHT

56:12.542 --> 56:16.208
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RESIST
THE KILL HE LEFT FOR ME,

56:16.208 --> 56:18.333
BUT I DID.

56:26.500 --> 56:30.709
I'M NOT THE MONSTER
HE WANTS ME TO BE.

56:30.709 --> 56:33.291
SO I'M NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST.

56:33.291 --> 56:36.875
I'M SOMETHING NEW ENTIRELY,

56:36.875 --> 56:40.500
WITH MY OWN SET OF RULES.

56:47.959 --> 56:49.667
I'M DEXTER.

56:49.667 --> 56:50.792
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]

56:50.792 --> 56:52.500
BOO.

56:52.500 --> 56:55.417
