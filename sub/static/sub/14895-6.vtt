[announcer 1] <i>And EMCC is up 48-nothing.</i>

00:12.053 --> 00:13.930
<i>DJ Law was looking up field.</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:15.765
<i>That's gotta be</i>
<i>a targeting penalty and it is.</i>

00:15.849 --> 00:19.227
<i>And then Law's gonna get up</i>

00:19.310 --> 00:20.895
[indistinct yelling]

00:20.979 --> 00:23.022
[Buddy] No, no, no. Hey, hey!

00:35.577 --> 00:36.578
Get back, get back, get back.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.829
DJ Law, Coach!

00:37.912 --> 00:39.956
They got him over there!
They stomping him, man!

00:40.040 --> 00:41.124
They stomping him, Coach!

00:41.207 --> 00:42.500
Get back. Get back. Hey!

00:42.584 --> 00:44.794
[announcer 1] <i>This is out of control.</i>
[announcer 2] <i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

00:49.924 --> 00:52.218
<i>This is totally out of control.</i>

Hey! Get back.
Hey! Get back!

00:56.097 --> 00:57.474
[announcer 2] <i>Total frustration.</i>

00:57.557 --> 00:59.392
[announcer 3] <i>They have to get</i>

00:59.476 --> 01:02.562
[announcer 2] <i>Players throwing</i>

01:02.687 --> 01:04.772
-[whistle blowing]
-[player] Punch that nigga, man!

01:04.855 --> 01:07.650
Like I can't punch that nigga!
Punch that nigga!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.403
[announcer 2] <i>This is ugly, folks.</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:12.155
<i>This is just downright ugly.</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:14.908
<i>And they have security out there</i>
<i>that's doing absolutely nothing.</i>

01:14.991 --> 01:16.910
<i>They may have to call this game.</i>

01:17.619 --> 01:20.914
No, no, bullshit!
Fuck all that bullshit, man!

01:20.997 --> 01:23.291
That nigga won't do shit!
On my mama!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.256
[Buddy] <i>Yo, get back. Get back.</i>

01:30.340 --> 01:33.218
Hey, shut the fuck up.
Don't talk to my guys. Shut the fuck up.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.220
You shut the--
Come get my ass, then, damn it!

01:35.303 --> 01:37.472
I'll beat your bitch ass!

01:37.555 --> 01:38.890
Promise you that.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.850
Get back, man. Chill.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.395
-I'll tell you what!
-That's my coach!

01:44.479 --> 01:46.231
Well, get his fucking hands off of me!

01:47.190 --> 01:49.150
Don't put your fucking hands
on my coach, man!

01:49.234 --> 01:50.777
Damn these motherfuckers!

01:50.860 --> 01:53.238
Shut the fuck up and get on the side!

01:53.321 --> 01:56.491
Shut the fuck up and get on the side!

01:56.574 --> 01:59.202
[announcer 2] <i>We may finally have</i>
<i>some control.</i>

01:59.285 --> 02:01.037
<i>DJ Law's jersey's been ripped.</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:03.373
<i>He was by himself and he had</i>
<i>three guys swinging at him.</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:05.708
[Buddy] Get the fuck over there!

02:05.792 --> 02:07.961
Get your ass over here, too!

02:08.044 --> 02:10.964
[announcer 2] <i>This is the kind of thing</i>
<i>that can hurt only one team.</i>

02:11.047 --> 02:13.007
<i>And that's the team</i>
<i>that has a chance to advance.</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:16.136
[announcer 1] <i>We're seeing this</i>
<i>because EMCC beats people so badly.</i>

02:16.219 --> 02:18.805
<i>Frustrations boil.</i>
<i>And that's what's happened in this game.</i>

02:18.888 --> 02:22.225
[Buddy] Shut up!
Get your ass in here. Now!

02:22.308 --> 02:24.394
Get your ass in here!

02:24.477 --> 02:26.604
Now let me tell you something,

02:26.688 --> 02:29.149
you just probably cost your chance
at a National Championship.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.277
'Cause they ain't gonna
let you play next week.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.653
Watch what happens!

02:33.736 --> 02:36.781
Because I got dumbasses
that can't damn listen.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.368
I told you before we started
what would happen.

02:40.451 --> 02:44.789
But you ain't got the pride
or the heart not to let it happen.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.666
-[indistinct shouting]
-Shut up! I don't give a damn!

02:47.167 --> 02:49.085
No, man! Fuck all that, man!

02:49.168 --> 02:51.629
-Bro, that's fucked up, bro!
-Hey, shut up!

02:51.713 --> 02:55.508
Hey, hey, hey! Shut up!

02:56.551 --> 03:00.179
I won't do it. I won't coach you
if that's what you got.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.725
Because all I saw was thug bullshit.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.146
We talked about having more pride,
but you didn't want to.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.690
You wanna be damn street thugs,
so I'll tell you what.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.526
Go find another damn school to go to.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.446
'Cause we ain't gonna be
damn street thugs.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.448
Now I'm telling you what's gonna happen.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.866
I'm fixin' to walk out there
and they're gonna say,

03:19.949 --> 03:22.827
"Hey, both teams
have to forfeit the game."

03:22.911 --> 03:25.580
That gives you a loss.
Or they're gonna go out there and say,

03:25.663 --> 03:29.125
"Hey, everybody that left the sidelines
can't play next week."

03:29.208 --> 03:31.920
And that will happen.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.547
Because we tried to tell you!
"No. Hell, no."

03:34.631 --> 03:36.382
"I'mma go take care of somebody."

03:36.466 --> 03:37.759
"I'mma go talk to somebody."

03:37.842 --> 03:40.220
"I'mma go help somebody."
Horseshit!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.097
I hope they tell us we can't play.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.975
Maybe it will be something that you,
by God, will listen to.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.854
And you ain't got nobody to blame
but the guy in the mirror.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.981
'Cause you didn't have to do that!

03:52.065 --> 03:53.566
None of you did!

03:53.650 --> 03:56.277
That's horseshit.
I won't be a damn part of it.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.947
Get me another damn job! Move.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.657
Hell, no. You gonna fight!

04:00.740 --> 04:02.617
Man, you just got suspended. Coach!

04:02.700 --> 04:04.869
You just got suspended.
What the fuck?

04:04.953 --> 04:07.830
[Wood] Listen to me. Hey! Hey!
Let's see what happens.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.749
Don't worry about that,
get your head right. Let's go.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.918
We gotta finish the game.
Let's go finish the game. Let's go.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.461
[player] What they want us to do, bro?

04:13.544 --> 04:16.047
What fucking kind of coach says that, bro?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.882
[Trickett] We good.
Don't turn on your goddamn coach.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.801
[Mario] I understand that.
[Trickett] What if we get a loss?

04:19.884 --> 04:21.094
We don't play
in the National Championship.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.846
That's the only fucking thing
that we came back for. So let's do that.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.307
It's a lose--
It's a lose-lose situation.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.434
Bro, ain't no way--
It ain't no way around it, bro.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.145
You taking the arrow regardless, bro.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.022
[Ollie] That just fucked up everything.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.400
That just fucked up
everything we had, bro.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.694
-It's over, bro. It's over.
-[player] Game over, huh.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.862
We ain't about to let them
get jumped, bro.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.614
Hell, no, bro! We family out here.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.285
Bro, I've been with y'all
for two years, bro!

04:47.036 --> 04:48.788
[stammers] I squared off with 92,
straight up.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.249
I took off with his ass.
Six of them came after me.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.584
I don't give a fuck
about none of that shit.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.796
[referee] You can only do so much
because we are talking about young men.

04:56.879 --> 05:00.258
And you knew, no matter what we did,
no matter how we handled it,

05:00.341 --> 05:02.969
somebody was gonna get out of hand
like it just did.

05:03.052 --> 05:06.639
We have 98 white,
99 white, 12 white.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.766
[Buddy] Ejections or...
or violent ejections?

05:08.850 --> 05:11.477
[referee] Oh, these are
fighting ejections. So that is violent.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.688
[Buddy] Okay.
[referee] Okay. All right. And again--

05:13.771 --> 05:15.481
[Buddy stuttering] Which totally
screws us.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.400
It's all right, though.
It's all right, though.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.152
[referee] All we can do
is try to get to the middle of it.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.405
[Buddy] Piece of shit.
[referee] Three, six, eighty-five...

05:22.488 --> 05:24.949
[Buddy] He knows it.
[referee] Three, Six... We get it, Coach.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.909
If we have one more comment,
we're just gonna leave this--

05:26.993 --> 05:28.369
[Buddy] Well, might as well
go ahead and leave it.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.663
[referee] All right, then we gonna leave.
We're gonna leave it.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.417
[Buddy] <i>Ninety-eight, stand up.</i>

05:35.543 --> 05:37.378
Ninety-nine, stand up.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.089
Twelve, stand up.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.135
Eleven, stand up.
One, stand up.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.222
Where's one? One, stand up.
Where's he at?

05:49.599 --> 05:50.892
[shouts] One!

05:50.975 --> 05:54.187
You guys decided to dance,
you guys gotta pay the fiddler.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.857
The guys that are standing up
will no longer play here.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.984
They have a two-game suspension
for the rest of the year.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.112
Ball game's over.
Go get dressed. Get on the bus.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.530
Let's go.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.076
Hey, ain't nobody gonna be mad
at nobody. Look in the mirror.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.744
[Trickett] Hey, D!
D, come in with me.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.954
Let him go. I got him.
He's coming in with me.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.623
-Let's go inside.
-Walk in with me. Walk in with me.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.209
-Walk in with me. Walk in with me.
-[DJ] I love you, boy.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.335
[Trickett] I got him.
You good?

06:17.418 --> 06:19.170
[Dario] Man, they taking
that shit from us, brother.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.963
-The refs ain't doing shit!
-I know. We good, we good.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.215
[John] <i>Bitch-ass niggas, man.</i>

06:22.298 --> 06:24.926
I can't play for no soft-ass coach
like that.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.678
He just showed me a lot, bro.
Soft-ass.

06:28.638 --> 06:29.722
[Buddy] Y'all's ball game is done.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.641
Y'all's ball game is done.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.434
Y'all's ball game is done.
Go.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.229
I asked y'all to handle shit.
You didn't handle it.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.564
-I can't help-- Hey, I can't help--
-[referee] Come on, Buddy.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.024
[Buddy] No, no, no. No, no.
Hey, I--

06:40.108 --> 06:41.234
No, I didn't?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.444
Shit, I'm the one that begged
your damn ass.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.530
I begged your damn ass.
I'm okay.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.823
You piece of shit.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.741
Bring your ass back over here
and let me whip your ass.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.328
Come on, bring your ass back over here
and let me whip your ass.

[Isaiah] <i>Weak-ass shit, man.</i>
<i>That's some weak-ass shit.</i>

[player] Man, fuck them.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.418
Taking our shit away from us,
man, like that.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.629
Y'all took our shit
away from us like that.

07:01.712 --> 07:05.216
That's some bullshit, man.
That's some straight bullshit, man.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.176
They took that shit
away from us like that, man.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.469
[Jawon] Come on, man.
Come on.

Man, that's bullshit.
That's fucking bullshit, man!

[Marcel] Fuck them fuckin' niggas, boy!
Fuckin' pussy shit!

07:17.019 --> 07:18.688
[officer] What's the player's name,
right here?

07:18.771 --> 07:19.939
[Buddy] I don't know.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.399
-You don't know?
-I don't know.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.151
[officer] Well, he fixin'
to go to jail if you don't...

07:23.234 --> 07:25.194
[Buddy] No, ain't nobody
going to jail 'cause you gotta file...

07:25.278 --> 07:26.404
you gotta file reports.
We had someone--

07:26.487 --> 07:28.739
-I'll file a report against you, too!
-What am I going to jail for?

07:28.823 --> 07:29.907
-What am I going to jail for?
-Okay?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.325
-Tell me what I'm going to jail for.
-Coach! Coach!

07:31.409 --> 07:33.828
-Come on, come on. Come on.
-Tell me what I'm going to jail for.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.955
[Buddy] I don't know who
you're pointing to, damn it!

07:36.038 --> 07:37.123
Come on, Coach!
Come on, Coach!

07:37.206 --> 07:38.583
I'mma always fight for y'all, bro.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.917
-Thanks, man.
-[Allenzae] Coach Stephens...

07:40.001 --> 07:42.962
Coach Stephens come in my face
with that dumb shit, I'mma punch his ass.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.338
I don't give a fuck, man.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.799
Ain't no fuckin' coach
supposed to be talkin' like this, man!

07:46.883 --> 07:47.717
[Buddy] <i>Shit!</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:50.678
The next word that you use of profanity,
you're going to jail.

07:50.761 --> 07:51.762
Next what, now, sir?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.514
The next word you use of profanity,
you're going to jail.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.891
What did I say?
What did I say?

07:54.974 --> 07:58.478
What you talking to my coach for
like that, bro?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.104
[Buddy] Why are you grabbing me, huh?

08:00.229 --> 08:01.856
Why are you grabbing me?

08:01.939 --> 08:04.692
I want charges on him
for putting his hands on me for no reason.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.110
Go on in the locker room, Coach.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.029
Coach, come on.
Let's go in the locker room.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.406
-Come on, let's go. Come on.
-Go head on in the locker room, then.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.700
Coach, how y'all let that
shit go down like that, man?

08:12.783 --> 08:13.951
You can't react like that.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.330
-Man, they did that shit, man!
-What you mean we can't react like that?

08:17.413 --> 08:19.207
[indistinct shouting]

08:19.290 --> 08:20.625
We on their side of the field, man!

08:25.046 --> 08:26.339
[Buddy] <i>What's done is done.</i>

08:26.422 --> 08:29.342
I never, in a million years,

08:29.425 --> 08:32.470
would imagine that this season
would end up like this.

08:32.553 --> 08:36.097
'Cause they baited y'all into that
the whole ball game.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.517
They ain't got nothing to lose,

08:37.600 --> 08:41.102
they just took out
the number three team in the country...

08:41.187 --> 08:42.897
by getting in your head...

08:42.980 --> 08:44.065
[player exhales sharply]

08:44.148 --> 08:50.446
...and planning on your redneck,
hood, thug attitude

08:50.530 --> 08:52.156
-would come out.
-[indistinct angry muttering]

08:52.240 --> 08:54.617
-[Buddy] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
-What the fuck you talking about?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.452
You knew who the fuck I was
when you recruited me, homeboy.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.828
[Buddy] Well, do you got it?

08:57.912 --> 09:00.915
Shut up! You acted like a--

09:00.998 --> 09:06.170
I mean, wild maniacs... in a street fight.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.673
Call it whatever you want.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.259
You weren't taking up for your buddy.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.261
That ain't what it was about!

09:18.474 --> 09:20.977
[Lesley] They could have killed DJ Law.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.020
Could have killed him.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.773
And didn't a damn one
of their coaches stop them.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.318
Yeah, well.
It's part of it.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.488
Yeah, I guess.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.739
[indistinct chatter]

09:33.823 --> 09:34.907
[player] <i>Oh, we gotta get going.</i>

09:34.991 --> 09:37.118
[Ollie] That's the white man, bro.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.704
Welcome to the real world.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.539
That's the white man.
Welcome to the real world.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.291
We can't do shit about it.
It's over.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.003
[Ollie] Coach Stephens
don't give a fuck about us.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.838
He don't give a fuck about us.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.798
Y'all heard that shit
he was saying, right?

09:50.881 --> 09:52.216
He don't give a fuck!

09:52.300 --> 09:54.218
I'm letting y'all niggas know.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.429
I know that shit, on my mama.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.139
[indistinct chatter]

09:58.222 --> 10:00.016
He don't give no fuck, bro!

10:00.099 --> 10:03.269
He don't give no fuck
about damn one of us, man.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.478
Tell you what he worried about, man.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.731
He worried about his
motherfucking juice, bro.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.442
It's the only thing he care about.
He worried about his juice.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.527
How much juice Coach Stephens got?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.654
How much rank he got?

10:13.738 --> 10:15.990
Nigga don't give a fuck!

10:16.073 --> 10:17.491
I don't need that nigga for shit.

10:17.575 --> 10:21.162
Been living by myself for...
nigga, 12, 13 years.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.830
Ain't never had a nigga to give me shit.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.249
[player] Nigga don't even call out
one motherfuckin' play.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.286
[Isaiah] Yeah, we was...
we was out there helping him out.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.121
{\an8}The whole team,
he was fighting the whole team.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.500
{\an8}Coming from the same motherfucker
that just got suspended two weeks ago

11:07.583 --> 11:09.835
{\an8}for fighting a damn referee.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.381
{\an8}But we thugs and rednecks.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.716
So what the fuck that make you?
The leader of the thugs and rednecks.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.052
[Isaiah] The leader of the thugs.
[chuckles] Exactly.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.638
The leader of the fucking
thugs and rednecks.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.898
[Wyatt] I think he lost a lot of respect.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.400
He really did, bro.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.235
You show your true colors when you're mad,

11:34.318 --> 11:36.237
and he said what he had to say,
so just leave it at that, bro.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.365
[stutters] A lot of them
boys don't even want to play for him.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.412
[Wood] <i>I know I had two or three people</i>
<i>comment to me today,</i>

11:44.495 --> 11:46.997
that you guys did a great job
staying on the sideline for a long time.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.666
Then finally, just...
couldn't stand there anymore,

11:48.749 --> 11:51.794
we got guys getting kicked to death
and everything else, so...

11:51.877 --> 11:54.088
You did a good job with what you had.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.633
[player chuckles]

11:57.716 --> 12:00.761
I would rather recruit guys
that's gonna stick up for themselves

12:00.845 --> 12:03.597
{\an8}and their brothers in time of need...

12:04.974 --> 12:07.810
{\an8}than guys that are gonna sit back
and just let things happen.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.645
<i>No, no.</i>

12:23.159 --> 12:26.495
[Luke] <i>I've seen a lot of slack</i>
<i>on Facebook and stuff about,</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:29.165
{\an8}"You were ahead of 'em 48 points
and it's 59 seconds left.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.460
{\an8}Before halftime, you call
two time-outs to try to score again."

12:32.543 --> 12:34.670
<i>But in order to move up,</i>

12:34.753 --> 12:38.632
<i>especially when you're number three,</i>
<i>they go by a point spread system.</i>

12:38.716 --> 12:41.677
And if you want
what's best for your team...

12:44.096 --> 12:46.223
you're gonna try to get 'em
at least number two

12:46.307 --> 12:48.476
so you can play
in the National Championship.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.352
[Salter] <i>When you run</i>
<i>the score up like that...</i>

12:50.436 --> 12:53.314
{\an8}-that leaves marks.
-[Wagner] Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yes.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.816
I don't mind beating 'em,
but we're so much better.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.068
Well, they're-- But...
Yeah. I just... I don't know.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.237
It's like kicking somebody
when they're down, you know?

13:00.321 --> 13:01.697
They teach you not to do that.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.158
-And then on Facebook, you see this--
-Uh, well...

13:04.241 --> 13:05.951
{\an8}I know.
Yeah, now that makes me furious.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.287
{\an8}-"Thugs. They're all thugs."
-That makes me...

13:08.370 --> 13:10.331
{\an8}How the hell can you say that?
You don't even know one of them.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.501
When you do
the kind of things we're doing,

13:13.584 --> 13:15.419
it does wind up hurting those kids.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.921
[Jay grunts]

13:17.004 --> 13:18.380
And that's... that's the bad part.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.548
-[Wagner] Hey, Jay.
-What's up?

13:19.632 --> 13:20.966
How you doing?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.426
-Come on in here and sit down.
-What you doing, bud?

13:22.510 --> 13:24.345
Nah, I just come here to visit.

13:24.428 --> 13:27.681
[Wagner] <i>Well, this year,</i>
<i>it's like we can't do anything right.</i>

13:27.765 --> 13:29.642
To me, when your program starts,

13:29.725 --> 13:34.688
when any program gets to that point
where it's just one thing after another...

13:35.814 --> 13:38.984
[sighs] usually that's the beginning
of the end.

13:42.988 --> 13:47.284
{\an8}EMCC is leading 48 to nothing,
when officials decide to stop play.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.828
{\an8}[newscaster 1]
<i>It is a full-on fight out there.</i>

13:49.912 --> 13:53.916
[newscaster 2] <i>Calling two time-outs</i>
<i>before halftime, while up 48-nothing.</i>

13:53.999 --> 13:56.252
[newscaster 3] <i>Up 48-nothing?</i>
<i>Have some class.</i>

13:56.335 --> 13:59.380
<i>Just have some respect</i>
<i>for your opponent in the game.</i>

13:59.463 --> 14:02.716
[newscaster 4] <i>You don't want somebody</i>
<i>to get up 48-nothing. Stop 'em.</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:05.719
-What in the world's going on, man?
-[man] We've seen it before.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.888
Coach Stephens got into some problems
with the officials...

14:07.972 --> 14:09.640
[newscaster 5] <i>No word</i>
<i>on punishment for this.</i>

14:09.723 --> 14:13.769
<i>EMCC is slated to begin the playoffs</i>
<i>as the number one seed next week.</i>

14:13.852 --> 14:14.812
A bombshell today.

14:14.895 --> 14:20.818
{\an8}<i>EMCC has been disqualified</i>
<i>from the upcoming MACJC football playoff.</i>

14:20.901 --> 14:24.488
{\an8}Officials there say they do plan to appeal
the decision, to try to get back in.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.781
But as for now,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.993
East Mississippi has been banned
from post-season play.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.706
Mama, I could give a shit.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.541
[door creaks open]

14:37.877 --> 14:40.129
I don't watch CNN.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.506
I don't give a shit about CNN.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.885
Mama, I'm not trying to be an asshole,
but, I mean, come on.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.721
-Love you, too.
-[man] We should get a caravan.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.180
Bye.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.725
Ethan Orr just tweeted,
"Our season is over."

14:53.976 --> 14:55.686
[Lesley] Tell him to stop tweeting.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.733
Kids these days...

15:00.816 --> 15:02.526
[Lesley] I hate it for a sophomore.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.737
I'm talking about guys
like Tillman and Ollie and them,

15:04.820 --> 15:06.697
that are on the bubble
of getting the offer that they want...

15:06.780 --> 15:08.032
[man] Yeah, yeah.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.992
-[clears throat] Now it's gone.
-[man] Yeah.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.827
[indistinct chatter]

15:16.624 --> 15:18.542
[interviewer] Ollie,
where you trying to go play?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.794
No fucking where.
The crib.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.380
[all laughing]

15:23.464 --> 15:24.965
[interviewer] Have you got an offer yet?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.508
[Ollie] Nope.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.760
Has anybody got an offer?

15:27.843 --> 15:28.969
[both] Nope.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.596
[Marcel chuckles]

15:30.679 --> 15:32.306
They said if we win,
they gonna come.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.391
But we ain't win. [chuckles]

15:34.475 --> 15:36.852
-So them bitches ain't coming.
-[Marcel chuckles] They ain't coming.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.069
[Williams] <i>There's a Division I school</i>

15:45.152 --> 15:48.948
<i>that, you know, we're gonna</i>
<i>send a tape out to about for Ollie.</i>

15:49.031 --> 15:52.785
Ollie missed three games this year
because of a concussion.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.788
This particular D-I school said,
"Hey, we need some tape."

15:55.871 --> 15:57.665
<i>He doesn't have enough tape.</i>

15:57.748 --> 16:02.044
<i>He doesn't have enough tape to, you know,</i>
<i>for them to make a proper evaluation.</i>

16:02.127 --> 16:06.006
Guess how many games we would have played
if we would've went all the way?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.257
Three.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.510
First round of the playoffs,
second round of the playoffs,

16:09.593 --> 16:11.261
then the National Championship game.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.055
So he would have got
those three games back.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.644
[Marcel] <i>You ain't going to class</i>
<i>for real?</i>

16:19.812 --> 16:21.021
It's pointless.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.566
If Wyatt said he ain't going to class,
I definitely ain't going to class.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.860
[Ollie] It's over with.
You might as well come on.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.908
[Ollie] Everybody leaving.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.702
Everybody leave?

16:34.785 --> 16:37.079
Man, listen,
ain't nobody gonna be here, bro.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.164
[Marcel] That's a wrap!

16:39.248 --> 16:41.667
[Wagner] <i>Oh, everybody missed on Monday.</i>

16:42.167 --> 16:44.294
Three pages of absences.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.255
Practically the whole team
didn't go to class.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.507
DJ Law walked out of class--

16:48.590 --> 16:49.925
[frustrated grunt]

16:51.593 --> 16:53.137
[sighs]

16:55.055 --> 16:58.475
-You got dropped.
-I already knew that.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.227
[sighs] Why?

17:00.310 --> 17:02.062
[DJ] From algebra class?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.106
No. Don't tell me you got
dropped from that, too.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.273
Uh-uh.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.942
Can't miss English or algebra no more.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.444
[Wagner] You can't miss anything anymore.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.779
Because you have three in English,

17:10.863 --> 17:15.242
you have three in history,
and you have five in math.

17:15.325 --> 17:18.119
Okay. So I can't miss nothing, nothing.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.705
-No class no more.
-No.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.875
[Wagner] <i>A part of me appreciates the fact</i>
<i>that he comes in here</i>

17:22.958 --> 17:24.501
<i>and basically tell me he got dropped.</i>

17:24.585 --> 17:26.462
<i>And he's smiling and like,</i>

17:26.545 --> 17:31.425
"I got ya,"
attitude like he's not defeated.

17:31.508 --> 17:36.263
A part of me totally appreciates that
and, like, loves him for that.

17:36.346 --> 17:39.099
And then there's a part of me
that it just pisses me off.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.101
Only got dropped from one class, right?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.687
[Wagner] So far. But don't...
[stutters] Are you...

17:43.812 --> 17:45.147
Do you know something I don't know?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.399
-[laughs] No, I'm just asking.
-[Wagner chuckles]

17:47.483 --> 17:49.985
'Cause everybody else...
everybody else got dropped

17:50.069 --> 17:52.488
and I'm like, um, just one class.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.697
Gotta get the rest of them.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.574
Yeah, I need... yeah.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.660
You've got to make
an "A" in Castleberry.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.037
-Got to?
-Mmm-hmm.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.663
-In Castleberry?
-Mmm-hmm.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.041
You cannot make a "B."

18:04.124 --> 18:06.835
All right.
Ain't got nothing else to do.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.144
[Wood] It's a bad deal.
Just a bad deal.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.940
{\an8}It's a bad deal for some good kids.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.734
{\an8}[Buddy] But still, Marcus, I keep
going back to the decision

18:30.818 --> 18:33.779
that they made when
they ran their butt on the field. [sighs]

18:33.862 --> 18:36.824
I'm the same way.
I'd have been the same way.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.743
But at that point--

18:39.827 --> 18:41.912
[Wood] They were off the field,
though, till the second...

18:41.995 --> 18:44.957
the skirmish breaks out and the kid's
getting just stomped to death, you know.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.668
Still, you let the referees
handle that and let that--

18:47.751 --> 18:49.086
[Wood] But they didn't, the refs left.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.922
-The ref went away. [chuckles]
-I know.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.133
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

18:54.216 --> 18:57.094
Tried to play a game.
Tried to do it right. It's unbelievable.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.887
Bad deal, man.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.516
I'm not trying to condone
running on to the field,

19:02.599 --> 19:04.768
I'm not saying that, but...

19:04.852 --> 19:06.812
if you watch the video,
you'll see 'em,

19:06.895 --> 19:10.524
our guys stay back, and stay back,
and stay back, and then...

19:10.607 --> 19:13.026
I don't know, at some point,
you gotta protect 'em.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.698
I'd want my kid protected.
I don't know.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.784
But... [sniffs] nothing you can do.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.080
Nothing you can do.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.835
[clamoring on television]

20:22.095 --> 20:23.889
[man 1 on radio]
<i>The coach has a rep already.</i>

20:23.972 --> 20:26.099
<i>He's already been, uh,</i>
<i>ejected from a game</i>

20:26.183 --> 20:27.684
<i>and fined or whatever.</i>

20:27.768 --> 20:30.437
<i>To me, that's a trickle-down effect</i>
<i>to the team.</i>

20:30.562 --> 20:34.024
[man 2] <i>Why are you calling two time-outs</i>
<i>to get the ball back up 48 to zero?</i>

20:34.107 --> 20:35.150
[man 1] <i>Exactly.</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:38.487
[man 2] <i>We're hearing they may not</i>
<i>be able to participate in the playoffs.</i>

20:38.570 --> 20:39.613
[man 3] <i>That's ridiculous.</i>

20:39.696 --> 20:42.532
<i>You're gonna make them not play</i>
<i>in the playoffs because of a fight?</i>

20:42.616 --> 20:44.451
<i>It's a man's game.</i>
<i>Men fight.</i>

20:50.082 --> 20:52.125
We've been in Ecclesiastes, right?

20:56.171 --> 20:59.633
"Life is monotonous,
life is mysterious,

20:59.716 --> 21:02.844
life is unpredictable
and life is unfair."

21:04.221 --> 21:06.014
That's from Solomon.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.353
It is unpredictable.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.940
It is unfair sometimes.
So now we have to deal with it.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.654
[photocopier beeps]

21:21.863 --> 21:24.324
[Wagner] <i>I have been told</i>
<i>that there is a meeting happening today</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:27.953
<i>with all the important people.</i>

21:28.036 --> 21:31.665
<i>Um, our president,</i>
<i>our athletic director, Buddy,</i>

21:31.748 --> 21:34.293
<i>our school attorney,</i>
<i>and then the commissioner.</i>

21:34.376 --> 21:38.463
We have appealed
their decision to disqualify us,

21:38.547 --> 21:40.674
um, from the playoffs.
So...

21:42.342 --> 21:43.969
you know, fingers are crossed,
I guess,

21:44.052 --> 21:46.763
that they overturn that decision
and that they let us play.

21:46.847 --> 21:50.309
[Buddy stammering]
Now, I had a lot of words.

21:50.392 --> 21:54.062
And I have to apologize for a lot of words
that I had after the game.

21:54.855 --> 21:58.275
Because after watching the video,
I'm damn proud of y'all.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.193
I'm damn proud of you.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.654
Because I don't think
you acted in a thuggish manner.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.907
I think, by God, you were out there
taking care of each other.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.952
And I'm proud of you.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.579
No matter what happens.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.040
I'm proud of this team
and I'm proud to be the head coach here.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.000
And I'm proud of you.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.336
But what happened on that football field

22:17.419 --> 22:21.131
was already in motion
before that game ever started. Okay?

22:21.214 --> 22:22.799
Hit the lights for me, please.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.136
You see our guys, we leave the bench,

22:26.219 --> 22:29.181
but our guys are composed enough
to listen to their coaches.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.308
But their bench is entirely cleared.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.602
One of Delta's coaches here,

22:33.685 --> 22:36.646
just walks off and leaves
Reed on the ground.

22:36.730 --> 22:40.442
{\an8}And somewhere around here,
number 70 uses a helmet.

22:43.612 --> 22:49.242
{\an8}This is the exact video that the NJCAA
got to look at and rule on our appeal.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.078
[murmuring]

22:51.161 --> 22:53.538
Now, we... Hey, listen to me.
No matter...

22:53.622 --> 22:56.708
No matter what happens, okay?

22:56.792 --> 23:00.837
No matter what happens,
I promise you, you've been fought for.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.798
'Cause I'm going to tell you something.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.549
I'm not going to have my name,

23:04.633 --> 23:08.011
your name, and this college's name
drug around by a bunch of...

23:08.095 --> 23:09.721
by a bunch of people
that didn't really care.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.307
Okay? We're going to continue
doing what we do.

23:12.390 --> 23:14.309
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop this train.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.353
We've said that from the get-go.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.563
[indistinct chatter]

23:23.735 --> 23:26.029
I just got a Twitter message.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.989
And it's from fuckin' Rhett Lashlee.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.116
Who's that?

23:29.199 --> 23:30.367
He's the offensive coordinator
from Auburn.

23:30.450 --> 23:33.286
-I see you, John Franklin.
-That's you. That's you.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.873
[Wagner] He's got an "A"
in Western Civ II.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.917
A "B" in Human Growth and Development.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.545
He's in good shape.

23:41.628 --> 23:44.005
[over phone] <i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

23:44.089 --> 23:46.466
You're welcome.
Okay. Bye-bye.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.262
It's Auburn calling about John Franklin.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.097
They offered him on Friday.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.181
I'll be there with you, bro.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.142
I'm going on all five of my visits,
though, just for vacation.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.810
-Got to. Where you gonna go, bro?
-[Ollie] Hell yeah!

23:56.893 --> 23:57.894
Every weekend.
Every weekend.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.272
I'm not staying here no longer
than I got to.

24:00.355 --> 24:01.439
Yo.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.567
<i>The Auburn scout, man,</i>
<i>that was nothing but God,</i>

24:03.650 --> 24:05.235
<i>because Wyatt ends up getting hurt</i>

24:05.318 --> 24:08.446
and then I end up scoring
six touchdowns before halftime.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.116
Like, you know what I'm saying?
Like, you can't think that's gonna happen

24:11.199 --> 24:12.284
the day before the game.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.035
It's just something that just happens
and you'll be like,

24:14.119 --> 24:16.746
"Man, that was my opportunity
and I made the most of that opportunity."

24:16.830 --> 24:18.582
I feel bad for y'all, though.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.250
'Cause y'all got
a whole other year of this bullshit.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.586
[both laughing]

24:22.669 --> 24:24.004
That shit ain't funny.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.256
That shit is funny, 'cause I'm out.
And I ain't coming back.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.716
I'm gonna talk to y'all
through Twitter, though.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.634
-[Ollie yells]
-I ain't coming back, though.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.680
-Ollie, you coming back? [chuckles]
-Coming back for what?

24:33.763 --> 24:35.015
For what?

24:35.098 --> 24:37.100
-Coming back for what?
-I ain't coming back for nothing.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.936
Nothing, boy.
I ain't even walking.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.898
-John, I ain't even walking.
-I ain't walking either, 'cause it's over.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.817
It's over with.
December here, I'm gone.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.194
[Williams] <i>Listen, listen.</i>

24:47.277 --> 24:49.779
Supposedly, we're supposed
to hear something back tonight.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.031
Or today.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.909
Don't know when it's gonna be, but...

24:53.992 --> 24:58.246
One thing we don't want y'all guys to do
is lose your mindset as far as playing.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.831
-[Marcel] Yo.
-Okay?

24:59.915 --> 25:02.918
All right? So, you know...

25:03.001 --> 25:04.878
I know some of you may feel, still,

25:04.961 --> 25:08.548
still feel some type of way
about some things that was said.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.551
But if you get an opportunity
to play, guys, that's...

25:11.635 --> 25:14.262
that's out the door. Okay?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.597
Now, I don't know where we at.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.975
We dropped to number ten in the country,
you know?

25:19.059 --> 25:20.393
Fuck that.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.270
We just want to play for the state.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.025
[Williams] Come here. Hey.

25:27.108 --> 25:29.402
What's that attitude for?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.029
'Cause, man...

25:31.112 --> 25:32.489
Because what?

25:32.572 --> 25:35.283
Because this shit's over with.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.953
I don't know, man.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.371
Man, stop acting like that, man.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.456
This is a rough time for everybody.

25:41.539 --> 25:42.624
I know.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.125
Don't be negative right now, Ollie.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.002
Don't nobody know
what the fuck's going on.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.545
We're trying to prepare mentally
for a game.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.464
You don't want to play no more?

25:49.547 --> 25:50.590
Huh?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.175
I'm gonna play.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.718
That ain't my question.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.096
Do I want to? No.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.931
[Williams] After here
you don't wanna play?

25:59.349 --> 26:00.517
[Buddy] Ollie!

26:01.434 --> 26:02.644
What?

26:02.727 --> 26:05.605
[Buddy] You don't want to play
a playoff game?

26:05.689 --> 26:07.315
Ah, it'll help, but...

26:07.399 --> 26:08.525
It'll help what?

26:08.608 --> 26:12.529
It'll help recruiting,
but there ain't shit happening now, so...

26:12.612 --> 26:13.655
Huh?

26:13.738 --> 26:15.156
Ain't shit happenin' now, so, I mean...

26:15.240 --> 26:16.283
What do you mean?

26:16.366 --> 26:17.575
-I mean--
-[stammers] Who got--

26:17.659 --> 26:20.745
Who got offered by Auburn
because of their game?

26:20.829 --> 26:23.540
-John Franklin.
-Yeah, because of the game.

26:23.623 --> 26:27.127
The recruiting stuff ain't over.
What did I tell y'all last year?

26:27.210 --> 26:29.587
[stammering] The more games you play,
the more people--

26:29.671 --> 26:30.672
Come.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.299
[Buddy] The recruitment will come.

26:32.382 --> 26:33.508
You know what I'm saying?

26:33.591 --> 26:35.927
You don't want that last ball game
to be your last ball game.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.762
-[Ollie] No.
-You know what I'm saying?

26:37.846 --> 26:40.932
Just have a good attitude and go out there
and let's have a good day. All right?

26:41.016 --> 26:43.143
I'mma punch your butt in the nose.
All right?

26:43.226 --> 26:44.978
Go on.
I'mma punch you in the nose, now.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.314
[Wagner] <i>What's wrong with him?</i>

26:47.397 --> 26:51.359
Think he should be getting offers that,
you know...

26:51.443 --> 26:53.445
at least, like, Memphis and...

26:54.154 --> 26:55.196
like FCS offers--

26:55.280 --> 26:58.033
Why would you not at this point
entertain all offers?

26:58.116 --> 26:59.159
I don't know.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.411
Why did he tell SEMO
he was better than them?

27:01.494 --> 27:02.662
-He told them that?
-Yes.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.456
Like, he actually told them?

27:04.539 --> 27:07.417
[Wagner stammering] In a Twitter message.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.879
The coach sent it to me
last night at 7:30. They're pissed.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.506
[Marcel] He had to be...
Not to be rude, but--

27:13.590 --> 27:15.342
"At Coach,
I can't see myself playing there.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.260
I really think I'm better than that.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.556
I know I don't have anything going on,
but I guess it is what it is.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.850
Thank you,
and I appreciate the opportunity."

27:24.851 --> 27:26.853
[Marcel] Why would he say that? Man.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.481
-He has one offer, and it's them.
-Yeah.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.609
They're a Division I double-A.
Like, what the freak?

27:32.692 --> 27:33.693
Right.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.862
The guy told me when he was here
the other day, he said,

27:35.945 --> 27:37.655
"We've got one junior college player
in the whole country

27:37.739 --> 27:39.366
that we're taking this year."

27:39.449 --> 27:41.534
And it's him,
and then he sends him that message.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.953
He ain't want to talk to UAB yesterday.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.121
-[Wagner] Ollie?
-Yeah.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.123
Why would he not talk to UAB?
Like...

27:47.207 --> 27:51.711
Hmm, I don't know. That's a tough one,
the guy was waiting on Ollie.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.256
-Guess he--
-Has anybody talked to him?

27:55.340 --> 27:57.133
Like, any of our coaches, like...

27:57.217 --> 28:00.303
pulled him aside and talked to him
about, like, what he's doing?

28:00.387 --> 28:04.265
Nope. I don't know what he wants.
I don't know where he wants to go.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.226
I know where he wants to go.
He wants to go to Auburn.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.728
Well, guess what.
They don't want you.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.355
-Yeah?
-So...

28:11.398 --> 28:12.565
[Marcel] You gotta face the music.

28:12.649 --> 28:16.653
What he wants is irrelevant at this point.
You gotta take what you're getting.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.072
[indistinct chatter]

28:22.742 --> 28:24.786
[player 1] This is disappointing.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.913
On some "what if" type shit.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.289
What if.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.916
[player 2] What if I won
the lottery right now?

28:29.999 --> 28:32.544
That shit is stupid, bro.
Ah! What if, what if we...

28:32.627 --> 28:34.045
After practice they get a call. "Oh!

28:34.129 --> 28:35.380
Y'all won't be playing."

28:35.463 --> 28:38.508
We just had a 'what if' practice
for no fucking reason. Wasting my time.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.135
[indistinct chatter]

29:03.283 --> 29:05.410
I got mad at my bunch
after the game and...

29:06.411 --> 29:08.121
after it was over with,
and you just go,

29:08.204 --> 29:11.291
"I wished I'd have
just watched the film first."

29:11.374 --> 29:14.419
Because I saw exactly
how good they did do.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.254
All right, we got offense.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.468
-[indistinct shouting]
-[whistle blows]

29:21.551 --> 29:24.387
[Buddy groaning] You can't let 'em twist!

29:24.471 --> 29:28.308
You cannot let 'em twist on 30.
You gotta get to 'em, and drive 'em.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.728
Fuck that shit.
I just want to get high.

29:31.811 --> 29:35.106
Just wanna get high?
A blunt and brainstorm.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.901
I don't even wanna brainstorm.
I just wanna get high as fuck.

29:37.984 --> 29:42.155
Tonight, if we end up making this thing,
I need everybody to be positive, okay?

29:42.238 --> 29:44.574
-All right? You do that?
-Okay. Okay.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.994
I love you.
And I wanna tell you somethin',

29:48.077 --> 29:49.287
that I promise you that we're gonna...

29:49.370 --> 29:50.872
If we get to play,
we gonna win these two games,

29:50.955 --> 29:52.207
you gonna play
in the National Championship.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.541
-I got you.
-I love you, bro.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.877
-Love you, too, Coach.
-Take care.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.922
You got your fields planted?
So the rain's in good?

29:59.005 --> 30:00.590
You going to take me
and my daughter one time?

30:00.673 --> 30:02.133
Yeah. I gotta good spot to shoot.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.259
I want her to kill a deer.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.427
Oh, I got you.
I got a good spot.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.641
[cell phone chimes]

30:11.059 --> 30:13.561
[Buddy] Received email
that appeal has been denied.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.897
It was unanimous with one abstention.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.658
[whistle blowing]

30:26.741 --> 30:28.785
[Buddy] Everybody up!
Let's go!

30:36.251 --> 30:39.128
All right. Here we go.
Hey. All right.

30:40.463 --> 30:43.258
Got an email or text message
from the president.

30:43.341 --> 30:45.134
He said our appeal was denied.

30:46.052 --> 30:49.848
Um, so, what it is, is what it is.

30:51.307 --> 30:55.520
You know, I'm gonna tell you something.
I still stand by what I said earlier,

30:55.603 --> 30:57.146
I'm very proud of you.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.316
I'm very proud of the way
that you've handled yourselves.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.695
Uh, one of the best football teams
I've ever been associated with. Period.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.907
You will have your chance for vindication,

31:07.991 --> 31:12.412
but you have to understand...
life ain't fair all the time, all right?

31:12.495 --> 31:15.206
Fair is where you kiss a pig
and give it a blue ribbon.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.208
It ain't fair all the time.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.210
All right? And that's all I can say.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.463
I love you. We're gonna break it down.
We're gonna get together, say the prayer.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.633
We're gonna break it down one last time.
And we're gonna make sure--

31:25.717 --> 31:28.803
Hey. I want everybody to hear this.
All right? Everybody, get in here tight.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.930
Everybody.
Get in here tight. Let's go.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.016
Our Father...

31:33.099 --> 31:34.851
[all] Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.228
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.355
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,

31:39.439 --> 31:40.565
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

31:40.648 --> 31:43.192
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.736
-[all] Amen.
-Break it down. Let's go!

31:44.819 --> 31:46.237
[player] "Lions" on three,
"Champs" on six.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.363
-One, two, three!
-[players] Lions!

31:47.447 --> 31:48.615
-Four, five, six!
-[players] Champs!

31:48.698 --> 31:50.366
[Wood] Offense! Offense!

31:50.450 --> 31:55.330
On behalf of these coaches,
you're the state champs in our book, okay?

31:56.331 --> 31:57.373
So...

31:58.374 --> 32:01.210
I enjoyed it. All right?
Love y'all.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.670
[player] D-block on me!
"D-block" on three!

32:02.754 --> 32:04.422
-One, two, three!
-[players] D-block!

32:06.507 --> 32:07.926

33:12.156 --> 33:16.577
[Luke stammering] <i>It's a sad way</i>
<i>for the season to go out.</i>

33:16.661 --> 33:22.125
<i>Maybe some rules need to change</i>
<i>as far as, uh... officiating.</i>

33:22.959 --> 33:27.964
What I did see on the field was
one of our players getting very abused,

33:28.047 --> 33:30.383
<i>and nobody taking control of it.</i>

33:30.466 --> 33:34.762
<i>I believe a little more research should've</i>
<i>went in it before we got disqualified...</i>

33:36.723 --> 33:40.643
but that's just my opinion,
and I'm a maintenance man. [chuckles]

33:43.104 --> 33:44.564
[player laughing]

33:44.647 --> 33:49.652
[Wagner] Ollie, let's talk about this
visit you were gonna take this weekend.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.739
Is there a way that you could've
handled that situation better?

33:52.822 --> 33:53.865
What you mean?

33:53.948 --> 33:55.742
[Wagner] The situation with SEMO.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.286
Uh-uh. What are they saying?
What you mean?

33:58.369 --> 34:00.580
Sending 'em a message
that you're too good to play there.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.623
-I didn't say that, bro.
-Yeah, you did. I read it.

34:02.707 --> 34:05.251
-It wasn't that, though. I didn't say--
-That's what you said.

34:05.334 --> 34:09.088
Uh, no. You're making it seem
like I was just being a ass about it.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.757
Is it because you don't wanna fly?

34:10.840 --> 34:13.509
No, it ain't that.
I just think I'm better than that.

34:13.592 --> 34:14.761
[Marcel] What school?

34:14.844 --> 34:16.554
[Ollie] Southeastern Missouri.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.556
[Wagner] But what if that's your
only offer at the end of the day?

34:19.639 --> 34:21.184
It just...
This is what it is.

34:21.266 --> 34:24.771
[Wagner] Well, what's plan B then?
Then what're you gonna do?

34:24.853 --> 34:26.188
I don't know.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.110
[stammers] I don't know.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.780
It just is what it is, I guess.
It just gonna be what it is.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.407
[Wagner] Well, no, it is what it is
because you sent a Twitter message.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.243
I'm saying, like, I ain't have...
I ain't got his number or nothing.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.954
[Wagner] I do. And the dude'll drive
five hours to come pick you up.

34:42.038 --> 34:45.041
He already told me that.
"I'll drive ten hours in one day

34:45.123 --> 34:46.876
if that's what it's gonna take
to get him here.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.795
Because we want him
to come on this visit."

34:48.878 --> 34:49.879
If it's about flying...

34:49.962 --> 34:51.547
-[stammers] It ain't--
-...then, like, that's one thing.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.257
They'll come get you.
They want you bad enough. They're--

34:54.342 --> 34:57.512
Do you understand that they're taking
one D-lineman in the entire country,

34:57.595 --> 34:58.930
and you're the guy?

34:59.972 --> 35:04.936
If you have no interest and you don't
give a shit, then fine, I'll tell 'em.

35:06.562 --> 35:07.730
[John] You scared to fly?

35:08.648 --> 35:09.732
I ain't no fool, unless...

35:09.816 --> 35:13.528
I ain't scared to fly, bro,
it just... I don't know. [sighs]

35:13.611 --> 35:16.739
Bro, free school better than no school.
I already told you that yesterday, though.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.866
[Ollie] It is what it is.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.201
Just to have it in your back pocket.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.494
Just in case everything
don't work out, bro.

35:21.577 --> 35:22.620
[Ollie] Yeah.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.958
[John] If you get that deal,
you fixin' to go to the league, bro.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.633
[indistinct chatter]

35:35.716 --> 35:37.301
[intercom beeps]

35:37.385 --> 35:38.469
[John's mom on PA] <i>Hello, teachers.</i>

35:38.553 --> 35:42.306
We are getting ready to do
the sign-in of John Franklin III

35:42.390 --> 35:45.810
{\an8}to Auburn University
in the conference room at this time.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.147
<i>If you would like to be</i>
<i>a part of history...</i>

35:49.230 --> 35:52.150
-How are you, sweetie? Congratulations.
-I'm all right.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.864
[woman] Let's go ahead
and take that pen.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.532
Let's make it official.

36:02.034 --> 36:03.953
Congratulations.
And with that, it's official.

36:04.036 --> 36:05.788
You're going to Auburn.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.291
[cheering]

36:10.793 --> 36:13.254
Thanks for supporting me
from my journey from South,

36:13.337 --> 36:15.339
you know, to Florida State,
and now to Auburn.

36:15.423 --> 36:19.510
Uh, it's been a long one, but I feel like
it's gonna be worth it in the long run.

36:19.594 --> 36:23.097
Thank you for all y'all done for me.
Appreciate it.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.224
-[woman] Thank you.
-[cheering]

36:26.559 --> 36:27.977
[John] <i>Yeah, unfortunately, you know,</i>

36:28.060 --> 36:30.229
<i>the brawl that happened</i>
<i>in the Mississippi Delta game</i>

36:30.354 --> 36:32.231
<i>messed up a lot of people recruiting.</i>

36:32.315 --> 36:34.609
<i>But, um, you know,</i>
<i>everything happens for a reason.</i>

36:34.692 --> 36:37.195
At the time, I needed to show
what I had to the right people,

36:37.278 --> 36:38.738
you know what I'm saying?

36:38.821 --> 36:41.949
<i>And, uh, I mean, I don't know</i>
<i>how it happened, but, you know,</i>

36:42.033 --> 36:44.952
<i>there's a man upstairs</i>
<i>that just made it happen that way.</i>

36:45.036 --> 36:47.747
<i>And it was just one of those games where,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

36:47.830 --> 36:50.166
as a athlete,
you dream of the perfect game,

36:50.249 --> 36:53.461
and it was...
that was the perfect game for me.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.963
[John's mom] So glad you guys made it.

36:56.631 --> 37:00.468
Wait. He's gonna sign cups.
He's gonna sign the Auburn cups.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.053
-Thank you, sir. Appreciate that.
-Anything for you.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.348
[man] John, you gotta get used to it. This
is how it's gonna be after your NFL games.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.933
[all laughing]

37:11.354 --> 37:12.772
[gunshot]

37:13.731 --> 37:18.694
[Wyatt] He running. Still running.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.238
That's it.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.907
Glad I ain't got
a hearing final next week...

37:23.908 --> 37:25.910
'cause I'm sure gonna be deaf.

37:25.993 --> 37:28.371
<i>Gonna hopefully get some offers.</i>
<i>Talk to some schools.</i>

37:28.454 --> 37:31.249
<i>It's a huge decision to make</i>
<i>at just 20 years old,</i>

37:31.332 --> 37:33.042
so you gotta think about it,
pray about it,

37:33.125 --> 37:35.544
and make a decision
that you feel comfortable with.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.547
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.633
<i>I'll have the opportunity</i>
<i>to go play somewhere, you know,</i>

37:40.716 --> 37:42.969
<i>uh, I don't know what level</i>
<i>or what league.</i>

37:43.052 --> 37:45.888
But, uh, if not, you know, if I decide
not to play and go to Mississippi State,

37:45.972 --> 37:50.101
I guess I'd just be a average Joe,
and just go to school and start working.

37:50.184 --> 37:51.310
[chuckles]

37:52.478 --> 37:55.439
He's funny because, like, he'll start...
Every conversation we've had,

37:55.523 --> 37:58.693
he'll start it with,
"I'm fine, I'm fine,

37:58.776 --> 38:01.320
like, you know, I'm just gonna
go to Mississippi State

38:01.404 --> 38:03.656
and be a regular student, like,
I'm cool. It's all good."

38:06.075 --> 38:08.911
<i>But then, he came in here one day</i>
<i>and I said to him,</i>

38:08.995 --> 38:11.205
<i>"Well, Wyatt, you do have some offers.</i>

38:11.289 --> 38:13.874
<i>Mississippi College,</i>
<i>which is a great academic school.</i>

38:13.958 --> 38:16.210
<i>And you still get to play,</i>
<i>maybe not at the level that you want to,</i>

38:16.294 --> 38:18.879
<i>but you still get to play,</i>
<i>versus just giving it up."</i>

38:18.963 --> 38:22.341
And he slammed the door and he said...

38:22.425 --> 38:27.138
"No." He said, "I backed up
Chad Kelly last year, all year,

38:27.221 --> 38:31.183
and he's freaking playing for Ole Miss
and leading the SEC.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.228
<i>This year, I started over</i>
<i>a Florida State transfer,</i>

38:34.312 --> 38:36.314
<i>and now he's going to Auburn.</i>

38:36.397 --> 38:38.733
I ain't going
to doggone Mississippi College."

38:39.942 --> 38:43.779
And I just was like,
"Okay. You know, point...

38:44.864 --> 38:45.906
point made."

38:56.250 --> 38:57.376
[Todd Cooley on speaker]
<i>What's up, brother?</i>

38:57.460 --> 38:59.628
I'm doing good.
[stammers] I'm...

38:59.712 --> 39:01.464
<i>Heard about y'all getting</i>
<i>kicked out of the playoffs.</i>

39:01.547 --> 39:04.133
{\an8}I'd like to make a trip to the Delta
with a baseball bat,

39:04.216 --> 39:05.760
{\an8}but other than that, I'm good.

39:05.843 --> 39:06.886
{\an8}<i>Yep.</i>

39:07.762 --> 39:09.722
Well, you know why we called time-out
right before the half?

39:09.805 --> 39:10.806
<i>Why's that?</i>

39:10.890 --> 39:14.060
The Auburn coach,
Rhett Lashlee, was there.

39:14.143 --> 39:15.436
<i>Mmm-hmm, I was sitting by him.</i>

39:15.519 --> 39:16.771
All right. Well, guess...

39:16.854 --> 39:18.939
We wanted him to see him
for another series.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.025
Guess what, they offered him.

39:21.108 --> 39:23.861
<i>Hey, Buddy, what about number 90?</i>

39:23.944 --> 39:27.281
He's gonna go somewhere,
but I just don't know where.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.576
He's, uh, yeah,
he's a really good football player.

39:30.659 --> 39:31.786
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:32.953 --> 39:34.997
<i>'Cause he's not gonna have a 2,5, is he?</i>

39:35.081 --> 39:36.916
[sing-song] I don't think so.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.168
[Wagner] You need to do the annotated bib.

39:39.251 --> 39:40.586
Because if you make a "D" in there,

39:40.669 --> 39:43.839
you gotta make a "B" in there
in order to have the 2,5.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.591
All right. I'm gonna do it.

39:46.592 --> 39:49.261
[Wagner] <i>I replaced the "F" with a "D",</i>
<i>worst case.</i>

39:49.345 --> 39:52.264
And when I plug all that in,
I have him at a 2,52.

39:52.348 --> 39:55.393
{\an8}Kid-wise... I mean, I know about
the playing-wise, what does that mean?

39:55.476 --> 39:56.602
{\an8}You know, I--

39:56.685 --> 39:59.730
{\an8}I love him.
He's got trust issues, obviously.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.024
-[Boone] I know.
-But once he trusts you...

40:02.108 --> 40:03.150
[Boone] Yeah.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.612
-I mean, good as... You're in.
-Okay.

40:06.695 --> 40:09.323
-You've been right for me for four times.
-[Wagner chuckles]

40:09.407 --> 40:10.950
Let's make it a fifth one.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.034
-All right.
-Okay.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.786
This'd be number five
you'd been right for me.

40:13.869 --> 40:15.746
-[chuckles]
-So, I'm counting on you.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.457
-All right. Well, I'm right again, so...
-[chuckling]

40:19.708 --> 40:24.338
I got a little text message this morning
that you had called...

40:26.173 --> 40:27.425
Who?

40:27.508 --> 40:29.718
You called SEMO back and told them...

40:29.802 --> 40:31.887
Ah, he had called me.

40:31.971 --> 40:35.307
Well, he told me that you had talked
to him and that you wanted to visit.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.101
-So?
-So, you're gonna go Friday?

40:37.184 --> 40:40.563
Yeah. I just wanted
to take the trip, I guess.

40:40.646 --> 40:42.356
Are you gonna fly?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.566
Yeah.

40:46.026 --> 40:48.112
I'll have my headphones there.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.782
Just chilling.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.535
Now, if something happen to me,
now, it is your fault.

40:54.618 --> 40:57.496
I'm gonna blame it on you.
Something--

40:57.580 --> 40:59.457
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.274
[announcer] <i>It's the</i>
<i>National Championship game.</i>

41:25.357 --> 41:27.818
<i>Do they not do it right in Biloxi?</i>

41:27.902 --> 41:29.904
<i>And Alex Norwood catches</i>
<i>the last touchdown of the game.</i>

41:29.987 --> 41:32.406
<i>Chism to Norwood, makes the catch.</i>

41:32.490 --> 41:37.953
<i>Northwest Mississippi Community College,</i>
<i>2015 National champs.</i>

41:39.371 --> 41:40.706
[cheering]

41:42.416 --> 41:44.793
[James] And now it is under way.

41:44.877 --> 41:47.046
Ezekiel Rose, back for the kick.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.631
[Ezekiel] Whoo! Ooh! Ooh!

41:48.714 --> 41:49.840
[James] Oh, he has a nice spin.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.718
-[grunting]
-He get hits out of bound.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.473
[James howls] And he's in!

41:57.556 --> 41:59.350
He's in for...

41:59.433 --> 42:01.060
Oh, yeah!

42:02.144 --> 42:03.729
-[James laughing]
-[Ezekiel] Yeah!

42:03.854 --> 42:06.065
[man] <i>Hey, so I hear both y'all</i>
<i>are from East Mississippi.</i>

42:06.148 --> 42:10.528
How do y'all feel about Northwest
winning the National Championship?

42:10.611 --> 42:14.657
Ah, man. Hey, look, we know who the real
champions are around here in JUCO, man.

42:14.740 --> 42:16.242
Every dog has their day, man.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.368
Yeah, every dog has their day.

42:17.451 --> 42:18.953
Messed up how they did 'em down there,
but you know,

42:19.036 --> 42:21.121
I know them boys gonna bounce back, man.
They got a good program,

42:21.205 --> 42:22.581
and they always will have one.

42:22.665 --> 42:25.251
So, you know, there's just no knowing
what's gonna happen next year.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.587
They came up here,
they beat them boys 66 to 13.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.339
Didn't we beat 'em, like, 30 points?

42:30.422 --> 42:33.551
-I think 48 to what? Twelve?
-Yeah, 16 or somethin'.

42:34.510 --> 42:36.637
{\an8}[Buddy] <i>Uh, I think we would</i>
<i>have been probably...</i>

42:36.720 --> 42:40.766
<i>ranked number one or number two</i>
<i>going into the playoffs.</i>

42:40.849 --> 42:44.061
And I've said all along, whoever wins
this year, put an asterisk beside it,

42:44.144 --> 42:45.896
because they know we weren't in it.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.815
And when it comes down to it, they know.

42:47.898 --> 42:50.484
They know.
They may tell their players different,

42:50.568 --> 42:51.735
they may tell their fans different,

42:51.819 --> 42:55.155
they may go home and tell
their wives different, but they know.

43:03.205 --> 43:06.542
[DJ] <i>After everything that happened,</i>
<i>I felt like most of it was my fault.</i>

43:06.625 --> 43:08.627
I put most of the blame on myself.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.129
I felt like it could have been avoided.

43:10.212 --> 43:12.965
Most of my teammates tell me
not to blame myself,

43:13.048 --> 43:15.593
'cause it could have happened to anybody,
you know, but...

43:15.676 --> 43:17.845
<i>everything happens for a reason.</i>

43:17.928 --> 43:22.349
<i>And now, it's just... Okay, now, I gotta</i>
<i>work, going to tutoring and all that.</i>

43:22.433 --> 43:24.518
<i>Got about three classes I have to pass.</i>

43:24.602 --> 43:26.937
If I can't do that,
you can't play no more.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.649
[typing]

43:33.152 --> 43:34.778
[Wagner] Whoa,
that makes a big difference.

43:35.487 --> 43:38.157
Whoo! All right, I can deal with that.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.658
-I can deal with that.
-[chuckling]

43:39.742 --> 43:43.203
That makes me feel better.
I was freaking out a little bit.

43:43.287 --> 43:46.498
This morning, at 8:30,
he walked in here.

43:46.582 --> 43:49.668
Never seen him on his own like that.

43:49.752 --> 43:53.839
I was shocked.
He had like 18 quizzes to make up.

43:53.922 --> 43:57.426
And he sat down,
and he was in here for two or so hours.

43:57.509 --> 43:58.844
-[recruiter] Mmm-hmm.
-And he took all the quizzes.

43:58.927 --> 44:01.347
He made up a test.

44:01.430 --> 44:04.642
So I think he's starting
to kind of figure it out at this point.

44:04.725 --> 44:05.934
-Well, good.
-I just hope he's not too late.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.604
In my experiences with players like this,

44:08.687 --> 44:11.440
<i>usually when December rolls around,</i>

44:11.523 --> 44:15.444
<i>and all their buddies sign,</i>
<i>usually shit gets real.</i>

44:16.487 --> 44:18.822
[DJ] <i>A change...</i>
<i>a change just came over me.</i>

44:18.906 --> 44:20.616
<i>I'm just worried about</i>
<i>keeping my grades up.</i>

44:20.699 --> 44:23.744
And I used to think
that school is hard, hard, hard, man.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.038
Like, I'd never be able to do this.

44:26.121 --> 44:29.583
If you put your mind to it, man,
you can do anything you wanna do.

44:29.667 --> 44:33.754
You put your mind to anything,
you can do anything you wanna do.

44:33.837 --> 44:35.047
Anything.

44:39.259 --> 44:40.678
[indistinct chatter]

44:41.595 --> 44:43.472
-[player] Put your helmet on.
-Are y'all ready?

44:43.555 --> 44:45.224
[John] I'm ready.
I'm about to flunk.

44:45.307 --> 44:46.350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:11.291 --> 45:13.168
[Wagner] <i>My heart will break</i>
<i>for Ronald Ollie</i>

45:13.252 --> 45:16.547
<i>if he doesn't have that 2,5 GPA,</i>

45:16.630 --> 45:18.715
<i>and he's not eligible for D-I.</i>

45:18.799 --> 45:22.136
Because I have no idea
what that kid will do.

45:22.219 --> 45:23.887
Like, there is no plan B.

45:38.610 --> 45:40.112
[indistinct chatter]

45:40.195 --> 45:41.822
[Wagner] But it's good.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.577
[Ollie sighs]

45:46.660 --> 45:48.328
Whoo! That's what my average is?

45:48.412 --> 45:51.206
[chuckles] Oh, man!

45:51.290 --> 45:53.917
-[Wagner] What's his average?
-Eighty-nine. [laughs]

45:54.001 --> 45:56.253
-[Wagner] Are you gonna round it up?
-I always do.

45:56.336 --> 45:57.880
[squeals and laughs]

45:57.963 --> 45:59.506
You made an "A"!

46:02.050 --> 46:03.302
[laughs]

46:04.720 --> 46:06.638
You made an "A", Ollie!

46:06.722 --> 46:08.515
Oh, man, that's crazy.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.851
-You did it.
-Yeah.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.812
You did it. How many hours
did you spend in that office?

46:13.937 --> 46:16.648
-Uh, too many?
-Uh... too many. [chuckles]

46:16.732 --> 46:18.484
[teacher] You know you got
family here, all right?

46:18.567 --> 46:20.652
-Yes, ma'am.
-Always. Okay?

46:20.736 --> 46:21.987
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

46:22.070 --> 46:24.573
I won't be back.
I made an "A".

46:24.656 --> 46:27.117
-You made an "A!"
-I made an "A."

46:27.201 --> 46:28.702
[both laughing]

46:32.372 --> 46:34.875
I made an "A" in Comp II.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.210
I made an "A."

46:36.293 --> 46:38.378
Stop, before my back goes out.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.297
You're gonna make my back go out.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.132
You made an "A," Ollie.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.592
Oh! Oh!

46:43.675 --> 46:46.678
Oh, I don't ever wanna hear you
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever say

46:46.762 --> 46:49.223
-you can't do anything, you hear me?
-Yes, ma'am.

46:49.306 --> 46:50.933
-Never say that.
-Yes, ma'am.

46:51.016 --> 46:53.143
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-Thank you!

46:53.227 --> 46:54.311
[Ollie] Ah, I made an "A."

46:54.394 --> 46:56.396
-Love ya!
-Yeah, love you, too.

46:56.480 --> 46:57.898
Man.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.318
[sighs]

47:10.327 --> 47:12.037
[Wagner] Good morning.
[player] Good morning.

47:12.120 --> 47:15.499
[rapping] Jay, that's right, bro.
Fuckin' last day.

47:15.582 --> 47:17.543
[both grunting]

47:19.044 --> 47:21.755
All right!
Oh, shit, uh, my back!

47:21.838 --> 47:24.299
[Wagner] Why are you walking around
with toilet paper in your hand?

47:24.383 --> 47:26.843
-Because I am the shit.
-[Wyatt] He is.

47:26.927 --> 47:29.763
[Wagner] So, you carry toilet paper
because you are the shit? [laughs]

47:29.846 --> 47:30.847
[stammers]

47:30.931 --> 47:31.932
Yeah!

47:32.015 --> 47:34.142
[grunts and sniffs]

47:34.226 --> 47:36.270
You liked that, didn't you?
You liked that.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.146
Wyatt, last day, baby!

47:38.230 --> 47:39.565
[chuckling]

47:39.648 --> 47:40.983
-[Ollie grunts]
-[Wyatt] What's up, Ollie?

47:41.066 --> 47:42.484
-[Ollie] Hey, man... [laughs]
-[gasps]

47:42.568 --> 47:43.819
[player] God!
[Wagner] Aw...

47:43.902 --> 47:45.487
-[Wyatt] What was that?
-[player groans]

47:45.571 --> 47:49.241
[John] I feel like... we've been locked up
at Scooba for two years.

47:49.324 --> 47:50.826
I've been in Scooba for two years.

47:50.909 --> 47:53.161
[laughing]

47:53.245 --> 47:54.663
[player] What you gonna do, bro?

47:54.746 --> 47:57.082
-I'm gonna kill somebody!
-[all laughing]

47:57.165 --> 47:59.084
[Ollie] We gotta take a selfie
with Miss Wagner.

47:59.167 --> 48:02.004
[Wagner] Are you ready to take yours?
[Ollie] Hell no!

48:02.087 --> 48:03.088
-[all laughing]
-[Wagner] Huh?

48:03.171 --> 48:04.881
I'm gonna get mine later on
when I'm getting ready to go.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.216
-Let's just take it right now.
-Uh-uh, because...

48:06.300 --> 48:07.968
I'll be crying then
and I'll look a hot mess.

48:08.051 --> 48:10.053
-So, just do it now.
-No, you ain't gonna cry.

48:10.137 --> 48:12.598
Hold on. Hold on.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.516
[sighs]

48:14.600 --> 48:16.393
One, two, three.

48:17.394 --> 48:20.814
I gotta drop the ball today,
to all these schools.

48:20.897 --> 48:22.399
[Wagner] What are you gonna do?

48:22.482 --> 48:24.234
-You've already made your decision?
-Yep.

48:24.318 --> 48:25.819
-Where are you going?
-Retiring.

48:26.778 --> 48:28.030
-Mississippi State?
-Yep.

48:28.113 --> 48:29.197
-Regular student.
-Yep.

48:29.281 --> 48:30.699
-Walking on?
-No.

48:30.782 --> 48:33.619
What? Ain't no way
you fixin' to just stop.

48:33.702 --> 48:34.911
-Got to.
-Why?

48:34.995 --> 48:38.081
'Cause ain't even... They still won't
even talk to me about walking on.

48:38.165 --> 48:41.376
[stammering] Like, I'm not gonna go
up there and just kiss their butt.

48:41.460 --> 48:44.212
-Can't do it. Won't do it.
-[Wagner] Go to Mississippi College.

48:44.296 --> 48:45.797
Yeah, why you gonna
quit playin' ball, bro?

48:45.881 --> 48:47.341
[Ollie] Go play D-II ball!
[Wagner] Don't be prideful

48:47.424 --> 48:49.509
and miss out on a free education
and a great opportunity

48:49.593 --> 48:51.887
just 'cause your ego hurts.

48:51.970 --> 48:53.138
-Nah.
-[Wagner] Come on, now.

48:53.221 --> 48:55.098
Man don't wanna play D-II ball.

48:55.182 --> 48:56.600
I don't wanna play D-II.

48:56.683 --> 48:57.809
[Wagner] Well, it's better than nothing.

48:57.893 --> 49:00.228
How many SEC signings did we get?
Two?

49:00.312 --> 49:02.189
-[Wagner] None? One.
-One?

49:02.272 --> 49:04.650
-[Wagner] Who's the second?
-I thought DJ Law would be the second.

49:04.733 --> 49:06.693
[Wagner] He ain't graduating.
What are you talking about?

49:06.777 --> 49:09.237
-Oh, yeah.
-Nobody's signing him till he graduates.

49:10.238 --> 49:12.991
Well, I can be in the woods by 3:00,
so we got to...

49:14.159 --> 49:15.535
get this show on the road.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.245
-[player] And you cry every year?
-Mmm-hmm.

49:17.329 --> 49:18.914
See, I couldn't handle your job.

49:18.997 --> 49:20.165
'Cause I get connected with people.

49:20.248 --> 49:21.708
[Wagner] Twice a year, I cry.

49:21.792 --> 49:25.754
'Cause I cry in December when...
and then I have to cry again in May.

49:25.837 --> 49:27.964
-'Cause I get all attached.
-I get attached, too. Exactly.

49:28.048 --> 49:30.092
-[Ollie mock cries]
-It's like losing children.

49:36.682 --> 49:38.558
I need you to be good over the break.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.811
And when you come back in January...

49:42.854 --> 49:44.481
-we're getting real.
-All right.

49:44.564 --> 49:49.319
We're not... missing class,
we're not leaving in the middle.

49:49.403 --> 49:51.738
We're getting this done,
and we're getting you somewhere else.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.990
-I just did, like, eight quizzes.
-Deal?

49:54.741 --> 49:55.951
[laughter]

49:56.034 --> 49:58.161
-Go!
-[both grunting]

50:02.332 --> 50:03.417
[John] <i>Sign me off.</i>

50:03.500 --> 50:05.752
Oh, I can't do both of y'all

50:05.836 --> 50:07.462
-at the same time!
-[Wyatt] Back-to-back.

50:07.546 --> 50:09.131
It's about that time.

50:09.214 --> 50:11.049
[Wagner] Aw...

50:11.133 --> 50:13.593
-Give me my slip, Warden.
-[chuckles]

50:13.677 --> 50:15.637
I was born for this moment.

50:17.139 --> 50:22.185
Whoo! Sender... recipient.
Please say I graduated.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.729
[Wagner] Do good things, okay?

50:23.812 --> 50:25.814
I will. It ain't like I'm going
across the country,

50:25.897 --> 50:28.567
-I'm three hours away.
-It ain't like we're getting deported.

50:28.650 --> 50:30.068
I know. I'm gonna miss you.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.987
-I got FaceTime.
-I'm gonna be, like, 20 minutes from here.

50:32.070 --> 50:33.655
-Work hard.
-Always.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.908
Time to get to this money, now.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.618
Work hard, play harder.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.203
[chuckles] In that order.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.747
-In that order.
-Not necessarily.

50:41.830 --> 50:43.331
Yeah, in that order.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.208
-I'm gone.
-All right.

50:46.376 --> 50:48.462
-Bye, Wyatt.
-I'll see you.

50:49.129 --> 50:51.089
Tight, tight schedule to get out of here.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.717
Ten-four. And watch.
Watch this, as I leave.

51:00.432 --> 51:02.017
Be safe, please.

51:02.100 --> 51:04.144
Yeah, you know.
I'm always good.

51:10.108 --> 51:11.526
[smacks lips]

51:13.904 --> 51:15.447
You better not cry, come on.

51:15.530 --> 51:18.074
Stand up.
Give me my hug.

51:20.035 --> 51:21.203
And, uh...

51:23.163 --> 51:27.125
Come on, come on. Come on.

51:29.294 --> 51:30.504
[groans]

51:31.463 --> 51:33.256
-Thank you.

51:41.097 --> 51:43.099
-[Ollie] Yeah.

51:43.183 --> 51:44.267
[Ollie chuckles]

51:44.351 --> 51:46.770
And I want you to do great things.

51:47.979 --> 51:49.022
Okay?

51:49.105 --> 51:51.066
-Yes, ma'am.
-I expect that from you.

51:51.149 --> 51:52.943

51:53.026 --> 51:54.194

51:54.277 --> 51:56.029
[Wagner] Okay.
[Ollie] You hear me?

51:56.112 --> 51:58.990
[grunts and chuckles]

51:59.074 --> 52:00.784
-[Wagner] I love you.
-I love you, too.

52:00.867 --> 52:02.452

52:03.537 --> 52:06.748

52:06.832 --> 52:08.375
-I'mma call you this weekend.
-Okay.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.543

52:11.169 --> 52:12.754

-Oh, really?

52:12.838 --> 52:15.048
Well... I ain't out of here till Friday!

52:15.131 --> 52:16.383
[Ollie chuckles]

52:23.181 --> 52:25.308
-[player] Where you at?
-[sniffling]

52:26.768 --> 52:28.395
[player] It's gonna be all right.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.575
Hey, had fun playing with ya, boy.

52:43.410 --> 52:45.537
-Oh, you ain't gonna tell yet?
-I'm gonna tell everybody.

52:45.620 --> 52:47.455
-Can I come with you?
-Yeah.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.334
I was waiting on you,
but you didn't, so we--

52:53.795 --> 52:55.171
[inaudible]

53:22.490 --> 53:24.159
[Buddy] <i>The big thing in recruiting...</i>

53:25.160 --> 53:29.873
<i>is trying to see through some of the bull.</i>

53:29.956 --> 53:32.667
<i>People wanna be in your life</i>
<i>for one of two reasons.</i>

53:32.751 --> 53:34.961
<i>They either love you</i>
<i>or they want something from you.</i>

53:38.548 --> 53:41.593
{\an8}I watched you,
and then I heard your story.

53:41.676 --> 53:46.056
And I said, "Guys, this guy...
this kid is looking for a family.

53:46.139 --> 53:48.016
He's looking for a family
to be a part of."

53:48.099 --> 53:50.518
We hope that you guys, uh,
join the family.

53:50.602 --> 53:53.772
That's, that's big for us.
Uh, as a parent, you know,

53:53.855 --> 53:56.608
I have three daughters.
I remember I told you that.

53:57.150 --> 53:58.902
That's my three daughters.

53:58.985 --> 54:02.405
Rebecca, Julianna, Lauren.
She goes to Mississippi State.

54:02.489 --> 54:05.784
This is not about me.
It's not about East Mississippi.

54:05.867 --> 54:07.494
It's about you and this family.

54:07.577 --> 54:10.664
And this is not about me.
This is about you.

54:10.747 --> 54:13.249
You have so many people
that throw rocks and stones.

54:13.333 --> 54:15.710
You know, people are always
looking to knock us off.

54:15.794 --> 54:18.338
They don't know us.
They just know we win.

54:18.421 --> 54:22.384
And we beat people to sleep.
I mean, we really do.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.386
It's not about the football.
It's about the academics.

54:24.469 --> 54:25.595
It's about him getting a degree.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.640
I'm not even worried about football.
I'm worried about getting that degree.

54:28.723 --> 54:30.433
You may not think
it's a very big decision,

54:30.517 --> 54:33.436
but the decision that you make
is gonna directly affect

54:33.520 --> 54:37.023
where you go to college,
what kind of job you get...

54:37.107 --> 54:40.068
Is this it? Is this it?

54:40.151 --> 54:42.487
Now, here's the thing, now.

54:42.570 --> 54:44.072
I want this to be it.

54:44.155 --> 54:46.908
If it's not it, I wanna know.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.744
This is how I feed my family now. Okay?

54:49.828 --> 54:53.415
And this is something that I take
very, very seriously. Are you sure?
