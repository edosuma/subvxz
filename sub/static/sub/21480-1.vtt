WEBVTT

00:00.833 --> 00:03.066
Previously on the 4400...

00:03.121 --> 00:04.623
A comet cannot change course.

00:04.653 --> 00:06.532
- This one has.
- Then it's not a comet.

00:08.199 --> 00:09.836
We're not sure what's just happened.

00:09.852 --> 00:11.752
There appears to be something out there.

00:11.775 --> 00:15.264
The light is gone, and thousands
of people have just suddenly appeared.

00:15.284 --> 00:17.531
Diana Skouris. Tom Baldwin.

00:17.929 --> 00:22.203
You two will be one of the teams that's responsible
for investigating what happened to the returnees.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.511
We're letting them go.

00:23.530 --> 00:24.662
We're letting them go ?

00:24.680 --> 00:26.178
We don't have a legal right to hold them.

00:26.201 --> 00:29.865
Why disappear a little girl from the 1940s,
hold her for 60 years,

00:29.888 --> 00:32.072
and then send her back with the ability
to predict the future ?

00:32.104 --> 00:33.572
- Can i go home ?
- Home ?

00:33.595 --> 00:35.861
With you. I don't like
being here alone.

00:35.896 --> 00:37.133
Shawn Farrell...

00:37.183 --> 00:38.949
Uncle Tommy. Hi.

00:38.985 --> 00:39.877
He's all yours.

00:39.912 --> 00:41.157
Hey, what about Kyle ?

00:41.180 --> 00:42.622
Kyle's in a coma, Shawn.

00:45.718 --> 00:46.788
What the hell did you do to Kyle ?

00:46.823 --> 00:49.896
I don't know what happened.
I put my hands on him. That's it.

00:49.943 --> 00:50.871
He woke up.

00:50.895 --> 00:53.325
You're talking about some kind of ripple effect.

00:53.349 --> 00:55.215
Diana Skouris to the head of the class.

00:55.251 --> 00:58.644
The incidents themselves are just catalysts for change.

00:58.679 --> 01:01.037
I swear to god.
I'll ask you one more time...

01:01.072 --> 01:02.246
Where's my son ?

01:02.269 --> 01:03.608
- Kyle ! Kyle !
- No !

01:03.631 --> 01:04.782
Tom, don't !

01:07.506 --> 01:09.631
You're not my son.
Who are you ? What are you ?

01:09.655 --> 01:12.166
I'm human. I come from a different time.
Your future.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.092
In my time, humanity is dying out.

01:14.127 --> 01:16.886
Only those we took can prevent the catastrophe from happening.

01:16.922 --> 01:19.716
That's why they've been altered
and seeded back into the timeline.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.252
You mean it's all going to end ?

01:21.288 --> 01:23.331
- You have to help them.
- Help them ? How ?

01:25.644 --> 01:26.383
Dad ?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.229
Kyle...

01:27.684 --> 01:31.207
I intend to provide a safe haven
for any 4400 in this country who needs one.

01:31.242 --> 01:33.132
You goddamn freak !

01:33.156 --> 01:34.165
Danny, stop it !

01:34.200 --> 01:35.398
Stop blaming me for nikki !

01:35.422 --> 01:38.357
I guess what i'm asking is if i could stay here for awhile.

01:38.378 --> 01:40.691
Tell me a little more about this...ability of yours.

01:40.727 --> 01:44.543
I wasn't pregnant when i was abducted,
but i was when i got back.

01:44.561 --> 01:48.339
That baby could be the key to the future,
and it has to be protected, and i can do that.

01:51.968 --> 01:53.013
Go ahead ! Run !

01:53.036 --> 01:55.759
I will find you.
That baby belongs with me.

Isabelle...

02:12.694 --> 02:13.516
Isabelle...

02:28.350 --> 02:29.571
What is it, baby ?

02:31.072 --> 02:32.352
Bad dream ?

02:34.653 --> 02:35.722
Same one.

02:39.761 --> 02:41.111
She's fine, richard.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.312
We're all fine.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.091
Come back to bed.

02:54.922 --> 02:56.683
It's probably just a raccoon...

03:18.814 --> 03:19.777
Who was it ?

03:21.374 --> 03:23.652
They took off before i could ask.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.849
They left something behind.

03:31.826 --> 03:33.528
Someone tracked us down.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.474
Who ?

03:35.495 --> 03:37.409
NTAC ?
Collier ?

03:37.480 --> 03:39.335
This look like their calling card to you ?

03:39.382 --> 03:42.411
I don't know who it is,
but someone knows we're 4400s.

03:45.407 --> 03:47.145
Start packing.

03:47.391 --> 03:50.726
I'll drive into town tomorrow morning to pick up
my last paycheck, and then we're out of here.

03:50.749 --> 03:51.944
Can't we just go now ?

03:51.979 --> 03:53.834
We're gonna need that money, Lily.

04:07.835 --> 04:09.479
Mr. and Mrs. Sumlin.

04:09.526 --> 04:12.144
Peter.
If you'll follow me.

04:14.412 --> 04:15.845
Forgive our appearance.

04:15.868 --> 04:18.733
As you know,
the Center doesn't officially open until tomorrow.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.377
Peter doesn't have time to wait.

04:20.423 --> 04:22.514
That's where you're wrong, Mrs. Sumlin.

04:24.950 --> 04:27.780
Peter has all the time in the world.

04:30.128 --> 04:31.256
Hi, peter.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.287
My name is Jordan Collier.

04:35.741 --> 04:37.267
Just this way.

04:38.477 --> 04:40.790
Our medical lab isn't quite ready,

04:40.825 --> 04:43.490
so we thought Peter would be more comfortable up here.

04:46.836 --> 04:47.892
Hello, Peter.

04:48.303 --> 04:49.489
I'm Shawn.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.006
What do you say we get started ?

04:55.335 --> 04:56.133
Yeah ?

04:56.873 --> 04:57.859
Okay, buddy.

04:58.587 --> 05:00.137
I want you to take my hands.

05:03.816 --> 05:05.295
Try to relax.

05:05.695 --> 05:06.446
Okay ?

05:18.830 --> 05:20.227
You're okay.

05:20.568 --> 05:23.104
You're doing good. You're doing so good.
It's okay.

05:23.844 --> 05:26.021
Oh, my god. Is he okay ?

05:26.068 --> 05:27.090
He's fine.

05:27.512 --> 05:28.933
Just watch.

05:29.826 --> 05:30.953
It's okay.

05:32.902 --> 05:34.839
You're okay. You're okay.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.830
Peter ?

06:00.652 --> 06:01.990
How do you feel, honey ?

06:02.013 --> 06:02.894
Son ?

06:20.681 --> 06:21.644
Thank you

06:21.902 --> 06:23.640
for  your generous donation.

06:23.746 --> 06:26.810
We tried everything.
Radiation, bone marrow transplants...

06:26.845 --> 06:28.569
Is he really cured ?

06:28.592 --> 06:31.434
Take him back to his doctor.
Run some tests.

06:31.469 --> 06:33.441
Peter's leukemia is gone.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.968
This is a miracle.

06:35.015 --> 06:37.056
For  now, it has to remain a private miracle.

06:37.079 --> 06:39.578
May i remind you that the confidentiality agreement

06:39.639 --> 06:41.298
you've signed is strictly binding.

06:41.365 --> 06:43.324
But people should know about that young man.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.603
And they will.

06:44.944 --> 06:46.095
In time,

06:46.752 --> 06:48.196
they'll know everything.

06:49.535 --> 06:50.662
Very nice.

06:50.862 --> 06:53.008
Floating the five. Floating the five.

06:55.521 --> 06:57.382
- You nervous ?
- Aren't you ?

06:57.769 --> 06:59.214
No, not at all.

07:00.329 --> 07:01.550
Well, maybe a little bit.

07:03.197 --> 07:04.477
Okay. A lot.

07:04.923 --> 07:06.884
Now, you really want to do this, right ?

07:06.919 --> 07:07.741
Right.

07:09.702 --> 07:10.747
Let's go. Okay.

07:11.663 --> 07:15.759
Says here she registered an ability
under the dinstman-lenhoff bill.

07:15.796 --> 07:18.250
Some kind of precognitive insight ?

07:18.802 --> 07:22.146
Yes, her visions stopped about four months ago.
We're not sure why.

07:22.357 --> 07:23.508
Oh, too bad.

07:23.555 --> 07:27.277
I was going to ask if Teledex will hit its quarterly projection.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.831
Well, we'd like to get started, if that's all right.

07:30.878 --> 07:31.793
Certainly.

07:31.899 --> 07:33.731
If you'll just sign where indicated.

07:35.504 --> 07:39.425
Diana Skouris,
Your adoption of maia rutledge is hereby complete,

07:39.464 --> 07:41.624
Legal, and binding.

07:42.141 --> 07:44.307
So witnessed by me, Henry Biederman,

07:44.346 --> 07:47.190
10th circuit family court of Seattle.

07:47.930 --> 07:52.230
You know, some of us have to look far and wide
to find the people we'll call "family."

07:52.606 --> 07:55.095
You two had to look clear across time.

07:56.446 --> 07:58.982
Diana, let me introduce you t
o your daughter Maia.

07:59.992 --> 08:01.571
Maia, say hello to mommy.

08:15.282 --> 08:16.444
I'm not doing it.

08:16.479 --> 08:17.900
I mean it this time. No way.

08:17.935 --> 08:20.448
It's just a cat scan, Kyle.
You've had them before.

08:20.472 --> 08:24.185
This one's gonna tell them the same thing
the last 150 told them... nothing.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.628
There's nobody in here but me.

08:26.661 --> 08:27.745
I know that,

08:27.828 --> 08:30.152
and sooner or later,
they're going to stop looking.

08:30.995 --> 08:32.530
When ? When ?

08:33.094 --> 08:34.409
I wish i knew,

08:34.445 --> 08:38.272
But with NTAC, the Government, they've got
bigger issues than you or me, okay ? Just...

08:38.989 --> 08:43.308
Kyle, they're still trying to make sense about what
happened that night at Highland Beach. That's all.

08:43.918 --> 08:47.816
They're afraid if they let me out
I'm gonna spill the beans about their big secret ?

08:48.216 --> 08:50.458
Well, they can relax,
because i just want to get out of here

08:50.493 --> 08:53.065
and be normal again,
and normal people don't go around

08:53.100 --> 08:56.176
sounding off about future humans
and the end of the world.

08:56.212 --> 08:58.806
Besides, I don't even remember what happened.

09:00.379 --> 09:01.295
I know.

09:01.565 --> 09:04.134
You listening ?
I don't remember !

09:04.181 --> 09:05.687
Just calm down. Just calm down.

09:05.697 --> 09:06.332
Dad,

09:06.377 --> 09:07.891
get me out of here.

09:08.455 --> 09:10.615
Talk to someone. Anyone.
Please, 'cause...

09:10.660 --> 09:12.809
Shh. Okay, okay.
Okay

09:15.157 --> 09:15.932
Okay.

09:16.766 --> 09:17.621
Okay.

09:25.734 --> 09:26.532
Tom.

09:29.456 --> 09:30.724
Been awhile, huh ?

09:31.828 --> 09:33.436
Yeah, you know how it is.

09:33.613 --> 09:37.344
Us desk jockeys don't have much cause
to mingle with you hot-shot field agents.

09:37.919 --> 09:40.350
Someone feeling a little sorry for himself today ?

09:40.385 --> 09:42.627
"The path to oblivion starts here."

09:43.860 --> 09:47.415
The 4400 were sent back to save humanity,
and i'm supposed to help them.

09:47.439 --> 09:49.576
I was there on the beach, remember ?

09:49.624 --> 09:51.327
They gave me a mission,

09:52.419 --> 09:54.767
and what's my biggest accomplishment of the week ?

09:55.824 --> 09:58.584
I convinced my son to take another cat scan.

09:59.735 --> 10:02.036
Somehow, I don't think that's what they had in mind.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.938
Diana, you ready to roll ?

10:04.678 --> 10:05.617
In a minute.

10:05.641 --> 10:07.561
It's just we have to check in on three more returnees.

10:07.596 --> 10:09.956
I want to make sure we get our reports in by 5:00.

10:10.003 --> 10:12.915
Okay, why don't you keep the car warmed up ?
And i'll be right there.

10:13.631 --> 10:14.535
You bet.

10:20.793 --> 10:23.728
Vic Hubbard's the best lead investigator you could find ?

10:23.767 --> 10:27.078
Oh, no, he's the fourth one this year.
Two more, I break a record.

10:28.851 --> 10:31.376
We've  got to get you out from behind that desk.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.830
I'm lucky to have a job here.

10:33.865 --> 10:35.765
I put a gun to another agent's head, remember ?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.700
Yeah, well,
I never said it was going to be easy.

10:41.589 --> 10:42.798
It's obvious what really happened.

10:42.831 --> 10:45.050
Are you going to start in with your negative energy again ?

10:45.074 --> 10:46.741
White holes. See, they're the answer.

10:46.765 --> 10:48.761
That's how they took them,
and that's how they brought them back.

10:48.820 --> 10:51.845
- Yeah, but white holes... the second law of...
- Yeah, because I'm right.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.796
Come on, come on.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.490
- Guys !
- What's it like to not be right ?

10:54.663 --> 10:55.908
Am I interrupting ?

10:57.810 --> 11:00.062
Brady's back on his "white hole" kick again.

11:00.097 --> 11:03.338
Well, one day you'll explain to me the difference
between the white ones and the black ones, right ?

11:03.385 --> 11:05.228
Well, how about tonight ?

11:06.860 --> 11:09.406
How about you just give me that thing that we discussed ?

11:09.429 --> 11:10.967
- Can't.
- Why not ?

11:11.343 --> 11:12.916
I already sent it upstairs.

11:14.501 --> 11:16.310
I wonder if anyone's read it yet.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.195
When they do, I'm sure you'll hear about it.

11:20.886 --> 11:22.283
I owe you one, handsome.

12:07.010 --> 12:09.029
H. P. Lovecraft's

12:09.429 --> 12:11.731
The Mountains of Madness.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.911
Are you trying to tell me something ?

12:20.383 --> 12:22.179
Which orderly did you steal it from ?

12:22.907 --> 12:23.788
Matt ?

12:24.328 --> 12:25.150
Arlo ?

12:29.703 --> 12:31.148
You're so sweet.

12:32.733 --> 12:35.162
You're the only person here
who doesn't want me dead.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.782
I wish I could take you with me when I go,
but I can't.

12:43.968 --> 12:45.589
They  only want me.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.239
But I'll be leaving soon.

12:52.129 --> 12:53.207
Very soon.

13:14.841 --> 13:16.191
Joanne  ? Paul ?

13:17.553 --> 13:18.669
What are you doing ?

13:19.244 --> 13:22.614
Sex maniac.
Don't go flashing those bedroom eyes at me.

13:22.649 --> 13:24.549
Joanne, I'm serious.

13:24.819 --> 13:27.038
Put that stuff down before you hurt yourself.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.506
We're building something.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.138
I can see that.

13:30.302 --> 13:31.465
Can you really ?

13:33.047 --> 13:34.726
It's gonna be gigantic.

13:34.761 --> 13:37.168
Humongous.
Rival the pyramids.

13:37.439 --> 13:40.045
But some things are better left to the imagination, Joanne.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.090
Besides,

13:41.135 --> 13:42.932
you two have physical therapy now.

13:45.996 --> 13:47.358
Let's go.

13:48.462 --> 13:49.622
Building something...

13:51.172 --> 13:52.417
Building nothing.

13:52.511 --> 13:54.025
Help me get rid of this junk.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.202
I'm sorry. Too hard ?

14:40.255 --> 14:41.664
Oh, no. Hey,

14:41.828 --> 14:43.625
go ahead.
Give it your best shot.

14:45.527 --> 14:47.934
Whatever you do, you must be pretty good at it.

14:48.474 --> 14:51.103
Uh, yeah, I work with my hands.
Same as you.

14:51.138 --> 14:53.557
My apartment doesn't look anything like this.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.293
Well, it helps to have friends in high places.

14:57.138 --> 14:59.569
I'm always open to making new friends.

15:03.214 --> 15:04.353
Come in.

15:06.032 --> 15:07.441
Speak of the devil.

15:08.004 --> 15:09.049
Give us a moment.

15:16.563 --> 15:19.287
Has anyone ever told you your timing sucks ?

15:19.616 --> 15:22.342
If they did, I probably fired them.
For you.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.363
Oh...

15:23.434 --> 15:25.136
It's in bookstores tomorrow.

15:26.604 --> 15:29.715
Jordan, this is gonna sell, like, a million copies.

15:29.736 --> 15:31.650
People are gonna freak out when they read this.

15:31.697 --> 15:34.491
Big ideas make a loud noise when they land, Shawn.

15:55.456 --> 15:57.100
You wanted to see me, Nina ?

16:01.773 --> 16:03.344
Are you sleeping with Tom Baldwin ?

16:05.093 --> 16:07.442
Should I come back in ?
Maybe we could start over...

16:07.489 --> 16:08.768
Answer the question.

16:10.401 --> 16:12.185
Never even held hands.

16:12.855 --> 16:14.019
Do you owe him money ?

16:14.054 --> 16:16.044
Okay, what game are we playing here ?
Because if I knew the rules...

16:16.062 --> 16:17.917
I am playing the theory room paper game.

16:17.940 --> 16:20.089
- I don't know that one.
- Well, let me give you a hint.

16:20.693 --> 16:25.269
"The necessity for the immediate reassignment
of Thomas Baldwin to active field duty."

16:25.833 --> 16:26.784
Catchy title.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.731
Did you come up with it yourself,
or did the big brains in the basement pitch in ?

16:29.755 --> 16:32.056
Let's just say that I agree with the sentiment.

16:32.314 --> 16:35.567
Tom is the best agent i've ever worked with,
maybe the best you've got in this division.

16:35.589 --> 16:38.525
In the three months that baldwin was investigating the 4400,

16:38.560 --> 16:42.047
this department learned more, far more,
than it has in the entire year

16:42.071 --> 16:43.597
he's been shuffling paper.

16:43.609 --> 16:45.075
He threatened another agent's life.

16:45.110 --> 16:49.055
He was trying to protect his son,
who these future people, whoever they are,

16:49.090 --> 16:50.640
chose as their spokesman.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.817
That's not to mention that his nephew Shawn is one of the 4400.

16:53.841 --> 16:56.130
All of which sound like major conflicts of interest to me.

16:56.165 --> 16:57.645
That's not what Dennis Ryland believed.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.744
Dennis Ryland is no longer in charge here.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.470
Maybe you should call Washington and talk to him.

17:01.505 --> 17:04.686
I don't have to call washington.
They've got me on speed dial.

17:04.804 --> 17:08.198
Congressmen, senators,
committee chairs, subcommittee chairs,

17:08.233 --> 17:10.992
all of them looking to this department, to me,
for answers.

17:11.050 --> 17:14.372
Which is why you can't keep an agent
like Tom Baldwin on the shelf.

17:14.395 --> 17:17.694
He's a major player in this case.
He's maybe the major player.

17:17.718 --> 17:20.313
See, funny, that's exactly what it says in this paper.

17:22.123 --> 17:24.329
Maybe Marco had me check it for typos.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.310
Uh, the next time that you want to send me a message,

17:29.109 --> 17:30.131
put your own name on it.

17:41.378 --> 17:42.646
Mr. Walcott !

17:42.752 --> 17:44.161
Get down from there !

17:44.842 --> 17:46.204
Arlo !

17:46.439 --> 17:48.728
Mr. Walcott, get down from there !

17:49.163 --> 17:51.229
Arlo !
You heard the man !

17:51.746 --> 17:54.588
Mr. Walcott,
Get down from there this instant !

17:55.856 --> 17:58.287
I'm calling security if you don't come down right now.

18:01.093 --> 18:02.065
Arlo !

18:02.958 --> 18:04.637
This is your last chance.

18:07.408 --> 18:09.098
What the hell are you doing up there ?

18:09.779 --> 18:10.845
I got it.

18:11.702 --> 18:12.606
Arlo !

18:13.041 --> 18:14.978
Arlo, this is your last warning.

18:16.904 --> 18:17.749
Arlo, please !

18:18.264 --> 18:19.426
Be careful !

18:20.142 --> 18:21.528
I'm coming down.

18:21.857 --> 18:23.935
Arlo, be careful !

18:23.958 --> 18:25.391
Watch what you're doing.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.192
I got it.

18:28.509 --> 18:29.742
I got it.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.544
Oh, oh... oh, my god.
Oh, my god !

18:42.084 --> 18:42.965
No !

19:07.199 --> 19:08.737
Lily, I'm home.

19:09.905 --> 19:11.655
Lily, relax.
We don't have to leave.

19:12.019 --> 19:15.658
Some nut papered the entire town with these things.
He wasn't singling us out.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.948
Well, I still think we should go.

19:19.322 --> 19:21.142
I was scared last night too,

19:21.189 --> 19:22.762
but did you read this ?

19:22.809 --> 19:24.533
It's a rant, not a witch hunt.

19:25.014 --> 19:26.576
Maybe, but Richard,

19:26.869 --> 19:29.018
we still don't feel safe here anymore.

19:29.370 --> 19:31.425
You mean Isabelle doesn't feel safe.

19:31.892 --> 19:34.581
Richard, we've gone over this a dozen times.

19:35.637 --> 19:37.810
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.

19:37.833 --> 19:38.749
"talks ?"

19:39.524 --> 19:41.765
Communicates.
Whatever.

19:43.373 --> 19:45.592
Did she happen to mention where we should go ?

19:46.026 --> 19:48.855
Does she have a place picked out,
or will she know it when she sees it ?

19:49.383 --> 19:50.593
We can find a town.

19:50.616 --> 19:52.213
We already did. Right here.

19:53.082 --> 19:55.167
Isabelle is six months old.

19:55.190 --> 19:57.821
I know she's a special kid,
but we're still her parents.

19:58.901 --> 20:01.531
We make decisions for her.
She doesn't make them for us.

20:16.631 --> 20:19.449
I know. It's time
we get out of here. You're right.

20:19.496 --> 20:21.469
You're absolutely right.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.012
We're staying put.

20:37.276 --> 20:38.321
Maia ?

20:42.948 --> 20:43.956
Party time.

20:46.927 --> 20:51.001
Macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes,
and white bread.

20:51.036 --> 20:52.537
Everything I like.

20:52.771 --> 20:57.550
The only things you'll eat. You've got to promise me
that you'll outgrow this phase soon.

21:03.495 --> 21:06.501
Mommy, how do you make this taste so good ?

21:07.170 --> 21:09.190
Well, it's a hidden talent, I guess.

21:10.528 --> 21:12.595
You just called me "mommy."

21:12.638 --> 21:14.552
You're my mom now, right ?

21:16.865 --> 21:18.615
Now and forever.

21:19.049 --> 21:21.316
- I like that.
- Me too.

21:22.325 --> 21:24.882
So do you think i'll ever go back to school ?

21:26.056 --> 21:29.790
Weren't you just telling me you got,
like, a 97 on your math test ?

21:29.837 --> 21:32.338
Not home-school.
Real school,

21:33.066 --> 21:35.791
With a playground, and recess.

21:36.037 --> 21:37.493
Well, sure you will...

21:37.529 --> 21:39.090
You know, when you get a bit older.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.475
How much older ?

21:40.534 --> 21:43.198
I'm not seeing things that are going to happen anymore,

21:43.609 --> 21:46.486
So it should be ok for me to be around other kids.

21:47.026 --> 21:49.175
I think I'd be happy at school.

21:50.043 --> 21:51.488
Well, you're happy now.

21:51.664 --> 21:53.651
I'm glad you're my mom for real,

21:53.921 --> 21:58.300
- but could I still use a, like a friend or two.
- ahh...

22:04.054 --> 22:05.768
More mac' and cheese, please.

22:11.906 --> 22:13.081
Just a little.

22:23.376 --> 22:24.503
Sign this.

22:25.419 --> 22:26.440
What is it ?

22:26.487 --> 22:28.155
Your letter of resignation.

22:30.395 --> 22:32.109
I thought I was being reassigned to field duty.

22:32.144 --> 22:33.072
You are

22:33.121 --> 22:34.459
Effective immediately.

22:35.903 --> 22:37.359
I need results.

22:37.383 --> 22:40.312
We have a high-priced collection of sheepskin in the basement

22:40.359 --> 22:42.343
that tells me you're the best way to get them.

22:42.390 --> 22:43.952
So i'm willing to take a risk.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.215
But I need some insurance.

22:46.767 --> 22:47.518
This.

22:48.041 --> 22:49.509
I left the date blank.

22:49.732 --> 22:51.763
You cross the line, I fill it in.

22:56.871 --> 22:57.763
Fair enough.

23:01.116 --> 23:01.938
Good.

23:03.546 --> 23:05.190
Here. Look at this.

23:06.587 --> 23:07.750
Tess Doerner.

23:08.078 --> 23:10.906
Diagnose of paranoïd schizophrenia at the age of 15.

23:10.930 --> 23:14.546
Disapeared from Abendson Psychiatric Hospital in April of 1955.

23:14.582 --> 23:17.047
Let me guess, they sent her back without bothering to cure her ?

23:17.082 --> 23:19.208
Curing people was not part of their agenda.

23:19.608 --> 23:22.015
We just got a call from the C. A. over the hospital.

23:22.056 --> 23:23.506
One  of their orderlies is dead.

23:23.541 --> 23:25.946
He claims that there's some kind of connection.

23:26.694 --> 23:27.901
We'll check it out.

23:28.805 --> 23:29.838
Hold on.

23:30.966 --> 23:33.496
There's still one piece of business we need to get straight.

23:35.234 --> 23:36.866
You're setting conditions ?

23:48.404 --> 23:49.977
This is your new house ?

23:50.353 --> 23:51.605
It's yours too.

24:10.229 --> 24:12.060
Well, all your stuff is here. I...

24:12.824 --> 24:14.550
Kind of looks like your old place, huh ?

24:16.345 --> 24:18.024
Well, I tried, anyway.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.472
Only one thing missing,

24:24.024 --> 24:25.011
Mom.

24:27.422 --> 24:30.510
Yeah I know. Sometimes I can't believe she's not here either.

24:31.367 --> 24:33.105
But we tried, Kyle, you know, we...

24:33.257 --> 24:34.566
we really tried to make it work.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.929
I wish you both would have tried a little harder.

24:38.049 --> 24:39.326
I'm sorry, it's just...

24:39.986 --> 24:41.810
You know, when something terrible happens to a family,

24:41.811 --> 24:44.011
like when you were in the hospital, it can...

24:44.832 --> 24:46.989
bring people closer together or...

24:47.591 --> 24:49.587
drive them apart. Your mom and me...

24:50.996 --> 24:53.843
I'll have to call her, let her know I’m out the quarantine.

24:54.149 --> 24:56.189
Yeah, you should do that. You know, it'd make her really happy...

24:56.233 --> 24:58.214
Shawn is gonna freak out too.

24:58.772 --> 25:00.548
What ? You know I’m gonna see him, right ?

25:00.577 --> 25:01.839
You're a good cousin.

25:02.045 --> 25:04.834
Just don't expect too much. You know, people change in four years.

25:13.088 --> 25:15.627
I can't believe you're standing here. I...

25:15.950 --> 25:18.357
I've been looking forward to this moment for too long.

25:21.372 --> 25:22.561
Hey...

25:23.030 --> 25:25.393
You remember how we used to love to go to the batting cages ?

25:26.010 --> 25:27.771
You never could hit that curve ball.

25:27.815 --> 25:29.430
Me ? No, it was you,

25:29.488 --> 25:31.044
And I got plenty of quarters saved up, so...

25:31.088 --> 25:33.715
Maybe we should stop off at the driving range too.

25:34.631 --> 25:36.539
You want to learn how to play golf ?

25:37.082 --> 25:38.828
I used to beg to teach you !

25:39.401 --> 25:41.632
Lot of things I want to try now, dad.

25:44.464 --> 25:46.813
You make a list. You want it, and we'll do it.

25:46.886 --> 25:47.900
Anything.

25:49.294 --> 25:50.982
You can show me tonight, okay ?

25:51.158 --> 25:53.066
You're leaving ? I just got here !

25:53.095 --> 25:54.871
That's my job, buddy.

25:54.945 --> 25:56.853
Now, get started on that list.

26:01.918 --> 26:05.367
You people really take your arts and crafts seriously, don't you ?

26:05.411 --> 26:08.009
You're sure Tess drew this before they started building ?

26:08.640 --> 26:11.282
Ske made her first sketch 2 weeks ago.

26:11.719 --> 26:13.806
That thing started going up yesterday.

26:13.833 --> 26:17.076
And you think that the orderly who died is connected to all of this ?

26:17.106 --> 26:19.983
Arlo was on the ledge of "B" building prying loose a weather vane.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.549
I believe it was this weather vane.

26:26.488 --> 26:28.851
So why don't you just confine all the other patients to their rooms ?

26:28.909 --> 26:32.711
Well, i've been tempted, but this kind of cooperative behavior, it's unheard of with these illnesses.

26:32.740 --> 26:36.204
Besides, I wanted you to get a look at that thing before we tore it down again.

26:37.066 --> 26:38.842
It's all right, Kevin.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.927
They're just here to talk to Tess.

26:42.057 --> 26:43.950
He's very protective of her.

26:44.067 --> 26:46.122
She's his only friend in here.

26:47.722 --> 26:49.204
Really, it's okay.

26:59.121 --> 27:00.721
I'll just let her know you're coming.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.631
Great.

27:12.345 --> 27:16.058
We saw some of the pictures you did, Tess. They're really good.

27:16.484 --> 27:17.993
They'll hear you.

27:18.683 --> 27:20.826
There's microphones in the walls.

27:21.487 --> 27:24.437
They broadcast by sattellite to the submarines.

27:24.627 --> 27:25.611
Who does ?

27:26.946 --> 27:28.238
The doctors.

27:28.810 --> 27:30.817
The doctors here in the hospital ?

27:32.490 --> 27:34.442
Some of them are in the hospital.

27:34.619 --> 27:36.938
Some of them are stationed on the submarine.

27:37.202 --> 27:39.800
All right, we'll just talk really softly.

27:42.164 --> 27:44.805
They took my crayons away, but they're too late.

27:44.894 --> 27:46.214
Yeah ? Why's that ?

27:46.391 --> 27:48.886
Because it's gonna get built anyway.

27:49.443 --> 27:53.450
They want me to get in touch with them, that's why they put the plans in my head.

27:54.815 --> 27:58.778
Huh, now, are we talking about the doctors here in the hospital or the doctors

27:58.807 --> 28:00.128
under the sea ?

28:01.566 --> 28:02.726
Neither

28:03.328 --> 28:05.940
We're talking about the people who took me...

28:05.970 --> 28:07.276
...stupid.

28:12.867 --> 28:15.626
So the people who took you...

28:15.670 --> 28:19.178
they want the patients here to build that tower ?

28:19.325 --> 28:21.394
They'll do anything to get me back.

28:22.612 --> 28:24.054
They like me.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.229
Did you ask the other patients for help, Tess ?

28:34.210 --> 28:36.177
I don't like talking t them.

28:36.985 --> 28:38.321
They're crazy.

28:39.921 --> 28:41.462
Was Arlo crazy ?

28:45.058 --> 28:46.848
I never thought he was...

28:49.578 --> 28:51.720
but maybe crazy is catching.

28:54.039 --> 28:56.094
So my first day back, and what's going on ?

28:56.138 --> 28:57.048
Nothing much.

28:57.092 --> 29:00.923
Just a bunch of mental patients building a machine to contact the future.

29:01.155 --> 29:02.960
Well, that's what Tess thinks, anyway

29:03.019 --> 29:05.793
She also thinks there are doctors stationed under the pacific ocean,

29:05.837 --> 29:08.772
listening to a radio broadcast of her private conversations.

29:08.801 --> 29:12.265
Could be some kind of collective hysteria. Doesn't explain this guy Arlo, though.

29:12.324 --> 29:16.165
He's a middle-aged hospital orderly whose wife just left him. It could have been suicide.

29:16.194 --> 29:19.394
Lost his nerve at the last minute, tried to grab the weather vane ?

29:19.922 --> 29:22.124
I wonder how long it is since marco got some sun, you know ?

29:22.153 --> 29:24.751
I was thinking we could bring him down to have a look at that thing they're building.

29:24.795 --> 29:26.028
A road trip for Marco ?

29:26.057 --> 29:27.698
He goes outside, Tom,

29:27.742 --> 29:29.885
but, you know, we could have some sunblock handy.

29:29.929 --> 29:31.441
It would be something, though, huh ?

29:31.485 --> 29:34.259
If she could actually do it. Contact the future.

29:34.376 --> 29:35.829
Tess is right.

29:36.193 --> 29:38.351
Maybe crazy is catching.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.228
He was dictating a letter.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.944
I don't know what happened. He just grabbed his head and started screaming.

29:51.399 --> 29:53.131
Wait outside. Now.

29:53.938 --> 29:55.435
Hold still. Hold still.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.139
Thanks. Thank you.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.807
They're getting worse.

30:22.895 --> 30:24.084
Jordan...

30:24.245 --> 30:26.332
They're coming more often too.

30:27.931 --> 30:29.340
- You're okay ?
- I'm fine

30:30.911 --> 30:34.228
I don't get it. I don't get why these attacks keep coming back.

30:35.901 --> 30:37.541
I've cured...

30:37.585 --> 30:39.787
emphysema, leukemia...

30:40.271 --> 30:41.343
broken bones...

30:43.691 --> 30:45.438
That baby really kicked your ass.

30:45.467 --> 30:47.565
Well, you just remember that when we find Richard and Lily.

30:47.589 --> 30:51.520
You sound pretty confident, Jordan, but it's been a year.

30:52.580 --> 30:55.034
Sometimes I forget they're still out there.

30:55.057 --> 30:56.454
I never forget,

30:57.229 --> 30:59.648
and neither do the men I'm paying to find them.

31:02.466 --> 31:04.304
Okay, but if I were you,

31:04.950 --> 31:08.003
I wouldn't want to be in the same time zone as that kid.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.234
If you two meet up again,

31:11.138 --> 31:13.284
it might just finish you off.

31:14.365 --> 31:15.879
I have my reasons.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.556
- Now, get some rest, okay ?
- Allright.

31:30.767 --> 31:32.118
Big day tomorrow.

31:40.529 --> 31:41.715
<i>In the breaking news,</i>

31:41.997 --> 31:45.660
<i>revelation about the origins of the 4400.</i>

31:45.833 --> 31:48.020
<i>In his newly published autobiography,</i>

31:48.064 --> 31:50.659
<i>former real estate mogul, Jordan Collier, claims</i>

31:50.695 --> 31:52.726
<i>that the 4400 were abducted</i>

31:52.761 --> 31:55.227
<i>by human beings, from the future.</i>

31:55.304 --> 31:59.108
<i>The book contains copies of classified government memoranda, that Collier says</i>

31:59.143 --> 32:00.658
<i>prove his claims.</i>

32:00.705 --> 32:05.283
<i>The documents are said to come from an anonymous
source within the national threat assessment command.</i>

32:05.330 --> 32:06.590
<i>According to Collier,</i>

32:06.636 --> 32:11.486
<i>the 4400 were returned to avert a catastrophe that threatens the survival of mankind.</i>

32:11.487 --> 32:12.287
Why didn't you tell me ?

32:12.290 --> 32:12.930
<i>Collier charges</i>

32:12.975 --> 32:18.764
<i>that the government has had this information for more than a
year, but has kept it secret in an effort to avert a public panic.</i>

32:18.998 --> 32:24.199
<i>The government claims that the documents are purely
speculative and have been quoted out of context.</i>

32:24.258 --> 32:25.784
Don't care who took them.

32:26.313 --> 32:28.713
Don't care who sent them back. The government should have kept them behind bars.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.939
Didn't you hear what the man said ? They're here to save the world.

32:30.962 --> 32:32.872
What do you expect him to say ? He's one of them.

32:33.633 --> 32:35.042
You're awful quiet.

32:37.966 --> 32:39.492
I deal in facts...

32:40.032 --> 32:41.265
And the fact is,

32:41.300 --> 32:44.165
I've got to flush this radiator before lunch.

32:55.057 --> 32:58.650
You'll be happy to hear that M. Collier's anonymous source is anonymous no more.

32:58.861 --> 33:01.644
Agent Hubbard will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.057
So, what about Collier ?

33:03.104 --> 33:04.889
Guy bought national secrets on the black market.

33:04.924 --> 33:08.400
I'm sure we'd all like to see Collier charged with treason, but it's unlikely.

33:08.729 --> 33:11.323
I doubt we'll be able to trace the payments directly to him.

33:12.452 --> 33:13.344
Now,

33:13.508 --> 33:16.362
as for this so-called "4400 Center",

33:16.596 --> 33:18.992
Round-the-clock surveillance is in effect until further notice.

33:19.027 --> 33:21.810
I want pictures of everyone who comes within a hundred yards of that place.

33:21.845 --> 33:25.142
Is it true that Collier's filing for tax-exempt status ?

33:25.178 --> 33:25.941
Apparently.

33:25.976 --> 33:28.301
He's turning the 4400 into some kind of religion ?

33:28.336 --> 33:29.616
More like a cult.

33:30.602 --> 33:33.669
Well, "cult" is what the big congregation calls the little congregation.

33:34.185 --> 33:37.038
Cult, religion, whatever. What's he basing it on ?

33:37.074 --> 33:38.753
Have you read this thing ?

33:38.788 --> 33:42.628
Collier claims that he can unlock the 4400 within anybody.

33:42.669 --> 33:45.863
So he expects a guy punching a clock in Pittsburgh

33:45.898 --> 33:48.207
to believe he has some kind of latent superpower ?

33:48.242 --> 33:51.201
Most of the 4400 don't even have those kinds of abilities.

33:51.236 --> 33:52.211
Not yet, anyway.

33:52.246 --> 33:54.266
No, but if you thought there was a chance

33:54.313 --> 33:57.374
that you had an ability locked away inside you...

33:57.992 --> 34:00.059
You sound like you're ready to sign up.

34:00.834 --> 34:01.620
No,

34:02.172 --> 34:04.274
but I wouldn't blame anyone for being curious.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.752
We keep telling the public that biologically,

34:06.787 --> 34:09.231
the 4400 aren't any different than the rest of us.

34:09.266 --> 34:12.308
They haven't been altered genetically, neurologically...

34:12.342 --> 34:14.503
As far as we can tell.

34:14.562 --> 34:17.603
But if Collier thinks people are just going to sign their lives

34:17.650 --> 34:19.880
and their life savings over to some...

34:19.975 --> 34:22.299
metaphysical pyramid scheme, then...

34:22.346 --> 34:24.190
He's in for a rude awakening.

34:58.723 --> 35:01.165
Welcome to the Center. My name's Devon.

35:01.670 --> 35:03.513
- What's yours ?
- Kyle.

35:03.559 --> 35:06.259
Nice to meet you, Kyle. Can I sign you up for a tour ?

35:06.294 --> 35:09.195
Huh, thanks. I'm just looking for my cousin, Shawn Farrell ?

35:09.242 --> 35:11.754
I'm sorry, M. Farrell's not available right now.

35:11.790 --> 35:14.393
Could you tell him Kyle's looking for him ?
He does live here, right ?

35:14.768 --> 35:18.397
I'm afraid policy prohibits me from
discussing our membership.

35:18.843 --> 35:21.109
I'm not looking for a discussion.
I just want to say hi to my cousin.

35:21.144 --> 35:22.412
If you'd like to leave your name and number...

35:22.450 --> 35:24.516
I'm not leaving anything !
What's the problem here ?

35:24.798 --> 35:26.066
There's no problem.

35:26.090 --> 35:29.272
Then tell Shawn I'm here ! If he doesn't want
to see me, fine, but that's up to him, right ?

35:29.295 --> 35:31.268
Would you lower your voice, please ?

35:32.643 --> 35:35.273
Look, I've got nothing against you. Personally,

35:35.308 --> 35:38.185
I hope the pod people return your body to you someday.

35:38.596 --> 35:40.956
If it's all the same, I'll find Shawn myself.

35:47.009 --> 35:48.113
This way, sir.

35:48.154 --> 35:50.109
- Get your hands off me !
- You have to leave.

35:53.708 --> 35:55.678
You guys didn't tell me this thing was so big.

35:55.725 --> 35:57.604
- It wasn't.
- Not yesterday.

35:58.379 --> 36:00.516
And those don't look like patients to me.

36:00.551 --> 36:01.526
They're not.

36:01.573 --> 36:02.641
Dr. Clayton !

36:02.674 --> 36:04.847
I know what you're going to say.
We're falling behind.

36:04.882 --> 36:06.490
We'll make up the time this afternoon.

36:06.526 --> 36:09.578
So is the entire hospital working on this thing ?

36:10.808 --> 36:12.498
It's the only way to get it done.

36:13.426 --> 36:14.318
Excuse me.

36:14.471 --> 36:17.324
Uh, Randy, Winston, we need a little help here.

36:17.359 --> 36:19.590
Dr. Cho's back there with the satellite dish.

36:20.718 --> 36:21.350
Okay.

36:22.102 --> 36:24.638
So first the patients, now the staff.

36:24.661 --> 36:27.749
If this is some kind of mass hysteria, it's spreading.

36:33.472 --> 36:35.315
Who does daddy love ?

36:37.194 --> 36:38.239
Mommy...

36:39.143 --> 36:40.834
And Isabelle.

36:41.738 --> 36:43.616
Yes, he does.

36:46.185 --> 36:48.252
You know what he sees when he looks at you ?

36:49.090 --> 36:49.795
Huh ?

36:51.169 --> 36:53.799
A beautiful baby. Yes, he does.

36:54.926 --> 36:57.016
But mommy sees much more than that,

36:58.579 --> 36:59.847
And you know why ?

37:01.362 --> 37:03.452
Because you communicate with mommy.

37:04.016 --> 37:05.988
But you never talk to daddy.

37:07.397 --> 37:08.689
So how about it ?

37:11.097 --> 37:13.093
Anything you want to say to daddy ?

37:13.856 --> 37:14.795
Huh ?

37:15.981 --> 37:17.790
Cause I'm listening.

37:19.163 --> 37:20.631
Okay, then.

37:21.928 --> 37:24.441
Guess I'm left to muddle along all alone.

37:28.605 --> 37:31.588
Richard. We got to get a copy
of that book. I want to read it.

37:31.611 --> 37:33.948
You and me both, but I checked in town.

37:33.983 --> 37:35.827
They won't have any copies till tomorrow.

37:38.164 --> 37:42.356
I don't know about you, but I kind of got used
to the idea we'd never know where she came from.

37:44.349 --> 37:47.566
Well, if we went to the future,
at least we came back with a souvenir.

37:54.458 --> 37:56.173
The people who took us,

37:56.208 --> 37:57.864
they made all this happen, right ?

37:59.026 --> 38:01.480
They saw to it that we got Isabelle.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.545
They must have something in mind for her.

38:04.744 --> 38:06.428
I have something in mind for her too,

38:07.332 --> 38:08.471
a normal life.

38:09.172 --> 38:10.572
Sounds good but,

38:10.784 --> 38:13.367
we left normal behind a long time ago.

38:22.761 --> 38:25.943
This is outrageous ! We have work
to finish here. Important work.

38:25.978 --> 38:29.555
The doctors want to work. Tell them to make their rounds.
No one's stopping them from taking care of their patients.

38:29.590 --> 38:30.705
Now on,

38:30.729 --> 38:33.335
- the tower and the courtyard are off-limits, you got it ?
- Got it.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.553
Man, look at the size of that thing.

38:36.964 --> 38:39.592
Wouldn't mind having one of those in my backyard, huh ?

38:40.425 --> 38:42.304
Road trip's over. Wait in the car.

38:48.063 --> 38:51.374
So yesterday, a few patients were compelled to work on this thing,

38:51.409 --> 38:53.758
and today it's the entire hospital.

38:53.793 --> 38:55.272
If we get Tess out of here,

38:55.542 --> 38:57.338
do you think this compulsion will fade ?

38:59.284 --> 39:00.247
I don't know.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.691
It's worth a try, isn't it ?

39:06.270 --> 39:07.468
All right, I got you.

39:09.800 --> 39:10.786
It's okay.

39:11.056 --> 39:12.806
I'm not a bad person.

39:13.205 --> 39:14.121
I'm not.

39:14.145 --> 39:15.718
No, no, no one's saying you are, Tess.

39:15.741 --> 39:18.137
Then why are you going to stick wires in my brain ?

39:18.184 --> 39:19.763
I promise, Tess. No one's going to hurt you.

39:19.810 --> 39:22.088
That's what everyone says, right before they hurt you.

39:22.111 --> 39:25.869
Why am I being punished ? I'm a good person.
Really. I'm only doing what they want.

39:29.832 --> 39:31.792
Guys ! Guys ! Get over here !

39:35.920 --> 39:36.783
Kevin !

39:49.145 --> 39:50.953
Okay, Tess. Let's go. Come on.

39:51.188 --> 39:52.150
- It's all right.
- Kevin...

40:00.858 --> 40:03.323
- Do you have a seven ?
- Go fish.

40:04.357 --> 40:06.740
I am so sorry I'm late.

40:08.489 --> 40:09.945
Who do we have here ?

40:09.980 --> 40:12.082
This is Carrie. She lives downstairs.

40:12.105 --> 40:14.782
The U. P. S. man left their package
with us by mistake,

40:14.829 --> 40:17.389
and when her mom came to get it,
Carrie was with her,

40:17.483 --> 40:19.741
and now I'm invited to her birthday party,

40:19.777 --> 40:21.467
and it's a sleep-over.

40:21.608 --> 40:23.158
I can go, right ?

40:25.777 --> 40:26.904
Hi, Carrie.

40:27.068 --> 40:28.113
I'm Diana.

40:28.231 --> 40:29.544
It's nice to meet you.

40:29.567 --> 40:30.882
Nice to meet you.

40:31.587 --> 40:33.395
I already said it's okay.

40:33.477 --> 40:37.167
Well, I think we should probably talk
to Carrie's mom first, don't you ?

40:40.044 --> 40:42.286
Oh, look, you know what ? It sounds fine to me.

40:42.310 --> 40:44.938
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

40:45.008 --> 40:47.251
You never told me I was a prisoner.

40:47.274 --> 40:50.527
Have you ever seen a prison cell, Shawn ?
It looks nothing like your apartment.

40:50.550 --> 40:54.141
Goddammit, Jordan, since when
do you decide who i see and talk to ?

40:54.164 --> 40:55.902
This is about your cousin, isn't it ?

40:56.982 --> 40:58.462
So you did know he was here.

40:58.638 --> 41:01.775
I know he was rude and aggressive,
and had to be escorted from the premises.

41:01.798 --> 41:03.430
You mean thrown out.

41:03.606 --> 41:06.319
It might have been handled more smoothly, Shawn,

41:06.847 --> 41:09.667
but all in all, I'd have to say it was for the best.

41:09.713 --> 41:11.346
Kyle is my friend.

41:11.850 --> 41:13.659
He was your friend.

41:14.622 --> 41:18.027
Look, a year ago, you came to me looking for a new life,

41:18.062 --> 41:19.940
your old one in shambles.

41:20.119 --> 41:21.998
Kyle, friend or not,

41:22.021 --> 41:23.524
is part of that old life.

41:23.571 --> 41:24.581
So what do you want me to do ?

41:24.616 --> 41:26.965
You just want me to cut him loose
and forget he exists ?

41:26.988 --> 41:30.604
He's no different than your mother,
your brother, or your friend Nikki.

41:30.607 --> 41:31.199
Don't you...

41:31.202 --> 41:34.467
They do not understand what it is
we're trying to accomplish here.

41:39.446 --> 41:41.401
You know, maybe I don't either.

41:44.926 --> 41:49.059
Well, then, I suggest you pack your bags and...
Leave.

42:07.156 --> 42:10.525
So, what happens next time
you start screaming out in pain ?

42:10.766 --> 42:12.386
Do what's right for you, Shawn.

42:14.130 --> 42:15.586
I'll take care of myself.

42:22.162 --> 42:24.875
I just got the full medical workup on Tess.

42:25.004 --> 42:27.317
Let me guess...
Physically normal across the board.

42:27.353 --> 42:30.429
You can say this for the 4400...
They're consistent.

42:30.453 --> 42:33.505
Tess draws a picture of a...
a tower, or a monument...

42:33.529 --> 42:34.372
Yeah, or a beacon...

42:34.396 --> 42:36.685
And the people around her drop everything
and start building it.

42:36.709 --> 42:39.433
Well, they can't help themselves.
They have to work.

42:40.889 --> 42:42.133
It's like ants.

42:42.754 --> 42:43.505
Come here.

42:45.806 --> 42:48.648
The queen secretes a chemical,
tells the other ants what to do.

42:49.517 --> 42:52.133
The drones don't stop working until
the job is done.

42:52.157 --> 42:54.658
Doesn't matter if one of them dies,
or if

42:54.693 --> 42:57.053
a storm comes and washes away the anthill.

42:57.088 --> 42:58.626
They just keep working...

42:58.744 --> 43:00.385
Unless you take the queen away.

43:01.078 --> 43:03.157
Let's hope our drones respond the same way.

43:03.192 --> 43:05.843
Right, so the future sent back
a schizophrenic queen ant

43:05.878 --> 43:09.424
with a blueprint for what,
some interstellar walkie-talkie ?

43:10.387 --> 43:12.113
Let's see what Tess can tell us.

43:13.152 --> 43:14.702
We'd just better not get too close,

43:14.737 --> 43:18.342
because if your theory's right, anyone
who gets exposed to her could be vulnerable.

43:19.857 --> 43:23.412
All right, I'll talk to Tess.
You check in with Garrity at the hospital.

43:26.383 --> 43:27.886
These friends of yours,

43:28.297 --> 43:29.612
the ones who took you,

43:31.011 --> 43:32.890
what do you think they want to talk about ?

43:35.273 --> 43:38.620
They're so much smarter than you,
it isn't even funny.

43:38.794 --> 43:39.627
Yeah, well...

43:40.027 --> 43:41.283
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

43:41.541 --> 43:44.312
I mean, they figured out how to take you
and how to send you back.

43:45.651 --> 43:48.878
Sending me back was a mistake, and they know it.

43:50.287 --> 43:52.118
I'm supposed to be there.

43:54.326 --> 43:56.132
Where exactly is "there ?"

43:58.198 --> 44:00.230
There were doctors there too.

44:00.535 --> 44:02.811
They were nice. All of them.

44:04.513 --> 44:05.640
They were nice.

44:08.200 --> 44:09.985
You remember where you were taken ?

44:11.431 --> 44:14.190
We slept a lot, but not all the time.

44:15.247 --> 44:17.219
We wore gray clothes.

44:19.674 --> 44:21.754
There was a giant building.

44:22.693 --> 44:25.159
The doctors wore shiny jackets.

44:27.718 --> 44:29.538
I miss it so much.

44:35.407 --> 44:36.335
Go on.

44:37.568 --> 44:39.752
I really like hearing you talk about it.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.814
Our rooms had round windows.

44:45.718 --> 44:48.525
High doorways with arches in them.

44:50.333 --> 44:54.593
The stones had writing in them.
Math symbols or something,

44:55.591 --> 44:57.200
inscriptions,

44:59.454 --> 45:01.997
jars of purplish metals,

45:02.044 --> 45:04.944
and rods with stained tips.

45:09.758 --> 45:12.304
These symbols, Tess, what did they look like ?

45:14.628 --> 45:15.591
Tess ?

45:15.929 --> 45:18.010
Tess, do you remember
what the inscriptions said ?

45:18.031 --> 45:19.945
They're waiting to hear from me.

45:19.980 --> 45:21.589
I need to get in touch with them.

45:21.624 --> 45:23.127
Tess. Tess. Just wait...

45:23.289 --> 45:24.521
Tess, just wait.

45:46.559 --> 45:48.931
Garrity, why haven't you been
picking up your cellphone ?

45:48.955 --> 45:50.868
I'm sorry.
It's been kind of crazy down here.

45:50.892 --> 45:52.183
So is everything all right ?

45:52.219 --> 45:54.332
Yeah. Fine.
We're just about done here.

45:54.459 --> 45:55.211
Done ?

45:55.246 --> 45:58.193
Well, the satellite dishes are a bitch to hook up,
but we'll get 'em.

45:59.872 --> 46:03.573
Come on, people. Let's get those
dishes secured. We don't have all day.

46:05.651 --> 46:08.821
I just had the most unbelievable
conversation with Tess.

46:08.845 --> 46:12.813
Well, it couldn't have been any more unbelievable
than the one I just had with Garrity.

46:22.630 --> 46:24.291
Can't say I see it that way.

46:24.327 --> 46:27.004
No other way to see it.
That book is blasphemy.

46:27.027 --> 46:28.788
Well, don't buy it if that's how you feel.

46:28.821 --> 46:33.940
"The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great
star fell from heaven, burning like a torch."

46:33.976 --> 46:36.077
Revelations 8:10.

46:36.251 --> 46:37.648
I'll take your word for it.

46:37.671 --> 46:40.654
The day they came back
was the beginning of the end times.

46:40.677 --> 46:43.037
Sounds like you've done a little more thinking
on it than I have.

46:43.073 --> 46:44.973
Either remove the book from the store,

46:44.996 --> 46:47.450
or my boy here will remove it for you.

46:47.486 --> 46:48.789
Like hell he will !

46:55.847 --> 46:59.498
Do you know what you're carrying there, woman ?

46:59.710 --> 47:01.283
It's just a book.

47:02.187 --> 47:04.401
It's the doorway to hell.

47:11.804 --> 47:13.196
That child yours ?

47:13.231 --> 47:14.497
That's my daughter.

47:16.651 --> 47:19.927
Abomination begets abomination.

48:01.368 --> 48:02.437
Richard !

48:03.200 --> 48:04.468
What's going on ?

48:04.492 --> 48:06.558
We've got to get out of here.
Now.

48:21.333 --> 48:22.084
Ok...

48:22.460 --> 48:24.163
Sheriff, what's the hell happen ?

48:24.186 --> 48:26.147
These new guys you sent us are no good.

48:26.171 --> 48:28.542
Park told me he had experience with a welding torch.

48:28.566 --> 48:32.344
Experience at what ? Starting fires ?
Now our schedule's in the toilet.

48:32.403 --> 48:34.470
Did either of you call the fire department ?

49:06.763 --> 49:07.937
Time to go.

49:23.329 --> 49:24.668
Hurry, Richard.

49:26.640 --> 49:27.521
Hurry !

50:14.581 --> 50:18.090
As of tonight, Abendson State Hospital
is officially under quarantine.

50:18.114 --> 50:20.004
The patients will remain locked down.

50:20.039 --> 50:23.902
Hospital staff and affected NTAC personnel
will be confined to the site until we've

50:23.926 --> 50:25.981
isolated the source of the compulsion.

50:26.075 --> 50:28.495
That sounds like a good plan,
but who's going to watch over them ?

50:28.519 --> 50:30.635
The last group we sent was compromised
within hours.

50:30.682 --> 50:33.183
Which is, quite frankly,
a little disturbing.

50:33.215 --> 50:35.458
If you think of this like an epidemic...

50:35.676 --> 50:38.681
In the CDC, we'd call Tess
"the sole disease vector."

50:38.717 --> 50:41.006
You remove her, you remove the urge to build,

50:41.042 --> 50:42.380
except as far as we know...

50:42.415 --> 50:44.564
None of those agents had any contact with Tess.

50:44.587 --> 50:47.327
So it's like the flu,
or any other airborne virus.

50:47.385 --> 50:49.246
You catch it, you can pass it on.

50:49.270 --> 50:51.313
What is this thing supposed to be, anyway ?

50:51.829 --> 50:55.521
My guess, and I cannot emphasize
the word "guess" strongly enough,

50:55.767 --> 50:59.325
Is that Tess is telling us the truth.
It's some kind of communication device.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.638
To contact who ?
The future ?

51:02.563 --> 51:05.534
The only way to find out
is to let the patients finish building it.

51:06.450 --> 51:09.749
That night on Highland Beach, they were trying to
tell us something. The conversation was cut short.

51:09.785 --> 51:12.696
Which is why we've been stumbling
around in the dark this last year.

51:12.731 --> 51:16.042
Tess is the only 4400
who remembers where she was taken...

51:16.065 --> 51:18.425
No, claims to remember where she was taken.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.868
She's also the only paranoid schizophrenic.

51:21.866 --> 51:25.324
And it sounds to me like you two have been
spending a little too much time around her.

51:26.041 --> 51:28.835
Well, maybe I caught the bug too,
but, uh...

51:28.929 --> 51:30.315
I agree with them.

51:32.299 --> 51:35.532
The quarantine orders at the hospital
remain in effect until further notice.

51:35.567 --> 51:38.456
The guards will rotate shifts to minimize their exposure.

51:38.784 --> 51:40.510
So where does that leave us ?

51:41.265 --> 51:43.437
Until we're sure the compulsion's
not spreading anymore,

51:43.472 --> 51:45.973
you two aren't going anywhere near that facility.

51:51.214 --> 51:52.587
Isabelle's asleep.

51:56.004 --> 51:58.341
Rainy day came sooner than expected.

51:58.552 --> 51:59.806
Do you think we lost them ?

51:59.841 --> 52:02.565
I'm not ready to stop for pie just yet.

52:02.694 --> 52:04.420
I got 1,200 here.

52:04.456 --> 52:06.064
Another 300 in my pocket.

52:06.100 --> 52:07.542
I'm carrying two.

52:08.916 --> 52:11.417
We're going to have to get those back windows
replaced in the morning.

52:11.511 --> 52:13.859
This should be enough to carry us
through to Montana.

52:13.891 --> 52:15.570
What did Eric say when you called him?

52:15.653 --> 52:17.531
He was a little surprised to hear from me,

52:18.095 --> 52:22.075
but even back in quarantine, he used to say
how us 4400s should stick together.

52:22.111 --> 52:24.612
Yeah, we didn't have much choice back then,
though, did we ?

52:28.569 --> 52:30.683
The bank will wire us our savings
when we get there.

52:30.718 --> 52:33.642
If things get really bad, we can sell these.

52:35.284 --> 52:37.022
I put that ring on you forever.

52:42.681 --> 52:45.781
Guess you and Isabelle were right.
We should have taken off when we had the chance.

52:48.947 --> 52:50.379
It's gonna be a long night.

52:50.954 --> 52:52.422
You want me to drive a shift ?

52:53.279 --> 52:54.536
Get some sleep.

53:23.266 --> 53:24.839
Maia, what's wrong ?

53:24.875 --> 53:26.448
I'm sorry.
I know it's late, but...

53:26.483 --> 53:28.524
Maia really wanted to come home.

53:28.559 --> 53:29.886
Why is that, sweetie ?

53:29.921 --> 53:31.635
I don't want to talk about it.

53:32.199 --> 53:34.171
Some of the girls,
not my daughter, but

53:34.207 --> 53:36.389
some of the other girls,
were teasing Maia.

53:36.424 --> 53:39.394
I guess she said she has a crush on Frank Sinatra.

53:40.357 --> 53:42.447
Well, ol' blue eyes. Do you blame her ?

53:42.483 --> 53:46.038
Most nine-year-olds don't even know
who Frank Sinatra was.

53:46.719 --> 53:48.258
I want to go to bed.

53:51.416 --> 53:53.433
I guess it got pretty nasty.

53:54.149 --> 53:56.028
I feel terrible.

53:56.063 --> 53:59.328
Maybe Maia can come back another time ?
Just her and Carrie.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.298
Yeah. We'll talk about it.

54:01.944 --> 54:02.812
Thank you.

54:03.388 --> 54:04.867
- Good night.
- Good night.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.126
Maia.

54:21.911 --> 54:25.105
I know you didn't fall asleep that fast.

54:28.615 --> 54:29.825
It was awful.

54:30.295 --> 54:31.469
You were right.

54:31.962 --> 54:33.923
Well, I didn't want to be right.

54:35.144 --> 54:37.176
I don't need any friends.

54:37.411 --> 54:39.383
Everyone needs friends, Maia.

54:41.141 --> 54:43.524
Come on, I really think we should talk about this.

54:43.548 --> 54:45.121
Well, I don't.

55:11.858 --> 55:14.296
Buck's burgers.
Good as I remembered.

55:14.402 --> 55:16.774
Kind of a strange thing to have on top of your list,

55:16.797 --> 55:18.089
but hey, you know what ?

55:18.664 --> 55:21.107
I'm glad I could make your dreams come true.

55:23.178 --> 55:24.904
Kyle, shouldn't you be in bed ?

55:25.667 --> 55:27.276
Dad, I'm 21.

55:28.204 --> 55:30.752
So I have to keep reminding myself.

55:33.875 --> 55:35.711
I'm making some popcorn. You want some ?

55:35.746 --> 55:36.932
You're kidding me.

55:37.343 --> 55:38.411
You could eat more ?

55:38.564 --> 55:40.748
I've been eating quarantine food for a year.

55:40.771 --> 55:44.364
You guys might be keeping the country safe,
but your cafeteria sucks.

55:47.495 --> 55:48.387
Hello ?

55:50.231 --> 55:51.053
Hello ?

55:53.483 --> 55:54.305
Kyle.

56:00.286 --> 56:02.435
We got to get the baby out of the cold.

56:02.957 --> 56:06.162
I don't think there's any motels on this road.

56:07.309 --> 56:08.836
I was thinking we'd head south,

56:09.094 --> 56:10.550
catch the 35.

56:19.817 --> 56:21.672
Guy should lose his high beams.

56:23.856 --> 56:26.052
That's the first car we've seen in, what, like,

56:26.322 --> 56:27.661
15 miles ?

56:36.344 --> 56:38.023
Get your head down.

56:46.951 --> 56:48.877
Oh, my god, Richard.
It's them.

57:03.565 --> 57:05.300
Hold on ! Hold on !

57:17.852 --> 57:19.202
Everybody okay ?

57:19.437 --> 57:20.517
Yeah, i think so.

57:20.670 --> 57:22.218
Okay. Let's go.

57:40.625 --> 57:41.858
Spread out.

57:51.590 --> 57:52.823
Hey, Maia, sweetie.

57:54.021 --> 57:55.463
It's wake-up time.

57:55.733 --> 57:57.694
- Okay.
- Huh ?

57:58.621 --> 58:00.253
It was a late night, huh ?

58:02.813 --> 58:05.030
All right. 15 more minutes.

58:09.572 --> 58:11.750
You know what ?
Frank Sinatra is the coolest,

58:11.784 --> 58:14.600
and don't you let anyone ever tell you're different.

58:32.666 --> 58:34.251
So you didn't read any of it ?

58:34.274 --> 58:37.104
No. I wouldn't want
my daughter reading my diary.

58:37.656 --> 58:38.771
You keep a diary ?

58:39.018 --> 58:39.828
Am I in it ?

58:39.861 --> 58:41.669
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

58:42.162 --> 58:45.133
So, really, you don't even know
if "what she sees" means...

58:45.262 --> 58:48.902
things during the day,
tv shows, ponies, whatnot...

58:49.142 --> 58:51.326
Or it could be "what she sees,"

58:51.385 --> 58:53.076
A week, a month, a year down the line.

58:53.111 --> 58:56.211
She hasn't had one of those visions
in, like, four months.

58:56.821 --> 58:58.876
Well, that's what she tells you, anyway.

58:58.923 --> 59:00.259
Why would she lie ?

59:00.975 --> 59:03.371
She wants to be normal, right ?

59:03.512 --> 59:06.259
Every time she makes a prediction,
someone calls her a freak.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.594
Look, I understand.

59:08.629 --> 59:11.306
You're her mom now.
There are certain protocols.

59:11.386 --> 59:13.218
Next time I'm over, why don't I take a peek ?

59:13.241 --> 59:15.496
You think that'd be any less of a betrayal ?

59:17.586 --> 59:20.251
Respecting Maia's privacy is no small thing,
but

59:20.286 --> 59:24.023
you've got to weigh that against the information
that could be in that diary.

59:24.070 --> 59:24.880
You know what ?

59:24.915 --> 59:27.769
When you stop trusting a parent,
it's really hard to start again,

59:27.804 --> 59:30.082
And yes, I'm speaking from experience.

59:31.291 --> 59:32.111
Hey.

59:32.251 --> 59:34.412
I'm glad it's not my decision,

59:34.484 --> 59:37.579
but if Maia's having visions,
you should know about it,

59:37.617 --> 59:39.555
and you should know what they are.

59:44.248 --> 59:45.257
Is it bad ?

59:47.570 --> 59:49.647
I just jammed it when we spun out.

59:50.034 --> 59:51.878
Just need to walk it off a little more.

59:55.025 --> 59:56.678
We'll follow this stream south.

59:57.195 --> 59:58.651
Hike through the water a bit,

59:58.874 --> 01:00:00.306
throw 'em off our trail.

01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:02.006
It'll be cold.

01:00:02.194 --> 01:00:03.615
It'll keep us awake.

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:05.224
After a mile, we'll...

01:00:06.797 --> 01:00:08.300
we'll double back west.

01:00:09.755 --> 01:00:11.798
Head straight for the highway.

01:00:12.861 --> 01:00:14.658
Sounds easy when you say it.

01:00:15.609 --> 01:00:16.759
We can do it.

01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:18.861
We're going to do it, right ?

01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:25.896
Keep her quiet.
She's going to bring them right to us.

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:51.961
Does the name "Gene Pecusa" ring a bell ?

01:00:52.384 --> 01:00:54.181
Yeah, returnee 927.

01:00:54.419 --> 01:00:55.276
Oh, let me guess.

01:00:55.299 --> 01:00:58.622
He still has the ability
to turn 20 bucks into a crushing hangover.

01:00:58.646 --> 01:01:02.309
And a night in the drunk tank.
Come on, we've got to ferry him back to his halfway house.

01:01:02.344 --> 01:01:04.094
Give it to Mortimer and Falcone.

01:01:04.566 --> 01:01:06.386
We got something else on our plates ?

01:01:06.421 --> 01:01:07.279
No.

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.623
Everything's quiet at Abendson.
No one's been allowed near the tower.

01:01:14.262 --> 01:01:15.730
That's the problem, isn't it ?

01:01:15.765 --> 01:01:17.550
Tom... Tom, no.

01:01:17.585 --> 01:01:20.544
You do remember that Jarvis has still
got your letter of resignation.

01:01:20.567 --> 01:01:22.634
She wants results.
I'm going to give them to her.

01:01:22.716 --> 01:01:25.215
And besides, you want to know
what that thing is as badly as i do.

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:26.800
I'm trying not to think about it.

01:01:26.835 --> 01:01:28.819
Yeah, well, I can't think of anything else.

01:01:29.806 --> 01:01:32.318
So it sounds like Tess has got her hooks in you.

01:01:32.903 --> 01:01:35.170
I don't have the urge to pick up a tool belt.

01:01:40.206 --> 01:01:41.604
I'm coming with you.

01:01:42.931 --> 01:01:45.502
It's all right, Tess.
We're taking you back to Abendson.

01:01:46.547 --> 01:01:49.130
We signed you out, Tess.
No one from NTAC is coming after you.

01:01:49.165 --> 01:01:51.652
Not you people. The doctors in the submarines.

01:01:51.675 --> 01:01:53.061
They're watching us.

01:01:54.212 --> 01:01:55.926
Come on, what, you're having second thoughts ?

01:01:56.349 --> 01:01:57.488
No, just get in.

01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:14.622
So you still owe me

01:02:15.244 --> 01:02:18.778
four or five dollars for those two
six-packs ? Something like that ?

01:02:18.811 --> 01:02:21.676
I've got a 20 right here,
if you think you can take it from me.

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.487
Look at you, man.
Back among the living. You look great.

01:02:27.522 --> 01:02:30.927
I walk. I talk.
I seem to have full control of my limbs.

01:02:31.902 --> 01:02:33.628
You still hit like a girl.

01:02:33.921 --> 01:02:35.307
Nothing's changed.

01:02:35.354 --> 01:02:37.430
Four years ? Plenty's changed.

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:40.095
What are you talking about ?
We saw each other right when you got out of the hospital.

01:02:40.136 --> 01:02:41.545
I don't remember any of that.

01:02:41.745 --> 01:02:42.600
You don't ?

01:02:43.046 --> 01:02:45.946
So you don't remember sitting naked in the sprinklers ?

01:02:45.981 --> 01:02:48.518
No.
Sounds like something you'd do.

01:02:48.659 --> 01:02:49.598
Well...

01:02:49.844 --> 01:02:50.910
Thank you.

01:02:51.485 --> 01:02:54.621
I never got a chance to say that.
For getting me out of the coma...thank you.

01:02:56.394 --> 01:02:59.094
You know, if it hadn't been for me,
you wouldn't have been

01:02:59.684 --> 01:03:02.291
in that stupid hospital anyway, so...

01:03:02.326 --> 01:03:05.649
No, I'd have been the one who disappeared into 4400 boot camp.

01:03:05.814 --> 01:03:07.633
Maybe I'd have come back with the magic hands.

01:03:07.657 --> 01:03:09.430
All right, all right. Okay.

01:03:09.627 --> 01:03:11.379
Speaking of disappearing, you jerk...

01:03:11.403 --> 01:03:12.915
Oh, Kyle, don't go there yet.

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:16.036
Don't go there ?
Your mom is so freaked out.

01:03:16.282 --> 01:03:18.701
You haven't seen her in a year.
You haven't seen anybody.

01:03:19.147 --> 01:03:21.296
Your brother.
My dad.

01:03:22.479 --> 01:03:23.876
What was going on with you and Nikki ?

01:03:23.912 --> 01:03:25.426
Kyle, I don't want to talk about Nikki.

01:03:26.542 --> 01:03:28.585
We're all really worried about you, man.

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:33.921
You don't need to be.
I mean,

01:03:33.968 --> 01:03:35.048
I'm fine.

01:03:37.185 --> 01:03:39.205
I've been to that place where you're living.

01:03:39.498 --> 01:03:43.831
There are some serious Stepford Wives vibes going on there, you know that, right ?

01:03:45.381 --> 01:03:48.704
All that stuff about "unlocking the 4400 inside everybody..."

01:03:48.728 --> 01:03:49.444
Yeah ?

01:03:53.002 --> 01:03:55.332
You don't really believe Collier can do that, do you ?

01:03:57.821 --> 01:03:58.666
Kyle...

01:04:01.613 --> 01:04:03.034
Look around us, man.

01:04:03.058 --> 01:04:05.228
The world is in a total freefall.

01:04:05.991 --> 01:04:07.388
These centers,

01:04:07.529 --> 01:04:10.970
they're a chance to bring people together,
maybe our last chance.

01:04:12.062 --> 01:04:14.328
I don't just believe that he can do it.

01:04:15.243 --> 01:04:17.521
I believe that he has to do it.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.725
Sounds like someone got inside your head.

01:04:25.764 --> 01:04:27.396
He said you wouldn't understand.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:28.300
Collier ?

01:04:29.486 --> 01:04:30.202
Yeah.

01:04:31.165 --> 01:04:33.055
I got to tell you, man, he was right.

01:04:51.162 --> 01:04:52.043
Isabelle...

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:00.309
Richard !

01:05:01.894 --> 01:05:03.115
God. What happened ?

01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:05.532
Guess I wasn't looking where I was going.

01:05:05.555 --> 01:05:07.810
Okay. We just need to rest.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:11.402
You think they're stopping for breaks ?

01:05:14.159 --> 01:05:15.427
Come on, Richard.

01:05:15.674 --> 01:05:16.531
Alright.

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:17.728
Five minutes.

01:05:25.572 --> 01:05:26.957
All right, people, come on !

01:05:27.122 --> 01:05:29.083
Everyone out to the tower.

01:05:29.203 --> 01:05:30.048
Come on.

01:05:30.213 --> 01:05:33.336
We've got a lot of work to do, and not a lot of time to do it,
so let's go, come on.

01:05:33.911 --> 01:05:34.980
Go, go.

01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:36.958
Come on, you heard me. Let's go.

01:05:36.993 --> 01:05:38.907
This one's mine. Stand over there.

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:40.738
Hey, Kevin !

01:05:41.924 --> 01:05:43.708
Look. I escaped.

01:05:46.139 --> 01:05:47.724
Always thinking of me.

01:05:48.828 --> 01:05:50.930
Kevin's a genius, you know,

01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:52.527
but he doesn't brag about it.

01:06:08.868 --> 01:06:11.287
I bet in a couple of days all
these berries will be ripe.

01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:13.424
Don't eat them now.

01:06:14.316 --> 01:06:16.981
The last thing we need is to start cramping up.

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:51.815
Look.

01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:55.584
I thought you said they weren't ripe.

01:06:57.111 --> 01:06:58.191
They weren't.

01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.750
Well...

01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:03.676
Isabelle ?

01:07:05.015 --> 01:07:06.318
Had to be.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:12.177
Way to go, little girl.

01:07:27.891 --> 01:07:29.664
They're going to have to work fast.

01:07:31.906 --> 01:07:33.148
I'm going to help them.

01:07:33.536 --> 01:07:34.393
That's not funny, Diana.

01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:36.236
I really want to do this.

01:07:36.272 --> 01:07:37.774
No, you'd only be in the way.

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:40.496
You don't understand.
I really need to do this.

01:08:12.678 --> 01:08:13.876
Have these sent to my house.

01:08:14.146 --> 01:08:15.987
Shawn, I've been looking for you.

01:08:16.013 --> 01:08:17.281
Yeah, I took a walk.

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:19.060
We have a special visitor tonight.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.077
She has pancreatic cancer.
Her husband

01:08:22.276 --> 01:08:25.987
is willing to donate real estate
for a 4400 center in Los Angeles.

01:08:26.022 --> 01:08:28.381
Well, tonight doesn't really work for me, Jordan.

01:08:28.848 --> 01:08:32.242
Well, you have five...
no, six hours to get in the mood.

01:08:32.265 --> 01:08:34.002
Mood's got nothing to do with it.

01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:35.587
I'm just not working tonight.

01:08:58.224 --> 01:08:58.941
Richard,

01:08:59.372 --> 01:09:01.404
please.
Don't do this.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:03.071
We don't have another choice.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.255
There's three of them.

01:09:05.549 --> 01:09:06.653
They're going to kill you.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:09.045
Not if I get my hands on one of those shotguns.

01:09:09.091 --> 01:09:10.290
You can barely walk.

01:09:13.554 --> 01:09:15.269
It's our only chance.

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:18.787
I've got to do it now,
while I still have the strength.

01:09:21.733 --> 01:09:23.399
If I'm not back by sundown,

01:09:24.363 --> 01:09:26.770
take the baby and walk due west.

01:09:27.283 --> 01:09:28.435
It's that way.

01:09:28.682 --> 01:09:30.255
Just keep going in a straight line.

01:09:32.345 --> 01:09:33.331
Understand ?

01:09:46.397 --> 01:09:48.979
I'd give up another 50 years if it meant finding you again.

01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:17.676
You knew about this, didn't you ?

01:10:17.712 --> 01:10:19.097
Knew about what ?

01:10:19.121 --> 01:10:23.101
Baldwin and Skouris signed Tess Doerner out of here
and took her back to Abendson.

01:10:24.778 --> 01:10:26.480
They're rebuilding the tower.

01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:28.899
That would be one theory.

01:11:04.865 --> 01:11:06.157
No crying.

01:11:06.627 --> 01:11:08.317
You can't cry now.

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:23.688
Drop it.

01:11:25.109 --> 01:11:26.809
I'll cut you in half.

01:11:30.461 --> 01:11:31.353
Yeah...

01:11:31.623 --> 01:11:33.056
Turn around.

01:11:46.312 --> 01:11:48.453
I taught you boys better than this.

01:11:49.357 --> 01:11:50.331
Get up !

01:12:07.098 --> 01:12:07.815
Diana,

01:12:08.109 --> 01:12:09.189
how's it going ?

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:11.150
Well, it turns out we're in better shape
than I thought.

01:12:11.185 --> 01:12:12.688
The fire missed most of the wiring.

01:12:12.723 --> 01:12:14.285
So how soon till it's ready to go ?

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.145
Well, we've got to finish triangulating the dishes,
and then we're good.

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:21.140
Just get it done.

01:12:21.527 --> 01:12:22.455
Baldwin.

01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:24.844
We've got your man !

01:12:25.514 --> 01:12:27.186
Either you come out,

01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:31.080
or the next sound you hear
is him being blown

01:12:31.094 --> 01:12:32.608
straight to hell !

01:12:32.642 --> 01:12:35.706
I told you, she's miles away by...

01:12:35.741 --> 01:12:38.994
Open your mouth again,
I'll cut your tongue out.

01:12:40.659 --> 01:12:41.422
Okay...

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.193
Watch him.

01:12:51.729 --> 01:12:53.502
Lily ! Run !

01:13:04.577 --> 01:13:06.620
Are you sure you don't want to say
goodbye to me ?

01:13:07.442 --> 01:13:09.166
I'm gonna miss you must of all.

01:13:22.248 --> 01:13:24.549
Last time, Baldwin, unlock the door.

01:13:24.784 --> 01:13:25.982
Can't do that

01:13:26.121 --> 01:13:27.459
You said you wanted results.

01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:30.160
Listen to me Baldwin, you are not in your right mind.

01:13:30.195 --> 01:13:32.743
These are not the results that I was talking about.

01:13:32.872 --> 01:13:35.150
Now step away before you get hurt.

01:13:40.766 --> 01:13:41.529
Take it.

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:45.228
No, no, just wait, wait !

01:13:45.273 --> 01:13:46.564
Just wait, just wait...

01:13:48.219 --> 01:13:51.751
We need answers that tower might provide.
Just listen, listen to me...

01:13:53.371 --> 01:13:54.780
It's a risk, I know.

01:13:55.872 --> 01:13:59.568
But sometimes when you want to get to the truth
you have to take a leap of faith, just...

01:13:59.604 --> 01:14:00.484
just listen to me.

01:14:01.377 --> 01:14:02.175
Hmmm.

01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:05.260
You want the truth ?

01:14:11.695 --> 01:14:13.767
Tess Doerner's memories of the future...

01:14:13.802 --> 01:14:15.094
They're not memories.

01:14:15.129 --> 01:14:17.759
She read the mini-short story by H. P. Lovecraft.

01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:20.255
"The Shadow Out of time", I have it right here.

01:14:20.454 --> 01:14:23.895
I underlined some of the passages that show up verbatim in your report.

01:14:25.456 --> 01:14:27.065
Just another delusion.

01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:29.570
No.

01:14:29.864 --> 01:14:30.967
I'm sorry Tom.

01:14:31.014 --> 01:14:33.304
Ok, let's go, okay, guys take it.

01:14:44.445 --> 01:14:46.764
Everyone step away from that tower.

01:15:48.846 --> 01:15:49.867
Isabelle...

01:15:57.306 --> 01:15:58.163
Isabelle...

01:16:07.392 --> 01:16:10.409
My son ! What did you make me do ?

01:16:10.445 --> 01:16:13.409
Gabriel, my god... my son !

01:16:14.532 --> 01:16:15.882
Richard !

01:16:21.072 --> 01:16:22.537
It wasn't me !

01:16:25.531 --> 01:16:28.373
That creature... made me pull the trigger.

01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:31.925
You've unleashed the Devil into this world !

01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:34.685
And we all are going to burn !

01:16:48.949 --> 01:16:49.795
Richard !

01:18:03.988 --> 01:18:05.326
Where are you ?

01:18:10.832 --> 01:18:12.077
Where are you ?

01:18:12.231 --> 01:18:13.703
Let's get everyone back in their rooms.

01:18:13.764 --> 01:18:16.351
We're gonna need a full head count before the next round of medications.

01:18:17.349 --> 01:18:18.709
Where are you ?

01:18:19.718 --> 01:18:22.126
I did what you wanted, right ?

01:18:23.417 --> 01:18:24.638
Talk to me.

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:26.491
Come on, tess.

01:18:27.606 --> 01:18:29.920
We all could use a little rest.

01:18:30.941 --> 01:18:32.514
But they lied to me.

01:18:34.816 --> 01:18:36.403
Or did i lie to you ?

01:18:45.301 --> 01:18:47.872
Well, somehow I wanted more.

01:18:48.777 --> 01:18:50.338
I don't know what I expected.

01:18:50.773 --> 01:18:52.205
Another ball of light,

01:18:52.264 --> 01:18:54.190
a booming voice from the sky...something.

01:18:55.769 --> 01:18:57.143
Could we have built it wrong ?

01:18:57.765 --> 01:18:58.634
Maybe.

01:18:59.327 --> 01:19:00.630
All I know is that

01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:04.810
I don't feel like picking up a hammer anymore,
and 10 minutes ago,

01:19:04.945 --> 01:19:06.740
that was all I could think of.

01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.329
- Yeah...
- Alright.

01:19:11.684 --> 01:19:14.878
NORAD said the pulse dissipated
before it left the atmosphere.

01:19:15.723 --> 01:19:18.494
Could be all this sound and fury
was for absolutely nothing.

01:19:20.829 --> 01:19:24.445
Now, our first priority is to help the hospital
personnel restore order here.

01:19:24.469 --> 01:19:28.541
Okay ? And then I want all of you who were infected
with this thing to be checked out by NTAC medical.

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:30.619
You including me in that order ?
Because i'm not sure...

01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:32.040
You were infected,

01:19:32.521 --> 01:19:34.257
because if you're standing here telling me you weren't,

01:19:34.297 --> 01:19:36.745
I'm putting a date on that letter of resignation.

01:19:39.119 --> 01:19:41.185
I was definitely infected.

01:19:42.019 --> 01:19:43.146
I thought so.

01:19:43.169 --> 01:19:45.565
We could use a little help policing the area here,

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.602
and we need to get rid of these tools
before one of the patients hurts themselves.

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:50.941
You heard the man.

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:53.277
Excuse me. Dr. Clayton ?

01:19:57.833 --> 01:19:58.678
Kevin...

01:19:59.864 --> 01:20:01.430
Did you just speak to me ?

01:20:03.144 --> 01:20:04.272
I guess I did.

01:20:05.974 --> 01:20:07.113
I haven't

01:20:07.712 --> 01:20:10.823
said anything for a long time, have I ?

01:20:12.752 --> 01:20:14.349
Try six years.

01:20:22.204 --> 01:20:24.756
I can think again too.

01:20:26.494 --> 01:20:27.797
I don't know what happened,

01:20:28.913 --> 01:20:29.723
but...

01:20:30.815 --> 01:20:32.224
I feel...

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:35.104
better.

01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:48.281
You had me followed ?

01:20:48.622 --> 01:20:50.688
I could have had your conversation recorded.

01:20:50.724 --> 01:20:52.755
I just thought that might be pushing it.

01:20:52.778 --> 01:20:55.630
God, Kyle's right.
I am some kind of prisoner.

01:20:55.865 --> 01:20:59.294
Shawn, I've told you,
you can leave here anytime you want,

01:20:59.329 --> 01:21:00.585
and I meant it,

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:02.499
but until you do,

01:21:02.766 --> 01:21:06.723
I will not allow these shadows from your past
to alter your perceptions

01:21:06.759 --> 01:21:09.659
of what it is we're trying to accomplish here.
You're too important.

01:21:09.694 --> 01:21:13.961
No, no, you mean you need me
to help bring in the big checks.

01:21:14.748 --> 01:21:16.204
Shawn, the money...

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:18.447
is a means to an end.

01:21:19.186 --> 01:21:21.147
The goal is what matters.

01:21:21.394 --> 01:21:23.308
Ensure the future.
Save...

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.359
the planet.

01:21:26.109 --> 01:21:28.363
I can't do that without you.

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:38.779
You want proof the future works in mysterious ways ?

01:21:38.814 --> 01:21:40.799
Look no further than M. Kevin Burkhoff.

01:21:40.834 --> 01:21:43.171
Yeah, instead of contacting the future,
we got him.

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.994
Well, not as disappointing as it might seem at first blush.

01:21:46.023 --> 01:21:49.609
Burkhoff was a tenured professor of neurochemistry at Stanford university.

01:21:49.648 --> 01:21:52.807
Neuroscience.
Only class I ever got a "b" in.

01:21:53.359 --> 01:21:55.073
Yeah, you're not alone.

01:21:55.248 --> 01:21:58.563
Only a handful of people work at the top of the field at any given time.

01:21:58.601 --> 01:22:00.957
Our M. Burkhoff was the heir apparent,

01:22:01.538 --> 01:22:04.266
until he suffered his first delusion at the age of 30,

01:22:04.324 --> 01:22:06.039
and he was institutionalized two years later.

01:22:06.069 --> 01:22:07.338
What was he working on ?

01:22:07.542 --> 01:22:08.904
You want a ripple effect ?

01:22:09.062 --> 01:22:10.109
How's this :

01:22:10.293 --> 01:22:11.272
Burkhoff

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:14.102
specialized in dormant neural pathways.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.572
He was trying to wake up parts of the brain
that we can't use.

01:22:21.051 --> 01:22:22.566
Parts that would do what ?

01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:26.603
Well, parts that could lead to all kinds of special new abilities,
like...

01:22:26.638 --> 01:22:28.364
precognition.
Right, Marco ?

01:22:28.388 --> 01:22:31.076
Precognition, Telekinesis...

01:22:31.274 --> 01:22:32.765
Stop me if any of this sounds familiar.

01:22:32.788 --> 01:22:35.360
Maia Rutledge.
Orson Bailey.

01:22:35.407 --> 01:22:39.082
You're saying that Burkhoff is the father of the 4400 technology ?

01:22:39.526 --> 01:22:40.817
It's possible.

01:22:40.853 --> 01:22:42.262
And we just woke him up.

01:24:33.499 --> 01:24:36.152
Miss Usher, next door, is getting a kitten.

01:24:36.188 --> 01:24:39.158
Hope she'll let me play despite the fact there's going to be a book about how we all...

01:24:39.193 --> 01:24:41.283
... me and Diana get to be a real family...

01:24:41.307 --> 01:24:42.545
... a computer for Christmas...

01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:47.739
...

01:24:47.786 --> 01:24:51.083
... mommy's bosses...

01:24:51.116 --> 01:24:54.671
Mommy's bosses will be punish for betraying us.

01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:58.781
Mommy's bosses will be punish for betraying us.
