00:57.809 --> 01:00.927
- Where is it?
- May I ask what you're looking for?

01:01.027 --> 01:04.915
- You know what I'm looking for. Where is it?
- Goddammit. That's the last one, okay?

01:05.015 --> 01:07.270
Just take it easy on that shit.

01:09.322 --> 01:11.692
That's enough. Put it back.
Can you do me a favor?

01:11.792 --> 01:13.926
Can you save some for the flight?

01:14.026 --> 01:16.196
- Whatever, pussy.
- What?

01:16.296 --> 01:18.781
- You heard me.
- Call me a pussy again, see what happens.

01:18.881 --> 01:20.548
Pussy.

01:29.574 --> 01:32.862
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I don't wanna listen to it anymore.

01:33.545 --> 01:37.150
It doesn't even matter. We're gonna
be drinkin' 40's on an island soon.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.801
Yeah.

01:44.989 --> 01:46.308
- What?
- Pull over.

01:46.408 --> 01:49.812
Come on, man! Don't fuckin' puke in my car!

01:57.902 --> 01:59.806
Jesus Christ!

01:59.906 --> 02:01.724
Are you okay?

02:06.511 --> 02:08.481
Get it all out.

02:08.847 --> 02:12.685
I told you to take it easy.
Fuckin' lightweight.

02:18.257 --> 02:21.844
- You good?
- Never better, baby.

02:26.265 --> 02:28.084
No more stops.

02:33.339 --> 02:35.608
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.

02:35.708 --> 02:39.266
No... you're making...
you're making it worse. Stop!

02:39.376 --> 02:41.784
Shut up for one second, please.

02:43.982 --> 02:46.235
Nick, stop!

02:54.126 --> 02:56.963
You really are a fuckin' train wreck.

02:57.063 --> 03:00.316
You're the one that decided
to pull into the sand.

03:03.335 --> 03:07.440
Can we, like... wedge a piece
of wood underneath it?

03:07.540 --> 03:11.360
Where do you see a piece of wood
anywhere? Look around. Fuck.

03:13.912 --> 03:17.483
- How far is it to the airfield?
- Thirty miles at least.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.469
Can we walk?

03:25.157 --> 03:27.393
I doubt AAA is gonna be available.

03:27.593 --> 03:31.164
How about you shut the hell up
so I can make this call to Jimmy?

03:31.264 --> 03:34.067
- AAA. Very funny.
- Asshole.

03:34.167 --> 03:37.052
- <i>Hey, man.</i>
- Hey, hey, hey. Jimmy.

03:39.498 --> 03:42.631
- Dog, I got a real problem, man.
- <i>Hello...</i>

03:42.731 --> 03:45.411
You got... hey!
Jimmy, can you hear me? It's Nick.

03:45.511 --> 03:47.313
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

03:47.463 --> 03:49.498
Can you hear me, man?

03:49.949 --> 03:51.751
Jesus Christ.

03:52.051 --> 03:53.302
Nick!

03:55.387 --> 03:58.204
- Nick!
- You don't see me tryin' to do somethin'?

03:59.024 --> 04:00.323
Look.

04:04.763 --> 04:06.649
Who the hell's that?

04:11.203 --> 04:13.422
No, no, no, no, no.

04:14.139 --> 04:15.691
What?

04:21.880 --> 04:23.553
Who is that?

04:39.298 --> 04:41.517
Fuck you. What the fuck?

04:43.235 --> 04:44.741
I got something for you.

04:44.841 --> 04:48.087
- What the hell are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

04:48.473 --> 04:50.310
Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:50.410 --> 04:53.229
Come on! Come on!

04:54.681 --> 04:57.616
- Shoot him in the head!
- I'm trying!

04:57.716 --> 05:00.353
- Just shoot him!
- I need you to shut up for one second!

05:00.453 --> 05:03.572
Okay. Okay. You got it.

05:04.590 --> 05:06.441
Oh, my God!

05:07.760 --> 05:10.083
That's right! Down for the count, bitch!

05:10.183 --> 05:13.081
- Punk bitch! Punk bitch!
- Yeah, you did!

05:15.091 --> 05:16.685
Baby.

05:19.438 --> 05:21.474
They're not as bad as they
make 'em sound on the news.

05:21.574 --> 05:23.120
- No.
- If that motherfucker ain't dead...

05:23.220 --> 05:25.627
- ...he dead now.
- Yeah.

05:48.133 --> 05:50.670
- Are you serious, bro?
- Shoot him in the head.

05:51.803 --> 05:53.456
Shoot him in the head!

05:54.839 --> 05:56.042
Fuck.

05:56.142 --> 06:00.900
- You wanna fuck with me?
- Nick. Nick, it's empty. Nick, it's empty!

06:01.000 --> 06:03.499
Nick, come on, let's go!

06:18.397 --> 06:20.849
Oh, my God, it's gonna break the glass!

06:34.379 --> 06:38.868
Do you think it can break it?
Oh, my God. Jesus, look at it.

06:43.422 --> 06:45.325
Where's the phone?

06:45.425 --> 06:47.860
I dropped it. I dropped it.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.165
- Great. Nick, what're we gonna do now?
- Just wait! Okay?

06:52.765 --> 06:57.103
Give it five minutes.
He's bound to lose interest eventually.

06:57.203 --> 06:58.754
Right?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.864
So we'll just wait, huh?

07:11.964 --> 07:13.989
- Great fuckin' plan.
- Maybe if you learned...

07:14.089 --> 07:16.866
...to handle your shit like an adult,
you would've paid your own phone bill.

07:16.966 --> 07:19.310
Then I could've called Jimmy.
He might be here picking us up right now.

07:19.410 --> 07:22.444
Don't give me that shit.
You're the one who dropped your phone.

07:23.596 --> 07:26.529
Shut the fuck up.
Just shut the fuck up, alright?

07:26.629 --> 07:30.783
Yeah, big bad gangster here, you couldn't
even shoot it from ten feet away.

07:30.883 --> 07:33.306
I swear to God, Molly, if you keep talking...

07:33.406 --> 07:35.875
- What're you gonna do?
- You're really pushing it.

07:35.975 --> 07:39.148
Do it. You fuckin' loser.

07:42.347 --> 07:44.313
Where'd it go?

07:46.585 --> 07:48.691
Turn the high beams on.

07:56.595 --> 07:58.481
Do you see it?

07:59.264 --> 08:01.063
It's too dark.

08:02.033 --> 08:05.000
- Get that flashlight out of my bag.
- Okay.

08:08.106 --> 08:10.009
- Got it. Yep.
- You sure?

08:10.109 --> 08:11.960
I'm sorry.

08:16.281 --> 08:18.133
I think he's gone.

08:33.131 --> 08:35.323
What do you wanna do?

08:35.667 --> 08:38.504
- I gotta get the phone.
- Are you crazy?

08:38.604 --> 08:41.039
What choice do I have?
We've been here the entire time.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.808
There hasn't been a car, a person, nothing.

08:42.909 --> 08:46.579
At least if I get the phone maybe I can
get a hold of Jimmy. He can pick us up.

08:47.079 --> 08:48.508
Okay.

08:49.048 --> 08:50.550
Hey.

08:50.650 --> 08:53.669
- We have to do this.
- Okay, fine.

08:53.769 --> 08:55.270
Okay.

08:56.021 --> 08:57.723
You with me?

08:57.923 --> 08:59.425
Alright.

08:59.895 --> 09:01.443
Shit.

09:06.765 --> 09:08.584
God, it's freezing.

09:09.534 --> 09:11.420
Do you see it?

09:18.810 --> 09:20.696
Do you see it?

09:22.814 --> 09:24.633
Oh, my God.

09:27.352 --> 09:30.469
- Nick, I found it!
- Do you got any service?

09:39.898 --> 09:41.483
Molly!

10:10.895 --> 10:12.781
Oh, my God.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.990
Oh, yes. Oh, my gosh. Yes.

12:53.391 --> 12:55.928
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Jimmy. It's Molly.

12:56.028 --> 12:58.280
<i>Hold on a second. Shut up!</i>

12:59.197 --> 13:00.699
<i>Who?</i>

13:00.999 --> 13:04.036
Molly. Nick's girlfriend.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.440
<i>Yeah. Where's Nick at?</i>

13:07.540 --> 13:09.742
He's... he's just takin' a piss.

13:09.842 --> 13:12.845
Yeah, he just told me to
give you a call, actually.

13:13.445 --> 13:15.581
Tell me that you haven't left yet.

13:15.681 --> 13:18.518
<i>No, no. We haven't left yet, okay?
We're still... we're on the road.</i>

13:18.618 --> 13:20.886
<i>We're gonna cut across the 95
to shoot the shit in the sand.</i>

13:20.986 --> 13:23.069
<i>We're not gonna be there
until like midday tomorrow.</i>

13:23.169 --> 13:26.158
<i>You guys alright? I thought I heard
Nick say there was a problem last night.</i>

13:26.258 --> 13:30.496
No, no problem. No, we're just...
you know, running a bit behind, too.

13:30.596 --> 13:36.681
We probably won't be there
until, like... tomorrow night?

13:36.781 --> 13:39.071
- Maybe the next morning?
- <i>What?</i>

13:39.171 --> 13:41.874
Car trouble, okay? Just... wait for us.

13:41.974 --> 13:45.110
<i>Yeah, okay. Whatever.
You better get here fast, okay, sugar tits?</i>

13:45.210 --> 13:47.847
We'll be there, okay? Just please, wait.

13:47.947 --> 13:50.799
- <i>Tell Nick no promises...</i>
- Jimmy?

13:52.083 --> 13:53.669
Hello?

13:54.953 --> 13:56.539
Shit!

14:04.062 --> 14:05.915
Desert it is.

14:19.477 --> 14:21.589
One foot after another.

14:22.313 --> 14:24.166
One foot after another.

14:25.216 --> 14:27.035
One foot after another.

14:29.254 --> 14:31.240
One foot after another.

14:32.757 --> 14:34.610
One foot after another.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.229
Oh, no.

14:48.139 --> 14:50.192
Oh, my God.

14:50.708 --> 14:53.161
Come on. Come on.

14:57.116 --> 14:58.968
Oh, thank God.

15:31.016 --> 15:34.053
Hey! Hey!

15:34.153 --> 15:35.404
Hey!

18:50.515 --> 18:52.518
Can you smell me or something?

18:52.868 --> 18:54.752
Fuck off!

19:29.119 --> 19:30.972
Maybe you're like a dog.

19:31.956 --> 19:33.699
Do you want it? Okay.

19:33.959 --> 19:36.411
Go fetch! Go fetch!

19:42.233 --> 19:44.519
Get the stick, stupid!

19:49.023 --> 19:52.876
Listen, okay? Get the stick. Fetch. Fetch!

19:53.445 --> 19:55.246
Go get it!

19:55.346 --> 19:57.165
Fuck you!

19:58.549 --> 20:00.052
Fuck.

20:00.152 --> 20:01.870
Oh, my God.

20:13.364 --> 20:15.247
Yeah, you like that.

20:16.335 --> 20:18.671
Oh, so good.

20:19.271 --> 20:22.908
You wanna taste me? Oh, yeah.
You want some of that?

20:23.008 --> 20:25.310
Oh, that's good, isn't it?

20:25.410 --> 20:28.450
Yeah. That smells so good.

20:28.550 --> 20:31.958
You want my blood? Go fetch!

21:20.298 --> 21:21.850
Shit!

21:29.974 --> 21:31.293
Really?

21:46.624 --> 21:49.310
Too slow, old balls!

22:00.471 --> 22:02.908
I don't really mind
walking through the desert.

22:03.008 --> 22:04.877
You know, it's good cardio.

22:05.177 --> 22:08.062
I gotta get that beach body
ready for Mexico, right?

22:08.979 --> 22:11.417
You're never gonna catch me, man.

22:12.417 --> 22:14.235
You're never gonna catch me.

22:42.847 --> 22:45.491
Leave me the fucking hell alone!

23:13.958 --> 23:15.530
Sucker!

24:07.631 --> 24:09.684
For Christ's sake.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.227
Great.

24:26.479 --> 24:28.419
Come on!

29:01.625 --> 29:03.478
Motherfucker!

30:37.521 --> 30:40.044
Leave me alone!

30:41.725 --> 30:43.544
You're driving me crazy!

30:47.531 --> 30:50.017
You're a fucking stalker, you know that?

30:54.504 --> 30:56.374
I have to kill you.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.997
Do you ever stop making those stupid noises?

31:23.534 --> 31:25.753
Close your mouth or something!

31:27.671 --> 31:30.688
I bet you were a real
ladies man before this, huh?

31:31.376 --> 31:33.478
Obviously, you enjoy the chase.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.155
You're just like every guy
that I've ever met at a bar.

31:40.752 --> 31:45.003
Girl says "no",
guy can't take a fucking hint.

31:45.103 --> 31:48.780
You're all fucking gross.
And you think that suit impresses me?

31:50.560 --> 31:53.441
You look like a used car salesman,
fuckin' douchebag.

31:55.433 --> 31:57.485
Your hair looks stupid, too.

31:58.802 --> 32:01.489
And you smell like shit!

32:02.706 --> 32:05.664
God, you were probably, like,
a fucking idiot when you were alive.

32:05.764 --> 32:08.046
I bet your whole family was retarded.

32:08.146 --> 32:13.618
Inbred, misogynistic fuck-ass fucker!

32:13.818 --> 32:15.703
Small dick.

32:18.956 --> 32:20.625
You know what?

32:20.725 --> 32:22.561
I'm gonna name you.

32:23.061 --> 32:27.281
From now on you'll be known as Small Dick.

32:28.098 --> 32:30.017
Smalls for short.

32:31.771 --> 32:33.684
Come on, Smalls...

32:33.784 --> 32:35.866
...why you goin' so slow?

32:36.174 --> 32:39.057
Don't you want this? You want it?

32:39.157 --> 32:41.394
Yeah? Come on, Smalls.

32:44.849 --> 32:46.734
Yeah, you do.

32:49.319 --> 32:51.557
I guess you have one good quality.

32:52.407 --> 32:54.442
At least you don't talk back.

33:00.664 --> 33:03.490
You are one persistent
son of a bitch, Smalls.

33:03.735 --> 33:05.620
I'll give you that much.

33:11.341 --> 33:14.779
Oh, man, Smalls, you should try some of this.

33:15.979 --> 33:17.864
You want some?

33:22.853 --> 33:24.923
You want a piece? There you go.

33:26.226 --> 33:28.025
Eat that.

33:28.125 --> 33:30.377
How much further do you think it is?

33:31.228 --> 33:35.466
I checked the map a while ago,
but I don't wanna check it again until later.

33:35.766 --> 33:37.618
The battery's gonna die.

33:38.228 --> 33:41.262
It's at least another 15 miles.

33:42.506 --> 33:46.994
But... you know, what's great about coke
is that I don't even need to eat anything.

33:48.913 --> 33:52.166
I think I can probably walk
through the night, to be honest.

34:02.325 --> 34:05.496
No, no, no! Look what you did!

34:05.596 --> 34:07.999
Oh, my God, no!

34:08.099 --> 34:09.934
No!

34:10.034 --> 34:11.688
Such a dick move!

35:50.767 --> 35:52.717
Who are you to judge?

36:02.379 --> 36:04.782
<i>Nick, buddy, you're one lucky son of a bitch.</i>

36:04.882 --> 36:07.418
<i>Listen, we blew the engine out
on the twin last night, okay?</i>

36:07.518 --> 36:09.520
<i>But it's okay 'cause
we're gonna swap it out today...</i>

36:09.620 --> 36:11.856
<i>...and we should have it ready
to go by tomorrow morning.</i>

36:11.956 --> 36:15.092
<i>So you and that dumb broad
better be here by then, okay?</i>

36:15.192 --> 36:19.880
<i>Or we're leaving without you, alright?
I'm fuckin' serious. See ya.</i>

36:22.065 --> 36:23.951
Dumb broad.

36:25.835 --> 36:27.888
Yeah, we'll see about that.

36:32.542 --> 36:34.118
Nick...

36:34.461 --> 36:36.357
...the guy that you...

36:37.314 --> 36:39.384
Jesus, that's fucked up.

36:39.584 --> 36:41.504
Honestly...

36:41.604 --> 36:44.006
...I'm not even mad at you over it, really.

36:45.322 --> 36:47.740
He didn't have a lot of redeeming qualities.

36:48.476 --> 36:50.746
I think he had daddy issues.

36:52.996 --> 36:55.700
The truth is, I was just using him
to get out of the city.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.819
I mean, as soon as we got to Mexico
I would have dumped his ass.

36:59.769 --> 37:01.672
Not that it matters.

37:01.772 --> 37:03.858
He was fucking plenty of other girls.

37:05.408 --> 37:07.294
You all are.

37:08.678 --> 37:10.931
Yeah, yeah. Fuck you, too.

37:16.553 --> 37:19.009
<i>I'm so goddamn thirsty.</i>

37:19.589 --> 37:21.392
<i>One more day.</i>

37:21.592 --> 37:23.194
<i>One more day.</i>

37:23.294 --> 37:25.496
<i>I could maybe even make it there by tonight.</i>

37:25.896 --> 37:27.748
One more day.

37:28.665 --> 37:30.268
I'm not quitting.

37:30.368 --> 37:32.537
I know you think I will but I'm not.

37:32.637 --> 37:36.790
I am not quitting. You hear that,
Smalls? I'm not quitting!

40:11.928 --> 40:13.519
Help!

40:18.601 --> 40:20.121
Help!

40:27.277 --> 40:28.863
Hey!

40:30.270 --> 40:32.226
Hey, are you alright?

40:37.620 --> 40:39.249
Ted, get some water.

40:39.923 --> 40:41.425
Hey!

40:41.725 --> 40:43.277
Hello?

40:44.894 --> 40:46.480
Hey!

40:46.896 --> 40:48.715
Are you alright?

40:49.265 --> 40:52.169
- Are you hurt?
- No.

41:01.644 --> 41:03.547
Hey, easy. Easy.

41:03.647 --> 41:06.117
- What're you doing way out here?
- Hey.

41:06.217 --> 41:08.586
It's a... a long story.

41:08.686 --> 41:11.589
I've just... been walking.

41:11.689 --> 41:14.992
To where? You're 40 miles away from anything.

41:15.092 --> 41:17.094
An airfield.

41:17.194 --> 41:21.719
Well, you're damn lucky we found you.
It's nearly 100 degrees out here.

41:21.819 --> 41:23.934
- Yeah.
- Right?

41:24.034 --> 41:26.347
Come on, let's get you to the truck.
You can rest there.

41:26.447 --> 41:29.673
Come on, okay? I'll help you up.
It's okay. Yeah, slowly.

41:29.773 --> 41:32.058
- Thank you.
- There you go.

41:33.142 --> 41:35.029
Almost there.

41:36.646 --> 41:38.865
- Okay.
- Thanks.

41:41.184 --> 41:43.070
Let me get the A/C.

41:53.329 --> 41:54.848
You feel that?

41:55.532 --> 41:57.301
Yes, I do.

41:57.401 --> 41:59.777
- Oh, God.
- Sorry, I'm Ted.

41:59.877 --> 42:02.873
- Oh, hey. Molly.
- Jason.

42:02.973 --> 42:04.522
Hey.

42:04.942 --> 42:08.012
Shit. Fuck. I... I left
my bag back there, it's...

42:08.112 --> 42:10.267
Hey, no, no, no. Hey, it's okay.

42:10.367 --> 42:13.663
It's okay, we'll get it.
You just... just rest. It's okay.

42:13.763 --> 42:15.495
Okay.

42:18.655 --> 42:21.810
- Over here?
- Yeah, I think so.

42:21.910 --> 42:25.746
I lost it in the... sandstorm.

42:28.064 --> 42:29.616
Shit.

42:52.926 --> 42:54.441
God.

43:10.139 --> 43:12.153
Let's get you to the truck.

43:38.568 --> 43:40.387
Found it!

43:42.472 --> 43:44.658
No, you keep the front.

43:47.477 --> 43:50.180
Sorry, it was buried really deep.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.569
Thanks.

43:51.669 --> 43:55.153
Hey, so what was that about... an airfield?

43:56.211 --> 43:58.656
You know, honestly,
I think that they've left.

43:58.756 --> 44:01.091
Yeah, well... where is it?

44:01.191 --> 44:05.196
Maybe they have some extra planes.
I've flown a few times before.

44:05.296 --> 44:07.097
I don't know.

44:07.197 --> 44:09.049
I mean...

44:09.249 --> 44:13.137
...maybe. It... it's a small airfield.

44:13.837 --> 44:16.213
- Only a few planes.
- It's still worth checking out.

44:16.313 --> 44:19.927
- Yeah.
- You know what, guys...

44:20.883 --> 44:24.120
...I really appreciate all the help, but...

44:24.681 --> 44:26.930
...I think I should probably
just get going on my own now.

44:27.030 --> 44:28.812
Wait a minute. We...

44:30.220 --> 44:35.459
I mean, we can't just leave you out here
alone. You could die of heat stroke.

44:37.782 --> 44:39.613
I think I'll be okay.

44:41.464 --> 44:43.008
But...

44:43.484 --> 44:46.887
...thanks again for everything.

44:52.840 --> 44:55.726
Okay, what the hell? Unlock the fucking door.

44:55.896 --> 44:57.574
Unlock the door!

44:58.282 --> 45:00.700
Get her, man! Go around and get her!

45:01.217 --> 45:02.919
Grab her!

45:03.019 --> 45:04.838
Hold her!

45:05.722 --> 45:07.728
Get out.

45:08.825 --> 45:10.888
- The airfield, where is it?
- Get her up!

45:10.988 --> 45:12.915
Alright, I got her.

45:12.995 --> 45:15.259
Alright, tell us where it is...

45:15.599 --> 45:19.003
...or I'll cut you real deep. You understand?

45:19.463 --> 45:21.401
Just like that dumb nigger and his son.

45:22.572 --> 45:27.568
Okay, it's called Boulder's Airfield,
it's like, six miles north of here, okay?

45:27.668 --> 45:30.848
That's a good little girl.
That's a good little girl.

45:30.948 --> 45:33.500
- Please, just let me go.
- Oh, yeah. No, no.

45:34.283 --> 45:37.157
The pen. God, those are real, aren't they?

45:37.257 --> 45:40.063
- Don't touch me! Don't fuckin' touch me!
- Oh, yeah.

45:40.163 --> 45:42.826
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Get her in the truck, now!

45:42.926 --> 45:45.025
- Don't you fucking... no!
- Get in the truck.

45:45.145 --> 45:47.151
- Now.
- No!

45:49.505 --> 45:54.309
Fucker! Get your fucking hands
off me. Motherfucker!

45:55.639 --> 45:58.658
No one's gonna hear you
scream out here, okay, bitch?

45:59.776 --> 46:01.845
- Come on, Ted, let's just go!
- You still don't get it!

46:01.945 --> 46:04.021
Everything has changed,
we can do whatever we want.

46:04.121 --> 46:06.323
We can take whatever we want.

46:06.783 --> 46:09.827
- Now help me get her pants off.
- No! No! No!

46:09.927 --> 46:11.922
I'm gonna fuck you so fucking hard.

46:12.022 --> 46:15.025
- Oh, shit, she's bleeding.
- I don't give a fuck!

46:15.125 --> 46:17.712
- Now get in there and hold her still!
- No!

46:18.212 --> 46:20.166
Get up there and hold her still!

46:21.764 --> 46:24.284
- Hold her fucking hands!
- No!

46:26.636 --> 46:29.088
- Please, don't!
- Oh, yeah.

46:39.482 --> 46:42.335
Hurry up! I'm next!

46:46.756 --> 46:48.775
She fuckin' likes it!

46:53.295 --> 46:56.182
We're gonna have to keep you
around for a little bit.

46:58.173 --> 46:59.782
Fuck.

49:47.136 --> 49:48.655
Alright.

49:51.841 --> 49:53.726
Keep going.

50:02.251 --> 50:05.338
Mind passing me
one of those waters back there?

50:09.859 --> 50:11.711
I'm fine.

50:15.631 --> 50:17.717
I don't wanna talk about it.

50:20.736 --> 50:22.589
It happened.

50:24.140 --> 50:26.159
I need to just move on.

50:30.146 --> 50:32.349
Please, just stop!

50:32.649 --> 50:35.702
I just said I don't wanna
talk about it, okay?

50:37.153 --> 50:39.223
Bad shit happens.

50:40.473 --> 50:42.693
Bad shit happens to good people.

50:43.293 --> 50:45.177
I'm a good person.

50:46.229 --> 50:48.898
You just deal with it and you move on.

50:48.998 --> 50:51.084
One foot after another.

50:58.741 --> 51:00.276
Yeah...

51:01.095 --> 51:02.974
...you're right about that.

51:04.447 --> 51:07.300
It's been a real... shit day.

51:09.752 --> 51:13.409
Make it week. It's been a real shit week.

51:55.264 --> 51:57.117
You got kids?

51:59.568 --> 52:01.655
I wonder where they are right now.

52:03.707 --> 52:05.558
I'm sure they're fine.

52:07.476 --> 52:09.296
They probably miss you.

52:11.580 --> 52:13.917
My older sister,
she always wanted to be a mom.

52:14.017 --> 52:16.620
She... she just couldn't have kids.

52:17.420 --> 52:21.474
Her uterus, it's, like, tilted or whatever.

52:23.192 --> 52:25.412
She was so happy to take Chase.

52:28.197 --> 52:29.767
Chase.

52:30.267 --> 52:34.171
That's his name. He's four.

52:35.271 --> 52:37.157
No, five.

52:39.041 --> 52:41.912
She's a way better mom to him
than I ever could be.

52:42.212 --> 52:44.864
I mean, I'm not cut out for that shit.

52:46.649 --> 52:48.485
Look at me.

52:48.885 --> 52:50.954
I mean, I can't take care of him.

52:51.954 --> 52:54.568
I can't even take care of myself.

52:55.824 --> 52:57.695
Ali and Blake, they're...

52:58.595 --> 53:00.480
...they're responsible.

53:02.031 --> 53:04.917
Yeah, they would have gotten
out of the city for sure.

53:08.071 --> 53:09.923
I'm sure they're fine.

53:11.307 --> 53:13.159
Yeah, they're definitely fine.

53:30.192 --> 53:32.679
God, you're a mess, Smalls.

53:40.169 --> 53:42.022
This is ridiculous.

53:44.540 --> 53:47.226
Why am I even talking to you?

53:47.676 --> 53:49.729
You're a fucking walking corpse.

54:07.896 --> 54:10.116
I'm gonna leave you now, okay?

54:11.734 --> 54:14.587
You're... you're starting to slow me down.

54:16.105 --> 54:18.021
Don't look at me like that.

54:18.541 --> 54:20.393
You're gonna be fine.

54:22.344 --> 54:24.481
Someone will come for you eventually, or...

54:25.081 --> 54:28.504
...I don't know. You'll find one
of your own or something, okay?

54:29.986 --> 54:32.071
What do you want me to do?

54:32.555 --> 54:35.692
What do you want me to do?
You can't come with me!

54:35.792 --> 54:38.662
You're just this stupid fucking animal!

54:39.262 --> 54:41.281
You don't even understand me!

54:42.831 --> 54:44.124
Do you?

54:51.774 --> 54:53.659
I'm leaving.

55:43.041 --> 55:46.415
If I take that tire off of you,
do you promise to be good?

56:03.962 --> 56:06.823
Hey! Stay! Stay! Smalls!

56:06.923 --> 56:08.451
Stay!

56:27.369 --> 56:29.422
You ever play that game Telephone?

56:31.273 --> 56:33.159
It's a kid's game.

56:35.844 --> 56:37.648
You take a can...

56:38.548 --> 56:40.135
...and...

56:40.881 --> 56:43.541
...you attach it
to another one with a string...

56:43.641 --> 56:47.447
...and then you pretend it's a phone
and you can hear each other.

56:47.891 --> 56:49.892
Kids love it.

56:51.994 --> 56:53.913
Chase loved it.

57:00.369 --> 57:02.135
We made them together.

57:08.243 --> 57:10.144
This can's my side.

57:11.046 --> 57:12.632
See?

57:16.018 --> 57:19.105
He had been living with my sister
for a while by then.

57:23.058 --> 57:25.111
Last time I saw him...

57:30.732 --> 57:33.019
...I took my can home with me.

57:39.575 --> 57:41.412
I told him that...

57:42.612 --> 57:44.654
...he'd be able to hear me...

57:45.443 --> 57:47.246
...whenever he wanted to.

57:49.518 --> 57:51.444
All he had to do was listen.

57:57.426 --> 57:59.679
I don't even have a picture of him.

58:02.431 --> 58:04.918
All I have is this stupid tin can.

58:34.096 --> 58:37.316
I wanna be at the airfield before noon
so I need you to hustle.

58:39.201 --> 58:41.220
I'm fuckin' done with this sand.

59:13.899 --> 59:15.922
We're almost there.

59:31.219 --> 59:33.090
Come on, Smalls.

59:33.690 --> 59:35.541
It's this way.

59:53.909 --> 59:56.946
Shit! Smalls, we gotta hide you.

59:57.046 --> 01:00:01.318
Oh, my God. Smalls, come on!
Come on, Smalls, this way! Go!

01:00:01.818 --> 01:00:04.103
Smalls! Come here!

01:00:26.908 --> 01:00:28.925
There's nothing out here, man.

01:00:29.679 --> 01:00:32.782
Convoy thought they seen something.
Let's just check it out.

01:00:32.882 --> 01:00:35.718
Come here, Smalls.
I need you to be quiet, okay?

01:00:35.818 --> 01:00:37.703
Please be really quiet.

01:00:39.422 --> 01:00:41.126
It's hot out.

01:00:41.226 --> 01:00:43.359
It's not as hot as that sister of yours.

01:00:43.459 --> 01:00:47.028
If you even dream about my sister,
you better wake up and apologize.

01:00:47.363 --> 01:00:50.299
Smalls... stay.

01:00:51.933 --> 01:00:54.270
Hey, hey, hey. I thought I seen something.
Just relax, huh?

01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:55.738
- That over there?
- I don't know.

01:00:55.838 --> 01:00:57.923
Just chill, chill.

01:01:00.108 --> 01:01:01.918
- Hey!
- Stop right there!

01:01:02.018 --> 01:01:05.581
Don't... don't shoot, okay?
It's okay. Please don't shoot.

01:01:05.681 --> 01:01:09.519
Ma'am, have you been in contact
with any of the infected?

01:01:09.619 --> 01:01:12.679
No, my... my car, it got stuck...

01:01:12.779 --> 01:01:15.625
...and I'm just heading to the airfield,
it's just right down the road.

01:01:15.725 --> 01:01:17.860
What were you doing back there?

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.297
I was using the little girl's room.
What's it look like?

01:01:21.397 --> 01:01:24.721
It's not safe out here, ma'am.
You can ride with us.

01:01:24.821 --> 01:01:28.771
No, I'm good. I'm good, actually.

01:01:28.871 --> 01:01:30.940
My husband's meeting me up there.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.222
- Your husband?
- Yeah.

01:01:34.142 --> 01:01:37.145
I'm sure you guys have
more important things to do.

01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:39.265
Honestly, I'm good.

01:01:40.148 --> 01:01:41.733
Alright.

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:44.970
- You be careful.
- Thanks.

01:01:47.122 --> 01:01:49.174
Let's go.

01:02:01.236 --> 01:02:05.041
- Stay! Stay! Stay!
- Infected, 12 o'clock!

01:02:05.141 --> 01:02:07.212
Jesus Christ, lady!
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:10.680
Please don't shoot! Please don't shoot!
He's not gonna hurt anyone, he's with me!

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.699
Please! Just... no one needs to know!

01:02:14.116 --> 01:02:15.895
I guess that's the husband.

01:02:16.818 --> 01:02:18.671
You know what?

01:02:19.221 --> 01:02:22.558
You two... you two have fun.

01:02:22.658 --> 01:02:24.394
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Come on, Serge!

01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:26.263
Get back to the Humvee,
come on, right now. Let's go!

01:02:26.363 --> 01:02:29.858
- This is bullshit!
- Let's go right now, that's an order!

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.760
- Let's go.
- You're lucky.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.230
Crazy bitch.

01:02:46.147 --> 01:02:47.651
Smalls!

01:02:48.235 --> 01:02:50.636
I told you to stay!

01:02:50.736 --> 01:02:53.656
Why didn't you listen to me?
You could have been killed!

01:02:53.956 --> 01:02:55.804
Come on, let's go.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.863
Have a nice day, ma'am!

01:03:00.963 --> 01:03:04.340
- You fuckers!
- Good shot.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.702
Okay, Smalls, it's okay. Come on, get up.

01:03:06.802 --> 01:03:10.639
Don't be a baby. Let's go, come on.
You've been shot before. Let's do this.

01:03:10.739 --> 01:03:13.332
Do not be a baby. Let's go, Smalls.

01:03:13.432 --> 01:03:15.887
You got this. Let's go. Let's go!

01:03:19.347 --> 01:03:21.217
You bit me!

01:03:21.317 --> 01:03:23.002
What the fuck, Smalls?

01:03:25.086 --> 01:03:28.771
Oh, my God. Do you...
do you realize what you just did?

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.392
Do you?

01:03:50.692 --> 01:03:52.564
Oh, my God!

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:56.976
Okay.

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:06.009
Look what you made me do! I'll be lucky
if I don't fucking bleed to death out here!

01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:08.491
How could you fucking do this to me?

01:05:08.591 --> 01:05:10.876
I should just leave you here to die!

01:05:15.297 --> 01:05:18.334
Come on. Come on, Smalls. Get up.

01:05:18.434 --> 01:05:20.696
Come on, let's go.

01:05:21.569 --> 01:05:24.090
Come on. Come on. You got it, Smalls.

01:05:28.643 --> 01:05:30.695
What do you want me to do?

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.698
I can't carry you!

01:06:09.451 --> 01:06:11.187
Oh, Smalls!

01:06:11.287 --> 01:06:13.656
Oh, my God, I can see it!

01:06:13.756 --> 01:06:15.641
The airfield!

01:06:24.366 --> 01:06:26.251
Jesus, Smalls.

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:31.123
Come on, we're almost there.

01:06:40.081 --> 01:06:41.934
Come on, Smalls.

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:45.237
Come on. It's not time for a rest yet.

01:06:45.337 --> 01:06:48.573
We're almost there, Smalls, let's go!

01:06:52.093 --> 01:06:53.946
Let's go!

01:06:55.096 --> 01:06:56.916
Please, Smalls!

01:07:27.862 --> 01:07:31.303
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
leave you here like this.

01:08:04.766 --> 01:08:06.585
Thank you.

01:08:50.461 --> 01:08:51.997
Hello?

01:09:00.622 --> 01:09:02.140
Jimmy?

01:09:36.291 --> 01:09:38.183
Stop shooting!

01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:42.566
Yo, Molly!

01:09:43.666 --> 01:09:45.517
Is that you?

01:09:46.334 --> 01:09:48.437
Yes, it's fucking me!

01:09:48.537 --> 01:09:52.158
Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me!

01:09:54.449 --> 01:09:55.895
Where's Nick at?

01:10:02.283 --> 01:10:03.584
Fuck!

01:10:07.021 --> 01:10:10.145
Jimmy's gonna hit that first.
It's 14 miles off the coast.

01:10:10.245 --> 01:10:13.228
All they got there
is two villages and that's it.

01:10:13.328 --> 01:10:15.485
And even if this has spread...

01:10:15.585 --> 01:10:18.334
...it doesn't matter.
I got the full firepower.

01:10:18.434 --> 01:10:22.471
The way I figure it, I go in there,
hard, full fuckin' force.

01:10:22.571 --> 01:10:24.573
Make it my own.

01:10:24.673 --> 01:10:26.541
Jimmy's gonna be <i>El presidente.</i>

01:10:28.444 --> 01:10:30.977
We had our own problems, too.
Tommy drives up in that convertible...

01:10:31.077 --> 01:10:33.318
...that was a poor choice of vehicle.

01:10:33.418 --> 01:10:36.378
Dumb fuck gets bit, doesn't tell anybody.

01:10:36.478 --> 01:10:38.687
Infects four of my guys.

01:10:38.987 --> 01:10:41.807
I had to lock him up in there.

01:10:49.897 --> 01:10:52.635
And this bitch, had a hell of a time
getting it off the ground.

01:10:52.735 --> 01:10:57.418
Every time I go to start it, it blows
a gasket. But I think we got it handled.

01:10:58.307 --> 01:11:00.192
We good, Robbie?

01:11:01.109 --> 01:11:02.741
Hey, Robbie, we good?

01:11:05.179 --> 01:11:06.909
- Robbie?
- What?

01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:10.019
The fucking plane! Are we good?

01:11:10.119 --> 01:11:12.204
Yeah, we'll know in a second, boss.

01:11:14.158 --> 01:11:16.091
Guy's been doing speed for two days.

01:11:16.191 --> 01:11:18.076
He's a fucking machine.

01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:23.446
Is it Shirley? No, it's fuckin' Molly.

01:11:23.766 --> 01:11:25.783
It's Molly, right?

01:11:26.635 --> 01:11:28.653
Fuck, yeah!

01:11:30.172 --> 01:11:33.376
Fuck, it's about time! Grab your shit.

01:11:33.676 --> 01:11:35.734
<i>Viva la Mexico!</i>

01:12:32.966 --> 01:12:35.237
Come on, Ali. Come on, pick up.

01:12:35.337 --> 01:12:38.413
<i>Hi, you've reached Ali and Blake.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:12:39.449 --> 01:12:40.992
Fuck.

01:12:45.245 --> 01:12:47.616
- Come on, Ali.
- <i>Hi, you've reached Ali and Blake.</i>

01:12:47.716 --> 01:12:50.364
- <i>Please leave a message...</i>
- Fuck!

01:12:54.323 --> 01:12:57.976
<i>Hi, you've reached Ali and Blake.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:13:41.069 --> 01:13:42.671
<i>Hello?</i>

01:13:42.771 --> 01:13:44.307
Chase!

01:13:44.907 --> 01:13:48.143
- Chase, is that you?
- <i>Yeah, who is this?</i>

01:13:49.062 --> 01:13:52.114
- It's your mom.
- <i>Ali?</i>

01:13:52.414 --> 01:13:56.718
No, Chase, it's... it's your...
your other mom.

01:13:56.818 --> 01:13:58.403
Molly.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.741
- Where are you?
- <i>In my bedroom.</i>

01:14:03.758 --> 01:14:05.628
You're still at the house?

01:14:06.128 --> 01:14:08.297
- Put Ali on.
- <i>I don't know where she is.</i>

01:14:08.397 --> 01:14:11.533
<i>She said to lock the door
and hide under the bed.</i>

01:14:11.633 --> 01:14:14.987
What? How long have you been hiding for?

01:14:15.087 --> 01:14:18.040
- <i>A long time.</i>
- How long, chase?

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:20.005
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:14:21.342 --> 01:14:25.681
It's okay. It's okay.
You're so brave. You know that?

01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:29.585
Just don't leave from your hiding place.

01:14:29.985 --> 01:14:33.856
Don't leave from under your bed
no matter what, okay?

01:14:33.956 --> 01:14:35.391
<i>Okay.</i>

01:14:35.491 --> 01:14:37.626
I will come for you.

01:14:37.726 --> 01:14:39.348
It's...

01:14:40.329 --> 01:14:43.499
- I'm pretty far away.
- <i>How long will it take you?</i>

01:14:43.599 --> 01:14:46.735
I... I'm not sure. Hopefully not too long.

01:14:46.835 --> 01:14:48.337
<i>Why can't you come now?</i>

01:14:48.437 --> 01:14:51.507
I'm sorry, Chase,
you're just gonna have to trust me.

01:14:51.607 --> 01:14:54.309
<i>You said that before. Why can't you come now?</i>

01:14:54.409 --> 01:14:57.746
I'm sorry, Chase,
you're just gonna have to trust me.

01:14:57.846 --> 01:15:03.585
Listen, I know that I haven't been around
a lot lately but I'm coming back, okay?

01:15:03.685 --> 01:15:06.253
<i>Just hurry, I'm scared.</i>

01:15:06.353 --> 01:15:09.024
Okay, listen. I'm leaving right now.

01:15:09.124 --> 01:15:13.540
I'll be there soon. I love you.
I'm coming. I promise.

01:15:26.841 --> 01:15:28.427
Keys.

01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:31.029
No key.

01:16:28.569 --> 01:16:30.388
Where's the keys.

01:16:31.338 --> 01:16:33.358
Keys, keys.

01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:36.695
Come on.

01:16:40.164 --> 01:16:41.723
Shit.

01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:43.668
Okay.

01:17:44.078 --> 01:17:45.964
Fuck you!

01:24:58.478 --> 01:25:00.064
Chase?

01:25:08.422 --> 01:25:09.941
Chase?

01:25:20.447 --> 01:25:22.871
Chase! Chase!

01:25:24.738 --> 01:25:26.284
Chase?

01:25:30.677 --> 01:25:31.963
Chase?

01:25:32.679 --> 01:25:34.232
Chase!

01:26:48.322 --> 01:26:50.024
Oh, my God.

01:26:50.124 --> 01:26:51.727
Chase.

01:26:52.527 --> 01:26:54.529
It's okay, sweetie.

01:26:54.929 --> 01:26:56.731
It's me.

01:26:56.931 --> 01:26:58.750
It's your mom.

01:27:01.268 --> 01:27:02.637
Mommy?

01:27:02.737 --> 01:27:04.672
I'm here now.

01:27:04.772 --> 01:27:06.624
I made it.

01:27:08.542 --> 01:27:10.345
Let's get you out of here.

01:27:10.445 --> 01:27:12.263
Give me your hand.

01:27:15.932 --> 01:27:17.785
I'm so sorry.

01:27:20.147 --> 01:27:22.224
Why did you leave me?

01:27:22.924 --> 01:27:24.976
I missed you so much.

01:27:25.226 --> 01:27:27.279
I'm so sorry that I left.

01:27:28.829 --> 01:27:30.648
I love you.

01:27:36.737 --> 01:27:39.357
Okay. Okay.

01:27:41.308 --> 01:27:43.160
We gotta go.

01:27:48.882 --> 01:27:50.598
I got you.

01:27:56.823 --> 01:27:58.409
Mom?

01:27:59.443 --> 01:28:00.879
Yeah?

01:28:00.979 --> 01:28:03.464
Are you gonna take care of me now?

01:28:04.431 --> 01:28:05.983
Yes.

01:28:07.834 --> 01:28:09.687
Of course.

01:28:15.475 --> 01:28:17.909
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:28:28.672 --> 01:28:31.922
No matter what happens, you stay behind me.
