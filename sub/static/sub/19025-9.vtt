00:02.160 --> 00:05.072
<i>Mornings in a hospital</i>
<i>are filled with possibilities.</i>

00:05.160 --> 00:08.151
<i>You could encounter a disease</i>
<i>you've never seen before,</i>

00:08.240 --> 00:10.231
<i>make a life-saving diagnosis,</i>

00:10.320 --> 00:12.959
<i>or t</i> ry <i>out the best new nickname ever.</i>

00:13.040 --> 00:15.429
Good morning, Black Whale.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.351
No.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.034
- No to black, or no to whale?
- Just no.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.228
Hey, idiot.
I said idiot and you looked.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.437
You did the "hey, idiot" thing
to me, like, six months ago.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.511
- Did you look then?
- Yeah.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.472
You know what?
I think you're out of ways to bother me.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.751
- No, you're wrong.
- Think of a way to annoy me right now.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.400
That's what I thought.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.314
Thanks for the SeaWorld tickets, Sean.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.470
So you have family in town or something?

00:48.560 --> 00:52.269
- Hell, no, I'm going to sell these.
- OK.

00:52.360 --> 00:56.399
Come here, Aquaman. One more patient
and then we're getting out of here.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.029
<i>Elliot and her marine biologist</i>
<i>boyfriend at it again.</i>

01:00.120 --> 01:02.759
<i>But you know what?</i>
<i>It honestly doesn't bother me.</i>

01:02.840 --> 01:05.114
Sean's gonna let me swim
with the dolphins.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.078
That's great.
I hope they don't maul you.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.390
Relax, Elliot. Dolphins love people.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.715
How'd you get that giant scar
on your leg?

01:14.800 --> 01:17.473
Parachute pants.
It got caught in the zipper.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.118
Right.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.638
You're lying already? I love that.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.154
- It wasn't a dolphin that bit me.
- What was it?

01:25.240 --> 01:27.549
- Black whale.
- You rang?

01:27.640 --> 01:30.029
I knew you'd end up liking it.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.149
Mrs Cantwell, just a quick pelvic exam.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.109
So throw your feet up in these stirrups
here and scoot your tushie down.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.160 --> 01:50.071
Come on, Sean. Let's go.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.837
Shouldn't you at least
buy her breakfast?

02:08.240 --> 02:12.995
You're not the first person to give a
patient an orgasm during a pelvic exam.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.115
No one cares.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.556
I'm sure the two of you
haven't stopped obsessing about it.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.792
Woman, we're professionals.
Isn't that right, Dr Dorian?

02:22.760 --> 02:27.788
52? Mrs Cantwell,
you don't look a day over 25.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.110
Why, thank you, young lady.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.715
- Dude.
- I'm sorry. What's up?

02:40.800 --> 02:44.110
- What's happening with the other thing?
- That's great.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.919
I've never heard a woman
make sounds like that.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.911
I'm sure you haven't.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.753
It's funny. You've never
really satisfied a woman.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.638
You might wanna double-check
with your mum.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.635
<i>Around here</i>
<i>we all make fun of each other.</i>

02:58.720 --> 03:02.395
<i>Except for Carla.</i>
<i>No one makes fun of Carla.</i>

03:02.480 --> 03:06.109
Got a gross of bedpans here.
And where should I pick up my medal?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.189
For what?

03:07.280 --> 03:12.957
For reading your chicken-scratch
handwriting. Who is with me?

03:13.040 --> 03:15.349
I run back and forth for 18 hours a day

03:15.440 --> 03:18.159
between patients who might die
and who will die.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.869
If I find time to write an order
for bedpans, I write it fast.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.871
So I don't feel like being judged

03:23.960 --> 03:27.999
by some guy in his 30s
who still wears shorts to work.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.470
Say the only three words
I wanna hear coming out of your mouth.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.313
Sign here, please.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.355
- Thanks again for holding the door.
- I didn't know you were behind me.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.637
I didn't hear anybody telling me
what a horrible person I am.

03:44.720 --> 03:47.996
- How are the new happy parents?
- I'm living my dream.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.036
Have a great day today.

03:50.120 --> 03:54.193
Hurry home tonight so you can ignore
your son and not do your share.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.795
You make me want to kill myself
and everybody around me.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.632
Come, Dixie.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.837
So, you and Jordan, huh?
You wanna talk about it?

04:02.920 --> 04:06.754
I do, but not here
because I'll probably just cry,

04:06.840 --> 04:09.593
I'm crying, it's too late.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.194
I swore I wouldn't do this.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.397
Come on, Perry. Get it together.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.391
You stop it.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.549
Come on, you idiot.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.831
Hey, fellas. What's the good word?

04:25.920 --> 04:29.549
Mr Randolph, your PSA number's gone up
since your last blood test.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.551
This could be from the prostatitis.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.837
We won't know for sure until
your biopsy results come back.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.595
But I feel pre <i>tty</i> certain
that we're gonna find something.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.515
For God's sake, Catherine,
stop making a scene.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.478
I'm sorry, Doctors,
but she gets a little emotional.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.950
- Are you two WASPs?
- Episcopalian. Why?

04:52.240 --> 04:54.913
You would veto the French Riviera
for our honeymoon

04:55.000 --> 04:56.911
because of the nude beaches?

04:57.000 --> 05:01.073
The point of marriage is that I'm the
only one who gets to see your candies.

05:01.160 --> 05:04.675
I gotta go. But meet me
in the on-call room in an hour.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.035
I have a very sexy surprise for you.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.031
Hell, yeah.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.190
- This guy's sick.
- Thanks.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.878
- You're stupid.
- You're just embarrassing yourself.

05:17.960 --> 05:22.272
- Pick someone else to annoy.
- I don't pick 'em. They pick me.

05:27.360 --> 05:31.114
Loose debris can get sucked up
into the air-conditioning vents.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.318
When that happens, I have to spend
the day crawling around inside the wall.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.039
And I don't like that.
There's not enough air.

05:38.120 --> 05:42.716
I've hallucinated. I spent a day inside
that wall thinking I was a mermaid.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.234
So you don't throw around loose trash

05:45.320 --> 05:50.553
and I won't have to waste a day granting
the wishes of imaginary fishermen.

05:50.640 --> 05:55.270
Dude, I'm not scared of you.
Life's too good.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.271
I'm untouchable.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.315
That's what I hoped you'd say.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.000
Dr Murphy, how about you start us off

06:07.080 --> 06:11.119
by describing the medical condition
of your patient Mr Aronson here?

06:11.200 --> 06:13.475
He's got hypertropic cardiomyopathy

06:13.560 --> 06:16.279
with severe secondary
pulmonary hypertension.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.476
Wrong. He's dead.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.915
Another one bites the dust, huh, sport?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.992
Next contestant. Dr Reid.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.310
Admitted with a COPD exacerbation.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.470
He responded well to antibiotics

06:28.560 --> 06:32.235
but he did develop a rash
on his private area.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.231
- Sorry, on his what?
- His peepers.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.436
- Excuse me?
- His schwing-schwong.

06:36.520 --> 06:41.071
It's bad enough you run out on a patient
in the middle of a pelvic exam,

06:41.160 --> 06:46.917
but you are a doctor and you need to be
able to say simple clinical words

06:47.080 --> 06:49.719
like "penis" or "vagina" or "anal."

06:50.400 --> 06:55.030
- "Anal" is not a dirty word, sir.
- Tell that to my wife.

06:57.920 --> 07:03.119
The biopsy's back and I'm afraid
it's positive for prostate cancer.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.714
Rats. Excuse my language, dear.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.395
I can see this conversation
being riddled with that kind of talk.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.199
Perhaps you should wait
out in the hallway.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.909
Sir, I know that it's cancer,
but I'm not really worried.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.753
Am I confusing cancer
with some other disease?

07:18.840 --> 07:21.752
No, you're not.
Captain Bedside here is trying to say

07:21.840 --> 07:25.435
it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes,
so it's still easily operable.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.432
There's an opening in surgery.
I managed to jam you in.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.911
This is happening fast. You must have
a lot of emotions swirling around.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.356
But if you have any questions at all,
I'm here.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.430
What channel is that Queer Guy show on?

07:40.520 --> 07:42.590
- Tell him.
- Bravo, Tuesdays at ten,

07:42.680 --> 07:44.477
nine Central, eight Mountain.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.274
- Message from Jordan.
- How's it going?

07:51.360 --> 07:53.794
- Just great.
- Hey, watch it.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.838
We've known each other
for over two years. Let me in, OK?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.797
Help me help you.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.668
Stop it. Fine, Newbie.
Let me tell you a little story.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.637
It starts every day at five,

08:04.720 --> 08:07.518
about the time
you're setting your hair for work.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.511
I am awakened by a sound.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.831
Is that a cat
being gutted by a fishing knife?

08:12.920 --> 08:16.913
No. That's my son. He's hungry
and he's got a load in his pants so big

08:17.000 --> 08:19.230
that I'm considering hiring
a stable boy.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.073
I go ahead and dig in
because I do love the lad

08:22.160 --> 08:24.355
and, gosh, you know me, I'm a giver.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.637
And I'm off to the hospital
where my cup runneth over

08:27.720 --> 08:30.280
with both quality colleagues,
such as yourself,

08:30.360 --> 08:33.432
and a proverbial clown car
full of sick people.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.672
But my pay is about the same as guys
who breaks rocks with other rocks

08:37.760 --> 08:40.115
and I only have to work
300 or 400 hours a week,

08:40.200 --> 08:42.191
so, so far, I'm a pre <i>tty</i> happy camper.

08:42.280 --> 08:46.478
Then I head back home, where I'm greeted
by the faint musk of baby vomit

08:46.560 --> 08:50.553
in a house that used to smell like,
well, nothing.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.835
It used to smell like nothing at all.

08:52.920 --> 08:57.710
All I wanna do before I restart
this whole glorious cycle is

08:57.800 --> 09:00.917
lay on the couch and have a beer,
watch some Sports Center,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.993
and if I'm not too sweaty,
stick my hand right down my pants,

09:05.080 --> 09:10.837
but apparently that's not in Jordan's
definition of "pulling your weight".

09:11.040 --> 09:15.158
So, there you are, superstar. Fix that.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.993
That's easy. Just tell her about it.
Tell her everything you feel.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.117
Should I give her every reason
to accept that I'm for real?

09:23.200 --> 09:25.919
No one understands relationships
like Billy Joel.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.116
<i>Uptown Girl</i> got me through high school.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.033
You don't wanna end up
like the Randolphs back there,

09:31.120 --> 09:33.714
not saying a word to each other, do you?

09:35.920 --> 09:39.310
You wish we were
more like the Randolphs, don't you?

09:39.400 --> 09:43.075
God save me, I do. I really do.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.918
Come here.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.676
So, here's your surprise.
We'll be getting married in six months

09:57.760 --> 10:01.355
and I just thought it would be so hot

10:02.440 --> 10:06.911
if we didn't have sex again
until our wedding night.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.514
Can you imagine
how great that night will be?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.910
So great. How about this, though?

10:13.000 --> 10:18.677
How about you stop having sex
but I keep having sex?

10:18.760 --> 10:20.910
- You mean like an affair?
- No.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.309
I'll have sex with you
when you're sleeping.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.551
Turk, how can you not think
this idea is so romantic?

10:26.640 --> 10:31.794
Maybe you got me confused with
that little Amish boy you used to date.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.671
Damn.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.631
Untouchable, eh?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.359
Dr Kelso, none of my patients
have died today.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.398
Really? Mr Ferguson's corpse
begs to differ.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.469
Darn it.

10:47.560 --> 10:51.838
And, Dr Reid, your patient, Mrs Burke,
has developed a urinary infection.

10:51.920 --> 10:56.357
Apparently it hurts when she makes
whizzy winkles through her sea biscuit.

10:56.440 --> 10:59.318
It's not my fault
dirty stuff makes me uncomfortable.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.231
Whose fault is it?

11:03.480 --> 11:06.517
But more important
than never letting yourself get fat

11:06.600 --> 11:11.720
is never let a man put his dirty
how-do-you-do into your bajingo.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.678
Jorge, I need to see you
in the potting shed.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.235
She was always yelling at Jorge
in that potting shed.

11:27.320 --> 11:32.599
But she never fired him, even after he
kidnapped her and took her to Acapulco.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.911
How am I supposed to reverse 2 <i>6</i> years
of uptight repression?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.434
<i>This is a job</i>
<i>for Miss Busybody Smarty-pants.</i>

11:47.560 --> 11:50.677
I know what you have to do.
I'm gonna help you through this.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.551
- Dude, I'm dying here.
- It's 18 hours since you had sex.

12:01.640 --> 12:06.316
- I'm saying, this is torture.
- Why don't you take care of yourself?

12:06.400 --> 12:08.914
- Man, you know I don't do that.
- You don't?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.037
- I only did that like twice in my life.
- Same here.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.509
<i>If by "in my life"</i>
<i>you mean "since I got home".</i>

12:14.600 --> 12:17.068
I gotta go to sleep. I'm tired.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.469
My little newbie dooby-doo.

12:19.560 --> 12:23.075
That whole "telling Jordan how I feel"
thing just went terrific.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.630
Thank you. I need a place to crash.
Where's Naomi's bedroom?

12:26.720 --> 12:28.631
Goodnight, roomies.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.237
We gotta get that lock fixed.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.551
The only lock I gotta get fixed
is the one to Carla's panties.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.154
I need to get a key.
I need to call a locksmith.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.470
I thought I was the locksmith.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.234
Then she cut me off, man.
Just like that.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.436
Prison lock-down. No one gets in or out.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.953
Man, that's tough.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.190
If you're not using my bed,
can I use it?

12:52.280 --> 12:55.955
You may not, on account of this
whole situation being your fault.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.830
You told her that spending the
day with a baby isn't really a job.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.480
You told me to tell her how I feel.
I did just that.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.075
You'll remain on the floor until
you come up with a new plan for me.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.470
You know Dr Cox,
I know this is tough on you,

13:10.560 --> 13:13.154
what with you being psychotic and all.

13:13.240 --> 13:17.313
But I'm out, OK? It's 3am,
and there's nothing in the world

13:17.400 --> 13:20.437
that's gonna keep me
from going to sleep right now.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.915
You changed your mind about surgery?

13:24.000 --> 13:29.313
Catherine downloaded some information
on diet, exercise, seed implants.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.118
Those are, at best, a stall.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.954
I know there's trepidation when you talk
about surgery near the penis.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.191
Quick pause on the gutter talk.
Catherine, hallway.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.433
Look, I...

13:43.120 --> 13:44.189
Go.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.795
There are possible side effects,
but the incontinence goes away.

13:47.880 --> 13:51.953
Sexual dysfunction can be treated with
anything from Viagra to a penis pump.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.395
Penis pump? That sounds aw <i>kw</i> ard.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.232
It doesn't have to be.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.751
It's a giraffe.

14:06.040 --> 14:10.033
End of discussion.
I'm not having the surgery.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.588
I don't mind
that they've shaved me already.

14:12.680 --> 14:17.549
Proportionately
everything seems much grander.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.628
You just have to ease into it.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.110
Let's forget about patients for now
and start with this.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.990
Oh, my God. She's got a tattoo
of a teardrop on her bajingo.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.594
- Is it sad?
- Her vagina.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.832
She has a tattoo
on her beautiful vagina.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.674
This just isn't fair.
Not fair at all. It's ridiculous.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.036
- This is stupid.
- I'm just trying to help.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.829
You know what?
I don't remember asking for your help.

14:50.120 --> 14:53.590
It does look a little sad.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.671
They always do.

15:00.320 --> 15:04.279
<i>We don't have to take our clothes off</i>

15:04.360 --> 15:06.590
<i>To have a good time</i>

15:09.360 --> 15:13.035
This is a hospital.
Why are you playing that song?

15:14.960 --> 15:20.273
<i>We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off,</i>
the classic anthem to platonic love?

15:20.360 --> 15:21.475
No reason.

15:21.560 --> 15:23.790
Whatever you're doing, it's not working.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.555
Of course not. Not with you.
You're, what'd you say? Untouchable.

15:27.640 --> 15:31.189
Well, anyway, back to work.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.633
New friend.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.398
Mr Greenburg needs
2.4 million units of penicillin IM.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.040
Why, does he have a spinkle
in his gherkin?

15:50.120 --> 15:52.918
You're right.
That stuff makes me uncomfortable.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.309
That would have sent me
into a shame spiral,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.914
but now I'm just gonna get over it
at my own pace.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.278
What does bother me is that no one
is ever allowed to make fun of you.

16:02.360 --> 16:06.069
- People can make fun of me.
- What about that delivery guy?

16:06.160 --> 16:08.754
You practically tore him
a new bingle-bore.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.991
But he's not my friend.
My friends can make fun of me.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.548
Really?
You're a know-it-all smarty-pants

16:14.640 --> 16:18.235
and if you're not telling someone
what to do, you're not talking.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.595
I guess I can be a little bossy.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.477
A little? Girl, please.

16:22.560 --> 16:26.189
If you met Jesus, you'd be trying
to tell him where to park his donkey.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.716
Are we allowed to do this? What about
that whole hands on the hips,

16:29.800 --> 16:32.519
Carla from the block thing
she does when she's mad?

16:32.600 --> 16:36.388
"Bambi, you do not wanna
mess with me right now."

16:36.480 --> 16:39.472
- You do sound like that.
- Careful. We are not that close.

16:40.520 --> 16:44.229
Careful. You better be careful,
cos I'm Carla.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.319
Mr Randolph.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.598
What's he doing here?
I don't like these people.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.475
Surgeons, not African-Americans.

16:58.480 --> 17:02.837
- We're actually saying "black" now.
- I was right, Catherine.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.195
I brought Dr Turk to help you
get over your fear of surgery.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.838
I'm not scared.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.469
- Then what is it?
- I don't know if you've noticed.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.119
Catherine and I
don't always communicate well.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.111
- No.
- Come on. You're joshing.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.111
It's true.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.635
But when I lay that beautiful woman
down onto our bed to make love...

17:22.720 --> 17:24.199
Oh, God.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.669
...the walls come tumbling down.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.758
It's the one place

17:30.840 --> 17:34.879
that I can tell her
how wonderful and beautiful she is

17:34.960 --> 17:37.679
and how I would be lost without her.

17:40.280 --> 17:44.876
I know I will probably have to
have this surgery eventually,

17:44.960 --> 17:47.235
but until then
I am not going to risk losing

17:47.320 --> 17:50.437
the one thing
that keeps me close to her.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.875
Not until I absolutely have to.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.073
Yes, dear, you can come in.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.950
<i>Maybe the dirty little secret about sex</i>
<i>is that it isn't so dirty after all.</i>

18:08.640 --> 18:10.676
Could you try to be a tiny bit mature?

18:10.760 --> 18:12.671
This is me mature.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.077
- Excuse me.
- What?

18:16.160 --> 18:20.119
OK, so there's that.
I realised I let you down before.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.876
I was thinking I could make it up to you
by maybe babysitting sometime.

18:26.960 --> 18:31.795
<i>The weird thing is, even though it's</i>
<i>natural, sex can make us uncomfortable.</i>

18:33.360 --> 18:37.876
You have a penis and I have a vagina.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.349
That is so hot.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.750
<i>But if we work at it,</i>
<i>we can get beyond that discomfort...</i>

18:46.080 --> 18:48.833
<i>... and realise that sex</i>
<i>can actually be a comfort.</i>

18:48.920 --> 18:53.118
Hey, baby. A patient made me understand
what romance really means.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.351
So as far as this no-sex thing goes,
I'm with you 100%.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.955
Everyone I know just spent
the last two hours listing my faults.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.156
I wanna have sex, now.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.151
I'll get the condoms.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.470
Sorry.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.469
<i>Sex can even be a cure.</i>

19:16.560 --> 19:20.189
Wait a minute.
Why were you so angry at me?

19:20.280 --> 19:22.555
I don't even remember.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.234
<i>How do I know all this? Because no one</i>
<i>understands how important sex is</i>

19:32.320 --> 19:34.914
<i>better than someone who isn't having it.</i>
