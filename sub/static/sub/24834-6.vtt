00:16.520 --> 00:17.680
-[in English] Bye.
-Have a good time.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.480
Yeah, yeah.

-[upbeat music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

00:21.920 --> 00:22.880
Your mum's a MILF.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.800
Yeah?
I hear your mum's an absolute Doberman.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.480
At least she's not a slut.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.680
[chuckles] He didn't mean it.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.000
-Did you?
-Of course not. Just a joke.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.200
Everyone knows
his mum banged all of Year 11.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.160
[grunting]

00:44.640 --> 00:46.560
Hey, hey. Hey! Stop!

00:47.800 --> 00:50.080
-What's happened? What's he done?
-What's wrong with you, man?

[Tom] Jenny.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.360
Jenny!

02:07.280 --> 02:08.560
Helen?

02:08.639 --> 02:10.400
Helen, can you hear me?

02:12.560 --> 02:13.600
[coughs]

02:15.360 --> 02:16.320
[line ringing]

02:16.400 --> 02:18.760
-[operator]  Which service do you require?
-Fire.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.240
Beech Close, Somerville Acres.
There's a woman here.

02:23.080 --> 02:23.920
She's dead.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.120
Jenny!

02:32.800 --> 02:33.760
[grunts]

02:41.720 --> 02:43.440
Ben! Is she still here?

02:44.720 --> 02:46.240
Is Jenny still here?

02:46.320 --> 02:48.600
[Ben]  No. No, she left.
But the tracker's on the move.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.400
-[sirens wailing]
-What tracker?

02:50.480 --> 02:53.960
She went out of range on Wi-Fi,
but I installed a bypass VPN

02:54.040 --> 02:55.680
that was part of the installation package.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.080
I can track her now.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.680
-Where is she?
-Okay, sorry. Uh...

03:00.280 --> 03:02.760
She's heading east.
Behind the green.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.560
What happened? What have you done?

03:08.160 --> 03:10.000
-Someone's in there!
-[officer 1] Stop!

03:10.880 --> 03:12.160
[officer 2] Get back!

03:13.560 --> 03:14.600
Get back!

03:16.000 --> 03:16.840
Get back!

03:19.800 --> 03:21.080
[siren wailing]

03:23.800 --> 03:24.880
[officer 3] Stop! Police!

03:25.440 --> 03:26.600
-Stop!
-Pardon me.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.960
[woman] That's my house.
Why's he gone in my house?

03:29.040 --> 03:30.600
[officer 3] Where do you think
you're going? Stop!

03:30.680 --> 03:35.640
[Emma] We now know that Chris died
at some point between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.600
Jojo Marshall was staying at a hotel
that evening

03:38.680 --> 03:40.160
and didn't leave till gone midnight.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.520
So he couldn't have killed Chris.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.760
We'll continue to question him.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.720
He's committed
some other very serious offenses.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.240
Sia Marshall was supplying drugs
at the party.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.400
Jojo found Chris and thought
that Sia would be implicated.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.280
So, he tried to dispose of the body.

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
[Neil sighs]

04:02.760 --> 04:04.360
So he just dumped him?

04:05.440 --> 04:07.120
He dumped my baby?

04:07.800 --> 04:09.000
[Tilly] Is this about Chris?

04:09.080 --> 04:11.360
I'll explain in a minute, love.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.200
Can you tell us about your relationship
with Mike Lloyd-Powell?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.720
He's one of my students. Why?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.520
He had a fight with Chris at the party.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.400
It wasn't the cause of death.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.000
We're interested in
why they fought in the first place.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.080
-Any ideas?
-No.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.440
Would he have any reason
to bear a grudge against you?

04:41.160 --> 04:43.640
-No. He can be difficult, but--
-What does that mean?

04:43.720 --> 04:47.160
I don't know.
He's a teenager. He can be spiteful.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.920
Do you think he would have planted
false evidence in your locker?

04:54.760 --> 04:57.120
Someone was watching me at the vigil.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.960
[Sophie] Do you think that was Mike?

05:03.280 --> 05:05.280
-Zoe?
-She said she doesn't know.

05:07.520 --> 05:11.960
You were set up on school premises,
by someone with access to the building.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.080
Mike was your student,

05:13.640 --> 05:17.120
and this fight does indicate friction
between him and Chris.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.680
I don't understand.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.760
Why would someone hate us that much?

05:23.840 --> 05:25.520
-[cell phone chiming]
-Excuse me.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.520
DS Mason.

05:33.000 --> 05:33.920
[Neil] Tilly!

05:34.000 --> 05:35.640
There's a fire on the estate.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.160
We're gonna check that everyone's okay.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.040
Tilly? Stay here. We'll be right back.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.680
-[siren wailing in distance]
-[grunts and pants]

06:08.960 --> 06:10.520

06:11.920 --> 06:13.360

06:22.520 --> 06:23.400

06:49.960 --> 06:50.960
[door opens]

06:52.200 --> 06:53.600
[gasps and breathes heavily]

07:09.080 --> 07:11.040
I'm on the other side of the green.
Where is she?

07:11.120 --> 07:12.960
-[Ben]  She's still heading east.
-An address!

07:13.040 --> 07:15.160
Hang on. Just locating...

07:15.240 --> 07:17.960
Okay, got it.
It's Cedar Close, number three.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.560
That's Neil Chahal's house.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.720
Fuck!

07:47.480 --> 07:49.000
Jenny, are you in here?

08:23.240 --> 08:25.640
-[gasps]
-Leave me alone.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.040
It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.920
Why were you in my bedroom?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.960
It wasn't me. I want to help you.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.120
You've cut yourself.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.440
Let me see.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.640
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

08:42.200 --> 08:46.000
I'm Jenny Delaney's dad.
I'm trying to find her.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.360
Look.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.000
See?

08:53.360 --> 08:54.920
I live round the corner.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.840
It's okay.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.400
I'm not gonna hurt you, I swear.
It's okay.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.240
It's okay. You're okay.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.360
[exhales]

09:08.400 --> 09:09.920
[indistinct chatter]

09:21.680 --> 09:23.960
Come on.
We shouldn't be watching this.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.080
Yeah. It's messed up.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.960
Oh, my God. [sighs]

09:42.040 --> 09:45.520
[Eric] I need to speak to her.
Detective Mason.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.800
It's about Tom Delaney.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.920
[Emma] Pardon?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.280
I saw him running out of there.
I tried to stop him, but he pushed me.

09:56.360 --> 09:57.840
-[officer] DS Mason?
-Yes.

09:57.920 --> 09:58.880
We lost a suspect.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.960
White male, forties,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.440
seen leaving the house
just after it went up.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.760
Okay, thank you.

10:34.760 --> 10:40.000
[Tom] Tilly, I think Jenny's been here.
In your house.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.040
Did you see her?

10:46.640 --> 10:50.280
Someone kicked in the front door,
so I hid in my room.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.400
I came to get my phone after they left.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.520
Did you see who it was?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.760
-Did they say anything?
-I don't know.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.760
Was it a man or a woman?

11:00.520 --> 11:03.520
Come on, Tilly.
Anything you can remember.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.880
I thought it might have been him.

11:04.960 --> 11:05.840
Who?

11:05.920 --> 11:07.440
The man who killed Chris.

11:20.320 --> 11:24.000
Call your parents.
I'll wait till they get back.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.400
I'll be just out here.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.600
-Jenny's not here.
-[Ben]  The tracker's been disabled.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.480
Shit! Shit!

11:38.560 --> 11:41.480
You got a signal
at that last address, right?

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
There was a fire.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.960
What if she's still there?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.280
What if it was someone else
with Jenny's phone?

11:46.360 --> 11:48.520
Someone could have taken her phone?

11:48.600 --> 11:49.880
What else do you want me to try?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.360
Just keep trying.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.440
Fuck!

11:52.520 --> 11:53.720
[breathes heavily]

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Fuck!

12:02.640 --> 12:03.840
[Emma] Thanks.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.760
No evidence of any other victims.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.440
[Sophie] Do they know what happened yet?

12:12.520 --> 12:13.840
[Emma] They're still looking
for the cause.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.600
The hoarding didn't help.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.680
What do you know about smoke inhalation?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.320
Well, it's painful.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.640
The body fights to resist it.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.600
Her body should have been
rigid, contorted.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.920
She was practically scooped
into that body bag.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.320
Darren, hi, yeah.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.440
As soon as pathology
get a look at Helen Crowthorne,

12:33.520 --> 12:35.920
can you tell me if she suffered
any prior injuries, please?

12:36.720 --> 12:38.000
-Thank you.
-Sophie.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.280
Nothing's been taken.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.160
Darren's sending someone over
to dust for fingerprints anyway, so...

12:47.760 --> 12:51.240
Our witness says that you were
at Helen Crowthorne's house.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.440
Yeah, I was.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.720
I saw the smoke
and went in to help.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.720
There's been a fatality, Mr. Delaney.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.240
You need to tell me exactly what happened.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.680
I thought Jenny was in there.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.640
What, in your next-door neighbor's house?

13:15.400 --> 13:18.840
Yeah, I went in to look for her
and the house was on fire.

13:18.920 --> 13:19.920
I found Helen.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.320
But I was too late.
She was already dead.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.720
Did you find anyone else?

13:26.800 --> 13:30.160
[Emma] Too early to say, but we think not.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.120
[sighs]

13:32.840 --> 13:34.120
I don't understand.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.680
If you thought
Jenny was caught in the fire,

13:35.760 --> 13:36.640
why did you leave?

13:38.960 --> 13:40.440
Okay.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.080
Her phone's been off
since she went missing.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.400
It came on this morning.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.200
I traced it to Helen's, then here.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.360
Now it's switched off again.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.560
So, it was her.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.680
She was here.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.800
She was with Chris
the night he was killed.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.600
Then she disappeared.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.080
The day she comes back,
someone else is dead.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.600
That's enough. Go home.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.440
Come on, go home. Go home.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.280
Why your office?

14:20.360 --> 14:24.520
Big four-bed house, they take nothing,
disturb nothing, except your study. Why?

14:24.600 --> 14:25.680
[Sophie] Tom, come on.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.600
[Tom] What have you got to hide?

14:26.680 --> 14:27.680
Someone's after you.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.120
What if it's the same person
who killed Chris?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.400
Or the same person
who framed you as a pedophile.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.720
Do you have to call it that?

14:34.800 --> 14:37.240
She's been targeted at work
and now in her own home.

14:37.320 --> 14:40.960
We can't rule out a connection between
this harassment and Chris' death.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.440
[breathing heavily]

14:42.520 --> 14:43.520
[Neil] Zoe?

14:44.600 --> 14:45.760
[softly] I can't breathe.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.120
-I can't breathe.
-Mum?

14:49.600 --> 14:51.120
What's the matter with her? Zoe?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.320
She's having a panic attack.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.720
Sit down. Deep breaths.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.920
In and out, nice and slow.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.040
Zoe? Hey.

14:58.000 --> 14:58.840
Hey.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.440
-What if he comes back?
-That won't happen.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.160
-I'm sure he's going to come back.
-That won't happen.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.120
I'm sure he's going to come back.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.240
I know who set you up.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.040
[Zoe] He's going to come back.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.960
It's got nothing to do with Chris.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.200
[mumbles softly] Come back...

15:11.280 --> 15:13.800
Look, I did it! It was me!

15:16.280 --> 15:19.200
I put fake pictures in your locker.
I set you up.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.280
We were going through
a rough patch, weren't we?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.840
It was a stupid, stupid thing to do.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.840
I was angry.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.240
-[breathing heavily]
-I lashed out.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.040
I need to get some air.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.440
-[Zoe] No, let him go.
-Emma. No.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.600
[breathing shakily]

15:58.560 --> 15:59.800
What are you going to do?

15:59.880 --> 16:02.160
[Sophie] We'll bring him in
for wasting police time.

16:03.040 --> 16:03.960
He'll be back.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.200
I can hardly see him
skipping the country any time soon.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.960
He knows something about Jenny.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.560
This has got to stop.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.160
-What?
-Making accusations

16:12.240 --> 16:14.880
and getting yourself
into compromising situations.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.520
So if Henry went missing
and led you to a man like that,

16:18.600 --> 16:20.000
you'd just leave him to it?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.160
He's a pathological liar!

16:21.240 --> 16:24.520
You're not helping yourself or Jenny.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.960
He's too involved.

16:34.880 --> 16:38.080
His daughter's missing
and he just found his neighbor dead.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
Maybe give him a break.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.640
Sorry, since when were you two best mates?

16:54.720 --> 16:55.720
[officer] Boss?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.560
[Carrie over recording]
Hi, it's Carrie's phone. Leave a message.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
Carrie?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.119
Carrie?

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
Hey.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.600
Carrie's not here.
She's not picking up her phone.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.560
She's with Josh and Ellen, remember?
She's okay.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.760
[scoffs and exhales]

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
Right.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.520
[Sophie] We think this is Jenny's phone.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.480
It was found dumped at the Chahals'.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.120
[scoffs] It was a phase.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.120
Pink Union Jacks everywhere.

17:56.680 --> 18:00.600
Bedspread, pencil case... lunch boxes.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.320
Yeah, I know.
It sort of became an in-joke.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.720
Rachel bought it for her
on a day trip to London.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.800
It cracked a couple of months ago.

18:14.080 --> 18:18.200
I told her I'd get her a new one,
but she wasn't having any of it.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.680
It's definitely hers?

18:22.880 --> 18:24.080
Yeah, it's Jenny's.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.520
Hey.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.600
Sorry, what do you think I'm trying to do?

18:40.560 --> 18:42.600
-I didn't mean--
-Jesus, Tom, I'm your friend.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.600
[sighs]

18:47.720 --> 18:48.640
If she trusted me,

18:48.720 --> 18:50.600
she would've come to me first,
wouldn't she?

18:52.640 --> 18:54.920
Before she got caught up in all this shit.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.400
She watched Rachel shrivel up and die.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.800
No one should have to go through that.
Least of all a child.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.600
I'd give you a hug, but I'm afraid
you'd report me for harassment.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.520
-[chuckles]
-Sorry.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.600
I didn't want children.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.320
I mean it. I didn't.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.640
I just wanted to be a detective
by the time I was 30.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.280
-And I wanted a Ferrari.
-[chuckles]

19:42.040 --> 19:43.600
But then I met Josh and...

19:44.360 --> 19:46.960
[inhales deeply] the kids happened.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.520
You love your kids.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.200
God, yeah, absolutely.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.480
The minute I saw Henry,

19:55.560 --> 19:57.920
I knew I'd do anything to protect him.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.680
They make us vulnerable.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.640
[Tom chuckles]

20:09.960 --> 20:11.160
[sighs]

20:59.560 --> 21:01.160
You're going to school?

21:01.240 --> 21:02.440
I never want to see him again.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.640
He is your father. He loves you.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.640
How can you stick up for him
after what he's done?

21:08.720 --> 21:11.000
Your father was the kindest...

21:12.400 --> 21:15.480
the funniest, the most caring man
I ever met,

21:15.560 --> 21:16.920
and that's why I married him.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.400
That's why we had you. And Chris.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.880
So, what happened?

21:28.320 --> 21:30.000
Slowly you grow apart.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.360
And one day,

21:33.440 --> 21:37.640
you find yourself doing
stupid, terrible things...

21:39.000 --> 21:41.320
just so you can feel something.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.760
And that's what Dad did?

21:47.960 --> 21:48.920
Not just him.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.680
[Neil through cell phone]  Oh, shit.
Hang on, I put it on video.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.800
[all laughing]

22:18.880 --> 22:20.520
[Neil]  Oh, my Lord.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.920
-Give it to me.
-[Neil]  What a muppet.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.200
Hang on, hang on.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
[laughing]

22:27.760 --> 22:31.200
[Neil]  Look how beautiful she is.
Oh, look at that smile.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.440
Go on, do it again.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.880
-Okay.
-Do it properly this time.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.840
[Neil] Okay. Right.
Get in line, that's it. Here we go.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.640
And now, say cheese.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.720
[all] Cheese!

22:53.720 --> 22:57.320
So, a neighbor saw a black saloon
speeding away from the Chahals'

22:57.400 --> 22:59.120
after the break-in,
but couldn't see the driver.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.320
Someone's had their cornflakes
this morning.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.120
Sorry. Morning.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.960
Did you get a full statement
from Tom Delaney?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.240
Not yet.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.000
We'll get something down on paper
when he gets back from the hospital.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.160
Pete Mayfield regained consciousness
this morning.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.040
You all right?

23:16.120 --> 23:18.640
Yeah. Yeah, I was just thinking,

23:18.720 --> 23:21.600
I should speak to that witness
at the fire.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.960
-Eric Pratchett.
-Yeah, yeah. I'll get on it now.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
[Darren] Yeah.

23:26.920 --> 23:27.960
Yeah, cheers.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.400
That was pathology.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.680
They reckon Helen Crowthorne died
before the fire.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
Skull fracture.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.960
And the fire investigation unit
detected an accelerant at the scene.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.920
So, arson?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.760
And also, this was found at Helen's house.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.480
You're not making this any easier.

24:23.560 --> 24:24.560
[Tom] Hello, mate.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.520
[Pete sighs]

24:33.200 --> 24:34.240
How's the pain?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.560
Don't worry about it.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.360
I'll be fine.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.280
[sighs] Who are they from?

24:45.800 --> 24:46.640
[Pete] Hannah.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.560
In Pediatrics.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.200
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.040
Hannah's a six-foot black man in chinos?

24:55.160 --> 24:56.720
He lives down the road from me.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.040
You can't tell anyone.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.160
Are you screwing him?

25:00.240 --> 25:03.120
Piss off, Tom. I'm not 17.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.120
I really like him.

25:11.320 --> 25:14.360
We've been seeing each other
for six months.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.360
I didn't mind meeting up in secret.

25:19.440 --> 25:21.360
It was actually kind of sexy.

25:22.240 --> 25:26.320
I used to sneak into the estate
to see him through a gap in your wall.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.960
I mean, we don't just, you know. We...

25:33.200 --> 25:34.320
We talk.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.200
We watch telly.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.920
Sometimes, we just sit there with a beer.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.240
I just like being with him.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.120
He loves me.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.680
So what's the problem?

25:58.480 --> 26:01.360
He also loves his wife
and his four-year-old kid.

26:02.400 --> 26:03.400
[Tom sighs]

26:04.040 --> 26:07.360
He hates lying to her.
I can see what it's doing to him.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.240
It's literally tearing him apart. Well...

26:14.120 --> 26:15.960
Now he doesn't have to choose.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.960
Is that what you really want?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.120
It's what's best.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.600
[cell phone ringing]

26:38.040 --> 26:38.880
Hello?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.120
[Sophie] Hey, I have to be quick.
Are you on your own?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.200
Yeah. Why?

26:42.760 --> 26:45.920
They found a coin purse at Helen's.
It's a pink Union Jack.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.160
It's hers. It's Jenny's.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.280
Sophie.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.840
Objectively, it doesn't mean anything,

26:53.920 --> 26:55.680
but if there was someone else
in the house,

26:55.760 --> 26:57.600
we'd be treating them as a murder suspect.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.240
Is that clear?

27:00.320 --> 27:02.080
What are you talking about?
You know it wasn't Jenny.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.320
What are you saying?

27:04.400 --> 27:06.960
If anything happens, I'll handle it. Okay.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.440
We've got a kid at the front desk.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.480
He wants to confess
to the murder of Chris Chahal.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.160
[Tom] You shouldn't be doing this.

27:21.160 --> 27:25.720
Tom, you know, I've been hospitalized
and I've had my heart broken.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.760
You're welcome to buy me a pint.
Otherwise, don't tell me what to do.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.400
-Okay.
-[Emma] Hey!

27:34.720 --> 27:35.920
Have you been discharged?

27:39.520 --> 27:41.280
I need to interview you about the attack.

27:43.440 --> 27:47.080
I'm not being funny,
but his daughter's missing.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.520
A kid's been murdered.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.040
I mean, if you lot were up to it,
I'd be tucked up in bed.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.000
Well, we're doing our best.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.280
Well, do better.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Come on, mate.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.720
He's refusing to speak to anybody
unless you're there.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.160
-He says he knows your son.
-Okay.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.720
So, she's at Helen's,

28:23.800 --> 28:26.080
and we know this because
she left her purse there, right?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.880
Then, allegedly, she goes
to her dead boyfriend's house,

28:30.960 --> 28:34.200
raids the dad's office,
dumps her phone and disappears.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.160
It wasn't Jenny.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.400
Listen, this is what I'm hearing,

28:37.480 --> 28:39.640
and I'm just playing
devil's advocate, right?

28:39.720 --> 28:42.320
Jen went to that party to see Chris.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.040
Chris is dead.

28:44.120 --> 28:48.120
She rings me up for a lift,
which she's never done before in her life,

28:48.200 --> 28:50.640
then she goes off
to meet a complete stranger.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.640
So?

28:52.720 --> 28:53.720
"So"?

28:53.800 --> 28:56.920
So we've spent all this time
thinking she's gone AWOL,

28:57.000 --> 28:58.720
but she's only ever been next door.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.040
Now your neighbor's dead.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.040
[tires screech]

29:08.560 --> 29:09.560
What?

29:11.560 --> 29:12.640
What are you getting at?

29:14.400 --> 29:16.640
We all love Jenny to bits.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.920
Okay? For what it's worth,
I don't think she'd hurt anyone, but...

29:22.120 --> 29:24.280
if you wanna find her
before the police do,

29:24.360 --> 29:28.040
you're gonna have to get used to the idea
that, mate, she ain't perfect.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.320
Get your shit together.
Look at the facts.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.200
Neil Chahal.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.520
When I told him
Chris and Jenny were missing,

29:44.600 --> 29:46.080
he didn't bat an eyelid.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.960
And look at what he did to his wife,
setting her up like that.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.480
He's a control freak.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.720
You remember that text Jenny sent Chris?

29:58.800 --> 30:01.120
"Don't do it. Please. I'm begging you."

30:02.280 --> 30:06.800
What if Chris threatened
to tell the police, expose his dad?

30:07.920 --> 30:10.320
Jenny tells him to leave it,
but he doesn't want to.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.840
Neil goes mad, kills Chris
and Jenny finds out.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.960
God, he knows something. I know he does.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.240
All right.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.600
[Mike] I got into a fight with Chris.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.360
I hit him hard.
He must have died from it.

30:36.440 --> 30:38.160
I was trying to get him off of me and...

30:39.160 --> 30:42.680
When he walked off, he was fine.
He looked fine.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.480
I didn't even know he was dead
until a couple of days ago.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.720
I saw his mum at the vigil.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.840
We know you hit Chris,

30:56.760 --> 30:57.920
but it didn't kill him.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.880
You know that, don't you?

30:59.960 --> 31:02.000
[Sophie] He died from water inhalation.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.160
He drowned.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.400
[exhales]

31:15.280 --> 31:17.640
[Darren] But I'd still like to know
why the two of you were fighting.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.040
His mum's my French teacher.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.200
I was making fun of her.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.280
How so?

31:26.960 --> 31:30.320
I called her a MILF.
He didn't like it.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.360
If we need anything else,
we'll be in touch, okay?

32:11.040 --> 32:12.040
Mike?

32:14.040 --> 32:15.760
Why did you ask for me, specifically?

32:16.880 --> 32:18.800
Don't know. You're Henry's mum.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.640
Thought you might be
a bit more understanding.

32:22.960 --> 32:23.960
Okay.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.080
Wow.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.200
What?

33:08.120 --> 33:10.040
I don't know how you keep it so tidy.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.160
I clean it.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.840
Okay, um...

33:21.400 --> 33:23.400
You just tell me what happened.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.840
When we're done,
you can read it through,

33:25.920 --> 33:27.880
and if you're happy,
you can just sign off here.

33:29.720 --> 33:33.280
You said you saw Tom Delaney
leaving Ms. Crowthorne's house.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.000
Was that before or after
you realized it was on fire?

33:36.880 --> 33:38.040
After.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.120
So, you saw the smoke
and that brought you outside?

33:42.200 --> 33:43.200
I smelt it.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.680
You smelt it?

33:45.760 --> 33:46.880
It wasn't right.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.720
Not like a barbecue or a bonfire.

33:49.800 --> 33:53.640
It was bitter, chemical.
It gets in your throat.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.080
Sorry, would you like some tea?

33:57.160 --> 34:00.760
Shall we just get this done?
Then I can leave you in peace.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.760
I'm old. I'm not stupid.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.080
I'm sorry.
I wasn't suggesting that.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.280
There was a fire at the high school.
Years ago.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.719
I heard about that.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.159
-Some children died, didn't they?
-Yes.

34:24.239 --> 34:25.960
No one was convicted.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.480
Naturally, people felt unsafe.

34:32.800 --> 34:37.560
Eventually, the paranoia kicked in
and they wanted more security.

34:37.639 --> 34:39.560
That's when the gate was built.

34:39.639 --> 34:42.560
Right. To keep the bogeyman out.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.880
Or to keep him in.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.719
My family lost everything that day.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.080
And none of us was able
to make our peace with it.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.480
Leaves a lot of time for housekeeping.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.120
Actually, I will have that tea.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.880
[Pete] Jesus. Poor kid.

35:31.400 --> 35:35.760
I know you've got your suspicions,
but just remember where you are, okay?

35:35.840 --> 35:37.040
Don't be stupid.

36:00.440 --> 36:01.920
I think you know where Jenny is.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.800
Look...

36:09.200 --> 36:10.440
Look at this.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.960
What part of this
is hard for you to understand?

36:17.120 --> 36:18.640
My son is dead.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.000
And my daughter is still alive.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.080
I still have the chance to save her.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.440
[Zoe] Neil.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.520
Zoe.

36:26.600 --> 36:30.440
Neil, where have you been?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.280
-I have something to--
-I know.

36:34.920 --> 36:35.920
I know.

36:40.640 --> 36:41.880
I followed you.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.920
To the same party Chris was at.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.560
How can you ever forgive me?

37:08.120 --> 37:09.640
[breathing heavily]

37:10.520 --> 37:11.360
Who was it?

37:15.600 --> 37:19.480
This could have ramifications
that affect my child. Please.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.080
She was having an affair
with one of her students.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.040
Christ.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.240
That's why Neil set her up.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.600
Which student?

37:45.120 --> 37:46.400
[crying softly]

37:48.280 --> 37:49.160
Hey, it's me.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.480
[Tom] No more fucking lies.

38:13.560 --> 38:15.240
[Zoe crying]

38:27.600 --> 38:28.600
Dinner.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.400
-See you in a bit.
-See you.

38:40.040 --> 38:41.160
How are you?

38:41.240 --> 38:42.560
What, seriously?

38:43.640 --> 38:45.040
It's not a trick question.

38:46.720 --> 38:47.600
I'm all right.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.120
Why don't you come in for dinner?

38:54.920 --> 38:56.040
[chuckles]

38:58.040 --> 38:58.880
Hmm.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.680
You don't come to a party
with your arms swinging, do you?

39:07.240 --> 39:09.080
Next time, you should come to my place.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.720
It's class.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.640
Hey! There's my little baby.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.360
[inaudible]

39:52.280 --> 39:53.840
[crying]

40:25.120 --> 40:26.640
