[sighs]

00:23.291 --> 00:25.333
[foreboding music playing]

00:35.625 --> 00:38.000
My sword. My life.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.541
For Dragon.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.666

01:52.041 --> 01:54.750
Praise the Moon of Mene.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.041
Gather them all.

[gasps]

02:11.458 --> 02:12.291

02:12.916 --> 02:13.833
No!

02:19.083 --> 02:21.291
[somber music playing]

02:26.333 --> 02:27.708
[gasps]

02:28.833 --> 02:30.625
[Invoker] So pale. Fragile.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.791
-Like this flower.
-[gasps]

02:32.875 --> 02:34.166
My lotuses.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.875
[Invoker] No longer your lotuses.

02:35.958 --> 02:38.833
Just as you are no longer worshiped.

02:38.916 --> 02:42.166
All that sustains you
is a spark of divinity

02:42.250 --> 02:44.250
that has never truly been yours.

02:44.333 --> 02:45.500
So clever you are.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.750
You know me so well.

02:47.833 --> 02:51.208
You brought me to this
almost effortlessly.

02:51.291 --> 02:52.500
I see that now.

02:52.583 --> 02:55.750
But there is something else I see.

02:55.833 --> 02:57.041
Terrorblade.

02:57.666 --> 03:00.875
One does not simply ask a demon

03:00.958 --> 03:03.958
to murder a goddess in her own temple.

03:04.541 --> 03:05.916
One bargains.

03:06.708 --> 03:10.250
You carry the weight of that bargain.

03:11.250 --> 03:16.583
You worry what happens
if you fail to meet your obligation.

03:17.250 --> 03:20.750
A bargain with a demon
is no small transaction, it's true.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.625
Then I would like to offer one of my own.

03:23.708 --> 03:27.000
Forgive one another. Restore me.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.791
Allow me to deal with Terrorblade
at the height of my powers.

03:32.875 --> 03:37.041
Not for me, or for you. For her.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.250
Filomena.

03:42.291 --> 03:43.708
Filomena discovered these.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.375
-A hybrid species, unique to this valley.
-[clinks]

03:47.458 --> 03:49.625
I gave them her name.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.458
I will give them your power.

03:53.916 --> 03:55.333
-She will live.
-[whooshes]

03:55.916 --> 03:59.000
You will die, and no one will remember.

[actions music]

04:10.333 --> 04:11.291

[sighs]

04:16.416 --> 04:17.958
[pants]

04:19.458 --> 04:20.583
[Luna] Two lancers gone.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.666
More wounded.
We have no medical supplies to treat.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.375
We have what we have.

04:25.958 --> 04:27.833
Fewer mouths to feed, I suppose.

04:30.041 --> 04:31.958
[Luna] On your feet, you animals!

04:32.041 --> 04:33.625
There's daylight yet to burn,

04:34.208 --> 04:36.500
and at least a hundred spans
of forest to cross.

04:39.291 --> 04:40.500
[grunts]

04:40.583 --> 04:41.500
I see it.

04:42.541 --> 04:43.791
Perhaps we should wait.

04:44.375 --> 04:47.000
A few lost hours won't harm us,
and a rest may help.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.958
This position looks secure.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.833
Also, your wound has reopened.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.666
Again, doesn't matter.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.708
We have what we have.

05:02.791 --> 05:05.208
You're home. You're safe.

05:05.291 --> 05:08.333
But this gets worse before it gets better.

05:08.416 --> 05:09.625
[Davion] You have to let me go.

05:09.708 --> 05:11.083
I didn't know before.

05:11.166 --> 05:15.041
I had no idea
what was happening to me, or why.

05:15.125 --> 05:19.291
You screamed that the whole journey here.
Changes not a fucking thing.

05:20.666 --> 05:22.333
Father is coming.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.333
I'll leave you to the task.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.750
Father. Thank the gods.

05:28.416 --> 05:31.166
I've heard stories
of what you're capable of.

05:31.958 --> 05:34.750
Kaden calls it a curse.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.625
It's more than all that.

05:37.333 --> 05:40.416
There's a demon, Father.
His name is Terrorblade.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.416
He's killing the Eldwyrms,
stealing their souls--

05:43.500 --> 05:46.958
I've been stealing dragon souls
since I was a boy.

05:47.041 --> 05:50.208
Younger than you
when you completed the Crossing.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.333
You were such a bright child.

05:52.416 --> 05:55.000
So talented, so determined.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.291
We need to protect the dragons.

05:57.916 --> 05:59.416
We need to fight by their sides!

06:00.125 --> 06:02.875
I've never slain a dragon
with my own hands.

06:02.958 --> 06:06.958
[Father] Never made the Blade Bond.
Injury made that impossible.

06:07.708 --> 06:11.666
But I was clever.
I learned the secrets of the forge-men.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.708
"Cursed", Kaden said.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.916
[metal whooshes]

06:16.791 --> 06:20.166
What I would not have given
to be cursed like you.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.750
[nervous groan]

06:21.833 --> 06:27.083
[Ritterfau] Put your back into it, boy!
Luminous scales show every smudge.

06:27.750 --> 06:29.458
-[background chatter]
-When I was a squire,

06:29.541 --> 06:32.208
it was an honor
to polish a father's boots.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.708
More than one evening, I went to my rack,

06:34.791 --> 06:38.583
my hand frozen in a claw
from gripping the rag.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.041
Ha!

06:40.125 --> 06:43.375
Hunched over
like a hellbear with the shits.

06:43.458 --> 06:44.500
[door closes]

06:44.583 --> 06:46.916
-[indistinct chatter]
-[suspenseful music]

06:47.875 --> 06:49.000
[Ritterfau] Kaden.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.625
Forgotten your manners already?

06:55.625 --> 06:58.250
Master Ritterfau. Apologies.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.583
Oh, I can't blame you.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.583
Twenty years, has it been?

07:03.291 --> 07:06.833
Barely here, but to haul carcasses
in and take weapons out.

07:06.916 --> 07:08.750
Twenty years.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.125
Twenty-two.

07:10.208 --> 07:12.083
Hunting Slyrak.

07:12.166 --> 07:16.125
All that time,
just to bring us one of our own.

07:16.208 --> 07:17.666
Under the ankle, damn it!

07:19.750 --> 07:22.291
You certainly made a name for yourself

07:22.375 --> 07:25.833
while the rest of us did the work
we're expected to do.

07:25.916 --> 07:27.958
We are a brotherhood. A unit.

07:28.041 --> 07:32.083
No man more important than the rest.
Like this boy here.

07:32.166 --> 07:33.375
Happy to be part of the team.

07:33.458 --> 07:36.125
I didn't say you could speak.

07:36.208 --> 07:39.583
-[thuds]
-Twenty-two years, Kaden. Wasted.

07:41.083 --> 07:43.333
[indistinct murmuring]

07:45.291 --> 07:49.333
Blood on my boots.
Never polished. Never cared to.

07:49.416 --> 07:53.166
Not in 22 years, Master Ritterfau.

07:54.916 --> 07:56.916
[retreating footsteps]

07:58.250 --> 08:00.291

[screaming continues]

08:08.291 --> 08:09.500
[Davion grunts]

08:10.125 --> 08:13.500
I'm afraid penetrating bone
can be excruciating.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.625
But it's necessary.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.541
[Davion whimpers]

08:18.750 --> 08:19.875
[Davion coughs]

[gasps]

08:23.333 --> 08:25.375
[sudden music sting]

08:26.458 --> 08:28.666
You told me he would not be harmed.

08:28.750 --> 08:32.916
Harm and pain are brothers,
but they live apart.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.333
[Davion grunts]

08:34.416 --> 08:37.958
I tried what you're trying now.
It didn't fucking work.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.083
Made it worse.

08:39.791 --> 08:43.083
I broke his trust.
I won't break that trust again.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.041
Remember, Davi, you are loved.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.208
[panting]

08:50.291 --> 08:53.458
Kaden. They're not just animals.

08:54.166 --> 08:58.958
Nor am I. See to his comfort.
Find me in the Great Hall when it's done.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.791
-[owl hoots]
-[footsteps approaching]

09:07.958 --> 09:08.916
Marcy.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.750
[suspenseful music playing]

09:16.458 --> 09:17.625
[Mirana] It's a sign.

09:18.333 --> 09:20.625
[Luna scoffs]
Grave marker.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.041
-We make camp here.
-[Sagan growls]

09:23.125 --> 09:25.500
The gods can be sick bastards.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.166
-[wolf howls]
-[crickets creak]

09:32.625 --> 09:34.666
You should join them. Worship.

09:34.750 --> 09:38.583
The ley lines are down,
our gifts are gone, Selemene falls silent.

09:39.291 --> 09:43.541
When I look to the moon,
all I feel is the empty sky.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.166
Pointless ritual.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.708
[Mirana] Or perhaps it's the opposite.

09:48.291 --> 09:51.958
The Dark Moon Order know Selemene is gone,
but they believe in her anyway.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.291
That isn't pointless.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.166
That's what hope is.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.083
That's faith.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.333
[scoffs]

09:59.000 --> 10:00.125
Faith.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.666
Selemene had faith in the Invoker.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.000
He betrayed it.

10:04.083 --> 10:06.291
That doesn't mean
she was wrong to offer it.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.375
Selemene offered nothing.

10:09.208 --> 10:10.541
I never asked her.

10:10.625 --> 10:12.500
Never sought her council.

10:13.916 --> 10:18.375
I accepted the lotuses
because I wanted to go home,

10:18.458 --> 10:20.666
and I was afraid our lady would say no.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.333
[inhales deeply]
I didn't have any faith at all.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.833
Still think I should join them?

10:29.833 --> 10:31.958
[wind whooshing]

10:32.583 --> 10:34.000
[groans]

10:35.125 --> 10:36.041
[Davion sighs]

10:37.500 --> 10:38.333
[sighs]

10:38.416 --> 10:39.666
I thought you might want that.

10:40.541 --> 10:41.458
[grunts]

10:41.541 --> 10:43.833
What are these made of?

10:43.916 --> 10:45.416
-[grunts]
-[electricity crackles]

10:45.500 --> 10:46.750
Something you won't break.

10:47.458 --> 10:51.000
What in the seven hells
were you even thinking, following me here?

10:51.083 --> 10:54.208
I had to help you.
You're, you're my people.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.208
I thought your people
were back in Coedwig.

10:57.291 --> 11:01.125
-[thudding]
-Cochi. They didn't need me. You did.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.708
[groans]

11:02.791 --> 11:05.333
I barely remember any of it. It's a fog.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.958
I ran into the fight. It was bad.

11:11.375 --> 11:14.750
Mirana. Is she… is she all right?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.750
She got out of the worst of it.

11:17.833 --> 11:20.333
Beyond that, I, I just don't know.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.958
I wish I did. I wish I could say.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.750
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.

11:27.625 --> 11:28.458
Except…

11:29.416 --> 11:31.666
-Except it is my fault.
-Fymryn.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.708
I knew it was gonna happen.

11:33.791 --> 11:36.833
I knew and I let it. I, I did nothing.

11:36.916 --> 11:38.166
I was even happy.

11:38.916 --> 11:42.166
At first, then, it didn't feel
the way I hoped it would.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.625
-It felt ugly.
-You knew.

11:45.708 --> 11:48.125
I was supposed to bring you back
to the tower after it all happened.

11:48.208 --> 11:53.291
That's why you followed me. He did this.
You're still helping him.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.833
No! No, it's not that way!

11:55.916 --> 11:56.958
Get out.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.416
-Please!
-Maybe Father is right.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.208
Maybe his way is the way.

12:02.041 --> 12:05.666
I've trusted him my whole life,
since I was a boy.

12:05.750 --> 12:09.166
But you… I barely know you.

12:09.791 --> 12:11.625
Get out!

12:11.708 --> 12:14.041
[dramatic music playing]

12:16.125 --> 12:19.833
I love my family,
but you're my people too.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.416
[groans]

12:24.416 --> 12:25.541
[creature slurping]

12:26.500 --> 12:27.333
[Davion grunts]

12:29.125 --> 12:30.125
[Father] Curious.

12:30.208 --> 12:35.583
Your healing is extraordinary.
Fast. Complete.

12:35.666 --> 12:36.500
[Davion grunts]

12:36.583 --> 12:38.666
Trust me. It still hurts.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.958
Pain can be controlled.

12:41.875 --> 12:45.166
So, how does all of this get
the big red dragon out of me?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.041
[Father] It's a quietly held belief
among some,

12:50.708 --> 12:52.750
heretical in these halls…

12:53.833 --> 12:57.750
that certain among us
carry dragon traits in our blood.

12:57.833 --> 13:02.083
No one knows how this Dragon Clan
might have come to be.

13:02.791 --> 13:06.208
But it's difficult to argue
against its existence.

13:06.291 --> 13:13.166
Rylai, the warden of Icewrack herself,
manifests some features of a water dragon.

13:13.250 --> 13:18.541
Her sister, Lina?
Seems more ember dragon than human.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.333
This may be why you change.

13:21.416 --> 13:25.000
This may be why any of this
is possible at all.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.416
This is who you really are.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.666
Dragon clan.

13:30.375 --> 13:36.500
It means that monster inside you
may be more Davion than Slyrak.

13:37.166 --> 13:40.083
It means you may be joined forever.

13:40.916 --> 13:42.875
Isn't it wonderful?

13:42.958 --> 13:45.125
[foreboding music playing]

13:50.125 --> 13:52.333
[wind howling]

13:53.458 --> 13:54.916
Uh, Father?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.708
Kaden says Davian needs to eat.

13:58.375 --> 14:02.541
Eat? Oh, yes. Maintain your strength.

14:08.625 --> 14:09.583
[Davion] Bram?

14:10.125 --> 14:13.833
-Yeah. Hi. So…
-Hi.

14:14.875 --> 14:18.416
Guess you made it back to Dragon Hold,
warned the fathers. All that.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.375
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was a little worried,
I came through the portal

14:21.458 --> 14:23.375
with someone else's left foot.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.833
I stared at it for days before I decided
it was just a little swollen and--

14:26.916 --> 14:27.833
Bram.

14:27.916 --> 14:29.625
I hate those things.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.166
Everyone does.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.291
Listen.

14:33.958 --> 14:35.708
You did what I asked you to do.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.083
Then you did what you thought was right.

14:38.916 --> 14:42.375
You're my best friend.
None of this changes that for me.

14:43.333 --> 14:47.666
Me either.
Here. Dragon's fire whiskey. For you.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.958
-Best damn squire in Dragon Hold.
-[Bram] Davion?

14:53.208 --> 14:56.041
You're not gonna eat me, are you?

14:56.125 --> 14:57.125
[Davion] Probably not.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.125
-But maybe.
-[Bram] I appreciate the honesty.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.000
[metal clanking]

15:08.166 --> 15:09.250
[door opens, closes]

15:13.541 --> 15:15.750
[foreboding music playing]

15:16.541 --> 15:20.083
And that's when I said,
"Look! It's an Eldwyrm, okay?

15:20.166 --> 15:23.208
This animal requires
expert handling and--"

15:23.291 --> 15:24.250
What?

15:25.625 --> 15:28.041
[foreboding music playing]

15:36.000 --> 15:38.958
Brother Kaden. Father requests you.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.083
[clattering]

15:46.500 --> 15:48.833
[metal clanking]

15:50.583 --> 15:51.583
[knocking on door]

15:53.375 --> 15:54.458
Everyone out.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.125
[Father] I would have words with you.

15:57.750 --> 15:58.583
[door closes]

15:58.666 --> 16:00.000
You don't approve of my efforts.

16:01.041 --> 16:05.541
You feel you owe Davion a debt of honor.
I will never question that.

16:06.708 --> 16:10.500
But each Dragon Knight
gladly bleeds for the cause.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.958
Few have bled as you have bled.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.250
None more.

16:15.333 --> 16:22.291
[Father] For 20 years, you and I forged
you into the weapon you had to become.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.833
Piece by piece. Blade by blade.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.125
I have never asked anything of you
other than your trust.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.583
That is all I ask now.

16:32.416 --> 16:33.416
Your trust.

16:34.708 --> 16:39.541
This is Davion's blood.
Extracted. Transformed.

16:40.750 --> 16:45.208
A weapon of a different sort. Imagine.

16:45.875 --> 16:50.125
Our brothers enhanced with Davion's power.

16:50.208 --> 16:54.333
A dragon's power. Dragon's resilience.

16:55.333 --> 17:00.291
We could heal our wounded,
regenerate limbs.

17:00.375 --> 17:03.125
Perhaps, restore the dead.

17:03.708 --> 17:08.500
I've dreamed of slaying dragons
since I was a boy.

17:09.458 --> 17:13.625
With this? I could slay them all.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.833
That boy is more than a boy.

17:18.541 --> 17:22.958
He is an unlimited resource.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.791
No more Leathshams.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.166
Kaden?

17:29.500 --> 17:30.375
Kaden!

17:34.875 --> 17:36.125
[breathes heavily]

17:37.041 --> 17:38.166
[sighs]

17:40.125 --> 17:42.708
[Luna] The Coedwei
are herding us like sheep.

17:43.375 --> 17:47.958
Trying to push us into this narrow pass
between the air dragon hunting ground

17:48.541 --> 17:51.208
and frozen peaks
we have no tools to cross.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.750
So, they seal both ends
of the pass and envelop us.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.041
-Trap us.
-Mm. Worse.

17:57.125 --> 18:01.458
They can put archers on the ridgeline.
It's a killing field.

18:02.541 --> 18:05.666
I once did the same
to an errant Helio Imperium patrol.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.833
A hundred men. They never saw home again.

18:08.916 --> 18:11.500
Then we have to make a stand.
We have to fight.

18:11.583 --> 18:15.708
[scoffs]
Brave. Also suicidal.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.208
We send a small harassing force
to the rear.

18:19.291 --> 18:21.875
Confuse and scatter them. Delay them.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.666
While they consolidate,
you escape through the pass.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.125
"You"? You mean, "We."

18:27.208 --> 18:29.041
I mean, you.

18:29.125 --> 18:32.708
The harassing force I intend is me.
Just me.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.125
You're in no condition.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.750
Which makes me expendable.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.958
I'll take Sagan. Leave before first light.
Have the troops ready.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.583
You're wrong about one thing.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.708
You didn't trust the goddess,

18:46.791 --> 18:49.083
but I'm the one who trusted the Devil.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.583
We are both responsible for this.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.458
Faith.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.750
[dramatic music playing]

19:04.291 --> 19:07.041

[grunts]

19:16.083 --> 19:17.208
[groans]

19:17.833 --> 19:18.833
Whoa!

19:19.500 --> 19:22.583
[screams]

19:24.541 --> 19:25.583
[groans]

19:28.083 --> 19:29.208

[grumbles]

19:47.666 --> 19:50.333
[shudders]

19:51.083 --> 19:54.458
No! No, no, no, no, no!

19:55.125 --> 19:57.958
[cries]

20:01.208 --> 20:02.750
[panting]

20:04.791 --> 20:07.125
I need more.

20:09.916 --> 20:11.500
[Davion] I told you to get out!

20:11.583 --> 20:12.750
Quiet. Listen.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.458
These people are not your friends.

20:14.541 --> 20:16.333
[Davion] These people are my family!

20:18.916 --> 20:20.416
In the seven hells are you doing?

20:20.500 --> 20:23.791
Probably nothing. Hopefully something.

20:24.541 --> 20:26.708
-[electricity crackles]
-[grunts]

20:26.791 --> 20:28.833
[Fymryn groaning]

20:31.291 --> 20:33.416
[screaming]

20:34.291 --> 20:35.500
[Davion groans]

20:35.583 --> 20:37.166
[Davion] That was definitely something.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.291
Praise, Mene! I can get us out.

20:43.541 --> 20:46.208
[gasping]

[suspenseful music playing]

21:22.750 --> 21:23.958

Sagan?

21:24.750 --> 21:27.458
Sagan, komi. Sagan!

21:29.625 --> 21:31.791
[scoffs]
Crazy, stupid girl.

-Up. All of you.
-[soldier 1] On your feet!

22:15.625 --> 22:17.416
-This is our chance!
-[soldier 2] Grab your weapon!

22:17.500 --> 22:20.083
The princess left
so I can lead you to safety.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.041
Which is what you will do.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.541
I will bring Mirana back alive.

22:26.625 --> 22:28.875
[soldier 3] A rider! A rider approaches!

22:28.958 --> 22:30.958
[foreboding music playing]

22:36.916 --> 22:40.208
[Mirana] We have our moment. We take it.

22:40.291 --> 22:42.083
We move!

22:42.875 --> 22:46.458
[soldiers chanting]
For the Goddess! For the Princess!

22:46.541 --> 22:47.875
Faith.

[soft chuckle]

22:54.958 --> 22:56.958
[suspenseful music playing]

23:03.125 --> 23:04.375
[Fymryn] We need to go.

23:05.041 --> 23:07.125
I'm not leaving.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.750
Davion. Dragon Knight.

23:10.291 --> 23:13.541
I have come to collect what belongs to me.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.291
[Fymryn cries]
