with these three darlings.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.207
Jane's been finding her voice
as a writer...

00:06.240 --> 00:07.541
- Even if--
- Hang on, just let me finish.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.077
- And discovered
people listen...

00:09.110 --> 00:10.178
- What you did say
really resonated.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.080
- So she better be good.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.814
Sutton got creative,
going after a job in fashion...

00:13.847 --> 00:15.616
- Your opening move in our
relationship was to lie to me.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.118
- When all she really had to do
was be herself.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.386
- It's real.
Real is good.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.089
Go tell Lauren
I pushed her assistant.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.623
- And Kat had to
throw her hat in the ring

00:22.656 --> 00:24.258
and run a few red lights...
[siren chirps]

00:24.292 --> 00:27.261
- [groans]
- To get what she really wanted.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.630

00:40.174 --> 00:42.176
- I can't believe Kat
didn't wanna come tonight.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.146
This is so up her alley.
- Seriously--well, her loss.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.081
- And you didn't wanna
invite Pinstripe?

00:47.115 --> 00:48.282
- Uh, he's got an early flight
he's covering,

00:48.316 --> 00:50.251

in Florida.

00:50.284 --> 00:53.521
Anyways, tonight is
about me, my ladies,

00:58.226 --> 01:00.528
for Morgyn Stanley to read
the profile I wrote on her.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.296
- Morgyn Stanley.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.165
- With a Y.
- [chuckles]

Ooh, that's her.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.535

who left Wall Street

01:08.902 --> 01:10.271
to become a stripper?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.173
- She says
this is more empowering.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.574
*

01:13.607 --> 01:15.676
- It's also
incredibly intimidating.

- She has a great take
on feminism.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.712

01:18.746 --> 01:20.648
- Okay, seriously,
so intimidating.

01:20.681 --> 01:25.286

over me *

So do you pray every day?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.669
- Uh, most days.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.271
Some days I'm lazy

02:50.304 --> 02:52.506
and don't do all five salats.

But some days it feels, um...

more important than others.

I'm not a cheater.
I-I didn't think I was.

- Well, I mean, we didn't--

you know, we didn't
have sex, so...

03:28.342 --> 03:29.743
[giggles]

03:29.777 --> 03:30.744
- Is that how
you delineate cheating?

03:30.778 --> 03:35.683
Just sex?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.618
If I'm being honest with myself,

03:37.651 --> 03:40.721
I have been cheating
for a while,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.690
probably since I decided

03:42.723 --> 03:44.792
to pursue a friendship
with you,

03:44.825 --> 03:48.028
knowing that my feelings
were not entirely

03:48.061 --> 03:49.630

It was such a positive article.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.833
- It was very positive.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.801
- I mean, giving up a six-figure
salary on Wall Street

04:27.835 --> 04:30.704
and finding true empowerment
as a stripper,

04:30.738 --> 04:32.340
that's inspiring.
- Yeah.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.442
- I painted her
as a feminist hero.

- Yeah, RBG, Oprah,
Morgyn Stanley.

Look, not everybody's
gonna love

04:38.879 --> 04:41.749
everything you write,
besides me.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.686
But forget Morgyn.
Can we talk about my new shoes?

04:45.719 --> 04:47.555
- Mew-mew.
- The new spring collection,

04:47.588 --> 04:49.757
and totally out of
my price range,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.793
but I'm signing my official
start papers with Oliver today,

04:52.826 --> 04:54.928
and I felt like I had to step up
my fashion game, you know?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.097
- Stop making excuses.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.700
You rewarded yourself,
which you totally deserve to do.

major to tell you.

- Yeah,
that's what I have to tell you.

'Cause I have to go sign

05:07.641 --> 05:08.876

last night.

I went to Adena's last night,

05:21.655 --> 05:25.359
and we kissed for, like, hours,
and then I stayed the night...

05:25.393 --> 05:26.827

breaking up with her girlfriend,

a little complicated,

off your desk,

which you're sharing with
three other people.

your signature on this.

- Um, the starting salary,

06:23.984 --> 06:27.821
it's just a little bit
lower than...

06:27.855 --> 06:29.823
I was expecting.

- Well, you're gonna
make yourself crazy

when you have nothing
to apologize for.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.799

- Do not take this personally.

I took a look at my assets,
I assigned a value,

- No, you look really stupid.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.366
- Try it.
- No.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.869

09:28.902 --> 09:30.971
- Hands on the hips.
Okay, deep breath in...

09:31.004 --> 09:32.606
- [inhales]
- Chest up.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.809
*

09:35.843 --> 09:38.779
Ooh, see,
this girl is terrifying.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.780
I would give her
anything she wants.

09:39.813 --> 09:40.781
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.015
- How about this girl?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.050
- Oh--okay...
- [hisses]

09:43.083 --> 09:44.785
- Okay, maybe just--

09:44.818 --> 09:45.953
maybe just go back down to the--

09:45.986 --> 09:47.955
Ooh, wow, okay.
- [laughs]

09:47.988 --> 09:49.890
- Let's go back to
that power pose.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.124
It's not--no, no,
go back to the original--

09:51.158 --> 09:52.793
- Hello?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.161
- Hi.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.663
- I reserved
the conference room.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.897
- Of course...
- Hm.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.699
- All yours.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.038
- According to the complaint,

10:05.072 --> 10:07.808
your article outed her identity.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.943
- [scoffs]
I kept her anonymous.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.079
- She's claiming you used
too many identifying details.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.947
- That's ridiculous.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.784
She said I could do the article
if I used her stage name.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.018
I should just go talk to her,
'cause I'm sure I could--

10:18.051 --> 10:19.987
- No--no, you don't
wanna do that.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.055
Why don't we just go through
the recording of the interview?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.924
- I don't have one.
The club wouldn't allow

10:23.957 --> 10:25.993
recording devices inside
to protect the dancers,

10:26.026 --> 10:28.729
but I took handwritten notes.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.063
- Okay.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.705
- There was a bachelor party
nearby,

10:37.738 --> 10:39.873
and one of the guys spilt beer
all over my notes,

10:39.907 --> 10:41.975
but I transcribed them
when I got home.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.177
Everything we discussed is here.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.814
I was thorough.
- I'll tell you what,

10:46.847 --> 10:48.882
I'm gonna take a look
at these over lunch,

10:48.916 --> 10:50.450
and I'll get back to you, okay?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.886
[solemn music]

10:52.920 --> 10:54.788
- Um...

10:54.822 --> 10:57.691
how big of a deal is this?
- She's just chasing money.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.993
She saw an opportunity,
and she's going for it.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.964

- Hey.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.077
Did you talk to Oliver yet?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.846
- Not till he gets back
from his facial.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.113
- Ooh, fancy.
- What's all this?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.949
Is this for
the Soul Wheel event?

11:21.982 --> 11:24.484
- Yeah.
- Are there extras?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.886
- [laughs]

11:25.919 --> 11:27.755
Hopefully not,
once I get my numbers up.

11:27.788 --> 11:28.989
I'm Twitter storming.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.490
- Yeah, I can feel
the vibes over here.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.926
Like, very intense.
- [laughs]

11:32.960 --> 11:35.028
I already got a few whackos
trickling in.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.830
- Okay, why must we assume

11:36.864 --> 11:38.799
that everybody who does
Soul Wheel is a whacko?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.968
- Uh, do we really need
New Age philosophy

11:41.001 --> 11:43.871
screamed at us while we sweat?
It's off-putting.

Oh, it's Adena.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.477

- Okay.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.850
Hi.
- Hello.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.886
- I didn't know
when I'd hear from you.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.487
I mean, I knew that
I would hear from you.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.790
I just wasn't sure.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.324
How did it go?

12:04.357 --> 12:07.160
- Um...
[sighs]

12:07.194 --> 12:10.030
I haven't told Coco,
not yet.

[soft piano music]

12:11.799 --> 12:13.200
- Oh, okay.
- God, that was intense.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.968
- Shh, she's on with Adena.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.805
- Why? What's happening?
- I don't know.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.807
- I know I have to end things.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.242
I should've ended them
before we, um...

12:22.275 --> 12:24.111

12:24.144 --> 12:26.980
It's not easy, Kat.
Coco and I...

12:27.014 --> 12:28.916
- Yeah, I--

12:28.949 --> 12:31.118
I mean, I--I can't
really imagine.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.187
- I just needed
to hear your voice.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.324
It reminds me
why I'm doing this.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.926
For us.

Hi, sorry.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.837
- Is everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.138
Yeah, totally.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.974
- Kat, I need to know that I--

12:54.007 --> 12:56.576
I'm not the only one
who's feeling something.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.046
I need to talk this out
in person.

Can I see you tonight?
- Yeah, sure.

Uh, I think I--

I think I get off
at around, like, uh...

Oh--oh, my God.
I'm sorry, Adena, I gotta go.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.862
- Did you just tweet that up
from the "Scarlet" account?

13:14.895 --> 13:16.964
- Yes, because you guys were--
- I--sorry.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.899
- All right, it's down.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.868

It's all fine.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.553
Uh, Jacqueline is apparently
the only one in the world

13:40.587 --> 13:42.555
who saw my mildly
homophobic tweet.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.859
- Was she mad?
- She was, um, concerned.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.428
She said she's worried
I'm having personal issues.

13:48.461 --> 13:52.365
- Totally not going through
anything life-altering.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.935
- Uh, oh, I, uh, signed you
both up for Soul Wheel.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.570
Don't fight it.
It's happening.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.940
- I have never seen her this
strung up by anybody before.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.975
- I know, are we excited
for her or nervous?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.977
- A little bit of both.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.378
Soul Wheel?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.547
- Hard no.
- Yeah.

14:07.580 --> 14:14.421

14:15.388 --> 14:17.991

I saw that TED Talk.

What's up?
- Oh, um...

14:20.027 --> 14:22.462
I came by to see
if there was any room

14:22.495 --> 14:24.597
to negotiate your offer?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.934
While I know that
being your assistant

14:26.967 --> 14:28.601
is an incredible opportunity,

14:28.635 --> 14:32.339
I feel like I bring something
really special to the table.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.541
I have three years of experience
on "Scarlet's" busiest desk.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.409
- And one of the most heinous.
- [chuckles]

14:36.443 --> 14:38.345
- You should've led with that.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.347
- Right, so you can understand
where I'm coming from.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.949
Look, I know how to contact

14:41.982 --> 14:44.017
the entire editorial staff
on the weekends.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.086
I'm so good at expense reports,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.421
I'll have "Scarlet" paying for
your sister's birthday gifts,

14:48.455 --> 14:51.424
and I'll have your travel
upgraded every single time.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.494
- I already fly first,
and my sister and I don't speak.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.499
- Okay.
Uh...

14:59.532 --> 15:01.434
Um, maybe I'm not doing this
the right way--

15:01.468 --> 15:03.470
- Sutton,
I'm sure you understand

15:03.503 --> 15:06.173
that every penny I pour
into my assistant's salary

15:06.206 --> 15:08.041
is a penny less I have
to spend on the image,

15:08.075 --> 15:09.542
which is what sells
this magazine.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.411
- I understand.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.046
- Then you'll understand
I have to consider my options.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.581
- Absolutely.
- I'll think it over,

15:14.614 --> 15:17.184
and I'll let you know.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.451
- Thank you.

can I help you?

15:35.535 --> 15:36.369

- Yeah.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.038
- I hope you don't mind.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.472
I thought I would start
familiarizing myself

15:39.506 --> 15:41.741
with the phone system,
but it's beyond basic.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.012

an appointment or something?

15:45.045 --> 15:46.379

you'd show me the ropes.

and Lauren loves her.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.762
It's deeply irritating.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.531

- He says I'm worried
over nothing,

16:08.101 --> 16:10.137
that journalists get sued
for defamation all the time.

I could be a stripper?

- They make really good money.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.511

aren't big enough.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.713
- Damn it.
That's discrimination.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.249
- So sue me.
- I'll get in line.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.017
- Hm.
- [chuckles]

16:24.051 --> 16:25.652
Seriously, though,
I don't what I'm gonna do

16:25.685 --> 16:28.121
if Oliver says no.
- He says not gonna say no.

It's the office.

- Jane, hi.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.663
It's Richard Hunter.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.532
- Richard, hi, how are you?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.134
- We heard back from
Ms. Stanley's attorney.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.104
She's open to
a settlement conversation,

16:44.137 --> 16:45.538
which you will be
required to attend.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.440
- So we're talking settlement?

16:47.474 --> 16:50.243
Uh, is this because of my notes?

16:50.277 --> 16:53.446
- Well, without clear evidence,
that's just where we're at.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.515
Now, as the one
named in the suit,

16:55.548 --> 16:56.683
you'll need to appear
at the table,

16:56.716 --> 16:58.518
but you don't need
to say anything.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.553
Leave that to us.
- Look, I've been thinking

17:00.587 --> 17:02.289
through the conversation
that Morgyn and I had, and...

17:02.322 --> 17:04.691
- Jane, Josh Crenshaw here.
Look, we think we can

17:04.724 --> 17:06.493
get this thing
good and wrapped up tomorrow.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.228
She gets some money,
we get her to sign

17:08.261 --> 17:10.097
a non-disclosure agreement.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.831
All you have to do is show up,
not say a word,

17:11.864 --> 17:13.233
and everybody walks away happy.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.735
- Does that mean
I'm admitting guilt?

17:18.105 --> 17:20.673
- The best thing for Steinem,
for "Scarlet," and for you,

17:20.707 --> 17:23.476
is to put this behind us
as quickly as possible.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.212
Now, get some rest,
and I'll come by

17:25.245 --> 17:26.479
and walk you through it
tomorrow before the meeting.

Good night.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.854
- No.
They wanna settle.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.256
My notes weren't good enough.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.091
- Is that what Richard said?

17:38.125 --> 17:40.193
- Well, he didn't have to
spell it out.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.862
I had a clear conversation
with Morgyn--I know I did.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.331
I never agreed
to hide her identity.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.698
- Okay, so maybe it's just
easier to settle.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.600
- Easier for who?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.502
It makes me look like
I don't know how to do my job.

I'm so happy that you're here,

than I thought.

together?

not all of them good.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.817
- Yeah, but not all of them bad.

- No.

But maybe we should just...

18:42.955 --> 18:45.358
not talk about it?

they bought art,

19:56.929 --> 19:58.898
they went to Iceland,

an unconventional lifestyle

28:41.921 --> 28:44.223
with a husband and wife
and their live-in guru,

28:44.256 --> 28:46.058
that could be cute.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.327
- Who knows, maybe I'll move
to Queens with you.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.864
That way I'll never
run into Adena ever.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.933
- I can't believe
how quickly that imploded.

28:53.966 --> 28:58.004
- We just wanted
different things, you know?

28:58.037 --> 28:59.138
It's fine.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.073
What's worse is that

29:01.107 --> 29:03.009
the host for that Soul Wheel
event just cancelled,

29:03.042 --> 29:05.912
so now I have to hype up
all the fitness freaks.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.314
- You're gonna be great at that.
- Mm.

29:08.347 --> 29:11.784
Uh, babe? You're mad at Oliver,
not the shoe.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.986
- I'm not mad at Oliver,
I'm mad at myself.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.388
I'm mad that I can't
get this scuff out.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.025
I'm mad that I can't
keep these shoes.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.029
Look at this bow.
- Aww, honey. [chuckles]

29:23.062 --> 29:25.965
Hey, look, if Oliver
won't budge on salary,

29:25.998 --> 29:27.900
maybe there's something else
you can ask for,

29:27.934 --> 29:29.936
like perks.
- Mm, like, what,

29:29.969 --> 29:31.904
more time off, so I can take
vacations I can't afford?

29:31.938 --> 29:33.973
- No. No, you...
[door opens]

29:34.006 --> 29:36.342
You have to figure out
what else is important to you.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.912
- [groans]
You guys...

29:40.947 --> 29:43.816
Morgyn Stanley
is taking me to court.

29:43.850 --> 29:44.917
- Oof.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.085
- And now Jacqueline
is mad at me.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.387
This day sucks.
- Hey...

29:48.420 --> 29:51.023
join the party.

29:51.057 --> 29:54.160
- Queens? Don't be dramatic.
You're not moving to Queens.

29:54.193 --> 29:57.463
Is this all the wine?
- I'm not being dramatic.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.032
Oliver is exploring
other options,

30:00.066 --> 30:02.468
and Taylor has my old job.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.905
- You know what, you just need
to go Nora Ephron on his ass.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.908
- And what?
Write a hit Meg Ryan Film?

30:08.941 --> 30:10.476
- Uh, no.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.913
Look, when Nora started
at "Newsweek" in the 60s,

30:13.946 --> 30:15.948
they refused to give her
due credit,

30:15.982 --> 30:17.449
so she just marched in there

30:17.483 --> 30:19.085
and demanded that
they give it to her.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.988
- And they didn't, and she left.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.255
- That's not the point.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.992
The point is,
she kept the power.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.960
She was willing to walk away.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.495
Trust me, you wanna be
the person at the table

30:29.528 --> 30:32.231
with the power, 'cause being
the other person blows.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.967
- You know what, Jane's right.
You gotta go in there,

30:35.001 --> 30:37.436
tell Oliver that you are
willing to walk away.

30:37.469 --> 30:40.239
- Mm-hm.
- And go where?

30:40.272 --> 30:42.341
Nora Ephron had
two really successful parents

30:42.374 --> 30:44.877
and was raised
in Beverley Hills.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.445
She could say no.
She had a safety net.

30:46.478 --> 30:49.248
I don't.
- Okay, calm down.

30:49.281 --> 30:52.018
- [chuckles] Don't be like that.
We're trying to help you.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.986
- Oh, you have a great record
for helping people these days,

30:54.020 --> 30:55.387
don't you?
- What does that mean?

30:55.421 --> 30:57.089
- Did you know that
when you outed Morgyn,

30:57.123 --> 30:58.324
her son got kicked
out of private school?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.326
- What?
- Oh, wow.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.994
- What are you talking about--
a son?

31:02.028 --> 31:03.395
I didn't even know
that she had kids.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.331
- Oh, maybe your research
wasn't as thorough

31:05.364 --> 31:07.166
as you thought it was.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.068
[solemn music]

31:09.101 --> 31:11.137
- Why is Richard telling
you this and not me?

31:11.170 --> 31:13.005
- That's so not the point.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.941
The point is, you think
you're not judgmental, Jane,

31:14.974 --> 31:16.342
but you are.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.044
- Where are you going?

31:18.077 --> 31:19.411
- I can't be here
with you right now.

You guys aren't listening
to anything I'm saying.

Okay, good.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.169
That is a relief.

31:44.336 --> 31:47.173
Richard...

31:47.206 --> 31:49.141
never mind.
- What?

31:49.175 --> 31:50.977
- I didn't know she had a kid.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.444
- Sutton shouldn't have
told you that.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.214
Look, we really need you
to keep your emotions in check

31:55.247 --> 31:57.349
for this next meeting.
- How?

31:57.383 --> 32:00.186
I feel terrible.
- Which is why you have a lawyer

32:00.219 --> 32:03.055
to take all the emotion
out of the situation.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.291
- Yeah.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.593
Look, I know this is awkward,

32:07.626 --> 32:10.129
but can you just talk to me
not as my lawyer

32:10.162 --> 32:13.032
and just as the guy who's
secretly dating my roommate

32:13.065 --> 32:15.067
and whatever that
makes you to me.

32:17.003 --> 32:19.038
Do you think it's my fault

32:19.071 --> 32:21.073
that her kid
got kicked out?

32:22.474 --> 32:24.443
- [sighs]

32:24.476 --> 32:26.245
I think it's the school's fault.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.214
It's a bullshit reason
to kick a kid out of school,

32:28.247 --> 32:30.983
but since she doesn't have
any legal recourse there,

32:31.017 --> 32:33.986
I think she's looking for
a place to direct her anger,

32:34.020 --> 32:36.088
and it's unfortunate
that it's at you,

32:36.122 --> 32:38.290
because you're not the one
who's unfairly judging her.

32:38.324 --> 32:41.293
- But...I did.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.463
I unfairly judged her without
getting the whole story.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.034
- I shouldn't have talked
about this with Sutton.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.069
I'm sorry.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.239
- I was hard on her too.

32:53.272 --> 32:56.208
- Well, I think we just have
a few things to go over,

32:56.242 --> 32:59.378
and you can get out of here
and get back to work.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.328
um, we feel bad.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.230
- I feel terrible.

33:18.264 --> 33:22.034
You said some things
that were right

33:22.068 --> 33:24.103
and, honestly, deserved.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.404
- Thank you.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.239
- But you were wrong
about one thing.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.241
You said Nora Ephron had
a safety net and that you don't,

33:29.275 --> 33:31.410
and that's just not true.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.279
- What are you talking about?

33:34.446 --> 33:38.650
- Okay, if Oliver won't
give you what you deserve,

33:38.684 --> 33:40.486
then you'll move in with me,

33:40.519 --> 33:43.155
rent-free, until you figure out
the next step.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.224

the same offer,

month to month,

you're willing to walk away.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.674
Morgyn should get the money,

38:28.707 --> 38:30.709
and I'll just go

38:30.742 --> 38:32.678
and write the next thing.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.613
Thank you, Richard.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.781
- Yeah, no problem.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.583
- Can you feel yourself growing?

38:37.616 --> 38:39.585
You are almost there.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.453
- I would need
guaranteed overtime

38:41.487 --> 38:44.122
and per diem when we travel.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.725
And a date
three months from now,

38:46.758 --> 38:48.360
where we can review
my performance

38:48.394 --> 38:51.497
and adjust my pay accordingly,
because I know

38:51.530 --> 38:53.832
I'm gonna be
indispensable to you.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.701
I feel these are
reasonable requests

38:55.734 --> 38:57.903
that will little to no effect
on your bottom line.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.071
And if you can't meet me
on most of them,

39:00.105 --> 39:02.774
then, respectfully,

39:02.808 --> 39:05.377
Oliver...

39:05.411 --> 39:07.879
I'm gonna have to pass.

39:07.913 --> 39:11.650
- Five seconds before
we release the resistance.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.085
Three, two, one.

39:14.119 --> 39:17.088
Now release the torque.

39:17.122 --> 39:18.757
It doesn't matter
what you start.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.660
What matters is
how you choose to finish.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.129
- * I just wanna be
somebody to someone *

39:24.162 --> 39:26.665
- [sobbing]

39:26.698 --> 39:29.668
- You can do this.
You can do anything.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.604
*

39:32.638 --> 39:35.474
This is your ride.
This is your life.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.676
- * And if the sun starts to set
and the sky goes cold *

39:37.709 --> 39:40.879
* And if the clouds get heavy
and start to fall *

39:40.912 --> 39:43.949
* I really need somebody
to call my own *

39:43.982 --> 39:46.818
* I wanna be
somebody to someone *

39:46.852 --> 39:48.720
* Someone to you

39:48.754 --> 39:49.888
* Ooh

39:49.921 --> 39:51.790
* Someone to you

39:51.823 --> 39:53.725
* Ooh

39:53.759 --> 39:55.160
* Someone to you

39:55.193 --> 39:56.862
* Ooh

39:56.895 --> 40:02.200
* Someone to you
someone to you *

40:02.233 --> 40:08.840
*

40:08.874 --> 40:10.576
- How'd it go?

40:14.846 --> 40:16.548
- I'm Nora Ephron, bitch.

40:16.582 --> 40:17.716
- [screams, laughs]

40:17.749 --> 40:19.651
*

40:19.685 --> 40:21.853
I knew it, I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it...

40:21.887 --> 40:24.456
*

40:24.490 --> 40:27.459
[knocking on door]

40:27.493 --> 40:31.597
*

40:31.630 --> 40:32.731
- Who is it?

40:32.764 --> 40:33.965
- It's me.

40:33.999 --> 40:37.202
*

40:37.235 --> 40:38.737
Look, you were right.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.873
I was a mess of a coward.
I was.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.542
And I'm sorry.

40:43.575 --> 40:46.177
I'm so sorry.
That was horrible.

40:46.211 --> 40:48.547
- Go on.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.716
- It's not that
it's a gay relationship.

40:50.749 --> 40:53.785
It's really not.
It's that it's any relationship.

40:53.819 --> 40:54.986
*

40:55.020 --> 40:57.022
I've never been in one before,

40:57.055 --> 40:59.658
and I can't promise
that I won't mess it up,

40:59.691 --> 41:02.528
but...

41:02.561 --> 41:04.763
I'm totally in.

41:04.796 --> 41:11.770
*

41:11.803 --> 41:13.905
- I'm...

41:13.939 --> 41:16.775
I booked a flight to Paris.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.911
Coco and I are going to
try to work things out.

41:22.013 --> 41:23.749
I leave tonight.
