26:57.826 --> 27:00.954
To change our destiny.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.416
(GRUNTS)

27:05.167 --> 27:09.963
YODA: <i>Meanwhile, on the </i>Millennium Falcon,
<i>hungry and bored Chewbacca's family was.</i>

27:11.006 --> 27:13.759
-(GRUNTING)
-(SCREAMING)

27:14.968 --> 27:16.803
Uh, what's with the smiles?

27:16.887 --> 27:18.931
Enjoying the biggest
intergalactic disaster

27:19.014 --> 27:21.225
since Jar Jar Binks' senate speech?

27:21.308 --> 27:22.601
Nope. That.

27:23.185 --> 27:24.394
(TRILLS)

27:24.770 --> 27:26.772
-You can set up over there, Max.
-(TRILLS)

27:26.855 --> 27:28.941
Um, what is Max Rebo doin' here?

27:29.024 --> 27:30.859
No one's listened to him
in, like, 30 years.

27:30.943 --> 27:32.528
We hired him to kick this party up.

27:32.611 --> 27:37.199
And isn't it the Max Rebo Seven?
I mean, where're the other, ya' know, six?

27:37.282 --> 27:38.575
(TRILLING)

27:38.659 --> 27:39.993
Oh.

27:40.077 --> 27:41.119
My condolences.

27:41.203 --> 27:44.665
Guys, this is a nice thought,
but no one listens to...

27:44.748 --> 27:49.336
Max Rebo?
Now this is a Life Day party! (LAUGHS)

27:49.628 --> 27:51.547
Where's my boyfriend?

27:51.630 --> 27:52.881
-(ROARING)
-(LAUGHING)

27:52.965 --> 27:54.383
There he is!

27:54.466 --> 27:55.843
(LAUGHING)

27:55.926 --> 27:57.135
What is going on?

27:57.219 --> 28:00.556
Life Day is about being with friends
and family, right?

28:00.639 --> 28:03.225
So, we figured the more the merrier!

28:03.308 --> 28:04.601
JAWA: (SPEAKING JAWANESE) <i>Utinni!</i>

28:04.685 --> 28:06.436
(SPEAKING RODIAN) <i>Maclunkey!</i>

28:06.520 --> 28:08.939
(IN ENGLISH) Off-world Jawa. Nice.

28:09.022 --> 28:12.860
And when you decided to invite
an entire star system for dinner,

28:12.943 --> 28:14.486
did you have a plan to feed them all?

28:14.570 --> 28:16.572
-Of course, we did.
-(R2-D2 BEEPING)

28:16.655 --> 28:22.035
Oh, Zorii! I knew you'd be back,
with a bunch of tip-yip.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.829
Straight to the galley with those, Zorii.

28:24.246 --> 28:26.748
Please be a cape, please be a cape.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.917
It's a wrap!

28:30.127 --> 28:32.713
This is one of my favorites.
Hope it's one of yours.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.131
(MUSIC PLAYING)

28:35.883 --> 28:41.096
(SINGING IN HUTTESE)

28:44.558 --> 28:47.311
(IN ENGLISH) In the original Huttese.
Cool.

28:47.394 --> 28:52.232
(BOTH SINGING IN HUTTESE)

28:57.154 --> 28:58.155
(CRYING)

28:58.238 --> 28:59.239
(IN ENGLISH) Joy.

28:59.907 --> 29:04.203
Nice, right? Second Death Star!
We built two o' these bad boys!

29:04.286 --> 29:08.040
I know! And that's how we got
the idea for Starkiller Base!

29:08.123 --> 29:11.793
Ooh! "Starkiller"! (CHUCKLING)

29:11.877 --> 29:13.086
Good name!

29:13.170 --> 29:14.171
DARTH VADER: Hey!

29:14.254 --> 29:16.256
Oh. You.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.633
Forgot you're still here.

29:17.716 --> 29:20.010
Skywalker is down
on the Forest Moon of Endor.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.386
Go. Fetch.

29:22.721 --> 29:23.972
Fine!

29:26.600 --> 29:31.021
Nice, right? Spins in both directions.
Ooh! Whoo!

29:31.104 --> 29:33.023
Uh, not to point out the obvious,

29:33.106 --> 29:36.777
but sending Vader down to the Forest Moon
above Endor to get Skywalker

29:36.860 --> 29:40.072
sets off the exact chain of events
that ends with Vader

29:40.155 --> 29:43.116
picking you up and chucking
you down a reactor shaft.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.702
And there's no coming back from that.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.371
Yeah, so?

29:47.454 --> 29:50.415
So, aren't you worried
about your apprentice betraying you?

29:51.166 --> 29:55.295
Ah, you mean my former apprentice?

29:57.089 --> 29:58.423
REY: Way to go, Rey.

29:58.507 --> 30:01.134
If you'd just listened to your friends
and stayed on the <i>Falcon,</i>

30:01.218 --> 30:02.636
none of this would have happened.

30:03.136 --> 30:08.183
But instead, you ignored them and...
And now you're talking to yourself.

30:08.267 --> 30:11.478
YODA: Upset, young Rey was. And alone.

30:12.104 --> 30:13.480
And hearing things.

30:13.564 --> 30:14.815
YODA: You are not.

30:16.942 --> 30:19.778
Master Yoda? I... I don't believe it!

30:19.862 --> 30:23.782
With all you've seen today,
so impossible to believe, is it? Hmm?

30:23.866 --> 30:27.369
Master Yoda. I failed completely.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.745
So sure, are you?

30:28.829 --> 30:31.665
Failed to teach Finn.
Failed to stop Darth Vader.

30:31.748 --> 30:34.585
Failed to find a way out of here.
Pretty sure, yeah.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.086
All teachers fail.

30:36.170 --> 30:38.672
Saw my failure with Luke
on Dagobah, you did.

30:38.755 --> 30:41.300
-That's different.
-No, no different.

30:41.383 --> 30:43.635
From failure we can learn.

30:43.719 --> 30:46.263
Learn to be a better student
or better teacher.

30:47.222 --> 30:48.265
(SIGHS)

30:48.348 --> 30:51.810
Come. Let me show you
what you failed to see.

30:53.020 --> 30:54.396
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

30:59.818 --> 31:01.028
REY: I'm home?

31:01.111 --> 31:03.906
No. Here, but not here, you are. To learn.

31:03.989 --> 31:04.990
POE: Look out!

31:05.073 --> 31:08.160
-(PORGS GIBBERING)
-(FINN EXCLAIMS)

31:10.996 --> 31:12.748
Whoa! Where'd you learn that?

31:12.831 --> 31:15.042
Rey taught me to be
mindful of my surroundings.

31:15.125 --> 31:16.126
Rey's a good teacher.

31:16.210 --> 31:17.211
The best.

31:18.045 --> 31:19.421
Wise, Finn is.

31:19.505 --> 31:21.924
No. Wrong, Finn is.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.383
I don't understand.

31:23.467 --> 31:27.554
I've pored over the Jedi texts.
Memorized all there is to know.

31:27.638 --> 31:30.349
Dedicated myself
to passing on that knowledge.

31:31.517 --> 31:33.852
Are you sure I'm ready to become a Jedi?

31:34.770 --> 31:36.063
Hand me the lightsaber.

31:36.772 --> 31:38.190
(SIGHS) Guess not.

31:38.273 --> 31:42.194
Oh, no. Instead of helping Finn,
I hurt his feelings.

31:42.277 --> 31:46.406
So focused on the books you were,
the most important thing you forgot.

31:47.199 --> 31:50.452
Knowledge and training, a Jedi needs. Yes.

31:50.536 --> 31:54.206
But useless these are, without connection.

31:55.916 --> 31:57.084
What do you see?

31:57.876 --> 32:00.212
Jedi Masters and their students.

32:00.754 --> 32:03.215
Students, yes. But also...

32:03.632 --> 32:05.259
Friends.

32:06.468 --> 32:09.596
Hmm. Understand now, you do?

32:09.680 --> 32:12.182
A happy Life Day, I wish you, young Rey.

32:13.392 --> 32:15.519
Happy Life Day, Master Yoda.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.982
Oh, wait! How do we get out of here?

32:20.065 --> 32:22.359
What about Vader? And the Emperor?

32:22.442 --> 32:24.820
Showed you all you need to know, I did.

32:24.903 --> 32:27.614
(CHUCKLES) The power all along, you had.

32:28.866 --> 32:31.118
-Whoa!
-(GASPS) Oh.

32:31.201 --> 32:32.786
I didn't mean to scare you.

32:32.870 --> 32:34.663
Did you find that key you're lookin' for?

32:35.622 --> 32:37.040
-No.
-Oh.

32:37.124 --> 32:39.293
I thought maybe that was
what the green guy meant

32:39.376 --> 32:42.045
when he said,
"You had the power all along."

32:42.129 --> 32:43.422
You saw that?

32:43.505 --> 32:45.215
At least, I think that's what he said.

32:45.757 --> 32:46.967
It was kinda all backwards-y.

32:47.551 --> 32:49.595
"Had the power all along."

32:49.678 --> 32:51.305
Luke! Thank you.

32:51.388 --> 32:53.348
-For what?
-For teaching me something.

33:00.772 --> 33:02.399

33:18.457 --> 33:22.544
YODA: <i>In connection, strength we find.</i>

33:23.545 --> 33:27.174
<i>And happen, great things can.</i>

33:34.139 --> 33:36.600
-You did it!
-No, we did it!

33:36.683 --> 33:38.602
-Come on!
-Where are we going?

33:38.685 --> 33:39.937
To set things right.

33:46.109 --> 33:49.071
So, do you understand the plan?

33:49.154 --> 33:50.864
KYLO: Whee!

33:50.948 --> 33:54.535
Oh! Both ways!

33:54.618 --> 33:55.786
The plan. Do you...

33:57.871 --> 33:59.414
Do you understand it?

33:59.498 --> 34:01.208
When Vader returns with Skywalker,

34:01.291 --> 34:04.211
I grab them and I chuck them
both in the reactor.

34:04.294 --> 34:06.713
That's right! (SCOFFS)
See how they like it.

34:06.797 --> 34:11.009
Then you and I rule
the galaxy for all eternity.

34:11.093 --> 34:16.974
The Emperor and his faithful
second-in-command, the Supreme Leader.

34:17.057 --> 34:19.351
(SIGHS) Master, I'm unsure.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.812
Oh, no, no, no. As you can see,

34:21.895 --> 34:25.148
"Emperor" is clearly
above "Supreme Leader."

34:26.233 --> 34:28.944
Speaking of which, scoochy scooch!

34:29.695 --> 34:32.489
No, I'm good with throwing
my Uncle Luke down a reactor.

34:32.573 --> 34:34.449
But Grandpa Vader too?

34:34.533 --> 34:37.202
Hey, don't get cold feet on me now, kid.

34:41.373 --> 34:42.666
What is that?

34:46.336 --> 34:47.337
Ben?

34:47.421 --> 34:48.797
Ben? Who's Ben?

34:48.881 --> 34:52.301
That's "Supreme Leader Kylo Ren" to you!

34:52.384 --> 34:54.428
Check out this place!

34:54.511 --> 34:57.514
You! You're gonna pay
for what you did to me!

34:57.598 --> 34:58.849
What I did to him?

34:58.932 --> 35:00.559
I... I don't even know who he is.

35:00.642 --> 35:03.812
Less talky-talky, more fighty-fighty!

to show up, destroy him too.

I am not alone.

39:25.532 --> 39:27.451
DARTH VADER: I'm coming, my Master.

39:29.369 --> 39:32.789
Luke? Do you remember
the first Jedi lesson you ever learned?

39:33.832 --> 39:35.292
-Let...
-Go!

39:36.376 --> 39:37.669
(LAUGHING)

39:37.753 --> 39:39.046
What? (GRUNTING)

39:39.129 --> 39:41.465
Get off of me, you oaf!

39:43.342 --> 39:45.719
-Are you all right?
-I've been worse.

39:46.762 --> 39:48.013
Give me a hand, BB-8.

39:51.725 --> 39:53.018
LUKE: Where are you going?

39:53.101 --> 39:54.895
To put "you" back where you belong.

39:54.978 --> 39:57.439
Well, not "you" you. This you.

39:57.523 --> 39:59.191
Don't you want to see what happens?

39:59.274 --> 40:01.401
DARTH VADER: I'm sorry.
EMPEROR: One simple screw up!

40:01.485 --> 40:03.403
-DARTH VADER: Just move!
-Can't you do anything right?

40:03.487 --> 40:04.613
I already know.

40:05.322 --> 40:06.657
May the Force be with you.

40:08.534 --> 40:09.743
Nice kid.

40:09.826 --> 40:11.286
Oh, perfect.

40:11.370 --> 40:12.788
Now they're getting away.

40:12.871 --> 40:14.331
And it's all your...

40:14.414 --> 40:16.500
Huh? Hey! Put me down!

40:17.251 --> 40:20.462
DARTH VADER: I'm done
taking orders from you.

40:24.466 --> 40:27.594
Hey, what's with the sweater? (SCREAMING)

40:27.678 --> 40:30.138
Happy Life Day!

40:34.268 --> 40:37.563
"Galaxy's Best Emperor." (SCOFFS)

40:38.522 --> 40:40.899
Huh. This is actually pretty thoughtful.

40:41.525 --> 40:42.818
Why was I so mean about it?

40:42.901 --> 40:46.154
In fact, why am I always so mean?

40:46.238 --> 40:47.364
(GASPS)

40:48.115 --> 40:50.617
It's a Life Day miracle!

40:50.701 --> 40:51.702
Oh, that's it.

40:51.785 --> 40:54.329
That's it! From now on, no more dark side!

40:54.413 --> 40:56.707
No more ruling the galaxy!

40:56.790 --> 41:01.378
Ol' Sheevy Palpatine
is gonna change his way. (SCREAMING)

41:06.925 --> 41:09.970
(BEEPING)

41:10.053 --> 41:12.514
He'll be fine. He's one tough Jedi.

41:14.183 --> 41:15.350
He just doesn't know it yet.

41:16.518 --> 41:18.854
Come on. There's still
one more thing we need to fix.

41:18.937 --> 41:20.063
(BEEPS)

41:42.753 --> 41:44.463
(BEEPS)

41:52.888 --> 41:54.890
(MUSIC PLAYING)

41:57.768 --> 41:59.978
(ALL CHEERING)

42:07.861 --> 42:09.988
Who's hungry?

42:10.113 --> 42:11.406
(ALL CHEERING)

42:11.490 --> 42:12.533
FINN: Me! Me! Me!

42:13.242 --> 42:15.327
Mmm! Do I smell tip-yip?

42:15.744 --> 42:16.995
-Rey!
-(ROARS)

42:17.079 --> 42:18.330
Look at all this!

42:18.914 --> 42:20.624
Glad we made it back in time!

42:20.707 --> 42:22.125
-So are we.
-(ROARS)

42:22.209 --> 42:25.587
C-3PO: Oh, my!
That must've been quite an adventure.

42:26.463 --> 42:29.299
-How many Master Skywalkers?
-(BB-8 BEEPS)

42:29.383 --> 42:30.592
That sounds quite impossible.

42:30.676 --> 42:32.970
Did you find what you were
lookin' for at the temple?

42:33.053 --> 42:36.598
Turns out what
I was looking for was right here.

42:37.224 --> 42:38.350
-ROSE: Aw!
-(POE WHIMPERING)

42:38.433 --> 42:41.061
Oh, all right, you two, enough hugging.

42:41.144 --> 42:42.688
Come on. Let's eat.

42:42.771 --> 42:44.314
Are you crying again?

42:44.398 --> 42:46.275
No, pollen!

42:48.443 --> 42:51.780
Care to do the honors, Jedi Party Master?

42:52.281 --> 42:53.574
I think Finn should do it.

42:54.116 --> 42:55.784
But you're going to need this.

42:56.493 --> 42:57.703
Whoa!

42:58.620 --> 43:00.914
So, I am ready to become a Jedi.

43:00.998 --> 43:03.208
And now, I'm ready to train you.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.128
(INHALES)

43:06.211 --> 43:08.589
Okay. Let go,

43:08.672 --> 43:11.592
let go, let go.

43:15.053 --> 43:16.054
Oh.

43:16.597 --> 43:18.599
-(POE CRYING)
-Oh, Finn!

43:19.308 --> 43:20.976
We'll work on that. Together.

43:23.896 --> 43:26.023
-C-3PO: Oh, my!
-No way.

43:26.106 --> 43:29.902
C-3PO: Snow on Kashyyyk.
Why, the odds of this happening are...

43:30.777 --> 43:33.322
Oh, where is everybody? Wait for me!

43:34.406 --> 43:36.366
Whoa! Whoo! (CHUCKLES)

43:36.450 --> 43:38.035
(ALL CHUCKLING)

43:39.786 --> 43:40.871
(BEEPING)

43:40.954 --> 43:43.165
Hey, careful,
that's not a snowball, that's BB-8!

43:44.374 --> 43:45.501
(ROARING)

43:46.335 --> 43:47.753
(GIBBERING)

43:50.088 --> 43:51.381
Whoo! (CHUCKLING)

43:51.465 --> 43:52.841
D-O: Whee! Whee!

43:56.929 --> 43:57.930
-Hey!
-Look out!

44:03.143 --> 44:04.520
YODA: <i>A time of joy.</i>

44:05.521 --> 44:06.813
<i>Of friendship.</i>

44:07.481 --> 44:08.649
<i>Of family.</i>

44:09.608 --> 44:12.778
<i>-All of this, Life Day is.</i>
-(BB-8 BEEPING)

44:12.861 --> 44:14.738
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

44:19.368 --> 44:22.162
And a happy one, I wish you.
