WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:08.442
Way to finish
the school year,
cheerleaders.

00:08.476 --> 00:11.445
We wiped the floor
with the competition.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.548
Not literally.
I don't do housework.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.285
It's called homework.
And I don't do it, either.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.556
Our trophy will have
its place of honor here.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.492
Front and center.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.062
Wow. I did better
than last year.

00:28.096 --> 00:31.299
I won the trophy
for winning
the most trophies.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.135
What are you doing?
You're gonna take up
all the space!

00:34.168 --> 00:37.105
It's not my fault
they made my
cello trophy life-sized.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.841
Don't worry, Lexi.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.477
We can make more room
by taking out some of
the lamer trophies.

00:43.511 --> 00:46.314
Here. Nobody
cares who won the

00:46.347 --> 00:47.648
giant meatball-making
contest.

00:50.484 --> 00:53.421
Okay, Lexi,
don't get upset.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.423
Remember your alternate
nostril breathing.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.490
(BREATHING RAPIDLY)

01:01.262 --> 01:04.298
Paisley, this time
next week,

01:04.331 --> 01:08.502
it'll be summer vacation
and you and I will be
in Australia,

01:08.536 --> 01:11.572
thousands of miles away
from the nearest Ant.

01:16.344 --> 01:19.513
Hey. What are you guys
doing in Australia?

01:19.547 --> 01:21.249
Are you here for
the A.N.T. Convention?

01:22.150 --> 01:23.384
A.N.T. Convention?

01:23.417 --> 01:26.554
Yeah, thousands of Ants
from around the world

01:26.587 --> 01:29.523
have gathered
at this hotel for seminars,

01:29.557 --> 01:32.426
demonstrations,
and to compete
in the Antlympics.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.495
Hey, guys.
Look who's here!

01:34.528 --> 01:35.663
Hey!

01:35.696 --> 01:37.598
Hey, Lexi.
It's Fletcher
from school.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.368

01:43.537 --> 01:45.539

 Doo, doo

01:45.573 --> 01:47.441

 we all bring

 clip your wings

* You got it
 You got it

 We got it

* You can dream it

02:04.592 --> 02:06.394
* You can be it

02:06.427 --> 02:08.295
* If you can feel it

02:08.329 --> 02:10.564
* You can believe it

02:29.617 --> 02:30.618
Whoo!

02:38.526 --> 02:40.394
I like bowtie pasta.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.162
When you spill it
on yourself,

02:42.196 --> 02:44.232
it just looks like
you're dressed fancy.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.770
FLETCHER: There's Chyna.

02:49.803 --> 02:53.274
This is the summer
she starts
seeing me as a man.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.376
Ow! My fingy!

02:56.644 --> 02:59.347
Well, at least
you can tell her
you cut yourself shaving.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.485
G'day, mates.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.488
Hmm.
It's a good day now.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.358
The name's Neville.
Tazmanian Neville.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.426
You probably know me
from my hit show

03:12.460 --> 03:15.396
on the Animal
Taunting Network.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.998
I love your show.
I watch it all the time.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.401
It's on right after
 Dancing with the Sharks.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.970
Well, we'd better
get going

03:23.003 --> 03:25.673
so we can see some more
interesting demonstrations.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.443
The British
etiquette prodigy
is about to show us

03:29.477 --> 03:31.745
how to properly sip tea
and look scandalized.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.617
Don't go yet.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.720
I'm about to introduce you
to some of my wild friends.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.489
Like Rory over here.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.727
Also this lizard.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.329
(HISSES)

03:48.362 --> 03:50.331
Which one of you
is man enough

03:50.364 --> 03:53.367
to say hello to this
razor-toothed beast?

03:55.669 --> 03:58.506
I'll do it. I'm man enough.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.479
Hey there, little fella.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.647
(SCREECHES)

04:06.680 --> 04:07.681

04:12.520 --> 04:14.355
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:18.791 --> 04:20.528
Stop handing me pamphlets!

04:20.560 --> 04:22.530
I'm not an Ant!

04:22.563 --> 04:25.599
Do I look like
I'm part of this bunch of
creepy, nerdy losers?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.471
Answer her!

04:30.504 --> 04:32.740
She asked you a question!

04:38.479 --> 04:42.416
Here. Some teeth
for the girl with
the beautiful smile.

04:44.485 --> 04:48.789
Wow, in our country,
we put our baby teeth
under our pillows.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.558
Well, they're
crocodile teeth.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.561
Just one of the many
vicious animals
I encountered

04:53.594 --> 04:55.496
on my outback trek.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.331
(GIGGLING)
What is that?

04:57.365 --> 04:58.399
Well, it's...

04:58.432 --> 05:00.334
It's a traditional
rite of passage

05:00.368 --> 05:02.403
during which
adolescent males undergo
a spiritual journey

05:02.436 --> 05:03.704
and live for a period of
up to six months

05:03.737 --> 05:05.473
in the deadly wilderness
of the outback.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.775
Crikey, Olive!
Let the cute boy talk.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.780
Oh, big deal.
So, he fights crocodiles.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.417
I've been in much
deadlier situations.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.353
I used the bathroom
after Angus on the plane.

05:21.121 --> 05:25.426
Is everything okay?
You seem troubled.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.861
I'm just tired of
everyone thinking
I'm a wimp.

05:27.895 --> 05:31.432
A label only sticks
if provided the glue.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.802
Ah, so you're saying
they see me that way
because I allow it?

05:34.835 --> 05:38.105
I don't know.
I just read it
in a fortune cookie.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.808
But I do know it
isn't easy for a boy
to become a man.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.377
What you need is
an outback trek.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.579
Yeah, that might
clear my head.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.715
I could use a walk out back.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.385
See you in six months.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.520
Six what now?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.829
CHYNA: Fletcher? Fletcher?

06:01.862 --> 06:05.466
Well, we checked.
He's not in the gift shop.

06:07.167 --> 06:08.702
Did you look
anywhere else?

06:10.938 --> 06:11.872
No.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.644
But we got you
this platypurse.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.681
You seek the one
called Fletcher?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.550
Yes! Have you seen him?

06:22.583 --> 06:25.486
He is many miles away,
deep in the outback.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.422
On a trek
to become a man.

06:28.456 --> 06:29.957
Fletcher will never
survive alone.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.726
He's like a baby.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.963
How's a baby
supposed to survive
in the outback?

06:35.996 --> 06:37.998
Well, I can think
of one way...

06:42.503 --> 06:44.472
That's not gonna happen!

06:44.505 --> 06:46.006
You have to rescue him
from the outback.

06:47.975 --> 06:51.579
What's the big deal?
So, Fletcher's lost
in a steakhouse.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.983
The Australian outback.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.552
A vast and remote expanse
known for its harsh climate,

06:58.586 --> 07:01.722
barren landscape,
and deadly wildlife.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.626
Just to be safe,
we should split up
and check both outbacks.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.696
You take the deadly one.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.568
We'll never find
Fletcher ourselves.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.703
We're gonna
need some help.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.608
Neville! Our friend,
Fletcher, is lost.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.510
Will you help us
find him in the outback?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.011
Of course, I will.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.979
(ALL CHEERING)

07:26.013 --> 07:28.015
I say we wait
at the salad bar.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.651
People always
come back for seconds.

07:35.055 --> 07:39.693
I can't wait to get out of
this Ant infested hotel
and go to the beach.

07:39.727 --> 07:43.063
It was nice of the hotel
to leave this free
surfboard in my room.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.001
This is just great!

07:48.035 --> 07:51.271
Half my Ants left
on some tour with
Tazmanian Neville.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.974
They're going to
miss competing
in the Antlympics!

07:54.007 --> 07:56.610
Who cares about some
stupid competition

07:56.644 --> 07:58.646
that pits the best
and brightest young people

07:58.679 --> 08:02.650
against each other
as they demonstrate
their exceptional talents?

08:02.683 --> 08:04.818
It's not like
it's a beauty pageant.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.055
So much for first prize...

08:08.088 --> 08:11.925
Fifty thousand dollars
to remodel your Ant Farm
into whatever you want,

08:11.959 --> 08:13.894
a state-of-the-art
computer lab,

08:13.927 --> 08:17.064
state-of-the-art art lab,
a state-of-the-lab lab lab.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.032
A lab-lab-lab-lab lab lab.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.571
Or, a beauty salon.

08:27.040 --> 08:30.678
Come on, Chyna,
it's time to
trim my cuticles.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.813
And Paisley's
not-quite-as-cuticles.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.287
A beauty salon
would be great,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.121
because I'm thinking of
getting a perm.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.894
Then let us enter.
Winning the
music competition

08:46.927 --> 08:48.829
would be
a cinch for me.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.599
And I'm a really
good artist.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.866
You don't know this
about me,

08:52.900 --> 08:56.003
but my work is on display
all over the Usa.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.906
You mean U.S.A.?

08:59.873 --> 09:03.310
I know how to spell Usa.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.113
One problem.
They know
you're not Ants.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.781
You made that
pretty clear

09:07.815 --> 09:09.583
when you called
everyone in this room,

09:09.617 --> 09:12.085
"A bunch of creepy,
nerdy losers!"

09:14.121 --> 09:17.157
Don't look at me.
I'm just quoting
this girl who hates you.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.732
I think I may know
a way we can compete.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.968
We're ready
for the Antlympics.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.002
(GIGGLING)

09:32.039 --> 09:33.073
I'm a boy.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.918
This is where
I left your friend.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.187
Okay. Do you know
which way
he went after you...

09:48.856 --> 09:50.658
I really wish
he'd stop doing that.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.593
Do you know
which way Fletcher went?

09:55.829 --> 09:56.830
(SNIFFING)

10:01.735 --> 10:06.974
Uh-huh! Here.
These must be
his tracks.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.609
I'm pretty sure
Fletcher has
more than three toes.

10:11.779 --> 10:15.182
Well, maybe two of them
got eaten by a moose.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.719
There are no moose
in the outback.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.220
They're native to the
Northern Hemisphere.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.056
And we're in the...

10:23.090 --> 10:25.192
SoutherRight.sphere.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.127
Shouldn't you
know this stuff?

10:27.160 --> 10:31.932
Well, yeah. I do.
If it's in the script.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.702
But you're in the Australian
A.N.T. Program.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.903
You're a prodigy.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.939
Yes. An acting prodigy.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.743
What? But you led us
to believe you knew how to
survive in the wilderness!

10:42.776 --> 10:47.147
Yes. As I said,
acting prodigy.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.418
I just play
Tazmanian Neville on TV.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.187
My real name is
Barry Feigenbaum.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.758
But Tazmanian Feigenbaum
didn't have quite
the same ring to it.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.228
Well, that would have been
a good thing to tell us

11:01.261 --> 11:04.464
before we followed
you into the middle of
a snake infested desert!

11:04.497 --> 11:05.933
There are snakes out here?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.773
Welcome, everyone.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.042
I'm Bruce Tepley, winner

11:15.075 --> 11:18.045
and sole survivor of
 Dancing With the Sharks.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.179
(HOLLOW KNOCKING)

11:20.380 --> 11:24.117
I'll be your celebrity judge
for this year's Antlympics.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.819
First up,
Art.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.760
Paisley, I'm going to
say to you what I say
to all the Ants

11:32.793 --> 11:35.228
before a big competition...

11:35.262 --> 11:37.030
Have you seen
my wallet? I...

11:38.298 --> 11:43.837
Each of you
will create an artistic
representation of my lunch.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.309
On your marks,
get set...

11:50.978 --> 11:52.212
Create!

11:52.245 --> 11:56.750
Go, Paisley!
I mean... Go, Herbert!

11:59.920 --> 12:00.988
(BUZZING)

12:07.560 --> 12:09.296
You've got to be
kidding me!

12:09.329 --> 12:10.798
That painting is...

12:12.265 --> 12:13.333
Amazing!

12:15.268 --> 12:16.569
It's out of this world

12:16.603 --> 12:19.339
like that spaceship
from that science
fiction show I watch.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.813
I'm a boy.

12:27.214 --> 12:30.517
You said your work
was on display
all over the Usa.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.520
It is. It's on my
grandparents' refrigerator.

12:33.553 --> 12:37.057
They drive all over
the Usa,
camping in their rv.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.292
You mean R.V.?

12:40.327 --> 12:42.329
I know how to spell rv.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.967
We're gonna die.
We're all gonna die.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.369
We're all gonna
starve to death and die.

12:50.838 --> 12:54.074
I'm the star of
a wilderness
survival show.

12:54.107 --> 12:58.979
If I die out here,
people will mock me
on the message boards.

12:59.012 --> 13:02.983
Just relax.
Someone will come
looking for us.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.217
It's Fletcher
I'm worried about.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.153
I have an idea.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.589
How about we play
the "Who should we
eat first?" game,

13:09.622 --> 13:11.992
and then
not make it a game?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.865
Don't worry,
we won't starve.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.933
We could hunt for
one of those
kookaburra birds

13:19.967 --> 13:21.268
with this boomerang
I made.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.302
Oh!

13:23.170 --> 13:26.206
Okay. Here goes.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.308
Wait, what if you miss?

13:28.341 --> 13:31.311
Don't worry. The angle
of the boomerang's
airfoil wings

13:31.344 --> 13:34.181
creates aerodynamic forces
that curve its trajectory,

13:34.214 --> 13:36.049
making it travel
in an elliptical path

13:36.083 --> 13:37.417
and return to its
point of origin.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.995
Or not.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.899
Okay, forget food.
The desert,
it gets cold at night.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.334
It does?
That's crazy.

13:57.304 --> 14:01.942
Maybe we can start
a fire by banging
these two rocks together.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.345
Oh!

14:07.280 --> 14:08.916
Those aren't rocks.
Those are emu eggs.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.920
What's an emu?
It just sounds funny.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.022
Eee-mooo.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.293
The emu is
a soft-feathered,
brown, flightless bird

14:20.327 --> 14:22.095
that, despite
its cuddly appearance,

14:22.129 --> 14:24.197
can tear the flesh off
a human when angered.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.300
A little bird can do that?

14:27.334 --> 14:30.403
Oh. they're not little.
They're about this tall.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.471
(GULPS NERVOUSLY)

14:32.405 --> 14:33.406
(SQUAWKS)

14:35.675 --> 14:37.344
(CHUCKLES)

14:37.377 --> 14:42.382
This isn't emu yolk.
This is hair gel.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.384
(GYes.S)

14:47.687 --> 14:48.956
Ooh!

14:49.957 --> 14:50.958
(GRUNTING)

14:51.491 --> 14:52.492
(SCREAMS)

15:00.233 --> 15:01.334
(EMUS SQUAWKING)

15:03.470 --> 15:05.338
This is all
Fletcher's fault.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.341
We wouldn't be out here
if it weren't for him.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.110
He wouldn't be
out here
if it weren't for us.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.313
He obviously wanted
to prove he's tough

15:13.346 --> 15:15.115
because we tease him
all the time.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.050
I tease him
because I love him.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.685
You don't tease me.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.053
I know.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.355
What?

15:22.389 --> 15:25.358
I can't believe
we may never see
Fletcher again.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.460
I remember
the first time
I met him.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.396
Welcome to the place.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.365
Oh, look, that kid's
carrying something.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.500
That's Fletcher.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.002
Yadda yadda blabbedy blah.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.269
Dynamite.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.472
Is that how
normal people
remember things?

15:40.507 --> 15:42.309
I remember it perfectly.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.445
It was a Monday.
58 degrees,
Partly cloudy.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.480
I woke up at 6:42.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.383
I brushed my teeth,
starting on the lower
right quadrant...

15:50.417 --> 15:52.986
I just decided who
we should eat first.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.459
* To me

16:07.100 --> 16:09.402
Wow, that nerd can sing.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.138
We still have a chance.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.073
Yeah, we may have
lost at art.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.476
But we won at robotics,
science, and cooking.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.446
Plus I won this ice
from the slot machine
in the hallway.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.449
(VOCALIZING)

16:30.523 --> 16:31.524
(ALL CHEERING)

16:33.460 --> 16:37.330
Thank you to
the contestant
from the Usa.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.468
Sorry.
That's the U.S.A.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.337
What do you have to do
to get some bloomin'
punctuation around here?

16:45.438 --> 16:48.808
Lexi, you're
a really good singer.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.444
How come you're never
the lead in the school play?

16:51.478 --> 16:55.382
And now,
singing and playing
the wobble board,

16:55.415 --> 16:58.585
please welcome
the contestant
from Australia!

17:01.354 --> 17:02.522
She's the last contestant.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.826
And there's absolutely
no way on earth

17:06.858 --> 17:11.263
that this one person
could possibly be
a better singer than you!

17:12.199 --> 17:13.366
* Down under, we wonder

17:13.400 --> 17:14.467
* From sun down to dawn

17:14.501 --> 17:17.436
* Why wallabies run circles
 around in the lawn

17:17.470 --> 17:20.207
* Wallaby, wallaby, wallabaloo

17:20.240 --> 17:24.344
* Try not to step in
 kangaroo poo *

17:24.377 --> 17:25.645
(VOCALIZES OFF-KEY)

17:28.481 --> 17:29.482
(ALL CHEERING)

17:30.583 --> 17:32.119
She's terrible.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.221
That speech you made
before she sang
made me nervous.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.522
Why did you
say it like that?

17:35.555 --> 17:38.625
I have absolutely
no idea.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.461
There is no way on earth

17:41.494 --> 17:45.632
I will ever do
something like that again!

17:47.667 --> 17:50.237
Well, now that we've heard
the musical performances,

17:50.270 --> 17:53.606
I think it's obvious
who deserves to win.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.543
The team from Australia!

17:59.346 --> 18:01.348
You've got to be
kidding me!

18:01.381 --> 18:04.251
You just picked her
because you wanted
your own country to win.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.120
Put a sock in it,
Yankee-doodle-dork!
The Aussie team wins.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.188
Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!

18:08.221 --> 18:10.223
ALL: Oi, oi, oi!

18:10.257 --> 18:12.259
Even the Yiddish team
is rooting for them!

18:14.294 --> 18:17.530
I've been parading around
dressed as a nerdy Ant
all day for nothing?

18:19.932 --> 18:20.800
(YELLS)

18:20.833 --> 18:24.271
You're not an Ant.
You're disqualified.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.406
You forfeit
the second place prize.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.543
A $49,000
Ant Farm makeover.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.314
So, no beauty salon?
So much for my perm.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.549
Now, I'll always have
straight chest hair.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.153
I'm a boy.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.294
Thank goodness
the emus finally left.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.296
We can go back to
looking for Fletcher.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.231
What we need to
look for is some water.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.666
This plant I got
at the gift shop
is doing really badly.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.570
Hey, look,
there's a watering hole.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.605
(GASPS)

18:59.339 --> 19:00.640
(SQUAWKING)

19:00.673 --> 19:02.609
But it's surrounded
by those mu-mus.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.615
Yes, but look
what I found.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.351
Feathers.
They're everywhere.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.687
Hey, good idea.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.324
We'll tickle them
until they give up
the water.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.228
Or we can do something
that makes sense.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.599

This is it.
We're doomed.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.826
And the worst part is,
we never saved
poor, helpless Fletcher.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.729
Yee-haw!

20:33.766 --> 20:35.402
Fletcher?

20:35.435 --> 20:38.271
Step back.
These emus require
a delicate touch.

I'm so glad you're okay.

I'm fine. I found
some food and water.

But I bet you guys
have probably been
eating like kings

with Tazmanian Neville
taking care of you.

(LAUGHING) This guy?

21:18.077 --> 21:21.481
The only hunting and
gathering he's ever done
is in a gifting suite.

Hey! Don't laugh.
Those things are brutal.

Nicole Kidman
to get that necklace.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.823
Well, maybe you need
an outback trek.

21:30.857 --> 21:34.293
It's done wonders for me.
It made me realize
I'm stronger than I thought.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.897
Yeah. Way stronger.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.768

realized it before,

it'd work.

how to tame a flock of

I'd like to bring out
a very special guest.

as I was facing the perils
of the merciless outback,

22:33.820 --> 22:38.357

poor, helpless
nine-year-old boy.

What? That's not
what happened.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.164

because of your crazy accent.

You look adorable
in that getup, boy.

Maybe someday
you'll grow up,
fight a croc,

22:58.845 --> 23:01.781

just like this one.
