WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:02.434
I'm getting sick and tired
of being shot at

00:02.503 --> 00:04.596
by your dumb, stupid
little toy cannon.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.503
As a matter of fact,
I never want to hear
it again.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.563
Ever!

00:09.377 --> 00:11.902
Magnum, how the heck
are you?

00:14.648 --> 00:15.637
A friend of yours?

00:15.750 --> 00:17.980
He's a commando, Higgins.
We knew him in Nam.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.212
Tyler Peabody McKinney.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.309
What are you here for, Tyler?

00:20.521 --> 00:23.183
You remember that execution
I was talking about?

00:23.257 --> 00:24.588
Well, it wasn't just mine.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.024
<i>It was</i>
<i>J.J. Quincannon's, too.</i>

00:27.094 --> 00:29.654
<i>I managed to skate it,</i>
<i>but they still got J.J.</i>

00:29.730 --> 00:31.391
Who's "they"?
- The Viets.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.454
And that's why I'm here.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.058
I want you guys
to come back with me
and get him out.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.534
For you gentlemen
are asking me and my crew

00:38.739 --> 00:41.435
to risk our lives
on a dangerous journey

00:41.942 --> 00:44.911
into a remote part
of the country,
where there is no law.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.909
I'm fine. Just fine.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.911
What's wrong with him?

00:49.984 --> 00:51.952
He was wondering
if it was pre-ordained

00:52.019 --> 00:54.749
that we were supposed
to die in Southeast Asia.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.482
We've been set up.
They want the guns.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.572
Any ideas?

05:44.378 --> 05:45.470
Nope.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.603
Me either.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.593
Higgins!

06:05.899 --> 06:07.526
That just missed me!

06:34.695 --> 06:36.492
Death to the papists!

06:55.215 --> 06:57.342
Reach for the sky,
Wellington,

06:59.019 --> 07:02.318
because you and the entire
British Army are history.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.188
I most certainly
am not history,

07:06.260 --> 07:07.887
and it is
General Wellington.

07:07.995 --> 07:12.125
Furthermore, this deviation
from the battle plan is
a travesty of history.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.390
You, Magnum,
as the frog General Lejeune,

07:14.468 --> 07:16.333
were supposed to attack
from the right flank,

07:16.403 --> 07:19.497
not cravenly sneak up
behind me, the noble Duke.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.470
But then, Duke,
I wouldn't have been
able to capture you.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.238
That is
precisely the point.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.802
Why even attempt to recreate
the Battle of Salamanca,

07:26.880 --> 07:30.247
if you and your revisionist
friends refuse to play
by the rules?

07:30.317 --> 07:32.376
Good question.
It's not
a rhetorical one.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.784
If I am to prove
my theory

07:33.854 --> 07:35.845
that General Lejeune
was culpable
for the French defeat

07:35.923 --> 07:39.450
at the monthly meeting
of the Anglo-Franco-Hawaiian
War Society, I have...

07:39.526 --> 07:41.619
Come on, guys, war's over.
Let's go celebrate.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.356
Magnum. Magnum, wait!

07:43.430 --> 07:45.796
No. We quit.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.492
You can't.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.162
Why not?
If we can't play to win,
we won't play.

07:50.404 --> 07:53.840
Magnum, I beg you
to think of the consequence
of this rash action.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.334
We just did.

07:55.409 --> 07:56.569
Yeah.

07:56.643 --> 08:00.841
Besides, I don't know why
we let you con us into playing
this dumb game anyway.

08:00.914 --> 08:01.972
Con?

08:02.416 --> 08:03.405
Con?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.880
As I recall, Rick,
the reason you are here,

08:05.953 --> 08:09.013
indeed the reason you are
all here playing
this dumb game,

08:09.089 --> 08:12.149
and will be here tonight
for an after-dinner board
version of same,

08:12.226 --> 08:13.784
is because if you were not,

08:13.861 --> 08:16.295
you would at this very moment
be explaining to
the club directors

08:16.363 --> 08:18.558
a highly questionable
expenditure

08:18.632 --> 08:21.362
to an establishment known as
Edie's House of Ecstasy.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.503
Your job, Rick,
and your club privileges
would be,

08:24.571 --> 08:27.165
as you so quaintly
put it, history.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.201
Higgins, that's not fair.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.370
Fair? Magnum,
war is not fair.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.071
But that's not
the point, is it?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.739
That...
Stripper.

08:35.816 --> 08:36.804
Was for T.C.'s birthday.

08:36.884 --> 08:37.976
On club premises.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.313
After hours.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.115
And besides,
she wasn't a stripper,
she was...

08:41.188 --> 08:42.746
Irrelevant.
No, she was more of...

08:42.823 --> 08:44.051
Highly irrelevant.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.955
Well, so is
your Battle of Salamander.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.118
Salamanca.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.354
Irrelevant!

08:48.428 --> 08:52.228
The point is, Higgins,
you can blackmail us
into being your toy soldiers,

08:52.299 --> 08:54.790
you can blackmail
us into playing
your dumb board games,

08:54.868 --> 08:57.200
but we draw the line
at indiscriminate slaughter.

08:57.271 --> 08:59.831
I mean, you're not even
giving us the slightest
chance of winning.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.171
Of course not.
That would be
historically inaccurate.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.676
Well, historically inaccurate
or not,

09:04.745 --> 09:06.906
I'm getting sick and tired
of being shot at

09:06.980 --> 09:09.073
by your dumb, stupid
little toy cannon.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.980
As a matter of fact,
I never want to hear
it again.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.040
Ever!

09:20.594 --> 09:22.528
Bang, bang, Magnum.

09:24.998 --> 09:25.987
Guys.

09:30.003 --> 09:30.992
Tyler.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.237
Tyler McKinney.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.371
Magnum,
how the hell are you?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.179
Sorry I asked.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.216
Give me a hand.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.388
Where you been, Tyler?

09:56.663 --> 09:58.028
Been to an execution.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.689
Anybody we know?

10:00.000 --> 10:00.989
Mine.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.732
Well, I guess somebody
messed up, then.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.230
I've been missing
you all, too.

10:07.874 --> 10:08.863
Got anything to drink?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.135
Certainly not.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.209
And I demand
an explanation.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.907
Okay, General,
just don't slug me, too.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.882
Go ahead, Higgins.
Belt him if you want.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.513
How did you get
on this estate?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.483
Very nearly in my sleep.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.218
He's a commando, Higgins.
We knew him in Nam.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.591
All true.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.664
And I apologize
for shooting off
your cannon, sir.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.590
But considering the target,

10:33.667 --> 10:35.658
it was sort of irresistible.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.730
Quite.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.838
Tyler Peabody McKinney.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.635
Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.043
Pleased to meet you.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.882
Now, how
about that drink?

10:52.285 --> 10:55.220
Chateau Marquand, 1961.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.854
A truly spectacular year.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.415
Damn straight.
Spent it in the Congo.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.524
So did I.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.923
Is that so?
Who were you with?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.866
I was attached to
the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.334
No kidding.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.197
Maybe you was
the limey that shot me.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.203
Perhaps.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.608
Whoever it was,
too bad his aim wasn't
a little bit straighter.

11:20.814 --> 11:24.306
If it was,
maybe Cam Ly never
would've happened.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.111
Is that it?

11:26.253 --> 11:27.550
Is that what's
eating you guys?

11:27.621 --> 11:29.612
You're still holding
Cam Ly over my head?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.885
No. What are you
here for, Tyler?

11:32.759 --> 11:35.319
If you just blew
into town to share
a couple of glasses of wine

11:35.395 --> 11:37.488
and some old war stories,
I'd just as soon pass.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.758
You coming, guys?

11:38.899 --> 11:39.888
Yeah.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.724
Magnum, we're not finished
with our business.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.894
Maybe you aren't,
Higgins. I am.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.266
Hold it. Whoa!

11:45.005 --> 11:47.940
I got one-eighth
of my brain shot
off at Cam Ly.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.532
My freaking brain.

11:49.776 --> 11:52.108
We're talking six grams
of epoxy in there.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.374
I overheard the medic
pronouncing me dead.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.906
Yeah, I remember Cam Ly,

11:59.252 --> 12:00.514
and I'm sorry.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.454
So's Eddie Miller.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.949
What are you
here for, Tyler?

12:10.964 --> 12:13.831
You remember that execution
I was talking about?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.564
Well, it wasn't just mine.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.995
It was
J.J. Quincannon's, too.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.136
I managed to skate it,

12:22.576 --> 12:23.941
but they still got J.J.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.611
Who's "they"?

12:27.881 --> 12:29.007
The Viets.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.513
Got him in a hole in Cambodia.
Place called Chong Ker.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.477
And that's why I'm here.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.281
I want you guys
to come back with me
and get him out.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.696
What do you say, guys?

12:45.198 --> 12:46.187
I need you.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.501
This is the most goony thing
I've ever heard.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.006
We could get killed.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.512
You could get killed
getting out of a bathtub.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.413
But not shot.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.281
Sort of depends on
who's bathtub
he's getting out of.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.589
That's exactly the kind
of logic that's always
gotten you into trouble.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.257
I ain't saying
this isn't trouble.
It's for J.J.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.766
Nevertheless, Cambodia is
a foreign and hostile country,

13:20.833 --> 13:23.700
at this moment occupied
by the Vietnamese Army.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.430
That's not the point, Higgins.

13:25.504 --> 13:29.031
The point is, our business
there is long since over.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.936
It's as much history
as your Battle of Salamander.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.104
Salamanca.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.579
You know what I mean.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.945
It doesn't matter.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.311
It's not history
to an Air Force captain
named Lloyd Woodley.

13:40.386 --> 13:43.082
He's been MIA since 1971.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.180
Me and J.J. Heard
through some friendlies inside

13:45.257 --> 13:46.781
that he was being held
at a hamlet

13:46.859 --> 13:49.851
near the juncture
of the Cambodian,
Laotian, Thai borders.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.787
And you and J.J. Just
cakewalked right on in there.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.492
That's right.
Only we was set up.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.904
Instead of Woodley,
we was met by a martinet major
and a firing squad.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.240
Why then have you come
to Magnum and his friends

14:04.310 --> 14:06.744
for what is ostensibly a...

14:06.812 --> 14:08.370
CIA operation?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.342
'Cause I ain't CIA.

14:10.483 --> 14:14.214
I'm just a guy
with a small airplane
charter in Southeast Asia.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.878
I still hear things
every now and then,

14:15.955 --> 14:17.980
and, yeah,
I like to keep my hand
in the game.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.547
I like the action.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.693
But more important,

14:22.528 --> 14:23.995
I guess

14:24.630 --> 14:26.655
I still give a damn.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.397
Come on, Magnum, tell me.
What have you been
doing with your time?

14:30.936 --> 14:32.631
Snooping keyholes?

14:32.705 --> 14:36.163
Making Hawaii safe
for the divorcées?
Having fun?

14:36.409 --> 14:39.469
I don't have to justify to you
what I do with my life.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.944
I ain't asking you to.

14:41.013 --> 14:44.039
All I know is,
whatever you're doing now,
it ain't the action.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.248
The action's over.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.649
The hell it is.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.513
And you guys.
Look at you.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.992
Still trying to hold
on to it,

14:54.093 --> 14:56.186
but you're not really
sure how.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.488
I mean,

14:58.631 --> 15:00.428
you're still
flying, ain't you?

15:01.967 --> 15:03.195
Tourists?

15:03.269 --> 15:04.861
Hey, that's my business.

15:05.071 --> 15:09.337
You're business used to be
being one of the best combat
pilots in Southeast Asia.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.868
Maybe the best.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.010
And you, Orville.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.343
Still wheeling
and dealing, ain't you?

15:19.518 --> 15:21.645
Still looking for the action.

15:22.621 --> 15:26.921
You used to find it
squeezing an M60
out the side door of a slick.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.390
And you was
the best guy I ever seen

15:32.465 --> 15:35.161
at going behind the lines
and coming back
with the scalps.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.431
You know,
you was all good.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.940
And that's
why I'm here.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.572
You was good,

15:46.378 --> 15:49.245
and now you're
sitting on your butts

15:49.348 --> 15:51.543
letting the action
pass you by.

15:52.251 --> 15:56.085
We're not letting
the action pass us by.
We're facing reality,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.184
putting those times to rest.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.386
Then what are you wearing
that SEAL cap and that MIA
bracelet on your wrist for?

16:06.365 --> 16:09.300
I just spent
two-and-a-half days
on an airplane. I'm tired.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.166
I don't have time
or the inclination to argue
with you guys.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.103
I'm not here
to rehash Cam Ly.

16:14.273 --> 16:17.606
I'm here now
about J.J. Quincannon.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.805
The same J.J. Quincannon

16:19.879 --> 16:22.814
who covered our rears
when we evacuated
Binh Loc, remember?

16:23.015 --> 16:26.610
And the same J.J. Quincannon
who came roaring in with
that squad of Montagnards.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.050
You remember
that one?

16:28.120 --> 16:30.281
When those crud ARVIN officers
were gonna blow us away,

16:30.356 --> 16:32.756
after we caught them
stealing that payroll?

16:33.058 --> 16:34.423
Yeah, him.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.619
And the same J.J. Quincannon

16:36.695 --> 16:39.095
who talked those Air Force
bozos out of homicide,

16:39.165 --> 16:43.499
when Orville here got us
into that little altercation
outside of a Saigon bar.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.102
J.J. Needs our help,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.833
and that's all
I'm gonna say about it.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.770
I'm through talking.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.412
Thanks for your hospitality.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.546
And if any of you
want to join me,

16:59.151 --> 17:01.813
be at hangar 12
at 0600,

17:02.922 --> 17:05.253
'cause I'm going
back for him.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.365
Well, good night,
gentlemen.

17:18.436 --> 17:19.869
Good night, Higgie.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.736
You know,
I still think it's goony.

17:24.108 --> 17:26.167
He's absolutely right,
you know.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.036
At this point in our...

17:28.581 --> 17:31.379
Your lives,
an adventure like this is

17:31.517 --> 17:33.075
patently absurd,
isn't it?

17:35.221 --> 17:36.984
Well, then, good night.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.751
Magnum, lock up,
will you?

17:38.858 --> 17:39.916
Right.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.059
Lunch at the Club?

17:44.296 --> 17:47.026
Oh, no.
No, I can't tomorrow.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.391
I have a meeting
with my accountant,

17:49.468 --> 17:52.835
and we have to talk over
some tax shelters that he...

17:53.672 --> 17:56.300
Yeah, maybe I can go,
if I'm back

17:56.375 --> 17:58.343
from the Miss Pineapple
prelims in time.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.344
Right. I forgot.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.939
It's no big deal.
I gotta take my TV
into the shop anyway.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.449
I gotta wash the Ferrari.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.452
I'll just hook up
with you guys later.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.053
Yeah, later.

18:10.823 --> 18:11.812
Good night.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.243
Tyler.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.647
Morning, Magnum.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.348
Let's do it.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.111
How long?

19:18.190 --> 19:19.350
Two weeks.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.985
Two weeks from now,
you'll be sitting
on some barstool

19:22.061 --> 19:25.292
telling outrageous lies
to some beautiful blonde

19:25.364 --> 19:29.391
about T.S. Magnum's
great Cambodian raid.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.227
That gonna be
okay with you?

19:32.471 --> 19:34.905
Getting J.J. Home
is gonna be okay with me.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.168
You got it.

19:39.611 --> 19:42.739
Look, I know you're
not here 'cause of me.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.082
Doesn't make any difference.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.078
I appreciate it
just the same.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.482
What about Orville
and T. C?

19:54.560 --> 19:55.788
I don't know.

19:56.328 --> 19:57.625
You didn't talk to them?

20:00.933 --> 20:03.424
Hey, more action
left for us.

20:16.315 --> 20:17.646
Out of sight.

20:24.156 --> 20:28.422
Tower, this is November
one-six-two Echo, requesting
permission for take off.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.225
By the way, guys,
I fixed breakfast for you
up here.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.525
Check the galley.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.694
You knew we were coming?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.565
Either that, or he was
real hungry.

20:41.940 --> 20:45.535
This is November one-six-two
Echo, requesting permission
for take off.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.345
I got the assistant manager
covering

20:48.781 --> 20:51.409
the Miss Pineapple
prelims for me,

20:52.484 --> 20:54.247
and for the rest
of the month.

20:55.287 --> 20:56.777
How about you?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.186
Got this sign that says,
"Gone fishing."

21:00.826 --> 21:03.226
I told Higgins
I was going to Maui.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.131
<i>...altimeter one-seven-five,</i>

21:06.198 --> 21:08.098
<i>wind three-four-zero at 60.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:09.760
Roger.

21:10.402 --> 21:13.929
Fasten your seatbelts, guys.
We're on a slow boat
to Bangkok.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.272
Who's that?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.553
Maui, indeed.

21:30.756 --> 21:31.984
I'm sorry I'm late,

21:32.057 --> 21:34.924
but I had to make
arrangements with the staff
for the upkeep of the estate.

21:34.993 --> 21:36.051
If you'll lend me a hand...

21:36.128 --> 21:38.619
Higgins, what are you
doing here?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.994
Joining this expedition.
Now, if you'II...

21:41.066 --> 21:43.034
Whoa, whoa. Hold it.
You're just too, too...

21:43.102 --> 21:46.162
Too what? Too old?
Too sedentary? Rubbish.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.297
Now, wait a second.
That's not what I said.

21:48.373 --> 21:49.704
It's just that
it's not your battle.

21:49.775 --> 21:51.970
Nonsense.
I believe in your cause,

21:52.044 --> 21:55.810
and I believe that I can be
of invaluable assistance
in its successful execution.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.281
This guide you were talking
about picking up in Bangkok,

21:58.350 --> 22:00.147
for the trip up the river
and beyond?

22:00.219 --> 22:01.413
Well, that won't be
necessary now.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.318
You see, I was
with the French forces
in '53,

22:03.388 --> 22:05.413
and I'm quite familiar
with the entire region.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.391
Oh, come on,
Higgie baby, you couldn't...

22:07.459 --> 22:10.360
As a matter of fact,
I was the chief consultant
to Rand McNally

22:10.429 --> 22:12.420
when they updated the map.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.798
Now, shall we get cracking?

22:21.640 --> 22:22.800
Magnum?

23:00.179 --> 23:02.704
What are you guys
all droopy-jawed for?

23:02.781 --> 23:05.875
I mean, hell,
we're gonna kick some butt.

23:41.535 --> 23:43.435
This place bring back
memories, or what?

23:43.504 --> 23:44.493
Yep.

23:44.605 --> 23:46.539
I once had a week's
R and R here.

23:46.607 --> 23:48.939
Everybody's had
a week's R and R here.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.671
Where's Thomas and Higgins?

23:50.745 --> 23:53.441
They're in the cab behind us.
Don't worry, they'll be here.

23:56.250 --> 23:59.083
Do you realize, Magnum,
that in the last 30 years

23:59.153 --> 24:03.089
the price of a taxi has
jumped 312%%?

24:05.092 --> 24:08.550
Well, apparently everything
else has remained the same.

24:09.997 --> 24:12.192
But perhaps you wouldn't
realize that.

24:12.967 --> 24:14.332
No, I've been here.

24:15.202 --> 24:16.191
Here?

24:18.339 --> 24:20.239
It's like I just
stepped back in time.

24:21.676 --> 24:22.802
Quite.

24:23.110 --> 24:24.668
<i>Monsieur</i> Higgins.

24:27.281 --> 24:28.270
<i>Merci.</i>

24:29.950 --> 24:33.147
Just as in 1953,
the staff still speaks French.

24:33.354 --> 24:35.754
As I say,
some things never change.

24:36.590 --> 24:38.387
Indeed, the Hotel Royale
has been

24:38.459 --> 24:41.428
home to three generations
of soldiers in Southeast Asia.

24:42.396 --> 24:45.729
Come, Magnum.
After we freshen up,
I'll buy you a gin and tonic.

24:46.634 --> 24:50.502
I wonder if Pierre
still tends bar in
the Parisian Room?

24:52.940 --> 24:55.431
At least you'll
enjoy the orchestra.

24:55.976 --> 24:57.910
Tasteful and civilized.

25:49.029 --> 25:52.192
I don't wanna
get burned.
You understand?

25:52.466 --> 25:55.435
I have no wish to see
you on fire, Mr. Tyler.

25:55.503 --> 25:56.663
Good.

25:56.737 --> 25:59.001
Then you won't mind
if I pay you

25:59.073 --> 26:02.907
half when we shove off
and half when
we reach Ban Li upriver.

26:02.977 --> 26:04.410
That I do mind,

26:04.478 --> 26:07.606
for you gentlemen
are asking me and my crew

26:07.715 --> 26:10.775
to risk our lives
on a dangerous journey

26:10.985 --> 26:14.284
into a remote part
of the country,
where there is no law.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.653
Just Vietnamese,

26:17.024 --> 26:18.616
Khmer Rouge,

26:19.059 --> 26:21.994
and private armies
of the opium warlords.

26:22.630 --> 26:27.033
Besides,
I do not know of Ban Li.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.500
We do.

26:33.307 --> 26:36.299
Half now, half later.

26:41.615 --> 26:43.378
If you don't show up,

26:43.851 --> 26:45.216
I'll find you

26:46.120 --> 26:49.612
and I'll hurt you so bad
your ancestors
will scream for mercy.

26:54.028 --> 26:56.053
Half now.

27:14.782 --> 27:17.808
Meet me at Nang Rong Canal
at dawn.

27:18.419 --> 27:22.287
You and your tourist friends.

27:29.096 --> 27:30.324
We're on our way.

27:32.132 --> 27:34.464
Who's bankrolling you, Tyler?

27:34.602 --> 27:35.796
Me.

27:36.704 --> 27:38.137
And the CIA?

27:39.073 --> 27:42.702
Would they trust me
with guns and money?

27:43.244 --> 27:45.678
This whole operation
is mine, Magnum.

27:45.746 --> 27:47.270
Ours.

27:47.681 --> 27:50.650
I make pretty good money
flying people around
these parts.

27:50.951 --> 27:52.578
Sometimes I don't know who,

27:52.653 --> 27:55.520
and a lot of times
I don't know exactly where
until the last minute,

27:55.589 --> 27:57.614
just like
this riverboat captain.

27:57.691 --> 28:00.956
The point is,
I keep my mouth shut,
I don't ask questions,

28:01.161 --> 28:02.788
and I get paid pretty good.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.232
Right now, this operation,

28:05.299 --> 28:08.860
I want to start paying back
those jokers who set me
and J.J. Up.

28:09.203 --> 28:10.636
And I want to get him out,

28:11.305 --> 28:13.933
and the MIA Woodley,
if he's there.

28:14.909 --> 28:17.935
Listen, I don't think
you guys would really be here

28:18.012 --> 28:19.741
if you didn't
believe me, right?

28:21.415 --> 28:23.713
Maybe it's a little less
believing in you

28:23.784 --> 28:25.775
and a little more
believing in J.J.

28:27.721 --> 28:28.881
Whatever.

28:29.790 --> 28:31.121
We're gonna have a blast.

28:31.191 --> 28:33.489
No, we won't have a blast.

28:37.531 --> 28:39.226
See that man over there?

28:39.833 --> 28:41.596
He's been
a professional soldier
all his life.

28:41.669 --> 28:43.227
He doesn't know J.J.

28:43.304 --> 28:46.296
But he's probably known
a dozen others just like him,
and that's why he's here.

28:46.373 --> 28:48.238
He's not here
to have a blast.

28:48.742 --> 28:52.974
He's here because
he's getting older
and he's missing the action.

28:55.583 --> 28:57.551
And Rick and T.C. In there,

28:58.118 --> 29:00.882
half their lives have gone
by since they were doing this.

29:01.121 --> 29:03.385
They just want to diddy-bop
one more time.

29:03.457 --> 29:05.049
You gonna tell me
I'm lying?

29:06.427 --> 29:07.917
And you.

29:08.128 --> 29:10.494
You don't have
to be creeping up
on middle age

29:10.564 --> 29:12.054
to feel old, do you?

29:14.902 --> 29:18.394
I'll be at your guys' door
at 0500. Be ready.

29:19.039 --> 29:22.202
And don't get
too fugazi tonight,

29:22.409 --> 29:25.276
'cause tomorrow
it starts getting real.

29:39.059 --> 29:41.118
Hey, hey, hey.

29:46.133 --> 29:47.498
What did she say?

29:47.568 --> 29:48.557
She said that
from the right side

29:48.636 --> 29:50.194
you look exactly
like Dustin Hoffman.

29:51.772 --> 29:52.932
Are you sure?

29:53.007 --> 29:54.907
Of course I am.
I'm very fluent.

30:01.849 --> 30:04.818
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.315
Higgins, what did you
say to them?

30:08.422 --> 30:09.946
We were just about
to have some fun.

30:10.024 --> 30:12.492
You heard what she said.
She said I looked like
Dustin Hoffman.

30:12.993 --> 30:14.790
From the right side.

30:15.796 --> 30:18.663
Rick, we shove off at 5:00.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.858
In the morning?

30:20.934 --> 30:21.923
Mmm-hmm.

30:26.573 --> 30:28.131
Yeah. I'll be ready.

30:28.509 --> 30:29.498
Good show.

30:33.781 --> 30:35.612
I'm fine.

30:36.450 --> 30:37.678
Just fine.

30:49.096 --> 30:50.529
What's wrong with him?

30:58.639 --> 31:00.800
He was wondering
if it was pre-ordained

31:00.874 --> 31:03.672
that we were supposed
to die in Southeast Asia.

31:06.246 --> 31:09.113
Then the girls came
and kind of cheered him up.

31:11.518 --> 31:12.815
I don't know.

31:13.754 --> 31:15.779
Guess I'll go
help him to his room.

31:16.323 --> 31:18.052
See you guys in the morning.

31:20.461 --> 31:22.053
See you in the morning.

31:23.397 --> 31:24.659
Higgins, wait a minute.

31:24.932 --> 31:26.695
Well, shouldn't we turn in?

31:27.634 --> 31:30.000
What did that girl
really say to Rick?

31:33.040 --> 31:35.531
She said she was looking
in the eyes of a dead man.

32:06.540 --> 32:07.939
Tools of the trade.

32:09.343 --> 32:12.676
H and K MP5. That's what
we use nowadays.

32:13.013 --> 32:14.105
We?

32:14.348 --> 32:16.509
The generic we,
of course.

32:17.651 --> 32:20.245
Whole new generation
of assault weapons.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.118
We started testing them
when we got kicked out of Nam.

32:23.690 --> 32:24.679
Shame.

32:24.792 --> 32:25.986
Hardly.

32:26.293 --> 32:30.024
I'd be perfectly satisfied
with a good old reliable
Sten gun.

32:30.464 --> 32:33.433
It sometimes seems
that the only reason
we have wars

32:33.500 --> 32:36.060
is to develop
new weapons
for the next one.

32:37.104 --> 32:39.072
What else you got
in there?

32:39.173 --> 32:41.141
A whole candy store, T.C.

32:41.308 --> 32:42.741
Try a 91.

32:44.077 --> 32:46.011
You'll like
this one, Magnum.

32:46.413 --> 32:47.937
Eighteen-round.

32:48.816 --> 32:50.249
Armor-piercing.

32:51.919 --> 32:54.979
Israeli Galils.
Anything you want.
Take your pick.

32:55.622 --> 32:56.884
What about the chopper?

32:57.224 --> 32:59.920
Loach.
Meet us at Ban Li.

33:00.661 --> 33:03.494
Swoop in, then say bye-bye.
No sweat.

33:04.464 --> 33:06.591
Then why
World War III here?

33:09.236 --> 33:10.760
You never know.

34:07.361 --> 34:08.987
Boy, do I have a headache.

34:10.429 --> 34:11.556
Too much booze.

34:15.601 --> 34:17.934
You don't suppose
this guy makes bloody marys,
do you?

34:18.839 --> 34:20.136
I doubt it.

34:22.542 --> 34:24.737
Haven't seen you
hungover in a long time.

34:24.811 --> 34:28.042
You haven't seen me
get up at 5:00 in the morning
in a long time, either.

34:28.782 --> 34:30.340
But I'm okay.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.446
Sure?

34:34.721 --> 34:35.710
Sure, I'm sure.

34:39.293 --> 34:41.351
What are you looking at me
so strange like that for?

34:41.428 --> 34:42.621
I said I'm fine.

34:43.263 --> 34:44.321
Okay.

34:45.998 --> 34:47.431
What's the matter
with you?

34:48.302 --> 34:49.291
Nothing.

34:49.402 --> 34:50.391
I guess I was just

34:51.838 --> 34:53.601
thinking about J.J.

34:53.774 --> 34:56.368
We're all thinking
about J.J., Thomas.

34:59.813 --> 35:02.145
Maybe I was thinking
about Cam Ly, too.

35:06.553 --> 35:08.214
I'm trying not to.

35:22.769 --> 35:25.897
Motor dead.
We fix. One hour.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.294
Two hours.

35:49.363 --> 35:51.228
T.C., maybe you can
help them.

35:53.033 --> 35:54.364
Yeah.

35:55.068 --> 35:56.865
I knew I was here
for some reason.

36:09.683 --> 36:11.378
Oh, no.

36:12.552 --> 36:13.541
Son of a...

36:27.134 --> 36:28.328
Vietnamese?

36:28.435 --> 36:30.232
No, Thai bandits.

36:32.339 --> 36:33.931
We've been set up.
They want the guns.

36:34.007 --> 36:36.771
And that's just what
we're gonna give them!

36:39.246 --> 36:40.338
Break!

36:44.184 --> 36:45.879
Thomas, I got one!

37:14.147 --> 37:17.674
Keep capping.
Break right above
the water line.

37:57.222 --> 37:59.087
Relax, pilgrim.

38:01.260 --> 38:02.249
I relax.

38:11.537 --> 38:12.526
Suragit!

38:15.007 --> 38:16.440
McKinney!

38:16.542 --> 38:19.238
Hallelujah, boys.
I think we're gonna make it.

38:23.782 --> 38:25.943
Actually, I have
no doubt about it,

38:26.018 --> 38:27.508
or, I should say,
very little.

38:27.586 --> 38:30.282
Higgins, will you quit talking
and tell me what to do?

38:30.355 --> 38:32.152
I can't very well
stop talking and still
tell you what to do.

38:32.224 --> 38:33.213
Higgins, please.

38:33.325 --> 38:36.317
I remember the first time
I was forced to transfuse
blood in this manner.

38:36.395 --> 38:37.953
Korea, '51.

38:38.030 --> 38:40.965
Turkish chap had been
cut down from behind
by a sniper.

38:41.033 --> 38:43.501
We were pinned down
for two days in
a frozen rice paddy

38:43.569 --> 38:46.037
and I was well aware,
of course, that he would
succumb from blood loss,

38:46.104 --> 38:47.332
if I didn't do something.

38:47.473 --> 38:50.033
Fortunately, I saw
on his tag that we had
the same blood type,

38:50.108 --> 38:51.336
as I do with Rick,

38:51.410 --> 38:54.538
so I proceeded to sterilize
an immature stalk of bamboo.

38:54.980 --> 38:56.743
Needless to say...
- Higgins.

38:59.351 --> 39:00.841
All right, Magnum.

39:01.587 --> 39:03.248
Begin sucking
on the end of the reed

39:03.322 --> 39:05.688
as if you were siphoning
gasoline from an automobile,

39:06.058 --> 39:08.993
a procedure I'm sure
you've performed many times.

39:11.497 --> 39:13.397
Aren't you
in a lot of pain?

39:15.834 --> 39:17.631
Have you started the flow?

39:21.740 --> 39:22.729
Got it.

39:22.908 --> 39:23.897
Good.

39:25.010 --> 39:27.604
Now, prepare Rick's arm
for the other end.

39:38.690 --> 39:39.884
Just stick it in?

39:40.392 --> 39:42.417
In the big vein.

39:43.061 --> 39:44.050
Turn it just
a little bit.

39:45.130 --> 39:46.119
All right.

39:52.371 --> 39:53.963
Got it, I think.

39:54.706 --> 39:55.968
Good.

39:56.842 --> 39:58.776
Remove the reed
in four hours.

39:59.278 --> 40:01.303
That should allow
a sufficient amount.

40:02.014 --> 40:04.107
Then what do we do for him?
What about the bullet?

40:04.216 --> 40:06.184
As far as I can tell
after examining him,

40:06.251 --> 40:07.650
the bullet is fine
where it is.

40:07.719 --> 40:10.620
Doesn't appear to be near
any vital organs
or the lungs or spine.

40:11.089 --> 40:13.990
As I'm sure
you well know, Mr. McKinney,
the bullet was sterile,

40:14.059 --> 40:16.254
pristinely so,
when it left the rifle barrel,

40:16.461 --> 40:19.055
so it doesn't pose
any immediate danger
where it is.

40:19.631 --> 40:21.622
The only subsequent treatment
we can offer Rick,

40:21.700 --> 40:23.759
after stemming
the initial loss of blood,

40:23.835 --> 40:27.703
is to keep the wound
free of dirt to prevent
infection and fever,

40:28.206 --> 40:30.800
and do everything we can
to make him stronger.

40:31.877 --> 40:33.105
Rest and chicken soup.

40:33.579 --> 40:34.568
Precisely.

40:35.047 --> 40:37.982
Which my daughter,
Nata Ying, will gladly offer.

40:38.417 --> 40:39.406
Thank you.

40:39.484 --> 40:42.248
And thank you
for the hospitality
of your village.

40:42.754 --> 40:44.244
Welcome to Ban Li.

40:44.323 --> 40:46.689
May your mission
be a successful one.

40:47.359 --> 40:49.554
Did you want to see
the helicopter now?

40:49.928 --> 40:51.691
You got it, buddy.

41:01.907 --> 41:03.101
You gonna be okay?

41:03.642 --> 41:06.634
In a few hours
I'll be ready to join in
and do my part.

41:08.246 --> 41:09.975
I think you already have.

41:20.659 --> 41:22.957
Oh, yeah, about that guy
from Turkey...

41:23.996 --> 41:25.327
Corporal Ervacet.

41:25.964 --> 41:29.627
He was unfortunately killed
by the same sniper
two days later

41:29.701 --> 41:31.066
as we were
being evacuated.

41:35.173 --> 41:36.333
Pity.

41:47.019 --> 41:48.782
T. C: Where'd you find
this chopper?

41:48.854 --> 41:51.220
I didn't find it.
Our friends here did.

41:51.289 --> 41:53.154
They've kindly offered
to loan it to us.

41:53.225 --> 41:54.249
Where'd they get it?

41:54.426 --> 41:55.450
From us.

41:58.497 --> 41:59.896
Chopper.

42:03.068 --> 42:04.501
This thing must have
been here...

42:04.569 --> 42:06.161
Ten years, I'd say.

42:07.139 --> 42:08.800
Hey, listen,
I'm an airplane pilot.

42:08.874 --> 42:10.364
I don't know
a thing about slicks.

42:10.609 --> 42:12.474
If I could have
fixed it myself,
I would've done so.

42:12.544 --> 42:15.012
If I told you guys
it needed fixing,
you probably wouldn't be here.

42:15.514 --> 42:18.574
Well, that's just
real astute of you, Tyler.

42:19.951 --> 42:21.612
Nothing changes much,
does it?

42:21.687 --> 42:24.417
Except the truth
every now and then,
when it suits.

42:24.489 --> 42:25.547
I'm sorry.

42:25.624 --> 42:28.525
I just didn't want convincing
you guys any tougher on me
than it already was.

42:28.694 --> 42:31.629
Now, I say we go on
from here and do our job.

42:32.164 --> 42:33.290
Our job?

42:33.398 --> 42:37.858
Our job, Tyler, includes
checking and repacking
with grease every fitting,

42:37.936 --> 42:42.339
rebuilding the fuel pump,
getting the electrical system
started and working,

42:42.407 --> 42:46.776
checking every moving part
to see if it's either cracked
or dried out,

42:46.845 --> 42:50.042
and finding, God knows where,
some hydraulic fluid.

42:50.115 --> 42:51.980
And that's just for starters!

42:52.317 --> 42:54.717
Because if there's
any gas in that tank,

42:54.786 --> 42:56.515
it's gotta be purified.

42:56.588 --> 42:59.421
Well, hell,
why don't we just quit now
and go on home?

42:59.524 --> 43:02.015
Back to paradise.
Bye, bye, bye...

43:02.094 --> 43:03.356
No.

43:03.562 --> 43:05.359
We're not going back
to paradise.

43:05.530 --> 43:06.690
Not just yet,

43:06.832 --> 43:08.356
because Rick can't be moved.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.299
You want to sit around
and wait?

43:10.368 --> 43:11.767
No, we're not gonna wait.

43:11.837 --> 43:13.498
Higgins stays here with Rick.
T.C., too.

43:13.572 --> 43:16.507
He fixes this thing,
if he can.

43:16.908 --> 43:17.897
And you and me...

43:22.514 --> 43:24.141
We go after J.J.

43:24.683 --> 43:26.344
Out of sight.

43:42.067 --> 43:43.329
How much further?

43:43.635 --> 43:45.830
Another couple of clicks,
straight ahead.

43:46.338 --> 43:48.533
We go in,
we go out before breakfast.

43:48.874 --> 43:50.102
No hassle.

43:51.209 --> 43:53.939
You keep looking around.
You seeing something I'm not?

43:54.112 --> 43:55.704
I don't know.

43:56.481 --> 43:58.415
It's more like
I sense something.

44:00.452 --> 44:01.749
It's the action.

44:01.820 --> 44:03.549
I think
someone's behind us.

44:03.889 --> 44:05.880
Well, in that case,
I'm not worried a bit.

44:06.658 --> 44:08.819
Really hard times are
in front of us.

44:09.027 --> 44:12.360
The only ones behind us
are Suragit and your pals.
Let's go.

44:38.089 --> 44:41.217
All right, now, there's
a Vietnamese outpost

44:41.293 --> 44:43.386
about another click
straight ahead down the road.

44:44.863 --> 44:47.764
It's probably garrisoned
by no more than a squad.

44:48.366 --> 44:50.061
That's probably
where they got J.J.

44:52.170 --> 44:53.660
Let's go find out.

44:53.772 --> 44:54.761
Wait a sec.

44:56.241 --> 44:57.538
Before we do,

44:57.642 --> 45:00.668
there's just one other thing
we ought to take care of
while we're here.

45:01.780 --> 45:02.974
What?

45:05.984 --> 45:07.281
Magnum.

45:08.253 --> 45:09.242
Higgins!

45:15.660 --> 45:19.357
I'm glad I caught up
with you before
the excitement started.

45:20.799 --> 45:22.061
But even if I hadn't,

45:22.133 --> 45:24.931
I certainly would have
been useful as cover
for your retreat.

45:25.537 --> 45:26.629
Be that as it may...

45:26.705 --> 45:28.866
Be that as it may,
how the hell did you
catch up to us?

45:29.274 --> 45:31.174
Last time I saw you,
you were flat on your back

45:31.243 --> 45:32.574
with plants hanging
out of you.

45:32.811 --> 45:34.608
Rand McNally, remember?

45:35.313 --> 45:38.510
My shortcut eliminated
at least three hours
from the trek.

45:38.583 --> 45:39.641
If you had only consulted...

45:39.718 --> 45:40.946
Well, that's
just great, Higgins.

45:43.989 --> 45:45.456
Why are you here?

45:46.691 --> 45:48.352
I wasn't going
to get cheated.

45:53.665 --> 45:54.757
Yeah?

45:55.834 --> 45:58.997
Well, looks like
we're all gonna get cheated.

45:59.604 --> 46:01.162
Right here and now.
