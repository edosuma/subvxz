00:33.120 --> 00:35.160
I'm glad to see
everyone's on time...

00:35.160 --> 00:36.240
For once.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.400
You sound like
my homeroom teacher.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.040
Drago the dull.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.760
I like Mr. Drago.
He's funny.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.760
Step off.
The guy's stale.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.080
I think
he's pretty cool.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.400
You don't even
know him.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.880
Sure, I do.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.720
He comes into my father's
magic shop all the time.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.560
He's a prestidigitator.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.560
A what?

00:53.560 --> 00:54.560
That's
a magician.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.200
Really?

00:56.200 --> 00:58.960
Yeah. He calls himself
"the Amazing Drago."

00:58.960 --> 01:00.160
Get outta here.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.840
I'm serious.
He's been on TV.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.560
I've seen him.
He's pretty good.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.640
I guess you shouldn't
judge people.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.040
You never know when
they might surprise you.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.000
Exactly.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.800
And that's...

01:13.800 --> 01:15.840
What my story's
about tonight.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.320
Sometimes things
don't turn out

01:23.320 --> 01:25.920
exactly the way
you expect them to.

01:25.920 --> 01:29.000
People might not be
who they seem to be.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.720
And simple things...

01:31.720 --> 01:34.280
Could turn out to be
far more amazing

01:34.280 --> 01:37.360
than you could
ever imagine.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.480
Submitted
for the approval

01:43.480 --> 01:45.440
of the Midnight
Society.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.600
I call this story...

01:59.600 --> 02:02.520
<i> Todd marker
was having a tough time.</i>

02:02.520 --> 02:04.040
<i> His father
recently died,</i>

02:04.040 --> 02:06.600
<i> and his mother
worked all the time.</i>

02:06.600 --> 02:08.080
<i> To help make ends meet,</i>

02:08.080 --> 02:10.759
<i> Todd went to apply
for a part-time job</i>

02:10.759 --> 02:12.720
<i> he read about in the paper.</i>

02:12.720 --> 02:14.480
<i> It sounded like fun,</i>

02:14.480 --> 02:16.960
<i> but if he'd only known
what he was stepping into,</i>

02:16.960 --> 02:20.360
<i> Todd might never
had answered that ad.</i>

02:34.320 --> 02:37.720
[Sound of pigeon cooing]

02:46.040 --> 02:46.760
Hello?

03:19.520 --> 03:22.160
Man: Who are you?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.920
Um... I'm um...

03:24.920 --> 03:26.520
Todd Marker.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm answering the ad about
a magician's assistant.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.640
Uh, never mind.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.960
Leaving so soon?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
Mr. Shandu?

03:40.960 --> 03:43.440
Not "Mr." Shandu.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.520
Shandu the Magnificent!

03:49.040 --> 03:51.080
You may call me Shandu.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.800
Yes sir, Mr. Shandu.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.840
I mean--

03:53.840 --> 03:55.960
So, you want to be
my assistant?

03:55.960 --> 03:57.760
Well, yeah.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.760
Have you had
any experience?

03:59.760 --> 04:01.440
Sure.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.200
Who have you
worked for?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.520
Uh, Phil.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.120
Phil the fabulous.

04:09.720 --> 04:13.280
In other words,
you have no experience.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.920
Well, no.
But I'm a quick learner.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.399
Magic is not a
subject to be learned.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.519
It's a skill
to be acquired.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.760
You acquire it by
keeping your mouth shut

04:26.760 --> 04:28.920
and your eyes open.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.520
Does that mean
I have the job?

04:30.520 --> 04:31.920
Perhaps.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.080
We'll have to see
how you work.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.360
Aw, no sweat.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.720
I'm a hard worker.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.920
Good. You can start by
tidying up those props.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.400
Shandu: No! Not that.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.800
Never touch
another magician's wand.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.800
<i> That's a magic wand?</i>

04:53.800 --> 04:56.960
Yes. For thousands
of years

04:56.960 --> 04:59.440
deadeyed sorcerers
used wands like this

04:59.440 --> 05:01.480
to draw power
from the earth.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.160
Magical rule
number 1--

05:03.160 --> 05:07.040
<i>never ever touch
another magician's wand</i>

05:07.040 --> 05:09.680
unless he hands it
to you.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.080
Like this.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.120
Understand?

05:27.960 --> 05:31.360
<i> Todd's mother was an artist
at an ad agency.</i>

05:31.360 --> 05:32.880
<i> It was hard work,</i>

05:32.880 --> 05:34.880
<i> and she was always
getting stuck</i>

05:34.880 --> 05:37.400
<i> working late
at the office.</i>

05:37.400 --> 05:39.400
I know we need
the money,

05:39.400 --> 05:42.400
but I don't know if I
want to go back there.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.520
Sorry to make you
eat alone again, sweetie,

05:44.520 --> 05:46.400
but I've got to get
back to the office.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.480
I have to finish
those new storyboards.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.760
Did you hear what I said?
They guy's a boss from hell.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.600
I know the feeling.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.960
I wonder what dad
will tell me to do.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.560
He would have told you
to do your best

06:01.560 --> 06:04.400
and not run away
from a challenge.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.320
Try not to be too late.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.680
Love you.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.520
First of all, we'll get
the fingers warmed up.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.000
<i> In the following weeks,</i>

06:22.000 --> 06:24.520
<i> Todd and Shandu
rehearsed the act.</i>

06:24.520 --> 06:26.120
<i> Shandu made Todd nervous,</i>

06:26.120 --> 06:28.080
<i> and Todd made
plenty of mistakes.</i>

06:29.600 --> 06:31.480
Magical rule number 2--

06:31.480 --> 06:34.600
only let them see
what you want them to see.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.960
<i> Whenever Todd
messed up a trick,</i>

06:38.960 --> 06:41.680
<i> Shandu really
let him have it.</i>

06:46.440 --> 06:48.320
[Drops cylinder]

06:51.920 --> 06:53.680
<i> But the funny thing was,</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:55.560
<i> the more mistakes
Todd made</i>

06:55.560 --> 06:57.600
<i> the more determined
he became</i>

06:57.600 --> 06:59.920
<i> to prove himself
to the old magician.</i>

07:01.920 --> 07:04.120
All right.
The magic word--

07:04.120 --> 07:06.160
Shandu can do.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.800
No, no no!

07:08.800 --> 07:11.520
You're out of
position again.

07:11.520 --> 07:12.640
Sorry.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.320
Close it quickly.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.760
How many times
must we do this?

07:16.760 --> 07:18.200
I know, I know.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.720
Magical rule
number 3--

07:19.720 --> 07:21.400
the cardinal rule!

07:21.400 --> 07:25.800
<i>Never ever get caught
in your own reflection.</i>

07:25.800 --> 07:29.320
It's a precept of magic
as old as the thessalonians.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.400
You are hopeless.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.880
Can I say something?

07:38.880 --> 07:41.840
Only if it will
soothe me.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.880
Well, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

07:44.880 --> 07:47.800
but it's OK.
To lighten up sometimes.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.360
I beg your pardon?

07:49.360 --> 07:52.320
Well, you're always
in such a nasty mood.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.440
What's the problem?

07:56.720 --> 07:57.840
There was a time

07:57.840 --> 08:00.280
when I was
the toast of Broadway.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.840
I performed before
the crowned heads of Europe.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.360
I even had my own
movies series.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.160
Now what have I got?

08:07.160 --> 08:10.280
A few scrapbooks
of yellowed reviews.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.000
A few faded movie posters

08:12.000 --> 08:14.520
and this
broken-down truck.

08:14.520 --> 08:18.280
My movies
aren't even on video.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.080
It isn't very pleasant
being a has-been.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.000
You must excuse me

08:23.000 --> 08:28.760
if I don't always have the
sunniest of dispositions.

08:28.760 --> 08:33.799
This may be against
my better judgment, but...

08:33.799 --> 08:35.600
I've got something
for you.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.600
What is it?

08:38.600 --> 08:43.640
It's the tie that I wore
for my first performance.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.320
Don't make me regret it.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.800
<i> Then the day finally came</i>

08:55.800 --> 08:58.280
<i> when Shandu and Todd
were ready to face</i>

08:58.280 --> 09:00.800
<i> the most demanding
audience.</i>

09:00.800 --> 09:04.400
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for,

09:04.400 --> 09:06.080
the magical,

09:06.080 --> 09:07.240
the mystical,

09:07.240 --> 09:10.680
the Magnificent Shandu!

09:10.680 --> 09:13.040
[Kids cheering]

09:14.800 --> 09:17.960
Yay! Yay!
Yay!

09:19.800 --> 09:21.760
Whoa!

09:21.760 --> 09:24.880
Shandu: And now,
the magic words--

09:24.880 --> 09:27.480
Shandu can do!

09:29.000 --> 09:30.520
[Kids]
Whoa!

09:34.800 --> 09:37.760
I'm feeling
a little scattered lately.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.440
Do you think I should
pull myself together?

09:40.440 --> 09:41.840
Yeah! Yes!
Yay!

09:43.320 --> 09:44.760
Shandu:
Only this time,

09:44.760 --> 09:46.640
I'll need your help.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.240
You just shout
"Shandu can do" with me.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.680
When I count up to 3.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.000
1...

09:54.000 --> 09:55.760
2...

09:55.760 --> 09:56.280
3!

09:56.880 --> 09:59.880
Shandu can do!

10:02.840 --> 10:06.480
Whoa! Yay!
Yay!

10:08.840 --> 10:11.760
Yay! Yay!
Yay!

10:12.840 --> 10:14.000
Well?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.360
Well what?

10:16.840 --> 10:18.280
How'd I do?

10:18.280 --> 10:21.560
You want me to critique
your performance, do you?

10:21.560 --> 10:25.800
Well, you aren't the worst
assistant that I've ever had.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.840
I'll give you that.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.480
Shandu?

10:55.480 --> 10:56.880
Shandu?

11:01.360 --> 11:03.200
Come on, guys.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.040
Help me out.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.240
Shandu...

11:23.240 --> 11:24.880
can do!

11:24.880 --> 11:26.400
[Poof]

11:28.320 --> 11:30.000
Oh, man.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.520
[Quack quack]

11:33.320 --> 11:35.760
No wonder he didn't
want me to touch it.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.600
It's really magic.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.480
Anything happen
while I was away?

11:43.480 --> 11:45.840
Todd: No. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.760
Mom! Mom!

11:50.760 --> 11:53.280
You're not going to
believe what happened.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.320
I'll believe
anything right now.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.480
What's wrong?

11:56.480 --> 11:58.400
5 minutes
before I leave work

11:58.400 --> 12:01.280
I get a new project
dumped in my lap.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.520
40 storyboard frames.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.000
2 tomorrow.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.520
They're
killing you, Mom.

12:06.520 --> 12:07.880
Tell them no.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.200
Oh, I can't.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
Do me a favor,
sweetie.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.200
Wake me up in an hour.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.560
I gotta pull
another all-nighter.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.280
But I gotta
tell you about--

12:17.280 --> 12:19.760
Shh. Tell me later,
OK?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.720
Shandu?

12:52.720 --> 12:54.040
You back yet?

13:56.760 --> 13:58.760
Here goes nothing.

14:01.520 --> 14:04.000
Shandu can do!

14:04.000 --> 14:05.200
[Poof]

14:09.200 --> 14:10.320
Whoa.

14:18.720 --> 14:19.720
Whoa.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.840
Amazing.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.040
Who--
who are you?

14:38.040 --> 14:40.960
I'm Nazrak,
Spirit of the Wand.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.920
Unbelievable.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.800
I have a message
for you.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.800
A message?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.000
For me?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.480
Yes.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.960
What is it?

14:50.960 --> 14:52.520
The wand has
special powers

14:52.520 --> 14:54.520
that only you
can bring out.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.000
Use it anytime
you wish.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.320
But Shandu
said that--

14:58.320 --> 15:02.000
Anytime you wish.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.760
Anytime you wish.

15:10.320 --> 15:13.160
Very weird.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.320
What are you doing?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.040
I...

15:29.040 --> 15:30.760
I was...

15:30.760 --> 15:32.720
The wand. You took it.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.040
Did you use it?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.520
Well, yeah.
But Nazrak told me--

15:37.520 --> 15:39.640
Nazrak!
You saw it?

15:39.640 --> 15:40.920
Yeah.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.760
I knew
this would happen.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.760
After all these years

15:46.760 --> 15:49.320
to be released
by a mere boy.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.000
What are you
talking about?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.280
Nazrak is a demon.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.280
A powerful,
ancient magician

15:57.280 --> 15:59.160
who has been imprisoned
for centuries

15:59.160 --> 16:00.440
in the vortex.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.800
No. She was beautiful.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.280
Nazrak can take on
many forms, you fool.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.200
It wants this wand.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.880
To use it
is to summon its evil.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.680
I... I didn't know.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.800
If Nazrak is released,
it could mean the return

16:16.800 --> 16:19.440
to the dark ages
for all humanity.

16:19.440 --> 16:20.760
I...

16:20.760 --> 16:21.800
Get out.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.920
But--

16:22.920 --> 16:23.800
Get out.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.560
Shandu!

17:09.000 --> 17:11.440
[Coughing]

17:13.319 --> 17:14.319
Shandu?

17:15.319 --> 17:18.240
Man: Fire!
I'm trapped!

17:18.240 --> 17:20.520
Hel-l-l-p!

17:20.520 --> 17:21.599
Shandu can do!

17:23.319 --> 17:24.160
Shandu?

17:25.839 --> 17:27.240
Are you OK?

17:27.240 --> 17:29.080
I certainly am.

17:29.080 --> 17:33.320
I only needed you to use
the wand one more time.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.480
What?

17:34.480 --> 17:37.120
Magical rule
number 2--

17:37.120 --> 17:42.200
<i>only let them see
what you want them to see.</i>

17:42.200 --> 17:43.600
Hah hah hah!

17:43.600 --> 17:44.960
Nazrak.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.560
Heh heh.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.880
Shandu... can do!

17:49.880 --> 17:53.080
It will no longer
work for you.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.720
Where's Shandu?

17:54.720 --> 17:56.600
Silly old fool.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.840
He's taken my place
in the vortex.

18:00.840 --> 18:01.560
Now...

18:03.160 --> 18:06.800
give me the wand!

18:08.280 --> 18:10.040
Give me the wand.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
Mom?

18:24.280 --> 18:25.720
Mom?

18:25.720 --> 18:27.720
What?
What's the matter?

18:27.720 --> 18:29.720
Aw, man. You're not
gonna believe this.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.240
It's all my fault.
I didn't know!

18:31.240 --> 18:32.720
What have you done
to my tree?

18:32.720 --> 18:34.240
It's not a tree.
It's magic.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.240
It's evil.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.720
What magic?

18:36.720 --> 18:39.240
The same magic I used
on your storyboards.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.280
I didn't know
what I was doing when I...

18:44.320 --> 18:47.720
"I don't know how you did this,
but you're amazing.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.760
"I'm bringing them
to work right away.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.920
"We'll talk about it
when I get home.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.760
Don't wait up. Mom."

18:54.760 --> 18:57.320
[Thunder and lightning]

18:58.840 --> 19:03.160
[Sinister voice] Only let him
see what you want him to see!

19:03.160 --> 19:04.960
Hah hah hah!

19:04.960 --> 19:09.080
You silly boy.
Give me the wand!

19:18.320 --> 19:21.320
[Sinister voice]
You can't escape.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.200
Todd.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.200
Shandu?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.680
Is that you?

19:32.680 --> 19:36.080
Remember the rules
of magic, Todd.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.640
Use them!

19:41.760 --> 19:43.200
Shandu?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.720
[Sinister voice] The
old man can't help you!

19:45.720 --> 19:47.880
Give me the wand.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.600
I know the rules,
Nazrak.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.200
You can't take it
unless I hand it to you.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.720
I'm not gonna!

19:53.720 --> 19:57.960
I could force your
mother to convince you.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.120
Nazrak?

20:06.680 --> 20:08.280
I'll make a deal.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.680
I'll hand you
the wand.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.360
You have to leave
my mother alone.

20:15.360 --> 20:19.440
You hear me? That's
the deal, or no wand.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.280
Nazrak: Agreed.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.920
Give it to me.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.240
Ah. Great.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.680
Mine.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.680
I've waited centuries,

20:46.680 --> 20:50.040
and now it's mine.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.600
Remember our deal.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.440
Oh yes.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.160
Your mother's safe...

20:57.160 --> 20:59.200
but you're not!

20:59.200 --> 21:00.040
What?

21:00.040 --> 21:02.680
Magical rule number 1--

21:02.680 --> 21:06.440
never touch another
magician's magic wand

21:06.440 --> 21:09.000
unless he hands it to you.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.200
You never should have
handed it to me, boy.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.040
For now,
you're going to join

21:15.040 --> 21:19.200
the old man in the vortex!

21:19.200 --> 21:20.960
You can't do that.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.840
Oh, yes I can.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.880
Magical rule number 2--

21:25.880 --> 21:29.040
only let them see
what you want them to see.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.920
Be gone!

21:42.000 --> 21:44.560
Magical rule
number 3--

21:44.560 --> 21:46.000
the cardinal rule!

21:46.000 --> 21:49.120
<i>Never ever get caught
in your own reflection.</i>

21:49.120 --> 21:50.960
You did it, my boy.
You did it!

21:50.960 --> 21:53.040
Yeah, I guess I did.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.240
I'm sorry I didn't
listen to you, Shandu.

21:55.240 --> 22:00.120
Actually, I should be
apologizing to you.

22:00.120 --> 22:04.040
You see, I've been trusted
with this wand

22:04.040 --> 22:06.040
for far too long now.

22:06.040 --> 22:10.160
I've been searching
for someone to take my place.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.720
That's why I handed it
to you in the first place.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.880
Me?

22:17.720 --> 22:19.360
You've passed the test.

22:19.360 --> 22:20.840
I don't believe it.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.440
It's magic is very
powerful, my son.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.280
Learn to use it.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.600
How?

22:25.600 --> 22:26.880
I don't know
what to do.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.600
You'll know.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.680
Besides,
I won't be far away.

22:32.680 --> 22:36.520
For now, I leave you
with just one more rule--

22:36.520 --> 22:38.600
magic rule number 4.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.680
Always leave them
wanting more.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.160
You're not going to believe
the night I've had.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.160
Hey, where's my tree?

23:04.200 --> 23:07.400
And that's the last Todd
saw of the old magician.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.760
Good story.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.280
Wait up.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.600
Hey!

23:41.600 --> 23:43.240
You coming,
or what?
