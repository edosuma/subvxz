WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.571
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

00:06.615 --> 00:08.225
- Effective immediately,
you are stripped of your title

00:08.269 --> 00:10.445
as co-chair of oncology as well
as deputy medical director.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.360
- We're adopting?
- I can explain.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.492
- You could if you
were coming home tonight.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.059
- These women
are our patients.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.496
They need our help,
so we are going to Rikers.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.064
- Table three is now open.
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.631
- Thank you.
- Jackie Conner.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.067
- Get off me!
- Four injured!

00:24.111 --> 00:25.851
We need the medic.
- Get 'em to New Amsterdam.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.157
- You're here from Rikers.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.593
You overdosed
and it damaged your heart.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.334
- This is because
I turned state's witness.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.162
Someone's trying to kill me.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.473
- Guard?

00:50.180 --> 00:51.355
- Came as soon as I heard.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.401
If Brantley thinks
that she can demote you--

00:53.444 --> 00:55.446
- She can, Max.
And she did.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.100
- No, no, no, no,
I'm gonna fix this.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.232
All right, I'll call HCC.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.624
I will make an appeal
to the board--

00:59.668 --> 01:03.237
- The vote was unanimous.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.716
I'm lucky that I wasn't fired.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.544
- Fired? Do you think I would
let that happen to you?

01:06.588 --> 01:08.416
If Brantley doesn't
reinstate you immediately,

01:08.459 --> 01:09.634
then she can demote me, too.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.549
- Oh, Max,
I don't need you to fix this.

01:11.593 --> 01:12.898
I don't need you
to threaten people.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.684
I just need some time to think.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.338
- What is there to think about?

01:17.381 --> 01:18.469
- What...

01:18.513 --> 01:21.168
what am I still doing here?

01:21.211 --> 01:22.386
- Okay, listen to me.
By the end of the week,

01:22.430 --> 01:23.518
you're gonna have
everything back, okay?

01:23.561 --> 01:25.563
Your department.
Deputy medical director.

01:25.607 --> 01:26.869
In the meantime,
there's your patients,

01:26.912 --> 01:30.307
your committees.
We still need you here, okay?

01:30.351 --> 01:34.355
I... I need you here.

01:36.183 --> 01:39.099
- And what about what I need?

01:40.883 --> 01:43.712
'Cause I don't think I'm gonna
find it at New Amsterdam.

01:46.889 --> 01:50.153
- So what are you...

01:50.197 --> 01:52.460
you're gonna leave?

01:52.503 --> 01:54.810
- I'm...

01:54.853 --> 01:59.380
I'm looking
for a reason to stay.

01:59.423 --> 02:01.643
And right now,
I can't find one.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.437
- Max.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.612
What they did
to Helen is just--

02:14.656 --> 02:16.179
- Yeah, I know.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.354
- We were a team.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.573
If Helen hadn't
brought you my way,

02:18.616 --> 02:20.401
your cancer wouldn't be
in remission.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.229
And all that money
she raised for my research,

02:22.272 --> 02:24.361
she didn't deserve this.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.494
Frankly, I don't know
how I can fill her shoes.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.800
I can't replace
what she brings.

02:28.844 --> 02:31.281
But do you think
you could help me reset?

02:31.325 --> 02:32.282
Rally the troops?

02:32.326 --> 02:34.197
- Of course.

02:34.241 --> 02:37.461
- There's going to be a lot
of tough decisions to make.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.811
I'm glad you have my back.

02:39.855 --> 02:43.424
- So when you say
that you are moving to Idaho,

02:43.467 --> 02:46.470
do you mean
after having the baby?

02:46.514 --> 02:50.648
- I actually just gave
my two weeks' notice.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.128
- So soon?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.478
- Well, the pregnancy's really
doing a number on my OCD.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.958
All my fears are heightened,

02:56.001 --> 02:57.786
my compulsions are more vivid,

02:57.829 --> 02:59.831
so I can't really
do this without help,

02:59.875 --> 03:01.485
without my parents.

03:01.529 --> 03:02.747
- Of course.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.227
It's just that...

03:04.271 --> 03:05.968
Idaho is so very far away.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.492
- I know.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.712
But I have to do
what's best for the baby.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.453
- All surgical residents
to OR 6.

03:12.496 --> 03:15.412
All surgical residents
to OR 6.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.849
- Zach, Zach, I won't be mad.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.243
I just...I feel like
I'm going crazy.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.592
Just tell me
that you took my pill

03:21.636 --> 03:24.247
to teach me a lesson
or to demonstrate--

03:24.291 --> 03:25.683
- I didn't take your pill.

03:25.727 --> 03:26.815
And the more you accuse me,

03:26.858 --> 03:28.643
the more you sound
like a drug fiend.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.254
- I'm in agony.
Please.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.647
Please, just give me my meds.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.779
- I can't do that.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.738
- But I'm not gonna make it.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.870
- You are gonna make it.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.524
May be the worst day
of your life,

03:40.568 --> 03:41.525
but you're gonna make it.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.267
Fine.

03:44.311 --> 03:48.576
Fine. Then I am gonna make this
the worst day of your life.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.840
- Oh.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.581
Yeah.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.366
Hi. Hey.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.759
I'm so glad you came.
Thank you.

03:57.802 --> 04:01.589
- You texted 52 times,
so of course I came.

04:01.632 --> 04:04.940
- Yeah, I just wanted
to explain myself.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.898
- And I want to give you
the space to do that,

04:06.942 --> 04:08.335
but I still feel--

04:08.378 --> 04:09.727
- You're upset.
I know, I know.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.425
I hear you.
Believe me.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.643
I've had plenty
of time to think

04:12.687 --> 04:15.080
on the new bed over here,

04:15.124 --> 04:18.345
and the good news
is that this has all just been

04:18.388 --> 04:20.521
one big misunderstanding.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.871
- Iggy, you tried to adopt
another child

04:22.914 --> 04:24.612
without discussing it with me.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.570
That's not a misunderstanding.

04:26.614 --> 04:29.921
- Martin, I just--hi.

04:29.965 --> 04:33.534
- Dr. Frome,
sorry to interrupt.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.753
- Yeah, now's not really
the best time, Dr. Park.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.407
- Sorry, yes.
Sorry.

04:37.451 --> 04:41.629
Um, I'm here
for my performance review.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.545
- Right.
Um, yes, you are.

04:44.588 --> 04:48.592
This will just take
about an hour, tops.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.726
- Take all the time you need.
Ah, man.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.470
- Excuse me.
Martin, hey, hey, hey.

04:56.513 --> 04:59.429
Martin, Martin.
Hey, Martin, wait, wait, wait.

04:59.473 --> 05:02.432
It's just that I have to give
Tabitha some bad news.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.348
She can't assert herself,
and I don't think she's cut out

05:05.392 --> 05:06.436
to be a therapist,
and I've been putting off

05:06.480 --> 05:07.698
telling her
for as long as I can.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.961
I can't put it off anymore.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.617
Please.

05:14.662 --> 05:17.012
- Good-bye, Ig.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.976
- So if Evie takes a job
in San Francisco,

05:25.020 --> 05:27.936
are you gonna have
a long distance marriage?

05:27.979 --> 05:29.459
- That's not a thing, right?

05:29.503 --> 05:31.461
Long-distance marriage
is an oxymoron.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.811
- My friend met his fiancÃ©e
on Asian Charm,

05:33.855 --> 05:35.639
and they still haven't even
met each other in person.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.467
- Well,
with the right data plan,

05:37.511 --> 05:39.774
I predict a lifetime
of happiness for them.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.472
- I'm just saying distance
doesn't mean no connection.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.387
Some of my
deepest conversations

05:44.431 --> 05:46.389
have been over text.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.477
- See,
that's why my generation

05:47.521 --> 05:49.827
is better than your generation.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.006
- Good.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.926
Guard!

06:01.970 --> 06:04.842
I need help here now!

06:07.149 --> 06:09.020
- Is he--
- He's got a pulse.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.674
- Where are your friends?
- I don't know.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.763
They told me--they told me
to go to the bathroom.

06:12.807 --> 06:16.201
Please,
I don't know anything else.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.769
- His sidearm's missing.

06:21.946 --> 06:22.904
- Code silver.
I repeat.

06:22.947 --> 06:25.472
We have a code silver.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.649
- This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.999
- Central, we're en route.

06:31.042 --> 06:34.219
- This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.445
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.884
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.103
- Hey, what's going on?
What's a code silver?

06:48.146 --> 06:49.496
- It's a combative person
with a weapon.

06:49.539 --> 06:50.671
- All right, all right.
- Get back in my office.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.629
Let's go.
- Move to the nearest room.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.066
- Hey, wait.
In there.

06:58.156 --> 07:01.551
- Code silver.
Move to the nearest room.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.121
- That's not gonna work,
darling.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.296
No one's coming or going.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.037
- Dr. Hiiji said
if the pain got worse

07:09.080 --> 07:11.692
to press the call button.

07:11.735 --> 07:15.130
Push me over.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.830
Where's the pain?

07:22.006 --> 07:24.182
- Dr. Hiiji was monitoring
your appendix?

07:24.226 --> 07:27.055
- Yeah.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.579
- Well, it's about to rupture.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.192
- This is a code silver.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.891
- Max.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.936
- It's okay.
They're with me.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.637
- Dr. Goodwin, you ready?

07:48.555 --> 07:50.208
- This is a code silver.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.210
- Yeah.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.737
Lock this door,
and do not let anyone in or out

07:56.780 --> 07:58.782
under any circumstances
until I get back, okay?

07:58.826 --> 08:01.481
- Please evacuate
the hallways.

08:14.319 --> 08:17.975
- Copy that.

08:21.022 --> 08:25.156
- This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.552
- Ella.

08:29.596 --> 08:30.640
Ella?

08:30.684 --> 08:32.860
- This is a code silver.

08:34.035 --> 08:37.560
Move to the nearest room.
Code silver.

08:37.604 --> 08:41.085
Move to the nearest room
and wait for authorities.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.568
This is a code silver.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.659
- Okay, listen up.
We still have a job to do.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.749
Everybody needs to maintain
their focus on the patient

08:52.793 --> 08:54.272
and the operation at hand.

08:54.316 --> 08:55.622
We may be on lockdown,

08:55.665 --> 08:56.623
but it's nothing
we can't handle.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.015
- High levels of catecholamine.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.801
Cardiotoxicity indicated.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.803
Likely a combination of--

09:14.292 --> 09:16.643
- We have three Rikers
inmates on the loose.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.166
Overtook a guard in the ED,
stole his gun.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.167
- The guard, how is he?

09:19.210 --> 09:20.255
- Stable.
- Good.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.735
- We interrogated
the fourth inmate.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.563
She said that killing the guard
wasn't their motive.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.521
- Well, then what do they want?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.784
- She didn't know
or wouldn't say.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.525
Our culprits are
Dominique Ann Reed,

09:29.569 --> 09:31.527
Suzan Parker,
Jackie Conner.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.529
- Jackie Conner?
- You know her?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.618
- No, I--we had a team
at Rikers today,

09:35.662 --> 09:37.446
and she helped us.
Are you sure that she--

09:37.489 --> 09:40.188
- Positive. We've got officers
on every exit and stairwell.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.191
Shut down all the elevators.
Now we need to do a sweep.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.714
- I'll come with you.
I need to triage

09:44.758 --> 09:46.673
who's stable enough to stay
and who needs to be evacuated.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.544
- Max,
where are we releasing people?

09:48.588 --> 09:49.632
I need to get
my patient to Baptist.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.634
She needs constant care.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.375
- How about establish
a single egress point?

09:53.418 --> 09:54.724
So we can clear
everyone properly,

09:54.768 --> 09:56.552
but keep
the prisoners contained.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.859
- Uh, basement.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.383
Basement.

10:10.653 --> 10:13.525
- Ella, come with me.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.665
It's okay.
We are safe in here.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.668
- I don't--I don't feel safe.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.236
No. Sorry.

10:28.279 --> 10:31.543
- Is there anything
I can do that might help?

10:31.587 --> 10:33.328
- I, um--

10:33.371 --> 10:36.418
I like to organize things
from largest to smallest.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.462
- Okay.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.681
- I know that sounds stupid,
but--

10:38.725 --> 10:41.728
- No, no, it's not stupid.
It's not stupid.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.818
Oh.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.518
- Threes are better.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.825
- Three?

10:51.868 --> 10:53.783
- This is a code silver.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.655
- Oh, I hate this so much.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.265
These kids have enough trauma
in their lives

10:57.308 --> 10:59.615
without alarms blaring and--
- They're safe.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.313
There's nothing more
you can do for them.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.619
And you said
you wanted to talk to me,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.317
so talk.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.624
- Martin, forgive me I can't
focus on us right now.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.712
- No, now seems like

11:09.756 --> 11:11.453
the perfect time
to focus on us,

11:11.496 --> 11:13.629
considering we're gonna be
locked in a room together,

11:13.673 --> 11:16.763
alone for the first time
in God knows how long.

11:23.334 --> 11:24.727
- This is a code silver.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.469
Please evacuate the hallways.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.386
- Okay, right this way.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.692
Let's line up over here,

11:32.735 --> 11:34.215
and make sure
that you show your ID bands

11:34.258 --> 11:36.478
on the way out, okay?

11:36.521 --> 11:37.479
- How did this happen?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.786
- Jackie from Rikers.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.613
- What?
- Dr. Goodwin.

11:41.657 --> 11:44.225
We need you over here.
- Yeah, okay.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.792
I know this
isn't your responsibility,

11:45.835 --> 11:47.228
and I can understand
why you'd want to just

11:47.271 --> 11:48.403
check out of here
right about now,

11:48.446 --> 11:50.579
but I can really,
really use your help.

11:50.622 --> 11:51.580
- No, of course, go.

11:51.623 --> 11:52.886
I'll keep things
moving down here.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.631
- I'm so sorry, Lenore.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.372
Security won't let me
leave my office,

12:01.416 --> 12:03.331
but Dr. Bloom
will take good care of you.

12:03.374 --> 12:06.247
- Okay, I'm gonna need clamps,
retractors.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.684
- Supply cabinet.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.686
- Are you out of your mind?
Are you even a surgeon?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.948
- I did my rotations.

12:11.992 --> 12:15.212
Okay, I need that tray.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.474
- If you put any weight
on that leg of yours,

12:16.518 --> 12:17.519
the bone will snap.

12:17.562 --> 12:18.520
- I am not
the patient right now.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.826
- Yes, you are.
- Gloves?

12:19.869 --> 12:23.481
- You're my patient.
You're my responsibility.

12:27.355 --> 12:30.314
- You might as well
take a second pill.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.402
You're sure as hell
gonna need it.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.584
- I can't operate on narcotics.

12:39.628 --> 12:40.890
Besides...

12:40.934 --> 12:42.805
she's gonna need this
more than me.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.807
Come on.

12:44.851 --> 12:48.332
Okay.
Lenore, here.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.682
Now swallow.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.818
- Now give her a few more.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.740
- Security asked me to clear
the oncology department.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.874
- I'll come with you.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.574
- Helen.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.912
- Are you okay?
What happened?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.348
- I got separated
from my group,

13:47.391 --> 13:48.349
so I hid.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.090
- Okay, we've got you.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.310
- There you go.
Easy, easy.

13:55.356 --> 13:58.359
We're gonna get you
out of here.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.111
- I need a wider
field of vision, please.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.330
- On it.

14:33.481 --> 14:34.961
- How are you feeling?

14:35.004 --> 14:36.005
- Just want to get out of here.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.528
- How did you get injured?

14:37.572 --> 14:39.879
- It was all so scary.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.489
- Wait, wait, wait,
whoa, just lay down.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.577
Just say down.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.492
Just lay down, okay?

14:46.363 --> 14:48.452
- She's clammy,
and her pulse is rapid.

14:48.496 --> 14:51.368
- I need to examine
your injuries.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.327
Do you mind?
- Mm-mm.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.114
- Mm, sutures are broken.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.942
She could go
into hypovolemic shock.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.292
- I can keep pressure on it.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.253
- Okay. Uh...

15:06.296 --> 15:07.645
there's no signal.

15:07.689 --> 15:08.951
I'm gonna grab
gauze and tape.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.561
- Okay.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.957
- I just want to go home.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.964
- What happened
to your ID band?

15:22.008 --> 15:24.967
- Thought I was leaving.
Didn't need it anymore.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.160
- You know I never would've
gone through with it,

15:44.204 --> 15:46.119
right, Martin?

15:46.162 --> 15:48.164
Actually adopt
a child without telling you?

15:48.208 --> 15:51.298
I was gathering information
so that we could discuss it.

15:51.341 --> 15:53.169
- But we never did discuss it.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.954
What, were you just hoping
I wouldn't notice

15:54.997 --> 15:57.957
an extra kid
at the breakfast table?

15:59.088 --> 16:00.220
- I think you're overreacting.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.221
- Am I?

16:01.264 --> 16:02.570
- Yes.

16:02.613 --> 16:06.095
- All of our responsibilities,
our social life,

16:06.139 --> 16:09.664
everything we do
is on your terms.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.014
You obviously
don't care what I think.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.581
- That is not true.

16:13.624 --> 16:14.669
- Never mind.
You don't get it.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.323
- What, Martin? What--

16:16.366 --> 16:17.541
what don't I get?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.156
- Dr. Frome?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.635
- Yes?

16:24.679 --> 16:25.723
- Um...

16:25.767 --> 16:27.638
sorry, nothing.
Never mind.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.031
- No, no, no.
What?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.554
What is it?

16:30.598 --> 16:35.472
- Okay, I think maybe
Martin is saying that sometimes

16:35.516 --> 16:40.129
maybe you make him feel
like he's not enough for you.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.654
Which is none of my business.
I'm so sorry.

16:43.698 --> 16:44.655
Shouldn't have said anything.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.049
- No, that's fine, Tabitha.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.224
You're entitled
to your opinion.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.531
I just happen to think
that you are way,

16:50.574 --> 16:52.576
way off base.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.452
- She's right.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.027
- She's out.

17:10.507 --> 17:13.510
If you're really
gonna do this...

17:13.554 --> 17:15.773
now's the time.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.303
I think I need to be standing.

17:23.346 --> 17:26.393
- What, like an actual surgeon?

17:26.436 --> 17:29.091
- What if you
were to hold me up?

17:29.135 --> 17:32.486
It's the only thing
that might work.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.401
- All right.
Here we go.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.619
- Okay.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.099
- Three, two, one.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.104
- All right.
I got you.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.584
I got you.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.151
- Okay.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.284
- Well,
this isn't awkward at all.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.720
- If you drop me...

17:49.764 --> 17:51.200
- You'll probably
be in that wheelchair

17:51.244 --> 17:53.202
for the rest of your life.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.648
- Okay, I got what we need.

18:04.692 --> 18:05.649
- Max...
- Yeah?

18:05.693 --> 18:06.650
- We need to talk.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.522
- What?
- We need to talk.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.570
- None of this was my idea.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.094
I didn't touch that guard.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.617
I've never hurt
anyone in my life.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.141
Please.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.838
I don't want my daughters
thinking I'm some...

18:20.882 --> 18:24.277
- Okay, um, listen.
We're gonna help you.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.236
But you have to tell us
where the other inmates are.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.411
- If you fix me up,

18:28.455 --> 18:30.109
they're gonna
send me back to Rikers.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.110
- If we don't stop
the bleeding,

18:31.153 --> 18:34.113
you won't be going anywhere.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.421
- It all started when
Fran didn't die from the OD.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.380
They had to figure out
another way.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.512
So Jackie made us
all fight to get us over here.

18:42.556 --> 18:43.774
- Who's Fran?

18:43.818 --> 18:45.254
- I don't even know.

18:45.298 --> 18:49.389
Some state's witness who
wanted to snitch on someone.

18:49.432 --> 18:50.433
- That's Reynolds's patient.

18:50.477 --> 18:51.695
- Max, we have to warn him.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.088
- Are you--
- Yeah, no, go.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.568
Hurry.

18:56.918 --> 19:00.530
Dominique, this is gonna hurt.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.143
- So when I am scared,

19:04.186 --> 19:06.623
I say the alphabet backwards,
you know?

19:06.667 --> 19:10.105
Zed, Y, X, W...

19:11.411 --> 19:13.195
- Hello.
Hello, is anyone in there?

19:13.239 --> 19:15.284
- Don't.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.895
- Can you let me in?

19:17.939 --> 19:19.723
- Protocol is not
to open any doors

19:19.767 --> 19:22.204
until the danger
has been cleared.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.685
- Please, let me in!
There's nowhere else to go!

19:24.728 --> 19:25.686
- Vijay.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.557
Don't open it.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.430
- Let me in!

19:37.350 --> 19:40.179
- Did you warn Reynolds?

19:40.222 --> 19:41.528
- No.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.663
- Can you walk?

19:46.707 --> 19:48.578
- I don't know.
Why?

19:48.622 --> 19:51.929
- Dr. Goodwin's got a plan.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.454
- Getting you both out of here.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.459
- Note the WBP request.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.332
- Heart rate's a little fast.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.900
Hang another bag
of normal saline.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.294
- Grab a liter bag of normal
saline from the cabinet.

20:08.337 --> 20:11.253
- Re-warming agents
in the line.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.604
Oxygenator pressure normal.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.346
- One  dose.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.480
- Excuse me.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.785
- What's your name?

20:29.402 --> 20:30.446
Oh!

20:30.490 --> 20:31.839
- Someone stop her.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.754
- No, Duke, Duke, Duke!
Get back to the patient.

20:33.797 --> 20:34.798
- Call security.
- All right, you heard him.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.365
- We've got
several lacerations.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.540
Get the fluids going wide open.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.802
- Multiple stab wounds.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.283
Adipose tissue
and obliques involved.

20:41.327 --> 20:42.632
- Boss?
- No arterial spurt.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.808
- You're bleeding.
- Capillary leak only.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.855
Need a fresh suture kit.
Let's go.

20:53.164 --> 20:56.080
- You really think that you
can sneak them out of here?

20:56.124 --> 20:57.125
- It's the safest way.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.300
- Safest for who?

20:58.344 --> 21:00.128
- How much farther?
- Jackie.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.086
- Don't act like you know me.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.132
- Dominique needs help.
If you just let me take her--

21:04.175 --> 21:06.874
- I don't care about her
or about you, okay?

21:06.917 --> 21:08.397
- So after all the help
that you gave us in Rikers,

21:08.441 --> 21:10.878
after everything,
you were just using us?

21:10.921 --> 21:12.358
- Yeah,
that's show you survive.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.316
Her gang uses me,
I use you,

21:14.360 --> 21:15.361
everyone has a price,

21:15.404 --> 21:17.319
and everything
is for sale, right?

21:17.363 --> 21:19.103
We don't get
the luxury of caring.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.717
Give her your phone.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.284
Come on,
give her your phones right now.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.198
Hand them over.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.983
What do they say?

21:29.026 --> 21:30.027
- Uh, both the same.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.378
"Attack in OR 7.
Patient critical.

21:32.421 --> 21:35.903
Request 6 units
of AB plus ASAP."

21:35.946 --> 21:37.165
- That means Suzan
didn't get it done.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.254
Fran's still alive.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.734
We have to go back in.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.083
- Jackie, I can't do this.

21:42.126 --> 21:43.867
- Look, we don't have a choice.
Where's OR 7?

21:43.911 --> 21:44.912
- Jackie,
think about this, all right?

21:44.955 --> 21:46.392
The hospital is on lockdown.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.002
That means there will be cops,
guards everywhere.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.220
They will recognize you.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.918
Now, I am willing
to get you out of here,

21:50.961 --> 21:52.746
but there is no way
that I am taking you back

21:52.789 --> 21:55.183
to my hospital--
- Take me to OR 7.

21:55.226 --> 21:57.228
Right now.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.754
- I can take you there.

22:00.797 --> 22:04.235
I know a way to get you past
the cops and into the OR, but--

22:04.279 --> 22:07.717
but first, I'm gonna need you
to put the gun down.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.071
- Okay.
Start walking.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.859
Come on.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.080
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

22:24.865 --> 22:29.130
- Love, when I look at us,
I don't think that you're...

22:29.173 --> 22:31.959
not enough
or anything like that.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.396
I don't know how to explain it.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.965
- Can you think of an instance
where you felt like that?

22:40.141 --> 22:41.447
Barney.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.405
- The dinosaur?

22:43.449 --> 22:46.277
- No, it was a goat
that we rescued.

22:46.321 --> 22:49.455
- And guess where
Barney the goat lived.

22:49.498 --> 22:52.849
- He lived in the house
for--for a minute.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.504
- And the weird thing
is that...

22:55.548 --> 22:57.811
it was kinda great.

22:58.986 --> 23:03.207
He was strangely well mannered,
a great companion for the kids.

23:03.251 --> 23:06.863
Iggy adorably dressed him up
as a dog for Halloween.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.212
- Mm.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.344
- Made all his meals,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.128
even found him
this cute little goat bed.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.129
- In the spirit
of full disclosure,

23:12.173 --> 23:13.479
it wasn't really a goat bed

23:13.522 --> 23:17.483
because they don't
actually make those.

23:17.526 --> 23:21.138
- Yeah, but as I watched Iggy
take care of this animal,

23:21.182 --> 23:23.837
I realized...

23:23.880 --> 23:26.143
I'm jealous.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.928
Of a goat.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.495
And I'm not even a jealous guy.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.106
It's just,
he looked so happy.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.368
He always does.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.457
When he's helping,
volunteering,

23:35.501 --> 23:37.285
and that is so beautiful.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.982
But I wonder,

23:39.026 --> 23:42.029
do I ever make my husband
look like that?

23:43.334 --> 23:44.423
Am I even capable?

23:44.466 --> 23:47.034
- Martin.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.210
Of course you are.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.299
I...

23:51.342 --> 23:54.998
helping people is just
fundamentally part of who I am.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.131
- And, um, Dr. Frome,

23:57.174 --> 23:59.916
how do you think
that you help Martin?

24:01.918 --> 24:05.008
- I, um...

24:05.052 --> 24:07.620
I love him.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.013
With all my heart.

24:10.057 --> 24:12.276
- Well, that's...

24:12.320 --> 24:14.365
what I asked...

24:14.409 --> 24:16.585
did you help Martin
tell the kids

24:16.629 --> 24:19.980
that they couldn't keep
the goat as a pet?

24:20.023 --> 24:22.330
- Martin's at home
with the kids, so...

24:22.373 --> 24:23.636
- And Martin
had to tell a lawyer

24:23.679 --> 24:26.290
that he can't
take in a needy child.

24:26.334 --> 24:29.990
Do you think
that was maybe painful for him?

24:30.033 --> 24:31.295
- Yeah.

24:31.339 --> 24:35.212
- How often do your efforts
to mend hearts

24:35.256 --> 24:39.956
wind up with Martin
having to break them?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.958
Martin has asked you
to change your behavior,

24:42.002 --> 24:44.613
and you love him, right?

24:47.007 --> 24:50.097
So, I mean, maybe it's not
that you won't stop,

24:50.140 --> 24:52.360
and more that you can't.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.456
Why can't you stop,
Dr. Frome?

25:07.593 --> 25:09.203
- Stop moving.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.161
- Trying to retract
the far edge

25:11.205 --> 25:14.077
to make sure
the omentum is clear of pus.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.514
- In English.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.645
- I can't bend forward.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.952
I need you to move
to the other side.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.910
- But your leg--
- Forget about my leg.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.390
I won't die,
but if you don't do this,

25:22.433 --> 25:25.524
then Lenore will.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.221
- You ask me
to monitor your medication,

25:27.264 --> 25:28.657
and then you accuse me
of stealing it.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.137
You ask me to hold you up,

25:30.180 --> 25:32.095
and then a minute later
to drop you.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.575
Do you even care
about getting better?

25:33.619 --> 25:36.622
- Yes, I want to get better
so I can help.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.407
Otherwise, what's the point?

25:39.450 --> 25:42.453
Who am I getting better for?

25:45.369 --> 25:47.154
- All right.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.157
I'm gonna set you down.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.028
- Okay.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.395
I think I got it.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.963
I got it.

26:15.095 --> 26:18.402
Now we just need
to close her up.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.103
- That's her!
- She has a weapon!

26:23.146 --> 26:24.147
- Freeze!

26:24.191 --> 26:25.279
- Drop the weapon!

26:26.759 --> 26:29.239
- Shot fired, shots fired.
Inmate down.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.328
- Ella, we are safe.
The door is locked.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.634
- No, I...

26:32.678 --> 26:35.245
I usually--I usually
feel movement, but I don't.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.117
I put too much
stress on the baby.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.335
What if...

26:38.379 --> 26:40.381
what if I...

26:41.382 --> 26:43.384
I can't feel the baby, Vijay.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.082
- All clear.

26:50.086 --> 26:53.481
- O2 sat's 98.
Pressure 130/88.

26:53.524 --> 26:56.397
Dopamine at 7.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.485
Flushes are ready.

26:57.528 --> 27:00.357
- Dr. Reynolds,
can I help you?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.492
Boss, you okay?
You want me to take over?

27:04.535 --> 27:07.147
- Can I get a sponge count?

27:07.190 --> 27:08.714
We're not hitting
our hemodynamic targets.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.672
- L-sac's steady.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.152
- More irrigation, please.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.676
- BP's dropping.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.374
- There's a pumper
in here somewhere.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.681
- Now we're at 6.

27:21.596 --> 27:24.381
- Are you okay?

27:34.609 --> 27:37.177
Retract the lung.

27:38.526 --> 27:41.181
There.
There it is.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.748
- Femoral map
is the most accurate.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.711
- Pushing 4 milligrams
of fentanyl.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.191
- BP's stabilizing.

27:51.234 --> 27:52.758
- Eluting stent is in place.

27:52.801 --> 27:55.195
Sternal wires
and plates are ready.

27:55.238 --> 27:58.198
- Sternum set on the tray.

27:58.241 --> 28:00.200
- Helen, please don't do this.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.723
- Do you trust me?
- It's not about trust.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.159
- It is all about trust.

28:03.203 --> 28:06.119
If we don't have that,
then I truly don't belong here.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.477
- Who's there?
- Helen Sharpe, oncology.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.827
We were helping escort
patients to the evac route,

28:18.871 --> 28:20.350
but she's too critical
to make it.

28:20.394 --> 28:23.136
We need to get her
to the OR at once.

28:28.794 --> 28:29.882
This is Dr. Goodwin,

28:29.925 --> 28:32.493
the hospital's
medical director.

28:41.284 --> 28:43.591
- It's all right.
You need to let us through.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.772
- Go ahead.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.395
- How do you feel
when you help someone?

29:05.439 --> 29:08.181
- Um...

29:08.224 --> 29:10.052
like I'm here for a reason.

29:10.096 --> 29:13.099
- So how do you feel
when you don't?

29:14.665 --> 29:16.363
Everyone in the department
heard about the time

29:16.406 --> 29:18.887
that you gave your shoes
to a homeless man.

29:20.454 --> 29:23.674
Well, Imagine that
you just walked by him.

29:23.718 --> 29:26.808
How would you have felt?

29:26.852 --> 29:29.332
- Like a bad person.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.857
And I would've been.
He needed shoes.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.294
That's what you do.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.818
- Well,
a lot of people walked by him.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.428
Are they all bad people?

29:38.472 --> 29:40.735
- No.
Not at all.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.737
- So why are you?

29:45.261 --> 29:49.091
Can you try and list three
good things about yourself

29:49.135 --> 29:50.789
that have nothing
to do with helping?

29:50.832 --> 29:52.747
Three things that would
be great about yourself

29:52.791 --> 29:55.184
if you never adopt another kid,

29:55.228 --> 29:58.231
or rescue another goat.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.022
Okay, how about one thing?

30:17.163 --> 30:19.252
Dr. Frome...

30:19.295 --> 30:23.299
what do you think would happen
if you stopped helping people?

30:25.388 --> 30:29.044
- They'd see...

30:31.090 --> 30:33.005
- Iggy...

30:33.048 --> 30:34.441
what would they see?

30:40.926 --> 30:43.842
- They would see...

30:43.885 --> 30:47.280
what a complete loser I am.

30:47.323 --> 30:50.065
Just...

30:50.109 --> 30:55.854
corny, nerdy, fat,
worthless, nothing.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.203
Baby--
- No, I--Martin,

30:57.246 --> 31:01.250
I know it's not healthy,
and I...

31:02.991 --> 31:05.298
I have this voice in my head,

31:05.341 --> 31:08.170
and it's a really loud one.

31:11.217 --> 31:14.176
And it's saying...

31:14.220 --> 31:18.224
that one of these days,
you're gonna realize...

31:20.008 --> 31:22.315
That you can do
so much better than me.

31:28.408 --> 31:32.194
My ability to help people...

31:32.238 --> 31:35.197
that's all I have.
That's the...

31:35.241 --> 31:39.201
that's the only thing
I even like about myself.

31:44.076 --> 31:46.382
Without that,
I just can't think of a reason

31:46.426 --> 31:49.037
why you would keep me around.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.083
I can't.

31:52.519 --> 31:55.783
- Dr. Frome, I'm gonna ask
Martin to do something now,

31:55.826 --> 31:58.133
and it would great if you
could just sit and listen.

31:58.177 --> 31:59.178
Is that okay?

31:59.221 --> 32:01.789
- Yeah, okay.

32:01.832 --> 32:05.097
- Martin,
will you tell your husband

32:05.140 --> 32:09.188
three things that you think
are good about him?

32:13.018 --> 32:15.411
- You're kind.

32:15.455 --> 32:19.198
You are a wonderful father.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.939
And you are beautiful.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.421
You're hilarious.
You're patient.

32:25.465 --> 32:26.945
You're smart.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.512
You make friends
everywhere you go

32:29.556 --> 32:33.299
'cause they see what I see.

32:33.342 --> 32:36.389
You shine.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.304
You're amazing.

32:39.653 --> 32:42.308
You're the love of my life.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.266
And my life is so much better

32:44.310 --> 32:46.007
than I ever
thought it was gonna be

32:46.051 --> 32:50.055
because of you, Iggy.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.973
- I love you.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.933
I love you.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.545
If I could've stayed calm,

33:02.589 --> 33:04.112
this wouldn't have happened.

33:04.156 --> 33:06.549
If I were normal,
I could've been a mother.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.987
- You will still be a mother.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.553
A good mother,
a wonderful mother.

33:10.597 --> 33:11.902
- How?

33:11.946 --> 33:13.643
- Because your baby is okay.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.906
- You don't know that.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.299
- Okay.

33:17.343 --> 33:20.607
I will listen
to your baby's heartbeats,

33:20.650 --> 33:23.262
and that will tell you.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.046
- Okay.
Do you hear anything?

33:25.090 --> 33:28.267
- You need to slow down
your breathing.

33:28.310 --> 33:32.314
- I can't, I can't.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.490
- You said your OCD
makes you imagine

33:34.534 --> 33:37.667
the worst possible
circumstances.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.235
What if you imagine the best?

33:40.279 --> 33:45.066
Hm? Close your eyes and try.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.590
- Okay.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.027
- What do you see?

33:49.070 --> 33:51.594
- My baby.

33:51.638 --> 33:54.119
My healthy baby.

33:54.162 --> 33:56.164
- Where are you?

33:56.208 --> 33:58.601
- In New York.

33:58.645 --> 34:02.040
In a cozy nursery.
In a cozy apartment.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.694
It doesn't have to be fancy.
I'm not picky.

34:04.738 --> 34:10.526
- You can be picky.
It's your best life.

34:10.570 --> 34:15.053
- Okay, so then
I have a job that I love,

34:15.096 --> 34:17.446
even if I don't know
what that is.

34:17.490 --> 34:20.493
And I can support my family.

34:23.148 --> 34:26.977
And everything's okay.

34:27.021 --> 34:30.068
- I have something
for you to hear.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.005
- Are we getting close?

34:55.049 --> 34:57.399
- Yeah, the OR
is just through these doors.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.488
- Good, okay.

34:59.532 --> 35:02.448
- Do you trust me?
- With my life.

35:02.491 --> 35:03.449
- Gun!
- She's got a gun!

35:03.492 --> 35:05.146
- Drop your weapon!

35:07.148 --> 35:08.584
- Drop your gun!

35:08.628 --> 35:10.064
- Drop your weapon!
- Put it down!

35:10.108 --> 35:11.979
- Hands up!

35:13.285 --> 35:15.025
- Hands behind you.

35:15.069 --> 35:17.985
- David 1-5,
we've got one in custody.

35:18.028 --> 35:20.335
- Got any more weapons?

35:20.379 --> 35:23.033
Let's go.

35:32.521 --> 35:35.002
- All right.
- Yeah.

35:35.045 --> 35:36.264
- All right, folks,
it's all over.

35:36.308 --> 35:37.439
Come on in.
let's go.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.311
Come on.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.356
It's all over.
That's right.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.448
- Hey, hey.

35:46.492 --> 35:49.190
- âª Down in the valley
- I got you.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.193
- âª The first of May

35:55.196 --> 35:57.720
âª Gathering flowers

35:57.764 --> 36:01.420
- You said you don't need
a fancy apartment.

36:01.463 --> 36:04.553
Maybe you can move in with me.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.425
- âª Gathering flowers

36:06.468 --> 36:11.212
âª Both red and blue

36:11.256 --> 36:13.258
- I love you.
- I love you.

36:13.301 --> 36:16.304
See you at home.
- Yeah.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.658
So, Tabitha,
it goes without saying

36:22.702 --> 36:24.225
that you passed
your performance review

36:24.269 --> 36:27.402
with flying colors.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.317
- Well, in that spirit,
there's actually something else

36:29.361 --> 36:31.189
I'd love to share with you.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.494
- Yeah, of course.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.627
- Well,
the pattern of your behavior

36:34.670 --> 36:36.542
can actually be indicative

36:36.585 --> 36:40.285
of a more substantive diagnosis
per the DSM-5.

36:40.328 --> 36:41.851
- Such as?

36:41.895 --> 36:44.854
- Narcissistic
personality disorder.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.510
- âª To the bloom

36:48.554 --> 36:50.208
- Well...

36:50.251 --> 36:51.600
have a great night.
- Yeah.

36:51.644 --> 36:55.691
- âª Vine in the sweetest,
sweetest road âª

37:00.566 --> 37:03.395
- Dr. Bloom...

37:03.438 --> 37:07.442
you are actually
a very decent human being.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.229
- Don't tell anyone.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.882
- Um...

37:12.926 --> 37:17.365
I thought that...

37:17.409 --> 37:21.891
I could be there for you,
but I...

37:21.935 --> 37:24.764
I--I can't.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.809
- You were great.

37:29.899 --> 37:31.466
- I took the pill.

37:33.599 --> 37:37.385
In fact, I took quite a few.

37:37.429 --> 37:41.389
I know what I've done is...

37:41.433 --> 37:44.305
beyond.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.350
I know that I need help.

37:45.393 --> 37:47.221
I've already lost
all my family,

37:47.265 --> 37:49.658
and my friend.

37:49.702 --> 37:52.705
I can't afford
to lose everyone else.

38:17.382 --> 38:20.385
- When you finish rehab...

38:22.822 --> 38:25.520
Don't call me.

38:25.564 --> 38:28.567
Don't email me.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.786
Don't text me.

38:30.830 --> 38:33.572
I can't ever see you again.

38:33.615 --> 38:36.618
But you know that, right?

38:36.662 --> 38:39.665
- âª Deep as she could be

38:42.885 --> 38:45.888
âª But not so deeply

38:45.932 --> 38:48.543
- Stand right here, please.
- All right.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.763
Feet still.

38:54.549 --> 38:58.336
- âª I sing this way

38:58.379 --> 39:03.253
âª Don't you?

39:06.387 --> 39:08.215
- Are you okay?

39:10.826 --> 39:12.219
Thank God
those criminals were caught.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.003
Today's been a nightmare.

39:14.047 --> 39:17.355
- Yeah, well, every day's
a nightmare for those women.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.487
- Are you defending them?

39:19.531 --> 39:23.491
- Nope. But it's still our job
to help them.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.537
- Is it?

39:32.500 --> 39:36.722
- âª Don't you

39:39.768 --> 39:41.640
- Don't scare me
like that again.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.992
It's all good.
I'm right here, baby.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.429
- Life's too short
for long distance.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.997
I'm turning down the job
in San Francisco.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.521
- Don't.

39:53.565 --> 39:57.612
San Francisco's sounding
really good right about now.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.919
- âª Break my heart

39:59.962 --> 40:02.443
- Let's get out of here.

40:07.883 --> 40:10.973
- âª Thousands and thousands

40:11.017 --> 40:14.542
âª All along this earth

40:25.814 --> 40:27.555
- I'm...

40:27.599 --> 40:31.037
I'm sorry that
I put you in danger.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.431
But I didn't know
what else to do.

40:33.474 --> 40:36.738
- It was the only thing to do.

40:36.782 --> 40:39.045
It was brave.

40:39.088 --> 40:40.916
And selfless.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.832
Smart.
It was you.

40:43.876 --> 40:48.968
And you deserve to be
at a place that sees you,

40:49.011 --> 40:51.449
that appreciates you.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.451
100%.

40:55.670 --> 40:57.019
And if that place
isn't New Amsterdam,

40:57.063 --> 40:59.326
then you should go.

40:59.369 --> 41:01.589
You should go.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.373
No matter how much
I want you to stay,

41:03.417 --> 41:05.941
and I...

41:05.985 --> 41:09.989
It's not about what I want.

41:12.992 --> 41:16.125
And, yeah,
it'll be weird not...

41:16.169 --> 41:18.127
seeing you every day,

41:18.171 --> 41:22.741
and I will miss you, but...

41:22.784 --> 41:24.264
we live in the same city,
right?

41:24.307 --> 41:28.398
So we can always get a coffee
or eat, you know, something,

41:28.442 --> 41:31.140
food together, or...

41:31.184 --> 41:34.492
- Max.
- What?

41:34.535 --> 41:35.667
- I'm not going anywhere.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.712
- You're not?

41:40.846 --> 41:42.630
So you just let me
do that whole awkward

41:42.674 --> 41:44.806
rambling speech for no reason?

41:44.850 --> 41:46.373
- Yes.
- Okay, well, great.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.636
Thanks.

41:48.680 --> 41:49.637
It's not cool.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.167
- So you...

41:58.211 --> 42:00.387
found a reason to stay.
