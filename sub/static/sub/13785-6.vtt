01:40.058 --> 01:43.394
Charlie:
Fuckin' postal contract.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.105
Got to bring these in first thing.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.651
I'll be right with you.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.699
Is he only a goddamn fool

01:56.867 --> 01:59.452
or so stupid he thinks
he's accomplished something?

02:01.872 --> 02:04.457
- Who?
- You know goddamn well who I mean.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.127
- Who are you?
- You goddamn well know that too.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.214
I know from the sheriff
locking you up

02:11.381 --> 02:14.592
between sundown when I left
and my coming back now,

02:14.760 --> 02:17.428
you must have fucked up
at the interval.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.391
- Were you drunk?
- You and I have met.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.646
- At the hotel buffet.
- Yes.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.731
But we wasn't introduced.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.358
I'm George Hearst.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.278
Were you drunk, George Hearst?

02:37.699 --> 02:40.076
This fellow didn't
keep you up here, did he?

02:40.244 --> 02:43.913
He didn't like fart or snore
too much for you, did he, Mr. Hearst?

02:44.081 --> 02:45.748
I mean, he imbi--

02:45.916 --> 02:47.750
Holy shit!

02:47.918 --> 02:50.378
Jesus!
The cocksucker's dead, George!

02:51.922 --> 02:55.132
Look, he's got a fuckin' knife
in his chest.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.511
That ain't your fuckin' knife,
is it, George Hearst?

03:01.765 --> 03:03.975
Fields: Goddamn fool.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.102
Jane: Won't be the first
the worms work on.

03:06.270 --> 03:09.564
I guess he deserves more than
a dirt burying by some stranger,

03:09.731 --> 03:11.190
even for only how big

03:11.358 --> 03:14.026
a fuckin' nigger he was.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.947
Don't know if using this trough
was that big a fuckin' time saver.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.157
I'll see to the burying with you.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.201
I owe a visit up there anyways.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.621
That ain't gonna raise your popularity
with your fellow white people.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.833
Question I wake to in the morning
and pass out with at night:

03:29.001 --> 03:32.169
"What's my popularity
with my fellow white people?"

03:32.337 --> 03:36.757
I suppose we ought to go get him.
He ain't fuckin' pretty to look at.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.264
Neither are you, fuckin' Nigger General.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.474
Seth:
After that I arrested Hearst.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.936
Took him by the ear and led him
to jail, where he remains.

03:56.528 --> 03:59.405
Hearst had no particular
connection to Mr. Hostetler?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.782
Both their names begin with H.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.120
- It's gonna get bad here, Martha.
- (knocks on door)

04:06.288 --> 04:09.290
It's Albert Swearengen,
regrettin' the early hour and...

04:09.458 --> 04:11.709
that I call without notice...

04:16.339 --> 04:18.007
Good morning. Come in.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.761
...knowing I intrude.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.513
- Mrs. Bullock.
- Good morning, Mr. Swearengen.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.349
Will you have meat and eggs?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.893
- I'd be grateful for coffee.
- Please sit down.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.733
Swell, stem to stern-- the place.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.529
If you will not eat,
will you excuse me?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.534
- Teaches the camp's children.
- Excellent.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.537
- I'll walk you when you're ready.
- There's no burning rush.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.916
I'm sure the talk Mr. Swearengen
would have with you must be important.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.885
Al: Last night
from my balcony vantage,

05:03.053 --> 05:07.139
I watched you drag Hearst by the ear
to Utter's freight office.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.102
I was awaitin' you comin' out of Utter's,
thinking that you might

05:11.269 --> 05:14.313
make a call on me, tell me what
the fuck was going forward,

05:14.481 --> 05:19.110
but you did not appear.
I finally asked myself,

05:19.277 --> 05:23.280
"Could our sheriff
have took another route home,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.449
maybe through Chinaman's Alley?

05:25.617 --> 05:28.369
And what would that bespeak
of his frame of mind?"

05:28.537 --> 05:31.122
It bespoke I didn't fuckin'
feel like talking to you.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.916
"Al, busy night, short on joy."

05:34.084 --> 05:36.585
Could have told me that.
"Let's talk another time."

05:38.130 --> 05:41.632
I too, Bullock, when suspecting
I've fucked the dog,

05:41.800 --> 05:44.218
keenly seek some solitude.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.262
Our hour is wrong.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.724
Having lost his man Turner,
being embarrassed by you,

05:49.891 --> 05:53.936
Hearst will be on the muscle.
And we who will be

05:54.104 --> 05:58.524
his wrath's object
ought to stay close and confide.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.735
Our alternative is flight.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.154
- Does that appeal?
- No.

06:03.321 --> 06:07.533
We ain't that sort,
which is maybe more the pity.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.498
- Walk me to school now, Mr. Bullock?
- Yes.

06:14.666 --> 06:18.794
- Thank you for the coffee.
- You're very welcome, Mr. Swearengen.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.470
- Owie.
- Well, Sofia...

06:27.637 --> 06:30.598
- we're almost through.
- It's cold.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.476
The fire's gone out.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.733
Mr. Ellsworth left for the diggings
early this morning.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.194
He didn't come to kiss me good night.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.783
- You must not have wakened.
- I always waken from his beard.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.702
Well, last night you must not have.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.415
There. You look more
than presentable.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.004
Excuse me just a moment,
and then I'll take you to school.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.225
(clears throat)
Mornin', Dan.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.478
Jewel, you got you another customer!

07:17.646 --> 07:21.398
Just brought me mine.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.568
- How do you-- how do you feel?
- (gun clanks)

07:27.656 --> 07:30.533
You go ahead and drink that.
That's at least my third damn cup.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.369
I'm jangle-nerved already.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.162
Let me go on and get shaky-handed,

07:35.330 --> 07:37.915
pop my foot on the floor
like I'm a-listenin' to banjo music!

07:38.083 --> 07:40.292
- (chuckles)
- Dan: Shhh.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.673
- Al's out.
- Out where?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.675
Well, I don't know.

07:47.843 --> 07:51.345
But I bet you a nickel it has somethin'
to do with Bullock takin' Hearst by the ear

07:51.513 --> 07:53.597
from Tolliver's to Utter's depot.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.766
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

07:55.934 --> 07:58.269
Anyways, here's Jewel.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.731
(Steve slurring)
We had been at odds but settled,

08:02.899 --> 08:05.776
Hostetler and me.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.903
He'd sold me his livery,

08:08.071 --> 08:11.532
and fixing to move to Oregon,

08:11.700 --> 08:15.536
pickin' up his fuckin' shotgun,
the Negro stumbled and...

08:15.704 --> 08:18.998
blew his black head off!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.167
(coughs, hawks)

08:23.628 --> 08:26.755
God damn it, Harry.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.761
Steve: And I fear no retribution,
not by my own God...

08:34.806 --> 08:36.432
or any other...

08:36.600 --> 08:38.851
evil emissary's dispatch

08:39.019 --> 08:41.312
from the bowels of the earth

08:41.479 --> 08:43.647
by whatever bundle of bloody

08:43.815 --> 08:46.942
fuckin' feathers and housecat teeth

08:47.110 --> 08:49.612
the nigger race bows down to.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.825
My hands are fuckin' clean,

08:54.993 --> 08:58.662
and my heart is quiet.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.251
Oh, Christ.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.088
Harry?

09:09.090 --> 09:10.966
(keys jangling)

09:44.876 --> 09:47.211
Hurry up, Richardson.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.673
Thwart that Abyssinian.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.842
Richardson:
I don't know what you mean.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.679
Any thought he has of registerin'.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.139
Bad enough we have one in help.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.978
- Hello.
- Hello.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.230
- We can't take you.
- Lou: My baby!

10:07.440 --> 10:09.692
Ooh!

10:09.859 --> 10:12.820
- Ooh!
- Your baby's growed, Mama.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.155
Oh, come on, come on.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.700
Come around back.
We'll get you into my room.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.787
You're so beautiful! Oh!

10:21.955 --> 10:24.206
Did you hear, Richardson?

10:24.374 --> 10:26.750
- (sarcastically) "Beautiful."
- Yes.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.172
You make clear to Tolliver
you will not confide entirety

10:32.340 --> 10:34.967
and that he oughtn't to expect
you ever fuckin' will

10:35.135 --> 10:37.177
is the basic foundation attitude.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.556
- (yelling) Am I fuckin' boring you?!
- No.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.183
Hmm? Sure you don't want
to tell me a joke or the like,

10:43.351 --> 10:46.270
- or dance a quick fuckin' jig?
- I tell Tolliver I'm still your man

10:46.438 --> 10:48.522
and I'll never show him
your fuckin' hole card.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.817
Guy like Tolliver always believes he can
see what you want not to show him.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.570
I'm tryin' not to show your hole card.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.948
- That's your fuckin' act.
- So what do I say about Bullock?

10:58.116 --> 11:01.535
What you say to Tolliver:
"I know why Bullock acted,

11:01.703 --> 11:04.747
but I'm not prepared to say.
That's confidential and privileged

11:04.914 --> 11:07.666
between me and Mr. Swearengen,
who explained to me exactly."

11:07.834 --> 11:09.460
What'll Tolliver think off that?

11:09.627 --> 11:13.422
"This kid don't know what the fuck
Bullock's doin' and Swearengen don't either.

11:13.590 --> 11:18.093
But I, Cy Tolliver, wormed that the fuck out
of him, even though he tried not to let me.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.137
I can handle this fuckin' piss-pot."

11:22.098 --> 11:23.932
(clicks tongue)

11:24.100 --> 11:26.727
Fold your thumb,
go over and fuckin' talk to him.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.074
When you're done woolgathering,
I'd like this sent.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.459
How are you today?

11:50.627 --> 11:52.544
Well enough, Mr. Hearst.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.713
- And you?
- (telegraph tapping)

11:54.881 --> 11:56.632
Well enough.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.259
What do say of me in your paper?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.595
I have nothing to report, sir.

12:01.763 --> 12:05.182
- Have you anything to give me?
- I have not.

12:06.518 --> 12:09.895
$1 .25, please.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.064
25¢ increase to our rate.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.494
Cy: Damn pleased we got
to speak, Adams.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.330
Al chose well making you
his fuckin' ambassador.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.834
Far as him grabbin' Hearst by the ear,
how that affects yours and Mr. Swearengen's

12:32.001 --> 12:34.586
- arrangements with Hearst--
- Fuckin' Bullock.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.631
--Al's got specific ideas on that.
As soon as he's sure he wouldn't

12:37.799 --> 12:41.218
be unintentionally misleadin' you,
he'll want me to confide 'em in detail.

12:41.386 --> 12:45.222
Why don't you cap your visit with some
complimentary higher-end pussy?

12:45.390 --> 12:48.684
- Thanks anyway.
- You know Leon here.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.522
Why don't you teach him
somethin' about craps?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.275
Soon as I finish showin' water
how to run downhill.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.901
(Cy laughs)

13:01.614 --> 13:06.785
He'd have me a cur to paw through
the scraps his fuckin' flunky tosses.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.912
That Swearengen.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.956
When here, Leon,

13:11.124 --> 13:13.792
telling me about the hobby
you and Mrs. Ellsworth share,

13:13.960 --> 13:15.836
you walk me in Mr. Hearst's front door

13:16.004 --> 13:19.548
and sit me the fuck down
across from him at his fuckin' table.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.594
- God bless you, boy.
- Thanks, Mr. Tolliver.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.103
I'm going to
the hardware store, Charlie.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.397
I hope so.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.066
A little early to start drinkin'.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.406
Thought I'd stick around with you.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.371
- Morning, Charlie.
- Mornin'.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.086
Busy night last night, I hear.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.433
Hearst: I recall my instructions
to you as bein'

14:11.601 --> 14:15.270
that anytime you and I meet,
Swearengen's to be represented.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.356
Heard and understood, Mr. Hearst.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.318
And I hope correctly honored in
the breach in this one single instance.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.403
Make your case.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.115
Not to read your mind,

14:27.283 --> 14:29.910
but it seemed your idea
for Swearengen and me

14:30.078 --> 14:32.704
had to do with this newer phase
we're movin' into--

14:32.872 --> 14:35.791
camp's official business and the like.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.460
Swearengen and me unofficially

14:38.628 --> 14:40.128
seein' to your interests.

14:40.296 --> 14:45.133
Because the small-mindedness
and self-interested behavior

14:45.301 --> 14:49.429
that's so pervasive in this shithole
makes impossible

14:49.597 --> 14:53.308
my efficient attention to
the requirements of my operation.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.103
Well, I can only imagine
what that's like, sir.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.897
Man who's accomplished
what you have, havin' to move

14:59.065 --> 15:01.650
among the low-rent cocksuckers
and short-haulers--

15:01.818 --> 15:05.571
Make your fuckin' case why you've
gone against my instructions.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.365
I come into a certain
piece of knowledge, sir,

15:08.533 --> 15:11.994
that could make this more or less
a fuckin' company town.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.831
And my thinking was if communicatin'
this privately to Mr. Hearst

15:15.999 --> 15:20.085
risks putting me and Al Swearengen
the fuck out of action as middlemen,

15:20.253 --> 15:22.546
so the fuck be it.

15:24.299 --> 15:28.093
Suppose I could put the Ellsworth claim
into play for you, Mr. Hearst?

15:31.180 --> 15:34.391
- How?
- The lady's reinvolved herself

15:34.559 --> 15:37.811
with a habit turns
a person's life upside down.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.772
One of my own fuckin'
employees supplies her,

15:40.940 --> 15:42.899
God help me, and that's a habit, sir,

15:43.067 --> 15:47.029
makes a person subject to accident
and mischance of every fuckin' sort,

15:47.196 --> 15:49.615
having to do especially
with the ups and downs

15:49.782 --> 15:52.659
of the fucking quality of the fucking shit
she's being given.

15:52.827 --> 15:55.037
I wish I'd heard this yesterday.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.415
I'll confide that wantin'

15:58.583 --> 16:00.876
to honor your instructions to the letter

16:01.044 --> 16:03.045
cost me 24 hours
before approaching you.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.048
If I had, my instructions
would have had to do

16:06.215 --> 16:08.508
with bringing the inevitable about.

16:08.676 --> 16:12.262
In the interval,
I have suffered certain losses.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.431
Oh, rest fucking Captain Turner's soul.

16:14.599 --> 16:17.684
I'd be quiet now,
Mr. Tolliver, if I were you.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.899
Losses and indignities which,

16:24.067 --> 16:28.695
despite the strong impulse
of my nature toward simplicity,

16:28.863 --> 16:32.449
prompt me to a different approach.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.453
- Do you enjoy that, sir?
- No, I don't.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.455
- You don't enjoy that?
- I don't, no.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.457
And I wish you'd cut it the fuck out.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.794
I not only spent last night incarcerated,

16:43.961 --> 16:45.796
I was taken to jail by the ear.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.631
That fuckin' maniac sheriff.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.717
By our maniac sheriff,
that's correct.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.135
And had as a cellmate--

16:52.303 --> 16:55.806
or to be fair in describing
my situation,

16:55.973 --> 17:00.018
cohabitated with in the adjacent cell
a rotting corpse,

17:00.186 --> 17:02.688
whom it was the deputy's
pleasure this morning

17:02.855 --> 17:04.772
to accuse me of having murdered.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.693
I'm therefore distressed and angry

17:07.859 --> 17:11.279
and I seem, for the moment,
to be taking this out on your ear!

17:11.446 --> 17:16.242
But in the longer term
my intentions are other

17:16.411 --> 17:19.121
and more complicated.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.915
Can we pretend
the longer term's arrived, sir?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.250
(chuckles)

17:23.417 --> 17:26.336
I'd have you release me,
for a fucking fact.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.672
(laughing)

17:34.595 --> 17:37.806
Sorry.
Temper got the best of me.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.267
Don't give it another thought, sir.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.060
Don't kill her yet.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.606
I took that as your meaning.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.484
Oh, you think you can
shine on me like the sun?

17:49.652 --> 17:51.820
"Oh, Leon, you're a good guy.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.197
You put me next to the bank lady.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.159
You got a great fucking future at my side."

17:57.326 --> 17:59.995
Oh, fuck you. Fuck you!

18:02.540 --> 18:04.916
Don't you think I know
the outcome of that?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.294
Once the bank lady dies
from the overdose,

18:07.462 --> 18:10.130
if you've had a good fucking day,
I get a quick one in the ear.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.923
And of course if the day went bad,

18:12.091 --> 18:14.801
first you carve on me for a fucking while.

18:14.969 --> 18:18.388
Oh! Fuck you, rube!

18:18.556 --> 18:21.850
You clean up? Your 83¢?

18:22.018 --> 18:25.687
Or whatever you froze your balls for
all day in the fucking streams!

18:26.856 --> 18:29.149
Yeah, I'll get off right here if I want to.

18:31.736 --> 18:34.404
Don't confuse me, Mr. T,

18:34.572 --> 18:36.615
with having no cards up my sleeve.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.035
This stalwart
didn't raise no stupid sons.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.622
Or that don't know... how to...

18:43.790 --> 18:46.166
navigate a tight...

18:52.131 --> 18:54.132
Morning, Mrs. Ellsworth.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.971
- Morning.
- Out for a smoke.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.224
Fine, Trixie.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.816
My Celestial ain't in position.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.235
I ain't sure when he will be.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.695
Maybe you need to make
a different arrangement.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.950
I wonder, Leon,
if we don't now approach

19:20.117 --> 19:22.577
a turn in our conversation...

19:22.745 --> 19:24.955
having to do with increasing your fee.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.749
If I was you, lady,
instead of cracking fucking wise

19:27.917 --> 19:30.669
I might be thinking of different ways
of spending my idle time.

19:32.713 --> 19:36.341
I can't help but noticing,
your Celestial's not being in a position

19:36.509 --> 19:38.802
isn't reflected in your condition.

19:38.970 --> 19:42.639
Yeah? I'm high and planning
to stay that way--

19:42.807 --> 19:44.641
not to fucking mention alive.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.936
That's the last you see of me.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.405
(cocks pistol)

19:59.699 --> 20:02.033
Get the fuck out of here!

20:02.201 --> 20:03.827
Leave her the fuck alone!

20:03.995 --> 20:07.289
If you would take that out of my ear,
I would be happy to know what you mean.

20:07.456 --> 20:11.042
I mean, if you keep selling her dope,
I will fucking kill you.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.254
Fine, I agree.
You have shown me the light.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.423
I don't want to see her high again.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.009
Only promise me this,
you meddling cunt,

20:19.176 --> 20:22.679
if you do, before you head out to kill me,
you'll ask her where she got her stuff.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.848
I am no longer the lady's supplier.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.021
May I go?

20:45.453 --> 20:47.120
I know.

20:48.623 --> 20:52.208
- Do you?
- Yes, your ladyship, I do.

20:52.376 --> 20:56.504
And just heard from that shitbag Leon
you've got a new supplier.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.008
You are quite mistaken, Trixie,

21:00.176 --> 21:04.846
and however well intended,
beyond your proper province.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.890
Fuck you, Mrs. Ellsworth.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.809
I am in the process

21:09.977 --> 21:13.563
of making adjustments to the--
complications of my situation.

21:13.731 --> 21:17.817
- Bullshit.
- Do not take over-many liberties.

21:17.985 --> 21:22.030
You've fallen back with
a fucking child in your home.

21:27.203 --> 21:30.705
I will no longer be
requiring your services.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.041
Alack for me.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.544
(sarcastically)
How I'd hoped I could work here forever.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.719
(door slams)

21:44.887 --> 21:46.721
I give up music with my fucking.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.975
I don't need any more friends
than what I got.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.310
(chuckles)
And I give up

21:52.478 --> 21:55.063
clocking that cocksucker upstairs.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.441
An inscrutable figure-- Mr. Hearst.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.902
Now what I want you to know:

22:01.070 --> 22:04.698
his first activities impinging on me
I don't hear about beforehand from you,

22:04.865 --> 22:08.201
- I'm gonna cut your fucking throat.
- Goodness.

22:08.369 --> 22:11.413
You see that 200 I've give you?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.541
I do, yes, at the margin of vision.

22:14.709 --> 22:19.254
That argues there's a better way.

22:19.422 --> 22:20.630
(clears throat)

22:22.174 --> 22:23.925
Take the desk.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.099
Liberia.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.268
He mind me here 'fore his say-so?

22:33.436 --> 22:35.937
How is he gonna mind
you come see your mother?

22:36.105 --> 22:38.106
Here in your room.

22:38.274 --> 22:41.985
He give me this room.
"You stay here, Aunt Lou.

22:42.153 --> 22:45.113
Who says what,
no goddamn never mind to me."

22:45.281 --> 22:46.781
(both laugh)

22:46.949 --> 22:48.491
That's good then.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.410
Well well well.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.496
You've company
in your room, Aunt Lou.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.665
My boy, Mr. Hearst,

22:55.833 --> 22:58.543
- my boy Odell.
- Your boy?

22:58.711 --> 23:02.589
- How do you do, Odell?
- How do you do, sir?

23:02.757 --> 23:05.050
Lou:
Where have you been, Mr. Hearst?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.010
Let me fix you up some breakfast.

23:07.178 --> 23:09.012
You made yourself at home, Odell,

23:09.180 --> 23:11.347
here in the room
I set aside for your mother.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.141
I asked him in, yes, sir.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.685
Yes, sir, that was me asked him in.

23:15.853 --> 23:19.606
Well, now that your mama
has invited you in,

23:19.774 --> 23:22.859
I suppose we might say
on the spur of the moment,

23:23.027 --> 23:26.446
I hope that you'll accept
my invitation as well

23:26.614 --> 23:29.032
as the hotel's owner

23:29.200 --> 23:31.868
and your mother's employer.

23:32.036 --> 23:35.371
Please, Odell, won't you stay?

23:35.539 --> 23:39.793
I will, sir. Thank you.
Thank you for your kindness.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.670
Not hungry just now, Aunt Lou.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.677
Here, Al, is your answer.

23:51.722 --> 23:54.432
Nor would 10 times the sum
have tempted me.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.602
- Should have known.
- You confirm my judgment then--

23:57.770 --> 24:01.898
- you were the money's source.
- As it happens, EB, I was not.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.567
I see.

24:04.735 --> 24:05.860
In that case

24:06.028 --> 24:07.987
you may view my behavior

24:08.155 --> 24:10.323
as a random display of loyalty.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.827
Explaining yourself offers
a better chance of getting it back.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.162
That money, Al, came from Tolliver,

24:16.330 --> 24:18.915
seeking knowledge, as he claimed,

24:19.083 --> 24:21.376
of such of Hearst's activities as I,

24:21.544 --> 24:24.212
operating the man's hotel,
might come into.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.340
How could I not believe it was you

24:27.508 --> 24:30.718
orchestrating the approach
as some form of test?

24:30.886 --> 24:32.929
The alternative would have Tolliver,

24:33.097 --> 24:35.765
knowing my history with you,
believing nonetheless

24:35.933 --> 24:38.059
that he could approach me,

24:38.227 --> 24:42.230
swaying my loyalty as if I had no morals
more than a street whore.

24:43.941 --> 24:47.777
Ain't to Tolliver's standard,
the baldness of it.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.988
My thinking exactly.

24:50.156 --> 24:53.032
The lack of prelude or prologue.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.909
It's Hearst--

24:55.077 --> 24:56.953
Hearst, is he Caesar,

24:57.121 --> 24:59.831
to have fights to the death
for diversion?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.541
Murder his workers at whim?

25:01.709 --> 25:04.085
Smash passages in the fucking wall?

25:04.253 --> 25:07.505
A man of less wealth
would be in fucking restraints.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.049
We're in the presence of the new.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.634
Fuck the fucking new!

25:11.802 --> 25:13.386
Jesus Christ, Al.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.848
- Is it over for us here?
- Go back to the hotel, EB.

25:17.892 --> 25:20.602
Save us.
Think of something.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.396
Have I ever not?

25:23.564 --> 25:26.274
We'll discuss that money another time.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.239
- Sol: There's leaving the camp.
- Seth: No.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.575
No, I--

25:35.743 --> 25:37.702
no.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.665
One thing-- if he knew it was coming,

25:42.833 --> 25:45.043
Bill was not shy of drawing first.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.837
Seth locked up Hearst instead of that.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.089
Oh, I get it.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.051
Wh-what does that mean?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.303
It means, Mr. Star,

25:55.471 --> 26:00.266
after leading him by the ear
through camp for all to fucking see,

26:00.434 --> 26:03.645
Seth installs Hearst in a cell

26:03.812 --> 26:06.522
adjoining a man he's had killed,

26:06.690 --> 26:09.484
that the knife still
protrudes out of his chest.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.445
And much as me
and Hearst conversed,

26:12.613 --> 26:14.572
I made him address my ass.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.450
So do let's don't pretend

26:17.618 --> 26:21.246
Hearst will feel he was treated
legal or-or civilized,

26:21.413 --> 26:24.749
or that his business with us is finished.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.918
Hearst is fucking coming.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.087
Bringing us back to Bill

26:29.255 --> 26:31.673
and doing unto others first.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.758
Which ought maybe include

26:33.926 --> 26:36.094
a visit to Hearst's fucking diggings.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.555
And his muscle you fail
to murder before they arouse?

26:39.723 --> 26:42.183
You bring to chase you to camp--

26:42.351 --> 26:44.477
Judas goat the cocksuckers--

26:44.645 --> 26:48.690
for Swearengen's men and Tolliver's
to mow down from fucking ambush

26:48.857 --> 26:51.025
while we're up seeing to Hearst.

26:51.193 --> 26:53.319
There'll be nothing left of the camp.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.741
How much you figure will stand

26:58.909 --> 27:01.661
once Hearst had his fucking say?

27:07.543 --> 27:09.377
(inhales)

27:24.435 --> 27:27.562
Truth is if I, on Tolliver's instructions,

27:27.730 --> 27:30.398
provide an overdose
Mrs. Ellsworth dies from,

27:30.566 --> 27:32.567
for being able to say he told me to,

27:32.735 --> 27:34.986
who does he fucking croak next?

27:35.154 --> 27:38.323
You are lethally fucking middled.

27:41.285 --> 27:44.704
So she says,
"No no, I want five oxen

27:44.872 --> 27:46.039
and one chicken."

27:46.206 --> 27:48.374
(both laugh)

27:48.542 --> 27:51.419
- Rube fucking humor.
- Mr. Tolliver.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.171
Come with me, Leon.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.673
Let Con calm down.

28:00.721 --> 28:01.929
Hold off.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.932
- Hold off?
- Hold the fuck off.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.684
Don't fucking step up the purity.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.437
Just keep selling her
what you've been fucking selling.

28:09.605 --> 28:13.024
It's a wise man that knows his own limits.
Now go ahead out there, son,

28:13.192 --> 28:14.984
and continue doing wrong.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.153
Yes, sir, Mr. Tolliver.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.367
(door closes)

28:22.534 --> 28:25.453
(groans in pain)
Cocksucker.

28:25.621 --> 28:28.373
- Everything all right?
- Leave me alone!

28:32.753 --> 28:34.295
(whimpers)

28:34.463 --> 28:36.339
Ooh.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.385
I wouldn't mind
turning a fucking trick.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.345
Get the fuck

28:42.513 --> 28:44.847
out of here!

28:45.015 --> 28:47.100
We ain't hiring.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.353
Fuck you anyways, Al, for not
recognizing a figure of speech.

28:50.521 --> 28:54.065
It ain't one you ought to employ,
you stupid bitch.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.235
I made a casual remark,
an off-handed comment.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.321
I wouldn't mind turning
a fucking trick.

29:00.489 --> 29:04.325
Operate out of the back of his store then,
you're so set on lifting your skirts.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.494
Let some fuck filthy from the mines,

29:06.662 --> 29:08.496
breath rotten from his broken teeth,

29:08.664 --> 29:11.666
piss-reeking, shit-stinking
fuck every hole in your body.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.960
What's the matter with you?

29:14.128 --> 29:17.004
I lose patience with cunts
too ignorant to know

29:17.172 --> 29:19.340
when their lot's improved.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.972
- She's using again.
- Who do we speak of now?

29:26.140 --> 29:28.933
The fucking Mrs. Ellsworth.
And I told her I knew

29:29.101 --> 29:32.728
and that she'd ruin her child
and that I quit her stupid job.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.648
If that don't straighten her out,
I don't know fucking what.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.483
What was I supposed to do then?

29:37.651 --> 29:40.403
Look after your fucking self,
you loopy cunt.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.363
Now get the fuck out of here!

29:59.965 --> 30:01.340
Hello.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.634
Hello.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.598
- (Alma sniffs)
- I thought you'd be at the bank.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.184
I came away without something.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.769
You might hurry not to make Sofia tardy.

30:18.066 --> 30:21.611
- Where did you stay?
- At the diggings.

30:23.572 --> 30:25.239
Was Sofia upset?

30:25.407 --> 30:27.116
As you may imagine.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.787
May I appeal to you to reconsider?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.748
I needn't be your husband

30:33.916 --> 30:36.250
to be what father to Sofia I can.

30:36.418 --> 30:39.754
I care for you a great deal.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.641
An arrangement like ours

30:51.808 --> 30:54.227
wouldn't get anymore tolerable to you.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.022
And I couldn't bear it,

30:58.190 --> 31:02.485
seeing what you'd do to yourself.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.614
You'll straighten around if I go.

31:30.180 --> 31:34.475
I can't help noticing in you
just now, Mr. Blazanov, uh--

31:34.643 --> 31:37.645
- I'm sad.
- I see.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.855
I imagine

31:40.023 --> 31:41.816
my murdered parents.

31:41.984 --> 31:43.943
They were killed on their farm

31:44.111 --> 31:46.946
while I was a student in Petersburg.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.907
I imagine their bodies

31:50.075 --> 31:53.035
like the man we found on our walking.

31:53.203 --> 31:56.372
We are swept up,

31:56.540 --> 31:59.542
are we not, by the large events

31:59.710 --> 32:02.044
and forces of our times?

32:02.212 --> 32:04.505
(sighs)

32:04.673 --> 32:07.008
How much they saved...

32:09.177 --> 32:12.179
to send me for study.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.321
I'm gonna go ahead
and try this cobbler.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.282
Don't think I didn't notice
you hadn't tried it yet.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.536
Oh, that's delicious!

32:35.704 --> 32:39.874
And praise God, how fast
the mails must be getting to be.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.048
'Cause it ain't a month since I wrote.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.216
27 days.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.180
I keep track
when I send you my letters

32:54.348 --> 32:56.724
so I know when to hope for one back.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.560
And him sending for me to come here,

32:59.728 --> 33:02.396
it's 27 days since I wrote to tell you that.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.860
And I just can't feature,

33:08.028 --> 33:10.655
Odell, all that way in Liberia,

33:10.822 --> 33:13.282
you could have gotten my letter

33:13.450 --> 33:15.826
that took the time it took to get to you

33:15.994 --> 33:19.330
and then you take passage
to come back here to America,

33:19.498 --> 33:23.250
and got from New York City
to hell and gone out here

33:23.418 --> 33:25.836
all in 27 days.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.756
I can't feature it's possible.

33:28.924 --> 33:32.051
Whoo, praise God, praise God!

33:32.219 --> 33:34.220
Well, Mama,

33:34.388 --> 33:36.806
maybe I set out
without having the letter.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.433
But then you couldn't
have known I was here.

33:39.601 --> 33:42.186
Couldn't have knowed it
proved, you mean.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.855
Would've had to took it on faith,

33:45.023 --> 33:46.816
reading in the newspaper

33:46.983 --> 33:48.943
that he was here in this place,

33:49.111 --> 33:51.320
you would be too.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.489
Decided it was time.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.252
There you are.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.838
- Here we are.
- Odell.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.215
I had thought to find you inside.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.551
I hope you don't take me
for ungrateful.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.969
I have an inkling you're wise, Odell.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.179
I've gotten used to being outdoors,

34:18.348 --> 34:20.141
all that time at the site of the find.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.268
What find do you refer to, son?

34:25.230 --> 34:27.606
Liberia, sir. The gold.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.487
Invite you now
to sit down with him to eat--

34:33.655 --> 34:36.322
"Sit across from me
and have dinner, Odell."

34:36.491 --> 34:38.409
--that before you said gold,

34:38.577 --> 34:42.663
fire's in his eyes you was
anyplace indoors at all.

34:42.831 --> 34:45.331
Gold seemed to change his mind.

34:45.500 --> 34:50.087
Don't you want to say "Yes, ma'am"
or "Yes, Mama" before that or after, Odell,

34:50.255 --> 34:52.840
so my heart feels how sweet you are?

34:53.007 --> 34:55.176
No, ma'am.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.472
Make me know you sweet,

34:59.639 --> 35:02.850
God-fearing and truthful
like I wanted my boy to be.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.478
Back from where you send him,

35:05.645 --> 35:07.813
raising up to a man,

35:07.981 --> 35:10.858
safe amongst his own.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.779
Liberia... free.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.114
Free? Shit.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.033
Don't you speak to me thatta way!

35:19.201 --> 35:22.161
- What way, Mama?
- Use language like that to me!

35:22.329 --> 35:25.831
No kinda truth?
Yes, ma'am.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.792
Liberia free.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.877
Praise Jesus.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.378
Here come the Spirit over me.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.882
Don't you take Him in vain.
Don't you dare to do it!

35:35.050 --> 35:36.258
All right, Mama,

35:36.426 --> 35:38.427
all right.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.723
What was the truth of it then?

35:44.559 --> 35:47.019
Liberia?

35:49.523 --> 35:53.192
No field work--
African niggers for that.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.528
Now they lazy and stupid, Mama.

35:55.695 --> 35:59.073
American niggers steal off the African,

35:59.241 --> 36:01.367
till the English cheat us out of it.

36:01.535 --> 36:04.370
Hot till you can't breathe.

36:04.538 --> 36:07.498
Nothing ever be dry. Hate the air.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.167
Hate the breathing in and out.

36:12.128 --> 36:14.463
Liberia.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.262
Is there gold, Odell?

36:24.349 --> 36:27.226
A rich find, Mama. Rich.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.854
Praise God.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.356
He give His son for our sins

36:32.524 --> 36:35.901
and Mr. Hearst to help us.

36:36.069 --> 36:38.654
Where are you going, boy?

36:38.822 --> 36:41.282
Find a place where
a nigger can have a drink,

36:41.449 --> 36:43.534
before he sits down with Mr. Hearst.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.124
Steve: Putting that dead one's
kidneys up his nose,

36:50.292 --> 36:54.044
however the fuck else
they summon up their demons.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.464
Beat thigh bones on tin pans.

36:57.632 --> 37:01.385
Shake and rattle
and hop the fuck around.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.679
Another?

37:03.847 --> 37:06.348
Am I swine, Harry,

37:06.516 --> 37:10.019
that in an otherwise empty joint

37:10.186 --> 37:13.856
the owner must make
a show of relocating

37:14.024 --> 37:16.400
further away from me?

37:16.568 --> 37:19.987
Maybe it's you being present
keeps away the broader clientele.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.406
And maybe, Tom,

37:22.574 --> 37:26.243
it's the chill in here is what does it,

37:26.411 --> 37:29.163
when every edifice else in camp's

37:29.331 --> 37:32.082
been swanked up and seen to.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.501
Look inward, why don't you?

37:34.669 --> 37:36.712
Instead of always blaming the other.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.138
Welcome to the No. 10.
My name is Tom.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.015
Harry'll take your order.

37:48.183 --> 37:51.185
His name is Steve.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.194
Whiskey.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.947
(coin jingles)

38:06.701 --> 38:08.661
Afternoon.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.126
Where is my dinner companion?

38:16.294 --> 38:18.629
I don't know where that boy's got to, sir.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.548
I guess we all have
different ideas, Aunt Lou,

38:21.716 --> 38:23.842
of what constitutes punctuality.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.053
Guess everybody do
about everything, sir.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.263
Look like more and more that's true.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.308
- Why don't I go find him?
- You don't believe he's forgotten?

38:31.476 --> 38:34.395
I don't know no more, sir.
Let me just get past you.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.272
What if he returns and you're still gone?
Who'll serve dinner?

38:37.440 --> 38:40.693
I'm getting past you
Mr. Hearst, please do excuse.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.242
Where is the livery at?

38:50.412 --> 38:53.539
I'm not assuming you know
left from right,

38:53.707 --> 38:55.416
or I'd have spoken.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.377
Jane: I've never done that
sober in my life.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.754
Pissed yourself?

39:00.922 --> 39:04.508
And if account of the mishap circulates,
I will know the fucking source.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.468
Who could I tell?

39:06.636 --> 39:10.347
I'd have never known it had happened
if you hadn't started screaming about it.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.100
Pissing yourself at the grave
of your best friend

39:13.268 --> 39:15.394
and most admired person
you've ever known,

39:15.562 --> 39:17.855
that ain't cause for fucking dismay?

39:18.023 --> 39:19.481
Bible instructs us

39:19.649 --> 39:22.609
when two of different races
return from a graveyard together,

39:22.777 --> 39:24.570
the event should be marked with liquor.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.865
Lou:
Praise God! Thank you, Jesus.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.700
I come looking for you,

39:29.868 --> 39:33.078
that cooked for you and your friend
as was strangers to me.

39:33.246 --> 39:36.290
- What's your trouble?
- Save my boy, sir,

39:36.458 --> 39:38.500
that's past his mother's help.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.628
- (knocks)
- Al: Yeah.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.640
- How are your spirits, chief?
- All right.

39:53.808 --> 39:57.603
Do not bullshit me, Dan!
The task I'd assign you is pivotal.

39:57.771 --> 40:00.814
- I'm all right.
- And leave the matter at that?

40:00.982 --> 40:03.609
- What the fuck else you want me to say?
- Nothing.

40:03.777 --> 40:07.446
You gave me the basis to decide.
I'm not fucking sending you anywhere.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.615
Well, fuck where
you were gonna send me!

40:09.783 --> 40:12.618
And fuck the task you
were gonna assign me to do!

40:12.786 --> 40:15.621
And that confirms my opinion,
that indifferent rejoinder.

40:15.789 --> 40:18.040
I'm on the verge of striking you
a fucking blow.

40:18.208 --> 40:22.336
Oh, which I would be inclined to absorb as
proof you'd passed the killing of that giant.

40:22.504 --> 40:25.172
Which I have been
waiting to hear you volunteer.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.132
Then why didn't you just
ask me to volunteer it?

40:27.300 --> 40:30.844
Because opinion solicited
does not equal one freely voiced.

40:33.515 --> 40:36.266
This is what I predicted to Johnny,
virtually word for word.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.853
- About what?
- How you'd react to that killing.

40:40.021 --> 40:43.107
"Dan, Johnny, does not like
killing to end a fair fight."

40:43.274 --> 40:47.277
"Oh, why, Al?" asked Johnny. "Because--"
and I fucking have to explain to him,

40:47.445 --> 40:51.865
"--it's more like a contest, Johnny,
or the like, a bout."

40:52.033 --> 40:54.201
Seeing a light go out of their eyes.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.411
In the one you'd left in its socket.

40:59.249 --> 41:02.292
Better in his one
than the both of yours, hmm?

41:04.170 --> 41:07.339
I'd have you go to Cheyenne

41:07.507 --> 41:10.676
to see to the hiring of guns...

41:10.844 --> 41:12.678
All right.

41:12.846 --> 41:15.013
...wishing an alternative
would come to me.

41:15.181 --> 41:18.767
- Want me to go to Bismarck?
- An alternative to the hiring of guns, Dan.

41:18.935 --> 41:22.771
Yeah, Hearst's pockets
are bigger than ours.

41:22.939 --> 41:26.400
Being neighbor to his prick,
which Bullock may as well have belittled

41:26.568 --> 41:29.069
when grabbing him by his fucking ear.

41:40.665 --> 41:44.585
Do you feature the Nigger General
getting my boy to take that money?

41:45.587 --> 41:48.463
No man better for the task.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.550
That little Nigger General has a gift.

41:51.718 --> 41:54.469
Gets you to an attitude he'd have you

41:54.637 --> 41:56.513
and goes about his business.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.765
Leaves you to stand in wonderment.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.977
"What happened to change my mood?"

42:02.145 --> 42:05.189
or change my opinion or decision,

42:05.356 --> 42:08.942
take money maybe
I never featured I would,

42:09.110 --> 42:12.321
come fire or flood or the like.

42:15.450 --> 42:18.952
That's the little Nigger General all over.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.871
I pray Jesus you're right.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.873
Oh, having no pull in that quarter,

42:23.041 --> 42:26.335
I'm tolerable confident I am.

42:26.502 --> 42:29.463
Could I have a swig?

42:29.631 --> 42:32.633
Now that is the first giant step

42:32.800 --> 42:36.345
towards long-term
understanding and friendship.

42:36.512 --> 42:39.223
Do not employ a mug

42:39.390 --> 42:43.060
lest next we'd be
donning white gloves.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.979
All right then.

42:50.693 --> 42:54.029
- (clears throat) Yes yes yes.
- (Jane laughs)

42:55.573 --> 42:58.992
Yeah, there's a new house policy
now at the No. 10 Saloon:

42:59.160 --> 43:03.830
anyone at all can drink
or move in and take up residence,

43:03.998 --> 43:06.124
for all the fuck the policy cares.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.713
Ain't meaning to be here long.
Ain't looking to drink.

43:11.881 --> 43:14.383
All's I'm here for, Steve,

43:14.550 --> 43:16.468
is to talk to this here gentleman.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.470
Go ahead and do somersaults

43:18.638 --> 43:22.182
or peel bananas with each other
for all I give a fuck.

43:22.350 --> 43:24.309
The whole place
has gone to shit anyhow.

43:24.477 --> 43:27.521
- What could we have to talk about?
- Your mama did me a kindness

43:27.689 --> 43:29.606
and she asked me to talk to you.

43:29.774 --> 43:32.901
I guess I also got to tell you
that she give me $742

43:33.069 --> 43:36.363
to give to you if you just
get the hell out of camp.

43:38.199 --> 43:40.993
- What's your name?
- Nigger General Samuel Fields.

43:42.829 --> 43:46.665
Now my plan-- I got 1200 left
to me by a tall nigger

43:46.833 --> 43:49.835
who, after he sold
his fucking livery to Steve there,

43:50.003 --> 43:51.878
blew his fucking head off--

43:52.046 --> 43:55.966
past that $742 in my pocket
that I'm trying to give you,

43:56.134 --> 43:59.094
my plan is get to San Francisco,

43:59.262 --> 44:02.180
buy enough white pussy
to stretch from the harbor

44:02.348 --> 44:04.725
to the closest rooming house
that'll have me

44:04.892 --> 44:08.186
and then fuck my way
to the Pacific Ocean.

44:14.485 --> 44:16.987
She said that she sent you away.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.448
Mmm, not far.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.742
- Fucking Africa.
- Damn.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.578
- What'd you say made her mad?
- Called her Mama.

44:24.746 --> 44:28.665
So now you want to run
a little something on her boss,

44:28.833 --> 44:31.209
which would be a waste
of that high yellow skin, Odell.

44:31.377 --> 44:33.879
We done talking, Samuel.

44:41.763 --> 44:44.014
All yours.

45:03.743 --> 45:07.037
The nigger I appointed
to dine with does not appear.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.581
As well,

45:09.749 --> 45:12.751
since his mother's
not here to serve us.

45:15.338 --> 45:19.049
- What do you know of last night?
- My stomach hurt.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.927
Hearst:
I was discomfited otherwise.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.723
Stupid, aren't you?

45:26.891 --> 45:28.767
Yes, sir.

45:33.981 --> 45:36.566
Better than what
some of these others are.

45:40.488 --> 45:44.991
This place displeases me.
I'm taking measures to bring it down.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.661
Richardson: All right.

45:53.167 --> 45:56.420
Does he speak of the hotel?

45:56.587 --> 45:58.463
Or even more?

46:06.431 --> 46:08.432
That they're armed and awake

46:08.599 --> 46:10.767
don't have to mean
they're fucking hired.

46:10.935 --> 46:14.312
Yeah, and when I feel a shit coming on
I'll remember to drop my pants.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.648
The obvious merits utterance.

46:16.816 --> 46:19.234
Character is fucking pertinent.

46:19.402 --> 46:22.529
If I'm to go, I'd as soon get
started before the darkness.

46:22.697 --> 46:24.781
Going means
the darkness is upon us.

46:26.868 --> 46:28.869
(clears throat)

46:30.121 --> 46:31.955
Bullock.

46:34.333 --> 46:36.543
Could him and me talk?

46:38.379 --> 46:41.465
Sure.
Converse amongst yourselves.

46:45.928 --> 46:48.346
Charlie Utter thinks it has
to come to blood.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.557
Charlie Utter's likely right.

46:50.725 --> 46:53.643
And if it has to,
that we should strike first.

46:56.731 --> 46:59.983
Believe me, even now

47:00.151 --> 47:03.737
in the forest, the blade would be
between my teeth,

47:03.905 --> 47:07.073
me and you making our way
stealthily forward.

47:11.704 --> 47:15.040
And as to us and him,

47:15.208 --> 47:18.543
if blood's what it finally comes to,
100 years from now

47:18.711 --> 47:21.796
the forest is what they'll find here.

47:22.798 --> 47:25.050
Dewy morning's lost
its appeal for me.

47:26.928 --> 47:30.180
I prefer to wake indoors.

47:30.348 --> 47:33.850
Dan!
You don't travel tonight.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.980
Come. In need of
canned peaches, Johnny.

47:39.148 --> 47:42.025
Let's collect the camp elders.

47:42.193 --> 47:45.028
Be baffled among friends, huh?

47:48.241 --> 47:50.450
I tried, Miss Lady.

47:55.164 --> 47:57.040
No.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.167
No no.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.759
Gentlemen.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.929
Mr. Hearst.

48:13.766 --> 48:15.392
Odell!

48:17.311 --> 48:19.437
Odell!

48:19.605 --> 48:21.731
Odell:
Hello, Mr. Hearst.

48:21.899 --> 48:25.151
- Who's the new nigger?
- Fucking late, son.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.529
Awful sorry, sir.

48:27.697 --> 48:30.991
- Your mama's tardy as well.
- Is that so?

48:31.158 --> 48:34.286
That's all right,
we'll await her speaking of gold.

48:34.453 --> 48:36.204
Oh, that'd be just wonderful, sir.

48:36.372 --> 48:39.291
- How's the finger?
- All right, Mr. Hearst.

48:41.002 --> 48:43.378
How's the fucking ear?

48:45.089 --> 48:47.173
Good, Bullock, good.

48:47.341 --> 48:51.678
By dissembling our feelings
we keep the strategic edge.

48:57.810 --> 49:01.062
You don't get him.
You don't take him from me.

49:01.230 --> 49:04.858
Oh no. You don't get him.
You don't take him from me.

49:05.026 --> 49:08.153
Not quick, but she does
seem full of purpose.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.995
People are fucking people,

49:17.163 --> 49:19.414
and that is fucked up!

49:21.667 --> 49:24.711
You don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about,

49:24.879 --> 49:26.546
'cause you don't know people.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.882
I...

49:29.050 --> 49:30.467
I know people

49:30.635 --> 49:33.053
and I know the way
they fucking operate.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.930
Who are you talking to, Jane?

49:36.098 --> 49:38.475
What business
or concern is that of yours?

49:38.643 --> 49:40.727
I wondered where you were.

49:40.895 --> 49:44.314
I'd hoped you come stay with me
instead of going back to all this.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.858
Whatever you mean by this,

49:47.026 --> 49:50.153
I have been recently engaged

49:50.321 --> 49:53.990
in complicated
negotiations with niggers...

49:54.158 --> 49:57.118
who equal any other
creature walking upright

49:57.286 --> 50:00.664
being able to fuck themselves up.

50:01.666 --> 50:04.751
I got myself a room at Shaunessey's.

50:04.919 --> 50:08.880
The offer still stands, Jane. I'd really
like it if you'd come stay with me.

50:09.048 --> 50:12.008
I am a creature of habit and routine.

50:12.176 --> 50:15.095
And I am a creature
of difficulty falling asleep.

50:15.262 --> 50:17.722
If I don't mind
pissing myself to stay asleep,

50:17.890 --> 50:19.432
I'm not likely to destroy

50:19.600 --> 50:22.936
a habit of routine sleeping
someplace completely elsewhere.

50:23.104 --> 50:26.398
- Come on, Jane, we're going.
- You ain't got the fucking manpower

50:26.565 --> 50:28.316
- to pull my ass up.
- Come on.

50:28.484 --> 50:30.485
You're putting yourself

50:30.653 --> 50:32.237
very much in danger, my friend.

50:32.405 --> 50:34.656
(Jane sniffling)

50:34.824 --> 50:36.282
Very very very

50:36.450 --> 50:39.327
very very very much in danger.

50:41.914 --> 50:43.540
(retches)

50:43.708 --> 50:46.042
That's all right, Jane.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.294
Come on.
