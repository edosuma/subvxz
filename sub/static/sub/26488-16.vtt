WEBVTT

00:08.233 --> 00:09.602
Executing alpha pattern.

00:09.603 --> 00:13.203
Heading 236.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.119
Operational.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.954
ETA to eyewall 30 seconds.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.956
Roger, Teal-79.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.225
ATC clears Teal-79 operational.

00:24.249 --> 00:26.250
Squawk 20000.

00:27.419 --> 00:29.088
Relax.

00:29.089 --> 00:31.128
This ain't our first cat five.

00:31.129 --> 00:33.931
Yeah, but they don't make them
like they used to.

00:34.933 --> 00:36.544
We have good transmit.

00:36.568 --> 00:38.546
Report status.

00:38.570 --> 00:41.382
Tropopause wind speed 210.
LCLs scraping bottom.

00:41.406 --> 00:43.217
Air pressure...

00:43.241 --> 00:45.019
That can't be right.

00:45.043 --> 00:47.054
Holy crap.

00:47.078 --> 00:49.523
Major, flash traffic to NOAA.

00:49.547 --> 00:51.582
They are not gonna like this.

00:57.489 --> 00:59.934
J'accuse.

00:59.958 --> 01:01.402
Good morning.

01:01.426 --> 01:05.206
Basement nachos.
Stairwell crackers. Den cookies.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.440
I deny all.

01:06.464 --> 01:08.309
Ooh, is that a wet/dry vac?

01:08.333 --> 01:10.367
Latest model.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.386
- For the record, the nachos were me.
- Oh.

01:18.410 --> 01:21.522
Still, you better be apartment
hunting, Cookie Monster.

01:21.546 --> 01:24.014
Hunting, yes. Finding, no.

01:25.016 --> 01:26.294
Oh, wait, here's something.

01:26.318 --> 01:28.062
"Co-living creative Eco-space

01:28.086 --> 01:30.231
with adult playroom."

01:30.255 --> 01:31.599
Translation?

01:31.623 --> 01:32.667
He's too old to live there.

01:32.691 --> 01:34.101
Ouch, but true.

01:34.125 --> 01:36.570
- Hey.
- Where's the coffee?

01:36.594 --> 01:38.973
- Whoops.
- Good morning, sunshine.

01:38.997 --> 01:41.242
- Sorry, government business.
- Come on.

01:41.266 --> 01:43.444
Oh, God, work is a mess today.

01:43.468 --> 01:44.369
What's up?

01:44.370 --> 01:48.949
Super Typhoon Blessing has
record low pressure at sea level

01:48.973 --> 01:51.552
and is now the most powerful
storm in recorded history.

01:51.576 --> 01:52.887
We're just gonna whistle past

01:52.911 --> 01:54.155
the irony of the name, huh?

01:54.179 --> 01:55.690
The cone of expectancy

01:55.714 --> 01:57.325
puts it on course for U.S. territory

01:57.349 --> 01:58.559
in the Marshall Islands.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.762
I have to prep meetings
for NOAA, FEMA, DoD...

02:01.786 --> 02:04.799
It's the same story at State.
I've got OFDA

02:04.823 --> 02:07.201
and USAID in overdrive.

02:07.225 --> 02:09.904
Whoa, acronym fight. Come
on, babe, we got to go.

02:09.928 --> 02:11.038
- Yeah.
- Ooh, can I get a ride?

02:11.062 --> 02:12.606
No, uh, we have a meeting
this morning.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.108
- Not at the White House?
- Ooh.

02:14.132 --> 02:15.443
- The plot thickens.
- No, it's a campaign meeting

02:15.467 --> 02:16.711
- with Mike B.
- Ooh.

02:16.735 --> 02:18.979
Cone of silence. Bye.

02:19.003 --> 02:21.371
Goodbye.

02:22.374 --> 02:24.352
The merry McCords.

02:24.376 --> 02:25.386
- All hail.
- Hey, Mike.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.387
Gordon.

02:26.411 --> 02:28.856
Ooh! Look at that sporty coat.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.571
It's a tactical anxiety vest.

02:30.572 --> 02:33.461
He hasn't been the same since
a calico moved in next door.

02:33.485 --> 02:34.504
Button-nosed little monster.

02:34.505 --> 02:36.305
He's probably out
murdering birds as we speak.

02:36.306 --> 02:38.899
- Calicos are actually female.
- Whatever. The point is,

02:38.923 --> 02:40.334
cats are the worst,
and no one should have them.

02:40.358 --> 02:41.702
Now, to brass tacks.

02:41.726 --> 02:44.105
I set up an appointment for
you at the White House

02:44.129 --> 02:46.040
- with Pastor Eli Bragg.
- Eli Bragg.

02:46.064 --> 02:48.075
- Of the Christian Redeemers Network?
- Mm-hmm.

02:48.099 --> 02:50.111
It's an advocacy group
for conservative evangelicals.

02:50.135 --> 02:51.846
Yeah, I'm aware.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.681
Pretty extreme.

02:53.705 --> 02:55.449
Let's call them "traditional."

02:55.473 --> 02:58.452
And Pastor Bragg is a big
player in national politics.

02:58.476 --> 03:00.488
His voters vote, and
his donors donate,

03:00.512 --> 03:02.857
which is more than I can say for
your kombacha-sipping fanboy.

03:02.881 --> 03:03.958
It's kombucha.

03:03.982 --> 03:05.857
- "Kambucha."
- What... So, where do I come in?

03:05.858 --> 03:07.962
CRN is having their
annual conference tomorrow,

03:07.986 --> 03:09.887
and if you impress the good pastor...

03:11.256 --> 03:13.234
...there may be a speaking slot

03:13.258 --> 03:15.302
for America's
favorite religious scholar.

03:15.326 --> 03:16.670
I'll hold for applause.

03:16.694 --> 03:18.139
Has Russell signed off on this?

03:18.163 --> 03:20.107
- Please, what's not to love?
- Let's start

03:20.131 --> 03:22.243
with 90% of their political positions.

03:22.267 --> 03:24.211
Health care, climate change,

03:24.235 --> 03:25.932
those detentions at the border.

03:25.933 --> 03:27.782
I'm sorry, what's your...
what's your brand again?

03:27.806 --> 03:30.584
"Hey, it's the nice lady
with the glasses."

03:30.608 --> 03:33.187
Diplomacy. Willingness
to find common ground.

03:33.211 --> 03:34.955
Sure, Pastor Bragg will probably never

03:34.979 --> 03:36.791
support you, but if Henry

03:36.815 --> 03:39.894
can cozy up and show him
you're not the enemy,

03:39.918 --> 03:42.696
maybe we can keep him
from publicly opposing you.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.365
Well, I'm feeling inspired.

03:44.389 --> 03:46.901
This is exactly the kind
of outreach we need

03:46.925 --> 03:48.302
from Henry during the campaign.

03:48.326 --> 03:49.737
I don't know about the campaign,

03:49.761 --> 03:51.105
but I'll sit down with him.

03:51.129 --> 03:53.874
I believe in the power
of scripture to unite people.

03:53.898 --> 03:56.010
Most wars notwithstanding.

03:56.034 --> 03:57.211
- I knew you were gonna say that.
- Hallelujah.

03:57.235 --> 03:58.245
He's so easy.

03:58.269 --> 04:00.381
Why do I even...

04:00.405 --> 04:02.249
I mean, have you seen
these FEMA numbers?

04:02.273 --> 04:04.452
250-mile-an-hour winds

04:04.476 --> 04:07.822
are gonna destroy 95%
of single-family dwellings

04:07.846 --> 04:10.024
with the force of 20,000 Hiroshimas.

04:10.048 --> 04:12.521
Not to mention the storm surge,
which is over 40 feet.

04:12.522 --> 04:14.957
The highest point
on the Marshalls is 30 feet.

04:14.958 --> 04:16.997
And there's more than 50,000 people.

04:17.021 --> 04:19.733
Hey, you can pack it
up. Meeting's off.

04:19.757 --> 04:22.736
Latest tracking from NOAA has
Blessing making a hard swerve

04:22.760 --> 04:25.206
away from the Marshalls,
so Uncle Sam will get a soaking

04:25.230 --> 04:27.242
- but nothing worse.
- So no landfall?

04:27.243 --> 04:30.211
Looks like it's headed
for the Republic of Nauru.

04:30.235 --> 04:32.202
It's your mother's problem now.

04:34.506 --> 04:37.209
Nauru's taking a direct hit.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.353
Communication with the
government is still down.

04:39.377 --> 04:41.322
Who's our point of contact?

04:41.346 --> 04:43.924
Best we got is a guy named David Akua.

04:43.948 --> 04:46.694
Part-time consular official
at the U.N. in New York.

04:46.718 --> 04:48.629
He's on his way down now.

04:48.653 --> 04:50.397
All right, well...

04:50.421 --> 04:53.734
get with OFDA and pivot aid to Nauru.

04:53.758 --> 04:56.770
And you got to open
a channel with DoD.

04:56.794 --> 04:58.105
We're gonna need Pacific Command

04:58.129 --> 05:00.441
to coordinate an airlift from Guam.

05:00.465 --> 05:01.876
Daisy, Matt,

05:01.900 --> 05:03.377
I need a statement ASAP.

05:03.401 --> 05:04.745
Uh...

05:04.769 --> 05:06.647
- support and sympathy?
- As opposed to fire and brimstone?

05:06.671 --> 05:08.249
Yeah, and also, let's do

05:08.273 --> 05:10.251
a donations hotline.
Get it up within the hour.

05:10.275 --> 05:11.452
Yes, ma'am.

05:11.476 --> 05:13.364
- What else you got?
- Working lunch with PolMil.

05:13.365 --> 05:15.623
And did you hear the news
about Ashley Whittaker?

05:15.647 --> 05:17.324
- What? Oh, my God, no. I love her.
- No.

05:17.348 --> 05:18.893
She's dating Bryce Manley.

05:18.917 --> 05:20.294
- Is this really State business?
- What?

05:20.318 --> 05:21.862
Wait a minute. I'm sorry, I
thought she was with Zac Efron.

05:21.886 --> 05:22.880
As if he could compete with the star

05:22.881 --> 05:24.164
of the Swashbucklers franchise.

05:24.188 --> 05:26.800
She's a former
goodwill ambassador, so...

05:26.824 --> 05:29.054
Uh, also, she helped us out
of a big jam in Kazakhstan.

05:29.055 --> 05:31.293
That doesn't give gossip
a free pass. I object.

05:31.294 --> 05:32.506
- Overruled.
- Gossip? It's-it's like the...

05:32.530 --> 05:33.641
Right! My bad.

05:33.665 --> 05:35.276
Administrator.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.111
- Oh, no, Glenn. Please call me Glenn.
- Oh, Glenn.

05:37.135 --> 05:39.446
Yes. I-I'm sorry,
I wasn't expecting you.

05:39.470 --> 05:41.949
Right. The NASA administrator is here.

05:41.973 --> 05:43.284
He says it's urgent.

05:43.308 --> 05:47.021
Uh, are your people on Nauru okay?

05:47.045 --> 05:48.556
Well, the astronomers are fine,

05:48.580 --> 05:51.926
but the Gimbal-Solander
telescope's a total loss.

05:51.950 --> 05:54.395
Ah. Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:54.419 --> 05:55.563
Yeah, so am I.

05:55.587 --> 05:57.888
But that's not why I'm here.

05:58.890 --> 06:01.368
Typhoon Blessing is a freak.

06:01.392 --> 06:02.770
It's the most powerful ever,

06:02.794 --> 06:06.040
two months before the official
start of typhoon season.

06:06.064 --> 06:08.776
Set off alarm bells within
the scientific community,

06:08.800 --> 06:10.033
so we went looking.

06:11.035 --> 06:14.014
This was taken
above the monsoon trough

06:14.038 --> 06:16.417
by our new GOES-18 satellite.

06:16.441 --> 06:18.052
Maps are like rashes.

06:18.076 --> 06:20.521
If it's big, if it's red,
it's probably bad.

06:20.545 --> 06:21.689
Yeah, I'm getting hives

06:21.713 --> 06:22.790
just looking at it.

06:22.814 --> 06:23.857
Here's a patch

06:23.881 --> 06:25.225
of superheated ocean.

06:25.249 --> 06:27.127
Rising temperatures are outpacing

06:27.151 --> 06:30.331
even our worst-case models,
so tropical cyclogenesis

06:30.355 --> 06:32.637
is gonna get more frequent,
more destructive.

06:32.638 --> 06:34.902
So Blessing isn't a freak.
It's the new normal.

06:34.926 --> 06:36.604
Well, there was a time

06:36.628 --> 06:39.206
when we couldn't link specific
storms to climate change,

06:39.230 --> 06:41.442
but that time has passed.

06:41.466 --> 06:43.900
Which brings us to Nauru.

06:46.671 --> 06:48.240
The survivors need to leave now.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.250
- You mean until they rebuild?
- No, no.

06:50.274 --> 06:51.785
I mean permanently.

06:51.809 --> 06:54.154
All right, hang on, hang on.

06:54.178 --> 06:56.790
Y-You want an entire people
to just pack up and leave?

06:56.814 --> 06:58.626
Walls, dykes, levees.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.629
We have ways
of fighting rising sea levels.

07:01.653 --> 07:02.663
Well, with bedrock, maybe.

07:02.687 --> 07:05.699
But this island's built on soft coral.

07:05.723 --> 07:08.736
Another high-frequency
wave event could be...

07:08.760 --> 07:10.337
Devastating.

07:10.361 --> 07:11.939
Yeah.

07:11.963 --> 07:15.643
It's like a tsunami
hitting a sandcastle.

07:15.667 --> 07:16.977
And given the data,

07:17.001 --> 07:18.445
the odds of that happening
in the near future

07:18.469 --> 07:20.447
are too high for comfort.

07:20.471 --> 07:22.449
Well...

07:22.473 --> 07:24.785
thanks for the pep talk.

07:24.809 --> 07:26.620
It's about to get peppier.

07:26.644 --> 07:30.090
Our Research and Analysis Unit
ran some simulations.

07:30.114 --> 07:31.592
Today it's Nauru.

07:31.616 --> 07:33.394
Tomorrow could easily be Jakarta,

07:33.418 --> 07:35.462
a sinking city

07:35.486 --> 07:37.097
of ten million people.

07:37.121 --> 07:39.299
- You brief POTUS yet?
- That's my next stop.

07:39.323 --> 07:42.002
But since most of these
disasters cover foreign policy,

07:42.026 --> 07:43.804
- I thought you should be prepared.
- Yeah.

07:43.828 --> 07:45.862
- Well, I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

07:46.864 --> 07:48.208
Hey, hey.

07:48.232 --> 07:49.943
You keep up with Nadine?

07:49.967 --> 07:51.612
Now and again.

07:51.636 --> 07:53.247
Yeah, give her my best, will you?

07:53.271 --> 07:55.315
I will.

07:59.077 --> 08:01.255
Any update?

08:01.279 --> 08:04.625
Uh, yes. We just established a
comms link with Nauru via NASA.

08:04.649 --> 08:08.595
Um, the casualties are
even worse than expected.

08:08.619 --> 08:10.664
President Yispinza
was killed in the storm,

08:10.688 --> 08:13.333
as well as all 19 members

08:13.357 --> 08:15.102
of the Nauruan parliament.

08:15.126 --> 08:17.271
How's that even possible?

08:17.295 --> 08:19.373
Parliament House flooded before
they could seek higher ground.

08:19.397 --> 08:22.409
Our best guess is
over a thousand dead.

08:22.433 --> 08:24.878
Uh... hundreds more missing.

08:24.902 --> 08:27.938
That's ten percent of the population.

08:29.907 --> 08:31.618
Okay, let's, um...

08:31.642 --> 08:35.022
let's activate the Overseas
Contingency fund, and...

08:35.046 --> 08:36.823
So, who's in charge?

08:36.847 --> 08:40.094
A-According to their
constitution, David Akua.

08:40.118 --> 08:42.162
The consular official?

08:42.186 --> 08:44.431
Part-time official. He's 23.

08:44.455 --> 08:46.834
He's also pursuing a master's
in public health at NYU.

08:46.858 --> 08:48.435
He came to a, uh...

08:48.459 --> 08:50.037
assistants' mixer at UNGA.

08:50.061 --> 08:51.805
And now he's president.

08:51.829 --> 08:53.373
And here's the kicker.

08:53.397 --> 08:54.908
I don't think he knows.

08:54.932 --> 08:56.210
Ma'am.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.312
Mr. Akua has just arrived.

08:58.336 --> 09:00.403
Mr. Akua.

09:01.405 --> 09:03.350
- Madam Secretary.
- Yes.

09:03.374 --> 09:06.320
Uh, I'm... I was expecting
to see Ms. Zimmer

09:06.344 --> 09:08.522
- from the Office of, uh, Disaster...
- I know.

09:08.546 --> 09:11.091
Um, but I need to speak
with you directly.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.127
- Please have a seat.
- Of course.

09:13.151 --> 09:14.728
I-I don't want to waste your time.

09:14.752 --> 09:16.029
I-I know you're busy.

09:16.053 --> 09:18.699
Uh, I don't even have
my instructions yet

09:18.723 --> 09:20.334
with all the comms still down.

09:20.358 --> 09:23.470
So, what's the last thing you heard?

09:23.494 --> 09:26.373
A WhatsApp from my mother
ab-about the flooding,

09:26.397 --> 09:29.076
but, I mean, that was
before things got bad.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.377
Do you have news?

09:30.401 --> 09:33.046
- Mr. Akua...
- Please, call me David.

09:33.070 --> 09:35.105
David.

09:36.908 --> 09:38.642
What is it?

09:43.677 --> 09:49.303
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

09:49.879 --> 09:51.480
But I work in consular affairs.

09:51.481 --> 09:53.872
I only took this job
to help pay for grad school.

09:53.873 --> 09:55.942
We're gonna get you
on a flight to Hawaii

09:55.943 --> 09:57.354
that leaves in a few hours.

09:57.378 --> 09:59.846
From there, a military plane
will take you on to Nauru.

10:01.382 --> 10:04.284
I know you didn't ask to be president.

10:05.286 --> 10:07.197
My mum. I can barely breathe

10:07.221 --> 10:08.632
'cause I don't know if
she's alive or dead,

10:08.656 --> 10:10.167
- and you're telling me...
- We're doing everything in our power

10:10.191 --> 10:11.868
- to find her. - You mean, I'm
supposed to take care of everyone?

10:11.892 --> 10:14.271
To help them rebuild?

10:14.295 --> 10:16.573
I'm afraid rebuilding isn't an option.

10:16.597 --> 10:19.075
What are you talking about?

10:19.099 --> 10:21.578
According to our best information,

10:21.602 --> 10:24.181
the island of Nauru
is no longer habitable.

10:24.205 --> 10:27.184
You have to evacuate.

10:27.208 --> 10:28.585
I'm sorry.

10:28.609 --> 10:29.853
Evacuate?

10:29.877 --> 10:32.656
You spent $100 billion
rebuilding New Orleans.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.891
I mean, if China can
conjure whole islands

10:34.915 --> 10:37.027
in the Spratlys, I'm sure
we can manage a seawall.

10:37.051 --> 10:39.196
- It's not that simple.
- It should be.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.198
Nauru wouldn't be in this mess
if not for the U.S. spewing

10:41.222 --> 10:44.267
massive amounts of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.036
You owe us.

10:46.060 --> 10:47.037
I know.

10:47.061 --> 10:49.796
But we are past
the point of no return.

10:51.565 --> 10:55.145
Relocation is
the only assistance I can offer.

10:55.169 --> 10:59.216
Nauru has been home to
my people for 3,000 years.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.552
We speak a language shared
by no one else on Earth.

11:02.576 --> 11:04.321
We will never leave.

11:04.345 --> 11:06.156
At the cost of your lives?

11:06.180 --> 11:07.157
Yes.

11:07.181 --> 11:09.192
Now, if you'll excuse me,

11:09.216 --> 11:11.984
apparently I have a plane to catch.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:20.194 --> 11:21.238
Please tell me

11:21.262 --> 11:23.206
they found his mother.

11:23.230 --> 11:24.374
She's alive.

11:24.398 --> 11:26.076
Took shelter in time.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.079
When he gets home,
he'll see things differently.

11:29.103 --> 11:31.348
Kind of counting on it.

11:31.372 --> 11:34.351
I have my team looking into

11:34.375 --> 11:36.353
relocation, but...

11:37.544 --> 11:40.523
...finding a single country
to absorb the whole

11:40.547 --> 11:41.925
Nauru population?

11:41.949 --> 11:43.660
Tall order.

11:43.684 --> 11:46.997
Especially in today's
anti-refugee climate.

11:47.021 --> 11:48.565
No pun intended.

11:48.589 --> 11:51.368
I mean, that poor kid.

11:51.392 --> 11:53.903
He's the same age as Ashley Whittaker.

11:53.927 --> 11:55.872
Kind of puts the whole
thing in perspective.

11:55.896 --> 11:56.873
Who's Ashley Whittaker?

11:56.897 --> 11:58.875
Seriously?

11:58.899 --> 12:01.411
Come on, the actress.

12:01.435 --> 12:03.079
Tally Rides Again.

12:03.103 --> 12:04.848
The Chronicles

12:04.872 --> 12:07.117
of Ashkenar.

12:07.141 --> 12:08.618
"Tonight we dream,

12:08.642 --> 12:10.053
tomorrow we slay."

12:10.077 --> 12:12.055
Wait a minute, I read about this.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.858
She's, uh, dating
the Swashbuckler guy.

12:14.882 --> 12:15.992
Bryce Manley.

12:16.016 --> 12:17.127
You read about it?

12:17.151 --> 12:19.796
It was on Alison's Insta feed.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.531
I... look, I hardly ever understand

12:21.555 --> 12:23.700
what she's talking about,
but I get the gist.

12:23.724 --> 12:25.368
He's twice her age, people are upset,

12:25.392 --> 12:27.037
and other people are upset
that people are upset.

12:27.061 --> 12:30.407
It's the foundation
for all major conflict.

12:30.431 --> 12:32.075
Look, ca-can I help you?

12:32.099 --> 12:34.010
Where is it?

12:34.034 --> 12:35.612
The emergency chocolate.

12:35.636 --> 12:37.147
Come on.

12:37.171 --> 12:38.415
In a secure location.

12:38.439 --> 12:41.541
You just want to save it
for seductions.

12:46.146 --> 12:49.125
You know, the truth is,
he's kind of right.

12:49.149 --> 12:50.727
Who, Akua?

12:50.751 --> 12:53.663
It is the fault of the United States

12:53.687 --> 12:55.999
and the other major carbon producers.

12:56.023 --> 12:58.668
At least, indirectly.

12:58.692 --> 13:00.337
But the question is,

13:00.361 --> 13:01.438
what do I do about it?

13:01.462 --> 13:04.040
Well, it's a twofold imperative.

13:04.064 --> 13:06.176
There's a moral responsibility, yes.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.178
There's a practical one, too.

13:08.202 --> 13:10.013
Yeah. You know, according

13:10.037 --> 13:11.014
to Glenn,

13:11.038 --> 13:13.416
this disaster in Nauru

13:13.440 --> 13:15.885
is just the tip of the iceberg.

13:15.909 --> 13:18.621
Future generations might not
even get that reference.

13:18.645 --> 13:21.358
That's depressing.

13:21.382 --> 13:23.760
There has to be a way

13:23.784 --> 13:27.630
to tackle this more globally.

13:27.654 --> 13:31.701
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have
to... stew on this for a while.

13:31.725 --> 13:33.370
I totally get it.

13:33.394 --> 13:35.705
But you know what?

13:35.729 --> 13:37.707
You're kind of sexy when you stew.

13:42.236 --> 13:44.270
Oh, come on.

13:46.573 --> 13:48.107
Mmm...

13:52.179 --> 13:53.323
Talk to me.

13:53.347 --> 13:56.326
Uh, so far, Fiji,
Tuvalu, New Guinea...

13:56.350 --> 13:58.661
they're all willing to
absorb refugees from Nauru.

13:58.685 --> 13:59.863
You'd have to split them up.

13:59.887 --> 14:01.131
No way Akua goes for that.

14:01.155 --> 14:02.665
Yeah, will he go for any of it?

14:02.689 --> 14:03.833
'Cause, last I heard,

14:03.857 --> 14:05.932
he was refusing
to give the order to evacuate.

14:05.933 --> 14:07.070
The secretary sent him
the NASA report.

14:07.094 --> 14:08.204
We're hoping that moves the needle.

14:08.228 --> 14:09.205
What about Australia?

14:09.229 --> 14:10.206
Declined.

14:10.230 --> 14:12.031
They're chockers, apparently.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.544
That means "full."

14:14.568 --> 14:15.945
Then say "full." Keep pushing.

14:15.969 --> 14:18.014
Meantime, we've got our marching
orders... the secretary

14:18.038 --> 14:19.549
wants us to examine the possibility

14:19.573 --> 14:21.951
of a reparations fund
for developing countries

14:21.975 --> 14:24.421
suffering the consequences
of global warming.

14:24.445 --> 14:25.889
Sounds familiar.

14:25.913 --> 14:28.691
The idea's been floating around
policy circles for a while.

14:28.715 --> 14:31.194
Major carbon polluting
nations, like us,

14:31.218 --> 14:33.263
provide money to protect

14:33.287 --> 14:35.398
or relocate
the more vulnerable populations.

14:35.422 --> 14:37.734
It was debated at the Stockholm
Protocol, and no one gave it

14:37.758 --> 14:40.003
the time of day. But that was
before Super Typhoon Blessing.

14:40.027 --> 14:41.471
So this could be our moment.

14:41.495 --> 14:43.873
Don't count on it. Trust me,
nothing makes rich people

14:43.897 --> 14:46.209
run for the hills faster
than the word "reparations."

14:46.233 --> 14:47.544
You know, that's a good point.

14:47.568 --> 14:49.345
Maybe we should call it
the Resiliency Fund.

14:49.369 --> 14:50.980
Hides the ball, doesn't lie.

14:51.004 --> 14:52.081
I like it.

14:52.105 --> 14:54.083
Reach out to some
think tanks for polling.

14:54.107 --> 14:56.686
I'm gonna touch base
with my counterparts

14:56.710 --> 14:59.222
in Japan, India, China, and the E.U.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.591
Well, if you need
more motivation, RMSC Tokyo

15:01.615 --> 15:04.561
is reporting a new cyclone
in the Western Pacific Basin.

15:04.585 --> 15:06.986
It should be a named storm
within the hour.

15:10.991 --> 15:12.291
Henry, Pastor Eli Bragg.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.271
Pastor Bragg, Dr. Henry McCord.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.106
Hello, Pastor. Hi, I'm Henry.

15:17.130 --> 15:18.708
- Hi. Ruby.
- My daughter Ruby Bragg.

15:18.732 --> 15:20.610
She's our national co-chair

15:20.634 --> 15:22.879
and spokesperson. We were just talking

15:22.903 --> 15:24.647
about the storm. Tragic swerve.

15:24.671 --> 15:26.916
Certainly took NOAA by surprise.

15:26.940 --> 15:28.117
It's a Providence

15:28.141 --> 15:29.452
for the United States.

15:29.476 --> 15:31.754
- I see His hand in it.
- I assume

15:31.778 --> 15:34.424
you're not implying that
somehow the people of Nauru

15:34.448 --> 15:36.493
deserve this because they're sinners.

15:36.517 --> 15:38.828
Do you doubt God's role
in natural disasters?

15:38.852 --> 15:41.264
No. No, no, I doubt our ability

15:41.288 --> 15:42.265
to read His intent.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.067
Let's pivot to the intent

15:44.091 --> 15:45.535
of this meeting.

15:45.559 --> 15:47.570
I'm sure Henry is very eager

15:47.594 --> 15:48.638
to speak at your conference.

15:48.662 --> 15:50.807
And we are eager to have him. Rube?

15:50.831 --> 15:53.843
Uh, yes. This is essentially
an olive branch situation.

15:53.867 --> 15:55.778
Politically, we're at odds,
but we'd like

15:55.802 --> 15:58.081
to maintain a respectful dialogue.

15:58.105 --> 16:00.350
Particularly if Elizabeth McCord
becomes the next president.

16:00.374 --> 16:02.352
We're exploring our options.

16:02.376 --> 16:04.454
But for this dialogue to work,

16:04.478 --> 16:06.289
we do need to set a few ground rules.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.824
We simply ask that you steer away

16:07.848 --> 16:09.325
from any controversial topics.

16:09.349 --> 16:11.928
We want to build bridges here,
not burn them.

16:11.952 --> 16:14.964
I was thinking that I
would speak about poverty,

16:14.988 --> 16:16.499
what it meant in the life

16:16.523 --> 16:18.368
of Jesus and how his followers

16:18.392 --> 16:20.770
- are called to address it.
- Fine.

16:20.794 --> 16:22.639
Fine by me.

16:22.663 --> 16:24.340
I preach the gospel of charity
every Sunday.

16:24.364 --> 16:26.042
Then it's settled.

16:26.066 --> 16:28.244
Please give Conrad my best.

16:28.268 --> 16:29.512
I'm praying for him,

16:29.536 --> 16:30.513
- as always.
- Nice to meet you.

16:30.537 --> 16:31.781
Nice to meet you.

16:31.805 --> 16:32.782
Have a blessed day. Take care.

16:32.806 --> 16:33.783
Oh, thank you.

16:33.807 --> 16:35.341
Of course.

16:39.313 --> 16:40.757
That was interesting.

16:40.781 --> 16:42.091
Yeah.

16:42.115 --> 16:44.360
I get where Mike B.'s going with this,

16:44.384 --> 16:47.196
but the CRN's a viper's nest.

16:47.220 --> 16:49.132
You stay frosty
or you'll find a pair of fangs

16:49.156 --> 16:51.323
dangling from your neck.

16:54.061 --> 16:56.446
Hi.

16:56.447 --> 16:59.026
So, remember when Ashley
Whittaker was secretly dating

16:59.050 --> 17:00.928
Bryce Manley
while also dating Zac Efron?

17:00.952 --> 17:03.430
This needs to take a turn
towards work very quickly.

17:03.454 --> 17:04.765
- Wait for it.
- I was poking around

17:04.789 --> 17:05.766
Bryce's Tumblr.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.634
Turns out he owns a giant property

17:07.657 --> 17:08.635
in Fiji.

17:08.659 --> 17:09.936
Bryce Manley Island.

17:09.961 --> 17:11.571
Well above sea level.
Safe for at least

17:11.596 --> 17:13.773
two centuries, even with
the latest NASA projections.

17:13.798 --> 17:16.844
- Right.
- Plus, if you look past the infinity pools

17:16.867 --> 17:19.980
and tacky statues, it has
the infrastructure to support

17:20.003 --> 17:23.282
Nauru's population and-and
core domestic industries.

17:23.307 --> 17:25.219
Props for thinking outside of the box,

17:25.242 --> 17:26.686
but we don't have the cash.

17:26.711 --> 17:28.021
Mm, might not need it.

17:28.045 --> 17:32.159
I mean, why has Manley been
so MIA since Swashbucklers 5?

17:32.183 --> 17:33.527
Turns out he's in a legal battle

17:33.551 --> 17:36.797
with the IRS over an alleged
"tax-related impropriety."

17:36.821 --> 17:39.199
How much impropriety are we talking?

17:39.223 --> 17:40.991
So much. So much impropriety.

17:41.993 --> 17:43.971
Mm, it's worth a shot.

17:43.995 --> 17:45.606
Now all we have to do is convince

17:45.630 --> 17:47.307
a bankrupt celebrity
to give us his island,

17:47.331 --> 17:49.877
convince David Akua
to abandon his homeland,

17:49.901 --> 17:52.112
and then convince Fiji
and the U.N. to recognize

17:52.136 --> 17:55.148
the new island as
the sovereign nation of Nauru.

17:55.172 --> 17:57.885
Hmm, that's a lot of convincing,

17:57.909 --> 17:59.152
when you put it that way.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.443
Yeah.

18:03.461 --> 18:06.707
I mean, no wonder this guy's bankrupt.

18:06.731 --> 18:08.041
Yeah, that's just the private island.

18:08.065 --> 18:10.010
Don't forget about the three yachts,

18:10.034 --> 18:11.845
the six castles,
the 12-bedroom tree house.

18:11.869 --> 18:12.846
Manley's on his way

18:12.870 --> 18:13.847
with his lawyer now.

18:13.871 --> 18:14.848
I'm having Matt and Daisy run point.

18:14.872 --> 18:16.083
How far do we take it?

18:16.107 --> 18:17.438
Give him a medal if you have to.

18:17.439 --> 18:18.752
This is our best chance

18:18.776 --> 18:21.288
of convincing Akua to evacuate.

18:21.312 --> 18:22.889
Well, I hope he reconsidered.

18:22.913 --> 18:23.890
Yeah.

18:23.914 --> 18:25.092
Ready for SVTC?

18:25.116 --> 18:28.362
Uh... we'll find out.

18:28.386 --> 18:30.530
Jay, get a meeting at the White House.

18:30.554 --> 18:31.932
The sooner we can

18:31.956 --> 18:34.768
pivot to a resiliency fund,
the better.

18:34.792 --> 18:35.969
The destruction's horrific.

18:35.993 --> 18:37.838
There are bodies everywhere.

18:37.862 --> 18:38.972
In the rubble,

18:38.996 --> 18:40.140
soaking in the mud.

18:40.164 --> 18:42.075
I am so sorry.

18:42.099 --> 18:43.076
Thank you.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.111
I have to ask,

18:44.135 --> 18:45.579
did you read the report?

18:45.603 --> 18:47.547
From NASA? Yes.

18:47.571 --> 18:50.083
And I can see
the erosion with my eyes.

18:50.107 --> 18:51.551
I know the risks are high.

18:51.575 --> 18:53.987
Fatal, if you stay, David.

18:54.011 --> 18:55.989
But the good news is

18:56.013 --> 18:58.825
we may have a lead
on finding you a new home.

18:58.849 --> 19:01.595
Are you familiar with Laweron Temple?

19:01.619 --> 19:05.399
Yes, one of the largest
megalithic structures

19:05.423 --> 19:06.533
in Micronesia.

19:06.557 --> 19:08.635
And I understand
that it survived the storm.

19:08.659 --> 19:10.103
Because it was built to last forever.

19:10.127 --> 19:13.407
With pale, red bricks
that catch the morning sun.

19:13.431 --> 19:14.608
It means little to outsiders,

19:14.632 --> 19:17.344
but it's the center
of our spiritual lives.

19:17.368 --> 19:18.979
It's home, and...

19:19.003 --> 19:20.380
we cannot leave it behind.

19:20.404 --> 19:21.782
So don't.

19:21.806 --> 19:25.385
The Army Corps of Engineers will
move the temple brick by brick.

19:25.409 --> 19:27.621
And build temporary housing
while you wait.

19:27.645 --> 19:29.289
I'll talk to my people,

19:29.313 --> 19:30.824
see what I can do.

19:30.848 --> 19:31.958
Thank you, David.

19:31.982 --> 19:33.093
And good luck.

19:34.718 --> 19:36.963
First of all, huge fans. Yeah, I was

19:36.987 --> 19:40.367
a Swashbuckler every Halloween
in middle school.

19:40.391 --> 19:43.370
And recently, because
that franchise is still fresh.

19:43.394 --> 19:45.372
I've read your proposal.

19:45.396 --> 19:46.940
Can't say the same for my client.

19:46.964 --> 19:49.509
Well, the deal is simple. You donate

19:49.533 --> 19:52.345
your island to Nauru, and
we lean on the IRS to forgive

19:52.369 --> 19:55.348
- your debts.
- So, uh, Ashley says hi.

19:55.372 --> 19:57.184
Your girlfriend. That's great. Hi.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.119
But I have to say no.

19:59.143 --> 20:00.654
My client is attached

20:00.678 --> 20:01.655
to his asset.

20:01.679 --> 20:02.856
It's hallowed ground.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.257
The site of our betrothal.

20:04.281 --> 20:05.926
The locus of our wedding.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.561
You and Ashley?

20:07.585 --> 20:08.695
Congratulations.

20:08.719 --> 20:10.163
Yeah, but why not
just throw your wedding

20:10.187 --> 20:11.398
on one of your yachts?

20:11.422 --> 20:13.200
Or a castle? Or the tree house?

20:13.224 --> 20:14.167
Ooh, the tree house.

20:14.191 --> 20:15.702
Because the alternative is prison.

20:15.726 --> 20:17.304
Prison?

20:17.328 --> 20:20.073
What, wha-what do you mean, prison?

20:20.097 --> 20:21.475
- Jail.
- You're heavily

20:21.499 --> 20:22.809
overextended, Bryce.

20:22.833 --> 20:25.212
You, you told me islands
were a good investment.

20:25.236 --> 20:27.881
- I did not tell you islands were a
good investment. - Yes, you did.

20:27.905 --> 20:29.349
- Or blimps.
- Blimps?

20:29.373 --> 20:31.284
- Blimps are the future.
- Blimps are not the future, Bryce.

20:31.308 --> 20:32.953
- Hello, we talked about this. Just...
- I know.

20:32.977 --> 20:34.354
- How many times do we have to talk
about this? - Islands, blimps.

20:34.378 --> 20:36.556
I am... I'm sensing
some conflict here.

20:36.580 --> 20:39.115
So, how can we make this work?

20:42.052 --> 20:43.530
The Nobel Peace Prize?

20:43.554 --> 20:44.764
- Just the nomination.
- Really?

20:44.788 --> 20:47.400
It'll die in committee,
but I'm afraid Bryce insisted.

20:47.424 --> 20:49.603
And then we get his island?

20:49.627 --> 20:51.204
Pending approval by the IRS.

20:51.228 --> 20:54.407
But all signs point to yes.

20:54.431 --> 20:57.410
Next time I say give
a guy a medal, don't.

20:57.434 --> 20:59.179
An appropriations bill

20:59.203 --> 21:03.750
to pay for other countries
to deal with climate change?

21:03.774 --> 21:07.120
Yeah, just one question on that:
a-are you nuts?

21:07.144 --> 21:08.655
This is our only way

21:08.679 --> 21:11.658
to get our Resiliency Fund
off the ground.

21:11.682 --> 21:13.860
India, China, the E.U.

21:13.884 --> 21:15.929
are already willing to come on board.

21:15.953 --> 21:17.764
But only if we make the first move.

21:17.788 --> 21:19.366
- Yes.
- It's a gesture of good faith.

21:19.390 --> 21:21.735
Made necessary by decades as
the world's top carbon polluter.

21:21.759 --> 21:22.969
Well, haven't we done enough?

21:22.993 --> 21:25.438
We already signed
the Stockholm Protocols.

21:25.462 --> 21:28.108
No. Those were benchmarks
for future emissions.

21:28.132 --> 21:31.711
But many people, including
the Nauruans, are suffering now.

21:31.735 --> 21:34.648
Sir, Congress will laugh us out
of committee.

21:34.672 --> 21:37.417
56% of Americans support
the Resiliency Fund.

21:37.441 --> 21:40.287
- That's a clear majority.
- And since when is a majority enough?

21:40.311 --> 21:42.656
Half of Congress serves
in gerrymandered districts,

21:42.680 --> 21:44.224
beholden to their base.

21:44.248 --> 21:46.092
Guys like Owen Callister won't
even debate climate change.

21:46.116 --> 21:47.460
Some others might admit
it's happening.

21:47.484 --> 21:48.962
But take action?

21:48.986 --> 21:51.064
You... You got another thing coming.

21:51.088 --> 21:52.332
So it's pointless to even try?

21:52.356 --> 21:54.834
Oh, hello, you must be new here.

21:54.858 --> 21:56.236
Did you talk to Glenn?

21:56.260 --> 21:59.005
Yeah. NASA's projections
are staggering.

21:59.029 --> 22:00.540
This is happening.

22:00.564 --> 22:03.209
Extreme weather will destabilize
countries all across the globe.

22:03.233 --> 22:04.844
Triggering waves of refugees

22:04.868 --> 22:06.513
and accelerating the rise
of ethnic nationalism.

22:06.537 --> 22:08.815
Sir, there's already

22:08.839 --> 22:12.018
another typhoon forming
in the Pacific.

22:12.042 --> 22:13.987
It's worth the fight.

22:14.011 --> 22:15.422
Not when we lose.

22:15.446 --> 22:18.091
If Congress rejects
this Resiliency Fund,

22:18.115 --> 22:20.927
it could hamstring our
environmental agenda for years.

22:20.951 --> 22:22.495
I'm sorry, Bess.

22:22.519 --> 22:25.088
I can't let it happen.

22:28.726 --> 22:30.704
We're on our way to CRN right now.

22:30.728 --> 22:34.808
Just, uh, I'll check in
with the Swedes tomorrow.

22:34.832 --> 22:37.777
Okay. Great. Thanks.

22:37.801 --> 22:40.246
That was Jay.

22:40.270 --> 22:42.682
The IRS chief counsel signed off

22:42.706 --> 22:45.385
on the Bryce Manley deal.

22:45.409 --> 22:47.587
And Nauru's on board?

22:47.611 --> 22:49.222
Providing we move their temple. Yeah.

22:49.246 --> 22:51.291
Well, that's great news.

22:51.315 --> 22:53.560
Is it?

22:53.584 --> 22:56.329
Eccentric, broke movie star

22:56.353 --> 22:58.531
with Nobel fetish

22:58.555 --> 23:00.867
donates his private island?

23:00.891 --> 23:03.136
Probably not many times
we can go back to that well.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.172
Which is why I thought
the Resiliency Fund

23:06.196 --> 23:07.707
was a no-brainer.

23:07.731 --> 23:09.876
The crazy thing is,

23:09.900 --> 23:12.145
they can't even debate

23:12.169 --> 23:14.080
the perils
of climate change in Congress,

23:14.104 --> 23:18.418
because a cabal of special
interests won't let them.

23:18.442 --> 23:20.610
Guys like Eli Bragg.

23:22.179 --> 23:23.990
Oh, come on.

23:24.014 --> 23:26.660
You know the CRN is all in
on climate change denial.

23:26.684 --> 23:28.461
Do you want to turn around?

23:28.485 --> 23:31.798
Well, I want to hold
their feet to the fire.

23:31.822 --> 23:33.266
Babe, I'll go there.

23:33.290 --> 23:36.302
As long as we're willing
to accept the consequences.

23:36.326 --> 23:38.338
You bet.

23:38.362 --> 23:40.774
Look, I'm-I'm all for shared values.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.076
But the planet is dying.

23:43.100 --> 23:45.378
We have to, at least,
be able to talk about it.

23:45.402 --> 23:46.846
Sold.

23:46.870 --> 23:49.005
All right, how much time do we have?

23:52.476 --> 23:55.522
Genesis 2:15 uses two Hebrew words

23:55.546 --> 23:57.123
to describe God's purpose

23:57.147 --> 23:58.925
in placing man in the Garden of Eden:

23:58.949 --> 24:01.561
"Avad" and "Shamar."

24:01.585 --> 24:03.596
Meaning "serve" and "protect."

24:03.620 --> 24:06.666
It's the core of our purpose
here on Earth,

24:06.690 --> 24:09.502
and our instruction
for worshipping God.

24:09.526 --> 24:12.238
But it's hard to claim
you love the Creator,

24:12.262 --> 24:15.008
if you're ignoring the profound harm

24:15.032 --> 24:17.844
being done to His masterpiece.

24:17.868 --> 24:21.781
The longer we neglect our duty to God,

24:21.805 --> 24:24.050
the farther we stray from His purpose,

24:24.074 --> 24:26.853
and the closer we are to succumbing

24:26.877 --> 24:30.290
to an existential threat to humanity:

24:30.314 --> 24:32.358
climate change.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.662
I know that wasn't
the speech you imagined.

24:38.663 --> 24:42.302
The whole point of
the invitation was unity.

24:42.326 --> 24:44.304
We face a common threat.

24:44.328 --> 24:47.273
Solidarity is our only option.

24:47.297 --> 24:50.043
Your husband quoted Genesis,
but the moral of that book

24:50.067 --> 24:52.479
is that humans are fallible.

24:52.503 --> 24:56.750
Most doctors used to think
that leeches cured pneumonia.

24:56.774 --> 24:59.819
You really want to put
your chips on that square?

24:59.843 --> 25:03.823
Your megachurch is in a
flood zone near Greensboro.

25:03.847 --> 25:06.259
Millions of your followers

25:06.283 --> 25:08.561
are within reach of
Atlantic hurricanes.

25:08.585 --> 25:11.197
We can help protect 'em,

25:11.221 --> 25:13.900
but we need to act now.

25:13.924 --> 25:15.668
Ma'am, I'll level with you.

25:15.692 --> 25:18.304
In my opinion,
this whole climate thing

25:18.328 --> 25:20.540
is just a Trojan horse
to grow the power

25:20.564 --> 25:24.444
of the federal government
and undermine our liberty.

25:24.468 --> 25:27.580
Not the government I work for.

25:27.604 --> 25:29.572
Or one I want to lead.

25:32.442 --> 25:34.220
Come along, there are
some folks I want you to meet.

25:34.244 --> 25:35.611
Okay.

25:42.152 --> 25:43.329
Hey, Ruby.

25:43.353 --> 25:44.587
Dr. McCord.

25:46.223 --> 25:50.403
I, uh, I liked what you said
about God's masterpiece.

25:50.427 --> 25:52.539
I did a semester abroad
in New Zealand.

25:52.563 --> 25:54.407
And hiking above the Milford Sound,

25:54.431 --> 25:55.842
looking down at the fjord,

25:55.866 --> 25:57.377
I've never felt closer to God.

25:57.401 --> 25:59.779
I felt the same way
when I was a pilot,

25:59.803 --> 26:02.148
- seeing the curvature of the Earth.
- Hmm.

26:02.172 --> 26:05.051
Too bad the Earth's flat.

26:05.075 --> 26:09.289
Unfortunately, my father
isn't really one for hikes.

26:09.313 --> 26:10.456
Or empirical date.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.759
I'm guessing you are.

26:12.783 --> 26:14.561
It's a generational thing.

26:14.585 --> 26:16.062
Kind of hard to deny science

26:16.086 --> 26:17.430
when you can reach into your pocket

26:17.454 --> 26:19.255
and FaceTime your friend from Kenya.

26:21.491 --> 26:23.403
You think I'm a hypocrite

26:23.427 --> 26:26.696
because I accept global warming
and I work for CRN.

26:29.199 --> 26:31.778
Have you seen any of
the footage from Nauru?

26:31.802 --> 26:33.713
I'm not caught up on it yet.

26:33.737 --> 26:38.184
There's an interesting young man
down there, uh, David Akua.

26:38.208 --> 26:39.986
- You heard of him?
- No.

26:40.010 --> 26:41.487
You should Google him.

26:41.511 --> 26:44.490
I will.

26:44.514 --> 26:46.315
Goodbye, Dr. McCord.

26:50.687 --> 26:53.327
You sure I can't get you
something to drink?

26:53.328 --> 26:55.668
No, I won't be here long.

26:55.692 --> 26:58.271
You've been saying that
for the last 20 minutes.

26:58.295 --> 27:01.307
Because they keep not getting here.

27:01.331 --> 27:03.690
- Hello.
- Not a moment too soon.

27:03.691 --> 27:06.312
I wet/dry vac'ed the carpet,
I ran the dishwasher.

27:06.336 --> 27:08.781
I applied for some apartments...
I'm off to bed.

27:08.805 --> 27:09.916
- Thank you.
- Mike.

27:09.940 --> 27:11.150
You just can't play ball, can you?

27:11.174 --> 27:13.353
It was my speech, Mike.

27:13.377 --> 27:16.089
Cut the crap, Professor. We both
know you're in this together.

27:16.113 --> 27:17.824
So what if we are?

27:17.848 --> 27:19.692
We started a dialogue.

27:19.716 --> 27:22.061
Yeah? Well the pastor ended it.

27:22.085 --> 27:24.397
CRN just announced
a $10 million donation

27:24.421 --> 27:26.499
to Owen Callister, so congratulations.

27:26.523 --> 27:29.535
You just lost Iowa... and me. I quit.

27:29.559 --> 27:32.005
Are you kidding?

27:32.029 --> 27:34.073
No, kidding was what
I was doing to myself

27:34.097 --> 27:36.009
by thinking you could actually
make this work.

27:36.033 --> 27:38.745
By crawling through the muck,

27:38.769 --> 27:40.914
toiling thanklessly
for a pompous blue blood

27:40.938 --> 27:42.715
who'd rather be self-righteous
than president.

27:42.739 --> 27:44.350
- Excuse me?
- Hey, let's just take a breath here.

27:44.374 --> 27:47.620
I spent months getting you
this opportunity.

27:47.644 --> 27:50.223
And you-you flush it because
you're feeling mopey

27:50.247 --> 27:52.091
about your Resiliency Fund,
whatever the hell that is.

27:52.115 --> 27:53.359
Mike, it's time for you to leave.

27:53.383 --> 27:55.161
- I'm on my way.
- Mike.

27:55.185 --> 27:57.897
Hey. I am not your puppet.

27:57.921 --> 28:01.067
If I see a chance

28:01.091 --> 28:02.936
to shift the paradigm,
I'm gonna take it.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.895
Why can't you just trust me?

28:06.897 --> 28:09.175
Because I'm not a politician.

28:09.199 --> 28:12.068
And that's exactly why
you're gonna lose.

28:18.358 --> 28:21.653
Okay. Well, tell USAID
to pre-stage supplies

28:21.654 --> 28:24.800
and have PACOM standing by. Yeah.

28:24.824 --> 28:27.903
Keep me posted. Thanks.

28:27.927 --> 28:29.938
That was Blake.

28:29.962 --> 28:33.509
Tropical Storm Phoebe
is now a typhoon.

28:36.802 --> 28:40.415
So, Netflix and chill?

28:40.439 --> 28:43.952
Is there a category for
"self-righteous blue bloods"?

28:43.976 --> 28:46.488
Mike went too far.

28:46.512 --> 28:48.924
I... thought maybe you
were gonna punch him.

28:48.948 --> 28:50.782
Me, too.

28:52.785 --> 28:54.552
What if he's right about me?

28:55.655 --> 28:58.000
You know, one of the
reasons I've relied

28:58.024 --> 29:00.369
on Mike for all these years is because

29:00.393 --> 29:03.639
his assessment of people
is always dead-on.

29:03.663 --> 29:08.366
So, for him to say that about me is...

29:12.038 --> 29:14.550
This is the part where you... you say,

29:14.574 --> 29:18.220
"No, he's mistaken and insane."

29:18.244 --> 29:19.788
He's not mistaken.

29:19.812 --> 29:21.623
- Uh, thanks, pal.
- Or insane.

29:21.647 --> 29:23.358
I mean, tonight, maybe a little.

29:23.382 --> 29:27.629
But... you are stubborn
and high-minded

29:27.653 --> 29:29.765
and, ironically, for a former spy,

29:29.789 --> 29:31.867
completely allergic to duplicity.

29:31.891 --> 29:34.836
So are-are you finished?

29:34.860 --> 29:36.572
There's a but.

29:36.596 --> 29:38.307
He-He's overreacting.

29:38.331 --> 29:42.911
First of all, the evangelical
community is not a monolith.

29:42.935 --> 29:45.147
So Pastor Bragg gave money
to Callister.

29:45.171 --> 29:47.749
He represents
a narrow band of believers,

29:47.773 --> 29:50.352
and within that, there's dissent.

29:50.376 --> 29:53.555
I actually had a productive
conversation with his daughter.

29:53.579 --> 29:55.891
- The spokeswoman?
- Yeah, Ruby, yeah.

29:55.915 --> 29:58.360
Also, Mike B. talks
about your campaign

29:58.384 --> 30:00.896
- like the election is tomorrow.
- I know.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.598
Right? I haven't even declared.

30:02.622 --> 30:05.267
It's a long game.

30:05.291 --> 30:08.070
So y-you're saying there's hope,

30:08.094 --> 30:10.505
maybe I didn't just ruin everything?

30:10.529 --> 30:13.508
I'm saying that if you're
involved, there's always hope.

30:13.532 --> 30:15.477
Oh, my God.

30:15.501 --> 30:17.302
I love you so much.

30:19.372 --> 30:21.773
Got any chocolate?

30:25.778 --> 30:27.889
I wasn't expecting to hear from you,

30:27.913 --> 30:30.092
not after we backed Callister.

30:30.116 --> 30:31.927
I don't care about the money.

30:31.951 --> 30:33.729
Neither does my wife.

30:33.753 --> 30:36.431
Then why are we here?

30:36.455 --> 30:38.033
I looked you up.

30:38.057 --> 30:39.601
You used to be an activist.

30:39.625 --> 30:43.695
Coal ash is a major problem
in our communities.

30:44.930 --> 30:47.275
And you spoke out.

30:47.299 --> 30:50.646
My father raised me to believe
that my voice matters.

30:50.670 --> 30:52.014
He was right.

30:52.038 --> 30:55.917
Christ is good news
for the poor and vulnerable.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.687
We're compelled to care
for our neighbors.

30:58.711 --> 31:01.923
Charity is a cornerstone
of our ministry.

31:01.947 --> 31:05.360
We do good work without
addressing climate change.

31:05.384 --> 31:09.564
And if you don't,
then none of that matters.

31:09.588 --> 31:12.834
God's creation will be uninhabitable.

31:12.858 --> 31:14.803
I, um...

31:14.827 --> 31:19.274
I looked up that guy
in Nauru, David Akua.

31:19.298 --> 31:21.977
I can't imagine
what he's going through.

31:22.001 --> 31:24.179
So use your voice. Speak out.

31:24.203 --> 31:27.249
Yeah, that's...
that's easy for you to say.

31:27.273 --> 31:30.452
I could trash my career,
blow up my family.

31:30.476 --> 31:32.054
I know it's a leap,

31:32.078 --> 31:34.656
but you're more powerful than
you give yourself credit for.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.591
If you believe that what we do

31:36.615 --> 31:38.093
in this life determines the next,

31:38.117 --> 31:40.718
there isn't any choice at all.

31:43.322 --> 31:45.367
What did you have in mind?

31:45.391 --> 31:47.402
A simple resolution?

31:47.426 --> 31:50.372
Yeah. The Resiliency Fund
was too big of a swing.

31:50.396 --> 31:52.808
- I get that now.
- What would this resolution say exactly?

31:52.832 --> 31:54.076
The truth.

31:54.100 --> 31:55.911
That carbon pollution
causes climate change.

31:55.935 --> 31:57.279
Too bad the truth

31:57.303 --> 31:58.613
doesn't whip votes.

31:58.637 --> 32:00.849
But Ruby Bragg does.

32:00.873 --> 32:02.784
What if I told you
she was backing this?

32:02.808 --> 32:05.954
She'll go against her father?
In public?

32:05.978 --> 32:07.522
If she can divide
CRN's lobbying power,

32:07.546 --> 32:09.057
it may put us over the top.

32:09.081 --> 32:10.459
Then feel free.

32:10.483 --> 32:13.528
But are you sure you want
to go all in on a resolution?

32:13.552 --> 32:15.864
- It's symbolic at best.
- Absolutely.

32:15.888 --> 32:18.133
And unfortunately,
it isn't just symbolic.

32:18.157 --> 32:19.735
As crazy

32:19.759 --> 32:22.571
as this sounds,
we have to define truth

32:22.595 --> 32:26.541
and agree on a shared reality

32:26.565 --> 32:28.543
before any real work can even begin.

32:30.202 --> 32:32.414
Excuse me, sir. Madam Secretary,

32:32.438 --> 32:34.049
you have an urgent
call from Blake Moran.

32:34.073 --> 32:36.040
It's about Typhoon Phoebe.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.989
Please tell me that it's shifted.

32:41.013 --> 32:43.225
Uh, the American and
European models both

32:43.249 --> 32:45.961
have Phoebe making landfall in
Nauru in less than four hours.

32:45.985 --> 32:48.930
She's already a category four.

32:48.954 --> 32:51.533
Give me David Akua on SVTC

32:51.557 --> 32:53.068
right away, please.

32:53.092 --> 32:54.603
Yes, ma'am.

32:54.627 --> 32:56.138
The USS Comfort

32:56.162 --> 32:58.106
and the amphibious
transport ship San Antonio

32:58.130 --> 32:59.541
are anchored off Yangor.

32:59.565 --> 33:02.911
They can embark every single
Nauruan in less than an hour.

33:02.935 --> 33:04.846
What about our temple?

33:04.870 --> 33:07.105
I'm sorry, we're out of time.

33:08.541 --> 33:10.085
Look outside, David.

33:10.109 --> 33:12.187
The storm surge is rising.

33:12.211 --> 33:14.322
I promised them.
I mean, what-what do I do?

33:14.346 --> 33:16.124
Declare martial law.

33:16.148 --> 33:18.126
Order everyone to staging points

33:18.150 --> 33:20.562
and follow the instructions
of Pacific Command.

33:20.586 --> 33:22.564
I-I don't know what to say.

33:22.588 --> 33:24.566
The truth, David.

33:24.590 --> 33:25.801
Even when it hurts.

33:25.825 --> 33:27.602
Even when people don't want to hear.

33:27.626 --> 33:29.304
It's not that simple!

33:29.328 --> 33:31.773
You don't know
what it means to them, to me.

33:31.797 --> 33:34.009
I... There might be
a chance if we can...

33:34.033 --> 33:35.811
David?

33:35.835 --> 33:36.878
David?

33:44.428 --> 33:46.611
Why haven't we heard anything?

33:46.612 --> 33:48.508
Well, the outer
storm bands knocked out

33:48.532 --> 33:50.043
our satellite relay in Guam.

33:50.067 --> 33:51.812
Comms are slower than usual.

33:54.505 --> 33:55.916
Jay Whitman.

33:55.940 --> 33:57.640
It's PACOM.

33:58.642 --> 34:00.187
Evacuation's complete.

34:00.211 --> 34:02.245
Come on. How many?

34:04.348 --> 34:06.326
A few dozen refused
to leave the temple,

34:06.350 --> 34:08.328
but everyone else made it off
before landfall.

34:08.351 --> 34:09.696
What about David?

34:09.719 --> 34:11.097
What about David Akua?

34:11.121 --> 34:12.599
Is he on the manifest?

34:12.623 --> 34:14.568
On the USS Comfort.

34:14.592 --> 34:16.469
His mom, too.

34:16.494 --> 34:18.271
Thanks, Admiral.

34:18.295 --> 34:20.940
Now the real work begins.

34:20.965 --> 34:22.944
Uh, Ambassador Harriman
said the U.N. is ready

34:22.945 --> 34:25.391
to take up the vote on the
sovereignty transfer tomorrow.

34:25.393 --> 34:27.704
We'll make sure to keep
up the pressure in the media.

34:27.705 --> 34:28.882
What about the storm?

34:28.906 --> 34:30.384
Tracking east. Possible threat

34:30.408 --> 34:32.175
to Samoa, but we'll stay on top of it.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.469
All right. Thanks, guys.

34:36.494 --> 34:38.772
Ma'am.

34:38.795 --> 34:41.708
Nina, did Mike B. return my call?

34:41.732 --> 34:42.831
No, ma'am.

34:45.670 --> 34:47.648
Get my motorcade, will you?

34:47.672 --> 34:49.483
Right away.

34:49.507 --> 34:51.385
Have you looked at the MRI?

34:51.409 --> 34:53.253
What do you mean you haven't seen it?

34:53.277 --> 34:55.589
I sent it via Dropbox
over an hour ago.

34:55.612 --> 34:57.457
No, I'm not yelling

34:57.481 --> 34:59.159
at you, Fräulein.

34:59.183 --> 35:02.663
- Bitte. I am...
- Yes, I know there's a wait list.

35:02.687 --> 35:03.830
Bitte. Bitte.

35:03.854 --> 35:05.832
I will, I will resend.

35:05.856 --> 35:07.834
Spezialität Hundeklinik in Hamburg.

35:07.858 --> 35:09.202
They have a drug trial

35:09.226 --> 35:11.204
that has shown promise
in transgenic mice.

35:11.228 --> 35:13.106
But, yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

35:13.130 --> 35:15.309
Experimental drug
therapies in-in Germany...

35:15.333 --> 35:16.743
iffy track record, right?

35:16.767 --> 35:18.835
But desperate times, huh?

35:20.438 --> 35:22.449
This is about Gordon, huh?

35:22.473 --> 35:24.351
He has a sarcoma.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.353
It started in his
liver, and now, well,

35:26.377 --> 35:28.288
it's apparently everywhere.

35:28.312 --> 35:31.325
Chemo is not an option, it's
too late for surgery, and

35:31.349 --> 35:33.460
I swear I saved this to the desktop.

35:33.484 --> 35:35.963
Sweetheart,

35:35.987 --> 35:37.297
bless your heart.

35:37.321 --> 35:39.099
I waited too long. I should have

35:39.123 --> 35:41.201
brought him in weeks ago.
Instead, I blamed the cat.

35:41.225 --> 35:43.236
Mike, you didn't know.

35:43.260 --> 35:45.138
He's old.

35:45.162 --> 35:46.773
Did you get a second opinion?

35:46.797 --> 35:48.709
I got five.

35:48.733 --> 35:50.243
And now they're recommending
palliative care,

35:50.267 --> 35:52.179
which is vet-speak for
"quitting," which I won't do.

35:52.203 --> 35:53.480
We're gonna save you, buddy.

35:53.504 --> 35:55.849
You can help me clear him
through E.U. Customs, right?

35:55.873 --> 35:57.725
I saved it right here on the
desktop, I swear to God.

35:57.749 --> 36:00.572
Mike. Stop.

36:01.245 --> 36:03.646
Just stop, okay?

36:16.527 --> 36:18.705
You know how Truman said

36:18.729 --> 36:21.842
if you want a friend
in Washington, get a dog?

36:21.866 --> 36:24.544
I did.

36:24.568 --> 36:26.636
God, now what?

36:37.782 --> 36:39.760
I'm your friend, Mike.

36:39.784 --> 36:41.618
I'll always be here.

36:45.689 --> 36:48.935
I remember when Gordon came
to UVA as a puppy.

36:50.761 --> 36:52.339
He peed in the faculty lounge.

36:53.731 --> 36:55.042
He peed in my office.

36:56.734 --> 36:58.879
- In my shoes.
- He, he always

36:58.903 --> 37:01.014
looked right at you
when he did it, too.

37:01.038 --> 37:03.773
Oh, those were the days.

37:05.042 --> 37:07.287
Eight hours to Germany.
What am I thinking?

37:09.313 --> 37:11.648
That it's really hard to say goodbye.

37:17.088 --> 37:19.066
Thank you.

37:20.791 --> 37:22.469
And I'm sorry about yesterday.

37:22.493 --> 37:24.438
- Don't worry about it.
- Ah.

37:24.462 --> 37:27.174
Oh, in your stupid climate resolution,

37:27.198 --> 37:28.909
you really should add a...

37:28.933 --> 37:31.378
an expression of sympathy
for the people of Nauru.

37:31.402 --> 37:33.480
No one wants
to look like a heartless jerk

37:33.504 --> 37:34.915
for a symbolic vote.

37:36.807 --> 37:38.218
I thought you quit.

37:38.242 --> 37:40.220
What did I just say about quitting?

37:43.447 --> 37:45.097
The Dalton administration

37:45.121 --> 37:46.660
has just put forward a resolution

37:46.684 --> 37:49.162
that takes responsibility
for global warming.

37:49.186 --> 37:52.632
Now, your father called
it "toxic propaganda."

37:52.656 --> 37:55.802
With respect, I disagree.

37:55.826 --> 37:59.039
I love my dad, but he's so
afraid of government regulation

37:59.063 --> 38:02.476
that he's willing
to ignore 99.9% of scientists.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.744
You know what's scarier
than big government?

38:04.768 --> 38:06.012
Massive typhoons

38:06.036 --> 38:07.180
in the Pacific.

38:07.204 --> 38:09.182
Drought and wildfire
in the American West.

38:09.206 --> 38:10.884
Starvation and disease.

38:10.908 --> 38:12.185
But those things, when they happen,

38:12.209 --> 38:13.820
aren't they the will of God?

38:15.112 --> 38:17.691
The Lord calls us
to be stewards of this Earth.

38:17.715 --> 38:21.094
Now, if He really wants
these things to happen,

38:21.118 --> 38:23.263
why would He give us the power
to change it?

38:23.287 --> 38:24.931
I disagree
with the Dalton administration

38:24.955 --> 38:26.366
on more issues than I could name,

38:26.390 --> 38:30.103
but I represent a generation
of young evangelicals

38:30.127 --> 38:31.605
who care about climate change,

38:31.629 --> 38:34.307
and we won't stay silent any longer.

38:34.331 --> 38:35.509
- Wow.
- So, to be clear,

38:35.533 --> 38:36.943
you pers...

38:36.967 --> 38:38.945
She's good.

38:38.969 --> 38:41.271
Her old man better watch his back.

38:42.606 --> 38:46.186
Or you could just be moved
by her sincerity, you know.

38:47.645 --> 38:50.323
Sorry, sir.
Um, Dad, you wanted to know.

38:50.347 --> 38:51.992
The vote
on that resolution is starting.

38:52.016 --> 38:54.027
Ruby Bragg's

38:54.051 --> 38:56.029
TV interview is trending on Twitter.

38:56.053 --> 38:58.532
And my sources on the Hill say
the phones are lighting up.

38:58.556 --> 39:00.133
PR-wise, it's an earthquake.

39:00.157 --> 39:02.435
Maybe let's avoid natural
disaster metaphors for a while.

39:03.694 --> 39:07.040
Final tally on S-Res 607.

39:07.064 --> 39:09.876
"A resolution in support
of the people of Nauru

39:09.900 --> 39:11.711
"in their difficult time,

39:11.735 --> 39:14.414
"and in recognition of
the role carbon emissions

39:14.438 --> 39:16.816
"by industrialized nations played

39:16.840 --> 39:20.053
as a contributing factor
to the disaster."

39:20.077 --> 39:23.356
51 in favor, 47 against,

39:23.380 --> 39:25.325
two abstaining.

39:25.349 --> 39:26.493
Resolution passes.

39:28.419 --> 39:30.430
Admitting climate change?

39:30.454 --> 39:31.631
That's a watershed.

39:31.655 --> 39:33.200
I just wish these resolutions

39:33.224 --> 39:34.434
had the force of law.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.269
- Me, too.
- Guys, there's

39:36.293 --> 39:38.205
something you need to see.

39:38.229 --> 39:40.173
What is that?

39:40.197 --> 39:42.842
That is... Nauru.

39:42.866 --> 39:44.511
Zoom in.

39:44.535 --> 39:45.879
We are zoomed in.

39:45.903 --> 39:47.470
Wait. Go back.

39:49.907 --> 39:51.284
Where is it?

39:51.308 --> 39:52.586
Not there.

39:52.610 --> 39:54.287
That-That's impossible.

39:54.311 --> 39:57.057
It's happened before,
in Hawaii, the Bay of Bengal.

39:57.081 --> 39:58.425
Yeah, but those were specks.

39:58.449 --> 40:00.527
Nauru is eight square miles.

40:00.551 --> 40:02.362
The coral sediment collapsed
under the wave pressure.

40:02.386 --> 40:03.763
And without bedrock...

40:03.787 --> 40:06.032
You're kidding. So the entire island

40:06.056 --> 40:08.224
just... disappeared?

40:09.226 --> 40:11.260
NASA confirmed. It's gone.

40:12.596 --> 40:13.830
Wow.

42:18.328 --> 42:24.428
