00:02.500 --> 00:04.058
***

00:06.840 --> 00:10.003
- There he is
waiting for his lady friend.

00:12.710 --> 00:15.031
- This guy can afford
five stars; why the cheap motel?

00:15.080 --> 00:17.571
- It's part of the fantasy.
Some people get off on slumming.

00:17.610 --> 00:20.340
- You're speaking
from personal experience?

00:21.820 --> 00:23.811
I always thought
being a professional voyeur

00:23.850 --> 00:26.284
would be far more exciting.
- If you're so bored,

00:26.320 --> 00:28.288
you could study
for your P.I. exam.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.551
- You know, I've always been
more of a school-of—life
kind of guy.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.822
- No exam, no P.I. license,
no job. Here she is.

00:35.860 --> 00:38.795
Let the games begin.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.704
You know, what they don't

00:42.740 --> 00:44.708
teach you in P.I. school
is how to get "The Money Shot."

00:44.740 --> 00:47.334
The clients always want proof.
You need a kiss,

00:47.380 --> 00:49.678
an embrace and... lift off.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.679
That was the real money shot.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.518
The way two people look at
each other tells you everything.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.848
Unfortunately, it's not
real evidence of adultery.

00:57.890 --> 01:01.610
- Looks like the real thing.
- Three months, they'll
be back on OKCupid.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.457
- Is there no romance
In your soul?

01:03.490 --> 01:05.685
- Not lurking outside
a no-tell motel there isn't.

01:05.730 --> 01:07.550
Stay here.
- Hey! Hey, hey!

01:07.600 --> 01:10.398
What can I learn
Sitting In a car?
- Try the book.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.432
You need to study.

01:12.470 --> 01:15.064
***

01:21.540 --> 01:23.701
- Everett Investigations.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.641
Could you repeat that, please?

01:27.680 --> 01:30.740
- Come on!
Move to where I can see you.

01:32.690 --> 01:35.079
OK. Here we go.

01:37.490 --> 01:38.684
Hey, Shade!

01:38.730 --> 01:40.789
What are you doing?

01:40.830 --> 01:42.866
- That is how you get
the money shot

01:42.900 --> 01:46.768
when the clock is winding down.
- Hmm! Not bad. Still not cool.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.337
- Big case came in.
It's time sensitive.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.565
- Every case is time sensitive.
- But not every case

01:51.610 --> 01:54.272
is a diamond heist.
- Hey! Get back here!

01:54.310 --> 01:56.278
- I love diamonds! Let's go!
- Yeah!

01:56.310 --> 01:59.677
- Give me the camera! Hey!

02:02.490 --> 02:05.311
Stop!

02:16.730 --> 02:18.618
- Mr, Mrs. Cutler.
Angie Everett.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.662
This is my, uh, associate,
Matt Shade.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.634
Please tell us
about the theft.

02:23.670 --> 02:26.434
- It's devastating,
horrible! I...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.869
- We got a call an hour ago
that she was missing.

02:30.710 --> 02:33.543
- On the phone, you said
this was about a diamond heist.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.571
- No, no. Not "a." The.

02:35.620 --> 02:38.885
Diamond Heist is our racehorse,
and she's disappeared.

02:41.820 --> 02:45.324
- ** I see you and you see me

02:45.360 --> 02:47.692
* Watch you blowing the lines

02:47.730 --> 02:49.664
* When you're making a scene

02:49.700 --> 02:53.295
* Oh boy, you've got to know

02:53.340 --> 02:55.467
* What my head overlooks

02:55.500 --> 02:58.936
* The senses will show
to my heart *

02:58.970 --> 03:01.632
* When it's watching for lies

03:01.680 --> 03:03.944
* 'Cause you can't escape my

03:03.980 --> 03:05.868
* Private eyes

03:05.910 --> 03:08.310
* They're watching you

03:08.350 --> 03:10.443
* Private eyes

03:10.490 --> 03:12.378
* They're watching you,
watching you *

03:12.420 --> 03:14.786
* Watching you, watching you *

03:16.930 --> 03:19.854
***

03:19.900 --> 03:22.721
- Our jockey, Carly, notified us
that she was missing.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.419
She's our three-year-old filly.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.267
- She's a beautiful horse.
- Mm-hmm.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.564
Worth over a million dollars.
She's the favourite to win

03:28.600 --> 03:30.761
Summerhill Derby this weekend.

03:30.810 --> 03:33.233
- Nothing.
She just vanished.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.702
- No, no, no, no.

03:34.740 --> 03:37.243
We don't want to risk
spooklng whoever took her.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.272
Look, your agency came highly
recommended by our lawyer,

03:40.320 --> 03:42.880
and if you're effective,
we're hoping she'll be
racing in the derby.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.842
Failing that, we just...
we just want

03:44.890 --> 03:47.882
to find her.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.286
- Just one second.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.728
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.728
Million-dollar racehorses

03:55.760 --> 03:58.024
versus by
What's the debate?

03:58.070 --> 04:00.436
- I don't like horses.
- But you like sitting

04:00.470 --> 04:02.529
in your car for hours
playing peekaboo

04:02.570 --> 04:05.266
with Cheaty McCheatersons?
- My agency, my call.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.979
- This is_a retainer
to get thIngs gomg.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.843
If you find Diamond Heist
in time to run the derby,

04:11.880 --> 04:15.873
I'll triple that.
- We're on it.

04:19.490 --> 04:20.855
: Morning.

04:20.890 --> 04:23.358
- Hey, Jules.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.858
You may want to take
another run at those buttons.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.789
- I'm off my game,
I could not sleep last night.

04:30.830 --> 04:33.037
- Human cloning.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.834
- Yeah, I hear you.

04:35.870 --> 04:37.838
- For the debate team,
I'm taking the pro position,

04:37.870 --> 04:40.600
but I'm not even_ sure
If I am for cloning.

04:43.510 --> 04:46.968
- That and preparation.
- You know, you have

04:47.020 --> 04:49.488
a very specific inflection
to your voice when you're about

04:49.520 --> 04:52.887
to launch into a hockey lecture.
- Back in my IPHL days,

04:52.920 --> 04:55.514
before a game,
I would study

04:55.560 --> 04:57.858
every play, I'd watch
every second of game tape.

04:57.890 --> 05:00.393
I knew what my opponent
was gonna do before he did,

05:00.430 --> 05:03.422
so when I hit the ice,
I was in the zone.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.337
Preparation works every time.
- Yeah, how's the preparation

05:06.370 --> 05:09.669
for your P.I. exam going?
- Got my textbook right here.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.770
- Yeah, it feels like
it hasn't even been opened yet.

05:12.810 --> 05:15.904
- Angie's giving me
a lot of on-the—job training.

05:15.940 --> 05:19.046
Hmm! Speak of the P.I. devil.

05:19.080 --> 05:21.640
Gotta run, honey. Love you.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.648
- Preparation, Dad.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.386
- Yeah, preparation.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.411
- Yeah, I heard that.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.451
- How could you have
possibly heard that?

05:32.460 --> 05:33.996
Look around you,

05:34.030 --> 05:36.794
Everett. Sunshine, adrenaline--

05:36.830 --> 05:39.060
: Horse manure.
- Admit it.

05:39.100 --> 05:42.035
A stolen horse is even better
than stolen diamonds.

05:42.070 --> 05:44.800
- Let's just get this over with.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.933
Horse racing
is the sport of kings.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.608
- Start at the backstretch.
That's where the horses

05:49.650 --> 05:51.106
are stabled and
the downstairs folk hang out.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.642
- Racing has a real
class divide.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.649
There's the millionaire horse
hobbyists, like the Cutlers.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.612
Then, there's the staff
on the ground that makes

05:59.660 --> 06:02.151
this gangster system run.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.681
- Did you know

06:04.730 --> 06:07.756
that 90%_ of abductions
are committed by people
known to the victims?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.768
- You realize we're looking
for a horse, right?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.768
- Horses come with an entourage:

06:11.800 --> 06:13.995
jockey, trainer, groom,
exerciser, stable hand.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.031
That's a family.
My money's on one of them.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.445
- Page 14 of the P.I. textbook
is the "Intelligence Checklist."

06:22.480 --> 06:24.107
Show me what you've learned.
- Right!

06:24.150 --> 06:26.539
Intelligence Checklist, yes!

06:26.580 --> 06:28.548
Well...

06:30.550 --> 06:33.883
There's no horse. Haha!
- Great attention to detail.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.911
What else?
- Uh,

06:35.960 --> 06:38.588
security cameras?

06:38.630 --> 06:40.120
- There are _none.
- Keep gomg.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.560
- Umm, I got a better idea.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.898
Why don't you tell me
what you would look for?

06:44.930 --> 06:47.933
- Yes, coach!

06:47.970 --> 06:49.835
- First, I'd look
for signs of forced entry--

06:49.870 --> 06:52.065
- Forced entry. Yes,
that's what I was gonna say.

06:52.110 --> 06:54.078
- But it appears
the thief

06:54.110 --> 06:56.442
or thieves just
walked right out of here.

06:56.480 --> 06:59.813
These horses are worth millions,
and half the people at the
track are crooks.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.683
No cameras, no security?
Just doesn't make any sense.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.984
- Right.
- Let's go talk to the jockey.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.908
Carly King.
- Good idea.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.623
It's exactly
what I was gonna say.

07:10.660 --> 07:14.198
- You and Diamond have been on
qUIte the Winning streak lately.

07:14.230 --> 07:16.619
Four major races in a row,
impressive.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.626
- She's an impressive horse.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.934
- The Cutlers said you called
them last night around 10 pm.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.200
- Yeah. As soon as I realized
that she was missing.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.663
- Are you usually
at the track that late?

07:25.710 --> 07:29.669
- I was having a couple
of drinks in the bar.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.974
- Yeah. I guess I was nervous.

07:32.010 --> 07:34.012
- About Diamond.

07:34.050 --> 07:35.915
Look, usually, she loves to run.

07:35.950 --> 07:37.884
I mean, this horse
lives for it.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.979
But lately, she's needed
more encouragement.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.988
- After you took her out, did
you turn her over to the groom?

07:42.020 --> 07:43.920
- No. To Keith, our trainer.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.951
He's the one that likes
to cool her down.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.898
- So, Keith,
after the cool down,

07:52.940 --> 07:55.500
Diamond was alone in her stall?
: I came back

07:55.540 --> 07:57.929
to feed her around 5,
but after that, aye.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.938
- I noticed security cameras
around the track,

07:59.980 --> 08:02.039
but none in the stalls.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.140
That's up to the owners. Some
have 'em installed, some don't.

08:05.180 --> 08:08.172
- So, you weren't
on the track last night?

08:08.220 --> 08:10.108
- No, sir.
Horses are like fighters.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.186
You gotta give them time
to get right.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.154
- You've been in this game
a long time.

08:14.190 --> 08:16.988
- Left school for it.
- Sounds like a calling.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.986
- That's not Church;
it's horses.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.021
- You worship them
just the same.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.668
- Horses tend to be
more noble than people.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.589
- You could be right there.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.961
- So you do like horses.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.672
- Let's split up.
I'll go to the security office

08:32.710 --> 08:34.928
pull some footage; you go
railside, talk to the locals,

08:34.980 --> 08:36.948
get the gossip.
Act dumb, look pretty.

08:36.980 --> 08:38.845
Use what's left
of your celebrity.

08:40.750 --> 08:43.810
***

08:43.850 --> 08:46.216
Boys.

08:46.250 --> 08:50.129
Beautiful clay, beautiful sport.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.822
- Matt Shade!

08:52.860 --> 08:54.555
- Guilty as charged.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.864
And you are?
- Such a big fan of yours.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.868
Those years
you played in Chicago --

08:58.900 --> 09:00.663
magic.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.634
l\_lora.
- Hi, Nora.

09:04.910 --> 09:08.209
- So who do you think
looks good out there?

09:08.240 --> 09:10.845
- The black one.
- "Made Runner."

09:10.880 --> 09:12.916
Good blood, bad legs.
Her mommy and daddy

09:14.880 --> 09:17.587
to her bloodline.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.656
- Honey, I know everything
about horses.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.954
Hey, you see that one

09:21.990 --> 09:24.026
"Make it Reins."

09:24.060 --> 09:26.028
Nice, even temperament,

09:26.060 --> 09:30.099
exceptional physicality.
Knows how to perform.

09:30.130 --> 09:32.291
-Hmmm

09:39.880 --> 09:41.632
- What's up with you
and that guy

09:41.680 --> 09:45.275
- I don't give bad dates.
- Of course. I meant him.

09:45.310 --> 09:47.870
- I know you did.
- Ha!

09:49.990 --> 09:52.379
Angie! This is Nora.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.980
She knows everything
about horses, so I was thinking

09:55.020 --> 09:56.385
maybe we could

09:56.420 --> 09:59.059
team... up.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.058
You know, I'm no expert

10:01.100 --> 10:03.068
in the subtleties
of female communication,

10:03.100 --> 10:04.988
but it seems you two
know each other.

10:05.030 --> 10:07.737
- Angie.
- Mom.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.379
: Angie, wait! Stop!

10:17.410 --> 10:19.878
Angie...
- You are unbelievable.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.876
- I like the way
you're doing your hair now.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.218
You knew we were
working together.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.184
- What is wrong with a mother
taking an interest

10:26.220 --> 10:28.381
in her daughter? I google
because I care, sweetie.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.978
- Wait, so you're not
a Chicago fan?

10:30.030 --> 10:34.023
- I'm gonna tell you
this once, Shade: nothing
good can come from my mother.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.789
- She's always been
a touch on the dramatic side.

10:35.830 --> 10:39.960
- Oh, come on, Ang! She knows
this world inside out. You don't
think she could be useful?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.968
- OK. Mom, could you
help us out here?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.900
- I would love to.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.999
Isn't this nice?
- For a small fee.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.905
- And there it is.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.344
- I can't believe
you fell for that act.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.883
Same old song and dance.
- It's a bad time

10:57.920 --> 11:02.016
to tell you you've
got your mother's eyes?
- I don't have her anything!

11:02.060 --> 11:05.086
I haven't seen that woman
Since my dad's funeral.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.121
Pretty sure she was
after money then, too.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.321
- This is why you didn't
want to take the case.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.863
- My mom, let's say,
calculating.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.868
Also, ooh, devious

11:13.900 --> 11:15.936
and untrustworthy.
- Hm, don't hold back.

11:15.970 --> 11:17.835
- In my sleep.

11:19.370 --> 11:22.237
P|aid?_!
- Just put it on.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.169
- Look, for future reference,
I'm more of a solids guy.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.713
What are we doing?
- We're roleplaying.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.718
You're Matt Shade.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.718
You're an ex-pro hockey player,

11:31.750 --> 11:34.082
and I am your arm candy.

11:34.120 --> 11:37.055
We're gonna talk to Ivan Zickel.
- Am I supposed to know
who that is?

11:37.090 --> 11:38.489
- He's the owner
of Gold Coast.

11:38.530 --> 11:41.249
It's a champion stallion
shipped in for the derby.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.768
Gold Coast and Diamond Heist
are neck and neck

11:43.800 --> 11:45.768
in pedigree and standing.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.791
- So if this is about rivalry--

11:47.840 --> 11:49.933
- No one's more motivated
than Ivan.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.973
- You are gonna be
interested in buying Gold Coast.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.978
- And you're happy
being my "arm candy"?

11:55.010 --> 11:58.502
- You know, as long as the
spotlight is on you,
then it's off me.

11:58.550 --> 12:02.884
- Wow! Not in that dress.
- Ivan's from your world.
He's all money and scotch

12:02.920 --> 12:04.888
and $90 haircuts.
Bet you anything

12:04.920 --> 12:08.014
he's one of those typical,
alpha-male douchebags.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.221
- You say that
like it's a bad thing.

12:10.260 --> 12:13.252
So Gold Coast and Diamond Heist
have quite the rivalry.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.155
-_ Gold Coast C&Ds are _
38% higher than Diamond Heist's.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.998
And with her L.O.T.'s down 24%
and the fact

12:19.030 --> 12:21.863
that Diamond Heist is always
17% slower on soft track,

12:21.900 --> 12:24.539
Gold Coast has a_97% chance
of Winning.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.879
- I'm not even gonna
pretend I understand

12:26.910 --> 12:29.902
what you just said.
- It's all here in my app.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.906
It's called Saddleplay,
an algorithm

12:31.950 --> 12:34.145
that uses advanced stats
to predict racmg results.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.547
This baby's gonna
revolutionize the industry.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.479
- I also designed Ping Squad,

12:40.520 --> 12:44.058
an app that taps
into cell-tower frequency
to maximize bandwidth, giving

12:44.090 --> 12:47.150
sat-level strength. Sold it
to the military last year but...

12:47.200 --> 12:49.919
...would be rude to say
for how much. 12 million.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.859
- So...

12:52.900 --> 12:54.265
you're not interested
in selling Gold Coast?

12:54.300 --> 12:56.495
- Don't be ridiculous,
Mr. Shade. He's in his prime.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.531
_We're similar
in that regard.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.943
- Xi Jinping, sir.

13:03.980 --> 13:05.971
- Thank you for your interest,
Mr. Shade.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.376
Pleasure meeting you.
I've always been

13:08.420 --> 13:10.945
a big Georgia fan.
- I played for Chicago.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.912
- Well, I got
the douchebag part right.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.110
- Yeah, it's why
jocks hate geeks.

13:17.090 --> 13:19.285
- Game seven Montreal-Santa Fe,

13:19.330 --> 13:21.992
high-profile play-offs,
big money. The ref got caught

13:22.030 --> 13:23.918
fixing the game for a bookie
who was offside with his bets

13:23.970 --> 13:26.291
who couldn't lay off the risk.
- Translate please.

13:26.330 --> 13:29.959
- Cowboy Hat back there
is a bookie. Sometimes,
bookies get in over their heads

13:30.010 --> 13:32.069
and take_ drastic measures
to manipulate the odds.

13:32.110 --> 13:34.999
- Like steal a horse.
How do you know

13:35.040 --> 13:37.873
he's a bookie?
- Saw your mom trying to hide
from him. She owes him money.

13:37.910 --> 13:39.502
- You should check your wallet;
she probably owes you money too.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.429
: OK, look, I can get
you the money tomorrow.

14:02.470 --> 14:04.438
: That's what you said
yesterday! I'm tired of waiting!

14:04.470 --> 14:06.301
: Wait, wait! Stop!
Get your hands off!

14:06.340 --> 14:08.570
: Give me my money!
- Please, I'm gonna pay you!

14:08.610 --> 14:11.249
- Hey!
- Oh!

14:11.280 --> 14:13.475
Ah!

14:15.920 --> 14:17.888
We'll take this up later.
- Don't think so,

14:17.920 --> 14:19.615
Rodeo Clown.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.528
- How long have you been
betting on the races?

14:27.560 --> 14:30.028
- I did it once;

14:30.070 --> 14:32.527
it was the biggest mistake
of my life.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.038
- I can see the headline now:

14:35.070 --> 14:37.038
"Jockey steals racehorse
to pay off debts."

14:37.070 --> 14:39.334
- I would never
do that, OK?

14:39.370 --> 14:42.100
Diamond is my only way
out of this mess.

14:42.140 --> 14:44.074
The purse for this race is huge.

14:44.110 --> 14:47.375
IfI win, I can clear my debts.
- Then help us find her.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.345
- I told you everything I know.
- Have you noticed anyone
suspicious hanging around?

14:51.390 --> 14:53.449
- Everyone is suspicious
around here.

14:53.490 --> 14:56.050
- Come on, Carly, think.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.554
- OK, there was this guy.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.092
He looked like a biker.
I mean, bikers hang around

15:04.130 --> 15:05.961
the track all the time,
but this one,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.969
he was taking photos
of the horses in the barn.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.605
- Like someone you wouldn't
want to mess with.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.575
He had this really creepy
gang patch --

15:14.610 --> 15:16.635
a horse skeleton.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.382
- No creepy horse skeleton yet.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.411
Find anything
in the security footage?

15:28.460 --> 15:30.678
- I logged all the trailers
going in and out

15:30.730 --> 15:32.527
the night
that Diamond went missing.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.097
They all match up with horses
competing in the derby.

15:35.130 --> 15:37.598
Check this out.

15:37.630 --> 15:40.531
It's Ivan Zickel's.
Custom designed by Rolls Royce.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.492
- Some people have
too much money.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.360
- Copy that.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.537
- Wait!

15:46.570 --> 15:49.334
The insignia of a biker gang

15:49.380 --> 15:52.144
called The Beasts of Burden.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.047
- What would a biker gang
want with a horse?

15:55.080 --> 15:57.389
Kind of goes against
being a biker, doesn't it?

15:57.420 --> 16:01.117
- I'll keep digging. And you...

16:03.460 --> 16:06.429
- Don't forget to
give that back to me.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.348
- Ooh, I think I'm kind
of digging the plaid.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.198
- Hmmm, I think you were right.
It's not your style.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.494
Good night, Shade.
- Is this the part

16:13.540 --> 16:15.496
where you tell me to go home
and study for the P.I. exam?

16:15.540 --> 16:18.065
- It's up to you.
- I'm going to nail it.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.601
- Totally holding my breath.
Don't forget to lock up
on your way out.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.108
-Hmm!
***

16:27.720 --> 16:29.642
***

16:46.430 --> 16:48.398
- Test must be coming up soon.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.034
Starting to procrastinate
for real now.

16:51.070 --> 16:53.379
- Come on, Dad, I suck
at writing these things.

16:53.410 --> 16:55.776
- You always got by in school.
- That's because

16:55.810 --> 16:58.779
I was a hockey player
and there was an understanding.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.517
We passed,
even when we didn't pass.

17:01.550 --> 17:05.042
Which we didn't. Ever.
- So study.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.411
It's what everybody else does.
- Come on, Dad,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.553
that book is 250 pages

17:09.590 --> 17:11.478
of facts and rules,
and the only pictures

17:11.530 --> 17:15.125
are of fat guy on stakeouts.
- So it's boat building

17:15.160 --> 17:17.526
all over again, huh?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.788
- You fall in love
with some new hobby

17:19.830 --> 17:22.469
and convince yourself
that there's a career in it.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.367
And when the novelty wore of,
you moved on to something else.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.674
Restaurants, wine making,

17:27.710 --> 17:31.077
landscape photography...
- This isn't that!

17:31.110 --> 17:33.214
What's different?

17:35.550 --> 17:37.518
- The cases I've worked
with Angie,

17:37.550 --> 17:39.518
we actually help people.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.314
I didn't know I wanted
to do that until I did.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.682
- Ah.

17:45.730 --> 17:49.097
Well, personally, I did find
the wine making helpful.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.691
I'm starting to feel
like an old dog.

17:54.870 --> 17:57.168
Don't know if I've got
any new tricks.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.098
- You can pass
this exam, Matt.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.701
And I'll help.

18:02.740 --> 18:05.243
- No, but I will take this
from you.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.545
- I'm actually hungry.
- Study.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.558
: Are you sure
about this? Doesn't seem

18:20.600 --> 18:22.591
like the ideal place
for a biker hangout.

18:22.630 --> 18:25.167
: Trust me, my
information's good on this one.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.724
- Beasts of Burden apparently

18:26.770 --> 18:28.761
like their privacy.
- Maybe because they're hiding

18:28.800 --> 18:30.768
a million-dollar horse.
- How did you

18:30.810 --> 18:32.698
find them?
- I have my ways.

18:32.740 --> 18:34.674
- You flirted with a cop,
didn't you?

18:34.710 --> 18:37.178
- I have more ways
than that. But yes.

18:37.210 --> 18:40.179
- This seems like a bad idea.
- Only if they're home.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.176
- Don't you usually check
that sort of thing?

18:42.220 --> 18:43.847
- They failed to send
me an itinerary.

18:48.190 --> 18:50.454
Which seems like
an over5ight now.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.866
This is all a misunderstanding.
Just give us back our phones

19:05.910 --> 19:08.777
and our wallets and--
- Shut up!

19:08.810 --> 19:11.370
I got a theory about
private investigators.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.674
Dirty cops
on a second career.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.211
- Dirty hockey player on
a second career; she's the P.I.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.549
- Like he said, I'm the P.I.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.911
- "Brandi, Tammi, Kristi."

19:21.960 --> 19:24.178
Do you know any women whose
names don't end in a vowel?

19:24.230 --> 19:26.152
- Whatever you're about
to say, don't.

19:29.230 --> 19:32.199
- What are you doing with
Jim and Bridget Cutler?
- None of your business.

19:32.230 --> 19:35.768
- Well, I'm gonna go out on
a limb and suggest that
they're your clients.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.860
You could say I've
worked with them too.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.878
We're an animal rescue society.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.344
We protect the welfare
of abused animals.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.440
- Yeah. The Beasts of Burden
are committed to the cause,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.846
and they provide protection.
Animal rescue can be

19:48.880 --> 19:51.986
a dangerous game. Ah!
When you finish with that,

19:52.020 --> 19:54.853
can you straighten out
those bales of hay in the back?

19:54.890 --> 19:58.223
Thanks. When those boys give up
leather and put on overalls,

19:58.260 --> 20:00.399
I can retire.

20:00.430 --> 20:03.319
This is Buddy.
Hey, boy.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.258
Buddy was a racehorse.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.268
- Hey, Buddy.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.758
- This was Buddy when I got him.
He belonged to the Cutlers.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.938
- Jim Cutler treats his horses

20:13.980 --> 20:16.278
like four-legged
stacks of cash.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.949
I've seen it time
and time again.

20:18.980 --> 20:22.017
He runs his horses ragged,
then he discards them when
they're not Winning anymore.

20:22.050 --> 20:24.382
- So you stole him.
- We prefer

20:24.420 --> 20:27.014
the term "liberated."

20:27.050 --> 20:28.881
did you liberate her?

20:28.920 --> 20:30.922
- Haha! I like you.
You're very direct.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.951
But if you want my advice,

20:32.990 --> 20:34.992
I think you should be
looking into your clients.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.794
: So the Cutlers hire
us to find their prize racehorse

20:41.840 --> 20:44.707
two days before the big race.
Only, the local jockey

20:44.740 --> 20:46.708
tells us she hasn't been
performing very well lately.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.708
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:48.740 --> 20:50.742
: I doubt it.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.746
- No camera in the stall

20:54.780 --> 20:56.873
and no cop involvement;
it all adds up.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.844
- Admittedly, I've never been
big on math, but I fail to see

20:59.890 --> 21:03.428
how this adds up.
- An insurance scam. I've done
hundreds of cases like this.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.883
The client sinks their own boat
to cash out on a claim,

21:05.930 --> 21:08.649
then hires me for due diligence.
- You think they're hiding
Diamond Heist?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.622
- All anyone cares about
on the track is money.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.888
This is exactly why I avoid
this world and everything

21:12.930 --> 21:14.932
that comes with it.
- This may seem like a big leap,

21:14.970 --> 21:17.029
totally out of left field,
but don't you think

21:17.070 --> 21:19.834
there could be some
other issues at play here?

21:19.870 --> 21:22.976
Unresolved mother-daughter-
type issues maybe?

21:23.010 --> 21:24.944
- No, no. This is about
our lying, Richie-Rich,

21:24.980 --> 21:26.971
high-roller clients,
and I'm gonna prove it.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.088
- We've met with everyone
in Diamond's camp,

21:31.120 --> 21:33.418
still no trace of her...
- Oh, gosh!

21:33.460 --> 21:36.759
- Note to self:
easy on the caffeine. Do you
mind if I use your bathroom?

21:36.790 --> 21:40.521
- End of the hall,
door on the right.
- Thank you.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.625
- Uh, alright,
so no trace of her.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.463
- Oh, Angie spoke out of turn,

21:51.510 --> 21:53.899
Of course,
we've found traces.

21:53.940 --> 21:56.033
I mean, what kind of P.I.'s
would we be if

21:56.080 --> 21:59.402
we couldn't find traces.

21:59.450 --> 22:02.749
I mean, there's always traces
when you...

22:02.780 --> 22:06.011
...enter a crime scene.

22:11.530 --> 22:15.022
So how long have you guys been
in the racing biz anyhow?

22:15.060 --> 22:16.755
- Uh, about six years or so.
!

22:16.800 --> 22:19.963
And this is the first time
you've had a horse go missing?
Those are pretty good odds!

22:20.000 --> 22:22.059
- Are you suggesting
that's what's happened here?

22:22.100 --> 22:23.965
- Well... Hahaha!

22:24.010 --> 22:27.707
You know how kids
just wander off sometimes?

22:27.740 --> 22:30.038
Hahaha!

22:30.080 --> 22:31.968
Not that Diamond Heist
just wandered off.

22:32.010 --> 22:33.910
Let me tell you
what we know.

22:47.030 --> 22:49.055
Private investigating

22:49.100 --> 22:53.127
is a lot like a hockey game --
you have to see

22:53.170 --> 22:55.968
every case from all angles.

22:58.070 --> 23:00.061
- Hey! Oh, easy.
- And you battle

23:00.110 --> 23:02.169
with everything you have,
and it doesn't matter

23:02.210 --> 23:06.101
if you're down the entire game.
All that matters is what
that scoreboard says

23:06.150 --> 23:09.119
when the buzzer sounds.
- Mm-hmm. Alright,

23:09.150 --> 23:11.789
this fictional scoreboard, what
does it say about our horse?

23:11.820 --> 23:14.152
- I'm gonna tell you the truth,
sometimes you have to draw

23:14.190 --> 23:16.988
a penalty in order to win the
game. You know what I mean?
- Give me that!

23:17.020 --> 23:20.558
Here, you take this. I'm gonna
go check on your colleague.
- No, no, I'm sure she's fine.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.967
Look, the real similarity
between investigating and hockey

23:26.000 --> 23:29.163
is that the only thing
that matters is...

23:29.200 --> 23:31.737
the speed at which
you get out and hustle.

23:31.770 --> 23:34.807
And especially what you do
when the clock is running out.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.183
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

23:52.230 --> 23:55.051
- All yours.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.091
- Thanks for the tea.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.708
- $3000

24:03.740 --> 24:06.208
on organic feed.
Blacksmith. Vet bills.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.175
Acupuncture?
- Yeah, it costs a lot
to keep an athlete going.

24:09.210 --> 24:11.974
- I thought you lived on
cheese puffs and energy drinks.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.978
- Hey, those were
after-game treats.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.113
Angie, meet Jules,
my too-smart daughter.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.584
You two have that in common.
- Hey, Jules. Sorry

24:18.620 --> 24:21.088
for taking over your kitchen.
- I didn't even know.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.213
One of the perks of being blind.
Nice to meet you.

24:23.260 --> 24:26.582
- You too.

24:26.630 --> 24:28.621
- It was great.
I joined the theatre club,

24:28.660 --> 24:31.527
so there's...

24:31.570 --> 24:33.595
You can say it.
- I just...

24:33.640 --> 24:35.267
I feel like I'm bringing home
a new bill every week.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.929
- Yeah, I feel like that too.
Kidding. It's fine.

24:38.970 --> 24:40.938
Wait a second,
additional fees.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.472
The vet bills.
There was one a month and
then last month, there were...

24:46.110 --> 24:48.078
- There's four.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.714
That's a pretty big discrepancy.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.286
- Yeah. Jules,
you're a genius.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.584
- As long as it's being used
for good and not evil.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.111
- Remember what Carly said.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.287
- Yeah, Diamond
didn't want to run.

25:05.130 --> 25:08.998
- I'm not gonna lie to you,
there is no poodle.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.258
- We want to talk to you about
Diamond Heist. You treated her

25:11.310 --> 25:13.005
four times this month.
- I can't discuss

25:13.040 --> 25:15.008
my client's property with you.
- Actually,

25:15.040 --> 25:17.133
we share the client.
The Cutlers hired us to

25:17.180 --> 25:19.978
investigate her disappearance.

25:20.010 --> 25:23.138
- I don't know
anything about that.
- Covering up an injury

25:23.180 --> 25:25.011
is grounds for losing
your license.

25:25.050 --> 25:27.280
- If you impede investigation,
it makes you an accessory.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.618
- You've been studying.
- Law and Order.

25:29.660 --> 25:31.821
But that accessory thing,
that's real.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.828
- Talk to Keith.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.293
Why?
- He told me

25:35.330 --> 25:37.195
to keep Diamond's condition
secret from the Cutlers.

25:39.130 --> 25:42.031
- Hardly. Diamond Heist
is three-months pregnant.

25:48.740 --> 25:50.879
- Champion racehorses

25:50.910 --> 25:54.038
don't just get knocked up.
It's not like this was a hookup

25:54.080 --> 25:56.048
after a school dance.
It was planned.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.844
- I'm cross-eyed.
There's so much tape.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.051
I just want to place Keith
at the track that night.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.022
- Wait a minute,
that's your mother.

26:05.060 --> 26:07.324
Looks like she lost.
- She always loses.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.089
- No, no, no. This was big.

26:09.130 --> 26:11.121
She's on the run.

26:11.170 --> 26:14.162
Bet you that bookie's
hot on her heels.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.601
- Nice call.
- Yeah, I've studied
a lot of game tape.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.767
You ever think
about giving her

26:19.810 --> 26:21.778
a second chance?
- I've given her

26:21.810 --> 26:23.641
a thousand second chances,
like that bookie.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.978
- You think we need
to worry about that?

26:26.010 --> 26:29.070
- When I was a kid, my mom used
to purposely get pulled over

26:29.120 --> 26:31.088
by the police.
She'd speed right by them

26:31.120 --> 26:33.008
to show me the way to talk
your way out of a ticket.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.052
- Sounds kind of bad ass.

26:35.090 --> 26:38.321
- It was kind of.
Until I got older

26:38.360 --> 26:40.920
and realized you can't live
your life that way.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.928
Rules are there for a reason.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.928
- I've seen you break
a rule or two.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.837
Maybe more of your mom
in you than you think.

26:52.170 --> 26:53.808
- It's Keith,

26:53.840 --> 26:55.808
Cutler's horse trainer.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.900
He's waiting for someone.
- Here she is.

27:00.850 --> 27:02.977
That's Bridget Cutler.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.953
- Money shot!
- Keith and Bridget.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.049
They were both there the night
Diamond Heist went missing.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.923
They both had access.
- Let's go to the ponies.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.224
- No, let's talk to Bridget.
We'll call and ask her

27:17.260 --> 27:19.228
to come in tomorrow.

27:19.270 --> 27:22.899
- Alright.
Then I'll just go home

27:22.940 --> 27:25.158
and skim my notes
before the test.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.360
- Sure! Yeah!

27:27.410 --> 27:30.948
I'm not worried._ _
- What are the four prinCIpal
methods of surveillance?

27:32.750 --> 27:35.173
Three types of evidence?

27:35.220 --> 27:37.040
The proper methods
for writing a report?

27:37.080 --> 27:39.139
One thing you
don't know about me, Everett,

27:39.190 --> 27:41.351
I am the master
of the final period.

27:41.390 --> 27:43.881
- Can't even learn the basics.
- I can.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.057
I have.

27:46.090 --> 27:47.990
I will?
- You know,

27:48.030 --> 27:49.998
millions of people read
a Raymond Chandler novel and

27:50.030 --> 27:51.998
think it would be cool to be
a P.I. But more to it than that.

27:52.030 --> 27:55.796
- I know that.
And I'm gonna rally.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.230
You're sure this is the right
test

28:01.280 --> 28:03.703
- Every time men fiddle

28:03.750 --> 28:06.048
with the balance of nature,
it's a disaster!

28:06.080 --> 28:09.174
- Men like Isaac Newton, Thomas
Edison and Stephen Hawking?
- Thanks, Mark. Enjoy the seats.

28:09.220 --> 28:11.188
- Or do you mean "disasters"
like penicillin,

28:11.220 --> 28:15.008
vaccination and the internet?
- OK, fine, alright. Anyway.

28:15.060 --> 28:18.223
I hear you, you make
a great point, alright?
But human cloning?!

28:18.260 --> 28:20.228
Who knows what
we're gonna end up with.

28:20.260 --> 28:23.195
- Or it could be a breakthrough
to the next stage of
human evolution.

28:23.230 --> 28:25.767
We can't let fear get in the way
of our advancements.

28:25.800 --> 28:28.030
- No, but--
- Scientific investigation

28:28.070 --> 28:30.038
and discovery have improved
our quality of life

28:30.070 --> 28:32.163
time and time again.
And that's why I believe

28:32.210 --> 28:34.474
that cloning is the next
logical step in our evolution.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.278
- Silence is victory, old man.
: Yeah.

28:39.310 --> 28:42.177
- I am straight-up prepared
for this debate. Thanks, Dad.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.882
- For my "Code."

28:44.920 --> 28:47.081
"There's no shortcut
to success," right?

28:47.120 --> 28:49.179
- Right.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.419
***

29:24.460 --> 29:26.781
- Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Cutler. I know

29:26.830 --> 29:29.253
this is inconvenient
on the day of the big race.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.098
- I don't understand --
why can't Jim be here?

29:32.130 --> 29:33.836
- The thing is

29:33.870 --> 29:36.065
we found something
involving you and Keith.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.534
I just
write his cheques.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.936
Is that
what the kids are calling it

29:40.980 --> 29:43.437
these days?

29:43.480 --> 29:46.142
7 You and Keith at the track the
night that Diamond went missmg.

29:46.180 --> 29:49.343
- We know Diamond was pregnant.
! How?

29:49.380 --> 29:51.348
- Well, sometimes
when a boy horse

29:51.390 --> 29:54.018
and a girl horse
like each other very much...

29:56.490 --> 29:58.287
- Keith confirmed the pregnancy
with your vet

29:58.330 --> 30:00.218
and then told him
to be quiet about it.

30:00.260 --> 30:04.026
- Keith wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't steal from me.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.959
- Or maybe you don't
know him so well.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.093
- I do. He's a good man,
and he cares about our horses.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.233
- I thought your horses
were just investments.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.568
- Not to me. Never.

30:13.610 --> 30:16.238
- We've seen Buddy.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.578
That horse nearly died.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.116
- I didn't...

30:22.150 --> 30:25.540
I didn't_realize until it was
too late. Jim was losmg money.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.512
He tried to recoup it
by over-racing Buddy.

30:27.550 --> 30:30.519
That's why I made him
hire Keith. I knew he would

30:30.560 --> 30:33.427
protect the horses.
- If Keith's so good,

30:33.460 --> 30:35.849
why is he your on

30:45.110 --> 30:47.305
We're running out of time.
Diamond Heist's race is up next.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.308
- So Keith is our Diamond thief.

30:49.340 --> 30:53.106
- Yeah, but did he
pull it off by himself?

30:53.150 --> 30:56.517
- Hey! Rumour on the track
is Diamond Heist was stolen.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.643
- Just keep walking.
- Sure is a shame.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.954
She's a beautiful filly,
and so many people came

31:00.990 --> 31:03.208
to see her run.
If only you had someone

31:03.260 --> 31:05.228
who knew something
about her disappearance.

31:05.260 --> 31:08.525
- Don't you ever get
tired of hustling people?
All I want is to finish

31:08.560 --> 31:10.653
this case, then we can go back
to not seeing each other,

31:10.700 --> 31:12.918
because that was really
working for me.

31:14.540 --> 31:18.169
- She's just
worried about the horse.
- She doesn't even like horses.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.235
But she's right
to say those things.

31:20.270 --> 31:22.238
I let her down
in a lot of ways.

31:23.980 --> 31:27.143
This is the race Diamond_Heist
was supposed to run in.

31:27.180 --> 31:29.444
- I guess Gold Coast
is gonna win after all.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.244
- I'm not so sure.
When he arrived yesterday,

31:32.290 --> 31:35.384
he bolted out of his trailer.
Looked real spooked.
Never a good sign.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.388
Are you sure?

31:37.420 --> 31:39.149
- Positive.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.249
- You're as beautiful
as your daughter.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.495
- Hey, that information
was not free!

31:45.530 --> 31:48.135
- So what happens
after she gives birth?

31:48.170 --> 31:50.138
Is she supposed to keep
pumping out babies

31:50.170 --> 31:53.207
until you get a champion?
- You got the wrong idea, Miss.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.674
I didn't steal Diamond Heist.
- No. You had a partner.

31:55.710 --> 31:58.645
Someone with access
to a stallion.
- Ivan Zickel.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.240
His tricked-out trailer
was here the night

32:01.280 --> 32:03.441
that Diamond disappeared,
but Gold Coast only arrived

32:03.480 --> 32:05.448
yesterday. Either
he was delivered

32:05.490 --> 32:08.379
twice or--
- Ivan used the trailer
to get Diamond out of here.

32:08.420 --> 32:11.025
I guess that proves
your theory that horses

32:11.060 --> 32:14.598
are more noble than people.
- You don't understand.

32:14.630 --> 32:18.168
Ivan's not my partner.
He blackmailed me.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.418
He found about me and--

32:20.470 --> 32:22.438
- He threatened
to tell Jim. I couldn't

32:22.470 --> 32:25.337
let that happen to her.
- And Ivan wanted a foal.

32:25.370 --> 32:28.407
- I helped get the horses
together. That was it.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.408
I didn't know anything
about a plan to steal her.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.340
- But once the pregnancy
was confirmed...

32:32.380 --> 32:34.268
- Ivan came in and took her.

32:36.350 --> 32:40.184
He made the same threat.
I stood by and watched her go.

32:40.220 --> 32:43.986
- I wish I knew.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.121
Next up, the. main event,

32:48.160 --> 32:50.549
the final race
of the Summerhill Derby.

32:50.600 --> 32:53.296
Jockeys, take your positions.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.461
- Great odds for Gold Coast
to win today

32:58.510 --> 33:02.105
now that Diamond
Heist is out of the race.
- He would have won against

33:02.140 --> 33:04.108
Diamond. It's probably why
the Cutlers pulled her.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.209
- Nice poker face.
We know you have her.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.571
- I'm sorry she isn't here.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.713
I loved watching them
run together.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.718
Imagine the progeny
those two could create.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.718
It would be a super-horse.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.285
: And they're on!

33:19.630 --> 33:22.758
- You know you can't hide
Diamond Heist forever.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.563
We're gonna find her.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.795
- It only takes one foal
to get a bloodline.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.163
After that, a mother
isn't really necessary.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.304
- But here comes Gold Coast!

33:32.340 --> 33:34.535
- You son of a bitch!
We know you took her.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.208
We will prove it.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.549
Keith is responsible
for Diamond Heist.

33:39.580 --> 33:43.141
He arranged the pregnancy and
told the vet to keep it
quiet. Come on!

33:43.180 --> 33:45.239
- Gold Coast takes the lead!
At the finish!

33:45.290 --> 33:48.259
It's Gold Coast by half a lane!

33:50.190 --> 33:52.181
I'm just a man with a horse.

34:03.270 --> 34:06.262
***
- Just because I still

34:06.310 --> 34:08.278
pull cable sometimes
for the phone company

34:08.310 --> 34:10.130
doesn't make me
your personal tech guy.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.546
- Dad, this guy Ivan
is a psychotic nerd,

34:12.580 --> 34:15.447
and we know how to stop him.
- He created an app called
Ping Squad. We know

34:15.480 --> 34:17.539
he's constantly tapped
into cellphone towers.

34:17.580 --> 34:20.140
- If we can get a history of his
pings we can find the location--

34:20.190 --> 34:23.387
- The location of the
horse, yeah. Cell phone
triangulation, I got that.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.854
It's the illegal part
that confuses me.

34:25.890 --> 34:28.199
- It's not illegal.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.568
Congratulations, son.
You've just crossed

34:31.600 --> 34:33.488
_ the line into
criminal behaVIour.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.498
You know, I think
I'm gonna use you

34:35.540 --> 34:37.496
as my argument against
human cloning.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.201
- Come on, Dad!

34:39.240 --> 34:41.401
Didn't you use to help
Angie's father

34:41.440 --> 34:44.705
back in the day?
- Bruce was a cop,
and cops have warrants.

34:44.750 --> 34:48.709
- Don, my Dad taught me
to play by the rules,

34:48.750 --> 34:50.809
but I've learned
that it's OK to break them

34:50.850 --> 34:54.115
if it's for the right reason.
- Once the foal is born,

34:54.160 --> 34:56.310
Ivan is gonna kill Diamond
Heist. She's the evidence.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.282
- If we can find her,
we can stop him.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.286
- That makes this
the right thing.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.198
- You two, you should be part

35:05.230 --> 35:08.165
of Jules's debate team.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.895
- Give me
this horse thief's number.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.601
I know a guy, I'll make a call.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.234
***

35:20.450 --> 35:22.714
- According to Ivan's
ping history, this is the place.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.194
- This is a crazy place
to hide a horse.

35:34.230 --> 35:36.198
- Crazy like a fox.

35:36.230 --> 35:38.198
It's abandoned,
it's nondescript,

35:38.230 --> 35:40.164
unexpected.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.361
- Unlocked.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.880
- Well.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.582
- Yeah.
- Can't say we didn't try.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.621
- Maybe your dad
was messing with us.

36:07.660 --> 36:10.254
- Yeah, I wouldn't put it past
him. One time when I was a kid--

36:10.300 --> 36:12.188
- Shut up!

36:12.230 --> 36:14.494
Do you hear that?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.531
- Over here!

36:23.540 --> 36:26.373
The wall!

36:26.410 --> 36:28.344
***

36:28.380 --> 36:30.348
Hey, girl!

36:30.380 --> 36:33.213
Hey, girl. Hey.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.354
You don't belong
in a place like this.

36:36.920 --> 36:40.526
- What do you say
we steal this diamond back?

36:43.700 --> 36:45.793
- Come on.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.821
You're a fraud.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.929
You don't really hate horses,
do you?

36:49.970 --> 36:53.007
- They're not the ones
that disappoint you.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.769
- Come on, girl.

36:54.810 --> 36:56.778
Come on, girl.

36:56.810 --> 36:59.347
Right here. Come on.
Come on. Come on, girl.

36:59.380 --> 37:01.871
There you go. Come on. This way.
- HEY!

37:01.920 --> 37:05.640
Is this really your plan?
Just to walk her out of here?

37:05.690 --> 37:08.579
- There's a 99% chance
he's gonna shoot you.

37:08.620 --> 37:12.488
- But only a 1% chance
he's gonna shoot the horse.

37:12.530 --> 37:15.249
- Come on! Ya!

37:15.300 --> 37:17.951
- No! Not the horse!

37:18.000 --> 37:19.968
Shade!
- Ya! Ya!

37:21.300 --> 37:23.632
Shade, get back here!

37:31.350 --> 37:32.942
- Whoa!

37:32.980 --> 37:35.540
Ah! Ah!

37:35.580 --> 37:38.378
- Stop! Stop!
Where are you taking her?!

37:38.420 --> 37:40.285
No,no,no!

37:40.320 --> 37:42.880
- Ugh! Argh!

37:42.920 --> 37:45.320
- Stop them!

37:45.360 --> 37:47.282
Stop them!

37:49.860 --> 37:51.293
- Darnnit!

37:54.800 --> 37:56.859
- Ah.
: Who is that?!

38:06.080 --> 38:08.913
: Ah! Ah!

38:08.950 --> 38:10.474
Ah! Ah...

38:10.520 --> 38:12.442
: Stop!
- As you can see, we had her,

38:12.490 --> 38:14.651
but then those guys
came out of nowhere.

38:14.690 --> 38:17.318
- Not judging by his reaction

38:17.360 --> 38:19.328
when she was driven away.
- Which was nothing compared

38:19.360 --> 38:21.419
to his reaction when he got
arrested an hour later.

38:21.460 --> 38:24.463
- You're the detectives;
who the hell are these guys?

38:24.500 --> 38:26.764
- The plates were covered
in mud. We ran the vehicle

38:26.800 --> 38:29.633
description through our police
contacts, but nothing came up.

38:29.670 --> 38:32.798
I'm so sorry.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.070
I thought she'd want
to hear this.

38:35.110 --> 38:37.078
- Bridget, uh,

38:37.110 --> 38:39.078
told me over breakfast
that she wanted a divorce.

38:39.110 --> 38:41.078
_ She walked out
With a couple of swtcases.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.613
- Women!
- You've had a rough week.

38:43.650 --> 38:45.641
- You have a gift
for understatement,

38:45.690 --> 38:47.646
Miss Everett.
- This report should be

38:47.690 --> 38:49.749
sufficient to make_an insurance
claim. The only thing remaining

38:49.790 --> 38:52.918
is the balance of our fee.
- No bonus,

38:52.960 --> 38:54.928
since you didn't return
Diamond Heist.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.928
- The bonus is
a satisfied client.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.995
Nice doing business
with you.

39:01.030 --> 39:04.500
- One more thing, and I don't
have a gift for understatement,

39:04.540 --> 39:07.361
your horse-racing days are over

39:07.410 --> 39:09.901
or this goes public.

39:22.090 --> 39:24.058
- Well, Saddleplay

39:24.090 --> 39:26.058
is gone from the app store.

39:26.090 --> 39:29.924
Apparently, it only had
a 13.3% success rate.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.599
Ugh!God!
Take it easy, will you?

39:32.630 --> 39:34.666
I bruised things
I didn't even know I had.

39:34.700 --> 39:37.863
- Next time, I ride the horse.
- So we're committed

39:37.900 --> 39:41.108
to a next time?
- Pass the exam, Shade.

39:41.140 --> 39:43.779
- Well, look who it is.

39:43.810 --> 39:46.108
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.175
- I'm sorry if I kicked you
too hard, man.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.417
- Over 600 games
of pro hockey, man.

39:50.450 --> 39:53.783
Toughest gig in the world 'til
I joined Everett Investigations.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.481
- Oh yeah.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.078
Come on.
***

40:00.090 --> 40:02.650
She will be giving birth
this summer;

40:02.700 --> 40:04.497
you should come back and visit.

40:04.530 --> 40:06.623
- We'd love to.
-Hmmm

40:06.670 --> 40:09.537
Well, she's really feeling
her oats today.

40:13.770 --> 40:16.500
OK, I gotta check
on my boys.

40:16.540 --> 40:19.145
Stay as long as you want, guys.
***

40:26.020 --> 40:27.988
- We did good, Everett.

40:28.020 --> 40:30.181
- Yeah, we did.

40:32.860 --> 40:35.055
-So

40:35.100 --> 40:38.490
I kind of made
a deal with your mom.

40:40.270 --> 40:42.761
- After she gave me the tip
on Gold Coast's trailer,

40:42.800 --> 40:44.802
she wanted something in return.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.138
- Ugh! How much
did you give her?

40:47.170 --> 40:50.207
- All she wanted
was coffee

40:50.240 --> 40:53.141
with you.
- No. No, not happening.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.614
- OK.

40:55.650 --> 40:57.971
You're not gonna pest me

40:58.020 --> 40:59.908
_ into it. _ _
- Hey, it's your deCI5ion.

40:59.950 --> 41:02.612
- Yeah, it is.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.628
- I'll just say this.
- Oh, here we go.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.628
- I know you may find this
hard to believe,

41:06.660 --> 41:09.094
but I haven't always been
the solid citizen

41:09.130 --> 41:11.098
you see standing
before you today.

41:11.130 --> 41:13.667
But I am trying to change.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.665
Maybe she is too.

41:25.210 --> 41:28.202
- ** Slowing down

41:30.180 --> 41:33.946
* I can see
you're slowmg down *

41:36.090 --> 41:40.026
* But I won't leave your side

41:40.060 --> 41:42.620
* I'm waiting for you

41:44.670 --> 41:46.558
* Ooooh

41:48.570 --> 41:52.666
* It too late for us to

41:55.680 --> 41:58.649
* Fall asleep

42:09.160 --> 42:11.116
: Stop cheating!

42:11.160 --> 42:13.128
- I'm not cheating.
- I can hear you putting

42:13.160 --> 42:15.219
your pieces on the table!
- It's an honest mistake.

42:15.260 --> 42:17.228
- Hey, guys!
- Sure it was.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.694
- Good.

42:19.730 --> 42:21.732
Jules, how was the debate?

42:21.770 --> 42:23.761
- I annihilated my competition,

42:23.800 --> 42:26.132
convinced the whole room
that cloning is a genius move.

42:26.170 --> 42:28.877
I was in the zone, Dad.
- Good. I'm very proud of you.

42:28.910 --> 42:31.799
- Uhhhh...

42:31.850 --> 42:33.704
Well, you know, sometimes

42:33.750 --> 42:35.672
you give it your best shot,

42:35.720 --> 42:37.676
but you still end up losing.

42:37.720 --> 42:40.086
: Oh.
- And other times,

42:40.120 --> 42:43.715
you win
by the narrowest of margins.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.625
- "54%."

42:45.660 --> 42:48.754
- But 100% PL
- I knew you had it in you, son.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.621
- To be honest, I thought
it could go either way.

42:53.770 --> 42:57.069
- * This is for the rest of us

42:57.100 --> 43:00.831
* Hoping it's all right

43:00.870 --> 43:03.134
- Here, let me put it
on the fridge for you.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.774
- No, you don't have
to do that.

43:05.810 --> 43:08.973
- * This is for the rest of us
- Unless you really wanted to.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.147
I mean, that would be

43:11.180 --> 43:14.115
such a place of honour
to have my test scores

43:14.150 --> 43:16.254
put on the fridge. Maybe
a little bit higher, honey.

43:16.290 --> 43:19.623
A little higher.
Yeah, maybe

43:19.660 --> 43:21.287
just a touch.
- * This is for the rest of us

43:21.330 --> 43:25.164
* Hoping it's all right

43:25.200 --> 43:27.725
* Old enough to die

43:27.770 --> 43:30.967
* And young enough to fight *

43:36.010 --> 43:37.875
