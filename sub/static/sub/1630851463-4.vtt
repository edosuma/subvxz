<i>Top Chef Family Style.</i>

00:10.468 --> 00:14.764
Welcome to the <i>Top Chef</i>
<i>Family Style</i>tailgate.

00:14.806 --> 00:18.643
Today's tailgate will be
a 100% plant based.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.603
Oh, my God,

00:21.021 --> 00:22.731
-These look good.
-Oh, yeah.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.693
Guys, Brooke's not doing well.

00:27.068 --> 00:30.321
Brooke is white as a ghost.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.491
And the winners are...
Eva and Jen.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.994
It's loaded with flavors.
So good.

00:36.411 --> 00:40.248
The chefs with the lowest
score are Kaj and Liz.

00:40.623 --> 00:43.460
However, we've just heard
from Brooke and Carol.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.086
They'll be leaving
the competition

00:45.128 --> 00:47.297
so you won't be going home.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.633
11 duos remain.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.093
I can't reach!

00:52.135 --> 00:53.345
Voila!

00:54.304 --> 00:57.265
At stake, $50,000

00:57.307 --> 01:00.060
and the chance to be crowned
the champions

01:00.101 --> 01:01.770
of <i>Top Chef Family Style</i>

01:01.811 --> 01:05.190
***

01:08.401 --> 01:11.404
That was crazy, it was hot.
A lot of people to feed.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.739
How are you guys feeling?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.491
Happy to be here
for another week.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.409
Yeah. Last week we did
really, really well.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.286
We made it in the top
of the wild card round

01:18.328 --> 01:21.623
and for the championship round.
I'm loving cooking with my dad,

01:21.664 --> 01:23.500
even though I yell
at him sometimes.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.877
Dad, what are you doing? Dad!
Do what you need to do.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.130
-Yes, boss.
-I need to chill out on that.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.133
Man, I hate that Carol and
Brooke aren't here anymore.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.135
That's a hard sight to see.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.470
Kaj, how are you feeling?

01:35.512 --> 01:37.430
That was a big sigh of relief.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.057
We're lucky to still be here.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.976
Even though I've worked in
a restaurant back home,

01:42.018 --> 01:45.647
<i>Top Chef Family Style</i>is a lot
harder than I expected.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.400
My wish for you today, Kaj,

01:48.441 --> 01:50.485
is that you get immunity
for your birthday.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.238
Happy birthday.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.989
That would be a good present.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.574
We need to prove to the judges

01:56.616 --> 01:58.910
that we can thrive
in this competition.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.037
Quickfire birthday, yeah.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.248
***

02:06.376 --> 02:10.171
-Hello.
-"Secret ingredient."

02:10.213 --> 02:13.967
-Oh, wow.
-Oh no.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.511
It's making me a little nervous.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.222
Chefs, please meet
our guest judge

02:19.264 --> 02:20.932
for this week's
quickfire challenge.

02:20.974 --> 02:25.228
James Beard award winning
pastry chef Sherry Yard.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.190
Sherry Yard is a really
good pastry chef.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.609
Seeing her
there is intimidating.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.320
Because I've burnt
boxed cookies before.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.322
You're not on my team anymore.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.657
Sherry, please tell us about

02:37.699 --> 02:39.159
these beautiful ingredients.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.660
Yes, we really do have

02:40.702 --> 02:42.746
a wonderful assortment
of ingredients here.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.123
Unfortunately, the items
you see here

02:45.165 --> 02:49.627
are the most commonly wasted
and discarded items of food.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.298
Food waste is a massive problem
in the United States.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.509
24% of food
goes to waste in America,

02:56.551 --> 03:00.055
and 40% of that is
wasted in our own homes.

03:00.096 --> 03:03.558
But the good news is we can
help reduce food waste

03:03.600 --> 03:07.604
by using up leftover food.
How do we do that?

03:08.229 --> 03:10.398
A pie contest.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.819
-Really? Pies?
-A pie contest?

03:14.861 --> 03:16.613
I have never made a pie before.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.991
You buy a pie. You make
dinner, you buy the pie.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.452
Pie is wonderful because
it's savory or sweet.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.829
So a pie is a perfect vessel

03:24.871 --> 03:27.207
for ingredients that might
otherwise go unused.

03:27.248 --> 03:30.794
***

03:32.212 --> 03:33.713
For today's quickfire challenge,

03:33.755 --> 03:35.799
you'll have one
and a half hours to make

03:35.840 --> 03:39.052
a pie using any of the
ingredients you see here.

03:39.094 --> 03:42.597
But there is one ingredients
that you must all use.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.933
-Oh, no.
-What's in the box?

03:44.974 --> 03:48.561
-What's in the box!
-Open that box!

03:48.603 --> 03:52.023
-One, two, three!
-What?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.275
-Oh!
-Mayonnaise?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.778
-In a pie?
-What?

03:56.820 --> 03:59.698
Hellmann's is committed to
reducing food waste.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.283
So, in that spirit, we can't
wait to watch you transform

04:02.325 --> 04:04.077
these commonly
wasted ingredients

04:04.119 --> 04:08.206
-into something delicious.
-Mayonnaise is eggs and oil.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.209
And in what might be the
ultimate kitchen hack,

04:11.251 --> 04:14.713
simply add Hellmann's to
your dough to achieve

04:14.754 --> 04:17.007
the perfectly flaky
golden crust.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.301
You can add the mayonnaise to
your dough or your filling.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.555
The chefs who make our
favorite pie will get immunity

04:23.596 --> 04:26.808
in the next round.
But that's not all.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.938
The winner will also receive
$10,000

04:31.980 --> 04:34.190
courtesy of Hellmann's
mayonnaise.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.110
What?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.361
No way!

04:40.739 --> 04:42.741
I want to win this,
I don't care about immunity,

04:42.782 --> 04:45.910
I just want the $10,000
that can buy me

04:45.952 --> 04:49.080
my food truck and that's been
my dream for ever.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.335
Ready!

04:53.376 --> 04:57.005
Chefs, your time starts now.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.631
Good luck!

04:59.883 --> 05:02.135
Oh, give me the green beans.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.055
Where'd the kid go?

05:06.848 --> 05:09.517
The eggs will give the dough
a little more stability.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.729
Is that right?
Making pie is difficult

05:12.771 --> 05:14.356
because you have to make dough
to make pie.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.775
I'm working on a filling,
you're working on the crust?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.526
-Yes.
-Baking is difficult for me.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.737
I think it's because it requires
such specific measurements.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.822
He has two math degrees.
It shouldn't be hard

05:22.864 --> 05:25.033
for him to measure things.
Somehow it is.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.870
The mayo is best used
in the crust.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.164
Okay, so boss, how we putting
this mayo in the pie?

05:31.206 --> 05:34.542
Put it in the crust because kind
of help it bind and everything.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.878
I'm not a pastry chef.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.630
What kind of pie
are you guys making?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.091
We're making an apple pie
with a caramel sauce

05:41.132 --> 05:43.009
and a vanilla bean
whipped cream.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.011
Wow. That's a lot of toppings.
Do you make pies often?

05:45.053 --> 05:46.971
I make them a lot and
then sell them.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.140
-Really?
-Baking is what I do.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.602
Back home, I have a little
baking business.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.062
I'm like looking at
all the other kids

05:54.104 --> 05:55.980
and half of them are
like freaking out

05:56.022 --> 05:57.774
because they have never
made pies before.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.402
-And I'm like, I got this.
-Behind!

06:00.443 --> 06:04.239
Adding pancetta into our dough.
Give it an extra flavor.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.282
Can you give me
some of that pancetta?

06:06.324 --> 06:10.286
Were blind baking pie crust,
which is when you bake

06:10.328 --> 06:13.957
the crust by itself before
adding the filling.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.084
-Crust in the oven.
-Listen to me.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.629
We have to sautÃ© the leek,
mushrooms,

06:19.671 --> 06:21.464
whatever's left in the fridge.

06:21.506 --> 06:26.094
We're inspired by our Sunday
brunches to make a potluck pie.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.805
-Love this pie, right bae?
-Yup.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.474
When I was younger, my dad,

06:31.516 --> 06:34.519
he was the one that cooked in
our house and I would sit

06:34.561 --> 06:36.771
on the counter and put
sauce in the pan.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.398
But then when I was
10 years old,

06:38.440 --> 06:41.401
he had a stroke and he kind
of lost that ability.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.654
So I started cooking
dinner every night.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.032
Although it changed our lives,

06:47.073 --> 06:49.784
it also brought us so much
closer as a family.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.995
We've got each other. It works.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.208
We got potatoes, onions.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.835
What are you guys making?

06:58.877 --> 07:02.380
Doing a potato, leek,
chicken soup pot pie.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.632
Like in the restaurant whenever
you guys have leftovers,

07:04.674 --> 07:07.552
-it goes into soup.
-That sounds really good.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.804
We're doing
a tropical paradise pie.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.141
We're using a lot of
fruit because fruit goes bad

07:13.183 --> 07:15.268
really quickly
and we'll stand out

07:15.310 --> 07:17.729
because I don't think I've ever
seen a tropical pie.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.356
This wasn't on.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.400
-No wonder it wasn't working.
-Look at that.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.527
You would've thought
we'd been making pies for years.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.988
-That's nice.
-During Thanksgiving,

07:27.030 --> 07:28.531
there's usually a sweet
potato pie.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.325
We gotta spice it
up a little bit.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.619
Throw some ginger in there.
We've never made this before.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.579
That looks beautiful,
though, man.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.581
-An hour and a minute!
-Already?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.542
The stuff you throw away,
usually it's like produce,

07:39.584 --> 07:41.336
so we can make like a
veggie spana--

07:41.378 --> 07:44.547
spanakato-- spanatapokia?
How do you say it?

07:44.589 --> 07:46.800
-Spanakopita. Yes.
-Spanakopita.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.010
They have the purple
sweet potato.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.804
Kind of sad
this is going to waste.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.681
I think we make a sweet potato
and haupia pie.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.766
Like a pumpkin pie
batter, almost.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.768
Oh, that would be good.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.812
-Stuff's cold.
-Ooh.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.980
Oh, my God.
It's like a science experiment.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.858
-I'm making ice cream.
-Oh, my God.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.902
Jack wanted to do
an almond ice cream

08:05.944 --> 08:07.862
to complement
the almond crumble.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.198
Oh! Do you use
liquid nitrogen like a lot?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.616
Heck no.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.201
You gotta take risks.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.329
Besides cooking, I'm also
a patented inventor

08:16.371 --> 08:18.164
and I have a business called
Treeting Cards.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.251
It's candy,
greeting cards together.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.752
-Boom.
-Go, Jack.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.338
Ever since he was little,
he had this fire in him.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.549
He just pushes himself
and he pushes himself.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.259
Oh!

08:29.300 --> 08:31.344
***

08:32.178 --> 08:35.765
My grandpa used to have a
butcher shop and whatever meat

08:35.807 --> 08:37.600
was leftover,
he used to grind it up

08:37.642 --> 08:42.564
using carrot peels, broccoli
stem to make a picadillo pie.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.399
It's like a beef pie.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.860
We're going to try to make a
roux with the broken tortillas.

08:47.402 --> 08:50.071
There you go.
Grandpa would love that.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.156
Yes.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.159
30 minutes!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.161
Back in the oven.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.248
Can you grab a big spoon?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.791
And smooth it out.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.587
This is amazing.
You guys are going down!

09:05.628 --> 09:07.255
[giggling]

09:07.297 --> 09:10.800
Delilah, look, this could be
used as an egg wash.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.054
-Look, it's going to be crispy.
-What are you guys doing?

09:14.095 --> 09:16.097
Putting mayonnaise
as an egg wash.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.058
Oh! Okay.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.435
I'm trying to perfect
the salty sweet.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.312
Let me taste it.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.566
-Pretty good?
-Oh! That is $10,000.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.277
My dad has sacrificed so much
to be here with me,

09:29.319 --> 09:32.489
like spending time with my
other siblings and my mom,

09:32.530 --> 09:34.407
his job, to do something that

09:34.449 --> 09:37.243
I love just shows how much
he got my back.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.289
-Man...
-We made those pies!

09:41.331 --> 09:43.416
* <i>We made those pies</i>*

09:43.458 --> 09:46.586
* <i>Pie it up, pie it up,</i>
<i>whippin' it, whippin' it</i>*

09:46.628 --> 09:48.505
Alright, hurry up.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.716
The crust baked off the thing
a little bit.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.593
Most of the crust was butter.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.971
We also have pancetta,
which is a fatty ham.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.974
There's a lot of oils
in that crust.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.018
Which causes it to shrink.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.270
Chefs, you have
five minutes left.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.981
We win this
amazing challenge yesterday,

10:07.023 --> 10:10.235
but today is a new day.
Here we go again.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.903
How are we going
to fix them now?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.989
***

10:20.954 --> 10:22.831
-It's looking good.
-Give me one of them.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.249
Let me press the top of that.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.292
-You have to press that down.
-I am.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.877
Filling up
the whole entire dish.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.671
I'm pressing it down.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.381
Don't burn yourself.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.675
I have yet to win a quickfire.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.968
I really want to win this one.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.345
Delilah, crispy, crispy, crispy.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.681
That was really smart
to do the egg wash.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.350
The crust problem
got sort of fixed.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.352
15 seconds!

10:46.813 --> 10:49.649
-It's done, done.
-Can you chill?

10:49.691 --> 10:51.943
Three, two, one!

10:51.985 --> 10:53.862
Time's up, hands up!

10:53.903 --> 10:56.698
-We killed that.
-Ah!

10:56.740 --> 10:58.366
-Kennedy.
-We made an apple

10:58.408 --> 11:00.201
-caramel crumble pie.
-Yes, you did.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.203
With vanilla bean whipped cream,

11:02.245 --> 11:03.913
caramel sauce drizzled on top,

11:03.955 --> 11:05.832
and there's also
a little miso in it.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.709
Dang, this is dirty.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.252
Yeah.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.754
And tell me about your crust.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.297
That's where I put
the mayonnaise,

11:12.339 --> 11:13.882
instead of adding more butter
than I would,

11:13.923 --> 11:16.217
-I just added mayonnaise.
-Okay, thank you.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.970
Hi, Milan. Can you tell us
about your pie, please?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.597
Today we have
a lemon meringue pie,

11:20.638 --> 11:22.057
as well as a homemade lemon curd

11:22.098 --> 11:23.975
with a little bit
of a caramel topping.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.894
-Wow.
-I really love the lemon.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.396
It screams freshness.
I would love the crust

11:28.438 --> 11:30.357
to have been cooked
a little bit more.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.108
I always say
the only thing blond

11:32.150 --> 11:34.152
in the bake shop
should be my hair.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.488
-Thank you.
-Good job. Jack.

11:36.529 --> 11:40.408
We did a rustic
rhubarb strawberry pie.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.869
-Look at this!
-And then almond ice cream.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.621
Our waste ingredients
were orange,

11:44.662 --> 11:47.415
-strawberry, and almond.
-How'd you make the ice cream?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.917
We used liquid nitrogen.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.543
You put a lot of work
into this dessert.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.712
Those flavors are exploding
in my mouth.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.799
Thank you so much,
Jack and Bobbie.

11:57.008 --> 11:59.010
We made a
"Tropical Paradise Pie."

11:59.052 --> 12:01.596
It's passion fruit curd,
mango coulis

12:01.638 --> 12:04.766
and coconut cold custard.
We put mayo in the curd.

12:04.808 --> 12:07.769
That makes it thicker. It adds
a little more saltiness as well.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.063
-Very nice.
-Thank you.

12:10.105 --> 12:14.234
So we made a sweet potato pie
with a ginger and pecan caramel

12:14.275 --> 12:16.444
and then
a bourbon vanilla whipped cream.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.904
-I love this artwork.
-That was something

12:17.946 --> 12:19.406
I helped with a little bit.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.116
-A little cinnamon dusting.
-Wow.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.617
I've never made a pie before.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.452
But the mayonnaise
I added inside the crust.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.579
And did you put a little salt
into the pecans?

12:26.621 --> 12:28.790
-Yes, chef.
-Great job. Thank you.

12:28.832 --> 12:32.043
So we made a picadillo pie,
or as we like to call it,

12:32.085 --> 12:33.878
"Everything But The Sink pie.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.089
And we put the mayonnaise
in the pie crust.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.008
And we also made it
as an egg wash.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.634
We also made our own roux

12:39.676 --> 12:42.595
-with the broken tortillas.
-Wow. Great job.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.974
-Good job!
-Hi Eva and Jenn.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.685
What we've done here
is a savory potluck pie.

12:48.727 --> 12:52.272
We have pancetta and scallion
in our dough.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.315
Lots of mushrooms,
garlic, shallots,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.484
all those things
in your produce drawer

12:56.526 --> 12:58.695
that you need to get rid of.
We've also added mayonnaise

12:58.737 --> 13:01.698
-in the pie crust.
-So how did you work today?

13:01.740 --> 13:05.618
Always crazy. Always yelling.
I'm a very emotional person.

13:06.369 --> 13:09.998
Today we made a Okinawan
sweet potato and haupia pie.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.500
It's topped with roasted
macadamia nuts

13:12.542 --> 13:14.169
and shredded coconut.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.047
-What's this crunchy stuff?
-Homemade toffee brittle.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.883
Thank you so much.
What's up Kiran and Moid?

13:19.924 --> 13:23.011
You have a spanakopita inspired
pie with a chimichurri

13:23.053 --> 13:24.679
but it's more of a vinaigrette.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.348
So it's like a chimi-grette.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.558
And there's mayo to bind it
in the actual filling.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.185
And then there's mayo
in the crust.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.770
This is my first time
making a pie.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.855
She literally wouldn't let
me touch the dough today.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.523
-Kiran's the boss today.
-Oh, no, always.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.192
[giggling]

13:37.233 --> 13:40.612
We made a potato and leek,
chicken soup pot pie.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.531
And it's New Orleans inspired
with some Cajun flavors.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.575
-I taste that.
-Thank you.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.121
Chefs, the best recipes
are made with love,

13:50.163 --> 13:51.623
and they're memorable.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.541
And today, you've created
some wonderful memories.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.378
Who made our least favorite
pies today?

13:57.003 --> 13:59.673
Eva and Jenn. I loved your
use of the mayo.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.342
Unfortunately, your crust
was under baked.

14:02.384 --> 14:05.261
-But flavors were mwah!
-Kaj and Liz

14:05.303 --> 14:07.222
Great idea with
the chicken pot pie,

14:07.263 --> 14:09.307
but the flavors didn't
come together.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.061
Anika and Anu, I loved the
tartness of your filling.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.438
The crust itself
was under baked.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.732
Who made our favorite
pies today?

14:17.774 --> 14:20.402
Khalil and Willie. Your shell
was cooked perfectly.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.904
Love the use of the pecans
over the top.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.864
Nice and salty with
that sweet touch.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.117
What's fascinating to me is
that you've never made

14:27.158 --> 14:29.661
a pie before. Well done.
Delilah and Danny.

14:29.703 --> 14:33.039
Garnish was incredible, crust
well cooked, the flavors popped.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.418
Loved the way you used all
your ingredients to complete

14:36.459 --> 14:38.169
the spirit of this challenge.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.963
-Thank you.
-Ocean and Jaydene.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.673
Good use of those ingredients.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.426
That crispiness of the brittle
on top. Well done.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.553
-Thank you.
-Good job.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.264
My heart dropped.
This was my challenge to win.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.683
And I didn't.
I'm just super mad.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.810
The winner of this challenge,

14:53.852 --> 14:56.312
gave us a pie that
was incredibly well cooked

14:56.354 --> 14:58.314
with wonderful flavors.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.820
Delilah and Danny.

15:03.862 --> 15:07.032
[applauding]

15:07.073 --> 15:09.200
Aw, look at her!

15:09.242 --> 15:12.620
Winning this challenge gives me
more confidence in myself.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.707
What are you going to use the
$10,000 for?

15:15.749 --> 15:19.252
-To go to culinary school.
-Bravo.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.255
I want to keep learning
how to cook.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.174
So you will head into
the next challenge

15:24.215 --> 15:26.259
with immunity and extra cash.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.219
Thanks to Hellmann's!

15:29.512 --> 15:31.973
Thank you so much, Sherry,
for joining us today.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.391
Thank you, everyone.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
-Thank you.
-Bye, Sherry!

15:35.643 --> 15:37.479
-Are you ready for more?
-Yes.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.482
Please welcome our guest judge
for our next challenge.

15:40.523 --> 15:44.694
***

15:45.945 --> 15:48.239
-Oh, it's a refrigerator.
-Hi!

15:48.281 --> 15:50.158
Please welcome
award winning chef

15:50.200 --> 15:52.660
and restaurant owner
Susan Feniger.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.579
[cheering]

15:54.621 --> 15:57.165
-I have something for you.
-Oh, thank you.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.667
Oh, thank you so much.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.252
-I was so cold.
-It's cold, isn't it?

16:01.294 --> 16:04.047
Susan, you can go ahead
and open the freezer.

16:06.383 --> 16:09.552
Surprise. There's nothing in it!

16:10.053 --> 16:11.971
I'm very confused.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.766
Isn't freezing like the
opposite of cooking?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.520
***

16:19.604 --> 16:21.314
For this elimination challenge,

16:21.356 --> 16:24.150
we want you
to fill up this freezer.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.860
And we're not looking
for leftovers.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.531
You must create an elevated
frozen meal.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.326
You'll put your dish
in the blast chiller

16:33.368 --> 16:35.370
where it will remain
until service.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.455
And then we're going
to take your food

16:37.497 --> 16:39.165
and we're going to put
it in the microwave

16:39.207 --> 16:41.251
and heat it up ourselves.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.044
Oh golly!

16:43.086 --> 16:44.838
It's going
to be really difficult

16:44.879 --> 16:47.215
to make a <i>Top Chef</i>worthy dish
while also having it

16:47.257 --> 16:48.717
be reheated in a microwave,

16:48.758 --> 16:50.552
because they make
everything a little too gummy.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.262
They just throw off the textures
and the taste

16:52.303 --> 16:53.888
of everything I cook.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.558
Frozen food when I was growing
up, not that great.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.560
But now they're really
wonderful.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.729
If you're making good food,
it doesn't need to be frozen.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.188
You just eat it.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.190
And that's why it's
a great challenge.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.942
What ingredients do you use
to make sure

17:05.984 --> 17:08.570
that it will reheat well
and still taste as great

17:08.611 --> 17:10.280
as though you're making
them fresh?

17:10.321 --> 17:12.490
I don't eat frozen meals.
I don't know how to make

17:12.532 --> 17:14.284
frozen meals, and I don't
know what to do.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.745
And I'm kind of stressing out.
I don't know if you can tell.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.414
At dinner tomorrow night, Susan,
Marcus and I will be joined

17:19.456 --> 17:21.583
by <i>Top Chef</i>alum Shirley Chung,

17:21.624 --> 17:24.419
who also has her own line
of frozen food.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.796
You'll menu plan tonight,
and tomorrow,

17:26.838 --> 17:29.257
you'll have one and a
half hours to cook.

17:29.299 --> 17:31.551
And before anyone
gets cold feet,

17:31.593 --> 17:34.971
-I'mma leave you to it.
-Bye, everybody!

17:35.847 --> 17:38.600
How do you like
freeze something, reheat it,

17:38.641 --> 17:40.769
-and it just doesn't overcook.
-I don't like it.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.771
Definitely
not a great challenge.

17:42.812 --> 17:46.441
Being in the bottom for the
first time in this competition,

17:46.483 --> 17:48.276
it's not a good feeling.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.779
So this just means redemption
in the elimination challenge.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.448
You know, we rise to every
challenge that we have.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.492
But I hate frozen food.

17:56.326 --> 17:57.827
Yeah.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.914
-Where are we making?
-Lasagnas, meatballs.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.540
I want to do pasta.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.876
Maybe, I think beef is a good
thing, right?

18:04.918 --> 18:07.462
With sauce, though. Something
that's gonna stay moist

18:07.504 --> 18:09.214
-and not dry out.
-Right.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.716
So I think something
Indian for this first dish.

18:11.758 --> 18:15.178
You always make
your Indian frozen food fries.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.971
When my grandfather
was really sick,

18:17.013 --> 18:19.349
my mom would go visit him in
India for a few months

18:19.391 --> 18:21.393
at a time. We really did miss

18:21.434 --> 18:23.061
the home cooked meals
that she would make.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.021
And so she would always
leave loads in the freezer.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.357
I was thinking <i>chatpata.</i>
<i>Chatpata</i>means like spicy.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.442
<i>Chatpata</i>chicken and rice.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.486
It's one of those classic
Indian dishes.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.656
But over the years, we've
really perfected ours.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.325
Kebabs heat up really well.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.494
I just don't want to keep
doing Pakistani food.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.996
But you're right,
this will heat up well.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.332
We really want to show
our range to the judges.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.626
But kebabs are the only
thing we have

18:46.668 --> 18:48.503
in the freezer that we
microwave and eat.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.839
I feel like kebabs is the only
option we have right now.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.717
And I really do not want
to be in the bottom three.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.845
We've been in the bottom of
every single challenge,

18:56.886 --> 18:59.639
and I'm kind of like maybe
we take a big risk

18:59.681 --> 19:02.225
and like hope it pays off.

19:02.267 --> 19:04.477
I make like slow
braised meat things

19:04.519 --> 19:07.772
and those definitely
freeze well and reheat well.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.858
A lot of people
are going to do that, though.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.610
I don't know if we need
to box ourselves

19:12.652 --> 19:14.487
into a certain protein.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.948
I don't know, dude. We have
a lot to think about.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.159
At the end of the day
we didn't decide

19:19.200 --> 19:20.702
what we're going to do yet.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.704
Dinner is going to
be a surprise!

19:28.960 --> 19:32.464
[upbeat music]

19:42.015 --> 19:44.684
We really need to win
this challenge, Mom.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.729
Or at least not
be in the bottom.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.773
I've been in the bottom
for so long now.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.941
We need to step up our game.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.985
Everyone here seems like such
a good chef.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.198
So, we better fight.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.325
We need onions for fried rice.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.120
-What are you guys making?
-Veg Manchurian,

20:04.162 --> 20:06.373
fried rice, and orange
black pepper chicken.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.957
Nice.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.293
Today we have to make an
elevated frozen meal.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.836
And I really want to show
the judges

20:11.878 --> 20:13.713
that we can do
something different.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.757
-It is a risk.
-I think we can do a twist

20:15.799 --> 20:18.635
on the orange chicken
by sautÃ©ing.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.804
Because frying gets it soggy.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.972
Yes. Normally orange
chicken is fried,

20:23.014 --> 20:25.308
but when it's frozen
and reheated,

20:25.350 --> 20:27.102
it's not going to regain
its crunch.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.020
Make sure you don't
overdo it, okay, Anika?

20:29.062 --> 20:32.315
So, we're doing sautÃ©ed version
of orange chicken.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.150
I think the judges
will appreciate

20:34.192 --> 20:36.027
that we have thought about it.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.822
No food waste

20:38.863 --> 20:40.657
Is that going
to be enough spinach?

20:40.699 --> 20:42.534
-Yeah.
-Kennedy, what are you making?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.160
Chicken pesto Florentine.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.705
-Where are you making?
-Beef bourguignon.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.748
Our dish evolved overnight.

20:48.790 --> 20:52.877
Probably a little more cream
than stock. Liz was right.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.838
Braised meat does great
when you microwave it

20:54.879 --> 20:57.841
and we're going to elevate it
by making cauliflower purÃ©e

20:57.882 --> 21:00.468
and bacon vinegar braised kale.
The thing I don't like

21:00.510 --> 21:02.554
about the pressure cooker,
you can't actually look inside.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.431
I have no idea what's going on.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.932
What are you guys making?

21:05.974 --> 21:07.851
We had to pull a little
bit of an audible.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.520
They didn't have goat, so we
had to switch over to lamb.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.022
But that'll still work.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.940
And then every great
Jamaican dish,

21:13.982 --> 21:15.692
a little bit of fried plantain.

21:15.734 --> 21:18.069
We grew up around
a lot of African

21:18.111 --> 21:19.487
and Caribbean influences,

21:19.529 --> 21:21.322
and those are some of our
favorite flavors.

21:21.364 --> 21:22.866
So we're going for it.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.035
All my Jamaican friends
tell me if you don't burn

21:25.076 --> 21:27.120
the curry, you're not
doing it right.

21:27.162 --> 21:29.456
-Here you go.
-What are you guys making?

21:29.497 --> 21:31.416
Gnocchi. Cool.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.626
It heats up well,
it tastes good.

21:33.668 --> 21:35.712
Hopefully, we'll wow the judges.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.214
Gnocchi is
a very detailed process,

21:38.256 --> 21:40.342
you have to make your dough,
roll it with the forks,

21:40.383 --> 21:42.385
you have to boil it,
make your tomato sauce.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.220
You have to do all this stuff.

21:44.262 --> 21:46.723
You remember making gnocchi
a year ago?

21:46.765 --> 21:48.350
I've only done gnocchi one time

21:48.391 --> 21:50.518
and it's really complicated
to do in 90 minutes.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.312
But this late in the
competition,

21:52.354 --> 21:53.897
you got to push yourself.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.690
Some of these are too small,
sugar.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.400
I think that's why
I started cooking.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.110
Because I hated frozen meals.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.988
-Well, and you hated my cooking.
-Yeah, but you've been good.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.158
We've gotta move
smidgey faster, okay?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.577
Are frozen foods common
in Alaska?

22:07.619 --> 22:10.747
Everything's frozen in Alaska.

22:12.957 --> 22:14.709
What's going on with
those short ribs?

22:14.751 --> 22:16.252
They need to get in here.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.672
My mom really wants
to do a short rib chili

22:18.713 --> 22:20.882
with Spanish
rice and corn pudding.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.676
And I'm on board with the idea

22:22.717 --> 22:24.594
because we eat left over short
ribs all the time.

22:24.636 --> 22:27.097
How much more time
on the short ribs?

22:27.138 --> 22:28.473
Not much.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.350
Getting the short ribs
tender enough

22:30.392 --> 22:33.186
in the time that we have.
This is my biggest concern.

22:33.228 --> 22:36.106
I need you to hurry there,
need your help on other things.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.858
Okay, I think that's should
be enough goat cheese.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.568
Maybe a little bit more.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.445
Delilah, what are you
making over there?

22:42.487 --> 22:45.615
A Chile... I can't pronounce it.

22:45.657 --> 22:47.409
-Relleno.
-Relleno.

22:47.450 --> 22:50.036
-With like cheese and shrimp.
-Didn't you win

22:50.078 --> 22:52.706
the last elimination challenge
using shrimp?

22:52.747 --> 22:55.959
-Yes.
-I'm happy that Delilah's

22:56.001 --> 22:59.671
coming out of her shell.
She's had a rough start.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.756
Other kids noticed
that she wasn't growing

23:01.798 --> 23:04.259
at the same rate
as her classmates.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.178
And so with that comes a
little bit of bullying

23:07.220 --> 23:09.472
and sometimes a bit,
"I don't wanna go to school."

23:09.514 --> 23:12.183
You guys did amazing. You should
feel so good about it.

23:12.225 --> 23:15.478
This competition has made
her really blossom.

23:15.520 --> 23:17.772
-Looks great.
-Thank you.

23:17.814 --> 23:20.942
She made friends
that share the same passion.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.736
She's having the time
of her life.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.612
-Is that the last one?
-Yep.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.656
Okay, make the salsa.

23:28.199 --> 23:31.995
Come on out. You're going to
get eaten. Come out of here.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.082
Tell me exactly
what we're doing.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.876
Braised beef,
with some mushrooms

23:37.917 --> 23:39.252
and scalloped potatoes.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.087
I have made this dish
a few times,

23:41.129 --> 23:43.340
but I've never frozen
this whole meal before.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.175
That's a lot of red wine.
You better not

23:45.216 --> 23:47.010
be taking any sips
of that on the side.

23:47.052 --> 23:49.095
-Only a little bit.
-What? No.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.056
Knowing this is going
to go into a freezer.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.516
I'm putting a lot more sauce
than normal because

23:53.558 --> 23:56.186
I will not let
this beef dry out.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.063
There we go.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.023
That's not enough sauce
for seven plates, right?

24:00.065 --> 24:02.025
It's just going
to be a drizzle on top.

24:02.067 --> 24:04.611
This isn't going to cover it,
so I think that's plenty.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.406
Whenever you're
breading something,

24:08.448 --> 24:11.743
there is a risk that when you
put it in a microwave,

24:11.785 --> 24:13.453
it's going to get mushy.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.663
So we decided to only use

24:15.705 --> 24:17.999
half the egg yolks
as a normal recipe,

24:18.041 --> 24:19.959
hoping that in the microwave,

24:20.001 --> 24:21.836
it stays fluffy
without becoming too dense.

24:21.878 --> 24:23.588
-It works.
-It works.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.800
-35 minutes.
-Are we done, Anika,

24:26.841 --> 24:29.135
with the chicken?
I'm trying my best

24:29.177 --> 24:30.970
to not show to her
that I'm panicking.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.056
Anika. Come here,
come to our station.

24:33.098 --> 24:35.350
Which I never knew about my mom,
I thought that

24:35.392 --> 24:38.436
she was always a calm person.
I'm just perfecting this.

24:39.187 --> 24:42.565
I think it should be good,
Anika. We have at this point,

24:42.607 --> 24:46.820
34 minutes left and are only
done with orange chicken.

24:48.822 --> 24:50.573
You know how to do
fried rice, right?

24:50.615 --> 24:52.367
-Duh.
-You've got to be kidding.

24:52.409 --> 24:54.828
You're taking too long on the
kebabs. If we don't get rice

24:54.869 --> 24:56.830
on this plate, I'm going
to be very upset with you.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.708
I'm not fully confident in
this dish, in any aspect.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.002
We are doing
a whole Indian meal.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.421
-So are we!
-Really?

25:04.462 --> 25:06.423
-An Indian off!
-We're making bihari kebabs.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.259
And I can't tell you the rest,
because you're copying me.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.678
I'm very stressed about
this time frame.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.805
And he's still working
on these kebabs.

25:13.847 --> 25:16.349
I'm sorry, Dad. I just
don't want the rice

25:16.391 --> 25:17.559
to be messed up.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.102
-Love you.
-I love you too.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.021
15 minutes.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.190
Holy moly, that looks amazing.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.734
Beautiful.

25:25.775 --> 25:28.319
[tense music]

25:29.988 --> 25:31.948
Can you work a little faster?

25:31.990 --> 25:34.325
Originally, we wanted to make
100 pieces of gnocchi,

25:34.367 --> 25:36.953
but Jack is really taking his
time with it to make sure

25:36.995 --> 25:38.788
his logs are perfect.

25:38.830 --> 25:40.707
And we realize as time
is winding down,

25:40.749 --> 25:43.501
we're not going to be able to
do that. Jack, we got to go.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.003
Okay, just do it.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.213
All right.
Well, it's all we got.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.008
***

25:55.305 --> 25:57.682
-What am I sprinkling this on?
-On the chilli, on the chilli.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.351
Let's just do a drizzle.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.062
I just don't want the red
pepper to be smothered on it.

26:02.854 --> 26:04.272
Okay, these look good.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.526
We may add more. I just want to
see how much we have.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.320
-One minute.
-Hurry.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.280
Stop screaming.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.408
[beeping]

26:15.825 --> 26:17.535
Yeah, we did it.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.870
I'm excited for this one.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.580
-Just looks good.
-I'd eat it.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.209
And where does it go?
In the freezer.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.879
-Put it in.
-Get that nice and frozen.

26:27.921 --> 26:31.174
-Put this in the blast chill.
-Right here.

26:34.552 --> 26:37.180
[upbeat music]

26:39.599 --> 26:42.310
-Wow, it's so cozy in here!
-Nice, right?

26:43.603 --> 26:46.064
-Look at this. Cozy.
-Ah!

26:46.106 --> 26:48.692
I'm excited to see what these
kids have done, right?

26:48.733 --> 26:51.194
A big part of my restaurant
business is frozen meals.

26:51.236 --> 26:54.114
So, we have to do a lot
of different R&D.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.574
This is a hard challenge.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.493
Oh, microwaves.

26:59.202 --> 27:03.206
-How is our food?
-Let's fire up the microwaves.

27:03.248 --> 27:04.833
-All right!
-Yeah!

27:04.874 --> 27:07.085
Give me some of that.

27:07.127 --> 27:09.921
I love the menu.
That is so cool.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.716
-Isn't it cute?
-Oh, fabulous.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.426
I'm ready to eat.
You ready to eat?

27:14.467 --> 27:15.719
Yeah!

27:15.760 --> 27:17.387
Let's get up and try some
of these.

27:17.429 --> 27:18.930
***

27:18.972 --> 27:20.890
-Okay, take a box.
-Thank you.

27:20.932 --> 27:22.517
-Take a box.
-Thank you.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.185
-Wow.
-Oh, wow.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.937
I got Kiran and Moid.

27:25.979 --> 27:28.231
-Kaj and Liz.
-Heat for three minutes.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.567
All right. Three minutes.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.904
Wow, that smalls good.

27:34.946 --> 27:37.282
Oh, my beautiful frozen dinner.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.910
So, we're starting
Kaj and Liz Beef Bourguignon.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.328
I love it.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.122
How about the presentation,
you guys?

27:44.164 --> 27:46.207
-That looks great.
-It's like tender.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.793
-Cauliflower.
-It's a cauliflower purÃ©e!

27:48.835 --> 27:51.171
-Oh, wow!
-Fluffy and creamy.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.631
Do you taste those greens, yet?
Those are great.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.467
I can't believe this was frozen.

27:55.508 --> 27:58.303
I'm so happy for Kaj and Liz.
This is a great round for them.

27:59.054 --> 28:00.805
Oh, you guys, this is so good.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.265
I wanna try ours.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.226
That looks bad.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.187
Oh, no.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.315
This is Kiran and
Moid's beef kebab.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.776
-Mm-hm.
-This smells great.

28:12.817 --> 28:15.445
-Just a little crumbly.
-It's a little dry, right?

28:15.487 --> 28:17.322
Lamb would have helped
that because

28:17.364 --> 28:18.990
the fat content would
have been different.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.575
The flavors are great.

28:20.617 --> 28:23.119
If Kiran and Moid had added
a little bit more sauce.

28:23.161 --> 28:25.497
It would have brought
the rice so it wasn't dry.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.999
-My food was bad.
-Your food was bad?

28:28.041 --> 28:29.751
It just wasn't great.

28:29.793 --> 28:33.922
Okay, so this is Eva and Jenn's
Short Rib Chili Dinner

28:33.963 --> 28:36.758
with Spanish rice
and Chipotle corn salad.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.176
-Wow.
-Love this flavor.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.803
They always come through
with the flavors.

28:39.844 --> 28:42.013
-I do want some chips.
-I was going to say that!

28:42.055 --> 28:44.432
-Where's my chips!
-I want chips!

28:44.933 --> 28:47.143
Oh, look at that drip. Oh, yeah.

28:47.185 --> 28:49.187
You know, Meghan is all
about the drip.

28:49.229 --> 28:51.898
-Wait, what are you all about?
-That bass.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.277
I really love
that fire roasted corn.

28:56.319 --> 28:58.947
It's sweet, it's crunchy
and goes with everything.

28:58.988 --> 29:02.158
They added sauce into it. So
that rice is really delicious.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.369
It is. I see a difference.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.205
-How does it taste, guys?
-The beef is perfect.

29:07.247 --> 29:09.791
And whoever did this corn,
kudos to you as well.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.460
I like it. I like it a lot.

29:12.502 --> 29:15.839
Anika and Anu did orange
and black pepper chicken,

29:15.880 --> 29:18.758
Manchurian curry
with fried rice.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.012
-Oh, they're rice is good, too.
-Oh, it's delicious.

29:22.053 --> 29:23.555
So they used dark meat,

29:23.596 --> 29:25.348
which is a great choice
for the protein.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.309
The breading
is kind of like soft.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.520
I don't think this is the
texture of chicken

29:30.562 --> 29:32.814
-that they meant to cook.
-Tastes good.

29:33.231 --> 29:36.234
-The orange chicken's good.
-I'm confident.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.653
-That has a great flavor.
-Thank you.

29:39.487 --> 29:40.905
Are we full yet?

29:40.947 --> 29:42.198
-No!
-Let's go!

29:42.240 --> 29:44.325
Yes All right.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.537
One, two, three, stop!

29:49.122 --> 29:51.124
I used to have restaurant
anxiety.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.960
I'm like, "What am I going to
order? Am I going to like it?"

29:54.002 --> 29:56.004
But I eat the same thing
every single day.

29:56.046 --> 29:58.173
This is opening my world.

29:58.631 --> 30:01.259
-Oh, they're done.
-They gotta be done now.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.636
All right. Well, let's try
Ocean and Jaydene's.

30:03.678 --> 30:07.015
Braised beef with scalloped
potatoes and vegetable medley.

30:07.057 --> 30:08.933
I love the look of the dish.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.602
They've got the fresh vegetables

30:10.643 --> 30:13.063
and they're not overcooked
and they're well seasoned.

30:13.104 --> 30:15.482
Now, it looks a little
bit skimpy.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.942
I have just one little bite
of carrot.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.361
You got a carrot?

30:19.402 --> 30:21.112
Yeah, one little carrot
right here.

30:21.154 --> 30:22.489
I didn't get no carrot.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.991
I think I have all
of your carrot.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.120
You know, with Ocean
and Jaydene,

30:29.162 --> 30:30.830
they're crushing it every round.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.540
For me, this was not their best.

30:32.582 --> 30:33.958
Yeah, same.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.170
And that shows you how
difficult this challenge is.

30:37.212 --> 30:39.422
-Yeah.
-It turned out pretty well.

30:39.464 --> 30:41.966
Everything held together better
than I thought it would.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.970
So Khalil and Willie made stewed
Jamaican curry lamb

30:46.012 --> 30:47.681
with saffron coconut rice,

30:47.722 --> 30:50.392
kidney beans,
and fried plantains.

30:51.142 --> 30:52.811
-Oh, my God.
-I'm happy.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.312
I feel like this is the vacation

30:54.354 --> 30:56.314
I've been
missing during all this time.

30:56.356 --> 30:59.442
Khalil and Willie, salt and
sweet pairing right.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.778
-Yes.
-It's got that spiciness.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.905
And just when it gets
a little bit hot,

31:03.947 --> 31:06.408
you go over to the plantain. Mm.

31:06.449 --> 31:09.703
Did you get the plantain? I
could eat that until I pass out.

31:09.744 --> 31:12.872
Jack and Bobbie's pan seared
gnocchi with pancetta,

31:12.914 --> 31:14.124
tomato red wine sauce.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.918
I mean, the flavor
of it all is great.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.587
The tomato sauce should
have been thinner.

31:19.629 --> 31:22.674
So when it goes into
the microwave,

31:22.716 --> 31:25.385
it doesn't all absorb and
become so dry.

31:25.427 --> 31:27.512
-Yeah.
-Have to get them points

31:27.554 --> 31:29.264
that they made fresh pasta

31:29.305 --> 31:31.391
for this particular challenge.
This is ambition.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.518
He's a good cook, but not just

31:33.560 --> 31:36.730
-the right choice of dish.
-Gnocchi. That's risky.

31:37.772 --> 31:40.483
Seeing the other
competitors' dishes,

31:40.525 --> 31:42.193
they have so much more
in their boxes

31:42.235 --> 31:44.195
and they have multiple
components to it.

31:44.237 --> 31:48.074
I'm not feeling so good. Shoot,
it doesn't look very good.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.792
-Milan and Chandrani.
-Fabulous.

31:57.834 --> 32:01.796
-Oh, Delilah and Danny.
-Oh, Chile Relleno. Alright!

32:01.838 --> 32:04.132
And Kennedy and Rosie.

32:07.635 --> 32:08.803
Start.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.307
-Good. I'm glad you like it.
-Can I take one?

32:12.349 --> 32:14.267
This is my first time
trying bacon.

32:14.309 --> 32:17.979
-Are you serious?
-At home, we cook vegetarian.

32:18.021 --> 32:21.316
-Do you like it?
-It's good. It's like smoky.

32:21.358 --> 32:23.651
I understand why people
like it so much.

32:25.737 --> 32:28.948
Kennedy and Rosie made
chicken pesto Florentine.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.825
It looks gorgeous.

32:30.867 --> 32:32.952
-Oh, my God.
-It's good, right?

32:32.994 --> 32:34.746
Does it need salt, though?

32:34.788 --> 32:37.665
Great concept. Florentine with
the mushrooms, bacon, spinach.

32:37.707 --> 32:39.459
But I hate to be
Debbie Downer, here.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.544
-Oh, gosh!
-Chicken breast,

32:41.586 --> 32:43.296
-I think the wrong decision.
-Yeah.

32:43.338 --> 32:44.964
It probably was cooked perfectly

32:45.006 --> 32:47.467
but then after we microwaved
it, the chicken breast

32:47.509 --> 32:49.552
needs a little help.

32:49.594 --> 32:52.681
-The moment of truth.
-Come, come, come.

32:52.722 --> 32:55.392
Milan and Chandrani
made <i>chatpata</i>chicken

32:55.433 --> 32:57.811
with saag paneer
and basmati rice.

32:57.852 --> 33:00.230
When you take a little
bit of the paneer,

33:00.271 --> 33:01.815
a little bit of the rice
and that sauce,

33:01.856 --> 33:03.733
-with the curry--
-You're taking all three?

33:03.775 --> 33:06.569
Just eat it together because
the sauce is kind of flat.

33:06.611 --> 33:08.738
Just an extra pinch
of salt in the curry,

33:08.780 --> 33:10.532
would really give me a little
bit punch.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.325
Then I think everything will
just become complex.

33:12.367 --> 33:13.868
And then that symphony

33:13.910 --> 33:15.829
starts playing all the
music and stuff.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.372
That was beautiful.

33:17.997 --> 33:21.042
I think it turned out really
well for being in a microwave.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.794
Delilah and Danny.

33:22.836 --> 33:27.424
They made cheese and shrimp,
stuffed Chile... reh-len-no.

33:27.465 --> 33:29.342
-Relleno.
-Relleno

33:29.384 --> 33:31.636
Cheese and shrimp
stuffed Chile--

33:31.678 --> 33:33.555
-Relleno.
-Ooh, relleno.

33:33.596 --> 33:35.849
Delilah and Danny
made cheese and shrimp

33:35.890 --> 33:38.393
-stuffed Chile relleno.
-[bell dinging]

33:38.435 --> 33:42.731
Cilantro lime rice
and tomato oregano sauce.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.358
They have immunity so
they can't go home.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.778
The tomato and oregano sauce
is actually really flavorful.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.865
And the green rice looks like
they fried the rice first

33:51.906 --> 33:53.908
and then added the green
sauce to it,

33:53.950 --> 33:56.953
-which is very traditional.
-I'm also impressed.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.663
It's stuffed with shrimp.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.540
Imagine you have to cook it
and then freeze it

34:00.582 --> 34:02.334
and then microwave it.

34:02.375 --> 34:04.836
And then the shrimp texture is
still great inside of this.

34:04.878 --> 34:07.130
-Oh, my God.
-I think like it.

34:07.172 --> 34:08.381
This is really good.

34:08.423 --> 34:10.175
When I first saw this challenge,

34:10.216 --> 34:11.885
I was scared for them.

34:11.926 --> 34:14.596
All this young chefs would be
able to execute like this.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.723
-I'm so impressed.
-Every single dish

34:16.765 --> 34:19.225
was over the top
and really delicious.

34:19.267 --> 34:22.812
And it was some of the best
frozen TV dinner I've ever had.

34:22.854 --> 34:25.357
-Yeah, me too.
-I'm going to go get the chefs

34:25.398 --> 34:27.400
and I'll meet you
at Judges Table.

34:28.610 --> 34:30.904
How do you guys think
the challenge went overall?

34:30.945 --> 34:32.405
It was not easy.

34:32.447 --> 34:36.076
The thinking process was
the hardest part.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.702
-Meghan!
-Meghan!

34:37.744 --> 34:39.120
Hi, guys!

34:39.162 --> 34:42.582
Well, thank you for feeding
us so much amazing food.

34:42.624 --> 34:44.876
We would like to see
the following chefs,

34:44.918 --> 34:46.961
Jack and Bobbie,

34:47.003 --> 34:48.421
Kaj and Liz,

34:48.463 --> 34:50.298
Delilah and Danny,

34:50.340 --> 34:52.342
Kiran and Moid,

34:52.384 --> 34:54.135
Eva and Jenn,

34:54.177 --> 34:56.554
Anika and Anu.

34:57.597 --> 34:59.307
Thank you so much.

34:59.349 --> 35:00.934
Bye.

35:00.975 --> 35:02.644
I don't want to go home!

35:02.686 --> 35:05.522
I'm kind of used to it now.
What am I? Four for four?

35:05.563 --> 35:08.441
I mean, you're ready.
It's my first time around.

35:08.483 --> 35:10.652
-Good luck guys!
-Good luck guys!

35:13.154 --> 35:16.324
***

35:22.288 --> 35:24.457
Out of all the challenges,

35:24.499 --> 35:26.835
I felt like this was
the toughest one.

35:26.876 --> 35:29.462
Frozen food and how
to elevate it.

35:29.504 --> 35:32.007
I'm extremely proud of you.
Well done, chefs.

35:33.258 --> 35:34.509
Delilah and Danny,

35:35.343 --> 35:37.053
Eva and Jenn,

35:37.095 --> 35:38.638
Kaj and Liz,

35:38.680 --> 35:40.390
please stay here,

35:40.432 --> 35:42.350
the rest of you can
step to the side.

35:45.770 --> 35:49.024
You chefs are standing
here because...

35:51.943 --> 35:54.029
you made our favorite
dishes of the night.

35:54.070 --> 35:56.614
Congratulations!

35:57.532 --> 36:00.035
[cheering]

36:00.076 --> 36:03.830
-Congratulations.
-Jenn with the tears.

36:07.834 --> 36:09.544
This was a crazy challenge.

36:09.586 --> 36:11.463
I feel like a miracle
that we're here.

36:11.504 --> 36:13.673
The rice was delicious.

36:13.715 --> 36:16.217
The chili was a really
smart decision

36:16.259 --> 36:20.013
because it was layered.
Every bite was exciting.

36:20.055 --> 36:22.891
-How did you cook the short rib?
-We braised it

36:22.932 --> 36:25.643
and then we pressure cooked it
in a mirepoix.

36:25.685 --> 36:27.354
I'm never afraid to try
your meals because

36:27.395 --> 36:30.148
I know they're going to feel
like the greatest hug

36:30.190 --> 36:33.401
in the entire world. And this
was a beautiful hug.

36:34.152 --> 36:37.364
When you guys hit all the
gears in your repertoire,

36:37.405 --> 36:39.532
you produce
really delicious food.

36:39.574 --> 36:41.826
-Thank you all.
-So, Kaj,

36:41.868 --> 36:44.537
this competition has
been a little bit up and down.

36:44.579 --> 36:46.664
-Yeah.
-But I know there's

36:46.706 --> 36:48.625
a really, really good cook
in there.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.543
He's an eternal optimist.

36:50.585 --> 36:52.879
He's like the best person
here to be

36:52.921 --> 36:55.006
at elimination four weeks
in a row.

36:56.341 --> 36:59.052
The way you guys plated it,
there was a purpose.

36:59.094 --> 37:02.555
The juices fell in to the
beautiful cauliflower puree.

37:02.597 --> 37:04.641
Your spicy kale
with bacon vinaigrette

37:04.683 --> 37:06.726
is really the highlight
of your dish.

37:06.768 --> 37:08.687
The kale is kind of something
that we do

37:08.728 --> 37:10.313
a lot in New Orleans.

37:10.355 --> 37:12.899
It has the spice and the
acid and the sweetness,

37:12.941 --> 37:14.734
which is like the kind of
flavors that I like.

37:14.776 --> 37:17.195
It cuts through all the
richness and bring out all

37:17.237 --> 37:19.572
the creaminess at
the same time. Great job.

37:19.614 --> 37:21.449
-Thank you.
-Danny and Delilah,

37:21.491 --> 37:22.909
because you had immunity
this week,

37:22.951 --> 37:24.536
how did that factor
into your cooking?

37:24.577 --> 37:26.204
Even if we didn't have immunity,

37:26.246 --> 37:27.664
we still would've made this dish

37:27.706 --> 37:29.499
because it really represents
our culture.

37:29.541 --> 37:33.044
That dish was
really executed well.

37:33.086 --> 37:35.296
I thought the green rice
was perfectly seasoned.

37:35.338 --> 37:38.049
Putting shrimp inside
the Chile relleno,

37:38.091 --> 37:41.594
you executed it perfectly.
After reheating,

37:41.636 --> 37:45.348
the shrimp is still perfectly
crunchy and nice and sweet.

37:45.390 --> 37:47.350
-Very impressed.
-Thank you.

37:47.392 --> 37:50.603
The chefs who made
our favorite dish today

37:50.645 --> 37:52.772
did an incredible job at keeping

37:52.814 --> 37:56.609
the integrity of taking a dish
from fresh to frozen

37:56.651 --> 37:59.988
and then reheating.
The winning chefs are...

38:00.030 --> 38:04.951
***

38:05.535 --> 38:08.580
-Kaj and Liz.
-Yes!

38:08.621 --> 38:11.166
[cheering]

38:11.833 --> 38:14.336
It's super exciting,
it's our first win,

38:14.377 --> 38:16.796
and we really needed this.
We almost got eliminated.

38:17.172 --> 38:18.965
-And now we're at the top.
-Well done.

38:19.007 --> 38:21.676
This is the best
post-birthday present there is.

38:21.718 --> 38:25.138
[cheering]

38:25.180 --> 38:26.973
I'm so happy for you.

38:27.015 --> 38:30.101
This week, I've learned that
if we really work as a team

38:30.143 --> 38:32.479
and collaborate well, we can
put out some really good dishes.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.857
Congratulations, Kaj and Liz,
and to all of you.

38:35.899 --> 38:37.734
And you can all step
to the side.

38:37.776 --> 38:39.235
-Good job.
-Thank you.

38:39.277 --> 38:40.987
The others, would you
please step forward?

38:41.029 --> 38:43.365
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

38:43.907 --> 38:46.910
I'm sorry. You had our least
favorite dishes tonight.

38:46.951 --> 38:50.246
That means that one team here
will be going home.

38:50.288 --> 38:53.041
***

38:58.338 --> 39:00.965
Kiran and Moid, tell us
about your dish today.

39:01.007 --> 39:03.593
Honestly, we were worried about
the rice being too dry

39:03.635 --> 39:05.804
or the kebab not reheating well.

39:05.845 --> 39:07.806
When we tasted it before
it was frozen,

39:07.847 --> 39:09.891
it all kind of tasted good.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.352
How you plate your dish really
makes a big difference.

39:12.394 --> 39:15.063
If you have red pepper sauce,
drizzled over it,

39:15.105 --> 39:17.440
all this flavor
would meld together

39:17.482 --> 39:20.235
and then also add moisture
to everything else, too.

39:20.276 --> 39:22.028
I told my dad
when we were plating

39:22.070 --> 39:24.072
that I wanted to add more sauce

39:24.114 --> 39:25.990
and he didn't want
that much sauce.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.826
Because you picked beef,
it goes dryer.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.828
They needed to be coated
with sauce.

39:31.329 --> 39:33.832
Jack and Bobbie, you had the
chance to try this food.

39:33.873 --> 39:35.709
What was your honest
opinion of it?

39:35.750 --> 39:39.629
I misjudged
the proportion size, and...

39:42.257 --> 39:44.426
Jack, just because
you can make something,

39:44.467 --> 39:47.303
doesn't mean you should
make it at that challenge,

39:47.345 --> 39:51.766
because when you're going
to heat, freeze, reheat,

39:51.808 --> 39:53.935
there's a chemical reaction
that happens.

39:53.977 --> 39:56.354
When sauce reduces,
it becomes thick.

39:56.396 --> 39:59.607
You need that moisture to be
able to keep that gnocchi,

39:59.649 --> 40:01.359
so it stays delicate.

40:01.401 --> 40:02.944
We did our Parmesan on top

40:02.986 --> 40:04.821
for like when it reheated,
hopefully

40:04.863 --> 40:06.656
the parmesan would
malt onto the gnocchi.

40:06.698 --> 40:09.325
You know, when they melted, it
would re-moisturize the gnocchi

40:09.367 --> 40:11.411
but it didn't look like
it was enough.

40:11.995 --> 40:14.831
How did the challenge go for
you, Anika and Anu?

40:14.873 --> 40:17.083
When I tasted
the Manchurian curry,

40:17.125 --> 40:18.960
my thought was a little
like floury.

40:19.002 --> 40:22.464
It didn't eat clear.
When they both are doughy,

40:22.505 --> 40:25.925
all we could taste was that
flour combination.

40:25.967 --> 40:28.094
That just is not that delicious.

40:28.136 --> 40:30.472
-Yes, chef.
-Also, when we tasting

40:30.513 --> 40:34.392
this two sauces together, it
almost tastes very identical.

40:35.518 --> 40:37.145
Chefs, we have a lot to discuss.

40:37.187 --> 40:38.938
Please head back to the rec room

40:38.980 --> 40:40.690
and we'll call you
when we're ready.

40:43.234 --> 40:45.945
It's up to fate at this point.

40:45.987 --> 40:48.698
Guess who's in the bottom again!

40:49.532 --> 40:51.326
-What happened?
-Kaj won.

40:51.368 --> 40:52.911
Congrats, Kaj.

40:52.952 --> 40:56.122
[cheering]

40:56.915 --> 40:59.209
So, who's on the bottom?

40:59.250 --> 41:02.504
-Me.
-Kiran, Jack, Anika, and Anu.

41:02.545 --> 41:05.799
Definitely, like being there,
you had a lot to soak in.

41:05.840 --> 41:08.009
Yeah, it's good that
we got feedback.

41:08.051 --> 41:11.012
Who had the toughest time
fulfilling the challenge today?

41:11.054 --> 41:14.140
With Anika and Anu,
their big mistake

41:14.182 --> 41:18.019
was the two types of flours.
But keeps giving us flavors.

41:18.061 --> 41:19.854
It didn't quite work,

41:19.896 --> 41:21.564
but they challenged
themselves more

41:21.606 --> 41:25.110
with three different dishes
and interesting technique.

41:25.151 --> 41:27.028
-Yes.
-Even if it was all mush,

41:27.070 --> 41:29.197
it was my favorite mush
of the day.

41:29.239 --> 41:31.366
Anika told me earlier
only that it's tasting

41:31.408 --> 41:33.576
a little bit doughy.
And I said, "No, I tasted it.

41:33.618 --> 41:34.786
I found it okay."

41:34.828 --> 41:36.996
So, maybe she got it right.

41:37.038 --> 41:40.875
Jack and Bobbie.
The sauce was not enough.

41:40.917 --> 41:43.044
The portion was way small.

41:43.086 --> 41:46.673
But they really tried
to elevate that dish.

41:46.715 --> 41:49.968
The gnocchi that is handmade
was really delicious,

41:50.010 --> 41:51.970
but it didn't get enough sauce.

41:53.096 --> 41:54.681
Kiran and Moid. For me,

41:54.723 --> 41:56.975
the elevation was not there.
Because of the rice

41:57.017 --> 42:00.228
was separated
and then the kebab was dry.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.063
How dry it was, I could tell,
like,

42:02.105 --> 42:03.648
here's my frozen meal
of the day.

42:04.274 --> 42:06.234
They need more sauce
on the kebab.

42:06.276 --> 42:09.112
We've been in the bottom three
times now. This is not fun.

42:09.738 --> 42:11.823
Alright, well,
I think we have our decision,

42:11.865 --> 42:14.325
so let's bring them back in.

42:14.367 --> 42:17.454
***

42:18.329 --> 42:22.125
Today, you all served
us delicious food

42:22.167 --> 42:24.085
and you made it really hard

42:24.127 --> 42:26.379
for the judges. Meghan.

42:26.421 --> 42:31.009
***

42:32.135 --> 42:34.262
Kiran and Moid. I'm sorry,

42:34.304 --> 42:36.389
you must pack
your knives and go.

42:37.766 --> 42:41.603
It was a pleasure to cook with
guys. I'm happy I got to learn.

42:41.644 --> 42:43.229
You're amazing. You both are.

42:43.271 --> 42:46.608
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

42:46.649 --> 42:48.485
Thank you, guys.

42:50.570 --> 42:52.947
-Bye, guys.
-Oh, no!

42:55.075 --> 42:56.868
-I'll miss you, Kiran.
-I'll miss you too.

42:56.910 --> 42:59.329
Being on <i>Top Chef Family Style</i>
has been a dream come true.

42:59.371 --> 43:01.289
Being here just really shows
I'm a good chef.

43:01.331 --> 43:04.084
-I made it to the second branch.
-Yeah, you did.

43:05.752 --> 43:08.296
I'm glad that we're able to
spend so much time together

43:08.338 --> 43:10.965
and support her in
her culinary dreams.

43:11.007 --> 43:12.342
Yeah.

43:12.384 --> 43:15.053
-Bye, guys.
-Good luck, everyone.

43:15.470 --> 43:17.597
That restaurant that we open
some day is going to be

43:17.639 --> 43:20.141
an even better restaurant than
it was before we got here.

43:20.183 --> 43:21.935
I had so much fun cooking
with you,

43:21.976 --> 43:23.395
and I'm going to have
way more fun

43:23.436 --> 43:25.313
cooking with you in the future.

43:27.065 --> 43:29.442
Next on <i>Top Chef Family Style</i>

43:30.443 --> 43:32.153
For this elimination challenge,

43:32.195 --> 43:34.698
you'll be highlighting
sustainable seafood.

43:34.739 --> 43:36.491
It's time to sink or swim.

43:37.242 --> 43:40.537
And you'll be splitting
into three teams.

43:40.578 --> 43:43.540
Someone can go home
for someone else's fall.

43:44.708 --> 43:47.293
I got to get this thing
fully scaled.

43:47.335 --> 43:49.129
Bloody stuff coming through.

43:49.170 --> 43:50.672
I love our team, it's so
happy and helpful.

43:50.714 --> 43:54.092
Going in. Anika's sauce
needs some help.

43:54.134 --> 43:56.094
Oh, no. It's split now.

43:56.136 --> 43:58.513
Oh my goodness.
We're in the ocean.

43:58.555 --> 44:01.266
This would be a successful
dish on <i>Top Chef.</i>

44:01.307 --> 44:03.309
I'm going to need
a birth certificate.

44:03.351 --> 44:06.771
That broth was watery.
You have to taste, taste, taste.

44:06.813 --> 44:09.232
They were put into
a really difficult position.

44:09.274 --> 44:10.942
How do you send them home?

44:10.984 --> 44:13.111
This is the toughest decision
we've ever had to make.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.529
