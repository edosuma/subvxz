00:00.838 --> 00:03.838
<b>1x18 - Ben Again</b>

00:08.839 --> 00:11.607
Seriously?
Your name is "Eon"?

00:11.643 --> 00:13.609
Like "ee-yawn"!

00:17.241 --> 00:20.583
Your juvenile taunts
won't save you, Ben Tennyson.

00:20.619 --> 00:23.856
<i>Save me from what?
You can't even lay a finger on me!</i>

00:23.891 --> 00:26.929
I don't have to.
Time is on my side.

00:33.909 --> 00:37.174
What?
No weird "time beams" or whatever?

00:37.209 --> 00:39.576
Not your usual style, Eon.

00:39.611 --> 00:46.122
The only thing ever predictable
about me is that I'm unpredictable.

00:46.158 --> 00:50.530
Unpredictable, but lame!
Now this is a sword.

00:58.443 --> 01:01.478
Aha!
Just what I was waiting for!

01:08.388 --> 01:12.458
I don't know what that was all
about, but now it's my turn!

01:37.492 --> 01:39.927
What is with you,
new Omnitrix?

01:39.962 --> 01:42.663
First you won't transform me
into the aliens I ask for.

01:42.698 --> 01:45.632
Now you're transforming
yourself to look all retro?

01:45.668 --> 01:48.936
Dude, you better still work.

01:48.971 --> 01:50.838
Ditto? Wow!

01:50.873 --> 01:56.111
I haven't used Ditto since...
forever!

02:01.252 --> 02:02.051
Where'd he go?

02:02.086 --> 02:04.320
I don't suppose we
pummeled him into oblivion?

02:04.355 --> 02:06.455
<i>Eh, whatever, man.
At least we got rid of him!</i>

02:06.491 --> 02:08.725
Score one for the little guys!

02:08.759 --> 02:12.629
All right! Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

02:12.664 --> 02:17.167
Ben!
- Gwen? Why are you ...

02:17.202 --> 02:21.038
A little kid?

02:21.073 --> 02:23.675
Why am I a little kid?!

02:23.710 --> 02:27.080
What's with your voice?
You sound even weirder than usual.

02:27.115 --> 02:28.648
This isn't me!

02:28.683 --> 02:31.785
I mean, it is me, but
it's me a long time ago!

02:31.821 --> 02:33.187
I'm a teenager now!

02:33.222 --> 02:36.391
Easy, Ben. You must've
taken a clonk to the noggin.

02:36.426 --> 02:37.659
It was Eon!

02:37.694 --> 02:40.796
You mean Eon
clonked you on the noggin?

02:40.831 --> 02:44.066
No!
He sent me back in time somehow!

02:44.102 --> 02:45.902
Or sent my brain, anyway.

02:46.872 --> 02:48.772
Your brain's definitely gone
somewhere.

02:48.807 --> 02:50.574
Ben might be right, Gwen.

02:50.609 --> 02:53.577
You said it yourself ...
he doesn't sound like our Ben.

02:53.613 --> 02:55.913
Then where is "our" Ben?

02:55.949 --> 03:00.653
Wherever he is, poor little
"me" must be totally freaking out...

03:00.688 --> 03:03.689
Awesome!

03:03.725 --> 03:07.194
Grandpa, check it out!
I'm a teenager!

03:07.229 --> 03:09.630
Ben?
What is wrong with your voice?

03:09.666 --> 03:12.366
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

03:12.402 --> 03:15.870
Easy, Ben.
You must've taken a clonk to the noggin.

03:15.905 --> 03:17.428
<i>Interesting.</i>

03:17.429 --> 03:20.475
A full temporal consciousness inversion.

03:20.510 --> 03:24.713
Not the effect I was going for, but it
should still have the desired result.

03:24.748 --> 03:27.516
You're still here?
I'll fix tha...

03:28.119 --> 03:31.555
New Omnitrix?
Sweet!

03:31.590 --> 03:36.326
Are all these aliens
really mine? Best day ever!

03:36.362 --> 03:40.530
Where is Paradox?!
- Pair-o-who?

03:41.867 --> 03:43.901
The time-travelling busybody who

03:43.936 --> 03:47.071
shows up whenever you make
a mess of the timestream.

03:47.106 --> 03:51.742
Never heard of him, dude.
- Oh, of course not.

03:51.778 --> 03:55.480
You haven't met Paradox yet.
He'll go to the other one.

04:00.854 --> 04:04.991
<i>So, if you're really
from the future, what's it like?</i>

04:05.026 --> 04:08.028
What am I like?
- You...

04:08.063 --> 04:11.098
are actually pretty cool.
I miss you a lot.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.900
Miss me?

04:12.935 --> 04:15.469
Am I dead?
I'm dead, aren't I?

04:15.504 --> 04:18.038
No! No!
You just went to college.

04:18.074 --> 04:20.440
Early, in fact.
You're doing great.

04:20.476 --> 04:23.344
I go to college early?

04:23.379 --> 04:27.348
No more spoilers, Ben.
Time travel is tricky business.

04:27.383 --> 04:30.284
The less we know about
the future, the better.

04:30.319 --> 04:34.322
<i>Ah, wise words, indeed!</i>

04:34.357 --> 04:36.358
<i>Professor Paradox?</i>

04:36.393 --> 04:39.228
What's with the steam-punk
makeover?

04:39.263 --> 04:41.730
Let's just say I've
been forced to take a more

04:41.766 --> 04:43.999
active role in
temporal affairs of late.

04:44.035 --> 04:48.170
It's become open warfare on the
space-time continuum, I'm afraid.

04:48.205 --> 04:53.075
A time war?! Is it bad
that I think that sounds awesome?

04:53.110 --> 04:57.079
Uh, Ben, you want to
introduce us to your friend here?

04:57.114 --> 05:01.150
Oh, my apologies.
I can see I have you at a disadvantage.

05:01.185 --> 05:03.753
Or I will have had
you at a disadvantage.

05:03.788 --> 05:06.823
Time travel makes verb
tenses so confusing.

05:06.858 --> 05:11.428
I am professor Paradox, for
ironic reasons we needn't go into.

05:11.463 --> 05:13.863
Ben, a word.

05:13.899 --> 05:17.133
I'm not sure how much
time we have, so listen carefully.

05:17.169 --> 05:19.603
Eon wants nothing less than
absolute power over

05:19.638 --> 05:23.807
everything ... all timelines, all
alternate realities ... everything.

05:23.842 --> 05:26.243
But you know how to stop him.

05:26.278 --> 05:28.011
Yes and no.

05:28.047 --> 05:31.348
I've managed to trap Eon here in
this timeline only.

05:31.384 --> 05:34.552
He can travel to the past
or the future freely but

05:34.553 --> 05:37.721
he's powerless to access
any alternate realities.

05:37.756 --> 05:39.490
That's good?

05:39.525 --> 05:42.960
Yes, but the key to
his escaping this timeline is my

05:42.995 --> 05:46.263
Chrononavigator, and he'll
stop at nothing to get it.

05:46.298 --> 05:48.098
Chrono-what-with the
who now?

05:48.133 --> 05:50.100
My pocket watch, of
course.

05:50.135 --> 05:52.902
Think of it as a GPS for the multiverse.

05:52.938 --> 05:57.040
I've taken great pains to
camouflage it for safekeeping.

05:57.075 --> 06:00.042
You must keep the
Chrononavigator out of Eon's

06:00.078 --> 06:04.647
hands at all costs.
Do you understand?

06:04.682 --> 06:08.785
The Chrononavigator ...
give it to me, timewalker!

06:08.820 --> 06:11.554
You know very well
that is never going to happen.

06:11.590 --> 06:14.625
Then I'll just
have to take it from you!

06:20.097 --> 06:25.501
No, Ben!
This not your fight!

06:25.537 --> 06:27.493
Do what you will, Eon.

06:27.494 --> 06:31.407
You'll never get your hands
on the device you seek.

06:31.442 --> 06:34.910
Time will tell.
- Don't worry, Ben!

06:34.946 --> 06:39.381
I'm sure you have the important
matters well in hand!

06:44.721 --> 06:46.688
"Well in hand..."

06:48.457 --> 06:52.060
This place is so cool!
What does this thing do?

06:52.095 --> 06:55.563
I wouldn't touch that.

06:55.599 --> 06:58.399
Or that.
- How about this one?

06:58.434 --> 07:00.067
Definitely not that.

07:00.103 --> 07:02.703
Please, Ben, if you
would just sit still so we can

07:02.739 --> 07:04.438
figure out what is wrong with you...

07:04.474 --> 07:08.242
There's nothing
wrong with me. I'm awesome!

07:08.277 --> 07:10.577
There's obviously
something wrong with him.

07:10.613 --> 07:12.313
He's not himself.
He's...

07:12.348 --> 07:16.050
Where is he?
- Oh, not again.

07:16.886 --> 07:22.790
<i>- Core Jettison in 10, 9, 8...
- Ben!</i>

07:22.825 --> 07:26.695
<i>6, 5, 4, 3 ...</i>

07:28.731 --> 07:32.933
So, uh, got any
games on this thing?

07:32.969 --> 07:36.771
I'm gonna need you to look
after Ben until we figure out what to do.

07:36.807 --> 07:38.907
My apologies,
Magister Tennyson.

07:38.942 --> 07:40.909
I have barely learned to deal
with teenage Ben.

07:40.944 --> 07:43.278
Is there anyone else
who has experience in dealing

07:43.313 --> 07:46.214
with this version?
- I do.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.334
So, mentally, he's 11?

07:53.370 --> 07:55.937
Gwen?
Is that really you?

07:55.972 --> 07:58.940
You look...
like you're still a dweeb!

07:58.975 --> 08:01.142
And you're still a doof...

08:01.177 --> 08:03.311
Easy, Gwen.
Don't let him get to you.

08:03.346 --> 08:05.580
You're above this childish stuff now.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.682
Nyah-nyah,
nyah-nyah, nyah!

08:07.717 --> 08:10.351
I still do not
understand why you are here, Gwen.

08:10.387 --> 08:13.555
Five years ago, Ben
told me to come and find him at

08:13.590 --> 08:15.456
this exact date and time.

08:15.492 --> 08:18.225
I almost didn't do it, but he
seemed so serious.

08:18.261 --> 08:22.296
It wasn't like him at all.
Well, not like 11-year-old him.

08:23.132 --> 08:24.999
It wasn't me!
No, really.

08:25.034 --> 08:28.202
That wasn't me, Gwen.
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:28.237 --> 08:31.938
You don't suppose his
16-year-old mind got sent back

08:31.974 --> 08:34.227
into his
11-year-old body?

08:34.229 --> 08:37.611
Some kind of cross-time brain swap?

08:37.645 --> 08:39.546
But wouldn't we
remember that?

08:39.582 --> 08:41.982
I mean, I remembered him
asking me to find him.

08:42.017 --> 08:44.183
I don't know.

08:44.220 --> 08:47.354
This time-travel stuff always
gives me a headache.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.089
Do you recall anything else?

08:49.125 --> 08:51.892
Only that I'm supposed
to take him to Mr. Smoothy's.

08:51.928 --> 08:55.262
Mr. Smoothy's?!
Gross!

08:57.500 --> 09:00.768
<i>You are a timid fool, Paradox.</i>

09:00.804 --> 09:03.437
Just because you never
took full advantage of the

09:03.473 --> 09:06.774
Chrononavigator's power
doesn't mean I shouldn't.

09:06.810 --> 09:09.977
Yes, but in anyone
else's hands but mine, it could

09:10.013 --> 09:12.781
cause irreparable
damage to the timestream

09:12.782 --> 09:15.549
or destroy all of time
and causality itself.

09:15.585 --> 09:19.454
In any event, I couldn't possibly
give you the Chrononavigator,

09:19.455 --> 09:23.323
even if I wished to do so,
because I don't have it.

09:23.359 --> 09:26.660
Hmm.
No, you don't, do you.

09:26.695 --> 09:30.564
You are many things, Paradox,
but a liar you are not.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.367
Precisely.
Now, if you'd be so kind as to

09:33.403 --> 09:36.403
loosen these shackles,
I shall be on my way.

09:36.438 --> 09:42.242
What's the rush?
We have all the time in the world.

09:46.714 --> 09:51.684
"Well in hand..."
this thing must be important to

09:51.720 --> 09:54.587
finding the Chrono-whatchamacallit.

09:54.622 --> 09:57.757
Man, doesn't Paradox ever get
tired of being cryptic?

09:57.792 --> 10:00.126
Are you ever gonna tell
me what you're being cryptic

10:00.161 --> 10:03.329
about, doofus, or are you just
gonna keep muttering to yourself?

10:03.364 --> 10:07.199
I wish I could, Gwen.
I could really use your help right now.

10:07.235 --> 10:09.502
You're always good at figuring
out stuff like this.

10:09.537 --> 10:12.505
And stop doing that!
- Stop doing what?

10:12.540 --> 10:14.941
Being so... nice!
It's creeping me out.

10:14.976 --> 10:17.076
Sorry.
- You're still doing it!

10:17.111 --> 10:19.645
Sorry.
- You're doing it again!

10:19.680 --> 10:21.380
Gwen, I need a favor.

10:21.415 --> 10:24.517
Maybe the most important
thing I'll ever ask you to do.

10:24.552 --> 10:27.787
Five years from today,
you have to find me, no matter

10:27.822 --> 10:31.524
where I am ... even if I'm on
another planet or something.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.892
Five years?

10:32.928 --> 10:37.096
Exactly five years,
to the day and time.

10:37.131 --> 10:43.469
Come find me and take me to...
um... Mr. Smoothy's.

10:43.505 --> 10:47.273
You hate Mr. Smoothy's.
- That's why it's perfect.

10:47.308 --> 10:50.577
Make me go with you. I'll explain
everything to you then, I hope.

10:50.612 --> 10:53.780
Can you do that?
Promise me. Please?

10:53.815 --> 10:55.982
Wow.
Politeness overload.

10:56.952 --> 10:58.018
Okay.

10:58.053 --> 11:01.955
Thanks... dweeb.
Now stay here.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.558
I need to take care of
something.

11:04.593 --> 11:06.894
Mr. Smoothy's?

11:06.929 --> 11:09.062
Believe it or
not, you love this place.

11:09.098 --> 11:11.199
It's true.
We used to hang out

11:11.200 --> 11:13.300
here all the time ...
you, me, and Kevin.

11:13.335 --> 11:17.671
<i>- Kevin who?
- Kevin Levin.</i>

11:17.706 --> 11:19.439
No way!

11:19.474 --> 11:23.042
Now I know this is some freaky
alternate messed-up universe!

11:23.077 --> 11:27.379
Kevin changed! He's a
good guy now ... a really good guy.

11:27.415 --> 11:33.752
Wait. You're not...
you and Kevin 11?

11:34.889 --> 11:38.490
That's even more gross than
Mr. Smoothy's!

11:42.394 --> 11:44.329
Well, you have brought him here.

11:44.364 --> 11:45.764
Now what is supposed to happen?

11:45.799 --> 11:47.566
I don't know.
Ben didn't tell me.

11:47.601 --> 11:49.568
Maybe you should ask Kevin 11.

11:49.603 --> 11:52.337
Maybe you should stop
being such a doofus!

11:52.372 --> 11:55.573
Dweeb!
- Maybe I will scan the area.

11:55.608 --> 12:00.144
Hey, a sumo slammers
sticker! That's my favorite one.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.981
Etched right into
the metal. What could do that?

12:03.016 --> 12:03.748
Ben?

12:03.784 --> 12:06.251
Don't look at me.
I didn't put it there.

12:06.286 --> 12:09.621
I think you did.
Or you're going to have done.

12:10.457 --> 12:13.692
Paradox is right ... time travel
makes verb tenses so confusing.

12:13.727 --> 12:17.963
Paradox? You mean the
guy that Eon dude was looking for?

12:17.998 --> 12:20.099
You saw Eon?!

12:20.134 --> 12:22.969
<i>You had to have used the
Chrononavigator to get to young</i>

12:23.004 --> 12:28.107
Tennyson, so what did you have then
that you don't have now?

12:28.143 --> 12:31.344
Clever.
Very clever.

12:31.379 --> 12:33.613
Nothing
gets by you, does it?

12:33.648 --> 12:36.248
Now that I know the
answer, I'll simply return to

12:36.284 --> 12:38.851
the moment I severed
your hand and retrieve it.

12:38.886 --> 12:41.687
With two time
travellers already there?

12:41.722 --> 12:43.621
Plus Ben's "condition"?

12:43.657 --> 12:46.758
You are well aware that the
fabric of space-time is already

12:46.793 --> 12:50.094
stretched dangerously thin at
that particular moment.

12:50.129 --> 12:54.431
If you go back there now, you
could cause a rupture and be

12:54.467 --> 12:56.900
lost outside of time altogether!

12:56.936 --> 12:58.335
Hmph.

12:58.370 --> 13:01.838
That is true.
But there is another way.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.079
There appears to be something
else on this vertical structure.

13:08.114 --> 13:12.183
Where?
- Where?

13:12.219 --> 13:14.186
I got this.

13:19.926 --> 13:20.659
Anything?

13:20.694 --> 13:26.165
There's some numbers
up here: "35.35-118.96"

13:26.200 --> 13:30.569
and some crazy, made-up word ...
Armodrillo?

13:30.604 --> 13:34.240
35 point...
they are map coordinates...

13:34.275 --> 13:37.043
of the old abandoned sewer
system under Bellwood.

13:37.078 --> 13:40.880
Let me guess ...
abandoned five years ago.

13:40.916 --> 13:44.451
Now it is right in the
middle of undertown.

13:44.486 --> 13:47.487
What's undertown?

13:53.561 --> 13:56.196
<i>Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, you don't!</i>

13:56.231 --> 13:59.065
<i>There will be no destroying of
Pakmar's place today!</i>

13:59.100 --> 14:01.434
Ben Tennyson is not welcome here!

14:01.469 --> 14:03.302
Whoa.
Chill out, little guy.

14:03.338 --> 14:06.539
Mr. Pakmar, sir, we
just need access to the basement.

14:06.574 --> 14:07.707
Plumber business.

14:07.742 --> 14:10.976
I assure you no harm will come
to your establishment.

14:11.912 --> 14:14.713
Pakmar has heard that one before.

14:17.584 --> 14:19.017
This is the place.

14:19.053 --> 14:21.854
So that "armo-drillo"
thing's here somewhere.

14:21.889 --> 14:24.790
Armodrillo is one of
your aliens.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.074

14:36.103 --> 14:40.740
<i>- You had to tell him?
- Hey, check it out!</i>

14:40.775 --> 14:43.743
<i>There's more numbers down
here on this pipe I just hit.</i>

14:43.778 --> 14:45.945
<i>One ... oh...</i>

14:45.980 --> 14:46.846
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

14:56.455 --> 15:00.524
<i>Pakmar will send you
the bill. Again.</i>

15:00.560 --> 15:03.927
There are more coordinates,
all right ... not far, either.

15:03.963 --> 15:06.630
So you think our Ben
left these clues for this Ben

15:06.666 --> 15:09.166
five years ago?
Why would he do that?

15:09.201 --> 15:12.302
Why not do it?
It's like a treasure map or something.

15:12.337 --> 15:16.239
I'm a genius!
But what did I hide for me?

15:16.274 --> 15:20.610
I guess we'll just have to
keep following clues until we find out.

15:45.837 --> 15:48.105
You're sure these are the right
numbers?

15:48.140 --> 15:50.373
Abso-tively,
posi-lutely!

15:50.409 --> 15:56.026
There must be a mistake.
Why make us drive all over town ...

15:56.027 --> 15:59.617
and undertown ... following
clues, just to lead us back here?

15:59.652 --> 16:01.018
It's crazy.

16:01.053 --> 16:03.854
It's brilliant!
Nobody would ever think to look

16:03.889 --> 16:07.557
for something hidden at the
start of a treasure map!

16:08.593 --> 16:11.828
Well, when you put it that way,
it is kind of brilliant.

16:17.268 --> 16:20.136
This looks like a job
for that drillorama guy again.

16:27.044 --> 16:28.844
Sorry!
Sorry to scare you!

16:28.879 --> 16:32.114
It's all good, people.
Go back to your Smoothy's.

16:32.149 --> 16:33.015
Yuccha.

16:33.050 --> 16:34.916
I didn't see any more numbers in there.

16:34.952 --> 16:38.086
But look what I found inside the wall!

16:38.121 --> 16:41.156
Bzw! Bzw! Bzw!

16:41.191 --> 16:43.358
So... what is it?

16:46.829 --> 16:51.600
Merely the key to
dominion over all space and time.

16:51.636 --> 16:55.905
And thanks to you, it is now mine!

17:07.393 --> 17:10.862
It's amazing.
Every timeline, every alternate

17:10.896 --> 17:14.699
reality ... I can see them all,
and they're all mine!

17:14.733 --> 17:18.102
Eon, I am so gonna clean
your clock.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.843
Arctiguana?
Cool! Literally.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.823
Ben?
- No worries, Gwen.

17:39.858 --> 17:43.560
I finally got an alien I know
how to use!

17:47.798 --> 17:49.498
Done and done!

17:49.534 --> 17:52.434
Oh, but there's more
where that came from.

18:05.348 --> 18:08.918
The holes in time ...
they're not closing!

18:14.391 --> 18:16.126
Gwen?
- What?

18:16.161 --> 18:19.496
Not you. Her!

18:19.531 --> 18:24.668
<i>Ben? Is that you?
And is that me?</i>

18:24.703 --> 18:26.303
<i>Careful, children!</i>

18:26.338 --> 18:31.108
<i>Crossing over the time warps can
have disastrous consequences!</i>

18:31.143 --> 18:35.413
What is this,
timewalker?! You tricked me!

18:35.448 --> 18:38.749
<i>On the contrary, I
warned you.</i>

18:38.785 --> 18:44.021
<i>Stop this now or all of
existence will be destroyed!</i>

18:44.057 --> 18:47.792
No!
If I cannot rule the cosmos,

18:47.827 --> 18:51.328
then I will be the one to destroy it!

18:56.369 --> 18:58.135
The hand ... where is it?

18:58.170 --> 19:01.237
<i>Well, duh!
The evil bad guy has it!</i>

19:03.608 --> 19:09.412
"Well, duh!"
Then Wildvine's gonna take it back!

19:15.486 --> 19:21.458
Hey, leave him ...
me ... alone!

19:21.493 --> 19:23.627
Rook, you take care of
any stragglers.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.863
I'll take... me...
and try to free Paradox.

19:26.898 --> 19:28.832
<i>Me?
But I can't ...</i>

19:28.867 --> 19:32.169
Yes, you can. It's an
energy-siphon counterspell ...

19:32.204 --> 19:36.373
Combibo potentia. But we both
have to do it at the same time.

19:37.243 --> 19:42.512
<i>Okay, if you ... I ... say so.</i>

19:42.548 --> 19:46.784
<i>- Combibo potentia!
- Combibo potentia!</i>

19:47.319 --> 19:51.288
We did it! I
mean, I did it. I mean...

19:51.323 --> 19:54.657
<i>Same thing.</i>

20:05.602 --> 20:09.204
Professor Paradox?
We're open to suggestions here!

20:09.240 --> 20:13.342
<i>You must anchor Eon
to your respective time zones!</i>

20:13.377 --> 20:17.646
<i>- I would suggest clockwork!
- I don't have clockwork!</i>

20:17.682 --> 20:18.781
Ah.

20:18.816 --> 20:25.354
<i>Well, if activated at the same moment,
your two Omnitrixes might synchronize.</i>

20:25.389 --> 20:28.290
<i>"Might"?
Some professor you are!</i>

20:28.325 --> 20:32.227
<i>Well, it's
better than "won't."</i>

20:32.263 --> 20:34.163
One...
- Two...

20:34.198 --> 20:36.164
Three!
- Three!

20:53.651 --> 20:54.951
It worked!

20:54.986 --> 20:57.720
Wait. No.
I'm still in the wrong me.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.657
Without Eon to
anchor them, all the separate

21:00.692 --> 21:03.927
eras of time are progressively
snapping back into place.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.229
<i>Which means in a few
seconds, none of this will have</i>

21:06.265 --> 21:08.164
<i>happened, and we won't remember a thing.</i>

21:08.200 --> 21:11.234
You really are
getting quite good at this,

21:11.270 --> 21:16.105
young master Tennyson.
Pity you'll have to start over.

21:16.141 --> 21:19.175
<i>Good seeing you...
me... again.</i>

21:19.210 --> 21:21.757
Yeah, me, too.

21:26.658 --> 21:31.622
Is it just me, or does this day
seem to be dragging on and on?

21:31.657 --> 21:34.091
I almost wish some
universe-threatening calamity

21:34.127 --> 21:36.260
would occur to alleviate this boredom.

21:36.296 --> 21:39.097
Yeah, well, something's
bound to happen sooner or later.

21:39.132 --> 21:42.634
It always does.
Just give it some time.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.908
Ben!
Where's Paradox?!

21:49.944 --> 21:53.479
The Chronosapiens have gone
rogue, and Maltruent's temporal

21:53.514 --> 21:56.248
beasts are on a
cross-dimensional rampage!

21:56.284 --> 21:59.185
This time-war is getting out of hand.

21:59.220 --> 22:02.422
Time-war?
Awesome!
