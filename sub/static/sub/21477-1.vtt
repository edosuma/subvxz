01:30.897 --> 01:33.720
- How was last night?
- Yeah, good times.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.722
- You doing okay today, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:35.802 --> 01:38.396
- Smart to come?
- Yeah. Gotta keep the peepers open.

01:38.476 --> 01:39.789
You know...

01:39.873 --> 01:42.011
You know what? I'm just glad
to be back on friendly shores.

01:42.091 --> 01:44.896
- Preach.
- Nothing like winters in the Hindu Kush.

01:44.976 --> 01:46.280
Man.

01:47.582 --> 01:49.437
Proximity alert.

01:49.985 --> 01:51.829
Back to work.

01:52.888 --> 01:54.537
No fucking way.

01:54.617 --> 01:57.648
All right, people. We're on the clock.
Stack up and move out. Double-time.

01:57.728 --> 02:00.404
- Let's go.
- Move, let's go.

02:01.032 --> 02:03.240
Come on, let's go, move!

02:04.834 --> 02:06.393
O'Neill.

02:07.173 --> 02:09.744
Alex. Stack.

02:12.176 --> 02:13.753
Ready?

02:18.050 --> 02:19.928
Help me.

02:25.494 --> 02:27.349
Who's there?

02:27.669 --> 02:29.222
Damn it.

03:07.976 --> 03:11.001
<i>I'm going to beat you! Oh, God!
I'm hurting! I'm hurting! I'm hurting!</i>

03:11.151 --> 03:13.168
- Doing good, kiddo!
- You're so slow!

03:13.248 --> 03:17.059
Here comes papa bear! Here comes papa bear!

03:18.122 --> 03:21.546
You'd better start speeding up!
You'd better start speeding up!

03:22.076 --> 03:24.281
- Daddy! I can't stop!
- Danielle, use your brakes!

03:24.361 --> 03:26.952
- Danielle! Brakes! Danielle!
- Daddy!

03:27.032 --> 03:29.354
- Brake!
- Help me!

03:29.434 --> 03:30.978
Danielle!

05:15.691 --> 05:18.385
Hey... Isaac.

05:19.296 --> 05:21.306
I could have killed you.

05:24.368 --> 05:26.211
Sorry, I'm...

05:27.103 --> 05:29.125
...been preoccupied.

05:30.305 --> 05:32.314
I understand better than most.

05:32.394 --> 05:34.638
All right, so what broke?

05:35.482 --> 05:38.736
- That obvious?
- Yeah. After all these years? Yeah.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.070
Well, we lost contact with site nine.

05:41.150 --> 05:44.646
- Who's inside?
- Thomas, Rainier, Alex...

05:45.026 --> 05:48.205
...O'Neill, Tilson.

05:49.630 --> 05:53.305
- Any alarms, distress calls?
- Quiet as a church mouse.

05:53.385 --> 05:55.792
And the feed was clean before it cut off.

05:55.872 --> 05:58.486
No, no, no, Langley can remote-access that.

05:58.566 --> 06:01.705
We tried that. Completely offline.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.723
Temples don't go offline.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.674
- But no system is perfect, Gabriel.
- Mine is.

06:09.754 --> 06:11.630
It has to be.

06:12.974 --> 06:14.851
But your boys need your help.

06:16.662 --> 06:18.172
I need your help.

06:39.521 --> 06:41.525
He got him.

06:47.565 --> 06:49.115
Hey, Riley.

06:52.437 --> 06:55.126
- It's nice to see you.
- You, too.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.416
We weren't the same without the big brain.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.268
Sorry I didn't return your messages.

07:01.348 --> 07:03.716
You have nothing to apologize for.
Glad your back.

07:03.796 --> 07:07.112
Thank you. It's nice to be back.
Brett, what's up.

07:07.192 --> 07:09.022
- Gabriel?
- Nice to see you.

07:09.102 --> 07:10.878
Paul Orniaz.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.714
Paul's been helping out
since you were rotated home.

07:13.794 --> 07:16.618
- Okay.
- He has a particular focus.

07:16.698 --> 07:18.786
- Which is?
- You.

07:18.866 --> 07:22.681
- Okay, we ready?
- Let's do it.

07:25.574 --> 07:28.787
Let's go, we have a three-hour
ride ahead of us.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.119
I've read every one of your tech briefs 10
times, but I've never seen a Temple in action.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.862
<i>They really are giant lie detectors.</i>

07:47.942 --> 07:51.959
Calling a Temple a lie detector is like
calling the space shuttle a Cessna, kid.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.790
- We built the first in Taloqan.
- Afghanistan.

07:54.870 --> 07:57.549
- Now there's 12 around the world.
- <i>Thirteen.</i>

07:57.629 --> 08:00.269
- <i>Beijing went online two weeks ago.</i>
- Really?

08:00.349 --> 08:03.111
I just can't believe there's
one here on American soil.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.015
Bad guys don't just work overseas.

08:06.455 --> 08:09.880
You can beat a polygraph
by sticking a tack in your shoe...

08:09.960 --> 08:13.985
...and enhanced interrogations
take too long. Suspects lie.

08:14.065 --> 08:17.077
- Computers don't.
- Watch and learn.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.481
- All I need is the account number.
- If I knew it, you would have it.

08:38.946 --> 08:42.365
He's lying. He's visualizing
a series of numbers.

08:42.445 --> 08:45.487
It starts with three, seven...

08:45.567 --> 08:47.991
...nine, four.

08:48.071 --> 08:51.983
So there's nothing you can tell me
about account number 3794?

08:56.781 --> 08:59.076
So when is the attack going down?

08:59.518 --> 09:02.876
Monday, Wednesday, or Friday? Tuesday?

09:03.356 --> 09:05.277
Thursday?

09:05.357 --> 09:07.180
Come on, talk.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.315
- Talk.
- Saturday.

09:09.395 --> 09:12.005
- Saturday.
- <i>Saturday.</i>

09:13.233 --> 09:16.490
<i>Thursday? Thursday?</i>

09:16.570 --> 09:19.542
It's Thursday. Every time you say
Thursday, his readings spike.

09:19.622 --> 09:20.835
<i>Thursday?</i>

09:23.763 --> 09:27.503
Temples expose patterns
that we can only theorize about.

09:27.583 --> 09:31.626
I mean, they're unavailable
to the naked eye... until now.

10:01.590 --> 10:04.079
Tyler, Saeed, how we looking?

10:04.459 --> 10:06.268
Free and easy.

10:07.663 --> 10:09.544
Not a creature stirring.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.846
All clear.

10:24.484 --> 10:26.590
Genius, you made it look just like a prison.

10:26.670 --> 10:29.665
- It is a prison.
- Sorry?

10:29.745 --> 10:33.384
Ran out of funding right after it was
finished. It's perfect for our needs.

10:33.464 --> 10:36.169
The Temple in Vienna is inside
an abandoned opera house.

10:36.249 --> 10:38.386
We've had one cruising
the Mediterranean for three years.

10:38.466 --> 10:41.688
See, Temples are systems.
They can be applied anywhere.

10:41.768 --> 10:43.326
Hey.

10:43.606 --> 10:46.424
- Good to see you, Gabe.
- Welcome back, Gabe.

10:46.506 --> 10:48.764
- <i>You're up, Gabe.</i>
- All right.

10:49.244 --> 10:51.857
That's strange, the cameras are offline.

10:57.522 --> 10:59.932
All right, it should be synced.

11:00.711 --> 11:04.015
Gabriel Arkona, director
of science and technology...

11:04.095 --> 11:05.892
...72 Byron Hastings.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.383
Keep your eyes open.

11:51.316 --> 11:54.797
- Okay, let's suit up.
- Let's do it.

12:08.577 --> 12:11.265
Left flank, right flank, on deck.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.808
Thomas!

12:30.888 --> 12:33.153
Say "on deck," Thomas.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.775
Alex, Rainier, Tilson, do you copy?

13:08.773 --> 13:10.681
Clear it!

13:11.341 --> 13:12.918
Clear.

13:16.548 --> 13:18.126
Clear.

13:42.587 --> 13:44.302
<i>Access denied.</i>

13:44.382 --> 13:46.867
No, I'm not getting access.
We gotta get to command and control.

13:47.217 --> 13:50.093
- Let's move it.
- <i>Temple power inaccessible.</i>

13:51.023 --> 13:55.084
- This place is a ghost town.
- We find our team and get out.

13:57.564 --> 13:59.075
Go!

14:02.453 --> 14:03.962
Paul...

14:05.040 --> 14:07.929
- ...did you train with that gun?
- Of course.

14:08.009 --> 14:10.487
Well, it works better with the safety off.

14:15.684 --> 14:16.827
Go.

14:24.561 --> 14:26.484
Strange, they wouldn't
just abandon this place.

14:26.564 --> 14:29.375
It wasn't abandoned. They have to be here.

15:43.419 --> 15:44.929
Go.

15:51.295 --> 15:54.306
Tyler, Saeed, hold this section.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.567
Where is everybody?

16:29.073 --> 16:32.551
Okay. What's going on? What's going on?

16:59.269 --> 17:01.431
Okay, we're functional, but this...

17:01.511 --> 17:04.465
- ...this is strange.
- What?

17:04.546 --> 17:08.291
The power is below ten percent.
The Temple's running on fumes right now.

17:09.786 --> 17:13.939
It's dead. Don't waste your time.
Signal's jammed in here.

17:14.459 --> 17:17.349
- Have any idea what drained it?
- I don't know.

17:17.430 --> 17:21.320
- How do you not know?
- <i>Backup generator engaged.</i>

17:21.401 --> 17:23.756
Got the emergency lights on.
That's all I can do from here.

17:23.836 --> 17:26.726
Okay, we do it by foot, two by two.

17:26.806 --> 17:29.463
Paul, you stay here.
Gabe, you stay here, too.

17:29.543 --> 17:33.224
No, sir, I need to get utility
and figure out this power situation.

17:35.140 --> 17:39.028
Cap, I didn't come here
to sit on the sidelines.

17:39.755 --> 17:41.298
Okay.

17:43.793 --> 17:45.671
Stay here.

17:53.403 --> 17:56.327
- Take it slow.
- You ever gonna stop being my TO?

17:56.407 --> 17:58.451
Never if you're lucky.

18:03.689 --> 18:05.259
Clear.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.535
Clear.

19:46.403 --> 19:49.880
- Find something?
- I'm not sure.

20:09.230 --> 20:10.807
Clear.

20:27.283 --> 20:28.469
Shit!

20:29.519 --> 20:31.094
What?

20:31.187 --> 20:32.739
Alex.

20:35.893 --> 20:38.766
I found Alex. He's dead.

20:40.682 --> 20:44.571
Copy. Keep searching. Move out.

21:46.575 --> 21:48.152
Clear.

21:52.031 --> 21:53.574
Clear.

21:59.525 --> 22:01.102
Clear.

23:05.299 --> 23:07.310
<i>Access denied.</i>

23:08.570 --> 23:10.596
<i>Access denied.</i>

23:11.773 --> 23:14.218
<i>Temple tower inaccessible.</i>

23:34.533 --> 23:36.044
Guys?

23:36.737 --> 23:38.280
Hello?

23:50.519 --> 23:52.395
Come on.

24:19.652 --> 24:21.519
They got O'Neill.

24:21.599 --> 24:23.432
<i>She's gone.</i>

25:29.734 --> 25:31.311
Shit.

25:35.407 --> 25:36.564
What?

25:38.548 --> 25:40.633
Found Thomas.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.523
He's gone.

26:19.292 --> 26:22.261
- What do I tell Shelly?
- Or Anne.

26:22.341 --> 26:25.587
- Or O'Neill's husband.
- Lawrence.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.944
Last deep sea-run,
Alex told me he was getting engaged.

26:29.938 --> 26:31.948
Asked me to be his best man.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.291
What the hell's going on here, Chief?

26:36.711 --> 26:38.522
What's that?

26:39.380 --> 26:40.537
- Shit!
- Let's go.

26:40.617 --> 26:43.813
<i>Temple lockdown commencing in ten...</i>

26:45.452 --> 26:48.734
- <i>...four...
</i>- Paul, it's locking down!

26:50.181 --> 26:51.490
<i>...three...</i>

26:52.996 --> 26:55.232
- Gabe!
- It won't let me reset.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.622
Come on, hold it!

26:57.702 --> 27:00.091
- Gabe, talk to me.
- I'm trying to override it.

27:00.171 --> 27:02.397
- It won't let me reset!
- <i>Temple locked down.</i>

27:02.477 --> 27:05.755
The interior systems are active,
but all external protocols are offline.

27:05.835 --> 27:08.489
- What?
- In English, please!

27:08.884 --> 27:10.693
We're trapped.

27:27.637 --> 27:30.628
Gabriel and Paul,
meet me back at command control.

27:30.708 --> 27:32.918
The rest of you, keep searching.

28:15.526 --> 28:19.518
- Figured out what dropped the power?
- Not what but when.

28:19.598 --> 28:22.123
Last night, a huge surge in the system.

28:25.087 --> 28:28.445
- What's that?
- Sensory deprivation.

28:28.525 --> 28:31.265
We use it to subdue subjects
and reduce mental defenses...

28:31.345 --> 28:34.355
...but records say that one's
been auto for months.

28:41.290 --> 28:43.300
Did you check the tank?

28:45.495 --> 28:47.885
Up. Oh, my God!

28:48.165 --> 28:51.836
- Get your hands up!
- Hands up! Easy.

28:51.916 --> 28:54.726
We got a bogey. A team, B team.

28:55.206 --> 28:57.334
- What are you doing here?
- Get the fuck out!

28:57.414 --> 28:59.967
Get out. Hands up.

29:00.887 --> 29:02.568
- Riley.
- Easy!

29:02.648 --> 29:03.683
- Riley!
- Weapons down.

29:03.763 --> 29:05.605
- Hands up!
- Riley, what the hell you doing?

29:05.685 --> 29:08.007
- You don't know who this is?
- Stand down.

29:08.087 --> 29:10.544
Everyone, stand down, stand down.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.669
All of you.

29:16.164 --> 29:19.922
Feruz Ahmadi, number three
on the FBI's most wanted list.

29:20.002 --> 29:23.604
- Number one in Afghanistan.
- He was ally during Enduring Freedom...

29:23.684 --> 29:26.313
...but his methods were unacceptable.

29:26.463 --> 29:30.868
He used the war to eliminate
his rivals and solidify his power.

29:30.948 --> 29:36.040
Five years ago, he went on the run
and has been a ghost ever since.

29:36.120 --> 29:40.045
So how does one of the world's most
wanted war criminals end up on our shores?

29:40.125 --> 29:43.115
He flew. Found it in the evidence.

29:43.195 --> 29:46.088
- Prague to Heathrow to MSY.
- That's impossible.

29:46.168 --> 29:48.788
- You check the wire yesterday?
- On my day off?

29:48.868 --> 29:52.551
TSA issued a memo. Facial recall
went offline three different times.

29:52.631 --> 29:55.096
- Where?
- MSY, Heathrow, Prague.

29:55.176 --> 29:59.457
All of Ahmadi's connections at the exact
same moment he was passing through.

30:06.524 --> 30:09.377
All right, we're ready. We don't have
a lot of power, so let's make this quick.

30:09.457 --> 30:11.470
Riley, you're up.

30:16.334 --> 30:19.671
All right, we should have just
enough power to break him down.

30:21.872 --> 30:24.764
- He's got an itch.
- What? Where?

30:24.844 --> 30:28.434
Right there. Otherwise right now, he's flat.

30:28.814 --> 30:32.806
- At least we know who's responsible.
- Do we?

30:32.886 --> 30:37.570
What, he kills everybody and then locks
himself in the tank? Makes no sense.

30:51.774 --> 30:54.664
I should warn you, everything
you say, do, think or feel...

30:54.744 --> 30:57.243
...can and will be used against you.

30:58.883 --> 31:03.076
Pretty impressive, taking out
a place like this on our own turf.

31:03.156 --> 31:07.567
It's a tad more difficult
than gunning down unarmed citizens.

31:09.088 --> 31:11.450
<i>Watch your tone.</i>

31:11.530 --> 31:13.741
English, pig Latin...

31:15.270 --> 31:17.273
You can't hide in here.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.451
The fuck was that?

31:23.680 --> 31:25.547
What was that?

31:26.315 --> 31:28.720
I don't know, some kind of electrical surge.

31:40.431 --> 31:42.553
Now you torture me?

31:43.203 --> 31:46.246
How did you find this place?

31:46.605 --> 31:48.160
Simple.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.431
I followed your instructions.

31:50.511 --> 31:54.090
What the hell does that mean?
All readings indicate he's telling the truth.

31:55.749 --> 31:59.513
- Is there something I should know, Isaac?
- Only what's in this asshole's head.

31:59.593 --> 32:02.241
- <i>Bullshit!</i>
- I was sent coordinates.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.663
I followed them to here.

32:04.743 --> 32:07.170
Don't play games with me.

32:08.264 --> 32:10.521
I'm not the one playing games.

32:10.601 --> 32:13.262
And I tire of your...

32:15.338 --> 32:17.625
Go, go, go.

32:23.415 --> 32:27.904
- <i>Release me now or she dies.</i>
- Let her go right now! Right now!

32:29.489 --> 32:34.415
- You've got three fucking seconds!
- Release me now or she dies.

32:34.495 --> 32:37.419
Release me now or I will kill her!

32:37.499 --> 32:40.156
- Can't do that. Can't do that.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

32:40.236 --> 32:42.322
- Stop, stop, put them down!
- Who are you?

32:42.402 --> 32:46.994
I'm the guy who built this place.
And I know that you're telling the truth.

32:47.074 --> 32:50.680
You didn't choose to come here,
did you, General? You were delivered.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.604
And you want to know by who
just as badly as I do...

32:53.684 --> 32:55.839
...and because they found you once,
they're gonna find you again...

32:55.919 --> 32:58.142
...which means there's nowhere to run.

32:58.222 --> 33:02.627
I need you. I need you to help me
figure out what has happened here.

33:02.707 --> 33:06.191
So put it down. Put it down.

33:16.241 --> 33:18.054
Fucking mutt.

33:40.738 --> 33:41.830
Now what?

33:41.910 --> 33:43.995
Now we see what the hell
happened here last night.

33:44.075 --> 33:46.051
<i>Temple playback, begin.</i>

33:51.119 --> 33:53.174
How does it know when to cut?

33:53.254 --> 33:57.065
It's editing logic based
on activity and biometrics.

34:02.564 --> 34:05.768
<i>I know what you're thinking, okay?
Just drop it.</i>

34:05.848 --> 34:07.720
<i>All right, all right.</i>

34:07.800 --> 34:09.846
<i>Don't say anything.</i>

34:13.677 --> 34:16.266
- So, how was last night?
- Yeah, good times.

34:16.346 --> 34:20.338
- You doing okay today, buddy?
- I'm all right. Gotta keep the peepers open.

34:20.418 --> 34:22.438
You know... wild man.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.659
You know what? I'm just glad
to be back on friendly shores.

34:24.739 --> 34:27.992
- Preach.
- Nothing like winters in the Hindu Kush.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.483
Man, that was...

34:31.263 --> 34:33.139
Proximity alert.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.795
No fucking way.

34:41.876 --> 34:44.748
Ahmadi? What the fuck is he doing here?

34:44.829 --> 34:47.478
All right, people. We're on the clock.
Stack up and move out.

34:47.558 --> 34:49.371
Double-time. Let's go.

34:50.552 --> 34:54.177
- You said there were no alerts.
- Yeah, there were none whatsoever.

34:54.257 --> 34:57.679
- What was transmitted to Langley?
- I'm pulling it up now.

34:57.759 --> 35:02.120
- <i>Langley feed playback, begin.</i>
- <i>I'm just glad to be back on friendly shores.</i>

35:02.200 --> 35:05.801
- <i>Preach.</i>
- Here comes the alarm.

35:08.724 --> 35:10.534
<i>Proximity alert.</i>

35:17.517 --> 35:19.384
You sure you got the right night?

35:20.054 --> 35:22.310
Yeah, check the time stamps.

35:23.090 --> 35:25.779
The time stamps are exactly the same.

35:25.859 --> 35:28.950
This is direct from the servers
here in the Temple.

35:29.530 --> 35:32.221
That was broadcast to Langley...

35:32.301 --> 35:34.894
...and this is what actually happened.

35:34.974 --> 35:38.238
Anyone care to explain how the same
camera recorded different events...

35:38.318 --> 35:40.327
...at the same goddamn time?

35:45.383 --> 35:46.637
- <i>Who's with you?</i>
- <i>No one.</i>

35:46.717 --> 35:48.732
- How many, goddamn it?
- I am alone.

35:48.812 --> 35:50.696
Talk, fucker!

35:53.526 --> 35:56.248
You sent a passport and ticket to my account.

35:56.328 --> 35:59.750
You said the path was clear and it was
imperative that we meet at once.

35:59.830 --> 36:01.870
Nobody sent you shit.

36:05.806 --> 36:08.864
- Let's put his ass in the chair.
- Negative.

36:09.544 --> 36:11.434
Put him in the tank.

36:11.914 --> 36:14.035
- <i>How many, goddamn it?</i>
- <i>I am alone.</i>

36:14.115 --> 36:16.192
<i>Talk, fucker!</i>

36:18.888 --> 36:22.244
<i>You sent a passport and ticket
to my account. You said the...</i>

36:22.324 --> 36:25.130
- Looks like he's telling the truth.
- <i>...imperative that we meet at once.</i>

36:25.210 --> 36:27.104
<i>Nobody sent you...</i>

36:35.545 --> 36:37.188
- <i>Negative.</i>
- <i>I don't know why he's here.</i>

36:37.268 --> 36:39.102
They're just as confused as we are.

36:39.182 --> 36:41.756
Happens when a monster pops up on your radar.

36:50.824 --> 36:52.022
<i>Help me.</i>

37:02.038 --> 37:05.229
- Something's got them spooked.
- We don't get spooked.

37:05.509 --> 37:08.098
Maybe the system was hacked
to change the footage.

37:08.178 --> 37:10.455
Temples don't get hacked.

37:19.626 --> 37:21.436
What the fuck?

37:30.441 --> 37:32.108
Back... back up.

37:35.844 --> 37:38.055
<i>Resume playback.</i>

37:39.582 --> 37:41.426
What's he firing at?

37:42.569 --> 37:44.012
<i>Come on.</i>

37:45.893 --> 37:48.914
Although I walk through the valley
of death, I shall fear no evil.

37:48.994 --> 37:51.916
Yeah. Although I walk through the valley
of death, I shall fear no evil...

37:51.996 --> 37:55.041
...'cause I'm the baddest
motherfucker in the valley!

37:57.803 --> 38:00.014
Who's got the goddamn knife?

38:09.683 --> 38:12.223
I mean, this is impossible. It's like...

38:12.653 --> 38:14.197
What?

38:16.424 --> 38:18.928
It's like we're only seeing
what it wants us to see.

38:19.008 --> 38:20.514
"It"?

38:23.800 --> 38:26.779
- The Temple.
- <i>Resume playback.</i>

39:29.176 --> 39:31.025
<i>Help me.</i>

39:36.317 --> 39:37.813
<i>Help me.</i>

39:43.492 --> 39:47.701
<i>Somebody help me. Somebody help me.</i>

39:53.638 --> 39:55.494
Who's there?

39:56.624 --> 39:58.502
Who's there?

40:08.957 --> 40:10.466
No.

40:25.942 --> 40:27.832
Who's there?

40:29.012 --> 40:31.890
- Who's there?
- Help me.

40:34.352 --> 40:35.547
Hello?

40:42.861 --> 40:44.750
He killed her.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.989
<i>Warning, warning.
Temple power system failure.</i>

40:49.069 --> 40:51.820
- Power dropped off a cliff.
- But what drained it?

40:51.900 --> 40:53.615
It's the Temple.

40:53.695 --> 40:57.216
For some reason, it started running
a thousand diagnostics at the same time.

40:57.296 --> 41:00.536
Every command by authorized
personnel is logged...

41:01.216 --> 41:04.404
...except the logs
during the attack are empty.

41:05.454 --> 41:07.679
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

41:08.741 --> 41:11.331
The Temple was issuing its own commands.

41:13.602 --> 41:15.425
What is she seeing?

41:24.776 --> 41:27.821
Oh, my God, please, please help.

42:10.162 --> 42:11.972
What do you want?

42:13.721 --> 42:15.750
What do you want from me?

42:27.015 --> 42:29.026
Oh, God.

42:29.687 --> 42:31.262
Shit.

42:42.099 --> 42:44.390
Supposed to be a cush post...

42:45.060 --> 42:47.684
...a reward for 13 years in hell.

42:48.189 --> 42:51.731
Well, hell will find you anywhere.

42:51.811 --> 42:54.139
I'm sorry I dragged you into this...

42:54.219 --> 42:56.288
...subjected you to this.

42:57.118 --> 43:00.742
I want to find out what happened to our
people just as badly as you do, Isaac.

43:00.822 --> 43:02.644
How do we do that?

43:02.724 --> 43:05.382
Well, Temples were built to expose the truth.

43:05.862 --> 43:08.737
We just have to figure out
how to get her back to full power.

43:11.701 --> 43:15.027
- Find the glitch?
- Not sure there is a glitch.

43:15.107 --> 43:18.991
We know how protective you are of your baby,
Gabe, but I think it's pretty clear here...

43:19.071 --> 43:21.159
- ...Hal's blown a spark plug.
- Look, Brett...

43:21.239 --> 43:25.087
...Temples are designed to reveal
activity at a quantum state.

43:25.167 --> 43:28.423
At those levels, fakery is simply impossible.

43:28.603 --> 43:30.617
Maybe it's time to consider the impossible.

43:30.697 --> 43:33.766
Saeed, the last thing we need right now
is any of your voodoo bullshit.

43:33.846 --> 43:36.180
Listen, just because you possess
a narrow worldview...

43:36.260 --> 43:38.453
...doesn't mean
that the rest of us must abide.

43:38.533 --> 43:40.588
No, you're right.

43:40.668 --> 43:43.693
- Somebody see if we got a Ouija board.
- Shut up, Brett.

43:43.773 --> 43:45.783
So you believe him?

43:48.145 --> 43:49.988
What about you, Tyler?

43:51.364 --> 43:53.809
Isaac? Anybody?

43:55.091 --> 43:58.130
Exactly. Shit.

43:58.455 --> 44:03.128
Gabe, you invented the thing. You know
more about its capabilities than any of us.

44:04.563 --> 44:07.007
Has anything like this ever happened before?

44:09.269 --> 44:11.112
- No.
- No, 'cause it's a hack...

44:11.192 --> 44:15.395
...plain and simple. The bastards are probably
watching us now laughing their asses off.

44:15.475 --> 44:17.299
- We're cut off.
- As far as he knows.

44:17.379 --> 44:20.093
- He knows more than anyone.
- He doesn't know shit!

44:20.173 --> 44:21.674
Enough.

44:24.020 --> 44:26.810
Look, no offense and he's
your friend at all, Chief...

44:26.890 --> 44:29.969
...but he can't even keep his own
family alive. What good is he to us?

44:30.049 --> 44:32.203
- Brett.
- What the fuck did you say?

44:32.429 --> 44:35.339
- You heard what I said.
- What the fuck did you say?

44:35.419 --> 44:36.988
Guys!

44:38.068 --> 44:41.291
Don't put your hands on me.
Don't put your hands on me.

44:44.121 --> 44:46.664
Okay, big boy, come on.

44:46.944 --> 44:48.478
Hey.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.561
You're not used to being
in the dark. I get it.

44:55.641 --> 44:58.279
But whoever's doing this isn't finished yet.

44:59.259 --> 45:01.303
We still have a job to do.

45:03.665 --> 45:06.120
We do it as a team. You got that?

45:06.200 --> 45:08.878
- Yes, sir.
- As a team.

45:12.942 --> 45:14.571
We need him.

45:15.762 --> 45:18.035
I want the air, water, everything checked.

45:18.115 --> 45:20.776
Let's figure out what happened
here last night. Move out.

46:01.132 --> 46:03.376
Air's clear in corridor C.

46:44.281 --> 46:47.740
All right, 655-876-5871 disabled.

46:47.820 --> 46:50.508
Have you tried logging in
with a different interface?

46:50.588 --> 46:52.547
- <i>Gabriel.</i>
- Yeah, go, Saeed.

46:52.627 --> 46:55.016
Come see me at the loading bay. Now.

46:56.096 --> 46:58.172
Yeah, sure, be right there.

48:57.938 --> 48:59.491
Saeed?

48:59.871 --> 49:02.250
Loading bay! Loading bay!

49:02.777 --> 49:05.461
Saeed? Saeed?

49:13.171 --> 49:14.747
Saeed!

49:24.034 --> 49:26.545
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

49:30.075 --> 49:31.585
Sy!

49:33.079 --> 49:34.616
Sy!

49:36.014 --> 49:37.558
Sy.

49:39.419 --> 49:40.696
Goddamn it.

49:44.558 --> 49:46.813
Where you at, bastards? Where you at?

49:46.893 --> 49:49.307
What the fuck is going on?

49:51.916 --> 49:53.725
Where you at?

49:54.070 --> 49:56.146
Who the fuck did this?

50:01.611 --> 50:04.619
- What the hell is that?
- What are you talking about?

50:14.692 --> 50:18.518
- Whoever did this is still inside.
- I say we start blasting our way out of here.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.553
- Agreed.
- It's not a democracy.

50:20.633 --> 50:22.556
I'm not leaving until
we figure out who did this.

50:22.636 --> 50:25.126
Yeah, even if you end up right
next to everyone in the cooler?

50:25.206 --> 50:28.529
Alex, Rainier, Tilson,
Thomas, Saeed, O'Neill...

50:28.609 --> 50:32.298
- ...none of those lives mean anything to you?
- Not as much as saving my own ass.

50:32.378 --> 50:35.755
- Fucking asshole.
- You think I give a shit what you think?

50:36.785 --> 50:40.655
What are you gonna do? What are you
gonna do? What are you gonna do?

50:40.735 --> 50:44.013
- Easy!
- Save it. Save it for the enemy.

50:44.093 --> 50:47.302
- If only we knew who that was, Chief.
- Maybe the better question is why.

50:47.382 --> 50:49.854
The fuck does that mean?

50:49.934 --> 50:53.759
Temples are hooked into the most secure
intelligence systems on the planet...

50:53.839 --> 50:56.273
...including facial recog at airports.

50:57.108 --> 51:00.106
You compromise a Temple,
you can travel anywhere you want.

51:00.186 --> 51:03.517
- It's just like I said.
- No, no, it's not a hack.

51:03.597 --> 51:07.140
And since we're stuck on means
and opportunity, let's consider motive.

51:07.220 --> 51:09.539
Who'd wanna kill a couple CIA spooks, right?

51:09.619 --> 51:11.909
Can only think of a few million suspects.

51:11.989 --> 51:15.583
Yeah, but how many are gonna go through
the trouble of something like this?

51:15.663 --> 51:19.843
- They're sending us a message.
- Well, message received. Everybody's dead.

51:22.571 --> 51:24.315
Not everyone.

51:31.015 --> 51:32.930
You again.

51:33.010 --> 51:36.419
The builder of Temples.
The architect of truth.

51:38.057 --> 51:41.802
Five minutes, no more.
We're on borrowed time.

51:45.800 --> 51:49.490
- There's no way out, Ahmadi.
- What the hell's he doing?

51:50.170 --> 51:53.448
You have all those itchy trigger fingers
out there waiting for you.

51:56.744 --> 51:58.800
Tell me what happened.

51:59.400 --> 52:01.710
I was in your fucking tank.

52:01.790 --> 52:05.383
I know. I heard you scream.

52:08.151 --> 52:12.003
- Power's dropping faster than planned.
- Gabriel knows what he's doing.

52:14.299 --> 52:17.122
It is a devil's house you've built.

52:17.502 --> 52:19.379
You would know.

52:20.123 --> 52:23.179
Today's ally is tomorrow's enemy.

52:23.559 --> 52:26.188
Perhaps your past is catching up to you.

52:28.132 --> 52:29.975
What'd you see in there?

52:31.585 --> 52:34.255
Why don't you ask your mechanical god?

52:37.759 --> 52:39.636
Very well.

52:53.578 --> 52:56.188
This is what the Temple saw in your head.

53:10.630 --> 53:13.164
- Isaac?
- Let's give him time.

53:13.244 --> 53:15.177
He's going deep.

53:28.752 --> 53:32.264
No! Tell me what happened!
Tell me what happened, Ahmadi!

53:32.344 --> 53:35.482
Why would the Temple deliver you
right into the lion's den?

53:43.969 --> 53:46.446
<i>Temple power system failure.</i>

53:50.309 --> 53:53.134
<i>Temple interrogation analysis complete.</i>

53:53.214 --> 53:54.931
Who is that?

54:05.627 --> 54:08.418
Should put a bullet
in this asshole right now.

54:08.498 --> 54:11.722
Pretty clear Ahmadi's
got nothing to do with this.

54:11.802 --> 54:13.824
Somebody's messing with us.

54:14.404 --> 54:16.461
Means we missed something.

54:17.041 --> 54:18.851
Let's find it.

54:32.809 --> 54:35.445
Still no luck on what this drawing is.

54:36.313 --> 54:39.752
Langley's code base
would make this a hell of a lot faster.

54:39.832 --> 54:42.224
We keep backups in the server room.

54:42.304 --> 54:44.692
- C corridor, room 36.
- Seriously?

54:44.772 --> 54:47.130
Yeah, Temples copy down all DBs every hour.

54:47.210 --> 54:50.499
They'll be as recent as last night.
You're going to need a remote unit.

54:50.579 --> 54:54.394
- That wasn't in your schematics report.
- An incomplete CIA report?

54:54.474 --> 54:56.328
There's a shocker.

55:03.512 --> 55:06.039
Let's see what's hiding in your head, Ahmadi.

55:12.940 --> 55:15.535
<i>Facial recognition initiated.</i>

55:15.615 --> 55:17.486
Need more power.

55:39.505 --> 55:41.462
Stay back!

56:17.882 --> 56:19.733
What are you trying to show me?

56:33.332 --> 56:35.394
There's one second missing.

56:44.979 --> 56:46.523
What...

57:06.637 --> 57:08.214
Hello?

57:10.677 --> 57:12.220
Hello?

57:19.854 --> 57:21.697
Who's up there?

57:23.591 --> 57:24.982
Hello?

57:36.908 --> 57:38.418
Hello?

58:15.151 --> 58:17.996
- Hey.
- Jesus!

58:19.088 --> 58:22.502
- What is it?
- Nothing, I thought...

58:22.959 --> 58:26.117
- ...nothing.
- You all right?

58:26.197 --> 58:29.453
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

58:29.533 --> 58:31.601
I got to get back to work.

58:40.447 --> 58:41.969
<i>Isaac.</i>

58:42.349 --> 58:46.024
- Go for Isaac.
- <i>Come meet me in the generator room.</i>

58:46.904 --> 58:48.715
Copy that.

58:49.590 --> 58:50.746
Tell me what you see.

58:50.826 --> 58:54.517
I see a woman I recruited from INSCOM
ten years ago being murdered.

58:54.597 --> 58:56.475
But by what?

58:57.635 --> 59:01.291
If I measure the wavelengths
in the room, there's a range of colors.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.547
And the only source
of pure blackness is right there.

59:03.627 --> 59:06.496
Now black is an absence of color.

59:06.576 --> 59:11.115
It's an absorber of light. It's a void.
And if I isolate that patch of black...

59:14.987 --> 59:16.797
What the...

59:18.492 --> 59:22.116
Our enemy is not just inside
these walls. It's in the code.

59:22.196 --> 59:24.439
O'Neill was screaming
not just for her life...

59:24.519 --> 59:27.194
...but at the sight of whatever
was holding her under.

59:28.304 --> 59:30.727
Maybe you should head back to
command until we sort this all out.

59:30.807 --> 59:35.045
I'm no safer there then I am here.
Don't you understand what's doing this?

59:36.613 --> 59:38.010
It's the Temple.

59:39.383 --> 59:42.966
- The Temple is a system, Gabriel.
- Not anymore.

59:43.046 --> 59:45.977
And it's judged us deserving of punishment.

59:46.057 --> 59:48.334
The question is why.

59:50.529 --> 59:52.652
- Just tell me you haven't felt it.
- Felt what?

59:52.732 --> 59:56.823
The presence all around us.
The Temple has reached a tipping point.

59:57.153 --> 59:59.209
So you're suggesting
that it's thinking for itself?

59:59.289 --> 01:00:02.962
I'm not suggesting it. I'm stating it.
There's no more barriers.

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:06.521
There's no dimensions that it won't expose.

01:00:07.883 --> 01:00:09.740
<i>Hey, Gabriel?</i>

01:00:10.717 --> 01:00:12.208
Go for Gabe.

01:00:12.288 --> 01:00:15.366
Can you come see me?
I think I figured something out.

01:00:19.095 --> 01:00:23.753
The cuneiform is an ancient language,
but it's not a word, it's a symbol.

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:27.188
Noshaq Mountain in the Takhar province.

01:00:27.268 --> 01:00:29.923
It's the second-highest peak
in the Hindu Kush.

01:00:30.003 --> 01:00:32.881
Like Ahmadi, that's another link
back to Afghanistan.

01:00:33.411 --> 01:00:35.081
Why?

01:00:42.087 --> 01:00:43.597
Riley?

01:00:47.929 --> 01:00:50.653
- <i>Temple power system failure.</i>
- I have to get back to the generator room.

01:00:50.733 --> 01:00:53.870
Listen, keep digging, find out what's
so important about that location.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.513
Okay.

01:01:47.231 --> 01:01:48.428
Hey!

01:01:51.736 --> 01:01:53.504
Tyler!

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:54.685
Hello?

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.870
Tyler!

01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:04.494
Hey!

01:02:05.719 --> 01:02:07.296
Tyler!

01:02:07.856 --> 01:02:09.399
Tyler!

01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:22.295
Tyler! Tyler!

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:25.794
Riley! Hey. What happened?

01:02:26.674 --> 01:02:28.376
I thought I saw something.

01:02:29.981 --> 01:02:32.512
- Hey!
- Yeah.

01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:37.341
- Talk to me.
- No, I'm good.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.311
Just got locked in.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.469
- I'm good.
- You sure?

01:03:31.852 --> 01:03:33.662
Keep it together.

01:03:37.592 --> 01:03:40.035
Stop! Come back!

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:44.307
Don't shoot!

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:43.800
<i>Temple power restoration in progress.</i>

01:06:54.889 --> 01:06:56.164
Hello?

01:07:01.012 --> 01:07:03.534
<i>Facial recognition complete.</i>

01:07:12.508 --> 01:07:13.996
<i>Warning.</i>

01:07:14.076 --> 01:07:17.088
<i>Sensory deprivation system breach.</i>

01:07:50.752 --> 01:07:52.564
What the...

01:08:23.457 --> 01:08:25.452
What the fuck's going on?

01:09:17.871 --> 01:09:21.312
I want to believe you, Acum. I really do.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.548
You know, these guys, you know...

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:29.032
...they're going to need more verification
to know that we're on the same page.

01:09:31.136 --> 01:09:33.224
What does that mean?

01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:36.261
It means we need to make sure
you're not full of shit...

01:09:36.341 --> 01:09:38.831
...and you're not working against us.

01:09:38.911 --> 01:09:40.961
We want to be friends, Acum. We really do.

01:09:41.041 --> 01:09:44.435
But there's a long history of good
friends becoming bitter enemies.

01:09:44.515 --> 01:09:46.644
An even longer one...

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:49.751
...of good people being abandoned by...

01:09:53.763 --> 01:09:57.623
I found this in his dwelling!
American issue. An alliance phone.

01:09:57.703 --> 01:10:00.709
- He's been listening to our every word.
- No.

01:10:02.539 --> 01:10:05.217
Help! Help!

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.503
They've been following us, our every move.

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:15.863
I listen to everyone's move to lead
my people away from the battlefields.

01:10:15.943 --> 01:10:18.825
- Where'd you get it?
- Salvage on the M45.

01:10:18.905 --> 01:10:22.812
He's talking about the ambush at Drosch.
We lost ten good men out there, asshole.

01:10:22.892 --> 01:10:26.851
No, no, not by our hands.
We followed the smoke after it was done.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:29.842
We have lived in these hills for decades...

01:10:29.922 --> 01:10:32.244
...evading oppressor after oppressor.

01:10:32.324 --> 01:10:36.115
We are not your enemy.
Please, we are not your enemy.

01:10:36.195 --> 01:10:39.606
We want peace, believe me.
We are not your enemy.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:58.074
101st airborne is landing
in less than 48 hours...

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:01.979
...and I don't want them to drop into
an ambush like them boys in Drosch.

01:11:02.059 --> 01:11:05.270
- Copy that, Chief.
- Why are you following us?

01:11:24.284 --> 01:11:26.804
- Tilson? Tilson!
- Back up.

01:11:26.884 --> 01:11:29.460
- Back.
- O'Neill.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.334
Calm down! Back up.

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:35.105
- She's okay.
- She's okay.

01:11:40.369 --> 01:11:42.379
Control her side!

01:11:42.885 --> 01:11:44.734
Get them out of here!

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.581
- Chief...
- Get them out of here.

01:11:49.661 --> 01:11:51.901
- Control her!
- Move!

01:12:02.828 --> 01:12:05.553
They're calling for a service guard. Please!

01:12:05.633 --> 01:12:08.510
- Please, I can help you.
- Now he wants to help?

01:12:10.483 --> 01:12:13.627
Please, no one knows
these hills better than we do.

01:12:13.707 --> 01:12:16.230
I can track your enemies' movement.

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:19.956
I can give you intel.
Whatever you ask. Please.

01:12:23.352 --> 01:12:26.016
Just let my family go, please.

01:12:27.258 --> 01:12:29.411
- Stand down.
- Chief.

01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:31.320
Stand down!

01:12:37.499 --> 01:12:41.372
- Everything will be okay.
- You are weak! He lies!

01:12:41.452 --> 01:12:43.740
Please! Please!

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.723
No! No!

01:12:53.346 --> 01:12:55.397
Hands where I can see them!

01:12:59.445 --> 01:13:02.737
- No, no, no, no!
- Come back! Stop!

01:13:04.967 --> 01:13:07.573
Don't shoot! Don't!

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.932
Stay back! I said stay back! Stay back!

01:13:15.813 --> 01:13:18.796
Back up, all of you! Gun!

01:13:27.894 --> 01:13:29.971
Wait, who's he?

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:39.773
- You all right? Clear!
- Clear!

01:13:42.245 --> 01:13:44.088
Hold that side!

01:13:51.223 --> 01:13:54.301
- What the fuck, Chief?
- Clear!

01:13:57.232 --> 01:14:00.587
- Clear right.
- Clear left.

01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:02.476
All clear.

01:14:09.141 --> 01:14:11.753
No, Isaac! No!

01:15:00.936 --> 01:15:02.745
What's this?

01:15:06.176 --> 01:15:08.688
Gabriel told me to keep digging.

01:15:08.768 --> 01:15:11.435
- We've been duped, kid.
- I don't understand.

01:15:11.515 --> 01:15:16.373
I know he's your hero, but there's only
one person who could pull all this off...

01:15:16.453 --> 01:15:19.313
...who could turn
this insane asylum against us.

01:15:20.493 --> 01:15:23.771
- No.
- He's fucking with our minds.

01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:26.820
But why?

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:30.279
I think you know why.
I mean, after all, you're helping him.

01:15:32.439 --> 01:15:34.095
What?

01:15:34.825 --> 01:15:38.037
No, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

01:15:38.981 --> 01:15:40.858
I swear.

01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:51.600
Okay, kid. I don't need a Temple
to see that you're telling the truth.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.504
Thank you...

01:16:03.843 --> 01:16:05.488
Let's move.

01:16:11.184 --> 01:16:12.761
Gabriel.

01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:16.720
Shit.

01:16:18.426 --> 01:16:20.982
Go find Ahmadi and Brett.
I'll locate Gabriel.

01:16:21.062 --> 01:16:24.446
- Isaac...
- Now. Now!

01:16:24.526 --> 01:16:26.757
Go, go!

01:16:27.387 --> 01:16:29.444
Time to blast the fuck out of here.

01:16:29.974 --> 01:16:31.551
Shit.

01:17:13.224 --> 01:17:15.114
I found Gabriel.

01:17:17.446 --> 01:17:19.140
Goddamn it, Isaac.

01:17:21.265 --> 01:17:23.821
- Does he know anything?
- He doesn't know shit.

01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:25.705
The Temple showed me.

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:32.787
<i>It showed me what you did
to Acum and his people.</i>

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.537
It doesn't have to be this way, Isaac.

01:17:37.217 --> 01:17:40.295
- <i>Too late.</i>
- Yeah, it does.

01:17:43.557 --> 01:17:45.581
The Temple's evolved.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:49.890
It knows all of our secrets, Isaac.

01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:53.040
You did this, not the Temple.

01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:56.009
- You still don't believe?
- There's nothing to believe.

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:58.617
You're going to pay for what you did.

01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:01.242
All of you.

01:18:01.322 --> 01:18:04.631
Sorry, old friend. I don't think
it's gonna work out like that.

01:18:11.073 --> 01:18:13.141
<i>How's the exit strategy?</i>

01:18:16.663 --> 01:18:18.686
Almost ready, Chief.

01:18:18.766 --> 01:18:22.524
I knew when I saw Ahmadi that somebody
was gonna have to pay for this shit.

01:18:22.604 --> 01:18:24.179
Isaac.

01:18:25.206 --> 01:18:27.877
Just like last time. No witnesses.

01:18:27.957 --> 01:18:30.465
<i>Pull that trigger. Let's go home.</i>

01:18:30.545 --> 01:18:33.757
- You don't have to do this, Isaac.
- Yeah, I do.

01:18:36.119 --> 01:18:37.667
Sorry.

01:18:40.525 --> 01:18:42.401
Gabriel, run!

01:18:45.931 --> 01:18:48.608
Isaac. Chief?

01:18:51.033 --> 01:18:54.244
Come on, Gabe! Move it! Go, go, go!

01:19:26.445 --> 01:19:29.924
<i>Temple power restoration now available.</i>

01:19:33.585 --> 01:19:37.998
<i>Authentication key needed
for a full power restoration.</i>

01:20:16.436 --> 01:20:17.945
Hey!

01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:26.335
<i>Awaiting authentication key
for a full power restoration.</i>

01:20:26.415 --> 01:20:28.225
Let's finish this.

01:20:35.325 --> 01:20:38.773
- Don't get in my way, Brett.
- The issue isn't with you, Riley.

01:21:16.103 --> 01:21:17.680
Hush.

01:21:19.777 --> 01:21:21.732
Go to sleep now.

01:21:21.812 --> 01:21:23.822
