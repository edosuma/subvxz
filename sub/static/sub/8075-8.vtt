WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:06.840
[theme music]

00:06.874 --> 00:08.542
I'm sick of turkey
for Thanksgiving.

00:08.576 --> 00:09.543
Yeah.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.212
How come it always
has to be turkey?

00:11.245 --> 00:12.113
Yes.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.381
Where does that come from?

00:13.414 --> 00:15.216
You have to start
cooking it on Labor Day

00:15.249 --> 00:17.118
to get it ready
for Thanksgiving.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.352
Let's just get a hem.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.288
It comes already cooked.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.522
[baby crying]

00:21.555 --> 00:26.360
Oh, I don't think that
sits too well with the boys.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.695
How about a pot roast?

00:31.899 --> 00:34.435
Boring!

00:34.468 --> 00:35.436
All right.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.937
It's going to be turkey.

00:36.970 --> 00:41.008
[squeak]

00:41.041 --> 00:44.645
Jerry Garcia wants
turkey, don't you?

00:44.678 --> 00:47.215
Cause he knows
turkey's tradition,

00:47.248 --> 00:50.384
cause it costs like $0.05 a ton.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.086
Now, to recap the list.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.454
Oh, and what kind of
rolls do you want?

00:53.487 --> 00:55.055
Do you want the kind that
shrivel when they burn

00:55.089 --> 00:58.292
or the kind that
burst into flames?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.894
Well, flames are
more fun for the kids.

01:00.928 --> 01:04.098
And holidays are for children.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.065
All right, then.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.700
We have the flaming
rolls, check.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.236
Salad, check.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.670
Sodas, check.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.140
Hey, would you get
me some earplugs too?

01:12.173 --> 01:13.707
So I don't have to
listen to Darlene

01:13.741 --> 01:16.810
gripe about the slaughter
of innocent turkeys?

01:16.844 --> 01:18.412
Thanksgiving
gets on my nerves.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.747
Big time.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.415
It's like you finally get
your weight down to something

01:21.449 --> 01:22.983
comfortable, and boom.
It's Thanksgiving.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.752
Yeah.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.854
Family you can't stand
visits from out of town.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.489
You've got to pretend
you like them.

01:28.522 --> 01:33.394
Then, of course, mom starts
guzzling the chardonnay.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.595
Well, everybody
sits around seeing

01:34.628 --> 01:35.596
who can tell the biggest lie.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.665
And it starts with
Mom and the pies.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.833
And she says that
she bakes them,

01:39.867 --> 01:41.835
and everyone knows that
she buys them, because they

01:41.869 --> 01:44.838
don't even fit in the pan.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.608
I think Thanksgiving is
just a man's holiday anyhow.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.509
Wait.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.843
Wait, Roseanne.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.813
I want these guys to hear
that because maybe we

01:52.846 --> 01:55.849
can save them if we catch
them while they're young.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.286
Oh, you don't have anything
to worry about Jackie

01:58.319 --> 02:01.322
because they're going to be
side by side with their mommies

02:01.355 --> 02:03.724
in the kitchen helping
cook up a big, big feast.

02:03.757 --> 02:04.625
Amen.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.694
You tell it, sister.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.963
You know, men invented
football just so they could

02:09.997 --> 02:12.233
get out of doing the dishes.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.267
That's right.

02:13.301 --> 02:16.604
And they claim that
it's a tradition.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.738
Tradition all right.

02:17.771 --> 02:20.308
Us slaving over the hot
stove, serving the meal,

02:20.341 --> 02:23.043
and then cleaning up the sink
full of dirty dishes afterward.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.614
Yes.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.183
And then the men get to pass
out and eat all they want

02:29.217 --> 02:32.152
and collapse watching
the Dallas cheerleaders.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.387
OK.

02:33.421 --> 02:36.290
So to recap the holiday,
we've got Mom getting tipsy,

02:36.324 --> 02:37.825
lying about the pies--

02:37.858 --> 02:40.394
cheap yams that have to be
topped with marshmallows

02:40.428 --> 02:41.929
to move them at all--

02:41.962 --> 02:45.599
Darlene griping about
meat; and the men

02:45.633 --> 02:47.335
passing out in front of
the TV; everybody else

02:47.368 --> 02:49.036
getting in a huge fight.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.404
All in all, it's
not a bad holiday.

02:53.374 --> 02:57.211
[them music]

03:38.419 --> 03:41.755
[laughter]

03:44.825 --> 03:46.927
Well, Mister Turkey!

03:46.960 --> 03:49.963
Tomorrow's the big day!

03:49.997 --> 03:52.366
We'll roast you up,
set you on a platter,

03:52.400 --> 03:56.670
and then we'll be the ones
going gobble, gobble, gobble.

03:56.704 --> 04:00.040
[cackle] Get it?

04:00.073 --> 04:05.779
[laughter]

04:07.815 --> 04:11.319
Well, you had to cut off his
head, pluck him, and truss him,

04:11.352 --> 04:12.853
but you finally
found an audience.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.291
Hey, Chief.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.893
Have fun at your
Thanksgiving pageant.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.762
Yeah, break a leg.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.931
Oh, don't feel
bad you can't come.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.167
I mean, it's my fault. I really
should have told you sooner.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.769
That's OK.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.839
Uh, DJ, there's something
I have to tell you.

04:31.872 --> 04:32.840
What?

04:32.873 --> 04:33.741
We are coming!

04:33.774 --> 04:37.811
Get your coat, Dan!

04:37.845 --> 04:38.879
No way!

04:38.912 --> 04:40.681
I mean, you're just
gonna embarrass me!

04:40.714 --> 04:44.051
Like the time you drank that
kid's pop at the science fair.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.218
How was I supposed
to know he was

04:45.252 --> 04:49.122
dissolving coins at the bottom?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.090
What about the baby?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.091
Ha, ha.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.225
There's not a
babysitter dumb enough

04:52.259 --> 04:54.895
in town to come to this house.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.498
Luckily for you, your
dear sweet grandmother

04:57.531 --> 04:59.800
volunteered to babysit.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.535
I like my other
grandma better!

05:04.405 --> 05:08.909
Suck up all you want,
DJ, but we're still going.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.211
Come on.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.415
I mean, this is really
important to me.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.917
I've been rehearsing for months.

05:16.950 --> 05:20.454
I mean, it would mean so much
to me if you didn't come.

05:23.391 --> 05:26.627
Sorry, Deej, but
other kids have to deal

05:26.660 --> 05:28.462
with disappointments like this.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.631
It's about time you learned
that we won't be able to miss

05:30.664 --> 05:31.465
all your school events.

05:34.301 --> 05:37.371
But we will try our best
to skip your graduation.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.909
Come on, Deej.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.010
It could be worse.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.978
Someone you really
hate could be coming.

05:45.012 --> 05:45.879
Yeah.

05:45.913 --> 05:46.747
Someone like--

05:52.586 --> 05:54.154
Nice skirt, loser.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.123
Let's go.

05:56.156 --> 06:00.528
This day couldn't
get any worse!

06:00.561 --> 06:03.864
[music playing]

06:05.933 --> 06:09.236
[applause]

06:10.337 --> 06:14.107
Darlene, you
just missed my eye.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.075
Yeah, I know.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.344
I'm a little off today.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.113
This is the dullest
Thanksgiving program ever.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.250
We're definitely bring liquor
to the Christmas pageant.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.184
I'm late.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.318
What did I miss?

06:25.352 --> 06:29.923
The Knicks against the
Celtics and "NYPD Blue."

06:29.957 --> 06:32.192
Oh, you mean here!

06:32.225 --> 06:34.728
You didn't save me a seat.

06:34.762 --> 06:37.431
Uh, could you
move over one seat?

06:37.465 --> 06:39.767
I'm not getting up.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.668
This ought to be good.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.669
She looks like a bleeder.

06:46.507 --> 06:50.010
If I were you, I'd get up.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.816
Oh, it's good to be back
in the old auditorium.

06:55.849 --> 06:59.587
Those drama classes were
some of my sweetest memories.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.189
There's nothing like the rush
of an ensemble, young artists

07:02.222 --> 07:04.992
honing their crafts.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.694
You know, Jackie,
uh, all you did was

07:06.727 --> 07:09.162
pull the curtain up and down.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.363
All I did.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.635
ANNOUNCER: Good
evening, everyone.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.004
Our last presentation
of the evening

07:17.037 --> 07:19.406
comes from the ninth
grade history class.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.274
I hope you enjoy it.

07:21.308 --> 07:24.177
[applause]

07:27.247 --> 07:29.650
The great river flows.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.552
The mighty wind howls.

07:31.585 --> 07:35.255
Let me take you
back, back to a time

07:35.288 --> 07:38.726
when the harvest was
bountiful and the sun

07:38.759 --> 07:41.328
shone brightly across the
peaceful native plains.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.769
Curtain went up way too
fast, not smooth at all.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.238
Jerky.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.873
Well, maybe the
curtain puller found out

07:52.906 --> 07:55.342
that you were in the
audience and just

07:55.375 --> 07:59.079
freaked under the pressure.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.716
My father, we have prepared
vast amounts of food.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.318
Surely it is more
than our group needs.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.720
You are right, Running Deer.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.956
Let us invite the strangers
from across the big water

08:08.989 --> 08:12.225
to join us, for they
have no food themselves.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.228
Bring on our brothers
from far away land,

08:15.262 --> 08:18.766
they who call themselves
saints to join us and celebrate

08:18.799 --> 08:19.600
the great harvest.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.605
Welcome, brothers.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.007
Share in our bountiful feast.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.810
Looks like there's not
enough seats at the table.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.045
Then we shall
make more benches.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.346
Nah.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.983
Let's make some dead Indians!

08:36.016 --> 08:39.352
[music playing]

08:43.456 --> 08:44.858
Stop!

08:44.892 --> 08:47.761
We invited you here
in peace and harmony.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.530
Looks like we're going to have
to get medieval on this savage.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.431
Pow!

08:51.464 --> 08:52.265
Oh!

08:58.371 --> 09:03.210
[groaning]

09:18.125 --> 09:20.127
All right, DJ!

09:20.160 --> 09:21.228
Way to die!

09:21.261 --> 09:22.996
All right!

09:23.030 --> 09:26.466
I'd like to introduce
our teacher, Mr. Hill.

09:26.499 --> 09:29.436
[applause]

09:29.469 --> 09:32.806
[music playing]

09:38.846 --> 09:41.782
Well, how long you been
pulling the old curtain?

09:41.815 --> 09:44.051
This is my first time.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.552
I don't mean to be
rough, but it shows.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.020
You mind if I give you
a couple of pointers?

09:47.054 --> 09:48.121
Actually--

09:48.155 --> 09:51.625
You want to develop
a smooth, fluid rhythm.

09:51.659 --> 09:52.993
Don't pull the curtain up.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.762
Let the curtain pull you down.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.096
And that way you
can take a piece

09:56.129 --> 09:59.199
of that applause for yourself.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.169
I am so proud of you, son.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.805
You died real good.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.974
That was really
a cool play, DJ.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.509
And I'm not just saying
that because it's

10:09.542 --> 10:11.845
the only play I've ever seen.

10:11.879 --> 10:12.813
Hey, Mom!

10:12.846 --> 10:15.415
People are watching!

10:15.448 --> 10:16.349
I've been there, Deej.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.185
Safest thing to do
is just go limp.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.223
Jeez.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.157
Huh.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.292
God, Rosanne.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.560
Could you believe how
horrible that play was?

10:27.594 --> 10:28.896
What are you talking about?

10:28.929 --> 10:33.667
I give it two thumbs up, and
a couple other fingers too.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.369
Well, I'm just sorry
I let my son be in it.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.538
It was nothing but
violent propaganda.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.774
Hey, the play was violent
because that's the way

10:40.808 --> 10:41.942
everything was back then.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.945
Or don't you rent videotapes?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.914
Did I hear you
just defending that?

10:46.947 --> 10:47.881
Do you know what that was?

10:47.915 --> 10:48.782
Drivel.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.884
Yeah, drivel and tripe.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.452
Revisionist drivel and tripe.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.587
And that's the worst kind.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.556
I can't believe that you guys
still believe all the stuff

10:56.589 --> 10:58.091
they taught us in high school.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.993
Man, I'm just glad that
I was out in the smoking

11:00.027 --> 11:03.230
area the whole time.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.665
Listen, believing that
stuff in those history books

11:05.699 --> 11:08.368
is what got me
where I am today--

11:08.401 --> 11:12.305
assistant director of sales
for the Midwest division

11:12.339 --> 11:15.843
Mohawk Mutual and Life.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.978
American history comes
down to a couple of words.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.980
People came here
for the freedom.

11:20.013 --> 11:20.814
Excuse me?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.186
Yeah.

11:26.219 --> 11:32.459
Well, all I'm just
saying is that uh--

11:32.492 --> 11:35.495
I don't want my tax money going
towards this kind of violence

11:35.528 --> 11:36.830
in school.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.531
Oh, come on.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.333
I mean, violence
is the only truth

11:40.367 --> 11:42.035
that can cleanse the
corrupt bourgeois

11:42.069 --> 11:45.172
establishment of its
hypocrisy and inequality.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.140
That's Communist talk!

11:47.174 --> 11:49.542
No, that's college talk!

11:49.576 --> 11:52.012
Her first shift selling
lawn furniture at Walmart

11:52.045 --> 11:53.080
will cool her off.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.051
So you folks all
enjoy the play?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.887
- Oh, I thought it was great.
- Yeah.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.721
I thought it was pretty cool.
- Well, thanks for your support.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.990
Mm hm.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.324
You know, but some the
people here are kind of upset

12:04.357 --> 12:06.559
because the story
doesn't seem to agree

12:06.593 --> 12:10.831
with the Thanksgiving story they
read on the Butterball wrapper.

12:10.864 --> 12:14.201
Excuse me, but
it just so happens

12:14.234 --> 12:18.438
that my great, great, great
grandmother was an authentic--

12:18.471 --> 12:19.439
[in unison] Cherokee princess.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.310
I'm sorry.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.046
There's no such thing as a
princess among native people.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.114
You are so busted.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.819
And your roots are brown.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.087
[gasp]

12:34.121 --> 12:35.989
You've got to admit,
those pilgrims were brave.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.858
They came over here
and discovered America.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.093
How can they discover
America if my people already

12:40.127 --> 12:41.361
lived there?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.030
You know, that's like me
going outside and discovering

12:43.063 --> 12:45.398
someone else's Porsche.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.900
Yeah that's like
the time my husband

12:46.934 --> 12:48.969
shimmied up the telephone
pole and discovered cable.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.043
I thought it was
pretty cool, you know.

12:56.076 --> 13:01.181
But I have to tell you, I will
never laugh at "F Troop" again.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.951
No matter how funny
that Larry Storch is.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.718
Let me tell you about
the real Thanksgiving.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.087
This is what happened.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.290
You see, a long time ago when
my people met the Pilgrims,

13:10.323 --> 13:12.425
they called themselves saints.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.427
English people sure loved
to give themselves titles.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.034
My father, we have prepared
vast amounts of food.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.503
Surely it is more than we need.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.472
You're right, my son.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.475
Let's invite our brothers
from across the big water--

13:28.508 --> 13:30.677
they who called
themselves the Pilgrims--

13:30.710 --> 13:34.581
to join us in a feast
of thanks for giving.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.782
Come my brothers!

13:35.815 --> 13:36.616
You're welcome!

13:45.258 --> 13:47.694
Whose elk horn do
I have to blow to get

13:47.727 --> 13:48.728
something to eat around here?

13:53.566 --> 13:56.669
It's true the Pilgrims were
starving, and we fed them.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.506
We also taught them how to
grow corn and how to survive.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.508
And we could have taught
them so much more,

14:01.541 --> 14:04.011
but they stopped listening
because what we had to say

14:04.044 --> 14:05.412
didn't go along with
how they thought

14:05.445 --> 14:06.313
men and women should be.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.319
I saw ye.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.623
Thou was having impure thoughts.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.192
For shame!

14:19.226 --> 14:20.260
I--I-- I was not.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.662
I was-- I was just--

14:22.695 --> 14:24.531
yeah, I was.

14:24.564 --> 14:28.635
Now son, thou knowest
what this means.

14:28.668 --> 14:32.172
Grab ye a switch
and flog thyself.

14:32.205 --> 14:37.077
I get impure thoughts
when I do that too.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.178
Listen here, young man.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.181
Let me explaineth it for you.

14:41.214 --> 14:45.285
You see, male/female
interactions,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.654
they are but for
one purpose only--

14:47.687 --> 14:49.856
the production of children.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.725
Besides, I've heard it
is nothing to be enjoyed.

14:52.759 --> 14:56.296
Not if it's done right.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.564
Luckily, I'm barren.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.800
So my husband and I have
never been forced to have sex.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.370
Praise be to God!

15:03.403 --> 15:04.371
Amen.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.106
Yay.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.407
Praise be to God.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.015
Yes, I understand now.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.516
I will go flog myself.

15:19.186 --> 15:22.622
These people have no
lawyers, guns, or money.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.357
Ah, there's nothing
to stop us from making

15:24.391 --> 15:26.693
this our own golf course.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.562
They have strong backs,
they'll maketh fine caddies.

15:32.265 --> 15:36.203
Here, come and
enjoy our bounty.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.171
Bounty, the
quicker picker upper.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.646
What a bunch of buckleheads.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.482
Why don't you sit at
the table with the men?

15:49.516 --> 15:51.851
Nix, nix.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.253
We are trying to
keep their weight

15:53.286 --> 15:56.689
down for the swimsuit portion
of the Miss Pilgrim competition.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.392
We waiteth our turn and
happily pick off their bones.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.128
The men always eat first.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.037
But there's enough
food for everyone.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.871
Hey, Chief, Chief.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.373
This system worketh.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.774
Watch.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.010
Oh, dear.

16:17.044 --> 16:20.780
Go waiteth thou in the woods
until I have finished eating.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.950
When I am finished,
I will call thee.

16:23.983 --> 16:24.817
Yes, husband.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.424
To the system.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.759
To the system!

16:48.108 --> 16:50.777
Don't you knock?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.113
Sorry.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.214
Come in, young one.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.021
Nice hut.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.757
I've been watching
you and your people.

17:04.791 --> 17:09.596
And she would not approve of
the imbalance of your spirit.

17:09.629 --> 17:10.730
She?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.532
She who?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.102
Our Mother Earth.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.205
The Earth is a woman?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.740
No, that's nothing
but heathen talk.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.675
I'll tell you how
the world works.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.411
There is one god.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.446
He's in heaven
sitting on a throne

17:26.479 --> 17:28.014
so he can damn everything.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.017
The end.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.952
Daughter, sit.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.755
I have much to tell you.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.058
Heaven and Earth are the same.

17:39.092 --> 17:42.795
Man exists with woman.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.365
He's part of woman.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.334
Woman gives life to man.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.005
I cannot understand
what you're talking about.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.475
Well, you should understand.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.177
You're a woman.

17:57.210 --> 18:03.116
Women give life
like the Earth does.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.584
You thought all
this up while you were

18:04.617 --> 18:07.387
just sitting here in this hut?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.955
Well, I get out some.

18:08.988 --> 18:12.325
The occasional walk, you know.

18:12.359 --> 18:16.396
Roseanne, we art leaving.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.597
I don't know what to do.

18:17.630 --> 18:21.234
I would love to stay here
and learn more from you.

18:21.268 --> 18:26.072
Well, then buy my
cassette in the lobby.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.974
Roseanne!

18:28.007 --> 18:30.743
What was that?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.513
That's my husband,
Newton Gingrich Conner.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.086
Three sisters are
beans, squash, and corn.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.821
And?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.224
And they knew if they
planted them all together,

18:44.257 --> 18:45.325
they would grow taller.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.693
And?

18:46.726 --> 18:52.199
And-- and I hate having my
teacher over for Thanksgiving!

18:52.232 --> 18:53.800
Well, this has been great.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.335
Yeah, especially
since we invited you,

18:55.368 --> 18:57.837
and you brought all the food.
- I'll say.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.972
What are you doing next year?

19:00.006 --> 19:01.874
Well, you made that
delicious turkey.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.877
All I can say is,
thanks for giving.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.246
Well, this may
be a little late,

19:06.279 --> 19:09.282
but on behalf of the Pilgrims,
thanks for feeding us.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.418
Thanks for helping
us to understand

19:11.451 --> 19:13.286
more about your culture.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.755
But your people are
doing a lot better now,

19:15.788 --> 19:20.227
what with the casinos
and the cigarettes.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.763
Well said, Mrs. Harris.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.565
- Hey, Mr. Hill.
- Yeah?

19:25.598 --> 19:26.933
Why don't we do
the friendship dance?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.835
Friendship dance?
Floyd?

19:28.868 --> 19:32.171
Well, I just happened
to bring my drum.

19:35.308 --> 19:38.445
The drum is the heartbeat.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.679
[drumbeat]

19:39.712 --> 19:41.881
Well, I usually don't
dance till after last call,

19:41.914 --> 19:43.783
so you'll have to lead.

19:43.816 --> 19:44.751
Here, I'll show you.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.818
Nobody leads.

19:45.852 --> 19:46.753
Nobody leads.

19:52.825 --> 19:53.893
Hey, I get it.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.264
This is like that
Jewish dance, the Horah.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.533
And the hokey pokey!

20:00.567 --> 20:02.902
One people,

20:02.935 --> 20:05.305
We do this at
the senior center!

20:11.344 --> 20:14.213
[native american song]

20:29.228 --> 20:30.663
This is called
the Laughing Song.

20:30.697 --> 20:34.133
And it's for you, little buddy.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.069
[singing]

21:29.989 --> 21:32.291
[applause]

21:33.593 --> 21:35.362
Hey!

21:35.395 --> 21:39.265
[theme music]
